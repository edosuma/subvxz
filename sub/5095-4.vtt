00:07.025 --> 00:08.774
DANNY:
I gotta take a leak.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.693
BAEZ: How many times
do I have to tell you?

00:10.695 --> 00:12.528
Caffeine is a diuretic.

00:12.530 --> 00:13.863
A what?

00:13.865 --> 00:15.831
Just switch to decaf.

00:15.833 --> 00:18.417
What fun would
that be?

00:18.419 --> 00:20.202
About as much fun as waiting
around on this lowlife.

00:20.204 --> 00:21.337
Where the
hell is he?

00:21.339 --> 00:23.122
Think I like waiting
on a junkie dirtbag

00:23.124 --> 00:24.540
any more than you do?
(sighs)

00:24.542 --> 00:25.958
Well, you won't have
to wait much longer.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.009
Tour's almost over.

00:27.011 --> 00:28.928
He's your CI.

00:28.930 --> 00:30.429
(car door opening)

00:32.934 --> 00:34.050
You know, you're
gonna buy it,

00:34.052 --> 00:35.351
you ever pull a stunt
like that again.

00:35.353 --> 00:36.969
Oh, you think I like sneaking
around like this?

00:36.971 --> 00:38.721
I can't be seen
talking to you two.

00:38.723 --> 00:39.889
Well, start talking, then.

00:39.891 --> 00:41.057
Money first.

00:41.059 --> 00:43.609
What... I think
you're high already.

00:44.729 --> 00:46.062
Talk first.

00:46.064 --> 00:47.730
Who's the new fence buying up
all the swag

00:47.732 --> 00:48.898
in the
neighborhood?

00:48.900 --> 00:49.982
See, that's-that's
big information

00:49.984 --> 00:51.067
and you know it.

00:51.069 --> 00:52.401
I want $40 and
I want it up front.

00:52.403 --> 00:53.819
DANNY:
You didn't get it, did you?

00:53.821 --> 00:55.204
You didn't get a name,
you didn't get anything.

00:55.206 --> 00:56.372
I'm getting it,
all right?

00:56.374 --> 00:58.707
It's... and I got
a really good lead.

00:58.709 --> 01:00.576
I just... I just need
to get my fix first.

01:00.578 --> 01:01.578
BAEZ:
No info,

01:01.579 --> 01:03.295
no dough.

01:06.084 --> 01:08.584
Hey!

01:08.586 --> 01:10.136
Come here.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.670
Come here, come here.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.139
Give me the money.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.091
Hey. Listen.

01:15.093 --> 01:16.559
You ever pull a stunt
like that again,

01:16.561 --> 01:18.594
you're going in the river,
you got it?

01:18.596 --> 01:20.012
Get out of here.

01:20.014 --> 01:21.514
Come on. Go.

01:22.984 --> 01:25.101
Go on.

01:25.103 --> 01:27.069
JANKO:
Oh....

01:27.071 --> 01:30.055
It should be illegal,
what you're doing right now.

01:30.057 --> 01:31.690
What?
Sullying the reputation

01:31.692 --> 01:33.893
of this beautiful girl.
(man singing indistinctly)

01:33.895 --> 01:35.327
She'll get over it.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.113
I'll get over it.

Charlene,

01:50.178 --> 01:52.912
the least you could do

01:52.914 --> 01:54.713

Get one back

02:20.374 --> 02:21.574
It'll take two
minutes, partner.

02:21.576 --> 02:22.875
You're annoying,
you know that?

02:22.877 --> 02:23.909
I've been told.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.162
Two black.
Nah, I don't want one.

02:26.164 --> 02:27.413
Suit yourself.

02:27.415 --> 02:28.664
It's free.

02:28.666 --> 02:30.833
Thanks.

02:33.171 --> 02:35.154
I appreciate that.

02:35.156 --> 02:37.173

He's lying, Sarge.

05:13.949 --> 05:15.365
I didn't do nothing.
Not a thing?

05:15.367 --> 05:16.783
So he gave himself
a broken leg?

05:16.785 --> 05:18.001
I never put a hand on him.

05:18.003 --> 05:19.002
All right.
Walk me through it.

05:19.004 --> 05:20.620
I cornered
the suspect

05:20.622 --> 05:22.205
in the third
floor hallway,

05:22.207 --> 05:24.040
held him at gunpoint,
ordered him not to move.

05:24.042 --> 05:25.341
And then what
happened?

05:25.343 --> 05:26.376
He ran and jumped.

He jumped?
He jumped!

He jumped out a

05:29.548 --> 05:31.548
I'm telling you, he jumped!

05:31.550 --> 05:33.216
He just hurled his body
through that window

05:33.218 --> 05:34.851
out that a building
from almost 30 feet.

05:34.853 --> 05:35.885
That's your story?

05:35.887 --> 05:37.887
It's not a story.
It's the truth.

05:37.889 --> 05:39.722
Can you corroborate
any of this?

05:39.724 --> 05:41.057
He's telling the truth.

05:41.059 --> 05:42.775
So you saw it go down?

05:42.777 --> 05:44.777
No.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.279
I arrived
after the fact.

05:46.281 --> 05:48.064
Then how do you
know what happened?

05:48.066 --> 05:49.449
Because that's what
Danny said happened.

05:49.451 --> 05:50.567
Right.

05:50.569 --> 05:52.235
Good luck on the grand
jury with that one.

05:52.237 --> 05:53.536
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on...

05:53.538 --> 05:54.904
What are you talking about,
grand jury, Sarge?

05:54.906 --> 05:55.855
He's lying!

05:55.857 --> 05:56.990
Look around,
Detective.

05:56.992 --> 05:58.074
You're in the middle
of a megillah.

05:58.076 --> 05:59.292
Of all the places,

05:59.294 --> 06:01.411
and all the time, you
gotta pull a stunt like this

06:01.413 --> 06:03.046
in Reverend Potter's
backyard?

06:03.048 --> 06:04.030
POTTER:
It's okay, son.

06:04.032 --> 06:06.132
God is with you.
I am with you.

We are all with you!

06:12.591 --> 06:14.424
No! No!
No, we won't!

06:14.426 --> 06:16.609
Once again, the boys in blue

06:16.611 --> 06:18.394
have shown us their true colors.

06:18.396 --> 06:20.930
Not content with just being

06:20.932 --> 06:22.265
a police officer,

06:22.267 --> 06:26.102
today, a member of the New York
Police Brutality Department

06:26.104 --> 06:28.655
has decided that
he was judge, jury

06:28.657 --> 06:29.606
and executioner.

06:29.608 --> 06:30.907
Yeah, yeah!
That's right.

06:30.909 --> 06:32.108
Rather than just arrest

06:32.110 --> 06:34.911
this man and give him
his day in court,

06:34.913 --> 06:37.747
this cop threw him out a window.

06:37.749 --> 06:38.831
Lord have mercy.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.950
Now, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

06:40.952 --> 06:43.086
I'm afraid it gets worse.
MAN: What?

06:43.088 --> 06:44.287

06:46.124 --> 06:47.957
is not just any cop.

06:47.959 --> 06:49.459
Who...
No, sir.

06:49.461 --> 06:51.177
The cop who did this

06:51.179 --> 06:52.845
is no other

06:52.847 --> 06:54.130
than Commissioner Frank Reagan's

06:54.132 --> 06:55.965
own flesh and blood.

06:55.967 --> 06:56.983
That's right, y'all.

06:56.985 --> 06:58.134
(crowd exclaims)

06:58.136 --> 06:59.352
His own son!

06:59.354 --> 07:01.788
So now what are
we gonna do about that, y'all?

07:01.790 --> 07:03.306
We are gonna go down

07:03.308 --> 07:05.808
to Commissioner Frank Reagan's
doorstep.

07:05.810 --> 07:08.528
We are gonna go down to One PP!

07:08.530 --> 07:09.696
So, now, where we going?

07:09.698 --> 07:10.813
(chanting):
One PP!

07:10.815 --> 07:12.699
One PP!
CROWD: One PP!

07:12.701 --> 07:13.900

07:16.655 --> 07:18.154
Can we go home now?

07:19.107 --> 07:20.823
I think I'm feeling much better.

07:20.825 --> 07:22.075
JANKO:
That's great.

07:22.077 --> 07:23.876
We have to wait for
the doc to clear you.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.662
Well, when
will that be?

07:25.664 --> 07:27.830
I don't know.
When will that be?

07:27.832 --> 07:29.549
Why you looking at me?
What do you want me to do?

07:29.551 --> 07:31.084
(sighs)

07:31.086 --> 07:33.219
Why don't you go flash
those baby blues of yours

07:33.221 --> 07:34.887
at Dr. Lambchop over there?

07:36.925 --> 07:39.158
You think?

07:40.011 --> 07:42.178
It's worth a shot.

07:42.180 --> 07:44.681
How long do you want to be here?

07:44.683 --> 07:47.016
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

07:51.406 --> 07:52.522
Excuse me.

07:52.524 --> 07:55.358
I'll get to you
when I can, Officer.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.543
Uh, Doc, we've been waiting
here for over two hours.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.746
And I've been here
for over 26.

07:59.748 --> 08:00.913
And the day
before that, 32.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.081
And the day
before that, 28.

08:02.083 --> 08:03.416
Do you see where
I'm going with this, Officer?

08:03.418 --> 08:05.084
My days have more
than 24 hours in them.

08:05.086 --> 08:06.869
How is that
even possible?

08:06.871 --> 08:08.037
I'm sorry,
that was weird.

08:08.039 --> 08:09.255
No, I'm-I'm sorry.

08:09.257 --> 08:10.623
I was rude. Um...

08:10.625 --> 08:12.609
I shouldn't have
spoken to you that way.

08:12.611 --> 08:13.593
Wow.

08:13.595 --> 08:14.627
(laughs)

08:14.629 --> 08:16.179
What?

08:16.181 --> 08:18.431
That's the first decent thing
another human being

08:18.433 --> 08:20.717
has said to me

08:23.972 --> 08:25.638

not totally used

Jamie Reagan. P.O.

08:29.194 --> 08:30.860

a little rough at first,

08:30.862 --> 08:32.111
but you'll see, we come around.

08:32.113 --> 08:34.013
What's this?
Police courtesy card.

08:34.015 --> 08:35.063
It's like a get out

08:35.066 --> 08:36.899
of jail free card.
Use it anytime you get

08:36.900 --> 08:38.900
pulled over inside
the five boroughs.

08:39.904 --> 08:41.404
Thank you.

08:47.996 --> 08:50.079
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

08:50.081 --> 08:51.914
Use that if you ever
want to get a drink.

08:51.916 --> 08:53.750
Okay.

08:53.752 --> 08:55.535
Let's see about your guy.

08:55.537 --> 08:57.470
All right.

08:58.923 --> 09:00.506
POTTER: Where are we?
CROWD: One PP!

09:00.508 --> 09:02.041
Where are we?
One PP!

09:02.043 --> 09:03.760
Let me hear you!
One PP!

09:03.762 --> 09:05.678
Now, now, wait, wait, wait.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.347
I want to thank you all
for coming.

09:07.349 --> 09:08.514
'Cause it's only through

09:08.516 --> 09:11.601
your support that
we shall be heard.

09:11.603 --> 09:13.186
(cheering)
Hallelujah.

09:13.188 --> 09:14.937
Now, I want to introduce you
to someone

09:14.939 --> 09:16.773
who knows Detective Reagan
very well.

09:16.775 --> 09:18.274
Willie...

09:18.276 --> 09:19.776
why don't you tell us
what happened

09:19.778 --> 09:21.327
in your meeting

09:21.329 --> 09:22.695
with Detective Reagan,
earlier this morning?

09:22.697 --> 09:24.831
(clears throat)

09:24.833 --> 09:26.115
He hit me.

09:26.117 --> 09:27.283
(crowd exclaims)

09:27.285 --> 09:29.369
He hit you? Where?

09:30.672 --> 09:33.289
Well, first he smacked me
in the head

09:33.291 --> 09:34.791
and then he kicked me.

09:34.793 --> 09:36.793
(crowd exclaims)

09:36.795 --> 09:38.928
And he kicked you,
as well?

09:38.930 --> 09:40.079
That's right.

09:40.081 --> 09:41.514
In the butt.

09:41.516 --> 09:43.466
(crowd booing)

09:43.468 --> 09:46.602
So he smacked you in the head
and kicked you in the behind.

09:46.604 --> 09:48.471
Well, surely you must have
been doing something illegal.

09:48.473 --> 09:51.023
Something that must have
warranted this kind of abuse.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.142
No, sir.

09:53.144 --> 09:56.062
He was mad 'cause he heard
there was a new fence

09:56.064 --> 09:58.231
in the neighborhood
and he wanted his name.

09:58.233 --> 10:00.316
But I didn't know it.

10:00.318 --> 10:01.401
(crowd exclaiming)

10:01.403 --> 10:02.568
Did you hear that?

10:02.570 --> 10:04.987
This man was beaten
over the head

10:04.989 --> 10:07.156
and stomped on
by Detective Reagan

10:07.158 --> 10:08.958
because he didn't know
who was selling

10:08.960 --> 10:10.193
stolen goods
in the neighborhood?

10:10.195 --> 10:12.378
(clamoring)

10:12.380 --> 10:13.913
Do y'all know who
the new fence is?

10:13.915 --> 10:15.214
'Cause I sure don't.

10:15.216 --> 10:17.717
Let's hope we don't run
into Detective Reagan,

10:17.719 --> 10:19.585
unless we catch ourselves
a beat down!

10:19.587 --> 10:20.970
(crowd cheering)

10:20.972 --> 10:22.655
POTTER: Does this sound right to you?
CROWD: No!

10:22.679 --> 10:24.390
You need to hold
a press conference.

10:24.392 --> 10:26.559
And say what?
Anything.

10:26.561 --> 10:27.977
There's nothing to say.

10:27.979 --> 10:29.178
We don't have all the facts.

10:29.180 --> 10:32.098
Read the five-day forecast,
for all I care.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.767
Potter can heat up some hearsay
and half-truths

10:34.769 --> 10:36.269
and turn them into
his Gettysburg Address;

10:36.271 --> 10:37.520
it's what he does.

10:37.522 --> 10:38.688
I can't.

10:38.690 --> 10:40.857
I don't want to and I won't.

10:40.859 --> 10:42.191
Your willingness
to appear on camera

10:42.193 --> 10:43.693
would signal support for Danny.

10:45.580 --> 10:48.030
You know someone who thinks
I'm not supporting my son?

10:48.032 --> 10:49.782
The impression your silence...
Give me a name

10:49.784 --> 10:52.368
and address and I'll send 'em
a hand-written note.

10:52.370 --> 10:53.786
I'm gonna tell you
I told you so.

10:53.788 --> 10:54.921
Told me so, what?

10:54.923 --> 10:56.456
You need to pick
a new Chief of Department.

10:56.458 --> 10:57.707
Oh, please.

10:57.709 --> 10:58.708
A highest-ranking uniform,

10:58.710 --> 11:00.793
for exactly situations
like this.

11:00.795 --> 11:02.011
Like this?

11:02.013 --> 11:04.046
Like when my son is being
accused of brutality?

11:04.048 --> 11:05.965
Like when you want
to put out the word,

11:05.967 --> 11:07.433
but you don't want
to put out the final word.

11:07.435 --> 11:09.602
Like when you need
to duck and stall

11:09.604 --> 11:12.054
with authority
and proper protocol.

11:12.056 --> 11:14.390
I am not trying
to duck and stall.

11:14.392 --> 11:16.392
Of course you are.

11:16.394 --> 11:17.743
You don't have a choice.

11:17.745 --> 11:21.898
And you fired
your right-hand months ago.

11:22.734 --> 11:24.901
(door closes)

11:25.703 --> 11:28.237
(no audio)

11:28.239 --> 11:30.406
(sighs)

11:32.160 --> 11:34.327
Reagan.

11:36.965 --> 11:39.081
I've been asked to send you
to the record room

11:39.083 --> 11:40.249
soon as you get in.

11:40.251 --> 11:41.334
Great.

11:41.336 --> 11:42.502
Internal Affairs?

11:42.504 --> 11:43.836
Reagan, if it is IAB--

11:43.838 --> 11:46.589
you shut your hole
and get a lawyer.

12:00.989 --> 12:03.189
Shut the door.

12:13.797 --> 12:15.964
Take a seat.

12:16.605 --> 12:17.483
Dad...

12:17.484 --> 12:20.266
Sit.

12:24.558 --> 12:27.358
I got to ask.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.960
On advice of counsel?

12:28.962 --> 12:31.262
Don't be a wise-ass.

12:31.264 --> 12:33.364
What's the alternative?

12:33.366 --> 12:35.266
That my old man thinks
I threw some guy

12:35.268 --> 12:36.401
out of a third-story window?

12:36.403 --> 12:39.003
I never thought that
for a second.

12:40.807 --> 12:42.273
Then what'd you come to ask?

12:43.527 --> 12:46.661
(sighs heavily)

12:46.663 --> 12:49.831
Events leading up.

12:49.833 --> 12:51.783
Events leading up are...

12:51.785 --> 12:55.170
pursued the suspect
into the hallway,

12:55.172 --> 12:56.788
and he just got
it into his head

12:56.790 --> 12:58.506
that he could spread
his wings and fly.

12:58.508 --> 12:59.791
You lay hands on him?

12:59.793 --> 13:01.209
Never got close enough.

13:01.211 --> 13:02.343
Are you certain?

13:02.345 --> 13:03.561
Dust the clown for prints--

13:03.563 --> 13:04.679
you will not find mine.

13:04.681 --> 13:05.764
Witnesses?

13:05.766 --> 13:09.300
A kid, he opened
his apartment door,

13:09.302 --> 13:10.969
but I told him
to get back inside.

13:10.971 --> 13:12.971
He comply?
As far as I know.

13:12.973 --> 13:14.973
My attention was elsewhere,
on the suspect.

13:14.975 --> 13:18.693
Which, I believe, the
department manual would advise.

13:20.730 --> 13:23.565
Look...

13:23.567 --> 13:25.483
I got to do this retail.

13:25.485 --> 13:28.486
I got to look under every rock
before the other guy does.

13:28.488 --> 13:29.821
Potter?

13:29.823 --> 13:31.573
Yeah.

13:31.575 --> 13:33.124
Where the hell does this guy
get all this power?

13:33.126 --> 13:37.045
Some he grabbed, some he earned.

13:37.047 --> 13:41.216
Some we gave him
and his like over the years,

13:41.218 --> 13:44.969
on a silver platter.

13:44.971 --> 13:46.971
Danny, think.

13:46.973 --> 13:49.340
Is there anything
I need to know?

13:51.178 --> 13:52.560
Yeah.

13:52.562 --> 13:55.063
I might have told the guy to get
your hands against the wall,

13:55.065 --> 13:56.548
or I'll throw you
out the window.

13:56.550 --> 13:58.016
Just mouthing off?

13:58.018 --> 13:59.184
Yes.

13:59.186 --> 14:00.318
Anybody hear you?

14:00.320 --> 14:01.986
He did.

14:01.988 --> 14:04.072
That's probably
where he got the idea.

14:04.074 --> 14:06.107
The kid?

14:06.109 --> 14:08.026
I don't know.

14:08.028 --> 14:09.828
Or a neighbor, maybe.

14:09.830 --> 14:11.863
But I couldn't know.

14:12.999 --> 14:14.365
Well...

14:14.367 --> 14:15.834
we'll soon find out.

14:29.049 --> 14:31.516
Not for a second.

14:40.393 --> 14:42.877
(door closes)

14:42.879 --> 14:45.697
So, you gonna
call her, Reagan?

14:45.699 --> 14:48.533
Who?

14:48.535 --> 14:50.401
What, you
mean the doc?

14:50.403 --> 14:52.904
Yeah, the doc.

14:52.906 --> 14:54.689
Well, why you asking
me about that?

14:54.691 --> 14:56.741
Why you being weird
all of a sudden?

14:56.743 --> 14:58.376
We're partners, we talk
about pretty much everything.

14:58.378 --> 15:00.495
We don't usually talk
about that stuff.

15:00.497 --> 15:02.163
We don't? Is that,
like, a new rule?

15:02.165 --> 15:05.366
No, it's just that
that one time when we, uh...

15:05.368 --> 15:06.968
Where we what?

15:06.970 --> 15:08.636
You know, I just don't want
things to get weird.

15:08.638 --> 15:10.421
Well, then you need to stop
making things weird.

15:10.423 --> 15:11.839
How am I making it weird?

15:11.841 --> 15:13.725
Because you're acting
like a typical guy.

15:13.727 --> 15:15.181
I mean, look, we spend
a lot of time together.

15:15.181 --> 15:16.264
We get along.

15:16.265 --> 15:18.673
One night, we went out,
we had a few drinks,

15:18.674 --> 15:20.363
and we ended up kissing.

15:20.363 --> 15:22.093
It happens all the time.

15:22.094 --> 15:23.296
O-Okay.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.111
Do I look like
I'm carrying a torch here?

15:25.111 --> 15:26.530
No. No.

15:26.531 --> 15:27.924
Well, then you need
to get over yourself.

15:27.925 --> 15:30.256
You're the one who started
this conversation, not me.

15:30.257 --> 15:31.785
I thought we were friends.

15:31.786 --> 15:32.858
We are.

15:32.859 --> 15:34.723
Well, that's
what friends do, Reagan.

15:34.724 --> 15:36.664
They share with each other

15:35.636 --> 15:37.196
things that are going on
in their lives.

15:37.919 --> 15:39.451
All right, fine.

15:39.452 --> 15:40.852
Y-You want me to share?

15:41.922 --> 15:45.340
We went out last night.

15:45.342 --> 15:46.958
You and the doc,
y-you already...

15:46.960 --> 15:48.042
you went out?

15:48.044 --> 15:49.677
Yeah, met for a drink.

15:49.679 --> 15:51.679
Oh.

15:51.681 --> 15:53.047
(stammering):
Good... that's...

15:53.049 --> 15:55.383
good, you know,
good for you, you know.

15:57.721 --> 16:00.221
Expired registration.

16:08.031 --> 16:10.532
BRENNAN:
You're very quiet today.

16:10.534 --> 16:13.701
Osso buco this good, it'd be
a sin to talk through it.

16:13.703 --> 16:17.405
What's on your mind, Frank?

16:17.407 --> 16:20.158
Actually...

16:20.160 --> 16:24.212
I could use a little
professional advice.

16:24.214 --> 16:26.464
I will do my best.

16:26.466 --> 16:29.968
I'm in the cage with Reverend
Darnell Potter again.

16:29.970 --> 16:31.636
So I heard.

16:31.639 --> 16:35.224
But I would like
to handle it...

16:35.225 --> 16:37.258
better this time.

16:37.260 --> 16:39.043
Unlike the other times.

16:39.045 --> 16:41.429
The Lord loves a trier, right?

16:41.431 --> 16:43.214
So they say, Frank. So they say.

16:43.216 --> 16:46.434
But this time it is different.

16:46.436 --> 16:50.238
He is dragging my son through
the mud, for his own purposes.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.523
So, it's personal.

16:52.525 --> 16:53.992
It sure as hell is.

16:53.994 --> 16:55.276
Sorry.

16:56.780 --> 16:59.864
He is still...

16:59.866 --> 17:01.833
a man of the cloth, like you.

17:01.835 --> 17:05.453
Albeit a sharkskin suit
kind of cloth, from what I know.

17:08.258 --> 17:12.710
How do I defend against a man
without offending his flock?

17:12.712 --> 17:14.662
Without insulting their faith?

17:14.664 --> 17:17.131
May I quote Scripture?

17:17.133 --> 17:19.717
Not unless you want
to put me to sleep.

17:19.719 --> 17:21.185
From the book of John,

17:21.186 --> 17:22.804
“Even if a brother
has done us wrong,

17:22.806 --> 17:25.272
“we will not want to injure
that brother's credibility

17:25.275 --> 17:26.473
within the body.”

17:26.476 --> 17:28.559
What's the body?

17:28.560 --> 17:30.812
The community.

17:30.814 --> 17:32.280
And how do you get that done?

17:32.282 --> 17:34.616
By delivering
your complaint in private.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.651
With the respect of discretion.

17:36.653 --> 17:39.370
Scripture give an example?

17:39.372 --> 17:42.874
Yes, from the book
of <i> The Godfather: Part II.</i>

17:42.876 --> 17:44.492
Yeah.

17:44.494 --> 17:46.327
When Michael confronts Fredo

17:46.329 --> 17:48.713
about his treachery,

17:48.715 --> 17:50.965
he says,
“I know it was you, Fredo.

17:50.967 --> 17:54.002
You broke my heart,
you broke my heart.”

17:54.004 --> 17:56.337
He delivers his accusation
right into Fredo's ear.

17:56.339 --> 17:58.473
It's just between
the two of them.

17:59.809 --> 18:03.177
Despite Michael's anger,
he hides it from their community

18:03.180 --> 18:07.016
so that the community
might preserve.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.108
I'm here.

18:17.110 --> 18:18.409
Good.

18:18.411 --> 18:20.495
Follow me.

18:20.497 --> 18:21.696
Detective Powell.

18:21.698 --> 18:24.699
This is Detective
Reagan. Tell him.

18:24.701 --> 18:25.701
Tell me what?

18:25.702 --> 18:26.784
Look, I don't know
if I'm even right.

18:26.786 --> 18:29.253
Like I said,
it was just a hunch.

18:29.255 --> 18:31.372
I had Powell re-canvass
the apartment building.

18:31.374 --> 18:33.541
He spoke to the family
that lived

18:33.543 --> 18:36.878
off the hall from where
our guy went out the window.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.346
Okay.

18:38.348 --> 18:40.765
What did they say?

18:40.767 --> 18:43.551
Well, like I told you,
my Spanish ain't much.

18:43.553 --> 18:45.470
For the most part,

18:45.472 --> 18:47.772
they just kept saying
that they didn't see anything.

18:47.774 --> 18:49.891
Okay. So, what
are we doing here?

18:49.893 --> 18:52.060
Get to the boy.

18:53.196 --> 18:55.029
Little boy?

18:55.031 --> 18:56.114
Son of a bitch.

18:56.116 --> 18:57.865
There was a little boy,
came out in the hallway

18:57.867 --> 18:59.450
when I had my gun
on Lincoln.

18:59.452 --> 19:00.952
I-I told him
to go back inside, though.

19:00.954 --> 19:02.737
I think he might have
snuck a peak.

19:02.739 --> 19:04.906
What makes you think that?

19:04.908 --> 19:06.908
Well, like I told you,
my Spanish ain't much,

19:06.910 --> 19:08.126
but, uh...

19:08.128 --> 19:12.163
kind of heard him tell his
parents something like--

19:12.165 --> 19:14.749
the black guy was going crazy
and jumped out the window.

19:14.752 --> 19:17.302
And when Powell asked him
to repeat it in English,

19:17.303 --> 19:18.503
so we could take a statement,

19:18.505 --> 19:19.971
the parents said
the kid saw nothing,

19:19.973 --> 19:23.091
and they shut the door
in his face.

19:23.093 --> 19:25.643
They're illegals,
I think they got spooked.

19:28.565 --> 19:30.898
I get it.

19:30.900 --> 19:32.934
Let's un-spook them.

19:36.823 --> 19:38.773
Hey, Eddie.

19:38.775 --> 19:39.907
You see tomorrow's
roll call?

19:39.909 --> 19:41.325
Renzulli's got you riding
out with McKenna.

19:41.327 --> 19:42.777
You want me to straighten
this out?

19:42.779 --> 19:43.995
No, Jamie. I did that.

19:43.997 --> 19:46.280
You did?

19:46.282 --> 19:48.166
Yeah, McKenna was asking around
for someone to ride with,

19:48.168 --> 19:50.451
and I just thought it might be
a nice change of pace.

19:50.454 --> 19:52.588
Okay.

19:52.590 --> 19:55.071
What? It's just one ride.

19:55.072 --> 19:58.023
Absence makes the heart
grow fonder, right?

19:58.025 --> 20:00.492
Right.

20:00.493 --> 20:02.493
What's wrong?

20:02.496 --> 20:04.079
Nothing.

20:04.081 --> 20:07.533
Come on, something's
on your mind.

20:07.534 --> 20:09.834
Over a year together, and
I can count on one hand

20:09.836 --> 20:12.120
the number of times we haven't
rolled out as partners.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.922
What are you saying?

20:13.923 --> 20:16.374
I'm saying,
it's some coincidence.

20:16.377 --> 20:19.111
I-I'm saying maybe you're upset
I went out with Jenn?

20:19.112 --> 20:20.461
(laughs)

20:20.463 --> 20:22.130
Uh. Well, for your information,

20:22.133 --> 20:24.016
McKenna's running
a decoy unit tomorrow,

20:24.017 --> 20:26.351
and he needs a female
to pose as a hooker.

20:26.353 --> 20:28.770
That's why I agreed
to ride with him.

20:28.772 --> 20:31.272
Janko, I-I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

20:31.274 --> 20:32.557
Yeah, I know you didn't know,

20:32.559 --> 20:34.559
but I-I appreciate the
conclusion you jumped to.

20:34.561 --> 20:36.728
Jackass.

20:42.536 --> 20:44.536
Garrett, I need you
to reach out to Potter.

20:44.537 --> 20:46.204
Why aren't you
in the Compstat meeting?

20:46.207 --> 20:48.574
Because I'm here, I need you
to reach out to Potter.

20:48.576 --> 20:51.360
And I will, but I need you
in that meeting.

20:51.361 --> 20:53.061
So you say, but...

20:53.063 --> 20:53.995
It's Lieutenant Trumbull's turn

20:53.997 --> 20:55.546
in the Chief
of Department's chair.

20:55.548 --> 20:57.498
He's the last best candidate,
and you need to make a decision.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.333
I need you to
reach out to Potter.

20:59.335 --> 21:00.551
Came up
through the ranks.

21:00.553 --> 21:01.753
Decorated twice.

21:01.755 --> 21:03.638
Three different master's
from John Jay,

21:03.640 --> 21:05.556
including
business management.

21:05.558 --> 21:09.594
Fielding offers from the PD
in Boston, Chicago and Miami.

21:09.596 --> 21:11.512
I'm taking you
down there myself.

21:11.515 --> 21:12.515
That's not necessary.

21:12.515 --> 21:14.599
Frank, I can be a lot
of things to you,

21:14.601 --> 21:17.018
chief cook
to bottle washer,

21:17.021 --> 21:19.488
and it's my honor and pleasure
to serve as best I can,

21:19.489 --> 21:21.406
but I cannot be
Chief of Department.

21:21.408 --> 21:23.074
(Frank sighs)

21:23.076 --> 21:25.276
And you need one.

21:28.582 --> 21:30.199
TRUMBULL:
Sergeant Gormley.

21:30.201 --> 21:32.534
From the look of
these numbers,

21:32.536 --> 21:34.453
you are leading one of the top
detective squads in the city.

21:34.454 --> 21:36.504
I got good cops.

21:36.506 --> 21:37.638
Your squad has cleared
more homicides

21:37.640 --> 21:38.790
than any other in the city.

21:38.792 --> 21:39.757
You don't deserve any credit?

21:39.759 --> 21:42.427
Only for staying
out of their way.

21:42.430 --> 21:44.213
(chuckling)

21:44.214 --> 21:46.097
Perhaps you should get in their
way a little more often.

21:46.099 --> 21:47.265
Chief?

21:47.267 --> 21:49.100
One of your detectives
stands accused

21:49.102 --> 21:51.436
of throwing a man
out of a third-story window.

21:51.439 --> 21:52.938
And the main
reason that charge

21:52.939 --> 21:55.022
is being so thoroughly
investigated

21:55.024 --> 21:56.140
is because Detective Reagan has

21:56.142 --> 21:58.192
a reputation
for being aggressive.

21:58.195 --> 22:01.480
A reputation which he has earned
while under your supervision.

22:01.481 --> 22:03.147
(door opens)
MAN: Ten-hut.

22:03.149 --> 22:04.482
FRANK:
Carry on.

22:04.484 --> 22:06.100
(door closes)

22:06.102 --> 22:09.403
Uh, the surge in push-in
robberies in your precinct is

22:09.406 --> 22:10.823
is at a historic
year-to-year high.

22:10.824 --> 22:13.157
What is your squad doing
to nail this spike back down?

22:13.159 --> 22:14.659
Can you speak to
that, Sergeant?

22:14.661 --> 22:17.211
What were you speaking
to when I walked in?

22:19.082 --> 22:20.331
Sir?

22:20.333 --> 22:23.784
I walked in, a page got turned.

22:26.506 --> 22:29.090
Sergeant?

22:29.093 --> 22:32.394
All due respect, sir,
the chief's at the wheel.

22:32.395 --> 22:33.427
All due respect,
Sergeant.

22:33.429 --> 22:35.546
I asked you the question.

22:35.548 --> 22:38.599
Detective Reagan's situation.

22:38.601 --> 22:40.568
And my part in its, um...

22:40.571 --> 22:42.321
origins.

22:42.322 --> 22:43.488
That sound right?

22:43.490 --> 22:45.022
I was asking the
sergeant, sir,

22:45.025 --> 22:47.526
if his management style
might've given the men and women

22:47.527 --> 22:50.027
under his command reason
to suppose that

22:50.029 --> 22:52.029
showing results outweighed

22:52.031 --> 22:54.699
proper procedure
in obtaining those results.

22:54.701 --> 22:57.919
Men and women or one man?

23:00.390 --> 23:03.791
I was using Detective Reagan
as an example, sir.

23:05.044 --> 23:07.128
Sergeant?

23:07.130 --> 23:09.630
I forgot the question, sir.

23:09.632 --> 23:11.199
Do you need me
to repeat it for you?

23:11.201 --> 23:12.600
No. I don't know.

23:12.602 --> 23:13.734
However you put it,

23:13.736 --> 23:14.886
I don't know.

23:14.888 --> 23:15.888
Sergeant Gormley?

23:15.889 --> 23:17.655
GORMLEY:
Look, when I came on this job,

23:17.657 --> 23:19.640
it was just that.

23:19.642 --> 23:21.142
A job.

23:21.144 --> 23:24.462
A steady paycheck
with decent benefits

23:24.464 --> 23:26.113
for a working class guy

23:26.115 --> 23:27.865
to support his family on.

23:27.867 --> 23:30.902
Now you got guys
with master's degrees

23:30.904 --> 23:33.738
in Tactical Police Strategies.

23:33.740 --> 23:35.690
PhDs in Restorative

23:35.692 --> 23:38.709
Justice in Urban Policing.

23:38.711 --> 23:40.461
Your point?

23:40.464 --> 23:43.765
I liked this department
the way it used to be.

23:43.766 --> 23:46.000
When a Danny Reagan would

23:46.002 --> 23:47.969
get a tip of the cap instead

23:47.971 --> 23:51.923
of a <i> rip</i> every time
he did what had to be done!

23:51.925 --> 23:54.592
And there's
no Compstat hot seat

23:54.594 --> 23:57.929
hot enough to make me
feel otherwise.

24:04.604 --> 24:06.737
Come on, police! Open up!

24:06.739 --> 24:07.855
What do you think?

24:07.857 --> 24:09.273
They're probably just scared.

24:10.076 --> 24:12.410
You're not in any trouble.

24:12.412 --> 24:14.946
We just want to talk.

24:14.948 --> 24:17.248
<i>No están allí.</i>

24:17.250 --> 24:18.449
Do you know
when they will be back?

24:18.451 --> 24:19.784
They moved.
Whoa, what... When?

24:19.786 --> 24:21.035
When?

24:21.038 --> 24:22.337
In the middle of the night.

24:22.339 --> 24:25.457
They move and they say
they never coming back.

24:41.607 --> 24:44.474
Reverend Potter, sir.

24:49.214 --> 24:51.415
(door closes)

24:54.476 --> 24:56.710
Thanks for meeting me
in private.

24:56.712 --> 24:58.011
Thanks for the invitation.

24:58.013 --> 25:00.414
Private is the two of us only.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.716
Well, he's here.

25:04.219 --> 25:05.886
He was just leaving.

25:14.196 --> 25:16.763
I've about exhausted

25:16.765 --> 25:18.732
the pleasantries, you?

25:18.734 --> 25:21.068
We agree on something.

25:21.070 --> 25:22.836
Can we agree on another?

25:22.838 --> 25:25.205
We don't like each other.

25:25.207 --> 25:28.709
But we can respect one another's

25:28.711 --> 25:31.278
positions and respective
institutions.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.814
I don't feel your respect.

25:33.816 --> 25:35.615
I asked you to speak in private.

25:35.617 --> 25:38.352
I didn't vilify you in public.

25:38.354 --> 25:39.686
You don't need
the public square.

25:39.688 --> 25:43.390
You command the forces
of might, right and white.

25:43.392 --> 25:45.392
Give me a break, Rev.

25:45.394 --> 25:48.261
There's no cameras
or microphones in here.

25:52.668 --> 25:55.569
Why don't you sit down?

26:01.010 --> 26:04.811
I'd like to offer you a gift.

26:04.813 --> 26:08.582
Generous, but, um,
as commissioner,

26:08.584 --> 26:10.450
I'm afraid I can't accept.

26:10.452 --> 26:11.985
How about as a father?

26:11.987 --> 26:14.988
Tread carefully there.

26:16.091 --> 26:19.659
An elegant solution
to an ugly dilemma.

26:21.397 --> 26:25.399
Detective Reagan
retires from the NYPD,

26:25.401 --> 26:27.701
and we drop the whole thing.

26:27.703 --> 26:29.503
No grand jury.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.138
No charges.

26:31.140 --> 26:32.572
You can't promise no charges.

26:32.574 --> 26:34.007
You don't have the power.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.442
They're not yours to bring.

26:35.444 --> 26:36.810
No grand jury.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.178
You can't promise that either.

26:38.180 --> 26:40.347
That's up to
the district attorney.

26:40.349 --> 26:43.517
You and I both know that if
I call off the pressure...

26:46.255 --> 26:49.322
What exactly have you got?

26:49.324 --> 26:51.425
Ernesto Rodriquez.

26:51.427 --> 26:54.127
Little boy across the hall
who saw the whole thing.

26:54.129 --> 26:56.213
He's ready to say
he saw your son

26:56.215 --> 26:58.415
push Jessy Lincoln
out the window.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.267
Your words in his mouth.

27:00.269 --> 27:01.468
His words,

27:01.470 --> 27:02.719
Commissioner.

27:02.721 --> 27:04.137
His eyewitness account.

27:04.139 --> 27:05.338
If this boy witnessed

27:05.340 --> 27:06.890
a crime he should
be interviewed

27:06.892 --> 27:08.692
by my detectives,

27:08.694 --> 27:12.562
the district attorney's office
and Child Services.

27:12.564 --> 27:14.698
So you can deliver
him and his family

27:14.700 --> 27:18.535
to Immigration and put him on
the first boat back to Mexico?

27:22.324 --> 27:26.126
Look, I will
personally guarantee

27:26.128 --> 27:29.045
his family immunity
from deportation.

27:29.047 --> 27:31.581
And...

27:31.583 --> 27:34.835
we can make
the announcement together.

27:34.837 --> 27:37.838
The only interview
Ernesto will be giving

27:37.840 --> 27:39.806
is to the media.

27:39.808 --> 27:41.758
Unless...

27:41.760 --> 27:43.510
Unless my son resigns

27:43.512 --> 27:46.313
from the NYPD.

27:46.315 --> 27:48.715
That's what's on the table.

27:48.717 --> 27:50.150
Why are you doing this?

27:50.152 --> 27:52.402
What do you hope to gain
from this charade?

27:52.404 --> 27:55.572
The trust of the people.

27:55.574 --> 27:58.275
And their faith
that the NYPD

27:58.277 --> 28:01.044
can and will be
held accountable.

28:01.046 --> 28:03.029
(laughs softly)

28:03.031 --> 28:06.032
I'll say this--
you're good at what you do.

28:06.034 --> 28:08.602
It's a pity that what you do

28:08.604 --> 28:11.538
is so damn corrupt.

28:11.540 --> 28:15.058
That's not a word I'd be
tossing around, Mr. Reagan.

28:22.434 --> 28:25.051
You let me know.

28:35.898 --> 28:38.231
But you didn't do it.

28:38.233 --> 28:39.366
No, I didn't do it.

28:39.368 --> 28:40.984
So, why don't
you just say that?

28:40.986 --> 28:43.620
'Cause it's not
that simple, kiddo.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.238
But Potter knows
you didn't do it.

28:45.240 --> 28:47.157
That doesn't matter to him.

28:47.159 --> 28:48.458
NICKY:
This is ridiculous.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.193
HENRY: Until you're the one
in the spotlight.

28:50.195 --> 28:51.578
Then it becomes a nightmare.

28:51.580 --> 28:52.812
Ever happen to you?

28:52.814 --> 28:54.214
The Knapp Commission.

28:54.216 --> 28:55.999
Every cop with a
stripe on his sleeve

28:56.001 --> 28:59.252
was guilty
until he was proved innocent.

28:59.254 --> 29:00.921
That's overstating it, Pop.

29:00.923 --> 29:02.722
You weren't there, Francis.

29:02.724 --> 29:04.074
That's how we felt.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.592
NICKY:
I still don't get why though.

29:05.594 --> 29:07.344
I mean, what did Uncle Danny
ever do to Reverend Potter?

29:07.346 --> 29:08.762
Because he carries
my last name.

29:08.764 --> 29:10.847
And Pop's. Two PC's.

29:10.849 --> 29:12.816
Okay, now you're overstating it.

29:12.818 --> 29:14.434
It was a specific incident.

29:14.436 --> 29:16.736
Two blocks from his church.
Yes and yes.

29:16.738 --> 29:19.105
But he's one in a long line
that thinks of the police

29:19.107 --> 29:21.942
as an occupying force
and fancies himself

29:21.944 --> 29:23.610
as leader of the resistance.

29:23.612 --> 29:25.745
So, when opportunity
knocks as it did here,

29:25.747 --> 29:28.081
Potter heads for the door.

29:28.083 --> 29:29.416
It is just so wrong.

29:29.418 --> 29:31.001
Look, it is
what it is.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.285
JACK: What, so you're
not gonna fight it?

29:32.287 --> 29:34.454
When you interviewed Ernesto,

29:34.456 --> 29:35.789
the family had moved, right?

29:35.791 --> 29:36.791
Right.

29:36.792 --> 29:38.258
Why?

29:38.260 --> 29:40.093
They were illegal. I'm
sure they were afraid

29:40.095 --> 29:41.845
we were gonna come
back and get them.

29:41.847 --> 29:43.346
Yeah. But where'd they move?

29:43.348 --> 29:45.799
We couldn't know.

29:45.801 --> 29:47.384
No one helped them pack?

29:47.386 --> 29:48.551
Lent them a car?

29:48.553 --> 29:50.887
Got a forwarding address?

29:52.391 --> 29:54.808
No one that we could
get out of them.

29:54.810 --> 29:56.526
Well, somebody did.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.945
Somebody sponsored
that relocation.

29:58.947 --> 30:01.114
Had to have.

30:01.116 --> 30:03.366
Don't you think?

30:06.605 --> 30:09.322
Excuse me.

30:09.324 --> 30:11.491
You're gonna need a subpoena.

30:12.995 --> 30:15.478
Uh...

30:15.480 --> 30:18.164
what just happened?

30:21.503 --> 30:23.670
(distant siren wailing)

30:24.756 --> 30:26.256
Sorry about the
short notice, Greg.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.258
Aw, we're the

30:27.259 --> 30:29.976
original 24-hour store.

30:31.179 --> 30:32.345
Well...

30:32.347 --> 30:34.931
I took your advice
about Reverend Potter.

30:34.933 --> 30:37.851
But you didn't come here
with the good news.

30:37.853 --> 30:40.854
If there was ever
any respect there, it's gone.

30:40.856 --> 30:43.690
He insisted I give up
my son to his agenda.

30:43.692 --> 30:44.908
Or else.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.977
I see.

30:46.979 --> 30:49.195
I can't protect against him
without exposing him.

30:49.197 --> 30:51.364
Can't or won't, Frank?

30:53.368 --> 30:55.235
Both, I guess.

30:55.237 --> 30:57.871
And you want
what from me?

30:57.873 --> 31:00.156
My blessing to
take him out?

31:03.512 --> 31:06.379
How much mercy
am I required to show?

31:06.381 --> 31:08.715
Well, there isn't any
metric that I know of.

31:08.717 --> 31:10.600
You show as much
mercy as you can.

31:10.602 --> 31:11.968
It's as simple...

31:11.970 --> 31:14.854
and as complicated as that.

31:29.404 --> 31:30.737
A left.

31:30.739 --> 31:32.572
Huh.

31:36.078 --> 31:37.744
Another left.

31:37.746 --> 31:38.995
He's circling the block.

31:38.997 --> 31:41.081
Dry cleaning.
He's definitely going

31:41.083 --> 31:42.382
to see Ernesto's family.

31:42.384 --> 31:43.416
Either that or he's got

31:43.418 --> 31:44.801
another girlfriend
and he's taking

31:44.803 --> 31:47.470
extra precaution, you know?

31:48.757 --> 31:51.224
Looks like he's pulling over.

31:54.046 --> 31:57.764
These are some swanky digs.

31:59.568 --> 32:01.051
BAEZ:
You think those presents

32:01.053 --> 32:02.068
are for his girlfriend?

32:02.070 --> 32:03.770
Not a chance in hell.

32:03.772 --> 32:06.189
Looks like Ernesto's family
is moving on up.

32:06.191 --> 32:07.607
Yup.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.580
MAN: The manager should be down
in just a second.

32:13.582 --> 32:15.782
Oh, there he is, Detective.

32:16.752 --> 32:18.501
You the one in charge
of new leases?

32:18.503 --> 32:19.702
Yes.

32:19.704 --> 32:21.588
But I'm afraid we have
nothing left available.

32:21.590 --> 32:23.289
It's not for us.
A new family moved in here

32:23.291 --> 32:24.457
just yesterday.

32:24.459 --> 32:25.959
We'd like to take a look
at their lease.

32:25.961 --> 32:27.010
I'm sorry.
That's not something

32:27.012 --> 32:28.011
I'm allowed to share with you.

32:28.013 --> 32:30.213
Sure you are.

32:49.241 --> 32:51.441
(door opens)

32:56.581 --> 32:59.899
Morning, Reverend.

32:59.901 --> 33:02.235
Commissioner.

33:02.237 --> 33:05.405
You promised Detective
Reagan. Where is he?

33:06.842 --> 33:08.141
I don't know.

33:08.143 --> 33:11.878
I don't keep very close tabs
on my children.

33:17.619 --> 33:19.119
He's not coming.

33:19.121 --> 33:21.321
No.

33:22.257 --> 33:25.125
I came in his stead.

33:35.137 --> 33:36.715
My whole life,
I've dealt with cops

33:36.715 --> 33:39.116
who tell you one thing
and do another.

33:39.118 --> 33:41.718
And while I'm disappointed
that you are no different...

33:41.720 --> 33:43.387
(sighs)

33:43.389 --> 33:45.589
...I'm not surprised.

33:45.591 --> 33:48.692
That's why I always
carry my own insurance.

33:48.694 --> 33:51.328
(excited chattering)

33:51.330 --> 33:53.964
Oh...

33:53.966 --> 33:56.800
You told the press
we were meeting here.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.735
In case you pulled
a stunt like this.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.904
That was stupid.

34:02.575 --> 34:06.276
Reverend, we are walking
out of here together.

34:06.278 --> 34:09.012
Just you and I.

34:09.014 --> 34:11.081
The only choice you have

34:11.083 --> 34:14.585
is do we walk
with you in handcuffs?

34:14.587 --> 34:16.786
Whatever you think
you got on me,

34:16.789 --> 34:18.522
I can assure you,
you don't have it.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.424
Well...

34:22.127 --> 34:25.027
...I got your signature

34:25.030 --> 34:27.164
on a check and a lease

34:27.166 --> 34:30.567
that both trace back
to your shelter corporation.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.641
So I signed a lease for
an underprivileged family.

34:38.643 --> 34:39.909
There's no crime in that.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.512
Unless there were
strings attached.

34:42.514 --> 34:45.382
Like... giving
the Rodriguez family money

34:45.384 --> 34:48.985
in exchange for
Ernesto's false testimony.

34:48.987 --> 34:51.922
The DA calls that

34:51.924 --> 34:53.657
bribing a witness.

34:53.659 --> 34:57.494
That is a class D felony.

34:57.496 --> 35:00.163
Your word against my word.

35:01.567 --> 35:03.901
Actually, I think Ernesto's word

35:03.903 --> 35:05.802
is going to carry the day.

35:05.804 --> 35:08.171
You're bluffing.

35:23.088 --> 35:25.989
They asked me
to give you back your swag.

35:28.077 --> 35:30.544
And now you're going
to crucify me.

35:35.918 --> 35:37.834
No.

35:43.425 --> 35:45.976
I am going to give you
the respect

35:45.978 --> 35:49.012
that you wouldn't give my son.

35:51.133 --> 35:53.317
I'm going to give you
one last chance

35:53.319 --> 35:55.185
to honor the cloth you wear

35:55.187 --> 35:58.855
and the title
you put before your name.

36:00.743 --> 36:02.359
Why?

36:03.779 --> 36:05.996
(exhales)

36:07.032 --> 36:10.200
Shut up and start walking
before I change my mind.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.541
The police officer
kept yelling,

36:17.543 --> 36:20.711
“Put your hands up,
put your hands up!”

36:20.713 --> 36:22.045
But the bad guy
wouldn't listen.

36:22.047 --> 36:26.016
I think he was on drugs
or something.

36:26.018 --> 36:29.136
Then, all of a sudden,
he just went crazy

36:29.138 --> 36:32.272
and smashed his head
through the window.

36:32.274 --> 36:33.724
And then he just...

36:33.726 --> 36:35.392
jumped.

36:35.394 --> 36:37.060
Guess you heard already.

36:37.062 --> 36:38.528
What are you doing here?

36:38.530 --> 36:39.946
Brought you a get-well gift.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.064
You're under arrest.

36:41.066 --> 36:43.150
Just in case,
you know, you...

36:43.152 --> 36:45.118
decide you want to try
and fly again.

36:48.073 --> 36:50.407
You have the right
to remain silent.

36:50.409 --> 36:51.908
Anything you say may
be used against you

36:51.910 --> 36:53.126
in a court of law.

36:53.128 --> 36:54.411
You have the right
to an attorney.

36:54.413 --> 36:56.246
If you cannot afford
an attorney...

36:56.248 --> 36:58.415
(continues indistinctly)

37:01.086 --> 37:02.836
Me and Baez are
gonna call it a day.

37:02.838 --> 37:04.421
I need a beer, I'm
going to Fitzgerald's.

37:04.423 --> 37:05.639
You want to
come with?

37:05.641 --> 37:07.257
Another time, Reagan.

37:07.259 --> 37:09.309
You going somewhere?

37:09.311 --> 37:10.811
Siberia.

37:10.813 --> 37:12.429
You've had enough
of your own problems.

37:12.431 --> 37:14.514
I didn't want to burden
you with mine.

37:14.516 --> 37:16.767
What are you talking about,
Sarge?

37:16.769 --> 37:18.902
Kind of blew up in
the hot seat at Compstat.

37:18.904 --> 37:21.271
Oh, no.

37:21.273 --> 37:22.273
Oh, yeah.

37:22.274 --> 37:24.825
Put my foot in my mouth
big time.

37:24.827 --> 37:26.777
Just got a call
from the commissioner.

37:26.779 --> 37:28.445
He wants to see me and my box

37:28.447 --> 37:29.930
down at One PP.

37:30.916 --> 37:33.283
Well, how about
I'll talk to him.

37:33.285 --> 37:34.285
The hell you will.

37:34.286 --> 37:36.086
But I appreciate
the offer.

37:36.088 --> 37:38.004
I don't know what
to say, Sarge.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.673
I'm not dying, Reagan.

37:39.675 --> 37:40.674
I'm just gettin'
transferred.

37:40.676 --> 37:42.125
It's not the first time

37:42.127 --> 37:43.710
I been bounced
around in this job.

37:43.712 --> 37:45.219
Yeah, and it probably
won't be the last.

37:45.243 --> 37:47.297
(laughs) You know what,
Reagan?

37:47.299 --> 37:49.433
You're one of the worst
detectives I've ever had.

37:49.435 --> 37:50.467
That means a lot,

37:50.469 --> 37:52.018
coming from the worst
boss I ever had.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.386
Yeah. Take it easy, kid.

37:53.388 --> 37:55.605
I'll see you around, Sarge.

37:57.776 --> 37:58.975
(sighs)

37:58.977 --> 38:01.361
(muffled music playing)

38:01.363 --> 38:02.363
(music continues)

38:02.364 --> 38:04.481
Bull's-eye!
Man!

38:04.483 --> 38:06.116
Winner buys the next round.

38:06.118 --> 38:08.485
Oh, okay, okay.

38:10.405 --> 38:11.655
Hey, can I get three more?

38:11.657 --> 38:13.623
Thanks.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.377
What are...
what are you doing here?

38:17.379 --> 38:18.995
Looking for you.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.213
Yeah, well,
I'm off-duty.

38:20.215 --> 38:21.631
Okay, well, I only
need a minute.

38:21.633 --> 38:22.999
I just want to
apologize.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.167
For what?

38:24.169 --> 38:25.502
I misread you.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.220
I thought you
were, like...

38:27.222 --> 38:29.639
acting jealous
or something.

38:29.641 --> 38:30.841
So... my bad.

38:32.728 --> 38:34.511
Why would I be jealous?

38:34.513 --> 38:35.846
You wouldn't be.

38:35.848 --> 38:37.597
What if I was?

38:37.599 --> 38:39.816
I don't know, this...

38:39.818 --> 38:42.435
thing we have,
here, is...

38:42.437 --> 38:43.854
kind of undefined.

38:43.856 --> 38:45.272
Mm-hmm.

38:45.274 --> 38:46.940
And... and
we're flying

38:46.942 --> 38:48.692
without the instruments.
At least I am.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.944
Well, you didn't
misread me completely.

38:50.946 --> 38:52.863
I... I asked McKenna

38:52.865 --> 38:54.447
if I could ride with him

38:54.449 --> 38:58.502
before I knew he needed
a female for his decoy unit.

39:00.622 --> 39:01.671
But I'm not calling it jealousy.

39:01.673 --> 39:02.956
Neither am I.

39:02.958 --> 39:04.424
(laughs)

39:04.426 --> 39:05.458
We're good?

39:05.460 --> 39:07.210
Hey, we're good.

39:07.212 --> 39:08.428
Okay.

39:08.430 --> 39:10.013
(laughs)

39:10.015 --> 39:12.048
Um, let's shoot darts.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.850
Drink beers.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.852
Uh... another time.
I'm booked.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.221
Oh, fancy.

39:18.223 --> 39:19.890
Paging Dr. Lambchop?

39:19.892 --> 39:21.691
Come on, Eddie.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.727
It's a joke, Jamie.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.028
Remember jokes?

39:25.030 --> 39:26.446
It's just dinner.

39:26.448 --> 39:28.615
Well, you don't need
my permission.

39:29.618 --> 39:31.067
Really.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.819
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

39:32.821 --> 39:34.037
See you in the morning.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.906
Okay, I'll see <i> you</i>
in the morning.

39:35.908 --> 39:37.908
All right.

39:37.910 --> 39:39.075
Go have fun.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.745
All right.

39:51.223 --> 39:53.423
Sergeant Gormley, sir.

39:56.178 --> 39:57.561
Commissioner.

39:57.563 --> 39:59.763
(door closes)

40:01.266 --> 40:03.233
At ease, Sergeant.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.487
Put the box down,
take a load off.

40:15.948 --> 40:17.864
Sir, I...

40:17.866 --> 40:19.332
I got a big mouth, Commissioner.

40:19.334 --> 40:20.334
You know?

40:20.335 --> 40:21.618
I-I get emotional

40:21.620 --> 40:23.403
and I don't think
before I speak.

40:23.405 --> 40:26.590
You retracting what you said?

40:27.593 --> 40:29.259
Which part, sir?
What you said

40:29.261 --> 40:31.144
about liking
this department better

40:31.146 --> 40:32.479
the way it used to be.

40:32.481 --> 40:34.915
No, I stand by that.

40:35.751 --> 40:37.584
Good.

40:38.420 --> 40:39.686
Sir?

40:39.688 --> 40:42.222
I agree with exactly zero

40:42.224 --> 40:43.556
of what you said.

40:43.558 --> 40:44.758
It's cheap and easy

40:44.760 --> 40:46.159
to dress up lazy police work

40:46.161 --> 40:48.144
as some sort of

40:48.146 --> 40:50.730
Runyonesque treasure
from a bygone era.

40:50.732 --> 40:52.816
Yes, sir.

40:53.986 --> 40:55.986
But I appreciate you
having the balls

40:55.988 --> 40:58.221
to say it to my face.

41:01.944 --> 41:04.694
And I want you to come
to work for me here.

41:07.249 --> 41:10.834
Now, I know you only hold
the rank of sergeant,

41:10.836 --> 41:13.837
so civil service
law prevents me

41:13.839 --> 41:15.488
from naming you
Chief of Department.

41:15.490 --> 41:18.174
But... that is, effectively,

41:18.176 --> 41:20.010
what your role will be.

41:20.012 --> 41:22.228
Oh... I...

41:23.348 --> 41:24.848
Commissioner, I...

41:24.850 --> 41:28.685
There are 100 people
more qualified for that job.

41:28.687 --> 41:30.854
You're probably right.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.255
Then why me?

41:32.257 --> 41:35.659
Sid...

41:35.661 --> 41:39.162
when they asked me to throw
my hat in the ring for this job,

41:39.164 --> 41:41.665
I had exactly the same reaction

41:41.667 --> 41:43.333
that you're having right now.

41:45.120 --> 41:47.704
I was a cop, not a suit.

41:47.706 --> 41:49.589
I liked the street view,

41:49.591 --> 41:52.042
not the one from
high up in headquarters.

41:52.044 --> 41:54.210
(drumming fingers)

41:54.212 --> 41:56.446
So... I understand.

41:56.448 --> 41:59.249
Well, what changed your mind?

41:59.251 --> 42:02.802
A man I trusted and admired

42:02.804 --> 42:06.556
gave me a four-word answer

42:06.558 --> 42:08.224
to my question then,

42:08.226 --> 42:10.894
to your question now:

42:10.896 --> 42:14.564
Why me?
How am I in any way qualified?

42:16.451 --> 42:18.651
What he said?

42:20.405 --> 42:22.255
“You're a cop's cop.”

42:22.257 --> 42:25.375
Well... nobody calls me that.

42:25.377 --> 42:28.128
Yeah, they do.

42:28.130 --> 42:30.330
And so do I.

42:32.968 --> 42:36.219
And I need a cop's cop up here,

42:36.221 --> 42:38.555
and more every day.

42:40.258 --> 42:44.344
I need to stay connected

42:44.346 --> 42:46.596
to the rank and file

42:46.598 --> 42:48.815
and I need your help.

42:50.185 --> 42:51.601
(exhales)

42:51.603 --> 42:53.803
So can I count you in?

42:55.307 --> 42:57.340
Yes, sir.

42:58.176 --> 42:59.359
Good.

43:01.696 --> 43:05.081
So... how does Special Assistant
to the Commissioner

43:05.083 --> 43:06.833
sound to you?

43:08.587 --> 43:10.286
Awful.
