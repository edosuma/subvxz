13:28.391 --> 13:29.893
And you call yourself a trainer?

13:29.976 --> 13:31.853
I don't call myself a trainer.

13:31.936 --> 13:34.272
Well, you're a trainer
if I tell you you're one!

13:34.356 --> 13:36.649
OK, Petey, I'm a trainer.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.860
You're no trainer.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.321
The big race was only days away.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.198
And I'd already dropped a bundle

13:43.281 --> 13:45.200
training that loser of a horse,

13:45.283 --> 13:48.286
But hey, I wasn't gonna
let it get me down.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.622
[sobbing]

13:54.918 --> 13:56.503
Then I got an idea--

13:56.586 --> 13:59.255
The greatest sales gimmick of all time.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.550
You're gonna make me rich after all,

14:02.634 --> 14:04.761
you good-for-nothing loser!

14:05.011 --> 14:06.846
By throwing in a piece of Sammy

14:06.971 --> 14:08.473
with every car sold,

14:08.556 --> 14:10.809
I could sell more lemons than ever.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.063
But this car has no tires.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.565
Tires, schmires. You buy this,

14:17.649 --> 14:19.401
and I throw in a 50% share

14:19.484 --> 14:20.985
in this magnificent racehorse.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.406
Heck, you got yourself a deal.

14:27.659 --> 14:28.910
Wait'll I tell the wife!

14:30.662 --> 14:31.996
In no time,

14:32.080 --> 14:34.541
I was making money hand over hoof.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.543
Sold more horse than there was horse,

14:36.626 --> 14:38.086
but that was OK,

14:38.169 --> 14:40.255
'cause no one could collect
from a loser anyway.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.424
Of course, if Sammy won,

14:42.507 --> 14:44.426
there'd be more owners than money

14:44.509 --> 14:46.344
and I'd be in big trouble,

14:46.428 --> 14:49.264
but there was no chance of that happening.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.392
Meanwhile, the dreaded goof

14:52.475 --> 14:54.811
was makin' a last-ditch hopeless effort

14:54.894 --> 14:56.646
to get Sammy into shape.

14:58.648 --> 14:59.607
How's that feel?

15:01.192 --> 15:04.112
Sure wish I knew
how to get you to run faster.

15:07.198 --> 15:09.617
Gawrsh. No wonder you can't run.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.202
You got a big old hangnail.

15:11.286 --> 15:12.704
Don't you worry, Sammy.

15:12.787 --> 15:14.873
I'll have you good as new in a jiffy.

15:22.464 --> 15:23.715
Unh!

15:50.742 --> 15:54.079
You made it around the track
30 seconds before you even left.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.914
Must be a new record.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.916
Petey's sure gonna be happy

15:57.999 --> 16:00.460
when he hears the good news. Ah-hyuck!

16:28.863 --> 16:30.532

16:30.657 --> 16:34.202
Sometimes a guy has to stop
and sniff the money.

16:34.285 --> 16:35.870
Here he comes!

16:38.665 --> 16:40.667
Wow! What a nag!

16:40.750 --> 16:42.711
Wish I owned a thoroughbred like that.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.088
Good news, Petey, you do.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.257
Huh? What are you talking abou--

16:48.717 --> 16:49.926
Yuck!

16:50.010 --> 16:52.262
Sammy can run great now.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.139
All he had was a nail in his foot.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.057
That's sensational!

16:56.141 --> 16:58.018
That's fantastic!

16:58.727 --> 17:00.061
That's terrible.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.024
I couldn't let Sammy win that race.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.401
I knew what I had to do.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.239
A few horseshoes
in the saddle for good luck.

17:11.322 --> 17:14.951
Heh heh. Cement boots
are always in fashion.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.538

17:18.621 --> 17:21.374

a heavyweight contender.

whether you win or lose,

Who's ridin' Sammy?

18:23.228 --> 18:27.440
