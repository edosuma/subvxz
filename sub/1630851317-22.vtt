00:01.914 --> 00:04.265
Previously on
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:04.308 --> 00:06.093
Abishola calls her mother

00:06.136 --> 00:08.051
pretending to be
a spirit from beyond,

00:08.095 --> 00:12.708
guiding her with advice like,
"Get out, go home, get out."

00:14.710 --> 00:17.539
So Abishola's mother thinks
a ghost can use a phone?

00:17.582 --> 00:20.759
Why not? With unlimited minutes,
anything is possible.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.241
Your mother's mother
would be perfect.

00:24.285 --> 00:26.287
I agree.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.289
But I don't know what
my grandmother sounded like.

00:28.332 --> 00:30.726
That's your problem
with this plan?

00:32.249 --> 00:33.685
Hello?

00:38.516 --> 00:40.040
Ah-ah. Who is this?

00:43.913 --> 00:45.393
Who is this?

00:50.702 --> 00:52.400
Mummy?

00:56.752 --> 00:58.014
But I do not want to leave.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.584
I just...

01:04.803 --> 01:07.023
...do not want to go back
to that man.

01:12.855 --> 01:15.075
No, he is just my husband.

01:15.118 --> 01:17.294
The love left many years ago.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.949
All I do is cook
and clean for a man

01:19.992 --> 01:22.995
who barely looks at me.

01:23.039 --> 01:24.649
Let alone touches me.

01:29.567 --> 01:31.482
Ask her if she's
taken any lovers.

01:34.137 --> 01:36.270
Christina has left.
Now you will need

01:36.313 --> 01:38.489
to replace her with
someone qualified,

01:38.533 --> 01:41.362
who has great knowledge of
the workings of the company.

01:41.405 --> 01:42.841
That's exactly right.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.452
I usually am.

01:44.495 --> 01:45.844
Congratulations, Kofo.

01:45.888 --> 01:47.150
Excuse me?

01:47.194 --> 01:48.934
Mr. Wheeler, you said Kofo.

01:48.978 --> 01:51.502
My name is Goodwin.

01:51.546 --> 01:53.722
Yes, Goodwin.
We need you down on the floor.

01:53.765 --> 01:55.071
You're our guy.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.594
Your floor guy?

01:56.638 --> 01:59.945
Exactly.

01:59.989 --> 02:01.991
[organs playing]

02:02.034 --> 02:04.994
We got a new pastor?
What happened to the other guy?

02:05.037 --> 02:07.562
Oh, he got recruited by
a megachurch in Chicago.

02:07.605 --> 02:08.824
Good for him.

02:08.867 --> 02:11.000
No. Shame on him.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.393
We gave him everything.

02:12.436 --> 02:14.786
Then, as soon as a prettier
congregation came along,

02:14.830 --> 02:17.702
he Holy Ghosted us.[chuckles]

02:17.746 --> 02:19.791
Tunde gets very attached
to these pastors.

02:19.835 --> 02:22.011
I'm the same way
with football coaches.

02:22.054 --> 02:24.796
They all say the right stuff,
so I buy season tickets

02:24.840 --> 02:26.885
and then I wave
my stupid foam finger

02:26.929 --> 02:29.975
while the Lions lose
16 straight.

02:30.019 --> 02:32.500
We need to protect our hearts.

02:32.543 --> 02:34.154
Yeah, but then
we wouldn't love as hard.

02:34.197 --> 02:37.331
[sighs] Never change,
Bob Wheeler.

02:38.549 --> 02:40.421
FALADE:
God is among us.

02:40.464 --> 02:42.466
[hushed chatter]You all heard that, right?

02:43.772 --> 02:46.078
I can feel Him in this room.

02:48.124 --> 02:50.518
I am your new pastor
Joseph Falade.

02:50.561 --> 02:52.433
And I wanted to sit
with you to show you

02:52.476 --> 02:53.782
that I am not
a prophet,

02:53.825 --> 02:56.219
I am just a man.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.482
A man with a theology degree
from Harvard

02:58.526 --> 03:00.528
and this wonderful,
handmade suit.

03:01.877 --> 03:04.358
If you never saw it,
I never wore it.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.925
Huh. Man knows how
to make an entrance.

03:06.969 --> 03:09.537
He's wearing Air Jordans.

03:10.799 --> 03:13.149
I feel fortunate

03:13.193 --> 03:17.240
that God has chosen me
to lead this congregation.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.850
And He gave me

03:18.894 --> 03:20.330
one piece of advice.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.550
He said, "Pastor Falade,

03:22.593 --> 03:25.292
"if I can create the world
in seven days,

03:25.335 --> 03:27.990
you can get through
a service in under an hour."

03:29.383 --> 03:31.950
I feel myself
getting attached again.

03:31.994 --> 03:34.126
Yeah, this guy's taking
us to the Super Bowl.

03:34.170 --> 03:36.651
In Air Jordans.

03:36.694 --> 03:40.176
["Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola
playing]

04:01.066 --> 04:04.374
We are overjoyed to have you
at our place of worship.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.246
I hope I am here a long time.

04:06.289 --> 04:09.249
Please do not make promises
you cannot keep.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.033
Sorry.

04:11.076 --> 04:12.600
OGECHI:Pastor,

04:12.643 --> 04:14.645
this Suya is from my kitchen.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.430
I hope you enjoy.

04:16.473 --> 04:19.215
Eh, you left off
Morenike's plantains.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.000
I did not think the pastor
would want to eat anything

04:22.044 --> 04:24.960
prepared by our
nontraditional member.

04:25.003 --> 04:27.745
I thought all were welcome
in the house of the Lord.

04:27.789 --> 04:30.052
I could not agree
more, Sister Olu.

04:30.095 --> 04:33.664
Surely you also agree,
Sister Ogechi.

04:33.708 --> 04:36.319
Perhaps I am not explaining
the issue well enough.

04:36.363 --> 04:39.279
Morenike is a lesbian.

04:40.671 --> 04:43.239
I am glad to have you
in my congregation,

04:43.283 --> 04:45.110
Morenike.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.634
Thank you, Pastor.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.070
Now, if you excuse me,

04:48.113 --> 04:50.290
plantains are my favorite.

04:51.943 --> 04:53.510
In baseball,

04:53.554 --> 04:57.471
what you just did is called
a "swing and a miss."

04:57.514 --> 04:59.211
[scoffs]

05:03.041 --> 05:04.521
Morning, sister.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.044
Pastor.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.829
How did you like the service?

05:07.872 --> 05:09.918
I did not.

05:09.961 --> 05:11.528
Nice shoes.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.839
Don't worry, she didn't
like me at first either.

05:17.882 --> 05:20.145
Still kind of doesn't.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.625
Can you grab me some plantains?

05:28.023 --> 05:30.591
[sighs]
It's been 45 minutes.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.984
Ugh, it's just like Mom
to keep us waiting.

05:33.028 --> 05:35.683
Yes. What are we waiting for?

05:37.293 --> 05:38.642
Well, we probably
shouldn't tell you

05:38.686 --> 05:40.165
because she's the one
that likes

05:40.209 --> 05:41.993
to "make it rain," but...

05:42.037 --> 05:43.125
we're getting our bonus.

05:43.168 --> 05:44.996
Bonus?
Mm.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.824
But I am not family.

05:46.868 --> 05:48.391
Oh, no. The bonuses go
to upper management.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.654
Which up until this point
was only family,

05:50.698 --> 05:52.569
so I get why
you'd be confused.

05:52.613 --> 05:55.093
[laughs]:
Oh, okay.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.226
I am still confused.

05:57.269 --> 05:59.402
Douglas is no longer
in upper management,

05:59.446 --> 06:00.447
and you do not even work here.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.930
Hey, man, do you want the money
or do you want to ask questions?

06:08.846 --> 06:10.457
Who likes money?

06:10.500 --> 06:11.458
I do!
I do!

06:11.501 --> 06:13.068
Come on, it's part
of the thing.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.461
I also like the money.

06:14.504 --> 06:16.680
DOTTIE:
Well, then
step right up.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.987
Come on, baby birds,
open your little beaks.

06:19.030 --> 06:21.337
[babbles]I know it's demeaning,

06:21.381 --> 06:22.382
but it's over
before you know it.

06:22.904 --> 06:25.689
[babbles]

06:25.733 --> 06:27.952
Yum, yum, yum,
yum, yum, yum, yum.

06:27.996 --> 06:29.824
Congratulations.
You're one of us.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.216
Oluwa mi o.

06:31.260 --> 06:32.827
Wait, let me see that.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.437
Oh, it's right.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.570
That's sweet, you think
that's a lot of money.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.702
I do not deserve this.

06:38.746 --> 06:41.226
Actually, out of all of us,
you kind of do.

06:41.270 --> 06:44.882
Yeah, just think of it as a way
for the company to give back.

06:44.926 --> 06:48.364
To those of us in this room.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.322
Is it fair that so few
should benefit

06:50.366 --> 06:51.976
from the work of so many?

06:52.020 --> 06:54.326
Who are you, Fidel Castro?

06:54.370 --> 06:56.981
Kofo and I are men
of the people.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.418
You don't want your bonus?

06:58.461 --> 07:01.638
What? No. Sorry,
did I imply that?

07:03.031 --> 07:05.468
Let me explain to you a little
something about capitalism.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.557
We eat first,

07:07.601 --> 07:11.300
so we're strong and healthy
enough to run the company.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.128
But what about the workers?

07:13.171 --> 07:15.826
Well, when they see us in our
nice clothes and fancy cars,

07:15.870 --> 07:17.480
they're inspired to work harder

07:17.524 --> 07:19.613
to make their way up
from the bottom.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.092
Like I did.

07:21.136 --> 07:23.007
Look at that.

07:23.051 --> 07:24.618
The system works.

07:30.319 --> 07:31.494
Kaale,Bob.

07:31.538 --> 07:32.495
Oh, e kaale,

07:32.539 --> 07:33.888
Mama Ebun.

07:33.931 --> 07:36.673
You are reading the Bible?

07:36.717 --> 07:39.937
Well, I'm trying to. I've been
on the same page for an hour.

07:39.981 --> 07:41.330
Perhaps you would like it better
if it was written

07:41.373 --> 07:44.159
by Dean Koontz.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.248
When Pastor Falade
gave the sermon,

07:46.291 --> 07:48.511
he made it all seem exciting.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.470
Church is not supposed
to be entertaining.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.123
It is meant to frighten us.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.603
Why?

07:53.647 --> 07:56.867
Because... it is church.

07:56.911 --> 07:59.522
And God wants us afraid.

07:59.566 --> 08:02.220
All I know is,
it's nice to have a pastor

08:02.264 --> 08:04.048
who doesn't say you're going
to hell when you think

08:04.092 --> 08:06.660
some of the things in here
are screwy.

08:06.703 --> 08:09.967
Screwy?
You should be very afraid.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.534
Come on.
Explain to me why this Job guy

08:11.578 --> 08:13.362
had to get put
through the wringer.

08:13.405 --> 08:16.147
God made a wager with
Satan that Job's faith

08:16.191 --> 08:17.801
could withstand anything.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.542
What are they, golf buddies?

08:19.586 --> 08:21.979
Uh, why is God making bets
with the devil?

08:23.938 --> 08:26.941
I have often
wondered that myself.

08:26.984 --> 08:29.204
Well, then, let's stop
wondering and find out.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.423
Who are you calling?The pastor.

08:31.467 --> 08:34.383
He said "Reach out anytime,
because those who doubt

08:34.426 --> 08:36.951
are just as important
as those who believe."

08:36.994 --> 08:40.128
Eh. Also, ask him
about the story of Ruth.

08:40.171 --> 08:42.043
Who?
Just give me the phone.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.884
Hello, cousin.

08:56.927 --> 08:59.016
What are you wearing?Oh, this?

08:59.060 --> 09:01.018
As a creative executive,
I thought my look

09:01.062 --> 09:03.673
could use a trendy refresh.

09:03.717 --> 09:05.109
When did you get "a look"?

09:05.153 --> 09:06.589
When I got the hat.

09:06.633 --> 09:10.593
Doesn't it
bring everything together?

09:10.637 --> 09:11.594
Where did you buy all of this?

09:11.638 --> 09:12.813
At the Nordstrom.

09:12.856 --> 09:13.901
Nordstrom Rack?

09:15.119 --> 09:17.078
Nordstrom Regular?

09:18.383 --> 09:20.385
I may have splurged a little.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.083
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:22.126 --> 09:25.521
How can you afford
all this designer nonsense?

09:25.565 --> 09:28.524
You know how we always resented
Douglas and Christina

09:28.568 --> 09:30.526
for receiving bonuses?Yes.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.615
And they would strut in
the next day

09:32.659 --> 09:36.663
wearing overpriced jeans
and stupid-looking jackets.

09:36.706 --> 09:39.230
Oh, my God. You got a bonus?

09:40.449 --> 09:41.711
That's right, cousin.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.713
I shattered the sock ceiling.

09:43.757 --> 09:44.975
I do not understand.

09:45.019 --> 09:46.324
You do not have to.

09:46.368 --> 09:48.109
All you need to know
is that the system works.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.197
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

09:59.729 --> 10:02.732
Yes, Sister Ayomide, a
baby would be wonderful.

10:02.776 --> 10:05.517
The new pastor took
the prayer list from Ogechi

10:05.561 --> 10:07.389
and put Olu in charge.

10:07.432 --> 10:08.738
AUNTIE OLU:
Do not worry,

10:08.782 --> 10:11.611
I will make sure
everyone prays for your uterus.

10:13.264 --> 10:16.746
So many people with
so many problems.

10:16.790 --> 10:19.575
And I know about them
before anyone else.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.533
I have never seen you so happy.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.797
I do not think I have been.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.581
Is that because you're
in charge of the prayer list,

10:25.625 --> 10:27.191
or because Ogechi is not?

10:28.192 --> 10:29.629
Can it not be both?

10:30.847 --> 10:33.894
For many years, Ogechi
lorded the gossip over us.

10:33.937 --> 10:38.594
Now we will rub her nose
in it like a naughty puppy.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.422
And it's all thanks to you.

10:40.465 --> 10:41.815
What did I do?

10:41.858 --> 10:42.772
You were here.

10:42.816 --> 10:45.383
And you are queer.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.864
I see you picked up
a new slogan at the parade.

10:47.908 --> 10:50.214
Oh, it is catchy
because it rhymes.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.086
[laughter]

10:54.479 --> 10:55.524
[knocking on door]It's open.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.094
I'm sorry to bother you.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.225
Oh, it's okay. What's up?

11:01.269 --> 11:02.705
You're sure this is a good time?

11:02.749 --> 11:04.359
Yeah.
Good!

11:04.402 --> 11:06.535
Because I am very,
very angry with you.

11:06.578 --> 11:07.667
What did I do?

11:07.710 --> 11:10.495
Why did Kofo get a bonus
and I did not?

11:10.539 --> 11:12.846
Because he's the head
of marketing.

11:12.889 --> 11:16.023
He's an idiot. He wasted
his money on a stupid jacket.

11:16.066 --> 11:18.286
I can't tell people
how to spend their money.

11:18.329 --> 11:21.593
I want a stupid jacket!

11:21.637 --> 11:24.466
Believe me, I hear you,
but Kofo's a VP.

11:24.509 --> 11:25.728
The commercial
was his idea.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.774
That's what brought in
all this extra business.

11:27.817 --> 11:30.602
And who packs and ships
all the extra business?

11:30.646 --> 11:34.128
I will give you a hint:
he did not get a bonus.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.521
Goodwin, come on, you're my guy.

11:36.565 --> 11:40.221
Being your guy doesn't put
a puffy jacket on my shoulders.

11:40.264 --> 11:41.613
What are you talking about?

11:41.657 --> 11:43.615
Pretty soon you're gonna
run this whole company.

11:43.659 --> 11:44.878
When?

11:44.921 --> 11:47.532
Whenever Abishola
lets me retire.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.621
Oh, my God!

11:49.665 --> 11:52.059
Oh, I know, I know.

11:52.102 --> 11:54.757
But it's gonna happen.

11:54.801 --> 11:57.629
Look, if I can keep the faith,
so can you.

11:57.673 --> 12:01.111
[sighs]
I suppose.

12:01.155 --> 12:03.026
All right, I appreciate you
telling me how you feel.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.680
Communication's the only way
we keep this ship floating.

12:06.638 --> 12:09.859
Ready for some sushi?
Bonus lunch, baby.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.644
Ha. Hey, Goodwin.

12:12.688 --> 12:13.428
[shouts]

12:15.604 --> 12:16.779
[door closes]

12:16.823 --> 12:18.302
What's up with him?

12:24.656 --> 12:26.397
[knocks on door]Hey.

12:26.441 --> 12:27.703
What's up?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.052
Do we have any more money

12:29.096 --> 12:30.662
we can free up for bonuses?

12:30.706 --> 12:32.186
No. Books are closed.

12:32.229 --> 12:33.622
You tell Douglas,
whatever he did,

12:33.665 --> 12:35.798
he's gonna have to use
a public defender.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.887
No, i-it's Goodwin.
The guy's been busting his ass.

12:37.931 --> 12:40.063
I just want to show
a little appreciation.

12:40.107 --> 12:42.152
Now, that's a slippery slope.

12:42.196 --> 12:44.285
You start handing out bonuses,
pretty soon you're covering

12:44.328 --> 12:46.287
health care and paid vacations.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.897
Well, would that be so bad?

12:47.941 --> 12:50.291
Who are you, Fidel Castro?

12:50.334 --> 12:52.032
Well, I got to do something.

12:52.075 --> 12:53.337
He-- You know,
he's really upset.

12:53.381 --> 12:54.817
And he's worked for us
for years.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.950
And we've paid him for years.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.821
He's not just
another employee, Mom.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.780
[sighs]

13:03.043 --> 13:05.480
You're right, he's not.

13:05.523 --> 13:07.612
[grunts]
Here's what we'll do.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.181
We'll take your bonus

13:11.225 --> 13:15.185
and just distribute it
to all the underlings.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.712
I hate myself.

13:20.756 --> 13:23.280
Hey, you didn't make
the little bird noise.

13:23.324 --> 13:25.239
[babbles]

13:31.636 --> 13:34.074
My mother insisted
on cooking me lunch today.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.336
Pounded yam,

13:35.379 --> 13:38.208
okra, fried plantains.

13:38.252 --> 13:39.296
GLORIA:
Mmm.Meat pies.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.342
That was awful sweet of her.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.735
Almost too sweet. Is she dying?

13:45.476 --> 13:48.262
No, she is singing
and cooking in the kitchen.

13:48.305 --> 13:51.656
Hmm. Is anyone she hates dying?

13:51.700 --> 13:54.050
No, her enemies
are alive and well.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.312
She just seems...

13:57.662 --> 13:58.881
...happy.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.187
Well, that's great.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.492
Especially after she decided

14:01.536 --> 14:03.320
not to go home to your father.

14:03.364 --> 14:07.150
Yes, she discussed that
with the new pastor at church.

14:07.194 --> 14:09.761
She seems to be really enjoying
his spiritual guidance.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.198
Hmm.

14:11.241 --> 14:14.070
I wonder what else
he is guiding.

14:14.114 --> 14:16.594
What are you insinuating?

14:16.638 --> 14:21.338
That perhaps the pastor
has ignited her burning bush.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.036
Do not be ridiculous.

14:23.079 --> 14:25.908
My mother is a married,
Christian woman.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.910
Who has eyes.

14:27.954 --> 14:30.478
If I were not in love,
I would let the pastor sprinkle

14:30.521 --> 14:33.307
his salt and pepper beard
all over my pulpit.

14:35.570 --> 14:36.919
Will you get your mind
out the gutter?

14:36.963 --> 14:38.442
It is possible
for Abishola's mother

14:38.486 --> 14:40.053
just to be in a good place.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.358
Yes,

14:41.402 --> 14:43.099
the pastor seems to be hitting

14:43.143 --> 14:45.797
all of those good places.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.930
Kemi.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.932
Well, I know someone
who dated a certain sock man

14:49.976 --> 14:51.978
before her divorce was final.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.370
That is different.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.459
Okay, I'm putting it to bed.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.723
Like the pastor did your mama.

14:58.767 --> 14:59.724
[Kemi laughs]

14:59.768 --> 15:01.117
Gloria.

15:01.161 --> 15:02.684
I'm sorry, it was right there.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.555
And Kemi would've
said it anyway.

15:04.599 --> 15:07.471
I would not.
There is a line, Gloria.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.433
What are you doing?

15:12.476 --> 15:13.956
I'm texting the pastor.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.218
He gave you his number?

15:15.262 --> 15:18.004
He only gave me his Facebook.

15:18.047 --> 15:21.094
It's so great to actually
enjoy going to church.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.878
When we started dating,

15:22.922 --> 15:24.227
you told me you loved
going to church with me.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.969
And now with the new
pastor, I really mean it.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.232
"See you soon,

15:29.276 --> 15:30.886
smiley face, prayer hands."

15:33.236 --> 15:34.934
Hello, Tunde.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.848
Olu.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.111
Ogechi.

15:38.154 --> 15:39.677
I would ask
what is new,

15:39.721 --> 15:43.246
but you have no way of knowing.

15:43.290 --> 15:46.075
You did a very nice job
on the prayer list.

15:46.119 --> 15:47.207
Thank you.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.035
Next week you may want

15:49.078 --> 15:52.473
to put a special name on there.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.388
What are you talking about?

15:54.431 --> 15:56.999
You have not heard
about the pastor?

15:57.043 --> 16:00.350
I thought you had the
ear of the congregation.

16:00.394 --> 16:04.964
Of course I do.
What do you know?

16:05.007 --> 16:07.662
It seems the pastor
has taken a liking

16:07.705 --> 16:10.882
to a certain married member
of his flock.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.145
Who?

16:12.188 --> 16:14.799
I am not one to spread gossip.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.845
So you do not know.

16:16.888 --> 16:19.282
Not yet, but I will soon.

16:19.326 --> 16:22.024
What married woman
would be foolish enough

16:22.068 --> 16:23.983
to mess around with the pastor?

16:24.026 --> 16:26.420
Mummy, is that a new dress?

16:26.463 --> 16:27.769
It is.

16:27.812 --> 16:31.294
I like to look my best...
for God.

16:35.646 --> 16:38.388
Come on, I want to
get a good seat.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.738
♪ Lord, You are good
and Your mercy ♪

16:40.782 --> 16:43.915
♪ Endureth forever

to God's house.

17:04.806 --> 17:07.983
Today's service
will be about love.

17:08.027 --> 17:12.596
Of God and the people
that God has put into our lives.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.947
I firmly believe that
He sends us certain people

17:15.991 --> 17:18.559
at the precise moment
we need them.

17:18.602 --> 17:20.387
Perhaps it is
to bring us

17:20.430 --> 17:25.305
perspective, appreciation.

17:25.348 --> 17:29.265
Or perhaps it is just
to remind us that we are human.

17:29.309 --> 17:30.788
And though we are not perfect...

17:32.225 --> 17:34.488
...it is within
those imperfections

17:34.531 --> 17:36.403
that we find
connection.

17:37.621 --> 17:39.754
And what could be more perfect

17:39.797 --> 17:41.756
than connecting
with another soul...

17:43.149 --> 17:45.281
...and showing God
the joy

17:45.325 --> 17:47.936
of His creation?

17:47.979 --> 17:50.112
♪ All the time

18:02.429 --> 18:04.257
I did, thank you.

18:04.300 --> 18:07.086
Did you check the inside pocket?
Check the inside pocket.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.132
That's two tickets

18:10.176 --> 18:11.394
to the Lions home opener.

18:11.438 --> 18:12.961
You and I are gonna
watch them start

18:13.004 --> 18:15.616
their championship season
in person.

18:15.659 --> 18:16.834
That is very nice.

18:16.878 --> 18:20.142
And again, I'm sorry.

18:20.186 --> 18:23.363
Okay? Next year, I promise,
you're getting that bonus.

18:23.406 --> 18:24.625
If you say so.

18:24.668 --> 18:26.322
All right, I'll see you soon.

18:26.366 --> 18:27.845
Goodbye, Mr. Wheeler.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.370
We're all set.

18:30.413 --> 18:32.937
The rest of the team's
ready to meet you.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.939
I appreciate you
getting me this interview.

18:34.983 --> 18:38.117
Oh, are you kidding?
They are gonna love you.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.857
This is the right move, Goodwin.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.250
Yes, it is.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.993
Love that jacket.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.908
Oh.
[chuckles]
