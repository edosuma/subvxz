WITHOUT TAKING A SHOWER

10:06.600 --> 10:08.667
BEFORE MY ARM GETS
ALL GROSS AND DISGUSTING?

10:08.667 --> 10:10.967
IS THIS WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN TO ME

10:10.967 --> 10:12.600
WHEN MY HORMONES
KICK IN?

10:12.600 --> 10:14.800
YEAH, LIKE I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE ON MY MIND

10:14.800 --> 10:15.800
BUT GIRLS.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.800
LOOK, I GOT A LOT
OF OTHER THINGS

10:17.800 --> 10:19.000
ON MY MIND
BESIDES GIRLS.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.467
A LOT OF OTHER THINGS.
THERE'S, LIKE--

10:20.467 --> 10:23.500
GIRL! GIRL! RIGHT THERE!
RIGHT THERE!

10:23.500 --> 10:24.734
WHERE?

10:24.734 --> 10:27.000
IT'S FEENY'S NIECE.
SHE'S UNBELIEVABLE.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.367
I-- I GOTTA THINK.
I GOTTA THINK.

10:28.367 --> 10:29.934
I GOT TO TAKE HER
TO A WORLD

10:29.934 --> 10:31.233
SHE'S NEVER BEEN TO
BEFORE.

10:31.233 --> 10:32.600
DINNER. MOVIE.
MOVIE. DINNER.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.100
THIS HAS TO BE PERFECTLY
ORCHESTRATED, OR ELSE--

10:35.100 --> 10:36.567
WEASEL!

10:39.367 --> 10:42.367
OK, WEASEL,
DO YOU REMEMBER

10:42.367 --> 10:44.367
WHAT WE'VE BEEN
PRACTICING?

10:44.367 --> 10:47.200
THIS IS MY BROTHER ERIC.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.400
HE'S VERY SHY.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.033
HA HA.

10:52.033 --> 10:53.967
PERFECT. LOOK,
IN EXACTLY ONE MINUTE,

10:53.967 --> 10:55.200
I WANT YOU
TO COME OUTSIDE

10:55.200 --> 10:56.834
AND DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN
DOING AT THE MALL.

10:56.834 --> 10:58.400
HOW WILL I KNOW
WHEN IT'S A MINUTE?

11:00.600 --> 11:02.934
OK? MINUTE, DING.
MINUTE, DING.

11:02.934 --> 11:03.934
MINUTE, DING.

11:03.934 --> 11:06.400
MOVIE, DINNER.
MOVIE, DINNER.

11:07.867 --> 11:08.867
HOW YOU DOING, MR. FEENY?

11:08.867 --> 11:11.000
HOW COULD I HELP YOU
IN THE GARDEN TODAY?

11:14.900 --> 11:17.233
OH, HI. I'M ERIC.

11:17.233 --> 11:18.300
I'M JESSICA.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.667
STREP THROAT
CLEARED UP,

11:19.667 --> 11:20.934
DID IT,
MR. MATTHEWS?

11:20.934 --> 11:22.467
STREP THROAT?
A GUY LIKE ME?

11:22.467 --> 11:24.600
NO. SEE, I WORK OUT
MUCH TOO HARD

11:24.600 --> 11:26.233
TO EVER GET
STREP THROAT.

11:26.233 --> 11:28.000
SO, UH, WHERE WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO MOVE

11:28.000 --> 11:30.133
THIS ENORMOUSLY HEAVY BAG
OF FERTILIZER?

11:30.133 --> 11:32.200
I HADN'T PLANNED
ON MOVING IT AT ALL.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.467
LET ME JUST EFFORTLESSLY
TOSS IT OVER HERE, THEN.

11:35.467 --> 11:37.400
HOO-DAH!

11:42.600 --> 11:44.800
[BELL DINGS]

11:46.934 --> 11:49.300
THIS IS MY BROTHER ERIC.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.200
HE'S VERY SHY.

11:52.467 --> 11:55.767
SPEAKING
OF FERTILIZER.

11:55.767 --> 11:57.500
IS THIS
YOUR LITTLE SISTER?

11:57.500 --> 11:58.500
THAT SHE IS.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.800
I LOVE ERIC.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.000
OH, PLEASE. JESSICA,
YOU COULDN'T

12:03.000 --> 12:04.800
POSSIBLY FALL FOR
THIS LINE OF--

12:04.800 --> 12:07.000
SHE IS SO CUTE.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
AND SO
WELL-REHEARSED.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.667
ERIC'S TAKING ME
TO THE CARNIVAL TODAY.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.600
WHEN DID I SAY THAT?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.033
HA HA. LOOKS LIKE
YOUR PARROT

12:16.033 --> 12:18.934
HAS LEARNED
A FEW NEW WORDS.

12:18.934 --> 12:21.000
DO YOU WANT
TO COME WITH US?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.500
OH, WITH US.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.200
TO THE CARNIVAL
WITH US, YES.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.100
PLEASE COME WITH US.

12:26.100 --> 12:29.667
WELL, IF THAT'S OK
WITH YOU, UNCLE GEORGE.

12:29.667 --> 12:31.000
WELL, I THINK
THE POLITE THING

12:31.000 --> 12:33.100
WOULD BE TO EXTEND
AN INVITATION

12:33.100 --> 12:35.233
FOR ME TO JOIN YOU.

12:36.834 --> 12:38.600
MR. FEENY,
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME

12:38.600 --> 12:40.834
TO THE CARNIVAL WITH US?

12:42.900 --> 12:44.934
OH, THANK YOU SO VERY
MUCH FOR ASKING,

12:44.934 --> 12:49.667
BUT NO. I'D RATHER
HAVE GUM SURGERY.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.400
OK, NOW, REMEMBER
TO TAKE THOSE OUT

12:58.400 --> 13:00.567
IN A COUPLE MINUTES
SO THEY DON'T STICK.

13:00.567 --> 13:02.000
MOM, I KIND OF
GOT THE HANG OF IT

13:02.000 --> 13:03.900
IN THE LAST
4 BATCHES.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.000
IS GRANDMA LOST
OR WHAT?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.567
I DON'T KNOW, COR,
BUT, HEY,

13:07.567 --> 13:10.100
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS GONNA BAKE A CAKE NEXT.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.667
YOU WANT TO HELP ME OUT?

13:11.667 --> 13:13.600
LOOK, MOM, I KNOW
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THIS

13:13.600 --> 13:14.667
TO DISTRACT ME
AND ALL,

13:14.667 --> 13:16.500
BUT WHAT IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO GRANDMA?

13:16.500 --> 13:17.834
MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL
THE POLICE.

13:17.834 --> 13:19.000
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.200
WHY NOT?

13:20.200 --> 13:22.233
BECAUSE I'M SURE
THAT SHE'S FINE.

13:22.233 --> 13:24.100
THEN WHY ISN'T
SHE HERE YET?

13:24.100 --> 13:25.667
HONEY, I'VE KNOWN
YOUR GRANDMOTHER

13:25.667 --> 13:27.900
FOR A LONG TIME,
AND THERE'S SOMETHING

13:27.900 --> 13:29.967
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
ABOUT HER.

13:29.967 --> 13:32.000
I UNDERSTAND THAT IF
GRANDMA'S NOT HERE YET,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.200
SHE MUST HAVE
A VERY GOOD REASON.

13:40.700 --> 13:43.100
SHE'S NOT COMING,
IS SHE?

13:49.400 --> 13:50.400
I'M SORRY, COR.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.233
I KNOW THIS
IS DISAPPOINTING.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.000
EH, IT WAS JUST
A STUPID ROAD TRIP.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.600
I MEAN,
WHAT KIND OF CITY

13:56.600 --> 13:58.100
IS BALTIMORE,
ANYWAY?

13:58.100 --> 13:59.567
AN AMERICAN LEAGUE
CITY.

13:59.567 --> 14:01.400
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
CALL SHAWN?

14:01.400 --> 14:03.500
SEE IF HE WANTS
TO GO BOWLING.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.200
COOL.
I'LL DRIVE.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.200
OR I'LL DRIVE.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.133
THAT COULD WORK, TOO.

14:08.133 --> 14:10.400
I'LL CALL
MY BEST BUD SHAWN,

14:10.400 --> 14:13.033
THE ONE GUY I CAN
COUNT ON TO BE THERE.

14:13.033 --> 14:16.300
HI, MRS. HUNTER?
IT'S CORY. SHAWN AROUND?

14:16.300 --> 14:18.667
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HE'S GONE FISHING?

14:18.667 --> 14:21.400
DID YOU KNOW YOUR HUSBAND'S
CHEATING ON ME

14:21.400 --> 14:23.567
WITH SOMEONE
ELSE'S SON?

14:23.567 --> 14:26.200
YOU FORGOT
TO CALL SHAWN.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.133
GOOD-BYE, MRS. HUNTER.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.033
I FORGOT.

14:33.033 --> 14:34.100
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM

14:34.100 --> 14:35.834
YOU WEREN'T GOING
ON THE FISHING TRIP?

14:35.834 --> 14:38.000
I FORGOT.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
SO HE STILL
SHOWED UP.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I GUESS HE DIDN'T
FORGET.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.400
AND NOW HE'S OUT THERE
WITH MY DAD

14:44.400 --> 14:47.100
DRINKING ROOT BEER,
EATING POTATO CHIPS,

14:47.100 --> 14:48.467
BONDING AWAY.

14:48.467 --> 14:50.467
I MISS ONE THING
WITH MY DAD,

14:50.467 --> 14:54.967
AND HE DROPS ME FOR
THE FIRST AVAILABLE SON.

14:54.967 --> 14:56.900
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

14:56.900 --> 14:58.934
I'LL BE
IN THE TREE HOUSE.

14:58.934 --> 15:00.700
HOLD MY CALLS.

15:04.133 --> 15:08.100
<i>Morgan: ERIC IS THE BEST </i>
<i>BROTHER IN THE WHOLE WORLD. </i>

15:09.734 --> 15:11.600
THAT'S ENOUGH, MORGAN.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.300
THAT WAS SO SWEET
OF YOU

15:13.300 --> 15:15.133
TO PLAY 4 HOURS
OF SKEEBALL

15:15.133 --> 15:16.700
JUST TO WIN HER
THAT GIRAFFE.

15:16.700 --> 15:19.500
3,000 TICKETS.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.200
ERIC'S GONNA GIVE ME
HIS NEW SUNGLASSES.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.600
NO, HE'S NOT.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.100
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN REALLY
TELL A LOT ABOUT A GUY

15:26.100 --> 15:27.967
BY THE WAY
HE TREATS HIS SISTER.

15:27.967 --> 15:29.967
OH, YOU MEAN THESE.

15:29.967 --> 15:31.000
THERE YOU GO.

15:33.300 --> 15:37.300
ERIC IS SUCH
A GOOD-LOOKING BOY.

15:37.300 --> 15:38.500
YEAH, THANKS.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.600
ARE WE ALL DONE
FOR THE DAY?

15:40.600 --> 15:42.800
YES, WE'RE DONE.
BYE-BYE.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.100
SHE'S ADORABLE.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.767
SHE'S NOT
THE ONLY ONE.

15:49.767 --> 15:52.867
WHO'S GRAZIELLA
TERZIANA?

15:52.867 --> 15:54.233
WHAT?

15:54.233 --> 15:57.800
HER NAME, IT'S WRITTEN
ON YOUR ARM.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.800
UH, THAT--

15:59.800 --> 16:02.200
I CAN'T STOP EVERY GIRL
WHO WANTS TO SIGN MY BODY.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.767
OH, MR. CHARMING.

16:04.767 --> 16:06.767
I COULD LOAN YOU
A PEN.

16:06.767 --> 16:08.500
AND SMART, TOO,

16:08.500 --> 16:11.300
USING HIS LITTLE SISTER
AS DATE BAIT LIKE THAT.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.867
THAT OBVIOUS, HUH?

16:12.867 --> 16:14.467
OH, YEAH. HEH.

16:14.467 --> 16:15.767
BIG MISTAKE?

16:15.767 --> 16:16.867
DID I SAY THAT?

16:16.867 --> 16:18.800
SO I DIDN'T HAVE
TO WORK SO HARD.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.000
WHO SAID YOU HAD
TO WORK AT ALL?

16:39.000 --> 16:42.300
NICE NIGHT, HUH?

16:42.300 --> 16:43.400
YEAH.

16:43.400 --> 16:46.934
WELL, WE'RE JUST,
UH, PASSING THROUGH.

16:46.934 --> 16:49.500
GOOD. PASS.

16:50.667 --> 16:54.500
ERIC, THE LIPMASTER.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.133
YEAH. SURE.

16:57.133 --> 16:59.100
LOOK, ANYBODY ELSE,
OR ARE WE ALL DONE HERE?

16:59.100 --> 17:01.400
EVERYONE HAVE
A GREAT DAY WITHOUT ME?

17:01.400 --> 17:02.800
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN UP THERE?

17:02.800 --> 17:06.033
LONG ENOUGH TO WATCH YOU
SWAP SPIT WITH A FEENY.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.000
WELL, I'D SAY THE MOOD
IS SUFFICIENTLY KILLED,

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
WOULDN'T YOU?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.100
DEAD AND BURIED.

17:15.100 --> 17:16.934
I THINK MY LITTLE SISTER'S
BUSY TOMORROW,

17:16.934 --> 17:19.200
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.934
I'LL BRING
THE PEN.

17:20.934 --> 17:22.300
GOOD NIGHT.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.734
EVERYONE. HA HA.

17:27.100 --> 17:31.000
SHE'S RELATED
TO FEENY?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.200
NIECE.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.033
NICE.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.300
NICE?
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.900
THAT'S THE MOST
INCREDIBLE GIRL

17:38.900 --> 17:39.900
I EVER KISSED.

17:39.900 --> 17:41.600
WHICH PUTS HER
AT THE TOP

17:41.600 --> 17:44.734
OF A LIST
OF WHAT, 2?

17:46.200 --> 17:50.233
LOOK, MAKING OUT IS
NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT.

17:50.233 --> 17:52.300
OOH...

17:54.700 --> 17:56.800
WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK
FROM BALTIMORE SO EARLY?

17:56.800 --> 17:58.233
I DIDN'T GO
TO BALTIMORE.

17:58.233 --> 17:59.233
WHY NOT?

17:59.233 --> 18:00.500
'CAUSE I STAYED
HERE ALL DAY

18:00.500 --> 18:01.667
'CAUSE GRANDMA
DUMPED ME

18:01.667 --> 18:03.367
WHILE MY BEST FRIEND
WAS OUT

18:03.367 --> 18:04.567
STEALING MY DAD.

18:04.567 --> 18:05.600
OH, GROW UP.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.700
I WASN'T STEALING
YOUR FATHER.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.300
GOOD NIGHT, SHAWN.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.934
NIGHT, DAD.

18:12.500 --> 18:13.834
SO GRANDMA
NEVER SHOWED, HUH?

18:13.834 --> 18:14.834
NAH, SHE DIDN'T.

18:14.834 --> 18:15.834
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT?

18:15.834 --> 18:16.834
DOESN'T REALLY SEEM

18:16.834 --> 18:18.100
LIKE THERE'S MUCH
TO TALK ABOUT.

18:18.100 --> 18:19.900
HOO, BOY,
ARE YOU WRONG.

18:19.900 --> 18:21.567
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

18:21.567 --> 18:23.800
I'M HUNGRY. SHAWN ATE
EVERYTHING ON THE BOAT

18:23.800 --> 18:25.133
EXCEPT THE WORMS.

18:25.133 --> 18:27.500
HE USUALLY
LIKES THOSE.

18:30.100 --> 18:34.700
UH, I CAN HIGHLY
RECOMMEND THE MUFFINS.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.667
THESE ARE
A LITTLE DRY.

18:42.667 --> 18:45.400
GREAT. I COOK
AND I SLAVE,

18:45.400 --> 18:47.000
AND THIS IS
THE THANKS I GET.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.100
YOU MADE THESE?

18:48.100 --> 18:49.700
I DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE TO DO

18:49.700 --> 18:51.200
'CAUSE GRANDMA
DIDN'T SHOW UP.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.500
I'VE BEEN THERE.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.400
WAIT A MINUTE.
SHE DID THIS TO YOU?

18:54.400 --> 18:56.967
HEY, PICK A CATEGORY.
YOU LIKE SPORTS?

18:56.967 --> 18:59.200
BIRTHDAYS?
YOU LIKE ROCKET SHIPS?

18:59.200 --> 19:01.033
I'LL TAKE
ROCKET SHIPS.

19:01.033 --> 19:03.500
ALL RIGHT. UM...
ONE DAY MY CLASS

19:03.500 --> 19:05.000
WAS SUPPOSED TO GO
ON THIS FIELD TRIP

19:05.000 --> 19:06.567
TO THE FRANKLIN
MUSEUM OF SCIENCE

19:06.567 --> 19:08.967
TO SEE THE
"MAN IN SPACE" EXHIBIT.

19:08.967 --> 19:09.967
COOL.

19:09.967 --> 19:10.967
YEAH, IT WOULD'VE BEEN,

19:10.967 --> 19:12.967
EXCEPT THAT GRANDMA
FORGOT TO RETURN

19:12.967 --> 19:16.200
THE PERMISSION SLIP,
SO I DIDN'T GET TO GO.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.867
I BEEN THERE.

19:17.867 --> 19:19.400
YEAH, ME, TOO,
AND I FELT

19:19.400 --> 19:21.100
JUST THE WAY
YOU'RE FEELING NOW.

19:21.100 --> 19:22.100
DID YOU HATE HER?

19:22.100 --> 19:23.233
WELL, NO.

19:23.233 --> 19:24.834
IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO HATE HER, CORY,

19:24.834 --> 19:26.500
'CAUSE A COUPLE OF MONTHS
LATER, SHE WOKE ME UP

19:26.500 --> 19:28.600
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
SHE BUNDLES ME UP,

19:28.600 --> 19:30.133
THROWS ME
IN THE WINNEBAGO,

19:30.133 --> 19:32.667
WE DRIVE FOR 2 DAYS
AND 2 NIGHTS.

19:32.667 --> 19:33.967
WHERE'D SHE TAKE YOU?

19:33.967 --> 19:35.200
CAPE CANAVERAL.

19:35.200 --> 19:38.300
MERCURY 3.
FIRST AMERICAN IN SPACE.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.300
MY CLASSMATES
ARE BACK IN PHILADELPHIA

19:40.300 --> 19:43.000
LOOKING AT IT ON A LITTLE
BLACK-AND-WHITE TV.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.133
I'M THERE FEELING THE HEAT

19:45.133 --> 19:47.200
FROM THE ROCKET
ON MY FACE.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.500
GRANDMA TOOK YOU ALL
THE WAY TO CAPE CANAVERAL?

19:49.500 --> 19:52.033
SEE, GRANDMA DOESN'T SHOW
LOVE LIKE OTHER PEOPLE DO,

19:52.033 --> 19:54.133
BUT SHE LOVES YOU
NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK.

19:54.133 --> 19:56.400
SHE JUST SHOWS LOVE
IN HER OWN WAY.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.500
AND WHEN SHE'S WITH YOU,
SHE WANTS IT TO BE SO SPECIAL

19:59.500 --> 20:01.200
THAT YOU'LL
ALWAYS REMEMBER.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.900
I ALWAYS DO
REMEMBER.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.367
YEAH, SO DO I.

20:04.367 --> 20:05.600
WHEN THAT ROCKET
TOOK OFF

20:05.600 --> 20:08.400
AND THE SMILE ON MY FACE
WAS A MILE WIDE

20:08.400 --> 20:11.467
AND ALL OF AMERICA WAS
WATCHING THEIR LITTLE TV SET,

20:11.467 --> 20:16.000
I REMEMBER THAT MY MOTHER
WAS WATCHING ME.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.600
[CAR HORN HONKS
<i>LA CUCARACHA] </i>

20:22.200 --> 20:24.133
GUESS WHO.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.000
HI, MOM.
HI, ALAN.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.900
YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE,
WILL YOU?

20:30.900 --> 20:33.033
WOULD YOU WANT
ME TO?

20:33.033 --> 20:35.934
NOPE.
HA HA HA.

20:35.934 --> 20:38.100
HEY, KIDDO, LOOK,
I KNOW WE WERE SUPPOSED

20:38.100 --> 20:39.400
TO GO
TO BALTIMORE TODAY,

20:39.400 --> 20:40.934
BUT YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE
WHAT CAME UP.

20:40.934 --> 20:42.200
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
GRANDMA.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.734
OH, SURE IT DOES.

20:43.734 --> 20:45.300
I KNOW YOU WANTED
TO TAKE ME.

20:45.300 --> 20:46.300
I-I REALLY DID.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.700
DID I TELL YOU THAT
MY CAL RIPKEN CARD

20:48.700 --> 20:50.000
WAS MY FAVORITE ONE?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.200
IT IS?

20:51.200 --> 20:52.834
YEAH, AND HIS SIGNATURE
MIGHT'VE MESSED IT UP,

20:52.834 --> 20:55.934
JUST LIKE THAT LAMBORGHINI GIRL
MESSED UP ERIC'S ARM.

20:55.934 --> 20:59.867
THE NEXT TIME MY CONVOY
SWINGS BY HERE,

20:59.867 --> 21:01.033
YOU AND I ARE GONNA DO

21:01.033 --> 21:02.834
SOMETHING
REALLY SPECIAL.

21:02.834 --> 21:04.600
I CAN'T WAIT.

21:04.600 --> 21:07.500
HI, GRANDMA, COR.
DAD, I'VE BEEN IN MY ROOM

21:07.500 --> 21:09.000
FOR THE LAST
20 MINUTES, OK?

21:10.567 --> 21:12.200
ALAN, I WOULD
APPRECIATE IT

21:12.200 --> 21:14.867
IF YOU KEPT YOUR SON
AND HIS HORMONES

21:14.867 --> 21:16.800
INSIDE THE HOUSE...

21:16.800 --> 21:19.400
AT LEAST UNTIL
MY NIECE LEAVES.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.200
WHY, GEORGE,
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

21:21.200 --> 21:22.734
ERIC'S BEEN UP
IN HIS ROOM FOR...

21:22.734 --> 21:24.500
20...
MINUTES.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.934
EXCUSE ME.

21:25.934 --> 21:27.600
I WILL NOT BE
JERKED AROUND.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.033
OH, WELL, EXCUSE ME,

21:29.033 --> 21:31.133
BUT AS THE MATRIARCH
OF THIS FAMILY,

21:31.133 --> 21:33.100
NOT TO MENTION
A CARD-CARRYING MEMBER

21:33.100 --> 21:35.100
OF THE KIWANIS CLUB,
I CAN PERSONALLY VOUCH

21:35.100 --> 21:36.567
FOR THE FACT
THAT THIS FINE YOUNG MAN

21:36.567 --> 21:39.200
HAS BEEN UP IN HIS ROOM
FOR THE PAST 20 MINUTES.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.200
AND EXCUSE ME,
MISS KIWANIS,

21:41.200 --> 21:43.300
BUT HOW COULD YOU
KNOW THAT

21:43.300 --> 21:45.200
WHEN I JUST SAW
YOU PULL UP

21:45.200 --> 21:46.300
IN YOUR WINNEBAGO

21:46.300 --> 21:50.100
AND RUN OVER MY MUMS
NOT 40 SECONDS AGO?

21:50.100 --> 21:52.200
WHO IS THIS GUY?

21:52.200 --> 21:53.300
MY TEACHER.

21:53.300 --> 21:55.500
DOES HE GIVE YOU
STRAIGHT As?

21:55.500 --> 21:56.600
NO.

21:56.600 --> 21:57.800
AND WHY NOT?

21:57.800 --> 22:00.200
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO THE BOY?

22:02.300 --> 22:04.033
OK, TEACH,
YOU JUST BETTER KISS

22:04.033 --> 22:06.200
THE REST OF THOSE MUMS
GOODBYE.

22:08.667 --> 22:09.734
WHO IS THAT WOMAN?

22:09.734 --> 22:10.767
MY GRANDMA.

22:10.767 --> 22:12.600
DON'T YOU JUST
LOVE HER?

22:12.600 --> 22:15.600
NO, I DON'T.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
WELL, I DO.

22:28.100 --> 22:31.400
CAL RIPKEN JR.,
ROOKIE YEAR.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.033
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D ACTUALLY GET

22:33.033 --> 22:34.367
TO HOLD ONE
OF THESE THINGS.

22:34.367 --> 22:36.800
MY GRANDMA PICKED IT UP
AT THE SWAP MEET

22:36.800 --> 22:38.667
FOR 7 BUCKS.

22:38.667 --> 22:41.600
7 BUCKS
IN DOG YEARS.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.934
THIS BABY'S
WORTH 150, EASY.

22:44.934 --> 22:46.734
IT IS?
YEAH.

22:46.734 --> 22:49.600
BOY, YOUR GRANDMA
MUST REALLY LOVE YOU.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.600
YEAH.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.367
OR ELSE SHE SHOT
A MAN IN RENO

22:53.367 --> 22:56.400
JUST TO WATCH HIM DIE.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.900
YOU'RE KIDDING...
RIGHT?

22:58.900 --> 23:01.500
I'M NOT SURE.
