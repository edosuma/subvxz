00:01.794 --> 00:03.211
Distinguished guests, friends,

00:03.253 --> 00:04.505
members of the press...

00:04.546 --> 00:07.758
when the Fish Defense League

00:04.546 --> 00:07.758
told me

00:07.800 --> 00:09.301
that the dam on our property

00:09.343 --> 00:12.638
was blocking the endangered

00:09.343 --> 00:12.638
silverback trout

00:12.680 --> 00:17.518
from its natural breeding

00:12.680 --> 00:17.518
grounds, I was glad to help.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.687
And so today,

00:19.728 --> 00:22.648
we are going to blow up

00:19.728 --> 00:22.648
this evil dam.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.108
Afterwards, we will have

00:22.690 --> 00:25.108
a nice, light lunch

00:25.150 --> 00:26.485
provided by the Grotto,

00:26.527 --> 00:29.780
a friend of fish

00:26.527 --> 00:29.780
and the business traveler.

00:30.906 --> 00:32.199
Here we go!

00:33.951 --> 00:35.076
That's weird.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.370
From here, the dynamite looks

00:36.411 --> 00:38.706
a lot like

00:36.411 --> 00:38.706
a picnic cooler.

00:43.126 --> 00:45.086
I am starting to think

00:45.128 --> 00:47.756
that that is

00:45.128 --> 00:47.756
a picnic cooler.

Mom and Dad let Dewey pick

01:24.418 --> 01:26.712
where we went to dinner tonight.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.005
I can't decide if it's

01:28.047 --> 01:30.131
supposed to be

01:28.047 --> 01:30.131
a punishment for us

01:30.173 --> 01:31.050
or a treat for him.

01:31.090 --> 01:33.092
Probably a little bit of both.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.263
How's the chicken

01:34.177 --> 01:36.263
supposed to know you like her

LOIS:

01:38.057 --> 01:40.642
Boys! Food's here!

01:41.936 --> 01:45.188
So, Dewey, are you having

01:41.936 --> 01:45.188
a good time?

01:45.230 --> 01:46.273
I actually am.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.943
Oh, wait.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.151
Why?

01:50.193 --> 01:51.570
He's dying!

01:51.612 --> 01:53.154
We have to make sure you come up

01:51.612 --> 01:53.154
with a really good wish.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.032
Reese, he isn't dying.

01:55.074 --> 01:59.160
If he were dying,

01:55.074 --> 01:59.160
we'd at least spring

01:55.074 --> 01:59.160
for Red Lobster.

01:59.995 --> 02:01.080
Mrs. Welsh, your counselor,

02:01.121 --> 02:03.665
said that she'd like

02:01.121 --> 02:03.665
you to take an I.Q. test.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.876
What?!

02:03.707 --> 02:05.876
Malcolm, do not poison

02:03.707 --> 02:05.876
your brother.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.335
He is an entirely different

02:05.918 --> 02:07.335
person than you are and

02:07.377 --> 02:09.797
he is not automatically going

02:07.377 --> 02:09.797
to have the same experience!

02:10.464 --> 02:12.758
It's just a little test, honey.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.842
Mom, don't do this.

02:13.884 --> 02:14.843
I lost all my friends

02:14.885 --> 02:16.470
when I went

02:14.885 --> 02:16.470
into the Krelboyne class.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.638
Everyone hated us!

02:17.679 --> 02:19.848
You had every advantage

02:17.679 --> 02:19.848
in that class.

02:19.890 --> 02:20.891
You had computers,

02:20.933 --> 02:23.268
an electron microscope,

02:20.933 --> 02:23.268
a seismograph...

02:23.310 --> 02:24.853
Which is why they hated us!

02:24.895 --> 02:26.229
Malcolm, we all know

02:24.895 --> 02:26.229
there's something weird

It's cheaper

You're great.

quite clear on that.

"Bee is to hive as

Four... years ago.

How do you... remember?

I just do.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.050
And it's a good thing,

04:16.673 --> 04:18.050

04:24.305 --> 04:26.307
The tests are designed

04:24.305 --> 04:26.307
to catch that.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.185
We have to give exactly

04:26.349 --> 04:28.185

this'll work?

06:16.459 --> 06:17.585
Hey, if there's

06:16.459 --> 06:17.585
one thing I know,

06:17.627 --> 06:21.340
Reese's answers will not get him

06:17.627 --> 06:21.340
into the Krelboyne class.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.384
I'm emotionally disturbed?!

06:25.426 --> 06:27.470
Oh, we don't use those terms.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.805
This isn't about labeling.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.682
A blue folder with

06:28.847 --> 06:30.682
an asterisk next to your name

06:30.724 --> 06:34.519
just means that you get

06:30.724 --> 06:34.519
a little more special help

06:30.724 --> 06:34.519
than other kids.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.146
Hey, Bill.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.189
This one's named Dewey.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.440
BOY:

06:37.231 --> 06:39.440
Dewey, Dewey, Dewey.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.317
Okay.

06:40.359 --> 06:41.818
There's no yelling,

06:40.359 --> 06:41.818
no kicking,

06:41.860 --> 06:44.363
no hitting, no physical touching

06:41.860 --> 06:44.363
of any kind.

06:44.403 --> 06:47.908
You are allowed to cry,

06:44.403 --> 06:47.908
if you do it quietly.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.535
Find a seat

06:47.949 --> 06:50.535
wherever you can.

06:50.577 --> 06:55.374
(boy imitating revving engine)

06:59.169 --> 07:00.461
(imitates revving engine)

07:00.503 --> 07:02.214
Vroom, vroom.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.468
Hey, could you

07:04.966 --> 07:07.468
scratch my nose?

07:07.510 --> 07:08.678
What's that?

07:08.720 --> 07:10.138
Oh.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.182
You can ignore the sign.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.526
They put you

07:22.150 --> 07:23.526
in with the Buseys?!

07:23.568 --> 07:24.611
Yeah, it's real interesting.

07:24.652 --> 07:27.447
Today, we learned about

07:24.652 --> 07:27.447
our greatest enemies,

07:27.488 --> 07:29.741
Mr. Matches

07:27.488 --> 07:29.741
and Mr. Talk-Out-Of-Turn.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.492
Oh, and I also got

07:29.783 --> 07:31.492
to see a crane

07:31.534 --> 07:35.080
lower a flight simulator

07:31.534 --> 07:35.080
into the Krelboyne class.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.623
Oh, my God!

07:35.122 --> 07:36.623
Does Mom know?

07:36.664 --> 07:38.750
You're still alive, so no.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.877
I'm so sorry.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.877
I swear I'll fix this.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.170
Just don't tell Mom.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.256
Please, please don't tell Mom.

07:44.298 --> 07:47.592
You know, I like the begging,

07:44.298 --> 07:47.592
but it needs something.

07:49.261 --> 07:52.680
Better, but... still not enough.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.849
(car pulls into driveway)

07:54.891 --> 07:56.810
Dewey, this is my paycheck.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.270
There's $98.00 here.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.105
I will give you

07:58.312 --> 08:00.105
everything I make

08:00.147 --> 08:01.522
until you get

08:00.147 --> 08:01.522
out of that class.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.402
Hi, boys.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.402
Hey.

08:05.444 --> 08:06.445
Oh, Dewey, did

08:05.444 --> 08:06.445
Mrs. Welsh tell you

08:06.486 --> 08:07.654
when they'd get

08:06.486 --> 08:07.654
your test results?

08:07.695 --> 08:08.780
Oh, I got 'em.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.531
And he's in the Krelboyne class,

08:10.573 --> 08:12.117
just like you wanted.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.534
I hope you're happy.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.120
You've ruined his life!

08:15.162 --> 08:16.455
Come on, Dewey.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.710
Well, I'm not an escape artist.

08:25.588 --> 08:29.550
BILL:

08:25.588 --> 08:29.550
Okay. Now that Chad

08:25.588 --> 08:29.550
has apologized

08:29.592 --> 08:32.553
to Lester, Max, Zoe, Phoebe,

08:29.592 --> 08:32.553
Garth, Michelle,

08:32.595 --> 08:33.847
and Linda,

08:33.888 --> 08:36.808
we can now try,

08:33.888 --> 08:36.808
once again,

08:36.850 --> 08:38.143
to read  Polar Express

08:38.185 --> 08:41.521
in as normal a way as we

08:38.185 --> 08:41.521
can possibly manage.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.106

Indoor muffler!

08:44.732 --> 08:47.235
(revving softly)

08:47.277 --> 08:49.904
Okay, I want you

08:47.277 --> 08:49.904
to open this book

08:49.946 --> 08:52.324
to page seven and read.

08:52.657 --> 08:53.658
No motorcycle.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.286
Just say exactly

08:53.700 --> 08:56.286
what's on the page.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.578
No motorcycle.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.332
No motorcycle.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.543
No motorcycle.

09:06.129 --> 09:10.091
No motorcycle.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.592
(screaming)

09:11.634 --> 09:14.054
Okay, okay.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.054
That's enough reading.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.556
Why don't we try

09:14.095 --> 09:16.556
some more quiet time?

09:19.017 --> 09:20.477
Why did you do that?

09:20.519 --> 09:22.603
When did you read that book?

09:22.645 --> 09:23.897
Three years ago.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.149
Me, too. All of us did.

09:26.191 --> 09:30.070
They treat us like we're

09:26.191 --> 09:30.070
stupid instead of just weird.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.613
This place is slowly killing me.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.701
Oh, look.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.701
We made it to recess.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.416
Jeffy, you're not an arm's

09:39.704 --> 09:42.416
length from Carrie.

09:42.457 --> 09:45.210
Why don't we have recess

09:42.457 --> 09:45.210
with the other kids?

09:45.252 --> 09:47.628
We make them too sad.

Mrs. Welsh?

10:16.491 --> 10:18.326
May I help you?

10:18.368 --> 10:19.744
I'm Malcolm, Dewey's brother.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.829
I have to talk to you

10:19.786 --> 10:21.829
about the test Dewey took.

10:21.871 --> 10:24.124
I'm afraid I can only discuss

10:21.871 --> 10:24.124
that with his parents.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.333
See, that's just it.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.919
I can get in a lot of trouble

10:25.375 --> 10:27.919
for coming here,

10:27.961 --> 10:30.671
but I have to tell you why his

10:27.961 --> 10:30.671
test came out the way it did.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.674
Our mom has a substance

10:30.713 --> 10:33.674
abuse problem,

10:33.716 --> 10:37.137
and she had a huge relapse

10:33.716 --> 10:37.137
the morning he took the test.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.513
Oh, my God.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.932
Yeah, which is why she can't

10:38.555 --> 10:40.932
find out I came here.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.559
I don't want to say

10:40.974 --> 10:42.559
she's dangerous

10:42.601 --> 10:46.813
because she's, you know, my mom,

10:42.601 --> 10:46.813
and I love her.

10:46.854 --> 10:50.358
Wow. Well, I can tell you

10:46.854 --> 10:50.358
really care about your family.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.735
It's been really hard.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.237
Let's see what

10:52.777 --> 10:54.237
I can do. Okay?

10:54.279 --> 10:55.947
And I don't think we have to

10:54.279 --> 10:55.947
bother your mom with this.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.949
Thanks.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.700
I'll do everything

10:57.991 --> 10:59.700
through your dad.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.244
Thanks for the heads up.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.705
Wow. Ten messages

11:02.245 --> 11:04.705
from Dewey's counselor.

11:04.747 --> 11:05.624
Maybe I should...

11:05.665 --> 11:08.418
Practice so we can win

11:05.665 --> 11:08.418
this thing?

11:08.460 --> 11:09.169
Right.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.171
Five, six, seven, eight!

11:11.212 --> 11:13.298
One, two, three,

11:11.212 --> 11:13.298
and four

11:13.340 --> 11:15.716
and boogie shake,

11:13.340 --> 11:15.716
boogie shake,

11:15.758 --> 11:17.260
and slide and slide,

11:17.302 --> 11:19.678
These jazz shoes have really

11:17.302 --> 11:19.678
helped my kick turns.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.599
Totally worth

11:20.514 --> 11:22.599
150 bucks.

11:22.641 --> 11:23.517
Hal?

11:23.558 --> 11:24.851
Uh-oh.

11:23.558 --> 11:24.851
Here comes Yoko.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.227
It's 5:00

11:24.892 --> 11:26.227
in the morning.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.021
You've been up all night.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.481
Honey, I know you think

11:28.062 --> 11:29.481
this is silly

11:29.523 --> 11:31.399
and that I've just gone off

11:29.523 --> 11:31.399
the deep end again,

11:31.441 --> 11:33.776
but this isn't like

11:31.441 --> 11:33.776
the other times.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.487
I have a gift, Lois,

11:35.529 --> 11:37.989
and it would be wrong for me

11:35.529 --> 11:37.989
to turn my back on that.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.699
Right. I see we've

11:38.031 --> 11:40.699
entered phase two.

11:40.741 --> 11:44.204
Which is fine, as long

11:40.741 --> 11:44.204
as you follow the rules.

11:44.245 --> 11:47.123
You have to go

11:44.245 --> 11:47.123
to work.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.416
You have to eat.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.543
You cannot involve

11:48.458 --> 11:49.543
the children.

11:49.584 --> 11:51.085
And you're freezing

11:49.584 --> 11:51.085
the joint account.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.420
Did it last week.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.673
Good night, Fred.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.673
Ginger.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.759
I thought it was Fred

11:57.175 --> 11:58.759
and Barney.

11:58.801 --> 12:05.266
BILL:

11:58.801 --> 12:05.266
Take your tissue and carefully

11:58.801 --> 12:05.266
twist it to make a flower.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.227
Then you make a bouquet

12:07.268 --> 12:10.438
by carefully stacking them.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.273
Go slow. This isn't a race.

12:12.315 --> 12:15.443
Why do all our art projects

12:12.315 --> 12:15.443
use tissues?

12:15.485 --> 12:17.778
Because tissues are soft

12:15.485 --> 12:17.778
and nontoxic.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.448
This way no one gets hurt,

12:17.820 --> 12:20.448
and no one sues the school.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.243
This program can't handle

12:20.490 --> 12:23.243
another lawsuit, Dewey.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.870
I only get paid for four days

12:23.284 --> 12:25.870
a week as it is.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.038
But it's ridiculous.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.789
We have to do math

12:27.080 --> 12:28.789
without pencils.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.750
We have to do history

12:28.831 --> 12:31.750
without hard-cover books.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.752
Can't we at least

12:31.792 --> 12:33.752
have some art supplies?

12:33.794 --> 12:36.464
Art supplies mean scissors.

12:33.794 --> 12:36.464
Theymean paste.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.091
These children stab

12:36.506 --> 12:38.091
with scissors.

12:38.132 --> 12:38.966
They eat paste.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.302
Some of them tried

12:39.008 --> 12:41.302
to eat scissors.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.846
This one tried

12:41.344 --> 12:43.846
to stab with paste.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.349
Teachers are supposed

12:43.888 --> 12:46.349
to help their students.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.476
Maybe you wouldn't be so unhappy

12:46.391 --> 12:48.476
all the time

12:48.518 --> 12:49.810
if you tried a little harder.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.398
Look, Dewey, you're not going

12:49.852 --> 12:53.398
to make it

12:53.440 --> 12:55.567
through the year

12:53.440 --> 12:55.567
with that attitude.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.818
You just have to take

12:55.609 --> 12:57.818
all your hopes and dreams

12:57.860 --> 13:00.280
and let them die.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.781
Then maybe you won't end up

13:00.321 --> 13:02.781
staring at a clock

13:02.823 --> 13:04.825
at 4:00 in the morning wishing

13:02.823 --> 13:04.825
you had kissed more ass

13:04.867 --> 13:06.827
in grad school.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.997
Thanks for trying.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.750
(imitating revving engine)

13:11.790 --> 13:14.919
I swear, if you can get

13:11.790 --> 13:14.919
the paste,

13:14.961 --> 13:17.464
I'll stab him for you.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.722
...and then he was chopped up

13:22.927 --> 13:25.722
and eaten by wolves,

13:25.764 --> 13:28.725
because that's what happens

13:25.764 --> 13:28.725
to babies who pull hair.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.602
(knocking)

13:31.894 --> 13:33.229
What are you doing here?

13:33.271 --> 13:34.897
Malcolm, who is it?

13:33.271 --> 13:34.897
Don't worry.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.857
I have a master's degree

13:34.939 --> 13:36.857
in conflict resolution.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.778
Can I help you?

13:36.899 --> 13:39.778
I'm Mrs. Welsh,

13:39.818 --> 13:41.529
First of all,

13:39.818 --> 13:41.529
let me just tell you

13:41.571 --> 13:43.782
how much I admire

13:41.571 --> 13:43.782
your courage.

13:43.822 --> 13:44.991
Thank you.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.117
Your son Malcolm

13:45.032 --> 13:46.117
came to see me...

13:46.159 --> 13:47.410
No, I didn't!

13:47.452 --> 13:48.411
Let me do what I do.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.163
He was worried

13:48.453 --> 13:50.163
that Dewey

13:50.204 --> 13:51.872
had been placed

13:50.204 --> 13:51.872
in the wrong class.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.167
Malcolm, how dare you?

13:54.208 --> 13:55.543
You made your feelings

13:54.208 --> 13:55.543
very clear,

13:55.585 --> 13:57.671
but you had no right

13:55.585 --> 13:57.671
to do something like that!

13:57.712 --> 13:59.756
Well, the thing is I did look

13:57.712 --> 13:59.756
through Dewey's records,

13:59.798 --> 14:01.132
and his test results

13:59.798 --> 14:01.132
don't match up

14:01.174 --> 14:02.342
with his classroom

14:01.174 --> 14:02.342
performance.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.884
There may be grounds

14:02.383 --> 14:03.884
to retest him.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.387
Oh, no. Absolutely not!

14:06.429 --> 14:08.389
You are not going

14:06.429 --> 14:08.389
to take this away from my son.

14:08.431 --> 14:09.557
He deserves to be in that class.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.559
He needs to be in that class.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.186

14:11.601 --> 14:13.186

14:18.483 --> 14:19.942
Oh, you'll see out of control

My imaginary friends are right!

18:25.939 --> 18:27.941
I  am  a genius!

18:28.524 --> 18:30.150
So basically,

18:28.524 --> 18:30.150
what it means

18:30.192 --> 18:31.611
is that the sound waves

18:31.652 --> 18:33.153
from a motorcycle move away

18:33.195 --> 18:36.074
from it at the same speed

18:33.195 --> 18:36.074
in all directions.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.617
But if it's coming

18:36.115 --> 18:37.617
towards you,

18:37.658 --> 18:40.160
then the sound waves

18:37.658 --> 18:40.160
get stacked closer

18:40.202 --> 18:41.495
and closer together,

18:41.537 --> 18:42.872
so the frequency goes up

18:41.537 --> 18:42.872
