00:11.596 --> 00:16.643
<i>NARRATOR". Atop this skyscraper, the gala
opening of a new super-swank restaurant...</i>

00:16.809 --> 00:19.646
<i>...run by an old super-crooked friend.</i>

00:19.854 --> 00:22.232
Delighted, Mrs. Van Swank.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.985
So charming of you
to honor my humble establishment.

00:26.236 --> 00:29.781
This way, please. Quack, quack, quack.

00:34.118 --> 00:36.871
It's so sweet of you
to ask all of us here as your guests.

00:37.038 --> 00:39.541
Ha, ha. Guests of the house, I'm glad to say.

00:39.791 --> 00:41.668
Warden Crichton felt we should be here.

00:41.834 --> 00:45.255
He was so pleased with Penguin
having opened this beautiful restaurant.

00:45.463 --> 00:46.798
Hi, my friends.

00:46.965 --> 00:49.300
- Are you enjoying yourselves?
-We certainly are, Penguin.

00:49.467 --> 00:52.178
- Ah.
-Most inspiring, Penguin.

00:52.387 --> 00:55.306
To think that you've mastered
this art of haute cuisine...

00:55.515 --> 00:58.268
...in the kitchens
of the Gotham City State Penitentiary.

00:58.476 --> 01:00.979
It certainly proves
that almost nothing is impossible.

01:01.187 --> 01:03.773
Well, thank you, Mr. Wayne.
Thank you kindly.

01:03.982 --> 01:05.900
- I have one small question, though.
-Oh?

01:06.067 --> 01:08.653
- The strange system for ordering food.
-Strange?

01:08.820 --> 01:11.823
Yes.
Instead of giving the waiter our orders...

01:12.031 --> 01:16.160
...we're required to write them out
on individual slips of paper.

01:16.327 --> 01:18.580
I was struck by the oddness of that myself.

01:18.830 --> 01:21.207
- Why?
- Oh, well, efficiency, Mr. Wayne. That's all.

01:21.374 --> 01:22.417
- Oh.
-Efficiency.

01:22.584 --> 01:25.545
- Ha, ha.
-Pretty fishy, if you ask me.

01:25.795 --> 01:30.675
Chief O'Hara, what kind of way is that
to address our generous host?

01:30.883 --> 01:32.885
All right, I apologize.

01:33.094 --> 01:35.013
Accepted, my dear chief.

01:35.179 --> 01:37.432
Oh, my sweet lady.

01:37.682 --> 01:40.184
I do hope that you're enjoying your dinner.

01:40.351 --> 01:42.854
Oh, yes, everything is lovely.

01:43.062 --> 01:44.188
Well, thank you.

01:44.355 --> 01:48.526
In that case, I'll just-- Thank you very much.
Quack, quack, quack.

01:48.693 --> 01:53.615
Oh, merciful heavens to Betsy,
my diamond bracelet is gone.

01:53.865 --> 01:55.700
Hold it, you crooked bird.

01:55.908 --> 01:57.076
Chief O'Hara.

01:57.327 --> 01:59.537
All right, open your mitt, Penguin.

01:59.704 --> 02:01.080
I saw you lift it.

02:01.331 --> 02:04.459
Why, you dratted fellow, unhand me.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.047
Good gravy, what a stupid, clumsy crime.

02:09.213 --> 02:11.049
Speak up, Penguin. What do you say?

02:11.257 --> 02:13.968
- I say faugh.
-What?

02:14.218 --> 02:16.638
Looks like I'm caught with my feathers down,
doesn't it?

02:16.888 --> 02:20.642
Chief O'Hara, place Penguin under arrest
for grand larceny, first degree.

02:20.892 --> 02:23.394
- Yes, sir. A great pleasure, sir.
- Wait a minute.

02:23.603 --> 02:24.979
Wait, Bruce? What for?

02:25.229 --> 02:28.066
Sure and we caught the thieving bird
in the act, didn't we?

02:28.274 --> 02:30.151
True, Chief O'Hara.

02:30.401 --> 02:33.237
However, there's something strange
about all this.

02:33.446 --> 02:38.868
So strange that wouldn't it be perhaps wise
to consult Batman?

02:39.077 --> 02:40.161
Batman?

02:40.411 --> 02:43.456
On a simple case like this, Bruce?

02:43.665 --> 02:47.418
Bruce is right. The simpler a case looks,
the more tricky it's apt to be.

02:47.627 --> 02:49.379
Faugh, who needs Batman?

02:49.587 --> 02:50.880
Take me to prison.

02:51.089 --> 02:52.298
That does it.

02:52.507 --> 02:56.344
When this pompous, waddling master
of foul play all but asks to be arrested...

02:56.511 --> 02:59.681
Heh. Thanks for the advice.
I'll call Batman at once.

02:59.931 --> 03:02.767
I think I saw a phone booth in the lobby.

03:04.310 --> 03:07.772
Excuse me, Aunt Harriet,
I have a call of my own to make.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:31.129 --> 03:33.631
Yeah, police switchboard?
This is Commissioner Gordon.

03:33.798 --> 03:36.217
Please put this through
on the hotline Bat-phone.

03:43.641 --> 03:45.935
- Alfred, where are you?
-I'm in the Batcave, sir.

03:46.144 --> 03:47.979
I was dusting the anticrime computer.

03:48.187 --> 03:51.816
In seconds the Batphone will be flashing.
Switch it into this line, will you?

03:52.024 --> 03:53.067
Very good, sir.

03:54.444 --> 03:56.154
Ah, there it flashes now.

03:58.573 --> 04:01.033
- Ah, hello?
<i>- I'll</i> summon him at once, sir.

04:03.161 --> 04:04.495
We're in luck. Batman's at home.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.581
Ah, wonderful.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.253
- Hello.
-Yes, commissioner?

04:12.503 --> 04:15.339
A strange and baffling crime
at The Penguin's Nest restaurant.

04:15.548 --> 04:19.510
- Can you meet me here at once?
-It may take a little longer than that.

04:19.719 --> 04:22.388
Well, don't worry, Batman. I'll wait for you.

04:24.390 --> 04:25.767
- He's on his way.
-Splendid.

04:26.017 --> 04:29.270
And so are we. I've just lost all my appetite.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.063
Do you mind, Bruce?

04:31.272 --> 04:34.233
Of course not, my dear. Whatever you say.

04:34.859 --> 04:36.068
- Good night.
- Good night.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.487
- Good night.
- Good night.

04:37.653 --> 04:39.697
- Good night, Mrs. Cooper.
- Good night.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.204
Irritating. Most irritating.

06:10.413 --> 06:15.126
Just when I'd learned to fly straight,
destroyed again.

06:19.589 --> 06:20.923
What's your story, Penguin?

06:21.132 --> 06:25.303
Well, I was the victim
of an irresistible criminal impulse.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.639
So that's his defense, temporary insanity.

06:28.806 --> 06:31.225
Faugh! Me, plead insanity? Quack.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.894
I wouldn't dream of it.

06:33.102 --> 06:35.646
Grand larceny, first degree.
Another trip up the river.

06:35.813 --> 06:37.815
Well, you can't win them all, Batman.

06:37.982 --> 06:40.735
That's how the iceberg crumbles.

06:40.943 --> 06:43.321
Stranger and stranger.

06:43.946 --> 06:47.950
Tell me, commissioner, what kind of business
was this restaurant doing?

06:48.159 --> 06:51.412
Fabulous. Virtually every millionaire
in Gotham City was here tonight.

06:51.621 --> 06:52.788
I checked the books.

06:52.997 --> 06:56.417
The average tab
came to 87 bucks per person.

06:56.626 --> 06:59.420
Not counting drinks
and the hundred smackers' cover charge.

06:59.629 --> 07:00.796
Holy straitjacket.

07:01.005 --> 07:04.008
Imagine throwing away a business
worth hundreds of thousands...

07:04.216 --> 07:06.010
...for one diamond bracelet.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.846
- Incredible.
-indeed.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.140
- Tell me, Penguin...
- Hmm?

07:11.307 --> 07:14.852
...who are your associates
in this curious venture?

07:18.606 --> 07:19.774
Yes, sir.

07:19.982 --> 07:21.525
My associates, Batman.

07:21.734 --> 07:26.364
Reading from right to left,
Cordy Blue, my chef.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.324
Hey, I know that bird.

07:28.532 --> 07:31.327
He used to be chief hash-slinger
at the state pen.

07:31.535 --> 07:34.038
Matey Dee, my head waiter.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.331
Astonishing.

07:35.539 --> 07:38.876
That fellow did a term up the river
as Warden Crichton's personal valet.

07:39.043 --> 07:44.215
And last but not least, Chickadee,
my hat chick and cigarette girl.

07:44.382 --> 07:48.678
Not to mention notorious female bootlegger
of untaxed cigars.

07:48.886 --> 07:51.555
- Ahem.
-An unsavory crew.

07:51.806 --> 07:54.517
Well, they're all out on perfectly legal parole.

07:54.725 --> 07:56.519
Do you wanna see their papers, Batman?

07:56.727 --> 07:58.229
No, thank you, Penguin.

07:58.396 --> 08:00.272
You may resume your normal duties.

08:02.817 --> 08:05.903
- Commissioner, Chief O'Hara, Robin.
-Yeah.

08:10.074 --> 08:12.535
You make something of this enigma,
Batman?

08:12.743 --> 08:15.246
It sticks out like Penguin's nose.

08:15.413 --> 08:19.583
For some sinister reason,
that pompous bird wants to be arrested.

08:19.792 --> 08:21.085
- Good heavens.
-But why?

08:21.293 --> 08:26.549
I can't imagine, but it's obviously his ploy,
stealing that bracelet under your very eyes.

08:26.757 --> 08:29.010
And if Penguin wants to be arrested...

08:29.218 --> 08:30.720
Precisely, Robin.

08:30.928 --> 08:34.515
The way to foil his plot
is to do just the opposite.

08:34.724 --> 08:37.934
Are you certain you know what you're doing,
Batman?

08:38.102 --> 08:40.438
We'll soon find out, commissioner.

08:40.604 --> 08:41.772
Watch.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.113
I'm growing restless.

08:49.321 --> 08:51.782
Where is that dratted paddy wagon?

08:51.949 --> 08:53.409
It's not coming, Penguin.

08:53.617 --> 08:55.286
What?

08:55.953 --> 08:57.955
We've had a conference, Penguin.

08:58.205 --> 09:02.710
We have decided
that your impulsive theft of that bauble...

09:02.918 --> 09:06.881
...was merely a case of post-prison nerves.

09:07.089 --> 09:09.550
Do you mean
that you're not gonna pinch me?

09:09.759 --> 09:12.970
Even the rottenest bird
deserves another chance.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.640
Great quivering jellyfish, what an outrage.

09:16.849 --> 09:18.601
What did I tell you?

09:18.976 --> 09:22.855
You can't let a felonious felon like me
fly free.

09:23.064 --> 09:24.899
It's what we're doing, Penguin.

09:25.483 --> 09:29.320
Oh, it's impossible. It's monstrous. it's--

09:34.617 --> 09:35.868
Okay, Penguin.

09:36.452 --> 09:38.579
- Heh, heh.
-No, chief, no!

09:38.788 --> 09:42.666
- What?
-He was merely baiting us. Don't swallow.

09:42.917 --> 09:45.628
Have a heart, chief.
Penguin didn't mean any harm.

09:45.836 --> 09:48.756
Didn't mean any harm?

09:48.964 --> 09:51.467
Hitting a police commissioner
in the puss with a pie?

09:51.675 --> 09:56.514
No, no, he was simply overwrought
with astonishment.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.974
Anyone could make the same mistake.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.976
Right, commissioner?

10:01.185 --> 10:04.605
Of course. Anything you say, Batman.

10:05.189 --> 10:06.524
Good night, Penguin.

10:06.690 --> 10:11.695
I recommend a cup of warm cocoa
to calm your post-prison nerves.

10:11.862 --> 10:12.905
Come on.

10:13.072 --> 10:18.702
Aw! Faugh! Phooey! Fudgy!

10:19.620 --> 10:22.623
I'd like to grab that bird by the neck.

10:22.832 --> 10:24.041
I'd like to pluck him.

10:24.291 --> 10:28.170
I'd like to prod him all the way to the pen
with a pointed stick and--

10:28.379 --> 10:30.214
Toss the rest of this pie in after him.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.175
Easy, gentlemen. Control your emotions.

10:33.384 --> 10:37.888
Batman's right. We mustn't make a move
until we've found out what Penguin's plot is.

10:38.055 --> 10:40.141
Which we're going to attempt to do
right now.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.393
What do you have in mind, Batman?

10:42.560 --> 10:45.813
His criminal headquarters
must be in the adjoining kitchen.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.315
We'll descend to the ground floor
via elevator...

10:48.524 --> 10:51.569
...and make our way up the outside wall
with our Batropes.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.487
Terrific. Let's go.

10:53.696 --> 10:56.407
Well, that pestilential pair!

10:56.574 --> 11:00.161
The one time in my life
that I wanted to get arrested...

11:00.369 --> 11:02.454
...and they pop in and block it.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.749
Down, Pengy-poopsie. Don't lose your cool.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.544
Faugh, I'm the Penguin.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.088
How can a Penguin lose his cool?

11:11.255 --> 11:14.216
All right, you've got those food orders,
Matey Dee?

11:14.425 --> 11:17.094
- Right here, sir.
-Quack, quack, quack.

11:17.261 --> 11:20.931
Oh, how disgustingly frustrating.

11:21.098 --> 11:25.102
Here in my hands
the raw material for criminal millions...

11:25.269 --> 11:27.688
...and I can't get into prison to process it.

11:27.897 --> 11:30.608
How about driving around
and parking in front of fire plugs?

11:30.858 --> 11:34.695
- Spitting on a couple of sidewalks?
-Faugh, that's fiddlesticks.

11:34.904 --> 11:38.949
If a bird can't get arrested
by potting a police commissioner with a pie...

11:39.116 --> 11:41.285
...what chance with those piddling ploys?

11:41.493 --> 11:44.455
Pengy, look, the handle of your umbrella...

11:44.622 --> 11:46.498
...it's flashing.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.960
Heh, heh. So it is. So it is.

11:52.421 --> 11:55.966
- What's it mean, boss?
-it's my brand-new bat detector.

11:56.133 --> 11:59.637
And it means there are bats in this belfry.

11:59.803 --> 12:04.600
Our plot is back on the track.
Our plot is back on the track.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.395
It's sure a shame, Batman.

12:08.604 --> 12:11.023
A restaurant with such terrific chow...

12:11.232 --> 12:14.318
...turning out to be a mere front
for some criminal scheme.

12:14.526 --> 12:15.778
Look at it this way, Robin.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.906
That hundred-dollar cover charge
is pretty stiff.

12:19.114 --> 12:23.244
Penguin's terrific chow is hardly
within the budget of the average worker.

12:23.452 --> 12:25.746
Gosh, yes, you're right, Batman.

12:25.955 --> 12:30.167
All the needy people in the world,
the hungry children.

12:30.334 --> 12:32.336
Good thinking, Robin.

12:34.797 --> 12:38.759
Oh, it's you, Batman.

12:39.051 --> 12:41.303
Gave me quite a start.

12:41.512 --> 12:43.764
Yes, citizen, you may return
to your harpsichord.

12:43.973 --> 12:45.474
We're on official business.

12:45.683 --> 12:46.809
Oh.

12:52.356 --> 12:54.149
They're coming up to our level now.

12:54.358 --> 12:55.943
Heading for the window, no doubt.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.030
Vicious little eavesdropper.

13:00.197 --> 13:04.285
I'll give them something to drop about.
Heh, heh.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.828
What's the plan, Batman?

13:06.036 --> 13:08.330
Routine crime detection.

13:08.539 --> 13:12.376
We'll listen in via Bat-microphone
and peer through this window.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.295
You're a traitor, Mr. Blue.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.130
You've betrayed us all.

13:16.338 --> 13:17.881
Death to traitors.

13:20.843 --> 13:21.885
Great Scott!

13:22.094 --> 13:24.513
Holy firing squad!

13:27.016 --> 13:30.561
Drat it. Caught red-handed, ain't I?

13:30.728 --> 13:33.897
Yes and no, Penguin.

13:34.106 --> 13:35.482
Yes and no?

13:42.031 --> 13:43.407
Yike!

13:45.743 --> 13:46.910
Holy blank cartridge.

13:47.119 --> 13:50.247
Precisely, Robin. A sham.

13:50.414 --> 13:51.665
How the heck did you know?

13:51.874 --> 13:54.501
I observed the recoil of that umbrella gun.

13:54.710 --> 13:58.881
Obviously, its angular momentum
was inadequate for the mass of a real bullet.

13:59.089 --> 14:04.261
So, Penguin, another crude attempt
to buy a ticket to the lockup, eh?

14:04.428 --> 14:07.348
Faugh, I don't know what you're talking about,
Batman.

14:07.556 --> 14:09.683
Don't worry, you've succeeded.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.728
You're arresting me?

14:12.936 --> 14:16.440
As a duly deputized agent of the law...

14:17.524 --> 14:19.777
...that's what I hereby do.

14:28.452 --> 14:32.956
It's outrageous.
I'll sue you, you piteous upstarts.

14:33.207 --> 14:36.251
You have absolutely no right
to do this to me.

14:36.460 --> 14:37.586
How dare you?

14:37.795 --> 14:44.593
How dare you confine a super-criminal
of my ilk in this petty city jail all night?

14:44.802 --> 14:47.471
-It's all you rate, Penguin.
-What?

14:47.721 --> 14:53.143
This tawdry, penny-ante pokey
on a charge of simulated murder?

14:54.353 --> 14:56.146
Simulated murder?

14:56.355 --> 14:59.358
Heh. I guess we forgot to tell him.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.236
You're in here
for violating the sanitary code.

15:02.444 --> 15:05.614
- What?
-Article 69 B.

15:05.823 --> 15:10.119
Forbidding the discharge of umbrella guns
in the kitchen of a licensed restaurant.

15:10.327 --> 15:12.287
Call your lawyer. Have him look it up.

15:13.747 --> 15:14.915
Good day, Penguin.

15:15.124 --> 15:20.254
Reflect on your petty sins,
you bush-league bird.

15:23.340 --> 15:27.428
Incarcerated for a violation
of the sanitary code?

15:27.636 --> 15:28.762
It's impossible.

15:28.971 --> 15:31.515
Why, it's unconstitutional.

15:37.271 --> 15:38.313
Here we are.

15:38.522 --> 15:41.692
Layout of the state pen,
maximum-security wing.

15:41.942 --> 15:44.027
That's Penguin's permanently reserved cell.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.612
Number P-1.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.781
With a connecting door to cell Q-7.

15:47.990 --> 15:51.994
Now to find out what criminal
presently occupies Q-7.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.423
"Cell Q-7.

16:04.631 --> 16:10.179
Presently occupied by Barney F. Baxter,
alias Ballpoint Baxter."

16:10.387 --> 16:14.683
Yes, Ballpoint. That ugly master of forgery.

16:15.309 --> 16:17.227
My hunch is right, Robin.

16:17.436 --> 16:19.188
It all fits like my glove.

16:19.396 --> 16:20.647
How so, Batman?

16:20.856 --> 16:24.860
Remember that curious mode of ordering
in Penguin's restaurant?

16:25.068 --> 16:28.739
Sure. Instead of telling the waiter
what you wanted, you had to write it out.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.199
Precisely, Robin.

16:30.407 --> 16:36.580
Thus furnishing Penguin with a perfect sample
of his patron's handwriting, signature and all.

16:36.830 --> 16:37.998
I get it.

16:38.207 --> 16:40.959
Penguin planned to take those samples
to the state pen...

16:41.168 --> 16:43.378
...and have Ballpoint transfer them
to checks.

16:43.545 --> 16:44.588
Right, Robin.

16:44.838 --> 16:50.260
One of the most brilliant forgery schemes
we've ever uncovered.

16:50.469 --> 16:56.475
But, gosh, how would Ballpoint lay his mitts
on blank check forms in the state penitentiary?

16:56.683 --> 16:59.895
Good question, Robin.
Let's call Warden Crichton and find out.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.785
Warden Crichton,
Gotham State Penitentiary.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.913
Sorry to wake you
from your routine afternoon nap, warden.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.582
Batman here with a small but vital question.

17:20.790 --> 17:21.959
Yes. Yes, of course.

17:22.125 --> 17:25.295
Among your current guests
is one Ballpoint Baxter.

17:25.503 --> 17:29.383
Is there any way this creature
could get his hands on blank check forms?

17:29.591 --> 17:33.136
No trouble at all. He'd merely have
to order them from the prison print shop.

17:33.303 --> 17:37.933
You mean prisoners can order
blank check forms from the print shop?

17:38.100 --> 17:39.142
Certainly, Batman.

17:39.393 --> 17:42.479
The idea is to teach them
how to handle their personal finances...

17:42.646 --> 17:44.314
...in a responsible fashion...

17:44.523 --> 17:47.609
...once they leave these grim walls
and rejoin society.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.152
I see. Another first.

17:49.403 --> 17:52.573
Another
of your advanced penological techniques.

17:52.781 --> 17:53.907
Right.

17:54.116 --> 17:56.785
Why? You think it's unwise, Batman?

17:57.327 --> 17:58.829
I don't know.

17:59.037 --> 18:02.291
I've always had boundless admiration
for your efforts, warden...

18:02.499 --> 18:07.421
...but sometimes I just don't know.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.256
Good bye.

18:11.633 --> 18:12.926
Well, that settles it.

18:13.135 --> 18:14.595
We know the Penguin's plot.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.096
But how to foil it?

18:16.305 --> 18:20.684
Simple. Give him enough rope,
send him up the river as he wishes.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.687
Sure.
Let him get in touch with Ballpoint Baxter.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.648
- And after he does...
-Wham! We pounce.

18:26.857 --> 18:32.446
Let's race back to the city,
set our trusty trap for Penguin.

18:37.826 --> 18:42.456
<i>NARRATOR". But even as the Dynamic Duo
speeds from the fabulous Batcave...</i>

18:42.664 --> 18:47.294
<i>...tricky Penguin is making plans of his own
with his tiny Penguin radio...</i>

18:47.502 --> 18:50.631
<i>...which was unluckily overlooked
when the bird was searched.</i>

18:50.797 --> 18:52.341
Quack. Over and out.

18:55.636 --> 18:59.806
<i>NARRATOR". Mere minutes later,
in the city jail downstairs...</i>

18:59.973 --> 19:02.476
<i>...in the police headquarters building...</i>

19:02.643 --> 19:05.395
- What do you want?
- Amalgamated Caterers.

19:05.562 --> 19:09.024
We're delivering this special tricky treat
for prisoner Penguin.

19:09.232 --> 19:13.987
It's his birthday, officer.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.405
Don't tell me.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.074
Hacksaw pie.

19:17.240 --> 19:22.829
This tricky treat snack was authorized
by Chief O'Hara himself, sir.

19:28.752 --> 19:30.212
Officer Hoffman, back door.

19:30.420 --> 19:34.341
Would you have the chief step down here
a moment, please? Thank you.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.349
Do you know what this is?

19:42.974 --> 19:44.851
This is an electrical metal detector.

19:45.060 --> 19:50.774
And if there's a hacksaw blade in this pie,
this metal detector is going to detect it.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.110
How fascinating.

19:58.407 --> 19:59.449
Wow.

19:59.616 --> 20:03.078
High-voltage battery pie sure worked
the way the Penguin said it would.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.288
Quick, get his keys. Chickadee, get his gun.

20:13.630 --> 20:19.010
The fools, imagining that a mere city jail
could hold a slippery bird like me.

20:23.306 --> 20:26.852
- Curious. That door was open.
-Maybe Penguin has plans...

20:27.018 --> 20:29.479
...for a jail transfer of his own.
-Let's find out, shall we?

20:31.815 --> 20:34.025
- Just as I planned.
-You planned?

20:34.234 --> 20:35.318
Forget it, Penguin.

20:35.527 --> 20:38.822
The best-laid plans of birds and men
gang aft agley.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.533
Plans of bats too, Batman.

20:42.492 --> 20:44.828
You're deluded, murderous girl.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.913
Will these crooks never learn?

20:47.122 --> 20:49.166
At them, gentlemen! At them!

20:50.542 --> 20:53.295
Get him! Yeah, get him! Yeah!

20:53.503 --> 20:55.797
Die, you fool. You hear me?

21:10.979 --> 21:12.814
Oh, you idiot, over there.

21:12.981 --> 21:14.858
What are you doing, sleeping?

21:17.277 --> 21:20.363
After him, you fink! After him!

21:31.666 --> 21:35.086
Stand still, you red-breasted roadrunner.

21:41.384 --> 21:43.595
What the devil? Unh!

21:44.971 --> 21:49.142
Dynamic Duo, look.

21:50.393 --> 21:52.687
Good work, Chickadee.

21:56.566 --> 21:59.194
The fiends,
they'll use the chief as a hostage.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.321
Farewell, Batman and Boy Wonder.

22:01.530 --> 22:03.198
Adieu for now.

22:03.406 --> 22:06.535
- Forward, feckless flatfoot.
-Never.

22:06.743 --> 22:09.663
Go with them, chief.
Don't resist. They're killers.

22:09.871 --> 22:11.540
It's your only hope.

22:15.627 --> 22:19.214
Upstairs, Commissioner Gordon's office.
Quickly, Robin.

22:22.926 --> 22:24.928
Yes? Put him through.

22:25.178 --> 22:27.013
It's Penguin.

22:27.764 --> 22:32.435
<i>Tell Batman
the old abandoned Navy recreation center.</i>

22:32.686 --> 22:34.229
<i>The swimming pool.</i>

22:34.437 --> 22:38.692
<i>It's his last chance to see Chief O'Hara alive.</i>

22:38.900 --> 22:40.569
We're on our way, Penguin.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.445
Just one question.

22:42.654 --> 22:44.531
Do you promise a fair duel?

22:44.739 --> 22:48.743
Robin and I against you
and your mangy mob?

22:48.952 --> 22:51.204
<i>Of course, Batman. Of course.</i>

22:51.413 --> 22:54.624
<i>Fair play is Penguin's middle name.</i>

22:58.044 --> 23:00.964
Well, now, you know my amusing scheme?

23:01.172 --> 23:04.092
- They come in, we shoot.
-Chickadee?

23:04.301 --> 23:07.596
I push that trunk containing Chief O'Hara
into the pool.

23:09.347 --> 23:12.434
Let me out of this infernal hamper, you devils!

23:12.642 --> 23:14.728
What's the idea? Let me out!

23:16.730 --> 23:21.610
And as the Dynamic Duo's
bullet-riddled bodies hit the drink...

23:21.818 --> 23:25.989
...I'll turn on the high-voltage switch,
heh-heh-heh...

23:26.197 --> 23:32.245
...at 100,000 volts,
electrifying the entire swimming pool.

23:38.335 --> 23:40.003
The Batmobile.

23:40.253 --> 23:41.963
The bat's last flight.

23:42.172 --> 23:43.924
All right, men, to your stations.

23:51.848 --> 23:53.683
Chickadee, to the waterslide.
