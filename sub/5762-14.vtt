00:24.420 --> 00:26.230
Did I tell you what's going on with ned?

00:26.230 --> 00:30.040
He brings this girl home,and I barely have time to approve of her or not,

00:30.040 --> 00:32.820
and then he says,you know what,mom,she's not the girl for me.

00:32.820 --> 00:36.050
And I'm like,ned,I thought I liked that girl.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.010
What?

00:44.750 --> 00:47.230
Oh,my god.

00:50.290 --> 00:51.750
Rick: Graffiti here in grandview?

00:51.750 --> 00:52.830
Are you sure there was graffiti?

00:52.830 --> 00:54.500
I mean,was the handwriting nice,at least?

00:54.500 --> 00:55.570
Ok,this isn't funny,

00:55.570 --> 00:57.470
and we're not just talking about some random tagger.

00:57.470 --> 00:58.490
It was meant for me.

00:58.490 --> 00:59.400
Well,I wouldn't worry about it.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.970
It's probably some stupid prank,some kids.

01:00.970 --> 01:02.730
Why would they write that?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.930
All right,have you been on and shame the devil lately?

01:04.930 --> 01:07.520
-What?
-Justin yates' obnoxious blog?

01:07.520 --> 01:08.230
No.

01:08.230 --> 01:12.890
Well,there's been some chatter lately,a bunch of posts,about you.

01:13.910 --> 01:18.280
A person of interest in grandview who claims to have more than a passing acquaintance with the dead.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.030
I've heard about a store in town where really weird stuff happens.

01:21.030 --> 01:22.420
I can't believe this.

01:22.420 --> 01:23.930
It's like he's trying to out me.

01:23.930 --> 01:25.160
How long has this been happening?

01:25.160 --> 01:26.180
I don't know,a week.

01:26.180 --> 01:27.660
But don't even pay attention to it.

01:27.660 --> 01:28.940
You should see what they write about me.

01:28.940 --> 01:30.840
He knows things,thanks to your careful

01:30.840 --> 01:32.650
and thorough notes that you let him steal,

01:32.650 --> 01:34.720
he knows everything about me.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.740
Do you have any idea what my life is going to be like if this gets out?

01:37.740 --> 01:38.820
I didn't let him steal my notes.

01:38.820 --> 01:40.580
He stole my notes 'cause he's clever,he's cunning.

01:40.580 --> 01:42.210
He lives on campus,right?

01:42.210 --> 01:44.050
Take me to him.

01:45.730 --> 01:48.170
You put this out there,justin.

01:48.170 --> 01:49.910
I thought you were going to keep my secret.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.350
Why are you trying to hurt me?

01:51.350 --> 01:53.660
I'm not trying to hurt anybody.

01:53.660 --> 01:55.450
People come to my blog for the truth.

01:55.450 --> 01:56.980
Oh,yeah,'cause you're all about the truth.

01:56.980 --> 01:59.040
Look,this is a bad time,ok?

01:59.040 --> 02:00.420
Hey,justin,this might be a good time to tell you

02:00.420 --> 02:04.020
about a fascinating new invention called the hanger.

02:04.020 --> 02:06.260
Besides,according to the professor's notes,

02:06.260 --> 02:07.910
you've helped a lot of people.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.479
You've affected a lot of people.

02:09.479 --> 02:11.290
I mean,how long do you expect to keep this a secret?

02:11.290 --> 02:14.260
Exactly,justin,I have helped a lot of people.

02:14.260 --> 02:17.520
And if this gets out,my life is going to be turned upside down.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.030
Rick: Interesting choice of words.

02:20.030 --> 02:22.780
Hey,give that to me.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.170
Look,I came to you a long time ago with a lot of questions,

02:29.170 --> 02:31.500
and you gave me nothing,and now you want my help?

02:31.500 --> 02:32.570
I don't want anything from you.

02:32.570 --> 02:35.120
I just want to be left alone.

02:35.240 --> 02:38.160
That may not be possible.

03:50.710 --> 03:51.900
It could be anybody.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.670
I mean,that's what's so scary.

03:53.670 --> 03:55.060
Someone who saw me doing something,

03:55.060 --> 03:57.760
or someone who talked to one of the families that I've helped.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.380
This is what I always dreaded--

03:59.380 --> 04:01.390
some nutjob out there decides you're a witch.

04:01.390 --> 04:03.650
Can't the justin fellow trace this on his blog?

04:03.650 --> 04:05.590
Well,he's not being very cooperative.

04:05.590 --> 04:07.230
I'll make him be cooperative.

04:07.230 --> 04:10.610
Look,this may not even have anything to do with justin or his blog.

04:10.610 --> 04:11.690
I mean,last time I talked to him,

04:11.690 --> 04:13.180
he said that he would keep my secret.

04:13.180 --> 04:14.500
And you believe him?

04:14.500 --> 04:15.400
Yes.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.269
Because he wants something in return.

04:17.269 --> 04:18.209
Uh,what would that be?

04:18.209 --> 04:19.660
I don't know,he hasn't told me yet.

04:19.660 --> 04:23.880
All right,so meanwhile,you're in the bulls-eye of some potential lunatic,

04:23.880 --> 04:26.720
could be someone you see everyday,a customer,a dealer.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.490
Or payne could be...

04:28.490 --> 04:31.750
right and it could just be a school kid prank.

04:31.750 --> 04:35.700
Look,I know you don't need to hear this,

04:35.910 --> 04:38.800
but maybe we need to talk to the police.

04:39.140 --> 04:42.040
Look,this could just be a one-time thing.

04:42.040 --> 04:42.800
Ok?

04:42.800 --> 04:46.890
Let's not panic.It'll probably never even happen again.

04:57.750 --> 05:00.720
How many people do you think saw that before we got here?

05:00.720 --> 05:03.970
We should just paint something new on the window every night,

05:03.970 --> 05:06.150
like,sacks fifth avenue.

05:06.150 --> 05:07.560
This is really scaring me.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.850
I mean,what if whoever or whatever is doing this,

05:09.850 --> 05:11.580
decides to take things to a whole new level?

05:11.580 --> 05:13.950
Melinda,you should call the police.You know that.

05:13.950 --> 05:15.870
I don't even think the police can protect me.

05:15.870 --> 05:17.780
With everything that I've learned about grandview's history,

05:17.780 --> 05:21.520
for people who do what I do,it never ends well.

05:22.180 --> 05:25.350
I really have to figure out who's doing this.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.920
I have an idea.

05:27.920 --> 05:30.070
I need to go home for 2 seconds.

05:30.070 --> 05:32.270
I'll be right back.

05:36.470 --> 05:39.110
We will leave this on tonight,

05:39.110 --> 05:42.750
and this should give us a perfect view of whoever's doing this.

05:42.750 --> 05:45.950
Or the world's most boring documentary of main street.

05:45.950 --> 05:47.980
Yeah,let's hope so.

05:47.980 --> 05:51.280
All right,let's just leave it there,forget all about it,

05:51.280 --> 05:52.140
and have a great day.

05:52.140 --> 05:54.060
Right.Time to make money,have fun.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.910
I'll open up.

06:05.470 --> 06:07.190
Yo.

06:07.670 --> 06:08.620
Yo.

06:08.620 --> 06:10.860
Dude,I live downstairs.

06:10.860 --> 06:13.530
What's the deal with the noise every night?

06:13.530 --> 06:14.430
What noise?

06:14.430 --> 06:17.080
Well,it kinda sounds like you're bowling with your furniture.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.890
Yeah,well,it wasn't me tonight,dude.

06:18.890 --> 06:19.880
I was just sleepin'.

06:19.880 --> 06:20.830
Oh,yeah?With who?

06:20.830 --> 06:22.460
Thor,roman god of thunder?

06:22.460 --> 06:23.500
You mean jupiter.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.090
Thor's the norse god of thunder.

06:25.090 --> 06:26.870
Oh,is that right,joseph campbell?

06:26.870 --> 06:28.150
Whatever.

06:28.150 --> 06:30.380
What would it take to get some silence up in here,man?

06:30.380 --> 06:33.210
You could stop talking and leave.

06:34.940 --> 06:40.080
Dude,your hamster habitat is like so upside down right now.

06:43.140 --> 06:46.250
It's a gerbil,and he likes it that way.

06:46.250 --> 06:47.980
Are we done?

07:35.780 --> 07:38.220
I don't believe it.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.720
Ok...

07:43.720 --> 07:45.930
here,give me the cord.

07:47.310 --> 07:49.090
All right.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.700
Keep going.

07:54.220 --> 07:56.050
Whoa,whoa,wait.

08:08.090 --> 08:09.260
Melinda: Why would you do this to me?

08:09.260 --> 08:10.460
I didn't do anything.

08:10.460 --> 08:12.160
What kind of person are you?

08:12.160 --> 08:13.530
I was here sleeping all night.

08:13.530 --> 08:15.380
Justin,we have it on tape.

08:15.380 --> 08:16.710
You don't know for sure that was me.

08:16.710 --> 08:17.870
Do you want to see the tape again,

08:17.870 --> 08:19.540
or should I just see if the police agree with me?

08:19.540 --> 08:20.680
Why don't you just cut the B.S.

08:20.680 --> 08:21.680
And tell us what's going on?

08:21.680 --> 08:26.060
Yeah,and why the hell everything in this room is upside down.

08:26.790 --> 08:28.000
Ok.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.080
Um,here.

08:34.110 --> 08:36.080
Check this out.

08:49.850 --> 08:51.450
You tell me what's going on.

08:51.450 --> 08:53.670
Are you saying you don't have any memory of this?

08:53.670 --> 08:54.390
None.

08:54.390 --> 08:56.060
As far as I know,I was asleep.

08:56.060 --> 08:58.000
Why did you paint witchcraft on my window?

08:58.000 --> 09:01.690
And what does the awdring of the woman with the wings mean?

09:01.690 --> 09:04.020
I think it means I'm haunted.

09:04.020 --> 09:05.760
Justin,I don't see ghosts anywhere.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.630
Just you,defacing my property.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.780
And I want it to stop.

09:09.780 --> 09:11.850
Yeah,well,me too.

09:11.850 --> 09:14.470
Ok,I got a lot to do,so you guys should just go.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.540
You know what,that's the wrong answer.

09:15.540 --> 09:18.200
Look,just leave me alone!

09:31.580 --> 09:33.490
I think what you're talking about is somnambulism.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.010
It's a lot more common than you might think.

09:35.010 --> 09:37.850
It happens mostly in children,but it does happen in adults.

09:37.850 --> 09:39.260
For example,my college girlfriend,

09:39.260 --> 09:41.700
I think she was asleep for our entire relationship.

09:41.700 --> 09:43.330
What causes it?

09:43.330 --> 09:44.790
Uh,I don't think she saw my spark.

09:44.790 --> 09:46.840
I'm talking about sleep-walking.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.460
Well,you'd have to ask a doctor to get that answer,

09:48.460 --> 09:49.610
but it could be a lot of things.

09:49.610 --> 09:53.280
Could be anxiety,it could be a reaction to drugs or alcohol.

09:53.280 --> 09:56.570
It could be a way to avoid people you see in the street and don't want to talk to.

09:56.570 --> 09:58.880
Oh,I'll remember that the next time you come into the store.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.030
That's harsh.

10:00.030 --> 10:03.320
Look,I just--I don't know whether I'm supposed to be afraid of him or help him.

10:03.320 --> 10:04.490
Well,we don't really know this guy,

10:04.490 --> 10:06.270
so I'll talk to some other professors he has

10:06.270 --> 10:08.510
and I'll ask some kids,to see what they know about him.

10:08.510 --> 10:09.550
I'll keep an eye on him,too.

10:09.550 --> 10:11.620
I just want to know what his secret is,you know,

10:11.620 --> 10:14.380
before anything else happens.

11:23.670 --> 11:25.610
Man: Justin yates?

11:25.610 --> 11:27.530
I'm actually in two of his classes.

11:27.530 --> 11:29.900
But he doesn't talk to me,or anybody else.

11:29.900 --> 11:33.070
The dude is like an island,like onto himself.

11:33.070 --> 11:34.760
Ok,moving past the awkward similes,

11:34.760 --> 11:36.350
maybe he just hangs out with a different crowd.

11:36.350 --> 11:38.130
Maybe he just doesn't like you.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.420
Everyone likes me,professor payne.

11:40.420 --> 11:42.440
It's like a curse,I swear.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.390
But this dude justin,he just doesn't like people.

11:45.390 --> 11:46.950
He's like a disanthrope.

11:46.950 --> 11:48.060
Misanthrope.

11:48.060 --> 11:49.520
You were close,though.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.200
Well,I'm glad you're getting your money's worth on education here,josh.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.360
Is there anything you can tell me at all about justin yates?

11:55.360 --> 11:57.700
I don't know what he's doing up there in his room at night,

11:57.700 --> 11:59.380
but it's real noisy.

11:59.380 --> 12:02.460
It's got something to do with his gerbil.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.480
I think we're done here.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.840
Jim: He looks like a zombie.

12:05.840 --> 12:06.440
Exactly.

12:06.440 --> 12:09.800
And he was in that same weird trance when he turned his room upside down.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.830
Now payne thinks that he's sleep-walking.

12:12.830 --> 12:16.970
I just keep thinking that it's another possession or ghost-related thing.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.410
But you haven't seen a ghost?

12:18.410 --> 12:19.920
Well,no.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.910
But he also said it could be a reaction to medication or alcohol.

12:22.910 --> 12:23.760
Well,if that were true,

12:23.760 --> 12:26.350
I would have slept-walked through my entire senior year in college?

12:26.350 --> 12:27.350
Is that a guy thing?

12:27.350 --> 12:31.130
This making jokes about college and sleep-walking?

12:31.620 --> 12:33.270
Oh,what was the name of the drug you thought you saw?

12:33.270 --> 12:34.590
I think there's something else going on here.

12:34.590 --> 12:37.180
I didn't really get to see the label,but,uh...

12:37.450 --> 12:40.080
-car--carba--
-yeah,carbamazepine.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.720
Look,this is a drug to control convulsions,all right?

12:42.720 --> 12:44.160
Payne could be half-right.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.150
I mean,somnambulism in adults is usually a symptom of mental illness

12:47.150 --> 12:49.310
or seizures of some sort.

12:49.310 --> 12:52.400
So you think there might be something really wrong with him?

12:52.400 --> 12:55.510
I just think,you know,it might not be spiritual.

12:55.510 --> 12:58.110
It could be very physical.

13:08.210 --> 13:09.360
What are you doing here?

13:09.360 --> 13:11.170
Looking for you.

13:11.170 --> 13:12.410
How did you find me?

13:12.410 --> 13:14.350
Doesn't matter.

13:14.350 --> 13:15.560
Look,I know this is hard,

13:15.560 --> 13:18.550
but I need you to believe that I want to help you.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.100
Why should you,huh?

13:21.100 --> 13:22.740
I haven't helped you very much.

13:22.740 --> 13:25.010
I'm not keeping score.

13:25.340 --> 13:26.990
It's just what I do.

13:26.990 --> 13:28.890
I don't need help.

13:29.730 --> 13:30.700
Not yet.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.690
You're sick,aren't you?

13:33.120 --> 13:37.600
Look,I didn't press any charges,ok,I kept your secret.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.650
I at least deserve the truth.

13:40.650 --> 13:42.630
It's not that I'm sick.

13:43.870 --> 13:46.650
It's just that I'm going to die.

13:47.910 --> 13:53.120
Allyweird smell,like there was something burning.

13:53.120 --> 13:57.490
Day and night,it never went away,so I finally went to a doctor.

13:57.490 --> 13:59.310
How long ago was that?

13:59.310 --> 14:00.590
2 years ago.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.790
I was in ohio before I left to come here.

14:02.790 --> 14:05.300
Wasn't there anything they could do?

14:05.620 --> 14:09.380
Yeah,you'd think,but this particular aneurysm was in a place so deep in my brain

14:09.380 --> 14:11.490
that they couldn't get to it.

14:11.490 --> 14:13.720
They knew it was going to burst,they knew it was going to kill me.

14:13.720 --> 14:14.980
They just...

14:14.980 --> 14:16.540
didn't know when.

14:16.540 --> 14:18.130
It isn't always fatal,is it?

14:18.130 --> 14:19.170
No.

14:19.170 --> 14:22.620
But it's all about location,location,location.

14:22.620 --> 14:25.440
And the size,of course.

14:26.260 --> 14:28.790
I'm sorry.

14:30.220 --> 14:32.360
Is that why you cut yourself off from everyone?

14:32.360 --> 14:33.830
Yeah.Pretty much.

14:33.830 --> 14:35.410
But I don't have a big family.

14:35.410 --> 14:38.100
It's just my brother and sister back in ohio.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.200
I don't understand.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.420
Wouldn't you want to be close to them now?

14:41.420 --> 14:44.080
-Wouldn't you want--
-they don't know.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.780
It's better this way.

14:45.780 --> 14:47.850
I made a clean break.

14:47.850 --> 14:50.300
They don't have to feel sorry for me or worry about me,

14:50.300 --> 14:53.350
and I don't have to see all that pity in their eyes.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.990
Doesn't sound fair.

14:57.070 --> 15:02.830
So what's the deal,justin,with you turning everything in your room upside down?

15:03.810 --> 15:08.740
I think I know why,but I can't tell you yet.

15:08.740 --> 15:12.440
Look,it seems to me like you have this,I don't know,

15:12.440 --> 15:17.710
a pipeline,I guess,into death and wherever it is we go after it.

15:17.710 --> 15:20.330
I probably don't know as much as you think I do.

15:20.330 --> 15:21.840
Just tell me.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.740
Do you really talk to the dead?

15:23.740 --> 15:26.530
Do you really help them?

15:28.130 --> 15:29.700
Yeah.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.100
Yeah,I do.

15:36.800 --> 15:39.640
That's why I'm here.

15:39.640 --> 15:42.410
I don't know how,but I was meant to meet you.

15:42.410 --> 15:43.980
Justin,look,I...

15:43.980 --> 15:46.740
I help the dead with their unfinished business.

15:46.740 --> 15:50.470
I help them and their loved ones find closure.

15:50.470 --> 15:52.910
Why wait?

15:52.910 --> 15:54.200
You're alive.

15:54.200 --> 15:54.800
Right now.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.730
Why wouldn't you reach out to the people who love you

15:57.730 --> 16:01.360
so that they can spend time with you while they still can?

16:01.540 --> 16:05.270
I don't need your help with the living.

16:05.270 --> 16:07.420
I need your help with the dead.

16:07.420 --> 16:08.070
What?

16:08.070 --> 16:09.980
After I'm gone...

16:09.980 --> 16:13.280
I need you to help me find someone.

16:13.280 --> 16:15.700
Someone who's dead.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.960
Someone who...

16:17.960 --> 16:21.050
may be waiting for me.

16:31.350 --> 16:33.610
Melinda: He seems at peace with it.

16:33.610 --> 16:35.180
Ah,it's a mask.

16:35.180 --> 16:37.290
Deep down,he's probably scared to death.

16:37.290 --> 16:38.070
Maybe.

16:38.070 --> 16:39.310
But I really think he has a plan.

16:39.310 --> 16:41.950
He's thought a lot about it.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.500
What are you doing?

16:43.500 --> 16:46.390
I'm just trying to scan on this drawing of justin's,

16:46.390 --> 16:49.160
do a search and see if anything comes up.

16:50.330 --> 16:53.390
Yeah,what's that like to know that he could just die at any minute,just like that?

16:53.390 --> 16:54.510
I can't imagine.

16:54.510 --> 16:56.940
Well,if you think about it,that's pretty much what we all face.

16:56.940 --> 17:00.310
Ok,true,but you know,we do a pretty good job of pretending it's a long way off,

17:00.310 --> 17:01.750
and,well,the odds are on our side.

17:01.750 --> 17:02.610
But for justin...

17:02.610 --> 17:07.800
yeah,he's got inside information,and he knows the odds are totally the other way for him.

17:07.800 --> 17:08.869
That's gotta be hard.

17:08.869 --> 17:10.500
I mean,would you want to know?

17:10.500 --> 17:15.380
If you were gonna die in a month-- Or a week-- Or a year-- Would you?

17:15.780 --> 17:17.359
Yeah.

17:17.359 --> 17:19.260
Yeah,I think so.

17:19.260 --> 17:23.450
Say my good-byes,get everything straightened out,prepare.

17:23.450 --> 17:24.230
How about you?

17:24.230 --> 17:26.369
No,I'd want to wake up that morning thinking everything was great.

17:26.369 --> 17:29.450
Have no idea,and then boom,all of a sudden,lights out.

17:29.450 --> 17:31.640
No fears,no regrets,no sadness.

17:31.640 --> 17:33.890
Just happily oblivious until the end.

17:33.890 --> 17:37.420
Ah,happily oblivious,another guy thing.

17:37.420 --> 17:39.390
Don't knock it.

17:39.390 --> 17:42.200
Awareness is highly overrated.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.740
Wait,this is it.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.870
That's what justin drew on my window.

17:52.870 --> 17:55.320
It's the figurehead for a boat.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.480
Who's boat?

17:59.390 --> 18:02.760
witchcraft+boat

19:18.300 --> 19:23.270
Woman: I'm waiting for you.

19:29.140 --> 19:33.660
Justin.

19:34.700 --> 19:37.190
Julie?

19:50.710 --> 19:53.220
I can't believe it's you.

19:53.220 --> 19:55.660
Find me.

19:58.350 --> 19:59.720
Yeah?

19:59.720 --> 20:02.380
I'll be waiting.

20:24.180 --> 20:25.320
Justin...

20:25.320 --> 20:26.250
melinda.

20:26.250 --> 20:28.340
It's perfect.I saw her.

20:28.340 --> 20:29.210
Who?

20:29.210 --> 20:30.140
My girlfriend.

20:30.140 --> 20:31.740
I mean,she was my girlfriend.

20:31.740 --> 20:34.370
She's dead,and I saw her.

20:34.710 --> 20:35.360
Where?

20:35.360 --> 20:38.940
Here,in this room,and in the mirror.

20:38.940 --> 20:40.390
I mean,I think it's my brain.

20:40.390 --> 20:42.080
This aneurysm,it's letting me see things.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.030
Ok,justin,calm down.

20:45.070 --> 20:48.400
was your girlfriend's name julie?

20:48.890 --> 20:50.880
How did you know that?

20:50.880 --> 20:53.830
I know what witchcraft means.

20:53.830 --> 20:57.590
I know what the picture you drew means.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.320
How?

20:59.320 --> 21:02.120
You can't hide anything on the 'net.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.530
You,of all people,should know that.

21:04.720 --> 21:07.400
Tell me what happened.

21:09.450 --> 21:11.440
It was 3 years ago.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.320
3 years,2 months and a week.

21:18.470 --> 21:20.400
I was datin' this girl julie.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.900
She was like...

21:21.900 --> 21:23.550
nobody I ever knew.

21:23.550 --> 21:26.780
Her family had money,so she could pretty much do whatever she wanted.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.960
They gave her a freakin' vintage boat for christmas,

21:28.960 --> 21:32.050
and I'm not talking about the kind in a bottle.

21:32.050 --> 21:35.760
She was wild,totally fearless.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.890
She hung out with this really cool crowd,

21:38.890 --> 21:40.960
but for some reason,she liked me.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.710
She said it was because I was smart.

21:42.710 --> 21:43.980
Who knows?

21:43.980 --> 21:46.160
But I loved being around her.

21:46.160 --> 21:49.240
It was like you never knew what was going to happen next.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.720
Want some?

21:53.720 --> 21:55.370
No.

21:58.920 --> 22:02.540
When it became night, she went below to get a sweater,

22:02.550 --> 22:05.730
and she told me to start the engine so we can get home fast.

22:18.620 --> 22:20.160
I don't know what happened,

22:20.160 --> 22:22.360
but when I went down below to find julie,

22:22.370 --> 22:24.540
the whole boat just flipped...

22:24.950 --> 22:29.380
The keel must have ripped off in the blast, everything was upside down.

22:50.660 --> 22:52.390
I didn't know what to do.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.760
I didn't even know how much longer I could hold my breath.

23:19.900 --> 23:22.870
Why didn't you ever tell me any of this?

23:23.030 --> 23:24.930
I never told anyone.

23:26.870 --> 23:30.630
I told everyone that I didn't remember anything.

23:32.030 --> 23:34.990
So that's why you've been turning everything upside down?

23:35.740 --> 23:37.590
It's like you're acting out your guilt.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.120
Someone else has been acting it out for me.

23:40.130 --> 23:42.670
You may not have had another choice, justin.

23:42.930 --> 23:44.330
Both of you could have died.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.800
That would have been better.

23:46.700 --> 23:49.520
Better than having to live with this for the last 3 years;

23:49.630 --> 23:51.690
having to see her eyes every night...

23:51.700 --> 23:54.380
knowing that she watched me swim away from her.

23:57.670 --> 24:00.480
Dying there would have made things a lot easier.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.650
-But you weren't meant to.
-Right.

24:05.350 --> 24:09.170
No, I was meant to hang out and get an aneurysm a couple years later.

24:09.350 --> 24:11.090
Do you think that's your punishment?

24:11.100 --> 24:13.380
I think I was meant to die on that boat.

24:14.210 --> 24:16.160
I was meant to be with julie.

24:17.450 --> 24:20.530
This?It's just a correction.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.410
Better late than never.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.560
-Justin...
-no, really, it's ok.

24:25.570 --> 24:27.600
I'm totally cool with this.

24:27.780 --> 24:31.720
Besides...I think whatever's waiting for me after I die,

24:31.730 --> 24:34.760
it's going to be a lot more interesting than what I'm leaving behind.

24:38.040 --> 24:39.680
Right, little buddy?

24:48.310 --> 24:50.810
Justin, it's gonna be all right.

25:06.200 --> 25:12.150
-Am I...?
-Yes.You're dead.

25:17.360 --> 25:19.870
I totally feel normal, totally alive.

25:19.880 --> 25:23.060
Sometimes people don't know what's happening to them at first.

25:24.110 --> 25:27.640
You died in your sleep last night, and that's why you were able to see julie.

25:27.910 --> 25:30.880
Yeah.She told me to find her.

25:30.890 --> 25:34.560
-Where?
-I think I know where.

25:35.060 --> 25:37.980
Justin, you have to go into the light.Ok?

25:37.990 --> 25:40.950
I promise that I will find julie, and I will cross her over.

25:40.960 --> 25:45.590
No.She's waiting for me.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.180
-I have to go.
-Now, justin, wait!

25:58.760 --> 25:59.960
Come on.

26:02.520 --> 26:03.490
Hey, are you ok?

26:03.500 --> 26:04.640
Comparatively speaking.

26:04.650 --> 26:05.270
How are you?

26:05.280 --> 26:07.630
I'd feel better if I knew where his spirit was.

26:09.210 --> 26:12.130
-You, uh, talked to him after he...?
-Yeah.

26:12.480 --> 26:14.700
He seemed relieved in a way.

26:14.710 --> 26:16.640
I guess it was easier on him then he thought it was going to be.

26:16.650 --> 26:17.930
But he dn'idt want to cross over?

26:17.940 --> 26:21.850
He saw the ghost of his girlfriend, and she told him to come and get her.

26:21.860 --> 26:24.030
That's romantic in a dawn of the dead kind of way.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.950
Yeah, he blames himself for her death.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.670
And I wouldn't be surprised if she blames him, too.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.200
Well, the school notified his next of kin.

26:29.210 --> 26:31.100
It's his brother and sister, they're flying out tonight.

26:31.110 --> 26:32.790
You can find out what they know.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.080
Maybe they know something they don't even know they know.

26:35.190 --> 26:36.930
Easy for you to say.

26:36.940 --> 26:38.240
What are you going to do with the rodent?

26:38.250 --> 26:39.960
I think you two need each other.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.880
Promise I'll be back in an hour.

27:45.890 --> 27:47.400
Will they even talk to you?

27:47.410 --> 27:50.700
Well, since I'm the one who found their brother's body, I guess so.

27:50.710 --> 27:52.890
You know, we could just close up for an hour.

27:52.900 --> 27:53.810
I could go with you.

27:53.820 --> 27:56.220
No, it looks like everybody actually wants to shop today.

27:56.230 --> 27:57.470
I'll be back soon.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.360
Excuse me, how much are these?

28:00.450 --> 28:02.820
Uh, the big ones are 30, the small ones are 20.

28:02.830 --> 28:05.220
They're beautiful.Are they local?

28:05.490 --> 28:07.380
From a mansion in piermont.

28:07.390 --> 28:10.360
There was like 40 or 50 doors.

28:12.590 --> 28:14.060
I have him now.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.910
You have to stay out of it.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.010
I'm sorry?

28:18.720 --> 28:20.670
It was his own free will.

28:20.680 --> 28:22.550
There's nothing you can do.

28:23.320 --> 28:26.170
Stay away, or I'll have someone burn your house down.

28:29.720 --> 28:32.010
Well, that's a lot of doors.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.810
Be great for a french farce.

28:36.970 --> 28:39.270
-You ok?
-Yeah.

28:39.890 --> 28:41.640
-Are you?
-Me?

28:41.650 --> 28:43.220
Sure.Fine.

28:43.230 --> 28:46.350
I'm gonna take two of the big ones.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.690
Andy, look.

29:13.070 --> 29:15.850
-Oh, I'm sorry, I can come back.
-No, no, no.

29:15.860 --> 29:19.060
-Did you know justin?
-Well, not very well.

29:19.500 --> 29:22.610
But yes.I'm melinda gordon.

29:22.620 --> 29:24.230
You must be his brother and sister.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.630
You're the one that found him.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.120
Yes.I'm so sorry.

29:28.670 --> 29:30.350
The coroner is telling us it was sudden,

29:30.360 --> 29:33.480
but they really don't know yet what happened to justin.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.480
Do you know something?

29:35.580 --> 29:37.630
Do you know why our brother died?

29:37.640 --> 29:39.640
I know this is really hard to understand.

29:39.650 --> 29:42.050
I'm not sure that I totally do.

29:42.420 --> 29:45.400
But it was really important to him not to be pitied.

29:45.620 --> 29:48.110
He didn't want the two of you to have to grieve.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.430
He knew that he was going to die,

29:49.440 --> 29:51.210
and there was nothing you could do to change that.

29:51.220 --> 29:52.660
It's just not fair.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.430
Didn't he know that we loved him?

29:54.440 --> 29:55.950
He's the only family we have.

29:55.960 --> 29:59.470
If it helps, he seemed really at peace with it.

29:59.860 --> 30:02.220
For him, it was like a journey that he had to take,

30:02.230 --> 30:04.120
that he--he wanted to take.

30:04.130 --> 30:06.290
He just felt like he had to do it alone.

30:06.480 --> 30:08.110
Yeah, that sounds like justin.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.270
Do you know about the boat thing?

30:10.930 --> 30:12.880
Said he didn't remember what happened on that boat,

30:12.890 --> 30:14.720
but he was never the same after that.

30:15.040 --> 30:19.660
It was like he just withdrew, like he felt he didn't belong here anymore.

30:19.930 --> 30:22.210
What was he like before?

30:22.970 --> 30:28.320
Just...like a curious little boy, with the best heart.

30:28.900 --> 30:30.490
Our parents died when we were pretty young.

30:30.500 --> 30:32.030
Justin was only 10.

30:32.130 --> 30:36.290
He used to save his money, whatever he could get from errands, dog walking,

30:36.430 --> 30:38.800
and he'd buy things for our mom and dad.

30:39.090 --> 30:40.670
But they were dead?

30:42.850 --> 30:45.060
And he would get newspapers that my dad used to read,

30:45.070 --> 30:46.830
and books that my mom would like,

30:47.160 --> 30:50.190
and he'd go there and read to them, sit with them for hours.

30:50.200 --> 30:54.030
Bring my dad's favorite snacks, said he didn't want them to be lonely.

30:54.040 --> 30:56.200
He gave up time with his friends.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.780
He felt like he couldn't abandon mom and dad.

30:58.920 --> 31:01.310
People started calling him the gravesitter.

31:02.430 --> 31:05.800
That'S...that's amazing.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.830
It was like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders.

31:09.890 --> 31:13.050
He just...felt things very deeply.

31:14.120 --> 31:17.110
Was he happy?When he was with julie?

31:17.120 --> 31:21.480
-He was, I guess.But we weren'T.
-Why not?

31:21.490 --> 31:23.820
She just wasn't anything like justin.

31:23.900 --> 31:25.820
She was a spoiled rich kid.

31:25.830 --> 31:30.320
Hung with a really fast crowd, other rich kids.Bad kids.

31:30.580 --> 31:33.840
That detective thought the whole boat thing was suspicious.

31:33.850 --> 31:35.380
What detective?

31:56.340 --> 31:57.570
Julie?

32:43.680 --> 32:46.430
You came.I knew you would.

32:46.440 --> 32:48.840
Julie, I'm so sorry.

32:50.380 --> 32:52.180
You must hate me for what I did.

32:52.190 --> 32:53.540
It's all right.

32:54.230 --> 32:56.070
It's what got me here.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.680
What is this place?

32:57.690 --> 32:59.110
Our new home.

32:59.110 --> 33:01.070
This is where we belong.

33:02.150 --> 33:04.000
Why?Why are you here?

33:04.010 --> 33:05.590
I followed you.

33:06.480 --> 33:09.640
I was mad at you for leaving me like that.

33:10.860 --> 33:15.090
I've been watching you all this time, waiting for you to come to me.

33:15.260 --> 33:17.610
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

33:21.350 --> 33:27.150
I met someone here.Someone like us.

33:27.550 --> 33:28.740
Dead?

33:28.750 --> 33:30.720
Someone with secrets.

33:31.770 --> 33:33.450
Someone who's bad like us.

33:33.460 --> 33:35.010
He showed me things.

33:36.450 --> 33:38.600
Wait, am I-- am I bad?

33:38.610 --> 33:39.950
You know you are.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.940
You left me there to die.

33:45.550 --> 33:53.600
It's ok.It's allowed here.

33:56.350 --> 33:57.850
What about the light?

33:58.680 --> 34:01.170
-Melinda said I should--
-there's a secret down here.

34:01.180 --> 34:03.530
Nobody knows it, not even melinda.

34:03.860 --> 34:05.290
What secret?

34:06.120 --> 34:07.980
You can live again.

34:09.570 --> 34:11.810
You can be in the world whenever you want,

34:11.820 --> 34:16.920
and you can touch and feel and taste and laugh and cry.

34:16.929 --> 34:18.889
We'll teach you how.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.560
I'm just a friend of the family,

34:32.570 --> 34:36.960
but I heard ythat ou think julie anderson rt bemighesponsible for sinking the boat?

34:36.969 --> 34:38.290
I don't think it, I know it.

34:38.300 --> 34:39.679
Well, what makes you so sure?

34:39.690 --> 34:41.550
Julie anderson was heavy into drugs.

34:41.560 --> 34:43.389
She owed money, lots of it.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.380
So what do you think happened?

34:45.389 --> 34:47.949
Well, the boat was in her name.

34:47.960 --> 34:51.750
About a month before the sinking, she took insurance out on the boat.

34:51.880 --> 34:54.300
Covered everything, all kinds of liability.

34:54.310 --> 34:57.920
So you're saying that she sank the boat on purpose?

34:58.460 --> 35:00.900
I'm saying that she planned to sink the boat,

35:00.910 --> 35:03.110
she planned to blame it on justin.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.330
Have you ever talked to justin about all this?

35:05.340 --> 35:08.330
No.He didn't have any memory of anything,

35:08.340 --> 35:11.000
and I didn't have any real proof.

35:11.020 --> 35:12.790
Family got to the D.A.

35:12.880 --> 35:14.720
They got the whole thing buried.

35:15.230 --> 35:17.670
-Are you sure about all this?
-Oh, yeah.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.320
By the time julie anderson was 20,

35:20.330 --> 35:23.980
she had a long and colorful history with this department.

35:24.720 --> 35:26.700
I can't thank you enough.

35:28.620 --> 35:32.850
There is absolutely no entertainment value whatsoever in owning a gerbil.

35:32.860 --> 35:36.220
He won't eat a hot dog, he turned his nose up at a potato chip earlier.

35:36.230 --> 35:38.250
-Hello?
-This guy won't show me any affection!

35:38.260 --> 35:39.360
He doesn't snuggle with me.

35:39.370 --> 35:41.120
I need an animal that will cuddle!

35:41.130 --> 35:42.820
Can you focus, please?

35:42.830 --> 35:44.300
Ok, justin fell for a bad woman.

35:44.310 --> 35:45.780
He's not the first guy that's happened to.

35:45.790 --> 35:46.990
She's been haunting him.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.470
I think she even jumped into somebody else's body.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.940
-A possession?
-Yeah.

35:52.630 --> 35:54.360
But I think it's just a temporary thing.

35:54.370 --> 35:55.070
Remember, it happened to you?

35:55.080 --> 35:57.960
I think I'll be remembering the time the ghost got into my body,

35:57.970 --> 36:00.850
made me vomit blood, long after I've forgotten my name, my address,

36:00.860 --> 36:02.120
and what a car key is for, yeah.

36:02.130 --> 36:04.480
I think she's found something here besides justin,

36:04.490 --> 36:07.000
and she's using the possession as a way to get me a message.

36:07.010 --> 36:08.080
What's the message?

36:08.090 --> 36:09.620
Basically, to step off.

36:09.630 --> 36:13.350
She said he's hers, that he came here on his own, no one forced him.

36:13.360 --> 36:14.820
Came on his own?Came where?

36:14.830 --> 36:17.360
Where all the damaged souls in grandview go.

36:18.190 --> 36:20.540
No, no, no, no.No, I'm not going there.

36:20.550 --> 36:22.050
I still have hair on the back of my neck

36:22.060 --> 36:23.530
that's still standing up from the last time.

36:23.540 --> 36:26.290
-No.
-Ok...if you're too scared.

36:26.900 --> 36:30.110
She plays me like a piano!Wait.

36:30.130 --> 36:32.580
I'm surprised you haven't bricked up that hole yet.

36:32.590 --> 36:34.670
I thought I might have to go back in there.

36:38.120 --> 36:42.000
Have you ever thought about having a revolving door installed, maybe a turnstile?

36:55.690 --> 36:58.180
-What was that?
-Nothing.

37:03.660 --> 37:07.170
-Are we there yet?
-No, let's go.

37:29.110 --> 37:30.110
Melinda.

37:31.110 --> 37:33.290
-He's here.
-What?

37:34.030 --> 37:35.390
You really shouldn't be here.

37:35.400 --> 37:36.350
Neither should you.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.200
-No, I belong here.
-No, you don'T.

37:38.210 --> 37:40.700
-They're just trying to make you think--
-it's really all right.

37:40.710 --> 37:42.380
There's so much I can do.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.920
They're gonna teach me things here.

37:44.980 --> 37:46.100
What things?

37:46.110 --> 37:49.600
You don't have to tell her anything.She's not welcome.

37:50.570 --> 37:52.690
-Julie's here.
-Oh, that's good.

37:52.700 --> 37:54.200
Send her my regards.

37:55.500 --> 37:58.580
Justin, julie made that boat sink on purpose.

37:58.870 --> 38:02.660
She was going to blame you and then collect on the insurance.

38:04.900 --> 38:07.890
-I think she was trying to kill you.
-Big deal.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.170
You left me there to die.You killed me.

38:11.180 --> 38:12.590
You were just being human.

38:12.600 --> 38:16.370
Ok, you were really scared, and being scared doesn't make you bad.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.330
You're never going to know if your choice would have changed anything.

38:19.340 --> 38:20.350
We need you here.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.310
And you know why we need you here.

38:23.380 --> 38:24.920
You have nobody.

38:25.270 --> 38:27.160
Nobody cares about you.

38:27.420 --> 38:29.270
We're your only family now.

38:29.280 --> 38:32.770
That's not true.Ok, your brother and sister, they care.

38:34.670 --> 38:37.390
-You spoke to them?
-They're here.

38:37.400 --> 38:40.170
-They came as soon as they heard.
-She's lying.

38:40.180 --> 38:43.900
Come on.Justin, they told me about the grave.

38:44.070 --> 38:46.750
They told me how heartbroken you were when your parents died.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.990
They told me that you went to see them every single day;

38:49.000 --> 38:50.860
that you read to them, that you brought them gifts.

38:50.870 --> 38:54.100
They told me how much you had to give up just to be with them!

38:55.460 --> 38:58.260
Those aren't the actions of somebody who belongs here.

39:00.210 --> 39:02.780
You have so much love in your heart.

39:04.100 --> 39:06.070
They don't need what you have here.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.770
They don't want what you have.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.610
You have to go into the light.

39:14.100 --> 39:17.450
Melinda, I have no idea what's going on.Should I be scared?

39:22.630 --> 39:24.280
Were you really going to kill me?

39:24.360 --> 39:26.210
It crossed my mind.

39:27.100 --> 39:28.790
Did you like me at all?

39:29.090 --> 39:32.280
I tolerated you-- barely.

39:32.870 --> 39:35.190
And my friends and i laughed about you.

39:35.200 --> 39:39.420
I just wanted money, justin, and I knew you would follow me anywhere.

39:39.430 --> 39:41.440
She's trying to make you angry.

39:41.950 --> 39:45.130
She wants you to hate her because that's how ghosts like her get stronger.

39:45.140 --> 39:46.620
Please don't let her do it.

39:47.190 --> 39:51.150
It's ok.Really.

39:56.410 --> 40:00.470
I still loved it.Being with you.

40:01.760 --> 40:05.060
The way you made me feel like I had something to offer.

40:06.270 --> 40:09.650
I just never got a chance to offer to someone better than you.

40:11.930 --> 40:13.590
So thanks for that.

40:13.820 --> 40:15.560
And for the rest of it.

40:19.210 --> 40:20.800
I forgive you.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.820
And I forgive myself for leaving you there.

40:45.390 --> 40:47.400
I'm so proud of you.

40:50.110 --> 40:53.940
There's just one more thing you're gonna have to help me with.

40:55.800 --> 40:59.420
You know, it would be really cruel if you were lying about this.

40:59.430 --> 41:01.650
I'm not.I promise.

41:05.600 --> 41:06.850
Justin's here with us.

41:06.860 --> 41:09.870
I told him that you were in grandview and you wanted to say good-bye.

41:09.930 --> 41:11.450
And that I'm sorry.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.420
He also wanted to say that he was sorry.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.110
Justin, if you're there...

41:17.540 --> 41:21.130
or here, sorry isn't good enough.

41:21.710 --> 41:24.500
How could you cut us off like that?We're your family!

41:24.510 --> 41:27.530
Did we do something to make you feel we didn't love you?

41:28.150 --> 41:30.820
We would have helped you, we would have been there for you.

41:31.070 --> 41:32.840
If I could do it over...

41:33.230 --> 41:34.930
I could do it again.

41:35.820 --> 41:38.820
If he could do it over again, he would.

41:45.180 --> 41:47.040
Oh, that's gotta be it.

41:48.030 --> 41:49.910
He sees the light.

41:50.190 --> 41:52.220
He's ready to cross over.

41:52.230 --> 41:53.530
What does that mean?

41:53.540 --> 41:55.090
We'll never talk to him again?

41:55.100 --> 41:58.910
Tell them I felt them with me, no matter how scared I got.

41:59.270 --> 42:01.240
And tell them that somehow,

42:02.220 --> 42:04.970
I knew I wouldn't be alive that long, and it's ok.

42:06.300 --> 42:09.970
It's ok.It's ok.

42:11.240 --> 42:14.410
-I'll tell them.
-Tell us what?

42:14.420 --> 42:16.370
You've given me a lot of hope.

42:16.790 --> 42:18.870
You do that for a lot of people.

42:19.390 --> 42:21.850
Don't stop, ok?No matter what.

42:22.220 --> 42:25.390
And tell professor payne that I'm sorry for stealing his files.

42:25.930 --> 42:28.570
And for posting all those disses on the blog.

42:28.880 --> 42:32.580
Oh, and tell him that the gerbil, he only eats organic food.

42:33.190 --> 42:35.090
I don't think he knows that.

42:38.450 --> 42:40.380
I'm gonna come back.

42:43.010 --> 42:44.690
Some day I'm going to come back,

42:44.700 --> 42:46.990
and I'm gonna tell you what's on the other side.

42:48.030 --> 42:49.960
I'll be waiting.

42:50.020 --> 42:53.100
Thank you...for keeping my secret.

43:03.980 --> 43:06.180
I always wanted to touch your face again.

43:06.820 --> 43:09.950
-Who?
-My mom.

43:13.380 --> 43:17.750
