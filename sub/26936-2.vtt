WEBVTT

00:04.003 --> 00:06.423
We got two brooches
and two red gemstones.

00:06.423 --> 00:08.675
-Yes.
-RICK: That's pretty amazing.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.968
This is not
your ordinary gem.

00:10.968 --> 00:12.679
-It's super ancient.
-Now we're cookin'.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.805
These artifacts are pushing us
back farther in time

00:14.805 --> 00:16.557
-than I ever thought.
-Here it comes.

00:16.557 --> 00:18.559
RICK: For the first time
in two and a quarter centuries,

00:18.559 --> 00:20.185
we can look underground
in the Money Pit.

00:20.185 --> 00:21.812
We can give you guys
some answers.

00:21.812 --> 00:23.231
MARTY:
 What are the lighter spots?

00:23.231 --> 00:24.440
I would say it's pure gold.

00:24.440 --> 00:25.734
GARY:
Holy shmoly.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.236
We have found our first gold
on Oak Island.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.951
NARRATOR: There is an island
 in the North Atlantic

00:34.951 --> 00:38.662
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.662 --> 00:41.957
for more than 200 years.

00:41.957 --> 00:45.085
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:45.085 --> 00:47.756
with strange symbols carved
into it,

00:47.756 --> 00:50.716
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.716 --> 00:54.637
and a lead cross,
whose origin may stretch back

00:54.637 --> 00:57.055
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:57.055 --> 00:59.768
To date, six men have died

00:59.768 --> 01:02.561
trying to solve the mystery.

01:02.561 --> 01:05.105
And, according to legend,

01:05.105 --> 01:07.692
one more will have to die

01:07.692 --> 01:11.403
before the treasure
can be found.

01:14.948 --> 01:16.950
♪ ♪

01:21.873 --> 01:25.668
It is a moment of great
excitement on Oak Island

01:25.668 --> 01:29.671
as Rick Lagina and metal
detection expert Gary Drayton

01:29.671 --> 01:31.882
head to the home of veteran
treasure hunter

01:31.882 --> 01:33.259
Dan Blankenship...

01:33.259 --> 01:34.718
-You have it?
-Yeah.

01:34.718 --> 01:36.179
...with what they believe to be

01:36.179 --> 01:38.389
another exciting discovery.

01:38.389 --> 01:40.224
-Hey, guys.
-Look who's here.

01:40.224 --> 01:43.144
NARRATOR: They are eager to show
 him and Rick's brother Marty

01:43.144 --> 01:47.231
an object they recently found
on Lot 21.

01:47.231 --> 01:51.027
You guys have the look of, uh,
somebody who's on a mission.

01:51.027 --> 01:53.822
Yeah, we got a little
top-pocket find.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.156
-We do?
-Yeah.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.575
Gary was metal detecting,
and he found something

01:57.575 --> 01:58.826
he wants to show you.

01:58.826 --> 02:01.829
I'm here.
(chuckles)

02:01.829 --> 02:06.376
Well, we found a nice piece...

02:06.376 --> 02:08.752
of jewelry.

02:08.752 --> 02:11.673
RICK:
Wow.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.592
It's a brooch,
but it's a fancy brooch.

02:14.592 --> 02:18.847
Definitely, a lot of work
went into this.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.807
Oh, my gosh!

02:21.807 --> 02:24.644
It's another bobby-dazzler.
Look!

02:24.644 --> 02:26.562
NARRATOR:
 Just moments earlier,

02:26.562 --> 02:30.233
while looking for possible
metal artifacts on Lot 21,

02:30.233 --> 02:33.319
Rick and Gary made an
astonishing discovery.

02:33.319 --> 02:36.447
GARY:
 It's a bloody brooch.
 Look at that.

02:36.447 --> 02:39.449
NARRATOR:
 For the second time
 in less than one year,

02:39.449 --> 02:41.618
they have located
what appears to be

02:41.618 --> 02:43.288
a genuine piece
of antique jewelry.

02:43.288 --> 02:47.584
Something that, once analyzed,

02:47.584 --> 02:49.586
might validate numerous legends

02:49.586 --> 02:51.628
about a vast treasure
of gold and jewels

02:51.628 --> 02:54.799
being buried on the island
hundreds of years ago.

02:57.384 --> 03:00.388
You can see where the pin was
on the back.

03:00.388 --> 03:03.265
-DAN: I see.
-GARY: Yeah.

03:03.265 --> 03:07.020
Aren't we looking for gold,
silver, coins, and jewelry?

03:07.020 --> 03:08.896
-Yes, we are.
-Yeah.

03:08.896 --> 03:11.399
GARY:
And we're finding more jewelry.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.401
MARTY:
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.152
-It's a second gemstone...
-Yeah,

03:15.152 --> 03:17.864
second one with
a-a gemstone in it.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.865
MARTY:
Hmm.

03:19.865 --> 03:22.743
Look at this, Rick.
We've got it.

03:22.743 --> 03:24.370
NARRATOR:
 Last year, while exploring

03:24.370 --> 03:26.455
near the middle of the island
on Lot 8,

03:26.455 --> 03:29.334
Rick and Gary
unearthed a jeweled brooch,

03:29.334 --> 03:31.877
set with a similar
red-colored stone.

03:31.877 --> 03:34.923
-Look at that.
-Oh, man.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.341
NARRATOR:
 A stone that was later
 determined to be

03:37.341 --> 03:39.426
a hand-cut Rhodolite Garnet,

03:39.426 --> 03:44.057
possibly dating back
as early as the 16th century.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.433
RICK:
That's gorgeous.

03:46.433 --> 03:48.436
It's a brooch, another one.

03:48.436 --> 03:51.855
And it's got a bright red
jewel on it.

03:51.855 --> 03:54.776
Could be valuable, spendable.

03:54.776 --> 03:58.905
The jewel is much smaller
than the find last year,

03:58.905 --> 04:02.449
a little bit more intricate
design on the setting.

04:02.449 --> 04:05.870
This is much more
well-preserved.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.997
Is it a unique,
interesting find? Absolutely.

04:08.997 --> 04:11.668
MARTY:
How old do you think that is?

04:11.668 --> 04:15.504
It wouldn't surprise me
if that's 1700s or even older.

04:15.504 --> 04:19.884
Well, they've made jewelry
for a long time, you know that.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.095
-Exactly.
-I have visions of, like,

04:22.095 --> 04:24.680
pirates filling their pockets
full of jewelry,

04:24.680 --> 04:27.391
running across the island
dropping this stuff.

04:29.226 --> 04:31.353
NARRATOR:
 It has been well-documented
 that the waters

04:31.353 --> 04:35.191
in and around Oak Island
were frequented by a number

04:35.191 --> 04:38.319
of Portuguese, Spanish
and English pirates

04:38.319 --> 04:42.865
dating back as early
as the 16th century.

04:42.865 --> 04:46.494
There was even one pirate--
Captain James Anderson--

04:46.494 --> 04:49.663
who lived on the island
after fleeing the United States

04:49.663 --> 04:52.709
during the American Revolution.

04:52.709 --> 04:56.170
Was the brooch found
by Rick and Gary on Lot 21

04:56.170 --> 04:59.841
dropped there by one of these
visiting buccaneers?

04:59.841 --> 05:02.552
Or could it be one
of the jewels that,

05:02.552 --> 05:04.095
according to legend,

05:04.095 --> 05:06.221
was hidden on Oak Island
by the maid

05:06.221 --> 05:08.391
of Queen Marie Antoinette

05:08.391 --> 05:11.685
while she was fleeing
the bloody French Revolution?

05:14.105 --> 05:17.358
RICK:
It's quite an
intricate design, though.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.901
GARY:
 Yeah, a lot of work
 went into this.

05:19.901 --> 05:22.738
In my opinion,
what you really want is

05:22.738 --> 05:24.574
to get a date on it.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.701
Exactly, yeah.
Exactly.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.995
We've got two brooches
and two gemstones.

05:29.995 --> 05:33.499
Let's get this
and the other one to an expert

05:33.499 --> 05:35.000
and see if they're
somehow related.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.127
That would be interesting.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.211
Which would mean
there could be some more.

05:38.211 --> 05:40.130
Well, get out there and find a
whole chest full of that stuff.

05:40.130 --> 05:41.507
I knew you was gonna say that.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.966
Exactly.
I'm consistent.

05:42.966 --> 05:45.302
(laughter)

05:45.302 --> 05:47.387
All right, let's get back
to the field, then, Gary.

05:47.387 --> 05:50.891
-MARTY: Time to search for more.
-DAN: Good luck.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.233
NARRATOR:
 Later that same day,

06:00.233 --> 06:04.279
members of the Oak Island team
continue to oversee progress

06:04.279 --> 06:08.117
of an operation they hope will
allow them to actually see

06:08.117 --> 06:11.536
what lies hidden deep beneath
the island's surface.

06:12.829 --> 06:14.040
The process seems quite quick

06:14.040 --> 06:15.958
when you have all those guys
down there.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.668
Yeah, so we go
eight at a time here,

06:17.668 --> 06:20.754
-so they're gonna get going
in a couple seconds.
-Okay.

06:20.754 --> 06:24.509
NARRATOR:
 Working with representatives
 from Eagle Canada,

06:24.509 --> 06:27.302
a geophysical exploration
company specializing in

06:27.302 --> 06:29.055
cutting-edge technology,

06:29.055 --> 06:34.226
Rick, Marty and their partners
have decided to use a process

06:34.226 --> 06:37.730
called seismic scanning
to survey the area

06:37.730 --> 06:41.024
known as the Money Pit.

06:41.024 --> 06:44.278
The place where, 223 years ago,

06:44.278 --> 06:47.906
teenager Daniel McGinnis
and two of his friends found

06:47.906 --> 06:49.951
what they believed
to be the entrance

06:49.951 --> 06:54.413
to a mysterious
underground treasure vault.

06:54.413 --> 06:56.832
Using explosive charges,

06:56.832 --> 06:59.918
each armed with approximately
20 grams of dynamite,

06:59.918 --> 07:02.463
seismic scanning works
by setting off

07:02.463 --> 07:06.050
a series of relatively minor
explosions into the ground,

07:06.050 --> 07:08.386
and which, in turn,
send sound waves

07:08.386 --> 07:10.680
deep below the Earth's surface.

07:10.680 --> 07:14.100
These waves are then measured
by geophone receivers,

07:14.100 --> 07:16.726
up to a depth of 300 feet.

07:16.726 --> 07:20.064
The measurements are then
processed in such a way

07:20.064 --> 07:22.524
as to create a virtual
three-dimensional map

07:22.524 --> 07:25.153
of the area underground.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.740
CHARLES:
So how many have
you done already?

07:30.740 --> 07:33.661
We've done 225
so far this morning, so

07:33.661 --> 07:36.706
we're averaging
just over a hundred per hour.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.165
-Okay.
-So we got a good tempo
right now.

07:38.165 --> 07:40.877
We're excited. I mean,
this is the first time

07:40.877 --> 07:43.004
that anything like this has
ever been done on Oak Island.

07:45.505 --> 07:47.716
NARRATOR:
 Although larger
 seismic explosions

07:47.716 --> 07:50.136
can map areas miles
beneath the surface,

07:50.136 --> 07:54.014
the testing being conducted on
Oak Island has been calibrated

07:54.014 --> 07:58.853
to create a map of an area some
150 to 200 feet below ground.

08:01.021 --> 08:03.608
If successful, it is the team's
hope that the map created

08:03.608 --> 08:06.735
will reveal not only
natural voids,

08:06.735 --> 08:10.156
but ones that are man-made,
such as secret tunnels,

08:10.156 --> 08:13.701
and possibly the location
of a legendary treasure vault.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.331
If that data
can be as good or better

08:18.331 --> 08:20.415
as the 2-D, uh, line test,

08:20.415 --> 08:22.375
we'll, uh...
we'll be in business.

08:22.375 --> 08:24.086
Well, I know I speak
for all the guys that

08:24.086 --> 08:26.172
we're really looking forward
to the results here.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.257
-Oh, yeah.
-And as Dan always said,

08:28.257 --> 08:30.468
you can't look underground.
So you guys

08:30.468 --> 08:32.635
are giving us
that opportunity

08:32.635 --> 08:34.721
-to look underground here.
-Yeah.

08:44.481 --> 08:48.818
NARRATOR:
 As the seismic testing
 continues at the Money Pit,

08:48.818 --> 08:52.907
area archeologist Laird Niven
makes his way

08:52.907 --> 08:54.115
to the Oak Island
visitors center,

08:54.115 --> 08:56.494
where Rick and Marty Lagina

08:56.494 --> 08:59.580
are eager to show him
their latest discovery.

09:02.582 --> 09:03.918
-Oh, here he is.
-Hello!
-Here's the man of the hour.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.336
-Hey, Laird.
-How are you guys?

09:06.336 --> 09:08.129
-So, we've been busy.
-Okay.

09:08.129 --> 09:11.509
Lots 21 and 22
have been cleared off,

09:11.509 --> 09:13.635
so I'm finally able to

09:13.635 --> 09:15.929
-swing a detector in there.
-Right.

09:15.929 --> 09:20.393
And we got a nice little tone,

09:20.393 --> 09:23.270
and this pops out first,
doesn't it?

09:26.816 --> 09:28.275
Wow.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.197
It's a little pin.

09:34.197 --> 09:35.740
Seen anything like it?

09:35.740 --> 09:36.993
No?

09:36.993 --> 09:39.787
No. We don't get
a lot of jewelry.

09:39.787 --> 09:40.913
-We don't tend to.
-You don't?

09:40.913 --> 09:42.956
-No.
-We would really like to know.

09:42.956 --> 09:45.042
If you've never seen
one of those,

09:45.042 --> 09:47.086
an example of that,
that's very curious.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.461
No.

09:50.213 --> 09:54.134
It's perhaps significant
that Laird says

09:54.134 --> 09:56.636
that jewelry
is not often found.

09:56.636 --> 10:00.057
And he's here in Nova Scotia
in his archaeological dig,

10:00.057 --> 10:02.643
so that means there's
something special about this.

10:02.643 --> 10:06.062
We're finding things here
that he doesn't normally find.

10:06.062 --> 10:08.024
But it's pretty cool, isn't it?

10:08.024 --> 10:10.109
-It is.
-I mean, any idea?

10:10.109 --> 10:12.278
It is a lighter metal,
isn't it?

10:12.278 --> 10:14.029
Yeah.

10:14.029 --> 10:18.533
LAIRD:
And they gilded
the receptacle here.

10:18.533 --> 10:21.703
NARRATOR:
 Gilded? As in gold?

10:21.703 --> 10:24.831
Dating back over 5,000 years

10:24.831 --> 10:27.751
to the time of the ancient
Egyptians,

10:27.751 --> 10:31.713
gilding is a technique by which
thin layers of genuine gold,

10:31.713 --> 10:33.716
sometimes called gold leaf,

10:33.716 --> 10:37.635
are applied to an item,
such as an ornate picture frame

10:37.635 --> 10:40.306
or a piece of jewelry.

10:40.306 --> 10:44.809
If the brooch discovered
on Lot 21 is, in fact, gold,

10:44.809 --> 10:47.520
it could be
the first object of jewelry

10:47.520 --> 10:49.440
containing this precious metal

10:49.440 --> 10:51.024
that Rick and Marty
have discovered

10:51.024 --> 10:55.321
in their 12 years spent looking
for treasure on Oak Island.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.365
LAIRD:
Very interesting.

10:58.365 --> 11:01.034
-I would say, "Holy shmoly!"
-(laughter)

11:01.034 --> 11:03.453
Yeah, it's kind of
off the charts for us, you know?

11:03.453 --> 11:06.248
It's not...
This is completely unexpected.

11:06.248 --> 11:08.542
Yep. Would you recommend
more testing?

11:08.542 --> 11:11.294
Finding someone from
a religious artifact background

11:11.294 --> 11:13.422
-to look at it?
-Well, yeah,

11:13.422 --> 11:15.341
I don't think you can,
you can overstudy it.

11:15.341 --> 11:18.844
Okay. What else?

11:18.844 --> 11:20.221
We need to follow up
on the leads

11:20.221 --> 11:22.764
regarding looking
at both brooches.

11:22.764 --> 11:25.558
-Yeah.
-And I'll try and keep you
even busier.

11:25.558 --> 11:27.352
-Excellent.
-Excellent.

11:27.352 --> 11:29.230
Just, uh, just
getting warmed up.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.605
All right, Laird, it's gonna
be a great summer.

11:30.605 --> 11:32.441
-It's gonna be a great summer.
-Yeah, I can't...

11:32.441 --> 11:33.775
-You know,
I'm looking forward to it.
-See you later, man.

11:33.775 --> 11:35.193
-Thanks for the help.
-Thanks a lot.

11:35.193 --> 11:37.571
-Cheers, mate.
-Cheers.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.751
NARRATOR:
 The next day,

11:51.751 --> 11:55.380
after making their exciting
discovery on Lot 21,

11:55.380 --> 11:59.009
Rick Lagina and Gary Drayton
welcome representatives

11:59.009 --> 12:03.179
from Brycon Construction
and Irving Equipment, Limited.

12:03.179 --> 12:05.765
They have come to make
the final preparations

12:05.765 --> 12:08.601
for what promises
to be the most ambitious

12:08.601 --> 12:11.938
and technologically advanced
operation ever attempted...

12:11.938 --> 12:13.023
Mike, how you doing?

12:13.023 --> 12:14.984
...in the 223 year-long history

12:14.984 --> 12:17.778
of the Oak Island
treasure hunt:

12:17.778 --> 12:22.158
the installation of a 25-foot
deep metal cofferdam

12:22.158 --> 12:24.994
off the coast of Smith's Cove.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.455
When completed,
the encircled area

12:27.455 --> 12:29.831
will be drained
and then excavated

12:29.831 --> 12:32.625
in an effort to find
the elusive flood tunnels

12:32.625 --> 12:37.298
and, perhaps, a direct entrance
to the Oak Island Money Pit.

12:37.298 --> 12:41.469
But before construction
of the cofferdam can begin,

12:41.469 --> 12:44.679
a new access road and platform
must be laid out

12:44.679 --> 12:46.849
to allow
for the massive equipment,

12:46.849 --> 12:50.311
including a 300-ton crane
to be transported

12:50.311 --> 12:52.395
down to the beach area.

12:52.395 --> 12:56.900
That crane is the biggest item
that will have to be moved down.

12:56.900 --> 12:59.403
And, of course,
we'll have to track out

12:59.403 --> 13:04.073
so we have to seriously
reconfigure the path

13:04.073 --> 13:07.035
from 10-X down to Smith's Cove.

13:07.035 --> 13:10.413
And by serious,
I mean quite serious.

13:10.413 --> 13:13.500
Okay, well, uh,
I think everybody knows

13:13.500 --> 13:15.001
what we need to do.

13:15.001 --> 13:17.837
I think, you've all been
communicating.

13:17.837 --> 13:21.299
The whole idea
is to get your gear,

13:21.299 --> 13:24.010
Irving's gear,
down to Smith's Cove

13:24.010 --> 13:27.431
-and get that sheet pile
and the crane pad in. Right?
-Yep.

13:27.431 --> 13:30.308
And then, as far as
Brycon is concerned, you know,

13:30.308 --> 13:32.019
you're gonna be bringing
in a lot of material.

13:32.019 --> 13:35.438
-Yeah, we got about
175 loads coming in.
-RICK: Oh.

13:35.438 --> 13:37.357
And then, as far as your work,

13:37.357 --> 13:39.400
you're gonna be starting
from somewhere up in this area?

13:39.400 --> 13:42.779
-Or where?
-We're gonna start right up...
right about that grass.

13:42.779 --> 13:44.572
Okay.

13:44.572 --> 13:47.493
So, uh, gentlemen,
welcome to Lift Lab.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.036
Here we have with us
our engineering folks,

13:49.036 --> 13:50.245
as well as some of the folks

13:50.245 --> 13:51.663
-from our pile driving
department.
-Okay.

13:51.663 --> 13:54.290
NARRATOR:
 Two weeks ago, Rick,

13:54.290 --> 13:57.544
Craig Tester
and Dave Blankenship

13:57.544 --> 14:01.090
traveled to the headquarters
of Irving Equipment, Limited

14:01.090 --> 14:02.924
in St. John, New Brunswick.

14:02.924 --> 14:06.928
There they were presented
with a 3-D hologram design

14:06.928 --> 14:08.681
for a massive cofferdam.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.015
Look at the amount of earth
we have to deal with.

14:11.015 --> 14:14.562
-It's intimidating.
-Yeah, it is a big structure.

14:14.562 --> 14:18.941
NARRATOR:
 Once completed,
 a nearly 525-foot-wide,

14:18.941 --> 14:22.778
watertight steel wall
will allow the Oak Island team

14:22.778 --> 14:25.489
to fully drain and excavate
Smith's Cove.

14:25.489 --> 14:28.325
This will make it possible
for the team to dig up

14:28.325 --> 14:32.328
any important artifacts
or evidence of treasure.

14:32.328 --> 14:35.582
They also hope
to locate and shut off

14:35.582 --> 14:37.793
the box drain flood system

14:37.793 --> 14:41.297
believed to feed seawater
into the Money Pit.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.923
My hope has always been

14:43.923 --> 14:46.302
that even though the searchers

14:46.302 --> 14:48.511
over two and
a quarter centuries

14:48.511 --> 14:51.974
did highly disruptive
search agendas in Smith Cove,

14:51.974 --> 14:54.934
my hope is that a small section

14:54.934 --> 14:57.605
of the so-called box drains
yet survives.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.940
And I would love
to lay eyes on that.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.942
Once this process gets all done,

15:02.942 --> 15:04.611
what's your timing look like?

15:04.611 --> 15:09.033
Uh, we're thinking
probably a week and half.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.784
Aside from that, I think you
guys got your marching orders

15:11.784 --> 15:14.120
and if there is anything
we can do, you-you let us know.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.123
-Fair enough?
-Yep.
-That's no problem.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.625
All right, gentlemen,
good luck.

15:22.254 --> 15:25.798
NARRATOR:
 As the team from
 Brycon Construction

15:25.798 --> 15:28.217
begins work on a new road
to Smith's Cove,

15:28.217 --> 15:32.221
Rick, Marty and members
of the Oak Island team

15:32.221 --> 15:34.350
gather at the
Mug and Anchor Pub

15:34.350 --> 15:36.518
in the nearby town
of Mahone Bay.

15:36.518 --> 15:38.019
Hey, Guys.

15:38.019 --> 15:40.480
-Hey.
-DAVE: Hey, Marty.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.399
-Started without us, huh? Again?
-Again.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.234
-Well, you know,
you know how it goes.
-Yeah, I do.

15:44.234 --> 15:48.072
-(laughs)
-We're just talking
about my favorite subject:

15:48.072 --> 15:51.075
-metal detecting.
-Mm. And what'd you figure out?

15:51.075 --> 15:54.702
-That it's been going good.
-MARTY: Yeah.

15:54.702 --> 15:56.288
Can we talk about the brooch?

15:56.288 --> 15:58.164
Yeah, that took me by surprise.
I mean...

15:58.164 --> 16:01.000
But those brooches
are a good sign, because

16:01.000 --> 16:02.711
if you're looking
for treasure on Oak Island,

16:02.711 --> 16:05.673
it isn't just going to be coins.
You would imagine

16:05.673 --> 16:07.841
-there'd be a lot of jewelry.
-MARTY: Yeah.

16:07.841 --> 16:11.095
-But what it indicates
is wealth on the island.
-Yes.

16:11.095 --> 16:15.682
As regards the brooches,
we are, uh, going to Calgary.

16:15.682 --> 16:18.686
We've located a gemologist,

16:18.686 --> 16:21.312
someone highly qualified,
has an incredible pedigree.

16:21.312 --> 16:25.442
And he's an expert
in the study of jewelry.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.985
And, uh, hopefully,
he can give us some insight,

16:27.985 --> 16:31.572
tell you whether or not
you're really onto something.

16:31.572 --> 16:33.616
Okay, so the old guys
are off to Calgary

16:33.616 --> 16:35.369
for some answers
and some revelations.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.370
We're going to find out
about the brooches.

16:37.370 --> 16:39.581
The rest of you, carry on.
Hold down the fort.

16:39.581 --> 16:42.125
-To the hunt!
-Cheers.

16:50.049 --> 16:52.469
MARTY: Well, Dave, what do
Wh you think of Calgary, man? ?

16:52.469 --> 16:53.636
DAVE:
 It looks nice, so far,

16:53.636 --> 16:55.389
what I've seen of it.

16:55.389 --> 16:58.433
NARRATOR: Having traveled some
 3,000 miles west of Oak Island

16:58.433 --> 17:01.602
to the city of Calgary
in Alberta, Canada,

17:01.602 --> 17:04.355
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,

17:04.355 --> 17:06.900
along with Dave Blankenship,
are heading

17:06.900 --> 17:09.068
to the Alberta College
of Art and Design

17:09.068 --> 17:11.238
to have the two
gemstone brooches,

17:11.238 --> 17:13.906
each discovered on the western
end of the island,

17:13.906 --> 17:17.161
professionally examined
and compared.

17:17.161 --> 17:20.873
You know, I'm always on about
timing things, a timeline.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.165
I'm hoping Charles
can render an opinion.

17:23.165 --> 17:26.295
My hope is that it predates
searcher activity.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.297
MARTY:
Well, let's see what he says.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.840
-Now, look, we all agreed it was
worth a trip, right, Dave?
-Yep.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.093
We'll find out
how spendable they are.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.802
(laughs)
Of course.

17:34.802 --> 17:37.597
MARTY:
 We are going to see
 a preeminent gemologist.

17:37.597 --> 17:41.101
His name is Charles Lewton-Brain

17:41.101 --> 17:44.480
and we're excited to see what
he thinks these stones are.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.647
Here we go.

17:46.647 --> 17:49.484
Composition, origin, date,

17:49.484 --> 17:52.237
all the things that
we're usually looking for

17:52.237 --> 17:54.948
in Rick's information hunt
and in the treasure hunt.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.702
-RICK: Charles, I believe?
-MARTY: Charles?

17:59.702 --> 18:01.163
I'm Rick.
Nice to finally meet you.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.248
-I'm Marty.
Nice to meet you, sir.
-Hi, Marty.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.794
NARRATOR: Charles Lewton-Brain
 is a professional artist,

18:06.794 --> 18:10.130
gemologist and master goldsmith
who has also been an instructor

18:10.130 --> 18:11.882
at a number
of Canadian universities

18:11.882 --> 18:14.675
for more than 30 years.

18:14.675 --> 18:17.554
So, you know,
we've got these two items

18:17.554 --> 18:19.222
-that we found on Oak Island.
-Right.

18:19.222 --> 18:20.891
And, uh, we would really like

18:20.891 --> 18:22.683
to see what you can
tell us about them.

18:22.683 --> 18:24.685
CHARLES L.:
Huh.

18:24.685 --> 18:27.064
NARRATOR: In preparation
 for today's visit,

18:27.064 --> 18:29.525
the two gemstones
have been carefully removed

18:29.525 --> 18:31.652
from their settings
so that each

18:31.652 --> 18:33.528
can be thoroughly examined.

18:33.528 --> 18:36.365
CHARLES L.:
We have a large, red gem.

18:36.365 --> 18:41.702
When it was found, anything I
should understand about context?

18:41.702 --> 18:46.500
As you know, it was found
on Oak Island last year.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.710
It came out pretty much
as you see it there.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.171
Okay, so I placed the, uh, gem

18:51.171 --> 18:53.382
into the video microscope.

18:53.382 --> 18:56.175
NARRATOR:
 To make a visual assessment
 of the stones,

18:56.175 --> 19:00.430
Mr. Lewton-Brain
will use a variety of tools,

19:00.430 --> 19:03.349
including a digital
video microscope

19:03.349 --> 19:08.355
which can magnify an object up
to 220 times its original size,

19:08.355 --> 19:11.232
as well as make recordings
in high definition.

19:11.232 --> 19:13.527
CHARLES L.:
You can see the facets--

19:13.527 --> 19:16.946
-they don't meet perfectly.
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

19:16.946 --> 19:20.409
And, so, definitely
hand-cut, not machine-cut.

19:20.409 --> 19:23.036
And we do have
a lot of surface damage.

19:23.036 --> 19:26.789
I can also see
a number of scratches.

19:26.789 --> 19:28.416
They're sharp in nature.

19:28.416 --> 19:31.169
They're not blurred
and rounded.

19:31.169 --> 19:34.548
Let's try this.

19:37.174 --> 19:41.888
I'm getting a refractive index
of over 1.7.

19:41.888 --> 19:43.723
Which means?

19:43.723 --> 19:47.227
-Ruby is 1.74.
-Oh.

19:47.227 --> 19:51.147
So, perhaps we should look
at the other microscope.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.949
And there's cracks and grooves,

20:00.949 --> 20:04.493
but they're sharp cracks
and grooves.

20:04.493 --> 20:07.247
-That good or bad?
-CHARLES L.: That's good.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.790
Well, if you want it to be
a gemstone, it's good.

20:09.790 --> 20:14.587
But I would say, so far,
consistent with garnet.

20:16.673 --> 20:17.924
It's a pretty stone.

20:17.924 --> 20:20.801
-Good.
-(laughs)

20:20.801 --> 20:23.055
-We got us a gemstone.
-Yes, you do.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.097
NARRATOR: The confirmation
 that the object

20:25.097 --> 20:28.101
discovered last year
on Lot Eight is, in fact,

20:28.101 --> 20:32.439
a semiprecious stone garnet
offers exciting news.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.776
It also supports a previous
professional evaluation

20:35.776 --> 20:40.655
that suggested the brooch could
be more than 300 years old,

20:40.655 --> 20:45.076
long before the discovery
of the Money Pit in 1795.

20:45.076 --> 20:47.996
MARTY:
Can we take a look,
then, at the other one?

20:47.996 --> 20:49.789
This is the most recent find.

20:49.789 --> 20:51.791
CHARLES L.:
Right, so,

20:51.791 --> 20:53.876
in order to know
a bit more about it,

20:53.876 --> 20:57.673
what can you tell me about
the location that it was found?

20:57.673 --> 21:00.968
It was almost
a peat-like environment,

21:00.968 --> 21:04.512
uh, but not wet,
not-not soaked, certainly.

21:04.512 --> 21:07.307
The depths were
in the neighborhood

21:07.307 --> 21:10.227
-of ten to 12 inches.
-Okay.

21:10.227 --> 21:13.521
Um, it came out pretty much
as you see it there.

21:13.521 --> 21:14.981
CHARLES L.:
Well, let's just see here.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.318
MARTY:
 Oh, there we go.

21:19.318 --> 21:21.488
CHARLES L.:
 The facet junctions-- that is

21:21.488 --> 21:24.907
the sharp points between the
planes-- they're quite worn.

21:24.907 --> 21:28.619
That implies a softer material.

21:28.619 --> 21:30.372
There is an inclusion.

21:30.372 --> 21:33.500
An inclusion means something
inside the stone.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.670
And that would be a bubble?

21:36.670 --> 21:39.381
Let's see if I can increase
my magnification.

21:39.381 --> 21:42.092
Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

21:42.092 --> 21:47.180
The-the inclusion is made up
out of many, many tiny bubbles.

21:47.180 --> 21:52.144
And so, I think we're pretty
sure this is glass.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.980
-RICK: I see.
-MARTY:
That's maybe bad news, then.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.106
RICK:
 When Charles tells us
 that he believes

21:57.106 --> 21:59.901
the stone in the new brooch
is glass,

21:59.901 --> 22:02.695
you know, of course,
there's an initial, "Oh."

22:02.695 --> 22:04.405
You know, "that's not good."

22:04.405 --> 22:06.407
I wanted it to be a ruby.

22:06.407 --> 22:08.660
You know? We're searching
for treasure, here.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.038
That would have been
a, you know, a precious stone.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.539
So yeah, initial reaction
is disappointment.

22:13.539 --> 22:18.127
So, definitive glass,
but also definitive hand-made.

22:18.127 --> 22:19.546
Not modern.

22:19.546 --> 22:21.298
RICK:
When you say not modern...

22:21.298 --> 22:26.219
Well, glass gems have been
around at least, uh, 500 years.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.971
Leaded glass has been used

22:28.971 --> 22:31.807
a long time because, um,

22:31.807 --> 22:34.060
the light passes
through it well.

22:34.060 --> 22:36.438
And, again,
that's why chandeliers

22:36.438 --> 22:39.900
-are-are made
out of leaded glass.
-What about the red color?

22:39.900 --> 22:42.109
-Is there anything
to make from that?
-AXEL: Well, uh,

22:42.109 --> 22:44.988
in the color red, the formulas
for making red glass

22:44.988 --> 22:49.034
have been lost and found,
and lost and found again,

22:49.034 --> 22:51.077
-several times through history.
-MARTY: Lost, how?

22:51.077 --> 22:53.163
How would you lose such a thing?

22:53.163 --> 22:56.791
Uh, well, glass people
were extremely secretive.

22:56.791 --> 23:00.336
Each family
that was working glass

23:00.336 --> 23:04.257
would have their own little book
of recipes, sometimes in code.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.719
NARRATOR:
 Secret recipes...

23:07.719 --> 23:09.096
written in code?

23:09.096 --> 23:11.515
Over the years,
many researchers

23:11.515 --> 23:13.432
and historians have theorized

23:13.432 --> 23:16.019
that the people
behind the Oak Island mystery

23:16.019 --> 23:19.355
were likely members
of an elite secret society.

23:19.355 --> 23:22.526
Among the most prominent
of these organizations

23:22.526 --> 23:24.152
is the Rosicrucians,

23:24.152 --> 23:27.029
a group of 16th century
European intellectuals

23:27.029 --> 23:30.826
who are believed to have been
led by Sir Francis Bacon,

23:30.826 --> 23:33.828
and whose symbol was a blood
red, or "rosy cross,"

23:33.828 --> 23:38.040
hence, the name Rosicrucians.

23:38.040 --> 23:41.169
Could the blood-red stones
that were found on Oak Island

23:41.169 --> 23:44.506
be linked in some way
to this secret organization,

23:44.506 --> 23:47.299
or perhaps
to the Knights Templar,

23:47.299 --> 23:51.137
a medieval order of warrior
monks who wore red crosses,

23:51.137 --> 23:55.267
and whose traditions
and rituals were later adopted

23:55.267 --> 23:57.769
by the secretive fraternity
of master builders

23:57.769 --> 24:00.396
known as the Freemasons.

24:00.396 --> 24:03.650
Secret societies
keep their secrets well.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.818
That's why they're
secret societies.

24:05.818 --> 24:08.154
Might there be a connection
or an importance

24:08.154 --> 24:11.074
in their initiation rites
or in their emblems

24:11.074 --> 24:15.077
or in their symbology, they
used the color red extensively?

24:15.077 --> 24:17.038
Certainly, there is
a possible connection.

24:17.038 --> 24:20.291
-All right, so, perhaps we
should look at the other part...
-Okay.

24:20.291 --> 24:22.794
Let's look-let's look
at the setting itself.

24:22.794 --> 24:25.505
-If we can impose on you longer.
-Oh, yeah.

24:27.339 --> 24:29.092
Okay, it's a brooch.

24:29.092 --> 24:32.052
Might as well
try our digital camera.

24:32.052 --> 24:36.974
The part I'm really interested
in is the cord.

24:36.974 --> 24:40.228
That is, the wire
that surrounds the bezel,

24:40.228 --> 24:43.105
the bezel is what holds
the stone in.

24:43.105 --> 24:46.358
And so, if you look
at this cord, or wire,

24:46.358 --> 24:50.363
you can see that there's
a spiral nature to it.

24:50.363 --> 24:53.616
And you can see that there are
these diagonal lines on here.

24:53.616 --> 24:56.036
-Here.
-This is not

24:56.036 --> 25:00.414
your ordinary, old brooch
found in the ground.

25:00.414 --> 25:02.291
That is a super ancient way
of making wire.

25:07.422 --> 25:09.590
CHARLES L.:
If you look at this wire,

25:09.590 --> 25:13.510
-you can see that there's
a spiral nature to it.
-Yes.

25:13.510 --> 25:15.512
CHARLES L.:
It's called block twisting,

25:15.512 --> 25:18.224
and this is the sign
of ancient jewelry.

25:18.224 --> 25:20.101
Interesting.

25:20.101 --> 25:24.980
NARRATOR:
 Dating back to as early
 as the 22nd century B.C.,

25:24.980 --> 25:26.942
in the period known
as the Bronze Age,

25:26.942 --> 25:30.278
the ancient technique
known as block twisting

25:30.278 --> 25:33.280
was common in the production
of the gold wire

25:33.280 --> 25:35.241
used in making jewelry.

25:35.241 --> 25:38.118
It was accomplished
by hammering a metal ingot

25:38.118 --> 25:40.247
into a thin rod and twisting it

25:40.247 --> 25:42.707
to form
a tight braid-like wire.

25:42.707 --> 25:45.669
The metal thread would then
be rolled between two pieces

25:45.669 --> 25:49.548
of hard wood to create
a uniform diameter.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.967
So the fact that
it's what appears

25:51.967 --> 25:54.594
to be a block-twisted wire--

25:54.594 --> 25:56.805
this implies age.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.015
Mainly because of that wire.

25:59.015 --> 26:03.560
Mainly because of that wire.
That wire is highly unusual.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.938
How old?
I mean...

26:04.938 --> 26:07.816
1340s drawplates,
so prior to then,

26:07.816 --> 26:11.027
the only wires we've got are
made in some manner like this.

26:11.027 --> 26:13.363
-Potentially older than 1330?
-Older?

26:13.363 --> 26:14.446
Yep.

26:16.282 --> 26:18.117
NARRATOR:
 If Charles Lewton-Brain's
 assessment

26:18.117 --> 26:21.663
is correct, the brooch
is the team's first artifact

26:21.663 --> 26:23.707
that has been authenticated
as being made

26:23.707 --> 26:28.377
as early as the 14th century,
or even earlier.

26:28.377 --> 26:31.213
This would make it
some 300 years older

26:31.213 --> 26:34.217
than the 17th century
English and Spanish coins

26:34.217 --> 26:38.887
that have been found on Oak
Island over the past six years.

26:38.887 --> 26:41.891
I have been completely
unwilling to believe

26:41.891 --> 26:45.686
that what happened on Oak Island
happened pre-1400s.

26:45.686 --> 26:48.856
Completely unwilling to believe
it. And now you got this.

26:48.856 --> 26:51.483
It looks like
this could be a brooch

26:51.483 --> 26:53.819
from the 1300s or before,

26:53.819 --> 26:55.404
so with a bit
of a question mark,

26:55.404 --> 26:57.699
and with a bit of uncertainty,
yeah, it opens up

26:57.699 --> 26:59.992
all kinds of avenues,
and changes, potentially,

26:59.992 --> 27:03.038
my thinking about
what happened here.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.663
What about the overall design?

27:04.663 --> 27:06.124
Does that give you
any clues at all?

27:06.124 --> 27:09.085
Nothing specific,

27:09.085 --> 27:12.505
beyond the use of spirals,
which many cultures have done.

27:12.505 --> 27:15.842
It places it
as kind of crude work.

27:15.842 --> 27:19.596
Um, countryside work, perhaps.

27:19.596 --> 27:21.597
I would say European, for sure.

27:21.597 --> 27:24.058
RICK:
So, would there be
databases for that,

27:24.058 --> 27:26.478
a way to proceed
with further testing?

27:26.478 --> 27:29.439
The British Gemological Society
in London.

27:29.439 --> 27:33.692
Um, uh, they might
have some databases.

27:33.692 --> 27:35.694
-The data's out there somewhere.
-It is.

27:35.694 --> 27:39.199
Well, thank you for bringing it.
It's been, um, a treat.

27:39.199 --> 27:40.657
It's been interesting
for us, too.

27:40.657 --> 27:43.869
Extremely. Well, listen,
thank you very much.

27:43.869 --> 27:45.372
-Absolute, absolute pleasure.
-Thank you very much.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.123
Absolute pleasure.

27:47.123 --> 27:49.166
On to the next task.

27:56.590 --> 27:57.717
I think this was perfect.

27:57.717 --> 27:59.134
NARRATOR:
 The next day,

27:59.134 --> 28:01.554
as Rick Lagina
supervises the building

28:01.554 --> 28:04.098
of the new road leading
to Smith's Cove...

28:04.098 --> 28:08.060
I'm gonna predict
that it is pre-1840.

28:08.060 --> 28:10.563
...Marty Lagina joins
his son Alex

28:10.563 --> 28:14.150
and his friend and business
partner Craig Tester

28:14.150 --> 28:16.568
as they travel
some 50 miles northeast

28:16.568 --> 28:19.239
to St. Mary's University
in the city of Halifax.

28:19.239 --> 28:20.615
Thanks, Craig.

28:20.615 --> 28:22.450
NARRATOR:
 They are eager to find out

28:22.450 --> 28:25.787
if the antique brooch
that was discovered on Lot 21

28:25.787 --> 28:30.165
is, in fact,
partially made of gold.

28:30.165 --> 28:32.251
Dr. Brosseau.

28:32.251 --> 28:33.545
Nice to see you, Christa.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.212
Welcome down
to the microscope lab.

28:35.212 --> 28:36.839
-Hello.
-Xiang, good to see you.

28:36.839 --> 28:38.924
-Good seeing you.
-Hi, how are you?
-Good.

28:38.924 --> 28:41.094
We have something here
I think you are gonna find

28:41.094 --> 28:42.679
quite interesting, actually.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.596
Piece of jewelry of some sort.

28:44.596 --> 28:47.808
NARRATOR:
 Dr. Christa Brosseau
 is an associate professor

28:47.808 --> 28:51.813
of chemistry, with expertise in
the field of electrochemistry

28:51.813 --> 28:53.440
as well as the study of metals

28:53.440 --> 28:55.525
and their chemical
compositions.

28:55.525 --> 28:59.695
Today, she is joined by
her colleague, Dr. Xiang Yang.

28:59.695 --> 29:01.780
CHRISTA:
Very nice.

29:01.780 --> 29:03.199
-MARTY: Pretty, isn't it?
-CHRISTA: Yeah.

29:03.199 --> 29:04.951
MARTY:
The brooch was found this year,

29:04.951 --> 29:08.163
and we've had it looked at
by a gemologist already,

29:08.163 --> 29:10.789
and it did appear
that there were places

29:10.789 --> 29:13.625
-that had gold.
-Okay. Where did you guys
find this?

29:13.625 --> 29:15.836
MARTY:
Kind of the western end
of the island.

29:15.836 --> 29:17.297
CHRISTA:
It's in really good condition.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.798
Have a look, and we'll see
what your machine says.

29:19.798 --> 29:23.595
NARRATOR:
 Using a high-powered
 scanning electron microscope,

29:23.595 --> 29:27.390
Doctors Brosseau and Yang will
be able to magnify the brooch

29:27.390 --> 29:31.144
up to tens of thousands
of times its actual size.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.605
They also will be able
to examine

29:33.605 --> 29:35.315
its chemical composition

29:35.315 --> 29:37.733
and determine whether
it's made of gold

29:37.733 --> 29:40.487
or any other precious metals.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.113
CRAIG:
Now, is there any manganese

29:42.113 --> 29:44.156
in what you're seeing there?

29:44.156 --> 29:46.159
CHRISTA:
No, that's just copper,

29:46.159 --> 29:49.244
zinc, typical brass.

29:51.122 --> 29:54.709
It's good to check,
because brass

29:54.709 --> 29:56.711
can often imitate gold
very well, right?

29:56.711 --> 29:58.880
Mm-hmm.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.173
-MARTY:
What are the lighter spots?
-Yeah, what I'm looking at--

30:01.173 --> 30:02.634
what are we seeing
that's bright?

30:02.634 --> 30:05.053
Is that
the potential gold, or...

30:05.053 --> 30:06.386
You know, right
in the very center.

30:06.386 --> 30:09.057
CHRISTA:
It could be.

30:09.057 --> 30:11.099
This is right under
where the stone was.

30:11.099 --> 30:13.102
This is the brightest... To the
naked eye, this is, by far,

30:13.102 --> 30:15.104
the brightest.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.980
Okay, well why don't we do
a composition

30:16.980 --> 30:19.526
on that brightest spot,
right underneath?

30:19.526 --> 30:21.152
-'Cause that's...
-Okay, I think we can do that.

30:24.404 --> 30:26.865
CHRISTA:
We'll be able
to tell in a minute.

30:26.865 --> 30:27.866
Okay.

30:36.625 --> 30:38.711
Should be good.

30:41.130 --> 30:45.093
So, the dark area here
is pure copper.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.052
That's interesting.

30:47.052 --> 30:50.097
But...

30:50.097 --> 30:51.682
-The bright area...
-Yeah?

30:51.682 --> 30:53.893
Gold.

30:53.893 --> 30:56.729
Well, how about that?
Gary can go do his gold dance.

30:56.729 --> 30:58.397
-He found some gold.
-You got gold.

30:58.397 --> 31:00.983
-You definitely
struck gold. Yep.
-(laughing)

31:00.983 --> 31:03.236
We struck gold.

31:06.990 --> 31:10.242
MARTY:
Yeah, I guess I'd have to say
that's the first piece

31:10.242 --> 31:12.578
of verified gold
found on the island.

31:12.578 --> 31:14.079
ALEX:
That's a first for us, right?

31:14.079 --> 31:15.707
It's a first for us, for sure.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.917
I think this would be
considered actual treasure.

31:18.917 --> 31:20.877
-Yeah.
-ALEX: All right.
-CRAIG: Yeah.

31:20.877 --> 31:23.213
Well, here's the deal:
we found treasure on Oak Island.

31:23.213 --> 31:24.673
Yeah. We did.

31:24.673 --> 31:26.550
-(whoops)
-We've been in it... (whoops)

31:26.550 --> 31:29.178
Woot, woot. And we've proven it
right here, in this lab today.

31:29.178 --> 31:31.888
-Excellent.
-So that's pretty cool.

31:31.888 --> 31:33.807
-Not bad.
-I mean, yeah.

31:33.807 --> 31:36.352
-That's a pretty good day.
-(chuckles)

31:36.352 --> 31:38.145
MARTY:
 The brooch that was
 found this year

31:38.145 --> 31:40.147
is motivating and exciting,

31:40.147 --> 31:41.982
'cause it's a real piece
of treasure.

31:41.982 --> 31:43.401
You just can't deny that.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.193
It's a piece of treasure,

31:45.193 --> 31:47.697
in the elaborate setting
found on Oak Island.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.531
This is just
the tip of the iceberg.

31:49.531 --> 31:51.992
There is more
that awaits us this year.

31:51.992 --> 31:55.163
-Now we need to bring in
the mother lode.
-Yeah.

31:55.163 --> 31:56.788
-Thank you very much, as always.
-Oh, you're welcome.

31:56.788 --> 31:58.708
-Xiang, a pleasure.
-Congratulations.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.626
I'm gonna pick up all kinds of
things to put in that machine.

32:00.626 --> 32:02.628
-Thanks.
-CHRISTA: Thanks, guys.

32:09.551 --> 32:12.846
NARRATOR: Returning to the
 island later that afternoon,

32:12.846 --> 32:16.058
Marty Lagina calls a meeting
in the war room.

32:16.058 --> 32:18.603
He is eager to share
the exciting news

32:18.603 --> 32:21.480
with his brother Rick
and members of their team.

32:21.480 --> 32:25.942
Guys, I am freshly back
from St. Mary's University.

32:25.942 --> 32:27.903
Craig and Alex and I
went up there,

32:27.903 --> 32:30.530
and I-I shouldn't be excited
about this, really,

32:30.530 --> 32:33.576
in a sense, but I am,
because, David...

32:35.452 --> 32:38.413
...this little gem
has gold on it.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.250
(chuckles)

32:41.250 --> 32:43.544
We have found our first gold
on Oak Island.

32:43.544 --> 32:45.672
DAVID:
I want more gold than that.

32:46.713 --> 32:48.548
Well, come on, man.

32:48.548 --> 32:50.425
-(laughter)
-Small victories, right?

32:50.425 --> 32:51.719
Yeah.

32:51.719 --> 32:53.096
MARTY:
You know, when, uh, Dr. Brosseau

32:53.096 --> 32:55.722
put the scanning electron
microscope on it

32:55.722 --> 32:59.059
and it came up "Au,"
you know, gold.

32:59.059 --> 33:00.603
I-I think that's pretty cool.

33:00.603 --> 33:03.980
NARRATOR:
For Rick, Marty and their team,

33:03.980 --> 33:07.317
the discovery of an actual
piece of golden treasure

33:07.317 --> 33:11.239
is a momentous development
in the 223-year history

33:11.239 --> 33:13.449
of the Oak Island
treasure hunt.

33:13.449 --> 33:17.452
It is also a major step forward
in their quest to prove

33:17.452 --> 33:19.497
that something
of even greater value

33:19.497 --> 33:23.041
may have been buried here
centuries ago.

33:23.041 --> 33:26.753
We had a gemologist look
at this in Calgary, too,

33:26.753 --> 33:30.799
and he thought
that there's one little style

33:30.799 --> 33:32.926
that's called block twist,

33:32.926 --> 33:34.761
which is the braided
around the gem.

33:34.761 --> 33:36.931
And he said
that went out of fashion

33:36.931 --> 33:41.394
as a method of doing things
in the 14th century.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.730
-Really?
-Yeah. So we keep getting

33:43.730 --> 33:45.940
some really odd potential dates.

33:45.940 --> 33:49.359
Now, this is not
a super quality gem piece,

33:49.359 --> 33:51.487
in that it's gold-plated,

33:51.487 --> 33:55.240
but it's gold,
and it could be very old.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.242
Yeah, absolutely.

33:57.242 --> 33:59.327
Yeah, but it occurs to me
that "old" and "gold"

33:59.327 --> 34:02.582
are two good words to use
if you're on Oak Island.

34:02.582 --> 34:05.250
Yeah, exactly.

34:05.250 --> 34:07.002
So we have this brooch,

34:07.002 --> 34:10.422
which could be a lot older
than we ever thought.

34:10.422 --> 34:14.927
We have the lead cross
not mined in North America.

34:14.927 --> 34:17.679
So these artifacts are pushing
us back farther in time

34:17.679 --> 34:20.099
than I ever thought
we would see here.

34:20.099 --> 34:21.851
Well, you know, Rick, I never
thought we'd be finding stuff

34:21.851 --> 34:23.893
from the 12 or 1300s.

34:23.893 --> 34:26.521
I can't say that I ever thought
that, as well, David,

34:26.521 --> 34:29.108
but we're finding answers.

34:29.108 --> 34:31.902
-Way back.
-Way back.

34:31.902 --> 34:34.864
NARRATOR:
 Could both the gold-plated
 brooch and the one

34:34.864 --> 34:38.784
containing the hand-cut garnet
be somehow connected?

34:38.784 --> 34:41.579
If so, could they have been
brought to the island

34:41.579 --> 34:44.456
by pirates sometime
in the 18th century,

34:44.456 --> 34:47.501
or possibly much earlier?

34:47.501 --> 34:51.630
As far as Rick, Marty and their
partners are concerned,

34:51.630 --> 34:54.382
as close as they are
to getting answers,

34:54.382 --> 34:57.552
the 223-year-old
Oak Island treasure hunt

34:57.552 --> 35:00.639
has only just begun.

35:00.639 --> 35:02.849
So, guys,
you're all up to speed,

35:02.849 --> 35:06.144
you all have all the data, we've
discussed where this might lead.

35:06.144 --> 35:08.396
I think we should get
back to actual work.

35:08.396 --> 35:11.317
Let's go.

35:11.317 --> 35:14.695
NARRATOR:
 Before another long day

35:14.695 --> 35:18.657
of both questions and answers
ends on Oak Island,

35:18.657 --> 35:21.661
Rick Lagina and Dan Henskee

35:21.661 --> 35:24.121
head over to the Money Pit area

35:24.121 --> 35:27.541
to check on
the seismic team's progress.

35:27.541 --> 35:29.126
-ALEX G.: Hey, guys.
-Hey.

35:29.126 --> 35:31.086
-It's a wrap.
-Really?

35:31.086 --> 35:32.838
-Absolutely.
-It's a wrap?

35:32.838 --> 35:34.673
Is that the celebratory, uh...

35:34.673 --> 35:36.842
-That was the last one.
-That was the last one?

35:36.842 --> 35:38.885
-It's officially in the books.
-Where's-where's my last one?

35:38.885 --> 35:41.681
-There you go. Yeah.
-I'll take it, I'll take it.

35:41.681 --> 35:42.931
-Program souvenir.
-That's fantastic, guys.

35:42.931 --> 35:45.601
You know, look,
we really appreciate it.

35:45.601 --> 35:50.731
I-I can't speak highly enough
about your team, yourselves.

35:50.731 --> 35:53.150
But here's the key:

35:53.150 --> 35:56.027
when are we going to Calgary?
When are we gonna see the data?

35:56.027 --> 35:57.737
Well, we got a push on it.

35:57.737 --> 35:59.364
We're really hoping
for a couple weeks.

35:59.364 --> 36:01.367
NARRATOR:
 The news that the seismic team

36:01.367 --> 36:03.202
has finished
collecting their data

36:03.202 --> 36:05.621
represents
an important milestone

36:05.621 --> 36:08.416
for Rick Lagina
and the Oak Island team.

36:08.416 --> 36:11.878
Once processed, the information
collected should produce

36:11.878 --> 36:14.297
a comprehensive,
three-dimensional map

36:14.297 --> 36:18.300
of the area, some 200 feet
below the surface.

36:18.300 --> 36:22.137
It should also reveal the
presence of possible tunnels

36:22.137 --> 36:24.389
and underground structures,

36:24.389 --> 36:28.603
potential hiding places
for a legendary treasure.

36:28.603 --> 36:31.606
I can't say thank you enough.

36:31.606 --> 36:34.608
My hope is that, you know,
when we do come to Calgary,

36:34.608 --> 36:37.737
you guys are gonna be able
to put a map down in front of us

36:37.737 --> 36:39.487
and say,
"Okay, here's your target.

36:39.487 --> 36:41.199
Here's what this is,
Here's what that is."

36:41.199 --> 36:44.076
I certainly think you, uh,
got some more believers here

36:44.076 --> 36:45.744
on the island
with our time here,

36:45.744 --> 36:48.581
and, uh, we can
give you guys some answers.

36:48.581 --> 36:51.791
Be careful about your wish that
you'll give us all the answers,

36:51.791 --> 36:53.753
'cause we won't want you back
with your geophones,

36:53.753 --> 36:55.795
we'll want you back
with shovels.

36:55.795 --> 36:57.840
(laughing)

36:57.840 --> 36:59.425
We can do that as well.

36:59.425 --> 37:01.135
All righty.
That'd be great, guys.

37:01.135 --> 37:02.719
Thank you very much.

37:02.719 --> 37:04.429
Let's go, Dan.

37:04.429 --> 37:13.146
DAN H.:
Yep.

37:13.146 --> 37:16.358
NARRATOR:
 With the new road
 to the beach completed,

37:16.358 --> 37:19.987
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina
are finally ready

37:19.987 --> 37:23.282
to break ground on this
summer's most ambitious

37:23.282 --> 37:26.117
and most eagerly
anticipated project...

37:27.994 --> 37:30.623
...the excavation
of Smith's Cove.

37:30.623 --> 37:35.001
Today the team
from Irving Equipment, Limited

37:35.001 --> 37:38.463
has begun delivering the heavy
machines and equipment

37:38.463 --> 37:40.298
that will be needed
in order to construct

37:40.298 --> 37:41.592
a massive steel cofferdam.

37:41.592 --> 37:44.094
(horn honking)

37:44.094 --> 37:46.514
They're here.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.139
Here we go.

37:52.268 --> 37:53.813
-Pretty remarkable,
isn't it, David?
-Yep.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.815
NARRATOR:
 Over the next few days,

37:55.815 --> 37:58.858
the team will assemble
a 300-ton crane

37:58.858 --> 38:01.862
at the Money Pit area,
before it can be staged

38:01.862 --> 38:03.405
on the nearby beach,

38:03.405 --> 38:07.159
where some 2,200 tons of earth
have been moved

38:07.159 --> 38:10.996
to build a perfectly flat
work surface.

38:10.996 --> 38:15.001
And in a couple days,
that'll be put together.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.876
-Yep.
-And roughly two,
three weeks from now,

38:16.876 --> 38:18.878
we'll be down at target depth.

38:18.878 --> 38:21.673
-It's cool.
-Just think how long
it took your father.

38:21.673 --> 38:24.260
-We didn't have
the technology, then.
-Exactly.

38:24.260 --> 38:26.929
NARRATOR:
 Once the crane is in place,

38:26.929 --> 38:28.931
construction can finally begin

38:28.931 --> 38:33.268
on the nearly 525-foot-long
watertight barrier.

38:33.268 --> 38:36.938
When it is completed, the ocean
water will be drained out,

38:36.938 --> 38:41.402
and then the entire area,
nearly 12,000 square-feet,

38:41.402 --> 38:43.528
will be excavated.

38:43.528 --> 38:46.699
This will allow the team
to uncover not only

38:46.699 --> 38:49.952
important artifacts such as
the mysterious lead cross

38:49.952 --> 38:53.039
discovered at Smith's Cove
last year,

38:53.039 --> 38:57.293
but also possible evidence of
an ancient flood tunnel system.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.378
RICK:
 Because of the find
 of the cross,

38:59.378 --> 39:02.380
we have to do
a very disciplined,

39:02.380 --> 39:05.467
archaeologically-driven dig,

39:05.467 --> 39:09.512
in order to see if there are
other similar artifacts.

39:12.599 --> 39:14.768
We've always thought that
there may be a treasure trove

39:14.768 --> 39:18.230
of information at Smith's Cove.

39:18.230 --> 39:21.317
At the end of this exercise,
we're going to know more about

39:21.317 --> 39:23.860
Smith's Cove than has
ever been known before.

39:23.860 --> 39:25.737
MARTY:
 It's a big operation.

39:25.737 --> 39:27.572
It's scary, in a sense,
it's daunting.

39:27.572 --> 39:29.324
And it's exciting.

39:29.324 --> 39:31.284
There's a story here.

39:31.284 --> 39:34.079
-Yep.
-And it's constantly
un-unraveling.

39:34.079 --> 39:37.248
-Yep.
-For me, the quest is really

39:37.248 --> 39:39.418
to find out what happened here,
long ago.

39:39.418 --> 39:42.630
And I hope that
there's answers down there.

39:42.630 --> 39:44.923
I do, too.

39:44.923 --> 39:47.510
NARRATOR:
 After a week that
 saw the discovery

39:47.510 --> 39:49.887
of an actual piece
of gold jewelry

39:49.887 --> 39:53.224
thought to be
nearly 700 years old,

39:53.224 --> 39:56.518
the Laginas and their partners
are more confident than ever

39:56.518 --> 39:58.436
that their decades of dreaming

39:58.436 --> 40:02.108
and years of searching
are finally paying off.

40:02.108 --> 40:05.360
But as they become
the first in a long line

40:05.360 --> 40:07.362
of Oak Island treasure hunters

40:07.362 --> 40:11.242
to actually look beneath the
surface, what will they find?

40:11.242 --> 40:14.994
Evidence of a vast network
of booby-trapped flood tunnels?

40:14.994 --> 40:17.123
An enormous, underground vault

40:17.123 --> 40:20.166
filled with pirate riches
or Templar gold?

40:20.166 --> 40:24.922
Or could they discover
secrets so sacred

40:24.922 --> 40:26.715
and so forbidden

40:26.715 --> 40:28.717
that they have been
fiercely guarded

40:28.717 --> 40:33.139
against any who might
dare to reveal them?

40:35.766 --> 40:38.978
Next Time
 on The Curse of Oak Island...

40:38.978 --> 40:41.646
MARTY:
 We're going to get a look
 at the seismic results.

40:41.646 --> 40:43.940
This is definitely
the largest anomaly.

40:43.940 --> 40:46.152
It is a confident structure,
whatever it is.

40:46.152 --> 40:48.237
Is that consistent
with a chamber?

40:48.237 --> 40:50.155
Yeah. It is.

40:50.155 --> 40:52.657
MARTY: Now we have a target, so
we need to drill it right away,

40:52.657 --> 40:54.326
find out what it is.

40:54.326 --> 40:57.746
TERRY: Wow, look at that.
This is a lot of wood here.

40:57.746 --> 40:58.998
MARTY:
 Maybe it is the old Money Pit.

40:58.998 --> 41:01.000
GARY:
Look at this! This is old.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.295
we're talking, like,
Templar old.
