Go, bread, go.
Toast it like you mean it.

00:08.759 --> 00:12.513
Uh-oh. Please tell me
she's not coaching the food.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.635
Come on, put your back
into it, sourdough.

00:14.635 --> 00:16.477

00:16.477 --> 00:19.520
Oh, yeah, she's all up

00:19.520 --> 00:21.522
It's that time
of the year again.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.484
Georgie has four seasons:

00:23.484 --> 00:24.645
basketball season,

00:24.645 --> 00:26.357
soccer season,
 softball season,

00:26.357 --> 00:28.319
and the one
 we dread the most.

00:28.319 --> 00:30.911
BOTH: In-between
seasons season.

00:30.911 --> 00:32.613
I should've known.

00:32.613 --> 00:34.655
This morning, she
challenged me to a floss-off.

00:34.655 --> 00:36.537
The only winner there
is her dentist.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.959
We're out of bread.
Can you toast crackers?

00:38.959 --> 00:40.961
Get ready, crackers.
You're goin' in.

00:40.961 --> 00:43.374
Georgie without a sport
is like me

00:43.374 --> 00:44.625
without my invention bag.

00:44.625 --> 00:47.668
- A monster.
- I was going to say lost.

00:47.668 --> 00:49.260
Right. Lost.

00:49.260 --> 00:50.631
Did I not say lost?

00:50.631 --> 00:53.344
There must be some sport
recruiting now.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.845
What about archery?

00:54.845 --> 00:56.517
A sharp spear
flying through the air.

00:56.517 --> 00:58.099
Georgie.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.560
High dive?

00:59.560 --> 01:00.731
High and dive.

01:00.731 --> 01:03.564
Both of those words
say body cast.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.986
Golf tryouts
are coming up.
What about that?

01:05.986 --> 01:07.528
That could work.

01:07.528 --> 01:09.690
I mean, mini golf
is the only sport

01:09.690 --> 01:11.492
where she hasn't hurt
herself or someone else.

01:11.492 --> 01:13.534
GEORGIE:
Heads up, Humpty.

01:16.036 --> 01:18.579
ETHAN: Wait. Does
Humpty Dumpty
count as a person?

01:18.579 --> 01:21.332
All the putt-putt staff
and all the Diaz men

01:21.332 --> 01:23.204
couldn't put Humpty
together again.

01:23.204 --> 01:25.546
I'm pushing you out
of your comfort zone, salty,

01:25.546 --> 01:28.088
but that's when
greatness happens.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.591
I know you're pretty busy
coaching crackers,

01:30.591 --> 01:32.593
but what do you think about
trying out for the golf team?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.555
Can't. I'm committed
to this.

01:34.555 --> 01:36.927
Winners never quit
and quitters never win.

01:36.927 --> 01:38.979
Not sure that applies
to something that's

01:38.979 --> 01:40.891
just supposed to transport
cheese to your mouth.

01:40.891 --> 01:43.354
Come on, guys,
let's see some hustle.

01:44.525 --> 01:48.359
Well, that was a sesame-covered
slap in the face.

01:48.359 --> 01:50.571
I might be losing it.

01:50.571 --> 01:53.113
How about we channel
that craziness into golf?

01:53.113 --> 01:54.735
You'd be great.

01:54.735 --> 01:57.408
Yeah. In golf,
the lowest score wins.

01:57.408 --> 01:59.700
Basketball, soccer,
tennis.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.832
Who's always the lowest
scorer? You.

02:01.832 --> 02:06.006
I was voted "least likely
to score" three years in a row.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.688
to help Georgie practice
for her golf tryouts.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.939
So how's it going?

03:08.939 --> 03:12.072
Let's just say
Humpty got off easy.

03:14.735 --> 03:17.578
( glass shattering,
car alarm blaring )

03:19.580 --> 03:21.742
But don't worry.
I'm an inventor.

03:21.742 --> 03:23.744
We create things
to solve problems.

03:23.744 --> 03:26.667
The wheel, the light bulb,
and this.

03:26.667 --> 03:29.380
Pretty sure the golf ball's
already been invented.

03:29.380 --> 03:31.712
Just putt and prepare
to be wowed.

03:39.260 --> 03:41.722
Who's wowed now?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.143
You.

03:44.144 --> 03:45.516
Whoa.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.689
Meet my newest invention.

03:48.689 --> 03:50.611
The remote control
golf ball.

03:50.611 --> 03:52.313
The little round solution

03:52.313 --> 03:54.114
to Georgie's
giant lack of skill.

03:54.114 --> 03:56.236
I call it
the rock and roller.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.158
You mean cheat and liar.

03:58.158 --> 04:00.240
Georgie won't
go for that.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.162
She won't even know.

04:02.162 --> 04:05.746
Look, as long as she can
drive the ball 150 yards

04:05.746 --> 04:08.248
and sink a putt,
she makes the team.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.461
And Team Harley is going
to help her do that.

04:10.461 --> 04:12.963
Well, it's not like
she'd be taking
anyone's spot.

04:12.963 --> 04:15.676
Exactly. Before tryouts,

04:15.676 --> 04:18.137
I'll replace all
the balls in her bag
with rock and rollers.

04:18.137 --> 04:19.720
And when she makes
the squad,

04:19.720 --> 04:21.591
she'll do what
she always does--

04:21.591 --> 04:23.143
practice, then happily
ride the bench

04:23.143 --> 04:24.725
for the rest
of the season.

04:24.725 --> 04:26.807
Wait, is there
a bench in golf?

04:26.807 --> 04:29.730
No, but she'll be
playing so little,

04:29.730 --> 04:31.522
she'll have plenty
of time to build one.

04:34.194 --> 04:36.487
Dinner's almost ready.
Clear the table right now.

04:40.451 --> 04:43.784
My fault.
That is exactly what I said.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.746
What's for dinner?

04:45.746 --> 04:47.117
Shepherd's pie.

04:47.117 --> 04:48.579
- ( Daphne groaning )
- Again?

04:48.579 --> 04:50.170
Shepherd's why?

04:50.170 --> 04:52.333
I thought you guys liked
my shepherd's pie.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.874
When you first
started making it.

04:53.874 --> 04:55.546
Now we eat it
twice a week.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.418
It's played out, Mom.

04:57.418 --> 04:59.680
You guys complain no matter
what I put in front of you.

04:59.680 --> 05:02.012
I'm already stretched thin
with Dad out of town.

05:02.012 --> 05:04.595
Don't think of it
as shepherd's pie.

05:04.595 --> 05:07.017
Think of it as Monday's
tacos with Tuesday's
mashed potatoes over them.

05:07.017 --> 05:10.601
And today's nightmare.
Oh, come on, Mom.

05:10.601 --> 05:13.233
On those cooking shows,
they cook a delicious meal

05:13.233 --> 05:15.436
and dis at the same time.

05:15.436 --> 05:18.028
Maybe try using
a cookbook.

05:18.028 --> 05:19.650
This delightful woman
looks like

05:19.650 --> 05:22.202
she knows how to make
a variety of things.

05:22.202 --> 05:24.204
Look how happy she is.

05:24.204 --> 05:26.156
Because she's not raising
seven picky kids

05:26.156 --> 05:29.870
who complain about
her coq au vin with pea shoots.

05:29.870 --> 05:31.622
Oh, that does
sound delicious.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.584
Then shoot the pea
and make it already.

05:33.584 --> 05:35.796
You know what?
If it's that easy,

05:35.796 --> 05:38.879
you guys can cook dinner
tomorrow night.

05:38.879 --> 05:40.591
It's on.

05:40.591 --> 05:43.053
Be prepared
to eat your words,

05:43.053 --> 05:45.636
which will still be better
than a shepherd's pie.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.638
Great. Go for it.

05:47.638 --> 05:48.969
The first aid kit's
in the drawer,

05:48.969 --> 05:50.851
and the fire
extinguisher is...

05:50.851 --> 05:53.734
Eh, never mind. I need
a new kitchen anyway.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.778
You can do this, Georgie.

05:57.778 --> 05:59.650
Visualize your success.

05:59.650 --> 06:00.821
Swing club.

06:00.821 --> 06:02.072
Connect with ball.

06:02.072 --> 06:04.865
Apologize to person
hit with ball.

06:04.865 --> 06:08.038
Nope. Re-visualize.

06:09.540 --> 06:11.291
What is she doing?

06:11.291 --> 06:13.754
Is there a button on there
to make her stop talking
to herself?

06:13.754 --> 06:16.086
She was talking to toast
yesterday, Ethan.

06:16.086 --> 06:17.918
I'm not God.

06:17.918 --> 06:21.171
Let's do chocolate lava cake
with ice cream and sprinkles.

06:21.171 --> 06:23.173
Who has ideas
for dessert?

06:23.173 --> 06:24.885
I'm handling the menu.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.386
I got it from the cookbook

06:26.386 --> 06:28.268
of my favorite reality
TV show,

06:28.268 --> 06:30.851
The Shouty Housewives
 of New England.

06:30.851 --> 06:33.143
This recipe
serves four to six,

06:33.143 --> 06:35.516
but can be thrown on
eight to 12.

06:35.516 --> 06:37.568
Me and Deathnee
want to cut stuff.

06:37.568 --> 06:39.860
I'm good at it.
I did her hairdo.

06:39.860 --> 06:41.732
Wrong.

06:41.732 --> 06:43.864
I'm not letting you
or that devil doll

06:43.864 --> 06:45.696
near anything sharp.

06:45.696 --> 06:47.448
I'll call you when
it's time to set the table.

06:48.579 --> 06:50.120
You did not...

06:50.120 --> 06:52.703
just take off

you guys made all of this.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.820
I've seen you suck on
frozen taquitos

08:49.820 --> 08:51.862

to use the microwave.

08:51.862 --> 08:53.203

like this puppet.

09:13.884 --> 09:17.057

is broken.

such a wonderful job,

09:19.309 --> 09:21.351

09:21.351 --> 09:23.894

Nina claims is store bought

09:23.894 --> 09:25.355
looks fabulous.

09:25.355 --> 09:27.357

09:27.357 --> 09:29.690
because Patrice knows
Adele's cousin, and second,

09:29.690 --> 09:31.652
I thought we were only
cooking one night.

09:31.652 --> 09:34.494

clip my children's wings

09:34.494 --> 09:36.036

flown so high.

09:36.036 --> 09:37.868

No, and no corn dog-sicles
either.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.752
Then we're out
of ideas.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.916
I did it.
I made the golf team!

09:45.916 --> 09:48.048
- You did?
- Great job, Georgie.

09:48.048 --> 09:49.710
I can't believe it.

09:49.710 --> 09:51.632
I mean, I can believe it,

09:51.632 --> 09:53.674
because it totally
just happened,

09:53.674 --> 09:55.345
just like you said it did
while we were sitting here

09:55.345 --> 09:57.888
eating popcorn,
and yay, Georgie. Celebrate!

10:00.100 --> 10:02.222
I'm so proud
of you, Georgie. Oh!

10:03.483 --> 10:05.275
Bad seat.

10:05.275 --> 10:06.937
I might have gotten
a little carried away

10:06.937 --> 10:08.729
during my celebration
in the sand trap.

10:08.729 --> 10:10.230
Yes!!

10:15.946 --> 10:18.538
Yep, Georgie's finally
a winner,

10:18.538 --> 10:20.160
thanks to my rock and roller.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.372
Sure, it's kind of
a backdoor way in,

10:22.372 --> 10:24.294
but if I can make
my sister happy,

10:24.294 --> 10:26.126
I say rock and roll.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.252
I was sitting there.

10:32.252 --> 10:33.924
Hint number one.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.216
Everything you just threw
said Harley on it.

10:36.216 --> 10:39.099
Oh, sorry, but this seat
is the most supportive

10:39.099 --> 10:41.311
on the couch, and if
I wanna stay in peak condition,

10:41.311 --> 10:43.063
I have to respect
the machine.

10:43.063 --> 10:44.224
What machine?

10:44.224 --> 10:45.976
The machine.

10:45.976 --> 10:47.858
I've seen Georgie
 with a swollen elbow,

10:47.858 --> 10:50.150
a swollen shoulder,
 and a swollen knee.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.653
But I've never seen her
 with a swollen head.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.445
Thanks.

10:55.445 --> 10:57.117
Hey, that was mine.

10:57.117 --> 10:59.329
Sorry. Gotta hydrate
the machine.

10:59.329 --> 11:01.621
- What machine?
- That's what I said.

11:01.621 --> 11:04.414
The machine would really
appreciate some quiet.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.586
The machine
is out of order.

11:10.550 --> 11:14.174
I'm so proud and honored
to accept this award

11:14.174 --> 11:16.636
for golfing skill
and sportsmanship.

11:16.636 --> 11:18.428
And to my esteemed
opponent,

11:18.428 --> 11:22.302
may I just say,
"In yo' face, loser!"

11:22.302 --> 11:24.304
May I just say,

11:24.304 --> 11:26.977
you know you're
riding the bench, sista?

11:26.977 --> 11:28.648
Sure, but pretty soon,

11:28.648 --> 11:31.071
I'm going to need to know
my way around a trophy.

11:31.071 --> 11:33.073
Better practice
my victory tears.

11:35.115 --> 11:38.198
I'm so happy!

11:38.198 --> 11:39.579
Not quite there.

11:39.579 --> 11:41.161
I'm going to record it
and watch the game film.

11:43.583 --> 11:46.036
Winner Georgie,
kind of a bummer.

11:46.036 --> 11:47.958
We should've left her
in that sand trap.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.169
It's just a cocky phase.

11:49.169 --> 11:51.922
Great news.

11:51.922 --> 11:54.714
Team captain Lindsay
got attacked by a wild dog.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.096
That's turned into
an evil phase.

11:56.096 --> 11:58.338
It's just her leg.

11:58.338 --> 12:01.221
Point is, she's
missing the match
and I get to start.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.973
I can't wait to tell Mom.

12:02.973 --> 12:05.225
Georgie Diaz,
starter.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.188
Ooh! I'm so happy.

12:08.188 --> 12:10.110
Yes, nailed it.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.235
She's going to look
like a fool out there.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.357
You've got to tell her
the only reason she was good

12:17.357 --> 12:18.989
was because of
your trick ball.

12:18.989 --> 12:21.491
- Rock and roller.
- Really?

12:21.491 --> 12:23.864
My inventions may
blow up in my face,

12:23.864 --> 12:26.286
but at least I can
get the names right.

12:26.286 --> 12:29.709
Guys, we made
a horrible, horrible mistake.

12:29.709 --> 12:31.922
We made a delicious meal
that Mom liked.

12:31.922 --> 12:35.085
Beast and I were
only half trying.

12:35.085 --> 12:37.177
But you can't bottle up
this type of raw talent.

12:37.177 --> 12:40.590
Look, our biggest strength
is not knowing how to do things.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.973
That's how we get
our parents to do
everything for us.

12:42.973 --> 12:44.845
Have you ever seen a baby
change its own diaper?

12:44.845 --> 12:48.058
Are you saying
we should poop our pants?

12:48.058 --> 12:52.352
I will, but Mom
specifically told
us not to.

12:52.352 --> 12:55.395
Guys, I'm saying if we
pretend to not know how to cook,

12:55.395 --> 12:57.197
Mom won't make us do it.

12:57.197 --> 13:00.861
So we're going to cook
gross food on purpose?

13:00.861 --> 13:03.033
Finally, something
in our wheelhouse.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:14.174 --> 13:17.677
May I offer you
a warm brownie
and some hot gossip?

13:17.677 --> 13:19.629
Would this be tattling?

13:19.629 --> 13:23.093
- I made it with
real fudge.
- Spill.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.846
Tweedledee and Tweedledum
and Tweedle Full Of Herself

13:25.846 --> 13:28.228
are planning to mess up
dinner so they don't
have to cook anymore.

13:28.228 --> 13:30.931
What?!
Those little...

13:30.931 --> 13:33.313
Wow. Mmm.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.986
It's really hard to be mad
with a mouthful of warm brownie.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.739
Those little punks.
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

13:39.739 --> 13:41.491
Or pretend to like their food.

13:41.491 --> 13:43.283
They'll have to keep cooking

13:43.283 --> 13:44.865
until they admit
you're better at it.

13:44.865 --> 13:47.037
Then they'll finally
stop complaining.

13:47.037 --> 13:49.119
Great plan, Daphne.

13:49.119 --> 13:51.161
See, this is why you're
the best kid in the family.

13:51.161 --> 13:52.752
Don't butter me up.

13:52.752 --> 13:54.754
If you want another
brownie, just ask.

13:56.917 --> 13:59.920
Hey. Before I tell you this,
I want you to remember

13:59.920 --> 14:01.221
all the nice things
I've done for you.

14:01.221 --> 14:03.303
I see what
you're angling for,

14:03.303 --> 14:05.135
but if you wanna
be in my entourage,

14:05.135 --> 14:06.636
you're going to
have to work for it.

14:06.636 --> 14:09.139
You've made this next part
slightly easier.

14:09.139 --> 14:12.352
Georgie, you're
terrible at golf.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.435
Someone just got demoted
to golf shoe cleaner.

14:15.435 --> 14:17.317
This remote control
ball I invented

14:17.317 --> 14:19.529
has been making
all your shots for you.

14:19.529 --> 14:22.032
Sure, you've invented
some cool stuff,

14:22.032 --> 14:24.324
but a remote control
golf ball?

14:24.324 --> 14:26.246
I find that
pretty hard to...

14:30.370 --> 14:34.254
Wait, what?!
No.

14:34.254 --> 14:36.997
You're a witch.

14:36.997 --> 14:38.919
No, I'm an inventor.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.630
I invented something
to help

14:40.630 --> 14:42.422
that's turned out
to be a curse.

14:42.422 --> 14:44.214
Maybe I am a witch.

14:44.214 --> 14:47.717
Wait. So my tryouts...
I didn't do any of it?

14:47.717 --> 14:49.349
Well, when you walked
out on the green

14:49.349 --> 14:50.890
and tripped,
that was all you.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.562
So I cheated?

14:52.562 --> 14:54.394
You didn't;
I did.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.356
And just to get you
on the team.

14:56.356 --> 14:59.019
After that, I thought
you'd practice like
you always do.

14:59.019 --> 15:00.610
You made me think
I didn't have to.

15:00.610 --> 15:02.402
All I practiced
was my crying face

15:02.402 --> 15:03.984
and my post-game interview.

15:03.984 --> 15:06.196
You set me up
to look like a fool, Harley.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.697
I already had that
covered on my own.

15:07.697 --> 15:09.409
I'm sorry.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.661
Maybe you can
fake an injury.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.373
Or get a real one.

15:13.373 --> 15:15.335
Ooh, ask Rachel to teach
you how to walk in heels again.

15:15.335 --> 15:17.337
I have to play.

15:17.337 --> 15:19.299
Without me, the team
will be short a golfer.

15:19.299 --> 15:22.172
They'll miss
that tournament in Florida.

15:22.172 --> 15:25.885
Team captain Lindsay
already sold her hair
to buy a plane ticket.

15:25.885 --> 15:27.467
Wow. First a dog bite,
and now the hair.

15:27.467 --> 15:29.389
Rough week.

15:29.389 --> 15:30.971
I can't catch my breath.

15:30.971 --> 15:33.313
I feel light-headed.

15:33.313 --> 15:34.854
Like I'm tumbling
down a dark hole.

15:34.854 --> 15:37.897
Which is something
my golf ball won't do
at the match.

15:37.897 --> 15:40.230
How do we fix this,
how do we fix this?

15:42.272 --> 15:44.864
It's moving.
That's a sign.

15:44.864 --> 15:46.616
Maybe that means
we should use it.

15:46.616 --> 15:49.779
Actually, that means
I was sitting on the remote.

15:49.779 --> 15:51.992
But my butt agrees.

15:54.284 --> 15:56.836
This is so exciting.
You're a starter.

15:56.836 --> 15:59.959
I'm just a golfer
doing my golfer thing
that I am very good at.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.293
Should've invented
a remote control mouth zipper.

16:03.293 --> 16:05.135
Golf is boring.

16:05.135 --> 16:07.427
It's like the library.
You have to whisper.

16:07.427 --> 16:09.719
Go play. Just don't get
in any trouble.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.151
Lots of wind today.

16:33.453 --> 16:36.246
I thought you weren't
gonna use the remote
control golf ball again.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.618
Does that ball look like
I'm controlling it?

16:38.618 --> 16:39.959
Check it out.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.254
The golf ball's doing
the same thing as our car.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.507
Yoo hoo, come back.

16:49.259 --> 16:51.301
Right behind you. Ow!

16:51.301 --> 16:53.093
Well, I guess you don't
have to worry about

16:53.093 --> 16:54.894
Winner Georgie anymore.

16:56.266 --> 17:00.770
Why did I build this
so well?

17:00.770 --> 17:03.193
I can't even break
anything right.

17:03.193 --> 17:05.355
Hey, today
could've been worse.

17:05.355 --> 17:07.777
Georgie's had so many
epic sports failures,

17:07.777 --> 17:10.359
no one even questioned
her chasing a ball
into a water hazard.

17:10.359 --> 17:12.321
I wanted to help,
and all I did

17:12.321 --> 17:13.953
was mess things up.

17:13.953 --> 17:16.415
I'm the worst sister ever.

17:16.415 --> 17:18.538
Pretty sure
that's Rachel.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.420
True.

17:20.420 --> 17:22.462
But not helping.

17:22.462 --> 17:23.423
You know what would help?

17:23.423 --> 17:25.214
Talking to Georgie.

17:25.214 --> 17:27.426
You don't think
she'll be mad?

17:27.426 --> 17:29.469
Oh, no,
she'll be furious.

17:29.469 --> 17:30.970
That's why you're
going in alone.

17:36.636 --> 17:38.518
Georgie, I know
you're upset.

17:38.518 --> 17:40.890
You can throw
anything you want.

17:40.890 --> 17:43.943
You're only saying that
because you know I'll miss.

17:43.943 --> 17:45.445
And I'm not mad.

17:45.445 --> 17:46.986
You did me a favor.

17:46.986 --> 17:48.738
You made me realize
I'm done with sports.

17:48.738 --> 17:50.690
What?

17:50.690 --> 17:52.992
My whole life,

17:52.992 --> 17:54.904
I dreamed of
becoming a winner.

17:54.904 --> 17:57.117
But when it
finally happened,

17:57.117 --> 17:59.369
I was a bad one.
I lost my integrity.

17:59.369 --> 18:02.622
No. I forced you
into cheating.

18:02.622 --> 18:06.045
And I prefer to call it
performance enhancement.

18:06.045 --> 18:08.508
Which, now that
I've said it,

18:08.508 --> 18:11.010
doesn't sound
so great either.

18:11.010 --> 18:12.972
No, it's more
than that.

18:12.972 --> 18:15.094
I got cocky
and didn't practice,

18:15.094 --> 18:17.016
except for
my victory crying,

18:17.016 --> 18:19.479
which only made me realize
I am an ugly crier.

18:19.479 --> 18:21.521
Time for me to move on.

18:21.521 --> 18:24.524
I'm going to be a regular,
non-sporty American teenager.

18:24.524 --> 18:25.855
What do they do?

18:25.855 --> 18:27.397
I don't know.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.189
Go to the mall?

18:29.189 --> 18:31.531
- And do what?
- Nothing much.

18:31.531 --> 18:33.032
Nothing much.

18:33.032 --> 18:34.694
I can do that.

18:36.576 --> 18:38.448
How ironic.

18:38.448 --> 18:40.580
Harley, Ethan and Georgie
are at the mall,

18:40.580 --> 18:42.912
and you're here, cooking.

18:42.912 --> 18:46.416
Because we wanted to cook
a delicious meal for our mother.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.378
Our first course
is a soup.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.009
Soy sauce
and cantaloupe.

18:51.511 --> 18:53.012
A taste of the Orient

18:53.012 --> 18:55.094
with some sass
from the melon patch.

18:58.097 --> 18:59.429
Very nice.

19:01.471 --> 19:02.602
It is?

19:02.602 --> 19:05.565
It's got an interesting
crunch.

19:05.565 --> 19:07.477
That's
the breath mint crumble.

19:07.477 --> 19:10.480
Tastes like when
you brush your teeth,

19:10.480 --> 19:12.942
right after
you've thrown up.

19:14.274 --> 19:15.945
For our second course,

19:15.945 --> 19:17.737
sea bass and
cottage cheese smoothies.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.545
Not bad.

19:25.545 --> 19:27.337
Oh.

19:28.498 --> 19:29.879
Got a bone.

19:31.551 --> 19:32.632
You're not eating?

19:37.467 --> 19:38.718
Yum.

19:38.718 --> 19:40.760
That's so good.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.302
So jealous you
got all the bones.

19:42.302 --> 19:44.063
Wait. ( coughs )

19:46.065 --> 19:47.567
No, you didn't.

19:47.567 --> 19:50.480
I took a classic,
and kicked it up a notch.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.613
Tuna casserole with
layers of marshmallow fluff.

19:53.613 --> 19:55.735
I call it
surf and flurf.

19:55.735 --> 19:58.488
They say no one
should eat alone.

19:58.488 --> 19:59.909
It almost looks
too good to eat.

19:59.909 --> 20:01.120
Same time then?

20:08.878 --> 20:10.670
I'm out!

20:10.670 --> 20:12.171
There's no way I'm eating
the flurf and barf.

20:13.333 --> 20:15.965
Do I criticize
your cooking?

20:15.965 --> 20:18.047
See. Not so easy putting a meal
on the table every night.

20:18.047 --> 20:20.640
You're right.
Even cooking gross
food is hard work.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.182
At least yours
is sort of edible.

20:23.182 --> 20:26.015
Not the appreciation
I'd hoped for, but I'll take it.

20:26.015 --> 20:28.147
We promise not to complain
from now on...

20:28.147 --> 20:29.649
about dinner.

20:29.649 --> 20:32.111
Everything else
is still fair game.

20:32.111 --> 20:34.113
Are you gonna
finish that?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.662
How's mall life
treating you?

20:42.662 --> 20:44.824
Well, I've pretty much
done everything.

20:44.824 --> 20:46.245
Got an awkward
chair massage,

20:46.245 --> 20:48.458
browsed the sale rack
at Always 15,

20:48.458 --> 20:49.869
threw change
in a fountain.

20:49.869 --> 20:51.671
Dug it back up
to buy a churro.

20:51.671 --> 20:53.042
( phone buzzing )

20:53.042 --> 20:55.585
Oh. Strawberry-cinnamon
pretzel samples are out.

20:55.585 --> 20:56.876
Can I use this bag?

20:56.876 --> 20:58.758
How many samples
are you getting?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.720
As many as I can.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.552
Did you see what
the other kids

21:02.552 --> 21:04.554
are making for
dinner tonight?

21:07.186 --> 21:08.598
You having fun?

21:08.598 --> 21:10.310
Oh, yeah.

21:10.310 --> 21:13.393
This is everything
I thought it would be.

21:13.393 --> 21:14.814
Come on, Georgie.

21:14.814 --> 21:16.946
This can't be your life.

21:16.946 --> 21:18.698
Sports is your life.

21:18.698 --> 21:21.401
It's who you are.
It's who we are.

21:21.401 --> 21:22.992
Some of our best
family moments

21:22.992 --> 21:24.243
have been spent
watching you play.

21:24.243 --> 21:26.616
Why? I always lose.

21:26.616 --> 21:29.118
Exactly. That's
our tradition.

21:29.118 --> 21:32.622
Watch Georgie lose,
be mad at the other team,

21:32.622 --> 21:34.544
go out for pizza.

21:34.544 --> 21:36.175
We're nine people.

21:36.175 --> 21:38.798
It's hard to get us
together to do anything.

21:40.380 --> 21:42.181
But you do.

21:42.181 --> 21:44.384
You can't take that
away from us.

21:50.139 --> 21:52.812
Excuse me.
You dropped 20 dollars.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.895
A lotta kids your age
would've kept that.

21:55.895 --> 21:57.777
You're an honest gal.

21:57.777 --> 21:59.699
Some might call
that integrity.

21:59.699 --> 22:01.901
I'm calling it integrity.
You've got integrity.

22:01.901 --> 22:05.034
I'm Mrs. Sullivan.
These are my teammates.

22:05.034 --> 22:07.787
- We're mall walkers.
- You're a team?

22:07.787 --> 22:10.790
Not officially, but we call
ourselves the Pacemakers.

22:10.790 --> 22:13.793
I like your hustle,
hair for days.

22:13.793 --> 22:15.044
You play sports?

22:15.044 --> 22:17.086
She does. You do.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.048
Well, we're looking to
bring in some fresh feet.

22:19.048 --> 22:21.300
- Wanna join?
- She does. You do.

22:21.300 --> 22:24.263
- Unless you're loving this.
- I'm cut off.

22:25.805 --> 22:27.637
Apparently,
I'm an over-sampler.

22:27.637 --> 22:29.849
Georgie, you're
my man inside.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.851
I need you to go back in
and hit 'em hard.

22:36.776 --> 22:39.439
Hold my boba.
I'm comin' off the bench.

22:39.439 --> 22:40.940
Less talking,
more walking.

22:40.940 --> 22:42.151
Try to keep up, kid.

22:45.655 --> 22:46.786
Thanks, Harley.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.661
What just happened?

22:51.661 --> 22:54.624
Georgie found a new sport
for her in-between season.

22:54.624 --> 22:58.257
And our family's going to be
watching her do laps
around the food court.
