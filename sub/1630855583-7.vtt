But Gregg wasn't even in the building

34:09.174 --> 34:12.177
when Ben was pushed down
that elevator shaft.

34:12.177 --> 34:14.680
I believe whoever was
in the building that night

34:14.680 --> 34:17.099
was also with Ben hours earlier,

34:17.099 --> 34:19.142
when they tried to poison him

34:19.142 --> 34:21.979
just moments before
his Broadway debut.

34:23.146 --> 34:25.440
So, who did kill Ben Glenroy?

34:26.400 --> 34:28.318
Maybe it was someone who had a reason.

34:28.819 --> 34:31.989
Money? Jealousy? Something to prove?

34:31.989 --> 34:34.449
Maybe all of the above.

34:34.449 --> 34:35.868
I'm Mabel Mora.

Join me, flying solo this time,

Only Murders in the Building.

34:48.172 --> 34:50.174
- Yeah, I heard it.

34:50.883 --> 34:53.844
You were right.
They're a major pain in the ass.

34:56.638 --> 34:58.015
[sighs]

34:59.057 --> 35:01.768
And it's time to reopen the Glenroy case.
