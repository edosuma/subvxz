She's my friend.

Of course.
Constance Drucker.

20:54.220 --> 20:56.074
What do you say
we take a little drive

20:56.120 --> 20:59.044

about dear Old Constance?

Wendel|_Willis was
a recently hIred volunteer

21:32.290 --> 21:33.689
at Robson Research.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.756
I sent Aram and Park
to apprehend him,

21:35.790 --> 21:37.382
but they were too late.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.853
This is Willis's van leaving
the parking structure

21:39.890 --> 21:41.357
just before they arrived.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.027
RESSLER: We believe
Willis abducted Robson

21:43.060 --> 21:45.062
from the parking lot
when he went to lunch.

21:45.100 --> 21:48.228
Why would
a freelance I.T. worker
abduct two unrelated men?

21:48.270 --> 21:49.897
Has Governor Sweeney
talked yet?

21:49.940 --> 21:51.532
NO, and he's not
governor anymore.

21:51.570 --> 21:53.538
The media called a winner
in the election.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.730
It was Sweeney's
opponent

21:55.780 --> 21:57.771
You said the victims
were unrelated,

21:57.810 --> 21:59.471
but _that's not
entIrely true.

21:59.510 --> 22:01.944
A victim profile reveals
they have a lot in common.

22:01.980 --> 22:03.481
Powerful men,

22:03.520 --> 22:05.909
socially conservative,
politically active.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.486
It made us wonder
if any other

22:07.520 --> 22:10.080
recent kidnap victims
fit that profile.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.157
Andrew Darvis.
Pastor Of one Of the largest

22:13.190 --> 22:14.726
Baptist congregations
in America.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.921
He went missing for
two months last year,

22:16.960 --> 22:19.326
resurfaced_in the middle
Of a maSSIve manhunt,

22:19.370 --> 22:22.089
said he'd gone
on a_n_unannounced
spIrItual retreat,

22:22.140 --> 22:24.335
and apologized
for alarming anyone.

22:24.370 --> 22:26.133
Okay.
We have a pattern.

22:26.170 --> 22:27.501
Let's just hope Pastor Darvis

22:27.540 --> 22:30.407
has more to say
than Sweeney does.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.179
RESSLER: I couldn't help
but notice the identical

22:32.210 --> 22:34.770
circumstances between
you and RIchard Sweeney.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.640
And now James Robson.

22:36.680 --> 22:40.013
Three men with similar
pOIItlcal IdeologIes.

22:40.050 --> 22:42.951
I know James.
Good family man.

22:42.990 --> 22:45.151
I respect the work
he does for this country.

22:45.190 --> 22:47.590
Pastor Darvis, were you
really on sabbatical,

22:47.630 --> 22:51.418
or were you abducted
like Robson and Sweeney?

22:51.470 --> 22:53.529
I checked the case files.

22:53.570 --> 22:55.697
You're unwilling to provide
the authorities any details

22:55.740 --> 22:58.208
about how and where
you disappeared.

22:58.240 --> 23:00.936
There are reasons
I've maIntaIned
my SIIence.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.778
Now, I-I don't know
Governor Sweeney,

23:03.810 --> 23:07.177
but I suspect he would
very much appreciate

23:07.210 --> 23:09.314
his privacy
in this moment, too.

23:09.350 --> 23:11.045
WOMAN:
Blood looks good.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.684
CVS tests show
no abnormalities.

23:15.190 --> 23:17.886
As long as you continue
on the drug regimen,

23:17.930 --> 23:20.125
you should be able
to ride this out.

23:20.160 --> 23:23.197
I don't want to ride this out.
I want you to cut It out. Now!

23:23.230 --> 23:25.698
RESSLER: I have no clue what
happened to you or Sweeney,

23:25.730 --> 23:27.630
but James Robson
was kidnapped today.

23:27.670 --> 23:30.639
And if you have
any information that
can prevent harm to him,

23:30.670 --> 23:32.661
it's your responsibility
to talk to me.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.730
How long ago
was James taken?

23:35.780 --> 23:37.133
Two hours.

23:37.180 --> 23:40.149
Probably too late to
stop the first procedure.

23:40.180 --> 23:43.638
But maybe you can prevent
the second one.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.009
What kind
Of a procedure?

23:45.050 --> 23:47.587
That crazy woman wanted
to test my faith,

23:47.620 --> 23:49.918
so she perpetrated
the most invasive,

23:49.960 --> 23:53.691
ungodly action
humanly possible.

23:53.730 --> 23:55.789
But I did not break.

23:55.830 --> 23:58.196
I stood true
to what I believe.

23:58.230 --> 24:00.562
I'm sorry, but there's
nothing I can do.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.398
If I take out
what they put inside you,

24:03.440 --> 24:07.228
I could spend the rest
Of my life in prison.

Richard Sweeney has a womb?

passenger.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.296
That's why
he isn't talking.

26:15.340 --> 26:17.661
The victims undergo two
involuntary procedures.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.701
First, a uterus is
transplanted from a donor,

26:19.740 --> 26:21.901
and the patient is
put on immunosuppressants.

26:21.940 --> 26:25.148
Once the organ takes,
a fertilized embryo
is introduced.

26:25.180 --> 26:28.047
And after that, the kidnappers
wait for a viable heartbeat

26:28.080 --> 26:29.411
before they release
the victims,

26:29.450 --> 26:31.816
at which point the baby
can't be aborted.

26:31.850 --> 26:34.387
The men live in states with
restrictive abortion laws.

26:34.420 --> 26:36.183
What purpose can
any Of this serve?

It's an Object lesson.

26:40.230 --> 26:42.551
who advocate for government
control Of women's bodies.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.966

NO, their faces were
hidden by medical masks

But their leader was
a female surgeon,
blond, maybe 405.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.108
And the son Of a gun
had a C-section
and kept the baby.

What happened?

27:06.950 --> 27:08.713

in the storage room

27:08.760 --> 27:10.159
where Governor Sweeney
was dumped.

27:10.190 --> 27:13.353
And, well,
you tell them.

27:13.390 --> 27:15.119
The pill is
conjugated estrogen,

27:15.160 --> 27:17.549
generally prescribed as part
Of a hormone therapy program.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.420

27:23.340 --> 27:25.433
The drug,
is there a prescription?

27:25.470 --> 27:27.677
NO, but the FDA requires drugs
like these to have a unique

lot number in case
they need to be recalled.

27:29.510 --> 27:31.603

number to a local

her real name was?

27:52.170 --> 27:53.797
Katarina.

We heard Katarina fighting
with a man in the hallway.

Mom and Dad ran out
Of the apartment to help,

27:58.610 --> 27:59.929

27:59.970 --> 28:04.077
he had a gun,
shot my parents.

28:04.110 --> 28:07.307
Gave her a chance

28:10.280 --> 28:12.009

was all her fault,

Or he was. Before
he died 30 years ago.

The man we're working with
is not Raymond Reddington.

41:48.900 --> 41:50.629
Then who is he?

41:50.670 --> 41:53.104
He's a former KGB agent.

41:53.140 --> 41:55.779
Formerly known
as Ilya Koslov.
