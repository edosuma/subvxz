28:31.500 --> 28:32.458
Roi...

28:34.375 --> 28:36.000
[tense music playing]

28:36.875 --> 28:37.958
The necklace.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.708
[suspenseful music playing]

29:08.166 --> 29:09.708
[knocking on door]

29:13.500 --> 29:14.708
Morning.

29:17.750 --> 29:20.250
You had a bad night?
You don't look so good.

29:20.250 --> 29:21.916
I didn't sleep that well.

29:23.041 --> 29:24.875
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

29:25.375 --> 29:26.916
And what did you think?

29:27.750 --> 29:30.208
[gentle music playing]

29:30.208 --> 29:34.250
Camille, I already told you that
I'm not interested in a trivial affair.

29:34.250 --> 29:37.125
[melancholic string music playing]

29:37.125 --> 29:38.583
You must choose.

29:40.291 --> 29:41.583
Me or him.

29:44.750 --> 29:48.958
- [tense music playing]
- [men speaking indistinctly in French]

30:01.666 --> 30:03.416
[rapid typing]

30:16.458 --> 30:18.541
And what happens
when they finally open the vault?

30:18.541 --> 30:20.750
- Surprise!
- [vault clangs open]

30:20.750 --> 30:23.791
[suspenseful rock music playing]

30:25.708 --> 30:27.375
They'll find no trace of the jewels.

30:29.875 --> 30:32.708
<i>And with no obvious
evidence of a break-in,</i>

30:32.708 --> 30:35.791
<i>they'll have to find
their suspect elsewhere.</i>

30:35.791 --> 30:36.708
[knock on door]

30:39.791 --> 30:42.250
[siren wailing nearby]

30:46.208 --> 30:48.208
[indistinct chatter]

30:54.083 --> 30:56.083
- [Berlin] <i>So?</i>
- [Damián] Are you in your room?

30:56.083 --> 30:57.000
Mm-mm.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.041
<i>Polignac's place is surrounded by police.
See them?</i>

30:59.041 --> 31:01.333
- Yeah. I see them.
<i>- It looks like he's been arrested.</i>

31:01.333 --> 31:03.583
<i>As of now, he's their main suspect.</i>

31:03.583 --> 31:05.500
You have to make sure
that the police have gone

31:05.500 --> 31:07.333
before you contact the transporter.

31:07.333 --> 31:08.458
Got it.

31:09.041 --> 31:09.958
[call disconnects]

31:12.375 --> 31:15.583
Before the police have time
to begin their investigation,

31:15.583 --> 31:17.958
we will have already started
our evacuation plan.

31:17.958 --> 31:21.541
Bruce and Keila will be the first
to leave, disguised as backpackers.

31:30.125 --> 31:32.291
You will head directly to the bus station.

31:32.291 --> 31:36.125
You will go to Spain via the Pyrenees,
carrying three tins with the jewels.

31:36.125 --> 31:37.041
In the <i>bus</i>?

31:37.041 --> 31:41.791
Hmm. Have you ever seen the police
searching a bus for a diamond tiara?

31:42.291 --> 31:43.125
No.

31:43.125 --> 31:47.041
So, do you really think they'll stop you
to rummage through your backpacks?

31:47.541 --> 31:48.500
Improbable.

31:48.500 --> 31:51.125
After that, it'll be Roi
and Cameron's turn.

31:51.958 --> 31:53.958
[sirens wailing outside]

31:53.958 --> 31:56.041
[energetic music playing]

32:01.041 --> 32:03.375
[indistinct police radio chatter]

32:05.541 --> 32:10.083
You will head for the outskirts of Paris
to pick up the RV we brought from Spain.

32:10.083 --> 32:13.541
You come pick me up,
and we leave as one happy family.

32:14.416 --> 32:15.500
The Gonzalezes.

32:15.500 --> 32:16.625
[Berlin] <i>Martita.</i>

32:17.250 --> 32:18.250
<i>José Luis.</i>

32:18.833 --> 32:20.958
<i>And the head of the family, a widower.</i>

32:22.208 --> 32:23.875
[Damián] <i>I'll be second to last to leave.</i>

32:23.875 --> 32:27.583
We'll meet up a few blocks from the hotel
to avoid arousing suspicion.

32:27.583 --> 32:31.000
And as the captain of the ship,
I'll be the last one to leave the hotel.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.166
Berlin will dispose of all the material
we used for the heist.

32:34.166 --> 32:36.583
Telescopes, monitors, computers.

32:36.583 --> 32:38.666
He'll organize the pickup
with a transporter

32:38.666 --> 32:41.041
and then leave for Spain by train.

32:41.041 --> 32:43.583
It's all going to Australia. To a convent.

32:43.583 --> 32:46.625
Like a donation
from a charitable organization.

32:46.625 --> 32:48.958
[laughs]

32:48.958 --> 32:50.541
[knocking on door]

32:53.666 --> 32:57.791
I have to leave.
I need time to think things through.

32:57.791 --> 33:00.833
But... [sighs]
...we were about to have breakfast.

33:00.833 --> 33:02.000
I just called a cab.

33:03.291 --> 33:05.208
It's already difficult
to make up your mind

33:05.208 --> 33:07.416
when you're in love with one person.

33:08.458 --> 33:09.916
Imagine how it is for me.

33:11.916 --> 33:13.583
I'm leaving the country, Camille.

33:15.375 --> 33:17.375
At first, I intended on disappearing
without a trace,

33:17.375 --> 33:19.791
but now I've had second thoughts.

33:20.291 --> 33:24.083
So, once you've made your decision,
call me.

33:24.083 --> 33:25.708
I'll still be around for a few days.

33:25.708 --> 33:27.791
[somber string music playing]

33:36.791 --> 33:38.666

[police radio chirps]

[crowd murmuring]

33:47.208 --> 33:49.125
[officer] Okay. It's a mess. Yeah. Okay.

33:49.125 --> 33:51.000
- Ma'am, you can't go inside.
- I live here.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.291
- I can't allow it.
- [man on radio] <i>It's Polignac's wife.</i>

33:53.291 --> 33:54.833
- I'll let her through.
<i>- Have her come.</i>

33:54.833 --> 33:56.791
- She's on her way. Yeah.
- Thank you.

33:56.791 --> 33:58.875
[tense music playing]

34:02.500 --> 34:04.000
[indistinct chatter continues]

34:20.750 --> 34:23.708
[tense music building]

34:44.541 --> 34:45.458
Camille Polignac?

34:45.458 --> 34:46.458
Yes?

34:46.458 --> 34:47.958
Inspector Lavelle.

34:47.958 --> 34:50.000
Can someone please tell me
what's happening?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.708
I have a search warrant.

34:54.250 --> 34:56.125
I have to ask you to open that safe.

34:56.791 --> 34:58.625
[hesitates] I don't know the combination.

34:58.625 --> 35:02.083
It's a safe my husband uses for his work.

35:02.583 --> 35:03.833
What happened?

35:03.833 --> 35:06.125
Then we'll just have to break it open.

35:07.333 --> 35:10.291
Inspector, can you please tell me
what's going on?

35:10.291 --> 35:12.583
- Open it.
- And where's my husband?

35:13.083 --> 35:15.416
- [knocking on glass]
- Hey. Anyone there?

35:16.000 --> 35:19.500
Why am I here? I'm the victim.
I just got robbed, dammit.

35:21.291 --> 35:23.500
Does anyone work in this place?

35:24.125 --> 35:25.333
[under breath] Fuck's sake.

35:30.916 --> 35:32.708
Please have a seat, Monsieur Polignac.

35:33.958 --> 35:35.666
I apologize for keeping you waiting.

35:35.666 --> 35:38.000
As you can imagine, we've been quite busy.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.750
What with getting our warrants
and the forensics reports and such.

35:41.750 --> 35:43.000
[Polignac] Mm-hmm.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.541
Where were you last night?

35:45.250 --> 35:48.041
As I already said,
last night, I was at home, all right?

35:48.041 --> 35:50.166
I took a few pills
and woke up this morning.

35:50.166 --> 35:52.625
Do you sleepwalk, Monsieur Polignac?

35:54.500 --> 35:55.625
[Polignac sighs]

36:00.666 --> 36:05.458
Because, you see, here we have you
at 1:05 a.m. in the downstairs parking.

36:07.875 --> 36:09.125
That's not me. It's impossible.

36:09.708 --> 36:11.125
But, yes, I do have the same coat.

36:11.125 --> 36:15.000
And that car, the one driven
by the man with the same coat as you.

36:15.500 --> 36:16.916
Do you recognize it?

36:16.916 --> 36:19.416
Yes. Someone's stealing
my car there, Sherlock.

36:22.625 --> 36:25.375
We've pulled the images
from the security cameras.

36:25.875 --> 36:28.500
We have multiple cameras showing
your vehicle leaving the city

36:28.500 --> 36:30.500
and taking the N13 highway.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.666
The same thief.

36:31.666 --> 36:34.250
Well, then,
I guess he must've also stolen your phone.

36:34.250 --> 36:37.541
We tracked your phone and picked up
its signal on multiple towers

36:37.541 --> 36:40.250
along the road that leads to Chantilly.

36:40.250 --> 36:43.416
Where, it would appear,
you have your own country residence.

36:43.416 --> 36:44.333
Is that correct?

36:44.333 --> 36:46.500
Why are you asking
when you obviously know the answer?

36:49.833 --> 36:51.833
The judge authorized a search warrant.

36:51.833 --> 36:54.500
So, this morning, we searched your houses.

36:55.375 --> 36:59.041
I'd like to share with you
what my colleagues at forensics found.

37:02.208 --> 37:04.583
What we have here are fibers.

37:04.583 --> 37:05.833
I don't see anything.

37:06.666 --> 37:08.125
These are exactly the same fibers

37:08.125 --> 37:10.250
as those found
in the labels used for the jewels.

37:10.250 --> 37:11.791
Apparently, someone was burning them

37:11.791 --> 37:14.041
in the bathroom
of your house in Chantilly.

37:14.541 --> 37:15.791
You see this?

37:16.708 --> 37:18.333
These are ashes found in your toilet.

37:21.458 --> 37:22.708
And this small diamond,

37:23.875 --> 37:26.500
most likely from one
of the missing jewels,

37:27.208 --> 37:31.708
we found it
behind the cushions of your sofa.

37:33.375 --> 37:37.208
So, you still wanna keep your story
that you slept like a baby,

37:37.208 --> 37:38.541
Monsieur Polignac?

37:42.083 --> 37:44.083
[tense guitar music playing]

38:13.916 --> 38:15.166
[doorbell rings]

38:19.250 --> 38:20.208
[gently] Hey.

38:21.208 --> 38:24.166
I got here as fast as I could.
What's wrong?

38:24.166 --> 38:27.125
[sighs] Come in. Please.

38:31.458 --> 38:33.333
My husband is
the director of an auction house.

38:33.333 --> 38:35.291
- Mm-hmm.
- And...

38:35.916 --> 38:39.916
And last night,
44 million euros in jewels were stolen.

38:41.208 --> 38:45.125
Oh, wow. The poor, poor man. Terrible.

38:45.708 --> 38:48.875
Plus, with all the emotional turmoil
he's going through at the moment, that's...

38:49.666 --> 38:51.250
a real double whammy.

38:51.250 --> 38:52.583
It gets worse.

38:52.583 --> 38:56.750
He's been arrested.
They say he's the main suspect.

38:56.750 --> 38:58.750
[tense music playing]

38:58.750 --> 39:00.333
But why?

39:00.333 --> 39:01.250
They have proof?

39:01.750 --> 39:04.583
They say that he went out
in the middle of the night, and...

39:05.083 --> 39:07.041
It seems that forensics
have found evidence

39:07.041 --> 39:08.583
in our home in Chantilly.

39:09.250 --> 39:12.791
They found a small diamond...
and some fibers or something.

39:14.833 --> 39:16.041
[Camille sighs]

39:17.333 --> 39:18.875
I still can't believe it.

39:19.375 --> 39:21.250
Let's think about this. Okay?

39:21.250 --> 39:25.125
Did he have any contact with criminals?
Did he have money problems?

39:25.125 --> 39:27.041
Did he travel a lot?

39:27.041 --> 39:28.625
Of course he traveled a lot.

39:29.125 --> 39:30.750
I mean, that's his job.

39:30.750 --> 39:34.250
He traveled all over the world,
evaluating collections for auction.

39:34.750 --> 39:35.625
I don't know.

39:35.625 --> 39:38.583
Maybe all this time, he was preparing
a heist with Chapo Guzmán.

39:40.791 --> 39:41.916
[sniffles]

39:44.500 --> 39:46.125
- Hey.
- [lighter clicks]

39:46.625 --> 39:49.166
Hey, Camille... [sighs, clicks tongue]

39:49.166 --> 39:51.000
Don't get ahead of yourself.

39:52.791 --> 39:55.750
Uh, I mean,
if he was involved in criminal activity,

39:55.750 --> 39:59.208
you would have noticed, um...
multiple phones, um...

39:59.208 --> 40:01.833
that he goes
into another room to take his calls,

40:01.833 --> 40:03.666
or unexpected meetings.

40:04.291 --> 40:06.416
You're right. He does all that.

40:06.416 --> 40:09.791
He even has a personal safe
over there in the wall.

40:10.291 --> 40:11.291
Look.

40:11.291 --> 40:12.458
[sniffles]

40:12.958 --> 40:14.750
C'mon. C'mon.

40:15.458 --> 40:17.500
[tense music swells, fades]

40:17.500 --> 40:18.791
The police opened it

40:19.291 --> 40:22.708
with some kind of blowtorch
because I didn't have the combination.

40:24.083 --> 40:27.916
And they found boxes
with stuff, and... they took them away.

40:28.416 --> 40:31.333
All this time,
I've been living with a stranger.

40:32.916 --> 40:34.125
With a criminal.

40:34.125 --> 40:35.333
[softly] Hey.

40:36.750 --> 40:37.958
Hey, Camille.

40:38.625 --> 40:41.583
You have to stop thinking like that,
or you'll go crazy.

40:42.583 --> 40:44.291
I'm sure there's an explanation.

40:44.291 --> 40:46.375
[tender piano music playing]

40:47.750 --> 40:48.750
- Come here.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.500
<i>♪ Every time I look at you
Time just stands still ♪</i>

43:17.625 --> 43:20.333
<i>♪ I think I hear my heartbeat ♪</i>

43:20.333 --> 43:25.958
<i>♪ It's roaring, about to explode ♪</i>

43:26.666 --> 43:31.500
<i>♪ And all that I wish
Is that you stay with me forever ♪</i>

43:59.333 --> 44:04.000
<i>♪ Those cat eyes, killing me ♪</i>

44:04.000 --> 44:07.958
<i>♪ Taking my breath away ♪</i>

44:08.583 --> 44:13.000
<i>♪ Every time I look at you
Time just stands still ♪</i>

44:16.250 --> 44:18.666
<i>♪ I think I hear my heartbeat ♪</i>

44:18.666 --> 44:24.375
<i>♪ It's roaring, about to explode ♪</i>

44:25.125 --> 44:29.416
<i>♪ And all that I wish
Is that you stay with me forever ♪</i>

44:31.583 --> 44:34.250
<i>♪ With me forever ♪</i>
