13:06.240 --> 13:07.571
they don't even know
that it's Caitlin yet,

13:07.840 --> 13:09.524

I mean, she's not thinking straight.

- She's...
-She's becoming Killer Frost.

-It's just like in the Vibe.
-No, we don't know that yet.

she uses her powers,

13:27.560 --> 13:28.561

13:28.760 --> 13:30.250
And saving you from Savitar,

13:30.720 --> 13:32.085
that must have put her over the edge.

13:32.440 --> 13:33.771
- Right, how do we find her?
-I don't know.

13:34.040 --> 13:37.089

37:53.040 --> 37:54.565
Thank you, man.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.646
Thank you.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.083
There is one thing
you can do for me, mate.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.324
- Anything.
-Quit.

38:05.640 --> 38:07.483
- What?
-Tender your resignation

38:07.720 --> 38:10.963
from the Central City Police Department,
effective immediately.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.287
I can overlook the unexplained absences,

38:15.520 --> 38:19.047
the constant disregard
for the rules and regulations,

38:19.240 --> 38:21.481
but your moral compass
is broken, my friend.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.724
(SCOFFS) I point-blank refuse

38:25.960 --> 38:27.962
to work with someone
whose sense of right or wrong

38:28.200 --> 38:29.929
is as flippant as the weather,

38:30.680 --> 38:34.241
someone who thinks friendship
is more important than justice.

38:35.360 --> 38:37.840
You are unfit to be a CSI.

38:38.360 --> 38:41.762
Barry Allen has no place
in law enforcement.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.204
Now, do we have an agreement

38:50.040 --> 38:52.202
or would you like the Detective
to meet that girl?

38:56.600 --> 38:57.886
All right.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.405
(SIGHS)

39:07.720 --> 39:08.881
He's all yours.

39:12.440 --> 39:13.601
Hey, Albert.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.562
So, what can you tell me
about our, our meta friend?

39:19.280 --> 39:20.611
I don't really remember anything.

39:20.800 --> 39:23.121
To be honest with you,
it's all a bit of a blur, so...

39:29.120 --> 39:31.361
-(SIGHS)
-lRIS: Hey.

39:32.080 --> 39:33.161
Hey-

39:34.600 --> 39:35.840
We just heard from Singh.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.004
You quit? What, what is going on?

39:38.240 --> 39:42.484
(SIGHS) I, um,
didn't really have a choice.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.164
What do you mean,
you didn't have a choice?

39:45.560 --> 39:46.607
Julian.

39:47.600 --> 39:50.046
You quit, he keeps his mouth shut
about Caitlin.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.205
- That son of a bitch.
-I don't know.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.085
I mean, he said I couldn't do something
like protect Caitlin

39:55.280 --> 39:58.409
and still be a good CSI
and maybe he's right.

39:58.600 --> 39:59.806
No, he's not.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.329
Barry, you are an incredible CSI

40:02.520 --> 40:04.409
and no one in this building cares more
about helping people

40:04.600 --> 40:05.726
find justice than you.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.650
And that was long before
you were the Flash.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.450
This lab, it's your life.

40:09.640 --> 40:10.801
You're my life.

40:12.440 --> 40:13.521
Both of you.

40:14.040 --> 40:16.361
And Wally and Caitlin

40:17.600 --> 40:18.681
and Cisco.

40:20.480 --> 40:22.687
If these past few months have
taught me anything, it's that

40:23.680 --> 40:27.366
I would give up everything I have to keep
you all safe. No regrets.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.611
Every time I think you've run out of ways
to be a hero,

40:31.720 --> 40:33.006
you show me another one.

40:37.120 --> 40:38.360
- You hungry?
-Yeah.

40:38.560 --> 40:39.800
Yeah, let's get out of here.

40:50.400 --> 40:51.640
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

40:52.320 --> 40:53.845
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

40:55.560 --> 40:56.766
(CHUCKLES)

41:07.240 --> 41:08.366
SAVITAR: Julian. (ECHOING)

41:11.400 --> 41:12.481
<i>Julian.</i>

41:16.720 --> 41:18.245
No. Stay away.

41:19.760 --> 41:20.886
<i>No, Julian.</i>

41:21.240 --> 41:22.571
<i>You can't get</i> away.

41:22.920 --> 41:24.729
<i>There's nowhere I won't find you.</i>

41:30.920 --> 41:32.081
Only together

41:33.240 --> 41:35.925
can we bring about my return.

41:38.480 --> 41:40.687
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

41:46.600 --> 41:49.365
<i>Become my servant once more.</i>

41:55.480 --> 41:57.847
<i>Become Alchemy.</i>
