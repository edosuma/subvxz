00:01.250 --> 00:03.417
"The only thing more delicious
than my meal last night

00:03.500 --> 00:05.041
"was the age-defiant owner.

00:05.083 --> 00:08.000
Run don't walk
to Jimmy's Restaurant."

00:08.083 --> 00:10.291
Five stars,

00:10.375 --> 00:12.000
Anonymous2033488T.

00:12.083 --> 00:14.083
(phone buzzes)

00:52.208 --> 00:54.417
(chuckles) I'm glad.

01:06.291 --> 01:08.792
(phone rings)

01:08.875 --> 01:10.834
Hey!
That's my parking spot, chief!

01:10.959 --> 01:11.875
Oh, hey, you!

01:12.000 --> 01:14.291
Are you here?

01:14.333 --> 01:15.583
You know it. Yeah.

01:15.667 --> 01:17.125
I'll see you in a second. Bye.

01:20.125 --> 01:22.000
(ringing)

01:22.083 --> 01:24.000
Um, what's the address
of the park...

01:24.083 --> 01:25.583
that I'm at?

01:25.667 --> 01:27.041
Hello?

01:27.125 --> 01:29.000
Hello?

01:34.792 --> 01:36.458
Guys, here's why
Jimmy couldn't make it.

01:36.542 --> 01:39.041
Yeah, my quake app is showing
a 2.1 magnitude in Big Bear.

01:39.125 --> 01:40.875
(chuckles)
I knew I felt something.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.709
No, honey, what
you were feeling

01:42.792 --> 01:44.333
was frustration,
disappointment,

01:44.417 --> 01:46.125
hopefully a little rage.

01:46.208 --> 01:48.125
Let it out, Gerald.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.458
How could he do this?

01:49.500 --> 01:50.667
She turned two!

01:50.750 --> 01:51.834
He's dead to me, guys.

01:51.959 --> 01:52.875
JIMMY:
I'm here!

01:53.000 --> 01:54.750
Hey. Jimmy!
Sorry I'm late.

01:54.834 --> 01:56.083
(laughs)
Good to see you, man.

01:56.166 --> 01:58.500
Oh, good, Edie, he
brought the champagne.

01:58.583 --> 01:59.875
Ooh, rough turnout.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.875
Did you even hire
a party promoter?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.208
Next time, I have a guy.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.250
No, you are two hours late

02:05.333 --> 02:06.875
to a two-hour party, Jimmy.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.166
You missed it.

02:08.250 --> 02:10.083
That's my style;
I show up fashionably late

02:10.166 --> 02:12.000
so I don't have to have
awkward chit-chat with the host.

02:12.083 --> 02:13.250
The host was me.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.250
Clearly my plan didn't work.

02:17.041 --> 02:18.875
All right, what'd I miss?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.750
Yeah, yeah, your only
granddaughter's second birthday.

02:22.834 --> 02:25.291
Oh, I apologize, Edie.

02:25.375 --> 02:27.417
But if your party was better,
then more people would be here

02:27.500 --> 02:29.041
and I wouldn't have missed it.

02:30.041 --> 02:31.208
I just cleaned this.

02:31.291 --> 02:32.458
Don't make me
get it dirty again.

02:33.709 --> 02:35.417
All right, I get it.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.250
I screwed up,
but you know what?

02:37.333 --> 02:39.375
I know how to make this up
to Edie. You know how?

02:39.458 --> 02:41.333
By paying
for her college education?

02:41.417 --> 02:43.000
No, I'm gonna have

02:43.083 --> 02:44.792
an even better party for her
at my restaurant tomorrow.

02:44.875 --> 02:46.041
Everyone's invited, friends,

02:46.083 --> 02:49.125
family, important people I know.

02:49.208 --> 02:50.500
Oh, invite your brother.

02:50.583 --> 02:51.625
Is he still in Palm Springs?
Frederick?

02:51.709 --> 02:53.208
No, no, no. He's busy.

02:53.291 --> 02:54.959
Busy being a nut job?

02:55.041 --> 02:57.000
Does he still keep
that sword in his trunk?

02:57.083 --> 02:59.542
(laughs)
He is crazy. He is.

02:59.625 --> 03:01.125
Anyway, it's gonna be
a great party.

03:01.208 --> 03:02.750
Party starts at 1:00.
You guys all show up at...

03:02.834 --> 03:05.542
3:00?

03:05.625 --> 03:07.291
Hey, hey, hey.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.583
Listen, you don't, uh,
you don't need to do this.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.542
Have you ever even thrown
a kid's birthday party before?

03:11.625 --> 03:13.792
Gerald, I've hosted Mariah
Carey's 40th birthday party

03:13.875 --> 03:15.375
for the last five years.

03:15.417 --> 03:17.000
I think I can throw a party
for a two-year-old kid

03:17.083 --> 03:18.750
who's not even famous.
This is what I do.

03:18.834 --> 03:20.542
This is what I like
to do, Gerald.

03:20.625 --> 03:22.750
Annelise, I need you
to throw me a party.

03:22.834 --> 03:25.125
Now? I'm visiting
my grandmother's grave.

03:25.208 --> 03:26.333
Is she going somewhere?

03:26.417 --> 03:28.000
(sighs)

03:28.083 --> 03:29.875
I'll be there soon.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Oh, and tell her I said hi.

03:32.041 --> 03:34.041
Look, if you, uh, if you really
want to crush this,

03:34.125 --> 03:36.208
it would be cool if you got
Big Bird to make an appearance.

03:36.291 --> 03:37.792
Edie and I are really huge fans.

03:37.875 --> 03:38.834
Got it. Get a bird.

03:38.875 --> 03:40.041
No, no, no, Big Bird.

03:40.125 --> 03:41.417
Yeah, all right, it'll be huge.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.041
Uh, you know, before you go, I,
uh, I wanted to ask

03:44.125 --> 03:46.041
your opinion about something.

03:46.125 --> 03:47.834
What? Um, no.

03:47.959 --> 03:50.166
See, I'm working on this
whole master plan for my life.

03:50.250 --> 03:51.583
Step One: Meet my dad.

03:51.667 --> 03:52.959
Check.

03:53.041 --> 03:54.041
Step Two: Get some cool shirts.

03:54.125 --> 03:55.709
Apparently not check.

03:55.792 --> 03:57.792
Uh, Step Three: Bust out
of the friend zone with Vanessa.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.625
You guys have a baby together.

03:59.709 --> 04:01.291
I'm pretty sure the word "friend
zone" doesn't apply here.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.041
Plus, I heard feminists
don't like that term.

04:03.125 --> 04:05.709
Yeah, we don't,
but it's easier to use it.

04:05.792 --> 04:08.041
Anyway, I was thinking about
sending her anonymous hydrangeas

04:08.125 --> 04:09.291
for her 26th birthday.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.583
Then on her 27th birthday,

04:10.667 --> 04:13.542
reveal it was me.

04:15.417 --> 04:17.083
(engine starts)

04:17.166 --> 04:18.333
Watch your toes.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.000
Fernando, where's my raw bar?

04:25.083 --> 04:26.166
My raw bar.

04:26.250 --> 04:27.458
Rose, these are gift
certificates

04:27.542 --> 04:28.834
for a massage at Highland Spa.

04:28.959 --> 04:30.083
Make sure every kid gets one.

04:30.166 --> 04:31.959
Okay, watch-watch the cannolis.

04:32.041 --> 04:33.625
Why the hell are we doing this?

04:33.709 --> 04:34.834
I thought we hated children.

04:34.959 --> 04:36.083
He's in the doghouse

04:36.166 --> 04:37.750
for missing
his granddaughter's b-day.

04:37.834 --> 04:39.375
Edie needs to get over herself.

04:39.417 --> 04:40.458
I'm on Team Jimmy.

04:40.542 --> 04:42.000
Bros before grandhos, right?

04:43.166 --> 04:45.166
That felt horrible to say.

04:45.250 --> 04:48.417
Guys, this isn't just
about me fixing my mistake.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.083
This is a golden opportunity
in disguise.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.375
I'm throwing a party at
my Michelin-quality restaurant,

04:53.458 --> 04:55.542
the likes of which these people
have never seen before.

04:55.625 --> 04:57.125
I'm gonna be a hero.

04:57.208 --> 04:59.000
Am I too obsessed
with being loved?

04:59.083 --> 05:01.125
BOTH: Yes.

05:01.208 --> 05:03.458
Oh, look, the
magician is starting.

05:03.542 --> 05:06.792
This is the trick
that killed my mentor.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.083
(motor starts)

05:08.166 --> 05:10.125
(gasping)

05:10.208 --> 05:11.041
(kids screaming)

05:11.125 --> 05:12.834
(revving)

05:14.709 --> 05:17.875
Hey, kid, do you know
how much that caviar costs?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.458
I'm too young to know prices.

05:20.542 --> 05:22.166
Enjoy your childhood.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.875
Because when you grow up,
the world will be out of water.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.333
JIMMY:
Owning a restaurant?

05:26.417 --> 05:27.542
Piece of cake.

05:27.625 --> 05:28.834
Being a parent?

05:28.959 --> 05:30.583
Hardest job in
the world, right?

05:30.667 --> 05:32.583
Being a grandparent
is no cakewalk either.

05:32.667 --> 05:35.166
We don't have the energy
you all have.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.333
Well...

05:36.417 --> 05:37.917
People ask us,
"Where do you live?"

05:38.041 --> 05:39.166
We tell them, huh?

05:39.250 --> 05:40.208
"The bathroom!"

05:40.291 --> 05:41.625
(laughter)

05:41.709 --> 05:45.250
I live in a modern
loft downtown.

05:47.166 --> 05:48.208
Well, this is awkward.

05:48.291 --> 05:50.083
You and me at the same party.

05:50.166 --> 05:51.709
Oh, you're the chef, right?

05:51.750 --> 05:54.417
(laughs)
Yeah, I think you know who I am.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.166
The chef?

05:56.250 --> 05:58.166
Look, it's totally natural

05:58.250 --> 05:59.709
you and I would be wary
of each other.

05:59.792 --> 06:01.709
We're both kind
of like sons to Jimmy.

06:01.792 --> 06:03.792
Oh, I'm not like
a son to Jimmy.

06:03.875 --> 06:06.166
Look, I'm just gonna cut
to the chase here, bub.

06:06.250 --> 06:08.291
I feel totally
threatened by you,

06:08.333 --> 06:10.750
and I'm not sure
how to process it.

06:12.041 --> 06:13.250
Boom!

06:13.333 --> 06:15.250
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
I'm sorry.

06:17.458 --> 06:18.834
(gasping)

06:21.250 --> 06:22.667
Hey,

06:22.750 --> 06:24.667
did you, um,

06:24.750 --> 06:26.208
invite a bunch of fancy people

06:26.291 --> 06:28.208
to the party to show off?

06:28.291 --> 06:30.041
I'm not trying to showing off.

06:30.125 --> 06:31.208
Oh, say, did you see
Richie Sambora is playing?

06:31.291 --> 06:33.166
Oh, Sambora.

06:33.250 --> 06:35.000
You know what kids like.

06:35.083 --> 06:36.417
Wait till you taste the cake.

06:36.500 --> 06:37.959
It's tiramisu made
with Saint Lucian rum.

06:38.041 --> 06:39.792
Can the kids eat that?

06:39.875 --> 06:41.208
Oh, we have another cake.

06:41.291 --> 06:42.375
Ravi, get another cake.

06:42.458 --> 06:43.625
Gotcha.

06:43.709 --> 06:45.959
Oh, say, were you invited
to Ethan Purcell's

06:46.041 --> 06:47.583
third birthday party
next weekend?

06:47.667 --> 06:48.792
'Cause I was.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.291
What?

06:50.375 --> 06:51.417
Look, if it upsets
you that much,

06:51.500 --> 06:53.208
I can get you on the list.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.000
You invited my brother?

06:55.083 --> 06:56.291
Yeah,
turns out he wasn't busy.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.125
I'm gonna go say hi.

06:58.208 --> 06:59.792
Uh, one thing you
should know, though.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.917
Uh, he thinks you're a deadbeat

07:02.000 --> 07:04.250
who ran out on me
when I got pregnant with Gerald.

07:04.333 --> 07:05.500
What?!
I didn't know you were pregnant.

07:05.583 --> 07:06.792
Why would he think that?

07:06.875 --> 07:08.834
It was something he heard...

07:08.959 --> 07:10.250
from me.

07:10.333 --> 07:12.250
Why would you lie about that?

07:12.333 --> 07:13.750
I knew my family
would think I was crazy

07:13.834 --> 07:16.291
for raising Gerald alone,
so I just made it up,

07:16.375 --> 07:18.500
so that it would seem
like it was out of my hands.

07:18.583 --> 07:20.125
Well, go tell him
the truth.

07:20.208 --> 07:21.625
I will.

07:21.709 --> 07:22.834
Eventually.

07:22.959 --> 07:24.500
But, um, if get into this now,

07:24.583 --> 07:26.000
it'll ruin Edie's party.

07:26.083 --> 07:27.166
Can you just go along

07:27.250 --> 07:29.000
with this for now, please?

07:29.083 --> 07:31.625
All right, fine.

07:31.709 --> 07:33.250
But you owe me
for my selflessness.

07:33.291 --> 07:35.417
Eh, Gandhi in Gucci
over here.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.542
I mean, it probably
won't even come up.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.500
Hey, sis.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.917
Hey, Frederick.

07:40.041 --> 07:42.000
Jimmy, thank you so much
for inviting me.

07:42.041 --> 07:43.709
I'm gonna hit the bathroom,
get a drink,

07:43.792 --> 07:45.500
and then at some point,
I'm gonna come back

07:45.583 --> 07:48.333
and I'm gonna kill you, so...

07:49.792 --> 07:51.291
The birthday girl's here!

07:51.375 --> 07:54.291
ALL:
Surprise!

07:54.375 --> 07:56.333
(children screaming)

07:56.417 --> 07:57.792
Surprise.
Did he say "kill"?

07:59.208 --> 08:01.583
JIMMY: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:05.375 --> 08:08.083
Frederick, can I have a word?

08:08.166 --> 08:09.625
No.

08:09.709 --> 08:10.417
Oh.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.458
Aw, I'm kidding.

08:11.542 --> 08:12.583
(chuckles)

08:12.667 --> 08:13.667
Lighten up, James.

08:13.750 --> 08:15.041
You think I'm telling everybody

08:15.125 --> 08:16.083
about what you did to Sara?

08:16.166 --> 08:18.166
No, I don't think that.
Are you?

08:18.250 --> 08:19.542
Yes.

08:19.625 --> 08:20.750
I'm kidding. No, no.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.834
I'm confused.

08:21.917 --> 08:22.834
So was Sara when you left her.

08:22.917 --> 08:24.083
Listen, about that.

08:24.166 --> 08:25.917
Could you keep that to yourself?

08:26.000 --> 08:29.125
I've invited some
very important people here.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.125
And my reputation
is important to me.

08:30.208 --> 08:32.500
But, hey, look.

08:32.583 --> 08:34.792
I feel terrible about, um,

08:34.875 --> 08:36.542
about what I did.

08:36.625 --> 08:38.792
You know what?

08:38.875 --> 08:40.542
Apology accepted.

08:40.625 --> 08:41.542
Really?

08:41.625 --> 08:42.792
No.

08:42.875 --> 08:44.792
Yes. No.
Yes?

08:44.875 --> 08:46.542
Yes. No, yes.

08:54.041 --> 08:55.500
(groans)

08:55.583 --> 08:58.083
You better eat that.

09:00.166 --> 09:01.458
What?

09:01.542 --> 09:03.625
I have to go to the bathroom.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.000
Second door on the left.

09:06.250 --> 09:07.166
What?

09:07.250 --> 09:09.166
Can you please help me?

09:09.250 --> 09:11.000
That is not my department, kid.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.250
I'm gonna go on the floor.

09:15.458 --> 09:16.750
Come on!

09:16.792 --> 09:18.542
Nope!

09:22.250 --> 09:24.583
Uh, Vanessa?

09:24.625 --> 09:26.333
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

09:26.417 --> 09:28.500
I only stole massage gift cards
from the rich kids.

09:28.583 --> 09:30.625
What?
Fine! Here.

09:30.709 --> 09:32.375
No, that's not
what I'm talking about.

09:32.458 --> 09:33.792
So-so-so sorry.

09:33.875 --> 09:35.333
Um, where do you
want the falcon?

09:35.417 --> 09:36.750
"The falcon"?

09:36.834 --> 09:39.375
Yeah, Jimmy said
you wanted a big bird.

09:41.208 --> 09:42.542
You got to be kidding me!

09:42.625 --> 09:45.208
No, I promised Edie
we'd have Big Bird.

09:45.291 --> 09:46.625
(laughs):
Oh, oh!

09:46.709 --> 09:48.208
See, now, that would've
been a great idea.

09:48.291 --> 09:49.667
That would've been so good.

09:49.750 --> 09:52.417
So, what did you want
to talk to me about?
Uh...

09:52.500 --> 09:53.500
Stay right here.
I'll be right back.

09:53.583 --> 09:54.667
Stay right there.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.291
Ooh, got to be honest.

09:56.375 --> 09:58.208
I don't think Jimmy
would've done that to me.

09:58.291 --> 09:59.625
Not that this is a competition.

09:59.709 --> 10:01.291
Does he hug you?

10:01.375 --> 10:03.417
He hugs me!

10:03.500 --> 10:05.083
Señor Plucky's.

10:05.166 --> 10:07.250
Excuse me?
Excuse me...

10:07.333 --> 10:08.458
Hey.

10:08.542 --> 10:10.000
Uh, big fan
of your food.

10:10.083 --> 10:11.208
Oh, nice.

10:11.291 --> 10:12.583
That's why I got
into this game.

10:12.667 --> 10:14.041
Great. Uh, uh...

10:14.125 --> 10:15.208
random question-- uh,

10:15.291 --> 10:16.625
is there any way
I could, like, rent

10:16.709 --> 10:18.208
your costume for
a couple hours?

10:18.291 --> 10:19.583
I'll pay anything.

10:19.667 --> 10:21.667
Yep. I get it.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.083
(chuckles)

10:23.166 --> 10:25.166
Just make sure
you dry clean it.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.125
And don't videotape
anything.

10:27.208 --> 10:29.250
What are you talking about?

10:29.333 --> 10:32.417
I'm not supposed to give
the costume to furries.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.333
But, hey,
everyone deserves love.

10:34.417 --> 10:35.959
No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:36.041 --> 10:37.625
It's for my, uh,
two-year-old's birthday.

10:37.709 --> 10:39.250
Right.
Got it.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.333
Okay.

10:41.417 --> 10:42.959
Just, uh, here...

10:43.041 --> 10:45.625
Thanks.
(laughs)

10:45.667 --> 10:47.250
I'm into some weird stuff, too!

10:47.333 --> 10:49.417

I'd try to remember

that today is supposed to be
about your granddaughter.

to work three jobs

15:28.667 --> 15:30.000
when Gerald was little?

15:30.083 --> 15:33.375
Yeah. I worked at the
ear-piercing place in the mall,

15:33.458 --> 15:35.667
I was a cook at Casa Pasta,
and I babysat.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.667
Kind of a poor man's
Ryan Seacrest.

15:37.750 --> 15:40.625
If things were
that hard for you,

15:40.709 --> 15:42.959
why didn't you come to me?

15:43.041 --> 15:45.667
And why didn't you tell me
you were pregnant?

15:45.750 --> 15:49.333
I was going to tell you
at the Cure concert.

15:49.417 --> 15:50.625
Remember that night?

15:52.458 --> 15:53.667
Right before we broke up,

15:53.750 --> 15:55.041
I got us tickets to
The Cure in Anaheim.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.959
We were supposed to meet
at my place first.

15:57.041 --> 15:59.875
I was doing my eye makeup.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.834
I was waiting to do yours,

16:01.917 --> 16:04.208
and at the last minute
you called and said

16:04.291 --> 16:05.750
you were stuck
at a pool party

16:05.834 --> 16:07.208
and you weren't gonna make it.

16:07.291 --> 16:09.750
So I went to the
show by myself.

16:09.834 --> 16:12.458
And I stood there
through the whole thing,

16:12.542 --> 16:14.792
pretending I didn't care.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.500
Until the last song--

16:16.583 --> 16:18.625
"Pictures of You."

16:18.709 --> 16:20.542
I just started bawling.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.709
I mean a snotty mess.

16:22.792 --> 16:25.125
Eye makeup everywhere.

16:25.208 --> 16:27.792
And this guy next to me
felt so bad,

16:27.875 --> 16:29.583
he put his arm around me.

16:29.667 --> 16:31.125
(chuckles)

16:31.208 --> 16:33.709
Then he tried to grab my boob.

16:33.792 --> 16:37.041
And you'd flaked on me
plenty of times before,

16:37.125 --> 16:40.250
but that night
I just made up my mind

16:40.333 --> 16:43.041
that you weren't capable of
being there for little Anthony.

16:44.417 --> 16:46.792
I toyed with a few names
before Gerald.

16:46.875 --> 16:47.917
You should've stuck
with Anthony.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.166
And in case you're wondering,

16:52.250 --> 16:55.208
I fully realize that I may have

16:55.291 --> 16:57.834
made the wrong decision.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.834
What? Oh, what are you doing?

17:09.291 --> 17:11.375
Attention everyone, hi.

17:11.458 --> 17:12.208
It's me again.

17:12.291 --> 17:14.291
Uh, I was thinking about

17:14.333 --> 17:16.000
what I said earlier,
and, uh,

17:16.083 --> 17:17.083
you probably you don't even
remember what I said, but...

17:17.166 --> 17:19.166
That Sara lied about you
being a deadbeat?

17:19.208 --> 17:21.667
Yeah, and she hid
her pregnancy from you.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.208
Yes, those are the headlines.

17:24.291 --> 17:27.792
It's true that Sara didn't
tell me she was pregnant.

17:27.875 --> 17:30.917
But what's also true is
I deserved it.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.083
I wasn't
a very good guy back then.

17:34.166 --> 17:36.208
(scoffs)

17:36.291 --> 17:37.709
Just...

17:37.750 --> 17:42.166
Okay, yes, but he
was also young.

17:42.583 --> 17:45.542
And I was the one who carried
a grudge against him

17:45.583 --> 17:49.291
for 25 years instead of
giving him a chance to change.

17:49.375 --> 17:51.083
Well, I don't know
if I would have changed.

17:51.166 --> 17:52.375
If found out you
were pregnant,

17:52.458 --> 17:53.834
I don't think I could
have handled it.

17:53.959 --> 17:56.375
You blew me off for
a pool party. So what?

17:56.458 --> 17:58.166
Why are you talking
about this in front of us?

17:58.250 --> 17:59.250
It seems real private.

17:59.333 --> 18:01.583
Hey, he gave you Richie Sambora

18:01.667 --> 18:02.709
and a magician that pulled

18:02.792 --> 18:04.125
string out of his eye.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.458
He can do whatever he wants.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.208
Thank you.

18:08.291 --> 18:10.375
My point is

18:10.458 --> 18:11.709
don't be mad at Sara.

18:11.792 --> 18:13.291
I mean,

18:13.375 --> 18:15.208
she did the right thing.

18:15.291 --> 18:16.875
I wasn't ready for a family.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.333
And I'm not sure if I'm ready
for a family now,

18:19.417 --> 18:21.000
but I'm trying.

18:21.083 --> 18:24.458
I guess that's
the main takeaway for today.

18:24.542 --> 18:27.375
Isn't the main takeaway
"Happy Birthday Edie"?

18:27.458 --> 18:28.709
Oh, yeah, that too.

18:28.792 --> 18:29.959
Well, it's a tie.

18:30.041 --> 18:31.458
Good night, everybody.

18:35.333 --> 18:38.333
Wow. That's a lot of complicated
stuff for a kid's party.

18:38.417 --> 18:39.625
Yeah.

18:42.083 --> 18:43.417
I'm sorry.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.625
Really?
Yes.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.041
No.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.250
Yes.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.083
Oh, I can't tell if I want
to hug you or hurt you.

18:51.166 --> 18:52.625
Hug. I would choose hug.

18:52.709 --> 18:54.208
Oh.

18:54.291 --> 18:55.625
Frederick, actually,
you're hurting me.

18:55.709 --> 18:57.500
I know. I'm so confused.

19:10.709 --> 19:12.250
Excuse me, miss?

19:12.333 --> 19:14.625
Were you in the bathroom
with my boys earlier?

19:14.709 --> 19:16.458
Yes, but I'm the bathroom lady.

19:16.542 --> 19:18.000
I think you
just potty-trained my sons.

19:18.083 --> 19:19.291
Thank you.

19:22.542 --> 19:24.458
I have to go to the bathroom.

19:24.542 --> 19:26.417
Nope.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.834
MAN: Great party, dude.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.083
Oh, hey, hey, I just
want you to know,

19:30.125 --> 19:31.709
you put on a hell of a party.

19:31.792 --> 19:33.166
You're not bad at
this grandpa stuff.

19:33.250 --> 19:34.625
Thanks, brother.

19:36.625 --> 19:38.458
Oh, I'm not your son.

19:38.542 --> 19:39.542
I'm your brother!

19:39.625 --> 19:42.792
(laughs)

19:42.875 --> 19:45.208
Yo, G! Wait, hold up.

19:47.208 --> 19:48.375
Thanks for getting
that chicken suit.

19:48.458 --> 19:49.625
It's a good look on you.

19:49.709 --> 19:50.959
Yeah, I'm thinking
about keeping it.

19:51.041 --> 19:52.250
Spruce up my wardrobe.

19:52.333 --> 19:54.458
Yeah? (laughs)

19:54.500 --> 19:55.709
Well, it's probably
the mom hormones,

19:55.792 --> 19:57.417
but you're pretty hot

19:57.500 --> 20:00.291
when you do
that dorky dad stuff.
