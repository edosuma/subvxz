00:39.740 --> 00:43.027
Just your nose
and then we're done, Mr. Frost.

00:46.507 --> 00:48.597
You butt-fucker!

00:54.173 --> 00:56.031
I'm a baby.

01:21.207 --> 01:24.460
Boys! It's dinner time. Come inside please.

01:26.740 --> 01:31.736
Hey, Mom. I know I said that
I would stay home and pack tonight...

01:31.816 --> 01:33.964
Yeah, of course I'm wearing headphones.

01:35.640 --> 01:39.917
Anyway, yeah, so surprise!
I'm not home. Um...

01:39.997 --> 01:42.727
The Lerners asked me to babysit. What?

01:42.807 --> 01:46.160
Sneak off and see Ricky?
Why would you... why would... why...

01:46.240 --> 01:47.936
Shit!

01:52.107 --> 01:53.664
Sorry.

01:55.173 --> 01:58.427
<i>Ashley! Ashley, are you okay?</i>

01:59.057 --> 02:02.304
Hi, Mom, no, no, no, everything's fine.
It's just traffic.

02:02.384 --> 02:05.797
Mom, look, I gotta go. I love you.

02:15.673 --> 02:19.560
Yeah, come here, come here.
Come on, give me a challenge.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.760
Oh, that's right, you can't,
'cause I'm the best.

02:22.840 --> 02:25.393
- Okay, here we go.
- Damn, I'm on a streak!

02:25.473 --> 02:28.893
"Want to put her in the mood?
Watch a horror movie.

02:28.973 --> 02:31.393
"When we're scared,
our brains pump out dopamine...

02:31.473 --> 02:33.527
"...the same chemical we release
when we're aroused."

02:33.607 --> 02:35.927
So fear really makes girls wet?

02:36.007 --> 02:37.933
- Told ya.
- Bam!

02:38.013 --> 02:40.497
You believe everything you read online.

02:41.907 --> 02:44.631
- It's like with the paint cans.
- Oh, my God...

02:44.711 --> 02:48.930
...are we seriously back to the paint
can debate? I ended that last week.

02:49.010 --> 02:51.693
- I was unconvinced.
- No, no, no, no, no, we looked it up.

02:51.773 --> 02:55.560
That ER doctor said that the paint can
would've smashed the robber's face in.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.727
Just admit you're wrong.

02:58.007 --> 03:00.308
Only reason to read
this stuff is for the pictures.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.427
It's a plus. I know what women want.

03:02.507 --> 03:05.427
- Dude.
- What?

03:05.507 --> 03:08.260
She's, like, twice our age.
I really don't think it's gonna happen.

03:08.340 --> 03:11.160
Five years. Big deal.
My parents are five years apart.

03:11.240 --> 03:14.493
You don't get it.
Luke, Ashley's a ten. A solid ten.

03:14.573 --> 03:17.664
And you're like a fi...

03:20.407 --> 03:22.763
- Never mind.
- She likes me, I know it.

03:22.843 --> 03:25.064
- It's tonight or never.
- Okay, go ahead.

03:25.144 --> 03:28.327
But my brother gave me weed, so instead
of trying to bone your babysitter...

03:28.407 --> 03:30.760
...maybe we could just,
you know... puff-puff?

03:30.840 --> 03:33.227
No, man, I'm going through with the plan.

03:33.307 --> 03:35.197
Don't mess it up for me.

03:36.673 --> 03:40.831
I mean, Luke, for both our sakes,
I truly, sincerely hope you get some ass...

03:41.540 --> 03:45.360
...sistance... uh, with that
computer problem you got.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.327
Like, technical assistance.
Call, uh, Geek Squad.

03:48.407 --> 03:50.927
- They're good.
- Real smooth, Einstein.

03:51.007 --> 03:54.127
- You smell great, Mrs. Lerner.
- Don't you have a curfew, Garrett?

03:54.207 --> 03:56.927
- Yeah, but my mom said I could stay in...
- Bed by 11:00, okay?

03:57.007 --> 04:00.060
- I know.
- And don't forget to brush your teeth.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.147
I will, Mom.

04:01.227 --> 04:04.031
- I left pizza money.
- Okay!

04:15.940 --> 04:17.531
Robert.

04:18.839 --> 04:21.692
Robert, turn that shit off.
It's giving me a migraine.

04:21.773 --> 04:27.643
Yes, uh, darling. My ornaments were
conspicuously missing from the tree.

04:27.723 --> 04:29.727
We're not putting those on the tree.

04:29.807 --> 04:33.427
Bell shoes, or I'll chop
your legs off below the knees.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.397
Are you sure you've never
sucked another man's cock?

04:37.273 --> 04:40.593
Not even in college? Not some lost weekend?

04:40.673 --> 04:44.960
Fishing trip? Secret, special friend? Ever?

04:45.040 --> 04:48.360
- Not that I can recall.
- Because, honestly, Robert, this is so...

04:48.440 --> 04:50.260
Meterosexual?

04:50.840 --> 04:54.093
That's not even the word.
It's metro. Metrosexual.

04:54.173 --> 04:57.560
- I'm allowed to like gay things.
- I need a drink.

04:57.640 --> 05:00.050
Oh, my God, the fetus machine!

05:01.520 --> 05:03.687
I forgot you still had this.

05:05.207 --> 05:07.490
What the fuck? Dude!

05:07.570 --> 05:11.197
That is so creepy. I'm sorry. Please
tell me you don't still sleep with this.

05:12.107 --> 05:13.427
- You totally do.
- Shut up, dick.

05:13.507 --> 05:15.893
- You so do.
- Of course not.

05:15.973 --> 05:19.060
Hey, maybe it'll put you in the mood
while you're, you know...

05:22.340 --> 05:23.647
She's here.

05:26.273 --> 05:29.493
Good Lord, you are breathtaking.

05:29.573 --> 05:31.327
- Thank you.
- Nice sweater.

05:31.407 --> 05:33.161
- Thanks, nice tie.
- Thank you.

05:33.241 --> 05:36.078
So, uh, you're leaving us.
Deandra says that you're moving.

05:36.158 --> 05:40.264
- Yeah, in a couple of days, to Pittsburg.
- Did I give you permission?

05:42.907 --> 05:45.940
So thank you for coming
because you've gotta be busy packing.

05:46.020 --> 05:48.960
Yeah, but I mean, I couldn't
leave without saying goodbye.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.827
- Wow! What a nice thing to say.
- Mrs. Lerner, you look incredible.

05:52.907 --> 05:56.593
Well, thank you.
But I told you, call me Deandra.

05:56.673 --> 05:59.497
"Mrs. Lerner" makes me sound fossilized.

06:00.540 --> 06:01.960
Robert!

06:02.040 --> 06:04.693
Oh, look who decided to come out of his room.

06:04.773 --> 06:06.960
Don't I remember something about
the trash getting taken out?

06:07.040 --> 06:09.264
And don't forget the shovel.

06:13.427 --> 06:15.220
Go on, Luke, and then we can hang out.

06:15.300 --> 06:18.731
Yeah, come on, you grab the garbage
and I'll get the recycling.

06:22.273 --> 06:24.327
I don't know about you,
but I'm gonna miss that girl.

06:24.407 --> 06:26.264
New carpets!

06:26.973 --> 06:28.864
Damn it, Rob.

06:29.607 --> 06:31.360
Here we go.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.627
Okay, I want to show you this. We're going
to do things a little bit differently.

06:34.707 --> 06:37.227
- Lucas has been sleepwalking again.
- Oh.

06:37.307 --> 06:38.860
No, crap!

06:38.940 --> 06:40.831
Just a minute.

06:42.340 --> 06:44.860
Garrett, what are you doing in here?

06:44.940 --> 06:49.347
Oh. Uh, do you have any itch cream?

06:50.140 --> 06:52.660
- My shoulder really...
- Top shelf.

06:52.740 --> 06:55.093
Honestly, that kid is a bad influence.

06:55.173 --> 06:57.560
I want you to keep an eye on him.

06:57.640 --> 07:01.827
Once he's brushed and he's in bed, don't
forget to give him his sleeping pill, okay?

07:01.907 --> 07:06.060
Then you take this pencil and you put it
on his door handle. See? Like that.

07:06.140 --> 07:10.193
That way, if he stays in, great.
If he walks around, we know.

07:10.273 --> 07:13.781
And what he doesn't know can't hurt him.

07:14.807 --> 07:17.631
- Honey, it's time to go!
- All right.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.660
Okay, Ashley, call us
if you need anything, all right?

07:22.740 --> 07:25.593
See ya. Good luck.

07:26.073 --> 07:29.427
Now, don't stay up and watch scary movies,
okay? It'll give you nightmares again.

07:29.507 --> 07:31.460
Please don't do that.
You're embarrassing the lad.

07:31.540 --> 07:34.560
- Robert, that tie.
- I know, right!

07:34.640 --> 07:39.087
No, wrong. Please, please, please? Thank you.

07:42.440 --> 07:44.313
Always be...

07:45.220 --> 07:46.760
...prepared.

07:48.440 --> 07:50.357
Please don't embarrass me like last year.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.294
I promise.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.164
Finally.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.393
So what do you wanna do?

07:57.473 --> 08:00.647
- Movie?
- Actually, I gotta make a call.

08:00.727 --> 08:03.797
So how about you hang out
and play video games or something?

08:12.507 --> 08:15.164
This is just happening so fast, you know?

08:16.140 --> 08:18.193
I just need some space tonight.

08:18.273 --> 08:22.364
Like, clear my head, say goodbye to
everything, if that makes any sense.

08:25.307 --> 08:27.731
Ricky, of course I wanted to see you.

08:28.940 --> 08:32.126
I don't know. 11:30.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.626
Well, if you want to break
a few dozen perv laws...

08:34.707 --> 08:37.393
...you could always ignore me
and come over anyway.

08:37.472 --> 08:40.059
Ricky, no, that was a joke. No, don't.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.059
Luke! Luke!

08:43.140 --> 08:45.797
- What?
- There's a spider. Kill it.

08:47.540 --> 08:49.797
Just kill it. Squish it!

08:52.440 --> 08:54.531
It didn't do anything wrong.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.027
<i>Ash!</i>

08:59.673 --> 09:02.060
<i>Ashley! Ashley, are you okay?</i>

09:02.140 --> 09:03.664
What?

09:04.707 --> 09:07.153
I can handle myself just fine, thank you.

09:07.233 --> 09:09.264
The answer's still no.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.560
Go on. You're free now.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.727
There you go, big guy.

09:15.807 --> 09:17.727
Ricky, I know.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.088
Yes, I know I leave soon.

09:21.707 --> 09:25.555
You know you're my guy.
Can't we hang out tomorrow?

09:28.573 --> 09:30.221
Okay.

09:31.607 --> 09:35.055
Okay. Okay, well, maybe
if kiddo falls asleep early.

09:36.973 --> 09:40.021
Okay. All right, bye.

10:04.207 --> 10:05.755
Luke?

10:08.373 --> 10:09.921
Luke!

10:12.773 --> 10:14.821
Luke, where are you?

10:22.207 --> 10:24.655
Luke, where are you?

10:34.840 --> 10:36.393
Luke!

10:36.773 --> 10:40.193
- Lucas, what are you doing?
- Oh, you won't?

10:40.273 --> 10:42.627
No, you are way too young
to be drinking. Give me that.

10:42.707 --> 10:45.793
- Oh, this?
- Yes, that. Give it to me.

10:45.973 --> 10:49.021
Lucas, stop! What has gotten into you?

10:50.973 --> 10:53.527
One time me and Garrett drank a whole bottle.

10:53.607 --> 10:56.593
He puked so bad.
He can't hold his liquor like me.

10:56.673 --> 10:59.721
Wow, I'm super impressed, okay? Now, give it.

11:01.473 --> 11:03.888
Lucas, I'm so serious right now.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.327
Don't.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.221
Thank you.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.460
Oh, my God.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.393
Pardon me.

11:22.707 --> 11:25.188
You forgot to shut the door, doofus.

11:40.873 --> 11:43.155
I can't believe I'm doing this.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.593
Hey, no, sorry, I can't...
I can't talk right now.

11:50.673 --> 11:53.103
He just opened a bottle of champagne.

11:53.407 --> 11:55.860
Uh-uh, no, that is not an invitation.

11:56.540 --> 12:00.521
Look, um, listen, I don't think
tonight's gonna work out.

12:00.607 --> 12:04.513
A chance to what? Make things harder
than they already are? What?

12:05.573 --> 12:09.388
Okay, you know what? That was a low blow,
and I'm gonna hang up now.

12:19.147 --> 12:20.440
Busted.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.260
Me? What about you, mister?

12:23.340 --> 12:25.588
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

12:26.507 --> 12:28.355
Okay, deal.

12:32.407 --> 12:36.808
You know, drinking won't impress me, okay?
I already think you're pretty cool.

12:39.073 --> 12:42.288
Let's, uh... let's get
some food into you, hey?

12:42.740 --> 12:46.221
- Pepperoni or Hawaiian?
- Anything but mushrooms.

12:48.873 --> 12:50.960
Why don't you start the...

12:51.440 --> 12:54.856
Whoa, calm down. Have another drink.

12:57.973 --> 12:59.855
Lerner residence.

13:01.540 --> 13:03.088
Hello?

13:03.507 --> 13:05.088
Hello?

13:13.273 --> 13:16.055
<i>Help! Somebody help me!</i>

13:18.707 --> 13:20.688
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

13:26.407 --> 13:29.088
- Who was it?
- No one.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.527
Why are you dating Ricky?

13:34.607 --> 13:36.108
He's such a jerk.

13:38.607 --> 13:41.960
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.921
How did you mean it?

13:45.707 --> 13:48.793
It's just like first Jeremy and now Ricky.

13:49.173 --> 13:52.039
You could choose any guy in the world,
and you're choosing these guys...

13:52.119 --> 13:54.327
- ...who treat you like shit.
- Luke...

13:54.407 --> 13:56.627
...first off, you're sweet...

13:56.707 --> 13:59.993
...but second, there's actually
a really wonderful side to Ricky.

14:00.073 --> 14:04.060
And my move's been really
tough on us, so be nice.

14:04.140 --> 14:06.393
Plus, you're drunk, kiddo.

14:06.473 --> 14:09.927
I am not drunk and I am not a kiddo.

14:10.307 --> 14:13.188
- You're 12.
- Thirteen in a few weeks.

14:15.940 --> 14:19.188
- I'm mature for my age.
- I know.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.793
If I were your age, I'd date you.

14:22.873 --> 14:24.388
Really?

14:30.607 --> 14:33.220
Shit! I forgot to order the pizza.

14:40.573 --> 14:42.897
God, Luke, you didn't tell me
you ordered something.

14:42.977 --> 14:44.848
I didn't.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.193
Hi. Sorry, we didn't order that.

14:49.273 --> 14:51.593
This 312 Claremont?

14:51.673 --> 14:54.460
- Yeah.
- Well, someone ordered this.

14:54.540 --> 14:58.021
It was probably my dad.
Here, keep the change.

15:00.473 --> 15:03.127
Hey, you, uh... you have a pleasant night.

15:03.207 --> 15:05.088
Okay, thanks.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.491
Plates and napkins, mister...

15:09.640 --> 15:11.688
I fuckin' hate this thing.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.260
- <i>You come here a lot?</i>
- <i>Every now and then.</i>

15:23.340 --> 15:25.560
<i>Come here to think, be by myself.</i>

15:25.640 --> 15:28.093
What? It's good ambience.

15:28.173 --> 15:30.655
You are something else tonight.

15:36.607 --> 15:40.288
Wait, if your dad ordered the pizza,
why is there mushrooms on it?

15:41.273 --> 15:43.455
I don't know, 'cause they're like vegetables?

15:46.507 --> 15:49.735
- <i>Hey, you mind grabbing those beers?</i>
- <i>Sure, hold on.</i>

16:02.073 --> 16:03.621
<i>Hello?</i>

16:05.507 --> 16:07.555
<i>Cindy, don't be stupid.</i>

16:13.923 --> 16:17.263
<i>My boyfriend's going to kill me
if I don't get home soon.</i>

16:17.773 --> 16:20.055
<i>Your boyfriend isn't here.</i>

16:22.607 --> 16:24.430
<i>You're bad.</i>

16:32.973 --> 16:35.993
So what are your family's
plans for the holidays?

16:36.073 --> 16:38.112
Drinking and arguing.

16:39.502 --> 16:41.321
You crack me up.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.055
Ricky, why can't you just leave me alone?

16:50.273 --> 16:52.688
Look, I'll be back in one second, okay?

16:54.373 --> 16:55.960
Hello?

16:56.640 --> 16:58.660
Oh, you crack me up.

16:59.440 --> 17:02.288
Okay, we'll see.

17:03.807 --> 17:06.494
Yeah, I don't know. I said, "We'll see!"

17:07.607 --> 17:10.426
Hey, I'm still pissed at you, you know.
You don't get off that easy.

17:10.507 --> 17:14.555
I'll talk to you later, maybe. Okay, bye-bye.

17:17.772 --> 17:19.279
Hey...

17:19.858 --> 17:22.492
...you'll always be my little buddy.
You know that, right?

17:22.573 --> 17:26.458
- Can we just watch the movie?
- <i>Hey, where'd you go?</i>

17:27.973 --> 17:30.427
<i>Bobby, are you up there?</i>

17:31.607 --> 17:34.488
Oh, my God! No, I can't!
I can't watch this part.

17:37.240 --> 17:40.396
Why would... why would they go
into the attic? It's just...

17:40.476 --> 17:42.497
...oh, it's so stupid.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.293
Oh, God!

17:52.473 --> 17:55.921
- Did you hear that?
- Mmm-mmm.

18:04.773 --> 18:07.693
Luke, Luke, Luke, no! No, no, no, Luke.

18:07.773 --> 18:09.860
- Why?
- No, just because, Luke.

18:09.940 --> 18:12.393
- I know you've been drinking...
- So have you, so why won't you kiss me?

18:12.473 --> 18:15.555
Because, Luke, it is the most
inappropriate thing ever!

18:16.773 --> 18:18.360
Okay?

18:24.140 --> 18:25.988
Lerner residence.

18:31.140 --> 18:34.355
- Are you gonna talk?
- <i>I can see you.</i>

18:36.540 --> 18:38.260
Is this Jeremy?

18:38.340 --> 18:40.327
<i>Joey, is that you?</i>

18:41.207 --> 18:44.455
If you can see me,
how many fingers am I holding up?

18:45.607 --> 18:49.160
<i>No, let's get out of here.
There's somebody out there.</i>

18:49.840 --> 18:53.327
- <i>There's somebody over there!</i>
- Luke, could you just turn that off?

18:53.407 --> 18:55.693
- Why?
- Can you just, please?

18:55.773 --> 18:58.855
<i>Come on, let's go.
There's somebody out there...</i>

18:59.273 --> 19:02.329
Can you... give me that. Luke?

19:05.040 --> 19:06.855
Was it Jeremy?

19:08.007 --> 19:09.888
I don't think so.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.121
Then who was it?

19:14.673 --> 19:17.727
Everyone knows he's totally
obsessed with you.

19:19.773 --> 19:21.304
What the fuck!

19:22.207 --> 19:25.255
Where's the hose?
I'm spraying whoever's out there.

19:34.373 --> 19:36.388
Luke, get my phone!

19:37.996 --> 19:40.127
- Oh, goddamn it, Luke!
- Oh, shit! Sorry!

19:40.207 --> 19:42.760
- God, do you know how much that cost me?
- I didn't mean to.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.973
8 Plus. Do you not look when you're throwing?

19:45.053 --> 19:47.721
Ashley, my mom'll buy you another one.

19:49.307 --> 19:51.121
Oh, Luke!

19:51.773 --> 19:55.460
- What, I'm not scared.
- Yeah, well, we don't know who it is.

19:55.540 --> 19:57.421
Then look.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.660
No one's there.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.888
What the hell?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.525
Luke, no! Don't. What are you... Luke!

20:09.605 --> 20:13.255
Whoever's out there, cut it out.
I know tae kwon do.

20:15.507 --> 20:17.760
See? Scared 'em...

20:20.907 --> 20:23.093
Hi. How are you?

20:23.173 --> 20:25.008
Get off me!

20:25.388 --> 20:28.872
Dude! Your guy's faces!
Your faces. You were like...

20:28.952 --> 20:30.760
- You asshole!
- What the hell, man?

20:30.840 --> 20:34.093
- Come on, I'm just checking up on you kids.
- I nearly called the fucking police!

20:34.173 --> 20:36.027
What were you doing
sneaking around back there?

20:36.107 --> 20:37.393
- Back where?
- In the backyard.

20:37.473 --> 20:39.730
I didn't go in the backyard.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.421
Stay here.

20:47.907 --> 20:50.988
- What was that?
- I... I don't...

20:51.973 --> 20:54.427
- Hey, hey, hey, what's that for?
- Luke, where's your phone?

20:54.507 --> 20:56.927
- My parents took it.
- I have one.

20:57.007 --> 21:01.693
Okay, dial 911. I'm going up there.
If I scream, press send and hide, got it?

21:01.773 --> 21:03.321
Okay.

21:05.573 --> 21:08.655
Dude, if this is a prank,
I'm kicking you in the balls.

21:15.540 --> 21:18.162
- Jesus! What are you doing? Stay down there.
- We heard something.

21:18.242 --> 21:22.088
- Please don't leave us alone.
- Okay, but just stay right behind me.

21:41.007 --> 21:43.231
Where did the noise come from?

22:00.807 --> 22:02.411
Oh, my God.

22:06.407 --> 22:09.488
Someone's about to spend
Christmas in fucking jail.

22:14.807 --> 22:16.355
What?

22:17.007 --> 22:19.221
My phone always works here.

22:23.340 --> 22:24.668
What?

22:28.140 --> 22:31.827
What the fuck? Where's the computer?

22:32.307 --> 22:34.673
- Guys!
- It's in my room.

22:35.173 --> 22:38.388
We need the police. If this is Jeremy,
I'm not even fucking around.

22:39.007 --> 22:42.127
- Shit.
- What the hell? Where's FinnAndJake?

22:42.207 --> 22:45.527
- What's that?
- The network. It's gone.

22:45.607 --> 22:48.234
- How are they doing this?
- Okay, Luke, come with me.

22:48.314 --> 22:51.093
Garrett, stay here and just get
on another one of those like...

22:51.173 --> 22:52.327
- Wi-Fi?
- They're all locked.

22:52.407 --> 22:56.727
No, God, Garrett!
Just use your fuckin' techno magic.

22:56.807 --> 23:00.621
Hey. Hey! What the fuck's that supposed to...

23:01.890 --> 23:03.733
Jesus Christ!

23:04.473 --> 23:08.288
Okay, we just need to find the security
panel, and the cops'll be here in minutes.

23:10.540 --> 23:12.660
How the hell don't you have
a security system?

23:12.740 --> 23:15.293
We never needed one.
It's a really safe neighborhood.

23:15.373 --> 23:18.660
Okay, we'll just take my car.
We'll grab it and we'll, um...

23:19.940 --> 23:21.755
What is it?

23:23.507 --> 23:25.921
Stay back. Get against the door.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.827
Garrett! Garrett!

23:30.907 --> 23:33.321
Garrett, what are you doing? Get down!

23:33.640 --> 23:37.055
Garrett, get away from the window!

23:37.573 --> 23:40.421
- It was on the other side.
- What was?

23:44.240 --> 23:46.088
What the fuck is that?

23:48.073 --> 23:49.955
Did you hear that?

23:50.840 --> 23:53.477
Get upstairs.
Everybody get upstairs. Move! Shit!

23:53.557 --> 23:56.893
- I'm getting out of here.
- Garrett, come back! Garrett!

23:56.973 --> 23:58.470
Garrett!

24:15.173 --> 24:17.263
What happened to Garrett?

24:34.307 --> 24:36.155
Is he hurt?

24:42.510 --> 24:44.227
Listen, okay?

24:44.307 --> 24:46.593
We're gonna... we're gonna go upstairs, okay?

24:46.673 --> 24:49.427
In the bedroom and lock the door and hide.

24:49.507 --> 24:51.293
And then what?

24:51.373 --> 24:54.460
And then what? We're going to scream
out of the window, okay?

24:54.540 --> 24:57.093
We're going to scream as hard as we
can until the neighbors can hear...

24:57.173 --> 25:00.927
- ...and then they'll call the cops.
- What if they shoot us?

25:01.007 --> 25:03.493
What if it makes them come inside?

25:03.573 --> 25:05.053
Look at me.

25:05.133 --> 25:08.821
I need your help,
and I need you to stay calm.

25:09.440 --> 25:12.647
- We're gonna get through this, okay?
- Okay.

25:12.727 --> 25:15.360
- Do your parents have a gun?
- Yeah.

25:15.440 --> 25:17.593
Where do they keep it?

25:17.673 --> 25:20.460
By my parents' bed, Dad's side.

25:20.540 --> 25:24.560
Okay, we get the gun.
And if anyone tries to come inside, we'll...

25:25.240 --> 25:27.288
...you know, we'll shoot 'em.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.460
Okay.

25:30.540 --> 25:32.055
Okay.

25:53.873 --> 25:56.521
Hug the wall and stay in the shadows, okay?

26:02.040 --> 26:03.921
There's someone there.

26:45.073 --> 26:46.875
What are they doing?

26:50.707 --> 26:52.588
What do they want?

26:57.707 --> 26:59.555
What do we do?

27:04.240 --> 27:06.855
Go, go, go, go, go, go. He's coming!

27:44.240 --> 27:45.960
Okay.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.720
Okay, Luke, we're just going
to stay here until they leave.

27:48.800 --> 27:52.293
They killed Garrett.
What if they kill my parents, too?

27:52.373 --> 27:57.814
No. Lucas, that is not going to happen, okay?

27:58.873 --> 28:01.696
- I think we should get the gun.
- No, Luke...

28:01.776 --> 28:05.801
...the guys down there have
a shotgun, okay? No, we're staying here.

28:06.740 --> 28:10.493
What are you doing? Stay here! Jesus, Luke.

28:10.673 --> 28:13.460
Lucas! Seriously!

28:13.540 --> 28:16.422
Luke, they can hear us. Where are you?

28:16.502 --> 28:18.493
- Shit, something's on me. Luke!
- What?

28:18.573 --> 28:20.593
- Oh, shit, something's on me!
- What is it?

28:20.673 --> 28:22.183
Shit!

28:22.263 --> 28:25.193
No, no, on my face! Get it off!

28:25.273 --> 28:27.318
- Ash, look at me!
- Get it off! Get it off!

28:27.398 --> 28:29.393
Look at me!

28:29.473 --> 28:32.321
I got you. You're going to be okay.

28:49.240 --> 28:52.893
- I can't do this.
- I've just gotta get my dad's gun.

28:53.573 --> 28:55.388
Then we'll be okay.

28:56.040 --> 28:57.921
It's okay.

28:58.173 --> 29:00.060
It's okay to cry.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.821
I'm scared, too.

29:04.573 --> 29:07.903
- But I have to get the gun.
- Wait, no.

29:07.983 --> 29:09.493
Wait.

29:39.407 --> 29:41.655
Quick! I think he's downstairs.

29:49.073 --> 29:51.960
- Is that loaded?
- Yeah, I checked.

30:03.173 --> 30:04.655
No!

30:12.667 --> 30:14.888
Okay, go, go, go.

30:17.928 --> 30:20.627
You stay here. I'm gonna go out there
and I'm gonna scare them away.

30:20.707 --> 30:24.360
- No, no, Luke, stay here.
- Don't worry, I'll protect you.

30:24.940 --> 30:27.922
Luke, going out there's not
brave, okay? It's stupid. Luke!

30:28.002 --> 30:30.460
- Trust me. Let go of me.
- Luke, come back!

30:31.023 --> 30:32.887
- Oh, my God!
- Shit!

30:32.967 --> 30:35.160
- Can you turn it off?
- It won't.

30:50.167 --> 30:52.055
Go away.

30:53.907 --> 30:55.755
Go away.

30:57.307 --> 30:59.321
Luke, I'm so sorry.

31:09.907 --> 31:11.955
Please go away.

31:22.373 --> 31:24.271
That's your mask.

31:29.607 --> 31:32.095
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

31:32.175 --> 31:34.988
- Ash, no!
- Garrett!

31:35.640 --> 31:37.888
Ah, dude?

31:40.107 --> 31:42.188
Take that mask off!

31:51.140 --> 31:52.693
What?

31:52.773 --> 31:55.360
What? Is this a fuckin' joke?

31:55.440 --> 31:57.493
I... we were gonna scare you.

31:57.573 --> 32:00.973
Yeah, you did. You scared the shit out of me.
Why? Why? Why would you do that?

32:01.053 --> 32:03.827
I was gonna go save you, but dipshit here...

32:03.907 --> 32:06.267
Luke, your friend is holding a real gun!

32:06.347 --> 32:09.487
- This is serious. How could you do that?
- Because you treat me like a child.

32:09.567 --> 32:12.127
And what, you were going to show me
how much of a man you were by...

32:12.207 --> 32:16.427
...rescuing me from fake armed robbers?
You are a child!

32:16.507 --> 32:18.588
I almost broke my neck.

32:21.273 --> 32:24.427
What delusional infant thinks
that staging a break-in...

32:24.507 --> 32:26.955
...is gonna get you to second base?

32:28.273 --> 32:30.160
You're mental!

32:30.240 --> 32:34.846
You're a selfish brat with no consideration,
and you need therapy. Lots of it.

32:37.767 --> 32:40.793
I'm gonna go and put
your dad's hunting stuff...

32:40.873 --> 32:45.560
No, Garrett, you stay right fucking there.
Luke, you are in so much trouble.

32:45.640 --> 32:47.488
I'm calling your parents.

32:51.273 --> 32:52.627
Ashley.

32:52.707 --> 32:56.005
- Ashley! Ashley!
- What?

33:01.873 --> 33:03.955
Dude, what'd you just do?

33:09.940 --> 33:11.988
What the fuck did you just do?

33:40.273 --> 33:43.555
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I'm moving so fast!

33:51.140 --> 33:56.693
Whoa! Okay, uh, kill-fuck Mary
with the Adventure Time chicks.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.288
Go.

34:00.473 --> 34:02.393
Fuck Princess Bubblegum.

34:02.473 --> 34:05.827
- What? Not Marceline?
- Hell no.

34:05.907 --> 34:09.293
One, she's made of bubble gum so she can,
like, stretch, which leads to two...

34:09.373 --> 34:13.688
- ...her pussy tastes like bubble gum.
- Ooh, dude, that means she's all, like...

34:13.768 --> 34:16.493
...like sticky and moist and shit.

34:16.572 --> 34:20.460
- Dude, those are pros.
- Where'd you learn that, your mom?

34:20.540 --> 34:22.360
No, your sister.

34:23.040 --> 34:26.393
Further, everyone from the Candy
Kingdom is ravenous for flesh...

34:26.473 --> 34:29.083
...so you know she gives legendary head.

34:29.690 --> 34:32.938
Yeah, as long as you don't mind
cutting gum out of your pubes.

34:33.806 --> 34:36.581
Not that you have to worry about that.

34:40.907 --> 34:43.141
Oh, my God, dude.

34:44.072 --> 34:46.955
You gotta have one of these. It's like...

34:48.107 --> 34:50.155
...it's like marshmallows.

34:52.806 --> 34:54.293
Everywhere.

34:54.373 --> 34:56.893
Maybe I should have given you a half dose.

34:56.973 --> 35:00.293
- What'd you call it again?
- Oxy.

35:00.373 --> 35:03.588
Oxy. It's awesome.

35:04.423 --> 35:08.427
It's awesome. Awesome,
awesome, awesome, awesome.

35:09.407 --> 35:10.993
Awesome.

35:11.073 --> 35:12.955
Is that a word?

35:15.673 --> 35:17.663
Oh, I gotta do that again.

35:18.173 --> 35:20.660
I'm gonna go and explore.

35:23.140 --> 35:25.960
Watch the carpet!
Dammit, my mom will kill me!

35:26.040 --> 35:29.327
- Sorry.
- Just get out of there.

35:29.807 --> 35:31.655
Come on.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.284
Sure you know what you're doing?

35:38.040 --> 35:39.555
Always.

35:42.107 --> 35:43.723
Something's missing.

35:43.803 --> 35:46.255
What the fuck is going on?

35:56.307 --> 36:00.393
Jesus! How many different
lotions do you have?

36:12.273 --> 36:14.027
There.

36:14.107 --> 36:15.860
All better.

36:15.940 --> 36:17.893
Dude, that's fucked up.

36:17.973 --> 36:21.621
Come on, it's hilarious.
What do you think, Ashley?

36:22.423 --> 36:26.649
Oh, thank you, Luke.
I've literally never looked better!

36:29.807 --> 36:32.793
You're probably wondering what's going on.

36:32.873 --> 36:34.727
It's out in the open now.

36:34.807 --> 36:37.055
You know how I feel about you.

36:39.207 --> 36:40.453
Look...

36:40.533 --> 36:44.618
...I really, really don't
want to shoot you, Ashley...

36:44.973 --> 36:46.843
...but I will.

36:46.923 --> 36:50.960
So if I take the gag off,
you won't scream, right?

36:51.740 --> 36:55.421
'Cause then I have no other choice
but to shoot you, and like I said...

36:56.473 --> 37:00.055
...I really, really don't want to.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.288
You get me?

37:10.440 --> 37:13.627
- Luke, listen to me, okay?
- Uh-uh-uh. I didn't say talk.

37:13.707 --> 37:15.955
You talk when I tell you.

37:35.873 --> 37:38.360
Okay. Talk.

37:38.440 --> 37:41.260
Luke, listen to me, okay?
I think I have a concussion.

37:41.340 --> 37:45.143
I need to go to the hospital.
Put the gun down and untie me.

37:45.223 --> 37:48.860
- This needs to stop immediately.
- No.

37:48.940 --> 37:52.267
Whatever you think that you're
gonna get away with, you're not.

37:52.347 --> 37:55.267
Ashley, you used to tell me
I could get away with murder.

37:55.347 --> 37:58.055
- Luke!
- I'm just kidding. God, Ashley.

37:58.135 --> 38:00.980
Lighten the fuck up. I'll tell you what.

38:01.060 --> 38:04.183
- Let's play truth or dare.
- How about you untie me right fucking now?

38:04.263 --> 38:06.475
Language, Ashley.

38:07.107 --> 38:10.827
If you win, I will untie you,
but if you lose...

38:10.907 --> 38:13.555
...well, if you lose...

38:14.573 --> 38:16.588
...then you drink this.

38:17.973 --> 38:19.821
What is that?

38:20.307 --> 38:23.593
We'll call it my insurance policy.

38:24.573 --> 38:27.260
Isn't it amazing what you can get
on the playground these days.

38:27.340 --> 38:29.593
Luke, I have known you since you were eight.

38:29.673 --> 38:32.262
You're threatening me with a gun tonight.
This is not okay.

38:32.342 --> 38:36.893
Whatever. Neither is, like,
political corruption in West Africa.

38:36.973 --> 38:40.127
By the way, I need help
with that paper. It's due Monday.

38:40.207 --> 38:42.097
Okay, Ashley, I'll go first.

38:42.177 --> 38:44.720
- Truth or dare?
- I dare you to grow up.

38:44.940 --> 38:47.393
Truth or dare, Ashley?

38:47.773 --> 38:50.021
Don't make me point the gun at you.

38:50.973 --> 38:52.855
This is so stupid.

38:55.340 --> 38:58.390
- Truth.
- I knew you'd say that.

38:58.470 --> 39:01.641
Okay, truth. How many guys have you fucked?

39:01.721 --> 39:03.793
What? Luke, what are you doing?
This isn't you.

39:03.873 --> 39:05.921
Just answer the question.

39:08.120 --> 39:10.393
- None.
- Bullshit! You're not a virgin.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.227
Everybody knows you screwed Jeremy.

39:12.307 --> 39:16.293
No, I broke up with him because he
went around telling everybody that.

39:16.373 --> 39:19.360
Okay. Guess it's my turn then.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.455
Uh, Luke, truth or dare?

39:22.373 --> 39:24.793
Well, it'll be dare of course.

39:24.873 --> 39:27.688
Okay. Um...

39:30.373 --> 39:32.480
I dare you to touch her tit.

39:34.240 --> 39:38.621
- No, please don't do that.
- It's the universal rules, Ashley.

39:42.397 --> 39:44.252
Do you have a preference?

39:48.840 --> 39:51.088
Right or left?

39:53.207 --> 39:55.855
Fine, I'll pick.

40:02.473 --> 40:06.313
Oh, that is nice.

40:07.007 --> 40:09.455
I can see what all the fuss is about.

40:10.767 --> 40:12.192
Dude, are you...

40:14.723 --> 40:18.260
- Shut up!
- Hey, hey. Hey, why are you shoving?

40:18.340 --> 40:22.060
Don't push me, dude. I will kick your ass.

40:22.140 --> 40:24.355
Okay. Okay.

40:29.407 --> 40:31.893
It's pretty nice, huh? How'd that feel?

40:31.973 --> 40:34.421
Like a little boy just felt me up.

40:36.007 --> 40:37.521
Ashley...

40:39.907 --> 40:43.233
...do you know what it's like to love
someone who doesn't love you back?

40:43.313 --> 40:45.578
- More than you'd know.
- No, you don't. Everyone loves you.

40:45.658 --> 40:49.927
- All the guys wanna fuck you.
- Oh, Luke. You are in so much trouble...

40:50.007 --> 40:52.821
...the both of you,
when your parents come home.

41:04.773 --> 41:07.849
They're never going to find out.

41:14.573 --> 41:16.388
Your turn.

41:18.307 --> 41:22.155
- Luke, truth or dare.
- Why isn't anybody asking me?

41:23.540 --> 41:24.593
Truth.

41:24.673 --> 41:27.721
Did you ever tell Garrett
that you killed his hamster?

41:28.540 --> 41:30.430
- What?
- The answer is no. Next turn.

41:30.510 --> 41:33.260
You said LeBron escaped
out of the hole in my screen.

41:33.340 --> 41:36.960
- He did. He was just dead first.
- What the fuck, man?

41:37.040 --> 41:39.888
It was an accident and besides,
it was, like, two years ago.

41:39.968 --> 41:42.827
You have a cat now
so he would have died anyway.

41:43.207 --> 41:45.688
Garrett, truth or dare?

41:46.440 --> 41:48.260
Why would you lie to me?

41:48.640 --> 41:50.521
Truth or dare?

41:52.873 --> 41:54.393
Dare.

41:54.973 --> 41:57.355
Dare, and you'd better dare us to...

41:57.435 --> 41:59.797
- ...to make out or something.
- Not on your life.

41:59.877 --> 42:03.193
- Why not? Why do you get to have all the fun?
- Because she's my babysitter.

42:03.273 --> 42:05.727
- You don't touch her.
- Then what am I even doing here, dude?

42:05.807 --> 42:08.893
We were just gonna scare her
and now this has turned into, like, shit.

42:09.673 --> 42:13.121
What if we get caught?
Look, I don't like this, man.

42:16.873 --> 42:18.388
Really?

42:20.740 --> 42:22.760
Dude, stop! What are you doing?

42:22.840 --> 42:25.427
Dude, I'm done, man. I just wanna go home.

42:25.507 --> 42:28.593
No, no, no, you can't go now.
We have to finish this.

42:28.673 --> 42:31.393
This isn't as much fun
as you said it would be.

42:31.473 --> 42:35.093
What if someone finds out?
You know what they do to white kids in jail.

42:35.173 --> 42:38.727
Garrett, listen to me.
You're an accomplice now.

42:38.807 --> 42:41.527
You'll get caught if you don't help me.

42:41.607 --> 42:45.350
We have to stick to the plan.
She won't remember any of this, trust me.

42:45.430 --> 42:49.455
Fine. Let's just... let's get this over with.

42:52.440 --> 42:53.788
Shit!

42:57.007 --> 42:58.555
Shit!

43:05.973 --> 43:09.188
Aw, so close.

43:13.973 --> 43:18.455
So, because you cheated,
here's what's gonna happen.

43:20.107 --> 43:23.365
When my parents get home, they'll find you...

43:23.445 --> 43:27.593
...passed out and realize
that after I went to sleep...

43:27.773 --> 43:30.434
...you raided the liquor cabinet
and partied hard...

43:30.514 --> 43:33.363
...before your big move to Pittsburg.

43:34.140 --> 43:36.993
Exhibit A and Exhibit B.

43:37.573 --> 43:39.402
And in the morning...

43:40.032 --> 43:42.236
...you won't remember any of this.

43:42.940 --> 43:45.860
Luke walked me through. It's the best way.

43:45.940 --> 43:48.460
Luke is taking you straight
to jail with him, Garrett.

43:48.540 --> 43:52.727
You're making a big mistake. Just run.
Call the cops now. You can stop this.

43:52.807 --> 43:55.427
- Drink.
- Hard pass.

43:55.507 --> 44:00.127
Come on! You love drinking.
You drink with Ricky all the time.

44:00.207 --> 44:02.021
What's the problem?

44:04.640 --> 44:06.293
Eyes up here.

44:06.873 --> 44:09.566
If you drink, all of this goes away.

44:10.073 --> 44:12.121
We don't have to do this.

44:13.290 --> 44:14.821
Drink.

44:17.273 --> 44:18.993
Oh, you bitch!

44:20.607 --> 44:21.727
Help!

44:21.807 --> 44:25.221
No, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

44:28.307 --> 44:29.860
Stop.

44:31.840 --> 44:34.760
Stay calm, and stay here and clean this up.

44:34.840 --> 44:36.327
Okay.

44:36.407 --> 44:38.593
Hey, hey.

44:40.640 --> 44:43.527
- Who is it?
- I'm here to see Ashley.

44:44.007 --> 44:47.227
- Ricky?
- Yeah, man, open the door.

44:47.307 --> 44:50.293
- She's not here.
- Listen, I know she's in there.

44:50.373 --> 44:53.393
She texted me to come over,
like, half an hour ago.

44:53.473 --> 44:55.488
She doesn't want to see you.

44:56.073 --> 44:59.093
- I just wanna talk to her.
- Go away.

44:59.473 --> 45:01.693
She doesn't love you anymore.

45:02.073 --> 45:03.921
She told me.

45:06.407 --> 45:07.993
Ashley!

45:08.073 --> 45:11.493
- Ashley, come out and talk to me!
- Dude, shut up! She doesn't want to see you.

45:11.573 --> 45:14.060
All right. All right.

45:14.140 --> 45:17.221
Hey, listen, man.
Could you just give her these, please?

45:19.473 --> 45:22.493
Fine. Pass them through the door.

45:22.773 --> 45:26.021
All right, awesome. Thanks, man.

45:28.373 --> 45:30.294
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Hey, get out!

45:30.374 --> 45:32.150
Ash!

45:32.230 --> 45:34.079
You have pizza?

45:39.673 --> 45:41.227
Ash!

45:41.807 --> 45:44.655
Dude, what the... why is that music so loud?

45:45.073 --> 45:46.621
Ash!

45:46.840 --> 45:48.660
Are you hiding?

45:49.640 --> 45:52.455
- 'Cause I'll find you!
- No! She's upset.

45:52.940 --> 45:55.393
Dude, I know that.
What do you think these are for?

45:55.473 --> 46:00.093
- So she can't see you till tomorrow.
- Be quiet please. Please, please!

46:00.173 --> 46:02.055
Dude, why not?

46:04.907 --> 46:07.393
Hey, I got... I got the rat.

46:07.473 --> 46:10.227
The big rat.
The fucker was fast, but I got him...

46:10.307 --> 46:12.248
Where is she?

46:12.328 --> 46:13.960
Where's Ash?

46:14.040 --> 46:17.780
Upstairs, but it's probably better
if you come back tomorrow. No!

46:17.860 --> 46:20.305
It's not just you. She has cramps.

46:21.040 --> 46:23.721
- What?
- Menstrual cramps.

46:24.673 --> 46:27.488
- It's real bad.
- Yeah, she has diarrhea, too.

46:29.707 --> 46:31.255
Oh.

46:31.607 --> 46:34.137
Ash! I'm gonna come up!
I don't care what you have.

46:34.217 --> 46:36.583
- Fucking diarrhea?
- Sorry, dude. What do we do?

46:36.663 --> 46:39.688
I don't know. Just stay with her.

46:49.807 --> 46:51.488
What the hell are you doing?

46:56.007 --> 46:58.255
That was so not cool.

47:07.040 --> 47:08.555
Ash!

47:09.473 --> 47:12.451
- Dude, where the hell is she?
- I told you, she doesn't want to see you.

47:12.531 --> 47:16.355
Ashley! Come on, you don't
have to be embarrassed.

47:19.573 --> 47:21.121
Babe!

47:22.240 --> 47:24.224
Don't you, have like...

47:24.304 --> 47:27.180
...some tampons, or something?

47:31.310 --> 47:33.493
Dude, what happened...

47:48.273 --> 47:50.355
What the fuck?

47:51.773 --> 47:53.293
Hey!

47:53.473 --> 47:55.167
What the fuck are you doing?

48:00.073 --> 48:01.460
What have you done with her?

48:01.540 --> 48:03.640
Hey, where is she?

48:13.373 --> 48:15.227
You're fuckin' dead,
you little piece of shit!

48:15.307 --> 48:18.360
Hey, hey, hey! Ah, drop it. Drop it.

48:18.740 --> 48:22.327
I'm serious. I'll blow
your fuckin' face off in three, two...

48:22.407 --> 48:24.621
All right, all right, all right.

48:25.773 --> 48:27.927
Whoa, man! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

48:28.007 --> 48:31.345
- Okay, don't shoot me, okay?
- Okay, get on your knees. Please.

48:31.425 --> 48:34.921
- Okay, okay. All right, all right!
- Please, get on your knees.

48:36.207 --> 48:37.993
Okay, thank you.

48:38.073 --> 48:41.255
- He lines up the shot.
- No, no, no! Luke!

48:44.307 --> 48:46.860
What the fuck? Holy shit! What do we do now?

48:46.940 --> 48:51.327
- Isn't this exciting?
- No! No, dude, we're going to jail.

48:51.407 --> 48:53.460
Don't you get it?
We're going to fucking jail!

48:53.540 --> 48:57.355
- Luke, we're gonna fuckin' die in prison.
- No, we're not.

49:06.040 --> 49:07.148
Fuck!

49:19.003 --> 49:21.255
Why can't we just roofie them both?

49:22.373 --> 49:24.627
That was all I had. And even if it wasn't...

49:24.707 --> 49:27.793
...Jiffy Lube here
has a fucking hole in his face.

49:27.873 --> 49:30.327
You really messed things up, Ricky.

49:30.407 --> 49:34.093
Things just got a whole lot more
complicated for me and Garrett.

49:42.223 --> 49:43.760
Ah.

49:44.640 --> 49:47.060
- Just let Ricky go.
- We both know I can't do that.

49:47.140 --> 49:49.600
We can say that he fell
on an exposed nail or something.

49:49.680 --> 49:52.730
Garrett can go with him to verify
the conversation with his roommate.

49:52.810 --> 49:54.927
You and I, we stay here, we clean up.

49:55.007 --> 49:57.093
You go to bed before your parents
get home and then...

49:57.173 --> 50:00.660
You call the cops and they
arrest me in my jammies.

50:00.740 --> 50:02.827
I don't think so, Ash.

50:03.107 --> 50:05.155
What if she's serious?

50:06.473 --> 50:10.560
- Dude, she can help us get out of this.
- You got a lot to learn about women.

50:10.640 --> 50:13.260
Why didn't you listen? I said I'd text you.

50:13.340 --> 50:16.560
- You did text me.
- What?

50:16.640 --> 50:18.655
Check my phone.

50:20.807 --> 50:23.760
- You texted him.
- What are you talking about?

50:23.840 --> 50:26.100
You don't want us to get out of this.
You invited him here!

50:26.180 --> 50:28.540
- Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
- Luke, what the...

50:31.140 --> 50:34.753
- You texted Ricky to come here, didn't you?
- No, man. Why would I do that?

50:39.807 --> 50:44.268
Okay, I did. I was gonna tell you, but
Grease Monkey got here 15 minutes early.

50:44.348 --> 50:46.164
Caught me off guard.

50:46.244 --> 50:49.960
- Lighten up. I got it all planned out.
- Yeah, what else you got planned?

50:50.040 --> 50:53.080
- What else are you gonna lie to me about?
- Garrett, go take a walk...

50:53.160 --> 50:55.455
...and chill the fuck out.

50:58.807 --> 51:01.936
Garrett? Garrett, no,
please don't go. Please.

51:02.016 --> 51:04.087
Just take another oxy if you have to.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.848
Oh, look.

51:18.140 --> 51:20.027
Your phone still works.

51:20.107 --> 51:23.068
It's about time we invite our second guest.

51:23.873 --> 51:25.960
The douchebag ex.

51:26.340 --> 51:27.855
Jeremy?

51:31.707 --> 51:33.755
Invite him here.

51:35.040 --> 51:37.275
I'm not asking.

51:41.540 --> 51:43.093
You're not going to shoot me, Luke.

51:43.173 --> 51:46.127
I will shoot you, Ashley,
if you don't invite him here...

51:46.207 --> 51:48.855
...right now.

51:49.540 --> 51:51.460
Sorry, kiddo.

51:51.540 --> 51:54.055
I'm not involving anyone else
in your bullshit.

52:01.507 --> 52:03.055
Fine.

52:09.240 --> 52:12.393
God, please don't pick up. Please
don't pick up. Please don't pick up.

52:12.473 --> 52:14.860
Please don't pick up. Please don't pick up.

52:14.940 --> 52:17.388
No, not again with the duct tape.

52:18.407 --> 52:20.621
1,001 uses for duct tape.

52:26.907 --> 52:29.168
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Jeremy.

52:29.873 --> 52:31.960
<i>Uh, who's this?</i>

52:32.040 --> 52:34.427
I'm actually calling for Ashley.

52:34.507 --> 52:37.357
<i>There's no Ashley here, dude. Wrong number.</i>

52:39.040 --> 52:41.827
Oh, my God, what a moron!

52:41.907 --> 52:44.188
I can't believe you dated this guy.

53:00.340 --> 53:03.160
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Jeremy, don't hang up.

53:03.240 --> 53:05.992
I'm here with Ashley.
She wants to talk to you...

53:06.072 --> 53:08.180
- ...but not on the phone.
- <i>Who is this?</i>

53:08.260 --> 53:12.327
She's being all weird.
I think she wants you to come over.

53:12.407 --> 53:16.093
- She's babysitting me and...
- <i>Is this that little taint on Claremont?</i>

53:22.773 --> 53:24.360
- Yes.
- <i>Tell her to stay there.</i>

53:24.440 --> 53:27.478
- <i>I'm coming over right now.</i>
- Okay, come around the back.

53:32.340 --> 53:34.635
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

53:39.007 --> 53:41.473
Luke. Luke, listen to me, okay?
You don't know what you're doing.

53:41.553 --> 53:43.927
If you don't stop,
someone's going to get hurt.

53:44.007 --> 53:46.893
Don't you remember
when you killed Garrett's hamster?

53:46.973 --> 53:50.588
You cried when you told me about it.
You were sad.

53:59.673 --> 54:01.721
It wasn't an accident.

54:02.240 --> 54:03.921
As if.

54:04.386 --> 54:05.852
Say it, you grease monkey loser.

54:05.932 --> 54:09.127
You actually think Ashley's
gonna remember you in a year?

54:09.207 --> 54:13.452
Whatever you just said,
say it again, I fucking dare you.

54:14.903 --> 54:17.988
I said... I need the bathroom.

54:20.507 --> 54:22.825
Gross! Stop it!

54:33.073 --> 54:34.921
Fucking mongo!

54:52.643 --> 54:56.693
- God, I'm getting us out of here.
- Ash, as soon as you're free, you run.

54:56.773 --> 54:59.788
I'm serious, don't turn back.
I can handle myself.

55:00.907 --> 55:02.988
Listen. Keep cutting.

55:05.173 --> 55:08.527
Look, I know you've been avoiding me 'cause
you've got this whole future planned out.

55:08.607 --> 55:12.227
You know, you got college, you got a career.

55:12.307 --> 55:14.860
The kid's right. I don't have those things.

55:14.940 --> 55:17.188
I just want you to know I'm happy for you.

55:18.440 --> 55:20.521
You're gonna be awesome.

55:23.473 --> 55:25.755
He's coming. Hurry!

55:33.273 --> 55:35.721
Dude, your piss reeks.

55:38.840 --> 55:42.031
Reeky. What the fuck you been eating?

55:43.173 --> 55:47.180
Jeremy lives, like,
30 minutes away, right? Ugh!

55:47.260 --> 55:48.755
We've got time to kill.

56:05.073 --> 56:06.621
Fuck!

56:07.307 --> 56:09.627
Yeah, fuck!

56:09.707 --> 56:13.893
I want to watch the two of you fuck.

56:13.973 --> 56:17.267
- Listen, you little shit...
- No, you listen to me.

56:17.347 --> 56:20.800
- I got the gun.
- Just let him play big boy. He likes that.

56:20.880 --> 56:26.320
Ashley says she's a virgin, but I bet you
hit that shit twice a day, right, Reeky?

56:32.207 --> 56:33.927
You haven't?

56:34.007 --> 56:36.421
Well, tonight's your night, guys.

56:36.907 --> 56:39.321
I'm just kidding.

56:39.907 --> 56:41.827
God, relax.

56:41.907 --> 56:43.788
I'm not a pervert.

56:53.467 --> 56:54.911
It's not piss.

56:58.740 --> 57:00.760
Garrett, what the fuck!

57:00.840 --> 57:03.513
What, man? You told me to calm down.

57:03.593 --> 57:05.727
Nobody's smoking weed in the house!

57:05.807 --> 57:08.593
Well, like, next time be more specific.

57:08.673 --> 57:11.327
You moron! My mom's gonna kill me!

57:11.407 --> 57:13.427
Stop bossing me around.

57:13.507 --> 57:15.160
- Give it to me.
- No.

57:15.240 --> 57:17.927
- Give it. Hey! Give it to me!
- No.

57:19.007 --> 57:22.621
- Hurry up!
- I am. Shit!

57:26.840 --> 57:29.374
- Puff.
- No, man. I don't fuck with that shit.

57:29.454 --> 57:31.093
Luke, just...

57:31.173 --> 57:34.660
Garrett, both of you guys, okay,
can we just talk and relax?

57:34.740 --> 57:37.627
I feel like there's a solution
that can make everybody happy.

57:37.707 --> 57:41.527
You're right. We all just need to relax.

57:41.607 --> 57:44.393
Ricky, you first.

57:44.473 --> 57:48.034
- I said no.
- Do you want a hit from the joint...

57:48.114 --> 57:49.970
- ...or a hit from the gun?
- Luke, stop it!

57:50.050 --> 57:52.055
I'm giving him a choice.

58:05.640 --> 58:08.455
- Whoa!
- That's awesome!

58:11.473 --> 58:13.223
Hey, stop it!

58:13.303 --> 58:15.593
What are you doing? Stop!

58:16.640 --> 58:19.097
The house smells like marijuana
so I need to get it in his system.

58:19.177 --> 58:21.625
- What do you mean, "In his system"?
- Garrett, come here. Help me pull.

58:21.705 --> 58:23.788
Where are you taking him?

58:30.140 --> 58:32.355
Stay there, smoke up.

58:39.507 --> 58:41.755
Dude, why do you hang out with this guy?

58:42.673 --> 58:44.488
Because he's my best friend.

58:45.807 --> 58:49.228
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

58:53.273 --> 58:54.693
You painting something?

58:54.773 --> 58:58.588
We're gonna see who's right
once and for all, MythBusters style.

59:16.007 --> 59:20.688
Hey, Garrett, in Scouts, were clove hitches
clockwise or counter-clockwise?

59:21.807 --> 59:25.488
- Clove who?
- Never mind. Got it.

59:26.123 --> 59:27.955
Got what?

59:29.673 --> 59:32.732
- Dude, what the fuck is going on?
- Dude...

59:33.312 --> 59:35.155
...I have no idea.

59:39.807 --> 59:43.760
- Whoa! What the fuck, man?
- Oh, you're fucking Home Aloning him?

59:43.840 --> 59:46.327
- Dude, what are you doing, man?
- Please, let me out of this.

59:46.407 --> 59:49.297
- Is it level with his head?
- What are you doing? You're gonna kill him!

59:49.377 --> 59:51.593
- Just stop it.
- Garrett. Garrett, right?

59:51.673 --> 59:53.293
- Yeah. Okay.
- Please untie me.

59:53.373 --> 59:56.293
You said that the paint can
would knock him back, like in the movie.

59:56.373 --> 01:00:00.517
Okay, I take it back. Everything I said,
I'm sorry. You win. Just stop it, please.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.655
Let's just try it one more time.

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.588
Ashley!

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:09.388
Oh, shit!

01:00:12.507 --> 01:00:14.427
- Blindfold him.
- No, no way, man.

01:00:14.507 --> 01:00:18.260
Dude, stop, man, stop! This is fucked!

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.660
Garrett, I'm warning you.

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:22.788
Blindfold him.

01:00:24.573 --> 01:00:26.793
Listen, man, whatever it is, I'm sorry.

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:29.300
All right? Luke, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for hitting you, man.

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:33.388
- Make sure it's good and tight.
- You don't have to do this, guys!

01:00:33.873 --> 01:00:36.143
You are fucking insane!

01:00:36.223 --> 01:00:38.688
- Ashley!
- Oh, fuck it!

01:00:39.423 --> 01:00:41.027
Ashley!

01:00:41.107 --> 01:00:43.527
Put it down, or I will shoot you!

01:00:43.607 --> 01:00:45.893
Thank God, Ashley, thank God.

01:00:45.973 --> 01:00:49.288
- I said, put it down!
- Okay.

01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:24.893
Oh, my God!

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:28.260
Holy shit, his head!
His head... it just exploded!

01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:30.867
I told you, Garrett. I told you!

01:01:32.007 --> 01:01:34.021
Why are you laughing?

01:01:35.307 --> 01:01:37.327
I said, why are you laughing?

01:01:37.407 --> 01:01:39.627
Because you can't shoot me, Ash.

01:01:40.007 --> 01:01:42.327
Don't come any closer, I mean it.

01:01:46.507 --> 01:01:49.988
A responsible parent always
keeps the ammo separate.

01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:55.288
Garrett, get her!

01:01:56.007 --> 01:01:58.405
If she gets away, we're both dead!

01:02:14.407 --> 01:02:17.180
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck!

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:19.793
- Hey, hey! Please, please!
- No! No!

01:02:19.873 --> 01:02:23.390
Hey, hey, just come back.
Just come back. Oh, hey! Fuck!

01:02:25.207 --> 01:02:27.633
Get off of me, you crazy fuck!

01:02:28.673 --> 01:02:31.327
- Hey!
- Get away from me!

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:33.127
Please. Please!

01:02:33.207 --> 01:02:35.427
- No!
- It would make everything easier, please!

01:02:35.507 --> 01:02:37.227
Let go!

01:02:37.307 --> 01:02:39.855
Ow! What the fuck?

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:49.961
No, no, no, no, no, Ashley! Ashley!
Ashley! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:02:53.797 --> 01:02:56.527
<i># Filling the air, oh, how they pound,
raising the sound...</i>

01:02:56.607 --> 01:02:58.193
Help!

01:02:58.573 --> 01:03:00.127
Help!

01:03:00.727 --> 01:03:03.760
<i># People sing songs of good cheer,

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:07.470

- Oh, thank you, that was wonderful!
- Thank you!

01:04:04.792 --> 01:04:08.060
- Hope the cocoa keeps your guys warm!
- Have a good night. Merry Christmas.

01:04:15.573 --> 01:04:18.360
There's a couple of new folks
in the group this year.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:21.088
Really improved their harmonizing.

01:04:22.907 --> 01:04:26.121
Oh, look who's awake.

01:04:28.773 --> 01:04:32.333
Tough break, Ash.
The carolers are gone, and...

01:04:32.713 --> 01:04:34.988
...the Lingards next door?

01:04:35.373 --> 01:04:37.421
Well, they're in Florida.

01:04:39.107 --> 01:04:41.155
I got rid of Ricky for you.

01:04:44.473 --> 01:04:48.175
It hurts now, but you'll thank me later.

01:04:55.473 --> 01:04:57.460
You like that?

01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.160
Mmm-hmm.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.888
Why did you kill him?

01:05:18.207 --> 01:05:21.460
Correction. You killed him
by smoking pot in the house.

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.693
That weed is evidence. You wanna go to jail?

01:05:24.773 --> 01:05:27.127
It was a fucking joint, dude.

01:05:27.207 --> 01:05:29.060
You didn't have to kill someone.

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:32.755
Garrett, we are going to get out of this.

01:05:37.273 --> 01:05:40.327
Remember when you ditched
fourth period and got caught?

01:05:41.507 --> 01:05:45.521
Who convinced them that you stopped
some vandals in the locker room?

01:05:46.407 --> 01:05:48.093
Me.

01:05:48.173 --> 01:05:51.427
When my mom caught us
stealing from her purse...

01:05:51.507 --> 01:05:54.121
...who faked sleepwalking
so you could slip out?

01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:58.493
- Say it.
- This is so much bigger.

01:05:58.573 --> 01:06:02.793
Dude, I am the Harry Houdini
of getting away with it.

01:06:02.873 --> 01:06:06.693
I know how tonight plays out,
and we get out clean.

01:06:06.773 --> 01:06:08.793
You just gotta do what I say.

01:06:09.273 --> 01:06:10.821
Okay?

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:20.188
I said, okay?

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.793
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:06:24.873 --> 01:06:26.688
Now, watch this.

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:31.155
Ashley is going to make a post.

01:06:31.873 --> 01:06:35.355
Something simple, like...

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:42.393
"Why can't exes just go away?
Jeremy is, like, freaking me out!"

01:06:45.457 --> 01:06:49.643
Now, all you gotta do is make sure
she stays quiet while I deal with Jeremy.

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:54.093
Deal with him? You mean kill him?

01:06:54.173 --> 01:06:57.388
Of course not! God, Garrett. Just...

01:06:58.107 --> 01:07:00.188
...we'll just plant a little seed.

01:07:01.073 --> 01:07:05.321
And after that, we'll get the paint off you
'cause you look like a fucking hot dog.

01:07:13.273 --> 01:07:14.927
I don't want to know.

01:07:15.307 --> 01:07:16.993
Garrett, please.

01:07:17.073 --> 01:07:19.555
Whatever it is, just please stop.

01:07:29.507 --> 01:07:31.055
Hmm.

01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:36.793
Hey.

01:07:36.873 --> 01:07:38.893
Hey, Ash. Hey.

01:07:38.973 --> 01:07:43.060
Hey, it's good to see you.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah!

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:47.560
We all good, yeah. Yeah, we cool.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:51.027
We're cool. Mmm, mmm, mmm!

01:07:51.107 --> 01:07:55.493
Yeah, we cool! Fuck yeah! Yeah!

01:07:55.573 --> 01:07:57.121
Yeah!

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:03.060
Ash! Ashley!

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:08.188
Fuck! What the fuck is that?

01:08:09.437 --> 01:08:10.971
Ashley!

01:08:12.007 --> 01:08:13.451
Ashley?

01:08:18.273 --> 01:08:19.821
Ashley?

01:08:25.939 --> 01:08:27.493
Ashley!

01:08:28.673 --> 01:08:31.426
Shh! Please.

01:08:31.506 --> 01:08:33.093
Ashley?

01:08:34.307 --> 01:08:37.587
Please be quiet, please be quiet.
Please. Please be quiet.

01:08:37.667 --> 01:08:39.535
Ashley, come on.

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:44.087
Ashley.

01:08:47.473 --> 01:08:49.720
- Ashley.
- Hi.

01:08:51.073 --> 01:08:55.160
Holy shit, man.
You scared the fuck out of me.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:57.370
- Where is she?
- Inside.

01:08:57.450 --> 01:09:00.460
- Okay, cool.
- Wait.

01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:04.388
- What?
- Just slow down. Come here.

01:09:04.872 --> 01:09:06.468
Have a seat.

01:09:08.006 --> 01:09:12.060
- No. Where's Ashley, dude?
- She's coming. Chill out.

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:15.188
She's just asked me
to come talk to you first.

01:09:32.807 --> 01:09:34.654
I just want tonight to be over.

01:09:53.107 --> 01:09:55.387
What the hell's that?
You said she wanted to see me.

01:09:55.467 --> 01:09:57.688
- She wants you to apologize.
- For what?

01:09:57.798 --> 01:10:01.027
- Shh! Don't wake the neighbors.
- I could give a fuck!

01:10:01.107 --> 01:10:03.460
A fuck about the fucking neighbors.

01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:05.755
She said that you'd know.

01:10:08.173 --> 01:10:10.725
Fine. Where is she? I'll apologize.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:15.351
She wants you to write it down.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.455
This is so fuckin' stupid.

01:10:29.707 --> 01:10:33.060
"Dear, Ashley.

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:36.155
"I'm sorry."

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:47.393
- That's it?
- What?

01:10:47.473 --> 01:10:49.360
What do you want me to say?

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.927
I'm just asking, is that it?

01:10:52.507 --> 01:10:54.988
Should I go tell her you're done?

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.255
Here, fuck.

01:11:06.307 --> 01:11:07.855
Shit.

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.288
"Ashley.

01:11:21.573 --> 01:11:23.788
"I am so sorry."

01:11:28.607 --> 01:11:31.493
- I don't know why I'm doing this.
- Because you're a good person, okay?

01:11:31.573 --> 01:11:35.060
And you didn't know any better and you
didn't know what he was capable of.

01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:39.727
Just untie me, okay? We'll run across
the street and we'll call the cops.

01:11:39.807 --> 01:11:41.893
But Luke will freak out
if he finds that you're gone.

01:11:41.973 --> 01:11:45.221
He won't hurt you. Okay? I won't let him.

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:50.727
- He's my best friend.
- No, he's not.

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:54.993
Luke doesn't give a shit about you, Garrett.
He uses you, he manipulates you.

01:11:55.073 --> 01:11:57.521
No friend would put you through tonight.

01:12:00.573 --> 01:12:03.221
There, she wants Shakespeare?

01:12:07.807 --> 01:12:09.321
Kid?

01:12:10.673 --> 01:12:12.488
I'm done!

01:12:14.407 --> 01:12:16.293
Hey, kid, where'd you...

01:12:16.373 --> 01:12:18.127
Fucking cat!

01:12:18.207 --> 01:12:20.288
Hey, kid, where'd you...

01:13:29.873 --> 01:13:32.693
- Ah! Ow!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:13:32.773 --> 01:13:36.255
I'm gonna... I'm gonna fix this, okay?
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:40.021
I'm really sorry, Ashley.

01:13:43.807 --> 01:13:46.430
I just wish I'd had the balls to step up...

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.121
I told you not to touch her, you asshole!

01:13:56.207 --> 01:13:58.060
You shot...

01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:01.393
- You shot me.
- Look what you made me do!

01:14:01.473 --> 01:14:03.627
I'm... I'm dying.

01:14:03.707 --> 01:14:07.640
Why did you make me do it?
Why did you make me do it?

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.553
Help! Help!

01:14:10.633 --> 01:14:14.401
- Help! Help!
- Shut up!

01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:21.188
I want my mom...

01:14:23.707 --> 01:14:26.193
Fuck! Fuck you!

01:14:26.273 --> 01:14:29.555
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:14:29.635 --> 01:14:32.027
Fuck! Shit!

01:14:32.107 --> 01:14:33.488
Fuckin' hell.

01:14:45.573 --> 01:14:47.788
He was starting to annoy me anyway.

01:15:02.173 --> 01:15:04.655
You were never going to let me go, were you?

01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:08.255
Guilty.

01:15:16.207 --> 01:15:20.255
I remember, my mom used to tuck me in.

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:24.312
I'd hold onto her and never let go.

01:15:26.073 --> 01:15:27.921
She felt so safe.

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.121
I'd just fall asleep.

01:15:36.707 --> 01:15:38.588
Then she stopped.

01:15:40.373 --> 01:15:42.227
I don't know why.

01:15:42.607 --> 01:15:44.364
And now...

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:47.415
...I don't sleep well anymore.

01:15:58.373 --> 01:16:00.855
I know exactly why she stopped.

01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:06.455
Why?

01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:15.571
Why?

01:16:16.007 --> 01:16:19.855
Open your eyes. Ashley, open your eyes.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:25.255
Just answer the question! Look at me!

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:30.821
Tell me I'm fucked up.
Tell me you're disappointed!

01:16:32.373 --> 01:16:35.988
Tell me you're scared or you
wanna go home. Say something!

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.788
Ashley.

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:44.855
Ashley.

01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:53.018
Please... say something.

01:17:28.373 --> 01:17:29.921
Goodnight.

01:19:11.673 --> 01:19:13.955
Shit, the hole in his cheek.

01:19:40.224 --> 01:19:41.788
Fuck!

01:19:43.673 --> 01:19:45.255
Fuck!

01:20:08.603 --> 01:20:11.888
What the... shit. Shit.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.288
Fuckin' deers!

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:25.027
It wasn't even funny, and Chantal and Dave...

01:20:25.107 --> 01:20:28.760
...could not stop talking about how
awful it was. I was so embarrassed.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.293
Oh, dude, they're just being cunts.

01:20:30.373 --> 01:20:32.138
- They're what?
- Nothing.

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:49.755
Are we talking about some sort...

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:56.821
We're not talking about sex, are we?
'Cause after this meal, I feel bloated.

01:21:28.773 --> 01:21:32.127
Oh, my God, where's Lucas? Oh, my God!

01:21:32.207 --> 01:21:33.755
Lucas!

01:21:35.107 --> 01:21:37.483
Lucas! Lucas!

01:21:56.773 --> 01:21:58.586
What's going on?

01:21:59.025 --> 01:22:02.460
I got you. I got you.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.121
It's an unspeakable tragedy.

01:22:06.407 --> 01:22:09.260
Do any of the parents know? Have they
been made aware? Garrett's parents?

01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:12.221
I was speaking to Garrett's
father just last week.

01:22:13.073 --> 01:22:14.927
Is there going to be a grief councilor?

01:22:15.007 --> 01:22:17.221
We'll arrange one for you, sir.

01:22:18.807 --> 01:22:21.127
This one's still alive!

01:22:21.207 --> 01:22:25.455
Okay, wait. Okay, honey,
just stay here, okay? Just stay here.

01:22:33.007 --> 01:22:35.088
Vitals are holding.

01:22:36.607 --> 01:22:39.793
- What have we got?
- Stab wound to the neck.

01:22:39.873 --> 01:22:42.360
She put duct tape on to stem the bleeding.

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:45.088
Smart girl. Saved her life.

01:22:56.507 --> 01:22:58.355
Let's go.

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:03.193
Mom, I'm worried about Ashley.

01:24:03.273 --> 01:24:05.825
I think we should go to the hospital.
