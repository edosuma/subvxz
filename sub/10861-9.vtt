WEBVTT

00:00.560 --> 00:02.240
There it is.

00:03.560 --> 00:05.920
It's a grave. 
 It's probably somebody's dog.

00:05.920 --> 00:07.800
Yeah, right. 
 There's only one reason

00:07.800 --> 00:11.080
- why you bury things out here. 
 - Why?

00:11.080 --> 00:13.040
Because you want to 
 hide the evidence.

00:13.040 --> 00:15.240
I'll bet my Michael Jordon 
 rookie card

00:15.240 --> 00:17.200
we find a maggot-ridden corpse.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.840
Really?

00:26.280 --> 00:29.560
- Aah! 
 - Run! Run!

00:29.560 --> 00:30.280
Ha ha!

00:32.520 --> 00:34.840
- Psych! 
 - Psych!

00:35.920 --> 00:39.480
Eric was the best. 
 "Run! Run!"

00:39.480 --> 00:42.320
- I wasn't that scared. 
 - Yeah, right.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.120
It was cruel and immature.

00:44.120 --> 00:47.560
Hey, excuse me for adding 
 a little fuel to the fire.

00:47.560 --> 00:50.160
Well, it wasn't funny.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.920
Speaking of fuel to the fire, 
 who's going tonight?

00:57.920 --> 00:58.680
Me.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.280
Ah! Another gore fest?

01:01.280 --> 01:05.160
My story's about a head 
 of a different sort--

01:05.160 --> 01:07.960
an ancient wizard's 
 good-luck charm.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.360
Pick it up, and the world 
 can be your oyster,

01:11.360 --> 01:13.240
but let the holder beware--

01:13.240 --> 01:17.600
this charm may be more 
 than you bargained for.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.560
Submitted for the approval 
 of the Midnight Society,

01:22.560 --> 01:24.680
I call this story...

01:34.920 --> 01:39.240
[Betty Ann] The story takes 
 place today, but it began years ago.

01:39.240 --> 01:45.120
In fact, it truly began centuries ago, 
 but I'm jumping ahead.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.080
[door opens]

02:23.080 --> 02:25.960
- [men talking] 
 - Over there!

02:25.960 --> 02:28.040
[footsteps]

02:31.080 --> 02:33.440
Come on. This way.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.840
[bell rings]

02:51.040 --> 02:52.960
[clock ticking]

02:56.960 --> 03:00.920
[Betty Ann] Dean Burkham was 
 the kind of guy who blended in.

03:00.920 --> 03:04.320
He didn't have many friends, 
 he didn't do sports,

03:04.320 --> 03:08.320
and he never joined anything. 
 He just kind of... was.

03:16.680 --> 03:21.080
And he wasn't so great 
 with schoolwork either.

03:25.480 --> 03:31.040
Mr. Burkham, 
 you are sinking to perdition.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.080
[Betty Ann] 
 One of Dean's only friends was Alix.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.280
Though she was 
 his complete opposite,

03:37.280 --> 03:40.000
they really connected 
 and had a great friendship,

03:40.000 --> 03:44.920
but it was a friendship about 
 to be put to the ultimate test.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.400
Thanks. 
 I'm useless today.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.080
You? Ha! 
 What's up?

03:49.080 --> 03:52.000
Another Crenshaw 
 chemistry catastrophe.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.320
- Ooh! Ugly. 
 - I studied hard for this.

03:55.320 --> 03:58.360
I don't get it, Al. 
 I can't catch a break.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.320
If you keep thinking that way,

04:00.320 --> 04:02.600
you're always going 
 to get dumped on.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.040
I know. I'm trying.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.960
I have a feeling your luck's 
 going to change soon.

04:07.960 --> 04:11.200
Great. Just as long as 
 it doesn't get any worse.

04:12.440 --> 04:16.320
[Betty Ann] In world cultures 
 class, there was a special guest--

04:16.320 --> 04:20.040
A famous archaeologist 
 named Dr. Oliver.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.800
Archaeology...

04:21.800 --> 04:25.360
the study of historic 
 or prehistoric peoples

04:25.360 --> 04:29.880
by analysis of their artifacts, 
 inscriptions, and monuments.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.200
The work is often painstaking,

04:32.200 --> 04:35.880
but the results can 
 take you on adventures

04:35.880 --> 04:39.160
that will stagger your imagination.

04:39.160 --> 04:44.360
For instance, the High Priests 
 of Babylon used this golden dagger

04:44.360 --> 04:48.680
to cut out the hearts of 
 slaves for their sacrifices.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.160
Ooh! Gross!

04:50.160 --> 04:53.920
This bowl was used for salt--

04:53.920 --> 04:58.280
not as a spice, mind you, 
 but as a weapon.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.800
Some ancient cultures 
 believed that salt

05:01.800 --> 05:09.000
was the best way to ward off evil... 
 sort of like garlic is to vampires.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.920
And this little prize 
 was recently excavated

05:14.920 --> 05:18.320
from an ancient Babylonian 
 sorcerer's temple.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.480
That thing belonged to a sorcerer?

05:21.480 --> 05:24.040
Inscriptions say that 
 this scepter belonged to Goth,

05:24.040 --> 05:26.280
a particularly nasty magician

05:26.280 --> 05:30.720
who enslaved thousands 
 to do his evil bidding.

05:30.720 --> 05:36.920
The writings say that following 
 Goth will bring you incredible fortune

05:36.920 --> 05:38.760
and good luck.

05:38.760 --> 05:42.920
Crossing him will lead 
 to your destruction.

05:46.960 --> 05:53.160
Of course, we don't believe 
 in such silly things today, do we?

05:54.480 --> 05:56.920
[bell rings]

05:59.880 --> 06:01.640
"Goth will bring you 
 incredible fortune

06:01.640 --> 06:04.200
or lead you to your destruction." 
 Who is she kidding?

06:04.200 --> 06:07.520
- I thought it was kind of cool. 
 - Give me a break.

06:07.520 --> 06:11.040
She's trying to make her job 
 sound more exciting than it really is.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.400
Maybe.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.120
I'm going to the library. 
 Want to come?

06:14.120 --> 06:16.120
Nah. 
 I got some stuff to do.

06:16.120 --> 06:17.800
OK. See you later.

06:30.440 --> 06:34.160
- Piqued your interest, did I? 
 - Yeah.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.840
It's become a passion for me--

06:36.840 --> 06:40.360
unlocking the secrets of 
 ancient civilizations.

06:40.360 --> 06:43.320
- It's pretty cool. 
 - Indeed.

06:43.320 --> 06:47.360
Take your time. 
 Don't be afraid to touch.

06:47.360 --> 06:52.760
Maybe I found another convert. 
 That's what I'm here for.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.000
You may begin.

08:39.159 --> 08:41.559
Yes, Mr. Burkham?

08:41.559 --> 08:43.720
Here's my test, Ms. Crenshaw.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.360
Is this supposed to be funny?

08:49.360 --> 08:52.640
Is there a problem, Ms. Crenshaw?

08:55.400 --> 08:56.480
Uh... no.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.160
No problem.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.560
Thank you, Mr. Burkham.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.080
Hey, Dean. Dean. 
 Wait up!

09:16.080 --> 09:19.640
What was that all about? 
 Why didn't you take the test?

09:19.640 --> 09:22.320
I did take it. I aced it.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.880
No way.

09:23.880 --> 09:28.080
What's the matter? 
 Don't think I can ace a test?

09:28.080 --> 09:32.160
Or maybe you think I'm useless, 
 just like everybody else.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.960
What? 
 What's wrong with you?

09:33.960 --> 09:38.080
Nothing's wrong with me. 
 Everything is finally right,

09:38.080 --> 09:40.200
and I'm going to 
 prove to everybody

09:40.200 --> 09:42.560
that I'm not the loser 
 they think I am.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.520
Dean!

09:44.520 --> 09:46.880
[Betty Ann] But something 
 was wrong with Dean,

09:46.880 --> 09:49.040
and Alix knew it.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.080
He wouldn't talk to her

09:52.080 --> 09:55.800
and started hanging 
 with a whole new group of kids.

09:55.800 --> 09:59.560
Then one day, 
 things took a very strange turn.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.360
Dean?

10:19.320 --> 10:21.840
Mercuric acid?

10:21.840 --> 10:24.360
What does he want with that?

10:58.880 --> 11:03.080
The acid is the medium.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.240
It creates the pathway.

11:11.840 --> 11:15.720
The Belladonna Plant 
 is the Nightshade.

11:17.080 --> 11:20.680
Together they create 
 the Mystic Vapors.

11:22.320 --> 11:26.200
The return of Goth is at hand.

11:26.200 --> 11:26.920
[thud]

11:28.120 --> 11:28.880
Go!

12:05.000 --> 12:08.600
Welcome, Goth, 
 ruler of the Nether Realm.

12:08.600 --> 12:12.760
I have waited centuries for an 
 apprentice such as you, young one.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.760
The Acolytes have been gathered.

12:14.760 --> 12:17.400
- We are ready. 
 - Excellent.

12:17.400 --> 12:22.800
There is one final task to be 
 performed before I am freed

12:22.800 --> 12:25.680
from this infernal 
 dimension of darkness.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.720
I await your command.

12:27.720 --> 12:32.480
Before the moon rises tonight, 
 you must gather the Nightshade

12:32.480 --> 12:37.200
and prepare the Cauldron. 
 The Mystic Vapors must be released.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.760
The Cauldron will be prepared.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.080
Do this, my young apprentice,

12:42.080 --> 12:45.760
and all that you desire 
 shall be yours,

12:45.760 --> 12:49.800
and the power of 
 the universe will be mine.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.640
[sinister laughter]

12:55.520 --> 12:58.320
[evil laughter]

13:00.520 --> 13:02.560
[furniture clatters]

13:02.560 --> 13:05.240
Stop her!

13:12.200 --> 13:14.560
Dr. Oliver! Dr. Oliver!

13:14.560 --> 13:16.520
She's gone, Alix.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.800
Ms. Crenshaw. 
 I have to talk to Dr. Oliver.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.640
She left yesterday on to a new 
 school and new minds to reach.

13:23.640 --> 13:26.320
Can I help you with something?

13:26.320 --> 13:29.080
Something really strange 
 is going on here.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.280
It's that scepter thing she brought.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.520
It's got Dean hypnotized 
 or something.

13:33.520 --> 13:38.280
Relax, child. 
 There's no reason to be alarmed.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.560
Join us...

13:40.560 --> 13:44.160
- and join Goth. 
 - Aah!

13:44.160 --> 13:47.600
[evil laughter]

14:04.040 --> 14:06.160
Hello, Alix.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.640
Don't be scared. 
 It's only me.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.920
I am scared. 
 What's going on?

14:12.920 --> 14:14.520
Dean, what are you doing?

14:14.520 --> 14:18.880
- You called it-- 
 - My luck finally changed.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.360
I'm not getting dumped on anymore.

14:23.360 --> 14:26.240
I'm in charge, 
 and I like it.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.960
You're not in charge. 
 It's this Goth.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.480
Goth has given me the power,

14:31.480 --> 14:35.320
and I'm using it to bring him back.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.440
Dean, he's a monster!

14:38.720 --> 14:41.560
Look at what I've done.

14:41.560 --> 14:46.040
People follow me now. 
 They take my orders.

14:46.040 --> 14:49.880
Half the school is with me, 
 even the teachers.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.760
Dean, look at me. 
 He's controlling you.

14:52.760 --> 14:56.640
You've got to come back 
 and fight this guy.

14:56.640 --> 15:00.000
- You're my best friend, Alix. 
 - I am.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.480
- Come back. 
 - That's why I'm going to let you go.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.800
Don't get in my way.

15:12.800 --> 15:17.400
It doesn't matter anyway. 
 You'll be one of us soon enough.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.600
Dean?

15:55.400 --> 15:57.120
Mercuric acid?

15:57.120 --> 15:59.640
Sorry, Dean. 
 It's police time.

15:59.640 --> 16:00.360
[gasp]

16:01.920 --> 16:04.760
Hurry. 
 The moon will rise soon.

16:08.520 --> 16:11.040
- Let me go! 
 - She followed us.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.920
- And she's ticked. 
 - Now, back off.

16:12.920 --> 16:17.320
- Are you crazy? 
 - I gave you one chance to escape, Alix.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.840
I won't give you another.

16:21.440 --> 16:25.800
- Put her in the van. 
 - Dean, wake up!

16:28.680 --> 16:31.280
Excellent. They're going 
 to boil her in that stuff?

16:31.280 --> 16:34.480
What is it? 
 Whatcha-ma-call-it acid?

16:34.480 --> 16:37.560
- Mercuric acid. 
 - I hate chemistry.

16:37.560 --> 16:40.520
The acid has to do with 
 those mystic vapors, right?

16:40.520 --> 16:43.120
- Maybe. 
 - So what happened next?

16:43.120 --> 16:45.040
Looks like Alix's goose is cooked.

16:45.040 --> 16:49.560
Alix may have been backed into 
 a corner, but she's resourceful.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.960
[Alix] 
 Where are we going?

16:53.960 --> 16:58.160
There's a place in this school 
 not many people know about.

16:58.160 --> 17:01.400
It's been closed off 
 for more than 25 years.

17:01.400 --> 17:04.640
They say a girl went mad in there.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.640
She broke into the school one night.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.040
The guards chased her all over.

17:13.040 --> 17:16.000
When they found her, 
 she was down here...

17:16.000 --> 17:18.280
totally out of her mind.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.599
The room's been 
 sealed off ever since...

17:25.599 --> 17:28.160
until tonight, that is.

17:29.240 --> 17:32.160
Got the key from the security guard.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.200
He is one of us now.

17:39.200 --> 17:43.400
It's the perfect place to make 
 our Cauldron of Mystic Vapors.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.000
- Excellent. 
 - Dean!

18:03.000 --> 18:05.240
Keep her here.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.880
The time has come.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.880
First we need the pathway.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.360
You two, help them.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.040
You've been so curious, Alix.

18:44.040 --> 18:48.280
I thought you'd want 
 to stay for the main event.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.120
Stop it, Dean! 
 Stop it now!

18:50.120 --> 18:52.600
Open the barrels!

18:52.600 --> 18:55.520
Pour the acid.

19:05.040 --> 19:09.400
Soon, my master. 
 You will be with us.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.080
The Belladonna leaves!

19:18.000 --> 19:19.360
Nightshade.

19:19.360 --> 19:22.400
Dean, better stop it, 
 or I'll smash this.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.280
Too late!

19:26.040 --> 19:28.920
I told you-- too late!

19:28.920 --> 19:32.080
I'm far too powerful now.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.280
[deep voice] 
 The Mystic Vapors.

19:43.280 --> 19:47.640
I've done it. 
 Rise, Mighty Goth!

19:47.640 --> 19:50.680
Your apprentice calls to you!

19:50.680 --> 19:51.400
Ahh...

19:54.680 --> 19:57.480
Yes! Come back.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.200
Heed ye, all who cross my path.

20:04.200 --> 20:10.120
Goth, Master of Stygian Arts, 
 has returned from exile

20:10.120 --> 20:15.400
in the Dark Nether World 
 to take my rightful place

20:15.400 --> 20:17.920
on the throne of humanity.

20:17.920 --> 20:21.680
Bow before me, 
 or feel my wrath!

20:21.680 --> 20:23.600
No! Go back!

20:25.840 --> 20:27.040
You!

20:27.040 --> 20:32.040
You are the one who interferes! 
 You must be eliminated.

20:32.040 --> 20:36.040
- Dean, help! 
 - Alix? What's going on?

20:36.040 --> 20:37.880
Do not interfere.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.640
The girl is mine.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.560
Alix, I'm stuck! 
 I can't move!

20:43.560 --> 20:47.120
Patience, my slave. 
 I will return for you soon enough.

20:47.120 --> 20:51.120
- Dean, do something! 
 - You should be honored.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.840
You shall be the first victim 
 of my reign.

20:53.840 --> 20:57.720
- Dean? 
 - Alix, the chlorine!

20:57.720 --> 21:00.360
Use the chlorine!

21:02.560 --> 21:05.560
Fear not. 
 The pain will not last long.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.440
Pour it in the pool!

21:10.000 --> 21:13.400
[Goth laughs sinisterly]

21:13.400 --> 21:20.480
Your human science 
 has no hope of...

21:20.760 --> 21:23.080
What's happening? 
 The Nightshade. It's...

21:23.080 --> 21:26.840
- [explosion] 
 - No!

21:38.960 --> 21:41.600
What happened?

21:50.120 --> 21:52.080
I'm sorry, Alix.

21:52.080 --> 21:55.840
It was like... 
 it was like he had control of me.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.560
I know.

21:57.560 --> 22:01.280
But how did you know 
 the chlorine would stop him?

22:03.240 --> 22:06.240
It was on Crenshaw's 
 chemistry exam.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.840
Chlorine kills Bacteria, 
 and the leaves were organic,

22:07.840 --> 22:12.320
so I figured it would zap him.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.840
I guess I was right.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.920
Yeah, I guess you were.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.040
Welcome back.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.080
I'm afraid we failed...

23:10.280 --> 23:15.120
But I planted jewels in 
 high schools all over the country.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.080
We'll have another chance.

23:17.080 --> 23:22.760
And to think when I was a young girl, 
 they thought I was mad!

23:22.760 --> 23:26.400
[laughs sinisterly]

23:32.800 --> 23:36.320
- The End. 
 - I smell a sequel.

23:36.320 --> 23:39.560
Yeah. 
 The world's doomed.

23:39.560 --> 23:41.800
Well, on that cheerful note,

23:41.800 --> 23:46.360
I declare this meeting 
 of the Midnight Society closed.
