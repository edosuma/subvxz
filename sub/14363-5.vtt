I'm sure he'll be right back.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.200
Mike...

08:37.268 --> 08:38.467
He ditched her.

08:38.534 --> 08:39.836
What?

08:39.904 --> 08:42.371
Yeah, he's gone. Your son
decided to go trick-or-treating.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.740
Aw, man.

08:43.807 --> 08:45.141
I'm calling his cell.

08:45.209 --> 08:47.310
I knew he wasn't ready for hanging.

08:47.378 --> 08:48.878
Hanging is a very s...

08:48.946 --> 08:50.880
[Cellphone vibrating]

08:55.085 --> 08:56.652
Tell me why we bought this, again.

08:56.720 --> 08:57.787
[Telephone beeps]

08:57.855 --> 08:59.088
He's blowing it, Mike.

08:59.156 --> 09:01.424
That's what he's doing. He's blowing it.

09:01.492 --> 09:02.825
Well, we're just gonna have to do something

09:02.893 --> 09:04.494
to entertain her until he gets back.

09:05.696 --> 09:07.330
Okay, follow me on this.

09:07.397 --> 09:08.598
Unless we don't.

09:08.665 --> 09:11.901
Look, Mike, he doesn't
exactly have a ton of options.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.270
You've heard about "the one that got away."

09:14.338 --> 09:17.106
<i>She might literally be "the one."</i>

09:22.778 --> 09:24.546
You know, Sue, it's getting pretty late.

09:24.614 --> 09:26.148
Maybe you should call it a night.

09:26.215 --> 09:28.717
No, Brad. You got to have faith.

09:28.784 --> 09:30.252
They'll come.

09:30.319 --> 09:33.855
They'll come, and my
college fund will grow.

09:33.923 --> 09:37.159
[Ringtone plays]

09:37.226 --> 09:38.126
Oh, no.

09:38.194 --> 09:39.294
What is it?

09:39.362 --> 09:41.229
Oh, no. This is the worst news ever.

09:41.297 --> 09:43.732
Okay, would you feel better
hearing it from Danny or Sandy?

09:43.799 --> 09:45.734
And do you want it sung,
like "Summer Lovin',"

09:45.801 --> 09:47.936
or spoken through, like
"Stranded At The Drive-in"?

09:48.004 --> 09:49.871
Can I maybe just hear it from Brad?

09:49.939 --> 09:51.406
[Sighs]

09:51.474 --> 09:53.141
I know why nobody's here, Sue.

09:53.209 --> 09:55.277
<i>Courtney and Debbie,
after not liking your idea,</i>

09:55.344 --> 09:57.579
<i>apparently did like your
idea enough to steal it.</i>

09:57.647 --> 09:59.347
They're showing "Poltergeist"
in the graveyard,

09:59.415 --> 10:00.615
and everybody's there.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.017
<i>And they don't just have popcorn.</i>

10:02.084 --> 10:05.310
They have... and I'm so
sorry I have to say this...

10:05.954 --> 10:06.987
Kettle corn.

10:07.055 --> 10:08.422
Seriously?

10:10.225 --> 10:12.526
Okay. No. You know what? It's fine.

10:12.594 --> 10:14.094
I mean, come on.

10:14.162 --> 10:18.065
A scary movie in a graveyard on Halloween?

10:18.133 --> 10:20.267
It's a little cliché, don't you think?

10:20.335 --> 10:22.342
You're right. You're right, Sue.

10:22.536 --> 10:23.770
<i>People will come.</i>

10:23.838 --> 10:25.572
And we will wait for
them as long as it takes.

10:25.639 --> 10:27.540
Even though I spent eight
hours on this costume,

10:27.608 --> 10:29.075
I don't care if nobody ever sees it.

10:29.877 --> 10:30.777
Just go.

10:30.845 --> 10:32.112
Oh! Thank you!

10:32.180 --> 10:33.947
Sandy and Danny may be
there collecting compliments,

10:34.015 --> 10:36.716
but Brad's heart stays right
here in this pumpkin patch.

10:36.784 --> 10:37.884
I promise.

10:44.525 --> 10:46.059
<i>...and adult elephants...</i>

10:46.127 --> 10:48.829
So, what do your parents do?

10:48.896 --> 10:50.463
I don't know.

10:50.531 --> 10:51.832
That's fine.

10:51.899 --> 10:53.800
You don't need to know
that. You're just a kid.

10:56.337 --> 10:58.772
Hey, are you hungry?
Can I get you something?

10:58.840 --> 10:59.873
A snack?

10:59.941 --> 11:01.341
I'll take some shrimp.

11:01.409 --> 11:05.111
<i>Well...We might have just run out.</i>

11:05.179 --> 11:07.147
Then nothing.

11:09.783 --> 11:11.050
You need to go get shrimp.

11:11.118 --> 11:12.518
- Shrimp?
- Yes... shrimp.

11:12.586 --> 11:14.754
Cindy's hungry, and the only
thing she wants is shrimp.

11:14.822 --> 11:16.089
<i>We don't even eat shrimp.</i>

11:16.156 --> 11:17.690
We're gonna go out and
get some stranger shrimp?

11:17.758 --> 11:20.426
She's not some stranger, Mike.
She's a girl who likes our son.

11:20.494 --> 11:22.028
I'm not getting shrimp.

11:22.096 --> 11:23.396
[Scoffs] Fine.

11:23.464 --> 11:24.530
<i>Then I will get the shrimp,</i>

11:24.598 --> 11:25.698
and you go in there and talk to her.

11:25.766 --> 11:27.200
Her name is Cindy. She has an older sister.

11:27.267 --> 11:29.335
- She doesn't know what her parents do...
- I'll get the shrimp.

11:32.373 --> 11:34.607
[Groans]

11:34.675 --> 11:36.709
Oh. Hey, dude. [Chuckles]

11:36.777 --> 11:39.545
So, you're trapped in here, too, huh?

11:39.613 --> 11:40.613
[Inhales deeply]

11:40.681 --> 11:42.482
'Sup? [Clicks tongue] I'm Axl.

11:42.549 --> 11:45.518
I don't know who you are, so
maybe I'll just call you...

11:45.586 --> 11:46.786
Lebron.

11:46.854 --> 11:50.456
Yep. Looks like I'm
stuck here till morning.

11:50.524 --> 11:52.024
But it's cool. Totally cool.

11:52.092 --> 11:54.260
I have the gift of
being able to fall asleep

11:54.328 --> 11:55.595
pretty much anywhere, so...

11:55.662 --> 11:57.663
Yeah. Night, Lebron.

11:57.731 --> 11:58.965
[Groans]

11:59.032 --> 12:00.566
Aah!

<i>Frankie: There comes a time when
faith can only take you so far</i>

[Sue shivering]

12:18.179 --> 12:19.621
Oh. Shoot.

12:20.148 --> 12:23.083
I must have missed the movie, huh?

12:23.151 --> 12:24.585
Oh! No! No, no, no, no!

12:24.653 --> 12:26.186
No, you are right on time.

12:26.254 --> 12:28.422
[Chuckling] Well, happy to hear that.

12:28.490 --> 12:31.492
I was at home trying to watch TV,

12:31.559 --> 12:32.626
but...Pbht!

12:32.694 --> 12:35.696
There's just too many buttons nowadays.

12:35.764 --> 12:37.264
Well, I'm really glad you came.

12:37.332 --> 12:38.465
Right this way.

12:38.533 --> 12:40.100
Let me show you to your hay bale.

12:40.168 --> 12:41.268
Ahh.

12:41.336 --> 12:44.104
Help yourself to a wheelbarrow of popcorn.

12:44.172 --> 12:48.003
And here is your ziplock
baggy of raisinets.

12:52.879 --> 12:54.246
[Door closes]

12:54.314 --> 12:55.314
Got the shrimp.

12:55.382 --> 12:56.715
Ah. Good, 'cause I'm dying here.

12:56.783 --> 12:58.684
I thought I could make
Cindy some caramel apples,

12:58.752 --> 13:01.186
but all I could find was a pack
of peeps and a black banana.

13:01.254 --> 13:02.421
And I ate the peeps.

13:02.489 --> 13:03.589
I have a problem.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.758
Well, we better get on this.

13:05.825 --> 13:07.326
The guy at the frugal Hoosier said

13:07.394 --> 13:09.295
this shrimp's got to be
eaten within the hour.

13:09.362 --> 13:10.796
You have any idea how to make this?

13:10.864 --> 13:12.898
I have no clue. We'll just throw
it in a pan with some butter.

13:12.966 --> 13:13.999
That works for everything.

13:16.436 --> 13:17.903
<i>Next year at this same time,</i>

13:17.971 --> 13:21.228
<i>I'll find a pumpkin patch that is real...</i>

13:21.407 --> 13:24.291
Gets better every time.

13:24.343 --> 13:26.978
It does, doesn't it?

13:27.046 --> 13:32.283
I always feel bad about
that, uh, Linus kid, though.

13:32.351 --> 13:33.985
He's so crushed

13:34.053 --> 13:36.888
when the Great Pumpkin
doesn't turn up at the end.

13:36.956 --> 13:38.156
Really?

13:38.224 --> 13:40.124
I don't think it's sad at all.

13:40.192 --> 13:41.459
To me, it just shows

13:41.527 --> 13:44.295
that you don't always
get what you hoped for,

13:44.363 --> 13:46.097
but you can still keep trying.

Uh...

13:48.300 --> 13:50.001
Oh. No. Please.

13:50.069 --> 13:51.836
You don't have to worry about that.

13:51.904 --> 13:54.873
I'm just glad that you came
and you had a nice time.

13:55.073 --> 13:58.275
After all the trouble you
went to to set this all up?

13:58.343 --> 14:00.311
No, no, no, no, no. I insist.

14:02.247 --> 14:06.548
All righty. I better get on with it.

14:08.252 --> 14:12.088
The Great Pumpkin may have
left some presents at my house.

[Clicks tongue]

14:16.760 --> 14:18.394
[Chuckles]

14:21.632 --> 14:24.567
Hey, Cindy. Look what I whipped up.

That's all you want?

14:33.143 --> 14:34.610
I'm good.

14:34.678 --> 14:36.112
Okay.

14:36.180 --> 14:39.315
'Cause, you know, it's kind
of a special, special thing...

14:39.383 --> 14:41.717
That we were so happy to make for you,

14:41.785 --> 14:45.123
because you're our guest and
we are so happy to have...

14:45.322 --> 14:47.056
Oh, look! Brick's back.

14:47.123 --> 14:49.959
I mean, we knew he'd be
back, but isn't that great?

14:50.026 --> 14:52.094
Brick, can I talk to you for a minute?

14:52.162 --> 14:53.229
Brick: Sure.

14:54.096 --> 14:55.597
What were you thinking?

14:55.641 --> 14:58.693
You don't just disappear
after you invite somebody over.

14:58.801 --> 15:01.403
A man doesn't treat a
woman he likes that way.

15:01.471 --> 15:02.604
Uh, no offense, mom,

15:02.672 --> 15:04.639
but I got a girl to come to my house.

15:04.707 --> 15:06.274
I think I'm doing all right.

15:06.342 --> 15:08.910
Yeah, but the goal is to get
her to come back a second time.

15:08.978 --> 15:11.880
I-it's about chivalry.

15:11.948 --> 15:12.948
Tell him, Mike.

15:13.015 --> 15:14.082
Brick, you like her,

15:14.150 --> 15:16.150
and you want her to like you back, right?

15:16.418 --> 15:18.186
In an ideal world, yes.

15:18.254 --> 15:20.855
Okay, so... you hold the door open for her,

15:20.923 --> 15:22.657
you help her out if she's
carrying something heavy,

15:22.725 --> 15:24.125
and you don't leave in
the middle of the date

15:24.193 --> 15:25.560
to go trick-or-treating.

15:25.628 --> 15:28.129
I asked her if she wanted to
go with me, and she said no.

15:28.197 --> 15:30.765
And that's why you needed to stay home.

15:30.833 --> 15:33.468
Why would I stay home if I wanted to go?

15:33.536 --> 15:36.471
Because as a man, you don't
get to do what you want.

15:37.439 --> 15:38.972
What? Why?

15:39.040 --> 15:40.874
You ever want to kiss her?

15:40.942 --> 15:42.876
I did enjoy that kiss
I got in north Carolina.

15:42.944 --> 15:44.845
Well, if you ever want
to get one in Indiana,

15:44.913 --> 15:46.714
you got to do all kinds of
things you don't want to do.

15:46.781 --> 15:48.315
What kind of things?

15:48.383 --> 15:50.684
Uh...Go see movies
you're not interested in,

15:50.752 --> 15:53.187
go to brunch, go to church,

15:53.254 --> 15:55.723
<i>do errands together, for some reason.</i>

15:55.790 --> 15:57.825
Uh... call the electric company,

15:57.892 --> 15:59.860
mute the game so she
can tell you her dreams.

15:59.928 --> 16:01.195
Okay, just to be clear,

16:01.262 --> 16:04.176
women do a lot of things
we don't want to do, either.

16:05.599 --> 16:07.867
Birthday.

16:07.935 --> 16:09.235
Eh.

16:09.303 --> 16:11.771
Wow. Getting a kiss is
sounding very complicated.

16:11.839 --> 16:13.806
Okay, okay. I get what you're saying.

16:13.874 --> 16:15.808
Chivalry... I'm on it.

16:15.876 --> 16:17.844
So I should probably get
back out there, right?

16:17.912 --> 16:19.879
Oh, my God. Yes. How
long have we been in here?

16:19.947 --> 16:20.947
Let's go. Let's go.

16:22.483 --> 16:24.450
How long until you get to start
doing things you want to do?

16:24.518 --> 16:26.019
I'll let you know.

16:37.131 --> 16:39.265
$50!

16:41.869 --> 16:43.336
Hey!

16:43.404 --> 16:45.204
[Laughs]

16:48.608 --> 16:49.742
All right.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.577
I know I kind of freaked out back there,

16:51.645 --> 16:54.847
but just so you know...
[Chuckles] I'm not that guy.

16:54.915 --> 16:57.149
I haven't needed a night-light
in, like, five years,

16:57.217 --> 17:00.352
so, yeah... not scared of anything, really.

[Chuckles]

17:01.888 --> 17:03.022
[Sighs]

17:03.089 --> 17:05.191
I think I'm just not used to being alone.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.560
I usually have my family or friends around.

17:08.627 --> 17:09.828
I'm a super-popular guy.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.229
I mean, I don't know if feather salesmen

17:11.297 --> 17:12.631
were popular in your time.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.500
I assume that's what you
are... a feather salesman.

17:15.568 --> 17:18.462
But yeah, spending time
alone is good, right?

17:18.737 --> 17:20.905
I mean, you're alone
with your thoughts, so...

17:21.573 --> 17:22.573

17:22.641 --> 17:24.375

17:24.442 --> 17:27.111

17:28.246 --> 17:29.380
Um...

17:31.016 --> 17:32.817
Been thinking a lot about college lately.

17:32.884 --> 17:34.718
Uh... [clears throat]

17:34.786 --> 17:36.954
Well...

17:37.022 --> 17:39.156
More about what happens
when college is over.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.091
'Cause, see, I'm a business major now,

17:41.159 --> 17:43.294
and I don't even really
know what that means.

17:43.361 --> 17:46.597
Uh, am I gonna be a businessman?

17:46.665 --> 17:48.799
Am I gonna go on business
trips with my briefcase

17:48.867 --> 17:50.868
and visit different
branches of my business?

17:50.936 --> 17:52.169
Or will I be one of those guys

17:52.237 --> 17:53.971
who owns some kind of outdoor business

17:54.039 --> 17:55.906
and visits jobsites in a cool windbreaker?

17:55.974 --> 17:58.309
I just think maybe if I
knew what I'd be wearing,

17:58.376 --> 18:00.244
I could work backwards from there,

18:00.312 --> 18:02.346
'cause no one is telling
me what I should do.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.468
[Chuckles] No one.

18:04.615 --> 18:05.915
I mean, your whole life,
people are telling you,

18:05.983 --> 18:07.283
"next year, you're
gonna go to kindergarten,

18:07.351 --> 18:08.551
then you're going to high school,

18:08.619 --> 18:09.953
then you're going to
college," and then, bam!

18:10.020 --> 18:11.254
People stop telling you
what you're supposed to do,

18:11.322 --> 18:12.522
and you're supposed to just figure it out.

18:12.590 --> 18:15.191
And all I know is, my
dad still ties my ties!

18:15.259 --> 18:16.993
How am I supposed to be a businessman

18:17.061 --> 18:19.028
if I can't even tie my own ties?

18:19.096 --> 18:21.397
[Chuckling] It's... ugh.

18:21.465 --> 18:23.399
[Sighs]

18:23.467 --> 18:27.337
The truth is, Lebron...

18:27.404 --> 18:28.671
I'm not sure my awesomeness

18:28.739 --> 18:30.640
is gonna translate into the real world.

18:31.775 --> 18:34.244
Maybe I...Peaked?

18:34.311 --> 18:36.379
[Exhales sharply]

18:36.447 --> 18:37.680
I just...

18:39.750 --> 18:41.851
<i>I don't know anything about my future,</i>

18:41.919 --> 18:43.620
and when I think about that...

18:43.687 --> 18:45.688
[Sighs]

18:45.756 --> 18:48.458
...I'm scared, man.

18:48.525 --> 18:50.960
I'm really scared.

18:51.028 --> 18:52.695
[Sighs]

18:58.259 --> 19:00.819
<i>Frankie: So, Axl made it through
his first real night alone.</i>

19:09.369 --> 19:10.469
[Groans]

19:12.872 --> 19:14.206
[Clears throat]

19:15.408 --> 19:16.642
Lates, Lebron.

19:16.709 --> 19:18.577
[Pats]

19:18.645 --> 19:19.878
[Clears throat]

19:19.946 --> 19:23.815
Library closes at 8:00,
just so everybody knows.

19:23.883 --> 19:25.350
<i>And the rest of us were glad</i>

19:25.418 --> 19:28.220
<i>we made it through the
weirdest Halloween yet.</i>

19:28.288 --> 19:31.290
<i>And the best part...
Leftovers for breakfast.</i>

19:31.357 --> 19:35.127
Okay, I know my $50 sliver
doesn't seem like much,

19:35.194 --> 19:38.397
but if I get 800 more slivers,

19:38.464 --> 19:40.532
that is one year of college.

19:40.600 --> 19:45.170
And then, three more years,
that's only 2,400 slivers.

19:45.238 --> 19:46.872
[Giggles] I don't know about you guys,

19:46.940 --> 19:48.540
but to me, that seems pretty doable.

19:48.608 --> 19:51.643
[Door opens, closes]

19:51.711 --> 19:53.478
Hey, Axl. What are you doing here?

19:53.546 --> 19:55.280
Nothing... just wanted some breakfast

19:55.348 --> 19:57.115
and to see what you losers were up to.

19:57.183 --> 19:58.417
Did you get that paper done?

19:58.484 --> 20:00.052
Oh, yeah. Whole two minutes early.

20:00.119 --> 20:01.353
Told you I was on top of it.

20:01.421 --> 20:03.021
[Sighs]

20:03.089 --> 20:07.025
Hey, you know, I've been kind
of thinking about my major.

20:07.100 --> 20:08.317
Mm. About business?

20:08.395 --> 20:09.328
Yeah.

20:09.396 --> 20:11.263
What is...

20:11.331 --> 20:12.264
It?

20:14.434 --> 20:16.068
You don't know what business is?

20:16.136 --> 20:16.969
No.

20:17.037 --> 20:18.871
Well, I know, but, like...

20:18.938 --> 20:21.807
Okay, I graduate in business,

20:21.875 --> 20:24.410
so then, what do I do... exactly?

20:25.077 --> 20:26.411
- Mm.
- Oh, my gosh.

20:26.479 --> 20:28.647
<i>I could see you doing so many things.</i>

20:28.714 --> 20:30.749
I mean, you're so good with people,

20:30.816 --> 20:31.950
you could go into sales...

20:32.018 --> 20:34.119
Maybe be one of those
pharmaceutical salesmen?

20:34.186 --> 20:36.755
I think the most important
thing is to work for a company

20:36.822 --> 20:38.657
that gives out free
pens with the logo on it.

20:38.724 --> 20:40.025
Okay, not helping.

20:40.092 --> 20:42.093
Relax, Axl. You don't have
to figure it out right now.

20:42.161 --> 20:43.316
You're only a sophomore.

20:43.462 --> 20:44.896
Yeah, and when you graduate,

20:44.964 --> 20:47.132
the school has, like,
job-placement counselors

20:47.200 --> 20:48.816
to help you out with those things.

20:48.868 --> 20:50.335
Really?

20:50.403 --> 20:51.703
Whew! [Chuckles]

20:51.771 --> 20:53.105
I feel so much better now.

20:53.172 --> 20:55.613
Suck it, future! I'll be
worried about you later.

20:55.708 --> 20:56.808
Sue, hit me.

20:56.876 --> 20:58.454
<i>Frankie: Yep, when
you're just starting out,</i>

20:58.501 --> 21:00.594
<i>the world can seem like a scary place.</i>

21:01.352 --> 21:03.274
<i>But sometimes just knowing your family</i>

21:03.299 --> 21:04.544
<i>is there to come home to</i>

21:04.576 --> 21:06.909
<i>makes you feel a little less alone.</i>

21:07.428 --> 21:09.514
And that's not scary at all.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.357
Okay, Brick, one more time...

21:11.405 --> 21:14.061
what should you do when you
pick up a girl for a date?

21:14.084 --> 21:16.107
Stare in her bedroom
window to see if she's home?

21:16.139 --> 21:18.373
- [Imitates buzzer]
- That is not the right answer.

21:18.405 --> 21:20.201
Walk in and look at her
books until she's ready?

21:20.248 --> 21:21.459
- Nope.
- No, come on.

21:21.484 --> 21:22.252
No. That's better.

21:22.277 --> 21:23.920
Talk to her parents until she's ready?

21:23.949 --> 21:24.949
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

21:24.988 --> 21:26.136
There you go! All right!

21:26.183 --> 21:28.175
Really? That's the right
answer? That was my joke answer.

21:28.207 --> 21:29.207
