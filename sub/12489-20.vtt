OH! HEY, STAN.

00:08.739 --> 00:11.382
YOU CHECKIN' OUT
THE COMET THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO PASS BY TONIGHT?

00:11.382 --> 00:15.246
COMET? NO! I'M LOOKING AT
A FAMILY OF SQUIRRELS
GATHERING NUTS.

00:15.246 --> 00:17.588
THAT'S RIGHT, SQUIRRELS,
FATTEN UP.

00:17.588 --> 00:21.252
GET NICE AND SLOW FOR ME.

00:21.252 --> 00:24.055
WELL, I HAVE
VERY EXCITING NEWS, STAN.

00:24.055 --> 00:26.557
GOOD LUCK TOPPING THE FAMILY
OF MEATY SQUIRRELS.

00:26.557 --> 00:30.761
AS YOU KNOW, MY DREAM
HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO BE
PRESIDENT SOMEDAY.

00:30.761 --> 00:32.733
I WANT IT MORE THAN ANYTHING.

00:32.733 --> 00:37.068
AND NOW I'VE FIGURED OUT
MY FIRST STEP ON THE ROAD
TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:37.068 --> 00:39.640

00:51.252 --> 00:53.484

MY PRESIDENCY BEGINS

00:53.484 --> 00:55.426
ON THE THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY
OF THE COMET

00:55.426 --> 00:58.729
THAT PASSED BY EARTH--
AND STOPPED THE AGING PROCESS--

00:58.729 --> 01:02.062
WHICH IS WHY I LOOK SO YOUNG
FOR A 43-YEAR-OLD.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.765
THAT AND I MOISTURIZE.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.368
AND NOW THAT TALKING DOGS
ARE ACCEPTED,

01:07.368 --> 01:11.071
I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE STAN,
MY SECRETARY OF STATE.

01:18.449 --> 01:21.682
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
SECRETARY OF STEAK.

01:21.682 --> 01:25.356
NO. STATE.
SECRETARY OF STATE.

01:25.356 --> 01:27.388
OH. THEN I'M NOT INTERESTED.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.662
SO HERE'S HOW
I GET TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

01:31.662 --> 01:34.795
MAYOR MADGE GIMMELSTAUB
IS CHOOSING A STUDENT INTERN.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.827
SOMEONE TO MAKE HER COFFEE,
CLEAN HER CAR--

01:36.827 --> 01:38.629
YOU KNOW, LEARN ALL ABOUT
GOVERNMENT.

01:38.629 --> 01:40.531
STEP ONE, I GET
THE INTERNSHIP.

01:40.531 --> 01:43.404
STEP 87,
I BECOME PRESIDENT.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.406
UH, DIDN'T YOU SKIP
A FEW STEPS?

01:45.406 --> 01:47.508
DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO HEAR THEM?
GOOD THINKING.

01:47.508 --> 01:50.481
TALK DOWN TO YOUR AUDIENCE.
YOU'LL MAKE A GREAT PRESIDENT.

01:51.582 --> 01:53.344
Stan: SO AVERY HAS A PLAN

01:53.344 --> 01:55.616
TO BE PRESIDENT IN 87 STEPS.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.388
I WONDER HOW MANY STEPS
IT WOULD TAKE ME

01:57.388 --> 01:58.649
TO REACH MY GOAL...

01:58.649 --> 02:01.121
OF EATING ONE OF
THOSE MEATY SQUIRRELS.

02:23.274 --> 02:25.276
SO, DID YOU GET
THE INTERNSHIP
WITH THE MAYOR YET?

02:25.276 --> 02:27.318
I'M JUST WORKING ON
MY APPLICATION.

02:27.318 --> 02:30.581
WELL, WHEN YOU GET IT,
YOU'VE GOTTA DO SOMETHING
ABOUT PASADENA'S CAT PROBLEM.

02:30.581 --> 02:34.425
WHAT CAT PROBLEM?
THERE ARE CATS
IN PASADENA.

02:34.425 --> 02:37.258
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP
WITH MY PSYCHOLOGY PROJECT.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.260
WHAT PSYCHOLOGY PROJECT?

02:39.260 --> 02:40.731
THE ONE WHERE
I EXPERIMENTED ON YOU

02:40.731 --> 02:43.564

03:03.314 --> 03:05.386
THAT WAS YOU?
DON'T FEEL BAD.

A MINUTE AND A HALF.

03:15.966 --> 03:18.869
GOT AN "A" ON THE PROJECT,
SO I OWE YOU ONE.

03:18.869 --> 03:20.331
YEAH. YOU DO.

03:20.331 --> 03:21.802
I THOUGHT I WAS
LOSING MY MIND!

03:21.802 --> 03:23.634
WANT ME TO HELP YOU
WITH YOUR HOMEWORK?

03:23.634 --> 03:25.706
HA HA HA HA!

03:25.706 --> 03:28.309
A LAUGH LIKE THAT
RELEASES SO MANY ENDORPHINS.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.481
LET'S CALL IT EVEN.

03:30.481 --> 03:32.413
SECONDLY, THIS ISN'T
MY HOMEWORK.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.485
I'M APPLYING FOR
MADGE GIMMELSTAUB'S
INTERNSHIP.

03:34.485 --> 03:37.348
A LOT OF KIDS IN MY GRADE
WANT THAT JOB.

03:37.348 --> 03:40.321
YOU NEED AN ANGLE
TO GET A LEG UP.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.993
BEST ANGLE TO GET A LEG UP:
45 DEGREES.

03:42.993 --> 03:45.996
OTHERWISE YOU PEE
ALL OVER YOURSELF.

03:45.996 --> 03:48.999
LOOK, TYLER, I PLAY FAIR.
I DON'T DO ANGLES.

03:48.999 --> 03:50.831
ALL THE OTHER KIDS
ARE PLAYING ANGLES--

03:50.831 --> 03:53.404
HAVING THEIR PARENTS
DONATE TO THE MAYOR'S
CAMPAIGN.

03:53.404 --> 03:56.767
JENNY WEBSTER'S DAD
IS EVEN GIVING MADGE
FREE DRY CLEANING.

OH, MAN. MADGE DOES NEED
A LOT OF DRY CLEANING.

03:59.810 --> 04:02.643
SHE'S GOT A NUMB BOTTOM LIP
AND A THING FOR GRAPE JUICE.

04:03.814 --> 04:06.777

MY SKILL AND QUALIFICATIONS.

04:06.777 --> 04:08.879
HA HA HA HA!

04:08.879 --> 04:12.453

04:12.453 --> 04:14.455
LOOK, YOU'RE SMART
AND YOU WORK HARD...

04:14.455 --> 04:17.988
BUT IN THE REAL WORD,
YOU GOTTA WORK PEOPLE.
THANKS, TYLER,

04:17.988 --> 04:19.730
BUT I'M GONNA
DO THIS MY WAY.

04:19.730 --> 04:22.262
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU TALK
TO MADGE'S DAUGHTER BRIE?

04:22.262 --> 04:23.894
SHE'S IN CHEERLEADERS
WITH YOU.

04:23.894 --> 04:26.467
ISN'T SHE THE ONE
WHO CATCHES YOU WHEN THEY
THROW YOU UP IN THE AIR?

04:26.467 --> 04:29.370
MORE LIKE DROPS ME
THROUGH HER SWEATY PALMS.

04:29.370 --> 04:33.344
AND NOW SHE'S MAD AT ME
BECAUSE I SENT HER A COUPON
FOR TALCUM POWDER.

04:33.344 --> 04:37.348
I COULD TALK TO HER
FOR YOU. TURN ON THE CHARM.

04:37.348 --> 04:40.651
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
THAT RIDICULOUS EYEBROW SLANT?

04:40.651 --> 04:42.953
YOU MEAN THE "SLYBROW"?

04:42.953 --> 04:45.486
OHH! GET THAT THING
AWAY FROM ME.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.788
I'D RATHER LISTEN
TO THE BEEPING.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.720
HOW DO YOU KNOW BRIE,
ANYWAY?

04:49.720 --> 04:52.323
SHE'S A FUN PARTY GIRL,
I'M A FUN PARTY GUY.

04:52.323 --> 04:54.425
WE HAVE ALL OUR
REMEDIAL CLASSES TOGETHER.

04:54.425 --> 04:57.328
I'LL SEE IF SHE'LL PUT IN
A GOOD WORD FOR YOU
WITH HER MOM.

04:57.328 --> 05:00.300
WELL, I...I GUESS YOU
TALKING TO HER MIGHT HELP.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.333
UNLESS I TALK TO HER
IN SPANISH.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.905
THAT'S ONE OF OUR
REMEDIAL CLASSES.

05:06.677 --> 05:10.681
ARE YOU SURE HAVING TYLER
HELP YOU WITH THIS
IS A SMART MOVE?

05:10.681 --> 05:13.013
HE'S JUST GONNA TALK TO BRIE.
WHAT'S THE HARM?

05:13.013 --> 05:15.586
WORKING THE ANGLES
IS NOT YOU, AVERY.

05:15.586 --> 05:19.319
ONE THING I KNOW AS A DOG IS
YOU GOTTA BE TRUE TO YOURSELF.

05:19.319 --> 05:23.323
COULD I CURL UP ON
YOUR LAP AND PURR?
YES, I COULD.

05:23.323 --> 05:27.798
BUT THEN I'D BE A CAT
AND CEASE TO BE CUTE
OR WORTH ANYTHING!

05:30.731 --> 05:33.464
KNOCKITY-KNOCKITY!
OH, HELLO, KARL.

05:33.464 --> 05:36.437
MRS. JENNINGS,
YOU LOOK RADIANT
AS ALWAYS.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.338
KARL, YOU ALWAYS SAY
THE NICEST THINGS.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.970
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DON'T
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.473
SADLY, THE ABILITY TO FLATTER
NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSEWIVES

05:42.473 --> 05:45.115
TENDS NOT TO IMPRESS
TEENAGE GIRLS.

05:45.115 --> 05:47.848
SO I BROUGHT THE SLEEPING BAG
YOU WANTED TO BORROW.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.120
OH, THANK YOU, KARL.
ACTUALLY,
YOU CAN KEEP IT.

05:50.120 --> 05:53.123
SINCE BECOMING A BODYBUILDER,
MOTHER HAS AMASSED
SO MUCH MUSCLE

06:06.397 --> 06:08.739
LIKE THE BROWNIES,
ONLY MORE PRETENTIOUS.

TO SEE WHO CAN EARN
THE MOST MERIT BADGES,

06:11.642 --> 06:14.905
ONLY THEY DON'T CALL THEM THAT
BECAUSE "EVERYONE HAS MERIT."

06:14.905 --> 06:17.107
OH, THE LOSER'S MOTTO.
YES.

06:17.107 --> 06:21.452
MRS. JENNINGS
SOMETIMES GETS
OVERLY COMPETITIVE.

06:21.452 --> 06:24.485
I'M GOING ALONG TO KEEP
THE MONSTER IN CHECK.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.717
YOU'RE RIGHT, I DO GET
A LITTLE TOO COMPETITIVE.

06:26.717 --> 06:29.420

BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE,
RIGHT?

06:29.420 --> 06:31.121
WINNING ISN'T EVERYTHING.

06:31.121 --> 06:32.893

06:32.893 --> 06:37.668
CHLOE, THIS IS ABOUT
HAVING A FUN OUTDOOR EXPERIENCE
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

06:37.668 --> 06:40.671
BUT IT WON'T BE FUN
UNLESS I CRUSH MY FRIENDS!

06:41.732 --> 06:43.434
MOTHER CRUSHES HER FRIENDS.

06:43.434 --> 06:47.578

BREAKING A RULE.
I CAN'T DO THAT.

MISCOMMUNICATION,

I APOLOGIZE.
I ALSO APOLOGIZE

09:25.235 --> 09:28.568
AND SENDING ALL THE CATS THERE.

09:28.568 --> 09:32.673
BUT AS I LEARNED YEARS AGO
FROM A PARTY THAT I SHOULDN'T
HAVE THROWN,

09:32.673 --> 09:35.005
NOW THAT WE'RE IN,
WE HAVE TO SEE IT THROUGH

09:35.005 --> 09:37.047
SO WE AT LEAST GET
SOMETHING OUT OF IT.

09:37.047 --> 09:39.910

TO TELL YOU THAT TROOPS
ARE AMASSING

09:43.914 --> 09:46.356

YOU'VE BEEN A LOT OF HELP.

09:47.918 --> 09:50.320
YOU'RE OUT OF DIP.
WE DON'T HAVE ANY DIP.

09:50.320 --> 09:54.164
THAT WAS MY NICE WAY OF SAYING
GET SOME DIP.

09:54.164 --> 09:56.997
UH, I'M NOT SURE MY MOM
WOULD WANT YOU RUMMAGING
THROUGH OUR FRIDGE.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.269
MY MOTHER'S THE MAYOR.
I GET TO RUMMAGE ANYWHERE.

10:03.874 --> 10:05.976

MY LITTLE BROTHER ANYWHERE.

10:11.281 --> 10:13.083
BENNETT, THIS IS
THE TENT YOU BOUGHT?

10:13.083 --> 10:15.185
IT LOOKED BIGGER
IN THE PICTURE.

10:15.185 --> 10:18.088
IT'S THE SAME SIZE
AS THE PICTURE!

10:18.088 --> 10:21.952
IT'S NOT EVEN A TENT.
IT'S MORE LIKE A DISCONTENT.

10:21.952 --> 10:24.024
HA HA. GOOD ONE, ELLEN.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.897
I'LL NEVER WIN ANYTHING

10:28.628 --> 10:30.901
REMEMBER, SWEE--
SWEETHEART--

10:32.232 --> 10:34.164
REMEMBER, SWEE-- OW!

10:34.164 --> 10:36.907
SWEETHEART, IT'S--UHH!--

10:36.907 --> 10:39.269
IT IS NOT ABOUT THE WINNING.

10:39.269 --> 10:41.071
RIGHT?
RIGHT.

10:41.071 --> 10:42.172
WHAT'S OUR MOTTO?

10:42.172 --> 10:44.344
"EAT HOT DEATH!"

10:44.344 --> 10:46.416
YEAH, NO,
THAT'S OUR OLD MOTTO.

10:46.416 --> 10:48.919
OUR NEW MOTTO IS
WHAT THE TROOP LEADER SAID:

10:48.919 --> 10:52.883
"THERE ARE NO MUFFIN BOTTOMS;
WE ARE ALL MUFFIN TOPS!"

10:54.985 --> 10:57.357
UH, CHLOE, TONIGHT'S
COMPETITION

10:57.357 --> 11:00.961
IS MAKING A DREAM CATCHER
FROM STUFF YOU FIND IN THE PARK!

11:00.961 --> 11:03.163
YOU BETTER GET GOIN'!
OKAY.

11:03.163 --> 11:07.067
BUT NO BROKEN GLASS, OLD GUM,
OR CARCASSES OF ANY KIND.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.169
WHAT AM I GONNA
MAKE IT OUT OF?!

11:11.271 --> 11:13.173
Bennett: WOW.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.805
THEY'RE BREAKING THE RULES!

11:14.805 --> 11:16.947
HER PARENTS OBVIOUSLY HELPED HER
MAKE THAT DREAM CATCHER!

11:16.947 --> 11:19.950
ELLEN...
MONSTER IN CHECK.

11:19.950 --> 11:21.982
LOOK, RILEY.
CHLOE'S FAMILY IS HERE

11:21.982 --> 11:24.254
AND THEY'RE SLEEPING
IN A TACO SHELL.

11:24.254 --> 11:26.717
HELLO, ELLEN.
(mimicking) HELLO, YVONNE.

11:26.717 --> 11:28.959
IT'S YUH-VONNE.
YOU PRONOUNCE THE "Y."

11:28.959 --> 11:31.061
YUH, I KNOW.

11:31.061 --> 11:33.924
HEY, RILEY. DID YOU MAKE THAT
ALL BY YOURSELF?

11:33.924 --> 11:35.095
CAN YOU PROVE
SHE DIDN'T?

11:37.027 --> 11:38.929
THIS IS ALL I COULD FIND.

11:38.929 --> 11:41.331
MY DREAM CATCHER'S
GONNA BE REAL SMALL.

11:41.331 --> 11:45.005
HOW SWEET. YOU CAN CATCH
YOUR TINY LITTLE DREAMS IN IT.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.437
( other moms laughing )

11:47.437 --> 11:50.080
I KNOW WHAT KIND
OF MUFFIN YOU ARE--

11:50.080 --> 11:51.782
SOURDOUGH.

11:53.784 --> 11:55.916
WHAT, NOTHING?

11:55.916 --> 11:57.948
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

11:57.948 --> 11:59.950
I KNOW YOU MADE THAT,
WHY-VONNE....

11:59.950 --> 12:03.023
JUST LIKE YOU MADE
RILEY'S PIONEER HAT

12:03.023 --> 12:04.925
AND YOU MADE TAMI'S
FRIENDSHIP BRACELET,

12:04.925 --> 12:08.158
AND YOU MADE CAITLYN'S
SUGAR CUBE MODEL OF THE ALAMO.

12:08.158 --> 12:11.001
OH, WE REMEMBER THE ALAMO.

12:11.001 --> 12:15.105
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
RILEY'S GOING TO WIN
THE DREAM CATCHER PRIZE.

12:15.105 --> 12:18.338
BY THE WAY,
A LEPRECHAUN CALLED ME--
HE WANTS HIS TENT BACK.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.140
( laughter )

12:20.140 --> 12:22.913
IT'S TIME, ELLEN.
RELEASE THE MONSTER?

12:22.913 --> 12:24.915
RELEASE THE MONSTER.
THANK YOU.

12:24.915 --> 12:26.746
OH, YOU ARE GOIN' DOWN,

12:26.746 --> 12:29.149
YOU AND THE REST OF
YOUR HALF-BAKED MUFFINS!

12:29.149 --> 12:32.422
THAT'S RIGHT!
I SAID HALF-BAKED!

12:32.422 --> 12:35.255
THE MONSTER GETS RUSTY
WHEN YOU KEEP IT IN A BOX.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.792
ALL RIGHT. IF EVERYONE'S
CHEATING, IT'S ONLY FAIR
THAT WE CHEAT.

12:41.792 --> 12:44.534
I'M GONNA GO GET SOME
PROFESSIONAL GRADE MATERIALS
FOR CHLOE'S DREAM CATCHER.

12:44.534 --> 12:45.966
WHAT'S OUR MOTTO?

12:45.966 --> 12:47.497
Both: EAT HOT DEATH!

12:47.497 --> 12:50.170
I'VE NEVER LOVED YOU MORE.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.542
YEAH, ME TOO. BUT I THINK
IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

12:55.345 --> 12:57.007
BYE, GUYS. GREAT PARTY.

12:57.007 --> 12:59.009
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
BYE.

12:59.009 --> 13:02.312
OH, SO YOU'RE GONNA
TALK TO YOUR MOTHER
ABOUT ME, RIGHT?

13:02.312 --> 13:04.885
YEAH, I GUESS.
A DEAL'S A DEAL.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.887
GREAT.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.559
WOW! YOUR PALMS
HAVE GOTTEN SO DRY!

13:11.061 --> 13:13.063
( car alarm chirps )

13:13.063 --> 13:15.966
WELL, THE HOUSE IS A MESS,
BUT WE DID IT.

13:15.966 --> 13:17.327
WE PULLED OFF THE PARTY.

13:17.327 --> 13:20.931
NOW BRIE WILL TALK TO HER MOM,
AND I WILL GET THAT INTERNSHIP.

13:20.931 --> 13:23.273
YEAH! WE GOT TWO DAYS
TO CLEAN UP THIS MESS.

13:23.273 --> 13:27.077
WHEN MOM AND DAD GET HOME,
THEY'LL THINK YOU WERE
STUDYING ALL WEEKEND.

13:27.077 --> 13:29.940
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND SO WERE YOU.

13:29.940 --> 13:32.342
AVERY, THIS IS A COVER-UP,
NOT A FANTASY.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.415
JUST, I-I FEEL SO GUILTY.

13:35.415 --> 13:38.118
MOM AND DAD HAVE ALWAYS
TAUGHT US TO BE HONEST.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.020
ANYONE ASKS IF I WAS HERE, LIE.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.422
I'M JUST GETTING SOME MATERIALS
FOR AN ILLEGAL DREAM CATCHER.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.056
WAS THERE A PARTY HERE?

13:46.056 --> 13:47.958
BOY, IT CERTAINLY
LOOKS LIKE IT,

13:47.958 --> 13:51.962
FOR SOME REASON
I'M NOT PREPARED
AT PRESENT TO DISCUSS.

13:51.962 --> 13:55.065
I HAVE BEEN CAMPING
WITHOUT ACCESS TO
CLEAN BATHROOMS.

13:55.065 --> 13:58.238
YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU
WANT TO SAY ABOUT THIS.

13:59.239 --> 14:02.042
TEN MINUTES.
I ATE SOME EXPIRED GORP.

14:04.574 --> 14:06.446
THIS IS HORRIBLE!
WE GOT CAUGHT!

14:06.446 --> 14:08.318
WHY DID I LET YOU
HAVE THIS PARTY?

14:08.318 --> 14:10.020
I CAN GET US OUT OF THIS
IF I LIE TO MOM.

14:10.020 --> 14:11.882
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU
TO LIE TO MOM.

14:11.882 --> 14:14.584
ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME NOT TO--

14:14.584 --> 14:17.027
JUST LIE TO MOM.

14:17.027 --> 14:18.989
WE DID HAVE A PARTY,

14:18.989 --> 14:20.991
BUT FOR A VERY GOOD REASON.

14:20.991 --> 14:22.632
THE PARTY WAS FOR KARL.

14:22.632 --> 14:25.465
HE WAS SAD AND LONELY
BECAUSE IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY

14:25.465 --> 14:27.037
AND HE HAS NO FRIENDS.

14:27.037 --> 14:28.969
EVEN HIS MOTHER
WASN'T AROUND.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.372
IS THIS TRUE, AVERY?
OF COURSE IT'S TRUE.

14:32.372 --> 14:37.007
SHE WAS SELF-REPAIRING
AN ATHLETICALLY INDUCED HERNIA.
WHO'D MAKE THAT UP?

14:37.007 --> 14:39.910
Stan: SOMEONE WHO WATCHED
SPORTS BLOOPERS WITH ME
LAST NIGHT.

14:39.910 --> 14:44.484
THAT "BOING" SOUND
REALLY TURNED TRAGEDY
INTO COMEDY.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.987
WE WERE JUST DOING
SOMETHING NICE FOR KARL.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.359
POOR KARL,
WHO ADORES YOU.

14:49.359 --> 14:52.092
HE DOES. HE DOES ADORE ME.

14:52.092 --> 14:55.565
WELL, YOU BROKE A RULE,
BUT YOU DID IT FOR
A VERY NICE REASON.

14:55.565 --> 14:58.168
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER.
JUST CLEAN UP THIS MESS.

14:58.168 --> 14:59.499
OF COURSE, MOM.
WE WILL.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.031
AND I'LL WISH KARL
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY

15:01.031 --> 15:02.602
AND ASK HIM ABOUT THE PARTY
IN THE MORNING.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.334
HE'S BRINGING US SCONES
IN THE PARK.

15:04.334 --> 15:05.976
NOW I JUST NEED SOMETHING
A LITTLE GIRL COULD

15:05.976 --> 15:08.208
REALISTICALLY FIND IN THE PARK
TO MAKE A DREAM CATCHER.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.211
DON'T WE HAVE AN OLD WAGON WHEEL
AND SOME PHEASANT FEATHERS
SOMEWHERE?

15:14.014 --> 15:15.215
THIS IS TERRIBLE!

15:15.215 --> 15:18.248
MOM'S GONNA TALK TO KARL
AND THE TRUTH IS GONNA COME OUT!

15:18.248 --> 15:22.652
YA KNOW, DOG'S AREN'T USUALLY
BIG ON SAYING "I TOLD YOU SO,"

15:22.652 --> 15:25.225
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY CAN'T TALK. I CAN.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.098
I TOLD YOU SO!

15:34.134 --> 15:36.236
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

15:36.236 --> 15:39.109
YOU TWO HAD A BIG PARTY HERE,
TO WHICH I WASN'T INVITED,

15:39.109 --> 15:40.540
AND YOU WANT ME TO
LIE TO YOUR MOTHER

15:40.540 --> 15:43.443
AND SAY THE PARTY WAS FOR ME
BECAUSE I'M SAD AND LONELY

15:43.443 --> 15:46.416
AND MOTHER WAS SELF-REPAIRING
AN ATHLETICALLY INDUCED HERNIA?!

15:46.416 --> 15:48.448
YES.
YES.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.680
THAT HAPPENS, YOU KNOW.

15:50.680 --> 15:53.053
I'LL DO IT ON ONE CONDITION.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.625
I WANT YOU TO
THROW ME A SURPRISE
BIRTHDAY PARTY TONIGHT

15:55.625 --> 15:58.558
JUST LIKE THE ONE
YOU HAD LAST NIGHT,
WITH ALL THE SAME GUESTS.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.230
WASN'T YOUR BIRTHDAY
LAST MONTH?
YES,

16:00.230 --> 16:02.532
BUT THIS PARTY WILL BE
WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.436
NOW, I'D BETTER GET
THESE SCONES TO THE PARK

16:06.436 --> 16:08.538
BEFORE THE VANILLA BEANS
FATIGUE.

16:11.241 --> 16:13.043
TYLER, THIS IS OUT OF CONTROL.

16:13.043 --> 16:15.545
ANOTHER PARTY? I KNEW
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER

16:15.545 --> 16:17.447
STARTED PLAYING ANGLES
FOR THIS INTERNSHIP

16:17.447 --> 16:19.479
JUST BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE
WAS DOING IT.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.252
OH, YEAH? I HEARD
TOBY STEIN'S MOM
JUST HAS A BABY

16:22.252 --> 16:24.684
AND NAMED IT
MADGE GIMMELSTAUB STEIN.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.517
IS IT TOO LATE
TO RENAME CHLOE?

16:27.517 --> 16:29.289
WHAT HAVE I BECOME?!

16:29.289 --> 16:30.590
IT'S OKAY. WE CAN DO THIS.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.492
MOM AND DAD DON'T GET BACK
TILL TOMORROW MORNING.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.225
WE JUST NEED BRIE TO GET
ALL THOSE PEOPLE BACK TONIGHT

16:35.225 --> 16:36.596
SO KARL WILL COVER FOR US.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.128
DO YOU WANT ME
TO TALK TO HER?

16:38.128 --> 16:39.999
I DON'T WANT YOU NOT
TO TALK TO HER.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.472
OHH! WHAT AM I DOING?!

16:42.472 --> 16:44.304
OKAY, JUST THIS ONE LAST THING,

16:44.304 --> 16:46.176
AND THEN WE'LL BE
FREE AND CLEAR.

16:46.176 --> 16:49.008
DON'T GIVE ME THAT
JUDGMENTAL LOOK, STAN.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.311
WOULD YOU PREFER
A "SLYBROW?"

16:58.518 --> 17:00.350
♪ I WON! I WON! ♪

17:00.350 --> 17:01.651
♪ I WON! I WON! ♪

17:01.651 --> 17:03.093
CHLOE, SWEETIE,

17:03.093 --> 17:04.454
WHO HELPED YOU WITH
YOUR DREAM CATCHER?

17:04.454 --> 17:06.456
YOU AND DADDY.
RIGHT, SO THAT MEANS...

17:06.456 --> 17:08.398
Both: ♪ WE WON! WE WON! ♪

17:08.398 --> 17:10.029
♪ WE WON! WE WON! ♪

17:10.029 --> 17:12.362
AH-AH-AH. NO VICTORY
IS COMPLETE

17:12.362 --> 17:13.503
UNLESS YOU CAN
RECORD IT

17:13.503 --> 17:15.505
AND SEND IT TO
ALL THE LOSERS!

17:15.505 --> 17:18.708
EAT HOT DEATH!

17:18.708 --> 17:21.271
( Bennett chuckling )

17:21.271 --> 17:24.544
OH, TOUGH BREAK, YAY-VONNE.

17:24.544 --> 17:28.047
I GUESS YOUR DREAM CATCHER
WASN'T BIG ENOUGH

17:28.047 --> 17:29.679
TO CATCH YOUR DREAM OF WINNING.

17:29.679 --> 17:32.522
THE RULES SAY YOU CAN ONLY
WORK WITH THINGS YOU FIND
IN THE PARK.

17:32.522 --> 17:35.325
(mimicking) THE RULES SAY
YOU CAN ONLY WORK WITH THINGS
YOU FIND IN THE PARK.

17:35.325 --> 17:38.758
THERE ARE WAGON WHEELS
ALL OVER THIS PARK.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.790
LOOK HARDER.

17:40.790 --> 17:43.163
EVERYONE KNOWS YOU CHEATED.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.534
YEAH!
YEAH!
YEAH!
YEAH!

17:44.534 --> 17:46.736
WE DID THE SAME THING
YOU ALL DID!

17:46.736 --> 17:50.100
DON'T BE MAD JUST 'CAUSE
YOU MUFFINS GOT BURNED.

17:50.100 --> 17:53.072
HA! GOOD ONE, ELLEN!

17:53.072 --> 17:55.505
BOO!
BOO!
BOO!
BOO!

17:55.505 --> 17:58.508
ELLEN, THESE MUFFINS
ARE GETTING ANGRY.

17:58.508 --> 18:00.510
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE WE DON'T
HAVE TO STAY FOR THE LAST NIGHT.

18:00.510 --> 18:02.512
SO WHAT IF WE MISS
THE MARSHMALLOW ROAST?

18:02.512 --> 18:07.086
OH! OH! GET BEHIND ME!
THEY'RE THROWING MARSHMALLOWS!

18:07.086 --> 18:08.688
OH, WAIT.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.361
THEY'RE THROWING
MARSHMALLOWS.

18:12.662 --> 18:14.824
( music, party chatter)

18:16.596 --> 18:19.469
THANKS FOR GETTING
EVERYONE TOGETHER FOR
ANOTHER PARTY!

18:19.469 --> 18:21.371
THANKS FOR SAVING
MY PARKING SPOT.

18:21.371 --> 18:24.134
IT'S THE LAWN.
IT'S ALWAYS HERE.

18:24.134 --> 18:27.507
YOU GUYS, KARL SAID EIGHT!
HE'LL BE HERE ANY SECOND!

18:27.507 --> 18:29.509
COME ON, HIDE! QUICK!

18:29.509 --> 18:31.611
OH, I THINK I HEAR HIM!

18:31.611 --> 18:33.483
SHH! SHH!

18:36.446 --> 18:37.747
All: SURPRISE!!

18:37.747 --> 18:39.118
FOR ME?

18:40.620 --> 18:42.292
WAIT. I DON'T KNOW
ANY OF THESE PEOPLE

18:42.292 --> 18:43.793
AND IT'S NOWHERE NEAR
MY BIRTHDAY.

18:43.793 --> 18:46.296
THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.

18:46.296 --> 18:48.458
EVERYBODY OUT!

18:48.458 --> 18:51.161
AND WHO IS PARKED
ON THE LAWN?

18:51.161 --> 18:54.464
MY MOM'S THE MAYOR.
I GET TO PARK ANYWHERE.

18:54.464 --> 18:55.635
LET'S GO, NICHOLAS!

19:01.140 --> 19:02.512
CHLOE, GO TO BED.

19:02.512 --> 19:04.474
I DON'T WANT TO MISS
A GOOD GROUNDING.

19:04.474 --> 19:06.776
DO YOU WANT ONE OF YOUR OWN?
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.222
TYLER, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!

19:12.222 --> 19:14.554
I HAVEN'T EVEN LIED YET!

19:14.554 --> 19:18.758
TYLER, YOU TOLD ME LAST NIGHT
THE PARTY WAS FOR KARL,
THEN YOU GO AND DO THIS?!

19:18.758 --> 19:21.591
WAIT. THE PARTY
IS ALL MY FAULT.

19:21.591 --> 19:24.664
I LIED AND I BROKE A RULE,
AND THAT'S NOT ME.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.567
AS SOMEONE HAS
ALWAYS TOLD ME, I...

19:27.567 --> 19:29.569
I HAVE TO BE TRUE TO WHO I AM.

19:29.569 --> 19:32.602
Both:
I'VE ALWAYS TOLD HER THAT.

19:35.745 --> 19:38.648
EVERYONE WAS PLAYING ANGLES
FOR THIS INTERNSHIP,

19:38.648 --> 19:40.210
AND NOT FOLLOWING THE RULES,

19:40.210 --> 19:41.881
AND I THOUGHT THAT
I HAD TO DO IT, TOO.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.514
YOU ARE BOTH GROUNDED.

19:44.514 --> 19:48.618
IT'S NOT OKAY TO BEND THE RULES
JUST BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE--

19:48.618 --> 19:50.220
( sighs )

19:50.220 --> 19:52.592
THE LAST THING
WE'D EVER WANT TO DO

19:52.592 --> 19:54.624
IS TEACH CHLOE THAT LESSON.

19:54.624 --> 19:56.266
UH, I'M AVERY.

19:56.266 --> 19:58.568
YEAH, WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOU ANYMORE.

19:58.568 --> 20:00.530
WHAT DID WE DO?
I DON'T KNOW,

20:00.530 --> 20:02.572
BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE CHLOE
BACK TO THE PARK

20:02.572 --> 20:04.203
TO RETURN THE TROPHY
AND APOLOGIZE.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.676
THIS IS GONNA BE HUMILIATING.
I KNOW.

20:06.676 --> 20:10.380
YOU SEE THAT, KIDS?
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES
EVEN FOR ADULTS.

20:10.380 --> 20:13.413
GOOD LUCK. LET ME KNOW
HOW IT GOES.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.715
A PARTY FOR ME?

20:15.715 --> 20:18.388
WAIT. WHERE IS EVERYONE?

20:18.388 --> 20:20.720
THEY CAUGHT ME, KARL.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.493
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

20:23.493 --> 20:27.257
I ONLY CAME OVER HERE
BECAUSE WE'RE OUT OF ICE
AND MOTHER'S HERNIA IS SWELLING.

20:27.257 --> 20:29.399
IT'S NOT DISTURBING.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.863
Stan: THE THING IS,
YOU CAN BE A GOOD PERSON

20:33.863 --> 20:35.865
EVEN IF THOSE AROUND YOU
AREN'T.

20:35.865 --> 20:37.837
AND EVEN THOUGH
SHE MADE SOME MISTAKES,

20:37.837 --> 20:40.770
I KNOW SOMEDAY AVERY WILL BE
A GREAT PRESIDENT.

20:43.413 --> 20:45.915
MAYBE AFTER HER,
I'LL BE PRESIDENT!

20:52.582 --> 20:54.023
I DIDN'T GET THE INTERNSHIP.

20:54.023 --> 20:56.025
I THOUGHT BRIE
WAS RECOMMENDING YOU.

20:56.025 --> 20:58.558
YEAH, BUT MAYOR GIMMELSTAUB
WAS REALLY WON OVER

20:58.558 --> 21:01.291
BY LITTLE
MADGE GIMMELSTAUB STEIN.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.634
PLUS, WHEN SHE HEARD
ABOUT THE PARTY,

21:04.634 --> 21:07.397
SHE DECIDED THAT I WAS
A BAD INFLUENCE ON
HER DAUGHTER.

21:07.397 --> 21:11.401
IF SHE CARES ABOUT HER DAUGHTER,
SHE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT
THOSE SWEATY PALMS.

21:11.401 --> 21:15.775
I KNOW. I DON'T EVEN THINK
SHE MEANS TO PARK ON THE LAWN.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.408
SO HOW MUCH LONGER
ARE YOU GROUNDED?

21:18.408 --> 21:19.579
I THINK FOREVER.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.811
AND THAT WILL HAVE TO BE
THE LAST QUESTION.

21:21.811 --> 21:23.282
THANK YOU.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.315
JUST WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING, YOUNG LADY?

21:25.315 --> 21:27.617
PENTAGON. THE JOINT CHIEFS
ARE WAITING FOR ME.

21:27.617 --> 21:29.659
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
YOU'RE STILL GROUNDED

21:29.659 --> 21:32.792
BECAUSE OF THAT PARTY
THIRTY YEARS AGO.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.464
FINE.

21:34.464 --> 21:36.926
YOU HAVE FUN WITH YOUR TAXES
THIS YEAR, DAD.

21:39.769 --> 21:41.300
( boing )
