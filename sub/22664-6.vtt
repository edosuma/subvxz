WEBVTT

00:02.996 --> 00:04.414
Previously on Future Man...

00:04.498 --> 00:05.666
That's not a lot of Cameronium.

00:05.749 --> 00:07.167
- What the fuck is Cameronium?
- It's the fuel

00:07.251 --> 00:08.585
the TTD runs off of.

00:08.669 --> 00:10.545
- Biotics are immune to poison.
- So we flush 'em out.

00:10.629 --> 00:12.798
If I can get the recipe
for the Kronish balls,

00:12.881 --> 00:14.299
do you think that we can
make a poison version

00:14.383 --> 00:16.175
- and then just swap it in?
- You have speed, skills,

00:16.260 --> 00:17.344
but more than that,

00:17.427 --> 00:18.804
it's like you have something to say.

00:18.887 --> 00:20.806
- I've always been a soldier.
- Life made you a soldier.

00:20.889 --> 00:22.140
You were born to be a chef.

00:22.224 --> 00:24.142
If something is important to Joshie,

00:24.226 --> 00:26.895
it's important to me, he is family.

00:26.979 --> 00:28.939
"Jeri Elizabeth Lange.

00:29.022 --> 00:31.650
Medical conditions: none."

00:31.733 --> 00:33.610
Couple seconds after
eating a sewer mushroom,

00:33.694 --> 00:34.695
you puke, shit yourself,

00:34.778 --> 00:36.947
and pass out with no
memory of what happened.

00:37.030 --> 00:38.865
She's going to detonate!

00:38.949 --> 00:40.284
I really thought she liked me.

00:40.367 --> 00:41.743
How long until her head blows?

00:41.827 --> 00:43.120
28 minutes.

00:46.039 --> 00:47.499
Hold on to your dicks back there!

00:47.582 --> 00:50.544
We are two minutes from base, repeat,

00:50.627 --> 00:52.212
two minutes from base.

00:52.296 --> 00:54.339
- Fuck yeah!
- Oh, this is just like

00:54.423 --> 00:56.758
our escape from the
slave mines of Ganderloo.

00:56.842 --> 00:58.468
Minus all the hollandaise.

01:00.512 --> 01:02.889
Check that; garlic aioli.

01:02.973 --> 01:04.933
Why are you guys having so much fun?

01:05.016 --> 01:06.017
That was insane.

01:06.059 --> 01:08.020
There was so much puke and poo and...

01:08.103 --> 01:09.563
Buck up, soldier.

01:09.646 --> 01:11.773
We got three Bio slags

01:11.857 --> 01:13.483
and an Aztec to interrogate.

01:13.567 --> 01:15.319
This is a rush job, Gamma Protocol.

01:15.402 --> 01:16.987
Oh, you better believe it's Gamma.

01:17.070 --> 01:19.823
Her little head's going to blow in...

01:19.906 --> 01:21.491
26 minutes.

01:21.575 --> 01:22.659
26 minutes?

01:22.743 --> 01:23.827
That was not the plan.

01:23.910 --> 01:25.746
Well, this is basically the plan

01:25.829 --> 01:27.623
with a little urgency thrown in.

01:27.706 --> 01:28.999
Guys, are we even 100 percent sure

01:29.082 --> 01:31.627
- she's a Biotic?
- Fuck you, Resistance scum!

01:31.710 --> 01:32.836
Jesus!

01:32.919 --> 01:34.004
Easy, macho man.

01:34.087 --> 01:35.380
She's my...

01:35.464 --> 01:37.007
- ...co-worker.
- Not anymore.

01:37.090 --> 01:38.342
We need to find out where RoboSnatch

01:38.425 --> 01:39.593
is keeping her time machine,

01:39.676 --> 01:42.471
and getting it out of her
is not going to be pretty.

01:42.554 --> 01:44.097
I got so many torture devices

01:44.181 --> 01:45.515
set up in the sewer.

01:45.599 --> 01:47.309
There is literally no scenario

01:47.392 --> 01:48.518
which I can't torture for.

01:48.602 --> 01:50.020
I really prepped the
fuck out of this one.

01:50.103 --> 01:51.438
Although Cunto there,
she's going to need

01:51.521 --> 01:52.731
to be alert in order for this to work.

01:52.814 --> 01:55.233
Waking her up's going
to be part of the fun!

Easy, easy, easy.

02:26.598 --> 02:29.351
Okay, okay, okay.

02:29.434 --> 02:31.520
You kids home already?

02:33.814 --> 02:35.065
- The shoe, the shoe!
- I want to hear

02:35.148 --> 02:37.275
all about your night.

02:39.528 --> 02:41.405
You brought a friend too?

02:41.488 --> 02:44.282
Uh, yeah, it's just a co-worker who had

02:44.366 --> 02:45.701
a little too much to drink tonight, so.

02:45.784 --> 02:47.786
Hey, nobody ever died from
having a good time, right?

02:47.869 --> 02:49.579
Uh, people die all the time from that,

02:49.663 --> 02:51.581
but that's fine.

02:51.665 --> 02:53.250
Well, would you look at that?

02:56.586 --> 02:58.922
One taste of your balls
and they give you a job

02:59.005 --> 03:00.424
and the company car.

03:00.507 --> 03:02.759
You're going to be running
that place in a week.

03:02.843 --> 03:04.469
Come on in.

03:07.013 --> 03:08.181
Okay.

03:08.265 --> 03:10.142
All right, guys, my dad's
cool and everything,

03:10.225 --> 03:11.601
but if he sees us taking
an unconscious woman

03:11.685 --> 03:13.478
into a subterranean torture chamber,

03:13.562 --> 03:15.856
he will call the cops.

03:15.939 --> 03:17.399
What are you waiting for?

03:17.482 --> 03:20.277
Cupcake, look who I got.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.696
What a nice surprise!

03:22.779 --> 03:24.489
And who's this lovely...

03:24.573 --> 03:26.575
passed out, is she passed out?

03:26.658 --> 03:29.536
Yeah, she's a friend, Jeri, from work.

03:29.619 --> 03:31.079
Not the Jeri from work

03:31.163 --> 03:32.581
- who you used to...
- No, oh no, not that.

03:32.664 --> 03:34.583
So we're going to go
ahead and take her on up...

03:34.666 --> 03:36.168
Wait, wait, wait, introductions.

03:36.251 --> 03:38.336
- Don't have time for that!
- Uh, Corey and Tiger,

03:38.420 --> 03:41.423
this is Josh's Uncle Barry.

03:41.506 --> 03:44.676
- There he is.
- Here I am.

03:44.759 --> 03:46.553
And this is my dear friend Wanda,

03:46.636 --> 03:48.972
who we invited to meet Barry.

03:49.055 --> 03:52.976
Oh, this is the famous
Corey Wolf Hart in the flesh.

03:53.059 --> 03:56.396
These are our neighbors,
Melinda and Julius Seneca.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.647
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

03:57.731 --> 03:59.608
- How you doing, boss?
- Good, great.

03:59.691 --> 04:01.318
- Nice baby.
- Oh, thank you!

04:01.401 --> 04:03.487
Thank you, this is Wallace.

04:03.570 --> 04:04.738
Look at those legs.

04:04.821 --> 04:06.823
Lot of meat on those haunches.

04:06.907 --> 04:08.200
You ever eat those?

04:11.077 --> 04:12.287
Okay.

04:12.370 --> 04:13.830
Let's get her out this window

04:13.914 --> 04:15.540
down to the sewer.

04:15.624 --> 04:16.750
Wait, what?

04:16.833 --> 04:18.000
No, no, we don't have time for that.

04:18.084 --> 04:19.336
What do we have, like, 20 minutes?

04:19.418 --> 04:21.213
More like 24 minutes.

04:21.296 --> 04:22.422
Right.

04:22.506 --> 04:24.758
New plan: torture her here.

04:24.841 --> 04:26.343
Oh, what a waste!

04:26.426 --> 04:29.805
I had electric current, scalpels,

04:29.888 --> 04:32.682
- this awesome scorpion I found.
- Hey.

04:33.934 --> 04:35.268
Torture comes from here.

04:35.352 --> 04:36.353
If she knows she's going to die,

04:36.436 --> 04:38.480
maybe pain isn't the way to go.

04:38.563 --> 04:40.315
- Pain is always the way to go.
- Yeah, on someone

04:40.398 --> 04:41.817
who wants to live.

04:41.900 --> 04:45.362
I'm just saying, maybe we
should try talking to her.

04:45.445 --> 04:46.780
Plus, we got a house full of people,

04:46.863 --> 04:48.573
I don't know how you're
going to muffle her screams.

04:48.657 --> 04:49.699
Well, yeah.

04:49.783 --> 04:50.784
When fingernails start to come off,

04:50.867 --> 04:52.077
I don't know how you keep that quiet.

04:52.102 --> 04:53.094
Joshie?

04:53.119 --> 04:55.413
Jesus Christ.

04:55.497 --> 04:56.623
I just want to see her.

04:56.706 --> 04:58.208
I don't even have to talk to her.

04:58.291 --> 05:00.836
You brought the Jeri home!

05:00.919 --> 05:03.171
You've been talking about her for years!

05:03.255 --> 05:05.173
Mom! Okay, just now now, please.

05:05.257 --> 05:08.134
I'm so glad that your social
life is expanding, honey.

05:08.218 --> 05:09.219
I know.

05:09.302 --> 05:10.929
She's very pretty, Josh.

05:10.954 --> 05:11.947
I know.

05:11.972 --> 05:15.350
Can you... just please...

05:15.433 --> 05:16.726
Oh.

05:16.810 --> 05:18.395
- Come on.
- Okay.

05:18.478 --> 05:20.564
I'll be back!

05:20.647 --> 05:21.898
Guys!

05:23.149 --> 05:24.359
Okay, listen.

05:24.442 --> 05:27.445
My parents are not going
to leave us alone tonight.

05:27.529 --> 05:28.822
Ooh, is that sencha?

05:28.905 --> 05:31.741
Okay, yeah, we need
personnel downstairs.

05:31.825 --> 05:32.951
Cockblocking.

05:33.034 --> 05:35.871
Oh, that's like nowhere
near remotely correct.

05:35.954 --> 05:38.832
Hm. Got to do this nice thing,
Wolf, you're useless.

05:38.915 --> 05:39.958
I want you to go downstairs,

05:40.041 --> 05:41.209
I want you to post up at this feast

05:41.293 --> 05:43.587
honoring the Santa Claus, okay?

05:43.670 --> 05:45.005
Run a civilian blockade.

05:45.030 --> 05:46.064
Social duty?

05:46.089 --> 05:47.215
What am I, Butterfly now?

05:47.299 --> 05:48.425
Hey.

05:48.508 --> 05:50.927
Butterfly could talk
to anyone about anything.

05:51.011 --> 05:52.846
Lit up the goddamned
world with that smile.

05:52.929 --> 05:54.609
Fine, fine, I'll do it,
I'll join the party

05:54.681 --> 05:56.141
with the drinking and the merrymaking,

05:56.224 --> 05:57.726
and I'll pretend to have fun.

05:57.809 --> 05:59.936
But I'm not happy about it!

06:01.062 --> 06:02.731
Hey, Wolf.

06:02.814 --> 06:05.233
Time.

06:05.317 --> 06:07.068
Gamma Protocol, 21 minutes.

06:09.571 --> 06:12.574
Lamar, set timer for 21 minutes.

06:12.657 --> 06:14.784
Done... stay cool, man.

06:14.868 --> 06:16.620
- Okay.
- So... so what's the plan?

06:16.703 --> 06:17.871
I mean, I'm no expert,

06:17.954 --> 06:19.998
but I watched Badger
interrogate a million times.

06:20.081 --> 06:23.251
God dammit, he could
get under people's skin.

06:23.335 --> 06:25.670
Just relentless.

06:25.754 --> 06:27.422
How did he die?

06:27.505 --> 06:28.798
AIDS.

06:28.882 --> 06:30.133
Follow my lead.

06:31.593 --> 06:33.637
So it turns out the testing
tells you so much more

06:33.720 --> 06:35.805
- than just DNA.
- Mm-hm, that's right.

06:35.889 --> 06:37.098
You have to do it.

06:37.182 --> 06:38.808
The kits we brought you
take, like, five minutes.

06:38.892 --> 06:40.852
It's like, spit in a bottle,

06:40.936 --> 06:42.103
mail it away, and boom.

06:42.187 --> 06:43.396
Bob's your uncle.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.898
You find out Bob's your uncle.

06:50.945 --> 06:53.823
- Humor.
- We have an Uncle Bob.

06:53.907 --> 06:57.202
He's, uh... he's sick.

06:58.745 --> 07:00.830
Corey, would you like some port?

07:00.914 --> 07:02.499
It's terminal.

07:02.582 --> 07:04.292
Looks like blood.

07:07.879 --> 07:09.297
Ah.

07:09.381 --> 07:10.840
Tastes like honey.

07:12.425 --> 07:13.593
I like bourbon.

07:13.677 --> 07:15.679
- We know, Barry.
- We know.

07:15.762 --> 07:16.554
Cor!

07:16.638 --> 07:18.139
Could use you here for a sec.

07:18.223 --> 07:19.808
Uh...

07:19.891 --> 07:22.102
Boy howdy.

07:22.185 --> 07:23.425
You guys suck at interrogating.

07:23.478 --> 07:25.522
Tell us where your TTD is, bitchface.

07:25.605 --> 07:27.023
- No.
- Is it in one of your

07:27.107 --> 07:28.358
habitation units?

07:28.441 --> 07:30.902
You mean, one of our apartments
where we live like normal people

07:30.985 --> 07:32.612
and not sewer-dwelling animals?

07:32.696 --> 07:34.864
Hey! I'll do the insulting here.

07:34.948 --> 07:36.157
Well, you suck at that too.

07:36.241 --> 07:38.326
Would you stop doing that?

07:38.410 --> 07:39.703
Really distracting!

07:39.786 --> 07:41.538
Got a lot of valuables in
here I'm trying to protect.

07:41.621 --> 07:43.415
Well, you're going to
need a lot more sheets.

07:43.498 --> 07:44.374
She's right.

07:44.457 --> 07:46.167
My head is going to explode.

07:46.251 --> 07:47.502
And then a kill team is going to descend

07:47.585 --> 07:51.089
upon this house and take
you out once and for all.

07:51.172 --> 07:53.717
Well, I've got 68
deactivated brain bombs

07:53.800 --> 07:55.885
and a gobulator that say otherwise.

07:55.969 --> 07:57.887
And that's just my
travel-size gobulator.

07:57.971 --> 08:01.516
Sooner or later, everyone's
luck runs out, Tiger.

08:01.599 --> 08:03.935
It sure did in the tunnel.

08:04.018 --> 08:06.396
Your team put their lives in your hands.

08:06.479 --> 08:08.106
What was it, 43 of them?

08:09.524 --> 08:12.235
Hey! Come on, we said no rough stuff.

08:12.318 --> 08:15.363
It's all she knows, she's a savage.

08:15.447 --> 08:17.574
I don't know how she recruited
someone as decent as you,

08:17.657 --> 08:19.242
but it's all a lie.

08:19.325 --> 08:20.925
You're the lie, you're a fucking Biotic.

08:20.994 --> 08:22.412
There are no Biotics.

08:22.495 --> 08:24.335
That's just a stupid name
her fanatic overlords

08:24.372 --> 08:26.583
came up with to make us
seem like the bad guys.

08:26.666 --> 08:27.667
You are the bad guys!

08:27.751 --> 08:29.085
You gassed my fucking cave.

08:29.169 --> 08:30.670
The Resistance is a
terrorist organization

08:30.754 --> 08:34.256
that uses any means
necessary to kill us.

08:34.340 --> 08:36.676
- They're fucking ISIS.
- Okay.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.761
- That's bullshit.
- Is it?

08:42.807 --> 08:46.102
- I blew the popovers.
- Cat fucker!

08:46.186 --> 08:48.772
- You can't serve those, man.
- I know.

08:48.855 --> 08:51.191
Got cocky, didn't watch time and temp.

08:51.274 --> 08:52.484
Rookie mistake.

08:52.567 --> 08:54.694
You brought shame to
the Futterman kitchen.

08:54.778 --> 08:57.280
Can you help me?

08:57.363 --> 08:59.157
I can,

08:59.240 --> 09:01.034
and I will, friend.

09:01.117 --> 09:03.369
You're a lifesaver, pal.

09:04.454 --> 09:06.081
What do you really know about Tiger?

09:06.164 --> 09:08.541
About the so-called Resistance?

09:08.625 --> 09:10.835
The game had a very detailed back story.

09:10.919 --> 09:12.420
Yeah, story.

09:12.504 --> 09:14.714
Now let me lay some truth on you.

09:14.798 --> 09:17.175
I was born and raised
in Montclair, New Jersey.

09:17.258 --> 09:18.593
Oh, here we go.

09:18.676 --> 09:20.637
My parents are kind of lax Christians,

09:20.720 --> 09:22.388
my brother is an out and proud gay man

09:22.472 --> 09:24.265
and professional robosurfer.

09:24.349 --> 09:26.309
It's a thing, it's cool.

09:26.392 --> 09:27.811
There's no crime!

09:27.894 --> 09:30.313
Pollution and population
are under control.

09:30.396 --> 09:32.357
Humanity has been perfected.

09:32.440 --> 09:35.360
I mean, I'm like a four.

09:35.443 --> 09:37.904
It's utopia, save for these nut jobs

09:37.987 --> 09:39.405
trying to tear it all down.

09:39.489 --> 09:41.574
Utopia, really?

09:41.658 --> 09:44.285
Forcing humanity to get a cure?

09:44.369 --> 09:46.871
Shoving needles up our butts?

09:46.955 --> 09:47.956
Arm!

09:48.039 --> 09:49.958
The shot just... the
shot goes in your arm.

09:50.041 --> 09:51.668
Turning people into monsters?

09:51.751 --> 09:53.169
Hunting down and killing

09:53.253 --> 09:55.046
anyone who doesn't comply?

09:55.130 --> 09:56.297
We only started hunting you down

09:56.381 --> 09:59.050
after you started
blowing up our hospitals.

09:59.134 --> 10:00.677
- Hospitals?
- She means supercure

10:00.760 --> 10:02.053
injection sites.

10:02.137 --> 10:04.931
No, I mean hospitals.

10:05.014 --> 10:06.474
Doctors, patients,

10:06.558 --> 10:08.685
people get their tonsils out.

10:08.768 --> 10:10.395
Look at me.

10:10.478 --> 10:12.647
Do I look like a monster?

10:12.730 --> 10:13.773
I... I don't know,

10:13.857 --> 10:15.150
I'm getting very confused right now.

10:15.233 --> 10:16.359
Don't listen to her, okay?

10:16.442 --> 10:17.777
She is programmed to deceive.

10:17.861 --> 10:19.112
She'll say anything.

10:19.195 --> 10:20.989
We don't have time for this bullshit.

10:21.072 --> 10:22.073
Hey, it's not her fault.

10:22.157 --> 10:24.367
She's been brainwashed her whole life.

10:24.450 --> 10:25.451
I mean, the gaps in their knowledge

10:25.535 --> 10:27.203
- is pretty astonishing.
- Yeah.

10:27.287 --> 10:28.371
It's 'cause they live in sewers

10:28.454 --> 10:30.039
and they call books burnbricks.

10:30.123 --> 10:31.666
Can't you see she's pulling a Badger?

10:31.749 --> 10:33.543
Turning tables, creating doubt,

10:33.626 --> 10:35.712
being very annoying?

10:35.795 --> 10:37.213
Classic Badger.

10:37.297 --> 10:38.381
An hour ago, he wasn't saying

10:38.464 --> 10:40.383
very nice things about you.

10:40.466 --> 10:41.885
"She's used me.

10:41.968 --> 10:43.636
She's endangered my life.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.263
I don't even think she likes me.

10:45.346 --> 10:47.182
With any luck, she'll be gone soon,

10:47.265 --> 10:49.893
like, really far away forever."

10:49.976 --> 10:50.894
Really?

10:50.977 --> 10:53.730
Yeah, we have perfect memories.

10:53.813 --> 10:55.231
What are you talking about?

10:55.315 --> 10:56.816
You guys don't even know each other.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.318
Is that what he told you?

10:58.401 --> 10:59.694
I mean, I really don't know you.

10:59.777 --> 11:01.070
Really?

11:01.154 --> 11:02.530
Like, when we kissed?

11:02.614 --> 11:03.740
Didn't it feel like we knew each other

11:03.823 --> 11:05.491
just a little bit?

11:05.575 --> 11:06.775
In all fairness, I didn't know

11:06.826 --> 11:08.578
she was a Biotic when I was kissing her.

11:08.661 --> 11:10.288
Uh...

11:10.371 --> 11:11.748
you rat-hole-to-rat-holed her?

11:11.831 --> 11:13.124
She showed interest in me!

11:13.208 --> 11:16.920
Okay, well, I'm gonna puke.

11:17.003 --> 11:19.297
I'm done doing this the nice way.

11:19.380 --> 11:23.009
You're getting a
scorpion up your snatch.

11:23.092 --> 11:24.969
Isn't there, like, a middle step there?

11:25.053 --> 11:26.888
No. Scorp in the snatch.

11:49.869 --> 11:51.371
Lingonberry croque-en-bouche.

11:51.454 --> 11:55.291
Brown butter and lemon sucre en poudre.

11:55.375 --> 11:57.627
- Wow!
- Taught him everything he knows.

11:57.710 --> 11:59.837
- Yeah?
- Oh, gosh!

11:59.921 --> 12:03.424
You come sit by me.

12:04.759 --> 12:06.302
Gosh, that's pretty.

12:06.386 --> 12:07.762
How about some more port?

12:07.845 --> 12:08.888
Sure, sure.

12:08.972 --> 12:10.473
Unless you have meth.

12:10.556 --> 12:12.517
That stuff is incredible.

12:14.894 --> 12:16.062
He's a pistol, this one.

12:16.145 --> 12:18.356
You're just kind of perfect, aren't you?

12:19.816 --> 12:21.859
I have diabetes, so I can't eat sugar.

12:26.114 --> 12:27.573
Doesn't make any sense.

12:27.657 --> 12:28.857
I know, it's a lot to process.

12:28.908 --> 12:31.995
I really thought that you liked me.

12:32.078 --> 12:34.789
Oh... that?

12:34.872 --> 12:36.958
Sorry.

12:37.041 --> 12:38.668
So none of it was real?

12:38.751 --> 12:40.031
Josh, I was sent from the future

12:40.086 --> 12:43.339
to protect the man who
saves humanity from itself.

12:43.423 --> 12:46.175
- I'm a soldier.
- Okay, but when we kissed,

12:46.259 --> 12:47.719
like, you didn't feel anything?

12:47.802 --> 12:49.721
Um, I was trying to figure out

12:49.804 --> 12:51.723
if an attack was imminent.

12:51.806 --> 12:53.224
What, so your eyes were open and shit?

12:53.308 --> 12:55.560
Yeah, my eyes were fucking open, Josh.

12:55.643 --> 12:57.603
Oh my God.

12:57.687 --> 12:58.807
In case you haven't noticed,

12:58.855 --> 13:01.691
there is something much
bigger going on here.

13:01.774 --> 13:03.860
I know, I just...

13:03.943 --> 13:05.069
I really liked you,

13:05.153 --> 13:07.822
and I thought that you liked me too.

13:07.905 --> 13:09.505
You're a good man,
you have a good heart,

13:09.574 --> 13:11.868
I don't blame you for being taken in.

13:11.951 --> 13:13.703
The good news is, you
can still play a role

13:13.786 --> 13:14.996
in saving the world.

13:15.079 --> 13:16.331
What about the file room?

13:16.414 --> 13:17.749
I mean, we were really vibing there.

13:17.832 --> 13:19.667
Josh, I need you to focus.

13:19.751 --> 13:20.960
I'm going to be dead soon.

13:21.044 --> 13:23.838
You need to get Tiger
and Wolf outside alone.

13:23.921 --> 13:27.175
Everyone under this roof is in danger.

13:27.258 --> 13:31.220
Why would you winky-face
my Instagram post

13:31.304 --> 13:32.847
if you didn't even like me?

13:34.098 --> 13:36.809
Seriously, are we still on this?

13:39.729 --> 13:42.523
I'm going to the bathroom now.

13:42.607 --> 13:44.650
So what did the chimp do...

13:47.487 --> 13:48.988
Excuse me.

13:49.072 --> 13:50.323
Wow, that's sad.

13:50.406 --> 13:52.200
It sounds like a sad ending, man.

14:05.338 --> 14:07.799
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪

14:07.882 --> 14:10.551
♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪

14:10.635 --> 14:13.930
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪

14:14.013 --> 14:17.725
Where do you think you're going, Sparky?

14:17.809 --> 14:21.979
Ooh, not on the rat hole... uh, mouth.

14:22.063 --> 14:26.400
Okay, wow, bold.

14:26.484 --> 14:28.653
Well, it's your lucky night, mister,

14:28.736 --> 14:31.614
because you're hot
and I am newly divorced.

14:45.378 --> 14:47.380
Should have been me.

14:51.092 --> 14:53.219
It should have been me!

14:54.762 --> 14:58.141
I got a nice surprise for you, Jeri.

14:58.224 --> 15:00.393
I got a real nice surprise.

15:02.395 --> 15:04.730
You know who that is?

15:04.814 --> 15:06.149
It's Elias Kronish.

15:06.232 --> 15:08.192
And if you don't start
giving me answers,

15:08.276 --> 15:11.571
he's about to go kablooey.

15:11.654 --> 15:12.822
- Tiger!
- You're bluffing.

15:12.905 --> 15:13.905
Your TTD is broken.

15:13.948 --> 15:15.491
Why else would you be
asking so many questions

15:15.575 --> 15:16.742
about ours?

15:16.826 --> 15:18.035
Maybe.

15:18.119 --> 15:19.203
Maybe not.

15:19.287 --> 15:20.496
But when I fuck your entire future

15:20.580 --> 15:22.331
just straight up the ass,

15:22.415 --> 15:24.458
you'll be really proud you held out.

15:24.542 --> 15:26.878
I... I don't like where this is going.

15:26.961 --> 15:28.045
You're telling me

15:28.129 --> 15:30.089
you used your TTD to
jump back to the '40s,

15:30.173 --> 15:31.257
kidnap Kornish as a baby,

15:31.340 --> 15:32.860
then came back here to prove it to me?

15:32.925 --> 15:34.802
- That's crazy.
- Is it?

15:34.886 --> 15:36.179
What do you know about time travel?

15:36.262 --> 15:38.264
Multiverses, alternate realities?

15:38.347 --> 15:39.348
Time loops?

15:39.432 --> 15:40.474
Uh, everything?

15:40.558 --> 15:41.851
That's, like, the first knowledge pill

15:41.934 --> 15:43.603
they put into our womb fluid.

15:43.686 --> 15:47.106
Well then... pod scum,

15:47.190 --> 15:49.192
you know that all this
time travel bullshit

15:49.275 --> 15:50.943
makes no fucking sense.

15:51.027 --> 15:52.361
There's no logic to it.

15:52.445 --> 15:54.155
So it is entirely possible

15:54.238 --> 15:55.531
that that's Elias Kronish,

15:55.615 --> 15:56.866
and you know what will happen

15:56.949 --> 15:58.451
when I pull the trigger.

16:00.953 --> 16:02.663
I wouldn't put it past
you to kill a baby.

16:02.747 --> 16:04.123
Tiger, you're freaking me out!

16:04.207 --> 16:05.708
You should be freaked out.

16:05.791 --> 16:07.585
She doesn't care about babies.

16:07.668 --> 16:09.712
She doesn't have a family of her own.

16:09.795 --> 16:12.757
She's not connected
to anyone or anything.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.718
Give me the whereabouts of your TTD,

16:15.801 --> 16:19.680
or Baby Kronish here is
going to get an echoblast

16:19.764 --> 16:22.433
to his soft, little baby head.

16:29.607 --> 16:31.609
We're not going to be stranded here.

16:31.634 --> 16:32.627
No!

16:32.652 --> 16:33.653
Wait, stop, stop, stop,

16:33.736 --> 16:35.154
it's not even Elias Kronish!

16:35.238 --> 16:36.906
It's the neighbors' baby, Baby Wallace!

16:36.989 --> 16:38.783
He's innocent, he's innocent!

16:44.455 --> 16:47.250
Well, looks like everyone's having fun

16:47.333 --> 16:49.919
but old Uncle Barry.

16:53.673 --> 16:55.841
You guys ever had one
of these blowjob things?

17:00.012 --> 17:01.013
So.

17:01.097 --> 17:02.098
What did I miss?

17:02.181 --> 17:03.224
Oh, I was just telling everyone

17:03.307 --> 17:05.184
what you did to my
penis in the bathroom.

17:05.268 --> 17:06.269
Oh.

17:07.686 --> 17:09.939
You're going to want
to wash those hand towels.

17:14.652 --> 17:16.028
You... you took it too far, Tiger.

17:16.112 --> 17:17.530
Oh, I'm just getting started.

17:17.613 --> 17:19.781
What you did in there
was risky and insane.

17:19.865 --> 17:20.950
What did you think, I was actually going

17:21.032 --> 17:22.451
to kill that thing?

17:22.535 --> 17:24.328
Yeah, definitely.

17:24.412 --> 17:25.538
- Maybe.
- I had to explain to you

17:25.621 --> 17:27.455
what a baby is four days ago.

17:27.540 --> 17:29.875
Okay, clearly you don't understand
the fragility of this thing

17:29.959 --> 17:31.794
or how much he means to his parents.

17:31.877 --> 17:33.421
That used to be my room.

17:33.504 --> 17:36.048
Nothing like that ever
happened when I lived there.

17:36.132 --> 17:38.718
Can you... can you please
just take him downstairs,

17:38.801 --> 17:40.386
and him?

17:40.469 --> 17:41.679
Let me have a go at Jeri.

17:41.762 --> 17:42.847
You're no match for her.

17:42.930 --> 17:45.558
And you are?

17:45.641 --> 17:47.643
Tiger.

17:47.727 --> 17:48.978
We've got six minutes.

17:49.061 --> 17:50.229
Okay, just give me four.

17:50.313 --> 17:52.064
I can do this, trust me.

17:52.148 --> 17:54.567
- Fine.
- Okay.

17:54.650 --> 17:55.651
There we go.

17:55.735 --> 17:58.487
- Be careful.
- I know, I get it.

17:58.571 --> 18:01.449
- Let him have a go at Jeri.
- Barry...

18:01.532 --> 18:03.451
I know, right?

18:06.537 --> 18:09.206
They were going to shoot
your baby in a sheet fort,

18:09.290 --> 18:10.499
and there's a broad out there

18:10.583 --> 18:13.085
with a shoe sticking out of her neck.

18:13.169 --> 18:15.463
New low, Barry, you are cut off.

18:15.546 --> 18:16.881
Okay.

18:16.964 --> 18:18.382
- You'll see.
- Tiger,

18:18.466 --> 18:19.586
I was just telling everybody

18:19.634 --> 18:22.261
about what an unusual
upbringing you had.

18:22.345 --> 18:24.013
I never heard of a war leader.

18:24.096 --> 18:25.431
No, he meant nothing to me.

18:25.514 --> 18:27.600
Well, we just did these DNA tests

18:27.683 --> 18:28.893
and discovered family members

18:28.976 --> 18:30.519
we didn't even know we had.

18:30.603 --> 18:32.897
And I was thinking,
what if you have family members

18:32.980 --> 18:34.273
that you didn't know you had?

18:34.357 --> 18:36.692
Doubt it. They're all dead,
everybody'd dead.

18:36.776 --> 18:38.527
No... no, the ones you
know about are dead,

18:38.611 --> 18:40.196
but what about the ones
you don't know about?

18:40.279 --> 18:41.614
They could be alive!

18:41.697 --> 18:44.408
No, it's better to assume
that they're dead too.

18:44.492 --> 18:46.160
Holidays are tough.

18:46.243 --> 18:48.454
Tiger, there must be
someone out there for you.

18:48.537 --> 18:50.706
I discovered a whole
branch to my family tree

18:50.790 --> 18:53.042
going back hundreds of years.

18:53.125 --> 18:54.585
Wait, hundreds of years?

18:54.669 --> 18:56.379
- Yeah.
- You... you found

18:56.462 --> 19:00.049
lost family members with
this tracking system?

19:00.132 --> 19:02.426
- Oh yeah.
- Might not want to go too far back.

19:05.012 --> 19:06.597
Nah, you'll be all right.

19:08.808 --> 19:11.435
It's over, Josh.

19:11.519 --> 19:13.437
I'm sorry I lied to you,

19:13.521 --> 19:15.940
but the world can still
know how good and kind...

19:17.274 --> 19:19.235
Joshie, is everything okay in there?

19:19.318 --> 19:23.280
Jesus fucking Christ, Mom,
I'm going to kill you!

19:23.364 --> 19:26.575
You... you have got to give
me some space, please, okay?

19:26.659 --> 19:28.786
- I'm not a baby.
- Well, I know.

19:28.869 --> 19:30.121
And I don't need your checkups

19:30.204 --> 19:31.288
and I don't need your sweets.

19:31.372 --> 19:32.373
Well, it's just that you've been up here

19:32.456 --> 19:33.499
the whole time.

19:33.582 --> 19:34.792
I've been up here for 18 minutes

19:34.875 --> 19:35.918
and 30 seconds, tops.

19:36.001 --> 19:37.586
Well, but everybody else is downstairs.

19:37.670 --> 19:40.089
I don't care what
everyone else is doing!

19:40.172 --> 19:42.091
Okay, this is my life.

19:42.174 --> 19:45.761
Just, please, leave me the fuck alone.

19:45.845 --> 19:47.304
Okay.

19:47.388 --> 19:49.098
Oh my God.

19:49.181 --> 19:51.308
You should take it easy on her.

19:51.392 --> 19:52.935
Give me a break, Jeri, okay?

19:53.018 --> 19:54.103
I'm not supposed to tell you this,

19:54.186 --> 19:56.772
but this isn't going
to be your life forever.

19:56.856 --> 19:57.982
You know my future?

19:58.065 --> 19:59.608
Of course I know your future!

19:59.692 --> 20:01.402
At least, what it was supposed to be.

20:01.485 --> 20:04.572
Let me guess, you have detailed files.

20:04.655 --> 20:06.365
You were going to move
out of this house,

20:06.449 --> 20:07.533
get a better job,

20:07.616 --> 20:09.744
- meet a girl.
- That seems pretty general.

20:09.827 --> 20:10.995
Her name is Lena.

20:11.078 --> 20:12.455
She's two years older than you

20:12.538 --> 20:15.791
and sweet and shy but slyly funny.

20:15.875 --> 20:16.959
She's a graphic designer

20:17.042 --> 20:19.044
and she drives a vintage Volvo.

20:19.128 --> 20:20.629
That's too specific.

20:20.713 --> 20:21.839
Look, it doesn't matter.

20:21.922 --> 20:23.674
I'm rewriting my future as I go.

20:23.758 --> 20:25.843
And it's changing you.

20:25.926 --> 20:27.470
They are changing you.

20:27.553 --> 20:29.346
Did you talk to you mother
like that a week ago?

20:29.430 --> 20:30.973
Is that who you're becoming?

20:31.056 --> 20:34.935
Josh, control isn't always
about influencing events.

20:35.019 --> 20:38.481
Control is sometimes
about yielding to what is.

20:38.564 --> 20:40.566
Look, you can still walk away from this.

20:43.402 --> 20:45.488
I just jumped right in with two feet.

20:47.740 --> 20:50.659
Just felt so good to be
a part of something.

20:50.743 --> 20:52.328
You still can be.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.335
All right.

21:01.295 --> 21:04.048
Tell me what you want me to do.

21:04.131 --> 21:06.300
I want out.

21:09.094 --> 21:11.222
You're doing the right thing.

21:12.264 --> 21:13.599
Then why do I feel so shitty?

21:13.682 --> 21:17.102
Being a hero doesn't always feel heroic?

21:17.186 --> 21:19.104
Sounds like the tagline to my life.

21:19.188 --> 21:20.397
"Meet Josh Futterman.

21:20.481 --> 21:21.732
He doesn't get the girl,

21:21.816 --> 21:22.816
he betrays his friends.

21:22.858 --> 21:24.610
Sometimes, it take a loser to win."

21:24.693 --> 21:25.778
If it's any consolation,

21:25.861 --> 21:27.446
I couldn't give Tiger
what she wanted anyway.

21:27.530 --> 21:30.533
We don't even have time machines.

21:30.616 --> 21:31.867
What do you mean?

21:31.951 --> 21:33.494
How do you get here, then?

21:33.577 --> 21:35.037
We jump in.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.580
It's a one-way ticket.

21:36.664 --> 21:38.207
I mean, do you have
any idea how risky it is

21:38.290 --> 21:40.751
to bring future tech into the past?

21:40.835 --> 21:43.671
Yeah, Time Travel 101.

21:46.090 --> 21:48.551
So you mean, without
any more Cameronium,

21:48.634 --> 21:50.052
they're stuck here no matter what.

21:50.135 --> 21:52.096
Considering Cameronium's
not even a thing

21:52.179 --> 21:55.474
for another six years, yeah.

21:55.558 --> 21:56.684
What happens in six years?

21:56.767 --> 22:02.857
♪ In 2023, James Cameron
dove beneath the sea ♪

22:02.940 --> 22:05.401
James Cameron?
Like, the director James Cameron?

22:05.484 --> 22:09.363
Sir James Cameron,
father of modern science.

22:09.446 --> 22:10.865
Shut up!

22:10.948 --> 22:13.617
Cameronium is named after James Cameron?

22:13.701 --> 22:14.702
Mm-hm.

22:14.785 --> 22:16.412
Why, because he has, like, a hard-on

22:16.495 --> 22:17.830
for cool underwater shit?

22:17.913 --> 22:21.417
In 2023, James Cameron
pilots his submersible,

22:21.500 --> 22:24.920
the Deepsea Challenge Extreme XG Ultra,

22:25.004 --> 22:26.463
to the deepest part of the ocean.

22:26.547 --> 22:28.299
He pulls a variety of samples,

22:28.382 --> 22:30.676
including a phosphorescent microorganism

22:30.759 --> 22:32.469
he thinks looks cool.

22:32.553 --> 22:35.431
It sits in his home lab for 10 years

22:35.514 --> 22:37.349
before anyone figures out what it is

22:37.433 --> 22:38.684
and what it can do.

22:38.767 --> 22:40.936
Of course, Cameronium.

22:41.020 --> 22:43.647
So I grabbed Eagle and I said,

22:43.731 --> 22:44.982
"You're going through that acid fire

22:45.065 --> 22:46.859
and retrieving the Yusopov amulet

22:46.942 --> 22:48.861
or none of us are going to
make it back to Storm Base 9

22:48.944 --> 22:50.446
before the Jizzadrean Kill Squad."

22:50.529 --> 22:53.657
Wait, what's the Jizzadrean
Kill Squad again?

22:53.741 --> 22:54.783
The JKS?

22:54.867 --> 22:56.619
Elite tactical unit.

22:56.702 --> 22:59.288
Genetic enhancement, degraded empathy.

22:59.371 --> 23:01.916
More machine than human, really.

23:01.999 --> 23:06.003
They will cut your nuts
clean off with a...

23:11.258 --> 23:12.301
Uncle Barry?

23:12.384 --> 23:13.802
You little shit, stop it!

23:25.856 --> 23:27.524
It was you.

23:27.608 --> 23:29.151
And you.

23:29.234 --> 23:32.154
And Josh was there too!

23:32.237 --> 23:33.614
Yeah!

23:35.616 --> 23:38.702
This is the Futterman house!

23:38.786 --> 23:40.579
We'll take care of ourselves,

23:40.663 --> 23:43.040
oh, we'll protect ourselves.

23:43.123 --> 23:44.208
Oh geez.

23:44.291 --> 23:45.334
You.

23:45.417 --> 23:46.710
You broke into my house

23:46.794 --> 23:47.920
and you terrorized me

23:48.003 --> 23:49.171
when I was a little boy.

23:49.254 --> 23:50.547
We've been over this.

23:50.631 --> 23:53.342
Those were Latino
hoodlums and a small boy!

23:53.425 --> 23:55.219
No...

23:55.302 --> 23:57.513
- ...it was them.
- Barry, for the love of Pete,

23:57.596 --> 23:59.390
these people had
nothing to do with that.

23:59.473 --> 24:01.100
Think about what you're saying!

24:01.183 --> 24:02.226
No!

24:03.435 --> 24:04.645
You're going to pay attention to me.

24:04.728 --> 24:06.689
Why don't you get your
stupid head out of

24:06.772 --> 24:09.191
this time-traveling guy's butthole?

24:09.274 --> 24:11.694
Barry, Corey is a friend.

24:11.777 --> 24:12.861
Oh.

24:12.945 --> 24:15.990
Is he the friend kid
brother you never had?

24:16.073 --> 24:18.534
Well, I'm right here.

24:18.617 --> 24:19.952
I'm your friend brother too,

24:20.035 --> 24:23.497
but you don't treat me
like a friend brother.

24:23.580 --> 24:25.499
You treat me like friend garbage.

24:25.582 --> 24:26.875
Barry, that is not true!

24:26.959 --> 24:29.211
Oh, sad to sorry to say.

24:29.294 --> 24:31.213
This ends in a shootout, right?

24:31.296 --> 24:32.423
Blood feud.

24:32.506 --> 24:33.841
- I was good at it.
- Yeah, I don't know.

24:33.924 --> 24:36.301
You said that Wanda would like me.

24:36.385 --> 24:38.554
I said she might like you, might.

24:38.637 --> 24:42.141
You said she's eager to meet people.

24:42.224 --> 24:43.225
Not that eager.

24:43.308 --> 24:45.728
- I have a gun.
- Oh God.

24:45.811 --> 24:48.397
I got my eye on you two.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.482
Don't point that gun at them.

24:50.566 --> 24:52.026
You're not mad at them.

24:52.109 --> 24:54.278
You're mad at me.

24:57.406 --> 25:00.242
I'm pretty sure I'm mad at them.

25:00.325 --> 25:02.244
I haven't been a very good brother.

25:04.496 --> 25:06.081
You used to lock me in my room

25:06.165 --> 25:08.584
and then tell me the house was on fire.

25:08.667 --> 25:10.252
I can disarm this man
with haste and brutality,

25:10.335 --> 25:11.628
- just say the word.
- No, no.

25:11.712 --> 25:13.422
They need to work this out.

25:15.174 --> 25:17.760
That's not how you treat family.

25:17.843 --> 25:19.553
Family's somebody to look out for,

25:19.636 --> 25:22.473
especially when someone's
having a hard time.

25:22.556 --> 25:26.060
It has not been easy.

25:26.143 --> 25:28.771
I should probably not drink.

25:28.854 --> 25:30.773
We're going to get you help

25:30.856 --> 25:32.357
because we love you.

25:36.070 --> 25:37.750
How about you and I
go back to the bathroom

25:37.821 --> 25:40.574
and take this rat hole for a spin?

25:40.657 --> 25:42.326
I will do anything you say.

25:42.409 --> 25:43.869
Mm-hm.

25:58.717 --> 26:02.221
So you've been stranded here
waiting for shit to go down

26:02.304 --> 26:03.806
for three years?

26:03.889 --> 26:06.600
Stuck being Stu's assistant?

26:06.683 --> 26:08.102
Yeah, pretty crazy, huh?

26:08.185 --> 26:10.229
The things you do for the cause.

26:10.312 --> 26:12.147
What, like pretending to like me?

26:12.231 --> 26:13.232
You know what?

26:13.315 --> 26:15.567
That part actually wasn't that hard.

26:15.651 --> 26:17.111
Well...

26:17.194 --> 26:19.738
I mean, every guy I've
ever been attracted to

26:19.822 --> 26:22.658
has been genetically perfect.

26:22.741 --> 26:26.703
Hyperintelligent, like,
basically flawless.

26:26.787 --> 26:28.705
And then I met you.

26:28.789 --> 26:30.332
Okay.

26:30.415 --> 26:32.167
No, no... and I liked it.

26:32.251 --> 26:35.712
You're just so different.

26:35.796 --> 26:37.673
You're so flawed

26:37.756 --> 26:40.259
but funny, and...

26:40.342 --> 26:41.510
genuine.

26:44.429 --> 26:45.722
I had my butterflies in my stomach

26:45.806 --> 26:47.307
before I kissed you.

26:47.391 --> 26:50.978
I thought those had been
engineered out of me!

26:51.061 --> 26:52.521
And I did it because I wanted to,

26:52.604 --> 26:53.730
not because I had to.

26:53.814 --> 26:55.691
I knew it.

26:55.774 --> 26:57.693
I knew that you liked me.

26:59.278 --> 27:01.864
Yeah.

27:01.947 --> 27:03.282
I probably should have
copped to that earlier,

27:03.365 --> 27:05.826
but I don't know, my
training and everything?

27:05.909 --> 27:07.536
Oh no.

27:07.619 --> 27:09.997
No, no, no.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.833
I'm glad you didn't.

27:12.916 --> 27:15.502
Because to be honest,

27:15.586 --> 27:19.256
it allowed me to play the
sad-sack wounded little bird

27:19.339 --> 27:20.966
who you'd tell everything to.

27:22.801 --> 27:26.847
You were so caught up
in my feelings, Jer,

27:26.930 --> 27:28.807
you kind of let your guard down.

27:28.891 --> 27:32.144
You see, we do have a TTD.

27:32.227 --> 27:35.105
And we're not out of Cameronium.

27:35.188 --> 27:38.901
And you just told me
how, when, and where

27:38.984 --> 27:40.193
to get more.

27:40.277 --> 27:41.987
Oh fuck.

27:42.070 --> 27:45.407
As fucked up as those
people are out there,

27:45.490 --> 27:48.827
they never lied to me
about who they are.

27:48.911 --> 27:50.537
And your whole pod person

27:50.621 --> 27:53.373
perfect society
population control thing?

27:53.457 --> 27:55.208
Well, that shit is just scary.

27:55.292 --> 27:58.545
I'm fighting for their
future, not yours.

27:58.629 --> 28:00.881
So why don't you contemplate that

28:00.964 --> 28:02.257
in the next 30 sec...

28:05.010 --> 28:07.137
All right, we're almost out of time.

28:07.220 --> 28:09.765
We're gonna need, we need...

28:09.848 --> 28:12.017
Oh, look at that.

28:12.100 --> 28:13.936
You get everything we needed?

28:14.019 --> 28:14.937
Yeah.

28:15.020 --> 28:18.357
I got it, everything.

28:18.440 --> 28:19.775
Good.

28:19.858 --> 28:21.485
Well, looks like she won't be playing

28:21.568 --> 28:23.278
any more head games with us.

28:25.030 --> 28:26.114
Too soon.

28:27.199 --> 28:28.492
This is Lamar Price saying

28:28.575 --> 28:31.370
your time is up, Josh Futterman.

28:31.453 --> 28:32.788
The fuck, Tiger.

28:32.871 --> 28:34.665
She exploded early.

28:34.748 --> 28:35.874
