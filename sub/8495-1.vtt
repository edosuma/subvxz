01:03.391 --> 01:05.435
When I look back on my childhood,

01:05.518 --> 01:09.189
I wonder how my brothers and I
managed to survive at all.

01:09.230 --> 01:11.358
It was, of course, a miserable childhood.

01:11.441 --> 01:14.736
The happy childhood
is hardly worth your while.

01:14.778 --> 01:17.364
Worse than the ordinary
miserable childhood...

01:17.447 --> 01:19.407
is the miserable Irish childhood.

01:19.449 --> 01:25.372
And worse yet is the miserable
Irish Catholic childhood.

01:42.180 --> 01:45.141
You beautiful wee thing.

01:45.225 --> 01:47.268
You are. Look at you.

01:47.352 --> 01:49.270
So gorgeous.

01:50.897 --> 01:53.316
What is it?

01:53.400 --> 01:56.569
It's a beautiful wee girl, Mrs. Leibowitz.

01:56.653 --> 02:01.241
After four boys. Can you believe it?
A wee girl.

02:01.324 --> 02:03.326
What name is it, Malachy?

02:03.410 --> 02:05.620
It's Margaret Mary.

02:05.704 --> 02:07.622
Oh, she's so beautiful, Minnie.

02:07.706 --> 02:11.292
Brown hair and blue eyes.

02:11.376 --> 02:14.421
Just like her mom.

02:14.504 --> 02:16.756
Beautiful wee thing.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.259
Aren't you?

02:21.469 --> 02:23.680
Come on, Eugene.

02:23.763 --> 02:27.767
Oliver, come on. Splash.
Eugene, come on. Stop crying.

02:27.851 --> 02:29.436
Good boy.

02:29.519 --> 02:34.816
We're in the bath. Bubbles.
Don't cry, Eugene. Don't cry.

02:34.899 --> 02:38.862
- Hey, Eugene, look at my bum. Ooh.
- Malachy, stop showing your bum.

02:38.945 --> 02:40.864
I'm only trying to make them laugh.

02:40.947 --> 02:44.492
Come on, Oliver. Come on. Stop crying.

03:13.438 --> 03:18.067
Sweet Jesus in heaven, Malachy.

03:23.615 --> 03:26.284
She's awful quiet, Angela.

03:38.796 --> 03:40.798
A wee bit cold.

04:01.986 --> 04:05.406
I'll get Mrs. Leibowitz.

04:05.490 --> 04:07.867
Everyone loved little Margaret.

04:07.909 --> 04:11.955
Dad said there must have been a holiday
in heaven the day this baby was made.

04:12.038 --> 04:13.998
Dad said he would get a job soon...

04:14.082 --> 04:18.670
and buy her dresses of silk
and shoes with silver buckles.

04:18.753 --> 04:21.255
Poor little Margaret.

04:21.339 --> 04:24.509
Just a few days in this world
and she was taken back...

04:24.592 --> 04:27.553
by the same angels who brought her here.

04:30.306 --> 04:33.726
- God, look at these twins.
- Stop crying, Ollie.

04:33.810 --> 04:35.728
Eugene, please.

04:35.812 --> 04:39.232
Frankie, I can't do this.
Where do I put the pin?

04:39.315 --> 04:42.026
Me dad said he was going for cigarettes,

04:42.110 --> 04:45.154
and the twins just screamed and screamed.

04:45.238 --> 04:48.866
Thank God for Mrs. Leibowitz
who lived upstairs.

04:53.913 --> 04:58.001
Boys, oh, my. What happened to you, huh?

04:58.084 --> 05:00.628
Where's your mother? What do you want?

05:00.712 --> 05:03.339
We've got no dinner.

05:06.259 --> 05:09.470
Now eat just a little bit more.

05:09.554 --> 05:12.807
Come on, Angela. You have to eat.

05:12.890 --> 05:15.518
Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

05:18.896 --> 05:20.773
Come on. Come on.

05:28.990 --> 05:30.742
Mommy.

05:30.825 --> 05:32.952
Oh, my God.

05:33.035 --> 05:35.955
The children are naked, Delia.

05:36.038 --> 05:37.957
Where did Angela get such filthy habits?

05:38.040 --> 05:40.835
Her mother was always spotless.

05:42.086 --> 05:45.715
Yech! The stink is awful!

05:45.798 --> 05:48.426
It's the twins. Their arses are shitty.

05:48.509 --> 05:51.471
It's a mouth like a sewer
you have. No wonder.

05:51.512 --> 05:53.473
With a father from the North of Ireland...

05:53.514 --> 05:54.807
with his funny manner
and his Protestant ways.

05:54.891 --> 05:57.977
You could go to hell saying a thing
like that. Where is your father?

05:58.060 --> 05:59.979
He went for cigarettes.

06:00.021 --> 06:03.816
- Two days ago.
- I'll break his face, I swear.

06:03.858 --> 06:07.945
Dad will be home soon.

06:08.029 --> 06:10.114
Come on, Oliver. Come on, Eugene.

06:10.198 --> 06:13.701
Get paper and a pen, Delia.
We have a letter to write.

06:27.715 --> 06:29.675
My aunts wrote to my mam's mother...

06:29.759 --> 06:31.886
to send money for the tickets.

06:31.969 --> 06:34.263
We must have been the only
Irish family in history...

06:34.347 --> 06:38.601
to be saying good-bye to
the Statue of Liberty instead of hello.

06:40.186 --> 06:43.981
We were going back to Ireland
where there was no work...

06:44.023 --> 06:47.109
and people were dying
of the starvation and the damp.

06:47.193 --> 06:51.197
It made no sense to me,
but what did I know.

06:51.280 --> 06:55.284
I was only five going on six.

07:33.656 --> 07:35.700
Christ, look at that coat.

07:35.741 --> 07:37.702
Get you buttoned up.

07:37.743 --> 07:39.704
There we are now.

07:39.745 --> 07:41.706
I'll take him to the lavatories,

07:41.747 --> 07:43.708
then I'm off to see
the I.R.A. man for me money.

07:43.749 --> 07:45.918
Francis, you can come with me
for the company, eh?

07:46.002 --> 07:48.045
I'll be needing him to help me here.

07:48.129 --> 07:50.840
Won't I be needing him
to help me carry all the money?

07:50.923 --> 07:54.468
All right, Frankie, you can
go with your pop. Malachy!

07:54.552 --> 07:57.471
Malachy, don't go to the lavatory there.

07:57.555 --> 07:59.473
- I can't stop.
- Peeing all over me.

07:59.557 --> 08:01.434
It's coming out.

08:01.475 --> 08:04.103
Da, Da, wait for me. I wanna go.

08:07.064 --> 08:09.066
No record?

08:09.150 --> 08:11.902
But I did my bit for Ireland.

08:11.986 --> 08:14.196
I fought with the Flying Columns
during the Troubles.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.198
Had a price on my head.

08:16.282 --> 08:18.868
Had to be smuggled to America.

08:18.951 --> 08:23.080
There's no record
of your service here. None.

08:23.164 --> 08:25.499
But I have a wife and four children.

08:25.583 --> 08:28.961
I'm raising my sons to love Ireland.

08:29.003 --> 08:32.506
Look. Please.

08:34.299 --> 08:36.635
We have nothing.

08:36.677 --> 08:39.013
I'm sorry. We can't
be handing out money...

08:39.096 --> 08:41.307
to every man who wanders in here...

08:41.390 --> 08:44.810
saying he did his bit for Ireland.

08:44.852 --> 08:46.937
I'll look into your claim.

08:46.979 --> 08:49.315
I'll let you know what turns up.

08:49.356 --> 08:52.693
Here's money for the bus
back into the city.

08:52.777 --> 08:56.989
You couldn't add to that
to make the price of a pint, could you?

08:57.072 --> 08:59.283
It's the drink you're after, is it?

08:59.366 --> 09:02.077
One pint is hardly a drink.

09:02.161 --> 09:06.165
You'd make that child walk back
into Dublin because you're after a pint?

09:06.248 --> 09:09.168
Remember this, Francis,
this is the new Ireland.

09:09.251 --> 09:12.338
Wee men in wee chairs
with wee bits of paper.

09:12.421 --> 09:15.341
I think you should leave.
Declan, the door.

09:15.424 --> 09:17.343
And don't bother coming back.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.345
This is the Ireland men died for, is it?

09:19.428 --> 09:22.348
Come on, Frankie. Free, my arse.

09:22.389 --> 09:26.519
We're not handing out money
to support the Guinness family.

09:28.938 --> 09:32.733
He wanted to marry her off
to the King of Sicily.

09:32.816 --> 09:36.737
But the beautiful young Wilgefortis,

09:36.820 --> 09:40.074
she didn't want to be marrying
no scabby old man, did she?

09:40.157 --> 09:42.076
So, she prayed to God for help.

09:42.159 --> 09:44.078
And do you know what he did, Frankie?

09:44.161 --> 09:46.080
No, what did he do?

09:46.163 --> 09:48.082
He grew a moustache
and a beard on her face.

09:48.165 --> 09:50.125
- He didn't.
- He did.

10:04.265 --> 10:07.017
Malachy, move away from that window.

10:07.101 --> 10:09.979
Frank, take Eugene,
and don't forget your bag.

10:10.062 --> 10:14.358
Put your coat on.
Malachy, put your coat on now.

10:14.441 --> 10:17.069
I'm telling you I'll kick you so hard.

10:19.488 --> 10:24.410
Here. There you go.

10:24.451 --> 10:27.579
Oliver's been sick on my jumper.

10:29.456 --> 10:31.250
Hello, Mam.

10:35.713 --> 10:37.631
Oh, come on.

10:39.967 --> 10:41.885
This is Malachy.

10:41.969 --> 10:44.930
Mrs. Sheehan, pleased to meet you.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.475
And Aggie.

10:48.517 --> 10:50.561
Hi, Aggie. How are you?

10:54.023 --> 10:55.899
And Pat.

10:58.027 --> 10:59.903
Hi, Pat.

11:06.618 --> 11:09.204
What are you staring at?

11:09.288 --> 11:11.832
Nothing.

11:14.334 --> 11:17.588
Grandma said
she had no room for us in her house,

11:17.671 --> 11:20.132
so she gave us 10 shillings
for two weeks' rent...

11:20.174 --> 11:22.176
in an upstairs room in Windmill Street,

11:22.217 --> 11:24.386
near my mam's sister Aggie.

11:29.183 --> 11:32.895
- Mind yourself, Mrs. Sheehan.
- Look at that.

11:32.978 --> 11:35.647
- I'll take the weight.
- Why is the heart on fire?

11:35.689 --> 11:37.983
It's the sacred heart of Jesus.

11:38.025 --> 11:41.153
Don't these children
know anything about their religion?

11:41.195 --> 11:43.739
Ah, mom, it's different in America.

11:43.822 --> 11:47.326
The Sacred Heart is everywhere.
Even in America.

11:47.367 --> 11:51.288
There's no excuse
for that kind of ignorance.

11:51.371 --> 11:53.415
Look. That's the Baby Jesus.

11:53.499 --> 11:56.835
And if you ever need anything,
you should pray to him.

11:56.877 --> 11:59.087
Will you tell Jesus that we're hungry?

11:59.171 --> 12:01.131
Shut up!

12:26.782 --> 12:28.575
- Ma!
- Ma!

12:33.789 --> 12:35.999
They're biting me!

12:39.753 --> 12:42.881
- Mom, I'm bleeding!
- Hold your noise now.

12:42.923 --> 12:45.384
Look! Look at Malachy!
His arm's all bloody!

12:45.425 --> 12:47.386
It's the fleas, Angela.
They're everywhere.

12:47.427 --> 12:51.390
- Malachy, out of the bed.
- Jesus, will we get no rest?

12:51.431 --> 12:56.311
- Malachy, come on. Pull.
- Let's take the mattress downstairs.

12:56.395 --> 12:58.897
- Pull, Malachy, pull.
- Come on. Come to me.

12:58.939 --> 13:03.402
- Get the mattress downstairs.
- There's fleas on the floor!

13:03.443 --> 13:06.154
- That's it, on the ground.
- Ouch!

13:06.238 --> 13:08.240
Malachy, we're surely gonna
catch our death out here...

13:08.282 --> 13:10.200
and you'll be getting pneumonia.

13:10.284 --> 13:13.245
Me dad said
that if a man could jump like a flea,

13:13.328 --> 13:15.289
one leap would take him
halfway to the moon.

13:15.330 --> 13:18.875
Once a flea has bit a human being,
the smell of blood is too much for them.

13:18.959 --> 13:21.169
They're ready for the lunatic asylum.

13:21.253 --> 13:23.422
They were brought over by the English,
to keep us up at night...

13:23.463 --> 13:25.799
and drive us out of our wits entirely.

13:25.882 --> 13:28.343
Because the English knew that the fleas,

13:28.427 --> 13:30.429
they multiply faster than the Hindus.

13:30.470 --> 13:32.889
- What's the water for, Dad?
- They do. They do!

13:32.973 --> 13:34.891
I wouldn't put it past the English.

13:34.975 --> 13:37.811
St. Patrick drove the snakes out of
Ireland; the English brought the fleas.

13:37.853 --> 13:40.731
And the damp.

13:40.814 --> 13:42.691
We loved our dad's stories.

13:52.242 --> 13:55.203
Hey, wait a minute. I need some coal.

13:55.287 --> 13:57.789
I've got a docket here
from St. Vincent de Paul.

14:01.251 --> 14:03.211
Mister, please.

14:15.182 --> 14:18.518
Francis. Fra- put that down.

14:18.602 --> 14:20.562
Don't pick coal off the road.

14:20.645 --> 14:22.647
We're not beggars.

14:27.444 --> 14:29.488
It's terrible. Look.

14:29.529 --> 14:31.531
No pride, Frankie.

14:33.825 --> 14:36.495
Come on!

14:41.416 --> 14:43.835
I can't believe you.

14:43.877 --> 14:46.338
This baby's sick,
and he needs a hot drink.

14:46.379 --> 14:51.176
Now, if you're too grand
to pick coal off the road, I'm not.

14:55.597 --> 14:58.141
Frankie. Malachy!

15:15.700 --> 15:18.537
Okay, come on. Let's go.

15:20.497 --> 15:22.415
Oh, shit!

15:26.294 --> 15:28.588
Malachy, come on.

15:44.646 --> 15:46.648
Angela, come on.

15:52.487 --> 15:54.447
It's a rabbit she is, that Angela.

15:54.489 --> 15:57.951
I don't see why we should
be paying for her mistakes.

15:57.993 --> 16:01.246
Five born and one gone and so useless
she can't even scrub a floor.

16:01.288 --> 16:03.665
Go easy with the sugar.
We're not millionaires.

16:03.748 --> 16:05.792
She was always angry, was Aunt Aggie.

16:05.875 --> 16:09.462
Me dad said it was a good thing she
didn't own the stable in Bethlehem...

16:09.546 --> 16:13.758
or the Holy Family would be wandering
the world still crumbling with hunger.

16:13.842 --> 16:16.136
I swear the skinny fella's
the image of his father.

16:16.177 --> 16:19.097
Aye, with the odd look
and the sour puss and all.

16:19.139 --> 16:23.101
I think this fella likes me.
'Tis Al Jolson he thinks I am.

16:23.143 --> 16:25.228
I think we'll keep this little fella.

16:25.312 --> 16:28.398
- No, he's our brother!
- That's Eugene.

16:28.481 --> 16:31.026
- You can't keep him.
- Don't bother.

16:31.109 --> 16:34.779
I wouldn't want anything that was half
Limerick and half North of Ireland.

16:34.821 --> 16:38.950
- You should be so lucky.
- Don't worry. I'll have me own someday.

16:38.992 --> 16:41.328
If I have to crawl to Lourdes
on me two bended knees.

16:41.369 --> 16:44.623
Oh, did you bang your foot?
Show me your foot.

17:10.940 --> 17:14.361
I'll go down to Thompsons
the undertakers...

17:14.402 --> 17:18.906
to see about the coffin and the carriage.

17:18.990 --> 17:22.993
The St. Vincent de Paul Society
will surely pay for that.

17:23.078 --> 17:25.038
God knows.

17:42.097 --> 17:44.057
Oh, son.

18:24.264 --> 18:27.016
Jesus, I said to meself,
I have so much gas in my system,

18:27.100 --> 18:29.102
'tis a great pity to waste it.

18:29.185 --> 18:32.480
So I shove a pipe up my arse,
light a match to it...

18:32.564 --> 18:36.025
and there I have a fine flame
ready to boil water in any billy can.

18:36.109 --> 18:38.319
The English come from trenches...

18:38.403 --> 18:41.030
to pay me any amount of money
to boil their water.

18:41.114 --> 18:43.324
That's no story to be telling
in the presence of a dead child.

18:43.408 --> 18:46.995
'Tis better than sitting with a long face.

18:47.078 --> 18:50.957
I made so much money in the trenches
that I was able to bribe the generals,

18:51.040 --> 18:54.252
who didn't normally
give a fiddler's fart about the Irish,

18:54.335 --> 18:57.422
to let me out of the army,
and off I went to Paris,

18:57.463 --> 18:59.424
where I had a fine time drinking wine...

18:59.465 --> 19:02.635
with the models and artists
and talkin' the lingo.

19:05.805 --> 19:08.725
You think that's funny, do you?
I had a great time over there.

19:49.641 --> 19:53.853
Requiem aeternam dona ei,
Domine, et luxperpetua luceat ei.

19:53.936 --> 19:56.522
Requiescat in pace.

19:56.606 --> 20:00.026
Anima eius, et anime omnium
fidelium defunctorum,

20:00.068 --> 20:04.113
per misericordiam Dei,
requiescant in pacem.

20:04.197 --> 20:08.201
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti.

20:08.284 --> 20:11.120
Amen.

20:32.475 --> 20:36.312
I don't know why we can't keep Oliver.

20:36.396 --> 20:39.357
I don't know why they sent him
away in a box like my sister.

20:43.236 --> 20:45.947
It's not right.

20:46.030 --> 20:49.742
I wish I could say something to someone.

21:03.256 --> 21:06.259
Dad said he was going
to the Labor Exchange to get the dole.

21:06.342 --> 21:10.012
He'd be home by noon, he said,
and he'd have rashers and eggs and tea.

21:16.435 --> 21:19.313
He wasn't home by noon...

21:19.397 --> 21:21.399
- or 1.00...
- On your feet.

21:21.482 --> 21:23.985
Or 2.00...

21:24.068 --> 21:28.948
or anytime before the sun
went down that day in May.

21:35.746 --> 21:38.499
Fight! Fight!

21:38.583 --> 21:41.377
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

21:55.391 --> 21:58.352
Come here. Stop! Quit that now!
Quit! Stop, I said!

21:58.436 --> 22:00.354
Quit now!

22:00.438 --> 22:02.815
You little hooligan.

22:02.899 --> 22:05.610
Is that the kind of behavior
you brought from America? Is it?

22:05.651 --> 22:08.571
Well, you come on with me.

22:08.654 --> 22:10.823
I'll put the fighting out of you, boy.

22:10.907 --> 22:13.618
My little Yankee Doodle Dandy.

22:13.659 --> 22:16.621
The masters at Leamy's
School all have straps and sticks.

22:16.662 --> 22:19.707
They hit you if you don't know
that God made the world,

22:19.790 --> 22:21.834
or if you don't know
the patron saint of Limerick.

22:21.918 --> 22:23.920
They hit you if you can't say
the Hail Maryin Irish...

22:24.003 --> 22:26.130
or if you can't ask
for the lavatory pass in Irish.

22:26.172 --> 22:29.717
They hit you if you laugh,
if you're late, if you talk.

22:29.800 --> 22:32.053
One master will hit you if you
don't know that Eamon De Valera...

22:32.136 --> 22:34.347
was the greatest man that ever lived.

22:34.430 --> 22:36.515
Another will hit you if you don't know
that Michael Collins...

22:36.599 --> 22:38.601
was the greatest man that ever lived.

22:38.684 --> 22:41.437
McCourt.

23:01.165 --> 23:05.836
You're a bad Yank, McCourt. What are you?

23:05.878 --> 23:10.216
They said we were cowboys
and gangsters, sir.

23:10.299 --> 23:12.635
- I was only joking, sir.
- No more jokes.

23:12.718 --> 23:14.804
- It's not their fault they're Yanks.
- T'isn't, sir.

23:14.887 --> 23:17.807
You should go down
on your two knees every night...

23:17.890 --> 23:20.726
and give thanks to God
that you're not a Yank.

23:20.810 --> 23:23.979
If you were, Al Capone himself would be
coming to you for instruction.

23:32.530 --> 23:35.199
I know Oliver is dead.

23:35.282 --> 23:37.618
Malachy knows Oliver is dead,

23:37.701 --> 23:41.622
but little Eugene is only two
and too small to know anything.

23:41.705 --> 23:43.624
Malachy and I make him laugh,

23:43.707 --> 23:45.626
pull faces, put pots on our heads,

23:45.709 --> 23:49.171
take him to the park,
show him the flowers.

23:49.255 --> 23:54.135
Me dad says Eugene is lucky to have
such brothers like me and Malachy.

24:09.275 --> 24:11.193
He died anyway.

24:11.277 --> 24:13.195
Ma.

24:25.332 --> 24:28.836
Please, God,

24:28.919 --> 24:31.672
is this what you want, is it?

24:31.755 --> 24:35.926
I'm not supposed to question this, am I?

24:37.845 --> 24:42.766
You took my son, Oliver.

24:42.808 --> 24:45.477
You took his brother, Eugene.

24:46.979 --> 24:50.274
You took their beautiful
wee sister, Margaret Mary.

24:52.484 --> 24:56.655
Dear God above,

24:56.739 --> 25:00.409
why do you want the wee children to die?

25:15.466 --> 25:19.678
Please, God, don't let Malachy
and me and the rest of us...

25:19.762 --> 25:23.849
be taken off in the box
for the hole in the ground.

25:23.933 --> 25:27.519
Or even Aunt Aggie
or Mr. Benson at Leamy's School.

25:27.603 --> 25:32.232
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Toast.

26:19.780 --> 26:21.782
Be going in a minute, son.

26:21.865 --> 26:24.243
No, that's Eugene's coffin.

26:24.284 --> 26:26.745
I'll tell mam you put your pint
on Eugene's coffin.

26:26.787 --> 26:30.040
- Have another pint, mister.
- Will you wait outside a few minutes?

26:30.124 --> 26:32.251
- No!
- Jesus, if that was my son,

26:32.292 --> 26:35.045
I'd kick his arse
from here to County Kerry.

26:35.129 --> 26:39.299
I mean, if a man can't have a pint
on the day of a funeral,

26:39.383 --> 26:41.343
what use is living at all?

27:19.923 --> 27:24.470
I couldn't have spent
another minute in that room.

27:24.511 --> 27:28.098
I saw me little twins
morning, noon and night.

27:28.182 --> 27:31.101
If we hadn't have moved,
I'd have gone out of my mind...

27:31.185 --> 27:33.687
and ended up in the lunatic asylum.

27:37.524 --> 27:42.404
I'm sorry, but it was
only five months ago.

27:42.488 --> 27:47.201
And before that,
I lost my little girl in New York.

27:47.284 --> 27:50.954
And I've the two boys here
and I've one on the way.

27:51.038 --> 27:53.165
Ah, now, missus, sit down, will you?

27:53.207 --> 27:55.167
Thanks.

27:58.712 --> 28:00.839
That's a nice coat you're wearing.

28:00.881 --> 28:04.885
It was given to me
by my cousin in Brooklyn. It's not new.

28:05.969 --> 28:08.972
McCourt. That's not a Limerick name.

28:09.056 --> 28:11.099
Where'd you get a name like that?

28:11.183 --> 28:13.185
My husband, sir. He's from the North.

28:13.227 --> 28:16.647
Why don't you go to Belfast and see
what they can do for you up there?

28:19.066 --> 28:21.318
I don't know, sir.

28:21.401 --> 28:23.320
Of course you don't know.

28:23.403 --> 28:25.364
There's great ignorance in the world.

28:25.447 --> 28:27.532
I said there's a great deal
of ignorance in the world.

28:31.828 --> 28:34.331
And what do you want from us?

28:34.414 --> 28:37.542
There isn't a stick of furniture
in the new place.

28:37.626 --> 28:42.464
- Does your husband have a job?
- No, sir, he's on the dole.

28:46.259 --> 28:49.554
We'll give you a docket
for a table, two chairs and two beds.

28:49.596 --> 28:52.599
You can take it to the second hand
furniture shop in Irish town.

28:52.641 --> 28:55.686
Excuse me, sir,
but will the beds be second hand?

28:55.769 --> 28:58.105
Of course they will.

28:58.188 --> 29:00.983
I'm worried about sleeping
in beds people might have died in.

29:01.066 --> 29:03.068
Especially if they died
of the consumption.

29:03.110 --> 29:07.155
Beggars can't be choosers, Mrs. McCourt.

29:10.367 --> 29:12.953
Thanks.

30:06.256 --> 30:08.884
I should say it's a good fire.

30:11.052 --> 30:13.138
Could it be true

30:13.221 --> 30:15.515
Hey, hey, that's my wife.

30:15.557 --> 30:17.517
Someone like you

30:17.559 --> 30:20.479
Who's he?

30:20.520 --> 30:25.150
That, Francis, is Pope Leo XIII,

30:25.233 --> 30:28.028
and he was a great friend
of the working man.

30:28.069 --> 30:31.364
You know, I found this in an alley
in Brooklyn in someone's rubbish.

30:31.448 --> 30:34.326
No doubt thrown away by some eejit
that had no time for the working man.

30:34.367 --> 30:36.369
Ugh, what's that stink?

30:36.411 --> 30:40.040
Hey, what are you doing?

30:40.123 --> 30:42.334
Why are you emptying your bucket
in our lavatory?

30:42.375 --> 30:46.171
Your lavatory, mister? Ah, no.
I think you're mistaken there.

30:46.213 --> 30:48.340
This here is the lavatory
for the whole lane, it is.

30:48.423 --> 30:51.760
The buckets of 11 families
get flushed down here every day.

30:51.843 --> 30:54.221
And it gets fairly powerful here
in the warm weather.

30:54.304 --> 30:56.515
So powerful you'll be
calling for a gas mask.

30:56.556 --> 30:58.892
So, good night to you. Missus.

30:58.975 --> 31:01.144
I hope you'll be happy in the house.

31:01.228 --> 31:04.606
Thanks very much.

31:04.773 --> 31:08.735
And there was this big man,
and he came along and he met this woman,

31:08.818 --> 31:11.947
and he grew a big huge beard
all over her face,

31:12.030 --> 31:14.574
and then they got married.

31:33.301 --> 31:35.262
Have we moved again, Frankie?

31:35.303 --> 31:37.764
No, they wouldn't go without the Pope.

31:54.447 --> 31:59.119
Oh, Jesus, look at the state of youse.
Couple of drowning rats.

31:59.202 --> 32:01.079
Get your wet clothes off,
dry yourself by the fire,

32:01.121 --> 32:04.457
and say hello to your brother Michael.

32:06.543 --> 32:08.461
He's fatter than the Baby Jesus.

32:08.545 --> 32:11.965
He's the spitting image of your dead
little sister...

32:12.007 --> 32:15.218
with the lovely blue eyes
and the gorgeous eyebrows.

32:15.301 --> 32:17.220
Why are we all upstairs?

32:17.303 --> 32:21.099
The downstairs is full of the damp.
It's killing us one by one.

32:21.141 --> 32:24.269
That lavatory could kill us
with every class of disease.

32:24.352 --> 32:26.896
It was the Limerick damp
that killed your wee brothers.

32:26.980 --> 32:29.816
We'll be dry up here for now.
We'll go downstairs for the spring.

32:29.899 --> 32:32.569
It's like going away on holiday
to a nice, warm, foreign place,

32:32.652 --> 32:34.571
like- like Italy.

32:34.654 --> 32:36.573
- Italy?
- Aye, we could be in Sorrento.

32:36.656 --> 32:38.616
Calcutta, more like.

32:38.700 --> 32:42.495
- What about the Pope?
- He can stay downstairs in Ireland.

32:42.579 --> 32:46.416
Will you look at the state
of those children's shoes?

32:46.499 --> 32:48.501
I can't go to the St. Vincent's for boots.

32:48.585 --> 32:51.838
I'm too weak to be standing in the queue.

32:51.921 --> 32:55.341
There was a woman who had triplets
waiting forever in that queue.

32:55.383 --> 32:58.511
Have you no pride, Angela,
begging like that?

32:58.595 --> 33:01.347
What would you do, Mr. Grand Manner?

33:01.431 --> 33:03.475
You'd let them go barefoot
before you got off your arse,

33:03.516 --> 33:05.018
useless feck that you are.

33:09.731 --> 33:11.107
Right.

33:11.191 --> 33:13.151
Useless feck, is it?

33:13.193 --> 33:15.153
We'll see.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.718
It's poor I am.

33:42.347 --> 33:44.724
It's unlucky I am.

33:50.480 --> 33:52.524
But it's useless...

33:56.903 --> 33:58.571
I'm not.

34:12.210 --> 34:15.004
Look at those shoes!

34:54.335 --> 34:56.420
- Where are your shoes?
- Don't know, sir.

34:56.504 --> 34:59.173
Of course you know, boy. Where are they?

34:59.257 --> 35:02.051
Did your mommy not put
on your shoes this morning?

35:02.135 --> 35:04.721
Did you come to school
without shoes, did you?

35:04.804 --> 35:08.349
How many times have you been told about
walking the streets in your bare feet?

35:08.433 --> 35:11.728
By God, I'll boot
the bare feet out of you, boy.

35:19.986 --> 35:22.071
Put them on, boy.

35:27.827 --> 35:30.455
Quiet!

35:30.538 --> 35:33.791
Do I hear sneering in this class?

35:33.833 --> 35:37.128
Do I hear jeering at another's misfortune?

35:37.211 --> 35:40.381
Is there any boy in this class
who thinks he's perfect?

35:40.465 --> 35:43.551
If so, raise your hands.

35:43.634 --> 35:47.305
Is there any boy here now who has money
galore to be spending on shoes?

35:47.346 --> 35:49.807
Raise your hands.

35:49.891 --> 35:52.435
No.

35:52.518 --> 35:56.814
There are boys in this class
who have no shoes at all,

35:56.898 --> 36:00.485
and it's not their fault.

36:00.568 --> 36:02.487
It's not their shame.

36:02.570 --> 36:05.239
Our Lord had no shoes.

36:05.323 --> 36:09.619
He died shoeless.

36:09.702 --> 36:14.123
You don't see Him
hanging on the cross sporting shoes.

36:14.207 --> 36:17.418
- Do you, boys?
- No, sir!

36:17.502 --> 36:19.420
What is it you don't see Our Lord doing?

36:19.504 --> 36:23.007
Hanging on the cross sporting shoes.

36:23.090 --> 36:26.010
"Hanging on the cross
sporting shoes," what?

36:26.052 --> 36:30.306
Hanging on the cross sporting shoes, sir.

36:32.225 --> 36:36.103
Everyday, me dad would look for a job,

36:36.187 --> 36:39.023
- somehow, he never seemed to get one.
- We've enough for today.

36:39.065 --> 36:42.652
- Mam said it was his Northern accent.
- No work here. Sorry.

36:42.735 --> 36:47.406
Grandma said it was because
of his funny manner.

37:00.127 --> 37:04.006
Me dad knew those
lanes like the back of his hand.

37:04.090 --> 37:06.884
He walked them often enough
when he couldn't get work...

37:06.926 --> 37:09.762
and was too ashamed
to come home to me mam.

37:14.267 --> 37:16.811
That's why we loved Easter.

37:16.894 --> 37:20.856
Because it was at Easter
that me dad got his first job.

37:25.945 --> 37:28.781
The dipsy doodle is the thing to beware

37:28.864 --> 37:31.617
The dipsy doodle is gonna get in your hair

37:31.701 --> 37:34.412
And if it gets to you it couldn't be worse

37:34.453 --> 37:37.248
The things you say
will all come out in reverse

37:37.331 --> 37:39.750
Don't go up the mine, Manny

37:39.834 --> 37:42.628
That's the way the dipsy doodle works

37:42.712 --> 37:44.839
The dipsy doodle is a way to do fine

37:44.922 --> 37:48.259
It's almost always
at the back of your mind

37:48.342 --> 37:51.512
You never know it's there
until it's too late

37:51.596 --> 37:53.723
And then you get in such a terrible state

37:53.806 --> 37:56.017
Will you stop it?

37:56.100 --> 37:58.561
Maybe if you weren't
strangling me, I'd be fine.

37:58.644 --> 38:02.189
- Stop it.
- When you think you're crazy

38:02.273 --> 38:05.609
It was only
at the Limerick Cement Factory,

38:05.651 --> 38:07.862
but he still wore a collar and tie.

38:07.945 --> 38:11.490
He said a man without a tie
had no respect for himself.

38:22.376 --> 38:24.920
Come on.

38:36.849 --> 38:41.270
In Mount joy jail

38:41.354 --> 38:44.315
One Monday morning

38:44.357 --> 38:49.278
High upon the gallows tree

38:49.361 --> 38:53.616
Kevin Barry gave his young life

38:53.699 --> 38:57.453
For the cause of liberty

38:57.536 --> 38:59.497
For Jesus' sake, put a sockin it!

38:59.580 --> 39:02.041
Some of us have to go
to feckin' work in the morning!

39:02.124 --> 39:07.004
Yet there's no one can deny

39:07.046 --> 39:10.800
As he walked to death that morning

39:10.883 --> 39:14.178
He proudly held his head

39:19.016 --> 39:20.976
His head up high

39:27.316 --> 39:29.819
Francis! Malachy!

39:36.909 --> 39:39.870
Come down here, boys.
I have the Friday penny for you.

39:39.912 --> 39:42.832
No. Be quiet.

39:42.915 --> 39:46.710
Up, boys!

39:46.752 --> 39:50.714
Those Red Branch Knights!

39:50.756 --> 39:53.133
Those Fenian men!

39:53.217 --> 39:56.178
The glorious I.R.A.!

39:56.262 --> 40:00.057
Up! Up! Up!

40:21.328 --> 40:25.082
I have the Friday penny for you, boys.

40:25.165 --> 40:27.209
You line up like soldiers now,

40:27.293 --> 40:30.504
and promise to die for Ireland.

40:30.588 --> 40:34.091
- I don't want it.
- I don't want it either.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.599
Damn!

40:46.979 --> 40:49.023
When we woke up the next morning,

40:49.106 --> 40:51.025
he was still asleep.

40:51.108 --> 40:53.444
He missed work and lost his job.

41:15.507 --> 41:18.135
And what do I have here, Clohessy?

41:18.218 --> 41:20.804
Strips of newspaper, sir.

41:20.971 --> 41:23.557
And what do they represent, Clohessy?

41:23.640 --> 41:25.684
Pieces of the Limerick Leader, sir.

41:25.768 --> 41:28.103
No!

41:28.145 --> 41:31.106
The body and blood of Christ.

41:31.148 --> 41:33.567
If you don't pay more attention,
it'll be the Last Rites...

41:33.650 --> 41:35.861
you'll be getting,
not your Holy Communion.

41:38.405 --> 41:41.241
Irish is the language of patriots...

41:41.325 --> 41:45.162
and English of traitors and informers.

41:45.204 --> 41:48.082
But Latin- ah, boys, Latin-

41:48.165 --> 41:51.168
that the Holy Martyrs
spoke before expiring...

41:51.251 --> 41:54.046
in the foaming mouths of ravenous lions.

41:54.129 --> 41:58.550
Yes, it's Latin that gains
entrance to heaven itself.

41:58.634 --> 42:00.511
But there are boys in this class...

42:00.594 --> 42:04.515
who will never know Sanctifying Grace.

42:04.556 --> 42:07.309
And why? Because of greed.

42:07.351 --> 42:10.687
Those greedy little black guards
are talking even now...

42:10.729 --> 42:14.316
about the money they'll
get from the Collection.

42:14.358 --> 42:19.154
They'll go from house to house
in their little suits like beggars.

42:19.196 --> 42:21.156
And will they take any of that money...

42:21.198 --> 42:26.120
and send it to the poor black babies
in Africa as they should?

42:26.203 --> 42:28.330
Oh, no.

42:28.372 --> 42:33.252
It's off to the cinema
the First Communion boys will go...

42:33.335 --> 42:38.173
to wallow in the disgusting filth...

42:38.215 --> 42:43.178
spewed across the world
by the devil's henchmen...

42:43.220 --> 42:46.056
in Hollywood.

42:46.098 --> 42:49.184
- Isn't that right, McCourt?
- 'Tis, sir.

42:49.226 --> 42:53.105
Don't speak, you! Can't you see
that God is on your tongue?

42:53.188 --> 42:56.358
Where is God, boys?

42:56.400 --> 42:59.236
On his tongue, sir.

42:59.278 --> 43:01.238
On his tongue.

43:04.324 --> 43:06.869
My friend, Mikey Molloy,

43:06.910 --> 43:08.912
tells us all about
how much money we'll make...

43:08.954 --> 43:10.956
at the Collection
after our First Communion,

43:11.039 --> 43:13.000
when we all knock
on the neighbors' doors...

43:13.083 --> 43:16.253
and get as much as five shillings
for sweets and cakes...

43:16.336 --> 43:18.881
and even go to the Lyric Cinema
to see James Cagney.

43:18.964 --> 43:22.301
- I seen it three times.
- What happens in it?

43:22.384 --> 43:26.221
Also, Mikey is the expert
in the lane on girls' bodies...

43:26.263 --> 43:28.473
and dirty things in general.

43:28.557 --> 43:31.351
Now, on top, the girls
have great floppy things called titties.

43:31.435 --> 43:34.897
And at the end of them,
great red things like dogs' noses.

43:34.980 --> 43:38.859
And down at the bottom-
Now that's an entirely different matter.

43:38.942 --> 43:42.779
- They don't have a mickey down there.
- What do they have?

43:42.821 --> 43:45.407
I can tell you, but I don't think
he should hear it.

43:45.449 --> 43:47.409
Malachy, go away.

43:49.828 --> 43:52.873
Eww! Yuck!

44:00.172 --> 44:03.634
Oh, look, I'll take one of these as well.

44:32.329 --> 44:36.208
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

44:36.291 --> 44:39.586
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
This is my first confession.

44:39.670 --> 44:43.423
Yes, my child.
And what sins have you committed?

44:43.507 --> 44:45.675
I told a lie, I hit my brother,

44:45.717 --> 44:48.261
I stole a penny from my mother's purse,

44:48.345 --> 44:50.305
and I ate a sausage on Friday.

44:50.347 --> 44:52.599
Yes, my child, anything else?

44:52.682 --> 44:55.602
I listened to dirty things
about girls from the lanes...

44:55.685 --> 44:58.063
who don't care what they do because they-

44:58.146 --> 45:01.066
because they've already
done it with their brothers.

45:01.149 --> 45:04.820
And who told you these things?

45:04.861 --> 45:07.531
- Mikey Molloy, Father.
- Hmm.

45:07.614 --> 45:11.034
For your penance, say three Hail Marys,
three Our Fathers,

45:11.076 --> 45:13.370
and say a special prayer for me.

45:13.453 --> 45:15.455
Am I one of the worst boys, Father?

45:15.539 --> 45:18.500
No, mychild. You have a long way to go.

45:21.420 --> 45:24.131
Wake up! Wake up!

45:24.214 --> 45:27.676
His First Communion,
the happiest day of his life,

45:27.759 --> 45:29.719
and the lot of you still snoring in there.

45:29.761 --> 45:33.223
Here, you two, get up. Go on.

45:33.265 --> 45:35.934
Look at him.
A bar of soap wouldn't be lost on him.

45:36.017 --> 45:37.978
I'll be red raw.

45:38.061 --> 45:40.397
I swear it's the Northern Ireland in you.

45:40.438 --> 45:42.399
It attracts the dirt.

45:42.440 --> 45:44.651
You've the dirty gob of your father.

45:44.734 --> 45:46.444
Aah! That's cold.

45:46.528 --> 45:48.989
Jesus, you have enough dirt
in your ears...

45:49.072 --> 45:51.741
to grow potatoes.

45:51.783 --> 45:55.954
Will you look at that mop?
It won't lie down.

45:56.037 --> 45:58.874
You didn't get this hair
from our side of the family.

45:58.915 --> 46:01.877
This is North of Ireland hair
you got from your father.

46:01.918 --> 46:05.422
It's like- like what
you'd see on a Presbyterian.

46:08.049 --> 46:10.218
Will you stop spitting on me?

46:10.260 --> 46:12.762
A little spit won't kill you.

46:12.846 --> 46:16.516
If your mother had married a proper,
decent Limerick man,

46:16.600 --> 46:19.769
you wouldn't have stand-up,
North of Ireland, Protestant hair.

46:19.811 --> 46:21.771
And we wouldn't be late.

46:38.830 --> 46:42.250
Corpus Christi.

46:44.794 --> 46:47.422
Corpus Christi.

46:51.760 --> 46:54.095
Corpus Christi.

46:59.517 --> 47:02.312
Will you stop your clucking
and get back to your seat?

47:04.314 --> 47:06.274
Corpus Christi.

47:14.699 --> 47:17.285
Mam, can I go now and make the Collection?

47:17.369 --> 47:20.121
I want to go to the Lyric
to see James Cagney.

47:20.163 --> 47:21.915
You can't make the Collection
until you've had...

47:21.998 --> 47:24.125
a proper First Communion breakfast
at my house.

47:24.209 --> 47:25.752
Mam.

47:37.305 --> 47:39.766
Will you look at him?
The manners of a pig.

47:39.849 --> 47:41.810
He eats like a Presbyterian.

47:41.893 --> 47:45.814
Is it a millionaire you think I am?
An American?

47:45.855 --> 47:47.982
Is there any more tea in the pot, Mam?

47:48.024 --> 47:50.610
- Aye.
- I could do with a cup.

47:50.694 --> 47:53.530
You allright, Frankie?

47:53.571 --> 47:57.200
- What's the matter, Frankie?
- What's wrong with that child?

48:00.328 --> 48:03.707
Look what he did! He's thrown up
the body and blood of Jesus.

48:03.748 --> 48:07.669
What am I to do?
I have God in me backyard!

48:15.051 --> 48:16.970
I'm taking you to the priest.

48:17.053 --> 48:19.722
That was a dreadful thing
you did in my backyard.

48:23.560 --> 48:26.271
In the name of The Father
and of The Son and of the Holy Ghost.

48:26.354 --> 48:28.273
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

48:28.356 --> 48:30.275
It's been a day since my last confession.

48:30.358 --> 48:32.277
A day?

48:32.360 --> 48:34.946
And what sins have you committed
in a day, my son?

48:35.029 --> 48:38.116
I overslept, and I nearly missed
my First Communion.

48:38.199 --> 48:40.410
My hair stuck up like a Protestant's,

48:40.493 --> 48:43.204
and I threw up my First
Holy Communion breakfast.

48:43.246 --> 48:47.584
Now me grandma says she has God
in her backyard and what shall she do?

48:47.625 --> 48:51.588
Tell your grandma to wash it away
with a little water.

48:54.799 --> 48:57.093
Holy water or ordinary water?

48:57.135 --> 49:00.096
- He didn't say, Grandma.
- Well, go back and ask him.

49:06.769 --> 49:10.273
In the name of The Father
and of The Son and of The Holy Ghost.

49:10.356 --> 49:12.275
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

49:12.358 --> 49:14.736
It's been a minute
since my last confession.

49:14.777 --> 49:17.405
A minute? Are you the boy
that was just here?

49:17.447 --> 49:20.909
- I am, Father.
- What is it now?

49:20.950 --> 49:24.871
My grandma says holy water
or ordinary water?

49:28.124 --> 49:31.294
He says ordinary water,
and don't go bothering him again.

49:31.336 --> 49:33.171
Bothering him?

49:33.254 --> 49:36.216
Well, the ignorant old bog trotter.

49:38.509 --> 49:42.055
There wasn't anytime
for the Collection. Not a penny.

49:42.138 --> 49:44.766
So Mikey Molloy pretended
to have one of his fits...

49:44.849 --> 49:47.644
so that I could slip in
when no one was looking.

49:47.685 --> 49:49.896
- Missus, quick, He's having a fit!
- Is he all right?

49:49.979 --> 49:51.940
Mr. O'Brien, quick!

49:56.361 --> 49:59.447
Watch he doesn't swallow his tongue.

49:59.530 --> 50:03.826
Does anyone know what to do?

50:03.868 --> 50:07.830
- No, don't. I'll do anything.
- Oh, no, you won't.

50:07.872 --> 50:10.124
You've had your last chance.
You can take this with you.

50:10.166 --> 50:13.044
Shoot him!

50:13.127 --> 50:15.838
All you had to do was bump me off.

50:20.468 --> 50:23.304
- Do you want a toffee?
- Thanks.

50:28.017 --> 50:29.978
I'm glad I did the First Communion.

50:30.061 --> 50:32.939
I'm glad I got my First Confession
over and done with.

50:33.022 --> 50:37.443
Now I'm free to grow up.
Old enough to be ten, anyway.

50:37.485 --> 50:40.822
Old enough to pay the ultimate penance
for growing up.

50:40.905 --> 50:42.907
Worse than joining
the army or the police...

50:42.990 --> 50:46.411
or going to Australia
or becoming a nun in Africa.

50:46.494 --> 50:49.872
Worse than that,
I had to learn Irish dancing.

50:49.956 --> 50:54.168
I don't want to learn it.
Ow. What did you do that for?

50:54.252 --> 50:56.462
Just don't want to learn how to dance.

50:56.504 --> 50:58.464
...and back and back.

51:01.926 --> 51:05.805
Up and back and one, two.

51:05.847 --> 51:08.599
Lift up your feet, for the love of Jesus.

51:08.683 --> 51:12.145
One, two, three. And one, two, three.
And up and back, and one, two, three.

51:12.228 --> 51:14.272
And up and back, andone, two, three.

51:14.355 --> 51:16.524
If my mates saw me
making a pure eejit out of meself...

51:16.607 --> 51:19.318
at the Irish dancing,
I'd be disgraced forever.

51:19.402 --> 51:21.696
I want to be Fred Astaire.

51:21.779 --> 51:24.282
Irish dancers look like they have
steel rods stuck up their arses.

51:24.365 --> 51:26.659
Would you stop the frowning
Frankie McCourt?

51:26.742 --> 51:28.870
You've a face on you
like a pound of tripe.

51:28.953 --> 51:33.040
And up and back, and one, two, three.
And up and back, and one, two, three.

51:35.042 --> 51:39.839
The next time I went to dancing lessons,
I bumped into Paddy Clohessy.

51:39.922 --> 51:41.883
- Hi, Frankie.
- Hiya, Paddy. How you doing?

51:41.924 --> 51:45.052
- Not too bad. You?
- Grand. Catch.

51:45.136 --> 51:48.264
Frankie, I'm telling you,
that dancing stuff is for sissies.

51:48.347 --> 51:50.308
You won't be able to play football next.

51:50.391 --> 51:52.685
- I won't?
- You'll be running around girlie-like.

51:52.727 --> 51:55.438
- Shut up.
- Everyone will be laughing at you.

51:55.521 --> 51:59.567
- They will?
- Next thing, you'll be knitting socks.

52:07.742 --> 52:10.369
I was finished with the dancing.

52:10.453 --> 52:14.499
Every Saturday, my mam's sixpence
got me and Paddy into the Lyric...

52:14.582 --> 52:18.294
with enough left to stuff our gobs
with Cleeves' toffee.

52:26.427 --> 52:28.596
Yay!

52:28.679 --> 52:32.266
I was so happy, I didn't know whether
to shit or go blind.

52:35.770 --> 52:38.898
Every week, I'd take the money
and skip the dancing...

52:38.940 --> 52:40.900
and go to the pictures.

52:40.942 --> 52:43.402
When I got home,
I'd make up the dancing...

52:43.444 --> 52:46.113
- and pretend I had a poker up my arse.
- Well done, son.

52:47.782 --> 52:50.576
Hitler shows himself in his true colors.

52:50.618 --> 52:53.037
He marches his troops
into the Rhineland...

52:53.120 --> 52:55.915
in defiance of the terms
of the Treaty of Versailles.

52:58.709 --> 53:01.420
The swastika spreads its evil shadow.

53:03.506 --> 53:08.094
Sir, what use is Euclid when the Germans
are bombing everything in sight?

53:08.135 --> 53:10.638
What use is Euclid?

53:10.680 --> 53:12.848
Without Euclid,

53:12.932 --> 53:16.060
the Messerschmitt could never
have taken to the sky...

53:16.143 --> 53:18.396
and dart from cloud to cloud...

53:18.479 --> 53:21.357
and bomb the be jesus out of the English,

53:21.440 --> 53:24.819
who deserve it after what they
did to the Irish for 800 years.

53:24.902 --> 53:28.739
Euclid is grace and beauty...

53:28.823 --> 53:30.783
and elegance.

53:30.825 --> 53:33.995
- Do you understand that, boys?
- We do, sir.

53:34.078 --> 53:37.456
- We do, sir.
- I doubt it.

53:37.540 --> 53:41.794
To love Euclid is to be alone
in this world.

53:41.877 --> 53:45.339
You. Clohessy.

53:45.423 --> 53:48.217
Who stood at the foot of the cross
when our Lord was crucified?

53:49.552 --> 53:51.846
The Twelve Apostles, sir?

53:51.929 --> 53:55.141
Clohessy, what is the Irish word for fool?

53:55.224 --> 53:56.976
Omadhaun, sir.

53:57.059 --> 54:01.021
Sir. I know who stood
at the foot of the cross, sir.

54:01.105 --> 54:03.023
It was the three Marys, sir.

54:03.107 --> 54:05.943
That's Fintan Slattery.

54:06.026 --> 54:08.821
He's going to be a saint
when he gets older.

54:08.904 --> 54:11.490
Everyone know she wears
his sister's blouse at night...

54:11.574 --> 54:13.659
and curls his hair with hot iron tongs...

54:13.743 --> 54:17.037
so that he'll look gorgeous
at Mass on Sundays.

54:17.121 --> 54:19.290
It's no wonder we played truant.

54:19.373 --> 54:21.167
Chickens!

54:21.250 --> 54:23.335
Of all the girls I've known
and I've known some

54:23.419 --> 54:26.130
Untill first met you I was lonesome

54:26.213 --> 54:29.383
And when you came in sight
my heart grew light

54:29.467 --> 54:32.470
And this old world seemed new to me

54:32.553 --> 54:34.889
You're really swell I have to admit you

54:34.972 --> 54:37.141
Deserve expressions that really fit you

54:37.224 --> 54:40.019
Hurry up, Frankie. I can't hold them.

54:40.060 --> 54:44.356
I've racked my brain hoping to explain
all the things that you do to me

54:44.398 --> 54:50.821
Bei mir bist du schon
please let me explain

54:50.905 --> 54:53.157
Frankie, there's nothing in the world...

54:53.240 --> 54:56.035
like a good feed of apples
and a drink of water...

54:56.118 --> 55:00.331
and a good shit and plenty of grass
to wipe your arse with.

55:02.333 --> 55:04.877
Paddy, quick, wipe your arse.
It's milking time!

55:04.960 --> 55:07.630
Will you wait for me? Frankie, wait.

55:09.590 --> 55:12.218
Frankie, you're doing it wrong.
You've got to pull it down.

55:12.301 --> 55:14.929
- You have to squeeze down.
- Shut up!

55:15.012 --> 55:17.598
- Shut up!
- Frankie, don't!

55:17.681 --> 55:21.393
- Hey, clear off, you little bastards!
- Run, Paddy, run!

55:21.477 --> 55:24.730
I'll give you such a kick in the hole,
you won't know what hit you.

55:24.813 --> 55:27.483
Here, piggy.

55:27.566 --> 55:30.444
Mikey Molloy persuaded
us to go to Peter Dooley's house.

55:30.528 --> 55:33.405
Peter Dooley has a hump like
the one Charles Laughton had...

55:33.489 --> 55:35.908
in The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

55:35.950 --> 55:37.451
That's why they call him Quasimodo.

55:37.493 --> 55:42.414
Oh, and he has these four sisters
with the enormous breasts.

55:44.458 --> 55:46.669
Okay, it's a shilling
for the three of you.

55:46.752 --> 55:49.922
Climb up the spout, and each of youse
have a look, but no wankin'.

55:49.964 --> 55:52.591
I've my own sisters. Why should I pay
to see your naked sisters?

55:52.675 --> 55:56.512
'Cause looking at your own naked sisters
is the worst sin ofall.

55:56.595 --> 55:59.932
Not even a bishop in the world could
forgive you for it.

56:00.015 --> 56:01.976
What canyousee?

56:02.017 --> 56:04.728
- Oh, it's grand.
- Can you see their tits?

56:07.147 --> 56:10.276
I said no wankin'.
There's to be no wankin' up the spout.

56:10.317 --> 56:12.945
- Oh, it's grand.
- I said no wankin' up the spout!

56:18.867 --> 56:22.121
- You perverted bunch of filth!
- Let go!

56:22.162 --> 56:25.791
My daughters can't even wash
themselves on a Friday night!

56:25.833 --> 56:29.086
Poor Quasimodo. He was right.

56:29.169 --> 56:32.923
Gawking at your own naked sisters
is the worst sin of all.

56:33.007 --> 56:35.384
Except when you charge
a shilling for the pleasure.

56:35.467 --> 56:37.511
That's worse still.

56:37.678 --> 56:41.557
Introibo adaltare Dei. And then you say?

56:41.640 --> 56:44.977
Ad Deum quila etificat juventutem meam.

56:45.019 --> 56:49.023
Right. Introibo adaltare Dei,
and then you say?

56:49.106 --> 56:52.484
Ad Deum quila etificat juventutem meam.

56:52.526 --> 56:54.486
Very good. Again. Introibo ad-

56:56.030 --> 56:58.323
Ad Deum quila etificat juventutem mean.

56:58.365 --> 57:02.870
Hello. How are you?
This is my son, Francis.

57:02.953 --> 57:07.332
He can recite the Latin,
and he's ready to be an altarboy.

57:07.374 --> 57:09.918
- Ad Deum-
- I'm sorry. We have no room.

57:20.971 --> 57:22.931
Never mind, son.

57:26.685 --> 57:30.022
Sacred Stan
said there was no room for him.

57:41.784 --> 57:45.078
I'll tell you what it is.

57:45.162 --> 57:48.040
'Tis class distinction.

57:50.167 --> 57:53.253
They don't want the boys
from the lanes at the altar.

57:53.337 --> 57:55.589
They don't want the ones
with the scabby knees...

57:55.672 --> 57:58.425
and their arses hanging
out of their trousers.

58:00.511 --> 58:03.013
They want the boys with the nice shoes
and the clean hair...

58:03.055 --> 58:05.682
and the fathers with the steady jobs.

58:05.766 --> 58:07.768
Not useless like you.

58:10.354 --> 58:13.899
That's what it is.

58:13.982 --> 58:17.194
And it's hard to hang on to your faith.

58:38.507 --> 58:42.177
You buy pints for people you don't know
who tell you you're a grand man,

58:42.261 --> 58:45.597
while your children are at home with
their bellies stuck to their backbones.

58:48.308 --> 58:51.228
Aye, you're right.

58:51.270 --> 58:53.480
I'll get a job. I promise.

58:53.564 --> 58:55.691
If you get a job,
you lose it the third week...

58:55.732 --> 58:57.693
because you drink all the wages...

58:57.734 --> 59:01.029
and you miss the work.

59:01.071 --> 59:03.573
We'll get by, Angela.

59:03.615 --> 59:05.617
I'll change.

59:08.287 --> 59:10.914
The dole is 19 shillings
and the rent is 6.

59:10.998 --> 59:15.544
And that leaves 13 shillings
to feed and clothe 5 people.

59:18.005 --> 59:20.590
God is good, you know.

59:23.427 --> 59:25.554
God might be good for someone somewhere,

59:25.637 --> 59:28.015
but he hasn't been seen lately
in the lanes of Limerick.

59:30.058 --> 59:31.977
Oh, Angela.

59:34.563 --> 59:37.065
You could go to hell for saying that.

59:41.486 --> 59:43.864
Aren't I there already, Malachy?

59:50.495 --> 59:52.748
Come here. Come here.

01:00:09.056 --> 01:00:13.602
And then the angels
left another baby on the stairs again.

01:00:15.687 --> 01:00:17.647
What are you going to call him, Angela?

01:00:17.731 --> 01:00:20.108
I like the name Kevin or Sean.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:23.487
If you called out the door,
"Kevin, Sean, come in for your tea,"

01:00:23.528 --> 01:00:26.782
you'd have half of Limerick
running at you.

01:00:26.865 --> 01:00:30.118
- I like the name Alphonsus.
- Alphonsus?

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.287
That's a stupid name.

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:34.289
Ah, Jesus Christ!

01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:38.877
- Don't curse!
- Will you leave the poor child alone?

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.713
I wondered how many more babies...

01:00:41.797 --> 01:00:43.715
the angels would leave on the stairs.

01:00:43.799 --> 01:00:45.967
Someone else to share my dinner with.

01:00:46.051 --> 01:00:48.011
Ow. What did you do that for?

01:00:48.053 --> 01:00:50.347
Don't laugh.
Now you know what it feels like.

01:00:51.765 --> 01:00:54.351
At least my grandpa in the North...

01:00:54.434 --> 01:00:57.312
sent us five pounds for the baby Alphie.

01:00:57.354 --> 01:01:01.316
All right. You go home and tell your
mother I'll be back in a few minutes.

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:03.318
You're not to go to the pub, Da.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.320
Mom said you're to bring home the money.

01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:08.824
- You're not to drink the pint.
- Now listen.

01:01:08.907 --> 01:01:11.743
- You go home to your mother now.
- Da.

01:01:11.827 --> 01:01:14.371
Give us the money.
That money is for the new baby.

01:01:14.454 --> 01:01:16.414
Da!

01:01:16.498 --> 01:01:18.416
Please, Da.

01:01:22.587 --> 01:01:24.548
Go home!

01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:38.562
Will you come in here, Frankie?

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:44.025
I want you to go down to South's Pub,

01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:46.653
and I want you to stand
in the middle of the pub...

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:51.575
and tell every man that your father
is drinking the money for the baby.

01:01:51.658 --> 01:01:53.994
You're to tell the world there's not
a scrap of food in the house.

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:56.538
There's not a lump of coal for the fire.

01:01:56.621 --> 01:02:00.292
There's not even a drop of milk
for the baby's bottle.

01:02:05.714 --> 01:02:07.716
Oh, come on.

01:02:22.981 --> 01:02:28.778
And I pray that the world
would in peace let me be

01:02:28.862 --> 01:02:32.449
And the green glens of Antrim

01:02:32.532 --> 01:02:36.328
Are welcoming me

01:02:36.369 --> 01:02:39.205
And if you only knew

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:41.416
How the light of the moon

01:02:41.499 --> 01:02:45.253
My heart is banging
away, and all I can think of doing...

01:02:45.337 --> 01:02:48.298
is giving him a good kick
in the leg and running away.

01:02:48.381 --> 01:02:51.301
- You'd imagine a picture
- But I don't.

01:02:51.384 --> 01:02:54.679
Because I remember all the nice times
he sat me by the fire...

01:02:54.721 --> 01:02:59.142
and told me his stories of Cuchulain,
Roosevelt and De Valera.

01:03:02.604 --> 01:03:06.608
Later, he'll be home singing and
offering us a penny to die for Ireland.

01:03:06.691 --> 01:03:09.277
It'll be different now.

01:03:09.361 --> 01:03:12.322
Because it's bad enough
to drink the dole or the wages,

01:03:12.405 --> 01:03:16.910
but a man who drinks the money for
a new baby has gone beyond the beyonds.

01:03:33.259 --> 01:03:35.178
Mam.

01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:40.100
I couldn't find him.

01:03:40.183 --> 01:03:42.811
Go to bed, Frankie.

01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:57.158
With Confirmation,

01:03:57.242 --> 01:03:59.994
you will become
true soldiers of the Church.

01:04:00.078 --> 01:04:04.833
That entitles you to die a martyr...

01:04:04.916 --> 01:04:07.752
in the event we're invaded
by Protestants...

01:04:07.836 --> 01:04:12.173
or Mohammedans
or any other class of heathen.

01:04:12.257 --> 01:04:14.175
You will have the gifts...

01:04:14.259 --> 01:04:17.136
of the Holy Ghost. Wisdom...

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.974
understanding, counsel.

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:23.351
What is the Third Station
of the Cross, my child?

01:04:23.434 --> 01:04:25.436
When Jesus falls for the first time.

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:32.986
What is the Fourth Commandment, my child?

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:35.947
Honor thy father and thy mother.

01:04:39.284 --> 01:04:42.579
Are you allright, Frankie?

01:05:06.853 --> 01:05:10.023
Father Gorey
is touching me with oil and praying,

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:12.317
and that means I'm going to die.

01:05:14.193 --> 01:05:16.112
But I don't care.

01:05:22.535 --> 01:05:26.039
And then Dr. Campbell
came in and held my hand.

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:29.000
It was then that I knew
I was going to get better.

01:05:32.378 --> 01:05:34.964
Because a doctor would never fart...

01:05:35.048 --> 01:05:37.967
in the presence of a dying boy.

01:05:46.559 --> 01:05:49.645
They gave me a whole new body
full of blood.

01:05:49.729 --> 01:05:53.691
Sister Rita said it came from
a soldier at Sarsfield Barracks.

01:06:08.664 --> 01:06:11.876
Oh, son.

01:06:11.918 --> 01:06:14.379
You're a grand old soldier.

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:17.423
What's wrong with me?

01:06:19.175 --> 01:06:21.469
You've had the typhoid.

01:06:26.599 --> 01:06:29.268
Don't go.

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:33.731
Hey, you're a big boy now.

01:06:33.815 --> 01:06:37.902
And don't forget you got
soldier's blood in you.

01:06:40.571 --> 01:06:42.490
You're over the worst of it.

01:06:42.573 --> 01:06:46.536
Soon be home to Sorrento.

01:07:00.633 --> 01:07:03.928
That was the first
time my dad ever kissed me.

01:07:04.011 --> 01:07:08.224
I felt so happy I could have floated
out of the bed.

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:26.617
Everyday, I couldn't wait
for the doctors and nurses...

01:07:26.659 --> 01:07:28.870
to leave me alone so that
Icould read my books.

01:07:28.953 --> 01:07:30.913
I loved having a lavatory of my own...

01:07:30.997 --> 01:07:33.958
where I could read for hours and hours.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.004
"To die, to sleep.
To sleep, perchance to dream.

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:40.089
Aye, there's the rub."

01:07:40.172 --> 01:07:42.133
Frankie, are you dead?

01:07:42.174 --> 01:07:44.594
Isn't it grand, Seamus? It's Shakespeare.

01:07:44.677 --> 01:07:46.679
I loved the Shakespeare.

01:07:46.762 --> 01:07:49.849
It was like having jewels in your mouth
when you said the words.

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:53.144
"I do believe, induced
by potent circumstances,

01:07:53.185 --> 01:07:55.146
that thou art mine enemy."

01:07:55.187 --> 01:07:58.566
"I do believe, induced
by potent circumstances,

01:07:58.649 --> 01:08:00.985
that thou art mine enemy."

01:08:01.027 --> 01:08:04.614
"I do believe, induced
by potent circumstances,

01:08:04.697 --> 01:08:07.199
that thou art mine enemy."

01:08:07.283 --> 01:08:09.619
- Bye! Bye!
- There's Frankie.

01:08:09.702 --> 01:08:12.663
But I missed me mom and dad and Malachy...

01:08:12.705 --> 01:08:15.625
and little Michael
and the baby Alphie- God knows why.

01:08:15.708 --> 01:08:18.502
- Frankie, will you hurry up now?
- Bye.

01:08:18.544 --> 01:08:22.089
It was a happy day
when I finally went home.

01:08:25.843 --> 01:08:28.929
- Hello, Frankie.
- Welcome home, Frankie.

01:08:29.013 --> 01:08:30.930
You're a grand soldier, Frankie.

01:08:31.015 --> 01:08:33.517
A credit to your mother and father.

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.560
Welcome home, Frankie.

01:08:37.188 --> 01:08:40.566
Hello, Frankie.

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:44.904
It's grand to have you home, soldier.

01:08:44.987 --> 01:08:47.281
Thank you, Mrs. Purcell.

01:08:47.365 --> 01:08:49.325
Goodman, Frankie.

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:57.332
Ah, Francis, my boy.

01:08:57.416 --> 01:09:00.252
But the moment
I saw me dad with Alphie on his lap...

01:09:00.336 --> 01:09:02.337
was an empty feeling in my heart,

01:09:02.421 --> 01:09:04.840
because I know he's out of work again.

01:09:04.924 --> 01:09:07.385
- Welcome home, son.
- Da.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.639
It's good to see you.

01:09:11.721 --> 01:09:14.140
You too.

01:09:14.225 --> 01:09:16.310
Get a wee sit, right?

01:09:16.394 --> 01:09:19.647
St. Wilgefortis' mom had nine children.

01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:23.692
But still, I loved
having my dad to myself in the morning.

01:09:23.734 --> 01:09:27.321
I loved his stories where motorcars
and planes went under water.

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:29.990
Submarines flew up in the air,

01:09:30.073 --> 01:09:32.910
and polar bears wrestled
with elephants on the moon.

01:09:32.993 --> 01:09:36.330
He was the Holy Trinity, wasmy dad,
with three people in him.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:40.709
The one in the morning with his tea
and Woodbines telling us the stories.

01:09:40.751 --> 01:09:44.712
The one who tried so hard
to find work but never did.

01:09:51.804 --> 01:09:56.308
And the one who came home at night
with the smell of whiskey on him.

01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:17.872
But he was reading all the time
he was at the hospital.

01:10:17.955 --> 01:10:21.542
I'm sorry, Mrs. McCourt.
He's missed over two months of school.

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:26.046
He'll have to go back to the fifth
class. I'm really very sorry.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:52.364
Mom, I don't want to go back
to fifth class.

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:55.284
Malachy's in fifth class,
and I'm a year older than him.

01:10:55.367 --> 01:10:57.328
Oh, come on, Frankie.

01:10:57.411 --> 01:11:00.372
But all me friends will laugh at me
because I've been put back.

01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:02.374
No.

01:11:09.298 --> 01:11:11.675
What I needed was a miracle,

01:11:11.759 --> 01:11:16.472
and it happened right there outside
the Our Lady Of Liberty Pub.

01:11:16.513 --> 01:11:19.183
I looked up at her. She smiled.

01:11:19.266 --> 01:11:21.268
And when I looked down, there was a penny.

01:11:37.826 --> 01:11:40.037
I spent the penny on a candle...

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:44.958
and prayed to St. Francis for him to
get me out of my little brother's class.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.336
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name-

01:11:47.544 --> 01:11:51.924
Take that sour look off your puss,
Francis McCourt,

01:11:52.007 --> 01:11:54.134
or you will feel the end of my stick.

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:56.470
Francis McCourt is going to show you...

01:11:56.512 --> 01:12:00.849
how well he learned
to write in this class last year.

01:12:00.933 --> 01:12:04.144
He's going to write a composition
on our Lord.

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:06.689
Aren't you, McCourt?

01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:11.568
He's to tell us what it would be like
if our Lord had grown up in Limerick,

01:12:11.652 --> 01:12:13.612
the holiest city in Ireland.

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:17.825
Wilgefortis' dad wanted to marry her
off to the King of Sicily,

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:20.160
but the beautiful, young Wilgefortis...

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:23.122
was desperate not to marry
the scabby old man.

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:25.124
Oh.

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:27.501
And McCourt scores a brilliant goal.

01:12:33.006 --> 01:12:37.302
They said that Limerick
was the holiest city,

01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:40.556
but everyone knewthe reason why there
were always people in the churches.

01:12:40.639 --> 01:12:42.933
It was because it was always raining,

01:12:43.016 --> 01:12:45.018
and they were in there
to get out of the wet.

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:47.104
The name of my composition is-

01:12:47.187 --> 01:12:51.066
Title, McCourt. The title.

01:12:51.108 --> 01:12:54.403
The title of my composition
is "Jesus and the Weather."

01:12:54.486 --> 01:12:56.864
What?

01:12:56.905 --> 01:12:59.408
"Jesus and the Weather," sir.

01:12:59.450 --> 01:13:01.910
All right, read it.

01:13:01.952 --> 01:13:04.121
"I don't think Jesus, who is our Lord,

01:13:04.204 --> 01:13:06.373
would have liked the weather in Limerick,

01:13:06.457 --> 01:13:10.752
because it's always raining and
the Shannon keeps the whole city damp.

01:13:10.794 --> 01:13:13.714
My father says the Shannon
is a killer river...

01:13:13.755 --> 01:13:15.716
because it killed my two brothers.

01:13:15.757 --> 01:13:17.718
When you look at pictures of Jesus,

01:13:17.759 --> 01:13:21.847
He's always wandering around
ancient Israel in a sheet.

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:25.267
It never rains there, and you never hear
of anyone coughing...

01:13:25.309 --> 01:13:28.145
or getting the consumption
or anything like that.

01:13:28.228 --> 01:13:31.899
And no one has a job there,
because all they do is stand around,

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:36.862
eat manna, shake their fists,
and go to crucifixions.

01:13:36.945 --> 01:13:40.657
Any time Jesus got hungry, all He had
to do was to walk up the road...

01:13:40.741 --> 01:13:43.952
to a fig tree oran orange tree
and have His fill.

01:13:43.994 --> 01:13:46.997
Or if He wanted a pint, He could
wave Hish and over a big glass...

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.999
and there was the pint.

01:13:49.082 --> 01:13:52.586
Or He could visit Mary Magdalene
and her sister Martha,

01:13:52.628 --> 01:13:55.380
and they'd give Him His dinner,
no questions asked.

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:59.760
So it's a good thing Jesus decided to
be born Jewish in that nice warm place.

01:13:59.801 --> 01:14:02.638
Because if He was born in Limerick,
He'd catch the consumption...

01:14:02.679 --> 01:14:06.099
and be dead in a month, and there
wouldn't be any Catholic Church,

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:08.393
and we wouldn't have to write
compositions about Him.

01:14:08.477 --> 01:14:10.395
The end."

01:14:12.856 --> 01:14:15.150
Did you write this composition, McCourt?

01:14:15.192 --> 01:14:18.028
I did, sir.

01:14:19.863 --> 01:14:21.823
The miracle worked.

01:14:21.865 --> 01:14:24.326
I was back in my old class.

01:14:24.368 --> 01:14:26.328
Stock your mind.

01:14:26.370 --> 01:14:28.330
It's your house of treasure,

01:14:28.372 --> 01:14:31.667
and no one in the world
can interfere with it.

01:14:31.708 --> 01:14:36.630
Fill your mind with rubbish,
and it'll rot your head.

01:14:36.672 --> 01:14:40.467
You might be poor,
your shoes might be broken,

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:42.469
but your mind-

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:46.974
your mind is a palace.

01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:50.644
And McCourt gets the ball,
he goes round one man...

01:14:50.727 --> 01:14:52.604
he goes up to the second man-

01:14:52.688 --> 01:14:54.815
Peggy! Sean!

01:14:54.898 --> 01:14:57.776
Kathleen, come in for your tea.

01:14:57.859 --> 01:14:59.778
Come in for the lovely leg of lamb...

01:14:59.861 --> 01:15:04.032
and the gorgeous green peas,
and the floury white potatoes.

01:15:04.074 --> 01:15:06.827
Oh, shut up, will you, woman?

01:15:06.868 --> 01:15:09.079
It's a low-class mind
to torment your neighbors...

01:15:09.162 --> 01:15:11.081
when there's nothing
but bread and tea we have.

01:15:11.164 --> 01:15:13.458
Get off to work in England
like the rest of our husbands.

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:15.460
Go and help England win a war?

01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:17.462
I wouldn't give the English
the steam off my pish.

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:19.631
No, you'd rather drink the dole...

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:22.092
and watch your sons
run around all skin and bone...

01:15:22.175 --> 01:15:24.428
with their arse hanging out
of their trousers.

01:15:24.511 --> 01:15:26.847
Kathleen, come in for your tea.

01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:29.015
If I could work,
I'd be in the English factories.

01:15:29.099 --> 01:15:31.643
A factory's no place for a woman.

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:34.730
Sitting on your arse
is no place for a man.

01:15:35.939 --> 01:15:39.109
And the game restarts in the second half.

01:15:39.151 --> 01:15:41.361
He's got the ball. He's going on the run.

01:15:41.445 --> 01:15:43.363
Oh, you got the ball off him.

01:15:53.165 --> 01:15:55.959
Get off me, will you?

01:15:56.001 --> 01:16:00.422
I'm worn out.

01:16:00.464 --> 01:16:03.258
That's the end of it for me.
No more children.

01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:07.971
A good Catholic woman should perform
her wifely duties.

01:16:08.054 --> 01:16:09.973
Oh, feck off, will you?

01:16:14.769 --> 01:16:18.231
You'll face eternal damnation, Angela.

01:16:18.315 --> 01:16:20.233
Well, as long as there
are no more children,

01:16:20.317 --> 01:16:23.737
eternal damnation sounds just fine
to me, Malachy.

01:16:47.594 --> 01:16:50.013
Come on, lads, come on.
You'll miss the train.

01:16:50.096 --> 01:16:52.015
You'll miss a good job. Come on.

01:16:52.098 --> 01:16:54.935
We've got the Guinness, and we've
got the Jameson in England, all right?

01:17:10.367 --> 01:17:13.119
Right. Uh-

01:17:13.203 --> 01:17:15.163
Remember your religious duties.

01:17:17.374 --> 01:17:20.543
And above all, you obey
your mother, right?

01:17:22.504 --> 01:17:26.258
You're the man of the house now, Francis.

01:17:28.385 --> 01:17:30.679
Mind yourself.

01:17:42.232 --> 01:17:44.442
Come on. Let's go.

01:17:59.582 --> 01:18:02.836
Mam said all
we had to do was wait two weeks...

01:18:02.919 --> 01:18:04.838
for the telegram with the money order.

01:18:04.921 --> 01:18:07.757
Soon we'd have enough money
for new boots and coats,

01:18:07.841 --> 01:18:10.051
ham, cabbage and potatoes for dinner,

01:18:10.093 --> 01:18:13.555
electric light and maybe even a lavatory
like they have in America.

01:18:13.596 --> 01:18:15.557
Now that Dad is gone to England,

01:18:15.598 --> 01:18:18.059
sure I your troubles would be over.

01:18:18.143 --> 01:18:20.061
Surely.

01:18:33.116 --> 01:18:36.202
- Hello. Thank you very much.
- Hi.

01:18:36.286 --> 01:18:39.080
- Thank you.
- There he is!

01:18:41.291 --> 01:18:44.627
Hey, wait! Has ours come? McCourt?

01:18:44.711 --> 01:18:47.422
- No.
- Are you sure? It's our first telegram.

01:18:47.505 --> 01:18:50.842
It should be for about three pounds
or maybe more.

01:18:50.925 --> 01:18:53.219
- Sorry.
- Can you look in your pouch again?

01:18:53.303 --> 01:18:56.139
I feckin' did already.
I've nothing for you.

01:19:31.090 --> 01:19:34.594
- Who's a good boy?
- Alphie!

01:19:36.679 --> 01:19:40.725
Begging for leftovers
is worse than the dole.

01:19:40.808 --> 01:19:45.104
Worse than the St. Vincent
de Paul Charity. My own mother begging.

01:19:45.188 --> 01:19:48.107
This is the worst kind of shame-

01:19:48.191 --> 01:19:50.485
begging for the leftovers
from the priests' dinner.

01:19:50.527 --> 01:19:54.447
Like tinkers holding up
their scabby children on street corners.

01:19:54.531 --> 01:19:58.159
Worse than borrowing
from the money lender, Mrs. Finucane.

01:20:16.636 --> 01:20:18.638
There was only one thing for it.

01:20:18.721 --> 01:20:21.474
I had to get a job.

01:20:27.021 --> 01:20:29.732
This is the best morning of all, Frankie,

01:20:29.816 --> 01:20:32.193
Saturday half day.

01:20:32.235 --> 01:20:36.197
We start at 8:00 and finish
by the time the Angelus rings at 12:00.

01:20:55.883 --> 01:20:58.594
The dipsy doodle is the thing to beware

01:20:58.678 --> 01:21:01.639
The dipsy doodle is gonna get in your hair

01:21:01.723 --> 01:21:03.850
And if it gets you it couldn't be worse

01:21:03.933 --> 01:21:06.853
The things you say will
all come out in reverse

01:21:06.936 --> 01:21:09.439
Don't go up the mine, Manny

01:21:09.522 --> 01:21:12.817
That's the way the dipsy doodle works

01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:15.069
The dipsy doodle isso easy to find

01:21:15.153 --> 01:21:18.322
It's almost always
at the back of your mind

01:21:18.406 --> 01:21:21.409
You never know it's there
until it's too late

01:21:21.492 --> 01:21:23.703
And then you get in such a terrible state

01:21:23.786 --> 01:21:26.372
The moon jumped over the cow, hey diddle

01:21:26.456 --> 01:21:28.708
That's the way the dipsy doodle works

01:21:51.606 --> 01:21:56.027
The man who delivered 16 hundred weight
of coal deserves a pint.

01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:58.404
And the boy who helped him
deserves a lemonade.

01:21:59.989 --> 01:22:03.534
Your eyes look atrocious-
like two piss-holes in the snow.

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:08.456
- It's the coal dust, Uncle Pa.
- You're a great man, Frank.

01:22:08.539 --> 01:22:11.125
You can help me
every Thursday after school.

01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:13.294
There's a shilling foryou.

01:22:13.377 --> 01:22:15.505
More power to your elbow, Frankie.

01:22:15.546 --> 01:22:18.591
He'll be taking yourjob yet,
you know, John.

01:22:22.887 --> 01:22:26.098
He called me Frank, not Frankie.

01:22:26.182 --> 01:22:28.643
For the first time, I feel like a man.

01:22:28.726 --> 01:22:30.686
A man with a shilling in his pocket.

01:22:30.728 --> 01:22:32.980
A man who had a drink in a pub.

01:22:40.488 --> 01:22:45.076
Ma, I earned a shilling.

01:22:45.159 --> 01:22:48.621
Take tuppence, Frankie,
and take Malachy to the Lyric.

01:22:48.704 --> 01:22:52.041
You're a treasure, Frankie.
You deserve it.

01:22:52.124 --> 01:22:55.086
God above, look at those eyes.

01:23:16.607 --> 01:23:18.234
Frankie!

01:23:20.945 --> 01:23:22.905
Frankie!

01:23:25.575 --> 01:23:28.744
A shilling from Mr. Hannon,
and four shillings in tips.

01:23:30.871 --> 01:23:33.791
Will you go to that mirror
and look at your eyes?

01:23:39.755 --> 01:23:42.091
Oh, jeez.

01:23:42.133 --> 01:23:44.218
That's the end of it. No more Mr. Hannon.

01:23:44.302 --> 01:23:46.220
Mr. Hannon needs me.

01:23:46.304 --> 01:23:48.681
I'm sorry for Mr. Hannon's troubles,

01:23:48.764 --> 01:23:51.309
but we have troubles of our own.

01:23:51.392 --> 01:23:54.353
And the last thing I need is a blind son.

01:23:54.437 --> 01:23:57.106
Now, wash your eyes,
and you can go to the Lyric.

01:24:03.904 --> 01:24:06.741
Malachy, what's happening?

01:24:06.824 --> 01:24:10.578
The man in the hat is sticking a gold
dagger into the nice lady's belly.

01:24:10.661 --> 01:24:13.664
- Is there blood all over?
- No. She's showing a magic ring.

01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:15.958
I can't see a thing.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.134
The doctor said...

01:24:25.217 --> 01:24:27.136
this was the worst case of
conjunctivit is he'd ever seen.

01:24:27.178 --> 01:24:29.472
How long will he be in, Doctor?

01:24:29.513 --> 01:24:31.474
Only God knows that, woman.

01:24:31.515 --> 01:24:33.476
I should have seen this child months ago.

01:24:33.517 --> 01:24:35.352
My working days were over.

01:24:35.436 --> 01:24:40.107
Eyes wide open. Wider. Wide as you can.

01:24:40.191 --> 01:24:43.986
- Ow, Ma!
- If only dad was here.

01:25:42.545 --> 01:25:46.006
He's not coming, Mam.

01:25:46.048 --> 01:25:48.008
He might be asleep
in one of the carriages.

01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:51.178
Come on, Mam. Let's go home.
He's not coming.

01:25:56.976 --> 01:26:00.771
He definitely said in his letter
two days before Christmas.

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:02.773
Maybe the boat from Holyhead was late.

01:26:02.856 --> 01:26:04.775
That could make you miss your train.

01:26:04.858 --> 01:26:06.777
The Irish Sea's desperate
this time of year.

01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:09.780
He doesn't care about us.
He's over there drunk in England.

01:26:09.863 --> 01:26:11.782
Don't talk about your father like that.

01:26:14.493 --> 01:26:17.580
- Boots!
- Me! Me!

01:26:17.663 --> 01:26:19.915
Next.

01:26:19.999 --> 01:26:22.167
And where's the husband?

01:26:22.251 --> 01:26:24.211
He's in England, sir.

01:26:24.253 --> 01:26:26.213
England, is it?

01:26:26.255 --> 01:26:29.174
And where's the weekly telegram?
The big five pounds?

01:26:29.216 --> 01:26:31.510
He didn't send us a penny in months, sir.

01:26:31.594 --> 01:26:34.888
Well, we all probably know why, don't we?

01:26:37.891 --> 01:26:39.351
No, sir.

01:26:39.393 --> 01:26:42.730
We all know there's more than
an occasional Limerick man...

01:26:42.813 --> 01:26:47.735
been seen trotting around with
a Piccadilly tart, don't we?

01:26:47.776 --> 01:26:50.654
He's not in Piccadilly, sir.
He's in Coventry.

01:26:50.738 --> 01:26:55.659
Mam went begging
again at the St. Vincent de Paul.

01:26:55.743 --> 01:26:59.663
She got a food voucher so that at least
we could have a Christmas dinner.

01:27:09.298 --> 01:27:11.633
And then, on Christmas Eve,

01:27:11.717 --> 01:27:14.011
our neighbor, Walter the horse, died.

01:27:14.094 --> 01:27:17.264
And our dad came home.

01:27:17.306 --> 01:27:19.266
It's Pa!

01:27:19.266 --> 01:27:21.268
Dad! Dad!

01:27:42.664 --> 01:27:44.625
Hey.

01:27:44.666 --> 01:27:48.670
- We were expecting you yesterday.
- Aye, well.

01:27:52.299 --> 01:27:54.468
Jesus and Mary,
what have you done to yourself?

01:27:54.551 --> 01:27:56.553
Well, that Irish Sea
was very rough, you know.

01:27:56.637 --> 01:28:01.433
Bumped my head. Nearly fell over the side.

01:28:01.517 --> 01:28:03.519
Wouldn't be a fight, would it?
Wouldn't be the drink?

01:28:05.646 --> 01:28:08.190
You said you'd bring us something.

01:28:13.737 --> 01:28:16.490
Well, uh,

01:28:16.532 --> 01:28:18.492
I have.

01:28:24.706 --> 01:28:27.042
Got a bit peckish on the boat, did you?

01:28:30.170 --> 01:28:33.340
We'll have them tomorrow
after our Christmas dinner.

01:28:34.383 --> 01:28:36.343
Did you bring any money?

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:41.807
You drank the money, didn't you?

01:28:43.684 --> 01:28:48.522
Well, times are hard, Angela.
Jobs are scarce.

01:28:48.564 --> 01:28:53.026
- You drank the money, Da?
- You drank the money.

01:28:57.948 --> 01:29:01.869
So they have no respect
for their father now, eh?

01:29:05.789 --> 01:29:08.000
- I have to go and see a man.
- Go and see a man,

01:29:08.083 --> 01:29:10.669
but don't be coming home drunk,
singing your stupid songs.

01:29:38.905 --> 01:29:40.949
Eat something. It's Christmas.

01:29:42.868 --> 01:29:45.495
I'm not hungry.

01:29:45.579 --> 01:29:47.831
But if no one wants them,
I'll have one of them sheep's eyes.

01:29:47.914 --> 01:29:50.709
- Oh, not the eyes, Dad.
- Da, don't.

01:29:50.792 --> 01:29:53.587
- Oh, Dad, don't.
- What's the matter with you?

01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:56.757
You're notgoing to eat that, are you? Oh!

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:59.593
Dad, oh, yuck.

01:29:59.635 --> 01:30:02.054
- You're disgusting.
- Lovely.

01:30:02.137 --> 01:30:05.599
There's great nourishment in the eyes.

01:30:13.106 --> 01:30:15.025
Right.

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:20.238
Where are you going?

01:30:20.322 --> 01:30:22.240
Going to London.

01:30:24.201 --> 01:30:26.244
On Christmas Day?

01:30:26.328 --> 01:30:28.288
It's the best day to travel.

01:30:28.330 --> 01:30:30.207
People in motorcars
are always willing to give...

01:30:30.290 --> 01:30:32.959
the working man a lift to Dublin.

01:30:33.043 --> 01:30:35.629
Think of all the hard times
of the Holy Family and feel guilty.

01:30:35.712 --> 01:30:37.923
How will you get to Holyhead?

01:30:38.006 --> 01:30:41.718
Same way I came.

01:30:41.802 --> 01:30:44.679
There's always a time
when no one's looking.

01:30:52.854 --> 01:30:54.773
Right.

01:30:59.194 --> 01:31:02.614
You be good boys, eh? Say your prayers.

01:31:02.697 --> 01:31:04.616
Obey your mother.

01:31:10.163 --> 01:31:13.166
I'll write.

01:31:17.379 --> 01:31:19.297
Here, pass them down.

01:31:22.342 --> 01:31:24.761
Mmm. I got a nut.

01:31:24.845 --> 01:31:28.515
I didn't get a nut.
How come Frankie always gets a nut?

01:31:28.557 --> 01:31:31.059
Nuts are good for sore eyes.

01:31:31.143 --> 01:31:33.353
I've a Turkish Delight.

01:31:33.436 --> 01:31:35.438
Will the nut make his eyes better?

01:31:35.522 --> 01:31:37.440
'Twill.

01:31:37.524 --> 01:31:39.442
One eye or two eyes?

01:31:39.526 --> 01:31:42.320
Two eyes, I think.

01:31:42.404 --> 01:31:46.324
Frankie, if I had a nut,
I'd give it to you. I would, really.

01:31:46.408 --> 01:31:49.578
Mam, can me and Michael
have another chocolate? Just the one.

01:32:32.203 --> 01:32:36.124
If I were in America,
I could say, "I love you, Dad, "

01:32:36.166 --> 01:32:38.543
the way they do in the films.

01:32:38.627 --> 01:32:40.754
But in Limerick, they'd laugh at you.

01:32:40.837 --> 01:32:42.797
In Limerick, you're only allowed to say...

01:32:42.839 --> 01:32:45.926
you love God and babies
and horses that win.

01:32:46.009 --> 01:32:48.970
Anything else is softness in the head.

01:32:49.012 --> 01:32:51.681
Go home, Frankie.

01:33:08.490 --> 01:33:11.451
In another week,
a telegram arrived for three pounds,

01:33:11.493 --> 01:33:15.080
and we were in heaven.

01:33:20.210 --> 01:33:23.797
The next Saturday, there was no telegram.

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:26.216
Nor the week after.

01:33:26.299 --> 01:33:29.427
Nor any Saturday forever.

01:33:59.582 --> 01:34:01.501
What are you doing?

01:34:01.584 --> 01:34:04.504
Careful. We're making a fire.
It's freezing.

01:34:04.587 --> 01:34:07.173
Come on, Frankie,
give us a hand, will you?

01:34:07.257 --> 01:34:09.676
Oh! Yay!

01:34:09.717 --> 01:34:12.720
Take the Pope, Michael.

01:34:12.804 --> 01:34:14.764
Here, put the Pope on the bed.

01:34:41.833 --> 01:34:45.503
- Is that you, Frankie?
- 'Tis, Mrs. Purcell.

01:34:45.545 --> 01:34:47.589
Come on in out of the cold, son.

01:34:50.383 --> 01:34:53.261
Holy blessed God,
you're freezing with the cold, boy.

01:35:03.104 --> 01:35:06.524
Isn't it grand, the radio, Frankie?

01:35:06.566 --> 01:35:09.277
'Tis, Mrs. Purcell.

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:12.530
Do you see Bedouins in the Sahara...

01:35:12.614 --> 01:35:15.909
and the cowboys on the prairie?

01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:17.911
I do.

01:35:17.952 --> 01:35:20.121
And people sipping wine in cafes.

01:35:20.204 --> 01:35:23.875
And sailors in their galleons
sipping their cocoa.

01:35:23.958 --> 01:35:28.171
And plays about the Greeks, where they
have to pluck out their eyes...

01:35:28.254 --> 01:35:30.840
because they married
their mothers by mistake.

01:35:30.924 --> 01:35:34.427
And the Shakespeare.
I love the Shakespeare.

01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:37.263
Shakespeare is like mashed potatoes,
Mrs. Purcell.

01:35:37.347 --> 01:35:39.390
You can'tget enough of them.

01:35:39.432 --> 01:35:44.228
I'm sure Mr. Shakespeare
must have been an Irishman.

01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:48.483
If you want the things you love

01:35:48.566 --> 01:35:51.736
You must have showers

01:35:51.778 --> 01:35:55.281
Ah, Billie Holiday.

01:35:57.075 --> 01:35:59.827
Oh, Billie, Billie.

01:35:59.911 --> 01:36:01.955
I want to be with you in America.

01:36:02.038 --> 01:36:03.957
There'll be pennies from heaven

01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:06.626
For you andme

01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:09.462
Oh, America.

01:36:09.545 --> 01:36:12.048
Where no one has bad teeth
and everyone has a lavatory.

01:36:21.849 --> 01:36:24.769
Great God in heaven,
where's the other room?

01:36:24.811 --> 01:36:26.771
What room?

01:36:26.813 --> 01:36:28.981
I rented you two rooms
up here, and one is gone.

01:36:29.065 --> 01:36:32.318
I distinctly remember a wall
because I distinctly remember a room.

01:36:32.402 --> 01:36:35.113
- Where's that room gone?
- I don't remember a wall.

01:36:35.196 --> 01:36:38.533
And if I don't remember a wall,
I can't remember a room.

01:36:38.616 --> 01:36:41.661
I want to know where that wall is
and what she did with that room!

01:36:41.744 --> 01:36:44.664
Do any of you remember a wall?

01:36:44.706 --> 01:36:47.291
Is that the wall we burned in the fire?

01:36:47.375 --> 01:36:50.044
Dear God. This takes the bloody biscuit.

01:36:50.128 --> 01:36:54.340
It's four weeks behind
in the rent you are, and now this.

01:36:54.424 --> 01:36:56.551
Out, missus. I'm putting you out.

01:36:56.634 --> 01:36:58.553
One week from today,
I'll knock on this door,

01:36:58.636 --> 01:37:00.722
and I want to find nobody home.

01:37:00.805 --> 01:37:04.183
Everybody out. Never to return.

01:37:04.267 --> 01:37:06.894
'Tis a pity you weren't alive
when the English...

01:37:06.978 --> 01:37:09.480
were evicting us
and leaving us on the road.

01:37:09.522 --> 01:37:12.984
No lip from you, missus, or I'll send
the men to put you out tomorrow.

01:37:13.025 --> 01:37:17.238
It's out on the pavement you'll be
with the sky peeing on your furniture.

01:37:22.827 --> 01:37:25.746
Oh, dear God in heaven,
what am I going to do?

01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:28.708
Your cousin, Laman Griffin,
is living on the Rosbrien Road...

01:37:28.791 --> 01:37:30.710
in that little house of his mother's.

01:37:30.793 --> 01:37:33.212
He'll surely take you in
till better times come.

01:37:33.254 --> 01:37:35.256
I'll go and see him now.

01:37:35.339 --> 01:37:38.217
Frankie, come with me.
And put your mac on.

01:37:38.301 --> 01:37:40.428
I haven't got a mac.

01:37:40.511 --> 01:37:42.889
Jesus, what a family.

01:37:49.770 --> 01:37:52.023
Grandma caught a chill that day,

01:37:52.064 --> 01:37:55.026
and the chill turned to pneumonia.

01:37:55.067 --> 01:37:57.236
They shifted her
to the City Home Hospital,

01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:00.281
and when she died,
Mam said that herfamily...

01:38:00.364 --> 01:38:03.659
was disappearing before her very eyes.

01:38:14.212 --> 01:38:17.006
- Frankie, will you shut the door?
- Let's go.

01:38:17.089 --> 01:38:19.550
- Right. Let's go.
- Malachy, the wheel's all bockety.

01:38:19.592 --> 01:38:22.094
- Kaiser Bill marched over the hill
- Shut up, will you?

01:38:22.136 --> 01:38:24.931
To fight the British Army

01:38:25.014 --> 01:38:29.310
They're all going to know
we got the eviction. Will you be quiet?

01:38:35.775 --> 01:38:39.153
And so Malachy, Michael, Mam, and me...

01:38:39.237 --> 01:38:44.116
moved into mom's cousin's-
Laman Griffin- on the Rosbrien Road.

01:38:47.662 --> 01:38:50.831
- Did you get the library books?
- I did.

01:38:50.915 --> 01:38:54.502
Go in the yard and see if there's
something else to go on this fire.

01:38:54.585 --> 01:38:58.005
- Is that for us?
- No, his lordship upstairs.

01:38:58.089 --> 01:39:01.258
Why ask? It was the same every week-

01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:03.970
one steak, four potatoes, an onion,
and a bottle of stout.

01:39:04.053 --> 01:39:06.472
Frankie, are you back?

01:39:06.514 --> 01:39:08.474
Will you take up the books?

01:39:17.566 --> 01:39:19.777
Good boy, Frankie.
Put them on the bed there.

01:39:19.819 --> 01:39:21.821
Angela, the chamber pot is full.

01:39:21.862 --> 01:39:24.657
Is there anything else
your lordship would like?

01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:27.159
Woman's work, Angela.
Woman's work and free rent.

01:39:27.159 --> 01:39:29.495
- I'll empty it.
- You will?

01:39:29.578 --> 01:39:33.416
Okay, Frankie. Take it outside
and rinse it under the tap.

01:39:33.499 --> 01:39:35.710
And from now on, that will be your job.

01:40:10.035 --> 01:40:14.206
America, wonderfull and of the Arapaho,

01:40:14.248 --> 01:40:16.751
Cheyenne, Chippewa,

01:40:16.834 --> 01:40:20.838
Sioux, Apache, Iroquois.

01:40:20.921 --> 01:40:24.550
Poetry, boys. And the chiefs! Listen.

01:40:24.592 --> 01:40:27.219
Kicking Bear, Rain-in-the-Face,

01:40:27.303 --> 01:40:29.388
Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse,

01:40:29.472 --> 01:40:31.599
and the man himself,

01:40:31.682 --> 01:40:34.685
the genius Geronimo.

01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:41.442
Stock your minds, boys,
and you can move through the world...

01:40:41.484 --> 01:40:43.736
resplendent.

01:40:43.777 --> 01:40:46.906
Clarke, define "resplendent."

01:40:46.989 --> 01:40:50.826
- I think it's shining, sir.
- Pithy but adequate.

01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:53.537
McCourt, give us a sentence with "pithy."

01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:58.792
Clarke is pithy but adequate, sir.

01:40:58.876 --> 01:41:01.086
Adroit, McCourt.

01:41:01.170 --> 01:41:04.757
You have a mind for the priesthood,
my boy, or politics.

01:41:06.592 --> 01:41:09.094
Tell you mother to come and see me.

01:41:09.136 --> 01:41:11.138
Hoppy O'Halloran told Mam...

01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:13.140
to take me to the Christian Brothers-

01:41:13.224 --> 01:41:16.477
to say he sent me,
and I was a bright boy...

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:18.479
and ought to be going
to secondary school...

01:41:18.562 --> 01:41:20.606
and maybe to university even.

01:41:20.648 --> 01:41:22.733
I wish he'd mind his own business.

01:41:22.816 --> 01:41:24.860
I want to quit school forever and get
a job with wages every Friday night...

01:41:24.902 --> 01:41:26.904
I want to quit school forever and get
a job with wages every Friday night...

01:41:26.987 --> 01:41:30.699
and go to the pictures
every Saturday like everybody else.

01:41:30.783 --> 01:41:32.743
I've come to see Brother Murray.

01:41:32.826 --> 01:41:34.870
I don't know why we bothered.
They took one look at us...

01:41:34.954 --> 01:41:39.458
- What do you want?
- This is my son Frank.

01:41:39.541 --> 01:41:42.211
And said no.

01:41:45.005 --> 01:41:47.216
Francis, will you listen to me?

01:41:47.258 --> 01:41:49.260
Are you listening?

01:41:49.343 --> 01:41:51.262
I am.

01:41:51.345 --> 01:41:54.265
You're never to let anybody slam
the door in your face again.

01:41:54.348 --> 01:41:56.392
Do you hear me?

01:41:56.475 --> 01:41:58.435
I do.

01:41:59.853 --> 01:42:04.733
Impurity. I say again, impurity.

01:42:04.817 --> 01:42:08.529
Impurity is so grave a sin...

01:42:09.947 --> 01:42:13.117
the Virgin Maryturns
her face away and weeps.

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:16.286
She weeps when she looks down...

01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:18.330
that long, dreary vista of time...

01:42:18.414 --> 01:42:22.584
and beholds in horror
the spectacle of Limerick boys...

01:42:22.668 --> 01:42:26.755
defiling themselves, polluting themselves,

01:42:26.839 --> 01:42:31.301
soiling their young bodies
which are the temple of the Holy Ghost.

01:42:31.385 --> 01:42:34.263
Interfering with themselves.

01:42:34.346 --> 01:42:37.808
We pray to the Virgin Mary
to say we're sorry...

01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:41.603
because we can't stop
interfering with ourselves.

01:42:41.687 --> 01:42:44.064
- The dong!
- The dong!

01:42:44.148 --> 01:42:46.358
- The prick!
- The prick!

01:42:46.442 --> 01:42:49.403
- The dick!
- The dick!

01:42:49.486 --> 01:42:51.405
- The langer!
- The langer!

01:42:51.488 --> 01:42:53.615
- The excitement!
- The excitement!

01:42:53.699 --> 01:42:57.828
- The excitement?
- Yeah, the excitement.

01:42:57.911 --> 01:43:00.789
Yeah, I heard of that.

01:43:04.835 --> 01:43:08.881
Paddy Clohessy found
a priest to confess our hideous sins to.

01:43:08.964 --> 01:43:13.844
He's 90 years old and deaf as a turnip.

01:43:13.927 --> 01:43:15.846
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:43:15.929 --> 01:43:19.933
It's been ages since me last confession.
I've been masturbating.

01:43:20.017 --> 01:43:22.561
Except one day,
he died and didn't tell us.

01:43:22.644 --> 01:43:25.397
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:43:25.481 --> 01:43:28.066
It's been a fort-

01:43:28.150 --> 01:43:32.821
It's been a fortnight
since my last confession.

01:43:32.863 --> 01:43:35.199
And what have you done
since then, my child?

01:43:35.282 --> 01:43:40.245
I, uh, I hit my brother.

01:43:40.329 --> 01:43:42.247
I lied to my mother.

01:43:42.331 --> 01:43:44.875
Yes, my child. And what else?

01:43:46.418 --> 01:43:50.130
Uh, I did dirty things, Father.

01:43:50.214 --> 01:43:54.927
Ah, mychild, was that with yourself
or with another?

01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:57.054
Or with some class of beast?

01:43:57.137 --> 01:44:00.724
Beast?

01:44:00.807 --> 01:44:03.352
I never heard ofa sin like that, Father.

01:44:03.435 --> 01:44:05.562
This priest must be from the country.

01:44:05.646 --> 01:44:08.148
He's opening up new worlds for me.

01:44:24.748 --> 01:44:27.376
I'll just take him up his last mug of tea.

01:45:02.202 --> 01:45:04.121
It's a disgrace...

01:45:04.204 --> 01:45:06.623
that boys like McCourt...

01:45:06.707 --> 01:45:09.793
and Clarke and Kennedy...

01:45:09.876 --> 01:45:14.715
have to hew wood and draw water...

01:45:14.798 --> 01:45:18.969
in this so-called free
and independent Ireland...

01:45:19.052 --> 01:45:23.932
that keeps a class system
foisted on us by the English.

01:45:24.016 --> 01:45:26.852
Well, it disgusts me.

01:45:26.935 --> 01:45:30.605
We throw our talented children
onto the dung heap.

01:45:30.689 --> 01:45:33.275
If this is the end of school for you,

01:45:33.358 --> 01:45:37.654
you must get out of this country,
boys, and go to America.

01:45:39.406 --> 01:45:42.075
McCourt, do you hear me?

01:45:42.159 --> 01:45:43.994
I do, sir.

01:45:45.579 --> 01:45:49.249
Laman Griffin was drunk every night.

01:45:49.332 --> 01:45:52.669
Worst still was Fridays when we had
to watch him eat his fish and chips.

01:45:52.753 --> 01:45:54.963
Woman, boil some water for tea.

01:45:55.047 --> 01:45:58.008
We've no coal or turf.

01:45:58.050 --> 01:46:00.010
You useless great lump,

01:46:00.052 --> 01:46:02.637
living free under me roof
with you snotty-nosed pack of brats.

01:46:02.721 --> 01:46:05.265
You.

01:46:05.348 --> 01:46:08.518
Go to the shop for a few sods
and some kindling.

01:46:08.602 --> 01:46:11.730
Come on. Or are you as useless
as your mother?

01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:15.859
Did you empty the chamber pot today?

01:46:15.942 --> 01:46:18.487
Shite. I left it on the stairs.

01:46:18.570 --> 01:46:21.740
You stand there with your thick gob
and tell me you didn't do it?

01:46:21.823 --> 01:46:25.660
I'm sorry. I forgot. I'll do it now.

01:46:25.744 --> 01:46:29.122
- He couldn't do it.
- Shut up, woman.

01:46:29.206 --> 01:46:31.625
It was his last day at school,
and he had to go to the doctor.

01:46:31.708 --> 01:46:33.502
I said, shut up, woman!

01:46:33.585 --> 01:46:35.587
You can't tell us to shut up.
You're not our father!

01:46:35.670 --> 01:46:40.258
If I have to get up from this table,
you'll be calling for your patron saint.

01:46:40.342 --> 01:46:42.677
Shut your gob.

01:46:42.761 --> 01:46:45.305
I'll kill you!

01:46:45.388 --> 01:46:48.683
- You're not my father!
- Stop it!

01:46:48.767 --> 01:46:51.686
Leave him alone, sweet Jesus. Stop it!

01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:54.981
He doesn't mean any harm.
He's only a child.

01:46:55.065 --> 01:46:57.108
And he's to start work
at the post office on Monday.

01:46:57.192 --> 01:46:59.110
Give me a fag, woman.

01:46:59.194 --> 01:47:01.863
I'm telling you,
that boy is a little shite.

01:47:01.947 --> 01:47:03.990
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

01:47:04.074 --> 01:47:05.992
I'm going to bed.

01:47:10.497 --> 01:47:13.124
I heard them talking.

01:47:13.208 --> 01:47:16.586
I heard the sound of Laman's boots
as he scraped his way to bed.

01:47:16.628 --> 01:47:18.922
I thought Mam would come
and kiss me goodnight,

01:47:19.005 --> 01:47:22.801
to say thank you for sticking up for her.

01:47:24.469 --> 01:47:27.222
But no. She went to him.

01:47:55.458 --> 01:47:57.919
Where are you going, Frankie?

01:47:58.003 --> 01:47:59.921
I'm leaving.

01:48:00.005 --> 01:48:01.923
Why are you leaving, Frankie?

01:48:02.007 --> 01:48:06.136
Because if I stay,
I'll take a knife to his neck.

01:48:06.219 --> 01:48:08.972
Will you kill him?

01:48:09.055 --> 01:48:11.224
Go to sleep, Malachy.

01:49:13.953 --> 01:49:16.706
You're not having my chips.

01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:21.544
I just wanted to stay
the night, Uncle Pat.

01:49:21.586 --> 01:49:24.005
All right.

01:49:24.089 --> 01:49:26.758
You can stay in me mother's bed.

01:49:26.841 --> 01:49:29.552
- Don't expect me to feed you, though.
- I won't.

01:49:29.677 --> 01:49:33.098
There's not a scrap of food in the house.

01:49:37.268 --> 01:49:39.562
What happened to your face?

01:49:39.646 --> 01:49:42.190
It's all swole.

01:49:42.273 --> 01:49:45.985
Did someone punch you?

01:49:46.069 --> 01:49:48.112
Yeah.

01:49:48.196 --> 01:49:50.740
Who was punching you?

01:49:50.824 --> 01:49:53.243
Joe Louis.

01:49:53.326 --> 01:49:55.203
Joe Louis?

01:49:58.289 --> 01:50:00.375
I thought he lived in America.

01:50:00.458 --> 01:50:02.710
Was he visiting Limerick?

01:50:02.794 --> 01:50:04.754
He was, Uncle Pat.

01:50:04.796 --> 01:50:08.758
That's not right, him hitting a wee boy...

01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:11.177
and him being heavyweight champion
of America and all.

01:50:11.261 --> 01:50:14.097
The world champion he is, Uncle Pat.

01:50:14.138 --> 01:50:16.975
That's worse.

01:50:17.058 --> 01:50:19.227
And look at you, so skinny.

01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:21.771
Those arms wouldn't lift two stamps.

01:50:23.606 --> 01:50:27.193
Some things is most peculiar, Frankie.

01:50:29.195 --> 01:50:31.114
I'm off to bed.

01:50:44.085 --> 01:50:46.129
I was so hungry.

01:50:46.212 --> 01:50:49.424
I sat there and licked the front page
and all the headlines.

01:50:49.507 --> 01:50:54.304
I licked the great attacks
of Patton and Montgomery.

01:50:54.345 --> 01:50:56.055
I licked the sports pages.

01:50:56.139 --> 01:50:58.641
I licked the market prices
of eggs and butter and bacon.

01:50:58.725 --> 01:51:03.062
I sucked that paper until my face was
as black as Al Jolson's.

01:51:06.316 --> 01:51:08.735
Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy.

01:51:41.017 --> 01:51:42.935
Let's go, Patty.

01:51:45.021 --> 01:51:48.441
We have to get you- Up you go.

01:51:48.524 --> 01:51:50.693
Come on, Pat, up the steps.

01:51:50.777 --> 01:51:52.737
How did you let him get this drunk?

01:51:52.779 --> 01:51:54.739
Drink never hurt anyone, did it?

01:51:54.781 --> 01:51:57.909
- I want a drink.
- Tomorrow.

01:51:57.992 --> 01:51:59.911
- Push him, Pa.
- I'm pushing. I'm pushing.

01:51:59.994 --> 01:52:02.246
Come on, Pat.

01:52:02.330 --> 01:52:06.417
Christ, you're taking
both sides of the room.

01:52:09.128 --> 01:52:11.672
What are you doing
in this house, in that bed?

01:52:11.756 --> 01:52:14.425
Get up and put the kettle
on for your poor Uncle Pat...

01:52:14.509 --> 01:52:16.594
that fell down the worse for drink.

01:52:19.222 --> 01:52:22.391
Mother of God!

01:52:22.475 --> 01:52:24.811
You're wearing me dead mother's dress.

01:52:24.894 --> 01:52:27.021
I washed my clothes for the big job.

01:52:27.105 --> 01:52:30.608
- What big job?
- Telegram boy at the post office.

01:52:30.691 --> 01:52:33.444
If the post office
are taking on the likes of you,

01:52:33.528 --> 01:52:35.988
- they must be in a desperatestate.
- Ah, Frankie.

01:52:36.072 --> 01:52:38.616
You look... gorgeous.

01:52:38.699 --> 01:52:41.661
Jesus, what did you wash these in?

01:52:41.744 --> 01:52:45.206
- Carbolic soap.
- They smell like dead pigeons!

01:52:45.289 --> 01:52:47.625
You'll make a show of us.

01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:59.470
What time do you have to be at that job?

01:52:59.512 --> 01:53:01.472
9:00.

01:53:01.514 --> 01:53:04.767
Tell them that your aunt was waiting
for you and that's why you're late.

01:53:04.809 --> 01:53:06.894
Late? Why do I have to be late?

01:53:06.978 --> 01:53:10.773
Just shut up and do what
you're bloody well told.

01:53:11.983 --> 01:53:15.111
Mmm. That's more like it.

01:53:15.194 --> 01:53:18.155
I often wondered
why Aunt Aggie was always so angry.

01:53:18.239 --> 01:53:20.157
But you're going to need a new shirt.

01:53:20.241 --> 01:53:22.285
And shoes, not boots. Shoes.

01:53:22.326 --> 01:53:25.037
Compared to Mam, she had everything,

01:53:25.121 --> 01:53:27.331
and she didn't have any kids
to keep her poor.

01:53:27.415 --> 01:53:30.960
And here she is buying me clothes
for my new job.

01:53:31.043 --> 01:53:33.504
That's grand.

01:53:33.588 --> 01:53:36.132
Here's two shillings
to get tea and a bun for your birthday.

01:53:38.634 --> 01:53:41.846
You look so smart,
people will think you've robbed a bank.

01:53:51.314 --> 01:53:55.359
She certainly
was a mystery, my Aunt Aggie.

01:53:55.443 --> 01:53:57.778
A complete mystery.

01:54:07.496 --> 01:54:11.500
We know every avenue, road, street...

01:54:11.584 --> 01:54:15.421
terrace, mews, place, close and lane.

01:54:15.504 --> 01:54:18.007
You don't have to have a hanker

01:54:18.090 --> 01:54:20.885
To be a broker or banker

01:54:20.968 --> 01:54:25.056
No, sirree, just simply be
my mother's son-in-law

01:54:25.139 --> 01:54:27.558
Needn't even think of tryin'

01:54:27.642 --> 01:54:29.977
To be a mighty social lion

01:54:30.061 --> 01:54:34.315
Sippin' tea if you will be
my mother's son-in-law

01:54:34.398 --> 01:54:36.942
There isn't a door
in Limerick we don't know.

01:54:37.026 --> 01:54:40.071
We knock on all kinds of doors-
iron, oak, plywood.

01:54:40.154 --> 01:54:44.742
Twenty thousand doors. We knock,
kick, push. We ring and buzz bells.

01:54:46.744 --> 01:54:49.580
Risking life and limb
as we fight off everydog...

01:54:49.622 --> 01:54:52.249
who wants to turn us into dinner.

01:54:52.333 --> 01:54:55.503
There are telegrams
for the houses of priests.

01:54:55.586 --> 01:54:56.837
God bless you.

01:54:56.921 --> 01:54:59.590
But if you waited for tips
from nuns and priests,

01:54:59.673 --> 01:55:02.385
you'd surely die on their doorsteps.

01:55:02.551 --> 01:55:04.011
You're lucky to get the Carmody telegram.

01:55:04.095 --> 01:55:05.137
I am?

01:55:05.221 --> 01:55:07.139
They're big tippers.
You'll get a shilling.

01:55:07.223 --> 01:55:09.141
How come I got the telegram?

01:55:09.225 --> 01:55:11.268
- 'Cause nobody else will go there.
- Why?

01:55:11.352 --> 01:55:13.604
'Cause Theresa Carmody's
got the consumption.

01:55:19.819 --> 01:55:23.030
You don't have to speak like that so

01:55:23.114 --> 01:55:25.408
You can tell the world I said so

01:55:25.449 --> 01:55:30.121
Can't you see you got to be
my mother's son-in-law

01:55:37.461 --> 01:55:40.131
I heard that sick people like Theresa...

01:55:40.214 --> 01:55:42.133
know that they haven't got long to live...

01:55:42.216 --> 01:55:46.137
and so it makes them mad
for love and romance...

01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:48.264
and dirty things ingeneral.

01:55:48.347 --> 01:55:51.767
- Telegram.
- That's what they say, anyway.

01:55:51.809 --> 01:55:56.730
- You're all wet and bleeding.
- I skidded on me bike.

01:55:56.814 --> 01:56:00.025
Come in. I'll put something on your cuts.

01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:02.611
I wonder should I go in.

01:56:02.653 --> 01:56:04.655
I might get the consumption.

01:56:04.738 --> 01:56:07.449
That'll be the end of me,
and I'll never get to America.

01:56:07.533 --> 01:56:11.579
- Come in. You'll perish standing there.
- I need the shilling tip.

01:56:22.089 --> 01:56:24.425
Oh, you big poltroon.

01:56:26.510 --> 01:56:29.763
Now that's better.

01:56:29.847 --> 01:56:33.976
Why don't you take off your clothes
and dry them on the screen there?

01:56:34.059 --> 01:56:36.020
Uh, no.

01:56:36.061 --> 01:56:37.771
Ah, do.

01:56:37.855 --> 01:56:40.733
I will.

01:57:04.381 --> 01:57:07.343
Lord, you might be scrawny,

01:57:07.426 --> 01:57:09.970
but that's a fine boyo you have there.

01:57:10.137 --> 01:57:14.350
My head is full
of sin and fear of consumption.

01:57:14.433 --> 01:57:16.352
Her green eyes...

01:57:16.435 --> 01:57:19.480
and my shilling tip.

01:57:19.563 --> 01:57:22.983
And she's on top of me,
and I might be killing myself...

01:57:23.025 --> 01:57:25.235
catching consumption from her mouth.

01:57:25.319 --> 01:57:27.613
I'm riding to heaven.
I'm falling off a cliff.

01:57:27.655 --> 01:57:30.824
And if this is a sin,
I don't give a fiddler's fart.

01:57:35.079 --> 01:57:37.164
Fuck off, you bollocks!

01:57:39.875 --> 01:57:43.170
Your mouth is a lavatory, McCourt.
Did you hear me?

01:57:43.212 --> 01:57:46.423
- I did, Miss Barry.
- You've been heard on the stairs.

01:57:46.507 --> 01:57:49.468
- Yes, Miss Barry.
- Shut up, McCourt.

01:57:49.551 --> 01:57:52.221
- I will, Miss Barry.
- Not another word, McCourt.

01:57:52.304 --> 01:57:54.515
- No, Miss Barry.
- I said shut up, McCourt.

01:57:54.556 --> 01:57:56.225
All right, Miss Barry.

01:57:56.308 --> 01:57:59.937
That's the end of it,
McCourt. Don't try me.

01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:01.689
I- I won't, Miss Barry.

01:58:01.730 --> 01:58:04.942
- Mother of God, give me patience!
- Yes, Miss Barry.

01:58:08.570 --> 01:58:10.572
Take the last word, McCourt.

01:58:10.656 --> 01:58:13.450
Take it. Take it. Take it!

01:58:18.747 --> 01:58:21.291
I will, Miss Barry.

01:58:41.437 --> 01:58:43.772
What do you want most in the world?

01:58:45.274 --> 01:58:47.234
To go to America.

01:58:48.944 --> 01:58:51.071
What do you want most?

01:58:51.155 --> 01:58:54.658
Oh, to fall in love
with some gorgeous man.

01:58:54.741 --> 01:58:58.036
Oh, hold me, Frankie.

01:59:20.976 --> 01:59:22.811
Uncle Pat?

01:59:26.732 --> 01:59:29.318
Hello, Frankie.

01:59:39.369 --> 01:59:41.580
How's the job?

01:59:41.663 --> 01:59:44.750
Grand.

01:59:44.833 --> 01:59:46.960
Uncle Pat lookin' after you?

01:59:47.002 --> 01:59:48.962
He is.

01:59:49.004 --> 01:59:51.673
But I can look after meself.

01:59:53.383 --> 01:59:55.344
That's good.

01:59:55.427 --> 01:59:59.056
- You're getting enough to eat, I see.
- Lam.

01:59:59.139 --> 02:00:01.141
Would you like a chip?

02:00:01.183 --> 02:00:03.560
No.

02:00:08.690 --> 02:00:11.526
Michael and little Alphie are fine.

02:00:11.610 --> 02:00:13.612
That's good.

02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:17.199
We all miss Malachy. He's, uh-

02:00:17.282 --> 02:00:20.619
- Miss him? He-
- He's gone to join the army band!

02:00:20.702 --> 02:00:23.664
- Playin' the bugle.
- The bugle?

02:00:23.705 --> 02:00:26.500
Can you imagine that, playin' the bugle?
Playin' the fool, more like.

02:00:26.541 --> 02:00:31.338
That's Malachy, all right.

02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:33.465
Mad Malachy.

02:00:41.682 --> 02:00:45.018
I miss him too.

02:01:14.589 --> 02:01:17.300
- Telegram, Mrs. Carmody.
- Thank you.

02:01:17.384 --> 02:01:21.388
I usually deliver the telegram
to your daughter.

02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:24.099
- Theresa, isn't it?
- Theresa's in the sanatorium.

02:01:43.285 --> 02:01:47.414
Please, God, it wasn't Theresa's fault.

02:01:47.497 --> 02:01:51.626
The excitement on the sofa
is what the consumption does to you.

02:01:51.710 --> 02:01:53.753
I love her, God,

02:01:53.795 --> 02:01:57.716
just like St. Francis loved
any bird or beast or fish.

02:01:57.799 --> 02:02:00.635
Please, God, take the consumption away,

02:02:00.677 --> 02:02:03.013
and I promise I'll never
go near her again.

02:02:19.279 --> 02:02:22.866
Anima eius, et animae
omnium fidelium defunctorum,

02:02:22.949 --> 02:02:27.329
per misericordiam Dei,
requiescant in pacem.

02:02:28.413 --> 02:02:30.582
Amen.

02:02:35.003 --> 02:02:38.089
I want to tell
the priest and Theresa's mam and dad...

02:02:38.173 --> 02:02:41.343
that it was me, Frank McCourt,
the dirty rotten thing...

02:02:41.426 --> 02:02:43.637
that sent Theresa straight to hell.

02:02:46.181 --> 02:02:49.809
I think of Theresa, cold in her coffin,

02:02:49.851 --> 02:02:52.312
the red hair, the green eyes.

02:02:54.147 --> 02:02:56.107
I can't understand what I feel,

02:02:56.191 --> 02:03:00.153
but I know that with all the people
who died in my family...

02:03:00.195 --> 02:03:03.198
and all the people who died
in the lanes around me,

02:03:03.281 --> 02:03:06.159
I never had a pain like this in my heart,

02:03:06.201 --> 02:03:08.495
and I hope Inever will again.

02:03:13.041 --> 02:03:15.877
And then, as luck would have it,
I had to deliver a telegram...

02:03:15.961 --> 02:03:18.046
to the moneylender, Mrs. Finucane,

02:03:18.129 --> 02:03:21.049
and St. Francis
smiled down on me once more.

02:03:29.849 --> 02:03:32.102
How old are you, boy?

02:03:32.185 --> 02:03:34.604
Fifteen and some, missus.

02:03:34.688 --> 02:03:36.773
Old enough and ugly enough.

02:03:36.856 --> 02:03:38.775
Yes, missus.

02:03:38.858 --> 02:03:41.444
But are you smart, boy?
Are you in any way intelligent?

02:03:42.570 --> 02:03:44.531
I can read and write, Mrs. Finucane.

02:03:44.614 --> 02:03:46.866
There are people in the lunatic asylum
can read and write.

02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:49.661
- Can you write a letter?
- I can, Mrs. Finucane.

02:03:49.744 --> 02:03:52.706
I'll give you three pence
for every letter you write,

02:03:52.789 --> 02:03:54.791
and three pence if it brings in a payment.

02:03:54.874 --> 02:03:58.920
Come on Thursday. Bring your own paper
and envelopes with you.

02:04:02.090 --> 02:04:05.301
"O'Brien, Donnolley, Meagher, Hannon,

02:04:05.385 --> 02:04:07.929
old Mrs. Keneally, Mulcahy, Ahern."

02:04:07.971 --> 02:04:10.640
We'll see how you do
with that lot for a start.

02:04:10.724 --> 02:04:14.561
Threaten them, boy.
Threaten the life out of them.

02:04:15.770 --> 02:04:18.022
How does this sound?

02:04:18.106 --> 02:04:20.024
"Dear Mrs. O'Brien:

02:04:20.108 --> 02:04:24.279
In as much as you have not seen fit
to pay me what you owe me,

02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:26.740
I may be forced to resort to legal action.

02:04:26.823 --> 02:04:31.745
There's your son, Michael, parading
around the world in his new suit,

02:04:31.828 --> 02:04:33.663
which I paid for,

02:04:33.747 --> 02:04:38.293
while I myself have barely a crust
to keep body and soul together."

02:04:38.376 --> 02:04:42.797
"I am sure you don't want to languish
in the dungeons of Limerick jail,

02:04:42.839 --> 02:04:44.966
far from friends and family.

02:04:45.049 --> 02:04:48.344
I remain yours in lit- lit-"

02:04:48.428 --> 02:04:51.473
- What are these words, boy?
- Litigious anticipation.

02:04:52.849 --> 02:04:54.809
That's a powerful letter.

02:04:56.186 --> 02:04:59.355
This word, "in as much."

02:04:59.439 --> 02:05:02.650
That's a holy terror of a word.
What does it mean?

02:05:02.692 --> 02:05:05.778
It means, "this is your last chance."

02:05:07.739 --> 02:05:10.158
She gives me money for stamps,

02:05:10.241 --> 02:05:13.244
but I deliver the letters myself
and keep the money.

02:05:35.099 --> 02:05:39.938
What class of a demon would torment
her own kind with a letter like that?

02:05:39.979 --> 02:05:43.691
It's truly awful.

02:05:43.775 --> 02:05:45.360
What's up with Mrs. Hannon?

02:05:45.443 --> 02:05:48.613
That old bitch Finucane sent her
a threatening letter. Look.

02:05:48.696 --> 02:05:51.282
People who write letters
like that should be boiled in oil...

02:05:51.366 --> 02:05:54.244
and then have their fingernails
pulled out by blind people.

02:05:56.621 --> 02:05:58.623
That's great.
Thanks very much. Next, please.

02:06:00.166 --> 02:06:02.210
I'm sorry for their troubles,

02:06:02.293 --> 02:06:05.922
but there's no other way for me to save
the money for the trip to America.

02:06:09.050 --> 02:06:11.594
If the whole of Ireland
was dying of hunger,

02:06:11.678 --> 02:06:14.555
I wouldn't touch this money
in the post office.

02:06:14.681 --> 02:06:18.142
Thanks, John. Listen here to me, men.

02:06:18.226 --> 02:06:20.144
Listen a second.

02:06:20.186 --> 02:06:23.106
This is my nephew here, Frankie McCourt,
the son of Angela Sheehan,

02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:25.108
the sister of my wife,
having his first pint.

02:06:25.191 --> 02:06:27.527
Here's to your health
and long life, Frankie.

02:06:27.568 --> 02:06:30.905
May you live to enjoy the pint,
but not too much, eh?

02:06:36.869 --> 02:06:39.497
Slow down, slow down.

02:06:39.539 --> 02:06:42.166
Don't drink it all at once.

02:06:42.250 --> 02:06:48.006
In Mountjoy jail one Monday morning

02:06:48.089 --> 02:06:53.052
High upon the gallows tree

02:06:53.136 --> 02:06:58.016
Kevin Barry gave his young life

02:06:58.057 --> 02:07:02.437
For the cause of liberty

02:07:05.565 --> 02:07:10.903
Just a lad of 18 summers

02:07:10.945 --> 02:07:13.614
And no-

02:07:22.248 --> 02:07:25.209
What kind of state
is that to come home in?

02:07:29.589 --> 02:07:31.591
Up, boys, up!

02:07:31.674 --> 02:07:34.093
The Red Branch Knights!

02:07:34.135 --> 02:07:36.596
The Fenian men!

02:07:36.637 --> 02:07:38.890
The glorious I.R.A.!

02:07:38.931 --> 02:07:41.726
I can't believe you.
It's your father you've become.

02:07:41.768 --> 02:07:43.811
Tonight-

02:07:47.482 --> 02:07:49.442
Tonight, I had me first pint.

02:07:49.484 --> 02:07:52.195
You should be ashamed of yourself.

02:07:52.278 --> 02:07:54.572
My first pint with Uncle Pa.

02:07:54.614 --> 02:07:56.699
Uncle Pa should know better.

02:07:56.783 --> 02:08:00.203
No father around to get me my first pint.

02:08:00.286 --> 02:08:02.997
Your father was no good
to anyone, and neither are you.

02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:05.082
You're just like him, you drunken feck!

02:08:05.166 --> 02:08:10.505
I'd rather be like my father
than like your Laman Griffin!

02:08:10.588 --> 02:08:12.882
Mind your tongue. You're drunk.

02:08:12.965 --> 02:08:16.344
Mind your own tongue.

02:08:16.427 --> 02:08:19.055
You and Laman Griffin!

02:08:20.473 --> 02:08:23.601
You slut!

02:08:23.643 --> 02:08:26.312
You've a mouth on you worse than
your drunken eejit father!

02:08:26.395 --> 02:08:29.440
Better to be like
my drunken eejit father than like...

02:08:29.524 --> 02:08:32.985
that fat, disgustin' shite Laman Griffin,

02:08:33.027 --> 02:08:35.446
who you crept up to every night
there back at Rosbrien!

02:08:35.488 --> 02:08:39.033
- Shut up!
- Laman Griffin. Laman Griffin.

02:08:39.116 --> 02:08:41.702
Up in the loft with Laman Griffin!

02:08:41.786 --> 02:08:43.788
Squeak, squeak, squeak,

02:08:43.829 --> 02:08:46.332
with fat Laman Griffi n
rollin' on top of you!

02:08:46.374 --> 02:08:49.502
- Shut up! Shut up!
- You fuckin' shut up, you slut!

02:09:21.492 --> 02:09:25.162
My child. Tell me what troubles you.

02:09:27.540 --> 02:09:31.168
- I'm 16 today, Father.
- Mm-hmm?

02:09:31.210 --> 02:09:34.797
- I drank my first pint last night.
- Yeah.

02:09:36.882 --> 02:09:39.218
I hit my mother.

02:09:40.886 --> 02:09:43.055
God help us.

02:09:46.392 --> 02:09:48.352
But He will forgive you.

02:09:49.603 --> 02:09:51.731
Is there anything else?

02:09:51.772 --> 02:09:53.733
I can't tell you, Father.

02:09:53.774 --> 02:09:57.111
Would you like to go to confession?

02:09:57.153 --> 02:10:00.197
I- I can't, Father.

02:10:00.281 --> 02:10:04.201
- I did terrible things.
- Well, you can tell St. Francis.

02:10:04.285 --> 02:10:06.287
You can tell St. Francis.

02:10:07.997 --> 02:10:11.834
We'll sit here, and you can tell
St. Francis...

02:10:11.917 --> 02:10:14.420
all the things that trouble you.

02:10:18.132 --> 02:10:23.429
I tell St. Francis
about Margaret, Oliver, Eugene.

02:10:24.805 --> 02:10:26.766
He treads the upper-

02:10:28.642 --> 02:10:31.395
My father singing "Kevin Barry"
and bringing home no money.

02:10:34.273 --> 02:10:37.151
My father sending no money from England.

02:10:37.234 --> 02:10:40.404
Theresa on the sofa.

02:10:40.488 --> 02:10:43.949
My terrible sins
of interfering with myself,

02:10:44.033 --> 02:10:46.118
wankin' all over Limerick and beyond.

02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:47.411
What do you want?

02:10:47.495 --> 02:10:50.456
The Christian Brother who
closed the door in my face.

02:10:51.665 --> 02:10:53.876
The tears in Mam's eyes
when I slapped her.

02:10:59.423 --> 02:11:03.344
A- A-And I give her me back
this morning, Father,

02:11:03.427 --> 02:11:07.848
even though it's me birthday
and she offered me a cup of tea.

02:11:10.726 --> 02:11:13.604
Ego te absolvo apeccatis tuis.

02:11:13.687 --> 02:11:18.025
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

02:11:18.067 --> 02:11:22.321
Say three Our Fathers,
three Hail Marys and three Glory Bes.

02:11:24.365 --> 02:11:27.451
But what about Theresa Carmody
in hell, Father?

02:11:27.535 --> 02:11:30.371
No, my child, surely she is in heaven.

02:11:30.412 --> 02:11:34.667
You don't think the sisters in the
hospital let her die without a priest?

02:11:34.708 --> 02:11:37.044
- Are you sure, Father?
- I am.

02:11:37.127 --> 02:11:39.171
God forgives you,
and you must forgive yourself.

02:11:39.213 --> 02:11:41.590
God loves you, and you must love yourself.

02:11:41.674 --> 02:11:45.844
For only when you love God and yourself
can you love all God's creatures.

02:11:58.732 --> 02:12:01.193
Thank you, St. Francis.

02:12:22.923 --> 02:12:25.426
Mrs. Finucane.

02:12:25.467 --> 02:12:27.553
It's Frank. I have your sherry.

02:13:52.471 --> 02:13:54.723
All the names are here.

02:13:54.807 --> 02:13:57.184
Me Mam. Two pounds for Christmas.

02:13:57.267 --> 02:13:59.812
Aunt Aggie. Nine pounds.

02:13:59.895 --> 02:14:01.980
Maybe for my post office clothes.

02:14:02.064 --> 02:14:05.234
Bridey Hannon forointment
for Mr. Hannon's legs.

02:14:05.317 --> 02:14:10.614
Mrs. Purcell, Clohessy, Quigley, Molloy.

02:14:10.697 --> 02:14:14.743
Everyone I know and half of the poor
of Limerick are here.

02:14:14.827 --> 02:14:18.247
They allowed the old bitch money.

02:14:18.330 --> 02:14:20.707
Well, not anymore.

02:14:39.935 --> 02:14:42.771
Not to America, not by plane.

02:14:42.855 --> 02:14:45.691
I can put you on a ship, though,

02:14:45.732 --> 02:14:48.735
that leaves Cork in a couple of weeks.
The Irish Oak.

02:14:48.819 --> 02:14:52.239
That'll cost you 55 pounds.
Do you have it?

02:14:54.241 --> 02:14:56.451
I do.

02:14:58.495 --> 02:15:02.791
And as he was leaving his mother

02:15:02.874 --> 02:15:06.753
Standing upon the quay

02:15:06.795 --> 02:15:10.632
She threw her arms around his waist

02:15:10.716 --> 02:15:14.094
- And this to him didsay
- Here you are.

02:15:14.177 --> 02:15:15.721
Everybody now.

02:15:15.762 --> 02:15:20.851
A mother's love's a blessing

02:15:20.934 --> 02:15:25.564
No matter where you roam

02:15:25.606 --> 02:15:29.359
Keep her while she's living

02:15:29.443 --> 02:15:33.780
You'll miss her when she's gone

02:15:33.822 --> 02:15:38.076
Love her as in childhood

02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:41.830
Though feeble, old and grey

02:15:41.913 --> 02:15:46.418
For you'll never miss a mother's love

02:15:46.501 --> 02:15:49.630
Till she's buried beneath the clay

02:15:49.671 --> 02:15:52.507
Fair play to you, Angela. That was mighty.

02:15:52.549 --> 02:15:55.635
Well, Frankie, your bladder must be
very close to your eye.

02:15:55.677 --> 02:15:58.221
This night is turning into
a proper wake altogether.

02:15:58.305 --> 02:15:59.348
Is there any possibility...

02:15:59.431 --> 02:16:01.975
of somebody singing something
to liven up the proceedings...

02:16:02.017 --> 02:16:03.769
before I'm driven to drink from sadness?

02:16:03.852 --> 02:16:05.771
- Oh, I forgot!
- What?

02:16:05.854 --> 02:16:07.898
The eclipse.
The moon is having an eclipse tonight.

02:16:07.981 --> 02:16:09.983
- What's an eclipse?
- Come on, all of you.

02:16:10.067 --> 02:16:12.527
We'd look a right shower of eejits
if we missed that.

02:16:22.871 --> 02:16:25.332
What's gonna happen?

02:16:25.415 --> 02:16:28.835
This is a very good sign
for you going to America, Frankie.

02:16:28.877 --> 02:16:33.840
It's a bad sign. I read that the moon
is practicing for the end of the world.

02:16:33.882 --> 02:16:36.134
End of the world, my arse.

02:16:53.652 --> 02:16:56.237
Would you look at that!

02:17:02.076 --> 02:17:05.746
- Well, isn't that somethin'?
- Wow! Isn't that grand?

02:17:07.999 --> 02:17:10.794
- It's beautiful.
- We might never see that again.

02:17:10.877 --> 02:17:13.421
Not in our life time, anyway.

02:17:17.759 --> 02:17:19.928
Was that it, then?

02:17:23.431 --> 02:17:26.143
'Tis only the beginning
for Frankie McCourt.

02:17:26.226 --> 02:17:31.189
He'll be back in a few years with a new
suit and fat on his bones like any Yank.

02:17:31.272 --> 02:17:35.192
And a lovely girl with pearly white teeth,
and her hangin' from his arm.

02:17:35.277 --> 02:17:36.945
Ah, no, Pa.

02:17:41.282 --> 02:17:44.076
Come on back inside, Angela,
and we'll have a drop of sherry.

02:17:48.415 --> 02:17:51.877
- Good luck in America, Frankie.
- Good luck to you.

02:18:15.191 --> 02:18:17.443
Good luck to ya, Frankie.
