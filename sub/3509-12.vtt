00:12.994 --> 00:14.493
Don't go in there.

00:32.293 --> 00:33.191
No!

00:41.124 --> 00:42.182
I gotta go.

00:47.393 --> 00:48.293
Me, too.

00:49.369 --> 00:50.167
Mm.

00:54.667 --> 00:56.357
I'll see you 
at the scene, sexy.

00:56.358 --> 00:57.306
Okay.

01:02.795 --> 01:04.279
Javier Esposito.
Mm-hmm.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.216
When we get to this crime scene,
do not wink at me,

01:07.217 --> 01:08.289
do not smile at me,

01:08.290 --> 01:12.303
and don't even look at me with
those puppy dog eyes. Got it?

01:13.994 --> 01:14.910
Got it.

01:17.396 --> 01:18.320
Ooh.

01:18.977 --> 01:20.251
Come on, Gina.

01:20.463 --> 01:22.369
I'm not having this
conversation with you again.

01:22.370 --> 01:24.358
Well, I'm... I gotta go.
I'm at work.

01:24.754 --> 01:26.228
It is so work.

01:27.065 --> 01:28.789
What's up, Castle? How's it going?

01:28.880 --> 01:32.403
You want my advice? Never sleep
with someone you work with.

01:33.170 --> 01:35.485
What? What do you mean?

01:35.486 --> 01:37.335
Trust me. It doesn't end well.

01:37.336 --> 01:38.428
Who knows?

01:39.529 --> 01:41.067
Everyone knows.

01:41.088 --> 01:42.464
Everyone knows what?

01:42.465 --> 01:43.428
Nothing.

01:45.311 --> 01:46.348
On my way.

01:46.516 --> 01:48.307
You okay, Castle? You seem upset.

01:48.308 --> 01:51.036
No, no, I'm fine. Why?

01:51.332 --> 01:52.214
Okay.

01:54.217 --> 01:56.545
The murder is here at
Drake's Magic Shop?

01:56.546 --> 01:57.336
Yep.

01:57.337 --> 01:59.544
I've been coming here
since I was 13 years old.

01:59.545 --> 02:02.221
This place is a
paradise for boys...

02:02.257 --> 02:05.217
Whoopee cushions,
magic tricks, fake vomit.

02:05.218 --> 02:06.970
It's not just for boys, Castle.

02:06.971 --> 02:08.745
My grandfather was
an amateur magician,

02:08.746 --> 02:11.032
and I used to come here
almost every Sunday afternoon

02:11.033 --> 02:12.846
when I was that age, too.

02:14.058 --> 02:15.966
I never pegged you
for a magic fan.

02:16.234 --> 02:17.607
You know any good tricks?

02:18.493 --> 02:19.484
I do this one thing

02:19.485 --> 02:21.096
with ice cubes.

02:22.734 --> 02:24.159
According to his
water-soaked wallet,

02:24.160 --> 02:26.817
the victim's Zalman Drake,
the shop owner.

02:26.818 --> 02:30.086
His assistant, Eliza Winter,
found him in the tank

02:30.087 --> 02:31.776
when she opened up the
store this morning.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.026
Any signs of forced entry?

02:33.027 --> 02:35.327
No. You know, it is beyond me

02:35.328 --> 02:36.874
why people think
this is entertaining.

02:36.875 --> 02:39.201
I see a guy hanging upside
down in a water tank,

02:39.202 --> 02:40.809
I think, you are a fool.

02:40.810 --> 02:44.410
Hmm. See the milk cans and
the water torture tank,

02:44.411 --> 02:46.404
they were real game
changers in the magic world.

02:46.405 --> 02:47.866
They were the first presentation

02:47.867 --> 02:50.188
of real life-and-death
consequences.

02:50.189 --> 02:53.368
As the magician held his breath,
so did the audience.

02:53.499 --> 02:55.371
Well, this magician would've
had to hold his breath

02:55.372 --> 02:57.593
eight to ten hours if
he wanted to take a bow.

02:57.594 --> 03:01.087
So you're saying between 12:00 and 2:00 A.M.?
Looks that way,

03:01.088 --> 03:04.644
petechial hemorrhaging in
his eyes indicate drowning.

03:04.906 --> 03:08.152
Failed escape attempt?
Well, there's no redness around his ankles

03:08.153 --> 03:09.054
where he was hanging.

03:09.055 --> 03:11.487
Doesn't look like he
struggled to get out.

03:11.488 --> 03:13.370
I have a feeling he was dead
before he hit the water,

03:13.371 --> 03:15.466
but I won't know for sure until
I get him back to the lab.

03:15.467 --> 03:17.387
Maybe there's another
reason he didn't struggle.

03:18.879 --> 03:20.282
Suicide note.

03:20.351 --> 03:21.622
It says he was in
financial trouble

03:21.623 --> 03:23.592
and couldn't bear the thought
of losing his family's shop,

03:23.593 --> 03:27.460
so he was gonna kill himself.
Mr. Drake did not kill himself.

03:28.527 --> 03:30.707
How do you know?
I just know.

03:30.804 --> 03:33.487
- Is it true, though? Was he gonna lose
his shop? - No.

03:33.540 --> 03:36.555
I mean, yes, but two
weeks ago, he told me

03:36.556 --> 03:37.443
that everything was fine,

03:37.444 --> 03:39.946
that he had worked it all out.
Any idea how?

03:39.947 --> 03:42.363
Was there a windfall
or an investor?

03:42.364 --> 03:43.952
He didn't say.

03:43.953 --> 03:44.518
Would he have been able

03:44.519 --> 03:47.741
to place himself in that tank?
Absolutely.

03:47.864 --> 03:50.470
But he wouldn't have.
Not Zalman.

03:50.471 --> 03:52.929
He loved and respected
magic too much.

03:54.658 --> 03:56.731
Esposito, there's
no signature here.

03:58.173 --> 04:00.404
I'll have C.S.U. run it for prints.
Have them run the tank

04:00.405 --> 04:02.811
and the entries and exits as well.
Okay.

04:03.570 --> 04:04.798
When was the last
time you saw him?

04:04.799 --> 04:07.741
Yesterday morning.
He left right after lunch,

04:07.742 --> 04:09.411
and he was gone the
rest of the day.

04:09.412 --> 04:13.092
Did he say where he was going?
Was it normal for him

04:13.093 --> 04:14.641
to leave the shop in
the middle of the day?

04:14.642 --> 04:17.238
Yeah. He would do that sometimes.

04:17.243 --> 04:19.178
Did you notice any
changes in his behavior

04:19.178 --> 04:21.928
or anything unusual
going on in his life?

04:21.930 --> 04:25.458
This past month,
he was gone m-more often.

04:25.459 --> 04:28.608
All he'd say was that he
was working on something.

04:29.084 --> 04:32.343
But he looked a little tired,
like he hadn't been sleeping.

04:32.508 --> 04:34.384
Can you think of any
reason for the change?

04:34.385 --> 04:38.272
Yes. Last month,
right before all this started,

04:38.273 --> 04:40.901
a guy came into the shop
and attacked Mr. Drake.

04:40.902 --> 04:43.214
He pushed him right
through a display case.

04:43.215 --> 04:44.653
He said he better watch his back,

04:44.654 --> 04:47.114
and he was gonna sue him
for all he was worth.

04:49.792 --> 04:51.419
Thank you. I will hold.

04:51.550 --> 04:53.206
So court records show that

04:53.207 --> 04:56.229
a lawsuit was filed against
Zalman Drake a month ago.

04:56.230 --> 04:57.938
They're pulling it up now.
Hey.

04:57.939 --> 04:59.969
Hey. We canvassed the area
around the magic shop.

04:59.970 --> 05:02.013
One of the neighbors said
she saw an old white van

05:02.014 --> 05:03.633
pull up to the shop
around midnight

05:03.634 --> 05:06.149
and then heard the gate roll up.
Okay, you guys look into that,

05:06.150 --> 05:08.151
and let's find out where
Zalman was disappearing to.

05:08.152 --> 05:09.132
I'd like to know what he was doing

05:09.133 --> 05:11.066
all the way up until the
moment that he died.

05:11.071 --> 05:12.091
What about his next of kin?

05:12.092 --> 05:14.172
Only surviving relative's
a brother in Poughkeepsie.

05:14.173 --> 05:16.572
We haven't reached him yet.
All right, thank you, guys.

05:17.072 --> 05:18.731
Poughkeepsie?
Hey.

05:19.558 --> 05:22.155
X-ray specs.
Got 'em at the magic shop.

05:23.140 --> 05:24.954
I can see you naked.

05:25.077 --> 05:26.342
Really?
Mm.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.079
How do you like my navel ring?

05:28.847 --> 05:30.614
Looks like somebody has a secret.

05:30.615 --> 05:34.060
A secret? Uh, what secret?

05:34.134 --> 05:36.206
I can understand a guy
not wanting to share.

05:36.207 --> 05:38.307
I mean, some things are personal.

05:39.156 --> 05:40.515
How did you find out?

05:40.896 --> 05:42.292
Dude, everybody knows.

05:42.719 --> 05:44.107
It's all over "page six."

05:49.391 --> 05:50.406
"Looks like an unhappy ending

05:50.407 --> 05:51.881
for the publisher and
the mystery writer."

05:51.882 --> 05:52.921
Apparently,

05:52.922 --> 05:57.436
he and ex-wife/girlfriend/
publisher Gina

05:57.437 --> 06:00.283
had some words...
loud words... at Le Cirque,

06:00.284 --> 06:01.676
and she stormed off.

06:01.677 --> 06:03.792
That's what he was talking
about this morning.

06:03.793 --> 06:05.295
What I don't understand
is why he would try

06:05.296 --> 06:07.948
to hide it from us.
I mean, we're like family.

06:07.949 --> 06:10.074
Maybe he's afraid of
what we might think.

06:11.949 --> 06:15.142
So it turns out a lawsuit was
filed against Zalman Drake

06:15.143 --> 06:17.652
by a Jerome Aspenall.

06:17.653 --> 06:19.046
And get this...

06:19.057 --> 06:21.058
The judge threw it out yesterday.

06:21.059 --> 06:24.454
Maybe Jerome decided to take
justice into his own hands.

06:24.872 --> 06:26.264
What was he suing him for?

06:26.265 --> 06:28.684
Zalman Drake?
I was suing him for slander,

06:28.685 --> 06:30.718
defamation of character,
ruining my life.

06:30.719 --> 06:33.930
And how did Zalman do that, Jerome?
He read my friggin' mind,

06:33.931 --> 06:36.669
in front of, like, 300 people.
During a magic performance?

06:36.670 --> 06:38.006
Yeah. It was like
this mind reading,

06:38.007 --> 06:40.687
card tricks, levitation,
at this chichi charity ball.

06:40.688 --> 06:41.708
My in-laws won a table,

06:41.709 --> 06:43.496
and I figured, free food,
some entertainment,

06:43.497 --> 06:45.774
maybe later, I get lucky.
Turns out not so lucky.

06:45.775 --> 06:47.376
Could you elaborate on that?
Yeah,

06:47.377 --> 06:49.584
this magician, Zalman Drake,
gets onstage,

06:49.585 --> 06:51.455
makes this rich dude
disappear and reappear,

06:51.456 --> 06:52.589
and I'm like, "Oh, that's cool."

06:52.590 --> 06:55.168
Then he asks for volunteers.
My wife raises my hand

06:55.169 --> 06:57.496
and says "Go up there, it'll be fun,"
so I do. Drake says,

06:57.497 --> 07:00.518
"Stand across from me and
think good thoughts," so I do.

07:00.519 --> 07:02.023
He looks at me, concentrates,

07:02.024 --> 07:04.584
puts his fingers on my forehead,
and he goes, "You're thinking

07:04.585 --> 07:08.172
of Rita and your trip to Atlantic
city last weekend." Were you?

07:08.353 --> 07:10.373
Yeah, but I was trying not to,

07:10.401 --> 07:12.428
'cause here's the kicker...
Your wife's name isn't Rita.

07:12.429 --> 07:13.700
Right.
Mm.

07:13.701 --> 07:16.534
So now I'm living in a
motel in Long Island City,

07:16.535 --> 07:19.230
my father-in-law fired me,
and Rita won't even talk to me

07:19.231 --> 07:20.662
'cause my wife found her
number and called her.

07:20.663 --> 07:22.806
Where were you last night
between 12:00 and 2:00?

07:24.167 --> 07:25.103
Why is she asking me that?

07:25.104 --> 07:28.105
Well, she wants to know if you have an alibi.
For what?

07:28.106 --> 07:31.051
Zalman Drake was
murdered last night.

07:33.638 --> 07:35.234
Justice is served.

07:37.375 --> 07:40.389
When he read your mind,
did it take him very long?

07:40.390 --> 07:43.876
No, he... No. No.
Didn't think so.

07:43.877 --> 07:46.675
Jerome, we have a witness who
says you went to his shop,

07:46.676 --> 07:48.596
attacked, and
threatened Zalman Drake.

07:48.597 --> 07:50.507
When they dropped your
lawsuit yesterday,

07:50.508 --> 07:52.986
did you decide to take the
law into your own hands?

07:52.987 --> 07:55.150
Did you go to the magic
shop and murder Zalman?

07:55.151 --> 07:56.468
No, I didn't go
anywhere last night

07:56.469 --> 07:58.563
except for O'Lannahan's
at 57th and Seventh,

07:58.564 --> 08:00.883
because thanks to Zalman Drake,
I no longer have a wife

08:00.884 --> 08:03.210
or a mistress to go home to.

08:04.085 --> 08:05.341
Wonder how Zalman did it.

08:05.342 --> 08:06.983
He must have lifted something
from Jerome's pocket

08:06.984 --> 08:09.143
with a receipt from
his weekend of sin.

08:09.144 --> 08:10.106
Like this.

08:11.786 --> 08:14.105
You had your hand in my pocket,
and I didn't even feel it?

08:14.106 --> 08:15.396
Do it again.

08:26.695 --> 08:27.594
What?

08:28.200 --> 08:29.266
Hey, Ryan.

08:30.022 --> 08:32.998
Any luck narrowing down
Zalman's whereabouts yesterday?

08:32.999 --> 08:34.337
Uh, not yet,

08:34.337 --> 08:36.907
but I did check into Jerome's
whereabouts last night.

08:36.908 --> 08:39.202
The barkeep at O'Lannahan's
said he was there till closing.

08:39.203 --> 08:40.486
He called him a cab. So the only

08:40.486 --> 08:42.461
thing he killed last night
were his brain cells.

08:42.462 --> 08:45.469
And a forensic sweep of the
water tank came up negative

08:45.470 --> 08:48.102
for any prints on the operating
apparatus other than Zalman's.

08:48.103 --> 08:50.692
So either he committed suicide...
Or the killer wore gloves.

08:50.693 --> 08:52.695
Not the whole time.
According to the lab,

08:52.696 --> 08:54.893
there were fingerprints all
over that suicide note,

08:54.894 --> 08:56.668
and they weren't
Zalman's or Jerome's.

08:56.669 --> 08:59.996
Did you get a match? Yeah,
to a Charles "Chuck" Russell.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.290
A low-life street magician

09:01.291 --> 09:02.780
with three arrests
and two convictions...

09:02.781 --> 09:04.017
one for arson and another on

09:04.018 --> 09:06.676
an explosives charge.
Did he know our victim?

09:06.677 --> 09:08.950
Yeah, apparently Zalman
is some big muckety-muck

09:08.951 --> 09:10.247
with the American Magicians Guild.

09:10.248 --> 09:12.713
They have a code of professional conduct,
and Chuck broke it.

09:12.714 --> 09:14.958
He was reckless with
pyrotechnics in his act,

09:14.959 --> 09:17.519
injured his assistant,
so Zalman had him kicked out.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.829
He hasn't been able to book a gig since.
Where can we find him?

09:20.830 --> 09:22.750
So I have Brenda's watch here.

09:22.751 --> 09:24.374
She wants me to make
her husband disappear.

09:24.375 --> 09:26.228
That's a felony. I can't do that.

09:26.229 --> 09:29.709
But I can make the
watch disappear.

09:29.710 --> 09:30.719
Give it up. That was
incredible, really.

09:32.474 --> 09:33.744
Thank you, Brenda.

09:34.939 --> 09:37.055
Aw. $1.

09:38.467 --> 09:41.455
I'll dine on raman and tap
water tonight and think of you.

09:41.875 --> 09:42.846
What about you?
You got a little something

09:42.847 --> 09:45.297
for the United Magicians College fund?

09:45.298 --> 09:46.904
As a matter of fact, I do.

09:47.027 --> 09:49.256
We need to talk to you
about Zalman Drake.

09:49.884 --> 09:51.313
Abracadabra.

10:06.210 --> 10:08.457
Alakazam, jackass.

10:22.408 --> 10:23.638
Why am I here?

10:24.238 --> 10:27.806
You recognize this?
That's a baggie and that's a letter.

10:27.807 --> 10:28.803
Next.

10:28.987 --> 10:31.663
Careful, Chucky.
Next could be a murder charge.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.951
Your fingerprints are on it.
So?

10:33.952 --> 10:36.629
So I find it strange that
someone else's fingerprints

10:36.630 --> 10:38.918
are on another guy's suicide note.

10:38.919 --> 10:42.324
What are you talking about?
Your old friend Zalman Drake.

10:42.776 --> 10:43.787
Zalman?

10:46.435 --> 10:47.709
Yeah, that's him.

10:48.146 --> 10:49.328
He killed himself?

10:49.329 --> 10:51.434
Man.
We found him drowned

10:51.435 --> 10:53.723
in the water torture
trick in his shop.

10:53.724 --> 10:55.339
You must have thought
you were pretty clever,

10:55.340 --> 10:57.306
staging it to look
like a botched escape.

10:57.307 --> 11:00.519
I didn't stage anything.
I had nothing to do with it.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.140
Well, then maybe you can
explain your prints on that.

11:08.390 --> 11:09.266
All right.

11:10.134 --> 11:13.939
No, wait. Okay, listen,
I-I-I gave him this note.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.828
You gave him a suicide note?

11:15.829 --> 11:16.587
Not that note.

11:16.588 --> 11:19.345
The other note on the paper.
The one you can't see.

11:21.756 --> 11:23.407
Hold it under a black light.

11:25.710 --> 11:28.296
It's an invoice for
services rendered.

11:28.297 --> 11:29.859
What kind of services?

11:29.860 --> 11:31.599
He wanted me to get him something,

11:32.116 --> 11:33.360
something illegal.

11:36.395 --> 11:38.591
C4 explosives?

11:38.592 --> 11:39.860
Ironic, right?

11:40.335 --> 11:41.670
He wants explosives from me

11:41.671 --> 11:43.477
when that's what he
got me booted for.

11:43.478 --> 11:45.748
But he promised to get me
reinstated in the Guild,

11:45.749 --> 11:50.257
and I wanted to work.
Whoever wrote this note

11:50.258 --> 11:52.299
probably thought they took
a blank piece of paper.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.051
Whoever being not me.

11:54.052 --> 11:58.241
You provided him with enough C4
to blow up half a city block.

11:58.242 --> 12:00.591
What was it for?
Maybe it was for a magic trick.

12:00.592 --> 12:01.506
Come on.

12:01.507 --> 12:03.768
Nah, listen, Zalman
didn't just run the shop

12:03.769 --> 12:05.509
and do corporate gigs.

12:05.519 --> 12:08.341
He was also this
genius trick designer.

12:08.642 --> 12:09.935
Rumor has it, he was creating

12:09.936 --> 12:12.899
cutting-edge illusions for
the hottest guy out there.

12:13.143 --> 12:15.499
And who is the hottest
guy out there?

12:15.734 --> 12:18.517
Tobias Strange?
He's the Johnny Depp of magic.

12:18.518 --> 12:20.727
I saw him in Vegas.
He made a Ferrari disappear.

12:20.728 --> 12:22.247
Why would anybody want to do that?
Yeah,

12:22.248 --> 12:24.341
he's in town. I saw him
perform a couple of weeks ago.

12:24.342 --> 12:26.445
Awesome, awesome show.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.795
Yeah, we loved it.

12:27.796 --> 12:28.753
We?

12:29.941 --> 12:30.959
Yeah.

12:31.325 --> 12:32.522
Me and my buddy.

12:32.966 --> 12:35.927
Ray.
You have a buddy named Ray

12:35.928 --> 12:37.404
who you went with to a magic show?

12:37.405 --> 12:39.726
Yeah. What about it?
Okay, guys,

12:39.727 --> 12:41.950
hold Chuck on an explosives
trafficking charge,

12:41.951 --> 12:44.512
and let's see if this "Johnny
Depp of magic" knows what his

12:44.513 --> 12:47.978
trick designer was really into
and why it required so much C4.

12:51.881 --> 12:52.774
Voilса.

12:55.577 --> 12:56.631
Pull it tight.

12:56.752 --> 12:58.080
All the way.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.589
Make sure it's locked.

13:00.343 --> 13:02.474
Okay, guys, 30 seconds,

13:02.799 --> 13:04.715
starting now.

13:09.318 --> 13:10.326
Excuse me.

13:12.511 --> 13:13.396
Oh, my God!

13:13.397 --> 13:14.651
Oh! Get it open!

13:17.716 --> 13:21.114
Where is he?
Hey, this is a private rehearsal.

13:21.115 --> 13:22.642
Who the hell let them in here?!

13:22.643 --> 13:24.366
All-access pass.

13:25.504 --> 13:26.574
Zalman has been the heart

13:26.575 --> 13:28.210
of the New York magic community

13:28.211 --> 13:30.453
since he inherited the
shop from his dad.

13:30.744 --> 13:34.214
It's a huge loss. I understand
that he worked for you.

13:34.415 --> 13:36.740
He used to.
We parted ways last month.

13:36.741 --> 13:38.810
Why?
I heard from one of my vendors

13:38.811 --> 13:41.026
that he might be working
for someone else,

13:41.027 --> 13:44.147
so I confronted him.
Turns out, he was poached.

13:44.148 --> 13:46.096
Do you know by whom?
He didn't say.

13:46.097 --> 13:47.182
Look, Zalman had been

13:47.183 --> 13:50.753
my exclusive designer and
engineer for 15 years.

13:50.870 --> 13:53.536
He created some of my
most famous tricks.

13:53.605 --> 13:55.322
If he had any stage presence,

13:55.323 --> 13:58.001
he would've been a
world-class magician himself.

13:58.076 --> 13:59.031
Well, it must have
been very upsetting

13:59.032 --> 14:01.271
to have him leave
after all those years.

14:02.022 --> 14:04.542
Didn't that put some of
your trade secrets at risk?

14:04.543 --> 14:06.969
A thinly veiled accusation,
Mr. Castle.

14:06.970 --> 14:08.610
Of course I was upset.

14:08.798 --> 14:10.742
But I never doubted
his discretion.

14:10.743 --> 14:12.262
Mr. Strange,
did any of your illusions

14:12.263 --> 14:15.512
require the use of an explosive?
The term "smoke and mirrors"

14:15.513 --> 14:17.968
isn't metaphoric in our
business, detective.

14:17.969 --> 14:20.752
Much of misdirection depends
on flashes of light.

14:20.753 --> 14:22.094
What about C4?

14:22.185 --> 14:24.817
The key to making
something look dangerous

14:24.818 --> 14:27.053
is to have complete
control over the outcome.

14:27.054 --> 14:31.017
C4 is too volatile,
unpredictable. It kills.

14:31.018 --> 14:33.008
Any idea what Zalman
would be using it for?

14:33.009 --> 14:34.998
Nothing magical, I assure you.

14:35.689 --> 14:37.328
Have you checked his workshop?

14:37.329 --> 14:40.478
Uh, we haven't come
across a workshop.

14:40.521 --> 14:42.461
It's probably where he'd been
disappearing to every day.

14:42.462 --> 14:44.003
Do you know where it is?
Ah,

14:44.004 --> 14:46.012
you know how magicians
are about secrets.

14:46.013 --> 14:48.094
But whatever he was working on,

14:48.211 --> 14:49.881
you would probably find there.

14:50.141 --> 14:51.356
It's an age-old story...

14:51.357 --> 14:54.939
magician at the top of his game,
angry that his trick designer

14:54.940 --> 14:56.694
has jumped ship for
the competition,

14:56.695 --> 14:57.999
kills him instead of

14:58.000 --> 15:00.272
letting his trade secrets
fall into enemy hands.

15:00.273 --> 15:02.984
It's magic, Castle,
not the Cold War.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.773
Well, if it's not the Cold War,

15:04.774 --> 15:05.348
why does Zalman need

15:05.349 --> 15:07.703
military-grade explosives?
I don't know. Hell.

15:07.704 --> 15:09.569
We don't even know if
it really was murder.

15:09.570 --> 15:12.317
For all we know, it could've
actually been a suicide.

15:13.833 --> 15:17.431
It's Lanie. Let me guess.
It wasn't a suicide.

15:18.920 --> 15:19.862
Beckett.

15:23.292 --> 15:25.665
It took you two long enough.
Where were you, Europe?

15:25.666 --> 15:28.209
Traffic. Girl,
you coulda used the gum ball.

15:28.210 --> 15:31.119
Dressed to the nines,
in a big hurry.

15:31.313 --> 15:33.969
So... where are you going
and who's the lucky victim?

15:33.970 --> 15:35.488
I'll tell you what, Castle,

15:35.489 --> 15:38.192
you tell me what's going
on between you and Gina,

15:38.193 --> 15:39.880
and I'll tell you where
I'm going tonight.

15:39.881 --> 15:41.459
What are you talking about?

15:41.460 --> 15:43.763
He and his girlfriend had
a big fight at Le Cirque.

15:43.764 --> 15:46.003
It was in the paper.
Can we talk about the victim, please?

15:46.004 --> 15:46.985
Okay.

15:48.213 --> 15:49.912
No water in the lungs.

15:50.292 --> 15:51.143
He wasn't drowned?

15:51.144 --> 15:52.425
Nope, but he was asphyxiated,

15:52.426 --> 15:54.861
which sometimes
presents the same way.

15:56.493 --> 16:00.138
Bruising. Like someone held their
hand over his nose and mouth.

16:00.139 --> 16:02.289
He was murdered before
he was put into the tank.

16:02.290 --> 16:03.969
And then his killer
took what he thought

16:03.970 --> 16:06.259
was a blank piece of paper and
typed out the suicide note.

16:06.260 --> 16:07.690
But why kill him that way?

16:07.691 --> 16:09.707
I mean, why make it look like a suicide?
Cover up the murder.

16:09.708 --> 16:13.055
The murder, or something bigger

16:13.056 --> 16:15.043
involving explosives?

16:16.814 --> 16:18.579
We gotta find that workshop.

16:24.749 --> 16:27.931
You are the picture of a
civilized evening at home.

16:27.932 --> 16:29.835
And you are a caveman.

16:29.836 --> 16:31.302
Darling, we are your family.

16:31.303 --> 16:33.324
Why didn't you tell us about this?

16:33.325 --> 16:36.075
Have you spoken to her,
you know, since your P.D.A.?

16:36.076 --> 16:37.947
My... public display of anger.

16:37.948 --> 16:40.645
It says you were fighting, dad.
What about?

16:40.646 --> 16:43.620
Well, if you must know... yes.

16:43.621 --> 16:47.010
We were fighting about how
much we've been fighting.

16:47.638 --> 16:48.804
If you don't mind, I'd really like

16:48.805 --> 16:52.075
to change the subject.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.170
What am I, 6?

16:54.410 --> 16:57.508
At least pull out a $20.
Wow.

17:00.175 --> 17:02.770
Hey, I was thinking...
Come on, Castle. Keep up.

17:03.166 --> 17:05.439
Where are we going?
Zalman's workshop.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.967
You found it? How?

17:06.968 --> 17:09.838
In his soggy wallet
was a soggy metrocard.

17:09.839 --> 17:12.224
Ryan ran it through the
automated fare database.

17:12.226 --> 17:15.435
He was traveling from a subway
stop near his magic shop

17:15.435 --> 17:17.251
to the last stop out in the Bronx.

17:17.252 --> 17:18.468
So we're canvassing
the neighborhood.

17:18.469 --> 17:20.627
Do we need vests?
No, no vests.

17:20.628 --> 17:22.440
Remember that power outage
a couple of weeks ago,

17:22.441 --> 17:23.502
shut down the subway?
Yes.

17:23.502 --> 17:25.469
Well, I looked into
Zalman's financials.

17:25.470 --> 17:27.990
He hired a town car that
day with his credit card,

17:27.991 --> 17:30.914
and we now have his address.

17:41.167 --> 17:42.766
You sure this is the place?

17:42.767 --> 17:44.459
This is where they
dropped him off.

17:44.614 --> 17:47.779
Well, it looks abandoned,
bricked up.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.215
Look, look, look.

17:49.216 --> 17:50.229
Footprints.

17:50.358 --> 17:52.140
Yes, to nowhere.

17:53.024 --> 17:55.625
That's what he wanted us to think.

18:00.052 --> 18:01.741
Open Sesame.

18:10.113 --> 18:12.297
Zalman's fortress of solitude.

18:19.616 --> 18:20.957
Wow, Castle.

18:21.496 --> 18:23.351
My grandfather would've
loved this place.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.324
Look, he has a guillotine...

18:27.658 --> 18:29.789
And an iron maiden.

18:29.819 --> 18:32.835
He even had a zig zag box.

18:33.791 --> 18:36.291
You know, you would've
liked my grandfather.

18:37.319 --> 18:39.873
In fact, you remind
me of him a little.

18:40.725 --> 18:42.255
I'm flattered.
Hmm.

18:47.609 --> 18:48.378
Wheelchair tracks?

18:48.379 --> 18:50.670
Yeah, and they look fairly fresh.

18:51.193 --> 18:52.572
Maybe he had a visitor.

18:52.573 --> 18:53.488
Mm-hmm.

18:55.699 --> 18:56.733
They look recent.

18:57.835 --> 19:00.381
These papers are dated
the day he was killed.

19:01.025 --> 19:03.719
I'm gonna have to get C.S.U.
to sweep this whole place.

19:06.969 --> 19:09.069
Is this an accident or art?

19:13.986 --> 19:15.646
Castle, take a look at this.

19:17.474 --> 19:18.892
The pages are ripped,

19:18.893 --> 19:21.514
like he didn't want anyone to
know what he was working on.

19:25.548 --> 19:26.579
Zalman?

19:28.260 --> 19:29.496
Who the hell are you?

19:29.768 --> 19:31.696
Best trick ever.

19:40.655 --> 19:43.395
NYPD. Keep your hands
where I can see them.

19:45.741 --> 19:46.278
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:46.279 --> 19:48.372
What... what's going on?
What are you doing here?

19:49.342 --> 19:49.970
Zalman?

19:49.971 --> 19:53.607
Edmund. Edmund Drake.
His brother from Poughkeepsie?

19:53.608 --> 19:55.300
You're a twin.
Yeah.

19:57.256 --> 19:59.940
Can I put my hands down?
Uh, yeah.

20:00.713 --> 20:02.797
Why were you hiding
in the iron maiden?

20:03.459 --> 20:04.848
It's the entrance
from the other room.

20:04.849 --> 20:07.454
I'm detective Beckett.
We're here about your brother.

20:07.537 --> 20:10.236
So am I.
Where is he?

20:10.298 --> 20:11.429
You don't know?

20:12.353 --> 20:14.431
Mr. Drake, I'm sorry to tell you,

20:14.432 --> 20:16.165
but your brother is dead.

20:21.425 --> 20:22.621
Are you kidding me?

20:22.801 --> 20:25.879
He has an identical
twin who wears glasses.

20:25.880 --> 20:29.049
That's the worst disguise since
Clark Kent, and you believe him?

20:29.050 --> 20:32.224
I have no reason not to.
Look at him. He's devastated.

20:32.225 --> 20:34.950
It's an act. Don't you
ever go to movies?

20:35.306 --> 20:36.241
It's...

20:37.049 --> 20:38.740
It's probably Edmund who's dead,

20:38.741 --> 20:40.123
and that dweeb in the
next room is Zalman.

20:40.124 --> 20:43.257
I bet he killed his brother
to take over his life.

20:43.756 --> 20:46.240
As an accountant in Poughkeepsie?

20:47.005 --> 20:47.985
Well, I...

20:50.482 --> 20:52.123
I knew something was wrong

20:52.124 --> 20:54.215
when he called me a
couple of days ago.

20:54.216 --> 20:55.711
What did he call about?

20:56.627 --> 20:57.541
Money.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.951
He said someone was paying
him a half a million dollars,

20:59.952 --> 21:03.213
and he needed my help to hide it.
Hide it how?

21:03.214 --> 21:04.781
To make sure that the
government never found out

21:04.782 --> 21:06.066
where it came from.

21:06.559 --> 21:07.599
The way he was talking,
it sounded like

21:07.600 --> 21:09.736
he'd gotten involved
in something illegal.

21:09.737 --> 21:12.128
And what were you doing
at his warehouse?

21:12.129 --> 21:14.137
Well, I just had this
feeling yesterday

21:14.160 --> 21:15.783
that something was terribly wrong,

21:16.176 --> 21:18.389
and when I tried to reach him,
I couldn't.

21:18.665 --> 21:21.120
I drove down to the city.
I think it was the twin thing.

21:21.121 --> 21:24.811
You know, all our lives,
we've had this connection.

21:24.812 --> 21:27.024
Yeah, of course.
The twin thing.

21:27.413 --> 21:29.064
Tell me, Mr. Drake,

21:29.397 --> 21:30.879
given your legacy,

21:31.252 --> 21:33.808
why didn't you ever get into
the family business, too?

21:33.951 --> 21:37.226
No, I didn't have the passion...
Or the skill.

21:37.718 --> 21:39.219
Zalman and I, we, uh,

21:39.935 --> 21:42.955
we did have an act
together as kids.

21:49.444 --> 21:51.238
He would disappear up on stage,

21:51.239 --> 21:54.485
and then... then I would appear
in the back of the audience.

21:54.797 --> 21:55.694
I guess it was only amazing

21:55.695 --> 21:58.261
to people who didn't
know we were twins.

21:58.262 --> 22:00.483
Well, you're being modest.

22:00.759 --> 22:02.587
I'm sure you fooled
a lot of people.

22:03.518 --> 22:06.867
Mr. Drake, the activities that
your brother was involved in,

22:06.868 --> 22:09.124
if you looked through
his things, do you think

22:09.125 --> 22:11.480
that you would be able to
determine what he was doing?

22:11.481 --> 22:12.871
Zalman was a brilliant engineer,

22:12.872 --> 22:16.750
and, uh, I'm afraid my brain
just doesn't work that way.

22:16.871 --> 22:18.598
He was someone special, you know?

22:19.086 --> 22:20.212
Light up a room.

22:21.384 --> 22:23.046
Look, detective, I don't
know what he got mixed up in.

22:23.047 --> 22:26.199
But I just know,
he didn't deserve to die.

22:30.503 --> 22:32.231
I can't believe you're letting
him just walk out of here.

22:32.232 --> 22:34.222
If this was a movie...
It's not a movie,

22:34.223 --> 22:36.589
and what am I supposed
to charge him with,

22:36.865 --> 22:37.700
being a twin?

22:37.701 --> 22:40.169
Being an evil twin
in a magic murder.

22:40.170 --> 22:42.501
A half-a-million-dollar
payment that he's hiding

22:42.502 --> 22:45.576
from the government, bricks of C4?

22:45.577 --> 22:47.990
That doesn't sound
like magic to me.

22:49.925 --> 22:50.620
Beckett.

22:50.621 --> 22:53.224
C.S.U. is just finishing
their initial sweep.

22:53.268 --> 22:54.853
So far we haven't been
able to find anything

22:54.854 --> 22:56.988
to indicate who Zalman
might have been working for

22:56.989 --> 22:58.858
other than Tobias Strange,

22:58.859 --> 23:02.285
but C.S.U. did find some trace
residue of C4 explosives

23:02.286 --> 23:03.372
on the workbench.

23:03.373 --> 23:04.844
And what about the tracks?

23:04.845 --> 23:08.058
You were right.
They are from a wheelchair.

23:08.175 --> 23:09.620
The tracks are pretty distinctive.

23:09.621 --> 23:12.262
We're running down make and model now.
Yeah, well, with any luck,

23:12.263 --> 23:14.936
Professor X will turn out to
be Zalman's mystery client.

23:14.937 --> 23:16.205
Right. Thanks.

23:17.529 --> 23:20.648
What about this?
Zalman gets in over his head,

23:20.649 --> 23:22.032
he lures his brother down here,

23:22.033 --> 23:23.482
suffocates him,
sticks him in a tank

23:23.483 --> 23:25.056
so it looks like he's dead.

23:25.057 --> 23:29.588
Meanwhile, Zalman, as Edmund,
inherits his own magic shop

23:29.589 --> 23:32.077
collects his own insurance,
all the while

23:32.078 --> 23:34.085
takes Edmund's wife and children,

23:34.086 --> 23:35.981
who love him, as his own.

23:37.398 --> 23:39.626
It's "dead ringer."
Are you still talking?

23:39.749 --> 23:41.114
Edmund is Zalman.

23:41.367 --> 23:42.637
Couldn't be more wrong.

23:42.638 --> 23:45.595
I ran the prints on our victim.
He is Zalman.

23:45.774 --> 23:47.990
Satisfied, Castle?
More like disappointed.

23:47.991 --> 23:50.276
Well, maybe this
will cheer you up.

23:51.119 --> 23:52.416
Old man hair.

23:52.417 --> 23:53.590
White rabbit fur.

23:53.591 --> 23:55.314
It came from his teeth and throat.

23:55.315 --> 23:57.475
So he was killed by a rabbit

23:57.476 --> 23:59.553
who did not want to be
pulled out of a hat.

23:59.554 --> 24:01.073
Your guess is as good as mine.

24:01.074 --> 24:02.634
In the process of
trying to determine

24:02.635 --> 24:05.081
how Zalman was asphyxiated,
I also discovered

24:05.082 --> 24:07.743
the presence of a low
dose of organophosphates

24:07.744 --> 24:09.190
in his nose and throat.

24:09.191 --> 24:10.661
Organophosphates?

24:10.662 --> 24:13.414
It's found in hydraulic fluids,
jet engine oil,

24:13.415 --> 24:16.371
insecticides, nerve agents.
Nerve agents?

24:16.372 --> 24:17.347
Well, along with the C4,

24:17.348 --> 24:18.081
our magician's sounding

24:18.082 --> 24:20.513
more like a terrorist.
The amount is too small

24:20.514 --> 24:22.864
to indicate that he had been
working with them directly,

24:22.865 --> 24:26.254
- but he definitely was exposed
to them recently. - Oye, chica.

24:26.255 --> 24:27.100
I was in the hood, and I

24:27.101 --> 24:29.515
thought that we should
talk about the... tests...

24:30.224 --> 24:31.209
That you had me run.

24:31.210 --> 24:33.585
Um, they're in the back.
I'll go get 'em.

24:34.834 --> 24:37.648
Yeah. Thanks.
What tests?

24:37.649 --> 24:40.246
Different case.
Hey, I was just about to call you.

24:40.274 --> 24:41.209
You know those wheelchair tracks

24:41.210 --> 24:42.700
that you found at
Zalman's workshop?

24:42.701 --> 24:44.034
Well, they had a sawtooth pattern

24:44.035 --> 24:47.039
unique to one brand of tire
made for electric wheelchairs.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.574
We called the half a
dozen specialty shops

24:48.575 --> 24:50.750
that stock that tire,
and we cross referenced

24:50.751 --> 24:52.536
recent purchases
with the mailing list

24:52.537 --> 24:54.443
of the magic shop.
Did you get a match?

24:54.444 --> 24:59.020
Yeah. Thaddeus Magnus.

24:59.021 --> 25:00.987
He's a professional
government protestor.

25:00.988 --> 25:02.927
He's got multiple arrests
for civil disobediences,

25:02.928 --> 25:05.494
and get this...
he drives a white van.

25:05.495 --> 25:07.306
Government protestor,
civil disobedience.

25:07.307 --> 25:09.785
You mix that in with
C4 and nerve agent,

25:09.786 --> 25:13.470
you're looking at Tim McVeigh.
You have an address?

25:14.507 --> 25:15.527
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

25:15.528 --> 25:16.445
Nice work.

25:19.744 --> 25:21.234
That... was close.

25:21.441 --> 25:23.025
No. This...

25:25.190 --> 25:26.203
Is close.

25:29.248 --> 25:30.190
How does a guy in a wheelchair

25:30.191 --> 25:32.578
lift someone into a tank of water?

25:34.677 --> 25:37.842
Mr. Magnus, NYPD. Open up.

25:38.679 --> 25:40.354
Maybe the wheelchair is an act.

25:41.072 --> 25:43.797
In every magic story,
there's an unexpected twist

25:43.798 --> 25:45.393
where things aren't
always what they seem.

25:45.394 --> 25:47.009
It's an obligation of the genre.

25:47.989 --> 25:49.892
What?
NYPD.

25:49.893 --> 25:52.650
We need to ask you a few
questions about Zalman Drake.

25:53.423 --> 25:54.986
Zalman Drake

25:54.987 --> 25:56.805
of Drake Magic.

25:58.336 --> 26:00.147
End of an era.

26:01.497 --> 26:02.995
I hear it was a failed escape.

26:02.996 --> 26:05.785
More like a successful murder.
Oh?

26:05.786 --> 26:08.926
He was asphyxiated before he
was lowered into the tank.

26:09.224 --> 26:10.809
You mean he was really murdered?

26:10.810 --> 26:13.833
And guess whose van was
spotted outside his shop

26:13.834 --> 26:15.187
right about when he died.

26:15.188 --> 26:17.604
Would you just not touch that, please?
Who wants the ball?

26:17.605 --> 26:19.648
It took me five years to build it.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.807
What was he working on for you?

26:22.109 --> 26:24.530
What were the explosives for?
Explosives?

26:24.531 --> 26:26.256
What are you talking about?

26:26.613 --> 26:29.720
Look, Zalman was my friend.

26:30.164 --> 26:31.256
He didn't work for me.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.745
I worked for him,
making specialty items

26:34.746 --> 26:36.234
for those tricks he designed.

26:36.235 --> 26:38.609
Nothing explosive.

26:38.818 --> 26:41.449
Just... well, things like that.

26:41.450 --> 26:42.896
Doesn't change the fact,

26:42.897 --> 26:44.328
you were at his
store when he died.

26:44.329 --> 26:47.040
Does it look like I could've
lifted him into a tank?

26:47.041 --> 26:49.148
Well, maybe you
borrowed a set of legs.

26:49.294 --> 26:51.923
Maybe these or someone else's.
Stop it.

26:52.519 --> 26:55.989
If anyone killed him, it was those guys he met.
What guys?

26:55.990 --> 26:57.876
The guys he was working for.

26:58.198 --> 27:00.110
I was there at the
warehouse when they called.

27:00.111 --> 27:02.941
I went there to pick up a check
for some work I did on the job.

27:02.942 --> 27:05.424
They wanted to meet him.

27:05.425 --> 27:08.749
Told him to go to the
store after closing.

27:09.490 --> 27:12.436
Zalman... asked me
to drop him off.

27:13.448 --> 27:15.387
Next thing I hear, he's dead.

27:15.745 --> 27:17.657
I didn't know it was murder.

27:17.658 --> 27:20.301
The job that you did for him,
what was it?

27:20.666 --> 27:22.649
Well, he wanted me to
make him a mechanical arm.

27:22.650 --> 27:25.618
You know, something to
trigger a switch remotely.

27:25.619 --> 27:27.301
Theoretically,
what could it trigger?

27:27.302 --> 27:30.132
Well, anything...
turn on a light, ring a bell.

27:30.133 --> 27:31.745
Set off a bomb?

27:33.339 --> 27:35.878
Oh, look, I swear,
I thought he was joking.

27:35.879 --> 27:37.458
About what?

27:37.463 --> 27:40.444
He said this was his
greatest magic trick ever.

27:40.936 --> 27:43.163
Said he was getting paid a fortune

27:43.459 --> 27:45.091
to get away with murder.

27:54.979 --> 27:56.747
You really think someone
would hire a magician

27:56.748 --> 27:59.137
to help them get away with murder?
I mean, it's brilliant really.

27:59.138 --> 28:01.618
Magicians are masters
at misdirection.

28:01.619 --> 28:03.122
If they can manipulate audiences,

28:03.123 --> 28:05.168
they can manipulate witnesses.

28:05.169 --> 28:06.665
They could even
make people testify

28:06.666 --> 28:09.057
to things that never happened.
It's just so hard to believe

28:09.058 --> 28:11.088
that a person with that
much respect for magic

28:11.089 --> 28:13.530
would use his skills to kill.
He needed to save his shop,

28:13.531 --> 28:16.427
and a half-a-million-dollar
payday was too good to be true.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.570
And it was. Instead of a payday,
he got whacked.

28:18.571 --> 28:20.286
Well, the people who hired
him probably figured

28:20.287 --> 28:22.574
it was safer to kill
him than run the risk

28:22.575 --> 28:25.309
of having an attack of
conscience and rat them out.

28:25.310 --> 28:27.982
Okay, so without evidence,
how are we gonna find 'em?

28:27.983 --> 28:31.180
By finding out exactly who
they hired Zalman to kill.

28:31.181 --> 28:33.001
We know he was working on a trick

28:33.002 --> 28:36.150
involving C4 and a
remote triggering device.

28:36.151 --> 28:38.175
Well, whoever he killed
went out with a bang.

28:38.176 --> 28:39.696
There can't have
been that many deaths

28:39.697 --> 28:41.592
in the tristate area in
the last couple of weeks

28:41.593 --> 28:43.809
where someone was
killed by an explosion.

28:43.810 --> 28:45.672
Where are we with ATF
and the fire department?

28:45.673 --> 28:47.159
We're supposed to get their
reports in the morning.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.880
Okay, meantime, let's see
what we can dig up ourselves.

28:54.418 --> 28:55.970
You know how many
explosions there are

28:55.971 --> 28:58.706
in New York City every week?

28:58.707 --> 29:00.608
Steam pipe explodes.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.005
Gas stove explodes.

29:03.006 --> 29:05.341
Unhappy couple explodes.

29:06.164 --> 29:07.944
Well, didn't you explode in
a rather ritzy restaurant

29:07.945 --> 29:09.077
with, uh...

29:09.078 --> 29:11.812
Aha. Speak of the devil.

29:15.946 --> 29:17.286
You're not gonna answer that?

29:21.194 --> 29:24.116
Answer what?
Ooh. Well done.

29:24.312 --> 29:25.928
Of course, making
your phone disappear

29:25.929 --> 29:28.486
doesn't make your
problem disappear.

29:28.487 --> 29:29.452
No.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.470
Hey, come on, kiddo.

29:32.072 --> 29:34.350
What's going on with
you two, really?

29:34.351 --> 29:35.482
Nothing's going on.

29:36.057 --> 29:38.309
No, nothing at all.
Everything is fine.

29:38.433 --> 29:39.564
Everything is...

29:41.000 --> 29:42.747
Just fine.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.428
It's ordinary.

29:45.650 --> 29:46.956
The problem is, I...

29:47.472 --> 29:48.876
I don't want ordinary.

29:49.599 --> 29:50.444
I want...

29:50.445 --> 29:51.465
Magic.

29:53.693 --> 29:55.721
Yeah. You know what
the problem is,

29:56.276 --> 29:57.802
is we just aren't in love.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.041
Neither one of us
wants to admit...

30:02.014 --> 30:04.344
Organophosphates.

30:06.614 --> 30:08.869
It wasn't a nerve agent.
It was jet oil.

30:08.870 --> 30:11.613
Zalman was at an airport.
What? I...

30:11.614 --> 30:12.597
I gotta go.

30:13.903 --> 30:15.707
Now you see him, now you don't.

30:15.708 --> 30:18.921
Hey. I think I figured out
who Zalman was paid to kill.

30:18.922 --> 30:21.177
Billionaire philanthropist
Christian Dahl?

30:21.178 --> 30:22.317
How did you...

30:24.028 --> 30:26.583
Organophosphates,
jet oil, airport.

30:26.584 --> 30:28.843
It's like we could be twins.

30:29.095 --> 30:30.253
Connection.

30:30.254 --> 30:31.362
Conjecture.

30:31.363 --> 30:32.974
All we know right now is that Dahl

30:32.975 --> 30:34.759
took off from Teterboro
Saturday afternoon

30:34.760 --> 30:38.253
intending to set a transatlantic
speed record in his jet.

30:38.254 --> 30:39.254
Apparently, something went wrong,

30:39.255 --> 30:40.907
and the plane broke up midair.

30:40.908 --> 30:43.173
Witnesses out on an oil tanker
out on Long Island sound

30:43.174 --> 30:45.814
claim to have seen a white
flash and smoke in the sky.

30:45.815 --> 30:47.381
Well, a midair explosion

30:47.382 --> 30:49.662
would account for all the C4
that Zalman bought from Chuck.

30:49.663 --> 30:51.765
And Magnus' remote
triggering device.

30:51.766 --> 30:53.111
Well, whoever wanted
Christian dead

30:53.112 --> 30:54.583
probably killed Zalman
to cover up the crime.

30:54.584 --> 30:57.068
Except all we have
now is speculation.

30:57.069 --> 30:59.567
Yo. I just got off with the F.A.A.

30:59.568 --> 31:01.683
They're sending over
footage of the takeoff.

31:05.623 --> 31:07.876
Okay, there's Dahl
getting on his jet

31:07.877 --> 31:10.290
for the transatlantic
flight attempt.

31:11.366 --> 31:13.195
Looks like he's
doing his preflight.

31:14.791 --> 31:15.821
Look at that.

31:15.822 --> 31:18.818
It matches the outline on the
wall in Zalman's workshop.

31:19.663 --> 31:21.507
He was painting a decal.

31:23.775 --> 31:25.268
Zoom in on that guy.

31:27.543 --> 31:28.822
It's Zalman Drake.

31:30.317 --> 31:32.130
He dressed like a caterer.

31:32.131 --> 31:34.135
Probably so he can
get past security.

31:36.069 --> 31:39.411
He delivered something.
Yeah, explosives and a triggering device.

31:39.412 --> 31:41.151
This was a murder for hire.

31:41.748 --> 31:42.871
Skip ahead.

31:44.005 --> 31:44.902
And freeze it.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.014
He planned for
Christian Dahl's plane

31:46.015 --> 31:47.606
to break up over the Atlantic.

31:47.607 --> 31:49.756
It's the perfect crime...
No evidence...

31:49.757 --> 31:51.526
No body... no killer.

31:57.904 --> 32:00.154
You are crazy. I've never
even tried anything like...

32:00.155 --> 32:03.160
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, me, too. Bye.
Who was that?

32:03.161 --> 32:05.434
Coast guard. I was just
seeing if they, uh,

32:05.435 --> 32:07.272
found the plane's data recorder.
Hmm. Did they?

32:07.273 --> 32:10.956
Did they what?
Hey, guys, where are you on Christian Dahl?

32:11.072 --> 32:13.130
This guy was unbelievable.

32:13.131 --> 32:15.618
He became a billionaire
by always being exactly

32:15.619 --> 32:18.373
in the right place at exactly
the right time to invest

32:18.374 --> 32:21.469
in whatever stock, product or
idea was just about to hit.

32:21.470 --> 32:23.774
Did he have any enemies,
anyone that was threatening him?

32:23.775 --> 32:25.440
No, all the people I
talked to loved him.

32:25.441 --> 32:27.130
He gave away more
money than Oprah,

32:27.131 --> 32:28.287
and he gave a lot of money

32:28.288 --> 32:30.681
to research into the occult.
He climbed Everest,

32:30.682 --> 32:32.687
he flew across Europe
in a hot air balloon,

32:32.688 --> 32:34.935
he even drove a dog
sled in the iditarod.

32:34.936 --> 32:36.220
Well, with that
much going for him,

32:36.221 --> 32:37.598
he had to have had
a couple of haters.

32:37.599 --> 32:42.742
Just one, and she had both
motive and opportunity.

32:44.906 --> 32:45.768
Naomi Weldon?

32:45.769 --> 32:47.506
Naomi Weldon Dahl...

32:47.507 --> 32:51.345
Christian's wife and a
former fashion model.

32:51.346 --> 32:52.778
Apparently, a month ago,

32:52.779 --> 32:54.586
Christian caught her
having an affair,

32:54.587 --> 32:57.283
and according to their prenup,
if he divorced her,

32:57.284 --> 32:58.397
she wound up with nothing.

32:58.398 --> 33:01.426
And if he dies,
she inherits billions.

33:01.427 --> 33:04.083
Where was this photo taken?
Ah, you noticed.

33:04.084 --> 33:06.782
The Dahl Foundation
benefit six weeks ago.

33:06.783 --> 33:10.030
And the entertainment for the
evening was... Zalman Drake.

33:10.031 --> 33:10.722
You know, Jerome did say

33:10.723 --> 33:12.348
Zalman made someone
disappear that night.

33:12.349 --> 33:13.896
Naomi sees his performance

33:13.897 --> 33:16.927
and wonders if Zalman can make
her husband disappear forever.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.475
And with billions on the line...

33:18.476 --> 33:20.165
Half a million's
just chump change.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.068
When they told me that
Christian's plane disappeared,

33:22.069 --> 33:23.300
that's exactly what I thought.

33:23.301 --> 33:25.977
That your husband's
death was no accident?

33:25.978 --> 33:29.414
Christian was a perfectionist,
and he was superstitious.

33:29.415 --> 33:31.988
He did three background
checks before he married me.

33:32.588 --> 33:33.539
You and your husband had

33:33.540 --> 33:36.240
an airtight prenuptial agreement.

33:36.372 --> 33:38.894
Standard when two
high-profile people marry.

33:38.895 --> 33:41.382
And if you left the
marriage or had an affair,

33:41.383 --> 33:42.797
you'd be leaving the marriage

33:42.798 --> 33:45.191
without spousal or child support.

33:45.192 --> 33:46.675
Those were the terms.

33:47.258 --> 33:49.965
I have my own career.
I can take care of myself.

33:49.966 --> 33:51.606
But you were having an affair.

33:51.607 --> 33:55.115
Whether or not I had an
affair is none of your affair.

33:55.116 --> 33:57.423
If you're implying that
I murdered my husband

33:57.424 --> 34:00.009
to be with someone else,
you're mistaken.

34:00.052 --> 34:03.297
I wouldn't kill anyone.
Not even to inherit a fortune?

34:04.163 --> 34:06.127
Well, then the joke
would be on me.

34:06.189 --> 34:07.800
There is no fortune.

34:07.892 --> 34:10.205
All of Christian's
accounts have been frozen.

34:10.206 --> 34:11.289
You mean you're in probate.

34:11.290 --> 34:14.549
No, I mean frozen.
Why?

34:14.802 --> 34:17.382
You'll have to ask the
district attorney's office.

34:17.571 --> 34:19.327
God knows, they wouldn't tell me.

34:20.417 --> 34:21.681
That was the D.A.

34:21.681 --> 34:23.409
Apparently,
at the time of his death,

34:23.409 --> 34:24.706
our billionaire investment guru

34:24.708 --> 34:27.474
was being investigated
by the S.E.C.

34:27.475 --> 34:29.130
They thought that he
was making his money

34:29.132 --> 34:31.898
the old-fashioned way,
by stealing it.

34:31.899 --> 34:34.866
All of his amazing stock
returns were falsified.

34:34.867 --> 34:36.757
The whole thing was
a Ponzi scheme.

34:36.757 --> 34:38.777
As it turns out,
they were a couple of weeks away

34:38.779 --> 34:41.978
from indicting Christian
Dahl for massive fraud.

34:41.980 --> 34:43.433
He was gonna lose everything

34:43.434 --> 34:46.302
and face 50 years
in federal prison.

34:46.303 --> 34:47.288
If I were him,
I'd want to disappear,

34:47.289 --> 34:49.802
too. And what better
way to disappear...

34:49.803 --> 34:52.080
Than hire a magician?
Bingo.

34:52.109 --> 34:55.146
Christian Dahl is on the plane
doing his preflight check.

34:55.500 --> 34:57.410
Zalman leaves the plane...

34:58.020 --> 35:00.428
Dahl taxis to the
runway and takes off.

35:00.429 --> 35:02.017
Well, he had to have
gotten off at some point,

35:02.018 --> 35:03.992
otherwise, it would've
been a suicide mission,

35:03.993 --> 35:05.901
and you don't need a
magician for that.

35:07.896 --> 35:08.924
Unless...

35:11.425 --> 35:13.185
That isn't Christian Dahl.

35:13.186 --> 35:16.221
It looks just like him.
Dummy.

35:16.658 --> 35:19.139
Not you.
The... on... in the cockpit.

35:19.140 --> 35:21.263
They switched out real
Dahl for dummy Dahl.

35:21.264 --> 35:24.209
Magnus didn't build a triggering
device for an explosion.

35:24.210 --> 35:26.320
The arm he built was for
doing the preflight check.

35:26.321 --> 35:28.826
The whole thing's an automaton.
That's the magic trick.

35:28.827 --> 35:30.549
He made it look to the
world like Christian Dahl

35:30.550 --> 35:32.949
was still on the plane,
the same way Tobias Strange made it look

35:32.950 --> 35:34.252
like he was still
in the cabinet when

35:34.253 --> 35:36.180
the swords went in.
And then he used the catering box

35:36.181 --> 35:39.392
to get the dummy on board
and Christian Dahl off.

35:39.932 --> 35:41.252
Then who's piloting that plane?

35:41.253 --> 35:44.327
Christian Dahl,
only not from the cockpit.

35:44.328 --> 35:47.283
He had it rigged to fly
via remote control. See?

35:47.580 --> 35:48.717
Zalman puts the box in the van.

35:48.718 --> 35:50.422
There's probably a
console inside there

35:50.423 --> 35:53.102
linked to the plane's avionics.
Dahl takes off remotely...

35:53.103 --> 35:54.421
Flies out over the Atlantic...

35:54.422 --> 35:55.774
And then he detonates
the explosion,

35:55.775 --> 35:57.199
and everyone thinks that he's dead

35:57.200 --> 35:58.926
because everyone's
seen him on board.

35:58.927 --> 36:01.046
Only Dahl is very much alive,

36:01.047 --> 36:03.342
and there's only one person
in the world that knows it.

36:03.343 --> 36:05.735
Zalman, and as long as he's alive,
he's a threat to Dahl.

36:05.736 --> 36:07.733
So Dahl has to tie up
that one loose end.

36:07.734 --> 36:10.600
But he can't risk anyone
knowing that he's still alive.

36:10.601 --> 36:13.971
So Dahl has to kill
Zalman himself.

36:18.198 --> 36:19.140
What?

36:21.446 --> 36:22.890
Nothing. So what do we do now?

36:24.781 --> 36:26.403
Well, it's four days
since the accident.

36:26.404 --> 36:28.687
Christian Dahl is probably in
some non-extradition country

36:28.688 --> 36:30.243
with a chunk of his
fortune by now.

36:30.244 --> 36:31.617
Yeah, probably.

36:33.174 --> 36:34.162
Unless...

36:34.757 --> 36:35.799
Unless what?

36:36.508 --> 36:38.299
Well, Dahl does
everything publicly.

36:38.300 --> 36:40.387
The guy loves being famous.
Everyone thinks he's dead.

36:40.388 --> 36:44.137
A guy like that...
No, it's crazy.

36:44.387 --> 36:47.025
Castle, crazy is exactly
what we need right now.

36:54.097 --> 36:57.464
Castle, this is crazy.
Crazy but in character.

36:57.465 --> 36:59.383
Look at the kind of guy
Christian Dahl was...

36:59.384 --> 37:00.944
How he loved the limelight,

37:00.945 --> 37:02.897
his fascination with
life after death.

37:02.898 --> 37:04.921
You think a guy like that is
gonna miss the opportunity

37:04.922 --> 37:06.579
to attend his own funeral?

37:06.580 --> 37:08.881
Would you?
Not a chance.

37:09.868 --> 37:12.438
Okay, so if he's here,
how do we find him?

37:12.439 --> 37:15.011
Well, he'll be in disguise,
of course.

37:15.638 --> 37:17.091
Look for an anomaly,

37:17.415 --> 37:21.394
someone who's trying to fit in
yet sticking to the outskirts,

37:22.031 --> 37:24.111
someone who isn't
engaging in conversation

37:24.112 --> 37:25.492
but at the same time,

37:25.493 --> 37:27.444
eavesdropping on other
people's conversations.

37:27.445 --> 37:31.111
Someone who's... got long hair,
a beard, and $1,000 shoes?

37:34.604 --> 37:35.873
Yeah, that'll work, too.

37:37.315 --> 37:38.481
Mr. Dahl.

37:41.899 --> 37:43.454
You shoulda stayed dead, bro.

37:45.395 --> 37:46.812
So I faked my own death.

37:46.813 --> 37:48.510
So what? That's not a crime.

37:49.035 --> 37:51.704
What are you gonna charge me with,
littering the Atlantic?

37:51.705 --> 37:53.631
I'll stand in line behind B.P.

37:53.898 --> 37:56.161
The charge is premeditated murder.

37:56.162 --> 37:57.591
We figured out your little trick.

37:57.592 --> 37:59.208
Zalman performed for
your charity event.

37:59.209 --> 38:01.576
He made you disappear,
giving you the inspiration

38:01.577 --> 38:04.224
to pull the ultimate escape.
You knew he needed money,

38:04.225 --> 38:06.170
so you made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

38:06.171 --> 38:08.968
But you never planned on paying him,
did you, Mr. Dahl?

38:08.969 --> 38:11.033
No, you planned on
using his desperation

38:11.034 --> 38:13.104
over the loss of
his family's legacy

38:13.105 --> 38:16.193
to make people think that
he committed suicide.

38:16.194 --> 38:18.197
Staging a shooting,
it's too cumbersome.

38:18.198 --> 38:20.682
Too many questions.
Where'd the gun come from?

38:20.979 --> 38:23.482
So you used what you had
on hand to get rid of

38:23.483 --> 38:26.091
the only person on earth who
knew you were still alive.

38:26.528 --> 38:28.671
Once he was gone,
you'd be free and clear.

38:30.418 --> 38:30.992
Is...

38:30.993 --> 38:33.033
Is that what you do when
you can't solve a crime,

38:33.034 --> 38:35.021
concoct fantasies?

38:35.610 --> 38:37.244
The rabbit hair that
lined your gloves

38:37.245 --> 38:39.174
was found on our victim.

38:39.689 --> 38:41.759
You called Zalman,
met him at his shop,

38:41.760 --> 38:43.952
put your gloved
hand over his mouth,

38:43.953 --> 38:46.037
and then you smothered him.

38:47.808 --> 38:50.542
If you think I'm afraid
of you or the S.E.C...

38:51.705 --> 38:55.686
I will beat your pants off and
enjoy every minute of it...

38:58.521 --> 39:02.389
Assuming you can find
me once I'm out on bail.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.265
It's not me that you should
be scared of, Mr. Dahl,

39:05.266 --> 39:07.018
or the S.E.C.

39:07.682 --> 39:10.007
You should be afraid
of what you've become.

39:10.369 --> 39:11.553
Well, if you're done
with your lecture

39:11.554 --> 39:13.740
or your petty threats,
I'd like to see my...

39:18.376 --> 39:19.453
My lawyer.

39:20.570 --> 39:22.027
Something wrong, Dahl?

39:22.991 --> 39:23.924
No.

39:26.937 --> 39:28.189
Christian?

39:28.507 --> 39:29.342
H...

39:29.897 --> 39:31.197
How are you doing that?

39:32.449 --> 39:34.061
Doing what?

39:37.755 --> 39:38.699
Aah!

39:40.785 --> 39:42.700
Is he having flashbacks?
I don't know.

39:43.631 --> 39:44.640
Do you see him?

39:44.641 --> 39:45.519
Who?

39:45.647 --> 39:46.827
He was right here.

39:47.490 --> 39:48.675
Oh, God.

39:49.639 --> 39:52.299
You can't... you can't be here.

39:53.823 --> 39:54.963
You're dead!

39:56.895 --> 39:57.902
You're dead. I...

40:01.522 --> 40:02.559
I killed you.

40:10.799 --> 40:12.713
Alakazam, jackass.

40:19.987 --> 40:21.085
How did you know that would work?

40:21.086 --> 40:22.884
I didn't. I just
knew he'd lawyer up.

40:22.885 --> 40:24.688
So I figured, why not take a shot?

40:25.244 --> 40:27.035
Your grandfather would be proud.

40:27.117 --> 40:28.500
Thank you so much, gentlemen.

40:28.501 --> 40:31.273
Always a pleasure to
lend a hand to the NYPD.

40:31.468 --> 40:33.648
I might add this one
to my repertoire

40:33.659 --> 40:35.432
in tribute to your brother.

40:36.262 --> 40:38.800
Thank you, detective, Mr. Castle.

40:38.801 --> 40:40.974
So what's gonna happen
to Drake's Magic Shop?

40:41.041 --> 40:43.573
Hmm. Tobias and I
were discussing that.

40:43.890 --> 40:45.497
Zalman put his life
on the line for it,

40:45.498 --> 40:47.557
so we'd like to find a
way to keep it alive.

40:47.558 --> 40:50.198
Maybe we can pull a solution
out of our collective hats.

40:51.028 --> 40:51.484
Good night.

40:51.485 --> 40:52.360
Bye.

40:53.933 --> 40:54.865
Hey, could you, uh...

40:54.866 --> 40:55.774
Oh, yeah.

40:57.153 --> 40:59.750
So... where's Esposito?

40:59.751 --> 41:02.088
Huh. Take a wild guess.
Lanie?

41:02.089 --> 41:03.847
Can you believe they still
think that none of us know?

41:03.848 --> 41:06.674
Oh, let's let 'em keep
thinking that a while longer.

41:06.675 --> 41:08.368
The bubble bursts soon enough.

41:08.369 --> 41:12.143
Not if you're in it with the right person.
Thanks. Thank you. See you.

41:17.628 --> 41:19.448
Excuse me. I need
to take this. Yeah.

41:36.932 --> 41:38.547
No. No.

41:38.548 --> 41:39.936
What I'm saying is...

41:41.563 --> 41:42.608
It's over.

41:59.412 --> 42:02.135
Heading out?
Yeah. It's late.

42:02.972 --> 42:04.257
Motorcycle boy?

42:04.771 --> 42:07.353
I really wish you would
stop calling him that.

42:07.354 --> 42:10.199
Dr. Motorcycle boy.
He's on shift tonight.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.939
I was gonna see if I could
catch the comfort food truck.

42:16.174 --> 42:17.283
You want to come?

42:18.328 --> 42:21.305
Macaroni and cheese,
warm biscuits, hot chocolate?

42:21.306 --> 42:22.532
How could I say no?

42:24.609 --> 42:26.445
Hey, I wanted to
say thanks for, um,

42:27.465 --> 42:30.261
not mentioning that article
or asking what was going on.

42:37.441 --> 42:38.453
Not a problem.

42:38.653 --> 42:48.853
