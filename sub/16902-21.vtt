08:56.469 --> 08:58.304
Donald's openin' a dojo.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.838
Mm-hmm, yeah.

08:59.905 --> 09:03.741
I'm-a teach karate
and whatnot to kids...

09:03.809 --> 09:05.343
Or whatever.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.579
Startin' a small business
is expensive!

09:07.647 --> 09:11.850
- I bet it is.
- Hey, remember this song?

09:11.918 --> 09:15.485
♪ If e'er a fair maiden
a knight chanced to see ♪

09:15.554 --> 09:19.757
♪ Astride his fair steed
to spy ♪

09:19.826 --> 09:21.059
Miss Lemon,
the contest winners are here.

09:21.127 --> 09:24.828
[gasps] My three dads!

09:24.897 --> 09:26.665
[knocking]

09:26.731 --> 09:29.500
- Are you ready to meet them?
- [whispers] Yeah.

09:29.567 --> 09:34.004
Jack, this is George Park.

09:34.071 --> 09:35.538
He's <i>Korean</i>.

09:35.606 --> 09:37.175
Oh! Okay.

09:37.241 --> 09:39.577
Welcome, Mr. Park.

09:39.644 --> 09:41.679
And, uh, this is
Fred O'Dwyer.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.047
Mr. O'Dwyer,
tell Jack the story

09:43.116 --> 09:44.448
you were telling
in the elevator.

09:44.516 --> 09:45.616
In world war II,

09:45.685 --> 09:47.885
a Kraut grenade
exploded my genitals.

09:47.951 --> 09:49.018
[mouthing "pop"]

09:49.086 --> 09:52.122
Oh. So...No children,
right?

09:52.189 --> 09:53.524
No chance.

09:53.591 --> 09:57.561
Looks like a bowl
of spaghettios down there.

09:57.629 --> 09:58.762
[mouthing words]

09:58.829 --> 10:03.597
And Jack, this is
Professor Milton Greene.

10:03.666 --> 10:05.266
Nice to meet you.

10:05.334 --> 10:07.235
[husky Jack voice]
And it's nice to meet you, Jack.

10:07.304 --> 10:09.136
[clearing throat]

10:09.204 --> 10:11.038
[normal voice] Sorry. There was
something in my throat.

10:11.106 --> 10:13.208
I'm Milton Greene.

10:13.275 --> 10:15.143
Have a seat.

10:16.277 --> 10:17.678
[mouthing words]

10:20.848 --> 10:23.418
Oh, Jenna has a photo shoot
for <i>Time Out</i> magazine.

10:23.485 --> 10:25.087
- For what?
- Um...Nothing.

10:25.154 --> 10:27.255
They're gonna name her
the funniest woman in new york.

10:27.323 --> 10:28.689
Oh. What time do they
need me there

10:28.756 --> 10:30.223
To make her seem funny?

10:30.292 --> 10:32.625
Look, I know you're upset,
but Jenna fully acknowledges

10:32.693 --> 10:34.894
That you write the deal breaker
sketches together.

10:34.962 --> 10:37.095
Yeah, we write them
<i>together.</i>

10:37.163 --> 10:39.931
She texts her gay friends while
I write till 4:00 in the morning

10:39.998 --> 10:42.667
Eating dry fistfuls
of raisin bran to stay awake.

10:42.735 --> 10:44.070
Which, by the way,

10:44.136 --> 10:46.403
Is how I'm able to ride the fart
train to work every day.

10:46.472 --> 10:48.406
Liz...Hey.

10:48.474 --> 10:49.974
This is your job.

10:50.041 --> 10:52.142
This is what you signed up for.

10:52.210 --> 10:54.177
I know.

10:54.246 --> 10:56.781
I like it when you use your
calm, reasonable dad voice.

10:56.849 --> 10:59.616
That's the voice you should
use when you tell Jenna

10:59.684 --> 11:03.321
That I'm gonna be in
that magazine with her.

11:03.389 --> 11:06.790
I'm-a save this for later.

11:06.859 --> 11:08.325
Look at that scammer.

11:08.393 --> 11:12.429
What 21-year-old
wraps up half a muffin?

11:12.497 --> 11:14.164
Hey...

11:14.231 --> 11:15.698
Kenny.

11:15.766 --> 11:18.200
Well, hello, stranger.

11:18.268 --> 11:21.371
- Do you like magazines?
- I sure like S&M magazines.

11:21.439 --> 11:24.974
S&M is my abbreviation
for super and magical.

11:25.042 --> 11:26.477
[chuckles]
Yeah, well,

11:26.543 --> 11:28.711
I'm selling magazine
subscriptions

11:28.780 --> 11:31.449
To benefit the, uh,
community center.

11:31.517 --> 11:34.019
- How many you want?
- Four?

11:34.087 --> 11:37.255
Great! That's like...
$80!

11:41.294 --> 11:43.695
I'm-a get your address
from my daddy.

11:43.763 --> 11:46.799
Oh, instead of doing it now.
Good plan!

11:46.866 --> 11:48.334
We gotta stop that guy.

11:48.401 --> 11:50.068
How can we prove to Tracy
that Donald's lying?

11:50.135 --> 11:51.502
Well, I've asked Cerie

11:51.570 --> 11:53.204
To look into getting a copy
of his birth certificate.

11:53.271 --> 11:54.672
No. You can't get someone
else's birth certificate.

11:54.740 --> 11:56.173
I know, because I've been
trying to steal

11:56.240 --> 11:57.341
My dead neighbor's identity

11:57.409 --> 11:58.909
Because sometimes
it feels like too much,

11:58.976 --> 12:01.511
And maybe daddy just needs
to get in the car and drive.

12:01.579 --> 12:03.179
We gotta catch Donald
in a lie.

12:03.246 --> 12:04.748
What else
do we know about him?

12:04.815 --> 12:06.382
Well, he claims
to know karate.

12:06.449 --> 12:08.018
That's gotta be bogus.

12:08.085 --> 12:09.987
But how do you test someone's
knowledge of karate?

12:10.053 --> 12:12.821
I know karate.

12:18.595 --> 12:21.163
Um, so gentlemen,

12:21.230 --> 12:23.698
Is there any history of mental
illness in your family?

12:23.767 --> 12:25.700
[laughs]
Oh, don't get me started.

12:25.768 --> 12:28.538
My cousin
killed everyone at his job.

12:28.605 --> 12:30.705
How 'bout you, Milton?

12:30.772 --> 12:32.573
No, no, the Greenes
are sharp as a tack,

12:32.642 --> 12:34.108
Right to the end.

12:34.176 --> 12:36.243
Which makes the end
all that much more terrifying.

12:36.311 --> 12:37.878
My father died screaming.

12:37.946 --> 12:41.114
oh. Greene--
that's sort of a vague name.

12:41.181 --> 12:46.020
You meet a lot of other Greenes
at your...Church?

12:46.087 --> 12:47.187
Christmas?

12:47.254 --> 12:48.956
We're agnostic
secular humanists.

12:49.024 --> 12:50.357
Sure, but if you
had to pick...

12:50.426 --> 12:52.526
Is that you and Tom Delay?

12:52.594 --> 12:55.196
Uh, yes.
"The Hammer" is a hero of mine.

12:55.263 --> 12:56.764
- [snorts]
- I-I'm sorry.

12:56.830 --> 12:59.599
Did you just snort at our former
house majority leader?

12:59.666 --> 13:01.700
He was never my house
majority leader.

13:01.769 --> 13:03.235
You've got to be
kidding me.

13:03.303 --> 13:06.272
Here's Tom Delay's legacy
to the United States:

13:06.339 --> 13:09.307
Raping the environment,
waging an illegal war--

13:09.376 --> 13:12.111
History will validate
the liberation of Iraq.

13:12.179 --> 13:13.713
I was talking about
the war on drugs.

13:13.780 --> 13:17.817
Not to mention the hypocrisy
of espousing family values

13:17.885 --> 13:19.951
While demonizing single mothers.

13:20.019 --> 13:21.653
What would you know
about single mothers?

13:21.721 --> 13:23.155
What would you know
about families?

13:23.222 --> 13:25.357
I will not be spoken to
this way.

13:25.425 --> 13:27.493
I'm a contest winner.

13:27.559 --> 13:29.261
And a professor
at Bennington College.

13:29.328 --> 13:31.564
[laughing]
Oh...Bennington!

13:31.632 --> 13:32.965
How's that going,
teaching all those kids

13:33.032 --> 13:34.400
That couldn't
get into Middlebury?

13:34.467 --> 13:35.934
- How dare you!
- How dare you.

13:36.002 --> 13:37.768
You are a huge
disappointment to me.

13:37.836 --> 13:40.604
I do not understand why
we're yelling at each other,

13:40.672 --> 13:42.972
But I am not accustomed
to losing an argument.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.908
So you know what?
Screw you.

13:45.976 --> 13:48.376
And your <i>fakakte</i> contest.

13:48.444 --> 13:49.505
[door slams]

13:49.540 --> 13:50.969
Oh God no!

13:51.478 --> 13:51.986
{ Advertisement }

13:54.270 --> 13:56.470
Looking beautiful.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.704
Uh...I'm gonna
get some tape.

13:59.081 --> 14:00.873
Oh, my God, Liz.

14:00.908 --> 14:03.242
I'm so glad that
you've insisted on doing this.

14:03.310 --> 14:06.479
Yay! Well, thank you
for so graciously including me.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.114
I know this kind of thing is
all that you have in your life.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.415
Aw!

14:11.317 --> 14:12.651
Wait--what is that?

14:12.720 --> 14:15.019
Bellafonte,
what is that stuff?

14:15.088 --> 14:16.588
I just thought
that for some of the pictures,

14:16.656 --> 14:18.790
It'd be fun
if we got a little wacky.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.091
[giggles]
Okay, look.

14:20.158 --> 14:21.859
I know you've never
done this before,

14:21.927 --> 14:23.996
But I had to learn the hard
way--don't use the props.

14:24.062 --> 14:26.363
They always try to get you
to take one funny photo.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.932
That's always the one they use,
and you look like an idiot.

14:28.999 --> 14:30.799
That's always
the one they use, huh?

14:30.868 --> 14:31.800
Don't do it.

14:31.868 --> 14:33.268
Just open your mouth a little

14:33.336 --> 14:35.004
And try to look like
Lindsay Lohan.

14:35.071 --> 14:36.638
Great.
Fabulous, ladies.

14:36.706 --> 14:38.006
You look beautiful.

14:38.075 --> 14:40.608
Now, Jenna, catch the chicken.

14:40.677 --> 14:42.378
Nice try, pal.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.480
Not my first time
on the merry-go-round, chief.

14:44.549 --> 14:45.648
Not gonna do it.

14:45.717 --> 14:47.149
Staying like this--
serious and horny.

14:47.217 --> 14:48.384
I don't know.

14:48.450 --> 14:52.219
With the chicken,
it could make a great cover.

14:52.286 --> 14:54.755
I'll hold the chicken.

14:57.693 --> 14:58.893
[laughing] Great.
That's great.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.294
That's so great.

15:00.363 --> 15:02.563
Now act like
the chicken farted.

15:02.630 --> 15:05.965
Yes, yes.
You're the funny one.

15:06.034 --> 15:08.403
Great!
That's so great.

15:10.938 --> 15:12.839
I am Lutz.

15:12.908 --> 15:15.508
I understand you study
the art of the empty hand.

15:15.576 --> 15:19.146
I challenge you to <i>kumite!</i>

15:19.214 --> 15:21.213
Hah! Whhhh! Eeee! Whooo.

15:23.149 --> 15:26.084
Front kick.
Front kick!

15:26.152 --> 15:27.986
Uh, uh, escape kata!

15:28.053 --> 15:29.688
Ow!

15:29.756 --> 15:31.855
Pete, Liz, I see you!

15:31.923 --> 15:32.890
Help mommy's baby!

15:32.957 --> 15:36.095
[sobbing]
help mommy's baby!

15:37.731 --> 15:39.397
Jack, what did you
say to Milton?

15:39.465 --> 15:42.001
If Cornel West weren't speaking
at the new school tonight,

15:42.068 --> 15:43.336
I think he would have left.

15:43.404 --> 15:44.971
He should leave.

15:45.038 --> 15:46.306
It's exactly what
I was afraid of.

15:46.373 --> 15:47.941
More family,
more aggravation.

15:48.008 --> 15:50.509
- I'm walking away.
- Why? He's just like you.

15:50.577 --> 15:52.311
He's smart and worldly,

15:52.378 --> 15:55.179
And he's really good
at making fun of my shoes.

15:55.247 --> 15:56.848
When he saw these,

15:56.915 --> 15:58.950
He asked me when my cult
was committing suicide.

15:59.017 --> 16:00.250
Okay, that's pretty good.

16:00.318 --> 16:02.019
But Milton Greene and I
are nothing alike.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.754
I have one scotch
with the guy,

16:03.822 --> 16:06.290
And it devolves into a screaming
match about tom Delay.

16:06.357 --> 16:08.626
So you have a couple drinks,
fight about politics,

16:08.694 --> 16:11.195
And then you take it personally
when he doesn't agree with you?

16:11.262 --> 16:13.563
That's called
having a dad, Jack.

16:13.632 --> 16:14.699
Don't walk away.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.199
I think you'll regret it
if you do.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.569
Or I could regret
telling him.

16:18.636 --> 16:21.471
Why would a man like that
want <i>me</i> as a son?

16:21.540 --> 16:23.105
Maybe he won't.
I don't know.

16:23.173 --> 16:24.273
But so what?

16:24.341 --> 16:25.642
Yeah, it'd hurt,

16:25.710 --> 16:27.611
But then you'd just go back
to being Jack Donaghy,

16:27.679 --> 16:28.811
Which is pretty cool.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.780
Thank you.
My hair just dries like this.

16:31.848 --> 16:35.751
Exactly. Or you tell him,
and he starts crying

16:35.819 --> 16:37.988
And you hug,
and then you have a dad.

16:38.054 --> 16:39.588
Which is pretty cool too.

16:39.655 --> 16:40.922
- Maybe you're right.
- I am right.

16:40.991 --> 16:42.959
Either way,
you're gonna be okay.

16:43.026 --> 16:45.264
One of those two things
is gonna happen.

16:45.329 --> 16:47.998
There's no weird third thing.

16:48.064 --> 16:49.998
Thank you, Liz.

16:50.066 --> 16:52.200
By the way,
did the medical supply store

16:52.270 --> 16:55.504
Where you bought those shoes
have any...Women's stuff?

16:55.572 --> 16:58.508
[chuckles]

17:02.212 --> 17:05.280
Well, Donald obviously
knows karate.

17:05.348 --> 17:08.248
We still don't know how old
any African-Americans are.

17:08.318 --> 17:10.151
Oh, that reminds me.

17:10.219 --> 17:12.488
I got the birth certificate
that you asked for.

17:12.555 --> 17:13.689
You did? How?

17:13.756 --> 17:15.290
The guy at the place
just gave it to me.

17:15.359 --> 17:19.361
You will get old someday.

17:19.429 --> 17:21.496
[gasps]

17:21.563 --> 17:23.163
Tracy, stop writing
that check.

17:23.231 --> 17:25.833
He's 40.
Don't sign that.

17:25.900 --> 17:30.837
Okay. That was to put
in Dotcom's birthday card.

17:30.905 --> 17:33.473
But you're right...
The card is enough.

17:33.541 --> 17:37.310
Tracy...
Donald is older than you are.

17:37.378 --> 17:40.179
He's scamming you!

17:40.247 --> 17:42.348
I know.

17:42.416 --> 17:43.883
I'm sorry, what?

17:43.950 --> 17:45.585
Liz Lemon,
I may hug people too hard

17:45.651 --> 17:48.688
And get lost at malls...
But I'm not an idiot.

17:48.756 --> 17:50.357
Then why are you giving him
all this money?

17:50.425 --> 17:51.358
When Donald came to me,

17:51.427 --> 17:53.026
He was a fast-talking charmer

17:53.093 --> 17:54.727
From the wrong side
of the track.

17:54.796 --> 17:56.297
He reminded me of someone,
Liz Lemon--

17:56.364 --> 17:59.533
John Travolta's character
from <i>Grease!</i>

17:59.601 --> 18:00.800
And me.

18:00.868 --> 18:03.336
So giving Donald money
is what--charity?

18:03.404 --> 18:04.871
Call it what you want.

18:04.940 --> 18:07.075
But in the last three years,

18:07.141 --> 18:09.108
Donald has gone
from scamming celebrities

18:09.177 --> 18:11.143
To being a small business
owner.

18:11.211 --> 18:13.046
The dojo is real?

18:13.113 --> 18:15.215
And the community center
is thriving.

18:15.283 --> 18:17.682
You know Kenneth's $80
bought a chess set

18:17.750 --> 18:19.251
<i>And</i> a crate of condoms?

18:19.319 --> 18:21.220
Those kids are really lucky.

18:21.288 --> 18:22.255
[knocking]

18:22.322 --> 18:23.856
Hey.

18:23.925 --> 18:27.226
Daddy, do you wanna
go uptown and see the dojo?

18:27.293 --> 18:30.396
Or should I say the Tracy Jordan
institute for black karate?

18:30.463 --> 18:31.729
[whimpers]

18:31.798 --> 18:34.567
That's what y'all namin' it?

18:37.070 --> 18:39.238
Thank you, son.

18:39.307 --> 18:41.907
Thank you.

18:48.981 --> 18:51.384
Well, I hope you're
happy with your cover.

18:51.451 --> 18:52.617
Oh, boy.

18:52.685 --> 18:54.819
They went with birthing
the chicken on the toilet.

18:54.887 --> 18:56.722
Why didn't you
listen to me?

18:56.790 --> 18:58.056
Because I thought
you were just trying

18:58.125 --> 18:59.625
to keep me from being
in the magazine.

18:59.692 --> 19:01.795
I was just trying to keep you
from embarrassing both of us.

19:01.861 --> 19:04.129
Well, you wanted attention.
You got it.

19:04.196 --> 19:07.098
I hope you're happy.

19:09.601 --> 19:12.103
I'm on the cover!

19:12.169 --> 19:14.138
And this is
the backstage area.

19:14.206 --> 19:16.440
Kenneth, I'd like to speak
with Mr. Greene for a moment.

19:16.507 --> 19:19.409
And as head of this tour,
I'm going to deny your request.

19:19.476 --> 19:21.545
Uh, Milton...

19:21.613 --> 19:24.313
Do you remember a woman
named Colleen Donaghy?

19:24.381 --> 19:26.415
Sure.

19:26.483 --> 19:28.616
[laughs] That takes me
back a few years.

19:28.683 --> 19:32.354
- 1958?
- Yeah, right.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.991
She rented me a room
when I was a graduate student.

19:35.058 --> 19:37.659
One month I couldn't pay,

19:37.727 --> 19:41.896
So she said maybe there was
something else I could give her.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.499
- So I gave her my radio.
- [softly] Oh.

19:44.566 --> 19:47.735
And a couple of weeks later,
we got drunk and had sex.

19:47.803 --> 19:49.237
Uh...Okay.

19:49.304 --> 19:53.007
I'm Jack Donaghy,
colleen's son.

19:53.075 --> 19:55.743
I was born around
nine months after that.

19:55.811 --> 19:57.278
Oh, my God.
Wha--wait a minute.

19:57.345 --> 20:00.349
I-is this contest
some <i>Mamma Mia</i> thing?

20:00.416 --> 20:04.152
Milton...

20:04.221 --> 20:07.021
I'm your son.

20:09.892 --> 20:12.961
Oh...Of course you are.

20:13.028 --> 20:16.432
I should have known
the minute I saw you.

20:16.498 --> 20:18.333
I have a son!

20:18.402 --> 20:20.168
A beautiful son!

20:20.236 --> 20:21.803
And I have a dad!

20:21.873 --> 20:23.638
Fate has brought us
together, Jack.

20:23.706 --> 20:26.608
You opened a whole new
chapter in my life!

20:26.676 --> 20:28.443
Yeah. Isn't it amazing?

20:28.512 --> 20:30.479
Oh, you don't know
the half of it!

20:30.547 --> 20:33.549
I need a kidney!

20:33.617 --> 20:35.852
[laughing]
Oh, God!

20:35.920 --> 20:39.684
This is so great!
[laughing]
