MOON 47th - MINING OPERATION IN
THE OUTERZONE.

00:31.940 --> 00:36.244
BY THE YEAR 2038 ALL NATURAL RESOURCES
ON EARTH HAVE BEEN DEPARTED.

00:36.244 --> 00:39.612
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS HAVE TAKEN
CONTROL OF THE UNIVERSE

00:40.628 --> 00:43.757
NOW A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAR RAGES.
RIVAL COMPANIES FIGHT DEADLY BATTLES

00:44.371 --> 00:48.036
OVER PRICELESS MINING PLANETS
IN OUTER SPACE.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.700
... we are under the attack
by Pirites.

01:59.700 --> 02:03.800
The final analysis of systems shows that their
jets of robots can be controlled.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.800
I repeat
the Pirites are robots.

02:13.100 --> 02:16.800
Do you read me?
We all will be killed.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.700
Mayday...mayday.

02:26.700 --> 02:29.800
At least we finally know
what we are dealing with.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
- Any survivors?
- No chance.

02:32.200 --> 02:35.500
So what's been done about it ?
Pirites captures all our moons after another

02:35.800 --> 02:38.900
- ...and we are going broke.Those bastards...
- I've warned you before.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.000
We can't defend the mining operation
if you keep cuting my budget!

02:42.200 --> 02:46.900
We're not a military operation like Pirite.
Our money are spent to research, equipment...

02:47.200 --> 02:51.300
There are no alternatives left.
We have to defend ourselves, do we not ?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.300
We're listening.

02:56.900 --> 03:00.000
They've already captured
51, 46 and 47.

03:00.500 --> 03:05.500
The only one left up there
is Moon 44.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.200
He will certainly
Pirites next target.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.400
It's ironic we already had
a working defence system up there,

03:12.500 --> 03:13.800
and you cancelled it.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Because too many pilots
got killed in training.

03:16.200 --> 03:19.600
Those pilots we are having the navigate
an extreme weather conditions.

03:19.800 --> 03:24.200
- Pirite obviously manage to deal with that.
- And so with my men.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.400
Two weeks ago I've send up
a new group of navigators.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.900
They will make a hell of lot safer
for the Pirites.

03:29.100 --> 03:34.300
Look, Stevens. Your "navigators"
are barely after teens.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.500
- They are kids.
- I've tested them, they are the best.

03:38.800 --> 03:43.900
What I'm having a hell of a time finding pilots
no one wants to volunteer for the outerzone anymore.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.000
We had to send up prisoners.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.100
Convicts ? You're puting our prime assets
in the hands of prisoners...

03:50.400 --> 03:54.400
- teens and computer freaks?
- Baker is right.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.500
As usual.

03:56.800 --> 04:01.500
He can't afford to take chances.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.600
But I already certain precautions.

04:05.400 --> 04:11.200
Let me remind everyone what is state here
is not Moon 44,

04:11.400 --> 04:14.000
but our mining shuttles.

04:14.200 --> 04:18.200
Without them, Galactic Mining is finished.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.800
That's why I've ordered the station
commander of Moon 44

04:21.000 --> 04:25.600
to launch all shuttles
at the first sign of attack.

04:25.800 --> 04:30.200
You gave him control of the shuttles?
But what about the crew?

04:30.400 --> 04:34.300
Mr Chairman, their only chance to escape
is sitting a ride on the shuttles.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.700
I'm afraid that's impossible.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.300
They have to stay
and fight.

04:39.500 --> 04:44.000
- But they will be masacred.
- We're all making our sacrifices.

04:44.200 --> 04:49.000
Or would you prefere to encourage Pirite,
to go on and on with this take over ?

04:54.500 --> 04:56.600
Ladies and Gentlemen...

05:13.600 --> 05:14.300
Mr Chairman ?

05:14.300 --> 05:17.700
Moon 44. We have a problem.

05:21.400 --> 05:26.100
Contact the Internal Affairs imediately.
Get me their best agent.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.300
No one gonna go in a mission like that.
It would be a suicide.

05:29.500 --> 05:33.900
Even an Internal Affair's agent
doesn't need to know everything.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.500
Yes, sir.

07:12.400 --> 07:16.400
Welcome to Western...a Galactic Mining

07:21.300 --> 07:27.500
I repeat: All
55B8 passengers are asked,

07:27.800 --> 07:29.700
leaving the space shuttle...

07:29.900 --> 07:33.300
the security checkpoint B2
to happen.

07:35.700 --> 07:39.200
- Rising shine, we're at home.
- Fuck you !

07:39.400 --> 07:44.400
You know something, Lieutenant?
You've got a real atitude problem.

07:50.600 --> 07:54.600
Unlock me.
Or you gonna have a real problem.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.100
Fuck up and I'll take you
with me, I swear it.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.900
... go to control Item 7.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.114
Dad, look !

08:12.641 --> 08:14.834
- Come on !
- But that man...

08:16.700 --> 08:20.400
- Felix Stone.
- I.A. I know who you are.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.400
Who is he?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.400
Well, he is
Lieutenant Gallagher.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.700
You guys are never change.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.800
It was not even loaded?
You're crazy !

08:46.000 --> 08:48.900
You're nuts,
God damn bull you pig!

08:49.200 --> 08:53.400
Someone should kaltmachen Register!
Can you hear me?

08:55.800 --> 08:59.200
- You really enjoy this sheet, don't you ?
- No.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.900
Galactic Mining wants you enjoy your staying

09:07.213 --> 09:10.053
but reminds you to be cautious

09:10.843 --> 09:15.555
do not reveal the nature or location
of your asignments to strangers.

09:17.425 --> 09:23.784
Report any of irregularities or suspicions
to the Internal Affairs.

09:38.600 --> 09:42.100
THE YEAR 2038
GALACTIC MINING HEADQUARTERS

09:46.800 --> 09:49.800
You were full three months
out there.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.500
- How did you find and catch him?
- What's the difference ? I've got him.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.600
- What is this?
- Keep back for your next job.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.500
That you probably would have gladly.

10:38.500 --> 10:41.000
Stone, this is Stevens from Headquarter
by the central administration.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.600
We wannna see you immediately
when you arrive.

10:43.900 --> 10:50.400
We have asked the Internal Security
your immediate effect exemption.

10:50.479 --> 10:51.959
This is a top priority.

10:54.800 --> 10:59.400
Hunters have Flight Academy
With awards.

10:59.700 --> 11:03.200
- Have you been flown?
- No.

11:03.300 --> 11:07.400
Why... ?
Why did you quit the military ?

11:08.700 --> 11:10.700
I'm not very good in taking orders.

11:10.900 --> 11:13.100
Then what made you
join the Internal Affairs?

11:13.500 --> 11:15.000
It gives me a free hand there.

11:15.100 --> 11:19.900
Why then have several applications
on early dismissal?

11:20.100 --> 11:23.100
I've arrested and locked them up
they let it get out again.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.700
But your prisons
they only make things worse.

11:25.900 --> 11:30.100
- There is no way to change people.
- Then they have to do something about it.

11:30.500 --> 11:35.200
You wanna quit for ...
classical literature to study.

11:36.100 --> 11:38.900
What's is all about ?
Is this an interrogation?

11:39.100 --> 11:43.500
No ! We have a proposition
for you, mr Stone.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.900
A critical assignment.
You'll completed

11:48.000 --> 11:53.300
and we guarantee the
early cancellation of from your contract.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.700
You can then do what you want.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.400
I'm  listening.

12:05.500 --> 12:09.100
Moon 44. The most important
mining operation in the galaxy.

12:09.400 --> 12:13.300
Over 100 mining shuttles
operate there.

12:14.500 --> 12:18.300
Robots, machineries worth billions.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.400
They dig on the clock, fill up...

12:22.600 --> 12:28.700
millions of tones of all material back here
and we're converting into solid fuel.

12:28.900 --> 12:31.800
It is our prime income.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.300
Our pride.

12:35.200 --> 12:40.000
Recently, mr. Stone,
very strange things happened.

12:41.200 --> 12:44.400
Someone tempered
without very existence...

12:45.100 --> 12:47.300
two of these magnificent shuttles
dissapared in transit.

12:47.500 --> 12:51.100
We thought that it is
a technical defect.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.200
But to our surprise ...

12:54.400 --> 12:57.700
we learned
that they were stolen.

12:57.900 --> 13:04.200
We have reliable information from
a navigator station from Moon 44.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.800
- His name is Tyler.
- Looks young.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.500
We want you to go up
and investigate.

13:10.700 --> 13:13.400
- Where's the catch?
- Catch ? There is no catch.

13:13.600 --> 13:18.200
But you have to go undercover
in the group of prisoners

13:18.400 --> 13:21.300
they're in training
to become fighter pilots.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.700
- Are you expecting an attack ?
- Certainly not.

13:24.900 --> 13:27.800
It is nearly a routine training exercise.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.200
Well, mr. Stone,
do we have a deal ?

13:47.900 --> 13:51.000
Jake O'Neal,
Scooter Bailey! Come out!

13:51.200 --> 13:53.000
If time
that we get rid of you!

13:53.200 --> 13:56.500
Los Haggerty,
moving your black ass!

13:56.800 --> 13:59.400
Come on, move out !

13:59.600 --> 14:01.900
- See you!
- Come on, let's do it!

14:02.100 --> 14:07.300
All right, fall me!

14:17.800 --> 14:20.500
You asshole, you think
you hit a jackpot!

14:20.800 --> 14:24.200
That will be determined
no holiday!

14:24.400 --> 14:28.800
You gonna lick my stick
to get in here again !

15:13.900 --> 15:17.100
You are clear to land.

16:04.800 --> 16:08.400
Don't push me!

16:49.600 --> 16:51.900
Welcome to Moon 44.

16:52.200 --> 16:56.100
One of Galactic Mining
valuable resources,

16:56.400 --> 16:59.200
for solid fuel. The output for a year
amount is 1.7 million ...

16:59.800 --> 17:01.900
Do you know this guy ?

17:07.599 --> 17:12.300
- Lewis, who is the Einstein ?
- I've never saw him before.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.200
Galactic Mining wish
you a nice stay.

17:30.800 --> 17:34.100
Approaching base.
ready to open doors.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.900
Let's go.

17:58.400 --> 18:03.200
- The new pilots are here.
- No, man, finally new customers.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.800
- You're sick ! Do you know that ?
- Thank you !

18:10.000 --> 18:14.800
Hey, highly with you!
Fresh meat has arrived!

18:16.300 --> 18:19.300
How are you today, Alfred ?

18:30.600 --> 18:33.200
What? Prisoners?

18:34.400 --> 18:36.900
Hold it !

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Regard!

18:45.700 --> 18:50.200
My name is Sykes.
I am your training sergeant.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.300
Before you, men,
got in trouble with the law

18:52.500 --> 18:54.400
some of you were pilots.

18:55.500 --> 19:00.300
The company is giving you a chance to
reduce your prison sentence.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.800
I think this is very nice of them.

19:03.500 --> 19:07.900
Do exactly as you are told
and you are leave here free men.

19:08.100 --> 19:14.400
Screw up and you'll be send back to prison
for to remain into carceration.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.600
Jake O'Neal.

19:21.600 --> 19:25.600
A very serious boy.
Stealing military jets.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.400
- Murder one.
- Self defence.

19:29.200 --> 19:33.700
Is that so ? Do you really think
that I care ?

19:39.300 --> 19:42.200
Put that damn cigarette out !

19:45.700 --> 19:51.000
Well, mr. Stone. I see that you
were an ex fighter pilot.

19:52.300 --> 19:56.100
Refuse the orders.
Insubordination.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.800
Are you some kind of tough guy ?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.100
- Maybe.
- Shut up !

20:03.300 --> 20:05.600
Now you listen to me, sheet head !

20:05.800 --> 20:10.100
And you listen good, I've been hold
my breath for a long time for somebody like you.

20:10.300 --> 20:13.200
Do you have anything to say
about that ?

20:14.200 --> 20:17.800
Answer me when I talk to you.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.700
I think you got me confuse
with somebody you take you serious.

20:20.900 --> 20:23.700
Shut up, god damn it
until you piece me off !

20:23.900 --> 20:28.400
- Man has got the death wish.
- Nu. The man got balls.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.800
I does not need any boots,
what I need to fuck.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.200
Hey, great!

21:01.500 --> 21:04.000
You can get just right!

21:06.100 --> 21:10.300
That's enough. This is your
Station commander, major Lee.

21:12.900 --> 21:16.000
May I talk to you, major?

21:17.700 --> 21:21.900
- Bring it to the room mate.
- Yes. You've heard it!

21:22.100 --> 21:24.000
Why send the Company
our prisoners?

21:24.300 --> 21:27.400
Welcome to the real world.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.700
Listen, it's a company decision.

21:30.100 --> 21:32.800
Prisoners
are cheaper than pilots.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.300
Our lives depend
of these people !

21:35.700 --> 21:40.000
- It was not my decision.
- But how can you accept that ?

21:40.900 --> 21:45.700
You should just take it easy.
Everything is gonna work out ok.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.900
Sergeant!

21:53.300 --> 21:54.700
Sir?

21:55.200 --> 21:58.300
Put Stone
on the first training flight.

21:58.500 --> 21:59.900
With pleasure.

22:02.800 --> 22:05.300
Hi ! Welcome
to Moon 44.

22:05.500 --> 22:08.200
- My name is Tyler.
- Shit !

22:08.400 --> 22:11.400
We only have one
air conditioning in the back.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.800
Great.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.800
Hi. On good cooperation.
My name is Tyler.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.500
Apparently, I have
somehow ceased to exist.

22:29.100 --> 22:31.900
- You've asked you not too much?
- Come on, pretty boy!

22:34.000 --> 22:35.700
Did you missed me ?

22:36.000 --> 22:40.200
Hey, kid ! Don't worry, Scooter is
a music lover. Just like you.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.600
What you stare at me so?
Get out the rat out of here !

22:43.800 --> 22:46.700
Scooter is particularly
to brass band music.

22:52.100 --> 22:59.100
Hey, fighter pilot. When you read me a few
Good night stories? Yes?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.400
Hey! What are you doing there?!

23:02.600 --> 23:05.400
Say this monkeys,
this is my bunk!

23:05.700 --> 23:07.900
War times, buddy. Was.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.600
You think you are pretty tough ?

23:14.400 --> 23:19.000
Well, we'll see the tough yard.
Wait the end of the week. If you're still alive.

23:20.100 --> 23:23.700
Are you threatening me, propeller head ?

23:24.100 --> 23:27.000
- I am just telling you the facts.
- Hey !

23:27.200 --> 23:29.400
What facts ?
What's going on ?

23:29.600 --> 23:34.600
- Serge, The steal our bunks.
- Your bunks ? This is not a Scout camp!

23:34.900 --> 23:36.600
Where is our fighter pilot?

23:44.500 --> 23:46.400
I'm talking to you.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.800
Congratulations.
You've got the first training flight.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.500
Good luck.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.400
Stone, report to the airplane.

24:22.100 --> 24:24.800
What are you waiting for, mr Stone?

24:30.900 --> 24:32.900
Have a nice flight !

24:41.100 --> 24:43.900
Prepare for take-off.

24:53.900 --> 24:56.800
Yes, give me again
the coordinates.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.500
B32-X.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.300
Full ready to talk.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.100
More to the left.

25:22.900 --> 25:25.400
Gentlemen, step this way, please !

25:28.100 --> 25:32.400
Ok, now listen up. Stay cool, concentrate,
you just let Tyler take care of rest.

25:35.800 --> 25:39.900
- I just try ...
- Attempt the red button.

25:40.100 --> 25:43.100
- With the start.
- The red switch.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.900
I am impressed.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.700
Okay. Listen up !

25:54.100 --> 25:55.500
Our defence system is based ...

25:55.700 --> 25:58.600
on the perfect interraction
between pilot and the navigator.

25:58.700 --> 26:00.900
Both have a unit.

26:01.100 --> 26:04.000
Only we risk out there
our lives.

26:04.300 --> 26:06.700
Your lives depends on
you listening to these guys .

26:06.900 --> 26:08.800
- Great.
- Ready?

26:09.100 --> 26:11.200
Right. Ready.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.200
I'm counting on you.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.000
Put the baby  high.

26:20.100 --> 26:21.900
Take it easy, cowboy.

26:28.100 --> 26:32.100
Now will demonstrate
what the guy really has it.

26:34.500 --> 26:37.800
Not bad.
Stay possible in the gorges.

26:38.100 --> 26:40.100
Just stay away
from the narrows of canyon.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.500
Roger.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.800
- I see nothing!
- There you have me.

26:54.100 --> 26:57.100
I am so to speak
your eyes and ears.

26:57.300 --> 27:00.000
Test, a sense
for the bird to get.

27:01.300 --> 27:05.400
Okay, good. And now left.

27:07.700 --> 27:10.300
Exactly. Stop the machine
on the level.

27:10.600 --> 27:13.700
- Okay.
- Is too low. Pull up!

27:16.600 --> 27:18.700
- Do you understand?
- Yes, but.

27:19.100 --> 27:22.600
- Watch a robot, straight ahead.
- What a robot?

27:22.900 --> 27:24.900
Up, god damn it, up !

27:26.900 --> 27:28.600
Take it easy.
Almost missed.

27:28.800 --> 27:31.400
I was a near hit.

27:37.700 --> 27:42.600
You steer on a rock wall!
Put the box steeply up!

27:46.900 --> 27:48.200
Uh, forget it.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.400
- Forget it, just let it fall.
- Let it fall ?

27:53.600 --> 27:55.500
Do it now !

28:05.200 --> 28:09.500
Good. Slow down a bit. You
flying straight into a dead end.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.100
Slow down a bit !

28:11.300 --> 28:15.500
- You must listen to his command !
- Listen to what he tells you!

28:18.258 --> 28:19.635
Get the brake !

28:24.700 --> 28:28.300
- Well, it's looks like a dead end.
- No kidding ?

28:29.100 --> 28:32.000
- A lightning bolt marker, what?
- Return to base.

28:32.200 --> 28:35.000
- Brilliant, lady.
- Nice job, Tyler.

28:48.100 --> 28:50.400
Take next time
the cigarette lighter.

28:50.600 --> 28:51.900
At the red button.

28:52.100 --> 28:55.600
- There's also 'n ashtrays?
- What do you think, this is a limo ?

28:55.800 --> 28:58.200
I come back.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.000
Take's not so tragic.
You were not so bad.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.900
- What do you know?
- Over flying everything.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.200
What the hell
is going on up there, huh ?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.100
Only idiots do the job
still voluntary.

29:24.300 --> 29:27.000
Since they had to
you fall back on.

29:27.200 --> 29:31.000
If I would you, I would be there
failed to come where you are.

29:31.300 --> 29:34.400
- Oh, and why?
- Galactic Mining ...

29:34.700 --> 29:38.500
a commodity moon after the other
lost. Surprise attacks.

29:38.800 --> 29:41.700
Right massacre.
And no one knows who's war.

29:41.900 --> 29:44.800
They don't even know how was happened,
cause no survivors.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.500
- How do you like that?
- I don't.

29:49.700 --> 29:51.700
You're the snitch, huh ?

29:52.700 --> 29:55.000
- I'm not a snitch.
- Your name is Tyler, isn't it ?

29:55.200 --> 29:58.800
What do you know
about the hijackings ?

30:03.100 --> 30:04.400
So you are the specialist ?

30:06.100 --> 30:10.300
I have a specialist expected!
You know: Cool, inconspicuous.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.800
None of permanently
in the shit happens.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.500
Tell me what you know
and then let me alone.

30:15.700 --> 30:18.300
And what is in it for me?

30:18.500 --> 30:20.400
What do you want?

30:21.300 --> 30:25.600
I've discovered that someone
is stealing the mining shuttles, right ?

30:25.800 --> 30:29.900
I have the evidence.
That must be you but what its worth, right?

30:30.400 --> 30:32.700
- Parts we fifty-fifty.
- From what?

30:33.000 --> 30:37.300
Is it not a bonus
Kamikaze for jobs like here?

30:37.600 --> 30:38.900
Partner?

30:40.800 --> 30:42.600
Hi, guys !

30:42.600 --> 30:44.500
What's up ?

30:45.400 --> 30:49.300
Nothing, serge, I was just
debriefing Stone.

30:49.400 --> 30:52.300
- About what?
- About the training flight, sir.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.800
- Do you think you're funny, don't you ?
- No.

30:56.100 --> 31:01.000
- I mean, do you think I was funny?
- No. You're not funny, I'm funny !

31:16.100 --> 31:19.200
- Ignore him, don't show him you're scared.
- But I'm scared..

31:19.500 --> 31:24.000
We can not ignore it.
What we need to invade.

31:24.100 --> 31:25.500
And what exactly is it you wanna do ?

31:25.700 --> 31:28.600
First of all, I'm gonna try
to make some money with them.

31:28.900 --> 31:32.500
- What happened to us, but you do not care.
- Oh man

31:32.900 --> 31:34.300
Is a tough world up there.

31:34.500 --> 31:37.600
I'm just a business man trying
to survive, that's all.

31:37.900 --> 31:39.700
Hau.

31:42.500 --> 31:46.200
- You're lost ?
- No, I'm not lost.

31:46.500 --> 31:49.800
I want you to propose a business.
I am the cookie man.

31:49.900 --> 31:51.500
The medicine man.

31:51.700 --> 31:55.500
I Uppers, Downers Yellow
and Blue, everything fun.

31:55.700 --> 31:59.600
- Cookie Man got it.
- Get a hell out of here. We're not junkies.

32:01.100 --> 32:04.400
Yeah, I about
of you claims?

32:05.100 --> 32:08.100
But here it may sometimes
quite uncomfortable.

32:08.300 --> 32:12.200
Because I thought, I offer you
something for relaxation.

32:13.100 --> 32:17.700
Shit Head, get your pills out
from my face.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.000
Fighter pilot,
I've place for you!

32:27.200 --> 32:30.100
- I am talking to you!
- No, you talk with you yourself

32:30.300 --> 32:31.700
Listen up !

32:33.400 --> 32:37.300
In order to show you that "discipline"
For me, no empty concept,

32:37.500 --> 32:41.000
I've decided to honour our
new fighter pilot  with KP.

32:41.200 --> 32:45.300
And our brand mister Wisenheimer here
he's going to show him the ropes.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.800
Who, me?

32:48.300 --> 32:51.300
A week is, of course,
not punishment enough.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.700
That is why we need help

32:53.900 --> 32:59.300
our service to their friends
memorable as possible.

33:09.900 --> 33:13.600
Gentlemen.
So what are you waiting for?

34:05.400 --> 34:07.500
Well, Tyler?

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
What about when you me
bring something to eat?

34:11.199 --> 34:13.000
Yes, sir. Immediately, sir.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.100
Do not exaggeration
a little, Sykes?

34:22.300 --> 34:24.900
On this menu
he is still a long think.

34:25.900 --> 34:29.100
I'm trying to maintain discipline here.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.600
Aha.

34:30.800 --> 34:35.000
Obviously one thing, by the
You do not understand too much.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.500
Beeing a civilian ...

34:38.600 --> 34:40.600
and a woman.

34:40.800 --> 34:44.000
If you're such a great leader of men

34:44.300 --> 34:47.900
how come you're not
an officer, Sykes?

34:51.699 --> 34:53.500
I mean ...

34:54.400 --> 34:58.200
what is in your career
wrong, Sergeant?

35:16.200 --> 35:19.400
A shot from my
good old special sauce.

35:22.100 --> 35:24.200
This tastes exactly
as Mama.

35:24.400 --> 35:27.200
A few potatoes,

35:27.400 --> 35:30.100
and already he shits
Tonight the soul from the body.

35:30.300 --> 35:32.200
Evidence? These are just numbers.

35:32.400 --> 35:35.300
Bring but equal
a circular out!

35:35.500 --> 35:38.400
The mathematics is high, man

35:38.600 --> 35:43.700
That is not all. Who can
because the same in all cards?

35:43.900 --> 35:48.600
Ähh! Pass it on,
you have made it very wet.

35:48.800 --> 35:52.500
Oh, oh! What we have there?

35:52.800 --> 35:55.700
Spices! Mmm.

35:58.800 --> 36:01.800
- Where is my food?
- I'm coming !

36:02.000 --> 36:04.400
Dinner for One.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.100
Bon appetit, Serge.

37:54.900 --> 37:56.300
Crap!

37:58.000 --> 38:02.100
Tz, TZ. You want to get rid of me.
Wide, you will not come.

38:02.300 --> 38:04.400
As a professional burglar ...

38:04.700 --> 38:07.900
you just need
professional tools.

38:08.700 --> 38:12.300
Maybe I will after you
conveniently leave.

38:19.800 --> 38:22.900
Only with the rest.
It must first warm up.

38:27.300 --> 38:32.800
The head office
of course not believe in theft.

38:33.400 --> 38:38.700
Who steals already Industrial Robots
with several thousand tons of weight?

38:40.600 --> 38:45.000
But they will not disappear by
technical defect. They were stolen.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.200
Why are you so sure there?

38:47.400 --> 38:49.900
Am I the only one here
the expected?

38:50.100 --> 38:53.100
That is all simple mathematics.

38:53.300 --> 38:57.100
Mining shuttle number 112 left a week ago
no one heards

38:57.300 --> 38:58.700
Since then disappeared.

38:58.900 --> 39:01.400
The probability
that he lost

39:01.600 --> 39:05.900
is about to 1:14,959.

39:06.200 --> 39:11.800
This means that perhaps one
all 45 years disappear.

39:12.100 --> 39:16.100
- Not every month, as at present.
- What are the tax units?

39:16.300 --> 39:20.600
Each controls a mining shuttles.
Monitors work and return transport.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.400
The robots are
controlled from here ...

39:22.600 --> 39:24.600
and still not achieve its goal?

39:24.800 --> 39:27.000
Then there are traces of manipulation!

39:27.200 --> 39:28.700
- Nothing doing!
- Why?

39:28.900 --> 39:32.600
Because they are so constructed,
that this is not possible.

39:32.800 --> 39:37.000
The only thing I can calculate,
,which as next stolen.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.000
Since we have no 117th

39:39.200 --> 39:41.800
115th ..
117th Here.

39:43.700 --> 39:46.100
Allright.
Do you see this number ?

39:46.400 --> 39:50.400
That means in 24 hours, 117
stop digging and take off.

40:03.700 --> 40:07.200
Hey, Stone!
Where are you going ?

40:08.600 --> 40:10.700
Wait me, man!

40:16.400 --> 40:18.800
Well, what do you think about the matter?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.600
Stay out of this, kid,
I'll take care from now.

40:21.800 --> 40:25.000
Hey, tell me what you plan!
We are partners!

40:25.200 --> 40:27.800
I've shown you everything!
- So what?

40:31.200 --> 40:32.700
Stone!

40:35.800 --> 40:37.600
I'm scared.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.400
I've got to get out of here, man.

40:40.800 --> 40:44.200
They have virtually me
fetched from the street.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.000
The gave me the Blue
from heaven promised.

40:47.200 --> 40:50.800
And I have the same idiot
signed for two years.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.800
I didn't expect this.
I thought I

40:54.000 --> 40:58.700
I help the Company, and for that
lassen sie mich aus dem Vertrag.

40:58.800 --> 41:02.000
- Yes, possible.
- We will certainly soon attacked.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.600
I don't wanna die here.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.300
This is already
half of my premium.

41:08.600 --> 41:12.500
Man, forget the bonus!
What do you say?

41:13.000 --> 41:16.100
- Tomorrow.
- I count on you!

41:35.100 --> 41:37.000
Where are you going, pretty boy ?

41:37.300 --> 41:38.900
Leave me alone!

41:39.100 --> 41:42.300
Do you like me?
Oh, how pity.

41:42.700 --> 41:46.000
But perhaps you like
one of my friends.

41:46.700 --> 41:48.700
Let the weak sense, Scooter!

41:51.700 --> 41:53.800
For me, much too thin!

41:57.800 --> 42:02.200
In prison we have from young boys
as you can only dream of.

42:02.800 --> 42:08.400
We make a nice pretty girl.
You know yet what the like.

42:08.600 --> 42:10.600
Have I right guys?

42:11.600 --> 42:14.000
That's enough.
He's savvy.

42:14.200 --> 42:18.500
- No, he is just shy.
- Come, let him run.

42:18.700 --> 42:21.700
Why dont't you
get out of here ?

42:23.000 --> 42:26.700
- You will have to get used to turn.
- Do not go! Please!

42:26.900 --> 42:29.400
- Shut up!
- No! No!

42:39.400 --> 42:43.900
- If there's a problem, Sergeant?
- I've just saw Stone in shuttle's control!

42:44.100 --> 42:47.100
Yes, so what?
Department of Homeland Security.

42:47.300 --> 42:49.000
Holy shit.

42:52.300 --> 42:55.900
And what do we
Stone when we discovered?

42:56.100 --> 42:59.600
Then
just what invade.

42:59.800 --> 43:03.100
Accidents sometimes happen.

43:05.300 --> 43:08.000
You are not serious !
I mean,

43:08.300 --> 43:11.400
I might let me
to a theft convince

43:11.600 --> 43:15.000
but I will not murderers!
- Men, come.

43:15.200 --> 43:19.500
You have probably forgotten how the
Company umgesprungen with you!

43:19.700 --> 43:24.100
What we guard here?
The damned Förderroboter ...

43:24.300 --> 43:27.800
the Company are important
as all our lives!

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
That I think not.
- No?

43:30.200 --> 43:33.200
You know because not
what command I get?

43:33.400 --> 43:36.200
The Company has given us
but long enough shitty.

43:36.400 --> 43:40.000
It is time,
to turn the tables.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.400
Marc!

43:59.100 --> 44:01.500
What happened?

44:02.400 --> 44:04.400
Leave me alone.

44:04.600 --> 44:08.100
- Who did this to you ?
- Don't touch me !

44:09.300 --> 44:11.500
Hey, I'm sorry!

44:13.400 --> 44:15.300
God damn it!

44:25.400 --> 44:28.400
These pigs will pay for it.

44:32.500 --> 44:34.500
That I swear to you.

44:38.600 --> 44:41.300
All helicopters ready.

44:41.500 --> 44:45.700
Attention! Helicopter
prepare for training flight.

44:49.900 --> 44:53.400
We now
the practice teams.

44:53.600 --> 45:00.000
Team 1: Haggerty and Williamson.
Team 2: Niels and Dobson.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.800
Team 3: Bailey and Tahoe.

45:13.300 --> 45:15.500
Let's go through the checklist.

45:15.800 --> 45:17.200
Okay.

45:21.100 --> 45:23.600
- Number 5, Patrick.
- All the functions are checked.

45:23.700 --> 45:27.000
- All systems go?
- Work correctly.

45:34.500 --> 45:38.400
Now I will show the types of times,
what is fly.

45:39.500 --> 45:43.300
Make sure that
all weapons systems are secured.

45:43.500 --> 45:48.100
Repeat: All weapons systems
and secure.

45:48.900 --> 45:51.900
This is only a simulated attack.

45:52.900 --> 45:57.100
The weather conditions are still
the circumstances.

45:57.300 --> 46:00.400
Maximum wind speed
is 120 miles per hour.

46:01.300 --> 46:05.900
There is, above
visibility conditions.

46:08.300 --> 46:10.900
ARMED

46:38.900 --> 46:41.100
Well, what's you today?

46:41.300 --> 46:45.500
Do we both
not a good team?

46:45.700 --> 46:48.700
- What do you mean?
- Put high.

46:49.300 --> 46:51.300
- Are you ready for video games ?.
- Ready.

46:51.500 --> 46:56.300
- Keep radio contact with the ground.
- Pull the chest high.

47:04.700 --> 47:07.200
How are you today because we?

47:07.500 --> 47:10.000
Out of my leadership!
- But we are now partners!

47:10.200 --> 47:12.900
Fucking piss in
this drug freak navigator.

47:13.200 --> 47:18.300
I can business and leisure
well separated. So, pull the chest high.

47:33.300 --> 47:34.600
Direction. Regard.

47:34.800 --> 47:36.500
And  sharp right now.

47:38.300 --> 47:41.300
Have you not heard?
I said right!

47:43.200 --> 47:46.000
- Tyler, give me some news !
- Jake is right behind you.

47:46.200 --> 47:48.500
Jake O'Neal.
How are you doing so, Jake?

47:48.700 --> 47:51.100
I equal!

47:51.300 --> 47:55.400
- 'N shock prayer!
- Okay, and now up again.

47:57.200 --> 48:00.100
Rock formation, 11-3 ahead
watch out !

48:02.600 --> 48:04.200
- Great !
- Damn it!

48:04.400 --> 48:08.300
-  That's not a video game, it's serious!
- I can not shake off!

48:10.000 --> 48:12.800
Where I come from,
what do you call it fly!

48:20.200 --> 48:22.100
Pull up, man!

48:27.000 --> 48:28.800
- I've got an idea.
- Why do not hear times.

48:29.000 --> 48:33.100
- On my character, steep upward.
- Right.

48:38.400 --> 48:40.300
Now we have them!

48:41.900 --> 48:45.400
Maintenance calm the box! Still, I say!

48:50.000 --> 48:51.600
Yes, good!

48:53.200 --> 48:58.300
- If you build manure, you're it!
- Already clear. Still stop now!

48:59.800 --> 49:01.600
Steady.

49:01.800 --> 49:04.900
- Ready.
- I've got it right in the cross.

49:05.200 --> 49:06.500
Okay, Stone.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.400
- Road to hell!
- Now!

49:13.900 --> 49:16.400
- What was that?
- Get a hell out of here !

49:16.600 --> 49:19.500
- Shit !
- O'Neal, cease fire immediately !

49:19.700 --> 49:22.300
Stone, you're allright ?

49:28.000 --> 49:30.500
All clear.

49:31.000 --> 49:35.900
- Stone, are you really okay?
- The circumstances, mrs Morgan.

49:50.300 --> 49:53.400
Since when has a training helicopter
sharp ammunition on board?

49:53.600 --> 49:55.900
This is Sykes' responsibility.

49:56.100 --> 49:59.400
He is the best training sergeant
I've got.

50:00.300 --> 50:01.800
Well.

50:03.100 --> 50:07.100
And why he treated
the recruits like shit, Major?

50:09.000 --> 50:12.200
I don't know.
I have to ask him.

50:57.600 --> 50:59.300
Sykes.

51:01.400 --> 51:03.000
Yes, sir.

51:08.200 --> 51:10.400
That was wrong.
Any other suggestion ?

51:10.600 --> 51:12.900
Just be calme and down.

51:18.700 --> 51:21.600
I have an idea.

51:24.700 --> 51:27.400
You take care of next shuttle,

51:27.600 --> 51:29.700
and I'll take care of Stone.

51:32.700 --> 51:34.200
Sergeant...

51:35.600 --> 51:38.400
Do not be a face.

51:39.400 --> 51:42.400
I've got everything under control.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.600
- Slow down.
- You know I like it fast.

52:05.800 --> 52:08.200
Come on, honey !

52:08.400 --> 52:10.600
Stop this bullshits !

52:10.800 --> 52:13.800
Well, what is happening?
War I now more juice?

52:14.000 --> 52:16.900
Okay.
Do you want fast ?

52:18.700 --> 52:20.000
What you can have.

52:22.900 --> 52:25.400
Na finally! So, I've liked.

52:28.700 --> 52:32.300
Yes, that's good. Yes!

52:37.700 --> 52:40.600
Hey, hey, that's enough, baby.

52:45.200 --> 52:46.600
Hey, what should that be?

52:46.800 --> 52:48.900
Come on, come me back right now.

52:49.200 --> 52:50.600
Marc, he get the idea.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.400
Hey, what are you doing ?

52:59.300 --> 53:01.000
Slow, you little son of a bitch!

53:01.200 --> 53:03.200
I turn you around the neck!

53:05.600 --> 53:08.700
Marc, listen to so immediately,
have you heard?

53:09.200 --> 53:12.400
- Listening to you jerky ...
- Marc!

53:14.500 --> 53:17.700
Listening!
- Marc!

53:24.800 --> 53:26.700
Why?

54:01.000 --> 54:05.900
One more active revenge, and I send
you all back to prison.

54:06.200 --> 54:08.700
I am responsible
for the discipline.

54:08.900 --> 54:11.700
And I will
also condemned again!

54:11.900 --> 54:14.900
I am not your dancing
on the nose around!

54:15.100 --> 54:17.300
Excuse me, sergeant.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.900
- May I please talk to the men ?
- Who the hell do you think?

54:24.300 --> 54:26.300
They are responsible
for this incident.

54:26.500 --> 54:29.800
Had you not the air traffic control
leave about the man is still alive.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
You want me something
responsibility to tell?

54:32.200 --> 54:35.200
Then they say to me
why was armed O'Neals machine!

54:35.400 --> 54:39.400
That was your responsibility,
isn't it?

54:39.800 --> 54:43.000
- What do you say?
- Sergeant Sykes!

54:43.600 --> 54:45.500
Let them talk.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.200
Listen all.

54:49.400 --> 54:52.300
Surely none of you will
back to prison.

54:52.500 --> 54:55.800
Therefore, there is only
a single alternative.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.200
You should the
as a regrettable accident.

55:00.900 --> 55:02.100
Accident?

55:04.000 --> 55:06.300
Should the 'n joke be?

55:06.500 --> 55:08.300
Scooter was killed!

55:08.600 --> 55:11.100
Bullshit ! Everyone knows
Marc what he pleased.

55:11.300 --> 55:14.700
- Scooter the war has begun.
- You think your foot!

55:14.900 --> 55:16.600
- Cessation!
- Quit!

55:18.700 --> 55:20.200
Listen here, lady.

55:20.400 --> 55:22.400
How stupid do you think?

55:22.600 --> 55:26.700
You've killed a lot of pilots
long before we've got here !

55:26.900 --> 55:29.700
We are not come here
to die.

55:31.700 --> 55:33.900
I am sorry for Scooter.

55:35.900 --> 55:38.100
But you have to you
together.

55:38.300 --> 55:40.800
Otherwise, we
lost in the attack.

55:40.900 --> 55:44.800
Who refuses to fly
goes back to prison.

55:45.100 --> 55:48.300
Anyone who wants to continue,
should come forward.

56:43.300 --> 56:44.600
Get it done!

56:48.200 --> 56:53.100
If one of my men
again what happens, you are tuned!

56:53.400 --> 56:55.500
- Do you understand?
- Hey, Hey!

57:01.600 --> 57:05.000
When you return to heroes
want to play, I make you cold.

57:05.200 --> 57:09.600
- Have you tried it earlier.
- That was an accident.

57:17.400 --> 57:21.800
If I had really Register
want to kill you, would you dead

57:28.000 --> 57:30.100
Bring to Marc
in the cell?

57:30.300 --> 57:32.700
Please let me are.

57:32.900 --> 57:37.200
He needs a little encouragement.
He is not a bad guy.

57:37.400 --> 57:39.300
I wish him only
his music.

57:39.500 --> 57:45.900
He simply gets no bite
down without his opera music.

57:46.100 --> 57:50.900
Personally, this is nothing for me.
Scheißkunst! I get up dancing.

57:51.200 --> 57:54.300
Serge. Serge, listen to me.

57:56.100 --> 58:00.600
I promised his mother,
I will take care of him, you know ?

58:01.000 --> 58:05.300
Thank you. Thank you, Serge.
I will never forget you.

58:08.900 --> 58:11.500
Marc! I hope you're hungry!

58:17.200 --> 58:20.800
Get immediate help!
But fast!

58:21.800 --> 58:23.600
Marc!

58:24.400 --> 58:29.800
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that? Why?

59:29.900 --> 59:33.100
- We need your help.
- These are but new tones.

59:33.300 --> 59:37.300
This is not a game. Decide,
on which side you stand.

59:37.500 --> 59:41.800
- Chill, chill down, all right ?.
- What is the worst stuff you've got ?

59:42.400 --> 59:47.400
Are you turning into an addict
or something ?

59:48.000 --> 59:52.800
No. I show's this damned
Pigs, I promise you.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.600
Half of yellow
will lift you to the orbit.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:11.400
True killer. Could put
straight into the zoo.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.500
Give me two.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:18.600
- That will probably kill a horse!
- I said, I take two.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.100
Well, ts, ts, ts.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.200
This is' s job for experts, okay?

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.500
Watch this.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.600
Hi, man

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.000
Hey!

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:48.200
You play with your life,
Kleiner.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.100
- Don't you like my music?
- No!

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.500
Enjoy your meal.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.400
What the hell was that ?

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:05.000
- You make a big mistake.
- Stay out of this, right ?

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.700
Mark was like a ...
like a brother to me.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.700
And I met him
to convince the job here.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.400
What is with you, Moose?
What did you do?

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.600
Very quiet, very quiet.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.400
Very quiet.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.800
I've warned you!

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.500
- Let the fingers of him!
- Fuck off !

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:05.300
I will of the small rat
dug the ass!

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.600
Pray ever!

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.500
- I said, let him alone!
- What do you do?

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:17.400
If you want to kill him?
Then you have to kill us all!

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.500
Let him go,
otherwise get her here!

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.400
And if it does not create
then one of the guys here.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.300
You will be afraid
to eat, to breathe.

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:39.000
You will be the life
to hell.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.800
If one of you dares to
touch us,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.200
it happens the same as Moose.
Only worse.

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.100
Much worse.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.900
Mach so was never again,
mieses piece of dirt you!

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:05.700
Without this wanker
we can not fly.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.300
And I did not feel like
back to prison.

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:44.500
Man, you really zone mead.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.500
No wonder.

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:51.300
After two double whammies.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.800
Hey, man

01:03:55.700 --> 01:04:00.600
I'm really sorry. This is otherwise
not my kind is only ...

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.000
You guys can us
not so easy.

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:09.200
This reminds me
condemned in the past.

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:14.400
I was always among those who
everything had to plug it.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.300
Oh, man

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:19.500
This makes in the long run
really lonely.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:25.000
I ... I was so tired
never to belong.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:32.200
But then I came to the shooting.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:36.400
I began my self-made
Toys for sale.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.300
And suddenly I was
everybody's friend.

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:48.900
War 's great feeling.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:05.800
Access
on central computer accepted.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.000
Do you want to change the destination?

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.100
"YES"

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:28.400
New  flight coordinates.

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:36.500
Startup process is underway.

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:42.700
What do you do because, Sergeant?

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.800
Can I see the times?

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:49.000
You've seen enough.

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:55.300
Crap!

01:08:36.899 --> 01:08:39.399
Why you also must
come here?

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:43.600
Everything went according to plan,
before you're up here!

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.200
Do you think that gives me pleasure?

01:08:46.399 --> 01:08:49.800
But I'm not the idiot,
for me you do!

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:55.300
I am not a murderer!
I am training sergeant!

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:59.899
I have no desire to
take the matter alone!

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:22.700
What a hell is going on here ?

01:09:22.899 --> 01:09:25.700
Felix Stone, Internal Affairs.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.000
Since I am just
still come in time.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.399
Oh yes?

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:46.500
Why did you shoot him?
I had important questions to him.

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:49.399
What would I possibly do?

01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:00.400
Look at that.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:04.200
It must in my safe
broken into.

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.600
I will take it to me.
As evidence.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.200
I'm sorry,
I can not do that.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.600
I hope
You have a good reason.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.000
A fairly good even.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.500
In an emergency should I do with
the shuttles the start.

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:26.200
To what kind of emergency
could this act?

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.300
An attack?

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:33.000
Anything can happen.

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:37.900
- Company orders .
- Is that's so ?

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.500
Shit ! I've got crap down.

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.500
Why have you
each time the pants off?

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:56.400
Look, is the pig.

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:08.500
Four.

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:12.000
Hey, Shakespeare.

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:17.600
I had a clue
that you none of us are.

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.600
Cop?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.900
You forgot something.

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:40.700
Keep it. Read it.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:42.900
Yeah, I already did.

01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.500
Stone!

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.300
You wanted a good word
appeal for me.

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.100
Yes, sure, I will see
what I can do.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.600
Hey, kid.

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:32.000
Stay out from troubles.

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.900
Radio message, headquarters:
The highest security level.

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:14.300

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:19.400
One of our reconnaissance satellite
an enemy ship battle.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.400
Your chances are bad.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:25.400
start immediately all on the Moon
working shuttles.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:29.600
I repeat: All shuttles
to safety.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.600
- What are you doing here because?
- Do something done.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.600
Access to
central computer accepted.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.100
New  flight coordinates.

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.500
Okay. Let's see
Lee was to hide.

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:38.600
I've got it.

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.800
ENEMY AIRCRAFT APPROACHING
ON TO THE MOON

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.300
It's happen. It's an attack.

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:49.000
- Give an alarm.
- It is not responding.

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:51.700
You fix this thing,
I go to crane!

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:55.400
Stone! Thank you,
that you're back.

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:22.000
Moon 44 is under attack !

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:24.900
Go, get the battle stations !

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:32.700
Two, zero, five.
- Roger.

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:35.900
Okay, buddy, you miss lying.

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.800
Go, go! Hurry !

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.500
I have visual.

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:07.600
There are chasing drones. Robots.

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.000
They share!

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:19.000
Increase speed !

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:29.600
Steady, steady.

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:33.400
We have him!

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.300
I'm firing !

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:43.800
- What is happening?
- We are under attack.

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:46.200
- Who is out?
- Stone. - Stone?

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.600
Sure, he leaves us
but not crash.

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.000
Stone, what are you doing out there?

01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:00.100
One can you just
not alone.

01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:04.500
ALL SHUTTLES PROGRAMED
TO LIFT OFF

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.700
Hey Tyler, the mining shuttles ...

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.700
start,
someone has to stop!

01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.900
I will take over!

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.900
The second attacker
has almost reached the station.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:36.900
I have visual.

01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:48.000
Damn it!

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:58.500
- Tyler, what is happening?
- You have to lock them down.

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:02.400
- Stone, you're on your own! Give the best shot.
- Fire!

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:08.500
Stone! It was a hit!

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:17.300
Stone, you were great!

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.200
Stone? Stone!
Can you hear me?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.300
Please , Stone.

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.400
Stone, do you hear me?

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:36.900
Forget it. He was just a cop
anyway.

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.300
Just a cop ?!

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:44.300
- Come, let him.
- I make you cold!

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.600
Listens to you to fight!

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:50.200
No more fighting!

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:54.200
No more fighting, allright kid ?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.700
All the shuttles were taken off.

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.600
What? What's happening?

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:09.300
In other words, they start without us.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.900
Nobody comes here
more alive out.

01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:13.400
Damn.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:40.200
A new wave of attack hunters
approaching! Damn are many!

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:43.700
Well people, looks,
as we go to the collar!

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.900
Come on Tyler, wake up !

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.600
Come on, what is wrong with you?

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.100
Stone!

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:56.800
I am already
serious concerns about yourself.

01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.700
Once home trip!

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.700

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.100
- Oh, and Stone.

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:09.100
- Keep a cigarette for me.
- Right.

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.500
That we will never create.

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:15.000
They will be there before we
a foot from the station get.

01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:17.200
However, we have 'ne chance.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.400
We only need something ...
Time.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:31.000
I can hold them off.
Tyler Okay, bring all out here.

01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:42.200
This means that one of us

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:47.100
Well, since I am the air traffic controller,

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:51.800
I will, willy-nilly
must remain.

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.000
As the lives of so plays.

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:58.300
I wish you was.
- I can use.

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:02.000
Clear

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.700
Why do it?

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:35.200
Catch you not!

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:43.700
Go! All Man out!

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:08.300

How to restart this piece of garbage ?

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.300
Bingo!

01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:24.500
Pass!
They come from right now!

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.700
I can already watch on me.
Los, get a hell out of there !

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.900
I do that alone!
- Why do you want to get rid of me?

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.000
You probably think you could

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.700
Come on!

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.700
Oh God.
It does not need a shit.

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.000
Shut the lock!

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:12.000
It;s about time!

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:15.400
- Are you still there?
- Yes.

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.900
Yes, I'm still here.

I think they have it
apart on you!

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:26.400
The entire Squadron
comes to you!

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.400
Yes, I have it on the monitor.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:33.100
- Looks like your fan club.
- They are no fans, Cookie.

01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:36.500
This is our ticket home.

01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:39.700
Yes, take from here !

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.600
Here we go!

01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:01.700
This is reall bad trip !

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:06.200
Do you like that ?
Then come her, man!

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:38.200
Take that! Wuu!

01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:05.000
There she is !

01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:13.500
We've got company.

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:19.600
That we never!

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:21.800
WARNING !
ENEMY AIRCRAFT APPROACHING !

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:26.100
Okay, down with you,
I will yield you!

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.100
Are you kidding ?

01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:30.800
He makes no jokes.

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.800
- He's gonna drop us !
- He's gonna what?

01:28:52.174 --> 01:28:54.199
TROOP CONTAINER UNLOCK

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.300
If you all on the floor!

01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.300
Is everybody ready?

01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:43.600
Let's do not this again.
Okay?

01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:04.900
Our crew has Pirite
inflicted heavy losses ...

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:07.800
and fought until the last.
But ...

01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:12.000
at the end of the moon was taken 44.
There were no survivors.

01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:18.200
Until now there is no trace
on the whereabouts of shuttles.

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:21.700
Hundreds of huge shuttles
can not simply disappear!

01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:24.500
Have you
to a search party thought it?

01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:27.500
In the Outer Zone ?
Forget it.

01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:31.500
Our gamble didn't pay off.
We are done.

01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:34.200
Is that what you call a gamble ?

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.200
Stone! Where are the shuttles ?

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:40.200
- Where is Lee?
- He is dead.

01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:42.100
He was sold out to the Pirites.

01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:43.800
I don't believe you

01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:46.600
Your commands have him insane
Pirites straight into arms driven!

01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.400
He was my most trusted officer.

01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:53.700
- I even told you are comming!
- How could you do something stupid?

01:30:56.700 --> 01:31:01.400
What happened to our shuttles,
Mr. Stone?

01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:04.600
They are right here.
Programmed by Lee.

01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:08.800
They were in a safe place
parked. Free for Pirite.

01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:12.100
We have to thank you, mr Stone
You saved our company.

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:15.000
Wrong, Mr. Hall.
The crew has rescued you.

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:18.300
Remember them ?
These people already written off.

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:21.600
Sometimes there is 
no other choice.

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:25.300
Oh yes?
There is always a choice.

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:29.600
- You'll never get away with this.
- Don't do it !

01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:32.500
Why are you at once
so concerned about human life?

01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:37.200
I thought you only interested in
for your hard assets.

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:42.100
Please, I beg you,
Do not destroy our future.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.900
Where are you going ?

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:54.800
I guess I'm out of the job.
