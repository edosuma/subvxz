00:29.823 --> 00:31.723
Emily Copeland, 33,

00:31.725 --> 00:32.957
apparent suffocation.

00:32.959 --> 00:34.626
You said there's no signs
of forced entry, right?

00:34.628 --> 00:36.727
- No.
- What's with the window?

00:36.729 --> 00:38.621
Fire escape window was open,
but no signs of tampering.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.113
Uh-huh. And you said
her husband called it in? Where's he?

00:41.114 --> 00:42.424
Yeah. That's him
right over there.

00:42.425 --> 00:44.290
He make any statements?

00:44.291 --> 00:45.683
No, he's a little
out of it.

00:45.869 --> 00:47.407
Okay, thank you.

00:48.164 --> 00:49.630
Mr. Copeland,
Detective Reagan,

00:49.632 --> 00:51.332
this is
Detective Baez.

00:51.334 --> 00:53.533
We're very sorry
for your loss, sir.

00:55.071 --> 00:57.404
Can you tell us
what happened?

00:57.406 --> 01:00.741
Went to run some errands, and...

01:00.743 --> 01:03.944
when I came back
the door was ajar.

01:03.946 --> 01:08.048
I walked in and found her
with the pillow over her face.

01:08.050 --> 01:09.949
You see or hear
anything suspicious?

01:11.953 --> 01:15.054
I just can't believe
how peaceful she looked.

01:15.056 --> 01:17.924
Mr. Copeland, do you
know of anyone who would

01:17.926 --> 01:19.493
want to harm your wife?

01:19.495 --> 01:20.994
Anybody make any
threats to her?

01:20.996 --> 01:23.162
It was like she was sleeping.

01:24.633 --> 01:26.299
That's what it looked like.

01:30.238 --> 01:33.039
Your Honor, clearly
this is an attempt...

01:33.041 --> 01:35.875
Please, Ms. Reagan, let's hear
what Mr. Weber has to say first.

01:35.877 --> 01:37.210
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:37.212 --> 01:40.713
I fired my lawyer,
but I have retained a new one.

01:40.715 --> 01:43.883
Your Honor, if this is an
attempt to delay proceedings...

01:43.885 --> 01:45.718
So sorry I'm a few minutes late,
Your Honor.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.520
I was only officially
retained this morning.

01:47.522 --> 01:49.522
Well, I
admire your ability

01:49.524 --> 01:51.690
to hit the
ground running.

01:51.692 --> 01:53.692
Uh, you'll be requesting
a continuance?

01:53.694 --> 01:56.061
Uh, no, Your Honor, I
wouldn't want to inconvenience

01:56.063 --> 01:58.997
the court any more,
or Ms. Reagan-Boyle.

02:00.167 --> 02:01.499
I mean, Ms. Reagan.

02:01.501 --> 02:02.968
A family connection?

02:02.970 --> 02:04.169
Ex-wife.

02:04.171 --> 02:05.570
I hope that's not a problem.

02:05.572 --> 02:06.972
Well, not for me.

02:06.974 --> 02:08.705
The People have no objections.

02:08.708 --> 02:10.442
Your Honor, I'd like to request
a hearing on the admissibility

02:10.443 --> 02:11.977
of Dr. Weber's
confession.

02:11.979 --> 02:14.913
Your Honor, we're past
the pretrial stage,

02:14.915 --> 02:16.047
and Dr. Weber's
previous attorney

02:16.049 --> 02:18.082
chose not to file a motion.
I'll allow it.

02:18.084 --> 02:19.751
We already picked the jury,
Your Honor.

02:19.753 --> 02:21.619
The People should be happy
we're not pushing

02:21.621 --> 02:23.621
this murder trial
down the road.

02:23.623 --> 02:25.490
I will hear arguments tomorrow.

02:38.438 --> 02:39.463
We're good.

02:39.487 --> 02:40.852
One more time, let's
get a handshake.

02:40.853 --> 02:42.407
Thank you, Councilman.
No, no, just one more.

02:42.408 --> 02:43.964
The commissioner's running
late for his next appointment.

02:43.988 --> 02:45.477
Sorry, Steve.

02:45.478 --> 02:48.445
We got to find a better way to
get out of the handshake shot.

02:48.447 --> 02:50.647
When politicians stop
posting them as endorsements.

02:50.649 --> 02:51.982
And how do I get out of here?

02:51.984 --> 02:53.049
Just keep walking.

02:53.051 --> 02:54.518
Commissioner Reagan.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.386
May I have a word with you?
Now's not a good time.

02:56.388 --> 02:57.621
No time like the present.

02:57.623 --> 02:58.889
Uh, unless it's now.

02:58.891 --> 03:00.791
The commissioner is late
for his next appointment, sorry.

03:00.793 --> 03:04.427
No, I'm sorry, but my son
was killed in your streets!

03:10.969 --> 03:15.372
This can't be the first time
you're hearing this.

03:17.309 --> 03:20.377
His name was Charles Wayne,
and he was just 16

03:20.379 --> 03:22.472
and he's not just
a statistic to me.

03:22.496 --> 03:23.246
Or to me.

03:23.247 --> 03:24.514
Ms. Wayne, I'm
happy to arrange a meeting

03:24.516 --> 03:25.882
for you to discuss your issues

03:25.884 --> 03:27.449
with the commissioner.
When hell freezes over.

03:27.451 --> 03:28.438
All right, hold on
just a second, Garrett.

03:28.439 --> 03:29.797
Why don't you just
give me your information?

03:29.798 --> 03:32.688
My innocent boy as killed
on your streets in cold blood.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.256
That's my information.

03:34.258 --> 03:35.691
I'm sorry.

03:35.693 --> 03:37.192
Sorry doesn't cut it.

03:37.194 --> 03:39.028
I know that.

03:39.030 --> 03:40.362
We'll look into it first thing.

03:40.364 --> 03:41.897
He was some rich kid
on the Upper East Side,

03:41.899 --> 03:42.898
you'd have already
looked into it.

03:42.900 --> 03:44.766
Would've man-hunted
the killer down.

03:44.768 --> 03:46.868
Let's go, Frank.
My son was murdered,

03:46.870 --> 03:48.537
and I'm being removed
because the commissioner

03:48.539 --> 03:50.572
wants to shut me up?!

03:50.574 --> 03:52.474
Well, I'm not gonna shut up!
You hear me?!

03:52.476 --> 03:54.108
He's never gonna
shut me up!

03:54.110 --> 03:56.377
Relax!

03:59.750 --> 04:03.750

@elder_man

04:25.912 --> 04:27.845
<i>According to the doorman,</i>

04:27.847 --> 04:31.082
Mr. Copeland, you were gone
from 7:45 to 9:00.

04:31.084 --> 04:32.217
Is that right?

04:32.219 --> 04:33.785
- Sounds right.
- And when you came back,

04:33.786 --> 04:37.254
the door was open?
Well, Emily sometimes left it open.

04:37.256 --> 04:39.289
She liked
the cross ventilation.

04:39.291 --> 04:41.591
It's a safe building,
safe neighborhood.

04:41.593 --> 04:43.760
How was your relationship
with your wife, Mr. Copeland?

04:43.762 --> 04:45.628
What? How was my relationship?

04:45.630 --> 04:47.029
Yeah, were you on the outs?

04:47.031 --> 04:48.398
Did you have any issues
in your marriage?

04:48.400 --> 04:49.732
No, we weren't on the outs.

04:49.734 --> 04:50.833
We were nuts about each other.

04:50.835 --> 04:52.001
Tell you what,

04:52.003 --> 04:53.936
why don't you investigate
my wife and our marriage

04:53.938 --> 04:55.271
and let me know
what you come up with.

04:55.273 --> 04:57.306
And while you're at it,
maybe you can spare some time

04:57.308 --> 04:59.574
and look for her killer.

05:01.445 --> 05:03.879
We'll do that.

05:06.650 --> 05:09.518
Look, I know what
you're thinking.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.086
I don't work for
Internal Affairs.

05:11.088 --> 05:13.855
Right. You're just
a field associate for them.

05:13.857 --> 05:15.557
If cops follow the rules,

05:15.559 --> 05:16.958
they don't have to worry
about IAB, do they?

05:16.960 --> 05:18.092
Come talk to me when you've had

05:18.094 --> 05:19.928
more than five minutes
on the job, okay?

05:21.799 --> 05:22.997
Whoa, what're you doing?

05:22.999 --> 05:24.165
What do you mean
what am I doing?

05:24.167 --> 05:25.200
I'm starting the car.

05:25.202 --> 05:27.369
Well, we can't go anywhere yet.

05:27.371 --> 05:28.536
What do you mean?

05:28.538 --> 05:29.804
We have to follow protocol,
Officer Patimkin.

05:29.806 --> 05:31.105
Did you check
the oil in the car?

05:31.107 --> 05:33.842
The water and the antifreeze
in the radiator?

05:33.844 --> 05:35.276
The brakes and
the windshield wipers?

05:35.278 --> 05:36.845
Are you kidding me?

05:36.847 --> 05:38.579
It's clearly stated in the
patrol guide, Officer Patimkin.

05:38.581 --> 05:42.116
All part of the
driver's checklist.

06:03.705 --> 06:04.938
I was just checking
the warning devices.

06:04.940 --> 06:06.439
Looks like they're working okay.

06:14.483 --> 06:16.083
I don't get why
you're mad at me.

06:16.085 --> 06:17.351
Therein lies the
problem, Jack,

06:17.353 --> 06:19.185
your inability to recognize
you might be wrong.

06:19.187 --> 06:21.053
What did I do wrong now?

06:21.055 --> 06:24.123
There's eight and a half
million people in this city,

06:24.125 --> 06:26.593
and you're representing
the one client I'm prosecuting?

06:26.595 --> 06:29.696
I didn't seek him out.
He sought me out.

06:29.698 --> 06:31.564
And that didn't raise
an eyebrow for you?

06:31.566 --> 06:33.232
Not the most
professional move,

06:33.234 --> 06:35.234
bringing your underage
girlfriend to court.

06:35.236 --> 06:39.038
Ah. She is a lawyer.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.806
And, in fact,
she graduated Fordham,

06:40.808 --> 06:41.908
just like you and I.

06:41.910 --> 06:43.042
Good for her.

06:43.044 --> 06:44.576
And she's not underage.

06:45.613 --> 06:46.812
She's 25.

06:46.814 --> 06:48.680
Oh, great, great.

06:48.682 --> 06:50.016
Thank you for clarifying that.

06:50.018 --> 06:52.183
She's five years older
than your daughter.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.487
Unless there's
something else, Jack...

06:55.489 --> 06:56.655
No.

06:56.657 --> 06:57.989
Good.

06:57.991 --> 07:00.459
But you probably want
to keep the coat on.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.461
Must get pretty drafty up
there on your high horse.

07:11.471 --> 07:13.004
Everything okay?

07:13.006 --> 07:14.406
No.

07:14.408 --> 07:15.840
Was that...
Yes.

07:15.842 --> 07:17.809
Guess it didn't go well.

07:17.811 --> 07:19.978
No.

07:19.980 --> 07:21.879
Maybe I should come back later.

07:21.881 --> 07:24.682
What do you need, Anthony?

07:24.684 --> 07:26.250
I just got a heads-up

07:26.252 --> 07:28.252
he's adding a name
to the witness list.

07:28.254 --> 07:29.454
Officer Scott Polansky.

07:29.456 --> 07:32.389
The officer that witnessed
the confession?

07:32.391 --> 07:33.991
Yeah. He's using him
to challenge it.

07:33.993 --> 07:36.360
Can you find out why?

07:36.362 --> 07:39.363
I'm on it. And, Erin?

07:39.365 --> 07:40.965
Don't listen to him.

07:40.967 --> 07:44.168
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

07:47.239 --> 07:49.039
Let's call it what
it was, an ambush.

07:49.041 --> 07:50.874
Not an ambush if you knew
she was coming.

07:50.876 --> 07:52.309
What's that mean?

07:52.311 --> 07:54.345
It means he vetted the guest
list and he knew who she was.

07:54.347 --> 07:55.312
Is that about right?

07:55.314 --> 07:57.113
That's about right.
And I'm not sure

07:57.115 --> 07:59.816
it was necessary
to drag her out of there.

07:59.818 --> 08:00.884
And it sure wasn't
necessary to talk to her.

08:00.886 --> 08:03.052
You need to let me do my job.

08:03.054 --> 08:04.320
And who is she?

08:04.322 --> 08:06.456
Shelly Wayne.
She founded a group called

08:06.458 --> 08:08.057
Mothers United to Fight Violence

08:08.059 --> 08:10.894
with a bunch of fellow
East New York residents

08:10.896 --> 08:11.962
who lost kids, too.

08:11.964 --> 08:13.363
If it helps them
help themselves, then great,

08:13.365 --> 08:15.298
but a little cooperation
with cops

08:15.300 --> 08:16.366
might be a better way.

08:16.368 --> 08:18.134
Not a club they asked to join.

08:18.136 --> 08:19.268
Copy that, boss.

08:19.270 --> 08:21.537
Mayor's behind this.

08:21.539 --> 08:23.373
I don't know
about that, but I do know

08:23.375 --> 08:24.307
I saw it coming.

08:24.309 --> 08:25.741
How?
You get a sense.

08:25.743 --> 08:27.176
They call that
profiling now, you know.

08:27.178 --> 08:28.711
And I still call it
doing my job,

08:28.713 --> 08:30.145
but I don't have the mayor's
fingerprints on it.

08:30.147 --> 08:32.914
Well, let's just
assume the worst.

08:32.917 --> 08:34.082
Was she charged?

08:34.083 --> 08:36.784
She was issued a C-summons
for disorderly conduct.

08:36.787 --> 08:38.721
And this.

08:38.722 --> 08:40.856
She has a reputation
for that.

08:40.857 --> 08:42.289
Getting her
15 minutes of fame.

08:42.292 --> 08:43.357
You know what?

08:43.360 --> 08:44.426
Let's not do this.

08:44.428 --> 08:47.029
Let's not become
what we condemn.

08:47.031 --> 08:48.763
Now, what do you have
on her son?

08:48.765 --> 08:49.864
Charles Wayne, 16,

08:49.866 --> 08:52.367
was shot outside
the Parksdale Housing Projects,

08:52.369 --> 08:55.303
July 21, 2016, in East New York.

08:55.305 --> 08:57.739
DOA at Mercy.
Case is still open.

08:57.741 --> 08:59.641
And why is it still open?

09:00.477 --> 09:03.511
It's East New York.

09:09.052 --> 09:11.352
<i>Whoa, slow it down.</i>

09:14.658 --> 09:15.957
What?

09:15.959 --> 09:18.593
Locked him up
last year for possession.

09:18.595 --> 09:20.261
Looks like
he's at it again.

09:20.263 --> 09:23.864
Okay, wait, don't just
leave me sitting here.

09:27.670 --> 09:29.136
Hey.
Go, go!

09:29.138 --> 09:31.705
Hey! Police!

09:37.980 --> 09:39.046
Police! Stop!

09:39.048 --> 09:39.913
Move, man!

09:39.915 --> 09:43.516
Hey! Police!

09:43.518 --> 09:46.720
Ma'am, are you all right? Hey.

09:46.722 --> 09:48.622
I got a central 12, Charlie.

09:48.624 --> 09:51.224
Uh, requesting a bus
at 211 West End.

09:51.226 --> 09:54.461
Ma'am, stay put, okay?
I got help coming.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.306
Hands on the hood.

10:06.308 --> 10:07.574
Come on, I didn't do nothing.

10:07.576 --> 10:10.109
Yeah? Then why you running, huh?

10:11.345 --> 10:12.912
You got any weapons on you?

10:12.914 --> 10:15.815
Huh?

10:15.817 --> 10:18.050
DeMarcus Green.

10:19.220 --> 10:22.054
That's a whole lot of nothing
you got here, DeMarcus.

10:22.056 --> 10:24.023
You're under arrest for criminal
sale and criminal possession

10:24.025 --> 10:25.190
of a controlled substance.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.326
Just so we're clear,
this is my collar.

10:27.328 --> 10:30.895
Yeah? Here's your collar.

10:30.897 --> 10:34.199
Aah! Aah! These cuffs
are too tight, man.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.234
Police brutality!
All right, shut, shut up.

10:35.236 --> 10:36.602
Police brutality!
Put him in.

10:36.604 --> 10:38.437
I'm gonna go back and check on
the lady that he knocked down.

10:38.439 --> 10:40.105
Hey!
I'll be right back.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.107
You stay with the prisoner.
Anybody see this, help me.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.942
Man, come on, man.

10:44.811 --> 10:45.777
Excuse me.

10:45.779 --> 10:46.845
Talking to me?

10:46.847 --> 10:48.680
You didn't pick up its mess.

10:48.682 --> 10:51.382
Are you kidding me?
Who are you, the doggie police?

10:51.384 --> 10:53.652
It's a $250 fine.
But, Miss...

10:53.654 --> 10:55.386
Yeah, and if you keep arguing,
I'll make it disorderly conduct.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.456
- Patimkin.
- What?

10:58.458 --> 11:00.158
Can I talk to you for a second?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.526
Stay where you are.

11:01.528 --> 11:02.793
What is it?

11:02.795 --> 11:04.629
Where's DeMarcus?

11:08.668 --> 11:11.135
Oh, my God, I just left him
alone for a second.

11:11.137 --> 11:13.418
To enforce a pooper scooper law?
Let's go, get in the car.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.339
Let's go, get in the car!

11:22.048 --> 11:23.346
The only prints from the scene

11:23.348 --> 11:25.315
were from Emily,
Brian and their son.

11:25.317 --> 11:26.984
So maybe the killer wore gloves.

11:26.986 --> 11:29.053
M.E. say there was any DNA
on the Vic?

11:29.055 --> 11:30.220
No.

11:30.222 --> 11:32.822
Excuse me, are you
Detectives Reagan and Baez?

11:32.824 --> 11:33.890
Yes, ma'am.

11:33.892 --> 11:35.992
I'm Emily Copeland's mom.

11:37.796 --> 11:38.795
Oh.

11:38.797 --> 11:40.763
Um...

11:40.765 --> 11:41.931
- Why don't you have a seat here? Please.
- Oh.

11:41.933 --> 11:43.032
No, that's all right. Thank you.

11:43.034 --> 11:44.334
We're very sorry
for your loss.

11:45.337 --> 11:46.469
My loss.

11:46.471 --> 11:48.705
I always found that
an odd thing to say.

11:48.707 --> 11:51.007
A loss implies
there's a chance

11:51.009 --> 11:53.509
you'll eventually find
what's missing.

11:55.847 --> 11:57.246
My grandson's
only four years old,

11:57.248 --> 11:59.348
and he's going to have
to grow up without a mother.

11:59.350 --> 12:01.884
And with a father
who's a murderer.

12:03.755 --> 12:05.387
Are you telling us
that your son-in-law

12:05.389 --> 12:06.655
murdered your daughter?

12:06.657 --> 12:09.358
Emily was very upset lately.

12:09.360 --> 12:10.759
Upset how?

12:10.761 --> 12:12.194
Brian had quit his job.

12:12.196 --> 12:13.862
He wanted to open a restaurant.

12:13.864 --> 12:16.031
Like there aren't enough
of those in New York City.

12:16.033 --> 12:17.165
Emily supported him,

12:17.167 --> 12:20.102
but it was causing a big strain
on the marriage.

12:20.104 --> 12:21.036
In what way?

12:21.038 --> 12:23.504
About a week ago,
Emily came to me

12:23.506 --> 12:25.340
and asked if I would care
for Robert,

12:25.342 --> 12:27.042
my grandson...
Mm-hmm.

12:27.044 --> 12:29.377
...if-if something
were to happen to her.

12:29.379 --> 12:31.379
If I would help raise him.

12:31.381 --> 12:34.649
She give any explanation
as to why she'd be asking?

12:34.651 --> 12:38.018
She was only 33.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.787
Why would she be talking
about dying

12:39.789 --> 12:43.023
if she didn't think somebody
was trying to kill her?

12:53.007 --> 12:55.121
That's why it's called the
murder capital of New York.

12:55.145 --> 12:55.920
For your 2:00.

12:56.020 --> 12:57.420
When I started on the job,

12:57.422 --> 12:59.722
there were 109 murders
a year in East New York.

12:59.724 --> 13:01.823
We had 18 last year.
That's progress.

13:01.825 --> 13:03.491
Not so much for the 18.

13:03.493 --> 13:04.893
Right.
Anyway,

13:04.895 --> 13:06.861
I talked to the detective
investigating the son's murder.

13:06.863 --> 13:09.231
Charles Wayne was shot
by the Double Treys.

13:09.233 --> 13:10.765
And not an arrest?

13:10.767 --> 13:11.800
No. It was a drive-by.

13:11.802 --> 13:13.802
Random.
That's the thing.

13:13.804 --> 13:15.437
Charles was being initiated
into the Kings

13:15.439 --> 13:17.639
at the time of his murder.

13:20.043 --> 13:21.476
Okay.

13:21.478 --> 13:23.745
So, not so innocent
an innocent bystander.

13:23.747 --> 13:25.179
It's still a mother and her son.

13:25.181 --> 13:26.514
And it's East New York,

13:26.516 --> 13:28.583
so we're not gonna get spit
from the community.

13:28.585 --> 13:31.519
I want a sit-down
with Shelly Wayne.

13:31.521 --> 13:32.554
To what purpose?

13:32.556 --> 13:34.188
To disavow her belief
that her son

13:34.190 --> 13:35.489
was completely innocent?

13:35.491 --> 13:36.590
Got to say, boss, I
agree with Garrett.

13:36.592 --> 13:37.658
She'll just take advantage,

13:37.660 --> 13:39.026
use it to get more publicity.

13:39.028 --> 13:40.261
She is gonna have
to hear the truth,

13:40.263 --> 13:42.830
that her son was part of a gang.

13:42.832 --> 13:45.199
You want to do that, Garrett?

13:46.535 --> 13:48.735
Sid?

13:51.707 --> 13:53.907
Set it up.

14:01.817 --> 14:03.784
You realize the heap of
trouble that you're in?

14:03.786 --> 14:04.751
And me now, too?

14:04.753 --> 14:06.519
I'm sorry.

14:06.521 --> 14:08.721
You got DeMarcus' wallet?

14:09.958 --> 14:12.625
We'll probably both get
suspended thanks to you.

14:12.627 --> 14:15.428
“1512 West 116th Street”"

14:15.430 --> 14:16.929
Should we go see
if he's there?

14:16.931 --> 14:18.999
Well, we're supposed
to just call it in.

14:19.001 --> 14:21.801
Yeah, but if we find him,
then no harm no foul, right?

14:21.803 --> 14:23.469
Oh, I get it. We don't
have to go by the book

14:23.471 --> 14:25.538
when it's your skin
on the line, huh?

14:27.408 --> 14:29.041
Come on.

14:29.043 --> 14:31.677
I ran Emily Copeland
through NICB.

14:31.679 --> 14:33.646
She and Brian took out
a life insurance policy

14:33.648 --> 14:34.814
three months ago.

14:34.816 --> 14:35.915
- Both of them?
- Mm-hmm.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.149
For how much?

14:37.151 --> 14:40.419
A million dollars. Enough
to, say, start a restaurant.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.429
Come on. That gives us motive,

14:42.430 --> 14:44.162
but something still
doesn't add up for me.

14:44.164 --> 14:46.565
All I know is the last time
the suspect told the cops

14:46.567 --> 14:48.801
to find the real killer,
it ended in a Bronco chase.

14:48.803 --> 14:50.469
Yeah, but she didn't look
like she put up a fight.

14:50.471 --> 14:51.770
Maybe she was sleeping.

14:51.772 --> 14:53.705
People tend to wake up when
they're being smothered.

14:53.707 --> 14:54.807
Maybe she was drugged.

14:54.809 --> 14:56.507
Did the M.E. come back
with the autopsy yet?

14:56.509 --> 14:57.909
She started two hours ago.

14:57.911 --> 15:01.212
Okay. Well, then, maybe
the dead can settle this.

15:02.049 --> 15:03.381
Forget it, Reagan.

15:03.383 --> 15:05.350
Our tour's over.
Let's just call it in.

15:05.352 --> 15:07.385
No, there's one more place.

15:10.290 --> 15:11.522
That's him.

15:12.492 --> 15:14.158
Hey, DeMarcus.

15:19.532 --> 15:21.466
Is that marijuana
that you're smoking?

15:21.468 --> 15:25.302
Dude, there isn't even enough
for a misdemeanor.

15:25.304 --> 15:26.671
These things
are killing me.

15:26.673 --> 15:27.738
Can you get them off?

15:27.740 --> 15:30.274
Yeah, when we get
to holding.

15:30.276 --> 15:32.409
Objection, Your Honor.
We've established

15:32.411 --> 15:34.744
that the detective that
took the confession

15:34.746 --> 15:36.413
administered the Miranda rights.

15:36.415 --> 15:39.749
But the question isn't whether
or not he read them, but when.

15:39.751 --> 15:41.551
I'll allow it.

15:41.553 --> 15:44.254
You can answer
the question, Officer.

15:44.256 --> 15:46.255
He read them
after Weber confessed.

15:46.257 --> 15:47.524
But that's because
Dr. Weber confessed...

15:47.526 --> 15:49.225
That's all, no more questions.

15:53.832 --> 15:56.566
Officer Polansky,
why were the Miranda rights

15:56.568 --> 15:59.168
administered
after the confession?

15:59.170 --> 16:00.804
Weber confessed so fast,

16:00.806 --> 16:02.105
before we had a chance
to read him his rights,

16:02.107 --> 16:04.207
and once he started,
we didn't want

16:04.209 --> 16:05.641
to stop the confession
in order to read

16:05.643 --> 16:06.942
the Miranda Rights.

16:06.944 --> 16:08.244
The reason why
is irrelevant, Your Honor.

16:08.246 --> 16:10.279
I move to have
the confession thrown out.

16:10.281 --> 16:12.015
Your Honor, spontan...

16:12.017 --> 16:13.649
Ms. Reagan, while I sympathize
with your efforts,

16:13.651 --> 16:14.950
I must side with the defense.

16:14.952 --> 16:19.054
The ends can't
justify the means.

16:19.056 --> 16:21.423
The confession
will not be allowed.

16:21.425 --> 16:22.758
Now, I suggest both sides

16:22.760 --> 16:24.994
attempt to reach
a plea agreement.

16:24.996 --> 16:27.129
We'll reconvene
at 1:00.

16:35.739 --> 16:37.072
You're late.

16:37.074 --> 16:39.307
Actually, I was in on time,

16:39.309 --> 16:41.309
but I wanted to get a jump
on the patrol checklist.

16:41.311 --> 16:44.012
So the oil and water

16:44.014 --> 16:46.515
and windshield wipers and tires

16:46.517 --> 16:49.551
and sirens and lights
have all been checked

16:49.553 --> 16:51.719
and are working
at optimal capacity.

16:51.721 --> 16:53.888
Great.

16:55.425 --> 16:57.258
My brother's
a heroin addict.

16:57.260 --> 17:00.995
He's been arrested numerous
times for drug possession,

17:00.997 --> 17:03.264
possession with intent to sell,
assault and burglary

17:03.266 --> 17:05.098
so that he could steal
even more money

17:05.101 --> 17:07.602
so he could buy even more drugs.

17:07.604 --> 17:09.736
I'm sorry.

17:09.738 --> 17:13.507
I lied on my application
to the NYPD.

17:13.509 --> 17:16.410
I didn't write down
that my brother was a junkie

17:16.412 --> 17:19.746
or that my mom has been
arrested too many times to count

17:19.748 --> 17:21.915
for driving while intoxicated.

17:21.916 --> 17:24.185
I didn't put it down
because...

17:26.221 --> 17:30.323
I didn't put it down because all
I ever wanted to be was a cop.

17:30.325 --> 17:32.826
But when I was halfway through
the academy, they found out

17:32.828 --> 17:35.462
that I had omitted
my family's arrest history.

17:35.464 --> 17:37.530
And IAB was called.

17:37.532 --> 17:41.968
Internal Affairs said that
they would overlook my error

17:41.970 --> 17:45.771
if I worked as a field associate
with them for six months.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.576
Why are you telling me this?

17:49.578 --> 17:53.613
Just wanted you to know
why I cooperated with IAB.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.327
I'm Jack Boyle.

18:08.329 --> 18:10.696
Yeah. I know who you are.

18:10.698 --> 18:11.931
Please,

18:11.933 --> 18:12.999
sit.

18:20.774 --> 18:22.508
Can I just say,

18:22.510 --> 18:24.176
I had Professor Black
for Criminal Law.

18:24.178 --> 18:26.778
He'd always tell us
how you rose through the ranks

18:26.780 --> 18:29.214
of the D.A.'s office
to become a bureau chief.

18:29.216 --> 18:30.782
You're, like, a legend.

18:30.784 --> 18:32.250
Well,

18:32.252 --> 18:34.452
please say hi to him
next time you go back.

18:34.454 --> 18:35.453
Oh, he's dead.

18:35.455 --> 18:36.521
I mean,

18:36.523 --> 18:38.890
well, he was ancient
when I had him.

18:41.862 --> 18:43.494
Well, let's just get
right down to it.

18:43.496 --> 18:45.764
Offering Man 1.
15 years.

18:45.766 --> 18:47.098
You don't have
a confession.

18:47.100 --> 18:48.366
Criminally
negligent homicide.

18:48.368 --> 18:49.833
One to three years.

18:49.835 --> 18:52.336
We have a murder weapon that was
found in your client's trash.

18:52.338 --> 18:54.472
Man 2. Five to 15.

18:54.474 --> 18:56.707
We'll pass.

18:58.478 --> 19:01.111
You're not even gonna bring it
to your client?

19:01.113 --> 19:03.514
My client informed me that
he will not take a plea

19:03.516 --> 19:05.315
he's so sure we're gonna win.

19:05.317 --> 19:07.051
Then what are we doing here,
Jack?

19:07.920 --> 19:10.253
Old times' sake?

19:12.692 --> 19:14.992
See you in court.

19:14.994 --> 19:17.795
<i>Dr. Weber and I</i>
<i>were having an affair.</i>

19:17.797 --> 19:19.763
My husband threatened

19:19.765 --> 19:23.132
Dr. Weber, told him
he was going to kill him.

19:23.134 --> 19:25.535
And how did Dr. Weber respond?

19:25.537 --> 19:26.803
Dr. Weber said,

19:26.805 --> 19:29.673
“Not if I kill you first.”

19:30.775 --> 19:33.243
Thank you.

19:33.245 --> 19:35.245
No more questions.

19:35.247 --> 19:38.581
Did you have other affairs,
besides the one with Dr. Weber?

19:38.583 --> 19:40.216
Objection. Relevance.

19:40.218 --> 19:43.652
Ms. Boyle-- I mean Ms. Reagan
brought up the affair as motive.

19:43.654 --> 19:45.554
I have an alternative one.

19:45.556 --> 19:46.789
I'll allow.

19:46.791 --> 19:48.891
You may answer the question.

19:48.893 --> 19:51.728
I had two previous affairs.

19:51.730 --> 19:53.462
Because my husband
and I

19:53.464 --> 19:55.264
had an open marriage.

19:56.734 --> 19:57.733
Meaning?

19:57.735 --> 19:59.201
We both believe that monogamy

19:59.203 --> 20:01.036
is an unnatural expectation.

20:01.038 --> 20:02.738
Relevance, Your Honor.
I understand...

20:02.740 --> 20:05.741
Are you going somewhere
with this, Mr. Boyle?

20:05.743 --> 20:07.042
Indeed I am, Your Honor.

20:07.044 --> 20:09.578
Was your husband
also having an affair?

20:09.580 --> 20:11.113
Yes, he was.

20:11.115 --> 20:12.114
So...

20:12.116 --> 20:13.915
his lover could've killed him.

20:13.917 --> 20:15.817
Objection.
Speculation.

20:15.819 --> 20:18.954
The jury will disregard
the last remark from Mr. Boyle.

20:18.956 --> 20:21.957
No more questions.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.591
Ms. Manis, I have a question.

20:23.593 --> 20:24.926
Why do you think

20:24.928 --> 20:27.328
your husband threatened
to kill Dr. Weber

20:27.330 --> 20:29.664
when he found out
about your affair?

20:29.666 --> 20:35.370
Because love
can be unpredictable.

20:41.944 --> 20:44.478
You know, always amazes me

20:44.480 --> 20:46.947
how small the human
heart actually is.

20:46.949 --> 20:49.917
Eight to ten ounces for a woman,
ten to 12 for a guy.

20:49.919 --> 20:51.685
Hmm.
Men have bigger hearts?

20:51.687 --> 20:54.221
That's debatable.
But, technically, yes.

20:54.223 --> 20:56.056
You know,
those extra few ounces we have

20:56.058 --> 20:58.458
is what always gets us
in trouble with you guys.

20:59.330 --> 21:01.228
What can you tell us
about Emily Copeland?

21:01.229 --> 21:04.130
Her cause of death
was suffocation. My guess,

21:04.132 --> 21:06.366
a pillow was placed
over her face and held there

21:06.368 --> 21:07.501
for about three minutes.

21:07.503 --> 21:09.536
You find anything
under her fingernails?

21:09.538 --> 21:11.405
I wish.
No DNA for you.

21:11.407 --> 21:13.139
No hair or skin,
other than the victim's.

21:13.141 --> 21:14.441
No defense wounds?

21:14.443 --> 21:16.409
Isn't that unusual,
you know, in a suffocation--

21:16.411 --> 21:17.743
no defense wounds?

21:17.745 --> 21:20.046
What's more unusual
isn't that she was suffocated

21:20.048 --> 21:21.514
but that she would've
been dead anyway.

21:21.516 --> 21:23.049
My guess:
within a month.

21:23.051 --> 21:24.350
Why?

21:24.352 --> 21:27.220
She had late-stage
pancreatic cancer.

21:41.336 --> 21:43.136
I know my rights.

21:43.138 --> 21:45.338
I want to know
what this is about.

21:45.340 --> 21:47.373
The judge said
I was free to go.

21:47.375 --> 21:49.509
I told you my case
was dismissed.

21:49.511 --> 21:51.577
So why am I being...
Please, just step this way.

21:51.579 --> 21:54.813
Not until I find out
why I'm here.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.087
Please sit down.

22:02.089 --> 22:04.523
I don't understand.
My charges were dismissed.

22:04.525 --> 22:05.891
I'm aware.

22:05.893 --> 22:08.594
You got the charges dropped.
Yes.

22:08.596 --> 22:10.395
But that doesn't
buy me shutting up.

22:10.397 --> 22:13.465
Wasn't meant to. Please?

22:20.174 --> 22:22.807
I looked into your son's murder.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.742
He was killed in a turf war

22:24.744 --> 22:27.712
between the Double Treys
and the Warrior Kings.

22:27.714 --> 22:28.813
Well, who did it?

22:28.815 --> 22:30.582
A 15-year-old member

22:30.584 --> 22:33.217
of the Double Treys.

22:33.219 --> 22:36.054
Why? Why Charles?

22:38.592 --> 22:40.892
Did he know my boy?

22:45.632 --> 22:47.832
I don't have that information.

22:49.268 --> 22:51.034
Does it matter?

22:51.036 --> 22:53.104
In that he took a life
that he didn't mean to,

22:53.106 --> 22:55.272
so there's another piece
of misery out there?

22:55.274 --> 22:57.975
You can look at it that way;
I can't.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.244
I can try.
They may be numbers to you,

23:00.246 --> 23:01.678
but they're all people to me.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.447
Nobody's just a number.

23:03.449 --> 23:05.515
A black teenager
in East New York?

23:05.517 --> 23:07.283
I know his name, who he was,

23:07.285 --> 23:09.786
who his mother is,
so please stop it.

23:09.788 --> 23:12.355
You have no idea what it's like

23:12.357 --> 23:14.524
to lose a child.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.696
You throw your weight around

23:19.698 --> 23:21.864
and you get someone
to name who killed my boy

23:21.866 --> 23:23.833
and now you get to go back
to your office

23:23.835 --> 23:25.201
and feel good about yourself?

23:25.203 --> 23:28.004
Nothing about this
makes me feel good.

23:28.006 --> 23:31.508
When Charles was killed
I started a group.

23:31.510 --> 23:32.742
I'm aware.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.944
We have 55 members so far.

23:34.946 --> 23:38.681
All mothers who have lost
their children to violence.

23:38.683 --> 23:42.618
We have vigils and marches
and rallies,

23:42.620 --> 23:45.454
and guess who's never there
at any of these events.

23:45.456 --> 23:47.957
Your cops.

24:14.685 --> 24:15.917
So, who died?

24:15.919 --> 24:18.953
33-year-old woman
with a four-year-old kid.

24:18.955 --> 24:21.289
40-year-old dermatologist
from the Upper West Side.

24:21.291 --> 24:23.958
And a 16-year-old
in East New York.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.426
I didn't mean it literally.

24:25.428 --> 24:27.495
You just forgot
who was at the table.

24:27.497 --> 24:29.497
Okay. Sorry.

24:29.499 --> 24:30.698
A great partnership.

24:30.700 --> 24:31.932
You and Eddie?
Yeah, Sarge

24:31.934 --> 24:33.067
switched us up.
Now he's got me

24:33.069 --> 24:34.535
riding with an IAB snitch.

24:34.537 --> 24:37.905
Oh, that's a real waste of IA
manpower, don't you think?

24:37.907 --> 24:39.173
What's that supposed to mean?

24:39.175 --> 24:40.641
Well, their snitch
is riding around with,

24:40.643 --> 24:41.942
you know, Dudley Do-Right.

24:43.313 --> 24:44.611
How is it you can make
even my being a good cop

24:44.613 --> 24:45.813
into a bad thing?
I didn't say

24:45.815 --> 24:48.182
it was a bad thing.
Well, you'll be happy

24:48.184 --> 24:49.482
to know that they switched us up

24:49.484 --> 24:50.818
for punking
another pair of partners.

24:50.820 --> 24:52.385
<i>I'll</i> be happy to know?

24:52.387 --> 24:53.954
Well, no, not you.

24:53.956 --> 24:55.956
Just forgot
who was at the table.

24:57.159 --> 24:58.291
16-year-old, how?

24:58.293 --> 24:59.526
Gunshot. Question's why.

24:59.528 --> 25:00.527
All right, why?

25:00.529 --> 25:03.763
Kid's poor, bored, and armed.

25:03.765 --> 25:04.964
And in East New York.

25:04.966 --> 25:06.366
Still a war zone, huh?

25:06.368 --> 25:08.335
Well, it's much
better than it was

25:08.337 --> 25:09.769
when I was there ten years ago.

25:09.771 --> 25:11.170
But it's still East New York.

25:11.172 --> 25:12.305
Define “better.”

25:12.307 --> 25:13.540
Well, less terrible.

25:13.542 --> 25:16.343
That's a pretty low bar.
Not compared

25:16.345 --> 25:17.944
to 40 years ago.

25:17.946 --> 25:20.113
If you lost someone,
“better” isn't good enough.

25:20.115 --> 25:21.347
So what do you tell them?

25:21.349 --> 25:24.016
That is a good question
with no good answer.

25:24.018 --> 25:26.719
Sometimes it's best
not to tell 'em anything

25:26.721 --> 25:29.122
and just listen instead.

25:29.124 --> 25:30.689
Can't you just
send more cops there?

25:30.691 --> 25:32.258
Wish it were that simple.

25:32.260 --> 25:34.025
People move to change
the subject.

25:34.027 --> 25:36.094
Seconded.
Thirded.

25:36.096 --> 25:37.663
You guys have something
more fun to talk about

25:37.665 --> 25:39.698
than life or death?

25:39.700 --> 25:41.367
What'd you expect,
given who's at the table?

25:41.369 --> 25:44.870
Okay, so... go.

25:44.872 --> 25:47.172
Mom's case?
Dad's across the aisle

25:47.174 --> 25:48.907
on the defense.

25:48.909 --> 25:50.608
I was not thinking that.

25:50.610 --> 25:52.543
Slick Jack? Really?

25:52.545 --> 25:55.180
Wow. How's that going for you?

25:55.182 --> 25:57.259
He's dating his co-counsel.
She's 25.

25:57.283 --> 25:57.817
Ugh.

25:59.352 --> 26:00.852
Nicky, zip it.

26:00.854 --> 26:03.354
Is she hot?
What?

26:04.724 --> 26:06.357
Okay, how about we

26:06.359 --> 26:07.625
go back to East New York?

26:07.627 --> 26:09.356
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
what is she like?

26:09.475 --> 26:10.362
No way.

26:10.363 --> 26:12.664
25, really?

26:12.666 --> 26:14.198
Thanks, Nicky.

26:32.418 --> 26:33.984
So, is she?

26:33.986 --> 26:36.420
Is she what?

26:36.422 --> 26:38.422
Hot.

26:40.091 --> 26:41.958
In a cheap sort of way,
I suppose.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.960
And charmed by Jack, I'm sure.

26:43.962 --> 26:46.330
Jack can still talk
the green off a leaf,

26:46.332 --> 26:47.731
I'll give him that.

26:47.733 --> 26:49.899
Well, Jack's always gonna be
one of those guys

26:49.901 --> 26:51.435
who thinks
the grass is greener.

26:51.437 --> 26:54.304
Well, now the grass
is 20 years younger.

26:54.306 --> 26:55.706
Ouch.

26:55.708 --> 26:56.906
Mm.

26:56.908 --> 26:59.943
Do you remember
Aunt Agnes and Aunt Ruth?

26:59.945 --> 27:01.845
Yeah, you used to
drag us to Bushwick

27:01.847 --> 27:03.112
to see them every month.

27:03.114 --> 27:04.747
Yeah. And neither one of them

27:04.749 --> 27:07.250
ever got married, even once.

27:07.252 --> 27:08.918
So I got them beat?

27:08.920 --> 27:10.653
No.
Are you calling me

27:10.655 --> 27:11.988
a spinster aunt?

27:11.990 --> 27:14.657
Every family like ours has one.

27:14.659 --> 27:16.058
Well, my money's on Jamie.

27:16.060 --> 27:17.893
No such thing
as a spinster uncle.

27:17.895 --> 27:19.662
That's a double standard, Dad.

27:22.166 --> 27:23.966
Erin...

27:23.968 --> 27:26.502
you need to move on.
Yeah, well,

27:26.504 --> 27:27.908
I can't right now. I have to deal with him.

27:27.909 --> 27:30.439
Not the kind
of moving on I'm talking about.

27:30.440 --> 27:34.309
I know. But this comes first
and foremost.

27:34.311 --> 27:36.078
You turned down a plea.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.779
He wanted three years.
It was a fire sale.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.548
As opposed to zero
if you lose.

27:40.550 --> 27:43.318
I'd bet on me, Dad.

27:43.320 --> 27:45.487
Ask you this.

27:45.489 --> 27:48.189
If Jack wasn't on the case,

27:48.191 --> 27:51.359
would you have taken the plea?

27:53.096 --> 27:54.962
I guess we'll never know.

28:01.037 --> 28:02.736
<i>So it looks like Brian took out</i>

28:02.738 --> 28:05.206
the insurance policy
after his wife was diagnosed

28:05.208 --> 28:07.375
with the cancer.
Okay, but the thing is, though,

28:07.377 --> 28:09.911
if he took out the policy,
why would he risk killing her

28:09.913 --> 28:12.079
when she would've died naturally
in a few weeks anyway?

28:12.081 --> 28:13.847
Maybe he was anxious
to get started.

28:13.849 --> 28:15.883
Well, I'm banking
on that 12-ounce heart

28:15.885 --> 28:17.651
factoring into this equation
at some point.

28:17.653 --> 28:19.753
Since when? You're
usually the cynical one.

28:19.755 --> 28:21.622
Well, we're just
missing something.

28:21.624 --> 28:23.824
Yeah, a confession.

28:26.762 --> 28:28.929
I think I know how to get one.

28:29.932 --> 28:32.433
You want me
to question Manis' mistress,

28:32.435 --> 28:34.100
see if she and her husband
have alibis?

28:34.102 --> 28:35.568
It wouldn't hurt.

28:35.570 --> 28:37.537
I mean,
we know who killed Manis.

28:37.539 --> 28:38.871
At least we have the knife.

28:38.873 --> 28:41.408
What is taking so long?

28:41.410 --> 28:43.476
Hey, we got court, pal.

28:43.478 --> 28:45.045
You want to step it up, here?

28:45.047 --> 28:48.848
So, uh, how come
you and Jack broke up?

28:48.850 --> 28:51.918
Irreconcilable differences.

28:51.920 --> 28:54.654
I got irreconcilable differences
with every woman I ever date.

28:54.656 --> 28:56.856
Isn't that what
keeps it interesting?

28:59.159 --> 29:00.459
Got the evidence?

29:00.461 --> 29:02.160
It's not here.
What do you mean it's not here?

29:02.162 --> 29:02.728
It's gone.

29:02.752 --> 29:04.464
How can it be gone?
It's the evidence

29:04.465 --> 29:05.764
in a murder investigation.

29:05.766 --> 29:08.199
It's not where
it's supposed to be.

29:08.201 --> 29:09.901
Then check where
it's not supposed to be.

29:09.903 --> 29:11.937
I did.
It's not there either.

29:11.939 --> 29:13.972
How can the evidence
go missing?

29:13.974 --> 29:15.406
Well, maybe you removed it
for a hearing.

29:15.408 --> 29:17.175
We did not remove it.

29:17.177 --> 29:18.376
What do you want me to tell you?

29:18.378 --> 29:19.743
You're lucky this cage

29:19.745 --> 29:21.346
is separating us, that's what.

29:25.151 --> 29:27.218
<i>From what I understand,</i>

29:27.220 --> 29:29.420
pancreatic cancer--
it's the least detectable

29:29.422 --> 29:32.723
until it's too late, so you must
have felt completely helpless

29:32.725 --> 29:34.625
when your wife
got her diagnosis.

29:34.627 --> 29:37.862
And then, I would assume,
after you got the diagnosis,

29:37.864 --> 29:40.297
that's when you went out and got
the life insurance policy.

29:40.299 --> 29:42.566
It's not unusual to have
a life insurance policy.

29:42.568 --> 29:43.701
Absolutely not.

29:43.703 --> 29:45.603
I mean, it's a little unusual

29:45.605 --> 29:48.138
when you get one six months
before your 33-year-old wife

29:48.140 --> 29:51.674
is murdered
under suspicious circumstances.

29:51.676 --> 29:52.876
But that's
neither here not there.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.677
Why don't you just say
what you want to say?

29:54.679 --> 29:57.214
Brian, I...
I'm not saying anything.

29:57.216 --> 29:59.616
And I certainly don't think
you're a murderer.

29:59.618 --> 30:01.584
Now, your mother-in-law may,

30:01.586 --> 30:03.286
and you did buy that
life insurance policy,

30:03.288 --> 30:04.487
but I don't.

30:04.489 --> 30:06.322
I think I might need a lawyer.

30:06.324 --> 30:09.091
Just told you
I believe you, Brian.

30:09.093 --> 30:12.028
I don't think you did it.

30:12.030 --> 30:14.296
One second.

30:18.403 --> 30:19.936
Really?

30:24.042 --> 30:27.043
I told you.
I knew you were a good guy.

30:27.045 --> 30:28.777
You're not gonna need
a lawyer after all.

30:28.779 --> 30:30.546
How's that?

30:30.548 --> 30:31.713
We got the guy.

30:31.715 --> 30:33.049
What are you talking about?

30:33.051 --> 30:34.316
We got the guy

30:34.318 --> 30:35.884
who killed Emily.
He's sitting

30:35.886 --> 30:37.553
right there,
next to my desk.

30:37.555 --> 30:39.254
This guy's a career
criminal. He's already hit

30:39.256 --> 30:41.222
six buildings in
the area. We got him

30:41.224 --> 30:43.659
on video going into
your building around the time

30:43.661 --> 30:45.894
of Emily's murder.
He's got no alibi.

30:45.896 --> 30:47.663
That can't be.
It can be.

30:47.665 --> 30:49.297
The D.A.'s charging him
with manslaughter

30:49.299 --> 30:51.266
in the first degree.
That son of a bitch

30:51.268 --> 30:53.134
is looking at 25 to life, easy.

30:53.136 --> 30:55.770
No, you can't charge him.
Gonna charge him?

30:55.772 --> 30:56.971
We already are.

30:56.973 --> 30:58.973
And guess what, Brian.

30:58.975 --> 31:01.809
You've been through enough,
you are free to go.

31:01.811 --> 31:02.910
No!

31:05.615 --> 31:06.914
What?

31:06.916 --> 31:09.750
He didn't do it.

31:10.753 --> 31:12.887
Sit down.

31:22.037 --> 31:24.837
Your Honor, the People would
like to request a continuance.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.272
On what grounds?

31:26.274 --> 31:27.840
Your Honor, through
no fault of our own,

31:27.842 --> 31:29.976
the evidence in this case

31:29.978 --> 31:32.545
is missing from
the property clerk's office.

31:32.547 --> 31:35.414
How does evidence go missing,
Ms. Reagan?

31:35.416 --> 31:37.483
We are looking into that,
Your Honor.

31:37.485 --> 31:39.218
We'd like to move for
this case to be dismissed.

31:39.220 --> 31:40.319
Your Honor,

31:40.321 --> 31:42.688
the People request
a 24-hour continuance.

31:42.690 --> 31:45.090
Do the People have anything else
that links

31:45.092 --> 31:46.758
the defendant to the
crime? Fingerprints?

31:46.760 --> 31:48.293
An eyewitness?

31:48.295 --> 31:49.360
No, but

31:49.362 --> 31:50.696
the weapon...
Ms. Reagan, we have

31:50.698 --> 31:52.263
a jury
that we've been inconveniencing

31:52.265 --> 31:53.732
for two days.

31:54.768 --> 31:56.668
I'm dismissing the case.

31:57.470 --> 31:58.469
With prejudice, Your Honor?

31:58.471 --> 31:59.337
Your Honor...

31:59.339 --> 32:03.308
Dismissed... <i>with</i> prejudice.

32:15.154 --> 32:16.854
You almost done
with that 61?

32:16.856 --> 32:19.890
Just dotting the Is
and crossing the Ts.

32:19.892 --> 32:22.392
Reagan...

32:22.394 --> 32:25.162
that info
DeMarcus gave you panned out.

32:25.164 --> 32:27.698
Narcotics is executing
that warrant tonight,

32:27.700 --> 32:29.299
if you want to join.

32:29.301 --> 32:32.502
I'm only interested
if my partner can come.

32:37.876 --> 32:40.477
She's in bed with IAB,

32:40.479 --> 32:42.379
you know.

32:42.381 --> 32:45.081
We arrested
DeMarcus together.

32:49.555 --> 32:52.522
Suit yourself.

32:52.524 --> 32:57.660
Then, um, both of you
ready to roll, 1900 hours.

33:00.531 --> 33:01.731
What?

33:01.733 --> 33:03.199
I thought you didn't like me.
It's not

33:03.201 --> 33:04.533
that I didn't like you.

33:04.535 --> 33:06.302
It's that I didn't trust you.

33:06.304 --> 33:08.337
But now you do... trust me?

33:09.574 --> 33:13.376
Nah. It's just, you're so good
at checking the oil in the car.

33:30.360 --> 33:32.560
How you doing, Mr. Copeland?

33:32.562 --> 33:34.562
My lawyer advised me...

33:34.564 --> 33:35.964
Not to speak to anyone.

33:35.966 --> 33:37.833
He's right.

33:37.835 --> 33:40.068
So, I'll talk,
and you listen, okay?

33:40.070 --> 33:43.205
Toxicology report
came back yesterday.

33:43.207 --> 33:46.775
They found secobarbital
in your wife's system.

33:46.777 --> 33:48.976
The M.E. said that secobarbital

33:48.978 --> 33:53.748
is used to treat insomnia,
or as a sedative before surgery.

33:53.750 --> 33:55.283
So?

33:55.285 --> 33:56.518
So,

33:56.520 --> 33:58.586
I found the bottle

33:58.588 --> 34:01.222
of secobarbital
in your medicine cabinet.

34:01.224 --> 34:03.858
Interesting.
You know, it's...

34:03.860 --> 34:07.195
prescribed
by a doctor in Vermont.

34:07.197 --> 34:10.097
I thought to myself,
why would a couple from New York

34:10.099 --> 34:12.099
go all the way to Vermont

34:12.101 --> 34:14.768
to get a prescription?

34:14.770 --> 34:19.940
Couldn't figure it out,
so I called the doctor myself.

34:19.942 --> 34:24.277
He told me
that secobarbital is also used

34:24.279 --> 34:26.913
in physician-assisted suicide,

34:26.915 --> 34:29.983
which is legal in Vermont,
but, unfortunately,

34:29.985 --> 34:32.918
it's not legal in New York.

34:34.121 --> 34:36.223
I can't do this.

34:36.225 --> 34:40.458
He also told me you called him
the day your wife was murdered.

34:40.460 --> 34:42.360
She wanted to die
on her own terms.

34:42.362 --> 34:43.963
She didn't want to drag it out.

34:43.965 --> 34:45.630
And the doc agreed.

34:45.632 --> 34:46.899
But when

34:46.900 --> 34:48.433
she took it, it didn't work.

34:48.435 --> 34:50.502
I called the doctor, panicked.

34:52.039 --> 34:53.605
He apologized,

34:53.607 --> 34:55.841
said that it's
an inexact science,

34:55.842 --> 34:57.476
that he didn't prescribe

34:57.478 --> 35:00.178
the right amount.

35:00.180 --> 35:03.615
And then Emily turned to me,

35:03.617 --> 35:06.184
and she knew
the drug would knock her out.

35:06.186 --> 35:09.855
But... it wouldn't be enough
to kill her.

35:14.327 --> 35:17.161
So she asked you to smother her

35:17.163 --> 35:20.131
while she was unconscious,
right?

35:20.133 --> 35:22.566
I didn't want to.
I really didn't want to,

35:22.568 --> 35:25.803
but I didn't want to see her
in any more pain.

35:27.774 --> 35:30.340
I did what she asked.

35:32.211 --> 35:34.845
I loved her.

35:38.217 --> 35:41.519
She let go so peacefully,

35:41.521 --> 35:44.154
just the way she wanted.

35:44.156 --> 35:46.323
And I don't care
what happens to me.

35:46.325 --> 35:49.026
I have no regrets.

35:49.895 --> 35:52.529
Nor should you.

36:17.121 --> 36:19.755
Hi.

36:19.757 --> 36:22.358
Congratulations.

36:22.360 --> 36:23.926
I'm sorry.
For what?

36:23.928 --> 36:25.527
I'm sorry you
lost your case.

36:25.529 --> 36:27.563
I'm sorry I accused you
of being judgmental.

36:27.565 --> 36:30.333
You're right.
I'm... I am judgmental.

36:30.335 --> 36:33.535
And I'm sorry you were
forced to deal with Mandy.

36:33.537 --> 36:35.070
Mandy. Are you kidding?

36:35.072 --> 36:36.638
Her name rhymes with...
Candy.

36:36.640 --> 36:39.842
I know. I'm sorry
about that, too.

36:39.844 --> 36:41.142
Where is she, anyway?

36:41.144 --> 36:43.411
Uh, speaking at a
Women in Law symposium

36:43.413 --> 36:44.813
geared to first-years.

36:44.815 --> 36:46.815
Beautiful and smart.

36:46.817 --> 36:48.951
Are you done apologizing?

36:48.953 --> 36:52.854
I think so, unless there's
something I'm not thinking of.

36:52.856 --> 36:54.655
Anyway, Mandy
and I are, uh...

36:54.657 --> 36:56.891
We're not going
out anymore.

36:56.893 --> 36:58.093
What happened?

36:58.095 --> 36:59.394
We went out to eat,

36:59.396 --> 37:01.396
and the waiter thought
she was my daughter.

37:01.398 --> 37:04.966
That... that, and she
ordered Bay Breezes.

37:04.968 --> 37:07.402
We used to drink Bay Breezes.

37:07.404 --> 37:09.436
We were 19.

37:09.438 --> 37:11.806
Wow. I've known you that long?

37:11.808 --> 37:14.008
Unfortunately, yes.

37:14.844 --> 37:17.444
Want to go out and
get a bite to eat?

37:17.446 --> 37:20.147
No.

37:20.149 --> 37:21.549
I mean, no, thank you.

37:21.551 --> 37:23.551
I'm meeting Danny at O'Malleys.

37:23.553 --> 37:24.985
I'd invite you, but...

37:24.987 --> 37:27.321
He'd rather use my
face as a dartboard.

37:27.323 --> 37:29.956
Something like that.

37:29.958 --> 37:33.660
I don't get this
with anyone else.

37:33.662 --> 37:37.231
What, the verbal abuse?
This.

37:37.233 --> 37:39.333
You.

37:39.335 --> 37:43.136
You're funny and smart.

37:43.138 --> 37:48.775
Not smart enough to put
a vicious killer behind bars.

37:48.777 --> 37:53.179
You ever consider you might
be wrong about Weber?

37:53.181 --> 37:55.381
And me?

37:56.952 --> 37:59.118
No.

38:02.090 --> 38:04.957
Good night, Jack.

38:16.837 --> 38:18.470
Thank you.

38:18.472 --> 38:20.238
You're welcome.

38:20.240 --> 38:22.274
Hey, right on time.

38:22.276 --> 38:24.977
Ordered beers, and the
wings coming right up.

38:24.979 --> 38:27.580
Good, because I am
drinking to forget tonight.

38:27.582 --> 38:28.981
You lost?

38:28.983 --> 38:31.283
Yup. Murderer got off
Scot-free,

38:31.285 --> 38:33.118
and the judge dismissed it
with prejudice,

38:33.120 --> 38:34.652
so I can't retry.

38:34.654 --> 38:36.621
Great Jack Boyle strikes again.

38:36.623 --> 38:40.158
My witness testified that
she was in an open marriage

38:40.160 --> 38:43.095
because monogamy is unnatural.

38:43.097 --> 38:46.398
What's unnatural are yo-yos
like Jack running around

38:46.400 --> 38:49.200
in a perpetual state
of adolescence.

38:49.202 --> 38:51.135
You and Dad hated Jack
the moment you met him.

38:51.137 --> 38:52.737
I don't know why
I never saw that.

38:52.739 --> 38:55.306
Love, like justice, is blind.

38:55.308 --> 38:57.075
And marriage is an eye-opener?

38:57.077 --> 38:58.910
Don't go there, please.

38:58.912 --> 39:00.979
I don't know what's worse--
your situation or mine.

39:00.981 --> 39:03.780
My guy's looking at 15 years
for mercy-killing his wife

39:03.782 --> 39:05.782
who was gonna die
in a month anyway.

39:05.784 --> 39:09.620
Part of me wishes I'd never
figured out it was him.

39:09.622 --> 39:11.088
Well, I spoke to the D.A.

39:11.090 --> 39:13.424
They're gonna plead down to
criminally negligent homicide.

39:13.426 --> 39:14.691
He won't do the max.

39:14.693 --> 39:16.760
Well, that's something.
Thank you.

39:16.762 --> 39:20.063
Ms. Reagan?

39:20.065 --> 39:21.832
I didn't mean
to startle you.

39:21.834 --> 39:23.399
I just saw you head
this way after court.

39:23.401 --> 39:25.435
Who is he? Who are you?
Uh...

39:25.437 --> 39:29.740
I just wanted you to know
that you were right.

39:30.976 --> 39:33.543
He was very weak.
I barely broke a sweat.

39:33.545 --> 39:35.311
Enjoy your drinks.

39:36.481 --> 39:39.315
He's the guy? Hey!

39:39.317 --> 39:40.650
Danny.
Hey!

39:40.652 --> 39:42.152
Danny.

40:10.947 --> 40:13.815
Other people get to say
about their kids,

40:13.817 --> 40:16.151
“Oh, they grow up so fast.”

40:16.153 --> 40:18.220
We don't.

40:18.222 --> 40:21.923
But today I'm gonna,
because I want to.

40:21.925 --> 40:26.527
Charles-- he did,
he grew up so fast.

40:26.529 --> 40:28.797
He was but nine
when he announced

40:28.799 --> 40:31.132
he didn't believe
in Santa Claus anymore.

40:31.134 --> 40:33.634
Now, we spent Christmas
out at my dad's

40:33.636 --> 40:35.103
in the Pennsylvania woods.

40:35.105 --> 40:37.739
We had a tree and a fireplace,

40:37.741 --> 40:42.710
so a chimney
for Santa to come out of.

40:42.712 --> 40:45.479
So that Christmas Eve,

40:45.481 --> 40:49.750
I got a pair of my dad's boots--
big feet, my dad--

40:49.752 --> 40:51.219
and I dipped them in the ashes

40:51.221 --> 40:54.788
in the fireplace and made tracks
going to the tree

40:54.790 --> 40:58.559
with the presents
and back to the fireplace,

40:58.561 --> 41:02.562
like Santa tracked ash
all over the floor.

41:22.384 --> 41:24.618
Welcome.

41:27.856 --> 41:30.056
Thank you.

41:50.711 --> 41:53.879
Anyway, Charles--

41:53.881 --> 41:57.683
he bought it lock,
stock and barrel,

41:57.685 --> 42:00.786
and we got a good two more years

42:00.788 --> 42:04.690
of believing
in Santa after that.

42:05.519 --> 42:10.054
And that's what
I'm thinking about tonight.
