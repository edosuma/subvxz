04:47.287 --> 04:50.833
You smelly imperialist!
Go back to where you came from.

05:03.762 --> 05:09.935
Modesty is beauty and heavenly.

05:58.609 --> 06:01.236
- Search their bags.
- What the hell is wrong?

06:19.588 --> 06:23.801
- Take them for a body search.
- Leila! Why are you squirming so much?

06:24.468 --> 06:26.095
You all right, little girl?

06:26.095 --> 06:28.847
I have a really bad rash.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.059
What?

06:35.229 --> 06:36.396
You're free to go.

06:40.359 --> 06:41.568
What did you bring us?

06:43.362 --> 06:45.239
Victory!

10:19.411 --> 10:23.248
Shireen, darling.
Make peace with your daughter.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.418
Okay.

10:38.055 --> 10:40.932
The hospital called three times.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.809
- Wake up! It's our turn.
- What's happened?

10:42.809 --> 10:44.603
You're getting a new heart.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.775
What if we don't make it?

10:50.609 --> 10:52.361
Maybe it's not my destiny.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.782
Crazy traffic!

11:36.988 --> 11:39.658
<i>Hey, moron, it's a car,
not a donkey. Move it!</i>

11:46.373 --> 11:49.000
Why is it so busy? Come on, go!

11:51.086 --> 11:52.170
It's getting late.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.468
Yah Imam Zaman! We need your help.

12:02.931 --> 12:03.765
He came!

13:13.210 --> 13:14.628
I told you he'd come.

13:41.279 --> 13:42.822
Does she think we are cannibals?

14:03.593 --> 14:05.095
Is she saying I'm a dog?

14:24.781 --> 14:25.949
Find Vahid.

14:31.871 --> 14:35.375
And when I wake up,
I want to see all my children.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.336
Both Vahid and Leila.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.764
Oh, I love Persian soap operas.

14:50.765 --> 14:51.975
Where's the popcorn?

14:58.690 --> 15:01.943
Are you okay? They told me you were sick.

15:03.445 --> 15:05.196
I feel good when you're here.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.033
You're the only one who likes me.

15:09.909 --> 15:14.372
- Shall I take you to the hospital?
- Your mother doesn't want me there.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.916
It's me she doesn't want there.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.419
My mom is heartless.

15:20.128 --> 15:24.549
You two can't fight forever.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.384
You're a writer.

15:27.594 --> 15:31.181
If you want to understand your mother,
write about her.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.225
I'm tired.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.332
How's life?

19:13.278 --> 19:14.529
How is Duncan?

19:19.492 --> 19:22.996
We're not together anymore.
We broke up like nine years ago.

19:23.538 --> 19:26.833
You did good.
You don't love him, leave him.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.960
Mom wanted me to marry him.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.379
Forget it. Have fun with someone new.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.257
Just don't get carried away.

19:34.757 --> 19:40.013
But if you must, put it
in the back door, so you stay a virgin.

19:41.389 --> 19:44.684
I let Grandpa do that
before we got married.

19:47.228 --> 19:52.358
You think we just stared
across the room at each other?

19:52.358 --> 19:53.985
Can we change the subject?

19:55.278 --> 19:57.697
Spoiled! You're just like your mother.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.450
You overreact just like her.

20:01.659 --> 20:03.453
I'm nothing like my mother.

20:10.960 --> 20:14.130
Do you know
why your parents came to America?

20:15.757 --> 20:18.718
Sure. It was 1967...

20:57.382 --> 21:00.176
<i>No, Leila. That's only one version.</i>

21:03.471 --> 21:06.099
<i>Your parents were escaping.</i>

21:06.099 --> 21:08.309
<i>Escaping a scandal.</i>

21:08.309 --> 21:10.144
<i>A scandal!</i>

21:12.689 --> 21:15.525
Mom never mentioned a scandal.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.902
They're here!

23:11.432 --> 23:14.352
What a gorgeous dress you made me.

23:15.186 --> 23:19.232
Look. I've gotten so many compliments.

23:19.232 --> 23:22.068
Just take the money.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.698
Don't mention it to your husband.

23:28.366 --> 23:30.993
None of his business how you make money.

23:33.871 --> 23:36.457
Happy Persian New Year!

23:38.251 --> 23:41.337
I brought you a little gift.
I hope you like it.

24:16.789 --> 24:17.999
Why are you spying here?

24:18.583 --> 24:22.044
Instead of helping me, you're doing this?
Go back to the party.

25:00.416 --> 25:01.667
What are you wearing?

25:21.604 --> 25:22.980
Your omelet is ready.

25:25.233 --> 25:26.567
You have to go to school today.

25:46.671 --> 25:47.505
How's that?

28:47.768 --> 28:49.603
The building is worth 200,000.

28:51.313 --> 28:55.651
I bought it for 40,000
and that is what I'll sell it for.

28:56.277 --> 28:58.863
Fine. How do you expect
to pay your hospital bills?

29:00.072 --> 29:01.907
We talked about this, Ali Reza.

29:02.450 --> 29:05.327
The building is worth
five times what you paid.

29:07.496 --> 29:08.497
It is what it is.

29:11.625 --> 29:12.751
We can take a loan.

29:15.880 --> 29:19.133
We won't take any loans.
We won't borrow from anyone.

29:20.134 --> 29:21.635
There is a word for that.

29:23.262 --> 29:24.346
Usury.

29:24.346 --> 29:27.683
This isn't Iran. We live in America now.

29:28.434 --> 29:32.605
Do you think God cares where we live?

29:34.106 --> 29:36.317
There are not two right things to do.

29:37.985 --> 29:40.279
And feeding our nine children?

29:41.322 --> 29:45.284
And paying your medical bills?
What does God have to say about that?

29:47.286 --> 29:48.287
God is generous.

29:59.548 --> 30:00.549
God help me.

31:38.230 --> 31:41.400
You can do anything better
than your brother.

33:28.549 --> 33:30.509
Are you not going to cook dinner?

35:18.033 --> 35:19.952
When is Leila getting married?

35:19.952 --> 35:21.078
Good question.

35:26.250 --> 35:29.962
- So when is Leila getting married?
- A miracle must happen.

40:41.064 --> 40:42.399
Who's this ugly guy?

41:37.829 --> 41:38.830
What did he say?

41:39.456 --> 41:40.999
He says, "I'm pregnant."

41:40.999 --> 41:44.377
My God, men in this country get pregnant?

42:05.649 --> 42:06.566
What did he say?

42:06.566 --> 42:08.401
He said, "I'm a child of England."

42:08.401 --> 42:10.612
Meaning "I'm pregnant."

42:12.364 --> 42:16.493
Didn't I tell you "from the back door"?

42:16.493 --> 42:17.577
The front?!

43:33.236 --> 43:34.070
It's a girl?

47:56.332 --> 47:57.542
Wow, you shaved.

47:59.294 --> 48:00.920
You should've worn more makeup.

48:08.094 --> 48:09.095
Turn it up.

53:52.730 --> 53:54.899
Weren't you supposed
to be taking care of Mamanjoon?

55:36.751 --> 55:39.253
Thanks, love.

55:46.218 --> 55:47.553
You still got it.

55:47.553 --> 55:50.639
If film doesn't work out,
I could open a restaurant.

55:51.474 --> 55:55.311
In the West, you live to work.

55:55.311 --> 55:56.896
You are your work.

55:56.896 --> 55:58.689
What about joy?

55:58.689 --> 56:01.609
You don't have a family to support yet.

56:01.609 --> 56:04.570
So why work, work, work?

56:05.905 --> 56:07.823
I work because I have ambitions.

56:08.324 --> 56:11.911
Remember to live,
amongst all those ambitions.

56:11.911 --> 56:13.454
You'll be a mother soon.

56:14.163 --> 56:15.664
So don't forget yourself.

56:35.184 --> 56:37.061
So about that scandal
you mentioned before...

56:39.980 --> 56:42.066
<i>why did my parents come to America?</i>

56:48.739 --> 56:52.535
Your mom was a lot like you
when she was young.

56:55.079 --> 56:56.872
<i>She was brilliant.</i>

56:56.872 --> 57:00.751
The square root of 4356 is 66.

57:01.794 --> 57:04.630
6TH GRADE MATH CONTEST

57:04.630 --> 57:09.093
<i>Back then,
girls didn't have the same chance as boys.</i>

57:10.302 --> 57:11.846
You're so selfish.

57:12.555 --> 57:15.641
So, what if I'm selfish?
I want to finish seventh grade.

57:15.641 --> 57:17.810
I don't want to get married.

57:19.270 --> 57:21.856
<i>When she married your father,</i>

57:21.856 --> 57:27.528
<i>they moved to a remote village
with no water or electricity.</i>

57:28.320 --> 57:29.905
<i>Opposite of where she grew up.</i>

57:30.614 --> 57:35.161
<i>When your brother Shivaz was born,
I went to the village to help your mom.</i>

57:47.381 --> 57:50.467
Why are you washing all those clothes?

57:50.467 --> 57:52.094
Leave it.

57:52.094 --> 57:53.179
I'm fine.

57:54.346 --> 57:56.974
You just had a baby, let me help you.

57:56.974 --> 57:58.976
I said I'm fine.

58:02.354 --> 58:04.023
I'll get Shivaz.

58:28.005 --> 58:29.840
You don't have to suffer like this.

58:31.300 --> 58:33.886
You're a new mom and need some rest.

59:23.560 --> 59:25.854
<i>It was two days' journey home.</i>

59:27.231 --> 59:28.899
<i>Their village was so remote,</i>

59:28.899 --> 59:35.531
<i>it was one day by donkey
to the closest bus stop.</i>

59:35.531 --> 59:39.410
<i>And then, of course,
we had to wait for the bus.</i>

59:41.578 --> 59:42.871
Have some.

59:42.871 --> 59:44.331
Thank you, my dear.

59:45.082 --> 59:46.792
May you have a long life.

59:47.710 --> 59:50.212
What brings you
to our part of the country?

59:50.796 --> 59:52.965
Well, my daughter is married
to a doctor here.

59:53.674 --> 59:55.843
Dr. Jamshidpour?

59:55.843 --> 59:57.553
Yes. How did you know?

59:57.553 --> 01:00:00.014
He is the only doctor
for the entire region.

01:00:00.014 --> 01:00:04.101
A great honor for your daughter.
Is she the first or second wife?

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:07.479
What?

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:12.109
Are you the mother of the young bride
or of the old nurse?

01:00:13.986 --> 01:00:15.529
<i>First or second wife?</i>

01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:22.995
<i>We didn't give our daughter to your dad
so he could betray us.</i>

01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:26.123
What was he trying to do,
start a medieval harem?

01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:44.558
You'd think since he's an educated doctor,
it would be different.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.186
Men will be men.

01:00:47.186 --> 01:00:49.313
Even modern ones.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:53.108
A scandal in the making.

01:00:53.734 --> 01:00:55.194
What humiliation.

01:00:55.194 --> 01:00:56.445
I can't believe it.

01:01:00.908 --> 01:01:03.744
There is a time for poetry
and a time for action.

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:08.457
Your grandfather's book
would have to wait.

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:12.711
What's wrong?

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:18.175
<i>Your grandfather and uncle did what
any respectable family would do</i>

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:23.764
<i>when their daughter's husband
has decided to live like an animal.</i>

01:01:44.368 --> 01:01:45.619
Come here.

01:01:51.417 --> 01:01:53.502
What's going on?
Why are you creating a scandal?

01:01:54.753 --> 01:01:56.547
I hear you took a second wife.

01:01:56.547 --> 01:01:57.798
You damn peasant.

01:01:58.382 --> 01:02:00.300
Say goodbye to your life.

01:02:00.968 --> 01:02:01.844
Stop it!

01:02:06.598 --> 01:02:07.808
I came to America.

01:02:08.851 --> 01:02:10.644
I left everything behind.

01:02:12.104 --> 01:02:15.524
Everyone I knew, everything familiar.

01:02:16.984 --> 01:02:21.280
My food, my family, my language.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.992
So I could narrate my own story.

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:27.703
Control my own destiny.

01:02:28.871 --> 01:02:30.372
Take care of my own life.

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:34.460
Not have the gossips rule my life.

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:37.754
Now I will tell my own story.

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:45.387
<i>I wasn't going to be like my Aunt Mahdis.</i>

01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:51.935
<i>Aunt Mahdis was divorced at 17.</i>

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:57.483
<i>According to the law,
the custody went to the father.</i>

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.782
<i>She nearly went mad with grief.</i>

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:14.082
<i>Her brother, my father,
tried to cheer her up.</i>

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:17.002
<i>He gave her a bicycle
and taught her how to ride.</i>

01:03:23.592 --> 01:03:26.053
Once she learned, she never stopped.

01:03:27.888 --> 01:03:32.601
<i>Day and night, rain and sun,
winter and summer.</i>

01:03:32.601 --> 01:03:35.145
<i>Aunt Mahdis would be pedaling.</i>

01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:41.193
<i>I am not going
to ever ride a damn bicycle.</i>

01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:44.947
And I am not going to divorce this man.

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:48.534
I understand him better
than even he knows.

01:03:49.618 --> 01:03:51.662
Ours was a different story.

01:03:51.662 --> 01:03:53.705
It would have a different ending.

01:03:54.957 --> 01:03:56.500
I would make sure of that.

01:03:59.378 --> 01:04:04.758
<i>When a boy's father dies,
something changes in his soul.</i>

01:04:05.425 --> 01:04:09.388
<i>He has no male role model.</i>

01:04:09.888 --> 01:04:12.641
<i>He doesn't know
what kind of man he can become.</i>

01:04:13.392 --> 01:04:16.478
<i>My husband's father died helping the sick.</i>

01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:19.648
<i>After dying of yellow fever,
his son became the man of the house.</i>

01:04:22.734 --> 01:04:24.653
<i>His responsibility was
to protect the books.</i>

01:04:25.404 --> 01:04:28.949
<i>Books were valuable then
and needed protection.</i>

01:04:30.576 --> 01:04:35.497
<i>He protected the books,
and the books protected him.</i>

01:04:37.124 --> 01:04:38.125
I'm not afraid.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:40.085
I'm not afraid.

01:04:40.961 --> 01:04:41.962
I'm not afraid.

01:04:43.088 --> 01:04:44.089
I'm not afraid.

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:04.067
<i>When we married, I was 13 and he 22.</i>

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:05.986
<i>But inside, he was still a boy.</i>

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:11.908
<i>He had been to medical school,
but I was his intellectual equal.</i>

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:21.043
Googoosh is your age.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.920
I've never been to a concert.

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:02.417
<i>After we married,
we were sent to a most remote village.</i>

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:07.923
<i>When we arrived,
it was like they had never seen a doctor.</i>

01:06:15.055 --> 01:06:19.434
<i>But they really knew how to cook.</i>

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:30.570
<i>In the village, I only made one friend.</i>

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.657
- What's your name?
- Roya.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:44.084
Shireen,
let me show you how to do injections.

01:06:44.918 --> 01:06:45.919
I don't know how to.

01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:48.922
That's why I'm going to teach you.

01:06:48.922 --> 01:06:50.465
I've prepared this.

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:52.384
Make sure there's no air in it.

01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:55.220
You take her arm like this. Ready?

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:57.305
Give it a try.

01:07:00.392 --> 01:07:01.226
Okay.

01:07:04.104 --> 01:07:06.064
First, you pull up her sleeve.

01:07:27.002 --> 01:07:29.671
We never learned this stuff
in medical school.

01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:31.673
You'll learn.

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:33.216
If I kill someone?

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:36.011
I just graduated.

01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:38.346
They think I'm a real doctor.

01:07:38.889 --> 01:07:40.474
You are a real doctor.

01:07:40.474 --> 01:07:43.018
Not only real, but a great doctor.

01:07:45.437 --> 01:07:46.980
Thanks for encouraging me.

01:07:57.199 --> 01:07:58.450
Do we have any sugar?

01:08:09.461 --> 01:08:11.797
Could I borrow some sugar?

01:08:11.797 --> 01:08:13.089
Of course, come in.

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:21.431
I love this song.

01:08:21.431 --> 01:08:22.933
Googoosh is amazing.

01:08:31.066 --> 01:08:32.943
We heard her in concert.

01:08:32.943 --> 01:08:34.903
Lucky you.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:39.199
Let's have a tea together.

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:40.784
My husband is waiting.

01:08:40.784 --> 01:08:42.536
Just a quick tea.

01:08:59.386 --> 01:09:00.387
Sugar?

01:09:02.347 --> 01:09:03.723
Sweet, like your name.

01:09:13.692 --> 01:09:16.695
Lucky you. We don't have a radio at home.

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:18.363
We're friends now.

01:09:18.864 --> 01:09:21.199
Come listen to the radio,
even if I'm not home.

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:23.702
Music is good for the baby.

01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:25.704
Hopefully.

01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:32.085
If you have any questions
about pregnancy or birth control...

01:09:32.711 --> 01:09:33.962
don't be embarrassed.

01:09:33.962 --> 01:09:35.380
It'll stay between us.

01:09:45.807 --> 01:09:49.269
- I wish I could continue my studies.
- You still can.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:52.397
No, it's too late.

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:57.319
I was 30 when I went back to school.

01:09:58.028 --> 01:09:59.362
It wasn't late for me.

01:09:59.946 --> 01:10:01.406
How old are you?

01:10:01.406 --> 01:10:02.324
Thirty-six.

01:10:03.742 --> 01:10:05.410
You're older than my mother.

01:10:07.621 --> 01:10:08.455
You see?

01:10:09.289 --> 01:10:10.582
It's never too late.

01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:38.610
A small jug of milk and three eggs.

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:43.865
You're carrying high.

01:10:43.865 --> 01:10:45.825
You'll have a girl.

01:10:47.827 --> 01:10:48.954
Do you think so?

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:02.384
You won't believe
how much Shivaz has changed.

01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:05.428
It's amazing.

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.598
Hasn't Shivaz gotten so big?

01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:11.351
Kids grow up fast, right?

01:11:16.106 --> 01:11:16.940
I have to go.

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.274
I'll be back tonight.

01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:27.010
Have you seen Roya lately?

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:28.553
I spit on her.

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:32.182
- Why?
- You will shine pure.

01:12:32.182 --> 01:12:34.684
Even if that bitch tries
to drag you into dirt, she can't.

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:37.896
You're beautiful. You're pure.

01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:46.279
Won't you come to bed?

01:12:51.785 --> 01:12:52.619
I have to go.

01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:54.412
I have a patient.

01:15:02.332 --> 01:15:04.667
<i>I promise, one day we will dance together.</i>

01:15:21.392 --> 01:15:24.479
I'm sorry. I promise to be stronger.

01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:26.773
I'll make myself stronger.

01:15:39.911 --> 01:15:42.830
Sweetie, don't be afraid.
I'll be back for you.

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:47.835
I can't stay here anymore.
Please take care of my son.

01:15:47.835 --> 01:15:54.926
Be careful, it's a dangerous journey.

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.620
We can't turn back.

01:16:40.138 --> 01:16:41.556
Hold on a little longer.

01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:11.753
Help me, my baby's coming.

01:17:33.733 --> 01:17:36.069
The baby is stuck.

01:17:37.612 --> 01:17:38.696
Your hips are narrow.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.698
I need you to push hard.

01:17:41.199 --> 01:17:43.910
I need your help. Okay?

01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:46.162
Push.

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:48.998
Push harder.

01:17:54.462 --> 01:17:55.588
Push harder.

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:03.846
It's a girl.

01:18:04.889 --> 01:18:08.976
Let me see her.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:18.736
I'm sorry, she didn't survive.

01:18:22.657 --> 01:18:24.700
My sweet, beautiful girl.

01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:32.333
Arezoo. My love, your name will be Arezoo.

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:51.686
<i>Shireen, darling, enough.</i>

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:54.397
Give her to me.

01:19:07.452 --> 01:19:09.120
Mahdis, take her for burial.

01:19:43.196 --> 01:19:46.365
Our daughter had beautiful black hair.

01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:50.203
I'm so sorry.

01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:52.538
Forgive me.

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:56.792
Why should I?

01:19:58.252 --> 01:19:59.337
For your son.

01:20:01.088 --> 01:20:02.089
For Shivaz.

01:20:04.425 --> 01:20:05.259
Enough.

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.095
I'll take you someplace far from here.

01:20:08.596 --> 01:20:09.597
Far from gossip.

01:20:10.515 --> 01:20:11.557
We'll go to America.

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:14.393
But I need your help.

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:30.326
What?

01:20:36.082 --> 01:20:37.166
His name is Vahid.

01:20:39.627 --> 01:20:41.379
Roya died in childbirth.

01:20:41.379 --> 01:20:44.006
Never mention her name in my presence.

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:45.174
Do you understand?

01:20:46.384 --> 01:20:47.635
Vahid needs a mother.

01:20:48.678 --> 01:20:50.012
He won't take formula.

01:20:52.306 --> 01:20:54.600
Have you no shame, to ask me this?

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.227
That's my daughter's milk.

01:20:57.061 --> 01:20:59.063
This child is innocent.

01:20:59.063 --> 01:21:01.399
He's suffering, have mercy.

01:21:15.746 --> 01:21:19.625
<i>I always wanted a daughter to talk to.</i>

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:25.590
<i>One day, many years from this day,
I would give birth to her.</i>

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:33.764
<i>But when she grew up,
something strange happened.</i>

01:21:34.974 --> 01:21:37.476
<i>I couldn't talk anymore.</i>

01:21:38.811 --> 01:21:40.354
<i>When we were together, I was silent.</i>

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:43.316
I needed to be silent.

01:21:45.276 --> 01:21:46.902
<i>Silence was my strength.</i>

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:50.197
<i>It was me keeping control of my story.</i>

01:21:51.532 --> 01:21:57.121
A way of dealing with the sadness
and not being touched by it.

01:24:58.302 --> 01:24:59.637
Is she saying I became a cat?

01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:11.440
Leila isn't coming?

01:25:12.817 --> 01:25:16.070
She's running some errands for me.
She'll come by later.

01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:17.488
Okay.

01:25:25.246 --> 01:25:26.247
Congratulations.

01:25:38.259 --> 01:25:40.261
Congratulations on your wedding.

01:25:41.262 --> 01:25:42.513
You look good, Vahid.

01:25:43.097 --> 01:25:44.098
I'm better, Dad.

01:25:44.098 --> 01:25:46.559
Get going to the bachelor party.

01:25:54.024 --> 01:25:57.236
Shireen, darling, thank you.

01:25:58.028 --> 01:25:59.238
It was a good thing.

01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:02.533
He found someone who would love him.

01:26:03.576 --> 01:26:04.785
Will you forgive me?

01:26:05.786 --> 01:26:07.454
This is not a time for that.

01:26:13.627 --> 01:26:14.628
I love you.

01:26:18.424 --> 01:26:20.509
You've become so sentimental,
like the Americans.

01:26:24.388 --> 01:26:25.639
I have a lot of work.

01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:29.143
Tomorrow is the wedding. See you later.

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:56.921
The ugly guy's here.

01:26:56.921 --> 01:26:58.047
Who's the ugly guy?

01:26:58.047 --> 01:26:59.256
Mr. Ugly is here.

01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:53.894
- Shut up.
- Shut up?

01:27:56.647 --> 01:27:57.648
Shut up.

01:27:59.650 --> 01:28:00.484
Shut up.

01:28:01.151 --> 01:28:03.779
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

01:28:32.433 --> 01:28:33.892
Vahid, I'm proud of you.

01:28:37.771 --> 01:28:40.566
Thanks for everything you did for me, Mom.

01:28:44.069 --> 01:28:45.279
See you in a minute.

01:35:10.163 --> 01:35:11.164
Imam Zaman, help.

01:38:53.762 --> 01:38:55.930
Shut up. Shut up.

01:40:56.593 --> 01:40:58.219
<i>My love.</i>
