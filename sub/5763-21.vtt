00:44.067 --> 00:46.500
She's coming, hurry!

01:04.533 --> 01:08.001
That's right, come up to the attic.

01:08.034 --> 01:09.600
Drew, come.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.201
Come to us.

02:08.368 --> 02:10.400
Now you're quiet?

02:15.901 --> 02:18.101
You woke me up.

02:19.867 --> 02:21.601
Is that what he wanted?

02:21.667 --> 02:23.701
To talk to me?

02:23.734 --> 02:26.234
You have to help our family.

02:26.267 --> 02:29.601
What is it? What's wrong?

02:29.667 --> 02:32.133
We don't have our daughter. You must help us.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.467
Get our daughter.

02:33.534 --> 02:35.133
- Please find her.  - I'll try.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.567
You must do what you can.

02:36.601 --> 02:37.934
I promise.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.433
I'll do it. But you need to sleep now.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.701
You need your rest.

02:48.534 --> 02:51.634
There.

02:51.701 --> 02:54.400
Good night.

03:36.901 --> 03:39.767
I guess the no-caffeine diet's kind of killing you, right?

03:39.834 --> 03:40.667
No!

03:40.734 --> 03:42.501
It's not a problem.

03:42.567 --> 03:44.434
You didn't eat very much.

03:44.467 --> 03:45.668
Wait a minute.

03:45.734 --> 03:47.000
Are you having, like, morning sickness?

03:47.067 --> 03:49.200
No, no. Not yet. I feel great.

03:49.234 --> 03:51.367
You know, it's a beautiful day.

03:51.401 --> 03:52.467
I'm here with you.

03:52.534 --> 03:54.233
Oh, hey, about junior...

03:54.300 --> 03:55.167
Can I call him junior?

03:55.234 --> 03:57.933
You can call her anything you like.

03:57.967 --> 03:59.901
It's a girl? What, you feel like you're carrying a girl?

03:59.967 --> 04:01.401
I have no idea.

04:01.434 --> 04:02.567
Ok.

04:02.601 --> 04:04.768
Sam? Sam Lucas?

04:06.301 --> 04:09.167
Yeah, over here.

04:09.234 --> 04:10.667
That's me.

04:10.734 --> 04:12.467
Sorry. This is my first day

04:12.467 --> 04:13.601
and I gave you the wrong check.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.634
-No problem.  - I'm so lame.

04:15.668 --> 04:17.833
No problem.

04:17.899 --> 04:21.067
Really, it's no problem.

04:27.734 --> 04:29.467
So, ahh.

04:29.501 --> 04:30.900
Who do we tell about the baby?

04:30.933 --> 04:32.434
Delia.

04:32.467 --> 04:33.500
Come on, come to the store with me.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.534
We'll tell her together.

04:34.601 --> 04:35.867
No, no, no. Look, thanks,

04:35.933 --> 04:37.967
But that really seems like something

04:38.000 --> 04:39.134
You two should share alone, you know,

04:39.167 --> 04:41.200
In a high-pitched, girls only kind of way.

04:41.567 --> 04:42.668
Bye.

04:44.933 --> 04:46.900
- I can't believe it!  - I couldn't either!

04:46.967 --> 04:48.534
Oh! God, I can't stop screaming!

04:48.601 --> 04:50.267
Well, you can. You really can.

04:50.301 --> 04:52.000
- Ok, how far along are you?  - 8 weeks.

04:52.034 --> 04:53.967
8 weeks?! Are you ok?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.601
Do you feel sick?

04:55.634 --> 04:57.200
Do you know the sex?

04:57.267 --> 04:59.267
No, I'm fine, and I don't know.

04:59.301 --> 05:02.000
Oh, honey, I am so happy for you.

05:02.034 --> 05:03.200
Are you gonna get married?

05:03.267 --> 05:06.301
When are you getting married?!

05:06.334 --> 05:08.200
Haven't even thought about it.

05:08.234 --> 05:09.951
Oh, right, right.

05:09.951 --> 05:11.668
'cause it doesn't matter, does it?

05:11.701 --> 05:13.117
Well, you know, I mean,

05:13.117 --> 05:14.534
in my mind and in Jim's, too,

05:14.567 --> 05:17.100
- We are married. Oh, no!  - What?

05:17.167 --> 05:19.900
The chain, with the rings on it that I wear,

05:19.900 --> 05:21.034
it's gone!

05:21.067 --> 05:22.501
Oh, don't worry, we'll find it.

05:22.534 --> 05:23.701
It probably just fell off when I hugged you...

05:23.734 --> 05:25.567
Did I even hug you?

05:25.634 --> 05:27.234
No, you were screaming.

05:30.601 --> 05:32.000
- Excuse me.  - Come on in.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.334
Join the celebration.

05:33.367 --> 05:36.134
I'm looking for a doll, for my cousin.

05:36.167 --> 05:37.200
This is Drew.

05:38.501 --> 05:39.668
I'm Melinda, this is Delia.

05:39.701 --> 05:40.800
Hi. Welcome.

05:40.833 --> 05:44.200
I'm Emma. Anyways, Drew has some dolls.

05:44.234 --> 05:46.534
They're not exactly antiques, but they seem vintage.

05:46.567 --> 05:48.301
We've been to the toy store,

05:48.367 --> 05:50.234
But kind of an odd size.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.634
They need to fit in this chair.

05:52.701 --> 05:55.367
Wow, that is a very cool chair.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.867
She didn't want to bring them.

05:56.934 --> 05:58.200
They don't like to leave their home.

05:58.434 --> 06:00.667
I guess it doesn't matter if they match exactly,

06:00.734 --> 06:02.167
As long as they fit.

06:02.234 --> 06:03.400
And it's a girl.

06:03.434 --> 06:06.033
They only want a girl.

06:06.067 --> 06:07.834
The dolls have been talking to her.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.834
You know what, we have a lot of dolls over here,

06:10.901 --> 06:12.334
So let's go see if we can find one.

06:12.334 --> 06:13.167
Drew, right over here.

06:13.234 --> 06:15.234
Yeah, you know, and if we don't have anything,

06:15.267 --> 06:16.534
Do you know the make,

06:16.534 --> 06:17.801
or when the dollhouse was built?

06:17.834 --> 06:19.100
Oh, I don't.

06:19.133 --> 06:20.667
My cousin just found it up in the attic.

06:20.734 --> 06:22.834
Oh. Just sometimes we can go through the manufacturer,

06:24.267 --> 06:26.100
It was custom made.

06:26.133 --> 06:29.333
It's a model of the house I use to live in with my family.

06:30.667 --> 06:32.467
They died.

06:34.334 --> 06:36.633
- I'm so sorry.  - Me, too.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.267
Anyway, now I live with my aunt, Drew's mom,

06:39.300 --> 06:41.801
And...and I'm fine.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.901
It's ok. It was an accident.

06:43.934 --> 06:45.534
Carbon monoxide poisoning .

06:47.234 --> 06:48.901
I always tell people that.

06:49.167 --> 06:50.433
I don't know why.

06:50.433 --> 06:51.700
They never ask.

06:51.733 --> 06:53.267
Maybe it's because you want them to know

06:53.267 --> 06:54.801
your family didn't suffer.

06:56.068 --> 06:58.534
Yeah.

06:58.567 --> 07:00.534
Well, let's see if we can find anything.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.600
- It's Emma, right?  - Yeah.

07:19.666 --> 07:21.100
You know what, we have more dolls in the back.

07:21.267 --> 07:22.167
Why don't you come with me,

07:22.200 --> 07:23.467
And we'll see if we can find something.

07:23.501 --> 07:24.633
Ok.

07:28.766 --> 07:29.634
Any luck?

07:29.967 --> 07:31.166
No.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.834
Nothing yet.

07:34.901 --> 07:38.367
Your cousin says that your dolls are talking to you.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.033
She doesn't believe me.

07:40.066 --> 07:41.734
I do.

07:41.834 --> 07:45.700
I believe in a lot of things that other grown-ups don't.

07:45.734 --> 07:48.100
Are you sure it's your doll talking?

07:48.166 --> 07:51.433
Have you seen anyone else? You know, maybe somebody...

07:51.500 --> 07:54.100
that others can't see?

07:54.200 --> 07:55.233
No.

07:55.267 --> 07:56.901
Ok.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.967
So your dolls, what do they say to you?

08:01.033 --> 08:02.867
They're sad.

08:02.901 --> 08:04.033
Why?

08:04.066 --> 08:05.634
They miss their daughter.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.634
She wants a girl.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.133
They want her with them.

08:49.867 --> 08:51.567
I went online. It's true,

08:51.634 --> 08:54.967
Emma lost her family 3 years ago to carbon monoxide poisoning.

08:54.967 --> 08:55.934
They all died in their sleep.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.400
Leading cause of poison death in the U.S.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.833
Hey, I'm gonna get you a carbon monoxide detector

09:00.867 --> 09:02.067
for your shower present.

09:02.134 --> 09:03.900
Shower? You mean a baby shower?

09:03.967 --> 09:05.566
I already called Delia about it.

09:05.633 --> 09:07.234
You're planning my baby shower?

09:07.301 --> 09:08.466
Mango and berry, please.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.134
What, you don't think a man can do that?

09:10.167 --> 09:13.067
I can buy streamers and mix martinis as well as she can.

09:13.134 --> 09:16.466
Ok, but in the meantime, which there's plenty of,

09:16.500 --> 09:18.234
What did you find out from Detective Blair?

09:18.301 --> 09:19.934
You mean about the vision you have

09:20.000 --> 09:21.267
About someone slicing their wrist?

09:21.334 --> 09:23.000
Look, I know that their deaths could have been an accident,

09:23.034 --> 09:24.500
But what if they weren't?

09:24.500 --> 09:26.833
Oh, you're thinking murder-suicide.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.333
Somebody got so depressed that they took down their whole family?

09:29.367 --> 09:31.301
- I don't think so.  - What makes you so sure?

09:31.367 --> 09:33.533
Well, according to the medical examiner's reports,

09:33.566 --> 09:35.867
There were no marks on any of the bodies.

09:35.900 --> 09:39.167
Ok, so what about scars? There could have been an earlier attempt.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.067
Yeah, I asked about that specifically.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.334
They said that they were looking for the same thing...

09:43.367 --> 09:45.500
Suicidal tendencies, abuse.

09:45.533 --> 09:47.200
Could Emma be suicidal?

09:47.234 --> 09:49.500
Yeah, surviving the death of your whole family

09:49.533 --> 09:50.833
Would be hard to live with.

09:50.867 --> 09:51.867
Yeah, but they died 3 years ago,

09:51.900 --> 09:53.533
So why are they haunting her now?

09:53.566 --> 09:56.200
They're not. They're haunting the little girl, her cousin.

09:56.234 --> 09:58.800
Yeah, but that's only because she's young enough to still hear them.

09:58.867 --> 10:00.267
It doesn't tell us what they want.

10:00.334 --> 10:03.034
I thought they want their daughter with them,

10:03.067 --> 10:05.167
which is a nice sentiment, but they're dead.

10:05.234 --> 10:07.533
And if Emma keeps taking a slice at her wrists,

10:07.566 --> 10:08.833
They won't be waiting long.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.234
Yeah, I should get over there.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.334
I can't believe you found one.

10:20.401 --> 10:21.600
Thank you.

10:21.633 --> 10:22.700
You're welcome.

10:22.733 --> 10:24.800
I hope your other dolls like her.

10:26.034 --> 10:27.367
There you go.

10:27.401 --> 10:30.301
This is your new home.

10:30.367 --> 10:32.134
And you guys,

10:32.200 --> 10:35.100
This is...Ava.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.267
No.

10:36.301 --> 10:38.433
Chelsea. Wait.

10:39.166 --> 10:40.767
Daisy.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.167
She can be your daughter.

10:43.234 --> 10:45.334
So? What'd they say.

10:46.934 --> 10:48.167
Nothing.

10:48.234 --> 10:50.134
They don't talk when other people are around.

10:50.167 --> 10:51.833
But watch.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.500
When we come back,

10:53.566 --> 10:54.733
they'll be right where they always are.

10:54.767 --> 10:55.900
Where's that?

10:55.934 --> 10:58.167
The mom and the kids all go to their beds.

10:58.234 --> 10:59.367
And no matter what,

10:59.433 --> 11:01.100
the father ends up on the dining room floor.

11:01.134 --> 11:04.200
- Lying down?  - Like he's sleeping.

11:04.267 --> 11:06.900
But he doesn't look very comfortable.

11:06.967 --> 11:10.733
So you're saying that they move themselves?

11:10.800 --> 11:11.934
Yeah.

11:11.967 --> 11:13.934
And when did they first start talking to you?

11:13.967 --> 11:16.234
I don't know.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.934
Pretty soon after I found them.

11:17.967 --> 11:19.700
The dollhouse was all covered up.

11:19.767 --> 11:21.267
But I heard them.

11:21.301 --> 11:23.334
How long ago was that?

11:23.367 --> 11:24.633
2 days ago.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.934
I was up here looking for a birthday present. For Emma.

11:27.334 --> 11:28.934
She's going to be 18.

11:28.967 --> 11:31.301
Drew, what are you doing up here?

11:33.466 --> 11:35.433
I wasn't playing with it.

11:35.466 --> 11:36.833
Melinda brought me a new doll.

11:36.900 --> 11:38.867
I was just putting it in there.

11:38.967 --> 11:40.767
I'm Lucy Stanton, Drew's mother.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.500
Hi. Melinda Gordon. I have a store in town,

11:43.534 --> 11:45.333
And your daughter and niece came by.

11:45.366 --> 11:47.233
Yes. The sitter told me.

11:47.300 --> 11:50.034
Drew, out of this attic.

11:50.134 --> 11:51.433
Now.

11:53.901 --> 11:56.233
If you don't mind.

11:59.701 --> 12:00.801
Who is this? What is that?

12:00.866 --> 12:01.801
That's not our daughter.

12:01.866 --> 12:03.033
Get rid of it.

12:05.767 --> 12:06.834
I spoke to Emma.

12:06.967 --> 12:08.500
She told me how she came to live with you.

12:08.533 --> 12:11.233
Is that why you kept the dollhouse hidden away?

12:11.300 --> 12:13.266
Emma told you that?

12:13.266 --> 12:16.834
No, she just said that it was a replica of her family home.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.134
It was.

12:18.167 --> 12:20.834
It's gone now.

12:20.867 --> 12:22.467
When my brother...

12:22.500 --> 12:24.167
When the family died,

12:24.201 --> 12:26.500
I was the only living relative.

12:26.533 --> 12:28.734
And Emma...

12:28.800 --> 12:30.433
I barely knew her.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.800
My brother and I weren't close.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.134
We'd had a falling out years ago.

12:33.167 --> 12:35.300
- I'm sorry.  - I am, too.

12:35.534 --> 12:38.367
Anyway, Drew and I packed up and we moved into the house,

12:38.400 --> 12:40.033
to try and keep things the same for Emma,

12:40.100 --> 12:43.100
But there were back taxes and the estate couldn't cover it.

12:43.133 --> 12:45.300
A developed made an offer, and I took it.

12:45.334 --> 12:46.900
They subdivided the property

12:46.966 --> 12:48.933
And they tore down the house.

12:48.966 --> 12:50.634
And that's why you kept the dollhouse?

12:51.866 --> 12:53.434
I've had it tucked away upstairs.

12:53.467 --> 12:55.667
I didn't think anyone would find it.

12:57.201 --> 13:01.200
Obviously it has some painful memories for Emma, but...

13:01.366 --> 13:02.700
I can't part with it.

13:02.934 --> 13:05.433
And there's a chance she may want it someday.

13:05.466 --> 13:08.301
If not for herself, then for her children.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.466
This may sound odd,

13:12.533 --> 13:14.034
Coming from a complete stranger,

13:14.067 --> 13:16.301
But has anything happened recently?

13:16.367 --> 13:20.134
Anything that might make you worry about Emma?

13:20.200 --> 13:21.900
I worry about Emma all the time.

13:21.934 --> 13:24.566
I'm sure if her parents were alive, they'd worry about her, too.

13:38.634 --> 13:41.634
You're wrong, all of you.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.967
She's nice.

13:44.001 --> 13:46.967
She would not do that.

13:47.001 --> 13:49.133
She wasn't there.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.467
Drew.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.934
You know your mom doesn't want you playing with that.

13:55.967 --> 13:57.534
And neither do I.

13:57.667 --> 13:59.367
Go on downstairs.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.400
Quick, come here!

14:21.467 --> 14:22.600
What? Emma's here!

14:22.667 --> 14:24.101
Hurry, hurry!

14:24.166 --> 14:25.034
Where are you?

14:25.034 --> 14:26.067
I'm upstairs

14:26.067 --> 14:27.400
Don't let her go!

14:27.433 --> 14:28.133
What's happening?

14:28.200 --> 14:30.000
She's here. Don't let her go.

14:31.134 --> 14:32.700
Lock her in! Lock her in!

14:32.834 --> 14:33.901
No!

14:34.801 --> 14:35.966
No!

14:36.166 --> 14:37.800
Drew! Come on!

14:37.867 --> 14:40.233
Get me out of here!

14:42.133 --> 14:43.333
Hurry, Drew!

14:45.867 --> 14:48.767
Drew said you were asking questions about the house.

14:48.833 --> 14:50.833
That it seemed like if you didn't know things,

14:50.867 --> 14:52.733
That you understood.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.700
I'm trying to.

14:54.733 --> 14:56.267
Could you explain it to me?

14:56.334 --> 14:59.767
Because I swear it's like they locked me up in that attic.

14:59.833 --> 15:03.000
That's why I had it brought over here.

15:03.034 --> 15:06.800
When you saw Drew with the dolls, 
what was she saying?

15:06.867 --> 15:09.300
It was like she was defending someone,

15:09.367 --> 15:12.267
Saying she wasn't there.

15:12.334 --> 15:14.666
I think she was talking to your family.

15:14.700 --> 15:17.433
My family's dead.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.800
I think their spirits are attached to that house.

15:19.867 --> 15:21.867
Their spirits?

15:21.900 --> 15:23.800
Their ghosts.

15:23.867 --> 15:25.733
And I think that they're using the dolls

15:25.767 --> 15:27.067
To tell us something.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.667
Why didn't she get rid of that thing?

15:29.700 --> 15:32.100
She doesn't want it. She can't stand Drew playing with it.

15:32.167 --> 15:33.333
Are you talking about your aunt?

15:33.366 --> 15:35.267
Because she said that she was saving it for you.

15:35.333 --> 15:37.301
For me? Why would I want it?

15:37.366 --> 15:38.900
Because it belonged to your family.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.633
No, it didn't.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.100
It belonged to that house.

15:42.167 --> 15:43.466
What do you mean?

15:43.533 --> 15:45.700
I don't know, I thought some family before us

15:45.733 --> 15:46.834
Had it made.

15:46.867 --> 15:49.767
Because I never saw it until Drew found it.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.733
Look, I see things.

15:53.767 --> 15:54.867
Things that have happened,

15:54.900 --> 15:57.000
And I had a vision about your family.

15:57.067 --> 15:59.034
What did you see?

15:59.067 --> 16:00.867
Someone.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.301
Cutting their wrist.

16:04.867 --> 16:06.567
Wait a minute.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.567
You think that was me?

16:09.600 --> 16:13.834
Look, spirits stay with us sometimes out of love,

16:13.900 --> 16:15.867
Concern,

16:15.900 --> 16:18.433
Or guilt.

16:18.466 --> 16:22.134
I feel terrible about what happened.

16:22.201 --> 16:24.466
My family died for nothing,

16:24.500 --> 16:27.333
Because of some heating valve.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.134
And I got to live.

16:32.267 --> 16:35.301
But I would never hurt myself.

16:35.333 --> 16:38.700
If they're worried, tell them that.

16:38.767 --> 16:41.433
I would never dishonor them that way.

16:48.699 --> 16:49.976
I've gotta find those rings.

16:50.301 --> 16:52.433
You've checked everywhere else?

16:52.466 --> 16:54.501
Everywhere! And I can't tell Jim

16:54.533 --> 16:55.700
Because they're our wedding bands.

16:55.767 --> 16:57.667
So where do you want me to check next?

16:57.700 --> 16:59.833
I don't know. I've searched the whole house,

16:59.867 --> 17:01.533
And now I have to get it fixed back up again

17:01.600 --> 17:03.600
Before he gets home.

17:03.633 --> 17:06.967
So, how's it going with your little friends?

17:07.000 --> 17:08.767
Oh, you mean the dolls?

17:08.800 --> 17:10.034
Yeah, what do they want?

17:10.099 --> 17:13.465
Well, at first I thought they were blaming Emma for something.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.599
Yeah, and now?

17:14.633 --> 17:15.967
Well, I don't think so.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.300
You said the aunt lied about the dollhouse?

17:17.333 --> 17:19.900
No, I said that the niece had never seen it before.

17:19.967 --> 17:21.532
Ok, so how weird is that? You know?

17:21.599 --> 17:23.566
She finds a dollhouse.

17:23.567 --> 17:25.532
It's the exact replica of the girl's home,

17:25.599 --> 17:26.767
And she never shows it to her?

17:26.800 --> 17:28.034
Well, it was sensitive.

17:28.099 --> 17:29.567
You know, I mean, Emma's family died there.

17:29.633 --> 17:32.301
The thing's destroyed by developers.

17:32.333 --> 17:34.900
Developers didn't destroy it, the aunt did.

17:34.967 --> 17:37.000
- What?  - Yeah.

17:37.034 --> 17:38.061
I know that house.

17:38.061 --> 17:40.331
I used to have a bunch of listings up in that area.

17:40.331 --> 17:42.933
The whole neighborhood was in this uproar.

17:42.967 --> 17:45.500
No, no, no, no. It was subdivided for back taxes or something.

17:45.533 --> 17:47.433
- The house?  - Yeah.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.466
No, that doesn't make any sense.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.900
The family was loaded. You can check out the estate.

17:51.967 --> 17:53.700
It's public record.

17:53.733 --> 17:56.400
Ok, so then why would she destroy it?

17:56.466 --> 17:58.767
That's a good question.

17:58.834 --> 18:01.067
And what else is she lying about?

18:18.800 --> 18:20.300
Where is it?

18:20.367 --> 18:22.133
What?

18:22.200 --> 18:23.300
The dollhouse.

18:23.567 --> 18:24.700
What have you done with it?

18:24.767 --> 18:26.366
What difference does it make?

18:26.433 --> 18:28.401
What is the matter with you?

18:28.466 --> 18:30.134
Drew said she saw you packing it up.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.833
Ever since she found it up there,

18:31.866 --> 18:33.067
You've been such a bitch.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.167
Tell me where it is.

18:36.034 --> 18:38.700
You mean, my dollhouse?

18:38.933 --> 18:41.833
My cherished girlhood item?

18:43.267 --> 18:46.067
That's what you told that lady at the antique store.

18:46.100 --> 18:48.100
Why did you lie?

18:48.134 --> 18:50.666
What is it about that thing?

18:50.733 --> 18:52.667
Why do you even care?

18:52.733 --> 18:54.867
Why did you even agree to take me in?

18:55.400 --> 18:58.200
Do you have any idea what I have done for this family?

18:58.233 --> 19:00.634
Because of you!

19:05.267 --> 19:07.634
The dolls are not in the same place they were before.

19:07.667 --> 19:09.133
Yep.

19:09.867 --> 19:12.267
What, they just move themselves?

19:12.334 --> 19:13.900
Apparently.

19:13.967 --> 19:16.400
Oh, that is so weird.

19:16.467 --> 19:19.234
Are you gonna talk to the aunt?

19:19.300 --> 19:21.601
Well, since she's a liar, what's the point?

19:21.667 --> 19:22.833
I was hoping my friends would help me,

19:22.866 --> 19:26.100
If they want to stop freaking out their daughter.

19:26.167 --> 19:27.833
Are they here, right now?

19:27.866 --> 19:30.067
Well, I think this is home, sweet home.

19:31.167 --> 19:32.500
Do you want me to stay?

19:32.534 --> 19:34.300
No, I'm fine, thanks.

19:34.334 --> 19:36.701
Are you sure? Because I'm gonna go home

19:36.733 --> 19:37.733
All right.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.500
Good night.

20:01.866 --> 20:03.467
What do you want?

20:03.534 --> 20:05.467
What are you trying to tell me?

20:17.667 --> 20:19.800
I can't hear what you're saying.

20:19.866 --> 20:21.400
We kept our deal.

20:21.434 --> 20:23.834
Why isn't she keeping hers?

20:25.700 --> 20:27.734
Who did you make a deal with?

20:27.767 --> 20:29.700
With Lucy?

20:39.034 --> 20:40.501
I don't understand.

20:40.833 --> 20:43.100
If people break promises,

20:43.167 --> 20:45.567
Promises will break them.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.333
Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Gordon,

21:06.400 --> 21:07.934
I'm here about a dollhouse.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.200
Sorry, this one's off the market.

21:10.833 --> 21:14.367
And how is everybody today?

21:15.766 --> 21:17.633
Not too chatty.

21:17.666 --> 21:20.733
No, not since they told me about some deal they made

21:20.766 --> 21:23.367
And showed me images of aunt Lucy cutting her wrist.

21:23.434 --> 21:24.500
You think the ghosts are trying to tell you

21:24.533 --> 21:25.633
That the aunt's in trouble.

21:25.700 --> 21:27.250
Well, they sounded angry,

21:27.251 --> 21:29.033
like she had broken some sort of promise.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.534
And then there's something else.

21:30.601 --> 21:32.633
This where she cut her wrist.

21:34.067 --> 21:36.200
Was she teeny-weeny?

21:36.267 --> 21:38.933
No. She was in the real house when I saw her.

21:38.967 --> 21:41.367
The walls were the same, the furniture,

21:41.434 --> 21:43.400
Which made me notice that in each room,

21:43.434 --> 21:45.167
Some of the parts were from the original house.

21:45.201 --> 21:46.534
You mean the house they were living in.

21:46.667 --> 21:48.166
Yeah, the one that the aunt had demolished.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.767
But look, the bedspread and the draperies,

21:49.833 --> 21:51.300
They're actually cut from the originals.

21:51.666 --> 21:53.600
The actual fabric.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.467
Oh, boy.

21:59.634 --> 22:02.101
- Is that hair?   - Human hair.

22:02.133 --> 22:05.034
It's wrapped around some of the other furniture, too.

22:05.101 --> 22:07.634
You said the dolls were talking to you about making deals,

22:07.667 --> 22:09.267
- Promises? - Yeah.

22:09.334 --> 22:10.900
You saw the aunt spill her own blood.

22:10.966 --> 22:12.234
Any idea what she did with it?

22:12.367 --> 22:13.467
Did with it?

22:13.500 --> 22:15.033
I think she was making a sacrifice...

22:15.100 --> 22:16.767
Maybe sealing the deal.

22:17.234 --> 22:19.334
Maybe sealing them in.

22:20.533 --> 22:23.000
Well, the blood makes kind of a paste.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.301
They say it glues the spirit's will to the practioner's.

22:26.334 --> 22:29.700
Rockland university is actually paying you to teach this stuff,Zoe?

22:29.867 --> 22:31.467
I'm giving a lecture in 20 minutes.

22:31.534 --> 22:33.052
Although I doubt you'd get a seat.

22:33.053 --> 22:34.067
It's a packed house.

22:34.134 --> 22:36.133
Thanks. I've heard enough of your lectures.

22:36.166 --> 22:38.266
And you were never usually very interested.

22:38.333 --> 22:39.834
What's changed?

22:39.867 --> 22:41.467
It's for a patient. Do you mind?

22:43.333 --> 22:45.900
Hey, you remember that time that I was grinding up

22:45.967 --> 22:47.800
All the egg shells with the fake blood?

22:47.834 --> 22:49.433
For your Haitian voodoo thesis?

22:49.500 --> 22:51.533
Vodou. In Haiti, it's "vodou."

22:51.567 --> 22:55.001
Ah, grad school. Good times.

22:55.034 --> 22:57.934
So, who's your voodoo priestess?

22:58.001 --> 23:00.500
Well, I wouldn't exactly call her a priestess.

23:00.533 --> 23:02.834
But...ha! You said "voodoo."

23:02.867 --> 23:04.800
It's the new orleans pronunciation. Mm-hmm.

23:04.867 --> 23:07.533
The blood, the artifacts, it sounds domestic.

23:07.567 --> 23:09.500
Spirit house?

23:09.533 --> 23:12.101
The dollhouse? You said this lady, what was her name?

23:12.166 --> 23:13.467
Let's just call her aunt Lucy.

23:13.533 --> 23:15.333
Because that's her name, and she's an aunt.

23:15.367 --> 23:17.934
She demolished their real home, right?

23:18.001 --> 23:19.367
And now they have no place to go?

23:19.400 --> 23:21.700
Well, ghosts can live anywhere. Can't they?

23:21.734 --> 23:23.934
Well, there's one school of thought

23:24.001 --> 23:25.767
That if they can't return to the original place of their death,

23:25.834 --> 23:28.233
Wherever that is, that they'll be lost,

23:28.266 --> 23:32.124
Wandering the earth, unrecognizable to even other spirits for

23:32.167 --> 23:33.567
eternity.

23:34.734 --> 23:36.533
That's a bunch of hooey.

23:36.567 --> 23:37.667
Well, it probably is.

23:37.734 --> 23:39.067
Which is why what this lady did,

23:39.101 --> 23:40.667
It could have had the opposite effect.

23:40.734 --> 23:42.467
What do you mean?

23:42.533 --> 23:44.634
Well, she took a bunch of angry spirits,

23:44.700 --> 23:46.967
She tricked them and then bottled them up.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.700
That only makes them stronger.

23:48.734 --> 23:51.200
- And angrier?  - It would me.

23:51.233 --> 23:52.734
At some point, they're going to bust out,

23:52.767 --> 23:55.834
And when they do, it's not going to be pretty.

23:55.900 --> 23:58.067
Good luck.

24:02.567 --> 24:03.867
Hello?

24:03.934 --> 24:05.266
I hear traffic.

24:05.300 --> 24:07.001
Oh, I had to go by the archives.

24:07.067 --> 24:09.333
- What did you find out? - It's voodoo.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.634
Vodou. I don't know, however you want to call it.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.834
Lucy did something to trap the spirits in there.

24:13.900 --> 24:15.500
Well, you can't trap a spirit,

24:15.600 --> 24:16.727
But you can trick 'em.

24:16.731 --> 24:18.798
By making them think they can't exist outside their home.

24:18.864 --> 24:21.718
Well, she sure went to a lot of trouble to try to contain them.

24:21.783 --> 24:22.768
Exactly.

24:22.768 --> 24:24.953
Which means they must have been haunting the crap out of her.

24:25.017 --> 24:26.154
But why?

24:26.219 --> 24:27.961
Well, they probably know she wants the money.

24:28.028 --> 24:30.154
- There's money?  - Yeah, a lot.

24:30.219 --> 24:32.121
Delia told me that the family was loaded

24:32.186 --> 24:33.498
And the aunt was crying broke.

24:33.563 --> 24:35.899
I thought it was just another lie, so I researched it.

24:35.965 --> 24:37.498
That's a weird lie.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.129
I like people to think I'm rich.

24:39.195 --> 24:40.664
Yeah, well, she's not rich.

24:40.762 --> 24:42.167
There's money. Family money.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.136
It's the brother's, and then it goes to his kids.

24:44.201 --> 24:45.304
Uh, singular.

24:45.368 --> 24:46.776
Kid. It's just Emma now.

24:46.842 --> 24:49.045
Uh, no, actually, Lucy gets the money

24:49.045 --> 24:50.648
once all of his kids die.

24:50.713 --> 24:52.615
Wait a minute, you're not... you don't think...

24:52.680 --> 24:54.280
I mean, it was an accident.

24:54.345 --> 24:56.517
You're not saying that she actually killed them?

24:56.584 --> 24:58.415
There's a reason they all keep going back

24:58.415 --> 25:00.247
to the night of their death.

25:00.312 --> 25:02.214
The dolls snapping back to their positions.

25:02.278 --> 25:03.814
But the aunt is managing the huge estate.

25:03.895 --> 25:06.053
She must be getting something for the trouble.

25:06.118 --> 25:07.750
Yeah, she is. Until Emma turns 18,

25:07.831 --> 25:09.462
And then she gets everything.

25:09.527 --> 25:10.758
And Lucy gets nothing.

25:10.823 --> 25:13.367
Maybe that's why they trapped her in the attic.

25:13.431 --> 25:15.366
Maybe they were trying to protect her.

25:15.432 --> 25:17.526
Listen, I gotta go.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.235
Drew, are you home?

25:22.870 --> 25:25.013
Drew?

25:25.077 --> 25:26.870
Are you up there again?

25:34.552 --> 25:36.617
Drew!

25:47.000 --> 25:49.612
Stop it, whatever you are, please!

26:22.226 --> 26:25.462
Get out. You're next

26:30.706 --> 26:32.704
Good, you're home.

26:32.985 --> 26:35.784
Drew, the dolls up in the attic?

26:35.849 --> 26:38.247
I believe you now that they have been talking to you.

26:38.312 --> 26:40.311
What have they been telling you?

26:40.392 --> 26:42.023
I can't tell you.

26:42.088 --> 26:44.390
Drew, you have to.

26:44.455 --> 26:46.918
They're trying to warn me about something.

26:46.984 --> 26:49.797
They're only dolls!

26:49.863 --> 26:51.452
They're just mad at her because she

26:51.452 --> 26:53.268
Doesn't want me playing with the house.

26:53.334 --> 26:55.059
Mad at your mother?

26:55.125 --> 26:56.963
She just doesn't want me to break it.

26:57.028 --> 26:58.595
It's fragile.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.102
It's the antique.

27:00.167 --> 27:03.602
Drew, don't you know who they are?

27:03.667 --> 27:06.737
That was my house.

27:06.802 --> 27:08.544
The house my family all lived in.

27:08.608 --> 27:11.408
But they're just dolls.

27:11.473 --> 27:13.280
Who can talk, right?

27:13.345 --> 27:16.975
Because they are my family!

27:17.040 --> 27:20.942
Their spirits live in those dolls.

27:21.023 --> 27:23.390
Please.

27:23.456 --> 27:26.079
What did they say?

27:27.728 --> 27:29.551
They said my mom hurt them.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.792
And she's gonna hurt you.

27:37.601 --> 27:39.264
Oh, my god, that explains it.

27:42.610 --> 27:44.944
That's why she was surprised to see me alive that night.

27:50.416 --> 27:53.952
Listen, um, I gotta go.

27:55.185 --> 27:56.656
You know my cell phone number, right?

27:56.922 --> 27:59.112
- You sure?  - I'm sure.

27:59.194 --> 28:01.385
You're going to be ok.

28:01.451 --> 28:02.921
You're her daughter.

28:02.986 --> 28:04.889
But if anything ever happens,

28:04.953 --> 28:06.393
If you ever get scared, call me, ok?

28:06.459 --> 28:08.257
Ok.

28:10.194 --> 28:11.399
Bye.

28:51.597 --> 29:01.562
Mom? Dad? Are you here?

29:01.843 --> 29:02.866
Yes, honey.

29:02.931 --> 29:05.314
And we love you very much.

29:25.760 --> 29:27.551
It's ok.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.887
She'll be safe now.

29:33.664 --> 29:36.003
Honey, we have to go back.

29:36.268 --> 29:38.074
If we don't, Lucy will know.

29:42.875 --> 29:44.377
Hey, Ned. Thanks for watching the store.

29:44.441 --> 29:45.913
There's just one more thing I have to do.

29:45.977 --> 29:47.337
Sure. No problem.

29:47.402 --> 29:49.321
No sales, but someone came by

29:49.321 --> 29:52.840
and took that huge dollhouse off of consignment.

29:53.621 --> 29:55.476
The dollhouse?

29:55.555 --> 29:57.716
Yeah.

29:57.782 --> 30:00.915
Don't tell me, is that what you were going downstairs for?

30:00.981 --> 30:04.160
The lady said that it was hers, that she needed it.

30:04.224 --> 30:05.390
Lucy.

30:05.456 --> 30:07.263
Yeah, that was her name.

30:07.328 --> 30:09.060
Did I make a mistake?

30:09.064 --> 30:10.031
I'll be back.

30:14.967 --> 30:17.541
Drew...

31:56.859 --> 31:58.953
Drew?

32:00.353 --> 32:01.353
Emma?

32:10.073 --> 32:11.574
Drew?

32:11.641 --> 32:14.376
Sweetie?

32:14.441 --> 32:17.048
What is it?

32:17.113 --> 32:19.785
I'm scared.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.641
Of what?

32:23.690 --> 32:25.481
Of you.

32:32.027 --> 32:33.994
Oh, god. They're out. Drew!

32:36.428 --> 32:38.731
We have to leave!

32:39.332 --> 32:41.604
Drew? Drew.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.008
What's happening?

32:43.972 --> 32:44.511
Let her go.

32:44.576 --> 32:46.338
You think she needs protection from me?

32:46.404 --> 32:47.448
It's your family!

32:47.513 --> 32:48.516
What did you do to them?!

32:48.581 --> 32:51.220
- Nothing. Tell them to leave me alone.  - No!

32:51.285 --> 32:53.509
Drew, come on! You'll be safe, ok?

32:53.589 --> 32:54.999
- No, no!  - Stop!

32:55.087 --> 32:57.581
Stop it, do you hear me? Or I will kill her!

32:57.661 --> 32:59.259
Mommy!

33:02.165 --> 33:04.948
- Stop it, do you hear me?!  - No!

33:05.013 --> 33:06.948
Let Emma go, mom. Let her go.

33:07.012 --> 33:08.276
Mom!

33:08.341 --> 33:09.972
Stop...

33:10.253 --> 33:11.548
Come here.

33:14.589 --> 33:15.883
I didn't do anything!

33:15.949 --> 33:17.020
I never did anything!

33:17.385 --> 33:18.551
We saw you.

33:18.917 --> 33:21.016
Please just stop, ok?

33:21.097 --> 33:23.151
Your brother is here, and his family.

33:23.233 --> 33:24.720
Just please, I can help you.

33:25.001 --> 33:27.432
Just tell me what happened, whatever deal you made,

33:27.496 --> 33:29.623
Or whatever promise, it doesn't matter.

33:29.704 --> 33:31.191
If we don't stay in there,

33:31.271 --> 33:32.839
She'll destroy the dollhouse.

33:32.904 --> 33:35.032
It doesn't matter, it won't destroy you.

33:35.096 --> 33:37.735
I know that she said that, but it's not true.

33:37.800 --> 33:40.039
Just tell me what happened. You said that you saw her.

33:40.104 --> 33:42.239
The night we died, you were there.

33:43.303 --> 33:44.741
It was cold that night,

33:46.407 --> 33:48.006
And I kept pushing up the heat,

33:48.071 --> 33:49.682
But it didn't get warmer.

33:56.192 --> 33:58.255
Everyone went to bed very early.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.292
We were all feeling very sluggish.

34:00.357 --> 34:02.692
I thought we were coming down with something,

34:02.757 --> 34:04.997
the flu or...

34:05.062 --> 34:07.941
Good night, boys. Sleep well.

34:08.005 --> 34:09.869
I couldn't keep my eyes open,

34:09.870 --> 34:13.380
I was falling asleep so fast. Too fast.

34:27.462 --> 34:29.860
That's when I saw her.

34:31.621 --> 34:34.902
Moving from window to window,

34:34.967 --> 34:36.598
making sure she got us all.

34:38.663 --> 34:39.638
And for what?

34:39.703 --> 34:40.869
Money?

34:40.935 --> 34:42.598
Money I'd have given her

34:42.663 --> 34:45.333
if she hadn't been too proud to ask for it.

34:45.398 --> 34:46.837
Our parents cut you out, I never did.

34:46.902 --> 34:49.205
Wait, wait, wait. Something's wrong.

34:49.270 --> 34:51.045
He thinks that you killed him,

34:51.110 --> 34:54.308
All of them, for your family's money.

34:54.373 --> 34:57.588
He said that he saw you outside the windows that night.

34:57.653 --> 35:00.644
I was trying to help Emma.

35:03.125 --> 35:07.920
I saw a girl that night, coming out of a club.

35:08.085 --> 35:10.100
She was maybe 15.

35:10.165 --> 35:11.332
She was with an older boy,

35:11.397 --> 35:14.028
they were drinking. I thought it was Emma,

35:14.093 --> 35:16.331
But I couldn't be sure. It had been so long.

35:16.397 --> 35:18.572
I hadn't talked to my brother in years,

35:18.637 --> 35:21.306
And that was because of the money, it's true.

35:21.371 --> 35:23.244
But I was so worried.

35:23.409 --> 35:25.276
And when they didn't answer,

35:25.340 --> 35:27.336
I drove by.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.118
It seemed like they were sleeping,

35:34.183 --> 35:36.246
And I didn't want to wake them.

35:39.410 --> 35:42.217
And I found Emma's room.

35:42.290 --> 35:45.024
She was there. In bed.

35:45.989 --> 35:48.496
And I thought, ok, it wasn't her.

35:48.561 --> 35:50.560
Everything's all right.

35:51.225 --> 35:54.504
I was wrong.

35:54.567 --> 35:56.558
When I got the call, I realized

35:56.559 --> 36:01.177
when I'd seen them, they were dead or dying.

36:01.242 --> 36:04.106
And yet there she was. I couldn't believe my eyes.

36:11.624 --> 36:15.326
They're gone. I can't believe they're gone.

36:15.391 --> 36:18.062
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

36:20.925 --> 36:22.921
And you didn't want to tell the police that you've been there,

36:22.986 --> 36:24.725
because then you would have to tell them why.

36:26.090 --> 36:27.228
Emma told the police she was

36:27.229 --> 36:28.693
spending the night with the girl friends

36:28.758 --> 36:30.101
And she'd come home early.

36:30.166 --> 36:32.163
When I was 15, I packed my bed with pillows

36:32.229 --> 36:35.268
And snuck off to see a boy I liked, too.

36:37.077 --> 36:39.780
But it didn't cost you your family.

36:41.477 --> 36:43.012
I should have been with them.

36:44.177 --> 36:46.080
I belonged with them!

36:46.145 --> 36:47.615
No!

36:47.680 --> 36:51.008
Emma, that is the last thing your parents would want.

36:51.088 --> 36:53.279
This is not your fault.

36:53.344 --> 36:57.118
You couldn't have saved them, even if you were there.

36:58.327 --> 37:01.198
All that matters is that you were here now.

37:01.263 --> 37:04.622
You are all that I have left of him!

37:04.687 --> 37:08.525
When we were kids, we were so close.

37:08.589 --> 37:11.436
Baby, I'm so sorry.

37:11.500 --> 37:15.164
I was so scared, but I never meant to hurt you.

37:15.229 --> 37:17.964
I would never hurt either of you.

37:19.772 --> 37:21.241
It's all right now.

37:21.307 --> 37:24.875
That's all right.

37:24.939 --> 37:26.778
We were angry.

37:26.843 --> 37:28.314
She was in our home.

37:28.379 --> 37:31.353
Raising a child we thought she wanted to...

37:31.417 --> 37:34.489
We thought you were going to hurt her.

37:34.554 --> 37:36.249
That's why you've been trapped.

37:36.314 --> 37:39.592
Not because of some magic spell.

37:39.658 --> 37:41.593
It's not your fault.

37:41.657 --> 37:43.960
You didn't leave her.

37:45.401 --> 37:47.527
You didn't leave her alone.

37:47.592 --> 37:49.335
She'll never be alone.

37:51.272 --> 37:53.497
Mom, there it is again.

37:53.863 --> 37:55.622
The light.

37:57.110 --> 37:58.804
Oh, honey.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.203
Tell Lucy we're sorry.

38:01.268 --> 38:03.875
Tell them all we love them very much.

38:03.941 --> 38:06.209
I will.

38:15.186 --> 38:17.121
They're gone.

38:23.698 --> 38:25.856
Thank you.

38:50.653 --> 38:52.316
Where are those rings?

39:11.594 --> 39:14.201
Please, please!

39:30.185 --> 39:32.180
Hey there.

39:32.245 --> 39:33.876
I was coming to see if you wanted to have dinner.

39:33.957 --> 39:36.548
But, uh, is this an invitation?

39:38.293 --> 39:40.692
I'm stuck.

39:40.758 --> 39:43.988
Really?! Sorry! Oh, hang on.

39:58.580 --> 40:00.211
What's wrong?

40:02.244 --> 40:04.083
I lost our wedding bands.

40:04.149 --> 40:06.308
Oh. And I've looked everywhere.

40:06.372 --> 40:08.147
I mean, I tore the house apart.

40:08.212 --> 40:09.411
That's why the silverware drawer was on top of the oven.

40:09.476 --> 40:11.187
Yeah, and I kept them on a chain.

40:11.252 --> 40:12.659
And I wore them everywhere.

40:12.724 --> 40:14.015
I never let them out of my sight,

40:14.280 --> 40:15.428
Not even when I thought...

40:15.491 --> 40:17.459
That you and I could never be together again.

40:17.524 --> 40:19.371
But the thing is that,

40:19.372 --> 40:20.995
like I got out of the car the other day?

40:21.061 --> 40:23.923
You know, and I don't know, maybe the chain broke,

40:24.004 --> 40:25.503
Or, I...

40:25.667 --> 40:27.394
No, you were looking in the right place,

40:27.459 --> 40:31.939
You just were looking a couple days too late.

40:32.004 --> 40:34.579
Check your pocket.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.875
I found them on the floor of your car.

40:43.956 --> 40:46.051
I took this one to the jeweler.

40:46.116 --> 40:47.955
Why?

40:49.124 --> 40:52.883
I wanted to get it engraved.

40:52.964 --> 40:54.562
So that you would always remember,

40:54.627 --> 40:57.266
and that our child would know

40:57.331 --> 40:58.993
that what you and I have

40:59.058 --> 41:01.937
is...

41:05.570 --> 41:07.633
forever.

41:07.998 --> 41:10.508
If you'll have me.

41:18.979 --> 41:21.580
Melinda Gordon...

41:21.644 --> 41:24.987
Oh, will you marry me...again?

41:26.960 --> 41:28.846
Yes!

41:29.305 --> 41:35.797
