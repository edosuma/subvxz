<i> -CADE: It feels</i>

00:08.250 --> 00:09.583

00:09.735 --> 00:11.176
We share something that's...
It's hard to describe.

00:11.328 --> 00:12.494
I am not bargaining with you.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.404
Please, uh,
anything that you want,

00:14.423 --> 00:15.514
but you cannot tell Conrad.

00:15.665 --> 00:16.907
If you go to rehab,

00:17.076 --> 00:18.408
I won't tell anyone.

<i> PADMA:</i>
<i> No, this is hard,</i>

<i> do you understand?</i>

00:25.918 --> 00:27.342
What are they doing?
They're pulling the plug?

00:27.361 --> 00:29.511
You can save everyone
in this damn hospital,

00:29.530 --> 00:30.863
but you won't save her?

00:31.014 --> 00:32.256
Nic is gone.

00:32.349 --> 00:34.658
I'll never forgive you for this.

00:35.594 --> 00:37.661

spa reservation tomorrow.

01:02.471 --> 01:04.121
Well, I'm glad
you're getting away.

You deserve a break.

01:19.822 --> 01:20.637
Yes.

Oh, I'm sorry.
My van broke down in Savannah,

01:36.655 --> 01:38.913

into a shop until this morning.

01:39.082 --> 01:41.433
<i> Okay. Well,</i>
<i> I'm glad you're all right.</i>

01:41.585 --> 01:43.418
Well, they said it could

Can you grab me
some stuff for labs

02:22.459 --> 02:24.643

-I got it.

02:25.962 --> 02:27.371
HUNDLEY:
On my count.

02:27.464 --> 02:29.055
One, two, three.

02:29.966 --> 02:31.150
Chastain was
the nearest hospital,

02:31.301 --> 02:32.300
but he did not
want to come here.

02:32.394 --> 02:33.543
Yeah, yeah, and I still don't.

02:33.562 --> 02:35.379
Look, hey, hey.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

It sure has.

Get me out of here.

02:56.993 --> 02:58.177

Yeah, well, they can...
They can check me out,

♪ ♪

03:35.031 --> 03:38.217
God. Kyle Nevin.

03:38.293 --> 03:41.403
The last time I saw him
was the day Nic died.

03:41.405 --> 03:42.796
He didn't even
come to the funeral,

03:42.948 --> 03:44.056
he was so angry at me.

03:44.132 --> 03:47.059
He's still upset with you
five years later?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.210
Figured he'd get in touch

03:49.230 --> 03:51.730
if he wanted
to see his granddaughter.

03:53.959 --> 03:55.459
But he never did.

03:55.477 --> 03:57.236
How does he seem?

03:57.463 --> 03:58.528
Not well.

03:59.465 --> 04:01.481
He's not taking care of himself.

04:01.633 --> 04:03.558
I should have
tried harder to reconnect.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.393
BILLIE:
You tried.

04:06.638 --> 04:10.974
If he didn't even want to
see Gigi, that's on him.

04:11.067 --> 04:12.476
Blaming you for Nic's death,

04:12.494 --> 04:15.754
after we did everything
we could to try and save her?

04:15.905 --> 04:17.506
(pager beeping, buzzing)

04:20.410 --> 04:23.077
The scans just came back
on one of my patients.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.430
Are you good?

04:26.300 --> 04:28.016
Yeah.

04:29.419 --> 04:32.396
(sighs)

04:34.424 --> 04:36.683
Have you ever
passed out like this before?

04:36.835 --> 04:38.593
What? No. No, I was just
walking to my car. Maybe...

04:38.612 --> 04:41.521
I don't know, maybe I tripped
or something. I don't know.

04:41.673 --> 04:46.026
Do you have trouble
getting up stairs or hills?

04:46.194 --> 04:47.452
Look, I run out
of breath sometimes,

04:47.604 --> 04:48.862
but find me a guy
my age that doesn't.

04:49.014 --> 04:50.864
Is there anyone I can call
to bring you your things,

04:51.016 --> 04:52.457
-to make you more comfortable?
-No, no, no.

04:52.684 --> 04:54.293
I don't have
any friends here anymore.

04:54.369 --> 04:57.278
I just came to Georgia
to clear out a storage unit.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.356
-(Kyle sighs)
-Okay.

04:59.374 --> 05:01.300
Where are you living these days?

05:01.451 --> 05:02.876
Vermont.

05:03.028 --> 05:04.469
Is there a doctor
there that I can call

05:04.696 --> 05:06.029
to get your medical history?

05:06.048 --> 05:08.214
No, no. No, look, stop.
No, there are no doctors,

05:08.367 --> 05:10.867
there is no history.

05:10.886 --> 05:12.218
(sighs)

05:12.371 --> 05:14.387
None that I care
to remember anyway.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.149
Oh, this place looks
exactly the same.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.875
Oh, well, there've been
some changes around here.

05:18.894 --> 05:22.062
We even have a new preschool
and a kindergarten now...

05:22.214 --> 05:24.381
Wait, what? Preschool?
What kind of kid

05:24.399 --> 05:27.475
wants to go to preschool
at a hospital?

05:27.553 --> 05:29.644
There's one student there
you might know.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.145
Gigi?

05:31.165 --> 05:32.906
-Yup.
-Gigi?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.891
Yeah, she's in kindergarten,

05:35.060 --> 05:36.752
so we see her a lot around here.

05:38.230 --> 05:39.171
All right, so,

05:39.247 --> 05:40.655
I would like to admit you,

05:40.674 --> 05:42.916
get you on repeat labs
and an EKG.

05:43.068 --> 05:44.992
-Is that okay with you?
-Yeah, sure, whatever.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.262
Can I see Gigi first?

05:49.408 --> 05:50.574
DEVON:
Thanks for doing this.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.409
Once Kyle realized
that Gigi was here,

05:52.502 --> 05:55.503
he wouldn't talk about
anything else.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.688
Well, that's a surprise,

05:56.840 --> 05:59.024
but if it gives me a way
to get eyes on him...

05:59.175 --> 06:01.735
Why haven't I seen
Grandpa before?

06:02.863 --> 06:05.447
He lives far away.

06:07.109 --> 06:10.369
CONRAD:
Gigi, that's your
grandfather, Kyle.

06:10.520 --> 06:11.870
Kyle...

06:12.097 --> 06:14.355
you remember Georgiana Grace.

06:14.449 --> 06:15.932
Say hi, honey.

06:16.025 --> 06:18.126
Hi.

06:18.954 --> 06:20.027
Wow.

06:20.122 --> 06:22.105
You look
a lot like your mother did

06:22.124 --> 06:23.382
when she was about your age.

06:23.533 --> 06:25.867
CONRAD:
Everyone says
she looks like Nic.

06:25.961 --> 06:27.052
Yeah. (chuckles playfully)

06:27.279 --> 06:29.779
Hey, you want to come up here

06:29.873 --> 06:31.473
and you want to sit beside me?

06:34.453 --> 06:36.395
Yeah? Okay.

06:37.789 --> 06:39.456
Come on.

06:39.549 --> 06:41.307
(gasps)

06:41.460 --> 06:43.718
(chuckles) That's a girl.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.595
DEVON:
Are you okay, Kyle?

06:45.597 --> 06:47.239
Yeah, yeah,
I just got that capal thing.

06:47.466 --> 06:49.658
-Whatever...
-Carpal tunnel?

06:51.136 --> 06:53.303
Carpal tunnel, yeah, both hands,

06:53.396 --> 06:56.640
but... hardly the worst
of my worries right now.

06:56.733 --> 07:01.420
You look different from
the pictures Daddy showed me.

07:03.573 --> 07:05.715
More handsome, I hope?

07:08.244 --> 07:10.487
You showed her pictures?

07:10.505 --> 07:12.097
Of course.

07:12.248 --> 07:15.642
I wanted her
to know her grandfather.

07:19.665 --> 07:20.922
IAN:
There she is.

07:21.016 --> 07:22.924
(Ian chuckles)

07:23.018 --> 07:26.019
Thanks for making the drive.

07:26.188 --> 07:27.837
You look great, Dad.

07:27.931 --> 07:29.931
How are you feeling?

07:30.099 --> 07:32.099
Honestly, the last few weeks

07:32.194 --> 07:34.101
have been tougher
than I expected.

07:34.196 --> 07:35.287
Because of the detox?

07:35.514 --> 07:37.104
Crazy nausea, palpitations,

07:37.124 --> 07:39.124
panic attacks on steroids.

07:39.275 --> 07:40.850
That wasn't even the worst part.

07:40.944 --> 07:42.535
What was?

07:42.629 --> 07:44.278
Therapy.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.614
Our counselor Genevieve,
she takes no prisoners.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.801
She had me digging into stuff
I've avoided for a long time.

07:50.028 --> 07:51.027
About my father.

07:51.087 --> 07:53.046
Your mother.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.973
And you think that's helped?

07:55.124 --> 07:56.508
I know it has.

07:56.660 --> 07:59.202
But what kept me going?

07:59.337 --> 08:00.887
Knowing I'd see you today.

08:01.039 --> 08:02.539
GENEVIEVE:
All right,

08:02.557 --> 08:05.650
if everyone could please take
a seat, we'll get started.

08:10.232 --> 08:12.565
Look, I told you
everything Padma told me.

08:12.718 --> 08:14.384
She's in Savannah,
she'll be back tonight.

08:14.477 --> 08:17.162
I know what she said,
but how did she sound?

08:17.313 --> 08:18.238
Normal.

08:18.390 --> 08:19.781
Why isn't she
returning my calls?

08:19.891 --> 08:22.149
This is your sister
we're talking about, all right?

08:22.227 --> 08:24.669
Whose idea of fun
is llama yoga in the woods.

08:24.821 --> 08:26.730
AJ, I'm really getting
worried, okay?

08:26.748 --> 08:28.322
She really loves her babies.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.992
These last few months
have been rough on everybody,

08:31.011 --> 08:32.344
especially Padma.

08:32.513 --> 08:35.238
So if she needs
an extra day or two to unwind,

08:35.407 --> 08:37.331
-that's a win for everybody.
-(pager beeps)

08:37.500 --> 08:40.410
And plus, I've made sure
the boys are well taken care of.

08:40.503 --> 08:41.728
We're good.

08:42.764 --> 08:44.648
I got to go.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.255
(line ringing)

08:52.274 --> 08:54.682
<i> Hi, you've reached Padma.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>

08:54.701 --> 08:56.451
<i> (beeps)</i>

08:59.948 --> 09:02.282
This bright area is the tumor.

09:02.434 --> 09:06.770
After all these years,
it's... back?

09:07.864 --> 09:11.716
It's a good thing that you
and Lance brought her in today.

09:14.537 --> 09:17.514
Now that we know
what's going on...

09:18.559 --> 09:20.450
...we need to talk
about what's next.

09:20.468 --> 09:22.894
You mean surgery,
like last time?

09:23.121 --> 09:25.212
It's more complicated now.

09:25.274 --> 09:28.233
Your mom is older,
she's not quite as strong,

09:28.384 --> 09:31.644
and the tumor
is different, larger,

09:31.797 --> 09:34.647
and now in an area of the brain
that's more dangerous to access,

09:34.800 --> 09:38.243
with a very high risk
of bleeding if we operate.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.136
I don't recommend surgery.

09:40.229 --> 09:41.896
You don't want to save her?

09:41.990 --> 09:44.416
Of course I do.

09:46.328 --> 09:48.253
But based on the location
and size of the tumor,

09:48.422 --> 09:51.423
I believe that surgery
is more likely to do harm.

09:51.650 --> 09:54.926
You're saying
you can't fix this?

09:55.078 --> 09:57.337
Even if you make it through
the surgery, you could die,

09:57.431 --> 10:00.181
sooner rather than later,
because we operated.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.676
And a cure isn't possible
in my opinion.

10:03.829 --> 10:05.678
FRITZ:
You're not hearing us.

10:05.831 --> 10:09.090
We are not giving up on her,
and neither should you.

10:09.184 --> 10:11.484
I beat cancer once.

10:12.929 --> 10:14.571
I'll beat it again.

10:15.264 --> 10:17.449
I want the surgery.

10:18.434 --> 10:20.285
FRITZ:
And if you won't operate,

10:20.512 --> 10:23.997
well, we'll find
someone who will.

10:25.942 --> 10:28.368
We need a more
detailed patient history.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.462
Well, Kyle hasn't been
exactly forthcoming,

10:30.631 --> 10:32.021
but I will keep trying.

10:32.115 --> 10:34.132
I guess I'll go check on
patients who want my help today.

10:34.359 --> 10:36.134
We'll keep you posted.

10:36.285 --> 10:37.527
CONRAD:
Thank you.

10:37.545 --> 10:39.028
Hey, did you call for

10:39.047 --> 10:40.363
an interventional cardiologist?

10:40.456 --> 10:42.623
I did not.

10:42.643 --> 10:43.700
Hey.

10:43.718 --> 10:45.535
Oh, hey.

10:45.553 --> 10:48.462
Gentlemen, I saw
Mr. Nevin bradying down

10:48.556 --> 10:50.373
on the monitors
at the nurses' station,

10:50.392 --> 10:53.300
figured I'd check in and make
sure he's doing okay.

10:53.395 --> 10:55.228
New guy's got to be
proactive, right?

10:55.380 --> 10:59.065
Dr. Yamada thinks he knows
what might be going on.

10:59.217 --> 11:00.659
I'd like to start
with a stress test.

11:00.827 --> 11:04.220
And I'd like Dr. Austin
to examine my patient first.

11:04.239 --> 11:06.313
Thank you, Dr. Pravesh.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.908
Sure, but
you'll need to go fast.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.060
Transport is on the way.

11:11.079 --> 11:12.912
Wonderful.

11:13.064 --> 11:14.673
-KYLE: Thank you.
-You're welcome.

11:22.741 --> 11:24.132
CONRAD:
How's he doing?

11:24.926 --> 11:26.242
His stress test just started.

11:26.335 --> 11:28.335
Thanks for getting him set up,
Dr. Yamada.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.413
-I'll take it from here.
-I'd like to stick around

11:30.432 --> 11:32.023
-and help out.
-Well, I really appreciate that,

11:32.250 --> 11:34.341
but Kyle is basically family.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.420
So, I'm in a unique position
to offer clinical judgment

11:37.439 --> 11:40.031
without any personal
feelings in the way.

11:44.446 --> 11:45.853
Hey, we got it.

11:45.947 --> 11:47.872
(overlapping chatter)

11:48.024 --> 11:50.283
-DEVON: Got a chair for you.
-JAMES: We got a chair
right here.

11:50.435 --> 11:52.193
-(excited chatter)
-(Kyle panting)

11:52.287 --> 11:53.360
-JAMES: All right.
-DEVON: There you go.

11:53.455 --> 11:54.379
Oh, I'm good.

11:54.530 --> 11:57.340
I just got a little dizzy.
(panting)

11:58.626 --> 12:00.719
Let me see the printout.

12:00.795 --> 12:02.429
(Kyle panting)

12:03.798 --> 12:05.949
His heartrate didn't increase
during the stress test

12:06.042 --> 12:07.208
like we
would have expected it to.

12:07.302 --> 12:08.393
DEVON:
It was too low.

12:08.544 --> 12:11.438
That's why
he's been short of breath.

12:12.548 --> 12:15.233
If it gets any lower,
he could die.

12:15.384 --> 12:17.051
And if we don't intervene,

12:17.070 --> 12:19.479
that's exactly what will happen.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.322
(panting)

12:28.139 --> 12:29.155
But let's face it,

12:29.307 --> 12:30.415
at the end of the day,

12:30.566 --> 12:31.565
addiction isn't
one person's disease.

12:31.659 --> 12:32.492
It's the entire family's.

12:32.660 --> 12:34.327
Maybe you feel guilt

12:34.479 --> 12:36.087
because you didn't
recognize it sooner,

12:36.239 --> 12:38.164
or you're angry
because you didn't get

12:38.316 --> 12:39.740
the love and care
you longed for.

12:39.760 --> 12:43.410
So later today, your
loved ones will get a chance

12:43.430 --> 12:45.579
to hear what
you've been through.

12:45.673 --> 12:49.008
Everyone must talk honestly,

12:49.160 --> 12:50.584
maybe for the first time,

12:50.604 --> 12:53.730
for true recovery to begin.

12:59.929 --> 13:03.031
(wheezing)

13:04.225 --> 13:06.009
Oh.

13:06.027 --> 13:08.119
Well, what a wonderful surprise

13:08.346 --> 13:09.846
to wake up to.

13:09.864 --> 13:14.275
Daddy told me to let you sleep.
He said you needed your rest.

13:15.111 --> 13:18.338
You tell him you were
quiet as a mouse.

13:19.448 --> 13:21.782
He said you fell. Are you hurt?

13:21.860 --> 13:23.760
Not really.

13:25.547 --> 13:27.713
Just my pride.

13:27.866 --> 13:31.559
Daddy can fix that, too.
He can make anything better.

13:33.872 --> 13:35.688
Except your mom.

13:36.632 --> 13:38.483
He couldn't save her.

13:38.710 --> 13:40.209
He tried.

13:40.211 --> 13:43.029
He misses her so much.

13:49.812 --> 13:52.813
I think it's time we consider
possible next steps.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.240
I only see one.
We need to get Mr. Nevin

13:54.334 --> 13:56.317
to the cath lab right away.

13:56.411 --> 13:58.485
AUSTIN:
Because you think
his episodes of bradycardia

13:58.580 --> 14:01.747
are caused by
a lesion you can stent?

14:01.900 --> 14:03.599
-Seems likely to me.
-AUSTIN: Hmm.

14:03.601 --> 14:05.176
DEVON:
It's possible.
His stress test didn't show

14:05.328 --> 14:06.678
-signs of ischemia.
-No slam dunk signs of it,

14:06.829 --> 14:08.421
but there were
nonspecific changes.

14:08.573 --> 14:09.848
AUSTIN:
All right, let's back up here.

14:09.999 --> 14:12.575
There is no clear evidence
of coronary artery disease.

14:12.594 --> 14:15.336
AJ's right.
Kyle only failed the test

14:15.355 --> 14:17.246
because he couldn't
increase his heartrate.

14:17.265 --> 14:19.173
Which could be due
to a blockage.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.025
Or maybe he just
needs a pacemaker.

14:21.252 --> 14:22.602
Okay, and
what would you recommend?

14:22.696 --> 14:25.938
I want to monitor him,
get an electrophysiology study,

14:26.032 --> 14:28.515
and probably go ahead
and put in a pacemaker.

14:28.610 --> 14:31.594
And while we're waiting, he may
very well have a heart attack.

14:32.430 --> 14:34.614
All right, why don't
we start with the cath?

14:34.766 --> 14:37.433
If there's blockage,
maybe we find the source.

14:37.452 --> 14:39.102
In the meantime, I don't think
a stent or a pacemaker's

14:39.195 --> 14:40.620
the full answer,
so we keep searching,

14:40.714 --> 14:43.030
not just for something
that explains his arrhythmia,

14:43.199 --> 14:44.865
but the rest of his issues, too.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.551
Sounds like a plan.

14:46.628 --> 14:48.052
Cool.

14:52.508 --> 14:54.133
If I really thought
Doris had a shot,

14:54.285 --> 14:55.727
of course I'd take it.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.896
That's all tumor.

14:58.047 --> 15:01.599
It is, and entangled
in the vasculature.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.127
At worst, she never
makes it out of the OR,

15:04.129 --> 15:05.552
and at best, surgery buys her,

15:05.572 --> 15:06.796
what, a few months?

15:06.889 --> 15:09.240
Likely with permanent
neurological deficits.

15:10.485 --> 15:13.469
A doctor has the right
to refuse to operate.

15:13.488 --> 15:15.079
But her sons said
that if I don't,

15:15.231 --> 15:16.956
they'll find a surgeon who will.

15:21.479 --> 15:23.504
They're not gonna
find anyone as good as you.

15:24.666 --> 15:26.332
Look, it's your decision,

15:26.484 --> 15:29.168
but... if there's even
the slightest chance

15:29.320 --> 15:30.577
she could end up better off,

15:30.672 --> 15:34.390
you're the best person
to give her a decent outcome.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.068
I'm sorry, you guys
can't go any further.

15:48.597 --> 15:52.283
Hey, you got this, Mom.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.079
We love you.

15:57.532 --> 15:59.332
You'll be okay.

16:11.696 --> 16:14.697
(door opens, closes)

16:14.866 --> 16:18.217
AUSTIN:
So, Dr. Yamada found a lesion
in the right coronary artery.

16:18.369 --> 16:21.370
He's stenting it now.

16:21.389 --> 16:23.539
If Kyle's bradycardia persists,

16:23.708 --> 16:25.057
he's definitely
gonna need a pacemaker.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.226
Something else is going on here.

16:28.229 --> 16:30.637
CONRAD:
Nic would want me to help him.

16:30.732 --> 16:33.883
I mean, I'm just gonna say,
I'm surprised you are not angry.

16:33.901 --> 16:35.234
I mean, the man walked away

16:35.386 --> 16:36.828
from you
and his only grandchild.

16:36.979 --> 16:38.812
I forgave him a long time ago.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.741
The day Nic died, he lost
the only child he had left.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.393
The need
to blame someone's natural.

16:44.412 --> 16:46.062
Well, seems to me,
once we patch him up,

16:46.155 --> 16:47.913
he's going to be on his way,

16:48.066 --> 16:49.656
and probably not coming back.

16:49.676 --> 16:53.469
Yeah, so whatever is wrong
with him, we better fix it now.

16:55.164 --> 16:58.391
(door opens and closes)

17:00.687 --> 17:02.595
This tumor is even more vascular

17:02.747 --> 17:04.004
than it appeared on the scans.

17:04.024 --> 17:05.931
(alert beeping)

17:06.084 --> 17:07.416
Pressures are dropping fast.

17:07.510 --> 17:09.769
BILLIE:
It's eroding into
the surrounding vessels.

17:09.921 --> 17:11.087
She's bleeding out.

17:11.105 --> 17:12.679
Increase suction.

17:12.774 --> 17:13.990
Add a pressor.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.350
We're maxed out.

17:16.444 --> 17:18.110
Then activate massive
transfusion protocol.

17:18.263 --> 17:19.520
We need to buy some time.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.687
LEELA:
Don't give up.

17:20.782 --> 17:22.265
Hang in there.

17:22.433 --> 17:23.666
Forceps.

17:25.270 --> 17:27.086
I knew this was a bad idea.

17:37.799 --> 17:38.890
You're Ian's daughter, right?

17:39.117 --> 17:40.391
Uh, yeah, I am.

17:40.543 --> 17:41.559
Jan Price.

17:41.786 --> 17:44.120
Fellow inmate.
That's what we call ourselves

17:44.122 --> 17:45.304
-since we can't leave.
-Ah.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.140
Ian told me you're
not only an ER doctor,

17:48.234 --> 17:49.400
but an ICU doc, too?

17:49.627 --> 17:51.903
Yeah, I couldn't choose,
so I chose both.

17:51.979 --> 17:53.404
Well, that's impressive.

17:53.631 --> 17:56.491
No wonder he doesn't
stop talking about you.

17:58.561 --> 17:59.985
Especially the way
that you took care of him

18:00.138 --> 18:00.970
when he was
diagnosed with cancer.

18:01.063 --> 18:03.372
That meant a lot to him.

18:05.067 --> 18:07.085
That's nice to hear.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.755
Sorry. Did he tell you
to say all this?

18:10.948 --> 18:12.481
No, not at all.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.333
I just wish I were
more like your dad.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.410
He's been
a cheerleader for us all,

18:16.429 --> 18:19.913
and an inspiration
for many of us here.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.390
Nice meeting you.

18:24.512 --> 18:27.355
(indistinct chatter)

18:30.777 --> 18:32.501
The tumor was
deep inside the brain,

18:32.520 --> 18:34.170
entangled among
several key blood vessels.

18:34.188 --> 18:35.504
And you got it out?

18:35.523 --> 18:38.174
Yes, but there was
a lot of bleeding, and...

18:38.192 --> 18:40.934
Now our mom's gonna be okay?

18:41.028 --> 18:43.246
I never said that.

18:44.365 --> 18:45.939
I was honest about
the risks involved,

18:46.033 --> 18:48.517
and the fact that
a total cure isn't possible.

18:49.354 --> 18:50.628
The surgery went
as well as it could,

18:50.779 --> 18:53.022
but we won't know for sure
how Doris tolerated it

18:53.115 --> 18:54.206
until she wakes up.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.150
And even then,
her recovery will be long

18:56.152 --> 18:58.544
with the possibility
of many post-op complications.

18:58.713 --> 19:01.639
You said that she wouldn't
make it out of surgery...

19:02.809 --> 19:04.475
...but she did.

19:07.872 --> 19:10.022
We know our mom.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.526
She's gonna beat this.

19:20.735 --> 19:23.494
Padma's gonna call you back
as soon as she can.

19:23.721 --> 19:25.571
No, something's not right.

19:25.723 --> 19:28.708
"Twintuition" is real,
and in the past,

19:28.817 --> 19:30.393
no matter
how far away she's gone,

19:30.395 --> 19:34.079
I could always sense
if she was sick or hurting

19:34.232 --> 19:35.581
or in trouble.

19:35.750 --> 19:38.492
But Padma has gone radio silent
like this before, right?

19:38.586 --> 19:41.345
I remember that one time
she left in her van for a month

19:41.497 --> 19:43.088
without taking her cell phone.

19:43.165 --> 19:44.348
She was connecting with nature.

19:44.500 --> 19:47.059
That was long before
she had babies.

19:47.929 --> 19:50.262
Okay, here's what we know:

19:50.356 --> 19:52.581
She told AJ that she was
gonna be back tonight,

19:52.600 --> 19:55.418
and tonight is still
a couple hours away.

19:55.436 --> 19:57.678
And you...

19:57.697 --> 20:01.490
sometimes get overly anxious
when it comes to your sister.

20:06.764 --> 20:08.597
Maybe, just for today,
give her some space.

20:08.616 --> 20:12.543
She's not answering texts
because she doesn't want to.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.546
Okay.

20:16.290 --> 20:18.382
All right, I'll see you.

20:30.045 --> 20:31.687
(Kyle sighs)

20:33.566 --> 20:36.959
(chuckles)
You have a new doctor, I see.

20:37.052 --> 20:39.570
Uh, nurse, thank you very much.

20:39.722 --> 20:43.148
Daddy said I could spend
recess with Grandpa Kyle.

20:43.301 --> 20:44.483
Oh.

20:44.635 --> 20:47.970
Your heart is good.
Do you have any pain?

20:47.989 --> 20:50.306
(gasping) Yeah, yeah, I do.

20:50.399 --> 20:52.250
(stammers) My back hurts.

20:52.401 --> 20:54.067
-It's... It...
-Let me take a look.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.811
(gasping)

20:55.830 --> 20:58.071
(grunting in pain)

20:58.091 --> 21:00.549
(machine beeping)

21:01.410 --> 21:04.595
GIGI:
Grandpa! Grandpa!

21:04.764 --> 21:06.264
Come here, Gigi.

21:06.415 --> 21:08.173
Take Gigi.

21:08.326 --> 21:10.268
I need a code cart in here.

21:12.997 --> 21:15.014
(alert beeping)

21:15.166 --> 21:16.440
What happened?

21:16.667 --> 21:18.276
She had some runs of V tach,
but then went into V fib.

21:18.503 --> 21:20.761
Likely from
a cerebral catastrophe.

21:20.838 --> 21:23.188
LEELA:
I wish I could have
at least gotten her to CT.

21:23.341 --> 21:25.599
Her pupils
are fixed and dilated.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.452
I've already given her mannitol.
We've shocked her three times

21:28.604 --> 21:31.372
with no return of
spontaneous circulation.

21:32.274 --> 21:33.499
There's nothing more we can do.

21:36.129 --> 21:37.202
(alerts stop)

21:37.355 --> 21:40.189
(sighs)
Time of death 16:37.

21:40.282 --> 21:41.674
(pager beeps)

21:43.285 --> 21:45.285
This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.430
They should've listened to me.

21:48.549 --> 21:49.640
Where are her sons?

21:49.809 --> 21:51.976
I have to operate on
another critical patient.

21:52.127 --> 21:53.719
They went to the cafeteria.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.647
Well, I'll break the news
to them as soon as I'm out.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.066
Sure, we hope
this time is different,

22:07.160 --> 22:09.327
but honestly, I doubt it.

22:09.554 --> 22:12.663
Three times in treatment,
three times it failed.

22:15.409 --> 22:17.910
I don't know how long
we can keep trying to help

22:18.004 --> 22:19.486
before we walk away.

22:19.655 --> 22:22.064
AIMEE:
And we can't keep the truth
about your disease

22:22.083 --> 22:24.083
from Mom and Dad any longer.

22:24.159 --> 22:25.843
Yes, it'll hurt them,

22:25.994 --> 22:28.328
but how can you
accept responsibility

22:28.497 --> 22:31.682
for the pain you've caused
if we keep covering it up?

22:33.077 --> 22:34.243
GENEVIEVE:
Jan, can you see

22:34.261 --> 22:35.853
how your sisters lying for you

22:36.004 --> 22:37.855
is detrimental to them?

22:38.082 --> 22:40.432
And how that enables you?

22:40.585 --> 22:43.510
JAN:
I never asked anyone to lie.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.863
SUE:
Seriously? You asked me
to lie to your work

22:46.090 --> 22:48.181
when you blacked out
at the Hawks game.

22:48.201 --> 22:52.036
Not to mention
all the lies you've told me.

22:52.263 --> 22:54.763
I can't believe the last time
I actually believed a word

22:54.782 --> 22:57.766
coming out of your mouth.
I feel like you would lie to us

22:57.860 --> 23:00.269
about anything.

23:00.287 --> 23:02.296
♪ ♪

23:07.795 --> 23:09.445
Is Grandpa okay?

23:09.614 --> 23:12.114
Well, his heart slowed down
just for a little while,

23:12.207 --> 23:14.725
which is why he seemed
to fall asleep,

23:14.877 --> 23:16.877
but it started again.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.479
Is he gonna die?

23:19.381 --> 23:21.899
We're figuring out what's wrong.

23:22.126 --> 23:23.383
Now...

23:24.145 --> 23:26.237
...you should go back
to your classroom

23:26.388 --> 23:27.963
and let the doctors
do their work.

23:28.056 --> 23:29.798
(Hundley laughs)

23:29.892 --> 23:32.134
Come on, princess, let's get
you back to your schoolmates.

23:32.227 --> 23:34.495
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

23:37.642 --> 23:39.992
His heart rate stopped
for five seconds,

23:40.144 --> 23:41.919
then spontaneously restarted.

23:42.146 --> 23:44.146
If the blockage Dr. Yamada found

23:44.165 --> 23:45.164
was the sole cause
of his issues,

23:45.258 --> 23:46.482
this wouldn't have happened.

23:46.651 --> 23:48.484
He must have sick
sinus syndrome.

23:48.502 --> 23:50.277
Okay, so we agree
that he needs a pacemaker?

23:50.337 --> 23:53.172
Yes, we are all in agreement.

23:53.324 --> 23:54.990
Well, the question is
why he needs it.

23:55.009 --> 23:56.100
Hawkins, I trust your judgment.

23:56.269 --> 23:57.918
If there's another diagnosis

23:58.012 --> 23:59.662
to be found, you'll find it,

23:59.680 --> 24:01.346
but this man needs a pacer,
and he needs it yesterday.

24:01.499 --> 24:03.832
Yeah, let's get him
on the schedule.

24:03.926 --> 24:06.835
Hey, where's our mom?

24:06.854 --> 24:08.571
Did you move her?

24:11.617 --> 24:14.860
(sighs) There was
a post-op complication.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.121
Your mother's heart stopped,

24:17.272 --> 24:20.124
and we did everything we could

24:20.201 --> 24:22.460
to try to restart it, but...

24:24.021 --> 24:25.370
...she didn't make it.

24:25.465 --> 24:28.048
I'm so sorry.

24:30.194 --> 24:32.211
What the hell
are you talking about?

24:32.363 --> 24:35.139
You're saying she's dead?

24:35.249 --> 24:38.309
She was just here.
I just saw her.

24:38.536 --> 24:42.480
We need to talk
to Dr. Sutton. Now.

24:42.631 --> 24:44.315
She got pulled into
an emergency surgery,

24:44.466 --> 24:46.800
and she wanted to be
the one to tell you.

24:46.894 --> 24:48.486
I am so sorry.

24:48.637 --> 24:50.896
No, no, no, no. No!

24:50.990 --> 24:52.156
LEELA:
Please calm down.

24:52.383 --> 24:53.157
LANCE:
We don't even know

24:53.308 --> 24:54.158
who the hell you are.

24:54.309 --> 24:55.809
Dr. Sutton was the one

24:55.828 --> 24:56.827
who did the operation.

24:57.145 --> 24:59.980
We have grief counselors.
Let me call them.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.957
Haven't you done enough?!

25:09.233 --> 25:11.467
Sealing off the aneurysm.

25:12.995 --> 25:14.086
Is this where they kill people?!

25:14.238 --> 25:15.237
BILLIE:
You can't be in here.

25:15.256 --> 25:16.755
This is a sterile environment.

25:16.907 --> 25:18.407
-You killed our mother!
-JESSICA: Code Gray in OR Two.

25:18.500 --> 25:20.000
-Give me that!
-(alarm blaring)

25:20.019 --> 25:21.910
BILLIE:
Security is coming.

25:21.929 --> 25:23.979
Get out of my OR.

25:32.180 --> 25:34.573
(alarm continues blaring)

25:45.044 --> 25:46.602
Are you okay?

25:46.695 --> 25:48.771
Did security find them?

25:48.789 --> 25:50.956
No, they're still looking,
but they think they're gone.

25:51.108 --> 25:53.275
Billie, I am so sorry.

25:53.294 --> 25:55.611
The sons, they just...
They just walked in,

25:55.704 --> 25:56.779
and the mother wasn't there.

25:56.797 --> 25:57.796
I had to tell them.

25:57.948 --> 26:00.057
It's not your fault.

26:00.284 --> 26:02.518
They were wrong
to push for the surgery.

26:03.788 --> 26:06.397
Maybe they know it,
so they blame someone.

26:11.629 --> 26:15.406
Sometimes I don't know
how I keep doing this.

26:16.801 --> 26:19.451
Are you okay?

26:22.973 --> 26:25.574
I don't want to be okay.

26:27.144 --> 26:30.495
That would mean that I've lost
the ability to feel anything.

26:30.664 --> 26:32.464
(sighs)

26:34.110 --> 26:35.575
You should go home.

26:35.669 --> 26:37.052
I can't.

26:38.264 --> 26:41.515
I have another patient
I actually can help.

26:43.527 --> 26:46.061
I have to do it.
That's why I'm here.

26:47.255 --> 26:49.732
The work helps to steady me.

26:52.761 --> 26:54.028
I got this.

26:55.097 --> 26:57.430
(door opens and closes)

26:57.508 --> 26:59.508
(steady beeping)

26:59.526 --> 27:01.009
Ventricular lead.

27:01.028 --> 27:04.121
Thank you, Dr. Yamada.

27:05.199 --> 27:08.367
You know, you would make
an excellent assistant,

27:08.461 --> 27:10.336
Dr. Yamada.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.948
Well, be sure
to pin the guide wire

27:14.967 --> 27:16.541
to the drape, Dr. Austin.

27:16.694 --> 27:18.618
We don't want it ending up
in the pulmonary circulation.

27:18.696 --> 27:22.014
I hadn't planned on that,
Dr. Yamada.

27:23.550 --> 27:25.142
Do they both need
to be in there?

27:25.293 --> 27:27.478
There's a bit of a turf
battle going on.

27:27.705 --> 27:30.463
I'm worried about Kyle
after he leaves Chastain.

27:30.483 --> 27:33.133
Maybe his underlying
diagnosis is loneliness.

27:33.227 --> 27:34.393
DEVON:
That is more dangerous

27:34.487 --> 27:35.878
than some diseases.

27:36.046 --> 27:38.364
And harder to treat.

27:39.233 --> 27:41.474
Good, we have capture.

27:41.494 --> 27:42.809
JAMES:
Nice.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.144
(alert beeping)

27:44.163 --> 27:45.554
AUSTIN:
Pressure's in the 80s.

27:45.572 --> 27:46.738
Stop the V pacing.

27:46.891 --> 27:48.390
Now, let's get
the atrial lead in.

27:48.483 --> 27:49.892
We're gonna have to
start on the pressors.

27:49.985 --> 27:51.727
Hold on, hold on.

27:51.820 --> 27:53.395
(alert stops)

27:53.488 --> 27:54.505
(steady beeping)

27:54.656 --> 27:59.760
Well, look at that,
pressure's back up.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.755
His blood pressure tanked

28:03.908 --> 28:05.665
as soon as they paced
his ventricles.

28:05.685 --> 28:07.592
So when his ventricle was
the only chamber working,

28:07.745 --> 28:09.077
his pressure fell.

28:09.096 --> 28:11.671
Which could happen because
his ventricle is so thick.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.173
Which is generally the result of

28:13.192 --> 28:14.583
longstanding
high blood pressure.

28:14.601 --> 28:17.510
His isn't high.
Borderline low, even.

28:17.530 --> 28:20.013
Poor guy. Kyle has had
everything else go wrong.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.681
He said he had back pain.

28:21.850 --> 28:22.682
And carpal tunnel.

28:22.851 --> 28:25.351
Plus anemia,
renal dysfunction,

28:25.446 --> 28:26.929
bradycardia,
thickened ventricle.

28:26.947 --> 28:29.097
All of them
together means Kyle has...

28:29.116 --> 28:30.356
BOTH:
Amyloidosis.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.209
You were right, he has
a long-standing diagnosis

28:32.360 --> 28:34.044
that explains everything.

28:34.196 --> 28:35.528
It would've killed him.

28:35.548 --> 28:38.340
But now we can treat it.

28:43.797 --> 28:45.464
There's something very difficult

28:45.540 --> 28:49.727
that I...
I realize I have to admit.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.357
How much I've hurt you.

28:57.144 --> 29:01.964
The key characteristic
of my addiction,

29:01.982 --> 29:04.466
at least when I'm using,

29:04.559 --> 29:06.368
is narcissism.

29:07.988 --> 29:10.489
My work, my needs,

29:10.657 --> 29:12.307
they were all that mattered.

29:12.326 --> 29:14.159
It-It's a miracle
that you turned out to be

29:14.328 --> 29:17.504
the incredible person you are.
(laughs)

29:18.649 --> 29:22.742
So please, believe me
when I tell you

29:22.762 --> 29:24.762
that I am ready...

29:26.490 --> 29:28.390
...to do better.

29:29.994 --> 29:32.394
Would you like to respond?

29:33.272 --> 29:36.440
Charm is a deadly deceiver.

29:38.002 --> 29:40.185
And my father has charm.

29:40.262 --> 29:43.096
More than anyone I know.

29:43.173 --> 29:44.339
He uses it

29:44.358 --> 29:47.493
to win over people he needs.

29:49.013 --> 29:50.329
He's charmed all of you.

29:51.106 --> 29:54.182
But it's a magic trick,

29:54.201 --> 29:56.201
and you fell for the illusion.

29:56.353 --> 29:57.294
IAN:
Honey, I'm being open

29:57.521 --> 29:59.037
and honest,
admitting my flaws...

29:59.189 --> 30:01.423
Ian, you're supposed to listen.

30:02.543 --> 30:05.636
You know all
the right words to say,

30:05.787 --> 30:07.620
and you say them,

30:07.698 --> 30:09.364
but there is no way on earth

30:09.383 --> 30:11.975
to know if you
actually mean them.

30:12.127 --> 30:14.460
I will show you. (stammers)

30:14.555 --> 30:16.814
I will walk the walk.
You just have to believe in me.

30:16.965 --> 30:19.891
Oh, so your sobriety is
dependent on my belief in you.

30:20.044 --> 30:21.226
That line... (chuckles)

30:21.378 --> 30:23.970
That line is such a crock,

30:24.064 --> 30:26.698
and I'm done with it.

30:27.734 --> 30:28.992
I've believed,

30:29.144 --> 30:32.412
I've hoped a hundred times.

30:33.740 --> 30:38.460
And what's worse
is I've enabled.

30:39.229 --> 30:40.729
I lied to my school

30:40.747 --> 30:43.173
when you didn't show up
for parent-teacher conferences,

30:43.400 --> 30:46.418
I-I told the court
you were an exemplary parent

30:46.512 --> 30:49.571
because I was
afraid to lose you.

30:49.573 --> 30:53.258
And throughout it all,
your workplace never knew.

30:54.261 --> 30:57.020
No matter where you were,
I protected you.

30:57.189 --> 31:01.174
Even now,
I'm-I'm lying to your boss,

31:01.193 --> 31:03.986
I'm lying to my own boyfriend.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.606
I...

31:07.700 --> 31:10.092
I think I should really go

31:10.185 --> 31:13.704
because all I see here

31:13.931 --> 31:15.188
breaks me.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.875
Other families' lives
torn apart,

31:18.026 --> 31:20.043
other relatives'
lives destroyed,

31:20.270 --> 31:22.528
I see myself in all of them.

31:22.623 --> 31:25.290
We've all been dragged down
by this disease,

31:25.442 --> 31:29.553
and I... I can't go any lower.

31:29.704 --> 31:35.041
Ian, you can get sober or don't.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.477
But it's your problem.

31:44.478 --> 31:46.069
Cade, wait, please.

31:46.221 --> 31:47.738
I can't. I'm done.

31:47.965 --> 31:49.055
Don't-don't say that.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.298
You're right,
those were just words,

31:50.317 --> 31:52.300
but let me show you
with actions.

31:52.319 --> 31:53.744
They-they told me I was
going to need a goal

31:53.895 --> 31:57.472
if I was gonna have any kind of
sustained, real recovery,

31:57.491 --> 31:59.416
and something that I wanted
more than anything,

31:59.567 --> 32:01.234
that I could
only get in sobriety,

32:01.328 --> 32:03.662
and I thought that
that goal was going to be

32:03.814 --> 32:05.405
somehow to get my career back,

32:05.499 --> 32:07.090
but I realize now it's something
much more important than that.

32:07.242 --> 32:10.076
My goal is to make amends to you

32:10.095 --> 32:13.597
for all the harm
that I have done.

32:15.859 --> 32:16.508
Sweetheart, I...

32:16.602 --> 32:19.828
I never even thought about

32:19.846 --> 32:22.497
what my addiction did to you.

32:22.666 --> 32:25.091
I know.
To admit that, to say that,

32:25.110 --> 32:26.601
it's horrible.

32:27.688 --> 32:29.446
But if I can live
knowing that every day,

32:29.597 --> 32:33.116
I have a chance, a hope
to make that up to you?

32:34.787 --> 32:36.328
Cade...

32:37.531 --> 32:39.623
Give me a chance

32:39.850 --> 32:41.199
to prove to you

32:41.351 --> 32:43.585
and win back your love.

You're the only father I have,

for you anymore.

they just left.

Yeah, before security
could get to them.

33:18.905 --> 33:21.481
Well, we need to
make sure they're gone.

you and I are going to do
more good work together,

Conrad's wife Nic

I don't think
he ever got past that,

How are you feeling, Kyle?

38:34.371 --> 38:35.703
Better.

38:35.722 --> 38:36.813
That is because your son-in-law

38:36.964 --> 38:38.556
figured out that
you have amyloidosis,

38:38.708 --> 38:40.892

protein is accumulating

38:41.044 --> 38:42.635
