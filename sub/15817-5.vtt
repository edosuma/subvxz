00:02.403 --> 00:04.004
PREVIOUSLY ON LOVE & HIP-HOP:

00:04.004 --> 00:05.573
ATLANTA...

00:05.573 --> 00:08.076
I WANT TO PUMP THE BRAKES.

00:08.076 --> 00:08.809
PUMP MY BRAKES?

00:08.809 --> 00:09.477
WHAT THAT MEAN?

00:09.477 --> 00:10.178
I DON'T WANT TO START

00:10.178 --> 00:11.212
PLANNING NO WEDDING UNTIL

00:11.212 --> 00:11.979
I REALLY FEEL LIKE

00:11.979 --> 00:12.913
YOU GOT MY BACK.

00:12.913 --> 00:13.914
IF SHE SAID PUMP THE BRAKES,

00:13.914 --> 00:15.183
I'M PUMPING THEM ALL THE WAY.

00:15.183 --> 00:15.949
YOU FOLLOWING THE LEAD.

00:15.949 --> 00:16.684
I'M FOLLOWING THE LEAD.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.053
[moans]

00:19.053 --> 00:20.020
I LIKE R&B.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.622
I LIKE RAP--

00:21.622 --> 00:24.058
EMBODIED MUSIC.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.159
WHAT YOU GRABBING ON?

00:25.159 --> 00:25.826
I'M JUST--

00:25.826 --> 00:26.494
WATCH YOUR HANDS.

00:26.494 --> 00:27.661
WHAT YOU GRABBING ON?

00:27.661 --> 00:28.996
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH BENZINO?

00:28.996 --> 00:29.663
YOU KNOW HE TOLD ME

00:29.663 --> 00:30.531
HE [bleep] YOU.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.399
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

00:31.399 --> 00:32.233
WE DON'T KNOW IF SHE LYING

00:32.233 --> 00:32.900
RIGHT NOW.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.868
SHE MIGHT BE TELLING THE TRUTH.

00:34.868 --> 00:35.636
LET'S JUST GET TO THE BOTTOM

00:35.636 --> 00:36.404
OF IT.

00:36.404 --> 00:37.271
YOU GONNA CHECK THIS [bleep]

00:37.271 --> 00:37.938
OR WHAT?

00:37.938 --> 00:38.606
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:38.606 --> 00:39.273
WHAT YOU MEAN,

00:39.273 --> 00:39.940
WHAT I'M DOING?

00:39.940 --> 00:40.774
IF WE GOT HISTORY, THEN WHAT

00:40.774 --> 00:41.442
ARE YOU DOING, THEN?

00:41.442 --> 00:42.310
BYE, BITCH.

00:42.310 --> 00:43.577
SLEAZE, LEAVE.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.913
[bleep] THAT BITCH.

00:45.913 --> 00:46.914
I GOT TO DO BUSINESS

00:46.914 --> 00:47.748
WITH YOU, AND I GOT TO SEE

00:47.748 --> 00:48.449
THIS [bleep]?

00:48.449 --> 00:49.550
WHAT I DO ON MY OWN TIME

00:49.550 --> 00:50.918
IS WHAT I DO ON MY OWN TIME.

00:50.918 --> 00:51.752
WHAT I DO WITH MY MONEY

00:51.752 --> 00:53.421
IS WHAT I DO WITH MY MONEY.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.288
DO YOU THINK I WANT TO BE

00:54.288 --> 00:55.289
A BABY MAMA?

00:55.289 --> 00:56.557
I DIDN'T CHOOSE THIS [bleep].

00:56.557 --> 00:57.958
YOU CHOSE IT FOR ME, AND THEN

00:57.958 --> 00:59.327
HOW YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE AFFECTS

00:59.327 --> 01:01.395
ME--YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.

HAPPENED THE OTHER DAY, DREW

01:39.167 --> 01:40.701
ASKED ME TO LUNCH TO TALK, AND

01:40.701 --> 01:42.570
HE'S ABSOLUTELY THE LAST PERSON

01:42.570 --> 01:44.438
THAT I WANT TO TALK TO, BUT WE

01:44.438 --> 01:46.307
ARE A FAMILY, SO I DECIDED

01:46.307 --> 01:47.675
TO CALL A BABYSITTER AND GO TALK

01:47.675 --> 01:49.743
TO HIM AFTER ALL.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.045
DREW IS REALLY ONE OF THE ONLY

01:52.045 --> 01:53.747
PEOPLE THAT CAN DRAW THIS TYPE

01:53.747 --> 01:56.317
OF EMOTION OUT OF ME, BECAUSE

01:56.317 --> 01:58.986
I NEVER LOVED ANYONE AS MUCH

01:58.986 --> 02:01.455
AS I LOVED HIM, AND I HAVE

02:01.455 --> 02:04.024
NEVER GOTTEN MY HEART BROKEN

02:04.024 --> 02:06.794
AS MUCH AS HE BROKE MINE.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.796
WE WERE TOGETHER FOR FOUR YEARS,

02:08.796 --> 02:09.497
AND WE PLANNED ON GETTING

02:09.497 --> 02:10.198
MARRIED.

02:10.198 --> 02:10.931
WE TALKED ABOUT MARRIAGE.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.334
AND WHEN I GOT PREGNANT,

02:13.334 --> 02:14.202
SINCE I KNEW MARRIAGE

02:14.202 --> 02:16.204
WAS COMING, I WAS OKAY WITH

02:16.204 --> 02:19.607
HAVING THE CHILD, AND IT JUST

02:19.607 --> 02:21.809
WENT THE OTHER WAY.

02:21.809 --> 02:25.813
I STILL HAVEN'T MET ANYONE YET

02:25.813 --> 02:28.849
WHO I CAN LOVE.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.987
TRACI.

02:33.987 --> 02:34.988
SO WHAT'S UP?

02:34.988 --> 02:35.889
THE OTHER DAY,

02:35.889 --> 02:37.225
WHAT HAPPENED WASN'T COOL.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.392
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT IT

02:38.392 --> 02:39.860
AND EVERYTHING, BUT IN ORDER

02:39.860 --> 02:41.028
FOR THAT NOT TO HAPPEN AGAIN,

02:41.028 --> 02:42.730
WE NEED TO ESTABLISH SOME RULES,

02:42.730 --> 02:44.131
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST NOT COOL.

02:44.131 --> 02:46.634
I MEAN, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU

02:46.634 --> 02:49.102
FEEL IS BEST, THEN THAT'S FINE.

02:49.102 --> 02:51.939
I MEAN, I WANT TO GET AWAY FROM,

02:51.939 --> 02:53.441
YOU KNOW, RUNNING INTO SEEING,

02:53.441 --> 02:54.608
HEARING ABOUT ANYBODY

02:54.608 --> 02:55.543
THAT YOU DEALING WITH.

02:55.543 --> 02:56.244
I NEVER RUB NOTHING

02:56.244 --> 02:56.910
IN YOUR FACE.

02:56.910 --> 02:57.745
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.046
FIRST OF ALL, FROM THE

02:59.046 --> 03:00.080
BEGINNING, WHEN I WAS PREGNANT

03:00.080 --> 03:01.582
AND YOU CHEATED ON ME, WHICH YOU

03:01.582 --> 03:03.551
STILL HAVEN'T ADMITTED.

03:03.551 --> 03:04.618
WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION

03:04.618 --> 03:07.621
OF CHEATING?

03:07.621 --> 03:08.356
YOU WERE ENTERTAINING

03:08.356 --> 03:09.257
OTHER WOMEN.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.458
CORRECT.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.059
YOU WERE SEEING

03:12.059 --> 03:13.026
OTHER WOMEN...

03:13.026 --> 03:15.663
CORRECT.

03:15.663 --> 03:16.330
WHILE YOU HAVE

03:16.330 --> 03:17.064
A PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.165
THAT'S NOT--THAT'S--

03:18.165 --> 03:19.567
THAT SOUNDS OKAY TO YOU?

03:19.567 --> 03:20.268
I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.034
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU ASKED ME

03:21.034 --> 03:21.702
A QUESTION--

03:21.702 --> 03:22.503
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEVER

03:22.503 --> 03:23.504
SLEPT WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.438
RIGHT.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.873
NEVER.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.040
DREW, DON'T LET ME PUNCH YOU

03:27.040 --> 03:28.542
IN YOUR FACE, 'CAUSE YOU'RE--

03:28.542 --> 03:29.377
PLEASE DON'T LET ME REACH OVER

03:29.377 --> 03:30.711
THIS TABLE, JESUS.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.012
I'M SIX MONTHS PREGNANT.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.481
WOMEN ARE TEXTING ME.

03:33.481 --> 03:34.515
SOME CHICK OUT OF NEW YORK--

03:34.515 --> 03:35.983
"HE'S [bleep]."

03:35.983 --> 03:37.818
THE WOMEN CAME FROM THE LEFT

03:37.818 --> 03:38.486
TO THE RIGHT,

03:38.486 --> 03:39.853
AND IT DROVE ME CRAZY.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.054
NO WOMAN SHOULD EVER HAVE TO

03:41.054 --> 03:41.889
GO THROUGH WHAT I WENT THROUGH

03:41.889 --> 03:42.823
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.525
NONE.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.527
I AGREE.

03:49.029 --> 03:49.797
THAT'S WHY WE SHOULDN'T

03:49.797 --> 03:50.731
REVISIT THIS CONVERSATION,

03:50.731 --> 03:51.399
IS EVERY TIME--

03:51.399 --> 03:53.467
BUT I WANT YOU TO CHANGE.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.202
I WENT THROUGH A LOT,

03:55.202 --> 03:56.304
AND I DESERVE NOT TO SEE

03:56.304 --> 03:57.305
NO MORE WOMEN.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.205
I DESERVE NOT TO DEAL

03:58.205 --> 03:59.607
WITH NO MORE GROUPIES.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.342
I DESERVE MUCH MORE

04:01.342 --> 04:04.912
THAN WHAT I'M GETTING.

04:04.912 --> 04:05.646
YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T BEEN

04:05.646 --> 04:06.547
TOGETHER IN SEVEN YEARS, RIGHT?

04:06.547 --> 04:07.214
I KNOW THAT.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.316
OKAY, I'M JUST--

04:08.316 --> 04:09.049
YOU KNOW, I DON'T LIKE TO SEE

04:09.049 --> 04:11.051
TRACI CRY, BUT I'M A SINGLE MAN.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.520
I BEEN SINGLE FOR A WHILE.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.654
I NEED TO DO ME.

04:13.654 --> 04:14.888
IF I HAVE SOME WOMEN OVER

04:14.888 --> 04:16.390
AT MY HOUSE, I HAVE WOMEN OVER

04:16.390 --> 04:17.325
AT MY HOUSE.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.726
IT'S WHAT I DO.

04:18.726 --> 04:19.693
LET'S GET TO THE POINT.

04:19.693 --> 04:20.728
THE POINT IS, YOU BROUGHT ME

04:20.728 --> 04:22.095
HERE FOR A REASON, RIGHT?

04:22.095 --> 04:24.197
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

04:24.197 --> 04:25.866
I WANT YOUR MONEY.

04:25.866 --> 04:26.667
THAT CHECK--

04:26.667 --> 04:28.402
[laughs]

04:28.402 --> 04:29.470
YOU GONNA GET THAT CHECK--

04:29.470 --> 04:30.604
"GIVE ME THE MONEY."

04:30.604 --> 04:31.472
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

04:31.472 --> 04:32.440
THAT'S ALL IT'S ABOUT.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.841
WE TRYING TO MAKE THIS MONEY,

04:33.841 --> 04:35.242
TAKE CARE OF OUR FAMILY--

04:35.242 --> 04:36.444
THIS SNEAKER BOUTIQUE

04:36.444 --> 04:37.144
WILL DO THAT.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.112
YOU KNOW THAT.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.113
OKAY.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.382
LET ME JUST GO,

04:41.382 --> 04:42.249
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE STORE.

04:42.249 --> 04:43.417
WE'LL SOMEHOW TRY TO SEPARATE

04:43.417 --> 04:44.084
THIS BUSINESS

04:44.084 --> 04:44.985
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

04:44.985 --> 04:45.753
NEXT TIME I TALK TO YOU,

04:45.753 --> 04:46.454
WE'LL JUST TALK STRICTLY

04:46.454 --> 04:47.120
ABOUT THE STORE.

04:47.120 --> 04:47.821
MATTER OF FACT, I'LL COME

04:47.821 --> 04:49.189
TO THE STORE, WE'LL TALK ONLY

04:49.189 --> 04:51.091
BUSINESS AND NOTHING ELSE...

04:51.091 --> 04:51.759
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.394
AND WE'LL WORK THIS OUT.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.127
CAN I HAVE A HUG?

04:54.127 --> 04:56.129
NO. DON'T TOUCH ME.

I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR A WHILE.

AGO, AND I'M LOVING IT RIGHT

I LOVE THE SMILE.

05:42.242 --> 05:43.644
THAT'S YOUR BIGGEST ASSET.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.579
THANK YOU.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.448
I'M JUST, LIKE--

05:47.448 --> 05:48.115
I JUST WANT TO PUT THIS

05:48.115 --> 05:50.017
OUT THERE.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.421
I KNOW WE HAVE JUST--GETTING TO

05:53.421 --> 05:56.657
KNOW EACH OTHER ALL OVER AGAIN,

05:56.657 --> 05:58.959
AND IT'S GONNA TAKE A REAL

05:58.959 --> 06:03.263
STRONG, SECURE MAN TO DEAL

06:03.263 --> 06:05.032
WITH MY SITUATION, 'CAUSE--

06:05.032 --> 06:06.434
WHY DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU

06:06.434 --> 06:09.269
STILL ATTACHED TO A SITUATION

06:09.269 --> 06:10.671
THAT YOU CAN'T RUN FROM?

06:10.671 --> 06:11.972
I GOT SOME BAGGAGE.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.340
MOST PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY

06:13.340 --> 06:14.041
BE AFRAID.

06:14.041 --> 06:14.742
THEY'D BE, LIKE--

06:14.742 --> 06:15.776
EVERYBODY GOT BAGGAGE.

06:15.776 --> 06:16.577
I DON'T HAVE THE BAGGAGE THAT

06:16.577 --> 06:21.348
YOU HAVE, BUT DO I HAVE...

06:21.348 --> 06:22.015
A PAST?

06:22.015 --> 06:24.985
OF COURSE I HAVE A PAST,

06:24.985 --> 06:27.254
BUT MY PAST IS NOT HAUNTING ME.

06:27.254 --> 06:30.290
IS MY PAST STILL HAUNTING ME?

06:30.290 --> 06:32.192
YES AND NO.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.527
MY PAST WITH STEVIE IS JUST

06:33.527 --> 06:36.029
THAT--THE PAST--BUT ALSO,

06:36.029 --> 06:38.298
15 YEARS PLUS WITH STEVIE

06:38.298 --> 06:39.800
MAKES ME DOUBT ALL MEN

06:39.800 --> 06:41.001
AND THEIR SINCERITY.

06:41.001 --> 06:44.472
ONE: I HAVE A 3-YEAR-OLD.

06:44.472 --> 06:45.906
SHE'S NOT 15.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.275
SHE'S 3.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.877
RIGHT.

06:49.877 --> 06:53.614
TWO: YOU'RE IN THE SAME

06:53.614 --> 06:54.482
PROFESSION.

06:54.482 --> 06:55.549
YEAH, BUT THAT'S WHAT I DO.

06:55.549 --> 06:56.684
I'M NOT GONNA CHANGE WHAT I'M

06:56.684 --> 06:58.285
DOING BECAUSE PEOPLE

06:58.285 --> 06:59.319
ARE SAYING--

06:59.319 --> 07:00.320
YOU GOT TO MAKE THAT DECISION

07:00.320 --> 07:01.889
FOR YOURSELF, AND I KNOW,

07:01.889 --> 07:02.756
YOU KNOW, I'M--YOU KNOW,

07:02.756 --> 07:03.891
EVERYBODY MIGHT BE TELLING--

07:03.891 --> 07:05.493
"OH, ANOTHER PRODUCER,"

07:05.493 --> 07:07.227
BUT I'M NOT THAT DUDE.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.663
GUESS WHAT.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.364
I'M GOING WITH MY GUT

07:11.364 --> 07:14.668
AND MY INTUITION, SO...

07:14.668 --> 07:15.603
GOOD.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.505
SO WHAT YOUR GUT TELLS YOU?

07:17.505 --> 07:19.607
* I GOT A MAN

07:19.607 --> 07:21.141
THAT'S NOT A TRUE QUESTION.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.043
[laughs]

07:23.043 --> 07:25.946
* BUT I HAVE A FRIEND

07:25.946 --> 07:27.948
♪ WHO'S MY EVERYTHING ♪

07:30.350 --> 07:31.519
WHEN I TOLD SCRAPPY THAT

07:31.519 --> 07:32.986
I WANTED TO PUMP THE BRAKES

07:32.986 --> 07:34.855
ON THE PLANNING OF OUR WEDDING,

07:34.855 --> 07:35.723
I WAS JUST THINKING THIS WAS

07:35.723 --> 07:37.691
ANOTHER BUMP IN THE ROAD,

07:37.691 --> 07:41.529
AND I'M REALIZING IT'S NOT.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.763
SO THE OTHER NIGHT, I GO

07:42.763 --> 07:44.297
DOWNSTAIRS, GET ME SOMETHING

07:44.297 --> 07:45.265
TO DRINK--IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT

07:45.265 --> 07:46.667
12:00, 1:00 IN THE MORNING--

07:46.667 --> 07:48.769
AND SCRAPPY'S ASLEEP,

07:48.769 --> 07:50.303
AND HIS PHONE IS JUST VIBRATING.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.138
IT'S GOING OFF.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.973
EVERYTHING'S POPPING UP ON THE

07:52.973 --> 07:55.375
SCREEN, AND IT'S TEXT MESSAGES.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.343
YOU KNOW, "WHAT YOU DOING?"

07:56.343 --> 07:57.410
OR "WHERE YOU AT?"

07:57.410 --> 07:58.546
AND, YOU KNOW, "I MISS YOU.

07:58.546 --> 07:59.580
IT WAS GOOD SEEING YOU,"

07:59.580 --> 08:01.414
AND IT'S LIKE, SEEING YOU

08:01.414 --> 08:04.217
WHERE AND WHEN?

08:04.217 --> 08:05.919
IF IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE

08:05.919 --> 08:07.821
WITHOUT A HISTORY OF CHEATING,

08:07.821 --> 08:08.822
THEN MAYBE I COULD HAVE JUST

08:08.822 --> 08:11.559
BRUSHED IT OFF, BUT NOT SCRAPPY.

08:14.261 --> 08:14.995
YOU DON'T KNOW, BUT I WENT

08:14.995 --> 08:16.463
THROUGH YOUR PHONE, SEEN YOUR

08:16.463 --> 08:18.398
TEXTS AND TALKING TO FEMALES AND

08:18.398 --> 08:21.234
WHATNOT, AND THAT JUST REALLY

08:21.234 --> 08:23.136
BOTHERS ME, BECAUSE YOU YOURSELF

08:23.136 --> 08:24.137
TOLD ME THAT'S SOMETHING

08:24.137 --> 08:24.805
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO

08:24.805 --> 08:26.406
WORRY ABOUT, AND--

08:26.406 --> 08:27.340
THAT COULD BE JUST SOMETHING

08:27.340 --> 08:28.275
I DO, YOU FEEL ME?

08:28.275 --> 08:29.042
OR I DID.

08:29.042 --> 08:29.810
I COULD JUST BE TEXTING,

08:29.810 --> 08:30.644
YOU FEEL ME?

08:30.644 --> 08:31.478
SO IT MAKES IT OKAY?

08:31.478 --> 08:33.614
NO, BUT WHAT IT DOES IS,

08:33.614 --> 08:35.282
LIKE, ONCE YOU GO LOOKING FOR

08:35.282 --> 08:36.416
SOMETHING, YOU GONNA FIND IT,

08:36.416 --> 08:37.184
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

08:37.184 --> 08:37.951
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT LOOKING

08:37.951 --> 08:40.320
IN MY PHONE TO SEE NOTHING.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.454
YOU'RE LOOKING IN MY PHONE

08:41.454 --> 08:42.322
WITH THE MIND, "I'M GONNA

08:42.322 --> 08:43.657
SEE SOMETHING."

08:43.657 --> 08:45.025
SO YOU GO IN THERE WITH THAT

08:45.025 --> 08:47.595
MIND, YOU GONNA SEE WHAT?

08:47.595 --> 08:48.829
SOMETHING.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.632
I AIN'T, LIKE, A PEACHY CLEAN

08:51.632 --> 08:52.700
DUDE, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

08:52.700 --> 08:55.035
BUT I FEEL LIKE, EVEN BEFORE,

08:55.035 --> 08:56.136
YOU KNOW, YOU SEEN THEM TEXTS

08:56.136 --> 08:57.004
IN MY PHONE, YOU STILL HAD THE

08:57.004 --> 08:58.906
TRUST ISSUE, SO IT WAS, LIKE--

08:58.906 --> 08:59.607
IT'S NOT--

08:59.607 --> 09:01.108
NO, NO, NO, LET ME FINISH.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.810
EVEN WHEN SOMETHING ELSE HAPPEN,

09:02.810 --> 09:03.677
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING,

09:03.677 --> 09:05.312
THAT I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH,

09:05.312 --> 09:06.614
IT STILL FOLLOW ME.

09:06.614 --> 09:07.615
HOW CAN I TRUST YOU

09:07.615 --> 09:08.381
OR BUILD TRUST IN YOU IF--

09:08.381 --> 09:09.850
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

09:09.850 --> 09:10.784
WHEN I SEE WHAT I SEE IN YOUR

09:10.784 --> 09:11.719
PHONE, IT'S LIKE, IT TAKES--

09:11.719 --> 09:13.053
EVERYTHING THAT I BEGIN

09:13.053 --> 09:14.287
TO BUILD BACK IN YOU,

09:14.287 --> 09:15.923
IT TAKES ALL THAT AWAY FROM ME,

09:15.923 --> 09:17.190
SO IT'S LIKE STARTING ALL OVER

09:17.190 --> 09:17.958
AGAIN, AND IT'S LIKE, WELL,

09:17.958 --> 09:19.026
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO KEEP

09:19.026 --> 09:20.861
STARTING ALL OVER AGAIN?

09:20.861 --> 09:21.528
JUST LIKE AN EMOTIONAL

09:21.528 --> 09:23.631
ROLLER COASTER.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.766
I KNOW LOVE AIN'T THE EASIEST

09:25.766 --> 09:26.700
THING IN THE WORLD,

09:26.700 --> 09:27.400
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.101
IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE

09:28.101 --> 09:28.769
THE HARDEST.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.904
TYPICAL SCRAPPY.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.906
I'M TRYING TO DISCUSS A SPECIFIC

09:32.906 --> 09:34.975
ISSUE, AND YOU WANT TO TALK

09:34.975 --> 09:36.944
ABOUT THE MEANING OF LOVE.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.145
NOT THIS TIME.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.212
I DON'T FEEL LIKE FEEDING

09:39.212 --> 09:41.081
INTO YOUR BULL[bleep].

09:41.081 --> 09:41.749
BUT I DO LOVE YOU.

09:41.749 --> 09:42.816
TELLING YOU WHAT THE REAL IS.

09:42.816 --> 09:43.851
I DO LOVE YOU, BABE.

09:43.851 --> 09:44.652
MAYBE YOU NEED TO SEE

09:44.652 --> 09:45.352
THE OTHER ONE, 'CAUSE HAVE

09:45.352 --> 09:46.186
YOU NOTICED?

09:46.186 --> 09:46.920
YEAH, I NOTICED.

09:46.920 --> 09:47.655
YOU HAVE?

09:47.655 --> 09:48.488
YEAH.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.156
I'VE TAKEN IT OFF,

09:49.156 --> 09:50.290
AND I HAVEN'T PUT IT BACK ON.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.359
DO YOU WANT IT?

09:52.359 --> 09:53.426
THAT'S THE WHOLE QUESTION.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.295
DO YOU WANT THE RING?

09:55.295 --> 09:56.563
IF THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT, I'M

09:56.563 --> 09:57.698
COOL, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

09:57.698 --> 09:58.365
I'M REAL COOL.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.968
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS--

10:00.968 --> 10:01.802
IT'S JUST FALLING--

10:01.802 --> 10:02.970
WELL, IT HAS FELL APART,

10:02.970 --> 10:04.237
BASICALLY.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.272
LET ME JUST BE STRAIGHT UP.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.174
I THINK WE NEED A BREAK.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.076
UP UNTIL NOW, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN

10:09.076 --> 10:10.610
SCRAPPY SAYING HE'S DONE WITH

10:10.610 --> 10:12.713
THE RELATIONSHIP OR HE NEEDS

10:12.713 --> 10:15.582
A BREAK OR JUST MAKING UP SOME

10:15.582 --> 10:17.450
TYPE OF EXCUSE FOR THE WRONG

10:17.450 --> 10:18.952
THAT HE'S DONE, BUT THIS

10:18.952 --> 10:21.922
GO-AROUND, IT'S ME.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.590
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.025
ERICA IS DONE.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.760
THE MARRIAGE IS OFF.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.128
ENGAGEMENT: OFF.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.831
RELATIONSHIP: NULL AND VOID.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.710
YOU LOVE ME?

10:42.710 --> 10:43.443
DO FAT GIRLS LOVE

10:43.443 --> 10:45.112
CHOCOLATE CAKE?

10:45.112 --> 10:46.079
WHAT'S UP WITH ME AND YOU

10:46.079 --> 10:47.447
WATCHING THE TAPE OF JOSELINE?

10:47.447 --> 10:48.448
JOSELINE WAS TOUCHING

10:48.448 --> 10:49.482
HER [bleep].

10:49.482 --> 10:50.483
YOU SHOWED IT TO ME!

10:50.483 --> 10:52.352
NO, I DIDN'T.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.987
WHY YOU TALKING ABOUT ME

10:53.987 --> 10:55.055
WITH YOUR MAN?

10:55.055 --> 10:56.189
WHY IS MY MAN TALKING

10:56.189 --> 10:57.390
ABOUT ME TO YOU?

10:57.390 --> 10:58.058
THAT'S WHY.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.060
BITCH, GO SUCK SOME ASS[bleep].

11:11.872 --> 11:13.073
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

11:13.073 --> 11:14.541
WHAT IS THIS?

11:14.541 --> 11:15.542
RIGHT.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.310
SHE'S GETTING HER NAILS DONE,

11:17.310 --> 11:19.780
AND I'M GETTING MY WHOO-HAH

11:19.780 --> 11:20.914
BEDAZZLED.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.315
[laughs]

11:22.315 --> 11:23.316
I'M HOPING THAT ALL

11:23.316 --> 11:24.551
THE FLASHING LIGHTS DOWN THERE

11:24.551 --> 11:26.086
AND STUFF MIGHT PERK UP A LITTLE

11:26.086 --> 11:28.521
BIT AND, YOU KNOW, INSPIRE SOME

11:28.521 --> 11:30.758
KIND OF FUNCTION OR SOMETHING,

11:30.758 --> 11:32.025
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW, I'M IN FULL

11:32.025 --> 11:33.894
WORK MODE, AND THAT'S ALL I SEE,

11:33.894 --> 11:34.995
AND I NEED HER TO WAKE UP.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.496
I WANT TO HAVE SOME FUN.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.865
IT DON'T EVEN LIKE PEOPLE.

11:37.865 --> 11:38.565
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.933
GIRL, I KNOW WHAT'S WRONG

11:39.933 --> 11:40.768
WITH HER.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.235
SHE'S STUCK ON THIS ONE MAN,

11:42.235 --> 11:42.903
AND THAT'S HER LITTLE

11:42.903 --> 11:44.838
KITTY CAT'S PROBLEM AS WELL.

11:44.838 --> 11:48.075
AW, THAT IS A PROBLEM.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.843
THIS ONE WOULD BE CUTE.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.344
LIPS.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.914
RED LIPS.

11:53.914 --> 11:54.581
NO.

11:54.581 --> 11:55.248
OKAY.

11:55.248 --> 11:55.916
NO.

11:55.916 --> 11:56.583
[laughter]

11:56.583 --> 11:58.085
WHAT?

11:58.085 --> 11:59.086
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.320
DOLPHIN. WATER.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.321
THAT'S WHAT I NEED.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.622
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED?

12:02.622 --> 12:03.290
THE DOLPHIN.

12:03.290 --> 12:03.957
YES.

12:03.957 --> 12:04.792
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET A NICE

12:04.792 --> 12:05.893
BOTTLE OF LUBE?

12:05.893 --> 12:06.960
I REFUSE TO TAKE IT

12:06.960 --> 12:07.928
TO THE LUBE.

12:07.928 --> 12:08.595
WHY?

12:08.595 --> 12:09.429
I REFUSE TO TAKE IT TO THERE.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.097
WHY? IT'LL--

12:10.097 --> 12:12.465
THAT'S LIKE A MAN GOING

12:12.465 --> 12:15.368
AND USING A SAUSAGE PUMPER.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.036
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:16.036 --> 12:16.837
I DON'T LIKE THAT,

12:16.837 --> 12:17.905
BUT I LIKE CREATIVE STUFF.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.907
LIKE, I LIKE, LIKE, POURING SALT

12:19.907 --> 12:20.573
AROUND THE BED.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.241
THIS IS WHAT I DO.

12:21.241 --> 12:21.909
WHAT?

12:21.909 --> 12:23.710
ARE YOU A [bleep]--WHAT?

12:23.710 --> 12:24.812
LISTEN, YOU GOT TO LET ME

12:24.812 --> 12:26.113
BE ME.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.280
WAIT, LET HER TELL THE STORY,

12:27.280 --> 12:28.115
'CAUSE I WANT TO HEAR THIS.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.117
WHAT?

12:32.719 --> 12:33.520
SO...

12:33.520 --> 12:35.455
YOU ARE A--I CAN'T.

12:35.455 --> 12:36.389
WHAT THE [bleep]?

12:36.389 --> 12:37.724
YOU KEEPING THAT MAN AWAY.

12:37.724 --> 12:38.391
THAT'S--THAT'S--

12:38.391 --> 12:39.827
YOU KEEPING YOUR DUDE AWAY

12:39.827 --> 12:41.228
WITH YOUR SALT.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.130
PROBABLY LOOKING AROUND.

12:43.130 --> 12:43.931
HE'S LIKE, "WHAT THE [bleep]

12:43.931 --> 12:45.833
WRONG WITH THIS CRAZY BITCH?"

12:45.833 --> 12:46.666
RIGHT BEFORE IT'S ABOUT TO GO

12:46.666 --> 12:48.836
DOWN, YOU MAKE SURE YOU GOT YOU

12:48.836 --> 12:51.471
SOME SALTS, AND YOU GO AROUND

12:51.471 --> 12:55.675
THE BED WITH THE SALT.

12:55.675 --> 12:56.543
AROUND THE BED.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.710
NOT ON THE PERSON.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.012
AND THAT IS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT

12:59.012 --> 13:00.848
YOU GUYS IN THE BED

13:00.848 --> 13:03.116
AND KEEP THE SEX DEMONS OUT.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.451
AND YOU CLEAN YOUR HOUSE WITH

13:04.451 --> 13:07.754
AMMONIA BEFORE THE SUN COME UP.

13:07.754 --> 13:08.856
[laughs]

13:08.856 --> 13:11.591
I'M SORRY.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.459
WHO TOLD YOU THIS?

13:12.459 --> 13:13.226
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, THIS IS

13:13.226 --> 13:15.095
BEFORE THE MAN GETS UP?

13:15.095 --> 13:16.729
BEFORE SUNRISE.

13:16.729 --> 13:17.530
THAT MAKES HIM STAY WITH YOU.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.431
OH, MY GOD.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.099
REALLY?

13:19.099 --> 13:20.000
YEAH.

13:20.000 --> 13:20.868
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A ROOT

19:32.639 --> 19:34.574
LISTENING TO CHE' MACK'S DEMOS,

19:34.574 --> 19:35.808
I WAS ALMOST READY TO START

19:35.808 --> 19:36.576
WORKING WITH HER,

19:36.576 --> 19:38.545
BUT THEN SHE DISAPPEARED.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.780
AND LOOK WHAT THE WIND BLEW IN.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.315
HI, STEVIE.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.617
FROM HER LAST WEEK, I'M LIKE,

GIRLFRIEND, JOSELINE, AND YOU

20:08.140 --> 20:10.977
USED ME TO GET BACK, AND THEN--

20:20.787 --> 20:22.522

20:22.522 --> 20:23.556
LET'S START A WHOLE--

20:23.556 --> 20:25.124
ALL RIGHT, I GOT A IDEA.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.726
'CAUSE YOUR LANE IS NOT

20:26.726 --> 20:27.460
THE LANE THAT I'M TRYING

20:27.460 --> 20:28.595
TO BE A PART OF.

20:28.595 --> 20:32.865
WE NEED TO MAKE SOME REAL SONGS.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.934
WHAT ARE REAL SONGS?

20:34.934 --> 20:35.602
YEAH.

20:35.602 --> 20:36.603
EVERYDAY LIFE, LIKE HOW IT

20:36.603 --> 20:37.604
USED TO BE BACK IN THE DAY.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.638
OKAY.

20:38.638 --> 20:39.506
THE STRUGGLE.

20:39.506 --> 20:40.172
THE STRUGGLE?

20:40.172 --> 20:40.907
YEAH.

20:40.907 --> 20:41.674
BUT EVERYBODY DON'T LIVE

20:41.674 --> 20:42.342
IN A STRUGGLE.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.009
PEOPLE WANT TO DANCE

20:43.009 --> 20:43.843
AND HAVE FUN TOO.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.812
BUT I WANT THAT SOUND.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.146
I DON'T WANT THE DING-DING,

20:47.146 --> 20:48.615
THE PING-PING, THE CHING-CHING.

20:48.615 --> 20:49.582
I DON'T WANT WHAT EVERYBODY

20:49.582 --> 20:51.117
IS USED TO FOR RIGHT NOW.

20:51.117 --> 20:52.985
I WANT THAT BACK-IN-THE-DAY.

20:52.985 --> 20:53.653
I DON'T CARE ABOUT--

20:53.653 --> 20:55.588
IT'S CALLED CLASSIC RECORDS.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.255
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.056
YEAH?

20:57.056 --> 21:00.460
SO WHERE IS IT?

21:00.460 --> 21:01.794
YO, YO, YO, HOLD UP, SHORTY.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.363
RELAX A LITTLE BIT.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.163
YOU KNOW, I BEEN WALKING THIS

21:04.163 --> 21:06.032
ROAD FOR 18 JOINTS, YOU KNOW?

21:06.032 --> 21:07.867
YOU GOT ONE SONG OUT?

21:07.867 --> 21:09.101
IF ANYBODY KNOW HOW TO RUN THIS

21:09.101 --> 21:11.338
SHOW, THAT'S ME, THE GOOD GUY.

21:11.338 --> 21:12.705
TONE IT ON DOWN.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.040
OH, MY GOODNESS.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.041
TONE IT ON DOWN AND GET

21:15.041 --> 21:16.008
TO UNDERSTAND THIS:

21:16.008 --> 21:17.209
I MAKE HITS IN MY SLEEP,

21:17.209 --> 21:18.645
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

21:18.645 --> 21:19.346
I LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE,

21:19.346 --> 21:20.046
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

21:20.046 --> 21:20.880
BUT YOU NEED TO CHANNEL THAT

21:20.880 --> 21:22.214
TO WHERE IT NEED TO BE.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.050
GET YOUR MIND RIGHT.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.652
GET YOUR BODY ALL THE WAY RIGHT.

21:25.652 --> 21:26.986
MY BODY IS ALL THE WAY RIGHT.

21:26.986 --> 21:27.820
WHAT YOU MEAN?

21:27.820 --> 21:29.356
YOU ABOUT 80--LET ME SEE.

21:29.356 --> 21:29.989
WHAT YOU MEAN?

21:29.989 --> 21:30.790
YOU ABOUT 80%.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.024
ALL RIGHT, WELL, OKAY.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.460
BUT THIS IS REAL.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.027
LET ME SEE.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.563
MY ASS IS REAL.

21:36.563 --> 21:39.131
IT DON'T DO NOTHING BUT SHAKE.

21:39.131 --> 21:39.799
YOU NEED TO GET BACK

21:39.799 --> 21:40.767
TO THE REAL.

21:40.767 --> 21:41.901
IT'S REAL PEOPLE OUT HERE.

21:41.901 --> 21:42.669
YOU'RE DISTRACTING ME.

21:42.669 --> 21:43.670
YEAH, I'M DISTRACTING.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.371
BUSINESS.

21:44.371 --> 21:45.104
WE HANDLING BUSINESS.

21:45.104 --> 21:45.772
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.206
I'M TELLING YOU, YOUR MOUTH,

21:47.206 --> 21:48.240
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING,

21:48.240 --> 21:49.642
IT'S GONNA GET YOU IN TROUBLE.

21:49.642 --> 21:50.610
LOOK, WE'LL HAVE A SIGN.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.278
WE'LL HAVE A--WHEN I'M TALKING

21:52.278 --> 21:53.613
TOO MUCH AND YOU KNOW I'M FEISTY

21:53.613 --> 21:55.782
AND ALL THAT, JUST GIVE ME THE--

21:55.782 --> 21:56.816
YOU GONNA KNOW HOW MY EYES

21:56.816 --> 21:57.984
LOOK WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOU.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.085
WHAT?

21:59.085 --> 22:01.087
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.996
[dog barking]

22:09.996 --> 22:11.230
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN

22:11.230 --> 22:12.131
GOING ON WITH MY BROTHER

22:12.131 --> 22:13.232
AND KIDS, I FEEL LIKE,

22:13.232 --> 22:14.300
FINANCIALLY, MY BACK IS JUST

22:14.300 --> 22:16.669
UP AGAINST THE WALL.

22:16.669 --> 22:17.970
I KNOW THAT ZINO SAID MESSING

22:17.970 --> 22:19.906
WITH KARLIE IS A BAD IDEA, BUT

22:19.906 --> 22:21.408
I GOT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING.

22:21.408 --> 22:22.542
I'M NOT TELLING YOU DO SOMETHING

22:22.542 --> 22:24.010
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO, BUT JUST

22:24.010 --> 22:25.812
CONSIDER IT, BECAUSE--

22:25.812 --> 22:26.479
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

22:26.479 --> 22:27.714
LET ME SAY THIS.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.281
I'M NOT CONSIDERING NOTHING,

22:29.281 --> 22:30.550
BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M ABOUT

22:30.550 --> 22:31.518
BUSINESS, AND YOU

22:31.518 --> 22:32.251
ABOUT BUSINESS.

22:32.251 --> 22:33.453
JUMPING ON THE KARLIE RECORD--

22:33.453 --> 22:34.721
I MEAN, NO DISRESPECT,

22:34.721 --> 22:35.555
BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING

22:35.555 --> 22:36.556
I'M JUST LIKE, "[bleep], I NEED

22:36.556 --> 22:37.424
TO HURRY UP AND GET THIS VERSE.

22:37.424 --> 22:38.290
I NEED TO DO THIS."

22:38.290 --> 22:39.125
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING

22:39.125 --> 22:39.992
I'M WORKING TO DO.

22:39.992 --> 22:40.860
BUSINESS-WISE, I MEAN,

22:40.860 --> 22:41.594
THINK ABOUT IT.

22:41.594 --> 22:42.929
DIS RECORDS DO MAKE MONEY.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.497
ALL THE PROBLEMS I GOT GOING ON,

22:44.497 --> 22:45.432
WHY NOT?

22:45.432 --> 22:46.332
IF IT MAKES DOLLARS,

22:46.332 --> 22:47.233
IT MAKES SENSE.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.535
YOU KNOW WHAT, FINANCIALLY,

22:48.535 --> 22:51.103
IS AN AMAZING BUSINESS MOVE?

22:51.103 --> 22:52.572
IMBOSSY.COM.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.441
I HAVE A SUCCESSFUL APPAREL

22:54.441 --> 22:55.975
AND ACCESSORY ONLINE STORE

22:55.975 --> 22:57.744
CALLED IMBOSSY.COM THAT IS DOING

22:57.744 --> 22:59.145
EXTREMELY WELL ON THE INTERNET

22:59.145 --> 23:00.447
RIGHT NOW, BUT FOR THE LAST

23:00.447 --> 23:01.514
COUPLE MONTHS, I BEEN TRYING

23:01.514 --> 23:02.649
TO TALK TO KIRK ABOUT OPENING

23:02.649 --> 23:04.451
A PHYSICAL LOCATION IN ATLANTA,

23:04.451 --> 23:05.284
AND FOR SOME REASON,

23:05.284 --> 23:06.719
HE AIN'T IN AGREEANCE.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.220
IT MAKES SHORT-TERM, LONG-TERM

23:08.220 --> 23:09.589
MONEY ALREADY BY ITSELF.

23:09.589 --> 23:10.457
BUT YOU KNOW WHY

23:10.457 --> 23:11.157
I'M HESITANT.

23:11.157 --> 23:12.091
BECAUSE MOVING I'M BOSSY

23:12.091 --> 23:12.759
OUT HERE?

23:12.759 --> 23:14.594
THAT COMES WITH EMPLOYEES.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.128
THAT COMES WITH LIGHTS.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.497
THAT COMES WITH INSURANCE.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.264
IT COMES WITH A LOT

23:18.264 --> 23:19.131
OF LIABILITY.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.468
YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND, I'M NOT

23:21.468 --> 23:22.735
GONNA SLEEP WELL, GOING TO GET A

23:22.735 --> 23:24.103
BUSINESS AND DOING THIS AND THAT

23:24.103 --> 23:26.172
WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE IS, YOU

23:26.172 --> 23:27.474
KNOW, AT A KNEE.

23:27.474 --> 23:28.475
OF COURSE YOU WOULD WANT TO

23:28.475 --> 23:29.476
STEP IN AND HELP YOUR BROTHER.

23:29.476 --> 23:30.543
HE RAISED YOU.

23:30.543 --> 23:31.744
THAT'S YOUR BIG BROTHER.

23:31.744 --> 23:32.912
YOU WANT TO HELP HIS KIDS.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.146
BUT MY THING IS, DON'T BE

23:34.146 --> 23:35.381
SO QUICK TO SHELL OUT TENS

23:35.381 --> 23:37.249
AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WHEN

23:37.249 --> 23:39.118
YOU NEED TO BE ALSO SECURING

23:39.118 --> 23:40.853
OUR FUTURE FOR LATER.

23:40.853 --> 23:43.055
RIGHT NOW NOT THE TIME.

23:43.055 --> 23:43.956
I JUST LOOK AT IT, LIKE,

23:43.956 --> 23:45.391
YOU KNOW, LET US NOT MISS OUT

23:45.391 --> 23:46.959
ON SOMETHING THAT'S SO GREAT

23:46.959 --> 23:48.495
FINANCIALLY FOR US.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.830
LIKE I SAID, BUSINESS-WISE,

23:50.830 --> 23:52.031
THIS RECORD COULD BRING

23:52.031 --> 23:53.132
IN REVENUE.

23:53.132 --> 23:53.800
THIS IS CALLED

23:53.800 --> 23:54.967
THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.335
YOU'RE HERE TO ENTERTAIN.

23:56.335 --> 23:59.005
RIGHT NOW, THAT THING IS ON YOUR

23:59.005 --> 24:00.239
ENTERTAINMENT PLATE.

24:00.239 --> 24:02.308
ENTERTAIN.

24:13.019 --> 24:15.154
HEY, LADIES.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.122
LOOKING GOOD.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.524
Y'ALL LOOK NICE.

24:17.524 --> 24:18.558
THANK YOU.

24:18.558 --> 24:19.859
MIMI FINALLY DECIDED

24:19.859 --> 24:21.227
TO GO PUBLIC WITH HER NEW MAN,

24:21.227 --> 24:22.695
SO SHE INVITED ALL OF US OUT

24:22.695 --> 24:24.330
FOR A FEW DRINKS.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.231
I DIDN'T WANT TO STEAL THE

24:25.231 --> 24:27.166
SPOTLIGHT, BUT SOONER OR LATER,

24:27.166 --> 24:28.234
THE GIRLS WOULD HAVE NOTICED

24:28.234 --> 24:29.435
SOMETHING DIFFERENT, SO I JUST

24:29.435 --> 24:31.003
DECIDED TO COME OUT WITH IT.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.905
A LOT HAS BEEN GOING ON.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.273
GOOD, BAD, UGLY?

24:34.273 --> 24:35.107
WHAT?

24:35.107 --> 24:36.375
LOOK AT THAT FACE.

24:36.375 --> 24:37.109
I KNOW.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.010
SHARE, BITCH.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.078
Y'ALL SEE THIS HAND?

24:39.078 --> 24:39.912
WAIT, WHAT?

24:39.912 --> 24:41.681
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.

24:41.681 --> 24:42.982
I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.884
I NEED MY DRINK!

24:44.884 --> 24:46.352
[laughs]

24:46.352 --> 24:47.687
IT'S THE LEFT HAND.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.822
ERICA, WHAT?

24:49.822 --> 24:50.757
I'M LOOKING, LIKE--

24:50.757 --> 24:51.858
I SAW THIS,

24:51.858 --> 24:53.793
BUT THAT'S THE WRONG HAND.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.194
Y'ALL AIN'T TOGETHER NO MORE?

24:55.194 --> 24:56.195
HONEY.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.597
WENT THROUGH HIS PHONE.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.131
SEEN LETTERS AND JUNK, AND--

24:59.131 --> 24:59.799
LETTERS?

24:59.799 --> 25:00.567
DON'T BE GOING THROUGH

25:00.567 --> 25:02.068
NO PHONES AND [bleep].

25:02.068 --> 25:03.369
OH, WELL, I DID.

25:03.369 --> 25:04.036
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE

25:04.036 --> 25:05.004
EVERY RIGHT TO.

25:05.004 --> 25:05.838
IF I'M SUPPOSED TO BE BUILDING

25:05.838 --> 25:08.440
THIS TRUST IN YOU, WHAT'S WITH

25:08.440 --> 25:09.576
ALL THESE DIFFERENT FEMALES

25:09.576 --> 25:10.342
ALL THE TIME?

25:10.342 --> 25:11.978
SINCE THIS ENGAGEMENT.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.245
SINCE THE ENGAGEMENT.

25:13.245 --> 25:14.246
NO, THAT'S NOT COOL.

25:14.246 --> 25:16.583
WHY AM I WEARING THIS RING?

25:16.583 --> 25:17.750
YOU NOT COMMITTED TO JUST ME.

25:17.750 --> 25:18.618
YOU COMMITTED TO

25:18.618 --> 25:20.753
EVERY-GODDAMN-BODY.

25:20.753 --> 25:21.954
I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD

25:21.954 --> 25:23.222
TO THE GIRLS MEETING NIKKO,

25:23.222 --> 25:24.591
BUT NOW IT'S KIND OF, YOU KNOW,

25:24.591 --> 25:26.626
BITTERSWEET THAT I'M HEARING

25:26.626 --> 25:28.628
THAT ERICA AND SCRAPPY BROKE UP.

25:28.628 --> 25:29.896
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, WE WERE

25:29.896 --> 25:31.163
ALL TOGETHER, AND WE WERE AT HER

I WANT TO MAKE A TOAST

26:36.829 --> 26:38.665

38:05.751 --> 38:06.418
HE SAW YOU.

38:06.418 --> 38:07.085

38:07.085 --> 38:07.753

38:07.753 --> 38:08.587
SMASH! SEE YOU.

38:08.587 --> 38:09.254

38:09.254 --> 38:10.021
YOU SHOULD HAVE KEPT THAT

38:10.021 --> 38:10.689
WITH YOU AND HIM.

38:10.689 --> 38:11.523
NO, BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW IF

38:11.523 --> 38:12.991
HE WAS LYING TO ME, AND HE WAS

38:12.991 --> 38:14.460
STILL TRYING TO KICK IT WITH ME,

38:14.460 --> 38:15.193
SO I WANTED TO SEE

38:15.193 --> 38:16.662
WHO WAS LYING.

38:16.662 --> 38:17.363
LET'S KEEP IT REAL.

38:17.363 --> 38:18.397
I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT

38:18.397 --> 38:19.631
YOU GOT TO WATCH WHAT YOU SAY.

38:19.631 --> 38:20.932
I AIN'T GOT TO WATCH [bleep].

38:20.932 --> 38:22.167
I CAME HER--HER FACE--AND

38:22.167 --> 38:23.469
I ASKED HER A SIMPLE QUESTION.

38:23.469 --> 38:24.570
SHE ANSWERED IT LIKE A GROWN-ASS

38:24.570 --> 38:25.804
ADULT, AND THAT WAS THE END

38:25.804 --> 38:26.738
OF IT, AND WE WAS COOL.

38:26.738 --> 38:27.606
WE WERE WALKING DOWN, HAVING

38:27.606 --> 38:28.507
COFFEE, AND THAT WAS THE END

38:28.507 --> 38:30.041
OF IT, ALL RIGHT?

38:30.041 --> 38:31.843
WHY IS JOSELINE ACTING CRAZY

38:31.843 --> 38:33.011

38:33.011 --> 38:34.145

38:35.180 --> 38:37.082

38:37.082 --> 38:38.083

38:38.083 --> 38:39.651
ENOUGH WITH THE CHECKING.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.586
Y'ALL DON'T NEED TO DO THIS.

38:40.586 --> 38:41.420
WE WEREN'T DOING THIS.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.488
IF WE COULD COMMUNICATE--

38:42.488 --> 38:43.389
[sighs]

38:43.389 --> 38:44.189
WE WEREN'T DOING THIS THE DAY

38:44.189 --> 38:45.023

38:45.023 --> 38:45.691

38:52.097 --> 38:52.864
YOU WOULD HAVE KEPT IT REAL

38:52.864 --> 38:54.466
WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME.

38:54.466 --> 38:55.401
BECAUSE WHEN I--

38:55.401 --> 38:56.301

38:56.301 --> 38:57.436
WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME!
