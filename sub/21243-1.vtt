WEBVTT

00:14.639 --> 00:16.683
-Someone's gonna catch us.
-[Jonah grunts]

00:16.766 --> 00:20.228
We got away with this over the break,
but break's over.

00:20.312 --> 00:21.813
Oh, my gosh, you are bossy.

00:21.896 --> 00:24.482
[scoffs] If Zoë asks
where I was last night, I was shopping.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.568
Yeah, like anyone's gonna believe that.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.288
Oh, looky who I found.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.457
Less talking, more carrying me.
Go, horsey!

00:40.540 --> 00:42.709
-[Zig neighs]
-[all laugh]

00:42.792 --> 00:45.878
Hey! I didn't see you all break.
Did you get up to anything?

00:45.962 --> 00:47.755
Nothing at all. [chuckles]

00:49.924 --> 00:53.095
[chuckles] Is that a hickey? Oh!

00:53.678 --> 00:57.682
[chuckles] Oh, what a glorious day.

00:57.765 --> 00:59.684
-Who is he?
-Nope, nope. Not doing this.

00:59.767 --> 01:03.355
[chuckles] First day back
and already an illicit affair!

01:03.438 --> 01:05.273
So, Tiny, where's Shay?

01:05.357 --> 01:07.775
Training for track and field.
My girl's trying to get scouted.

01:07.859 --> 01:09.361
Don't change the subject.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.530
-Whoa, look who's back.
-[Esme chuckles]

01:14.282 --> 01:15.992
Tris, you're back! [chuckles]

01:16.076 --> 01:17.327
[Miles] Just one class a day for now,

01:17.410 --> 01:19.579
-but he's getting better every day.
-[chuckles]

01:19.662 --> 01:21.038
Sweet vampire bite.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.458
[Jonah] Oh, you got a hickey?

01:23.541 --> 01:24.917
Who gave you that?
Is he handsome?

01:25.543 --> 01:28.713
-He's hideous.
-Oh, come on, just tell us who it is.

01:31.007 --> 01:32.425
[both chuckle]

01:35.470 --> 01:37.555
Uh, is that a rookie mark?

01:37.639 --> 01:38.848
[sighs] Come on.

01:38.931 --> 01:40.433
Okay, what's this, huh?
Come here.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.144
[Goldi] We're having a funfair tomorrow!

01:42.227 --> 01:44.979
Bouncy castles, cotton candy.
I'm in.

01:45.062 --> 01:46.648
And we get the whole afternoon off.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.484
Not that I'm complaining,
but didn't we just come back from break?

01:49.567 --> 01:51.361
The admin wanted to make sure
we start off the semester

01:51.444 --> 01:54.156
-as stress-free as possible.
-[Esme chuckles]

01:55.365 --> 01:56.616
It's a suicide fair.

01:58.451 --> 02:01.163
What? Admin clearly thinks
that a few carnival games

02:01.246 --> 02:03.123
will stop everyone's depression.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.167
[scoffs] You're a little out of bounds.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.876
[Esme] Maybe you're out of bounds.

02:06.959 --> 02:09.379
What if bouncy castles
are someone's trigger?

02:09.462 --> 02:11.714
[chuckles] What? It's funny.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.553
She's back?

02:20.307 --> 02:21.308
Maya's here?

02:21.391 --> 02:22.559
[Maya sighs]

02:25.520 --> 02:26.688
[chuckles softly] Hey, guys.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.356
[softly] Hey.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.857
[stammers] How are you?

02:29.941 --> 02:33.153
Um, I don't know. I'm good, I guess.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.114
Stop treating her
like she's made of glass, weirdo.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.533
[both chuckle]

02:38.616 --> 02:40.034
-[Grace] Hey!
-Hi!

02:40.117 --> 02:41.661
-Let's go!
-[Maya] Okay.

02:44.414 --> 02:47.625
Can you guys believe that this is our
last semester in high school?

02:47.709 --> 02:48.960
-[chuckles]
-Mmm...

02:49.043 --> 02:50.795
Squish. I want a photo.

02:50.878 --> 02:52.505
[Grace and Maya chuckle]

02:56.843 --> 02:58.678
-Is that a hickey?
-[all laugh]

02:59.554 --> 03:04.183
♪ Whatever it takes
I know I can make it through ♪

03:05.893 --> 03:10.690
♪ And if I hold out
I know I can make it through ♪

03:14.819 --> 03:20.074
♪ Be the best, be the best
The best that I can be ♪

03:20.157 --> 03:22.577

03:30.668 --> 03:32.670
[Zoë over PA] You know what's better
than one bouncy castle?

03:32.754 --> 03:34.088
How about two bouncy castles?

03:34.171 --> 03:35.840
That's right, I said it...

03:35.923 --> 03:38.718
I'm gonna bounce in that castle
until I puke! [retches]

03:38.801 --> 03:40.345
Oh, gross. [chuckles]

03:40.428 --> 03:42.347
You guys are both gross.
But count me in.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.266
Uh, not me.
Bouncy castles are lame.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.184
-Who are you?
-Bouncy castles are amazing.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.311
Yeah, you used to love that stuff.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.646
Well, I don't anymore.

03:49.729 --> 03:53.316
So, uh, you can go plan
your puke party without me, okay?

04:01.366 --> 04:02.659
I know why you don't like bouncy castles.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.035
Because I'm older than seven?

04:08.122 --> 04:10.750
They just keep getting bigger,
and now I'm uncomfortable all the time.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.336
You just need a good bra.
I'll take you for a fitting after school.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.046
Pass.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.131
Does your back hurt after jumping jacks?

04:19.091 --> 04:21.886
And burpees and wind sprints and
just about everything else in gym class.

04:21.969 --> 04:23.930
And how about clothes?
Like, how they fit?

04:24.013 --> 04:27.058
[sighs] They don't really make clothes
for girls with my body type.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.018
The right bra will change all that.

04:29.101 --> 04:31.563
Did you know that 85% of women are wearing
the wrong bra size?

04:31.646 --> 04:32.647
It's a human rights issue!

04:32.730 --> 04:34.023
Oh, yeah,
right up there with world hunger.

04:34.106 --> 04:35.942
You're the one who's always
going on about equality.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.444
Don't you want to do
the same things as boys?

04:37.527 --> 04:39.279
Well, boys don't wear bras.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.489
But they do bounce in castles.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.165
[bell rings]

04:52.917 --> 04:54.586
Welcome to grade 12 art.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.505
For your first assignment,
you will partner up

04:57.589 --> 04:59.966
to recreate a famous
Renaissance painting,

05:00.049 --> 05:01.593
with you as the subject.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.386
I think I'd make a good Mona Lisa.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.598
Uh, do you mind if I partner
with Maya on this one?

05:06.681 --> 05:08.475
I just don't want her to be alone.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.435
You'd rather I be alone?

05:11.603 --> 05:12.729
Well, she's just been through a lot.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.273
[Esme sighs]

05:16.358 --> 05:19.402
Creepy camera guy is the only one
who's still flying solo.

05:20.778 --> 05:22.029
It's just for one project.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.115
Thanks for being so cool about it.

05:24.198 --> 05:25.367
[scoffs]

05:31.122 --> 05:34.166
He just wants to be there for her.
She almost died.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.752
Yeah, I was there.

05:36.878 --> 05:40.047
Doesn't mean he'll get back together
with Maya. It's just...

05:40.131 --> 05:42.341
It took them months to get over
their heartbreak when they broke up.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.135
[Maya] That's a good idea.

05:44.218 --> 05:47.514
[sighs] And Zig's never loved anyone
half as much as Maya.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.476
If they were so in love,
why did they break up?

05:51.559 --> 05:52.602
Jealousy.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.353
-Really?
-Yeah.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.856
Dude couldn't deal
with anyone else near his girl.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.817
Tiny, you're a wise man.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.278
I like to think so.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.910
Shall we make a masterpiece?

06:13.623 --> 06:15.249
-[all laughing]
-Okay.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.334
[Winston] Well...
[Zoë] Mmm-hmm.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.170
Please tell me you have a way
to hide this hickey.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.425
Way ahead of you. Take over for me?

06:25.760 --> 06:26.761
[sighs]

06:31.223 --> 06:35.102
And... voilà!

06:35.186 --> 06:36.854
No one will notice your moped damage.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.397
Moped?

06:38.481 --> 06:39.649
When you date someone in secret,

06:39.732 --> 06:42.193
because you don't want to be seen
with them in public.

06:42.276 --> 06:45.613
Yeah, it's like... it's fun to ride,
until someone sees you on it. Moped.

06:45.697 --> 06:46.781
People do that?

06:47.615 --> 06:49.033
Sadly, yes.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.619
Well, I don't.
He's nothing to be ashamed of.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.830
Then why don't you tell us his name?

06:53.913 --> 06:55.498
Because some humans value privacy.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.749
[Winston] Or maybe you're his moped.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.627
-[Zoë] Winston!
-[stutters] What?

06:59.711 --> 07:02.505
I mean, maybe there's a reason
he doesn't want anyone to know about it.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.258
[chuckles] Well, don't listen to me.
I'm... I'm an idiot.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.803
-A huge idiot.
-I already said that.

07:13.766 --> 07:14.767
[sighs]

07:15.602 --> 07:18.395
Just don't be upset
if this doesn't work, okay?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.690
-[Lola] Do you even have it on yet?
-Almost.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.818
All I'm saying is that like I've literally
tried every bra in the world, so...

07:24.861 --> 07:26.946
-Obviously not the right ones.
-What are you doing?

07:27.029 --> 07:29.115
I have to adjust it or else it's useless.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.411
It's not fair that I'm burdened
with these fat sacks.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.456
Band's nice and tight.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.791
Most girls would kill for those.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.960
Why? They always get in the way.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.253
Cups look good.

07:43.420 --> 07:45.673
When I was little, my mom
never used to do physical stuff with us

07:45.757 --> 07:47.884
because she had these big boobs and...

07:47.967 --> 07:50.344
I just don't want to miss out
on stuff like she did

07:50.427 --> 07:53.222
just because I was given
the worst genetic gift ever.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.267
Now you won't have to, okay?

07:56.350 --> 07:58.144
How does it feel?

07:58.227 --> 07:59.479
A little better.

08:01.438 --> 08:04.233
[chuckles] A lot better, actually.

08:04.316 --> 08:06.277
Mmm.
Wait till you see them under clothes.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.820
Well, it's not gonna be that different.

08:07.904 --> 08:11.323
Are you seriously still doubting me?
I have a gift, okay?

08:11.991 --> 08:14.410
Your life's about to change forever.

08:25.797 --> 08:26.798
[sighs]

08:29.008 --> 08:31.260
I think you should paint me into this one.

08:31.343 --> 08:32.554
The Birth of Venus.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.349
-But the Venus is nude.
-So observant.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.687
Uh... won't this bother your boyfriend?

08:40.770 --> 08:42.855
[scoffs] You mean
my boyfriend who'd rather be

08:42.939 --> 08:45.107
with sad little Maya than with me?

08:45.191 --> 08:47.860
[chuckles softly] I get it.
You're jealous.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.486
[scoffs]

08:49.571 --> 08:51.614
Why would I be jealous of a girl
who tried to kill herself?

08:52.699 --> 08:54.701
She's obviously a total headcase.

08:55.827 --> 08:56.911
When did she do that?

08:58.788 --> 09:00.623
You didn't know?

09:00.707 --> 09:01.958
During the play.

09:02.041 --> 09:05.294
I saw her during the play.
I helped her open the door to the roof.

09:05.377 --> 09:08.005
[sighs] I would not spread that around.

09:09.465 --> 09:10.883
[sighs] I could've stopped her.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.677
[scoffs] Whatever. She's fine now.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.762
Can we just forget about stupid Maya?

09:15.930 --> 09:17.264
[sighs] God knows I'm trying to.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.183
I should've known something was wrong.

09:19.266 --> 09:20.643
I thought she just wanted
to take pictures.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.687
[scoffs] Enough.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.236
Um...

09:31.195 --> 09:32.614
What are you doing?

09:32.697 --> 09:34.907
How else are you supposed
to paint me as Venus?

09:34.991 --> 09:38.369
Aw, do girls not get naked
for you back home?

09:40.121 --> 09:43.040
Don't be shy.
This is for educational purposes.

09:46.043 --> 09:48.713
So? Are we gonna make art or what?

09:54.176 --> 09:55.344
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:55.427 --> 09:57.889
-Did I do this right?
-Uh, let me see.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.310
[Grace] You simplified
the equation incorrectly.

10:03.394 --> 10:06.606
You need to divide the numerator by three.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.651
[whispers] Okay, what are you doing?

10:10.442 --> 10:11.736
I think we shouldn't be a secret anymore.

10:11.819 --> 10:12.904
I thought you liked being a secret.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.948
Do you only want to make out with me
when no one else is around to see?

10:16.032 --> 10:19.076
-So you... So you'd rather people watched?
-[sighs]

10:19.160 --> 10:21.203
Look, I don't want Frankie to know yet.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.997
This is about your ex?

10:23.080 --> 10:25.291
She was convinced you and me were
hooking up last semester.

10:25.374 --> 10:26.583
But we weren't.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.002
Okay, but, um...

10:28.085 --> 10:30.963
What if she...
I don't know, hurts herself?

10:31.047 --> 10:32.381
She wouldn't do that.

10:32.464 --> 10:34.884
Well, yeah,
we didn't think Maya would either.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.887
Look, I just wanna give Frankie some time
to recover from the breakup.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.847
She's really upset about it?

10:39.931 --> 10:42.266
-From what I've heard, yeah.
-[sighs]

10:43.434 --> 10:44.894
Okay. I get it.

10:44.977 --> 10:48.272
Plus, isn't it kinda fun to hide
in plain sight?

10:49.606 --> 10:51.150
[chuckles] No more hickeys.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.359
[chuckles softly]

10:53.319 --> 10:54.403
No promises.

10:57.824 --> 11:01.243
And my favorite part is the way
Maya used shadows

11:01.327 --> 11:02.704
to define my arms.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.832
Oh, yeah,
it was really hard to get that definition.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.624
-Hey!
-[Madame Jean-Aux] Nice work.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.421
-Who's next?
-We'll go.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.263
Uh, we decided to recreate
The Birth of Venus.

11:21.347 --> 11:26.060
We wanted it to be perfect, so I made Saad
focus on getting every last detail right.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.145
It was a lot of hard work,
but I'm sure you'll agree

11:28.229 --> 11:30.147
that the end result is extraordinary.

11:32.775 --> 11:35.652
May we present The Birth of Esme.

11:36.528 --> 11:38.489
-[murmuring]
-Oh, man.

11:38.572 --> 11:39.866
[student chuckling]

11:39.949 --> 11:41.993
Uh, Zig,
would you like to start the critique,

11:42.076 --> 11:44.453
since you also have firsthand
knowledge on the subject?

11:44.536 --> 11:45.788
This is totally unacceptable.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.164
Why would you choose that painting?

11:47.248 --> 11:49.250
Do you have a problem
with the way Botticelli,

11:49.333 --> 11:51.836
or, in this case Saad,
handles the female body?

11:51.919 --> 11:53.755
-Apologize to the class.
-For what?

11:53.838 --> 11:56.590
Degrassi has a policy on nudity,
which you've disregarded.

11:56.673 --> 11:59.761
So Zig can get naked for Maya,
but when I do it for Saad, it's an issue?

11:59.844 --> 12:01.387
I didn't get naked for it.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.306
[murmuring]

12:04.390 --> 12:06.392
-Wait, did you?
-[scoffs] Like you'd care.

12:06.475 --> 12:07.769
-It's not the same thing.
-Why not?

12:07.852 --> 12:10.479
-Because your breasts are exposed.
-[Esme] So are Zig's.

12:10.562 --> 12:13.024
I think you're the one who owes me
an apology, Madame Jean-Aux.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.608
-[scoffs]
-Degrassi also has a policy

12:14.691 --> 12:17.361
on equal rights. If Maya and Zig
don't get in trouble, neither should we.

12:18.737 --> 12:22.199
Fine. You're right.
Everyone should be treated equally.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.285
Detention for all four of you.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.247
-Happy now, Ms. Song?
-As a clam.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.089

[both laughing]

12:53.105 --> 12:55.024
-So? Any back pain?
-No, it's amazing!

12:55.107 --> 12:58.152
-I wanna go again. Can we go again?
-You already bounced?

12:58.235 --> 12:59.361
How'd you get
to the front of the line so fast?

12:59.445 --> 13:01.238
-Some guy let me cut.
-[Lola chuckles]

13:01.322 --> 13:03.740
That's, uh, quite the development.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.326
How's the cotton candy line?

13:06.285 --> 13:07.369
Twenty minutes?

13:07.453 --> 13:09.371
-[groans]
-That's like an eternity.

13:10.497 --> 13:13.835
-Uh, here, take mine.
-Wow, really?

13:13.918 --> 13:15.086
Why?

13:15.169 --> 13:20.716
Uh, because we're gonna line up
for the bouncy, uh...

13:21.884 --> 13:23.260
-Uh...
-[chuckles]

13:23.344 --> 13:24.761
[stammers] Goodbye.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.640
[chuckles] First you cut the line,
now you get free cotton candy.

13:28.724 --> 13:29.851
Told you that bra would change your life.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.229
Wait.
That... that wasn't because of my boobs.

13:33.312 --> 13:36.148
Of course it was. Did you not notice
Baaz kept staring at them?

13:36.232 --> 13:37.316
-Ugh.
-[chuckles]

13:38.775 --> 13:40.319
Uh, can we go?

13:41.070 --> 13:44.323
-What about jousting?
-Um, I'd rather just hang out, me and you.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.158
-If that's okay.
-More than okay.

13:48.785 --> 13:52.874
[sighs] Second day back and I'm already
in detention for something I didn't do.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.128
And yet, Maya got
a get-out-of-jail-free card. Big surprise.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.796
Don't act like this is her fault.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.842
You're the one who got naked
for some guy for no reason.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.553
-I didn't ask for that.
-Yeah, but you didn't stop her.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.682
-Why do you always get so crazy?
-[Esme scoffs]

14:13.019 --> 14:14.811
I'm the crazy one?

14:14.896 --> 14:16.730
Not Maya,
the one who tried to kill herself?

14:16.813 --> 14:19.233
-She's trying to get better.
-She's so selfish!

14:19.316 --> 14:20.651
She was sick, Esme.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.361
Of course you'd take her side.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.906
She could've done it somewhere else,
anywhere else,

14:24.989 --> 14:27.491
and I wouldn't have been
the one to find her.

14:30.786 --> 14:31.828
Whatever.

14:32.955 --> 14:33.956
Maybe I should kill myself,

14:34.040 --> 14:36.708
'cause I can't get
the image of her limp body out of my head.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.212
Might as well,
it runs in my family anyways.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.401
[Maya chuckles]

15:03.277 --> 15:04.946
[chuckles] Fruit to Go?

15:05.029 --> 15:06.488
They're my favorite.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.659
Which you know...

15:10.742 --> 15:13.120
'cause you've been talking
to my mom about my return.

15:14.496 --> 15:17.874
I just wanna help ease you
back into school.

15:18.792 --> 15:21.420
Make sure that you're not overwhelmed.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.297
And...

15:25.341 --> 15:26.383
I'm here...

15:26.467 --> 15:28.844
-[chuckles]
-...anytime you need to talk.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.180
Thanks. Mmm.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.057
Still getting used
to the special treatment.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.476
You'll actually serve
the detention next time, I promise.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.686
It's not just that. Friends, too.

15:39.146 --> 15:41.565
Everybody has feelings
about me coming back.

15:41.648 --> 15:43.525
-Like what?
-Worry.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.819
Sometimes guilt.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.490
[sighs]

15:49.573 --> 15:52.284
I feel like I owe them all
an apology or something.

15:52.368 --> 15:56.038
I'm sure, mostly,
they're just happy that you're alive.

15:57.789 --> 15:58.874
Yeah.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.211
-I am, too.
-[chuckles softly]

16:02.294 --> 16:03.963
When I think about last semester,
it's like...

16:04.546 --> 16:07.299
all that stuff happened
to a completely different person.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.136
I guess that's a good thing.

16:11.262 --> 16:15.849
My sister struggles with depression
and she always describes it as a veil...

16:16.808 --> 16:19.103
something that gets
between her real self and the world.

16:19.186 --> 16:21.313
Yeah, that's exactly how it feels.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.151
Uh...

16:25.776 --> 16:27.069
Oh, she's doing great.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.405
-[sighs]
-Has been for a long time.

16:30.614 --> 16:36.578
When I find myself dipping,
I just think about friends and family...

16:36.662 --> 16:38.705
Oh, and SoCalArt.

16:38.789 --> 16:41.833
-University would be cool.
-Well, they'd be lucky to have you.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.170
Can I go to the funfair?

16:44.253 --> 16:45.879
After all, I'm the reason
they're having it, right?

16:45.962 --> 16:47.214

[Frankie] Don't call me delusional, Lo.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.015
Jonah said "hi" to me this morning.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.516
You guys broke up, like, six weeks ago.

16:57.599 --> 16:59.476
Yeah, but the spark's still there.
[chuckles softly]

16:59.560 --> 17:01.603
And no face or headshots, people.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.273
I think he wants
to get back together. [chuckles]

17:05.732 --> 17:08.485
[Jonah] Okay, people,
first one to knock the other off wins.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.611
All right, any takers?

17:09.695 --> 17:10.946
I'll give it a shot.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.823
-[girl] Come on, Grace!
-Okay.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.200
[Jonah sighs]

17:19.455 --> 17:21.082
Grace! Chill! It's for fun.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.791
Nothing about this is fun.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.628
Grace, what is going on?

17:27.421 --> 17:28.672
Frankie thinks
you're getting back together.

17:28.755 --> 17:31.425
So? I don't want to be with Frankie.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.844
No, you just want to make sure
she's happy. But me? Who cares, right?

17:33.927 --> 17:36.180
Grace, I fell for you
when I was with another girl.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.973
Okay? That is complicated.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.767
So how long are we gonna sneak around?
Another month? Prom?

17:40.851 --> 17:42.311
Until I die?

17:44.980 --> 17:46.232
I'm not gonna be your moped.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.151
I promise you that is not what this is.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.986
Promises are for suckers.

18:07.919 --> 18:09.505
You're not, um...

18:10.964 --> 18:13.884
You're not seriously thinking
of killing yourself, are you?

18:15.552 --> 18:17.263
Who knows?
I'm crazy, right?

18:20.182 --> 18:22.268
I'm so sorry that I said that.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.936
But maybe you're right.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.855
I don't know.
After we found Maya...

18:26.938 --> 18:28.399
You've been thinking about your mom?

18:28.482 --> 18:31.360
She looked the exact same
when I found her.

18:33.362 --> 18:36.740
-I've been having nightmares again.
-I had no idea.

18:36.823 --> 18:38.659
Because you're always with her.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.541
I can't stop because...

18:48.669 --> 18:50.003
'Cause it's my fault.

18:50.837 --> 18:52.631
Your fault? We saved her.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.050
Yeah, but I kept pushing her away.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.095
What if she didn't make it?

19:06.895 --> 19:08.730
Then that would've been on Saad.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.444
What?

19:13.527 --> 19:15.821
He was the last person
who saw her the night of the play.

19:15.904 --> 19:19.283
Opened the door to the roof for her,
basically gave her an invitation.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.494
Plus, he did
all those creepy photos with her.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.246
If anyone should've done anything,
it was him.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.333
But he let her get sicker and sicker.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.294
-He knew there was something wrong.
-But he didn't stop her.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.796
Yeah. He did nothing.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.551
She might have been totally okay
if it wasn't for that guy.

All right.

I brought you some sports bras.

They'll provide more coverage
than the ones you returned.

Do you have anything that'll make
your breasts disappear?
