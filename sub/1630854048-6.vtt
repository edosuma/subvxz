-[P.A. beeps, echoes]

00:08.225 --> 00:10.271
RI'CHARD:
You want some candy? ]

00:12.055 --> 00:14.753
Want some vegetables?

00:14.797 --> 00:17.060
Oh.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.367
I know what you want.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.719
-Ta-da!
-Unc, I'm not a kid.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.286
Oh, this is not a toy.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.070
It's a medical device.

00:27.114 --> 00:30.856
See, you put
all your hurt in this end.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.772
Well, go ahead.
Want to give it a try?

00:36.645 --> 00:38.908
"I'm Dustin,
and my favorite uncle

00:38.951 --> 00:40.431
"just got me this

00:40.475 --> 00:42.868
"because he thinks
I'm five years old

00:42.912 --> 00:45.088
"and that it'll make
the bone marrow transplant

00:45.132 --> 00:47.134
suck less."

00:47.177 --> 00:49.919
And then out the other end...

00:49.962 --> 00:51.921
[high-pitched voice]:
I'm Dustin,

00:51.964 --> 00:53.488
and my favorite uncle
just got me this

00:53.531 --> 00:55.664
because he thinks
I'm five years old

00:55.707 --> 00:58.101
and that it'll make
the bone marrow transplant

00:58.145 --> 01:00.060
suck less.

01:00.103 --> 01:02.932
[indistinct chatter]

01:02.975 --> 01:05.108
-Yes, and we planned
for surgery today.
-Do you know how much pain

01:05.152 --> 01:07.676
-he's been going through?
-What-what's going on?

01:07.719 --> 01:10.244
[stammers]
They canceled the transplant.

01:10.287 --> 01:12.681
No. We didn't cancel it.
We're ready to go.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.987
-Then what happened?
-The donor canceled.

01:15.031 --> 01:16.728
He was supposed
to be here by 8:00.

01:16.772 --> 01:18.339
RI'CHARD:
Why? Why did he cancel?

01:18.382 --> 01:19.731
All we know is that
he promised his bone marrow

01:19.775 --> 01:21.168
-to someone else.
-DELIA: No!

01:21.211 --> 01:23.344
We-we-we need to talk to him.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.520
He insists on maintaining
his anonymity.

01:25.563 --> 01:27.391
I'm feeling manipulated.

01:27.435 --> 01:29.132
It's voluntary, of course.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.178
The bone marrow donor can
back out whenever he wants.

01:31.221 --> 01:32.744
Who are you calling?

01:32.788 --> 01:34.398
I'm calling work.

01:34.442 --> 01:36.096
Unfortunately,
there's no plan B here, sir.

01:36.139 --> 01:37.358
We're lawyers.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.447
There's always a plan B.

01:40.752 --> 01:43.059
What do you want me
to do about it?

01:43.103 --> 01:45.714
Find out who did it.

01:45.757 --> 01:47.411
Check the elevator
security camera.

01:47.455 --> 01:49.805
-They were off.
-The cameras were off?

01:49.848 --> 01:51.502
What the fuck?!

01:51.546 --> 01:53.374
-Maintenance was
working on them.
-Are you kidding me?

01:53.417 --> 01:55.245
The one day
some white supremacist puts

01:55.289 --> 01:57.378
"Blood and Soil" stickers
all over our elevator,

01:57.421 --> 01:58.901
-and the surveillance
cameras are off?
-They've been off for a while.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.859
-[phone ringing]
-Check the lobby camera.

02:00.903 --> 02:03.601
There's one hour when
somebody could've done this.

02:03.645 --> 02:05.603
Reddick and Associates.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.649
RI'CHARD:
Reddick & Ri'Chard.

02:10.217 --> 02:11.957
-Who's in today?
-No one. It's early.

02:14.612 --> 02:16.527
on a Zoom call in 15 minutes.

02:16.571 --> 02:19.051
And any associates you can
scrounge up, bring them in.

02:19.095 --> 02:20.575
Can I tell them
what this is regarding?

02:20.618 --> 02:23.317
It's a life-or-death situation.

02:25.188 --> 02:27.190
[maniacal laughter]

02:27.234 --> 02:29.366
[grunting]

02:29.410 --> 02:32.064
Unhand her right now,

02:32.108 --> 02:34.197
FEMALE VOICE:
Thank you, Julius.

02:36.068 --> 02:38.593
[laughs]
You did? How'd you know that?

02:38.636 --> 02:42.031
Because who else comes into
the office on Saturday morning?

02:45.861 --> 02:48.168
Ri'Chard wants everybody
thon a Zoom call in 15 minutes.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.954

What are you doing?

03:18.502 --> 03:19.851
I, uh, got to go.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.244
What? Where?

03:21.288 --> 03:22.941
To work.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.943
[both grunting]

03:24.987 --> 03:27.685
-I'll go with you.
-[chuckles]

03:27.729 --> 03:30.558
Um, no, no. I will, uh...

03:30.601 --> 03:32.777
I'll see you at St. Barts.

03:32.821 --> 03:34.344
Are you hiding me?

03:34.388 --> 03:35.911
Come on.

03:35.954 --> 03:37.391
Stop it.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.393
They don't know
you're gay, do they?

03:39.436 --> 03:41.525
Um...

03:41.569 --> 03:43.614
They don't know I'm anything.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.531
Lock the door.

03:47.575 --> 03:51.318
Why, why am I always
doing things for you?

03:51.361 --> 03:53.537
Everybody else does
things for me.

03:53.581 --> 03:54.973

[continues in Hebrew]

04:15.342 --> 04:17.300
[phone chimes]

04:17.344 --> 04:19.128
I got to get this.

04:19.171 --> 04:21.478
[Zev speaking in Hebrew]

04:28.050 --> 04:30.095
-We're all here?
-ALL: Yes.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.750
This is about
my 11-year-old nephew, Dustin.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.752
He has sickle cell disease.

04:34.796 --> 04:36.885
And he's been in and out
of hospitals

04:36.928 --> 04:38.539
-half his life.
He was supposed...

04:40.497 --> 04:42.369

How hard is it to find

05:00.735 --> 05:02.606
that Dustin

-Oh, my God!
-[Z-Yes. This is not good. rew]

05:09.134 --> 05:11.746
is being paid to donate
his bone marrow to someone else.

05:11.789 --> 05:14.401
-Which is illegal.
-Yes, but not unlikely.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.359
I need legal solutions.

05:16.403 --> 05:19.754
-Do you know who the donor is?
-No. We only know he's a male

05:22.539 --> 05:24.715
-Do we have any legal options?
-No-I don't think there's male

05:26.761 --> 05:29.546
Unless we can prove some
-manipulation of the process. le

05:31.592 --> 05:33.071
-to follow through on a gift.. e

05:34.638 --> 05:36.379
You'd have to prove
-to detrimental reliance.ift. e

05:39.556 --> 05:41.776
E-Either way, uh,

05:41.819 --> 05:43.430
let's work up the lawsuit.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.170
Uh, I'm getting court time
at noon.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.781
So we have to move fast.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.870
Uh, Carmen and, um...

05:48.913 --> 05:51.046
-Marissa.
-Right, um...

05:54.223 --> 05:56.704
and turn over every stone
for another option.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.360
The-the status on the database
changes hour to hour,

06:00.403 --> 06:02.884
so something might come up.

06:02.927 --> 06:05.365
-Uh, and meanwhile,
I need the partners--
-Okay, I'll come in.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.932
I'll-I'll work on the estoppel.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.807
Thank you.

06:15.549 --> 06:18.247
I'm not giving up on Dustin...

06:18.290 --> 06:21.032
until the Good Lord tells me to.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.996
Unfortunately,
I think I have to go.

06:28.039 --> 06:30.520
Can we schedule
another session on Monday?

06:30.564 --> 06:32.435
Certainly.
I hope you don't mind.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.132
I couldn't help overhearing
your Zoom call.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.787
The nephew of one of
our partners, it's just awful.

06:36.831 --> 06:39.268
I heard sickle cell.
You know, we volunteer here

06:39.311 --> 06:41.531
helping sickle cell patients
with pain management.

06:41.575 --> 06:44.099
It's way past that.
He-he has a week to live.

06:44.142 --> 06:45.579
I'm just saying, from my work,

06:45.622 --> 06:47.319
I'm on the board
for clinical trials.

06:47.363 --> 06:49.017
Well, what trials?

06:49.060 --> 06:51.236
Gene-editing technology.
You've heard of CRISPR?

06:51.280 --> 06:52.890
It's like that.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.544
Trials are proving
it cures sickle cell.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.590
Keep going.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.592
It works like a tiny pair
of scissors, snipping off

06:58.635 --> 07:00.507
the segment of the DNA
that causes sickle cell.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.900
That's been done? Successfully?

07:02.944 --> 07:05.468
-Yes.
-Well, then why would anyone
need a bone marrow transplant?

07:05.512 --> 07:07.688
They wouldn't.

07:07.731 --> 07:10.168
Gene editing is so new,
it's-it's only in trials.

07:10.212 --> 07:12.214
But the results are amazing.

07:12.257 --> 07:13.868
I know the doctor
doing the trials here

07:13.911 --> 07:15.347
in Chicago,
and I could introduce you.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.437
-You would do that?
-Of course.

07:20.918 --> 07:23.268
Bone marrow matches are
very rare.

07:23.312 --> 07:25.967
So I'm gonna need you both to...

07:26.010 --> 07:27.577
Came from the gym.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.840
I'm gonna need you to scour

07:29.884 --> 07:32.060
the donor databases.
There are three or four.

07:32.103 --> 07:33.627
-And what are we looking for?
-According to Ri'Chard,

07:33.670 --> 07:36.151
these are Dustin's
leukocyte antigens markers.

07:36.194 --> 07:37.544
What's our deadline?

07:37.587 --> 07:38.849
Well, the operation
can be pushed back

07:38.893 --> 07:39.894
till Monday,
but that's about it.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.243
-This Monday?
-Yes.

07:41.286 --> 07:42.505
We should check
social media, too.

07:42.549 --> 07:43.854
That's up to you.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.508
Uh, don't you want

07:45.552 --> 07:46.901
to work off the same computer?

07:46.944 --> 07:48.598
It's better
if we work separately.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.168
[shouting, clamoring]

07:53.211 --> 07:55.170
Dr. Singh,
thank you for hearing me out.

07:55.213 --> 07:57.564
No problem. Uh, come on.
They need me in triage.

07:57.607 --> 08:00.262
-Is it normally like this?
-No.

08:00.305 --> 08:01.916
I came in to check
on the trials,

08:01.959 --> 08:03.831
and protestors started fighting
around the corner.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.310
Give me the rushed version.

08:05.354 --> 08:08.444
Uh, his name is Dustin Gish.
Here he is.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.402
He's already in Chicago.
He can start right away.

08:10.446 --> 08:12.317
In fact,
he has to start right away.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.537
I told her you had one slot for
a compassionate use exception

08:14.581 --> 08:17.758
for sickle cell.
Life or death, Singh.

08:17.801 --> 08:20.543
Christina.
We'll need the paperwork ASAP.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.414
Just tell me where to send it.
We have it all collected.

08:22.458 --> 08:25.026
Clear a sickle cell
gene-editing examination for...?

08:25.069 --> 08:27.028
-Dustin Gish.
-No, what day?

08:27.071 --> 08:29.204
-Oh, Monday.
-Monday morning.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.423
-How old is Dustin?
-11.

08:31.467 --> 08:33.034
-Oh, shit.
-What?

08:33.077 --> 08:34.514
-Christina, never mind.
-What's wrong?

08:34.557 --> 08:35.906
11 is too young.

08:35.950 --> 08:38.039
-Who says?
-The FDA.

08:38.082 --> 08:41.172
I don't have authorization for
patients under 12. I'm sorry.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.826
Wait.

08:42.870 --> 08:45.437
[stammers] He's only
three weeks from his birthday.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.004
It doesn't matter.
This is the FDA.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.571
Wait until his birthday.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.225
He'll be dead by his birthday.

08:50.268 --> 08:51.574
Come on, Singh, what can you do?

08:51.618 --> 08:53.707
Nothing.
I don't make these stupid rules.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.535
If I get an "all clear"
from the FDA,

08:55.578 --> 08:57.449
will you put Dustin
in your trial?

08:57.493 --> 08:59.539
Diane, I don't understand.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.497
This isn't about bone marrow?

09:01.541 --> 09:03.325
No, it's gene splicing.

09:04.979 --> 09:07.721
We may have a chance for
a sickle cell clinical trial.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.984
The board has agreed

09:10.027 --> 09:13.640
to a compassionate acceleration
on its trial protocols.

09:13.683 --> 09:15.555
Wow.
Uh, how did you manage that?

09:15.598 --> 09:17.948
Uh, one of the board members
is a...

09:20.037 --> 09:22.431
an exemption from the FDA.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.085
What exception, Diane?

09:24.128 --> 09:25.695
The patient has to be 12.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.481
but I lied and I said
T it was in three weeks..

09:32.006 --> 09:33.747
I'll file an emergency motion,

09:33.790 --> 09:35.792
get a judge involved.
Uh, how much time do we have?

09:35.836 --> 09:37.794
The clinical trial starts
on Monday.

09:37.838 --> 09:40.405
Judge Nilsson.
He's, uh, he's on weekend call.

09:40.449 --> 09:43.060
-And he doesn't
like bureaucrats.
-Good.

09:43.104 --> 09:45.280
I'll make the call.
So, Diane, he-he'll need to hear

09:45.323 --> 09:47.630
from someone on
this clinical trial board.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.327
Can you get your friend
to testify?

09:50.328 --> 09:51.982
I'll try.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.680
Thank you.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.638
I just made the introduction.
You made the argument.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.640
-Now I'm embarrassed.
-What for?

09:57.684 --> 10:00.077
I need to ask another favor.

10:00.121 --> 10:02.645
RI'CHARD: Your Honor,
we're ready to go right now.

How long do I have before court?

22:03.670 --> 22:05.019
Uh, we're headed there
right now.

22:05.062 --> 22:06.847
Uh, Dr. Wattly,
we are so impressed

22:06.890 --> 22:09.371
with your insights
into racial disparity...

22:09.415 --> 22:11.373
I have this really bad taste
in my mouth.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.375
Could-could we make
a stop up ahead

22:13.419 --> 22:14.898
so I can get a pack of gum?

22:14.942 --> 22:17.031
Uh, it'll only take a minute.

22:17.074 --> 22:18.075
Oh, there!

22:19.120 --> 22:20.991
LIZ:
Uh... I don't know.

22:21.035 --> 22:22.341
I-I just need some gum.

22:22.384 --> 22:23.820
It-It's no big deal.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.261
[liquid pouring]

22:32.612 --> 22:34.396
So you're Carmen's...?

22:34.440 --> 22:35.832
Workmate.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.094
And you're...

22:37.138 --> 22:39.401
Her girlfriend.

22:39.445 --> 22:40.881
Hmm.

22:40.924 --> 22:42.361
So you noticed...?

22:42.404 --> 22:44.798
That we look alike? Yep.

22:44.841 --> 22:46.234
Is it...?

22:46.277 --> 22:47.453
Weird?

22:47.496 --> 22:49.063
Oh, yeah.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.371
What are we to read into that?

22:52.414 --> 22:54.155
I have no fucking idea.

22:54.198 --> 22:55.461
But tell Carmen to figure out

22:55.504 --> 22:57.158
who she really wants
to sleep with.

22:58.899 --> 23:00.422
JAY:
Marissa, I've got another.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.250
Oh, uh, okay.

23:02.293 --> 23:04.034
-It was just taken down
from the database.
-Okay.

23:04.078 --> 23:06.385
MARISSA:
Hello, is this Patrick Stringer?

23:06.428 --> 23:07.864
Yes, it is,
but I can't help you.

23:09.823 --> 23:11.738
Uh, you turn out to be
buta perfect match ou.

23:24.359 --> 23:26.535
I can't help you.

23:28.276 --> 23:29.582
Why not? What's wrong?

23:29.625 --> 23:31.018
If you're worried
about the operation,

23:31.061 --> 23:32.628
it's not as painful as...

23:32.672 --> 23:34.456
No, I'm not worried
about the operation.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.894
I don't know. Tell us.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.983
My sister just had
a kidney failure.

23:42.725 --> 23:45.554
I have to make a choice,
so I choose my sister.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.429
My sister is more important
so than a stranger.r.

23:55.390 --> 23:57.566
If I found a kidney
sofor your sister, .r.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.005

24:02.049 --> 24:03.703
Next week.

24:06.096 --> 24:09.317
and give me until
the end of the day, okay?

24:09.360 --> 24:12.451
We're experts at this kind
of organ search.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.323

24:15.366 --> 24:18.282
That's all I need. Just hope.

24:18.326 --> 24:21.372

There are groups of fetishists
who get off on donating organs,

24:59.280 --> 25:01.630

25:03.589 --> 25:05.765
Okay, okay.

25:05.808 --> 25:07.984
Uh, we-we're suing the NIH

25:08.028 --> 25:10.465
to pump more funds
into sickle cell research.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.858
And we're going after Medicaid.

25:22.608 --> 25:25.654
Dr. Wattly, you were
just supposed to get gum.

25:25.698 --> 25:29.136
I did. Let's go.

25:30.137 --> 25:32.879
[door opens, closes]

25:32.922 --> 25:34.968
The doctor should be calling
within the next hour

25:35.011 --> 25:37.492
to set up the appointment.

25:37.536 --> 25:41.322
You're saving Heather's life
and she is gonna be so grateful.

25:41.365 --> 25:42.802
Uh, do you think
I get to meet her?

25:42.845 --> 25:44.499
As soon as she's recovered
from surgery.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.893
I know that she is gonna want
to thank you personally.

25:46.936 --> 25:48.416
-WOMAN: What's going on?
-Uh...

25:48.459 --> 25:51.027
-Who is that?
-No, it's just, uh, someone. Uh.

25:51.071 --> 25:52.942
You've got ten seconds
to tell me who you are, lady.

25:52.986 --> 25:54.509
-Who are you?
-I'm his mother,

25:54.553 --> 25:55.945
that's who, and I'm ending
this conversation.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.686
-Don't contact him again.
-Mom.

25:57.730 --> 26:00.689
You need to stop promising
your organs to strangers.

26:09.350 --> 26:10.917
-[pouring liquid]
-Getting anywhere?

26:10.960 --> 26:13.136
-No. You?
-No.

26:14.660 --> 26:17.619
Oh, your-your friend
said she had to leave.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.187
Thanks.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.624
I saw you two talking.

26:22.668 --> 26:25.540
What was... what was that about?

26:25.584 --> 26:26.976
Nothing.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.631
The weather, favorite colors,

26:29.675 --> 26:31.415
how we look so much alike.

26:32.416 --> 26:34.157
Yeah, I noticed.

26:34.201 --> 26:36.638
Really? Just today?

26:36.682 --> 26:38.248
'Cause your friend
said to tell you,

26:38.292 --> 26:40.294
"Figure out who you want
to sleep with, then call."

26:40.337 --> 26:42.165
Oh, Marissa,
I met her in a club.

26:42.209 --> 26:43.863
She is nothing like you.
Nothing.

26:43.906 --> 26:46.909
And she started doing her hair
like that later.

26:46.953 --> 26:48.955
Got it.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.566
Are we not friends
because of that?

26:52.567 --> 26:53.742
No, we're friends.

26:53.786 --> 26:55.135
What are you talking about?

26:55.178 --> 26:56.658
No, we're not.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.660
We were, but we're not now.

26:58.704 --> 27:02.577
Look, I was... short with you
that time

27:02.621 --> 27:04.231
because I was frustrated.

27:04.274 --> 27:07.451
I can't show weakness in my job,

27:07.495 --> 27:10.585
and when I'm around you,
I tend to be...

27:10.629 --> 27:11.978
nicer.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.589
I make you nicer?

27:14.633 --> 27:16.635
No, that is not what...

27:16.678 --> 27:18.593
Well, okay, y-you do. Okay?

27:18.637 --> 27:20.726
Because I'm a good person:
just say it.

27:21.727 --> 27:23.380
You are a good person.

27:23.424 --> 27:26.427
Okay, good, because I've been
missing you as a friend.

27:26.470 --> 27:27.994
Yeah, I've been missing you.

27:28.037 --> 27:29.648
Clearly. You've been fucking
my doppelgaänger.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.519
Okay, I'm going back to work.

27:31.562 --> 27:33.608
[laughs]:
Wait.

27:34.565 --> 27:36.306
How've you been doing?

27:37.307 --> 27:38.700
Not great.

27:38.744 --> 27:40.354
Work is hard.

27:41.355 --> 27:43.357
Yeah. Me, too.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.838
Is that why the combat pants?

27:46.839 --> 27:48.231
Krav Maga, baby.

27:48.275 --> 27:50.103
I think I'm going
to ask my instructor out.

27:50.146 --> 27:51.495
Oh, really?

27:51.539 --> 27:52.975
I think he likes me.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.281
He'll probably drag me back
to a kibbutz,

27:54.324 --> 27:55.499
and want 12 children.

27:55.543 --> 27:58.111
-I could see that.
-All boys.

27:58.154 --> 28:00.766
You'll have to come visit me,
and we'll have a torrid affair.

28:00.809 --> 28:02.637
[laughs]

28:03.594 --> 28:05.727
Would it be weird if we hugged?

28:12.952 --> 28:14.257
Okay, help me out.

28:14.301 --> 28:15.911
I think I have a lead
on a kidney.

28:15.955 --> 28:17.478
CARMEN:
Good.

28:17.521 --> 28:18.958
[elevator bell dings]

28:22.091 --> 28:24.441
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Delia,

28:24.485 --> 28:25.834
for coming down here.

28:25.878 --> 28:27.749
Hi, Dustin. How are you?

28:27.793 --> 28:29.055
Great.

28:30.099 --> 28:32.754
Yes, actually,
you-you look great.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.974
I'd say this is one of
his better days, right, honey?

28:35.017 --> 28:37.106
It's, uh, the painkillers.

28:37.150 --> 28:38.586
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

28:38.629 --> 28:40.675
Um... Delia,
can I talk to you a second?

28:40.719 --> 28:42.633
Yeah.

28:42.677 --> 28:45.332
Listen, we're trying
to convince the judge

28:45.375 --> 28:47.769
to finance Dustin's
gene therapy,

28:47.813 --> 28:52.252
so we said he would die
within a week.

28:52.295 --> 28:54.471
That is true.

28:55.472 --> 28:56.996
But he doesn't look like that.

28:58.911 --> 29:01.783
You want him to look
not so good?

29:01.827 --> 29:03.176
I don't want to ask that.

29:03.219 --> 29:04.481
Just give me ten minutes.

29:04.525 --> 29:06.396
Dustin knows what you want.

29:06.440 --> 29:09.791
When I did my research
on funding for sickle cell,

29:09.835 --> 29:13.012
I wanted to compare it
to the funding available

29:13.055 --> 29:15.318
for another similar condition.

29:15.362 --> 29:16.624
And what was that?

29:16.667 --> 29:18.713
Cystic fibrosis.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.847
Like sickle cell disease,
it's inherited... [hiccups]

29:23.936 --> 29:27.809
And, uh, were there any
important differences?

29:27.853 --> 29:33.075
Sickle cell
affects 1 in 365 people,

29:33.119 --> 29:39.560
and cystic fibrosis
affects 1 in 2,500 people.

29:39.603 --> 29:43.782
So sickle cell disease
is much more common?

29:43.825 --> 29:45.261
Yes. Much more.

29:45.305 --> 29:47.307
Much, much more.

29:47.350 --> 29:50.832
-Much, much...
-Okay, so, uh,

29:50.876 --> 29:52.573
what did you conclude, Doctor?

29:52.616 --> 29:55.097
The main difference in funding

29:55.141 --> 29:59.841
is sickle cell affects
mostly Black people,

29:59.885 --> 30:01.930
and cystic fibrosis
affects white.

30:01.974 --> 30:03.323
Objection, Your Honor.

30:03.366 --> 30:05.194
Not in evidence.

30:05.238 --> 30:07.022
-We just put it in evidence,
Your Honor.
-Overruled.

30:07.066 --> 30:08.589
Seems pretty racist to me.

30:09.590 --> 30:11.940
Okay. I've heard enough.

30:11.984 --> 30:15.204
Give me 30 minutes
and I'll rule.

30:15.248 --> 30:16.945
Thank you, Your Honor.

30:16.989 --> 30:18.991
Dustin has spent
the last three years

30:19.034 --> 30:22.168
in and out of the hospital,
and I'm a single mom.

30:22.211 --> 30:25.954
So even if I get a windfall
or-or a gift or...

30:25.998 --> 30:27.956
[coughing]

30:28.000 --> 30:29.305
Um, Your Honor, can I...

30:29.349 --> 30:30.306
Oh, yes, please.

[laughs quietly]

30:50.718 --> 30:52.459
I like kids.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.072
What are your plans for my firm?

30:59.379 --> 31:02.469
I think it's our firm, isn't it?

31:04.384 --> 31:08.910
Your story about being
embarrassed by that firm--

31:08.954 --> 31:11.782
the name partner showing
how inadequate you were

31:11.826 --> 31:15.177
by using a laser pointer--

31:15.221 --> 31:17.701
that was my dad.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.791
Let's talk about this
another time.

31:20.835 --> 31:22.445
I'd rather right now.

31:22.489 --> 31:24.012
No. No.

31:24.056 --> 31:26.362
Now is about my nephew.

31:28.234 --> 31:30.149
JUDGE:
Okay.

31:32.368 --> 31:34.370
[sighs]:
Here's the bottom line:

31:34.414 --> 31:36.677
this court finds
the National Institute of Health

31:36.720 --> 31:39.071
liable for racial discrimination

31:39.114 --> 31:41.595
and rules that they cover
the cost

31:41.638 --> 31:42.988
of the gene editing procedure.

31:43.031 --> 31:44.293
Your Honor,
the NIH intends to appeal.

31:44.337 --> 31:46.600
Ms. Kuo, if you appeal,

31:46.643 --> 31:48.994
this boy won't have a definitive
answer for another year.

31:49.037 --> 31:50.734
Likely two.

31:50.778 --> 31:52.736
-He will die waiting.
-Actually, the unseemly haste

31:52.780 --> 31:54.782
with which this hearing
has been conducted

31:54.825 --> 31:56.740
is one of the issues
I intend to take up

31:56.784 --> 31:58.960
with the Seventh Circuit
Court of Appeals.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.092
What have you got?

32:00.135 --> 32:01.310
LIZ:
We won,

32:02.877 --> 32:05.010
DIANE:
Yeah, same here.

32:06.663 --> 32:08.491
they want to exhaust
their legal options.

32:09.971 --> 32:12.234
tCarmen and Marissa.

32:13.888 --> 32:15.759
Yes, we're doing our best
to make it work for today.

32:15.803 --> 32:17.457
-No, unfortunately
not that late.
-Uh-huh. Yeah, today.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.067
CARMEN:
We have a skin graft
if you need it,

32:19.111 --> 32:20.764
but we're gonna have to have
a promise from you.

32:20.808 --> 32:22.505
Oh, no, you wouldn't need
to do that. We would send...

32:22.549 --> 32:23.637
Well, it is getting a little bit
complicated with where

32:23.680 --> 32:24.986
we're getting the organs from

32:25.030 --> 32:26.509
but everything's gonna
work out fine.

32:26.553 --> 32:28.294
Oh, no, I'm-I'm sure
we can make that work.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.691
So Patrick donates his
bone marrow to Dustin Gish

32:34.735 --> 32:36.998
and in exchange, he gets a
kidney for his sister, Jenny,

32:37.042 --> 32:38.869
-but...
-The kidney was donated

32:38.913 --> 32:41.785
by the Valdez family
from a daughter dying of COVID,

32:41.829 --> 32:45.180
and they also have a son who
needs a lung lobe to survive.

32:45.224 --> 32:46.616
Jesus.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.531
I am inspired and depressed

32:48.575 --> 32:50.359
by what it takes to stay alive.

32:50.403 --> 32:52.796
CARMEN:
So we got the lung lobe
from the O'Briens.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.104
They need a skin graft
due to a recent infection.

32:56.148 --> 32:57.366
So where does that leave us?

32:57.410 --> 32:59.194
CARMEN:
Uh, one step away.

32:59.238 --> 33:01.370
We got the skin graft from a
young woman in Detroit, but...

33:01.414 --> 33:02.632
LIZ:
But what?

33:02.676 --> 33:04.678
She wants an egg donor.

33:04.721 --> 33:06.767
We don't have access
to any egg databases

33:06.810 --> 33:08.508
so... fun times.

33:08.551 --> 33:11.032
We were just about
to flip a coin

33:11.076 --> 33:12.425
to see who gives up an egg.

33:12.468 --> 33:14.122
-Oh, my God. [laughs]
-I actually think

33:14.166 --> 33:15.428
we were going
to arm wrestle for it.

33:15.471 --> 33:17.299
-Okay.
-But, uh, we warned them

33:17.343 --> 33:19.345
that the mother would either
be Black or Jewish

33:19.388 --> 33:21.042
so either one half of America
will hate their child,

33:21.086 --> 33:22.609
or the other half will.

33:22.652 --> 33:24.524
Oh, why stop there?
Maybe both halves will.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.047
You two are amazing.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.396
Three.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.224
RI'CHARD:
Three.

33:29.268 --> 33:30.878
I wish I had words. I don't.

33:33.098 --> 33:36.275
Wh-When Dustin is 20 years old
and about to go to college,

33:36.318 --> 33:40.540
I'm bringing him back here to
meet the people who saved him.

33:40.583 --> 33:43.325
You are all amazing.

33:43.369 --> 33:45.980
And, um, I have officially
adopted you.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.851
We're all family now.

33:47.895 --> 33:49.549
-[Ri'Chard laughs]
-All right.

33:49.592 --> 33:51.377
Heads or tails?

33:51.420 --> 33:53.727
Uh... tails.

33:55.207 --> 33:57.644
They're getting him ready
right now.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.298
We've got the bone marrow,
so we're ready.

33:59.341 --> 34:01.778
Thank you.
It has been such a strange day.

34:01.822 --> 34:02.953
-Thank you.
-Wait.

34:02.997 --> 34:04.172
Can I talk to my uncle?

34:04.216 --> 34:05.608
Yeah, uh, wait, Rich?

34:05.652 --> 34:06.827
Dustin's about to start
the treatment.

34:06.870 --> 34:08.089
He wants to tell you something.

34:08.133 --> 34:09.482
-Okay.
-Okay.

34:09.525 --> 34:11.179
-[squeaks]
-[recording]: Uncle Rich,

34:13.007 --> 34:15.836
and I'm going to spend my life
-[re making you proud.ch,

34:19.796 --> 34:21.929
[cries quietly]

34:24.105 --> 34:25.759
[sighs, sniffles]

34:25.802 --> 34:28.283
Kiss him for me.

34:28.327 --> 34:31.808
And, uh, just so you know,
we're-we're celebrating here.

34:31.852 --> 34:33.810
Tell him to get better soon,

34:33.854 --> 34:38.293
because he has made his uncle
too emotional tonight.

34:38.337 --> 34:41.209
I'll let you go. Love you.

34:42.254 --> 34:43.777
-RI'CHARD: Don't be stingy.
-[upbeat music playing]

34:43.820 --> 34:45.909
-[laughing]
-Thank you, man.

34:45.953 --> 34:48.216
-JAY: Yeah.
-[laughter]

34:48.260 --> 34:49.913
RI'CHARD:
Hey, Liz!

34:49.957 --> 34:52.133
Mal-Calm! Come on!

34:52.177 --> 34:53.700
All right,
just give me one second.

34:53.743 --> 34:55.789
I'm rearranging
our camping trip.

34:55.832 --> 34:57.182
Who wants to camp?

34:57.225 --> 34:59.923
Camp here. We got pizza.

34:59.967 --> 35:02.230
MALCOLM:
Oh, pizza is my survival food.

35:02.274 --> 35:05.233
[excited chattering]

35:05.277 --> 35:06.974
[music and chattering continue]

35:07.017 --> 35:10.760
I found a great idea
for a glamping site. I'll call.

35:10.804 --> 35:13.067
Butlers will bring you pheasant.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.721
It's wonderful.

35:14.764 --> 35:16.070
[laughs]

35:16.114 --> 35:20.944
First,
here's to a successful day.

35:25.949 --> 35:29.475
So, um,
are we having it out now?

35:29.518 --> 35:31.825
Well, I have some questions
that I want answered,

35:31.868 --> 35:33.914
so you tell me.

35:35.872 --> 35:37.657
Let's have it out now.

35:41.530 --> 35:42.966
What are you doing with my firm?

35:43.010 --> 35:45.926
Turning it into
the top firm in Chicago.

35:45.969 --> 35:48.189
Not the top Black firm,
not the top medium-sized firm;

35:48.233 --> 35:51.105
just the top fucking firm.

35:51.149 --> 35:53.107
With the Lord's help.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.501
-As revenge against my father?
-Yes.

35:56.806 --> 35:58.460
Sure.

35:58.504 --> 35:59.766
Which means kicking me out?

35:59.809 --> 36:02.203
No. Because you're
gonna help me.

36:02.247 --> 36:04.771
Do you know why?

36:04.814 --> 36:07.991
I originally thought
I would get rid of you

36:08.035 --> 36:10.907
and all your partners.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.649
But...

36:13.693 --> 36:15.173
Today.

36:16.217 --> 36:19.742
The way your team
works together.

36:21.657 --> 36:23.659
It's moved me.

36:24.878 --> 36:26.575
How sweet.

36:26.619 --> 36:29.491
[laughs]:
Look, Liz,

36:29.535 --> 36:32.146
I am a brand.

36:32.190 --> 36:35.541
Your father was a brand,
but he's toxic now.

36:35.584 --> 36:37.499
And that's why I'm taking over.

36:37.543 --> 36:39.849
But I want to keep all of you.

36:39.893 --> 36:43.462
Ri'Chard & Associates.

36:43.505 --> 36:45.551
[laughs]

36:47.640 --> 36:49.946
-Oh, my God.
-What?

36:49.990 --> 36:54.690
The arrogance here
is just blinding.

36:54.734 --> 36:57.215
My lawyers don't want to work
for a brand.

36:57.258 --> 36:58.433
Oh, sure, they do.

36:58.477 --> 37:00.130
If it's that or unemployment.

37:00.174 --> 37:02.655
We want to make a difference,
not sell T-shirts.

37:02.698 --> 37:04.004
Oh, my goodness, Noam Chomsky.

37:04.047 --> 37:05.658
How do you think we make
a difference?

37:05.701 --> 37:07.790
By all screaming
and waving our arms?

37:07.834 --> 37:10.750
No, by falling in
behind one name.

37:10.793 --> 37:14.449
One man. One parade.

37:14.493 --> 37:15.842
Ri'Chard.

37:15.885 --> 37:17.365
[laughs]

37:17.409 --> 37:19.628
You are so egotistical, it...

37:19.672 --> 37:21.935
Damn right, damn right, and
that's how you get things done.

37:21.978 --> 37:26.505
One name and an army behind it.

37:26.548 --> 37:30.073
It'd be your name, except...

37:30.117 --> 37:32.293
"Reddick" is over.

37:33.294 --> 37:37.167
My name is the next revelation.

37:39.735 --> 37:41.563
Well, we're gonna fight
for this.

37:41.607 --> 37:42.869
Oh, yeah.

37:42.912 --> 37:46.307
But first,
we get rid of STR Laurie.

37:47.569 --> 37:49.876
Then we can go at each other.

37:49.919 --> 37:51.965
[music and chattering continue
in other room]

38:08.111 --> 38:09.417
[phone beeps]

38:09.461 --> 38:13.465
Dr. Bettencourt, um,
I mean Lyle, hi.

38:13.508 --> 38:15.815
I just want to say thank you
for all you did today.

38:15.858 --> 38:17.469
It actually worked out.

38:17.512 --> 38:20.515
Dustin is going to get
his bone marrow transplant.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.952
So, just want to say thank you

38:22.996 --> 38:25.172
and I hope I can repay you...

38:31.352 --> 38:32.571
[gasps]

38:32.614 --> 38:34.660
[traffic sounds]

38:49.501 --> 38:51.546
[tires screeching,
horns honking]
