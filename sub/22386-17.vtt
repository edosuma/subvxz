06:05.599 --> 06:08.233
Mayor Goodway, are you okay?

06:08.235 --> 06:08.917
We're fine, Ryder.

06:08.918 --> 06:09.600
Mayor Goodway, are you okay?

06:09.603 --> 06:10.619
Ooh, Chickaletta,
we're being rescued!

06:10.620 --> 06:11.636
Mayor Goodway, are you okay?

06:11.638 --> 06:13.255
You've been so brave
during this ordeal.

06:13.256 --> 06:14.873
Mayor Goodway, are you okay?

Mayor Goodway, are you okay?

06:17.478 --> 06:18.327
Chase, traffic control.

06:18.328 --> 06:19.177
Mayor Goodway, are you okay?

06:19.179 --> 06:20.479
Chase is on the case!

06:20.480 --> 06:21.780
Mayor Goodway, are you okay?

06:25.853 --> 06:27.319
Whoa! Oof!

(Chuckling)

06:30.390 --> 06:30.655
Whoa! Oof!

06:30.657 --> 06:31.957
Let's use your winch
to pull the mayor's car out.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.258
Whoa! Oof!

06:33.260 --> 06:34.376
(Barking)
Winch.

Okay, pups, let's get
those train tracks cleared off.

08:16.897 --> 08:20.065
(Siren sounding)

08:20.067 --> 08:21.483
Hang on! I need
to clear the way.

08:21.484 --> 08:22.900
(Siren sounding)

08:25.539 --> 08:29.508
I hope Everest is
moving faster than we are.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.916
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

08:37.918 --> 08:38.867

08:38.868 --> 08:39.817
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

08:39.820 --> 08:41.920
Whoa, the engineer was right.
We need to clear the tracks.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.021
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

08:44.024 --> 08:44.523

08:44.524 --> 08:45.023
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

08:45.025 --> 08:45.807

08:45.808 --> 08:46.590
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

08:46.593 --> 08:47.192
<i> Hang on to your hats</i>

08:50.229 --> 08:51.695
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

08:55.669 --> 08:57.102
There you go, Ryder.

08:57.104 --> 08:57.886
The snow pile is clear.

08:57.887 --> 08:58.669
There you go, Ryder.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.054
But not those branches.

08:59.055 --> 08:59.437
There you go, Ryder.

08:59.439 --> 09:00.539
We'd better stop
the train while we move them.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.640
There you go, Ryder.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.258
(Beeping)
Mr. Engineer, Ryder here.

09:03.259 --> 09:04.875
There you go, Ryder.

09:04.878 --> 09:05.610
<i> How do the tracks look?</i>

09:05.611 --> 09:06.343
There you go, Ryder.

09:06.346 --> 09:07.279
Bad. You need to stop the train.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.213
There you go, Ryder.

09:08.215 --> 09:08.931
A big branch
fell across the tracks.

09:08.932 --> 09:09.648
There you go, Ryder.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.983
We have to clear it before
you come into the station.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.317
There you go, Ryder.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.735
Okay, Ryder,
I'll hit the breaks.

09:13.736 --> 09:15.152
There you go, Ryder.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.555
(Brakes screeching)

09:16.556 --> 09:17.956
There you go, Ryder.

09:18.425 --> 09:22.127
Ryder, the track's too icy.
The train isn't stopping.

09:23.497 --> 09:26.464
If he can't stop the train,
he'll hit the branch

09:26.466 --> 09:26.898
and jump the tracks.

09:26.899 --> 09:27.331
If he can't stop the train,
he'll hit the branch

09:27.334 --> 09:28.517
Chase, we'll use your winch
to drag the branches.

09:28.518 --> 09:29.701
If he can't stop the train,
he'll hit the branch

09:29.703 --> 09:31.019
Everest use your trail
clearing arm to move the trunk.

09:31.020 --> 09:32.336
If he can't stop the train,
he'll hit the branch

09:32.339 --> 09:34.122
Rubble, your shovel can
scrape the ice off the tracks

09:34.123 --> 09:35.906
If he can't stop the train,
he'll hit the branch

09:35.909 --> 09:36.491
so the train can stop.

09:36.492 --> 09:37.074
If he can't stop the train,
he'll hit the branch

09:37.077 --> 09:37.459
Let's go, pups.

09:37.460 --> 09:37.842
If he can't stop the train,
he'll hit the branch

09:37.844 --> 09:38.627
ALL:
We're on it!

09:38.628 --> 09:39.411
If he can't stop the train,
he'll hit the branch

09:39.413 --> 09:40.395
(Barking)

09:40.396 --> 09:41.378
If he can't stop the train,
he'll hit the branch

09:41.381 --> 09:42.414
Winch hook.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.448
If he can't stop the train,
he'll hit the branch

09:44.151 --> 09:46.785
I'll hook this
to the branches.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.171
(Barking)
Clearing arm.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.556
I'll hook this
to the branches.

09:51.558 --> 09:52.758
All ready, Chase.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.959
I'll hook this
to the branches.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.477
(Barking)
Winch.

09:55.478 --> 09:56.994
I'll hook this
to the branches.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.305
(Beeping)

10:07.307 --> 10:08.073
Great job, Everest.

10:08.074 --> 10:08.840
(Beeping)

10:08.842 --> 10:09.374
(Train whistle blowing)

10:09.375 --> 10:09.907
(Beeping)

10:09.910 --> 10:11.193
Here comes the train.
Hurry, Rubble.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.477
(Beeping)

10:12.479 --> 10:14.262
Rubble on the double!

10:14.263 --> 10:16.046
(Beeping)

10:16.049 --> 10:17.315
(Train whistle blowing)

10:17.316 --> 10:18.582
(Beeping)

10:22.255 --> 10:23.722
It looks like it's working.

10:23.724 --> 10:24.573
(Beeping)
Rubble, pull over.

10:24.574 --> 10:25.423
It looks like it's working.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.408
He should be
able to stop now.

10:26.409 --> 10:27.392
It looks like it's working.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.544
Rubble getting off
the track on the double.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.695
It looks like it's working.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.467
(Brakes screeching)

10:35.469 --> 10:36.718
The brakes are holding! Wahoo!

10:36.719 --> 10:37.968
(Brakes screeching)

10:37.971 --> 10:39.554
The train's stopping where
Rubble cleared the track.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.138
(Brakes screeching)

10:41.141 --> 10:41.840
ALL:
We did it!

10:41.841 --> 10:42.540
(Brakes screeching)

10:42.542 --> 10:43.558
(Howling happily)

10:50.751 --> 10:51.400
Thanks, Rubble!

10:51.401 --> 10:52.050
(Brakes screeching)

10:52.052 --> 10:53.268
No problem!

10:53.269 --> 10:54.485
(Brakes screeching)

10:54.488 --> 10:55.704
You got
Adventure Bay moving again.

10:55.705 --> 10:56.921
(Brakes screeching)

10:56.923 --> 10:57.739
What a bunch of good pups.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.556
(Brakes screeching)

10:58.558 --> 11:00.075
The bay is frozen solid.
Who wants to skate?

11:00.076 --> 11:01.593
(Brakes screeching)

11:01.595 --> 11:02.277
Let's hit the ice!

11:02.278 --> 11:02.960
(Brakes screeching)

11:02.963 --> 11:03.795
(Howling happily)

11:03.796 --> 11:04.628
(Brakes screeching)

11:04.631 --> 11:05.614
I was born to slide!

11:05.615 --> 11:06.598

Yeah! Woo-hoo!

What could I be forgetting?

13:22.918 --> 13:23.967
Whoa!

13:23.970 --> 13:25.570
That Adventure Bay doesn't
have a basketball team.

13:25.571 --> 13:27.171
Whoa!

that's just a disaster!

13:28.975 --> 13:30.775
Whoa!

13:30.777 --> 13:31.509
We can't beat Foggy Bottom

13:31.510 --> 13:32.242
Whoa!

13:32.245 --> 13:33.561
if we don't even
have a basketball team.

16:33.192 --> 16:35.459
¶ Marshall! ¶

16:35.462 --> 16:36.578
(Clucking)
(Laughing)

16:36.579 --> 16:37.695
¶ Marshall! ¶

16:37.697 --> 16:38.329
(Siren sounding)

16:38.330 --> 16:38.962
¶ Marshall! ¶

16:38.965 --> 16:40.515
(Tires squealing)

16:40.516 --> 16:42.066
¶ Marshall! ¶

16:42.068 --> 16:44.285
(Siren sounding)

16:44.286 --> 16:46.503
¶ Marshall! ¶

16:46.506 --> 16:49.240
(Siren continuing)

16:49.241 --> 16:51.975
¶ Marshall! ¶

16:56.816 --> 16:59.884
<i> Okay, team,</i>
<i> let's see some hustle.</i>

16:59.886 --> 17:00.602
(Grunting)

17:00.603 --> 17:01.319
<i> Okay, team,</i>
<i> let's see some hustle.</i>

17:01.321 --> 17:02.537
(Grunting)

17:02.538 --> 17:03.754
<i> Okay, team,</i>

17:03.757 --> 17:04.573
Whoa!

17:04.574 --> 17:05.390
<i> Okay, team,</i>

17:05.392 --> 17:06.091
Whoa!

17:06.092 --> 17:06.791
<i> Okay, team,</i>
<i> let's see some hustle.</i>

17:06.793 --> 17:08.193
A little too
much hustle, Marshall.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.594
<i> Okay, team,</i>
<i> let's see some hustle.</i>

17:09.596 --> 17:09.995
(Clucking)

17:09.996 --> 17:10.395
<i> Okay, team,</i>
<i> let's see some hustle.</i>

17:10.397 --> 17:11.246
(Whistle blowing)
Go, team!

17:11.247 --> 17:12.096
<i> Okay, team,</i>
<i> let's see some hustle.</i>

17:12.098 --> 17:13.615
Keep those paws up, Zuma.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.133
<i> Okay, team,</i>
<i> let's see some hustle.</i>

17:19.039 --> 17:20.138
(Barking)

17:20.140 --> 17:21.256
No!

17:21.257 --> 17:22.373
(Barking)

17:26.746 --> 17:29.213
Sorry, Marshall.

17:29.849 --> 17:32.617
<i> Alley-oop and</i>
<i> alley-up, you pups.</i>

17:32.619 --> 17:33.968
<i> Let's go, go, go!</i>

17:33.969 --> 17:35.318
<i> Alley-oop and</i>
<i> alley-up, you pups.</i>

17:37.357 --> 17:38.423
I got it!

17:38.425 --> 17:39.291
It's mine!

17:39.292 --> 17:40.158
I got it!

17:40.160 --> 17:41.076
Oof!

17:41.077 --> 17:41.993
I got it!

17:41.995 --> 17:42.861
(Clucking)

17:42.862 --> 17:43.728
I got it!

17:43.730 --> 17:45.964
With plays like these
it's going to be a great game!

17:45.965 --> 17:48.199
I got it!

17:48.201 --> 17:49.234
Okay, pups, take five.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.268
I got it!

17:50.270 --> 17:50.952
(Groaning)

17:50.953 --> 17:51.635
I got it!

17:51.638 --> 17:52.787
(Laughing)

17:52.788 --> 17:53.937
I got it!

18:00.380 --> 18:00.812
(Gasping)

18:00.814 --> 18:01.579
That's the team we're playing?

18:01.580 --> 18:02.345
(Gasping)

18:02.348 --> 18:04.282
Mayor Humdinger, meet
the Adventure Bay All-stars.

18:04.283 --> 18:06.217
(Gasping)

18:06.219 --> 18:07.936
Your team may have won every
game they have ever played--

18:07.937 --> 18:09.654
(Gasping)

18:09.656 --> 18:09.921
Every game?

18:09.922 --> 18:10.187
(Gasping)

18:10.190 --> 18:12.607
But get on the bus, Mayor, we're
taking your Boomers to school!

18:12.608 --> 18:15.025
(Gasping)

18:15.028 --> 18:16.494
(Chuckling)
A team of pups!

18:16.495 --> 18:17.961
(Gasping)

18:17.964 --> 18:18.329
Ha!

18:18.330 --> 18:18.695
(Gasping)

18:18.698 --> 18:19.697
I hope the pups
are ready, Ryder.

18:19.698 --> 18:20.697
(Gasping)

18:20.700 --> 18:22.400
All right, pups,
let's shoot some hoops!

18:22.401 --> 18:24.101
(Gasping)

18:24.104 --> 18:25.003
(Cheering)

18:25.004 --> 18:25.903
(Gasping)

18:25.905 --> 18:26.354
(Gulping)

18:26.355 --> 18:26.804
(Gasping)

18:26.806 --> 18:28.606
Ryder, I don't think
I should play in the game.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.407
(Gasping)

18:30.410 --> 18:31.342
But you practiced so hard.

18:31.343 --> 18:32.275
(Gasping)

18:32.278 --> 18:33.911
It's just, well,
if someone gets hurt,

18:33.912 --> 18:35.545
(Gasping)

18:35.548 --> 18:36.247
I want to be ready.

18:36.248 --> 18:36.947
(Gasping)

18:36.950 --> 18:38.333
Are you sure
that's the reason?

18:38.334 --> 18:39.717
(Gasping)

18:39.886 --> 18:43.754
Okay, you don't have to
play if you don't want to,

18:43.756 --> 18:45.840
but if you change
your mind, let us know.

18:45.841 --> 18:47.925
Okay, you don't have to
play if you don't want to,

18:47.927 --> 18:49.043
Hmm...

18:49.044 --> 18:50.160
Okay, you don't have to
play if you don't want to,

18:51.397 --> 18:52.029
(Growling)

18:52.031 --> 18:53.581
Okay, players, let's see
super sportsmanship

18:53.582 --> 18:55.132
(Growling)

18:55.135 --> 18:56.017
for this sporting spectacle.

18:56.018 --> 18:56.900
(Growling)

18:56.903 --> 18:57.802
(Whistle blowing)

18:57.803 --> 18:58.702
(Growling)

18:58.705 --> 18:59.287
Whoa!

18:59.288 --> 18:59.870
(Growling)

18:59.873 --> 19:00.805
(Barking)

19:00.806 --> 19:01.738
(Growling)

19:02.809 --> 19:06.644
Ha! Just let us know when you've
had enough, Mayor Goodway.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.479
Don't count your chickens before
they hatch, Mayor Humdinger.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.313
Ha! Just let us know when you've
had enough, Mayor Goodway.

19:10.316 --> 19:10.765
(Clucking)

19:10.766 --> 19:11.215
Ha! Just let us know when you've
had enough, Mayor Goodway.

19:11.217 --> 19:12.750
Oh, figure of speech, my dear.

19:12.751 --> 19:14.284
Ha! Just let us know when you've
had enough, Mayor Goodway.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.960
Drat it all!
(Cheering and barking)

19:28.268 --> 19:30.935
All right!

19:30.937 --> 19:32.520
Yeah, bring it down!

19:32.521 --> 19:34.104
All right!

19:34.107 --> 19:35.106
SKYE:
Yeah!

19:35.107 --> 19:36.106
All right!

19:36.109 --> 19:37.058
(Chuckling)

19:37.059 --> 19:38.008
All right!

19:39.812 --> 19:41.579
Mine! Shoot!

19:41.581 --> 19:42.680
(Barking)

19:42.681 --> 19:43.780
Mine! Shoot!

19:46.152 --> 19:49.086
I can't believe
the pups are ahead.

19:49.088 --> 19:50.521
I mean, go All-stars!

19:50.522 --> 19:51.955
I can't believe
the pups are ahead.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.042
(Chuckling)
You know what to do.

19:54.043 --> 19:56.127
I can't believe
the pups are ahead.

19:56.796 --> 19:57.995
(Barking)

19:57.997 --> 19:59.147
(Barking)

19:59.148 --> 20:00.298
(Barking)

20:00.300 --> 20:00.615
(Whistle blowing)

20:00.616 --> 20:00.931
(Barking)

20:00.934 --> 20:02.767
Foul on the Foggy Bottoms for
forcing that flippity flop.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.601
(Barking)

20:04.604 --> 20:05.420
(Whimpering)

20:05.421 --> 20:06.237
(Barking)

20:06.239 --> 20:06.638
Oh, no! Marshall,

20:06.639 --> 20:07.038
(Barking)

20:07.040 --> 20:08.540
Zuma and Rocky need
emergency medical attention.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.041
(Barking)

20:10.043 --> 20:11.292
Here I come, Ryder.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.542
(Barking)

20:13.279 --> 20:16.113
(Barking)
X-ray screen!

20:20.720 --> 20:22.086
No breaks.

20:22.088 --> 20:22.603
It's just sprained.

20:22.604 --> 20:23.119
No breaks.

20:23.122 --> 20:24.422
Thanks, Marshall.
(Barking)

20:24.423 --> 20:25.723
No breaks.

20:25.725 --> 20:26.975
Bandage!

20:26.976 --> 20:28.226
No breaks.

20:31.064 --> 20:34.465
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.099
No problem, Rocky.

20:35.100 --> 20:35.732
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.352
Now, let's put some
ice on your tail, Zuma,

20:37.353 --> 20:38.970
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.421
to keep the swelling down.

20:40.422 --> 20:41.871
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.374
Thanks... I guess.

20:43.375 --> 20:44.875
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.110
Marshall, you want to play?

20:46.111 --> 20:47.344
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

20:47.347 --> 20:47.796
What? Me?

20:47.797 --> 20:48.246
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.448
We need you, otherwise
we don't have enough players.

20:50.449 --> 20:52.649
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

20:52.652 --> 20:53.584
Uh, Ryder, you know,

20:53.585 --> 20:54.517
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.803
I'm kind of clumsy
with the ball.

20:55.804 --> 20:57.087
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

20:57.090 --> 20:57.989
But we want you
to play, Marshall.

20:57.990 --> 20:58.889
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.207
Yeah, it doesn't matter
how good you are,

21:00.208 --> 21:01.524
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

21:01.527 --> 21:02.443
you're a part of the team.

21:02.444 --> 21:03.360
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.513
No game is too big,
no pup is too small.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.664
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

21:07.667 --> 21:08.182
Marshall...

21:08.183 --> 21:08.698
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.101
ALL:
Marshall! Marshall!

21:10.102 --> 21:11.502
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

21:11.504 --> 21:12.153
Marshall!

21:12.154 --> 21:12.803
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

21:12.805 --> 21:13.821
Okay, I'll try.

21:13.822 --> 21:14.838
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.107
(Cheering)

21:16.108 --> 21:17.374
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

21:17.377 --> 21:18.309
(Whistle blowing)

21:18.310 --> 21:19.242
Oh, that feels better,
Marshall. Thanks.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.884
I got it!

21:28.821 --> 21:30.554
(Gasping, sighing)

21:30.556 --> 21:32.073
You'll get it
next time, Marshall.

21:32.074 --> 21:33.591
(Gasping, sighing)

21:34.961 --> 21:36.894
(Teeth chattering)

21:36.896 --> 21:37.462
(Teeth chattering)

21:37.463 --> 21:38.029
(Teeth chattering)

21:38.031 --> 21:39.164
(Yipping)

21:39.165 --> 21:40.298
(Teeth chattering)

21:40.300 --> 21:41.299
Oh, double drats!

21:41.300 --> 21:42.299
(Teeth chattering)

21:43.369 --> 21:46.070
(Barking)

21:46.072 --> 21:46.938

21:46.939 --> 21:47.805
(Barking)

21:48.675 --> 21:50.975
(Clucking)

21:51.544 --> 21:54.478
(Laughing)
Go Boomers!

21:59.786 --> 22:01.986
Marshall!

22:01.988 --> 22:02.620
Ah!

22:02.621 --> 22:03.253
Marshall!

22:03.256 --> 22:04.138
Whoa!

22:04.139 --> 22:05.021
Marshall!

22:05.024 --> 22:06.190
Whoa!

22:06.191 --> 22:07.357
Marshall!

22:07.360 --> 22:08.576
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:08.577 --> 22:09.793
Marshall!

22:09.796 --> 22:10.979
(Gasping)

22:10.980 --> 22:12.163
Marshall!

22:13.666 --> 22:16.300
(Buzzer sounding,
whistle blowing)

22:16.302 --> 22:18.302
Look, I made
a basket... with myself.

22:18.303 --> 22:20.303
(Buzzer sounding,
whistle blowing)

22:20.306 --> 22:22.023
(Barking and cheering)

22:22.024 --> 22:23.741
(Buzzer sounding,
whistle blowing)

22:25.345 --> 22:27.778
Great move, Marshall.

22:27.780 --> 22:28.512
You won the game!

22:28.513 --> 22:29.245
Great move, Marshall.

22:29.248 --> 22:30.298
Yee-haw!
What an effort!

22:30.299 --> 22:31.349
Great move, Marshall.

22:31.351 --> 22:31.866
What a game!

22:31.867 --> 22:32.382
Great move, Marshall.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.901
(Groaning)
Lost to a pack of pups.

22:33.902 --> 22:35.418
Great move, Marshall.

22:35.421 --> 22:36.320
(Groaning)

22:36.321 --> 22:37.220
Great move, Marshall.

22:37.223 --> 22:37.889
What a team!

22:37.890 --> 22:38.556
Great move, Marshall.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.274
If you ever need some
all-stars, just yelp for help.

22:40.275 --> 22:41.991
Great move, Marshall.

22:41.994 --> 22:42.393
(Laughing)

22:42.394 --> 22:42.793
Great move, Marshall.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.912
You've all been very
good pups and players.

22:44.913 --> 22:47.030
Great move, Marshall.
