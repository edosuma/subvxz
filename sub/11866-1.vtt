Walter?

00:55.847 --> 00:57.428
Walter, sweetie.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.801
Come to bed,
it's after midnight.

01:02.521 --> 01:03.681
Again.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.063
Walter!

01:07.109 --> 01:08.599
WAL TER: Be right there.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.141
Honey.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.898
Five more minutes.

01:11.947 --> 01:14.563
You need your sleep.
You know how you get.

01:14.658 --> 01:16.114
Another ﬁve minutes.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.192
Well, I'll be asleep.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.411
And don't even think
of trying anything
when you get up here.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.284
That ship has sailed.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.620
(BEEPING)

01:32.259 --> 01:33.715
(BEEPING)

01:34.386 --> 01:36.126
That works, right?

01:46.273 --> 01:47.604
Bingo.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.301
Oh, no.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.812
(THUNDER CLAPPING)

02:42.204 --> 02:43.694
I told you we should have
made a left back there.

02:43.789 --> 02:44.869
Don't make me
use pepper spray.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.412
Are all cops this angry?

02:46.500 --> 02:47.615
This isn't angry.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.748
l was angry
at the truck stop

02:48.835 --> 02:51.121
when you told the waitress
that I touched you funny.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.002
We're way past angry.

02:53.632 --> 02:56.089
Would it kill 'em to post
a road sign once in a while?

02:56.176 --> 02:59.464
Will you remind me
again why we're not
on a plane right now?

02:59.930 --> 03:03.093
Oh, that's right.
The big, bad marshal's
afraid to fly.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.593
You don't wanna
push me right now.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.767
Look, I'm just saying
that if we would've made
a left back there...

03:06.853 --> 03:09.014
Don't say anything.

03:10.399 --> 03:11.730
Fine.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.816
It's just funny and all...
Seriously, I'll pay you.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.773
I mean, you track me
across three states,

03:17.864 --> 03:20.355
you find me
in a city of, like,
half a million people

03:20.409 --> 03:22.365
and then you get us lost
on the way back.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.068
I mean, you gotta
appreciate the irony.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.329
Or not.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.367
We're not lost. We're just
taking the scenic route.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.409
Yeah, well, the scene sucks.

03:32.504 --> 03:33.493
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

03:33.547 --> 03:36.289
Whoa! Where did
that guy come from?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.840
Hey, high beams, moron!

03:51.523 --> 03:52.854
Was that...

03:53.400 --> 03:55.265
I mean, did you just see...
What?

03:55.360 --> 03:56.566
Us.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.644
I'm really not in the mood.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.731
We just passed
our car with us inside.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.817
And I thought
I was sleep deprived.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.026
I'm totally serious!

04:06.079 --> 04:10.197
So am I, so just take
a nap or something
so I can concentrate.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.615
Listen. Dog.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.325
No, you listen, homegirl.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.081
No! Dog!

04:29.603 --> 04:31.810
You call this
protective custody?

04:31.897 --> 04:33.762
You're okay.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.764
Wait, where are you going?

04:36.485 --> 04:37.850
To check the damage.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.605
And what if you
don't make it back?

04:39.654 --> 04:42.646
I'll be stuck in here like
those guys in the plane
who had to eat each other.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.447
You're right.
I know!

04:44.534 --> 04:46.320
Here. Here's some ketchup.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.305
For the last time,
there is no "other us."

05:12.395 --> 05:13.646
I know what I saw!

05:13.730 --> 05:14.936
What you think you saw.

05:14.981 --> 05:18.223
Look, it was an honest-to-God
paranormal encounter.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.900
You are an honest-to-God
paranormal encounter.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.605

Does that sense of humor
come with the badge?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.942
Civilization at last, huh?

05:28.245 --> 05:30.611
By whose definition?

05:32.290 --> 05:33.541
Come on.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.667
Hey, kid!

05:41.925 --> 05:45.417
Hey. Hey,
you got a sheriff
here in town?

05:45.554 --> 05:47.670
I'm not supposed
to talk to strangers.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.220
Oh, give me a break.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.683
You're absolutely right.

05:50.767 --> 05:54.259
And under normal
circumstances,
that's a great policy,

05:54.354 --> 05:57.596
but as it happens,
I'm one of the good guys.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.857
What grade are you in?

06:02.445 --> 06:06.438
Eleventh.
See that guy
picking up rocks?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.032
Yeah?

06:09.077 --> 06:10.908
Walk two blocks past him.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.863
Turn left at the stand
of deciduous trees.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.031
It'll be 60 meters
past the park.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.199
Great.

06:17.294 --> 06:21.037
"Deciduous"?
It means they shed
their leaves once a year.

I knew that.

this one to LA

that you could hang
onto the kid

dealt with the car.

go through this.

something's wrong.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.928
Well, maybe we should
just reconsider,

13:27.974 --> 13:30.260
tell them what happened.
I'm sure they'll understand.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.141
No, it's too late for that.

13:32.186 --> 13:35.269
But you said yourself,
we will never have
another opportunity like this.

trust me, Susan.

a lot of experience
at this kind of thing.

done with the introductions,
Mr. Carter...

Well, actually,
it's Marshal Carter,

19:34.674 --> 19:37.837
but you can call me Jack.

Hey, I don't like
to repeat myself.

me you're going to.

I'm not at liberty to say.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.232
Come on, Miss Blake,
we're on the same team.

19:55.319 --> 19:58.186
That's Agent Blake, Marshal,
and we're not even
in the same league.

19:58.239 --> 19:59.649
This is way out of
yourjurisdiction.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.405
Actually,
I'm a US. Marshal,

20:01.492 --> 20:04.859
so technically,
the United States
is myjurisdiction.

20:06.956 --> 20:11.165
Careful, though,
wouldn't want you disturbing
an active crime scene.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.996
Look...

20:13.963 --> 20:15.373
Brian.

20:18.843 --> 20:19.878

20:19.927 --> 20:21.042

20:21.721 --> 20:23.461

20:23.556 --> 20:24.545
It's okay.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.301
What are you doing?

20:26.600 --> 20:28.556
Relax, it's not blood.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.054
Then what?

20:30.146 --> 20:31.556
Chocolate.

20:32.732 --> 20:36.099
Hershey's Big Block
with almonds.

20:36.861 --> 20:39.227
How could you
possibly know that?

20:43.242 --> 20:46.075
Believe it or not,
I have done this before.

20:47.872 --> 20:51.035
But there's one small detail
I usually like to ascertain

20:51.083 --> 20:53.825
before launching
a full-scale manhunt
for a missing person.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.079
And that would be?

20:55.171 --> 20:58.504
That there is, in fact,
a person missing.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.130
Hi, Brian.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.427
Brian.

21:11.312 --> 21:13.143

21:13.272 --> 21:16.230
Were you hiding
in the RV the whole time?

21:16.275 --> 21:17.856
Yes.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.935
Everybody missed it.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.104
COBB: Not everybody.

21:27.286 --> 21:30.244
I guess he's
smarter than he looks.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.780
I'm gonna let
Jo handle it.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.866
No, no,
I'll handle him. I...

21:35.211 --> 21:38.248
No, Jo. She's perfect.
I need you to stay focused
on finding what caused this.

No,Jo!Jo!

21:40.466 --> 21:43.173

21:48.891 --> 21:50.802
It looks like you really
stepped in it, Marshal.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.762
It wouldn't be
the first time.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.177
I suppose I should thank you.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.353
How about you tell me
what's going on here instead?

21:56.440 --> 21:57.555
Sorry, Marshal, but...

21:57.650 --> 22:00.562
Yeah. Yeah, I know,
you're not at liberty to say.

22:00.653 --> 22:05.693
Oh, hey, Marshal?
One, oh, I don't know,
maybe two days.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.316

22:09.829 --> 22:11.490

22:11.831 --> 22:13.537

22:13.666 --> 22:15.327

22:15.417 --> 22:17.453
Come on, I have
a place you can stay.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.368
Really?
l'll drive.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.999
Yeah, no,
you can turn around. Yeah.

22:21.048 --> 22:24.211

We found Brian.

22:24.301 --> 22:25.461
TA GGART: Sheriff?
Yeah?

22:25.511 --> 22:26.921
That’s not all we found.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.968
Better come take a look.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.313
It's supposed
to be my day off.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.070
Yeah, well, I owe you one.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.315
Yes, you do.
Hey, Taggart.

22:50.661 --> 22:52.322
Watch your step.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.248
So what do we got?

22:55.332 --> 22:57.709
l was hoping
you could tell me.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.878
Careful. Poison ivy.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.719
It's over here.

in the back of the RV.

just the beginning.

that l was taking you
to my place.

No!

right now, this isn't

He's twice my age.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.032
You can get out now.
Yeah.

24:13.118 --> 24:18.112
You know,
Agent Blake, just because
you've dropped the subject,

24:18.165 --> 24:20.121
doesn't mean that l have.

24:20.167 --> 24:25.127
Marshal, whatever
you think is going on
with us, trust me, it's not.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.626
l was talking about the RV.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.459

Sorry,
some of my clients require
a certain level of discretion.

Clients?

Guests.
Yes.

Well, you look exhausted.

Thank you.

Here we go, nice and cozy.

Will your wife
be joining you?

25:41.790 --> 25:43.166
My wife?

25:44.209 --> 25:46.200
Oh, not likely.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.330
We're separated.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.041
Was it the sex?

25:50.215 --> 25:51.375
Excuse me?

25:51.467 --> 25:54.880
Well, it's a common problem
in long-term relationships.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.716
People get bored,
they want to
experiment sexually,

25:57.765 --> 25:59.721
and they don't know
how to express their needs.

25:59.767 --> 26:03.430
Well, not that
sharing my sex life
with a total stranger

26:03.520 --> 26:05.636
doesn't sound
like loads of fun,

26:05.731 --> 26:09.394
at the moment,
my needs are
a nap and a shower.

26:09.443 --> 26:11.058

their dog?

26:26.710 --> 26:28.211
Okay, what do you got?

26:28.253 --> 26:32.713
Inventory confirms it.
One of the Sentex chips
is definitely missing.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.750
From Section Five? That's
not possible, the security
cameras would have...

26:35.844 --> 26:37.800
Not if they were disabled.

26:38.097 --> 26:41.760
Some kind of
electromagnetic disruption
corrupted the entire system.

26:41.809 --> 26:43.470
Whoever did this
knew what they were doing.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.846
Okay, well, who has
access to that area?

26:45.938 --> 26:48.805
Besides yourself?
Yeah, besides myself, Fargo.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.473
Only people with
S-Five clearance.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.024
Not that I meant...

26:53.112 --> 26:56.275
Okay, look, I want you

44:20.992 --> 44:25.281
when Einstein realized that
our future was in the hands
of scientists, not soldiers.

44:25.329 --> 44:28.036
Wait, Einstein?
Like the Einstein?

44:28.124 --> 44:30.331
He convinced
President Truman
to create a haven

44:30.418 --> 44:33.160
where the world's greatest
thinkers could live and work.

44:33.212 --> 44:37.330
And since then,
most of our major
scientific breakthroughs

44:37.383 --> 44:39.749
have happened
right here in Eureka.

44:39.886 --> 44:41.296
Hold on.

44:48.019 --> 44:49.759
Put that on, please.

44:51.355 --> 44:52.891
Whoa.

45:03.534 --> 45:06.321
So where do you fit in,
in all this?

45:06.370 --> 45:09.703
I mean, no offense,
but you don't strike me
as the science type.

45:09.790 --> 45:11.075
I'm the government liaison.

45:11.167 --> 45:13.374
It's my job
to make sure the research
being done here is...

45:13.461 --> 45:14.576
Profitable.

45:14.670 --> 45:19.004
l was gonna say productive,
but building a better
tomorrow doesn't come cheap.

45:20.384 --> 45:22.340
Guess that explains
Fort Knox.

45:22.386 --> 45:25.378
Section Five restricted
to military projects only.

45:25.431 --> 45:26.466
Military? You mean weapons?

45:26.557 --> 45:28.934
Couldn't say. You need
NSA clearance to enter.

45:29.018 --> 45:31.179
Well, so much for building
a better tomorrow.

45:31.229 --> 45:32.844
Life is full
of compromises, Marshal.

45:32.897 --> 45:35.058
The tradeoff is
that Eureka has
the best of everything.

45:35.149 --> 45:37.014
School, housing, health care.

45:37.068 --> 45:39.480
I hope with
an emphasis on the latter,
after what I've seen.

45:39.570 --> 45:40.559
There are always risks.

45:41.530 --> 45:42.940
You've had problems before.

45:43.032 --> 45:44.738
Occasionally.
Like?

45:44.825 --> 45:46.440
Global warming.

45:47.411 --> 45:50.073
I'd like you to meet
one of our top scientists.

45:57.421 --> 45:58.922
(GRUNTING)

46:23.572 --> 46:27.235
Simulation off!
Fargo, this is not Level Six!

46:27.743 --> 46:29.483
Actually, that's Level Four.

46:29.578 --> 46:31.284
You mastered that last week.

46:31.622 --> 46:33.863
I could recalibrate
the system if it's
too advanced for you.

46:33.958 --> 46:35.914
WARREN: No. It's fine.

46:39.839 --> 46:41.454
Did you need something?

46:42.842 --> 46:44.628
Allison Blake's
on her way up.

46:44.719 --> 46:46.300
Sheriff Cobb was injured.

46:46.387 --> 46:49.094
Really? Better put on
my sad face.

46:49.807 --> 46:51.763
Hey, hey, hey! Easy, easy.

46:52.476 --> 46:54.467
It's not a toy.

46:54.979 --> 46:56.685
You could put
somebody's eye out.

46:56.772 --> 46:59.639
There's also a visitor,
a US. Marshal.

47:00.735 --> 47:01.850
ln Eureka?

47:01.944 --> 47:04.606
Maybe there's a dangerous
fugitive on the loose.

47:04.655 --> 47:05.770
Wouldn't that be exciting?

47:05.823 --> 47:06.858
Don't be ridiculous.

47:06.949 --> 47:09.941
I know, what was I thinking?

47:11.704 --> 47:13.365
But then again,

47:13.998 --> 47:16.080
why else would he be here?

47:21.213 --> 47:23.169
(ELEVATOR DOOR OPENING)

47:39.857 --> 47:41.597
What's all this for?

47:41.692 --> 47:44.775
Professor King is
trying to locate
the Point of Origin.

47:44.945 --> 47:46.401
Origin of what?

47:46.489 --> 47:50.653
Everything.
Life, the universe.

47:52.244 --> 47:54.530
It all had to start somewhere.

47:54.622 --> 47:58.365
Precisely where is
what I intend to find out.

47:58.459 --> 48:00.825
Professor Warren King,
Marshal Jack Carter.

48:00.878 --> 48:01.867
Oh.

48:01.962 --> 48:04.123
Professor King is
a Nobel laureate

48:04.215 --> 48:06.171
and noted astrophysicist.

48:06.217 --> 48:10.756
Wow, well, I'm captain
of my division softball team.

48:13.682 --> 48:15.422
It sounded better in my head.

48:15.518 --> 48:16.883
| see what you mean.

48:16.977 --> 48:18.353
Allison,
how's the Sheriff doing?

48:18.396 --> 48:19.886
He's still in surgery.

48:19.939 --> 48:23.181
But the Marshal
has agreed to help us
during his absence.

48:23.234 --> 48:25.395
The Marshal?
Oh, how generous.

48:25.486 --> 48:27.067
Well, you must find all
of this a bit shocking.

48:27.113 --> 48:30.071
Well, I'm from LA.
Nothing shocks me.

48:30.157 --> 48:31.818
| see.

48:34.286 --> 48:35.992
Well, almost nothing.

48:36.080 --> 48:39.288
Well, perhaps we should
justjump right in.

48:39.375 --> 48:40.410
Right.

48:40.501 --> 48:42.366
WARREN: It's right this way.

48:44.213 --> 48:46.499
We carbon-dated
the trees in and around
the event perimeter.

48:46.590 --> 48:48.922
They range in age from 12
to 1,200 years old.

48:49.009 --> 48:50.920
I take it that's not normal.

48:51.011 --> 48:53.263
What about that
sounds normal?

48:53.305 --> 48:56.718
Rapid aging like that can
only be caused by some
sort of quantum anomaly.

48:56.767 --> 48:58.598
And then there's the temporal
bilocation of the RV...

48:58.644 --> 49:00.100
I'm sorry,
come again?

49:00.187 --> 49:01.848
Temporal bilocation.
Fargo!

49:01.939 --> 49:04.897
Somehow, the back
half of the RV became

49:04.942 --> 49:07.900
momentarily isolated
from the front.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.355
lt's caught
in a different time stream.

49:09.447 --> 49:11.608
Where it ended up
was a direct result

49:11.699 --> 49:14.281
of the earth
rotating beneath it
during stasis.

49:14.368 --> 49:15.357
How is that possible?

49:15.453 --> 49:17.409
Well, it's a good question.
We're auditing
all active projects,

49:17.455 --> 49:19.992
but so far,
none of them seem related.

49:20.082 --> 49:21.822
Including yours?
Hold on!

49:21.917 --> 49:24.124
That's all right,
Allison, Marshal'sjust
being thorough.

49:24.211 --> 49:25.792
No, my research
involves using

49:25.838 --> 49:29.422
advanced pattern
recognition software
to trace cosmological events.

49:29.467 --> 49:31.833
So, unless you're
afraid of a little math...

49:31.927 --> 49:35.294
And what about Section Five?
Surely you have more than math
locked up in there.

49:35.347 --> 49:38.965
Details concerning
S-Five labs are all
strictly classified,

49:39.018 --> 49:42.602
but as far as I know,
nothing in there
could have caused this.

49:42.646 --> 49:46.264
As far as you know?
No offense, but
isn't it yourjob to know?

49:46.317 --> 49:47.807
Oh. Pushy.

49:47.902 --> 49:49.813
We should get back to work.

49:54.200 --> 49:58.819
Allison, keep me posted
on the Sheriff's progress.

49:58.913 --> 50:01.029
We're all pulling for him.

50:06.295 --> 50:07.660
Well, that wasn't
at all awkward.

50:07.713 --> 50:09.044
You want me to help,
this is me helping.

50:09.131 --> 50:12.498
Just lay off of Warren, okay?
He's not one of
your escaped felons.

50:12.551 --> 50:16.294
"Warren," huh?
Sounds like someone
has a crush on the teacher.

50:16.347 --> 50:17.712
(TIRES SCREECHING)

50:21.060 --> 50:22.516
Really gotta start
wearing my seat belt.

50:22.603 --> 50:24.389
Are you questioning
my professionalism?

50:24.480 --> 50:27.142
It was a joke, but I forgot
the DOD. doesn't have
a sense of humor.

50:27.191 --> 50:29.352
Well, maybe
you're just not funny.

50:30.778 --> 50:33.520
Look, I'm still trying
to wrap my brain
around all this.

50:33.614 --> 50:35.024
I don't know squat
about quantum physics,

50:35.115 --> 50:38.027
and to be perfectly honest,
I'm not sure whether
I can help you or not!

50:38.118 --> 50:41.702
But if you want me to try,
then I'm gonna have
to do my job my way.

50:41.789 --> 50:44.701
And for the record,
I'm all kinds of funny.

50:45.042 --> 50:46.748
Can I have my gun?

50:50.005 --> 50:51.541
Thank you.

50:54.176 --> 50:56.838
Oh, son of a...
Stop the car.

50:56.887 --> 50:58.423
Stop the car!

50:59.557 --> 51:01.343
Don't wait for me.

51:10.401 --> 51:11.481
What you reading?

51:11.569 --> 51:13.935

It’s all they have...

51:15.573 --> 51:17.438
Crap.
What are you doing
out of your cell?

51:17.533 --> 51:19.364
I'm getting takeout
for me and Jo.

51:19.410 --> 51:20.650
Turns out we have
a lot in common.

51:20.744 --> 51:21.733
Like what?

51:21.787 --> 51:25.120
Like fighting an oppressive
patriarchal society
to express our feminine power.

Vincent can make
anything you want.

51:28.961 --> 51:30.041
They don't even
have menus here.

51:30.087 --> 51:32.373

you name it, I got it.

Yeah, what the hell,
surprise me.

Special, coming up.

51:39.763 --> 51:42.846
So, where have you
been all afternoon?

51:43.767 --> 51:46.725
Yeah, about that.

51:49.231 --> 51:50.937
We should talk.

51:52.151 --> 51:54.642
Okay, please,
just give me the bad news.

51:54.737 --> 51:56.273
What does that mean?

51:56.322 --> 52:00.156
Well, the last time you
wanted to talk, you told me
you were moving out.

52:00.242 --> 52:03.780
No, no, and the time
before that, you said
that Grandma had died.

52:03.829 --> 52:04.909
Do you see the pattern here?

52:04.955 --> 52:07.116
No, it's nothing like that.

52:09.043 --> 52:10.453
Okay, yeah,
it's something like that.

be here for a while.

52:19.887 --> 52:21.502
I can't walk away from that.

52:21.889 --> 52:23.550
Since when?

52:23.807 --> 52:26.765
That's one Fugu-sashi,
one cheeseburger,

52:26.810 --> 52:31.144
and a side order
of salt-crusted yarns and
shaved white truffles to go.

to trip me up, she'll have
to do better than that.

with me to Beverly's?

not to spread that around.

to take a rain check

the inside scoop on where
things might be headed...

with where things started.

go back inside.

Marshal? What's going on?

54:18.255 --> 54:21.292
He's a nice kid. We chatted
in the park earlier today.

54:21.383 --> 54:23.169
Are you trying to be funny?

54:24.428 --> 54:25.759
No.

54:26.221 --> 54:29.133
My son has autism,
he barely speaks
to the people that he knows.

54:29.224 --> 54:31.886
I'm sorry,
ldidn't realize...

54:31.935 --> 54:34.768
I'm sorry.

54:35.272 --> 54:36.933
It's been a long day.

54:37.983 --> 54:39.268
I think I have a lead.

54:39.318 --> 54:40.603
But, as much
as I hate to admit it,

54:40.694 --> 54:43.902
I'm gonna have to run it
by your professor friend.

54:44.948 --> 54:47.200
WARREN: You called me here
to look at a map?

54:47.284 --> 54:48.899
What are those?

54:49.119 --> 54:51.656
CARTER: These are
the rough locations of
every reported anomaly.

54:51.747 --> 54:54.363
I'm well aware of Vincent's
tacky little pool, Marshal.

54:54.458 --> 54:57.200
Well, what are... We're
gonna start placing bets now,
is that your idea?

54:57.294 --> 54:59.626
No. Your pattern
recognition software traces

54:59.671 --> 55:02.708
cosmic events to
the point of origin, correct?

55:04.134 --> 55:05.999
What if the events
are a little more local?

55:06.094 --> 55:08.506
ALLISON: Could that
actually work?

55:08.806 --> 55:11.297
Yeah, in theory it could.

55:12.810 --> 55:14.971
It'd take a major
recalculation, though.

55:15.062 --> 55:18.304
Well, what's the matter,
Warren, are you afraid
of a little math?

55:18.398 --> 55:20.855
No, I'm not afraid
of a little math.

55:20.943 --> 55:23.150
It can't hurt to try,
though, right?

55:25.989 --> 55:29.652
It's a little simple,
but, okay, this'll take
a little while.

55:29.993 --> 55:31.529
May I drop you someplace,
Marshal?

55:31.620 --> 55:34.282
No, I'll walk.
I could use the fresh air.

ljust got off an 18 hour
flight from Indonesia,
so before you speak,

56:54.119 --> 56:56.485
consider the impact
this call will have
on your career

56:56.580 --> 56:59.037
if it's not
of monumental importance.

56:59.082 --> 57:00.367

57:00.417 --> 57:02.749
We 've got
a priority one situation.

57:04.212 --> 57:06.954
Wake up the Chairman
of the Senate
Appropriations Committee.

57:07.049 --> 57:08.914
Gather everybody
in the sit room.

57:08.967 --> 57:12.585
Tell them the topic
of discussion will be
"I told you so."

57:16.642 --> 57:20.180
Oh, man! The car.

57:21.855 --> 57:23.311
(HYPERVENTILATING)

57:23.607 --> 57:25.097
Breathe, Walter.

57:26.485 --> 57:29.101
Okay, now what happened?

57:30.906 --> 57:35.775
I got myself
involved in something.

57:36.370 --> 57:38.326
What do you mean?
I...

57:39.122 --> 57:40.862
The annual review
is coming up next month,

57:40.958 --> 57:43.119
and I told you
that l was struggling
to make my deadline.

57:43.168 --> 57:45.955
Yes, I know it was
causing some tension
with you and Susan.

57:46.004 --> 57:48.086
They said
they could help me.

57:48.131 --> 57:51.168
Slow down.
Who is "they"?

57:51.593 --> 57:54.084
I don't know.
I've never seen them.

57:54.930 --> 57:56.636
And they did help me.

57:58.433 --> 57:59.969
But now
everything's falling apart.

58:00.060 --> 58:01.175
(CREAKING)

58:01.269 --> 58:02.770
Who's that?

58:04.898 --> 58:06.308
Marshal?

58:06.817 --> 58:10.685
I saw a light on.
Hey, it's Walter, right?

58:11.947 --> 58:13.027
How's the family doing?

58:13.115 --> 58:14.150
Fine.

58:14.324 --> 58:16.656
(STUTTERING) And they're
probably waiting for me.

58:16.702 --> 58:17.987
So...

58:20.414 --> 58:23.201
Walter, we will talk
tomorrow, okay?

58:23.291 --> 58:24.747
Sure.
Okay.

58:26.962 --> 58:28.702
Everything okay?

58:28.839 --> 58:30.625
Emergency session.

58:31.758 --> 58:34.750
Normally, I try to keep
my evenings free,

58:35.053 --> 58:38.591
but as you're discovering,
this town is anything
but normal.

58:39.182 --> 58:41.514
Like your little
bed-and-breakfast.

58:41.852 --> 58:44.184
We all have
our roles to play.

58:45.689 --> 58:49.181
Now, I don't know
about you, but I could
really use a drink.

58:49.276 --> 58:51.642
Why don't you make
yourself comfortable?

58:52.112 --> 58:53.477
So how's his son doing?

58:53.530 --> 58:56.317
He'll be fine.
Kids are resilient.

58:56.366 --> 58:59.608
It's the adults
I worry about,
especially around here.

58:59.703 --> 59:01.694
If I was stuck
in this cracker farm,

59:01.747 --> 59:03.738
I'd probably
need a shrink, too.

59:03.832 --> 59:05.493
Who says you don't?

59:06.710 --> 59:09.292
And I prefer
"psychotherapist."

59:11.089 --> 59:15.708
Well, maintaining
relationships is tough
in your line of work.

59:15.927 --> 59:18.054
It helps to have
someone to talk to.

59:18.096 --> 59:20.883
Do what I do,
the job comes first.

59:21.224 --> 59:23.306
I imagine your
wife might disagree.

59:23.393 --> 59:25.258
She knew what she was
getting herself into.

59:25.353 --> 59:29.392
Still, the time away,
the distance.

59:29.441 --> 59:31.602
It must take
its toll on you, too.

59:31.735 --> 59:33.942
Especially with
a child involved.

59:39.743 --> 59:43.361
I tried a deskjob
when Zoe was born.

59:43.497 --> 59:47.206
Change to make others happy,
you end up making
yourself miserable.

59:47.250 --> 59:49.115
That's exactly
what I told Abbey.

59:49.211 --> 59:51.918
But she felt you were
choosing yourjob over them.

59:52.005 --> 59:54.417
Yeah, and I told her
it's not that simple.

59:54.508 --> 59:56.624
I mean, it's notjust ajob.

59:57.135 --> 1:00:00.673
I stop bad people
from doing bad things.

1:00:00.806 --> 1:00:05.049
Well, I'm sure that's
a tremendous comfort
when you go home at night

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:06.891
alone.

1:00:09.439 --> 1:00:11.179
So, you don't pull punches.

1:00:11.983 --> 1:00:14.941
I've counseled some
prominent people, Marshal.

1:00:15.237 --> 1:00:18.445
Diplomats, dignitaries,
even a few presidents.

1:00:18.698 --> 1:00:20.074
I knew that was him.

1:00:20.117 --> 1:00:22.984
They don't pay me
to pull punches.

1:00:25.622 --> 1:00:27.408
They want honesty.

1:00:36.299 --> 1:00:38.415
Easy, Marshal, it's us.

Aside from a bruised ego.

fall asleep on me before.

with my daughter.

1:01:03.660 --> 1:01:04.820

1:01:06.621 --> 1:01:08.157
And what about King?
Any luck?

1:01:08.206 --> 1:01:11.573
That's the good news.
He may have found
a point of origin.

1:01:11.668 --> 1:01:12.703
Where?

1:01:12.794 --> 1:01:14.910

lipstick on your collar?

1:01:30.478 --> 1:01:31.558
Right.

Oh, thank God,
l was just trying to call you.
Please, please. Come in.

1:01:37.068 --> 1:01:38.353
What's wrong?

1:01:38.403 --> 1:01:39.563
It's Walter.

1:01:39.654 --> 1:01:42.361
He's just...
He hasn't been himself,
he is so stressed out,

1:01:42.407 --> 1:01:45.740
and then after nearly
losing Brian in that thing
with the motor home...

1:01:45.827 --> 1:01:49.194
Susan, Susan, calm down.
Where's Walter?

1:01:49.247 --> 1:01:53.206
Okay, he came home late,
very late last night,

1:01:53.251 --> 1:01:55.958
and then just locked
himself in the basement.

1:01:56.046 --> 1:01:58.708
Something went wrong
with his experiment,

1:01:58.798 --> 1:02:01.540
and I think
he's been trying to fix it.

1:02:05.889 --> 1:02:08.380
You should stay
up here with me.

Colonel Briggs,
what do you think
you're doing?

1:04:25.487 --> 1:04:26.522
Something I should've done

1:04:26.613 --> 1:04:29.195
the last time one of your
little science projects
got out of hand.

1:04:29.282 --> 1:04:31.318
Eureka is
under D.O.D. jurisdiction.

1:04:31.368 --> 1:04:33.654
Was under D.O.D. jurisdiction.

1:04:33.703 --> 1:04:37.867
Now it's a matter
of national security,
which means you answer to me.

1:04:40.126 --> 1:04:41.662
Okay, let's move
that machine out of here!

1:04:41.711 --> 1:04:43.212
Idiot.

1:04:44.839 --> 1:04:46.545
So you two are close, then?

1:04:46.633 --> 1:04:49.591
You know, the boyish charm
act works better when
you're showered and shaved.

1:04:49.677 --> 1:04:52.214
Yeah, it's on my to-do list.
So, where they taking
that thing?

1:04:52.305 --> 1:04:53.715
Where else?

1:05:03.191 --> 1:05:06.308
Will somebody
please explain to me what
we're dealing with here?

1:05:06.403 --> 1:05:09.315
From what we can gather,
it's a prototype
tachyon accelerator.

1:05:09.406 --> 1:05:11.442
In English, Professor.

1:05:11.533 --> 1:05:13.945
I'll speak slowly
for your benefit, Colonel.

1:05:14.035 --> 1:05:17.903
A tachyon is a hypothetical
particle that travels faster
than the speed of light.

1:05:17.956 --> 1:05:18.991
Okay.

1:05:19.082 --> 1:05:20.743
No, that's not okay.

1:05:20.834 --> 1:05:22.540
Nothing can travel faster
than the speed of light,

1:05:22.585 --> 1:05:25.452
or the whole concept
of linear time
becomes meaningless.

1:05:25.547 --> 1:05:28.414
If Walter Perkins
created some sort
of tachyon collision,

1:05:28.508 --> 1:05:32.547
then time, as we know it,
ceases to exist,

1:05:32.595 --> 1:05:35.507
and the laws of physics
break down at the most
fundamental level.

1:05:35.598 --> 1:05:38.305
And if we don't stop this,
no one will be safe.

1:05:38.393 --> 1:05:40.258
Now this is why
I hate this town.

1:05:40.311 --> 1:05:44.350
Well, hang on, how could
Walter Perkins have even built
this without anyone knowing?

1:05:44.441 --> 1:05:46.932
He had to break
some major protocols.

1:05:47.026 --> 1:05:50.018
I mean, this is
a stolen Sentex prototype,

1:05:50.113 --> 1:05:54.698
strictly next-gen
military hardware.

1:05:55.368 --> 1:05:59.031
So the question is,
could Walter have
built this on his own?

1:05:59.122 --> 1:06:01.704
And where would he get
ahold of something like this?

1:06:01.791 --> 1:06:03.327
Section Five?

1:06:06.463 --> 1:06:08.795
Well, I don't see
how that's possible.

1:06:08.840 --> 1:06:11.832
But I guarantee you,
there'll be
a thorough inquiry.

two seconds before
I make him eat that rifle.

I don't care!
Stand at ease, Bud.

1:07:28.086 --> 1:07:30.953
I hate to interrupt,
but we have
bigger issues at hand.

The laws of physics
are breaking down.

Now, correct me if I'm wrong,

1:07:37.303 --> 1:07:40.420
but that's the kind of thing
that's not gonna stop
at the city limits, is it?

1:07:40.515 --> 1:07:45.179
A rift of this magnitude
will continue to grow
exponentially, unless...

1:07:45.937 --> 1:07:50.601
Henry, is it possible
Walter was trying
to create another collision

1:07:50.692 --> 1:07:52.148
when his machine blew?

1:07:52.235 --> 1:07:55.352
Right, theoretically,
the two events would
cancel each other out.

1:07:55.405 --> 1:07:59.694
I mean, it's sort of
like starting a backfire
in a brush blaze.

1:07:59.951 --> 1:08:02.363
Right, so if we can
get this one
up and running again...

1:08:02.412 --> 1:08:04.573
I've got some
Grade A hardware
in the garage.

1:08:04.664 --> 1:08:07.827
I mean, not like
what Walter was using,
but it should do the trick.

1:08:07.917 --> 1:08:10.078
Except for one small problem.

1:08:10.628 --> 1:08:13.005
Part of his formula
was lost in the blast.

1:08:13.089 --> 1:08:16.627
I mean, without it,
the accelerator's useless.

1:08:16.718 --> 1:08:19.505
Are you telling me
in this town
full of supergeeks,

1:08:19.596 --> 1:08:22.258
you can't find
one person who can do
a simple math problem?

1:08:22.307 --> 1:08:23.592
It's not that simple.

1:08:23.683 --> 1:08:28.268
Walter was our top
quantum physicist.

1:08:28.688 --> 1:08:30.098
Now, he could have
worked on this for months.

1:08:30.189 --> 1:08:31.224
CARTER: Oh, my...
What?

1:08:31.274 --> 1:08:33.481
HENRY: Years.
I don't know.

1:08:33.693 --> 1:08:34.933
I could swear
I've seen this before.

1:08:35.028 --> 1:08:37.485
HENRY: Even if we put
our top people on it,

1:08:37.572 --> 1:08:39.858
excuse me,
it's not gonna be
a walk in the park.

1:08:39.949 --> 1:08:41.735
BRIGGS: I understand that.

1:08:41.784 --> 1:08:42.944
I need to borrow
your car keys.

1:08:42.994 --> 1:08:44.074
Okay, what are you thinking?

1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:45.405
Trust me.

1:08:45.496 --> 1:08:47.327
Do I have any choice?

1:08:47.665 --> 1:08:49.621
Hey, watch yourself.

1:08:49.709 --> 1:08:50.744
Okay, right.

1:08:50.793 --> 1:08:53.705
Jo, I need to get out of here.
Do you think you can take him?

1:08:53.796 --> 1:08:56.754
Please.
He's Force Recon.

1:09:04.474 --> 1:09:06.430
JO: Hey, soldier boy.

1:09:13.483 --> 1:09:15.348

Go ahead, sir.

1:09:34.671 --> 1:09:36.502
Dad!
Honey.

1:09:37.715 --> 1:09:38.750
You okay?

1:09:38.841 --> 1:09:41.048
Yeah. What the hell's
going on?

1:09:41.803 --> 1:09:44.670
There's this machine
and a missing formula,

1:09:44.764 --> 1:09:46.755
a lot of science stuff
I can't explain.

1:09:46.849 --> 1:09:47.964
What are we gonna do?

1:09:48.017 --> 1:09:49.678
We aren't gonna do anything.

1:09:49.769 --> 1:09:51.350
You're gonna stay right here
where it's safe.

1:09:51.437 --> 1:09:52.847
Like hell!
I'm coming with you!

1:09:52.897 --> 1:09:54.512
Zoe, I don't have time
to argue!

1:09:54.607 --> 1:09:56.393
Which is why I'm gonna win.

1:09:58.861 --> 1:10:01.443
Okay. You stay by my side,

1:10:01.531 --> 1:10:03.567
you don't leave my sight,
not for a second,
you got it?

1:10:03.658 --> 1:10:05.194
Yeah.
Let's go.

1:10:05.868 --> 1:10:07.483

1:10:07.537 --> 1:10:09.152
Nice to see you,
too, Marshal.

1:10:09.205 --> 1:10:10.411
Nasty out there, huh?

1:10:10.498 --> 1:10:12.079
I think I can fix it.

1:10:12.166 --> 1:10:14.202
But I can't do it alone.

1:10:14.293 --> 1:10:15.544
How can I help?

1:10:15.628 --> 1:10:20.213
Actually, you can't,
but I'm hoping he can.

1:10:22.427 --> 1:10:24.213
(RUMBLING)

1:10:36.566 --> 1:10:38.227
All right, this has
gone on long enough.

1:10:38.276 --> 1:10:39.561
He just needs more time.

1:10:39.652 --> 1:10:41.688
Yeah, like 15 years
and a college degree.

1:10:41.738 --> 1:10:43.353
He's just a kid,
for crying out loud.

1:10:43.406 --> 1:10:44.521
Just give him a chance.

1:10:44.574 --> 1:10:47.566
Allison, maybe he's right.
We all know Kevin
has special talents,

1:10:47.660 --> 1:10:49.992
but this is just
too much, especially
under these conditions.

1:10:50.079 --> 1:10:52.786
Yeah. Yeah, it's not working.

buddy. Give that a try.

1:11:07.472 --> 1:11:08.803

Nothing.
It's all him.

what about the machine?

1:14:55.866 --> 1:14:58.323
We'll take it back
to the lab for analysis.

1:14:58.411 --> 1:14:59.526
And then?

1:14:59.620 --> 1:15:01.736
Then we'll lock it away
in a very safe place.

1:15:01.831 --> 1:15:04.618

99% of the equipment you use
to keep this country safe
was developed here.

So, when you're
ready to give that up,
you just let me know.

but I'll be watching.

it's not that simple.

was stolen from Section Five,

can't believe it.

was involved in some kind
of corporate espionage?

From whom?

1:19:48.617 --> 1:19:50.482
Walter wouldn't say.

1:19:50.619 --> 1:19:53.076
But I could tell
that he was frightened.

1:19:53.122 --> 1:19:56.330

working with someone else.

anyone else about this?

Mmm. No, but I will.

no idea how sorry
I am to hear that.

It took us a long time
to find the right candidate.

1:20:21.650 --> 1:20:24.858

access to Section Five.

Jo? It's Beverly.

1:20:55.601 --> 1:20:57.933
I'm over
at the Perkins' house.

1:20:58.020 --> 1:20:59.931
Susan's committed suicide.

1:21:01.023 --> 1:21:02.263
Yeah.

1:21:10.199 --> 1:21:11.405
Okay.

1:21:22.044 --> 1:21:26.959
Carter, these are Special
Agents Hicks and Miller,
Department of Defense.

1:21:27.091 --> 1:21:30.925
Look, is this is about
that thing I signed,
I didn't tell anyone.

1:21:31.011 --> 1:21:33.673
Actually, we're here
on behalf of the Major.
He was very impressed.

1:21:33.722 --> 1:21:35.713
You mean Colonel...
Colonel Briggs.

1:21:35.808 --> 1:21:38.345
No, Major William Cobb,
Army Intelligence.

1:21:38.394 --> 1:21:40.055
He said you two
worked together recently.

1:21:40.104 --> 1:21:41.560
Oh,
you mean the Sheriff?

1:21:41.605 --> 1:21:45.063
With his recommendation,
your security classification
and pay level will increase,

1:21:45.109 --> 1:21:47.065
effective immediately.

1:21:49.988 --> 1:21:51.944
Marshal. Sir.

1:21:54.576 --> 1:21:55.907
I don't understand.

1:21:55.994 --> 1:21:58.576
Relax, Carter.
It's a promotion.

1:22:01.083 --> 1:22:02.664
Congratulations.

1:22:03.460 --> 1:22:05.200
Define promotion.

1:22:39.663 --> 1:22:42.154
Yeah. Okay.

1:22:44.710 --> 1:22:47.167
Not the promotion
you were hoping for.

1:22:47.254 --> 1:22:50.838
No big deal.
You can do this, Jack.

1:22:52.342 --> 1:22:54.173
Make it happen.

1:22:54.678 --> 1:22:56.214
(EXPLOSION)

1:23:00.142 --> 1:23:01.678
(CRASHING)

1:23:13.780 --> 1:23:15.486
Jo, call Henry.
