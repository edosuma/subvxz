00:05.355 --> 00:07.801
Yo, C, can you take me to the beach, man?

00:08.195 --> 00:11.358
Will, you gonna take that
baseball to the beach with you?

00:11.595 --> 00:14.280
No, no, see, this isn't just a baseball.

00:14.835 --> 00:17.725
This is autographed
by "Say Hey" Willie Mays.

00:17.795 --> 00:21.242
I mean, I had to sell half your
coin collection just to buy it.

00:22.035 --> 00:24.356
Well, if you asked me, you're obsessed.

00:24.875 --> 00:26.081
L'm obsessed?

00:27.315 --> 00:30.762
Look, Carlton, you hurt his feelings.
Now, say sorry. Say it!

00:32.115 --> 00:35.403
L'm sorry. Will, seek help.

00:35.715 --> 00:37.843
Look, Carlton, can you just drop me off
at the beach?

00:37.915 --> 00:40.680
You know what, scratch that.
Drop me off a couple blocks away.

00:40.755 --> 00:44.362
The honeys might get a little
nervous if they see rne with a midget.

00:46.275 --> 00:48.323
Will, today is Senior Day.

00:48.395 --> 00:52.161
We're supposed to work on our college
applications and think about our futures.

00:52.235 --> 00:55.717
I am, and it's just that my future involves
a sweet, young thing in a thong.

00:55.795 --> 00:59.322
You know what l'm saying? You know?
Come on, let's jet, peewee.

00:59.395 --> 01:03.286
Forget it, Will. l'm not going to the beach.
l'm going to the library.

01:04.315 --> 01:05.760
Oh, really?

01:06.835 --> 01:10.442
Well, I got ten spankies here that said
you're going to the beach.

01:13.795 --> 01:15.240
They lied.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074

02:30.155 --> 02:32.396
G, can you please take me to the beach?

02:32.475 --> 02:35.160
So sorry, Master William,
l'm on a break.

02:37.395 --> 02:39.318
G, when is it going to be over?

02:39.395 --> 02:41.159
When you get another ride.

02:42.635 --> 02:46.606
Good morning, sweetheart.
Geoffrey, my bags are upstairs.

02:46.675 --> 02:48.245
How thrilling for you!

02:49.035 --> 02:51.276
Geoffrey, you know l'm very,
very fond of you.

02:51.355 --> 02:54.484
But I am also eight months pregnant,
and I am not in a very good mood.

02:54.555 --> 02:58.605
I could very easily rip out your heart,
eat it, and then have a cappuccino.

02:59.395 --> 03:01.363
Am I making myself quite clear?

03:01.635 --> 03:04.161
Hallmark couldn't have put it any better.

03:06.635 --> 03:09.559
You know, Aunt Viv, l'm really going to
miss you this weekend.

03:09.635 --> 03:12.525
No, you're not, and l'm not going
to miss you, either.

03:12.595 --> 03:15.838
Vivian, sweetheart, there was an army
ofants in my shower this morning.

03:15.915 --> 03:18.043
Welcome to the club, Philip.
Call the exterminator.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.116
And while you're at it, call...

03:19.195 --> 03:20.560
the garage door people and the plumber.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.125
I thought you were gonna
take care of that.

03:22.195 --> 03:26.200
Philip, l'm as big as a house.
All I want to do is lie in bed and eat pie.

03:26.755 --> 03:29.486
Me, too, but I still get things done.

03:32.195 --> 03:34.766
Guess what?
You're not going to believe this.

03:34.835 --> 03:36.724
You paid for your own dinner.

03:36.835 --> 03:41.124
Are you insane? l'm going to be
interviewed by the <i>L.A.</i> Weekly.

03:41.315 --> 03:44.842
Now that l'm a famous weather girl,
people want to know the real me.

03:44.915 --> 03:48.442
Now, if anyone asks,
l'm 21 and I fought in Desert Storm.

03:51.475 --> 03:53.921
Madam, l've put your luggage
in the limousine.

03:53.995 --> 03:58.000
Okay, goodbye, sweetheart. All right,
l'll give John and Sheryl your love...

03:58.075 --> 04:00.885
and I promise l'll try and come back
in a better mood...

04:00.955 --> 04:02.525
ifl come back at all.

04:03.315 --> 04:07.240
You know, Uncle Phil, if we're lucky,
she'll come back as Clair Huxtable.

04:11.795 --> 04:13.957
Look, a black Howdy Doody.

04:15.795 --> 04:19.560
That is my assistant, Edward.
Shame on you, Will.

04:19.675 --> 04:20.755
God!

04:23.195 --> 04:25.596
Good morning, Howdy... Edward.

04:26.635 --> 04:30.640
Good morning, Judge Banks.
I hope you don't mind the imposition...

04:30.715 --> 04:33.161
but I thought you could review your notes
on the way to court.

04:33.235 --> 04:36.318
Edward, even I can't drive
and read at the same time.

04:36.555 --> 04:40.321
Sure you can, Uncle Phil.
I do it every morning on the way to school.

04:48.075 --> 04:51.557
Actually, I took the liberty of putting
your notes on tape.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.845
Thank you, Edward.
It must have taken you hours.

04:55.035 --> 04:56.196
Three days.

04:56.475 --> 05:00.036
But I found it extremely enlightening,
not to mention rewarding.

05:00.115 --> 05:01.196
Yeah.

05:01.275 --> 05:03.118
Oh, I almost forgot one thing.

05:03.195 --> 05:06.119
If it's your nose, I think I know
where you left it.

05:11.155 --> 05:13.078
I was hoping to have a day off.

05:13.155 --> 05:15.317
I have an interview with a very prestigious
law firm.

05:15.395 --> 05:18.319
I have a very busy day today,
Edward, can't you postpone it?

05:18.395 --> 05:20.762
- Of course. l'd be happy to.
- Okay.

05:20.835 --> 05:23.042
L'll just wait another eight months.

05:23.235 --> 05:25.078
Go to the interview, Edward.

05:25.555 --> 05:27.876
Thank you, sir. Thank you again.

05:27.955 --> 05:30.083
And again, and again.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.726
Ed, do you want me to get you some
knee pads?

05:34.915 --> 05:38.522
Mr. Banks, the gardener left this for you.

05:39.155 --> 05:42.318
"Dear Mr. Banks, how can I put this?
Your wife is crazy, and you're cheap.

05:42.395 --> 05:44.124
"L quit, adios, Hector."

05:44.915 --> 05:46.041
Great, just what I need.

05:46.115 --> 05:47.605
Can I be ofassistance, sir?

05:47.675 --> 05:50.679
Yes, you can now call a gardener,
call an exterminator...

05:50.755 --> 05:53.201
find a plumber, and fix the garage door.

05:53.555 --> 05:56.081
Even Aladdin only got three wishes.

05:59.035 --> 06:00.196
What am I going to do?

06:00.275 --> 06:03.597
How am I gonna make it through the day
without an assistant?

06:06.915 --> 06:09.486
- Yeah, well, gotta go.
- Not so fast, Will.

06:10.115 --> 06:11.765
I really need your help.

06:12.555 --> 06:15.206
Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil.
Look, you know you my man, right?

06:15.275 --> 06:18.006
But come on, today is Senior Day.
I got to go down to the beach...

06:18.075 --> 06:19.201
and harass young women.

06:19.275 --> 06:23.246
Will, sometimes you have to put yourself
aside and do something to help others.

06:23.315 --> 06:25.124
You know, you right, Uncle Phil.

06:25.195 --> 06:28.199
And I see it. lt's like a vision.
l'm going to do that when l'm 30.

06:28.275 --> 06:31.358
Will, l'll never make it through this day
without help.

06:31.435 --> 06:35.759
Come on, like my father used to say to me,
"lt's better to give than to receive."

06:37.075 --> 06:40.318
Your pop had a bit of a
drinking problem though, didn't he?

06:43.315 --> 06:46.080
Get out of those clothes
and get in the damn car.

06:46.635 --> 06:49.400
A gentleman would at least give
rne dinner first.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.684
And if you want to stay out ofjail...

06:57.755 --> 07:01.965
I suggest you stop associating
with known criminals and low-life scum.

07:05.155 --> 07:06.236
<i>Jamal?</i>

07:06.995 --> 07:08.156
Will!

07:11.835 --> 07:15.282
What's happening, man?
Yo, man, you cool, that's my uncle.

07:15.355 --> 07:17.881
- Hey, Uncle Phil, this is--
- The defendant.

07:18.395 --> 07:21.126
- Sit down, Will.
- My fault. Sorry.

07:22.755 --> 07:24.598
Hey, Jamal, why don't you offer him
this Kit Kat--

07:24.675 --> 07:25.801
Will!

07:29.955 --> 07:31.525
Next case.

07:33.075 --> 07:34.565
Where are my files?

07:35.395 --> 07:37.966
I got them right here for you, Uncle Phil.

07:38.315 --> 07:41.125
You know, I just cleaning them up a
little bit, you know.

07:41.195 --> 07:43.960
- Why?
- I don't know, man.

07:44.035 --> 07:46.766
Some fool spilled some Slurpee or
something on them, I don't know.

07:46.835 --> 07:48.644
They cool, though.

07:50.355 --> 07:54.360
<i>The People versus Luther Devans,
case</i> number <i>3612.</i>

08:07.075 --> 08:10.966
What's up, baby? Why don't you stenog
your number down for me, you know?

08:12.675 --> 08:17.124
Girl, you look so good, I wish I could plant
you and grow a whole field of you all.

08:18.195 --> 08:20.197
Will, would you approach the bench,
please?

08:20.275 --> 08:23.597
- Yeah, just a second, Uncle Phil--
- Get your butt over here.

08:30.435 --> 08:32.961
Closer. Come on, a little closer.

08:33.315 --> 08:35.397
Come on. Come on.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.039
- Yes?
- Come on.

08:39.434 --> 08:41.676
May I remind you
that you are here to help me...

08:41.755 --> 08:42.836
not help yourself?

08:42.914 --> 08:45.805
Now, you sit your butt down
over there and shut up.

08:48.755 --> 08:50.644
Kong not hï¬‚PPY-

09:03.355 --> 09:05.642
Well, Counselor...

09:06.235 --> 09:09.603
I see that your client has violated
probation again.

09:10.115 --> 09:11.719
Why hasn't he found a job yet?

09:11.795 --> 09:14.639
He's tried, Your Honor,
but he hasn't been able to.

09:14.715 --> 09:16.763
We're here to request more time.

09:17.155 --> 09:20.876
Mr. Devons, I see you've served five years
in the penitentiary.

09:21.195 --> 09:23.118
L'm sure you learned a trade in there.

09:23.195 --> 09:24.959
Actually, I wrote a book, Your Honor.

09:25.035 --> 09:26.605
Word? That's kind of fly, man.

09:26.675 --> 09:30.077
Tell that to the publishers who
rejected me. I hate rejection.

09:30.355 --> 09:33.165
As a matter of fact, I wrote a book
of poetry about it.

09:33.235 --> 09:34.441
Mr. Devons...

09:35.515 --> 09:39.759
I find it difficult to believe that you've put
forth an honest effort to find employment.

09:39.835 --> 09:42.076
L'm willing to take any kind ofjob,
Your Honor.

09:42.155 --> 09:44.362
L'm good with my hands, I can fix
practically anything.

09:44.435 --> 09:45.800
Then why are you unemployed?

09:45.875 --> 09:48.606
L'm an ex-con.
Nobody wants to hire an ex-con.

09:48.675 --> 09:51.679
Oh, please, that's a very lame excuse,
Mr. Devons.

09:51.875 --> 09:56.039
Are you aware that l'm perfectly within
my rights to send you back to prison?

09:57.355 --> 09:58.686
Yo, Uncle Judge.

10:03.475 --> 10:05.477
Uncle Phil, you could give him a job.

10:05.555 --> 10:07.478
Are you crazy? He's an ex-con.

10:10.155 --> 10:13.238
Come on, Uncle Phil. All that stuff
that's broken around the house?

10:13.315 --> 10:17.400
And plus, l'm telling you, I got a good
feeling about this guy. Look at him.

10:19.435 --> 10:21.597
I don't think that would work, Will.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.799
Uncle Phil.
Remember what your pop said...

10:25.595 --> 10:28.201
"'Tis better to give than to receive."

10:29.715 --> 10:32.286
I really, really hate you.

10:34.195 --> 10:35.924
Love you, too, Uncle Phil.

10:40.715 --> 10:43.036
Yo, check it out, G, my Willie Mays
just went up again.

10:43.115 --> 10:45.163
I can get 300 spankies for this.

10:45.235 --> 10:47.522
$225, tops.

10:48.875 --> 10:50.764
I tried selling it yesterday.

10:51.875 --> 10:54.845
And when you finish mowing the lawn,
you can prune Mrs. Banks' roses.

10:54.915 --> 10:55.996
My pleasure.

10:56.075 --> 10:58.760
I have a date tonight, so would you mind
washing the car?

10:58.835 --> 11:01.520
And can you jack up the driver's seat
a little?

11:04.515 --> 11:07.359
And could you pick up my dress from
the dry cleanefs?

11:07.435 --> 11:11.440
While you're at it, could you type up your
thoughts on the industrial revolution?

11:11.515 --> 11:14.280
You know, double space it
and put my name on it?

11:16.395 --> 11:19.638
You dribble and you shoot, you know,
you hope for the best. What, what?

11:19.715 --> 11:23.515
L'll take care of everything right away,
and thanks again for the work.

11:24.035 --> 11:26.402
Hey, there's more where that came from.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.600
What a great guy.

11:29.675 --> 11:31.564
Incredible!

11:32.035 --> 11:34.083
L'm telling you, the dude got it going on.

11:34.155 --> 11:37.238
I mean, especially after spending
five years in the pen.

11:42.715 --> 11:46.401
The pen?
Please tell rne that's slang for the Valley.

11:49.235 --> 11:54.002
Look, now, don't everybody overreact,
but he did serve some time for burglary.

11:54.395 --> 11:56.443
Are you out of your damn mind?

11:59.835 --> 12:01.121
Ashley?

12:04.755 --> 12:08.362
Oh, my God, l've got to make myself
look less attractive.

12:09.595 --> 12:11.916
I know, l'll put on something of Mom's.

12:12.955 --> 12:15.322
L'm nailing down all of my dolls right now.

12:15.395 --> 12:17.318
- Me, too!
- Hey, hold it. Hold it!

12:18.275 --> 12:21.119
- Now the man has paid his debt to society.
- Yeah.

12:21.195 --> 12:23.436
He deserves a second chance,
like everybody else.

12:23.515 --> 12:25.995
- Whose idea was this?
- His.

12:27.635 --> 12:30.639
Will, you have put this entire family
in danger.

12:30.715 --> 12:33.195
This is the dumbest thing
you've ever done.

12:34.675 --> 12:37.076
Will, you are a genius.

12:37.155 --> 12:39.283
Luther is a godsend.

12:39.435 --> 12:43.759
He fixed all of the bulbs on my vanity
mirror. l'm even prettier than I thought.

12:45.795 --> 12:48.002
You know, Hilary, I don't even think
it's possible...

12:48.075 --> 12:50.476
for you to be prettier than you thought.

12:50.995 --> 12:52.804
Thank you, Will.

12:53.875 --> 12:57.322
Will, I fixed that TV in your room.
By the way...

12:57.395 --> 13:00.763
-you now get the Playboy channel.
- My man!

13:04.555 --> 13:06.045
I don't know, Will.

13:06.555 --> 13:09.798
I don't think l'd leave a convicted felon
alone in my room.

13:09.875 --> 13:12.560
But, what could you possibly
have of any value?

13:12.675 --> 13:14.518
What you talking about, man?

13:14.915 --> 13:16.644
How about for instance...

13:16.995 --> 13:19.123
my Willie Mays baseball.

13:23.555 --> 13:27.685
Look at the time, 4:00 already.
I better get some sleep.

13:29.275 --> 13:32.165
Where's my Willie?
Carlton, I can't find my Willie.

13:42.675 --> 13:45.884
Carlton, tell me that there's a baseball
in this thing.

13:46.715 --> 13:48.479
There's no baseball, Will.

13:48.755 --> 13:50.644
I guess you wasn't listening.

13:51.715 --> 13:54.605
Carlton, tell me that there's a baseball
in this thing.

13:54.675 --> 13:57.997
It's gone. Will, Luther's a thief.
What are we going to do?

13:58.115 --> 14:00.277
All right, all right, we don't know
that Luther did it.

14:00.355 --> 14:01.595
Come off it, Will.

14:01.675 --> 14:05.919
If it looks like a duck, smells like a duck
and sounds like a duck, what is it?

14:06.475 --> 14:08.000
Your prom date?

14:13.435 --> 14:15.164
I told you, she had a cold.

14:18.075 --> 14:21.397
Look, if you're so sure Luther didn't
take it, why don't you just ask him?

14:21.475 --> 14:23.204
I mean, he won't have anything to hide.

14:23.275 --> 14:26.643
Come on, Carlton, you can't just walk up
to people and accuse them of stuff.

14:26.715 --> 14:28.240
You think he did it, you ask him.

14:28.315 --> 14:31.762
Right. Like l'm just going to march up to
a vicious, hardened criminal and say...

14:31.835 --> 14:36.204
"Hey, mister, can I have my ball back, and
please don't snap my neck like a twig."

14:37.595 --> 14:41.680
Will, you have to be clever to outthink
the criminal mind.

14:42.475 --> 14:44.443
- Hey, Luther.
- Hey, Luther, how are you doing?

14:44.515 --> 14:45.721
That's Luther.

14:46.715 --> 14:48.604
L'll find out if he's honest.

14:57.555 --> 15:01.196
- Hey, Luther, you dropped your wallet.
- No, that's yours.

15:04.155 --> 15:05.600
So it is.

15:07.195 --> 15:10.278
How honest of you to say so.

15:15.275 --> 15:19.724
So, Luther, basebalfs a fine game, isn't it?

15:20.275 --> 15:21.322
Oh, yeah.

15:24.235 --> 15:25.316
Carlton...

15:25.915 --> 15:28.077
-can I have a word with you?
- Sure.

15:30.275 --> 15:33.757
The word is "idiot," man.
Can't you see he's innocent?

15:34.315 --> 15:38.081
L'm going to buy myself some lumber.
I want to get started on that trellis.

15:38.155 --> 15:41.921
Good for you, Luther.
Look, nice talking to you, Luther.

15:41.995 --> 15:44.157
You're doing a darn good job, Luther.

15:44.235 --> 15:46.476
Look, great having you aboard, Luther.

15:46.555 --> 15:48.284
- Thanks.
- See you, Luther.

15:49.435 --> 15:52.279
- Luther's guilty, Will, l'm going to tell Dad.
- No, you're not, man.

15:52.355 --> 15:53.880
Because if you do, l'm going to tell him...

15:53.955 --> 15:56.925
about them calls you been making
to 1-900-HORNY.

15:56.995 --> 15:58.201
You wouldn't.

15:58.755 --> 16:01.804
- Come on, boys, let's go out to dinner.
- Out? We can't go out.

16:01.875 --> 16:05.243
We got lots of food right here.
We can't leave the house. Our stuff is here.

16:05.315 --> 16:09.718
Carlton, Geoffrey's away, Mom's gone.
If we don't go out to eat, we'll starve.

16:10.555 --> 16:14.640
Come on, let's celebrate. lt's not
every day that Will does something right.

16:15.315 --> 16:16.760
You know, Luther's a good worker.

16:16.835 --> 16:20.044
Good thing he worked out,
or l'd have to take it out on your hide.

16:20.115 --> 16:22.766
And that would be nasty, wouldn't it?

16:23.315 --> 16:24.965
Come on, boys, let's go.

16:26.315 --> 16:29.319
Will, we got to tell Dad about Luther.
He might be dangerous.

16:29.395 --> 16:32.524
Carlton, please. Look, the man is innocent.

16:33.115 --> 16:34.480
Trust me.

16:40.835 --> 16:43.406
- What happened in here?
- We was robbed!

16:43.795 --> 16:46.605
Oh, my God, what did they take?

16:53.235 --> 16:56.876
I knew it. I told you we shouldn't
have left Luther here.

16:57.875 --> 17:01.357
Luther did this?
Will, Dad is going to kill you.

17:01.435 --> 17:04.325
Me, why? No, he's not.

17:04.395 --> 17:07.160
I mean, first of all, we don't even
know that Luther did this.

17:07.234 --> 17:11.001
And second ofall, Uncle Phil is a fair man,
he can't blame me for none of this.

17:11.075 --> 17:12.884
Will, l'll kill you.

17:13.755 --> 17:16.917
- Uncle Phil, this ain't my fault, man.
- I don't believe this.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.156
"Why don't you
give him a job, Uncle Phil?"

17:19.234 --> 17:21.442
"l got a good feeling
about him, Uncle Phil."

17:21.515 --> 17:23.483
Look, Uncle Phil, l'm telling you...

17:23.555 --> 17:26.637
there's probably a perfectly good
explanation for all of this.

17:26.714 --> 17:27.796
Like what?

17:30.475 --> 17:34.196
Maybe Luther took all our stuff
to get it Scotchgarded.

17:35.915 --> 17:37.917
- It could happen.
- Shut up.

17:37.995 --> 17:41.602
Any idiot could see he's guilty.
l'm calling the police. God!

17:43.155 --> 17:44.919
My Tevin Campbell posters.

17:44.995 --> 17:47.839
If he touched them,
l'll hunt him down like a dog.

17:50.795 --> 17:54.561
All right, wait a minute.
Come on, let's just calm down here.

17:55.395 --> 17:59.366
I mean, come on.
I mean, what did we lose for real?

17:59.715 --> 18:01.877
A bunch of things.

18:02.195 --> 18:03.685
We're all healthy.

18:05.555 --> 18:06.966
We're all safe.

18:10.035 --> 18:12.720
Where are the video games?

18:16.115 --> 18:17.879
I can't breathe.

18:24.395 --> 18:28.241
- Well, he got all the TVs.
- He got the silverware, too.

18:28.635 --> 18:31.844
I feel like such a fool. He was probably
planning this from day one.

18:31.915 --> 18:34.646
Well, don't blame yourself, big guy.
Blame Will.

18:36.035 --> 18:38.481
He should have told you
when Luther stole his baseball.

18:38.555 --> 18:39.795
What baseball?

18:40.595 --> 18:42.199
What baseball?

18:43.635 --> 18:47.242
Well, baseball game where the man with
the stick hit ball and run.

18:47.555 --> 18:48.966
Sort of like this.

18:49.035 --> 18:50.275
Hold it!

18:51.355 --> 18:54.199
You mean to tell me that Luther stole your
Willie Mays...

18:54.275 --> 18:56.004
and you didn't tell me about it?

18:56.075 --> 18:58.203
I didn't really know, Uncle Phil.

18:59.155 --> 19:03.126
Hey, but, if we want to be serious
about this, this is all your fault.

19:03.195 --> 19:04.560
Excuse me?

19:04.635 --> 19:08.879
If you had let rne go to the beach, then
none of this would have never happened.

19:11.115 --> 19:14.597
Will, I will give you till the count of ten
to get out of my sight.

19:14.675 --> 19:15.756
Nine.

19:20.875 --> 19:24.243
Luther get on my nerves, steal my stuff,
and I get in trouble.

19:24.955 --> 19:28.164
I wish that punk was in here right now,
boy, 'cause l'd...

19:29.475 --> 19:33.241
scream like a girl! Uncle Phil!
Luther's in the house.

19:33.315 --> 19:36.637
Yeah, you're right.
Dig me with my bad self, huh?

19:36.715 --> 19:38.205
What the hell are you doing here?

19:38.275 --> 19:40.482
Let me warn you, Luther,
l've called the police.

19:40.555 --> 19:41.795
You've got a lot of damn nerve...

19:41.875 --> 19:43.206
coming back here after you robbed us.

19:43.275 --> 19:46.119
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, please!

19:58.155 --> 20:01.921
Yeah, if this wall weren't in my way,
mister, you'd be plenty sorry.

20:04.395 --> 20:07.239
After we gave you a second chance.
This is how you repay us?

20:07.315 --> 20:11.286
I did not rob you. You got to believe me.
Will, you believe me, right, man?

20:11.355 --> 20:14.120
Hey, you know, it's people like you that
give ex-cons a bad name.

20:14.195 --> 20:16.118
L'm calling the police, man.

20:19.435 --> 20:21.517
Damn, that was fast.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.479
You know, they must have thought
we was white folks.

20:26.675 --> 20:28.564
- Come on in, Officer.
- Thank you.

20:28.635 --> 20:32.606
Thank God you got here when you did.
I was about to turn this sucker out.

20:35.035 --> 20:37.003
Officer, I want you to arrest this man.

20:37.075 --> 20:39.555
He stole my baseball and some other stuff.

20:41.155 --> 20:43.203
- I can't do that, sir.
- Why not?

20:43.275 --> 20:45.482
We already arrested the perpetrator.

20:45.955 --> 20:49.516
Yes, his name is Edward Haskell,
claims to be your law clerk.

20:49.715 --> 20:52.446
Edward! Officer, there must be
some kind of mistake.

20:52.515 --> 20:53.926
L'm afraid not, sir.

20:53.995 --> 20:56.043
Sea, we saw his U-Haul double-parked.

20:56.115 --> 20:58.766
Upon suggesting he move the vehicle,
suspect broke down...

20:58.835 --> 21:00.997
and confessed to cleaning you out, sir.

21:01.075 --> 21:02.918
Why would he want to rob me?

21:03.115 --> 21:06.722
Well, according to him, he's sick and tired
of getting you bagels...

21:06.795 --> 21:09.275
it's not his job to iron your robes...

21:10.115 --> 21:14.677
and he said you unfairly accused him
of calling 1-900-HORNY.

21:17.275 --> 21:19.277
The man is obviously a deviant.

21:21.315 --> 21:23.158
Well, thank you, Officer, and...

21:23.235 --> 21:25.442
l'll meet you down at the station
to make a positive ID.

21:25.515 --> 21:27.244
Very good, thank you, sir.

21:30.555 --> 21:31.761
Luther.

21:37.955 --> 21:40.196
Luther, we're sorry we were wrong.

21:40.475 --> 21:41.840
Tell me about it.

21:42.035 --> 21:43.878
Luther, we're sorry.

21:44.115 --> 21:47.483
Someone in my position should
be a better judge of character.

21:47.555 --> 21:50.126
L'd like for you to continue
to work for us, though.

21:50.715 --> 21:55.596
Well, after working in this house,
jail won't be so bad. See you.

22:00.555 --> 22:03.877
Well, I trust we all have learned
something from this.

22:05.035 --> 22:07.003
Yeah, don't work for you.

22:07.995 --> 22:10.475
Well, we weren't completely wrong
about Luther.

22:10.555 --> 22:13.798
Yes, we were. He didn't touch
my Tevin Campbell posters.

22:15.035 --> 22:17.242
Yeah, but he took Will's baseball.

22:18.555 --> 22:20.796
You mean the one in the plastic case?

22:21.875 --> 22:24.003
I borrowed it for batting practice.

22:24.515 --> 22:27.041
Where is it, Ashley?
That thing is worth a lot of money.

22:27.115 --> 22:29.721
Really, didn't look like it.

22:29.795 --> 22:33.641
Somebody wrote all over it.
But, don't worry, I cleaned it off for you.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.562
Where are those damn
Tevin Campbell posters?

22:38.635 --> 22:39.796
No! No!

22:47.235 --> 22:48.805
You know, man, l'm glad you asked that.

22:48.875 --> 22:52.038
Sea, baseball game where man with stick
hit ball and run.

22:53.675 --> 22:56.918
- Sort of like this.
- Hold it, Will.

23:06.715 --> 23:08.763
<i>- Tlley sin 't noticed. They ain 't noticed.
