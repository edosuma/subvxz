THAT WOULD EVER MAKE ME MARRY

08:40.133 --> 08:41.100
YOU.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.067
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:42.067 --> 08:43.133
>> SO YOU CAN HAVE YOUR LIFE

08:43.133 --> 08:46.000
BACK AND YOUR RING.

08:50.100 --> 08:50.800
>> OH, NO.

08:50.800 --> 08:51.667
YOU EARNED THIS, BITCH.

08:51.667 --> 08:53.300
LET'S GO.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.667
>> * FAST CAR, FAST CAR

08:54.667 --> 08:56.433
* I WANNA BE IN YOUR FAST CAR

08:56.433 --> 08:57.967
* TAKE ME ON A COMET RIDE

08:57.967 --> 08:58.567
* SHOOT ME PAST

08:58.567 --> 08:59.667
* THE FAST STAR

08:59.667 --> 09:01.367
* I WISH I OWNED THAT LAST CAR

09:01.367 --> 09:02.933
* YOU COULD BE THE END TO

09:02.933 --> 09:04.233
* EVERYTHING MY HEART'S

09:04.233 --> 09:05.200
* ASKING FOR

09:12.967 --> 09:14.267
* I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP

09:14.267 --> 09:16.033
* WAKE UP

09:16.033 --> 09:20.467
>> GOOD MORNING, SINGLE LADY.

09:22.633 --> 09:23.967
>> DID I REALLY DO THAT LAST

09:23.967 --> 09:26.367
NIGHT?

09:26.367 --> 09:27.700
DID I REALLY BREAK OFF MY

09:27.700 --> 09:28.933
ENGAGEMENT IN A ROOM FULL OF

09:28.933 --> 09:29.700
PEOPLE?

09:29.700 --> 09:30.767
>> DID VICTOR REALLY SCREW

09:30.767 --> 09:31.933
ANOTHER WOMAN IN YOUR ROOM

09:31.933 --> 09:33.100
DURING YOUR PARTY?

09:33.100 --> 09:35.667
GIRL, YOU GAVE HIM DUST.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.567
AND I WAS SO PROUD.

09:37.567 --> 09:38.867
MM.

09:38.867 --> 09:40.233
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE HE DID THAT.

09:40.233 --> 09:40.900
>> HMM.

09:40.900 --> 09:41.600
>> AND AT THE VERY LEAST I

09:41.600 --> 09:44.667
THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.900
>> CLEAR THIS UP FOR ME, RAQUEL.

09:46.900 --> 09:47.767
LAST NIGHT, YOU WERE ALL, "TO

09:47.767 --> 09:49.200
THE LEFT, TO THE LEFT," AND NOW

09:49.200 --> 09:50.533
YOU ALL, "HEY, NOW, HEY, NOW,

09:50.533 --> 09:52.167
DON'T DREAM IT'S OVER."

09:52.167 --> 09:54.500
AS YOUR FRIEND, PLEASE TELL ME

09:54.500 --> 09:55.867
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO--HUG YOU

09:55.867 --> 09:57.367
OR HIGH-FIVE YOU?

09:57.367 --> 09:58.500
>> I GUESS I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN

09:58.500 --> 09:59.433
HONEST WITH MYSELF.

09:59.433 --> 10:02.167
YEAH, VICTOR BETRAYED ME.

10:02.167 --> 10:04.067
BUT I HAVE TO OWN UP TO MY PART

10:04.067 --> 10:04.967
IN THE CHARADE TOO.

10:04.967 --> 10:06.467
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE, VICTOR WOULD

10:06.467 --> 10:07.933
BE THE WHOLE PACKAGE.

10:07.933 --> 10:11.567
BUT FOR ME, IT WAS LIKE

10:11.567 --> 10:13.567
SLEEPING WITH MY BROTHER.

10:13.567 --> 10:14.267
>> I GET IT.

10:14.267 --> 10:15.400
HE'S FROM A PROMINENT FAMILY.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.667
YOU'RE FROM A PROMINENT FAMILY.

10:16.667 --> 10:17.733
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN MARRY THE

10:17.733 --> 10:19.567
GUY WORKING AT MCDONALD'S.

10:19.567 --> 10:21.667
WELL, MAYBE THE OWNER.

10:21.667 --> 10:23.567
>> BUT WHY?

10:23.567 --> 10:25.533
IF I WAS PASSIONATELY IN LOVE

10:25.533 --> 10:26.533
WITH A MAN AT A FRENCH FRY

10:26.533 --> 10:28.500
STATION, COULDN'T I MARRY HIM?

10:28.500 --> 10:29.367
>> DON'T MAKE ME COME OUT THERE,

10:29.367 --> 10:30.033
RAQUEL.

10:30.033 --> 10:33.567
THAT'S A LONG DROP.

10:33.567 --> 10:34.367
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR

10:34.367 --> 10:36.433
YEARS SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT

10:36.433 --> 10:37.767
WITH YOU TWO.

10:37.767 --> 10:38.933
I COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

10:38.933 --> 10:40.133
I'M JUST GLAD SLEEPING BEAUTY

10:40.133 --> 10:41.433
FINALLY WOKE UP.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.233
>> BUT ISN'T SHE SUPPOSED TO BE

10:42.233 --> 10:44.400
AWAKENED BY A KISS?

10:44.400 --> 10:45.500
NOT BY FINDING HER FIANCE

10:45.500 --> 10:47.267
PLOWING ANOTHER WOMAN.

10:47.267 --> 10:48.200
>> TRADITIONALLY.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.833
BUT THIS WAY WORKED TOO.

10:51.833 --> 10:52.700
>> CATCH ME UP ON WHAT'S GOING

10:52.700 --> 10:53.833
ON WITH YOU, MALCOLM, AND THE

10:53.833 --> 10:54.933
FBI.

10:54.933 --> 10:55.900
>> IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS, AND I

10:55.900 --> 10:57.200
STILL HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.633
FOR ALL I KNOW HE'S SOMEWHERE

10:58.633 --> 11:01.067
CURLED UP WITH HIS EX-WIFE.

11:01.067 --> 11:02.433
I'M PISSED.

11:02.433 --> 11:03.600
I'M HURT. I'M WORRIED.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.867
I'M SCARED.

11:04.867 --> 11:07.033
>> I'M SORRY.

11:18.233 --> 11:18.900
>> THIS LOOKS LIKE A DRUNKEN

11:18.900 --> 11:20.867
THREESOME.

11:20.867 --> 11:23.933
ANYWAY, GUESS WHO I RAN INTO.

11:23.933 --> 11:24.733
>> WHO?

11:24.733 --> 11:25.800
>> REED.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.200
HE WAS A LITTLE SALTY.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.000
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.900
>> WE KISSED ONCE, BUT I JUST

11:30.900 --> 11:32.367
COULDN'T GET INTO HIM.

11:32.367 --> 11:33.533
>> ARE YOU SURE IT'S NOT BECAUSE

11:33.533 --> 11:34.933
YOU BLEW OFF THAT A&R DEAL HE

11:34.933 --> 11:35.867
SET UP FOR YOU?

11:35.867 --> 11:36.833
>> YEAH, OKAY.

11:36.833 --> 11:37.767
MAYBE THAT TOO.

11:37.767 --> 11:39.033
>> I'M JUST GLAD YOU COULD HELP

11:39.033 --> 11:40.000
OUT HERE.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.833
UNTIL VAL COMES BACK FROM HIDING

11:41.833 --> 11:42.800
OUT IN EUROPE, WE'RE REALLY

11:42.800 --> 11:43.667
SHORT-HANDED.

11:43.667 --> 11:44.733
AND, SINCE CHRISTINA GOT

11:44.733 --> 11:45.900
DEPORTED FOR FLUNKING ALL OF HER

11:45.900 --> 11:48.400
CLASSES, I'VE BASICALLY HAD NO

11:48.400 --> 11:49.867
HELP.

11:49.867 --> 11:51.200
VAL IS DEFINITELY NOT IN HER

11:51.200 --> 11:52.267
RIGHT MIND LEAVING YOU IN CHARGE

11:52.267 --> 11:53.167
OVER ME.

11:53.167 --> 11:55.067
>> SHE KNOWS OUR STRENGTHS.

11:55.067 --> 11:56.433
YOU'RE ONLY GOOD AT PLAYING WITH

11:56.433 --> 11:58.200
MANNEQUINS, BUT I MAKE SURE THE

11:58.200 --> 11:59.233
MONEY'S RIGHT.

11:59.233 --> 12:00.800
>> NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.767
THE SHOW IS TOMORROW.

12:01.767 --> 12:03.267
WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO

12:03.267 --> 12:04.333
TELL THE CLUB OWNER?

12:04.333 --> 12:06.433
NO, YOU HAVE A NICE DAY!

12:06.433 --> 12:07.833
>> WAS THAT YOU BEING MEAN?

12:07.833 --> 12:09.733
THAT'S SO CUTE.

12:09.733 --> 12:10.433
>> YOU KNOW WHY THIS IS

12:10.433 --> 12:11.433
HAPPENING, RIGHT?

12:11.433 --> 12:12.767
BECAUSE WES IS BAD-MOUTHING ME.

12:12.767 --> 12:13.933
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S OKAY.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.200
I FEED OFF HATERS.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.633
>> GUYS, I JUST GOT AN EMAIL

12:16.633 --> 12:17.533
FROM VAL.

12:17.533 --> 12:18.733
SHE'S NOT COMING BACK FROM

12:18.733 --> 12:19.767
MILAN.

12:19.767 --> 12:21.233
>> WHAT?

12:21.233 --> 12:22.200
>> WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN "NOT

12:22.200 --> 12:23.267
COMING BACK"?

12:23.267 --> 12:25.300
AS IN NOT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS

12:25.300 --> 12:27.333
LIKE SHE SAID ORIGINALLY OR...

12:27.333 --> 12:28.533
A WEEK OR FOREVER?

12:28.533 --> 12:30.500
>> I JUST GOT HER EMAIL TOO.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.700
IT'S FOREVER.

12:31.700 --> 12:34.100
>> FOREVER EVER?

12:34.100 --> 12:35.433
>> SHE SAYS SHE WANTS NOTHING TO

12:35.433 --> 12:36.333
DO WITH ATLANTA.

12:36.333 --> 12:37.733
SHE CAN'T FACE IT.

12:37.733 --> 12:39.600
>> WOW, SHE'S SERIOUS.

12:39.600 --> 12:42.433
SHE'S GONNA SELL HER BOUTIQUE.

12:42.433 --> 12:44.400
>> WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

12:44.400 --> 12:45.567
CAN I EVEN GET A JOB IN THIS

12:45.567 --> 12:46.867

VAL?

12:48.967 --> 12:50.267
SHE ALWAYS WAS A BITCH.

12:50.267 --> 12:51.400
I HATE HER.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.233
WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?

12:52.233 --> 12:53.533
I LOVE HER, AND I WANT HER BODY

12:53.533 --> 12:55.000
IF I COME BACK AS A WOMAN.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.100

WHY?

13:02.200 --> 13:03.533
OH, GOD!

13:03.533 --> 13:05.267
WHY?

13:05.267 --> 13:07.233
>> HEY, I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO

13:07.233 --> 13:08.267
MAN IT UP REAL FAST.

13:08.267 --> 13:09.333

13:40.300 --> 13:41.800
AND I'M GONNA KEEP PITCHING IT.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.367

16:39.500 --> 16:40.433
NOW SHE'S TWIRLING AROUND LIKE

17:22.767 --> 17:24.300
OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS NO ONE

18:03.867 --> 18:04.867
ME FOR A FOOL.

18:04.867 --> 18:06.100
AND I'M NOBODY'S FOOL.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.700
I NEED ANSWERS.

18:08.700 --> 18:09.467

WITH AN APOLOGY.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.300
I'M SORRY.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.267

18:21.833 --> 18:24.400
BECAUSE THE FBI GAVE ME A WHOLE

NEW PERSPECTIVE ON YOU GUYS'

18:25.433 --> 18:27.000
RELATIONSHIP THAT I FOUND QUITE

>> EVERYTHING THAT I TOLD YOU

18:29.400 --> 18:30.933
WAS TRUE, OKAY?

I'M STILL TAKING CARE OF MY

18:40.467 --> 18:41.767
EX-WIFE?

18:41.767 --> 18:42.433

UNDERSTAND.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
>> I HOPE SO, MALCOLM.

18:52.000 --> 18:52.800
BECAUSE I'M REALLY CONFUSED

18:52.800 --> 18:55.133
ABOUT YOU RIGHT NOW.

18:55.133 --> 18:57.300
>> MAYOR HOWARD HAS BEEN

18:57.300 --> 18:58.967
EXTORTING LOCAL BUSINESSES FOR

18:58.967 --> 19:00.633
YEARS, YEARS.

19:00.633 --> 19:01.967
NOW, ANYBODY WHO STARTED UP A

19:01.967 --> 19:03.000
BUSINESS IN ATLANTA HAD TO PAY

19:03.000 --> 19:06.233
HIM, SO I DID.

19:06.233 --> 19:08.867
BUT THOSE PAYMENTS--THOSE

19:08.867 --> 19:10.933
PAYMENTS WERE ILLEGAL.

19:10.933 --> 19:11.733
AND, IN ORDER TO MAKE A CASE

19:11.733 --> 19:12.767
AGAINST HIM, THEY CAME AFTER

19:12.767 --> 19:14.567
EVERYBODY WHO BRIBED HIM.

19:14.567 --> 19:16.567
>> SO THE FBI CAME AFTER YOU TO

19:16.567 --> 19:17.967
GET TO THE MAYOR?

19:17.967 --> 19:20.967
>> TECHNICALLY ME AND ASHLEE.

19:20.967 --> 19:23.933
SHE USED TO DELIVER THE PAYMENTS

19:23.933 --> 19:25.833
FROM ME TO THE MAYOR'S BOY.

19:25.833 --> 19:26.667
NOW, TWO WEEKS AGO, THAT DUDE

19:26.667 --> 19:27.833
GOT ARRESTED, STARTED NAMING

19:27.833 --> 19:28.667
NAMES.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.933
SO RIGHT NOW, SHE'S ON HER WAY

19:31.933 --> 19:34.067
TO THE IVORY COAST, WHERE SHE

19:34.067 --> 19:36.333
CAN'T BE EXTRADITED OR BOTHER ME

19:36.333 --> 19:37.900
OR US ANYMORE.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.667
>> AND ALL THIS IS OVER?

19:39.667 --> 19:41.033

19:41.033 --> 19:42.767
THAT SHE'S LANDED, SETTLED IN,

19:42.767 --> 19:45.100
MY LAWYERS WILL TALK TO THE FBI

19:45.100 --> 19:48.933
AND CLEAR MY NAME.

19:48.933 --> 19:50.633
BUT, KEISHA, DON'T EVER DOUBT

19:50.633 --> 19:53.667
WHO YOU ARE TO ME.

THE ONLY WOMAN I WANT...

20:00.333 --> 20:02.367

20:29.700 --> 20:32.267

20:53.733 --> 20:54.833
BUT I COULDN'T SELL IT TO HER.

20:54.833 --> 20:56.167
NO WAY SHE WOULD WORK THIS THE

20:56.167 --> 20:58.367
WAY YOU WILL.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.233
PUNISHMENT DIDN'T FIT THE CRIME.

29:40.233 --> 29:41.767
IT WAS ONE TIME WITH ONE CHICK,

29:41.767 --> 29:43.333
AND YOU THREW AWAY SIX YEARS FOR

ONCE.

29:55.500 --> 29:56.433
ONCE.

29:56.433 --> 29:58.033
AND RIGHT OR WRONG, I WAS

29:58.033 --> 30:02.800
PISSED AT YOU FOR ENDING IT.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.767
>> HELL, MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE

30:04.767 --> 30:07.067
GIVEN YOU ANOTHER CHANCE.

30:07.067 --> 30:10.033
WE'D PROBABLY BE MARRIED BY NOW.

30:10.033 --> 30:10.967
WHO'S TO SAY YOU WOULDN'T HAVE

30:10.967 --> 30:13.467

HAVE?

30:16.000 --> 30:17.467
KIM MEANT NOTHING TO ME.

30:17.467 --> 30:19.400
THE ONLY REASON WE SPEAK NOW IS

30:19.400 --> 30:21.167
BECAUSE OF MY SON.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.667
THAT'S WHY I SAY IT WAS PARTLY

30:22.667 --> 30:24.833
WORTH IT.

30:24.833 --> 30:26.200
THAT LITTLE DUDE HAS CHANGED MY

30:26.200 --> 30:27.400
LIFE.

30:27.400 --> 30:28.633
>> YEAH.

30:28.633 --> 30:30.100
I'M GLAD SOME GOOD CAME OUT OF

30:30.100 --> 30:32.633
IT.

30:32.633 --> 30:34.467

30:35.800 --> 30:36.467
>> OKAY.

30:36.467 --> 30:37.800
