Somebody please help!

00:59.153 --> 00:59.786
Fuck.

01:03.190 --> 01:04.158
What do you want?

01:04.258 --> 01:04.860
Who are you?

01:05.226 --> 01:05.993
What do you need?

01:06.227 --> 01:07.194
I have money.

01:07.395 --> 01:08.996
What the fuck do you need?

01:09.163 --> 01:10.399
Jesus Christ.

01:10.531 --> 01:11.165
Say something.

01:11.499 --> 01:12.133
Who are you?

01:29.419 --> 01:31.586
Just-- Jesus Christ.

01:31.753 --> 01:33.488
Please, please,
what do you need?

01:33.689 --> 01:37.393
You can have anything you want.

01:37.592 --> 01:39.696
I told you not to fuck me.

01:39.762 --> 01:41.564
And you fucked me.

01:41.698 --> 01:42.498
This is what happens.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.335
What the fuck.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.369
I didn't mean to fuck you.

01:45.468 --> 01:46.102
I still have it.

01:46.669 --> 01:47.804
You can have it all back.

01:48.005 --> 01:48.805
I swear to God.

01:49.006 --> 01:51.342
I have already paid no one here.

01:51.541 --> 01:53.243
He never misses his mark.

01:53.344 --> 01:54.278
Ever.

01:54.678 --> 01:56.180
You shouldn't have fucked me.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.047
Fuck.

01:57.449 --> 01:58.248
Please, I'll give you anything.

01:58.649 --> 01:59.750
You can have anything you want.

01:59.850 --> 02:00.985
I still have the money.

02:01.319 --> 02:01.986
It's all fucking yours.

02:02.187 --> 02:02.853
Please.

02:03.121 --> 02:03.922
No, please.

02:05.290 --> 02:06.057
Fuck.

02:08.226 --> 02:08.961
God.

02:09.094 --> 02:10.228
Fuck.

02:11.964 --> 02:12.764
Please.

02:12.965 --> 02:14.099
Please.

02:14.265 --> 02:15.033
Please.

02:19.238 --> 02:19.838
Fuck.

02:25.111 --> 02:26.112
Fuck.

02:30.216 --> 02:30.984
Help!

02:33.052 --> 02:35.054
Please.

02:35.155 --> 02:35.922
Fuck.

02:40.427 --> 02:40.995
Help.

02:41.228 --> 02:42.195
Help.

02:42.262 --> 02:43.030
Help.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.165
Please.

02:45.332 --> 02:48.268
Somebody help.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.371
Fu-- Pl--

02:50.438 --> 02:51.339
Fuck.

02:59.247 --> 03:00.015
Help.

03:17.132 --> 03:20.870
KFYS
95.3 This news cast

03:21.070 --> 03:23.273
is brought to you
by Diablo used cars.

03:23.406 --> 03:26.309
Diablo used cars, deals
you give yourself more.

03:26.409 --> 03:27.709
Off I-25 north of--

03:28.111 --> 03:30.047
Tensions rising with
the perceived abuse

03:30.146 --> 03:33.450
of power from Senator Kelly
to have his son given a bail

03:33.650 --> 03:36.086
release after--

05:15.959 --> 05:17.460
You guys are so fucked.

05:44.255 --> 05:45.457
Let him go.

05:45.557 --> 05:46.391
Shoot him.

05:46.692 --> 05:47.626
Did you fucking hear me?

05:47.693 --> 05:49.528
I said let him go.

05:49.661 --> 05:50.795
Don't fuck me right now.

05:51.463 --> 05:54.200
I swear to God I will paint this
entire fucking backyard red.

05:54.366 --> 05:55.168
I swear don't--

06:18.492 --> 06:19.593
Help me.

06:19.693 --> 06:21.562
Help me.

06:21.662 --> 06:23.430
Help please.

06:23.597 --> 06:25.366
Help me please.

06:25.566 --> 06:27.334
Oh my God.

06:27.401 --> 06:30.271
Please help me.

06:30.337 --> 06:30.905
Oh.

06:31.139 --> 06:32.641
Hello?

06:32.806 --> 06:33.508
Help.

06:33.774 --> 06:34.442
Help me please.

06:35.776 --> 06:38.346
Please help me.

06:38.513 --> 06:40.249
Hello?

06:40.348 --> 06:40.781
Help.

10:51.515 --> 10:52.583
Alder Hotel.

10:52.716 --> 10:53.350
We need a room.

11:41.335 --> 11:43.905
Checking in?

11:43.972 --> 11:45.172
Until we check out.

11:45.540 --> 11:47.107
I couldn't get you
the room with a view.

11:47.275 --> 11:47.976
That's OK.

11:48.443 --> 11:50.211
I'm here for the room service.

11:50.411 --> 11:52.380
You have the room for four days.

11:55.416 --> 11:57.785
Here's a map of the building
in case you all get lost.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.755
You're on the 16th
floor, 18th room.

12:03.058 --> 12:06.028
Be sure to call the desk if the
neighbors are being too loud

12:06.128 --> 12:07.862
or if you need any assistance.

12:07.930 --> 12:08.897
We are here to help you.

12:09.065 --> 12:10.432
Enjoy your stay.

13:11.964 --> 13:14.168
She's-- Fuck.

13:14.267 --> 13:14.968
Guys.

13:15.234 --> 13:16.803
Wait, wait.

13:16.970 --> 13:17.870
Jamie, come here.

13:17.971 --> 13:18.538
Hey.

13:18.738 --> 13:19.305
Hey.

13:22.476 --> 13:23.276
Come on, take it down.

13:26.846 --> 13:28.549
Come on.

13:28.748 --> 13:29.650
Let's go.

13:29.749 --> 13:30.717
Ah Fuck.

14:04.087 --> 14:05.088
Come on.

14:26.744 --> 14:27.612
I need the key.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.066
Don't shoot.

15:50.199 --> 15:50.967
Who the fuck are you?

15:51.367 --> 15:52.001
Get your ass out here right now.

15:52.535 --> 15:53.203
I'll kill you right now.

15:53.636 --> 15:54.271
I don't fucking care.

15:54.670 --> 15:55.605
You got five seconds.

15:56.173 --> 15:59.243
5, 4, 3-- I'm a
crazy psycho bitch.

15:59.309 --> 16:00.143
Don't try me-- 2.

16:00.244 --> 16:01.044
Out.

16:01.245 --> 16:01.878
You want to try me today?

16:02.012 --> 16:02.613
No.

16:02.813 --> 16:03.180
Let's go.

16:03.479 --> 16:04.114
Let's go.

16:04.380 --> 16:04.982
Pick up the speed.

16:05.115 --> 16:05.616
OK.

16:05.916 --> 16:06.850
Now, who the fuck are you?

16:07.084 --> 16:07.751
I'm the doctor.

16:08.151 --> 16:08.719
Who the fuck are you?

16:08.952 --> 16:09.354
I'm the--

16:09.753 --> 16:10.387
On your fucking knees.

16:10.554 --> 16:11.189
I'm--

16:11.555 --> 16:12.223
On your knees now.

16:12.456 --> 16:13.057
I'm getting down.

16:13.258 --> 16:13.858
Go.

16:14.225 --> 16:14.959
I'm getting down.

16:15.226 --> 16:15.927
Search him.

16:16.194 --> 16:18.296
I'm getting down.

16:24.236 --> 16:25.237
He's clean.

16:25.436 --> 16:26.704
I told you I'm the doctor.

16:26.838 --> 16:28.173
I'm here to help you.

16:33.679 --> 16:36.749
You look like you could use one.

16:36.849 --> 16:39.352
Let's get her upstairs.

16:39.551 --> 16:40.920
OK, come on.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.222
Thanks, Joe

16:42.322 --> 16:43.055
All right, Lee what do you need?

16:43.290 --> 16:43.956
Painkillers.

16:44.224 --> 16:45.158
Painkillers.

16:45.457 --> 16:46.092
Hey, hey, do you
have painkillers?

16:46.259 --> 16:47.227
Yeah.

16:47.794 --> 16:48.395
In my bag downstairs
there are opioids.

16:48.527 --> 16:49.195
All right.

16:49.428 --> 16:50.330
All right.

16:50.597 --> 16:51.298
And then grab a glass of water.

16:51.530 --> 16:52.499
Jamie, come here.

16:52.699 --> 16:53.733
I need you to pay Craig, OK?

16:54.134 --> 16:55.702
We can't have any
loose ends, at least

16:55.902 --> 16:57.604
not till we can get
out of the country.

16:57.704 --> 16:58.705
Which is when Lee?

16:59.039 --> 17:00.207
It's going to be
at least 40 days.

17:00.341 --> 17:00.975
Could be longer.

17:01.275 --> 17:01.943
I don't know.

17:02.343 --> 17:04.245
The clerk said four.

17:04.312 --> 17:06.881
Its code it's tense, so
it's going to be at least

17:07.048 --> 17:08.416
be 40 days.

17:08.616 --> 17:09.884
This place is
completely off the grid.

17:09.984 --> 17:11.420
It's not attached to any of us.

17:11.619 --> 17:13.322
So we have to stay
here for a while.

17:13.521 --> 17:14.389
We can't talk to anybody.

17:14.488 --> 17:15.123
I know.

17:15.324 --> 17:16.124
OK.

17:16.457 --> 17:17.426
This is going to hurt--

17:17.625 --> 17:19.161
Please go pay Craig.

17:19.261 --> 17:20.195
Fine.

17:20.796 --> 17:22.197
You need to look at
me directly please

17:22.731 --> 17:24.900
if you can keep your
eyes open a little bit.

17:32.607 --> 17:33.909
OK, I found them.

17:34.110 --> 17:35.477
You definitely
have a concussion.

17:35.544 --> 17:36.980
Yeah, I know shit.

17:42.453 --> 17:44.421
You need to get some sleep.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.655
No.

17:46.055 --> 17:46.856
Hey, I thought she
couldn't sleep if--

17:47.090 --> 17:48.057
That's a myth.

17:48.459 --> 17:50.227
Are you a real fucking doctor?

17:50.327 --> 17:50.894
I was.

17:50.962 --> 17:51.328
Just--

17:51.661 --> 17:52.296
As much as--

17:52.695 --> 17:53.629
--get some rest.

17:53.897 --> 17:54.497
--makes my head feel better.

17:54.732 --> 17:55.531
Thank you.

17:55.934 --> 17:57.501
Can you go check up Jamie?

18:03.274 --> 18:04.342
OK.

18:04.943 --> 18:07.245
I'll be back to check
up on her later.

18:07.345 --> 18:12.217
And I'll call one of the
phones that management gave her

18:12.417 --> 18:13.651
before you do.

18:17.822 --> 18:23.062
Oh, and word of advice.

18:23.195 --> 18:25.164
Follow the rules here.

18:25.364 --> 18:28.134
It'll keep you safe.

18:28.300 --> 18:28.935
Yeah, I'm out of here too.

18:29.135 --> 18:29.735
No way.

18:30.069 --> 18:31.203
You're staying.

18:31.637 --> 18:33.639
You can have the second half of
this when we ship out of here.

18:33.806 --> 18:35.041
Which is when exactly?

18:35.175 --> 18:35.942
Yes, second that.

18:36.143 --> 18:37.344
She said 40 days.

18:37.511 --> 18:38.111
40 days.

18:38.512 --> 18:40.213
It could be longer.

18:40.313 --> 18:41.680
You're joking.

18:41.848 --> 18:43.549
I'm not staying here 40 days.

18:43.616 --> 18:44.818
Could be longer.

18:47.287 --> 18:49.156
Fine.

18:49.289 --> 18:50.090
What room do I get?

18:54.963 --> 18:57.165
Guess I'll take
the fucking couch.

20:14.347 --> 20:19.385
I have complete control
of your environment.

21:58.423 --> 21:59.458
Channel 19.

22:05.864 --> 22:06.966
I was watching that.

22:07.300 --> 22:08.401
It'll be there when we're done.

22:10.104 --> 22:11.803
And early this morning,
local authorities

22:11.870 --> 22:14.807
found the body of the son of
Colorado Senator Gallagher

22:15.009 --> 22:16.809
Kelly, an alleged
murderer, Ronan

22:16.977 --> 22:18.545
Kelly, in a lake near his home.

22:18.746 --> 22:20.714
First believed by protesters
to have flood bail

22:20.847 --> 22:21.982
early last night.

22:22.516 --> 22:24.817
Kelly is now the victim
of his own murder case.

22:24.985 --> 22:26.320
Local authorities
are now looking

22:26.587 --> 22:29.958
for these two suspects,
Jolene and Andrea Holt,

22:30.158 --> 22:32.661
sisters who have a close
connection to the Kelly murder

22:32.727 --> 22:34.461
case.

22:34.629 --> 22:36.197
Looks like we're on the clear.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.967
Authorities are also looking
for a third sister, Jamie Holt,

22:39.134 --> 22:40.302
for questioning.

22:40.702 --> 22:43.205
They're unsure if she
was involved or not.

22:43.272 --> 22:45.607
Local authorities urge if
you have any information

22:45.807 --> 22:47.809
on the whereabouts of
these three individuals,

22:47.977 --> 22:49.645
call 9-1-1 immediately.

22:49.745 --> 22:50.879
Do not approach them.

22:51.514 --> 22:54.250
They are considered to be
armed and extremely dangerous.

22:54.450 --> 22:58.121
Senator Kelly had this to
say in a statement today.

22:58.188 --> 23:00.623
This egregious and vicious
attack on my family

23:00.756 --> 23:02.159
speaks volumes.

23:02.491 --> 23:06.763
In this country, you're
innocent until proven guilty.

23:06.829 --> 23:12.703
This so-called victim did not
give my son that opportunity.

23:12.902 --> 23:16.373
Instead, they elected to dish
out their own brand of justice

23:16.506 --> 23:21.545
for a crime of which he was
quite obviously innocent.

23:21.746 --> 23:26.584
No one leaves this house
under any circumstance.

23:26.651 --> 23:29.587
You leave, you die.

23:29.787 --> 23:30.588
Understand?

24:25.881 --> 24:26.782
Hey.

24:28.283 --> 24:29.451
Where have you been?

24:31.354 --> 24:35.158
Listen, I told you it was going
to be like this for a few days.

24:35.358 --> 24:38.861
You can't even come
out here for me?

24:39.061 --> 24:40.963
I really can't.

24:41.097 --> 24:43.733
OK.

24:43.833 --> 24:46.135
I just need something.

24:46.335 --> 24:51.808
I told you it's just going
to be like this for a while.

24:51.874 --> 24:54.610
Listen, can you do me a favor?

24:54.777 --> 24:55.813
Yeah, what's that?

24:56.013 --> 24:59.116
Just lay low for a few days, OK?

24:59.283 --> 25:01.852
Just hang out, lay low,
keep it to yourself.

25:02.052 --> 25:02.920
That's all you got to do.

25:03.020 --> 25:04.721
Just do it.

25:04.788 --> 25:06.557
Lay low?

25:06.723 --> 25:07.458
What?

25:07.724 --> 25:08.725
Exactly what I said.

25:08.926 --> 25:09.994
And I mean it.

25:10.094 --> 25:10.727
All right.

25:10.895 --> 25:11.728
Yeah.

25:11.863 --> 25:12.596
OK.

25:12.831 --> 25:15.667
I'll lay low.

25:15.800 --> 25:16.467
OK.

25:16.601 --> 25:17.402
Bye.

25:17.535 --> 25:18.136
Bye.

25:52.038 --> 25:54.841
Walking down the hall.

25:55.041 --> 25:56.810
Walking down the hall.

25:57.010 --> 25:58.645
Tripping and she fell.

25:58.778 --> 26:00.081
Tripping and she fell.

26:00.547 --> 26:04.652
The remnants from her lunchbox
splat against the wall.

26:08.689 --> 26:10.758
She don't belong.

26:10.959 --> 26:12.059
She don't belong.

26:12.194 --> 26:16.164
She don't belong in here.

26:21.837 --> 26:24.339
People gather round.

26:24.474 --> 26:26.009
People gather round.

26:26.074 --> 26:27.410
Prostrate on the ground.

26:27.543 --> 26:29.044
Prostrate on the ground.

26:29.611 --> 26:33.582
The laughter of her classmates
never cease to bring her down.

27:05.649 --> 27:09.621
Whoa, whoa.

27:09.821 --> 27:10.822
Whoa, whoa.

27:13.559 --> 27:17.729
Whoa, whoa.

27:17.862 --> 27:19.831
Whoa, whoa.

27:29.709 --> 27:37.650
Early in the morning
rise to face the day.

27:37.717 --> 27:41.621
Jamie's got a gun she's
going to blow them all away.

27:45.692 --> 27:47.728
She don't belong.

27:47.928 --> 27:49.597
She don't belong.

27:49.663 --> 27:53.601
She don't belong in here.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.937
She don't belong.

27:56.137 --> 27:57.839
She don't belong.

27:57.905 --> 28:00.609
She don't belong in here.

28:56.201 --> 28:57.070
No, we were--

28:57.269 --> 28:57.835
No, I--

29:00.372 --> 29:02.874
Take your hands off of me, dude.

29:03.076 --> 29:04.476
You're such a bitch.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.083
Malcolm.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.151
Senator Kelly.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.685
No need for money.

29:15.055 --> 29:16.789
How are you holding up?

29:16.856 --> 29:18.591
I'm fine.

29:18.791 --> 29:21.562
It's going to take some time.

29:25.132 --> 29:26.899
Cops find anything?

29:27.034 --> 29:27.634
No.

29:30.071 --> 29:33.108
Did you find him?

30:10.614 --> 30:13.016
You didn't show the police this?

30:13.150 --> 30:15.051
No.

30:15.185 --> 30:16.653
This could help them find them.

30:16.886 --> 30:18.355
You know that.

30:18.455 --> 30:20.957
I don't want the
cops to find them.

30:21.025 --> 30:23.794
We both know who
wanted to do it.

30:23.960 --> 30:27.864
I don't want the
cops to find them.

30:27.931 --> 30:28.865
I want him to.

31:09.943 --> 31:13.346
Sir, listen to me.

31:13.413 --> 31:16.349
It wasn't easy, OK?

31:16.550 --> 31:17.951
This guy is no joke.

31:20.187 --> 31:22.723
He's evil.

31:22.856 --> 31:24.458
Pure evil.

31:24.658 --> 31:26.594
His cure records
are off the charts.

31:26.760 --> 31:30.131
I can't tell you what I had
to go through to find him.

31:30.298 --> 31:32.867
After my shit, I never
wanted to see him again.

31:46.082 --> 31:50.253
You don't know what
you're asking for here.

31:50.319 --> 31:52.655
You haven't heard the stories.

31:52.722 --> 31:58.028
After I used him, I
never felt the same.

31:58.195 --> 32:00.764
Something was just wrong.

32:02.633 --> 32:08.373
Look, sir, they say
he can't be killed.

32:08.572 --> 32:11.441
They say he's barely human.

32:11.575 --> 32:13.910
They say he's the grim reaper.

32:14.078 --> 32:15.445
Good.

32:15.646 --> 32:17.849
I want the grim reaper.

32:17.982 --> 32:18.383
Easy.

32:18.582 --> 32:19.217
OK?

32:19.584 --> 32:21.986
My son, Mr. Isaac.

32:22.153 --> 32:25.224
He killed my son.

32:25.324 --> 32:27.226
OK.

32:27.425 --> 32:30.062
Rule one.

32:30.195 --> 32:32.164
He is no one.

32:32.331 --> 32:34.900
Got it?

32:35.067 --> 32:36.035
No one.

32:39.104 --> 32:40.572
Open the glove box.

32:50.582 --> 32:52.319
He's in there.

32:52.385 --> 32:54.688
Caught out about a week ago.

32:54.888 --> 32:57.657
He's out on bail
waiting for the trial.

32:57.857 --> 32:59.393
That's the senator's house.

32:59.592 --> 33:03.064
His dad would be a
fucking politician.

33:03.130 --> 33:05.333
Wouldn't be that
heavily guarded?

33:05.498 --> 33:08.436
It's nothing that
we couldn't handle.

33:08.636 --> 33:10.104
So you want to kill him?

33:10.237 --> 33:11.038
No.

33:11.205 --> 33:12.773
I wasn't there.

33:12.973 --> 33:16.445
I hate what he did
to you and her.

33:16.510 --> 33:20.415
But this is up to you.

33:20.614 --> 33:22.550
So you want me to kill him?

33:22.650 --> 33:25.287
And we're going to
do what exactly?

33:25.354 --> 33:26.621
I have a plan.

33:26.955 --> 33:29.491
So we just leave our
fucking entire lives?

33:29.658 --> 33:31.526
Just exit stage left?

33:31.593 --> 33:34.563
What does family
mean to you, hmm?

33:34.763 --> 33:37.433
We are all that we have, OK?

33:37.532 --> 33:39.869
Mom's gone, dad's gone now too.

33:40.036 --> 33:42.805
Family is something,
but it's not everything.

33:43.006 --> 33:45.541
Do you have anything else in
your life to leave behind?

33:45.742 --> 33:47.176
Nothing you're
concerned at all about?

33:47.344 --> 33:49.712
Just walking away
from for something

33:49.846 --> 33:51.248
that happened years ago?

33:51.482 --> 33:55.987
Right now I'm concerned
about our younger sister.

33:56.120 --> 33:56.920
Jolene--

33:57.321 --> 33:58.288
Don't fucking call me that!

33:58.489 --> 34:00.190
Oh, OK.

34:00.290 --> 34:02.259
You can't do this, but--

34:02.427 --> 34:03.127
She can.

34:03.395 --> 34:04.496
I've got a plan.

34:04.561 --> 34:06.663
So it's up to her.

34:06.797 --> 34:08.166
Of course.

34:54.815 --> 34:57.185
Have complete control
of your environment.

35:31.620 --> 35:34.691
Didn't you already
watched that one?

35:34.891 --> 35:38.028
I have exhausted every
movie that I actually

35:38.194 --> 35:40.297
want to watch is on that shelf.

35:40.431 --> 35:42.566
Maybe if your sister would
let us use the internet.

35:42.732 --> 35:43.733
I don't fucking control that.

35:43.867 --> 35:45.336
No, I know.

35:45.735 --> 35:48.439
Eventually, I'll get bored of
rewatching the ones I've seen,

35:48.606 --> 35:49.974
and then I'll try
the ones I have.

35:50.174 --> 35:53.578
And maybe I'll give
you a chance to try.

35:53.711 --> 35:54.912
Has she gotten up yet?

35:55.080 --> 35:56.314
I haven't seen her.

35:56.680 --> 35:57.681
Heard the toilet
flush a while ago,

35:57.848 --> 35:58.782
but I'm not sure who it was.

35:58.849 --> 35:59.584
What time?

35:59.884 --> 36:01.020
You mean what time?

36:01.386 --> 36:03.654
What time did you
hear the toilet flush?

36:03.721 --> 36:05.024
I don't pay attention.

36:05.124 --> 36:06.092
Roughly?

36:06.491 --> 36:07.994
Roughly, I don't fucking know.

36:08.094 --> 36:09.661
You can be useless.

36:09.828 --> 36:11.397
Oh yeah, good
morning to you too.

37:18.501 --> 37:21.271
I'll
keep it for myself.

37:23.940 --> 37:25.408
Channel 237.

37:25.575 --> 37:27.178
KFYS 95.3.

37:27.310 --> 37:27.944
The Ghost.

37:28.345 --> 37:30.514
Colorado's home for pop music.

37:30.648 --> 37:31.982
We got your news coming up.

37:32.516 --> 37:36.554
And after the break, I've got
your daily crazy 9-1-1 stories.

37:36.753 --> 37:39.624
An addict woman blames a
bear for an obvious murder

37:39.724 --> 37:40.691
of her boyfriend.

37:41.292 --> 37:43.327
And the man calls
the cops on himself

37:43.461 --> 37:45.163
for growing weed
in his basement.

37:45.230 --> 37:46.999
Reminder, we are in Colo--

37:47.199 --> 37:51.036
This may be the perfect
time to refinance your home.

37:51.136 --> 37:52.271
It may seem daunt--

37:52.671 --> 37:54.740
More protests today
demanding the removal

37:54.872 --> 37:58.744
of Senator Gallagher Kelly for
an abuse of power as a governor

37:58.944 --> 38:01.313
has sent in our
National Guard to help.

38:01.513 --> 38:05.817
Senator Kelly stated he had no
intentions of stepping down.

38:06.019 --> 38:07.786
The manhunt continues
for the suspected

38:07.853 --> 38:09.223
murderers of
Senator Kelly's son,

38:09.355 --> 38:10.956
but authorities have no leads.

38:11.357 --> 38:14.661
They encourage citizens to call
if you have any information.

38:32.446 --> 38:34.948
You know there's supposed
to be meat in that, right?

38:35.083 --> 38:37.351
Yeah, there wasn't any in there.

38:37.485 --> 38:39.454
Yeah, I could have
sworn I saw some.

38:42.191 --> 38:43.558
Don't want to tell you.

38:43.758 --> 38:45.660
Oh, well, that's going to suck.

38:45.826 --> 38:46.761
Yeah.

38:47.229 --> 38:49.564
This place is
fucking disgusting.

38:49.665 --> 38:50.766
Job, Tell me about it.

38:51.167 --> 38:53.902
Did you see the
watermelon in the fridge?

38:53.968 --> 38:55.004
Watermelon?

38:55.471 --> 38:56.871
Yeah, there's a
watermelon in there.

38:57.240 --> 38:59.575
I don't even know how
fucking old it is.

38:59.675 --> 39:00.710
Throw it away, Jolene.

39:00.842 --> 39:01.677
I don't want to touch it.

39:02.012 --> 39:03.579
What if it falls apart?

39:05.548 --> 39:07.084
Jolene, I don't have time to
deal with that bullshit either.

39:07.284 --> 39:09.619
Let me go to the shower.

42:18.887 --> 42:20.588
I got you good, didn't I?

42:27.663 --> 42:28.730
You OK?

42:44.481 --> 42:46.616
Hello?

42:46.716 --> 42:49.253
Babe,
are you there?

42:52.689 --> 42:54.158
Babe?

42:54.358 --> 42:55.826
I've been in here
a really long time.

42:57.895 --> 42:58.696
Got to go.

43:01.333 --> 43:02.600
I love you.

43:07.305 --> 43:10.442
I'll see you later, I guess.

43:34.867 --> 43:37.537
Good morning.

43:37.737 --> 43:38.671
Morning.

43:38.771 --> 43:40.874
You're up early.

43:41.075 --> 43:43.010
I just couldn't sleep.

43:43.077 --> 43:44.244
No?

43:44.444 --> 43:47.548
No, I was thinking too much.

43:47.748 --> 43:49.716
What about?

43:49.916 --> 43:53.554
Well, I just feel
really bad you being

43:53.654 --> 43:58.559
down here all by yourself.

43:58.760 --> 43:59.761
Not so?

43:59.894 --> 44:00.695
Yeah.

44:48.080 --> 44:50.715
You can sleep.

44:55.153 --> 44:56.054
You can sleep.

46:59.017 --> 47:01.087
Babe?

47:01.154 --> 47:03.623
Babe, you there?

47:03.690 --> 47:09.362
Is this some
kind of fucking joke?

47:09.529 --> 47:12.365
It's really not fucking funny.

47:12.498 --> 47:14.367
You don't know what
I'm going through

47:14.434 --> 47:17.304
and I've just missed you.

47:17.403 --> 47:19.607
Gone really fucking bad here.

47:22.344 --> 47:23.910
Come the fuck on.

47:26.314 --> 47:28.682
Call you later, I guess.

49:28.310 --> 49:30.045
Joe, are you OK?

49:30.112 --> 49:32.080
Yeah, I just slipped and fell.

49:32.248 --> 49:33.182
I'm fine.

49:33.282 --> 49:34.417
OK, you be careful.

49:34.783 --> 49:36.386
We don't need two
Lee's around here.

50:02.380 --> 50:04.615
What the fuck is this?

50:04.815 --> 50:06.518
Keep your fucking voice down.

50:06.583 --> 50:09.120
No, you have made us so fucked.

50:09.254 --> 50:10.221
OK, well, newsflash.

50:10.721 --> 50:12.023
I've been using it
since I got here,

50:12.123 --> 50:13.658
so clearly not looking for us.

50:13.725 --> 50:14.826
Oh, no, they are looking for us.

50:15.060 --> 50:16.261
And when they find
us, it's going

50:16.461 --> 50:17.496
to be because of shit like that.

50:18.029 --> 50:20.332
Because you are using
shit like that and

50:20.533 --> 50:23.202
we're not fucking supposed to.

50:24.636 --> 50:27.339
That's it.

50:27.406 --> 50:29.175
What?

50:29.341 --> 50:30.543
Are you fucking leaving?

50:30.743 --> 50:32.111
I sure I am leaving.

50:32.311 --> 50:33.579
Where the fuck do you
think you're going?

50:33.679 --> 50:34.514
I don't know.

50:35.147 --> 50:36.516
Do you think you're
going to stop me?

50:36.916 --> 50:38.151
Well, Lee said we can't
leave the safe house

50:38.617 --> 50:39.785
because this is where
they're not going to find us.

50:39.985 --> 50:40.953
This is where we're safe.

50:41.354 --> 50:42.289
You can't fucking leave.

50:42.355 --> 50:44.891
Fuck Lee.

50:45.658 --> 50:47.227
Fuck you.

50:47.427 --> 50:49.863
You're being so fucking selfish.

50:49.996 --> 50:51.965
You can just tell me.

50:52.132 --> 50:56.370
You know this is not
just all about you?

50:57.804 --> 50:58.406
Fine.

50:58.638 --> 50:59.207
Fuck.

50:59.606 --> 51:00.308
Fucking go then.

52:30.337 --> 52:32.105
Babe, open the door.

52:33.507 --> 52:34.608
No, motherfucker.

52:35.008 --> 52:36.177
After everything
we've been through?

52:36.776 --> 52:39.379
You can't even break up to
me face to fucking face?

52:47.522 --> 52:49.990
You've no idea what
I've been through.

52:50.159 --> 52:53.328
When you fucking regret
this, don't call me.

53:39.043 --> 53:42.180
Young man
wake in the morning.

53:45.684 --> 53:49.121
Cannot find his way back home.

53:51.789 --> 53:54.393
Woman cries in the evening.

53:57.763 --> 54:00.166
Hides the love inside.

54:03.802 --> 54:07.373
Two but they can't be alone.

54:09.875 --> 54:13.213
Back and forth they both can go.

54:16.150 --> 54:19.153
Back and forth they both grow.

55:36.835 --> 55:39.371
Are you fucking high?

55:39.504 --> 55:40.572
No.

55:40.672 --> 55:42.039
Are you?

55:42.107 --> 55:42.907
Asshole.

55:56.955 --> 55:58.191
Shut up.

55:58.324 --> 55:59.559
Knew you'd be back.

56:01.927 --> 56:02.796
Fuck you.

56:26.388 --> 56:27.756
Lee?

56:27.955 --> 56:28.690
Good morning, Sunshine.

56:28.824 --> 56:30.725
Whoa, OK.

56:30.926 --> 56:32.494
Blueberry pancakes.

56:32.694 --> 56:34.463
What are you--

56:34.663 --> 56:35.398
I know.

56:35.464 --> 56:36.798
No syrup.

56:36.997 --> 56:37.965
I like it better that way.

56:38.167 --> 56:39.734
But what are you doing?

56:39.936 --> 56:42.604
You look-- are you
feeling better?

56:42.704 --> 56:45.540
Much better.

56:45.641 --> 56:46.809
OK.

56:47.008 --> 56:47.610
Eat up.

56:51.113 --> 56:53.250
Thank you.

56:53.317 --> 56:56.320
I didn't see any tea in
breakfast of doing surgery.

56:56.453 --> 56:57.019
Did you--

56:57.421 --> 56:58.388
You have to look harder.

57:16.941 --> 57:18.041
Police!

57:19.744 --> 57:20.578
Runner.

57:20.678 --> 57:21.513
Runner!

57:21.913 --> 57:22.614
Back to basics.

57:22.881 --> 57:23.482
Back to letters.

57:24.849 --> 57:25.617
Back to square one.

57:25.884 --> 57:26.784
Back to reality.

57:26.851 --> 57:27.852
Back to basics.

57:28.052 --> 57:28.753
Back to letters Back to

57:28.853 --> 57:29.488
Hands up!

57:29.721 --> 57:30.456
Hands up!

57:30.622 --> 57:31.323
Against the wall!

57:31.589 --> 57:32.124
Against the wall!

57:32.324 --> 57:32.892
Against the wall!

57:34.426 --> 57:35.294
Back to square one.

57:35.628 --> 57:35.995
Back to reality.

57:36.328 --> 57:37.396
Back to basics.

57:37.796 --> 57:38.831
Back to letters
Back to square one.

57:39.063 --> 57:40.599
Back to square one.

59:06.092 --> 59:07.658
What are you doing?

59:07.758 --> 59:08.659
Looking.

59:08.927 --> 59:09.561
I saw somebody out there, Jamie.

59:09.894 --> 59:13.064
I saw somebody.

59:13.198 --> 59:13.932
You are paranoid.

59:14.265 --> 59:15.300
No, I'm not paranoid.

59:15.834 --> 59:17.536
There was somebody
standing on the sidewalk

59:17.669 --> 59:18.770
and they were watching me.

59:19.070 --> 59:20.005
I saw-- I fucking
saw them, Jamie.

59:20.206 --> 59:20.839
Let's go tell Lee then.

59:20.972 --> 59:21.906
No.

59:22.274 --> 59:22.975
No, we don't need to tell Lee.

59:23.242 --> 59:24.043
She's going to--

59:24.443 --> 59:25.611
She will fucking lose it, right?

59:26.012 --> 59:26.879
And then maybe we can leave.

59:26.979 --> 59:27.947
No, I did--

59:28.547 --> 59:30.449
I don't want to tell
Lee because I wanted

59:30.517 --> 59:32.051
to talk to you about this
first before she freaks out

59:32.151 --> 59:32.718
about this.

59:33.120 --> 59:33.886
So do what?

59:34.321 --> 59:35.655
I didn't fucking see anything.

59:36.022 --> 59:37.257
No, maybe you didn't, but
I sure as fuck saw them.

59:37.391 --> 59:38.458
They were standing there.

59:38.758 --> 59:40.128
What are you going
to do about him?

59:40.594 --> 59:42.529
What do you mean what am
I going to do about it?

59:42.695 --> 59:44.297
Well, figure out what
are you want to do.

59:44.464 --> 59:45.866
You are the shot-caller
around here.

59:45.999 --> 59:47.135
I don't call the shots.

59:47.635 --> 59:49.537
But do you think if you
didn't we would be here?

59:49.604 --> 59:51.406
Well, I would say woke up on
the wrong side of the bed,

59:51.705 --> 59:53.807
but there is no right side
of the fucking floor, Jamie.

59:53.874 --> 59:55.610
I'm saying that this is
more than an inconvenience.

59:55.709 --> 59:56.344
Oh, I'm sorry.

59:56.944 --> 59:58.246
Is being here
inconvenient for you?

59:58.546 --> 59:59.480
Is that your fucking
problem with me?

59:59.614 --> 1:00:00.616
That's an understatement.

1:00:00.815 --> 1:00:01.215
Inconvenient?

1:00:01.416 --> 1:00:02.117
Truth--

1:00:02.584 --> 1:00:03.785
You think this is inconvenient?

1:00:04.218 --> 1:00:05.521
You don't even know what
the fuck happened to me.

1:00:06.054 --> 1:00:06.921
You don't even know
why we're fucking here.

1:00:07.188 --> 1:00:07.922
Do tell Jolene.

1:00:08.590 --> 1:00:09.791
Oh, so you don't
want to back me up?

1:00:09.991 --> 1:00:11.026
Pretty, shitty sister huh.

1:00:11.193 --> 1:00:12.162
I have a life too.

1:00:12.327 --> 1:00:13.529
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1:00:13.929 --> 1:00:17.032
Then why don't you
just go fucking back.

1:00:17.232 --> 1:00:18.767
Fuck you, Jolene.

1:00:20.002 --> 1:00:20.969
Fuck you, Jamie.

1:00:21.171 --> 1:00:23.739
Get the fuck off of me.

1:00:23.906 --> 1:00:25.542
Fuck.

1:00:25.675 --> 1:00:26.276
Enough.

1:00:33.850 --> 1:00:37.088
Can we stop acting
so fucking childish?

1:00:37.253 --> 1:00:39.923
We are all each other's got
and we're barely halfway

1:00:40.023 --> 1:00:41.225
through this fucking thing.

1:00:41.392 --> 1:00:45.229
Now get up and leave it there.

1:00:45.296 --> 1:00:48.032
Now can I take my
sick ass back to bed

1:00:48.232 --> 1:00:52.369
and stop dealing with
this childish bullshit?

1:00:52.437 --> 1:00:53.771
Whatever.

1:00:53.938 --> 1:00:55.107
What?

1:00:55.173 --> 1:00:55.773
Nothing.

1:01:18.098 --> 1:01:20.032
I mean, Jesus Joe.

1:01:20.234 --> 1:01:23.002
You didn't even fucking
tell me what happened.

1:01:23.203 --> 1:01:25.506
You just said, uproot your life.

1:01:25.572 --> 1:01:26.773
Let's fucking go.

1:01:34.781 --> 1:01:35.382
Joe.

1:01:39.386 --> 1:01:40.988
What did happen?

1:01:48.496 --> 1:01:53.902
Julie and I we
went to this party.

1:01:54.002 --> 1:01:57.005
I don't want to go partying
at the senator's house,

1:01:57.139 --> 1:01:58.907
drinking with the son
not looking like myself.

1:01:59.007 --> 1:01:59.841
I don't even go
to parties anyway.

1:02:00.008 --> 1:02:01.110
And--

1:02:01.443 --> 1:02:02.378
He's not going to
get you kicked out.

1:02:02.877 --> 1:02:03.912
And he's not even
going to be there.

1:02:04.413 --> 1:02:05.781
Oh, how do you know that?

1:02:08.818 --> 1:02:10.019
I thought I was
going to be fine.

1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:10.754
I mean--

1:02:11.020 --> 1:02:11.621
You're fine.

1:02:11.887 --> 1:02:12.656
Oh God.

1:02:13.055 --> 1:02:15.125
--Julia likes to
go out and I don't.

1:02:15.258 --> 1:02:19.663
I'm just saying you don't
have to be like your sisters.

1:02:19.729 --> 1:02:21.165
And have you really went?

1:02:21.665 --> 1:02:26.970
But I thought before I left,
maybe I'd give it a shot.

1:02:27.171 --> 1:02:29.140
All right, who is going to
be at the party tonight?

1:02:29.273 --> 1:02:29.940
I don't know.

1:02:30.508 --> 1:02:32.276
Just a couple of his friends.

1:02:32.476 --> 1:02:35.011
Have you met his friends?

1:02:35.078 --> 1:02:35.713
I have not.

1:02:35.912 --> 1:02:36.347
Serious?

1:02:36.547 --> 1:02:37.249
Julia--

1:02:37.815 --> 1:02:38.916
Do you not want to fucking go?

1:02:39.184 --> 1:02:39.817
No, I do want to fucking go.

1:02:40.152 --> 1:02:40.751
Then relax.

1:02:54.566 --> 1:02:56.336
Come on in.

1:02:56.635 --> 1:02:59.205
Thank you so much for
having us by the way.

1:02:59.371 --> 1:02:59.972
Thanks.

1:03:11.050 --> 1:03:12.719
I thought I'd be fine.

1:03:25.532 --> 1:03:26.101
Hey, dude.

1:03:26.467 --> 1:03:29.036
What's up?

1:03:29.204 --> 1:03:33.108
Yeah, now I've just got
a couple of girls over.

1:03:33.174 --> 1:03:33.941
Yeah, man.

1:03:34.175 --> 1:03:34.809
Just give me a second.

1:03:57.800 --> 1:03:59.369
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Julia, no.

1:03:59.468 --> 1:04:00.536
Hey, hey, hey.

1:04:00.871 --> 1:04:01.204
Julia, Julia, Julia,
Julia, it's me.

1:04:01.305 --> 1:04:01.671
It's Joe.

1:04:01.971 --> 1:04:02.071
It's Joe.

1:04:02.438 --> 1:04:03.039
It's Joe.

1:04:03.140 --> 1:04:03.572
It's Joe.

1:04:03.740 --> 1:04:04.308
Hey, come on.

1:04:04.573 --> 1:04:05.142
Sit up.

1:04:05.275 --> 1:04:05.909
Sit up.

1:04:06.209 --> 1:04:06.810
Hey, it's me.

1:04:07.076 --> 1:04:07.477
It's me.

1:04:07.678 --> 1:04:08.312
It's me.

1:04:08.512 --> 1:04:09.246
It's me.

1:04:09.746 --> 1:04:10.315
What the fuck is going on?

1:04:10.614 --> 1:04:11.581
Hey, hey.

1:04:11.981 --> 1:04:12.916
You need to calm
down. calm down.

1:04:13.184 --> 1:04:14.118
Come on up.

1:04:14.319 --> 1:04:15.452
Sit up, sit up, sit up.

1:04:15.719 --> 1:04:17.221
OK, I'm going to
lean up against this,

1:04:17.322 --> 1:04:18.488
and then I'll bring your hands.

1:04:18.890 --> 1:04:20.557
We're going to get
you out of here, OK.

1:04:20.624 --> 1:04:22.459
You just need to calm down.

1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:23.728
You just-- look at me.

1:04:23.828 --> 1:04:24.862
I'm going to get
you out of here.

1:04:25.263 --> 1:04:26.365
but you need to stay quiet.

1:04:26.731 --> 1:04:27.899
I'm going to need
you to help me OK?

1:04:28.300 --> 1:04:29.567
Please just get me
the fuck out of here.

1:04:29.667 --> 1:04:30.501
Julia, I--

1:04:30.935 --> 1:04:32.104
Get me the fuck or go to jail.

1:04:32.271 --> 1:04:32.938
It's going to be OK.

1:04:33.405 --> 1:04:34.572
You just need to be quiet.

1:04:34.973 --> 1:04:36.541
I'm going to-- we're going
to get out of here, OK?

1:04:36.775 --> 1:04:38.877
I promise we're going
to get out of here.

1:04:51.925 --> 1:04:52.826
Hello.

1:04:53.025 --> 1:04:54.127
No, it's OK.

1:04:54.260 --> 1:04:55.195
It's OK.

1:04:55.395 --> 1:04:56.796
It's OK.

1:05:18.986 --> 1:05:20.155
It's OK.

1:05:20.288 --> 1:05:21.589
It's OK.

1:05:21.689 --> 1:05:22.257
It's OK.

1:05:24.226 --> 1:05:26.762
Shh.

1:05:26.962 --> 1:05:28.095
Please, please, please.

1:05:28.196 --> 1:05:28.797
Shh.

1:05:33.269 --> 1:05:33.969
It's OK.

1:05:35.405 --> 1:05:36.004
Please.

1:05:41.444 --> 1:05:51.888
We were laying there and I
had to look into her eyes

1:05:52.622 --> 1:05:54.590
all night.

1:05:54.690 --> 1:05:58.796
Yes they're just very lifeless
eyes staring at me back

1:05:58.962 --> 1:06:02.098
on the floor and I couldn't
do anything about it.

1:06:07.704 --> 1:06:17.615
And he had his gun in
my back the whole time

1:06:17.816 --> 1:06:20.885
making me sit there on
the ground with him.

1:06:21.019 --> 1:06:25.291
And part of me just--

1:06:25.458 --> 1:06:27.526
part of me just wanted
him to take that shot

1:06:27.659 --> 1:06:32.531
and just so I could stop
looking into her fucking eyes

1:06:32.598 --> 1:06:42.741
there on the ground with me,
because I could see her eyes

1:06:42.943 --> 1:06:45.212
and I couldn't do
anything to help her.

1:06:45.312 --> 1:06:48.415
I just couldn't do
anything that can help.

1:06:49.816 --> 1:06:52.353
And I just wanted him to stop.

1:06:54.222 --> 1:06:58.825
I just wanted him to
stop because I couldn't.

1:06:59.026 --> 1:07:01.062
I'm so sorry, Joe.

1:07:05.967 --> 1:07:07.603
How are you doing?

1:07:07.935 --> 1:07:14.176
I feel a little better
honestly, but not really myself.

1:07:14.376 --> 1:07:15.244
How are you doing?

1:07:23.352 --> 1:07:25.421
I...

1:07:25.522 --> 1:07:28.158
I just keep thinking that
we're going to get caught.

1:07:31.128 --> 1:07:35.932
And I keep thinking about Julia.

1:07:38.602 --> 1:07:45.543
And I keep thinking
about the birds.

1:07:45.742 --> 1:07:46.709
The birds?

1:07:48.778 --> 1:07:52.683
Right before I
pulled the trigger,

1:07:52.816 --> 1:07:57.855
there were these birds that
flew overhead and running,

1:07:57.922 --> 1:08:02.026
and I both looked
at them and it was

1:08:02.227 --> 1:08:06.932
like we knew that that was the
last thing that he was ever

1:08:06.998 --> 1:08:08.266
going to see.

1:08:08.333 --> 1:08:09.100
It was.

1:08:11.170 --> 1:08:17.042
I know, it's just that I feel
like something something's

1:08:17.177 --> 1:08:18.344
wrong.

1:08:18.544 --> 1:08:21.447
I don't know what it is.

1:08:26.886 --> 1:08:27.787
Channel 19.

1:08:27.987 --> 1:08:29.288
Five minutes.

1:08:29.722 --> 1:08:33.194
And because of this,
protesters have succeeded.

1:08:33.293 --> 1:08:36.230
Senator Kelly will be stepping
down effective immediately.

1:08:36.430 --> 1:08:38.398
So is this what they
wanted us to see?

1:08:38.565 --> 1:08:40.234
No, it's not on yet.

1:08:40.334 --> 1:08:41.902
And a bit
of bizarre news.

1:08:42.302 --> 1:08:45.440
A former doctor, now on
the FBI'S most wanted list

1:08:45.607 --> 1:08:48.142
for a murder of a patient
over five years ago,

1:08:48.209 --> 1:08:49.977
was found dead last night.

1:08:50.179 --> 1:08:52.680
His disappearance,
labeling the case cold,

1:08:52.879 --> 1:08:56.218
authorities were baffled to
find Dr. Richard Penner murdered

1:08:56.417 --> 1:08:58.220
stateside in Colorado.

1:08:58.419 --> 1:09:01.690
There are currently no leads
as to who killed Dr. Penner,

1:09:01.889 --> 1:09:04.393
but investigations are ongoing.

1:09:04.460 --> 1:09:05.494
When we return--

1:09:05.594 --> 1:09:06.395
That was--

1:09:06.662 --> 1:09:07.296
We have to fucking go.

1:09:07.496 --> 1:09:08.264
No.

1:09:08.763 --> 1:09:09.498
Yeah, we have to fucking leave.

1:09:09.732 --> 1:09:10.332
Are you kidding?

1:09:10.798 --> 1:09:12.301
No, we can't leave.

1:09:12.501 --> 1:09:14.570
This is our only way
out of the country.

1:09:14.671 --> 1:09:15.672
If we leave, we lose that.

1:09:15.871 --> 1:09:16.939
We're staying.

1:09:17.273 --> 1:09:18.642
Lee, they found
him and killed him.

1:09:18.974 --> 1:09:20.443
Yeah, but he had
his own hang ups

1:09:20.543 --> 1:09:22.845
that had absolutely
nothing to do with us.

1:09:22.911 --> 1:09:24.314
We have to stay here.

1:09:24.481 --> 1:09:25.814
It's the smartest
decision to make,

1:09:25.915 --> 1:09:26.850
so we're going to make it.

1:09:27.083 --> 1:09:28.219
No one's coming for us.

1:09:28.585 --> 1:09:30.287
As long as we stay
here, we're safe.

1:09:30.353 --> 1:09:32.657
So that's what
we're going to do.

1:09:32.723 --> 1:09:33.323
OK?

1:10:00.652 --> 1:10:04.157
Do you remember that
one time I went to prom?

1:10:06.526 --> 1:10:10.463
Yeah, you had a
beautiful red dress.

1:10:10.596 --> 1:10:13.466
Oh, I loved that dress.

1:10:13.566 --> 1:10:14.434
You looked stunning.

1:10:14.934 --> 1:10:17.837
I mean, absolutely stunning.

1:10:17.904 --> 1:10:22.543
And you went with that guy.

1:10:22.609 --> 1:10:23.477
What was his name?

1:10:25.813 --> 1:10:28.081
Nick.

1:10:28.149 --> 1:10:32.419
Wasn't he that guy that
died in some weird hunting

1:10:32.619 --> 1:10:34.388
accident or something?

1:10:36.457 --> 1:10:40.562
That is what the
official story states.

1:10:42.664 --> 1:10:49.805
But I feel like if we're going
to follow through with this,

1:10:49.904 --> 1:10:51.506
you deserve to know the truth.

1:10:57.580 --> 1:11:03.753
Well, I was a senior
and he was a freshman,

1:11:03.853 --> 1:11:06.956
and no girls had really
paid attention to him yet.

1:11:07.157 --> 1:11:11.194
And that's why I
decided to go with him.

1:11:13.230 --> 1:11:19.069
After the dance, he drove us
out into the middle of nowhere.

1:11:19.137 --> 1:11:29.547
And I-- shit went down and I had
absolutely no choice and no way

1:11:32.784 --> 1:11:33.518
to get home.

1:11:33.984 --> 1:11:34.918
And I was young.

1:11:35.420 --> 1:11:39.792
And you remember how
pissed dad was, right?

1:11:39.924 --> 1:11:43.662
Yeah, he was just fucking
pissed when you didn't come home

1:11:43.796 --> 1:11:45.029
that night.

1:11:45.230 --> 1:11:48.301
But he wasn't pissed
for long, was he?

1:11:48.368 --> 1:11:53.071
Well, I mean, you know dad.

1:11:53.273 --> 1:11:54.841
He always knew when
something was up.

1:11:55.040 --> 1:11:58.745
And he gave it to me straight.

1:11:58.944 --> 1:12:04.950
And he said life
is like a campsite.

1:12:05.050 --> 1:12:07.254
Your only purpose,
your only mission

1:12:07.388 --> 1:12:13.894
is to keep the predators away,
wolves, coyotes, bears, humans.

1:12:14.060 --> 1:12:18.132
Keep them away as long as you
can, and eventually, they're

1:12:18.232 --> 1:12:19.800
going to win.

1:12:20.368 --> 1:12:24.905
But the amount that you take
with you is your strength.

1:12:25.072 --> 1:12:32.914
And that next morning, he drove
me out to that same exact spot

1:12:33.113 --> 1:12:36.618
and I could just tell that
if I gave it to him straight

1:12:36.685 --> 1:12:39.322
and I told him the truth that I
wasn't going to be in trouble,

1:12:39.388 --> 1:12:41.490
and that he would have my
back because that's just

1:12:41.590 --> 1:12:42.825
who dad was.

1:12:43.392 --> 1:12:51.200
And he drove me out there
and I told him everything.

1:12:51.368 --> 1:12:52.369
I told him the truth.

1:12:52.735 --> 1:12:53.703
I told him I didn't
have a choice.

1:12:53.903 --> 1:12:55.339
I was scared.

1:12:55.671 --> 1:12:59.542
He just looked at me and he
just said open the glove box.

1:12:59.642 --> 1:13:00.777
So I opened it.

1:13:01.178 --> 1:13:06.384
And there was just a gun
just sitting in there.

1:13:06.484 --> 1:13:10.954
And he just looked at me
and said, you were there.

1:13:11.053 --> 1:13:12.223
You know what happened.

1:13:12.357 --> 1:13:13.157
This is your choice.

1:13:13.590 --> 1:13:15.326
This is your decision to make.

1:13:15.526 --> 1:13:23.935
And he only said one more
thing, can you live with it?

1:14:09.784 --> 1:14:10.952
Fuck.

1:14:46.089 --> 1:14:47.558
Hey, man.

1:14:50.827 --> 1:14:52.662
Yeah, I'm short.

1:14:55.532 --> 1:14:58.936
Can you give me some?

1:14:59.136 --> 1:15:00.137
Good for it.

1:15:04.708 --> 1:15:05.676
Come on, man.

1:15:07.878 --> 1:15:10.681
If I drop your location
can you meet you there?

1:15:13.385 --> 1:15:14.452
All right, cool.

1:15:14.653 --> 1:15:16.321
I'll see you in a minute.

1:18:34.064 --> 1:18:34.865
So much.

1:18:35.031 --> 1:18:35.666
There you are.

1:18:35.866 --> 1:18:36.335
Anytime.

1:18:36.801 --> 1:18:37.568
Unless I hit you up.

1:18:37.768 --> 1:18:38.203
OK.

1:18:38.402 --> 1:18:39.003
Thanks.

1:18:39.204 --> 1:18:39.971
See you.

1:18:40.172 --> 1:18:41.372
See you.

1:18:52.218 --> 1:18:54.287
Having
trouble sleeping.

1:18:54.486 --> 1:18:57.990
You want to go get bagels?

1:18:58.056 --> 1:18:59.225
I don't know.

1:18:59.424 --> 1:19:01.294
I'm hungry.

1:19:01.426 --> 1:19:05.298
So get ready.

1:19:05.498 --> 1:19:07.268
Best bagels are here.

1:19:07.467 --> 1:19:08.601
Wasn't this worth the drive.

1:19:08.701 --> 1:19:09.869
I don't know.

1:19:10.204 --> 1:19:11.471
Actually I'm going
to go

1:19:11.571 --> 1:19:12.206
Yeah.

1:19:12.572 --> 1:19:16.877
What?

1:19:16.943 --> 1:19:18.111
That's so true.

1:19:18.312 --> 1:19:20.214
I've never been there before.

1:19:20.414 --> 1:19:23.884
It is a pretty good idea.

1:21:52.942 --> 1:21:54.511
You can't let me go.

1:21:54.744 --> 1:21:57.281
I'm stuck in your head
then he don't even know.

1:21:57.448 --> 1:21:58.415
Don't.

1:21:59.016 --> 1:22:01.018
As you can see, I'm
on the better things.

1:22:01.117 --> 1:22:02.520
Ignore the phone when it rings.

1:22:02.753 --> 1:22:04.456
You realize what
you could have had

1:22:04.522 --> 1:22:05.154
so that buzzer on just stings.

1:22:05.222 --> 1:22:06.324
What.

1:22:06.790 --> 1:22:07.925
She playing scenes,
but I'll never trip.

1:22:08.326 --> 1:22:09.593
I'm going to do my
thing and never slip.

1:22:10.195 --> 1:22:13.198
Middle fingers up to a
lion bitch like I know.

1:22:13.331 --> 1:22:13.932
I know.

1:22:14.365 --> 1:22:15.132
You're missing me.

1:22:15.366 --> 1:22:16.534
You're missing me.

1:22:16.868 --> 1:22:18.470
That new man, that new
man, ain't shit I see,

1:22:18.603 --> 1:22:19.337
ain't shit I see.

1:22:20.004 --> 1:22:22.240
I know, I know, you
can't let me go.

1:22:22.374 --> 1:22:23.242
Don't.

1:22:24.008 --> 1:22:26.878
I'm stuck in your head
and he don't even know.

1:22:26.945 --> 1:22:30.249
I know, I know, you're
missing me, you're missing me.

1:22:30.449 --> 1:22:33.185
That new man, that new
man, ain't shit I see,

1:22:33.352 --> 1:22:34.420
ain't shit I see.

1:22:34.720 --> 1:22:37.122
I know, I know, you
can't let me go.

1:22:37.289 --> 1:22:38.425
Don't.

1:22:38.858 --> 1:22:40.560
I'm stuck in your head
and he don't even know.

1:22:40.626 --> 1:22:43.696
I know.

1:22:43.762 --> 1:22:44.598
He knows about me.

1:22:44.763 --> 1:22:47.501
He knows about me.

1:22:47.701 --> 1:22:49.402
He knows about me.

1:22:55.276 --> 1:22:58.879
I know, I know, you're
missing me, you're missing me.

1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:02.749
That new man, that new man ain't
shit I see, ain't shit I see.

1:23:02.817 --> 1:23:05.953
I know, I know you
can't let me go.

1:23:06.153 --> 1:23:08.956
I'm stuck in your head
and he don't even know.

1:23:09.090 --> 1:23:10.057
Don't.

1:23:10.459 --> 1:23:11.993
As you can see, I'm
on the better things.

1:23:12.093 --> 1:23:13.661
Ignore the phone when it rings.

1:23:14.196 --> 1:23:16.532
You realize you could have had
so that buzzer on just stings.

1:23:16.664 --> 1:23:17.698
What?

1:23:18.167 --> 1:23:19.468
She playing scenes
but I'll never trip.

1:23:19.868 --> 1:23:21.236
I'm going to do my
thing and never slip.

1:23:21.503 --> 1:23:24.206
Middle little fingers
up to a lion bitch like.

1:24:32.011 --> 1:24:33.447
Nice try, asshole.

1:24:48.496 --> 1:24:49.129
Shh.

1:24:49.330 --> 1:24:49.763
I know.

1:24:49.963 --> 1:24:50.565
I know.

1:24:50.931 --> 1:24:51.532
I know.

1:24:51.733 --> 1:24:52.433
I know.

1:24:52.866 --> 1:24:53.434
Please, You have to be quiet.

1:24:53.635 --> 1:24:54.203
Shh.

1:24:54.402 --> 1:24:55.003
Joe.

1:24:55.270 --> 1:24:55.670
Joe.

1:24:55.903 --> 1:24:56.537
Hey, hey.

1:24:56.838 --> 1:24:58.106
Not right now.

1:24:58.240 --> 1:24:58.906
OK.

1:25:09.884 --> 1:25:12.354
We need management.

1:25:25.901 --> 1:25:27.337
Come on.

1:25:32.442 --> 1:25:33.877
All right, let's go.

1:25:33.943 --> 1:25:34.844
Come on, Joe, get your shoes on.

1:25:34.944 --> 1:25:36.079
OK.

1:25:36.480 --> 1:25:39.550
I'm going to get
you out of here.

1:25:39.650 --> 1:25:40.318
Hurry up, hurry up--

1:25:40.584 --> 1:25:41.186
I'm trying.

1:25:41.452 --> 1:25:42.119
I'm trying.

1:25:42.386 --> 1:25:43.154
I'm trying.

1:25:49.561 --> 1:25:50.662
You're coming too, right?

1:25:50.762 --> 1:25:51.430
I'll be right behind you.

1:25:51.563 --> 1:25:52.230
Go.

1:25:52.431 --> 1:25:52.798
Go, Joe.

1:25:52.997 --> 1:25:53.565
Go.

1:25:53.765 --> 1:25:54.399
Go.

1:25:54.599 --> 1:25:55.201
OK.

1:27:39.244 --> 1:27:40.545
Where's Joelene?

1:27:40.746 --> 1:27:44.483
We only ordered drinks.

1:27:44.683 --> 1:27:45.484
Where is he?

1:27:45.651 --> 1:27:47.018
I don't know.

1:27:47.219 --> 1:27:49.389
All right, we got to
get you out of here.

1:27:59.899 --> 1:28:00.700
Lee.

1:28:00.966 --> 1:28:02.602
Oh my God, Lee.

1:28:02.735 --> 1:28:04.671
Lee.

1:28:04.737 --> 1:28:05.372
OK.

1:28:05.572 --> 1:28:06.138
Come on.

1:28:06.473 --> 1:28:08.375
Come on.

1:28:08.442 --> 1:28:10.577
We got to get to the truck.

1:28:10.643 --> 1:28:11.578
Come on.

1:29:21.619 --> 1:29:22.654
Come on.

1:29:22.787 --> 1:29:23.588
We got to go.

1:29:25.155 --> 1:29:27.293
Lee, you got to move please.

1:29:28.260 --> 1:29:29.060
Lee, come on.

1:29:29.461 --> 1:29:30.061
We're almost there.

1:29:30.462 --> 1:29:31.696
Please stay with me.

1:29:32.231 --> 1:29:33.799
Please, please,
please, please, please.

1:29:38.771 --> 1:29:40.104
Lee.

1:29:40.205 --> 1:29:40.773
Hey, no.

1:29:40.906 --> 1:29:41.541
Uh-uh.

1:29:41.674 --> 1:29:42.207
No.

1:29:42.608 --> 1:29:43.709
No, we're not giving up now.

1:29:43.909 --> 1:29:44.511
You need to get up.

1:29:44.710 --> 1:29:45.278
Joe.

1:29:45.611 --> 1:29:46.078
No, Lee.

1:29:46.212 --> 1:29:47.013
Get up, Lee.

1:29:47.447 --> 1:29:48.548
You have to go without me.

1:29:48.814 --> 1:29:49.615
Lee, you have to get up.

1:29:49.916 --> 1:29:50.616
This isn't a fucking game.

1:29:50.817 --> 1:29:51.518
Get up.

1:29:51.885 --> 1:29:54.054
Joe, you have to go.

1:29:54.220 --> 1:29:55.456
No, it's my fault
that we're here.

1:29:55.589 --> 1:29:56.390
It's my fault.

1:29:56.823 --> 1:29:58.392
Lee I'm not fucking
leaving you here.

1:30:00.060 --> 1:30:00.727
Lee, please get up.

1:30:00.961 --> 1:30:01.529
You have to go.

1:30:01.728 --> 1:30:02.330
No.

1:30:03.464 --> 1:30:04.465
Joe, you have to go.

1:30:04.865 --> 1:30:05.765
Not without you.

1:30:05.866 --> 1:30:06.867
I love you, OK?

1:30:07.001 --> 1:30:07.835
Go.

1:30:07.969 --> 1:30:08.569
Go.

1:30:10.771 --> 1:30:11.973
I love you.

1:30:12.073 --> 1:30:12.873
I love you.

1:34:27.944 --> 1:34:30.281
Miss Holton.

1:34:30.413 --> 1:34:33.116
I've been waiting for this call.

1:34:33.183 --> 1:34:37.053
No one, very good.

1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:41.392
Understand you hurt my
family, Miss Holton.

1:34:41.592 --> 1:34:43.494
You can't do that
and get away with it.

1:34:43.561 --> 1:34:45.731
It makes me look bad.

1:34:45.930 --> 1:34:49.234
You have to be made an example.

1:34:49.434 --> 1:34:54.274
No one will be able to prove
this was me, but they'll know

1:34:54.406 --> 1:34:55.741
and they'll fear.

1:34:58.311 --> 1:35:00.412
Go ahead and apologize now.

1:35:00.479 --> 1:35:03.048
I've been waiting for this.

1:35:03.181 --> 1:35:03.982
Fuck you.

1:39:19.821 --> 1:39:25.093
Face so
pale and white.

1:39:25.260 --> 1:39:28.364
It's shadowed as the grave.

1:39:30.366 --> 1:39:36.439
Savage silhouette,
drapery sorrow.

1:40:01.666 --> 1:40:07.339
They beck and call each night.

1:40:07.439 --> 1:40:08.406
Of a solitary night.

1:40:13.211 --> 1:40:19.017
Scavenger of rot
cooks the marrow.

1:41:27.190 --> 1:41:30.360
Ravenous and roaring rage.

1:41:30.460 --> 1:41:32.730
Assume the forest,
spite the page.

1:41:32.797 --> 1:41:35.566
Safe for now, lie in a cage.

1:41:35.733 --> 1:41:38.101
Evil now will burn in sage.

1:41:57.855 --> 1:42:02.894
A criminous bent with age,
sour smile, the puppet age.

1:42:02.994 --> 1:42:03.763
Mountain now.

1:42:03.862 --> 1:42:04.963
winds of change.

1:42:05.030 --> 1:42:08.601
Endless now, the war we wage.
