00:02.232 --> 00:02.721
Ty!

00:04.034 --> 00:05.296
Ty, Spartan's gone.

00:05.402 --> 00:07.495
You don't have to come pick me
all the way at the ranch.

00:09.039 --> 00:09.733
Hey.

00:10.074 --> 00:12.338
Everything okay?

00:12.443 --> 00:13.842
We have to face facts.

00:13.943 --> 00:15.104
You may not find him.

00:15.212 --> 00:16.839
- Ty, that's him.
- Sold the horse.

00:16.947 --> 00:18.312
$1,800, buyer number 61.

00:18.415 --> 00:20.975
He was all I had left of her.

00:21.085 --> 00:22.848
She died trying to save him.

00:22.953 --> 00:25.080
He is my horse, and no one's
gonna take him from me.

00:25.189 --> 00:27.521
How are you gonna get Spartan
out of a locked auction house

00:27.624 --> 00:29.387
with a guard duty on site?

00:29.560 --> 00:31.187
What the hell were you thinking?

00:32.695 --> 00:35.961
You are grounded
until further notice.

Spartan, what's going on with you?

01:44.134 --> 01:45.032
What?

01:45.135 --> 01:47.569
I didn't know you had a chalet
in the mountains.

01:49.973 --> 01:54.205
And what exactly does one do
with three fireplaces?

01:54.311 --> 01:57.303
Peter, that sounds amazing,
but I can't.

01:57.414 --> 02:00.178
Because I just launched
my new winter marketing campaign,

02:00.284 --> 02:02.775
and I have to stick around
in case I get a booking.

02:02.886 --> 02:05.855
Okay, look,
next weekend for sure, okay?

02:05.956 --> 02:07.355
I'll call you later. Bye.

02:07.457 --> 02:10.824
Lou, I don't want to tell you
how to bale your own hay,

02:10.961 --> 02:13.589
but I think you're wasting your time
with this new campaign.

02:13.697 --> 02:16.393
There's a reason that dude ranches
shut down in the winter.

02:16.500 --> 02:20.459
Well, not this one.

02:20.771 --> 02:24.434
"Heartland's Winter Wonderland."

02:24.541 --> 02:28.136
Cross-country skiing,
ice-skating, hay rides.

02:28.312 --> 02:29.301
What's not to like?

02:29.413 --> 02:34.077
How about it being so cold
your nose hairs freeze?

02:36.887 --> 02:37.911
How was your ride?

02:38.021 --> 02:39.249
It was fine.

02:39.356 --> 02:40.755
Are you limping?

02:40.857 --> 02:41.789
No.

02:47.264 --> 02:49.562
and there was this tree
lying across the trail.

02:49.666 --> 02:50.792
Well, more like a branch.

02:50.901 --> 02:52.766
And he just stopped,
and I went flying.

02:52.869 --> 02:54.166
You okay?

02:54.838 --> 02:56.135
Yeah.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.935
Well, a guy from Blackhills Ranch
just called.

02:58.041 --> 02:59.599
He says he's got a horse
that won't load,

02:59.710 --> 03:01.075
so I told him
to bring him by tomorrow.

03:01.178 --> 03:01.837
Tomorrow?

03:01.945 --> 03:02.604
Great.

03:02.713 --> 03:04.078
Is that a problem?

03:04.181 --> 03:05.079
No.

03:05.182 --> 03:07.446
Just that I've been working
with Spartan for days,

03:07.551 --> 03:08.540
and I can't even fix him.

03:08.652 --> 03:10.176
How am I supposed to fix
someone else's horse?

03:10.287 --> 03:11.845
What's going on, Amy?

03:11.955 --> 03:12.979
I don't know!

03:13.090 --> 03:15.854
I told you.
He's afraid to jump.

03:16.159 --> 03:18.525
I'm not talking about Spartan.

03:18.629 --> 03:21.291
What is that supposed to mean?

03:21.398 --> 03:22.888
I saw you in the ring the other day.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.934
You were tensing up,
leaning back in your saddle,

03:25.035 --> 03:27.367
jerking your reins
like you were in another world.

03:27.471 --> 03:28.870
I was not leaning back
in my saddle,

03:28.972 --> 03:30.633
and I was definitely not
jerking my reins, okay?

03:30.741 --> 03:31.765
Spartan's just freaked out

03:31.908 --> 03:33.705
because Wes walked in here
in the middle of the night,

03:33.810 --> 03:36.836
and he stole him
while you were asleep upstairs!

03:42.219 --> 03:43.652
Ty, I'm s...

03:46.390 --> 03:48.881
I didn't mean it.

03:49.426 --> 03:52.156
See, Grandpa, you've got to know
your target market.

03:52.262 --> 03:54.787
So far, I've sent brochures
to travel agencies,

03:54.898 --> 03:57.128
tourism offices,
and corporations.

03:57.234 --> 04:00.328
How about the Russian Laplanders?
I hear they really like the cold.

06:38.862 --> 06:40.159
You know, Ty,

06:40.330 --> 06:42.298
the whole point is to get Harley

with Spartan?

07:24.307 --> 07:25.205
I don't know,

07:25.308 --> 07:27.708
but I think that Wes
screwed him up pretty bad.

07:27.811 --> 07:31.247
Well, I'm sure you'll figure it out.

Hey, Grandpa.

07:48.231 --> 07:51.098
Hand me that ratchet, would you?

07:55.672 --> 07:58.106

I could take Spartan to see Victor.

08:00.877 --> 08:02.742
No, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

08:02.879 --> 08:03.868
Why not?

08:04.080 --> 08:05.707
Well, for starters,
you're still grounded.

08:05.815 --> 08:08.249
Well, you could always
ground me for another week

at the end of my sentence.

08:10.887 --> 08:12.445

Well, I was hoping
maybe you could drive me.

08:23.767 --> 08:27.828
Grandpa, I've done everything I know
to try and fix Spartan.

08:30.206 --> 08:32.436
You have to call him first
and see if he's even still up there.

08:32.542 --> 08:34.169
- He might be...
- I already did.

08:35.511 --> 08:38.275
He's expecting me tomorrow.

08:38.381 --> 08:39.905
Tomorrow!
Amy, you can't.

- That's just great.

my guests on trail rides?

to get away for a while.

09:01.805 --> 09:04.774

09:04.874 --> 09:08.037
Like I said, they were friends.

09:08.144 --> 09:10.840
But good friends, or...?

09:10.947 --> 09:13.507
Yeah, I guess.

09:13.617 --> 09:15.915
So, how come
she didn't talk about him?

09:16.019 --> 09:17.008
She did.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.815
Always spoke very highly of him, too.

09:18.922 --> 09:21.152
You're probably just too young
to remember.

09:21.257 --> 09:23.782

- Okay.

Jerry Springer on those two.

to Victor first?

when I come back to pick you up.

I'm serious.

really, really busy.

the folks at Mountain Direct

12:40.723 --> 12:44.659

doing a horse clinic

12:44.761 --> 12:46.353
when she made her journey.

12:48.598 --> 12:52.034
Didn't find out until I got back.

12:55.071 --> 13:00.134

into the west.

13:03.780 --> 13:06.408

are sure with me today.

13:12.155 --> 13:13.179
Your turn.

13:13.289 --> 13:15.883
Oh, no. I've never golfed before.

13:15.992 --> 13:17.721
No time like the present.

all four sacred nations here.

13:26.469 --> 13:28.562
Ah, the red nation.
Good choice.

13:30.073 --> 13:32.268
Just hold the club like this, here,

13:32.375 --> 13:37.642
and then a nice gentle swing
and Tonto's your uncle.

13:44.087 --> 13:45.611
Lifted your head on that one.

13:45.722 --> 13:47.917
Wanted to see where the ball
was going, eh?

13:48.024 --> 13:50.254
Go ahead.
Give it another try.

13:51.494 --> 13:54.486
Just keep the little round globe
right in front of you.

13:59.435 --> 14:00.402
Okey-dokey.

14:01.371 --> 14:03.236
Well, let's go say hello
to your horse.

14:10.513 --> 14:13.209
Just pull up right in front.

14:23.293 --> 14:26.729
So, this is the famous Lou Fleming
Equestrian Connection, huh?

14:26.829 --> 14:28.262
- Yep.
- Oh, hey, I can get...

14:28.364 --> 14:30.764
That's okay. I got it.

14:32.802 --> 14:33.894
Wow!

14:34.003 --> 14:35.163
It's amazing, Lou.

14:35.271 --> 14:37.831
Mother Nature at her finest.

14:40.643 --> 14:41.905
That was quite the entrance.

14:42.011 --> 14:45.572
Yeah, I couldn't wait for you
to see this place.

14:45.682 --> 14:48.116
So, what do you think?

14:48.217 --> 14:51.050
It's very nice.

14:51.154 --> 14:52.712
Very nice.

14:53.890 --> 14:56.120
And dark.

14:56.225 --> 15:00.992
That way, it's more romantic
when we light the fire.

15:01.097 --> 15:03.895
Oh. Can't wait for that.

15:04.467 --> 15:06.458
Me too.

15:07.170 --> 15:10.367
So, I'm gonna let you get settled.

15:10.473 --> 15:11.701
- Settled?
- Mm-hmm.

15:11.808 --> 15:13.833
I'm settled.

15:13.977 --> 15:16.468
Oh, I need to go
and tell my ranch hand

15:16.579 --> 15:18.547
that I won't be needing
all those trail horses.

15:18.648 --> 15:19.876
Well, we'll need a couple, right?

15:19.983 --> 15:21.382
You want to go ride?

15:21.484 --> 15:23.418
- Yeah. I'll come help you.
- No! No!

15:23.519 --> 15:26.750
You can stay here and light the fire.
Do you know how to light a fire?

15:26.856 --> 15:28.380
- Oh, I think so.
- Okay.

15:28.891 --> 15:29.949
Well, I will be right back,

15:30.059 --> 15:32.755
and you just don't go anywhere
without me, okay?

15:32.862 --> 15:34.261
Just stay. Yeah.

15:36.265 --> 15:37.459
Oh, my God!

15:38.668 --> 15:39.726
How you doing?

15:39.902 --> 15:42.200
Almost done.

15:45.475 --> 15:46.533
You okay?

15:46.642 --> 15:49.475
I just jogged from the dude ranch.

15:50.213 --> 15:53.376
Turns out I won't be needing
your services after all.

15:53.483 --> 15:54.848
There's only one guest.

15:54.951 --> 15:56.748
I thought you said
the cabins were booked.

15:56.853 --> 15:58.286
Yeah. Yeah, they are.

15:58.388 --> 15:59.912
He's a very private person.

16:00.023 --> 16:03.220
So, I'll take those two.

16:03.326 --> 16:05.453
Oh, he doesn't want
anyone else around.

16:05.561 --> 16:07.586
So, just stay away
from the dude ranch,

16:07.697 --> 16:09.756
and make sure you tell Mallory.

16:09.866 --> 16:10.764
Okay.

16:10.867 --> 16:12.300
Thanks, sweetie.

16:12.402 --> 16:14.029
All right.

16:16.339 --> 16:19.331
Looks like we got
a little free time on our hands.

16:19.509 --> 16:22.239
Um, actually, I was thinking
about working with Harley for a bit.

16:22.345 --> 16:24.575
You know, there's only one thing
that I like more

16:24.680 --> 16:27.240
than watching a cowboy
break a horse.

16:27.350 --> 16:29.079
Helping him break a horse.

16:45.334 --> 16:46.323
See?

16:47.670 --> 16:50.161
I don't know. I don't understand.
He usually loves to jump.

16:52.275 --> 16:54.243
I don't know why he won't.

16:54.343 --> 16:56.334
There's an old Indian saying.

16:56.446 --> 16:58.141
You can't know a horse's heart

16:58.247 --> 17:00.841
until you've walked a few miles
in his horseshoes.

17:00.950 --> 17:02.975
What do you say we go for a walk?

17:03.086 --> 17:04.747
We just got here.

17:04.854 --> 17:06.913
Can I borrow that?
Your watch.

17:07.022 --> 17:08.490
Sure.

17:09.559 --> 17:11.026
You got a cell phone?

17:11.828 --> 17:12.521
Yeah.

17:12.627 --> 17:14.117
Can I borrow that, too?

17:14.230 --> 17:16.095
Okay.

17:18.101 --> 17:19.125
Horses don't know

17:19.234 --> 17:21.635
that between the rising and setting
of Grandfather Sun

17:21.737 --> 17:25.229
there's this little thing
we humans call time.

17:28.344 --> 17:29.743
Coming?

17:33.983 --> 17:36.850
So, you just tie a nice,
soft cotton rope around him

17:37.553 --> 17:39.612
so it won't burn him or cut him.

17:39.722 --> 17:41.189
There you go.
Good boy.

17:43.493 --> 17:45.654
And now we have control of him.

17:46.996 --> 17:49.487
So, we can sack him out,
put a saddle on him,

17:49.599 --> 17:50.725
do whatever we want,

17:50.833 --> 17:52.801
and he can't kick us or run away.

17:52.902 --> 17:54.631
Seems kind of cruel,
don't you think?

17:54.737 --> 17:57.069
Well, it's only cruel
if the person doing the tying

17:57.173 --> 17:58.572
doesn't know what they're doing.

17:58.674 --> 18:00.767
I don't know. I just...

18:00.877 --> 18:02.208
It feels weird.

18:03.546 --> 18:05.673
'Cause it's not Amy's way.

18:05.781 --> 18:08.249
No, just...

18:08.351 --> 18:10.819
I can't do this.

18:11.487 --> 18:12.146
Fine.

18:13.089 --> 18:15.785
You do it her way.

18:18.761 --> 18:22.458
So, you and your mom
rescued this...

18:22.665 --> 18:24.155
What's his name?

18:24.267 --> 18:25.063
Spartan.

18:25.168 --> 18:27.636
Right, Spartan.

18:27.737 --> 18:30.331
From this guy.

18:30.439 --> 18:32.134
Yeah.

18:32.241 --> 18:34.607
It was pretty stormy
that night, and...

18:34.710 --> 18:39.841
Well, we just kind of,
you know...

18:40.650 --> 18:43.084
Spartan must be
pretty special to you.

18:43.186 --> 18:44.847
Yeah.

18:47.557 --> 18:51.960
Must have been pretty scary
when he was stolen from you.

18:55.665 --> 18:58.395
So, he's a jumper.

18:58.501 --> 19:02.767
Yeah. I started entering him
in competitions last year.

19:02.872 --> 19:06.069
Ty was my coach.
We actually won the Fall Finale.

19:06.175 --> 19:08.109
Who's Ty?

19:08.211 --> 19:10.645
He's just a friend.

19:11.247 --> 19:13.545
He's still your coach?

19:13.649 --> 19:15.378
No.

19:15.484 --> 19:17.782
No, I've just been kind of busy
this year with school

19:17.887 --> 19:19.650
and with other horses,

19:19.755 --> 19:21.279
and on top of it all,

19:21.390 --> 19:24.450
our stable hand just left
for the rodeo circuit, so...

19:24.560 --> 19:27.654
Sounds like you've got
a lot of bannock on your plate.

19:27.763 --> 19:28.855
Yeah.

19:28.965 --> 19:34.062
Well, it's just the way it is,
I guess.

19:34.971 --> 19:39.874
So, what's your plan with Spartan?

19:39.976 --> 19:42.137
Don't have one.

19:42.245 --> 19:45.339
Bet this river
doesn't have a plan either.

19:45.448 --> 19:47.006
Bet it doesn't sit around

19:47.116 --> 19:50.142
wondering where it came from
or where it's going.

19:50.253 --> 19:53.518
It just kind of goes with the flow.

19:54.590 --> 19:56.387
Maybe a good thing
for us two-leggeds

19:56.492 --> 19:59.655
to learn from that river, eh?

20:13.476 --> 20:14.602
Easy.

20:16.445 --> 20:17.844
There you go.

20:18.447 --> 20:20.574
So, how goes the battle today?

20:21.851 --> 20:23.045
He still won't listen to me.

20:23.753 --> 20:25.220
What are you trying to tell him?

20:25.321 --> 20:26.686
It's no use, Jack.

20:28.124 --> 20:30.183
He's not gonna be broke
by the time she gets back.

20:30.293 --> 20:31.385
Who?

20:33.562 --> 20:34.893
Oh.

20:35.064 --> 20:36.622
- I just wanted to...
- Impress her?

20:36.732 --> 20:38.632
No.

20:40.102 --> 20:41.069
Well...

20:41.170 --> 20:42.637
Maybe, yeah.

20:44.006 --> 20:45.667
The thing about breaking a horse, Ty,

20:45.775 --> 20:48.369
is if you go at it
like you got 15 minutes,

20:48.477 --> 20:49.705
it'll take you all day.

20:49.812 --> 20:51.643
If you go at it
like you've got all day,

20:51.747 --> 20:54.045
well, it'll take you 15 minutes.

20:54.150 --> 20:56.209
You hear that, Harley?

20:56.319 --> 20:57.843
We've got all day, buddy.

21:14.003 --> 21:15.664
See that, Jack?

21:15.771 --> 21:16.897
Nothing to it.

21:19.208 --> 21:19.697
Whoa!

21:20.476 --> 21:21.670
Easy, boy, easy.

21:22.211 --> 21:23.542
Easy, Harley! Come on!

21:29.418 --> 21:30.180
Whoa!

21:36.492 --> 21:38.653
Yeah. Nothing to it.

21:53.175 --> 21:55.370
Grandpa. You're back.

21:55.478 --> 21:59.107
I believe I still live here,
unless you've booked out my room.

21:59.215 --> 22:02.309
I just...
I wasn't expecting you until later.

22:02.418 --> 22:04.648
Ty told me only one guest arrived.

22:04.754 --> 22:07.154
Yeah, and he rented out
all the cabins, too.

22:07.256 --> 22:09.918
He wants total
and utter privacy, so...

22:10.025 --> 22:12.493
Not another
confidentiality agreement.

22:12.595 --> 22:14.358
No, no. Nothing like that.

22:14.463 --> 22:17.990
But if you guys could just stay away
from the dude ranch, that'd be great.

22:18.100 --> 22:18.896
Fine by me.

22:19.001 --> 22:21.629
That's weird. Why does he want
total and utter privacy?

22:21.737 --> 22:22.635
I don't know, Mallory.

22:22.738 --> 22:24.569
Some people just like
the peace and quiet, okay?

22:24.673 --> 22:26.436
I mean, I know that's hard
for you to comprehend,

22:26.542 --> 22:27.440
but it does happen.

22:27.543 --> 22:29.636
What if he's another oil slick
pretending to be nice,

22:29.745 --> 22:31.576
but really he's just drilling
on Jack's land?

22:31.680 --> 22:34.740
Mallory, he is not an oil slick, okay?

22:38.187 --> 22:39.916
Sensitive much?

22:44.760 --> 22:45.920
- Mmm.
- Is that good?

22:46.028 --> 22:46.995
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

22:47.096 --> 22:48.461
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:48.564 --> 22:50.498
Except now you have...

22:50.666 --> 22:51.963
What?

22:52.067 --> 22:54.262
You have some chocolate.

Ah.

I'm so sorry.

- I have to take this.
- Okay.

23:03.479 --> 23:04.810
I'm sorry. It just could be...

23:06.115 --> 23:08.675
Hey, what's up?

23:08.784 --> 23:10.718
Oh, my God, no.
Is it his heart?

23:12.354 --> 23:14.015
Well, that's good.

23:14.123 --> 23:17.388
Let me guess. He was fixing the roof
and fell off the ladder, right?

23:17.493 --> 23:19.324
Mr. Handyman.

23:19.428 --> 23:21.487
It's my father-in-law.
It's okay. Sorry.

23:21.597 --> 23:25.727
No, sure, I can definitely
take Max for the weekend.

23:25.835 --> 23:27.530
Can you just pack up
his stuff for me,

23:27.636 --> 23:29.399
and I'll be there
in a couple hours?

23:29.505 --> 23:31.370
Yeah. No problem.

23:31.474 --> 23:34.272
Okay. Bye.

23:34.810 --> 23:37.802
Lou, I'm so sorry.

23:42.918 --> 23:43.850
I don't know, Grandpa.

23:43.953 --> 23:46.615
I don't see what Mom got
out of coming here.

23:46.722 --> 23:49.589
I mean, all we do is golf
and go for walks.

23:49.692 --> 23:52.217
Yeah, we haven't even worked
with Spartan once.

23:52.328 --> 23:55.855
I don't know.
I'm just saying that maybe...

24:04.306 --> 24:05.739
Yeah, I'm still here.

24:07.810 --> 24:12.076
I was just saying that maybe
I just need to get used

to Victor's style of horsemanship.

I must have lost track of time.

needs some fresh towels.

- All right.

I think you're forgetting something.

Right. The towels.
Where's my head?

How well did you know my mother?

26:14.403 --> 26:16.701
You lifted your head on that one.

26:20.376 --> 26:22.401
Were you and my mom
more than friends?

26:25.280 --> 26:27.248
Yes, at one time.

26:28.751 --> 26:31.151
I met your mom at a mustang rally.

She was on a mission to rescue
this pinto from being put down.

with horses, Amy.

26:45.134 --> 26:46.192
Now it's your gift.

26:47.536 --> 26:51.336
I'm not so sure about that.
I can't even fix Spartan.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.670
Maybe Spartan doesn't need fixing.

26:53.776 --> 26:56.370
He's a star jumper
who refuses to jump.

26:56.478 --> 26:59.538
I don't jump

27:28.410 --> 27:29.934
What's going on?

27:30.045 --> 27:32.605
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me, Mr. Secretive?

27:32.715 --> 27:33.613
What?

27:33.716 --> 27:35.980
You have a family!
You have a wife!

27:36.085 --> 27:37.347
No.

27:37.453 --> 27:38.078
Yes.

27:38.187 --> 27:39.449
No, an ex-wife.

27:39.555 --> 27:40.920
Many years ex.

27:41.023 --> 27:42.285
And I didn't say anything about it

27:42.391 --> 27:43.756
because I didn't think
it was a big deal.

27:43.859 --> 27:44.883
Yeah. No big deal. Right.

27:44.993 --> 27:47.154
You know, everyone has an ex-wife.
Heck, I have an ex-wife!

27:47.262 --> 27:49.492
Okay. Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

27:49.631 --> 27:50.791
Whoa! Whoa!

27:50.933 --> 27:52.560
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

27:52.668 --> 27:53.828
I'm so sorry.

27:53.969 --> 27:54.936
Come on. Come on, Max.

27:55.070 --> 27:55.832
Max, sit.

27:56.004 --> 27:56.561
Are you okay?

27:56.705 --> 27:59.333
He gets really excited
when he meets new people.

27:59.441 --> 28:00.339
I'm so sorry.

28:00.442 --> 28:01.340
Maxy!

28:01.443 --> 28:05.174
Wait, wait.
Max is your dog?

28:05.280 --> 28:06.508
Yeah, he's my dog.

28:08.317 --> 28:10.979
Oh, my God!
Did you think he was my...?

28:11.317 --> 28:13.479
Lou, I would have told you
if I had a kid.

28:15.124 --> 28:16.421
What kind of guy
do you think I am?

28:38.613 --> 28:41.582
Sometimes I like to put down
a little grandmother stone

28:41.683 --> 28:43.742
to give thanks.

28:44.353 --> 28:47.845
Sometimes to ask for direction.

28:47.956 --> 28:52.222
Sometimes I like to say a prayer
for a loved one who's hurting

28:52.327 --> 28:56.024
or one who's journeyed
to the spirit world.

28:56.131 --> 28:57.393
You mean died?

28:58.734 --> 29:01.703
No such thing as death, my girl.

29:01.803 --> 29:06.536
Just a continuation of spirit.
A change of worlds.

29:06.641 --> 29:09.075
Around and around the wheel we go.

29:09.778 --> 29:13.441
Well, what is this?

29:14.049 --> 29:15.880
The spirit of life.

29:15.984 --> 29:19.181
Some people call it
a medicine wheel.

29:19.287 --> 29:21.050
What does it do?

29:21.156 --> 29:23.716
We'd be here a lifetime
if I shared with you

29:23.825 --> 29:27.352
all the teachings
my moshum shared with me.

29:27.462 --> 29:31.523
I'll just give you
the Coles Notes version.

29:31.633 --> 29:33.999
There are four directions, right?

29:34.102 --> 29:35.433
Right.

29:35.537 --> 29:40.236
The east, the south,
the west, the north.

29:40.342 --> 29:42.207
Okay, so, rooted
in those four directions

29:42.310 --> 29:45.575
are the four aspects of self...

29:45.680 --> 29:53.553
our emotions, physical body,
mind, and spirit.

29:53.688 --> 29:57.317
Trickiest part is keeping them
all balanced.

29:57.426 --> 30:01.863
If one side of the wheel is out,
all sides are out

30:01.963 --> 30:06.127
and we end up walking around
like the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

30:08.437 --> 30:12.373
But when we stand in the center
of our lives and find balance,

30:12.474 --> 30:17.309
then we can connect with others
in a good way.

30:19.414 --> 30:20.847
Even horses.

30:22.384 --> 30:27.412
Little doorway there to the east...
the direction of new beginnings.

30:27.522 --> 30:31.652
Why don't you go stand
in the center of the circle?

30:53.181 --> 30:55.581
Victor?

31:32.621 --> 31:34.646
Got yourself
a mighty fine horse there.

31:35.457 --> 31:38.392
He's pretty awesome.

31:39.294 --> 31:41.762
Of course,
he still has a lot to learn.

31:41.863 --> 31:43.694
But he trusts you.
That's the main thing.

31:43.798 --> 31:45.732
You want to hold on to that.

31:45.834 --> 31:48.428
Just keep being clear and direct
with him.

31:48.537 --> 31:50.698
Can't waffle.
Otherwise, you'll just confuse him.

31:54.209 --> 31:56.575
Oh, almost forgot.

31:56.678 --> 31:59.238
Kit called... again.

32:00.549 --> 32:04.645
Said she's been trying
to get ahold of you all day.

32:07.422 --> 32:10.016
Basically, we were just
really good friends

32:10.125 --> 32:12.457
that never should have gotten married
in the first place, you know?

32:12.561 --> 32:16.930
So, we separated
and remained friends.

32:17.032 --> 32:19.262
And we're both a lot happier.

32:19.367 --> 32:22.234
And you share custody of Max?

32:22.337 --> 32:24.430
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

32:24.539 --> 32:25.972
I wouldn't be able to live

32:26.074 --> 32:29.271
if I didn't get to see
old Maxy boy here, eh?

32:30.412 --> 32:32.437
So, now that you've met my dog,
it stands to reason

32:32.547 --> 32:34.845
that you would introduce me
to your family, right?

32:34.950 --> 32:36.975
My family?

32:38.253 --> 32:40.517
Don't think I haven't noticed
you've been holding me hostage

32:40.622 --> 32:41.680
in the dude ranch all weekend.

32:41.790 --> 32:44.725
Not that I mind. Honestly.
Because I don't.

32:44.826 --> 32:46.760
But you still haven't told them
about me, have you?

32:47.262 --> 32:51.722
Well, you know, not exactly.

32:53.935 --> 32:56.460
No, I haven't.

32:56.571 --> 32:57.469
But I will.

32:57.572 --> 32:58.698
- Yeah?
- Yes.

32:58.807 --> 32:59.774
Promise?

32:59.908 --> 33:01.842
Yes, I promise.

33:01.943 --> 33:03.103
I got something for you.

33:03.211 --> 33:05.008
I was gonna give it to you
last night,

33:05.113 --> 33:06.705
but I got the 911 Max call.

33:06.881 --> 33:08.439
So, there you go.

33:11.653 --> 33:13.245
Oh, my God!

33:14.189 --> 33:15.986
Peter, these are beautiful.

33:16.091 --> 33:17.149
Yeah? You like them?

33:17.259 --> 33:17.918
Yes!

33:18.426 --> 33:20.986
You know what?
I can't take these.

33:21.096 --> 33:22.586
They're way too much.

33:22.697 --> 33:26.565
Hey, nothing is too much
for Lou Fleming.

33:29.771 --> 33:31.170
[Max barks]

33:31.273 --> 33:31.967
Hey.

33:32.741 --> 33:35.767
What do you want?

33:39.848 --> 33:42.248
The last time
your mom came to see me,

33:42.350 --> 33:44.784
she thought she had lost her way.

33:45.453 --> 33:49.446
She wanted clear answers
about her life.

33:49.557 --> 33:51.718
Yes and no.

33:51.826 --> 33:53.418
Right and wrong.

33:53.528 --> 33:56.019
Should she take this path
or that path?

33:57.165 --> 34:00.623
Up here, she was able
to quiet her mind

34:00.735 --> 34:03.670
and open her heart.

34:04.005 --> 34:06.803
She learned the answers
were inside of her.

34:06.908 --> 34:10.400
Not out there somewhere,
but in here.

34:10.512 --> 34:12.070
She just had to trust herself.

34:13.581 --> 34:16.208
Your mom was
a courageous woman, Amy.

34:18.286 --> 34:20.982
Her spirit lives on in you.

34:22.424 --> 34:24.152
This medicine helped her let go

34:24.259 --> 34:27.956
of those things she didn't need
to be carrying around in her heart.

34:32.067 --> 34:34.228
Maybe it'll help you, too.

35:31.659 --> 35:33.490
"My Dear Victor.

35:33.595 --> 35:35.688
How can I ever thank you
for helping me

35:35.797 --> 35:40.894
find my way back to my heart,
my gift, and my girls?

35:41.002 --> 35:43.334
I know what I have to do.

35:43.438 --> 35:46.100
Face my fears
of being a single mom

35:46.207 --> 35:49.574
and move on to the next chapter
of my life.

35:49.677 --> 35:51.076
I love you.

35:51.179 --> 35:52.976
Yours, Marion."

36:19.007 --> 36:19.666
Hey.

36:19.841 --> 36:20.773
Hey.

36:20.875 --> 36:22.638
Sorry to barge in.

36:25.447 --> 36:28.280
I've been trying to reach you all day.

36:28.450 --> 36:30.281
I wanted to...

36:30.385 --> 36:31.818
That thing I said,

36:31.920 --> 36:34.889
about you wanting to do things
Amy's way.

36:34.989 --> 36:36.183
Not cool.

36:38.626 --> 36:41.891
God, it's cold in here.

36:44.132 --> 36:48.398
Maybe we could warm things up.

36:50.472 --> 36:52.269
Kit.

36:52.407 --> 36:53.965
What?

36:57.412 --> 36:59.004
Are you breaking up with me?

37:00.815 --> 37:03.477
Is that why you've been
avoiding me all day?

37:03.618 --> 37:04.550
No.

37:04.652 --> 37:06.210
No. It's just...

37:06.321 --> 37:09.222
Just say it, Ty.

37:09.724 --> 37:11.214
This whole time
it's been Amy, right?

37:11.326 --> 37:13.317
No. Come on, Kit.

37:13.595 --> 37:15.722
I really like you.

37:15.830 --> 37:17.297
You're great.

37:17.398 --> 37:18.831
It's just...

37:18.933 --> 37:21.458
I think we should just be friends.

37:23.638 --> 37:24.662
I'm sorry.

37:25.807 --> 37:28.298
You're sorry?

37:28.409 --> 37:29.933
All this time,
you've been leading me on,

37:30.044 --> 37:31.375
and all you can say is "sorry"?

37:31.479 --> 37:32.377
No!

37:32.480 --> 37:36.075
No, Kit. I wish I had the right words
to explain it.

37:36.217 --> 37:38.515
I wish you would
just be honest with me.

37:40.688 --> 37:43.282
Why can't you be honest with me
instead of hurting me?

37:49.197 --> 37:50.721
Kit!

37:54.269 --> 37:55.395
[Horse whinnies]

37:59.274 --> 38:00.104
Spartan?

38:00.708 --> 38:02.573
[Horse whinnies]

38:03.111 --> 38:03.941
Spartan!

38:05.513 --> 38:07.572
Spartan!

38:10.318 --> 38:12.081
Spartan!

38:28.903 --> 38:32.464
You're okay. Good boy.

38:32.574 --> 38:34.235
Okay.

38:36.377 --> 38:38.504
Easy.

38:44.352 --> 38:45.182
Easy, Spartan.

38:51.726 --> 38:53.523
I don't know which way to go.

Good boy.

41:03.791 --> 41:04.780
Hey.

41:22.176 --> 41:25.634
So, why didn't Grandpa come?

41:26.080 --> 41:27.911
Well, I sort of wanted to...

41:28.015 --> 41:31.542
Not sort of wanted to.
I needed to.

41:32.153 --> 41:34.451
Well, it's not something
that I can just...

41:34.555 --> 41:39.424
Well, it just... It can't wait,

41:41.128 --> 41:43.528
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

Okay.

41:45.299 --> 41:47.767

41:47.869 --> 41:49.860
Something about looking
for his eagle.

Oh, right.
Okay. I'll be right back.
