01:53.073 --> 01:54.971
Hi.

01:54.973 --> 01:58.204
Um, whoever's watching,
I just wanted to say,

01:58.206 --> 02:01.171
if you are at the camp
and we're not back yet,

02:01.173 --> 02:03.305
that I just wanted to say
don't worry.

02:03.307 --> 02:05.937
Uh, the ascension is something
we've all been looking forward to

02:05.939 --> 02:08.336
and we couldn't be happier,

02:08.339 --> 02:10.237
so our round-trip from this
place and back

02:10.239 --> 02:12.238
is really something
to celebrate.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.604
So, um...

02:14.606 --> 02:17.470
eat and drink and make yourself
comfortable,

02:17.472 --> 02:22.070
and we look forward to seeing
you when we return.

02:22.072 --> 02:24.938
Um...

02:24.940 --> 02:28.873
Okay. Bye.

02:41.005 --> 02:43.137
You seriously spent
$20 on that

02:43.139 --> 02:44.338
and didn't get
the car battery?

02:44.340 --> 02:45.604
You said they did it
already.

02:45.606 --> 02:48.238
- Nope. No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.371
No. I said that
right before we left,

02:51.373 --> 02:54.536
I was told that they were all
were gonna kill themselves.

02:54.538 --> 02:57.570
And that's why we left
the cult.

02:57.572 --> 03:00.436
She didn't say anything about
killing themselves.

03:00.438 --> 03:02.137
She didn't.

03:02.139 --> 03:04.170
It's a UFO death cult.

03:04.172 --> 03:05.904
It's what they do.

03:05.906 --> 03:08.370
They just call it
something different.

03:08.372 --> 03:10.003
I rescued us from a cult.

03:10.005 --> 03:12.238
I saved you from mass suicide.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.341
You're welcome.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.204
The, uh, owner still gone?

03:28.206 --> 03:31.037
Yep. But be fast.

03:31.039 --> 03:33.837
You want, um, pork or shrimp?

03:33.839 --> 03:36.137
Uh, neither. I'm good.

03:36.139 --> 03:38.038
- You're not eating lunch?
- Nope.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.838
Gotta save the money you spent
on antique video equipment

03:40.840 --> 03:42.504
and not the car battery.

03:42.506 --> 03:44.237
Oh, tattoos, those were
an investment.

03:44.239 --> 03:46.406
What?

03:50.439 --> 03:55.437
You know they used to feed us
real food.

03:55.439 --> 04:01.540
You know, vegetables and fish
that's not powder.

04:03.207 --> 04:04.571
I'd rather be alive and eat
raman

04:04.573 --> 04:08.336
than be dead and eat...
corn.

04:08.338 --> 04:12.137
I know they were going to do
it, now they clearly are,

04:12.139 --> 04:14.871
so I was, like,
ten years off.

04:14.873 --> 04:16.938
They didn't say anything about
killing themselves.

04:16.940 --> 04:18.536
They said...
Move your head.

04:18.539 --> 04:20.870
They said they were going
somewhere,

04:20.872 --> 04:23.336
and we don't know how long or
where they were going...

04:23.338 --> 04:25.437
- Good.
- How's that good?

04:25.439 --> 04:27.070
If we were back at the camp,
we'd have, like,

04:27.072 --> 04:29.473
good food and support,
and we wouldn't be

04:30.503 --> 04:31.404
one dirty house away
from being homeless.

04:31.406 --> 04:33.038
I need the car.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.571
I've got deprogramming in, like,
half an hour. Ow.

04:35.573 --> 04:38.537
I don't want to go to
deprogramming anymore.

04:38.539 --> 04:40.337
Are you gonna be the one to
get another job

04:40.339 --> 04:42.269
if we don't qualify for aid?

04:42.271 --> 04:44.303
And stop leaving the dome light
on in the car.

04:44.305 --> 04:46.370
You're making the car battery
even worse if that's possible.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.571
It was mostly a joke.

04:59.573 --> 05:02.071
But, um...

05:02.073 --> 05:05.071
he's not happy.

05:05.073 --> 05:08.070
I heard him crying
the other night, again.

05:08.072 --> 05:11.137
And, um...

05:11.139 --> 05:16.970
the cult sent us
a good-bye video.

05:16.972 --> 05:20.403
Whoa. What was that like?

05:20.405 --> 05:22.904
I mean, I was relieved,
at first,

05:22.906 --> 05:27.536
because... they're not dead.

05:27.538 --> 05:30.137
And then I felt bad.

05:30.139 --> 05:32.138
Because now Aaron thinks
I pulled him out

05:32.140 --> 05:35.103
all those years ago
for no reason.

05:35.105 --> 05:38.103
All of his memories
of the cult

05:38.105 --> 05:42.038
are as a kid or a teenager
or whatever.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.503
So all those memories
are good,

05:43.505 --> 05:47.537
and he sees our lives here
as horrible.

05:47.539 --> 05:50.137
But, to me,

05:50.139 --> 05:53.236
the thing that makes our lives
here better

05:53.238 --> 05:56.138
is thinking for ourselves.

05:56.140 --> 05:58.037
And I don't know why we haven't
been able

05:58.039 --> 06:02.904
to make a living
or make friends...

06:02.906 --> 06:04.507
meet girls.

06:07.539 --> 06:11.937
Recovery from cult mind
control is a lifelong process,

06:11.939 --> 06:15.971
and if he resents you for
pulling him out,

06:15.973 --> 06:17.236
that's common.

06:17.238 --> 06:20.469
Whether he resents me
or he doesn't,

06:20.471 --> 06:23.937
feeling responsible for
his well-being 24/7

06:23.939 --> 06:26.172
is exhausting.

06:32.338 --> 06:34.938
They're gonna take the car.

06:34.940 --> 06:37.504
The credit card was
a bad idea.

06:37.506 --> 06:39.037
I'll figure it out.

06:39.039 --> 06:40.840
Yeah, okay.

06:49.605 --> 06:51.204
I wanna go back.

06:51.206 --> 06:53.503
Have fun with that.

06:53.505 --> 06:55.436
No, I'm serious.

06:55.438 --> 06:57.907
I'm going,
just... for a visit.

07:01.538 --> 07:03.071
You have a horrible memory.

07:03.073 --> 07:04.537
That place is not
what you think it is.

07:04.539 --> 07:07.140
- I know.
- Great. Let's not go.

07:19.438 --> 07:21.439
Why do you wanna go back?

07:23.239 --> 07:25.536
We can say good-bye.

07:25.538 --> 07:27.239
Get some closure.

07:29.171 --> 07:31.405
They were our family.

07:48.339 --> 07:52.136
One day.
One night.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.871
We come straight back.

07:53.873 --> 07:58.837
Will that make you
feel better?

07:58.839 --> 08:01.137
Uh...

08:01.139 --> 08:03.603
Because if that'll get you
out of this slump,

08:03.605 --> 08:06.172
we can go back.

08:07.972 --> 08:09.270
I mean, he's trying.

08:09.272 --> 08:11.403
He's trying lots of things,
but...

08:11.405 --> 08:14.871
this one time,
by some miracle,

08:14.873 --> 08:16.270
we met these girls
at the park,

08:16.272 --> 08:20.137
and he takes 'em to this
cheap Mexican food place,

08:20.139 --> 08:21.604
down by the apartment.

08:21.606 --> 08:24.337
And, out of, like...

08:24.339 --> 08:25.971
out of, like,
nervousness or something,

08:25.973 --> 08:30.137
he's like, "I'm an ex-UFO
death cult member."

08:30.139 --> 08:33.102
And she's like, "Okay, I have
to go to the bathroom."

08:33.105 --> 08:35.169
And she obviously never
comes back.

08:35.172 --> 08:37.405
And her friend never
returned my calls.

08:40.205 --> 08:41.971
But that's him, though,
you know?

08:41.972 --> 08:44.203
Uh...

08:44.206 --> 08:46.370
He's trying to do
the right thing.

08:46.372 --> 08:48.537
He really is.

08:48.539 --> 08:53.204
But it has to be his way...

08:53.206 --> 08:55.469
which never works.

08:55.471 --> 08:58.469
And so the only thing that's
worse than this shitty life

08:58.471 --> 09:01.004
he's built for us is having
no fucking control over it.

09:01.006 --> 09:03.106
I'm sorry.

09:05.005 --> 09:07.269
Have you talked
to him about this?

09:07.271 --> 09:09.871
No, no, he's my brother.

09:09.873 --> 09:12.070
And you're
sure it's a good idea

09:12.072 --> 09:13.304
to go back to the cult?

09:13.306 --> 09:15.203
It's not a cult.

09:15.205 --> 09:17.937
It's a commune.

09:17.939 --> 09:22.336
Uniforms. Redefining words.

09:22.338 --> 09:26.403
Calling death "ascension."

09:26.405 --> 09:29.169
Worshipping a deity
in the forest

09:29.171 --> 09:32.204
that no one else knows about.

09:32.206 --> 09:35.070
And...

09:35.072 --> 09:37.006
castration.

09:38.339 --> 09:40.169
Okay, yeah, that's a cult.

09:40.171 --> 09:43.136
But I actually don't remember
any of those things.

09:43.138 --> 09:49.504
I just remember, like, bonfires,
family time, and good food.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.604
It's wasn't like they were
keeping us prisoner or anything.

09:51.606 --> 09:53.136
Actually, hang on a second.

09:53.138 --> 09:54.903
If they were gonna be, like,

09:54.905 --> 09:56.469
pointing machine guns at our
heads

09:56.471 --> 09:58.537
and make us drink cyanide
Kool-Aid,

09:58.539 --> 10:01.536
why would you be driving us
there right now?

10:01.538 --> 10:04.470
All right, I never saw
anything specifically like that.

10:04.472 --> 10:08.203
But in your distorted memory,
we were, like...

10:08.205 --> 10:11.536
petting deer and dancing with
koalas.

10:11.538 --> 10:13.303
We were, I remember that.

10:13.305 --> 10:14.969
Boobs.

10:14.971 --> 10:17.571
Ah, the boobs.

10:20.471 --> 10:24.070
♪ There is a house
in New Orleans ♪

10:24.072 --> 10:26.570

10:29.206 --> 10:31.437

10:46.972 --> 10:50.469
Hey, Mom. I know we don't
visit much, but...

10:50.471 --> 10:54.469
I just wanted to say I'm doing
my best to take care of him.

10:54.471 --> 10:56.571
What?

10:56.573 --> 10:59.036
What?

10:59.038 --> 11:01.102
- Nothing.
- I heard you.

11:01.104 --> 11:03.269
No, you didn't.

11:03.271 --> 11:05.903
- You becoming religious?
- No.

11:05.905 --> 11:07.436
You're praying to her grave.

11:07.438 --> 11:09.404
It's not a grave,
it's a memoriam.

11:09.406 --> 11:11.203
Ah, talking to a memoriam.

11:11.205 --> 11:14.838
That's totally not praying
to a grave.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.037
That's sweet. I think someone's
been by or something.

11:17.039 --> 11:18.902
Look. It's brand-new.

11:18.904 --> 11:21.571
No, we actually made that from
when we were little

11:21.573 --> 11:23.469
because she liked to paint.

11:23.471 --> 11:26.837
Wow, that really held up.

11:38.605 --> 11:41.571
What the heck are those?

11:41.573 --> 11:44.837
It's like a volcanic
event,

11:44.839 --> 11:47.237
hundreds of thousands
of years ago.

11:47.239 --> 11:50.604
And then erosion or...

11:50.606 --> 11:52.440
something.

12:20.938 --> 12:22.937
Hey, mind of I drive
for a bit?

12:22.939 --> 12:24.436
Nah, I'll just go
the rest of the way.

12:24.438 --> 12:26.102
You drove the whole way.
I wanna drive.

12:26.104 --> 12:28.372
I'm driving.
Get in.

13:37.971 --> 13:39.905
Not a cult at all.

14:05.072 --> 14:07.570
Smells good.

14:07.572 --> 14:10.105
Smells like the barley.

14:14.439 --> 14:16.440
Hey!

14:24.271 --> 14:27.069
Good to see you two.

14:27.071 --> 14:28.903
What the dickens bring you
all the way out here?

14:28.905 --> 14:34.070
Just thought we'd visit while
you're, uh... here.

14:34.072 --> 14:36.306
We're always here.

14:38.439 --> 14:40.337
You hungry?

14:40.339 --> 14:42.169
I'm always hungry.

14:42.171 --> 14:44.106
Let's get you fed.

14:57.305 --> 14:59.506
You boys remember Tim,
right?

15:01.573 --> 15:03.469
- How's it going, Tim?
- Hey.

15:03.471 --> 15:05.570
You gotta try Tim's
new Hefeweizen.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.170
It is delicious.

15:08.172 --> 15:12.037
Whoa! I didn't know you guys
were gonna be here.

15:12.039 --> 15:14.069
It's good to see you guys!

15:14.071 --> 15:15.836
- Shane, Anna.
- Hi!

15:15.838 --> 15:18.304
This is weird. Aaron is, like,
all grown up.

15:18.306 --> 15:20.404
Do you remember me?

15:20.406 --> 15:22.273
Yeah, a little.

15:26.338 --> 15:28.369
So, you all look, uh...

15:28.371 --> 15:29.837
Healthy?

15:29.839 --> 15:33.369
Fresh food, air, and ale.

15:33.371 --> 15:35.069
That'll do it.

15:35.071 --> 15:37.137
I was gonna say
exactly the same.

15:37.139 --> 15:39.937
- This is amazing.
- Thank you.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.369
Shane and Anna, they grew
the barley for that batch,

15:42.371 --> 15:45.037
so they deserve credit.

15:45.039 --> 15:49.069
- Tim, his beer, is our most profitable export.
- Yeah.

15:49.071 --> 15:51.070
Oh! You boys haven't met Lizzy.

15:51.072 --> 15:53.469
It's nice to finally
meet you two.

15:53.471 --> 15:55.872
Everyone says all kinds
of stuff about you.

15:57.272 --> 15:59.869
Thanks. Uh, how'd you
end up here?

15:59.871 --> 16:02.870
I was at a mental health
facility up the road,

16:02.872 --> 16:05.204
and I use to wander out
quite a bit.

16:05.206 --> 16:08.036
And on one of my wanderings,
I met Tim

16:08.038 --> 16:11.239
and just realized
I'm better here.

16:15.239 --> 16:18.437
You boys remember Dave,
right?

16:18.439 --> 16:21.006
Hey.

16:22.604 --> 16:26.204
You know, Lizzy,
she's a great artist.

16:26.206 --> 16:29.003
Actually, her sketches,
they kind of remind me

16:29.005 --> 16:30.204
of your photography,
Justin.

16:30.206 --> 16:31.270
Oh, yeah.

16:31.272 --> 16:33.336
You were a photographer?

16:33.338 --> 16:35.070
Um, not really.

16:35.072 --> 16:36.404
It's when you were really
little.

16:36.406 --> 16:37.970
He was really good.

16:37.972 --> 16:41.069
Well, could have been,
given time.

16:41.071 --> 16:43.070
It's like Shane's
magic tricks.

16:43.072 --> 16:45.204
I'm all right.
It's a million hours, right?

16:45.206 --> 16:47.570
- Man, I hope so.
- A million hours?

16:47.572 --> 16:49.336
Yeah, a million hours is the
amount of time

16:49.338 --> 16:51.203
it takes to actually master
something.

16:51.205 --> 16:54.269
So, if you live to be
115 years old

16:54.271 --> 16:55.970
and you spend your waking,
sleeping moments

16:55.972 --> 16:57.970
just dedicated to one thing,
then...

16:57.972 --> 17:00.203
yeah, mastery is
a possibility.

17:00.205 --> 17:02.372
Absolutely.

17:06.506 --> 17:08.372
That's mine.

17:10.871 --> 17:13.170
You think Anna and Shane
are together?

17:13.172 --> 17:15.336
Well, they're all castrated.

17:15.338 --> 17:17.602
So do you mean, like,
emotionally?

17:17.604 --> 17:19.204
They don't seem castrated.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.368
You don't know how castrated
people act.

17:21.371 --> 17:24.336
And you realize she's, like,
20 years older than you.

17:24.338 --> 17:26.270
- No, she's not.
- Yes.

17:26.271 --> 17:27.469
- No.
- Yeah.

17:27.471 --> 17:30.103
They're all in, like, their 40s.
They just look young.

17:30.105 --> 17:31.970
It's weird.

17:31.972 --> 17:34.836
They just look like they take
care of themselves

17:34.838 --> 17:37.372
and don't eat dirty garbage
food.

17:40.071 --> 17:42.472
Taking a nap?

17:44.104 --> 17:48.340
I... am gonna go for a run.

19:11.438 --> 19:13.505
Hey!

19:35.105 --> 19:37.436
Uh, okay, actually, I've been
working on this one.

19:37.438 --> 19:39.870
Pick a card, any card.

19:39.872 --> 19:42.403
No, no, no, no.

19:42.405 --> 19:46.206
He's just gonna keep picking
the same one.

19:50.839 --> 19:53.439
I don't wanna touch the card.
Okay, just put it on top.

20:11.405 --> 20:15.103
Can I show you something
back in my cabin?

20:15.105 --> 20:18.369
Um... right now?

20:18.371 --> 20:20.438
Unless you know
a better time.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.905
Sure.

20:40.839 --> 20:42.838
Try this one.

20:47.939 --> 20:49.936
It's interesting.

20:49.938 --> 20:53.170
Did a small batch.
Thinking about doing a big run.

20:53.172 --> 20:55.140
That Tim, he is good.

21:01.605 --> 21:05.239
You, uh...
you figure it out yet?

21:07.438 --> 21:10.336
Not yet.

21:10.338 --> 21:12.402
Eventually, though.

21:12.404 --> 21:15.969
Sometimes I wish I wasn't so
damned left-brained.

21:15.971 --> 21:20.170
It either is or it
isn't and...

21:20.172 --> 21:23.873
this equation isn't...
yet.

21:25.171 --> 21:28.137
All right.

21:28.139 --> 21:29.502
I gotta ask.

21:29.504 --> 21:31.872
What's it solve?

21:33.904 --> 21:36.172
Wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

21:47.304 --> 21:51.170
I like that everyone here kind of
has a little thing that they do.

21:51.172 --> 21:53.436
Yeah. I mean, some people have
two or three,

21:53.438 --> 21:55.773
but, yeah, everybody has
at least one. Yeah.

22:01.571 --> 22:03.503
So, you're like
the clothing designer?

22:03.505 --> 22:05.436
You do the camp's clothes?

22:05.438 --> 22:07.102
Yeah, yeah.

22:07.104 --> 22:09.136
I mean, I make a lot of
stuff from scratch, but I...

22:09.138 --> 22:11.570
you know, whatever I can find
at thrift stores and...

22:11.572 --> 22:12.902
That's where I got this.

22:12.904 --> 22:14.869
Yeah.

22:14.871 --> 22:18.170
I used to make a lot of your
clothes. Do you remember that?

22:18.172 --> 22:20.402
No. I mean...

22:20.404 --> 22:22.468
I'm sorry. It's just been
a long time. Sorry.

22:22.470 --> 22:25.070
Yeah.

22:25.072 --> 22:27.039
Do you wanna see some
of my new designs?

22:28.605 --> 22:32.335
Listen, uh, I just wanted
to tell you again

22:32.337 --> 22:35.602
that everything you did,

22:35.604 --> 22:38.838
it ranges from "I don't care"
to "All is forgiven."

22:41.904 --> 22:44.936
Now, that being said,

22:44.938 --> 22:48.136
why come back now?

22:48.138 --> 22:51.137
The video you sent.

22:51.139 --> 22:53.137
What video?

22:53.139 --> 22:54.903
The video.

22:54.905 --> 22:58.303
With Anna talking about...

22:58.305 --> 23:00.006
the end.

23:06.204 --> 23:09.471
Never been a suicide on this
property that I'm aware of.

23:12.304 --> 23:17.106
In fact, I can assure you that
nothing here ends.

23:19.105 --> 23:23.302
All that happens here is that
people live long and healthy lives.

23:23.304 --> 23:25.569
Because of that,
they grow to be

23:25.571 --> 23:28.902
the people they want to be.

23:28.904 --> 23:32.105
Pretty simple.

23:34.871 --> 23:37.972
There is something bigger
than us out here.

23:39.604 --> 23:43.603
And now that you're both at an
age where you can understand it,

23:43.605 --> 23:46.103
it'll become...

23:46.105 --> 23:48.806
evident.

23:51.405 --> 23:53.806
All right. Uh...

23:56.105 --> 23:58.902
All right.

23:58.904 --> 24:00.972
I'll get you another beer.

24:11.504 --> 24:13.903
- You ready?
- Yeah.

24:13.905 --> 24:17.870
- Ta-da.
- Oh, whoa.

24:17.872 --> 24:19.503
These are good.

24:19.505 --> 24:21.235
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:21.237 --> 24:23.202
Wait. What do you
and Justin do?

24:23.204 --> 24:26.503
Um... we clean.

24:26.505 --> 24:27.937
Impressive?

24:27.939 --> 24:29.235
Didn't you used to like
to fish?

24:29.237 --> 24:33.002
Yeah, you know,
when I was a kid, but...

24:33.004 --> 24:36.902
I don't think I even remember
how to tie a fishing knot.

24:36.904 --> 24:38.304
You know?

24:40.103 --> 24:42.903
Uh, do you get paid for this?

24:42.905 --> 24:44.939
What, for being
alone with you?

24:47.038 --> 24:48.570
Come on!

24:48.572 --> 24:50.168
Yes, of course!

24:50.170 --> 24:52.435
I mean, the money comes
from the beer, but...

24:52.437 --> 24:55.503
yeah, we all get paid for
everything we do.

24:55.505 --> 24:58.172
So you never have to leave?

25:02.905 --> 25:05.602
All right.
Black ace.

25:05.604 --> 25:07.937
Just focus on these angels here
for a second.

25:07.939 --> 25:09.403
One, two...

25:09.405 --> 25:12.036
So we got your red from
earlier, right?

25:12.038 --> 25:14.169
And with this little...

25:14.171 --> 25:15.369
black, yeah.

25:15.371 --> 25:17.737
I think I see
what you're doing.

25:21.605 --> 25:24.202
Come here.
You're gonna pick a card.

25:24.204 --> 25:26.939
Come on.

25:40.571 --> 25:43.204
Take a look at it.

25:45.971 --> 25:48.304
Put it back in
wherever you want.

25:50.070 --> 25:51.105
Very good.

26:04.138 --> 26:05.806
Is that your card?

26:08.205 --> 26:10.472
No.

26:13.505 --> 26:15.168
Have you seen Aaron?

26:15.170 --> 26:18.969
Yeah, he's in Anna's cabin
with her.

26:18.971 --> 26:20.902
You all right with that?

26:20.904 --> 26:23.439
Why wouldn't I be
all right with that?

26:26.271 --> 26:28.403
You wanna see another trick?

26:28.405 --> 26:30.236
Come on, just humor me.

26:30.238 --> 26:32.806
It's a new one I'm working on.
Come on.

26:56.003 --> 26:58.472
Relax. Relax.

27:07.137 --> 27:10.004
All right! Who's
ready for The Struggle?

27:41.071 --> 27:42.602
Hey, why doesn't Dave talk?

27:42.604 --> 27:44.435
Brain injury.

27:44.437 --> 27:47.536
Hal says he fell off a building
while working construction,

27:47.538 --> 27:50.901
and Tim told me it was
self-trephination.

27:50.903 --> 27:54.502
You drill a hole in your skull
so you stay permanently high.

27:54.504 --> 27:57.303
He drilled too far.

27:57.305 --> 28:00.602
Ladies and gentlemen,
for most of you,

28:00.604 --> 28:03.036
this requires no explanation.

28:03.038 --> 28:05.536
But we have many
traditions here at Camp Arcadia,

28:05.538 --> 28:09.436
none more prominent than
The Struggle.

28:13.304 --> 28:17.402
We have the struggle
with passion!

28:17.404 --> 28:21.235
The struggle for growth!

28:21.237 --> 28:26.001
The struggle with
a higher power!

28:26.003 --> 28:28.836
Smiling Dave on a ladder.

28:28.838 --> 28:30.368
And...

28:30.370 --> 28:33.435
And...

28:33.437 --> 28:35.335
What, Anna?

28:35.337 --> 28:39.570
That would be all of which
we overcome with perseverance.

28:39.572 --> 28:41.502
You're the one
who invented this,

28:41.504 --> 28:43.835
so why am I always the one
looking ridiculous emceeing it?

28:43.837 --> 28:46.135
Because I'm reigning champion,
that's why.

28:49.237 --> 28:52.569
That you are.

28:52.571 --> 28:55.135
Whoo!
I need a breather.

28:55.137 --> 28:57.037
Who's next?

28:59.437 --> 29:01.838
Come on, who's next?

29:05.371 --> 29:07.139
Aaron?

29:09.904 --> 29:12.036
Nah. I'm good.
Next time. Thank you.

29:12.038 --> 29:14.503
Come on.

29:14.505 --> 29:16.303
What do you say, guys,
can we get him up here?

29:16.305 --> 29:19.168
- Come on, man!
- Come on!

29:19.170 --> 29:21.302
Let's go!

29:24.505 --> 29:26.205
There you go.

29:48.571 --> 29:51.268
It's all right.
It's all right.

29:54.470 --> 29:56.304
Can I go again?

29:58.370 --> 30:00.172
We never give up.

30:44.838 --> 30:47.202
All right!
Whoo!

30:50.404 --> 30:53.468
First man to use
a fishing knot

30:53.470 --> 30:56.136
in The Struggle is victorious!

31:00.238 --> 31:02.838
Who's next?

31:06.405 --> 31:08.072
Justin?

31:11.305 --> 31:16.102
I'm sorry. I really don't
want to right now.

31:16.104 --> 31:17.439
You sure?

31:26.104 --> 31:28.105
All right.

32:23.437 --> 32:27.436
Thank you, Lizzy, but I could
really just do this myself.

32:27.438 --> 32:29.101
No, it's fine.

32:29.103 --> 32:31.035
I used to clean up sores for
this gun-nut tweaker guy

32:31.037 --> 32:34.236
out in the woods,
so this is nothing.

32:34.238 --> 32:38.002
Sounds like it's a good thing
you're not seeing him anymore.

32:38.004 --> 32:39.968
Oh, we weren't dating.

32:39.970 --> 32:42.403
He was just this guy I was sort
of obsessed with

32:42.405 --> 32:47.139
when I was on lithium,
thorazine, and PCP.

32:49.304 --> 32:51.036
Hey.

32:51.038 --> 32:53.135
Thanks for being
such a good sport.

32:53.137 --> 32:55.335
I did not mean at all
for that to happen.

32:55.337 --> 32:58.136
I just never understood
the point of that.

32:58.138 --> 32:59.569
Just silly little metaphors,
you know.

32:59.571 --> 33:01.101
Brings the party together.

33:01.103 --> 33:03.236
Frankly, it's a little
embarrassing.

33:03.238 --> 33:05.506
All better.

33:11.170 --> 33:13.837
You two have some fun.

33:25.037 --> 33:27.369
All right. I'm actually
pretty tired.

33:27.371 --> 33:30.405
So I'll see you two
in the morning.

33:32.171 --> 33:34.102
Hey, seriously.

33:34.104 --> 33:35.835
Thanks for doing this.

33:35.837 --> 33:38.836
I'm just happy you get to see
how insane it all is.

33:38.838 --> 33:40.902
Yeah, it's pretty weird.

33:40.904 --> 33:45.169
But, uh, I was thinking.
Could we stay for one more day?

33:45.171 --> 33:47.101
- You're drunk.
- No.

33:47.103 --> 33:49.302
You are drunk. You smell like
a Long Island Iced Tea.

33:49.304 --> 33:52.236
You're drunk.

33:52.238 --> 33:55.968
Can we just stay through
tomorrow night?

33:55.970 --> 33:57.435
You know, I was talking to Anna.

33:57.437 --> 34:00.535
She said that Hal lets people
take his guns out.

34:00.537 --> 34:05.235
We could just kinda...
hang out in the wilderness.

34:05.237 --> 34:07.835
Shoot guns, just you and me,
you know?

34:07.837 --> 34:10.402
Despite all this weirdness, just
kind of enjoy something for once.

34:10.404 --> 34:13.036
I really don't wanna do that.

34:13.038 --> 34:16.502
It doesn't cost anything.

34:16.504 --> 34:20.071
All right. I'll let you
stay one more day.

34:28.103 --> 34:30.835
Hey, Tim.

34:30.837 --> 34:32.772
What's in there?

34:34.904 --> 34:37.105
Brewing equipment.

34:43.371 --> 34:46.504
Until the FBI shows up.

34:58.305 --> 35:01.369
Hey, you asleep?

35:01.371 --> 35:03.871
Hmm?

35:05.271 --> 35:07.169
I was.

35:07.171 --> 35:09.836
And now all I wanna do
is talk to you.

35:09.838 --> 35:14.569
Seriously. Did anything
happen with Anna?

35:14.571 --> 35:16.368
Honestly, no.

35:16.370 --> 35:19.336
Well, she gave me this look
that made me think,

35:19.338 --> 35:22.836
you know, maybe she wanted to
hold hands or something.

35:22.838 --> 35:26.105
- Nice.
- Yeah.

35:33.304 --> 35:37.336
Hey, I really think that
you should have this.

35:37.338 --> 35:39.935
I really think
it's good for you.

35:39.937 --> 35:43.434
But I also think that
you should know

35:43.436 --> 35:45.869
that when you were little,

35:45.871 --> 35:49.205
Anna used to, like,
make eyes at you.

35:51.270 --> 35:53.101
Yeah, it's probably because

35:53.103 --> 35:55.868
she's always been
in love with me.

35:55.870 --> 35:59.937
And we were meant to
be together.

36:02.004 --> 36:04.836
Or maybe she's a pedophile.

36:04.838 --> 36:06.602
Women can't be
a pedophiles.

36:06.604 --> 36:08.534
- Yes, they can.
- No, they can't.

36:08.536 --> 36:10.236
- Yes, they can.
- No, they can't.

36:10.238 --> 36:12.035
Are you, like, redefining
the word pedophile?

36:12.037 --> 36:14.937
- In order for a man to have intercourse...
- Go to sleep.

36:17.504 --> 36:19.871
- In order...
- Go to sleep.

36:25.071 --> 36:27.069
- Women can't...

Make sure you clean that

36:49.337 --> 36:52.169
He gets pretty mad if you give
it back dirty.

36:52.171 --> 36:53.602
I can't really imagine
him angry.

36:55.470 --> 36:57.302
I can.

36:59.536 --> 37:01.434
So your thing was photography?

37:01.436 --> 37:04.337
Nah. I don't really have
a thing yet.

37:19.137 --> 37:21.337
I guess hunting wasn't
your thing either.

37:24.370 --> 37:25.771

37:45.403 --> 37:48.367
Seriously, what do you

37:48.369 --> 37:50.904

Oh, sure you can.

41:33.369 --> 41:36.435
Hey, uh, do you have
a minute?

41:36.437 --> 41:39.568
And it was like...

41:39.570 --> 41:43.167
something was there.

41:43.169 --> 41:46.501
But-but that I couldn't see.

41:46.503 --> 41:50.901
And it left me this...
I think.

41:50.903 --> 41:52.134
Maybe.

41:52.136 --> 41:54.935
It's like I said.

41:54.937 --> 41:57.901
You're at an age now where you
can become a part of it.

41:57.903 --> 42:00.101
So it's gonna be
more apparent.

42:00.103 --> 42:02.168
Yeah, but you always
speak in metaphors.

42:02.170 --> 42:04.235
So you don't trust me?

42:04.237 --> 42:06.002
And you're gonna stand there,
you're gonna tell me

42:06.004 --> 42:09.002
that you have never experienced
anything before?

42:09.004 --> 42:12.368
I mean, I remember some things
from when I was a kid,

42:12.370 --> 42:15.434
but kids have imaginations,

42:15.436 --> 42:20.367
and as a grown man now, I guess
the reason why

42:20.369 --> 42:23.935
I sort of dramatically asked you
to come out here

42:23.937 --> 42:26.501
is for you to just tell me,

42:26.503 --> 42:30.134
in your own words,

42:30.136 --> 42:33.838
what is it?

42:35.838 --> 42:38.302
Who's the leader here, Justin?

42:38.304 --> 42:40.938
Uh, you?

42:43.837 --> 42:45.067
There's never been one.

42:45.069 --> 42:47.902
I just talk more.

42:47.904 --> 42:50.968
It's not a very flattering
quality, if you ask me,

42:50.970 --> 42:54.435
but one of the things that
I talk a lot about

42:54.437 --> 42:57.135
is that I don't have answers.

42:57.137 --> 42:59.901
None of us do.

42:59.903 --> 43:03.935
You wanna know what it is that
runs all this?

43:03.937 --> 43:06.771
You go find it.

43:17.969 --> 43:21.201
How is that possible?

43:21.203 --> 43:23.935
It's crazy, right?

43:23.937 --> 43:27.335
Some kind of atmospheric
mirroring effect.

43:27.337 --> 43:30.502
It's like the Northern Lights.

43:30.504 --> 43:32.502
Anyway, two moons brings
a truth.

43:32.504 --> 43:35.301
Three signifies the ascension.

43:35.303 --> 43:38.135
All right, that just all
sounds like metaphor again.

43:38.137 --> 43:40.001
I know, I know.

43:40.003 --> 43:41.868
You know that physics equation
in my room?

43:41.870 --> 43:45.335
- Yeah.
- That's what it is to me.

43:45.337 --> 43:48.067
And I still haven't
finished that.

43:48.069 --> 43:50.335
But what I can tell you,

43:50.337 --> 43:53.001
is if you and Aaron,
you stay one more day,

43:53.003 --> 43:55.135
you go fishing in the lake,

43:55.137 --> 43:57.535
and you go out
to this buoy,

43:57.537 --> 44:02.901
you dive straight down and you
grab what you find there.

44:02.903 --> 44:05.001
You're gonna have
your answer.

44:05.003 --> 44:07.001
You know how culty
that sounds, right?

44:07.003 --> 44:10.502
Confirm this thing
for yourself...

44:10.504 --> 44:12.935
and you've gotta admit it.

44:12.937 --> 44:15.435
There it is.

44:15.437 --> 44:17.402
A higher power?

44:17.404 --> 44:20.468
A governing force?
God?

44:20.470 --> 44:22.370
Infinity solved.

44:24.470 --> 44:28.134
Now, wouldn't that be
a weight off your shoulders?

44:28.136 --> 44:33.167
And if you like having that
weight gone,

44:33.169 --> 44:37.035
you and Aaron have
a home here.

44:37.037 --> 44:40.971
Even after the third moon.

44:47.070 --> 44:49.267
Aaron, get on up here.

44:49.269 --> 44:51.568
Get on up there!

44:51.570 --> 44:54.168
Get on!
Whoo!

44:54.170 --> 44:55.970
Ow!

44:58.336 --> 45:00.035
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

45:00.037 --> 45:01.235

45:45.436 --> 45:48.569
You call that red stuff
"the flower," right?

45:48.571 --> 45:51.037
Yeah.

45:54.436 --> 45:57.601
This has been
really good for me.

45:57.603 --> 45:59.936
Well, it's not over yet.

46:01.337 --> 46:03.202
Okay.

46:03.204 --> 46:05.334
So I happen to have
this other talent

46:05.336 --> 46:07.568
that's not making clothes
where I can measure

46:07.570 --> 46:11.234
the exact amount of drugs in my
lungs at any given time.

46:11.236 --> 46:13.968
If I were to measure out an
exact amount for you

46:13.970 --> 46:16.900
that won't make you feel
weird or sick

46:16.902 --> 46:19.101
or paranoid or anything
like that,

46:19.103 --> 46:21.267
would that be something that
you're interested in?

46:21.269 --> 46:22.867
Uh...

46:22.869 --> 46:24.402
And there's no pressure
at all. I'm not...

46:24.404 --> 46:26.000
No. No, let's do it.

46:26.002 --> 46:28.201
- Really?
- Let's do it. Come on.

46:28.203 --> 46:29.569
Come on, before I...

46:29.571 --> 46:32.204
Just follow my lead.
Okay, hold on.

46:34.537 --> 46:35.904
Come here.

46:58.537 --> 47:00.067
How do I know
when I'm high?

47:00.069 --> 47:02.601
Come here. Come walk with me.
I'll show you.

47:02.603 --> 47:05.100
You know, Tolkien said it,
Lewis said it,

47:05.102 --> 47:07.334
Lovecraft perverted it,

47:07.336 --> 47:11.000
and we just take the definite
face off of it

47:11.002 --> 47:12.967
and we just say, "Hey, here are
the tools,

47:12.969 --> 47:15.302
but you make it what you want."

47:15.304 --> 47:16.636
Totally. And the interesting
thing about that is

47:16.638 --> 47:20.037
when you look at things like the Hopi...

47:24.536 --> 47:27.201
It's the gun-nut
tweaker guy.

47:27.203 --> 47:30.537
Yeah, that looks like
a gun-nut tweaker.

48:06.137 --> 48:09.467
How is that possible?

48:09.469 --> 48:13.201
It's like a...
like a heat blur.

48:13.203 --> 48:15.235
You know, it's a natural
illusion.

48:15.237 --> 48:18.268
It has to do with solar winds

48:18.270 --> 48:23.035
and magnetic poles and...

48:23.037 --> 48:25.167
Um...

48:25.169 --> 48:27.335
No. I have no idea.

48:27.337 --> 48:29.000
Nobody in the camp does,

48:29.002 --> 48:32.068
but they're all around the camp
in a perfect circle.

48:32.070 --> 48:34.468
It's why we use a circle emblem.

48:34.470 --> 48:37.168
You usually need the flower to
see it this clearly.

48:37.170 --> 48:40.235
Is the reflection solid?
Can you go through it?

48:40.237 --> 48:41.937
Hmm.

48:44.836 --> 48:47.836
This is why you sent me
that video.

48:49.303 --> 48:51.000
What?

48:51.002 --> 48:55.968
The video you sent us talking
about the ascension.

48:55.970 --> 48:58.335
No, I didn't.

48:58.337 --> 49:00.302
I mean, yes, I made videos in
case you or my sister

49:00.304 --> 49:02.268
or someone came back to the
camp and we weren't here,

49:02.270 --> 49:05.268
but, no, I didn't.

49:05.270 --> 49:06.967
I didn't send that.

49:06.969 --> 49:09.034
That's really strange because we
all kind of agreed

49:09.036 --> 49:11.268
that we wouldn't share things
like that,

49:11.270 --> 49:14.471
especially after your brother,
you know?

49:17.003 --> 49:18.371
My brother what?

49:22.836 --> 49:25.000
I'm having such a nice time
with you.

49:25.002 --> 49:26.568
I'm so glad you're back.

49:26.570 --> 49:28.302
It's just we don't need
to talk about it.

49:28.304 --> 49:29.337
Okay.

49:48.037 --> 49:50.437
Do you hear music?

49:59.204 --> 50:02.901
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

50:02.903 --> 50:05.034
Are you all right?

50:05.036 --> 50:08.234
I'm fine. I just can't sleep
with everybody up like this.

50:08.236 --> 50:10.435
And I leave these notes
fucking everywhere

50:10.437 --> 50:13.835
saying, please, please, please
shut the hell up!

50:13.837 --> 50:17.601
You, uh...
you don't like the parties?

50:17.603 --> 50:21.867
I did for a few nights,
but after a while...

50:21.869 --> 50:23.171
fuck, man!

50:26.503 --> 50:27.968
What's your name?

50:27.970 --> 50:29.402
Justin.

50:29.404 --> 50:32.568
I'm Jennifer.

50:32.570 --> 50:34.402
Hey, Jennifer.

50:34.404 --> 50:38.771
So if you don't like it here,
why don't you just leave?

50:40.535 --> 50:43.067
It's a really weird story.

50:43.069 --> 50:45.501
You sure you wanna hear it?

50:45.503 --> 50:48.202
It's possible you're the only
woman here

50:48.204 --> 50:49.600
not taken by several men,

50:49.602 --> 50:53.267
so you'd have to convince
me otherwise.

50:53.269 --> 50:56.533
I'm not hitting on you. That was
mostly me making a joke.

50:56.535 --> 50:59.334
I'm 100 percent married, so...

50:59.336 --> 51:01.534
Right.
Very nice to meet you.

51:01.536 --> 51:04.367
No, it's fine.
You're...

51:04.369 --> 51:06.867
You're all harmless.

51:06.869 --> 51:10.000
A little brainwashed
but mostly harmless.

51:10.002 --> 51:12.103
So you're not part
of the camp?

51:15.303 --> 51:19.167
My husband Mike
disappeared near here.

51:19.169 --> 51:22.270
So I came out
looking for him.

51:23.570 --> 51:26.467
He just sort of lost it.

51:26.469 --> 51:30.601
And I wandered until I almost
passed out.

51:30.603 --> 51:33.204
Must have been dehydration
or something.

51:35.102 --> 51:38.302
Hal found me.

51:38.304 --> 51:41.368
He said we'd find him.

51:41.370 --> 51:43.771
It'd take some time...

51:46.069 --> 51:49.003
but we'd find him.

51:50.970 --> 51:54.201
So how's the search going?

51:54.203 --> 51:56.068
Uh...

51:56.070 --> 51:59.568
it's been a few, um...

51:59.570 --> 52:03.501
it's been a few...

52:03.503 --> 52:06.467
Our son is with
my parents.

52:06.469 --> 52:08.270
So...

52:10.203 --> 52:12.870
I'm gonna go lay back down.

52:18.237 --> 52:20.271
Nice meeting you.

52:53.169 --> 52:55.070
There's something out here,
isn't there?

52:57.570 --> 52:59.370
Yeah.

53:01.468 --> 53:03.235
Yeah, there is.

53:03.237 --> 53:07.068
I saw some things last night
that...

53:07.070 --> 53:09.071
I... I can't...

53:14.036 --> 53:17.270
Hey, you're gonna hate this.
Um...

53:19.270 --> 53:21.304
But what if we stayed?

53:23.170 --> 53:25.202
- Like permanently?
- Yeah.

53:25.204 --> 53:27.534
You know, we'd be
taken care of.

53:27.536 --> 53:32.334
Nothing to worry about except
for doing our own thing.

53:32.336 --> 53:34.267
There's kind of an order
to things here, you know?

53:34.269 --> 53:35.601
It's fair.

53:35.603 --> 53:39.470
Like something really is
watching out for us.

53:42.536 --> 53:44.601
I don't know.

53:44.603 --> 53:48.067
I always thought that if I did
experience

53:48.069 --> 53:51.035
that there was something more
to all of this,

53:51.037 --> 53:55.304
that I'd like start going to
church or something.

53:57.002 --> 53:59.268
Everybody thinks that.

53:59.270 --> 54:01.837
But last night I was walking
back to the cabin...

54:04.469 --> 54:08.970
and there was this girl at one
of the cabins, and she was...

54:12.036 --> 54:13.834
What?

54:13.836 --> 54:17.067
She wasn't all "Kumbaya" like
the rest of the camp.

54:17.069 --> 54:19.567
She was really scared and sad
about something.

54:19.569 --> 54:21.301
I don't know, I just...

54:21.303 --> 54:24.401
I don't think comfort
is worth dying for.

54:24.403 --> 54:26.600
Look, man, there is no
mass suicide here.

54:26.602 --> 54:29.400
You're, like, leaping to
conclusions.

54:29.402 --> 54:32.301
We can't go back to our,
like, regular shitty lives

54:32.303 --> 54:36.138
knowing that there's actually
something out here.

54:38.204 --> 54:40.501
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

54:40.503 --> 54:45.266
Hal said the answer is at
the bottom of this lake.

54:45.268 --> 54:49.534
So I am going to bottom
of this lake.

54:49.536 --> 54:51.334
Answer to what?

54:51.336 --> 54:54.771
Exactly what "it" is.

54:56.536 --> 54:57.904
Well, that's way culty.

55:36.902 --> 55:38.167
Oh!

55:38.169 --> 55:40.167
- Not a god, it's a monster!
- What?

55:40.169 --> 55:42.367
There's something down there!
I saw it! It held me down!

55:42.369 --> 55:44.501
- What?
- I don't know!

55:44.503 --> 55:46.370
Go!

56:24.602 --> 56:26.201
We're leaving.

56:26.203 --> 56:28.266
- It's a tape.
- I don't care, we're leaving.

56:28.268 --> 56:29.901
Look, man, I know
you've been just...

56:29.903 --> 56:32.366
dying to make something up
and get me out of here.

56:32.368 --> 56:36.067
But I didn't see a monster
or anything.

56:36.069 --> 56:38.233
And actually, everything's
fine here.

56:38.235 --> 56:40.202
Fine, you can stay.
I'm leaving.

56:42.036 --> 56:45.233
Look, we both know that's just
not happening, all right?

56:45.235 --> 56:47.867
Look, we'll go back
to the camp.

56:47.869 --> 56:49.901
We'll say our good-byes like
we're normal people,

56:49.903 --> 56:51.501
and then we'll go,
all right?

56:51.503 --> 56:53.200
- All right.
- All right. Good.

56:53.202 --> 56:54.203
- Great.
- Good!

56:56.503 --> 56:58.867
I wish you guys
could stay longer.

56:58.869 --> 57:00.533
Yeah, me, too.

57:00.535 --> 57:03.867
Yeah, really hard to leave,
but we gotta get back to work.

57:03.869 --> 57:06.001
Hey, I drew you
a going-away gift.

57:06.003 --> 57:08.967
Oh. Wow.
Thank you.

57:08.969 --> 57:11.366
That's, uh...

57:11.368 --> 57:13.267
that's honest.

57:13.269 --> 57:15.968
Hey.

57:15.970 --> 57:18.034
Do you mind if we get
a little...

57:18.036 --> 57:20.234
culty in here?

57:20.236 --> 57:22.133
One last time?

57:22.135 --> 57:25.434
Um... no.

57:25.436 --> 57:27.036
- You sure?
- Yeah.

57:29.135 --> 57:31.366
Everybody...

57:31.368 --> 57:34.834
Justin and Aaron found a message
in the lake today.

57:34.836 --> 57:37.534
That's awesome. We haven't had
one of those in a while.

57:37.536 --> 57:39.935
Thought we'd have
a viewing ceremony.

57:39.937 --> 57:42.433
- To send 'em off.
- What is it?

57:42.435 --> 57:45.434
It's how to communicate
with us.

57:45.436 --> 57:47.336
With images.

57:49.236 --> 57:51.001
I'm, uh... I'm Michael.

57:51.003 --> 57:53.134
So you guys are, like,
in a church group?

57:53.136 --> 57:54.601
Uh, nice to meet you, Mike.

57:54.603 --> 57:57.099
We're prophets of
the Camp Arcadia faith.

57:57.101 --> 57:59.233
Our whole thing is just making
sure that people know

57:59.235 --> 58:01.501
that self-sacrifice for
the one true god

58:01.503 --> 58:04.234
is the only way to begin the
journey into the cosmos.

58:04.236 --> 58:05.934
Yeah, Justin's
taught me a whole lot

58:05.936 --> 58:07.533
about our coming apocalypse,
so, you know,

58:07.535 --> 58:09.834
if you ever wanna come worship
with us at the camp,

58:09.836 --> 58:11.433
we'd love to have you.

58:11.435 --> 58:13.301
And we also
take small donations.

58:13.303 --> 58:18.234
We're just devoted to...
to... to... to... to...

58:24.602 --> 58:27.434
So...

58:27.436 --> 58:31.433
it appears that the message
is forgiveness.

58:31.435 --> 58:35.236
Forgiveness for those lies.

58:40.336 --> 58:43.000
That was embarrassing.

58:43.002 --> 58:47.033
Guys, guys, guys.
Guys, wait up.

58:47.035 --> 58:49.401
I didn't know that's what it
would be.

58:49.403 --> 58:52.534
It's not supposed to be
embarrassing.

58:52.536 --> 58:54.334
It's a lesson.

58:54.336 --> 58:56.033
What does that mean?

58:56.035 --> 58:58.537
Forgiveness.

59:01.969 --> 59:06.500
We forgive you for going out
and evangelizing us

59:06.502 --> 59:10.400
as a UFO death cult
or whatever.

59:10.402 --> 59:13.100
Then telling the press,

59:13.102 --> 59:15.871
among other things, that all of
us are castrated.

59:17.203 --> 59:19.200
You are castrated.

59:19.202 --> 59:21.501
As far as I know,

59:21.503 --> 59:24.999
everybody here has
their sex organs.

59:25.001 --> 59:27.500
You told me the camp...
they had to do that.

59:27.502 --> 59:29.067
That they sanctioned
all of that.

59:29.069 --> 59:31.433
- I never said that.
- Yes, you did! Why...

59:31.435 --> 59:33.067
Why did we tell that story?

59:33.069 --> 59:34.533
Why did we go and tell
that story?

59:34.535 --> 59:36.133
I knew there was
something wrong here.

59:36.135 --> 59:38.334
And there is something
very wrong here.

59:38.336 --> 59:39.834
And I did what I had to do
to keep to safe.

59:39.836 --> 59:42.966
- And I'm sorry you're finding out this way...
- You made that all up?

59:42.968 --> 59:46.934
Without trying to throw fuel
on the fire here,

59:46.936 --> 59:51.034
would you say maybe it has something
to do with you wanting to lead?

59:51.036 --> 59:52.501
I'm trying to lead?

59:52.503 --> 59:55.934
Even as a little boy, you were
never comfortable

59:55.936 --> 59:58.537
with there being no leader here
giving definite answers.

01:00:00.502 --> 01:00:04.934
Maybe you take crappy pictures
because "it" takes pictures.

01:00:04.936 --> 01:00:06.534
Maybe you wanna be "it."

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.400
You wanna control, you wanna
be the alpha.

01:00:08.402 --> 01:00:09.935
You've led to me
so fucking much.

01:00:09.937 --> 01:00:12.035
He lied to you.
Fuck him!

01:00:16.336 --> 01:00:20.000
I pulled the both of you...

01:00:20.002 --> 01:00:23.533
out of your mother's
burning car.

01:00:23.535 --> 01:00:28.034
I gave you food,
I gave you shelter,

01:00:28.036 --> 01:00:31.203
I gave you every opportunity
to grow.

01:00:32.503 --> 01:00:35.904
And what you did
to undermine us...

01:00:38.136 --> 01:00:40.934
Let's just forget the fact

01:00:40.936 --> 01:00:42.400
that we are never
gonna get Dave

01:00:42.402 --> 01:00:45.999
to take that damned white
button-up shirt off...

01:00:46.001 --> 01:00:49.134
Can you imagine trying to sell
your beer

01:00:49.136 --> 01:00:52.434
when someone can find a news
article that makes you look like

01:00:52.436 --> 01:00:54.334
a dickless, poison Kool-Aid
drinking,

01:00:54.336 --> 01:00:56.201
Heaven's Gate offshoot?

01:00:56.203 --> 01:00:58.467
That is our livelihood.

01:00:58.469 --> 01:01:01.470
So, no!
Fuck you!

01:01:07.837 --> 01:01:11.999
She's up there, terrified,

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:15.034
with some story about
how you're going

01:01:15.036 --> 01:01:18.500
to help her find her missing
husband.

01:01:18.502 --> 01:01:21.033
What are you doing here, Hal?

01:01:21.035 --> 01:01:23.035
Walk away, man.

01:01:26.001 --> 01:01:28.267
- Come on.
- No.

01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:29.601
- Let's go.
- No.

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:31.537
- Now!
- No!

01:01:34.535 --> 01:01:37.033
You are a fucking
cult leader!

01:01:37.035 --> 01:01:40.134
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

01:01:40.136 --> 01:01:42.970
Or we can go inside and we can
put that to a vote.

01:01:44.503 --> 01:01:48.137
But why don't you just make it
easy on everybody.

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:21.999
God damn it, Aaron.

01:02:28.102 --> 01:02:29.470
Fuck!

01:03:49.168 --> 01:03:52.100
Hey, I'm sorry to come by so late.

01:03:52.102 --> 01:03:55.466
I'm, uh, lost and, uh...

01:03:57.336 --> 01:04:00.833
Hey, I can hear you
in there.

01:04:00.835 --> 01:04:02.233
It's Justin from
ten years ago.

01:04:02.235 --> 01:04:04.835
Can you just help me out?

01:04:17.403 --> 01:04:20.034
Why are you in my house?!

01:04:20.036 --> 01:04:22.466
Why the fuck are you
in my house?!

01:04:22.468 --> 01:04:24.401
Uh...

01:04:24.403 --> 01:04:26.504
God damn it!
Fuck me all to hell!

01:04:28.002 --> 01:04:30.366
Just-just sit down
or whatever, all right?

01:04:30.368 --> 01:04:34.503
Careful around my bike!
Don't you fucking touch my bike!

01:04:40.902 --> 01:04:43.099
So, a decade ago,

01:04:43.101 --> 01:04:45.601
I tell you that you're livin'
in some sort of death cult,

01:04:45.603 --> 01:04:48.100
and not only were you not bright
enough then to figure it out,

01:04:48.102 --> 01:04:50.867
you actually came back.

01:04:50.869 --> 01:04:52.366
You are not smart.

01:04:52.368 --> 01:04:55.301
You never have been, no.

01:04:55.303 --> 01:04:57.234
I mean, all kids are dumb,

01:04:57.236 --> 01:05:00.300
but you're like some sort of
retarded hobbit or something.

01:05:00.302 --> 01:05:03.233
I'm sorry.
I, uh...

01:05:03.235 --> 01:05:05.066
I don't know how
I got lost.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:07.034
I don't know how you're hanging
in there

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:08.500
and standing in front of me.

01:05:08.502 --> 01:05:10.234
I don't understand what's going
on at that camp.

01:05:10.236 --> 01:05:13.066
Bunch of loopin' prisons, man.

01:05:13.068 --> 01:05:15.503
Like shitty pods of time.

01:05:17.268 --> 01:05:19.100
Repeatin' over and over
and over again

01:05:19.102 --> 01:05:22.537
like rats tellin' stories
for that thing's amusement!

01:05:26.203 --> 01:05:28.034
My loop's short as hell, bro.

01:05:28.036 --> 01:05:29.967
Hell, some are even shorter.

01:05:29.969 --> 01:05:32.467
Hell, you fools, you fools up at
that hippy-dippy camp bullshit,

01:05:32.469 --> 01:05:35.303
you're something like, what,
ten years now?

01:05:37.569 --> 01:05:41.099
You gotta kill yourself
before the restart

01:05:41.101 --> 01:05:43.434
or that thing,
that thing'll do it for ya.

01:05:43.436 --> 01:05:46.770
And it's much worse than
anything you can do to yourself.

01:05:49.436 --> 01:05:54.166
But the camp prefers that thing
doin' it for 'em, doesn't it?

01:05:54.168 --> 01:05:56.302
Yeah, considers it
sacred even.

01:06:03.901 --> 01:06:06.869
It'll snatch you
right out of your shoes.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:16.902
I feel terrible.

01:06:19.968 --> 01:06:23.099
I know better than that.

01:06:23.101 --> 01:06:26.234
Well, it just sounds like you
lost your temper, that's all.

01:06:26.236 --> 01:06:28.036
It happens.

01:06:30.235 --> 01:06:31.835
Hal.

01:06:40.002 --> 01:06:41.501
Anyone want a beer?

01:06:41.503 --> 01:06:44.266
Yeah, thanks.

01:06:44.268 --> 01:06:45.269
Okay.

01:06:49.568 --> 01:06:52.835
Hey, we all know that
your brother's a good guy.

01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:57.834
We all knew about
the cult thing, but...

01:06:57.836 --> 01:07:00.033
Whatever.
It's in the past.

01:07:00.035 --> 01:07:02.201
You don't think most of us

01:07:02.203 --> 01:07:06.166
have something we wish we could
just leave behind?

01:07:08.503 --> 01:07:11.301
The rest of it, though,
it just...

01:07:11.303 --> 01:07:14.202
You know, this place protects us
from some of it.

01:07:16.902 --> 01:07:20.366
But history repeats itself,
regardless.

01:07:20.368 --> 01:07:24.366
The old skipping record plays
on, doesn't it?

01:07:24.368 --> 01:07:27.336
I'm just grateful I get
to live at all.

01:07:35.901 --> 01:07:39.337
Don't do it
if you don't want to.

01:07:47.135 --> 01:07:49.900
Everything all right?

01:07:49.902 --> 01:07:52.166
Yeah.

01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:55.134
You might not be able to tell
because of that big ol' beard,

01:07:55.136 --> 01:07:58.102
but Tim, he just
worries a lot.

01:07:59.335 --> 01:08:02.336
Anything I need
to worry about?

01:08:09.268 --> 01:08:12.434
Yeah, you get used to it.

01:08:12.436 --> 01:08:16.599
Suicide option. Mm.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.499
I ain't no mathematician,

01:08:18.501 --> 01:08:23.100
but every few hours since '09...
now what is that? Hmm?

01:08:23.102 --> 01:08:25.303
Well, it's a fucking lot!

01:08:27.368 --> 01:08:30.067
But what you wanna do is,
you wanna get...

01:08:30.069 --> 01:08:33.599
you wanna get unlost...
and then leave again,

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:36.100
like you're not some Mongoloid
motherfucker, am I right?

01:08:36.102 --> 01:08:39.267
'Cause if you let it
have you,

01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:42.567
and you're still in the borders
when the loop resets,

01:08:42.569 --> 01:08:45.366
you'll be stuck as shit
forever.

01:08:45.368 --> 01:08:47.500
Hmm?

01:08:47.502 --> 01:08:50.466
Now, you should be able to follow
that trail there, shouldn't you?

01:08:50.468 --> 01:08:53.600
Everything looked different
all of a sudden, and I...

01:08:53.602 --> 01:08:57.099
Yeah, I remember that.
Oh, yeah.

01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:59.167
Thing is, you're old
as fuck now.

01:08:59.169 --> 01:09:01.899
And more likely just to...
just to toe the line.

01:09:01.902 --> 01:09:03.500
You know,
so shit shifts around a bit,

01:09:03.502 --> 01:09:06.499
put some confusion in that
little IQ of yours to get ya.

01:09:06.501 --> 01:09:09.966
I just really got to get back to Camp
Arcadia and get back to my brother.

01:09:09.968 --> 01:09:11.499
I can do that for you.

01:09:11.501 --> 01:09:13.567
Great. How do I get back?

01:09:13.569 --> 01:09:15.366
Oh, not for free.

01:09:15.368 --> 01:09:16.999
Big 'ol fuck no.

01:09:18.868 --> 01:09:20.466
No, you gotta
suck my dick first.

01:09:20.468 --> 01:09:22.433
What?

01:09:22.435 --> 01:09:26.069
You have to suck
my dick first.

01:09:31.136 --> 01:09:33.533
I'm just fuckin' with ya!

01:09:33.535 --> 01:09:36.567
Your fuckin' face!
Uh...

01:09:39.068 --> 01:09:41.201
No, but seriously,
not for free, no.

01:09:41.203 --> 01:09:43.066
All right, look, I don't know
what I can give you,

01:09:43.068 --> 01:09:45.399
but I really just gotta get back
and get back to my brother

01:09:45.402 --> 01:09:48.036
and drive us outta here
before whatever's about...

01:10:14.936 --> 01:10:18.400
We're all stuck in these
fuckin' things, man!

01:10:18.402 --> 01:10:21.134
But you're free,
you're free for now.

01:10:21.136 --> 01:10:23.833
It'll get you lost, but you
can walk right through 'em

01:10:23.835 --> 01:10:26.967
like some brainless dickhole.

01:10:26.969 --> 01:10:30.035
And since you wouldn't know a
carburetor from your cock...

01:10:32.835 --> 01:10:34.599
I want you to get me a gun.

01:10:34.601 --> 01:10:37.133
We have those back at camp.
I could just...

01:10:37.135 --> 01:10:39.465
I ain't falling for that, no.

01:10:39.467 --> 01:10:42.266
Sit down.

01:10:42.268 --> 01:10:45.302
All right, now this is our
circle, right here, okay?

01:10:46.901 --> 01:10:50.365
And there is this bitch-ass
tweaker, with a grip of guns,

01:10:50.367 --> 01:10:52.000
who sold me a broken computer

01:10:52.002 --> 01:10:54.034
before I was stuck up in this
fuckin' bitch,

01:10:54.036 --> 01:10:55.366
and he swore to God he'd make it
up to me.

01:10:55.368 --> 01:10:59.867
This is his filthy
fuckin' loop,

01:10:59.869 --> 01:11:02.999
and this is his shitty fuckin'
cabin right here, all right?

01:11:03.001 --> 01:11:06.134
The gun-nut tweaker?

01:11:06.136 --> 01:11:07.600
Yeah, the gun-nut tweaker.

01:11:07.602 --> 01:11:10.433
You just follow this map

01:11:10.435 --> 01:11:14.233
and these loop marker hoodoo
fuckamajigs.

01:11:14.235 --> 01:11:16.999
All right, and you'll find this
smelly junkie named Chris

01:11:17.001 --> 01:11:19.366
who's got a gun collection that'd
give Yosemite Sam a boner.

01:11:19.368 --> 01:11:22.567
Now, you bring me back a real
nice one. Okay?

01:11:22.569 --> 01:11:24.599
And I'll draw you one of these
fancy maps,

01:11:24.601 --> 01:11:26.366
get you back to your brother.

01:11:26.368 --> 01:11:30.066
Oh, and, uh...
use this compass.

01:11:30.068 --> 01:11:34.969
And trust only this compass,
not what you see.

01:11:37.902 --> 01:11:39.103
All right.

01:11:55.969 --> 01:12:00.000
It doesn't let me sleep.

01:12:00.002 --> 01:12:01.999
Funny thing is,
I don't get tired.

01:12:02.001 --> 01:12:04.368
I just...

01:12:07.901 --> 01:12:10.401
It doesn't let me dream.

01:12:13.969 --> 01:12:17.336
It does that so my mind
never leaves this place.

01:12:19.936 --> 01:12:22.035
These three hours...

01:12:28.501 --> 01:12:31.536
Using space and time
as its horsewhip.

01:12:40.434 --> 01:12:43.233
I'm, uh...

01:12:43.235 --> 01:12:45.533
I'm really sorry
to hear that.

01:12:45.535 --> 01:12:47.433
And I'll, uh...

01:12:47.435 --> 01:12:49.870
I'll see you soon.

I have this theory that it's

01:14:17.901 --> 01:14:20.300
See, retinas only have three
types of cone cells,

01:14:20.302 --> 01:14:22.299
so maybe none has
the signal strength

01:14:22.301 --> 01:14:25.433
to see it in our normal state.

01:14:25.435 --> 01:14:27.232
Just a theory, though.

01:14:27.234 --> 01:14:29.132
What we do know is that...

01:14:29.134 --> 01:14:32.236
it shows us what it sees.

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:36.935
It has a powerful
elegance to it.

01:14:39.368 --> 01:14:43.302
So, it was looking at me.

01:14:49.435 --> 01:14:52.966
Why did it send me
a picture of a trailer?

01:14:52.968 --> 01:14:55.533
Probably where to go.

01:14:55.535 --> 01:14:58.365
I was actually gonna go
find Justin.

01:14:58.367 --> 01:15:00.235
Well, there you go.

01:15:02.435 --> 01:15:04.833
I know that fight was really
hard for all of us last night,

01:15:04.835 --> 01:15:07.368
but can you help?

01:15:09.235 --> 01:15:13.166
I don't know anything anybody
else doesn't know about life.

01:15:13.168 --> 01:15:16.400
But last night's got me
thinking.

01:15:16.402 --> 01:15:20.000
Can you have power over
yourself,

01:15:20.002 --> 01:15:24.465
if you give up any amount of
authority to something else?

01:15:24.467 --> 01:15:26.098
I mean...

01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:28.599
I really do have to find
Justin...

01:15:28.601 --> 01:15:30.900
I mean, it's a good question.

01:15:30.902 --> 01:15:33.369
Always has been,
always will be.

01:15:35.367 --> 01:15:38.066
Go out to the route,
past Cabin Two.

01:15:38.068 --> 01:15:41.199
When you go past it,
you'll see a small trail.

01:15:41.201 --> 01:15:43.465
Just follow it for
a really long time.

01:15:43.467 --> 01:15:47.066
There's no way I'm not gonna
get lost if I do that.

01:15:47.068 --> 01:15:48.933
Can you please just
come with me?

01:15:48.935 --> 01:15:52.098
I literally can't go with you
to help you find your brother.

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.934
But you should.

01:15:53.936 --> 01:15:56.998
And I sincerely hope
he's okay.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.366
I really hope you make
your own choice.

01:16:00.368 --> 01:16:03.302
Before the third moon is full.

01:16:05.202 --> 01:16:06.502
Hal?

01:16:08.334 --> 01:16:09.970
Hal.

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:14.802
Tell me what that means.

01:16:20.067 --> 01:16:21.599
Saying more would be like

01:16:21.601 --> 01:16:24.936
trying to explain
an impossible color.

01:19:01.101 --> 01:19:02.832
Um...

01:19:02.834 --> 01:19:04.400
Carl sent me.

01:19:04.402 --> 01:19:06.166
Who?

01:19:06.168 --> 01:19:08.200
Carl. He, uh...

01:19:08.202 --> 01:19:10.770
Can you just open
the fucking door?!

01:19:20.868 --> 01:19:25.102
Uh, Carl sent me
and, uh...

01:19:26.901 --> 01:19:28.199
- What?
- Are you all right?

01:19:28.201 --> 01:19:31.066
Oh, this?
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

01:19:31.068 --> 01:19:33.166
It's not what it looks like.
Mike's trying to help me out.

01:19:33.168 --> 01:19:34.500
He's my buddy.

01:19:34.502 --> 01:19:37.933
Trying to, uh, you know,
get me clean and sober!

01:19:37.935 --> 01:19:40.400
Okay.
Um... so...

01:19:40.402 --> 01:19:41.933
Don't be weird, dude.
Come on in.

01:19:41.935 --> 01:19:43.503
Please.

01:19:46.435 --> 01:19:48.232
- What's your name?
- Justin.

01:19:48.234 --> 01:19:49.499
Let me stop you
right there, okay?

01:19:49.501 --> 01:19:51.265
Can I ask you a question?
Cool.

01:19:51.267 --> 01:19:53.865
Do you have any drugs or crack
at all on you?

01:19:53.867 --> 01:19:56.032
- What?
- Like drugs, in your pocket, right now, on you.

01:19:56.034 --> 01:19:58.199
Do you wanna share them with me?
I'd love to share them with you.

01:19:58.201 --> 01:20:01.301
But we have to do it fast, because
Mike's... Aah, there he is.

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:08.065
Mike, right?

01:20:08.067 --> 01:20:09.599
Yeah.

01:20:09.601 --> 01:20:11.932
Do you remember me from...

01:20:11.934 --> 01:20:13.933
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:13.935 --> 01:20:16.998
No, no, we're not interested
in your religion.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.133
And just so you know,
Chris is my best friend,

01:20:19.135 --> 01:20:21.533
he's a drug addict, I'm just
trying to get him clean.

01:20:21.535 --> 01:20:23.133
There's nothing weird
going on.

01:20:23.135 --> 01:20:25.132
Hey, I found this
hard drive.

01:20:25.134 --> 01:20:26.466
I think it might have
the answer.

01:20:26.468 --> 01:20:28.133
You hear that?
Mike found another message

01:20:28.135 --> 01:20:30.099
on a shitty hard drive.

01:20:30.101 --> 01:20:31.532
And it's great
to have company.

01:20:31.534 --> 01:20:35.832
Hey, Mike, why don't you get
our guest a chair?

01:20:35.834 --> 01:20:38.499
Okay, so what can we do
for you, sir?

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:43.533
Basically, Carl said that you
could give him a gun.

01:20:43.535 --> 01:20:45.166
Oh.

01:20:45.168 --> 01:20:47.066
You told Shitty Carl you'd
give him a gun?

01:20:47.068 --> 01:20:49.532
Yeah. I told you about that
a year ago.

01:20:49.534 --> 01:20:51.133
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

01:20:51.135 --> 01:20:52.432
Me and Shitty Carl
are shooting buddies.

01:20:52.434 --> 01:20:55.032
The two of you smoked crack
together

01:20:55.034 --> 01:20:56.733
and then would steal
the red buckets

01:20:56.735 --> 01:21:00.365
- from the Salvation Army guys outside of grocery stores.
- Why is that even relevant?

01:21:00.367 --> 01:21:03.133
You have horrible judgment
in other people.

01:21:03.135 --> 01:21:06.199
Shh.
Shh. Shh, shh.

01:21:19.901 --> 01:21:22.465
Can we try it another way?

01:21:22.467 --> 01:21:24.600
Please! Please!

01:21:36.602 --> 01:21:40.034
I guess that didn't work.

01:21:41.301 --> 01:21:42.533
What was that?

01:21:42.535 --> 01:21:45.865
It was either our past
or our future.

01:21:45.867 --> 01:21:47.965
Doesn't really make
any difference.

01:21:47.967 --> 01:21:49.833
Practically the same thing.

01:21:49.835 --> 01:21:52.265
See, we've been stuck in this
infinite loop,

01:21:52.267 --> 01:21:54.466
and we've been trying to do
different things to get out of it,

01:21:54.468 --> 01:21:56.965
and I guess that didn't
work.

01:21:56.967 --> 01:22:00.300
Oh, my God, if I have
to listen to you say

01:22:00.302 --> 01:22:04.399
one more time at the beginning,
"Holy shit, man! Fucking Mike!

01:22:04.401 --> 01:22:05.832
How the fuck are you, man?"

01:22:05.834 --> 01:22:07.266
I think I might blow
my brains out.

01:22:07.268 --> 01:22:09.199
What? What is that?
What accent is that?

01:22:09.201 --> 01:22:10.866
Is that Irish?

01:22:10.868 --> 01:22:13.233
That's how you sound.
It's what you sound like.

01:22:13.235 --> 01:22:15.232
What about you?
At the beginning of the thing?

01:22:15.234 --> 01:22:18.132
You come to the woods with your
hair combed full of gel,

01:22:18.134 --> 01:22:24.133
all hunched over like some kind
of James Bond with scoliosis

01:22:24.135 --> 01:22:26.935
trying to hide a boner.

01:22:28.467 --> 01:22:31.801
Hey, can I impart some wisdom
upon you?

01:22:35.201 --> 01:22:39.566
Don't ever give in.
Not once.

01:22:39.568 --> 01:22:41.866
The trick to this whole thing

01:22:41.868 --> 01:22:45.199
is to not be afraid of
something that's...

01:22:45.201 --> 01:22:46.965
that's horrifying.

01:22:46.967 --> 01:22:49.199
And everyone's afraid of it.

01:22:49.201 --> 01:22:52.466
But if you let it control you
one time,

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:55.332
it's gonna fucking control you
over and over again.

01:22:55.334 --> 01:22:57.166
I mean, look at me and Mike.

01:22:57.168 --> 01:23:00.066
We're just a couple of assholes
taking someone else's shit.

01:23:00.068 --> 01:23:03.332
You gotta floor it
the fuck out of here.

01:23:03.334 --> 01:23:07.265
And if you see that thing,
you don't apologize to it,

01:23:07.267 --> 01:23:11.933
you don't bow down to it,
you don't conform,

01:23:11.935 --> 01:23:14.599
you just fucking run.

01:23:14.601 --> 01:23:16.866
Like your life fucking depends
on it, man,

01:23:16.868 --> 01:23:20.866
because your fucking life
depends on it.

01:23:20.868 --> 01:23:24.400
All right? That's my advice
to you.

01:23:24.402 --> 01:23:26.902
I wish you safe passage.

01:23:28.468 --> 01:23:30.002

01:23:33.201 --> 01:23:36.200

You wanna try it?

01:23:36.202 --> 01:23:38.599
Yeah. Let's do it.

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:42.266
Well, that's hard to tell.
I mean, when we first got here,

01:25:42.268 --> 01:25:45.566
I said if I got Chris clean
in a week, we'd leave,

01:25:45.568 --> 01:25:48.898
and that was, um...

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:50.464
that was a lot of weeks ago.

01:25:50.466 --> 01:25:53.300
Yeah, I keep thinking there's
like this configuration

01:25:53.302 --> 01:25:55.200
that's gonna break us out
of the story, you know,

01:25:55.202 --> 01:25:57.099
like a "Life Rubik's Cube."

01:25:57.101 --> 01:25:59.066
The one thing I do know for
certain

01:25:59.068 --> 01:26:01.898
is I would rather
reset things on my terms

01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:04.434
than allow that fucker
to do it for me.

01:26:06.967 --> 01:26:10.099
Well, what's the first thing you're
gonna do when you get out of here?

01:26:10.101 --> 01:26:12.168
See my wife Jenn
and our baby.

01:26:13.968 --> 01:26:15.832
You know, it's funny,
she used to leave these

01:26:15.834 --> 01:26:18.266
annoying little notes around
the house.

01:26:18.268 --> 01:26:21.932
You know, used to really get
under my skin.

01:26:21.934 --> 01:26:26.001
Man, what I wouldn't give to
wake up to one of those notes.

01:26:28.868 --> 01:26:33.065
I just hope she's happy
and moved on.

01:26:33.067 --> 01:26:35.865
You know, it's funny,
we never, uh...

01:26:35.867 --> 01:26:38.464
we never anticipate the ways
we're gonna isolate ourselves

01:26:38.466 --> 01:26:41.199
from the ones we care about.

01:26:41.201 --> 01:26:45.266
Anyway, I hope you find your
brother, you know.

01:26:45.268 --> 01:26:48.468
Good luck, and don't get stuck.

01:26:56.367 --> 01:26:58.269
Hey, Mike?

01:27:00.267 --> 01:27:01.902
I'm...

01:27:04.367 --> 01:27:07.468
I really hope
you get out here.

01:27:49.001 --> 01:27:51.535
Because fuck you.

01:28:49.267 --> 01:28:50.899
Chris, it's Mike!

01:28:50.901 --> 01:28:52.932
Your best friend!

01:28:52.934 --> 01:28:55.432
Don't shoot!

01:28:55.434 --> 01:28:58.498
Holy shit, man!
Fucking Mike!

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.099
How the fuck are you, man?!

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:03.364
Uh, I'm good, man,
I'm good. How are you?

01:29:03.366 --> 01:29:05.933
Fucking fantastic, man!
I'm livin' the dream!

01:29:05.935 --> 01:29:07.332
Isn't this place the tits?

01:29:07.334 --> 01:29:11.136
Yeah.
It's something else.

01:30:16.234 --> 01:30:18.835
Justin!

01:30:20.234 --> 01:30:21.933
I've been looking for you
all day.

01:30:21.935 --> 01:30:23.198
Jesus. You scared the shit
out of me.

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.398
Why'd you do that?

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.199
Why did you just
take off like that?

01:30:26.201 --> 01:30:28.599
I didn't just take off,
I was asked to leave.

01:30:28.601 --> 01:30:30.869
I thought you'd got
eaten by a bear.

01:30:32.467 --> 01:30:34.398
Now I'm lost.
Are you lost?

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:36.966
Yeah, I'm lost. Because you
left the dome light on again

01:30:36.968 --> 01:30:38.532
and didn't get a new car
battery.

01:30:38.534 --> 01:30:40.565
- Doesn't make any sense.
- You don't make any sense.

01:30:40.567 --> 01:30:42.431
- Are you gonna apologize?
- Hurry up.

01:30:42.433 --> 01:30:44.432
We're gonna have to push start
the car to get out in time

01:30:44.434 --> 01:30:46.468
and you're not very strong.

01:30:48.068 --> 01:30:49.332
Hello?

01:30:49.334 --> 01:30:53.167
We're, uh...
lost.

01:31:02.001 --> 01:31:04.565
Ah, the flower.

01:31:04.567 --> 01:31:07.132
It's actually a flower.

01:31:07.134 --> 01:31:09.033
That's unexpected, right?

01:31:09.035 --> 01:31:10.432
No. Can we go?

01:31:10.434 --> 01:31:13.065
Yeah, there's no one here.

01:31:13.067 --> 01:31:14.965
I think I can figure it out
with a compass.

01:31:14.967 --> 01:31:17.001
It'll just take forever.

01:31:24.568 --> 01:31:27.335
It'll just take forever.

01:31:34.401 --> 01:31:36.869
It'll just take forever.

01:32:09.367 --> 01:32:11.098
So, Anna...

01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:15.332
Yeah.
Yeah, we slept together.

01:32:15.334 --> 01:32:17.933
- Wow.
- Yeah.

01:32:17.935 --> 01:32:20.498
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:22.566
I've never done that.

01:32:22.568 --> 01:32:24.498
Yeah, we went to bed around
midnight,

01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:26.566
and had a really good night's
sleep

01:32:26.568 --> 01:32:29.498
and then when I woke up, I saw
you were still gone

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:32.934
so I came to rescue you.
You're welcome.

01:32:34.434 --> 01:32:36.565
You mean you literally just
slept together?

01:32:36.567 --> 01:32:39.531
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- I know that's what you said,

01:32:39.533 --> 01:32:41.532
but usually when people say they
slept together,

01:32:41.534 --> 01:32:43.432
it means that they had sex.

01:32:43.434 --> 01:32:45.833
Pretty sure the word "sleep"
means when you close your eyes,

01:32:45.835 --> 01:32:47.364
get comfortable, become
unconscious...

01:32:47.366 --> 01:32:48.933
Never mind. Never mind.

01:32:48.935 --> 01:32:51.435
God, I feel like I'm gonna die
of thirst.

01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:55.168
You all right?

01:33:04.166 --> 01:33:06.964
Not much left.
You don't need it?

01:33:06.966 --> 01:33:10.368
No, Aaron,
I don't need water.

01:34:42.999 --> 01:34:45.132
All right.
Now, if we hurry,

01:34:45.134 --> 01:34:49.335
we might make it back to camp
before the third moon.

01:34:54.166 --> 01:34:56.267
Come on, let's go.

01:34:59.067 --> 01:35:01.064
I gotta talk to you
about something.

01:35:01.066 --> 01:35:03.065
Great. Tell me on the way
back to the car.

01:35:03.067 --> 01:35:05.165
No, man.

01:35:05.167 --> 01:35:07.801
Can you just have a seat
for a second?

01:35:19.167 --> 01:35:20.502
I'm staying.

01:35:25.134 --> 01:35:27.198
You can stay, too.

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.199
I know you're not going to,
but, you know...

01:35:29.201 --> 01:35:30.931
you can.

01:35:30.933 --> 01:35:35.231
You wanna die over
and over and over

01:35:35.233 --> 01:35:38.098
and live your life on repeat
from here to eternity?

01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:39.898
You act like it's crazy,

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:41.431
like I'm the first person
in history

01:35:41.433 --> 01:35:43.965
that actually wants to
live forever.

01:35:43.967 --> 01:35:47.964
With people that like him.

01:35:47.966 --> 01:35:50.331
You know, there's not much
difference between

01:35:50.333 --> 01:35:54.431
being stuck in a loop and being
stuck repeating

01:35:54.433 --> 01:35:59.897
the same shitty day over and
over like back home until I die.

01:35:59.899 --> 01:36:02.532
But back home,
anything could happen.

01:36:02.534 --> 01:36:04.598
It could be so much better
than the camp.

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:07.965
We tried that, man.

01:36:07.967 --> 01:36:09.398
For almost a decade.

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:12.900
And I'm ready to go back to not
hating my life.

01:36:15.067 --> 01:36:18.301
Dying just takes a second.

01:36:20.099 --> 01:36:22.531
And a shitty life is long.

01:36:22.533 --> 01:36:28.531
Aaron, I think you are making
a very, very big decision

01:36:28.533 --> 01:36:31.165
with very little thought.

01:36:31.167 --> 01:36:35.368
And you realize that you do this
once and you can never leave?

01:36:41.033 --> 01:36:46.767
Anything is better than
the life you make me live.

01:36:51.433 --> 01:36:55.265
All right.
Um...

01:36:55.267 --> 01:36:57.831
Let's, uh...

01:36:57.833 --> 01:37:00.034
let's get you back.

01:37:34.333 --> 01:37:36.801
Aah!

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.033
God damn it!

01:40:08.133 --> 01:40:09.967
Seriously, what do you
think it hit?

01:40:36.367 --> 01:40:39.864
No. Wait! Wait!

01:40:39.866 --> 01:40:42.033
Shit!

01:41:21.133 --> 01:41:23.933
They're coming back.

01:41:55.466 --> 01:41:59.065
I'll feel guilty the rest of my
life if I leave you here,

01:41:59.067 --> 01:42:03.534
so I guess I'm staying, too.

01:42:07.834 --> 01:42:12.335
You're respecting my decision
to stay?

01:42:14.499 --> 01:42:19.264
Uh, I guess.

01:42:19.266 --> 01:42:22.364
If that's the way you wanna
think about it, yeah, sure,

01:42:22.366 --> 01:42:24.234
I'm doing that.

01:42:33.201 --> 01:42:35.398
All right. Let's go.

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:36.564
What?

01:42:36.566 --> 01:42:38.565
All I ever wanted was...

01:42:48.067 --> 01:42:50.165
Let's go!

01:42:50.167 --> 01:42:52.365
- Please start! Please start!
- Let's go!

01:42:57.067 --> 01:42:58.464
All right, when you get
enough speed,

01:42:58.466 --> 01:43:01.364
I'm gonna jump in.
Then you jump in.

01:43:01.366 --> 01:43:04.232
And then I'm gonna throw it in
first and let the clutch go.

01:43:04.234 --> 01:43:05.498
I know how to
push-start a car!

01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:07.430
I'm just saying
what we're doing!

01:43:07.432 --> 01:43:08.831
- Let me drive.
- What?

01:43:08.833 --> 01:43:10.463
Let me drive the car!

01:43:10.465 --> 01:43:12.299
Just let me get it started
first!

01:43:12.301 --> 01:43:14.097
Uhh! Fuck!

01:43:14.099 --> 01:43:15.832
Okay, you drive the fucking car!

01:43:15.834 --> 01:43:17.968
Yeah, I'm gonna drive
the fucking car!

01:43:21.066 --> 01:43:23.431
Hey, listen, man...

01:43:23.433 --> 01:43:28.201
'Cause we're about to die, I
really think you should know...

01:43:29.934 --> 01:43:33.231
you mess up everything.

01:43:33.233 --> 01:43:34.564
You really do.

01:43:34.566 --> 01:43:36.463
I never say it,

01:43:36.465 --> 01:43:38.265
but you have just completely
messed up our lives.

01:43:39.867 --> 01:43:41.132
Aah!

01:43:42.533 --> 01:43:45.065
But you're family.

01:43:45.067 --> 01:43:47.265
That's what family does.

01:43:47.267 --> 01:43:50.965
All I've ever wanted is just to
be able to mess up with you.

01:43:50.967 --> 01:43:54.466
To be able to mess up our
lives just as much as you do.

01:43:58.234 --> 01:44:01.564
All right, listen, on
tombstones it says like

01:44:01.566 --> 01:44:04.864
"Beloved Mother"
or "Beloved Brother",

01:44:04.866 --> 01:44:06.364
not "Beloved Camp Member".

01:44:06.366 --> 01:44:09.965
And there's a reason for that,
all right?

01:44:09.967 --> 01:44:12.265
From here on out,
we're equals.

01:44:12.267 --> 01:44:14.032
I hear you.

01:44:14.034 --> 01:44:15.932
You're my brother.
And I love you.

01:44:15.934 --> 01:44:17.564
- I love you, too.
- And I need you to start this car

01:44:17.566 --> 01:44:20.098
because I don't want you to die
or me to die, okay?

01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:21.164
- Get in!
- All right!

01:45:44.332 --> 01:45:45.397
- We made it!
- We made it!

01:45:45.399 --> 01:45:47.898
- We did it!
- Yes!

01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:50.132
Yeah!

01:46:27.165 --> 01:46:30.097
We need gas.

01:46:30.099 --> 01:46:32.163
No, we're good.

01:46:32.165 --> 01:46:34.597
No, it's on empty.

01:46:34.599 --> 01:46:37.197
- It's always like that.
- Always on empty?

01:46:37.199 --> 01:46:38.897
Empty means there's no fuel
in the tank.

01:46:38.899 --> 01:46:40.767
We couldn't even...

01:46:48.899 --> 01:46:51.300
You figure it out.
