WEBVTT

00:01.560 --> 00:06.190
I never get used to its magnitude, what
it's taken to keep this country free.

00:06.280 --> 00:11.832
All societies build monuments to their dead
to convince combatants it's an honour to die.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.717
For these servicemen, it was.

00:13.800 --> 00:18.635
And for somebody to use this place
to protest the warjust pisses me off.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.678
These lives gave them that
right. They should be respected.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.558
If they were respected,
fewer'd be buried here.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.029
- We gonna get into something?
- I don't see why.

00:27.120 --> 00:30.556
We both wish this place
were a lot smaller.

00:30.640 --> 00:34.269
Agent Booth, Dr Brennan, right this way.

00:34.920 --> 00:41.712
Must've happened in the middle of the night.
The place is so big no one saw the fire.

00:43.720 --> 00:47.918
- The accelerant was charcoaI starter.
- We didn't find a suicide note.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.994
- A protester would leave a note.
- Didn't need to. It's on Charlie Kent's grave.

00:53.080 --> 00:57.437
Press was coming today to do a tribute
to him. One-year anniversary of his death.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.988
- Charlie Kent?
- In the NationaI Guard.

01:00.080 --> 01:03.152
About to be drafted by the NBA
when he got shipped out to Iraq.

01:03.240 --> 01:08.951
He gave his life killing a group of insurgents
to save his unit. Won the Silver Star.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.952
It's male, African descent,

01:12.040 --> 01:17.512
approximately 20 to 29 years old.
Too early to determine cause of death.

01:17.600 --> 01:22.435
- I'm not a pro, but I'm guessing fire.
- The White House and DOD want an ID ASAP.

01:22.520 --> 01:25.637
- So they can brand him a traitor.
- Why so cynicaI?

01:25.720 --> 01:28.757
I'm not. It's a necessary part
of the psychology of warfare.

01:28.840 --> 01:33.197
Heroes and villains. Without clear
distinctions, we'd never be able to fight.

01:33.280 --> 01:37.353
Well, I always found being
shot at is a motivating factor.

01:37.440 --> 01:43.993
Bag these fragments of his clothing. I also
want any singed plant life or debris you find.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.071
<i>I'm on it.</i>

01:51.720 --> 01:53.995
What?

01:54.080 --> 01:55.877
It's Jamie Richards.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.520
We were in the Rangers together.

01:58.600 --> 02:03.390
He was hit by a roadside bomb
just... outside the green zone.

02:04.680 --> 02:08.592
He left a... wife and two kids.

02:11.400 --> 02:17.475
- The fact that he was near this...
- You believe somehow he's here watching?

02:17.560 --> 02:20.154
Yeah. You don't. I get that.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.435
I know you think he's
a good man. That's...

02:25.520 --> 02:27.511
That's enough for me.

02:28.960 --> 02:33.238
Zack, I want pictures of all
remaining tissue before he's moved.

02:33.320 --> 02:37.996
<i>The unidentified suicide victim was
found at Private Kent's grave today.</i>

02:38.080 --> 02:42.949
<i>Services had been planned to honour Kent on
the one-year anniversary of his death in Iraq.</i>

02:43.040 --> 02:46.396
Ah, I used to love watching
Kent play. He could fly.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.597
He made 46.4% of his three-point
attempts in his last season.

02:49.680 --> 02:53.992
- A basketball fan? I'm surprised.
- Zack, I'd like you to keep cleaning the bones.

02:54.080 --> 02:57.914
<i>Did you see the game against North
Carolina? 53 points and 18 rebounds.</i>

02:58.000 --> 03:00.116
Zack!

03:00.200 --> 03:03.875
- Sorry. Cleaning.
- It's difficult knowing he'll never play again.

03:03.960 --> 03:08.238
- It makes the war so reaI.
- Which is odd, since fiction got us there.

03:08.320 --> 03:14.475
- Shouldn't we stand up to tyrants?
- I've waited for the press to do it for 3 years.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.597
- I can't believe you took the bait.
- Yeah. Me neither.

03:19.520 --> 03:24.230
Oh! Press Office of Defence. Please ID
him. This is the third call in an hour.

03:24.320 --> 03:30.190
Hello? Yes. It's a pleasure to hear from
you again, sir. Yes. We're very close.

03:30.280 --> 03:35.991
I fed his dentals, approximate age, height
and sketch I made from the tissue markers

03:36.080 --> 03:38.071
into the DOD database.

03:38.160 --> 03:42.790
The victim had lamb about an hour before
his death. Of course it's overcooked now.

03:42.880 --> 03:46.509
- Toasted himself. Who cares what he ate?
- Just doing ourjobs, Booth.

03:46.600 --> 03:50.195
- Been told to sweep this under the
rug? - Can the left-wing conspiracy.

03:50.280 --> 03:53.352
- Probably one of your nut-ball
friends. - Don't think so.

03:53.440 --> 03:57.513
Fabric at the scene was cotton with synthetic polymers
- dye, olive green.

03:57.600 --> 04:02.037
This dude was wearing a military
uniform. He's one of yours, not mine.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.635
<i>OK. His name is Devon Marshall.</i>

04:05.720 --> 04:09.315
- He served in the Guard with Kent.
- What?

04:09.400 --> 04:12.392
He was there in MosuI,
the night Kent was killed.

04:12.480 --> 04:16.995
- He was protesting?
- Marshall could've had a change of heart.

04:17.079 --> 04:21.197
Or it was survivor guilt. The guy
who saved his life didn't make it.

04:21.279 --> 04:23.555
You can't imagine what that's like.

04:23.640 --> 04:29.875
I don't think so. There's evidence of
damage on the auditory meatus. Here and here.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.394
I'm sorry, but I left
my phrase book at home.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.711
The opening where the auditory
nerves feed into the brain.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.916
- So we're talking ear hole?
- Yes!

04:38.000 --> 04:42.835
- They simplify these words for a reason.
- Something was jabbed into his ear.

04:42.920 --> 04:45.036
OK, that's clear. But why?

04:45.120 --> 04:50.069
There's scrapings in the cranium, and marks
on the inside of the parietaI and occipitaI.

04:50.160 --> 04:53.789
Whatever was used was pushed
completely through his skull.

04:53.880 --> 04:57.839
They then set the fire so there'd be
no tissue to see what had been done.

04:57.920 --> 05:04.439
Exactly. Devon Marshall didn't die
in the fire. He was murdered first.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:39.520 --> 05:44.116
Marshall was against the war. He'd look like
a protester so no one would expect murder.

05:44.200 --> 05:48.796
As far as anyone knows, this is still a suicide.
I want the killer to think he got away with it.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.677
He's smart. I want the edge.

05:50.760 --> 05:56.676
OK, Zack, magnify the marks on the cranium.
Call if you match them to any kind of weapon.

05:56.760 --> 06:01.231
I'm just asking his mother questions. You
could've stayed back, played with your bones.

06:01.320 --> 06:05.472
- I know. Just wanted to keep you company.
- Company?

06:05.560 --> 06:10.076
- Yeah. I'm trying to be more sociable.
- Lousy liar.

06:10.160 --> 06:15.996
I just think inside you're still military,
Booth. You might be too close to this one.

06:16.080 --> 06:19.629
- I just want to make sure you stay objective.
- I know how to do my job.

06:19.720 --> 06:24.669
- I was doing itjust fine long before I met you.
- You're angry.

06:24.760 --> 06:29.276
Because I have people with opinions on war
who don't know what they're talking about!

06:29.360 --> 06:33.512
I've been in Sudan, Rwanda. For two months,
I sifted through the wreckage of 9/11

06:33.600 --> 06:35.591
helping the families of the victims.

06:35.680 --> 06:40.800
AII I'm saying is that this is just another
case. That's all. It's just another case.

06:40.880 --> 06:44.634
<i>You're not such a great liar yourself.</i>

06:44.720 --> 06:46.995
I'm your partner.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.435
Let me be your partner.

06:53.080 --> 06:58.677
Did he have any troubles since he
came back? Any personaI problems?

06:59.400 --> 07:01.391
Some days...

07:03.680 --> 07:08.231
I didn't know him. He used
to be very outgoing, happy.

07:08.320 --> 07:12.393
But since he came back, all he did
was spend time with his little sister -

07:12.480 --> 07:14.789
take her to schooI,
help with her homework.

07:14.880 --> 07:21.228
He said his job now was keeping me safe, but
most of the time I was taking care of him.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.275
It was like he was scared all the time.

07:24.360 --> 07:29.434
Did he, uh... did he talk, you know,
to anyone else that he served with?

07:29.520 --> 07:36.073
Just Jimmy. He talked to him when
Jimmy wasn't in the hospitaI. The VA.

07:36.160 --> 07:40.278
When he was over there he really
believed in what he was doing.

07:40.360 --> 07:46.151
He wrote us all the time saying how
good he felt seeing the people free.

07:46.240 --> 07:51.519
Voting. Because he remembered
when his grandpa was a young man...

07:53.520 --> 07:56.353
he didn't have the right to vote.

07:56.440 --> 07:59.955
When can I have my son back?
When can I lay him to rest?

08:00.440 --> 08:05.150
Soon, Mrs Marshall. We just want
to make sure we have all the facts.

08:18.760 --> 08:23.311
I know it's his sister, but it's odd for a
man to spend so much time with a 13-year-old.

08:23.400 --> 08:27.996
It's still all over you. You want to
be around something pure, innocent.

08:28.080 --> 08:32.119
Adults want you to relive it. They want
war stories like they're entertainment.

08:32.200 --> 08:36.909
If they hear you survived, then maybe war isn't so bad
- John Wayne syndrome.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.309
- You gonna trash the Duke?
- You kidding? I love the Duke.

08:40.400 --> 08:44.154
<i>- I wouldn't have guessed, "little lady".
- Remember Stagecoach?</i>

08:44.240 --> 08:48.028
"Courage is being scared to
death, but saddling up anyway. "

08:48.120 --> 08:52.318
- Was that the Duke? It was like Jerry Lewis.
- Was not.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.920
Just a couple of quick questions, Jimmy.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.629
<i>I... I... I can't... I can't
talk about Devon now, man.</i>

09:01.720 --> 09:07.317
- Leave him alone. He's got enough troubles.
- I understand. OK? It's...

09:07.400 --> 09:11.359
Readjusting takes time. It's
different for every one of us.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.715
It sure as hell was different for Devon.

09:13.800 --> 09:18.078
He's gone, man. Son of a bitch should've
never checked out on me like that.

09:18.160 --> 09:22.278
That's when Jimmy came back in here
- when he heard about Devon.

09:22.360 --> 09:28.435
- He was doing pretty good before that.
- I can't hold ajob or provide for my family.

09:28.520 --> 09:33.230
- Did you and Devon ever argue?
- We stuck together. It's what it was all about.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.788
Devon would call and
Jimmy would go meet him.

09:35.880 --> 09:39.236
Middle of dinner, playing
with Sarah, it didn't matter.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.117
He needed me, Karen.

09:41.200 --> 09:46.274
Man, you know what it's like when you return.
You got no one but the guys you served with.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.749
You and Devon would visit
CorporaI Kent's grave site?

09:52.840 --> 09:56.389
It never should've happened
like that. Not to Kent.

09:56.480 --> 09:59.597
We would go and tell
him that we were sorry.

09:59.680 --> 10:03.195
- We needed him to know.
- I understand.

10:03.280 --> 10:06.556
I don't. How did it happen, Jimmy?

10:06.640 --> 10:09.154
It doesn't matter, Bones.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.356
- But, Booth...
- We'll see you later, OK?

10:11.440 --> 10:15.479
At home. He'll be at home
next time with me and the kids.

10:15.560 --> 10:18.632
<i>- Right, Jimmy?
- Yeah.</i>

10:24.120 --> 10:26.714
- Jimmy didn't kill him.
- Now you're a mind reader.

10:26.800 --> 10:30.395
- Maybe. Want me to guess your weight?
- You do and you could lose a tooth.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.268
Stay objective. Jimmy was one of
the last people to see Devon alive.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.635
Jimmy could've killed him.

10:36.720 --> 10:41.236
- I thought you didn't like speculation.
- I don't. That's why I took this.

10:41.320 --> 10:46.030
Cigarette butt. See if we can pull any DNA
from it, match it to anything he left on Devon.

10:46.120 --> 10:50.955
- You got what you need. Why give me grief?
- Because you could've been tougher in there.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.873
- I'm tough.
- Most of the time.

10:55.560 --> 10:59.519
- Do you always have to get the last word in?
- I like to. Yeah.

10:59.960 --> 11:03.032
Booth! Son of a bitch.

11:03.120 --> 11:07.716
- Hank, hey! How the hell are you, man?
- Great. I just got some new wheels.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.633
Sweet ride. Hank Latrell,
Dr Temperance Brennan.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.870
- Oh, the bone lady.
- That's me.

11:12.960 --> 11:16.032
Booth and I were in
the same unit in Kosovo.

11:16.120 --> 11:19.669
You gotta come over for dinner.
The kids keep asking about you.

11:19.760 --> 11:24.914
- I'd love to. I'll call. We'll make it a date.
- Great. I gotta roll. I gotta be in court at three.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.560
- They can't start without the judge.
- I'll call.

11:27.640 --> 11:31.030
Hey, call me or I'm gonna kick your ass.

11:32.520 --> 11:35.512
- What happened to him?
- He got hurt.

11:37.160 --> 11:41.233
There are signs of additionaI damage
on C1 at the base of the skull.

11:41.320 --> 11:44.232
This couldn't have come from
the assault in the cranium.

11:44.320 --> 11:48.836
- Booth went through something over there.
- So I'm not supposed to tell the truth?

11:48.920 --> 11:50.911
Truth? It's opinion, Jack.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.639
Looks like a dimple in
the bone. Could be genetic.

11:53.720 --> 11:59.192
- There were no WMDs. That's the truth.
- All intelligence agencies thought there were.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.511
We should magnify the area
to see what else caused it.

12:02.600 --> 12:06.559
- Are you defending what's going on?
- No. Mistakes were made... obviously.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.234
Yeah. Like establishing
military bases there,

12:09.320 --> 12:13.359
instead of investing a fraction of what
this war cost into alternative energy.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.795
- Nothing is that simple.
- To me it is!

12:15.880 --> 12:19.839
- We're ruled by the corporate oligarchy.
- There's also discolouration.

12:19.920 --> 12:23.515
- You should do scrapings.
- Wanna make the world a better place?

12:23.600 --> 12:30.199
Shut your yap long enough to hear something
other than the sound of your own voice.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.396
Hey, where are you going?

12:32.480 --> 12:34.391
The scrapings? Huh?

12:34.480 --> 12:36.630
Oh, yeah.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.756
I thought we were having a good time.

12:39.080 --> 12:43.596
A pleasure. You've helped us with casualties
we never thought we'd be able to ID.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.319
- Someday I won't be needed.
- That's what we hope.

12:46.400 --> 12:50.393
Captain Fuller, give Agent Booth and
Dr Brennan all the help they need.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.471
Please.

12:52.560 --> 12:56.712
So, this is your third
tour in Iraq, Captain?

12:56.800 --> 13:00.349
Yes. A NationaI Guard unit
can be difficult to lead.

13:00.440 --> 13:05.798
Nothing against the Guard, but usually they're
inexperienced, short-changed on equipment.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.952
But Kent's unit, they were
one of the best I ever had.

13:09.040 --> 13:12.510
- And Devon Marshall?
- Marshall was a good soldier.

13:12.600 --> 13:17.310
But after he came back, he seemed to turn
against the military. Saw us as the problem.

13:17.400 --> 13:21.678
- You must've known men like that.
- Some people just aren't cut out for it.

13:21.760 --> 13:26.231
- Like Jimmy Martin.
- He's had troubles, but he still supports us.

13:26.320 --> 13:30.552
Marshall and Jimmy seemed like they
had trouble getting over Kent's death.

13:30.640 --> 13:35.111
Any idea why it was so tough
for them? Tougher than usuaI?

13:38.480 --> 13:40.471
We were on a patroI in MosuI.

13:41.280 --> 13:46.638
InteI reports indicated there were
insurgents there. We were canvassing the area.

13:46.720 --> 13:52.113
<i>Private Campbell stayed in the Humvee as the
unit headed to a small house up the street.</i>

13:52.200 --> 13:57.399
<i>There were five of us: Kent,
Marshall, Martin, Leferts, myself.</i>

13:57.480 --> 13:59.869
<i>It was a small house, two rooms.</i>

13:59.960 --> 14:04.431
<i>I looked through a slat and saw three
insurgents in the back room. One a woman.</i>

14:04.520 --> 14:09.514
<i>The men had AK-47s. I sent Kent and Leferts
to cover the back so no one could run.</i>

14:09.600 --> 14:13.718
<i>I was getting the others into position
when one insurgent must've spotted Kent.</i>

14:13.800 --> 14:16.360
<i>I heard the pop-pop-pop
of the enemy AK-47.</i>

14:16.440 --> 14:20.228
<i>Kent made entry to take them out
before they could get to the rest of us.</i>

14:20.320 --> 14:23.437
<i>Leferts followed 'em in while
we kicked in the front door.</i>

14:23.520 --> 14:28.913
<i>When we got to them, Kent had already
been killed taking out the insurgents.</i>

14:29.000 --> 14:34.472
<i>A sight like that stays with you. For two
part-timers like that, I guess it was too much.</i>

14:35.200 --> 14:41.116
But whatever Marshall was trying to do
desecrating Kent's grave, Kent saved the unit.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.714
Marshall can't take that away.

14:44.200 --> 14:47.875
Devon Marshall was murdered, Captain.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.712
God.

14:49.800 --> 14:54.032
- Any bad blood between him and Martin?
- Not that I know of.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.271
We only have the after-action
summary of the incident.

14:57.360 --> 15:01.876
I'd like to have the full report,
Kent's autopsy, the photos of the scene,

15:01.960 --> 15:04.474
and any other evidence that exists.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.756
You'll have whatever you need.

15:08.320 --> 15:12.677
- I thought we'd keep the murder to ourselves.
- He's a commander. A decorated officer.

15:12.760 --> 15:17.311
- And a soldier wouldn't kill someone?
- Now it's yourjob to question their motives?

15:17.400 --> 15:20.472
No. It's my job to solve
a murder. Yours, too.

15:20.560 --> 15:24.473
Treat him like you would anyone
else involved in an investigation.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.755
You're not in the military any more.

15:26.840 --> 15:30.799
I will find out who killed Devon
Marshall. That's all you need to know.

15:33.280 --> 15:38.559
- How's Booth doing?
- He's angry. I think I said some things.

15:38.640 --> 15:41.598
- Sweetie...
- He wasn't being objective.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.319
I just had to get him to focus.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.119
- You have to think before you speak.
- Why?

15:47.200 --> 15:49.998
I can say anything to you
without thinking first.

15:50.080 --> 15:54.232
Men aren't like us. They're
much more fragile and needy.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.835
<i>The fact they think we're needy
is a testament to our superiority.</i>

15:57.920 --> 16:00.150
Yeah. I guess I forgot.

16:00.240 --> 16:04.233
Dr Brennan, the military delivered
all the paperwork you requested.

16:04.320 --> 16:07.357
Kent's autopsy report is
careless and incomplete.

16:07.440 --> 16:12.230
There was no incision, no x-rays so no way to
confirm the amount of bullets he was hit with.

16:12.320 --> 16:17.314
The ME marked seven entry points, but the
report says there were only six bullets.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.073
I could've done better with a Crayola.

16:20.440 --> 16:24.877
MedicaI records are done on the fly
in combat situation, not falsified.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.155
Booth, the report is a mess.

16:27.240 --> 16:31.836
Ange, input these photos and enhance
them for as much detaiI as possible.

16:31.920 --> 16:35.356
No flesh from Marshall's ear. I
sent anything usefuI to Pathology

16:35.440 --> 16:39.672
to see if they can match anything with
the DNA from Jimmy Martin's cigarette.

16:39.760 --> 16:44.197
- Were you really mad before?
- Why? Because of your paranoid ramblings?

16:44.280 --> 16:48.990
I'm guessing mad. Fair enough. Can I
at least give you some materiaI to read?

16:49.080 --> 16:52.868
You could try, but you'd
walk funny for a week.

16:52.960 --> 16:56.509
I'd better work on
these scrapings for Zack.

16:56.600 --> 17:01.833
This is a murder. We know Devon would
visit Kent's grave, Jimmy said to apologise.

17:01.920 --> 17:08.519
He knew something about Kent, Booth.
Something these reports will never tell us.

17:08.599 --> 17:10.636
So what do you want to do?

17:10.720 --> 17:13.314
- I want to exhume Charles Kent.
- Exhume a war hero?

17:13.400 --> 17:17.837
- Do you have any idea what you're asking?
- It's the only way to know what happened.

17:17.920 --> 17:20.309
- The report.
- Which is sloppy and incomplete.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.756
He is supposed to be honoured
this week, not humiliated.

17:23.839 --> 17:27.388
Doesn't Devon Marshall deserve as
much respect and honour as Kent?

17:27.480 --> 17:32.429
- I'm sorry, Bones. I can't let you do this.
- I'm not asking for your permission, Booth.

17:32.520 --> 17:37.514
I can get the court order on my own. I
was just kind of hoping for your support.

17:50.200 --> 17:54.478
- Agent Booth, I'm Tina Kent.
- Listen, ma'am. I'm very sor...

18:18.280 --> 18:20.475
It's a Silver Star.

18:22.640 --> 18:27.236
- I know how much you hate this, Booth.
- Let's just get it over with, all right?

18:27.320 --> 18:32.633
OK, I want a full set of x-rays and a
clear picture of all fracture patterns.

18:32.720 --> 18:36.076
And a tox screen and analysis of
any particulates in the wounds.

18:36.160 --> 18:40.631
- DOD wants it done fast and out of the press.
- It will take the time it takes to do properly.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.871
Run scenarios on angles and
the entry order of the shots.

18:43.960 --> 18:47.270
Yeah. I should be able
to give you something.

18:47.360 --> 18:53.674
I know we don't see eye to eye on a lot cos
politically we live in an Orwellian nightmare...

18:53.760 --> 18:56.558
What... what are you trying to say?

18:57.480 --> 19:01.109
Just... I'm sorry, man.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.191
I really am.

19:08.880 --> 19:13.317
I'll need x-rays of L1
through 4 and the left scapula.

19:14.880 --> 19:19.635
- He's just a kid.
- Anthropologists theorise that wars break out

19:19.720 --> 19:25.397
when there's an increase in the population
of unmarried men under the age of 25.

19:26.520 --> 19:31.992
I'm sorry. I need to create a distance from the
victim. It's how I deaI. I... I didn't mean...

19:32.080 --> 19:37.154
Just, you know, do what you have
to do. I'm gonna go do my thing.

19:38.800 --> 19:42.873
I should've been with Kent, man. Maybe
I could've shielded him, you know?

19:42.960 --> 19:46.748
But the captain, he put me
and Devon on the front door.

19:46.840 --> 19:50.435
By the time we got to
Kent, it was too late.

19:50.520 --> 19:55.196
- What did you see from where you were?
- Oh, no. I don't need to go through that again.

19:55.280 --> 20:00.718
- The captain told you. You read the report.
- Come on, Jimmy. Please.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.997
This is for Kent and Devon.

20:09.200 --> 20:13.398
It was the first action we
saw. Man, nobody was ready.

20:15.400 --> 20:19.791
We were outside the front door
sweating in the heat, just waiting.

20:19.880 --> 20:25.989
- What's the first thing you heard? -
First? The pop-pop-pop from the enemy AK.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.991
And all hell broke loose.

20:28.480 --> 20:31.199
<i>We broke down the door and made entry.</i>

20:31.280 --> 20:35.717
<i>Those people, the Iraqi ones, they were
already dead when we got to the back room.</i>

20:35.800 --> 20:39.873
<i>Kent, too. Leferts standing
over him all freaked.</i>

20:39.960 --> 20:44.636
<i>We were all freaked, man. These
were real people, you know?</i>

20:44.720 --> 20:48.156
- Did you see them firing on Kent?
- No. But like I said,

20:48.240 --> 20:51.471
it took time to kick in the door
and push through to the back room.

20:51.560 --> 20:53.949
If I'd got there faster, I...

20:56.000 --> 20:59.879
There was nothing I could
do, you know? I swear.

21:02.480 --> 21:06.792
- Six of the bullets are still in the remains.
- I need to see which entries were fataI.

21:06.880 --> 21:11.078
- Anything more on Devon Marshall?
- Still working on the dimple on his neck.

21:11.160 --> 21:15.597
Set up a trace so we can
start extracting the bullets.

21:16.320 --> 21:20.552
Find anything in the wounds that might
have changed the trajectory of the bullets?

21:20.640 --> 21:25.191
Not yet. Just residuaI sesquioxide
and silica accumulation.

21:25.280 --> 21:29.319
A little decayed organic matter.
Probably food that was on the floor. So...

21:29.400 --> 21:31.868
- Thank you.
- Look, Angela...

21:33.360 --> 21:38.354
I run on sometimes, I know. I guess I think if
I yell loud enough maybe someone will listen.

21:38.440 --> 21:41.876
You have to be carefuI
people don't go deaf.

21:43.320 --> 21:50.556
You know, what you did for Booth before -
showing him you understood - that was good.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.712
<i>Everyone hears something like that.</i>

22:01.560 --> 22:04.791
I joined the Guard cos they
helped pay for medicaI schooI.

22:04.880 --> 22:09.670
All my life I wanted to be a
doctor. It's all I ever wanted.

22:09.760 --> 22:12.877
I never thought I'd get sent
overseas, much less Iraq.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.918
Your service record is exemplary.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.275
I survived.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.633
That's my achievement.

22:22.720 --> 22:30.593
I'm sorry to do this, Miss Campbell. I'm just
trying to reconstruct the night of the firefight.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.150
I was parked in the alley.

22:37.360 --> 22:42.275
The captain told me to stay in the Humvee.
Women can't engage in direct combat.

22:43.680 --> 22:46.148
<i>He took the unit to the house.</i>

22:46.240 --> 22:48.800
<i>The street was quiet. I was waiting.</i>

22:48.880 --> 22:52.111
Then I heard the
pop-pop-pop of the AK-47.

22:52.720 --> 22:59.273
Then Kent and Leferts firing. The captain
and the others breaking down the door.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.237
Then everything stopped.

23:01.840 --> 23:06.630
<i>It went quiet again. Then the captain
came back, told me Kent had been hit.</i>

23:06.720 --> 23:12.909
<i>He knew I was a med student, so he sent
me in while he radioed for a medevac.</i>

23:13.000 --> 23:17.516
<i>As an intern, I've seen
a lot of horrible things.</i>

23:19.680 --> 23:25.073
But when it's your friend...
someone you serve with...

23:30.440 --> 23:32.476
Yeah.

23:32.560 --> 23:36.917
Been in the Guard for years. Didn't think
I'd ever get called up again. I mean, I'm 45.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.309
There's just not enough
men for this mess.

23:39.400 --> 23:43.393
Look, Mr Leferts, if we could just...

23:50.920 --> 23:53.912
We were 22 hours

23:54.000 --> 23:56.116
into a 12-hour detaiI.

23:56.760 --> 23:59.593
You try that when it's 110 degrees out.

24:02.080 --> 24:05.959
They called me Dad
because I was the old guy.

24:06.360 --> 24:09.432
<i>Kent was the kid. Captain
sent us around back.</i>

24:09.520 --> 24:14.275
<i>I was supposed to look out for him. It got
like I really was the damn kid's father.</i>

24:14.360 --> 24:17.477
Kent was gung ho, you know?

24:17.560 --> 24:20.472
Would've fought the
whole damn war himself.

24:21.480 --> 24:24.517
So, he sees something move inside.

24:24.600 --> 24:28.036
<i>Something shines off the
light. A barrel, he says.</i>

24:28.120 --> 24:33.478
Then we hear people moving around,
somebody coming towards us from inside.

24:33.760 --> 24:37.833
- Then somebody fires.
- What did it sound like? The shots.

24:37.920 --> 24:40.150
It was like
a pop-pop-pop.

24:40.240 --> 24:44.916
<i>Then Kent rushes in, sees
the first guy. Blows him away.</i>

24:45.000 --> 24:48.390
He wasn't supposed to go
in by himself, so I rush in.

24:48.480 --> 24:53.270
I take out the last guy,
and then it all stops.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.557
<i>And when it does, Kent is lying there.</i>

24:59.160 --> 25:03.073
I can't believe it! I'm...
I'm... I'm staring down at Kent.

25:03.160 --> 25:08.154
<i>And then the others, they
ask, "What happened, Dad?"</i>

25:08.240 --> 25:10.674
<i>"Dad, what happened?"</i>

25:12.120 --> 25:16.398
And I'm staring down at Kent
like he really is my kid.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.071
I'm a lawyer!

25:22.600 --> 25:25.160
A damn lawyer.

25:25.240 --> 25:30.314
I shouldn't have been there.
None of us should've been there.

25:34.440 --> 25:37.750
- Their stories don't line up.
- You said the events seem consistent.

25:37.840 --> 25:41.549
Exactly. We got a group of traumatised
soldiers who all say the same words

25:41.640 --> 25:44.438
to describe the first
shots: "pop-pop-pop".

25:44.520 --> 25:46.511
It was rehearsed.

25:47.120 --> 25:50.112
- They're hiding something.
- That makes sense.

25:52.160 --> 25:57.598
- There's something Devon knew about.
- And someone else didn't want to get out.

26:01.920 --> 26:05.435
- That's all of them.
- The way the blood pooled round the bullets,

26:05.520 --> 26:08.034
these three were the
ones that killed him.

26:08.120 --> 26:11.078
These rounds aren't
from an AK-47. These are.

26:11.160 --> 26:14.835
They didn't kill him. Circulation
had stopped when these bullets hit.

26:14.920 --> 26:21.075
Wait. The ones that killed him are from an M
-... 14. Those are from our weapons.

26:22.680 --> 26:25.717
- Friendly fire.
- Oh, God.

26:25.800 --> 26:29.475
- Booth...
- You know what? Let's find out who did this.

26:29.560 --> 26:34.873
Not all personneI carry the same weapons.
We have to find out who was issued the M-14.

26:41.440 --> 26:45.274
- Leferts was the only one issued
an M-14. - So Kent runs in firing.

26:45.360 --> 26:51.993
The insurgents fire back. Leferts follows
Kent in. Leferts is shooting and he kills Kent.

26:52.080 --> 26:56.596
Devon wanted to tell the truth but Leferts has a legaI practice
- too much to lose.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.955
Leferts kills Devon.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.031
Son of a...

27:19.640 --> 27:22.473
"I shot Kent that night. I'm sorry. "

27:22.560 --> 27:26.792
"I didn't mean to, but I
can't live with it any more. "

27:26.880 --> 27:30.589
His assistant says he was out of
town the night Devon Marshall died.

27:30.680 --> 27:33.148
He couldn't have killed him.

27:33.240 --> 27:36.471
The murderer's still out there, Booth.

27:39.840 --> 27:42.559
Devon Marshall was too badly burned.

27:42.640 --> 27:46.792
Hodgins couldn't get enough usable tissue
to match the DNA from Martin's cigarette.

27:46.880 --> 27:51.476
And the one person who had a motive killed
himself but he couldn't have killed Marshall.

27:51.560 --> 27:56.873
- ME confirmed suicide?
- Yeah. Plus no one was in or out of the office.

27:56.960 --> 28:02.557
- He definitely killed himself.
- But we still have no idea who killed Devon.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.598
<i>Agent Booth?</i>

28:05.680 --> 28:07.671
Mr Kent.

28:08.600 --> 28:12.070
- This is Dr Brennan.
- I know.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.799
I'm sorry I exhumed your
son, sir. But we needed...

28:14.880 --> 28:20.273
No, please. Thank you. It's important
for us to find out how he died.

28:20.840 --> 28:25.550
- Do you want to sit?
- No. I just wanted to ask.

28:25.640 --> 28:29.349
There's conflicting stories. Now
the captain says he can't talk to us.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.238
I just wanted to ask
you to find the truth.

28:32.320 --> 28:36.598
My wife and I can't live not
knowing what happened to Charlie.

28:36.680 --> 28:38.636
We need the truth.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.391
Of course.

28:46.880 --> 28:50.270
- I can't talk to the family. This is ongoing.
- Convenient.

28:50.360 --> 28:53.557
Bones! You had no idea
this was friendly fire?

28:53.640 --> 28:58.589
- If I had, I would've reported it.
- There are inconsistencies in the report.

28:58.680 --> 29:02.468
You're good at yourjob, but you don't
know the first thing about combat.

29:02.560 --> 29:06.758
We were taking fire. One of my men
was killed. The area wasn't secured.

29:06.840 --> 29:10.674
Do you think I count bullets and
draw pictures? You've been through it.

29:10.760 --> 29:16.039
Does it ever go the way you want it to?
Is it ever the way it should be in combat?

29:16.120 --> 29:19.715
We have to ask these questions.
It's a murder investigation.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.951
And I'll cooperate. I don't want
more of my men to die either.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.838
Now, if there's nothing else...

29:30.440 --> 29:33.477
Got something. A splinter pattern.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.791
Wood particles blew back into
an exit wound from the AK-47s.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.279
The missing bullet.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.909
He wasn't near wood when shot.
He was in the middle of the room.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.595
- No. He was on the floor.
- Someone stood over him

29:45.680 --> 29:50.037
and squeezed off some rounds from
an AK-47 after he was already dead.

29:50.120 --> 29:53.430
The missing round passed through
him and into the wood floor.

29:53.520 --> 29:58.640
But all the insurgents had already been
killed. They were the only ones with AK-47s.

29:58.720 --> 30:03.316
I hate to say "conspiracy", but,
my peeps, we've got a conspiracy.

30:03.400 --> 30:08.872
Someone covered up the incident by making
it look like he was killed by insurgents.

30:08.960 --> 30:11.918
Angela, enhance all
pictures of the aftermath

30:12.000 --> 30:15.913
so we can see body positions,
bullet holes, damage to the house.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.912
I want to reconstruct
what happened that night.

30:22.360 --> 30:26.638
Look at us. You with a badge, me in the
courtroom, both trying to find justice.

30:26.720 --> 30:29.280
- That's why we fought.
- That's what they told us.

30:29.360 --> 30:32.352
- You don't believe it?
- Sure I do.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.549
<i>You don't look like you do.</i>

30:36.640 --> 30:40.872
- You're not gambling again, are you?
- No, man. Nah, I've been good.

30:40.960 --> 30:45.431
I've been going to my meetings. I
haven't even played a game of Monopoly.

30:45.520 --> 30:49.229
Hey, listen, Hank. I have this case.

30:49.320 --> 30:51.311
Charles Kent.

30:52.440 --> 30:54.431
- It's a
friendly-fire. - God.

30:54.520 --> 31:00.914
Yeah. Covered up. Two other members
of the squad are dead. One murdered.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.833
Whatever went down
must've been pretty ugly.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.671
You know, Hank...

31:09.280 --> 31:12.113
You know what we did?

31:13.040 --> 31:16.589
- Don't go there, Booth.
- Was it worth it? I mean, look at you.

31:16.680 --> 31:20.070
You saved my life. I got a
great family because of you.

31:20.160 --> 31:25.075
- Yeah, but why was it always a secret?
- We were given a choice.

31:25.160 --> 31:29.119
- They always gave us a choice.
- Yeah, but that last time...

31:30.400 --> 31:33.278
Well, you knew what was at stake.

31:33.360 --> 31:35.510
Yeah... Yeah.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.950
You never talked to anybody about it?

31:42.080 --> 31:44.116
You've got to.

31:44.200 --> 31:48.193
- How about your girlfriend? That doctor?
- No, she's just my partner.

31:48.280 --> 31:53.229
- You know, look, I got work. I should go.
- Sure.

31:53.320 --> 31:58.599
- We're on for Sunday dinner, right?
- Yeah. See you Sunday. Bye.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.675
<i>I want to see all the walls. Can
you scan them for bullet holes?</i>

32:05.760 --> 32:09.673
Single out the ones that
came from Leferts' weapon.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.399
This is hard for Booth. He's idealistic.

32:12.480 --> 32:15.950
It's nice to know somebody
that wants to keep honour alive.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.838
I feeI like Booth thinks I'm
taking that away from him.

32:18.920 --> 32:26.076
OK, it says, "Insurgent A opened fire
when he saw Kent. And Kent took him out. "

32:26.160 --> 32:28.151
Let's see A again?

32:28.800 --> 32:32.395
- You're just doing yourjob. He knows that.
- I guess.

32:32.480 --> 32:35.870
- Magnify his hands.
- What are you looking for?

32:35.960 --> 32:40.954
His hands are splayed like he was shielding
himself from the rounds coming at him.

32:41.040 --> 32:44.828
Cadaveric spasm
- the muscles became rigid when he died.

32:44.920 --> 32:48.037
- He might not have held that weapon.
- What do you mean?

32:48.120 --> 32:50.190
Show me insurgent B.

32:53.520 --> 32:59.231
I tell Booth we're on the same side. I'm
not disillusioning him. It's my findings.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.914
But when I look at him, I...

33:02.000 --> 33:05.788
<i>- I don't know what else I can do.
- I do.</i>

33:07.320 --> 33:09.629
- Ange.
- As a friend, Brennan.

33:09.720 --> 33:14.316
Yeah. That whole "friends with
benefits" thing, that's not happening.

33:14.400 --> 33:19.315
I'm not talking about that. I'm
talking about being there for him.

33:19.400 --> 33:23.712
Knowing when a simple touch is enough.

33:24.520 --> 33:28.798
Maybe I could write him a note.
I can be very articulate on paper.

33:28.880 --> 33:30.472
Zoom in.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.829
OK, magnify the blood smear.

33:36.360 --> 33:41.115
Well, you can see by the smear he was
moved, turned, that gun placed next to him.

33:41.200 --> 33:47.389
- OK, show me C.
- OK, this is the third insurgent woman,

33:47.480 --> 33:50.790
about 40, holding the
unexploded grenade in her hand.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.916
Magnify her torso.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.838
<i>Wait, she's Iying on a dinner plate.</i>

33:58.920 --> 34:03.630
And the serving spoon is next to her.
She'd been holding it when she was shot.

34:03.720 --> 34:06.632
- And a grenade?
- Found anything yet?

34:06.720 --> 34:10.315
Yeah. None of these people were
armed when Kent went in there.

34:10.400 --> 34:14.154
All of the weapons were
planted on them after they died.

34:14.239 --> 34:17.630
Fuller's unit killed an unarmed family.

34:24.199 --> 34:26.998
- Kent shot unarmed people?
- They look like a family.

34:27.080 --> 34:29.071
About to sit down to dinner.

34:29.159 --> 34:34.029
- Any other questionable operations?
- None. They did six months without incident.

34:34.120 --> 34:35.996
How could it have happened?

34:36.080 --> 34:40.312
The woman was going to the back door.
Kent maybe thought the spoon was a weapon.

34:40.400 --> 34:44.188
- A spoon?
- It's dark. It happens. He's inexperienced.

34:44.280 --> 34:47.237
He's scared. You only have
an instant to make a choice.

34:47.320 --> 34:51.074
Kent probably thought he was
being attacked, so he burst in.

34:51.159 --> 34:53.879
From the spray pattern, he
was shooting as he entered.

34:53.960 --> 34:58.192
<i>He must've killed the woman first. The
others as they rushed to the woman to help.</i>

34:58.280 --> 35:02.512
He probably thought they were attacking,
too. Leferts hears firing. He goes in.

35:02.600 --> 35:07.151
<i>Kent turns, weapon still pointed.
Leferts shoots, killing Kent.</i>

35:08.000 --> 35:11.276
- All happens in seconds.
- But if Kent turned to face him...

35:11.360 --> 35:16.514
It doesn't matter. After all the shooting,
all Leferts sees is a weapon pointing at him.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.751
- He just reacted.
- God.

35:19.840 --> 35:23.355
So this was more than a
friendly-fire incident.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.712
Hell of a lot more.

35:27.880 --> 35:30.519
You son of a bitch! You
covered up the whole thing!

35:30.600 --> 35:32.556
- Stand down!
- They were innocents!

35:32.640 --> 35:38.158
- My report clearly states...
- We've taken it apart! We have facts, Captain!

35:38.240 --> 35:42.711
- Your squad blew away a family of innocents!
- Kent! Kent did!

35:42.800 --> 35:48.158
A kid so green he never should've been
there. Do you know what that town was like?

35:48.240 --> 35:53.360
Our guys were getting blown up every day
while we tried to build hospitals and schools.

35:53.440 --> 35:58.958
A mistake was made. No one likes
it. But you know what happens.

35:59.040 --> 36:03.795
If it got out what we did, that neighbourhood,
the whole damn city would've exploded.

36:03.880 --> 36:07.555
What would you have done? Would
you have let the city burn?

36:07.640 --> 36:09.995
This can't come out, Agent Booth.

36:10.080 --> 36:14.073
Don't make this any harder
with an ugly story like this.

36:14.160 --> 36:17.994
I don't know what you're fighting for,
Fuller, but it sure wasn't my country.

36:18.080 --> 36:22.198
- We'll start with obstruction ofjustice.
- You have no jurisdiction here.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.714
<i>But we do, Captain.</i>

36:24.800 --> 36:27.155
We're cooperating
fully with Agent Booth.

36:27.240 --> 36:32.189
You will not disgrace us, Captain.
You will be held accountable.

36:34.840 --> 36:37.070
<i>Marshall's killer is still free.</i>

36:37.160 --> 36:40.994
Fuller placed weapons on the Iraqis,
pressured the others to be quiet,

36:41.080 --> 36:44.629
but he still has an alibi for
the night of Marshall's murder.

36:44.720 --> 36:47.518
Zack found discolouration
on Devon's vertebrae.

36:47.600 --> 36:51.798
It's caused by residue left from
pethidene, an opiate known as DemeroI.

36:51.880 --> 36:58.194
Someone jabbed a syringe into his neck,
creating the indentation in the bone.

36:58.280 --> 37:03.912
He was made unconscious, so the instrument
was placed into his ear without a struggle.

37:04.000 --> 37:09.552
- A nine-inch surgicaI curette like this. -
It's someone with access to tools and drugs.

37:09.640 --> 37:12.359
Someone the army sent to medicaI schooI.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.391
All done.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.749
He was gonna tell.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.797
I...

37:36.120 --> 37:41.148
It's like the war was still going
on. I was just trying to survive.

37:43.960 --> 37:46.269
<i>Forward march!</i>

38:03.760 --> 38:07.275
My boy was just trying
to do the right thing.

38:10.600 --> 38:13.273
Thank you for letting people see that.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.156
You can be proud of him.

38:33.600 --> 38:39.118
- I would never have expected to see that.
- Well, people will always surprise you.

38:39.200 --> 38:42.476
That hasn't always been my experience.

38:45.640 --> 38:48.029
I've done some things.

38:50.160 --> 38:52.674
- I know.
- No. You don't.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.310
But it's OK.

38:56.400 --> 39:01.269
Well, not... not as a secret. It's not.

39:01.360 --> 39:06.798
I have to be, uh,
honest... about myself.

39:06.880 --> 39:09.838
I have to be able to tell someone.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.990
You will in time, Booth.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.350
You will.

39:22.920 --> 39:25.480
I was sent to Kosovo.

39:26.360 --> 39:31.957
There was this Serb, GeneraI Radik,

39:32.040 --> 39:37.433
who led a unit, who would go into
villages and, you know, destroy 'em.

39:37.520 --> 39:43.311
Women, children, all... all killed because
he wanted to ethnically purify his country.

39:43.400 --> 39:48.076
He'd done this twice before.
I mean, we had facts, proof.

39:49.320 --> 39:54.792
232 people just erased.

39:55.840 --> 39:58.434
I was the sniper...

40:01.480 --> 40:04.074
sent in to stop him.

40:05.160 --> 40:08.357
He was set to leave
in a couple of hours.

40:09.960 --> 40:11.951
It was his son's...

40:12.600 --> 40:14.591
son's birthday.

40:15.200 --> 40:17.395
A little boy...

40:17.480 --> 40:20.358
maybe about six or seven.

40:21.280 --> 40:26.877
I can still hear the music from the party,
you know? That song just playing in my head.

40:28.000 --> 40:33.028
Nobody knew where the shot came
from, but they knew why it came.

40:33.120 --> 40:35.918
They said I saved over 100 people.

40:36.840 --> 40:40.958
But, you know, that little boy

40:41.040 --> 40:46.797
who didn't know who his
father was, who just loved him,

40:48.320 --> 40:50.311
he saw him die,

40:51.280 --> 40:53.271
fall to the ground,

40:54.920 --> 40:57.309
right in front of him.

40:58.960 --> 41:03.238
That little boy all covered
in his daddy's blood...

41:05.440 --> 41:07.874
was just changed forever.

41:10.280 --> 41:16.276
<i>It's neverjust the one person
who dies, Bones. Never... never.</i>

41:27.560 --> 41:31.439
You know, we all die
a little bit, Bones.

41:31.520 --> 41:34.557
With each shot, we all die a little bit.

42:06.800 --> 42:11.078
