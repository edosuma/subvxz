Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

00:21.238 --> 00:23.197
Hey, you know what
I was thinking?

00:23.240 --> 00:25.895
No.What about going to Vegas?

00:30.639 --> 00:32.467
There's a difference. Yeah, okay.

00:32.509 --> 00:34.338
Well, then camping, then.

00:34.382 --> 00:36.166
Ooh, someplace gorgeous.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.386
We could go hiking.

00:41.563 --> 00:44.609
You and me and a mountain.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.918
We could dip into our savings

00:48.961 --> 00:51.312
and hike the...

00:51.355 --> 00:53.662
Damn it. Not again.

00:54.706 --> 00:56.491
Well, there goes my bread.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.928
Country living, sweetheart.
Hydro's for wimps.

00:58.971 --> 01:01.017
Will you please call? For you,

01:01.061 --> 01:03.280
anything.

01:03.324 --> 01:05.239
What the hell was that?

01:05.282 --> 01:06.588
The recycling?

01:06.631 --> 01:09.504
On its own?

01:20.036 --> 01:21.124
My God!

01:21.168 --> 01:23.213
Drop it!

01:23.257 --> 01:24.301
Do what he said.

01:24.345 --> 01:25.955
Get the hell out of our house.

01:25.998 --> 01:27.261
Rose...

01:29.611 --> 01:30.960
I said drop it!

01:31.003 --> 01:33.267
Five, four...

01:33.310 --> 01:34.311
Wait, Rose...

01:34.355 --> 01:36.444
Three, two...

01:36.487 --> 01:38.446
Rosie, drop it, please.

01:38.489 --> 01:39.925
One.

01:42.363 --> 01:44.495
Please...

01:44.539 --> 01:45.975
If you hurt her...

01:46.018 --> 01:47.933
Please, just take
whatever you want.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.587
I'm gonna kill you.

01:49.631 --> 01:51.111
Bank opens in two hours.

01:51.154 --> 01:53.156
We need $250,000.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.984
We don't get it, she dies.

01:55.027 --> 01:58.466
You call the police, she dies.
You see the pattern?

02:00.032 --> 02:02.557
Take your car.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.037
Get going! Rose, I got this.

02:14.090 --> 02:16.701
It's going to be okay.
You'll see.

02:40.943 --> 02:43.075
Lovely.

02:43.119 --> 02:44.555
Lovely spot
for a hostage-taking.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.688
Sight lines are broken up.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.733
Tactical team could
get into the house

02:48.777 --> 02:50.146
before the hostage-takers
had a clue.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.650
We're dealing with amateurs.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.609
Yeah, rifle and a crossbow
aren't weapons

02:54.652 --> 02:56.480
typically favored
by professionals.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.221
And we passed nicer
spots along the way.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.919
Even if you're an amateur,
why choose a small farm?

03:00.963 --> 03:02.834
Doesn't exactly scream money.

03:02.878 --> 03:05.228
And why only ask for $250,000?

03:05.272 --> 03:07.535
Yeah, good question.
Did you bring any coffee?

03:07.578 --> 03:10.538
No, I got tea...

03:10.581 --> 03:13.497
She doesn't know yet. I know.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.895
Simone Merriweather?

03:19.938 --> 03:21.244
Yeah. Eric Beaumont.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.854
Yeah. I went to get the money,

03:22.898 --> 03:25.248
and Rose changed her PIN code.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.032
I can't get anything without it.

03:27.076 --> 03:28.401
Are there sufficient funds
in the account?

03:28.425 --> 03:29.383
More than enough.

03:29.426 --> 03:30.862
But I can't get it.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.735
That man said that if I
didn't pay, he would...

03:33.778 --> 03:35.103
Okay, listen, it's good
that you called us.

03:35.127 --> 03:36.583
We've handled hundreds
of these situations.

03:36.607 --> 03:38.261
I'll get them
to let me talk to Rose.

03:38.305 --> 03:39.393
That won't work.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.264
No, Rose can give Eric
the PIN number.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.266
You don't know Rose.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.225
She won't pay.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.357
They'll have to kill her first.

04:17.648 --> 04:19.694
Simone, why don't we
go someplace quiet?

04:19.737 --> 04:21.130
I brought some tea.

04:21.173 --> 04:22.523
No, I-I can't leave her.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.089
Yeah, but you can't
help her from here.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.787
And you can help us.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.354
We have questions.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.747
Can we go somewhere and talk?

04:31.009 --> 04:32.620
Yeah, um, okay.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.404
We, we can go this way.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.320
We need to ask you some...

04:37.364 --> 04:39.191
Be right there. Okay.
We need to ask you

04:39.235 --> 04:40.628
some questions about Rose.

04:43.848 --> 04:46.373
And we are live.

04:46.416 --> 04:49.376
So, what's the strategy?

04:49.419 --> 04:50.638
Same as Wellington.

04:50.681 --> 04:51.639
Wellington?

04:51.682 --> 04:52.901
Like the duke?

04:52.944 --> 04:54.772
Before the Battle of Waterloo,

04:54.816 --> 04:56.097
he was asked
what his strategy was

04:56.121 --> 04:57.427
to defeat Napoleon.

04:57.471 --> 04:58.776
Yeah? And what'd he say?

04:58.820 --> 05:00.387
Beat the French.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.476
Winning. Right.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.434
Always a good strategy.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.397
Not a step closer.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.616
Labile, stressed.
He's definitely under pressure.

05:12.660 --> 05:15.402
My name is Eric Beaumont.
I'm not with the police.

05:15.445 --> 05:17.926
I'm a private negotiator
here to get you what you need.

05:17.969 --> 05:20.363
I need $250,000.

05:20.407 --> 05:21.364
So we've been told.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.583
Let me talk to Rose Klein,

05:22.626 --> 05:23.821
the woman you're
holding hostage,

05:23.845 --> 05:24.885
then we'll get your money.

05:29.241 --> 05:30.808
It's either an invitation

05:30.852 --> 05:32.375
or a trap.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.334
What would Wellington do?

05:36.031 --> 05:37.685
So you moved to the country.

05:37.728 --> 05:40.340
Five years ago.
It was her dream.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.254
I'm still not crazy
about it, to be honest,

05:42.298 --> 05:44.561
but... she loves it out here.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.563
You know, I should get back.

05:46.607 --> 05:49.131
You hired us
for a reason, right?

05:49.174 --> 05:51.786
Our colleagues are helping
Rose over there.

05:51.829 --> 05:54.179
We need you to help her here.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.399
Come on.

05:56.443 --> 05:57.835
Okay.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.315
Do you have any idea

05:59.359 --> 06:01.491
why these people
might have targeted you?

06:01.535 --> 06:02.971
We were worried

06:03.014 --> 06:04.451
when we came out here.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.453
You know, being a gay couple,
small town.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.933
But it's been fine.

06:08.977 --> 06:11.849
You said the intruders
spoke with foreign accents.

06:11.893 --> 06:14.199
Rose is always saying
that illegals are criminals,

06:14.243 --> 06:17.115
you know, wing-nut stuff that
she reads on the Internet,

06:17.159 --> 06:18.856
and now this happens.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.467
How do you know
they were undocumented?

06:20.510 --> 06:22.469
A lot of them work
on farms around here.

06:22.512 --> 06:24.471
Including yours? No.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.386
Rose is too stubborn.

06:26.429 --> 06:27.952
It's always hard to find workers

06:27.996 --> 06:29.867
come harvest time, but, she just

06:29.911 --> 06:31.869
grinds herself into the ground

06:31.913 --> 06:33.131
doing it all herself.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.181
Don't try anything.

06:44.099 --> 06:45.970
Faces aren't
in any criminal database, Eric.

06:46.014 --> 06:49.844
Running a waveform
on our rifleman's accent now.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.802
I'm not armed.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.021
You can frisk me.

06:53.064 --> 06:54.196
Where is the money?

06:54.239 --> 06:56.677
It appears he's from Syria.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.940
Simone is working on it.

06:58.983 --> 07:00.898
You can understand
getting $250,000 together

07:00.942 --> 07:02.987
on short notice isn't easy.

07:03.031 --> 07:04.467
We get the money...

07:04.511 --> 07:06.600
or she's dead by tonight.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.906
Dude with the crossbow's
from someplace else.

07:08.950 --> 07:09.951
Checking now.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.213
250 is a lot of cash.

07:11.256 --> 07:12.475
What do you need it for?

07:12.519 --> 07:13.868
Not your problem.

07:13.911 --> 07:16.392
You need to talk to her
to get our money,

07:16.436 --> 07:18.350
then talk.

07:18.394 --> 07:19.700
No dice on the accent search

07:19.743 --> 07:21.528
on Crossbow.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.573
Hey, my name's Eric.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.749
Fleeting eye contact.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.838
Our hostage-takers don't
know each other well.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.884
You talk to your client,
not them.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.668
Sure.

07:31.712 --> 07:33.235
Rose, I'm a negotiator.
Are you okay?

07:34.932 --> 07:36.238
Can-can we lose the gag?

07:36.281 --> 07:37.282
Can we take it off?

07:39.241 --> 07:41.243
Definitely this dude's show.

07:41.286 --> 07:43.245
Others are just along
for the ride.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.250
You pathetic bastards.Okay.

07:48.293 --> 07:49.445
I should talk
to Ms. Klein alone.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.774
Not a chance.

07:50.818 --> 07:53.342
Just, just literally a minute
in private.

07:53.385 --> 07:54.996
That one's named Nabil.

07:55.039 --> 07:58.826
And she's, what is it,
Lilac or Laylee or something.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.262
They're illegals.

08:00.305 --> 08:03.091
Keep whispering words
like "escape"

08:03.134 --> 08:04.745
and "deported."

08:04.788 --> 08:06.573
Well, if they're undocumented,

08:06.616 --> 08:08.923
that explains why their faces
aren't in the database.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.664
I said not to talk
in front of her.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.187
Is that true, Nabil?

08:12.230 --> 08:13.667
You're all here without papers?

08:13.710 --> 08:16.191
Talk, now, before I shoot you!

08:16.234 --> 08:17.932
You want to give us
the money or not?

08:17.975 --> 08:19.455
I want to give you
what you need,

08:19.499 --> 08:22.110
and then I want everyone
to walk out of here unhurt.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.566
And it seems to me like
your friend over there

08:23.590 --> 08:25.505
is in need of medical attention.

08:27.289 --> 08:28.943
Okay,

08:28.986 --> 08:30.814
I give you one minute.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.054
Nabil, I don't think
it's a good idea...

08:34.078 --> 08:35.645
Go.

08:41.433 --> 08:42.739
Don't get any ideas, now.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.570
All right,

08:47.614 --> 08:49.877
Rose, we need the PIN code
to your bank account.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.227
Not happening. I told Simone.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.403
I'll negotiate down
as low as I can,

08:54.446 --> 08:56.840
but we need to offer something.

08:56.884 --> 09:00.148
An animal gets aggressive,
you stand firm

09:00.191 --> 09:01.845
or you get hurt.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.412
These are desperate people.

09:03.455 --> 09:05.588
I can't predict right now
what they might do.

09:05.632 --> 09:09.157
I poured my blood
and sweat into this place.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.638
I'm not gonna give all my money
to a bunch of thieves.

09:11.681 --> 09:14.205
Whatever that money means
to you, your life means more.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.337
You're not hearing me.

09:15.380 --> 09:19.036
I said hell no.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.343
Well?

09:21.386 --> 09:23.539
Well, I'm working to get you
a significant amount of money,

09:23.563 --> 09:26.348
but I can't get you $250,000.

09:26.391 --> 09:29.917
You see? He's a liar.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.310
It has to be $250,000.

09:34.225 --> 09:36.184
Hey.

09:36.227 --> 09:38.273
Cynthia's still with Simone.

09:38.316 --> 09:40.057
I thought you should know,

09:40.101 --> 09:41.668
Rose has a big problem
with anyone

09:41.711 --> 09:43.278
who crosses the border
illegally.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.193
It could get pretty
volatile up there.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.543
Yeah, so we noticed.
Simone was right.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.066
Rose won't give us the PIN code.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.067
I've heard
of principled positions,

09:50.111 --> 09:51.939
but risking your own life?

09:51.982 --> 09:53.351
Yeah, I think there's
more to it than that.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.657
I don't know, her attitude
was way over the top.

09:54.681 --> 09:55.701
It's like she's trying too hard.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.553
Well, could be hiding something.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.687
Yeah. Why don't you
meet up with Cynthia?

10:00.730 --> 10:02.036
Where are we going?

10:02.079 --> 10:03.690
Take Simone back to the bank.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.082
Find out what her options are.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.431
Maybe a mortgage.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.129
What do you want me to do?

10:08.172 --> 10:09.260
We have a medi-kit?

10:09.304 --> 10:11.088
In the trunk.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.110
One of the women in there
looks like she's been shot.

10:13.134 --> 10:15.049
I want to find out why.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.441
Okay.

10:23.448 --> 10:24.885
I'm sorry, Mr...?

10:24.928 --> 10:26.930
Yates. Oliver.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.715
As I already told Simone,

10:28.758 --> 10:31.326
I can't give her access
to Mrs. Klein's account.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.415
No, no, no, she doesn't
want access to her account,

10:33.458 --> 10:35.591
Mr. Merker, she
just wants a loan

10:35.635 --> 10:36.786
against the property they own.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.899
Is everything all right, Simone?

10:40.291 --> 10:42.337
Actually, do you mind?

10:42.380 --> 10:43.730
She and Rose had a fight.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.732
That's why Simone
has asked us here.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.908
We're old college buddies
from Winnipeg.

10:47.951 --> 10:50.127
Go, Wesmen.

10:50.171 --> 10:52.782
Rose has cut
her off without a dime,

10:52.826 --> 10:55.437
and now they may be
looking at a divorce.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.091
I'm sorry to hear that,
Simone, truly,

10:57.134 --> 10:59.789
but another loan I-is...

10:59.833 --> 11:01.486
There's no question... Wait, wait.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.227
Anotherloan?

11:03.271 --> 11:04.727
Well, you and Rose,
you took out a second mortgage

11:04.751 --> 11:06.448
only six months ago.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.493
I don't know anything
about a second mortgage.

11:08.537 --> 11:11.540
Your signature's
on the application.

11:11.583 --> 11:12.933
What?

11:12.976 --> 11:15.152
How much is it for?

11:15.196 --> 11:16.521
They still have a balance
on their first,

11:16.545 --> 11:18.242
but we were able
to write it for $150,000.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.462
Wait, you're telling me
that Rose

11:20.505 --> 11:22.899
took out another $150,000
against the house?

11:22.943 --> 11:24.466
That doesn't make any sense.

11:24.509 --> 11:27.164
We have savings.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.600
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Merriweather, but,

11:28.644 --> 11:30.907
both of your accounts
are overdrawn.

11:30.951 --> 11:33.518
I'm sorry.

11:41.222 --> 11:42.963
You have the money?

11:43.006 --> 11:44.288
Your friend needs
medical attention.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.792
We brought first aid.

11:45.835 --> 11:47.054
She's fine.

11:47.097 --> 11:48.490
No, she's not.

11:48.533 --> 11:51.058
Let them in.

12:07.683 --> 12:08.858
May I?

12:16.344 --> 12:19.695
This looks like a gunshot wound.

12:19.739 --> 12:23.046
I don't suppose you want
to tell me how it happened.

12:25.266 --> 12:28.312
My name's Zara.

12:28.356 --> 12:29.879
What's yours?

12:29.923 --> 12:32.316
Miral.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.362
It's gonna sting a little bit.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.366
Where are you from?

12:38.409 --> 12:40.237
I was born in the U.S.,

12:40.281 --> 12:42.762
but my parents are from India.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.373
You? I'm from Egypt.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.549
But you didn't come
alone, did you?

12:47.592 --> 12:50.378
Who have you been talking to?

12:50.421 --> 12:52.381
Well, someone shot at her
and sent the four of you

12:52.423 --> 12:55.252
to this farmhouse looking
for a quarter million dollars.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.819
No one sent us.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.492
Tell him the truth, Nabil. TIMBO:
Shut up.

12:58.516 --> 13:00.059
Each of you is from
a different country.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.129
You wouldn't have come
to Canada together.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.572
Someone brought you
over the border.

13:03.608 --> 13:06.307
See, he already knows.

13:06.350 --> 13:07.874
I said shut your mouth. Okay, listen.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.614
I haven't called the police,

13:09.658 --> 13:11.225
the border patrol.

13:11.268 --> 13:13.228
There's no SWAT team on its way.
You can trust me.

13:13.270 --> 13:16.708
Smugglers, human smugglers.

13:16.752 --> 13:19.450
They're holding my daughter Aya.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.019
She's only 14.

13:23.063 --> 13:25.500
So you need the money
to save your daughter.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.763
He'll kill her.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.678
He'll kill them all.

13:31.201 --> 13:32.812
"All"?

13:39.644 --> 13:42.169
Lift her up. We need air.

14:02.319 --> 14:04.495
All right, you need
to tell me who you really are.

14:04.539 --> 14:05.845
Miral's Egyptian.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.063
She was in Tahrir Square

14:07.107 --> 14:08.978
during the Arab Spring,

14:09.022 --> 14:11.067
ended up on a
government blacklist.

14:11.111 --> 14:13.113
Timbo's Hungarian Roma,

14:13.156 --> 14:15.593
Gypsy. His house

14:15.637 --> 14:17.421
was burnt down by neo-Nazis.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.597
Leila's from Iran.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.773
She was on an arrest
list for protesting.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.340
And I'm from Syria.

14:23.384 --> 14:25.865
I was part of the uprising
against Assad.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.998
We came to America
because we had no choice.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.696
But the way things
are there now,

14:31.740 --> 14:33.698
they want to send us back
to our deaths.

14:33.742 --> 14:36.092
So you ran to Canada instead?

14:36.136 --> 14:38.790
Where did the four of you meet?

14:38.834 --> 14:42.707
In a field outside Syracuse
three days ago.

14:42.751 --> 14:43.883
On Carson's truck.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.885
Carson?

14:45.928 --> 14:48.278
- The smuggler.
- Carson Dent.

14:48.322 --> 14:51.107
At least, that's what
they say his name is.

14:51.151 --> 14:52.804
We didn't know each other.

14:52.848 --> 14:56.069
We didn't speak, hardly at all,
until yesterday.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.679
What happened yesterday?

14:59.942 --> 15:02.075
We'd paid to get
across the border,

15:02.118 --> 15:04.338
but Carson's men
wouldn't let us out.

15:04.381 --> 15:05.730
Okay.

15:05.774 --> 15:06.731
Welcome to Canada.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.168
They said we had

15:08.211 --> 15:09.909
to pay more
because of security risks.

15:09.952 --> 15:12.041
We were told to call
our families,

15:12.085 --> 15:14.304
to have them wire the money...
pay us more money.

15:16.306 --> 15:19.440
The four of us
and some of the others...

15:21.442 --> 15:23.400
our families sent the money.

15:23.444 --> 15:25.098
We were being set free.

15:25.141 --> 15:29.450
But then Carson
came back, angry.

15:29.493 --> 15:31.321
He said $250,000
had gone missing.

15:31.365 --> 15:32.714
Hey...

15:32.757 --> 15:34.498
Someone stole prepaid
credit cards,

15:34.542 --> 15:36.283
and it had to be one of us
who stole them.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.981
He said if we didn't show them
where they are,

15:39.025 --> 15:40.983
he was going to lock us inside

15:41.027 --> 15:43.943
with no food or water
until we gave him the cards.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.729
One of the men got scared,

15:47.772 --> 15:49.426
tried to run,

15:49.470 --> 15:50.688
they shot him.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.995
Shut up, speak English.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.039
Okay.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.782
Hey. Okay, we have to go,
we have to go.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.567
They shot at us.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.308
Get her. Hey!

16:01.351 --> 16:02.570
This way, this way.

16:02.613 --> 16:04.050
Come here, come here.

16:04.093 --> 16:05.790
They caught Miral's daughter.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.444
My cards?

16:10.926 --> 16:13.233
And they killed my wife.

16:17.454 --> 16:19.848
Only we escaped.

16:21.806 --> 16:22.938
I am so sorry for your loss.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.682
Why did you come here?

16:27.725 --> 16:29.510
I'd heard Carson's men

16:29.553 --> 16:33.079
talking about property
on this side of the border.

16:33.122 --> 16:36.952
Owners who are
"sitting on gold."

16:36.996 --> 16:39.781
They talked about Rose,
so I knew she had money.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.826
There's an empty house

16:41.870 --> 16:44.394
down the road... we found
the weapons and the rope there.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.701
We didn't steal Carson's money.

16:46.744 --> 16:48.311
But now you see
why we need hers.

16:48.355 --> 16:51.967
Well, I don't know
what her land is worth,

16:52.011 --> 16:54.171
but owning property doesn't mean
having cash available.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.668
Can you tell us
where the container is?

16:57.712 --> 17:00.149
Please save my daughter.

17:05.241 --> 17:07.026
Eric?

17:07.069 --> 17:08.375
How did it go at the bank?

17:08.417 --> 17:09.656
The PIN code
would have been useless.

17:09.680 --> 17:10.701
Rose forged Simone's signature

17:10.724 --> 17:12.683
to get a second mortgage.

17:12.727 --> 17:15.338
She's got nowhere near
250 grand.

17:15.382 --> 17:17.339
We enter into a second
negotiation.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.167
The hostage takers
only wanted the money

17:19.212 --> 17:21.300
so they could pay
a ransom of their own.

17:21.344 --> 17:22.911
And what ransom is that?

17:22.954 --> 17:25.063
To spare the lives of 18
refugees locked in a container

17:25.087 --> 17:26.406
without food, water,
or fresh air.

17:26.435 --> 17:28.873
My goodness. Where are they now?

17:28.917 --> 17:30.484
I'll send the location now.

17:30.527 --> 17:32.312
But be careful.

17:32.355 --> 17:33.530
The smugglers are armed.

17:33.574 --> 17:34.531
Yeah.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.055
Noted.

17:40.929 --> 17:43.932
Okay, you can,
you can free her now.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.455
Not until she
gives us the money.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.023
She doesn't have it.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.026
You lying bastard.
You said she did.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.550
- I said I would
help you, and I will. - How?

17:53.594 --> 17:55.987
Without the money, Miral's
daughter will be killed.

17:56.031 --> 17:57.467
We will find a way.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.775
May I?

18:18.314 --> 18:20.403
This is the spot.

18:20.447 --> 18:22.033
Yeah, there was definitely
something big was here.

18:22.057 --> 18:23.617
Yeah. There's some
freshly turned earth.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.235
There.

18:27.976 --> 18:30.196
Tossed like garbage.

18:30.239 --> 18:32.459
After this many years
in politics, you'd think

18:32.502 --> 18:34.809
humanity wouldn't be able
to disappoint me anymore.

18:34.852 --> 18:35.984
Yeah.

18:36.027 --> 18:38.508
Passports?

18:39.640 --> 18:41.729
Hey.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.731
She was at the house.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.602
"Leila Behbahani."

18:45.646 --> 18:47.038
And what's that?

18:47.082 --> 18:50.607
I... it's Greek.

18:50.651 --> 18:52.218
You read Greek?

18:52.261 --> 18:55.612
No, but I recognize it.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.353
There's an awful lot
of numbers on here.

18:57.397 --> 19:00.313
It's some kind of receipt
or something.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.315
Okay.

19:05.318 --> 19:10.801
I know what you're thinking,
but it's going to be okay.

19:10.845 --> 19:13.848
If it's not,
and if he finds out...

19:16.285 --> 19:17.982
They invaded your home,

19:18.026 --> 19:19.810
threatened your life
and tied you up.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.421
I mean, you should be mad.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.292
Yeah, exactly. So why do you sound

19:23.336 --> 19:25.555
defensive, Rose?

19:25.599 --> 19:27.992
It wasn't just principle

19:28.036 --> 19:30.778
that kept you from paying
that ransom.

19:30.821 --> 19:33.781
You didn't have the money.

19:33.824 --> 19:34.999
What makes you think that?

19:35.043 --> 19:37.915
Well, we know about
the second mortgage.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.482
So we know that

19:39.526 --> 19:41.136
you were desperate, financially.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.008
And we have an idea
of what your land is worth.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.750
And why does that matter?

19:46.794 --> 19:50.276
Leila heard Carson's men say
you were sitting on gold.

19:50.319 --> 19:54.018
And since the value of your
property is pretty modest,

19:54.062 --> 19:58.849
I can only assume that they were
talking about its value to them.

19:58.893 --> 20:01.025
So remote, right on the border.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.462
You're not in danger anymore,

20:02.505 --> 20:05.029
but a lot of other people are.

20:05.073 --> 20:07.684
Time to come clean.

20:09.164 --> 20:10.687
Carson asked to use the back end

20:10.731 --> 20:12.994
of the property
as a transfer point.

20:13.037 --> 20:15.953
He offered us enough
money to keep us going.

20:15.997 --> 20:21.045
But I swear, I didn't know how
he was treating those people.

20:21.089 --> 20:24.005
You didn't know
or you didn't care?

20:25.876 --> 20:27.138
How do I find Carson?

20:27.182 --> 20:28.314
I've never seen his face.

20:28.357 --> 20:29.706
He just calls me.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.578
Well, I need a location.

20:34.233 --> 20:38.149
He owns the old salvage lot,
just south of 556.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.876
What's up, guys?

21:10.878 --> 21:12.967
I'm looking for Carson Dent.

21:16.362 --> 21:17.319
Leave your name, your number.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.601
He'll call you when he has time.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.583
My name is Eric Beaumont.

21:20.627 --> 21:21.976
My number is
1-800-human-smuggler.

21:24.805 --> 21:27.111
I'll wait.

21:32.465 --> 21:34.162
Follow me.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.557
Yeah. I'll call you back.

21:45.478 --> 21:46.653
So...

21:46.696 --> 21:48.089
you are?

21:48.132 --> 21:49.743
I'm a negotiator.

21:49.786 --> 21:51.222
Is that supposed
to mean something?

21:51.266 --> 21:53.399
You've locked some people
in a shipping container

21:53.442 --> 21:55.575
because you say
that they stole your money.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.011
I want to make a deal.

21:58.665 --> 22:01.755
You let them go,
I don't report you to the RCMP.

22:01.798 --> 22:05.367
I have no clue
what you're talking about

22:05.411 --> 22:08.675
and even if I did, the RCMP...

22:08.718 --> 22:11.155
they'd never
find that container.

22:11.199 --> 22:13.854
Your body language suggests
you feel threatened.

22:13.897 --> 22:17.945
I'm not here to threaten you.

22:17.988 --> 22:19.468
I took a position
in a negotiation.

22:19.512 --> 22:21.165
Now you're free to counter,

22:21.209 --> 22:22.665
and I'll take it back
to the people I represent.

22:22.689 --> 22:24.212
Represent? Who?

22:24.255 --> 22:25.953
Some people
you did business with.

22:25.996 --> 22:27.476
Describe them.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.193
Two men, two women.
They're from out of town.

22:29.217 --> 22:30.392
Where are they?

22:33.047 --> 22:35.658
I'll tell you what.

22:35.702 --> 22:38.226
Why don't you bring 'em in,

22:38.269 --> 22:39.706
we can do this in person.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.751
Yeah, you know,
that's not gonna be possible.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.231
You sure you're
not threatening me?

22:43.274 --> 22:46.277
'Cause I'm picking up
some real attitude here.

22:52.545 --> 22:54.851
I'll tell you what.

22:54.895 --> 22:56.679
You go back to your people

22:56.723 --> 22:59.043
and you tell them if they bring
back what they took from me

22:59.073 --> 23:03.382
in the next hour,
everything will be forgiven.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.471
Well, they say
they didn't take it.

23:05.514 --> 23:08.256
Well, in that case,
we have nothing to talk about,

23:08.299 --> 23:11.955
and I'm a busy man,
so if you don't mind...

23:13.566 --> 23:17.047
I'll see you around.

23:17.091 --> 23:19.876
Hot today?

23:19.920 --> 23:21.487
Wouldn't want to
be without water.

23:23.576 --> 23:26.013
Not liable to live very long.

23:30.844 --> 23:34.761
Tell me you found them.

23:34.804 --> 23:36.023
Wish I could.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.198
The container was gone.

23:37.241 --> 23:38.199
We found a lot
of personal belongings

23:38.242 --> 23:39.722
that were thrown away.

23:39.766 --> 23:41.768
Including passports,
one of which was Leila's.

23:41.811 --> 23:43.030
I e-mailed you a picture

23:43.073 --> 23:44.466
from a paper we found inside it.

23:44.510 --> 23:47.164
Yeah, got it.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.528
Sorry, guys.
It's all Greek to me.

23:48.557 --> 23:50.080
Yeah, well, it looks like

23:50.124 --> 23:52.126
it's some kind of bank receipt
from Cyprus,

23:52.169 --> 23:55.216
sent to a copy shop in town
yesterday afternoon.

23:55.259 --> 23:56.739
Anything on our smuggler?

23:56.783 --> 23:59.525
Carson Dent served five
years for human trafficking.

23:59.568 --> 24:00.874
That was ten years ago.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.571
He was connected
to a larger syndicate

24:02.615 --> 24:04.225
run out of the Southern U.S.

24:04.268 --> 24:06.053
Been flying
under the radar ever since.

24:06.096 --> 24:08.335
He said the RCMP would never
find that shipping container.

24:08.359 --> 24:09.709
We're running out of time.

24:09.752 --> 24:11.101
I need leverage.

24:11.145 --> 24:12.755
Aye, aye. We'll dig deeper.

24:12.799 --> 24:15.541
I'm gonna pick up Simone.
Take her home.

24:15.584 --> 24:18.544
You know, a man like Carson
has to be moving a lot of funds.

24:18.587 --> 24:21.068
What are we talking about...
Prepaid credit cards?

24:21.111 --> 24:22.504
Exactly.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.593
Take another run
at the bank manager.

24:24.637 --> 24:27.944
Okay. Do it and do it quickly.

24:39.042 --> 24:40.653
Hang on a sec.

24:40.696 --> 24:44.918
Before you see Rose,

24:44.961 --> 24:46.833
there's something
you deserve to know.

24:46.876 --> 24:50.271
She's been taking payoffs
from a man named Carson Dent.

24:50.314 --> 24:53.100
Used your property
as a transfer point

24:53.143 --> 24:54.710
smuggling people
across the border.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.453
I'm sorry, Simone.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.715
It came from Rose herself.

25:00.934 --> 25:03.153
She confessed.

25:11.727 --> 25:14.600
Hey.

25:14.643 --> 25:16.906
What's wrong?

25:16.950 --> 25:19.735
I thought you'd at least
be happy to see me.

25:19.779 --> 25:22.956
I'm glad you're safe.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.566
But?

25:24.610 --> 25:26.916
You lied to me. I'm sorry.

25:26.960 --> 25:30.398
I should have told you
about the mortgage.

25:30.441 --> 25:31.704
Leila, you recognize this?

25:31.747 --> 25:34.097
I dropped it when I ran.

25:34.141 --> 25:35.621
It's a bank receipt.

25:35.664 --> 25:37.753
That's what I thought.

25:37.797 --> 25:40.669
It shows $10,000
being sent to Iran

25:40.713 --> 25:43.237
through a bank in Cyprus.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.431
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

25:44.455 --> 25:46.980
They told you everything.

25:47.023 --> 25:49.243
Guess they're more honest
than you are,

25:49.286 --> 25:51.811
not that it's a high bar.

25:51.854 --> 25:53.334
I'm sorry.

25:53.377 --> 25:56.424
I used to shake my head
at your politics.

25:56.467 --> 25:57.991
But you've been taking money

25:58.034 --> 26:01.864
from a man who traffics
in human beings.

26:01.908 --> 26:03.170
It-it was a mistake.

26:03.213 --> 26:04.519
A big one.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.914
And I swear to you,
I know that now.

26:07.957 --> 26:10.830
So, yesterday everyone's
calling their families,

26:10.873 --> 26:12.658
asking for cash to pay Carson,

26:12.701 --> 26:14.573
and yet you somehow
had the money

26:14.616 --> 26:17.880
to wire $10,000 to your family.

26:17.924 --> 26:21.275
Look, I'm not threatening you
or placing blame.

26:21.318 --> 26:23.190
I just need to know the truth.

26:23.233 --> 26:27.716
You took those credit cards,
didn't you?

26:27.760 --> 26:31.024
I never let myself think
about the specifics before,

26:31.067 --> 26:34.897
but... come on, baby.

26:34.941 --> 26:37.073
Baby, the farm...
It was bleeding money.

26:37.117 --> 26:40.076
I wanted, I wanted this
to work so badly, I...

26:40.120 --> 26:41.904
Please, Simone.

26:41.948 --> 26:44.124
When we got here,

26:44.167 --> 26:47.910
Carson's men were partying.
Drunk.

26:47.954 --> 26:50.565
They brought some of the women
out of the container.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.698
One wanted to impress me.

26:52.741 --> 26:57.006
He told me how they use the
cards to move their money

26:57.050 --> 26:59.095
and where they hid them.

26:59.139 --> 27:01.663
He passed out. Thank God.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.665
And you took the cards?

27:03.709 --> 27:05.121
Once this is over,
I'm going back to Toronto.

27:05.145 --> 27:06.755
No, you can't.

27:06.799 --> 27:09.932
Yeah. I can.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.937
I needed the money
to save my family.

27:14.981 --> 27:17.331
And now you got to pay back
Carson to save the others,

27:17.374 --> 27:20.073
which is why you took
Rose hostage.

27:20.116 --> 27:21.422
I didn't know what to do.

27:21.465 --> 27:22.858
Where are the cards?

27:22.902 --> 27:23.946
I hid them.

27:23.990 --> 27:25.513
Okay. Show me where.

27:25.556 --> 27:28.168
She can't do that, Mr. Beaumont.

27:28.211 --> 27:29.778
Nabil.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.451
Do you know how many lives
that money can save

27:31.475 --> 27:33.739
back home for Leila,
for my family, too?

27:33.782 --> 27:36.132
It seems to me it's about
to cost quite a few.

27:36.176 --> 27:37.699
What do you think's
going to happen

27:37.743 --> 27:39.745
if you give back the money
with $10,000 missing

27:39.788 --> 27:41.268
and tell him it was you?

27:41.311 --> 27:42.748
We can work out an arrangement.

27:42.791 --> 27:44.706
What if they're already dead?

27:44.750 --> 27:46.031
What if we confess,
give up the cards,

27:46.055 --> 27:47.535
and he gives us bodies?

27:47.578 --> 27:49.252
Well, it's just as possible
that they're still alive.

27:49.276 --> 27:50.993
And when they're safe,
we can find other ways

27:51.017 --> 27:53.106
to help both your families.

27:53.149 --> 27:56.283
Unless you can tell me
where I can find $250,000,

27:56.326 --> 28:00.069
then helping our families
is-is a fantasy.

28:00.113 --> 28:01.133
Have you ever lived in Syria,

28:01.157 --> 28:03.290
Mr. Beaumont?

28:03.333 --> 28:04.746
Have you ever gone hungry
six nights in a row

28:04.770 --> 28:07.120
so your pregnant sister can eat?

28:07.163 --> 28:09.818
Or sold your kidneys
so you can come to the States?

28:09.862 --> 28:11.777
You and your fancy suit.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.430
You don't get it.

28:13.474 --> 28:14.518
No, but I bet she does.

28:15.824 --> 28:18.087
And she wants to show me
where those cards are.

28:18.131 --> 28:20.829
No. She wants to help her father

28:20.873 --> 28:24.093
and her family.

28:24.137 --> 28:25.529
Look, you stealing those cards

28:25.573 --> 28:27.183
has already hurt
a lot of people,

28:27.227 --> 28:28.489
including Timbo's wife.

28:28.532 --> 28:30.796
I know you don't want
anyone else to die.

28:30.839 --> 28:33.973
I don't know what to do.

28:34.016 --> 28:35.931
Then do what you know
you can live with,

28:35.975 --> 28:38.325
right here, right now.

28:38.368 --> 28:40.980
Save as many lives as you can.

28:43.417 --> 28:46.159
I'll show you where they are.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.742
I like to have
a strategy in place

29:03.785 --> 29:05.134
going into this kind of thing.

29:05.178 --> 29:06.962
Good. What's our strategy?

29:07.006 --> 29:10.009
No, I said I'd like to,
as in I wish I did.

29:10.052 --> 29:13.534
Do you have a default?

29:13.577 --> 29:15.492
Direct pressure.

29:15.536 --> 29:16.755
Copy that.

29:21.672 --> 29:24.806
How can I help you
this time, Mr. Yates?

29:24.850 --> 29:27.548
Well, the last time
we were here,

29:27.591 --> 29:30.072
we weren't entirely
honest with you.

29:30.116 --> 29:34.468
You're not Simone's
college friends, are you? Afraid not.

29:34.511 --> 29:36.513
Actually, Oliver's
a psychological profiler.

29:36.557 --> 29:38.951
A profiler?

29:38.994 --> 29:41.190
There's a lot of noise about
what a profiler actually does,

29:41.214 --> 29:43.738
but amongst other things,
I read microexpressions.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.958
Put bluntly, he knows
what you're feeling.

29:46.001 --> 29:48.197
Now, when we came in the first
time, your eyes were darting,

29:48.221 --> 29:51.180
breath was short. You were
nervous about something.

29:51.224 --> 29:53.835
That's very impressive,

29:53.879 --> 29:56.446
but I think you've misread
the situation.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.448
I was having a tough morning.
That's all.

29:58.492 --> 30:00.494
- Arguing with my wife.
- Yeah, of course.

30:00.537 --> 30:02.235
You see how, he swallows

30:02.278 --> 30:03.845
and licks his lips
before he speaks?

30:03.889 --> 30:05.238
He's lying again. Lying again.

30:05.281 --> 30:07.457
I'm not lying.

30:07.501 --> 30:08.913
Well, I guess your face
didn't get the memo.

30:08.937 --> 30:10.852
See, the only thing
we could figure is you knew

30:10.896 --> 30:12.656
why Simone came and asked
for that large sum of cash.

30:12.680 --> 30:15.422
And we think that
may be because Carson Dent

30:15.465 --> 30:16.989
does big business
with your bank.

30:17.032 --> 30:19.556
He's a pretty important client,
isn't he, Mr. Merker?

30:19.600 --> 30:20.949
All those cash deposits?

30:20.993 --> 30:22.255
You wouldn't want to lose him.

30:22.298 --> 30:23.798
In fact, you might break
the rules for him.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.171
And you see
how your face changes

30:25.214 --> 30:26.433
when I say the name Carson?

30:26.476 --> 30:29.697
That's what we profilers
call a hot spot.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.699
It means he hit a raw nerve.

30:31.742 --> 30:33.962
He has 18 people
locked up in a storage container

30:34.006 --> 30:36.095
dying of heat exhaustion
as we speak.

30:36.138 --> 30:38.290
So, you either go to jail for
bank fraud, money laundering...

30:38.314 --> 30:39.446
Or murder.

30:39.489 --> 30:41.883
What's it gonna be?

30:43.667 --> 30:47.367
I know how to find
your stolen credit cards.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.673
Yeah. I'm listening.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.774
Do you trust Leila

31:03.818 --> 31:05.472
to take you to the cards?

31:05.515 --> 31:07.126
Her remorse is real.

31:07.169 --> 31:08.431
Want me to come?

31:08.475 --> 31:09.713
I think you're more useful here.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.565
Listen, I'll check in
when I've got the cards.

31:11.608 --> 31:12.827
I don't want them on me

31:12.871 --> 31:14.481
when I go to negotiate
with Carson, okay?

31:14.524 --> 31:15.656
Good idea.

31:15.699 --> 31:17.310
What will you tell the others?

31:17.353 --> 31:20.139
Nothing until we get
everyone else released.

31:20.182 --> 31:21.531
Lock and load, boys.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.838
Yeah, head around back.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.337
That's Carson.
He's here for his money.

31:25.361 --> 31:26.319
Everybody get down. Down, down.

31:26.362 --> 31:27.320
Down. Don't provoke him.

31:27.363 --> 31:28.582
I'm here for my property.

31:28.625 --> 31:30.149
Send Leila out.

31:31.454 --> 31:32.542
Leila,

31:32.586 --> 31:35.589
you took the credit cards?

31:35.632 --> 31:36.653
You would have let her die.

31:36.677 --> 31:38.070
He knows exactly

31:38.113 --> 31:40.420
who he's looking for.
That was not a guess.

31:40.463 --> 31:43.510
He also knew exactly
where to come.

31:43.553 --> 31:44.990
You overheard us.

31:45.033 --> 31:46.532
You didn't think I'd let
all those people die

31:46.556 --> 31:48.558
just because of her, did you?

31:48.602 --> 31:50.909
Big man, giving orders.

31:50.952 --> 31:54.173
He knew and didn't say a word.

31:54.216 --> 31:56.523
Got one minute.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.568
When I get what's mine,

31:58.612 --> 32:01.049
I'll let your friends go,
nobody dies.

32:01.093 --> 32:03.530
You're sorry? Prove it.

32:03.573 --> 32:05.097
- Go.
- No, no, no.

32:05.140 --> 32:06.813
That's not a good idea.
Look, I can negotiate with him,

32:06.837 --> 32:08.883
get him to let me go for
the cards. All these guys,

32:08.927 --> 32:10.208
all these guns.
He's taking a big risk.

32:10.232 --> 32:12.539
I can use that.
I need you to stay

32:12.582 --> 32:13.646
where you are, okay, Leila?

32:13.670 --> 32:14.758
We're sending her out.

32:14.802 --> 32:16.543
Timbo. I had a deal.

32:16.586 --> 32:17.587
You trust him?

32:17.631 --> 32:19.372
He just wants his money.

32:19.415 --> 32:20.939
He killed your wife. Thanks to her.

32:20.982 --> 32:23.550
Nabil, I have to do this.

32:23.593 --> 32:25.726
No, no, no, you do not. CARSON:
You got 30 seconds.

32:25.769 --> 32:28.598
If we come in, it's guns firing.

32:37.346 --> 32:39.392
Well...

32:39.435 --> 32:41.002
You're not the Leila I remember.

32:41.046 --> 32:44.005
No, but I can get you
what you want.

32:44.049 --> 32:46.051
No one is gonna take
you to those cards.

32:46.094 --> 32:47.966
But if you and your men retreat,

32:48.009 --> 32:49.837
I will get her
to take me to them,

32:49.880 --> 32:51.491
and then I will
bring them to you,

32:51.534 --> 32:54.276
once everyone is released.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.148
And why would I do it your way?

32:56.191 --> 32:58.498
Because your way
involves mass murder.

32:58.541 --> 33:01.370
Nobody gets away with that.

33:01.414 --> 33:02.913
Especially not a guy
making stupid decisions.

33:02.937 --> 33:05.722
Stupid? Now you're just trying
to piss me off.

33:05.766 --> 33:08.551
No, I'm just trying to offer you
a little free advice.

33:08.595 --> 33:10.553
You think this won't
attract attention?

33:10.597 --> 33:12.164
I'm guessing you need
that money fast.

33:12.207 --> 33:15.906
I can get it for you, on my own,
without making a scene.

33:17.821 --> 33:20.128
We don't need his permission.

33:20.172 --> 33:22.087
What are you going to do?
Shoot her?

33:22.130 --> 33:24.654
I'll show you where they are.

33:24.698 --> 33:28.223
Leila, whatever
you think you owe,

33:28.267 --> 33:30.399
you don't deserve this.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.882
Get on the truck.

33:34.925 --> 33:36.971
Okay, you don't need her.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.755
I'm coming with you.

33:40.844 --> 33:42.846
You're keeping your end
of the bargain.

33:48.678 --> 33:50.767
You follow us,
I'll kill them both.

33:50.811 --> 33:53.118
Call the cops,
they all get deported,

33:53.161 --> 33:54.510
which is worse,

33:54.554 --> 33:56.512
so I'm told.

33:58.036 --> 34:01.256
He's not gonna give up
the other refugees.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.084
We failed.

34:03.128 --> 34:05.130
He's going to get his money,

34:05.173 --> 34:06.957
and then they're
all going to die.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.065
Is it over?

34:27.108 --> 34:28.849
Well, he's gone,
but it's not over.

34:28.891 --> 34:30.197
We need your help.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.940
Tell us you've got
something on Carson.

34:33.984 --> 34:35.681
Ask and you shall receive.

34:35.725 --> 34:37.335
Carson has been laundering money

34:37.379 --> 34:38.554
through the salvage yard

34:38.598 --> 34:40.121
and placing it
into offshore accounts

34:40.165 --> 34:41.949
with the help of his
friendly bank manager.

34:41.992 --> 34:44.038
He works with
a smuggling ring down south...

34:44.081 --> 34:45.735
Las Fieras,
and we can't prove it,

34:45.779 --> 34:47.607
but the bank manager
thinks he may have been

34:47.650 --> 34:48.844
siphoning funds
from the operation.

34:48.869 --> 34:50.130
Good way to get killed.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.848
If Las Fieras is already
suspicious of Carson...

34:51.871 --> 34:54.309
That's why he took the risk
of attacking the way he did.

34:54.353 --> 34:55.614
Well done.

34:55.658 --> 34:57.158
Yeah, but none of that
helps us finding.

34:57.182 --> 34:59.009
Miral's daughter or
the rest of those people.

34:59.053 --> 35:00.117
No, that's why
we need your help.

35:00.141 --> 35:01.360
We're running out of time.

35:01.403 --> 35:02.554
We've got 15, maybe 20 minutes

35:02.578 --> 35:04.363
before he gets
to those credit cards.

35:04.406 --> 35:06.321
Then he's gonna kill
those refugees.

35:06.365 --> 35:07.646
No, he said he'd set them free.
No, he can't

35:07.670 --> 35:09.039
afford to have witnesses
after what he's done.

35:09.063 --> 35:10.717
God. All right,

35:10.760 --> 35:11.718
Carson kept
that shipping container

35:11.761 --> 35:12.825
on the far end of your property.

35:12.849 --> 35:14.068
Yeah. He has moved it.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.635
We need to know where.

35:15.678 --> 35:17.395
Just think. He wouldn't have
taken it on any public road.

35:17.419 --> 35:19.441
He would've looked for an
obscure spot, somewhere where it

35:19.465 --> 35:20.770
was unlikely to be found.

35:20.814 --> 35:22.270
It's a pretty big container.
There aren't a lot

35:22.294 --> 35:24.818
of places to hide it. I
think I know where it is.

35:24.861 --> 35:26.100
Okay, well, tell us. I'll show you.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.300
Let's go.Better.

35:41.791 --> 35:43.750
This is it.

35:48.407 --> 35:50.583
You got what you wanted.

35:50.626 --> 35:52.367
Now you let everyone go.

35:52.411 --> 35:55.065
Sorry, pal,
that's not in the cards.

35:55.109 --> 35:56.502
We had a deal.

35:56.545 --> 35:59.809
Funny, I don't remember
the specifics.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.250
None of us will call the cops.

36:05.293 --> 36:07.121
Enough people have died.

36:09.471 --> 36:11.081
I won't let you do this.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.737
Won't let me do what?

36:18.306 --> 36:22.919
Get up. We got one more stop
to make.

36:29.404 --> 36:30.579
Which way?

36:30.623 --> 36:32.538
It's just up here.

36:40.023 --> 36:42.722
The bastard covered the vents.

36:44.854 --> 36:46.247
Can you hear us in there?

37:08.400 --> 37:09.836
Have you seen Aya?

37:09.879 --> 37:11.533
Do you know where she is? Aya?

37:14.406 --> 37:16.886
Aya, Miral's daughter,
where is she?

37:16.930 --> 37:18.845
I got her. I got her.

37:21.151 --> 37:22.370
Got her.

37:25.068 --> 37:26.853
Here. Yeah. Over here.

37:32.380 --> 37:33.947
Okay.

37:36.297 --> 37:37.951
Two... Come on, kid.

37:42.390 --> 37:45.088
Come on, kid.

37:53.923 --> 37:55.098
My God.

37:56.491 --> 37:58.928
Well...

38:00.060 --> 38:01.322
This is unfortunate.

38:01.366 --> 38:04.151
What are you gonna do, Carson?

38:04.194 --> 38:06.240
Kill us all? Don't have much choice.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.763
Can't have you
running to the cops.

38:07.807 --> 38:09.025
Where's Timbo?

38:09.069 --> 38:10.655
You don't have to worry
about Timbo anymore.

38:10.679 --> 38:12.464
You know, I don't think
you're gonna hurt us.

38:12.507 --> 38:14.422
Is that right? Yeah.

38:14.466 --> 38:15.728
'Cause if you let us live,

38:15.771 --> 38:17.271
you and your friends here
get to live, too.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.470
Your eyesight

38:18.513 --> 38:20.167
must not be very good
'cause these guns,

38:20.210 --> 38:22.169
they're pointed at you.Yeah.

38:22.212 --> 38:24.127
I've got something
better than guns.

38:24.171 --> 38:26.173
Intel. A certain bank manager

38:26.216 --> 38:27.522
just talked to Jim Saunders,

38:27.566 --> 38:29.394
one of our colleagues
back in Montreal.

38:29.437 --> 38:31.091
We called him on
the way over here.

38:31.134 --> 38:33.920
Saunders knows about
the offshore accounts.

38:33.963 --> 38:37.619
You kill us, he's gonna call
your friends down south.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.099
You're bluffing.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.625
We disappear,
you know what to do.

38:43.669 --> 38:45.758
10-4. We share Carson intel

38:45.801 --> 38:48.238
with Las Fieras.

38:48.282 --> 38:49.955
How long do you think
it'll take Las Fieras

38:49.979 --> 38:52.286
to realize you've been
skimming money off the top?

38:52.330 --> 38:54.593
Probably about as long
as it'll take them to retaliate.

38:54.636 --> 38:57.291
It's up to you. We all live

38:57.335 --> 38:59.380
or we all die.

39:07.301 --> 39:08.433
It's okay.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.130
Any of this gets out,

39:10.173 --> 39:11.740
I'll know that you leaked it,

39:11.784 --> 39:13.612
and I'm gonna come after you.

39:15.657 --> 39:17.572
Let's go.

39:19.182 --> 39:21.271
So they could just
get away with this?

39:21.315 --> 39:24.057
No. We called the police.
They won't get far.

39:26.668 --> 39:29.149
Aya, my name's Eric.

39:29.192 --> 39:32.326
I know someone who's gonna
be very happy to see you.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.980
Come on, let's get
you out of here.

39:57.438 --> 40:00.963
Here. You're okay.

40:15.108 --> 40:17.893
Just got off the phone
with Provincial Police.

40:17.937 --> 40:19.417
Carson and his men
are in custody.

40:19.460 --> 40:21.419
Charged with human
trafficking and murder.

40:21.462 --> 40:23.072
Another battle won.

40:23.116 --> 40:26.206
Soldiers generally win battles.
Generals get credit for them.

40:26.249 --> 40:27.468
Your buddy Wellington again?

40:27.512 --> 40:29.862
No, the other guy.

40:29.905 --> 40:32.647
You were talking to the
paramedics treating Timbo.

40:32.691 --> 40:36.216
Yeah, yeah. He's gonna need
surgery, but he's stable.

40:36.259 --> 40:38.174
Okay, good.-

40:38.218 --> 40:40.263
So what happens
to the refugees now?

40:40.307 --> 40:41.700
Well, under Canadian law,

40:41.743 --> 40:43.397
they have the right
to apply for asylum,

40:43.441 --> 40:45.680
and if they're in danger,
then they'll be allowed to stay.

40:45.704 --> 40:46.811
Meanwhile,
they're getting the food

40:46.835 --> 40:48.750
and medical attention
that they need.

40:48.794 --> 40:51.318
Speaking of which, there are
paramedics standing by

40:51.361 --> 40:54.103
for both of you.

40:56.366 --> 40:58.107
Okay. Thank you so much.

41:01.720 --> 41:03.939
Can we eat first?

41:03.983 --> 41:07.943
We're making dinner
for everyone.

41:07.987 --> 41:10.250
You want to join us? We
thought you'd never ask.

41:10.293 --> 41:12.165
Come on in. Okay.
