WEBVTT

00:29.112 --> 00:30.113
Shit.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.334
<i>Attention.</i>

02:05.792 --> 02:07.252
<i>The sun has set.</i>

02:07.252 --> 02:11.673
<i>Curfew is now lifted in accordance
with national ordinance 1138.</i>

02:14.009 --> 02:17.346
<i>Daytime curfew resumes at sunrise:</i>

02:17.346 --> 02:20.098
<i>6:11 a.m.</i>

02:20.098 --> 02:21.016
Is mine on?

02:21.016 --> 02:22.184
I'm taking one pull.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.686
Okay. Okay.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.032
Hey! Stop, fucker.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.200
You paid for only one puff.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.576
So add it to my tab.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.744
What tab?

02:40.744 --> 02:41.912
Hey.

02:41.912 --> 02:42.955
What?

02:42.955 --> 02:44.122
Give my brother one more shot.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.207
Will you pay for it?

02:59.096 --> 03:01.223
Did you wager on the cricket match
yesterday at Lords?

03:02.933 --> 03:04.810
Yes. I also lost three lakhs.

03:05.269 --> 03:06.103
Come on.

03:08.105 --> 03:11.733
Drought-resistant seeds!

03:11.733 --> 03:15.320
Wheat, Jowar, Bajra.

03:15.320 --> 03:18.198
Genuine Alpha seeds...

03:20.993 --> 03:22.953
So you're the driver?

03:22.953 --> 03:25.038
Mind your own business.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.711
Wheat, Jowar, Bajra.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.630
Genuine Alpha seeds...

03:35.215 --> 03:36.383
<i>Stay on him.</i>

03:49.188 --> 03:51.148
Wait here. I'm going inside.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.316
Hurry up.

04:07.873 --> 04:08.874
Hey.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.013
Come on.

04:23.472 --> 04:24.473
What is that?

04:24.473 --> 04:25.390
What?

04:25.390 --> 04:26.725
Can't you see that light?

04:27.184 --> 04:28.435
That?

04:28.435 --> 04:32.105
Maybe it's the sun
and we'll all be dead in eight minutes.

04:32.731 --> 04:35.400
You come on. Come on.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.758
I am feeling hungry.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.769
Hey, you're the driver, Gaurav, right?

05:11.770 --> 05:13.063
Come, eat some biryani.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.942
It's not real rice.
It's that synthetic, processed crap.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.695
Did you hear that outside?

05:19.695 --> 05:22.614
Hey.
Did you read the detail? English only.

05:23.532 --> 05:24.533
What?

05:24.533 --> 05:27.995
The detail. It says me
and you are to speak in English only.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.580
Why?

05:29.580 --> 05:32.040
I don't know.
A security measure or something.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.751
These higher-ups and their demands.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.003
I could do it in Hindi!

05:36.879 --> 05:39.590
I speak good Hindi!

05:41.550 --> 05:43.510
But I never go against the detail.

05:44.428 --> 05:45.971
Anyway, come eat. I'm Neel.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.683
Something exploded in the sky.

05:50.267 --> 05:53.437
My man said it was a drone. Uber Eats.

05:53.437 --> 05:54.605
Not a drone.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.064
What then?

05:56.064 --> 05:56.982
Not a drone.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.192
Airplane, maybe.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.943
Not an aeroplane.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.153
Then what?

06:02.112 --> 06:03.280
I don't know.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.450
It doesn't matter anyway.
Over there. That's you.

06:07.826 --> 06:08.785
Diesel?

06:08.785 --> 06:10.871
If it wasn't diesel, we wouldn't need you.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.250
Self-driving autos
are driving you guys to extinction.

06:16.502 --> 06:17.794
I'm not paying for diesel.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.005
Last time they didn't give me reimbursement.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.798
There's a cash allotment for fuel.

06:22.591 --> 06:23.717
There better be.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.135
I just said there was.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.386
How much is it?

06:26.386 --> 06:27.971
Enough to get you to Varanasi.

06:28.514 --> 06:29.765
Varanasi?

06:29.765 --> 06:31.600
Yeah. Varanasi first,
and then up north somewhere.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.352
- There's two shifts?
- Yeah.

06:33.352 --> 06:35.062
- I don't do double shifts.
- Says who?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.355
It's in my contract.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.358
You have a contract?

06:39.816 --> 06:41.360
- Verbal.
- Verbal contract.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.654
Madam knows, madam is aware.

06:43.654 --> 06:45.656
That's between you and Madam.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.741
The job is a double shift.
Do you want it or not?

06:48.242 --> 06:49.535
No double shifts.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.788
In that case, fuck off.

06:52.788 --> 06:55.165
Watch your mouth, asshole.

06:55.165 --> 06:58.794
Listen.
You didn't even ask me how much it pays.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.214
10,000 euros.

07:04.633 --> 07:05.717
Ten thousand...

07:05.717 --> 07:06.802
Euros.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.596
Ten thousand euro.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.849
Five up front. Five on completion.

07:12.975 --> 07:15.018
No, ten thousand euro to drive?

07:16.186 --> 07:17.187
To drive what?

07:17.688 --> 07:20.816
I don't know.
It doesn't matter. Cargo is cargo.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.484
I don't agree.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.278
So, what's it gonna be?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.125
Let's go.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.294
Huh?

07:40.294 --> 07:41.545
- Let's go.
- Where are you going?

07:41.545 --> 07:43.046
Me and you, road trip.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.673
Thirty-five hours to Varanasi,

07:44.673 --> 07:48.218
and I hope you like country-western
because that is my jam!

07:48.218 --> 07:49.511
No.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.263
You take the bus or something.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.890
I drive alone. I always drive alone.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.224
It is safe.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.143
Madam specifies we go together.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.437
Why do you want to go to Varanasi?

07:58.437 --> 08:03.275
I don't know, mate.
I'm on the job, exactly the same as you.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.402
I'm not lifting you
in and out of the truck, okay?

08:05.986 --> 08:06.820
Understand?

08:17.372 --> 08:18.498
Let's go!

08:39.561 --> 08:42.313
All the trucks in Mumbai, and
we get the one with blown-out speakers.

08:43.815 --> 08:48.779
What do you do when you drive? Music?
News radio? Meditation? What?

08:49.655 --> 08:51.823
For me, it's music. Always music, man.

08:52.324 --> 08:55.786
Obviously country-western,
but rap, EDM, trap.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.162
I love songs from the movies.

08:59.998 --> 09:00.999
That's it.

09:02.459 --> 09:06.004
Are you married? Have a girl? A guy?

09:07.464 --> 09:09.091
Me, I'm not married.

09:09.091 --> 09:12.010
I had a girl,
but after I lost the leg here...

09:13.011 --> 09:15.013
she went and got with someone else.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.934
I was pissed, man, but I get it.

09:20.811 --> 09:21.770
Do you like movies?

09:22.646 --> 09:23.605
No.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.357
I fucking love movies, man.

09:25.357 --> 09:28.861
Romance, history, drama, action.
I don't care.

09:28.861 --> 09:33.740
My sweetie and I, before she left me,
we'd spend all day in the cinema.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.703
Poor girl. She couldn't be marrying
some cripple, you know?

09:37.703 --> 09:40.455
But I do earn.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.040
I'm not some loser.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.376
I'm hoping word gets back
to her, you know,

09:44.376 --> 09:48.088
and she's like,
"Neel, international gangster.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.508
Maybe he earns more than
the current dickhead I'm curled up with."

09:51.508 --> 09:53.260
Maybe she comes around, you know.

09:53.969 --> 09:56.722
A man's gotta believe.
Happily ever after, like the movies.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.974
How much will it cost to shut you up?

09:59.850 --> 10:01.018
I don't wanna hear about some bitch

10:01.018 --> 10:01.977
who ran off with somebody else.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.979
Watch your mouth.
Talking about my girl.

10:03.979 --> 10:05.689
You want a woman who ran away
with another man?

10:05.689 --> 10:07.149
- You have no shame.
- You don't know the full story.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.109
I don't want to know the full story.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.278
She's gone. Forget about her.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.946
Okay?
Now shut up and sit and let me drive.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.531
I didn't ask you for an in-depth analysis.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.866
Hardly in-depth.

10:15.866 --> 10:18.493
Fuck you, man!
I believe in things, all right?

10:24.166 --> 10:26.835
So what's your thing?
What are you gonna do when you get paid?

10:27.669 --> 10:32.049
Send it back to the family?
Spend it all on whores, drugs, what?

10:32.591 --> 10:34.218
None of your business.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.265
You got that asthma?

10:40.265 --> 10:42.434
And you pull from that dirty thing?

10:46.146 --> 10:47.606
Nas-Bots, bro.

10:50.984 --> 10:51.985
This is the shit.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.695
I don't put robots in my nose.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.322
Nanobots, not robots.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.908
Internal filters. Easier, cheaper.

10:57.908 --> 11:00.160
And you don't have to be sucking on
that filthy mask all day.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.162
They track you with that. You don't know.

11:02.663 --> 11:03.664
Who tracks you?

11:03.664 --> 11:04.873
Corporations.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.334
Corporations don't need nanobots
to track us, mate.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.419
They've got us by the balls already.

11:10.587 --> 11:11.839
I knew guys like you in the war.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.509
You were in the war?

11:16.093 --> 11:19.346
Yes, sir. Fifteenth Infantry, Amritsar.

11:21.473 --> 11:22.307
How was that?

11:22.307 --> 11:25.352
How was the war? Fucking mega, mate.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.938
Pakistan used chemical weapons, or what?

11:27.938 --> 11:29.690
- Not that I saw.
- I heard they did.

11:29.690 --> 11:30.691
Some conspiracy theory.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.484
I heard the war is still going on.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.736
You're a fucking idiot.
I was in the war. It ended.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.613
Everyone has a different story.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.198
I heard it's still going on.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.284
We keep going in,
but those people are like cockroaches,

11:40.284 --> 11:41.869
you kill one, and three more come out.

11:41.869 --> 11:42.953
What people?

11:43.620 --> 11:44.955
Muslims.

11:45.664 --> 11:47.416
I heard it's strictly black-ops now.

11:47.416 --> 11:48.500
The war.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.252
Where are you hearing this?

11:50.252 --> 11:51.170
News.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.296
What news?

11:52.296 --> 11:54.047
Just... news.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.466
Listen, the news you're
listening to is some bullshit news.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.135
You're gonna sit there
and you're gonna tell me

11:58.135 --> 12:00.012
that you know more about the war
that I fought in?

12:00.012 --> 12:02.764
We didn't need any chemical weapons.
We got plenty fucked without 'em.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.349
Where were you during the war?

12:05.350 --> 12:06.476
I had exemption.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.978
What exemption?

12:10.856 --> 12:12.399
Ministry of Agriculture.

12:13.275 --> 12:14.109
Crops died.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.195
My father killed himself
and then my brothers, too.

12:17.654 --> 12:18.822
You're agro-exempt?

12:21.491 --> 12:23.744
Your family. I'm sorry.

12:25.913 --> 12:26.914
Where are you from?

12:26.914 --> 12:27.831
Bihar.

12:27.831 --> 12:28.790
Where in Bihar?

12:28.790 --> 12:30.209
Some village you don't know.

12:30.876 --> 12:31.877
Fucking hell.

12:31.877 --> 12:33.545
Birds. Every night.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.172
It's because of us.

12:36.048 --> 12:38.091
We start living at night
and they start flying around,

12:38.091 --> 12:39.801
after hours, causing mass suicide.

12:40.469 --> 12:41.970
Just like my family.

12:42.513 --> 12:43.931
My family is dead too, mate.

12:44.806 --> 12:45.974
Mine just died of cancer.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.559
Because the air is poison.

12:47.559 --> 12:50.103
The air isn't poison.
We don't have cancer, do we?

12:50.103 --> 12:51.230
Not yet.

12:51.647 --> 12:52.648
Not ever.

12:53.732 --> 12:54.942
Things are gonna get better.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.152
- Okay.
- They will.

12:57.152 --> 12:58.362
- How?
- They will.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.157
- How?
- Trust me. They will.

13:17.381 --> 13:19.007
Sun's out. Bedtime.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.304
What's that stitching on your bag?
The staples?

13:25.889 --> 13:27.599
It works, it's called improvising.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.101
No wonder you're single.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.062
Why don't you get a fake leg?

13:32.062 --> 13:35.232
I don't earn that prosthetic cash,
even in this lavish life of crime.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.195
Tell me how it is
that a farmer's son from Bihar

13:40.195 --> 13:42.197
starts working for Madam out of Mumbai?

13:43.448 --> 13:45.742
You should be proud, man. I am.

13:45.742 --> 13:50.080
I mean, you're earning decent money
on account of semi-honest work.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.834
I mean, 10,000 euros
is nothing to laugh at in this economy.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.002
When I get paid,

13:56.545 --> 13:58.630
I think I'm gonna take sweetie to Kuwait.

13:59.590 --> 14:02.259
Two nights at the Four Seasons.
Yeah, just me and her.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.677
What if she says no?

14:03.677 --> 14:05.012
Fuck is your problem, man?

14:06.430 --> 14:07.848
I'm just asking.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.309
My most cherished dream,
and you're just shitting on it.

14:10.309 --> 14:11.852
Anything is possible, you know.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.645
I mean,
it could start snowing outside any minute.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.606
Rains could come back
and grow a rain forest

14:15.606 --> 14:17.482
from here to your desert planet of Bihar.

14:17.983 --> 14:20.694
I mean, we could colonize Mars,
we could colonize the oceans.

14:21.195 --> 14:25.073
And me and sweetie, we could find
ourselves in the Four Seasons

14:25.073 --> 14:26.408
for two nights in Kuwait.

14:26.408 --> 14:28.410
A man's gotta believe, you know.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.208
For me, when I get the money,
I want to go to Goa.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.461
I hear they have women on the beach
who are giving pedicures.

14:39.129 --> 14:42.382
Also with the manicures,
scalp massage, ear cleaning.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.718
You want someone
to clean your ears and cut your toenails?

14:44.718 --> 14:46.386
No, no, it's much more than that.

14:46.720 --> 14:50.599
They're giving head massage,
cleaning, pumice stone.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.393
Sometimes happy ending also.

14:54.269 --> 14:55.521
How much does that cost?

14:58.982 --> 14:59.942
I don't know.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.110
10,000 will last you plenty, mate.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.238
Maybe forever.

15:05.447 --> 15:08.158
At least until the world ends,
which is probably soon.

15:08.158 --> 15:10.160
You're very depressing, you know that?

15:11.370 --> 15:13.539
The world isn't
necessarily gonna end, okay?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.583
I mean, fuck CIT 2.

15:17.251 --> 15:20.921
We can put that stuff in the atmosphere
and things could get better.

15:21.255 --> 15:22.714
Geoengineering.

15:23.215 --> 15:25.425
The volcano did it, so can we.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.929
The volcano from Micronesia.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.347
Philippines.

15:30.347 --> 15:31.265
It was Micronesia.

15:31.265 --> 15:33.058
The point is the world can change.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.936
Temperature can fluctuate both ways.

15:37.020 --> 15:40.148
Volcano spews ash into the air,
temperatures got cooler.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.901
It happened before,
and it can happen again.

15:43.652 --> 15:47.114
So you want someone to launch
reflective chemicals into the atmosphere

15:47.447 --> 15:48.991
in the hope that it will cool the planet

15:48.991 --> 15:50.576
and save life on Earth?

15:51.785 --> 15:53.078
And you think I'm stupid?

15:53.328 --> 15:58.375
I'm saying you've gotta believe in
possibilities and happy fucking endings.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.801
<i>Mr. Bilton is concerned.</i>

16:07.801 --> 16:10.470
I took care of the plane.
I can take care of this.

16:18.937 --> 16:19.980
Welcome back, ma'am.

16:24.359 --> 16:26.445
Yes, here is your reservation.

16:26.445 --> 16:29.573
Alpha has booked you
in a luxury suite with a terrace.

16:29.573 --> 16:33.160
Charges have been taken care of,
as well as incidentals.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.953
What brings you back to Mumbai, ma'am?

16:34.953 --> 16:36.788
I wanna be a movie star.

16:37.748 --> 16:39.458
Well, you've come to the right place.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.335
- Allow me.
- Leave it.

16:42.628 --> 16:44.505
Is the bar in the room stocked?

16:44.505 --> 16:45.589
Yes, ma'am.

16:45.589 --> 16:48.091
Bring some ice.
See that I'm not disturbed.

16:51.553 --> 16:56.892
<i>Daytime curfew resumes at sunrise:
6:12 a.m.</i>

16:57.267 --> 16:58.810
Wet bulb 31.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.104
<i>An extreme heat warning is in effect.</i>

17:01.104 --> 17:02.773
I wonder how many people died.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.776
Sun's down. Let's go.

17:17.371 --> 17:18.747
You still sucking on that thing.

17:19.665 --> 17:21.250
Try my Nas-Bot. Try it!

17:22.000 --> 17:23.417
Try it! Look!

17:24.252 --> 17:26.421
Keep that robot out of my face
or I'll throw it out of the fucking truck.

17:26.421 --> 17:27.881
I'd like to see you try that.

17:28.507 --> 17:30.217
You making fun of me?

17:32.678 --> 17:33.929
Oh, shit.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.973
What? Shit.

17:35.973 --> 17:38.600
No, no, it's okay.
It's just routine checking.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.935
You know our story, right?

17:39.935 --> 17:41.144
What are we doing?

17:41.144 --> 17:44.314
We are transporting
"Cool-Fan-Nice" electric fans to Varanasi.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.482
And why am I here?

17:46.483 --> 17:48.026
You're our company supervisor.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.486
And we have the paperwork to show for it

17:49.486 --> 17:51.154
- if they wanna look, okay?
- Uh-huh.

17:51.655 --> 17:53.073
Just don't speak in Hindi, okay?

17:53.073 --> 17:55.909
My Hindi's fine.
Hey, listen, if I end up outside

17:55.909 --> 17:58.412
and my chair's still back there,
push it out, all right?

18:20.976 --> 18:22.477
What's the problem, sir? Everything okay?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.396
Reports of smugglers.
Get out of the truck.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.899
I'm in a wheelchair.
Can you give me a moment--

18:31.528 --> 18:32.446
Please, sir, please!

18:32.446 --> 18:34.615
- Out of the truck now!
- What's going on?

18:38.118 --> 18:40.495
Yes, sir, we're only transporting
electric fans, sir,

18:40.495 --> 18:41.747
to Varanasi.

18:42.331 --> 18:44.333
Sure you are.

18:45.334 --> 18:46.543
They're just electric fans.

18:46.543 --> 18:47.920
Open the fucking doors.

18:50.047 --> 18:51.465
You see, sir?

18:53.550 --> 18:54.468
Sir.

18:54.468 --> 18:56.220
Electric fans, Cool-Fan-Nice.

19:15.072 --> 19:16.073
What do you got?

19:19.952 --> 19:20.911
Hurry up.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.629
Hey, motherfucker.

19:30.629 --> 19:32.589
On your knees, hands behind your head.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.424
I swear, I'm just a driver.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.593
You're just a driver, eh?

19:36.927 --> 19:38.554
Hey! What'd you find?

19:39.596 --> 19:41.348
- You think we're idiots?
- It's just a lunch box, sir.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.808
- Just a lunch box?
- Yes, sir.

19:42.808 --> 19:45.644
All right, sonny,
get ready to meet your maker.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.241
You all right?

20:13.755 --> 20:15.883
The fuck are you doing? Start the truck.

20:20.512 --> 20:21.889
What's in the lunch box?

20:21.889 --> 20:23.140
I don't know.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.224
You don't know?

20:24.558 --> 20:26.143
Who knows?

20:26.143 --> 20:27.227
It's not my business.

20:27.227 --> 20:28.770
Then how do the police know?

20:30.063 --> 20:31.148
They went straight for the tiffin.

20:31.148 --> 20:34.109
Must have got tipped off by some rival.
We need to dump the truck.

20:34.109 --> 20:35.986
- Dump the truck? Dump the tr--
- Yeah.

20:35.986 --> 20:38.113
You think this is some backpack?
Where will you dump the truck?

20:38.113 --> 20:39.781
I know a spot 5K up.

20:40.407 --> 20:43.243
It's on the left, but slow down.
It's barely a road at all. You'll miss it.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.162
Where did they teach you shooting
like that?

20:45.662 --> 20:46.705
In the army?

20:47.497 --> 20:49.583
I'm not that fucking stupid.

20:49.583 --> 20:50.876
You hear me?

20:50.876 --> 20:52.461
You killed three policemen.

20:53.045 --> 20:55.547
You killed three policemen,
now tell me what we'll do.

20:55.839 --> 20:56.924
Tell me what we'll do.

20:58.175 --> 20:59.426
Just drive.

21:01.470 --> 21:03.013
Your Hindi is shit.

21:04.014 --> 21:05.807
<i>Three officers slain... Katni...</i>

21:06.600 --> 21:10.103
<i>Gunshot wounds... Possible organized hit...</i>

21:11.230 --> 21:12.481
<i>There are two suspects,</i>

21:12.481 --> 21:14.399
<i>one is in a wheelchair,
the other is the truck driver.</i>

21:14.399 --> 21:15.776
<i>What do you have?</i>

21:15.776 --> 21:18.695
I think I can put them in Katni
in the last hour, moving east.

21:18.695 --> 21:20.197
<i>I'll let our friends at Alpha know.</i>

21:20.197 --> 21:23.325
No, don't. Let me get eyes on 'em first.

21:31.375 --> 21:33.460
The package will be
in my hands by sundown.

21:35.546 --> 21:37.840
<i>You do know
who you're dealing with, don't you?</i>

21:38.340 --> 21:39.341
Uh-huh.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.473
What's in the tiffin?

21:46.473 --> 21:47.474
I don't know.

21:47.474 --> 21:48.642
Open it and see.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.895
It's fingerprint coded.
Only Madam can open it.

21:54.982 --> 21:55.816
Okay, stop.

21:56.108 --> 21:58.068
Stop, stop. Just one minute, stop.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.361
Okay.

21:59.778 --> 22:01.196
What are we doing?

22:01.530 --> 22:03.323
You just killed three policemen,
you know that?

22:03.991 --> 22:05.492
The bodies are lying there
at the checkpoint.

22:05.492 --> 22:07.744
The whole state police are looking for us.
We're criminals.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.955
We still need to get to Varanasi.

22:10.914 --> 22:12.499
How will we get to Varanasi?

22:12.499 --> 22:14.376
We just dumped the truck over there.

22:15.377 --> 22:19.173
See that backcountry road over there?
Pilgrims pass through there all the time.

22:19.173 --> 22:21.008
You and me,
a cripple and his poor brother,

22:21.008 --> 22:22.676
looking to offer prayers in the holy city.

22:22.676 --> 22:24.511
When the bus stops, we'll jump on.

22:26.013 --> 22:26.847
No.

22:30.559 --> 22:31.435
I'm going back.

22:33.353 --> 22:34.771
You go back now, you won't get paid.

22:34.771 --> 22:36.064
I don't care.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.566
Okay? This has gone out of control.

22:37.566 --> 22:40.027
And what do you think is gonna happen
when you go back to Mumbai?

22:40.027 --> 22:42.905
Why do you think Madam chose you
for this job in the first place?

22:45.324 --> 22:46.241
Because I work for Madam.

22:46.241 --> 22:47.326
For this.

22:48.243 --> 22:52.206
This extremely important job that's paying
you quadruple what you ever made before.

22:53.123 --> 22:55.751
Where this cargo is clearly of high value.

22:55.751 --> 22:58.629
You, Gaurav,
are the best choice for this job.

22:59.796 --> 23:03.467
No. Madam has 20 drivers
that outrank your skinny arse.

23:04.051 --> 23:08.013
Seven of them turned up dead last week.
The rest, God only knows.

23:08.013 --> 23:12.142
So it turns out, the only driver unknown
to Madam's enemies is you.

23:12.809 --> 23:15.479
You're so insignificant
that no one even knows you exist.

23:16.772 --> 23:18.232
Of course, now you're famous.

23:20.692 --> 23:24.071
Do what you want.
Stay, get fucked or come with me.

23:24.696 --> 23:27.324
I'm going back to the safety
of Madam's warm embrace.

23:47.970 --> 23:48.971
Game of Chicken?

23:48.971 --> 23:50.264
Excuse me?

23:50.264 --> 23:53.308
What you're watching. Game of Chicken.
Reality show.

23:53.308 --> 23:55.727
Ordinary folks jousting homemade drones.

23:57.104 --> 23:58.981
This isn't Game of Chicken.

24:07.197 --> 24:10.367
I don't think they teach
shooting guns like that in the army.

24:13.579 --> 24:16.206
You're what, some assassin? Sharpshooter?

24:16.206 --> 24:17.291
Bodyguard.

24:19.001 --> 24:20.544
Bodyguard for Madam.

24:21.670 --> 24:23.088
No, dickhead, for you.

24:29.094 --> 24:32.097
I never held a gun before in my hand.

24:33.307 --> 24:36.393
Actually I've never even heard
the sound of one until today.

24:37.227 --> 24:38.228
You're lucky.

24:39.354 --> 24:41.356
How many people have you killed
before tonight?

24:43.650 --> 24:44.651
More than I'd like.

24:46.153 --> 24:47.654
I've never wanted to kill anyone.

24:49.531 --> 24:52.868
War was quick, man,
but it left a mark, you know.

24:55.120 --> 24:59.249
I've got all these skills, and I can do
these things, and I'm not happy about it.

25:01.835 --> 25:05.172
The way I see it is,
I've gotta balance out my acts.

25:05.881 --> 25:08.634
For every evil action,
some good administered as well.

25:10.385 --> 25:14.848
I saved your life, so that was
one life saved for three lives gone.

25:15.349 --> 25:19.061
That means I have to save two more lives
just to cancel out the violence tonight.

25:22.064 --> 25:24.066
And overall? Before tonight?

25:24.066 --> 25:26.109
Are your karmic scales balanced?

25:44.586 --> 25:46.588
Yes, sir. I have, sir, yes.

25:48.006 --> 25:49.967
Not yet, sir. Nothing, no.

25:52.261 --> 25:56.723
Well, either dead, arrested,
hiding or on their way here.

25:57.724 --> 26:00.310
Well, I hope so too, sir, obviously.

26:00.310 --> 26:01.895
Sir, can I call you back?

26:04.439 --> 26:06.066
You're shitting me. They're here?

26:14.992 --> 26:16.410
Howdy, Anusha, madam.

26:16.410 --> 26:18.036
What the fuck, Neel?

26:18.036 --> 26:19.830
- They were tipped off.
- Bullshit.

26:19.830 --> 26:21.498
You went gun-happy, as always.

26:21.498 --> 26:24.334
No, Madam, that corrupt police
were waiting for us near Katni.

26:24.334 --> 26:25.460
Who the fuck are you?

26:25.460 --> 26:26.378
Gaurav, Madam, driver.

26:26.378 --> 26:27.296
Have I ever met you?

26:27.296 --> 26:28.505
No, first time.

26:28.505 --> 26:29.965
Why are you speaking to me?

26:29.965 --> 26:32.593
Madam, Gaurav did well.
He didn't crack under pressure, all right?

26:32.593 --> 26:35.596
Police knew exactly what they were looking
for. They went straight for the tiffin.

26:35.596 --> 26:37.639
And these guys weren't
about any code of ethics either.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.474
- So you killed them?
- Them or us in this instance.

26:39.474 --> 26:40.392
I swear to God.

26:41.393 --> 26:43.228
Anyway, cargo's delivered.

26:47.774 --> 26:50.152
What's in there anyway?
What have we been carrying all this time?

26:51.695 --> 26:54.448
- This needs to be in Amritsar by tomorrow.
- Amritsar?

26:54.448 --> 26:57.492
But here's the thing, Mr. Terminator,

26:57.492 --> 27:00.871
the entire military apparatus of MP
are looking for two men.

27:00.871 --> 27:02.748
One of whom is in a wheelchair.

27:02.748 --> 27:04.208
So, why do I have to go along?

27:04.208 --> 27:06.210
Job isn't finished. You want payment?

27:06.210 --> 27:09.254
All I'm saying, ma'am, is risk assessment.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.673
We are taking precautions.

27:11.673 --> 27:14.593
You two bastards are driving by day.

27:20.974 --> 27:24.853
Solar-powered. AC. Built-in filtration.

27:24.853 --> 27:27.648
<i>"Centre de la sante et vie."</i>

27:27.648 --> 27:29.650
It's a fake French NGO we made up.

27:29.650 --> 27:32.945
- I think the French is wrong.
- Who the fuck cares, Neel? It's French.

27:32.945 --> 27:35.781
From a distance, the police will think
you're relief workers.

27:35.781 --> 27:39.201
Self-drives,
but Mohan here has deactivated it.

27:39.201 --> 27:41.286
Self-driving cars get tagged on the grid,

27:41.286 --> 27:45.040
so there's no way to get by undetected,
especially during the day.

27:45.040 --> 27:48.210
It's imported, so it's left-hand drive.
Can you handle that?

27:48.210 --> 27:49.127
Yes, madam.

27:49.127 --> 27:52.005
Mohan's made a number
of adjustments to prepare for the heat.

27:52.005 --> 27:55.759
Enhanced AC, deeper tint,
and he's made room for your wheelchair.

27:55.759 --> 27:57.177
Much obliged.

27:57.177 --> 27:58.136
Will this melt?

27:59.304 --> 28:02.140
Vehicle's equipped
with a wet-bulb temperature reading.

28:02.140 --> 28:04.268
Measuring heat and humidity combined.

28:04.268 --> 28:07.229
If wet-bulb spikes to 33,
alarm will sound.

28:07.229 --> 28:09.147
You will assemble the mirror tent stored
in back.

28:09.731 --> 28:12.401
It's automatic,
but it takes about two minutes to expand.

28:12.401 --> 28:14.444
Also, if you're driving on pavement,

28:14.444 --> 28:16.738
pull off to dirt
because the blacktop tends to melt.

28:17.447 --> 28:21.243
Hear that? The road will fucking melt.
This is just festive.

28:21.243 --> 28:23.495
The mirror tent covers the entire vehicle.

28:24.037 --> 28:27.082
You stay within the tent,
or you'll end up like our friend.

28:27.082 --> 28:28.250
Who's our friend?

28:29.459 --> 28:30.752
- Him.
- Who is he?

28:30.752 --> 28:33.005
- Your additional cargo.
- What's wrong with him?

28:33.005 --> 28:35.757
Idiot was out collecting data
during goddamn daylight

28:35.757 --> 28:37.509
when wet-bulb spiked to 35.

28:37.509 --> 28:40.971
He should be dead. He went into
hyperthermic shock, and he went blind.

28:40.971 --> 28:43.307
Although, his eyesight is returning now.

28:43.807 --> 28:46.977
The worst part is the delirium.
Our man could barely speak for two weeks.

28:46.977 --> 28:49.897
And now he's sometimes lucid.
Sometimes he's a fucking disaster.

28:51.106 --> 28:53.525
Harbaksh, Uncle, how are you feeling?

28:54.985 --> 28:56.403
Yes. Good, beta.

28:56.403 --> 28:58.238
Are you ready to leave tomorrow?

28:58.238 --> 29:00.949
- Leave?
- You'll be going north to Amritsar.

29:00.949 --> 29:02.201
Remember? I told you.

29:02.201 --> 29:04.077
Yeah, yeah, Amritsar, let's go.

29:04.077 --> 29:05.996
He some big shot, or what?

29:05.996 --> 29:08.332
Dr. Harbaksh Mann. Genetic scientist.

29:08.332 --> 29:09.708
Without him, the seeds are useless.

29:09.708 --> 29:10.959
What seeds?

29:10.959 --> 29:14.129
The fucking seeds, Neel.
What do you think this is about?

29:15.797 --> 29:17.716
Everything is going to change now.

29:21.512 --> 29:23.013
<i>Scientists are divided</i>

29:23.013 --> 29:26.183
<i>in their prediction of how
global weather patterns will be affected</i>

29:26.183 --> 29:29.061
<i>by what is now being called
an act of ecoterrorism.</i>

29:29.061 --> 29:31.355
Sardar-ji, what's in the tiffin? Seeds?

29:31.355 --> 29:32.814
Seeds. Yes, seeds.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.900
- What kinda seeds?
- Many seeds.

29:35.859 --> 29:36.860
Give me your hand.

29:36.860 --> 29:39.655
<i>...catastrophic changes
in precipitation levels</i>

29:39.655 --> 29:41.448
<i>in all regions is causing chaos...</i>

29:41.448 --> 29:42.533
Rice seeds?

29:42.533 --> 29:43.992
Rice seeds?

29:44.493 --> 29:47.120
We've been smuggling rice seeds
all this while? Great.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.914
Yes. Special seed.

29:48.914 --> 29:50.290
What's special about them?

29:50.290 --> 29:54.378
Well, all seeds are special, beta.
Each one a miracle.

29:54.378 --> 29:56.129
What's special about these seeds?

29:56.129 --> 29:57.214
Those?

29:57.965 --> 30:00.384
Those are stolen
from the seed vault at Svalbard.

30:00.384 --> 30:01.635
Do you know what he's talking about?

30:02.928 --> 30:04.888
Fucking rice seeds all this time.

30:06.223 --> 30:09.226
Uncle, you're a scientist.
Settle a dispute.

30:10.102 --> 30:12.729
Geoengineering blasting that shit
into the atmosphere.

30:12.729 --> 30:14.940
- Will it save the world? Yes or no?
- Yes.

30:15.899 --> 30:18.819
See, Gaurav? Hope springs eternal.

30:18.819 --> 30:20.195
Remember he's cracked.

30:20.904 --> 30:23.866
So, tell us, Uncle. How does it work?
How is it that we control the weather?

30:24.533 --> 30:27.911
Centuries ago,
tribes of nomads dyed the desert floor,

30:27.911 --> 30:30.831
blackening acres of space to make it hot

30:30.831 --> 30:34.710
and to increase air convection
so as to encourage precipitation.

30:34.710 --> 30:35.961
This is the same principle.

30:35.961 --> 30:37.796
- And did it work back then?
- No.

30:38.922 --> 30:39.882
So why now?

30:39.882 --> 30:42.342
They had it wrong. They were too far away.

30:49.141 --> 30:51.059
Farmer boy, you know about seeds, right?

30:51.059 --> 30:52.978
These look special to you?

30:55.230 --> 30:56.481
Like any other seed.

30:57.900 --> 30:59.026
You have the microscope app?

31:03.488 --> 31:04.323
Zoom in.

31:07.451 --> 31:09.453
- They don't have the watermark.
- So?

31:09.453 --> 31:12.456
So, every seed in the world is owned
by the Big Agro corporations.

31:12.998 --> 31:15.751
So they can prove their ownership,
they all have the watermark, or

31:15.959 --> 31:17.169
scan code, or whatever.

31:17.169 --> 31:19.046
- Another grand conspiracy.
- All right.

31:19.046 --> 31:22.007
This is not a conspiracy.
This is why you should not read too much.

31:24.968 --> 31:26.929
He said they were stolen
from a seed vault.

31:28.055 --> 31:30.098
I heard there was something like that
near the North Pole

31:30.098 --> 31:32.935
where all the original seeds of the world
are stored.

31:33.894 --> 31:36.772
But even if it's true, none of these old
seeds will grow anymore. Not in this heat.

31:36.772 --> 31:38.273
Hasn't rained in over a year.

31:38.649 --> 31:39.650
They're worthless.

31:40.484 --> 31:42.152
What do genetic scientists do?

31:42.152 --> 31:44.279
Madam said the seeds were useless
without him.

31:44.279 --> 31:46.323
They're the ones
putting the codes on the seeds.

31:46.323 --> 31:49.117
So Sardar-ji's gonna code the seeds
for Madam and the higher-ups?

31:49.117 --> 31:50.869
Just to copyright the seeds?

31:50.869 --> 31:53.664
Or they could clone them
and give them to farmers. But...

31:53.664 --> 31:55.791
There's no point. They won't grow.

31:57.584 --> 31:59.294
Not unless it starts to rain again.

31:59.962 --> 32:01.672
In Allah's hands.

32:02.506 --> 32:04.925
If He wants it to rain, it will rain.

32:07.719 --> 32:10.138
Sardar-ji! Come here! Let's go!

32:12.432 --> 32:15.143
They left by daylight,
taking back roads north.

32:16.770 --> 32:19.439
Most likely
through the Bhajowali River Valley.

32:19.439 --> 32:21.608
<i>How do you know?</i>

32:21.608 --> 32:23.277
I don't know. Intuition?

32:23.944 --> 32:26.405
<i>Mr. Bilton will want more than intuition.</i>

32:27.447 --> 32:31.368
Well, if my intuition isn't good enough,
you can find somebody else to track them.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.044
You're off course, man.

32:41.044 --> 32:42.171
The map says we are not.

32:42.171 --> 32:43.088
We're fucking lost.

32:43.088 --> 32:44.298
Look, can you relax?

32:44.298 --> 32:46.508
Okay? Just don't give me tension,
I'm driving, let me drive.

32:47.926 --> 32:49.344
What the fuck is that?

32:49.344 --> 32:50.387
What?

32:50.387 --> 32:51.847
Look at those little bastards.

32:52.806 --> 32:55.225
- What are they doing out in the daylight?
- I don't know.

32:56.476 --> 32:57.561
What is that?

32:59.396 --> 33:00.856
What the fuck?

33:01.899 --> 33:03.984
- People are starving all over...
- Where are the parents?

33:03.984 --> 33:05.652
...and children are using fruit
as a weapon now!

33:05.652 --> 33:07.029
Fuck you and your mango slingshot!

33:07.029 --> 33:08.614
What the fuck is wrong with the world!

33:08.614 --> 33:11.366
I didn't survive the war
to be killed by a fucking summer fruit!

33:11.366 --> 33:13.243
You've lost it! Get back in!

33:13.243 --> 33:15.245
Are you nuts?

33:15.245 --> 33:17.122
You want the police to come back?

33:17.623 --> 33:19.041
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

33:19.041 --> 33:21.793
Wet-bulb alert. Go get the mirror tent.
Let's go. Quick. Let's go!

33:22.127 --> 33:23.754
I hope their village is nearby.

33:23.754 --> 33:25.547
Those children are going to boil to death.

33:25.547 --> 33:27.466
Let 'em cook, the little bastards.

33:52.449 --> 33:55.786
Moving target. Launch trajectory.

33:56.578 --> 33:57.579
Good shot.

34:08.422 --> 34:09.424
Fuck.

34:16.348 --> 34:18.891
The little mango motherfucker's
passing out, man.

34:19.434 --> 34:20.601
What?

34:20.601 --> 34:23.897
The kid with the mango. He's stroking out.
His waste friends have fucking left him.

34:23.897 --> 34:25.815
Hey, Neel! Come inside and sit in the car!

34:25.815 --> 34:26.900
Can't do it! Karma.

34:26.900 --> 34:27.818
Neel!

34:27.818 --> 34:29.194
Balance. Way of the world.

34:29.194 --> 34:30.737
Hey, asshole, you'll faint!

34:33.407 --> 34:34.992
You'll faint outside!

34:57.598 --> 34:59.433
Die, motherfucker. What do I care?

35:55.656 --> 35:57.574
Neel? Neel?

36:16.552 --> 36:18.053
You okay?

36:22.850 --> 36:24.935
What the hell are you doing outside
during daytime?

36:25.269 --> 36:26.854
Do you have a death wish?

36:26.854 --> 36:28.272
My son. Look at me.

36:29.022 --> 36:30.107
Where is your village?

36:30.107 --> 36:32.276
Just ahead. Khella.

36:33.193 --> 36:34.528
Why are you outside during daylight?

36:34.987 --> 36:37.614
The other boys dared me.

36:37.614 --> 36:39.616
I had to.

36:41.201 --> 36:42.536
...fucking kids...

36:51.253 --> 36:53.005
This place is empty.

36:53.589 --> 36:54.756
Where's everyone?

36:55.090 --> 36:57.217
Honk the horn. They sleep underground.

37:06.059 --> 37:07.144
Shahid!

37:07.644 --> 37:09.605
- Shahid. Shahid!
- Shahid?

37:09.605 --> 37:10.731
Is this your kid?

37:11.857 --> 37:12.941
You just let him go out there?

37:13.317 --> 37:14.359
Is he an animal?

37:14.359 --> 37:15.444
Hello, madam!

37:15.444 --> 37:16.612
Hey! He needs help!

37:17.654 --> 37:19.698
He saved the boy's life!

37:20.282 --> 37:21.116
Please, madam.

37:21.742 --> 37:22.910
Bring him in.

37:32.085 --> 37:34.463
Neel, keep your eyes open.

37:35.172 --> 37:37.132
We're almost there,
just a few more minutes.

37:37.132 --> 37:39.009
Keep your eyes open.

37:48.519 --> 37:51.188
This herbal medicine won't do anything.

37:51.188 --> 37:53.023
Gotu kola-- this is best.

37:53.357 --> 37:54.775
Fucking gotu kola...

37:54.775 --> 37:56.026
Is there a proper doctor here, brother?

37:57.486 --> 37:59.863
Look-- even here, life grows!

38:02.366 --> 38:05.327
Listen, you're a scientist,
can't you help?

38:05.327 --> 38:06.495
No, son.

38:10.999 --> 38:12.543
You want the stick?

38:13.460 --> 38:14.461
Okay.

38:20.759 --> 38:22.803
Doctor,
we don't have a lot of time, understand?

38:22.803 --> 38:25.222
Forget about this herbal stuff.
Tell me, what can we do?

38:25.222 --> 38:26.682
We need to cool him down.

38:26.682 --> 38:28.559
I can fucking see that.

38:28.559 --> 38:30.352
- How?
- Ice?

38:31.186 --> 38:32.354
Ice?

38:32.354 --> 38:34.231
But we don't have any.

38:35.482 --> 38:38.443
This village was an offshoot strand
of the Indus River Valley.

38:38.443 --> 38:40.404
Listen, 4,000 years ago,
they grew rice here.

38:40.404 --> 38:41.780
Listen to me.

38:41.780 --> 38:43.782
No matter what happens,
don't let him sleep.

38:43.782 --> 38:46.076
I'm going to the next village
to look for ice.

38:46.660 --> 38:48.161
I'm not gonna let him die here.

38:48.161 --> 38:49.788
Take my number in case you need it.

38:54.168 --> 38:55.127
What the hell?

38:59.298 --> 39:00.549
You're the driver?

39:02.134 --> 39:03.093
You're the driver?

39:04.011 --> 39:05.387
Where are the seeds?

39:13.562 --> 39:14.771
Your tires.

39:21.361 --> 39:24.907
It won't go the way you want.
It never does.

39:36.043 --> 39:39.004
Okay, lady, come out with your hands up!

39:39.004 --> 39:40.923
You don't want it like this. Trust me.

39:43.592 --> 39:44.593
Gaurav!

39:45.761 --> 39:47.554
- Gaurav!
- What?

39:47.554 --> 39:50.265
Get Sardar-ji out of the car!
I've got you covered!

39:53.644 --> 39:54.645
No!

39:55.354 --> 39:57.523
For fuck's sake, just get the old man!

39:57.523 --> 39:58.899
Trust me!

39:58.899 --> 39:59.983
Go!

40:02.945 --> 40:04.446
Engage. Now.

40:20.963 --> 40:22.714
I read the intel on you.

40:23.298 --> 40:24.675
I'm sorry.

40:26.051 --> 40:27.219
He saved my son's life.

40:27.219 --> 40:28.220
Please let him be.

40:28.220 --> 40:32.015
Ma'am, please step away... He's a criminal--

40:32.432 --> 40:35.686
Please. He is already hurt.
Please leave.

40:35.686 --> 40:37.813
Please don't get involved.

40:37.813 --> 40:41.567
Please, ma'am, go! Go inside!
Go take care of your son!

40:41.567 --> 40:42.818
Fuck off! Go!

40:46.280 --> 40:48.198
What the fuck?

41:27.321 --> 41:30.699
Neel... Let's get you to the hospital.
Come on.

41:30.699 --> 41:31.867
- Come on.
- I saved you.

41:31.867 --> 41:32.868
You saved us all.

41:33.410 --> 41:35.579
Lift his leg.

41:36.413 --> 41:37.831
Come. Come, come. Come.

41:39.374 --> 41:40.375
Sweetie.

41:42.252 --> 41:43.170
Keep your eyes open, Neel.

41:43.170 --> 41:44.505
- Sweetie. Sweetie...
- Sweetie.

41:44.505 --> 41:46.089
Sweetie's good... Sweetie's good.

41:46.089 --> 41:47.633
- Come. Sweetie's good.
- Sweetie.

41:47.633 --> 41:49.468
- Sweetie's--
- Sweetie.

41:49.468 --> 41:52.513
Neel. Neel. Neel.

41:55.182 --> 41:56.183
Neel?

43:43.457 --> 43:46.960
Come on... come on.

43:53.175 --> 43:56.512
Come on, diplomatic plates.
Show us your magic.

44:02.601 --> 44:03.685
Let them through.

44:46.395 --> 44:48.689
Neel said they are expecting you inside.

44:57.406 --> 44:58.866
What do I do with this?

44:58.866 --> 45:00.951
Son... There was a boy.

45:00.951 --> 45:03.745
His father had died.
And his mother was old.

45:03.745 --> 45:06.164
They both lived in a village.

45:07.457 --> 45:10.002
<i>They had nothing but an old cow.</i>

45:10.002 --> 45:12.671
