01:38.515 --> 01:41.018
I'm so worried for that boy.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.195
Joe's gonna be okay.

01:44.896 --> 01:47.069
She was everything to him.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.203
Jack's gonna step up. He's a good man.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.031
But he's never had to be a father before.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.877
I don't think he understands Joe.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.165
How long did Elizabeth work there?

02:04.082 --> 02:05.755
- Five years?
- No, I think it was six.

02:06.084 --> 02:09.258
- What do you think was in the coffin?
- Jesus, shut up.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.181
I'm just saying, 'cause of how she died.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.391
You guys weren't wondering that?

02:13.467 --> 02:15.219
No. I'm eating macaroni salad.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.645
I was wondering about that, too.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.639
I heard it crushed her completely.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.358
Steel beam, those things
weigh a ton. Literally.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.185
I don't know how you guys can eat.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.736
Try a turkey roll and you'll discover how.

02:24.811 --> 02:25.812
Lucy, down!

02:26.229 --> 02:27.526
Get down.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.738
Joe? You seen Joe?

02:29.858 --> 02:31.656
Bet Joe's not gonna
want to do my movie anymore.

02:31.902 --> 02:32.903
Why?

02:32.986 --> 02:35.956
Why do you think why?
The story, it's about the living dead.

02:36.031 --> 02:38.910
- His mother's not a zombie.
- But she's dead, shithead.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.119
- These turkey rolls are pretty good.
- Told you.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.990
- I just want to talk to you, Jack.
- Get him out of here.

03:15.070 --> 03:17.949
- Hey, Dainard.
- Would you just wait a minute? Wait!

03:19.950 --> 03:22.578
- Jack! Jack, just let me...
- No.

03:22.661 --> 03:23.662
Get out!

03:24.538 --> 03:25.539
Get out!

03:25.622 --> 03:27.044
Hey, Jack!

03:30.043 --> 03:32.045
- I knew this was a mistake.
- Jack, I...

03:32.129 --> 03:33.346
Jack...

03:45.142 --> 03:46.359
Joseph, I'll be home soon.

04:25.307 --> 04:28.402
Oh, my God.
That was the longest day, ever. Here.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.737
- What's this?
- New scene. Check it out.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.027
Detective Hathaway has a wife now?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.904
I don't know.
I think it might make a better movie.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.030
- I need a better storyline...
- Hey!

04:36.109 --> 04:37.156
...and production value.
- Guys!

04:37.235 --> 04:39.203
Hey, guys.
Martin barfed all over his locker today.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.405
It was the grossest one yet.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.332
- Oh, my God! Shut up!
- I never seen so many colors in my life.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.659
So who's gonna play the wife? Jen?

04:43.742 --> 04:45.710
No way.
I told you what she did with my top hat.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.167
- What wife?
- Alice Dainard.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.633
I was returning that book on
codes and ciphers_

04:51.708 --> 04:53.551
She was in the silent reading section.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.963
And I asked her
if she'd play Hathaway's wife.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.215
Wait.
You talked to Alice Dainard, really?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.346
You're not supposed to talk at all
in the silent reading section.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.893
- Shut up.
- It's for silent reading.

05:01.968 --> 05:05.438
She said "Yes. "
We're filming tonight, and she's driving.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.687
Driving? Driving where?

05:28.411 --> 05:30.630
That was a really good zombie murder.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.424
Yeah, but it's not a story yet.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.384
Older kids are entering this film festival,

05:34.459 --> 05:37.303
15 and 16-year-olds,
who have better stories and

05:38.839 --> 05:41.592
cars and production value.
I've got nothing.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.598
- Charles, dinner!
- I'm coming!

05:44.511 --> 05:48.687
There's this article I want you to read.
It explains everything about stories.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.564
I just don't understand
how the wife helps make it a story.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.236
Jesus, this is what I've been explaining.

05:53.311 --> 05:56.235
That scene we're filming tonight,
where the wife is telling the detective

05:56.314 --> 05:58.191
that she's scared for him,
that she loves him.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.697
I can't believe
you talked to Alice Dainard.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.245
- Charles, come on, move it.
- I'm coming!

06:03.738 --> 06:05.206
And wash your hands this time.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.752
So when he investigates
the zombie stuff, you feel something.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.125
You don't want him to die
because they love each other.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.585
That make sense?

06:12.664 --> 06:14.211
Alice Dainard. That's awesome.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.177
- You're impossible.
- Charles! Now!

06:17.294 --> 06:19.513
God, Mom, I'm coming!

06:20.130 --> 06:22.849
- Midnight, okay? Don't forget.
- I won't forget.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.684
Read this.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.769
It's not fair that I can't go to Wendy's.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.392
Every single person will be there,
except me.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.314
Well, then every single person
can tell you how it was.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.733
Move the puzzle, get the napkins.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.481
- Mom...
- It's your turn to babysit.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.652
Why can't I switch with Charles?

06:34.728 --> 06:36.196
Maybe because you crushed
Charles' top hat.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.238
You ever think of that?

06:37.314 --> 06:38.907
Oh, really? Well, guess what?
We're switching.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.609
Oh, really? 'Cause guess what?
No, we're not.

06:40.692 --> 06:44.322
That's enough. Charles, take this
to the table. Benji, time for dinner!

06:44.613 --> 06:45.614
Hey, Joe.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.244
Night, Mrs. Kaznyk.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.667
Take a seat. We have lots of food.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.119
No, I'm okay. Really. Thank you, though.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.420
- Put them at the table.
- See you tomorrow, Charles.

06:52.495 --> 06:53.496
Later days.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.250
There's always a place
for you here, Joe. You know that.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.425
Stop it!

06:57.500 --> 06:59.252
Yes, sir. Thank you.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.602
Dad?

07:20.857 --> 07:21.949
Dad?

07:22.025 --> 07:25.199
...that possibility with an announcement
that, while it is not likely,

07:25.278 --> 07:28.498
the potential is there
for the ultimate risk of a meltdown

07:28.573 --> 07:31.076
at the Three Mile Island
atomic power plant

07:31.159 --> 07:32.957
outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.289
Robert Schakne reports
from Washington.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.591
According to the government's top...

07:38.667 --> 07:39.668
Hey.

07:40.794 --> 07:41.795
I'll be out in a minute.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.774
It's a six-week program.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.948
Hands-on training with college coaches.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.526
You'd like it. I know I did.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.409
I thought I was gonna have
the summer for myself.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.832
Well, things
have obviously changed for us.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.873
And it'd be good for you
to spend some time

08:14.953 --> 08:17.581
with kids who don't run around
with cameras and monster make-up.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.921
I have to help Charles finish his movie.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.604
I've got nothing against your friends.
I like your friends.

08:41.563 --> 08:44.442
Except for Cary, who can't seem
to stop lighting things on fire.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.112
You'd like it there.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.706
It's what we both need.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.430
But they offered you
no real proof he was alive.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.979
And you didn't.
The decision was made.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.479
- So leave the past alone, Martha.
- I can't.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.741
Well, how much would
a ton of gold be worth today?

09:27.650 --> 09:30.494
Okay, it's time. Don't get caught. Oven

09:32.072 --> 09:33.745
I won't. Over.

09:38.369 --> 09:41.122
You, my little pretty one,
my pretty one

09:41.206 --> 09:44.176
When you gonna give me
some time, Sharona?

09:44.709 --> 09:47.508
Ooh you make my motor run,
my motor run

09:47.629 --> 09:50.098
Wait, so, guys, people are turning
into zombies

09:50.173 --> 09:52.392
because of the chemical factory, right?

09:52.717 --> 09:55.095
I don't see how the guy
playing Detective Hathaway

09:55.178 --> 09:58.182
can ask where the zombies
are coming from. Jesus.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.686
Well, technically,
Hathaway hasn't even...

09:59.766 --> 10:00.858
Shut up.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.441
- Was that a rock?
- I'm sorry, Smartin.

10:04.521 --> 10:07.274
- It was a Twizzler!
- Hey, where'd it go?

10:07.690 --> 10:09.943
Hey, guys, look.
Guys, look! Guys!

10:18.451 --> 10:20.670
- It's okay, Smartin.
- Shut up.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.922
Hey, Alice.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.375
Joe Lamb?

10:25.917 --> 10:26.964
Yeah.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.386
What the hell's he doing here?

10:28.837 --> 10:30.839
Make-up, sound and special effects.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.048
He's the Deputy's kid!

10:32.340 --> 10:33.637
- So what?
- You knew that?

10:33.716 --> 10:36.936
Charles, I don't have a license.
I can't drive with him.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.231
You want Joe to stay back? I guess...

10:40.306 --> 10:42.809
It's too late!
He's seeing me in the car right now!

10:47.147 --> 10:48.194
You can trust me.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.817
My dad will never know.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.824
I won't tell him anything.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.202
Get in.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.500
So, I wrote a couple newlines.
Can I show you?

11:06.749 --> 11:08.001
- What?
- New lines?

11:08.084 --> 11:09.176
Charles, do I have newlines?

11:09.252 --> 11:10.299
Do you know what'd be great?

11:10.378 --> 11:13.052
Is if you could cry during the scene.
Can you do that?

11:13.256 --> 11:14.929
- I'm impressed.
- No.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.010
You know the first place I'm gonna drive
when I get my license?

11:17.093 --> 11:18.845
- Want one?
- New Castle, Pennsylvania.

11:18.928 --> 11:19.929
Fireworks Capital of America.

11:20.013 --> 11:23.643
Wait, so, I don't have newlines, right?
Because I just learned these.

11:35.737 --> 11:38.081
Guys, there's an electrical outlet
up here.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.453
Of anything, why that?

11:39.574 --> 11:41.292
- Charles!
- Got it.

11:41.576 --> 11:44.420
Charles, man, do I have newlines
or not? Oh, no!

11:44.913 --> 11:47.291
Well, you just lost all your newlines,
Martin.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.752
Guys, this is going to be great!

11:52.462 --> 11:54.385
Get the lights and camera set up
on that end,

11:54.464 --> 11:55.681
we'll shoot this direction first.

11:55.798 --> 11:56.799
Joe, get the mike plugged in

11:56.883 --> 11:58.556
and make sure that
the new batteries are in the camera

11:58.635 --> 12:00.478
- before you do the make-up.
- Okay. Okay.

12:01.596 --> 12:04.816
I took apart two packs of cherry bombs
and I made my own M-80.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.143
Do you want to see it?

12:06.601 --> 12:10.105
Your obsession with fireworks,
and I'm saying this as a friend,

12:10.438 --> 12:12.782
concerns me and my mother.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.656
"Sweetheart, this is my job.
I have no choice.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.237
"It's nothing that you need
to worry about.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.414
"What am I supposed to do,
go to Michigan with you?

12:19.489 --> 12:21.787
- "Sweetheart, this is my job. "
- Martin! I wrote a newline.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.745
- What? No.
- What do you mean "no"? It's awesome.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.002
- Okay, so, you know that part when...
- I just finished memorizing this line.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.958
- It's not gonna be hard...
- Do you mind?

12:30.041 --> 12:31.088
- So, you know that part when you say...
- No.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.842
- Well, where'd the other line go?
- It's gone. This one's better.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.343
Here, I'll...

12:36.965 --> 12:40.686
- No, it didn't.
- I've never even had any lines.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.850
- I just needed this one.
- There.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.226
Thanks.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.306
Look, look. Look!

12:45.640 --> 12:46.607
Now I'm not prepared!

12:46.683 --> 12:52.110
Look, it flows better. "Honey, I love you. "
"I love you, too. " See? It flows.

12:52.188 --> 12:55.488
I know, but you keep changing things
and making it more difficult for me.

12:55.566 --> 12:59.662
It's... Martin, it's simple.
"I love you, too. "

12:59.737 --> 13:00.784
It's, like, four words.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.706
My dad works at the mill.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.951
Four words that I don't
have memorized.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.877
Martin. Can you say, "I love you"?

13:13.167 --> 13:14.965
Could you close your eyes, please?

13:15.586 --> 13:16.587
Yeah.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.515
So, the scene is very emotional.

13:23.261 --> 13:26.310
Alice, Mrs. Hathaway really doesn't want
her husband

13:26.389 --> 13:27.481
to keep
investigating these zombie murders.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.730
- Yeah, I know. We read it. We get it.
- You really hate it.

13:30.101 --> 13:31.944
God, I'm just directing.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.860
Martin. Martin, get in position.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.987
You need to reassure her.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.909
Wait. Do you know
what "reassure her" means?

13:39.110 --> 13:40.783
Yeah, I think so.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.072
Okay. We're gonna shoot
on Alice's side first.

13:43.406 --> 13:46.034
Okay, Preston, so,
a few seconds after I say "action,"

13:46.117 --> 13:47.209
I want you to walk over to the pay phone.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.083
You know,
make the place look like it's busy.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.460
- "Hello, hello?"
- I know what that looks like.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.469
Asshole! Could you stop blowing shit up
for two seconds

13:57.545 --> 13:58.546
and deal with the camera?

13:58.921 --> 14:00.093
God. Sorry, man.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.391
Okay, you guys, let's rehearse this.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.471
But remember, save the real
performance for when we're filming.

14:05.762 --> 14:09.266
Here we go. Positions, and action!

14:09.599 --> 14:11.727
So, I'm going to stay here
and investigate.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.274
I think it'd be safer
if you left town for a couple of days.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.949
John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.493
Well, what am I supposed to do,
go to Michigan with you?

14:22.153 --> 14:24.952
Mackinac Island's beautiful
this time of year.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.329
Sweetheart, this is my job.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.336
The dead coming back to life?

14:30.828 --> 14:33.126
- I think you're in danger.
- I have no...

14:34.290 --> 14:36.292
I have no choice.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.294
You do have a choice.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.463
We all do.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.139
John,

14:46.886 --> 14:48.809
I've never asked you to stop.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.983
I've never asked you to give up,
or walk away,

14:53.643 --> 14:55.486
but I'm asking you now.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.739
Please.

14:58.481 --> 14:59.824
For me.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.654
Don't go. Don't leave me.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.334
I need to know this isn't the last time
I'm going to see you.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.505
I just love you so much.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.430
I love you, too.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.184
Was that good?

15:31.222 --> 15:34.567
Yeah. Yeah, that was... That was great.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.744
Production value!

15:46.070 --> 15:48.869
- Cary, you put film in the camera, right?
- I didn't put it in.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.997
What? Put it in, put it in!
Joe, get the mike ready! Go, go, go!

15:52.410 --> 15:54.333
- Get in costume, costume, costume!
- Okay, I will.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.666
Joe, help her! Hurry up!
Martin, get that tripod set up!

15:57.748 --> 16:00.342
- Preston, get in position!
- I will. I have to get the money.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.466
Go! Get these headphones ready!

16:02.628 --> 16:03.800
Martin, you know your lines!

16:03.880 --> 16:06.008
- Hurry! Get that camera ready! Go, go!
- Shut up!

16:06.090 --> 16:07.467
We'll start on Alice and pan
to the train, right?

16:07.550 --> 16:08.847
Oh, God, I hope we don't miss it!

16:13.181 --> 16:14.808
Shut up! I am trying!

16:14.891 --> 16:17.019
Hurry! Get that set up!
Let's go! Positions, positions!

16:17.185 --> 16:20.189
Ready. Start filming.
Be extra loud when the train passes by.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.024
Here we go. And action!

16:23.566 --> 16:26.365
Look, I'm going to stay here
and investigate.

16:26.569 --> 16:30.073
I think it'd be safer
if you left town for a couple of days.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.913
John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.916
What do you want me to do,
go to Michigan with you?

16:36.162 --> 16:38.506
Mackinac Island's beautiful
this time of year.

16:42.168 --> 16:45.843
The dead coming back to life?
I think you're in danger!

16:45.922 --> 16:47.094
I don't have a choice!

16:47.340 --> 16:48.683
You do have a choice!

16:49.008 --> 16:50.100
We all do!

16:53.012 --> 16:55.014
John, I've never asked you to stop!

16:55.598 --> 16:58.602
I've never asked you to give up
or walk away!

16:59.852 --> 17:02.856
But I'm asking you now!
Please, for me,

17:03.606 --> 17:05.529
just don't go!

17:05.608 --> 17:08.612
Just don't go back! Don't leave me!

17:08.944 --> 17:12.369
I need to know this isn't the last time
I'm going to see you!

17:14.075 --> 17:16.328
- I love you so much!
- I love you, too!

17:16.577 --> 17:18.454
- Guys, watch out!
- Joe, what the hell are you...

17:22.333 --> 17:24.631
- Oh, my God!
- Run!

17:26.127 --> 17:27.128
- Oh, my God!
- Go!

17:30.716 --> 17:32.013
Holy shit!

17:32.093 --> 17:33.185
Go, go, go!

17:38.391 --> 17:39.392
Alice!

17:39.475 --> 17:41.569
Joe, let's go! We got to go!

17:44.689 --> 17:46.532
- Keep going!
- Are we alive?

18:09.171 --> 18:10.844
I don't want to die!

18:15.678 --> 18:16.679
Oh, my God!

19:50.398 --> 19:51.399
Guys.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.156
I'm okay.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.116
Martin, you okay?

19:58.114 --> 20:01.334
Though I think I'm having a heart attack.
And I have a scrape.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.789
Joe! Oh, my God!

20:03.077 --> 20:05.626
- Guys, did you see those explosions?
- You guys seen Alice?

20:05.913 --> 20:07.256
That was unbelievable!

20:10.418 --> 20:13.046
- Why did this happen?
- Martin, it's gonna be okay.

20:13.129 --> 20:15.552
No, it's not, dude. Look at this.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.476
Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.105
What's all that blood?

20:34.483 --> 20:37.202
What's the blood?
Did someone get hurt?

20:41.323 --> 20:43.075
- Joe, what are you doing?
- Joe, stop!

20:43.159 --> 20:45.833
- Don't put your hand under there!
- Joe, you don't know what's under there!

20:45.911 --> 20:47.254
Joe!

20:47.538 --> 20:49.211
It's my fake blood!

20:49.498 --> 20:50.841
It's fake.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.675
Guys?

20:56.172 --> 20:57.674
- Come here. What are these things?
- Shit.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.138
No one cares! Look around you!

21:00.217 --> 21:02.060
They look like white Rubik's Cubes,
or something.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.479
I don't think that's what they are.
They don't move.

21:03.554 --> 21:06.808
They're heavy, like metal or something.
There's like a billion of them!

21:06.891 --> 21:08.017
What's going on?

21:08.184 --> 21:10.482
- Martin, it's gonna be okay, all right?
- Are you serious?

21:10.561 --> 21:13.235
You guys! Get up here.
You can see everything from up here!

21:14.648 --> 21:15.740
Joe!

21:31.290 --> 21:32.507
According to my Uncle Seth,

21:32.583 --> 21:35.883
an accident like this
is exceptionally rare.

21:36.045 --> 21:38.218
- It wasn't an accident.
- What?

21:38.422 --> 21:40.720
- There was a truck on the train tracks.
- Are you serious?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.053
What, like, driving on the tracks?

21:44.386 --> 21:45.558
There.

21:52.394 --> 21:53.896
Oh, my gosh.

21:54.605 --> 21:57.233
How could a pickup truck
derail a train, man? That's impossible.

21:57.358 --> 21:58.530
Obviously, it isn't.

21:58.609 --> 21:59.826
Holy shit!

22:02.571 --> 22:05.324
Oh, my God. I know that truck.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.243
Guys.

22:08.577 --> 22:09.794
Is that him?

22:10.246 --> 22:12.248
Yeah. It's him.

22:12.915 --> 22:15.919
- Who?
- It is. Yeah, for sure.

22:16.418 --> 22:17.761
Who is it?

22:21.090 --> 22:22.433
Dr. Woodward.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.101
Dr. Woodward, the science guy?

22:24.301 --> 22:26.770
- Biology.
- Honors Biology.

22:27.054 --> 22:30.274
- Wow. I'm not in his class.
- We know.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.601
Just shut up, Cary.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.445
Remember when Old Man Woodward
took your Electronic Football?

22:38.774 --> 22:41.402
Yeah. He put it in the dungeon
and never gave it back.

22:41.861 --> 22:42.908
The dungeon?

22:43.112 --> 22:45.786
That trailer Woodward keeps
in the school parking lot.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.495
Dr. Woodward?

22:48.617 --> 22:49.960
Dr. Woodward?

23:04.300 --> 23:06.803
"Map of the Contiguous United States. "

23:07.011 --> 23:08.513
What's the writing?

23:08.804 --> 23:09.805
Dates and times.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.686
Guys, what's this line?

23:12.308 --> 23:14.356
It's a schedule for the train.

23:15.728 --> 23:16.900
What the...

23:16.979 --> 23:19.732
He's alive. He's alive!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

23:19.815 --> 23:21.158
Holy shit.

23:29.158 --> 23:30.580
Who are you?

23:31.493 --> 23:33.996
Dr. Woodward, it's me.

23:34.330 --> 23:37.174
Charles Kaznyk. From fourth period.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.798
You've been in an accident.
You're gonna be okay.

23:39.877 --> 23:43.051
- Back!
- Holy shit! Holy shit!

23:45.674 --> 23:47.347
They will kill you.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.935
Do not speak of this.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.266
Or else you

23:56.435 --> 23:58.108
and your parents

23:58.520 --> 23:59.863
will die.

24:03.692 --> 24:04.989
Guys, look.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.870
- We shouldn't be here.
- Oh, my God!

24:06.987 --> 24:08.455
- Go!
- Come on!

24:08.530 --> 24:11.830
- Shit! Let's get the hell out of here!
- Holy shit! Run! Shit!

24:12.326 --> 24:14.499
Guys, there are a lot of nails
on the ground. Be careful.

24:14.578 --> 24:15.921
Hurry, come on, guys!

24:15.996 --> 24:17.839
Guys, come on!

24:18.040 --> 24:19.587
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Holy shit!

24:19.917 --> 24:21.260
Grab the film!

24:23.337 --> 24:24.680
Guys, come on!

24:25.047 --> 24:27.266
Move your ass! Let's go! Let's go!

24:28.425 --> 24:29.972
- Who's got the bags?
- Get in the car!

24:31.845 --> 24:32.846
Get in!

24:33.764 --> 24:35.607
They're getting closer!

24:41.480 --> 24:42.732
Come on!

24:48.570 --> 24:51.414
- Anybody get their plates?
- I didn't get the plate. Did you get it?

24:53.033 --> 24:54.034
All clear.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.964
Holy shit! That was insane!

25:03.085 --> 25:05.338
- He had a gun! An actual physical gun!
- Oh, shit!

25:05.421 --> 25:08.015
My heart is pounding!
That train could've killed us!

25:08.090 --> 25:09.216
Are you okay?

25:09.299 --> 25:11.097
- Oh, shit! My camera's shattered now.
- No.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.520
Guys, I have never had a teacher
aim a gun at me!

25:13.595 --> 25:15.268
It's hard enough to drive
without everyone yelling!

25:15.347 --> 25:16.439
Guys, keep it down.

25:17.641 --> 25:21.020
"You'll die. Your parents will die. "
Guys, this is not good information!

25:21.270 --> 25:23.318
Oh, shit! The focus ring just fell off!

25:23.397 --> 25:24.944
No one cares about your camera!

25:25.024 --> 25:28.369
Guys, am I the only one shaking?
And I'm also crying!

25:28.444 --> 25:31.539
We can't tell anyone we were there.
My dad can't find out I took his car.

25:31.613 --> 25:32.614
Do you guys hear me?

25:32.698 --> 25:35.793
It's okay.
We're not saying anything to anyone.

25:37.703 --> 25:40.297
Guys!
We're not saying anything, are we?

25:40.414 --> 25:42.508
- No.
- No.

25:43.292 --> 25:44.384
See?

25:45.044 --> 25:46.466
No one's going to know.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.468
No one's saying anything.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.021
Joe.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.152
Thanks.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.814
I never should have done this.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.192
Joe. Joe, wake up.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.856
- Make sure you let Lucy out, all right?
- Okay. I will.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.318
What are you gonna do?
You going to be with Charles today?

26:50.400 --> 26:51.777
Yeah. I'll be with Charles.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.988
All right. I'm heading in.
There's something I got to deal with.

26:54.071 --> 26:55.539
- Don't forget to get the yard.
- I will.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.760
Mom, come on!

27:09.044 --> 27:12.048
No! You are not wearing that.
No one in this house is wearing that.

27:12.256 --> 27:14.224
Oh, really?
Compared to Debbie's, these are long.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.300
Listen to your mother.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.228
So, I can't go to Wendy's party
or wear the shorts? Not fair!

27:18.303 --> 27:20.305
Jennifer Anne, "not fair" is Africa.

27:20.722 --> 27:22.065
Mom's racist!

27:22.182 --> 27:24.810
- Do we have any more English muffins?
- Why don't you get up and check.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.112
- Peg, tell the twins to stop.
- I can't, they don't listen.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.905
- Morning, Joe.
- Good morning, Mr. Kaznyk.

27:29.231 --> 27:31.404
Hey, Joe.
Did you hear about the train crash?

27:32.234 --> 27:34.236
- No.
- It's on the news.

27:34.903 --> 27:38.533
...instead opting to use
military personnel,

27:38.615 --> 27:41.869
which for this reporter
only adds to the mystery.

27:41.952 --> 27:45.001
Of course, we'll have much more
on this story as it develops.

27:45.080 --> 27:48.505
Coming to you live from Montgomery
County, Channel 14 News...

27:48.584 --> 27:50.257
Can you believe this?

27:50.419 --> 27:51.591
No.

27:52.129 --> 27:54.473
- It's on the news, that means it's real.
- I know.

27:54.548 --> 27:56.516
Local teacher Thomas Woodward
is still being treated

27:56.592 --> 27:59.812
by Air Force medical personnel
after last night's train derailment.

27:59.928 --> 28:02.681
Woodward apparently fell asleep
at the wheel of his pickup truck,

28:02.764 --> 28:04.232
which was hit by the speeding train.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.060
- This is gross!
- Well, how about you clean it up?

28:06.143 --> 28:08.396
That would be a great help.
Thanks so much.

28:08.478 --> 28:12.108
...derailment, the largest such accident
in Ohio's history.

28:12.441 --> 28:13.442
The condition of Woodward,

28:13.525 --> 28:16.199
who has taught at Lillian Middle School
for the past six years...

28:16.278 --> 28:18.326
Looks like a disaster movie. Doesn't it?

28:20.782 --> 28:22.079
Oh, my God.

28:22.159 --> 28:23.376
Sit down!

28:23.452 --> 28:24.954
Joe, that's awesome.

28:26.038 --> 28:29.292
- What?
- We can use it. We can film it.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.627
You want to go back?

28:31.793 --> 28:33.716
- Holy shit, that's mint.
- Really?

28:33.795 --> 28:34.796
You're a total brain.

28:34.880 --> 28:35.927
We gotta go get the camera fixed

28:36.006 --> 28:37.633
- and the film developed from last night.
- Okay.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.889
I'm gonna go steal some money
from my mom.

28:41.678 --> 28:44.101
If any of the footage is
usable from last night,

28:44.181 --> 28:46.309
that means we need Alice
to play the wife again.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.564
Oh, yeah. I thought she was really good.

28:48.644 --> 28:50.567
Dude, she was mint,
but she's never gonna do it.

28:50.646 --> 28:51.989
I think She will.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.740
There's no way.
You heard what she said.

28:53.815 --> 28:55.442
Well, that was before
the new scenes, right?

28:55.525 --> 28:58.825
You honestly think she cares about
the scenes? She was totally wigged.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.372
Yeah, she was. We all were.

29:00.489 --> 29:04.039
Lens is cracked.
Focus ring broke.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.169
You think it's fixable?

29:06.495 --> 29:07.997
I think it's cheaper to buy a new one.

29:08.330 --> 29:10.207
The camera's busted, man. It's over.

29:10.499 --> 29:11.842
We can use my dad's camera.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.217
- It's got some...
- Hello?

29:13.293 --> 29:16.593
- Hey, Alice. It's Joe Lamb.
- Hi.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.848
So, we have some new scenes
for the movie

29:18.924 --> 29:21.518
and Charles and I were hoping
you'd be in them.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.689
No. No, I'm done with that.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.108
I need this film developed
as soon as possible.

29:28.183 --> 29:29.309
Can you do overnight?

29:29.601 --> 29:31.649
Asshole, no one can do overnight.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.649
You want to buy some pot?

29:35.607 --> 29:37.951
No. No, thank you.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.279
Well, what's the fastest you can do?

29:40.362 --> 29:44.037
I can make it a rush.
You'll get your film back in three days.

29:44.616 --> 29:48.041
Hey, what's your sister up to?
The hot one, not the other one.

29:48.787 --> 29:49.788
I don't know.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.798
I'm watching the crash on the news.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.713
- Yeah. I saw it.
- I should go.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.466
Wait. Hold on. Let me come over
and I'll bring the scenes...

29:56.545 --> 29:59.298
- No, no. Don't. Don't come...
- I'll be right there. It's a good idea.

29:59.464 --> 30:02.308
I don't care what Charles wants.
I said no on the phone.

30:02.384 --> 30:04.478
You totally did, I know that's true, but...

30:04.553 --> 30:06.430
But now you're at my house.

30:06.722 --> 30:07.769
I am. Which...

30:07.889 --> 30:10.608
I don't understand how you guys can
keep working on that stupid movie.

30:13.478 --> 30:14.900
You should go.

30:26.366 --> 30:27.709
What's this?

30:29.202 --> 30:31.204
He was just inviting me to a party.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.007
- Yeah?
- Good morning, Mr. Dainard.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.178
She's not going to your party.

30:38.712 --> 30:39.759
Yes, Sir.

30:48.221 --> 30:50.223
You. Get out of here.

30:50.766 --> 30:53.189
You go home and
you don't come back here!

30:55.604 --> 30:57.151
I don't want to see you.

30:59.649 --> 31:00.650
Ally, come inside!

31:07.949 --> 31:09.826
Ally, I'm in the kitchen.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.131
I'll do it.

31:17.959 --> 31:18.960
What?

31:25.050 --> 31:26.723
Cut! That was mint!

31:27.552 --> 31:30.852
Oh, my God. With the train...
So good!

31:30.931 --> 31:32.478
- Joe, reload the cap gun.
- Okay.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.980
We'll shoot another angle next.
Alice, that was mint.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.858
Martin, go a little faster next time.

31:37.229 --> 31:40.654
I'll try, Charles, but I'm still crying about
last night, man. I feel like I'm crazy.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.989
Guys, did it really look good?
My death?

31:43.068 --> 31:45.162
- Dude, it looked awesome.
- That was magic.

31:45.862 --> 31:47.660
What do you think happened?

31:48.782 --> 31:50.455
You mean why he crashed the train?

31:51.952 --> 31:53.795
I just got a horrible feeling.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.671
Dude, what are you doing?

32:14.516 --> 32:16.610
That whole thing's an Air Force train.

32:16.977 --> 32:17.978
What?

32:18.353 --> 32:21.482
I make models. Like, plastic ones.
You know, glue them, paint them...

32:21.565 --> 32:24.364
- And he's not embarrassed by that.
- Look who's talking, Math Camp!

32:24.443 --> 32:26.616
Thanks. Can I have a coffee, please?
Cream on the side.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.038
- Sure.
- He's so sophisticated.

32:28.113 --> 32:30.536
- Shut up. I like coffee.
- No one likes coffee.

32:30.615 --> 32:33.368
Air Force trains, even the models,
have these hooks...

32:33.452 --> 32:36.296
They do! For when the trains are
loaded on the transport ships.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.964
Every car in that crash had hooks.

32:38.039 --> 32:39.837
Joe, would you stop
talking about it, all right?

32:39.916 --> 32:40.963
Wait, guys.

32:41.042 --> 32:43.465
Am I the only one who doesn't
understand what any of this means?

32:43.545 --> 32:44.717
- Probably, Smartin.
- Cary, shut up.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.340
- You shut up.
- I don't like it when you call me that.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.050
I'm sorry, Smartin.
Let's just go cry about it.

32:48.300 --> 32:52.726
Dr. Woodward had that map.
He drove onto the train tracks.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.057
Maybe there was something
he wanted to...

32:55.182 --> 32:57.310
- To destroy, yeah!
- My God, will you guys just shut up?

32:57.392 --> 32:59.736
Maybe he was just sick of being old
and wanted to kill himself.

32:59.811 --> 33:00.983
That's a dumb idea.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.314
He had a gun. Why not use that?

33:02.397 --> 33:06.618
There are infinitely more effective ways
to commit suicide. Pills, hanging...

33:06.818 --> 33:08.741
Pussy! Stop taking the fries away.

33:08.945 --> 33:10.868
- I ordered these for a reason.
- Excuse me.

33:10.947 --> 33:13.450
Could we get another order of fries?
Because my friend here is fat.

33:13.533 --> 33:16.582
Funny, chompers. At least I don't have
to use a booster seat.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.372
You could jump from a building.

33:18.580 --> 33:21.049
- Or fall down some stairs.
- Well, that's not really effective.

33:21.291 --> 33:24.010
If it's the Air Force, what would
the Air Force have on the train?

33:24.085 --> 33:25.587
Jesus, shut up about it.

33:26.379 --> 33:29.383
You heard what Old Man Woodward
said, we can't talk about this.

33:29.633 --> 33:32.102
Joe, seriously.
Do you really wanna take a chance

33:32.177 --> 33:33.850
that something could happen
to your dad, too?

33:42.854 --> 33:44.401
All right, easy, easy!

33:49.110 --> 33:50.953
- It's loaded. Move out.
- Yes, sir.

33:54.407 --> 33:57.707
Yes, Deputy. I'm told this crash has
caused a whole mess of confusion.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.413
Well, as you can expect,
the local authorities

33:59.496 --> 34:01.965
are trying to figure out just what
happened, as well as how to help you.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.293
It's all under control.
It'll be a very fast clean-up.

34:04.417 --> 34:06.169
Colonel, there isn't anything
that I should know, is there?

34:06.294 --> 34:08.217
Not that I can think of, Deputy.

34:08.295 --> 34:10.514
I understand you have concerns
about our cargo.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.350
Well, I'd like to see that manifest, yes.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.136
Well, that's not gonna be possible.

34:14.302 --> 34:15.804
Colonel, I've got a lot of people
in my town

34:15.887 --> 34:17.730
that are gonna wanna know
what's taking place.

34:18.223 --> 34:19.520
Which town is that?

34:19.599 --> 34:20.690
Lillian.

34:22.686 --> 34:24.654
Deputy, if you're asking me if we had
any dangerous properly

34:24.728 --> 34:27.733
on board this train,
I can assure you the answer is "No. "

34:28.233 --> 34:29.234
Colonel!

34:29.609 --> 34:30.701
Excuse me.

34:42.121 --> 34:43.214
They gave me the runaround
for two hours

34:43.290 --> 34:44.667
before they allowed me
to talk to anyone.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.672
I'd say they've had their hands full, Jack.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.879
Nelec, the Colonel, refused to
show me the manifest.

34:48.962 --> 34:51.715
He told me they're carrying mostly
airplane parts. I don't buy that.

34:51.797 --> 34:54.641
It's Air Force, Jack.
Airplane parts sort of make sense.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.145
Sheriff, I'm telling you,
there's something else going on.

34:57.220 --> 35:00.815
They're taking molds of tire tracks.
Why would they be doing that?

35:00.890 --> 35:02.107
Who would they be looking for?

35:02.183 --> 35:04.857
And they're packaging these
weird little cubes into these crates.

35:04.978 --> 35:05.945
Weird little cubes?

35:06.021 --> 35:09.116
Yeah, they're loading them onto these
red trucks. There are dozens of them.

35:09.190 --> 35:11.158
Sheriff, I think you need to go
check it out.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.702
And I think you need to take a break.

35:13.695 --> 35:15.914
Jack, I've been telling you this
since Elizabeth.

35:15.989 --> 35:18.367
You're a good deputy,
but you need to take a vacation.

35:19.075 --> 35:23.080
Go home. Take off the uniform.
Go fishing. Give your son a hug.

35:38.345 --> 35:41.690
Hey, Breen, I'm not sure Edie's
paying you to listen to the radio.

35:43.725 --> 35:44.726
Breen!

35:45.894 --> 35:47.237
Hey, Sheriff.

35:47.395 --> 35:48.487
What's that?

35:48.730 --> 35:52.360
Walkman. It's like a stereo.
Play your own cassette tapes.

35:52.692 --> 35:53.693
You want to try?

35:53.818 --> 35:55.491
I don't think so.

35:55.570 --> 35:58.574
Kids walking around with their
own stereos, just what we need.

35:59.366 --> 36:00.743
It's a slippery slope, my friend.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.502
Yes, Sir.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.138
Sheriff?

37:50.727 --> 37:51.979
Sheriff?

38:43.571 --> 38:45.744
You know, in scene... Where is it?

38:46.908 --> 38:48.251
Where'd you learn to do this?

38:48.576 --> 38:50.249
Mostly the Dick Smith
Monster Make-up Handbook.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.797
Hey, Joe. We need some more
footage of the train crash.

38:52.872 --> 38:53.919
Obviously.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.500
You know that train model
you just made?

38:55.583 --> 38:57.711
- Your cargo train.
- I want to blow it up and film it.

38:57.919 --> 38:59.592
Let me blow it up.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.261
Yeah. Sure.

39:02.549 --> 39:03.766
- Mint!
- Gnarly! Yes!

39:05.385 --> 39:06.386
Here, take this, will you?

39:08.263 --> 39:12.234
It's fine. They can blow it up.
I don't care.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.362
You want to see it? The train?

39:16.604 --> 39:18.948
My train model? The train I made?

39:21.234 --> 39:22.235
Dude, that's bitching.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.695
Dude, that's like the third time
it's happened.

39:23.778 --> 39:24.825
What the hell?

39:24.904 --> 39:27.077
So how am I supposed to be a zombie?

39:30.618 --> 39:34.293
Pretty much just be a lifeless ghoul,
with no soul. Dead eyes.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.250
Scary. Did you ever have Mrs. Mullin?

39:37.458 --> 39:39.131
- For English? Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:39.335 --> 39:41.758
Kind of like her,
but hungry for human flesh.

39:41.963 --> 39:44.136
Like she wants to turn
somebody into a zombie.

39:44.299 --> 39:46.176
'Cause that's Kind of what zombies do.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.908
Oh, my God, yeah. That's really good.

40:20.543 --> 40:21.886
Not bad.

40:22.045 --> 40:23.888
- Really?
- Really.

40:33.598 --> 40:38.274
Careful! There was a gas spill.
I don't even know how much fuel I lost.

40:38.353 --> 40:40.230
You don't seem to be asking
very many questions.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.031
Give the man some time, Mr. Blakely.

40:42.190 --> 40:44.659
- He's only a deputy, he's not the Sheriff.
- Doesn't matter.

40:45.193 --> 40:48.197
I think this is most likely a bear attack.

40:48.321 --> 40:50.995
Security cameras showed nothing.
Someone had erased...

40:51.074 --> 40:53.247
Vicky, you heard
from Sheriff Pruitt this morning?

40:53.326 --> 40:55.169
Negative. Still no word.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.423
Vicky, you need to have Dayton
send a C.S. Unit out to Edie's,

41:02.502 --> 41:04.721
and you put an A.P.B. Out on the Sheriff
and Breen Haskell,

41:04.796 --> 41:07.595
and send units over to their houses
immediately. You copy all that?

41:07.674 --> 41:12.054
Copy. And, Jack,
we 're getting a lot of unusual calls.

41:12.512 --> 41:14.059
What kinds of unusual calls?

41:14.639 --> 41:16.357
I've never seen this kind of thing before.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.059
I mean,
what the hell am I supposed to do?

41:18.142 --> 41:21.362
The insurance company guy
thought I was joking with him.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.405
Look at my Bonneville over here!

41:23.523 --> 41:25.321
They'd have to have
a winch to take that out.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.619
You been having any
troubles with anyone lately, Izzy?

41:28.111 --> 41:30.614
Well, I was thinking
you should talk to Louis Dainard.

41:31.322 --> 41:34.451
Yeah. I didn't help him out
with financing last year,

41:34.534 --> 41:38.084
and I wouldn't be surprised if this was
some sort of sick retribution.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.711
- My generator is missing.
- The phones aren't working.

41:40.790 --> 41:43.589
- My dog's gone. Disappeared.
- The phones won't produce a signal.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.045
Call the station and file a report.

41:45.128 --> 41:47.756
I'll have someone come out
and take care of each one of you. Okay?

42:08.443 --> 42:10.116
Lucy!

42:12.864 --> 42:14.457
Lucy!

42:43.478 --> 42:45.196
I got four guys on this case...

42:45.271 --> 42:47.740
People don't feel safe around here.
You know why? Because they're not.

42:47.815 --> 42:48.907
We need to get the National Guard...

42:48.983 --> 42:50.405
Air Force hasn't
answered a damn question.

42:50.485 --> 42:52.237
They've got trucks over at
Woodward's house.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.118
Now, Ben heard they were looking
for Woodward's research.

42:54.197 --> 42:55.198
Research? What the hell?

42:55.281 --> 42:57.375
...shotgun in one of those trucks,
he had, like, a scanner in his hand.

42:57.450 --> 42:58.417
Like a Geiger counter.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.211
They're saying it's just clean up
at the crash site, too,

43:00.286 --> 43:01.959
but they're taking molds of tire tracks.

43:02.038 --> 43:04.632
That means they're looking for
someone. Now what does that mean?

43:08.711 --> 43:10.213
Have you seen Lucy anywhere?

43:10.963 --> 43:12.965
No. I'm sure
she's around somewhere.

43:13.049 --> 43:15.177
I put a couple of slices
in the fridge for you there.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.103
I ate those.

43:18.179 --> 43:20.602
- Sorry, kid.
- Yeah, no problem. I'll find something.

43:20.681 --> 43:22.024
- Hey!
- You got to be kidding.

43:24.852 --> 43:26.195
Pick that up, will you?

43:28.731 --> 43:30.574
Hey, Vicky,
you got power down at the station?

43:30.650 --> 43:32.448
On and off
And Brook County's in the dark.

43:32.527 --> 43:35.155
Do me a favor and get Water & Power
out there right now, will you?

43:35.363 --> 43:38.333
So, the Air Force is looking for a car.
Alice's dad's car.

43:38.533 --> 43:41.286
They're taking tire prints
from the crash site. Over.

43:41.369 --> 43:42.666
I don't want to hear about it.

43:42.745 --> 43:45.715
This is what I've been talking about.
They could be monitoring us right now.

43:45.832 --> 43:48.711
Jesus, shut up. Over.

43:48.918 --> 43:51.762
And the military is at Woodward's house
looking for his research.

43:51.838 --> 43:53.090
Whatever that means.

43:53.172 --> 43:54.640
You cannot flake out on me
and be a dick.

43:54.715 --> 43:56.558
Are you gonna come and
help me tomorrow or not?

43:56.759 --> 43:58.682
I need you to make Alice
a zombie again.

43:58.761 --> 44:00.388
Okay. I'll do the make-up.

44:01.139 --> 44:02.311
Oven

44:06.435 --> 44:09.314
The cables are gone-
All the poles are empty.

44:09.438 --> 44:13.443
Same thing over here in Rose Hill.
Somebody took the damn wires down.

44:13.526 --> 44:15.119
Holy shit!

44:15.403 --> 44:17.622
Hey, Rooney,
you got anything in Lillian?

44:17.697 --> 44:19.199
Hey, Rooney, you copy?

44:19.323 --> 44:21.291
We got a half mile of copper missing.

44:21.784 --> 44:23.331
Lines are back up at M-38.

44:23.661 --> 44:27.586
Truck 14, Rooney's out at the junkyard.
I'll give you an update when I hear back.

45:40.321 --> 45:41.914
I wanna know who took them.

45:42.323 --> 45:44.041
Twenty microwaves

45:44.450 --> 45:46.544
gone from my inventory.

45:46.869 --> 45:48.837
Everywhere you look,
things are going missing.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.629
We've got trains crashing,
people vanishing.

45:51.707 --> 45:53.835
Belmont County's without power.

45:54.001 --> 45:57.505
You know what this feels like to me?
This feels like a Russian invasion.

45:59.799 --> 46:01.972
Debbie, I don't think that the Russians
have anything to do

46:02.051 --> 46:03.678
with what's going on in town.

46:03.761 --> 46:05.934
But I am calling the curfew because
of these exact concerns.

46:06.013 --> 46:08.607
Unless you can tell me who's been
messing around with our stuff,

46:08.683 --> 46:10.185
I say it's the Soviets.

46:11.185 --> 46:14.314
I like you, Jack,
but we need Sheriff Pruitt back.

46:15.106 --> 46:17.529
We've got good people working on that.

46:18.150 --> 46:19.276
Mr. McCandless.

46:23.364 --> 46:26.664
Since Wednesday morning,
my ham radio is a mess!

46:26.867 --> 46:28.915
Some frequencies which I like to scan,

46:29.620 --> 46:33.466
I'm hearing military chatter,
but it's distorted.

46:33.541 --> 46:35.543
And I don't know what it is.
Have you heard that?

46:35.626 --> 46:37.924
Mr. McCandless, can I have a word
with you in private, please?

46:38.379 --> 46:40.552
It was like having my radio hijacked.

46:40.881 --> 46:41.928
I'm sure that must be very annoying.

46:42.008 --> 46:43.635
You don't know those frequencies
offhand, do you?

46:43.718 --> 46:45.891
Sure I do. 13-2-0-1...

46:46.929 --> 46:48.602
Patty, why don't you get
in touch with Vicky.

46:48.681 --> 46:49.898
Hey, Dave, you seen Milner?

46:49.974 --> 46:51.066
No, sir. I haven't.

46:51.142 --> 46:52.485
Jack, there's a huge sinkhole
by my garage!

46:52.560 --> 46:53.732
- It sunk almost a foot!
- I'll take care of that.

46:53.811 --> 46:56.655
Hey, Tom. Tom! You seen Milner?

46:56.772 --> 46:58.615
Have you tried his office?

46:59.108 --> 47:00.451
Have I tried his office?

47:00.735 --> 47:02.863
What are you gonna do about the
power? It's been out for two days.

47:04.113 --> 47:05.456
Hey, Rosko.

47:06.282 --> 47:08.125
Rosko. I need you to get
every radio we have

47:08.200 --> 47:09.201
and you tune them to those frequencies.

47:09.285 --> 47:10.332
- Understand?
- No.

47:10.411 --> 47:11.412
- Hey, Milner.
- Yeah.

47:11.495 --> 47:13.543
Don't you have a radio scanner
with a descrambler?

47:13.622 --> 47:15.124
- A voice inverter, yeah, at home.
- Whatever. Get it.

47:15.207 --> 47:16.834
Bring it down here and set it up for me.
Would you please?

47:16.917 --> 47:18.009
- Sure thing.
- Jack, what is this?

47:18.085 --> 47:20.258
I think the Air Force is using
unassigned channels...

47:20.338 --> 47:23.217
Hey. He was at my house
yesterday morning. You aware of that?

47:23.299 --> 47:25.267
We brought him in for the car lot
and other stuff. He's clean.

47:25.343 --> 47:29.189
Well, I'd appreciate it if you'd inform
your son that my house is off-limits.

47:29.764 --> 47:31.766
And so is my daughter.

47:36.020 --> 47:38.364
I think the make-up
was better yesterday.

47:38.814 --> 47:40.316
No, it's good.

47:41.317 --> 47:42.614
I think it looks good.

47:44.111 --> 47:45.283
I should've cleaned up my room.

47:50.284 --> 47:52.207
Did you make all these models?

47:53.120 --> 47:57.796
Yeah. That one is
the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

47:58.167 --> 48:00.670
We watched that one on TV.

48:08.052 --> 48:10.896
This is the train they want to destroy.

48:11.806 --> 48:13.023
Looks real.

48:14.308 --> 48:15.981
It looks so old.

48:16.394 --> 48:18.396
Yeah, that's dry brush technique.

48:20.481 --> 48:23.655
It's when there's a coat of paint
and then you put something

48:23.734 --> 48:25.611
like Euro Gray over it.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.079
Euro Gray?

48:27.405 --> 48:30.784
Oh, my God, there's like
14 different grays. It gets crazy.

48:37.248 --> 48:39.000
What was that necklace?

48:39.333 --> 48:42.086
The one you were holding
at the train crash.

48:42.169 --> 48:43.216
Was it your mom's?

48:46.674 --> 48:49.097
My dad gave it to her the day I was born.

48:50.094 --> 48:51.471
She wears it all the time.

48:52.179 --> 48:53.681
Well, used to.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.057
And...

48:58.352 --> 49:00.855
It was bad how she died and...

49:01.522 --> 49:03.069
But my dad got it back.

49:07.361 --> 49:09.363
Guys, what the hell?
No one knew where you were!

49:09.697 --> 49:10.744
We're here.

49:10.865 --> 49:13.368
- You got to play the soldier.
- I thought you were calling Evan.

49:13.617 --> 49:15.210
Evan blew us off. He's a pussy!

49:17.121 --> 49:18.293
Excuse me.

49:18.372 --> 49:19.464
It's okay.

49:19.540 --> 49:21.338
You got to do it. You're the only one.

49:21.417 --> 49:23.294
Well, what the hell you mean they found
my dog in Brookville?

49:23.377 --> 49:24.674
That's another county over!

49:25.212 --> 49:27.840
Lucy. That's where she is.
I mean, we've got nearly 30 calls

49:27.923 --> 49:29.175
from people who found local dogs,

49:29.258 --> 49:31.602
but the thing is
the calls coming in aren't local.

49:33.888 --> 49:37.643
It's like they all just ran away
in every direction.

49:38.476 --> 49:40.729
This isn't like her,
she just doesn't disappear.

49:40.853 --> 49:43.151
Okay, okay, calm down.
Just tell me what she looks like.

49:43.230 --> 49:45.733
She's got dark hair. It was in rollers.
Do you know what rollers are?

49:45.858 --> 49:47.656
- Yes, I know what rollers are.
- Okay, so...

49:47.735 --> 49:48.861
Hang on.

49:50.070 --> 49:52.414
Negative, unable to recover data.

49:52.823 --> 49:53.995
That's definitely Air Force.

49:54.241 --> 49:55.663
Yeah, it's Air Force,
but what does it mean?

49:55.743 --> 49:58.166
What are they doing transmitting
on these frequencies?

49:58.245 --> 50:00.839
- Maybe it's not even Air Force.
- I bet you five bucks it's Air Force.

50:00.915 --> 50:02.167
- Five bucks?
- Yeah.

50:02.249 --> 50:05.423
We're gonna need units to prepare for
Operation Walking Distance.

50:05.753 --> 50:07.096
What did he say? "Operation" what?

50:07.379 --> 50:08.756
"Walking Distance. "

50:09.632 --> 50:10.679
What's this?

50:10.758 --> 50:12.726
He worked at Romero Chemical.

50:12.801 --> 50:14.769
Found out some things
the company was doing.

50:14.929 --> 50:18.274
And after what you told me last night
at the bar, I thought you should know.

50:19.683 --> 50:21.526
Are we gonna get in trouble
for being here?

50:21.602 --> 50:22.774
Production value.

50:22.853 --> 50:25.527
Stop talking about production value.
I think the Air Force is gonna kill us.

50:25.606 --> 50:27.404
- Cary.
- Don't cover my mouth!

50:27.483 --> 50:30.407
We just made this discovery today.
You understand this is top secret?

50:30.486 --> 50:31.533
Of course.

50:31.612 --> 50:33.410
I would never have given you
this information

50:33.489 --> 50:35.116
unless we had worked
together in Vietnam.

50:35.282 --> 50:37.501
- Those were hard times.
- I'd rather not talk about it.

50:37.660 --> 50:38.661
Understood.

50:39.328 --> 50:41.001
- You're a good friend.
- You, too.

50:42.164 --> 50:43.507
Nothing so far.

50:43.832 --> 50:46.802
- How much more is there?
- About 60 more boxes in the basement.

50:47.127 --> 50:48.800
What, more tax returns?

50:49.129 --> 50:53.305
It's here somewhere. We'll find it. If not,
Woodward will tell us where it is.

50:53.634 --> 50:55.102
What the hell is that?

51:00.140 --> 51:01.141
Joe.

51:02.268 --> 51:03.690
Hey, Mr. Lamb.

51:04.979 --> 51:06.276
Get in the car.

51:11.944 --> 51:15.994
Mr. Lamb, that's your camera,
but, technically, that's my film.

51:22.955 --> 51:23.956
What the hell?

51:25.124 --> 51:26.341
Is it me?

51:26.417 --> 51:28.044
I would like to help you out, Deputy,
I really would,

51:28.335 --> 51:30.133
but we operate on
a need-to-know basis.

51:30.212 --> 51:31.509
Why are your trucks sweeping the town?

51:31.589 --> 51:32.966
We will be out of your way shortly.

51:33.048 --> 51:36.018
All right, then I'm sure
you won't mind me contacting D.C.

51:36.260 --> 51:38.228
Talk to some friends about
"Walking Distance. "

51:41.724 --> 51:43.021
All right, we'll do it that way.

51:44.018 --> 51:46.191
Deputy! Let's talk.

51:46.687 --> 51:48.030
Just not here.

51:58.157 --> 52:00.831
This is new, all of this,
for the both of us.

52:01.619 --> 52:04.122
Dealing with anything. Just us.

52:04.330 --> 52:07.834
So, I'm gonna make this
as simple and as clear as I can.

52:08.083 --> 52:09.835
You're not friends with Alice Dainard.

52:10.169 --> 52:14.345
When I say "No," I don't mean "Maybe. "
I don't mean "Yes. "

52:14.798 --> 52:16.015
I mean "No. "

52:16.383 --> 52:20.183
I've known Louis Dainard for a lot
of years. He's been nothing but trouble.

52:20.596 --> 52:23.019
Your mother used to say he's
not such a bad guy.

52:23.098 --> 52:25.066
He just needs a chance,
that he was sad.

52:25.517 --> 52:26.734
Well, I tried to be good to him.

52:27.102 --> 52:28.729
And I can't, not anymore.

52:30.314 --> 52:32.942
I will not allow him
or his daughter in this house.

52:33.025 --> 52:35.153
I will not allow you to
spend time with her,

52:35.235 --> 52:38.205
doing projects or whatever it is
that you do. That's it.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.953
I hope we're clear on that.

52:42.326 --> 52:43.919
We're not clear.

52:45.037 --> 52:46.004
What'd you say?

52:46.080 --> 52:47.081
We're not clear.

52:47.164 --> 52:50.384
You and I aren't clear about anything.
We couldn't be less clear.

52:50.501 --> 52:54.756
Just because Mom died doesn't mean
you know anything about me. You don't.

52:54.922 --> 52:57.846
You don't know anything about
Alice, either. She's kind.

52:57.925 --> 52:59.051
We're not gonna have this discussion
right now.

52:59.134 --> 53:01.307
- She's nice to me!
- I don't care what she is!

53:02.930 --> 53:05.479
Her father is an irresponsible,
selfish son of a bitch.

53:06.850 --> 53:09.103
You listen to me.
I've got 12,000 people in this town

53:09.186 --> 53:12.861
who are scared out of their mind.
They've got one person to rely on.

53:13.107 --> 53:15.701
It used to be someone else,
but now it's just me.

54:56.460 --> 54:57.461
Move, move!

54:57.669 --> 54:58.670
Let's go. Move!

54:58.754 --> 55:01.473
Deputy, drop your weapons.
Put your hands on the car

55:01.548 --> 55:02.925
I'm here to see Colonel Nelec!

55:03.050 --> 55:05.052
He told me to meet him here.

55:05.219 --> 55:07.392
You're under military arrest.
Drop your weapons.

55:07.763 --> 55:09.390
Where's Nelec?

55:11.558 --> 55:14.186
I don't want any more trouble, do you?

55:17.898 --> 55:21.368
We've been going through your
belongings, looking for evidence.

55:21.443 --> 55:25.368
What you knew. How you knew it.
Who else might know.

55:34.456 --> 55:36.083
I remember you in the lab.

55:36.416 --> 55:38.293
And I recall we didn't always see
eye to eye,

55:38.377 --> 55:41.096
but that is no excuse
for doing what you did here.

55:41.713 --> 55:46.059
So, in the spirit of moving forward
and avoiding more trouble,

55:46.134 --> 55:48.762
why don't you just tell me
where you put your research

55:48.846 --> 55:50.189
and who else knows about it.

55:50.472 --> 55:53.567
I know you had someone document
the crash that night.

55:53.725 --> 55:55.773
Tell me who that was
and I will help you.

55:56.395 --> 55:57.897
I swear to God on my mother's life,

55:57.980 --> 56:00.950
if you help us now,
we will take care of you.

56:03.110 --> 56:05.989
I've seen what happens, Mr. Nelec,

56:07.823 --> 56:10.121
- when you take care of people.
- It is mine.

56:10.200 --> 56:11.702
He is mine.

56:12.327 --> 56:14.750
I'm gonna bait him and catch him.

56:15.163 --> 56:17.962
He's in me, you know.

56:20.627 --> 56:22.300
As I am in him.

56:23.171 --> 56:24.388
So,

56:26.133 --> 56:27.476
when you see him next,

56:28.552 --> 56:30.554
as I'm sure you will,

56:31.430 --> 56:33.478
I'll be watching you, too.

57:18.060 --> 57:20.404
Are you... Were you sleeping?

57:20.771 --> 57:23.524
Before. Earlier. No.

57:25.275 --> 57:26.572
Are you okay?

57:26.652 --> 57:28.199
Yeah, I'm fine.

57:30.280 --> 57:31.281
You want to come in?

57:31.365 --> 57:32.537
Yeah.

57:40.332 --> 57:41.549
Power's still out.

57:43.627 --> 57:45.129
Room's still messy.

57:45.212 --> 57:46.555
I couldn't sleep.

57:47.422 --> 57:48.969
I was thinking.

57:50.467 --> 57:53.061
I wanted to tell you something
before tomorrow.

57:54.846 --> 57:56.848
Don't let Charles blow up your train.

57:59.059 --> 58:00.777
I don't think it's right.

58:01.895 --> 58:04.865
I know he's your friend.
He's so bossy.

58:04.940 --> 58:07.784
But I've known him since kindergarten.
He's really nice.

58:07.859 --> 58:10.487
He shouldn't always get what he wants.

58:10.904 --> 58:13.282
I mean, who always gets
what they want?

58:16.743 --> 58:19.087
I know I don't know you at all.

58:19.579 --> 58:22.423
Even though it sort of feels like I do.

58:27.254 --> 58:30.554
Do you not feel like that?

58:30.924 --> 58:32.722
No. No, I totally do.

58:33.260 --> 58:36.514
I'm just kind of in shock
at this entire conversation.

58:40.767 --> 58:41.859
Power's back.

58:41.935 --> 58:43.562
No, no. Keep it.

59:27.522 --> 59:29.320
It's... it's so weird.

59:30.984 --> 59:34.363
Watching her like this.
Like she's still here.

59:38.992 --> 59:44.670
She used to look at me this way,
like really look,

59:48.502 --> 59:52.473
and I just knew I was there,
that I existed.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.863
He drank that morning.

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:11.365
My dad.

01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:16.659
He missed his shift.

01:00:26.498 --> 01:00:28.500
Your mom took it for him,

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:30.589
the day of the accident.

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:53.066
He...

01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:56.118
He...

01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:58.363
He... He wishes...

01:01:00.115 --> 01:01:02.959
I know he wishes it was him
instead of her.

01:01:08.123 --> 01:01:10.091
And sometimes I do, too.

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:16.180
Don't say that.

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:20.218
He's your dad.

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:44.288
Is... Is this normal?

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:47.996
No. This is new.

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.766
Want to tell me where you were?

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.225
Or should I tell you?

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:55.696
Sit down.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:58.195
I should go to bed.

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:00.201
I want to talk to you. I said sit down.

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:01.824
I don't want to sit down!

01:03:03.697 --> 01:03:04.949
Then go.

01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:08.368
Be just like your mother and leave.

01:03:10.036 --> 01:03:11.208
Dad...

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:12.922
Go ahead! Go!

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.042
Go!

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:23.717
Alice!

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:25.306
Alice!

01:03:25.677 --> 01:03:26.849
Alice!

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:28.972
Wait!

01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:54.123
Ally, I'm sorry!

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:25.950
Alice!

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:29.245
Ally!

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:34.959
Alice!

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:36.414
Ally!

01:04:45.757 --> 01:04:46.849
Ally!

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:53.432
Firelight at 0500 hours.

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:56.309
Operation Walking Distance is in effect.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:59.237
T- minus four hours to evacuation.

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:01.940
Evacuation in T-minus four hours.

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:05.243
Why are you not reacting?
That thing went through my wall!

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:06.615
I told you not to pick it up
in the first place.

01:05:06.694 --> 01:05:09.243
What are you so angry about? That I'm
not gonna let you blow up my train?

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:11.745
That's part of it. Just a part.

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:16.292
Hey. Tell your sister that Donny
from Olsen's broke up with Karen.

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:19.086
That shit ended about a week ago.

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:22.419
What's your problem?

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:24.971
My whole movie's a disaster
because of you.

01:05:25.046 --> 01:05:27.890
- I know my dad's being a turkey.
- Whatever.

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:31.849
- We're still gonna finish your movie.
- It's not about the movie.

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:33.521
What are you talking about?
Of course it is!

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:34.848
Just forget it.

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:38.481
Why? There's nothing wrong!
We're gonna finish the movie!

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.289
I can get the camera back.
I know where my dad put it.

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:56.915
We can still make the festival.

01:05:56.995 --> 01:05:58.963
- It's not about the movie.
- Then what is it about?

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:01.132
Jesus, you don't get it, do you?
It's obvious.

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:03.130
- What's obvious?
- God, you're a dumbass.

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:05.211
That night of the crash,
you started getting all weird.

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:08.014
- What? What are you talking about?
- Like Mr. Attitude, all of a sudden.

01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:10.968
Your movie was over!
That's what you said! You were upset!

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:12.927
- Oh, my God.
- I gave you a camera! I helped you!

01:06:13.011 --> 01:06:14.479
Don't pretend like you did this for me.

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:16.056
You didn't do this for me,
and you know it.

01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:20.018
This was never about me.
This was always about Alice!

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:21.227
Action!

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:23.029
I'm going to stay here and investigate.

01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:26.324
I think it's safer
if you leave town for a couple of days.

01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:29.369
John, I don't like it.
This case- These murders.

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:30.661
Well, what am I supposed to do...

01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:32.535
Well, you're the one
who wanted the wife in the movie.

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:33.911
Not so you could fall in love with her.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.163
What do you care
what I think about Alice anyway?

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:37.835
Because I like her!

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:39.879
That's why I asked her to do this thing
in the first place,

01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:42.548
so I could get to know her. Not you!

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:46.674
- You like Alice Dainard?
- You're such an idiot!

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:48.630
- Watch out!
- Joe, what the hell are you...

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:50.681
- Oh, my God! Shit!
- Run!

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:56.896
Shit. Look at all that smoke.
I can't use this.

01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:01.313
You won't even let me
blow up your train.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:04.108
Everything's bogus.

01:07:08.066 --> 01:07:11.240
We could make another train
and blow that one up.

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:17.917
I do like her.

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:20.457
- Sorry about that.
- Shut up.

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:23.047
It's okay.

01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:25.966
That's not even what bothers me.

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:30.008
She likes you, too.

01:07:31.756 --> 01:07:33.258
That's what really bothers me.

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:37.559
I know it sounds stupid.
Why would she ever like me?

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:41.434
I haven't leaned out yet
and the doctor says it's gonna happen.

01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:46.397
I don't know. Everything's just so bogus.

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:48.030
Charles.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:58.658
Joe, what the hell?

01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:01.419
What is that?

01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:03.497
What is that?

01:08:21.139 --> 01:08:24.609
- Mr. Harkin! What's going on?
- Evacuation! The fire!

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:29.479
Wait, wait!

01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:40.537
The county is being evacuated due to
a wildfire that is raging out of control,

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:43.917
and threatening to reach
the Lillian chemical plant.

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:48.291
Please take with you
essential items only.

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:50.091
If you are driving your own vehicle,

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:53.091
follow the Cara van
to the evacuation center:

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:55.221
Please remain calm.

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:27.497
File in.

01:09:28.038 --> 01:09:29.586
File in, please, file in.

01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:33.086
- Corporal.
- I left the medication my wife needs.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:36.469
Sir, the town is sealed off.
No one's allowed in.

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:38.595
- H through N.
- I can't get it anywhere else.

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:40.017
Charles!

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:41.598
Excuse me.

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:44.272
Charles, oh, thank God.

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:46.270
I went back to the house
and you were gone.

01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:48.067
Yeah, they put us on the bus.

01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:50.645
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey. I'm gonna find my dad.

01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:52.729
- You gonna tell him about that huge...
- Yes.

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:54.441
Come back if you can't find him!

01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:07.461
Mr. Dainard, it's Joe Lamb.

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:10.666
I know you don't like me and I'm sorry
about that, but I'm looking for my dad.

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:13.126
It took her.

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:16.050
- It took Alice.
- What?

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:18.138
I saw it. It was big.

01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:21.514
And, I don't know, it was something

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:24.850
I've never... I've never...

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:27.978
No one believes me.
They just keep giving me pills and...

01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:30.484
No one believes me.

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:32.604
I believe you.

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:38.776
That thing took her?

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:41.739
We have to go back to town
to find Alice, to find her. Come on, guys.

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:43.915
- Dude, she's dead. Alice is dead...
- Don't say that!

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:45.958
First of all, I want to live. Okay?

01:10:46.033 --> 01:10:47.785
Joe, what do you actually
expect to do, man?

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:49.997
The town's closed.
We're not allowed to go back.

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:52.047
Look, I have an idea.
I'm going whether or not you come,

01:10:52.123 --> 01:10:53.966
which I really hope you do.
Come on, guys.

01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:55.668
I have six tons of explosives
in this thing.

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:57.595
Let's find that thing and blow it to shit!

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.217
As if I'm gonna help you.

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:01.595
Do this for me,
I'll babysit the twins next week,

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:03.347
so you can go to Wendy's stupid party.

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:05.182
I'm not shitting you.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.808
You can't ask me any questions, though,

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:09.141
and you can't tell anyone.
I'm serious. Nobody.

01:11:09.223 --> 01:11:11.146
Does it have to be him?

01:11:11.225 --> 01:11:13.819
Yes or no, you ugly freak!
I'm about to rescind the offer.

01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:19.284
This whole evacuation thing's
really freaking me out.

01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:21.326
Making me rethink my priorities.

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:25.832
Saw you over here
and thought maybe we could kick back.

01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:28.455
We... We totally could.

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:32.289
I asked Charles about you
and he said you're a great guy.

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:34.211
I totally am.

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:38.545
Will you hate me if I start
our relationship by asking a favor?

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:41.593
So, there are rules
to being in my car, okay?

01:11:41.672 --> 01:11:43.140
Where the hell are we going, anyway?

01:11:43.216 --> 01:11:44.638
We're going to go to the school
and open the trailer

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:47.391
Woodward has in the parking lot.
I bet that...

01:11:48.638 --> 01:11:50.311
I bet that's where
he's keeping his research.

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:51.732
Research. What research?

01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:53.484
We're gonna learn everything we can
about that thing,

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:56.028
so that we can find it
and that's how we're gonna save Alice.

01:11:56.103 --> 01:11:57.229
Come on. Let's go!

01:11:57.313 --> 01:12:00.988
Dorks, no shoes on my upholstery.
And no one touches my C.B.

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:02.114
- You got it?
- The dungeon? Are you serious?

01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:04.287
Why else are there six padlocks
on the door?

01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:06.330
We're going to the school.

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:08.078
Since when did this one
become so bossy?

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:09.409
I don't know.

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:14.918
I got to take a leak! What am
I supposed to do, piss in here?

01:12:22.547 --> 01:12:24.140
Thanks for the hospitality.

01:12:28.803 --> 01:12:31.602
Am I gonna go in alone,
or are you gonna end up coming with...

01:13:17.351 --> 01:13:18.568
...driving your own vehicle,

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:21.614
follow the Cara van
to the evacuation center:

01:13:31.157 --> 01:13:33.034
If the Air Force has already searched
Woodward's house,

01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:35.245
wouldn't they have searched
stuff in the schoolroom, too?

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:36.420
Yeah, man, I was just thinking
about that, too.

01:13:36.495 --> 01:13:38.748
Maybe his room, but not the dungeon.

01:13:38.873 --> 01:13:40.750
Woodward keeps all kinds
of weird stuff in the dungeon.

01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:42.127
Shut up!

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:44.670
So, what kind of music does she like,
your sister?

01:13:45.504 --> 01:13:47.882
I don't care. Disco, I guess.

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:50.268
I can get back into disco.

01:13:50.509 --> 01:13:52.887
We shouldn't take River Road,
they put a roadblock up.

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:55.769
Dork, I saw it. Observe.

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:09.278
So, what, I just wait here like a douche?

01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:12.832
Yes. Thank you so much for doing this.
Do you have a tire iron?

01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:25.382
Joe, let me try! Joe, let me try!

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:27.843
God, I hope my Electronic Football
is in there.

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:32.643
Joe, this is impossible, man.
There's no way we can do this.

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:34.891
These things are made like
a bank vault, like a safe.

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:38.020
Professional robbers can't even get in
through these things. They're so...

01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:40.184
Shit!

01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:42.148
I loosened it for you.

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:47.237
- Guys.
- Look at all this junk!

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:48.533
He's got movies in here.

01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:51.032
I can't believe
we're breaking into the school!

01:14:51.112 --> 01:14:54.332
Who does that? Nobody does that!
Idiots do that!

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.630
Dr. Woodward was dishonorably
discharged from Nellie Air Force Base

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:06.837
in 1963 because of
"subversive conduct," whatever that is.

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:09.263
Charles, check it out.
It's Old Man Woodward.

01:15:10.965 --> 01:15:12.967
Back when he was like
Middle-Aged Man Woodward.

01:15:14.385 --> 01:15:17.104
He's been tracking this thing
since 1958.

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:20.566
What is this?

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:24.820
It says, "April 8th, 1963 incident. "

01:15:25.312 --> 01:15:26.529
I don't know.

01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:32.535
- Cary!
- What?

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:34.409
We have to find this thing. Come on!

01:15:34.488 --> 01:15:35.831
Okay. Sorry.

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:42.752
...told them that this creature
is more sophisticated than any of us,

01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:48.386
that his species
is predominantly subterranean.

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:50.011
- Subterranean.
- And that he is being treated

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:52.636
without compassion or respect.

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:58.187
I explained that all he wants
is to rebuild his ship,

01:15:58.262 --> 01:16:02.688
a craft made up of those cubes,
a complex shape-shifting alloy.

01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:06.772
Remarkable material
that we'll never fully understand.

01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:13.654
He has been desperate to reconstitute
his ship since it crashed here in '58-

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.791
But instead of giving him the help
he needs, we've held him as a prisoner

01:16:19.033 --> 01:16:20.626
- Guys, it's Dr. Woodward!
- He's been restrained

01:16:20.701 --> 01:16:24.376
and experimented upon,
biopsied, and tortured by Nelec.

01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:29.168
Through pain and lack of compassion,
we have taught him to hate us all.

01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:32.380
We have turned him into an enemy.

01:16:32.463 --> 01:16:36.593
I told them I knew these things
because he made Contact with me,

01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:39.724
that he makes a psychic connection
by touch.

01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:42.265
Oh, my God!

01:16:42.348 --> 01:16:44.271
- What is that thing?
- What the hell?

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:46.193
- I can't watch this.
- Martin, you're gonna throw up, man.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:50.273
The moment we made contact,
I understood him, and he me.

01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:56.287
What I know is that if we don't change
this and begin helping him,

01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:00.199
we will all pay the price.

01:17:01.826 --> 01:17:03.248
But Nelec won't listen.

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:05.295
He wasn't trying to kill it.

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:07.419
He'll have me discharged.

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:08.920
He was trying to help it escape.

01:17:08.999 --> 01:17:10.125
But I won't give up.

01:17:11.043 --> 01:17:13.296
I will do everything in my power

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:14.551
- to set him free.
- Oh, my God.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:18.180
- You guys hear that?
- Help him rebuild that ship. I won't...

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.057
Freeze! Nobody move!

01:17:25.683 --> 01:17:27.060
Do not move!

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:40.702
We got positive I.D. Here.
It's just a bunch of kids.

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:41.907
Oh, Shit.

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.332
Search them.

01:17:46.954 --> 01:17:48.547
Let me see that.

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:52.965
I rolled those M-80s myself.

01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:55.968
- That's right.
- Jesus, Cary, shut up.

01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:59.467
You're the Deputy's boy.

01:18:03.304 --> 01:18:04.351
No.

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:07.350
Move out!

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:23.658
Oh, Shit. Oh, Shit. Oh, Shit. Oh, Shit.

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:30.293
Breaker, breaker.
Requesting police backup.

01:18:31.665 --> 01:18:33.667
Breaker 1-9. Is this the police channel?

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:41.683
- Staff Sergeant.
- Hi. How are you doing?

01:18:44.136 --> 01:18:45.638
Hey, Mr. Lamb!

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:47.394
Rosko.

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:50.271
Hey. Where the hell have you been?

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:52.479
- What are you wearing?
- Come here.

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:55.690
The Air Force set that fire. They want
the town empty for some reason.

01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:57.195
This whole operation,
this whole military operation,

01:18:57.274 --> 01:18:59.072
the evacuation, everything, it's all bad.

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:00.994
- We need to find...
- Did you hear about Joe?

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:05.333
Look, dispatch just got
a call on citizens' band.

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:06.829
Joe and some of his friends,

01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:10.706
they were grabbed by military personnel
at the middle school.

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:17.838
Preston, you tell me everything,
and I won't throw you in jail.

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:22.475
Yes, sir.
But I think you should look at this first.

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:29.273
Chief Master Sergeant,
Dustoff-03 is 20 minutes out.

01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:33.478
Roger that. Perimeter secure. Standing
by on lookout. Prepare to engage.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:36.154
Teams Kilo-Lima-Mike-November
in position.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:39.234
Teams Oscar-Foxtrot-Quebec-Romeo
in position.

01:19:39.942 --> 01:19:42.240
Cocked and locked. Ready to go.

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:48.501
What's going to happen to us?

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:51.124
I think we're gonna die.

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:54.298
Cary, shut up, man.
They wouldn't do that.

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:56.967
I'm not kidding.
I think they're gonna kill us.

01:19:57.668 --> 01:20:00.968
They're not gonna kill us.
You know why?

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:02.389
- Why?
- Because we're just...

01:20:04.758 --> 01:20:05.805
Hold on!

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.313
Hold on!

01:20:18.063 --> 01:20:19.986
Was that that thing from the train?

01:20:24.778 --> 01:20:26.246
Why are we stopping?

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:27.665
- Why are we stopped?
- Holy shit!

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:29.834
Contact with precious cargo,
three clicks from city center.

01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:31.125
Currently heading towards...

01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:34.876
- Driver! Can you see anything up there?
- No, sir! Nothing.

01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:37.583
What's that gun?

01:20:38.625 --> 01:20:40.969
Sako Bolt Action thirty-aught six with...

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:42.171
Okay, we get it.

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:44.723
Those aren't bullets.
He's loading tracking darts.

01:20:44.798 --> 01:20:46.926
Here. Tag it.

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:53.936
Yes, Sir.

01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:56.230
Open the door!

01:21:21.085 --> 01:21:23.304
I don't feel good about this.

01:21:28.967 --> 01:21:31.641
Sir, is there a particular area
that you'd want me to shoot...

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:41.238
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:21:41.313 --> 01:21:42.906
Help!

01:21:47.194 --> 01:21:48.537
Oh, my God!

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:49.784
Get us out of here now!

01:21:50.322 --> 01:21:51.574
What other firepower do we have?

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:55.082
- There's a monster out there, Joe!
- What the hell is it?

01:22:01.792 --> 01:22:03.169
I got it, sir!

01:22:17.141 --> 01:22:18.939
- Guys, the seat belt is killing me!
- Unhook it!

01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:20.269
Come on!

01:22:20.644 --> 01:22:21.861
Come on!

01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:37.411
This is Nelec. Use the big guns.

01:22:37.494 --> 01:22:40.373
Whatever happens to me,
do not let it...

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:43.959
- Joe, open it!
- Open the door!

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:47.046
- It's bolted!
- I want to go home so bad!

01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:48.597
Open the door.

01:22:48.672 --> 01:22:50.891
- Please, sir.
- Just let us out!

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:53.184
Please open it!

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:54.386
Where are the keys?

01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:56.309
Overmyer had them!

01:22:56.388 --> 01:22:58.607
Help me! My leg's stuck!

01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:00.229
Please, sir, open the door!

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:01.731
Please, open the door!

01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:07.862
Another one dead!

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:11.786
Guys, there's broken glass.

01:23:11.904 --> 01:23:13.030
Guys!

01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:15.332
Martin! Martin!
Let me get on your shoulders. Come on.

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:16.499
Go, go, get up!

01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:17.997
- Here we go.
- Go!

01:23:18.076 --> 01:23:20.170
- Come on, Joe! You can do it!
- Come on, Joe!

01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:22.373
- You can do it, Joe! Let's go.
- Come on!

01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:23.878
- Come on!
- You can do it! Come on!

01:23:31.131 --> 01:23:32.974
Joe, please! Go!

01:23:33.383 --> 01:23:36.307
- Come on. Break the glass, you pussy!
- Come on, Joe! Hit it! Come on!

01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:49.445
We got to go!

01:23:56.073 --> 01:23:58.292
- Go!
- Come on, guys, hurry!

01:24:33.318 --> 01:24:36.743
Come with us. We got some questions
for you. Come on.

01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:38.199
- Oh, no. Is she dead?
- Just come with us.

01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:40.751
Hey, fellows,
I've got orders from Colonel Nelec

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:42.328
to personally deliver this man
back to base.

01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:45.210
- He's all yours, Staff Sergeant.
- Let's go.

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:48.042
What are you doing?
Where are we going?

01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:49.968
To find our kids.

01:24:53.672 --> 01:24:56.676
Hey, guys! Guys, I found them!

01:24:58.302 --> 01:25:01.101
Hey, guys! I found my firecrackers!

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:02.180
Congratulations.

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:06.394
Let's go, guys, they're coming back.
I think we should go. Come on.

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:08.733
Guys, come on.

01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:11.198
No. No, look.

01:25:15.193 --> 01:25:18.037
You dorks are alive? I thought that...

01:25:20.365 --> 01:25:21.742
What the fuck?

01:25:21.825 --> 01:25:22.997
Donny. Donny.

01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:24.623
We need a ride into town.

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:28.424
Okay, but just so you know,
I'm massively stoned right now.

01:25:29.041 --> 01:25:31.009
Do you want me to drive?

01:25:34.713 --> 01:25:36.841
- Guys, what was that?
- It sounds like gunshots.

01:25:36.923 --> 01:25:39.301
- Joe, where are we going?
- I saw something in the cemetery.

01:25:39.384 --> 01:25:42.433
Woodward said it was subterranean.
I think I know where it is.

01:25:42.512 --> 01:25:45.231
What the hell is that?
Move the damn car!

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:54.157
- God!
- Joe, turn the car around!

01:25:54.232 --> 01:25:55.484
- I can't. There's a tank behind us.
- Holy shit!

01:25:55.567 --> 01:25:57.035
- What are they shooting at?
- Guys, we have to run.

01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:58.908
Donny! Hey, Donny, wake up!

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:01.831
- He's too stoned!
- Drugs are so bad!

01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:10.753
- Why is everyone firing?
- We gotta go!

01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:13.085
Guys, come on, hurry!

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:15.921
- This is crazy!
- What is going on?

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.431
Look! It just exploded!

01:26:18.757 --> 01:26:22.182
Sir! The weapons are misfiring!
All of them!

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:25.730
Surface-to-air! Radar!
It's a mess out here, sir!

01:26:27.808 --> 01:26:29.856
Guys! Guys, run!

01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:31.354
Come on!

01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:33.314
What the hell is this?

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.198
Go, Cary, go!

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:39.156
- Jesus!
- Go!

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:45.792
What the hell?
Holy shit!

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:57.759
Why is everyone firing?

01:27:00.298 --> 01:27:02.300
Go, come on!
Move ahead!

01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:06.847
Oh, my God!

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:16.239
Come on, guys, move!

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:19.238
Did you guys see those explosions?
They were... They were huge!

01:27:19.985 --> 01:27:21.362
Oh, my God.

01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:24.747
Whose house is this?

01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:27.201
It's Kathy's. I got it off the fridge.

01:27:27.284 --> 01:27:29.412
Kathy? Yeah, I know her.

01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:32.290
Charles, what are you thinking, dude?
That's not yours!

01:27:32.372 --> 01:27:34.420
What, I'm thirsty. I'm in a war zone!

01:27:34.499 --> 01:27:35.921
- Clear! Clear!
- Come on, move!

01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:37.719
Let's go, move out!

01:27:38.336 --> 01:27:40.088
- Guys, come on, let's go.
- Where are we going?

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:41.549
To the cemetery. I'm...

01:27:47.012 --> 01:27:49.731
Guys, what happened to my leg?
Man, it hurts!

01:27:51.224 --> 01:27:54.524
Holy shit, Martin, you've got
a bone sticking out of your leg!

01:27:55.896 --> 01:27:58.115
Joe, give me that thing off the curtains!

01:27:58.190 --> 01:27:59.362
God!

01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:03.366
I've got to go find Alice.
You guys stay here with Martin.

01:28:03.904 --> 01:28:05.577
You gonna be okay without me?

01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:07.456
Yeah.

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:11.625
- I'm not staying with the girls!
- God, Cary! Shut up!

01:28:11.703 --> 01:28:13.705
- Calm down!
- Come on! Come on!

01:28:13.789 --> 01:28:15.041
It hurts, Joe!

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:17.546
Okay, this is going to hurt
really bad, okay?

01:28:18.418 --> 01:28:20.512
Jesus, Martin, I haven't done it yet!

01:28:31.765 --> 01:28:32.982
Just... Just follow me. Just follow me.

01:28:33.058 --> 01:28:36.278
I've been following you for the last five
blocks! What are we doing here?

01:28:36.353 --> 01:28:38.572
Come on, through these doors.
Help me.

01:28:38.647 --> 01:28:41.651
- Help you with what?
- We have to get inside.

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:43.531
Okay, okay. For what?

01:28:44.444 --> 01:28:45.821
I'll tell you in a second.

01:28:45.904 --> 01:28:48.032
Why is there dirt in these windows?

01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:53.329
It's here. Hard on three.
One, two, three.

01:28:53.411 --> 01:28:55.209
One, two, three!

01:28:55.288 --> 01:28:58.087
- One, two, three! One, two, three!
- One, two, three! One, two, three!

01:29:08.593 --> 01:29:10.436
This... This is scary.

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:12.268
You got any sparklers in there?

01:29:13.515 --> 01:29:14.516
Are you kidding me?

01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:28.114
Alice is down there.

01:29:43.753 --> 01:29:45.926
I came to your house that day

01:29:46.798 --> 01:29:50.348
to tell you that
I never meant to hurt anyone.

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:54.063
I swear to God.

01:29:57.225 --> 01:29:58.818
I'm sorry, Jack.

01:30:00.687 --> 01:30:03.110
About what happened to your wife.

01:30:11.948 --> 01:30:13.666
It was an accident.

01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:22.751
It was an accident.

01:30:41.937 --> 01:30:43.735
Joe, I don't understand...

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:48.405
This way.

01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:59.706
Why are you so surprised?
I always wear lipstick on my shirt.

01:31:44.874 --> 01:31:46.376
- It's Sheriff Pruitt!
- I know.

01:31:46.793 --> 01:31:48.170
Cary, look.

01:31:51.256 --> 01:31:52.883
There are bodies everywhere.

01:31:52.966 --> 01:31:56.186
- What is this?
- We're under the water tower. Look.

01:32:04.894 --> 01:32:07.613
She's got to be here.
She's got to be here.

01:32:20.493 --> 01:32:22.495
It's eating a person.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.092
She's here.

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:30.128
Oh, my God. I see her.

01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:33.139
Okay.
We're going to use your firecrackers.

01:32:34.049 --> 01:32:36.177
I don't think that's gonna hurt him, Joe.

01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:38.853
- There's other tunnels.
- So?

01:32:38.928 --> 01:32:41.647
I need you to make noise
right here in two minutes.

01:32:41.723 --> 01:32:44.943
Make it loud and make it last.
Give me some sparklers.

01:32:45.018 --> 01:32:49.364
Make sure you're gone when it blows.
You can't be here. You got to run.

01:32:50.607 --> 01:32:52.359
Where are you going?

01:33:26.935 --> 01:33:28.357
Come on, Cary.

01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:17.698
Alice. Alice. Please, we have to go.
Come on.

01:34:17.777 --> 01:34:19.745
Alice! Alice!

01:34:21.156 --> 01:34:23.124
Please, come on.
We have to go. Alice!

01:34:30.123 --> 01:34:31.966
You're alive! You're alive.

01:34:32.584 --> 01:34:35.258
You're alive. Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

01:34:35.336 --> 01:34:38.340
What is this? What are you doing here?

01:34:38.423 --> 01:34:40.141
I'm just doing the best I can to save you.

01:34:50.185 --> 01:34:51.858
How did you know?

01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:55.695
Your dad. He told me. He was worried.

01:34:55.773 --> 01:34:57.400
And flipping out.

01:34:58.026 --> 01:34:59.494
- Really?
- We have to move.

01:34:59.986 --> 01:35:01.329
Excuse me?

01:35:03.656 --> 01:35:05.124
Where are we?

01:35:06.075 --> 01:35:07.122
I left my bag in the car,

01:35:07.202 --> 01:35:09.125
and then I went out to the car
to get my bag...

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:10.672
It's been locked up for years.

01:35:10.747 --> 01:35:13.626
It's terrified and hungry
and it just wants to go home.

01:35:13.708 --> 01:35:14.709
When it touched me, I knew.

01:35:14.792 --> 01:35:17.466
I need you to help me
get the Sheriff down.

01:35:28.806 --> 01:35:30.353
Follow me this way.
I'll get us out of here.

01:35:30.433 --> 01:35:32.481
- Sheriff, we came that way.
- Don't argue with me! Just follow me!

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.028
Come on, kids, let's go with the Sheriff.

01:35:45.865 --> 01:35:47.162
This way.

01:35:49.118 --> 01:35:50.335
Joe!

01:35:52.455 --> 01:35:53.752
I told you to get out!
What are you doing here?

01:35:53.831 --> 01:35:56.630
I thought this was the way out.
Okay, I tried.

01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:58.336
- Hey, Alice, welcome back.
- Hey!

01:35:58.419 --> 01:36:00.171
Come on! We got to get out of here...

01:36:02.632 --> 01:36:03.679
Guys, hurry!

01:36:07.303 --> 01:36:08.520
Come on, go!

01:36:12.684 --> 01:36:15.858
She's gone! It took her!
I don't want to be next!

01:36:37.959 --> 01:36:42.135
- Go! You don't want to be here! Go!
- Joe, what are you doing?

01:36:50.305 --> 01:36:52.148
Ally, what the hell is he doing?

01:36:52.223 --> 01:36:53.725
We understand!

01:36:57.562 --> 01:36:58.779
But not everyone's horrible.

01:37:00.231 --> 01:37:01.778
- No!
- Joe!

01:37:03.526 --> 01:37:04.994
Let him down!

01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:17.081
I know bad things happen.

01:37:19.584 --> 01:37:21.257
Bad things happen.

01:37:25.173 --> 01:37:27.096
But you can still live.

01:37:31.554 --> 01:37:32.897
You can still live.

01:38:15.515 --> 01:38:17.313
Okay, wait a minute.

01:38:17.642 --> 01:38:18.814
What?

01:39:06.399 --> 01:39:08.276
- Look out!
- Get down! Get down!

01:39:46.105 --> 01:39:47.573
What is he doing?

01:39:48.733 --> 01:39:50.531
He's making a model.

01:40:35.404 --> 01:40:36.747
I got you.

01:40:38.616 --> 01:40:39.959
I got you.

01:42:28.059 --> 01:42:29.982
Holy shit!

01:44:24.592 --> 01:44:26.265
This is where my friend was attacked.

01:44:26.343 --> 01:44:28.471
- By who?
- I've never seen him before.

01:44:28.763 --> 01:44:32.063
He looked pale, crazy. He bit my friend.

01:44:32.141 --> 01:44:33.563
- Then what happened?
- He was dead.

01:44:33.642 --> 01:44:35.440
- And then...
- He got up and walked away?

01:44:35.519 --> 01:44:37.317
- How did you know?
- Anything left behind?

01:44:37.688 --> 01:44:40.316
Yes, this fell out of the pocket
of the attacker's pocket.

01:44:40.399 --> 01:44:41.491
Thank you.

01:44:44.403 --> 01:44:46.576
Hello, Mr. President.
I'm Detective Hathaway.

01:44:46.655 --> 01:44:50.501
I'm here to discuss some urgent matters
regarding your chemical factory.

01:44:50.576 --> 01:44:52.578
Are you referring
to the recent incidents?

01:44:52.661 --> 01:44:53.662
Yes, I believe I am.

01:44:53.746 --> 01:44:55.123
Tell the chairman I'll call him back.

01:44:55.539 --> 01:44:57.166
You have three minutes.

01:44:57.792 --> 01:45:00.466
You want to tell me
about those employees?

01:45:00.544 --> 01:45:04.014
I was sorry to hear
of their unfortunate accident.

01:45:04.089 --> 01:45:07.343
That was no accident!
Did you see the bites on their neck?

01:45:07.426 --> 01:45:08.928
Are you suggesting some connection

01:45:09.011 --> 01:45:12.515
between my chemical company
and those, those...

01:45:12.598 --> 01:45:14.316
Those were zombie attacks!

01:45:14.517 --> 01:45:17.270
Romero Chemical has nothing to do
with any such thing.

01:45:17.394 --> 01:45:19.021
Then what happens in Building 47?

01:45:19.522 --> 01:45:22.401
You wouldn't mind
if I took a look around, would you?

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:24.947
Of course not.

01:45:28.697 --> 01:45:30.324
Good day to you, Mr. President.

01:45:30.407 --> 01:45:32.125
Good day, Detective.

01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:35.587
He knows.

01:46:07.945 --> 01:46:09.993
Judith. It's me, your boss.

01:46:10.072 --> 01:46:11.915
I need you to buy my wife
a ticket to Michigan.

01:46:11.991 --> 01:46:15.461
It's too dangerous for her here.
I just love her so much.

01:46:17.621 --> 01:46:20.374
John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.

01:46:20.457 --> 01:46:22.880
Well, what am I supposed to do,
go to Michigan with you?

01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:25.383
Mackinac Island's beautiful
this time of year.

01:46:25.462 --> 01:46:27.305
Sweetheart, this is my job.

01:46:27.423 --> 01:46:29.266
I just love you so much!

01:46:29.341 --> 01:46:30.638
I love you, too.

01:46:40.269 --> 01:46:42.488
I can't believe
we weren't killed last night.

01:46:42.563 --> 01:46:44.736
Okay, now you have to leave town.

01:46:44.815 --> 01:46:46.658
No. I'm staying here with you.

01:46:46.734 --> 01:46:49.112
I don't know what I would do
if something happened to you.

01:46:49.194 --> 01:46:50.741
What if there are survivors down there?

01:46:50.821 --> 01:46:53.449
There were no survivors!
Did you see that crash?

01:46:53.532 --> 01:46:55.626
Excuse me, sir, were you in the wreck?

01:47:03.167 --> 01:47:05.841
That settles it. I'm not going anywhere.

01:47:08.339 --> 01:47:10.433
It's been two weeks,
and the murders continue.

01:47:10.507 --> 01:47:12.259
This investigation is like no other.

01:47:12.343 --> 01:47:16.189
It's putting too much stress on this town
and on my marriage.

01:47:18.223 --> 01:47:20.100
Could zombies be real?

01:47:22.102 --> 01:47:24.104
Hello? This is Detective Hathaway.

01:47:24.188 --> 01:47:25.906
I'll be right over.

01:47:26.690 --> 01:47:29.113
- What's happening here?
- A military police investigation.

01:47:29.193 --> 01:47:30.490
It was a suicide.

01:47:30.569 --> 01:47:33.698
- A suicide? Who was it?
- A former Air Force officer.

01:47:33.781 --> 01:47:36.034
Said there was a secret
he couldn't keep any longer.

01:47:36.116 --> 01:47:38.084
It says he worked for Dr. Peter Braken?

01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:39.753
I never would have given you
this information

01:47:39.828 --> 01:47:41.375
if we hadn't served together in Vietnam.

01:47:41.872 --> 01:47:44.375
- Those were hard times.
- I'd rather not talk about it.

01:47:47.336 --> 01:47:48.883
- Doctor.
- Detective.

01:47:48.963 --> 01:47:51.091
I'm here to discuss your involvement
with Romero Chemical?

01:47:51.173 --> 01:47:53.596
I was the one that developed
the special compound

01:47:53.676 --> 01:47:55.474
to turn all these humans into zombies.

01:47:55.552 --> 01:47:57.771
It was supposed to be used
as a military weapon,

01:47:57.846 --> 01:47:59.974
but it got out of hand.
So I made this antidote

01:48:00.057 --> 01:48:02.651
that will hopefully cure
all of the zombies.

01:48:02.726 --> 01:48:04.478
That's incredible!
How much have you made?

01:48:04.937 --> 01:48:06.530
Just this one.

01:48:06.605 --> 01:48:10.735
Would you like to help me test it
on this innocent victim of my creation?

01:48:32.297 --> 01:48:33.640
Honey, I'm home!

01:48:33.716 --> 01:48:37.061
Good news. We found a cure
for the zombie infection.

01:48:37.136 --> 01:48:38.308
Honey?

01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:03.045
Sorry. It didn't work. I wish it worked.

01:49:03.287 --> 01:49:05.961
I tried. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:49:07.624 --> 01:49:08.625
John?

01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:26.439
This has been
a Charles Kaznyk production.

01:49:27.144 --> 01:49:30.489
We had such a fun time filming
this movie, The Case.

01:49:30.981 --> 01:49:33.655
So much fun that I hope you pick it

01:49:33.734 --> 01:49:37.159
for the Cleveland International
Super 8 Film Festival.

01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:38.781
God!
