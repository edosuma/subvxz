WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:08.421
-So... Are we ready?
-Yes.

00:09.046 --> 00:10.046
Let me see...

00:10.546 --> 00:12.505
No looking just yet.

00:16.171 --> 00:17.171
There we go.

00:17.255 --> 00:20.713
I've noticed the first client of the day
is often the keenest.

00:20.796 --> 00:21.963
You could say that.

00:23.213 --> 00:24.630
Take a look at yourself.

00:31.421 --> 00:32.255
Beautiful.

00:32.755 --> 00:36.005
Tell me, what kind of ceremony
are we talking about?

00:37.005 --> 00:38.005
Complicated. All right.

00:40.713 --> 00:42.921
Do you want me
to take a photo for your mom?

00:43.005 --> 00:44.005
Absolutely not.

00:44.755 --> 00:45.796
All right...

00:49.755 --> 00:50.755
Here.

00:53.755 --> 00:56.088
-For your bridesmaids?
-I don't have any.

00:56.463 --> 01:00.046
I accused one of blowing our friend
and we hired a man-whore for the other.

01:03.380 --> 01:05.630
-For your groom?
-He doesn't know.

01:06.755 --> 01:08.755
He might not say yes, I've been awful.

01:10.296 --> 01:11.296
All right.

01:17.546 --> 01:19.005
All right...

01:19.713 --> 01:23.088
- Keep the dress and we'll call a taxi.
- All right.

01:23.380 --> 01:24.380
All right? Taxi!

01:26.380 --> 01:28.255
We have a woman in labor!

01:28.338 --> 01:30.880
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:30.963 --> 01:32.921
THE LAME PLAN

01:33.005 --> 01:34.671
THE CRAZY PLAN

01:34.755 --> 01:37.296
THE BOOTY PLAN

01:37.380 --> 01:39.255
THE HOOK-UP PLAN

01:47.463 --> 01:48.796
FOR DADDY

02:10.505 --> 02:12.421
You're even late telling me you quit.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.588
HR sent an email at 7.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.421
Sorry.

02:18.505 --> 02:20.921
I'd asked them to wait
so I could tell you myself.

02:21.588 --> 02:22.755
So, you weren't kidding?

02:23.255 --> 02:24.505
-Buenos Aires?
-Yep.

02:25.671 --> 02:28.338
Actually, you picked the right time.

02:31.338 --> 02:34.463
ELSA. Establishing Liaison
for Street people Association.

02:34.963 --> 02:38.380
The association you contacted
is applying to transform the sports hall.

02:38.963 --> 02:40.963
Well, at least, I served a purpose.

02:42.546 --> 02:43.838
It's a great leaving gift.

02:45.963 --> 02:46.963
Come here.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.588
-Are you leaving because of the PR dick?
-No.

02:56.546 --> 02:59.630
His demented hyena eyes
have been looking for you everywhere.

03:03.088 --> 03:04.088
Come on.

03:05.380 --> 03:07.046
-Get out of here!
-OK.

03:16.046 --> 03:17.921
So, we're letting that asshole win?

03:19.796 --> 03:22.380
-You stop the only thing you're good at...
-Thanks.

03:23.380 --> 03:24.671
It's better for Elsa.

03:25.255 --> 03:26.713
What if she came to the bar? It's over, dude, OK?

03:29.588 --> 03:31.213
Now we need a solution for my mom.

03:32.130 --> 03:33.963
You can tell Mom...

03:34.796 --> 03:39.296
"Mom, I lost my job, I'm struggling,
but don't worry, I've got it."

03:39.963 --> 03:42.630
Tell the truth, be honest,
Chabichou-style.

03:42.713 --> 03:44.630
I'm done with lying, OK?

03:44.713 --> 03:46.255
My dad did enough of that.

03:46.338 --> 03:51.630
So, I want to save, find a normal job,
move and take responsibility.

03:52.380 --> 03:53.838
OK, so, we're breaking up?

03:55.671 --> 03:58.213
What are you talking about,
stupid? Hang on.

03:59.088 --> 04:01.588
You know
you're the only person I can trust.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.005
What film is that from?

04:10.505 --> 04:13.213
-No film, I'm being honest.
-Yeah, whatever.

04:18.963 --> 04:21.630
A smoking relapse
isn't the best way to avoid me.

04:21.713 --> 04:23.171
What? I'm not avoiding you.

04:24.380 --> 04:25.796
That was me being hysterical.

04:26.380 --> 04:27.630
You seem to like it.

04:27.713 --> 04:31.130
Milou isn't hysterical,
she's just insecure.

04:32.046 --> 04:34.005
HR-43-OI-75!

04:34.088 --> 04:35.171
-Write it down!
-Fuck!

04:35.255 --> 04:38.171
The jerk kicked me out,
thinking I'd give birth in his wreck!

04:38.255 --> 04:39.588
Calm down! Up you come!

04:40.130 --> 04:41.338
Breathe!

04:42.255 --> 04:44.713
-What's this dress?
-Is this the right time?!

04:45.213 --> 04:48.171
I'm going to be a dad!

04:48.838 --> 04:50.255
I better get a room ready.

04:52.380 --> 04:54.671
Crazy to think
we're going to meet their baby.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.005
Our best friends' own human being.

04:58.546 --> 05:01.838
It wasn't supposed to be today.
She'll do anything to piss me off.

05:02.630 --> 05:04.463
Fine but hurry or we'll be late.

05:04.546 --> 05:08.255
Calm down, a baby is born
every four seconds around the world.

05:08.338 --> 05:10.338
And it's Moules-Frites's 180th birthday.

05:10.421 --> 05:12.921
I bought him Lebanese kofta,
he bloody loves it.

05:13.755 --> 05:15.880
-Did you not have an interview?
-Postponed.

05:16.505 --> 05:17.505
She could postpone.

05:18.505 --> 05:21.255
I'm working on my project,
Pink Cars, remember that?

05:21.796 --> 05:23.588
With your stupid marketing tools,

05:23.671 --> 05:26.880
I mean, tools that are essential
to the setting up of a company.

05:26.963 --> 05:30.380
Page 183: "Take advantage of your anger
before it takes advantage of you."

05:30.463 --> 05:31.838
I.e. stop being a dick.

05:31.921 --> 05:32.963
Right, I'm off.

05:34.088 --> 05:36.088
-Bye!
-Yeah, whatever.

05:42.130 --> 05:43.921
Wait! We need to take Milou's bag!

05:49.630 --> 05:50.796
Just like his mother.

05:51.380 --> 05:53.296
No, that voice is from my side.

05:59.796 --> 06:02.296
-What's this? Who's this?
-Who's this?

06:02.380 --> 06:04.713
-Who is it?
-Oh, yes...

06:05.088 --> 06:06.463
-Oh, yes.
-Who's this?

06:09.255 --> 06:12.838
That's better, isn't it?
You just needed Auntie Chacha's dolly.

06:12.921 --> 06:14.588
Didn't you? Yes, you did!

06:14.671 --> 06:16.880
-I'm your favorite, right?
-No, I am!

06:16.963 --> 06:19.588
-Uncle Matt is your favorite.
-No, Daddy is!

06:19.671 --> 06:21.088
Let him be, he must be tired.

06:21.171 --> 06:23.130
Are you tired after a water park?

06:23.213 --> 06:25.505
Milou didn't exactly help him
down the slide!

06:26.005 --> 06:28.713
-Right, my love? Mommy's lazy!
-I can hear you!

06:30.630 --> 06:31.796
-A bit lazy.
-Still can.

06:33.005 --> 06:36.088
Thanks for bringing the bag
I'd prepared for the charity shop.

06:36.171 --> 06:37.171
-Really.
-Milou.

06:37.255 --> 06:40.088
If it wasn't so messy,
I'd have found the right one.

06:40.171 --> 06:43.713
-Messy? Seriously? Who's talking?
-You two seem to be getting along.

06:44.296 --> 06:45.130
Great.

06:51.505 --> 06:52.505
Hey. Hey.

06:55.546 --> 06:56.546
Here. Thanks.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.130
Coffee?

07:03.046 --> 07:04.255
-Coffee?
-Yeah.

07:04.338 --> 07:06.088
Oh, coffee! Yes, coffee.

07:07.755 --> 07:08.755
Congratulations. Thanks.

07:18.755 --> 07:20.796
-He's beautiful.
-Thanks.

07:22.296 --> 07:23.588
Hold him if you want.

07:26.005 --> 07:27.296
This is for him, too.

07:46.046 --> 07:48.546
-What's his name?
-We haven't decided yet.

07:51.963 --> 07:52.963
Are you OK?

07:55.213 --> 07:56.046
You?

07:57.046 --> 07:58.046
-Great.
-Amazing.

07:58.130 --> 07:58.963
Same.

08:01.755 --> 08:03.713
-I'm happy you're here.
-Me too.

08:04.088 --> 08:05.713
I came for him, really.

08:18.838 --> 08:20.421
-Hey!
-We'd given up on you.

08:20.755 --> 08:23.255
-Yeah. Congratulations, dude!
-Thanks, man.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.421
-Thanks.
-It's amazing. Really.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.005
-How's it going?
-Good and you?

08:27.796 --> 08:29.588
-Right...
-Where are you going?

08:29.671 --> 08:32.380
To see Elsa. And the baby.
The baby, as well.

08:32.463 --> 08:35.255
I mean, not as well.
I'm going to see the baby and if...

08:35.338 --> 08:37.255
Max, now's not the time.

08:37.796 --> 08:40.296
-Why not?
-How's your breakup?

08:41.130 --> 08:42.713
-GaÃ¯a? It's awful.
-Yeah...

08:42.796 --> 08:45.338
-It must be hard.
-Is Elsa up there?

08:45.421 --> 08:46.921
Let them be, they need to talk.

08:47.005 --> 08:49.671
She's upset, she needs me, that's all.

08:49.755 --> 08:51.588
Hey, guys, I'm a dad!

08:51.671 --> 08:53.421
-Let's grab a coffee.
-OK.

08:53.505 --> 08:54.505
Come on.

08:55.630 --> 08:57.046
Are you really leaving?

08:58.838 --> 09:00.171
It's funny.

09:00.255 --> 09:03.463
No one believes me when I'm the only one
who hasn't been lying.

09:05.046 --> 09:06.338
I need a change of scenery.

09:07.421 --> 09:08.421
Buenos Aires. How long?

09:14.505 --> 09:15.505
I don't know.

09:18.338 --> 09:19.671
I wanted to tell you...

09:23.213 --> 09:24.630
It's too late for that.

09:26.046 --> 09:27.046
Right? It's too late.

09:30.755 --> 09:32.213
I'm not a fairy godmother.

09:33.296 --> 09:35.921
I won't tell you that life is amazing.

09:38.630 --> 09:40.463
You'll be disappointed.

09:41.546 --> 09:42.546
Frustrated.

09:43.796 --> 09:46.671
You don't even have a name
so that's not a great start.

09:50.421 --> 09:51.546
But it's worth it.

09:54.255 --> 09:55.630
You've got to hold on.

09:57.171 --> 10:00.505
And grab all the love you can.

10:02.796 --> 10:04.713
Because love really is...

10:06.130 --> 10:07.421
Love is great.

10:09.213 --> 10:10.213
Well...

10:10.838 --> 10:11.671
usually.

10:26.005 --> 10:27.171
I'm leaving.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.171
I don't know how long for.

10:31.713 --> 10:33.005
Long enough to get over...

10:38.338 --> 10:39.921
a dirty trick.

10:44.213 --> 10:48.046
In the meantime, look after
these two nuts crying behind me.

11:01.213 --> 11:02.213
Bye. Buenos Aires?!

11:23.921 --> 11:25.088
Buenos Aires.

11:34.838 --> 11:36.296
I've never seen her like that.

11:36.671 --> 11:38.630
Don't worry, you'll work out.

11:38.713 --> 11:40.046
And you're an auntie now!

11:40.130 --> 11:42.963
Yeah, and you're going
to be seeing a lot more of me.

11:43.463 --> 11:45.921
What do mean?
We already see you every day.

11:46.005 --> 11:50.130
Yeah, but you're going to need me 24/7.
You won't be able to cope on your own.

11:50.713 --> 11:52.838
You live upstairs,
Milou's letting you stay.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.921
I'm talking about sleeping with him.
Next to him, right there.

11:56.880 --> 11:57.880
What's going on? Charlotte?

12:00.755 --> 12:01.755
Spill the beans.

12:02.671 --> 12:06.046
OK, fine. I put the flat on Airbnb
and we have guests tomorrow.

12:06.963 --> 12:08.338
It's only temporary!

12:08.421 --> 12:10.463
Are you crazy?
Do you want her to kill you?

12:10.546 --> 12:11.588
You just made up!

12:12.255 --> 12:15.630
So what, the Airbnb guys come down
while we're having breakfast?

12:15.713 --> 12:19.421
Please, Antoine,
just while Milou is in the hospital.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.796
I'm in the shit,
I need money to invest. Please.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.130
OK, I mean, I don't know.
I'll think about it.

12:24.213 --> 12:25.421
I'm off to see the baby.

12:26.546 --> 12:29.130
-What?
-You're going to be a great dad.

12:29.213 --> 12:30.546
-You think so?
-100%.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.630
-Best bro del mundo!
-And you'll be the best auntie del mundo.

12:40.088 --> 12:41.755
-Right, see you!
-See you.

12:42.380 --> 12:44.671
-Buenos Aires? In Spain?
-Huh? No!

12:44.755 --> 12:46.505
Why is she leaving? To get a job?

12:48.130 --> 12:49.546
To raise llamas?

12:51.338 --> 12:53.505
-Excellent.
-Wait a minute! 6 o'clock.

12:53.588 --> 12:56.046
Au-pair. Scandinavian.
Arrived a month ago.

12:56.380 --> 12:57.505
Not a word of French.

12:58.130 --> 13:00.088
Culture shock. Emotional isolation.

13:00.630 --> 13:02.005
Feeling blue, she's for you.

13:14.088 --> 13:15.088
"BrÃ¼stÃ¼brÃ¼t"?

13:18.963 --> 13:21.046
No, I'm good, thanks.

13:29.171 --> 13:32.380
-You're as useless as your mate.
-What's this got to do with Jules?

13:32.921 --> 13:36.338
"I'll let you think about it for a week
and then be a no-show."

13:37.046 --> 13:38.588
No wonder Elsa's leaving.

13:40.088 --> 13:42.796
-Hang on, Elsa came?
-Think in terms of situation.

13:42.880 --> 13:43.921
CASTING FEEDBACK

13:44.005 --> 13:45.463
Stay focused!

13:45.921 --> 13:46.963
Sorry, I have to go.

13:47.588 --> 13:48.588
Sorry! See you!

13:48.671 --> 13:51.046
Yes, but keep the target in sight.

13:52.588 --> 13:53.588
Miss!

13:54.838 --> 13:56.421
No? OK.

13:57.088 --> 13:58.088
Or Sabri.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.421
Sabri's nice, right?

14:00.505 --> 14:02.171
Even he seems to agree.

14:03.255 --> 14:04.755
-Edouard?
-No...

14:04.838 --> 14:05.921
-Edouard?
-No!

14:06.005 --> 14:09.755
-I think he prefers Edouard.
-I just want a nod to his roots.

14:10.046 --> 14:11.380
And honestly, Edouard?

14:12.046 --> 14:13.713
Talk about a stuck-up old snob.

14:13.796 --> 14:16.338
Precisely. I also want a nod to his roots.

14:20.463 --> 14:21.463
What about Eddie? Eddie's not bad.

14:23.671 --> 14:24.838
And it sounds Arab.

14:27.088 --> 14:28.713
His surname is Ben Smires.

14:29.838 --> 14:32.088
That's not a nod, that's a headbutt.

14:33.046 --> 14:34.505
We are his roots, anyway.

14:35.213 --> 14:36.380
Your grandma is Breton.

14:36.921 --> 14:39.296
Your name isn't Nolwenn,
you don't eat crepes.

14:39.380 --> 14:40.505
But this is different!

14:40.588 --> 14:43.796
You want to piss off your parents,
thinking it will make me happy.

14:44.463 --> 14:45.713
When honestly...

14:45.796 --> 14:47.130
Will you marry me?

14:49.671 --> 14:51.171
Will I... marry you?

14:55.255 --> 14:56.255
Yes! Of course.

14:57.671 --> 15:00.380
But it's not a priority
now we have the baby...

15:00.463 --> 15:01.463
Eddie, do you agree?

15:15.213 --> 15:17.296
-Let her know we're here?
-Right away.

15:23.421 --> 15:27.296
I don't care, you're the stupid-looking
one bringing your girlfriend.

15:27.380 --> 15:30.380
Oh, no, he just regularly inserts
his penis in my vagina.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.796
-I'm here for decoration.
-Are you dumb or what?

15:33.463 --> 15:34.671
It's OK, don't stress.

15:35.213 --> 15:36.838
-What's the job?
-Pink Cars?

15:38.005 --> 15:39.005
What's going on?

15:39.088 --> 15:42.630
A pitch for your project. Sell your idea.
If they like it, they'll invest.

15:43.046 --> 15:45.130
Are you crazy? I'm not ready!

15:45.213 --> 15:47.296
-Charlotte Ben Smires?
-Yes, she's here.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.380
Yes?

15:49.380 --> 15:50.630
Breathe. You're the best.

15:53.296 --> 15:54.296
-Charlotte?
-Yeah?

15:54.380 --> 15:55.546
-I love you.
-What?!

15:55.630 --> 15:57.171
I love you.

15:58.713 --> 16:00.505
-Hello.
-Hello. Sorry about the wait.

16:05.046 --> 16:06.213
Oops!

16:06.296 --> 16:08.755
Anita, put that pastry down,
stay where you are.

16:08.838 --> 16:12.046
Bow down before Flatulor,
King of Flatuland!

16:12.130 --> 16:13.588
-Flatuland?
-Flatulor?

16:13.671 --> 16:15.796
The international Flatuline mascot.

16:15.880 --> 16:17.921
-No!
-Yes! The dodgy casting.

16:18.255 --> 16:19.671
-Oh, yeah?
-You don't get it.

16:19.755 --> 16:21.630
I'm going to "oops" all over the world!

16:21.963 --> 16:22.880
Hello!

16:22.963 --> 16:25.630
-Long live the king! Champagne!
-Thanks, Anita.

16:25.963 --> 16:27.296
That's awesome.

16:27.796 --> 16:29.046
A one-year contract.

16:29.130 --> 16:32.838
Not enough for a new life
but enough for us to have a fresh start.

16:33.171 --> 16:35.588
-For us?
-We're family!

16:36.046 --> 16:38.338
Yes, but no, absolutely not.

16:38.421 --> 16:40.796
It's non-negotiable, man.
It's the least I can do.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.463
By the way,
did you know Elsa came to the bar?

16:43.546 --> 16:44.796
-Elsa?
-No...

16:44.880 --> 16:47.005
The reason he stopped...

16:48.088 --> 16:49.755
-For the...
-Where is this girl?

16:50.588 --> 16:51.588
Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires.

16:53.296 --> 16:54.130
Brazil.

16:55.171 --> 16:56.755
Yep. She's leaving tonight.

16:57.380 --> 17:00.296
I checked. Her flight is at 23:54.
What's the plan?

17:01.296 --> 17:02.546
A good last impression?

17:04.005 --> 17:05.671
The Pink Cars concept

17:05.755 --> 17:07.713
is basically taxis for women by women.

17:51.630 --> 17:52.630
Good evening. Good evening.

17:58.713 --> 17:59.963
Did you order a pizza?

18:00.046 --> 18:01.671
-No, did you?
-No.

18:05.421 --> 18:06.880
I think Elsa has forgiven you.

18:24.380 --> 18:26.213
-Jules.
-Good evening.

18:26.296 --> 18:28.796
Listen, I'm sorry, Elsa's already left.

18:30.963 --> 18:31.963
Yes...

18:34.505 --> 18:37.838
OK, she's going to kill me
but there's a Buenos Aires in Paris too.

18:38.338 --> 18:39.338
I don't get it.

18:40.838 --> 18:42.255
You didn't hear this from me.

18:43.338 --> 18:44.838
But you can still catch her.

21:20.796 --> 21:22.546
BUENOS AIRES STREET
