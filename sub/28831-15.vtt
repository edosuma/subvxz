00:06.120 --> 00:07.290
Oh my God!

00:07.290 --> 00:09.000
Jamie's gonna ask
you to marry him.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
No!

00:12.040 --> 00:14.250
I'm not sure if I'm
reading this wrong, but--

00:15.290 --> 00:17.880
I just got out of something.
I'm not even sure

00:17.880 --> 00:19.120
if I am totally
out of it.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.920
Callie:
I'm gonna move
back in with Mariana.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.120
I'm her new
roommate, Isabella.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.120
-So, you just moved her in here?
-We just have so much in common.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.210
-You into magic?
-I don't usually tell people.

00:27.210 --> 00:29.420
-Don't wanna add
to the nerd factor.
-Nerds are sexy.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.830
(moaning)

00:32.790 --> 00:35.040
Alice:
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think you two are in love.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.040
Do you love Davia?

00:36.040 --> 00:37.250
Who wants to know?

00:38.710 --> 00:41.830
-(music blasting)
-(party chatter)

00:41.830 --> 00:43.790
(cheering, clapping)

00:45.000 --> 00:46.380
Never have I ever.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.420
-(groans)
-Not another one.

00:48.420 --> 00:50.040
Yes! Another one!

00:50.040 --> 00:51.330
(laughter)

00:51.330 --> 00:54.080
Been in love with
someone in this room.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.210
(thunder rumbles)

00:55.210 --> 00:57.080
-(awkward murmuring)
-Um...

00:57.080 --> 00:59.040
Davia:
Come on. If you've ever been
in love, you gotta drink.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.120
Aw...

01:02.120 --> 01:03.710
(rain falling)

01:09.460 --> 01:10.750
What is love?

01:11.290 --> 01:14.080
Is it a fruit in
season all the time?

01:14.080 --> 01:16.000
Is it a flower
always in bloom?

01:16.620 --> 01:18.960
Is love eternal?
Is love immortal?

01:18.960 --> 01:21.420
(laughing)
What is love?

01:22.250 --> 01:24.460
Love is what
lifts us up.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.040
It's a mountain high.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.080

04:47.420 --> 04:49.080
Well, it is Valentine's Day.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.000
Yeah, but she's all
about Jamie now.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.830
-She could care less about me.
-Maybe you two

04:53.830 --> 04:56.210
just need to talk.
Have a little heart to heart?

04:56.210 --> 04:58.920
He's taking her to 71 Above.
How do I compete with that?

04:58.920 --> 05:00.880
I hear it's very romantic.
You know, actually,

05:00.880 --> 05:02.540
a few of my friends have
gotten engaged there.

05:03.460 --> 05:04.750

-Mm-hmm.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.080
-Not great.
-Yeah.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.580
Okay, so you're
clearly over Jeff.

05:23.580 --> 05:25.830
When are you gonna tell
Dennis how you really feel?

05:25.830 --> 05:27.120
Never.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.000
We're better off as friends.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.420
Hey!

05:35.420 --> 05:37.460
Are we going to
a meeting tonight?

05:42.460 --> 05:45.790

05:54.080 --> 05:55.290
Hi.

05:55.290 --> 05:56.540
♪ Hey ♪

05:57.420 --> 06:00.040
I just wanted to say that
I'm so sorry for your loss.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.710
I'm sure your son
was very special.

06:02.710 --> 06:05.750
Oh, no. I'm...
I'm not Jacob's mother.

06:06.380 --> 06:07.920
Oh!

06:07.920 --> 06:10.290
I'm sorry. I assumed
she was your wife.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.500
No.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.040
-I'm just here as a friend.
-Susan: Mmm.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.540
Yeah, of course.
You...

06:21.540 --> 06:23.210
You don't need
me tagging along.

06:23.210 --> 06:25.500
Well, it just might
be easier to...

06:25.500 --> 06:27.250
talk about
some things...

06:27.250 --> 06:29.960
If I wasn't there.
I totally get it.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.960
Ugh, God. Paul is

06:37.960 --> 06:39.290
still on here.

06:39.710 --> 06:40.960
Dennis:
On what?

06:42.120 --> 06:44.170
Oh, um...

06:44.170 --> 06:46.290
Shyppr.
It's a dating app.

06:47.170 --> 06:48.580
Gotta get back in the saddle.

06:48.580 --> 06:50.080
Not this saddle, though.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.880
I'm looking for something
a little more mustang

06:51.880 --> 06:52.880
and a little less...

06:53.330 --> 06:54.460
Shetland pony.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.380
Oh. Gotta go.

07:03.080 --> 07:03.920
Hey.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.040
If you like,
love,

07:06.040 --> 07:08.620
or heart Davia, you better
make a move. Quick,

07:08.620 --> 07:10.040
before she like, loves,

07:10.040 --> 07:11.880
or hearts
someone else.

07:13.380 --> 07:14.380
Have a nice day.

07:15.540 --> 07:17.120
-Hey, Davia?
-Yeah?

07:17.120 --> 07:18.420
Um...

07:19.210 --> 07:21.880
Maybe... you wanna
grab dinner tonight?

07:23.120 --> 07:24.790
It's Valentine's Day,
Dennis.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.420
How about an anti-
Valentine's Day dinner?

07:30.580 --> 07:31.580
Sure.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.250
Huh? I'll take it.

07:40.750 --> 07:43.620
(traffic noise)

07:45.500 --> 07:47.540
Davia. (clears throat)

07:47.540 --> 07:48.580
Davia.

07:49.460 --> 07:51.120
Davia. Davia?

07:54.040 --> 07:55.670
Davia, I love you.

07:55.670 --> 07:57.120
-(slapping)
-(laugh)

07:57.120 --> 07:58.620
I wanna be with you.

07:58.620 --> 08:00.040
(scoff) I...

08:01.790 --> 08:03.880
I can't imagine
living without you.

08:04.380 --> 08:06.540
I love you.

08:13.540 --> 08:16.000
Okay, so should I go
with the techy present,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.670
the sexy present,
or the romantic present?

08:18.670 --> 08:20.920
You're nerds.
Go with the techy present.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.080
No. Sexy all the way.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.250
Hold up.
It's Valentine's Day.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.040
Definitely go with
the romantic one.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.460
Why don't you give
him all three?

08:27.460 --> 08:29.620
-(excited murmuring)
-You came!

08:29.620 --> 08:31.210
-Alice: Hi, Callie!
-Callie: Hi.

08:32.620 --> 08:35.000
-Yeah, but definitely
don't do all three.
-Definitely don't do that.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.290
Yeah, that'll be obvious that
you didn't know what to get him.

08:37.290 --> 08:38.960
Isabella:
Just go with your gut, Mariana.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.040
No one knows Raj
better than you do.

08:41.040 --> 08:44.250
Okay. Well, since we
just said the L word,

08:44.250 --> 08:45.960
my gut says...

08:45.960 --> 08:47.250
-...go romantic.
-Malika: Thank you.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.120
Uh, when did this happen?

08:49.120 --> 08:51.250
Oh, well, Raj said
it first, of course,

08:51.250 --> 08:52.670
and then,

08:52.670 --> 08:54.380
I said it back
the night of my launch.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.380
(giggle)

08:56.380 --> 08:58.210
I'm so happy you
could make it, Callie.

08:58.210 --> 09:00.330
-Oh.
-Malika: Yeah, we miss you.

09:00.330 --> 09:02.880
But, you know what?
Shout out to Isabella

09:02.880 --> 09:05.790
-for planning this.
-Mariana: Cheers to that.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.830
Okay, wait. This...
this is really funny.

09:09.830 --> 09:11.210
(phones buzzing)

09:11.210 --> 09:12.670
(ding)

09:12.670 --> 09:14.000
(laughter)

09:14.000 --> 09:16.380
-Pizza. (laugh)
-So good.

09:16.380 --> 09:18.120
(laughter)

09:27.710 --> 09:30.920
Did we have a Coterie group
thread when I lived here?

09:31.620 --> 09:34.080
-No. This is new.
-I don't remember one.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.580
(all denying)

09:36.580 --> 09:38.670
No, I get
drunk a lot.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.000
So what you said
about Raj, that,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.040
of course, he told you
he loved you first.

09:43.420 --> 09:45.920
Are you supposed to wait for
the guy to say it before you do?

09:45.920 --> 09:47.170
-Oh, duh.
-Yeah.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.460
You can't say it first
or they freak out.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.080
I love you.

09:59.170 --> 10:01.170
Okay, I don't think
that's a rule.

10:01.170 --> 10:02.670
Jamie told
you first.

10:03.120 --> 10:06.000
Joey said they were falling
in love with me first,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.040
but then we ended in a crash,
and now I'm gonna die alone.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.620
Maybe they weren't
the right person.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.500
But they're the one
that I want.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.290
Well, you can't always
have the one that you want.

10:15.790 --> 10:18.500
Sometimes, you gotta know
when it's time to move on.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.710
(typing)

10:19.710 --> 10:21.000
Are you texting them?

10:22.080 --> 10:24.000
Mm-mmm. You're not
getting this back

10:24.000 --> 10:25.710
until you accept
that it is over.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.580
I told Isaac I loved him first
and he didn't say it back yet.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.790
-Alice: Oh.
-Davia: Oh...

10:31.790 --> 10:33.460
But, he didn't freak
out or anything.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.120
Well, yet.

10:36.710 --> 10:39.120
I suppose there
are exceptions.

10:39.120 --> 10:40.920
-(door opens, shuts)
-(nervous chuckle)

10:41.830 --> 10:43.540
-Alice: You're fine.
-Malika: Oh!

10:43.540 --> 10:45.290
Okay, look at you!

10:45.290 --> 10:48.040
(excited murmuring)

10:48.040 --> 10:50.290
We're supposed to have
an anti-Valentine's dinner,

10:50.290 --> 10:53.330
but I was thinking fast casual.

10:53.330 --> 10:55.830
Oh... I could change.

10:55.830 --> 10:58.500
No! No, no, no.
You look very handsome.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.380
Doesn't he, Davia,

10:59.380 --> 11:01.210
look very handsome?

11:02.540 --> 11:05.000
Okay, he just combed his hair.
Don't get all hot and bothered.

11:05.380 --> 11:07.080
Look, I'm actually
already drunk.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.880
Can we just order in?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.460
-Yeah.
-Don't you wanna

11:11.460 --> 11:13.210
go out and...

11:13.210 --> 11:14.960
No. It's supposed to rain.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.250
Hey, um,

11:18.250 --> 11:19.960
when the guys get
here, can we talk?

11:20.880 --> 11:22.420
-Of course.
-Okay.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.330
Can I get you a drink?

11:30.330 --> 11:31.750
Oh, have you met Dennis?

11:31.750 --> 11:34.960
-Uh, I'm Isabella.
Mariana's new roommate.
-Oh my God.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.080
Both:
Nice to meet you.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.620
Uh, what loft do you live in?

11:37.620 --> 11:39.040
-I'm downstairs.
-How nice.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.000
Davia: You know what, maybe
I was being too hard on Paul.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.750
He was actually pretty
good in bed, and...

11:45.790 --> 11:47.210
worth at least a booty call.

11:48.580 --> 11:50.040
(gulping)

12:02.170 --> 12:03.380
So, you were right.

12:12.170 --> 12:13.040
(tapping)

12:16.330 --> 12:18.920
I think Jamie's going
to propose tonight.

12:29.580 --> 12:30.580
(sigh)

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Wow.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.670
I love your work.

12:38.420 --> 12:41.040
-Yeah, I wish I did.
-You don't?

12:41.040 --> 12:43.380
Not lately. Just...

12:43.380 --> 12:44.710
been a little blocked.

12:44.710 --> 12:46.210
This have anything
to do with that person

12:46.210 --> 12:48.210
you may or may not
have broken up with?

12:49.540 --> 12:50.960
Yeah, maybe.

12:51.290 --> 12:54.330
It's kinda been a shit
year for relationships.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.040
I feel that.

13:01.670 --> 13:03.170
Have you ever tried shrooms?

13:03.710 --> 13:05.210
Like the magic kind?

13:05.880 --> 13:07.170
Yes.

13:07.540 --> 13:08.960
No.

13:10.120 --> 13:13.000
I have. Just
a couple times, and...

13:13.000 --> 13:16.420
I just remember they
made me feel so creative

13:16.420 --> 13:18.620
and free, like...

13:19.250 --> 13:21.670
all my walls were just dropped.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.960
Anyways, if you're
interested, I know a guy.

13:34.210 --> 13:35.000
(chuckle)

13:56.120 --> 13:57.120
(chuckling)

14:01.080 --> 14:03.960
-(music playing)
-(party chatter)

14:05.250 --> 14:06.080
(door shuts)

14:06.080 --> 14:07.710
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

14:10.670 --> 14:12.040
-Hi.
-Hey.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.790
(moaning)

14:15.420 --> 14:18.080
Oh, what beautiful flowers!

14:18.540 --> 14:20.210
Thank you.
They're for Mariana.

14:20.210 --> 14:21.750
Is she here? Mariana?

14:21.750 --> 14:24.460
Uh, she's having a little
sister talk with Callie.

14:24.460 --> 14:27.210
-You must be Jamie.
-You must be Isabella.

14:27.210 --> 14:28.420
Why don't I go put
these in water?

14:29.290 --> 14:31.830
-Oh... Cool.
-Okay.

14:36.210 --> 14:37.210
What?

14:37.790 --> 14:38.830
Nothing.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.000
I was looking through
Jamie's drawers,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.250
and the ring was gone.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.000
Maybe he moved it.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.710
Hid it better so you
wouldn't find it.

14:47.710 --> 14:51.040
Or maybe he's planning
on proposing tonight

14:51.040 --> 14:52.960
at the proposal restaurant.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.670
If you're not ready to be
engaged, just tell him.

14:54.670 --> 14:56.420
And humiliate him in front
of the whole restaurant?

14:56.420 --> 14:58.040
Then tell him before dinner!

14:58.040 --> 15:00.120
Oh, that while I was
looking through his drawers,

15:00.120 --> 15:02.380
I noticed that the ring,
that my sister found

15:02.380 --> 15:04.120
while she was looking through
his drawers, was gone?

15:04.540 --> 15:07.080
You know, just in case he was
planning on proposing tonight.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.000
And what if he's not
planning on doing it tonight?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.750
Then-- then I've
ruined the surprise!

15:10.750 --> 15:12.790
A surprise you don't
wanna be surprised by.

15:13.750 --> 15:15.170
Look, I don't know
what to tell you,

15:15.170 --> 15:17.710
but Raj is probably here,
and I need to go back out.

15:22.290 --> 15:24.580
(party chatter)

15:24.580 --> 15:27.210
-You have to try at least one.
-Oh...

15:27.210 --> 15:28.790
-Raj!
-Hey!

15:28.790 --> 15:30.000
-(spill)
-Mariana: Oh!

15:31.290 --> 15:33.830
-You look nice.
-You do, too. (chuckle)

15:33.830 --> 15:36.040
You just spilled a little bit.

15:36.040 --> 15:38.210
-Right, I got it!
-(chuckle)

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Look what Raj
brought you.

15:43.170 --> 15:45.790
Oh my gosh!
They're beautiful.

15:45.790 --> 15:48.170
-Aw. Truly are.
-Oh, thanks.

15:48.790 --> 15:50.790
-Hey!
-Hi!

15:51.380 --> 15:53.000
Hi.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.120
What you doing?

16:03.420 --> 16:05.210
Can't I feel up
my boyfriend?

16:05.210 --> 16:08.000
-Are you drunk?
-A little.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.040
Uh, pace yourself.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.710
I have a big night
planned for us.

16:11.710 --> 16:12.960
Hm!

16:14.040 --> 16:15.290
(door opens)

16:19.250 --> 16:21.120
Hey, you.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.250
-These are for you.
-Aw,

16:22.250 --> 16:23.380
thank you.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.250
-(indistinct)
-(kissing)

16:26.250 --> 16:28.080
(party chatter continues)

16:28.080 --> 16:29.960
I'm not-- I'm not
really up for all this.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.040
Oh. Yeah, it's almost over.
Everyone's going

16:32.040 --> 16:34.040
their separate ways, and then
we can have our night in.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.750
Okay. Uh, I'm wrapping up
a business thing. Can...

16:37.750 --> 16:38.960
can I make a call in your room?

16:39.540 --> 16:40.540
Yeah, of course.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.420
Okay, cool.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.040
(laughter)

16:48.920 --> 16:51.000
Gael:
It's kinda been a shit
year for relationships.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.000
Bryan:
You were shut off
from the start!

16:54.000 --> 16:55.710
Until you figure that out,

16:55.710 --> 16:57.040
the only thing
I do know

16:57.040 --> 16:59.120
is that you won't
be right for anyone.

17:00.460 --> 17:02.540
Gael:
Maybe this whole time,

17:02.540 --> 17:04.250
all I needed is you.

17:05.330 --> 17:07.120
Callie:
What, I'm like your muse?

17:07.920 --> 17:10.710
I'll never pass the bar
if I'm up here every night.

17:12.210 --> 17:14.000
I was trying
to help you.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.460
Compromising your principles

17:15.460 --> 17:17.290
might be the world's
idea of success,

17:17.290 --> 17:18.460
but it's not mine,

17:18.460 --> 17:19.920
and it's not
who I wanna be,

17:19.920 --> 17:21.710
and it's not who
I wanna be with.

17:21.710 --> 17:23.080
So you're saying we're done?

17:24.290 --> 17:26.000
I'm seeing
Jamie again.

17:29.210 --> 17:30.880
(inhale)

17:35.120 --> 17:36.080
(yell)

17:41.170 --> 17:42.000
(sniffle)

18:03.170 --> 18:05.170
(hissing)

18:05.170 --> 18:07.170
(thunder)

18:07.170 --> 18:08.210
(scream)

18:09.420 --> 18:11.290
That was awesome!

18:13.210 --> 18:14.620
-(clicking)
-(scream)

18:14.620 --> 18:16.040
(gasping)

18:18.750 --> 18:20.080
Is this really happening?

18:21.210 --> 18:22.790
(thunder)

18:25.380 --> 18:27.580
Don't leave candles unattended.

18:27.580 --> 18:29.080
Sorry. Sorry about that.

18:29.080 --> 18:32.460
-Looks like a transformer blew.
-Yeah, the lights are
out all over the city.

18:32.460 --> 18:36.170
-They're saying stay put.
-Looks like we're not gonna
make our dinner reservation.

18:38.170 --> 18:40.170
-(flickering)
-Dude, you okay?

18:41.170 --> 18:44.250
I didn't know light was
made of tiny little dancers.

18:44.250 --> 18:47.580
-Is he on something?
-I may have hooked him
up with some shrooms.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.580
-It's so beautiful.
-Don't touch.

18:50.580 --> 18:52.080
-Can I have some of what he had?
-No!

18:53.000 --> 18:54.120
You're no fun!

18:54.500 --> 18:56.830
Hey, since no one can
go anywhere tonight,

18:56.830 --> 18:58.960
who wants to play
a drinking game?

18:58.960 --> 19:02.170
(cheering)

19:04.750 --> 19:08.170
(muffled chatter)

19:08.170 --> 19:09.540
(raining)

19:10.290 --> 19:11.500
Malika:
Hey...

19:13.000 --> 19:14.080
(muffled laughter)

19:16.670 --> 19:17.670
Hello?

19:18.620 --> 19:20.120
Hey. Hey.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.170
What are you
listening to?

19:21.170 --> 19:22.620
Uh, nothing.
I'm just...

19:22.620 --> 19:24.880
-I'm canceling
the noise out there.
-Oh, lemme see.

19:27.080 --> 19:29.080
-(silence)
-Oh...

19:29.080 --> 19:31.080
-(noise comes back)
-These are dope.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.120
Yeah. Uh, your internet's down.

19:34.120 --> 19:35.420
I'm sure the client
will understand

19:35.420 --> 19:36.620
that you can't
work in a blackout.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.880
Why don't you let
me help you relax?

19:40.420 --> 19:43.210
You know, why don't we, uh,
join the party out there?

19:43.210 --> 19:44.960
I could really use a drink.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.830
(thunder rumbling)

19:48.540 --> 19:51.330
Never have I ever
pierced my nipples.

19:51.330 --> 19:54.210
(laughter)

19:54.210 --> 19:55.540
Jamie:
Alright, never have I ever

19:55.540 --> 19:57.040
lived with more
than five people.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.540
(cheering)

20:00.040 --> 20:01.460
I felt up Jamie's pockets.

20:01.460 --> 20:04.290
Doesn't have a ring box on him,
so that's a good sign.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.620
What if he left
it in the car?

20:06.620 --> 20:08.210
(thunder)

20:11.880 --> 20:13.250
Never have
I ever...

20:13.250 --> 20:15.040
peed in our pool.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.500
(thunder)

20:17.620 --> 20:20.170
-Seriously?
-Well, that's what
the chlorine is for, shh.

20:20.170 --> 20:22.000
Never have
I ever...

20:22.000 --> 20:24.620
dated someone who
ended up being gay.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.170
I'm gonna take
a half sip.

20:26.170 --> 20:27.750
(laughter)

20:27.750 --> 20:30.170
You didn't leave
anything valuable

20:30.170 --> 20:32.000
in your car,
did you?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.120
Uh, no.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.120
Nope, no.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.960
-Did you?
-No.

20:38.290 --> 20:40.120
-(chatter)
-(shrieking)

20:40.120 --> 20:42.210
Never have I ever...

20:42.210 --> 20:43.380
Thrown up in
a coat check.

20:43.380 --> 20:46.080
-You have!
-(laughing)

20:46.080 --> 20:47.500
All (chanting):

21:36.920 --> 21:39.210
Okay, well, maybe he dropped
it off at the restaurant

21:39.210 --> 21:41.210
so they can bake it into
a soufflé or something.

So, how was your
talk with Callie?

22:02.580 --> 22:05.210
She just wanted
to talk about Jamie.

22:05.210 --> 22:06.290
She's so obsessed about

22:06.290 --> 22:09.170
whether he has the ring or
he's gonna propose. Just...

22:09.170 --> 22:12.120
I wish she'd ask him
and just leave me out of it.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.080
Oh! Hey!

Oh!

(toilet flushing)

22:31.920 --> 22:32.750
Hey.

22:33.620 --> 22:34.830
(sigh)

22:38.380 --> 22:41.380
Hey, would you say it's,
uh, hypothetically,

22:41.380 --> 22:43.460
normal to, uh,

22:43.460 --> 22:45.040
I don't know...

22:45.040 --> 22:47.790
fantasize about another
woman during sex?

22:48.120 --> 22:50.080
Is the woman Mariana's
new roommate?

22:50.080 --> 22:51.710
(thunder)

23:01.170 --> 23:03.830
Look, a fantasy is
one thing, but...

23:03.830 --> 23:06.040
a fantasy motivated
by feelings?

23:07.790 --> 23:10.040
Mm... that's
dangerous territory.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.000
Isabella:
"Never have I ever..."

23:15.000 --> 23:16.380
Oh, it's blank.

23:17.460 --> 23:19.080
I don't know.

23:20.210 --> 23:23.170
Never have I ever...

23:23.710 --> 23:26.380
bought an engagement
ring for anyone.

23:29.420 --> 23:32.460
(thunder rumbling)

23:34.960 --> 23:37.460
-You told her about the ring?
-We live together.

23:37.460 --> 23:40.120
-She's bound to hear stuff.
-Okay, what other
personal things

23:40.120 --> 23:41.670
have you told
her about me?

23:41.670 --> 23:43.500
That I iron my sheets?

23:45.080 --> 23:47.960
I read the Coterie Biatches
text thread, Mariana.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.040
Is that why
you moved out?

23:51.000 --> 23:52.040
No.

23:52.040 --> 23:54.290
No, I moved out

23:54.290 --> 23:56.290
because I love Jamie.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.040
-Then why are you so
afraid to commit to him?
-I'm not!

24:00.040 --> 24:02.540
I-I committed to signing
a lease with him.

24:04.790 --> 24:06.380
(footsteps)

24:06.380 --> 24:08.580
Oh, hey. Uh, Isabella asked me

24:08.580 --> 24:10.670
about getting on the lease
with you. Something about

24:10.670 --> 24:12.620
her renter's insurance.
What do you think?

24:13.120 --> 24:15.790
So, that would mean
taking Callie off.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.290
Yeah.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.620
-Can we hold off for a while?
-Hm?

24:20.620 --> 24:22.420
I'll talk to Isabella.
You know, just in case

24:22.420 --> 24:24.210
Callie decides
to move back in.

24:24.210 --> 24:25.210
You think
she will?

24:26.040 --> 24:27.330
You never know.

24:27.330 --> 24:29.000
Well, good for you.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.040
Hope you give
him more notice

24:31.040 --> 24:32.380
when you suddenly
decide to move out

24:32.380 --> 24:35.210
-and break that lease.
-I didn't break our lease.

24:35.210 --> 24:37.540
I was still paying rent
when you suddenly decided

24:37.540 --> 24:38.960
to move Isabella in!

24:38.960 --> 24:41.380
You completely abandoned me!

24:41.380 --> 24:44.330
I wasn't the one making fun of
you behind your back, Mariana!

24:44.330 --> 24:46.080
Talk about
being abandoned!

24:46.080 --> 24:47.750
(thunder)

24:48.170 --> 24:50.420
-I gotta use the bathroom.
-Okay.

24:50.420 --> 24:53.420
(muffled music)

24:57.080 --> 24:59.250
(raining)

24:59.920 --> 25:00.920
Where's Dennis?

25:02.120 --> 25:03.790
I think he had enough.
(chuckle)

25:03.790 --> 25:05.040
What?

25:07.880 --> 25:10.000
Okay. "Show us your
secret talent."

25:10.830 --> 25:13.080
Uh, I don't really have one.

25:13.080 --> 25:16.080
Ooh! Um, uh,
do your magic trick.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.920
I don't even have it. Oh,
I do have a quarter. Alright.

25:18.920 --> 25:21.000
-Everyone take a look.
-(thunder)

25:22.790 --> 25:25.750
(mystical music)

25:25.750 --> 25:27.080
Jamie:
Whoa!

25:27.080 --> 25:28.670
(applause)

25:28.670 --> 25:30.290
And it's back.

25:30.290 --> 25:32.500
(cheering)

25:32.500 --> 25:35.330
How did I not know
that he was into magic?

25:35.330 --> 25:37.500
I mean, I obviously
don't know him at all.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.210
I'm a terrible
girlfriend.

25:39.210 --> 25:41.120
All of my Valentine's Day
presents suck.

25:41.120 --> 25:44.000
It's okay. No one knows
everything about anyone.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.620
But something
as big as magic?

25:47.670 --> 25:49.420
(sob)
This is huge.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.920
I can't give Raj one of those
stupid gifts that I bought him.

25:52.920 --> 25:54.920
I mean... (gasp)

25:54.920 --> 25:57.380
He gave me the first
line of code for my app,

25:58.040 --> 26:00.210
and I got him
edible underwear!

26:01.080 --> 26:03.500
What's wrong with me?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.500
Okay. I was gonna
give this to Raj

26:06.500 --> 26:08.250
as a thank you for helping
me put my shelves together,

26:08.250 --> 26:10.920
but you should give it to him.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.080
"The Magic Book"

26:18.080 --> 26:19.620

Just, uh...

26:41.620 --> 26:43.000
taking a break.

26:45.580 --> 26:47.960
Look, if I freaked you out
by saying I love you,

26:47.960 --> 26:49.830
just be honest.

26:50.580 --> 26:53.290
You're not there,
that's fine. Just don't...

26:53.290 --> 26:55.210

Valentine's Day

Aw.

Glad you liked it.

(door shuts)

30:12.290 --> 30:13.500
Feeling better?

30:15.120 --> 30:16.540
Yeah. Sometimes, I...

30:18.000 --> 30:19.620
my chest gets tight,

30:19.620 --> 30:22.080
and my head starts spinning
with all these negative thoughts

30:22.080 --> 30:23.460
of what could happen,

30:23.460 --> 30:26.080
and I can't breathe.

30:28.290 --> 30:30.670
And so, I just
need to be alone

30:30.670 --> 30:32.170
and hold on
until it passes.

30:32.790 --> 30:34.790
How long has this
been happening?

30:39.380 --> 30:40.620
Since I was a kid.

30:41.790 --> 30:44.580
But I get through it,
you know? It's fine.

30:45.040 --> 30:47.170
Have you ever talked to
anyone about anxiety?

30:48.040 --> 30:49.120
Look, I know some
people think that

30:49.120 --> 30:52.210
mental health is something
to be ashamed of, but it's not.

30:52.210 --> 30:54.170
You don't have to hold on.

30:54.880 --> 30:56.330
You can get help.

30:59.380 --> 31:01.620
Why do you think I
haven't said I loved you?

31:04.670 --> 31:05.920
'Cause you haven't.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.670
I said you're my girl.

31:07.670 --> 31:10.080
-That does not spell I love you.
-But you know.

31:11.120 --> 31:14.580
I can't read your mind!
Women need to hear the words.

31:14.580 --> 31:17.580
You need to open your mouth
and speak your feelings.

31:17.580 --> 31:19.290
-Speak my feelings.
-Yeah.

31:20.620 --> 31:21.750
It's okay.

31:21.750 --> 31:23.290
Well, read my lips then.

31:23.290 --> 31:24.500
Look. Look.

33:38.210 --> 33:40.380
I never fit in

33:40.380 --> 33:42.380
Yeah, because you
never made an effort!

33:42.380 --> 33:43.880

I did make an effort.

I'm sorry I can't just

-Okay, that's not fair.

33:49.620 --> 33:51.830
She's just trying to
make friends and...

33:51.830 --> 33:53.620
At least she's not
holed up at work,

33:53.620 --> 33:55.420
or at her boyfriend's
apartment all day.

33:55.420 --> 33:57.620
Well, at least I wasn't talking
shit about you behind your back.

33:57.620 --> 34:00.330

you don't like me.

happened to Stevie Nicks?

36:14.290 --> 36:17.290
I don't wanna get old.
Oh my God. I'm gonna get old.

36:18.290 --> 36:21.460
And die. (laughing)

36:21.460 --> 36:24.500
(cackling)

36:24.500 --> 36:26.580
-Just focus on me.
-(chuckle)

36:28.670 --> 36:30.580
I love clouds.

36:30.580 --> 36:32.580
(laughing)

36:32.580 --> 36:34.000
(sobbing)

36:34.000 --> 36:36.120
Is it gonna be
this dark forever?!

36:37.210 --> 36:39.080
The sun will be up soon.

36:57.080 --> 37:00.290
So, um, my friend,

37:00.290 --> 37:02.330
the woman that's been
coming here with me.

37:02.330 --> 37:04.920
-The one who pockets
the coffee creamer?
-(chuckling)

37:04.920 --> 37:06.040
Yeah...

37:07.080 --> 37:09.000
Sorry about that.
(laugh)

37:09.000 --> 37:10.290
Um...

37:12.540 --> 37:15.500
So, I'm in love with her
and I wanna tell her.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.210
But, um,

37:17.210 --> 37:20.080
Jacob's mother,
my ex-wife, she's pregnant

37:20.080 --> 37:22.120
and getting married
again, and...

37:22.420 --> 37:24.670
I think, um,
maybe I feel

37:24.670 --> 37:27.670
guilty for, um...

37:28.170 --> 37:30.170
Also moving on with life?

37:31.580 --> 37:34.790
I just feel like
somebody has to,

37:34.790 --> 37:38.580
you know, grieve our son.

37:39.120 --> 37:41.000
I think we can all
relate to that feeling.

37:42.170 --> 37:43.880
Like, we have to stop living

37:43.880 --> 37:46.290
in order to honor
the person we lost,

37:46.290 --> 37:47.920
especially a child.

37:48.920 --> 37:51.080
Yeah, she's really
been there for me.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.170
Davia, you know?

37:55.170 --> 37:57.920
I couldn't have done
this without her.

37:59.250 --> 38:01.460
I might not even be
here without her.

38:01.460 --> 38:02.880
Sam:
When my wife died,

38:02.880 --> 38:05.580
her best friend was
really there for me.

38:07.170 --> 38:08.750
I thought I was
in love with her.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.210
We got involved.

38:12.210 --> 38:14.080
And then,

38:14.080 --> 38:15.790
when I started coming here

38:16.210 --> 38:19.080
and getting better,
I realized that...

38:19.580 --> 38:21.830
-I loved her as a friend...
-Mm-hmm.

38:21.830 --> 38:24.750
but not as someone

38:24.750 --> 38:27.750
that I wanted to be in
a romantic relationship with.

38:30.380 --> 38:33.250
Ended up really hurting her,

38:33.750 --> 38:35.420
and I should've
taken more time

38:36.080 --> 38:38.120
and been more careful
with her feelings.

38:38.120 --> 38:40.290
Susan:
Well, it's hard
in a state of grief

38:40.290 --> 38:44.000
to know the difference
between need and love.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.170
That's why it's
best not to start

38:46.170 --> 38:47.710
any new relationship
too soon.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.580
So, you were gone a while.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.710
Did you go all the way to
New York for these bagels?

38:56.880 --> 38:58.170
I went to a meeting.

38:58.170 --> 39:01.000
Was it easier to talk about
things without me there?

39:01.000 --> 39:02.210
I guess.

39:05.460 --> 39:08.040
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.000
I understand.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.040
-(clears throat)
-Callie: What's the verdict?

39:17.580 --> 39:19.710
-Uh, broken wrist.
-Raj: Oh.

39:20.080 --> 39:22.580
I could make some
more breakfast if...

39:22.580 --> 39:25.000
Uh, no thank you.
Uh, we grabbed something.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.250
Yep, uh...

39:27.210 --> 39:29.670
-Ready to go?
-Yeah.

39:30.830 --> 39:33.380
-(grunt)
-Thank you for the most...

39:34.290 --> 39:36.120
interesting Valentine's Day
in recent memory.

39:37.580 --> 39:40.750
-See you later. Next time,
we'll stick the landing.
-(laugh)

39:43.210 --> 39:45.620
-High five! Okay.
-(laugh)

39:45.620 --> 39:46.620
I'm heading up.

39:47.210 --> 39:49.000
-Feel better, man.
-Thanks.

39:54.170 --> 39:55.920
Hey, so, uh,

39:55.920 --> 39:59.040
I talked to Alice about your
renter's insurance, and...

39:59.500 --> 40:01.380
I think we should
just sign a new lease.

40:01.750 --> 40:04.210
Great. Thanks.

40:04.210 --> 40:06.330
-I'm gonna go take a shower.
-Okay.

40:06.330 --> 40:08.040
Isabella:
Oh, your Valentine's Day
present!

40:10.000 --> 40:11.170
How is it? (sigh)

40:12.170 --> 40:14.880
It's amazing.
I love it.

40:15.540 --> 40:16.670
I thought you would.

40:18.710 --> 40:20.040
You thought I would?

40:20.830 --> 40:22.620
I was just helping
Mariana brainstorm,

40:22.620 --> 40:24.670
and I know you're
into magic, so...

40:24.670 --> 40:26.710

Jamie, I love
you so much,

40:40.000 --> 40:41.920
but I am not ready
to get engaged.

40:41.920 --> 40:44.120
Uh, okay.

40:44.120 --> 40:46.120
That came outta
left field.

40:46.960 --> 40:50.540
I... I was looking
for some socks, and...

40:51.080 --> 40:53.080
I saw the engagement ring

40:53.080 --> 40:55.960
-in the drawer.
-Oh...

40:55.960 --> 40:59.040
We haven't even discussed
getting married.

40:59.040 --> 41:02.080
-I know, I know.
-Then why would you
buy a ring? (laugh)

41:02.080 --> 41:03.040
(sigh)

41:03.620 --> 41:05.080
I, uh...

41:06.500 --> 41:08.170
I didn't buy
that ring for you.

41:10.170 --> 41:12.420
It was meant for
my ex, Heather.

41:13.750 --> 41:14.750
Oh.

41:16.670 --> 41:18.210
Did you propose
to Heather?

41:19.080 --> 41:21.040
-Yeah.
-What happened?

41:21.040 --> 41:23.210
She said no.
