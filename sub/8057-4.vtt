00:00.361 --> 00:02.081
Mr. Haverford, on the morning of your crash

00:02.082 --> 00:03.681
- were you alone in your car?
- Yes.

00:03.801 --> 00:05.121
Your Honor, this was an accident.

00:05.122 --> 00:07.846
Plain and simple. I don't want to put
words in your mouth but...

00:08.100 --> 00:08.933
case dismissed.

00:09.053 --> 00:10.733
And you were texting at the time, correct?

00:10.734 --> 00:11.872
How dare you, sir?

00:11.992 --> 00:12.868
I was tweeting.

00:12.988 --> 00:14.141
Please, read Exhibit C,

00:14.261 --> 00:17.515
the transcript of your Twitter page
leading to the immediatelly following crash.

00:17.635 --> 00:21.057
"9:15. Four green lights in a row. #blessed"

00:21.177 --> 00:26.252
"9:17. Drive faster, blue Civic.
Daaaaaamn. #soccermoms"

00:26.372 --> 00:29.832
"9:18. Gotta pass this lady
on the 'ejkerkj'."

00:29.866 --> 00:31.450
That's when I hit the fire hydrant.

00:31.501 --> 00:34.620
Sorry, allegedly hit the fire hydrant.

00:34.671 --> 00:37.406
"9:20. Just hit a fire hydrant,
but I survived.

00:37.424 --> 00:39.208
"#unbreakable.

00:39.242 --> 00:41.420
"#what'sMr. Glassuptothesedays?

00:41.540 --> 00:43.412

00:43.430 --> 00:45.848
Prosecution rests, Your Honor.

00:45.882 --> 00:47.600
Mr. Haverford,
you have a problem

00:47.634 --> 00:48.968
keeping your eyes on the road

00:49.019 --> 00:50.593
and off your electronic devices.

00:50.713 --> 00:53.606
I'm going to tailor
a punishment to fit the crime.

00:53.640 --> 00:55.558
One week without screens.

00:55.592 --> 00:58.792
No phone, tablets,
computers, television... anything.

00:58.912 --> 01:00.407
No! Please,
send me to jail!

01:00.527 --> 01:03.199
Any slipups,
and that week becomes a month.

01:03.233 --> 01:04.400
Turn in your phone, please.

01:04.434 --> 01:05.874
[Bangs gavel]
Fine. One last tweet?

01:05.875 --> 01:07.787
Bailiff!

01:07.821 --> 01:10.272
Pr-press send, bailiff!
Press send!

01:30.477 --> 01:31.644
Howdy.

01:31.678 --> 01:33.512
Hey!
What's with the get-up?

01:33.563 --> 01:35.523
I just got back from
that dude ranch with Ricky.

01:35.558 --> 01:37.638
It was really fun.
He bought this for me as a gift.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.769
A cowboy hat from your cowboyfriend.

01:39.803 --> 01:41.403
Oh, that makes it sound like he's a cow.

01:41.404 --> 01:43.773
From your cowboy boyfriend.
Your boycow-cowboy.

01:43.807 --> 01:45.574
- Just call him "Ricky."
- Okay, great.

01:45.609 --> 01:47.777
Okay, everyone.

01:47.811 --> 01:50.496
Great news: Lots of old people
have chlamydia.

01:50.530 --> 01:51.814
Whoo!

01:51.832 --> 01:54.033
Seniors in Pawnee have
a lot of time on their hands,

01:54.084 --> 01:55.584
and what they're doing with that time

01:55.619 --> 01:57.953
is going at it hard,
old people-style.

01:57.987 --> 02:00.172
A lot of them haven't
had proper sex education,

02:00.207 --> 02:03.092
and as a result,
STDs are having a field day.

02:03.126 --> 02:05.795
It's amazing what a few old guys can do

02:05.829 --> 02:08.330
with a little bit of charm
and a lot of crabs.

02:08.348 --> 02:09.882
Okay, sex avengers,

02:09.933 --> 02:12.134
these old fogies
are very set in their ways.

02:12.168 --> 02:14.020
They're hopped up
on E.D. medication

02:14.054 --> 02:15.605
and they got nothing to lose,

02:15.606 --> 02:16.806
'cause they're close to death.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.141
Also, seniors can be pretty ornery.

02:19.175 --> 02:21.811
Uh, actually, I think
it's pronounced "horny."

02:21.845 --> 02:24.513
I have an idea. Let's pretend
that we're old people,

02:24.531 --> 02:26.982
and we can ask Ann our grossest,

02:27.016 --> 02:28.818
most perverted sex questions.

02:28.852 --> 02:30.486
I'll start.
I'm an old lady,

02:30.520 --> 02:32.488
why do I need birth control?

02:32.522 --> 02:35.624
I haven't had my monthly
since LBJ was president.

02:35.659 --> 02:36.625
Well, with the elderly,

02:36.660 --> 02:38.661
we are not so concerned with pregnancy.

02:38.695 --> 02:40.463
We're more concerned with disease.

02:40.497 --> 02:42.865
Do pubic hairs get longer
the older you get?

02:42.883 --> 02:43.899
I don't think so, no.

02:43.934 --> 02:45.718
Because that's happening to me.

02:45.752 --> 02:47.336
What should I do?

02:47.370 --> 02:49.170
Where can I get lube
that is healthy to eat?

02:49.171 --> 02:52.007
I ran over my testicles
with my jazzy scooter.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.401
I think you're good to go, nursey.

02:53.402 --> 02:55.122
I want to jump on that caboose.
Choo choo!

02:55.145 --> 02:56.950
You should never eat lube,

02:56.951 --> 02:58.431
you need to see a doctor immediately,

02:58.482 --> 03:00.683
and I'm sorry, sir,
but you have to be under 40

03:00.717 --> 03:02.050
to ride this train.

03:02.069 --> 03:03.986
Oh!
That's how you do it, kids.

03:04.020 --> 03:05.354
- [Laughs]
- Nice.

03:05.388 --> 03:08.157
"LeRon James."
We still on for breakfast?

03:08.191 --> 03:10.242
You are an hour and a half late for work.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.495
Yeah. Sorry.
I can't use my GPS,

03:12.529 --> 03:13.913
but I figured it out.

03:13.947 --> 03:16.565
I just drove around in circles
until I saw something familiar.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.200
You live 3 miles from here.

03:18.234 --> 03:20.586
3.4,
according to my GPS,

03:20.587 --> 03:21.787
which I used to use every day.

03:21.838 --> 03:23.339
I can't use screens for a week.

03:23.373 --> 03:25.341
Big deal!
I'm adapting.

03:25.375 --> 03:28.377
I built a real-life
Pinterest board.

03:31.715 --> 03:33.849
I really wish you could click those.

03:33.884 --> 03:36.385
Wow, there he is, Barack Obama.

03:36.419 --> 03:37.899
His name is congressman David Murray,

03:37.900 --> 03:40.473
he is our boss and he is white.

03:40.524 --> 03:41.690
Don't embarrass me.

03:41.725 --> 03:43.258
Congressman Murray, I'm Ben Wyatt,

03:43.276 --> 03:45.093
coordinating director
of D.C. Operations.

03:45.112 --> 03:47.196
And I am April Blart, mall cop.

03:47.230 --> 03:49.565
Great! It's a pleasure
to finally meet you, Ben.

03:49.599 --> 03:51.266
Heard such great things.

03:51.284 --> 03:53.244
Oh, well, I really feel
like I know you already.

03:53.245 --> 03:55.125
I've watched all
of your speeches and debates.

03:55.126 --> 03:56.238
It's very inspiring.

03:56.272 --> 03:57.490
Thank you, Ben.

03:57.541 --> 03:59.792
And thank you all for your hard work.

03:59.826 --> 04:02.661
Now, stay cool.
It's a hot one out there today.

04:02.712 --> 04:03.792
- [Laughs]
- That's right,

04:03.793 --> 04:05.833
you could practically
cook an egg on the sidewalk.

04:05.834 --> 04:08.667
[Chuckles] Terrific.

04:09.886 --> 04:11.360
Okay, let's make sure we're ready

04:11.361 --> 04:12.721
for the strategy session tomorrow.

04:12.756 --> 04:14.056
- Okay.
- Okay?

04:14.090 --> 04:16.475
Hey, we're still
gonna assassinate him, right?

04:16.510 --> 04:19.094
- Don't say that.
- Ben!

04:23.400 --> 04:27.135
What the hell is he doing?

04:27.154 --> 04:29.972
Hello, can everyone hear me okay?

04:29.990 --> 04:31.357
All: No.

04:31.408 --> 04:33.168
Okay, great.
I'm councilwoman Leslie Knope,

04:33.193 --> 04:35.611
and today we are here
to talk about safe sex.

04:35.645 --> 04:37.646
I know this is a personal question,

04:37.664 --> 04:40.416
but how many of you out there
are sexually active?

04:40.450 --> 04:41.584
Oh, my.

04:41.618 --> 04:44.319
I have two partners,
often at the same time.

04:44.337 --> 04:45.788
Wow. Thank you.

04:45.822 --> 04:47.840
Does anyone know what we risk

04:47.874 --> 04:49.925
when we have unprotected sex?

04:49.960 --> 04:51.510
- Heart attack.
- Falling in love.

04:51.545 --> 04:53.161
Partner dies on top of you!

04:53.180 --> 04:55.181
Yes, but the truth is,

04:55.215 --> 04:56.765
the greatest risk you face

04:56.800 --> 04:58.717
is sexually transmitted diseases.

04:58.768 --> 05:01.136
Are these old people really
having sex with each other?

05:01.170 --> 05:02.730
Yeah, what'd you think they were doing?

05:02.765 --> 05:04.205
I don't know, I thought we were just

05:04.206 --> 05:05.474
talking about it.

05:05.508 --> 05:10.062
Oh!
[Disgusted laugh]

05:10.113 --> 05:12.531
And the best way to prevent
them is to use protection.

05:12.566 --> 05:14.149
Well, that's all fine and good,

05:14.183 --> 05:16.702
but what if the banana is soft and mushy,

05:16.736 --> 05:18.854
and doglegs sharply to the left?

05:18.872 --> 05:20.873
[Shudders]

05:25.695 --> 05:27.913
Oh, my God, Jerry,
when you check your email,

05:27.964 --> 05:30.866
you go to Altavista and type
"Please go to yahoo.com?"

05:30.884 --> 05:32.044
Well, how else would I do it?

05:32.058 --> 05:33.538
You don't have your email bookmarked?

05:33.539 --> 05:34.587
Do you have any bookmarks?

05:34.638 --> 05:36.038
What's bookmarks?

05:36.056 --> 05:38.757
God, Jerry!
You don't deserve the Internet!

05:38.808 --> 05:39.842
I'm going crazy, Ron!

05:39.876 --> 05:41.427
Life without screens is pointless.

05:41.478 --> 05:44.730
I made an iPhone out of paper.
It's not the same, though.

05:47.934 --> 05:49.768
This is the work of a lunatic.

05:49.819 --> 05:51.770
You need to detox.

05:51.821 --> 05:54.222
Tomorrow, we'll go
to my cabin in the woods.

05:54.241 --> 05:56.058
It's so far away from civilization,

05:56.076 --> 05:57.743
the electric company is not even aware

05:57.777 --> 05:58.894
there's a structure there.

05:58.912 --> 06:00.663
[Sighs] Thanks, Ron.

06:00.697 --> 06:02.998
And hey, can you give me
a ride after work?

06:03.033 --> 06:06.619
There's no chance I can find my way home.

06:06.670 --> 06:09.455
If you encounter this scenario,

06:09.506 --> 06:12.041
simply execute the following maneuver.

06:12.075 --> 06:14.677
And stop!

06:14.711 --> 06:16.411
Great job, and very informative,

06:16.429 --> 06:17.700
but we need to stop now forever

06:17.701 --> 06:19.181
and pretend like this never happened.

06:19.215 --> 06:20.248
Why?
What happening?

06:20.267 --> 06:22.718
[Mumbles incoherently]

06:22.752 --> 06:24.252
Oh, boy.

06:24.271 --> 06:25.921
Marcia and Marshall Langman

06:25.939 --> 06:27.806
are the town's morality watchdogs.

06:27.857 --> 06:31.226
Marcia is motivated,
calculating, and hyper-vigilant,

06:31.260 --> 06:34.313
and her husband, Marshall, is...

06:34.364 --> 06:35.597
vivacious.

06:35.615 --> 06:39.318
This, that's happening here,
is not allowed!

06:39.369 --> 06:42.738
We at the society
for family stability foundation

06:42.772 --> 06:45.407
object to this smut being taught.

06:45.441 --> 06:47.159
It's against Pawnee's

06:47.210 --> 06:49.745
abstinence-only
sex education law.

06:49.779 --> 06:51.113
That's only for schools.

06:51.131 --> 06:53.165
Actually, it's not.
The way the bill is drafted

06:53.216 --> 06:54.883
prohibits any government employee

06:54.918 --> 06:58.087
from teaching anything
but abstinence, city-wide.

06:58.121 --> 06:59.722
- Thank you, Chris.
- You're welcome.

06:59.756 --> 07:02.032
If we allow this filth
to be taught to our seniors,

07:02.033 --> 07:04.393
the next you thing you know,
it'll be in our high schools,

07:04.394 --> 07:06.314
then our kindergartens,
and before you know it,

07:06.315 --> 07:07.796
we have babies in thong underwear.

07:07.814 --> 07:08.797
Is that what you want?

07:08.815 --> 07:10.232
Yes, that's what I want.

07:10.266 --> 07:12.901
Ladies and gentlemen,
this vulgar sex show is over.

07:12.936 --> 07:15.354
Please forget everything this
horrible woman has told you.

07:15.405 --> 07:19.808
It is not over.
It is far from over.

07:19.826 --> 07:22.828
Andy, pack up our bananas!

07:29.092 --> 07:30.114
This is a great idea.

07:30.234 --> 07:32.127
Fresh air, no screens.

07:32.178 --> 07:34.270
I'm getting really good
at chopping wood too.

07:34.941 --> 07:36.147
You're a regular Paul Bunyan.

07:36.267 --> 07:38.550
Ow!
I got stung by the wood!

07:38.584 --> 07:39.610
Oh, no, it's a splinter.

07:39.659 --> 07:40.826
I need to get on webMD now!

07:40.844 --> 07:42.661
I need a iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy,

07:42.679 --> 07:43.762
something with 4G.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.277
There's no time for the edge network.

07:45.278 --> 07:46.966
What are you doing?
Wha...? W-w-waa!

07:47.000 --> 07:49.185
Got it.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.853
I still think we should find a computer

07:50.887 --> 07:52.838
and Google
"sterilization techniques."

07:52.856 --> 07:54.240
Yeah, I have a new idea.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.926
You need to purge all of this
garbage from your system.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.211
Talk about all the things
you do on those screens,

07:59.246 --> 08:01.981
and let the words just
float away into the fresh air,

08:02.015 --> 08:04.617
- and then we will be done.
- Okay, worth a shot.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.403
Every day I start by hitting up
Facebook, Twitter,

08:07.454 --> 08:08.737
tumblr, and Instagram.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.739
Sometimes I like to throw in Linkedln,

08:10.790 --> 08:12.958
for the professional shorties.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.660
See?
That was easy.

08:14.694 --> 08:16.161
Then I like to go on reddit.

08:16.195 --> 08:17.379
Reddit's great, 'cause it has

08:17.414 --> 08:19.415
all the important links you need.

08:21.218 --> 08:22.635
- New shirt?
- Yeah.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.004
I got it at the dude ranch
with my boyfriend.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.389
- You like it?
- It's not my favorite shirt,

08:27.424 --> 08:30.926
but it is my least favorite shirt.

08:30.977 --> 08:32.510
Perd, we strongly believe

08:32.544 --> 08:36.048
in teaching and practicing abstinence.

08:36.066 --> 08:39.183
We all have some crazy urges
from time to time,

08:39.217 --> 08:40.552
but you just can't act on them.

08:40.570 --> 08:43.522
You have to bury them
way down deep inside.

08:43.556 --> 08:46.275
You have to say, "Get out
of here, you crazy urges!

08:46.326 --> 08:48.086
You are not welcome
in this brain of mine!"

08:48.087 --> 08:49.695
There are some statistics

08:49.729 --> 08:51.247
that I'd like to share with you now,

08:51.281 --> 08:52.915
and they are numbers.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.000
Some 85% of Pawnee residents

08:55.035 --> 08:57.736
support
abstinence-only education.

08:57.754 --> 09:00.089
And the other 15% are perverts.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.740
- J.K., you guys.
- [Laughs]

09:01.758 --> 09:04.627
And 100% of Pawneeans
are "perd-verts."

09:04.678 --> 09:06.118
- [Laughs]
- That's the name I call

09:06.119 --> 09:07.046
fans of this show

09:07.080 --> 09:09.848
based on the fact that my name is Perd.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.603
We'll see you
after the break, perd-verts.

09:11.635 --> 09:12.589
[Laughs]

09:12.590 --> 09:14.470
Look, we need an emergency
task force meeting.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.554
What do we do?

09:15.588 --> 09:16.972
Objective studies have shown

09:17.023 --> 09:19.275
that abstinence-only
education doesn't work.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.592
People still have sex.

09:20.610 --> 09:22.130
They don't know how to use protection,

09:22.131 --> 09:23.696
so the disease keeps spreading.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.564
We need to give people
practical knowledge.

09:25.598 --> 09:27.816
Ann Perkins, your expertise is thrilling,

09:27.867 --> 09:30.653
and frankly, almost arousing,

09:30.704 --> 09:32.037
but the law is the law.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.605
Well, you're on city council now.

09:33.623 --> 09:35.908
- Change the law.
- The people support this.

09:35.942 --> 09:38.276
I couldn't fight those numbers
even if I wanted to.

09:38.295 --> 09:39.710
It's political suicide.

09:39.711 --> 09:41.911
So we're just gonna do
the thing we know doesn't work?

09:41.912 --> 09:43.752
- Great plan.
- There's no other option, Ann.

09:43.753 --> 09:44.633
Put away your sex toys

09:44.634 --> 09:46.074
and play with them on your own time.

09:46.075 --> 09:48.120
- [Sighs]
- I did eat all the bananas,

09:48.138 --> 09:50.756
so you can't play with those.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.525
Oh, hey, nice work on the jobs research.

09:53.526 --> 09:56.095
Shh! Look.

09:57.314 --> 09:59.194
What am I looking at?
He's not doing anything.

09:59.195 --> 09:59.982
That's the point.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.234
This morning he got in, sat down in there,

10:02.268 --> 10:05.437
and has been staring
straight ahead, doing nothing.

10:05.471 --> 10:07.189
- He's a robot.
- He's not a robot.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.658
He's just thinking.
He's got a lot on his mind.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.977
Yeah, like, "One, one, zero, one.

10:11.995 --> 10:13.529
Must eat babies for fuel."

10:13.580 --> 10:14.997
[Scoffs] Why would a robot

10:15.031 --> 10:16.915
need to consume organic matter?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.367
Sorry.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.819
You know what,
they probably put a TV in there,

10:20.837 --> 10:24.289
and he's watching old speeches
to bone up or something.

10:24.323 --> 10:26.258
Let's go see.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.710
Congressman,

10:27.761 --> 10:30.629
here is the briefing packet
for our strategy meeting later.

10:30.663 --> 10:33.665
Excellent, thank you.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.135
Anything else I can do for you?

10:36.169 --> 10:38.837
No, sir.
All systems are operational.

10:38.855 --> 10:41.607
Great. Stay cool.
Hot one out there today.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.978
Thank you, congressman.

10:48.732 --> 10:52.117
Wikipedia:
Mankind's greatest invention/

10:52.152 --> 10:53.402
you can learn about anything.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.404
Take Ray J, for example.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.455
We all know he's a singer,
he's Brandy's brother,

10:57.456 --> 10:58.856
and he was in that classic sex tape

10:58.858 --> 11:00.242
with Kim Kardashian,

11:00.293 --> 11:03.078
but did you also know
he's Snoop Dogg's cousin

11:03.129 --> 11:06.248
and he was in the '96
Tim Burton movie <i>Mars Attacks?</i>

11:06.299 --> 11:08.333
Suddenly, you're on the <i>Mars Attacks</i> page.

11:08.367 --> 11:11.086
I love GChat.
You can talk to anybody.

11:11.137 --> 11:13.872
I hit up Brad. Pitt.
It wasn't the actor.

11:13.890 --> 11:17.476
It's actually a guy named Brad
that's a teacher in Pittsburgh.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.573
[Gunshots]

11:19.574 --> 11:21.814
We don't have a lot in common,
but we chat quite a bit.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.316
"Emoji" are little cartoons
you text instead of words.

11:24.335 --> 11:25.735
Instead of saying,
"What up, boo?"

11:25.736 --> 11:27.936
You can type "What up,"
and then a cute, little ghost,

11:27.937 --> 11:28.937
'cause
that means "boo."

11:28.988 --> 11:30.308
There's even a little Indian guy,

11:30.309 --> 11:32.274
but he has a turban on,
which I think is racist,

11:32.325 --> 11:34.693
but the Asian guy
also has a racist hat on,

11:34.727 --> 11:35.687
and it's like, "Hold up,

11:35.688 --> 11:37.168
didn't Japanese people
invent this?"

11:37.169 --> 11:39.031
Podcasts.
There are a million of 'em,

11:39.065 --> 11:40.732
and they're all amazing.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.636
Jean-Ralphio and I have one
called "Nacho average podcast,"

11:43.637 --> 11:45.237
where we rate different kinds of nachos.

11:45.255 --> 11:47.172
- It seems like...
- Okay, that's enough!

11:47.207 --> 11:48.406
No more talking.

11:48.425 --> 11:50.345
But you told me
to get it all out of my system.

11:50.346 --> 11:52.544
I had no idea how much
you had in your system.

11:52.578 --> 11:53.762
This is a real problem, tom.

11:53.797 --> 11:57.299
You are an addict and you need to change.

11:57.350 --> 12:01.270
I've downloaded
every episode of <i>Intervention.</i>

12:01.304 --> 12:04.189
I know what to do here.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.441
[Sober] You're right.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.809
I am an addict.

12:06.860 --> 12:10.195
I've hurt all my friends
and family with my addiction.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.597
I will accept this gift of rehabilitation.

12:12.615 --> 12:13.866
I'm proud of you,

12:13.900 --> 12:16.285
but also a bit fearful
that we're verging on

12:16.319 --> 12:19.037
what I call "feelings territory,"

12:19.072 --> 12:21.240
so let's stare at the fire in silence.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.275
I've had a breakthrough, Ron.

12:23.293 --> 12:25.110
What do you say
you chop up some more wood,

12:25.128 --> 12:26.378
and I'll take your car

12:26.412 --> 12:29.882
and go grab us some victory steaks?

12:30.967 --> 12:32.251
Perfect.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.503
I'm so glad you've come to your senses.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.421
Here's our educational pamphlet.

12:36.455 --> 12:38.557
I recommend you start reading
at chapter three.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.925
"Chapter three.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.119
There's a party in your pants
and no one is invited."

12:42.120 --> 12:43.762
This is crazy.
I mean, obviously,

12:43.796 --> 12:46.648
the best way to prevent disease
is to magically stop all sex,

12:46.683 --> 12:48.100
but that's not gonna happen.

12:48.134 --> 12:50.802
Well, maybe not where you
come from in "Tramp-sylvania."

12:50.820 --> 12:53.238
[Laughs] Good one, honey!

12:53.273 --> 12:56.024
I'm from Michigan!

12:56.075 --> 12:57.693
That wasn't worth saying.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.735
Why are you doing this?
You're gonna get up there

12:59.736 --> 13:01.496
and say a bunch of stuff
you don't believe?

13:01.497 --> 13:02.257
Well, it's the law.

13:02.258 --> 13:03.665
I get that.
I just...

13:03.700 --> 13:05.284
You're not acting like yourself.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.120
Really?
You want to go there?

13:08.154 --> 13:09.154
Go where?

13:09.172 --> 13:10.252
You know where we're going.

13:10.253 --> 13:11.540
No, I have no idea, honestly.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.871
Okay, I guess we're going there.

13:12.872 --> 13:13.825
Are we leaving?

13:13.843 --> 13:15.083
You want me to act like myself?

13:15.117 --> 13:16.277
You're dressed like a cowboy!

13:16.278 --> 13:18.797
So? It's fun,
and I like it.

13:18.831 --> 13:21.183
When you dated Andy,
you dressed in flannels.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.352
When you dated Chris,
you dressed in spandex.

13:23.386 --> 13:26.138
Ann, please do not lecture me
about acting like myself.

13:26.172 --> 13:29.525
You're dressed like an abstinence girl

13:29.559 --> 13:31.226
on the outside!

13:31.277 --> 13:32.877
God, I'm off my comeback game right now.

13:32.911 --> 13:34.951
You know what? I don't care,
do whatever you want.

13:34.952 --> 13:36.281
Okay.

Girl, you look like Annie Oakley

13:37.817 --> 13:41.203

had a baby and I love it.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.599
A deer jumped in front of the car,

13:44.600 --> 13:46.400

jumped in front of the deer!

Hello, my aged friends.

Some of you might remember
that I was here before.

- I don't remember that.
- Well, I was.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.832
But I have a new message for you.

14:26.866 --> 14:31.703
The best way to be safe
is to simply postpone sex

14:31.737 --> 14:33.288
until marriage.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.374
I am not going to be told not to have sex

16:43.976 --> 16:46.445
we will thrive!

16:46.479 --> 16:48.330
That's great.
Good.

16:48.364 --> 16:50.866
Cool beans.

16:50.917 --> 16:53.919
See you guys later.

16:55.254 --> 16:58.623
God, I love him.
He's the best.

16:58.657 --> 17:01.326
I'm sorry I crashed your car.

17:01.344 --> 17:03.462
Please forgive me, Ron.
Please, Ron?

17:03.496 --> 17:05.847
Please?

17:05.882 --> 17:07.722
What are you doing?
Are you going to kill me?

17:07.723 --> 17:11.185
Why do you need to be
constantly distracted, tom?

17:13.306 --> 17:14.522
The truth is

17:14.557 --> 17:16.474
I spend a lot of time looking at screens

17:16.509 --> 17:17.943
because recently,

17:17.977 --> 17:19.394
a lot of the stuff in my real life

17:19.444 --> 17:20.862
isn't going that great.

17:20.896 --> 17:23.949
So I'd rather play Doodle Jump
then think about that.

17:23.983 --> 17:26.952
Okay?
I'm sorry, I really am.

17:28.186 --> 17:29.538
Go sit in your office

17:29.572 --> 17:32.791
while I consider whether
to turn you in to the judge.

17:32.825 --> 17:35.961
And while you're there,
neither doodle nor jump.

17:40.633 --> 17:44.369
Hey. I just wanted
to come lend my support.

17:44.387 --> 17:45.827
What are you going to say out there?

17:45.828 --> 17:48.006
I don't know.
I got censured, it's a big deal.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.926
Well, if you ask me,
you were elected to lead

17:50.977 --> 17:52.344
and not to follow.

17:52.378 --> 17:54.646
Which is probably what I should've said

17:54.680 --> 17:56.014
instead of what I did say.

17:56.048 --> 17:57.682
I feel terrible about what I said too.

17:57.716 --> 17:59.217
No, you were right.

17:59.235 --> 18:01.386
I know, but I still feel terrible.

18:01.404 --> 18:02.737
I'm sorry, continue.

18:02.772 --> 18:05.023
I kind of lost myself
in this relationship.

18:05.057 --> 18:07.225
I bought a lasso online, Leslie.

18:07.243 --> 18:08.326
Yikes.

18:08.361 --> 18:10.695
I turned all my jeans into Daisy Dukes.

18:10.729 --> 18:12.831
My personality kinda gets swept up

18:12.865 --> 18:16.067
in whatever guy I'm dating,
and I want to change that.

18:16.085 --> 18:17.569
I broke it off with Ricky.

18:17.587 --> 18:19.067
Well, that's good, but I'll tell you,

18:19.071 --> 18:21.540
he'll never lasso another heifer

18:21.574 --> 18:25.126
as fine as you, Annie Oakley.

18:25.178 --> 18:27.412
The story of that commercial break is

18:27.446 --> 18:28.547
it's over.

18:28.581 --> 18:31.183
Leslie, what exactly does "censure" mean?

18:31.217 --> 18:33.101
It means that I have been
formally disciplined

18:33.135 --> 18:34.636
for breaking the law.

18:34.687 --> 18:37.922
Well, you know what they say,
"You break it, you buy it."

18:37.940 --> 18:39.407
That doesn't really apply here.

18:39.442 --> 18:41.443
Tell that to the folks at Pier 1,

18:41.477 --> 18:44.762
an establishment
I'm no longer allowed inside.

18:44.780 --> 18:46.264
Perd, I'd like to apologize.

18:46.282 --> 18:47.566
Thank you.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.435
Apologize for the antiquated
laws in this city.

18:50.453 --> 18:53.154
States that teach
abstinence-only

18:53.206 --> 18:55.740
have the highest rates
of teen pregnancy and STDs.

18:55.774 --> 18:57.659
To continue this policy is insane.

18:57.710 --> 19:01.112
Look, we all want the same thing, right?

19:01.130 --> 19:04.249
We want fewer unwanted
pregnancies and fewer STDs.

19:04.283 --> 19:06.618
Why don't we use
every weapon that we have?

19:06.636 --> 19:08.953
I know that most of you
don't agree with me on this,

19:08.971 --> 19:12.140
but I'm going to fight very hard
to change your minds,

19:12.174 --> 19:14.759
and until then, I will take this censure,

19:14.793 --> 19:18.796
and I will wear it proudly,
like a badge of honor.

19:18.814 --> 19:20.315
Wow, strong words from a woman

19:20.349 --> 19:23.018
who is trying to pin
a piece of paper to her blazer.

19:23.069 --> 19:26.471
Next up on the program,
we hear from you, our fans,

19:26.489 --> 19:29.574
in our new segment,
"Are you there, perd-verts?

19:29.609 --> 19:32.777
It's me, Perd,
hosting a new segment."

19:32.811 --> 19:36.314
[Groans] I'm so bored.

19:36.332 --> 19:37.582
I have something for you, son.

19:37.617 --> 19:39.534
- My iPhone?
- No.

19:39.585 --> 19:41.486
I am giving you
a non-electronic book

19:41.504 --> 19:42.704
made of paper from a tree.

19:42.755 --> 19:47.158
It is called
<i>Auto Repair Manual: 1982.</i>

19:47.176 --> 19:49.160
You will read this book
from cover to cover,

19:49.178 --> 19:52.430
then you will assist me in
repairing the damage to my car.

19:52.465 --> 19:54.432
I will not report you to the judge,

19:54.467 --> 19:57.001
but if you slip up again,
you will have much more to fear

19:57.019 --> 19:59.521
than some feeble
government employee in a robe.

19:59.555 --> 20:01.005
- Thanks.
- Two more things.

20:01.023 --> 20:02.307
When you do get your phone back,

20:02.341 --> 20:03.769
you will not stare at it

20:03.770 --> 20:05.610
when you're talking
with another human being.

20:05.645 --> 20:07.812
Look a man in the eye
when you speak with him.

20:07.846 --> 20:09.781
And second, if you ever need

20:09.815 --> 20:13.401
to discuss your problems with someone...

20:13.452 --> 20:16.020
find Leslie.
She lives for that crap.

20:16.038 --> 20:19.190
Get to work.

20:19.208 --> 20:21.660
They're killing me in the press.

20:21.694 --> 20:24.462
The <i>Pawnee Sun</i>
is calling me "Loose-ly Grope."

20:24.497 --> 20:26.030
But you know what?
I don't even care.

20:26.048 --> 20:27.288
I'm gonna kick all their asses!

20:27.289 --> 20:28.550
I am so fired up!

20:28.584 --> 20:30.835
I'm gonna go right now
and drink, like, 1,000 Red Bulls

20:30.869 --> 20:33.505
so I can draft a new bill
to undo abstinence-only.

20:33.539 --> 20:35.757
Man, you are just a machine.

20:35.808 --> 20:36.969
Get stuff done.

20:36.970 --> 20:39.210
Hey, why don't you send it to me
when you have a draft?

20:39.211 --> 20:40.931
- I'll try to help.
- You're the greatest.

20:40.965 --> 20:43.045
But you're gonna have
to take out a lot of cursing,

20:43.046 --> 20:44.606
'cause like I said, I am very fired up.

20:44.607 --> 20:46.868
Well, you go get 'em.
I love you.

20:46.902 --> 20:49.154
I love you too.
What are you wearing?

20:49.188 --> 20:50.855
I can't do that right now.

20:50.889 --> 20:51.873
[Laughs]

20:51.993 --> 20:58.889

20:59.604 --> 21:03.092
- Yo, you ready to go?
- Why, yes, I am, April!

21:03.335 --> 21:05.001
Let's go now!

21:05.003 --> 21:06.002
What's wrong with you?

21:06.004 --> 21:08.013
[Fake laugh] Wonderful!

21:08.133 --> 21:09.588
Hey, be careful out there.

21:09.708 --> 21:11.975
Traffic is nuts on the streets and roads.

21:11.977 --> 21:14.511
Oh, no!
They got you!

21:14.513 --> 21:16.096
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ah, ha, ha.

21:16.098 --> 21:17.751
Terrific!
Hey, I'm hungry.

21:17.847 --> 21:20.430
Let's go eat some batteries...
I mean, human food.

21:20.432 --> 21:21.715
Hey, uh, batteries...

21:21.717 --> 21:23.684
I mean, human food sounds good to me.

21:23.686 --> 21:24.781
Wonderful.

21:27.172 --> 21:29.356
- Let's go.
- [Laughs]
