"Better Of Ted"

00:06.764 --> 00:09.941
Inpr ncihel fr alng lst thing
lYibelm ingles

00:10.033 --> 00:12.285
In a recent study,
people's desire to see things

00:12.320 --> 00:14.646
Ranked third, right after
hitting things

00:14.647 --> 00:16.280
And trying to have sex with things.

00:16.280 --> 00:19.272
- And if people could...
- Hey, That's my doughnut!

00:19.273 --> 00:21.799
Shut up. Ted's talking.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.639
By leveling the current, we have
increased bulb life by 38%.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.719
This is the greatest leap
in bulb technology since...

00:28.286 --> 00:30.577
-Interesting fact...
the original lightbulb shape

00:30.578 --> 00:32.512
Was patterned
off edison's neighbor,

00:32.514 --> 00:34.714
Whose head was
hideously enormous.

00:34.715 --> 00:37.583
This bulb lasts so long,
it will be giving off light

00:37.584 --> 00:41.413
Well after you're dead.

00:41.414 --> 00:45.183
Gentlemen, when you fight
like that, manhood weeps.

00:45.184 --> 00:48.452
Nice work, ted. You've made
a super long-lasting lightbulb.

00:48.453 --> 00:50.755
And since that's the name
of this project,

00:50.756 --> 00:52.722
Your instincts are spot-on.

00:52.723 --> 00:54.624
Thank you, everybody.

00:54.625 --> 00:58.794
The company's gonna love this.
And I can't get enough
of the company's love.

00:58.795 --> 01:01.195
Maybe you and the company
should spend a weekend

01:01.196 --> 01:04.165
In wine country together, share
a couple of bottles one evening,

01:04.166 --> 01:07.401
Maybe convince it
not to wear panties to dinner.

01:07.402 --> 01:09.335
You should jump on that,
ted,

01:09.336 --> 01:11.404
Before the crazy
outweighs the hot.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.273
So there's a famous theoretical
physicist named stella clifton

01:14.274 --> 01:16.174
Giving a lecture tonight.

01:16.175 --> 01:18.443
She's on the company's radar,
and I'd like for you

01:18.444 --> 01:20.745
To go talk to her
about coming to work here.

01:20.746 --> 01:22.847
I'd emphasize
the salary she'd make

01:22.848 --> 01:25.315
And downplay the way
we treat people.

01:25.316 --> 01:27.550
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help but overhear.

01:27.551 --> 01:29.619
Hiring stella clifton
would be a huge mistake.

01:29.620 --> 01:32.588
She's arrogant, super critical

01:32.589 --> 01:34.389
And hangs her wet bras
on everything.

01:34.390 --> 01:37.392
I mean, that's the buzz
in the physics chat rooms.

01:40.063 --> 01:43.598
Stella clifton is lem's mom.
He doesn't want people to know

01:43.599 --> 01:46.767
Because he's always felt
overshadowed by her.
So you're saying
we have an in?

01:46.768 --> 01:49.170
I'm saying, can't we
just let this one go?

01:49.171 --> 01:50.604
Wouldn't be the first time

01:50.605 --> 01:52.606
We didn't hire
a brilliant scientist

01:52.607 --> 01:55.208
Because someone at the company
would be upset.

01:55.209 --> 01:57.576
Remember bob hitler?
No, I forgot
the scientist named hitler.

01:57.577 --> 01:59.644
Okay, fine.
We won't go after lem's mom.

01:59.645 --> 02:01.546
But this would be easier
to sell upstairs

02:01.547 --> 02:04.648
If someone named clifton had
bombed the hell out of london.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.252
Good morning, phil.

02:10.253 --> 02:11.655
You're late.

02:11.656 --> 02:14.057
Were you up watching
that documentary on moss?

02:14.058 --> 02:16.593
Can you believe how much
that stuff likes shade?

02:16.594 --> 02:20.730
It just goes nuts.
No, I was up because my mom
was having sex with some guy.

02:20.731 --> 02:23.533
Ohh.
Either that, or they were
using her bed to hammer

02:23.534 --> 02:25.835
A very stubborn nail
into the wall.

02:25.836 --> 02:27.801
It's not right
the way she treats you.

02:27.802 --> 02:31.271
She's so inconsiderate.
She's like rhodesian wet moss.

02:31.272 --> 02:34.540
That stuff doesn't give a damn
who it hurts.

02:34.541 --> 02:37.276
good morning!
I had sex last night.

02:37.277 --> 02:39.844
that's right--
dirty, sloppy sex.

02:39.845 --> 02:41.946
Truly, gentlemen,
my hips were a blur.

02:41.947 --> 02:43.914
I went to
the stella clifton lecture,

02:43.915 --> 02:46.984
And afrwards we started
to chat and hit it off.

02:46.985 --> 02:50.186
So we went to a bar--
tell me you met another woman
there and went home with her.

02:50.187 --> 02:52.755
I did meet another woman.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.523
But she wasn't interested,
so I went home

02:54.524 --> 02:56.558
With stella clifton
and porked her all night.

02:56.559 --> 02:59.660
Oh, god! Oh, god!
oh, god!
Yeah, she sounded
just like that.

03:00.996 --> 03:05.066
I had a great idea.
You should have come in here

03:05.067 --> 03:07.401
Holding that bulb over your head
so I could tell.

03:07.402 --> 03:10.671
Yesterday I was in my cubicle,
and a fly got caught in my lamp,

03:10.672 --> 03:12.873
And it started to cook.
That's not really an idea.

03:12.874 --> 03:14.942
That's more of
an unpleasant anecdote

03:14.943 --> 03:17.878
Or a cautionary tale for flies.
No, the bulb kept giving off
this putrid smell,

03:17.879 --> 03:19.880
So I sprayed perfume on it.

03:19.881 --> 03:21.816
And then today
when I turned my lamp on,

03:21.817 --> 03:24.252
My whole cubicle smelled pretty.
And so I thought,

03:24.253 --> 03:28.155
Bing! We should develop a line
of scented lightbulbs.

03:28.156 --> 03:29.924
Uh...

03:29.925 --> 03:32.694
And react positively.

03:32.695 --> 03:34.362
Okay, um...

03:34.363 --> 03:36.364
You hate it.

03:36.365 --> 03:38.199
All I ever do
is test other people's ideas.

03:38.200 --> 03:41.302
I was so excited to finally
come up with one of my own.

03:41.303 --> 03:43.671
But you're right.
It's stupid.

03:43.672 --> 03:45.639
I should die
like a lightbulb fly.

03:45.640 --> 03:48.608
No, it's not stupid. It's just,
I have spent years developing

03:48.609 --> 03:50.575
This long-lasting bulb,
and I don't want

03:50.576 --> 03:53.507
To distract the company
with a different one.

03:53.508 --> 03:55.905
Not to oversell it,
but mine will save the world,

03:55.906 --> 03:57.940
And then veridian
will change its name

03:57.941 --> 04:00.008
To ted's awesome
lightbulb company.

04:03.512 --> 04:05.746
Perfect.
Now I can tell my joke.

04:05.747 --> 04:08.749
How many product testers does
it take to change a lightbulb?

04:08.750 --> 04:10.684
Ted hated my idea.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.885
No. Seven.

04:12.886 --> 04:16.221
The end still needs work.
I told ted an idea I had
for a scented lightbulb,

04:16.223 --> 04:18.523
But he didn't think
we should do it.

04:18.524 --> 04:21.259
Hmm. I think a scented lightbulb
is a good idea.

04:21.260 --> 04:23.460
Really? You think
it's worth pursuing?

04:23.461 --> 04:26.363
No, I don't.
Oh.

04:26.364 --> 04:28.464
I'm kidding. I like it.
You do?

04:28.465 --> 04:30.666
No.
Oh.

04:30.667 --> 04:33.002
Seriously, I like it.
Okay, what are we doing now?

04:33.003 --> 04:35.370
I'm showing you that you care
too much what people think.

04:35.371 --> 04:37.739
Successful people
don't do that, linda.

04:37.740 --> 04:39.775
You've gotta be confident.
You've got a good idea,

04:39.776 --> 04:42.977
- And you shouldn't let anyone stop you.
- You really think it's a good idea?

04:42.978 --> 04:45.079
No, I don't.
Well, I do.

04:45.080 --> 04:48.215
Finally! And that's why
it takes seven product testers

04:48.216 --> 04:50.183
To change a lightbulb.

04:52.653 --> 04:56.122
So I took linda's idea
for scented lightbulbs

04:56.123 --> 04:58.857
Upstairs to chet,
and he loved it.

04:58.858 --> 05:00.158
Really?

05:00.159 --> 05:01.693
Wow.

05:01.694 --> 05:03.695
You went over my head
on this?

05:03.696 --> 05:05.830
No. I-I just went out your door
and ran into veronica.

05:05.831 --> 05:08.932
Then she went over your head.
The company sees this
as a whole new way

05:08.933 --> 05:11.000
To market lightbulbs
to women.

05:11.001 --> 05:13.202
And since you thought of
the idea and you're a woman,

05:13.203 --> 05:16.205
Even though your shoes
argue otherwise,

05:16.206 --> 05:20.175
The company wants you to co-run
the project with ted.
That's fantastic.

05:20.176 --> 05:22.977
D, are you okay with this?
Please be okay with this.

05:22.978 --> 05:25.446
It would be so exciting
if we could work together

05:25.447 --> 05:27.915
On a project that I
came up with.

05:27.916 --> 05:29.483
Of course.

05:29.484 --> 05:32.318
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

05:32.319 --> 05:35.421
- It is going to be...
- And your lightbulb project is dead.

05:35.682 --> 05:37.389
Fantastic.

05:45.394 --> 05:47.329
- Mommy?
- Hello, sweetheart.

05:46.318 --> 05:49.155
How was your day at the crap factory?

05:49.156 --> 05:52.041
You know, sometimes I feel
like you judge what I do.

05:52.042 --> 05:53.172
I'm not judging you.

05:53.207 --> 05:53.931
I just weighed
the empirical evidence

05:53.932 --> 05:56.066
And came to
an objective conclusion--

05:56.067 --> 05:57.867
You're wasting your talent.

05:57.868 --> 06:01.337
It's like jackson pollock
painting cars for $99.95.

06:01.338 --> 06:03.672
Listen...

06:03.673 --> 06:06.208
I wanted to talk
to you about dr. Bhamba.

06:06.209 --> 06:08.309
My new lover?
yes.

06:08.310 --> 06:09.877
It's just, you two dating

06:09.878 --> 06:11.812
Is making it awkward
for me at work.

06:11.813 --> 06:13.680
Heaven forbid
I've slowed production

06:13.681 --> 06:15.648
Of the latest
worthless gadget.

06:15.649 --> 06:18.017
What will people do
without a helmet

06:18.018 --> 06:20.052
That feeds them cheeseburgers

06:20.053 --> 06:23.488
Or a remote control
for their underpants?
We're not making
a cheeseburger helmet.

06:23.489 --> 06:24.989
They pulled the plug

06:24.990 --> 06:27.858
After it fed one of
the test subjects to death.

06:27.859 --> 06:30.226
I'm sorry, lem, but I'm
not giving up my bhamba.

06:30.227 --> 06:31.794
He's a very special man.

06:31.795 --> 06:34.597
Look. This robe is so short,
if I were a bell,

06:34.598 --> 06:36.498
You could almost see
my clapper.

06:38.134 --> 06:40.468
I'm never calling you daddy.
Never, never!

06:43.172 --> 06:44.906
Okay...

06:44.907 --> 06:46.841
I am happy for linda.

06:46.842 --> 06:48.442
Yay, linda.

06:48.443 --> 06:50.577
But the long-lasting bulb
is important to me.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.512
And taking my feelings
completely out of it,

06:52.513 --> 06:54.747
It is way better than
linda's dumb, smelly bulb.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.849
Ted, ted, ted.
I see what's going on here.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.384
You're worried that after years
of the company adoring you,

07:00.385 --> 07:02.419
A shiny, new linda
has come along,

07:02.420 --> 07:06.422
And they may not have enough
love for both of you.
I am not
worried about that.

07:06.423 --> 07:09.392
Did they say
that's what's happening?
I know what
you're going through.

07:09.393 --> 07:12.027
When my little sister
came along, I was very jealous.

07:12.028 --> 07:14.829
That feeling never went away--
even when she was older,

07:14.830 --> 07:16.697
And I put testosterone
in her orange juice

07:16.698 --> 07:18.699
So she became hairy
and unlovable

07:18.700 --> 07:22.335
And got kicked off
the gymnastics team for doping.
Oh, my god!

07:22.336 --> 07:24.337
I was not
a perfect child, ted.

07:24.338 --> 07:26.272
My parents only had
so much love,

07:26.273 --> 07:28.507
And I got it,
and monkey girl didn't.

07:28.508 --> 07:31.810
Anyway, don't be like that.

07:34.613 --> 07:36.647
whoo!

07:36.648 --> 07:38.048
Ow!

07:39.484 --> 07:41.952
Maybe bhamba's
not talking about your mom.

07:41.953 --> 07:44.054
Maybe he's talking
about the time

07:44.055 --> 07:47.723
He won that hula-hoop
competition.
And that's how I won
the hula-hoop competition...

07:49.425 --> 07:52.327
And developed the pelvic stamina
to satisfy the sexual desires

07:52.328 --> 07:54.729
Of the famous
dr. Stella clifton.

07:54.730 --> 07:57.665
I can't believe your mom
is doing this to you.

07:57.666 --> 07:59.635
She's really not
going to stop seeing bhamba?

07:59.636 --> 08:02.138
Nope. I spent my whole life
trying not to be

08:02.139 --> 08:04.139
Just the son of the famous
stella clifton,

08:04.140 --> 08:06.842
And now that's all anyone's
going to be talking about.

08:06.843 --> 08:09.377
He it's stella clifton's son!
Welcome to veridian.

08:09.378 --> 08:11.778
We expect great things
from you.

08:11.779 --> 08:14.113
I've been working here
for 11 years.

08:14.114 --> 08:16.115
oh, I doubt that.

08:16.116 --> 08:18.050
Great to have you aboard.

08:21.754 --> 08:23.887
okay, everybody's here.

08:23.888 --> 08:26.556
Okay! Everybody's here.

08:26.557 --> 08:29.325
I know you're co-leading this,
but that doesn't mean

08:29.326 --> 08:31.760
Just repeating what I say.
Maybe you're repeating
what I say

08:31.761 --> 08:33.760
Just before I get
a chance to say it.

08:33.761 --> 08:35.863
Okay, linda. Why don't you
take the meeting?

08:35.864 --> 08:38.065
All right, I will.
Ted, bring us up to speed.

08:38.066 --> 08:41.400
All right. First of all,
let's talk about a timeline.
Timeline, people.

08:41.402 --> 08:43.903
Because some of us who have
never run a project before

08:43.904 --> 08:46.404
May not realize it can take
years to go from an idea

08:46.405 --> 08:48.806
To a workable prototype.
Am I right, fellas?

08:48.807 --> 08:50.174
Absolutely.

08:50.175 --> 08:51.541
See?

08:51.542 --> 08:53.944
But in this case, the concept
was so elegantly simple

08:53.945 --> 08:56.979
That we banged one out
this morning.

08:56.980 --> 08:58.415
Interesting.

08:58.416 --> 09:01.318
So then I would be
safe to say... Ha.

09:01.319 --> 09:03.419
please. Your bulb
smells like pumpkin pie.

09:03.420 --> 09:05.287
Mine would have
slowed climate change.

09:05.288 --> 09:07.989
But I guess
when the ice caps melt,

09:07.990 --> 09:10.224
We will need something that
smellsood to cover up

09:10.225 --> 09:13.695
The stench of all
the dead polar bears.
Boys, how long would it take
to develop new technology

09:13.696 --> 09:17.031
So that ted can
go screw himself?
Mm, we're not prepared
to address--

09:17.032 --> 09:20.868
don't talk.
This isn't about us.

09:20.869 --> 09:24.539
Look... I think
it's gonna be impossible

09:24.540 --> 09:26.207
For us to co-lead
these meetings.

09:26.208 --> 09:29.244
Can't take a little heat,
like your precious polar bears?

09:29.245 --> 09:33.113
Wait. How did I get on the crazy
side of climate change?
There she is.

09:33.114 --> 09:35.948
Linda, you remember
my boss chet?

09:35.949 --> 09:38.349
You better watch out
for this one, ted.

09:38.350 --> 09:41.418
She could be the new t,
a super sweet-smelng ted.

09:41.419 --> 09:43.487
Oh, that's just my bulbs,
sir.

09:43.488 --> 09:45.822
Hey-o!
Very funny, chet.

09:45.823 --> 09:48.825
You tiptoed right up to the line
but didn't cross it.

09:48.826 --> 09:52.162
Yeah. Oh, she's a sharp one.
Wah your back, stud.

09:52.163 --> 09:54.964
Hey!  once again,
sir, right up to the line.

09:54.965 --> 09:57.699
This project
is going to be great.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.234
I hope so, sir.

09:59.235 --> 10:01.736
What do you mean,
you hope so?

10:01.737 --> 10:04.238
Nothing. I-I just hope
everything goes well.

10:04.239 --> 10:07.240
Why wouldn't it?
Is there a problem, veronica?

10:07.241 --> 10:08.908
Not at all. It's a home run.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.777
Linda was just doing a funny
chter she's been working on.
Oh.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.212
It's a product tester
whose lack of confidence

10:14.213 --> 10:17.182
Trs her in a sad cuble
where she dies old andne

10:17.183 --> 10:21.552
Without ever owning
a decent purse.
Well, as long as she
never does it again,

10:21.553 --> 10:23.286
I don't see the harm.

10:25.122 --> 10:27.390
There's a meeting
on your project

10:27.391 --> 10:29.292
Tomorrow night
with the department heads.

10:29.293 --> 10:32.294
If you want to be in the game,
you're gonna have to show

10:32.295 --> 10:34.429
A lot more confidence
than you just did.

10:34.430 --> 10:37.464
I love that one.
I hate that one,

10:37.465 --> 10:39.899
And bring me chicken
for lunch.
What were those?

10:39.900 --> 10:43.369
I have no idea, but did you
see how confident I was?

10:43.370 --> 10:45.237
So confident,
I'm getting chicken.

10:45.238 --> 10:48.239
Now you try it.

10:48.240 --> 10:51.575
What do I tell him to do?
It doesn't matter.
Just make sure he does it.

10:55.313 --> 10:57.281
Lose the tie, hippie.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.316
What?
What's wrong with my tie?

10:59.317 --> 11:01.684
Are you questioning me?
Oh, that's rich.

11:01.685 --> 11:03.820
I said lose it!

11:03.821 --> 11:05.922
And bring me a chicken.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.859
Very nicely done.

11:10.860 --> 11:12.894
Today, we feast on chicken,

11:12.895 --> 11:15.663
Although you may be
getting a live one.

11:20.502 --> 11:24.471
Why are you looking up
my mother's facebook page?

11:24.472 --> 11:26.873
I'm going to find her, seduce h,

11:26.874 --> 11:29.508
And make sensitive
yet vigorous love  h

11:29.509 --> 11:32.077
Well, that's the one thing
we haven't tried

11:32.078 --> 11:34.012
To get her out of the coma.

11:34.013 --> 11:36.247
Maybe I could save you
three very weird minutes.

11:36.248 --> 11:39.349
Things between your mother and I
have hit a rough patch.
Oh, no.

11:39.350 --> 11:42.219
What do I do with that world's
greatest stepdad coffee mug

11:42.220 --> 11:44.520
I got for you?

11:44.521 --> 11:45.686
Guess I have to take it back
to the sarcasm store.

11:45.687 --> 11:48.626
It's just,
stella is so intelligent,

11:48.661 --> 11:49.324
I'm starting to feel
like an idiot around her.

11:49.325 --> 11:51.927
I know what you mean.
She's always reminding me

11:51.928 --> 11:54.129
That while she's unlocking
the secrets of the universe,

11:54.130 --> 11:57.665
I'm trying to design a toaster
that can handle a pizza bagel.

11:57.666 --> 12:00.400
That would be a boon
to both jews and italians.

12:00.401 --> 12:02.335
You're a very good scientist,
lem.

12:02.336 --> 12:05.338
U shouldn't feel
inferior to your mother.
Well, neither should you.

12:05.339 --> 12:07.506
Your breakthroughs
in weapons technology

12:07.507 --> 12:10.008
Have made warfare
exponentially more horrifying.

12:10.009 --> 12:12.777
Well,
I don't know about that.

12:12.778 --> 12:16.113
It takes a village
to kill a village.

12:16.114 --> 12:18.115
I wonder, if only
there were a way

12:18.116 --> 12:20.550
To show your mother we're
intellectually worthy of her.

12:20.551 --> 12:22.051
Well, I'm out of ideas.

12:22.052 --> 12:25.020
I helped put a satellite
into orbit when I was 11,

12:25.021 --> 12:26.555
But it wasn't
"geosynchronous,"

12:26.556 --> 12:29.324
So she wouldn't even look up
when it went over our house.

12:29.325 --> 12:31.826
We're both smart.
Maybe if we work together,

12:31.827 --> 12:33.894
We could do something
to impress her--

12:33.895 --> 12:35.595
Like a bagel toaster
that tracks down enemies

12:35.596 --> 12:38.331
And burns them evenly
on both sides.

12:38.332 --> 12:41.333
No, not that.
Or something
she would appreciate--

12:41.334 --> 12:42.768
Something theoretical,

12:42.769 --> 12:45.437
With no practical application
whatever.
Yes!

12:45.438 --> 12:48.372
Just to be clear,
it has to be science, right?

12:48.373 --> 12:51.075
Not just a great dance move
or something?

12:54.245 --> 12:57.614
Come on. One great idea.

12:57.615 --> 13:00.416
Lightbulbs that... Taste good.

13:00.417 --> 13:02.685
No, that sucks! I suck.

13:02.686 --> 13:04.720
No wonder the company's
gone off me.

13:04.721 --> 13:06.788
So "suck" is okay
to say now?

13:06.789 --> 13:09.390
'cause I have some thoughts
about the lunch

13:09.391 --> 13:12.393
You packed me today.
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm just a little frustrated.

13:12.394 --> 13:14.695
I'm trying
to figure out something

13:14.696 --> 13:16.229
The company
would really appreciate.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.998
Well, why don't you just as?

13:18.999 --> 13:21.634
I always like it on my birthday
when you ask me what I want.

13:21.635 --> 13:24.736
Well, the company
doesn't know what it...

13:24.737 --> 13:27.772
Stella clifton. That's it.

13:27.773 --> 13:30.841
That's what they want.
I'll get them stella clifton.

13:30.842 --> 13:32.776
Mwah! Thank you, honey.

13:32.777 --> 13:34.277
If you think about it,

13:34.278 --> 13:36.812
It's not hard to figure out
what people want,

13:36.813 --> 13:39.615
Especial if they tell you
over and over again.

13:39.616 --> 13:42.417
We're not getting
motorcyc with a sidecar.

13:42.418 --> 13:45.486
- It's just not practical.
- We'll see.

13:51.458 --> 13:53.992
What's 4 plus 8?

13:53.993 --> 13:57.094
I don't know. A triangle?

13:57.095 --> 13:59.330
I'm very tired.

13:59.331 --> 14:01.365
What is all this?

14:01.366 --> 14:03.967
We've been up all night trying
to earn my mother's respect

14:03.968 --> 14:06.035
By solving
clifton's unfinished equation,

14:06.036 --> 14:09.004
Which, as the name implies,
she's been unable to finish.

14:09.005 --> 14:12.474
Lem, you shouldn't have to
prove anything to your mom.

14:12.475 --> 14:15.877
You're great,
and if she can't see that,

14:15.878 --> 14:18.413
Then she is an insensitive idiot

14:18.414 --> 14:21.081
Who happens to be hot and sexy.
Phil!

14:21.082 --> 14:23.416
I am still a man.

14:30.990 --> 14:34.025
Are you ready for the meeting?
We have to cancel.

14:34.026 --> 14:36.227
Ted's disappeared,
and I just found out,

14:36.228 --> 14:39.396
If you leave the scented bulbs
on for three days,

14:39.397 --> 14:42.864
It smells like rotting meat.
Linda, listen to yourself.
Those are just facts,

14:42.865 --> 14:45.733
And facts are just opinions,
and opinions can be wrong.

14:45.734 --> 14:48.435
The only thing that is
never wrong is confidence.

14:48.436 --> 14:51.071
But--
no buts.
I brought this upstairs,

14:51.072 --> 14:52.972
And your failure
will be my failure.

14:52.973 --> 14:55.641
You can do this.
I know you can.

14:55.642 --> 14:57.508
Now get in there
and run that meeting

14:57.509 --> 14:59.543
Like a shark
driving an assault vehicle

14:59.544 --> 15:02.246
Through a herd of seals
wearing chum pants.

15:02.247 --> 15:04.949
I'll do it.

15:04.950 --> 15:08.455
And so with aromas ranging from
zucchini bread to fresh laundry,

15:08.456 --> 15:11.090
The scented lightbulb
has zero downside.

15:11.091 --> 15:13.092
I heard that
after a couple of days,

15:13.093 --> 15:15.828
The bulb stinks
like rotting meat.

15:17.864 --> 15:19.331
Then you, sir,

15:19.332 --> 15:22.400
Are the stupidest man
who's ever lived.

15:22.401 --> 15:23.767
What?

15:23.768 --> 15:24.835
What?

15:24.836 --> 15:27.303
I'm an executive
who says, "what?"

15:27.304 --> 15:30.539
What are you, 2? You're the one
who smells like rotting meat.

15:30.540 --> 15:34.041
finish him.
Oh, my god.
You're jealous of the lightbulb.

15:34.042 --> 15:37.143
That's what this is about.
You hate light and smell.

15:37.144 --> 15:39.946
What in the name of god
did your paren do to you?

15:39.947 --> 15:42.781
Saunders, take your
weird, emotional issues

15:42.782 --> 15:44.716
And get out.

15:46.619 --> 15:48.686
sorry.

15:48.687 --> 15:50.187
no weakness.

15:50.188 --> 15:52.956
anyone else
hear any stupid rumors

15:52.957 --> 15:54.357
About my lightbulb?

15:54.358 --> 15:56.325
Come on, bring it.

15:58.961 --> 16:01.362
so I took
stella clifton to dinner

16:01.363 --> 16:03.430
To convince her
to come work veridian.

16:03.431 --> 16:05.965
And I brought phil along
in case the conversation

16:05.966 --> 16:08.333
Got all science-y on me.
If you join the vedian team,

16:08.334 --> 16:11.204
You would have access to
unmatched scientific resources,

16:11.205 --> 16:13.907
From hydro-perlation
nongravitational calibrators

16:13.908 --> 16:16.676
To executives who only know
the name of one cool thing

16:16.677 --> 16:18.677
But will stay out of your way.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.579
I've always felt that when
science is seduced by commerce,

16:21.580 --> 16:24.116
Scientists become
intellectual prostitutes--

16:24.117 --> 16:26.651
Mind sluts, brain whores.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.786
Well, we don't have
to pay you.

16:29.787 --> 16:32.355
Uh, so, phil,
you've been a little quiet.

16:32.356 --> 16:34.524
Why don't you tell
dr. Clifton what you like

16:34.525 --> 16:36.459
About working at veridian?

16:36.460 --> 16:37.960
ahh.

16:37.961 --> 16:40.862
You're a bitch.

16:40.863 --> 16:43.465
And there's a gym,
which has a little juice bar.

16:43.466 --> 16:45.567
Who needs to exercise at a gym

16:45.568 --> 16:48.136
When you've got your son's ego
to beat up on?

16:48.137 --> 16:51.205
Phillip myman,
if I am a little hard on lem,

16:51.206 --> 16:53.106
It's because I'm helping him
by pointing out

16:53.107 --> 16:55.909
Potential areas
for improvement.
When ted asked me
to come tonight,

16:55.910 --> 16:58.077
I agreed for one reason--

16:58.078 --> 17:01.413
To tell you that your son
is a great guy

17:01.414 --> 17:04.749
And a brilliant scientist,
and if you don't want him

17:04.750 --> 17:07.284
To go through life feeling
like crap about himself,

17:07.285 --> 17:10.286
You should tell him you're
proud of him once in a while.
Okay, this is my fault.

17:10.287 --> 17:13.988
I should not have let phil
have his own grown-up drink.
And you.

17:13.989 --> 17:16.955
You're so desperate to score
points with the company,

17:16.957 --> 17:19.523
You're trying to hire
this hot, sexy woman

17:19.525 --> 17:23.126
Even though you ow
it would destroy lem.

17:23.127 --> 17:24.861
Yes, I think you're sexy.

17:24.862 --> 17:27.329
Yes, I don't have
a lot of grown-up drinks,

17:27.329 --> 17:30.098
And, yes,
I wish I had a third yes.

17:30.099 --> 17:32.800
And, yes, I don't.

17:34.000 --> 17:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:41.147 --> 17:42.414
Hey.

17:42.415 --> 17:44.217
Ted. What a surprise.

17:44.218 --> 17:46.252
You missed
a good meeting today.

17:46.253 --> 17:48.787
I lied in a loud voice
and then crushed the spirit

17:48.788 --> 17:51.089
The only honest man
in the room.

17:51.090 --> 17:52.957
Listen...

17:52.958 --> 17:54.892
I want to help you
with your lightbulb,

17:54.893 --> 17:57.628
And mean really
help you this time,

17:57.629 --> 18:00.530
Not get all pissy
and competitive.
Why?
Linda wonders suspiciously.

18:00.531 --> 18:03.633
'cause I realized tonight that
chasing the company's approval

18:03.634 --> 18:06.535
Has turned me into a childish,
approval-chasing butt-head.

18:06.536 --> 18:08.804
Those were phil's words
when I drove him home.

18:08.805 --> 18:11.740
He also accused me
of being blurry and spinny.

18:11.741 --> 18:13.908
Well, I haven't behaved
perfectly either,

18:13.909 --> 18:16.776
Linda says contritely.
Why are you talking like that?

18:16.777 --> 18:19.512
Because it makes it easier
for me to say I'sorry.

18:19.513 --> 18:22.782
Even though I have mostly
contempt for the company,

18:22.783 --> 18:25.083
It still felt nice when they
patted me on the head.

18:25.084 --> 18:27.352
And that made me act
all gloaty,

18:27.353 --> 18:29.688
Linda explained
explanatorily.

18:29.689 --> 18:31.489
Well, it's okay,

18:31.490 --> 18:33.457
Ted said, using his mouth.

18:33.458 --> 18:38.061
I'm glad we don't talk like this
all the time, he added.

18:44.568 --> 18:48.036
That can't be a 7,
or the sky would be green.

18:48.037 --> 18:50.972
Mom. What brings youo
the place where, as you say,

18:50.973 --> 18:53.340
"science bends over
and grabs its ankles"?

18:53.341 --> 18:56.743
I just wanted to see
what my son was up to.

18:56.744 --> 18:59.812
Why are you wasting your time
working on my stuff?

18:59.813 --> 19:02.681
Why don't you show me
what you're working on?

19:02.682 --> 19:05.984
Because you're gonna
think it's stupid.
I won't.

19:09.755 --> 19:13.957
Popcorn that pops
from the heat in your mouth.

19:13.958 --> 19:15.158
Huh.

19:15.159 --> 19:18.094
It's pretty cool, actually.

19:26.568 --> 19:29.537
I think I put too much in.

19:32.073 --> 19:34.574
Can I try one?
are you sure?

19:34.575 --> 19:37.210
It's fresh
from the crap factory.

19:41.147 --> 19:43.748
I like it.

19:43.749 --> 19:45.483
Really?

19:45.484 --> 19:49.052
I'm sorry I never
looked up at your satellite.

19:49.053 --> 19:52.689
It's okay. It's coming
around again in 2015.

19:52.690 --> 19:55.758
It's a date.
You bring the popcorn.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.427
Crocodiles!

19:58.428 --> 20:00.829
Oh! I was having a dream.

20:00.830 --> 20:04.132
The only thing I remember was
a curious lack of crocodiles,

20:04.133 --> 20:06.568
And so I began
to call out for them.

20:06.569 --> 20:09.870
Oh. Stella.

20:09.871 --> 20:12.172
Look at the boards.

20:12.173 --> 20:15.408
See how smart I am?
I taped three of them together.

20:15.409 --> 20:18.010
Who cares if you're smart?
You're great in the sack.

20:18.011 --> 20:19.211
Really?

20:22.576 --> 20:23.843
Eventually, working together,

20:23.877 --> 20:26.378
Linda and I found a solution
to her stinking bulb problem.

20:26.412 --> 20:28.413
I just wanted to say
thanks for mentoring me,

20:28.448 --> 20:30.948
But I can't keep faking
the crazy-confident thing.

20:30.983 --> 20:32.984
It's making me more crazy
than confident.

20:33.018 --> 20:34.451
That's fine, linda.

20:34.486 --> 20:37.354
You are weak and so will
never be a threat to me.

20:37.388 --> 20:40.456
That's perhaps
your greatest quality.
And I realized that
whether it's a giant,

20:40.490 --> 20:42.458
Multinational company
or your own mother,

20:42.492 --> 20:44.927
You should never chase
someone else's approval.

20:44.961 --> 20:47.896
Hey, ted, I heard you pitched in
on the lightbulb. Nice work.

20:47.931 --> 20:51.132
Really? You think so?
God, that felt good.
