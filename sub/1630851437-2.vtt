WEBVTT

00:17.976 --> 00:19.019
Taylor!

00:19.102 --> 00:22.939
-What? Bitch, I'm aggravated.
-Bowman, did you not hear what I said?

00:23.023 --> 00:24.733
We on lockdown regardless.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.985
No, I'm not on lockdown.

00:27.068 --> 00:29.487
Yes you are, she just said.
Even Bree's on lockdown.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.573
I'm not on no lockdown.
What am I on lockdown for?

00:32.157 --> 00:35.577
I'm telling you. Watch.
You not gonna pop your fucking door.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.078
Man, hold on.

00:47.172 --> 00:51.051
I'm just pissed off 'cause
now I'm on lockdown for nothing.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.429
We ain't even fight.

00:54.512 --> 00:57.515
What you go to do with anything?
Who you is?

00:57.599 --> 00:58.892
The bag went bad.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.810
-Now nobody ain't getting it.
-Deputy!

01:01.728 --> 01:04.314
And now I got to stay
in here for 23 hours,

01:04.397 --> 01:07.776
come out for an hour, every day
until they feel like letting me out.

01:09.527 --> 01:11.237
It's like we're in a box,

01:11.321 --> 01:13.990
and then we come out off lockdown
and we're in a bigger box.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.785
And then you go back on lockdown
and you're in a small box again.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.244
I mean…

01:19.287 --> 01:22.415
this is no way
for anybody to have to live.

01:22.499 --> 01:23.500
Okay, so,

01:24.250 --> 01:26.878
Miss Jamie is gonna be written up.

01:26.961 --> 01:29.589
17 is gonna be written up,
16 is gonna be written up.

01:29.672 --> 01:33.009
-And also 19 is gonna be written up.
-Miss Magen is gonna be written up.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.554
So then we gonna let the disciplinarian
determine what they gonna get.

01:36.638 --> 01:40.433
They come off,
they go longer, 15, 10 days.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.893
-Half--
-The board will decide.

01:41.976 --> 01:44.020
-So that's their disciplinarian Monday.
-Monday.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.272
So they'll be on lockdown until that day.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.234
Like I give a fuck about lockdown.

02:04.666 --> 02:05.834
Good morning.

02:19.055 --> 02:23.518
We got at least five females
on lockdown right now in three parts.

02:23.601 --> 02:28.481
The four ladies plus
one of the fighters from last night.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.526
This is not a job for me,
this is my passion.

02:31.609 --> 02:34.279
Me, I love a challenge.
I love a challenge.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.869
And just like that, bye.

02:40.952 --> 02:45.039
-Why? Why it gotta be me?
-Is why-- is bye. Thank you.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.042
Come on, let's go. Come on.

02:48.126 --> 02:51.421
I ain't gonna take all day, bro.
This is not Burger King.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.007
It's not Burger King, "have it your way."

02:54.090 --> 02:56.384
I been here, like, 19 years.

02:56.467 --> 02:57.886
I'm more like a mother figure.

02:58.678 --> 03:02.182
Once I get mad, it's over with.
I'm serious.

03:02.265 --> 03:05.143
Find you something safe,
and let me deal with this cell.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.353
-Back up.
-I am safe, I'm not around y'all.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.647
Well you need to go get
your Snickers, let it satisfy you.

03:10.231 --> 03:13.276
Lieutenant Picard is like that inner
person that you wanna let out,

03:13.359 --> 03:15.028
but you don't, because you're controlled,

03:15.111 --> 03:17.572
but she don't control that person.
She that person.

03:17.655 --> 03:20.742
And y'all know,
once this jacket come off, it's over with.

03:21.326 --> 03:24.162
Me personally, I try to run my floor

03:24.245 --> 03:26.623
like I run my household.
It's very structured.

03:26.706 --> 03:27.957
Ah-ah-ah.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.126
You came up here, finish up that walk.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.836
It's all about control.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.340
If you can maintain your control
in your pod, you have no problem.

03:35.423 --> 03:38.259
That cell better be right
before that door get popped open.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.470
I'm coming through
looking for spring cleaning.

03:40.553 --> 03:43.848
-Does she know what spring cleaning mean?
-I don't know. I'm about to teach her.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.226
-Like a tag team.
-It is.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.477
It's like a tag team duo.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.354
She's the fire, I'm the ice.

03:49.437 --> 03:52.315
Or sometimes I might be fire
and she might be the ice.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.235
So we kind of… complement each other.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.071
How you do a "Q" sign?
I be trying to tell Qwan I love him.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.280
I be like…

03:59.364 --> 04:00.240
Like that?

04:00.365 --> 04:01.574
You could do it like that.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.202
-It depends on what you saying.
-Or down. It's a little G.

04:05.954 --> 04:09.165
Oh, you heard that, huh?
They sign languagin' on your floor.

04:09.791 --> 04:10.625
I'm snitchin'.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.794
Oh, but guess what.
I'm catching on to all your slangs.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.379
You could best believe that.

04:14.462 --> 04:15.338
You don't know that.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.714
Watch me.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.384
Look at her. Talking about,
"Watch me." Look at her.

04:19.467 --> 04:22.345
What this is, "west side"? Wait.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.471
You're not in LA.

04:23.554 --> 04:25.348
-See, this is how you do it.
-You're not in LA.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.141
Oh, I know it was something
y'all be doing.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.727
This is N-O. Not L-A.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.190
Y'all are a special bunch of ladies,
I swear y'all are.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.276
Let nobody else tell y'all
nothing different.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.613
What happened between Magen and Jamie

04:40.697 --> 04:42.991
and Harley and all them and…

04:43.074 --> 04:44.200
All right, so…

04:44.284 --> 04:45.785
I think Taylor too, yeah.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.372
Magen's dumb ass puts money on--

04:49.455 --> 04:51.332
-Jamie's books.
-Jamie's books.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.835
'Cause she can't order commissary
because she's on lockdown.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.838
Taylor's like, "She'll probably fight you,
but she ain't gonna fight me."

04:56.921 --> 04:58.464
-And she--
-Magen was gonna fight.

05:00.091 --> 05:00.967
I don't know.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.511
No, but she should have never
put that money on the books.

05:03.594 --> 05:06.597
-That was stupid from the get-go.
-Jamie's a shysty--

05:06.681 --> 05:09.225
I hate to say it, I mean,
I love her to death, whatever,

05:09.309 --> 05:11.352
but she's institutionalized,
you know what I mean?

05:11.436 --> 05:13.730
You can tell that's
how she lives on the outside and in.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.857
That's all she does is hustle.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.614
I don't want that.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.742
I just want this out of my cell.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.535
And I want some ice.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.078
-You don't want this?
-No.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.580
Give it to Harley.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.710
I'm just ready to get
my fucking life together

05:36.294 --> 05:38.129
and get the fuck out of here.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.341
I'm fucking 28 years old,
but I don't feel 28.

05:42.091 --> 05:44.802
I feel fucking 48.

05:44.886 --> 05:48.848
But I've made decisions like

05:49.349 --> 05:50.391
I'm eight.

05:57.148 --> 06:00.860
I'm in here for
two aggravated assaults with a firearm,

06:00.943 --> 06:02.987
illegal firing of a weapon,

06:03.071 --> 06:04.947
home invasion,

06:05.031 --> 06:06.324
burglary,

06:06.407 --> 06:09.577
and violating two restraining orders,

06:09.660 --> 06:12.246
aggravated criminal property damage.

06:13.122 --> 06:16.209
I don't know, my life is just
in shambles right now.

06:16.834 --> 06:20.046
It's like shit just go, just go bad, like,

06:20.838 --> 06:21.714
instant.

06:22.757 --> 06:26.010
But we be stuck
'cause we don't got no help.

06:26.677 --> 06:30.848
New Orleans is gruesome and heartbreaking.

06:30.932 --> 06:36.396
Either our family on drugs
or we on drugs trying to cope with shit.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.148
I… I lost…

06:39.232 --> 06:41.442
My daddy was murdered,
my step-daddy was murdered,

06:41.526 --> 06:43.528
my brother was murdered.

06:43.611 --> 06:44.445
Like,

06:44.529 --> 06:48.491
that's just not right, like,
and it's just fucked up.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.621
This is the first time I really
came to jail for something serious

06:53.704 --> 06:59.210
and I'm just praying I could just
go home on probation

06:59.293 --> 07:00.962
without doing no jail time.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.631
I wanna get out, I wanna go back to school

07:04.382 --> 07:07.051
and I wanna write books and

07:07.135 --> 07:10.138
fucking photography, and take pictures of

07:11.180 --> 07:15.268
anything that I feel catch my eye
that I like to look at.

07:15.810 --> 07:19.105
And raise my children, like,

07:19.188 --> 07:21.566
and just be a parent full-time.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.986
I have two daughters,
so they bring them every month

07:25.069 --> 07:28.072
and we just spend like
two, three hours with them.

07:28.156 --> 07:32.618
We eat, we do activities,
and you know, we just bond.

07:33.494 --> 07:37.665
Girl Scouts is just like another form
of visitation, but it's like,

07:37.748 --> 07:40.084
I could hug them,
I could touch them, you know,

07:40.168 --> 07:43.463
instead of just talking on the phone
through a screen.

07:43.546 --> 07:47.633
I'm not gonna be able to go
this week' cause of all this.

07:48.551 --> 07:52.513
It's aggravating. I'm ready to just go,
I'm ready to get this shit over with.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.688
We're gonna have a hearing,
a disciplinary hearing.

08:00.771 --> 08:04.567
We're gonna have the offender
step in at this moment.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.027
-Good morning.
-Have a seat.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.404
Good morning, Miss Ellis.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.364
-How you doing?
-You're before disciplinary board

08:10.448 --> 08:12.950
for an incident that happened
on January 16th, 2020.

08:13.034 --> 08:13.868
Yes, ma'am.

08:13.951 --> 08:16.913
The charges you are being--
have been accused of…

08:16.996 --> 08:19.624
possession of another person's property,

08:19.707 --> 08:21.626
providing staff with false information,

08:21.709 --> 08:24.003
interfering with the duties
of a staff member, and

08:24.086 --> 08:26.214
property theft from another person.

08:26.797 --> 08:29.550
How do you plead with
those charges, Miss Taylor?

08:29.634 --> 08:30.676
Not guilty.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.761
All three?

08:31.844 --> 08:32.887
Yup.

08:32.970 --> 08:35.890
So, I plead not guilty to, um,

08:35.973 --> 08:37.600
-Providing staff?
-Providing staff with--

08:37.683 --> 08:38.809
false information.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.853
And you plead guilty to the other three?

08:40.937 --> 08:41.979
Yes, ma'am.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.481
She could serve up to three,

08:43.564 --> 08:47.318
as the minimum days,
and up to 15 days on segregation.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.695
I say three, just because
they put the stuff in her cell.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.365
So you have three days' credit
for time served.

08:52.448 --> 08:55.159
-So that means you get off today.
-So today will be your last day.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.620
-Oh, yes, ma'am. Thank y'all.
-You're welcome.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.373
Do we want to give her the minimum?

09:00.456 --> 09:02.458
-Yes.
-The minimum, which is three days.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.044
You already served, today's your last day.
You'll be off tomorrow.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.337
Thank you.

09:07.588 --> 09:08.923
Have a seat over there.

09:13.302 --> 09:14.971
Miss Hall, good morning.

09:15.054 --> 09:15.888
Good morning.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.516
The charges you are accused of…

09:19.684 --> 09:20.560
Just one?

09:20.643 --> 09:23.771
Interfering with duties of a staff member.

09:23.854 --> 09:25.856
How do you plead with that one charge?

09:25.940 --> 09:27.108
-Guilty.
-Guilty?

09:31.445 --> 09:33.739
I feel like she should do--
finish her time,

09:33.823 --> 09:35.324
-That she already has.
-Okay.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.744
Since she tried to beat the system,
and we could add…

09:40.621 --> 09:43.165
I think, five more days to that time.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.458
I agree.

09:45.835 --> 09:46.836
Lieutenant?

09:47.420 --> 09:48.379
I agree.

09:50.006 --> 09:53.634
Do you understand? You have
the remainder of the prior incident.

09:53.718 --> 09:54.552
Mm-hmm.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.971
And then you have
five more days added to that.

09:58.055 --> 09:58.889
Okay.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.100
Thank you, ma'am.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.106
I would have talked my way
out of all this whole thing.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.150
-Good on you.
-That, I'd have backfooted out of it.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.694
I just hate when they just
lay down and not fight.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.821
Like, give me a good argument. The men?

10:13.904 --> 10:16.115
-The men will argue off your drawers.
-Yeah.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.662
Miss Evans, how do you plead
with your charges?

10:21.746 --> 10:22.955
Guilty with a statement.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.498
Go ahead with your statement.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.834
Yes, ma'am, all that happened,
but listen, uh,

10:26.917 --> 10:29.545
at first I did lie to Miss Picard
and Miss Steele, but in the end,

10:29.629 --> 10:31.213
didn't I tell the truth?

10:31.297 --> 10:32.923
-She did.
-I did tell the truth.

10:33.007 --> 10:36.093
I told them, "I feel bad for lying
to y'all, let me tell y'all the truth."

10:36.177 --> 10:37.011
Okay.

10:37.094 --> 10:37.970
And, uh,

10:38.054 --> 10:41.641
Bartholomew had money put on her books
week before last by inmate Hall.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.059
To make store for her.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.061
So let's tell it all.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.354
Yes, let's tell it all.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.022
Let's get it all out there in the open.

10:48.105 --> 10:49.815
You gave up a name.

10:49.899 --> 10:50.733
Oh, well.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.234
Why?

10:52.318 --> 10:53.486
Just to be dirty.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.201
This is my first report.
Can you put a little leniency on me?

11:00.284 --> 11:02.703
-I will try.
-All right, thank you.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.121
-Have a seat.
-No, you have a seat.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.831
Well, that's how you do it at St. Gabriel.

11:05.915 --> 11:06.999
Good, but it's not over.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.209
This is Orleans Parish.

11:08.292 --> 11:09.210
Mm-mm. So,

11:09.293 --> 11:11.253
we're gonna find you guilty
of the three charges.

11:11.337 --> 11:15.174
The max of the time
that you can serve for this is 15 days.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.052
Do you think she deserves 15 max?

11:19.553 --> 11:22.848
-I would go half of the 15.
-Okay, we'll do seven.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.017
So I get the max?

11:25.101 --> 11:26.727
-That's half.
-Max would have been 15.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.021
-Everybody else got three days.
-You-- Your part

11:29.105 --> 11:31.065
-and their part was different.
-It's different.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.191
Your charges are different.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.360
Looks like you're gonna be seven days.

11:34.443 --> 11:35.653
Credit for time served…

11:35.736 --> 11:37.613
-I won't tell the truth no more.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.198
Yes, you will.

11:39.281 --> 11:41.826
-Keep telling the truth.
-If you don't, you would have had 15.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.996
So you're not thankful
for the seven days you haven't got--

11:46.080 --> 11:47.665
-Not at all.
-No?

11:47.748 --> 11:50.251
-Bye, Miss Evans. Let her go.
-I think you're good.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.505
I want Bartholomew investigated.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.382
10-4.

11:56.465 --> 11:57.800
What you all gonna do with her?

11:57.883 --> 11:58.968
-I don't know.
-Jesus!

12:00.261 --> 12:02.596
-She's loud. You hear her?

12:02.680 --> 12:05.766
She's a very loud person,
for a person so small.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.395
So what you wanna do?
You wanna just do wraps

12:09.478 --> 12:11.981
-instead of potato logs?
-No, we're doing potato logs too.

12:12.064 --> 12:12.982
We're doing all this?

12:13.065 --> 12:14.024
-Yeah.
-Okay.

12:15.317 --> 12:18.404
-Hot pickle juice with Kool-Aid.
-Okay, so it's sweet pickle?

12:18.487 --> 12:20.865
Sausage, tuna…

12:20.948 --> 12:22.158
-All right.
-…hot pickle.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.410
And this is my trash, cause I'm trifling.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.203
Hot pickle, what's with that?

12:26.287 --> 12:29.331
-You don't like spicy?
-I love spicy, I'm from the South, babe.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.624
-You like me.
-All right.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.169
They got knives upstate?

12:33.252 --> 12:36.505
-No. In St. Gabriel.
-Where'd you come from?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.591
I was in work release in,
um, Lake Charles.

12:38.674 --> 12:41.635
Work release ain't really where
it's at, though, no more.

12:41.719 --> 12:46.098
Them people work you like a dog and
disrespect you every chance they get.

12:46.182 --> 12:49.727
Escaping work release was probably
one of the best things I did.

12:49.810 --> 12:52.062
-I needed to get out.
-You see a chance and got to go.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.191
I was a runaway a lot.
I ran away a lot.

12:55.274 --> 12:58.068
Get out of Juvenile, run.
Break up with a boyfriend, run.

12:58.861 --> 13:02.448
Once I got in foster care--
I hated foster homes. Couldn't stand them.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.200
So, I ran away.

13:07.661 --> 13:10.164
I lost a finger and everything,
running from the police.

13:10.247 --> 13:11.916
I lost all feeling in it.

13:11.999 --> 13:14.543
Maggots came out my finger
before I got it cut off

13:14.627 --> 13:17.671
'cause I was scared to go to the hospital,
because of the police.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.884
So, how did you escape?

13:21.967 --> 13:24.970
-From, um, work release.
-Girl, listen,

13:25.054 --> 13:26.472
-you just…

13:26.555 --> 13:30.518
We had a window in my bedroom,
and then I took some Klonopin.

13:30.601 --> 13:31.811
-Ooh!
-And,

13:31.894 --> 13:35.189
in my mind, I'm telling my loaded self,

13:35.272 --> 13:37.316
"Am, you can make it out of
a second story window."

13:39.068 --> 13:42.488
Like the asshole I was, on Klonopin,
I jumped out the window.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.491
Took off running.
I jumped two barbed wire fences,

13:46.075 --> 13:47.993
ran through the woods,

13:48.077 --> 13:50.538
was cut up from all the thorn bushes.

13:50.621 --> 13:53.666
I made it to a little gas station,
and, um, some man pulled up

13:53.749 --> 13:56.919
and I told him that my old man
just beat the shit out of me and--

13:57.002 --> 13:58.796
-Hmm. You're running.

13:58.879 --> 14:02.258
…that I took off running,
and he brought me to the bus station,

14:02.341 --> 14:04.385
gave me some money to get a bus ticket,

14:05.261 --> 14:07.513
and I made it all the way
down here overnight.

14:10.641 --> 14:14.103
That reminds me of something I did
years ago, it was so stupid.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.438
-Tell me. Come on, tell me.
-But I got away with it.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.732
After Katrina,

14:18.816 --> 14:20.651
a guy staying across from me,

14:20.734 --> 14:22.236
he had a stolen truck.

14:23.821 --> 14:26.490
He had a stolen truck off
the showroom floor.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.158
The boy next door?

14:28.242 --> 14:29.869
The boy across the hall.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.831
He had a stolen truck off the showroom,
'cause after Katrina, they did that.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.416
-They took trucks.
-Yeah.

14:35.499 --> 14:37.167
-I mean, and just went wherever.
-Yeah.

14:37.251 --> 14:41.297
It even had the things that hold the tire
from moving in the back of the truck.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.508
He said, "You can use my truck."
I went and took his fucking truck,

14:44.592 --> 14:46.844
and I took off to Tallahassee.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.140
-It was a stolen truck already.
-Yeah.

14:51.223 --> 14:54.310
-You re-stole the stolen truck?
-Re-stole the stolen truck.

14:55.561 --> 14:59.690
And I just-- I get paranoid because
I saw a cop, um, circle.

14:59.773 --> 15:04.695
Well, I pull over and I fucking just
walk out the truck and leave it.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.655
Well, I saw a park with a pond.

15:06.739 --> 15:10.200
I jumped in that fucking pond, took off
my pants, and I ran into a guy sitting

15:10.284 --> 15:13.787
and said, "This guy was trying to rape me.
Please, can you bring me to my hotel?"

15:13.871 --> 15:16.707
And he fucking did it,
that's why it reminded me of that.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.168
That was crazy. That was wild.

15:19.251 --> 15:22.379
And I ended up getting caught--

15:22.463 --> 15:25.799
I had cocaine in my hotel room.
Ended up getting caught with that cocaine,

15:25.883 --> 15:28.677
and that's what got me
in the trouble I was in to go to prison.

15:29.595 --> 15:33.307
Well, just think about it.
The shit that we done and did--

15:33.390 --> 15:35.142
Man, I'm lucky I didn't get killed.

15:38.520 --> 15:39.939
Pill call, ladies.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.775
Get out and have a cup of water
ready for the officer.

15:42.858 --> 15:43.901
Pill call.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.612
Well, I'm ready right here.
I'm the first one.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.950
I'm just here to get my meds, Miss Levar.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.454
I got to make sure that
they're taking their medicine,

15:55.537 --> 15:58.832
make sure that they're not
trying to hover it, or you know,

15:58.916 --> 16:01.710
put it in their cells or, you know,
do whatever with it.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.962
I just need my BuSpar.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.381
-My anxiety's bad.
-Yeah, I'll bet it is.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.468
A 30 milligram BuSpar
is just, like, the hot thing.

16:09.593 --> 16:12.972
-Ah!
-It's a non-narcotic anxiety pill.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.809
So what it makes you feel like is like
you just smoked a bunch of weed.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.397
I get my own BuSpars
three times a day, and then

16:21.480 --> 16:23.107
I get other people's during the day too.

16:23.691 --> 16:24.525
You got it?

16:24.608 --> 16:26.318
You gonna give me a little bit?

16:26.402 --> 16:28.028
Yeah, I buy other people's medication.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.906
She said she got a 30 for sale

16:31.532 --> 16:32.658
for two snacks.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.411
30 milligram BuSpar cost two snacks,

16:35.494 --> 16:37.955
which is usually like a noodle and a chip.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.040
I get BuSpars.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.334
And I don't like taking them,
I don't really need them,

16:42.418 --> 16:43.669
so I sell them.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.130
Ah, ha, ha!

16:46.714 --> 16:48.173
If they want my pills,

16:48.257 --> 16:50.509
they got to have something
I'm interested in.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.761
Like maybe braid my hair.

16:53.929 --> 16:57.433
I keep my towel game up, you know, soap.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.643
I take commissary, of course.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.521
Anything I want and they got,
I'mma get it.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.565
Okay. Candace.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.568
This my girl.

17:08.235 --> 17:09.528
Life here is,

17:09.611 --> 17:12.865
just do whatever you have to do
to get through to the next day.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.827
Whether it be snorting BuSpars,
talking in the toilet,

17:17.661 --> 17:21.415
whatever it is
that gets you through till tomorrow

17:21.498 --> 17:26.211
without shedding a tear, without breaking,
without letting this place break you.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.963
That-- That's what it's about.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.722
I got a possession of crack charge.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.933
Uh, my very first felony
that I've had since, ever.

17:40.017 --> 17:43.437
Right now, I'm here
on a parole violation.

17:43.520 --> 17:47.107
I got caught with a bottle of Xanax
and I've got my second felony.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.568
Yeah. In less than a year.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.445
Hold on, let me go grab it for you.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.489
Hold on.

17:54.656 --> 17:57.743
I know everybody.
I wheel and deal with everybody.

17:59.244 --> 18:02.873
Diamond, downstairs,
she wanted a BuSpar, so

18:02.956 --> 18:06.085
I went and asked Candace
if she had a BuSpar.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.045
She gave me
a little piece of one in my hand

18:08.128 --> 18:10.631
so I'm walking down the stairs,
and Miss Stevenson saw it

18:10.714 --> 18:12.424
and was like, "What's in your hand?"

18:12.508 --> 18:13.759
Huh? It's--

18:14.718 --> 18:15.594
Uh…

18:16.386 --> 18:18.013
I'm coming.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.770
I walked towards her
but I dropped it on the floor

18:24.853 --> 18:26.605
right underneath the chairs.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.818
You throwed it on the floor?

18:30.901 --> 18:33.070
Girl, what? Baby, I didn't throw nothing.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.365
-All right.
-All right.

18:38.158 --> 18:41.954
I just got caught,
so I got to go pick it up off the floor.

18:43.330 --> 18:44.289
All right?

18:45.249 --> 18:46.708
-By Stevenson.
-Oh!

18:47.709 --> 18:49.670
So give me a second, okay?

18:51.046 --> 18:51.880
Tsk.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.633
Yeah, you heard it?

18:54.716 --> 18:56.844
Oh, you about to do
designs on her head?

18:58.011 --> 18:59.096
Know what I'm saying?

18:59.596 --> 19:01.431
Is this yours or hers?

19:01.557 --> 19:04.059
All right, can I have some of yours?
Just a sip.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.319
Huh?

19:14.778 --> 19:16.113
Over there by the chairs.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.010
Huh? By Diamond.

19:43.849 --> 19:44.933
You got it?

19:45.017 --> 19:45.934
All right.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.272
-Girl, I just got busted.
-What are you talking about?

19:50.355 --> 19:52.900
She said, "What you got in your hand?"
I said, "thunk."

19:52.983 --> 19:53.817
Fingers.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.486
Fingers. I said, "What you wanna see?
Nothing? Nothing?"

19:56.570 --> 19:58.614
"Oh, girl, I'm not stupid."

19:58.697 --> 20:01.241
I'm gonna try to get up
in my cell real fast.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.951
-So I can get that--
-Me, too.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.412
-Heather.
-Yeah.

20:05.495 --> 20:06.496
Come here.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.710
So, what you really did
when you went down there?

20:11.793 --> 20:13.962
I went and I got a Tylenol
and I gave one--

20:14.046 --> 20:16.423
But you can't do that.
You supposed to take all your pills.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.342
Okay. Don't-- Don't lock me down.

20:18.425 --> 20:20.177
I gotta-- You gotta lock down.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.350
I mean, I told you the truth.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.518
You told me the truth,
but that's not the point.

20:28.602 --> 20:32.314
Okay, so what's gonna happen?
I'm gonna be on lockdown all day?

20:32.397 --> 20:33.690
You writing me up?

20:34.983 --> 20:36.443
Ugh!

20:37.903 --> 20:39.696
What the fuck?

20:39.780 --> 20:44.826
I never thought that I would be
34 years old in this place, like…

20:47.287 --> 20:48.538
It's surreal.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.297
You learned your lesson?

20:57.381 --> 20:58.340
Yeah.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.843
-For real?
-For real.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.679
So when you come out, what you gonna do?

21:03.762 --> 21:05.472
What's your changes?

21:05.555 --> 21:06.640
Ooh.

21:06.723 --> 21:11.186
I'm not gonna put my money
on crackhead's books ever again.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.733
But you the one who started this,
to be honest with you.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.694
Trying to beat the system. Let's say that.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.196
I paid her to do something for me.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.324
But you know it wasn't--
You trusted in her?

21:25.033 --> 21:26.410
She did it last week.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.537
Oh, really? Hmm, okay.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.955
-News I can use.
-You know what?

21:30.038 --> 21:33.083
-See what I'm doing, Picard?
-Oh, that's so nice, Jamie.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.043
-So you can take a break.
-You know what, though?

21:35.127 --> 21:37.963
You could have been doing all that
and you wouldn't have did what you did.

21:38.046 --> 21:40.132
All right, and I told you
the truth, didn't I?

21:40.215 --> 21:42.718
Something inside of me was like,
man, just tell her the truth.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.387
Don't lie to Picard.
Picard don't ever do you wrong.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.680
I never-- I helps!

21:46.763 --> 21:48.724
Right. Can I apologize to Magen?

21:50.100 --> 21:53.103
To me, to be honest with you,
it takes a woman to apologize.

21:53.186 --> 21:56.148
-What I say, what you want me to do?
-No, don't do it because I want you to.

21:56.231 --> 21:58.567
-You got to be within your heart.
-All right.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.861
-And you got to be sincere.
-All right, come here.

22:00.944 --> 22:02.904
Man, listen, listen, listen!

22:02.988 --> 22:04.489
I don't even wanna be the bitch,

22:04.573 --> 22:07.284
but listen, I don't want
to hear this shit. For real.

22:07.367 --> 22:08.452
She a straight flock.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.746
So you don't want her
to apologize, Magen?

22:10.829 --> 22:11.997
She a flock!

22:12.080 --> 22:13.248
She can't fuck with me.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.792
She not-- Listen, I don't want to hear it.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.211
So, there's something you really
wanted to apologize,

22:18.295 --> 22:20.464
-or you just doing it to be doing it?
-Just to do it.

22:20.547 --> 22:23.258
-If you're not sincere, then go ahead.
-I'm sincere with you!

22:23.967 --> 22:26.511
-Right, but why--
-That's all that matters, right?

22:33.185 --> 22:34.019
Julie!

22:40.650 --> 22:41.818
Heather.

22:42.486 --> 22:45.113
Miss Stevenson is on one today.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.865
I was getting a BuSpar,

22:46.948 --> 22:49.159
Candace just handed it to me.

22:49.242 --> 22:52.079
And she's like, "Heather, come here."
Girl, I dropped it.

22:52.162 --> 22:55.707
But I went back and picked it up
and she followed me.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.667
I told her I gave her a Tylenol.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.795
You can get Tylenol on commissary.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.214
-So…
-Oh, fuck.

23:02.297 --> 23:04.466
And she's writing me up.

23:04.549 --> 23:08.261
-How long do you think I'm gonna be here?
-You get…

23:10.138 --> 23:14.601
Um, if she writes you up, you can get,
you can get 30 fucking days for it.

23:14.684 --> 23:16.186
I hope it's not that long.

23:16.269 --> 23:18.730
Clean your room up
cause they might do a shakedown on us.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.482
-Huh?
-Get rid of all your straws and shit

23:20.565 --> 23:22.234
-and clean your room.
-All right.

23:22.317 --> 23:24.361
I got to go get something out of my room.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.532
Fuck it, it is what it is, baby.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.205
Well, I have everything in the world.

23:35.288 --> 23:38.333
I have a great man, I have, um,
a brand-new car at home,

23:38.417 --> 23:39.543
I've got my own house.

23:39.626 --> 23:41.962
I've got all the money in the world,

23:42.504 --> 23:44.840
and, I just can't get it right.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.677
And it's just me being an addict.

23:49.970 --> 23:52.347
I can't deal with everyday life.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.268
I've been an addict since I was 14.

23:58.228 --> 23:59.479
Born in Chicago.

23:59.563 --> 24:02.149
I was raised there
until I was about eight.

24:02.232 --> 24:06.945
Um, me and my mom
don't have the best relationship,

24:07.028 --> 24:10.782
so, um, I was sent down to Biloxi
to live with my father,

24:10.866 --> 24:14.911
and um, my-- I mean, I got in a lot of
trouble growing up as a kid.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.294
I started hopping trains
and, like, traveling.

24:22.377 --> 24:24.713
You know, coming from Biloxi down here,

24:24.796 --> 24:28.133
um, the Mardi Gras after the hurricane
I hopped my first train.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.220
And to be honest with you,

24:32.304 --> 24:34.848
I moved down here
because I was a heroin addict

24:34.931 --> 24:38.602
and there was no heroin in Mississippi,
so I moved down here where it was.

24:42.564 --> 24:47.110
I want to be able to stay out of jail and

24:47.194 --> 24:49.154
stay sober and be okay.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.615
How do you do that?

24:52.449 --> 24:53.575
I don't know.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.078
You know? It's hard.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.125
Thanks.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.843
-What is it?
-It's Jambalaya.

25:11.927 --> 25:12.802
Let me see!

25:18.767 --> 25:20.352
-You want some pap?
-No.

25:22.020 --> 25:27.108
I will be leaving in less than
48 hours on almost a year incarceration.

25:27.984 --> 25:30.529
I'm nervous, but I'm very excited.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.489
Laura, since you're my monkey,

25:32.572 --> 25:34.574
you approve of this message, correct?

25:36.034 --> 25:37.327
-Message?
-Our plans?

25:37.410 --> 25:38.495
-What message?
-For lockdown?

25:38.578 --> 25:40.664
-Yeah.
-Okay, just wanted to double-check.

25:40.747 --> 25:43.124
So, we might have a little, you know,

25:43.208 --> 25:45.919
going away party or whatever
to send me off.

25:46.962 --> 25:47.837
Robin.

25:47.921 --> 25:50.048
-Robin and--
-Me, you.

25:50.131 --> 25:52.217
-Ask Magen and Nancy.
-You're welcome.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.970
And you're more than
welcome to join us, but

25:55.804 --> 25:59.182
I don't know if you want to lock down
in our room for lockdown.

25:59.266 --> 26:00.433
We're allowed to do that?

26:00.517 --> 26:01.977
No, not necessarily.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.938
We have to make a dummy in our bed,
and we have to hide underneath

26:05.021 --> 26:07.107
the bed which is gonna kinda be a problem.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.609
You don't have to.
We're inviting you in case you wanna come.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.238
I have a million emotions right now,

26:13.321 --> 26:16.992
but I know that I have been
through things with these women

26:17.075 --> 26:19.828
that nobody's gonna be able to forget.

26:19.911 --> 26:22.455
I'm trying to get
a group of people in my room.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.165
Who else is sleeping over?

26:24.249 --> 26:25.083
Um,

26:25.166 --> 26:26.751
Robin is,

26:26.835 --> 26:27.669
and, um--

26:27.752 --> 26:28.837
Who's Robin?

26:30.672 --> 26:33.592
Last time I was in here, last year,

26:34.551 --> 26:36.052
I knew I wasn't gonna get it together.

26:37.345 --> 26:40.724
This time, it's a completely different…
a completely different vibe.

26:40.807 --> 26:42.934
Um, and when I get home,

26:44.227 --> 26:47.022
starting before I get home,
but really when I get home,

26:48.148 --> 26:49.357
I'm wiping my hands of it.

26:50.692 --> 26:54.070
My son, he's five.
He turned five January 1st.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.155
I'm 23,

26:55.238 --> 26:56.990
so I had him when I was 18.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.368
I need to change the way that I act.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.162
'Cause I always had that excuse.

27:02.245 --> 27:05.165
"Well, he's young, he won't remember.
He's young, he won't remember."

27:05.248 --> 27:06.750
Now, he's gonna remember.

27:07.584 --> 27:10.503
That's actually-- I wanna read something.
Can I read something?

27:10.587 --> 27:12.005
Can I get it from my folder?

27:13.590 --> 27:14.799
It's not really a poem,

27:14.883 --> 27:17.427
but it's a, like a-- just a piece.

27:18.178 --> 27:20.597
It says, "Mommy is sick.
She's at the doctor."

27:20.680 --> 27:23.141
"Mommy is at work.
Mommy is at Mom School."

27:23.767 --> 27:26.645
"Mommy can't lie anymore.
You're getting old enough to understand."

27:26.728 --> 27:28.897
"I'm in big girl timeout
for making bad choices."

27:28.980 --> 27:30.565
"I have to change my behavior."

27:31.358 --> 27:33.360
"My name is Harley Himbor
and I'm an addict."

27:33.443 --> 27:35.195
"My clean date is 1-1-20,

27:35.278 --> 27:37.822
and my drugs of choice are
crack cocaine, heroin, and meth."

27:37.906 --> 27:41.284
"I pray every day I make it home to my son
so he doesn't fall in my footsteps."

27:41.368 --> 27:44.245
"I love you, son.
I will fight my hardest for us."

27:48.166 --> 27:49.751
That made me feel like,

27:50.502 --> 27:51.711
"Okay, it's time."

27:51.795 --> 27:53.254
Like, I'm really ready.

27:53.338 --> 27:56.091
My friends are at their wit's end,
my parents are at their wit's end.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.134
Like, my sister's at her wit's end.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.261
Everybody's at their wit's end with me,

28:00.345 --> 28:05.266
and losing all these relationships
is not something I'm willing to

28:05.350 --> 28:09.979
forfeit for another five years
of partying, if I make it five years.

28:19.072 --> 28:21.157
Mellow!

28:21.950 --> 28:24.828
Oh my God!

28:25.745 --> 28:27.122
You heard him?

28:27.664 --> 28:29.082
Fu Fu!

28:32.252 --> 28:34.003
Hey, what's up girls?

28:38.425 --> 28:39.759
I was just yelling for Fu,

28:39.843 --> 28:41.678
and I guess they're out
in the yard of whatever,

28:41.761 --> 28:43.179
so I can hear him yelling right now.

28:43.263 --> 28:45.473
Yo!

28:45.557 --> 28:47.016
I love him!

28:47.100 --> 28:49.102
I miss him so much.

28:49.853 --> 28:50.979
Oh, man.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.524
Fu Fu!

28:54.607 --> 28:57.026
Do not stand in that window.

28:58.194 --> 28:59.195
My bad.

29:01.865 --> 29:04.409
I'm gonna go talk in the toilet now.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.497
Some guys play cards.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.916
Some guys watch TV.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.793
Some guys doing the phones.

29:14.461 --> 29:15.920
And some guys get in the toilet.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.133
You know, we guys,

29:20.216 --> 29:23.803
so we wanna hear a woman's voice.
You know, it's a sensual thing.

29:23.887 --> 29:25.054
What you doing?

29:25.805 --> 29:27.474
We've been talking for a few weeks.

29:27.557 --> 29:30.310
It's like, three or four weeks,
but it seems like longer than that.

29:32.979 --> 29:36.107
We don't have nothing to do
but talk all day, so we know, like,

29:36.191 --> 29:38.067
everything about each other.

29:38.151 --> 29:41.112
She's-- Her favorite food is
Mediterranean food.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.697
He's 29,

29:42.781 --> 29:45.658
he's tall. He's got some long, curly,

29:45.742 --> 29:47.285
good hair.

29:47.368 --> 29:51.372
She likes to listen to
um, rap, R&B, pop.

29:51.456 --> 29:54.250
I haven't really just seen him
up close and personal,

29:54.334 --> 29:56.795
but I've seen him
through the door and stuff.

29:56.878 --> 29:59.422
You start out as just friends.
You know, just conversation

29:59.506 --> 30:02.091
starting out as friends until, you know,
one thing leads to another.

30:03.676 --> 30:06.304
I love him because
he's helping me, like,

30:07.263 --> 30:09.599
forget about a lot of shit
that's going on.

30:09.682 --> 30:12.936
She's on a pretty, you know, bad charge.

30:14.938 --> 30:18.483
I was basically like living free,
doing what I wanted to do.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.737
I came with two
of my friend girls from Memphis,

30:22.821 --> 30:25.698
and we were just down here for Mardi Gras.

30:26.741 --> 30:29.410
You know, we were out drinking,
just having fun and

30:29.494 --> 30:33.540
supposed to be partying, and then
just one thing led to another, and,

30:34.290 --> 30:36.167
a situation occurred.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.837
New information in the murder of a tourist

30:38.920 --> 30:40.713
in a New Orleans hotel.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.715
62-year-old Patrick Murphy

30:42.799 --> 30:46.135
was a beloved businessman
and owner of Murphy Jewelers.

30:46.219 --> 30:50.598
An Empress Hotel worker found Murphy
in bed stabbed multiple times.

30:50.682 --> 30:54.894
The NOPD is now looking for this woman,
identified as Magen Hall,

30:54.978 --> 30:57.814
and she's wanted for second-degree murder.

30:59.148 --> 31:02.360
Second-degree murder is, uh--
carries up to life.

31:03.736 --> 31:06.614
I would be lying if I told you
I wasn't scared.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.909
I just gotta keep, you know,

31:09.993 --> 31:12.871
pushing and being strong
because I'd break down

31:12.954 --> 31:16.374
if I just wasn't mentally
strong enough for it.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.294
Man, it fucked me over.

31:19.377 --> 31:23.339
They told me I had to do
the rest of my 30 days, plus five.

31:23.423 --> 31:26.759
Goddamn. You know me, you let--

31:26.843 --> 31:30.013
She needs to be worrying about
the letters she about to get.

31:30.471 --> 31:31.347
Ray.

31:31.931 --> 31:33.892
That's what she needs
to be worrying about.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.060
-Letters?
-Letters.

31:36.603 --> 31:41.733
When an inmate says they have letters,
letters stands for life sentences.

31:41.816 --> 31:44.444
It's like, um, letters-- Life, L-I-F-E.

31:44.527 --> 31:47.280
Versus, an inmate says
numbers, that mean--

31:47.363 --> 31:49.824
Well, how many years
or how many months they have.

31:49.908 --> 31:53.995
So she-- She needs to be-- gonna focus
on that time she about to go look at.

31:54.078 --> 31:57.582
She says, you need to be worried
about them letters.

31:57.665 --> 32:00.501
She think I care 'cause she go
and tell her what I said…

32:00.585 --> 32:02.337
-I don't give two fucks.
-I don't give a fuck.

32:02.420 --> 32:05.006
I don't care if you care.
This is my mouth.

32:05.089 --> 32:07.800
I do what I want. I say what I want.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.594
-I'm not talking to you.
-This is my mouth.

32:09.677 --> 32:12.847
I'm not about to fuss with you.
I'm not about to fuss with you, man.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.224
Bitch, kill yourself. That's what you do.

32:15.308 --> 32:17.060
You stank, girl, you stank.

32:17.143 --> 32:19.604
That room stank,
everything about you stank.

32:19.687 --> 32:22.857
-Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

32:22.941 --> 32:27.111
-Check this girl's bag for a bomb!
-Bye. Good day.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.697
-Bye. Good day. Lockdown.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.574
-What I ask you to do?
-Listen!

32:31.658 --> 32:33.534
You're gonna go back,
what I ask you to do?

32:33.618 --> 32:35.536
-I'm about to go right now.
-Bye.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.291
I know where that's coming from.

32:40.375 --> 32:45.338
Taylor, she was talking through the toilet
with Fu Fu before I did that. So,

32:45.421 --> 32:48.257
she's just big old mad
and hating right now,

32:48.341 --> 32:50.301
so she's gonna say any and everything.

32:51.302 --> 32:54.430
You just got out of disciplinary.

32:54.514 --> 32:55.765
But listen.

32:55.848 --> 32:57.809
All right, she started with me.

32:57.892 --> 32:59.227
I didn't even say nothing.

32:59.310 --> 33:02.605
So there's no helping you, right? Tell me.
There's no helping you.

33:02.689 --> 33:04.232
So you gotta want help, okay?

33:04.315 --> 33:06.651
When you want it, let me know.
'Cause you don't want it.

33:06.734 --> 33:08.778
Magen, she wanna do the right thing,

33:08.861 --> 33:11.239
but somewhere down the line,
she just keep mixing up.

33:11.322 --> 33:15.243
She go right back
and do the same thing all over again.

33:15.326 --> 33:16.452
So keep listening.

33:16.536 --> 33:17.662
'Cause she keep on…

33:22.208 --> 33:24.335
You two going up to the wall
and start packing up.

33:24.419 --> 33:25.378
Taylor.

33:25.461 --> 33:28.047
We gonna move Taylor to eight at the top.

33:29.716 --> 33:34.012
So Magen and Taylor, you know,
they have been in trouble in their pods.

33:34.095 --> 33:37.223
So that means we have to move
all those ladies off of the 3-5's.

33:37.306 --> 33:39.058
-You ready?
-No!

33:39.934 --> 33:41.019
What's the problem?

33:41.102 --> 33:42.937
'Cause that shit maddening!

33:43.021 --> 33:45.815
Got me on lockdown mad as a motherfucker.

33:45.898 --> 33:47.734
I ain't even supposed to be on lockdown.

33:47.817 --> 33:50.570
I ain't talking about moving.
Not going no where.

33:50.653 --> 33:52.947
Girl, they're trying to make us
uncomfortable.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.241
Like they're trying to move us
where they want to move us,

33:55.324 --> 33:57.326
so we don't be comfortable
in our own little world.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.620
I don't give a fuck.
I'm gonna do what I want regardless.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.750
Me, I'm gonna do my time
the way I wanna do it.

34:09.297 --> 34:12.133
This been a lockdown cell all this time,

34:12.216 --> 34:14.218
-All of a sudden it's not a lockdown cell.
-Listen.

34:14.302 --> 34:17.013
For real, I didn't even
fucking do nothing.

34:19.515 --> 34:20.558
Listen…

34:20.641 --> 34:21.976
Then you said that. No!

34:22.060 --> 34:25.271
-Listen, are you moving or not?
-Man, no, I'm not moving!

34:25.354 --> 34:27.607
10-4. So look,
we're gonna do this one here.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.859
Close the door. Write her up.

34:31.861 --> 34:33.571
Girl Scouts, canceled.

34:33.654 --> 34:35.782
Man, they can't fucking
put me on lockdown!

34:35.865 --> 34:38.034
No, no, no, listen. Listen.

34:38.117 --> 34:41.746
-Not just now, Girl Scout is done.

34:42.872 --> 34:43.956
Put it in the report.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.792
What was that for?

34:47.043 --> 34:50.046
I got no fucks,
so don't fucking tell me that!

34:52.215 --> 34:53.424
Magen, come on.

34:53.508 --> 34:54.467
I'm not going.

34:54.550 --> 34:57.470
I'mma be real with you. I'm dead serious.

34:57.553 --> 35:00.807
-I don't want to leave Fu Fu.
-If I gotta move it, so be it.

35:01.808 --> 35:05.103
The one thing I had to, like,
take my mind off stuff,

35:05.186 --> 35:07.522
talking through the toilet with Fu Fu.

35:08.272 --> 35:13.361
Like, they're trying to like
take it away, so I'm very upset.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.948
Magen, come on. I don't have all day.

35:17.031 --> 35:19.033
Come on, I done give you enough chance.

35:19.617 --> 35:20.535
Magen!

35:22.328 --> 35:23.162
Magen!

35:23.871 --> 35:24.831
Hold up.

35:24.914 --> 35:26.499
Fu's on the toilet.

35:26.582 --> 35:27.458
He in there?

35:27.542 --> 35:28.543
What you want me to say?

35:28.626 --> 35:30.253
Man, tell him I'm leaving!

35:31.212 --> 35:33.840
She said to tell you that she leavin'.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.384
-Magen.
-Huh?

35:36.467 --> 35:38.886
Tell him I'm so for real.
He better make way.

35:38.970 --> 35:42.181
She's moving to E! You better make way.

35:42.265 --> 35:44.475
You really playing with our time now?

35:46.102 --> 35:50.273
I'm sorry that you gotta leave
your toilet person, but you gotta go.

35:56.362 --> 35:58.489
She was crying, though. She's upset.

35:59.574 --> 36:00.825
She don't wanna come over here.

36:01.784 --> 36:03.119
I don't blame her.

36:04.370 --> 36:07.039
She upset 'cause she ain't talking
to that boy in the toilet.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.342
Girl 'cause I'm going home tomorrow.

36:19.427 --> 36:20.261
-Hi.
-Hi.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.060
She coming?

36:28.144 --> 36:28.978
No.

36:30.855 --> 36:34.233
I want you to look next door
at how clean Robin's room is.

36:37.695 --> 36:39.280
Robin made a body.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.991
Looks like a body, but it's not her.
There's a book and everything.

36:47.580 --> 36:48.831
Who is it?

36:50.416 --> 36:52.418
Ooh, we're about to have fun.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.295
If we get caught?

36:54.378 --> 36:55.755
Lockdown.

36:55.838 --> 36:57.715
So it's a chance we're taking,

36:57.798 --> 36:59.800
but I think it's gonna pass.

37:09.185 --> 37:11.354
-Come help you make your bunk?
-I'mma tell 'em.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.481
All right.

37:14.774 --> 37:16.734
-All right, I can deal with that.
-Wait.

37:16.817 --> 37:18.736
We need something for the head.

37:18.819 --> 37:19.946
Oh.

37:20.029 --> 37:21.489
There you go.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.032
Mm-hmm.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.201
Oh, man!

37:27.245 --> 37:29.497
Sprinkle a little razzle-dazzle on that.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.082
I think that's good.

37:31.165 --> 37:33.501
That definitely looks like me. Yeah.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.169
I would say so.

37:39.465 --> 37:41.968
-Stop looking so suspicious.
-Don't. No.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.345
-'Cause your act-- Oh!

37:45.012 --> 37:47.014
-Pop my door.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.599
Hello!

37:48.683 --> 37:50.518
Nae, tell her to pop my door.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.771
Why did you do it so obvious?
You're a horrible criminal.

37:53.854 --> 37:55.273
-Bitch, she was looking.
-I know!

37:55.356 --> 37:56.482
You're a horrible criminal.

37:56.565 --> 37:57.942
Do not get me caught.

37:58.025 --> 37:59.777
Yeah, you were really bad at that.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.070
Hello!

38:04.198 --> 38:07.451
-I don't think she's hearing us.
-And Janae is trying to rat on us.

38:07.535 --> 38:08.661
-She's not.
-She is.

38:08.744 --> 38:09.829
Don't you think, um…

38:09.912 --> 38:12.373
No, she's not. I asked her to come.

38:12.456 --> 38:13.833
I'm positive she did it.

38:13.916 --> 38:16.002
She tried to get me
locked down last time.

38:16.085 --> 38:17.962
When she gets bored,
she'll do shit like that.

38:18.045 --> 38:20.089
Oh, no, I can't sing, babe.

38:20.172 --> 38:22.049
-Get out, Nancy.
-You gotta get out.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.303
I'm waiting to leave.
As soon as the door pops.

38:26.178 --> 38:27.513
I'm in 11.

38:28.514 --> 38:29.682
Yeah!

38:29.765 --> 38:31.517
We can't do nothing.

38:33.019 --> 38:33.936
Fuck.

38:36.355 --> 38:38.399
Harley, why you trying to
get out the cell?

38:39.442 --> 38:40.860
-What?
-Why you trying to get out?

38:40.943 --> 38:42.862
-I'm not trying to.
-What are you trying to do?

38:42.945 --> 38:43.779
Get her out.

38:43.863 --> 38:44.780
Yeah!

38:45.865 --> 38:48.284
-I thought she wanted to be in here.
-You didn't say nothing?

38:48.367 --> 38:49.535
Me?

38:49.618 --> 38:50.494
What I did?

38:53.080 --> 38:55.041
-Wait, what I did?
-I don't know.

38:55.124 --> 38:57.168
She thought you told on us
or some shit.

38:57.251 --> 38:59.211
-What's up?
-Who is she?

38:59.295 --> 39:00.713
-I'm out!
-Her?

39:01.964 --> 39:03.966
-Just myself.
-What you talking about?

39:04.050 --> 39:06.886
First off, I'm not no snitch.
I don't do with all that snitching.

39:06.969 --> 39:08.596
We already been through that.

39:08.679 --> 39:10.056
-I did 'cause--
-You did last time.

39:10.139 --> 39:13.184
I didn't snitch. That lady seen you.
What is you talking? Didn't snitch on you.

39:13.267 --> 39:14.435
Okay.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.896
-Old lady.
-Stupid ass, dunk ass.

39:16.979 --> 39:18.773
Why would you do that?

39:18.856 --> 39:21.442
You said it. You said it in front of her.

39:21.525 --> 39:22.485
Yeah.

39:23.069 --> 39:25.363
You went repeating what I said,
you're my friend.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.490
So you don't repeat
what I say to other people.

39:27.573 --> 39:29.658
You was talking about it in front of her!

39:29.742 --> 39:31.577
-Are you my friend of not?
-I wanted to know.

39:31.660 --> 39:33.204
-I wanted to know.
-Are you my friend?

39:33.287 --> 39:35.498
I wouldn't say something you said to me
to somebody else.

39:35.581 --> 39:36.916
I wanted to know.

39:36.999 --> 39:39.085
I wanted to know if it was true.

39:39.168 --> 39:43.798
Whatever. Five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

39:43.881 --> 39:45.049
Oh, God.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.681
Not how it was supposed to go.

39:52.765 --> 39:54.141
Where's Whitley at?

39:55.309 --> 39:57.311
-You don't wanna move?
-I don't.

39:58.521 --> 39:59.939
I hear a walkie-talkie.

40:00.022 --> 40:03.025
It's not Whitley's.
I'm telling you, she's gone.

40:03.109 --> 40:04.443
She's not in here.

40:04.527 --> 40:07.154
All right,
I heard the door close. I'll move.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.114
Okay.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.828
It can be all fun and games in here, and

40:14.662 --> 40:16.080
it's not.

40:16.163 --> 40:17.456
It's not.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.542
This place is not fun.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.796
I'm still young, I'm only 23 years old.

40:25.005 --> 40:28.801
I do want bigger and better things
for myself, and for my child.

40:30.010 --> 40:31.804
I'm very, um,

40:32.388 --> 40:33.848
worried about

40:33.931 --> 40:36.809
how my decisions
will affect him later in life

40:36.892 --> 40:38.519
if I don't get myself together.

40:39.019 --> 40:42.731
I'm just tired of being around so many
females in one place. It's too much!

40:42.815 --> 40:44.733
Too many personalities,
too much attitudes.

40:44.817 --> 40:47.319
Too much different opinions on things.

40:48.112 --> 40:50.030
Way too much fucking drama.

40:54.118 --> 40:55.453
It's time to get my life together.

40:56.370 --> 41:00.541
I don't tell anybody this because
I don't want them to think anything.

41:01.292 --> 41:04.211
Actually, my past is--

41:04.295 --> 41:06.422
My background is corrections.

41:07.798 --> 41:08.632
Yeah.

41:09.550 --> 41:10.634
How so?

41:10.718 --> 41:13.888
I was a deputy for two and a half years.

41:19.810 --> 41:20.644
Yeah.
