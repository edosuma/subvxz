WEBVTT

00:02.728 --> 00:05.713
(camera shutters snapping,
police chatter)

00:10.069 --> 00:12.368
GABRIEL REYES:
So you're saying you got home
at seven o'clock tonight?

00:12.370 --> 00:13.420
-OWEN: Yep.
-GABRIEL: And there
were no signs

00:13.572 --> 00:15.163
that an intruder
had been in the house?

00:15.241 --> 00:16.498
(sighs) Not until
we went upstairs.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.575
GABRIEL: Who else
has access to the place?

00:18.577 --> 00:23.171
Uh, my son TK, um,
Mateo, the landlady.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.840
Now, you all think
that this vandalism

00:25.918 --> 00:27.693
had something to do with
the attack at the Capitol?

00:27.770 --> 00:31.030
The message on the note
and the phrase painted
on the wall were similar.

00:31.181 --> 00:33.090
Both used the word "toxic."

00:33.108 --> 00:34.258
Well, it could be a coincidence,

00:34.276 --> 00:35.683
except I tend not
to believe in those.

00:35.761 --> 00:37.928
The fact that it was kept
in Strand's bedroom

00:37.930 --> 00:39.279
makes it seem personal.

00:39.431 --> 00:41.373
Can you think of anybody
who might be angry enough

00:41.525 --> 00:42.766
to do something like this?

00:42.785 --> 00:44.209
No. I'm a fairly beloved figure.

00:44.361 --> 00:45.769
I don't have any enemies.

00:45.771 --> 00:47.463
MATEO: Uh...

00:48.865 --> 00:50.365
W... What?

00:50.384 --> 00:52.109
What about that guy you punched?

00:52.111 --> 00:53.052
Deputy Chief Tyson?

00:53.203 --> 00:55.279
Oh, no. Billy and I are good.

00:55.297 --> 00:57.038
You punched the deputy chief?

00:57.058 --> 00:58.206
Wait, you punched someone else?

00:58.284 --> 01:00.450
-Sergeant O'Brien.
-Who's Sergeant O'Brien?

01:00.452 --> 01:02.227
Motorcycle cop.
Cap clocked him.

01:02.304 --> 01:04.045
You punched a police sergeant?

01:04.123 --> 01:05.064
He was not in uniform
at the time.

01:05.140 --> 01:06.381
He was wearing a number.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.457
A jersey.
He was wearing a jersey.

01:07.459 --> 01:09.293
But that's not who you meant.

01:09.311 --> 01:10.552
Uh, no.

01:10.646 --> 01:11.904
That was just some guy.

01:11.980 --> 01:14.798
-Recently?
-Two days ago.

01:14.800 --> 01:21.729
So recently you punched...
just some guy?

01:21.749 --> 01:22.748
That's right.

01:22.825 --> 01:24.083
You slug anyone else

01:24.234 --> 01:26.660
in the last, say, six months?

01:26.736 --> 01:28.754
Well, there was the deputy
from Kerr County.

01:28.905 --> 01:29.996
GABRIEL: Another cop?

01:30.149 --> 01:31.832
He was involved
in human trafficking.

01:31.908 --> 01:35.094
And my life and the life
of several others were at risk.

01:35.245 --> 01:36.578
You can ask Marjan.
She was there.

01:36.655 --> 01:38.246
Right. You're talking
about the Roy Griffin case?

01:38.324 --> 01:41.174
-Yes.
-Bad hombre.

01:41.251 --> 01:43.827
Word is he was working
with one of the cartels.

01:43.846 --> 01:46.105
He's in jail for murder.

01:48.016 --> 01:49.191
What?

01:51.019 --> 01:52.836
He is in jail, right?

01:52.838 --> 01:54.571
So about that...

01:57.267 --> 02:00.177
(theme music plays)

02:00.270 --> 02:01.862
Your Honor, this man is charged

02:02.014 --> 02:03.438
with kidnapping and murder.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.624
Defense's motion
to dismiss is laughable.

02:05.701 --> 02:09.461
Former Deputy Griffin
held a fire captain at gunpoint.

02:09.538 --> 02:11.463
He forced a roomful
of innocent people--

02:11.615 --> 02:12.447
Innocent people?

02:12.616 --> 02:13.690
You mean all those folks
who had just

02:13.801 --> 02:15.617
-illegally crossed the border?
-Your Honor--

02:15.694 --> 02:17.544
Let the prosecution
finish, counsel.

02:17.696 --> 02:20.213
He forced a roomful of people
into zip ties

02:20.366 --> 02:22.048
and according
to multiple accounts,

02:22.125 --> 02:24.309
was about to execute
Captain Strand,

02:24.386 --> 02:26.052
had Strand and his companions
not stopped him.

02:26.129 --> 02:27.721
That's one
interpretation of events.

02:27.873 --> 02:28.480
There's another?

02:28.632 --> 02:29.481
Sheriff's Deputy Griffin

02:29.633 --> 02:30.482
entered into a situation

02:30.651 --> 02:32.893
in which he was
dangerously outnumbered

02:32.969 --> 02:35.896
and could not possibly tell
the good guys from the bad.

02:36.048 --> 02:37.381
For all he knew, Captain Strand

02:37.399 --> 02:39.140
was the one engaged
in human trafficking.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.718
The unarmed man
your client gunned down,

02:41.737 --> 02:43.069
as witnessed
by another firefighter--

02:43.164 --> 02:46.832
The slug pulled from that victim
was too damaged to match.

02:46.983 --> 02:48.167
<i> Your Honor,</i>

02:48.318 --> 02:50.243
<i> the government's case</i>
<i> simply does not rise</i>

02:50.396 --> 02:53.063
<i> to the burden necessary</i>
<i> to take it to trial.</i>

02:53.065 --> 02:57.158
<i> Your Honor,</i>
<i> this man is a dirty cop</i>
<i> and a cold-blooded killer.</i>

02:57.178 --> 02:58.677
<i> You can't just let him walk.</i>

02:58.828 --> 02:59.569
OWEN: They let him walk.

02:59.588 --> 03:00.846
Are you kidding me?

03:01.073 --> 03:03.164
-I wish I was.
-When did this happen?

03:03.166 --> 03:05.242
OWEN:
That hearing was a month ago.

03:05.260 --> 03:07.186
They let him out
two days after that.

03:07.262 --> 03:09.688
-So he's been out for a month?
-Apparently.

03:09.839 --> 03:11.264
And nobody gave you guys
a heads-up?

03:11.341 --> 03:12.524
Well, if they dropped
the charges,

03:12.710 --> 03:14.434
they're not obligated
to tell anybody anything.

03:14.586 --> 03:15.694
Cap, you think
this might be the guy

03:15.771 --> 03:16.770
who broke into your house

03:16.922 --> 03:19.031
and staged the hoax
at the Capitol?

03:19.107 --> 03:20.607
We don't know, but...

03:20.684 --> 03:22.609
obviously it was somebody
who has a beef with me.

03:22.761 --> 03:25.037
Well, I mean,
that ain't a short list, Cap.

03:25.188 --> 03:29.433
Uh, I've been over that list,
and very few of them
are actually psychopaths.

03:29.451 --> 03:31.210
But this guy is.

03:31.286 --> 03:33.437
I want these posted
around the firehouse.

03:33.439 --> 03:36.197
If you see him, do not approach.

03:36.217 --> 03:39.200
Let me know
and I will call the authorities.

03:39.278 --> 03:41.478
-That's it?
-What do you mean?

03:41.480 --> 03:44.631
We're gonna put up fliers
like he's a lost cat?

03:44.725 --> 03:46.466
The guy's
a straight-up murderer.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.186
I watched him execute a man
like it was nothing.

03:49.879 --> 03:50.712
I am aware.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.122
But for right now,

03:52.215 --> 03:55.692
the best thing that we can do,
just be on our guard.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.485
Can you tell me where you are?

04:05.562 --> 04:07.579
WOMAN (over phone):
<i> I'm outside her house.</i>
<i> 23401 Werner.</i>

04:07.731 --> 04:09.414
<i> She won't come to the door</i>
<i> or answer her phone.</i>

04:09.566 --> 04:11.491
Okay. Is your sister
Joanne Polson?

04:11.568 --> 04:13.252
WOMAN:
<i> Yes. She-she's been sick.</i>

04:13.403 --> 04:15.754
<i> I was supposed to pick her up</i>
<i> to go to her doctor's,</i>

04:15.831 --> 04:17.147
<i> but she isn't answering.</i>

04:17.165 --> 04:18.315
<i> Her car's still here.</i>

04:18.333 --> 04:19.907
<i> This isn't like her.</i>

04:19.985 --> 04:21.409
GRACE: Okay. Help is on the way.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.336
Ms. Polson?
This is the Austin PD!

04:23.413 --> 04:24.170
Can you open up?

04:24.323 --> 04:25.005
God, this is taking too long.

04:25.081 --> 04:26.080
What if she's dead?

04:26.100 --> 04:27.841
-(siren wailing)
-(pounding on door)

04:27.993 --> 04:29.142
God!

04:32.998 --> 04:35.757
Dispatch said
your sister was ill.
Is she on any medication?

04:35.834 --> 04:37.834
She's on every medication.
She's got stomach cancer.

04:37.853 --> 04:40.170
She's in her sixth cycle
of chemotherapy.

04:40.263 --> 04:41.280
-No answer?
-No, ma'am.

04:41.431 --> 04:43.448
-It's time we get in there.
-Yes, ma'am.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.342
-Can you stand back, please?
-TOMMY: Come stand with me.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.934
CARLOS:
Alright, this is Austin Police!

04:46.954 --> 04:48.120
We're coming in.

04:50.032 --> 04:51.415
Ms. Polson?

04:52.034 --> 04:53.166
She's over here.

04:56.613 --> 04:57.546
Joanne?

04:59.875 --> 05:01.341
Stand back, ma'am.

05:05.881 --> 05:07.097
(gasps)

05:10.052 --> 05:11.885
No pulse. She's not breathing.

05:12.037 --> 05:13.553
ANGIE:
God, please, no.

05:13.705 --> 05:16.398
-TK, make sure
the gurney is ready.
-Copy.

05:21.638 --> 05:23.655
-I've got a shockable rhythm.
-What, what does that mean?

05:23.807 --> 05:26.399
It's good.
It means that there's still
electricity in her heart.

05:26.476 --> 05:29.119
Please save her.
She's my sister.

05:31.648 --> 05:32.622
Nancy?

05:34.001 --> 05:35.417
Clear!

05:38.839 --> 05:40.172
She's got a pulse.

05:40.248 --> 05:42.591
Oh, thank God she's alive.

05:44.994 --> 05:46.236
What's happening?

05:46.238 --> 05:47.737
TOMMY:
You had a close call, ma'am,

05:47.848 --> 05:50.682
but we'll have 'em
take a better look at you
at the hospital.

05:50.759 --> 05:52.351
Like hell you are.

05:53.261 --> 05:55.078
What...

05:55.097 --> 05:57.247
What are you...
(exhales)

05:57.265 --> 05:59.024
What are you people
doing in my house?

06:00.085 --> 06:01.676
I-I called them.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.195
(sighs)

06:03.271 --> 06:04.754
We talked about this.

06:04.756 --> 06:06.756
Be careful.

06:06.758 --> 06:08.758
No. Don't touch me.

06:08.777 --> 06:11.853
Ma'am, I'm not sure
you understand what's happening.

06:11.930 --> 06:13.855
Nancy just saved your life.

06:13.932 --> 06:17.042
No. You don't get it.

06:19.362 --> 06:21.546
She was supposed to let me die.

06:22.941 --> 06:24.716
TK: Hey, what's goin' on?

06:26.795 --> 06:27.944
Uh, she has a DNR.

06:27.963 --> 06:29.221
TK: Do not resuscitate?

06:29.297 --> 06:30.947
We know what it means.

06:30.966 --> 06:32.966
JOANNE: Oh, do you?

06:33.042 --> 06:34.893
Everybody just
get out of my house.

06:34.970 --> 06:37.354
(tense music playing)

06:45.297 --> 06:47.072
Okay, I have some celery.

06:48.467 --> 06:50.558
Marjan, what are we doing here?

06:50.577 --> 06:51.559
MARJAN: What do you mean?

06:51.820 --> 06:53.820
We're getting supplies
for the hang tonight

06:53.897 --> 06:55.247
at Carlos and TK's, right?

06:55.249 --> 06:58.375
Yeah. So why are we
on the other side of town?

07:02.423 --> 07:06.149
Oh, no. No-no way. No way!

07:06.151 --> 07:08.818
Just look at him.
Breathing free air.

07:08.837 --> 07:09.911
It's disgusting.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.913
How'd you even find him?

07:11.932 --> 07:14.157
Paid 50 bucks
for an online background check,

07:14.159 --> 07:16.417
got his address
and then followed him here.

07:16.495 --> 07:18.437
Can you believe
this son of a bitch

07:18.588 --> 07:20.497
has the nerve
to put on a uniform again?

07:20.515 --> 07:22.182
Those are some dickies
and a name tag.

07:22.334 --> 07:23.667
I'd hardly call that a uniform.

07:23.669 --> 07:24.668
Ma'am? Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

07:24.928 --> 07:27.112
Hey. Hey. No, no.
I got this for you. Please.

07:27.189 --> 07:28.188
-(Marjan gasps)
-Please.

07:28.264 --> 07:29.448
-Oh, did you see that?
-PAUL: What?

07:29.616 --> 07:31.766
He's helping some little
old lady with her groceries.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.661
Uh-uh. Monsters don't get
to help little old ladies.

07:34.696 --> 07:36.329
Not on my watch.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.708
Hey, Mar... Marjan, no. Hold on.

07:40.627 --> 07:41.609
Marjan, no.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.203

-Thank you!

07:43.355 --> 07:45.112
-You got a puppy, huh?
-I really appreciate it.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.524
(softly): Marjan!

07:47.542 --> 07:49.116
Drive safe, okay?

07:49.194 --> 07:50.635
MARJAN: Murderer.

07:51.788 --> 07:53.546
Marjan, what are you doing?

07:53.699 --> 07:55.640
Where are you going?

07:55.717 --> 07:57.884
Marjan, what are you doing?

07:58.036 --> 07:59.811

09:24.639 --> 09:25.789
I'm Nancy.

09:25.791 --> 09:27.399
You've been served.

09:31.479 --> 09:32.737
What is that?

09:35.483 --> 09:37.725
NANCY:
You know that lady
we saved with the DNR?

09:37.803 --> 09:38.985
TK: Hmm.

09:39.062 --> 09:40.453
She's suing me.

09:42.899 --> 09:45.041
When I used the words...

09:45.902 --> 09:46.976
"stay away,"

09:46.995 --> 09:48.645
how does that get translated

09:48.663 --> 09:52.165
into harass this man
at his place of work?

09:52.317 --> 09:54.167
(sighs) He reported me?

09:54.243 --> 09:55.409
No, he didn't.

09:55.487 --> 09:58.655
Oh. Then someone
at the market complained?

09:58.657 --> 10:00.506
No.

10:00.659 --> 10:03.101
-You snitched?
-No, I didn't snitch.

10:03.252 --> 10:05.437
Paul did not snitch,
although he should have.

10:05.588 --> 10:07.105
Okay, so who did?

10:07.256 --> 10:09.182
There were
two undercover Rangers

10:09.334 --> 10:10.183
in the parking lot.

10:10.335 --> 10:11.425
They were watching the place.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.945
Major Reyes
put a surveillance team there

10:14.097 --> 10:15.262
at my request.

10:15.340 --> 10:16.615
So the Texas Rangers snitched.

10:16.766 --> 10:18.675
I think you're focusing
on the wrong thing.

10:18.693 --> 10:20.176
Well, I didn't blow their cover.

10:20.178 --> 10:21.861
They can still do their job,
can't they?

10:22.013 --> 10:24.013
Not at work. He got fired.

10:24.032 --> 10:26.666
(laughing)
He lost his job?

10:28.611 --> 10:30.111
Sorry.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.445
OWEN:
I understand your frustration.

10:31.523 --> 10:32.797
I feel it, too.

10:32.874 --> 10:36.209
But we need to let
law enforcement handle this.

10:36.361 --> 10:38.970
They couldn't keep him
locked up for murder.

10:39.122 --> 10:40.287
You really think
anyone's gonna care

10:40.365 --> 10:41.698
that he left a pig's head
in your bed

10:41.700 --> 10:43.867
or doused your girlfriend
in baking soda?

10:43.869 --> 10:45.459
Cornstarch.

10:45.537 --> 10:47.203
And we don't know if
he did any of those things,

10:47.222 --> 10:50.206
but we do know he's dangerous,

10:50.225 --> 10:51.650
and he's out there.

10:51.877 --> 10:55.895
I mean, we don't even know
if he was thinking about us.

10:56.047 --> 10:58.156
-(sighs) And now he is.
-Exactly.

10:58.233 --> 10:59.824
We need to warn Sadie.

10:59.976 --> 11:01.025
Who's Sadie?

11:01.178 --> 11:03.069
Seriously, Cap?

11:03.146 --> 11:04.496
Oh, come on,
you're the worst. Sadie?

11:04.572 --> 11:07.073
Snowmageddon,
cabin next door to yours Sadie?

11:07.225 --> 11:08.983
Oh, yes, Sadie. Sadie.
Ham radio Sadie.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.245
Yeah, we weren't the only
ones he tried to murder.
She was there, too.

11:12.397 --> 11:13.897
She's in the Hill Country.
She'll be fine.

11:13.899 --> 11:16.566
She's not in the Hill Country.
She's here in town.

11:16.584 --> 11:18.176
How do you know that?

11:18.253 --> 11:21.054
Because she sent us invitations
to her art show?

11:21.998 --> 11:23.014
Oh.

11:23.166 --> 11:24.498
SADIE:
I wish I could say I had

11:24.576 --> 11:27.427
some sort of grand vision
for this one, but...

11:27.579 --> 11:29.979
it just sorta
poured out of me.

11:30.916 --> 11:32.357
Sadie?

11:34.769 --> 11:36.436
Owen?

11:36.588 --> 11:39.030
Well, I almost didn't
recognize you without the beard.

11:39.182 --> 11:43.017
-Oh, yeah.
-Uh, would you give me
one second, please?

11:43.094 --> 11:45.036
And you brought Marwani.

11:45.113 --> 11:47.188
-Hi, Marjan.
-Hi. Hey.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.332
So good to see you both.

11:50.693 --> 11:51.935
Oh!

11:51.953 --> 11:54.771
Come on, let me show you around.

11:54.773 --> 11:58.107
Can you believe they gave me
my own studio in the back,

11:58.126 --> 11:59.459
which I've been sleeping in,

11:59.611 --> 12:01.386
so please do not tell
the fire marshal.

12:01.463 --> 12:03.722
Oh, well, my lips are sealed.

12:03.873 --> 12:06.665
Uh, well, this is...
this is amazing.

12:06.743 --> 12:08.468
And-and you look fantastic.

12:08.544 --> 12:12.564
Um, but, uh, we didn't come here
because of the opening.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.142
What's going on?

12:16.294 --> 12:19.720
Well, you remember
Deputy Griffin
from the Hill Country?

12:19.814 --> 12:21.798
Well, yeah, it's pretty hard
to forget a guy

12:21.800 --> 12:22.949
with a pocketful of zip ties

12:23.059 --> 12:25.392
who threatens to murder you
execution-style.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.245
-Yeah.
-Is this about the trial?

12:27.322 --> 12:29.230
'Cause I've heard nothing.

12:29.307 --> 12:32.308
That's because there wasn't one.
He got out.

12:32.310 --> 12:33.476
-He escaped?
-Yeah.

12:33.495 --> 12:35.812
With the help
of the criminal justice system.

12:35.814 --> 12:37.146
They let him go.

12:37.165 --> 12:38.481
Uh, you guys
are freaking me out.

12:38.483 --> 12:39.740
OWEN: Well, don't freak out.

12:39.818 --> 12:41.926
Just, you know,
be aware of your surroundings.

12:42.078 --> 12:43.169
You know, be calm.

12:43.321 --> 12:46.155
But if you see him,
you call the police.

12:46.157 --> 12:47.599
SADIE: Okay.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.342
What are you doing?

12:49.494 --> 12:51.686
Well, I'm calling the police.

12:52.847 --> 12:55.164
(laughs) This is...
This is too good.

12:55.166 --> 12:56.257
Did you see this?

12:56.276 --> 12:57.667
"In, in the negative space

12:57.685 --> 13:02.113
that I find my meaning,
my, my purpose." (laughs)

13:02.265 --> 13:04.674
Now, now, wh-what do y'all think
is more pretentious?

13:04.692 --> 13:08.661
That statement or this art?

13:09.272 --> 13:10.580
Hey.

13:11.607 --> 13:13.041
You should leave.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.276
Really?

13:15.295 --> 13:18.688
'Cause I got no place else
I need to be right now.

13:18.690 --> 13:22.133
Do you really think
this is a smart play?

13:22.285 --> 13:24.861
Are you gonna do
somethin' about it?

13:24.879 --> 13:25.970
This is a private event.

13:26.197 --> 13:28.581
It's uncomfortable, isn't it?

13:28.733 --> 13:32.051
When someone shows up
at your place of business
and makes a stink?

13:32.128 --> 13:35.296
That's a lesson that
you failed to teach your
plucky little friend here.

13:35.373 --> 13:37.398
Did he just call me plucky?

13:39.894 --> 13:41.060
You're trespassing.

13:41.212 --> 13:42.320
So you need to go

13:42.471 --> 13:44.572
before you're taken
out of here in handcuffs.

13:45.826 --> 13:48.159
I know how to deal
with handcuffs.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.644
And we both know
that I've beaten

13:50.664 --> 13:52.313
bigger charges than trespassing.

13:52.407 --> 13:54.148
Cap, please let me deck him.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.482
Nobody's decking anybody.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.986
You know, you're lucky
that there was a blizzard,

13:59.064 --> 14:00.463
little girl.

14:02.417 --> 14:04.133
Otherwise, you would have
ended up in a ditch.

14:05.737 --> 14:07.637
-(grunts)
-(crowd gasping)

14:08.497 --> 14:10.682
(Griffin laughs)

14:14.579 --> 14:16.579
OFFICER:
Alright. Hands behind your back.

14:16.598 --> 14:19.190
(handcuffs clicking)

14:19.342 --> 14:22.068
Who's going out
in cuffs now, Captain?

14:29.260 --> 14:31.035
Okay, before you say anything,

14:31.228 --> 14:33.204
I know, I punched someone else.

14:33.431 --> 14:35.464
You just had to add
another name to the list.

14:35.466 --> 14:37.617
Well, technically,
he was already on the list.

14:37.693 --> 14:40.044
GABRIEL: Well, I guess
at some point, you were
bound to repeat yourself.

14:40.271 --> 14:42.255
Only so many people in Texas.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.624
He threatened Marjan, okay?

14:44.943 --> 14:47.368
He flat-out told her
that he would have killed her
in the blizzard

14:47.387 --> 14:49.370
if he had the opportunity,
and he meant it.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.964
-He was goading you.
-Yes, I am aware.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.132
And it worked.

14:53.209 --> 14:54.300
I've been ordered from on high

14:54.377 --> 14:56.969
to pull the surveillance detail
off Griffin.

14:57.046 --> 14:58.137
From on high because of me?

14:58.289 --> 15:00.231
Yeah. Is that not enough?

15:01.384 --> 15:03.384
It's kinda hard to argue
for the man-hours

15:03.403 --> 15:06.979
when my bosses know exactly
only two things from our tail.

15:07.056 --> 15:09.056
That your firefighter
harassed him

15:09.134 --> 15:10.074
and then you assaulted him.

15:10.226 --> 15:11.558
Yeah, I guess
that's not a good look.

15:11.727 --> 15:14.561
There's more.
Griffin's lawyer
petitioned the courts

15:14.581 --> 15:16.806
for an emergency
protective order against you.

15:16.808 --> 15:19.825
Your stalker doesn't want you
within 100 yards of him.

15:19.902 --> 15:22.569
Now, that's not a good look.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.997
I'll have you outta here
in the next few minutes,

15:25.150 --> 15:26.999
but, Owen, from here on out,

15:27.093 --> 15:30.094
you'd be wise
to keep it in check.

15:33.341 --> 15:34.265
(door opens)

15:34.417 --> 15:36.175
So I've reviewed
all the paperwork

15:36.327 --> 15:37.936
the plaintiff has filed
with the court.

15:38.012 --> 15:39.662
How bad are we talking?

15:39.681 --> 15:42.331
(sighs) Joanne Polson
is suing the city,

15:42.350 --> 15:46.486
the fire department,
and you, for one dollar each.

15:47.763 --> 15:48.838
One dollar?

15:48.856 --> 15:50.615
So she's just
trying to make a point.

15:50.692 --> 15:53.176
RON: She's definitely
trying to make a point.

15:53.178 --> 15:56.621
The only non-negotiable
condition in the suit

15:56.698 --> 15:59.624
is that they want
Ms. Gillian fired immediately...

15:59.701 --> 16:02.794
-Oh.
-...with a promise
never to rehire her.

16:03.446 --> 16:04.611
That's ridiculous.

16:04.872 --> 16:08.191
You can't tell me a jury
is going to ban Nancy for life

16:08.193 --> 16:10.209
for saving a life.

16:10.361 --> 16:12.303
We believe we have a path
to victory here.

16:12.455 --> 16:14.547
You do? How?

16:14.623 --> 16:17.809
For starters,
there's Polson's sister Angie.

16:17.960 --> 16:22.129
She never mentioned the DNR
to you on the 911 call, did she?

16:22.207 --> 16:23.539
No. No, never.

16:23.632 --> 16:26.484
What I understand, Ms. Polson
was wearing long sleeves

16:26.561 --> 16:28.561
that covered her bracelet,
is that correct?

16:28.713 --> 16:30.379
Right. Yeah. I never saw it.

16:30.398 --> 16:32.490
The law says
that a first responder

16:32.567 --> 16:35.493
must make a reasonable effort
to look for a DNR.

16:35.570 --> 16:39.330
From where I'm sitting,
that box was clearly checked.

16:39.407 --> 16:41.574
You're not psychic.
You can't be held responsible

16:41.726 --> 16:43.484
for something you never saw.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.461
You hear that, Nancy?
Everything's gonna be okay.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.339
Yeah.

16:49.584 --> 16:51.676
Appreciate you guys
bringing all this stuff over.

16:51.753 --> 16:53.069
Yeah, no worries.

16:53.162 --> 16:55.179
We figured we could all use
some comfort tonight.

16:55.331 --> 16:56.405
-Yeah.
-OWEN: I can't believe

16:56.407 --> 16:58.090
I let him goad me into that.

16:58.167 --> 17:00.334
MARJAN: Yeah, well,
it's not your fault.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.927
The guy said that
his biggest regret

17:02.080 --> 17:03.262
after everything he's done

17:03.414 --> 17:05.414
is not throwing my body
in a ditch.

17:05.433 --> 17:07.750
So my biggest regret is not
hitting him before you did.

17:07.752 --> 17:09.268
She's right. You were
protecting your family.

17:09.420 --> 17:11.195
MARJAN:
God, I just, I just hate

17:11.347 --> 17:13.180
that that hillbilly deputy
put us in check.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.682
I get put in check
at the Capitol every day.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.444
Every time some state senator
cuts a backroom deal

17:18.596 --> 17:20.096
or a lobbyist
makes a power play,

17:20.114 --> 17:22.189
but there's always some angle

17:22.208 --> 17:23.750
to play to spin out of it.

17:24.786 --> 17:27.045
You... beautiful genius.

17:27.196 --> 17:28.379
That's it.
The angle at the Capitol.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.289
Excuse me.
What, what just happened?

17:30.441 --> 17:33.125
Okay, so he was able
to waltz away from a murder

17:33.278 --> 17:35.053
that he committed
in the middle of nowhere,

17:35.129 --> 17:36.779
but a terrorism charge
at the Capitol,

17:36.798 --> 17:38.798
that he won't be able
to dance away from.

17:38.892 --> 17:42.451
Do you think we can get access
to the security footage
from the day of the attack?

17:42.470 --> 17:45.063
I have the parking space
next to the governor's,
of course, I can,

17:45.214 --> 17:47.306
but the FBI
already combed through it.

17:47.458 --> 17:50.234
But they didn't know
what they were looking for.
And we do.

17:50.386 --> 17:53.479
(sighs) Okay, but there's
dozens of hours of footage.

17:53.631 --> 17:55.131
TK: Well, luckily
we know someone

17:55.133 --> 17:56.240
who's just become an expert

17:56.392 --> 17:58.467
at scanning hours of footage.

17:58.469 --> 18:00.745
This is why I keep getting
chronic eyestrain.

18:00.896 --> 18:02.154
But you're helping me.

18:02.307 --> 18:03.915
Great. Okay, but we
need to do this

18:04.066 --> 18:05.583
before he hurts anyone else.

18:18.005 --> 18:19.597
(siren wailing)

18:22.102 --> 18:25.177
FIREFIGHTER (yells): Up top!
Give me a little
more to the right!

18:25.254 --> 18:26.679
ANDREWS:
Strand, welcome to the fight.

18:26.755 --> 18:29.332
The whole place went up
like a damn tinder box.

18:29.350 --> 18:31.442
My guys saw drums of acetone
stored inside.

18:31.594 --> 18:33.111
That's probably
where it started.

18:33.187 --> 18:34.261
You evacuated the building?

18:34.355 --> 18:35.947
No, the owner said
nobody was inside.

18:36.098 --> 18:37.506
The gallery's closed.

18:37.525 --> 18:38.858
-See if you can
get her on the phone.
-Yeah.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.301
There's a studio space
in the back.

18:40.361 --> 18:42.269
A woman's been living in it.
Have you checked there?

18:42.347 --> 18:43.621
We didn't make it that far back.

18:43.698 --> 18:47.959
That roof's about ready
to go any time now.

18:48.186 --> 18:50.044
It just keeps going
straight to voice mail.

18:53.949 --> 18:56.968
Alright, Judd, you're in command
of the 126 till I'll get back.

18:57.119 --> 18:58.527
-Where are you going?
-Going in.

18:58.529 --> 19:00.212
Wait, hey,
Captain Andrews just said

19:00.365 --> 19:02.623
that whole structure's
about to fall.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.717
That's why I don't have
time to argue with you.

19:04.869 --> 19:07.019
(flames roaring)

19:08.297 --> 19:09.522
Sadie?

19:17.732 --> 19:19.031
Sadie!

19:31.746 --> 19:32.837
Sadie?

19:33.064 --> 19:35.131
Sadie? Can you hear me?

19:38.994 --> 19:40.403
Captain Strand, 122 says

19:40.405 --> 19:42.738
that the delta roof
is coming down any second now.

19:42.757 --> 19:44.089
<i> Do you copy?</i>

19:44.242 --> 19:46.350
-No, that's it, man.
I'm going in.
-Yeah, me too.

19:46.427 --> 19:48.577
Oh, hey.
The hell y'all ain't.

19:48.579 --> 19:50.354
You were right there when
the captain gave me the order.

19:50.506 --> 19:52.690
Yeah, because he always
has to play Lone Ranger.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.570
Yeah. And 'cause he knows
what he's doing.

19:59.424 --> 20:02.575
(dramatic music playing)

20:16.198 --> 20:17.957
Owen, you came for me.

20:18.033 --> 20:20.276
(siren wailing)

20:20.294 --> 20:23.137
♪

20:31.138 --> 20:32.688
Nancy, you alright?

20:37.070 --> 20:38.527
Yeah, totally.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.297
Are you sure?

20:41.390 --> 20:44.533
'Cause I've been watching you
unlace that boot for a while.

20:51.659 --> 20:52.625
Hey.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.647
You heard the city attorney.
You didn't see the bracelet.

20:58.666 --> 21:02.134
There's no jury in the world
that's gonna blame you for this.

21:06.340 --> 21:07.823
But I did.

21:07.842 --> 21:09.249
What?

21:09.327 --> 21:11.435
I did see the DNR bracelet.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.064
It slid out
from under her sleeve.

21:15.924 --> 21:16.999
I saved her anyway.

21:17.001 --> 21:19.277
No, Nancy,
what were you thinking?

21:19.428 --> 21:22.280
Come on, we train for this.

21:22.431 --> 21:25.599
Watching that lady
bawl her eyes out

21:25.618 --> 21:29.436
because she thought she was
gonna lose her big sister,

21:29.455 --> 21:35.275
I thought of my sister
and I couldn't help but help.

21:35.295 --> 21:38.111
-Okay, this isn't good.
-I know, Cap.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.523
And that's why
I'm going to resign

21:40.525 --> 21:44.543
and spare everyone the misery
of going to court.

21:44.620 --> 21:47.305
She wants my scalp, Cap,
and I'm gonna give it to her.

21:47.456 --> 21:49.456
No, ma'am.
No, you are not. No.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.642
NANCY: Yes, I am.

21:51.677 --> 21:55.479
Because it's either that
or lie under oath.

21:55.706 --> 21:58.316
And that's just not me.

22:00.302 --> 22:02.236
Well, maybe there is
another way to fix this.

22:03.230 --> 22:05.114
And we won't
have to go to trial.

22:08.477 --> 22:10.703
(monitor beeps)

22:14.834 --> 22:16.559
How's she doing?

22:16.577 --> 22:19.337
She's pretty shaken up.
But she's lucky.

22:19.413 --> 22:21.246
Some smoke inhalation
and a sprained wrist.

22:21.323 --> 22:22.731
Other than that,
she should be fine.

22:22.750 --> 22:26.068
Please tell me that
she saw him start the fire.

22:26.087 --> 22:27.736
-Griffin.
-No.

22:27.738 --> 22:29.905
She was painting
in the back with headphones on.

22:29.907 --> 22:31.924
Last thing she remembers
is smelling smoke

22:32.000 --> 22:33.576
and then waking up in your arms.

22:33.594 --> 22:35.669
Well, the gallery
has security cameras,
have you looked at 'em?

22:35.688 --> 22:37.413
They were slagged in the fire.

22:37.431 --> 22:39.673
This guy has got
a horseshoe up his ass.

22:39.692 --> 22:40.691
(laughing) We'll see.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.510
We should be able to
pull the footage from the cloud.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.939
Alright, well, you need to put
24/7 surveillance on Griffin.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.399
Owen, I told you I can't.

22:48.551 --> 22:51.017
Until we have hard evidence,
nothing's changed.

22:51.095 --> 22:52.352
So you're telling me
we need to wait

22:52.430 --> 22:54.113
until he actually kills someone?

22:54.189 --> 22:56.707
-I'm sorry. Someone else.
-No.

22:56.859 --> 23:01.879
What I'm saying is I can't
put a detail on Griffin's house

23:02.030 --> 23:05.549
at 647 Salem Bluff Drive.

23:05.776 --> 23:08.277
It's the one with
the white front porch.

23:08.279 --> 23:10.388
♪

23:19.123 --> 23:20.289
How you holdin' up?

23:20.291 --> 23:22.733
I'll be doing better
once I get outta here.

23:22.810 --> 23:25.069
Where do you plan on going
after they discharge you?

23:25.220 --> 23:28.480
I'm heading for the hills,
literally.

23:28.633 --> 23:30.390
Your cabin? No. No, no.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.058
You won't be safe there.
You'll be a sitting duck.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.244
But that Texas Ranger said

23:33.320 --> 23:34.486
they couldn't give me
police protection.

23:34.563 --> 23:36.747
So what else
am I supposed to do?

23:40.161 --> 23:41.252
Hey, guys, come on in.

23:41.403 --> 23:44.070
Hey, Sadie, this is Carlos,

23:44.090 --> 23:46.465
who's the officer
I was telling you about.

23:47.409 --> 23:49.242
Alright,
your pain meds are here.

23:49.320 --> 23:50.761
How's your wrist feeling?

23:50.913 --> 23:52.488
No, it's okay right now.

23:52.506 --> 23:54.432
Okay, well, if it acts up,
TK can look at it.

23:54.583 --> 23:56.600
-He's a paramedic. Where's TK?
-Oh, after you called,

23:56.752 --> 23:58.844
he decided we weren't ready
for all this hosting,

23:58.921 --> 24:00.329
so he's out grabbing dinner.

24:00.347 --> 24:02.440
I hope I'm not putting you out.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.517
Never thought
I would need police detail.

24:05.594 --> 24:08.094
Seems like it comes
with the territory.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.521
You can't get
next to Owen Strand

24:09.598 --> 24:11.449
without somebody
wanting you dead.

24:11.525 --> 24:13.117
Sadie, this is
my girlfriend Catherine,

24:13.268 --> 24:15.953
and I urge you to ignore
everything she says.

24:16.030 --> 24:18.514
Okay. Alright.
Uh, I'll be on my cell.

24:18.516 --> 24:20.458
-Where are you going?
-Well, it's my fault

24:20.685 --> 24:23.127
that the Rangers and the APD
can't sit on him,

24:23.129 --> 24:24.110
so I'm gonna do it.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.521
Does my father know?

24:25.539 --> 24:27.206
He kinda suggested it.

24:27.358 --> 24:28.373
I'm going with you.

24:28.468 --> 24:31.135
-Catherine.
-CATHERINE: I'm going.

24:31.212 --> 24:32.452
You don't plan
to confront him, do you?

24:32.472 --> 24:34.213
-OWEN: No, just watch him.
-CATHERINE: Great.

24:34.307 --> 24:36.765
And while you watch him,
I'll watch you.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.293
Here we go.

24:40.313 --> 24:44.297
Fresh pecan sandies,
still warm from the oven.

24:44.317 --> 24:46.132
-My husband's recipe.
-ANGIE: Thank you.

24:46.210 --> 24:48.227
It was one of his favorites.

24:48.303 --> 24:49.987
None for me, thank you.

24:50.064 --> 24:51.805
"Was" one of his favorites?

24:51.824 --> 24:53.215
Um, yes.

24:53.234 --> 24:56.902
Charles has been gone now
for just over a year.

24:57.054 --> 24:59.221
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

24:59.223 --> 25:00.981
-My condolences.
-Thank you.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.242
Well, you've done him proud.
They're delicious.

25:03.394 --> 25:05.077
TOMMY: I appreciate that.

25:05.153 --> 25:07.579
Um, listen, I...

25:07.732 --> 25:11.083
I realize this is, um,
a very unusual request.

25:11.235 --> 25:13.177
I just want to thank you
for agreeing

25:13.254 --> 25:16.238
to come and sit down with us.

25:16.257 --> 25:18.999
Well, my sister wouldn't
stop whining about it

25:19.076 --> 25:21.426
until I agreed to, so...

25:21.579 --> 25:26.172
Listen, Captain Vega, let me
just save you the trouble.

25:26.250 --> 25:28.567
I'm not dropping my lawsuit.

25:29.436 --> 25:30.753
Don't be rude, Jo.

25:30.771 --> 25:32.104
They just wanna talk.

25:32.240 --> 25:35.849
Well, this was supposed
to do all the talking for me.

25:35.943 --> 25:37.201
Ms. Polson...

25:38.429 --> 25:42.264
I know I should have
respected your wishes.

25:42.266 --> 25:45.025
But all I've ever wanted to do
since I was a kid

25:45.102 --> 25:46.752
was save people.

25:48.606 --> 25:50.622
Please don't take that
away from me.

25:50.775 --> 25:53.050
You still don't get it, do you?

25:53.944 --> 25:55.594
This isn't about you, dear.

25:58.465 --> 26:00.599
Um, Mrs. Polson...

26:02.562 --> 26:07.547
I know that people
with your prognosis

26:07.625 --> 26:10.734
start to think about
what their legacy might be.

26:12.146 --> 26:14.463
I'm begging you,

26:14.465 --> 26:18.409
please don't have your legacy
be ending hers.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.747
You offered me one of
your husband's cookies.

26:25.326 --> 26:27.626
I didn't say no
'cause I didn't want one.

26:28.996 --> 26:31.071
I said no...

26:31.090 --> 26:32.648
because if I ate it,

26:32.666 --> 26:35.509
I'd be throwing up
for the next six hours.

26:36.503 --> 26:38.745
You ask about my legacy?

26:38.764 --> 26:41.098
I want my legacy
to be speaking up

26:41.325 --> 26:43.350
for people who are suffering...

26:44.495 --> 26:47.396
for voices
who nobody wants to hear.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.661
(whimsical music playing)

27:06.183 --> 27:07.708
(sharp knock on window)

27:09.353 --> 27:11.036
What do you think you're doing?

27:11.188 --> 27:12.354
Same thing as you, I'm guessing.

27:12.447 --> 27:13.947
Making sure
that murderous bastard

27:14.024 --> 27:15.023
doesn't try anything else.

27:15.042 --> 27:16.041
What did I tell you?

27:16.193 --> 27:17.693
Not to bother him at work.

27:17.695 --> 27:18.877
-You're leaving.
-Why?

27:19.213 --> 27:22.306
Because the murderous bastard
has threatened to kill you.

27:22.457 --> 27:23.882
And because your
situational awareness

27:24.034 --> 27:25.367
leaves something
to be desired.

27:25.369 --> 27:27.961
First of all,
my situational awareness
is just fine.

27:28.038 --> 27:29.647
-I totally knew you were there.
-Lie.

27:29.874 --> 27:32.483
And I'm not the one he has
a restraining order against.

27:32.559 --> 27:33.984
I'll take my chances.

27:34.061 --> 27:35.319
Go on, scram.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.229
Go back and scrub
that security video.

27:37.381 --> 27:38.530
Fine.

27:40.142 --> 27:43.619
But you two have
a screwed-up notion
of a date night.

27:47.649 --> 27:49.574
-SADIE:
Is this the main hall camera?
-(door opening)

27:49.727 --> 27:53.486
Hey. Sorry it took so long.
The line was out the door.

27:53.580 --> 27:55.155
TK, this is Sadie.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.416
Oh, yeah, of course. Hi.

27:57.568 --> 27:59.510
I hope you like pho
because if you're hungry

27:59.586 --> 28:01.512
and you don't like pho
you're sort of outta luck.

28:01.588 --> 28:03.764
You know,
let me help you with that.

28:05.426 --> 28:06.350
Where's Dad?

28:06.686 --> 28:08.577
He decided he needed
to keep an eye on Griffin.

28:08.579 --> 28:11.188
He's sitting outside
the guy's house with Catherine.

28:11.265 --> 28:14.750
He's stalking his stalker,
and he brought a date?

28:14.768 --> 28:18.845
Well, I mean, to be fair,
she was pretty insistent.

28:18.864 --> 28:22.199
Yeah, well, at least our
fire insurance is up to date,

28:22.276 --> 28:24.142
'cause the last time
he pissed off a maniac,

28:24.144 --> 28:26.036
our whole place burned down
to the ground.

28:30.784 --> 28:33.877
I'm starting to regret
that we didn't pick up coffees.

28:33.954 --> 28:35.695
Oh, no, you're not, believe me.

28:35.697 --> 28:37.381
Had you picked up coffee,
three hours later,

28:37.532 --> 28:39.082
you'd be looking
for the nearest bush.

28:39.159 --> 28:41.276
That is the single easiest way

28:41.278 --> 28:43.369
to get your cover blown
on a stakeout.

28:43.389 --> 28:46.223
I didn't realize firefighters
knew so much about stakeouts.

28:46.374 --> 28:47.966
Oh, we don't. I've just seen
the movie "Stakeout"

28:48.060 --> 28:49.393
like a thousand times.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.044
"Stakeout" with Rosie O'Donnell?

28:51.063 --> 28:52.454
Bite your tongue! "Stakeout."

28:52.456 --> 28:54.806
With Emilio Estevez
and Madeleine Stowe.

28:54.883 --> 28:56.233
Oh, right. Oh.

28:56.310 --> 28:58.293
-Love Madeleine Stowe.
-Oh, yeah.

28:58.295 --> 29:00.070
I remember
"The Last of the Mohicans."

29:00.147 --> 29:01.721
-Hmm.
-(door opens)

29:01.815 --> 29:03.073
(sighs)

29:03.225 --> 29:04.891
What are we lookin' at?

29:04.910 --> 29:08.662
I wouldn't think about
making a move
right this second, Captain.

29:10.750 --> 29:13.709
Just stay still.

29:15.145 --> 29:17.087
(Griffin laughs)

29:17.164 --> 29:18.756
Say cheese.

29:18.832 --> 29:19.998
(camera shutter clicks)

29:20.150 --> 29:23.485
And these go straight to APD.

29:23.504 --> 29:26.597
You're in violation
of your restraining order.

29:27.992 --> 29:29.415
You know what?

29:29.493 --> 29:32.177
This calls for a celebration.

29:32.329 --> 29:34.730
I think I'm gonna
go get me some tacos.

29:40.187 --> 29:41.686
-You okay?
-(exhales)

29:41.839 --> 29:46.408
I guess I should be glad
it was a phone and not a gun.

29:47.602 --> 29:49.119
Please do me a favor.

29:49.271 --> 29:51.771
Don't mention
any of this to Marjan.

29:51.849 --> 29:53.015
(loud explosion)

29:53.033 --> 29:55.584
-Oh, my God!
-(Griffin screaming)

29:57.871 --> 29:59.546
(screaming continues)

30:07.698 --> 30:09.047
Ooh. Wait. Take it back.

30:09.199 --> 30:10.382
Is that him?

30:10.534 --> 30:12.142
CARLOS: Uh...

30:12.294 --> 30:14.102
Pretty sure that's a statue.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.818
(coughs) Hot.

30:20.969 --> 30:22.227
Mm.

30:22.304 --> 30:23.987
Oh, no, did I screw it up?
I'm sorry.

30:24.139 --> 30:27.382
I have a tendency
to get a little wild
with the chili oil.

30:27.401 --> 30:29.993
No, no, I'm just sweating
through my hoodie.

30:30.145 --> 30:31.995
I might have to shed
a few layers or...

30:32.147 --> 30:34.147
crack a window open.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.391
(clears throat)
How-how's yours?

30:36.410 --> 30:37.909
Oh, mine's good,
you lightweight.

30:38.062 --> 30:40.587
Shut up.
Excuse me.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.516
I feel like we're chasing
our own tails here.

30:54.336 --> 30:56.244
SADIE: Would you like me
to get you some more tea?

30:56.263 --> 30:58.063
CARLOS:
Actually, that would be...

30:58.691 --> 31:00.098
(key clacks)

31:00.250 --> 31:01.608
Is that a yes?

31:09.109 --> 31:10.993
Sadie, why don't you sit down?

31:16.950 --> 31:18.417
(sighs)

31:19.027 --> 31:20.460
(key clacks)

31:22.548 --> 31:24.548
(sighs) What did you find?

31:31.539 --> 31:32.723
CARLOS: You were there.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.601
Yeah.

31:37.287 --> 31:40.063
And the card Catherine opened...

31:41.475 --> 31:43.291
is it in the bag
you're carrying?

31:43.310 --> 31:44.568
(laughs)

31:48.132 --> 31:49.990
It was just cornstarch.

31:52.819 --> 31:54.077
Why?

31:55.897 --> 31:57.039
Hm...

32:02.087 --> 32:04.212
Do you believe in destiny?

32:05.816 --> 32:09.409
Do you believe that you and TK
are destined to be together?

32:09.428 --> 32:13.171
You know what?
I know that you do.

32:13.323 --> 32:16.324
I can tell just from
the short time I've been here.

32:16.326 --> 32:20.062
This home
you've made together...

32:21.106 --> 32:23.515
it's like you're
supposed to be here.

32:23.667 --> 32:27.093
And he's who you're
supposed to be with.

32:27.171 --> 32:30.263
And that-that other place
that was supposed to burn down,

32:30.282 --> 32:32.616
like it had to burn down.

32:33.619 --> 32:34.660
Right?

32:35.788 --> 32:38.363
That's the same
with me and Owen.

32:38.515 --> 32:42.125
We are meant to be together too.

32:42.277 --> 32:45.020
I mean, what are the odds?
What are the odds

32:45.022 --> 32:48.190
that the week
my divorce is finalized,

32:48.208 --> 32:50.192
I meet Owen
up in the Hill Country

32:50.210 --> 32:53.286
and we have
an adventure together?

32:53.363 --> 32:56.556
Because that is destiny.

33:00.962 --> 33:03.397
And how did you break
into Owen's house?

33:04.132 --> 33:05.465
Oh, well, that was easy.

33:05.542 --> 33:06.541
Hmm.

33:06.727 --> 33:10.470
He has the young girl
that walks his dog.

33:10.489 --> 33:13.306
Right? So I watched her
use the key

33:13.400 --> 33:16.410
that he keeps under the planter
on the front porch.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.221
You set the fire to the gallery.

33:19.239 --> 33:21.456
-(laughs): Well...
-Sadie.

33:22.150 --> 33:23.575
You could have died.

33:23.651 --> 33:26.336
Mm. No.

33:26.413 --> 33:29.089
No. I knew he was
gonna come for me.

33:29.842 --> 33:31.341
And he did.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.722
Where's TK?

33:38.684 --> 33:40.142
I don't know.

33:42.262 --> 33:45.022
Oh, uh, you might
wanna sit down.

33:50.011 --> 33:52.195
What did you do?

33:52.347 --> 33:54.756
Well, I mean,
I couldn't have you tell Owen

33:54.758 --> 33:58.276
before I could explain
all this to him myself.

33:58.428 --> 34:00.278
(echoing):
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh...

34:00.430 --> 34:05.149
I, I, I put 70 milligrams
of oxy in your soup.

34:05.227 --> 34:07.461
It shouldn't be enough
to kill you.

34:08.863 --> 34:10.172
I don't think.

34:12.033 --> 34:13.383
CARLOS (weakly): TK...

34:18.131 --> 34:19.598
(door buzzes)

34:21.894 --> 34:23.301
GABRIEL (over phone):
<i> Either of you hurt?</i>

34:23.453 --> 34:25.395
No, we were in the car
when it happened.

34:25.547 --> 34:27.806
GABRIEL:
<i> What about Griffin,</i>
<i> he gonna make it?</i>

34:27.958 --> 34:29.457
OWEN (over phone):
<i> If he's lucky, no.</i>

34:29.476 --> 34:31.643
You were watching the house,
you see anything?

34:31.719 --> 34:34.554
You mean did I see
someone set the bomb?

34:34.631 --> 34:36.298
GABRIEL:
<i> I'm starting to think</i>
<i> this guy's enemy list</i>

34:36.391 --> 34:37.799
is even longer than yours.

34:37.801 --> 34:39.534
-(cell phone beeps)
-Hang on.

34:41.138 --> 34:42.996
Sammy, what do you got?

34:46.476 --> 34:50.253
<i> Well, we got</i>
<i> the security footage</i>
<i> from the art gallery.</i>

34:50.405 --> 34:53.173
Griffin didn't torch it.
He's not your stalker.

34:53.834 --> 34:55.050
Do you know who is?

34:56.261 --> 34:58.411
Hey. They got you
answering their door now?

34:58.430 --> 35:01.556
Well, I'm the only one here
at the moment.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.992
What?

35:04.010 --> 35:05.343
Yeah. We think
we found something

35:05.420 --> 35:07.920
on the security video
that might be Griffin.

35:07.998 --> 35:09.088
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

35:09.166 --> 35:10.756
That's amazing. Great.

35:10.776 --> 35:13.401
Well, here I was
looking forward to eyestrain.

35:16.097 --> 35:18.857
They, they left you
here alone?

35:19.009 --> 35:22.510
Yeah, well, Carlos was gonna
take it over to his dad.

35:22.529 --> 35:24.346
You know, the Texas Ranger.

35:24.348 --> 35:27.624
Yeah? He took it over?
He hasn't heard of the Internet?

35:31.112 --> 35:33.705
And TK, he went with him?

35:33.857 --> 35:35.206
SADIE: Mm-hmm.

35:35.359 --> 35:37.425
(cell phone ringing)

35:39.379 --> 35:41.805
MARJAN:
And he left his phone here?

35:41.882 --> 35:44.057
(ominous music playing)

35:44.885 --> 35:46.685
(phone ringing)

35:48.796 --> 35:49.980
(groans)

35:50.131 --> 35:51.982
(grunts) Hell, no.

35:54.987 --> 35:56.486
Bitch.

35:56.638 --> 35:57.696
God!

35:58.640 --> 35:59.698
(winces)

36:08.983 --> 36:10.417
Owen.

36:11.186 --> 36:12.711
You came for me.

36:13.897 --> 36:15.730
I didn't come for you.

36:15.732 --> 36:16.965
But he did.

36:20.828 --> 36:23.496
Sadie Becker,
you're under arrest.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.724
(handcuffs clicking)

36:33.433 --> 36:36.359
(siren wailing)

36:42.684 --> 36:46.594
Okay, Nance, uh, how
we doing on Kerlix gauze?

36:46.613 --> 36:50.540
Uh, good on gauze, but we should
put trauma pads and IV tubing

36:50.617 --> 36:52.600
on the next supply order.

36:52.602 --> 36:53.768
TOMMY: Copy that.

36:53.861 --> 36:57.622
Which I guess
will be my last supply order.

36:57.699 --> 37:00.884
You heard the lawyer.
It could be months
before we go to trial.

37:01.035 --> 37:05.138
Which means you have
plenty of boring paperwork
in front of you.

37:06.058 --> 37:07.891
Just when I thought I was out.

37:08.042 --> 37:09.117
TOMMY: Uh-huh.

37:09.119 --> 37:10.618
(chuckles)

37:10.637 --> 37:13.638
Hey, bud. I didn't expect
to see you back so soon.

37:13.790 --> 37:15.290
I had to get out of the house.

37:15.292 --> 37:16.808
How's Carlos holding up?

37:16.884 --> 37:18.884
He'll be fine.
He's resting at home.

37:18.962 --> 37:20.237
Shouldn't you be doing the same?

37:20.313 --> 37:22.405
Trust me, Cap,
I'm much better off here.

37:22.557 --> 37:25.057
Otherwise, I'll just be
spinning out about the fact

37:25.184 --> 37:27.244
that I'm back to day one.

37:27.395 --> 37:29.663
Day one? Day one of what?

37:31.083 --> 37:32.582
My sobriety.

37:32.659 --> 37:35.335
The pills that Sadie used
were opioids.

37:38.498 --> 37:41.073
TOMMY:
Alright, then back to work.

37:41.151 --> 37:42.500
I need you to check out
the supply room.

37:42.594 --> 37:46.412
Give me a count
on nasal cannulas
and non-rebreathers.

37:46.490 --> 37:48.765
-On it, Cap.
-Alright,<i> dale.</i>

37:50.102 --> 37:51.309
ANGIE: Excuse me?

37:52.178 --> 37:54.062
I'm-I'm so sorry to bother you.

37:55.849 --> 37:57.065
I, um...

38:00.261 --> 38:02.654
Angie, what's wrong?

38:05.266 --> 38:07.450
My sister Joanne...

38:08.862 --> 38:10.328
she passed away last night.

38:11.031 --> 38:13.081
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.458
I appreciate that.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.336
But for the first time in...

38:18.371 --> 38:21.631
(sighs) two years,
her face was...

38:22.801 --> 38:24.375
peaceful.

38:24.452 --> 38:26.511
She's finally not in pain, so...

38:26.546 --> 38:30.765
Still, I know what
it's like to lose someone.

38:33.961 --> 38:35.562
Is it okay if I give you a hug?

38:36.297 --> 38:38.064
Then I'm gonna hug you.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.693
I'm so sorry for your loss.

38:42.546 --> 38:43.611
ANGIE: Thanks.

38:45.306 --> 38:48.383
But I didn't come here
for a hug.

38:48.401 --> 38:49.576
I, um...

38:51.163 --> 38:53.663
Joanne dropped the lawsuit
against you.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.325
Oh, my God. Really?

38:58.319 --> 38:59.878
ANGIE:
And she left you something.

39:01.173 --> 39:05.133
She wanted you to keep
her DNR bracelet with you.

39:05.827 --> 39:07.510
On every call.

39:07.587 --> 39:09.904
To remind you to listen.

39:09.906 --> 39:12.090
That's my sister for you.

39:12.242 --> 39:14.559
Even beyond the grave, she's...

39:15.261 --> 39:17.245
still running the show.

39:17.263 --> 39:19.171
No.

39:19.265 --> 39:23.026
No, she just knew how to
gracefully exit stage.

39:34.206 --> 39:35.521
Marjan? It's me.
Can I come in?

39:35.599 --> 39:38.190
MARJAN:
Yeah, come on in, Cap.

39:38.268 --> 39:43.046
...five, four, three, two, one.

39:43.123 --> 39:44.214
-(grunts)
-What are you doing?

39:44.407 --> 39:46.216
They gave me two units
of O negative.

39:46.292 --> 39:47.775
I'm feeling no pain.

39:47.794 --> 39:50.387
I reckon I should be good to
get back on the rig by Thursday.

39:50.538 --> 39:52.780
No, no. You were
stabbed in the back.

39:52.782 --> 39:55.783
You need a week off.
I think that that's a rule.

39:55.785 --> 39:57.018
Fine.

39:57.971 --> 40:00.230
What's that?

40:00.306 --> 40:05.026
Gabriel gave me
the Texas Rangers' file
on Sadie.

40:06.630 --> 40:08.571
You know, I think I've had
enough true crime for one week.

40:08.648 --> 40:10.573
Why don't you just
give me the highlights?

40:10.650 --> 40:13.743
Okay. You remember when
I met her in the Hill Country

40:13.970 --> 40:16.246
and she was talking about
having just left her ex-husband?

40:16.397 --> 40:18.139
Let me guess.
There was no ex-husband?

40:18.158 --> 40:19.657
Oh, there's
an ex-husband alright.

40:19.734 --> 40:22.752
Uh, they found his severed head
in her freezer.

40:22.904 --> 40:24.087
Whoa.

40:24.814 --> 40:25.738
Dark.

40:25.815 --> 40:28.407
Yep. Yep.

40:28.427 --> 40:31.669
Because I missed
all the signs

40:31.746 --> 40:32.987
and I sent you right to her.

40:33.156 --> 40:35.581
And you were in the door
not two minutes after me.

40:35.659 --> 40:37.325
And I may have
slightly distracted you

40:37.327 --> 40:38.918
by starting a war
on a second front

40:38.937 --> 40:40.419
with the good-old deputy.

40:40.497 --> 40:42.588
Well, if we're gonna
fight a war on two fronts,

40:42.666 --> 40:43.606
there's nobody
I'd rather fight it with.

40:43.683 --> 40:45.775
But how about next time
just one front?

40:45.885 --> 40:47.444
Or better yet, no fronts.

40:47.595 --> 40:49.279
Good luck with that,
Mr. Fists of Fury.

40:49.430 --> 40:51.281
(sighs) Alright,
I guess that's fair,

40:51.357 --> 40:53.524
but I swear to you,
I'm done throwing my haymakers.

40:53.677 --> 40:56.344
Oh, Cap, don't make me laugh.
I'll pop a stitch.

40:56.362 --> 40:58.663
-(knock on door)
-Captain Strand?

40:59.365 --> 41:00.457
Thank you.

41:04.521 --> 41:06.546
(monitor beeps)

41:21.888 --> 41:23.354
Deputy?

41:25.299 --> 41:28.209
(Griffin chuckles softly)

41:28.228 --> 41:31.988
Didn't think they allowed
visitors in this unit.

41:32.065 --> 41:33.323
Helps to know people.

41:34.493 --> 41:36.659
But I guess I don't
need to tell you that.

41:41.649 --> 41:45.710
You know, for the longest time,
I couldn't...

41:47.822 --> 41:49.063
figure out the mystery of it.

41:49.065 --> 41:50.507
I couldn't get my...

41:51.158 --> 41:52.759
my head around it.

41:54.738 --> 41:57.071
About what?

41:57.090 --> 41:59.098
How you skated
on that murder charge.

42:01.002 --> 42:02.727
Then I saw your car blow up.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.563
And it all snapped into focus.

42:06.525 --> 42:09.359
-GRIFFIN: Is that so?
-That so.

42:11.437 --> 42:13.988
It was your good friends
the cartel, wasn't it?

42:15.367 --> 42:18.017
Because you made a deal
with the FBI to turn on 'em.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.261
Isn't that right?

42:20.263 --> 42:22.664
Never lost a wink of sleep
about it.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.627
Can I ask you a question?

42:30.123 --> 42:31.714
Why'd you do it?

42:35.387 --> 42:38.429
Why'd you bother
to put out those flames...

42:39.558 --> 42:41.724
after everything I did?

42:43.953 --> 42:45.562
'Cause it's my job.

42:48.567 --> 42:51.693
And because you're covered
in third-degree burns.

42:53.572 --> 42:57.365
And they're going to
cause you a lifetime of pain.

42:59.578 --> 43:02.328
And that feels like
the justice you deserve.

43:05.584 --> 43:09.460
You are one dark
son of a bitch, Strand.
