01:04.416 --> 01:05.416
Yeah?

01:06.708 --> 01:09.625
Uh... uh... no.

01:09.791 --> 01:11.375
Say again?

01:12.416 --> 01:13.726
Come on... what?

01:13.750 --> 01:16.916
Jumping? Huh? Music?

01:17.083 --> 01:18.125
No, mate.

01:18.541 --> 01:20.666
Mmm. Uh...

01:20.916 --> 01:22.416
Try next door.

01:25.166 --> 01:26.791
Ta-ta.

01:35.333 --> 01:36.583
You playing music now?

01:36.666 --> 01:38.791
Yeah. Can't sleep
with the shower on.

01:49.625 --> 01:51.083
That my protein shake?

01:58.625 --> 01:59.625
Ow!

02:01.166 --> 02:03.583
Ooh. Ooh! Oi! Oi!

02:09.416 --> 02:11.791
Hey, you hear Jojo got sucked off
by a lady journalist?

02:11.916 --> 02:13.517
Yeah, she had a deadline.

02:13.541 --> 02:16.166
He made her give him shines
before he talked to her.

02:16.541 --> 02:18.416
- Who told you that?
- Jojo.

02:19.666 --> 02:21.017
You don't like Jojo?

02:21.041 --> 02:24.208
Make a lovely couple, you two.
Who makes the tea?

02:24.500 --> 02:26.041
You reckon he'll play tomorrow?

02:28.208 --> 02:30.368
- He strikes the ball clean.
- Can't control it though.

02:30.458 --> 02:31.726
Yeah, but his left foot, though.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.708
Yeah, he thinks
he's Roberto fucking Carlos.

02:33.791 --> 02:35.708
Hits the target about as much too.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.750
Well, that ain't gonna help you sleep.

02:42.208 --> 02:43.333
Doughnut.

02:43.541 --> 02:45.208
Have to clean your teeth again!

02:50.458 --> 02:52.250
I need some pussy, man.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.541
It's killing me.

02:54.416 --> 02:58.083
We could get a girl, take it
in turns, one on, one off.

02:58.958 --> 03:00.476
You know them girls
hanging in the lobby?

03:00.500 --> 03:02.333
Yeah. One of them
looked like your sister.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.500
Shut up!

03:03.583 --> 03:04.916
Oh, Kemme!

03:05.000 --> 03:07.750
Danny and Leesy slipped them
security guys some money

03:07.833 --> 03:09.291
to send them a couple of birds up.

03:09.708 --> 03:10.833
- Did they?
- Yeah.

03:10.916 --> 03:12.666
But Jojo reckons they're plants, though.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.833
What? Like asparagus?

03:14.916 --> 03:16.625
No, like special agents, man.

03:16.750 --> 03:18.267
They want their home
teams to win, so they come

03:18.291 --> 03:19.416
here and have sex with us.

03:19.958 --> 03:22.666
Right. I'm enjoying this theory.

03:22.750 --> 03:25.390
Because when you cum, that's
your energy gone. Everyone knows that.

03:25.625 --> 03:27.791
What PE syllabus did your school do?

03:28.000 --> 03:31.083
What do I need GCSEs for?
This is the Champions League, man.

03:31.583 --> 03:32.708
We made it.

03:32.875 --> 03:34.416
After tomorrow, ain't no looking back.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.375
We ain't even gonna play tomorrow.

03:36.458 --> 03:38.258
We'll just be keeping
the bench warm all game,

03:38.333 --> 03:40.208
just like last week
and the week before.

03:40.375 --> 03:43.166
Jase... you are having me on, right?

03:43.416 --> 03:47.333
We're gonna start tomorrow.
I hope you do know that.

03:47.916 --> 03:50.791
Right. We've been at this
academy since we were eight.

03:50.875 --> 03:52.166
Uh, seven.

03:52.250 --> 03:54.000
All them other kids
have fallen by the way.

03:54.083 --> 03:56.541
Now, it's just me, you and Jojo.

03:56.625 --> 03:58.750
It's that new generation,
we've been groomed.

03:59.041 --> 04:00.416
Jase, this is our time.

04:03.833 --> 04:06.208
I got something to show you.

04:07.208 --> 04:09.583
Jojo and Leesy tag-teamed
these girls in Blackburn.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.767
Nah, nah, nah. I don't wanna watch

04:10.791 --> 04:13.250
Jojo's sorry arse bobbing up and down.

04:14.250 --> 04:15.500
Fucking hell.

04:15.916 --> 04:17.309
I mean, this is it.

04:17.333 --> 04:21.125
Oi, my dick's bigger than his.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.041
This is it, this is it.
This bit kills me.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.250
Oh, no!

04:31.500 --> 04:33.333
"I don't want! No!"

04:34.625 --> 04:36.791
That is classic!

04:39.166 --> 04:40.583
Have you seen his missus?

04:40.666 --> 04:42.583
Leesy's? Yeah, man.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.208
Do you feel bad for her?

04:45.500 --> 04:49.208
No, no, no. She must have known that man's
got urges when she married him.

04:49.291 --> 04:51.791
Always dipping his willy
somewhere he shouldn't be.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.791
How comes it never gets in the papers?

04:53.875 --> 04:55.435
It's not like he even tries to hide it.

04:55.708 --> 04:56.916
He's got a deal with them.

04:57.583 --> 04:58.583
Huh?

04:58.625 --> 05:01.208
You got a story you wanna
keep out the papers,

05:01.291 --> 05:03.125
and you gotta find another story. Right?

05:03.208 --> 05:04.875
That is all, they don't actually care.

05:06.416 --> 05:07.583
Your agent not tell you this?

05:07.666 --> 05:09.500
Hmm? Oh, no.

05:10.125 --> 05:11.791
My dad handles all that.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.375
You wanna get yourself
a proper agent, mate.

05:18.291 --> 05:19.291
See that?

05:20.291 --> 05:21.333
What?

05:22.041 --> 05:23.041
That.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.750
What's that?

05:26.250 --> 05:28.916
That is my celebration.

05:30.041 --> 05:31.083
- That?
- Mmm.

05:31.625 --> 05:34.583
I'm going to trademark that.
Put it on all my merchandise.

05:34.666 --> 05:36.666
It looks like you got
a bit of dirt in your eye.

05:36.750 --> 05:39.916
Ah, ten years from now, all the little
kids are going to be doing that.

05:40.083 --> 05:42.125
Are they, Ade?

05:42.333 --> 05:43.500
Yeah, you watch.

05:47.250 --> 05:48.250
What?

05:48.291 --> 05:49.958
Cor, you black boys.

05:50.041 --> 05:51.958
Always moisturizing.

05:54.416 --> 05:57.416
Hey, what was the name
of that girl you pulled in that club?

05:57.708 --> 05:58.708
Echoes?

05:58.791 --> 05:59.875
Echoes, Echoes, Echoes.

05:59.958 --> 06:02.000
Go on.

06:02.666 --> 06:03.791
Did, uh...

06:04.416 --> 06:05.791
did she have a tight pussy?

06:05.916 --> 06:08.125
- Was it shaved?
- Can I ask you a question, Ade?

06:08.416 --> 06:09.291
Is it dirty?

06:09.375 --> 06:13.916
How do you square your all-consuming
hunt for minge with your Christian faith?

06:14.208 --> 06:15.226
What kind of question's that?

06:15.250 --> 06:18.166
What, just giving you some practice
for all them interviews you're doing.

06:18.250 --> 06:21.125
Yeah, well. You know...

06:21.250 --> 06:24.250
Black warrior prince
needs his pussy, so...

06:24.583 --> 06:26.833
- He likes talking about it.
- Huh?

06:26.916 --> 06:28.083
More pussy than you.

06:28.166 --> 06:29.500
You been checking?

06:29.583 --> 06:31.416
Ignorant white man.

06:31.583 --> 06:32.791
I wouldn't worry, Ade.

06:33.375 --> 06:35.541
I'm sure your dad's covered you
in a blanket of prayer.

06:35.625 --> 06:37.125
Sweet. Make fun of my dad!

06:37.208 --> 06:39.583
Oh! He's a nutter
and you've said it yourself.

06:39.666 --> 06:40.851
Yeah, well, he's my dad, all right?

06:40.875 --> 06:42.809
Do you know Jesus, Jason?

06:42.833 --> 06:45.041
Do you know him in your heart?
Straight off the bat.

06:45.125 --> 06:47.208
- Don't start...
- "Oh, hello, Mr Lotomo.

06:47.291 --> 06:49.051
- Do you know Jesus?"
- All right, all right.

06:49.125 --> 06:52.583
Like, what was that, erm...
What was that thing he said? Erm...

06:53.166 --> 06:55.500
"If there is sin in your..."

06:55.583 --> 06:57.476
"If there is sin in your heart,

06:57.500 --> 06:58.916
cast it out!"

06:59.166 --> 07:03.416
"How can a man outrun the devil,
if the devil is in your heart?"

07:05.083 --> 07:06.517
It's the longest grace I've ever heard.

07:06.541 --> 07:08.916
My tea was cold
by the time he'd finished.

07:09.041 --> 07:10.250
Imagine living with him.

07:11.791 --> 07:12.833
You believe him, though?

07:14.500 --> 07:15.833
- Some of it.
- Yeah?

07:17.416 --> 07:20.041
- Do you pray?
- Yeah.

07:20.250 --> 07:22.541
What for?

07:23.916 --> 07:24.916
You should try it.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.875
Don't you fucking dare...

07:26.958 --> 07:28.791
- What?
- No, don't try and convert me.

07:28.875 --> 07:31.125
- I'm just saying.
- You're a closet nut.

07:33.833 --> 07:35.541
He cracks me up, your dad.

07:35.625 --> 07:36.625
He likes you.

07:36.666 --> 07:38.916
Oh, by telling me
I got the devil in my heart?

07:39.041 --> 07:41.750
That's his... that's his way.
That actually means he respects you.

07:43.041 --> 07:45.161
Does he ever tell you
you got the devil in your heart?

07:47.291 --> 07:48.375
You recording this?

07:52.916 --> 07:54.833
You'll wipe over the tape, man.

07:54.916 --> 07:57.041
What, Jojo's skanky home porn?

07:57.125 --> 07:58.791
There's a loss to world cinema.

08:00.458 --> 08:01.458
Stop pointing it at me.

08:05.875 --> 08:06.875
Oi!

08:17.583 --> 08:18.875
What do you reckon about Deano?

08:19.750 --> 08:21.416
- Deano?
- Mmm.

08:22.291 --> 08:23.833
If Deano was a lolly,

08:24.500 --> 08:26.083
he'd lick himself to death.

08:30.708 --> 08:33.433
Yeah, a couple of weeks back after drills,
we was all in the shower...

08:33.457 --> 08:34.457
Hmm?

08:34.750 --> 08:36.916
And everyone was talking about squad.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.433
These times,
we didn't know we'd be in it.

08:38.457 --> 08:40.250
- Yeah.
- And Deano was there

08:40.332 --> 08:42.666
and before I thought,
"This guy's a prick.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.934
Always in your face in training,
giving you a little kick."

08:44.958 --> 08:47.916
And he come up to me
and he's all asking me about myself.

08:48.333 --> 08:50.500
Like, man's taking a proper interest,
you know, Deano,

08:50.583 --> 08:51.958
he's all saying,
"Don't sweat it.

08:52.041 --> 08:53.625
I know what it's like.
Don't worry."

08:54.458 --> 08:55.375
And I'm thinking,

08:55.458 --> 08:57.098
- "This guy's actually all right."
- Yeah.

08:57.333 --> 08:59.791
And then...

09:00.791 --> 09:02.416
Then I notice everyone is laughing,

09:03.208 --> 09:05.875
because Deano is pissing down my leg.
The whole time we're talking,

09:05.958 --> 09:08.541
he is pissing down my leg in the shower.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.916
Why you laughing?

09:13.833 --> 09:16.625
Oh, he's like that with everyone.

09:16.708 --> 09:18.228
Oh, what, has he pissed down your leg?

09:19.208 --> 09:20.208
Nah.

09:21.916 --> 09:24.000
I think he's a bit racist.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.000
Deano? Nah.

09:26.083 --> 09:28.041
Well, not racist,
but the things he says, though.

09:28.125 --> 09:29.416
It's a sign of affection.

09:30.125 --> 09:31.333
Pissing on my leg?

09:31.416 --> 09:32.750
He's from Portsmouth.

09:33.791 --> 09:34.875
It's cultural.

09:36.916 --> 09:38.596
Besides, he never passes it
in five-a-side.

09:38.833 --> 09:41.041
Uh-huh. Told me he rated you.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.333
- Did he say that?
- Yeah.

09:46.541 --> 09:48.141
On the coach when we were playing cards.

09:49.375 --> 09:50.958
Is that what you lot talk about?

09:51.791 --> 09:53.333
Compared you to Bergkamp.

09:53.791 --> 09:54.791
Bergkamp?

09:54.916 --> 09:57.708
Said you got the potential
to be the next Dennis Bergkamp...

09:59.458 --> 10:00.833
Or was it Dennis Wise?

10:01.458 --> 10:02.375
Fuck off.

10:02.458 --> 10:05.833
Ah, it was the black Dennis Wise.
That's what he called you.

10:05.916 --> 10:08.291
- You should be on telly, mate.
- Hoo-hoo, I will be, mate.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.641
He's gonna regret when I take his place.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.333
Pass and move.
Drop. Pass and move.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.541
Pass and move.

10:36.791 --> 10:38.416
How come you do your own boots, man?

10:40.291 --> 10:41.625
I like the smell of polish.

10:42.458 --> 10:43.708
Get you hard, does it?

10:43.958 --> 10:46.416
Not as hard as your sister
when she sits on my face.

10:47.041 --> 10:48.958
- I done told you, man.
- What?

10:49.583 --> 10:52.333
Is she not like the other girls, Ade?
Is she special?

10:53.541 --> 10:55.750
All right. All right.

10:56.541 --> 10:59.125
Oi, I think she likes me, though.

10:59.208 --> 11:00.333
Ah!

11:02.083 --> 11:03.291
Is that your ritual?

11:04.750 --> 11:07.958
Every Saturday,
Dad would lay his paper down,

11:08.291 --> 11:09.333
pop the telly on,

11:09.791 --> 11:11.500
polish his boots in the front room.

11:11.708 --> 11:13.416
Mum would go spare.

11:15.833 --> 11:16.875
That his kit, yeah?

11:18.833 --> 11:20.458
Come to all your games, don't he?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
- Mmm.
- In his Jag.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.625
- Yeah, one of 'em.
- "One of 'em"?

11:27.083 --> 11:28.291
How many houses you got again?

11:28.708 --> 11:32.041
Uh... He's a builder.

11:32.375 --> 11:33.416
It's what he does.

11:33.666 --> 11:34.666
Mmm.

11:36.291 --> 11:39.500
Yeah, my dad's too busy
with his sermons.

11:40.541 --> 11:45.916
Well, he came to that thing
you was in for your, um, drama exam.

11:46.166 --> 11:49.083
Rah.
I forgot you come to that.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.000
Yeah, well, you were good in that.

11:51.583 --> 11:54.083
Yeah, what was that thing you did
where you had that

11:54.166 --> 11:56.083
red material you pulled and then...

11:56.166 --> 11:58.666
That was abstract movement, yeah.
That represent...

12:00.458 --> 12:03.916
- What you laughing at?
- Nah. No, I'm just remembering.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.250
It was...

12:05.333 --> 12:08.458
"Oh, oh. I love this person."

12:10.000 --> 12:13.333
- No, it was good.
- Mmm.

12:14.666 --> 12:16.166
I was surprised you come to that.

12:18.750 --> 12:19.875
Give us a blast.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.500
Go on! Argh!

12:23.750 --> 12:24.958
I can't do it to order.

12:25.041 --> 12:26.458
Ah, too much pressure?

12:42.791 --> 12:44.583
Make sure you wash your hands!

12:53.625 --> 12:55.250
How'd you know how to play poker?

12:55.541 --> 12:56.583
What's that, mate?

12:56.666 --> 12:58.625
On the bus.

12:59.875 --> 13:01.375
You was playing with the older lot.

13:03.125 --> 13:05.625
- Your dad teach you?
- Ah, yeah, yeah.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.833
He'd win my pocket money back off me.

13:07.916 --> 13:08.833
What?

13:08.916 --> 13:11.458
Yeah. He'd give me pocket money.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.791
We'd play cards, then he'd win it back.

13:16.166 --> 13:17.958
Said it was a lesson in life.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.250
Would you teach me to play?

13:24.500 --> 13:25.500
Jase?

13:32.916 --> 13:34.916
Ade, it is me,

13:35.000 --> 13:36.416
Babatunde.

13:36.500 --> 13:37.625
What the fuck, man?

13:37.708 --> 13:39.625
Your long-lost brother from Nigeria!

13:39.708 --> 13:41.142
- Are you kidding me?
- Come here, Ade.

13:41.166 --> 13:44.041
- Show your brother some love. Oh!
- Get the fuck away from me!

13:44.125 --> 13:46.083
Why you treat me so harshly?

13:46.166 --> 13:49.166
I've come so far to see you.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.000
Hey, it is me.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.043
Your brother from Nigeria
you didn't know you had.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.416
Your father had many children.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.166
Seriously, get the fuck away from me.

13:56.250 --> 13:59.416
Why you so sad to see
Babatunde? Ade.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.583
Ade, come on, mate.
I'm only having a laugh. Oi.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.083
Oi. It's just a bit of banter.

14:09.583 --> 14:11.958
You all right, geez?

14:12.041 --> 14:13.241
You all right, me old diamond?

14:13.291 --> 14:14.684
Me old china?

14:14.708 --> 14:17.083
- Want some plums?
- I want to see your plums.

14:17.166 --> 14:19.291
Two for a pound! Two for a pound!

14:19.375 --> 14:23.000
Would you like a cup of tea? Crumpet,
me lady? Come and have a look!

14:23.083 --> 14:26.291
- Yeah, mate.
- I'm on your bed, brother. What is that?

14:26.375 --> 14:28.916
- You what? Get your hands off my plums.
- Ah!

14:29.000 --> 14:30.750
Two plums in a brown bag!

14:30.833 --> 14:32.541
- You want these plums?
- Oh! Oh, oh!

14:32.625 --> 14:34.416
You what? Eh!

14:34.500 --> 14:37.166
- Oh, ah!
- Eh! There you go.

14:39.708 --> 14:41.559
Oh, you dirty bugger.

14:41.583 --> 14:44.625
Oh, I just tasted
your chocolate salty balls.

14:44.708 --> 14:46.708
Ah! I've got chocolate on my balls!

14:46.791 --> 14:48.059
- Ah!
- No, no, no, no, no.

14:48.083 --> 14:49.833
I'm never having chocolate spread again!

14:55.791 --> 14:56.875
I ain't answering that.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.375
- Oi, budge up.
- Oi!

15:12.541 --> 15:14.708
- So, you going to teach me?
- Teach you what?

15:15.083 --> 15:16.166
Play poker.

15:18.333 --> 15:21.041
What? You, play poker?

15:24.333 --> 15:25.333
What?

15:25.416 --> 15:26.458
You serious?

15:26.541 --> 15:28.500
Yeah.

15:28.583 --> 15:30.041
Oh, don't be funny.

15:30.250 --> 15:32.958
Come on, you need
a certain type of brain.

15:34.250 --> 15:35.570
You think you're smarter than me?

15:36.458 --> 15:37.958
Oh, shush.

15:38.291 --> 15:39.416
Let's just leave it, yeah?

15:39.500 --> 15:41.750
No, no, no. Oh, wait.
How much you win today?

15:41.833 --> 15:43.625
Huh?

15:43.791 --> 15:45.291
- Hmm?
- Oh. Oh, you lost?

15:45.375 --> 15:47.500
Ah. Is that because
you're so good at poker?

15:47.583 --> 15:50.041
What is this? The big boys
didn't let you into their game?

15:50.125 --> 15:52.333
- No, how much they take off you?
- Don't know.

15:53.791 --> 15:54.833
A monkey.

15:54.916 --> 15:57.583
- Five hundred pounds?
- Yeah.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.500
Yeah, Ade, pounds,
English pounds. 500 pounds.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.083
In half an hour?

16:03.083 --> 16:05.041
Ha-ha! Well, next week I'll win it back.

16:05.125 --> 16:07.083
Ooh, if you're playing.

16:08.458 --> 16:09.858
Yeah? What's that supposed to mean?

16:10.291 --> 16:11.833
You might not be picked next week.

16:13.541 --> 16:15.000
Well, we both might not be picked.

16:15.666 --> 16:16.791
I will be.

16:17.666 --> 16:19.583
Okay. So you're saying
you're better than me?

16:22.375 --> 16:23.750
- Come on.
- Ah.

16:25.958 --> 16:28.875
- Let's leave it, yeah?
- No, no, actually I'm intrigued.

16:29.583 --> 16:33.458
Oh, no, no. Oh, I understand.

16:34.166 --> 16:35.000
What?

16:35.083 --> 16:36.666
- Ah!
- What?

16:37.791 --> 16:40.291
I understand.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.916
You don't understand nothing.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.476
You're just saying that to seem
more mysterious, like you know something.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.916
Pressure's getting to you.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.291
It's making you act up.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.640
I ain't the one
who messed up today, okay?

16:52.666 --> 16:53.833
What you talking about?

16:55.583 --> 16:57.023
What do you think I'm talking about?

16:57.208 --> 16:59.666
Do you really want to do this?

17:02.250 --> 17:03.559
You were supposed to be marking him.

17:03.583 --> 17:04.767
You were supposed to be covering.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.250
- It was your zone!
- I pushed up.

17:06.333 --> 17:08.642
It was your zone!
That was the whole point in that session.

17:08.665 --> 17:11.476
We were playing the overlap. That means
my man becomes your man, vice versa.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.500
Every time before I've pushed on,
you dropped back.

17:13.583 --> 17:15.665
- So I pushed up that time.
- I was already up.

17:15.750 --> 17:18.875
- Look, it wasn't me coach shouted at.
- I know. I know it wasn't.

17:18.958 --> 17:21.125
- What was I supposed to do?
- Not go flying up

17:21.208 --> 17:23.333
when I was already up,
leaving us open at the back!

17:23.415 --> 17:24.583
It was only a training game!

17:24.665 --> 17:26.625
Well, I'm saying in the game,

17:27.165 --> 17:28.958
don't leave me looking
like I lost my man.

17:29.041 --> 17:31.250
I'm saying in the game,
don't lose your man.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.166
Uh! We were playing the overlap.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.476
That means my man... where you going?

17:35.500 --> 17:37.434
- Don't just fucking walk off...
- I'm going for a piss.

17:37.458 --> 17:39.767
- No, we were talking, don't just walk off.
- I'm going for a piss, okay?

17:39.791 --> 17:42.333
- Oh, yes, okay.
- Good. Oh, just so as you know,

17:42.416 --> 17:44.666
I'll be leaving a space
this side of the room.

17:44.750 --> 17:48.291
You think it's too big, Jase, you might
want to push up and cover it.

17:48.375 --> 17:50.541
Next time you fancy a shot at glory,

17:50.625 --> 17:53.708
how about you give me
a bit of advance notice, you cunt?

18:05.125 --> 18:06.333
They were laughing at you.

18:07.541 --> 18:10.708
Deano, Leesy, laughing
at taking your money at cards

18:10.791 --> 18:13.231
- and how you think you're one of the boys.
- That's bollocks.

18:15.125 --> 18:16.875
Said they thought you was a bit suspect.

18:18.333 --> 18:21.208
When was this?

18:21.291 --> 18:23.250
- When you was in the shower.
- How do you mean?

18:23.833 --> 18:26.000
- Different.
- Different. Different?

18:26.083 --> 18:27.666
What's that supposed to mean, huh?

18:32.041 --> 18:33.041
A bit...

18:35.000 --> 18:36.041
you know, man.

18:37.833 --> 18:39.166
No, I don't know.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.291
A bit posh, mate.

18:47.875 --> 18:50.916
Posh?

18:51.541 --> 18:56.208
I'm from Stanford-Le-fucking-Hope!

18:56.875 --> 18:58.666
You ain't exactly from the Ends, are you?

19:08.291 --> 19:09.416
I'm having a beer.

19:10.166 --> 19:11.458
Cracking up, is it?

19:12.375 --> 19:14.695
Look, let's not pretend
that we don't know what's going on.

19:17.166 --> 19:19.416
They can't keep us both on,
not with this new formation.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.416
Yeah, I know that, Ade.
I am not thick.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.166
There is a window.
I can see it closing.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.083
If I'm in a better position tomorrow

19:26.166 --> 19:29.458
and I'm on, will you pass me the ball?

19:30.875 --> 19:32.125
This guy...

19:37.916 --> 19:40.541
When your chance come, Jase,
you best take it,

19:40.625 --> 19:42.906
'cause that's what I'm going to do.
It's nothing personal.

19:43.041 --> 19:44.666
Really? Really?

19:45.750 --> 19:47.166
Maybe I need this more than you.

19:51.916 --> 19:54.458
This is stupid.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.416
Look, whatever happens...

19:58.750 --> 20:02.958
we... will always be brothers, yeah?

20:03.833 --> 20:07.000
- Here.
- No. We got a game tomorrow.

20:07.083 --> 20:10.166
Ade, are you leaving me hanging?

20:11.958 --> 20:12.958
Ade...

20:15.041 --> 20:16.166
We're brothers.

20:31.083 --> 20:34.041
You doughnut.

20:36.916 --> 20:38.083
Frickin' hell, man.

20:38.625 --> 20:41.958
- What's the mat... oi!
- Ah! Ah!

20:42.291 --> 20:44.458
- What, huh? Yeah?
- Oh, you fucker! Don't stop.

20:44.541 --> 20:46.833
- Shall I give you a hug? Huh?
- Oh, yes, yes, don't stop.

20:46.916 --> 20:49.500
- Do you want to squeeze me plums?
- I'll squeeze your plums.

20:50.541 --> 20:51.875
He does it all! Matron!

20:51.958 --> 20:53.500
Ah! Ah!

20:53.583 --> 20:55.166
What the fuck?

20:55.375 --> 20:57.458
- I'll feel your plums.
- Seriously, what the fuck?

20:58.333 --> 21:00.083
- What?
- You got a fucking hard-on!

21:00.166 --> 21:01.541
- No, I don't.
- No, you did, mate.

21:01.625 --> 21:04.083
- I felt it. You had a fucking hard-on.
- No.

21:04.166 --> 21:05.406
- Nah, man.
- You did.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.958
I won't be keeping this to myself.

21:09.208 --> 21:11.791
- Please, man. Mate, it's nothing. I...
- Oh, no, man, no.

21:11.875 --> 21:14.583
- No, I'll tell everyone about this.
- I get nervous before a game.

21:14.666 --> 21:16.166
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wait. Huh?

21:17.083 --> 21:18.083
Pulling your leg.

21:18.166 --> 21:19.583
Doughnut.

21:19.708 --> 21:21.541
Oi, I'm pulling your leg.

21:24.875 --> 21:28.000
Loads of people get a hard-on
before a game.

21:28.625 --> 21:29.625
I know I do.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.458
I get a massive hard-on.

21:32.583 --> 21:35.666
- Do you?
- Yeah, of course.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.375
You all right?

21:40.958 --> 21:43.416
All right? You look scared.

21:43.500 --> 21:44.541
Why would I be scared?

21:45.875 --> 21:46.875
Oh.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.833
Give us a cuddle.

21:51.458 --> 21:53.625
You bum boy.

21:55.208 --> 21:56.583
Oh...

21:58.375 --> 22:00.666
oh...

22:10.458 --> 22:13.208
- You're very huggable, Ade.
- Piss off.

23:07.291 --> 23:08.291
Doughnut.

23:33.583 --> 23:36.333
Oh. Oh. Oh!

23:37.916 --> 23:41.291
- Oh, oh.
- He just popped you?

23:41.375 --> 23:43.291
Oh, fuck. If he's broken it,
I won't be happy.

23:43.375 --> 23:46.083
- Oh, fuck.
- I reckon it's an improvement, actually.

23:46.166 --> 23:47.875
Oh, well, that's nice. Sympathy.

23:47.958 --> 23:50.000
My nan hits harder than that.

23:50.083 --> 23:51.563
Is she a bit of a bruiser?

23:51.625 --> 23:54.291
Argh! Argh! Shit!

23:54.375 --> 23:56.625
- Serves you right, you cheeky bastard.
- Argh!

23:56.708 --> 23:59.666
Oh, this fucking... oh, fuck.

24:04.416 --> 24:06.333
- Do I look sexy?
- Mmm.

24:06.416 --> 24:09.041
Blood on your shirt, bust-up nose.
You look well fit.

24:09.125 --> 24:11.208
Yeah? Girls like that, bit of blood.

24:11.291 --> 24:14.125
Oh, yeah. I love a fella
who can't handle himself.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.375
Think I broke his camera, the twat.

24:17.458 --> 24:19.666
I know. Why do you think he was so upset?

24:19.750 --> 24:22.790
Oh, you know what, I'd have floored him
if you hadn't got in the fucking way.

24:23.375 --> 24:25.208
Hold your head back, soft lad.

24:25.291 --> 24:26.958
Oh, careful, careful, careful, careful.

24:27.041 --> 24:28.041
Ah.

24:28.541 --> 24:31.583
Them bouncers were, like, bosh.

24:31.666 --> 24:33.500
He was shitting himself.

24:33.583 --> 24:35.708
I know, I could smell it.

24:35.791 --> 24:36.958
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi.

24:39.125 --> 24:42.125
- Do I not look a bit sexy? Huh?
- Oh.

24:42.875 --> 24:45.000
- Maybes a bit.
- Ah.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.750
Ah.

24:55.958 --> 25:00.000
Clean yourself up, you little slut.

25:01.916 --> 25:04.416
- Get us a shirt.
- Where are they?

25:04.500 --> 25:07.125
Uh, should be some clobber on the bed.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.125
Someone's been eating
their Shredded Wheat.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.333
Huh? Huh?

25:52.541 --> 25:54.791
Oh, you look like you're taking a shit.

26:00.416 --> 26:03.958
What's that?
Is that your sexy face?

26:04.125 --> 26:05.250
No.

26:05.833 --> 26:07.208
It's my cum face.

26:11.458 --> 26:13.375
Oh, does that happen a lot?

26:13.875 --> 26:15.958
Getting hassle off the paparazzi?

26:16.041 --> 26:17.708
Oh, normally they're all right.

26:17.875 --> 26:19.041
It's all fun and games.

26:20.083 --> 26:22.125
- I'm going to have a piss.
- Can I watch?

26:23.541 --> 26:25.000
All right.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.333
- Fucking hell.
- Do you want to hold me plonker?

26:27.416 --> 26:30.541
- No, you're all right, pet.
- Well, it's your loss. It's a whopper.

26:35.625 --> 26:37.041
Ah.

26:38.833 --> 26:40.125
Fucking hell.

26:42.541 --> 26:44.083
Put some music on!

26:45.458 --> 26:46.583
Something jolly.

26:55.791 --> 26:57.500
Remote's in the wall!

26:58.250 --> 26:59.291
Got it!

27:07.791 --> 27:11.000
Is this what you listen to?

27:11.083 --> 27:12.500
What are you, 16?

27:12.583 --> 27:14.541
Oi! Fuck off, he's a mate.

27:15.291 --> 27:18.708
- Are you joking?
- Did my birthday out in Miami.

27:18.791 --> 27:20.125
Are you serious?

27:45.541 --> 27:46.916
Jesus, man.

27:49.166 --> 27:50.500
Footballers.

27:58.291 --> 28:00.041
Fuck me.

28:00.583 --> 28:01.833
Are you a ninja?

28:02.500 --> 28:05.583
- It's all right, isn't it?
- It's a bit like where I live.

28:05.666 --> 28:07.541
Uh-huh.

28:08.708 --> 28:10.000
Do you come here often?

28:10.500 --> 28:12.333
Uh, yeah,

28:12.416 --> 28:15.875
I try to stay on an extra day
if we got a game down here if I can.

28:15.958 --> 28:18.500
They know me. They're discrete.

28:19.083 --> 28:20.791
You got family down here?

28:21.916 --> 28:24.083
Yeah. Mum and Dad still out east.

28:27.708 --> 28:28.875
Mmm.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.208
Let's do this inside.

28:35.291 --> 28:37.791
Fuck off.
You're not on a promise.

28:37.875 --> 28:39.541
Oh, why, you think you can resist me?

28:39.625 --> 28:43.000
- All right. Easy, tiger.
- Oh, come on, I'm horny.

28:43.083 --> 28:45.625
- Oh, my God.
- What?

28:45.708 --> 28:48.166
Nothing.

28:48.750 --> 28:50.000
It's just you.

28:50.666 --> 28:51.708
What?

28:52.041 --> 28:53.750
You're not how I thought you'd be.

28:53.833 --> 28:56.208
- Yeah?
- I thought you'd be less...

28:56.916 --> 28:57.916
Intelligent?

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Needy.

29:01.125 --> 29:02.125
"Needy"?

29:02.250 --> 29:04.708
That's the wrong word. Vulnerable.

29:05.458 --> 29:08.000
Vulnerable? What's that mean?

29:08.083 --> 29:10.166
It's like you need constant stimulation.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.583
Yeah, I do need constant stimulation.

29:15.708 --> 29:18.458
I bet you were an annoying kid
that needed constant attention.

29:18.541 --> 29:21.625
- Teachers fucking loved me.
- Oh, you're one of those kids.

29:21.708 --> 29:23.375
Ah. I was quite popular.

29:23.458 --> 29:25.041
And what happened?

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
Oh, what?

29:30.416 --> 29:32.916
Oh, what? Did I annoy you?

29:33.250 --> 29:34.750
Oh, I did, didn't I?

29:35.208 --> 29:37.291
Oh, is it 'cause I called you vulnerable?

29:37.375 --> 29:39.434
- Let me tell you something, right?
- What, is it about you?

29:39.458 --> 29:41.851
- My first proper game five years back,
- Your favourite subject.

29:41.875 --> 29:42.958
- We was in Romania.
- Yeah.

29:43.041 --> 29:44.976
It was my mate's first game, too.
Away game in Romania.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.666
- Is it a football story? Yes!
- We were nervous as shit. Shh!

29:47.750 --> 29:50.583
And the ball comes to me
at the edge of the box this high.

29:50.666 --> 29:52.750
And I had a choice then...

29:53.000 --> 29:56.250
Whether to knock it out to my mate
or take the shot, 30 yards out.

29:56.333 --> 29:58.614
He's in a better position,
I should have passed, I didn't.

29:58.666 --> 30:01.416
I hit it first time, bosh, top corner.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.916
Before I had time to blink,
it had gone in, bang!

30:04.333 --> 30:06.958
Just like that. Goal of the season.

30:08.375 --> 30:10.916
What, so this is just a story
about how great you are?

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
No!

30:12.041 --> 30:14.083
You called me vulnerable
and I'm just saying,

30:14.166 --> 30:16.846
you got to take your chances
where they come 'cause life ain't fair,

30:16.916 --> 30:19.541
and when it comes to it,
there ain't no room for emotion.

30:21.500 --> 30:24.750
And how did your mate feel,
the one that you didn't pass to?

30:25.458 --> 30:26.833
Mmm, never asked.

30:28.541 --> 30:29.916
Is he still your mate?

30:36.541 --> 30:37.583
Yo.

30:46.708 --> 30:49.208
Just, uh, put it on the side there,
please, mate.

31:07.208 --> 31:08.250
What you looking at?

31:44.458 --> 31:45.500
Whoa.

31:51.208 --> 31:53.291
Mm.

31:55.416 --> 31:57.541
Come on. Show us what you got.

31:59.583 --> 32:02.541
Come on! Come on!
Give us a private show.

32:07.541 --> 32:09.041
It's my night off.

32:09.541 --> 32:10.851
You were dancing in the club tonight.

32:10.875 --> 32:12.333
- Well, that was work.
- So?

32:21.500 --> 32:24.000
I like to keep work
and my private life separate.

32:24.083 --> 32:25.083
Oh, yeah?

32:26.625 --> 32:29.083
I'm just going to go and powder my nose.

32:29.166 --> 32:32.208
- Mm? Do you mean have a piss?
- Mm-hmm.

32:32.583 --> 32:36.458
A nice long hot one
dedicated to you.

33:23.166 --> 33:25.291
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

33:25.708 --> 33:26.708
What?

33:27.750 --> 33:29.208
Your moves!

33:29.625 --> 33:33.000
Ah! All right. Yeah, baby.

33:33.083 --> 33:36.208
What, is that your moves?

33:36.291 --> 33:37.416
Yeah, you like?

33:38.125 --> 33:40.333
Mm-hmm, there's plenty more
where that came from.

33:40.416 --> 33:42.791
- Go on, then.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:42.875 --> 33:44.791
I'd say you'd better call
emergency services

33:44.875 --> 33:48.125
- 'cause some of these are dangerous.
- You nearly took me eye out.

33:48.208 --> 33:49.666
There's, er, this.

33:51.333 --> 33:52.541
Yeah, yeah, there's this.

33:52.625 --> 33:56.583
What's that, ba-ba?
Oh-ba-ba-ba-ba-na, ba-ba-ba!

33:56.666 --> 33:58.583
And there's this. There's this.

33:58.666 --> 34:01.916
What's this? Oh! Oh, what's this?
What's this cheeky little fellow?

34:02.000 --> 34:05.291
What's he doing, eh?
He's on fire. The boy is on fire.

34:05.375 --> 34:06.833
What is that, Lord of the Dance?

34:06.916 --> 34:09.416
You are in the presence
of something special here.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.958
Ah, yeah, special's the word.

34:12.041 --> 34:15.916
That routine you did at the club tonight,
that was impressive.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.500
- Well, it's harder than people think.
- What, dancing around a pole?

34:19.583 --> 34:21.458
Or kicking a ball?

34:26.625 --> 34:29.541
- Do you like that?
- Yeah, right there. Mm-hmm.

34:31.250 --> 34:32.583
Show us your tits.

34:36.625 --> 34:39.583
All right. Slow down, man.

34:39.666 --> 34:42.208
Mm-hmm. Take it off.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.041
Come on, take it off.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.916
Come on. Take it off.
You hear what I said? Take it off.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.750
I said take it off. Come on.

34:48.833 --> 34:49.958
I'm sorry.

34:50.625 --> 34:54.125
Sorry. I can't do this.

34:55.291 --> 34:56.541
Can't do what?

34:57.750 --> 35:00.166
This. I can't do this. I'm just...

35:15.708 --> 35:16.833
Is this what you're after?

35:18.750 --> 35:20.041
Can I have my bag, please?

35:21.000 --> 35:22.875
I'm... I'm just going to go.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.083
No, you don't.

35:27.541 --> 35:30.083
- Just give us me bag.
- What do you need your bag for?

35:30.166 --> 35:31.916
- Well, it's got my stuff.
- What "stuff"?

35:32.000 --> 35:33.291
Lipstick, tissues.

35:33.375 --> 35:36.166
- What? Do you want an inventory?
- Yeah, what else?

35:36.250 --> 35:39.833
There might be a bit of fluff
and a tampon, I'm not sure.

35:39.916 --> 35:41.166
And the camera?

35:43.833 --> 35:46.125
- Camera?
- Mm-hmm.

35:47.166 --> 35:49.916
There's a camera on my phone,
if that's what you're talking about.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Mm-hmm.

35:55.041 --> 35:56.083
What are you doing?

35:59.208 --> 36:02.458
- Right, I'm calling the police.
- No, you ain't calling no one.

36:02.541 --> 36:04.017
I'm calling them.
You paranoid bastard.

36:04.041 --> 36:06.625
Good. We'll have a chat with them
about this and all, shall we?

36:07.416 --> 36:08.458
Fuck.

36:16.083 --> 36:17.416
It wasn't my idea.

36:21.208 --> 36:23.125
They approached me.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.208
I've never done this before, all right?
I'm not that sort of person.

36:30.291 --> 36:32.750
Oh, yeah. Well, apparently you are.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.625
Look, I thought I could do it,
but I was wrong, all right?

36:37.125 --> 36:39.541
Just... just give us me keys
and me purse.

36:39.625 --> 36:41.291
I'm... I'm just going to go.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.208
But you can't go.

36:44.375 --> 36:45.583
Why can't I?

36:47.416 --> 36:49.708
'Cause of what you signed, darlin'.

36:51.458 --> 36:54.791
What? How do you know
what I signed or I didn't sign?

36:58.708 --> 37:00.041
Did you know about this?

37:00.541 --> 37:04.083
What, do you...
do you think I'm fucking stupid?

37:05.041 --> 37:06.166
Of course I know.

37:08.750 --> 37:10.458
Are you saying that you planned this?

37:12.125 --> 37:14.541
What the fuck is going on,
'cause this is...

37:15.625 --> 37:19.583
Why would you... why would you
film yourself cheating on your wife?

37:20.333 --> 37:22.291
Was this... was this a dare or...

37:22.375 --> 37:24.416
some way of proving that you're...

37:25.166 --> 37:26.375
A man or...

37:26.458 --> 37:27.708
Ah.

37:30.541 --> 37:32.708
- Let's have a drink.
- What?

37:33.041 --> 37:35.333
I got the mood wrong.
You know, I misjudged things.

37:35.416 --> 37:36.517
Come on, let's have a drink.

37:36.541 --> 37:39.458
I was just talking sexy,
you know, I was talking a bit dirty.

37:39.541 --> 37:41.976
I was trying to get you into it.
Thought you'd be into it. That's all.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.250
It was just sexy talk.
I didn't mean nothing.

37:44.333 --> 37:46.500
I thought you'd like it,
but you didn't.

37:46.583 --> 37:48.250
I got the mood wrong, so let's just...

37:49.625 --> 37:51.458
Look, let's just take it nice and slow.

37:52.250 --> 37:54.125
You think we're still going to do this?

37:55.291 --> 37:56.458
Well, why not?

37:57.875 --> 37:59.041
Why not? It'll be laugh.

37:59.166 --> 38:00.625
- A "laugh"?
- Yeah.

38:00.708 --> 38:02.833
Well, making a sex tape
and selling it to the papers,

38:02.916 --> 38:04.916
that's a laugh for you, is it?

38:05.000 --> 38:06.958
What, that's a fucking weekend for you?

38:08.708 --> 38:09.875
Do you know what?

38:10.916 --> 38:12.458
- No, you don't.
- I've had enough.

38:12.541 --> 38:14.125
- No, no.
- No, you put your hands on me

38:14.208 --> 38:16.916
- and I'll scream my fucking head off!
- Keep your voice down.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.226
Don't tell me to keep my voice down.

38:18.250 --> 38:21.083
Fine, but let's just keep
our fucking heads, all right?

38:21.166 --> 38:23.500
Let's talk like mature fucking adults.

38:23.625 --> 38:25.333
Is that what you think we are?

38:27.500 --> 38:28.916
I want to know what's going on.

38:29.125 --> 38:31.267
- Fuck, just sit yourself down.
- I don't want to sit down!

38:31.291 --> 38:33.291
Oh, my fucking God.
Lyndsey, darling,

38:33.375 --> 38:34.851
I'm gathering my thoughts, all right?

38:34.875 --> 38:36.476
I can't think
with all this fucking hoopla.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.041
I'm gathering my thoughts.

38:39.500 --> 38:40.500
Je...

38:46.541 --> 38:47.541
Jesus.

38:50.666 --> 38:51.666
Look.

38:56.291 --> 38:58.291
- It's nothing.
- What's nothing?

38:58.375 --> 39:02.833
Some... some little dickhead's
shooting his mouth off telling stories.

39:02.916 --> 39:05.791
- It's just fucking bullshit.
- What's bullshit?

39:05.875 --> 39:07.684
It doesn't matter, what's bullshit,
because it ain't true.

39:07.708 --> 39:09.726
Well, if it doesn't matter,
why you doing this?

39:09.750 --> 39:11.791
Because he's telling stories.

39:11.875 --> 39:13.041
Well, what kind of stories?

39:13.125 --> 39:17.458
Look, uh, this is what I am trying
to explain to you, if you'd just listen.

39:18.375 --> 39:21.125
It doesn't matter what kind of stories,

39:21.208 --> 39:22.458
because they ain't true.

39:23.291 --> 39:25.458
- What kind of stories?
- Look...

39:28.458 --> 39:29.916
I'm having trouble with my wife.

39:31.416 --> 39:32.536
That's all you need to know.

39:33.166 --> 39:34.875
And this is your way of solving it?

39:34.958 --> 39:37.833
Who is advising you,
Russell fucking Brand?

39:37.916 --> 39:39.196
Look, we ain't together no more.

39:39.750 --> 39:40.791
Okay?

39:40.875 --> 39:43.791
We ain't together no more
and people don't know yet

39:43.875 --> 39:45.958
and she's trying to stop me
seeing my kids.

39:46.166 --> 39:48.333
And these kinds of rumours
are exactly the thing

39:48.416 --> 39:50.336
- I don't need right now.
- What kind of rumours?

40:00.291 --> 40:03.916
- Why are you laughing?
- Oh, my God.

40:04.083 --> 40:05.083
What?

40:06.375 --> 40:07.666
You're gay!

40:10.000 --> 40:12.875
- You what?
- You're gay, aren't you?

40:14.125 --> 40:16.833
That's what this is, that's what
this fella's been saying, isn't it?

40:16.916 --> 40:19.083
Gay? Gay?

40:19.166 --> 40:21.458
Are you out your fucking mind?
Gay? Of course I'm not gay.

40:21.958 --> 40:24.291
Look at me. I'm a footballer.

40:24.375 --> 40:26.208
Oh, yeah, yeah.
'Cause it's such a man's game.

40:26.291 --> 40:29.375
All of them buff lads together
and no one ever fancies a fuck?

40:29.458 --> 40:31.458
What, are you monks?

40:31.541 --> 40:32.851
Don't know what you're talking about.

40:32.875 --> 40:35.166
That's why you're always
doubling up with girls, isn't it?

40:35.250 --> 40:38.875
Even the straight lads can't get a hard-on
without another fuckin' fella in the room.

40:38.958 --> 40:43.083
People rely on me. I got responsibilities.
People expect things.

40:43.166 --> 40:45.184
- What's that got to do with being gay?
- I got fans.

40:45.208 --> 40:47.500
I got a family.
I'm a fucking role model.

40:47.583 --> 40:48.583
A role model?

40:48.625 --> 40:51.166
Little kids have posters of me
on their wall.

40:51.250 --> 40:53.833
Grown men and women buy fucking shirts,

40:53.916 --> 40:55.851
keyrings, mouse mats with my name on.

40:55.875 --> 40:58.916
Men get razor blades
because they're the ones I use.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.791
Japanese people drink
the same whiskey as me

41:00.875 --> 41:03.000
and it's all because
of the kind of man I am.

41:03.083 --> 41:05.875
So if you think I'm just going
to rock up to Mardi Gras

41:05.958 --> 41:07.833
with fucking feathers
falling out of my arse...

41:07.916 --> 41:09.976
- And then play football
- 'Cause that's what happens.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.500
In front of 70,000 fans, you're in cloud
fucking cuckoo land, darling.

41:13.583 --> 41:16.000
- Oh, my god.
- 'Cause I ain't gay.

41:17.916 --> 41:19.416
Gay ain't even an option.

41:22.791 --> 41:26.083
Jesus Christ, Jason,
what year do you think this is?

41:26.708 --> 41:29.791
What year? It's fucking 1966
out there, darling, hmm?

41:29.875 --> 41:31.958
It's fucking 1066.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.750
You know what?
I worked hard for this.

41:37.833 --> 41:41.166
I sweated blood, so if you think
I'm just going to give it up

41:41.250 --> 41:43.958
'cause some scratchy little cunt
is shooting his mouth off,

41:44.041 --> 41:45.875
trying to make a few quid, fuck off!

41:45.958 --> 41:48.208
Do you know what?
Maybes I will sit down.

41:48.291 --> 41:50.458
No, you stay on your feet!

41:54.458 --> 41:57.625
Do you... do you think it's just me, hmm?

41:59.083 --> 42:00.791
Do you think people are truthful?

42:00.875 --> 42:06.166
The whole world is full of people
pretending to be something they're not.

42:06.250 --> 42:08.958
The fuck I do or don't do

42:09.041 --> 42:12.416
with my life is up to me, right?

42:12.500 --> 42:16.833
No one else decides,
so if I say "I ain't gay", I ain't gay.

42:18.375 --> 42:21.291
The only thing that matters is
what I do on the pitch.

42:21.375 --> 42:24.416
So, if there are things I need
to get my head in the right place,

42:24.500 --> 42:26.916
if I need a wife and kid,

42:27.333 --> 42:30.750
yeah, if I need to fuck a woman,

42:32.541 --> 42:33.541
or a man...

42:34.458 --> 42:39.041
you know what, or a fucking apricot
for that matter, then that's what I do.

42:45.833 --> 42:46.833
Look.

42:49.083 --> 42:50.208
Let's just do this,

42:51.041 --> 42:52.041
huh?

42:52.708 --> 42:53.750
Let's just do it.

42:54.500 --> 42:55.750
You'll get your money.

42:56.750 --> 42:57.791
Everyone's happy.

42:57.875 --> 43:00.291
Yeah, it's just that, erm...

43:01.041 --> 43:03.583
I'm just not sure I want to any more,

43:03.666 --> 43:04.976
- do you know what I mean?
- You know what?

43:05.000 --> 43:07.291
Fuck off, as if you've got a choice.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.125
You don't know the first thing about me.

43:11.208 --> 43:12.851
You don't know what I need
or what I don't need.

43:12.875 --> 43:14.267
So don't tell me what I can or I can't do.

43:14.291 --> 43:16.059
'Cause you're not the one
that gets to fucking decide.

43:16.083 --> 43:19.833
Look, do you want
this fucking money or not?

43:23.250 --> 43:24.250
Nah.

43:31.083 --> 43:33.000
I want double what we agreed.

43:38.166 --> 43:40.208
Okay All right.

43:41.083 --> 43:42.250
Double it is.

43:51.750 --> 43:54.791
We'll have to, erm, reset it.

43:55.291 --> 43:57.083
It's got us talking on it.

44:19.291 --> 44:20.416
Have you done this before?

44:23.750 --> 44:25.375
- Would it make a difference?
- Yeah.

44:25.458 --> 44:27.434
Well, they were supposed to find
someone who'd done it before.

44:27.458 --> 44:29.333
- I told them I'd done it before.
- Why?

44:30.333 --> 44:32.583
Because they wanted someone
who'd done it before.

44:37.208 --> 44:38.291
You're not getting me.

44:40.208 --> 44:41.583
This isn't me.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.875
I'm playing a role, but you'd
know all about that, wouldn't you?

44:45.958 --> 44:48.438
- Just make it look good, all right?
- Oh, don't worry, I will.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.083
Who is he?

44:53.500 --> 44:54.750
Who are you thinking about?

44:56.458 --> 44:59.166
Because I can tell by looking
in your eyes it isn't me, is it?

46:04.208 --> 46:05.875
Come here, you cunt.

46:06.250 --> 46:07.416
Good to see you, man.

46:07.500 --> 46:09.541
You haven't changed. Look at you.

46:09.750 --> 46:12.375
Well, apart from that. What is that?

46:12.458 --> 46:14.833
This? It's what a man looks like.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.750
- Is it?
- Yeah.

46:17.125 --> 46:18.125
Come in.

46:19.458 --> 46:20.458
Drink?

46:22.708 --> 46:24.416
Got a nice Sancerre on the go.

46:25.458 --> 46:27.666
Yeah. Nice Sancerre sounds, er...

46:28.583 --> 46:30.625
Saw your website for your company.

46:31.125 --> 46:34.125
Some lovely testimonials.
"Excellent finish."

46:34.208 --> 46:36.833
- Yeah.
- That was Jojo and his missus.

46:36.916 --> 46:38.166
It's all right, innit?

46:39.041 --> 46:41.708
I got so much respect for you, Ade.

46:42.666 --> 46:43.666
Thanks.

46:44.458 --> 46:45.583
What do you reckon?

46:48.083 --> 46:50.000
- Yeah, man, it's good. Mmm.
- Yeah.

46:50.083 --> 46:51.963
Plenty more where that came from.

46:53.083 --> 46:54.250
Where's all your stuff?

46:54.708 --> 46:57.166
Mmm, everything's in storage.

46:57.250 --> 47:00.500
Karen got our place,
just for the kids, really.

47:00.875 --> 47:03.375
- Yeah, I was sorry to hear that, man.
- Yeah. Check this out.

47:04.833 --> 47:06.416
Bosh!

47:07.375 --> 47:09.208
So do you get to see 'em, the kids?

47:09.583 --> 47:12.166
Um, well, you know, it's tricky, that.

47:12.250 --> 47:13.500
I don't want to confuse 'em.

47:14.125 --> 47:15.208
You've seen the tape?

47:15.458 --> 47:17.083
Well, I didn't watch it, but...

47:17.166 --> 47:18.708
Expensive 12 minutes that was.

47:18.791 --> 47:21.125
- Only 12?
- If I'd known how popular it'd be

47:21.208 --> 47:23.375
I'd have drawn it out,
turned it into a box set.

47:23.458 --> 47:26.333
Erm, pass us them pills, will you?

47:28.625 --> 47:29.625
Chop, chop.

47:35.500 --> 47:38.458
Seeing as you're up, uh, fetch us a beer.

47:38.541 --> 47:39.958
The fridge is just there.

47:40.833 --> 47:42.208
What did your last slave die of?

47:42.291 --> 47:43.291
AIDS.

47:43.541 --> 47:44.583
AIDS.

47:49.458 --> 47:51.166
They're, uh...
they're for my knee.

47:52.666 --> 47:54.916
- I'm so used to them now, I forget.
- Mm.

48:02.291 --> 48:03.458
Do you still play?

48:03.541 --> 48:04.833
- I turn up.
- Hmm?

48:04.916 --> 48:06.416
- Whereabouts?
- Marshes.

48:08.041 --> 48:10.958
Hackney Marshes! Pitches still shit?

48:11.041 --> 48:12.750
Yes.

48:12.833 --> 48:15.000
I bet you're like Ronaldo with that lot.

48:15.083 --> 48:16.123
I am quite good, actually.

48:16.166 --> 48:19.291
Ah! "Ronaldo of the Marshes."

48:21.375 --> 48:22.958
My old man used to play there.

48:23.458 --> 48:25.375
Yeah. Read about it.

48:25.458 --> 48:27.083
Sorry, man.

48:28.375 --> 48:32.041
I didn't mind him skimming a bit,
you know, it's my dad. But it got silly.

48:32.458 --> 48:33.958
I had the taxman onto me.

48:35.166 --> 48:37.791
Oh, you know...
he's got his golf.

48:38.500 --> 48:40.460
Two hundred years old, that.
Belonged to Napoleon.

48:43.083 --> 48:45.375
How's your knee?
I heard you had keyhole.

48:45.458 --> 48:49.125
Arthroscopy. Pretty standard op
these days.

48:49.583 --> 48:53.375
I ain't the same over five yards,
but got it up here.

48:54.166 --> 48:56.642
I had it booked in a year back,
but they brought that Sierra Leone kid in.

48:56.666 --> 48:58.786
I thought, can't take time off now,
I'd lose my place.

48:59.125 --> 49:00.541
But after that sending off,

49:01.125 --> 49:04.541
thought missing the end of season,
may as well get it sorted.

49:04.625 --> 49:06.791
Five match ban.
That was pretty serious, man.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.351
Cunt had it coming.

49:09.375 --> 49:10.541
Pretty bad tackle, man.

49:11.875 --> 49:14.583
Giving it that all game
and just... uh...

49:16.583 --> 49:19.458
My mum was a bit shocked,
to be honest, you know?

49:19.666 --> 49:23.500
My concentration.
My time away, it's done me good.

49:25.083 --> 49:28.541
Go on, then.
You're on. Oh!

49:29.416 --> 49:31.000
See if you can beat my time.

49:45.291 --> 49:46.416
Hotel not got a gym?

49:46.541 --> 49:48.291
Uh.

49:48.375 --> 49:50.916
I can't be done with the hassle,
sweating away,

49:51.000 --> 49:53.458
someone wants an autograph
for his nephew every two seconds.

49:53.541 --> 49:55.291
Makes a good training base.

49:55.375 --> 49:59.375
Room service. Chef here's got two stars.
They got a 20-metre pool, too.

49:59.458 --> 50:00.458
I got me own key.

50:00.541 --> 50:02.267
I use it in the middle of the night
when it's quiet.

50:02.291 --> 50:03.916
When do you sleep?

50:04.083 --> 50:06.708
The amount of energy drinks
I'm on with this training regime,

50:06.791 --> 50:08.916
I'm up half the night.
Painkillers don't help.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.166
My clock is all wonky.

50:11.250 --> 50:14.875
I don't know if it's fucking night
or fucking day.

50:18.416 --> 50:20.916
- Do you swim?
- One K every day.

50:21.250 --> 50:22.416
Good boy!

50:23.375 --> 50:24.875
Do you do tumble turns?

50:24.958 --> 50:27.791
Proper turns, like on the Olympics.

50:28.625 --> 50:30.958
It's quite fun, this.

50:32.291 --> 50:33.916
See that dot? That's you.

50:34.458 --> 50:35.583
See the other dot?

50:36.208 --> 50:38.166
- What, the one in front?
- Uh-huh. That's me.

50:41.375 --> 50:45.583
Ah. Well, you'll mess your nice shirt up.

51:01.125 --> 51:04.291
Oh. Paul Smith, woo!

51:04.375 --> 51:05.875
Fuck off.

51:07.083 --> 51:08.750
Jojo says you're out of contract.

51:08.916 --> 51:10.666
- Says you're looking for a club.
- Yeah.

51:10.750 --> 51:12.125
I'm having a bit of a stocktake.

51:12.708 --> 51:14.916
Ah. Something about a club in India?

51:15.250 --> 51:17.166
Super League.
That's where the money is.

51:17.250 --> 51:19.226
They're setting up the infrastructure,
getting players in.

51:19.250 --> 51:21.875
- India, though?
- Well, good enough for Del Piero.

51:21.958 --> 51:23.833
End of his career.

51:23.916 --> 51:24.956
You're getting old, is it?

51:25.000 --> 51:27.101
You sound out of breath, mate.
Don't have a heart attack on me.

51:27.125 --> 51:29.101
You're worried about
them young pups taking your place.

51:29.125 --> 51:30.125
Mm.

51:30.916 --> 51:32.625
You got ten seconds to catch me up.

51:37.250 --> 51:38.708
Mm.

51:45.375 --> 51:46.625
Harder than it looks, innit?

51:53.333 --> 51:54.666
So, what's this job, then?

51:55.416 --> 51:59.666
Oh. Jojo's missus is dead impressed.

51:59.750 --> 52:01.833
I ain't heard the end of her
walk-in shower.

52:02.875 --> 52:03.916
Here it is.

52:04.333 --> 52:06.541
You have to use your finger
otherwise it doesn't...

52:06.625 --> 52:08.833
- Yeah, I have got one.
- That's one of the new ones.

52:13.833 --> 52:15.250
Need some water, man.

52:15.416 --> 52:18.000
Oh, yeah, I'll put some tonic in.

52:22.958 --> 52:24.666
- Tonic, man.
- Oh, come on.

52:24.750 --> 52:28.125
Stop fannying about. This is what
I'm on about. What do you reckon?

52:28.208 --> 52:30.500
- It's nice.
- See?

52:31.166 --> 52:34.541
That's the terrace.
South-facing, gets the sun all day.

52:34.666 --> 52:36.458
Right on the Med. Decent views.

52:36.541 --> 52:40.166
- All right, what do you want then?
- Uh, whole thing, really.

52:40.250 --> 52:41.666
Do you do that?

52:41.750 --> 52:44.291
Well, I can, but, you know,
I'm a plumber.

52:44.375 --> 52:46.250
I mean, you'd want to find someone local.

52:46.458 --> 52:48.583
- Where is it again?
- Greece.

52:48.666 --> 52:51.875
Yeah, okay, Greece. Yeah, you find a...
There's a find-a-builder thing in Greece,

52:51.958 --> 52:53.517
like, you got to look on forums.
Go online.

52:53.541 --> 52:57.625
Yeah. I thought it might be nice to do
some work in the sun, be nice for you.

52:57.958 --> 52:59.500
Nice? It'll be like an oven, mate.

52:59.583 --> 53:01.142
Well, you can use it
while you're out there.

53:01.166 --> 53:04.833
Have some mates out.
Think of the parties. I'd visit.

53:08.541 --> 53:12.166
- Could have emailed this.
- Well, it ain't as friendly, though.

53:16.291 --> 53:17.458
What you laughing at?

53:18.416 --> 53:21.666
That room in Romania.
Do you remember?

53:23.500 --> 53:24.625
What made you think of that?

53:25.791 --> 53:27.875
Last time I saw you, pretty much.

53:29.500 --> 53:30.916
That was a mad night, wasn't it?

53:32.333 --> 53:33.958
Was it? No.

53:35.416 --> 53:38.750
Don't be a dick. There's only 100 bottles
of this. I got the last case.

53:38.833 --> 53:41.333
- No, honestly.
- We had that game the next day.

53:41.625 --> 53:43.000
Uh, the one I scored in.

53:43.208 --> 53:44.333
Thanks for reminding me.

53:45.041 --> 53:46.666
God, a lot's changed since then.

53:47.500 --> 53:51.416
Married. Divorced. Two kids.

53:53.708 --> 53:55.583
Jojo mentioned
you were seeing someone.

53:57.750 --> 53:58.833
Gary.

54:02.750 --> 54:05.000
So, what's he like?

54:05.833 --> 54:08.250
- He's all right.
- All right?

54:08.666 --> 54:09.833
Yeah, he's good to me.

54:12.416 --> 54:13.625
Do you live together?

54:13.875 --> 54:16.250
No. I mean, well,
we like our own space, you know?

54:16.333 --> 54:18.666
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, it's nothing funny.

54:18.750 --> 54:20.833
It's just, uh... just the way it is.

54:21.875 --> 54:24.375
Do your teammates know about him
from down the Marshes?

54:24.625 --> 54:28.458
Yeah, they're cool with it. I mean,
there's some banter, but nothing.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.125
Does he go down the pub after
the game? Beers with the lads?

54:33.500 --> 54:34.625
Yeah, sometimes.

54:36.208 --> 54:40.500
Do you hold hands?
In the pub, I mean.

54:42.583 --> 54:43.750
Depends what pub.

54:46.458 --> 54:47.458
Yeah.

54:51.708 --> 54:54.291
- Mind if I, uh...
- Yeah, do us one while you're at it.

54:55.333 --> 54:58.625
- All right. What about you, man?
- Hmm?

54:58.750 --> 55:00.500
- You seeing anyone?
- Uh...

55:03.125 --> 55:05.208
It's hard to meet people.

55:05.708 --> 55:07.588
You've got about
a million followers on Twitter!

55:10.125 --> 55:12.833
Real people, you know?

55:14.500 --> 55:17.416
- You been LA?
- Mm-mm.

55:19.041 --> 55:22.250
They have these parties
that are exclusively

55:22.333 --> 55:26.083
- for famous people and billionaires.
- Serious?

55:26.166 --> 55:28.206
You have to check
your phone in at the door.

55:29.583 --> 55:30.958
You been America?

55:32.041 --> 55:33.958
- Never got round to it.
- Wha...

55:35.208 --> 55:36.416
Well, you should.

55:37.375 --> 55:38.750
It's got everything.

55:39.250 --> 55:42.500
Midwest, I adore the Midwest.

55:42.583 --> 55:45.458
You can drive for ten hours
and not see a fucking soul.

55:45.541 --> 55:47.791
Where else does that happen, eh?

55:47.875 --> 55:51.916
There's nothing, just silence.

55:53.125 --> 55:54.791
Can hear your own heartbeat.

56:07.083 --> 56:10.833
About that night, uh...
I just want to clear the air,

56:10.916 --> 56:13.375
'cause it's the kind of thing,
if you don't talk about it,

56:13.458 --> 56:15.708
you put too much weight on it,
you know?

56:15.791 --> 56:18.958
"Oh, this thing happened
when we were kids."

56:19.041 --> 56:21.458
- Right.
- Turn it into something it's not.

56:22.916 --> 56:25.083
I mean, when I got your text, I...

56:25.166 --> 56:27.958
Yeah, I mean, you could get
all psychological on it, but...

56:28.375 --> 56:32.000
It was just shits
and giggles, weren't it?

56:36.833 --> 56:37.833
Doughnut.

56:43.250 --> 56:44.250
Uh.

56:44.541 --> 56:46.059
It's getting late, man, I should, uh...

56:46.083 --> 56:49.250
Uh, no, you...
You just got here.

56:49.333 --> 56:51.000
Yeah. I got work tomorrow.

56:51.083 --> 56:54.083
Nah. No, no, no. We should do
something. What's up with you?

56:54.166 --> 56:56.500
- Like what?
- Well, mark the occasion.

56:56.583 --> 56:58.263
- What, it's been eight, nine years?
- Ten.

56:58.291 --> 57:00.142
Yeah, when was the last time
you had a proper blowout

57:00.166 --> 57:01.875
like the old days? Come on! No.

57:01.958 --> 57:05.875
Tomorrow's another day.
Tonight's me and you, mate. Go on!

57:06.791 --> 57:08.583
Let yourself off the leash.

57:13.750 --> 57:16.833
You're staying. You know you are.

57:16.916 --> 57:18.958
- You know you are.
- All right.

57:19.041 --> 57:20.750
What you got in mind?

57:26.250 --> 57:27.958
Eh?

57:28.041 --> 57:31.125
Watch yourself.
No, watch yourself, watch yourself.

57:34.250 --> 57:35.850
Shall we throw the telly out the window?

57:36.708 --> 57:38.500
Go on, then.

57:38.958 --> 57:40.838
Right, you get that end,
I'll get the other end.

57:45.416 --> 57:48.041
Yep. One, two, three.

57:48.666 --> 57:51.458
Oh, mate.
We're going to need a screwdriver.

57:51.541 --> 57:53.221
I'll ring down
and get 'em to bring one up.

57:53.541 --> 57:55.250
What, "Can I borrow a screwdriver?"

57:55.875 --> 57:57.795
I ain't going to tell 'em why. Am I?

57:57.875 --> 57:59.833
- What?
- No, imagine if you did.

57:59.916 --> 58:01.583
- What, tell 'em? Shall I?
- Yeah.

58:01.666 --> 58:02.809
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Shall I do it?

58:02.833 --> 58:06.416
Shall I do it? I'm going to do it.
I would like a screwdriver.

58:07.208 --> 58:09.250
Oh, no, uh, the tool.

58:09.541 --> 58:11.458
Yeah, I need to get the telly
off the wall.

58:11.541 --> 58:13.625
Sweet.

58:17.958 --> 58:20.333
Ah!

58:21.041 --> 58:24.166
Good to see you, mate. Life has not
been the same without you!

58:24.250 --> 58:26.416
Here we go, here we go.

58:26.916 --> 58:28.000
Come on!

58:31.916 --> 58:34.333
All right, mate, all right,
all right, chill!

58:37.416 --> 58:38.416
Jesus!

58:40.750 --> 58:43.583
You know what? It's a shame
you didn't do your badges.

58:43.666 --> 58:44.976
You could've gone into management.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.708
You'd have been good at that.

58:47.875 --> 58:50.875
Yeah, well, apparently people don't
like to take orders from a black man.

58:53.208 --> 58:55.250
I got a lot of respect for you, Ade.

58:56.875 --> 59:00.125
- Respect?
- Working man like yourself.

59:01.583 --> 59:03.041
What's that got to do with anything?

59:04.583 --> 59:08.000
No, I'm just saying, you are a grafter.

59:08.583 --> 59:09.666
A grafter?

59:11.250 --> 59:14.500
- Why are you being all...
- What does it mean? You respect me.

59:15.708 --> 59:18.083
- It means I respect you.
- Yeah, but why keep saying it?

59:18.166 --> 59:21.125
- You said it twice now.
- 'Cause you're making me repeat myself.

59:21.208 --> 59:23.708
All this, "Be nice
for you to work in the sun."

59:23.791 --> 59:24.951
- What does that mean?
- Uh...

59:26.375 --> 59:29.041
- Ade, we were having a laugh.
- No, no, what's it all about?

59:29.125 --> 59:31.166
Ade!

59:31.541 --> 59:32.625
I ain't making this up.

59:32.708 --> 59:34.601
Ade, why you so sad?

59:34.625 --> 59:36.559
Don't do that fucking voice, yeah?
I don't like it.

59:36.583 --> 59:38.666
Are you pulling that card on me?

59:38.750 --> 59:40.916
Just don't. I don't like it.
We ain't kids no more.

59:41.000 --> 59:41.916
Oh!

59:42.000 --> 59:44.375
Talk about a sense of humour
breakdown.

59:44.458 --> 59:45.791
Don't fucking get me started.

59:45.875 --> 59:48.000
Jesus, Ade, what is it
you can't handle here? Huh?

59:48.083 --> 59:50.208
The booze, the pills, or the failure?
Which one is it?

59:50.333 --> 59:52.333
No, no! I'm just curious. Come on.

59:53.208 --> 59:56.541
God, I'm sorry things didn't pan out,
but it ain't my fault.

59:56.958 --> 59:58.158
That's what you think this is.

59:58.291 --> 59:59.583
Oh, what, what?

59:59.666 --> 01:00:03.166
You'd rather be fixing toilets
than doing what I do?

01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:06.083
What, cooped up here like a nutter
going for midnight swims?

01:00:06.166 --> 01:00:09.541
- Yes, I would.
- Bullshit. You're jealous.

01:00:09.625 --> 01:00:12.541
Jase, no one gets to do the thing
they dreamt about when they was a kid.

01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:17.500
- That's life, mate.
- Except I do, Ade. I do.

01:00:17.583 --> 01:00:19.184
Of course I'd rather be
playing professional.

01:00:19.208 --> 01:00:20.500
- Of course I...
- Thank you!

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:22.383
You're acting like you made
some killer point.

01:00:22.458 --> 01:00:24.833
- I'm a grown man. I moved on.
- Mm-hmm...

01:00:24.916 --> 01:00:26.583
so, why are you here, then?

01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:28.500
- 'Cause you asked me here.
- Oh!

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:30.333
Things must be going
really well for you.

01:00:30.416 --> 01:00:33.208
Drop everything,
drive 200 miles like that.

01:00:34.666 --> 01:00:35.866
Where does Gary think you are?

01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:38.250
Away on business?

01:00:38.416 --> 01:00:40.096
I am on business.
You asked me for a quote.

01:00:40.166 --> 01:00:43.041
You just wanted a taste,
didn't you, hmm?

01:00:43.125 --> 01:00:45.916
See how the other half lives,
recapture the old glory.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.958
Feel a part of something, is that it?

01:00:48.208 --> 01:00:49.583
- Think what you want.
- Oh...

01:00:49.666 --> 01:00:52.833
Do you tell your teammates
you played with me, hmm?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
You do, don't you?

01:00:55.083 --> 01:00:56.333
I bet they love it.

01:00:56.708 --> 01:00:59.791
I bet they buy you drinks.
I bet you tell 'em all the stories,

01:00:59.875 --> 01:01:02.875
how you used to be someone,
how you were this close,

01:01:02.958 --> 01:01:05.416
but it never happened
because you didn't get the luck.

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:08.250
- That's right, I didn't get the luck.
- You reckon?

01:01:08.375 --> 01:01:09.809
I was the better player
and you know it.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.226
That's right, Ade.
You were the better player.

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.458
- Thank you.
- Still, you managed to fuck it up.

01:01:13.791 --> 01:01:16.583
But that's you all over.
Not enough bottle, not enough heart.

01:01:16.666 --> 01:01:18.458
I didn't bottle it.
I never had the chance.

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:21.059
- You had your chance. You didn't take it.
- You never passed me the ball.

01:01:21.083 --> 01:01:23.267
- Well, I didn't need to Ade. I scored.
- I was in the better position.

01:01:23.291 --> 01:01:24.976
No, the better position's
the one you score from.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.333
That was the position I was in.

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:28.767
- You said you'd pass me the ball.
- Well, it's not the playground.

01:01:28.791 --> 01:01:30.392
It don't work like that
in the big boys' game.

01:01:30.416 --> 01:01:33.250
No, that was my only chance.
I was subbed off after that.

01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:36.458
No, you were subbed off
because two minutes later,

01:01:36.541 --> 01:01:38.916
you gave the ball away
in our half and they scored.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.208
I was taking the man on.

01:01:40.666 --> 01:01:42.791
Nine times out of ten,
I'd have skinned him.

01:01:43.375 --> 01:01:44.666
I did it every time in training.

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:46.625
We're all George Best
in the back garden.

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:52.333
All right.

01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:54.750
I made a bad choice.

01:01:56.333 --> 01:01:57.875
My mind wasn't in the right place.

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:01.916
Why wasn't your mind in the right place?

01:02:02.416 --> 01:02:03.416
You know why.

01:02:05.916 --> 01:02:09.250
But we discussed this.
I thought it was nothing.

01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:13.601
You keep telling yourself that
all you want,

01:02:13.625 --> 01:02:15.305
but we both know
what went on in that room.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.250
What? A hand-job?

01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:24.708
The hand-job I gave you
when we were kids?

01:02:26.166 --> 01:02:28.583
You're harping on about
a wank you had ten years ago?

01:02:28.666 --> 01:02:32.500
Ade, I'm sorry if you got confused.

01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:34.375
Confused?
You're the one who got confused.

01:02:37.166 --> 01:02:38.916
All right.

01:02:40.166 --> 01:02:42.125
Okay, I tell you why I did what I did.

01:02:42.208 --> 01:02:43.875
I did it to get in your head,

01:02:44.166 --> 01:02:47.166
throw you off balance, make sure
you weren't right for the game.

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:49.458
- Bullshit.
- I didn't have your pace

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:54.458
or your first touch,
but what I did have... was this.

01:02:55.541 --> 01:02:56.750
I've always had it.

01:02:57.333 --> 01:03:01.416
It's an instinct to know what needs
to be done and then do it.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.041
That... is all.

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:08.666
It wasn't the hand-job
I got confused about.

01:03:08.833 --> 01:03:10.208
Jesus fucking...

01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:12.708
What was it, then?

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:17.435
It was the way you held me all night...

01:03:19.166 --> 01:03:20.291
Kissed me...

01:03:21.916 --> 01:03:23.291
Told me you loved me.

01:03:25.666 --> 01:03:28.458
Next morning, I got on the coach.
I waited for you.

01:03:30.041 --> 01:03:32.250
When you stepped on,
I looked up and I smiled at you.

01:03:32.916 --> 01:03:35.000
You just walked by.
You didn't even look.

01:03:37.166 --> 01:03:39.517
Afterwards, I tried talking to you,
but you were with the other lads

01:03:39.541 --> 01:03:40.941
being a big man, 'cause you scored.

01:03:42.583 --> 01:03:45.375
Next week, squad list goes up,
my name's not there, yours is.

01:03:46.625 --> 01:03:48.000
They don't renew my contract.

01:03:49.583 --> 01:03:52.625
Jase, I texted you, I left voicemails.
Nothing.

01:03:54.083 --> 01:03:55.166
How could you do that?

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:58.083
After everything that passed between us.

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:10.041
I can't remember every detail,
to be completely honest, Ade.

01:04:10.125 --> 01:04:12.333
- Is that right?
- A lot has changed since then.

01:04:12.458 --> 01:04:16.375
I have had other things
to worry about the last ten years.

01:04:16.458 --> 01:04:18.375
Then why did you invite me here, Jase?

01:04:18.916 --> 01:04:20.791
If you've got so many
other things going on?

01:04:21.666 --> 01:04:23.250
Just to see if you'd come back.

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:26.750
Back where?

01:04:28.416 --> 01:04:30.833
To this room.

01:04:33.125 --> 01:04:36.041
- I never been here before.
- What you talking about?

01:04:36.541 --> 01:04:39.125
- You just said "come back".
- So?

01:04:39.541 --> 01:04:42.708
- This is the first time I've been here.
- I know.

01:04:43.458 --> 01:04:45.658
So what do you mean,
you wanted to see if I'd come back?

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:48.541
- Just to see if you'd come back...
- Back to what?

01:04:48.625 --> 01:04:49.666
To me!

01:04:59.208 --> 01:05:01.208
Jase... Jase?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.400
Jase, you can't just leave it there.
What'd you mean by that?

01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:08.333
Hey.

01:05:10.958 --> 01:05:13.333
This young man's brought
our screwdriver.

01:05:18.375 --> 01:05:20.666
So, what do you want with this?

01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:25.291
We thought we might chuck
the telly out the window.

01:05:25.458 --> 01:05:29.166
It's proper bolted on, mate.
Seriously. You got no chance.

01:05:29.666 --> 01:05:31.833
- You won't tell anyone, will you?
- What's it worth?

01:05:31.916 --> 01:05:32.916
Jason...

01:05:35.041 --> 01:05:36.517
We're in the middle of something here.

01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:38.583
- Yeah, I'd say. What's your name?
- Harry.

01:05:38.666 --> 01:05:41.500
I'd say Harry was in the middle
of something, wouldn't you?

01:05:42.333 --> 01:05:44.750
It's a pleasure to meet you, Harry.

01:05:44.833 --> 01:05:47.625
Oh, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Jason.

01:05:48.333 --> 01:05:49.333
This is Ade.

01:05:50.416 --> 01:05:52.041
Say hello to Ade, Harry.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.250
You all right, Ade? Hello.

01:05:55.708 --> 01:05:56.916
Ade's shy.

01:05:57.583 --> 01:05:58.625
Oi.

01:05:59.375 --> 01:06:01.875
- Oh!
- Jase, he's at work.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:04.083
It's all right.
I clocked off ten minutes ago.

01:06:04.333 --> 01:06:08.041
Ah! Just take four,
see how you get on.

01:06:08.125 --> 01:06:10.892
I'll have double, I reckon. By the looks
of things, I'm playing catch-up.

01:06:10.916 --> 01:06:13.416
Ooh! Good man!

01:06:18.583 --> 01:06:22.083
So, hang on, if you've clocked off,

01:06:22.958 --> 01:06:24.166
how come you're still here?

01:06:24.583 --> 01:06:27.958
- I'm always looking for the party, me.
- Oh! Do you hear that, Ade?

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:29.791
Harry loves to party.

01:06:30.333 --> 01:06:32.041
Jase, we're talking about something here.

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:35.125
Ade, we're having a laugh.

01:06:37.041 --> 01:06:39.333
Here, will you take a piccie for us?

01:06:40.333 --> 01:06:41.933
Oh, you won't put that online, will you?

01:06:41.958 --> 01:06:44.250
Of course not.

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:48.708
Come on, Ade,
don't be a spoilsport.

01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:51.416
Oh... Cor...

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.000
It's all right. I'll do a selfie.

01:06:53.083 --> 01:06:55.125
Fucking hell.

01:06:56.583 --> 01:06:57.875
Ooh.

01:06:57.958 --> 01:06:59.041
Yeah, one more.

01:07:04.208 --> 01:07:05.291
What you laughing at?

01:07:05.666 --> 01:07:10.333
When I was younger, that video of you
and that lap dancer was a bit of a staple.

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:13.791
I put it on once when
I was shagging my girlfriend.

01:07:13.916 --> 01:07:17.750
I took a selfie of me and her
watching you.

01:07:17.958 --> 01:07:19.666
Sent it to all my mates.

01:07:20.083 --> 01:07:21.583
We broke up soon after that.

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:23.916
I hate girls
who haven't got a sense of humour.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.250
Oh! It's important.

01:07:27.333 --> 01:07:28.750
- Yeah!
- Mm.

01:07:30.791 --> 01:07:31.833
Is that real?

01:07:32.375 --> 01:07:34.875
Mm-hmm. You want it?

01:07:36.416 --> 01:07:37.416
Really?

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:39.291
Mmm.

01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:41.875
Oh!

01:07:45.916 --> 01:07:49.416
Am I the most famous person
you've ever met?

01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:54.250
Er, yeah?

01:07:54.333 --> 01:07:56.125
Fuck.

01:07:56.583 --> 01:08:00.041
Though I once met Jimmy Savile.

01:08:00.333 --> 01:08:01.791
He'd come to my school.

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:04.010
They wouldn't invite him now,
I don't reckon.

01:08:04.958 --> 01:08:07.416
- He's dead.
- Yeah, and that.

01:08:09.791 --> 01:08:12.000
He's funny, isn't he?

01:08:15.166 --> 01:08:17.416
You... You're funny.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.000
- Am I?
- Yeah.

01:08:19.416 --> 01:08:21.041
Yeah, I am actually.

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:24.291
What do you think
we should do with Harry, Ade?

01:08:24.707 --> 01:08:26.832
Well, I'm up for anything, really.

01:08:26.916 --> 01:08:29.041
I mean, my mates say
I've got no boundaries.

01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:31.541
I'm one of those people
that can just drink and drink.

01:08:31.625 --> 01:08:34.125
I don't get drunk.
I don't even get hangovers.

01:08:34.207 --> 01:08:37.457
All right, you've had your fun.
It's time Harry left, Jase.

01:08:37.832 --> 01:08:40.457
- Either he's off or I'm out.
- What do you think, Harry?

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:43.166
It's your room, innit?

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:46.041
- I'm not messing around.
- I don't care either way.

01:08:46.125 --> 01:08:47.666
Just make a decision.

01:08:50.957 --> 01:08:55.166
Oh. Well, it wouldn't be
the first time you lost your nerve.

01:08:56.707 --> 01:08:57.707
What was that?

01:08:58.875 --> 01:09:01.875
Hmm? Don't think
I don't know what you're doing.

01:09:03.082 --> 01:09:04.166
What am I doing?

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:07.791
Ade, what am I doing, hmm?

01:09:07.875 --> 01:09:09.515
What am I doing?
What the fuck am I doing?

01:09:09.582 --> 01:09:11.541
I don't know what I'm doing.
What am I doing?

01:09:11.625 --> 01:09:12.957
Huh? What am I doing, huh?

01:09:13.041 --> 01:09:15.457
Aha! What am I doing, Harry?

01:09:15.541 --> 01:09:18.582
I don't know!
What am I doing?

01:09:18.666 --> 01:09:20.017
What, you think this is too much for me?

01:09:20.041 --> 01:09:23.332
- Oh, what am I doing? What am I doing?
- You think I'm afraid of this?

01:09:23.416 --> 01:09:25.500
What am I doing, mate?
What the fuck am I doing?

01:09:25.582 --> 01:09:27.416
- Ade! Ade!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:09:34.875 --> 01:09:36.832
All right.

01:09:38.582 --> 01:09:39.750
Let's do this.

01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:46.416
Why don't we...

01:09:48.041 --> 01:09:49.125
play a game?

01:09:49.207 --> 01:09:50.309
What's the game?

01:09:50.332 --> 01:09:54.125
Ooh. All in good time, Harry.

01:09:54.207 --> 01:09:55.750
All in good time.

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:58.041
This is bonkers.

01:09:58.166 --> 01:10:01.000
Reminds me of this stag do
I went on in Krakow, right?

01:10:01.083 --> 01:10:04.083
White water rafting in the morning,
Auschwitz in the afternoon,

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:07.625
back to the hotel for a shower,
quick bite to eat, then on to a sex club.

01:10:07.708 --> 01:10:11.666
- Here.
- Mmm, mmm. Cheers.

01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:15.666
And the best man, he got this prossie.
Now, she sits the groom down on a chair

01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:18.291
and does this full on strip show
down to her knickers,

01:10:18.375 --> 01:10:21.125
whipped cream on her tits
and that and then, I'm not lying...

01:10:21.541 --> 01:10:25.750
She unzips him,
sprays some of the cream on his cock

01:10:25.833 --> 01:10:28.750
and starts noshing him off
like she's not had a hot dinner in weeks.

01:10:28.875 --> 01:10:30.875
His dad's there, his uncle,

01:10:30.958 --> 01:10:33.833
father of the bride, and we're all, like,

01:10:33.958 --> 01:10:35.666
shouting things. This is the best bit.

01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:39.583
Just as the groom's about to pop,
and you can tell he's getting close,

01:10:39.666 --> 01:10:41.476
'cause his eyes are going
like he's having an epic.

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:42.416
Oh, yeah.

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.666
This prossie shoves her hands
into her pants, reaches back,

01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:49.625
and flops out the biggest cock
you've ever seen.

01:10:49.708 --> 01:10:51.541
It's a fucking lady boy.

01:10:51.625 --> 01:10:54.708
We were like,
"Where the fuck you stashing that?"

01:10:54.791 --> 01:10:57.041
'Cause she had this tiny little thong on.

01:10:57.125 --> 01:11:00.416
Oh, and the fucking groom's face, though.

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.791
- Oh? Oh, yeah?
- He cried, actually. It went a bit dark.

01:11:04.125 --> 01:11:07.833
So what's the game, then?

01:11:08.541 --> 01:11:09.875
Forfeit or dare.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.851
- What's the forfeit?
- You drink from the bucket.

01:11:11.875 --> 01:11:14.392
I ask you to do something,
you don't wanna do it, you have to drink.

01:11:14.416 --> 01:11:15.500
All right, then.

01:11:17.875 --> 01:11:18.958
Take off your shirt.

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.333
Oh.

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:30.541
And your trousers.

01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:38.625
- Oh. Hey. Hold on to me.
- Oh. Oh!

01:11:40.416 --> 01:11:43.458
That was easy.

01:11:43.541 --> 01:11:47.083
Mmm. Go on, Ade.

01:11:47.666 --> 01:11:49.041
Do you see anything you fancy?

01:11:50.833 --> 01:11:53.708
- Is it... Is it his turn now?
- Yeah.

01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:00.500
Let's have a go with this bucket, then.

01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:01.583
Okay.

01:12:03.833 --> 01:12:05.500
Oh.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.291
Go on, one more.

01:12:10.375 --> 01:12:11.375
Yeah?

01:12:19.333 --> 01:12:20.458
Jase.

01:12:28.166 --> 01:12:30.000
Fucking hell,
you boys play hard.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.041
- You all right, Harry?
- Yeah.

01:12:33.125 --> 01:12:36.666
For a moment there,
I thought you'd lost the plot a bit.

01:12:36.916 --> 01:12:39.916
Everything went dark and then
there was this bright light and,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.250
well, it was like what my Aunt Ida said
happened when she had a heart attack

01:12:43.333 --> 01:12:46.666
and woke up and saw Jesus
stood next to fucking Elton John.

01:12:49.458 --> 01:12:52.958
Right, I did it. I got a belter!
This is for you.

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:57.583
I dare you to kiss him with tongues.

01:12:57.875 --> 01:13:00.041
Boom!

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:05.875
Yeah.

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:08.333
Yeah, why not?

01:13:11.541 --> 01:13:16.416
Now, don't do anything
you're not comfortable with, Ade.

01:13:23.333 --> 01:13:24.708
Look at you.

01:13:26.125 --> 01:13:27.958
All serious.

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:50.500
I got a better idea.

01:13:51.291 --> 01:13:52.291
What is it?

01:13:52.916 --> 01:13:55.916
- Why don't you kiss Ade?
- What? It's not my turn.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.458
It doesn't matter.
I think he likes you.

01:13:58.916 --> 01:14:00.208
- Does he?
- Yeah.

01:14:00.458 --> 01:14:02.000
- Fucking hell.
- Go on.

01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:04.750
I never kissed a fella before.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.375
Are you sure he wants to?
He's got a right face on him.

01:14:09.458 --> 01:14:11.000
I don't think Ade knows what he wants.

01:14:12.208 --> 01:14:13.541
Or maybe he does.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.750
- Now, get the fuck out.
- What?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.208
- I said get the fuck out!
- Get the fuck off me, you homo.

01:14:38.291 --> 01:14:40.375
- I'll go when he says to go.
- He's right.

01:14:41.791 --> 01:14:42.791
Fuck off.

01:14:44.333 --> 01:14:45.375
Party's over.

01:14:47.666 --> 01:14:49.791
You were fun for five minutes.
I'm bored now.

01:14:51.083 --> 01:14:53.541
You fucking pair of shit hounds.

01:14:53.625 --> 01:14:55.541
What am I, the warm-up?

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:59.291
You know, no wonder
you're a shit footballer these days.

01:14:59.708 --> 01:15:03.000
Every time you get one-on-one
with the goalkeeper, you can't work out

01:15:03.083 --> 01:15:06.416
whether to put the ball in the net,
or his dick in your mouth.

01:15:08.291 --> 01:15:12.041
Yeah, laugh it up, you queer bastard!

01:15:12.916 --> 01:15:17.750
It's about as funny as another man
putting your kids to bed.

01:15:19.375 --> 01:15:22.541
- Ow! Don't! Fucking weirdo!
- Come here.

01:15:23.125 --> 01:15:26.000
- Come here. Get up. Get up, get up.
- No, no, no.

01:15:26.083 --> 01:15:28.000
- No!
- Get in! Get in!

01:15:28.166 --> 01:15:30.708
Jase!

01:15:30.958 --> 01:15:34.500
- Good boy, good boy. Good doggie.
- Jase!

01:15:35.458 --> 01:15:39.416
Ah! Fucking psycho faggot!

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.250
You think we don't know
what goes on in here?

01:15:42.458 --> 01:15:45.708
Lads up and down the stairs all hours.
You think we don't know?

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:48.375
Oh, tell your friends, Harry,
get some free drinks.

01:15:48.458 --> 01:15:52.000
Yeah, this is going on Twitter, mate.
See how you like that.

01:15:52.083 --> 01:15:55.291
Harry, son, I got people for that.
This goes on Twitter,

01:15:55.375 --> 01:15:58.416
I'll own your house and your nan's house,

01:15:59.833 --> 01:16:03.750
and your children's house,
if you ever get that far in life.

01:16:03.833 --> 01:16:07.375
Now, off you trot, son.
There's grown-ups talking.

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:30.583
Do you reckon he was showing off?

01:16:33.166 --> 01:16:34.458
I don't think you're well.

01:16:35.166 --> 01:16:39.000
No? I'm tip-top, mate.
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:16:41.291 --> 01:16:42.541
What am I here for?

01:16:43.708 --> 01:16:45.583
Truth be told,

01:16:47.416 --> 01:16:49.541
I was thinking of retraining as a plumber.

01:16:50.166 --> 01:16:51.916
Thought you could give me some tips.

01:16:56.208 --> 01:16:58.500
That's good, Jase. That's very good.

01:16:58.583 --> 01:16:59.583
The villa...

01:17:03.833 --> 01:17:05.500
Phew. I want you to have it.

01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:12.583
It's yours.

01:17:15.416 --> 01:17:19.250
You could live there.
I could visit.

01:17:21.208 --> 01:17:23.048
- We could look at the view.
- Are you serious?

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:26.791
My, um...

01:17:30.208 --> 01:17:32.666
My knee's chalk.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:38.291
Ever seen a mountain crumble,
fall into the sea?

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:40.583
Could go any time.

01:17:41.916 --> 01:17:43.750
Now that you need me,
you want me to stay?

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:54.208
You're the last thing I remember...

01:17:55.291 --> 01:17:58.375
of any... value.

01:18:04.541 --> 01:18:06.458
When I got your text, Jase,

01:18:09.041 --> 01:18:10.458
I had some notion...

01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:22.791
I can't.

01:18:25.083 --> 01:18:26.208
I'm sorry.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.083
I just can't.

01:18:36.291 --> 01:18:38.541
Well, it was only a suggestion.

01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:40.635
I don't know why you're making
a thing of it.

01:18:53.333 --> 01:18:55.013
Do you know what I feel
when I look at you?

01:18:55.708 --> 01:18:56.833
Is it pity?

01:18:59.041 --> 01:19:00.559
You mean you got the moral high ground,

01:19:00.583 --> 01:19:03.500
because you fix
people's toilets for a living?

01:19:06.375 --> 01:19:09.750
I scored at the San Siro.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.958
Eighty thousand people
rose to their feet.

01:19:16.208 --> 01:19:20.166
I inspire love, devotion.

01:19:21.416 --> 01:19:22.625
What do you get, Ade?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Invoices?

01:19:27.541 --> 01:19:29.083
I love someone and he loves me.

01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:32.083
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:19:33.291 --> 01:19:36.250
The great love affair with Gary.

01:19:37.333 --> 01:19:39.250
Don't tell me it doesn't eat away at you.

01:19:39.625 --> 01:19:41.458
What if? What if? What if?

01:19:43.541 --> 01:19:45.666
Look me in the eyes
and tell me there aren't moments

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:50.291
when you wouldn't give everything
to live the way I do.

01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:55.416
Just what I thought.

01:19:57.166 --> 01:19:59.666
You haven't the nerve
to live like I do, Ade.

01:20:00.625 --> 01:20:03.500
It would scare the shit out of you.

01:20:06.875 --> 01:20:09.791
Do you want to know why
I never returned your calls?

01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:17.625
It's because I didn't want
to be infected by your failure.

01:20:18.583 --> 01:20:20.833
- Well, at least I live in the real world.
- Oh!

01:20:21.916 --> 01:20:25.125
I live in the same world you do, mate.

01:20:27.083 --> 01:20:29.416
Just better parts of it.

01:20:35.666 --> 01:20:37.541
You must be very happy, then.

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:47.875
Please.

01:20:49.833 --> 01:20:51.208
Please, Ade...

01:20:53.666 --> 01:20:55.208
I don't know what to do!

01:20:58.666 --> 01:21:00.708
Did you really do it
to get into my head, Jase?

01:21:08.666 --> 01:21:09.958
I don't know.

01:21:42.541 --> 01:21:44.208
Fuck.

01:21:45.305 --> 01:21:51.173
