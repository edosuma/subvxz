00:11.020 --> 00:15.550
Tonight, Jaguar supercharged XKR versus its twin sister.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.220
Why do roadworks take so long?

00:18.220 --> 00:20.420
Come on! Put it back into it, you, man.

00:21.100 --> 00:25.420
And Jamie Oliver prepares a delicious lap in our reasonably-priced car.

00:34.420 --> 00:38.070
Hello, hello and yes!

00:39.300 --> 00:41.900
We'll also be showing you...

00:41.900 --> 00:47.970
We'll also be showing you a very small man having a very big car accident.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.320
But,

00:50.500 --> 00:54.350
even we with our limited knowledge of television realize

00:54.350 --> 00:56.250
that you don't do that now,

00:56.250 --> 00:58.150
you have to do that later on in the show,

00:58.150 --> 00:59.900
otherwise everyone would just watch it now

00:59.900 --> 01:02.000
and turn over to watch the final of Big Brother.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
So what we're actually doing about that is

01:04.000 --> 01:05.970
saving you from yourselves, really.

01:05.970 --> 01:07.270
Yeah, we are. That's one problem solved.

01:07.270 --> 01:08.500
But we do have another one of course,

01:08.500 --> 01:11.000
because all the time that we've been off air,

01:11.000 --> 01:12.700
people have been coming up to me and Jeremy,

01:12.700 --> 01:13.920
and they've been saying

01:13.920 --> 01:16.300
will Top Gear go back to the way it was?

01:16.300 --> 01:19.950
Is it still just gonna be three normal blokes cocking about and arguing?

01:19.950 --> 01:21.650
I mean it's actually a problem really,

01:21.650 --> 01:23.100
because obviously one of us blokes

01:23.100 --> 01:25.000
has now become Princess Diana.

01:29.270 --> 01:30.500
It's tricky.

01:30.820 --> 01:32.000
No, he really has.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.400
However, Princess Diana himself has said quite explicitly

01:36.400 --> 01:38.370
that he just wants to come back onto a show

01:38.370 --> 01:40.420
that is the way it was back in the summer.

01:40.420 --> 01:42.720
Exactly. He said please don't make any changes, please.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.620
Yeah, he actually said explicitly

01:44.620 --> 01:47.150
"for pete's sake, don't make a big fuss."

01:47.150 --> 01:49.650
Absolutely. So it gives me really great pleasure

01:49.650 --> 01:51.850
'cause I didn't think I'd ever be saying this at one point.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.570
Ladies and gentlemen, would you please welcome

01:53.570 --> 01:55.550
Richard Hammond!

02:05.170 --> 02:08.120
Oh, well, this is a pretty awkward.

02:09.449 --> 02:10.669
Thank you, I said

02:10.669 --> 02:12.020
no fuss, no fu...

02:12.020 --> 02:14.870
Oh, sorry gals, sorry, sorry,

02:14.870 --> 02:19.970
sorry gals, sorry

02:19.970 --> 02:21.870
I said no fuss.

02:21.870 --> 02:23.770
Mate!

02:23.770 --> 02:25.970
Hammond!

02:25.970 --> 02:28.250
- Oh man!
- I'll be great to have you back!

02:28.250 --> 02:29.850
James May!

02:33.370 --> 02:38.050
Oh, that's embarrassing, really is embarrassing.

02:38.050 --> 02:41.100
That's em, that whole stairs thing,

02:41.100 --> 02:44.570
That was the most embarrassing thing I've ever had to do.

02:44.570 --> 02:46.120
Well I wouldn't say that to any of the people

02:46.120 --> 02:48.850
who just had to jump off a Boeing 737 at Luton

02:48.850 --> 02:52.020
We were gonna get some like / ones, do you know the big ones?

02:52.020 --> 02:54.120
Do you know how much they were to gonna be to build?

02:54.120 --> 02:55.300
300 quid.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.270
Oh, fair enough.

02:56.270 --> 02:58.270
I mean we like it, OK? We are glad you're back.

02:58.270 --> 03:00.220
But 300 quid to build a gate?

03:00.220 --> 03:01.400
So no, the aeroplane stair.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.470
I wish you hadn't bothered, thank you.

03:02.470 --> 03:04.600
Anyway, listen. This is the big question, I guess,

03:04.600 --> 03:06.120
everybody wants to know.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.550
Here ready?

03:07.550 --> 03:09.500
Are you now a mental?

03:09.500 --> 03:10.570
No.

03:11.770 --> 03:12.770
I'm not.

03:12.770 --> 03:14.050
I'm fixed.

03:14.050 --> 03:16.570
I'm completely fixed and normal and healed. Thank you.

03:16.570 --> 03:17.520
What are you doing?

03:17.520 --> 03:20.400
Well you know it's a,
it's a tissue for if you start dribbling.

03:22.250 --> 03:24.200
That's all I've had for four months.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.200
What? Tissues?

03:25.200 --> 03:27.720
No, people hanging around just watching,

03:27.720 --> 03:30.270
waiting for my eyes to point in different directions and me to go bonkers.

03:30.270 --> 03:31.520
I'm fixed. I'm normal.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.400
Are you the same person that you were before?

03:34.400 --> 03:36.120
Yeah, I mean the doctors were worried

03:36.120 --> 03:38.570
because it's brain damage, about, you know, personality change or whatever

03:38.570 --> 03:42.670
But, no, the only difference really between me now and me before the crash,

03:42.670 --> 03:45.100
is I like celery now and I didn't.

03:46.350 --> 03:48.450
So you're still shouty, you're still fighty?

03:48.450 --> 03:49.070
Yes.

03:49.070 --> 03:50.100
And if I take you to the pub

03:50.100 --> 03:52.570
are you still gonna want to punch me in the face after 15 minutes?

03:52.570 --> 03:53.950
Yes, though that's to be honest,

03:53.950 --> 03:55.820
more your personality than mine.

03:55.820 --> 03:58.620
- You see, I always want to punch him in the face after 15 minutes
- Yeah, that's perfectly normal.

03:58.621 --> 03:59.620
...sometimes less

03:59.620 --> 04:02.370
OK, look, the most important thing I think

04:02.370 --> 04:06.350
really is to make sure this never happens again, the crash.

04:06.350 --> 04:08.950
'cause I mean that you're like the cat from "Shrek II" here.

04:08.950 --> 04:11.570
You have used up 8 of your 9 lives really.

04:11.570 --> 04:13.420
So I've decided that in future,

04:13.420 --> 04:16.899
all the very fast cars, the Lambos, the Astons, the Ferraris,

04:16.899 --> 04:19.100
I'll look after them, I'll...

04:19.100 --> 04:19.870
You'll drive them?

04:19.870 --> 04:20.570
Yeah, I'll drive them.

04:20.570 --> 04:22.000
No personality change for you either.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.050
Then it's business as usual.

04:23.050 --> 04:26.450
Absolutely, I'm still the same kind thoughtful soul that I always was.

04:26.450 --> 04:27.570
That's quite moving.

04:27.570 --> 04:29.050
- OK, brilliant.
- Thank you.

04:29.050 --> 04:31.270
Thank you for that and thank you as well for

04:31.270 --> 04:33.370
the embarrassing stairs thing, that's great.

04:33.370 --> 04:35.250
There is one more thank you please if you don't mind,

04:35.250 --> 04:36.470
difference here is perhaps,

04:36.470 --> 04:37.970
I mean this one.

04:37.970 --> 04:41.200
I'd like to say thank you to all of the nurses,

04:41.200 --> 04:43.470
and the doctors and all the staff in Leeds and in Bristol

04:43.470 --> 04:45.250
where I was when I was being stuck back together,

04:45.250 --> 04:48.320
and the people, Yorkshire air ambulance, who got me there in time,

04:48.320 --> 04:50.570
and particularly, and particularly right now,

04:50.570 --> 04:52.170
to everybody who wrote in.

04:52.170 --> 04:54.250
Some of the people here maybe, and you perhaps

04:54.250 --> 04:55.950
that wrote in just to wish me the best.

04:55.950 --> 04:58.400
It really meant a lot and helped and thank you for that.

05:00.570 --> 05:01.750
Hey, bravo!

05:01.750 --> 05:02.950
The stairs are nice

05:02.950 --> 05:05.150
You're eyebrows aren't burnt
and what?

05:05.150 --> 05:06.100
You eyebrows

05:06.100 --> 05:07.020
Oh they are fixed

05:07.020 --> 05:08.270
they can't be broken.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.300
Shall we resume normal service?

05:12.300 --> 05:14.450
Absolutely, err, good idea,

05:14.450 --> 05:16.450
because I've got a bit of bean in my bonnet.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.600
- See what I mean?
- Yeah.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.470
Listen, the thing is, roadworks.

05:19.470 --> 05:20.850
For the last year or so,

05:20.850 --> 05:23.300
I have been virtually cut off from London

05:23.300 --> 05:26.000
because they've been digging up the Oxford ring road, OK?

05:26.000 --> 05:29.070
At one point, they had it down to a single lane,

05:29.070 --> 05:30.400
and you had to go down that,

05:30.400 --> 05:35.550
being escorted by a van with yellow flashing lights on the roof at 10 mph.

05:35.550 --> 05:38.150
It'd be better off and quicker on a horse.

05:38.570 --> 05:41.850
Then they said it was something you going this slowly to protect the work force

05:41.850 --> 05:44.020
but there wasn't a work force there.

05:44.020 --> 05:45.470
They were never doing anything

05:45.470 --> 05:49.220
'cause they were in a hut having a health and safty lecture.

05:49.220 --> 05:51.200
He is absolutely right.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.420
These days with roadworks,

05:52.420 --> 05:54.650
you never get that sense that they are getting on with it,

05:54.650 --> 05:56.370
doing it quickly and efficiently

05:56.370 --> 05:58.850
for the benefit of those people who might be inconvenienced.

05:58.850 --> 06:00.900
Who pay their wages exactly.

06:00.900 --> 06:02.200
I mean it's really simple.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.000
Close the road,

06:03.000 --> 06:04.450
slap some new tarmac on it,

06:04.450 --> 06:06.700
tell the health and safety people to get stuffed

06:06.700 --> 06:09.670
and get the damn thing open as quickly as possible.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.670
I mean how hard can it be?

06:11.670 --> 06:14.620
Oh, how I've missed the pang of dread I feel

06:14.620 --> 06:15.820
whenever you mentioned the words

06:15.820 --> 06:17.570
how hard can it be?

06:17.570 --> 06:19.770
Well, we are just about to find out.

06:21.870 --> 06:25.400
This is the critically important D5481

06:25.400 --> 06:29.150
just outside the village of Bidford-on-Avon in Warwickshire.

06:31.050 --> 06:34.670
The surface looks like a lunar teenager's face.

06:34.670 --> 06:37.920
And the council said repairing the 1.5 miles stretch

06:37.920 --> 06:41.670
would mean closing it completely for one working week.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.970
A massive inconvenience for the people of Bidford.

06:48.270 --> 06:50.350
But we've taken the job over

06:50.350 --> 06:53.700
and by being efficient, and hard working and organized,

06:53.700 --> 06:57.650
we're gonna try and get the job done in 24 hours.

06:57.650 --> 06:58.370
Are we ready?

06:58.370 --> 06:59.000
Oh yeah.

06:59.000 --> 06:59.920
Let's go!

07:01.770 --> 07:04.220
Immediately though, there was a problem.

07:04.920 --> 07:09.020
I just wanna go through the barriers, the safety aspects before we start work.

07:09.020 --> 07:12.050
First of which is the protective equipment you're gonna have to use.

07:12.050 --> 07:15.450
You all must have your boots, your trousers, jackets and your hat on.

07:15.450 --> 07:16.720
We don't have time for this.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.550
/ would go in backwards as well forwards

07:19.550 --> 07:23.070
So anyone walking beyond the plant must have a chaperone with them,

07:23.071 --> 07:27.360
Just beware the rabbit holes please, don't want any broken ankles or sprained ankles

07:27.370 --> 07:29.850
6 days of this and 1 day of work.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.250
telling you which piece of PPE(Personal Protective Equipment) you must wear

07:32.250 --> 07:33.550
Let's just get out of the way.

07:33.550 --> 07:35.550
everybody general PPE, any questions?

07:35.550 --> 07:36.970
Can we start now?

07:36.970 --> 07:39.000
not until you're suited and booted, I'm afraid

07:39.000 --> 07:40.100
well, we're dressed

07:40.100 --> 07:41.550
Can't see my genitals.

07:42.500 --> 07:46.520
The safety lecture droned on for so long that we really had to get cracking,

07:46.520 --> 07:50.050
if we were to begin as planned on the dot of 9 a.m.

07:52.070 --> 07:53.870
Now it's a 1.5 miles stretch.

07:53.870 --> 07:58.550
And we're gonna dig it up, repave it, roll it, paint new white lines, the lot.

07:58.550 --> 08:00.950
Yeah, and because the road is actually gonna be closed,

08:00.950 --> 08:02.570
we have to have a diversion set up.

08:02.570 --> 08:04.820
And that's what James is doing right now.

08:04.820 --> 08:06.200
Right, this is really very simple.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.950
Here is our road, here,

08:07.950 --> 08:10.600
and obviously that's closed 'cause that's where we're working on.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.120
So anybody wanted to go down there to Ardens Grafton

08:13.120 --> 08:15.300
would have to go round the block.

08:15.300 --> 08:19.970
So I'm gonna put a sign up that takes them towards Stratford down there,

08:19.970 --> 08:22.900
and then somewhere I'll take them back around

08:22.900 --> 08:25.670
back around there and they'll be back around at Ardens.

08:25.670 --> 08:27.300
at the other end of this road.

08:27.300 --> 08:28.470
Easy.

08:35.100 --> 08:38.400
Normally for a job like this, they'd use 14 men.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.500
We were using 32.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.919
And to pat them up,

08:41.919 --> 08:45.800
I prepared a stowing motivational speech.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.550
the Parthenon, the pyramids,

08:48.970 --> 08:51.020
the Great Wall of China,

08:51.020 --> 08:52.777
Each a shining...

08:54.630 --> 08:58.050
each a shining beacon of ambition.

08:58.050 --> 09:03.550
And today gentlemen, the D5481 will join that list.

09:09.300 --> 09:12.600
We shall build this road in a day!

09:12.600 --> 09:18.770
Our resurfacing work will last for 1,000 years!

09:18.770 --> 09:21.850
Sadly, Jeremy's speech went on a bit.

09:21.850 --> 09:23.800
But nevertheless,

09:24.450 --> 09:26.850
on the dot of 9:07,

09:29.250 --> 09:30.700
we began.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.600
The first job was to rip up the old surface

09:34.600 --> 09:36.700
and for that, we needed a plainer.

09:36.700 --> 09:40.170
To operate it safely, you're supposed to use three men

09:40.170 --> 09:44.450
but we put two on other jobs and decided to go it alone.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.520
You're gonna drive that.

09:46.520 --> 09:46.970
Yes.

09:46.970 --> 09:48.220
Teeth dig up the road,

09:48.220 --> 09:50.750
rubble goes up there and into the truck.

09:50.750 --> 09:51.500
Exactly right.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.550
Which...

09:52.550 --> 09:53.920
Well, you can drive it.

09:57.450 --> 10:01.670
James' diversion meanwhile, hadn't got off to a good start.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.400
Hey?

10:08.370 --> 10:09.950
Oh, cock.

10:10.650 --> 10:12.020
Yeah, all right.

10:12.700 --> 10:14.770
Well, I finally upped the cutters.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.820
all the revs

10:17.550 --> 10:20.920
Here we go, hand brake, off.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.470
Engine.

10:30.620 --> 10:33.950
OK, let's go, yeah.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.400
Jeremy, catch up, man, what are you doing.

10:39.400 --> 10:43.420
Just look behind you and see if it's going in the bloody lorry.

10:43.420 --> 10:45.150
Ignore the sign.

10:46.670 --> 10:48.370
Ignore the sign, it's wrong.

10:48.370 --> 10:50.000
James was being rubbish,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.320
but then we were hardly employees of the month either.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.170
Stupid idiot!

10:55.170 --> 10:56.450
look, stop putting me off

10:56.450 --> 10:58.070
You've missed the truck.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.720
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.350
And then things got worse.

11:03.350 --> 11:05.620
Jeremy, there is a slight problem.

11:05.620 --> 11:06.520
What?

11:06.520 --> 11:09.500
I've sort of set off with a bit of angle,

11:09.500 --> 11:12.420
and I'm on the wrong bit of road.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.250
- This is Bidford, isn't it? - Yeah.

11:17.250 --> 11:20.170
If you wanted to get back to there,

11:20.170 --> 11:22.500
but without using that road,

11:22.500 --> 11:23.770
which is the best way to go?

11:23.770 --> 11:25.470
Err, up to the island,

11:25.470 --> 11:27.150
- Up there?
- Yeah.

11:27.150 --> 11:29.150
third turn in after the island.

11:29.650 --> 11:32.670
What's happened is it goes in the bit of a straight line,

11:32.670 --> 11:33.200
Yeah.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.350
and then when you tried to turn it back in, it stalled.

11:35.350 --> 11:36.920
So I'm trying to get it back to the...

11:36.920 --> 11:38.350
Give it more power.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.570
There is a Clarkson answer to a problem

11:40.570 --> 11:42.100
Just more power.

11:42.270 --> 11:45.770
So far, in forty minutes, we've done...

11:45.770 --> 11:46.720
- 20 yards?

11:46.720 --> 11:47.570
- 20 yards.

11:47.570 --> 11:48.900
And you think this is helping?

11:50.170 --> 11:53.600
Right, left, industrial estate...

11:57.320 --> 12:00.320
I'm quite pleased with the way this is going now.

12:01.370 --> 12:02.970
You've just hit me again!

12:03.700 --> 12:07.020
I feel as though we are working as a team well.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.000
Jeremy, we've got to stop.

12:10.170 --> 12:11.070
What for?

12:11.070 --> 12:13.500
Because the truck is full and overflowing

12:13.500 --> 12:15.420
and it might not be able to tip it out

12:15.420 --> 12:17.900
which means we'll have to do it with shovels, you pillock.

12:18.620 --> 12:21.670
To save time, I simply parked the lorry at the side of the road

12:21.670 --> 12:23.300
and emptied it there.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.500
Empty!

12:25.670 --> 12:28.500
This didn't seem to go down well with my colleagues.

12:28.870 --> 12:30.070
That's a gate.

12:32.150 --> 12:33.170
Whose gate?

12:33.170 --> 12:35.950
I... Does it matter? It's a gate, it's somebody's gate.

12:35.950 --> 12:38.550
and you put several tons of road in it.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.300
And I won't... I can't do a 3 point turn now either, can I?

12:42.320 --> 12:44.950
No, you can't. That's the only turning place.

12:46.350 --> 12:47.820
You're on your own, man. I'm sorry.

12:47.820 --> 12:48.650
Can you get a digger?

12:48.650 --> 12:49.370
No!

12:49.370 --> 12:53.000
So it goes left, right, left,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.670
industrial estate, right.

12:55.670 --> 12:57.420
Yeah, pass the industrial estate

12:57.420 --> 12:59.250
There's only a mini round about.

12:59.250 --> 13:00.570
<i>Turn right up Georges Elm Lane.</i>

13:00.570 --> 13:02.970
<i>Georges Elm Lane, which is the first on the right.</i>

13:02.970 --> 13:04.450
Pass industrial estate.

13:09.420 --> 13:12.250
At this stage, things were going quite badly.

13:12.250 --> 13:15.970
So we handed the lorry and the plainer over to the professionals.

13:15.970 --> 13:19.350
Richard was then given the simple job of tidying up,

13:19.350 --> 13:23.170
and I went back to making motivational speeches.

13:23.670 --> 13:26.320
This is not the end,

13:26.320 --> 13:28.820
this is not the beginning,

13:28.820 --> 13:32.250
this is not the beginning of the end,

13:32.250 --> 13:33.550
it's not even...

13:33.550 --> 13:35.520
With the men motivated nicely,

13:35.520 --> 13:37.270
we soon have the old surface cleared

13:37.270 --> 13:41.300
and then started to lay the bitumen which glues the new tarmac in place.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.150
Some people then began to ask if they could have a break.

13:45.150 --> 13:47.400
But of course the answer was no.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.250
This is how we're managing to speed things up.

13:51.850 --> 13:55.720
Lunch on this job is what you can find in the hedge.

13:56.650 --> 14:01.270
Dickensian work practices alone though, would not get this job done in a day.

14:01.270 --> 14:03.850
You also need to throw resources at it.

14:03.850 --> 14:07.170
something councils seem unwilling to do.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.170
I really wanna get these math worked out

14:11.170 --> 14:13.320
because the way we're doing this,

14:13.320 --> 14:15.700
throwing men and machines at it and doing it in a day

14:15.700 --> 14:17.970
is 7,000 pounds more expensive

14:17.970 --> 14:21.070
than having 8-hour days, and taking a week.

14:22.350 --> 14:23.900
But I reckon,

14:24.650 --> 14:29.120
you only need inconvenience 500 people for an hour a day,

14:30.450 --> 14:32.870
for you to be better off doing it our way.

14:36.020 --> 14:39.520
At 1 o'clock, James finally finished his diversion

14:39.520 --> 14:41.670
giving locals lots of alternatives

14:41.670 --> 14:44.800
and returned to find me having a power nap.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.750
Work sets you free.

14:47.320 --> 14:51.420
Refreshed, I came up with yet more ways to speed things up.

14:52.170 --> 14:54.250
You know when the trucks back up,

14:54.250 --> 14:55.250
Yeah.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.100
There's a man walking behind them.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.150
The banksman, yeah.

14:58.150 --> 15:00.650
But all trucks've got to have cameras on them as well.

15:00.650 --> 15:01.770
They do as well.

15:01.770 --> 15:04.200
So why do you need a man and a camera?

15:04.200 --> 15:07.100
That man could be better employed making roadworks.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.600
It's double protection, isn't it?

15:08.600 --> 15:10.450
- If somebody...
- It's not. It's just... what?

15:10.450 --> 15:11.520
Well, did you hear though,

15:11.520 --> 15:15.270
in fairness, one bloke recently got run over by that plaining machine.

15:15.270 --> 15:16.920
How interest am I in that?

15:16.920 --> 15:17.950
They only found his hand.

15:17.950 --> 15:18.770
Don't care.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.500
By 2:30, the road had been sprayed with bitumen glue

15:24.500 --> 15:27.300
and was ready to receive the new layer of tarmac.

15:28.450 --> 15:32.500
This is the most critical part of our whole operation.

15:32.970 --> 15:38.770
Normally, they would reckon on laying between 250 and 270 tons of tarmac in a day.

15:38.770 --> 15:41.170
Now we're gonna try and lay, how much is it?

15:41.170 --> 15:42.920
Eleven hundred tons.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.350
One thousand and one hundred tons in a day.

15:45.670 --> 15:48.170
That's why we've got Hammond up at tarmac's

15:48.170 --> 15:50.420
kind of quarry plant thing, up near town

15:50.420 --> 15:53.250
to make sure the supplies keep coming.

15:55.720 --> 15:58.720
The modern quarry is full of heavy part,

15:58.720 --> 16:02.020
but actually it is all controlled by a computer.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.670
Oh, mother of....

16:06.670 --> 16:10.220
We've got / mixer and a pump

16:10.220 --> 16:11.300
OK, stay calm.

16:11.300 --> 16:14.470
I can do e-mails, I can do this lot, em.

16:14.470 --> 16:15.920
Plainly he mastered it,

16:15.920 --> 16:18.720
because soon the trucks began to arrive.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.770
But unfortunately, the paving machine that lays the tarmac

16:21.770 --> 16:25.270
was being driven by the slowest person in the world.

16:27.020 --> 16:27.920
Wait, James.

16:27.920 --> 16:28.970
What?

16:28.970 --> 16:32.050
If a job is worth doing, it's worth doing quickly.

16:32.050 --> 16:33.950
No, well.

16:33.950 --> 16:34.820
Quickly.

16:34.820 --> 16:35.320
Well.

16:35.320 --> 16:35.670
Quickly.

16:35.670 --> 16:36.050
Well.

16:36.050 --> 16:36.450
Quickly.

16:36.450 --> 16:36.850
Well.

16:36.850 --> 16:39.770
Still, overall, things were moving along nicely.

16:39.770 --> 16:42.050
Men of the D5481

16:42.050 --> 16:45.850
things are looking good, I'm seeing machines moving about now.

16:49.250 --> 16:50.520
Yeah, yes.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.520
Err, now we're gonna pick up that later on

16:53.520 --> 16:57.870
when obviously everything starts to go wrong.

16:57.870 --> 16:59.220
Um now though,

16:59.220 --> 17:03.100
now it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.

17:03.100 --> 17:06.349
Now, since our guest tonight first came on the show,

17:06.349 --> 17:08.770
he launched a campaign to improve school dinners

17:08.770 --> 17:10.099
and has become really a saint

17:10.099 --> 17:13.069
he now wields more political power than a president,

17:13.069 --> 17:17.020
he glides through Hollywood parties like a film star,

17:17.020 --> 17:20.550
interestingly though, he still talks like he's eating a pillow.

17:21.250 --> 17:24.270
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jamie Oliver.

17:25.849 --> 17:27.000
Hello there.

17:28.650 --> 17:29.400
Hello.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.520
Have a seat,

17:34.920 --> 17:36.200
it's nice of you to come back.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.420
thank you very much.

17:37.820 --> 17:38.720
very good.

17:39.370 --> 17:42.770
this uh...this school dinner thing really has propelled you along.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.770
you were just like "another chef",

17:44.770 --> 17:47.270
and now you're national hero, a God, I tell you.

17:47.270 --> 17:48.250
I take offence to that.

17:48.250 --> 17:50.550
I was never just another chef, was I, guys?

17:51.450 --> 17:52.220
there is a... I mean you could...

17:52.220 --> 17:53.070
was I, guys?

17:54.900 --> 17:55.670
anyway Gordon,

17:55.670 --> 17:56.420
um...

17:58.300 --> 17:59.870
it didn't go down well in Rotherham?

18:00.300 --> 18:04.670
Rotherham? oh with those old birds putting the old err the Mac and cheese through the railings

18:04.670 --> 18:06.820
Yeah, they were feeding their... what were they feeding their kids with? BigMacs?

18:06.820 --> 18:09.870
That's right, coz we... they... they changed... the regulations came in,

18:09.870 --> 18:11.050
they changed all the junk,

18:11.050 --> 18:16.050
err and basically some moms started selling the junk food through the railings

18:16.050 --> 18:17.600
but I was in Australia when I saw it,

18:17.600 --> 18:18.600
it was on BBC world news,

18:18.600 --> 18:20.100
and I just woke up literally,

18:20.320 --> 18:23.900
and all I can see is like hundreds of hands coming through bars,

18:23.900 --> 18:27.270
and these old...big old scrubbers poking stuff through there,

18:27.270 --> 18:29.370
taking all their money and um...

18:29.370 --> 18:31.420
I used to work in Rotherham...please

18:31.620 --> 18:32.470
thing is, I¡¯m abso...

18:32.470 --> 18:34.550
are you...you're absolutely convinced this is for real,

18:34.550 --> 18:36.620
this "we've all got to eat more healthily",

18:36.620 --> 18:40.050
I just think getting fat is actually evolution,

18:40.750 --> 18:44.970
I am evolving into a more civilized being by being fatter.

18:44.970 --> 18:45.850
yes.

18:45.850 --> 18:48.300
which actually brings me onto an important point, dieting

18:48.300 --> 18:48.870
yes.

18:48.870 --> 18:51.320
- I've got a diet, impossible. - OK.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.820
well what are you eating for crying...

18:52.820 --> 18:54.420
Food, well now I mean when I diet,

18:54.420 --> 18:56.400
I eat carrots and diet coke.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.020
right

18:57.020 --> 18:57.900
and that's it.

18:58.420 --> 18:59.750
and it works, I lose weight,

18:59.750 --> 19:01.170
but I faint all the time.

19:02.070 --> 19:02.920
you faint all the time?

19:02.920 --> 19:04.350
I do faint coz the problem I got Jamie,

19:04.350 --> 19:06.450
genuinely, I walk into a supermarket

19:06.450 --> 19:07.020
yes?

19:07.020 --> 19:09.600
and you look at food and think: what's fattening and what isn't

19:09.600 --> 19:12.000
Uh, well I think you know... you can try and simplify it,

19:12.000 --> 19:15.270
uh for instance, if you cook, um... you know Jeremy,

19:15.270 --> 19:18.570
that's a lot healthier than buying sort of pre-packed food

19:18.570 --> 19:20.220
also if you like chili,

19:20.220 --> 19:23.720
chili speeds up your metabolism by 25%,

19:23.720 --> 19:25.550
uh and also you can get high on it,

19:25.550 --> 19:26.470
which is great, and it's legal,

19:26.470 --> 19:29.250
go raving, nice.

19:29.250 --> 19:31.120
I¡¯m all over chili, mate.

19:31.120 --> 19:33.470
So if I put chili in my diet coke?

19:35.050 --> 19:36.420
I grew a load of chili this year,

19:36.420 --> 19:39.400
and I grew the hottest in the world and I¡¯m telling ya, hoho.

19:40.720 --> 19:41.520
coz there is another thing,

19:41.520 --> 19:43.320
you do grow quite a lot of your organic...

19:43.320 --> 19:45.400
- yeah, the last 3 years, yeah.
- what?

19:45.400 --> 19:47.600
- about 5% of the stuff to 15 - it's impossible

19:47.600 --> 19:48.570
it's not impossible

19:48.570 --> 19:49.450
yes it is.

19:49.450 --> 19:53.320
Li...listen, if I, I¡¯ve never grown anything until 3 years ago,

19:53.320 --> 19:56.200
like like...it...uh, the first year, I didn't know what I was doing,

19:56.200 --> 19:58.020
just by putting seeds in mud,

19:58.020 --> 20:00.270
you'd amazed, 80% of the stuff grows into something,

20:00.270 --> 20:02.900
you have to be a complete idiot to not grow anything

20:04.100 --> 20:06.800
I planted a field of barley last year

20:06.800 --> 20:07.450
Barley?

20:07.450 --> 20:08.100
Barley

20:08.100 --> 20:10.000
What are you planting barley for?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.220
- If you really want to know, it was to attract a certain type of bird, - grow potatoes and beans

20:13.220 --> 20:15.650
which I like, I...I¡¯m a RSPB member,

20:15.650 --> 20:16.570
don't mention that to...

20:16.570 --> 20:18.300
please don't say that.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.270
- and I want to... a bit...
- are you a twitcher?

20:20.270 --> 20:21.450
shhh, please,

20:21.450 --> 20:22.770
the thing is, I grew this but I thought:

20:22.770 --> 20:25.100
I won't put any fertilizer on it coz that'll poison the birds,

20:25.100 --> 20:27.400
it grew to this long and was bright grey,

20:27.400 --> 20:29.420
it's costed me a fortune

20:29.420 --> 20:32.750
and I just think fertilizer works, fertilizer is good

20:32.750 --> 20:33.950
- no no
- it is.

20:33.950 --> 20:35.200
Don't spray the ground

20:35.200 --> 20:35.770
Why?

20:35.770 --> 20:38.250
Coz it just wrecks all the microbes and their organisms

20:38.250 --> 20:39.050
and the stuff that goes on

20:39.050 --> 20:41.200
on and a lot of it are versions of poisons,

20:41.200 --> 20:41.970
you just don't know what you...

20:41.970 --> 20:44.170
Yes, but who knows? there was something I bought the other day,

20:44.170 --> 20:45.100
it was organic,

20:45.100 --> 20:46.770
do you know what it had been fertilized with?

20:46.770 --> 20:47.400
Crap

20:47.400 --> 20:51.120
- yes, human excrement from Mexicans
- Not human, it's illegal

20:51.120 --> 20:53.720
- it is, Mexicans can crap on your food, and then they...
- no.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.400
It's organic,

20:55.400 --> 20:57.450
- they're all out in the fields,
- no.

20:57.671 --> 21:01.150
With some subras and ponchos on, defecating on your bananas

21:01.150 --> 21:01.800
Can I just say,

21:01.800 --> 21:03.720
if your introduction into growing stuff

21:03.720 --> 21:05.820
and all the wonderful things that makes you feel good about,

21:05.820 --> 21:08.820
if your introduction is barley, no wonder you're miserable.

21:09.850 --> 21:11.100
it is complicated though,

21:11.100 --> 21:12.970
eating well is complicated.

21:12.970 --> 21:14.720
I mean my donkey died the other day,

21:14.720 --> 21:16.500
do I eat it?

21:16.900 --> 21:18.520
Have you ever eaten a donkey?

21:19.970 --> 21:21.320
It was Jeffery, man.

21:21.320 --> 21:22.450
you can't...

21:22.720 --> 21:24.800
- I know you could make sausage
- a little bit of rosemary, a bit of time,

21:24.800 --> 21:26.520
A bit of garlic, tenderize it,

21:26.520 --> 21:29.600
you know, 170 for about 6 hours, it will be lovely.

21:30.820 --> 21:32.500
especially the tail.

21:33.870 --> 21:35.250
can we talk about cars?

21:35.250 --> 21:36.900
yes, let's talk about cars.

21:37.150 --> 21:39.550
You came down here obviously primarily, I know

21:39.550 --> 21:40.420
I wanted to beat Gordon,

21:40.420 --> 21:41.500
let's be honest about it, make...

21:41.500 --> 21:42.920
Coz Gordon is at the top

21:42.920 --> 21:45.200
And he got a really good speed as well,

21:45.200 --> 21:46.350
which was 46.3,

21:46.350 --> 21:48.170
um last time I came on the show,

21:48.170 --> 21:49.170
it was just after Gordon,

21:49.170 --> 21:51.050
and we both got 1:50 in the old moaner

21:51.050 --> 21:52.320
in the old car, exactly.

21:52.320 --> 21:55.000
And I kinda maintain pride by at least joining him,

21:55.000 --> 21:56.870
I was so geared up this week

21:56.870 --> 21:59.950
You were, he actually said, can I come down early to practice

21:59.950 --> 22:01.320
coz I really wanna beat Gordon.

22:01.320 --> 22:01.900
Yeah.

22:01.900 --> 22:05.200
And this was the scene that greeted him when he got here, early.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.120
There it is,

22:08.120 --> 22:09.100
there are the cars,

22:09.100 --> 22:11.000
ready for you to go out in them.

22:11.500 --> 22:14.050
We did wait for the snow to fall,

22:14.050 --> 22:15.470
and you went out, ok?

22:15.470 --> 22:16.600
who'd like to see...

22:16.600 --> 22:18.650
well I think we just got one bit of practice here,

22:18.650 --> 22:19.450
would you like to see that?

22:19.450 --> 22:20.320
[crowd]Yeah.

22:20.320 --> 22:23.370
Let's play the tape of Jamie having a bit of bash here,

22:23.370 --> 22:24.420
oh coming up...where are we?

22:24.420 --> 22:26.120
bound to be the second to last corner,

22:26.450 --> 22:29.900
catches everybody out and yes it is, nice line through...

22:29.900 --> 22:32.700
oh no, that's wrong

22:33.270 --> 22:37.200
oh no no no oh

22:40.320 --> 22:41.920
Bring out the new car.

22:45.870 --> 22:48.950
And that was , that was the end of that car then

22:48.950 --> 22:51.500
yeah, I, I actually... I... it was, I think

22:51.500 --> 22:52.070
totaled it

22:52.070 --> 22:54.700
I think the wheel, broken radiator and suspension, so

22:54.700 --> 22:55.400
No worries

22:55.400 --> 22:57.270
- we'll have it fixed for next week, - sorry.

22:57.270 --> 23:00.020
after that, ok? after that,

23:00.020 --> 23:01.420
you were ready to do your lap

23:01.420 --> 23:02.270
yes

23:02.270 --> 23:03.520
ok? Gordon to beat,

23:03.520 --> 23:06.520
- which is what?1:46...
- I never, I just doubt it so much

23:06.520 --> 23:07.870
Who'd like to see his lap?

23:07.870 --> 23:09.050
[crowd]yes

23:09.050 --> 23:10.600
Here we go, let's have a look.

23:12.520 --> 23:14.220
Well, it looks like you've been off in this one as well

23:14.220 --> 23:15.120
yes, I had

23:16.520 --> 23:18.870
here we go, looking keen,

23:19.300 --> 23:21.400
how is the old car? compared to the old old one?

23:21.400 --> 23:23.450
it's a little bit faster on the faster bits

23:23.450 --> 23:25.200
- it is. - but it's still a hair dryer

23:26.720 --> 23:28.200
that's a nice line through that

23:28.200 --> 23:28.920
thank you Jeremy.

23:28.920 --> 23:29.850
I am very brilliant

23:30.020 --> 23:32.420
Oh you...though you say so yourself,

23:32.420 --> 23:34.550
around Chicago, here we go again,

23:34.550 --> 23:35.450
looking good

23:36.670 --> 23:37.900
this power cuts out,

23:38.120 --> 23:39.720
this is a piece of crap, this car.

23:41.300 --> 23:43.200
then you'll find that's called a rev-limiter,

23:43.200 --> 23:44.450
most cars have it,

23:44.800 --> 23:46.420
- oh, a bit of understeer there - Look at that lean

23:46.420 --> 23:50.420
- you are towing around most of Surrey underneath there
- That's so tight though, isn't it?

23:50.950 --> 23:52.270
That was... actually that was very good,

23:52.270 --> 23:53.950
that was well rescued from the last understeer,

23:53.950 --> 23:55.170
did you lift here?

23:55.900 --> 23:56.400
You do...

23:56.870 --> 23:59.650
Do look like special needs sometimes Jamie, there,

23:59.650 --> 24:00.670
there we go...

24:01.300 --> 24:04.350
I actually spent most of my school years in special needs, Jeremy

24:04.350 --> 24:05.420
Yes, and there we are,

24:05.420 --> 24:07.520
so that's...oh that's a good one,

24:07.520 --> 24:10.070
and around the last one into Gambon,

24:10.070 --> 24:11.550
- you got into 2nd,
- go on go on go on...

24:11.750 --> 24:13.200
always a risk,

24:13.200 --> 24:16.250
but come on, come on, come on,

24:16.251 --> 24:19.101
nice one, nice one.

24:26.420 --> 24:28.400
now plainly and obviously,

24:29.570 --> 24:31.820
Gordon did have a sticky hot grippy day

24:31.820 --> 24:32.750
so you're not gonna beat him,

24:32.750 --> 24:34.920
so where do you think, bearing in mind...

24:34.920 --> 24:38.050
well if I can't Gordon then at least let me be right up his arse.

24:43.300 --> 24:44.950
I don't know what to say now,

24:44.950 --> 24:47.800
ok this is the fastest wet lap we've had,

24:47.800 --> 24:50.170
Philip Glenister 1:54.3 ,

24:50.170 --> 24:51.820
these are super hot laps

24:51.820 --> 24:53.500
excuse me, we're talking about wet laps,

24:53.500 --> 24:57.070
does everyone in the audience not think that snow has a di... slightly different context?

24:57.070 --> 24:59.470
- I'm sorry, I don't recall seeing snow there.
- Well...

24:59.470 --> 25:01.070
It wasn't snowing!

25:01.070 --> 25:02.750
It was wet.

25:02.750 --> 25:03.200
Ah...

25:03.200 --> 25:04.150
You're having a "wet"

25:04.150 --> 25:05.700
Put "w/s"

25:06.950 --> 25:08.020
Wet,

25:08.470 --> 25:09.400
and you did it...

25:09.400 --> 25:10.600
You've changed, Jeremy.

25:13.820 --> 25:15.700
Wet lap, 1 minute,

25:15.700 --> 25:16.900
Well that's sort of a relief.

25:17.300 --> 25:18.150
40,

25:19.400 --> 25:22.700
7 point 7 seconds

25:22.700 --> 25:23.650
Oh so close, oh so close

25:23.650 --> 25:26.470
The fast...that is an astonishing time,

25:28.500 --> 25:29.570
genuinely.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.920
We were absolutely staggered, the Stig...

25:41.900 --> 25:42.600
ah

25:45.170 --> 25:46.870
Melted snow,

25:48.370 --> 25:50.570
- which is water.
- That's pretty good, though, isn't it?

25:50.570 --> 25:51.670
It's better than pretty good,

25:51.670 --> 25:53.000
honestly and genuinely

25:53.000 --> 25:55.770
the Stig is just standing open...well we think he's open mouthed

25:55.770 --> 25:58.100
it's hard to say, just can't believe how good you were. It's...

25:58.100 --> 25:59.250
All credits to the Stig I say.

25:59.250 --> 26:00.920
No, all credits to you, all credits to the fact

26:00.920 --> 26:05.050
that somehow it seems that Britain's fastest people are chefs.

26:05.420 --> 26:07.020
-Come on!
- Heaven knows why.

26:07.020 --> 26:08.420
just to massage my ego,

26:08.420 --> 26:10.000
coz you know, our chefs are quite competitive,

26:10.000 --> 26:10.770
what I want to know

26:10.770 --> 26:15.700
is what does wet/melting snow... what... in seconds what does that give me back?

26:15.700 --> 26:17.170
I would say,

26:17.170 --> 26:18.820
and I¡¯m really sorry about this Gordon

26:18.820 --> 26:20.770
coz I know you're watching like this,

26:20.770 --> 26:22.150
four.

26:22.670 --> 26:23.870
(SING) Come on now!

26:32.800 --> 26:35.320
And then miraculously in the edit...

26:35.320 --> 26:37.200
Oh just, just for today,

26:37.200 --> 26:39.620
- just, just keep it there, just for today.
- I'll leave it up there just for today

26:39.620 --> 26:41.120
anyway, there you go, Jamie Oliver!

26:41.120 --> 26:42.150
Thank you.

26:48.703 --> 26:49.380
Now

26:50.083 --> 26:52.679
Now, this is a Jaguar XK8.

26:52.806 --> 26:54.880
We drove it on the last series and we loved it.

26:55.127 --> 26:57.803
But we always sort of knew that it was a support actor really

26:57.989 --> 27:00.241
a kind of warm-up man for the main event,

27:00.266 --> 27:02.569
the supercharged XKR,

27:02.687 --> 27:04.929
which I haven't been driving.

27:04.997 --> 27:07.387
Jeremy selflessly protected me from that one.

27:14.658 --> 27:15.623
This is it.

27:23.671 --> 27:25.364
It has big wheels

27:26.033 --> 27:27.176
vents in the bonnet

27:27.826 --> 27:30.171
brushed aluminum gills and a sort of

27:30.205 --> 27:32.677
stubbly Coulthardy chin

27:33.447 --> 27:39.017
So you can think of it as the standard car with cufflinks and a nice watch

27:43.286 --> 27:45.106
You've got to say, it looks good.

27:45.309 --> 27:48.424
In profile especially, it's just stunning.

27:54.174 --> 27:58.163
Sadly however I can't say the same for the interior.

27:59.831 --> 28:02.321
I'm sorry but this just doesn't feel

28:02.363 --> 28:05.617
like a 73,000 pound car. I mean...

28:05.677 --> 28:09.633
Mercedes give you seats that massage you as you drive along

28:09.633 --> 28:11.733
and BMW gives you i-Drive

28:12.054 --> 28:13.392
All I've got in here,

28:14.332 --> 28:15.839
a sort of five acres of

28:17.117 --> 28:18.082
tin-foil.

28:25.638 --> 28:29.719
The supercharged 4.2 litre V8 is a bit disappointing too.

28:29.736 --> 28:32.792
Because it's pretty much exactly the same as the

28:32.868 --> 28:37.473
supercharged 4.2 litre V8 they put in the old XKR.

28:40.384 --> 28:42.881
Merck gives us a new engine every five minutes.

28:43.101 --> 28:47.179
Audi designed a whole new V8 while I was just saying that.

28:47.552 --> 28:51.069
But Jag's been making this one for nearly ten years now.

28:51.355 --> 28:52.997
So come on, chop, chop!

28:54.665 --> 28:57.878
Yes it generates 420 BHP, but...

28:57.878 --> 29:01.959
Merck is now making engines with 520 BHP,

29:02.135 --> 29:04.691
and BMW isn't far behind.

29:06.089 --> 29:09.365
The only good thing is that the XKR is quite light.

29:09.365 --> 29:12.065
So while it doesn't have a shed-load of power, it's still¡­

29:13.284 --> 29:14.825
quite fast.

29:21.216 --> 29:24.797
You pass 60 miles an hour in 4.9 seconds.

29:25.085 --> 29:28.680
You pass 100 in 13 seconds, and that's good.

29:29.055 --> 29:33.381
But imagine how good it would be if it had more POWER!

29:41.100 --> 29:43.030
Now you might think at this point

29:43.089 --> 29:47.870
"Well there you go, it's a half-arse car made by a cash strapped company"

29:48.306 --> 29:51.354
"and that it is no match for its German rivals."

29:54.682 --> 29:56.863
Then you'd be wrong, because this car¡­

29:58.032 --> 29:59.386
is brilliant!

30:10.679 --> 30:12.679
The standard car sounds pretty good

30:12.696 --> 30:14.737
but this is deeper, ruder.

30:15.295 --> 30:17.631
Like Tom Jones gaggling in NASCAR.

30:18.613 --> 30:20.044
And then is the handling.

30:25.602 --> 30:29.132
It has got an absolutely fabulous chassis.

30:29.716 --> 30:34.660
It is the easiest car in the world to drive if you are lunatic.

30:35.142 --> 30:38.215
Honestly I know of nothing else that's this good for

30:38.723 --> 30:41.856
slithering about the smoke pouring off the back end.

30:44.455 --> 30:45.284
Look here we go.

30:45.775 --> 30:50.837
Sliding, still sliding, still sliding, no danger, still sliding.

30:51.494 --> 30:55.563
I mean that's doing power slides at like 110 mph, easily!

30:56.723 --> 30:57.699
This is just¡­

30:59.283 --> 31:02.643
makes a BMW or a Mercedes look like they're made of wood.

31:10.306 --> 31:12.769
And the great thing is that, when you take your

31:13.222 --> 31:15.626
looney-tunes hat off, and just settle down.

31:16.142 --> 31:18.798
It becomes all quite and comfortable.

31:19.712 --> 31:23.380
It really is Dr. Jimmy and Mr. Jim.

31:29.633 --> 31:30.265
Yes

31:30.561 --> 31:34.404
it has less power and fewer toys than its German rivals.

31:34.599 --> 31:37.468
And it's made with less satisfactory ingredients.

31:38.196 --> 31:42.241
But it is a damn sight cheaper and I'm sorry to keep hopping on about this,

31:42.701 --> 31:44.987
a damn sight better looking as well.

31:47.159 --> 31:50.029
I know that is a particularly horrible colour.

31:50.055 --> 31:52.154
But imagine it in silver or black.

31:53.026 --> 31:57.142
And then imagine walking away from it and buying a Mercedes or a BMW instead.

31:59.028 --> 32:00.179
I'm not sure I could.

32:02.457 --> 32:05.416
Ah. Yes you're thinking this is all very interesting.

32:05.638 --> 32:08.990
But what about the Jag's main rival, its sister,

32:10.524 --> 32:11.328
This.

32:16.293 --> 32:19.186
The Aston Martin V8 Vantage.

32:20.676 --> 32:22.632
It's even better looking than the Jag,

32:23.024 --> 32:24.337
and that's just the start.

32:26.314 --> 32:28.253
It's also even louder.

32:29.734 --> 32:31.736
It's harder too,

32:32.177 --> 32:33.573
much more aggressive,

32:35.141 --> 32:37.732
much more taut and angry.

32:45.621 --> 32:47.491
And it's an Aston Martin,

32:47.593 --> 32:51.336
which is a royal flush to the Jag's two pairs

33:01.738 --> 33:03.118
The thing is though, as you...

33:04.007 --> 33:07.258
stir away on the manual gearbox and you...

33:07.258 --> 33:10.367
ride the wave of noise

33:11.163 --> 33:15.152
feel the grip from these super sticky Pirelli tires,

33:16.439 --> 33:17.787
you realize,

33:19.214 --> 33:22.262
you ain't actually pulling away from the Jaguar.

33:26.358 --> 33:28.153
Feels like I'm going faster,

33:29.575 --> 33:31.708
sounds like I'm going faster,

33:33.548 --> 33:35.842
and my heart is certainly beating faster.

33:35.893 --> 33:41.198
But, my rear view mirror is still full of Jag.

33:58.801 --> 34:01.448
You must imagine that flat out in a straight line,

34:03.445 --> 34:06.896
the Aston will pull away 'cause the Jag's limited to 155,

34:06.896 --> 34:07.946
but haha¡­

34:09.498 --> 34:13.748
we tested one the other day and the Jag sailed up to 175.

34:16.203 --> 34:19.221
So, while the Aston is more exciting,

34:23.681 --> 34:25.592
the Jaguar is more powerful.

34:26.743 --> 34:30.205
It's also 12,500 ponds less expensive.

34:30.543 --> 34:31.643
It's more comfortable.

34:32.025 --> 34:36.571
It's better equipped with goodies like full leather and satellite navigation.

34:39.129 --> 34:41.356
And it's got two small seats in the back.

34:41.408 --> 34:44.244
So it's a bit more practical as well.

34:51.400 --> 34:55.920
Emotionally then, this car beats anything from Mercedes and BMW

34:56.344 --> 34:57.368
and on points

34:58.122 --> 34:59.948
it beats its sister as well.

35:00.951 --> 35:02.187
It is quite simply,

35:02.982 --> 35:04.362
spectacular!

35:08.701 --> 35:10.183
Yeah. And you know¡­

35:10.462 --> 35:12.697
That's what I was actually filming¡­

35:13.112 --> 35:16.071
I was actually making that film the day you crashed.

35:16.071 --> 35:18.509
Yeah, a much better day than I did though.

35:18.953 --> 35:20.240
Well, that's because I am a better driver.

35:20.714 --> 35:22.750
- Whatever.
- I just¡­ I just stayed on the gravel.

35:22.766 --> 35:25.171
Anyway, listen. You know that thing I said about¡­

35:25.780 --> 35:28.642
You'd buy this because it's got two extra seats in the back.

35:28.819 --> 35:30.277
- Yeah, yeah.
- The Aston hasn't got any.

35:30.319 --> 35:31.673
- Irrelevant.
- Why?

35:31.716 --> 35:35.230
Because while you're away, OK, imagining that you're a dog.

35:35.518 --> 35:37.502
- Chicken.
- Chicken. Whatever, OK.

35:37.637 --> 35:41.455
The EU had said that now if you're your height, you've got to have like a booster seat.

35:41.958 --> 35:43.481
- No seriously, they have.
- Yeah.

35:43.558 --> 35:44.582
I know it came to here.

35:44.590 --> 35:46.239
The thing is that to fit in there you got to be your height,

35:46.239 --> 35:48.000
but now you've got to have a seat.

35:48.559 --> 35:50.291
- Yeah?
- Which means you aren't gonna fit.

35:50.308 --> 35:51.366
Oh, you'll be too big with a booster seat...

35:51.366 --> 35:53.068
And no one will ever be able to get in the back.

35:53.068 --> 35:56.421
That's gonna be the same for all these 2+2s with tiny little back seats then

35:56.463 --> 35:59.595
Exactly, the EU's rendered them useless, so you might as well buy the Aston on that front.

35:59.976 --> 36:03.467
Thing is though, I do still really adore this car.

36:03.470 --> 36:07.136
And now we've gotta find out how fast it goes round our track.

36:07.136 --> 36:10.065
And that of course means handing it over to our tame racing driver.

36:10.751 --> 36:14.653
Some say he once threw a microwave oven at a tramp,

36:16.624 --> 36:20.181
and that long before anyone else he realized that Jade Goody was

36:20.562 --> 36:23.590
a racist pig-faced waste of blood and organs.

36:28.335 --> 36:29.119
But he didn't.

36:37.732 --> 36:40.716
All we know is he's called the Stig.

36:42.551 --> 36:43.575
And he's off.

36:44.490 --> 36:48.733
We can hear the super charger whining over that thunderous V8 base line.

36:49.359 --> 36:51.124
Just look how wet it is out there.

36:52.732 --> 36:55.555
Ok Stig ploughs fearlessly into that corner.

36:55.555 --> 36:56.596
<i>Radio: I change my mind.</i>

36:57.205 --> 37:01.069
<i>I want the chance to spend the rest of my life, loving you.</i>

37:01.484 --> 37:05.670
Oh dear, the Stig seems to have developed a taste for romantic fiction on CD.

37:06.111 --> 37:09.147
OK, he's through Chicago, sliding around like a go-cart.

37:09.231 --> 37:10.502
Here he is coming into Hammerhead.

37:11.061 --> 37:13.211
Plagues of melted snow every where.

37:13.253 --> 37:15.768
Is he gonna understeer? Not a bit of it. Look at that!

37:15.776 --> 37:18.367
You see there is no car that drifts like this one.

37:20.838 --> 37:22.144
With the backward plaining.

37:22.398 --> 37:26.445
<i>Radio: With her own golden haired ruddy faced Archilles</i>

37:27.257 --> 37:29.060
He's really got the hammer down now.

37:29.060 --> 37:32.802
you see the car twitching over the standing water. Stig isn't faced.

37:33.214 --> 37:35.762
Maybe it's 'cause his home planet is quite swampy.

37:36.101 --> 37:37.764
Err¡­penultimate to the corner,

37:38.120 --> 37:40.279
dips into the grass, Gambon now,

37:40.304 --> 37:43.354
hard in, chucks it side ways

37:43.667 --> 37:45.572
and across the line!

37:47.436 --> 37:47.766
Now

37:50.174 --> 37:51.258
he did it...

37:52.432 --> 37:54.743
in 1:34.7,

37:54.751 --> 37:58.705
which is obvious pathetic, but I think it was really very very very wet.

37:58.739 --> 38:00.652
Err.. we were gonna put the Aston round afterwards,

38:00.660 --> 38:02.582
but it started to snow again, so don't blame us

38:02.607 --> 38:03.572
Err... 'cause we didn't bother,

38:03.801 --> 38:05.672
don't blame the Stig do what every one else does.

38:05.994 --> 38:07.273
And just blame Global Warming.

38:08.949 --> 38:11.268
Now earlier on we set out on a mission

38:11.268 --> 38:14.519
to demonstrate that roadworks needn't take so long

38:14.824 --> 38:21.410
Warwickshire council reckoned it will take 5 days to resurface a 1.5 mile stretch of the D5481.

38:21.876 --> 38:26.100
But we reckoned, by working hard, and not get all tangled up in Health and Safty

38:26.278 --> 38:28.564
We could do it in just 24 hours

38:29.023 --> 38:31.953
And when we left the action it was going really rather well I thought.

38:31.995 --> 38:35.872
Hammond here was down at the quarry keeping up a steady stream of fresh tarmac

38:36.193 --> 38:38.546
I was driving a paver laying it on the road

38:38.572 --> 38:41.456
and Jeremy was fulfilling the vital role

38:41.507 --> 38:43.844
of shouting at everyone down a megaphone.

38:50.223 --> 38:51.538
Come on! Put it back into it.

38:51.563 --> 38:53.299
You, man, here, let me show you.

38:54.585 --> 38:57.413
But then all of a sudden everything went wrong.

38:58.860 --> 38:59.961
Run out of tarmac!

39:00.582 --> 39:01.759
What do you mean you've run out?

39:01.962 --> 39:03.495
For Hammonds lorry's not here.

39:03.613 --> 39:04.987
We need a thousand tons.

39:05.351 --> 39:08.111
And his lorry load only does that little stretch there.

39:08.475 --> 39:09.982
And if he doesn't get it here quick enough

39:09.982 --> 39:12.497
that bitumen stuff goes off and it won't stick.

39:13.157 --> 39:14.890
<i>Hammond we're out!</i>

39:15.330 --> 39:16.325
We've done 100 feet.

39:16.325 --> 39:18.636
<i> How many trucks have you got working on this?</i>

39:18.636 --> 39:19.911
We've got three in here now

39:19.911 --> 39:22.772
We've got one be loaded one on the way bridge that I can see.

39:22.772 --> 39:24.559
<i> And I am... I can't get anymore in it.</i>

39:24.694 --> 39:26.667
You've only got five trucks? Right.

39:26.701 --> 39:29.240
<i> Are there any other roadwork's going on today?</i>

39:30.502 --> 39:32.585
<i>- What? That we can nick their tarmac?
- Yeah.</i>

39:33.890 --> 39:35.955
I like your thinking there. that's quite devious.

39:36.243 --> 39:37.572
<i> Nick their tarmac.</i>

39:37.820 --> 39:39.454
Your next job, do you know where it's going?

39:39.809 --> 39:41.561
Is it going to... You see that's not our road

39:41.561 --> 39:43.237
Well that's useless. Send it to us.

39:43.390 --> 39:45.786
Just don't send it to them. We need it.

39:46.170 --> 39:48.294
Crack now to the max. And change that calendar.

39:48.294 --> 39:49.903
It's far too calming and relaxing.

39:53.734 --> 39:56.451
Move! Come on! Go!

39:56.477 --> 39:58.568
Fast, Get on with it!

39:59.076 --> 40:00.261
Hahahh, another one.

40:00.269 --> 40:01.288
I cracked the whip

40:01.406 --> 40:03.726
and even introduced an incentive scheme.

40:03.726 --> 40:05.928
I want you to go like the wind, OK?

40:06.258 --> 40:08.197
I'll pay you speeding fines.

40:09.148 --> 40:12.280
But the fact remained that the quarry was an hour away.

40:12.288 --> 40:14.092
And Hammond only had five trucks.

40:14.252 --> 40:15.819
That wasn't enough.

40:17.093 --> 40:20.721
The main reason why roadworks take a long time

40:21.356 --> 40:24.684
is because the trucks just don't come regularly enough.

40:24.684 --> 40:26.944
- That guy that... you're working with.
- Yeah.

40:27.147 --> 40:28.991
He said he's worked till the way it is now for 32 years

40:28.991 --> 40:31.539
24 of which has been standing around waiting for the trucks.

40:31.827 --> 40:32.907
We told Hammond this.

40:33.085 --> 40:36.776
We said to Hammond it's the only important thing: keep the trucks coming.

40:37.801 --> 40:40.138
The tarmac did continued to dribbled in,

40:40.138 --> 40:41.856
but far too slowly, and then

40:42.085 --> 40:43.075
Back at the quarry

40:45.024 --> 40:46.370
What's killed it? Why is it stopped?

40:46.396 --> 40:47.293
Emergency stop.

40:47.437 --> 40:49.100
Why is it in the emergency stop? There is no...

40:49.362 --> 40:50.895
Who's lent, we've lent on the what?

40:51.580 --> 40:52.786
- Who's...
- Your man.

40:52.845 --> 40:55.376
The camera man lent... we lent on the emergency...

40:56.902 --> 40:57.960
You stopped the plant?

40:58.883 --> 41:00.974
<i>Yeah, we sort of hit the emergency stop a bit.</i>

41:03.125 --> 41:03.972
Why have you done that?

41:04.116 --> 41:05.267
<i> Well this was a bloody accident, wasn't it.</i>

41:05.267 --> 41:06.994
<i> I didn't do it on purpose.</i>

41:07.316 --> 41:09.008
Richard, Richard, Richard

41:09.152 --> 41:12.038
I'm gonna make a suggestion: Don't come back here.

41:12.690 --> 41:13.977
Don't... don't come back,

41:14.095 --> 41:16.339
go away, go to Tierra del...

41:16.567 --> 41:20.597
Tierra del Fuego, and even I'm gonna hunt you down and kill you there as well.

41:23.727 --> 41:25.895
Men at the D5481

41:27.636 --> 41:29.820
This is our darkest hour

41:30.591 --> 41:33.833
We will not allow Adolf Hammond

41:34.112 --> 41:38.667
to ruin our plans for this great, this wonderful, this magnificent...

41:39.556 --> 41:40.165
Shut up!

41:42.324 --> 41:44.298
We buried the Health and Safety man

41:44.298 --> 41:46.939
While we waited for the quarry to restart.

41:47.752 --> 41:48.539
But it didn't

41:48.556 --> 41:50.707
It was five o'clock, knocking-off time.

41:51.613 --> 41:52.900
And they'd all gone home.

41:53.462 --> 41:55.367
We've shut down the plant, that...

41:55.376 --> 41:56.612
That's it. We can't work anymore.

41:57.340 --> 41:59.437
Well, your friends're on a 35-hour week

42:00.114 --> 42:02.104
Most jobs would stop at this point.

42:02.159 --> 42:06.691
But we used our initiative and found a new quarry that would stay open through the night.

42:07.284 --> 42:08.579
Where is it? This new one?

42:09.187 --> 42:11.270
<i>-  Ashbourne
- Ashbourne?</i>

42:11.312 --> 42:13.357
- That's in Kent.
- In Derbyshire.

42:13.357 --> 42:14.718
If I go over to Ashbourne with the other plant?

42:14.718 --> 42:17.469
Don't go to Ashbourne, don't go anywhere near a quarry.

42:17.704 --> 42:18.805
You're ruining it.

42:19.118 --> 42:21.708
And then just as we were getting on top of things.

42:23.911 --> 42:27.202
In the immortal words of Basil Fawlty: "Oh spiffing!"

42:29.606 --> 42:32.598
If a storm broke it wouldn't matter how much tarmac came.

42:32.598 --> 42:34.088
'Cause we wouldn't be able to lay it.

42:34.723 --> 42:36.611
Plainly, a speech was in order.

42:37.220 --> 42:40.028
We shall not go quietly into the night.

42:41.044 --> 42:43.496
We are faced diversity in the day shift, but...

42:59.240 --> 43:01.264
As night fell, the rain came.

43:01.425 --> 43:04.094
And in a normal roadworks that would be that.

43:05.279 --> 43:07.233
But I refused to let anyone stop

43:07.326 --> 43:10.382
Because the second quarry had just started to deliver.

43:10.804 --> 43:13.200
This is a sight to warm the cockles of your heart.

43:13.514 --> 43:15.572
- Marvelous.
- Men working at night.

43:15.572 --> 43:18.518
You're always hearing people say that 'I went to Japan and they work through the night.'

43:18.518 --> 43:20.881
'I went to Switzerland, they work through the night.'

43:21.491 --> 43:24.009
Here we are in England and we're working through the night.

43:25.710 --> 43:29.080
And to make sure that people of Bidford got their work done quickly

43:29.173 --> 43:31.358
We've been working through our supper break as well.

43:33.627 --> 43:36.387
Can I have Cod and chips, 75 times

43:52.042 --> 43:54.489
- And a butter sausage.
- Yes, thank you.

43:59.748 --> 44:01.179
- Chips!
- Ohh!

44:01.179 --> 44:03.287
Yeah, but don't just grab them, I got to hand them out, I got a job for you.

44:03.287 --> 44:04.861
- Can you hand out the wipes?
- Yeah.

44:05.225 --> 44:07.248
- That'll appreciate...
- There you go.

44:07.282 --> 44:08.868
While Richard was getting supper,

44:08.910 --> 44:13.328
I'd installed another motivational tool to keep everyone spirits up.

44:13.896 --> 44:17.159
The night is dark, the road is long.

44:17.303 --> 44:19.436
And we are far from our families.

44:19.888 --> 44:20.836
But don't worry,

44:21.200 --> 44:24.088
Gentlemen at D5481,

44:24.257 --> 44:27.335
Because I have music to take us through the night!

44:28.123 --> 44:29.392
Chech it out!

44:32.257 --> 44:33.831
It's put me off the sausage.

44:40.275 --> 44:41.392
/One-all, James.

44:43.946 --> 44:45.791
This is how you run roadworks

44:45.800 --> 44:47.797
Good fish and chips, good music

44:47.873 --> 44:49.812
No Health and no Safty.

44:50.235 --> 44:53.087
I just think that this is the happiest roadwork crew

44:53.146 --> 44:55.858
working in the land right now anywhere.

44:56.484 --> 44:59.845
The guys also like the willingness of the bosses to muck in.

45:00.031 --> 45:03.570
And with that in mind, James and Richard took over the roller.

45:03.663 --> 45:05.754
You've got to, just overlap the edge of this.

45:05.754 --> 45:08.879
If I go too far over the edge just stick it in the verge, and then you've got to..

45:08.879 --> 45:10.538
No, God, bugger

45:11.020 --> 45:13.112
You've run over the stop cock you cock.

45:13.188 --> 45:14.296
I heard it go clanging.

45:14.973 --> 45:16.776
Woo, that's bad, we are gonna in trouble.

45:16.790 --> 45:18.339
Who are we gonna tell about this?

45:18.678 --> 45:21.819
Ahh. Well, what we could do is take steamroller.

45:23.433 --> 45:24.796
- And just keep going?
- Yeah.

45:30.614 --> 45:34.458
At 4 am, there were still 700 yards to go.

45:34.466 --> 45:36.202
And the men were flagging.

45:37.438 --> 45:41.195
So, I brought out the motivational big gun

45:41.195 --> 45:43.488
... another Winter of discontent?

45:44.013 --> 45:46.002
This is... Mrs Thatcher

45:46.900 --> 45:48.229
- Yeah.
- To motivate the men.

45:49.491 --> 45:50.354
This is going well.

45:51.079 --> 45:55.439
And I hope it will be followed by a Winter of common sense.

45:55.531 --> 45:58.020
Yes, I like that one.

45:58.036 --> 45:59.688
Don't encourage him, man, this is...

45:59.688 --> 46:02.795
The chaps however were not telegraph readers like James

46:02.804 --> 46:07.301
So I promised them that the sooner they finish the laying the sooner I'll switch her off.

46:10.297 --> 46:13.511
That worked, and by day break the road was resurfaced

46:13.993 --> 46:17.080
But there were still only time for a quick power breakfast.

46:17.910 --> 46:19.579
Why do tramps live in London?

46:20.197 --> 46:21.509
- When there is all this out here.
- Yeah.

46:24.548 --> 46:28.823
We'd promised the people of Bidford they'd have their road back by 9:07

46:28.831 --> 46:30.270
And there was still much to do

46:30.703 --> 46:32.134
The plants needed clearing

46:32.142 --> 46:34.191
Hammond needed to get the signs back up.

46:34.640 --> 46:37.266
And James and I had the white lines to paint.

46:37.596 --> 46:40.048
Look, that's a little bit, OK?

46:41.623 --> 46:43.283
- That perfect.
- It isn't.

46:44.240 --> 46:46.280
Hahhaha..

46:47.305 --> 46:48.262
We did our best,

46:48.295 --> 46:51.097
but the men from the council didn't seem impressed.

46:51.732 --> 46:56.218
Hehahaha..

46:56.814 --> 47:00.238
We had made a terrible mess of the lines and with the clock ticking

47:00.365 --> 47:02.008
we ram to see Hammond,

47:02.397 --> 47:05.174
who've made a even bigger mess with his signs.

47:05.284 --> 47:06.164
The hill is there,

47:07.519 --> 47:09.382
And that's... you're going that way.

47:10.161 --> 47:11.312
They should be facing that way.

47:11.719 --> 47:14.749
You're right, I'm just telling people they've just been around some bends.

47:14.766 --> 47:16.155
- And down a hill.
- Go away, leave me lone.

47:16.214 --> 47:16.696
Alright.

47:17.213 --> 47:19.391
As it turned out, he's done them all wrong.

47:19.416 --> 47:22.515
And we had just ten minutes to put them right.

47:22.515 --> 47:23.491
Oh, bloody hell!

47:23.516 --> 47:25.319
- Did you do this stuff?  - Yeah.
- Right, stand back.

47:25.641 --> 47:26.388
How did you do it...

47:27.540 --> 47:28.920
- There you go. Perfect.
- There. That's it, finished.

47:29.004 --> 47:30.240
- Open road!
- Right.

47:32.836 --> 47:34.867
I've been wanting to do this for a long time.

47:36.108 --> 47:36.802
Oh, come on!

47:37.217 --> 47:38.444
I'm coming.

47:39.217 --> 47:41.293
You're the one who's been shouting all day.

47:41.506 --> 47:47.084
So there you are. People of Bidford-on-Avon in just under one day,

47:47.973 --> 47:49.031
your road is open.

47:49.886 --> 47:51.232
Glad to be of service.

48:02.220 --> 48:05.168
If we can do that... If we can do that.

48:05.414 --> 48:06.565
They should be able to do that.

48:06.565 --> 48:09.782
Really we do have some Top Gear top tips here for the construction industry.

48:10.369 --> 48:11.581
Work fast,

48:12.038 --> 48:13.139
Eat blackberries

48:13.537 --> 48:16.187
Get 100 trucks, not 5.

48:16.280 --> 48:19.011
Yeah, and fit that paving machine thing with a turbo charger

48:19.028 --> 48:20.907
- Yeah, and don't let him drive it
- No, don't do that.

48:21.285 --> 48:24.425
Anyway, now, it's the moment

48:24.713 --> 48:25.771
you've all been waiting for.

48:27.151 --> 48:29.775
Devena is live on state of the Big Brother.

48:30.156 --> 48:32.560
winner is about to be announced.

48:33.356 --> 48:35.948
Here on BBC2 however we got our little fella's car crash

48:35.999 --> 48:37.235
So come on mate, talk us through it.

48:37.334 --> 48:39.552
Oh Ok. Well, and look, we got some video of it we never looked.

48:39.561 --> 48:41.559
Here is umm.. Here's before it happened.

48:41.576 --> 48:44.134
This is the car. It's called the Vampire.

48:44.329 --> 48:49.133
Basically it's just a socking great jet engine with a chair bolted to the front of it.That's it.

48:49.573 --> 48:50.724
So is it high tech?

48:51.029 --> 48:51.867
Yes, it's fairly high tech.

48:51.876 --> 48:54.178
The engine, the jet engine, comes out of a Red Arrow.

48:54.601 --> 48:57.759
The steering box is from a Reliant Robin.

48:58.256 --> 49:00.169
And the fuel pumps from a cement mixer.

49:02.075 --> 49:04.174
Oh, that's the airfield where I was gonna be driving it.

49:04.191 --> 49:06.765
- See, that's in Elvington near York.
- Oh, it's complicated.

49:07.906 --> 49:13.365
There is of course one thing you really don't want when you're doing this sort of stuff up a runway.

49:13.713 --> 49:15.550
Like that one. Cross winds.

49:18.792 --> 49:20.067
Yeah, there was a bit of breeze.

49:20.076 --> 49:21.693
Oh that was me getting in it, you see.

49:21.848 --> 49:22.728
At there and...

49:23.101 --> 49:25.649
And then I got a briefing from the man who built it.

49:26.026 --> 49:28.693
So my challenge today is to drive this thing,

49:29.447 --> 49:32.377
except, that's not the full story

49:32.631 --> 49:37.754
Because my challenge today is to drive this thing and hit this innocent-looking little button.

49:38.254 --> 49:41.785
Because when I do that, it sends a flame, shooting through the engine

49:42.005 --> 49:43.413
which ignites the afterburner.

49:43.794 --> 49:46.808
And when that happens I haven't got 5,000 horse power,

49:47.244 --> 49:49.860
I've got, 10,000 horse power,

49:50.410 --> 49:53.974
I'm possibly the biggest accident, you've ever seen in your life.

49:58.567 --> 50:00.134
I bet when you said that,

50:00.150 --> 50:01.573
it was one of those...

50:03.746 --> 50:04.355
Yeah!

50:06.355 --> 50:08.700
Pathetic, very pathetic.

50:10.613 --> 50:12.213
And I bet when you said that you thought

50:12.230 --> 50:16.380
it's one of those snappy lines to make this look a bit more dangerous than it really is.

50:16.414 --> 50:18.844
It's exactly what I thought when I said it.

50:18.886 --> 50:20.959
Can I just qualify something about it? Is it...

50:21.120 --> 50:23.360
It doesn't have like a throttle in the accelerator.

50:23.394 --> 50:25.485
- Like a normal car.
- No, a jet car. No, it is complete different to drive.

50:25.519 --> 50:27.319
There is no clutches or such.

50:27.345 --> 50:29.259
You just turn the engine up to what you want with the knob on the dash.

50:29.259 --> 50:30.351
That's before you set off.

50:30.377 --> 50:31.875
Yeah, you do that when you start it, you leave it.

50:31.892 --> 50:33.018
So there is no accelerator.

50:33.027 --> 50:35.058
You pull away by just taking you foot off the footbrake.

50:35.084 --> 50:36.100
You don't touch that again.

50:36.287 --> 50:38.370
So when you're going along, what you've got is a steering wheel

50:38.594 --> 50:40.677
and a lever to stop the engine and pull the parachute.

50:40.719 --> 50:41.752
So it's quite simple.

50:41.786 --> 50:43.726
Oh, it's easier to control than your chair, mate.

50:45.190 --> 50:47.484
Ok, well, let's have a look what happened next.

50:47.776 --> 50:50.155
Let us get these, err... just keep your arms through there.

50:51.686 --> 50:52.499
What're they for?

50:52.863 --> 50:53.735
These are arm strands

50:54.395 --> 50:57.246
Uh, in event if you're going upside down.

50:58.134 --> 50:59.709
They'll stop your arms coming out of the cockpit

51:01.345 --> 51:02.572
I don't want to go upside down.

51:04.536 --> 51:05.171
Throttle

51:05.907 --> 51:07.355
Set to half.

51:07.559 --> 51:09.176
OK, so ignition

51:12.214 --> 51:13.509
Bloody hell fire.

51:13.915 --> 51:15.168
That's a jet's engine.

51:16.748 --> 51:18.187
Holy crap.

51:20.199 --> 51:21.934
This is terrifying!

51:29.591 --> 51:31.094
Here we go. This is it.

51:33.541 --> 51:34.480
Oh my god.

51:35.411 --> 51:38.824
The feel's just unbelievable. And it's vibrating.

51:39.399 --> 51:42.184
Oh my God, Oh my God!

51:44.250 --> 51:45.943
I can feel it pulling to the right!

51:48.147 --> 51:49.592
I'm on the black tarmac.

51:49.905 --> 51:54.485
/ / to use the parashute, I need a parachute

51:59.562 --> 52:00.172
That...

52:01.323 --> 52:01.949
is...

52:03.465 --> 52:04.413
Oh, it's amazing.

52:04.904 --> 52:07.020
Ah... (DEEP BREATH)

52:10.881 --> 52:11.880
Ahhh!

52:11.888 --> 52:14.292
I just want to go faster.

52:15.085 --> 52:16.076
More speed.

52:16.220 --> 52:17.151
How quick was that.

52:17.278 --> 52:19.028
Eh, that's 220.4.

52:22.939 --> 52:24.317
- 220.
- Yeah.

52:25.714 --> 52:26.867
Now we are achieving...

52:27.366 --> 52:30.160
pretty close to that kind of speed now on our own runway here.

52:30.331 --> 52:32.727
So what's the difference you say a Lambo here and that?

52:32.761 --> 52:35.285
It's just the way the jet engine delivers the power.

52:35.285 --> 52:37.173
You're aware that there is so much of it.

52:37.190 --> 52:39.201
Just a huge amount of power going on.

52:39.252 --> 52:41.572
So it's a sensation of that more than the actual speed.

52:41.868 --> 52:44.946
How did you know though when to pull the parachute lever.

52:45.327 --> 52:47.668
En, well we just put some cones out on the runway so...

52:47.703 --> 52:49.546
You see I would have pull it much sooner than that.

52:49.690 --> 52:50.850
I'm off! It's gone.

52:52.356 --> 52:54.545
I'd pulled it before I set off. Just in case.

52:55.722 --> 52:58.143
With hindsight, yeah. Bet... better idea perhaps.

52:58.358 --> 53:01.626
OK, so next time it was the afterburner.

53:01.778 --> 53:02.714
Yes, absolutely.

53:02.917 --> 53:04.559
And you can see that in the film, can you?

53:04.585 --> 53:08.361
Yeah, you'll see you'll know when it's lit because this flame's coming out of the back of the engine.

53:08.513 --> 53:10.435
OK. Now I have to explain to everybody in case you don't know

53:10.443 --> 53:13.775
An afterburner is really only fits to the fastest military jets.

53:14.157 --> 53:16.452
Or, and Concord, actually, for that matter.

53:16.485 --> 53:19.846
A Harrier jump jet, for instance, doesn't have one.

53:20.083 --> 53:22.027
Ok, it's not deemed necessary for that.

53:22.272 --> 53:25.176
But he was about to light one in a car.

53:26.266 --> 53:26.596
Yeah.

53:27.722 --> 53:28.840
Well I wanted to do this,

53:29.085 --> 53:29.745
And now I am.

53:29.974 --> 53:32.531
I've emm... I'd be lying if I said I wasn't

53:33.750 --> 53:34.732
quite scared.

53:36.494 --> 53:36.943
However...

53:39.040 --> 53:42.079
I think it's the fact that once you started, that's it.

53:42.153 --> 53:44.414
You don't mess about with the throttle. Once it go, you go.

53:46.081 --> 53:49.099
That's, you know... commitment.

53:50.928 --> 53:52.443
Here we go, here we go, here we go, come on.

53:53.577 --> 53:54.993
This is it. I've got to be going.

53:58.625 --> 54:00.084
Ohh Hahaaaa!

54:25.851 --> 54:31.190
You /

54:31.215 --> 54:33.899
Yes, I can't describe. I...

54:35.255 --> 54:36.720
I think I'm gonna cry.

54:37.939 --> 54:39.065
I'm not joking.

54:39.188 --> 54:42.345
Every part of my body is full...

54:43.016 --> 54:43.930
of adrenaline

54:45.081 --> 54:46.283
Oh, yes.

54:46.749 --> 54:49.965
I'm so alive. I'm so alive.

55:08.046 --> 55:09.926
Now that looked really quick.

55:10.019 --> 55:12.464
That was quicker. That was 314 miles an hour.

55:13.260 --> 55:18.077
And that is the fastest anyone's actually traveled in Britain before, isn't it?

55:18.339 --> 55:19.707
Well, technically, I suppose it is.

55:19.707 --> 55:22.570
'Cause I think the British land speed record is 301 miles an hour.

55:22.570 --> 55:23.801
- In that car?
- Yes.

55:23.801 --> 55:25.911
- Nobody's gonna beat it.
- No, probably not now. No.

55:27.511 --> 55:29.814
But to be an official record, you've got do

55:29.814 --> 55:32.996
another run in the other direction then take an average of the 2 speeds.

55:33.005 --> 55:35.858
The worse we know from telemetry that that was 314,

55:35.884 --> 55:38.043
- Oh yeah!
- that's the fastest anyone's ever traveled.

55:38.242 --> 55:39.960
Oh yeah, but it's not, you know, official record.

55:40.392 --> 55:41.332
So what's it feel like?

55:42.008 --> 55:43.142
Eh, fast.

55:43.523 --> 55:47.173
Eh, it's... I weren't trying to set a record.

55:47.173 --> 55:49.018
I just wanted to get really really fast.

55:49.077 --> 55:51.083
- But you did 314
- Yeah.

55:51.354 --> 55:53.868
- and you wanted to know what it was like to go really fast.
- Yeah.

55:53.885 --> 55:54.994
So you'd found out.

55:55.460 --> 55:57.875
Why didn't you just get in your car and go home?

55:58.688 --> 55:59.772
I don't know really.

56:00.009 --> 56:02.777
Emm, the thing is that run that you just saw

56:02.811 --> 56:07.028
that was at 5 o'clock and we had the runway until 5:30.

56:07.308 --> 56:07.753
And...

56:09.886 --> 56:11.613
I know now obviously,

56:11.655 --> 56:14.044
Eh, I don't know, I think it's a bit like, you know, when you were a kid,

56:14.044 --> 56:15.288
and you are out playing with your mates.

56:15.407 --> 56:17.864
And then your Mom would shout for you to come in for your tea.

56:17.898 --> 56:20.548
And you just pushing a bit and keep going a bit longer.

56:20.677 --> 56:22.759
And that's always when you fall out of the tree.

56:23.521 --> 56:25.584
With hindsight again, yes

56:25.906 --> 56:28.940
Well, alright. I suppose this it is then, isn't it really now?

56:29.194 --> 56:30.490
This is what happened next, yeah.

56:57.880 --> 56:59.489
It was all over quite quickly so

56:59.531 --> 57:00.818
do it again in slow motion.

57:01.165 --> 57:04.396
You can see the moment when the tire goes.

57:04.396 --> 57:06.528
It's still doing 288 miles an hour here.

57:07.247 --> 57:09.703
But then it's off. It's away.

57:10.041 --> 57:13.754
I think it's about 0.4 of a second really from the tire blowing to it all going wrong.

57:15.252 --> 57:18.265
Then when it digs in on the grass, the car rolls.

57:18.612 --> 57:22.279
It's still doing 230 when it's upside down on the grass

57:23.795 --> 57:27.732
which is so... here now it's still doing 230 mph when it's upside and down.

57:28.401 --> 57:29.643
Then it flips a bit.

57:30.870 --> 57:33.029
And then it settles down.

57:33.116 --> 57:36.849
And the rollbar digs into the ground along with my head. And that stops it very quickly,

57:38.493 --> 57:39.657
Indeed.

57:41.760 --> 57:42.499
Oh, thank you.

57:54.659 --> 57:57.131
The tragedy is, that would be

57:57.606 --> 57:59.663
the fastest car crash ever in Britain.

58:00.036 --> 58:03.134
But Guinness Book of Records' people saying you got do it going in the other direction.

58:05.407 --> 58:07.583
I don't want the record. It's not what I want.

58:07.972 --> 58:10.199
So you've come away with no record at all

58:10.207 --> 58:12.952
for having done that. That's a bit of a tragedy.

58:13.468 --> 58:15.077
The thing is though, can I just ask,

58:15.610 --> 58:18.446
you can see again in the crash run,

58:18.448 --> 58:19.523
Ok, your last run.

58:20.031 --> 58:22.918
The tire is starting to come apart.

58:22.977 --> 58:25.618
Ok, if we watch this you can see it, look at it, on the right end tyre.

58:25.864 --> 58:26.651
Look there.

58:27.792 --> 58:28.664
Now

58:28.952 --> 58:29.560
I'm sorry mate,

58:30.000 --> 58:31.617
why didn't you spot that.

58:31.812 --> 58:32.193
Well...

58:33.014 --> 58:36.544
I hadn't known all. I was doing 288 miles an hour.

58:36.595 --> 58:37.364
I can have a lot.

58:37.364 --> 58:39.904
I'm in the office the kids are shouting, I'm writting a story and I'm on the phone.

58:39.921 --> 58:42.935
If a lion walks in I'm going to notice it.

58:43.349 --> 58:47.262
It was 0.4 of a second from the tire started to go to the accident started.

58:47.516 --> 58:48.202
I could have held it.

58:50.310 --> 58:52.317
What, in the world's longest power slide?

58:52.740 --> 58:55.449
Whilst telling us about the price and there was no room in the boot?

58:55.483 --> 58:57.082
- Easy-peasy.
- Yeah.

58:57.083 --> 58:58.031
The problem is

58:58.353 --> 59:01.714
fundamentally you weren't wearing your EU booster seat.

59:01.833 --> 59:04.230
You were too low and you couldn't see it.

59:04.264 --> 59:05.890
If I had a booster seat on,

59:05.932 --> 59:08.101
my head would have come off when it rolled eventually.

59:08.194 --> 59:09.472
Have you read the highway codes?

59:09.523 --> 59:11.258
Well, I didn't have a copy with me.

59:11.284 --> 59:12.977
Because it quite plainly says here,

59:13.205 --> 59:16.647
When the car goes out of control, steer into the skid.

59:17.747 --> 59:18.653
He's right.

59:18.772 --> 59:20.963
Look, the expert guys that did the telemetry that was on the car

59:20.980 --> 59:22.266
you know the computers and stuff,

59:22.368 --> 59:25.155
they said I had the reactions of a fighter pilot.

59:28.163 --> 59:30.508
They didn't say it was a World War I fighter pilot.

59:32.463 --> 59:37.360
Riding-my-Sopwith-Camel-wooden-controls fighter pilot, exactly.

59:37.487 --> 59:40.936
No,  I think we could sit here as we have done for the last few months to take the Mickey out of you.

59:40.936 --> 59:43.288
The fact is though I would just like to say:

59:43.929 --> 59:45.817
you were very brave to getting in that thing.

59:45.869 --> 59:48.501
It's not something I would have done. It certainly not something he would have done.

59:48.992 --> 59:52.098
But more than that I think you've just performed a miracle

59:52.158 --> 59:55.078
and really brave getting well and getting back on the show again.

59:55.188 --> 59:55.733
Thanks mate.

59:57.951 --> 59:58.615
You've...

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:01.214
You just been nice to me.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.194
I promise, I promise I'll never do it again, ever.

01:00:04.194 --> 01:00:06.632
Good, talking about things will never happen again

01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:10.198
That we never mention that crash on Top Gear again.

01:00:10.529 --> 01:00:11.519
- Never.
- Ever.

01:00:11.519 --> 01:00:12.311
You up for that?

01:00:12.555 --> 01:00:14.485
- What?
- Never gonna mention the crash.

01:00:16.864 --> 01:00:17.406
There you go.

01:00:20.708 --> 01:00:23.120
We will never mention that crash again. That's a promise.

01:00:23.146 --> 01:00:25.596
We won't mention it now 'cause that is the end of the show.

01:00:25.994 --> 01:00:29.649
The thing is though we have learned an important lesson today. Thanks to Richard.

01:00:30.157 --> 01:00:32.510
Do please remember. Speed kills.

01:00:36.495 --> 01:00:38.679
See you next week. Take care. Thanks for watching.
