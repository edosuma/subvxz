00:25.559 --> 00:28.631
So I'm supposed to land on a
truck going 60 miles an hour?

00:28.695 --> 00:29.935
No, I'm going to.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.442
He's a killer and a thief. His movie stunt is

00:32.499 --> 00:34.103
probably a cover for another caper.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.306
Then we no longer need you, Mr. Hawke.

00:40.007 --> 00:42.283
There's no way that I'm
going to undercut Dominic.

00:42.342 --> 00:43.844
Even if you could save his life?

00:43.911 --> 00:44.912
Come on.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.288
Won't you even fight me like I'm still a man?

00:47.347 --> 00:49.657
He's crazy! He's going to kill us.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.524
Do something.

01:55.816 --> 01:59.525
File A56-7W. Top secret.
Subject: Airwolf.

01:59.586 --> 02:01.395
A Mach 1-plus attack helicopter,

02:01.455 --> 02:03.332
sought by governments friendly and foreign,

02:03.390 --> 02:06.234
Airwolf has been hidden by
test pilot Stringfellow Hawke

02:06.293 --> 02:07.670
to be returned to the government

02:07.728 --> 02:11.505
only if his brother Sin Jin,
an MIA in Vietnam, can be found.

02:12.199 --> 02:15.442
Michael Goldsmith-Briggs III,
code name Archangel,

02:15.502 --> 02:19.075
Deputy Director of the intelligence
agency that developed Airwolf,

02:19.139 --> 02:21.449
believed to covertly
provide logistical support

02:21.508 --> 02:23.351
to Hawke in exchange for flying Airwolf

02:23.410 --> 02:25.447
on missions of national interest.

02:25.512 --> 02:28.425
Hawke is 34, reclusive, sensitive, a loner,

02:28.482 --> 02:31.895
known to associate with his only
friend and mentor, Dominic Santini.

02:31.952 --> 02:34.091
Together, Hawke and Santini fly Airwolf

02:34.154 --> 02:36.225
at speeds rivaling the fastest jets.

02:36.289 --> 02:37.962
Backed by unmatched firepower,

02:38.025 --> 02:39.663
Airwolf is a weapon too dangerous

02:39.726 --> 02:41.330
to be left in un-enlightened hands.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.841
Finding Airwolf is your number 1 priority.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.308
End of file.

03:28.275 --> 03:30.482
Hold that truck at 60!

03:50.297 --> 03:52.834
That idiot is going to run out of road.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.985
Vinnie, you're running out of time.

04:16.555 --> 04:18.968
Vinnie. Vinnie, are you all right?

04:37.778 --> 04:39.519
He dropped right here.

04:39.579 --> 04:42.583
Come on, guys, let's go see if he's all right.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.527
Hey! Hey!

04:49.389 --> 04:51.300
Vinnie, are you all right? Vinnie!

04:51.725 --> 04:54.729
Yeah, at least I'm in one piece.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.640
This thing can't be done.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.904
Come on. Help him out. Come on.

05:07.374 --> 05:08.717
Hello, Simon.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.687
I see you have succeeded in failing again.

05:13.113 --> 05:17.493
I'm sorry, Mr. Maurice, but I don't
really think that stunt can be done.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.861
The script was approved and budgeted.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.763
You agreed to it, Simon.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.233
There'll be no changes.

05:23.290 --> 05:26.032
Vinnie is one of the best
pilots in the business.

05:26.092 --> 05:28.538
He did the flying in the
Green Cloudburst film.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.404
Who's the best, Simon?

05:30.463 --> 05:32.500
Santini Air, but that won't be easy.

05:32.566 --> 05:35.410
I'll only deal with legitimate organizations.

05:35.435 --> 05:37.676
Well, they're legitimate, all right.

05:37.704 --> 05:40.651
It's, just that they're a lot more expensive.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.380
Mr. Sayes,

05:42.442 --> 05:46.117
I discovered you at the bottom of
the barrel of used-to-be Directors.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.251
I've given you the opportunity
to become a wealthy man

05:49.316 --> 05:51.523
if this film is successful.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.731
Do not pinch pennies on my behalf or yours.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.461
Now, do you understand?

05:56.890 --> 05:58.335
I think so.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.164
No, don't think, Sayes.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.165
Just listen

06:04.431 --> 06:05.637
and do.

06:07.801 --> 06:08.871
Yes, sir.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.013
What have you got against rich?

06:17.077 --> 06:19.421
I don't know. I never did it.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.653
"Rich" ain't an "it," it's an "is."

06:22.716 --> 06:23.922
That's lousy English.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.521
Well, I'm talkin' money, not pronunciation.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.430
I don't need any right now.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.092
But I do.

06:31.424 --> 06:35.201
So, I'm supposed to land on a
truck going 60 miles an hour?

06:35.262 --> 06:36.900
No. I'm going to.

06:37.163 --> 06:39.439
I need you to work ground control.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.145
You want me to work ground?

06:43.203 --> 06:45.444
Yeah, you. Why, what's the matter?

06:47.340 --> 06:48.819
Nothin', Dom.

06:52.879 --> 06:55.325
Is the money really all that important?

06:55.682 --> 06:57.787
What are you trying to say?

06:57.884 --> 06:59.625
Come on, spit it out, String.

06:59.686 --> 07:02.758
You're chewin' on something
and not swallowin'.

07:04.491 --> 07:07.165
I don't think you ought to do this stunt.

07:09.396 --> 07:11.808
What, are you sayin' I can't do it?

07:11.965 --> 07:13.342
You think I'm washed up?

07:13.400 --> 07:16.347
Dom, I can't run the 100
in 10 seconds anymore.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.541
And I can't stay up for 3 days

07:18.605 --> 07:20.846
and bounce back with 4 hours' sleep.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.511
And sometimes, when it's real damp and cold,

07:23.576 --> 07:27.023
the man-made cracks in these
bones of mine ache like hell.

07:28.248 --> 07:31.752
I try to remember that when
I take one of these jobs.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.126
Well, maybe you're the one that's gettin' old.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.533
But I'm not ready to retire yet.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.362
I'm flyin' this stunt with or without you.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.373
Stringfellow Hawke?

07:54.240 --> 07:56.345
Is the name for real?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.485
It's for real.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.616
Only he won't be doin' the flyin'. I will.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.494
Great stuff, huh?

08:05.318 --> 08:08.561
I just might consider investing
in an orchard. Hey, Simon?

08:09.556 --> 08:10.762
Gentlemen.

08:12.058 --> 08:14.595
To the test run late this afternoon.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.375
There'll be no test run.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.878
I believe I'm covering the cost
of the test in the overall deal.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.506
Look, Mr. Santini,

08:26.706 --> 08:29.277
I just want to make sure that
you can do it, that's all.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.582
Oh, I'm sure.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.919
Because I'm not plannin' on killin' myself.

08:32.979 --> 08:36.620
Well, then why not do the
practice run just to satisfy me?

08:37.350 --> 08:40.490
Mister, I've got 30 years
of practicing under my belt.

08:40.553 --> 08:42.692
I don't think I need any more.

08:42.756 --> 08:47.227
Besides, it's gonna take me a couple
of days just to rig the helicopter,

08:47.293 --> 08:49.603
do some figurin' on the weights.

08:49.662 --> 08:52.040
And he said there wasn't much time.

08:52.832 --> 08:54.834
From what I hear, this…

08:56.036 --> 08:59.142
this Stringfellow Hawke
does most of the flying.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.247
I'm Santini Air.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.780
I decide who flies my equipment,

09:04.844 --> 09:06.721
or who uses my equipment.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.989
I'll deliver, or you don't
have to pay a red cent.

09:10.517 --> 09:13.225
Without this stunt my film doesn't work.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.399
Are you willing to pick
up the cost if you fail?

09:18.825 --> 09:20.998
You could lose your whole business.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.574
It's my business to lose, isn't it?

09:25.532 --> 09:29.503
Mr. Santini, you've got yourself a deal.

09:30.537 --> 09:34.314
Welcome aboard. Oh, by the way, Mr.
Sayes will handle everything.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.717
Gentlemen.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.763
What if he doesn't pull it off?

09:53.927 --> 09:57.238
The man is betting everything
he owns on his ability.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.670
He could still be wrong.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.270
I know.

10:01.367 --> 10:03.313
That's why I want you to contact this…

10:03.369 --> 10:04.541
Stringfellow.

10:04.637 --> 10:05.741
Whatever.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.539
Good morning, Edward.

10:35.602 --> 10:38.515
Morning. I can't drink coffee anymore.

10:38.571 --> 10:39.879
Gets my nerves raggedy.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.179
I know that.

10:41.941 --> 10:44.854
Take it. It's orange juice.

10:46.679 --> 10:50.684
If I didn't know you better, Mr.
Maurice, I'd swear my Mother sent you.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.457
God rest her soul.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.831
What do you say we hold the
services for later, all right?

10:56.890 --> 10:58.631
Sorry, Mr. Maurice.

10:58.691 --> 11:00.728
I'm just a little nervous.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.769
I think this should calm you down.

11:06.499 --> 11:10.140
I… I won't be able to have the
final schedule until tomorrow.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.214
Tomorrow will be fine.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.719
What if I'm not on duty?

11:15.775 --> 11:17.618
Make sure you're there.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.124
Yeah, but you see, it doesn't
work that way, Mr. Maurice.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.651
Mr. Stoner, you telling me that
you might be unable to deliver?

11:24.717 --> 11:26.458
No. No. I'll come through.

11:26.653 --> 11:28.189
I'm sure you will.

11:28.254 --> 11:31.167
You don't have to worry about me, Mr. Maurice.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.964
I have to worry about everything, Ed.

11:34.994 --> 11:37.702
You only have to worry about your health.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.719
You seem to have gone
to an awful lot of trouble

11:52.779 --> 11:54.417
contacting me by radio

11:54.981 --> 11:57.655
just to see if Dominic Santini can fly.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.129
Well, I know he can fly, Mr. Hawke,

12:00.453 --> 12:02.763
but can he do it as well as you?

12:03.356 --> 12:04.801
He taught me.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.437
How long ago?

12:07.460 --> 12:10.805
Dominic is one of the best
chopper pilots in the business.

12:11.030 --> 12:13.806
I hear that you're the best.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.976
Mr. Santini has given us
a completion guarantee

12:22.508 --> 12:24.749
that will either make him
a great deal of money

12:24.811 --> 12:26.552
or lose him his business.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.492
What's important is that if he fails,

12:29.549 --> 12:31.028
my film fails.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.930
What's important

12:33.553 --> 12:36.432
is that if he fails, he could lose his life.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.897
Yes. It would be a shame. Naturally.

12:40.860 --> 12:44.307
And apparently, it concerns
you as much as it does me.

12:44.964 --> 12:47.945
The only thing that seems to
concern you is your film.

12:48.001 --> 12:51.505
Well, I believe we can
satisfy all our purposes

12:52.071 --> 12:54.051
if you fly the stunt for me.

12:54.374 --> 12:55.944
It's Dominic's company.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.920
I can't tell him what to do.

12:57.977 --> 12:59.115
What is it? The money?

12:59.178 --> 13:01.180
I'm sure I can sway your thinking.

13:01.247 --> 13:02.851
It's not the money.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.426
Of course.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.827
I'm sure you'd like to
keep him hale and hearty.

13:08.888 --> 13:09.958
Here's my offer.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.094
I'll disregard the completion guarantee

13:12.158 --> 13:13.933
if you'll fly the stunt sequence.

13:13.993 --> 13:17.566
And, win or lose, your friend Mr.
Santini gets the best of it.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.769
His health and a sizable profit.

13:19.832 --> 13:22.176
I can't tell Dominic what to do.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.606
He's his own man.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.213
Think about it.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.286
But I want an answer by tomorrow noon.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.350
I can give you one right now.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.494
There's no way that I'm
going to undercut Dominic.

13:41.921 --> 13:44.265
Even if you could save his life?

13:53.466 --> 13:56.140
You know, junk food will kill you.

14:03.242 --> 14:06.121
What, you think my stomach's
too old to take it?

14:06.512 --> 14:09.015
You're going to tell me how to eat now, too?

14:09.182 --> 14:11.992
I didn't mean it like
that. I was just kiddin'.

14:12.218 --> 14:14.220
Some things aren't funny.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.098
Sorry, Dom.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.136
Okay. Accepted.

14:24.163 --> 14:26.734
What are you doin' here at this hour?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.040
I changed my mind.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.645
About what? The stunt?

14:38.311 --> 14:40.416
I'd like to do it with you.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.294
I knew you'd come around.

14:46.686 --> 14:50.156
Now, now, String, this stunt
is not as tough as it seems.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.703
All we need is a quarter-mile
of straight road

14:52.759 --> 14:55.638
and for the truck to go a steady 60, right?

14:55.695 --> 14:59.074
Now, I'll make a flying
approach lined up on the road.

14:59.132 --> 15:02.136
The critical part is the last 6 inches.

15:02.201 --> 15:04.909
You'll call them up from the camera ship. Huh?

15:04.971 --> 15:07.815
Once I touch down, we're rich.

15:11.778 --> 15:14.816
What's the matter? Oh. Oh, I forgot.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.883
You don't know from rich, huh?

15:20.319 --> 15:22.799
Dom, I meant I'd fly the stunt for you.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.369
Hey, come on, Dom, why are
you bein' so stubborn?

15:35.435 --> 15:38.507
Because I'm not an old man
ready for the rocking chair!

15:38.571 --> 15:40.482
I'm a pilot and a good one.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.281
I taught you, remember?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.588
You taught me how to survive, too.

15:48.014 --> 15:50.722
Evidently, I didn't teach you well enough.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.127
Because you're still standin' there.

15:53.853 --> 15:54.991
Hey, Dom...

15:55.988 --> 15:57.661
I mean it, String!

16:17.577 --> 16:18.647
I was on my way

16:18.711 --> 16:20.713
to an international conference on terrorism

16:20.780 --> 16:22.384
and you get me here for this?

16:22.448 --> 16:25.327
Dominic means a lot more to me than a "this."

16:25.384 --> 16:26.385
Okay.

16:27.553 --> 16:29.396
Grounding his entire operation

16:29.455 --> 16:31.230
just so that he won't fly a stunt

16:31.290 --> 16:33.327
could be considered overkill.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.394
Yeah, and if he crashes,
you call it underkill?

16:35.461 --> 16:37.498
You sure you're not bein' overprotective?

16:37.563 --> 16:41.010
No. Listen, at his age, his
reflexes have slowed enough

16:41.067 --> 16:43.411
that a stunt like this just could kill him.

16:43.469 --> 16:46.075
I could get the FAA to pull his license.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.883
That would kill him a whole lot quicker.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.717
Do you want my help or don't you?

16:51.777 --> 16:54.951
Yeah, I want your help, but
not by pullin' his ticket.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.324
There's got to be some other way.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.589
You sure don't make it easy.

16:59.785 --> 17:02.197
Well, that's why I called for the best.

17:03.990 --> 17:07.061
Please, Hawke, don't try flattery.

17:07.126 --> 17:08.969
You do it so badly.

17:12.565 --> 17:16.569
Maybe, maybe I could get the
State to pull the film permit

17:16.636 --> 17:19.549
just long enough for Dominic to calm down.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.642
That's a good idea. Thanks.

17:21.707 --> 17:25.211
Don't be grateful until you find
out what it's gonna cost you.

17:27.445 --> 17:28.652
What is it going to cost me?

17:28.714 --> 17:30.352
I'll think of something.

17:30.416 --> 17:33.158
What's the name of that production company?

17:35.922 --> 17:37.868
Bear Trap Productions.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.528
Some guy named Philip Maurice.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.308
What's the matter?

17:46.365 --> 17:48.242
Why don't you fly this stunt?

17:48.301 --> 17:50.281
I told you, Dominic won't let me.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.873
It's the production company's
decision, not Dominic's.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.976
If I fly it, I'd lose a friend.

17:55.041 --> 17:57.043
You'd be saving his life.

17:57.176 --> 17:58.587
You said you'd help.

17:58.644 --> 18:01.147
Now you're crawfishin' on me. How come?

18:05.451 --> 18:07.294
Philip Maurice.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.065
He's one of those brilliant
minds that has the ability

18:12.124 --> 18:15.628
to function totally without
conscience in a deadly manner.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.406
He masterminded a raid on a
diamond mine in South Africa.

18:19.465 --> 18:22.173
Hijacked uranium from a
defense plant in England.

18:22.234 --> 18:25.306
He stole a MiG-21 from Red China.

18:25.972 --> 18:28.543
You name it, Mr. Maurice has done it.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.811
Then every law enforcement agency in the world

18:30.876 --> 18:32.355
ought to be after him.

18:32.411 --> 18:34.857
Why don't you just grab him
and save us both a problem?

18:34.914 --> 18:35.915
It's not that simple.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.019
What he's done and what he can be charged with

18:38.084 --> 18:40.064
are 2 different things.

18:40.186 --> 18:43.599
Michael, there's something
you're not telling me.

18:48.060 --> 18:52.475
1978, he offered a KGB decoder
to the highest bidder.

18:53.265 --> 18:55.245
I take it that wasn't you.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.611
No, the Russians bought it back.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.741
You got outbid, eh?

19:00.239 --> 19:01.980
You remember Sonia?

19:03.709 --> 19:04.710
No.

19:07.346 --> 19:09.223
She'd only been with me about a year

19:09.281 --> 19:12.387
when she went to East Berlin
to bid on that decoder.

19:12.451 --> 19:15.330
When the Russians picked
it up, they also got her.

19:15.388 --> 19:19.768
I can't prove that Maurice turned her
over to them, but I know he did.

19:21.127 --> 19:24.574
Just as sure as I know the sun
will rise in the morning.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.071
I want him, Hawke.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.471
And this movie he's making is probably a front

19:31.537 --> 19:33.710
for somethin' I can nail him on.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.878
You know what you're asking me?

19:37.576 --> 19:40.386
If her name were Gabrielle instead of Sonia,

19:41.514 --> 19:43.425
what would you do then?

19:47.086 --> 19:48.759
I'll let you know.

20:02.234 --> 20:04.271
What, are you sayin' I can't do it?

20:04.336 --> 20:06.316
You think I'm washed up?

20:12.645 --> 20:15.057
At his age, his reflexes have slowed enough

20:15.114 --> 20:17.822
that a stunt like this just could kill him.

20:22.188 --> 20:25.032
I'm flyin' this stunt with or without you.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.734
I'm not an old man
ready for the rockin' chair!

20:30.796 --> 20:32.776
I'm a pilot and a good one.

20:37.036 --> 20:40.074
There's no way I'm going to undercut Dominic.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.250
Even if you could save his life?

20:43.776 --> 20:45.949
You'll fly the stunt?

20:46.011 --> 20:47.752
That's what I said.

20:48.147 --> 20:50.593
Mr. Maurice will be very pleased.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.758
I'd like to see him.

20:52.985 --> 20:55.761
He's out of town right now,
but I can sign the agreement.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.801
There's nothin' to sign.

20:58.524 --> 21:01.596
I'll do the flyin', you pay Santini Air.

21:08.334 --> 21:12.214
Why do I get the feeling Mr.
Santini knows nothing about this?

21:12.505 --> 21:16.351
I don't know, but whatever the
reason, it's none of your business.

21:20.312 --> 21:21.985
Okay, no problem.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.190
So when and where are we
gonna shoot this stunt?

21:26.051 --> 21:28.895
We'll be filming on several
locations around the world.

21:28.954 --> 21:33.460
Your sequence will be shot in
Northern California within 5 days.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.465
When and where, exactly?

21:36.529 --> 21:38.304
What difference does it make?

21:38.364 --> 21:42.904
Wind, weather, atmospheric conditions,
fuel supply, spare parts.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.679
Not your problem, we'll handle it.

21:45.738 --> 21:48.582
I'd like to know exactly
how you're handling that.

21:49.508 --> 21:51.818
This isn't our first production.

21:53.612 --> 21:55.091
Mine, either.

22:00.653 --> 22:03.600
I'll get you a copy of your action sequence

22:04.089 --> 22:05.534
and I'll get in touch with you

22:05.591 --> 22:08.697
about the rest of the details
in the morning, okay?

22:28.814 --> 22:32.990
Mr. Santini, this is Sayes
from Bear Trap Productions.

23:02.514 --> 23:04.516
I didn't expect it from you.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.324
Not you.

23:07.953 --> 23:10.593
I'm sorry, Dom, I had to do it.

23:10.856 --> 23:13.393
To make me feel like a useless old man?

23:14.126 --> 23:16.106
Well, that's not why I'm doin' it.

23:16.161 --> 23:18.141
Oh, you got a better reason?

23:18.464 --> 23:20.102
Yeah, if you'll listen.

23:20.165 --> 23:22.042
Oh, I'm all ears.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.385
Archangel knows Maurice.

23:28.707 --> 23:29.879
He's a killer and a thief.

23:29.942 --> 23:33.014
He's pulled off dozens of hi-tech
robberies all over the world.

23:33.078 --> 23:36.389
His movie stunt is probably
a cover for another caper.

23:37.283 --> 23:38.557
Archangel wants to nail him.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.290
He asked if I'd help.

23:43.789 --> 23:46.497
I'm supposed to believe this fairy tale?

23:47.426 --> 23:48.962
Dom, it's the truth.

23:49.328 --> 23:50.898
Okay, supposing it is,

23:50.963 --> 23:53.375
then why are you still flying
this stunt instead of me?

23:53.432 --> 23:55.673
I told you. Archangel asked me to help.

23:55.734 --> 23:57.111
Then do it from the ground.

23:57.169 --> 23:59.171
Probably give you a better position, anyway.

23:59.238 --> 24:00.683
Damn it, we've been through this.

24:00.739 --> 24:02.218
Yes, we have.

24:02.341 --> 24:04.947
You think I'm over the hill,
ready for the boneyard.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.853
No, I just think this one particular stunt

24:06.912 --> 24:09.085
might be just a little too risky.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.992
And if I can't cut it, then I want to know.

24:12.184 --> 24:14.027
Even if it kills you?

24:15.321 --> 24:16.561
Yeah, kid.

24:17.423 --> 24:19.198
Even if it kills me.

24:19.758 --> 24:20.930
Look, Dom…

24:23.729 --> 24:25.868
Come on. Come on.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.446
Won't you even fight me like I'm still a man?

24:55.194 --> 24:58.004
So now you're to land a
raiding party on the boxcar

24:58.063 --> 24:59.770
of a moving train,

24:59.832 --> 25:01.470
cut a hole in the roof,

25:01.533 --> 25:03.774
rescue the girl, and then take off

25:03.836 --> 25:06.282
to the strains of a symphony orchestra?

25:08.741 --> 25:10.118
Yeah, I know.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.950
Sounds like a bad TV movie to me, too.

25:14.013 --> 25:17.187
Or the perfect cover for
The Great Train Robbery.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.761
What is it that could be shipped by a train

25:19.818 --> 25:22.526
that would be worth all Maurice's efforts?

25:22.588 --> 25:25.091
Well, not everything goes by plane, Hawke.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.761
There's still a whole world out there

25:26.825 --> 25:29.271
in constant contact with the ground.

25:29.328 --> 25:32.673
Precious metals, computer parts, weapons,

25:32.731 --> 25:34.802
cash transfers, art.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.676
It could be any one of a thousand things.

25:36.735 --> 25:39.773
So, what you're sayin' is it could
be somethin' shipped by a train

25:39.838 --> 25:42.045
in the next 5 days through
the San Joaquin valley.

25:42.107 --> 25:43.609
I'm afraid so.

25:43.976 --> 25:46.820
I could run a computer check
on all government shipments,

25:46.879 --> 25:49.155
but that would still
leave out corporate transfers

25:49.214 --> 25:50.557
and private citizens.

25:50.616 --> 25:51.856
It's a start.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.839
And what's wrong now?

26:07.166 --> 26:09.203
I can't use the Firm's computers.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.179
The committee would find out what I'm up to

26:11.236 --> 26:13.443
and want to take over the operation.

26:14.373 --> 26:16.284
Maybe that's not such a bad idea.

26:16.341 --> 26:18.150
No, for 2 reasons.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.814
In the past, Maurice has always

26:19.878 --> 26:21.858
been able to catch on to our operations.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.360
I think he has a tap inside the Firm.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.157
You said 2 reasons.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.996
I want him personally.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.825
Besides, I've thought of another
way to get the information.

26:31.890 --> 26:35.463
A little risky, perhaps,
but I'm sure it will work.

26:35.928 --> 26:39.375
You know, you blow this, the
committee is gonna bust your butt.

26:39.865 --> 26:44.041
There's not much use for ex-deputy
directors on the street these days.

26:44.570 --> 26:48.040
Well, I can always buy an ice-cream
truck with one headlight.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.830
Here's the final schedule.

27:19.838 --> 27:22.045
I've done it all, sweetheart.

27:22.374 --> 27:25.548
I've shot film in every part of this world,

27:27.279 --> 27:30.158
under every possible condition.

27:31.183 --> 27:33.891
Did you direct any of the famous stars?

27:34.820 --> 27:37.300
All of them, at one time or another.

27:37.923 --> 27:39.197
Like who?

27:39.358 --> 27:40.530
Flynn.

27:41.760 --> 27:42.932
Wayne.

27:44.396 --> 27:45.568
Fonda.

27:46.698 --> 27:48.109
All of them.

27:49.468 --> 27:51.106
That's wonderful.

27:51.370 --> 27:53.907
Who's in the picture you're making now?

27:54.206 --> 27:55.776
Unknowns.

27:58.744 --> 28:00.621
I'm creating new ones.

28:02.781 --> 28:04.385
Into stars?

28:07.586 --> 28:09.259
Into millionaires.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.735
Oh, you're just fabulous, Mr. Sayes.

28:14.793 --> 28:15.794
Hey, hey…

28:17.629 --> 28:19.199
Call me Simon.

28:21.900 --> 28:25.279
Tell me some more about the
picture you're making now.

28:25.971 --> 28:27.075
Tons of it.

28:27.139 --> 28:30.120
The treasury department transfers
it every year at this time

28:30.175 --> 28:32.917
from regional depositories to Fort Knox.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.453
By train?

28:34.513 --> 28:36.857
Train, plane, truck, whatever.

28:36.915 --> 28:39.395
It's low-profile versus show-of-force.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.453
Different type of security, but it works.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.295
Government's been using it for years.

28:43.355 --> 28:45.266
They've got it down to an effective system.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.395
Obviously, so does Maurice.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.029
I told you he was good.

28:49.094 --> 28:52.234
There are 6 train shipments
scheduled out in the next 4 days

28:52.297 --> 28:56.006
that touch on that 500-mile fuel
radius you specified, Mr. Hawke.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.143
Now Sayes dropped the name
Stoner, we're checking him out.

28:59.204 --> 29:00.808
If he works on one of those runs

29:00.872 --> 29:03.648
or is a dispatcher, he's their inside man.

29:03.709 --> 29:07.122
It might tell us which train
Maurice is planning to hit.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.358
209 out of Bakersfield.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.860
They're all possibilities,
Mr. Hawke. I mean, that is,

29:11.917 --> 29:14.397
unless you possess some sort of ESP.

29:14.620 --> 29:18.124
No, I possess a 4:00am call.

29:18.190 --> 29:21.000
That's the only gold train out of Bakersfield.

29:22.995 --> 29:25.168
I'll arrange for air
surveillance and a strike force.

29:25.230 --> 29:29.770
No, every time I've set a trap for
Maurice, he's managed to slip it.

29:29.835 --> 29:33.180
I have to limit knowledge of this
operation to the people in this room,

29:33.238 --> 29:35.013
at least until he hits the train.

29:35.073 --> 29:36.416
We'll fly cover.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.045
No offense.

29:39.544 --> 29:41.387
I've got someone else in mind.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.481
Who?

29:45.484 --> 29:47.191
You're up late.

29:49.655 --> 29:52.033
That's what it takes to run a business.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.498
What's wrong with it?

29:58.830 --> 30:00.468
Anything over 120 knots,

30:00.532 --> 30:04.105
she starts to vibrate
like a Hotel Street chippie.

30:06.071 --> 30:07.550
Hotel Street?

30:08.774 --> 30:10.151
Honolulu.

30:10.776 --> 30:14.849
Where I once flew combat with your Father.

30:14.913 --> 30:16.392
In World War II, remember?

30:16.481 --> 30:17.926
Yeah, I remember.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.988
What do you want?

30:20.686 --> 30:23.428
I want to talk, not duck punches.

30:23.755 --> 30:25.530
Are you gonna listen?

30:25.590 --> 30:27.934
To what, a list of old age homes?

30:28.560 --> 30:30.198
I need your help.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.537
To gas your chopper, wash your windows?

30:34.333 --> 30:36.370
To back me up on this job.

30:36.702 --> 30:39.945
I'm not gonna follow you around
with a fuel truck either.

30:41.106 --> 30:42.915
How about an Airwolf?

31:15.040 --> 31:16.144
All set?

31:17.542 --> 31:20.250
As soon as your little army
here unloads their weapons.

31:20.312 --> 31:21.848
They're blanks.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.954
If one goes off, it'll still start a fire.

31:25.016 --> 31:26.495
They got 'em on safety.

31:26.551 --> 31:29.532
Good. Unload 'em.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.177
Oh, thanks.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.048
We could fly cover, too, sir.

32:19.104 --> 32:21.380
Hawke wouldn't know until it was over.

32:21.673 --> 32:22.674
No.

32:23.408 --> 32:26.946
He risked losing his only
friend to do this job for me.

32:27.279 --> 32:30.123
I've got to let him play it out on his terms.

32:30.649 --> 32:33.152
I thought you and Hawke were friends.

32:33.652 --> 32:35.063
Hawke and I?

32:36.888 --> 32:39.767
No, we just use each other.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.671
I wouldn't call us friends.

32:44.863 --> 32:46.103
No, sir.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.152
Is that the track our train's on?

33:05.650 --> 33:07.857
Yeah, that's it.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.430
Okay, baby. It's just you and me.

34:55.092 --> 34:57.232
There's a train about 10 miles down there.

34:57.295 --> 34:58.899
Is that the one?

34:59.431 --> 35:01.240
That's the one.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.207
Where's the camera ship?

35:06.404 --> 35:08.406
"Where's the camera ship?"

35:09.874 --> 35:11.251
What's so funny?

35:13.345 --> 35:16.656
Mr. Sayes has a very juvenile
sense of humor, Mr. Hawke.

35:17.382 --> 35:19.259
Drop down 50 feet

35:19.484 --> 35:22.055
and fly a heading of 180.

35:22.821 --> 35:24.357
Now, Mr. Hawke.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.938
Dominic, do you read me?

35:36.001 --> 35:37.412
Loud and clear.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.676
You didn't report on station.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.181
I'm sorry.

35:41.239 --> 35:43.913
I didn't know I was still in the military.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.977
Do you have them in sight?

35:46.411 --> 35:49.085
Negative. But I got the train spotted.

35:49.381 --> 35:50.985
They should be there by now.

35:51.049 --> 35:52.494
Well, they' re not.

35:53.184 --> 35:55.323
Are you sure it's the right train?

36:11.703 --> 36:13.842
Did he really call you that?

36:25.617 --> 36:27.790
There it is. Right on time.

36:30.922 --> 36:33.061
That's your target, Mr. Hawke.

36:36.361 --> 36:39.399
If he slows down or speeds
up, we'll all be dead.

36:39.464 --> 36:41.307
Then let's hope he doesn't.

36:43.368 --> 36:46.474
Express 1, this is Stoner.
You still on schedule?

36:46.538 --> 36:47.539
That's a 10-4.

36:47.605 --> 36:49.243
Just entered the Mojave straightaway.

36:50.475 --> 36:53.922
I wasn't sure. Our speedometer
here shows you're down to 42.

36:53.978 --> 36:57.084
You know your alarm goes
off at 40 miles an hour.

36:57.248 --> 37:00.593
Something's wrong. My
speedometer is reading 55.

37:00.652 --> 37:03.360
Probably needs recalibration.
I'll tell you what.

37:03.421 --> 37:06.027
Why don't you nail it to 60
for the next couple of minutes

37:06.091 --> 37:07.695
and hold it steady?

37:07.759 --> 37:09.033
That's a 10-4.

38:55.600 --> 38:56.840
Okay, boys…

39:01.472 --> 39:02.917
They've got to be there.

39:02.974 --> 39:05.955
Well, come up here and see for yourself.

39:06.778 --> 39:09.224
Sir, Stoner isn't with any railroad.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.123
Meryl, we've got a slightly larger problem

39:11.182 --> 39:13.594
than locating Maurice's inside man.

39:14.018 --> 39:17.431
But, sir, he is a dispatcher
with Hi-Desert Trucking.

39:17.789 --> 39:20.463
They ship gold for the government, too.

39:40.245 --> 39:42.088
Got her, Mr. Maurice.

39:42.413 --> 39:44.950
Then we no longer need you, Mr. Hawke.

39:56.494 --> 39:57.996
He's got to be dead.

39:58.596 --> 40:01.805
Don't worry. I can fly her off of here.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.875
I'm bettin' our lives on that, Vinnie.

40:26.624 --> 40:28.695
You've got to get there faster.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.036
I'm flying her as fast as I can.

40:31.562 --> 40:33.337
What's your air speed, Dominic?

40:33.398 --> 40:34.934
250 knots.

40:34.999 --> 40:37.275
He's not using the turbo thrusters.

40:37.335 --> 40:39.872
He can't, he'd never be
able to control Airwolf.

40:40.738 --> 40:43.218
Oh, what the hell, you only live once.

42:03.454 --> 42:06.230
Well, you sure took your
sweet time getting here.

42:06.290 --> 42:10.067
Sweet time? You're lucky I got here at all.

42:10.595 --> 42:13.098
You were supposed to be
robbin' a railroad, remember?

42:13.164 --> 42:16.338
If Archangel hadn't found out
about some guy named Stoner

42:16.401 --> 42:19.109
working for Hi-Desert Trucking Company,

42:19.504 --> 42:22.007
I'd still be followin' a train to Bakersfield.

42:22.106 --> 42:23.107
Hey, Dom.

42:23.875 --> 42:24.876
Yeah?

42:25.276 --> 42:26.755
Nice landing.

42:33.284 --> 42:35.958
Give me full power, both turbos.

42:36.087 --> 42:37.725
We got some catching up to do.

42:37.789 --> 42:39.268
You got it.

42:47.465 --> 42:49.445
That's it, Mr. Maurice.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.844
We can't lift off with any more.

42:52.103 --> 42:56.245
Vinnie, how much do Sayes and Miller weigh?

42:56.307 --> 42:58.014
About 8 to 10 bars.

42:58.276 --> 42:59.949
Let's make it 10.

43:05.950 --> 43:07.861
Got a blip 5 miles ahead.

43:13.057 --> 43:14.627
Just a few more minutes, guys

43:14.692 --> 43:16.729
and you can pull over to the side of the road

43:16.794 --> 43:19.070
of the road and throw up if you want to.

43:24.936 --> 43:26.938
Hey! Hey, you can't leave me here!

43:32.110 --> 43:34.613
I believe Mr. Sayes had an accident, Vinnie.

43:53.564 --> 43:56.807
Aren't you gonna notify the
authorities, Mr. Stoner?

44:03.341 --> 44:05.252
2 minutes ahead of schedule.

44:05.776 --> 44:09.383
Very nice. Very nice, indeed.

44:16.454 --> 44:18.092
What the hell was that?

44:20.525 --> 44:22.402
You want chain guns?

44:22.460 --> 44:23.564
No.

44:29.033 --> 44:30.034
Vinnie!

45:10.608 --> 45:12.952
He's crazy! He's going to kill us.

45:15.379 --> 45:16.824
Do something.

45:16.881 --> 45:18.656
Sure, I will. I've had enough.

45:24.455 --> 45:26.594
Give me the chain guns, now!

45:27.191 --> 45:28.534
Hawke, you can't.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.234
Chain guns.

45:35.366 --> 45:36.777
You got it.

46:53.044 --> 46:54.318
Come on!

47:01.652 --> 47:03.495
String, don't do it.

47:11.896 --> 47:13.375
No!

47:14.365 --> 47:15.639
Please don't!

47:16.801 --> 47:18.303
That's enough!

47:37.755 --> 47:42.534
Michael, I've got Maurice and a
friend, packaged and ready for you.

47:42.593 --> 47:43.628
Good job.

47:43.694 --> 47:45.970
Shall I pick 'em up, or will you bring 'em in?

47:46.030 --> 47:48.203
We only gift-wrap. We don't deliver.

47:58.376 --> 48:01.050
What's the rush? Too much for you?

48:02.146 --> 48:03.921
Supposed to be exercise.

48:03.981 --> 48:05.722
We already had the war.

48:05.783 --> 48:08.764
Come on, come on, this old man ain't done yet.

48:10.287 --> 48:12.324
Did I ever call you that?

48:12.923 --> 48:15.164
No, but you made me feel like it.

48:16.093 --> 48:17.538
Now, Dom,

48:18.496 --> 48:20.806
you made yourself feel like that.

48:22.933 --> 48:25.174
What, are you quittin' on me?

48:25.269 --> 48:26.509
Maybe.

48:27.405 --> 48:28.713
And maybe not.

48:32.510 --> 48:34.285
You know, Dominic,

48:35.246 --> 48:37.783
you've always been younger than me.
