02:29.358 --> 02:31.400
It was kicking again.

02:32.069 --> 02:37.240
"The baby" was kicking. You said, "it."

02:41.912 --> 02:43.204
I want to go out.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.289
We've discussed this.

02:46.041 --> 02:50.586
That neighbor lady came by yesterday.

02:50.963 --> 02:53.381
- She invited us for dinner.
- She came here?

02:53.465 --> 02:55.758
Well, it's not like we've got a phone.

02:55.843 --> 02:59.345
I asked you not to allow anyone in here. I pay you for it.

02:59.429 --> 03:03.724
A simple dinner, some conversation,

03:04.101 --> 03:07.603
some music, for God's sake.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.814
They have a W-80.

03:10.774 --> 03:11.774
I don't know what that is.

03:12.067 --> 03:16.821
A Victrola. You don't hear Jolson from across the alley?

03:26.790 --> 03:28.791
I'll be working late.

03:30.043 --> 03:33.629
This is a jail, Nelson.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.173
I used to be out every night in the week.

03:36.633 --> 03:41.220
Yes, I'm sure between ordering murders and rigging elections,

03:41.305 --> 03:43.598
Nucky Thompson showed you quite a time.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.391
I can't live like this!

03:45.475 --> 03:51.564
And once the child is born, you won't have to.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.108
That was the agreement.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.861
Please make sure you eat.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.700
Say what you want about Nucky,

04:03.160 --> 04:06.078
at least he was fun.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.766
I've had Katy return a few of my things to The Belle Femme.

04:26.850 --> 04:30.269
The brocade coat, the flower pendant necklace...

04:30.354 --> 04:32.104
What? What for?

04:32.814 --> 04:37.234
- I don't need them.
- But you wanted them.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.613
Under the circumstances,

04:40.697 --> 04:43.282
I thought it might be wise to conserve our resources.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.786
Under the circumstances, it's more important than ever

04:46.870 --> 04:49.121
for it to appear as though nothing has changed.

04:49.581 --> 04:52.041
Are you not invested to the limit in your land deal?

04:55.212 --> 04:57.463
I heard you on the telephone with your lawyer.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.715
I want you only in your finest things.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.596
I sleep late, you know that.

05:06.181 --> 05:11.352
I said nothing. These are, after all, your finest silk pajamas.

05:11.895 --> 05:15.314
Send the girl to get your things back.

05:16.858 --> 05:21.070
We'll be fine, Margaret. We are fine.

05:48.682 --> 05:53.686
Fucking Chinamen last night. Spilled coffee all over the felt.

05:55.147 --> 05:57.273
You let chinks play in here?

06:05.365 --> 06:07.992
- What's this?
- It's light, I know.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.493
Light? It's a fucking dirigible.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.829
You're getting a lot of use out of that line, I bet.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.290
- What am I supposed to tell Nucky?
- Tell him I don't know.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.834
But you can ask him why I had to hire this mick

06:16.918 --> 06:18.836
when I ain't got no booze to sell.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.796
You're evading the issue, Lolly.

06:21.339 --> 06:25.092
Let me tell you about the casino business, Damien.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.844
People gamble.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.263
They lose, they get mad,

06:29.347 --> 06:33.726
so we give 'em free drinks so they keep gambling.

06:33.810 --> 06:38.606
Sometimes they win, they get happy, so we give 'em more free drinks.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.900
Then they're drunk,

06:40.984 --> 06:44.862
so they gamble even more and eventually they lose it all.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.616
The next night they come back and do it all over again.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.911
So the whole fucking equation depends on what?

06:52.996 --> 06:53.996
Alcohol.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.664
You just got a load last month!

06:55.749 --> 06:59.168
Of the cheap shit, the swill, and I'm even running low on that.

06:59.461 --> 07:02.797
The rollers want the good stuff. We ain't got it, they play someplace else.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.174
It's hard, Lolly. Nuck's fighting for his life.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.635
We're all fighting for our lives.

07:07.719 --> 07:12.598
He wants fat envelopes? I'm gonna need the booze from him.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.558
Or from somebody else.

07:22.526 --> 07:24.193
Same route, same order.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.945
Hell, it's even the same fellas meeting you on shore.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.697
- It's a passing of the mantle.
- Sure.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.200
Back to the fella already passed it to Nucky.

07:32.911 --> 07:37.164
I'll be buying my liquor somewhere, Captain. Might as well be from Bill McCoy.

07:38.250 --> 07:41.627
So it's not so much you want to buy from me as you don't want me selling to Nucky.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.587
That needn't concern you.

07:43.672 --> 07:46.298
Ah, but the enemy of my friend...

07:46.383 --> 07:48.592
I believe you have that backwards, Mr. McCoy.

07:49.886 --> 07:53.722
- Feeling flush, are you?
- God bless Mr. Volstead.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.851
Halibut and motor oil, that's what he used to smell like.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.519
Now he's a fucking big shot.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.437
Your attempt at charm, Lou?

08:00.647 --> 08:03.482
My attempt to talk sense to a jackass.

08:03.567 --> 08:04.692
I thought you made a deal,

08:05.152 --> 08:06.819
you and Nucky, years ago.

08:06.903 --> 08:07.987
Didn't like the terms.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.489
So he bested you in the bargain and now you're fucking him over.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.324
Let's keep the conversation civil, huh?

08:12.409 --> 08:14.577
- Just politics, Bill.
- Or mutiny.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.413
Depending which business you're in.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.082
Giving me the stink-eye for?

08:21.626 --> 08:25.504
Captain? That lighthouse out there,

08:25.630 --> 08:28.048
the beacon that guides you?

08:28.133 --> 08:29.967
Don't you forget who put it there.

08:31.970 --> 08:35.806
That scotch in your hand that warms your winter nights?

08:35.890 --> 08:38.433
Don't you forget who put it there.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.899
- Now what?
- All right, get on the phone.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.610
Get Tony Dennehy at the Coast Guard.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.869
Nucky, I am so sorry. I was watering the plants.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.955
- He let himself in.
- Who did?

09:11.635 --> 09:13.677
Mr. Thompson.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.347
Torrio's man.

09:19.601 --> 09:22.561
- AI Capone.
- Right.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.397
- Brew some coffee.
- Immediately.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.816
I was not expecting you until later.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.818
- No excuses, just coffee.
- Ja.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.454
- Sorry for barging in.
- It's been a busy time.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.122
I haven't been able to get the maid in here lately.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.875
My office is in a cathouse.

09:47.545 --> 09:48.754
What brings you to Atlantic City?

09:49.047 --> 09:53.717
A message from Johnny Torrio. He wanted you to hear it personally.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.428
So he sends you.

09:56.680 --> 10:00.474
I was coming this way anyhow. My father died.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.893
I'm settling his affairs. He got a barbershop over...

10:02.978 --> 10:04.603
What's the message?

10:08.525 --> 10:10.317
With regret,

10:10.402 --> 10:13.404
Chicago will no longer be buying alcohol from Atlantic City.

10:16.116 --> 10:20.452
Look, whatever Mr. Torrio may have heard about my position here,

10:20.537 --> 10:22.288
you can assure him that all is well.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.249
- Meaning what exactly?
- That I'd expect a man of his caliber

10:25.333 --> 10:27.334
not to cut and run at the first sign of trouble.

10:27.961 --> 10:32.381
I don't know what you're talking about. Truth is, this is nothing personal.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.466
Torrio's got a new supplier.

10:34.551 --> 10:35.759
What, did I say that?

10:35.844 --> 10:37.469
Don't get cute.

10:37.554 --> 10:42.266
New York? Philly? Is it Waxey Gordon?

10:45.228 --> 10:47.062
Unless he's getting out of the liquor business entirely,

10:47.147 --> 10:48.814
- I'm gonna find out.
- He ain't.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.733
So is he distilling it from Lake Michigan, what?

10:50.817 --> 10:52.484
You're getting warmer.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.487
Some Jews across the lake, they're shipping it direct.

10:56.031 --> 10:59.074
- Canada?
- With your pal George Remus in Ohio.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.496
He knew you'd be taking a hit.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.082
A token of goodwill.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.505
What should I tell him?

11:13.923 --> 11:16.759
Tell him, "No, thank you."

11:16.843 --> 11:19.428
Next time he has something to tell me in person,

11:19.512 --> 11:22.222
I'd like to hear it in person.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.270
Fair enough.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.274
How's Jimmy Irish?

11:33.443 --> 11:37.237
If you're referring to Jimmy Darmody, you'll have to ask him.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.114
He's moving up in the world, huh?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.911
Tough out there, Chicago? The liquor trade?

11:44.371 --> 11:48.791
It's tough all over, I'd imagine. There's a lot of dough at stake.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.709
How's Torrio handling the competition?

11:52.170 --> 11:54.171
We're killing 'em.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.427
Did you have trouble finding me?

12:00.804 --> 12:05.140
Why, I asked a fella for directions, he said, "Leave town and don't look back."

12:05.225 --> 12:07.184
Oh, no!

12:17.654 --> 12:22.157
The good stuff, straight from Broadway.

12:25.912 --> 12:31.083
It was a joke, peaches. I was kidding. Ocean City's fine.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.626
It's not that.

12:32.710 --> 12:38.090
It's just seeing you reminds me of everything I'm missing.

12:38.842 --> 12:44.263
Missing? You're not missing a thing, kid. A baby, that's the ticket.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.392
I tell you, Ida and the girls make life worth living.

12:48.810 --> 12:52.521
Papa, whoever he is, oh, wait till he gets a load of that kisser.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.528
He's married.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.198
Mr. Mueller?

13:03.283 --> 13:06.910
- Who?
- The name on the mailbox.

13:08.580 --> 13:14.460
That's not his name. He's some prohi I met in a speak.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.212
You met a prohi in a speak?

13:17.547 --> 13:19.423
Oh.

13:27.182 --> 13:31.226
After Nucky threw me over, I didn't care.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.646
I wasn't careful.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.274
Then the next thing I knew...

13:40.778 --> 13:44.781
He said he'd pay me...

13:44.866 --> 13:47.117
Good money.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.497
Take care of me until the baby comes.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.749
You should've written you were short on dough.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.833
No,

13:55.376 --> 13:56.585
it's just...

13:56.669 --> 14:02.382
Oh, it's just that I wanted to...

14:02.467 --> 14:05.385
...be important to somebody.

14:05.470 --> 14:06.970
I wanted...

14:07.680 --> 14:12.768
I wanted to mean something besides just whoopee.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.269
You know?

14:18.608 --> 14:20.025
Does Nucky know?

14:20.735 --> 14:23.153
He knows about everything else,

14:23.404 --> 14:26.573
I wouldn't be surprised.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.039
So tell me about Vaudeville.

14:34.457 --> 14:37.793
- What's the gossip?
- You mean besides you?

14:39.170 --> 14:40.337
We're dead for winter

14:40.421 --> 14:43.757
and MacGregor's coming into the Apollo with this snoozer.

14:44.175 --> 14:47.261
A showgirl wants to marry a society boy,

14:47.428 --> 14:49.930
but his parents won't...

14:55.979 --> 15:00.607
- Is it that bad?
- Huh, huh? What? Oh.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.610
It's not that terrible, I suppose.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.362
Hmm.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.951
"A Dangerous Maid."

15:37.186 --> 15:39.104
Ange?

15:49.532 --> 15:52.242
- Daddy!
- Jimmy.

15:52.327 --> 15:53.535
Here they are.

15:55.663 --> 15:56.788
Mutt and mutt.

15:57.624 --> 15:58.707
What are you doing here?

15:59.083 --> 16:00.125
Hey.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.337
- Thank heavens.
- Hey, watch the lamp!

16:04.547 --> 16:07.633
Tommy, get him, get him! Get him!

16:09.552 --> 16:10.552
Get him!

16:10.845 --> 16:12.054
Tommy...

16:14.390 --> 16:17.434
- All he's gotta do is step aside.
- Naturally.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.312
Like Colosimo. Bang!

16:21.230 --> 16:24.066
That's not how we're working it. It's a political coup.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.277
- A what?
- We're taking back the city.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.071
My father used to run things here.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.406
Fuck the city. What about the booze?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.283
We got it all locked up. We got the...

16:33.368 --> 16:37.412
The Coast Guard in our pocket and Nucky will be in jail by fall.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.998
Jail?

16:40.083 --> 16:43.001
Just have Frankenstein drill a hole in his noggin.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.213
I won't do that.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.257
What do you mean, "won't"?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.097
So how about you?

16:55.765 --> 16:57.265
You still at the Deuces?

16:57.350 --> 17:01.561
Torrio gave me a piece. The brewery, too. 20% of each.

17:01.646 --> 17:04.690
I bought a house. I'm moving my brothers out from Brooklyn.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.526
So we're both cooking with gas.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.367
I wish I knew you were coming. I would have baked something myself.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.328
No, this is great. Perfetto.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.498
Are you staying for dinner as well?

17:21.582 --> 17:23.875
No, I got a train for Brooklyn.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.337
My father passed a few weeks back. I'm settling his affairs.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.340
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:30.425 --> 17:33.343
He was a barber, had his own shop.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.512
Not like your father, but he did okay.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.682
Thought I'd be a barber, too.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.810
Can you see that?

17:43.813 --> 17:45.147
It's an honest living.

17:45.732 --> 17:49.818
And it worked him to death like a chump. But he was my father, right?

18:02.999 --> 18:04.624
I marry a mick, you marry a dago,

18:05.168 --> 18:08.170
and we both got sons. What's that about?

18:08.504 --> 18:11.298
- Daddy, my shoes won't tie.
- What?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.675
My shoes won't tie!

18:14.677 --> 18:16.344
I'll be right back.

18:18.306 --> 18:20.182
They won't tie, huh?

18:20.391 --> 18:23.101
You don't remember what I showed you?

18:24.395 --> 18:25.937
Watch Daddy's leg.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.982
- Looped.
- Loop, okay.

18:29.066 --> 18:32.944
- Wrap, put it through, pull it tight.
- Like that?

18:33.029 --> 18:34.196
- Yes.
- Okay.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.032
- Looped, wrap it around...
- One? Two?

18:37.116 --> 18:39.034
- No, one loop.
- Two loops?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.369
- No, one loop!
- Three loop. Then...

18:41.537 --> 18:42.537
Wrap it around. No.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.956
How is Odette?

18:45.583 --> 18:46.583
Who?

18:46.667 --> 18:48.794
- Put the string in between.
- In between.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.922
- And pull tight.
- Pull it tight.

18:52.006 --> 18:55.550
She's a whore. That's how she is.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.302
You know how to do it better than I do.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.763
You just like... You just like it when I do it.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.058
Daddy, Daddy!

19:03.142 --> 19:05.268
- Hey, hey!
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

19:05.728 --> 19:07.687
- I need your help...
- Daddy, Daddy!

19:07.772 --> 19:10.023
Can I just get my coat off at least?

19:10.107 --> 19:14.236
Your father's agitated or something. He won't let me shave him, change his bed.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.363
Leave him be, he's comfortable.

19:16.489 --> 19:21.743
It's days now he's sleeping in his clothes. He'll get bedsores.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.550
Hey, Pop.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.513
Time to go to sleep.

19:41.597 --> 19:44.850
Look who's here. The big shot.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.902
Come on, let's get you changed, okay?

19:57.154 --> 19:59.906
Here, this bullshit.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.076
What they're trying to do?

20:03.160 --> 20:04.703
You shouldn't read that. Here.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.705
It's a lot of goddamn bullshit.

20:06.789 --> 20:08.665
- I know.
- What?

20:08.749 --> 20:13.545
- Let's get you cleaned up, okay?
- I gotta be ready in case he needs me.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.213
- Who?
- Your brother!

20:17.550 --> 20:22.470
Well, to do that you're gonna need your rest, okay?

20:22.555 --> 20:25.557
So here, come on.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.102
What'll become of him?

20:29.186 --> 20:31.396
He's a big boy, Pop. He'll take care of himself.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.899
Bullshit.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.485
- Pop, come on. Quit squirming.
- You need to help him.

20:37.904 --> 20:42.449
You can handle things, but Eli? He has no goddamn idea what he's doing.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.245
Mr. Thompson.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.377
Good night.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.065
You're up.

21:58.401 --> 22:01.569
I am. How was your day?

22:02.029 --> 22:03.697
It was good.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.784
Chalky White's gonna make bail. He'll be home very soon.

22:07.868 --> 22:11.204
Oh. His family must be thrilled.

22:15.793 --> 22:16.793
You all right?

22:18.462 --> 22:19.462
I'm fine.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.717
You look... I don't know.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.219
The book maybe.

22:42.945 --> 22:45.280
So are you going to tell me what's going on or not?

22:50.286 --> 22:52.454
Is it only me who has to share their troubles?

22:53.080 --> 22:54.497
What do you mean?

22:54.582 --> 22:58.293
You walk around, the weight of the world on your shoulders,

22:58.377 --> 23:00.128
yet you pretend nothing's wrong.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.714
I'll do the worrying for the both of us.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.507
I want to help you.

23:04.925 --> 23:08.053
You do. You are.

23:12.808 --> 23:15.518
I've told you of my brother and sisters in Ireland.

23:16.312 --> 23:17.395
Yes?

23:21.108 --> 23:23.818
They're here now, in Brooklyn.

23:42.046 --> 23:44.422
There's a resemblance.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.721
There's a telephone number.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.642
What are you going to do?

23:56.852 --> 23:58.019
I don't know.

23:59.814 --> 24:03.274
It wasn't a happy parting of the ways.

24:06.862 --> 24:11.282
This business, when it all blows over? I'd like to take you away.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.535
Have you seen Paris?

24:14.203 --> 24:15.203
No.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.790
Then that's where we'll go. The kids, too, if you like.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.376
We'll book a suite at the Meurice.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.671
- I'm quite happy here, you know.
- I'm very glad to hear that.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.591
But it's important to always have something to look forward to.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.812
The whole encounter will be balanced on a razor.

24:40.896 --> 24:44.899
Take your father's lead, but be your own man as well.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.860
So I shouldn't let him cut my meat for me?

24:48.237 --> 24:49.946
I'm glad you're so cavalier.

24:50.156 --> 24:54.325
- It's just a dinner, Ma.
- With the governor, dear.

24:54.410 --> 24:58.163
Your father's worked very hard to solidify this relationship.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.748
And you know what they say about first impressions.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.628
You used to call him "the Letch."

25:05.713 --> 25:07.297
- Who?
- My father.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.257
I did not.

25:09.383 --> 25:12.093
You did. I had to look it up.

25:13.095 --> 25:17.348
Well, it must have been when I was still angry with him.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.017
And what's changed?

25:20.895 --> 25:22.562
I grew up.

25:22.897 --> 25:26.107
I learned forgiveness.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.193
It is a virtue, you know.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.904
By that logic I should forgive Nucky.

25:30.988 --> 25:32.363
Forgive Nucky for what?

25:32.448 --> 25:33.990
Nothing.

25:45.669 --> 25:49.589
It means everything that you stood up for my honor, dear.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.135
I was a mere child when Nucky brought me to your father.

25:55.471 --> 25:57.138
You're certainly right about that.

25:58.515 --> 26:03.228
- What's with his hair?
- Getting old is no picnic, believe me.

26:03.312 --> 26:04.479
It looks foolish.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.606
To you, maybe.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.234
To the outside world, he just looks like the Commodore.

26:12.363 --> 26:16.199
A friend of mine buried his father.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.494
He was a barber.

26:20.329 --> 26:21.788
Oh?

26:23.290 --> 26:26.542
Sometimes I think I'd be better suited to a simpler life.

26:26.919 --> 26:31.047
Well, that's ridiculous. You're a natural leader.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.343
And what are you?

26:37.805 --> 26:41.349
I'm just a woman who loves her family.

26:46.855 --> 26:51.317
"I know what everybody says about me behind my back.

26:51.402 --> 26:57.573
"That I'm just some flibbertigibbet with cotton wool between the ears.

26:57.658 --> 27:01.869
"Well, I'm wise to a thing or two, I guess.

27:04.206 --> 27:09.711
"You think I'll fall for any old bean with pomade in his hair

27:09.795 --> 27:13.298
"and the keys to a coupe?

27:13.382 --> 27:18.344
"And maybe I would have last month,

27:18.429 --> 27:23.725
"but now I'm in love with Harry.

27:24.893 --> 27:29.439
"So what if I don't know how to hit a ball with a stick on a horse,

27:29.523 --> 27:32.400
"or laugh without showing my teeth?

27:33.944 --> 27:37.363
"I love him and he loves me.

27:37.489 --> 27:41.284
"And whether we wind up in some swank mansion

27:41.368 --> 27:44.078
- "or just in a tarpaper shack..."
- What are you doing?

27:51.420 --> 27:53.338
Nothing.

27:58.886 --> 28:00.094
Please.

28:07.436 --> 28:08.436
What is this?

28:09.063 --> 28:11.481
What's it look like? A script.

28:12.274 --> 28:13.608
Why were you reading it?

28:17.404 --> 28:22.116
My friend Eddie came over today...

28:22.201 --> 28:23.618
Eddie Cantor.

28:24.078 --> 28:28.790
He's a performer. I've seen his name. What did you discuss?

28:30.000 --> 28:33.252
Only that there's a musical trying out in town.

28:33.337 --> 28:35.630
And he thinks... Eddie...

28:35.714 --> 28:39.550
He thinks I'd be good for the part. A chorus girl.

28:39.635 --> 28:45.973
In the story, she's a chorus girl who gets jammed up with the wrong guy.

28:48.644 --> 28:52.522
Everything written here is what the actors are supposed to say?

28:54.149 --> 28:55.942
Ain't you ever seen a show?

28:59.905 --> 29:01.114
Hey, give that...

29:01.198 --> 29:05.785
I was taken by an aunt to a Christmas pageant in 1894.

29:05.869 --> 29:08.579
When my parents found out, they broke off all relations

29:08.664 --> 29:10.665
and never spoke to her again.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.292
Well, you don't know what you're missing.

29:16.797 --> 29:19.632
You wish to appear in this spectacle?

29:20.426 --> 29:22.552
Please speak up.

29:24.304 --> 29:27.932
Yes! Yes, I wish to appear.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.851
I need something,

29:30.686 --> 29:34.981
something or I'm going to go crazy.

29:35.065 --> 29:37.024
But you realize that's not possible.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.317
You're carrying a child.

29:38.402 --> 29:42.655
That is a sacred charge from the Lord and a financial agreement between us.

29:43.157 --> 29:47.743
So what you might want can't be allowed.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.463
I'm sorry.

30:08.724 --> 30:10.892
I told him, Nuck. I hollered and everything.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.018
And he said what?

30:12.102 --> 30:14.896
That without the hooch, people don't gamble as much.

30:15.105 --> 30:18.399
We got three boats coming in tonight. Scotch, rum and rye.

30:18.484 --> 30:19.484
Tell him to keep his shirt on.

30:20.736 --> 30:22.612
The Attorney General is on the line.

30:35.167 --> 30:39.337
This isn't to be critical, but you need to start picking up on people's signals.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.506
Okay, Nuck.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.299
I need to take this call, Damien.

30:45.093 --> 30:48.012
Right. Yes, I'm so sorry.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.348
So sorry.

30:57.064 --> 30:58.272
Mr. Attorney General.

30:58.649 --> 31:02.610
Why so formal? The only thing new is the title.

31:02.903 --> 31:04.487
How are you settling in, Harry?

31:04.571 --> 31:08.074
Warren had to have the place fumigated. Seriously,

31:08.158 --> 31:09.825
the White House? It's filthy.

31:09.952 --> 31:12.203
Not nearly as dirty as when you fellas get through with it.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.956
What can I do for you, Nuck?

31:15.290 --> 31:18.459
Well, speaking of messes, I'm in one myself.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.670
You hear about this election nonsense they're throwing at me?

31:20.796 --> 31:23.923
I read the papers, sure. At least my clerk does it for me.

31:24.091 --> 31:25.758
Well, not to put too fine a point on it,

31:25.842 --> 31:28.511
but if you were ever planning on making good on a certain debt,

31:28.804 --> 31:30.346
now would be the time.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.807
Hey, you leave a case of wine on top of a radiator?

31:33.058 --> 31:34.976
- Come on.
- What?

31:35.060 --> 31:37.979
- Sorry, Nuck.
- I say I'm calling in a favor.

31:38.146 --> 31:41.649
- I heard you, I just... I don't know.
- You don't know what?

31:41.942 --> 31:43.276
I hope it's how to thank me

31:43.360 --> 31:46.112
and not whether a bastard kid would've cost your boy the election.

31:46.363 --> 31:49.198
Don't get me wrong, Nucky, we're all very grateful,

31:49.283 --> 31:51.033
but yours was a state election.

31:51.326 --> 31:52.493
- So?
- So, I have

31:52.578 --> 31:54.412
no standing to intervene on federal level.

31:54.663 --> 31:57.248
- You can't get Harding to pull some strings?
- Tell you what,

31:57.541 --> 31:59.208
how about you come down for a visit?

31:59.293 --> 32:00.918
My guest, you and your gal,

32:01.003 --> 32:03.170
dinner at the White House. Stay over if you like.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.673
I know Warren would love to see you. How does that sound?

32:05.757 --> 32:07.258
It sounds like you're fucking me over.

32:07.509 --> 32:09.510
Let me unpack my socks at least, will you?

32:09.636 --> 32:12.847
Swell, Harry. In the meantime, I'll try to stay out of jail.

32:26.737 --> 32:28.446
Meyer, Charlie,

32:28.530 --> 32:31.782
I believe you know Mr. Masseria.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.619
- Sure...
- Everybody knows Joe The Boss.

32:40.917 --> 32:43.252
Then perhaps you also know,

32:43.587 --> 32:46.380
though it is, of course, news to me,

32:46.465 --> 32:49.467
that a card game you operate is located in territory

32:49.551 --> 32:53.262
that Mr. Masseria considers to be his.

32:53.513 --> 32:56.891
Not considers! Is mine.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.645
My thinking was,

33:00.729 --> 33:04.815
before any more blood is shed, that a compromise can be reached.

33:04.900 --> 33:05.900
More blood?

33:05.984 --> 33:09.779
Tompkins Square Park, my two nephews?

33:14.534 --> 33:15.660
I don't know what you're talking about.

33:15.744 --> 33:19.372
Apparently two of Mr. Masseria's emissaries to your establishment

33:19.456 --> 33:22.208
were murdered shortly after their visit.

33:24.211 --> 33:25.836
We do operate a game

33:25.921 --> 33:28.464
in what might be termed a gray area territorially,

33:28.548 --> 33:30.466
but as to any violence in the neighborhood...

33:30.550 --> 33:31.509
They stab themself, huh?

33:31.593 --> 33:33.177
It's a coincidence, then. It happens.

33:33.261 --> 33:35.262
On my streets,

33:35.931 --> 33:37.765
no coincidence.

33:38.392 --> 33:39.392
Now this little prick,

33:39.476 --> 33:42.937
since he's 10 years old he causes problems.

33:47.275 --> 33:51.612
It seems to me you boys ought to extend a token of goodwill towards Mr. Masseria.

33:53.073 --> 33:54.198
Shall we say

33:55.075 --> 33:59.453
a one-time fee of $2,000 for the families of those gentlemen

34:00.038 --> 34:03.999
and a tax of 10% on the game going forward?

34:04.084 --> 34:05.126
Hold on a fucking second...

34:05.210 --> 34:06.293
Charlie.

34:11.091 --> 34:14.844
10% is okay...

34:15.137 --> 34:16.137
...for now.

34:16.638 --> 34:19.598
Then we have an agreement?

34:39.828 --> 34:41.954
What are you doing with these Christ-killers?

34:42.164 --> 34:44.956
Come with me, I'll make you rich.

34:46.001 --> 34:48.835
With your other hand in my pocket.

34:51.672 --> 34:56.092
I'm watching you boy.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.845
Charlie.

35:09.733 --> 35:13.569
A.R., two grand is bad enough, but 10% of the fucking game?

35:13.862 --> 35:16.655
We already pay half the take on that game to you.

35:18.867 --> 35:19.950
Yes.

35:20.744 --> 35:23.370
And now you boys know why.

35:34.758 --> 35:36.425
There's another speak off Baltic.

35:36.510 --> 35:39.720
Right time of night, you'll be good for 100 cases.

35:39.846 --> 35:42.473
What kind of security, Mr. Cusick?

35:43.225 --> 35:44.350
The usual...

35:44.559 --> 35:48.979
Shotguns, pistols. And the name is Doyle now.

35:49.064 --> 35:50.314
Your file says "Cusick."

35:50.565 --> 35:52.483
Then it's wrong,

35:52.567 --> 35:54.485
'cause I already been arrested under the new moniker.

35:55.362 --> 35:57.988
I can arrest you again if you like, see if it sticks.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.574
Cusick'll be dandy.

36:02.786 --> 36:04.328
Cash up front, Officer.

36:05.497 --> 36:08.457
You wanna dance, you pay the piper.

36:11.002 --> 36:14.213
Any chance you wanna sell back any hooch you might happen to confiscate?

36:15.090 --> 36:17.967
Are you admitting to me that you're a bootlegger, Mr. Cusick?

36:22.097 --> 36:24.014
Jesus, I can't get a bead on you.

36:28.270 --> 36:29.311
So, that's what you like.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.230
Can't fault you there.

36:31.314 --> 36:34.191
I'm a married man. I have no interest in women of that sort.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.736
"Treat a queen like a whore

36:37.988 --> 36:40.072
"and a whore like a queen."

36:42.117 --> 36:45.035
That's what my Uncle Louie used to say.

36:48.290 --> 36:52.209
Let me ask you, Mr. Doyle,

36:52.294 --> 36:55.796
would you consider Nucky Thompson fun?

37:31.583 --> 37:35.753
- For whom should I ask?
- Any occupant of apartment 2A.

37:36.546 --> 37:39.089
- I don't often speak on the telephone...
- Just relax.

37:39.174 --> 37:40.633
I told you what to say.

37:41.051 --> 37:42.760
Hello.

37:42.844 --> 37:47.014
Yes. Any occupant of apartment 2A, please.

37:49.893 --> 37:53.103
Yes, very good. He'll fetch someone.

37:56.358 --> 37:59.985
- Is it a friend you're looking for?
- A relation.

38:00.070 --> 38:01.987
In America? Are they...

38:02.364 --> 38:03.989
Yes, hello.

38:04.074 --> 38:06.784
I am attempting to locate Miss Peggy Rohan,

38:06.868 --> 38:08.327
and I wondered if I...

38:11.206 --> 38:15.000
Yes, I see.

38:15.085 --> 38:17.336
And you're quite sure of this?

38:18.838 --> 38:19.838
I'm terribly sorry.

38:25.929 --> 38:29.223
A second man... The man the first man went to fetch?

38:29.307 --> 38:30.307
He says...

38:31.184 --> 38:33.644
I'm sorry,

38:33.728 --> 38:36.188
but he says Peggy Rohan is dead, ma'am.

38:37.524 --> 38:40.234
He said she died 12 years ago.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.085
Mayor Bader dropped by.

38:58.169 --> 39:01.714
He invited you to join him and Mrs. Bader for dinner.

39:01.798 --> 39:05.342
- Tell him I'm busy.
- Anything specific?

39:05.427 --> 39:07.428
- Just make something up.
- Ja.

39:07.512 --> 39:08.554
Oh!

39:12.100 --> 39:14.351
I was wondering why the phone had not rung.

39:14.561 --> 39:15.644
Just leave it.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.315
Mr. Thompson, I do hope I'm not intruding.

39:22.235 --> 39:23.235
What do you want?

39:23.403 --> 39:26.030
A word, if you've time, sir.

39:28.074 --> 39:29.366
Have a seat.

39:34.289 --> 39:35.497
Thanks.

39:49.179 --> 39:52.139
As you know, sir, I've... And I'm eternally grateful...

39:52.223 --> 39:54.725
I've been tending bar for Mr. Steinman at the casino there.

39:55.727 --> 39:56.727
Tonight.

39:57.353 --> 39:59.313
- Sir?
- The booze.

39:59.773 --> 40:01.440
There's a shipment tonight.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.443
Yes, sir.

40:04.527 --> 40:06.570
- That's actually not why I'm here.
- Why are you here?

40:07.238 --> 40:09.615
- What's your name again?
- Owen Sleater.

40:10.408 --> 40:14.244
I'm here, sir, 'cause I read the papers.

40:14.329 --> 40:15.954
More importantly I read between the lines.

40:16.581 --> 40:17.998
And you've concluded what?

40:18.666 --> 40:20.918
That my talents are being wasted behind a tap.

40:21.002 --> 40:23.504
What are your talents, Mr. Sleater?

40:23.922 --> 40:25.130
Making people stop.

40:25.673 --> 40:26.673
Stop what?

40:26.925 --> 40:28.884
Whatever it is you don't want them to be doing.

40:32.097 --> 40:35.057
What makes you think I need a man with those skills?

40:35.517 --> 40:40.854
Well, if you need me to tell you, sir, you need me more than I thought.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.524
Nucky, I just received a call.

40:44.776 --> 40:50.239
A ship-to-shore message from Bill McCoy. The Coast Guard is seizing his ships.

40:58.331 --> 41:00.624
I thank you for your time, sir.

42:16.492 --> 42:17.659
Hello?

42:20.288 --> 42:23.332
Hello? Hello.

42:24.626 --> 42:26.627
Delivery for Mueller.

42:30.173 --> 42:31.882
So you set the record.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.051
You wind her up.

42:37.305 --> 42:39.514
You place the needle...

42:43.186 --> 42:44.937
And you're all set.

42:45.104 --> 42:46.313
Hmm.

42:46.481 --> 42:48.315
Excuse me.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.401
Who sent this?

42:53.154 --> 42:57.157
That would be Mr. Mueller.

43:06.334 --> 43:08.085
The girl's being coy with you, Lilian.

43:08.169 --> 43:09.670
Oh, yes, him.

43:09.879 --> 43:11.505
"Oh, yes, him," she says.

43:11.589 --> 43:14.508
I saw the way you looked at him. We both did.

43:14.592 --> 43:17.135
- You were giddy as a schoolgirl...
- Is this a private party?

43:19.389 --> 43:20.597
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

43:20.848 --> 43:23.809
Sit. Pour me a drink.

43:25.770 --> 43:28.939
- More for yourselves as well.
- Are you sure, ma'am?

43:29.691 --> 43:33.485
It's the first drop kills you. So there's no harm in the last.

43:49.877 --> 43:51.503
Were you born in Ireland, Katy?

43:52.005 --> 43:53.380
No, ma'am. Here, ma'am.

43:54.173 --> 43:56.925
Please stop calling me that.

43:57.010 --> 44:00.053
If you had been, you'd have left the place.

44:01.055 --> 44:05.475
And far be it from anyone to begrudge you that escape.

44:05.560 --> 44:06.560
Am I right?

44:07.395 --> 44:09.104
Yes, ma'am... Missus.

44:09.272 --> 44:12.691
Margaret. Why put on airs?

44:13.318 --> 44:15.110
If you wish.

44:17.864 --> 44:18.905
What's this?

44:20.950 --> 44:22.701
Leave it.

44:27.749 --> 44:29.291
What's the matter?

44:32.086 --> 44:33.879
Nothing.

44:37.300 --> 44:38.592
I'd like you to dress for dinner.

44:39.469 --> 44:40.594
What?

44:40.803 --> 44:43.388
Get dressed, please. I'm taking you out.

45:47.620 --> 45:49.955
- Governor Edwards.
- How are you, Babette?

45:50.039 --> 45:52.582
- It's been too long.
- Yes, it has, yes, it has.

45:52.667 --> 45:54.292
- There they are.
- Governor.

45:54.377 --> 45:56.294
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.

45:56.379 --> 45:58.130
Oh, after you, my dear.

45:58.214 --> 46:00.006
Hey, you son of a bitch.

46:00.091 --> 46:02.050
- Louis, how are you?
- How are you?

46:02.135 --> 46:03.885
- Good to see you.
- Shake hands with my son, Jimmy.

46:03.970 --> 46:05.011
- A pleasure.
- Sir.

46:05.096 --> 46:06.721
Governor Edwards, sit down.

46:07.515 --> 46:11.268
I took the liberty of ordering you a little appetizer.

46:16.482 --> 46:18.150
Don't look so uncomfortable, Ed.

46:18.234 --> 46:20.986
You're not the biggest crook I've been seen in public with, Louis.

46:21.070 --> 46:22.779
Wish I could say the same about you.

46:25.366 --> 46:27.826
Are we shocking your youthful sensibilities?

46:28.119 --> 46:29.119
I've heard worse, sir.

46:29.203 --> 46:31.204
Jimmy went up against the Kaiser for two years.

46:32.039 --> 46:33.498
Oh, that's a rough patch of road.

46:34.250 --> 46:36.626
That was only war. This is Atlantic City.

46:39.130 --> 46:41.256
Well done, boy. Well done.

46:44.427 --> 46:47.012
Nucky. Good evening.

46:47.555 --> 46:49.723
It is. Four please.

46:50.349 --> 46:51.683
I wasn't expecting you.

46:56.981 --> 46:57.981
I'm sorry.

46:58.149 --> 47:00.275
It's fine. Relax.

47:00.443 --> 47:04.696
- Let's go to the Blenheim.
- We're eating here.

47:27.094 --> 47:32.057
So you intend to follow in your papa's footsteps?

47:32.141 --> 47:33.892
I'd like to think I'm my own man.

47:34.435 --> 47:37.187
I wouldn't have it any other way.

47:37.396 --> 47:40.774
But I am eager to learn everything I can.

47:41.359 --> 47:43.568
Yeah? What have you learned so far?

47:44.862 --> 47:46.279
Nothing's free.

47:49.825 --> 47:52.911
You know, I never thought Volstead was a good idea.

47:52.995 --> 47:54.663
You will after you open that envelope.

47:54.747 --> 47:57.332
The partisan nonsense it caused.

47:57.416 --> 48:00.168
You and I will be a lot closer, Ed.

48:00.253 --> 48:03.129
Republicans, Democrats, all fucking meaningless

48:03.548 --> 48:05.131
as soon as Nucky Thompson is...

48:05.341 --> 48:07.217
When he's brought to justice.

48:07.426 --> 48:08.927
Right.

48:09.011 --> 48:10.554
We'll have a gala fucking party.

48:11.556 --> 48:13.265
I'll be looking forward to it.

48:20.106 --> 48:21.356
I love this kid...

48:21.649 --> 48:24.067
I'd be happy to eat elsewhere.

48:24.151 --> 48:26.027
Didn't someone mention the Blenheim?

48:26.279 --> 48:28.363
Any questions about the menu?

48:31.701 --> 48:33.034
I think we're all set.

48:33.661 --> 48:35.954
The lady will have the veal chop.

48:36.038 --> 48:37.914
- I'll have the rib-eye.
- Very good, sir.

48:37.999 --> 48:41.001
- Mr. Thompson?
- Lobster Thermidor for the lady.

48:41.085 --> 48:42.210
Center-cut pork chops for me.

48:42.295 --> 48:44.379
I'm so sorry, sir, we're just out of the lobster.

48:45.172 --> 48:46.172
No.

48:46.299 --> 48:48.174
My apologies. Not a minute ago.

48:48.259 --> 48:50.885
- What would you recommend?
- We have chicken cordon bleu

48:51.095 --> 48:52.178
or a poached salmon.

48:53.014 --> 48:54.014
The chicken, then.

49:03.190 --> 49:04.190
Nuck.

49:04.317 --> 49:06.026
You've had your last meal in this place.

49:07.528 --> 49:08.528
Nucky.

49:08.738 --> 49:10.864
Get your fucking hand off me.

49:12.950 --> 49:15.952
Governor, what brings you to our seaside resort?

49:16.203 --> 49:18.079
You have my sympathy for your troubles, Nucky.

49:18.331 --> 49:21.541
And you have my undying wish for a long political career.

49:24.045 --> 49:26.504
You're looking very respectable, James.

49:26.756 --> 49:28.298
Meet his eyes, boy.

49:32.553 --> 49:34.721
I'd say we're both putting up a pretty good front.

49:35.264 --> 49:36.723
What did he promise you?

49:37.308 --> 49:38.475
More than you ever did.

49:38.559 --> 49:40.685
I keep my promises, James.

49:40.770 --> 49:43.480
And I'll make you one now. I will ruin you.

49:43.939 --> 49:44.939
All of you.

49:47.026 --> 49:48.276
You act more like a fucking child.

49:48.778 --> 49:50.570
You're the expert on children, aren't you?

49:54.325 --> 49:56.701
He never even asked her name.

49:56.786 --> 50:00.205
Just pointed to the one he wanted. The rest was understood.

50:00.748 --> 50:02.582
Jimmy! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

50:02.875 --> 50:05.085
You're stronger than that. Jimmy!

50:10.966 --> 50:12.258
Have a nice dinner, gentlemen.

50:15.596 --> 50:17.555
Jimmy.

50:20.518 --> 50:22.769
No, no, no, wait. Scratch that.

50:22.853 --> 50:27.399
Better yet, give me 10 rum, then 20 each of the rye and whiskey.

50:27.483 --> 50:28.608
Hey,

50:28.943 --> 50:30.360
peddle your goods elsewhere.

50:32.905 --> 50:34.322
We'll not be needing your services.

50:34.782 --> 50:37.283
- The fuck you talking about?
- We work for Mr. Thompson.

50:37.368 --> 50:38.952
These are not Mr. Thompson's men.

50:40.955 --> 50:42.831
You want this order or not?

50:43.207 --> 50:44.791
He does not.

50:47.628 --> 50:48.920
Take you for a soldier, lad.

50:50.965 --> 50:52.340
- I was.
- Uh-huh?

50:53.759 --> 50:55.719
And who is it you're fighting for now?

50:59.390 --> 51:03.226
Right. Back on the truck now, like good lads.

51:03.310 --> 51:05.687
I don't take orders from no fucking paddy.

51:05.813 --> 51:07.480
Of course you don't. This is America.

51:18.117 --> 51:19.826
Why did you not shoot me?

51:20.578 --> 51:22.245
I may yet.

51:27.543 --> 51:30.253
I've got no quarrel with you, sir.

51:30.337 --> 51:32.046
We're just not buying any liquor.

52:13.881 --> 52:15.882
You're home.

52:19.595 --> 52:21.846
For a while now.

52:24.725 --> 52:27.393
How was dinner with your father?

52:30.272 --> 52:32.065
Which one?

53:12.940 --> 53:14.357
What was that for?

53:14.525 --> 53:16.985
I don't ever want to see you sad again.

53:19.321 --> 53:20.321
Katy,

53:21.448 --> 53:22.949
would you lay out a suit for the morning?

53:23.242 --> 53:25.034
Yes, Mr. Thompson.

53:25.119 --> 53:26.828
Charcoal pinstripe, please,

53:27.413 --> 53:28.621
double-breasted.

53:30.499 --> 53:33.459
Oh, and tell Teddy not to dig in the front lawn.

53:40.134 --> 53:44.137
What happened at that dinner? He's certainly in better spirits.

53:44.263 --> 53:46.222
Good night, Katy.

53:49.393 --> 53:50.685
Peggy Rohan...

53:51.395 --> 53:52.979
That's you, isn't it?

53:54.565 --> 53:56.858
I'll never tell, don't worry.

54:04.491 --> 54:06.576
That will be all, Katy.
