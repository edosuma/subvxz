WEBVTT

00:03.120 --> 00:05.159
That's the chill-out and chat zone.

00:05.160 --> 00:07.719
Open 24/7, 365.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.559
Whether you're here to work,
not work or network,

00:10.560 --> 00:12.599
Elysium's always there for you.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.839
<font color="#FFFF00">Wow, this is amazing.</font>

00:14.840 --> 00:18.399
We have daily classes, yoga,
Boxercise...

00:18.400 --> 00:20.519
or maybe, do you like
Legs, Bums and Tums?

00:20.520 --> 00:22.559
<font color="#FFFF00">You just named</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my three favourite things.</font>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.919
We also offer
a round-the-clock buffet,

00:24.920 --> 00:27.879
hot-and-cold beverage station
and a smoothie bar.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.919
<font color="#FFFF00">Keep talking.</font>
I plan to.

00:29.920 --> 00:32.679
All club rules and info
are here in our brochure,

00:32.680 --> 00:35.399
or as we call it, our manifesto.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.239
"Elysium - not just a wellness
centre, a way of life."

00:39.240 --> 00:41.239
Now, are you interested
in joining?

00:41.240 --> 00:42.639
<font color="#FFFF00">Fuck, yes!</font>
Just a bit.

00:42.640 --> 00:45.519
<font color="#FFFF00">Huge! Membership packages begin</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">at just 95 Denari a month.</font>

00:45.520 --> 00:47.719
Ah, in that case, no.
Absolutely not.

00:47.720 --> 00:50.719
We'll just do the free trial.
We've got vouchers.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.920
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, right. Vouchers.</font>

00:55.040 --> 00:57.839
# Yeah!
When in Rome

00:57.840 --> 01:00.120
# Do as the Romans do

01:03.280 --> 01:05.438
# Far from home

01:05.440 --> 01:08.240
# All I got is you

01:11.160 --> 01:14.159
(SLURPING)
Mm-hm. I bloody love a smoothie!

01:14.160 --> 01:17.239
It's all the pleasure of eating
without the hassle of chewing.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.039
<font color="#FFFF00">I might have a crack</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">at the hot yoga.</font>

01:19.040 --> 01:21.639
Have a crack at the hot yoga
instructor, you mean?

01:21.640 --> 01:23.319
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, both, hopefully.</font>

01:23.320 --> 01:25.279
<font color="#FFFF00">Ooh, then maybe I'll get a facial.</font>

01:25.280 --> 01:28.079
We don't have time for facials.
We've got to go to work.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.439
<font color="#FFFF00">I was thinking,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">instead of going to work,</font>

01:30.440 --> 01:32.399
<font color="#FFFF00">why don't we pretend to be ill?</font>

01:32.400 --> 01:33.839
Yes, great idea.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.759
<font color="#FFFF00">Pretend to whom? It's our bar.</font>

01:35.760 --> 01:38.199
Please, man,
it's not a bar, it's a toilet.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.359
I don't want to spend
another day in a toilet.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Neither do I! But if we want it</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">more bar-y and less toilet-y,</font>

01:43.720 --> 01:45.759
<font color="#FFFF00">we need money to do it up.</font>

01:45.760 --> 01:48.199
<font color="#FFFF00">We won't make any money</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">unless we're open.</font>

01:48.200 --> 01:50.919
Then you open it. I think
I should cotch here today.

01:50.920 --> 01:53.279
I'm getting a peaky all of a sudden.
(COUGHS WEAKLY)

01:53.280 --> 01:55.119
<font color="#FFFF00">Right. Grumio?</font>

01:55.120 --> 01:57.439
Actually, I might cotch here
till tomorrow.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Tomorrow? How will that work?</font>

01:59.480 --> 02:01.999
Jase, in the bumph,
does it say the vouchers

02:02.000 --> 02:04.159
are for a trial day
or a trial session?

02:04.160 --> 02:05.839
<font color="#FFFF00">Ooh, hang on.</font>

02:05.840 --> 02:08.079
<font color="#FFFF00">"Elysium vouchers entitle the bearer</font>

02:08.080 --> 02:11.359
<font color="#FFFF00">to a one-use, free trial session."</font>

02:11.360 --> 02:14.559
Boom, and I'm in. Sessions
can last more than a day, mate.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.519
<font color="#FFFF00">Damn right. I've had sessions</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that have lasted several days.</font>

02:17.520 --> 02:20.319
Why stop there? You could stay
for a week or a month.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.759
In fact, why not just move in
here permanently?

02:22.760 --> 02:25.039
<font color="#FFFF00">Why wouldn't we? We've got</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">everything we need -</font>

02:25.040 --> 02:27.919
<font color="#FFFF00">food, beds,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">hot yoga instructors.</font>

02:27.920 --> 02:30.839
<font color="#FFFF00">As long as we stay put,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it's all one session.</font>

02:30.840 --> 02:34.319
OK, now I can't tell if you're
being serious or not.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.359
<font color="#FFFF00">That does look pretty serious.</font>
I'll run the bar on my own.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.639
Maybe see you in a few years,

02:39.640 --> 02:42.479
when I've made my millions and
can finally afford to come back.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, see you then.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Tell my mum I love her.</font>

02:45.480 --> 02:47.520
(SLURPS)
Lovely!

02:51.320 --> 02:54.279
Another one of your scrummy
pink smoothies, please, Nero.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Uh-huh? That'll be</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">your fifth so far, dude.</font>

02:56.800 --> 02:58.999
I know,
I'm getting my five a day.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.439
<font color="#FFFF00">The cherry attire</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">contains five fruits already</font>

03:01.440 --> 03:03.519
<font color="#FFFF00">so that'll be more like 25 a day.</font>

03:03.520 --> 03:04.999
You guys are all about wellness.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.959
<font color="#FFFF00">But the idea of the trial</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is to experience</font>

03:06.960 --> 03:08.719
<font color="#FFFF00">everything we have to offer here.</font>

03:08.720 --> 03:10.679
In that case,
I'll try a green smoothie.

03:10.680 --> 03:14.319
<font color="#FFFF00">Not really what I meant but,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that one's called Kale Caesar.</font>

03:14.320 --> 03:15.760
Oh, nice.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.999
Hurgh! Not nice, not nice.
Horrid.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.639
Ugh, tastes like liquid veg.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.559
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, it is. Kale's a vegetable.</font>

03:23.560 --> 03:25.640
Fuck me, that's proper nasty.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.840
Need a pink one now
to take the taste away.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.599
<font color="#FFFF00">Enjoy.</font>

03:31.600 --> 03:33.279
(MAN LAUGHS)

03:33.280 --> 03:37.279
Well, the villa's pure bliss
and I'm loving the new orchard

03:37.280 --> 03:39.359
but to be honest,
the problem now is,

03:39.360 --> 03:41.039
I've just got too much money.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.759
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, you poor thing.</font>
The admin's a mare.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.559
I'm seriously thinking about
getting out of minerals

03:46.560 --> 03:47.879
to ease the pressure.

03:47.880 --> 03:50.359
Maybe find something
smaller and funkier

03:50.360 --> 03:51.839
to invest in here in the city.

03:51.840 --> 03:55.119
Something hip that my kids
would think was cool.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.200
Let me know if
you hear of anything.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.320
<font color="#FFFF00">INSTRUCTOR: Onto all fours.</font>

04:07.160 --> 04:09.160
<font color="#FFFF00">Other arm back to here.</font>

04:10.160 --> 04:12.520
<font color="#FFFF00">Take it back down</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to the downward dog.</font>

04:17.640 --> 04:19.120
<font color="#FFFF00">That's right.</font>

04:21.600 --> 04:22.720
Oops!

04:25.360 --> 04:27.439
(LOW CHATTER)

04:27.440 --> 04:29.599
MAN: Namaste.

04:29.600 --> 04:33.399
<font color="#FFFF00">Hey, Cleo, I'm Jason.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">That was amazing. And hot.</font>

04:33.400 --> 04:36.759
Oh, my Jove, look at you,
you're absolutely dripping.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, the inside of my loin cloth's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like a bloody swamp.</font>

04:39.800 --> 04:43.159
(LAUGHS) That's great,
sweating's, like, crazy healthy.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.519
Just make sure you drink loads.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.999
<font color="#FFFF00">We could drink loads together,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if you like?</font>

04:48.000 --> 04:49.439
<font color="#FFFF00">Maybe over dinner?</font>

04:49.440 --> 04:52.679
Hm, I'm not sure. Don't usually
get with my students.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.999
<font color="#FFFF00">Please, I'm a really nice guy,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I promise.</font>

04:55.000 --> 04:57.239
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not some downward dog.</font>

04:57.240 --> 04:59.399
(LAUGHS) Go on, then.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.199
I live by the Esquiline Gate.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.839
Meet me there at eight.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.199
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes! Oooh, no.</font>

05:05.200 --> 05:07.879
<font color="#FFFF00">Actually, er...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">thinking about it,</font>

05:07.880 --> 05:10.039
<font color="#FFFF00">I'd kind of prefer to go</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">somewhere round here</font>

05:10.040 --> 05:11.279
<font color="#FFFF00">if that's all right?</font>

05:11.280 --> 05:13.719
Sure, there's this OK
tapas place nearby.

05:13.720 --> 05:19.759
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, tapas is good or, how</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about that restaurant nearby?</font>

05:19.760 --> 05:21.239
You mean the canteen?

05:21.240 --> 05:23.199
<font color="#FFFF00">It's really nice.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Have you tried it?</font>

05:23.200 --> 05:25.839
Yeah, I've had lunch here every
day for the last eight years.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.119
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, great,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">then you know you like it!</font>

05:28.120 --> 05:29.560
(CHUCKLES WEAKLY)

05:32.600 --> 05:34.839
Ciao for now.
<font color="#FFFF00">Excuse me. Hi.</font>

05:34.840 --> 05:38.039
Hi. Yes, what?

05:38.040 --> 05:39.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Sorry, I couldn't help but overhear</font>

05:39.720 --> 05:41.879
<font color="#FFFF00">your conversation</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in the changing room.</font>

05:41.880 --> 05:43.679
<font color="#FFFF00">The villa sounds great.</font>
Thank you.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.559
It's bliss.
What can I do for you, friend?

05:46.560 --> 05:49.599
<font color="#FFFF00">You said you were on the lookout</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for some hip new investments</font>

05:49.600 --> 05:51.839
<font color="#FFFF00">and I think I may have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">just the thing.</font>

05:51.840 --> 05:54.239
I am indeed, and I would
love to hear about it.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.519
Genuinely.
<font color="#FFFF00">Excellent.</font>

05:55.520 --> 05:58.359
But I need to pick up my daughter
from an audition.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.879
<font color="#FFFF00">Ah, OK, we could meet another time?</font>

06:00.880 --> 06:02.959
Absolutely. Collar me
when you're next here

06:02.960 --> 06:04.519
and you can give me the full pitch.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.359
<font color="#FFFF00">Right, yes. Here as in?</font>

06:07.360 --> 06:11.119
Elysium. Oh, it's fine,
all the members do business here.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.399
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, yeah. Oh, I know we do.</font>

06:13.400 --> 06:16.999
<font color="#FFFF00">It's just I'm not 100 per cent</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">as to when I'll next be back.</font>

06:17.000 --> 06:19.519
I'm sure we'll run into each
other. I'm here all the time.

06:19.520 --> 06:22.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Great. Me too.</font>
Until then.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.199
<font color="#FFFF00">I hope your daughter gets the part.</font>

06:24.200 --> 06:28.519
She bloody well should do, friend.
I own the theatre.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.640
<font color="#FFFF00">Hm.</font>

06:31.000 --> 06:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:38.000 --> 06:40.559
That was quick.
Made your millions already?

06:40.560 --> 06:42.919
<font color="#FFFF00">I might have done, actually.</font>

06:42.920 --> 06:44.240
Cheers.

06:54.920 --> 06:56.920
(GRUMIO GRUNTS)

06:58.560 --> 06:59.800
(LAUGHTER)

07:04.000 --> 07:06.439
<font color="#FFFF00">Cos people think yoga's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">just for the body,</font>

07:06.440 --> 07:09.599
<font color="#FFFF00">but it also really clears the mind.</font>

07:09.600 --> 07:11.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Sometimes when I'm doing the poses,</font>

07:11.720 --> 07:14.719
<font color="#FFFF00">it's honestly like my brain's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">completely empty.</font>

07:14.720 --> 07:18.919
Oh, that must be wicked, cos I'm
quite a sort of thinky person.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.079
So I'd love to have an empty head
and a bendy bod.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.639
<font color="#FFFF00">Then yoga's the answer.</font>

07:23.640 --> 07:25.319
<font color="#FFFF00">You'd have to put the hours in,</font>

07:25.320 --> 07:26.999
<font color="#FFFF00">spend a lot of time in this place.</font>

07:27.000 --> 07:28.719
Yeah, that won't be a problem.

07:28.720 --> 07:32.919
<font color="#FFFF00">All right, then, swampy pants.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You can be my little project.</font>

07:32.920 --> 07:35.119
<font color="#FFFF00">We could go back to mine</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and make a head start,</font>

07:35.120 --> 07:37.479
<font color="#FFFF00">try some positions</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that are a bit hotter?</font>

07:37.480 --> 07:40.199
Oh, yes, please.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.439
But, you know what would
be even hotter

07:42.440 --> 07:44.359
than going back to your place?

07:44.360 --> 07:48.839
Staying here and doing it
in, like, a corner.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.519
<font color="#FFFF00">A corner?</font>
Or behind that large fern.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.559
<font color="#FFFF00">Them ferns creep me out a bit.</font>

07:53.560 --> 07:57.559
OK, so is there a yucca
or maybe just a basic hedge?

07:57.560 --> 08:00.839
<font color="#FFFF00">I've keys to the storeroom.</font>
Or a storeroom. Exactly!

08:00.840 --> 08:02.480
(MOANING AND GRUNTING)

08:03.880 --> 08:05.959
Agh, my legs!

08:05.960 --> 08:08.479
Actually, I don't think
I can support you.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.199
<font color="#FFFF00">You need to engage your core.</font>

08:10.200 --> 08:12.200
I don't think I've got one.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.839
I would have walked her home
but that's out of bounds,

08:16.840 --> 08:19.359
so, uh...I just
escorted her to reception.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Ah, how romantic!</font>

08:20.720 --> 08:22.639
<font color="#FFFF00">And are you planning on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">seeing her again?</font>

08:22.640 --> 08:23.959
That's the beauty of it.

08:23.960 --> 08:27.199
I'll see her at yoga class
tomorrow, it's so convenient.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.159
<font color="#FFFF00">Apart from lying about</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">where you live</font>

08:29.160 --> 08:31.639
<font color="#FFFF00">and having sex in a cupboard.</font>
Wow!

08:31.640 --> 08:34.279
You've really made the most
of your free trial.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.198
Hope you've enjoyed yourselves,
lads?

08:36.200 --> 08:39.558
<font color="#FFFF00">We have, very much, thanks,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and we'll continue to do so.</font>

08:39.559 --> 08:42.198

<font color="#FFFF00">GRUMIO: So when will that be?</font>

17:33.970 --> 17:37.329
No idea. He's going to
his huge Sicilian villa.

17:37.330 --> 17:39.489
It could take him weeks
just to see every wing.

17:39.490 --> 17:41.689
I've just got to accept
I am now officially

17:41.690 --> 17:43.089
here for the long haul.

17:43.090 --> 17:44.969
<font color="#FFFF00">Boom. Welcome to the neighbourhood.</font>

17:44.970 --> 17:47.289
Evening, lads, thought
I'd come and administer

17:47.290 --> 17:49.049
your nightly turn-down service.

17:49.050 --> 17:51.009
<font color="#FFFF00">Cheers, Nero, you do look after us.</font>

17:51.010 --> 17:55.289
Whoa, no! N-uh! Where in hot fuck
did you get that pineapple?

17:55.290 --> 17:57.929
<font color="#FFFF00">This? It was sitting next</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to the beef and the cheese.</font>

17:57.930 --> 18:00.369
Bullshit, you must have been
in the storeroom.

18:00.370 --> 18:02.289
Who was it? Who let you in?
<font color="#FFFF00">Not telling.</font>

18:02.290 --> 18:05.729
That beef is a contraband buffet
item. Give it back, dude!

18:05.730 --> 18:08.289
<font color="#FFFF00">Get off me meat! No, no!</font>

18:08.290 --> 18:09.809
(SIZZLING)
Oh!

18:09.810 --> 18:12.569
Oh, my arse! You singed my buns!

18:12.570 --> 18:14.369
(LAUGHTER)

18:14.370 --> 18:17.810
Oh, OK, I know who it was.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.969
<font color="#FFFF00">Oi, Nero, wait!</font>

18:25.970 --> 18:28.770
<font color="#FFFF00">This isn't her fault!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">She had nothing to do with it!</font>

18:29.810 --> 18:32.969
And, hold, hold, hold...

18:32.970 --> 18:36.529
two, three, four...

18:36.530 --> 18:39.409
<font color="#FFFF00">Roll up your mat and get out of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">here, you bendy bitch.</font>

18:39.410 --> 18:41.849
You what? I'm in the middle
of a class here, Nero.

18:41.850 --> 18:44.529
<font color="#FFFF00">You allowed unauthorised</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">personnel into the storeroom.</font>

18:44.530 --> 18:47.089
Oh, shit.
<font color="#FFFF00">To steal contraband food.</font>

18:47.090 --> 18:50.089
No, that's not why. Me and Jase
were just having sex in there.

18:50.090 --> 18:52.129
<font color="#FFFF00">Whoa, OK, well, that's even worse.</font>

18:52.130 --> 18:55.329
To be fair, there aren't many
places for people to do it here.

18:55.330 --> 18:57.409
<font color="#FFFF00">Because we don't want people</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to do it in here!</font>

18:57.410 --> 18:59.649
Makes sense.
<font color="#FFFF00">But we didn't steal anything.</font>

18:59.650 --> 19:02.489
<font color="#FFFF00">It was just in and out.</font>
All the theft was Grumio.

19:02.490 --> 19:03.809
He snuck in as we were at it.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.929
<font color="#FFFF00">Lovely stuff.</font>
Oh, my God, you little perv!

19:05.930 --> 19:08.089
How much did you see?
<font color="#FFFF00">Not much, actually.</font>

19:08.090 --> 19:11.129
<font color="#FFFF00">I were mainly looking for beef.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Great core strength, by the way.</font>

19:11.130 --> 19:13.529
Cheers, man. Yeah, it's all about
them deep squats.

19:13.530 --> 19:15.049
<font color="#FFFF00">Keeping those heels on the deck.</font>

19:15.050 --> 19:16.649
<font color="#FFFF00">Either way, you broke staff rules</font>

19:16.650 --> 19:19.649
<font color="#FFFF00">taking guests to the storeroom,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and that's a sackable offence.</font>

19:19.650 --> 19:22.449
No, please, Nero, I really need
this job. I'm so happy here.

19:22.450 --> 19:25.889
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, come on, look, don't sack</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">her. There's no need for that.</font>

19:25.890 --> 19:30.289
OK. Look, she can keep her job
on one condition.

19:30.290 --> 19:32.809
That you three apes leave
the bathhouse immediately,

19:32.810 --> 19:34.689
thereby ending your trial session.

19:34.690 --> 19:38.089
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, thank you, Nero.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">We really appreciate that.</font>

19:38.090 --> 19:40.129
Well...hang on a sec, babe.

19:40.130 --> 19:42.169
<font color="#FFFF00">What? Why?</font>

19:42.170 --> 19:44.969
<font color="#FFFF00">Surely there's no contest?</font>

19:44.970 --> 19:46.169
<font color="#FFFF00">Jason?</font>

19:46.170 --> 19:48.049
It's your call, hombre.

19:48.050 --> 19:50.369
What's more important to you -

19:50.370 --> 19:53.809
your girlfriend or the bathhouse?

19:53.810 --> 19:56.649
<font color="#FFFF00">You really are an awful</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">human being, aren't you?</font>

19:56.650 --> 19:59.649
But with such great skin.
<font color="#FFFF00">There'll be other instructors.</font>

19:59.650 --> 20:02.449
Exactly. And I quite fancy
that old cleaner, actually.

20:02.450 --> 20:04.289
Just to tide me over.

20:04.290 --> 20:07.929
Hey, Nero, when do we meet
the new yoga teacher?

20:07.930 --> 20:10.209
<font color="#FFFF00">Never, because you're leaving.</font>

20:10.210 --> 20:13.169
Nice one! Don't make me get
the manifesto out again.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.409
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm afraid the manifesto</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is now null and void.</font>

20:15.410 --> 20:16.929
<font color="#FFFF00">As is Elysium itself.</font>

20:16.930 --> 20:19.449
<font color="#FFFF00">We're being taken over</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">by a major investor.</font>

20:19.450 --> 20:22.689
<font color="#FFFF00">Sadly for you, Evander Leisure</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">doesn't offer free trials.</font>

20:22.690 --> 20:24.969
Sorry, Evander? As in...

20:24.970 --> 20:27.009
<font color="#FFFF00">..have a retractable roof...</font>

20:27.010 --> 20:28.209
Hey.

20:28.210 --> 20:29.769
You're back from Sicily.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.489
<font color="#FFFF00">Ah, I was hoping</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to run into you, friend.</font>

20:32.490 --> 20:35.169
<font color="#FFFF00">I wanted to thank you.</font>
You're welcome. What for?

20:35.170 --> 20:38.809
<font color="#FFFF00">For encouraging me to diversify,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to invest in the leisure sector.</font>

20:38.810 --> 20:41.249
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, I did
specifically mean our bar.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.849
Any chance you'll still do that?

20:42.850 --> 20:45.289
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, God, no. I want to put</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">all my energy into this place</font>

20:45.290 --> 20:47.689
<font color="#FFFF00">rather than flush my money</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">down a toilet.</font>

20:47.690 --> 20:50.009
It's a bar.
<font color="#FFFF00">Toilet, bar - bar, toilet.</font>

20:50.010 --> 20:52.169
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a branding shit-storm</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">either way.</font>

20:52.170 --> 20:53.929
If you really wanted
to thank Marcus,

20:53.930 --> 20:56.289
give him and his mates
lifetime membership.

20:56.290 --> 20:58.649
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, I prefer to leave</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that sort of thing</font>

20:58.650 --> 21:00.649
<font color="#FFFF00">to the discretion</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of the club manager.</font>

21:00.650 --> 21:02.969
That's a no from me.
Leave your robes and slippers

21:02.970 --> 21:04.529
at reception on your way out.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.729
<font color="#FFFF00">We'll get our clothes</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">from the lockers first.</font>

21:06.730 --> 21:08.529
You won't, dude.
As part of the rebrand,

21:08.530 --> 21:12.049
the contents of the lockers
have been incinerated.

21:12.050 --> 21:13.570
(LAUGHTER)

21:15.210 --> 21:17.089
<font color="#FFFF00">I kind of missed this, as it goes.</font>

21:17.090 --> 21:20.489
<font color="#FFFF00">The traffic, the dogs, the dirt.</font>

21:20.490 --> 21:23.929
<font color="#FFFF00">The dog dirt.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It's actually good to be back.</font>

21:23.930 --> 21:26.689
Oh, no, Grumio, please shield it.

21:26.690 --> 21:28.690
<font color="#FFFF00">You shield it, if you don't like it.</font>
