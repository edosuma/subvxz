00:01.697 --> 00:04.221
Previously on
"Billy The Kid"...

00:04.352 --> 00:05.657
[Billy] Why are you
staring at me?

00:05.788 --> 00:07.398
[Pat] Thought I recognized you,
is all.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.487
-[Billy] What's your name?
-I'm Pat Garrett.

00:09.618 --> 00:10.880
I'm ridin' with
a good friend of yours.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.621
[Billy] Last time I saw Jesse,

00:12.751 --> 00:13.665
things weren't too good
between us.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.580
Hello, Jesse.

00:15.711 --> 00:16.799
[Jesse] I'm really glad
to see you, Billy.

00:16.929 --> 00:19.497
We made the papers, boys!

00:19.628 --> 00:21.586
-[gunshots]
-[Pat] "A recent shootout

00:21.717 --> 00:23.849
between the Seven Rivers gang
and some of Chisum's cowboys

00:23.980 --> 00:26.591
resulted in the deaths
of five men."

00:26.722 --> 00:30.595
Why do you have to rob
and kill people like me?

00:30.726 --> 00:31.857
[Pat] Including a lad of 17.

00:31.988 --> 00:33.685
-[gunshot]
-[splashing]

00:33.816 --> 00:35.687
You're getting pretty
famous now.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.950
Your face is in a lot of places.
People talk about you.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.778
[Billy] That don't mean
nothing to me.

00:39.909 --> 00:42.738
I sure as hell don't want to be
famous for killing people.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.609
[Jesse] Boys, allow me
to introduce a very old

00:44.740 --> 00:46.916
friend of mine--Frank Baker.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.962
The plan, boys, is for us to
head on in to Lincoln County.

00:50.093 --> 00:53.488
There's a big player in Lincoln.
His name's Lawrence P. Murphy.

00:53.618 --> 00:54.924
He wants to protect
his operation,

00:55.055 --> 00:56.621
and that's where we come in.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.449
And, Billy, we'll make sure

00:58.580 --> 00:59.842
you get the biggest slice
of the cake

00:59.972 --> 01:01.539
when it comes time
for remuneration.

01:01.670 --> 01:02.932
Wait a minute there.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.412
If people want my services...

01:04.542 --> 01:07.676
[gunshots]

01:07.806 --> 01:09.373
...they're gonna have
to pay for 'em.

01:09.504 --> 01:13.769
[in Spanish]

01:13.899 --> 01:16.424
We're setting out for Lincoln.
It's all arranged.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.426
[Billy] I'll meet you there.

01:18.556 --> 01:20.602
Billy, you came.

01:20.732 --> 01:23.431
[Billy] I had to.
You're in here 'cause of me.

01:23.561 --> 01:25.607
[gunshot]

01:25.737 --> 01:27.391
I'm gonna miss you.

01:27.522 --> 01:28.914
[in Spanish]

01:29.045 --> 01:30.525
[speaks Spanish, clicks tongue]

01:41.536 --> 01:44.104
[theme music plays]

01:56.768 --> 01:59.510
[soft music plays]

02:41.900 --> 02:44.686
[indistinct chatter]

03:42.874 --> 03:46.051
-[man] Billy.
-[Billy] Boys.

03:46.182 --> 03:47.792
[Pat] Hey, Billy!

03:51.013 --> 03:53.581
-It's good to see you.
-Good to see you, too.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.800
[Pat]
How'd the rescue mission go?

03:55.931 --> 04:00.370
I got him out.
That's all that matters.

04:04.679 --> 04:07.899
Aw, look who's here.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.597
Here he is.

04:09.727 --> 04:10.685
[Billy] Frank.

04:12.904 --> 04:14.689
Sight for sore eyes.

04:22.044 --> 04:25.047
Hey, Billy, listen.

04:25.177 --> 04:27.832
We got a really good thing
going here.

04:27.963 --> 04:30.095
Frank was right.

04:30.226 --> 04:32.707
This guy Murphy, he owns
a big store in Lincoln.

04:32.837 --> 04:35.013
But, uh...

04:35.144 --> 04:35.971
A whole lot more than that.

04:36.101 --> 04:39.148
Yup. I told him about you,

04:39.279 --> 04:40.671
but he's already
heard about you.

04:40.802 --> 04:41.977
And he wants a meeting with you.

04:42.107 --> 04:44.109
Okay.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.807
He's got a couple of guys
working for him

04:45.937 --> 04:47.199
really running
the operation there.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.985
It's, uh, Johnny Riley
and Jim Dolan.

04:50.115 --> 04:51.856
Couple smart fellas.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.684
They got a company
called The House,

04:53.815 --> 04:54.903
and they run it out
of Murphy's store.

04:55.033 --> 04:57.688
That's where they all
want to meet you.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.734
So when do I get to meet 'em?

04:59.864 --> 05:02.432
[indistinct chatter,
horses galloping]

05:32.027 --> 05:33.681
[Billy] Howdy.

05:37.989 --> 05:39.861
[Murphy] Come in!

05:43.125 --> 05:44.648
[door closes]

05:47.434 --> 05:49.697
-Jesse, Frank.
-[Frank] Mr. Murphy.

05:49.827 --> 05:51.612
Great to see ya's again.

05:54.179 --> 05:58.009
So, you're Billy the Kid?

05:58.140 --> 06:02.318
Yes, sir, I am.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.189
Well, Billy, I want to say
it is a great honor

06:04.320 --> 06:06.148
to finally meet you
in the flesh. Great honor.

06:06.278 --> 06:09.020
-Why's that?
-"Why's that?" he says.

06:09.151 --> 06:11.240
[chuckles]

06:11.371 --> 06:13.068
Because you've a reputation.

06:13.198 --> 06:15.331
From where I'm standing,
it is a great reputation.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.855
You know how to look
after yourself.

06:17.986 --> 06:19.117
That's what I'm lookin' for.
I'm lookin' for tough people

06:19.248 --> 06:21.163
who can take on any challenge!

06:21.293 --> 06:23.252
And who aren't afraid
to take on new challenges.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.689
Am I right in saying that, son?

06:25.820 --> 06:26.734
I guess so.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.170
'Course I'm right.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.867
You're an Irishman,

06:29.998 --> 06:32.435
just like me.

06:32.566 --> 06:36.700
Just like my partners here,
Johnny Riley, Jim Dolan.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.920
Say hello, boys.

06:39.050 --> 06:41.052
It's nice to meet you.

06:43.577 --> 06:48.233
Now, Billy, I don't know
what these lads have told you,

06:48.364 --> 06:50.235
but we pay well here
for a job well done.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.194
An important aspect
of your work will be

06:52.324 --> 06:54.501
to enforce
our business interests.

06:54.631 --> 06:57.765
You may have seen this new store
down at the end of the street.

06:57.895 --> 06:58.940
[Dolan] This fellow Tunstall,

06:59.070 --> 07:00.376
he's brought in
a herd of cattle,

07:00.507 --> 07:01.943
and he's already grabbing land
and hiring cowboys.

07:02.073 --> 07:03.945
[Riley]
And we need that to stop.

07:04.075 --> 07:08.166
You see, what you need
to understand here, Billy...

07:08.297 --> 07:09.777
is that this is my kingdom.

07:09.907 --> 07:11.169
[glass clatters]

07:11.300 --> 07:13.258
My kingdom.

07:13.389 --> 07:16.958
I founded it,
and I built it up from nothing.

07:17.088 --> 07:20.309
So, I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let a stranger,

07:20.440 --> 07:21.963
let alone some prick Englishman,
take it away from me.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.747
That's not gonna happen.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.401
Not gonna happen.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.142
Not as long as
you're around, Billy.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.665
That's for sure, right?

07:31.276 --> 07:33.931
So, here's to a new partnership.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.890
You, Jesse, and your friends

07:36.020 --> 07:37.892
are all welcome additions
to The House.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.067
I sincerely hope
that this ongoing partnership

07:39.197 --> 07:41.939
enriches all of us.

07:42.070 --> 07:45.029
Now, here's to ya's.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.119
[eerie music plays]

07:48.250 --> 07:49.730
[glass clatters]

07:58.216 --> 08:01.002
[indistinct chatter]

08:28.943 --> 08:31.206
Hey, Billy.

08:32.990 --> 08:37.865
[cans clatter and roll on floor]

08:37.995 --> 08:41.129
Jesse. Smell off to you?

08:41.259 --> 08:44.001
[chuckles]

08:50.094 --> 08:52.227
[man] Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

08:52.357 --> 08:57.058
[grains spill to floor]

09:01.323 --> 09:03.978
[grains resume spilling]

09:04.108 --> 09:06.894
You, uh, know where
Mr. Tunstall is?

09:07.024 --> 09:09.244
We'd like to have a word.

09:09.374 --> 09:13.204
Mr. Tunstall is currently
in Santa Fe, buying stock.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.038
[inhales deeply]

09:21.169 --> 09:24.999
This grain smells musty.

09:25.129 --> 09:27.088
Must've got damp.

09:27.218 --> 09:31.135
Everything here is piss poor.

09:31.266 --> 09:34.356
Not like Mr. Murphy's.

09:34.486 --> 09:37.446
[man] I can assure you, sir,
that everything here

09:37.577 --> 09:40.188
is of the same quality as that
sold in Mr. Murphy's store.

09:40.318 --> 09:43.104
Don't get smart with me, boy.

09:49.153 --> 09:51.895
[Billy] Hey.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.730
We're done here.

10:10.697 --> 10:14.178
You tell Mr. Tunstall
we'll be back.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.137
So fucking polite, Billy.

10:16.267 --> 10:19.314
Yup. And you're an ass.

10:22.404 --> 10:23.927
What is that?

10:28.323 --> 10:30.281
[Dolan] Aw, that's him
all right.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.457
That turncoat McSween.

10:32.588 --> 10:35.635
That's probably his new wife.

10:35.765 --> 10:37.158
[Riley] I just can't believe
he came back.

10:37.288 --> 10:39.551
I thought he was gone forever.

10:39.682 --> 10:44.644
A piano?! Where the fuck does
he think he is? New Orleans?

10:44.774 --> 10:46.341
I don't think that man's
coming back into town

10:46.471 --> 10:50.301
just to play the piano.

10:50.432 --> 10:53.217
[eerie music plays]

11:23.465 --> 11:25.685
[horses approaching]

11:30.298 --> 11:33.867
[in Spanish]

11:38.567 --> 11:40.047
[whispers]

11:45.139 --> 11:46.488
What do you want with me?

11:46.618 --> 11:48.316
[Jesse]
Well, we're just checking up.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.274
We heard a man called
John Tunstall,

11:50.405 --> 11:52.450
who owns a store in Lincoln,

11:52.581 --> 11:56.367
been collecting grain notes
from farmers.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.500
You sign such a note?

11:58.630 --> 12:01.633
SÃ­.

12:01.764 --> 12:05.420
You're breaking your sworn
agreement with Mr. Murphy.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.335
You owe him your grain.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.360
What's he saying?

12:32.490 --> 12:33.274
He's saying Murphy cheats him.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.543
Listen to me,
you fucking Mexican.

12:41.673 --> 12:43.371
[Billy] Hey, Jesse.

12:45.677 --> 12:49.116
You're gonna honor
your agreement to Mr. Murphy,

12:49.246 --> 12:52.206
the one that you signed...

12:52.336 --> 12:54.164
or we're coming back here.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.038
Nod your fucking head.
You understand?

12:58.168 --> 12:59.387
Come on, Jesse.

12:59.517 --> 13:03.217
-You understand?
-You made your point.

13:03.347 --> 13:06.350
[Jesse spits]

13:06.481 --> 13:09.310
âªâªâª

13:18.667 --> 13:20.800
-[clicks tongue]
-[horse nickers]

13:30.418 --> 13:33.116
[indistinct chatter]

13:35.510 --> 13:38.339
[Murphy] So why'd you guys
want a meeting?

13:38.469 --> 13:41.472
We think it's about time we tell
you the truth there, Lawrence.

13:41.603 --> 13:44.519
The truth is that The House
is in deep trouble.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.738
This fellow Tunstall,
he's real competition;

13:46.869 --> 13:50.786
he's hurtin' us,
and he's taking our business.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.658
The fact is, we've plunged
deep into debt.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.747
Now, we bought the firm
from you in good faith,

13:55.878 --> 13:59.273
but you gave us no indication
how bad things were gettin'.

13:59.403 --> 14:02.232
We've signed notes
for over $12,000

14:02.363 --> 14:03.320
just to keep
the business goin'.

14:03.451 --> 14:05.322
And as it stands,

14:05.453 --> 14:07.542
we haven't got a hope in hell
of paying 'em off.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.805
Now, we've heard rumors
that Tunstall has hired McSween,

14:09.936 --> 14:11.807
the lawyer that used
to work for you.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.678
Now, if that's true,
things just got

14:13.809 --> 14:15.550
a whole lot more difficult
for all of us

14:15.680 --> 14:17.378
because the last thing
that we need

14:17.508 --> 14:19.206
is the law sniffin' around.

14:19.336 --> 14:23.427
Mm. Listen.

14:23.558 --> 14:26.474
Listen to me.

14:26.604 --> 14:29.781
You both know that I have
friends in high places.

14:29.912 --> 14:33.089
No one is gonna
foreclose on us.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.743
No one.

14:34.874 --> 14:39.313
And no one is gonna outgun us.

14:39.443 --> 14:42.664
Yeah?

14:42.794 --> 14:46.146
Aye.

14:46.276 --> 14:49.105
âªâªâª

14:54.241 --> 14:57.635
Whoa.

14:57.766 --> 14:59.289
[Frank] Well, that looks like

14:59.420 --> 15:00.638
some of Tunstall's boys
right there.

15:00.769 --> 15:03.859
That fella right up front there,
that's George Coe.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.383
He's a farmer who signed
up with Tunstall.

15:06.514 --> 15:07.515
[Jesse] What are they doin'
this side of the valley?

15:07.645 --> 15:09.256
I say we go talk to 'em.

15:09.386 --> 15:10.344
-[horse snorting]
-Yah!

15:10.474 --> 15:14.565
[men calling out]

15:26.708 --> 15:29.537
-[Jesse] You George Coe?
-[horse whinnies]

15:29.667 --> 15:31.452
I am.

15:31.582 --> 15:34.411
And I believe
you're Jesse Evans.

15:34.542 --> 15:35.935
What can I do for you?

15:36.065 --> 15:38.372
Well, you can clear outta here
for a start.

15:38.502 --> 15:39.808
I thought this was
a free country.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.418
Who told you that, boy?

15:41.549 --> 15:42.985
We don't wanna see you

15:43.116 --> 15:46.728
within five miles of our cattle
or our grain stores.

15:46.858 --> 15:50.732
Or interfering with our farmers.

15:50.862 --> 15:53.474
Yeah, that's right.
We know your game.

15:53.604 --> 15:57.043
Mr. Tunstall's got legitimate
business interests here,

15:57.173 --> 15:59.654
and you have no right tryin' to
prevent us from pursuing them.

16:03.527 --> 16:06.966
This says I do.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.621
Is that a threat?
Are you threatening us?

16:10.752 --> 16:12.449
[horses whinny]

16:12.580 --> 16:14.756
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

16:14.886 --> 16:15.757
[Billy] Nobody's
threatening anybody.

16:15.887 --> 16:18.978
-What are you gonna do?
-Are they, Jesse?

16:19.108 --> 16:21.415
We're just here to protect
Mr. Murphy's interests

16:21.545 --> 16:23.286
same as you all are doing
for your boss.

16:23.417 --> 16:26.376
That's all.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.552
Who are you?

16:28.683 --> 16:30.772
I'm Billy.

16:34.689 --> 16:35.995
Hah! Come on, boys!

16:40.782 --> 16:41.478
-[Pat] Come on!
-Yah!

16:41.609 --> 16:44.525
[horses depart]

16:45.613 --> 16:48.355
[indistinct chatter,
fiddle playing up-tempo tune]

17:02.978 --> 17:04.893
What's this about?

17:05.024 --> 17:06.503
We hired you boys to send
a message

17:06.634 --> 17:08.766
to the people
around here because

17:08.897 --> 17:11.465
our business is nowhere near
as healthy as we need it to be.

17:11.595 --> 17:12.814
But Tunstall is still buying
off our farmers

17:12.944 --> 17:14.555
and undercuttin' us.

17:14.685 --> 17:17.514
We need it to stop. Now.

17:17.645 --> 17:20.909
These Mexican farmers think
we won't do anything

17:21.040 --> 17:22.867
about them breakin' our deals.

17:22.998 --> 17:25.696
They think our deals are just
worthless pieces of paper.

17:25.827 --> 17:27.524
I rode up. I spoke
to one of those Mexican farmers

17:27.655 --> 17:29.004
just the other day.

17:29.135 --> 17:32.486
I know, and it made
no difference.

17:32.616 --> 17:34.879
They're still intent on selling
the grain to Tunstall.

17:35.010 --> 17:39.710
You need to show them
that we mean business.

17:39.841 --> 17:42.365
That's what we're
paying you for.

17:42.496 --> 17:43.714
Do you understand that?

17:43.845 --> 17:47.544
I do, yes, Mr. Riley.

17:47.675 --> 17:49.677
You can trust us.

17:49.807 --> 17:52.027
I knew we understood each other.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.073
Otherwise, I'd be worried
that I'd have to rethink

17:54.203 --> 17:56.597
having hired ya and your
expensive friend, Billy.

17:56.727 --> 17:58.990
Now let's go and join

17:59.121 --> 18:01.428
Mr. Murphy's
generous hospitality.

18:01.558 --> 18:06.520
âªâªâª

18:06.650 --> 18:08.391
[song ends]

18:08.522 --> 18:12.700
[cheers and applause]

18:12.830 --> 18:14.658
[Riley] There he is.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.707
Billy. [clears throat]

18:19.837 --> 18:21.883
Come here.

18:22.013 --> 18:24.799
I would like to introduce you
to my wife.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.714
Honey, this is the fella
I was telling you about.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.716
This is Billy the Kid.

18:28.846 --> 18:30.631
Billy belongs to The House now.

18:30.761 --> 18:33.547
-This is Irene.
-Howdy.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.592
So, you're a cowboy, are you?

18:35.723 --> 18:37.855
Oh, he's an outlaw, baby.

18:37.986 --> 18:41.163
This man's wanted for murder.

18:41.294 --> 18:44.514
Well, it sure is nice to meet
such a handsome outlaw.

18:47.691 --> 18:50.390
Billy.

18:57.788 --> 19:01.531
[indistinct chatter]

19:05.927 --> 19:08.625
This is a bit of fun.

19:08.756 --> 19:10.366
Sure.

19:15.589 --> 19:16.938
Who's that?

19:17.068 --> 19:18.809
[Jesse] Yeah.
That's the local sheriff.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.813
District court judge.

19:22.944 --> 19:25.120
What about him?

19:25.251 --> 19:28.732
[Jesse] Colonel.
He's from the Fort.

19:28.863 --> 19:29.777
[Billy] Murphy has
important friends.

19:29.907 --> 19:33.041
[Dolan] Hey, Billy.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.175
Uh, we've, uh, set up a little
fun thing for you to do.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.046
See, everyone here,
they want to see what

19:38.177 --> 19:40.788
you can do with a gun, hmm?
They've all heard the stories.

19:40.918 --> 19:43.573
Murphy thinks it would
be a great idea

19:43.704 --> 19:45.053
for you to give them
all a little,

19:45.184 --> 19:46.663
you know, a demonstration.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.535
Yeah? No.

19:48.665 --> 19:51.712
Ah. [chuckles]

19:51.842 --> 19:53.844
Okay, okay, Billy.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.759
[chuckles]

19:55.890 --> 19:59.154
I see you don't understand
how this works.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.852
We're paying you
a whole lot of money.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.114
So, if we ask you to do

20:03.245 --> 20:05.029
something small for us
in return,

20:05.160 --> 20:07.728
we expect you to do it.

20:07.858 --> 20:08.946
Now come this way.

20:09.077 --> 20:12.341
I don't feel like doing that.

20:19.827 --> 20:22.003
[Dolan] Come, Jimmy.

20:22.133 --> 20:24.788
[speaking inaudibly]

20:30.011 --> 20:31.534
Billy...now...

20:34.798 --> 20:38.759
Drink that whiskey
and just remember who you are.

20:38.889 --> 20:42.023
You're special.
You're different.

20:42.153 --> 20:44.634
There's no one here
in this room, in this county,

20:44.765 --> 20:46.332
who's got the reputation
that you've got.

20:46.462 --> 20:52.207
So, we need you to show us just
a little of how good you are.

20:52.338 --> 20:56.037
That's all. That's all
we're asking is just

20:56.167 --> 20:57.734
[raises voice] a little bit
of a demonstration

20:57.865 --> 20:59.562
for all our friends!

21:02.870 --> 21:05.133
You can do that for us, yes?

21:05.264 --> 21:10.051
And if you agree there, Billy,
we got you a little gift, hmm?

21:10.181 --> 21:12.096
It's brand-new.

21:12.227 --> 21:14.098
Very expensive.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.579
We think you're gonna like it.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.451
It's a double action.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.680
[glass clatters]

21:40.777 --> 21:44.781
[gun clicking]

21:54.965 --> 21:56.053
[Dolan]
Come on, everyone outside.

21:56.184 --> 21:57.881
We've got a little treat for ya.

22:01.015 --> 22:03.147
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:03.278 --> 22:05.976
our friend Billy here's
gonna demonstrate his gifts

22:06.107 --> 22:09.110
as a gunslinger
and the reason why we hired him

22:09.240 --> 22:11.634
to protect all
of our interests. Yeah?

22:11.765 --> 22:13.593
[applause]

22:13.723 --> 22:14.768
Come on, Billy!

22:23.820 --> 22:25.169
[Billy clears throat]

22:25.300 --> 22:28.042
[suspenseful music plays]

22:38.357 --> 22:43.187
[gunshots, glass breaking]

22:43.318 --> 22:46.016
[applause, laughter]

22:54.155 --> 22:56.853
âªâªâª

22:56.984 --> 22:59.769
[indistinct chatter]

22:59.900 --> 23:02.685
[gun clicks]

23:19.398 --> 23:23.010
[glass breaking, laughter]

23:23.140 --> 23:26.666
[applause]

23:37.198 --> 23:40.070
[gun cocking]

23:40.201 --> 23:42.072
[gun cocking]

23:54.258 --> 23:56.173
[gunshot, glass shatters]

23:56.304 --> 23:59.829
[fire crackling]

23:59.960 --> 24:02.702
âªâªâª

24:06.793 --> 24:07.881
[sighs]

24:08.011 --> 24:10.884
âªâªâª

24:25.159 --> 24:27.204
I told you! I told you not to
sell grain to Tunstall, right?

24:27.335 --> 24:29.859
You have a contract with us!

24:29.990 --> 24:30.860
Fucking Mexicans.

24:30.991 --> 24:33.820
[in Spanish]

24:44.265 --> 24:46.920
He says if he stops
selling to Tunstall,

24:47.050 --> 24:48.008
he can't afford
to feed his family.

24:48.138 --> 24:51.098
[Jesse]
Oh, is that right, Billy?

24:54.362 --> 24:55.972
-[grunts]
-What the hell?

24:56.103 --> 24:57.060
What are you doing?

24:57.191 --> 24:59.149
Enough talking. All right?

24:59.280 --> 25:02.283
I warned you. I warned you.
Mr. Murphy wants you to stop

25:02.413 --> 25:04.851
selling grain to Tunstall
right now.

25:04.981 --> 25:07.331
Got that?

25:07.462 --> 25:09.116
Otherwise, we're gonna
torch your farm,

25:09.246 --> 25:11.858
and we'll run you off
the territory.

25:11.988 --> 25:13.076
[grunts]

25:13.207 --> 25:16.079
You got that? [spits]

25:16.210 --> 25:18.255
This is my home.
I will never leave.

25:18.386 --> 25:19.909
-[gunshot]
-[woman] No! No!

25:20.040 --> 25:24.000
-No, no, no!
-[crying]

25:24.131 --> 25:25.001
No, no! Pat, put it away!
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

25:25.132 --> 25:31.007
[woman in Spanish]

25:31.138 --> 25:33.706
[woman sobbing]

25:45.282 --> 25:47.502
Fuck you!

25:47.633 --> 25:51.027
Billy, these people,
they don't mean anything!

25:51.158 --> 25:53.029
[Billy] Git up! Hah! Hah!

26:04.171 --> 26:05.346
Hey there, Charlie.

26:05.476 --> 26:07.391
Hey, George.

26:07.522 --> 26:10.133
What brings you up here?

26:10.264 --> 26:11.134
First of all, I wanted
to congratulate you

26:11.265 --> 26:12.571
on your marriage.

26:12.701 --> 26:14.137
Manuela's inside if you
want to meet her.

26:14.268 --> 26:17.097
[Manuela] No, I'm here.

26:17.227 --> 26:20.187
Manuela,
meet Mr. George Coe.

26:20.317 --> 26:23.451
He farms with his brother
on the other side of the valley.

26:23.582 --> 26:27.281
-George, meet Mrs. Bowdre.
-It's a pleasure, Mrs. Bowdre.

26:27.411 --> 26:30.414
You can call me Manuela
if you're a friend of Charlie's.

26:30.545 --> 26:32.242
Well, I wish I was here
for a friendly visit,

26:32.373 --> 26:35.071
but I'm here
'cause we got trouble.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.247
I'm talking about
the war that's brewing,

26:37.378 --> 26:39.598
the war
between Murphy and Tunstall.

26:39.728 --> 26:42.296
You really think
it will come to that, George?

26:42.426 --> 26:43.993
Sure looks that way to me.

26:44.124 --> 26:46.169
Yeah, both sides
are hirin' guns.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.954
And Murphy just put
the Seven Rivers Gang

26:48.084 --> 26:49.259
on his payroll.

26:49.390 --> 26:51.435
Well, okay,
Murphy's hiring killers.

26:51.566 --> 26:55.396
What's that to me, George?
You work for Tunstall. I don't.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.267
Forgive me.

26:57.398 --> 26:59.661
I'm afraid we're already
involved, Charlie.

26:59.792 --> 27:02.533
Murphy has already started
putting pressures on us farmers.

27:02.664 --> 27:05.972
They're only offering us half
the price now for our cattle.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.017
How can we survive like that?

27:08.148 --> 27:10.324
Would you consider
coming in with us?

27:10.454 --> 27:13.109
Maybe if we get enough guns,
Murphy will back off.

27:17.331 --> 27:19.376
I wouldn't ask you if
we weren't desperate, Charlie.

27:19.507 --> 27:23.511
George, I just can't do it.

27:23.642 --> 27:28.908
We've got a baby on the way.

27:29.038 --> 27:33.869
âªâªâª

27:35.436 --> 27:37.351
Riders coming in!

27:39.135 --> 27:41.790
Get up. We got company. Get up.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.315
What can we do for you,
gentlemen?

27:47.491 --> 27:51.234
We're sheriff's deputies.
Been sent here by Sheriff Brady.

27:51.365 --> 27:53.106
He wants to talk
to a person here

27:53.236 --> 27:55.630
about the recent murder
of a Mexican farmer.

27:55.761 --> 28:00.026
-Which person, exactly?
-His name is Pat Garrett.

28:08.382 --> 28:09.992
That's me.

28:14.170 --> 28:15.476
You arresting me?

28:15.606 --> 28:19.175
No. Sheriff Brady just wants
to talk to you.

28:21.438 --> 28:22.222
[sighs]

28:26.182 --> 28:29.533
Okay.

28:29.664 --> 28:30.404
I'll come with you.

28:39.413 --> 28:42.198
I'll get my horse.

29:10.357 --> 29:11.924
Mr. Garrett?

29:14.404 --> 29:17.625
I'm Sheriff Brady.

29:17.756 --> 29:22.456
I wanna thank you for agreeing
to come in today to talk to me.

29:22.586 --> 29:25.024
Can't say it's exactly
a pleasure, Sheriff.

29:25.154 --> 29:26.721
But I don't mind.

29:26.852 --> 29:29.463
We have witnesses
to say that you were present

29:29.593 --> 29:32.596
when the farmer, Manuel Garcia,
was shot and killed.

29:32.727 --> 29:35.425
Why were you there?

29:35.556 --> 29:39.429
Major Murphy, our boss...

29:39.560 --> 29:43.607
told me, Jesse Evans,
and Billy Antrim

29:43.738 --> 29:46.785
to go up there,
try to persuade Garcia,

29:46.915 --> 29:50.310
whatever his name was,
to stop cheating on him.

29:50.440 --> 29:51.572
He'd been double-crossing him

29:51.702 --> 29:53.269
with this English fellow,
John Tunstall.

29:53.400 --> 29:56.098
So, why was he shot?

29:58.492 --> 30:00.537
We were just trying
to persuade him

30:00.668 --> 30:04.324
when suddenly he got angry,

30:04.454 --> 30:09.416
said some stuff in Spanish,
pointed his gun right at Jesse.

30:09.546 --> 30:13.289
I mean, I had no alternative
but to shoot him.

30:13.420 --> 30:16.379
Otherwise, he would've
killed Jesse. Probably me, too.

30:16.510 --> 30:19.643
So it was self-defense?

30:19.774 --> 30:22.429
What else could it be, Sheriff?

30:24.431 --> 30:26.476
Can I go now?

30:31.481 --> 30:34.484
Unfortunately not.

30:34.615 --> 30:37.836
We have a real large Hispanic
community here in Lincoln,

30:37.966 --> 30:40.751
and they're real riled up
over this shooting.

30:40.882 --> 30:43.493
I need to avoid trouble
if I can.

30:49.543 --> 30:53.242
You should speak to Mr. Murphy.

30:53.373 --> 30:54.504
You can be sure
I'll be talkin' to him.

30:54.635 --> 30:57.551
But in the meantime...

30:57.681 --> 30:59.335
I'm gonna have
to lock you up here.

31:02.599 --> 31:04.253
Hope it's only
for the one night,

31:04.384 --> 31:05.602
but under the circumstances,

31:05.733 --> 31:07.996
there's really nothing else
I can do.

31:16.831 --> 31:21.009
[suspenseful music plays]

31:22.445 --> 31:26.623
[sighs]

31:26.754 --> 31:29.626
Get me a bottle of whiskey
and some cigars, would you?

31:29.757 --> 31:32.238
Sure.

31:40.507 --> 31:43.423
[door creaks]

33:58.949 --> 34:00.342
I am.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.478
You were with the Tunstall boys.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.610
That's right.

34:07.741 --> 34:10.178
This is a friend of mine,
Charlie Bowdre.

34:16.054 --> 34:19.622
Well, it was nice meeting you.

34:19.753 --> 34:21.320
Sorry it was
under these circumstances.

34:21.450 --> 34:24.714
Billy.

34:24.845 --> 34:28.501
John Tunstall is my boss,
and unlike Mr. Murphy,

34:28.631 --> 34:31.069
he's gonna be fair
to these people here.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.549
He's not gonna cheat them.
He's not gonna kill them.

34:33.680 --> 34:36.335
That's good to hear.

34:36.465 --> 34:37.727
Hey.

34:41.818 --> 34:44.038
So maybe you'd like
to meet Mr. Tunstall,

34:44.169 --> 34:47.563
and I'm sure he'd like
to meet you.

34:47.694 --> 34:51.959
I just came here
to pay my respects.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.571
And for what it's worth,
Manuel's killer's been arrested.

34:55.702 --> 34:57.051
[George] You know
that won't do anything.

34:57.182 --> 34:58.487
Murphy's got the law
in his pocket.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.495
[Charlie] You did something
remarkable today, Billy.

35:06.626 --> 35:10.499
I'd sure like to have you
on our side.

35:13.807 --> 35:15.504
Sorry for your loss.

35:25.035 --> 35:27.690
Feelings are running
real high in Lincoln.

35:27.821 --> 35:30.911
I spoke with your friend
Saturnino Baca.

35:31.041 --> 35:32.782
Even he says he can't
control the anger

35:32.913 --> 35:35.002
over this shooting.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.917
If we're not careful, we're
gonna have riots and burnings,

35:37.047 --> 35:39.920
like we had before.

35:40.050 --> 35:42.966
Maybe he goes away
for a while.

35:43.097 --> 35:46.666
Gets re-educated, comes back
over to your side as a lawman.

35:46.796 --> 35:48.842
Anything that takes him away
from here but gets him a job.

35:48.972 --> 35:50.800
Yeah?

35:50.931 --> 35:55.675
What about the people here?
What about the Mexicans?

35:55.805 --> 35:57.851
They're screaming for justice.

36:01.681 --> 36:03.987
All right.

36:04.118 --> 36:07.034
This is what you tell 'em.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.950
You tell 'em that he's been
sent to a higher court.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.952
Maybe in Santa Fe
or even further away,

36:12.082 --> 36:14.868
but a court that can
decide to hang him.

36:14.998 --> 36:16.522
That's what you tell 'em.

36:16.652 --> 36:19.438
[eerie music plays]

36:24.138 --> 36:25.487
[Frank] Is that Dolan?

36:29.970 --> 36:32.668
-[Dolan] Gentlemen.
-[Frank] Mr. Dolan.

36:35.671 --> 36:38.413
Mr. Murphy salutes your actions.

36:40.241 --> 36:44.680
We understand that
you had no other choice.

36:44.811 --> 36:48.597
This farmer...was deliberately
breaking his deal with us.

36:48.728 --> 36:51.034
Now, we warned him.

36:51.165 --> 36:53.646
He didn't listen.

36:53.776 --> 36:58.564
These Mexicans, they need
to learn the American way.

36:58.694 --> 37:02.045
'Cause our word is our bond.

37:02.176 --> 37:04.961
And if we make a deal,
we stick to it.

37:05.092 --> 37:06.920
So should they.

37:07.050 --> 37:09.923
Mr. Murphy
will take care of Pat.

37:10.053 --> 37:12.099
Now...

37:12.230 --> 37:13.840
The Major would like to give
his thanks to you all

37:13.970 --> 37:15.624
for coming out
to support his business.

37:15.755 --> 37:17.670
He appreciates it.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.889
So, here are some crates
of whiskey

37:20.020 --> 37:22.109
as a sign of his pleasure
and his support.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.677
-[laughter]
-[Frank] Yeah.

37:24.807 --> 37:26.983

Here you go, boys! Whoo!

37:28.289 --> 37:30.030
[Jesse] Give Mr. Murphy
our thanks.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.074
[Dolan] Oh, he'll get
your message, Jesse.

37:31.205 --> 37:33.729
All right, gents.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.644
[Jesse] Let's fill your boots,
boys. Whoo!

-[Dolan] Grab a case!
-[man] Whoo!

37:37.255 --> 37:40.083

Got me more of that.

38:34.355 --> 38:38.054
I didn't get your name
last time you were in.

38:49.196 --> 38:51.807
I need to speak to Tunstall.

38:51.938 --> 38:54.810
He's not here.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.725
Is there anything
I can help you with?

39:00.120 --> 39:02.514
Can I tell him
who's asking for him?

39:29.932 --> 39:32.761

40:14.412 --> 40:16.109
George Coe told me
that someone in the store

40:16.239 --> 40:18.111
was asking to speak
to Mr. Tunstall yesterday.

40:18.241 --> 40:20.983
I thought it might be you.

40:21.114 --> 40:23.116
Might've been.

40:23.246 --> 40:25.814
Mr. Tunstall's away,
but if you want, you can go

40:25.945 --> 40:27.250
and meet his lawyer,
Mr. McSween.

40:27.381 --> 40:29.122
And he can give you
a good account

40:29.252 --> 40:31.254
of what's actually
happening here in Lincoln.

40:31.385 --> 40:36.172
What is actually happening here
in Lincoln, Charlie?

40:36.303 --> 40:37.870
'Cause everybody around here

40:38.000 --> 40:40.786
seems to have
their own angle on it.

40:40.916 --> 40:42.178
What's yours?

40:45.399 --> 40:48.881
Well, I think we're
on the verge of a big war--

40:49.011 --> 40:51.274
a war between Murphy
and Tunstall.

40:51.405 --> 40:54.408
And as far as I can see,
one side is right,

40:54.539 --> 40:56.105
and the other side
is plain wrong.

41:07.943 --> 41:11.033
If I agree to meet with McSween,

41:11.164 --> 41:12.818
it has to be in secret.

41:12.948 --> 41:15.211
No one can know about it.

41:15.342 --> 41:21.043
You can tell McSween...
it's just a friendly visit.

41:21.174 --> 41:24.830
I'm not ready
to commit to anything.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.875
I still work for Murphy.

41:27.006 --> 41:28.747
I've got friends
in that camp.

41:31.140 --> 41:34.187
They're dangerous people,
Charlie.

Do not call me that.

It makes me feel old,
and I am not old.

to suggest you were.

to see you, Billy.

to leave Santa Fe

to act as the lawyer
for Major Lawrence Murphy.

46:32.354 --> 46:34.661
Unfortunately,
I soon discovered

46:34.792 --> 46:38.578
that Murphy himself
was a crook.

46:38.708 --> 46:40.580
And that, I believe,

is the same situation
