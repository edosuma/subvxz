00:02.065 --> 00:03.866
Tony: <i>Papi, I need you to get me out.</i>

00:03.870 --> 00:04.870
I ain't gonna make it here.

00:04.904 --> 00:05.838
I'm talking to the lawyer.

00:05.872 --> 00:07.106
I'm trying to get them to review the case.

00:07.140 --> 00:09.074
I need you to do more.

00:09.109 --> 00:10.075
I'm gonna give you some advice.

00:10.110 --> 00:11.009
And this is off the record.

00:11.044 --> 00:12.077
Get yourself a private defense attorney.

00:12.112 --> 00:14.213
That costs money. I don't
have that kind of money.

00:14.247 --> 00:16.181
He's your son. Get it.

00:16.216 --> 00:18.684
- Nancy: Did you know Barb bought a gun?
- Russ: No.

00:18.718 --> 00:19.651
When the man who killed my daughter

00:19.686 --> 00:22.087
got that joke of a sentence, I bought a gun.

00:22.122 --> 00:25.257
It was so easy to put the gun under my chin.

00:25.291 --> 00:28.193
Our lives weren't always this bad.

00:28.228 --> 00:29.762
Maybe you should remind her.

00:29.796 --> 00:31.463
- What?
- Russ: I found some photos at Matt's house

00:31.498 --> 00:32.898
I want to show you.

00:32.932 --> 00:35.467
And whatever good things the boys had,

00:35.502 --> 00:38.070
they had because of you.

00:38.104 --> 00:39.338
The prosecution has to prove

00:39.372 --> 00:42.274
that it's likely your brother
did what he's been accused of.

00:42.308 --> 00:44.443
Now, they do have Mr. Tontz's testimony.

00:44.477 --> 00:46.211
- They have the gun now.
- Aliyah: Not Carter's gun.

00:46.246 --> 00:48.447
They can't put a gun in his hand.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.482
Quinn: The statement of Aubry Taylor.

00:50.517 --> 00:52.584
This is the gun used to kill Matt Skokie.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.153
When Carter came back to the
car, did he have his gun?

00:54.187 --> 00:55.888
Yeah, sure.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.923
"Yeah, sure" or "yes"?

00:57.957 --> 00:59.458
Aubry: That's the gun.
But Carter didn't use it.

00:59.492 --> 01:01.560
I used it.

01:01.594 --> 01:04.763
I shot Matt. I shot his wife.

01:06.332 --> 01:08.100
[Keys jingle]

01:11.838 --> 01:15.007
Up, Tontz.

01:15.041 --> 01:17.009
What the hell?

01:17.043 --> 01:19.611
Up! Let's go.

01:19.646 --> 01:21.246

This was the vehicle that was lent to you

01:41.868 --> 01:44.636
by Tony GutlÃ©rrez.

01:44.671 --> 01:46.038
Yeah.

01:46.072 --> 01:49.441
A '73 Grand Prix.

01:49.475 --> 01:51.643
I mean, I don't know what kind it was.

01:51.678 --> 01:55.647
Look at the photo. Was this the car?

01:55.682 --> 01:57.916
Do we got to do this now?

01:59.886 --> 02:02.955
Yeah. That... That's the car.

02:02.989 --> 02:05.524
You stated you drove Carter to...

02:05.558 --> 02:08.327
Slauson Minimart.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.029
Nix went off on foot. He returned.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.898
He had this gun in hand.

02:12.932 --> 02:15.901
Yeah. That... That's it.

02:15.935 --> 02:17.903
This gun... .45 automatic.

02:17.937 --> 02:21.340
Yeah. That's the gun.

02:21.374 --> 02:23.709
He turned over to you this wallet,

02:23.743 --> 02:25.143
these credit cards.

02:25.178 --> 02:26.511
You recognize them?

02:26.546 --> 02:27.913
Those are them.

02:27.947 --> 02:30.716
Comes back, I drive him a couple blocks,

02:30.750 --> 02:31.950
I put him out of the car.

02:31.985 --> 02:35.687
Meth head with a gun, I didn't
want to be anywhere around him.

02:46.399 --> 02:48.734
Is this the same gun Mr. Nix had that night?

02:48.768 --> 02:50.936
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You're sure?

02:50.970 --> 02:53.939
Y-yeah, I'm sure! [Sighs]

02:53.973 --> 02:55.741
We have an issue.

02:55.775 --> 02:58.443
This wasn't the gun that
was used to kill Matt Skokie.

02:58.478 --> 03:00.245
This also is not the gun that was in

03:00.280 --> 03:02.114
Carter Nix's possession
when he was arrested.

03:02.148 --> 03:06.118
Do you understand what
the problem is, Hector?

03:06.152 --> 03:08.553
I mean, um, it looked like the gun.

03:08.588 --> 03:10.355
No, it didn't.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.190
You're giving testimony about a gun that has

03:12.225 --> 03:13.825
nothing to do with the crime.

03:16.829 --> 03:19.231
I mean, h-hold it. L-l-let me see it again.

03:19.265 --> 03:20.599
The fact that you lied about this...

03:20.633 --> 03:22.234
Now... n-n-now hol... Hold up.

03:22.268 --> 03:23.168
Everything else that you
said is inadmissible.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.437
I mean, I-I-it looked like that, all right?

03:25.471 --> 03:27.606
I-I... I mean, you're coming up
here in the middle of the night.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.174
- Come on.
- The deal is off.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.209
- No, no, no, no, no.
- The charges against you in Sinaloa are being reinstated.

03:31.244 --> 03:32.911
No, no, y-you signed the papers.

03:32.946 --> 03:35.948
- You are going back to Mexico.
- You can't... you can't... No, you can't go back on that!

03:35.982 --> 03:37.382
Palmer.

03:37.417 --> 03:38.317
[Beep]

03:38.351 --> 03:39.751
Palmer!

03:39.786 --> 03:40.953

03:40.987 --> 03:42.321

04:08.114 --> 04:12.651
You think Carter cares about
what you just did to yourself?

04:12.685 --> 04:15.487
We're not gonna let you
throw your life away.

04:15.521 --> 04:17.488
We're getting you another lawyer,

04:17.523 --> 04:19.291
somebody who knows what the
hell they're doing this time,

04:19.325 --> 04:22.661
somebody who can...
Aubry, do not shut me out.

04:22.695 --> 04:25.297
We're going to get you someone who...

04:25.331 --> 04:27.466
Aubry.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.334
Aubry!

04:33.539 --> 04:35.374
[Indistinct talking over P.A.]

04:38.544 --> 04:40.679
[Door closes]

04:40.713 --> 04:43.115
I'm not taking his lawyer.

04:43.149 --> 04:46.318
I'll take a public defender.

04:46.352 --> 04:48.320
This is all pointless.

04:48.354 --> 04:52.324
Then you really shouldn't
have gotten involved.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.693
You really should have
left everything alone.

04:54.727 --> 04:57.529
- A-and you're just going to...
- Just stayed in Milwaukee. Nobody wanted you here.

04:57.563 --> 04:59.131
You're going to hurt a lot of people

04:59.165 --> 05:01.633
trying to get back at me.

05:04.737 --> 05:08.907
It's always got to be about you.

05:08.941 --> 05:11.176
[Sighs]

05:16.082 --> 05:18.650
You were 11 years old when I realized that,

05:18.684 --> 05:22.487
one day, you were either
going to be dead or in jail.

05:24.424 --> 05:26.224
I'll make it through this

05:26.259 --> 05:30.028
because I was ready for it a long time ago.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.364
[Voice breaking] But your father...

05:32.398 --> 05:36.935
This will ruin him.

05:36.969 --> 05:40.739
So for him, see the lawyer,

05:40.773 --> 05:41.940
do as he says.

05:41.974 --> 05:45.377
Just humor him for a while

05:45.411 --> 05:48.213
until he can accept it like I have.

05:52.118 --> 05:53.518
[Door opens]

05:53.553 --> 05:54.719
Barb: What are you doing?

05:54.754 --> 05:56.555
Russ: I told Mark to be here
first thing in the morning.

05:56.589 --> 05:58.757
- First thing, and...
- Leave him alone.

05:58.791 --> 05:59.724
Well, you know, I mean, he's got...

05:59.759 --> 06:01.393
He's got all the time in the world for...

06:01.427 --> 06:02.627
For Tom and Eve, and he can't even...

06:02.662 --> 06:05.530
It's all right. Leave him alone. Just...

06:10.837 --> 06:13.605
[Sighs]

06:13.639 --> 06:15.607
Ms. Hanlon, Mr. Skokie?

06:15.641 --> 06:17.442
Yeah.

06:17.477 --> 06:20.445
Rick: It is the goal of our office
to be as inclusive as possible

06:20.480 --> 06:22.614
with the families of victims
throughout the process.

06:22.648 --> 06:25.250
- But go back to the...
- At the same time,

06:25.284 --> 06:28.053
there is always information
that has to remain confidential

06:28.087 --> 06:30.055
for the sake of the trial,
even as the situation changes.

06:30.089 --> 06:30.989
And what's changed?

06:31.023 --> 06:32.657
Again, I can't speak specifically about...

06:32.692 --> 06:34.292
W-well, then what the hell?

06:34.327 --> 06:35.560
- Let him speak, Russ.
- Y-you bring us in here...

06:35.595 --> 06:37.929
I'd love for him to tell us something.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.164
In the next few days,

06:39.198 --> 06:42.400
it's likely there will be fresh
allegations against your son.

06:42.435 --> 06:43.802
About what?

06:43.836 --> 06:46.638
I'd like to be prepared.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.807
- Dealing drugs...
- That lie... That has been...

06:48.841 --> 06:50.642
Attempted rape, domestic violence.

06:50.676 --> 06:51.843
Who's saying this?

06:51.878 --> 06:54.012
Aubry Taylor's confessed to the
murder and assault on Gwen.

06:54.046 --> 06:56.448
W-why would you believe any of that crap?

06:56.482 --> 06:58.016
We have a duty to vet her story.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.651
She does know things about the crime

06:59.685 --> 07:01.653
- only the perpetrator would know.
- Yeah, of course she knows.

07:01.687 --> 07:03.522
She was with the son of a
bitch who killed our son.

07:03.556 --> 07:05.757
That's what we're trying to determine.

07:07.827 --> 07:10.595
All these months, everything wasted.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.631
Thank you.

07:12.665 --> 07:15.200
"Thank you"? What are you...
What are you thanking him for?

07:15.234 --> 07:18.203
[Door open, closes] [Clears throat]

07:18.237 --> 07:20.005
What are you doing?

07:20.039 --> 07:22.207
Do you have any idea what
you're putting her through?

07:22.241 --> 07:24.609
- Mr. Skokie, we're doing you the courtesy of sitting down...
- Oh, "the courtesy"!

07:24.644 --> 07:26.845
With you and Ms. Hanlon.

07:28.848 --> 07:32.217
You're telling me my son's a
rapist and he beats women.

07:35.651 --> 07:37.646
No one has ever been straight with us.

07:37.646 --> 07:38.512
The lawyer we had before you,

07:38.546 --> 07:40.981
it was like he wasn't even on our side.

07:41.016 --> 07:43.584
Look [Sighs] there is a system.

07:43.618 --> 07:46.587
You hired me to help you,
and I think I can help you.

07:46.621 --> 07:48.022
Will I get to go home? [Sighs]

07:48.056 --> 07:50.024
That's what we're working toward.

07:50.058 --> 07:54.595
Okay, couple things. I moved
the case to family court.

07:54.629 --> 07:56.397
Judges are traditionally more lenient.

07:56.431 --> 07:59.600
Their primary goal is to reunite
minors with their families.

07:59.634 --> 08:01.001
When you're in front of the judge,

08:01.036 --> 08:02.069
you're gonna have to allocute.

08:02.103 --> 08:03.704
Do you know what that means?

08:03.738 --> 08:05.706
You're gonna have to give a full explanation

08:05.740 --> 08:06.974
of these new charges,

08:07.008 --> 08:08.945
what happened when you
assaulted this other young man.

08:08.945 --> 08:09.810
No.

08:09.810 --> 08:10.945
Your son really needs to
start taking this seriously.

08:10.979 --> 08:13.180
You need to drop this hard act and listen.

08:13.214 --> 08:15.215
I'm not trying to be hard.

08:16.818 --> 08:20.187
They have you on video beating someone.

08:20.221 --> 08:22.790
If you won't give cause and show remorse,

08:22.824 --> 08:25.192
then it makes everything else
we have to do more difficult.

08:25.226 --> 08:27.594
I'll say I'm sorry for what
did, that it's my fault.

08:27.629 --> 08:29.596
That's showing remorse, right?

08:29.631 --> 08:31.799
Then I don't have to say nothing else.

08:31.833 --> 08:33.400
Character witnesses...

08:33.434 --> 08:35.602
We need some people to
speak on Tony's behalf.

08:35.636 --> 08:38.038
Uh, the people in the community, they...

08:38.073 --> 08:39.974
They don't look at my
family too good right now.

08:40.008 --> 08:42.409
All these things the judge
takes into consideration...

08:42.443 --> 08:44.211
Character, stability.

08:44.245 --> 08:46.413
The fact that you've owned
your business for 20 years

08:46.448 --> 08:48.682
is a major plus.

08:50.085 --> 08:51.652
I sold my shop.

08:51.686 --> 08:53.087
Why?!

08:56.458 --> 08:59.426
I'm trying to get you home.

08:59.461 --> 09:01.495
There's a level of urgency right now.

09:01.529 --> 09:04.298
This entire case is diseased.

09:04.332 --> 09:06.300
People want it resolved quickly.

09:06.334 --> 09:08.736
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

09:08.770 --> 09:11.305
The judge is looking
for a reason to put Tony

09:11.339 --> 09:13.140
back in your hands.

09:13.174 --> 09:16.510
You need to give him one.

09:16.544 --> 09:18.379
Okay.

09:27.155 --> 09:29.323
Okay.

09:29.357 --> 09:31.759
Carter's girlfriend is the one
who confessed to the crime.

09:31.793 --> 09:33.327
I mean, that... that bitch lies.

09:33.361 --> 09:34.528
Don't they got her lying on other stuff?

09:34.562 --> 09:36.130
She also looks good for the crime.

09:36.164 --> 09:38.165
They have her trying to
slash some guy's throat,

09:38.199 --> 09:39.767
and they have a video from a liquor store

09:39.801 --> 09:40.701
near where they found the gun.

09:40.735 --> 09:42.369
Yeah, I mean, t-that don't mean she did it.

09:42.404 --> 09:43.804
I mean... I mean, talk to somebody.

09:43.838 --> 09:45.005
I've reached out to the prosecutors...

09:45.040 --> 09:46.073
I mean, well, reach out again!

09:46.107 --> 09:48.542
They're not interested in
anything we have to say.

09:48.576 --> 09:52.346
Your credibility is blown.
You shouldn't have lied.

09:52.380 --> 09:53.347
I didn't lie.

09:53.381 --> 09:55.783
Hector... [Sighs]

09:55.817 --> 09:58.352
L-l-l-look, I mean... I mean,

09:58.386 --> 10:01.789
I told him the same story
every time, from the jump,

10:01.823 --> 10:04.158
word for word... That got
to count for something.

10:04.192 --> 10:05.359
Did you lie about the gun?

10:05.393 --> 10:07.361
I...

10:07.395 --> 10:09.196
They... they come up here
in the middle of the night,

We want my brother fully exonerated.

We want him released right now.

13:29.097 --> 13:33.066
"What about the gun? Did he have a gun?

13:33.101 --> 13:38.238

23:39.894 --> 23:42.295
You know, it was a good experiment.

23:48.069 --> 23:53.673
I sold my shop so I could get a lawyer.

23:53.708 --> 23:55.842

taking myself out of this.

our son is gonna go free,

Yes, I have.

This competency evaluation is

Yes.

26:41.952 --> 26:44.721
Let's start with your upbringing.

26:44.755 --> 26:48.124
You were in foster care.

26:48.159 --> 26:51.127
I was in until I was about 8.

26:51.162 --> 26:54.731
Wasn't a real good system, the one I was in.

26:54.765 --> 26:57.367
Do you need me to get
graphic about the abuse?

26:57.401 --> 26:59.135
Did you abuse yourself?

26:59.170 --> 27:01.437
I had people doing it for me.

27:01.472 --> 27:05.441
Did you abuse yourself
with drugs or alcohol?

27:05.476 --> 27:08.244
Did I put my brain to sleep
so I didn't have to be

27:08.279 --> 27:10.713
aware of the... that was happening to me?

27:12.650 --> 27:15.752
You were taken out of the
system by the Taylor family?

27:15.786 --> 27:18.321
- Yes.
- Did the abuse continue?

27:18.355 --> 27:20.390
Are you talking about my brother?

27:20.424 --> 27:22.959
I'm talking about you.

27:22.993 --> 27:25.161
Your environment improved.

27:25.196 --> 27:26.329
Did you still feel a need...

27:26.363 --> 27:29.966
Things didn't just get better.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.335
They don't just get better.

27:32.369 --> 27:35.738
But there were issues. You
knew there were issues.

27:35.773 --> 27:37.941
My issue was that there were things

27:37.975 --> 27:42.145
I couldn't fix or make right, control.

27:42.179 --> 27:44.747
And you wanted control?

27:44.782 --> 27:47.784
There were things in your
life you wanted to control?

27:50.387 --> 27:53.523
I wanted to be able to go to the bathroom

27:53.557 --> 27:56.159
or go to bed without having somebody

27:56.193 --> 27:59.963
try to do things to me.

27:59.997 --> 28:02.465
I wanted to be with who I wanted,

28:02.499 --> 28:04.033
not people who owned me,

28:04.068 --> 28:07.036
'cause they filled out adoption papers.

28:07.071 --> 28:10.039
I want life the way I want life.

28:10.074 --> 28:11.441
And if I couldn't have it, I...

28:11.475 --> 28:13.209
You created it.

28:13.244 --> 28:15.778
You created it in your head.

28:15.813 --> 28:19.382
Created it around you.

28:19.416 --> 28:23.253
Do you willfully bend truth
to fit your perspective?

28:24.588 --> 28:27.190
[Scoffs] No.

28:27.224 --> 28:30.560
That's what liars do.

28:30.594 --> 28:33.396
I see things the way I see them,

28:33.430 --> 28:37.367
and everybody else needs to get with that.

28:37.401 --> 28:39.202
It's believed you made a statement

28:39.236 --> 28:41.571
about your brother molesting
you to disqualify you

28:41.605 --> 28:46.042
from being a reliable witness
to protect your boyfriend.

28:47.411 --> 28:48.811
Maybe.

28:48.846 --> 28:52.315
Are you trying to protect Carter now?

28:52.349 --> 28:54.550
Is that your intention with this confession?

28:57.521 --> 29:01.457
My intention is to own up.

29:08.932 --> 29:13.336
I'm, um, Alonzo GutlÃ©rrez.

29:13.370 --> 29:18.408
I'm Anthony... Uh, Tony's, dad.

29:18.442 --> 29:22.011
He was always a good kid.

29:22.046 --> 29:27.250
Didn't have it easy growing
up without his mom, but...

29:29.586 --> 29:32.388
I guess a lot of kids have it that way.

29:35.092 --> 29:38.628
But Tony, uh... he, uh...

29:38.662 --> 29:42.465
Well, he was always helping out at home

29:42.499 --> 29:44.467
and, uh... and with me at work.

29:44.501 --> 29:47.070
Uh...

29:47.104 --> 29:48.905
He, uh...

29:51.608 --> 29:55.411
He's a really good boy, Your Honor.

29:55.446 --> 29:57.780
And he's helpful. He's very, very helpful.

29:57.815 --> 30:00.616
He always checks in on his <i>tÃ­a,</i> his aunt,

30:00.651 --> 30:01.984
when I have to work weekends.

30:02.019 --> 30:05.621
No, Tony is a good kid, Your Honor.

30:05.656 --> 30:08.624
And we're all gonna watch over him,

30:08.659 --> 30:11.661
make sure that he doesn't
get into any more trouble.

30:11.695 --> 30:16.499
Like everything my Uncle said, my dad...

30:16.533 --> 30:20.103
Tony's a good kid.

30:20.137 --> 30:23.306
He's always helping his family.

30:23.340 --> 30:25.508
My dad even trusted Tony enough

30:25.542 --> 30:28.378
to work on cars sometimes by himself.

30:29.747 --> 30:32.349
He's...

30:38.255 --> 30:41.591
This isn't just on Tony.

30:41.625 --> 30:44.227
This is on me, too.

30:44.261 --> 30:49.032
I was the one messing up,
not listening to my dad's rules.

30:49.066 --> 30:50.734
I'd be drinking,

30:50.768 --> 30:54.771
having guys over when <i>papi</i> was at work.

30:56.340 --> 30:58.942
And I told Tony not to tell on me.

31:01.178 --> 31:05.382
Tony was always looking out for me...

31:05.416 --> 31:08.218
Making sure I didn't get busted.

31:10.154 --> 31:13.556
That's how he is.

31:13.591 --> 31:18.161
He just wants everybody to be happy.

31:18.195 --> 31:23.233
When me and <i>papi</i> would fight,
it would really bother Tony.

31:24.602 --> 31:28.605
So, to keep things cool,
he would lie for me.

31:31.308 --> 31:33.676
I didn't know I was making
Tony feel like he had to

31:33.711 --> 31:35.512
protect me all the time.

31:35.546 --> 31:38.581
But he did.

31:41.819 --> 31:46.189
That's why he beat up Joaquin.

31:46.223 --> 31:50.193
[Voice breaking] He was doing
what he always did...

31:50.227 --> 31:53.196

31:54.999 --> 31:56.533
[Sobbing]

31:56.567 --> 31:59.402
He came at me.

32:01.238 --> 32:03.273
And the way he beat me...

32:05.910 --> 32:08.144
I didn't deserve that.

32:11.382 --> 32:13.950
I should have told somebody.

32:13.984 --> 32:15.718
I should have told my dad.

32:15.753 --> 32:19.322
But I was afraid.

32:19.356 --> 32:24.194
I should have told the police,
but I saw what they did to Tony.

32:26.397 --> 32:29.799
So I kept it hid.

32:29.834 --> 32:31.501
And Tony,

32:31.535 --> 32:35.538
he only did what he did to protect me.

32:37.541 --> 32:41.311
The only reason why he never
said anything about any of this,

32:41.345 --> 32:45.181
he was still trying to protect me.

32:47.852 --> 32:50.587
So I'm asking you,

32:50.621 --> 32:53.389
put some of the blame on me.

32:53.424 --> 32:57.227
Put some of the blame on Joaquin.

32:57.261 --> 32:59.362
It's not right to put all
of this on my brother.

your anger and your guilt.

the reason why I came here.

- Moving on... moving on or running off?

you want to be better than me?

to make a confession,

37:42.565 --> 37:44.933
Mark: Live your life.

37:44.968 --> 37:46.902
I'll tell you the same thing I told Russ.

37:46.936 --> 37:48.737
Just live your life.

37:48.771 --> 37:51.340
I don't know what that is right now.

37:51.374 --> 37:53.742
[Inhales deeply]

37:53.776 --> 37:56.878
Well, I think you're
free of a lot of things.

37:56.913 --> 37:58.513
You've been holding up Matt for a long time,

37:58.548 --> 37:59.480
Does being free...

37:59.480 --> 38:03.068
And I don't think that
you were ever really over or beyond Russ.

38:03.068 --> 38:04.786
Are you telling me to be free of you?

38:04.821 --> 38:07.756
Because you not wanting to be
around isn't the same as me...

38:07.790 --> 38:09.391
I know that you would like
to maintain... [sighs]

38:09.425 --> 38:10.792
I'd like to be in your life.

38:10.827 --> 38:13.095
Yeah, and I don't know how to get there.

38:16.833 --> 38:19.635
And everything that is wrong

38:19.669 --> 38:23.639
is because we're trying
to hold on to each other.

38:23.673 --> 38:26.041
Now, for me, when I got here, I was...

38:26.075 --> 38:27.976
I was ready to throw you all away,

38:28.011 --> 38:31.146
and that's messed up, and I know that.

38:31.180 --> 38:32.581
But I still...

38:32.615 --> 38:35.150
[Sighs]

38:35.184 --> 38:39.288
I'm ready to let go.

38:42.759 --> 38:46.895
Now, I'll always respect what
you were trying to do for us,

38:46.929 --> 38:49.931
and even...

38:49.966 --> 38:51.900
Appreciate it in some way.

38:51.934 --> 38:53.935
But no love?

38:56.105 --> 38:58.907
Not love.

38:58.941 --> 39:01.343
[Exhales deeply]

39:01.377 --> 39:04.146
I'm not asking because I want to hear it.

39:04.180 --> 39:07.783
I'm...

39:07.817 --> 39:11.219
I guess I'm making sure it's not there.

39:26.002 --> 39:27.135
[Metal detector beeping]

39:27.170 --> 39:28.970
Hey, what's going on?

39:29.005 --> 39:31.006
[Indistinct conversations]

39:49.859 --> 39:52.828
Carter: What's happening?

39:52.862 --> 39:55.263
Can you tell me what's happening?

39:57.900 --> 40:00.769
It's over? I'm out for good?

40:05.108 --> 40:08.076
How?

40:08.111 --> 40:11.713
Don't ask questions.

40:11.748 --> 40:13.782
Just give praise.

40:44.947 --> 40:46.982
[Door opens]

41:01.764 --> 41:04.065
Thank you.

41:08.638 --> 41:10.238
Aubry Taylor?

41:13.943 --> 41:16.696
You are charged with
first-degree felony murder

41:16.746 --> 41:18.881
with the use of a firearm,

41:18.915 --> 41:21.083
causing death or great bodily injury,

41:21.117 --> 41:23.886
enhancement with special circumstances.

41:23.920 --> 41:26.688
I have a notation that you
have willfully confessed

41:26.723 --> 41:29.525
to these crimes and that the confession

41:29.559 --> 41:32.094
is admissible as evidence.

41:32.128 --> 41:34.696
How do you plead to the charges?

41:39.102 --> 41:41.503
Guilty.
