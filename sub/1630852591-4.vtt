00:18.351 --> 00:22.272
<i> Eleanor Wall was</i>
<i>one of the most important female artists</i>

00:22.355 --> 00:24.149
<i>in postwar Europe.</i>

00:24.232 --> 00:26.693
<i>Born in London in 1928,</i>

00:26.776 --> 00:30.864
<i>Eleanor was part of a movement</i>
<i>called Spirit Receivers,</i>

00:30.947 --> 00:35.160
<i>a radical group of abstract artists</i>
<i>who explored roles as mediums</i>

00:35.243 --> 00:40.790
<i>for supernatural messages</i>
<i>from the spirit realm and beyond.</i>

00:40.874 --> 00:44.753
<i>In 1974, Eleanor and her sister Cassandra</i>

00:44.836 --> 00:48.840
<i>moved to New York City</i>
<i>and established the Wall Galleries,</i>

00:48.923 --> 00:53.344
<i>where they exhibited the work</i>
<i>of Spirit Receivers living in America.</i>

00:54.012 --> 00:58.016
<i>Now, Christie's is offering</i>
<i>one of the most mesmerizing collections</i>

00:58.099 --> 01:01.227
<i>to come on the market in recent years.</i>

01:01.978 --> 01:07.400
<i>All of the items in the Wall collection</i>
<i>were carefully curated by the artist,</i>

01:07.484 --> 01:10.528
<i>who felt a close spiritual</i>
<i>or personal connection</i>

01:10.612 --> 01:14.616
<i>to each object</i>
<i>that served as an inspiration to her work.</i>

01:16.576 --> 01:21.247
<i>Object 6758-A:</i>
<i>Spirit photograph by William Mumler.</i>

01:21.331 --> 01:25.794
<i>"The Medium Fanny Conant</i>
<i>and her Lost Brother, 1868."</i>

01:25.877 --> 01:28.963
<i>Object 6788-B:</i>

01:29.047 --> 01:33.802
<i>Tuning forks, Bavarian provenance,</i>
<i>14th century.</i>

01:33.885 --> 01:36.596
<i>Object 5767-A:</i>

01:36.679 --> 01:38.389
<i>Ladies' comet pin.</i>

01:38.473 --> 01:41.476
<i>Platinum, diamonds, and Kharonite.</i>

01:41.559 --> 01:44.854
<i>Object 7658-B:</i>

01:44.938 --> 01:48.650
<i>Bowl, inlaid with human teeth and tiles.</i>

01:48.733 --> 01:52.529
<i>Portrait of Cassandra Wall,</i>
<i>by Eleanor Wall,</i>

01:52.612 --> 01:56.282
<i>acrylic on canvas, 1974.</i>

02:47.167 --> 02:50.044
<i>Stay out.</i>

04:02.075 --> 04:04.077
<i> This is Mark Higgins</i>
<i>with </i>Mystery Signals.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.330
<i>Please leave a message and I'll</i>
<i>return your call as soon as possible.</i>

04:07.413 --> 04:09.666
Hey, uh, it's me. Um…

04:10.208 --> 04:12.543
So, I… I can't get in the basement.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.004
None of your Reddit tips work,

04:15.088 --> 04:17.757
so I'm just punching random numbers in.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.301
Um, I'm gonna text you
a picture of the keypad.

04:20.385 --> 04:25.515
Can you find an actual live person
who knows how to hack this model?

04:26.099 --> 04:27.100
All right. Um…

04:27.850 --> 04:29.352
I'll call you back later.

04:55.920 --> 04:56.963
Dan?

04:59.632 --> 05:01.968
It's Dan, right?

05:02.885 --> 05:04.012
How'd you…

05:05.138 --> 05:06.347
How'd you get here?

05:14.981 --> 05:16.065
I don't know.

05:20.820 --> 05:21.946
You tell me.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.008
<i> Dan.</i>

05:45.803 --> 05:47.055
Everything all right?

05:55.021 --> 05:56.147
What time is it?

05:56.814 --> 05:58.441
A little after 8:00.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.652
You were just standing there.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.003
Hello?

06:19.087 --> 06:20.755
<i>You ever have a paper route, Dan?</i>

06:20.838 --> 06:23.049
<i>Best thing about a paper route</i>
<i>is the routine.</i>

06:23.132 --> 06:24.509
<i>Every morning at 4:30,</i>

06:24.592 --> 06:28.012
<i>I had to be at the distro center</i>
<i>to pick up my copies of the</i> Gazette.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.555
<i>By 5:00, I was on the bike.</i>

06:29.639 --> 06:32.433
<i>By 6:15, everyone had their papers,</i>

06:32.517 --> 06:36.646
<i>every delivery complete by the time</i>
<i>my neighbors left for the day.</i>

06:36.729 --> 06:38.398
<i>My job was done.</i>

06:39.440 --> 06:41.526
<i>You didn't upload anything today.</i>

06:41.609 --> 06:42.819
Uh, I lost track of time.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.904
<i>Feeling all right?</i>
<i>Should I send a doc</i>tor out

06:44.987 --> 06:48.241
<i>-B-12 shot always gives me energy.</i>
No shots. I'll get back to it.

07:08.177 --> 07:09.512
<i> Hot tea?</i>

07:09.595 --> 07:11.055
<i>Juice?</i>

07:11.764 --> 07:15.184
<i>Chicken soup with those pork balls</i>
<i>from that Chinese place?</i>

07:15.268 --> 07:17.895
<i>Flintstone vitamins, but only the Barneys?</i>

07:17.979 --> 07:19.188
<i> I'm fine.</i>

07:20.022 --> 07:22.525
Maybe I should make you a healing mixtape.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.612
With bird sounds and Enya

07:27.697 --> 07:29.532
and <i>Koyaanisqatsi.</i>

07:29.615 --> 07:32.452
I think I'm just gonna
stick to the exercises.

07:32.535 --> 07:33.953
Exercises?

07:34.036 --> 07:37.331
Like, when I start to feel anxious,
I count backwards in Japanese.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.209
The doctor says it's like
giving a dog a chew toy.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.795
Yeah, I've got one of those exercises too.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.256
It really helps me.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.508
<i>Secret of NIMH?</i>

07:47.592 --> 07:50.553
I have homework.
Extra credit for science class.

07:54.056 --> 07:58.519
<i>Cometology, Volume Six:</i>
<i>A Catalog of Comets.</i>

08:01.230 --> 08:04.692
<i>Aren't comets supposed to bring about</i>
<i>end-times or something?</i>

08:04.775 --> 08:06.360
<i>Do you think that's science?</i>

08:06.861 --> 08:07.778
<i>Maybe.</i>

08:08.988 --> 08:10.823
I'm writing about Comet Kharon.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.201
It used to be, like, really famous.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.037
There were songs about it
and everything, but…

08:16.996 --> 08:20.208
Sometimes comets start breaking
into smaller and smaller pieces

08:20.291 --> 08:22.835
and they just… disappear.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.087
Sounds lonely.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.798
They're space rocks, not people.

08:30.259 --> 08:33.095
Anyway, it's supposed to be visible
in a couple weeks.

08:33.638 --> 08:37.975
Oh, Samuel got me that new telescope,
see? An Orion SkyQuest.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.436
We're gonna watch for it together.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.604
-Whoa.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.565
Mel, we had that interview.

08:45.650 --> 08:46.609
Hi, kid.

08:46.692 --> 08:47.944
Hi.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.445
Are you gonna be okay alone?

08:50.446 --> 08:51.531
I'll be fine.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.536
Holy shit. Are those teeth?

08:57.328 --> 09:01.916
That was a barter.
For Eleanor's <i>Spirit Raven Number Seven</i>.

09:01.999 --> 09:05.586
Exquisite piece.
Much more valuable than the bowl.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.005
But Eleanor insisted.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.011
Wasn't she beautiful?

09:16.639 --> 09:18.724
When did you and your sister
move into the Visser?

09:18.808 --> 09:21.477
1974. Eleanor found the apartment.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.397
She thought it was very spiritual.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.232
This place?

09:27.358 --> 09:28.526
Spiritual?

09:29.902 --> 09:31.904
She always saw beyond, my dear.

09:32.655 --> 09:36.701
-And of course the rent was right.
-This stuff must have cost a fortune.

09:36.784 --> 09:40.746
Oh, those?
Yes, mid-century. Irreplaceable.

09:40.830 --> 09:41.789
What's this?

09:42.832 --> 09:44.041
Fire sale?

09:44.125 --> 09:46.919
After she died,
I put everything up for auction.

09:47.503 --> 09:50.172
But I couldn't bring myself
to follow through.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.216
Eleanor loved her things.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.761
And now I just sell a few pieces
when the need arises.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.390
<i>This stuff is just amazing.</i>

10:17.033 --> 10:18.284
One of a kind.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.662
Estonian, I believe.

10:22.663 --> 10:23.914
What's inside?

10:23.998 --> 10:24.874
A sculpture.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.960
It's quite a piece,
but I'm afraid I've misplaced the key.

10:30.588 --> 10:35.009
Miss Wall, is there anything about
the Visser that <i>you</i> find spiritual?

10:35.092 --> 10:36.969
Cassandra, please.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.179
Um…

10:38.804 --> 10:42.850
Or maybe some of the other residents
find it spiritual too?

10:45.019 --> 10:47.271
Like the group that meets
in the community room?

10:49.815 --> 10:51.859
You're asking about the cult.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.779
Hey, Cass?

10:54.862 --> 10:55.821
Is this you?

10:56.322 --> 10:59.867
Oh, that was painted
in this very apartment.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.997
Eleanor had such a way of seeing me.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.630
<i>She belonged to a group of artists</i>

11:12.713 --> 11:15.633
who called themselves Spirit Receivers.

11:15.716 --> 11:21.097
They believed mysterious beings were
speaking through them to manifest art.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.307
And beauty. And truth.

11:24.058 --> 11:27.645
Some people called them a cult.
Is that what you were asking about?

11:29.021 --> 11:29.897
No.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.607
No, I wasn't.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.443
You know, it really was something
to watch her create.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.572
No idea what
her brush stroke would reveal.

11:39.115 --> 11:43.077
No certainty of who or what
she was communicating with.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.872
We can't begin to imagine
the worlds which lie undiscovered.

11:47.456 --> 11:50.584
I only hope my Eleanor
is waiting in one of them.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.295
Is that the same pendant?

11:53.879 --> 11:54.880
Yes.

11:55.881 --> 11:56.966
It's Kharonite.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.138
It's very rare.

12:04.473 --> 12:06.475
They say it came from a comet.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.229
The blacks are incredible.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.065
Miss Eleanor mixed all her own paint.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.402
Oh, wait a moment.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.658
Yes, here.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.038
Take this.

12:29.331 --> 12:32.501
Better it get some use than waste away.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.669
Seriously?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.755
Eleanor would want you to have it.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.757
Thank you.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.885
-Oh, maybe Cass knew your mom.
-Anabelle.

12:40.968 --> 12:43.429
Look, if you want something,
you ask for it, right?

12:43.512 --> 12:47.475
She's looking for her deadbeat mom,
Julia Bennett.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.643
Does that ring a bell?

12:56.108 --> 12:58.569
Oh, you know, my memory's not what it was.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.115
I'm having a dinner party here
tomorrow night,

13:03.199 --> 13:05.034
a thank-you for a buyer.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.160
Why don't you come?

13:06.243 --> 13:08.162
A lot of old-time residents will be here.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.790
Surely someone will know your Julia.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.252
Okay.

13:17.004 --> 13:19.840
Maybe I can conjure something
with this paint.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.426
Like Eleanor and her ghost strokes.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.639
She's obviously
not over her sister's death.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.224
Melody.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.686
They were lovers, not sisters.

13:33.687 --> 13:34.730
What?

13:34.814 --> 13:37.942
Yeah, Cassandra took her last name
so they could pass.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.862
Eleanor drowned herself.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.864
You know, in the Hudson.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.951
Took a week for the body to wash up.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.546
Oh, hi.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.215
Ah. There you are.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.551
Have you-- Have you been up to see Jess?

14:03.634 --> 14:05.010
Yeah, I, uh…

14:05.970 --> 14:07.888
took her a care package.

14:07.972 --> 14:11.100
Candies and magazines and stuff.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.018
Thanks.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.687
For what you did.

14:15.437 --> 14:19.733
For stopping it and…
for getting her to a real doctor.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.569
I should've done it sooner.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.363
I was, uh…

14:24.446 --> 14:28.909
I was just wondering
if you still had that key, or--

14:28.993 --> 14:31.787
Oh, shit. Yeah, I'll get it.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.210
It's Anabelle, right?

14:40.129 --> 14:43.757
Oh, no.
Are you… Are you a filmmaker too?

14:44.383 --> 14:46.176
Here's what I'm curious about.

14:47.219 --> 14:51.515
What's with the, uh,
after-hours Satanic choir practice?

14:52.391 --> 14:53.475
I'm sorry?

14:54.143 --> 14:55.811
The community room a couple nights ago?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.272
You and a bunch of friends singing

14:58.355 --> 15:01.233
all the songs that got cut
from <i>Jesus Christ Superstar?</i>

15:01.317 --> 15:03.861
Melody couldn't sleep
and she went on a walkabout--

15:03.944 --> 15:05.905
Yeah, Tamara was… She was feeling…

15:07.531 --> 15:11.660
Well, she didn't… she didn't think
that her performance went very well,

15:11.744 --> 15:14.455
and so she just wanted
to try out some new material, so--

15:14.538 --> 15:15.915
New material, right.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.208
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

15:20.711 --> 15:21.712
Um…

15:21.795 --> 15:24.924
She's my ex, and, um…

15:26.091 --> 15:29.595
we had too much of that terrible red wine
that she drinks and--

15:29.678 --> 15:30.721
It's fine.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.432
It doesn't matter.

15:40.564 --> 15:41.774
It does matter.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.401
It does.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.778
I'm sorry.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.406
And, uh…

16:00.584 --> 16:02.044
<i>Let it go, Anabelle.</i>

16:03.212 --> 16:04.338
<i>Let it go.</i>

16:17.142 --> 16:17.977
Hello?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.340
Get in and close the door.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.770
Wanna hear a ghost story?

17:02.563 --> 17:03.814
Ghosts aren't real.

17:04.481 --> 17:05.941
Dad says they are.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.443
He does?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.403
He told you that?

17:09.486 --> 17:11.238
He says they're everywhere.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.408
Have you ever seen one?

17:14.491 --> 17:16.035
All the time.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.119
Haven't you?

17:20.706 --> 17:22.166
Don't be afraid.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.668
They're just… lost.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.213
And don't know where to go.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.468
Did you write
in all these notebooks?

18:16.470 --> 18:17.346
No.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.516
Who did?

18:22.601 --> 18:23.936
I don't know.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.318
"Monday, April 23rd."

18:31.401 --> 18:33.737
"At the courthouse,
Lavinia introduces Colin

18:33.821 --> 18:35.906
to the new attorney representing Delia."

18:35.989 --> 18:38.826
"Creighton, from an unnamed
South American country,

18:38.909 --> 18:42.538
specializes in defending
demon-possessed individuals

18:42.621 --> 18:44.706
charged with assault and battery."

18:45.415 --> 18:48.043
Someone is a big soap opera fan.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.339
Um…

18:52.881 --> 18:54.424
What are you doing here?

18:56.677 --> 18:57.553
I don't know.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.849
Where did you get that?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.602
It was here on the bed.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.273
No, no, that's impossible. I…

19:10.691 --> 19:13.026
I've never been in here.
This isn't my room.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.154
What is it?

19:16.113 --> 19:16.947
Nothing.

19:17.698 --> 19:18.657
It's, uh…

19:19.408 --> 19:20.492
It's a tape

19:21.076 --> 19:22.369
my dad made for me.

19:26.206 --> 19:29.376
He used to collect 16-millimeter films.

19:29.459 --> 19:33.881
Picked them up at flea markets,
you know, like, uh, <i>Flash Gordon</i>.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.383
<i>Jason and the Argonauts.</i>

19:38.427 --> 19:40.596
<i>The 7th Voyage of Sinbad.</i>

19:41.221 --> 19:42.222
Um…

19:44.057 --> 19:47.352
Did you ever see <i>The Skeleton Dance?</i>

19:48.812 --> 19:52.774
The one where the skeletons
come out of the graves?

19:54.318 --> 19:56.028
-Anyway…

19:56.653 --> 19:57.696
Um…

19:59.323 --> 20:02.618
he made a tape
out of my favorite parts and…

20:03.952 --> 20:05.621
gave it to me for my birthday.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.458
What happened to it?

20:09.541 --> 20:11.877
I smashed it with a baseball bat.

20:12.878 --> 20:13.962
Oh…

20:15.881 --> 20:17.090
After he died, I…

20:18.133 --> 20:21.345
I found out he wasn't
who I thought he was.

20:21.428 --> 20:22.930
But this was the only…

20:25.057 --> 20:28.685
Yeah, this was the only thing
I had from him, so I kept the pieces.

20:35.150 --> 20:37.945
My mother left me in a church
when I was a baby.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.866
With this ring around my neck.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.621
I threw it away so many times, but…

20:49.122 --> 20:51.166
I kept going back for it.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.962
I guess I thought
that if I held onto it, then…

20:57.506 --> 20:59.716
maybe I'd be able to forgive her someday.

21:00.384 --> 21:01.343
Did you?

21:03.220 --> 21:04.763
Not yet, I guess.

21:09.601 --> 21:10.894
What about you?

21:20.362 --> 21:21.321
Um…

21:24.366 --> 21:27.327
Actually, you know him.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.541
Your father?

21:33.625 --> 21:34.835
Steven Turner.

21:37.587 --> 21:39.047
<i>Doctor</i> Turner?

21:41.258 --> 21:43.260
No. No, I don't think…

21:44.803 --> 21:48.348
No, that can't be right
because his son is only…

21:49.725 --> 21:51.977
Anyway, you just said
your father's dead, so--

21:52.060 --> 21:53.812
Dr. Turner is definitely…

21:57.691 --> 21:58.525
Dan?

21:59.359 --> 22:00.610
Dan?

22:00.694 --> 22:01.778
Melody?

22:03.655 --> 22:04.656
Melody?

22:43.653 --> 22:45.364
Who the fuck are you, T. Bellows?

23:10.931 --> 23:12.224
Holy shit.

23:52.722 --> 23:55.350
<i> Dude, </i>Paranormal Perception
In Non-Schizophrenic Adults?

23:55.434 --> 23:58.728
Your dad was writing
for fucking parapsychology journals.

23:59.229 --> 24:01.148
Did you know
he was into supernatural shit?

24:01.231 --> 24:02.232
<i>No.</i>

24:03.024 --> 24:06.194
Well, maybe that's what got him
in trouble with the department.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.029
Which would be bullshit, if you ask me.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.407
What's the crime in keeping an open mind?

24:10.490 --> 24:11.575
<i>Yeah, maybe.</i>

24:11.658 --> 24:16.079
All right. Well, I'll see
if I can turn up anything else he wrote.

24:16.705 --> 24:17.789
What else did you find?

24:18.540 --> 24:20.876
<i>A bunch of stuff</i>
<i>from the Visser Apartments.</i>

24:21.501 --> 24:25.422
<i>Bagged and tagged clothes,</i>
<i>pictures, books.</i>

24:25.505 --> 24:27.674
<i>Water-damaged, fire-damaged.</i>

24:28.925 --> 24:30.927
Maybe it's evidence
in some kind of lawsuit.

24:32.179 --> 24:34.055
Did you find any of Melody's stuff?

24:37.559 --> 24:39.603
<i>Yeah, I found her ring.</i>

24:42.272 --> 24:43.773
<i>And I found her journal.</i>

24:53.450 --> 24:55.035
Hey, how'd you crack that code?

24:55.535 --> 24:58.288
<i>Remember that notebook</i>
<i>I found in the rec room?</i>

24:58.371 --> 25:00.123
<i>The one with all the soap opera plots?</i>

25:00.207 --> 25:03.335
I found more of them
in one of the other bedrooms.

25:03.418 --> 25:04.503
A lot more.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.631
Must've been written by someone else
who was working up here.

25:07.714 --> 25:11.384
So… what was this guy doing up there?

25:11.468 --> 25:13.178
Just fucking watching soap operas?

25:13.261 --> 25:15.305
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>But the code is in one of the books.</i>

25:15.388 --> 25:18.350
He must've been snooping
down in the basement as well.

25:18.433 --> 25:21.269
"T. Bellows." Hey, can you track him down?

25:21.353 --> 25:23.688
-See what he knows?
<i>-Yeah, I'll see what I can find.</i>

25:24.272 --> 25:25.815
Um, are you, uh…

25:27.108 --> 25:29.069
Is everything good? You doing okay?

25:29.152 --> 25:31.988
<i>I know you're hoping Melody</i>
<i>made it out alive, so…</i>

25:32.072 --> 25:33.949
<i>-If you want to talk--</i>
-I'm fine, thanks.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.784
Good luck with the show tonight.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.161
Hello?

25:39.162 --> 25:41.331
Dude, fuck you.
I'm just trying to be sensitive.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.418
Great space.

25:46.002 --> 25:47.629
You here for <i>Mystery Signals?</i>

25:47.712 --> 25:50.423
Show's not till 8:00.
You can get your tickets at the door.

25:50.507 --> 25:53.301
You can feel a real sense of history here.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.805
Lots of possibilities.

25:56.888 --> 26:00.433
Thanks. Uh, my dad owns the building,
if that's what you're asking about.

26:00.517 --> 26:01.685
It's not for sale.

26:01.768 --> 26:03.812
Everything's for sale, Mark.

26:07.315 --> 26:08.608
Virgil Davenport.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.736
Pleasure to finally meet
Dan's best friend.

26:13.738 --> 26:14.739
Okay.

26:14.823 --> 26:18.994
If you don't mind me saying,
you and Dan sure make a strange pair.

26:20.245 --> 26:23.957
I think it's terrific Dan has someone
like you to draw him out of his shell,

26:24.040 --> 26:26.751
but I can't quite see
what you get out of the relationship,

26:26.835 --> 26:28.920
big personality like yourself.

26:32.465 --> 26:34.384
Who says I need to get anything out of it?

26:35.051 --> 26:36.720
Human nature, I suppose.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.014
I have tech rehearsal in ten minutes.

26:39.097 --> 26:41.349
You found your way in,
you can find your way out.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.560
Let me come clean, Mark.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.021
I'm here because I'm worried about Dan.

26:46.104 --> 26:50.525
I was hoping we might be able to talk
about how he's handling his isolation.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.862
How the fuck would I know?

26:53.945 --> 26:56.281
Apologies, I should've said right up front

26:56.364 --> 26:57.949
I know you're in touch with him.

26:58.033 --> 27:01.911
Thought you might be able to provide
a perspective on his mental health.

27:03.371 --> 27:05.040
No idea what you're talking about.

27:05.123 --> 27:09.127
Dan spent eight weeks in a residential
treatment center in Vermont last year

27:09.210 --> 27:11.296
on your… dime.

27:11.379 --> 27:13.173
Your father's, technically.

27:14.049 --> 27:18.053
It was some kind of a breakdown,
isn't that right? Over a relationship?

27:20.764 --> 27:22.474
It wasn't about the breakup, okay?

27:22.557 --> 27:25.935
The whole thing with Jill
just triggered a bunch of old family shit.

27:26.019 --> 27:28.188
Abandonment issues.
He wasn't eating, sleeping.

27:28.271 --> 27:30.315
When I found him, he was in a bad way

27:30.398 --> 27:33.485
and he agreed to check himself in
and then get help.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.613
I'm concerned, Mark.

27:38.114 --> 27:39.282
I like Dan.

27:41.201 --> 27:45.038
If you have any indication
he's headed for another crack-up, I'd…

27:45.705 --> 27:48.166
really appreciate the opportunity to…

27:49.000 --> 27:49.918
help him out.

27:50.001 --> 27:53.129
I'd be happy to compensate you
for your assistance, of course.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.339
You want a spy.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.633
We're on the same side here.

27:56.716 --> 27:58.301
Go fuck yourself.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.222
Well, thanks for hearing me out.

28:03.848 --> 28:05.475
I'll leave you to your rehearsal.

28:14.859 --> 28:17.696
What the fuck's so important
about Melody Pendras and her tapes?

28:19.197 --> 28:23.243
A hundred thousand dollars
to restore some school project?

28:23.827 --> 28:26.538
What the fuck are you expecting to find?

28:26.621 --> 28:28.623
That information's confidential.

28:36.923 --> 28:38.174
Call anytime.

28:48.268 --> 28:51.938
<i> Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Isn't this just fucking amazing?</i>

28:53.606 --> 28:55.650
<i>I feel like I'm time-traveling.</i>

28:55.734 --> 28:59.487
<i>This paint is like</i>
<i>a portal into Eleanor's soul.</i>

29:01.156 --> 29:02.699
<i>Is that what you're wearing?</i>

29:02.782 --> 29:06.077
<i>Who's that who's starring</i>
<i>in your power nap sex-dreams these days?</i>

29:06.161 --> 29:07.787
<i>Is it Sting, or, like,</i>

29:07.871 --> 29:10.832
<i>one of those beardy grad students</i>
<i>from the anthro department?</i>

29:10.915 --> 29:13.710
<i>Your good Dr. Steven Turner?</i>

29:13.793 --> 29:15.795
They're not sex dreams.

29:15.879 --> 29:16.921
They're just…

29:18.798 --> 29:20.800
I don't know what they are. They're just…

29:21.760 --> 29:23.344
conversations.

29:25.221 --> 29:28.183
-Are you getting ready or not?
-I will meet you up there.

29:28.266 --> 29:31.478
Twenty minutes late,
like a fucking normal person.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.400
What are you doing here?

29:38.276 --> 29:40.695
Cassandra wanted
some young energy at the party.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.405
Whatever that means.

29:42.489 --> 29:45.074
-She's paying me ten dollars an hour.
-Awesome.

29:45.158 --> 29:47.118
-Oh, that looks nice on you.

29:47.744 --> 29:48.745
Oh.

29:48.828 --> 29:50.246
Cassandra let me borrow it.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.748
You brought your camera.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.334
I hope you don't mind.

29:54.417 --> 29:55.627
Oh, don't be silly.

29:55.710 --> 29:58.296
We're all performers,
whether we admit it or not.

29:59.255 --> 30:00.965
And where's your Anabelle?

30:02.467 --> 30:03.593
She'll be here.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.806
Well, shall we put on some music?

30:17.440 --> 30:19.067
Helen.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.486
-Love…
-Hi.

30:27.826 --> 30:31.496
This is Patricia. She said
she wouldn't mind being interviewed.

30:37.627 --> 30:39.420
You can just look right at me.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.258
Patricia Marston. I'm in 3B.

30:43.341 --> 30:45.635
And how long have you lived at the Visser?

30:46.219 --> 30:49.138
Long, long time. Since '62.

30:49.222 --> 30:52.308
Was my first real apartment
after secretarial school.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.937
I'm retired now.
I stay home and record things.

30:57.146 --> 30:58.106
Record?

30:58.189 --> 30:59.440
Stories, mostly.

31:01.609 --> 31:04.445
-Soaps, honey, but other things too.
-Oh.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.030
I record as much as I can.

31:06.114 --> 31:08.157
Started out with a real nice Betamax,

31:08.241 --> 31:11.452
and now I have two VHS machines,
top of the line.

31:12.453 --> 31:13.621
I feel like…

31:15.373 --> 31:17.250
…they have a message for me.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.462
Who has a message?

31:22.255 --> 31:23.506
I shouldn't say.

31:30.555 --> 31:31.389
Uh…

31:31.472 --> 31:33.474
Can I ask you about a resident?

31:35.018 --> 31:37.854
Do you remember a Julia Bennett?

31:37.937 --> 31:41.941
<i>Port Charles?</i> She had a twin, Penelope?

31:43.693 --> 31:45.653
Helen Jung, 5A.

31:46.279 --> 31:47.488
I'm a sculptor.

31:48.114 --> 31:50.158
I design masks, mostly.

31:54.203 --> 31:57.332
I've been working with Tamara.
You know Tamara?

31:58.875 --> 32:00.793
You made those masks for her ritual piece.

32:00.877 --> 32:01.794
Her opera.

32:02.670 --> 32:03.671
Yes.

32:04.547 --> 32:06.966
And you're part
of the historical society too?

32:07.550 --> 32:09.302
The one that meets in the community room?

32:14.515 --> 32:16.351
I'm gonna go mingle.

32:30.865 --> 32:33.201
Did Patricia tell you about her tapes?

32:33.993 --> 32:38.456
How many hours must that be?
I mean, ten years of her story?

32:38.539 --> 32:40.541
She's got a storage unit in Queens.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.586
Sometimes she sends me in a taxi
to drop off boxes.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.841
-I found your guest outside.
-Sorry, I forgot the code.

32:48.925 --> 32:50.093
Evie.

32:50.176 --> 32:51.386
Oh!

32:52.762 --> 32:53.638
<i>Everyone?</i>

32:54.514 --> 32:55.431
<i>This…</i>

32:56.432 --> 32:58.393
<i>is Evie Crest.</i>

32:58.476 --> 33:01.020
<i>Evie is an actress, currently starring</i>

33:01.104 --> 33:03.648
<i>-off-Broadway in </i>Three Daughters.
-Evie Crest?

33:03.731 --> 33:05.191
The hell are you doing there?

33:05.274 --> 33:08.820
<i>She recently bought two paintings</i>
<i>of my darling Eleanor's,</i>

33:09.529 --> 33:11.572
<i>and I don't think</i>
<i>they could find a better home.</i>

33:11.656 --> 33:12.824
<i>Thank you.</i>

33:12.907 --> 33:15.702
<i>Such a pleasure to be here</i>
<i>and meet you all.</i>

33:16.995 --> 33:18.413
Shall we dine?

33:22.000 --> 33:25.336
I'm using the escape pod.
Have fun with theolds.

33:26.295 --> 33:28.381
I've always been

33:29.340 --> 33:31.092
fascinated by Eleanor's work.

33:31.175 --> 33:34.887
The idea that there are
spirits all around us,

33:34.971 --> 33:38.850
speaking to us, speaking through us.

33:38.933 --> 33:41.227
I feel the very same way
when I'm on the stage.

33:41.310 --> 33:43.354
I'm a very spiritual person.

33:45.857 --> 33:49.318
Cassandra usually doesn't let men stay,
so I couldn't say no.

33:49.402 --> 33:51.821
Sorry that you have to
sit next to me all night.

33:52.447 --> 33:53.656
It's fine.

33:53.740 --> 33:57.285
You know, I don't know
how many of you know this about Evie,

33:57.368 --> 34:00.288
but her father was the late William Crest.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.457
I loved him in <i>Phantasmagoria</i>.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.917
Channel 7 used to run it
as the afternoon movie

34:05.001 --> 34:06.586
every Friday in October.

34:06.669 --> 34:08.713
Oh, I love that one too.

34:09.672 --> 34:13.301
Is it true he made a TV show
that never aired?

34:13.384 --> 34:15.011
<i>The Circle</i>, yes.

34:15.762 --> 34:20.099
I'm afraid all the footage was lost
after the accident.

34:20.683 --> 34:24.062
We hired investigators
to search for it, but no luck.

34:25.563 --> 34:29.192
I heard <i>The Circle</i>
was inspired by a snuff film.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.651
True or false?

34:31.778 --> 34:33.696
-True.
-Ah!

34:34.280 --> 34:37.825
Apparently, Daddy went
to a bachelor party.

34:37.909 --> 34:42.413
Some old occult lodge
in the Hollywood Hills. Very exclusive.

34:42.497 --> 34:45.374
There were all sorts
of skull-and-bones types in that town.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.795
Los Angeles was once the occult capital
of the world, you know.

34:50.046 --> 34:52.924
After dinner, they were blindfolded

34:53.007 --> 34:55.343
and led through the canyon
to an underground bunker,

34:55.426 --> 34:58.304
sworn to secrecy,
and then they watched the film.

34:59.055 --> 35:00.723
What was it about?

35:01.224 --> 35:03.559
Mommy's quite sure it was a hoax,

35:03.643 --> 35:07.939
but apparently
it was some kind of ritual sacrifice.

35:08.022 --> 35:09.190
Very gruesome.

35:09.857 --> 35:13.361
Either way, it inspired Daddy
to create <i>The Circle.</i>

35:13.444 --> 35:16.155
All we have are the scripts,
of course, but--

35:16.239 --> 35:19.826
I'm sure it was brilliant.
He was brilliant. Everything he did.

35:20.451 --> 35:22.745
And do you know
who the bachelor party was for?

35:22.829 --> 35:23.788
Mm…

35:24.413 --> 35:25.665
Goodness, I can't recall.

35:25.748 --> 35:28.876
-Perhaps any of the guests that attended?
-No.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.086
No, I'm afraid not.

35:30.169 --> 35:32.130
You're sure there's no copy of this film?

35:32.213 --> 35:36.008
I mean, perhaps William tracked
one down? Had a copy in his things?

35:38.678 --> 35:40.555
Not that I know of.

35:41.389 --> 35:45.518
Although, so many of his things
went missing after the accident.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.979
-We were always hoping--
-It was suicide.

35:48.479 --> 35:49.397
Wasn't it?

35:52.775 --> 35:53.943
Not an accident?

35:54.485 --> 35:55.653
Tamara.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.281
Jesus.

35:58.364 --> 35:59.323
Sorry.

36:00.324 --> 36:02.034
I shouldn't drink champagne.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.954
No, it's true.

36:05.037 --> 36:07.165
That's what they say. Suicide.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.083
I just…

36:13.296 --> 36:16.924
He would never abandon us like that,
he just wouldn't. He loved us.

36:17.008 --> 36:20.469
Oh, no, no, no, of course not.

36:20.553 --> 36:21.512
Aw.

36:21.596 --> 36:22.930
No.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.640
There may be a way

36:25.641 --> 36:28.603
for you to speak with him again
from beyond.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.271
-What do you mean?
-Well…

36:31.314 --> 36:33.774
Beatriz here is a very talented medium.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.861
She's helped me speak
with my Eleanor many times.

36:36.944 --> 36:38.738
It is such a comfort.

36:38.821 --> 36:41.532
Maybe, if you'd like to try,

36:41.616 --> 36:43.951
and if Beatriz is willing…?

36:44.577 --> 36:48.664
It would be my pleasure
to try, and, um, make a connection.

36:49.457 --> 36:50.583
A séance?

36:54.420 --> 36:55.296
Yes.

36:55.838 --> 36:58.591
-Yes. Please.
-Well, let's make room.

37:09.644 --> 37:11.520
I have lots of candles.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.231
Here.

37:15.441 --> 37:16.859
So, you make this a habit?

37:19.862 --> 37:21.072
No, I just…

37:22.281 --> 37:25.451
Cassandra said
she was gonna open it for me, so I…

37:35.044 --> 37:35.962
Hmm.

37:50.935 --> 37:52.603
It's a self-portrait.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.356
It's wonderful.

37:56.357 --> 37:58.442
Grab those tuning forks.

38:22.216 --> 38:24.635
Move among us, spirits.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.387
All are welcome.

38:27.722 --> 38:30.099
Let the dead be with us.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.894
All seeking passage.

38:36.856 --> 38:38.149
William Crest.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.651
We call you now.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.278
Evie is waiting.

38:45.114 --> 38:46.699
William Crest.

38:46.782 --> 38:48.617
We call you now.

38:48.701 --> 38:50.536
Evie is waiting.

38:50.619 --> 38:53.622
Evie is waiting.

39:07.678 --> 39:08.721
Mm.

39:15.811 --> 39:17.271
Ask him something.

39:17.355 --> 39:18.606
Go ahead.

39:20.524 --> 39:21.442
Daddy?

39:27.073 --> 39:28.115
Daddy?

39:29.075 --> 39:30.242
Are you there?

39:38.292 --> 39:42.213
You have to ask something
only he would know.

39:50.596 --> 39:53.599
Do you remember my sixth birthday?

39:54.183 --> 39:57.520
It was snowing,
and no one came to my party.

39:59.021 --> 40:00.147
You gave me a book.

40:06.612 --> 40:09.573
"I am nobody."

40:12.243 --> 40:13.494
"Who are you?"

40:14.245 --> 40:16.330
"Are you nobody too?"

40:17.748 --> 40:20.418
"Then there's a pair of us."

40:20.918 --> 40:21.961
Shh.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.422
Shh…

40:24.505 --> 40:26.090
"Don't tell."

40:26.924 --> 40:29.427
"They'd advertise, you know."

40:29.969 --> 40:31.929
Emily Dickinson.

40:33.347 --> 40:34.849
Yes. Oh, my God.

40:37.184 --> 40:38.602
Ask him about the film.

40:41.647 --> 40:42.940
What?

40:43.023 --> 40:46.193
The film. The snuff film.

40:50.990 --> 40:51.907
Daddy.

40:52.992 --> 40:55.035
Do you remember the film?

40:56.662 --> 40:58.205
That terrible film?

40:59.081 --> 41:00.374
From the party?

41:00.458 --> 41:03.002
Do you remember whose party it was?

41:05.713 --> 41:06.964
Crawford.

41:08.257 --> 41:09.467
Uncle Peter?

41:10.718 --> 41:14.555
Peter Crawford. My godfather. Uh…

41:14.638 --> 41:16.265
I never would've guessed.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.226
Ask him if he ever found a copy.

41:22.271 --> 41:23.481
Ask him.

41:27.401 --> 41:30.446
Did you ever find a copy of it? The film?

41:31.197 --> 41:32.239
Mm.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.126
Stay away.

41:46.504 --> 41:50.925
Stay away. Stay away!

41:52.259 --> 41:55.012
Stay away.

41:56.722 --> 42:00.518
Stay away. Stay away.

42:00.601 --> 42:02.061
Stay away from--

42:13.364 --> 42:14.823
I'm sorry.

42:17.743 --> 42:18.786
I've lost him.

42:18.869 --> 42:20.204
Maybe try again.

42:20.287 --> 42:21.288
No.

42:24.166 --> 42:25.543
It's okay. It's okay.

42:26.502 --> 42:28.128
Everything's all right.

42:32.174 --> 42:33.759
What about you, Melody?

42:36.053 --> 42:37.054
What?

42:37.137 --> 42:39.390
Is there someone you'd like to contact?

42:41.392 --> 42:42.434
No.

42:42.518 --> 42:43.686
Your mother?

42:45.312 --> 42:46.313
No.

42:48.315 --> 42:49.650
She's not dead.

42:51.068 --> 42:52.945
You don't know that for sure.

43:09.587 --> 43:10.838
Julia Bennett.

43:12.214 --> 43:13.507
This ring was hers.

43:44.788 --> 43:46.290
Julia Bennett.

43:48.917 --> 43:51.295
We call for you now.

43:51.879 --> 43:53.380
Melody is waiting.

43:54.757 --> 43:56.050
Julia Bennett?

43:57.551 --> 43:59.178
We call you now.

44:00.554 --> 44:02.264
Melody is waiting.

44:02.848 --> 44:05.351
Your daughter is waiting.

44:28.248 --> 44:29.124
I'm sorry.

44:30.209 --> 44:34.296
I'm afraid I don't sense her presence
in the realm of the dead.

44:40.052 --> 44:41.220
Wait.

44:41.804 --> 44:43.514
Someone else…

44:50.729 --> 44:51.939
Who is that?

44:57.486 --> 44:59.154
What are you watching?

44:59.238 --> 45:03.158
Nothing. It's just some footage
I'm working on.

45:03.826 --> 45:05.160
Are you a filmmaker?

45:06.453 --> 45:07.371
No.

45:08.706 --> 45:09.832
No, I'm…

45:10.999 --> 45:12.668
I'm… I'm restoring it.

45:13.460 --> 45:14.753
That's what I do.

45:16.213 --> 45:18.924
Films, tapes, photographs.

45:19.883 --> 45:23.387
Things that have been damaged,
lost, or forgotten.

45:24.596 --> 45:26.014
I bring them back.

45:30.144 --> 45:31.228
I know her.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.358
Or I knew her. I…

45:39.820 --> 45:41.905
I just can't remember her name.

45:43.907 --> 45:45.409
Do you remember my name?

45:46.243 --> 45:47.244
Dan.

45:48.245 --> 45:49.371
Your name is Dan.

45:49.913 --> 45:52.750
-You live at the Visser.
-No, I don't.

45:53.667 --> 45:56.754
I've never been to the Visser.

45:56.837 --> 45:58.839
We met in the community room.

45:58.922 --> 46:00.758
That's impossible. I live here.

46:02.426 --> 46:04.094
Then where did we meet?

46:04.178 --> 46:05.471
I'm not sure.

46:10.476 --> 46:12.269
I'm supposed to ask you something.

46:13.979 --> 46:14.980
What?

46:20.486 --> 46:22.821
I'm supposed to ask you for help.

46:22.905 --> 46:24.907
Okay, what… what kind of help?

46:26.867 --> 46:27.951
I don't know.

46:29.036 --> 46:31.580
Everything's all jumbled up in my head.

46:31.663 --> 46:32.706
It's okay.

46:33.373 --> 46:34.875
It's okay. Everything's okay.

46:34.958 --> 46:37.461
I want to help. Just tell me how.

46:43.592 --> 46:44.885
What is that?

46:52.476 --> 46:53.936
You took my notebook?

46:57.856 --> 46:59.233
What did you do to it?

46:59.316 --> 47:00.526
Nothing.

47:00.609 --> 47:02.110
I found it like that.

47:08.367 --> 47:09.910
You stole my ring?

47:11.161 --> 47:13.330
Why? I… I don't understand.

47:13.956 --> 47:16.208
How do you have my things?
Where did you get them?

47:16.291 --> 47:18.168
What the fuck is going on here?

47:21.255 --> 47:22.464
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

47:23.048 --> 47:24.383
They're just…

47:26.009 --> 47:27.302
lost.

47:27.386 --> 47:29.638
And don't know where to go.

47:35.394 --> 47:36.728
You're dead, Melody.

47:38.355 --> 47:39.356
What?

47:41.275 --> 47:43.485
You died in a fire at the Visser.

47:44.361 --> 47:46.405
Twenty-five years ago. I'm sorry.

47:49.783 --> 47:51.493
Are you crazy?

47:53.620 --> 47:56.456
That footage I'm working on

47:58.000 --> 47:59.251
is your footage.

48:04.756 --> 48:07.551
Tapes that you made
while you were living there.

48:07.634 --> 48:09.845
I'm just trying to understand
what happened to you.

48:09.928 --> 48:12.848
No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no.

48:12.931 --> 48:14.600
How you knew my father.

48:15.309 --> 48:16.935
What caused the fire.

48:17.936 --> 48:19.354
If you ever found your mother.

48:19.438 --> 48:21.064
What the fuck is wrong with you?

48:21.148 --> 48:22.941
I'm trying to help.

48:23.025 --> 48:24.192
Like you asked.

48:26.528 --> 48:28.614
You're lost. You don't know where to go.

48:28.697 --> 48:30.365
I'm not fucking dead!

48:39.541 --> 48:41.209
<i>Someone else…</i>

49:05.442 --> 49:07.277
"I can get out of your way."

49:09.738 --> 49:10.656
"Me too."

49:11.323 --> 49:12.491
"I'm new."

49:13.200 --> 49:17.663
"I know you're a good person
and that you care about people."

49:17.746 --> 49:20.499
"You try to make them feel safe."

49:20.582 --> 49:22.334
"It's a feature, not a bug."

49:22.876 --> 49:26.171
<i>"I really needed to hear that.</i>
<i>So, thank you."</i>

49:26.797 --> 49:28.173
<i>"You're welcome."</i>

49:29.216 --> 49:32.177
"I don't understand
what's happening here."

49:32.803 --> 49:36.014
"This conversation,
is it really happening?"

49:36.098 --> 49:37.432
What are you doing?

49:37.516 --> 49:39.184
"Why wouldn't it be happening?"

49:39.267 --> 49:42.437
What are you doing? Where did
you hear that? How do you know that?

49:42.521 --> 49:44.231
"I'm supposed to ask you for help."

49:45.065 --> 49:46.483
<i>"What kind of help?"</i>

49:46.566 --> 49:47.818
<i>"I don't know."</i>

49:47.901 --> 49:50.612
<i>"Everything is jumbled up in my head."</i>

49:50.696 --> 49:52.864
<i>-"You took my notebook."</i>
What the fuck?

49:52.948 --> 49:56.243
"What the fuck is going on here?"

50:00.497 --> 50:01.957
"You're dead."

50:02.749 --> 50:04.167
You can't know that.

50:04.251 --> 50:08.296
You can't know what's in my dreams,
you can't know what's in my head.

50:13.135 --> 50:14.177
It's real.

50:16.680 --> 50:17.723
It is real.

50:21.727 --> 50:23.186
<i>"You died in a fire."</i>

50:23.270 --> 50:25.605
<i>-"At the Visser. Twenty-five years ago."</i>

50:25.689 --> 50:26.773
<i>"I'm sorry."</i>

50:27.858 --> 50:28.859
<i>"Are you crazy?"</i>

50:28.942 --> 50:30.986
Okay, I can save her. I can save her.

50:31.069 --> 50:32.237
There's still time.

50:32.320 --> 50:34.614
-She doesn't have to die.
-<i>Okay, slow down.</i>

50:36.450 --> 50:40.579
The conversations were real, Mark.
I wasn't dreaming. They're real.

50:41.538 --> 50:43.999
-What the fuck are you talking about?
<i>-Melody.</i>

50:44.082 --> 50:47.127
I've been seeing her here.
At first I thought I was dreaming.

50:47.210 --> 50:49.880
<i>I thought I was going crazy,</i>
<i>thought she was haunting me.</i>

50:49.963 --> 50:51.840
But they were real,
the conversations were real.

50:51.923 --> 50:53.008
-We were talking.
<i>-Dan.</i>

50:53.091 --> 50:55.969
<i>I can warn her. I can warn her</i>
<i>to stay away from the building,</i>

50:56.053 --> 50:57.179
<i>stay away from the fire.</i>

50:57.262 --> 50:59.681
<i>There's still time.</i>
<i>There's still time. I can save her.</i>

51:01.183 --> 51:02.976
<i>She doesn't have to die.</i>

51:03.060 --> 51:06.313
<i>"It's your footage. I'm trying</i>
<i>to understand what happened to you."</i>

51:06.396 --> 51:08.023
<i>Stop it. Stop, please.</i>

51:08.106 --> 51:10.025
"How you knew my father."

51:10.108 --> 51:11.651
"What caused the fire."

51:12.235 --> 51:14.863
-"If you ever found your mother."
-What the fuck is wrong with you?

51:14.946 --> 51:17.991
All right, Beatriz,
I think that's enough for one evening.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.827
"I'm trying to help. Like you asked."

51:20.911 --> 51:22.204
"You're lost."

51:22.788 --> 51:24.331
"You don't know where to…

51:25.123 --> 51:26.249
to go."

51:27.167 --> 51:29.086
Go.

51:32.214 --> 51:36.176
Go.

51:40.680 --> 51:44.101
No!

51:44.184 --> 51:48.188
No!

51:48.271 --> 51:49.356
Holy shit.

51:49.439 --> 51:52.067
Stop!

51:52.150 --> 51:57.155
No!

51:57.739 --> 52:00.826
No!

52:01.451 --> 52:03.370
Somebody call a fucking ambulance!

52:03.453 --> 52:04.579
No!

52:04.663 --> 52:06.873
-Call a fucking ambulance!

52:10.502 --> 52:11.670
Beatriz!

52:11.753 --> 52:13.046
What did you see?

52:13.130 --> 52:14.339
What did you hear?

52:14.422 --> 52:16.216
How did you know what was in my dreams?

52:16.299 --> 52:18.176
How is that possible?

52:18.260 --> 52:20.804
-How's that possible? Please!
-Ma'am, please step back.

52:20.887 --> 52:21.721
Tell me! Hey!

52:21.805 --> 52:22.848
-Ma'am.
-Please!

52:22.931 --> 52:24.015
Beatriz!

52:24.099 --> 52:26.852
-I need to talk to her! Let me--
-Stay back, lady.

52:26.935 --> 52:27.811
Fuck.

52:27.894 --> 52:28.770
No.

52:29.354 --> 52:30.272
Wait.

52:42.993 --> 52:43.952
Anabelle.

52:44.035 --> 52:45.745
Where the fuck were you all night?

52:52.460 --> 52:53.670
What are you doing?

53:05.140 --> 53:07.058
Anabelle, what the hell is this?

53:11.646 --> 53:13.440
There's someone in there, Mel.

53:14.900 --> 53:16.776
There is someone <i>in</i> there.
