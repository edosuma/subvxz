01:24.261 --> 01:25.653
What do you see?

01:26.915 --> 01:28.003
Bag.

01:35.098 --> 01:37.578
Geophone.

01:58.077 --> 01:59.992
I don't hear anything.

02:00.035 --> 02:03.169
It's seven days, Berton.
They're dead.

02:03.213 --> 02:04.886
Get the water and the lights
ready. We're going in.

02:04.910 --> 02:07.478
One noise, and the Germans
will blow the secondary charges.

02:07.521 --> 02:09.262
It's a trap.

02:09.306 --> 02:11.090
If there's a chance, we go.

02:11.134 --> 02:13.397
You know that.

02:15.225 --> 02:17.705
Let's get this over with.
Come on.

02:23.842 --> 02:27.150
Go back to the auxiliary tunnel.
Wait for me there.

02:27.193 --> 02:28.194
Get out of here.

03:29.429 --> 03:31.170
Oh, fuck.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.231
Aaah!

03:48.274 --> 03:50.798
Shh.
The Germans are right above us.

03:52.409 --> 03:53.932
Shh.

03:57.109 --> 03:59.807
If they hear us,
they'll blow the charges.

05:09.094 --> 05:11.401
Oh. Where in God's name is he?

05:12.402 --> 05:15.187
Bloody war will be over
by the time he gets here.

05:19.017 --> 05:21.062
As you were.

05:22.760 --> 05:25.719
Give General Mackenzie
my apologies.

05:25.763 --> 05:28.287
When I'm done with our friends
from intelligence here,

05:28.331 --> 05:30.071
I'll be along immediately.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.596
Gentlemen.

05:38.428 --> 05:41.518
This is the front
as it stood two days ago.

05:41.561 --> 05:43.128
In May of last year,

05:43.171 --> 05:46.653
the Germans began constructing
an underground bunker here,

05:46.697 --> 05:48.481
deep within the Argonne Forest,

05:48.525 --> 05:51.223
almost 11 miles
behind their lines.

05:51.266 --> 05:53.747
These spoil heaps indicate

05:53.791 --> 05:56.576
that they've dug
three to four levels.

05:56.620 --> 05:58.839
They've gone as deep
as a hundred feet, sir.

05:58.883 --> 06:00.319
That doesn't make any sense.

06:00.363 --> 06:03.061
The Germans go underground
to hide from our shells

06:03.104 --> 06:06.238
or to drive tunnels beneath
our lines to plant explosives.

06:06.281 --> 06:08.303
And they wouldn't need to do
either so far from the front,

06:08.327 --> 06:09.502
would they, sir?

06:09.546 --> 06:11.504
So, what the devil
are they doing there?

06:11.548 --> 06:13.376
We don't know, but...

06:14.725 --> 06:18.119
our sources
place Reiner at the compound

06:18.163 --> 06:20.644
within the last 48 hours.

06:20.687 --> 06:23.386
Reiner, that little bastard.

06:23.429 --> 06:26.563
What do they call him,
the Prophet?

06:26.606 --> 06:29.130
What do you make of this,
Doctor?

06:30.349 --> 06:32.438
Reiner is a menace, sir.

06:32.482 --> 06:35.049
The man has been instrumental
in weaponizing chemicals...

06:35.093 --> 06:37.312
Phosgene, mustard gas.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.445
We believe he's also attempted
to weaponize anthrax,

06:39.489 --> 06:42.666
cholera, and the bubonic plague.

06:42.709 --> 06:46.452
Beneath Trench 11 could be
the Wotan complex,

06:46.496 --> 06:49.281
rumored to be
Reiner's base of operations.

06:49.324 --> 06:52.284
If he has been
developing something in there,

06:52.327 --> 06:54.199
we must go in and find out what.

06:54.242 --> 06:57.028
Surely any evidence would have
been removed during the retreat.

06:57.071 --> 06:58.203
No, sir.

06:58.246 --> 07:00.640
When the German line fell
two days ago,

07:00.684 --> 07:03.295
they did try to destroy
the base, but they failed.

07:03.338 --> 07:05.210
They left with just
the clothes on their backs.

07:05.253 --> 07:08.518
Whatever they were working on
is still there.

07:10.215 --> 07:12.043
What will you need?

07:12.086 --> 07:13.499
An escort
to get us through the Argonne.

07:13.523 --> 07:15.525
It will have to be American,
I'm afraid.

07:15.568 --> 07:19.442
Well, Colonel, surely something
can be arranged.

07:19.485 --> 07:22.314
I mean, the Americans?

07:22.357 --> 07:25.360
The Argonne belongs to them now,
and they paid dearly for it.

07:25.404 --> 07:26.536
Colonel...

07:26.579 --> 07:29.364
We are about to end this war,
Jennings.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.366
Every other soldier
within 200 miles

07:31.410 --> 07:34.979
is now gathering near Cambrai
for the final offensive.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.198
Anything else, gentlemen?

07:37.242 --> 07:39.331
A tunneler to get us down below.

07:39.374 --> 07:40.593
Given our timeline,

07:40.637 --> 07:42.377
I took the liberty
of checking with brigade.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.770
Name's Berton.

07:44.728 --> 07:46.164
Canadian.

07:46.207 --> 07:48.253
What's the medal for?

07:48.296 --> 07:51.909
He tried to save some tunnelers
in the salient in July.

07:51.952 --> 07:53.476
Miracle he survived.

07:53.519 --> 07:57.044
12 days underground?

07:57.088 --> 07:58.785
My God.

08:00.395 --> 08:02.373
It says here he's on furlough.
How will you find him?

08:02.397 --> 08:06.401
Well, he's a tunneler on his
first leave in over a year.

08:06.445 --> 08:09.317
We've a fairly good idea
where to look.

08:34.168 --> 08:35.779
Veronique.

08:39.783 --> 08:40.827
Oui.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.099
Oui, oui. J'arrive.

08:59.759 --> 09:01.108
Everything okay?

09:06.418 --> 09:08.725
I wish you didn't drink as much.

09:10.335 --> 09:12.642
Is that you
or your father talking?

09:12.685 --> 09:16.559
Well, your drinking is
the one thing he can relate to.

09:16.602 --> 09:19.779
Well, I guess he would.
He owns a tavern, after all.

09:19.823 --> 09:22.565
He's been drinking a lot more
since I've met you.

09:22.608 --> 09:23.653
Why is that?

09:25.959 --> 09:30.050
Maybe because he doesn't like
that a foreigner from far away

09:30.094 --> 09:32.139
has seduced his daughter.

09:33.532 --> 09:37.971
I-I didn't seduce you.
You seduced me.

09:39.059 --> 09:40.844
Uh-huh. I was drunk.

09:40.887 --> 09:44.630
And... And I put
my arms around you, and...

09:44.674 --> 09:47.807
Yes.
You put your arms around me.

09:47.851 --> 09:50.854
Yeah, I put my arms around you,
and then you kissed me.

09:57.077 --> 09:58.688
Just like that.

10:06.217 --> 10:08.611
Oh, I can't wait for you
to meet my parents.

10:10.047 --> 10:11.657
Your parents?

10:11.701 --> 10:13.659
And you're gonna love Winnipeg.

10:13.703 --> 10:15.269
Why?

10:15.313 --> 10:16.967
Ohh.

10:17.010 --> 10:19.883
It's even more romantic
than Paris.

10:21.232 --> 10:23.756
I can't wait for this war
to be over.

11:51.104 --> 11:55.369
That's the Argonne.
You ever been?

11:55.413 --> 11:57.589
Hell of a place for a picnic.

11:58.851 --> 12:00.374
I suggest we wait here.

12:00.418 --> 12:01.961
Wait till this blows over,
then head in.

12:01.985 --> 12:04.901
Negative. We need to push on.

12:04.944 --> 12:06.772
With all due respect, sir,
we're six men.

12:06.816 --> 12:08.339
We drove
most of them bastards out,

12:08.382 --> 12:10.341
but God knows how many
are still hiding in there,

12:10.384 --> 12:11.821
waiting to cut us down.

12:11.864 --> 12:14.519
In this weather, we don't know
what we're walking into.

12:17.478 --> 12:20.264
We wait here and observe.

12:20.307 --> 12:23.397
In one hour, we move.

12:23.441 --> 12:24.834
Understood?

12:29.360 --> 12:31.449
Fucking limeys.

12:31.492 --> 12:33.799
Just my luck, I get
the one war in a hundred years

12:33.843 --> 12:35.342
where those pricks
are on our fucking side.

12:35.366 --> 12:37.170
- Yeah.
- What's the word on them?

12:37.194 --> 12:39.239
Nothing good.

12:39.283 --> 12:41.546
I heard the major
is real ambitious.

12:41.589 --> 12:42.808
Oh, fuck. That's just perfect.

12:42.852 --> 12:44.462
Spent most of the war
riding a desk.

12:44.505 --> 12:45.961
Now he'll do anything
to get a promotion

12:45.985 --> 12:47.770
before the show's over.

12:52.949 --> 12:58.389
Well, what's your professional
opinion of our American escort?

12:58.432 --> 13:02.001
They've been in constant
combat for months on end.

13:02.045 --> 13:05.048
That starts to take its toll.

13:05.091 --> 13:09.879
My advice, sir, would be
not to push them too hard.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.839
Hit me, Pronger.

13:13.883 --> 13:16.842
Fuck off, Private. Get your own.

13:16.886 --> 13:19.540
No wonder they've been fighting
over the same fields

13:19.584 --> 13:20.933
for four years.

13:20.977 --> 13:23.544
They're all drunk.
This guy has been at it all day.

13:23.588 --> 13:25.808
He's killed more Germans
than any of us.

13:25.851 --> 13:27.374
More than Pronger?

13:27.418 --> 13:29.222
Okay, nobody's killed more
fucking Germans than Pronger.

13:29.246 --> 13:31.509
Okay, so then who the fuck
is this guy?

13:31.552 --> 13:32.684
A tunneler.

13:32.727 --> 13:34.183
Fuck, I wouldn't mind
being underground

13:34.207 --> 13:35.402
when the war is going on above.

13:35.426 --> 13:36.906
No fucking way.

13:36.949 --> 13:38.255
When the lines formed,

13:38.298 --> 13:40.170
Germans started digging
beneath no-man's-land.

13:40.213 --> 13:43.260
Guys like him
are sent underground

13:43.303 --> 13:44.739
to stop the German tunnelers

13:44.783 --> 13:47.177
and to plant bombs of their own
under Fritz's line.

13:47.220 --> 13:51.398
Three months ago,
he gets trapped 80 feet down.

13:51.442 --> 13:55.489
Nobody comes for him.
So, what does he do?

13:55.533 --> 13:58.405
That crazy bastard
digs himself out.

13:58.449 --> 13:59.842
By the time he finally gets out,

13:59.885 --> 14:02.018
his family has already
thrown his funeral.

15:05.559 --> 15:07.910
Yes, that's it, all right.

15:07.953 --> 15:09.563
Any movement?

15:09.607 --> 15:11.304
Nothing but the rats.

15:12.740 --> 15:14.917
You ever eat rat, Major?

15:16.005 --> 15:17.876
Move in and take a look.

15:19.008 --> 15:23.186
You heard the major.
Pronger, we're up.

15:32.108 --> 15:34.371
What is it they keep chewing?

15:34.414 --> 15:35.763
Seems they live on it.

15:36.721 --> 15:38.810
Forced March, sir.

15:38.853 --> 15:41.291
Cocaine. A stimulant.

15:41.334 --> 15:44.990
Seems they hand it out
with rations these days.

15:45.034 --> 15:47.601
Apparently rather effective.

15:47.645 --> 15:50.300
Let's go. Let's go.

20:07.209 --> 20:08.993
I don't think
we pushed this far.

20:09.036 --> 20:13.040
We didn't.
These are German shells.

20:13.084 --> 20:15.565
Why are they killing
their own guys?

20:16.392 --> 20:19.133
There's something you need
to see, Major.

20:36.063 --> 20:39.284
Two main entrances
were blown in,

20:39.328 --> 20:42.069
but for some reason
this one was spared.

20:47.205 --> 20:50.513
And, uh, here...

20:52.558 --> 20:55.213
as you can see,
there used to be a ladder.

20:56.127 --> 21:01.001
Whoever got rid of it
did it in a hurry.

21:01.045 --> 21:03.526
You care to tell us
what we're here for?

21:05.049 --> 21:07.138
This is
a reconnaissance mission.

21:07.181 --> 21:10.097
Observe and report.

21:26.679 --> 21:29.334
This base is abandoned, so we
don't expect any resistance.

21:29.378 --> 21:32.163
What a shame.

21:32.206 --> 21:33.599
Once we're in, the doctor and I

21:33.643 --> 21:35.645
will collect
any relevant evidence,

21:35.688 --> 21:37.081
and we'll be on our way.

21:37.124 --> 21:39.257
- Simple enough.
- How do we know it's abandoned?

21:39.301 --> 21:41.825
I heard entire divisions got
left behind when the line fell.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.087
Shut it, Kelly.

21:43.130 --> 21:44.456
We don't got the numbers
for a raiding party.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.066
If we run into more than
a couple of these guys,

21:46.090 --> 21:47.265
we're in some serious trou...

21:47.309 --> 21:50.094
This mission was approved
by my superiors.

21:50.137 --> 21:53.053
Risks were assessed
and appropriate measures taken.

21:53.097 --> 21:54.272
We are wasting valuable time.

21:54.316 --> 21:55.795
Captain Cooper.

21:55.839 --> 21:57.188
Yes, sir?

21:57.231 --> 21:59.059
Control your men.

22:00.670 --> 22:02.236
Or I will.

22:03.760 --> 22:06.632
- All right, the tunneler...
- Berton, sir.

22:07.764 --> 22:09.940
Will take the lead.

22:09.983 --> 22:12.421
Sausage eater
is a tricky bastard, all right?

22:12.464 --> 22:14.423
When he pulls out of
places like this,

22:14.466 --> 22:15.815
he likes to leave
little presents

22:15.859 --> 22:18.427
for stupid farm boys
looking for trophies.

22:18.470 --> 22:21.038
So for all our sakes,
don't touch anything

22:21.081 --> 22:23.954
unless I fucking say so.

22:23.997 --> 22:26.739
All right, Berton. Let's go.

24:16.066 --> 24:19.417
Let's move. Cooper, you're up.

25:34.318 --> 25:36.755
I smell the bastard
from six feet...

25:36.799 --> 25:38.148
Quiet!

25:38.191 --> 25:40.454
Sneak up on me.
Smelled like sauerkraut.

25:42.326 --> 25:44.197
Berton, check the door.

26:03.086 --> 26:04.914
- Oh!
- Watch your step, Doc.

26:04.957 --> 26:06.568
Hey, shut up!

26:12.225 --> 26:13.662
He's fucking dead.

26:13.705 --> 26:16.447
Shh! Quiet, for God sakes.

26:34.857 --> 26:36.554
It's all quiet.
We're good to go.

26:36.598 --> 26:38.121
Sir.

26:39.818 --> 26:41.907
I think he tried to climb out.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.582
Do you guys speak German?

27:04.626 --> 27:06.453
He's saying,
"Don't open the door."

27:10.849 --> 27:12.459
Okay, what the fuck
is he saying now?

27:12.503 --> 27:13.852
Spit it out, Doc.

27:13.896 --> 27:15.985
He says if we open the door,
we're all gonna die.

27:18.161 --> 27:20.380
Did I tell you to stop?

27:21.294 --> 27:22.774
Come on!

27:23.949 --> 27:25.995
- Nein, nein, nein!
- Shut that idiot up, Captain.

27:26.038 --> 27:28.258
What do you want me to do,
shoot him? He's fucking C3.

27:28.301 --> 27:30.782
Find out if he's got
friends down here.

27:35.744 --> 27:37.069
Maybe we should
listen to him, sir.

27:37.093 --> 27:38.287
We don't know
what's behind that.

27:38.311 --> 27:39.878
Shut up! Come on!

27:42.141 --> 27:43.621
Hey!

27:43.665 --> 27:45.928
Doc, you tell this asshole
if he takes another step,

27:45.971 --> 27:46.842
I will shoot.

27:46.885 --> 27:48.670
Shoot? Shoot, ja. Ja!

27:48.713 --> 27:50.672
- Hey, hey!
- Shoot, ja! Ja! Bitte!

27:50.715 --> 27:51.803
- Shoot, shoot.
- Hey!

27:51.847 --> 27:52.867
Come on. On three.

27:52.891 --> 27:54.066
One, two, three!

27:54.110 --> 27:55.981
You understand what I'm saying?

27:56.025 --> 27:57.200
- Bitte! Bitte!
- Doc?

27:57.243 --> 27:58.505
- Shooting me.
- I swear to God.

27:58.549 --> 28:00.116
He keeps moving, I will shoot.

28:00.159 --> 28:01.479
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

28:01.508 --> 28:02.703
- I'm ordering you to get back!
- Bitte.

28:02.727 --> 28:03.728
Hey, Captain...

28:58.478 --> 29:01.743
All right, Berton.
You take the lead.

30:11.116 --> 30:12.814
There's someone in here.

30:22.171 --> 30:24.738
Hold your fire!

30:24.782 --> 30:26.479
Hold your fire.

30:26.523 --> 30:28.525
I can't fucking see anything!

30:28.568 --> 30:30.309
Where is he? Where did he go?

30:39.710 --> 30:41.668
Aah!

30:42.321 --> 30:45.107
Aaagh!

30:49.938 --> 30:51.853
Grenade!

30:51.896 --> 30:53.419
Grenade!

30:53.463 --> 30:54.943
Take cover!

31:02.646 --> 31:03.821
Everybody okay?

31:03.865 --> 31:06.519
- Yeah.
- You okay, Kelly?

31:06.563 --> 31:07.999
Yeah, I'm fine, Captain.

31:13.657 --> 31:17.313
Abandoned, my ass.
Who the fuck was that?

31:25.538 --> 31:26.713
Can it be cleared?

31:26.757 --> 31:28.541
My guess is
the entire tunnel collapsed.

31:28.585 --> 31:29.629
Can it be cleared?

31:29.673 --> 31:30.955
Best we search
for another way out.

31:30.979 --> 31:32.347
Are you saying
we're stuck down here?

31:32.371 --> 31:33.871
This room's
not gonna hold much longer.

31:33.895 --> 31:35.481
- We need to move.
- How are we gonna breathe?

31:35.505 --> 31:36.830
- We're 50 feet deep.
- Shut up, Kelly.

31:36.854 --> 31:37.918
We're gonna fucking suffocate.

31:37.942 --> 31:40.771
Shut up! Save your breath.

31:40.814 --> 31:42.686
Let's go.

32:01.009 --> 32:03.533
We ain't alone down here.

32:03.576 --> 32:05.970
Look sharp.

32:06.014 --> 32:08.407
Watch the corners.

32:32.736 --> 32:35.304
The air is moving.

32:35.347 --> 32:38.481
Fritz left
a door open somewhere.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.352
Yes? And?

32:41.701 --> 32:43.399
We go down.

33:08.424 --> 33:10.992
Sit tight while I scout ahead.

33:17.259 --> 33:19.957
That German back there,
was that shell shock?

33:20.001 --> 33:21.611
Shell shock?

33:21.654 --> 33:24.048
You've really never been on
a battlefield, have you, Major?

33:24.092 --> 33:26.964
That Hun was sick.
He ain't the first one, either.

33:27.008 --> 33:28.724
We've been finding them
all through the Argonne.

33:28.748 --> 33:32.143
There have been reports that the
German line was recently struck

33:32.187 --> 33:34.972
by a particularly lethal form
of influenza.

33:35.016 --> 33:36.191
Is that why we're here?

33:36.234 --> 33:38.367
Maybe that's why
they sealed the base.

33:39.324 --> 33:41.109
That guy just
hacked all over me.

33:41.152 --> 33:43.763
This place is a maze.
Best you just come with me.

33:43.807 --> 33:45.287
No.

33:45.330 --> 33:47.134
Captain Cooper will escort you.
Help him find an exit.

33:47.158 --> 33:49.682
The rest of us will continue
our sweep and meet back here.

33:49.726 --> 33:51.399
Sweep? We've got no idea
how big this place is.

33:51.423 --> 33:53.686
You go sightseeing,
you'll get lost.

33:53.730 --> 33:55.360
No, he's right. How are we gonna
get back without him?

33:55.384 --> 33:56.994
We'll lay markers.

33:57.038 --> 34:01.085
Okay, sir, with all respect,
six men are stronger than four.

34:01.129 --> 34:02.434
You are under my direct command.

34:02.478 --> 34:03.878
I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you.

34:03.914 --> 34:06.177
Captain, this is bullshit.

34:06.221 --> 34:07.613
Not my call.

34:07.657 --> 34:09.025
Without that tunneler, sir,
we're dead.

34:09.050 --> 34:10.485
Like the major said,

34:10.529 --> 34:11.878
lay markers,
trace your way back.

34:11.922 --> 34:13.141
Yeah, this is crazy, though.

34:13.184 --> 34:15.012
Hey! I'll come back for you.

34:15.056 --> 34:16.337
Yeah, and I'm not
dying down here, sir.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.407
Gentlemen!

34:18.449 --> 34:20.452
I understand your concerns,

34:20.496 --> 34:23.107
but we have prepared
for this contingency.

34:23.150 --> 34:26.371
As we speak, a team of
Royal Engineers is en route

34:26.415 --> 34:27.981
and will check in on us.

34:28.025 --> 34:30.462
If our tunneler
can't find an exit,

34:30.505 --> 34:33.726
and if we fail to check in
by 0900 tomorrow,

34:33.770 --> 34:36.120
efforts to extract us
will begin.

34:36.164 --> 34:37.730
Now, in the meantime...

34:38.688 --> 34:41.603
we are here to complete
a vitally important mission,

34:41.647 --> 34:43.475
and, by God, I intend
to see that it's done.

34:43.518 --> 34:45.216
Lieutenant Berton,
find that exit

34:45.260 --> 34:47.304
and be back here in three hours.

34:47.349 --> 34:49.132
Yeah. You got three hours.

34:49.177 --> 34:51.483
Three hours to find whatever
it is you came down here for,

34:51.527 --> 34:53.746
but don't expect me to find you
if you're not back.

34:54.833 --> 34:57.098
I expect that you
and every other man in this unit

34:57.141 --> 34:58.229
will do his duty.

34:58.273 --> 34:59.883
Do I make myself clear?

35:04.975 --> 35:06.281
Good luck.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.937
It's a bad idea, Captain.

35:24.473 --> 35:26.170
What kind of place is this?

35:26.214 --> 35:28.216
Some kind of command center?

35:28.259 --> 35:30.522
12 miles behind enemy lines?

35:30.566 --> 35:33.003
What about that metal door
we found?

35:33.046 --> 35:36.746
- What about it?
- It locked from the outside.

35:36.789 --> 35:38.487
Place wasn't built
to keep people out.

35:38.530 --> 35:41.533
It was built to keep people in.

35:41.577 --> 35:44.145
You think you can
get us out of here?

35:45.189 --> 35:48.975
I mean, you've gotten
out of worse, haven't you?

35:49.019 --> 35:52.153
A place this size should have
two or three emergency shafts.

35:52.196 --> 35:56.026
We find the outside wall,
we'll find a way out.

36:13.652 --> 36:15.219
Pronger, Kelly.

36:46.163 --> 36:48.426
What's a hospital
doing down here?

37:04.834 --> 37:07.010
Major, you should see this.

37:08.620 --> 37:11.014
- Over there.
- Pronger, stand down.

37:11.057 --> 37:13.234
Doctor, with me.

38:25.915 --> 38:27.482
My fucking light.

38:33.139 --> 38:34.358
Shh.

38:35.403 --> 38:37.709
Damn.

38:37.753 --> 38:39.320
Quiet!

38:50.896 --> 38:52.985
Oh, shit!

39:03.039 --> 39:04.780
Let's go. Come on.

39:14.877 --> 39:16.400
Out of the way.

39:16.444 --> 39:17.967
Behind you!

39:36.420 --> 39:37.813
Berton!

39:43.862 --> 39:44.862
Let's go.

39:52.218 --> 39:53.698
Oh, bloody hell.

39:53.742 --> 39:56.222
Reiner's built
an entire city down here.

39:56.266 --> 39:58.573
The Wotan rumors were true.

40:01.489 --> 40:03.708
"Laboratorium." Labs.

40:03.752 --> 40:07.233
You were right.
We have to go down there.

40:07.277 --> 40:08.950
What about the tunneler?
How long has it been?

40:08.974 --> 40:11.673
- Well, he'll have to wait.
- What if he doesn't?

40:12.848 --> 40:15.416
Cooper said
he'd come back for you, yes?

40:15.459 --> 40:16.634
He wouldn't leave us behind.

40:16.678 --> 40:17.872
Then he'll bring Berton
with him.

40:17.896 --> 40:19.463
Focus on the task at hand.

40:19.507 --> 40:22.292
We'll be done before you know it
now that we have the map.

40:22.335 --> 40:24.076
For all we know,
thatcould be a shaft.

40:24.120 --> 40:25.295
Or that.

40:25.338 --> 40:26.707
And what if these exits
are blocked in?

40:26.731 --> 40:28.254
We'll deal with it then!

41:19.218 --> 41:24.267
Scheisse! Scheisse!
Scheisse! Scheisse!

42:00.912 --> 42:03.959
Wait, Doc, Doc, Doc.
Doc, look. His stomach.

42:33.031 --> 42:35.599
I spring a leak, you can start
to worry about me, okay?

42:39.168 --> 42:42.650
This place
is crawling with Germans.

42:42.693 --> 42:44.565
You ever see anything like that?

42:44.608 --> 42:48.264
I've seen
some ugly fucking Huns before.

42:48.307 --> 42:49.570
Never quite that ugly.

42:51.006 --> 42:54.487
And I've never seen them
kill each other.

42:54.531 --> 42:57.316
You know something about this
place you're not telling me?

42:59.014 --> 43:02.278
Huh? Jennings tell you anything?

43:02.321 --> 43:03.496
Nothing.

43:03.540 --> 43:05.107
My CO gave me my orders...

43:05.150 --> 43:07.283
Get Jennings in and out
without so much of a scratch.

43:07.326 --> 43:10.242
And your CO
didn't tell you anything?

43:11.156 --> 43:13.985
- Didn't know.
- Didn't tell you.

43:14.029 --> 43:15.987
Didn't know.

43:16.031 --> 43:19.861
But whatever
Jennings is doing down here

43:19.904 --> 43:24.387
is important enough
to secure the full cooperation

43:24.430 --> 43:26.389
of the American army.

43:26.432 --> 43:27.956
How else could he get

43:27.999 --> 43:29.827
a whole division down here
to help us out?

43:29.871 --> 43:32.438
Let me tell you something else
you don't know.

43:32.482 --> 43:34.702
Nobody is fucking coming for us.

43:34.745 --> 43:37.052
Jennings is a fucking liar.

43:39.620 --> 43:41.186
What is a scheisse, anyway?

43:41.230 --> 43:43.885
You be quiet, please.
Give me some light.

43:45.800 --> 43:47.497
- What are you looking for?
- Answers.

43:47.540 --> 43:50.848
If I could see anything.
Light, please.

44:04.775 --> 44:05.907
Ugh.

44:17.570 --> 44:20.965
Major, open up
this side, please.

44:26.884 --> 44:28.843
Hold the table, you two.

44:52.693 --> 44:53.868
- Oh!
- Oh!

44:55.870 --> 44:58.263
Light, please.

45:23.027 --> 45:24.507
What is it?

45:24.550 --> 45:27.902
I think it's a type
of Dirofilaria.

45:27.945 --> 45:29.686
American, Doc.

45:29.730 --> 45:31.732
Parasitic worm.

45:31.775 --> 45:33.559
Like you would see
in cats or dogs.

45:33.603 --> 45:36.214
A heartworm.

45:36.258 --> 45:40.479
But humans can't contract
these worms.

45:40.523 --> 45:44.701
Not in this quantity or size.

45:44.745 --> 45:46.747
Well, this is truly...

45:49.140 --> 45:50.751
extraordinary.

46:10.118 --> 46:11.815
Oh!

46:26.003 --> 46:27.483
They've, uh...

46:28.614 --> 46:31.487
They've occupied
his orbital cavities,

46:31.530 --> 46:35.012
the sinuses,
the prefrontal cortex.

46:35.056 --> 46:36.405
What?

46:36.448 --> 46:39.190
Well, the frontal lobe
governs our personalities.

46:39.234 --> 46:42.411
It's how we tell
right from wrong.

46:42.454 --> 46:45.893
The tiniest lesions there
can cause dementia.

46:47.372 --> 46:50.071
This is not
a natural phenomenon.

46:51.289 --> 46:53.509
This disease was engineered.

47:13.964 --> 47:15.313
Achtung.

47:38.206 --> 47:41.644
You ever get scared
down here, places like this?

47:42.950 --> 47:45.822
They say you're only scared
when you got something to lose.

47:45.866 --> 47:48.694
You got something to lose?

47:48.738 --> 47:50.827
I'm scared all the time.

47:50.871 --> 47:52.960
Yeah. What's her name?

47:55.876 --> 47:57.442
Veronique.

47:59.314 --> 48:01.620
Veronique. That's a nice name.

48:04.623 --> 48:06.321
We're close.

48:22.163 --> 48:24.078
Right. Let's go.

48:35.480 --> 48:39.571
I said, "Let's go."

48:46.100 --> 48:47.840
I don't think so.

48:47.884 --> 48:51.279
We're gonna find that tunneler,
and then we leave.

48:55.370 --> 48:58.068
All right.
This has gone far enough.

48:58.112 --> 49:00.636
I gave you a direct order!

49:04.553 --> 49:07.991
You're heading down a very
hazardous path, Sergeant.

49:08.035 --> 49:11.821
More hazardous than following
your sorry ass around?

49:13.518 --> 49:15.520
Not one more step.

49:19.829 --> 49:22.136
Drop it.

49:32.102 --> 49:34.539
This is mutiny.

49:37.368 --> 49:38.761
You'll hang.

49:38.804 --> 49:41.024
We live long enough
to get out of here,

49:41.068 --> 49:43.113
and we'll worry about that.

49:47.248 --> 49:49.511
Drop your weapon.

49:49.554 --> 49:50.903
I'm warning you!

49:50.947 --> 49:52.122
Gentlemen.

49:52.166 --> 49:54.864
We're on the same side.
Everybody...

49:54.907 --> 49:56.822
Everybody lower
your weapons now.

49:56.866 --> 50:00.391
I ain't dying down here
so this prick can make colonel.

50:00.435 --> 50:03.003
Listen to me.
Listen to me, gentlemen.

50:04.265 --> 50:09.400
Men of the 49th Infantry are
mustering above us right now.

50:09.444 --> 50:11.924
If you drop your weapons,
I will see to it...

50:11.968 --> 50:13.491
Oh, cut the shit, Jennings.

50:20.063 --> 50:21.934
Drop it or I fire!

50:21.978 --> 50:24.372
I'm warning you!

50:26.504 --> 50:28.680
This is your last chance!

50:53.009 --> 50:56.230
Ohh.

50:58.014 --> 50:59.624
Okay.

51:01.191 --> 51:02.801
Let's go back for the others.

51:02.845 --> 51:05.761
Hey, you're in no shape
to go hunting for your men.

51:05.804 --> 51:08.155
I say we send a team to come
back looking for them, okay?

51:08.198 --> 51:09.330
Come on, let's go.

51:09.373 --> 51:11.027
Look, I promised
I would go back for them.

51:11.071 --> 51:14.074
This place is a maze.
We're outnumbered.

51:14.117 --> 51:16.467
We're lucky to be alive.

51:16.511 --> 51:18.228
Even if we make it back
to the meeting point,

51:18.252 --> 51:20.167
there's no guarantee
they'll be there.

51:22.343 --> 51:24.127
Listen, I tested fate
once before.

51:24.171 --> 51:25.607
Yeah, you lived.

51:28.392 --> 51:30.046
I was lucky.

51:31.917 --> 51:34.659
Look, I'm sorry
nobody came back for you.

51:36.052 --> 51:37.575
But if there's a chance...

51:39.186 --> 51:40.839
we go.

54:25.787 --> 54:28.093
You are men of action,
so I will be brief.

54:28.137 --> 54:29.834
We have come to
destroy the compound,

54:29.878 --> 54:31.358
and we need your tunneler.

54:31.401 --> 54:34.143
Cooperate, and your lives
will be spared.

54:34.186 --> 54:35.362
No.

54:35.405 --> 54:36.972
Until we know what
spreads this disease,

54:37.015 --> 54:38.775
no attempt should be made
to leave this base.

54:38.800 --> 54:42.020
If you wish to be in
this place when it is destroyed,

54:42.064 --> 54:43.283
you may be my guest.

54:43.326 --> 54:45.110
Does he speak for all of you?

54:47.069 --> 54:48.070
Good.

54:48.113 --> 54:50.986
Then who among you
is the tunneler?

55:04.391 --> 55:06.349
I'm the tunneler.

55:06.393 --> 55:08.220
You?

55:14.401 --> 55:17.055
You're very tall for a tunneler.

55:18.187 --> 55:19.884
That's what my mother said.

55:19.928 --> 55:23.758
Oh, yeah. Yes.

55:23.801 --> 55:26.108
All right, the rest of you
will assist him.

55:26.151 --> 55:27.346
Berton, nobody should leave here

55:27.370 --> 55:29.067
until we get some
bloody answers.

55:29.111 --> 55:32.375
Fine.
You may remain here under guard.

55:32.419 --> 55:36.640
Gentlemen, this base
has been sealed for a reason.

55:36.684 --> 55:38.575
There has been an outbreak here
the likes of which

55:38.599 --> 55:41.602
I've never seen
in my years of medicine.

55:41.645 --> 55:44.648
And you can't stop it, can you?

55:44.692 --> 55:46.389
Can you?

56:01.883 --> 56:04.842
- Come.
- Danke schoen.

56:05.800 --> 56:07.584
Follow me.

56:28.257 --> 56:29.824
We're going to descend
two levels

56:29.867 --> 56:32.783
to where the main charge
failed to detonate.

56:32.827 --> 56:35.612
The tunneler will fix them.

56:35.656 --> 56:38.702
Any explosives that need to be
carried, you will help him.

56:38.746 --> 56:40.071
How are we supposed
to defend ourselves

56:40.095 --> 56:42.402
if we run into
any more of your pals?

56:42.445 --> 56:46.014
You do your job,
and I will see to your safety.

56:46.057 --> 56:47.450
Come.

57:27.447 --> 57:28.796
Mmm.

57:28.839 --> 57:32.060
There's so much joy
in the food the French make.

57:32.103 --> 57:36.368
They are a disgrace
on the battlefield,

57:36.412 --> 57:38.153
but they certainly
have their talents.

57:45.116 --> 57:46.509
Ahh.

57:48.206 --> 57:50.948
Do you know how much joy
is in German food?

58:01.568 --> 58:04.832
It has been quite the week
for the democracies, no?

58:04.875 --> 58:09.010
The Hindenburg Line smashed.
The Fritz on the run.

58:09.053 --> 58:10.968
How exciting.

58:11.012 --> 58:13.580
But I'm wondering
what you will do next.

58:13.623 --> 58:17.018
Consolidate your gains
in the Argonne,

58:17.061 --> 58:20.412
or exploit your breakthrough
at Cambrai?

58:21.413 --> 58:23.067
I vote for Cambrai.

58:26.418 --> 58:29.770
The mustering point
of the next Allied attack.

58:29.813 --> 58:32.163
What about it?

58:33.774 --> 58:35.210
Where is it?

58:35.253 --> 58:37.691
Well, I'm a doctor.

58:37.734 --> 58:40.563
You're asking the wrong man.

58:40.607 --> 58:42.652
You...

58:42.696 --> 58:44.654
You are obviously
a medical officer

58:44.698 --> 58:46.961
attached to
British intelligence.

58:48.179 --> 58:49.964
Where is it?

58:50.007 --> 58:52.967
I couldn't tell you,
Herr Reiner.

58:57.406 --> 58:58.538
Johann.

59:06.807 --> 59:09.026
Let's forget...

59:10.114 --> 59:13.770
for a moment
that we are enemies.

59:16.991 --> 59:22.344
After all, we are friends
in science, aren't we?

59:25.477 --> 59:29.743
So, what did you find

59:29.786 --> 59:32.354
on your little expedition?

59:32.615 --> 59:35.618
That you and I don't practice
the same science.

59:35.662 --> 59:38.621
Of course we do.

59:38.665 --> 59:43.495
When a person falls ill,
do you heal them with words,

59:43.539 --> 59:45.672
or do you cut them open
and rearrange their insides?

59:45.715 --> 59:48.109
- I do what I have to do.
- Exactly.

59:48.152 --> 59:50.198
This is the only criterion

59:50.241 --> 59:52.156
under which
science should be judged...

59:52.200 --> 59:54.855
Its effectiveness.

59:54.898 --> 59:56.334
You think...

59:56.378 --> 59:59.337
You think cutting a man open
with a scalpel

59:59.381 --> 01:00:01.688
is not an act of aggression?

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:06.910
Because to fix him, you have
to inflict a violence upon him.

01:00:06.954 --> 01:00:09.609
An educated violence.

01:00:09.652 --> 01:00:11.915
A violence
you went to school for.

01:00:14.657 --> 01:00:19.357
And what you're doing here
has nothing to do with science.

01:00:19.401 --> 01:00:21.403
It's a perversion...

01:00:23.361 --> 01:00:24.798
Now, we know that
you've engineered

01:00:24.841 --> 01:00:26.582
some sort of parasite,

01:00:26.626 --> 01:00:30.020
presumably designed to devastate
Allied livestock.

01:00:30.064 --> 01:00:32.544
So I think that you've had
a little accident,

01:00:32.588 --> 01:00:35.069
and your strain
has jumped species,

01:00:35.112 --> 01:00:38.028
and you've tried to seal
this base to stop it spreading.

01:00:41.379 --> 01:00:45.079
No one was more surprised
than myself once it jumped.

01:00:45.732 --> 01:00:50.867
But I started breeding a more
virulent strain of the parasite,

01:00:50.911 --> 01:00:54.088
and within months
I had created one

01:00:54.131 --> 01:00:57.700
that could overwhelm its host
in a matter of hours.

01:00:57.744 --> 01:00:59.571
Even before it migrates
to the brain,

01:00:59.615 --> 01:01:01.573
the fever caused
by the infestation

01:01:01.617 --> 01:01:04.359
can radically alter
the personality.

01:01:04.402 --> 01:01:07.971
But once it reaches
the cerebral tissue,

01:01:08.015 --> 01:01:13.934
the results are,
well, spectacular.

01:01:16.458 --> 01:01:20.418
Some like to fornicate.

01:01:20.462 --> 01:01:23.073
Others drink.

01:01:23.117 --> 01:01:24.814
But most...

01:01:25.772 --> 01:01:27.730
they just want to kill.

01:01:35.042 --> 01:01:37.697
Quite liberating,
I should think, no?

01:01:50.405 --> 01:01:53.669
Let's go.
It's time to get moving.

01:01:53.713 --> 01:01:55.279
Let's go.
We don't have time for this!

01:01:55.323 --> 01:01:56.716
Hey, easy, Fritz.

01:01:56.759 --> 01:01:58.892
You know, I'm pretty good
with those maps.

01:01:58.935 --> 01:02:00.502
Kelly, hey.

01:02:00.545 --> 01:02:03.244
I can help you find your way.
You got to show me the map.

01:02:03.287 --> 01:02:04.767
Got to move, okay?

01:02:04.811 --> 01:02:07.552
Come on. Kelly? Kelly?

01:02:08.466 --> 01:02:09.466
Aah!

01:02:11.382 --> 01:02:14.951
Aah! No! No! Oh!

01:02:14.995 --> 01:02:16.213
No! My nose!

01:02:16.257 --> 01:02:18.738
Aah!

01:02:42.849 --> 01:02:44.676
- Give me the map.
- No.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:47.592
Don't make me shoot you.
Give me the map.

01:02:47.636 --> 01:02:51.335
You're the only who knows
how the wire the explosives.

01:02:51.379 --> 01:02:54.338
This is an outbreak,
and we can't control it.

01:02:54.382 --> 01:02:56.645
Look at your friends.

01:02:56.688 --> 01:02:57.951
Look at them.

01:03:00.214 --> 01:03:01.432
Germany has lost the war,

01:03:01.476 --> 01:03:04.958
but there will be no peace
if this gets out.

01:03:05.001 --> 01:03:07.961
Don't do this for me.

01:03:08.004 --> 01:03:10.964
Think of the lives you can save.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.770
Thank you.

01:03:34.814 --> 01:03:38.078
Like you said,
I'm not doing this for you.

01:03:38.121 --> 01:03:39.862
Which way?

01:03:41.124 --> 01:03:43.431
Down and to the left.

01:03:50.481 --> 01:03:52.396
You think
an outbreak in our lines

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.050
would allow you
to counterattack?

01:03:54.094 --> 01:03:57.184
This awful war is finished.
It's over.

01:03:57.227 --> 01:04:00.056
Think about
the civilian casualties.

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:02.189
And what about your blockade?

01:04:02.232 --> 01:04:06.280
This euphemism for
the premeditated starvation

01:04:06.323 --> 01:04:07.890
of thousands of innocent lives?

01:04:07.934 --> 01:04:11.676
You, sir, are in no position
to lecture me about morality.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.418
Agreed. Then think about
your own people.

01:04:14.462 --> 01:04:16.420
This monstrosity
won't recognize any flag.

01:04:16.464 --> 01:04:17.813
So be it.

01:04:17.857 --> 01:04:22.078
Consider it a radical surgery
to save the host.

01:04:22.122 --> 01:04:23.819
If Germany loses this war,

01:04:23.863 --> 01:04:26.996
it will fall to the democrats
or the communists...

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.780
The herd or the Jews...

01:04:28.824 --> 01:04:32.306
And I will not allow
either to happen.

01:04:32.349 --> 01:04:34.264
So you're gonna drag it
all down with you,

01:04:34.308 --> 01:04:37.441
hmm, like some petulant demigod

01:04:37.485 --> 01:04:39.617
in one of your
fucking Wagner operas?

01:04:40.575 --> 01:04:44.535
Perhaps I will drag it down.
And why not?!

01:04:44.579 --> 01:04:49.714
Europe is a perfumed corpse
waiting to be set ablaze.

01:04:50.759 --> 01:04:53.762
And if Germany is strong enough,
brave enough,

01:04:53.805 --> 01:04:56.373
then it will emerge purified

01:04:56.417 --> 01:04:59.115
while the rest of
this dung heap burns!

01:04:59.159 --> 01:05:02.031
And if it perish, so be it.

01:05:02.075 --> 01:05:04.164
It wasn't up to the task.

01:05:11.171 --> 01:05:12.694
The mustering point.

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:02.396
- Gramophone?
- Of course.

01:06:02.439 --> 01:06:03.832
Huh!

01:06:03.875 --> 01:06:05.877
My God.

01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:10.795
What did you think
I was going to do?

01:06:13.755 --> 01:06:16.279
I rather thought you were
going to torture me.

01:06:16.323 --> 01:06:18.673
But I am.

01:06:22.372 --> 01:06:23.634
When the line broke,

01:06:23.678 --> 01:06:25.593
the order was given
to destroy this compound.

01:06:25.636 --> 01:06:27.377
They were able to
contain the infected,

01:06:27.421 --> 01:06:30.554
but this main charge never went.

01:06:30.598 --> 01:06:32.208
How do I know I'm not infected?

01:06:32.252 --> 01:06:35.037
We were told it only transmits
through bodily fluids,

01:06:35.081 --> 01:06:36.517
through blood, through saliva.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.041
- Well, what are the symptoms?
- Begins with a fever.

01:06:39.085 --> 01:06:42.610
You become increasingly violent.
How do youfeel?

01:06:42.653 --> 01:06:45.787
I feel like
blowing something up.

01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:48.050
That is a symptom.

01:06:53.621 --> 01:06:55.405
Can you salvage the explosives?

01:06:55.449 --> 01:06:59.627
Oh, the explosives are fine.
Detonators are fine.

01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:01.237
Then what's the problem?

01:07:01.281 --> 01:07:03.631
They weren't connected.

01:07:03.674 --> 01:07:06.721
Somebody wasn't ready
to say goodbye.

01:07:58.642 --> 01:08:01.210
I found more det cord.

01:08:01.254 --> 01:08:03.299
How much longer?

01:08:03.343 --> 01:08:04.692
Finish wiring the explosives,

01:08:04.735 --> 01:08:06.607
bring it up to the charges
on the second floor,

01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:08.043
then up to the surface.

01:08:08.087 --> 01:08:09.827
Good.

01:08:16.573 --> 01:08:19.228
I found these in the guard room.

01:08:22.710 --> 01:08:25.015
Thank you.

01:08:29.456 --> 01:08:30.587
Prost.

01:08:32.111 --> 01:08:33.808
- Prost.
- Prost.

01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:36.854
Prost.Cheers.

01:08:36.898 --> 01:08:38.203
Cheers.

01:08:43.033 --> 01:08:45.211
German beer. You like?

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:48.562
I like.

01:08:48.604 --> 01:08:51.782
To the end of the war.

01:08:51.826 --> 01:08:53.131
I'll drink to that.

01:09:03.881 --> 01:09:08.189
You know, they say that
this disease drives men insane.

01:09:08.234 --> 01:09:11.889
But I believe
after the last four years,

01:09:11.933 --> 01:09:14.327
both sides
have already been infected.

01:09:17.198 --> 01:09:19.201
I was on the Somme,

01:09:19.245 --> 01:09:23.553
and we were shelled
for seven days straight.

01:09:23.596 --> 01:09:27.904
Even deep down in the dugout,
the sound was deafening.

01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:33.868
After 72 hours, some of the men
began to kill themselves.

01:09:33.911 --> 01:09:36.392
One of my men...

01:09:38.089 --> 01:09:41.397
put a grenade in his mouth,

01:09:41.441 --> 01:09:45.966
and I spent the next day
picking his teeth out of my arm,

01:09:47.969 --> 01:09:52.408
And after five days,
I crawled up to the top,

01:09:52.452 --> 01:09:54.149
out of the dugout...

01:09:55.237 --> 01:09:57.631
and I think I wanted to die.

01:09:59.807 --> 01:10:04.333
And there I watched
the fields rise and fall,

01:10:04.377 --> 01:10:10.121
remade and destroyed again
with each new salvo.

01:10:11.297 --> 01:10:12.602
And for what?

01:10:15.301 --> 01:10:20.654
To kill a handful of Germans
cowering in a little hole?

01:10:20.697 --> 01:10:22.699
Yeah, well, maybe...

01:10:24.266 --> 01:10:27.791
Maybe after what
both sides have done,

01:10:27.835 --> 01:10:30.272
we all deserve to be wiped out.

01:10:35.625 --> 01:10:37.453
Just not today.

01:10:42.066 --> 01:10:44.504
Not today.

01:11:06.482 --> 01:11:08.484
Gas! Gas!

01:11:22.324 --> 01:11:24.283
Come! Down this way!

01:11:27.373 --> 01:11:28.548
Up!

01:12:09.937 --> 01:12:11.591
Okay.
Let's go through this again.

01:12:11.634 --> 01:12:12.896
Which way did you enter?

01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:14.985
We came down here
through the emergency exit.

01:12:15.029 --> 01:12:16.659
That's going to
be filled with gas

01:12:16.683 --> 01:12:20.382
just like the other exits,
so that's not gonna work either.

01:12:22.341 --> 01:12:24.212
There.

01:12:24.255 --> 01:12:25.822
Thank God
for German engineering.

01:12:25.866 --> 01:12:28.259
- What is that?
- It's an auxiliary shaft.

01:12:28.303 --> 01:12:31.262
They use it to bring mining cars
up they've filled with spoils,

01:12:31.306 --> 01:12:33.656
keep the main tunnels clear
when they're digging.

01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.354
That will take us up
to the next level.

01:12:35.397 --> 01:12:37.356
Yeah, but what about
the explosives?

01:12:37.399 --> 01:12:40.054
How do we detonate?

01:12:40.097 --> 01:12:42.056
- What's that? Sleeping quarters?
- Yeah.

01:12:42.099 --> 01:12:45.755
Personal belongings.
Let me go through them.

01:12:53.459 --> 01:12:55.199
In case they stop us,

01:12:55.243 --> 01:12:57.288
I'm setting the detonation
from here.

01:12:57.332 --> 01:12:58.507
How much time will we have?

01:12:58.551 --> 01:13:01.771
I'm giving us 45 minutes.

01:13:01.815 --> 01:13:03.991
But this is not gonna be enough
to finish the job.

01:13:04.034 --> 01:13:06.733
We got to run the det cord
up to the next level.

01:13:06.776 --> 01:13:09.997
Whatever survives the blast
will be engulfed in flames.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.260
At least the labs
will be destroyed.

01:13:12.303 --> 01:13:14.305
Let this be the last.

01:13:14.349 --> 01:13:15.872
- Your back!
- Aah!

01:13:24.751 --> 01:13:27.101
Oh!

01:14:01.918 --> 01:14:03.746
Can you fix this?

01:14:05.922 --> 01:14:07.968
I'll rig something else up.

01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:11.798
Yeah?

01:14:11.841 --> 01:14:14.148
And how about my leg?

01:14:17.673 --> 01:14:20.328
Well, you're not gonna waltz
for a while, but you'll live.

01:14:22.548 --> 01:14:25.420
Just show me how to do it.

01:14:26.987 --> 01:14:28.597
Show you how to do what?

01:14:32.253 --> 01:14:34.734
You and I both know
what needs to happen.

01:14:38.433 --> 01:14:40.914
Just show me.

01:14:48.574 --> 01:14:52.186
You bring the two together.
Electricity will do the rest.

01:14:53.056 --> 01:14:54.493
Just touch them?

01:14:56.582 --> 01:14:58.671
And how much time do you need?

01:15:00.803 --> 01:15:03.327
I need 20 minutes
to make it to the next level,

01:15:03.371 --> 01:15:06.461
five minutes
to rig the explosives.

01:15:06.505 --> 01:15:08.724
30 minutes to be sure.

01:15:15.949 --> 01:15:17.864
I give you till 7:00.

01:19:12.228 --> 01:19:13.664
Aah!

01:19:23.413 --> 01:19:27.113
Good God.
One of those colonials.

01:19:27.156 --> 01:19:31.204
What are you even doing here?
This is not your war.

01:19:35.338 --> 01:19:38.254
Aaah!

01:19:42.911 --> 01:19:43.956
On your knees.

01:19:45.435 --> 01:19:46.523
On your knees!

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:56.533
And now raise your hands.

01:19:57.665 --> 01:19:59.710
Put your hands up!

01:20:00.799 --> 01:20:01.974
Yeah.

01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:11.244
Aaah!

01:20:46.105 --> 01:20:48.411
You stupid Canadian.

01:20:49.935 --> 01:20:53.547
You are going to die
underneath a French field

01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:57.943
thousands of miles from home,

01:20:57.986 --> 01:20:59.205
and you're smiling.

01:21:00.554 --> 01:21:03.252
Why are you smiling?

01:21:03.296 --> 01:21:06.125
I know they call you
the Prophet, but...

01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:08.954
I know something you don't.

01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:12.131
What might that be?

01:21:14.176 --> 01:21:16.048
I know how this ends.

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:23.299
