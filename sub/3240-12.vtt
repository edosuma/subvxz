We're both a little guarded,
a little screwed up.

40:45.977 --> 40:48.244
Maybe a lot screwed up.

40:48.246 --> 40:51.181
And we both
have killed people.

40:51.183 --> 40:52.715
It leaves
you feeling like

40:52.717 --> 40:54.717
You have to make up for it
somehow...

40:54.719 --> 40:57.220
You know, you have
to solve every case,

40:57.222 --> 40:58.755
Maybe throw yourself
in front of a few cars

40:58.757 --> 41:01.124
To make sure
a bad guy doesn't get away.

41:01.126 --> 41:04.761
But it doesn't work,
none of it.

41:10.669 --> 41:14.270
I didn't
have to kill him.

[ sighs ]

41:18.109 --> 41:21.945
I shouldn't have,
but i did.

41:23.882 --> 41:26.950
And that's something
i'm gonna have to live with.

41:26.952 --> 41:29.953
Forever.

41:29.955 --> 41:31.387
Me too.

41:31.389 --> 41:35.625
Can i tell you something,
henry?

41:35.627 --> 41:38.428
For me...

41:38.430 --> 41:41.297
You make that
a little easier.

41:41.299 --> 41:43.800
I just...

41:43.802 --> 41:47.303
I just want to be
able to do the same for you.

[ cellphone ringing ]

41:56.181 --> 41:59.883
Hey. What's up?

41:59.885 --> 42:03.419
Okay. Right now?

42:03.421 --> 42:04.821
I'm on my way.

42:06.958 --> 42:09.058
How would you like
to see a dead body?

42:09.060 --> 42:11.961
I thought
you'd never ask.
