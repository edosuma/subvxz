WEBVTT

00:00.544 --> 00:03.547
<i>You're watching Animation Abomination!</i>

00:03.591 --> 00:05.810
<i>Now back to "Kingdom of Lore"!</i>

00:05.854 --> 00:08.596
You'll never get away
with this, Ghost!

00:08.639 --> 00:10.641
You think you can defeat me?

00:10.685 --> 00:12.251
Oh, snap!

00:12.295 --> 00:15.341
Looks like this ghost
is gonna make us toast!

00:15.385 --> 00:18.823
<i>Don't miss the exciting next
episode of "Kingdom of Lore"!</i>

00:19.302 --> 00:21.522
Wow, this show is awesome!

00:22.392 --> 00:23.587
I know! I've seenall the episodes,

00:23.611 --> 00:24.960
read al the books,

00:25.003 --> 00:26.657
and they makemy favorite cereal!

00:26.701 --> 00:28.572
This is the first episode
I've seen.

00:28.616 --> 00:30.531
It makes no sense,
and I love it!

00:30.574 --> 00:32.576
How do you think
the season will end?

00:32.620 --> 00:35.536
I have a theory
that the evil ghost
is actually the king.

00:35.579 --> 00:39.104
- Ha ha, that's cool, but
I think the main girl lady...
- Princess Tarina.

00:39.148 --> 00:41.542
Princess Tortilla,
I think it'd be cool

00:41.585 --> 00:43.761
if she blows everything up
because she's evil now!

00:45.763 --> 00:48.200
Brother, that would
never happen.

00:48.244 --> 00:50.899
As someone who has seen every
episode of "Kingdom of Lore",

00:50.942 --> 00:52.770
leave the creative ideas to me.

00:52.814 --> 00:54.685
I have good ideas!

00:54.729 --> 00:56.165
Sometimes!

00:56.208 --> 00:58.341
Excuse me,
but have you written 1200 pages

00:58.384 --> 01:00.343
of "Kingdom of Lore" fanfiction?

01:00.386 --> 01:02.911
Well, just cause I haven't
doesn't mean I couldn't.

01:02.954 --> 01:04.521
Oh hey, "Kingdom of Lore".

01:04.565 --> 01:06.020
I just got a job
working on that show.

01:06.044 --> 01:08.351
You work on "Kingdom of Lore"?

01:08.394 --> 01:10.571
Eh, technically I'm an intern,
so I'm not getting paid,

01:10.614 --> 01:12.374
In fact I had to enroll
at a community college

01:12.398 --> 01:13.617
to even qualify,

01:13.661 --> 01:15.663
so I'm actually paying
to work there.

01:15.706 --> 01:19.710
- Please, please, pleasetake us! Take us, Gloria!
- Yeah, okay.

01:19.754 --> 01:23.148
Wow, Gloria! I can't believe
you help make cartoons!

01:23.192 --> 01:26.761
You must have nonstop fun!

01:26.804 --> 01:28.458
Okay, just remember
that the creators

01:28.501 --> 01:30.025
of "Kingdom of Lore"
are my bosses,

01:30.068 --> 01:31.461
so don't do anything stupid.

01:31.504 --> 01:33.376
We won't.

01:33.419 --> 01:34.986
Hey, Topher? Blaine?

01:35.030 --> 01:37.380
Oh! I see you're wearing
your sibling shirt, again.

01:37.423 --> 01:41.036
Of course!
Brothers who work together,
wear big shirt together!

01:41.079 --> 01:43.821
Say, why don't you
introduce us to your guests?

01:43.865 --> 01:45.823
We're Gloria's best friends!

01:45.867 --> 01:49.174
No, no, they're...
Oh, crud, they are.

01:49.218 --> 01:51.263
- I'm Topher!
- And I'm Blaine!

01:51.307 --> 01:53.222
And we're the showrunners!

01:53.265 --> 01:56.660
Wow, a team
of creative siblings.

01:56.704 --> 01:58.749
- Can't relate.
- Me?

01:58.793 --> 02:00.838
Are you saying I'm not creative?

02:00.882 --> 02:02.797
Hah, Topher and I bicker
a lot, too.

02:02.840 --> 02:06.017
But the rewardsof a creative partnership
make it all worth it!

02:06.061 --> 02:09.238
- We don't bicker!
- Yes, we do!

02:09.281 --> 02:13.068
That's it! Sibling shirt
is coming off!

02:13.111 --> 02:16.811
But hey, would you kids
like a tour of the studio?

02:16.854 --> 02:20.031
Yeah!
Follow me!

02:20.075 --> 02:22.468
There's a lot of steps
in making a cartoon,

02:22.512 --> 02:24.688
but it all starts
in the writer's room!

02:24.732 --> 02:26.255
We have writers block!

02:26.298 --> 02:27.493
We can't come up with anything

02:27.517 --> 02:28.953
for our big season finale!

02:28.997 --> 02:30.694
Uh oh! Problem!

02:30.738 --> 02:32.870
- We need to come up
with an ending!
- And fast!

02:32.914 --> 02:34.655
Well, I have an idea!

02:34.698 --> 02:37.832
What if the evil Ghost
was the King from Season One?

02:37.875 --> 02:40.399
And Princess Tarina
must fight him
to reclaim her kingdom,

02:40.443 --> 02:42.619
therefore paying off
seasons' worth of buildup

02:42.663 --> 02:45.100
in a dramatic
and emotionally satisfying way!

02:45.143 --> 02:47.798
That is brilliant!

02:47.842 --> 02:50.496
But, what if it turns out
Princess Tostada

02:50.540 --> 02:52.063
was evil the whole time!

02:52.107 --> 02:54.892
And everything...

02:54.936 --> 02:56.677
Explodes.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.983
That is easy!

02:59.027 --> 03:00.768
- How long til lunch?
- Five minutes.

03:00.811 --> 03:02.813
We go with the easy idea.

03:02.857 --> 03:03.814
Yay!

03:03.858 --> 03:05.729
Get writing!

03:06.817 --> 03:08.079
Good show writing, Blaine.

03:08.123 --> 03:09.341
You too, Topher.

03:09.385 --> 03:11.648
Wait! But what about my ending?

03:11.692 --> 03:13.911
Hm. Cricket, could we talk
in the kitchen?

03:13.955 --> 03:15.043
Okay!

03:15.086 --> 03:17.872
A toast, to my brilliant ideas!

03:17.915 --> 03:19.700
Cricket, your ending
is hot garbage.

03:19.743 --> 03:21.702
Well, it's true!

03:21.745 --> 03:23.878
Nah, it's this weird
French soda.

03:23.921 --> 03:26.707
It's got no flavor.
What the...

03:26.750 --> 03:29.753
Weird. But I was also reacting
to what you said!

03:29.797 --> 03:31.494
How could you say it's no good!

03:31.537 --> 03:33.061
This show means a lot to me,

03:33.104 --> 03:35.759
and your version ruins
Tarina's whole character!

03:35.803 --> 03:39.154
You can't sacrifice
five seasons of growth
for cheap spectacle,

03:39.197 --> 03:41.896
You've got to help me convince
them to change it back.

03:41.939 --> 03:45.682
Huh. Sounds to me like someone
is upset that their brother

03:45.726 --> 03:47.118
is a creative visionary.

03:47.162 --> 03:50.165
Looks like I do have great
and awesome ideas

03:50.208 --> 03:51.383
after all.

03:51.427 --> 03:54.082
Oh, look!

03:54.125 --> 03:56.127
Is that screening room?

03:56.171 --> 04:00.088
Wow, cool!
Hey, why are you so far away?

04:00.131 --> 04:02.786
I'm gonna grab us some popcorn
and I'll be right in.

04:02.830 --> 04:05.136
Okay, I do like popcorn.

04:05.180 --> 04:08.052
If I wanna save
"Kingdom of Lore",
I gotta act fast.

04:08.096 --> 04:10.098
Don't write that ending!

04:10.141 --> 04:13.144
The end!
And print!

04:13.188 --> 04:16.147
No, Cricket's version
doesn't make any sense!

04:16.191 --> 04:17.777
Oh, that doesn't matter.
This is animation.

04:17.801 --> 04:19.760
We can make it as stupid
as we want.

04:19.803 --> 04:22.545
Dang printer. And there!

04:22.588 --> 04:24.895
The finished script,
hot off the presses.

04:24.939 --> 04:26.810
Very hot, out of the way!

04:26.854 --> 04:28.814
Gotta deliver the script
to the storyboard artists

04:28.856 --> 04:30.292
so they can turn it
into a cartoon!

04:30.335 --> 04:32.947
Hm, not without a little help.

04:34.949 --> 04:38.604
New script, coming in hot!

04:38.648 --> 04:41.607
Oh, this battle scene
has a thousand horses!

04:41.651 --> 04:44.959
I have to draw
a thousand horses! Great!

04:46.482 --> 04:50.094
Huh? Hey! Did you change
all my drawings?

04:50.138 --> 04:54.838
<i>You have 15 seconds
left to finish story board.</i>

04:54.882 --> 04:57.319
Never mind!
Just hit the deadline!

04:57.362 --> 04:59.843
Hey, guys!
How's the board looking?

04:59.887 --> 05:02.541
- Eh.
- Good enough.

05:02.585 --> 05:04.674
Success.

05:05.936 --> 05:07.764
Cricket?
Back off!

05:07.808 --> 05:11.768
You back off!
My version is better!

05:11.812 --> 05:12.900
Quit being so stubborn!

05:12.943 --> 05:14.989
I ain't giving up
on this, Cricket!

05:16.425 --> 05:19.820
<i>- Upload complete.
- There.</i>

05:19.863 --> 05:22.866
My version is permanent,
now quit trying to interfere!

05:22.910 --> 05:23.954
It's about doing

05:23.998 --> 05:25.869
what makes sense for the show!

05:25.913 --> 05:28.350
My version makes sense!
Your just jealous!

05:28.393 --> 05:30.395
Hey, kids!
Sorry to interrupt
your squabble.

05:30.439 --> 05:31.875
Blaine and I resolved
our squabble

05:31.919 --> 05:33.790
from earlier, so now we're...

05:33.834 --> 05:35.574
Back in the big shirt!

05:35.618 --> 05:37.925
We're about to record
the actors for the episode,

05:37.968 --> 05:39.796
and thought you might
wanna sit in!

05:39.840 --> 05:41.885
Yeah! Hm.

05:41.929 --> 05:43.278
This is our recording studio,

05:43.321 --> 05:44.888
where the actors record voices

05:44.932 --> 05:46.672
for their animated characters!

05:46.716 --> 05:47.935
These talented folks

05:47.978 --> 05:49.980
can make any sound
with their voice.

05:51.634 --> 05:53.375
Wait, what happened
to your sister?

05:53.418 --> 05:55.159
So sorry I'm late.

05:55.203 --> 05:56.900
Hey, something's weird here.

05:56.944 --> 05:59.033
It looks like someone
scribbled over the script

05:59.076 --> 06:00.164
with purple crayon?

06:00.208 --> 06:01.687
Hm.

06:01.731 --> 06:03.864
What the... You did a rewrite?

06:03.907 --> 06:06.083
Now how're we supposed
to record the script?

06:09.304 --> 06:11.915
My big brain actually thought
this might happen,

06:11.959 --> 06:14.396
so I went ahead and printed
some spare copies!

06:14.439 --> 06:16.964
The good version may proceed!

06:17.007 --> 06:19.749
Ha-Cricket wins again!

06:19.792 --> 06:21.664
Guess that's it, then.

06:21.707 --> 06:23.318
The Cricket ending
is getting made

06:23.361 --> 06:26.060
and I'll watch reruns of it
for the rest of my life.

06:26.103 --> 06:27.713
No.

06:27.757 --> 06:30.064
There's gotta be a way
I can stop this.

06:30.107 --> 06:31.935
Gloria! What else
needs to be done

06:31.979 --> 06:34.329
before the episode
of animation is completed?

06:34.372 --> 06:37.245
Well I've gotta collect art
from every department
on this list, so...

06:37.288 --> 06:39.464
- Yoink!
- Or you could do it.

06:39.508 --> 06:41.945
I just gotta steal the art
from each of these people.

06:41.989 --> 06:44.034
The designers
are the ones who decide

06:44.078 --> 06:45.731
how attractive
the characters are.

06:45.775 --> 06:49.039
- Wow, looking good, you two.
- We know.

06:49.083 --> 06:51.955
The painters choose
the colors of every scene!

06:51.999 --> 06:54.958
- Huh, looks weird.
- I'm not done yet!

06:55.002 --> 06:56.307
The editor and timer.

06:56.351 --> 06:58.701
They make sure everything
in the episode moves

06:58.744 --> 07:00.094
at precisely the right time.

07:00.137 --> 07:01.443
Keep up the good work!

07:01.486 --> 07:03.967
Thank... You.

07:04.011 --> 07:05.447
Goodbye, Cricket ending!

07:05.490 --> 07:07.014
Hey, thanks for grabbing
this for me!

07:07.057 --> 07:09.581
- Dang it!
- Next, we ship
all our materials

07:09.625 --> 07:11.583
to our overseas
animation studio!

07:11.627 --> 07:13.759
Overseas? That sounds
pretty normal.

07:13.803 --> 07:14.935
Well...

07:21.593 --> 07:24.118
Make it move! Make it move!

07:24.161 --> 07:26.033
Huh, making cartoons
is way weirder

07:26.076 --> 07:28.339
-than I though it'd be.
You know it.

07:28.383 --> 07:31.995
I will now send this story
and all its artwork overseas,

07:32.039 --> 07:34.041
where they will be combined
into a cartoon.

07:34.084 --> 07:37.000
Ah! Production delay!

07:37.044 --> 07:39.089
Dang it, Tilly!
We're making that episode!

07:39.133 --> 07:41.439
Hi-ya!

07:50.144 --> 07:52.146
You just won't give up,
will you?

07:52.189 --> 07:55.801
Not until you seethe erroneous nature
of your misdeeds!

07:55.845 --> 07:58.500
How dare you,
and could you repeat that

07:58.543 --> 08:00.328
cause I didn't understand.

08:00.371 --> 08:02.112
Okay, guys, break it up.

08:02.156 --> 08:04.332
And Tilly, you can relax.
Nothing's set in stone

08:04.375 --> 08:07.030
until we get the finalapproval of the head
studio executive.

08:07.074 --> 08:09.163
Oh no! I forgot to set
the net!

08:09.206 --> 08:10.773
Everyone scatter!

08:10.816 --> 08:12.949
Whoa, the episode's
already done?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.124
That was lightening fast!

08:14.168 --> 08:15.778
That's animation for ya.

08:15.821 --> 08:17.736
When are the execs
supposed to arrive?

08:20.174 --> 08:21.566
Hi. I'm Ed Secutive,

08:21.610 --> 08:23.351
and I'm here to watch a cartoon.

08:23.394 --> 08:24.961
Ed Secutive, sir!

08:25.005 --> 08:26.547
Very excited to show you
the new episode, sir!

08:26.571 --> 08:27.659
It's a real zinger.

08:27.703 --> 08:29.139
I'll be the judge of that.

08:30.662 --> 08:33.970
Uh oh! Looks like things
are getting boomy!

08:34.014 --> 08:37.756
Yes! I'm a bad guy now!

08:42.152 --> 08:44.546
- I love it.
- So, it's approved?

08:44.589 --> 08:50.030
It will be once I finish...
This... Senten...

08:50.073 --> 08:51.553
Wait!

08:51.596 --> 08:53.424
This can't be the ending.

08:53.468 --> 08:56.079
Tarina would never
turn evil for nothing!

08:56.123 --> 08:58.168
It doesn't make sense
for her character.

08:58.212 --> 08:59.822
So I'm asking you once again

08:59.865 --> 09:03.086
to please reconsider my ending.

09:03.130 --> 09:07.221
Yes, yes!
Now that's what I call passion.

09:07.264 --> 09:08.787
I need more of that,

09:08.831 --> 09:10.137
And less "Yes" men.

09:10.180 --> 09:11.355
Sir, yes, sir!

09:11.399 --> 09:12.922
Topher, Blaine, scrap this

09:12.965 --> 09:14.793
and get to work
on changing that ending.

09:14.837 --> 09:16.578
Yes, sir! Right away, sir!

09:16.621 --> 09:18.710
Yes? Work, work.
Work, work, work, yes.

09:18.754 --> 09:20.364
Well, guess we got
an ending to rewrite.

09:20.408 --> 09:22.149
At the end of the day,
all that matters

09:22.192 --> 09:25.108
is that I get to have fun
working with my brother.

09:25.152 --> 09:27.154
Sibling shirt?

09:27.197 --> 09:29.852
Mend it, don't end it!

09:31.506 --> 09:34.117
A team of creative siblings.

09:34.161 --> 09:37.468
Mr. Secutive?
I don't think this ending
is a complete loss.

09:37.512 --> 09:40.732
Maybe we can keep a couple of...

09:40.776 --> 09:42.734
For good measure?

09:42.778 --> 09:45.911
Ha! Yes, yes!
You're full of great ideas.

09:45.955 --> 09:49.437
Well actually, those suggestions
are from my creative partner,

09:49.480 --> 09:52.266
Cricket Green.

09:52.309 --> 09:53.310
Creative partner?

09:53.354 --> 09:54.703
We have some ideas

09:54.746 --> 09:56.661
that we'd like
to pitch you. Together.

09:56.705 --> 09:59.708
I'm intrigued.
Let's talk it out over lunch.

09:59.751 --> 10:01.492
I'm starved...

10:03.190 --> 10:04.756
Sure thing!

10:05.757 --> 10:07.107
Foolish mortal!

10:07.150 --> 10:10.066
Don't you realize
I'm not just an evil ghost?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.112
I am the King! Your father!

10:12.155 --> 10:13.852
You may be my father,

10:13.896 --> 10:16.333
but I'm about to become
an orphan!

10:18.553 --> 10:21.164
That's our ending!
On TV!

10:21.208 --> 10:24.298
And because we putour big brains together
and collaborated,

10:24.341 --> 10:26.082
we were able to come up
with an ending

10:26.126 --> 10:27.562
that has something for everyone!

10:27.605 --> 10:29.565
Now let's see what the fans
on the internet think!
