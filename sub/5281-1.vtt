02:03.290 --> 02:05.042
<i>Driver's name is Arthur Shea.</i>

02:05.584 --> 02:09.884
<i>Former Medford police officer,
57 years old.</i>

02:10.047 --> 02:12.391
<i>Soon as his partner leaves 
with the coal bag...</i>

02:12.549 --> 02:16.804
<i>Artie cracks</i> The Herald,
<i>and he don't look up till the guy gets back.</i>

02:17.554 --> 02:20.899
<i>Marty MacGuire,
Cummins Armored courier.</i>

02:21.058 --> 02:24.813
<i>5'10" 220, 52 years old.</i>

02:24.978 --> 02:27.982
<i>Picks up every Wednesday and Friday
at exactly 8:12.</i>

02:28.148 --> 02:31.823
<i>Makes $110 a day. 
Carries a SIG 9.</i>

02:32.694 --> 02:35.243
<i>And he's about to get robbed.</i>

02:35.989 --> 02:39.118
We're fucked if we see a helicopter,
we're fucked if we see SWAT.

02:39.284 --> 02:42.834
We see a cruiser, stop, 
take out the engine blocks, keep moving.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.248
No one needs to get hurt.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.382
Now, these guards like to test you, though.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.465
They want to get hurt for $10 an hour,
don't get in the way.

02:51.838 --> 02:52.885
Let's go.

03:16.071 --> 03:17.118
Move!

03:17.280 --> 03:19.123
All right, 
now get away from the counter!

03:19.282 --> 03:21.125
Go! Go! Go! 
Everybody away!

03:21.284 --> 03:22.581
Back against the wall.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.456
You! Away from the computer!

03:25.622 --> 03:28.501
- Give me the fucking key!
- Back up! Back! Go! Go!

03:28.667 --> 03:31.045
- Get up! Get up!
- Get the fucking door!

03:31.211 --> 03:32.258
Get on the ground!

03:32.421 --> 03:35.220
- Get down on the ground.
- Get your fucking ass on the ground!

03:35.382 --> 03:36.884
Move! Go, go, go, go!

03:39.636 --> 03:42.139
- On the floor!
- I need everybody's BlackBerrys.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.728
- Everybody on the floor.
- Slide your BlackBerrys up.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.313
Take off your fucking shoes!

03:46.476 --> 03:49.776
BlackBerrys to the front!
Slide your fucking phones up.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.191
- The fuck you looking at?
- Take your shoes off.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.410
Get the cash drawers. 
Let's go.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.413
- Take off your fucking shoes!
- Take off your shoes.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.495
Bank manager, let's go.
Get up. Let's go.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.455
Get up, come on, get up. 
Let's go.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.962
Not you. You. Get up. Let's go.
Come on.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.666
- You trying to be a hero?
- Jesus Christ!

04:09.833 --> 04:11.961
- When's the time lock set for?
- 9:00.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.845
Don't lie to us, it's 8:15.

04:14.004 --> 04:17.132
Listen, it's not your money.
You understand? Don't lie to us again.

04:17.298 --> 04:20.644
Hey, sweetheart, in the corner.
Get in the corner. You too, brother-man.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.442
Go. Go.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.032
No distress call. 
Open it clean.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.373
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Don't stall.

04:47.078 --> 04:49.046
This guy a fucking friend of yours?

04:53.168 --> 04:54.761
Let's go!

04:54.920 --> 04:57.469
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.973
Take your time, okay?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.638
Breathe. Go.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.743
Okay, get back. 
Get out of the way.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.605
Front door.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.574
- Hello.
- Front door.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.444
Hey, you guys open?

06:19.504 --> 06:20.551
We gotta go.

06:21.423 --> 06:24.142
Let's go. 
Let's bleach it up.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.850
- Go, go, go.
- Let's bleach it up.

06:27.304 --> 06:31.480
- Come on, let's go. We gotta go.
- Hold it. Silent alarm, this address.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.565
- Who did it?
- Look, nobody did anything.

06:35.270 --> 06:38.240
- What? Huh? What'd you say?
- Nobody did anything.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.659
- You pull the alarm?
- No. No.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.569
- Did you?
- I didn't pull any alarm.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.114
We were leaving, you motherfucker! 
You fuck!

06:47.949 --> 06:49.826
Easy, easy. That's enough.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.081
- All right? Easy.
- You fuck!

06:54.247 --> 06:56.716
You fucker. 
We were out the door, you fuck.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.172
Let's go.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.013
Where's your purse?

07:19.147 --> 07:20.194
What the fuck is this?

07:20.357 --> 07:22.860
The cops get us walled in,
we're gonna need her.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.949
Sit down. Go.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.048
Head for the boulevard.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.513
You're gonna be okay.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.136
All right? 
No one's gonna hurt you.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.922
What's up?

08:18.081 --> 08:22.712
Boosted a city work van.
Which still hasn't been reported stolen.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.720
Probably too busy working.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.098
Used the van to screen the door.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.351
Bleached the entire place for DNA.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.978
Kills all the clothing fiber,
so we can't get a match.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.606
Silent bell came from cage number two.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.765
Assistant manager's at Beth Israel.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.607
Our guys waited 
for the time lock to expire...

08:39.769 --> 08:42.272
then they had the manager open sesame.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.740
Under duress?

08:45.108 --> 08:46.781
I don't know.

08:47.652 --> 08:48.778
Ten foot steel safe.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.494
Only as strong
as the guy with the key.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.582
Found the dye packs and the tracers.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.552
Found the van. Torched.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.054
- Where is it?
- Where do you think?

09:17.307 --> 09:19.150
- Nice to be back home, Dino?
- Yeah.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.818
It's all the love I get
makes the homecoming feel so warm.

09:24.814 --> 09:28.569
Could be 50 people here
eyewitnessed these guys.

09:28.735 --> 09:32.456
And 50 hands on a bible
saying they never saw nothing.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.123
Well, it's a pro job.

09:38.495 --> 09:41.499
All the pro guys I know are away...

09:42.332 --> 09:44.835
so I guess we got new pro guys.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.930
The part of the job where 
we get to do something...

09:49.089 --> 09:53.014
that has no point and yields no results.
Excuse me.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.562
Anybody see who lit this van on fire?

10:08.483 --> 10:10.406
Is that where we are now?

10:11.778 --> 10:12.870
Where's Jem?

10:13.029 --> 10:15.373
Stopped on the way
to light a couple house fires...

10:15.532 --> 10:18.160
stick up a liquor store, maybe,
I don't know.

10:18.326 --> 10:21.500
- Are we taking hostages now?
- No, we're not taking hostages now.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.837
- You gonna talk to this fucking asshole?
- For one thing--

10:26.000 --> 10:27.126
Hey.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.011
Speak of the fucking devil.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.548
You made it.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.555
- Take the scenic route?
- We got a problem.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.719
- What?
- Well, look.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.643
So what?

10:39.806 --> 10:41.558
What's the matter?
Let me see that.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.567
- Fuck.
- Oh, shit.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.275
- See the address on that?
- Bitch lives four blocks away.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.690
Yeah, I know where we are, Gloans. 
Fuck.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.076
We gonna see this bitch
on the street every day?

10:51.234 --> 10:52.406
She didn't see anything.

10:52.569 --> 10:53.991
Jesus, are you sure?

10:54.154 --> 10:56.248
- Taking her for a ride didn't help.
- Yeah.

10:56.406 --> 10:59.125
Oh, fuck.
All right. I'm gonna handle it.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.581
How you gonna handle this?

11:00.743 --> 11:03.417
I'm gonna stalk her like a fucking A car, 
we'll find out.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.582
- Find out what?
- If she needs to get scared.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.422
- She's already scared.
- Well, maybe not scared enough.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.433
Thanks, Kathy.

11:16.259 --> 11:21.265
Ms. Keesey. Special Agent Adam Frawley,
Violent Crimes and Robbery.

11:21.431 --> 11:24.435
Derek here is gonna take some
elimination prints.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.312
I see you've given
a preliminary statement.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.606
I want to talk to you
about your abduction.

11:29.772 --> 11:30.898
Okay.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.736
- I understand they threatened you.
- Mm-hm.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.497
One of them took my license.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.121
And did you try to escape
at any point?

11:40.617 --> 11:42.164
No.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.873
Is there anything you can identify about the men? 
Anything you'd testify to?

11:47.040 --> 11:49.509
I didn't try to escape
because they had guns.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.260
I understand.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.927
Then they just let you go?

11:55.089 --> 11:57.638
- Yeah. They just let me go.
- Thanks.

12:01.346 --> 12:04.896
When someone endures
an experience like this...

12:05.058 --> 12:07.811
there are very often
residual effects.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.317
It's gonna be okay.

12:11.189 --> 12:12.987
Did they say anything?

12:13.149 --> 12:17.655
"If you talk to the FBI, we'll come
to your house and fuck you and kill you."

12:17.820 --> 12:19.447
Are you gonna take care of it?

12:20.323 --> 12:22.667
- I'll do it.
- Why are you gonna do it?

12:22.825 --> 12:24.827
You're the reason
we're having this conversation.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.668
- I'm gonna get it done.
- What are you gonna get done? Huh?

12:27.997 --> 12:30.091
You get picked up
for intimidating a witness.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.799
You walk within 100 feet of her,
that's 10 years. Okay?

12:32.961 --> 12:37.011
You got two strikes against you already.
They're gonna bury you under the jail.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.264
How much money's in the sack?

12:40.426 --> 12:42.224
All right, we got 90 a pop.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.685
Minus what I had to shave off
for the Florist.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.316
Hey, Jem, what happened
with the assistant manager?

12:48.059 --> 12:51.313
Yeah. Well, next time Skeletor comes
in the bank with an AK...

12:51.479 --> 12:54.699
I think he's gonna think twice
about hitting that alarm, isn't he?

12:54.857 --> 12:56.905
He's lucky he just got tuned up.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.367
Are you gonna catch them?

13:00.154 --> 13:01.701
Yes.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.493
This is the FBI.
We're not completely inept.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.543
In fact...

13:07.954 --> 13:09.376
I know where they are.

13:10.164 --> 13:13.509
Three hundred and seventy
bank robberies in Boston last year.

13:13.668 --> 13:16.046
More per capita than
anywhere else in the world.

13:16.212 --> 13:20.558
The guys like this, hardcore guys, pros,
90 percent of them...

13:20.717 --> 13:24.187
emanate from a one-square-mile
neighborhood called Charlestown.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.939
- Familiar with it?
- You must be kidding me.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.731
First thing B.P.D. does
when there's an armored-car robbery?

13:30.893 --> 13:33.692
- Close the Charlestown Bridge.
- And he's from Charlestown.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.734
They use each other's yards, houses.
They're like rats.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.409
They ditch us pretty quick.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.866
Heisting banks is a trade in Charlestown.

13:41.029 --> 13:45.034
The way villages in old Europe
used to be known for certain crafts.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.076
In the town,
it's banks and armored cars.

13:47.493 --> 13:51.748
I don't understand it, but it makes it easier
when you know which bridge to close.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.757
Quinlan will set you up with a detail.

13:54.083 --> 13:58.088
Meantime, if there's anything your
witness specialist can't do for you...

13:59.172 --> 14:02.676
You got nothing to worry about.
We're gonna find these guys.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.447
- Hi, how you doing?
- Good. How are you?

14:16.606 --> 14:18.859
- Good. Come in.
- Nice to see you.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.743
- Good to see you.
- How have you been?

14:20.902 --> 14:24.497
- Good. Come in and have a seat.
- Thanks, Margie.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.413
- Can I get you guys anything?
- We're fine. Thank you.

14:27.575 --> 14:31.125
- Okay, well, Mike'll be right out.
- Terrific.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.594
Really done well for himself.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.384
Yeah.

14:45.009 --> 14:49.355
He got good money
for that place in the town.

14:51.641 --> 14:54.315
Why does anybody move to Saugus?

14:55.186 --> 14:57.814
It's gonna take us an hour
to get over the Portagee Slide.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.527
Yep.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.408
Jesus.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.326
This shit with the Florist
is getting old, man.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.491
I'm investing in a marquee score.

15:08.658 --> 15:11.002
All right? So we gotta
make a few payments.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.037
Fuck making payments to him.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.956
Hey, let me give you some advice.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.501
Money don't care where it came from,
all right?

15:17.667 --> 15:20.170
The guy's a fucking
Lucky Charms Irishman...

15:20.336 --> 15:22.680
who can't find no one
to sell his AKs to...

15:22.839 --> 15:25.342
so he's selling narcotics,
trying to be the boss.

15:25.508 --> 15:28.512
You didn't seem to care
when you were dropping 2 grand a week...

15:28.678 --> 15:30.351
on monsters and yay, did you?

15:30.513 --> 15:34.859
Look, there's a difference between
a dealer and a straight killer, all right?

15:35.017 --> 15:38.271
So he dropped a few Dominicans.
What, are you picky?

15:39.021 --> 15:40.147
Hey, guys.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.191
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey, Mike.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.619
- Here you go, guys.
- Hey.

15:45.778 --> 15:46.904
Here you go.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.368
-Hundred G's?
-That's right.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.370
Look at this.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.127
- Like a newborn baby. All right.
- That's it.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.880
- Take care, guys.
- All right. Good to see you, Mike.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.881
- Looking good.
- All right.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.094
- Hundred pounds.
- Hundred grand.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.343
There you go.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.382
- Green money.
- All right.

16:06.716 --> 16:10.391
- Be smart, brother. We'll see you.
- Thanks. Thank you.

16:16.559 --> 16:19.654
- Hey, Rusty. How you doing?
- Hey, Jem. What's up? How are you?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.485
Fergie. Kid's here.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.359
Hey, Fergie.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.696
- Here you go.
- How's it going, son?

16:28.863 --> 16:32.242
All right. You run that under the sink,
all right?

16:32.950 --> 16:34.497
Trust me.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.381
All right. Good to see you.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.762
Take it easy, man. 
Good to see you.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.853
Now it's time for the fun part.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.619
What's going on, pal?

17:54.782 --> 17:55.874
What up?

17:56.033 --> 17:57.376
Hey, there he is.

17:57.535 --> 17:58.752
- Boom.
- Sober Jackson.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.879
- What's up?
- Hey, hey. Krista's here.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.591
Go on, tell the story.

18:03.749 --> 18:07.174
Dougy, sit down. I'm trying to tell
these motherfuckers about your father.

18:07.336 --> 18:10.180
The feds will never understand
the guy who's facing 40 years.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.843
Gonna give him the opportunity to walk soot-free 
if he gives up his friends.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.104
He tells them,
"Suck a dick. Give me the 40."

18:16.262 --> 18:17.354
"Fucking suck a dick."

18:18.222 --> 18:20.566
Yeah, well, here's to Big Mac.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.731
Doing his time like a man.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.863
- That's right.
- Last crew in Charlestown.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.524
I'm gonna get a tonic, I guess.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.658
All right.
Get me an umbrella for my beer.

18:29.817 --> 18:33.287
Let me get a Shirley Temple
with an extra cherry, please.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.616
Poor fucking sober bastard.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.542
- Thanks.
- No problem.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.087
Juice?

18:49.253 --> 18:51.506
Yeah. Juice.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.971
Do you want some snappers
to go with that?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.761
- What are you doing?
- I was just playing.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.725
Fuck.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.728
My drink.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.069
Heard you got in a fight, Kris.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.905
Do I look like I got in a fight?

19:12.568 --> 19:15.196
I don't know. Let me see.
They pull your hoop out?

19:15.363 --> 19:16.410
That's right.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.454
The Jamaican started it.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.999
"The Jamaican started it."
What Jamaican?

19:22.161 --> 19:25.256
Fucking Somalian started talking shit
when I was with my daughter.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.883
You were with Shyne?

19:28.668 --> 19:32.263
Tonya was with us. 
And Cheryl too.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.265
- The other girl was by herself?
- Yeah.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.552
All they see are yuppies down here.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.688
They think there's no more serious
white people in Charlestown.

19:40.888 --> 19:43.767
So they can fucking talk shit? No.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.935
You didn't say nothing to her first?

19:46.686 --> 19:49.439
I said something after I slapped 
the black off her face.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.233
- Right, yeah.
- Fuck.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.908
Well, do you miss it?

19:56.070 --> 19:58.744
Fucking coke and Oxy and all that shit? 
Yeah, I miss it.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.828
You know what I miss?

20:01.325 --> 20:05.171
The fucking grip I used to get
on your armrest.

20:07.331 --> 20:10.380
We smoked it to the filter, right?

20:10.793 --> 20:12.466
- So have one beer.
- Jimmy.

20:12.628 --> 20:16.098
- One beer ain't gonna kill you, right?
- Drink my beer for me real quick.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.180
- And one for me.
- One for you? Yeah.

20:30.104 --> 20:31.151
Dougy.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.074
Dougy.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.200
Doug.

20:39.655 --> 20:43.330
Motherfucker, I know you can hear me.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.287
You know I got a key, Dougy.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.263
Come on in.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.175
Too fucking busy, huh?

21:06.015 --> 21:08.063
Come on, Dougy.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.686
What's up, Kris?

21:31.123 --> 21:34.593
There you go.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.137
That's what you want, right?

21:37.630 --> 21:40.383
- Yeah.
- Is that what you want?

21:41.717 --> 21:43.560
Say you love it.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.395
Good night.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.422
<i>I'm grateful to be here today.</i>

22:19.630 --> 22:22.304
<i>I started out with alcohol,
and, you know, right away...</i>

22:22.466 --> 22:26.312
<i>went to cocaine and smoking crack.</i>

22:26.470 --> 22:30.270
<i>Growing up in Charlestown in,
you know, a small-knit community...</i>

22:30.432 --> 22:32.526
<i>we took care of each other.
We were protected.</i>

22:32.685 --> 22:34.608
<i>My friends were really
like my family.</i>

22:34.770 --> 22:36.989
<i>I'm ashamed of the things I done
when I'm out there.</i>

22:37.147 --> 22:39.275
<i>I don't know
where I learned these things.</i>

22:39.441 --> 22:42.615
<i>Seven years went by,
and I'd watch Christmas, birthdays--</i>

22:42.778 --> 22:44.530
<i>I didn't know what my son looked like.</i>

22:44.697 --> 22:46.699
<i>Make a fast buck if we had to...</i>

22:46.866 --> 22:51.212
<i>that progressed into getting arrested, and...</i>

22:51.370 --> 22:55.091
<i>The struggle that you have within yourself,
the loss, you know what I mean?</i>

22:55.249 --> 22:59.299
<i>The disappointment in yourself. The anger
that turns into disappointment. The despair.</i>

22:59.461 --> 23:02.305
<i>It's like the guy sitting in the bar,
and a priest walks in.</i>

23:02.464 --> 23:04.011
The guy says, 
"Hey, wait a minute.

23:04.174 --> 23:08.395
I hate to tell you this, don't waste your time, 
but I happen to know there's no God."

23:08.554 --> 23:10.227
The priest says, 
"Yeah, how's that?"

23:10.389 --> 23:13.734
The guy says,
"I was an explorer in the North Pole.

23:13.893 --> 23:17.318
I got caught in a blinding storm once.
Freezing. I was blinded.

23:17.479 --> 23:21.109
Freezing to death. And I prayed,
'If there's a God, save me now.'

23:21.275 --> 23:22.777
Now, God didn't come."

23:22.943 --> 23:26.664
And the priest says, you know, "How's that? 
You're alive. He must've saved you."

23:26.822 --> 23:28.324
He says, 
"God never showed up.

23:28.490 --> 23:32.495
An Eskimo came along,
Took me back to his camp and saved me."

23:32.661 --> 23:35.710
That's Janice. She's my wife
and she's sitting right there,

23:36.498 --> 23:38.796
She's my Eskimo.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.058
- How you doing?
- Hey.

25:02.918 --> 25:03.919
Excuse me?

25:04.670 --> 25:06.343
Are you doing laundry?

25:07.548 --> 25:08.970
Huh?

25:09.258 --> 25:11.932
I just wondered if you had any change.
The machine is out.

25:13.721 --> 25:15.894
- Can't help you. Sorry.
- Okay.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.772
I can just hang them up
when I get home.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.384
You all right?

25:52.384 --> 25:54.227
I'm fine. I'm just--

25:54.386 --> 25:56.013
Are you sure?

26:00.434 --> 26:01.481
You okay?

26:02.061 --> 26:05.531
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, thank you.
I'm fine, yeah.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.441
Well, this is embarrassing.

26:07.608 --> 26:10.077
No, you got nothing
to be embarrassed for.

26:11.862 --> 26:13.864
Do you need help?

26:14.448 --> 26:16.542
I'm just having a bad week.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.500
I understand.

26:21.789 --> 26:24.042
I like to have a good cry
at the nail salon.

26:26.502 --> 26:30.723
Just open right up to the ladies.
They're very understanding.

26:30.881 --> 26:34.010
But, you know,
you like the Laundromat, so that's fine.

26:40.641 --> 26:44.487
Hey, why don't you let me
buy you a drink.

26:44.645 --> 26:47.114
Make up for letting you down
with the quarters.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.866
You know, see if we can turn
your week around.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.699
What's the worst that could happen?

26:52.861 --> 26:54.158
<i>FBI! Open the door!</i>

26:54.488 --> 26:55.740
Open the door!

26:58.367 --> 26:59.710
Fuck.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.046
Fuck.

27:07.209 --> 27:09.211
Fucking cocksucker. 
Get off him.

27:22.558 --> 27:23.901
Jesus Christ, Henry.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.771
Oxy, guns?

27:27.563 --> 27:29.190
It's like townie Christmas.

27:32.151 --> 27:35.781
Minimum federal sentencing,
10 years.

27:38.574 --> 27:39.826
You're gonna need a friend.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.753
And she ain't it.

27:44.872 --> 27:48.422
Great girl, though.
She really loves you, I can tell.

27:49.334 --> 27:52.554
Good news for you is you have an alibi
for the Cambridge job.

27:52.713 --> 27:56.468
The good news for me
is I bet you know something about it.

27:57.718 --> 27:59.937
Everyone does trucks.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.849
These guys beat the alarm
for the vault.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.066
- Yeah?
- It's what I heard.

28:05.225 --> 28:08.946
A kid, he gets into the junction box.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.948
- This is nice.
- Yeah, it's a good place.

28:20.115 --> 28:23.460
A guy I played hockey with for a long time
is one of the managers here.

28:23.619 --> 28:26.463
Oh, yeah? That's nice.

28:27.456 --> 28:29.174
So, what do you do for work?

28:31.126 --> 28:32.423
Boston Sand and Gravel.

28:32.586 --> 28:35.590
I break rocks.
Punch a ticket at the end of the day...

28:35.756 --> 28:38.635
slide down the back of a brontosaurus
like Fred Flintstone.

28:38.800 --> 28:39.892
Call it a night.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.143
- Can I ask you something?
- You sure can.

28:43.305 --> 28:45.774
I volunteer at the Boys & Girls Club
in Charlestown--

28:45.933 --> 28:47.105
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

28:47.267 --> 28:51.192
As a kickball pitcher since they haven't
been able to afford any ice for the rink.

28:51.355 --> 28:54.029
Embarrassing, City won't put
any money into that place.

28:54.191 --> 28:57.991
Yeah, I know. Yeah, well, some of the kids
were calling me a toonie.

28:58.528 --> 29:02.158
It just means a yuppie. Someone who's not 
from Charlestown, that's all.

29:02.324 --> 29:05.498
- Of course it does.
- They're just being punks.

29:05.661 --> 29:06.708
- A yuppie.
- Yeah.

29:06.870 --> 29:10.215
- So where does the word come from?
- Uh...

29:10.499 --> 29:12.376
It comes from back in the '90s, like...

29:12.542 --> 29:15.136
the toonies supplied all the tunes
to Charlestown...

29:15.295 --> 29:19.175
because once they moved in
the townies stole all their car stereos.

29:19.341 --> 29:21.719
So all of a sudden,
everyone in Charlestown...

29:21.885 --> 29:25.185
had a Blaupunkt in their car,
you know what I mean?

29:25.847 --> 29:26.894
Anyway.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.478
So do your parents still live
in Charlestown?

29:30.852 --> 29:33.480
No. My mother moved away.

29:33.647 --> 29:37.527
My father lives out in the suburbs.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.531
Yeah. He don't get out much.

29:42.114 --> 29:45.084
- No, I mean where did you grow up?
- Marblehead.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.044
Marblehead?

29:48.370 --> 29:49.542
Wow.

29:49.705 --> 29:52.128
Yeah, well,
I represent Marblehead's poor.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.669
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, you were defined by...

29:54.835 --> 29:59.887
whether or not your family owned a boat.
And, well, my family didn't own a boat.

30:00.048 --> 30:03.643
No boat. How could you
look yourself in the mirror?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.475
It's embarrassing.

30:07.389 --> 30:08.641
- I have a boat.
- Oh, yeah?

30:08.807 --> 30:11.401
- Yeah.
- Well, you would do well in Marblehead.

30:11.560 --> 30:15.235
Yeah, maybe. it's not my boat,
it's my friend's boat.

30:15.939 --> 30:17.612
You should...

30:17.774 --> 30:20.368
let me take you for a ride sometime.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.831
- I'd love that. Sometime.
- Yeah.

30:24.990 --> 30:28.494
What about right now?

30:38.920 --> 30:42.515
That's the boat. 
Right there.

30:45.052 --> 30:46.554
Wow.

30:47.763 --> 30:50.437
- Not bad, right?
- Good friends to have.

31:10.452 --> 31:13.331
Here you go.
It's the best cup I could find.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.333
Not too much.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.173
Thank you.

31:21.004 --> 31:23.803
It's nice, right? 
I told you.

31:23.965 --> 31:26.309
Is this where you take all the girls?

31:27.636 --> 31:31.482
I can honestly tell you I have never taken
another girl here in my entire life.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.234
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm. That's the truth.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.820
Hey, what do you know about
bank robbers?

31:44.319 --> 31:46.822
- What's to know?
- You're from Charlestown.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.082
I figured you grew up 
with some of them.

31:49.533 --> 31:51.877
No, not really. I mean...

31:52.244 --> 31:55.669
A lot of what they say is exaggerated.
I mean, I--

31:57.499 --> 31:59.467
When I was a kid, uh...

32:00.919 --> 32:03.422
we used to go to Wizard's ice cream.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.841
It was across from J.J.'s Bar.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.806
That was where all the big
armored-car guys hung out.

32:08.969 --> 32:12.314
And they were like rock stars
in the neighborhood, you know?

32:12.472 --> 32:15.646
Fancy cars. Pretty girls.

32:15.809 --> 32:21.407
And you heard rumors
about the jobs they pulled.

32:21.565 --> 32:25.866
The big houses they had
in Holbrook or Winthrop.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.914
There was a lot of kids
in the ice-cream shop...

32:30.073 --> 32:33.668
with their noses pressed
against the glass, you know...

32:34.578 --> 32:37.422
who wanted to be like those guys.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.881
I just wanted to play hockey.

32:46.423 --> 32:49.518
Anyway, that's what I know
about bank robbers.

32:55.223 --> 32:59.148
- Hey, Jem. How's it going?
- Hey, B. Can I have a beer? Thanks.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.403
- Oh, shit.
- What up?

33:00.562 --> 33:04.032
- How you doing?
- All right. Sox got rocked.

33:06.651 --> 33:08.244
What's going on?

33:11.740 --> 33:13.788
You, uh, check on that thing?

33:13.950 --> 33:15.076
What?

33:15.243 --> 33:17.371
The license.

33:18.538 --> 33:21.382
- Yeah.
- And?

33:21.541 --> 33:24.590
Nothing. It's a dead end. 
We're all set.

33:25.378 --> 33:28.006
So no need to remove her
from the equation?

33:28.590 --> 33:31.594
- What?
- You heard me.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.809
What are you, a triggerman now?

33:35.222 --> 33:37.099
Just loose ends, kid.

33:38.683 --> 33:42.278
You're gonna get the fucking electric chair 
brought back over to Charlestown.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.781
Don't be so goddamned panicked,
all right, Dig Dug?

33:44.940 --> 33:48.114
Just, you know, I don't wanna get
backdoored, that's all.

33:48.276 --> 33:51.155
- We're fine. All right?
- All right. We're fine.

33:51.321 --> 33:53.619
- Okay.
- We're fine.

33:56.117 --> 33:58.211
They obviously know
how to work the box.

33:58.370 --> 34:02.420
But I like the way they zapped the BPT
to the D-5 station.

34:02.582 --> 34:04.710
How does one learn how to do that?

34:06.002 --> 34:07.925
Get a job at Vericom.

34:08.088 --> 34:10.716
- Okay.
- Thank you.

34:12.132 --> 34:14.601
All right, let's subpoena work logs,
employee records.

34:14.761 --> 34:16.763
Start with everybody
who lives in the town.

34:16.929 --> 34:18.351
Got it.

34:22.851 --> 34:26.527
Ms. Keesey, it's Agent Frawley.
I have follow-up questions about your case.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.784
Is there somewhere we can meet?

34:29.693 --> 34:32.286
Why didn't you tell me
you lived in Charlestown?

34:32.445 --> 34:33.661
It's on my paperwork.

34:40.954 --> 34:42.331
You don't like your sandwich?

34:43.206 --> 34:47.177
It's the unfortunate nagging suspicion
you get as an FBI agent..

34:47.335 --> 34:50.554
who has put a lot of neighborhood people 
in federal prison...

34:50.714 --> 34:54.389
that someone may have
violated your meal.

34:54.551 --> 34:57.020
Come on, I don't think
anyone would do that.

34:57.178 --> 35:00.398
They throw Tom Fitz off the roof
of Mishawum for cooperating...

35:00.557 --> 35:04.061
and then stand around and taunt him
while he drowned in his own blood.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.022
So I don't think the lunch special
is out of bounds.

35:07.188 --> 35:09.156
Okay.

35:09.899 --> 35:12.322
They lionize criminals...

35:12.485 --> 35:14.533
and complain about crime...

35:14.696 --> 35:16.198
and I'm the bad guy.

35:17.324 --> 35:20.828
This place is one square mile.

35:20.994 --> 35:24.464
You walk into Lewisburg,
there's a hundred townies in there.

35:24.998 --> 35:26.875
Well, I think I'll skip Lewisburg.

35:28.043 --> 35:30.262
Doesn't sound like a fun second date?

35:33.590 --> 35:36.013
If I ask a question,
will you give an honest answer?

35:36.509 --> 35:38.227
It depends on the question.

35:39.054 --> 35:40.647
Am I a suspect?

35:41.473 --> 35:43.896
Would I ask you out
if I thought you were a suspect?

35:44.059 --> 35:45.902
I don't know.

35:46.770 --> 35:49.068
- Would you?
- Not if I wanted a conviction.

35:55.654 --> 35:58.032
I might be seeing someone already.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.455
- What? What is it?
- Stickup.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.798
Chelsea Credit Union.

36:06.956 --> 36:09.050
What would we do without Chelsea?

36:12.545 --> 36:14.343
Anyway, aren't there rules?

36:14.923 --> 36:17.096
Against dating the Vic?
Yeah, there's a rule.

36:17.258 --> 36:18.931
You don't do it.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.359
- There she is.
- Hey.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.021
- All set?
- Yes.

36:31.731 --> 36:34.029
I should have come
get your door for you, huh?

36:34.192 --> 36:37.116
What kind of a guy lets you open
your own door like that?

36:39.447 --> 36:40.699
What?

36:41.658 --> 36:43.535
I have to get something out there...

36:43.702 --> 36:47.172
otherwise I'll be pretending
to listen to you all night...

36:47.330 --> 36:49.833
when really I'm thinking about
something else.

36:51.251 --> 36:52.298
Okay.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.469
A few days ago my bank was robbed.

36:57.632 --> 37:01.182
Four men took it over
and opened the safe.

37:01.594 --> 37:04.643
They took me as a hostage.

37:06.266 --> 37:09.065
They blindfolded me
and drove me around.

37:11.271 --> 37:14.366
And then they stopped and let me out
over at the beach and...

37:15.650 --> 37:19.029
And one of the guys told me...

37:19.279 --> 37:23.000
to walk until I felt the water
on my toes.

37:24.409 --> 37:28.289
It was the longest walk of my life.
I kept thinking I'd step off a cliff.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.928
And then I felt the water.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.674
I'm sorry.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.598
It's not your fault.

37:44.554 --> 37:48.684
Anyway, the FBI guy told me
it would feel like I was in mourning.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.979
FBI? You're working with the FBI?

37:52.145 --> 37:53.567
Mm-hm.

37:54.314 --> 37:56.237
What does that mean?

37:56.483 --> 37:59.737
Guy comes by, checks in on you,
gives you a call? That kind of thing?

38:00.361 --> 38:01.908
Pretty much.

38:02.655 --> 38:06.285
They don't have any suspects?
Any clues? Any leads? Anything like that?

38:06.701 --> 38:09.045
I don't know.
Not that they've told me.

38:09.204 --> 38:12.048
He intimated that they were
scouring Charlestown...

38:13.374 --> 38:16.719
but they were wearing masks, so...

38:17.337 --> 38:19.715
- Shit.
- Mm.

38:21.216 --> 38:24.516
I'm sure I'd recognize their voices
if I heard them again.

38:25.220 --> 38:28.895
I don't know,
might be harder than you think.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.859
At least you weren't hurt.

38:33.895 --> 38:35.363
No.

38:35.939 --> 38:37.566
No, but David was.

38:37.732 --> 38:41.862
My assistant manager, he was assaulted
really badly when the alarm went off.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.656
He's been at Mass Eye and Ear
for a week.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.416
Eye surgery.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.665
And I still haven't been able
to go see him.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.839
I feel like a terrible person.

38:53.832 --> 38:57.177
Then I guess we know
where we're going.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.274
Well, you should come in.

39:12.976 --> 39:15.320
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you should meet him.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.359
All right.

39:18.147 --> 39:19.774
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi.

39:19.941 --> 39:22.820
Oh, hi. Come to my good side.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.579
- Hi.
- Look. You don't look so bad.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.490
- Really?
- Well, you know.

39:27.657 --> 39:28.954
- Hello.
- Hey.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.836
- This is my friend Doug.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.872
Nice to meet you. 
I can almost see you.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.381
So...

39:35.623 --> 39:36.795
they're hopeful.

39:36.958 --> 39:39.632
Well, "hopeful" means I may recover...

39:39.794 --> 39:42.172
50 percent of my sight in this eye.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.133
Oh, I just want to get back to work.

39:45.300 --> 39:48.474
I'm gonna give you guys some privacy.
I'll be right outside.

39:53.641 --> 39:55.894
- You heard what happened?
- Huh?

39:56.311 --> 39:58.564
Big takedown robbery.

39:58.813 --> 40:02.192
- Fucking punks laid the guy out.
- Oh, yeah?

40:04.319 --> 40:06.413
It's a good thing you're here.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.078
Those guys could come back.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.334
Yeah.

40:11.534 --> 40:13.957
<i>I lied to the FBI.</i>

40:14.162 --> 40:15.709
<i>What?</i>

40:16.080 --> 40:17.582
When the guy attacked David...

40:17.749 --> 40:20.343
I could see the back of his neck
and he had a tattoo.

40:22.670 --> 40:23.842
Of what?

40:24.297 --> 40:27.471
It was one of those
Fighting Irish tattoos.

40:27.634 --> 40:30.183
I'm afraid if I report it
they'll make me testify.

40:30.345 --> 40:32.689
What do you think I should do?

40:36.184 --> 40:38.357
Tell the FBI.

40:38.853 --> 40:42.699
If the guy's got a record,
and I'm sure he does...

40:42.857 --> 40:45.485
they'll have his tattoos on file.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.950
They'll ring him up the next day.

40:48.112 --> 40:51.116
Robbery, weapons. 
He'll get 30 years.

40:51.282 --> 40:54.832
Course, they'll worry someone's
gonna come looking for the witness.

40:55.119 --> 40:58.874
The FBI will probably want to put you 
in WITSEC, you know, Witness Security.

40:59.040 --> 41:03.090
You know, they'll probably put you somewhere,
like, you know, in Cleveland...

41:03.252 --> 41:05.471
or Arizona, you know,
somewhere safe.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.137
Or...

41:09.467 --> 41:11.265
you could wait.

41:13.221 --> 41:15.223
You have a card.

41:16.057 --> 41:18.401
There's nothing says you gotta 
play it right away.

41:18.559 --> 41:21.688
You're the one who's vulnerable
in this situation right now.

41:22.146 --> 41:24.695
The FBI are just people
like anyone else.

41:24.857 --> 41:27.861
They wanna find the bad guy so they
can go home and nuke their supper.

41:28.027 --> 41:31.076
You have to look out
for yourself, Claire.

41:33.074 --> 41:34.701
Quite an expert.

41:36.703 --> 41:38.250
Not really.

41:39.789 --> 41:41.086
Just watch a lot of TV.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.968
I watch a lot of <i>CSI.</i>

41:44.127 --> 41:47.131
So I'm a really big expert
on all this. I know.

41:47.296 --> 41:50.721
And <i>Miami CSI</i> 
and <i>New York CSI.</i>

41:50.883 --> 41:52.760
All of them, I watch.

41:52.927 --> 41:54.270
You'll be well-prepared.

41:54.429 --> 41:55.806
And <i>Bones.</i>

41:59.183 --> 42:04.986
Do we know each other well enough for me 
to say that this truck is a little much?

42:05.148 --> 42:06.274
It's my work truck.

42:06.441 --> 42:09.615
If you have problems with your Prius
I can throw it in the back.

42:09.777 --> 42:11.779
How did you know I had a Prius?

42:14.407 --> 42:17.786
Took a guess.
I mean, it just seemed like a toonie car.

42:17.952 --> 42:19.795
- Why, do you really have a Prius?
- Yeah.

42:19.954 --> 42:22.332
- Really?
- I had a Prius.

42:22.498 --> 42:25.502
- It got vandalized, of course.
- What happened?

42:25.668 --> 42:29.047
Doesn't matter. Now I'm forced to walk
a mile through the projects.

42:29.213 --> 42:32.592
- There were these guys and they started...
- What?

42:32.759 --> 42:35.638
I'm not sure if it was the same guys
who trashed my car, but--

42:35.803 --> 42:39.307
They started getting, you know--
It started with yelling when I walked by...

42:39.474 --> 42:41.693
and then it got
really aggressive and...

42:41.851 --> 42:43.068
What were they doing?

42:43.227 --> 42:45.400
Once glass bottles
started getting thrown...

42:45.563 --> 42:49.488
I started coming to terms with not being
cool enough to walk through the projects.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.493
They threw bottles at you?

42:51.652 --> 42:55.247
I'm fine. I just have to, you know,
go the long way.

42:55.656 --> 42:57.579
That's all. It doesn't matter.

42:57.742 --> 43:00.291
No. You just have to live with it,
I guess.

43:01.245 --> 43:03.373
You remember what they look like?

43:08.753 --> 43:11.006
I need your help.
I can't tell you what it is...

43:11.172 --> 43:14.722
you can never ask me about it later,
and we're gonna hurt some people.

43:16.844 --> 43:18.687
Whose car are we gonna take?

43:25.895 --> 43:27.363
Kenny with the white nose.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.905
- Hey, what's good, man?
- Hey.

43:32.068 --> 43:34.662
- How you doing?
- I hope you here to buy something.

43:34.821 --> 43:37.700
You roll up on a nigga,
"Kenny with the white nose" like that.

43:37.865 --> 43:39.867
Well, we ain't here to play fucking Xbox.

43:40.034 --> 43:42.708
- Yeah.
- Wanna buy some dope, Kenny.

43:42.870 --> 43:44.838
- Cheap, shitty dope.
- Yeah? Okay.

43:44.997 --> 43:47.216
- He sells no other kind.
- Let me go find my box.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.753
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Appreciate it.

43:52.380 --> 43:53.927
Kenny.

43:55.383 --> 43:56.555
We're in Charlestown.

43:57.260 --> 44:01.060
Worst heroin problem on the East Coast.
Nigga Ken can't find his box.

44:02.140 --> 44:04.017
You ever buy from this clown before?

44:04.183 --> 44:07.858
I bought drugs from electrician Marty 
with the white nose.

44:08.020 --> 44:09.067
All right.

44:11.357 --> 44:15.328
Yeah, here we go.
I got just what you need, brother.

44:15.820 --> 44:18.573
- All right, here.
- All right. Looks good to me, baby.

44:18.739 --> 44:20.412
- Thanks, partner.
- Yes, sir.

44:20.908 --> 44:22.581
Hey, um...

44:22.869 --> 44:26.464
you know them Dominican kids
always starting trouble on Medford Street?

44:26.622 --> 44:27.874
Know what unit they're in?

44:41.846 --> 44:44.144
Townie credit card.

45:06.996 --> 45:09.465
- Who is it?
- Open up.

45:14.587 --> 45:16.555
What the--?

45:26.891 --> 45:28.985
You drinking beers up here, huh? You--

45:36.108 --> 45:38.486
That hurts, right? 
Fucking piece of shit.

45:39.487 --> 45:40.955
Huh?

45:43.366 --> 45:45.289
Throw with your left?

45:49.830 --> 45:51.582
- Fuck!
- Oh, shit, that hurts, huh?

45:51.749 --> 45:54.172
- What the fuck?
- That's a bitch, ain't it?

45:56.379 --> 46:00.680
Deal gone south for you motherfuckers.

46:00.841 --> 46:02.559
- Too bad.
- Who the fuck are you?

46:02.927 --> 46:07.182
Shouldn't be up here
fucking selling dope, I guess.

46:07.723 --> 46:10.226
Listen to me,
we're coming back in a week.

46:11.352 --> 46:13.650
- If you're fucking here then...
- Oh, shit.

46:13.813 --> 46:15.941
this is happening again.

46:18.067 --> 46:20.115
Let's go, we're done.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.288
Hey.

46:23.739 --> 46:26.538
- What'd you do?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

46:26.701 --> 46:28.669
That's my brother.
What'd you do to him?

46:28.828 --> 46:30.671
I don't know what you're talking about.

46:30.830 --> 46:33.049
- You don't know? How about now?
- No.

46:33.207 --> 46:35.505
Hey, chill, chill, chill, man. 
Chill. Chill, man.

46:35.668 --> 46:37.045
Don't tell me to chill.

46:37.211 --> 46:38.838
- Enough. Let's go.
- What'd you do?

46:39.005 --> 46:40.882
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No?

46:42.550 --> 46:46.145
Soccer. 
There goes college soccer, motherfucker.

46:46.304 --> 46:48.773
- Fuck!
- What'd you do?

46:48.931 --> 46:51.104
- No?
- I don't know. Aah!

46:52.059 --> 46:53.527
See my face?

46:53.978 --> 46:55.901
Go tell the cops, all right?

46:56.063 --> 46:59.067
But just remember, I seen yours too.

46:59.233 --> 47:01.076
Fuck.

47:12.538 --> 47:15.462
I can't be up there
killing people, man.

47:16.042 --> 47:18.090
Hey, you brought me.

47:28.554 --> 47:29.601
<i>Desmond Elden?</i>

47:29.764 --> 47:32.643
Yeah, works for Vericom.
Never seen the inside of a jail cell.

47:32.808 --> 47:35.482
Most of these guys got no-show jobs.
Take down a truck...

47:35.644 --> 47:39.194
foreman goes, "Yeah, guy was here yesterday."
He shows us a forged timecard.

47:39.357 --> 47:42.281
Can't play them games at Vericom
because it's a public company.

47:42.443 --> 47:44.445
You don't show up,
it's a recorded sick day.

47:44.612 --> 47:47.240
And Dezzy here,
he's got some interesting sick days.

47:47.406 --> 47:53.504
BankBoston, Cummins Armored,
Arlington Brinks, Cambridge Merchants.

48:00.002 --> 48:01.970
Jesus Christ.

48:05.174 --> 48:08.098
So do your parents
still live in Charlestown?

48:08.260 --> 48:12.640
No, my father finally
made it out to the suburbs,

48:13.099 --> 48:14.692
What about your mother?

48:15.142 --> 48:18.066
I couldn't tell you.
She left when I was 6.

48:21.315 --> 48:22.817
What happened?

48:23.901 --> 48:25.744
She left.

48:32.284 --> 48:33.661
Okay.

48:42.002 --> 48:43.675
Okay.

48:45.005 --> 48:47.349
This sound woke me up.

48:49.468 --> 48:51.937
At first I didn't know what it was.

48:53.055 --> 48:56.104
Sounded like an animal
that got trapped.

48:58.519 --> 49:01.363
I never heard a man cry before.

49:03.315 --> 49:06.114
I came downstairs in my underwear.

49:07.278 --> 49:09.872
I see my father in the kitchen.

49:10.364 --> 49:12.617
First thing I remember was the ashtray.

49:12.783 --> 49:15.252
Must have been a hundred cigarettes
in there.

49:15.411 --> 49:17.914
Ash like a little mountain.

49:19.206 --> 49:21.334
He stopped crying...

49:21.709 --> 49:25.088
was just sitting there watching TV
on a little black-and-white.

49:25.254 --> 49:26.927
No sound.

49:29.258 --> 49:31.932
I think he just didn't know
what else to do.

49:34.680 --> 49:38.560
He looked at me standing there
in the doorway in my Underoos.

49:41.103 --> 49:45.233
He said, "Your mother left.
She's not coming back."

49:47.902 --> 49:49.745
Just like that.

49:51.405 --> 49:55.706
Smoking cigarettes and eating
a TV dinner at 6 in the morning.

49:59.079 --> 50:02.253
We lost our dog the year before...

50:04.793 --> 50:07.512
and I wanted to make these posters...

50:08.672 --> 50:11.391
in case my mother was lost...

50:11.550 --> 50:13.393
someone could call us...

50:13.552 --> 50:16.226
like the guy who found our dog.

50:18.599 --> 50:22.354
To this day my father will tell you 
he helped me make them posters, but he didn't.

50:22.520 --> 50:26.400
Sat in the kitchen, drank a case of beer
while I went out on School Street...

50:26.565 --> 50:29.284
asking people
if they'd seen my mother.

50:29.818 --> 50:31.616
Her name was Doris.

50:31.779 --> 50:36.956
My grandmother had a place
that's a restaurant in Tangerine, Florida.

50:37.117 --> 50:39.996
So I used to imagine
maybe that's where she went.

50:41.205 --> 50:46.962
Then I came to terms with the fact
that doesn't really matter, you know?

50:47.211 --> 50:51.717
Wherever she went,
she had a good reason to leave here.

50:52.841 --> 50:55.685
She didn't wanna be
my mother anymore...

50:56.178 --> 51:00.354
and she wasn't coming back.

51:02.935 --> 51:06.314
And now you know a little bit
about my family...

51:06.814 --> 51:09.192
but I'm still not showing you
my apartment.

51:10.818 --> 51:13.162
How bad can it be?

51:23.497 --> 51:25.920
Oh, yeah.

51:41.181 --> 51:42.398
<i>Desmond Elden.</i>

51:42.558 --> 51:46.279
<i>Systems tech at Vericom,
22 years old.</i>

51:46.895 --> 51:50.195
Albert Magloan. Only in Boston
is a guy named Albert Magloan.

51:50.357 --> 51:53.702
Mr. Magloan never met a car
he couldn't boost.

51:54.111 --> 51:55.704
The kind of talented individual...

51:55.863 --> 51:59.618
<i>that can start your Cherokee for you
while you're still looking for your keys.</i>

51:59.783 --> 52:03.913
<i>James Coughlin. Father was killed
in prison, mother died of HIV.</i> 

52:04.079 --> 52:07.583
<i>Shot Brendan Leahey by the cemetery
behind Mishawum when he was 18.</i>

52:07.750 --> 52:11.755
<i>Pled it out. When the judge asked him 
why he did it, he said, "I didn't like the kid."</i>

52:11.920 --> 52:14.014
<i>Served nine years for manslaughter.</i>

52:14.173 --> 52:17.894
These guys plan and execute
with sophistication and discipline.

52:18.052 --> 52:20.555
And that is not our boy Coughlin.

52:20.971 --> 52:25.226
We think the architect is this guy,
Coughlin's best friend, Doug MacRay.

52:25.392 --> 52:27.736
Lives in the same house,
dated Coughlin's sister...

52:27.895 --> 52:32.446
who most likely mules for the Florist,
who used to employ MacRay's father.

52:32.608 --> 52:34.986
You need a fucking Venn diagram
for these people.

52:35.903 --> 52:40.579
Mac Senior got life for the Nashua job,
which most of you should remember.

52:40.741 --> 52:42.835
<i>Hijacked a bread truck
up to New Hampshire...</i>

52:42.993 --> 52:45.291
<i>one of the guards saw his face...</i>

52:45.454 --> 52:48.128
<i>so they executed both of them
with their own weapons.</i>

52:48.290 --> 52:51.794
Big Mac's legacy is now no A car driver
is allowed to leave the cab...

52:51.960 --> 52:54.133
even if there's a gun
to his partner's head.

52:54.296 --> 52:57.425
MacRay did eight months
for going over the counter at a BayBank...

52:57.591 --> 52:59.593
with a nail gun
after he washed out from pro hockey.

52:59.760 --> 53:02.434
- Pro hockey?
- Yeah, he was a big deal for a minute.

53:02.596 --> 53:05.099
<i>Got drafted, went to camp,
and here's the shocker:</i>

53:05.265 --> 53:07.313
Started making trouble,
fighting with guys.

53:07.810 --> 53:10.780
- Don't they pay you to fight in hockey?
- No, not the guys on your own team.

53:12.314 --> 53:14.533
MacRay came home,
got into the family business.

53:14.900 --> 53:16.277
Same song, got into OxyContin.

53:16.777 --> 53:19.621
<i>Hockey ship sailed with the narcotics.</i>

53:19.780 --> 53:22.249
Now, we are a long way away
from a grand jury here.

53:22.408 --> 53:24.285
We'll never get 24-hour surveillance...

53:24.451 --> 53:27.045
unless one of these idiots 
converts to Islam.

53:27.204 --> 53:29.047
So we build the case.

53:29.289 --> 53:31.712
All right, let's get to work.

53:33.085 --> 53:35.429
So I've been telling all my friends
about you.

53:35.587 --> 53:37.635
- Oh, yeah? All good, I hope.
- Yeah.

53:38.674 --> 53:40.142
Eh.

53:40.300 --> 53:44.476
Oh, yeah.
They say they're overcome with jealousy.

53:44.638 --> 53:47.016
They can't believe your luck.

53:47.182 --> 53:51.813
You moved to Charlestown,
hooked up with a rock-breaking townie.

53:53.439 --> 53:54.861
No.

53:56.108 --> 53:58.987
They just think it's a rebound.

53:59.278 --> 54:00.996
A rebound from what, the robbery?

54:01.155 --> 54:02.657
I don't know.

54:02.823 --> 54:05.827
I feel estranged from them somehow.

54:07.911 --> 54:10.790
What? Why do you look like that?

54:12.666 --> 54:16.387
- My brother died on a day like this.
- When was this?

54:17.045 --> 54:20.140
He was little. 
He had lymphoma.

54:21.967 --> 54:25.892
So now on really sunny days
I always think of someone dying.

54:27.931 --> 54:30.275
That's wrong, isn't it?

54:31.477 --> 54:32.854
No.

54:33.520 --> 54:36.023
I'm sure he'd be glad
you're thinking about him.

54:38.859 --> 54:40.452
This is a good day.

54:40.611 --> 54:42.705
I'm having a good time.

54:42.863 --> 54:44.365
Good.

54:44.948 --> 54:47.451
Then you'll miss me while I'm gone.

55:02.883 --> 55:04.806
Money, bitch.

55:07.137 --> 55:08.434
Pop.

55:09.431 --> 55:12.605
What the fuck you doing here? Huh?

55:12.768 --> 55:14.395
- Nothing.
- Nothing? What's this?

55:14.561 --> 55:16.188
- Who are you here with, huh?
- No one.

55:16.355 --> 55:18.983
- Let's get out of here,
- You're telling me this is yours?

55:19.149 --> 55:20.822
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Fucking Hawaiian pizza?

55:20.984 --> 55:22.577
- Sit down.
- Let's hit the road.

55:22.736 --> 55:25.159
- I gotta go.
- Sit the fuck down. Just sit down.

55:37.292 --> 55:39.590
- Hi.
- Hi.

55:39.837 --> 55:41.760
- Hey.
- Claire.

55:41.922 --> 55:43.094
- I'm Jem.
- Jim?

55:43.257 --> 55:44.759
Jem. Jem. It's just Jem, yeah.

55:44.925 --> 55:46.768
I'm a friend of this loser right here.

55:46.927 --> 55:50.397
- Nice to meet you.
- Sit down, sit down, relax. All right?

55:58.063 --> 56:02.239
So I saw your fucking Avalanche
parked around the corner, so...

56:02.401 --> 56:03.527
The Avalanche?

56:03.694 --> 56:06.447
- Truck.
- Fucking truck. His work truck right there.

56:07.948 --> 56:10.451
- Dougy's quite the worker.
- Yeah.

56:10.617 --> 56:12.790
Have you two known each other
a long time or...?

56:12.953 --> 56:16.628
Since we were 6.
We're like brothers. Right?

56:17.416 --> 56:19.635
But he's never mentioned a word
about you.

56:19.793 --> 56:22.467
The secrets with this one, 
you know, huh?

56:26.466 --> 56:29.310
Did you say your name was 
Jim or Jem?

56:29.469 --> 56:32.769
It's Ji-- Je--
Well, it's both, actually.

56:32.931 --> 56:35.525
Teachers, when we were growing up,
used to always say:

56:35.684 --> 56:38.153
"Hey, you can have this one.
He's a real gem."

56:38.770 --> 56:40.647
So I guess it kind of stuck.

56:42.107 --> 56:44.485
Whatever. I don't know.

56:44.651 --> 56:46.779
So, what do you do
for yourself there, Claire?

56:46.945 --> 56:48.822
Oh, I work at a bank.
I'm a bank manager.

56:48.989 --> 56:51.583
You're a bank manager?
Sounds fun. What bank?

56:52.284 --> 56:54.878
Cambridge Merchants. 
Just over there.

56:55.037 --> 56:58.541
Cambridge Merchants. Wait, that's the one
that just got robbed, isn't it?

56:58.707 --> 57:00.459
It got robbed, yeah. 
It did, yeah.

57:00.626 --> 57:04.051
I read about that. 
It's crazy.

57:04.546 --> 57:06.219
So then how is it that you two met?

57:06.381 --> 57:07.507
Um...

57:08.300 --> 57:10.428
We met at a Laundromat.

57:11.553 --> 57:12.725
Okay.

57:12.888 --> 57:14.390
Love among the bleach, right?

57:14.556 --> 57:16.354
Hey, it happens more than you think.

57:21.396 --> 57:25.446
Hey, Claire, don't get too used
to your life of leisure here.

57:25.609 --> 57:28.738
Dougy here, he's a real workaholic,
you know.

57:28.904 --> 57:31.373
He's always taking his work home with him.

57:31.531 --> 57:33.033
Aren't you?

57:35.535 --> 57:37.378
- All right.
- All right, brother.

57:38.163 --> 57:40.086
Take care of yourself, all right?
Be good.

57:40.248 --> 57:42.376
I'll see you at home.
It was nice to meet you.

57:42.542 --> 57:43.885
You too.

57:49.716 --> 57:53.562
Well, I guess you haven't been telling
all your friends about me.

58:00.310 --> 58:03.029
Who you following, Jem?
Me or her?

58:03.188 --> 58:05.361
I told you, I made the Avalanche.

58:06.858 --> 58:09.077
Nothing to worry about.
It's all under control.

58:09.236 --> 58:11.204
Oh, so you're trying to get us jammed up?

58:11.363 --> 58:13.582
- Is that it?
- I'm trying to get you jammed up.

58:14.408 --> 58:16.877
Tell me you got a move here, Dougy.

58:17.035 --> 58:20.881
Because the only way I see it is 
you got sprung like a goddamn bear trap...

58:21.039 --> 58:25.169
on some toonie pussy who happens
to be the one goddamn person-- Fuck!

58:25.335 --> 58:28.464
The one person that can give us
to the fucking feds.

58:31.675 --> 58:34.599
Calm down, all right?

58:34.845 --> 58:37.143
Don't you think we need to be 
smart right now?

58:37.305 --> 58:39.353
- Smart?
- Yeah.

58:40.767 --> 58:43.065
Let's start fucking all the witnesses.
All right?

58:43.228 --> 58:47.449
Yeah, I'm blowing the assistant manager.
Am I smart now? Huh?

58:47.607 --> 58:51.862
And no, I didn't tell the other guys,
only because they'd flip the fuck out.

58:52.237 --> 58:54.490
And I want them fucking ready
for the next thing.

58:54.656 --> 58:56.784
I told you, 
the next fucking thing's not ready.

58:56.950 --> 58:58.122
Then make it ready.

58:58.285 --> 59:02.040
I don't like the guards
on the next thing, all right?

59:02.205 --> 59:04.503
One kid is like fucking G.I. Joe.

59:04.666 --> 59:08.967
He wears the vest on the outside, 
tucks his pants into his fucking combat boots.

59:09.129 --> 59:10.881
The truck's fucking waist-high.

59:11.048 --> 59:13.801
We'll find another truck
with a driver...

59:13.967 --> 59:16.811
who's a fucking fat kid
with his fucking shit untucked...

59:16.970 --> 59:20.065
- who don't think he's Special Forces.
- Yeah?

59:20.223 --> 59:23.147
All right, look, I know you're happy 
in Fuck City over there...

59:23.310 --> 59:26.063
but I waited nine years in Walpole
for you, motherfucker.

59:26.229 --> 59:28.448
Just nine years, that's all.

59:29.858 --> 59:31.735
I'm done waiting.

59:33.403 --> 59:36.498
This is the last one.
We're hitting pause after this.

59:37.199 --> 59:40.123
You hate prison
but you can't wait to get caught.

59:40.285 --> 59:43.755
We get pinched,
remember whose idea this was, okay?

59:44.998 --> 59:46.875
Be ready on Friday.

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:04.393
<i>Visitors, straight ahead.</i>

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:37.347
- Who you seeing?
- Stephen MacRay.

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:55.569
Twelve.

01:00:55.735 --> 01:00:58.409
- Right down there.
- Thanks, Lenny.

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:22.855
You all right? Every time I come up 
here now it's the red pajamas.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:25.061
You still getting in trouble, Dad?

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:29.273
Hey, you know how it is.
Can't take no shit.

01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:32.155
You're getting a little old
for that bullshit, aren't you?

01:01:32.314 --> 01:01:34.942
Fucking Southie kids.
They wanna run everything.

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:38.612
Listen, you put a year together of
good behavior and get your points down...

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:40.997
you get classed out
over to Norfolk, Dad.

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:44.160
No one's gonna bother you there.
Nobody fights, you know?

01:01:44.326 --> 01:01:47.125
They got fucking Ben & Jerry's
ice cream and shit.

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:51.508
Well, some things you gotta deal 
with yourself, you know?

01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:57.548
All right.

01:02:04.012 --> 01:02:08.563
I'm thinking about taking a trip.

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:11.895
- Going dark for a minute.
- Taking heat?

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:15.107
Nah, just making a change.

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:16.991
Yeah, don't tell me.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:18.493
"Making a change."

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:21.280
Either you got heat or you don't.

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:25.371
I heard a bread truck got dropped.

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:28.003
Oh, yeah? 
I didn't hear about it.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:30.163
Okay.

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:34.176
You got five minutes. 
Five minutes.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:36.841
Let me ask you something.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:39.006
In case I don't see you again.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:44.723
How come you never...?

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:47.855
How come you never looked for her?

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.560
Uh...

01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:53.650
Looked for who?

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:57.532
For Ma.

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:01.115
For my mother.
How come you never looked for her?

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:04.532
How come you never tried to call nobody
or look for her, or ask around?

01:03:04.698 --> 01:03:06.917
Look, when your mother left...

01:03:07.742 --> 01:03:12.373
you cried so hard you were throwing up.
All over the parlor.

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:16.801
So I told you if you looked around
you might find her.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.088
Just to give you an activity.

01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:22.508
I didn't think you'd carry it
like a fucking disease.

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:27.220
What, you wanna think
she was an angel?

01:03:27.554 --> 01:03:29.272
Go ahead.

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:32.317
But look out your front door.

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:35.194
How many 22-year-old girls
are out there...

01:03:35.353 --> 01:03:39.779
they're fucking around
with kids they don't want...

01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:44.242
and, you know,
no sense in their heads.

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:48.245
And your mother wasn't no different.

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:50.502
That's the hard truth.

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:54.964
I made my peace with it.
You make yours.

01:03:55.457 --> 01:04:00.088
I didn't look for her
because there was nothing to find.

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:13.104
Look, I gotta die five times
before I get out of here...

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:16.816
but I'll see you again.

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:19.857
This side or the other.

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:55.400
<i>So I saw your picture yesterday.</i>

01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:01.156
- Are you sure it was me?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:05.235
- Oh, the Boys & Girls Club?
- Yeah.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:07.496
It was under a "local heroes" banner.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:11.033
Yeah. They got a real low standard
for who qualities on that.

01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:13.038
Apparently you were drafted.

01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:18.879
Yeah. I was slow.
And I couldn't skate backwards.

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:22.169
You're supposed to be able 
to skate backwards in pro hockey.

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:26.841
But I could shoot, you know?
I could hit anything with a hockey puck.

01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:32.604
But I got drafted and I just didn't do
what it took to make the team.

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:37.393
And when I got a second chance,
I blew that too.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:42.189
They sent me home and that was it.

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:44.778
I look at that picture
and I see a 20-year-old kid...

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:47.694
who thinks he's, you know,
got it all figured out.

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:52.617
Right before he's about
to throw it all away.

01:06:03.668 --> 01:06:06.547
Hey, I don't wanna rush anything,
but can we go into your room?

01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:09.557
Because my uncle the bus driver
lives right across the way...

01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:12.515
and he can see
right into this apartment.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.348
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:54.848
<i>They win the game in overtime. 
Then you flip it over.</i>

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.604
<i>Then you go back to Fenway Park.</i>

01:06:56.763 --> 01:06:59.516
<i>Then you get another great ending
to another...</i>

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:54.162
<i>--19, we walked through.</i>

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.743
<i>Nothing appears disturbed.</i>

01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:00.126
<i>In this apartment anyway.</i>

01:08:00.285 --> 01:08:01.958
Where the fuck's the truck?

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:05.006
<i>We shut and locked the door, but...</i>

01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:07.667
- What happened to 8:45?
- Late is what happened.

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:09.381
Fucking douche bag.

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:35.408
Say your prayers. 
Here we go.

01:08:38.865 --> 01:08:40.412
Here we go.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.053
Gun!

01:09:01.429 --> 01:09:03.102
Don't move!

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:10.069
- Go! Go!
- Get back! Get back!

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:12.231
Get out of the way!

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:24.585
<i>Any units in the area, 
10-61 in progress.</i>

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:26.087
The call went out!

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:28.665
Fuck.

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.587
Get out here, asshole,
I got your friend.

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:34.883
Calm down. Put your gun away,
all right? You're gonna get hurt.

01:09:35.046 --> 01:09:37.595
Put that fucking gun down now.
I got you, motherfucker.

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:40.510
Jesus!

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:44.479
You should have stayed in the truck, cunt.

01:09:45.098 --> 01:09:46.099
Let's go!

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:49.560
What the fuck just happened?

01:09:49.727 --> 01:09:53.197
- Goddamn it, I fucking told you.
- Fucking shut the fuck up, all right?

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:54.903
- Fucking knew it.
- Goddamn it!

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:59.988
All right, drive. Just take it easy, all right? 
Take it easy. Drive slow. Drive normal.

01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:04.788
- Shit.
- Ah, fuck.

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:08.417
They must have been around the corner.

01:10:49.036 --> 01:10:51.880
<i>Driver, turn your engine off.</i>

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:54.710
<i>Hands where I can see them.</i>

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:56.965
Fuck.

01:10:57.128 --> 01:11:00.348
<i>Shut the engine off now.
Put your hands in the a--</i>

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:10.525
Hit the engine block!

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.153
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.963
Go to the fucking switch!

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:49.856
Fuck!

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:59.445
How do you like that, motherfucker?

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:13.629
Let's go, let's go!

01:12:13.788 --> 01:12:15.415
- It's Dez.
- Let's go, let's go!

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:16.878
Drop it!

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:30.392
Let's go!

01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:49.703
Dino.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.163
What?

01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:52.834
Close the bridge.

01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:57.040
- What?
- Close the fucking bridge.

01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:17.815
<i>Alpha 101, Alpha 412, Alpha 407...</i>

01:13:17.977 --> 01:13:20.150
<i>en route to the north end
of the bridge.</i>

01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:22.486
They're going for the bridge.

01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:04.524
Now, that's how you drive
a fucking car.

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:22.962
All the DNA in Charlestown.

01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:50.407
The fuck was that?

01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:53.618
He didn't wanna end up on the wall
at the VFW.

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:01.080
<i>You print the inside of the van?</i>

01:15:01.247 --> 01:15:03.420
Frawl, the inside of the van
is a volcano.

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:07.257
Just find something and make it look
like something that looks like a print.

01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:10.423
<i>We don't have enough
for a conviction. Fine.</i>

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.592
<i>But I need to get them in a room.</i>

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.145
Right now, they are burning the money bands 
at some bullshit safe house.

01:15:16.303 --> 01:15:19.147
All their alibis were paid for
a week in advance.    

01:15:19.598 --> 01:15:22.522
We're not gonna pull any DNA
off of this or off the switch car.

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:26.030
And that, as they say, is that.

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:30.614
This is the "not fucking around" crew.
Find me something that looks like a print...

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:33.529
so I can grab one of these assholes
and shake their tree.

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:36.324
This "not fucking around" thing
is about to go both ways.

01:15:58.421 --> 01:16:00.173
Turn around for me, will you?

01:16:15.312 --> 01:16:17.940
- Mr. Coughlin.
- Lawyer.

01:16:25.489 --> 01:16:29.289
- This is it? Just say what's here?
- Yeah, go ahead. Read what's on the paper.

01:16:29.452 --> 01:16:30.704
All right.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.091
"You aren't supposed to come out of the truck. 
You got him but who got me?

01:16:35.249 --> 01:16:37.923
Courier, you're gonna get hurt."

01:16:39.503 --> 01:16:40.550
It's kind of short.

01:16:40.713 --> 01:16:42.966
Go ahead, read what's on the page.

01:16:43.591 --> 01:16:46.515
Right there? Um...

01:16:47.678 --> 01:16:50.306
"You aren't supposed
to come out of the truck."

01:16:50.473 --> 01:16:54.068
- Come on, come on.
- "You got him but who got me?"

01:16:57.521 --> 01:17:01.276
"Come here, get on the ground,
before I pop your fucking teeth out!"

01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:06.201
Come on, read it. Read it all.
There's about five things there.

01:17:06.947 --> 01:17:08.824
Uh...

01:17:09.575 --> 01:17:11.418
What is it with you guys
in Charlestown?

01:17:11.577 --> 01:17:14.626
Don't they teach you how to read?
There's things here. Read them.

01:17:14.789 --> 01:17:17.042
I don't wanna read that.
This doesn't sound right.

01:17:17.208 --> 01:17:20.382
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.
Read the pages, please.

01:17:20.544 --> 01:17:22.717
I'm trying to make this
sound authenticious.

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.178
- You got it all fucked up.
- Authen-what?

01:17:27.968 --> 01:17:29.470
Thanks.

01:17:29.637 --> 01:17:32.436
- Hey, Dougy, How are you?
- Oh.

01:17:34.266 --> 01:17:35.893
How you doing?

01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:38.028
Local crime fighter.

01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:39.897
What's happening, Dino?

01:17:40.981 --> 01:17:42.528
I know your father.

01:17:44.318 --> 01:17:47.037
Yeah. Me too.

01:17:47.196 --> 01:17:49.290
Got a few years left on his bid.

01:17:50.032 --> 01:17:51.955
Yeah, one or two.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.504
I hear they got to the old guy.

01:17:56.122 --> 01:17:57.795
Split him up the back.

01:17:57.957 --> 01:17:59.209
Fucking animals.

01:17:59.625 --> 01:18:02.128
You'd think they'd go after
a younger kid.

01:18:02.419 --> 01:18:05.423
I don't know.
Making a statement, I guess.

01:18:05.798 --> 01:18:08.176
Townie crews ain't
what they used to be.

01:18:09.593 --> 01:18:11.095
Dorchester...

01:18:11.262 --> 01:18:12.559
Southie...

01:18:13.139 --> 01:18:15.107
looking to make a move.

01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:18.944
Maybe you can change all that
when you get up there.

01:18:20.312 --> 01:18:23.236
Let me ask you a question.
What do you call a guy...

01:18:23.399 --> 01:18:26.619
who grows up with a group of people,
gets to know their secrets...

01:18:26.777 --> 01:18:28.871
because they trust him,
and then turns around...

01:18:29.029 --> 01:18:32.784
and use those secrets against them,
put those people in prison?

01:18:33.409 --> 01:18:36.413
You'd call him a rat, right?
You know what I call him?

01:18:36.579 --> 01:18:38.252
Dino the dago.

01:18:38.414 --> 01:18:41.258
Those people made you
a part of that community.

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:43.260
What did they get for it?

01:18:43.711 --> 01:18:45.964
Inside of the fucking can.

01:18:47.423 --> 01:18:51.018
You know we lifted a print
off the van? Right?

01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:01.438
Special Agent Frawley...

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:02.771
Douglas MacRay.

01:19:05.649 --> 01:19:07.322
You and your boys didn't just...

01:19:08.152 --> 01:19:12.248
roll a Star Market over in Malden 
for a box of quarters.

01:19:12.615 --> 01:19:14.617
No, you decided to bang it out...

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:18.128
in the North End at 9:00 in the morning.
With assault rifles.

01:19:19.079 --> 01:19:22.424
You fucking dummies shot a guard.

01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:27.509
Now you're like a half-off sale
at Big and Tall. Every cop is in line.

01:19:27.671 --> 01:19:29.514
Fortunately, though, for you...

01:19:29.673 --> 01:19:32.472
this guard,
who is two-thirds to a retard...

01:19:32.635 --> 01:19:34.228
has miraculously clung to life.

01:19:34.386 --> 01:19:36.013
Now, if it were up to me...

01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:38.933
and they gave me two minutes
and a wet towel...

01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:41.606
I would personally asphyxiate
this half-wit...

01:19:41.769 --> 01:19:43.988
so we could string you up
on a federal M1...

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:46.319
and end this story
with a bag on your head...

01:19:46.482 --> 01:19:49.326
and a paralyzing agent
running through your veins.

01:19:50.527 --> 01:19:53.872
This isn't fucking townie hopscotch
anymore, Doug.

01:19:55.324 --> 01:19:56.701
But I did want to say one thing.

01:19:57.159 --> 01:20:00.834
Just so we're both very, very clear.

01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:03.924
Because in these situations,
sometimes, you know...

01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:08.426
various parties will bandy about
the possibility of sentence reduction...

01:20:08.587 --> 01:20:12.842
for cooperation
or otherwise assisting the--

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:15.352
Assisting the prosecution.

01:20:17.721 --> 01:20:19.519
Not this time.

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:23.527
You're here today
so I could personally tell you...

01:20:23.686 --> 01:20:26.656
that you are going to die
in federal prison.

01:20:27.523 --> 01:20:29.696
And so are all your friends.

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:31.618
No deal.

01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:33.199
No compromise.

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:36.498
And when that day comes...

01:20:36.657 --> 01:20:39.536
when you start trying to be
my hero collaborator so hard...

01:20:39.702 --> 01:20:42.706
that I have to slap you to shut up--
And it will come...

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:48.719
despite your pitiable, misguided, 
Irish omerta.

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:52.381
When your code of silence
finally gives way...

01:20:52.548 --> 01:20:57.645
to fear of trafficking in cigarettes
to prevent sexual enslavement...

01:20:58.971 --> 01:21:03.818
I just want you to know that it's gonna 
be me who tells you to go fuck yourself.

01:21:08.564 --> 01:21:12.944
Hey, next time you guys
wanna take pictures of me, just call ahead.

01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:15.238
You know, we can do better
than a barbeque.

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:17.657
A calendar shoot. You know?

01:21:17.823 --> 01:21:19.541
Maybe topless, lubed up.

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:21.577
Whatever you guys are into.

01:21:22.536 --> 01:21:25.085
FBI car antennas
are half-inch matte black...

01:21:25.247 --> 01:21:27.966
about three-quarters the way down
the rear windshield.

01:21:28.125 --> 01:21:29.377
Statie are pigtailed...

01:21:29.543 --> 01:21:31.295
B.P.D., half and half.

01:21:31.712 --> 01:21:35.762
Every peewee in the town knows
what an FBI rear antenna looks like.

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:39.554
So, in the future, if you guys
are gonna try to be slick...

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:42.310
be slicker than a 6-year-old.

01:21:43.057 --> 01:21:44.775
I gotta get back to work.

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.727
Can I go?

01:21:50.314 --> 01:21:52.157
Good luck with that print.

01:22:22.679 --> 01:22:24.272
<i>Good morning, Cambridge Savings.</i>

01:22:24.431 --> 01:22:27.150
Claire Keesey, please.
She's the manager.

01:22:27.309 --> 01:22:30.153
<i>Oh, she's no longer working here.</i>

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:31.814
- Since when?
- <i>Friday.</i>

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:35.860
Just get the warrant. Land, cell, e-mail,
fax, Skype. The whole fucking thing.

01:22:42.116 --> 01:22:45.245
- Oh, my God, Doug,
- Took me forever trying to pick it out.

01:22:45.411 --> 01:22:48.335
- Yeah, it's beautiful.
- Is that all right?

01:22:48.497 --> 01:22:52.092
Yeah, but I can't accept that from you.
I can't take that.

01:22:52.251 --> 01:22:55.471
Why not? You can hawk it.
I'm not taking it back.

01:22:55.629 --> 01:22:57.677
No. I mean, you can't--

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.559
Keep it. 
Come on, sit down. Sit down.

01:23:00.717 --> 01:23:03.061
- Sit down.
- Okay.

01:23:08.475 --> 01:23:09.818
Wow.

01:23:12.312 --> 01:23:14.656
I quit my job today.

01:23:14.815 --> 01:23:16.237
What?

01:23:17.901 --> 01:23:19.619
What are you gonna do?

01:23:20.571 --> 01:23:27.250
Uh, I don't know. Volunteer full-time.
Maybe go back to teaching.

01:23:27.411 --> 01:23:30.540
I have a little cushion.

01:23:32.416 --> 01:23:33.884
You know...

01:23:34.334 --> 01:23:37.838
people get up every day,
they do the same thing.

01:23:38.005 --> 01:23:42.135
They tell themself they're gonna change 
their life one day and they never do.

01:23:42.843 --> 01:23:44.891
I'm gonna change mine.

01:23:46.847 --> 01:23:48.770
Why don't you do it with me?

01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:51.519
Go somewhere.

01:23:51.685 --> 01:23:56.737
I got a little sofa put away.

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:00.740
Give it a shot.

01:24:03.363 --> 01:24:05.115
Well, where would we go?

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:08.122
Wherever you want. 
I don't know.

01:24:08.285 --> 01:24:09.753
See what we got there.

01:24:11.038 --> 01:24:14.713
Doesn't have to be a big thing, you know?
I thought about going down to...

01:24:14.875 --> 01:24:19.096
see if my grandma's place is still there.
Tangerine, Florida.

01:24:19.254 --> 01:24:21.598
But I'll go to any town
named after a food.

01:24:21.757 --> 01:24:24.681
Grapefruit, Michigan.
Watermelon, New Mexico.

01:24:24.843 --> 01:24:27.471
Just pick it on a map.

01:24:31.141 --> 01:24:35.396
You ever read that paper <i>The Town?</i>

01:24:35.938 --> 01:24:38.316
- The free paper? Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

01:24:40.025 --> 01:24:43.996
I was clearing my foyer the other day...

01:24:44.154 --> 01:24:48.625
and there was a picture of the guys
who were harassing me in the bricks.

01:24:49.785 --> 01:24:51.207
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

01:24:51.370 --> 01:24:54.419
It was an article about 
how one of them got shot.

01:24:55.749 --> 01:24:58.002
- Say who did it?
- No.

01:24:58.544 --> 01:25:01.263
Local gangsters, apparently.

01:25:03.507 --> 01:25:07.057
I guess that's what you get
for being out on the street dealing drugs.

01:25:07.844 --> 01:25:10.768
What makes you say
they were dealing drugs?

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:15.903
I grew up out there, Claire.
Believe me, that kid was selling drugs.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.198
What do you want me to say?

01:25:20.524 --> 01:25:24.995
I feel bad the kid who was terrorizing you
ran into the wrong guys?

01:25:25.654 --> 01:25:27.156
Believe me, I don't.

01:25:28.115 --> 01:25:31.415
You know, I care about you.
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

01:25:31.577 --> 01:25:33.579
You don't go after women.

01:25:33.745 --> 01:25:36.715
He hurt you, someone hurt him.
Too bad. That's the way it goes.

01:25:36.873 --> 01:25:39.001
You know? That's karma.

01:25:42.129 --> 01:25:44.882
I don't think karma works like that.

01:25:46.592 --> 01:25:51.189
Well, however it works,
it worked out bad for them kids, you know?

01:25:51.346 --> 01:25:55.351
And I'm not gonna shed a tear over it.

01:25:56.810 --> 01:25:58.858
Let's go get some food, okay?

01:26:03.525 --> 01:26:05.027
<i>Frawl.</i>

01:26:07.279 --> 01:26:08.701
What is it?

01:26:08.864 --> 01:26:12.539
Phone conversation between Claire Keesey
and a burner cell about an hour ago.

01:26:12.701 --> 01:26:15.295
See if you can recognize the voice.

01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:18.715
<i>Hey, can I come over?
I want to talk to you.</i>

01:26:18.874 --> 01:26:20.717
<i>Yeah. Where have you been?</i>

01:26:21.126 --> 01:26:22.548
<i>Sorry, I got held up.</i>

01:26:22.711 --> 01:26:24.554
<i>I'm coming over from my place.</i>

01:26:24.713 --> 01:26:26.681
<i>Will you come down the back
and let me in?</i>

01:26:29.509 --> 01:26:31.728
<i>Hadn't realized you'd left
your job at the bank.</i>

01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:36.442
Uh... Oh, yeah. Yeah. 
Last week.

01:26:38.352 --> 01:26:40.696
I'm sorry,
was I supposed to notify someone?

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.073
Fancy.

01:26:47.277 --> 01:26:48.870
Yeah. It was a gift.

01:26:54.576 --> 01:26:57.079
Look, I think maybe you should go.

01:26:57.245 --> 01:26:59.293
We have our suspects.

01:27:00.749 --> 01:27:03.298
I came by to share this with you.

01:27:06.630 --> 01:27:08.632
James Coughlin.

01:27:08.882 --> 01:27:10.850
Albert Magloan.

01:27:12.177 --> 01:27:13.724
Desmond Elden.

01:27:13.887 --> 01:27:16.811
Part of a crew that we tied
into the bankjob at North End...

01:27:16.973 --> 01:27:21.069
and at least three other
armored car robberies.

01:27:25.524 --> 01:27:27.071
Look familiar?

01:27:29.736 --> 01:27:32.285
You opened the safe for him.

01:27:33.031 --> 01:27:35.454
He left you unharmed...

01:27:35.617 --> 01:27:40.669
and now the two of you are carrying on 
a relationship about which you lied to the FBI.

01:27:40.831 --> 01:27:41.923
I was wrong.

01:27:42.916 --> 01:27:44.793
You do need a lawyer.

01:27:52.801 --> 01:27:54.428
Something wrong with the apartment?

01:27:54.594 --> 01:27:56.813
No, Florist.

01:27:57.723 --> 01:27:58.895
Florist? What?

01:27:59.057 --> 01:28:00.559
Came through.

01:28:01.017 --> 01:28:04.317
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- It's large, Dougy.

01:28:04.479 --> 01:28:06.652
- It's large.
- We're smoked. Punt it.

01:28:06.982 --> 01:28:09.952
- Who else is gonna buy it?
- You should've thought about that...

01:28:10.110 --> 01:28:12.704
before you kept breaking the guy off
for 40 dimes.

01:28:12.863 --> 01:28:15.207
- There's an expectation for me.
- I'll correct it.

01:28:15.365 --> 01:28:18.995
- Oh, you will? Okay.
- Yeah. Look.

01:28:19.161 --> 01:28:24.338
Look, pick up an extra guy. All right?
Or go with three guys.

01:28:24.583 --> 01:28:26.836
Or fucking be smart and boot it.

01:28:27.002 --> 01:28:28.970
Oh, so you're not going?

01:28:30.130 --> 01:28:31.382
No.

01:28:33.175 --> 01:28:34.597
And why's that?

01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.104
Because we got a ton of heat on us,
for one thing.

01:28:37.262 --> 01:28:39.685
We'll put a move on.
We've done it a hundred times.

01:28:39.848 --> 01:28:42.897
You know what? Forget it.
Do what you want to do. I'm done.

01:28:43.059 --> 01:28:44.686
- What? What?
- I'm done.

01:28:44.853 --> 01:28:47.197
- You're done?
- What does it sound like?

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:50.029
- I don't know. What's that mean?
- What you think it means?

01:28:50.192 --> 01:28:52.661
What does that mean?
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit.

01:28:52.819 --> 01:28:56.699
Let me put it to you this way: I'm putting 
this whole fucking town in my rear-view.

01:28:59.159 --> 01:29:01.537
There's people I can't let you
walk away from.

01:29:02.996 --> 01:29:04.213
What?

01:29:04.998 --> 01:29:06.375
Who?

01:29:08.001 --> 01:29:09.423
Come on.

01:29:12.214 --> 01:29:14.342
Are you serious, Jimmy?

01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:16.552
She's not my kid.

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:23.775
I mean, come the f-- 
Cut it out.

01:29:23.934 --> 01:29:26.028
All you give a fuck about
is coke and Xbox...

01:29:26.186 --> 01:29:29.065
now you're trying to play it off
like you care about Shyne?

01:29:29.231 --> 01:29:32.110
Know what your problem is?
You think you're better than people.

01:29:32.275 --> 01:29:34.949
Mr. Fucking-Clean.
Mr. Fucking-Goddamn-High-and-Mighty.

01:29:35.111 --> 01:29:37.864
I'm better than all these people.
I'm better than everybody.

01:29:38.031 --> 01:29:40.284
But you grew up right here.

01:29:40.867 --> 01:29:42.961
Same rules that I did.

01:29:43.495 --> 01:29:44.792
Okay.

01:29:45.247 --> 01:29:46.794
What else?

01:29:48.917 --> 01:29:50.419
Who the fuck's the father?

01:29:51.628 --> 01:29:53.756
- I know I'm not.
- You were the one fucking her.

01:29:53.922 --> 01:29:56.175
Yeah, I wasn't the only one, brother.

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:58.643
Okay? She knew I knew I'm not the father...

01:29:58.802 --> 01:30:01.396
and I have enough respect for her
not to ask her.

01:30:01.555 --> 01:30:03.273
Because I don't think she knows.

01:30:03.431 --> 01:30:06.275
I don't wanna shatter
your illusions here, partner.

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:08.562
There aren't enough free clinics
in Mattapan...

01:30:08.728 --> 01:30:11.322
to find out who the father
of that kid is.

01:30:11.857 --> 01:30:14.326
I don't know who the fuck
you think you are either.

01:30:14.985 --> 01:30:17.704
You aren't letting me
or not letting me do shit, all right?

01:30:17.863 --> 01:30:19.536
Here's a little cheat sheet for you.

01:30:19.698 --> 01:30:22.793
It's never gonna be me and you
and your sister and Shyne...

01:30:22.951 --> 01:30:24.544
fucking playing house up there.

01:30:24.703 --> 01:30:28.003
All right? You got it?
Get that in your fucking head!

01:30:28.164 --> 01:30:31.168
I'm tired of your one-way
fucking bullshit.

01:30:31.334 --> 01:30:35.464
If you wanna see me again,
come down and visit me in Florida.

01:30:41.344 --> 01:30:42.391
Cunt.

01:31:10.665 --> 01:31:12.588
In the 302...

01:31:13.376 --> 01:31:16.050
feds have me dropping Brendan right here.

01:31:17.631 --> 01:31:19.929
<i>I got him back on Tibbetts.</i>

01:31:21.509 --> 01:31:23.511
Shot him right in the chest.

01:31:25.013 --> 01:31:26.356
I remember he looked at me.

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:30.018
I don't know who was more fucking surprised 
he wasn't dead, him or me.

01:31:30.352 --> 01:31:32.354
We just kind of stood there...

01:31:33.021 --> 01:31:36.491
for a second, like, waiting for some shit 
to happen. I don't know what.

01:31:37.692 --> 01:31:39.365
He started running.

01:31:39.861 --> 01:31:42.831
Fucking guy ran 100 yards
with a bullet in his heart, Dougy.

01:31:42.989 --> 01:31:47.119
I mean, the fucking guy should've ran track.
You know what I'm saying?

01:31:51.206 --> 01:31:52.583
I didn't ask you to do that.

01:31:52.749 --> 01:31:54.877
Yeah, well, you didn't have to, Dougy.
Come on.

01:31:55.543 --> 01:31:59.468
They told me Brendan was coming down here 
to roll up on you with a Glock 21.

01:31:59.631 --> 01:32:02.601
So I came over here,
and I put him in the fucking ground.

01:32:04.469 --> 01:32:06.187
Did nine years for it.

01:32:08.139 --> 01:32:09.891
Now, you don't gotta thank me...

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:12.398
but you're not walking away.

01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:17.406
I'm grateful for everything 
you done for me.

01:32:18.692 --> 01:32:21.662
Your family took me in
when my father went away.

01:32:24.489 --> 01:32:26.332
You're like a brother to me.

01:32:28.076 --> 01:32:29.749
But I'm leaving.

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:34.207
Gonna shoot me?

01:32:35.417 --> 01:32:36.919
Go ahead.

01:32:38.211 --> 01:32:40.634
But you're gonna have to shoot me
in the back.

01:32:52.851 --> 01:32:54.774
- Don't get up.
- All right.

01:32:54.936 --> 01:32:56.734
How you doing, Fergie?

01:32:56.896 --> 01:33:00.696
Listen, just wanted to stop by
and tell you myself...

01:33:01.443 --> 01:33:04.196
whatever this thing is 
you got going on...

01:33:04.362 --> 01:33:07.457
I think my guys can handle it
without me. You know what I mean?

01:33:07.615 --> 01:33:09.617
I wouldn't hire them without you.

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:11.707
And I wouldn't hire you without them.

01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:13.122
You're a unit.

01:33:13.288 --> 01:33:17.088
Look, with all due respect,
I didn't come here for a debate.

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:19.298
I'm not doing it.

01:33:19.544 --> 01:33:23.424
So, you know, work it out
however you can. I...

01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:26.389
Calm down. Okay?

01:33:26.551 --> 01:33:29.475
It goes against my better judgment...

01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:33.309
but just out of respect,
smooth things over...

01:33:33.808 --> 01:33:36.106
just take this for it, all right?

01:33:36.686 --> 01:33:37.778
Not gonna cut it.

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:41.484
Do you think I'm gonna put
Joe Flipperhead on this?

01:33:41.983 --> 01:33:43.951
You're gonna do what I ask.

01:33:44.110 --> 01:33:45.327
Not gonna cut it, huh?

01:33:47.906 --> 01:33:49.158
Okay.

01:33:49.324 --> 01:33:52.419
Let me ask you something.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

01:33:52.827 --> 01:33:54.921
The only guy in Charlestown
with a gun?

01:33:55.330 --> 01:33:57.253
You guys run numbers and pump dope.

01:33:57.415 --> 01:34:00.510
You're an old guy who don't know
his glory years are behind him.

01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:03.672
I ain't fucking working for you.
Got it?

01:34:04.339 --> 01:34:08.765
You got a problem with that, I live at
551 Bunker Hill Street. Stop by anytime.

01:34:08.927 --> 01:34:10.645
You know where to find me.

01:34:11.262 --> 01:34:13.310
You're gonna do this for me...

01:34:13.473 --> 01:34:15.851
or I'm gonna clip your nuts...

01:34:16.184 --> 01:34:17.652
like I clipped your daddy's.

01:34:18.269 --> 01:34:19.816
Don't talk about my father.

01:34:19.979 --> 01:34:22.528
Son, I knew your daddy.

01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:25.614
He worked for me for years. Years.

01:34:26.152 --> 01:34:28.246
Then he wanted his own thing.

01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:32.037
You play the horses?

01:34:33.827 --> 01:34:38.583
You know, they either geld a horse
with a knife...

01:34:38.748 --> 01:34:40.716
or with the chemicals.

01:34:41.209 --> 01:34:43.303
When your daddy said no to me...

01:34:43.753 --> 01:34:45.721
I did him the chemical way.

01:34:46.297 --> 01:34:48.049
Gave your mother a taste.

01:34:48.216 --> 01:34:49.843
Put the hook into her.

01:34:50.218 --> 01:34:52.562
She doped up good and proper.

01:34:53.346 --> 01:34:56.145
Hung herself with a wire
on Melnea Cass.

01:34:56.766 --> 01:34:59.690
And you? Running around the neighborhood, 
looking for her.

01:35:00.562 --> 01:35:02.906
Your daddy didn't have the heart
to tell his son...

01:35:03.064 --> 01:35:06.238
that he was looking for a suicide doper
who was never coming home.

01:35:07.652 --> 01:35:11.031
If there's a heaven, son,
she ain't in it.

01:35:16.369 --> 01:35:17.416
Oh.

01:35:19.581 --> 01:35:22.004
I hear you got a nice,
sweet new girlfriend.

01:35:22.167 --> 01:35:23.714
Lives on the park.

01:35:24.502 --> 01:35:27.597
I don't want to send her
funeral arrangement to your house...

01:35:28.464 --> 01:35:30.307
but I will if I have to.

01:35:31.301 --> 01:35:33.349
Now I know where to find you.

01:35:35.138 --> 01:35:36.606
Claire.

01:35:37.599 --> 01:35:39.226
Claire?

01:35:50.904 --> 01:35:52.121
- Hey.
- Get out.

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:53.452
You okay?

01:35:54.199 --> 01:35:56.622
- Get out.
- Hold on one second.

01:35:56.784 --> 01:35:58.286
I have this on 911.

01:35:58.453 --> 01:36:01.627
All right, you need to give me a chance
to explain myself first. Okay?

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:02.881
No. You had a chance.

01:36:04.209 --> 01:36:05.756
Who talked to you?

01:36:07.212 --> 01:36:09.465
The FBI, Doug.

01:36:11.716 --> 01:36:13.639
You have to listen to me.

01:36:13.801 --> 01:36:16.304
You have to let me explain this.
You understand?

01:36:16.471 --> 01:36:19.691
- There's a lot going on here, Claire--
- No, you go to fucking hell!

01:36:20.433 --> 01:36:22.310
- Fucking hell.
- All right, all right.

01:36:22.477 --> 01:36:23.979
All right. All right.

01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:25.772
Easy, now.

01:36:26.981 --> 01:36:28.904
Why did you do this to me?

01:36:29.067 --> 01:36:31.866
Claire, I'm sorry. Okay?

01:36:32.028 --> 01:36:34.907
I was gonna tell you.
I came over here that night to tell you.

01:36:35.073 --> 01:36:38.748
What, the night you fucked me?
Is that your thing?

01:36:38.910 --> 01:36:43.461
It's not enough to terrorize someone,
you have to fuck them too?

01:36:43.623 --> 01:36:48.470
- Listen to me. Calm down, okay?
- No. No. Get out. Get out!

01:36:49.963 --> 01:36:54.844
You don't ever let me see you again.
Never, never.

01:39:23.533 --> 01:39:25.752
I'm taking off for a while.

01:39:26.411 --> 01:39:28.584
Are you taking heat?

01:39:36.337 --> 01:39:38.465
Well, when are you coming back?

01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:47.849
You know about this thing for Fergie
Jem wants me to do?

01:39:48.015 --> 01:39:49.358
Yeah.

01:39:53.104 --> 01:39:55.198
Tell him I say yes for me, will you?

01:39:58.025 --> 01:39:59.493
Yeah.

01:40:11.539 --> 01:40:13.007
All right.

01:40:14.459 --> 01:40:15.711
I'm in.

01:40:16.878 --> 01:40:19.131
But if anything happens to her...

01:40:19.297 --> 01:40:21.550
if I think anything
might happen to her...

01:40:22.383 --> 01:40:23.555
I'm coming back here.

01:40:24.594 --> 01:40:27.643
And I'm gonna kill both of you
in your own shop.

01:40:43.905 --> 01:40:45.623
Hey, Claire?

01:40:47.241 --> 01:40:50.711
I just wanna talk to you,
just for two minutes. Okay?

01:40:51.412 --> 01:40:53.005
Come on.

01:40:54.457 --> 01:40:55.925
Claire, I would never hurt you.

01:40:56.083 --> 01:40:58.552
I don't know what you would--
Don't fucking touch me.

01:40:58.711 --> 01:40:59.883
All right.

01:41:00.254 --> 01:41:01.597
I'm sorry.

01:41:02.089 --> 01:41:04.592
Just listen to me for a second,
all right?

01:41:04.759 --> 01:41:06.261
I will never lie to you again.

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:08.600
- Really?
- Yes, I promise you.

01:41:09.096 --> 01:41:11.440
Ask me anything you want.
I'll tell you the truth.

01:41:11.599 --> 01:41:13.476
- Why? I won't believe you.
- Yes, you will.

01:41:13.643 --> 01:41:14.690
Why?

01:41:14.852 --> 01:41:17.105
Because you'll fucking hate the answers.

01:41:21.817 --> 01:41:24.491
- You knew I was the manager in the bank?
- Yup.

01:41:24.654 --> 01:41:27.032
- Were you following me?
- Yes.

01:41:27.406 --> 01:41:28.953
How many banks have you robbed?

01:41:29.825 --> 01:41:31.372
Six trucks, two banks.

01:41:31.786 --> 01:41:33.379
Have you ever killed anyone?

01:41:33.538 --> 01:41:35.085
No.

01:41:36.207 --> 01:41:37.504
Think about it.

01:41:38.209 --> 01:41:39.552
All right?

01:41:39.710 --> 01:41:42.133
I will never lie to you,
I will never hurt you...

01:41:42.296 --> 01:41:47.598
and if I lose you, I will regret that 
for the rest of my life.

01:41:50.471 --> 01:41:53.395
Just wait for me.

01:42:05.403 --> 01:42:08.828
<i>You know, it's funny.
I can see your daddies' faces in you.</i>

01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:10.082
All of youse.

01:42:10.241 --> 01:42:11.993
Reminds me I'm still in the ring.

01:42:12.326 --> 01:42:16.581
Still taking the punches.
Still ahead on points.

01:42:16.956 --> 01:42:19.709
Now, I have a fellow
on the inside there.

01:42:19.875 --> 01:42:23.675
He likes to play the ponies.
Has a gambling sickness.

01:42:23.838 --> 01:42:26.466
He couldn't pick a horse
to save his fucking life.

01:42:27.008 --> 01:42:29.306
But courtesy of this sick man...

01:42:30.261 --> 01:42:32.980
I have this. Hm?

01:42:34.849 --> 01:42:37.648
Well, the gang's all here.

01:42:39.937 --> 01:42:41.689
There's always a weak spot.

01:42:41.856 --> 01:42:43.858
We just need to find it.

01:42:47.403 --> 01:42:51.374
The cash is brought out and stacked
15 minutes before the van does the pickup.

01:42:52.658 --> 01:42:54.752
That is when you hit.

01:42:55.161 --> 01:42:57.914
And Monday morning,
after a four-game stand with New York...

01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:03.007
60,000 beers, food, merchandise,
total haul:

01:43:03.169 --> 01:43:04.671
Three and a half million.

01:43:08.716 --> 01:43:13.062
Taking down the cathedral of Boston.

01:43:13.262 --> 01:43:14.388
Priceless.

01:43:29.362 --> 01:43:32.411
How long you think it's gonna take Rusty
to dump the inside man...

01:43:32.573 --> 01:43:33.790
when this thing's over?

01:43:33.949 --> 01:43:36.577
Well, he should have picked
better horses.

01:43:39.955 --> 01:43:42.708
This is gonna be a motherfucker.
You know that, right?

01:43:43.751 --> 01:43:47.756
Well, if they were easy, kid,
everybody would do them.

01:43:52.259 --> 01:43:55.638
<i>Lined into right field. A base hit. 
Youkilis is headed for third base.</i> 

01:43:55.805 --> 01:43:58.558
Hey, Bobby. 
Yeah, three Buds.

01:44:06.857 --> 01:44:09.827
Seem to be having a bit
of a staring contest over there.

01:44:09.985 --> 01:44:11.157
What can I say?

01:44:11.779 --> 01:44:13.326
Boys like me.

01:44:14.782 --> 01:44:16.125
I bet they do.

01:44:21.789 --> 01:44:24.087
I was at a bar one night, right?

01:44:24.250 --> 01:44:27.094
There was this guy there
going around to all the ladies...

01:44:27.253 --> 01:44:31.679
and telling them that he was
judging a hugging contest.

01:44:32.258 --> 01:44:35.182
Some of them actually bought it, right?

01:44:35.344 --> 01:44:39.895
So he throws his arms around them,
rubs their back, grabs their ass.

01:44:40.057 --> 01:44:41.434
Charming.

01:44:42.977 --> 01:44:45.355
Finally I get sick of it
and I go up to this guy...

01:44:45.646 --> 01:44:50.322
and I tell him that I am judging
a face-punching contest.

01:44:50.484 --> 01:44:53.988
Oh. I'd have punched him myself.

01:45:03.164 --> 01:45:05.758
By the way, I'm here tonight
judging a fucking contest.

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:11.547
What are you doing down here?

01:45:12.173 --> 01:45:13.425
Slumming?

01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:16.848
I work for the FBI.

01:45:17.803 --> 01:45:19.521
Me too.

01:45:20.890 --> 01:45:22.358
Well, you must be new.

01:45:25.686 --> 01:45:27.188
You're all right.

01:45:28.063 --> 01:45:30.532
It doesn't mean
you're getting fucked, though.

01:45:31.025 --> 01:45:34.529
You gotta chase the rabbit
if you want the tail.

01:45:36.155 --> 01:45:37.452
My mom taught me that.

01:45:42.119 --> 01:45:44.838
You used to hang around
with Doug MacRay a little bit, huh?

01:45:45.998 --> 01:45:47.375
How do you know Dougy?

01:45:47.541 --> 01:45:49.259
We sort of work together.

01:45:49.668 --> 01:45:50.965
Sand and Gravel?

01:45:51.587 --> 01:45:53.339
No. No, no.

01:46:00.679 --> 01:46:03.057
You a pretty decent judge of size?

01:46:03.599 --> 01:46:04.896
Depends.

01:46:05.559 --> 01:46:07.061
Size of what?

01:46:08.395 --> 01:46:09.897
How big would you say that is?

01:46:10.773 --> 01:46:11.990
Six inches?

01:46:12.566 --> 01:46:14.068
Over or under?

01:46:14.401 --> 01:46:15.448
Under.

01:46:15.611 --> 01:46:16.783
Wrong.

01:46:17.363 --> 01:46:19.582
6.14 inches exactly.

01:46:21.242 --> 01:46:23.370
I know everything there is to know
about money.

01:46:23.577 --> 01:46:26.421
Thickness: .0043 inches.

01:46:27.248 --> 01:46:31.173
Weight about one gram.

01:46:31.877 --> 01:46:33.800
Which is interesting...

01:46:33.963 --> 01:46:37.763
because that means that this $20 bill
isn't even worth its own weight...

01:46:37.925 --> 01:46:39.893
in Oxy.

01:46:45.599 --> 01:46:47.101
So how does it work?

01:46:48.269 --> 01:46:50.112
Bartender gets a call...

01:46:51.188 --> 01:46:54.192
you pick up a package at point A,
deliver it to point B...

01:46:54.358 --> 01:46:56.907
the Florist gives you C?

01:47:00.698 --> 01:47:02.541
You're thinking of running out on me.

01:47:04.243 --> 01:47:07.292
It's not that simple.
Because, you see...

01:47:08.372 --> 01:47:10.215
I start waving this around in here...

01:47:14.962 --> 01:47:16.305
bad for you.

01:47:20.676 --> 01:47:22.303
I want a lawyer.

01:47:22.636 --> 01:47:24.559
Good. Get one.

01:47:25.472 --> 01:47:28.066
I mean, it's all about 
protecting yourself, right?

01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:31.650
Not even yourself. 
Your daughter.

01:47:31.812 --> 01:47:34.315
Don't talk about my daughter.

01:47:36.609 --> 01:47:38.987
How long were you with MacRay?

01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:41.367
All my life.

01:47:42.656 --> 01:47:45.250
In all those years
that you were together...

01:47:47.161 --> 01:47:50.381
how many diamond necklaces
did he give you?

01:47:55.169 --> 01:47:59.675
<i>All right, here's the deal.
Looks like we're pretty dialed in.</i>

01:48:02.301 --> 01:48:05.350
<i>Dez took the van home
over the weekend...</i>

01:48:05.512 --> 01:48:07.139
<i>so that should work.</i>

01:48:10.476 --> 01:48:13.696
<i>He's meeting bug eyes 
at the plant on Monday.</i>

01:48:17.816 --> 01:48:21.821
<i>Krista booked the rooms, set up the outfits,
and made the New Hampshire run.</i>

01:48:24.323 --> 01:48:26.451
<i>That's what I got.
How you looking?</i>

01:48:26.617 --> 01:48:28.369
<i>All right, the tools are set.</i>

01:48:28.535 --> 01:48:30.708
Got our body armor.

01:48:34.124 --> 01:48:35.967
You know, this thing goes right...

01:48:36.377 --> 01:48:38.755
could be your turn
to step away too.

01:48:38.921 --> 01:48:41.891
Yeah. Sure.

01:48:42.132 --> 01:48:43.725
What am I gonna do, Dougy, huh?

01:48:43.884 --> 01:48:48.390
Go down to Margaritaville, drink me half a yard 
and fall off fucking bar stools?

01:48:50.015 --> 01:48:51.562
Do me a favor.

01:48:52.101 --> 01:48:53.899
The weight of this thing...

01:48:54.561 --> 01:48:56.655
pack a parachute at least.

01:48:57.106 --> 01:48:59.825
You know the funniest thing
about being in prison?

01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:04.158
Guys pretending
that they wanna get out.

01:49:07.074 --> 01:49:08.371
Fuck.

01:49:09.451 --> 01:49:13.081
You ever hear the old-timers
call a guy a "50-pound horse"?

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:16.049
"Fifty-pound horse"? No.

01:49:16.208 --> 01:49:18.006
All right. Ahem.

01:49:18.168 --> 01:49:20.512
A guy's walking with two horses, right?

01:49:20.671 --> 01:49:24.426
One horse is carrying a hundred pounds,
the other one's got 50.

01:49:24.591 --> 01:49:29.597
Now, the hundred-pound horse falls over
dead. So the guy's like, "What the fuck?"

01:49:29.763 --> 01:49:32.858
Takes the hundred-pound sack,
puts it on the 50-pound horse.

01:49:33.017 --> 01:49:35.941
Then that 50-pound horse,
he won't move.

01:49:37.062 --> 01:49:40.441
He won't take one step
with another pound on his back.

01:49:41.358 --> 01:49:42.951
That's me.

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.208
This is all I know.

01:49:53.412 --> 01:49:55.631
I can't do any more time, Dougy.

01:49:58.375 --> 01:50:00.002
So if we get jammed up...

01:50:00.627 --> 01:50:02.595
we're holding court on the street.

01:50:04.256 --> 01:50:05.303
All right?

01:50:11.472 --> 01:50:12.940
Mule.

01:50:14.224 --> 01:50:15.441
What's that?

01:50:15.601 --> 01:50:17.854
The story the old-timers tell...

01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:20.022
it ain't a horse.

01:50:20.522 --> 01:50:23.071
It's a 50-pound mule.

01:50:24.151 --> 01:50:25.994
See you out there.

01:50:29.948 --> 01:50:31.325
What time did he get here?

01:50:31.492 --> 01:50:34.336
Six a.m. according to the GPS
we have on his truck.

01:50:34.495 --> 01:50:35.621
So we alerted you.

01:50:38.082 --> 01:50:39.800
Pop the door, kick their nuts in.

01:50:39.958 --> 01:50:42.882
We should wait for them to commit a crime, 
don't you think, Dino?

01:50:43.045 --> 01:50:44.092
No switch car.

01:50:45.506 --> 01:50:47.759
<i>Ran a cue hot on the parking lot.</i>

01:50:47.925 --> 01:50:49.177
<i>That Cherokee is boosted.</i>

01:50:55.307 --> 01:50:57.309
Call SWAT now.

01:51:03.148 --> 01:51:04.320
FBI! Open the door!

01:51:04.483 --> 01:51:06.110
- FBI!
- Open the door! Open it!

01:51:06.276 --> 01:51:08.153
Open the door! Open it!

01:51:08.529 --> 01:51:09.701
FBI! FBI!

01:51:11.031 --> 01:51:13.409
You brought the whole fucking
cavalry for me?

01:51:13.575 --> 01:51:15.748
I'm unarmed, you motherfuckers.

01:51:32.970 --> 01:51:35.268
Fuck are you doing here, Kris?

01:51:35.889 --> 01:51:37.186
I need to talk to you.

01:51:37.349 --> 01:51:38.976
Not a great time, hon.

01:51:39.143 --> 01:51:40.360
- I know.
- You know?

01:51:40.519 --> 01:51:42.487
Okay. Well, what do you want?

01:51:42.646 --> 01:51:43.943
Here you go.

01:51:44.398 --> 01:51:46.196
Dez told me you were here.

01:51:48.026 --> 01:51:49.403
I wanna see you before you go.

01:51:49.570 --> 01:51:52.915
Kris, you could do 30 years
for walking in the door.

01:51:53.073 --> 01:51:55.246
Okay? Do you understand that?
For being here.

01:51:55.409 --> 01:51:58.458
You can't be bringing your kid in here, 
you got it? You can't stay.

01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:01.214
I don't wanna stay,
I wanna go with you.

01:52:01.623 --> 01:52:03.466
- I wanna change too, Dougy.
- Christ.

01:52:03.625 --> 01:52:06.549
Why the fuck can't I change?
I could be a different person.

01:52:06.712 --> 01:52:08.055
Jesus Christ.

01:52:08.213 --> 01:52:11.467
You tell me what you want me to do.
I'll be whoever you want me to be.

01:52:12.843 --> 01:52:14.845
I'm leaving with somebody else.

01:52:19.016 --> 01:52:20.313
Oh, yeah?

01:52:20.934 --> 01:52:22.151
Yeah.

01:52:24.021 --> 01:52:25.944
Why isn't she here then?

01:52:27.149 --> 01:52:29.026
Come on.
What do you want me to tell you?

01:52:29.193 --> 01:52:31.787
She's going away with you,
why isn't she here?

01:52:31.945 --> 01:52:33.868
Where is she? 
She's not here.

01:52:35.449 --> 01:52:37.668
- Such a trashy little fuck pad.
- Take it easy.

01:52:37.826 --> 01:52:40.955
After a Tiffany necklace,
I thought a room at the Ritz.

01:52:41.371 --> 01:52:42.918
Huh?

01:52:44.082 --> 01:52:45.459
What'd you say?

01:52:46.627 --> 01:52:49.471
Where did you hear that?
Where'd you hear about a necklace?

01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:51.473
A little bird.

01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:56.644
Fucking smartass. Who told you that?
Who told you about a necklace?

01:52:58.138 --> 01:53:01.187
I know you'd rather see a rope
around my neck!

01:53:02.851 --> 01:53:05.104
You're getting the fuck out of here.
Let's go.

01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:08.274
Come here, honey.
I know, it's gonna be okay. It's all right.

01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:10.818
- We're coming with you.
- You're getting out of here.

01:53:10.984 --> 01:53:12.827
Dougy, we're fucking coming with you.

01:53:12.986 --> 01:53:16.206
It's time to go. Okay? 
Here we go.

01:53:16.365 --> 01:53:19.665
Time to go, sweetheart. Okay?

01:53:19.826 --> 01:53:21.328
- I'm not leaving here.
- Let's go.

01:53:21.495 --> 01:53:23.589
- I'm not fucking leaving.
- Take the kid home.

01:53:23.747 --> 01:53:25.420
Get the fuck off me!

01:53:25.582 --> 01:53:27.505
I can walk myself.

01:53:28.001 --> 01:53:29.924
Don't you say no to me!

01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:34.762
Take this.

01:53:42.182 --> 01:53:43.354
Hey.

01:53:43.976 --> 01:53:47.321
Will you quit fucking doing that?
You're making me nervous.

01:54:01.868 --> 01:54:05.213
Yeah, we got a DWI over here, one car.

01:54:05.372 --> 01:54:08.797
Coughlin, Kristina.
She had a kid with her.

01:54:09.459 --> 01:54:12.053
<i>The mother's at Mass General.
She wanted me to call you.</i>

01:54:12.212 --> 01:54:14.840
All right, yeah. 
I'll be right there.

01:54:43.118 --> 01:54:44.335
Officer.

01:54:45.329 --> 01:54:46.876
Yeah. Let's go.

01:54:54.171 --> 01:54:55.514
Down here.

01:55:48.892 --> 01:55:50.565
There's the door.

01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:53.772
And remember,
you never fucking saw me.

01:55:54.022 --> 01:55:55.194
Okay.

01:56:10.163 --> 01:56:12.882
<i>Dr. Forrest, dial 112, please.</i>

01:56:13.041 --> 01:56:16.011
<i>Dr. Forrest, please dial 112.</i>

01:56:20.173 --> 01:56:23.848
Here he is, Mr. Six-Inches.

01:56:25.679 --> 01:56:26.726
What happened?

01:56:26.888 --> 01:56:30.313
You're a crimestopper,
figure it the fuck out.

01:56:32.352 --> 01:56:33.604
Sweetheart.

01:56:34.688 --> 01:56:38.238
I know you have oxycodone,
cocaine and alcohol in your system.

01:56:39.443 --> 01:56:42.037
I know that you have five cars
registered in your name.

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:45.699
And I know right now, your daughter
is sitting in the back of a state van...

01:56:45.866 --> 01:56:48.119
driven to the 
Department of Social Services.

01:56:48.285 --> 01:56:49.878
So how long you wanna do this?

01:56:50.036 --> 01:56:51.208
I'm a person, you know?

01:56:51.371 --> 01:56:53.544
A person who's gonna need 
a plea agreement...

01:56:53.707 --> 01:56:55.880
if you ever want to see your kid again.

01:56:59.504 --> 01:57:02.508
Why is it always I'm the one
who's getting used?

01:57:03.425 --> 01:57:04.768
What do you have?

01:57:10.807 --> 01:57:12.480
Knowing just that...

01:57:13.894 --> 01:57:15.646
Dougy's going away after.

01:57:16.813 --> 01:57:19.657
Wait, what after? After what?

01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:25.410
Krista, I need you to be smart here.

01:57:25.822 --> 01:57:29.292
This could be a big moment for Shyne.

01:57:30.494 --> 01:57:32.496
Make a huge difference in her life.

01:57:39.961 --> 01:57:41.804
We can help you, sweetheart.

01:58:36.476 --> 01:58:37.853
- You there?
- <i>I'm here.</i>

01:58:38.019 --> 01:58:40.818
- All set.
- Okay. Go ahead.

01:58:41.523 --> 01:58:42.820
All set.

01:58:51.199 --> 01:58:52.325
Who called 911?

01:58:53.952 --> 01:58:55.545
You the guys who called 911?

01:58:55.704 --> 01:58:57.206
No one from here called.

01:58:57.372 --> 01:58:59.045
Nah, we didn't-- 
It wasn't us.

01:58:59.207 --> 01:59:00.424
We got a 911 call.

01:59:00.584 --> 01:59:02.006
Robbery, guys. 
Come on.

01:59:02.168 --> 01:59:03.715
- You said a robbery?
- Yeah.

01:59:03.878 --> 01:59:05.596
A call saying you're being held up.

01:59:05.755 --> 01:59:07.428
- Let me call Mike.
- We just walked past Mike.

01:59:07.591 --> 01:59:08.592
He let us in.

01:59:08.758 --> 01:59:11.682
Hey, look, guys, We got a distress call.
All right?

01:59:11.845 --> 01:59:14.268
- So who made the call?
- Nobody called from here.

01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:17.768
No one called? 
What are we doing here?

01:59:17.934 --> 01:59:21.108
- Hold on. Where's Mike?
- I just told you where Mike was.

01:59:21.271 --> 01:59:22.363
You boys see all right?

01:59:22.522 --> 01:59:24.775
- Huh? You fucking smartass.
- Listen. Listen.

01:59:24.941 --> 01:59:27.990
For our safety, for everyone's safety,
we need to see your IDs.

01:59:28.153 --> 01:59:30.702
Guys, hold up.
We been here all morning. Take it easy.

01:59:30.864 --> 01:59:33.868
My partner asked for your ID.
All right? We don't know you.

01:59:34.034 --> 01:59:37.538
Till we identify all the parties involved here,
we're gonna need some IDs...

01:59:37.704 --> 01:59:39.832
we need to see everyone on the ground. 
Right now.

01:59:39.998 --> 01:59:41.215
Whoa, whoa.

01:59:41.374 --> 01:59:43.627
- Get your hand off your weapon.
- Hey, relax.

01:59:50.133 --> 01:59:52.932
- Get on the ground!
- Get on the fucking ground.

01:59:53.303 --> 01:59:54.600
Hands behind your back.

01:59:54.763 --> 01:59:55.935
Face down.

01:59:56.097 --> 01:59:58.520
Behind your back. 
Come on.

02:00:05.273 --> 02:00:08.368
Get your hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back. Let's go.

02:00:08.526 --> 02:00:09.994
- Take it easy.
- Fuck.

02:00:17.577 --> 02:00:18.829
In the cash room.

02:00:18.995 --> 02:00:22.590
Arnold Washton.
You live at 311 Hazer Street in Quincy...

02:00:22.749 --> 02:00:25.923
with a wife named Linda
and three small dogs.

02:00:26.086 --> 02:00:28.464
Do not make a distress call.

02:00:28.630 --> 02:00:30.724
Also in the cash room:

02:00:30.882 --> 02:00:36.059
Morton Previtt.
You live at 27 Counting Lane, Randolph.

02:00:36.221 --> 02:00:38.519
Wife, also Linda.

02:00:38.682 --> 02:00:42.732
Morton, the Lindas
want you to open this door.

02:00:42.936 --> 02:00:45.564
We have men outside your homes.

02:00:49.651 --> 02:00:52.495
Back up. Back up.

02:01:13.508 --> 02:01:15.476
You think you're gonna get out of here?

02:01:15.802 --> 02:01:19.102
I got friends that are guards at Walpole.
They'll make your lives hell.

02:01:19.556 --> 02:01:21.558
Well, don't you worry about it, old-timer.

02:01:21.725 --> 02:01:23.477
No one's going to prison.

02:01:41.411 --> 02:01:42.879
Ten more.

02:01:43.037 --> 02:01:44.289
Right away.

02:01:58.052 --> 02:01:59.304
Picking up.

02:02:31.377 --> 02:02:33.971
<i>Least from the fan base
when the Red Sox win.</i>

02:02:34.130 --> 02:02:38.180
<i>When the Red Sox win in extra innings
and everybody can go home happy...</i>

02:02:38.343 --> 02:02:40.971
<i>and they're singing "Dirty Water"--</i>

02:02:43.848 --> 02:02:45.816
- How you doing?
- Fucking beautiful.

02:02:48.269 --> 02:02:49.612
Come on.

02:02:58.321 --> 02:03:02.167
Last motherfucker who robbed
the Red Sox like this was Jack Clark.

02:03:51.624 --> 02:03:54.924
Looked around the block.
There's no cars, no vans around. Nothing.

02:03:55.128 --> 02:03:57.256
Maybe we're too early. 
Or too late.

02:03:57.422 --> 02:04:01.518
Let's go. I want this street clear. Come on,
get these people out of here. Let's go.

02:04:01.676 --> 02:04:06.807
We've been trying to hail security for the
cash room. We're not getting a response.

02:04:09.017 --> 02:04:11.065
Okay, let's go,
Let's get the fuck out of here.

02:04:11.227 --> 02:04:12.649
Come on.

02:04:16.774 --> 02:04:18.026
Come on.

02:04:22.322 --> 02:04:23.539
Shit.

02:04:44.010 --> 02:04:47.014
- Fuck!
- Let's get the fuck out of here!

02:04:52.393 --> 02:04:54.361
That's us inside.

02:04:56.481 --> 02:04:57.698
Go! Go!

02:05:02.028 --> 02:05:04.406
Fuckers!

02:05:19.587 --> 02:05:21.681
Gloans! Gloans. Fuck.

02:05:24.133 --> 02:05:27.763
- He all right?
- He's all right. They just got the vest.

02:05:36.896 --> 02:05:38.489
Yo, Dez, get the plunger!

02:05:57.875 --> 02:05:59.718
Shut it!

02:06:20.857 --> 02:06:22.734
Dez?

02:06:24.318 --> 02:06:25.820
Come on, come on.

02:06:28.072 --> 02:06:29.574
They look like EMTs.

02:06:29.741 --> 02:06:32.460
<i>I count four. 
Maybe one down.</i>

02:06:32.618 --> 02:06:34.245
Go.

02:06:36.748 --> 02:06:38.341
Let's get the fuck out of here.

02:06:38.791 --> 02:06:41.044
There's a million fucking cops
out there.

02:06:41.210 --> 02:06:42.757
Dez!

02:06:45.631 --> 02:06:46.678
Listen.

02:06:48.176 --> 02:06:52.807
The three of us, even if we get out of here,
we're getting the full ride, okay?

02:06:53.306 --> 02:06:56.025
You walk out with your hands up,
you could get seven years.

02:06:56.768 --> 02:06:58.770
No one'll think the worse of you.

02:07:01.064 --> 02:07:02.156
Fuck you.

02:07:08.279 --> 02:07:09.576
Cover your ears!

02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:35.272
No!

02:07:42.355 --> 02:07:44.653
- All right, go, go, go.
- All right, move it out.

02:08:01.833 --> 02:08:03.050
Fuck you!

02:08:09.423 --> 02:08:11.551
Move down.
Get them the fuck out of here.

02:08:11.717 --> 02:08:13.594
Meet me at the fucking switch!

02:08:17.682 --> 02:08:20.026
They ain't looking for fucking cops.

02:08:20.393 --> 02:08:22.236
I'm gonna roll out the front...

02:08:22.395 --> 02:08:26.241
the two of youse beat it out the side 
in the fucking cop uniforms.

02:08:27.150 --> 02:08:29.152
The whole fucking force
is out there, kid.

02:08:29.318 --> 02:08:31.571
You know I can take a pinch.

02:08:31.904 --> 02:08:35.158
Don't worry about it.
I'll only give them your first name.

02:09:06.355 --> 02:09:07.948
Clear.

02:09:12.737 --> 02:09:14.455
Okay, go.

02:09:15.281 --> 02:09:16.783
Move, move.

02:09:23.122 --> 02:09:25.295
Hey, don't move. Don't move.

02:09:26.292 --> 02:09:29.045
- Put your weapons down.
- Fuck you. Boston P.D.

02:09:29.212 --> 02:09:32.261
Look out, coming through.
Stand down. Stand down.

02:09:32.423 --> 02:09:33.720
See you in Florida, kid.

02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:36.394
See you when you get back.

02:09:36.719 --> 02:09:38.221
All right. Go.

02:09:38.387 --> 02:09:42.017
All right, guys, let's back up.
Feds got this.

02:09:44.894 --> 02:09:46.396
Hey. Hey.

02:09:46.562 --> 02:09:48.314
You B.P.D. need to fuck off.

02:09:48.481 --> 02:09:50.779
What are you doing?
It's an FBI crime scene.

02:09:50.942 --> 02:09:52.535
Don't put your hand up to me. Go.

02:09:52.693 --> 02:09:54.411
Jurisdiction, guys. Walk away.

02:09:54.570 --> 02:09:55.742
That's my kill.

02:10:09.502 --> 02:10:11.596
I don't know if we're dealing with...

02:10:11.754 --> 02:10:14.177
some high level of genius here
with security...

02:10:14.507 --> 02:10:17.351
but security's saying
they got hit by cops.

02:10:17.843 --> 02:10:19.095
Cops?

02:10:19.262 --> 02:10:22.266
Yeah. Two cops, they said.

02:10:36.570 --> 02:10:37.867
Hold up.

02:10:38.155 --> 02:10:39.202
Where you going?

02:10:40.241 --> 02:10:41.288
Pull up here.

02:10:54.547 --> 02:10:56.641
Officer, can you hold up a minute?

02:11:06.183 --> 02:11:09.733
Visual on Coughlin,
heading south toward Boylston.

02:11:09.895 --> 02:11:11.772
Hotel parking lot on Van Ness.

02:11:11.939 --> 02:11:13.737
He's dressed as B.P.D.

02:11:14.191 --> 02:11:15.317
<i>Copy.</i>

02:11:15.484 --> 02:11:17.031
Officer.

02:11:18.904 --> 02:11:20.406
Coughlin.

02:11:59.195 --> 02:12:00.868
Drop your weapon!

02:12:02.698 --> 02:12:04.291
No!

02:12:06.369 --> 02:12:08.042
Move! Move!

02:12:32.812 --> 02:12:35.361
Coughlin, throw down your weapon.

02:12:37.608 --> 02:12:39.406
Fuck you.

02:12:39.902 --> 02:12:41.495
Let me see those hands, right now.

02:12:41.654 --> 02:12:43.247
Fuck you!

02:12:50.621 --> 02:12:52.339
Move, move.

02:12:53.541 --> 02:12:55.259
You got 30 seconds, asshole.

02:13:23.988 --> 02:13:25.365
Okay.

02:13:25.531 --> 02:13:27.283
I surrender.

02:13:27.575 --> 02:13:29.043
I surrender.

02:14:30.763 --> 02:14:33.391
Rusty, something went wrong.

02:14:33.557 --> 02:14:34.729
Come here.

02:14:45.861 --> 02:14:47.238
Fergie.

02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:49.281
Prick.

02:15:20.354 --> 02:15:21.947
Fergie...

02:15:22.648 --> 02:15:24.992
remember who clipped your nuts for you.

02:15:26.318 --> 02:15:30.323
<i>I came in hot, saw the suspect run
across the street with a Tec-9.</i>

02:15:30.489 --> 02:15:35.165
I lit up the tires, I jumped out of the cruiser,
engaged the suspect in gunfire.

02:15:36.203 --> 02:15:37.204
So that's when...

02:15:37.371 --> 02:15:39.169
- you get out of your cruiser.
- Yeah.

02:15:39.331 --> 02:15:42.926
At that point, I fired, struck the suspect
at least once or twice.

02:15:43.085 --> 02:15:44.211
Hey.

02:15:44.503 --> 02:15:46.096
<i>Multiple victims down.</i>

02:15:46.255 --> 02:15:48.053
<i>Location, 529 Main Street, Charlestown.</i>

02:15:48.215 --> 02:15:50.684
- <i>Uniformed officers on the scene.</i>
- That's the Florist.

02:15:50.843 --> 02:15:52.390
Hey, Bobby, Bobby, what happened?

02:15:52.553 --> 02:15:54.180
Somebody got Fergie.

02:15:55.889 --> 02:15:57.937
- Jesus Christ, that's gotta be MacRay.
- Fuck.

02:16:04.815 --> 02:16:07.193
<i>Claire, it's me.</i>

02:16:07.484 --> 02:16:08.531
<i>Are you okay?</i>

02:16:09.528 --> 02:16:10.529
<i>I'll be fine. I know.</i>

02:16:10.696 --> 02:16:13.165
<i>But I'm okay. I'm all right.</i>

02:16:13.324 --> 02:16:15.076
<i>Claire, I wanna meet you.</i>

02:16:16.702 --> 02:16:20.047
<i>It's gotta be soon.
I don't have a lot of time.</i>

02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:23.042
<i>Can you meet me?</i>

02:16:24.043 --> 02:16:25.215
<i>Claire, please.</i>

02:16:26.045 --> 02:16:28.468
<i>I need to know. I gotta go.</i>

02:16:29.506 --> 02:16:31.224
Can you come here?

02:16:37.222 --> 02:16:39.270
You want me to come 
where you are now?

02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:40.816
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

02:16:44.730 --> 02:16:47.233
I don't think
that's a good idea for me.

02:16:51.028 --> 02:16:52.245
Why?

02:16:57.575 --> 02:16:59.374
What if there are police there?

02:17:01.413 --> 02:17:03.005
<i>There's no one here.</i>

02:17:08.754 --> 02:17:11.678
All right, well, if you think I should
probably come by there...

02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:14.263
then I guess that's what I'll do. Yeah.

02:17:15.761 --> 02:17:16.933
Okay.

02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:21.228
<i>Claire, listen, I'm--
Listen. Listen to me.</i>

02:17:23.394 --> 02:17:24.896
<i>I'm sorry, okay?</i>

02:17:26.313 --> 02:17:28.531
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

02:17:29.941 --> 02:17:31.285
Remember that.

02:17:31.985 --> 02:17:34.955
<i>Come down in the back
and let me in in about an hour.</i>

02:17:37.782 --> 02:17:39.251
All right?

02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:42.746
I'll see you.

02:17:44.164 --> 02:17:45.962
Wait, Doug? Doug?

02:17:47.084 --> 02:17:48.552
- Yeah.
- <i>I want you to come.</i>

02:17:48.710 --> 02:17:51.635
<i>I really wanna see you.</i>

02:17:56.343 --> 02:17:59.313
It'll be just like one of my sunny days.

02:18:11.608 --> 02:18:12.825
Well...

02:18:14.986 --> 02:18:16.660
I'm on my way then.

02:18:19.491 --> 02:18:20.492
Bye.

02:18:24.163 --> 02:18:26.085
Goodbye, Claire.

02:18:32.212 --> 02:18:34.431
All right,
I'd say we've done our part here.

02:18:34.590 --> 02:18:37.218
You know what? Not now.

02:18:43.182 --> 02:18:46.026
<i>I know he says he's coming, 
but I want people at Logan, South Station...</i>

02:18:46.184 --> 02:18:48.563
downtown, Greyhound, subway, 
everything. Now.

02:18:48.728 --> 02:18:50.982
- <i>The city's covered.</i>
- <i>Good.</i>

02:19:13.754 --> 02:19:16.507
<i>We're secure, and everything's ready.</i>

02:19:22.763 --> 02:19:26.734
- Sir, we need you to stay off the street.
- Just going to work. No problem.

02:19:42.907 --> 02:19:44.660
- How long?
- Forty minutes.

02:19:45.160 --> 02:19:47.037
- Alleyway clear?
- Yes, sir.

02:20:00.551 --> 02:20:03.646
<i>We got nothing.
Still no movement in the alley. Over.</i>

02:20:05.013 --> 02:20:08.267
Well, I guess he didn't have as big 
a thing for you as you thought.

02:20:10.018 --> 02:20:11.861
I guess not.

02:20:33.667 --> 02:20:35.260
"My sunny days." 

02:20:42.843 --> 02:20:45.642
You know, Claire,
we are a national organization.

02:20:53.687 --> 02:20:56.782
All right, boys, let's pack it up.
He ain't coming.

02:20:56.940 --> 02:20:59.409
Let's get the description out.
Let's go.

02:20:59.651 --> 02:21:01.494
We know what he looks like.

02:21:02.529 --> 02:21:03.872
Let's go find him.

02:21:07.492 --> 02:21:08.618
All right. You good?

02:21:08.785 --> 02:21:10.583
Hey, best possible outcome, you know.

02:21:10.746 --> 02:21:12.669
Well done, well done.

02:21:50.452 --> 02:21:51.920
It's for you.

02:22:57.269 --> 02:23:00.694
<i>Claire, take this.</i>

02:23:00.981 --> 02:23:03.609
<i>You'll do better with it than I can.</i>

02:23:04.234 --> 02:23:06.828
<i>By the time you read this,
I'll be long gone.</i>

02:23:06.987 --> 02:23:08.284
<i>Not the way I planned it...</i>

02:23:08.780 --> 02:23:12.830
<i>but for the first time in my life,
I'm leaving this city.</i>

02:23:25.422 --> 02:23:26.469
<i>Maybe if I go...</i>

02:23:27.549 --> 02:23:29.176
<i>I can stop looking.</i>

02:23:51.198 --> 02:23:52.916
<i>No matter how much you change...</i>

02:23:53.075 --> 02:23:55.999
<i>You still have to pay the price
for the things you've done.</i>

02:23:59.164 --> 02:24:01.007
<i>So I got a long road.</i>

02:24:06.671 --> 02:24:09.015
<i>But I know I'll see you again.</i>

02:24:14.846 --> 02:24:16.848
<i>This side or the other.</i>
