00:10.270 --> 00:12.530
[owl hooting]

00:13.620 --> 00:15.230
[digging]

00:24.670 --> 00:26.060
[thud]

00:36.990 --> 00:38.610
[grunting]

00:38.810 --> 00:40.560
Jesus, Mary and...

00:57.230 --> 00:59.620
It's like crawling up
an old pig's arse.

01:04.540 --> 01:06.150
[groaning]

01:15.980 --> 01:18.040
- The body's
nearly eight days old.

01:18.240 --> 01:21.870
- I was told
the state would be otherwise.
Naught I can do now.

01:22.070 --> 01:25.560
- I'll make it work,
but I may not accept delivery
next time.

01:57.330 --> 01:58.990
[cracking]

01:59.190 --> 02:00.720
[sighing]

02:34.370 --> 02:36.150
[heart beating]

03:10.230 --> 03:11.750
Ah...

03:15.760 --> 03:17.150
[laughing]

03:21.540 --> 03:23.110
[chuckling]

03:27.030 --> 03:29.680
Keep beating, damn you.
Come on.
[panting]

03:34.640 --> 03:36.040
Dammit!

03:51.050 --> 03:55.850
- Why's this door even locked?
- Same reason why the room
is soundproof: privacy.

03:56.050 --> 03:58.460
If someone's
in the middle of a session
and we just burst in--

03:58.660 --> 04:00.450
- Right, right.
[sighing]

04:26.040 --> 04:27.530
- I still don't think
this is right.

04:27.730 --> 04:30.270
- You can either unlock
that door...

04:30.470 --> 04:33.960
or I can arrest you
for obstruction
and I'll just unlock it myself.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.920
Stay back.

04:39.360 --> 04:43.840
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Not a step further.

04:54.380 --> 04:55.810
[gasping]

05:03.120 --> 05:04.470
Good morning.

05:05.690 --> 05:07.480
I trust you slept well.

05:08.390 --> 05:11.960
I slept like I hadn't a care
in the world.

05:12.790 --> 05:16.920
A benefit, no doubt,
of having a refined young woman
such as yourself in the house.

05:18.620 --> 05:20.660
Did you notice the gown
on the chair?

05:21.970 --> 05:23.670
I bought it for you.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.490
No.

05:26.450 --> 05:28.510
It's a gift, my dear.

05:28.710 --> 05:30.330
A token of my esteem.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.720
Please don't deny me
this happiness.

05:34.070 --> 05:36.590
It's... lovely. Thank you.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.770
You will look exquisite.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.960
Gladys can do
any necessary alterations

05:43.150 --> 05:46.000
if there's something
not to your liking,
but there won't be.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.910
I have an eye for figures.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.480
Yours especially.

05:53.910 --> 05:55.570
When will I be going home?

05:59.050 --> 06:00.890
Are you not happy here?

06:01.090 --> 06:03.670
Is there... something you lack?

06:03.870 --> 06:05.490
I want for nothing, truly.

06:06.670 --> 06:09.230
I draw such comfort
from my father's Bible.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.460
It helps me strengthen
my resolve--

06:12.660 --> 06:15.280
- To remain a good...
honourable girl.

06:21.380 --> 06:24.250
Breakfast is in exactly
10 minutes.
Don't be late.

06:26.380 --> 06:27.820
Wear the dress.

06:40.050 --> 06:42.360
- Surely the Devil's Elbow
can be reformed.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.490
- There are many facets
to the problem.

06:45.970 --> 06:50.020
Everything we might consider
essential - education,

06:50.220 --> 06:53.370
cleanliness, even their health -
is an afterthought.

06:53.570 --> 06:56.380
Because it must be.
They are perpetually working.

06:56.580 --> 06:59.760
- Then how do we help them
to secure better work
to allow for balance?

07:00.850 --> 07:04.550
- It's difficult
in this class system
in the absence of education.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.260
Then we teach them to read.

07:07.460 --> 07:10.040
- I must speak to her!
[panting]
Please--

07:10.240 --> 07:11.910
I'm sorry, ma'am. I tried.

07:12.110 --> 07:15.090
- Forgive
this boorish intrusion,
my dear Mrs. Simcoe,

07:15.290 --> 07:17.660
but you're the only person
who can aid me.

07:17.860 --> 07:21.050
I've just lost
my beloved friend Terrence
and I am not myself.

07:21.250 --> 07:22.440
No.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.870
Oh, Monsieur Rondeau.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.880
- Blessed are those who mourn,
for they will be comforted.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.230
Let God be your refuge
and your strength.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.880
- Please have a seat,
Monsieur Rondeau.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.800
Thank you.

07:39.370 --> 07:42.420
- I am so terribly sorry
for the loss of your friend.

07:42.620 --> 07:45.430
- Thank you.
There has been so much death.

07:45.630 --> 07:47.160
Too much.

07:48.070 --> 07:50.430
I come to you, dearest lady,

07:50.630 --> 07:52.780
because you are my one chance
to make things right

07:52.980 --> 07:55.250
with his spirit
before I leave town.

07:55.600 --> 07:59.220
I would be forever in your debt
if you would use
your formidable talents

07:59.420 --> 08:02.170
to reach Terrence
beyond the veil of death.

08:03.090 --> 08:04.660
That's a preposterous request.

08:04.860 --> 08:07.740
- I'm aware of how it sounds,
but if only--
- But nothing.

08:09.140 --> 08:12.890
I apologize. I don't mean
to interfere with your affairs,
but...

08:13.090 --> 08:14.790
I believe you must refuse.

08:15.750 --> 08:18.940
- I haven't had a restful
night's sleep since the seance.

08:19.140 --> 08:20.930
- And I would not burden you
with this.

08:23.150 --> 08:26.850
You made yourself very clear,
but I have tried to make contact
with him numerous times.

08:27.630 --> 08:29.820
I do not have the strength
of your gift.

08:30.020 --> 08:32.560
- My curse, you mean.
- This is against God.

08:32.760 --> 08:36.250
- Mrs. Simcoe, you know the pain
of losing someone...

08:37.690 --> 08:39.350
Someone you love!

08:39.550 --> 08:40.990
With my heart!

08:41.470 --> 08:43.830
I would not ask
if there were any other way.

08:44.030 --> 08:48.000
- An unnatural request
borne of unnatural feelings--
- Pastor, that is enough.

08:51.790 --> 08:54.960
The connection
I made to Alistair
was entirely unexpected.

08:55.490 --> 08:58.460
I'm not even sure I'll be able
to reach the spirit world again.

08:58.650 --> 09:00.500
I will be here to guide you.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.590
Mrs. Simcoe, please.

09:02.790 --> 09:04.670
I fear for your soul.

09:08.630 --> 09:10.330
I will do it.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.850
I feel I must.

09:15.070 --> 09:17.380
On the condition that Pastor
may attend the seance to protect
my soul from damnation.

09:19.730 --> 09:21.290
Of course.

09:22.250 --> 09:23.910
I'm at your disposal.

09:35.180 --> 09:36.840
- We can pay what's owed
on the house.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.840
And we may even have enough
to buy back
a piece of furniture!

09:40.620 --> 09:42.930
- The Chippendale!
- I want a phonograph
for my room.

09:43.130 --> 09:44.890
Tsk. Sister.

09:45.090 --> 09:47.720
- You assured me my sacrifice
would bring me comforts.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.150
- It will,
but we mustn't lose control.

09:50.930 --> 09:53.070
Your pain
is nearly extinguished.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.550
This...
really is the best solution.

09:57.680 --> 10:02.040
Basil will soon cast aside
his pitted cherry
and return to your loving arms.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.560
- Mm-hmm! Pitted.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.350
You wicked creature.
[laughing]

10:07.550 --> 10:10.470
[doorbell ringing]
[gasping]
- Oh!

10:11.910 --> 10:13.170
Oh!

10:15.390 --> 10:17.580
Hide that in case
it's a collector.

10:17.780 --> 10:20.930
- I am in no mood
for a conversation
by the door today, sister.

10:21.130 --> 10:22.440
Yes, yes.

10:28.360 --> 10:29.620
Mr. Garvey.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.290
Ms. Botticelli.

10:32.490 --> 10:34.900
- Where's Verdi?
Is... something wrong?

10:35.100 --> 10:37.820
- Not at all.
I've come for her things.

10:38.010 --> 10:41.510
- But Verdi's on loan to you.
- The arrangement has changed.

10:43.380 --> 10:45.030
Well, that's not proper...

10:47.030 --> 10:48.600
...or acceptable.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.780
[slamming]
And as her beloved family,
we do not consent.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.700
[sighing]

11:10.230 --> 11:14.330
It's a humble room,
but anyone would be glad
for that bed, that desk.

11:14.530 --> 11:17.250
- You wouldn't.
Nor would your sister.

11:17.450 --> 11:19.670
Verdi came to us with nothing.

11:20.070 --> 11:22.470
- Well, those days
have changed for her.

11:22.670 --> 11:26.390
And by the looks of things,
just beginning for you.
[Venetia laughing]

11:26.580 --> 11:28.300
I must say, Mr. Garvey,

11:28.500 --> 11:31.700
had I known our sister
would provide so much joy
and pleasure,

11:31.890 --> 11:34.210
I would've asked for more.

11:37.690 --> 11:39.350
Goodbye, Miss Botticelli.

11:46.140 --> 11:49.190
- If you're changing the terms
of the deal,
if you're going to keep Verdi,

11:49.390 --> 11:51.750
then we require
a new financial arrangement.

12:04.680 --> 12:08.640
- I will arrange her head clear
off her neck if I ever lay eyes
on our sister again!

12:10.730 --> 12:12.250
[sighing]

12:18.910 --> 12:22.350
[soft, intense music]
[hard knocking]
[gasping]

12:25.480 --> 12:27.440
- [sighing]
- Oof.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.830
Detective.

12:31.090 --> 12:33.280
That was rather energetic
knocking.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.020
My apologies.

12:35.220 --> 12:38.010
I became rather concerned
when I couldn't find you
at your home.

12:39.710 --> 12:41.420
Have you been here all night?

12:41.620 --> 12:44.060
- Mm-hmm.
- Can anyone confirm that?

12:44.800 --> 12:46.890
If necessary. Why?

12:47.500 --> 12:49.770
The Widow. She's struck again.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.650
- She certainly isn't wasting
any time.

12:52.850 --> 12:56.000
- No, she's not. I was hoping
you could come with me
to examine the victim's body.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.740
Now, if possible.

12:57.940 --> 13:02.430
- Of course.
- I should warn you.
It's... it's a lot to take in.

13:03.870 --> 13:08.700
- I've performed autopsies on
hundreds of brutalized bodies,
Detective. I'll be fine.

13:32.150 --> 13:33.850
Isn't time of the essence?

13:51.220 --> 13:54.700
- I brought this to help you
make contact with Terrence.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.790
It had great meaning for him.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.400
His energy still resides
within it.

14:09.370 --> 14:13.410
I assure you, madam,
you are entirely up to the task.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.500
Shall we begin?

14:19.770 --> 14:21.420
I'm here to protect you.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.300
Breathe deeply.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.780
Release doubt
and sink deep within.

14:32.480 --> 14:36.260
Find the place
that keeps the living
from the spirit world.

14:40.270 --> 14:43.840
I call upon the spirits, Isis,

14:44.040 --> 14:46.800
the winged Ahura Mazda,

14:47.000 --> 14:51.150
all beneficent immortals and
peaceful deities of the terma...

14:52.020 --> 14:56.630
...allow Terrence Crenshaw
to come and speak with us now.

15:01.460 --> 15:02.900
What is it?

15:04.460 --> 15:05.990
[moaning]

15:06.730 --> 15:08.560
What are your senses
telling you?

15:08.760 --> 15:10.340
[gasping]

15:12.560 --> 15:14.270
So much pain.

15:14.460 --> 15:17.870
- This... this should stop now--
- No... What else?

15:19.090 --> 15:20.580
Where am I?

15:20.780 --> 15:23.060
[crying]
I don't know where I am.

15:23.260 --> 15:25.270
- You're here, Regina.
You're here.

15:27.700 --> 15:30.230
- Oh. She's not Mrs. Simcoe
any longer.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.110
O spirit,

15:33.310 --> 15:37.510
speed through eternal darkness
beyond the gates of the sun

15:37.710 --> 15:40.330
and reveal yourself
in this humble vessel.

15:40.530 --> 15:42.280
[moaning]

15:53.690 --> 15:56.520
I am here...

15:57.780 --> 15:59.130
Terrence?

16:00.650 --> 16:03.100
My one... my all!

16:03.300 --> 16:05.100
[grunting softly]

16:05.300 --> 16:08.880
Why... do you... raise me?

16:09.960 --> 16:13.060
I am gone.
[breath rasping]

16:13.260 --> 16:15.280
To tell you...

16:15.480 --> 16:18.540
I wish we had time
to discover what might've been.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.120
I wanted to say
a proper goodbye,

16:22.320 --> 16:25.500
before you ford
the bitter waters
of the River Styx.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.030
Before I flee.

16:28.230 --> 16:32.250
Where will you... flee to?

16:34.730 --> 16:36.380
Anywhere but here.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.310
[exclaiming]
I am a hunted man.

16:39.510 --> 16:40.960
[breath rasping]

16:41.160 --> 16:43.610
Darkness... will follow.

16:44.430 --> 16:47.580
- Darkness?
[gasping]
- She... will follow.

16:47.780 --> 16:50.800
No matter where you go!

16:51.000 --> 16:52.700
She...
[gasping]

16:53.660 --> 16:55.840
[groaning and gasping]

17:08.720 --> 17:11.690
- Now, this...
this unholy insanity stops now!

17:11.890 --> 17:14.650
- [gasping]
- Do not... run!
[exclaiming]

17:14.850 --> 17:17.390
- God's light shines upon us!
God's love--

17:17.590 --> 17:19.830
- I'll stay.
Terrence, do you hear me?

17:20.020 --> 17:22.090
- I call upon you, God,
to watch over us!

17:22.290 --> 17:24.440
- I'd rather face her here--
[shouting]

17:24.640 --> 17:27.820
- -cocooned in the warm
remembrance of our embraces!

17:29.000 --> 17:30.780
Terrence!
[sobbing]

17:39.620 --> 17:41.580
You wouldn't mind if I...?

17:42.140 --> 17:43.230
Please.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.940
So the wounds...

17:49.140 --> 17:51.860
they were done by an assailant
who was left-handed,

17:52.060 --> 17:55.720
which is consistent with all
of the previous Widow attacks.

17:58.420 --> 18:01.950
- But the brutality
of the amputations and...

18:03.690 --> 18:05.730
...the opening
of the chest cavity...

18:06.990 --> 18:09.870
...and the cuts
along the ribs appear...

18:10.910 --> 18:12.700
...ragged and messy.

18:13.170 --> 18:14.910
Like the killer was rushed.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.960
- Well,
I was outside the door...

18:18.740 --> 18:20.710
...likely while - ahem -

18:20.910 --> 18:22.320
the Widow was doing this.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.320
How did she escape?

18:25.450 --> 18:27.070
- Presumably
while I was in the bar,

18:27.270 --> 18:29.580
summoning the barkeep
to unlock the door.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.630
- Nonetheless,
she had time to inflict...

18:35.940 --> 18:37.590
...a lot of mayhem...

18:38.550 --> 18:41.810
...and all while staying clear
of major organs and arteries.

18:45.380 --> 18:47.160
There has to be a reason.

18:53.130 --> 18:54.350
Yeah.

18:56.430 --> 18:58.740
To prolong Salomé's pain.

19:00.870 --> 19:03.270
- How could anyone
possibly endure...?

19:04.830 --> 19:06.100
Here.

19:07.920 --> 19:11.670
Morphine, cocaine or heroin
could keep him
from going into shock.

19:19.410 --> 19:22.900
- You and Salomé, you were...
you were close.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.470
We were friends.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.820
The Widow...

19:36.650 --> 19:39.350
The Widow wanted Salomé
to feel every cut.

19:40.910 --> 19:45.140
Experience the cruel sensations
as she mutilated him.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.570
Dismembering him.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.750
He was alive through it all,
until...

19:58.540 --> 20:00.190
I can't die like this.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.150
I won't.

20:05.680 --> 20:09.900
I'd rather spend
the rest of my days in jail
than suffer like Salomé did.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.990
- Is there something
you want to tell me?

20:17.300 --> 20:18.780
The Widow...

20:19.520 --> 20:22.000
...in her note,
said that we needed to confess.

20:25.480 --> 20:26.870
So I do.

20:28.530 --> 20:30.310
I confess to my role...

20:31.310 --> 20:32.930
...to Basil Garvey's role,

20:33.130 --> 20:35.270
to the great Georges Rondeau's
role...

20:37.840 --> 20:39.720
...in a murder.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.240
Of whom?

20:44.540 --> 20:46.240
Margaret Mehar.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.160
[panting]

20:55.510 --> 20:57.470
[groaning and panting]

21:05.260 --> 21:08.310
- If you can magically
poof yourself out of here,
be my guest.

21:08.510 --> 21:12.230
Otherwise, sit the fuck down!
You are getting on my nerves!

21:12.430 --> 21:14.960
- No point.
Darkness will follow.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.980
- Darkness is already here.
The good doctor
opened her big mouth,

21:20.180 --> 21:22.810
and now that witless copper
thinks one of us is the Widow.

21:23.010 --> 21:24.640
It's not me, obviously.

21:24.830 --> 21:27.150
- It's not as obvious
as it may seem.

21:27.590 --> 21:31.240
- Yes. Don't you make it a habit
to carve up people for show?

21:32.110 --> 21:35.040
- You know, George...
when we get out of here,

21:35.240 --> 21:37.820
I'm gonna find a way
to personally thank you

21:38.020 --> 21:40.860
for doing me
such a great fucking favour.

21:41.510 --> 21:44.260
And I don't need disguises
to put someone in the ground.

21:44.460 --> 21:47.910
- Ah, no.
You have the constant stream
of threats.

21:48.610 --> 21:52.270
If anything,
the lady doth protest too much,
methinks.

21:52.470 --> 21:55.540
- I'm not the Widow,
you stick-waver.

21:55.740 --> 21:59.280
- If anyone's the Widow,
it's the great Georges Rondeau,

21:59.480 --> 22:01.490
master of disguise.

22:02.490 --> 22:05.410
- By all means,
ladies and gents,
accuse each other.

22:06.060 --> 22:08.810
Makes our jobs easier.
[chuckling]
Ahem.

22:09.010 --> 22:10.640
Mr. Garvey.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.060
Sir.

22:12.940 --> 22:15.150
Our new superintendent...

22:18.200 --> 22:19.820
...would like a word.

22:20.020 --> 22:21.740
- If this is some
preferential treatment--

22:21.940 --> 22:25.130
- Ah, don't get your knickers
in a knot, Monsieur Rondeau.

22:25.330 --> 22:27.650
You're next.
[clicking tongue]

22:33.560 --> 22:35.710
- [bell tolling]
- If I haven't said it before,

22:35.910 --> 22:38.740
I am truly grateful
for your presence of mind.

22:39.350 --> 22:40.970
I shudder to think
what might've happened

22:41.170 --> 22:43.440
if you hadn't stopped the seance
when you did.

22:44.660 --> 22:46.370
- Your intentions
were admirable,

22:46.570 --> 22:49.330
but... your spirit
has been weakened by grief.

22:49.530 --> 22:53.070
- In future, I shall encourage
people to look to our Lord
and Saviour for answers

22:53.270 --> 22:54.980
about their dearly departed.

22:57.460 --> 23:00.680
Working at such a young age.
It's inhumane.

23:05.640 --> 23:07.470
This one should do perfectly.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.350
Hello!

23:12.550 --> 23:15.620
I'm Mrs. Simcoe.
I have many lovely books
for you.

23:15.820 --> 23:18.570
Would you like to see them
and learn how to read them?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.790
Wonderful. Now...

23:24.570 --> 23:28.060
Think of each letter
like a cog in a machine.

23:28.260 --> 23:29.720
Each has its own job,

23:29.920 --> 23:32.460
and together,
they work to create a word.

23:32.660 --> 23:36.020
The same way a machine creates
a box or a swath of fabric.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.240
Shall we begin?
[murmurings]

23:39.800 --> 23:41.280
Alright.

23:45.030 --> 23:47.780
- Margaret Mehar.
Doesn't ring a bell.

23:47.980 --> 23:49.640
See, that's interesting.

23:50.510 --> 23:54.260
'Cause your newspaper
had a field day with her story
12 years ago.

23:54.460 --> 23:56.220
Oh, right, right, right.

23:56.420 --> 23:59.570
Right. The harlot got herself
all chopped up
down in the Devil's Elbow.

23:59.770 --> 24:02.040
- She's a maid,
not a prostitute.

24:02.520 --> 24:03.970
A heinous act,

24:04.170 --> 24:07.140
more deplorable than the murder
of Louis of Orléans.

24:08.490 --> 24:11.370
B-b-but the murderer
was caught and hanged.

24:11.570 --> 24:13.800
- A pastor, I think.
- Yes.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.800
Andrew May... Sr.

24:16.620 --> 24:19.420
His son still continues
his godly work today.

24:19.620 --> 24:21.590
- If you say so.
I wouldn't know.

24:21.790 --> 24:24.160
- What can you tell me
about her murder?

24:24.360 --> 24:27.300
- Wouldn't your time
be better spent

24:27.500 --> 24:32.340
solving the half-dozen murders
plaguing Devil's Elbow right now

24:32.540 --> 24:36.000
rather than something
from a fucking decade ago?

24:36.200 --> 24:38.520
- You see, I believe
they're all connected.

24:39.780 --> 24:41.440
And so does Dr. Israel.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.750
- Mm. Our dear friend
Melanda Israel

24:43.950 --> 24:47.050
is very comfortable
casting aspersions on others

24:47.250 --> 24:49.090
when in point of fact...

24:49.740 --> 24:52.060
...she's the one holding
all the sharp knives.

24:52.260 --> 24:55.540
- You're saying, then,
that Dr. Israel's that one
that killed Margaret Mehar?

24:55.740 --> 24:59.980
- I told you, I don't know shit
about her murder.
I barely remember the woman.

25:00.180 --> 25:03.070
- She was a domestic servant
under the employ
of the Botticelli sisters.

25:03.270 --> 25:05.460
Th-they threw a party
a week before--

25:05.660 --> 25:07.420
- A party I was at.
Yes, I remember.

25:07.620 --> 25:10.470
But do I remember the wench
who served me food and drink

25:10.670 --> 25:13.520
among the many parties
I've been to over the years?

25:13.720 --> 25:15.740
No. That's absurd.

25:15.940 --> 25:18.090
- Of course,
I remember Margaret.

25:18.290 --> 25:20.570
And if Basil,
Lothario that he is,

25:20.770 --> 25:23.480
is suggesting he doesn't...
[chuckling]

25:23.680 --> 25:24.700
then...

25:24.900 --> 25:26.300
Then what?

25:27.130 --> 25:28.520
He's lying.

25:30.440 --> 25:34.670
The night of the party,
held in my honour
to celebrate my world tour,

25:34.870 --> 25:38.240
Basil asked me
to put a spell on her.

25:38.440 --> 25:39.840
A spell.

25:40.490 --> 25:43.190
- He wanted Margaret
to be publicly humiliated.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.290
- That lying prick!
It was all Georges.

25:46.490 --> 25:50.380
H-he wanted
to use her to show off
some new-mind control trick.

25:50.580 --> 25:53.510
- Well, you suddenly seem
to remember her very well.

25:53.710 --> 25:55.780
I remember...

25:55.980 --> 25:58.950
because it was all
in such very poor taste.

25:59.150 --> 26:02.470
But nobody ever died
from embarrassment.

26:03.170 --> 26:06.040
- Basil was obsessed
with Margaret.
- Obsessed enough to kill her?

26:07.470 --> 26:10.570
- Well... I don't know
how it played out,

26:10.770 --> 26:12.740
if it played out.

26:14.050 --> 26:17.400
I was in Montreal
when she cast off
her mortal coil.

26:18.050 --> 26:19.920
Did you murder Margaret Mehar?

26:21.840 --> 26:22.890
No.

26:23.090 --> 26:24.800
Mr. Garvey...

26:25.320 --> 26:27.810
...both Dr. Israel
and Georges Rondeau
have accused you--

26:28.010 --> 26:29.980
I'm sure they have.

26:30.180 --> 26:31.940
Because they are desperate.

26:32.140 --> 26:34.860
They can accuse me
until the cows come home.

26:35.060 --> 26:38.820
I had nothing to do with
that unfortunate woman's death.

26:39.020 --> 26:42.600
But aren't you missing
the obvious here once again?

26:43.990 --> 26:47.520
Maybe the one killing everybody
is a certain holy man

26:47.720 --> 26:50.520
seeking revenge
for his father's death.

26:52.210 --> 26:53.620
Now...

26:53.820 --> 26:55.970
either charge me with murder,

26:56.170 --> 26:58.180
based on actual evidence...

27:01.400 --> 27:03.450
...or let me go.

27:03.650 --> 27:05.230
T is for...?

27:06.450 --> 27:10.060
Trumpet. Yes!
Does everyone see the T
and the trumpet?

27:10.620 --> 27:14.630
Now, can anyone tell me
which angel plays the trumpet?

27:15.240 --> 27:17.470
- Why are you lot out here?
It's 10 past.

27:17.670 --> 27:23.560
Get back to work or the boss'll
dock you all a day's wages.
Let's go. Go! Hustle up!

27:23.760 --> 27:26.390
- It's a crime,
keeping these children
from an education.

27:26.590 --> 27:28.210
They're learning about life.

27:29.210 --> 27:32.610
I got my son this job
and my family's damn lucky
I did.

27:32.810 --> 27:34.520
Well, then shame on you.

27:36.610 --> 27:40.010
- What the fuck d'you say?
- Now, now, please,
let's keep things civil. Hmm?

27:40.210 --> 27:42.930
- Here's how it works.
Most of us need to earn money.

27:43.130 --> 27:45.620
Alright? That's something
you might not understand, huh?

27:45.820 --> 27:49.370
Hired help, posh clothes,
meat three days a week.

27:49.570 --> 27:52.980
- Friend, you're reacting
rather harshly to this good
lady's valid concerns.

27:53.180 --> 27:56.110
- I'll not be lectured to by
someone who doesn't understand
how we scrape by down here.

27:56.310 --> 27:58.460
- But I do.
That's why I'm here.

27:58.660 --> 28:00.940
I'm here to better your lives
and your children's lives.

28:01.140 --> 28:03.680
- We are all accountable
in the eyes of the Lord.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.650
Whoever stops his ears
at the cry of the poor,

28:06.850 --> 28:09.430
he will also cry out,
but shall not be heard.

28:09.630 --> 28:12.290
- You think the Lord cares
about what happens to us?

28:12.900 --> 28:14.780
We'll use this for tinder.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.910
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Sir!

28:18.470 --> 28:21.790
I will not have you speaking
this way in front of a lady.
- Pastor.

28:21.990 --> 28:24.180
Oh, you won't, huh?

28:24.790 --> 28:27.140
Am I not speaking to a lady?

28:27.340 --> 28:29.010
- Pastor, let us leave here
at once!

28:29.920 --> 28:31.540
Listen to your wench.

28:31.740 --> 28:34.060
I know you,
who you come from.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.670
Your father's hunting grounds
are closed for good.

28:38.890 --> 28:41.280
- [grunting]
- Pastor!
- Ah!

28:41.800 --> 28:44.250
- Please, please stop this!
Stop this!

28:44.450 --> 28:47.690
- [stabbing]
- Leave the judgment to God
and the Widow.

28:47.890 --> 28:49.980
[grunting]
[groaning]

28:51.730 --> 28:53.780
- [gasping softly]
- Pastor, are you alright?

28:53.980 --> 28:55.870
- Ah..
- Pastor?!
[Regina gasping]

28:56.070 --> 28:57.780
Pastor.
[groaning]

28:57.980 --> 29:00.390
Pastor! Pastor! Please help!!!

29:00.590 --> 29:03.210
Someone please! No.
[sobbing]
Help!

29:04.830 --> 29:08.660
- Reopening a closed case...
is a very difficult
and lengthy process,

29:08.860 --> 29:11.360
as I'm sure
you can well imagine.

29:11.560 --> 29:14.840
And I can't do that
without ironclad evidence.

29:15.040 --> 29:17.060
- I understand.
- Good.

29:17.260 --> 29:19.880
Then you must understand
the predicament that I'm in.

29:22.670 --> 29:25.020
I believe you
about Margaret Mehar.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.810
But I don't matter.
It's the Attorney General
who matters.

29:29.010 --> 29:32.470
And if I'm going to ask him
to reopen this case

29:32.670 --> 29:36.510
and charge the richest
and most powerful man
in this city...

29:37.420 --> 29:39.170
...I need your help.

29:39.370 --> 29:41.780
I need proof
that Basil killed her.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.390
- I wasn't present when
the murder actually happened.

29:48.260 --> 29:50.050
Margaret's body
was delivered to me.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.870
Afterwards.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.060
Arranged with Basil.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.710
- And Georges Rondeau?
Where does he fit into all this?

29:56.910 --> 30:01.410
- As far as I know,
he's like myself...
an accessory to the crime.

30:01.610 --> 30:05.800
- And I can count on you
to profess all this
in a court of law?

30:09.370 --> 30:11.510
- Doctor, your testimony
is all that I have.

30:11.710 --> 30:13.680
The Widow may spare me...

30:15.850 --> 30:17.380
...but he won't.

30:18.460 --> 30:20.260
[dramatic music]

30:20.460 --> 30:21.950
[panting]

30:22.990 --> 30:25.210
- Pastor May has been stabbed.
- What?

30:26.560 --> 30:29.480
Are you...? Wh-where is he now?
Is he alive?

30:29.680 --> 30:33.880
- We... we had words with a man
and he stabbed Andrew
in the stomach.

30:34.080 --> 30:37.320
- Okay, I'll have one of
my officers head to the scene.
- No, no!

30:37.520 --> 30:39.540
I-I don't care!
He needs Dr. Israel!

30:39.740 --> 30:42.110
- If he was stabbed
in the stomach,
it could be very bad.

30:42.300 --> 30:45.020
- You need to release her now.
- Mrs. Simcoe, I cannot just--

30:45.220 --> 30:48.850
- This is life and death!
She is the best surgeon
in this entire city.

30:49.050 --> 30:52.980
- Please let me go to him.
Let me do something good
for once.

30:56.330 --> 30:58.820
I need to locate the pancreas.
Palpate the splenic artery,

30:59.020 --> 31:02.640
then clamp it off so I can find
the source of all this blood.

31:05.210 --> 31:07.130
There you are,
you little bastard.

31:07.330 --> 31:10.520
Okay. I need you to pass me
that clamp right there.

31:10.720 --> 31:15.040
Pass me that clamp right there.
On the left. Other left.

31:20.130 --> 31:23.320
- Should I be getting you
a nurse?
- No, I got it from here.

31:23.520 --> 31:26.850
But this is gonna take hours,
Detective,
so do what you need to do.

31:27.050 --> 31:30.450
I'll be here when you get back.
[Kenneth sighing]

31:35.890 --> 31:37.600
[Basil growling]

31:37.790 --> 31:40.250
Let me the fuck out of here!

31:40.450 --> 31:42.470
- Yes,
because that's going to work.

31:42.670 --> 31:45.040
But if it doesn't, try it again,
this time louder.

31:45.240 --> 31:47.560
- Fuck you,
you backstabbing invert!

31:47.760 --> 31:49.870
- Backstabbing?
I did nothing of the sort.

31:50.070 --> 31:52.920
- Oh, he told me!
You said you think
I killed Margaret.

31:53.110 --> 31:54.730
You did.

31:55.560 --> 31:57.050
You did kill her.

31:57.250 --> 32:00.260
And because of that,
we are all fucked.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.400
- You keep your pretty mouth
shut.

32:05.310 --> 32:07.930
You understand?
You do as I say.

32:08.130 --> 32:10.010
Oh... or what?

32:11.190 --> 32:14.500
- Or you will be reunited
with your ball-biting love,
Terrence,

32:14.700 --> 32:18.580
and get your asses reamed
in hell itself.

32:29.590 --> 32:32.910
- One of my favourites.
As a thank-you.

32:33.110 --> 32:34.910
The tickets have sold very well.

32:35.110 --> 32:39.530
- Oh, well, I have sold out
shows from San Francisco
to Marrakech.

32:39.730 --> 32:42.040
- And don't I know it.
[Georges laughing]

32:43.780 --> 32:45.660
So...

32:45.860 --> 32:48.360
this parlour trick you do,

32:48.560 --> 32:50.800
messing with people's brains...

32:51.000 --> 32:52.750
It's not so crude.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.720
- You make them think things...
do things.

32:56.920 --> 32:59.460
Like that maid, Margaret,
the other night.

32:59.660 --> 33:01.550
- Hypnosis.
[laughing]

33:01.750 --> 33:05.940
The metaphysical art
borne from the mind of
the Persian physician Avicenna,

33:06.140 --> 33:08.950
known by its Arabic name
al-Walm al-Amil--

33:09.150 --> 33:12.860
- Yes, yes, yes, whatever.
I you to, um...

33:13.810 --> 33:16.380
- Hypnotize.
- ...Margaret again.

33:17.250 --> 33:19.600
This time,
I want it to be permanent.

33:20.470 --> 33:22.870
Is that something you can do?

33:23.070 --> 33:24.780
Oh, well...

33:25.390 --> 33:28.100
...that depends
on what exactly you want done.

33:28.300 --> 33:29.880
If you just want
to sleep with her,

33:30.080 --> 33:31.880
it would be easier
to make you a tonic.

33:32.080 --> 33:34.800
She won't remember
anything you do. Guaranteed.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.880
It's not that. No, I just...

33:37.880 --> 33:41.010
I want to wipe something...
from her mind.

33:43.490 --> 33:44.890
Something?

33:45.800 --> 33:47.330
What thing?

33:47.530 --> 33:50.150
Can you do it... or not?

33:52.330 --> 33:54.730
- There is something
I could try...

33:54.930 --> 33:58.610
I've been wanting to try.
For a price, of course.

33:58.810 --> 34:00.380
Money is no object.

34:01.250 --> 34:03.520
It might work, but...

34:03.720 --> 34:08.170
but it requires taking her
to the brink of death itself
and then back again.

34:09.650 --> 34:13.100
She may not survive.
Are you willing
to take that chance?

34:13.300 --> 34:15.350
- I'm afraid
it's her only option.

34:45.730 --> 34:48.210
[grunting]

34:49.520 --> 34:51.310
- [crying out]
- St-stop it!

34:51.510 --> 34:53.360
[crying out]
Stop it!

34:53.560 --> 34:56.360
- We're just getting started!
It's time you learn--

34:56.560 --> 34:58.230
Ah! Fuck!
[grunting]

34:58.430 --> 35:00.440
[exclamations]

35:02.570 --> 35:03.710
Fuck.

35:10.280 --> 35:14.420
- I hope the Widow finds you
and turns you inside out,

35:14.620 --> 35:16.630
you classless bourgeois fuck!

35:23.330 --> 35:24.810
[gasping softly]

35:37.570 --> 35:38.960
Oh, jeez!

35:43.830 --> 35:46.450
If I don't give him
a transfusion....

35:46.650 --> 35:49.280
and sew him back up,
he will die.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.760
No, pl-please. I beg you.

35:51.960 --> 35:54.370
[breath hitching]
He's innocent.

35:54.570 --> 35:56.540
He's done nothing wrong.

35:58.670 --> 36:00.330
Let me finish.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.500
Then...

36:04.460 --> 36:07.680
...you can do whatever it is
you came here to do.

36:54.860 --> 36:56.950
[wincing]

37:12.050 --> 37:14.280
If he thought I let you in...

37:14.480 --> 37:16.140
He doesn't have a choice.

37:17.190 --> 37:19.670
I'll make sure Mr. Garvey knows
you didn't either.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.940
[bell tolling]

38:07.370 --> 38:09.850
- I turned myself in
to the police.

38:12.550 --> 38:14.240
For what I did...

38:15.590 --> 38:17.250
...to Margaret Mehar.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.990
And one way... or another...

38:25.080 --> 38:27.600
...I will face the consequences
of my actions.

38:33.310 --> 38:35.000
And my testimony...

38:37.010 --> 38:39.960
...will make sure
that those directly responsible
for Margaret's death...

38:41.050 --> 38:42.750
...hang for it.

38:46.230 --> 38:47.930
[clattering]
There.

38:48.410 --> 38:49.930
Done.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.680
[sighing]

39:23.010 --> 39:25.660
I can sleep in the surgery
on a cot.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.590
I won't go anywhere.
You have my word.

39:28.790 --> 39:30.840
Ahem. Except...

39:31.670 --> 39:33.720
...and I hate to have
to remind you of this, Doctor,

39:33.920 --> 39:37.460
but the Widow
is stalking everyone involved
with Margaret Mehar's death.

39:47.680 --> 39:50.910
- She paid me a visit...
while I was operating.

39:51.110 --> 39:54.740
- What?
What, she was here with you?!
What'd she do?

39:54.940 --> 39:57.830
She... watched me operate...

39:58.960 --> 40:00.970
...and then she left me...

40:01.170 --> 40:02.610
unmolested.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.710
The Widow does not want me,
Superintendent.

40:05.910 --> 40:07.970
- How could you possibly
know that?

40:08.170 --> 40:09.750
I know that because...

40:11.970 --> 40:15.580
...though I disrespected
Margaret Mehar's corpse...

40:17.240 --> 40:19.370
...I am not the one
who killed her.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.590
<i>I'd seen Margaret</i>
<i>at the Botticellis'.</i>

40:23.720 --> 40:26.300
<i>But once she was dead,</i>
<i>Margaret became...</i>

40:26.500 --> 40:28.390
<i>much more interesting.</i>

40:28.590 --> 40:32.700
<i>She was a fresh specimen,</i>
<i>not a rotting corpse,</i>

40:32.890 --> 40:34.600
<i>not old and decrepit.</i>

40:35.210 --> 40:37.220
<i>She was young.</i>

40:37.420 --> 40:40.090
<i>And I wanted to learn</i>
<i>everything I could</i>
<i>about human bodies.</i>

40:40.290 --> 40:44.270
<i>I wanted to see all the things </i>
<i>I'd never been able to properly</i>
<i>explore in school,</i>

40:44.470 --> 40:46.740
<i>on corpses</i>
<i>I could never afford to buy.</i>

40:48.180 --> 40:50.790
<i>I wanted to see organs</i>
<i>and systems and ligaments.</i>

40:51.840 --> 40:54.140
<i>Her death was a gift for me.</i>

40:54.660 --> 40:56.710
<i>She was mine to unwrap.</i>

40:57.710 --> 41:00.290
<i>I learned things</i>
<i>that made me a better doctor,</i>

41:00.490 --> 41:03.200
<i>but they didn't make me</i>
<i>a better human being.</i>
[cutting]

41:03.400 --> 41:05.250
<i>I left her body</i>
<i>in a public place,</i>

41:05.450 --> 41:08.810
<i>as demanded by Basil,</i>
<i>where it could be discovered.</i>

41:09.720 --> 41:14.380
<i>Her death had to look violent</i>
<i>and ugly.</i>

41:16.080 --> 41:18.690
<i>It had to entice the public...</i>

41:19.600 --> 41:21.430
...to demand justice.

41:22.130 --> 41:25.610
- Justice that would end
in the stringing up
of an innocent man.

41:30.440 --> 41:32.700
I will do as you ask.

41:33.790 --> 41:37.190
I will testify
in the highest court of the land

41:37.390 --> 41:39.840
that Basil Garvey ordered
the death of Margaret.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.150
It's my duty.

41:46.980 --> 41:49.020
One I should've performed
years ago.

41:51.460 --> 41:53.990
- I'll assign a detail
to guard you.
- It's not necessary.

41:54.190 --> 41:57.070
- To keep the Widow out...
and you in.

42:17.530 --> 42:21.750
- All our fighting proves
is that you're as much
of a bastard as I am.

42:25.490 --> 42:27.150
[sighing]

42:27.840 --> 42:29.460
Georges...

42:29.660 --> 42:32.510
we have to team up
if we're gonna survive
The Widow.

42:32.710 --> 42:35.030
We have to be smart,
we have to prepare.

42:35.230 --> 42:39.030
We... could start
by you fucking untying me.

43:03.580 --> 43:05.450
- Tell me something,
my old friend.

43:07.670 --> 43:09.760
How do you prepare
to fight a ghost?

43:11.320 --> 43:13.460
- What the hell
are you talking about?

43:15.890 --> 43:18.370
[footsteps]
It's about bloody time!

43:24.900 --> 43:28.210
- You can go. For now.
Do not leave town.

43:28.780 --> 43:31.950
- I hope you're not offended
if I don't thank you
for the stay.

43:34.080 --> 43:37.570
- Enough of the niceties.
Get me the hell outta here.

43:39.520 --> 43:41.830
Open the goddamn door!

43:42.570 --> 43:44.400
I think not.

43:45.880 --> 43:47.410
What did you say?

43:47.610 --> 43:50.410
- Well, you're a risk,
certain to flee if freed.

43:52.410 --> 43:54.640
- I'm a risk
if you keep me here.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.680
- And you will stay here,
in the best interests
of the public,

43:57.880 --> 43:59.680
while I compile a case
against you.

43:59.880 --> 44:01.680
One that will see you hanged.

44:05.120 --> 44:06.810
This is now personal.

44:08.120 --> 44:11.000
- I'm just doing my job.
- No, no, I mean...

44:11.200 --> 44:12.920
for me...

44:13.110 --> 44:15.400
this is now personal for me.

44:15.600 --> 44:18.050
- Your threats may have worked
against Superintendent
Kashtinsky--

44:18.250 --> 44:22.140
- Money and ego-stroking worked
on Kashtinsky.

44:22.340 --> 44:24.140
But you?

44:24.340 --> 44:27.230
You won't be satisfied
until I destroy you.

44:27.430 --> 44:29.540
Or until you destroy yourself,

44:29.740 --> 44:32.370
because when word gets out
that you've been wasting time

44:32.570 --> 44:34.760
whacking off
to a 12-year-old murder case

44:34.960 --> 44:39.670
while letting
two likely suspects walk free
and the Widow strikes again...

44:42.150 --> 44:44.200
...you are fucked.

44:59.870 --> 45:01.820
- [knocking]
- Knock-knock-knock.

45:04.090 --> 45:06.140
Please, sister, give me peace.

45:06.340 --> 45:08.740
I pray for God
to send me gentle death.

45:10.790 --> 45:12.440
Dry your tears, sister.

45:14.320 --> 45:17.280
I have a present for you
which will ease
all of your cruel suffering.

45:17.480 --> 45:19.150
Impossible.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.580
I will never smile again.

45:22.630 --> 45:24.730
Love's arrow has been plucked
from my bosom.

45:24.930 --> 45:27.160
I am deep in the arms of misery.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.810
Ha! Alexi, come.

45:32.330 --> 45:34.200
Ah. Hmm.

45:35.290 --> 45:38.000
- Meet Alexi.
[Viviana laughing softly]

45:38.200 --> 45:39.910
He's come for a little visit.

45:41.730 --> 45:45.700
I'd like to stay and chat,
but unfortunately,
I must be off.

45:45.900 --> 45:48.090
Won't be back until late.

45:48.830 --> 45:51.270
- How late?
- Very late, my dear.

45:52.180 --> 45:53.660
- Hmm.
- Very.

45:55.660 --> 45:57.010
Hmm.

46:00.400 --> 46:02.230
The vest, off.

46:05.930 --> 46:07.760
Ah, not the hat.

46:10.150 --> 46:11.890
- You like the Ukrainian
steppes?

46:12.770 --> 46:15.340
- I would like...
to tie them up,

46:15.540 --> 46:18.860
and keep you
for a very, very long time.

46:20.860 --> 46:22.440
Come here, my darling.

46:22.640 --> 46:24.780
- Hmm.
- Your naiad awaits.

46:25.650 --> 46:27.530
- Mm.
- Mm.

46:27.730 --> 46:30.170
[Viviana giggling]
[exclaiming]

46:35.610 --> 46:37.490
[Widow]: Margaret!
[gasping]

47:32.320 --> 47:33.630
Ah!

47:34.500 --> 47:36.630
It's come to this, has it?

47:37.070 --> 47:39.210
You have a place to go?

47:39.410 --> 47:44.300
- No... but I have to flee
while Mr. Garvey is in jail.
I may not get another chance.

47:44.500 --> 47:46.730
- He's got his heart
set on you.

47:47.030 --> 47:50.860
If you leave...
he will follow you.
That's guaranteed.

47:53.560 --> 47:56.870
And he will find you
and he will be very cross.

47:59.350 --> 48:00.930
The one thing I know...

48:01.130 --> 48:04.790
is it's infinitely better
to be loved by Mr. Garvey...

48:06.970 --> 48:09.230
...than to not be loved
by Mr. Garvey.

49:44.760 --> 49:46.280
[groaning]

49:48.500 --> 49:50.170
[grunting]
[panting]

49:50.360 --> 49:51.940
[groaning]

49:52.940 --> 49:54.380
[screaming]

49:55.810 --> 49:57.640
- Ah!
[groaning]

49:59.990 --> 50:01.440
[exclaiming]

50:01.640 --> 50:03.050
[crying out]

50:03.250 --> 50:04.740
[groaning]

50:05.820 --> 50:07.610
[crying out]

50:10.700 --> 50:12.740
[screaming]

51:06.670 --> 51:07.970
Wait.

51:13.670 --> 51:15.330
No. No.

51:18.720 --> 51:21.260
No. No. No.

51:21.460 --> 51:24.080
No! No. No, no. Please.

51:24.820 --> 51:27.220
I'll... I'll testify.
[gasping]

51:27.420 --> 51:31.960
I'll testify!
I'll-I'll make sure
the killers hang!!!

51:32.160 --> 51:34.130
No!!!

51:34.910 --> 51:37.310
[screaming]

51:41.480 --> 51:43.270
[crackling]

52:09.120 --> 52:11.120
Subtitling: difuze
