WEBVTT

00:00.967 --> 00:02.768
You're watching The Simpsons.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.771
You know your life sucks.
Just get drunk
like you always do.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.540
Catch all-new episodes Sundays
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.542 --> 00:11.610
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,
Bob's Burgers <i>and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.513
What is this,
and how can I make the rest
of my life about it?

00:14.515 --> 00:15.748
Only on Fox.

00:21.621 --> 00:23.188
(gasps): What?

00:23.190 --> 00:26.191
<i>(Battle Hymn of the Republic</i>
<i>playing)</i>

00:27.660 --> 00:29.361
Isn't he magnificent?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.196
I guess.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.065
ANNOUNCER: <i>Tired of</i>
<i>the same old monuments?</i>

00:33.067 --> 00:34.700
BOTH:
You bet we are!

00:42.008 --> 00:44.076
<i>Come to Springfield.</i>

00:45.578 --> 00:48.247
We have more handicapped
parking spots

00:48.249 --> 00:51.650
for fat guys than
any non-Chicago city,

00:51.652 --> 00:54.319
and at this year's
Founder's Day Parade

00:54.321 --> 00:57.156
we will unveil our new
state-of-the-art statue

00:57.158 --> 00:59.191
of Jebediah Springfield.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.492
(fanfare plays)

01:00.494 --> 01:02.961
(robotic whirring)

01:06.699 --> 01:09.668
I founded Springfield
in 1796...

01:09.670 --> 01:11.070
(giggles)
...Billy.

01:11.072 --> 01:14.106
Wow, he's so
interactive.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.842
Here's a coupon for
one cheese pizza at

01:16.844 --> 01:19.111
(imitating Luigi):
Luigi's on-a Main-a Street.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.280
FAST-TALKING ANNOUNCER:
<i>Artist's conception of the</i>
<i>original statue design,</i>

01:21.282 --> 01:22.848
<i>which is not the</i>
<i>actual statue design.</i>

01:22.850 --> 01:24.516
<i>Your statue may vary.</i>

01:24.518 --> 01:26.251
BART AND LISA:
Can we see the statue?

01:26.253 --> 01:27.553
Please, Dad.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.188
Can we? Can we? Can we?

01:29.190 --> 01:30.889
It's not gonna be as good
as you think.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.124
Nothing ever is.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.559
But it gets us
out of the house.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.127
ALL:
Can we? Can we? Can we?

01:35.129 --> 01:37.362
Oh, wait, I'm me. Sure!

01:37.364 --> 01:39.865
(marching band playing
"Stars and Stripes Forever")

01:41.534 --> 01:44.036
This is my favorite
part of the parade,

01:44.038 --> 01:47.106
coming to the Kwik-E-Mart
to laugh at the losers

01:47.108 --> 01:50.075
who forgot to bring
parade supplies!

01:50.077 --> 01:52.144
Which reminds me,
we need parade supplies.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.479
Parade jerky.

01:53.481 --> 01:54.980
Get your parade jerky.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.448
Beef, turkey or pork.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.118
It all tastes like
a delicious shoe tongue.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.953
Ah, one tube
of sunblock.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.654
That will be $30.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.990
Once again, keeping
the bald man down.

02:04.992 --> 02:07.626
I do have a
Philadelphia 76ers hat

02:07.628 --> 02:09.161
that you could
wear for free.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.796
I'll pay! I'll pay!

02:10.798 --> 02:13.799
Leading the parade is the new
Jebediah Springfield statue

02:13.801 --> 02:17.136
that local wags have already
dubbed "Quimby's Folly."

02:17.138 --> 02:18.837
(squeaking)

02:18.839 --> 02:21.440
(Quimby's voice): Er, uh, I am
Jebediah Springfield,

02:21.442 --> 02:24.009
brought to you
by Springfield Auto Lube.

02:24.011 --> 02:27.746
Chuck, Ernie, and Arturo
are there for <i>you.</i>

02:27.748 --> 02:29.481
(crowd booing)

02:29.483 --> 02:32.451
This ad was a bad call, man.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.820
KENT: <i>And now, here comes</i>
<i>our brand-new SWAT tank.</i>

02:34.822 --> 02:37.756
NEWSWOMAN: <i>This expensive urban</i>
<i>pacification vehicle</i>

02:37.758 --> 02:39.691

02:39.693 --> 02:43.829
Gaze in wonder
at America's debt!

02:43.831 --> 02:46.999
We love you,
Officer Puff 'n' Stuff.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.433
(laughing):
Ah!

02:48.435 --> 02:50.502
Thank you!

02:50.504 --> 02:52.437
And now Springfield's
true heroes,

02:52.439 --> 02:54.706
our volunteer fire department.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.341
Wait, what?

02:56.343 --> 02:57.609
(horn honking)

02:57.611 --> 02:58.844
Hey! Hey!

02:58.846 --> 03:00.812
This is the one
good thing I do.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.181

03:02.183 --> 03:03.382
♪

03:03.384 --> 03:06.785

CROWD:
Ooh, ooh!

Lousy chili cookers!

03:09.857 --> 03:11.456
Grabbing all our glory!

03:11.458 --> 03:12.691
All right, calm down, Chief.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.960
I heard a couple of "oohs"
but that's it.

Ahs?! Oh, that's

I'm not sure, but I doubt it.

foam.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.907
Who wants juice?

04:01.909 --> 04:03.709
Who needs juice?

04:03.711 --> 04:04.943
(panting): Nobody!

04:04.945 --> 04:06.778
I-I can't control
this thing.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.080
Let me drive.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.681
Okay, okay,
I'm stuck in a hole.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.416
Oh, we're headed for
the Kwik-E-Mart.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.051
Someone call
the police!

04:13.053 --> 04:14.886
Before I die,
I would like to know

04:14.888 --> 04:16.955
just what is in these
nudie magazines.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.424
What is it, brother?

04:19.426 --> 04:21.260
An interview
with Jim Gaffigan.

04:21.262 --> 04:22.694
(tires screeching)

04:25.198 --> 04:26.598
We are still alive.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.634
Oh, there is a gods!

04:31.104 --> 04:32.904
I didn't do it.
Nobody saw me do it.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.139
You can't
prove anything.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.974
You did do it,
I saw you do it,

04:35.976 --> 04:37.809
and here's proof.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.111
HOMER: Aha!

04:39.113 --> 04:40.379
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

04:40.381 --> 04:41.647
What are you
gonna do, man?

04:41.649 --> 04:42.948
You know what I'm gonna do?

04:42.950 --> 04:44.283
I'm gonna turn this in.

04:44.285 --> 04:46.084
You can rot in jail.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.754
The only time you'll come out
is to see the dentist.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.489
No, you can't be serious.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.424
You know the kind of things
they'll do to me at the dentist?

04:52.426 --> 04:54.493
Well, there's only
one other way.

04:54.495 --> 04:58.730
You have to promise
never to prank again.

04:58.732 --> 04:59.998
Come on, man.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.633
If I don't do
these pranks soon,

05:01.635 --> 05:03.135
when I'm older,
they'll be crimes.

05:03.137 --> 05:04.403
Promise me!

05:04.405 --> 05:05.804
I promise.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.139
Say it like you mean it.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.640
I promise.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.243
Now say it like you're
talking to a dying soldier

05:11.245 --> 05:13.245
who was with you
all the way from D-Day,

05:13.247 --> 05:15.347
and you gotta take his
Saint Christopher medal

05:15.349 --> 05:16.481
back to his mother.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.616
Take me there.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.184
I promise!

05:19.186 --> 05:21.753
Whoa, calm down, Pacino.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.755
MARGE: <i>Oh,</i>

05:23.757 --> 05:26.658
Apu, it's good to see you
doing so well.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.126
I know you can't turn
your head,

05:28.128 --> 05:30.262
but you've got a great view.

05:30.264 --> 05:31.263
Oh!

05:31.265 --> 05:32.264
Are you okay?

05:32.266 --> 05:34.499
Marge, he's got
nine lives.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.335
I am a Hindu,
sir, not a cat.

05:36.337 --> 05:37.703
I have infinite lives

05:37.705 --> 05:39.805
during some of which
I may be a cat.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.273
In those I do have nine.

05:41.275 --> 05:42.274
Apu, face it.

05:42.276 --> 05:44.009
Our store is ruined.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.178
This is painful,
but I no longer want

05:46.180 --> 05:47.946
the customers to,
"Come again."

05:47.948 --> 05:49.281
I want to work
somewhere else.

05:49.283 --> 05:50.649
I see. Nurse!

05:50.651 --> 05:53.118
Transfer this man
to the mental ward.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.686
Okay.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.355
Listen to me, when I
was hit with the sign,

05:56.357 --> 05:57.356
that was a sign.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.457
I'm through.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.325
How can you
abandon me, brother?

06:00.327 --> 06:02.561
Well, the way we abandoned
our other brother.

06:02.563 --> 06:03.729
What other brother?

06:03.731 --> 06:05.564
All I remember
on that boat was you,

06:05.566 --> 06:07.866
the tiger, and the
wise, old fox.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.534
The... Oh, my God!

06:09.536 --> 06:11.737
The fox was actually Tikku.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.973
Oh, sweet, little Tikku,
I blocked out the memory.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.975
Oh, no!

06:16.977 --> 06:19.177
(crying):
Tikku!

06:19.179 --> 06:22.180
Yes, well, I have given my share
of the store to my son, Jamshed.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.416
He will rebuild
while you recuperate.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.418
Little Jamshed.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.320
Oh, how he's grown.

06:28.322 --> 06:31.890
Indeed, first in his class with
a business degree from Wharton,

06:31.892 --> 06:34.092
and he is ready to take my place
de-gunking the cheese warmer.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.527
All right, my brother.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.995
I will especially miss

06:36.997 --> 06:39.264
looking into your
tired, sunken eyes

06:39.266 --> 06:41.867
during our wordless
shift changes.
Hm.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.568
Remember when we used to nod?

06:43.570 --> 06:46.037
(crying): I do, I do.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.173
It is down to just you and me
now, store.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.075
Together, nothing can stop us.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.511
Unless they put another store
within three blocks,

06:52.513 --> 06:54.413
which I hear they plan to do.

06:54.415 --> 06:59.084
And now to lower this photo
to see what is really there.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.119
(gasps)

07:01.121 --> 07:04.423
There, we gave him
one last look at it.

07:04.425 --> 07:05.757
Roll away the photo.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.858
(wheels squeaking)

07:06.860 --> 07:08.093
APU: Quick & Fresh?

07:08.095 --> 07:09.795
Who spells "quick" with a "Q"?

07:09.797 --> 07:11.730
Hey, Uncle Apu.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.131
Jamshed?

07:13.133 --> 07:15.100
Come on, man, Jamshed
died at band camp.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.201
I'm Jay now.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.436
Yup. Check it.

07:17.438 --> 07:18.937
I just bitch-slapped
your Kwik-E-Mart

07:18.939 --> 07:21.873
into the 21st century.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.208
An upgrade?

07:23.210 --> 07:25.143
No!

07:26.712 --> 07:30.782
I will just live in the happy
past one moment longer.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.317
Ah!

07:32.319 --> 07:35.454
Disco Stu is in
denial with you.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.395
(sighs)
Check it out, Uncle A.

07:43.397 --> 07:44.496
I made this place healthy.

07:44.498 --> 07:45.997
I added softer lighting.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.266
We're even getting
a better class of robber.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.335
I'm afraid I must relieve you
of your spare cash

07:50.337 --> 07:52.771
and a nice bottle of gin.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.740
Ah, Mrs. Peel, shall we?

07:55.742 --> 07:58.176
Okay, those guys are cool,

07:58.178 --> 08:01.346
but still, Jamshed--
I-I'm-I'm sorry, Jay--

08:01.348 --> 08:02.914
I know my customers.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.150
All they want is something
they can eat while driving.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.118
I'd like a heat lamp dog,
please.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.521
Somewhere between
two and six blisters.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.590
I'm sorry,
we don't serve those anymore.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.658
They're a heart attack
shaped like a penis.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.193
Why, you, millennial...

08:15.195 --> 08:16.428
Easy, brah.

08:16.430 --> 08:18.597
Check out our olive bar.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.800
Mmm!

08:21.802 --> 08:23.935
Ha, see, he doesn't
care what he eats.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.271
He just eats things
in that location.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.974
Hey, quit talking
like I can't hear.

08:28.976 --> 08:29.975
This is my store.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.142
Mine and Sanjay's.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.512
My father's enjoying
his retirement.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.382
Bubba Watson!

08:37.384 --> 08:40.118
You are no Vijay Singh.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.988
Don't forget, my dad owned more
of this place than you did.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.557
Oh, you, I can't...
I... (sighs)

08:45.559 --> 08:49.127
Okay, can we move this
discussion into the restroom?

08:49.129 --> 08:51.363
(gasps)
You have a restroom?

08:51.365 --> 08:52.364
No.
No.

08:52.366 --> 08:55.400
I saw the whole jam from my seat

08:55.402 --> 08:57.702
<i>on top of the ATM machine.</i>

08:59.171 --> 09:01.706
You know what, I'm not gonna
scratch this last one.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.709
A smart man knows
when to walk away.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.077
Aah!

09:06.079 --> 09:08.380
(haunting ethereal music)

09:08.382 --> 09:12.417
<i>One paid-for ticket</i>
<i>and all the rest were losers.</i>

09:12.419 --> 09:15.754
<i>They say don't scrape</i>
<i>where you eat, but...</i>

09:15.756 --> 09:18.256
JAY: <i>That ticket won</i>
<i>the biggest scratcher payoff</i>

09:18.258 --> 09:19.891
<i>in Kwik-E-Mart history.</i>

09:19.893 --> 09:22.360
$25.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.361
Wow...

09:23.363 --> 09:25.263
Whoop, (laughs) don't mind me.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.001
JAY: <i>But that was the</i>
<i>last winner he saw.</i>

09:30.003 --> 09:32.871
<i>He scratched and scratched,</i>
<i>using...</i>

09:32.873 --> 09:36.007
...this.
Is that the same dime?

09:36.009 --> 09:39.077
It started
as a quarter.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.580
JAY: <i>He was hospitalized briefly</i>
<i>with scratcher's lung.</i>

09:41.582 --> 09:43.114
(coughs)

09:43.116 --> 09:45.016
<i>Each time, he paid my dad back</i>

09:45.018 --> 09:47.686
<i>with another piece</i>
<i>of the store.</i>

09:47.688 --> 09:50.088
♪

09:50.090 --> 09:53.091
So, Sanjay--
and now I-- own 80%

09:53.093 --> 09:56.861
of the Quick & Ficky-Fresh
and rising...

09:56.863 --> 09:59.197
Come on, <i>Big Bang</i>
<i>Theory</i> scratcher.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.799
Bring me back
to break even.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.234
Sheldon, Sheldon...

10:03.236 --> 10:04.936
Oh! Wolowitz.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.639
Always Wolowitz.

10:07.641 --> 10:12.377
Bart, Chalmers is sunbathing
nude under a beehive.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.779
Sorry, man, I'm retired.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.983
Now to present my manhood
to the sun.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.317
There he is.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.887
No more pranking.

10:22.889 --> 10:25.790
But...
(grunts) Do you know
how much imagination

10:25.792 --> 10:28.393
it costs to appear
in a thought bubble?

10:28.395 --> 10:30.328
Sorry, Milhouse, can't.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.764
And you know what?
A little part of me is glad

10:32.766 --> 10:35.166
that Chalmers' crotch
isn't covered in bees.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.334
Really?

10:36.336 --> 10:39.337
Let's put this good Bart
to the test.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.306
Thank God, the Department
of Homeland Security

10:41.308 --> 10:44.275
financed this cherry picker
to detangle the flag.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.276
Extend, extend.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.112
(humming)

10:47.114 --> 10:50.015
All this extending
is making me thirsty.

10:53.853 --> 10:55.787
Just smash the window,

10:55.789 --> 10:57.656
unlatch the brake,

10:57.658 --> 11:00.825
and Skinner plummets
to his hilarious doom.

11:03.262 --> 11:06.264
Now he's safer than ever.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.200
Yup, you're officially
Springfield's bad boy now.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.938
And I am up to the task.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.373
(groans): Oh!

11:16.676 --> 11:19.511
Dad, we're taking Apu
out to cheer him up.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.680
This time, please
watch the kids.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.848
How about you pay me
like a real sitter?

11:23.850 --> 11:25.483
(laughs)

11:25.485 --> 11:28.653
Another one of your
nonsensical, rambling stories.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.822
I'd like to get paid.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.724
In corn cob pipes, right?

11:32.726 --> 11:36.294
Because in 1967,
you and...

11:36.296 --> 11:37.662
Just get going.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.864
Dad, check out this "A"
I got in citizenship.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.232
Sorry, boy,
late for dinner.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.901
(moans sadly)

11:42.903 --> 11:44.869
I know exactly
how you feel, Bart.

11:44.871 --> 11:48.173
This family isn't the greatest
at recognizing achievement.

11:48.175 --> 11:51.142
Wow, now I understand why
you're so mad all the time.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.143
I really do.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.245
Aw, thank you, Bart.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.347
Hey, you want to go move
our mouths without speaking

11:56.349 --> 11:57.916
to drive Grampa nuts?

11:57.918 --> 11:59.317
I'd like that.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.488
What the...? Speak up.

12:03.490 --> 12:06.224
Oh, I guess I'll just have
to turn my hearing aid

12:06.226 --> 12:07.358
up to the max.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.860
(both yell)

12:08.862 --> 12:10.862
(yells)

12:10.864 --> 12:12.497
(both laugh)

12:14.934 --> 12:17.402
Another... Hey!
Another Chianti, please.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.738
Uh, maybe you should
slow down a little.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.040
Oh, yes, because it will
take all of my faculties

12:22.042 --> 12:25.410
tomorrow to affix my
name tag right side up.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.579
Mm-hmm!

12:27.581 --> 12:29.414
Ooh, there he is.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.050
The so-called
marketing genius

12:32.052 --> 12:34.919
who increased
revenue over 500%.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.454
Please, don't make a scene.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.356
But if you do,
bring back bread.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.259
Oh, hey, uncle.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.628
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your friends?

12:43.630 --> 12:45.597
What, are you
embarrassed by me?

12:45.599 --> 12:47.432
Um, well, yes, a little.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.633
You are ashamed of me?

12:48.635 --> 12:51.102
Me, who has been
as loyal to you

12:51.104 --> 12:53.605
as Gunga Din to
Sergeant Archibald Cutter?

12:53.607 --> 12:55.640
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.308
You're my uncle, bruh,
and I love you,

12:57.310 --> 12:59.244
but you're a
stereotype, man.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.812
(imitating Apu):
Take a penny, leave a penny.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.714
I'm Indian. I do yoga.

13:02.716 --> 13:05.817
Why don't you go back to
the Temple of Doom, Dr. Jones?

13:05.819 --> 13:08.086
Temple of Doom...
Three months I worked on that

13:08.088 --> 13:10.955
and all you can see is
my hand in one shot.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.558
Big whoop. Thank you very much,
Mr. Spielberg.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.827
And-and I say that you
are a stereotype.

13:15.829 --> 13:19.063
All you do is spout stupid,
hipster buzzwords.

13:19.065 --> 13:21.232
Swipe left on that accusation.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.767
Epic swipe left.

13:22.769 --> 13:26.604
Well, my dear nephew, this
stereotype will no longer

13:26.606 --> 13:29.941
be a troublesome potato
in your chicken vindaloo.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.676
Good luck to you.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.011
Stereotype-a?

13:33.013 --> 13:34.679
Who's a stereotype-a?

13:34.681 --> 13:36.815
That's a spicy accusation.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.249
You pipe-a down.
(whimpers)

13:43.823 --> 13:45.290
Hello? Hello, anyone here?

13:45.292 --> 13:47.826
Hey, brah, come in
and chillax.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

13:49.362 --> 13:52.363
uh, I came in for the
new issue of <i>Toes and Torsos,</i>

13:52.365 --> 13:53.498
but, uh, that can wait.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.166
What's going on here,
my friend?

13:55.168 --> 13:57.836
Oh, I lost my store
and my identity,

13:57.838 --> 13:59.938
and all I have left
is my vest here.

13:59.940 --> 14:03.842
330 million gods and not
one of them listens to me.

14:03.844 --> 14:04.843
What are you doing?

14:04.845 --> 14:06.377
I leave for one second,

14:06.379 --> 14:08.379
and you're talking like
a Mumbai riverboat pilot.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.648
Bombay! To me it will
always be Bombay!

14:10.650 --> 14:11.850
Not cool, man.

14:11.852 --> 14:12.951
Give me your vest.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.686
No, please, you
can't take it.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.655
This vest has a bullet hole
for every time I have been shot.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.023
It is my lucky vest.

14:19.025 --> 14:23.127
I love you, man, but
you're fired. "Fo-evah."

14:24.530 --> 14:26.164
(grunts)
Amateur.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.833
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Apu, you need
a visit to Moe's Tavern,

14:28.835 --> 14:30.835
your downward spiral
headquarters.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.538
Hey, we're on the cover of this
month's <i>Giving Up Magazine.</i>

14:33.540 --> 14:35.073
Check it out,

14:35.075 --> 14:36.975
that was the last issue ever.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.309
Hey, guys, this is too sad.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.645
We-we gotta help Apu
get his store back.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.213
Yeah, okay,
let's see, uh,

14:42.215 --> 14:44.515
Homer, your boy's
no good, right?
Not much.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.252
Well, why don't you ask him
to pull a prank to help Apu

14:47.254 --> 14:50.388
turn his nice, new store here
back into a rat hole?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.490
Well, I kinda
straightened him out.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.226
I was hoping he'd stay that way
till the Marines take him.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.928
You can't think
of yourself, Homer.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.163
Apu's always
been there for us.

14:59.165 --> 15:02.066
Yeah, except for that hurricane
when he jacked up the prices.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.735
Okay, so I got a
little gouge-y,

15:03.737 --> 15:06.271
but I-I don't hold the
looting against you guys.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.039
(scoffs)
Some looting.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.442
I got there late, and all that
was left was a bag of ice,

15:11.444 --> 15:13.778
and they played the clip
on CNN for a week.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.546
But I am one of you now.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.248
I sponsor your
Little League teams,

15:17.250 --> 15:18.850
and I sell you Christmas gifts

15:18.852 --> 15:20.785
at 9:00 a.m.
on Christmas morning.

15:20.787 --> 15:22.754
Yeah, that Hello Kitty
cell phone cover

15:22.756 --> 15:24.555
really saved my ass with Marge,

15:24.557 --> 15:26.925
and when I think of it,
what do we have children for

15:26.927 --> 15:30.061
if not to sacrifice them
for our needs?

15:30.063 --> 15:31.062
ALL:
Hear, hear.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.563
Hear, hear.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.366
Oh, gee,
I guess you guys

15:35.368 --> 15:38.136
are gonna have
to buy more beers.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.772

15:40.774 --> 15:41.806
HOMER (drunkenly):
<i>Ba-Bart?</i>

15:41.808 --> 15:42.974
Bart?

15:42.976 --> 15:43.975
Bart...

15:43.977 --> 15:45.643
Ba-Bart...

15:45.645 --> 15:47.779
Oh, leave me alone.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.615
Listen, boy, I need you
to do a prank for Apu.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.050
I don't get it, man.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.985
You told me to stop
pranking, and I did.

15:53.987 --> 15:54.986
And you know what?

15:54.988 --> 15:56.754
I don't miss it.

15:56.756 --> 15:59.590
Without you strangling me,
my throat is finally healing.

15:59.592 --> 16:00.792
I can sing again.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.393

16:02.395 --> 16:06.230

16:10.637 --> 16:12.103
You know what, you're right.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.104
What was I thinking?

16:13.106 --> 16:14.672
Go back to sleep.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.008
Dad.
Yes?

16:17.010 --> 16:20.411
Say someone were
to do this prank,

16:20.413 --> 16:23.514
would the prankster
receive a later bedtime?

16:23.516 --> 16:25.750
Say, 9:30?

16:25.752 --> 16:28.753
No, no, you know something, boy,
I realized I made a big mistake.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.421
I like the new,
well-behaved you.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.857
I can stop saving up for that
house near the prison.

16:32.859 --> 16:35.360
(Music for the Funeral of Queen
<i>Mary</i> by Wendy Carlos playing)

16:42.868 --> 16:44.602
Oh, I never should have bought

16:44.604 --> 16:47.372
that <i>Clockwork Orange</i> video
for his fifth birthday.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.307
I thought it would help
him tell time,

16:49.309 --> 16:51.509
and now I've awoken a monster.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.478
LISA:
You awoke me, too.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.546
I thought you were sleeping
over at Rachel's.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.449
Rachel was my imaginary friend
when I was three.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.119
Then when she was five, she
moved to White Plains, New York.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.787
HOMER: What?
I never said good-bye.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.122
Well, they wanted to leave
quickly.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.857
Her dad had been caught
in an affair.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.892
Her brother took a semester
off college,

17:07.894 --> 17:09.494
and he never went back.

17:09.496 --> 17:10.995
And her mother?

17:10.997 --> 17:12.363
LISA: Her mother's
the really sad story.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.766
Oh, I've-I've heard enough.

17:17.236 --> 17:21.205
My return to prankdom is elegant
in its simplicity.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.709
All we do is cut the power
in the store for 30 seconds.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.077
And no preservatives
in the food,

17:26.079 --> 17:28.179
so everything will
immediately go bad.

17:28.181 --> 17:32.083
Oh, it's an honor to be
the guy you explain it to.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.085
(panting): Bart, wait!

17:34.087 --> 17:36.654
I like the new you.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.424
Listen, before you flip
those circuit breakers,

17:39.426 --> 17:43.928
look deep in your sister's eyes
and tell me what you see.

17:43.930 --> 17:47.432
I see... love.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.600
Unconditional love.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.737
Which means I can do
whatever I want.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.505
D'oh!

17:54.507 --> 17:55.840
(power whirrs down,
shoppers murmur curiously)

17:57.443 --> 17:59.444
(flies buzzing)

17:59.446 --> 18:01.512
(shoppers gasping, moaning)

18:03.248 --> 18:05.917
Ah! Save us, chemicals!

18:05.919 --> 18:08.286
(sighs) At least the
mushrooms are okay.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.955
That is a wheel of brie!

18:10.957 --> 18:12.056
(gasps)

18:12.058 --> 18:13.925
(screams)

18:13.927 --> 18:16.227
Come on, this is the
cleanest place in town,

18:16.229 --> 18:17.528
and you know it.

18:18.697 --> 18:20.765
Another failed millennial.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.401
Who is a cliché now?

18:23.403 --> 18:26.070
Now to remove all signs
of our presence.

18:26.072 --> 18:28.272
(rattling)

18:31.410 --> 18:33.344
(siren wails, tires screech)

18:34.813 --> 18:37.715
Ah! We must have used it up
during the parade.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.051
Mm, it was a great parade.

18:40.053 --> 18:41.652
KRUSTY:
Aw, let's get out of here!

18:43.088 --> 18:45.490
♪ You're simply the best...

18:45.492 --> 18:47.225
♪

18:51.396 --> 18:52.997
I am sorry, nephew.

18:52.999 --> 18:56.667
I was jealous, and karma has
exacted a terrible price.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.504
Word. And I was kind
of a douche wheel.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.939
You know, even your way
of apologizing offends me.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.174
What is this?

19:03.176 --> 19:04.775
(haunting ethereal music)

19:04.777 --> 19:07.912
My ruin and my redemption.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.680
My last two dollars.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.849
I have nothing
to scratch it with.

19:13.018 --> 19:14.986
Use me, Apu.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.821
Make my life worth something.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.259
No, Uncle A,
it's a clown move, bruh.

19:21.261 --> 19:25.263
Or maybe, just maybe,
a genius clown move.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.430
Ah!

19:26.432 --> 19:27.798
Sheldon,

19:27.800 --> 19:29.433
Sheldon...

19:29.435 --> 19:30.768
(metal scraping)

19:33.038 --> 19:34.305
Three Sheldons!

19:34.307 --> 19:37.341
It is a winner,
and it is so much money,

19:37.343 --> 19:39.710
which means so many
more tickets.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.712
Precious, precious tickets.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.681
I... No, no, it's money.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.016
(kisses)

19:46.185 --> 19:47.185
(tires screech)

19:47.187 --> 19:48.319
(door bell dings)

19:48.321 --> 19:50.221
Oh, it is so good to see you.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.123
I have my store back, my friend.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.525
But I have something that
I wanted even more, you know,

19:54.527 --> 19:56.394
a feeling that I belong.

19:56.396 --> 20:00.031
I'm glad I could help
by giving my son a little nudge

20:00.033 --> 20:01.799
in the wrong direction.

20:01.801 --> 20:05.336
And now, I have something very,
very special for you, my friend.

20:05.338 --> 20:09.040
This is the legendary, jumbo,
golden Squishee cup.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.675
It will be refilled by me,

20:10.677 --> 20:13.010
for free, for the rest
of your life.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.746
Holy moly, all
those Squishees?

20:15.748 --> 20:17.515
How much is that
gonna cost you?

20:17.517 --> 20:19.417
Ah, about three bucks.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.352
(glass shattering)

20:21.354 --> 20:24.388
(chuckles)
This time it's 'cause
I let Ralph drive.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.957
I thought it was pretend.

20:31.697 --> 20:33.331
Let it never be said
I cannot admit a mistake,

20:33.333 --> 20:36.200
especially in the middle
of a recall campaign.

20:36.202 --> 20:39.870
We will now destroy the new
Jebediah Springfield statue.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.839
Chief, you may
fire when ready.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.708
(shell ricochets, whistling)

20:43.710 --> 20:44.942
(explosion)

20:45.611 --> 20:47.645
Damn it!

21:33.425 --> 21:34.892
Shh!

21:37.963 --> 21:39.964
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

21:42.834 --> 21:44.735
You've just watched
The Simpsons.

21:44.737 --> 21:47.538
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.476
MULDER:
They spy on us,

21:52.478 --> 21:54.679
tell us that makes us safer.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.814
We've never been
in more danger.

21:58.450 --> 22:01.519
I'm Special Agent Dana Scully,
and this is Special Agent
Fox Mulder.

22:06.525 --> 22:10.161
What if our work, the X-Files,
everything we've been led
to believe in is a lie?

22:10.163 --> 22:11.929
Then do something
about it.
