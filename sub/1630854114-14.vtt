Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:04.138 --> 00:05.406
Goodwin asked me

00:05.506 --> 00:07.175
to present
my own marketing campaign.

00:07.275 --> 00:08.576
Oh.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.511
I'm so sorry, Kofo.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.080
Do not be.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.347
You deserve the opportunity.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.882
But you should know,

00:14.982 --> 00:17.451
I will not be giving up
without a fight.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.287
Oh, of course.

00:19.387 --> 00:22.123
May the best
marketing executive win.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.324
I will even wish you
good luck.

00:23.424 --> 00:24.625
That is how confident I am.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.094
I'm not afraid, either.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.928
I hope you knock 'em dead.

00:28.028 --> 00:28.996
I'm going to.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.198
Right in front of you.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.665
Bring it on. Mm.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.268
Then you can watch me
hit it out of the park.

00:34.368 --> 00:37.105
Yes, we will both
be watching each other

00:37.205 --> 00:39.673
hitting it hard.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.876
I'll hit it harder.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.945
Oh, my.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.986
Good morning.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.656
You need to get up for work.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.291
If I don't shave
or brush my teeth,

00:57.391 --> 00:59.593
I can sleep for 12 more minutes.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.462
Oh, Bob.
I'm kidding.

01:01.562 --> 01:02.730
How was your shift?

01:02.830 --> 01:04.598
Very busy.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.834
I treated four broken hips.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.036
You know, I don't know
why the elderly insist

01:09.137 --> 01:10.471
on ice skating.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.340
That's so crazy,
I was just dreaming

01:12.440 --> 01:14.275
about my mom falling
through the ice.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.043
How horrible.

01:17.044 --> 01:19.113
Sure.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.782
What day is it?

01:21.882 --> 01:23.217
It is my Thursday,

01:23.317 --> 01:24.618
your Friday.

01:24.718 --> 01:27.388
I have to work all weekend.
I don't get a Friday.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.223
Good for you, Bob.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.192
Weekends are for lazy people.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.261
So then
I won't get to see you.

01:33.361 --> 01:35.463
We're doing a dry run
on the sock ovens.

01:35.563 --> 01:36.697
Oh, that's fine.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.432
I have to study anyway.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.000
And I'm giving shots
at the clinic.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.203
Look at you,
kicking the flu's ass

01:42.303 --> 01:43.804
one jab at a time.

01:43.904 --> 01:47.241
I pity any swollen ankle
that's compressed by a sock.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.310
Power couple.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.179
Have a nice day.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.546
Have a nice night.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.849
Alexa, play
"Abishola's Sleep Sounds."

01:56.884 --> 01:58.519
Chapter 46:

01:58.619 --> 02:01.655
Acute Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage.

02:28.182 --> 02:30.284
Next.
Boy, the joint's jumping.

02:30.384 --> 02:33.120
Did somebody burn down
the local Walgreens?

02:33.221 --> 02:34.555
It is flu season.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.689
The time of year where

02:35.789 --> 02:37.157
we separate the real pharmacists

02:37.258 --> 02:39.960
from those who are
just in it for the glamour.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.363
Thank you for your service.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.998
I'm just here
to pick up my mom's pills.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.102
Your wonderful insurance
covered it as usual.

02:49.203 --> 02:51.639
Do you have time
to fill out a quick survey?

02:52.473 --> 02:54.575
That is a no.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.846
Please tell Abishola
congratulations for me.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.714
For what?
Kemi told me she was

03:00.814 --> 03:03.484
the spotlight this month
in the hospital newsletter.

03:03.584 --> 03:04.818
That's great.

03:04.918 --> 03:05.986
You did not know?

03:06.086 --> 03:08.088
We've both just been so busy.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.590
She told Kemi.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.059
You would think she would
share it with her husband.

03:12.159 --> 03:13.594
We're a power couple.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.629
There's not a lot of time
for chitchat.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.130
I see.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.233
There's nothing to see, Chuey.
Everything's fine.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.669
Of course.
There's a lot going on.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.070
You have your factory.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.706
Abishola is taking
her MCAT in two weeks.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.208
Mm-hmm.

03:28.309 --> 03:31.779
Ooh, she did not
tell you that, either?

03:31.879 --> 03:33.581
Everything's fine.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.620
Hello. Thank you
both for coming.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.823
Oh, this little guy's
at capacity.
Christina, that can wait.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.826
Okay, but that's
how we got ants.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.330
I looked over each of
your marketing proposals

03:49.430 --> 03:52.633
and I've decided
we will be using Christina's.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.468
Yes! Yes!

03:54.568 --> 03:57.070
But also no.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.106
I am so sorry.

03:59.206 --> 04:01.475
You do not have
to apologize.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.077
You did have the superior idea.
She did.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.246
If anything,
Kofo should apologize

04:06.347 --> 04:08.716
for his subpar work.

04:09.717 --> 04:10.784
I'm sorry.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.219
And now you should apologize

04:12.320 --> 04:14.622
for that half-hearted apology.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.257
Maybe we should just
talk about getting

04:17.358 --> 04:18.859
to work on the proposal.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.028
Very good, Christina. Kofo,

04:21.128 --> 04:23.331
pay attention
to this work ethic.

04:23.431 --> 04:24.965
Yes, sir.
We will not let you down.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.567
I will make sure
you won't let me down.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.569
Christina,
you're in charge.

04:28.669 --> 04:32.139
Oh, I-I don't want
to step on Kofo's toes.

04:32.239 --> 04:35.242
Step on his whole body
if it gets the job done.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.878
We will get started
right away.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.980
Just as soon
as I grab this trash.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.050
I'm sorry,
but ants can find food

04:43.150 --> 04:45.052
in as little as three minutes.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.987
You should pay attention
to this as well.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.222
You may be doing it soon.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.628
Lady, it's flu season.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.030
The last place you want
to be is a hospital.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.501
Unless your toe is falling
off your body, stay home!

05:01.569 --> 05:04.838
Gloria, you were very
abrupt with that woman.

05:04.938 --> 05:05.773
Well done.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.541
We down five nurses.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.611
I don't have time for
"my bunions are flaring up."

05:11.579 --> 05:13.180
Hello.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.182
Hey.
What are you doing?

05:15.282 --> 05:17.785
Killing the germs
before they kill us.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.953
Cover your mouth,

05:20.053 --> 05:21.555
you animal!

05:22.990 --> 05:24.291
Oh, great!

05:24.392 --> 05:26.259
We lost another one.
Roslyn's out.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.261
She does that hot yoga.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.898
I'm surprised the flu was
all she caught.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.600
I suppose I have
to cover her hours.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.635
You've already taken
on three extra shifts.

05:34.735 --> 05:38.071
So? She has a Nigerian
immune system.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.409
Her love of money
kills any virus.

05:41.509 --> 05:43.143
Knock yourself out.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.812
Uh-uh!

05:44.912 --> 05:47.314
Girl!
You will not be
the death of me.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.753
Come in.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.188
I think there's
something wrong with Kofo.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.190
I asked him if he wanted
to grab some lunch,

05:57.290 --> 05:59.727
and he said
he didn't deserve to eat.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.328
Good. It is working.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.864
What's working?

06:03.964 --> 06:06.434
Part of being a good leader
is knowing how to motivate

06:06.534 --> 06:08.268
each of your underlings.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.238
Kofo performs best
when I tell him he's failing.

06:11.338 --> 06:14.074
Oh, he wasn't sad.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.943
He was just determined
to prove you wrong.

06:16.043 --> 06:16.944
Exactly.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.813
He did <i>seem</i> sad.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.214
What about me?

06:21.314 --> 06:22.816
What makes Douglas tick?

06:22.916 --> 06:25.152
I do not need a special method
with you.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.521
You are thriving
as my right-hand man.

06:27.621 --> 06:28.589
Really?

06:28.689 --> 06:30.491
I would be lost without you.

06:30.591 --> 06:33.226
Thanks, man,
that means a lot.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.696
I get it.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.466
I don't need motivation
because I'm already so good.

06:38.566 --> 06:41.469
Smart boy. Have a biscuit.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.471
Ooh.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.338
Goody?

06:45.439 --> 06:48.509
The warehouse floor seems
a little sluggish today.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.445
Perhaps they need direction
from Dorothy Willa,

06:51.545 --> 06:54.982
matriarch of the MaxDot empire.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.817
You want gentle nudge

06:56.917 --> 06:58.652
or full Dotty?

06:58.752 --> 06:59.887
Full Dotty!

06:59.987 --> 07:01.955
Hell yes.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.757
What was that?

07:03.857 --> 07:07.160
Once in a while,
you have to release the tiger

07:07.260 --> 07:10.564
so she can feast
on a lazy forklift driver.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.901
I have so much to learn.

07:14.001 --> 07:16.637
Yes, you do.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.340
Next.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.610
Uh, hello.
What are you all doing here?

07:22.710 --> 07:25.245
We heard you are
giving out free flu shots.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.447
We need injections
and as many cotton balls

07:27.548 --> 07:30.083
as we can fit in our pockets.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.785
And some free
Band-Aids.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.086
It's good to see you all.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.489
Ah, it's good to see you, too.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.457
You look utterly disheveled.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.892
Yes, Abishola.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.662
You have truly
run yourself ragged.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.230
We are so proud.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.600
What are these
granola bars for?

07:46.700 --> 07:48.936
Oh, it's for patients
who feel light-headed.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.805
I might be feeling
light-headed later.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.177
I printed out
my report card for you.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.512
Just like my blood type.

07:58.612 --> 08:01.281
His grades are
A-positive.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.551
What is this "pass"?

08:03.651 --> 08:05.118
There's no grade for PE.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.453
Either you pass or you fail.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.622
Mm-mm, try to get
some extra credits, eh?

08:08.722 --> 08:11.091
Climb a rope or something.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.192
Next.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.127
I'm sorry
to rush you off,

08:14.227 --> 08:15.495
but I have more patients.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.731
Of course,
we will get out of your hair.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.569
Ooh!

08:21.669 --> 08:24.572
Band-Aids.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.677
All right, here we go.

08:29.777 --> 08:32.980
Tell me what you think.
Just like Grandma's?

08:34.181 --> 08:35.916
Mmm.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.484
That brings back memories.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.252
I can almost hear
the old bag

08:39.352 --> 08:42.222
complain about the Puerto Ricans
moving in across the street.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.958
It is under-seasoned.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.226
You haven't even tasted it.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.495
I do not need to. You are white.

08:49.262 --> 08:52.165
So was Granny, and she sold
this stuff by the jar.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.802
Probably to other white people.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.670
Yeah.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.906
Listen, when Abishola gets home,

08:59.006 --> 09:00.407
if you two don't mind...

09:00.507 --> 09:03.176
We will leave you to your
flavorless attempt at romance.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.746
Maybe I should stick around and
sing show tunes while you eat.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.215
It'll be
like you're at the Copa.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.850
Or not.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.921
Hey, honey. What's your ETA?
I made you a special dinner.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.824
It's bolognaise!
It is bland, but I will fix it!

09:16.924 --> 09:19.126
Very helpful.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.427
No?

09:20.527 --> 09:22.062
Oh, okay.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.931
Well, I understand.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.699
I love you too. Ah.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.401
She picked up another shift.
Stupid flu.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.837
Well, that shouldn't
have to ruin the night.

09:29.937 --> 09:30.904
We'll eat with you.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.140
I had plans, but...

09:33.240 --> 09:34.441
okay.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.309
Oh, Bobby,
will you look at that?

09:36.409 --> 09:38.846
Now you got
two hot dates.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.349
Well, I guess it's better
than eating alone.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.085
No, it's not.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.361
<i>E kaale,</i> Mummy.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.229
You are up late.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.298
We ate
your romantic pasta dinner.

09:58.398 --> 09:59.833
Your husband
over-salted it,

09:59.933 --> 10:02.670
and now I have the ankles
of a hippo.

10:02.770 --> 10:03.771
Is there any left?

10:03.871 --> 10:06.106
I just said we ate it.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.508
I've had no food today.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.911
Between the one patient
that fainted

10:11.011 --> 10:14.081
and Uncle Tunde,
there were no more granola bars.

10:14.181 --> 10:17.484
We had a surprisingly
good evening.

10:17.584 --> 10:21.054
Apparently, Bob ate pasta
over at his grandmother's house

10:21.154 --> 10:22.690
every Saturday.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.693
Then they would watch
the Tigers baseball game.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.594
I've never heard
that story.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.997
I told him about sitting
with my father

10:30.097 --> 10:31.932
and watching
the Nigerian national team.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.867
I do not know
that story, either.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.704
Well, you were not at dinner,
so you do not get to hear it.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.075
Abishola?
Hmm?

10:42.175 --> 10:44.577
You must find time
to spend with your husband.

10:44.678 --> 10:47.681
Ah, we're both
very busy right now.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.316
Bob understands.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.651
The changes happen slowly.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.254
You spend less time together,

10:54.354 --> 10:57.024
then you hardly talk.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.693
And before you know it,

10:59.793 --> 11:02.495
you are living with a stranger.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.233
Is that what happened
between you and Daddy?

11:06.333 --> 11:07.768
My marriage
is none of your business.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.669
I am discussing yours.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.675
Sometimes I feel like
I'm running around so much

11:15.776 --> 11:19.079
that I'm not doing
anything as well as I should.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.949
My sweet girl...

11:22.049 --> 11:24.651
that feeling you have
is correct.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.258
Come in.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.127
Well, this janitor

11:34.227 --> 11:37.230
is officially off the clock.

11:38.098 --> 11:41.334
Let's make some marketing

11:41.434 --> 11:42.870
magic.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.004
Oh, my.

11:44.104 --> 11:47.140
By day, I'm a humble janitor,

11:47.240 --> 11:49.142
but by night...

11:52.112 --> 11:53.713
I'm a badass executive.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.548
Oh, my.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.318
Oh, stop it.
I still smell like garbage.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.388
And a hint of
cucumber melon body spray.

12:02.355 --> 12:03.824
Actually, just the cucumber.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.926
The melon was in the trash.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.361
Hey, let's work
on the couch.

12:09.797 --> 12:12.232
Hey, Kofo, before we start,
do you mind

12:12.332 --> 12:14.768
if I ask you something?
Of course.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.906
Why do you let Goodwin
treat you so badly?

12:20.273 --> 12:22.375
That is just
his way of guiding me.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.078
Spare the rod, spoil the Kofo.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.080
I don't think that's the saying.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.082
Yes, it is. There is also,

12:29.182 --> 12:30.884
"See no Kofo, hear no Kofo,"

12:30.984 --> 12:33.686
and "Dumb as a bag of Kofos."

12:34.687 --> 12:37.390
Here's another saying:
"No one can make you

12:37.490 --> 12:40.060
feel inferior
without your consent."

12:40.160 --> 12:41.829
Eleanor Roosevelt.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.663
Oh, I wish.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.933
It's actually from the movie
<i>The Princess Diaries.</i>

12:46.033 --> 12:47.167
Oh.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.102
Do not worry about Goodwin.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.237
This is just his way

12:50.337 --> 12:51.604
of motivating me to be better.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.341
By torturing you?

12:55.142 --> 12:56.443
It is tough love.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.046
When I was a child,
I was afraid of the dark.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.282
Then Goodwin locked me
in the closet for three hours.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.252
Now, I'm only
terrified of closets.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.855
Oh, my God. Okay.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.924
I'm going to give you a hug
right now, if that's okay.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.159
It is okay.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.894
Okay.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.762
I just want to say

13:15.863 --> 13:17.130
that I am here

13:17.230 --> 13:18.198
whenever you're ready to talk.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.333
Thank you.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.136
About what?

13:24.004 --> 13:26.639
You poor broken bird.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.675
Oh, my.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.482
Ah, <i>e kaasan,</i> Uncle.

13:35.582 --> 13:36.783
Abishola.

13:36.884 --> 13:37.985
Is Bob in his office?

13:38.085 --> 13:40.153
Yes. He is, in his words,

13:40.253 --> 13:43.223
"Sticking it to
some sons of bitches."

13:43.323 --> 13:45.192
Pastrami on rye.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.526
How did you know?

13:46.626 --> 13:49.696
I have the nose
of a golden retriever.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.398
I wanted to see
if we could have lunch

13:51.498 --> 13:52.665
before I go back to work.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.201
It could be a while.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.402
I just heard him say,

13:55.502 --> 13:56.669
"Listen, buddy."

13:56.769 --> 13:57.871
It sounds friendly,

13:57.971 --> 14:00.273
but I assure you, it is not.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.213
Yeah, but I told you that.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.614
What are you doing here?

14:07.714 --> 14:10.250
Lunch.
Ah, you're the best.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.385
How much longer?

14:14.621 --> 14:16.789
I have to leave soon.
I'm sorry.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.558
It's okay. I love you.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.762
Listen, buddy...

14:22.862 --> 14:25.532
Uncle, <i>o dabo.</i>

14:29.102 --> 14:31.571
Well, this worked out.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.078
Welcome, everyone.
Thank you for coming.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.447
I'd like to
present to you the...

14:40.547 --> 14:42.882
"Walk a Mile
in MaxDot" campaign.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.821
I have one question.
Yes, Goodwin?

14:48.922 --> 14:50.290
Why are you talking?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.059
Excuse me?

14:52.159 --> 14:54.027
I put Christina

14:54.127 --> 14:55.428
in charge of this project.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.931
Oh, we both contributed
equally to this campaign.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.467
Thank you for letting
him assist you.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.235
Kofo, please sit down.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.544
No.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.281
What did you say?

15:15.949 --> 15:17.217
Good.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.053
See no Kofo, hear no Kofo.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.788
That is not a real saying.

15:21.888 --> 15:22.990
Of course it isn't.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.392
I used poetic license
to motivate you.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.626
Well, I'm tired of it.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.095
I will no longer
let you belittle me

15:28.195 --> 15:29.296
or pass gas on me.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.597
It's gaslighting,

15:30.697 --> 15:31.999
but keep going.
You're doing great.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.866
Oh, no.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.268
What did you
do to him?

15:35.368 --> 15:38.105
I gave him a sympathetic
ear and a safe space.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.207
A safe space?

15:40.307 --> 15:42.842
Is that what
you're calling it now?

15:42.942 --> 15:44.044
Mom.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.478
She simply pointed out
what you've been

15:45.578 --> 15:46.879
doing to me
since we were children,

15:46.980 --> 15:48.581
and now I am triggered.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.450
What are you talking about?

15:50.550 --> 15:51.985
I brought you to this country.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.353
I gave you a job.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.921
I put a roof over your head.

15:55.022 --> 15:55.989
At what cost?

15:56.089 --> 15:57.357
Do you want to know?

15:57.457 --> 16:00.160
I have kept
very detailed records.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.694
Of course you have.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.131
Just another string you pull
to control my every move.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.665
What are you saying, Kofo?

16:05.765 --> 16:08.601
I am not a puppet. I am a man!

16:09.869 --> 16:11.138
I do not know what
has gotten into you.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.672
Now go to
your office

16:12.772 --> 16:15.375
and stay there until you are
ready to behave yourself.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.809
Maybe you should
go to your office

16:16.909 --> 16:18.511
until you are
ready to behave.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.780
This is my office, dumb-dumb.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.083
There you go,
resorting to insults

16:23.183 --> 16:24.317
when you know you are wrong.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.318
You have made me feel small

16:25.418 --> 16:26.919
for the last time, cousin.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.792
Boy, they got
some baggage.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.927
That's why you never
work with family.

16:44.971 --> 16:48.775
Bob, your alarm
is going off.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.844
Why is it so cold in here?

16:51.944 --> 16:52.879
You're cold?

16:52.979 --> 16:54.981
I'm sweating
through the sheets.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.686
Ah, honey,
you're burning up.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.922
I love you, but please
remove your clammy hand.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.025
We have the flu.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.560
I do not get the flu.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.129
I get the overtime.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.464
We're supposed
to be a power couple.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.566
I can't even
lift my arms.

17:13.666 --> 17:14.901
I suppose we're
going to have to

17:15.001 --> 17:16.269
stay home and rest.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.904
I'll get
the ice packs.

17:18.004 --> 17:20.006
I'll get a bucket
for vomit.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.777
Not happening.
Oh, God.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.014
Hey, congrats on
making the newsletter.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.549
Thank you.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.652
And I want you to make
me a romantic dinner

17:32.752 --> 17:33.820
and tell me a story

17:33.920 --> 17:35.488
you have not yet
told my mother.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.690
That's a date.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.028
This is nice.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.830
Yes, it is.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.209
I know you usually

17:56.309 --> 17:58.044
deal with Bob,
but today you are

17:58.145 --> 18:01.414
dealing with Babatunde,
and he does not play.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.450
Hello, Kofo.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.717
Hello, Uncle.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.153
I was looking for Mr. Wheeler.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.020
Ah, he is still
out with the flu.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.256
Bob asked
that I come in

18:09.356 --> 18:10.590
and sign for a package,

18:10.690 --> 18:13.426
which makes me acting CEO.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.496
What can I do for you?

18:16.596 --> 18:20.633
I was hoping to transfer
to MaxDot manufacturing.

18:20.733 --> 18:21.768
Interesting.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.836
What are your qualifications?

18:23.936 --> 18:25.972
15 years on the warehouse floor,

18:26.072 --> 18:27.940
three as co-supervisor
and one year

18:28.040 --> 18:29.409
as marketing executive.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.510
Impressive.

18:30.610 --> 18:31.844
I am hardworking,

18:31.944 --> 18:34.614
creative and some say
I light up the room.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.816
You are hired.

18:36.916 --> 18:37.850
You can do that?

18:37.950 --> 18:39.152
Read my lips.

18:39.252 --> 18:42.622
Acting C-E-O.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.624
Now,

18:44.724 --> 18:46.159
your first order of business

18:46.259 --> 18:47.860
is to get me a latte.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.496
Yes, sir.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.599
How do you take it?

18:52.699 --> 18:54.066
You are the creative one.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.369
Wow me.
