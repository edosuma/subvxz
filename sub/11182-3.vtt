ANNOUNCER: Last week George
Jefferson was having
no luck finding a location

01:12.900 --> 01:14.300
for a new cleaning plant.

01:14.367 --> 01:16.467
Until he learned that
Tom Willis had just inherited

01:16.533 --> 01:18.633
a warehouse from
his late father.

01:18.700 --> 01:22.267
You mean to tell me
that Tom owns a warehouse
over on 10th Avenue?

01:22.333 --> 01:23.867
He will now.

01:23.933 --> 01:25.267
What's he gonna do with it?

01:25.333 --> 01:26.967
Well, I don't think
he's decided yet.

01:27.033 --> 01:30.400
Oh, that's a perfect location.

01:30.467 --> 01:34.367
George's plan to get the
warehouse from Tom Willis
seemed to be going well,

01:34.433 --> 01:37.433
until the Willises' son
appeared at George's door.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.633
Alan Willis. Remember me?

01:39.700 --> 01:43.633
Oh, yeah, the white sheep
of the family.

01:43.700 --> 01:47.333
A lawyer called
about the will.
Grandpa left everything to me.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.300
I already know what
I'm gonna do
with the warehouse.

01:49.367 --> 01:50.700
You do?

01:50.767 --> 01:52.967
I'm gonna give it to you, Dad.
It's really yours anyway.

01:56.300 --> 01:57.533
Where do you think
you're going?

01:57.600 --> 02:00.867
I am going back to
New Mexico where nobody
hassles me!

02:00.933 --> 02:03.033
Oh, it's that kid.
I just don't understand him.

02:03.100 --> 02:04.633
Now that he's got
the warehouse...

02:04.700 --> 02:06.933
No, no, no, no.
You got the warehouse.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.433
-No, the will says
he can't give it to me.
-What?

02:10.500 --> 02:13.033
So, you see, my problem is...

02:13.100 --> 02:15.300
Who cares about your problem?

02:15.367 --> 02:17.567
You mean you want me to
stay here with you?

02:17.633 --> 02:18.867
I insist.

02:18.933 --> 02:21.133
I feel like I'm in
The Twilight Zone.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.667
ANNOUNCER:
It's now the next morning,

02:25.733 --> 02:29.500
and Alan Willis and George
Jefferson have been under the
same roof for one whole night.

02:29.567 --> 02:33.033
To the surprise of Louise
and Florence, all is calm.

02:33.100 --> 02:35.833
Maybe George is turning
over a new leaf.

02:35.900 --> 02:39.467
Well, if he is, I bet you
under that leaf
there's a snake.

02:41.533 --> 02:43.533
Morning, Florence.
Morning, Mrs. Jefferson.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.967
Good morning, Alan.

02:45.033 --> 02:47.333
Good morning, Alan.
What would you like
for breakfast?

02:47.400 --> 02:50.633
Oh, don't worry about me,
Mrs. Jefferson. I'll take
care of my own breakfast.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.533
Why? Don't you trust
my cooking?

02:52.600 --> 02:54.033
Well, it's not that, Florence.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.333
It's just that I like
a high energy breakfast.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.800
Well, you're gonna need all
the energy you can get once
the Mr. Jefferson you know

02:59.867 --> 03:04.100
turns back into
the Mr. Jefferson I know.

03:04.167 --> 03:07.800
Yeah, you know it's been
almost a day since he
called me 'zebra'.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.267
Are you sure we can't get
you anything, Alan?

03:12.333 --> 03:16.900
Well, I could use some
of that orange juice.

03:16.967 --> 03:19.033
I hope you don't mind me
making my own breakfast,
Florence.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.600
It's just force of habit.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.433
No, child, you can force
that habit on me anytime.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.333
Hey, Alan, my man,
good morning.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.467
How'd you sleep last night?

03:29.533 --> 03:30.633
Like a baby.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.600
Yeah? I didn't hear
you cry once.

03:34.767 --> 03:35.833
What you got there?

03:35.900 --> 03:37.833
Well, this is my own recipe.

03:37.900 --> 03:39.900
-I call it Western Wowee.
-Oh...

03:39.967 --> 03:41.933
Wanna try some?

03:42.000 --> 03:44.133
Sure. What's good enough
for my main man is good
enough for me.

03:45.867 --> 03:48.233
Mmm... Looks good.
What's in it?

03:48.300 --> 03:52.567
Well, a little orange
juice, mixed with
desiccated liver,

03:52.633 --> 03:56.067
dehydrated seaweed, and
fertile egg yolk.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.133
Is it good, George?

03:59.200 --> 04:00.867
Mmm-hmm... Hmm...

04:11.267 --> 04:12.500
(HEAVES)

04:19.400 --> 04:21.467
Well, how did you like
it, Mr. Jefferson?

04:21.533 --> 04:23.400
That was something.

04:23.467 --> 04:26.667
Man, I never tasted
nothing like that before
in my life.

04:26.733 --> 04:29.833
Western Wowee's good for you.
Pure energy.

04:29.900 --> 04:34.200
You ain't lying. It made
me run right through
the living room.

04:34.267 --> 04:36.267
Hey, Alan,
now that you and me are
alone, there's something

04:36.333 --> 04:37.833
very important I wanna
talk to you about.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.833
Well, don't you wanna finish
your breakfast first?

04:39.900 --> 04:42.800
Breakfast? No.
I don't eat much breakfast
in the morning.

04:42.867 --> 04:44.833
I gotta get up
early and get out.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.300
Yeah, me, too.

04:46.367 --> 04:48.200
I like to watch the sun rise.

04:48.267 --> 04:50.933
Sun rise? No, I ain't got
no time to be watching
no sun rise.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.233
I gotta be out there getting
a jump on my competition.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.867
But don't you ever get
tired of all that
wheeling and dealing?

04:57.900 --> 04:59.300
You got something
against work?

04:59.367 --> 05:00.600
Well, no.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.167
But I'd rather work with
my hands.

05:02.233 --> 05:04.033
Well, I work with
my hands, too.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.033
I use them to count my money.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.733
Well, you like to make money,
I like to make...

05:10.800 --> 05:11.867
A chair.

05:11.933 --> 05:13.200
What for?

05:13.267 --> 05:15.067
To sit on.

05:15.133 --> 05:16.933
No, I mean how long does
it take you to make
a chair?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.500
Oh, a couple weeks.

05:18.567 --> 05:21.433
Yeah, now see, that's dumb.
You spend all that time
making one chair,

05:21.500 --> 05:24.167
when you could work and
make enough money
to buy 50 chairs.

05:24.233 --> 05:25.900
But I don't need 50 chairs.

05:25.967 --> 05:27.767
You would if you had money.

05:27.833 --> 05:30.867
Because then you'd
have enough friends
to use the other 49.

05:32.133 --> 05:33.500
I get it.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.233
You mean if I was rich enough,
I could buy me some friends.

05:36.300 --> 05:38.700
Yeah. No, I didn't say that.

05:39.300 --> 05:40.533
Sorry.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.700
You mean that money could
buy me comfort.

05:42.767 --> 05:44.000
Yeah.

05:44.067 --> 05:45.533
-And a lot of valuable
possessions.
-Right.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.567
-And an expensive
security system.
-Yep.

05:47.633 --> 05:49.633
So you become a prisoner
in your own home.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.733
Yep. No.

05:51.800 --> 05:54.467
That is the most idiotic,
stupidest thing
I ever heard in my life.

05:54.533 --> 05:56.000
That's the trouble with
you kids of today.

05:56.067 --> 05:57.833
You think the world owes
you a living.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.700
-Oh, now wait a minute...
-And you know something?

05:59.767 --> 06:01.533
You may be right.

06:02.900 --> 06:04.267
You agree with me?

06:04.333 --> 06:07.300
Agree? I said we're two
of a kind, under the skin.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.133
Now about that warehouse...

06:10.200 --> 06:11.933
(DOORBELL RINGS)

06:12.000 --> 06:14.700
Who the hell is that?
Don't move, Alan,
I'll be right back.

06:18.633 --> 06:20.167
(OFF-KEY MUSIC)

06:22.300 --> 06:24.633
Do you know what that
song is called, Mr. J?

06:24.700 --> 06:26.067
Yeah. Awful.

06:26.133 --> 06:28.433
Uh, no. It's been driving
me crazy all morning.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.800
I just can't think
of the title.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.500
-See you around.
-Uh, no, that's not it.

06:32.567 --> 06:33.900
Hi, Mr. Bentley.

06:33.967 --> 06:36.300
Oh, Alan,
I see you're still here.

06:36.367 --> 06:38.667
You are, too.
I said goodbye once.

06:38.733 --> 06:41.267
-Hello, Mrs. J.
-Oh, hi, Mr. Bentley.

06:41.333 --> 06:43.467
Oh, you seem a bit tired
this morning.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.567
I am.

06:45.633 --> 06:47.833
Did you ever have
one of those nights when
you didn't sleep a wink?

06:47.900 --> 06:51.000
Well, actually, yes, but
I'm not the type to brag.

06:51.067 --> 06:52.900
She didn't mean that.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.000
You're right.

06:58.067 --> 07:01.533
Actually, I was awake
all night thinking about
the Help Center.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.933
Our rent is being raised,
and unless we come up
with the money,

07:05.000 --> 07:06.333
we may have to close down.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.533
Uh, what's the Help Center?

07:08.600 --> 07:11.767
Oh, it's a place where
your mother and I do some
volunteer work.

07:11.833 --> 07:15.300
Drug counseling, family
planning, job placement.

07:15.367 --> 07:16.933
Yeah, I'd like to see
that sometime.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.967
Well, you can go with
me today, if you'd like.

07:19.033 --> 07:20.933
Your mother should be there.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.033
No, he can't. Alan wants
to stay here with me.
Right, Alan?

07:23.100 --> 07:25.700
You know, I did some
fundraising in college,
perhaps...

07:25.767 --> 07:26.967
Ain't you got something to do?

07:27.033 --> 07:30.367
Well, I, I was practicing
my clavietta.

07:30.433 --> 07:31.767
Would you like me
to play something?

07:31.833 --> 07:33.500
Yeah. Far, far away!

07:35.600 --> 07:37.033
George, that wasn't very nice.

07:37.100 --> 07:39.067
Yeah, I know.

07:39.133 --> 07:41.467
Can you believe Bentley
running in here bothering us
like that?

07:41.533 --> 07:44.200
Now, back to business.

07:44.267 --> 07:47.433
Look, Weezy,
what are you doing?

07:47.500 --> 07:49.767
Making some notes for
my meeting at the Center.

07:49.833 --> 07:53.667
Can't we find any privacy
around here? Come on, Alan.

07:53.733 --> 07:55.767
Well, what do you wanna
talk about, Mr. Jefferson?

07:55.833 --> 07:57.800
Well, we'll start with
your warehouse. Now...

07:59.500 --> 08:01.067
Florence, go find
something to do.

08:01.133 --> 08:03.333
I'm sorry. I'm on my break.

08:06.033 --> 08:09.267
Break? Don't you have to
work before you
get a break?

08:09.333 --> 08:11.733
Hey, hey, relax,
Mr. Jefferson. We'll find
somewhere else to talk...

08:11.800 --> 08:13.033
Yeah...

08:15.800 --> 08:16.933
(DOORBELL RINGS)

08:17.000 --> 08:18.300
Would you get that, George?

08:18.367 --> 08:20.100
-Weezy...
-Please.
I have to finish this.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.400
(SIGHS)

08:27.033 --> 08:28.300
I have a solution.

08:28.367 --> 08:31.100
-For what?
-For Mrs. J's
fundraising problem.

08:31.167 --> 08:34.100
See we'll hold a tiddlywinks
contest and offer a prize,

08:34.167 --> 08:36.133
like $10,000.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.667
Well, if we had $10,000,

08:37.733 --> 08:39.500
we wouldn't need
a tiddlywink contest.

08:39.567 --> 08:42.433
Right. Oh...

08:42.500 --> 08:45.133
Well, perhaps I better think
on a different plane.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.100
Yeah. Try thinking on
a plane to Cuba.

08:50.633 --> 08:52.500
I have to get ready for
my meeting.

08:52.567 --> 08:55.100
Well, it's about time.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.633
Now, we can talk.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.200
Look, Alan, old buddy...

08:58.267 --> 08:59.667
(DOORBELL RINGS)

08:59.733 --> 09:01.633
-I'll get it.
-No, I'll get it!

09:01.700 --> 09:04.833
You can have it.
I ain't crazy about
opening doors no how.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.600
I've got it!

09:09.667 --> 09:10.867
Well, get out of here
before I catch it!

09:12.133 --> 09:13.833
A hot air balloon.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.167
Bentley, will you...

09:15.233 --> 09:18.867
A huge blimp,
gaily colored,
floating over the city.

09:18.933 --> 09:22.467
Yeah. And you could drop
leaflets saying,
"Save the Help Center."

09:22.533 --> 09:24.733
Yes, and we could paint
a slogan on the side
of the blimp.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.167
Look, Bentley, why don't
you and Florence go over
to your apartment and

09:27.233 --> 09:28.433
discuss this thing?

09:28.500 --> 09:30.600
-But...
-You two will make
a great team.

09:30.667 --> 09:33.633
You can supply the balloons,
and Florence
could supply the hot air.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.533
-Finally!
-I'll be right back...

09:40.400 --> 09:41.867
Come on, Tom.

09:41.933 --> 09:44.067
Oh, Helen, why should I
be the one to apologize?

09:44.133 --> 09:46.033
-Don't you love our son?
-Of course, but...

09:46.100 --> 09:47.900
Then go on in and tell
him you're sorry.

09:47.967 --> 09:49.400
-But...
-But what?

09:49.467 --> 09:53.567
But... Love means never
having to say
you're sorry.

09:53.633 --> 09:56.367
Tom, there is nothing to
be afraid of.

09:56.433 --> 09:57.733
I'm not afraid.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.133
Will you go with me?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.733
Tom, I have a meeting at
the Help Center.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.767
Besides, this is between you
and Alan. Now go on.

10:03.833 --> 10:06.700
Oh, Helen... Helen?
Helen? Wait...

10:07.900 --> 10:09.733
Alan, you gonna be
in there long?

10:09.800 --> 10:11.433
No. I'm just washing my hands.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.233
Well, could you dry
them out here?

10:13.300 --> 10:15.033
(DOORBELL RINGS)

10:15.100 --> 10:17.200
Damn that Bentley!
I'm gonna get rid of that
turkey for good.

10:17.267 --> 10:20.100
I think your idea stinks!

10:20.167 --> 10:22.767
So do I. But Helen made
me come down.

10:22.833 --> 10:24.400
Willis, what do you want?

10:24.467 --> 10:25.733
Is Alan here?

10:25.800 --> 10:27.067
Yeah, but we're talking.

10:27.133 --> 10:29.167
Oh, well then if you two
are busy,
I can come back later.

10:29.233 --> 10:30.267
Good idea.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.267
Oh, hi, Dad.
Are you here to see me?

10:32.333 --> 10:35.633
Why, uh, yes. I mean, no.
I, I mean, yes.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.933
Why don't you come back
when you make up
your mind?

10:38.967 --> 10:40.333
About last night, Alan...

10:40.400 --> 10:42.667
Aw, forget about it, Dad.
You don't have to apologize.

10:42.733 --> 10:45.167
Oh, good. Neither do you.

10:45.233 --> 10:48.500
-We both got carried away.
-Yes, we did, didn't we?

10:48.567 --> 10:51.100
Oh, I hope you won't
resort to calling me
a fool again.

10:51.167 --> 10:54.400
Well, I don't exactly get
a thrill out of being
called a bum.

10:54.467 --> 10:57.467
Alan, all I was trying to
say is that I, I'd like
to see you do something

10:57.533 --> 10:58.900
useful with your life.

10:58.967 --> 11:00.767
Dad, you're starting up again.

11:00.833 --> 11:03.400
Hey, Willis, can't you
see you're upsetting the kid?

11:03.467 --> 11:05.167
I'm upsetting him? What
do you think he's doing to me?

11:05.233 --> 11:06.933
-Well, look, he...
-I'm only thinking of your
own good...

11:07.000 --> 11:08.967
(YELLING OVER EACH OTHER)

11:10.567 --> 11:12.933
(YELLING) Hold it!

11:13.000 --> 11:14.500
What is the matter with
you two?

11:14.567 --> 11:15.733
This is your kid.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.533
Your own flesh and blood.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.433
He's got the same name, and in
this case, the same color.

11:23.433 --> 11:26.333
Now if you two had
any sense at all, you'd
shake hands, make up, and

11:26.400 --> 11:29.700
you Willis, would go the hell
back upstairs to your own
apartment where you belong.

11:30.767 --> 11:33.033
He's right.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.200
-I'm sorry.
-Me, too.

11:35.267 --> 11:38.267
Your mother and I would
like you to come home with us.

11:38.333 --> 11:40.800
Great. He'll be up in
about 20 minutes.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.733
Well maybe we can talk
more over lunch.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.867
-Oh, that sounds good.
-Come back around noon.

11:44.933 --> 11:48.000
In fact, I'm having lunch
today with Ted Bennett.

11:48.067 --> 11:49.467
He'd be a perfect guy
for you to meet.

11:49.533 --> 11:51.000
Why's that?

11:51.067 --> 11:53.200
He's in real estate.
He could advise you what
to do on the warehouse.

11:53.267 --> 11:55.533
-Oh now, Dad...
-Well you do wanna get top
dollar for it, don't you?

11:55.600 --> 11:57.567
Dad, I really don't care
about getting top dollar.

11:57.633 --> 12:00.500
Yeah, Willis, it's about
time you learn that money
ain't everything.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.067
Of course money isn't
everything when you don't
have to earn your own.

12:07.133 --> 12:08.967
Well, you really don't
understand me at all,
do you?

12:09.033 --> 12:11.233
I understand you perfectly.
You'd rather mooch off
of Jeffersons

12:11.300 --> 12:12.767
than pay your own way.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.167
Well, it beats living
with you and arguing
all the time.

12:15.233 --> 12:17.367
All right.
Why don't you stay here for
the rest of your life?

12:17.433 --> 12:20.233
No, no, no, no, no.
He ain't gonna stay that long.

12:21.433 --> 12:23.367
I just might do that!

12:23.433 --> 12:24.700
Hey, man, let's not be hasty.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.167
Okay, George, he's all yours.

12:27.233 --> 12:29.367
Hey, Willis, what...

12:29.433 --> 12:31.500
Oh, it's no use,
Mr. Jefferson.

12:31.567 --> 12:33.367
But thanks for trying to help.

12:33.433 --> 12:36.300
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Well, what are friends for?

12:36.367 --> 12:38.433
In fact, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.933
You know,
I owe you an apology.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.033
Apology?

12:41.100 --> 12:43.300
Yeah, I've misjudged you.

12:43.367 --> 12:45.667
I didn't really think you
wanted to help settle things
between me and my dad.

12:45.733 --> 12:47.067
Well, yeah, but...

12:47.133 --> 12:49.433
You know, when you first
asked me to stay here,

12:49.500 --> 12:52.233
I thought you were maybe
just gonna hustle me
for the warehouse.

12:52.300 --> 12:54.833
Me hustle you? My main man?

12:56.500 --> 12:59.133
Well, I know I was wrong then.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.467
But, well, you took me in
and made me feel
like one of the family.

13:02.733 --> 13:04.367
You're all right,
Mr. Jefferson.

13:05.267 --> 13:07.133
How about it, brother?

13:07.667 --> 13:09.133
Right, brother.

13:10.700 --> 13:13.200
Now what did you wanna
say about the warehouse?

13:13.267 --> 13:15.167
Say? Uh...

13:16.367 --> 13:18.633
Oh, I'm just
happy that you got it.

13:29.467 --> 13:31.167
I'm leaving now.

13:31.233 --> 13:33.533
You two can have all
the privacy you want.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.633
Hey, look, Weezy, before you
go I gotta talk to you
in the kitchen.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.500
-Excuse me a minute, Alan.
-Oh, but, George...

13:38.567 --> 13:40.267
Hey, hey, hey...

13:43.300 --> 13:45.567
Now listen, Weezy,
we're a family, right?

13:47.333 --> 13:49.467
And families stick together,
right?

13:50.367 --> 13:51.900
I mean, like the Waltons.

13:51.967 --> 13:53.633
Every time something happens
to one of them honkies,

13:53.700 --> 13:55.667
the whole family jumps in
to help out, right?

13:57.733 --> 13:59.767
I'm gonna be late for
my meeting.

13:59.833 --> 14:02.400
Look, Weezy, you always up
there at that Help Center
helping other people.

14:02.467 --> 14:03.933
Now I need me some help.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.633
What kind of help do you need?

14:05.700 --> 14:08.367
I need help getting a place
for my new cleaning plant.

14:10.233 --> 14:12.267
George, I can't help
you with that.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.667
You can talk to Alan.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.500
Huh?

14:15.567 --> 14:17.533
Look, Alan's warehouse
would be perfect for
my new cleaning plant.

14:18.867 --> 14:21.600
Oh, so that's it.

14:21.667 --> 14:25.900
The only reason you wanted
Alan here is because he
inherited a warehouse.

14:25.967 --> 14:29.800
And all this time you
were just fattening him
up for the kill.

14:29.867 --> 14:32.300
"Alan, oh please
stay with us."

14:32.367 --> 14:36.033
"Alan, my man.
How'd you sleep last night?"

14:43.500 --> 14:46.033
Now you want me to do
your dirty work.

14:46.100 --> 14:50.267
The question is, George, how
did you sleep last night?

14:50.333 --> 14:53.767
Look, Weezy, I ain't
doing nothing dishonest.
I ain't trying to cheat him.

14:53.833 --> 14:57.533
In fact, I'm doing him a favor
by taking that old raggedy
warehouse off his hands.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.600
Then why don't you just
talk to Alan yourself?

14:59.667 --> 15:00.800
I can't!

15:00.867 --> 15:03.033
-Why not?
-Well, because...

15:03.100 --> 15:07.133
Because you're better at that
kind of stuff than I am,
Weezy. He'll listen to you.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.800
Oh, George, I don't know...

15:08.867 --> 15:11.500
Look, Weezy, I'm not
doing this just for me.
I'm doing it for us.

15:15.867 --> 15:17.767
Okay, George,
I'll talk to him.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.333
I knew I could count on
you, Weezy!

15:20.400 --> 15:23.633
But once he decides what
he's going to do with
that warehouse,

15:23.700 --> 15:25.267
I don't want you throwing him
out of here.

15:25.333 --> 15:26.567
Oh, of course not, Weezy.

15:26.633 --> 15:28.600
Look, Alan can stay here
as long as he wants.

15:28.667 --> 15:30.733
-Promise?
-I promise.

15:30.800 --> 15:34.867
But I don't think he's gonna
wanna keep hanging around old
people like you and Florence.

15:39.267 --> 15:41.567
What about you, George?

15:41.633 --> 15:43.433
I'm used to you and Florence.

15:47.533 --> 15:49.033
You're incredible.

15:49.100 --> 15:51.033
Oh, wait, one more thing,
Weezy.

15:51.100 --> 15:54.433
Remind Alan that he's related
to us. Make sure he gives
us a good deal.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.433
Hey...

15:57.633 --> 15:59.567
Well, see you all later...

16:03.633 --> 16:05.067
Okay... Hey, Weezy, ain't
you gonna ask...

16:05.133 --> 16:06.700
I'll have to do that when
I come back, George.

16:06.767 --> 16:08.833
Hey, hey, Alan, hey, I
just got a great idea.

16:08.900 --> 16:11.067
Why don't you go over
to the Help Center
with Louise?

16:11.133 --> 16:13.467
Well, well, would I be in
the way, Mrs. Jefferson?

16:13.533 --> 16:17.200
Of course not. You two
friends go ahead and have
a nice time, nice talk.

16:22.700 --> 16:23.700
(PHONE RINGING)

16:28.533 --> 16:30.200
Thank you.

16:34.233 --> 16:37.367
Now you've already seen
our reception area,

16:37.433 --> 16:40.767
and over there is where we
offer job counseling.

16:40.833 --> 16:44.900
And over here, is where we
provide free clothing.

16:46.033 --> 16:47.500
Oh, could I help you?

16:47.567 --> 16:49.700
No, thanks. Just looking.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.733
Uh, well, Alan,
that's the grand tour.

16:56.800 --> 17:00.167
Well, I'm impressed.
You got a lot of good stuff
going on down here.

17:00.233 --> 17:02.667
The spirit's a lot like
the commune.

17:02.733 --> 17:04.133
Well,

17:04.200 --> 17:06.533
Mr. Andrews is ready for us.

17:06.600 --> 17:08.400
Mrs. Willis
is already in there.

17:08.467 --> 17:11.433
Well, I guess we better
go in and give it
our best shot.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.100
Uh, who's Mr. Andrews?

17:13.167 --> 17:14.967
He's the son of a...

17:15.033 --> 17:18.300
He's the man who owns
this building.

17:19.533 --> 17:21.067
Wish us luck...

17:27.267 --> 17:29.767
You got anything like
this in brown?

17:33.500 --> 17:35.467
What's wrong with the blue?

17:35.533 --> 17:37.433
It doesn't match my socks...

17:52.300 --> 17:54.133
-Hey, how you doing, man?
-Fine.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.567
Say listen, you in a hurry?

17:55.633 --> 17:58.000
Uh, yeah, like my Eldorado's
parked in a "No Parking" zone.

17:58.067 --> 18:00.467
Well, with the little bit of
money you got here
in this can,

18:00.533 --> 18:01.733
you won't be able
to pay the ticket.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.767
Oh, come on, man,
I need this bread.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.367
Yeah, but there's not
nearly enough in here.

18:05.433 --> 18:08.400
Just nickels and dimes.
Only what these people
can afford.

18:08.467 --> 18:09.800
Say, man, what's with...

18:09.867 --> 18:11.533
Now why don't you take
that radio there?

18:11.600 --> 18:12.867
Probably get 10 bucks
for that.

18:12.933 --> 18:14.533
Yeah...

18:14.600 --> 18:17.600
And how about this nice
clock here?
Should get something for it.

18:17.667 --> 18:19.600
Say man, what's your game?

18:19.667 --> 18:23.600
Hey, no game. You said you
needed bread. I'm just trying
to help you out.

18:23.667 --> 18:26.233
I don't know, how much you
figure you'd sell this for,
30 bucks?

18:26.300 --> 18:27.767
Dude, you're crazy!

18:27.833 --> 18:29.733
Hey, now why don't you
take this coat, too, huh?

18:29.800 --> 18:32.200
Yeah, it doesn't fit
me anyhow.

18:35.100 --> 18:36.400
Hey, what are you, a cop?

18:36.467 --> 18:37.900
Do I look like a cop?

18:37.967 --> 18:40.967
No, but neither does Colombo.

18:41.033 --> 18:44.167
Oh, that reminds me. You
got anything in rain coats?

18:46.233 --> 18:48.333
Hey, now listen,
why don't you just take
your loot and split?

18:48.400 --> 18:50.000
Hey, man,
I can't take all of this.

18:50.067 --> 18:52.167
Why? You like ripping
people off, don't you?

18:52.233 --> 18:54.400
Hey, I didn't say I liked it.
I just do it.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.100
Oh, gotta make a living,
right?

18:56.167 --> 18:58.267
Hey, that's right, homes.

18:58.333 --> 19:00.200
You got to grab all you can,
'cause there ain't nobody
gonna help you.

19:00.267 --> 19:02.200
Well, you better not let
anybody in this place
hear you say that,

19:02.267 --> 19:03.533
'cause they might make
a liar out of you.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.533
Say what?

19:05.600 --> 19:07.367
The people who work
in this place are in the
business of helping people.

19:07.433 --> 19:09.567
Forget it, man. I've been
to all kind of places
like this,

19:09.633 --> 19:11.133
and all you get is talk.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.600
Yeah. And the problem
with talk is some people
are too dumb to listen.

19:13.667 --> 19:15.867
-You saying I'm dumb?
-No.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.267
You're smart.

19:18.333 --> 19:20.733
You're too smart to be ripping
off people who can help you.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.567
Help me do what?

19:22.633 --> 19:24.833
-Well, what do you wanna do?
-I don't know.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.767
Man, I know that feeling.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.833
But maybe this place could
give you some ideas.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.067
-Maybe.
-But you gotta talk about
them first.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.900
Yeah, hey,
you gonna be here tomorrow?

19:33.967 --> 19:35.467
-Will you?
-Maybe.

19:35.533 --> 19:37.733
Well then maybe I will.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.000
You know, you ain't bad
for a white dude.

19:42.167 --> 19:44.133
Oh, Alan honey, Louise
told me you were here.

19:44.833 --> 19:45.833
Oh, hi, Mom...

19:51.167 --> 19:52.733
Is this your mother?

19:52.800 --> 19:53.800
Yeah.

19:53.867 --> 19:55.667
Not bad for a white dude, huh?

19:57.267 --> 19:58.533
Uh, yeah.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.200
Oh, hey, bro...

20:03.733 --> 20:05.367
You don't miss nothing,
do you?

20:18.500 --> 20:20.100
That was a quick meeting.

20:20.167 --> 20:22.733
It doesn't take long
to say "get out".

20:22.800 --> 20:25.300
Mr. Andrews is throwing us
out of the building.

20:25.367 --> 20:26.600
-What?
-Yep.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.900
It looks like
the Help Center is through.

20:28.967 --> 20:30.833
Closing, huh? Figures.

20:32.233 --> 20:34.067
-Hey, bro, wait...
-Hey, ice it, man.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.433
I done heard enough
of your talk.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.367
I mean, you people
can't even help yourselves.

20:40.367 --> 20:43.067
Well, I guess we might
as well go in
and tell the others.

20:43.133 --> 20:44.833
Yeah.

20:44.900 --> 20:47.600
But don't blame yourself,
Louise. You put up
a good fight.

20:47.667 --> 20:49.167
We still lost.

20:51.267 --> 20:55.167
Hey, whosey, this place
is going out of business?

20:55.233 --> 20:56.833
Yeah, looks like it.

20:56.900 --> 21:01.267
Oh... Where am I gonna do
my shopping?

21:10.600 --> 21:14.200
Weezy, where's Alan?

21:14.267 --> 21:16.500
Aren't you gonna ask me
how things went
at the meeting?

21:16.567 --> 21:18.300
Okay, how did things go
at the meeting?

21:18.367 --> 21:20.333
Terrible, George.
It was awful.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.633
Oh, that's too bad.
Where's Alan?

21:24.500 --> 21:26.633
George, I don't know where
Alan is.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.033
He left the Center about
two hours ago.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.400
Well, didn't you ask him
about the warehouse?

21:30.467 --> 21:31.700
No, I forgot.

21:31.767 --> 21:33.500
Forgot, Weezy? How could
you do this to me?

21:33.567 --> 21:36.100
George, I've got other
things on my mind!

21:36.167 --> 21:38.867
It looks like we are gonna
have to close down
the Help Center!

21:38.933 --> 21:39.933
(PHONE RINGS)

21:41.333 --> 21:42.900
Hello?

21:42.967 --> 21:46.467
Of course, I'm home, Florence.
I answered the phone,
didn't I?

21:50.367 --> 21:51.633
What was that all about?

21:51.700 --> 21:53.433
She's over at Bentley's.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.767
She's been calling here
every 10 minutes asking
if you got home yet.

21:58.367 --> 22:00.233
Alan! Alan, my man!

22:00.300 --> 22:02.300
We were just talking
about you.

22:02.367 --> 22:04.267
Louise has got something
to ask you.

22:04.333 --> 22:06.700
Forget it, George!
If you wanna ask Alan,
ask him yourself.

22:07.367 --> 22:08.900
Okay, I will.

22:08.967 --> 22:10.667
Alan, my man,

22:10.733 --> 22:12.767
about that warehouse
you inherited.

22:12.833 --> 22:15.100
Sooner or later, you're gonna
have to do something with it,
right?

22:15.167 --> 22:17.633
Yep, you're right about
that, Mr. Jefferson.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.300
So I've been doing a lot
of thinking about it.

22:19.367 --> 22:22.533
And I figure the best thing
for you to do would be to
lease it to a friend.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.900
At a good price.

22:23.967 --> 22:27.200
Yep. Hey, I know where
you're coming from,
Mr. Jefferson,

22:27.267 --> 22:29.133
and I'm behind you
all the way.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.567
You are?
You hear that, Weezy?
He's with me all the way.

22:32.633 --> 22:35.933
I just came from
a lawyer's office where I
worked out the whole thing.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.267
Great!

22:37.333 --> 22:38.867
Mrs. Jefferson,

22:38.933 --> 22:40.700
do you have a dollar?

22:40.767 --> 22:43.367
Uh, yes.

22:43.433 --> 22:45.033
-But...
-Thanks.

22:45.100 --> 22:46.433
What's that for?

22:46.500 --> 22:47.867
Mrs. Jefferson,

22:47.933 --> 22:51.200
you've just bought yourself
a brand new
Help Center building.

22:51.267 --> 22:53.833
A brand new
Help Center building?

22:53.900 --> 22:56.167
I don't believe it.

22:56.233 --> 23:00.867
Me neither!
You gave her the warehouse?

23:00.933 --> 23:03.267
Well, I can't think of
a better use for that
warehouse. Can you?

23:03.333 --> 23:04.933
Are you kidding?

23:06.400 --> 23:08.867
And all the Center has to
do is pay the taxes.

23:08.933 --> 23:11.533
Oh, how can I ever thank you?

23:13.667 --> 23:17.333
Well, maybe you can let
me stay here until I work
things out with my Dad.

23:19.633 --> 23:21.900
Alan, you can stay
as long as you like.

23:21.967 --> 23:23.567
Weezy, what are you saying?

23:25.333 --> 23:27.400
TOGETHER: Ta-da!

23:27.467 --> 23:29.633
Ms. Jefferson, you don't
have to worry about
the Help Center no more,

23:29.700 --> 23:31.967
because we got
the perfect solution
for raising money.

23:32.033 --> 23:34.133
You're too late!
Forget it! Now look, Weezy...

23:34.200 --> 23:36.900
Oh, no, no, no, wait'll
you see our act. We'll
raise a million dollars.

23:36.967 --> 23:38.267
We're busy, Bentley!

23:38.333 --> 23:40.233
-You ready, Flo?
-Hit it, Harold.

23:42.100 --> 23:45.133
* Oh! We ain't got a barrel
of money,

23:45.200 --> 23:47.267
* Maybe we're ragged and
funny *

23:47.333 --> 23:48.600
I don't want this kid
staying here.

23:48.667 --> 23:50.533
He's staying as long
as he likes.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.200
I don't want him
to stay here no more.

23:52.267 --> 23:54.133
What about the warehouse?

23:54.200 --> 23:55.833
* But we're traveling along,
singing our song.
Side by side.

23:55.900 --> 23:57.867
* Don't know what's coming
tomorrow.

23:57.933 --> 23:59.667
* Maybe it's trouble
and sorrow.

23:59.733 --> 24:03.367
* But we travel along,
carrying our load,
side by side

24:03.433 --> 24:07.167
* Through all kinds of
weather, what if the sky
should fall

24:08.167 --> 24:10.567
* As long as
we're together

24:10.633 --> 24:12.700
* It doesn't matter at all

24:38.800 --> 24:43.100
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

24:43.167 --> 24:45.867
* Movin', movin' on up
