[music playing]

00:57.791 --> 01:01.462
So Dan's beard hairs are
all over the sink, you know.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.198
And his underwear's hanging
there on the doorknob.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.734
And he's griping because he
says a couple of lipsticks

01:06.834 --> 01:08.969
are taking up all his
bathroom space, you know,

01:09.069 --> 01:11.038
like he owns the place.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.940
This is my sink.

01:13.040 --> 01:16.144
This is my doorknob.

01:16.244 --> 01:19.647
That's why men, all the time,
miss the john, you know,

01:19.747 --> 01:22.150
because they're marking
their territory.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.418
OK, well, men are pigs.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.086
That's not news.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.555
Double zero.

01:27.655 --> 01:30.358
Oh, double zero.

01:30.458 --> 01:34.328
Well, that just about
sums up my whole vacation.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.465
Roseanne, you're
ruining your whole trip.

01:37.565 --> 01:41.669
Why don't you just go to
Dan and say I'm sorry?

01:41.769 --> 01:44.071
Let me tell you
something, Nancy.

01:44.172 --> 01:46.974
You do not stay
married for 18 years

01:47.074 --> 01:52.580
by blurting out stupid
little things like I'm sorry.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.915
So I'm on a roll like
you wouldn't believe,

01:55.015 --> 01:57.351
and she wants a little
romance, a little spontaneity

01:57.451 --> 01:58.619
that can't wait.

01:58.719 --> 02:01.289
So fine, I leave what
could be a small fortune.

02:01.389 --> 02:03.224
And the minute we get
upstairs, she starts yelling

02:03.324 --> 02:04.892
about underwear on doorknobs.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.126
She didn't want
them on the floor.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.395
She didn't want them on me.

02:07.495 --> 02:08.729
Where am I supposed to put them?

02:08.829 --> 02:09.897
Would you like
another card, sir.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.499
Sure, hit me.

02:11.599 --> 02:14.735
Why should you be any different?

02:14.835 --> 02:15.936
Sorry.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.639
I knew it, she yammered
the luck right out of me.

02:18.739 --> 02:19.640
Better luck next time.

02:19.740 --> 02:20.608
Next time?

02:20.708 --> 02:21.609
Uh-uh.

02:21.709 --> 02:22.776
No way I'm ever
getting married again.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.978
Great news, Dan.

02:25.078 --> 02:27.715
You got the Wayne
Newton tickets!

02:27.815 --> 02:28.749
Good news, Dan.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.150
You didn't.

02:30.251 --> 02:33.487
Aw, me and Rosie's been waiting
to see Wayne for 12 years!

02:33.587 --> 02:35.389
It's like the main
reason we came.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.324
It's not my fault, man.

02:36.424 --> 02:37.991
Wayne doesn't work on Mondays.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.593
We should've gone
last night, but we

02:39.693 --> 02:40.828
didn't go because
you said you could

02:40.928 --> 02:42.129
get better tickets tonight.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.964
I can get us front row
tickets tonight, Dan,

02:44.064 --> 02:47.468
but it won't be much fun
without Wayne there, will it?

02:47.568 --> 02:49.203
OK, OK, so we don't see Wayne.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.071
Now somehow she is going
to make this my fault,

02:51.171 --> 02:52.440
but I don't care.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.774
I already left nose
hairs in her sink.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.176
You can't hang a man twice.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.711
I did say I had
good news, right?

02:57.811 --> 03:00.381
Check this out-- four tickets
to the Las Vegas Legends

03:00.481 --> 03:03.684
in concert, the finest show
biz impersonators in the world.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.353
Well, that's not so bad then.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.688
I mean, if we saw Wayne, it'd
be over in a couple of hours.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.724
This way, I get to hear about
it for the rest of my life.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.025
There is one thing, though.

03:12.125 --> 03:12.960
What?

03:13.060 --> 03:14.295
These tickets are
free only if you

03:14.395 --> 03:17.465
and I go look at these timeshare
vacation condos right now.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.366

See, marriage is like
gambling, you know,

03:31.312 --> 03:33.781
while the odds are all
in favor of the house.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.483
Well, when your
marriage breaks up,

03:35.583 --> 03:38.886
make sure you keep the house.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.954
Roseanne, I think you'd
better eat something.

03:41.054 --> 03:45.058
And you know, marriage is
like this here slot machine, OK?

03:45.158 --> 03:48.329
You don't always get back
what you put into it, see?

03:48.429 --> 03:56.270
Ah, all right, honey, I
made your favorite dinner!

03:56.370 --> 03:59.072
Nah.

03:59.172 --> 04:05.313
Honey, I let your favorite
pants out another inch.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.880
Nah.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.283
Honey, I bore you
three children,

04:09.383 --> 04:13.854
and I got that soap you like!

04:13.954 --> 04:15.222
Zip.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.990
This proves my point.

04:17.090 --> 04:21.862
Marriage stinks
with a capital suck.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.263
Oh, come on, Roseanne.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.433
Stop it.

04:25.533 --> 04:30.137
Nancy, the longer I know
you, the more I got to ask you,

04:30.237 --> 04:33.307
why are you marrying that guy?

04:33.407 --> 04:36.777
I know, I mean, he's
not everything I deserve.

04:36.877 --> 04:41.148
And still I think, oh, you know,
do you want to marry the guy?

04:41.248 --> 04:44.217
Then he did something the other
day that really clinched it.

04:44.318 --> 04:47.120
He told me about that
little affair he had.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.489
He did?

04:48.589 --> 04:50.257
Uh-huh.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.626
And it's not like I
caught him or anything.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.396
He just thought if we're
going to be married,

04:55.496 --> 04:58.031
there shouldn't be any secrets.

04:58.131 --> 05:02.670
And that's when I knew I
could really trust him.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.938
I can't believe he told you!

05:05.038 --> 05:06.974
I was amazed.

05:07.074 --> 05:10.678
Nancy, you are really an
incredible person, you know?

05:10.778 --> 05:13.647
You've forgiven him,
and man, I haven't even

05:13.747 --> 05:16.149
forgiven Jackie yet.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.185
What does Jackie
got to do with it?

05:23.256 --> 05:25.258
You know, marriage is--

05:25.359 --> 05:27.294
It was Jackie?

05:27.395 --> 05:28.195
What was Jackie?

05:31.231 --> 05:34.267
He told me it was
some bimbo divorcee

05:34.368 --> 05:37.738
who threw herself at him,
and he'd never see her again.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.874
I'm going to kill him.

05:40.974 --> 05:45.278
Man, if Dan hadn't made me
come to Vegas, none of this

05:45.379 --> 05:46.179
would have happened!

complimentary drink

06:02.630 --> 06:03.897

girls don't get lost.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.340
Come on, man, it's
going to be great!

06:13.441 --> 06:14.608
You know, I was in
the john, and I saw

06:14.708 --> 06:15.843

06:15.943 --> 06:17.845

you'd swear it was him.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.008
But marry me, honey.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.877
Why didn't you tell me before?

06:49.977 --> 06:51.879
Well, I did tell you about me,
but why drag Jackie into this?

I didn't want you to hate her

06:54.114 --> 06:56.183

10:52.019 --> 10:54.855
Sit down!

10:54.955 --> 10:56.323
Look at that!

10:56.423 --> 10:57.290
Ha, ha!

10:57.390 --> 10:58.491
No, this guy--

10:58.591 --> 11:00.427
Wayne Newton-- he doesn't
even have a moustache!

11:00.527 --> 11:01.729
Wayne Newton has a moustache.

11:01.829 --> 11:05.198
How did he get out of Wayne
Newton impersonator school

11:05.298 --> 11:08.969
without a moustache?

11:09.069 --> 11:10.838
Hold it, fellas.
Fellas, hold it.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.139
Hold it, hold it,
fellas, hold it.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.041
Hold it.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.376
Excuse me, ma'am, I'm
sorry if my singing is

11:16.476 --> 11:18.578
interrupting your conversation.

11:18.678 --> 11:22.750
Well, not as sorry as I am!

11:22.850 --> 11:24.617
Ma'am, I'm going
to ask you politely

11:24.718 --> 11:26.153
to please take your seat.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.420
I'm entertaining.

11:27.520 --> 11:33.093
Oh, somebody has filled
your head with lies!

11:33.193 --> 11:36.730
Honey, honey, it
really is Wayne Newton.

11:36.830 --> 11:37.731
Oh, yeah, right.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.633
And I'm Lola Falana, Dan.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.669
Well, it's nice to
meet you, Miss Falana.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.341
My name is Wayne Newton.

11:48.441 --> 11:51.478
No, my name is Wayne Newton!

11:51.578 --> 11:55.783
No, my name is Wayne Newton.

11:55.883 --> 11:56.784
Wayne's looking at us.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.318
Ask him for his autograph.
- Oh, god.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.219
Oh, god.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.554
Oh, god.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.556
Ladies, I'm glad you're
having such a good time,

12:03.656 --> 12:04.892
because that's what
we're all here for.

12:04.992 --> 12:08.996
So why don't you just sit back,
relax, and enjoy the song?

12:09.096 --> 12:10.163
Why?

12:10.263 --> 12:12.732
Are you going to get
somebody else to sing it?

12:12.833 --> 12:13.700
Rosie!

12:13.801 --> 12:15.702
Rosie, that really
is Wayne Newton!

12:15.803 --> 12:17.437
Oh, yeah, right.

12:17.537 --> 12:18.338
Honey, It is!

12:18.438 --> 12:19.940
Now shut up!

12:20.040 --> 12:21.308
Ma'am, I think
you really ought

12:21.408 --> 12:24.411
to listen to your husband.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.146
Ooh, I don't believe it.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.380
Now he's telling me what to do.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.983
He sounds like every
other man on earth.

12:30.083 --> 12:34.287
Excuse me, every other man on
earth, except Wayne Newton!

12:39.592 --> 12:40.928
Pardon me, ma'am.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.963
I am going to have to ask
you to leave the building.

12:43.063 --> 12:43.864
Hold it, hold it.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.733
Don't you touch her.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.401
This woman doesn't ask
for much out of life.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.137
Believe me, she doesn't get it.

12:50.237 --> 12:51.438
The one thing she's
always wanted to do

12:51.538 --> 12:52.772
is see Wayne Newton.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.307
Now tomorrow morning, she's
going to wake up and realize

12:54.407 --> 12:55.308
what happened here
tonight, and she's

12:55.408 --> 12:56.443
going to want to kill herself.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.278
And dammit, I'm not
taking that away from her!

13:01.581 --> 13:02.582
I'm telling you
right now, buddy,

13:02.682 --> 13:05.252
there's no way we're
getting out of here.

13:05.352 --> 13:08.688
Dan, I'm going to be sick.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.589
I'll see you, Wayne.

13:12.893 --> 13:13.927
One more thing.

13:14.027 --> 13:14.928
Yes, Mr. Falana?

13:17.730 --> 13:19.432
I'm really sorry
about all this.

13:19.532 --> 13:20.400
I'm a huge fan!

13:23.436 --> 13:26.473
ROSEANNE: I just
threw up on Paul Anka!

13:29.509 --> 13:31.644
Well, there goes
one lucky guy.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.855
[telephone ringing]

13:41.955 --> 13:43.924
Telephone.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.425
I just wouldn't
want to turn you away

13:45.525 --> 13:47.627
from your nutritious breakfast.

13:47.727 --> 13:48.528
Oh, bite me.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.765
Hello?

13:52.866 --> 13:53.666
Mom?

13:53.766 --> 13:56.103
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:56.203 --> 13:59.873
Yes, Mother, I'll pick you
up at the airport tonight.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.310
No, Mom, I'm not
going to forget.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.845
OK, here's my sundial.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.915
I found this part,
but I made the stick.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.718
Oh, man.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.925
Uh, Becky?

14:18.025 --> 14:21.361
DJ made a sundial out
of birth control pills.

14:21.461 --> 14:22.362
What?

14:22.462 --> 14:26.366
It even tells the
days of the week!

14:26.466 --> 14:27.367
I'm going to go, Mom.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.369
Love you.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.438
Geez, Mom went to
Vegas without these?

14:31.538 --> 14:34.307
She really is a gambler.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.909
They're not Mom's.

14:36.009 --> 14:39.179
DJ, Jackie's probably
looking all over for these!

14:39.279 --> 14:43.050
Listen, you are not to take
these to school, understand?

14:43.150 --> 14:44.617
Now you go and
find something else

14:44.717 --> 14:46.019
to make your sundial out of.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.054
OK.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.188
I'll go put these
back in your drawer.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.493
They're yours?

14:53.593 --> 14:54.694
You slut!

14:54.794 --> 14:57.130
Shut up.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.198
Oh, my god!

14:58.298 --> 14:59.566
You're doing it with Mark!

14:59.666 --> 15:00.733
Shut up, Darlene.

15:00.833 --> 15:01.868
Wait a minute.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.104
When your naked bodies
were pressed together,

15:04.204 --> 15:09.276
were you making actual words
or just grunting like animals?

15:09.376 --> 15:11.144
Shut up, Darlene!

15:11.244 --> 15:13.780
Mom's going to love this.

15:13.880 --> 15:14.948
Mom already knows.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.183
Who do you think
bought me the pills?

15:20.020 --> 15:20.820
Slammer!

15:34.867 --> 15:36.236
Can you believe this?

15:36.336 --> 15:40.007
I specifically told
Arnie to be here at 9:30.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.808
See, Dan?
There was no hurry.

15:41.908 --> 15:45.578
I could have thrown
up a few more times.

15:45.678 --> 15:46.479
That's it.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.348
If he's not here
in five minutes,

15:48.448 --> 15:50.650
I'm marrying the 10:15.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.085
All right, honey, let's roll.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.320
Where have you been?

15:53.420 --> 15:54.854
Sorry, I had to go get my tux.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.556
Hey, Dan!
Look, it came with one of these.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.458
I guess some guys have got to
be blindfold to get married.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.497
You're not wearing that
costume to my wedding.

16:04.597 --> 16:05.798
It's my wedding too.
I like it.

16:05.898 --> 16:06.866
I'm wearing it.
- Oh, really?

16:06.966 --> 16:07.867
Well, good.

16:07.967 --> 16:08.968
I hope you bought
it, because you're

16:09.069 --> 16:10.370
going to be buried in it.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.371
What about the way you look?

16:11.471 --> 16:12.639
It would be great
if we were getting

16:12.739 --> 16:15.875
married in a go-go cage.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.777
You love the way I look.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.379
You look like a cheap hooker!

16:19.479 --> 16:21.081
Leave your old
girlfriends out of this.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.287
Can you tell them we're ready?

16:27.387 --> 16:28.188
Let's go, Arn.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.123
Break.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.526
Run for it, man.

Friends, we are gathered
here to join together these two

16:44.504 --> 16:48.741
wonderful people, Nancy Lynn
Bartlett and Arnold Shimp

16:48.841 --> 16:53.946
Thomas, in holy matrimony.

16:54.047 --> 16:55.415
Marriage is a sacred
commitment that

16:55.515 --> 16:57.250
should not be taken lightly.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.287
Do you, Arnie, take this
woman to be your wife?

17:00.387 --> 17:01.621
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER):
Look at those two.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.491
They look so happy.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.126
I give it a month.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.961
For better or worse,
for richer, for poorer--

17:09.062 --> 17:10.130
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER):
Pretty tricky

17:10.230 --> 17:12.599
how they slip that stuff in.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.767
Who's thinking
about that anyway?

17:14.867 --> 17:18.305
When you first start out, you
love a guy, you marry him.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.307
You have no idea
what you're in for.

17:20.407 --> 17:23.910
Do you, Nancy, take this
man Arnie to be your husband?

17:24.010 --> 17:26.179
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER):
But I guess I did OK.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.547
I mean, after 18
years of marriage,

17:27.647 --> 17:29.249
it is nice to have
a man who will

17:29.349 --> 17:30.550
hold your head while you barf.

17:33.353 --> 17:36.956
I really do love
him, that big goon.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.691
I know he loves me.

17:38.791 --> 17:42.795
Of course, he can't say it with
his shorts on, but he loves me.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.032
Look at the way he looks at me.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.267
DAN (VOICEOVER):
Boy, I shouldn't have

17:47.367 --> 17:51.671
had that sausage for breakfast.

17:51.771 --> 17:56.343
I wonder if she's got
any antacid in her purse.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.010
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.280
You may kiss the bride.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.314
Slut.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.418
Congratulations, Arnie.

will never be the same.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.656

18:15.228 --> 18:17.364
OK, now it's your turn.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.731
What you talking about?

18:18.831 --> 18:20.066
Little surprise.

18:20.167 --> 18:22.435
We thought the two of you
might want to renew your vows.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.670
You guys are the 10:15.

18:23.770 --> 18:24.604
I already paid the man.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.342
Hey, I didn't get to go
to your first wedding,

18:29.442 --> 18:30.777
because you didn't invite me.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.616
Well, what do you think, Dan?

18:36.716 --> 18:37.817
Couldn't hurt.

18:37.917 --> 18:41.654
Oh, that's just what you
said when you proposed.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.356
I still mean it, honey!

18:43.456 --> 18:44.691
So you wanna?

Why not?

Friends, we are gathered
here today to join together

18:53.300 --> 18:55.067
these two wonderful people--

in holy matrimony.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.542
Do you, uh--

19:02.642 --> 19:06.679
Mrs. Conner-- take this
man to love and to honor--

19:06.779 --> 19:08.948
We already did these vows.

19:09.048 --> 19:11.218
So now, I think, this
time let's do something

19:11.318 --> 19:13.386
that means something, OK?

19:13.486 --> 19:18.258
Like OK-- do you, Dan,
promise to keep your beard out

19:18.358 --> 19:21.261
of the sink and to,
like, hose yourself

19:21.361 --> 19:23.129
off after coming home
from work every now

19:23.230 --> 19:26.566
and then if I, like,
promise to give you

19:26.666 --> 19:31.070
a clean towel in the morning?
- K, I do.

19:33.906 --> 19:37.076
Do you, Roseanne, promise to
quit buying me goofy looking

19:37.176 --> 19:40.247
shirts that I don't like if
I promise to throw the shirts

19:40.347 --> 19:43.416
that I do like into the hamper?

19:43.516 --> 19:44.317
Cool.

19:47.220 --> 19:51.391
And if you'll discipline your
kids so that I'm not always

19:51.491 --> 19:53.693
the bad guy, well,
then I'll stop making

19:53.793 --> 19:55.027
fun of your stupid friends.

19:55.127 --> 19:57.830
Sorry, Arnie.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.366
Done.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.133
OK, how about if
you quit saying you

20:01.234 --> 20:04.271
can watch football any
time during the Super Bowl,

20:04.371 --> 20:06.273
and I'll toss you
a compliment on how

20:06.373 --> 20:08.275
you look once in a while, no
matter what you look like.

Yeah.
