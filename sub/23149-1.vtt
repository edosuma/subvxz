00:35.936 --> 00:38.637
I loved my wife.

00:38.672 --> 00:41.773
I loved her with all my heart.

00:41.808 --> 00:44.709
She was everything to me.

00:44.744 --> 00:47.779
She was the reason I existed.

00:47.814 --> 00:49.748
And my daughter too.

00:49.783 --> 00:54.286
Frankie..
Marianna..

00:54.321 --> 00:55.620
We're late!

00:55.655 --> 00:57.956
Come on! Ladies..

00:57.991 --> 01:00.792
Honey, can't we just have one time?

01:00.827 --> 01:02.627
Look.. A girl has
to look her best

01:02.662 --> 01:04.296
on a big night like this.

01:04.331 --> 01:05.564
You look spectacular.

01:05.599 --> 01:06.965
It's her big night.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.967
Aw, this makes me so happy..

01:09.002 --> 01:11.836
The three of us being together as a family.

01:11.871 --> 01:14.973
This is like my winning the lottery.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.775
I love you ladies, it's gonna be special.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.476
Love you too, dad.

01:18.511 --> 01:20.212
Let's go.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.547
I can't believe it, our baby's all grown up.

01:22.582 --> 01:25.650
Eighteen, graduated.
I'm so proud of you.

01:25.685 --> 01:28.420
She's still a baby.

01:28.455 --> 01:32.224
She's a baby but she's also a grown woman.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.759
Look at her, look how beautiful she is.

01:34.794 --> 01:38.396
Hey, if you ask real nice I bet you can

01:38.431 --> 01:40.932
get your dad to dance with you.

01:40.967 --> 01:43.702
Tough guys don't dance, sweetie.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.537
You're not so tough..

01:45.572 --> 01:48.640
Your mother got you something
special for your graduation.

01:48.675 --> 01:50.542
This is not just a big day for you.

01:50.577 --> 01:51.810
We're very proud of you.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.979
Listen, honey.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.748
We got this for you because we want you to

01:56.783 --> 01:59.384
know how much we love
you, how proud we are of

01:59.419 --> 02:02.354
you but we also want you
to remember this night -

02:02.389 --> 02:04.489
hopefully for the rest of
your life - to remember

02:04.524 --> 02:06.424
this moment how much we love you.

02:06.459 --> 02:10.929
And, for us, our love for
you is timeless, honey.

02:21.741 --> 02:23.475
Oh, my god!

02:23.510 --> 02:25.410
It's gorgeous.

02:25.445 --> 02:26.745
Thank her.
She picked it,

02:26.780 --> 02:28.346
I just gave her the credit card.

02:33.853 --> 02:36.021
Oh.. What a
beautiful night, honey.

02:36.056 --> 02:38.023
It was awesome and the food was great.

02:38.058 --> 02:39.958
You know how to pick stuff for us.

02:39.993 --> 02:44.562
No, but what made it special was the night,

02:44.597 --> 02:46.865
was the daughter,
was the husband -

02:46.900 --> 02:48.700
the family, come on.

02:48.735 --> 02:51.036
I mean, there's nothing
better than this, huh?

02:51.071 --> 02:52.971
It was amazing. Thank
you, guys, so much.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.773
We need to do this more often.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.841
I mean, I don't think we get out enough.

02:56.876 --> 02:58.743
I'm serious. That
was a lot of fun.

02:58.778 --> 03:01.413
Okay. That's music
to our ears, right?

03:01.448 --> 03:03.348
We would love to do more of this with you.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.383
Your job really takes you away from us,

03:05.418 --> 03:06.985
but that's great, that's fantastic.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.453
And I'm really proud..

03:08.488 --> 03:09.954
Really, really proud of the university

03:09.989 --> 03:12.023
you got into and we're still gonna be close.

03:12.058 --> 03:13.958
Yeah! I know,
I'm so happy.

03:13.993 --> 03:16.428
We'll only visit you once every other day.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.964
I'll come in, I'll do your laundry.

03:19.999 --> 03:21.933
- Okay, sounds good to me.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.101
The fuck is that?

03:23.136 --> 03:24.436
What's happening?

03:40.387 --> 03:43.055
Al? Al?

03:51.064 --> 03:53.098
Al.

03:53.133 --> 04:01.906
Al.. Al.. Al?

04:01.941 --> 04:03.975
Thank god.

04:04.010 --> 04:06.711
The fuck, is this a bad dream?

04:06.746 --> 04:08.847
Al..

04:27.901 --> 04:29.834
I'm sorry.

04:29.869 --> 04:34.139
I fell asleep for like three seconds.

04:34.174 --> 04:37.709
Sorry.

04:37.744 --> 04:39.744
You're sorry?

04:39.779 --> 04:41.546
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.681
I'm gonna fucking rip your face off!

04:43.716 --> 04:45.517
You're sorry?

04:45.552 --> 04:48.186
I'm gonna destroy you!

04:48.221 --> 04:51.122
Gonna break
your fuckin' n-

05:00.533 --> 05:03.001
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

05:07.173 --> 05:10.074
I miss my wife and I miss my daughter.

05:10.109 --> 05:13.211
I wish I would have died with them.

05:13.246 --> 05:19.951
The only thing that keeps
me breathing is my job.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.600
Al.

05:35.635 --> 05:36.768
Fuck.

05:36.803 --> 05:37.836
Al!

05:46.145 --> 05:47.212
Al!

05:54.554 --> 05:55.587
Al!

06:12.171 --> 06:14.138
Fuckin'..

06:14.173 --> 06:16.508
Al!

06:59.218 --> 07:01.953
Al!

07:01.988 --> 07:07.025
Al...

07:07.060 --> 07:14.265
Al.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.900
Al...

07:15.935 --> 07:17.669
Al.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.704
Whoa, wake up.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.005
What are you doing here?

07:21.040 --> 07:22.941
It's my day off.
Get out of here.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.776
I know it's your day off, I'm sorry.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.177
Why don't you sleep in the bed?

07:26.212 --> 07:27.812
Two and a half years,

07:27.847 --> 07:29.581
you're always on the couch.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.349
Would you stop touching my thigh, you pig?

07:31.384 --> 07:33.251
Al, we gotta go.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.819
I'm not going nowhere.

07:34.854 --> 07:36.654
The director called, it's urgent.

07:36.689 --> 07:39.624
I worked 15 fucking hours a day,

07:39.659 --> 07:40.959
seven days straight.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.961
I'm off today, send somebody else.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.596
Al, listen.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.930
I'm sorry but we gotta go.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.765
Don't step on my fucking shoes.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.934
Nobody's stepping on your shoes, we gotta go.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.070
I've been fucking calling you for the

07:52.105 --> 07:53.671
last two hours.
We gotta go!

07:53.706 --> 07:57.108
Ah..

07:57.143 --> 07:59.177
Where are we going?
What are we doing?

07:59.212 --> 08:01.279
The director
wants us there.. Now.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.914
Like, now.

08:02.949 --> 08:08.019
Do I got time for a shower?

08:08.054 --> 08:09.854
I'm sorry, you don't.

08:09.889 --> 08:12.790
How about an Italian shower?

08:12.825 --> 08:14.292
What's that?

08:14.327 --> 08:16.160
I throw my balls in the sink and

08:16.195 --> 08:17.862
give 'em a little freshening up.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.300
Jesus Christ.

08:28.307 --> 08:30.208
Come on, al.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.643
Al..

08:31.678 --> 08:33.311
You okay?

08:33.346 --> 08:34.179
Yeah.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.019
Fuck, you're lucky you didn't get towed.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.720
Who's gonna tow me?

08:42.755 --> 08:44.022
Okay, we'll go in my car.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.723
We'll go in my car,

08:45.758 --> 08:47.191
I'm not gonna drive in a minivan.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.862
Jesus Christ, you okay?

08:53.433 --> 08:58.670
You okay?

08:58.705 --> 09:03.808
Will you stop it?
You're like an old lady.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.677
Look how you parked, let's take my car.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.313
Can you please fill me in on what's going on?

09:42.348 --> 09:46.984
Who called you?

09:47.019 --> 09:49.187
- I already told you, the director.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.254
Himself?

09:50.289 --> 09:51.756
-Of course himself.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.391
Wow. You
didn't say to him

09:53.426 --> 09:55.426
"palermo's been
working 17-18 hour days.

09:55.461 --> 09:57.395
This is the first fucking day off

09:57.430 --> 10:00.765
in 18 fucking
straight days?"

10:00.800 --> 10:02.366
- He knows that, he knows that.

10:12.845 --> 10:14.812
Ah, come on in, fellas.

10:14.847 --> 10:17.782
These are my two top investigators here.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.450
Introduce yourselves.

10:19.485 --> 10:20.752
Robert Santos.

10:20.787 --> 10:21.986
-Nice to meet you.

10:22.021 --> 10:24.455
Margaret Adams.

10:24.490 --> 10:27.091
- Sorry to meet under these circumstances.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.993
Agent Derek Sampson.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.161
Robert Santos.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.796
Joseph.
How are you?

10:31.831 --> 10:32.997
Director.

10:33.032 --> 10:34.298
Nice to see you again.

10:34.333 --> 10:37.969
Sit down.. Pull up
a chair, will you?

10:38.004 --> 10:39.837
I'm good here if you don't mind.

10:39.872 --> 10:44.542
Okay. Relax,
everybody have a seat.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.077
Let's proceed.

10:46.112 --> 10:48.112
Proceed, please.

10:48.147 --> 10:53.451
At approximately
7:45 this morning

10:53.486 --> 10:56.788
I arrived at the Adams' home

10:56.823 --> 11:00.057
to take young miss Adams to school.

11:00.092 --> 11:03.027
Alright, sir, you have
a meeting from 9:00 to

11:03.062 --> 11:05.062
10:00 am with the
Canadian minister of

11:05.097 --> 11:08.032
finance for, I would say maybe two hours.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.567
Is that about enough time for that?

11:09.602 --> 11:11.135
Plenty.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.404
So then after that you'll have a meeting

11:13.439 --> 11:15.907
with the department of water and power.

11:15.942 --> 11:18.109
We told her we were taking her

11:18.144 --> 11:20.111
after school today.
Did you forget?

11:20.146 --> 11:23.581
No, I did not forget.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.850
I tell you
what. Marie?

11:25.885 --> 11:27.518
Clear my slate for the day.

11:27.553 --> 11:29.520
I'm gonna spend it with my family.

11:29.555 --> 11:30.855
-Alright.

11:30.890 --> 11:33.191
Mom, can I have some money?

11:33.226 --> 11:34.425
Sure.

11:34.460 --> 11:35.993
Um, do you have cash?

11:36.028 --> 11:42.567
Um.. Yes,
I do.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.202
Here, sweetie.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.403
Thanks.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.839
Is this okay to wear today?

11:47.874 --> 11:49.941
Should I wear it?

11:49.976 --> 11:51.409
Yes, of course you should wear it.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.544
You look absolutely gorgeous, as always.

11:53.579 --> 11:55.213
Thanks.

11:55.248 --> 11:59.884
At about 7:50 she came
outside and informed me

11:59.919 --> 12:01.552
she would prefer to walk.

12:01.587 --> 12:03.354
It's exactly a 12 minute walk,

12:03.389 --> 12:04.989
we've done it before.

12:12.999 --> 12:16.400
Around 8:00 am we
were waiting to cross

12:16.435 --> 12:18.036
rideau street..

12:43.663 --> 12:48.199
I looked at my phone and, um..

12:48.234 --> 12:52.503
That point she crossed
and we became separated.

12:52.538 --> 12:55.006
I yelled her name but she
had her headphones in,

12:55.041 --> 12:56.674
she did not hear me.

12:56.709 --> 12:59.076
When traffic allowed me
to pass she had rounded

12:59.111 --> 13:01.579
the corner in the alley,
at which point I-

13:01.614 --> 13:03.948
may I interrupt you for a second, please?

13:03.983 --> 13:05.316
You took your eyes off her?

13:05.351 --> 13:07.084
That's correct.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.186
I should've never taken my eyes off her.

13:09.221 --> 13:10.955
But I did for one second.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.523
I then tried to cross,

13:12.558 --> 13:14.625
there was a truck
in my way, and so-

13:14.660 --> 13:16.327
you took your eyes off her.

13:16.362 --> 13:18.262
Okay, my daughter is missing.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.397
Mrs. Adams?

13:19.432 --> 13:21.032
Do something.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.633
We're taking care of it.

13:22.668 --> 13:24.468
Mrs. Adams,
they're our top two

13:24.503 --> 13:26.437
lead investigators on this case.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.906
Continue, please.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.146
Jennifer!
Hang on!

13:39.385 --> 13:41.118
Jennifer!

13:41.153 --> 13:43.087
When she rounded the corner,

13:43.122 --> 13:45.156
at that point is when I...

13:48.027 --> 13:51.062
..Saw her headphones
on the ground.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.198
Jennifer?

14:02.208 --> 14:04.275
I cased the immediate area and

14:04.310 --> 14:06.310
when I did not find her I called it in.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.212
This is special agent Derek Sampson.

14:08.247 --> 14:10.014
We have a situation.

14:10.049 --> 14:12.083
Dispatch Ottawa police immediately.

14:14.286 --> 14:15.653
With all due respect, sir,

14:15.688 --> 14:17.722
this is an American citizen.

14:20.226 --> 14:23.761
I think that we should
lead the investigation.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.162
How can you lead the investigation?

14:25.197 --> 14:26.397
You're in Canada.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.699
Whether it's an abduction or a kidnapping..

14:28.734 --> 14:31.402
It's Canadian.

14:31.437 --> 14:34.305
We got jurisdiction.
Do we not?

14:34.340 --> 14:35.706
Excuse me.

14:35.741 --> 14:41.779
I'm here, sir, at the personal request

14:41.814 --> 14:47.084
of the president of the United States.

14:47.119 --> 14:51.122
Now, if you will allow us, as observers

14:51.157 --> 14:56.093
- just as observers - I
think we might be able

14:56.128 --> 14:59.397
to provide the leverage you might need.

14:59.432 --> 15:02.066
Director:
That's acceptable.

15:02.101 --> 15:04.068
What do you mean it's acceptable?

15:04.103 --> 15:06.170
I mean, with all due respect, director,

15:06.205 --> 15:07.671
you are the director.

15:07.706 --> 15:10.608
I don't want FBI and secret service

15:10.643 --> 15:13.044
to get in our
way. I mean-

15:13.079 --> 15:15.713
you are the lead investigators, both of you.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.481
I'll leave it to my partner.

15:17.516 --> 15:19.683
Robert? You
okay with that?

15:19.718 --> 15:21.452
I think it's a great idea.

15:21.487 --> 15:23.287
We have a common goal:

15:23.322 --> 15:24.722
To find the ambassador's daughter.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.323
Alfonse?

15:26.358 --> 15:29.326
Fine.. Fine.

15:29.361 --> 15:31.695
Alfonse, can you get to the crime scene?

15:31.730 --> 15:34.065
If you don't mind, I would like to speak to

15:34.100 --> 15:37.635
the ambassador first, and his wife

15:37.670 --> 15:40.104
to get a bit of intel.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.772
I don't think at this stage of the game we're

15:41.807 --> 15:44.642
gonna add anything to what's going on

15:44.677 --> 15:46.343
at the crime scene.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.112
Sir, I'm gonna have to disagree.

15:48.147 --> 15:50.181
I think we need to get to the crime scene.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.649
It's not protocol for
you to disagree or-

15:51.684 --> 15:53.150
it's protocol to go to a crime scene

15:53.185 --> 15:54.819
when a crime happens.

15:54.854 --> 15:57.488
Please, I'm speaking to
my director here, okay?

15:57.523 --> 15:59.457
I don't want to get in a pissing match here.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.692
Before I start my investigation, if I may..

16:01.727 --> 16:04.128
If I am the lead investigator with my

16:04.163 --> 16:06.297
partner, Robert, I would like to speak to

16:06.332 --> 16:10.401
the ambassador first, and his wife.

16:10.436 --> 16:12.236
I think that's a wonderful idea.

16:12.271 --> 16:14.105
Okay, let's do this.

16:18.377 --> 16:19.743
Excuse me,
Mr. Santos?

16:19.778 --> 16:21.579
If you need anything, please don't hesitate

16:21.614 --> 16:23.547
to call me but please don't call me at night

16:23.582 --> 16:25.349
because I'm packing.
See, I'm moving-

16:25.384 --> 16:26.817
and who are you?

16:26.852 --> 16:29.487
I'm the personal
assistant of Mr. Adams.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.655
Okay, we'll let you know if we need anything.

16:31.690 --> 16:32.723
Thank you.

16:53.279 --> 16:56.714
That was disrespectful.
It's their investigation.

16:56.749 --> 17:00.218
We should wait our turn.

17:03.556 --> 17:04.722
This won't take long.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.323
Thank you, I appreciate it,

17:06.358 --> 17:08.726
ambassador, madam ambassador.

17:08.761 --> 17:12.663
I'm just trying to understand..

17:12.698 --> 17:16.166
You had breakfast this morning

17:16.202 --> 17:17.201
with your daughter?

17:17.236 --> 17:18.502
Yes.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.204
Was she in a bad mood?

17:20.239 --> 17:21.739
No.

17:21.773 --> 17:22.839
Did you guys have an argument?

17:22.875 --> 17:24.608
No, I never argue with my daughter.

17:24.643 --> 17:25.843
Please don't get defensive.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.912
I need to understand her mindset.

17:27.946 --> 17:30.214
If it's a game, kids that age sometimes

17:30.249 --> 17:32.283
if they get pissed off at their parents..

17:32.318 --> 17:34.618
No, no, my daughter and I had a wonderful

17:34.653 --> 17:36.287
relationship. We
were really more

17:36.322 --> 17:37.888
friends than anything else.

17:37.923 --> 17:39.456
-One child?

17:39.491 --> 17:40.758
Yes.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.726
So, you had breakfast..

17:42.761 --> 17:45.763
Did you guys discuss anything at breakfast?

17:45.798 --> 17:47.965
It was a normal breakfast
just like any other day.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.634
Please indulge me.
What was the discussion?

17:50.669 --> 17:54.672
Did she ask for money?
Are you planning the day?

17:54.707 --> 17:56.907
I'm just trying to get some insight.

17:56.942 --> 17:59.443
Yes, she asked for $35.

17:59.478 --> 18:00.778
What was that for?

18:00.813 --> 18:04.448
I don't know, um, I didn't ask.

18:04.483 --> 18:05.916
You just gave her $35?

18:05.951 --> 18:07.685
You didn't ask what the money was for?

18:07.720 --> 18:09.853
She's a good
kid, so I-i just..

18:09.888 --> 18:11.755
I just figured, I don't
know, maybe she wanted to

18:11.790 --> 18:13.357
buy something, or lunch.

18:13.392 --> 18:15.359
It really wasn't anything
out of the ordinary.

18:15.394 --> 18:16.560
What about you?

18:16.595 --> 18:18.529
Did you have an argument with your daughter?

18:18.564 --> 18:20.297
Not at all. I cleared
my slate so I could

18:20.332 --> 18:21.999
spend the day with my family, actually.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.934
Is that a problem, you don't get a chance to

18:23.969 --> 18:25.669
spend time with your family?

18:25.704 --> 18:27.338
I'm the ambassador to Canada

18:27.373 --> 18:28.872
from the United States.

18:28.907 --> 18:30.708
I'm asking you a question.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.676
I work, I have a busy day.

18:32.711 --> 18:34.245
But I decided
to clear my-

18:34.280 --> 18:37.581
business comes first?
Over your family?

18:37.616 --> 18:40.651
On a normal day I go to work,

18:40.686 --> 18:42.686
my daughter goes to school.

18:42.721 --> 18:44.855
And do you have dinner every night at home?

18:44.890 --> 18:46.257
Most nights.

18:46.292 --> 18:46.958
Hmph.

18:51.063 --> 18:55.032
My initial feeling on this is that somebody's

18:55.067 --> 18:56.800
trying to get back at you.

18:56.835 --> 18:58.769
And I'm not trying to embarrass you

18:58.804 --> 19:01.805
in front of your wife,
but I've read up on you

19:01.840 --> 19:03.807
and you've had some indiscretions.

19:03.842 --> 19:05.809
It was all over the tabloids and the

19:05.844 --> 19:07.511
newspapers in Los Angeles.

19:07.546 --> 19:10.381
Yes, there have been some indiscretions,

19:10.416 --> 19:11.882
unfortunately, but..

19:13.452 --> 19:16.620
Yes, I have been
weak. But we have-

19:16.655 --> 19:18.722
my wife has made me stronger.

19:18.757 --> 19:20.724
So everything's good now?

19:20.759 --> 19:22.459
We're working on things.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.335
Agent Sampson.

19:33.539 --> 19:35.472
Took my eyes off her, sir.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.408
Yes, sir.
No, sir.

19:38.977 --> 19:41.846
Sir, I think that
I would be valu-

19:44.650 --> 19:45.916
yes, sir.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.556
Who was that, Washington?

19:55.661 --> 19:57.461
They're calling you back?

19:57.496 --> 19:58.896
-Yeah.

20:04.103 --> 20:05.636
Fraser here.

20:05.671 --> 20:07.471
Good morning, Brian.

20:07.506 --> 20:09.540
Mr. president.

20:09.575 --> 20:12.042
You know I'm gonna take a
lot of heat for allowing

20:12.077 --> 20:15.379
the Canadians to do their investigation.

20:15.414 --> 20:16.780
Yes, I understand.

20:16.815 --> 20:19.650
The ambassador is American, so the

20:19.685 --> 20:21.952
Americans believe that we should handle it.

20:21.987 --> 20:23.721
Yes, and we will accommodate your people

20:23.756 --> 20:25.823
as observers,
sir. Yes, sir.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.758
You know, Brian, the grandmother of this

20:27.793 --> 20:29.860
little girl is a pain in the ass.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.962
Understood, sir, yes.

20:31.997 --> 20:34.965
Any minute now she's gonna be calling you.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.633
Yes, yes, sir.

20:36.668 --> 20:38.969
You know, Brian, we've
been friends a long time.

20:39.004 --> 20:40.704
Yes, sir.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.940
I've got 100% faith in you.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.542
I got my best guys on it, yes, sir.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.011
Brian, best of luck.

20:48.046 --> 20:50.381
Thank you, sir.
Very good, sir.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.883
If you need anything, please call me.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.985
Okay, god bless.
Thank you.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.562
Have I done something to offend you, officer?

21:05.597 --> 21:07.464
I'm just asking.

21:07.499 --> 21:09.466
Did you not have any indiscretions?

21:09.501 --> 21:11.468
Has your name not been in the paper?

21:11.503 --> 21:12.770
I'm not picking on you,

21:12.805 --> 21:14.705
I'm trying to get some background.

21:14.740 --> 21:18.609
The next 24 hours are going to be extremely

21:18.644 --> 21:21.912
vital to her existence,
and we want to find her,

21:21.947 --> 21:23.781
so I need to understand

21:23.816 --> 21:26.417
if somebody's paying you back.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.852
To the best of my knowledge

21:28.887 --> 21:31.955
there is no payback involved.

21:31.990 --> 21:34.591
Well, it's too early to tell.

21:34.626 --> 21:35.893
Did you take care of that tap?

21:35.928 --> 21:37.094
-Yeah.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.997
So your phones are tapped.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.900
Your cell phones are both
tapped and we did this

21:42.935 --> 21:45.202
for the protection of the little girl

21:45.237 --> 21:46.904
in case somebody calls or

21:46.939 --> 21:49.873
somebody makes some sort of demand.

21:49.908 --> 21:51.108
Excuse me.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.844
Do you mind if we interview your assistant?

21:53.879 --> 21:56.213
I have no problem with that at all.

21:56.248 --> 21:58.048
Why do you want to do that?

21:58.083 --> 21:59.817
How is it relevant?

21:59.852 --> 22:00.951
I just want to interview her.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.653
Is that okay?

22:02.688 --> 22:04.054
Okay, interview her.

22:04.089 --> 22:05.789
Anyways, thank you.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.491
Thank you so much for your time.

22:07.526 --> 22:09.092
I appreciate it.

22:09.127 --> 22:10.861
If we hear anything you'll hear from us.

22:10.896 --> 22:12.229
Thank you.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.731
-Thank you.

22:18.504 --> 22:22.206
How long you known that girl?

22:22.241 --> 22:25.776
- Over three years now.

22:25.811 --> 22:27.211
You with her every day?

22:27.246 --> 22:29.112
-Every day.

22:29.147 --> 22:31.015
You were the babysitter.

22:35.754 --> 22:38.856
You're not going anywhere.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.858
I'm gonna take care of it.

22:40.893 --> 22:44.061
I need you here..

22:44.096 --> 22:50.567
And you need this.

22:50.602 --> 22:52.569
Alright, you bring her in.

22:52.604 --> 22:53.904
I gotta make a few phone calls.

22:53.939 --> 22:57.274
I want to - for
both our benefit -

22:57.309 --> 23:01.745
let's get a report on
what phone calls come in.

23:01.780 --> 23:04.014
And you know what I want to know?

23:04.049 --> 23:06.149
I want to know the phone calls that

23:06.184 --> 23:08.685
they got yesterday and the day before.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.053
Now that he knows they're tapped,

23:10.088 --> 23:11.922
which phone calls stopped?

23:11.957 --> 23:13.090
Got it.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.825
That's important to me, please, Robert?

23:14.860 --> 23:16.193
Thanks.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.628
Thank you for being here.

23:17.663 --> 23:19.029
My pleasure.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.031
How long have you worked for the ambassador?

23:21.066 --> 23:24.535
Oh, ever since the start
of his political career.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.303
About 15 years.

23:26.338 --> 23:28.772
Where are you from?

23:28.807 --> 23:29.973
New York.

23:30.008 --> 23:31.808
I went to Columbia university.

23:31.843 --> 23:33.610
Wonderful school.

23:33.645 --> 23:34.878
Mm hm.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.947
During the time you've worked for him

23:36.982 --> 23:39.182
has he had any other assistant?

23:39.217 --> 23:40.584
No, never.

23:40.619 --> 23:42.185
That wouldn't be necessary.

23:42.220 --> 23:44.288
I do everything
for him. I mean,

23:44.323 --> 23:47.691
I'm his official assistant
since the beginning.

23:47.726 --> 23:49.726
Did that strike you as a weird question?

23:49.761 --> 23:51.795
No, I'm here to help you.

23:51.830 --> 23:52.996
Fine.

23:53.031 --> 23:54.598
There's been no one else.

23:54.633 --> 23:56.567
No one else.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.201
What was your relationship

23:58.236 --> 24:01.138
with the little girl?
Were you a nanny to her?

24:01.173 --> 24:01.939
-No.

24:01.974 --> 24:06.109
No. I didn't deal
with her much.

24:06.144 --> 24:08.078
Mostly with the ambassador.

24:08.113 --> 24:11.715
Who dealt with her?

24:11.750 --> 24:15.886
Her mother.
Mostly her mother.

24:15.921 --> 24:17.220
-Good mother?

24:17.255 --> 24:18.922
Very good mother.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.624
So you had no relationship

24:20.659 --> 24:21.925
with the little girl?

24:21.960 --> 24:24.628
Well, I see her now and then but

24:24.663 --> 24:27.030
my relationship was a
professional relationship

24:27.065 --> 24:28.632
with the ambassador.

24:28.667 --> 24:30.133
Thank you.

24:30.168 --> 24:31.902
Any time. If you
need anything,

24:31.937 --> 24:34.304
please don't hesitate to call me.

24:34.339 --> 24:35.372
Thank you.

24:35.407 --> 24:36.907
-Thank you.

24:36.942 --> 24:41.178
Problem with our business,

24:41.213 --> 24:43.380
when you make a mistake, when you fuck up,

24:43.415 --> 24:45.248
no matter how big or how little that mistake,

24:45.283 --> 24:47.985
everyone wants to reprimand you.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.920
Just kick you when you're down.

24:49.955 --> 24:53.757
How come you haven't?

24:53.792 --> 24:58.062
I didn't need to. You
reprimanded yourself.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.427
How are you doing, guys?

25:30.462 --> 25:32.162
Gentlemen.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.364
I found the headphones
that belong to the girl.

25:34.399 --> 25:36.667
And something here, I don't know

25:36.702 --> 25:38.368
if it's important or not important,

25:38.403 --> 25:40.003
but it's a piece of plastic,

25:40.038 --> 25:41.905
heavy Gauge, it could be industrial.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.674
Thought I'd check it out at the lab.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.676
- That's it?
- That's it.

25:45.711 --> 25:50.147
Anything on the security cameras?

25:50.182 --> 25:52.282
We got one camera, we pulled some stuff.

25:52.317 --> 25:53.984
Take a look.

26:02.127 --> 26:04.127
There's not much there.

26:04.162 --> 26:06.263
- How many cameras were there?

26:06.298 --> 26:08.231
One.

26:08.266 --> 26:10.267
So whoever did this..

26:10.302 --> 26:12.969
Fucking cold..

26:13.004 --> 26:15.338
Whoever did this knew this inside out.

26:15.373 --> 26:17.941
Can't see the face, the
make or model of the car.

26:17.976 --> 26:20.711
See if we can zoom right
in and see the paint,

26:20.746 --> 26:23.113
'cause usually specific
paints are specific to

26:23.148 --> 26:25.449
years and maybe we can
get something like that.

26:25.484 --> 26:26.883
You're still doing that?

26:26.918 --> 26:28.819
I gotta put something in my mouth.

26:28.854 --> 26:30.353
It's better than sucking on a cock.

26:32.758 --> 26:36.426
Captain.. I don't
think we're gonna

26:36.461 --> 26:39.162
get anything else here
in this scene, alright?

26:39.197 --> 26:41.264
It's an abduction.
Break it down.

26:41.299 --> 26:43.333
It's up to you, it's your call.

26:43.368 --> 26:46.937
So, uh, it's an abduction.

26:46.972 --> 26:48.505
We don't know if it's a kidnapping,

26:48.540 --> 26:50.207
if it's for money, or..

26:50.242 --> 26:52.743
You know, right away we
tapped the ambassador's

26:52.778 --> 26:55.078
phones in case somebody calls.

26:55.113 --> 26:56.279
Good thinking.

26:56.314 --> 26:58.381
Can we have our people get some ears

26:58.416 --> 27:00.350
on that too, have a listen in?

27:00.385 --> 27:03.186
Can we also maybe get a
copy of the surveillance

27:03.221 --> 27:05.522
footage? It'd be
nice to analyze that.

27:05.557 --> 27:08.425
Maybe we can get some teamwork and try to

27:08.460 --> 27:11.128
expedite this 'cause
we have a young gir-

27:11.163 --> 27:12.462
where's he going?

27:12.497 --> 27:14.097
Bar.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.966
For what, a drink?

27:16.001 --> 27:18.268
10:45 in the morning
he's going to drink?

27:18.303 --> 27:21.071
Yeah... yeah.

27:21.106 --> 27:23.240
We're trying to find a young girl

27:23.275 --> 27:25.342
and he's going to a bar?!

27:25.377 --> 27:27.444
The lead investigator's an alcoholic.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.312
You know what?

27:29.347 --> 27:31.148
He's better than all of you put together.

27:31.183 --> 27:32.449
Alright?

27:34.953 --> 27:38.989
Crack team..
Crack team.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.431
We're closed!

27:56.842 --> 27:58.008
Really?

27:58.043 --> 27:59.309
We're closed!

28:08.887 --> 28:11.155
Thanks, I appreciate it.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.567
So.. What's up?

28:23.602 --> 28:28.505
We're, uh, investigating over there

28:28.540 --> 28:30.373
and I just saw the bar.

28:30.408 --> 28:31.508
I'm sorry.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.879
Is that Johnny Walker blue?

28:35.914 --> 28:37.581
Yeah, it is.

28:37.616 --> 28:40.183
Put it on the table, please.

28:40.218 --> 28:42.085
Uh, look, I can't do that.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.087
Number one, it's illegal to drink

28:44.122 --> 28:46.156
before 11:00 in a bar.
I can't serve you.

28:46.191 --> 28:48.058
Number two, it's my boss's.

28:48.093 --> 28:50.493
Tell your boss if he's got a problem with it

28:50.528 --> 28:52.429
to contact me, okay?

28:52.464 --> 28:54.497
Bring the bottle here, please.

28:54.532 --> 28:57.934
On the rocks?

28:57.969 --> 29:00.604
Yeah, give me a glass of ice, please.

29:08.313 --> 29:10.447
It's $40.

29:10.482 --> 29:14.184
That's for you.

29:14.219 --> 29:16.553
Put the glass here, I'll pour it myself.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.589
So you get busy here?

29:19.624 --> 29:25.028
Only Thursdays when the
welfare checks come in.

29:25.063 --> 29:29.232
You've worked here a long time?

29:29.267 --> 29:31.301
Too long.

29:31.336 --> 29:32.602
Cheers.

29:32.637 --> 29:34.104
-Cheers.

29:42.681 --> 29:44.347
Let me ask you something.

29:44.382 --> 29:46.116
This table here..

29:46.151 --> 29:47.651
Do people sit at that table?

29:47.686 --> 29:49.085
Yeah.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.121
It's a regular table, right?

29:51.156 --> 29:52.589
That's right.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.557
When's the last time somebody sat there?

29:54.592 --> 29:57.060
Yesterday.

29:57.095 --> 29:58.628
I had a customer sit there yesterday.

29:58.663 --> 30:00.297
Nobody's been here yet today,

30:00.332 --> 30:01.665
I'm just opening now.

30:01.700 --> 30:03.133
What'd they look like?

30:03.168 --> 30:04.668
I don't know, I didn't really look.

30:04.703 --> 30:06.436
Couldn't see him.

30:06.471 --> 30:09.172
He was wearing a baseball cap, a hood..

30:09.207 --> 30:10.340
He was wearing a baseball cap?

30:10.375 --> 30:11.608
-Yeah.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.710
Was it a black baseball cap?

30:13.745 --> 30:17.080
I can't say for sure.

30:17.115 --> 30:19.015
Did it have an insignia?

30:19.050 --> 30:21.084
Did you see a red maple leaf on it?

30:21.119 --> 30:22.585
Yeah, it had a maple leaf.

30:22.620 --> 30:25.188
It had a maple leaf.

30:25.223 --> 30:26.489
What did he order?

30:26.524 --> 30:28.158
A beer.

30:28.193 --> 30:30.560
A beer and actually it was kind of strange

30:30.595 --> 30:34.397
because he asked for a
Canadian beer and usually

30:34.432 --> 30:37.233
people just say "beer" or
they'll say the name of a

30:37.268 --> 30:39.502
brand but they don't ask for a Canadian beer.

30:39.537 --> 30:40.737
Did he have gloves on?

30:40.772 --> 30:42.539
Yeah.

30:42.574 --> 30:43.707
Did he have the gloves on

30:43.742 --> 30:45.976
when he was drinking the beer?

30:46.011 --> 30:47.510
Yeah, he drank the beer with gloves.

30:47.545 --> 30:49.012
How many beers did he have?

30:49.047 --> 30:50.714
Just one.

30:50.749 --> 30:52.415
Where's that bottle?

30:52.450 --> 30:54.384
It'd be with the empties.

30:54.419 --> 30:56.186
Is it still here?

30:56.221 --> 30:58.488
Yeah, they don't pick up 'til Friday.

31:09.367 --> 31:11.635
Fuck, pick up your fucking phone.

31:20.178 --> 31:25.115
Rob, it's al. I'm
across the street.

31:25.150 --> 31:28.018
He was here.
Get everybody.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.519
Shut it down, lock it down,

31:29.554 --> 31:32.022
get everybody
here now. Please.

31:32.057 --> 31:35.725
Listen, you're gonna take
the rest of the day off

31:35.760 --> 31:37.460
'cause this is a crime scene.

31:37.495 --> 31:38.661
You're a good lady.

31:38.696 --> 31:40.130
You did something really good today.

31:40.165 --> 31:42.132
Probably saved the life of a little girl

31:42.167 --> 31:43.800
or at least gave her a chance.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.468
You ever been to the blind swine?

31:45.503 --> 31:47.337
It's always packed.

31:47.372 --> 31:49.672
I'll get you a job there, I know the manager.

31:49.707 --> 31:51.241
You go to the manager, you say

31:51.276 --> 31:53.777
you're a good friend of
alfonse palermo, okay?

31:53.812 --> 31:57.280
That's my card. You
can put that away.

31:57.315 --> 31:59.182
-Thank you.

32:08.793 --> 32:10.693
You need to leave
now. This place

32:10.728 --> 32:13.263
is gonna be crawling with CSI and cops.

32:13.298 --> 32:14.798
-Sure.

32:14.833 --> 32:18.568
Is that your coat?

32:18.603 --> 32:21.038
- Yeah, it's my coat.

32:28.379 --> 32:30.680
Uh, good luck with the investigation.

32:30.715 --> 32:32.782
I hope you find the girl.

32:32.817 --> 32:36.119
Hey, listen, if you need to ask me further

32:36.154 --> 32:37.821
questions I can give you my phone number.

32:37.856 --> 32:39.422
That won't be necessary.

32:39.457 --> 32:41.157
If I need to get a hold of you

32:41.192 --> 32:42.625
I'll see you at the blind swine.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.461
Okay? Thanks
for everything.

32:44.496 --> 32:45.662
You did a good thing today.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.097
-Thanks.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.165
Okay?

33:05.650 --> 33:06.883
Al, what do you got?

33:06.918 --> 33:08.651
-He was here.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.522
He was here.

33:12.557 --> 33:14.657
How do you know that?

33:14.692 --> 33:18.695
How do I know that?
For the last week,

33:18.730 --> 33:20.830
maybe two weeks, maybe even longer,

33:20.865 --> 33:24.200
he sat there and watched you pick her up

33:24.235 --> 33:27.237
every single night from school.

33:27.272 --> 33:30.807
Great view of the alley and great view of

33:30.842 --> 33:33.176
where you come around the corner

33:33.211 --> 33:35.512
from the ambassador's house.

33:35.547 --> 33:38.548
He watched you.
He was here.

33:38.583 --> 33:43.820
She described him, the
bar manager, exactly like

33:43.855 --> 33:46.856
the images we saw from the security camera.

33:46.891 --> 33:48.858
Sir, could I ask you a question?

33:48.893 --> 33:52.195
Please..
Call me al.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.731
Al..

33:54.766 --> 33:57.634
Do you know if he had a drink?

33:57.669 --> 33:59.669
He did have a drink.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.838
He babied a beer every time he was here.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.507
No glass. Drank it
out of the bottle,

34:04.542 --> 34:06.376
and he kept his gloves on.

34:06.411 --> 34:09.779
So we have DNA.

34:09.813 --> 34:12.181
Do you have the beer bottle?

34:12.217 --> 34:13.483
-They're all here.

34:13.518 --> 34:15.185
We're gonna take everything

34:15.219 --> 34:16.585
out of this place.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.353
What do you need, al?

34:18.389 --> 34:20.657
Take a look.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.324
What do you see there?

34:22.360 --> 34:24.226
Come here. Please.

34:38.676 --> 34:40.643
Looks exactly like the
piece of plastic we found

34:40.678 --> 34:42.779
in the alleyway.

34:42.813 --> 34:44.648
And that ain't no coincidence.

34:56.327 --> 35:01.397
That's impressive work.
A little unorthodox.

35:07.372 --> 35:08.705
Hey!

35:08.740 --> 35:09.973
Excuse me.
Hang on, bud.

35:10.008 --> 35:12.475
Sir! Sir?

35:12.510 --> 35:16.546
Sir.. Sir!

35:16.581 --> 35:17.814
Police!

35:17.849 --> 35:19.949
You son of a
fucking bitch! Sir!

35:26.557 --> 35:28.958
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

35:28.993 --> 35:30.526
Come here.

35:30.561 --> 35:32.362
Why are you running?

35:32.397 --> 35:33.997
Why are you chasing me?

35:34.032 --> 35:36.733
'Cause we're the police, buddy.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.701
If we tell you to stop you gotta stop.

35:38.736 --> 35:42.472
Sorry we scared you.

35:42.507 --> 35:44.007
Let him go.
Cut him loose.

35:44.042 --> 35:45.041
-Okay.

35:45.076 --> 35:46.776
What? You're
letting him go?

35:46.811 --> 35:49.246
I don't know..
His call.

36:03.027 --> 36:04.494
Yeah?

36:04.529 --> 36:05.862
Director, he's not here.

36:05.897 --> 36:07.730
He would not-

36:07.765 --> 36:12.535
yeah? Okay.

36:12.570 --> 36:15.638
Alright, got it.

36:17.975 --> 36:20.310
Just got a call-

36:20.345 --> 36:21.577
did you get anything?

36:21.612 --> 36:23.646
Hold on, I got something more important.

36:23.681 --> 36:25.682
The director just called,
he's got a flight for you

36:25.717 --> 36:27.617
booked from Pearson to la.

36:27.652 --> 36:29.052
You gotta go now.
You gotta leave.

36:29.087 --> 36:30.853
I'm not going to la.

36:30.888 --> 36:32.922
Al, do me a
favor. Just go.

36:32.957 --> 36:34.691
We just started the investigation.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.559
Director wants you to go there.

36:36.594 --> 36:38.428
The director can go piss in the wind.

36:38.463 --> 36:39.962
Al, come on. Don't
start that shit.

36:39.997 --> 36:41.731
- What are you gonna be doing?

36:41.766 --> 36:43.766
I'm gonna hold the fort, buddy.

36:43.801 --> 36:49.739
- Okay, do me a favor, I'll get out of here.

36:49.774 --> 36:52.041
You gotta keep me in the loop.

36:52.076 --> 36:53.843
- Of course, just go.

36:53.878 --> 36:57.880
Gotta put a tail on that guy.

36:57.915 --> 37:01.651
- Done. It's all
done, buddy. Go.

37:26.444 --> 37:27.711
Miss Stewart?

37:29.514 --> 37:30.980
Miss Stewart?

37:33.184 --> 37:34.951
I'm inspector alfonse palermo.

37:34.986 --> 37:37.120
I'm really sorry I startled you.

37:37.155 --> 37:40.423
The state department's given me permission to

37:40.458 --> 37:43.493
interview you about the disappearance of

37:43.528 --> 37:45.795
ambassador Adams' daughter.

37:45.830 --> 37:52.735
Um.. I'm here
to discuss, um..

37:52.770 --> 37:55.972
You know ambassador Adams?

37:56.007 --> 38:01.577
I mean, it's no secret here in Los Angeles

38:01.612 --> 38:04.113
you had an affair with him.

38:04.148 --> 38:06.015
So you know him.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.386
Yes.

38:12.023 --> 38:15.591
When's the last time you saw the ambassador?

38:15.626 --> 38:18.928
Been a while.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.898
I don't want to insult your intelligence,

38:21.933 --> 38:24.901
but we can pull all the
video feeds from all the

38:24.936 --> 38:26.803
cameras that are in the elevators

38:26.838 --> 38:28.704
and all along the hall.

38:28.739 --> 38:31.107
We know that the ambassador landed an hour

38:31.142 --> 38:35.178
before me last night here in Los Angeles.

38:35.213 --> 38:37.113
So I'm gonna ask you again.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.615
If we're gonna get along
we gotta be honest with

38:39.650 --> 38:41.751
each other and I'm gonna
be straight with you.

38:41.786 --> 38:43.820
You gotta be straight with me, so...

38:43.855 --> 38:46.489
When's the last time you saw the ambassador?

38:46.524 --> 38:48.224
Did you see him last night?

38:48.259 --> 38:49.959
Yes.

39:00.271 --> 39:01.504
It's me.

39:08.546 --> 39:10.513
Baby, what are you doing here?

39:10.548 --> 39:12.248
You didn't call.

39:12.283 --> 39:14.050
You want me to leave?

39:14.085 --> 39:16.152
No, of course not.
No, I don't want you to-

39:34.539 --> 39:36.706
make love to me this time.

39:36.741 --> 39:38.975
That ship has already sailed.

40:03.935 --> 40:07.670
Baby, how about spending the night tonight?

40:07.705 --> 40:10.673
Just this one time?

40:10.708 --> 40:13.943
You know I can't do that.

40:13.978 --> 40:16.646
I got a lot of stuff to take care of.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.214
I gotta see my mother

40:18.249 --> 40:20.750
and I gotta get back to Canada.

40:20.785 --> 40:25.588
I'll give you this..
I love you.

40:25.623 --> 40:27.890
..More than
my hand.

40:41.038 --> 40:43.072
Did he stay over night?

40:43.107 --> 40:45.841
No.

40:45.876 --> 40:49.912
But he came to see you.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.347
Yes.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.215
Do you still have a relationship

40:53.250 --> 40:55.017
going on with him?

40:55.052 --> 40:56.619
No.

40:56.654 --> 40:58.721
So why did he come and see you last night?

40:58.756 --> 41:00.756
Just to say hello?

41:00.791 --> 41:03.826
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

41:03.861 --> 41:06.829
Thank you for seeing me.

41:06.864 --> 41:10.199
Again, I apologize for barging in like this.

41:10.234 --> 41:14.737
Thank you.

41:14.772 --> 41:16.005
Hi.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.106
Um..

41:17.141 --> 41:19.075
My name is, uh,

41:19.110 --> 41:23.613
inspector alfonse palermo from Canada.

41:23.648 --> 41:26.782
I have permission granted
from the state department

41:26.817 --> 41:29.719
to interview
Mrs. Adams on the

41:29.754 --> 41:32.355
disappearance of her granddaughter in Canada.

41:32.390 --> 41:34.223
Mm hm. I'll
be right back.

41:39.864 --> 41:41.263
Okay, you can keep this,

41:41.298 --> 41:43.132
come on in and stay close to me.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.101
-Sure.

41:45.136 --> 41:48.337
Mr. Adams, an
honor and a pleasure

41:48.372 --> 41:50.206
to meet you, sir.

41:50.241 --> 41:52.341
I want to thank you so much for allowing me

41:52.376 --> 41:54.176
in your home.

41:54.211 --> 41:58.648
I'll let you know the dates that are

41:58.683 --> 42:00.316
open for me.

42:00.351 --> 42:03.986
Sit down.
Sit down.

42:04.021 --> 42:07.823
No, I won't, I promise.

42:07.858 --> 42:10.426
No, I'll just tell you
the dates that I do have

42:10.461 --> 42:13.195
and then see if it works for you

42:13.230 --> 42:15.998
and then we'll work a plan.

42:16.033 --> 42:18.301
Yeah, yeah, okay.

42:27.411 --> 42:31.013
Mrs. Adams, I know this
is a difficult situation

42:31.048 --> 42:34.450
but I want to thank you so much to you

42:34.485 --> 42:36.752
and your husband and the state department

42:36.787 --> 42:38.854
for allowing me to interview you here.

42:38.889 --> 42:41.290
I didn't allow you to interview me here.

42:41.325 --> 42:44.093
I was talked into it.

42:44.128 --> 42:46.729
Mrs. Adams, I'm sorry
you feel like that,

42:46.764 --> 42:51.033
but my partner and our CSI group

42:51.068 --> 42:53.469
are in Canada right now
working around the clock.

42:53.504 --> 42:57.073
I'm here just to try to
see if there's anybody

42:57.108 --> 42:59.709
you would think that would have a motive.

42:59.744 --> 43:01.310
No one would have a motive.

43:01.345 --> 43:03.813
Everybody loves my son.

43:03.848 --> 43:06.816
Nobody would hurt
him. Nobody!

43:06.851 --> 43:07.950
I don't have time for this.

43:07.985 --> 43:09.819
I really don't.

43:09.854 --> 43:11.921
Who are you calling, ma'am?

43:11.956 --> 43:16.225
I'm calling the president, that's who.

43:16.260 --> 43:17.860
John?

43:17.895 --> 43:20.329
My granddaughter is missing.

43:20.364 --> 43:22.031
I've been briefed.

43:22.066 --> 43:25.267
And you send me Canadian
bacon who couldn't find

43:25.302 --> 43:28.337
his ass if he had magnifying glasses.

43:28.372 --> 43:30.740
I understand.

43:30.775 --> 43:33.843
We got you elected, John, and we can

43:33.878 --> 43:36.278
get you out of that seat easy.

43:36.313 --> 43:39.949
The Canadians have jurisdiction.

43:39.984 --> 43:43.753
In fact, Mrs. Adams,
the commissioner is

43:43.788 --> 43:46.055
a personal friend of mine.

43:46.090 --> 43:48.357
I need to have the FBI look for my

43:48.392 --> 43:52.061
granddaughter, not guys
parading in red outfits.

43:52.096 --> 43:54.864
You can hear me but you're not listening.

43:54.899 --> 43:57.032
We will support the Canadians

43:57.067 --> 43:59.201
and do everything possible to get

43:59.236 --> 44:02.271
your granddaughter back home and safe.

44:02.306 --> 44:04.173
Yes, Mr. president.

44:12.516 --> 44:14.316
Ask your questions.

44:14.351 --> 44:15.985
Thank you.
Thank you, ma'am.

44:16.020 --> 44:19.855
Um, this girl that claimed that she was

44:19.890 --> 44:22.024
abused and manipulated by your son

44:22.059 --> 44:23.926
and it was in all the papers..

44:23.961 --> 44:25.928
Does she still live in Los Angeles?

44:25.963 --> 44:27.129
Yes.

44:27.164 --> 44:31.834
Is there any truth that your family's paying

44:31.869 --> 44:33.803
for all her expenses?

44:33.838 --> 44:35.971
Who told you that?

44:36.006 --> 44:38.941
Mrs. Adams, you
need to humor me.

44:38.976 --> 44:41.477
Your son has some enemies.

44:41.512 --> 44:44.113
Listen, if you speak about my son one more

44:44.148 --> 44:46.816
time I'm gonna ask you to leave my house.

44:46.851 --> 44:48.184
Everybody loves him.

44:48.219 --> 44:50.085
Nobody would be mean to him.

44:50.120 --> 44:52.254
Ma'am, we're not trying to say anything bad

44:52.289 --> 44:53.956
about your son.

44:53.991 --> 44:56.091
We're just trying to find
out who his enemies are,

44:56.126 --> 44:57.560
who would have
motive to try-

44:57.595 --> 44:59.428
he has no enemies!

44:59.463 --> 45:01.096
You understand what I'm saying?

45:01.131 --> 45:03.800
Stop talking about my son.

45:06.303 --> 45:07.870
It means the same thing in Canada

45:07.905 --> 45:09.371
as it does in the us.

45:09.406 --> 45:11.574
You're out of here,
pal. Let's go.

45:11.609 --> 45:14.210
Let's go..
There ya go.

45:14.245 --> 45:16.579
Not moving fast enough.

45:16.614 --> 45:18.247
Have a good day, sir.

45:37.534 --> 45:42.471
Ryan. It's
George down here.

45:42.506 --> 45:44.506
How ya doing, buddy?

45:44.541 --> 45:47.276
No, I don't want any bacon.

45:47.311 --> 45:53.115
I need a little help.
What I've gotten so far

45:53.150 --> 45:55.517
is that there's a guy up there

45:55.552 --> 45:59.188
that's got expertise with, as you know,

45:59.223 --> 46:02.058
what's going on with my granddaughter.

46:03.994 --> 46:06.262
You did?

46:08.299 --> 46:13.302
Who put him
on a plane? Me?

46:13.337 --> 46:17.339
You? Well, I'm
not paying then.

46:17.374 --> 46:20.109
Hey, buddy, I love you, okay?

46:20.144 --> 46:22.979
I'll let you know when I meet him.

46:27.584 --> 46:28.951
How are you doing?

46:28.986 --> 46:30.653
The senator's expecting you.

46:30.688 --> 46:32.254
-Okay.

46:54.445 --> 46:55.644
I'm sorry.

46:55.679 --> 46:57.346
I know I should have called first.

46:57.381 --> 46:59.248
You don't have to call, honey.

46:59.283 --> 47:00.582
Just come home.

47:00.617 --> 47:05.054
Um, sit, please.

47:05.089 --> 47:08.223
Mom, I'm under a lot
of pressure. They're

47:08.258 --> 47:11.660
trying to depict me as some sort of monster.

47:11.695 --> 47:13.429
I'm doing everything I can

47:13.464 --> 47:15.197
to find my daughter, Jenny.

47:15.232 --> 47:16.699
I'm doing everything I can, mom.

47:16.734 --> 47:18.500
I know, darling.

47:18.535 --> 47:20.569
You're a great father and a great son.

47:23.240 --> 47:25.107
Has anybody been here?

47:25.142 --> 47:27.476
Yes, a whole bunch of people came from Canada

47:27.511 --> 47:30.212
and came to see me.

47:30.247 --> 47:33.749
Mother, I'm gonna need your support in this.

47:33.784 --> 47:36.385
My own wife, Margaret, has turned against me.

47:36.420 --> 47:38.554
She thinks I had something to do with..

47:38.589 --> 47:39.989
With Jenny's abduction.

47:40.024 --> 47:41.657
I don't know what I'm gonna do, mom.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.425
The world is turning on me here!

47:43.460 --> 47:46.228
You egotistical..

47:46.263 --> 47:50.666
Self-centered,
lying prick.

47:50.701 --> 47:53.135
You disgust me.

47:59.643 --> 48:02.177
Don't you dare give a flying fuck

48:02.212 --> 48:05.581
what your father says.

48:14.358 --> 48:15.457
How you doing?

48:15.492 --> 48:17.259
-What's up, buddy?

48:17.294 --> 48:23.499
So..

48:23.534 --> 48:26.168
He's capable.

48:26.203 --> 48:31.073
Good. But..?

48:31.108 --> 48:33.142
No but.

48:33.177 --> 48:35.444
He's just, uh, damaged goods.

48:38.348 --> 48:41.417
He lost his wife and daughter

48:41.452 --> 48:45.487
couple of years
ago. An accident.

48:45.522 --> 48:48.657
Got problems.

48:48.692 --> 48:51.393
What kind of
problems? Drugs?

48:51.428 --> 48:54.596
No, drinks.

48:54.631 --> 48:57.466
Well, we all drink, right?

49:00.771 --> 49:02.704
I think..

49:02.739 --> 49:04.073
-What?

49:04.108 --> 49:07.843
His job is what's keeping him alive.

49:07.878 --> 49:11.246
To me that's a..
He's an asset.

49:11.281 --> 49:13.816
I know nothing about Canada, you know?

49:13.851 --> 49:16.718
I know they made hockey a law.

49:16.753 --> 49:18.854
Let me stop you here for a sec.

49:18.889 --> 49:21.723
You, I'm interested in what you think.

49:21.758 --> 49:24.526
What do you think about him?

49:24.561 --> 49:26.662
I think we're gonna go with him.

49:26.697 --> 49:28.330
You think?

49:28.365 --> 49:32.167
-Yeah.

49:32.202 --> 49:36.238
That's good enough for me.

49:40.811 --> 49:41.877
Senator..

49:41.912 --> 49:45.547
Gentlemen.

49:45.582 --> 49:48.317
Which one of you two is palermo?

49:48.352 --> 49:50.819
You. Your name?

49:50.854 --> 49:53.322
Robert Santos.

49:53.357 --> 49:56.558
Robert, would you mind, um..

49:56.593 --> 49:59.261
Leaving us alone?

49:59.296 --> 50:02.364
No disrespect.

50:02.399 --> 50:04.233
Thank you, my friend.

50:14.945 --> 50:19.448
Sir.

50:19.483 --> 50:21.383
How are you?

50:21.418 --> 50:22.251
Good.

50:26.823 --> 50:30.859
I'm just thinking.
Just thinking.

50:30.894 --> 50:33.762
See, the nice thing about thinking is

50:33.797 --> 50:36.465
you don't have to talk.

50:36.500 --> 50:38.400
So now I've thought about it..

50:38.435 --> 50:40.936
Um, why don't you have a seat.

50:40.971 --> 50:42.838
Thank you, sir.

50:48.612 --> 50:50.812
So how do we start this?

50:50.847 --> 50:55.617
What qualifies you above
everyone else as someone

50:55.652 --> 50:59.421
who can help me find my granddaughter?

50:59.456 --> 51:02.891
I don't know if my qualifications are up and

51:02.926 --> 51:05.794
above everyone else, but I'm good at my job.

51:05.829 --> 51:10.766
I've been doing it for 27 years

51:10.801 --> 51:14.236
and my dad did it for 55 years.

51:14.271 --> 51:18.974
And I know my city, I know my province,

51:19.009 --> 51:21.910
and I know my
country inside-out.

51:21.945 --> 51:28.250
And I work 15 hour days
'cause that's all I have.

51:28.285 --> 51:32.354
You want a scotch?

51:32.389 --> 51:35.824
Sure. If you
don't mind.

51:35.859 --> 51:37.893
I don't mind.
Help yourself.

52:00.917 --> 52:02.784
- Chen don.
- Chen don.

52:02.819 --> 52:03.852
Cheers.

52:10.894 --> 52:12.995
Question.

52:13.030 --> 52:14.863
Um..

52:14.898 --> 52:18.400
How much do you drink while you work?

52:27.744 --> 52:31.546
Excuse me. I
asked a question.

52:31.581 --> 52:33.415
It depends, sir.

52:33.450 --> 52:35.384
-Depends on what?

52:35.419 --> 52:37.686
Depends on which day it is.

52:37.721 --> 52:39.988
Which day-so
there's specific days

52:40.023 --> 52:42.357
where you drink more or less?

52:42.392 --> 52:43.725
Yes.

52:43.760 --> 52:46.028
Whether you're on a case or not?

52:46.063 --> 52:48.997
Whether I'm on a case or not, sir.

52:49.032 --> 52:54.670
Sir, the only thing I
have right now is my job

52:54.705 --> 52:56.738
'cause my family's not here.

52:56.773 --> 52:59.007
I want you to listen to me now carefully.

52:59.042 --> 53:03.879
I have nothing but deep
sorrow for what happened

53:03.914 --> 53:06.715
to you and your family
and.. It hurts.

53:06.750 --> 53:08.717
Oh, yeah.

53:08.752 --> 53:10.519
But you have to understand

53:10.554 --> 53:13.889
that I'm now in..

53:13.924 --> 53:17.726
I'm now in a spot that you unfortunately

53:17.761 --> 53:19.861
have been in, okay?

53:19.896 --> 53:21.797
So I hope you understand that

53:21.832 --> 53:23.865
I'm not insulting you when I ask you..

53:23.900 --> 53:29.771
If you drink beyond your capabilities

53:29.806 --> 53:32.040
to do the job?

53:32.075 --> 53:35.410
Sir.. Straight up?

53:35.445 --> 53:39.748
If I can't do my job I will stay home.

53:39.783 --> 53:42.751
But I do my job every day, and right now

53:42.786 --> 53:48.023
I only have one file on my desk

53:48.058 --> 53:51.093
and that's your granddaughter, sir.

53:51.128 --> 53:52.961
That's my mandate.

53:59.903 --> 54:02.637
I like you, son.

54:02.672 --> 54:04.573
-Thank you, sir.

54:11.047 --> 54:14.649
You know, senator..
I want to thank you

54:14.684 --> 54:19.388
for inviting me here to your lovely house

54:19.423 --> 54:22.057
and speaking to me.
And actually..

54:22.092 --> 54:24.826
Actually, sir, I have to be honest with you.

54:24.861 --> 54:27.496
I find it refreshing that
you have confidence in me

54:27.531 --> 54:29.097
and I will do my best.

54:29.132 --> 54:31.466
I will do my best, sir.

54:31.501 --> 54:33.034
I gotta get back,

54:33.069 --> 54:35.904
and thank you for sending a plane for us.

54:40.677 --> 54:44.780
You do your best.

54:44.815 --> 54:46.482
I will, sir.

54:54.825 --> 54:56.058
Thank you, sir.

55:11.975 --> 55:13.642
I don't want to go in there

55:13.677 --> 55:14.910
and do this time, man.

55:14.945 --> 55:17.078
You know, they do..

55:17.113 --> 55:20.015
They do really terrible
things to people like me

55:20.050 --> 55:22.017
and I'm scared...

55:22.052 --> 55:24.553
I'm really scared.

55:24.588 --> 55:27.722
Isn't there some other place

55:27.757 --> 55:29.991
they could take me to maybe

55:30.026 --> 55:33.862
and not put me in the general population?

55:37.801 --> 55:39.201
I'm sorry!

55:39.236 --> 55:41.937
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it!

55:41.972 --> 55:45.674
Can you help me?

55:45.709 --> 55:48.877
I know they were young, but..

55:48.912 --> 55:57.085
I can't help it.
I can't help it.

55:57.120 --> 56:01.490
I'm sorry!

56:01.525 --> 56:04.092
You know what?

56:04.127 --> 56:07.195
You know what? Fuck
yourselves, you guys.

56:07.230 --> 56:10.665
Fuck yourselves
'cause I'll go in and-

56:10.700 --> 56:14.536
I'll go in. I'll go
in and.. Fuck you!

56:32.289 --> 56:38.827
Why am I here? This
is a retro disco bar

56:38.862 --> 56:40.996
and I don't want to be here.

56:41.031 --> 56:42.731
There's a gift for you here that comes

56:42.766 --> 56:44.633
gift wrapped, do you understand?

56:44.668 --> 56:45.834
What kind of gift is that?

56:45.869 --> 56:48.069
The biggest - I
said the biggest -

56:48.104 --> 56:50.705
pedophile in the entire
fuckin' world is in this

56:50.740 --> 56:53.808
fuckin' room right now, you understand me?

56:53.843 --> 56:55.277
And what do you think he likes?

56:55.312 --> 56:56.611
Little girls in kilts?

56:56.646 --> 56:57.812
Exactly.

56:57.847 --> 56:59.814
When do you think he was released?

56:59.849 --> 57:01.950
You tell me. You
know everything.

57:01.985 --> 57:03.785
Friday. That tell
you something?

57:03.820 --> 57:05.186
Where is he?

57:05.221 --> 57:06.955
He's right here at the bar.

57:06.990 --> 57:09.024
-Which one is he?

57:09.059 --> 57:11.059
This is fuckin' desperado night.

57:11.094 --> 57:12.994
Right there, the guy
with the fuckin' earring.

57:13.029 --> 57:14.930
Oh, fuck. I
love this song.

57:14.965 --> 57:16.831
I love this fuckin' song.

57:16.866 --> 57:18.199
You're a dancer?

57:18.234 --> 57:21.002
A dancer? Did you
say I'm a dancer?

57:21.037 --> 57:23.071
I make Fred Astaire look like he's in a

57:23.106 --> 57:25.040
fuckin' wheelchair, you understand me?

57:30.080 --> 57:31.079
What are you doing?

57:31.114 --> 57:33.748
What's the matter with you?

57:59.876 --> 58:02.210
Man, do I know you?

58:02.245 --> 58:04.079
No, but I know you.

58:09.986 --> 58:12.787
You're-you're a cop.
You're a cop, man.

58:12.822 --> 58:15.657
Say it.

58:15.692 --> 58:18.126
Special agent,

58:18.161 --> 58:20.195
and I look for little assholes like you.

58:20.230 --> 58:23.865
Isn't she a little too old for you, buddy?

58:23.900 --> 58:25.300
I'm just here with my girlfriend

58:25.335 --> 58:26.935
having some fun.
Alright, guy?

58:26.970 --> 58:28.637
Okay, cop?

58:28.672 --> 58:30.071
I did my time.

58:30.106 --> 58:32.273
Three years.. Three
years I served my time,

58:32.308 --> 58:33.942
cleaned my slate, alright?

58:33.977 --> 58:35.877
So why don't you just back off?

58:35.912 --> 58:39.147
Enjoy your
scotch. Okay?

58:39.182 --> 58:41.049
Back off.

58:41.084 --> 58:42.951
You know that it's
a criminal offense-

58:42.986 --> 58:46.688
ah! Alright,
man, alright.

58:46.723 --> 58:48.356
Alright, alright, alright.

58:48.391 --> 58:50.025
You understand?

58:50.060 --> 58:51.393
I got it, I got it. You
don't like being pushed.

58:51.428 --> 58:52.427
Too bad, jerk.

59:06.309 --> 59:08.376
You know what, you son of a bitch?

59:08.411 --> 59:10.211
You got yourself a first
class ticket to jail.

59:10.246 --> 59:14.115
You can't hit an officer of the law,

59:14.150 --> 59:17.385
you pedophile
bastard. Cocksucker.

59:17.420 --> 59:23.758
Where's my..
Where is it?

59:23.793 --> 59:25.727
There it is.
Right there.

59:25.762 --> 59:28.096
Grab me that, will you?

59:28.131 --> 59:29.464
What the fuck is that?

59:29.499 --> 59:30.999
I'm a popper, man.

59:31.034 --> 59:32.333
What do you mean, a popper?

59:32.368 --> 59:34.036
-I'm a popper!

59:38.908 --> 59:43.745
Um.. A little girl
was abducted

59:43.780 --> 59:46.381
this morning on her way to school.

59:46.416 --> 59:50.285
You, uh, got out on Friday

59:50.320 --> 59:54.456
and your m.O.'S
very clear.

59:54.491 --> 59:56.391
You like little girls with kilts.

59:56.426 --> 59:57.959
You went to prison because of a

59:57.994 --> 59:59.427
13-year-old
girl.

59:59.462 --> 01:00:01.096
So two things are gonna happen.

01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:03.098
Either we're gonna hold you tonight for

01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:04.966
hitting a police officer and put you in jail

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:07.068
which is a breach of your probation,

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:08.937
you understand what I'm saying to you?

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:10.238
So you're gonna fuckin' listen to me.

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:11.740
I don't need to hear your shit.

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:12.974
What is this?

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:14.075
Well, see...

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:14.942
What is this?

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:16.878
Let me show you.
Just let me show you.

01:00:16.913 --> 01:00:17.979
You're my friend, I thought.

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.180
I'm not your friend.

01:00:19.215 --> 01:00:20.982
Alright. I'm a
popper, see?

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:22.283
Pop, pop, pop.

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:23.785
What's a popper?

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.987
Well, it's just like a thing you do,

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:27.822
it's a nervous thing I do.

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:30.358
Sometimes I order big packages to my house

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:32.827
'cause I know it'll be wrapped with

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:34.162
so much popper material.

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:35.964
Can anybody vouch for you,

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:37.499
where you were on Monday?

01:00:37.534 --> 01:00:39.334
Well, yeah.

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:40.802
-Monday morning?

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:42.937
Yeah, Monday morning I
was, uh, I was popping.

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.172
-Okay, stop.

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:47.008
Seriously, my Patience is this thin.

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:48.943
I'll just lock you up and leave.

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:51.079
If you want even a minute chance of

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:53.448
getting your ass back home instead of

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.316
having your ass back there in jail..

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:57.252
Shut the fuck up and listen to me.

01:00:57.287 --> 01:01:00.321
Can somebody vouch for where you were

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:02.190
Monday morning, yes or no?

01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:04.826
Yes, my sister and my
brother in law can vouch.

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:06.795
I live in my sister's garage.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.096
- This is what we're gonna do.

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:10.265
I'm gonna let you
go. You're gonna go.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:12.267
I'm gonna give you my card..

01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:15.036
And I want to hear from you in two days

01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:16.337
because I know you guys..

01:01:16.372 --> 01:01:18.072
Guys like you..

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:20.575
You sick fucks, you share shit.

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.210
You all know each other.

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:24.579
If I don't hear back from you in two days

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:28.049
I'm gonna come get you
and I'm gonna make sure

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:30.051
the assault charges and the

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:32.053
breach of probation are gonna stick.

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:33.922
'Cause I got maybe 100 fuckin' witnesses

01:01:33.957 --> 01:01:36.191
that saw a sick little fuck like you

01:01:36.226 --> 01:01:38.993
assaulting a police officer.

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:40.228
You understand me?

01:01:40.263 --> 01:01:42.030
Yeah, I got you.

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:43.464
Just say "yes", do you understand me?

01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:44.899
Yes.

01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:46.334
You make me fuckin' sick.

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:48.069
If it were up to me I'd fuckin' fix you.

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:50.038
Two fuckin' days.
Three fuckin' days

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:51.940
we don't hear from you, I'm gonna fuckin'

01:01:51.975 --> 01:01:54.542
come and get you.
You hear me?

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:56.077
Yeah, I got it.

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:58.279
Okay, listen. Stay
here, sit tight.

01:01:58.314 --> 01:02:00.081
We're gonna get somebody to process you

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:02.150
and then you can go home.

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:09.524
Hey, thanks for the water.

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.259
- Go fuck yourself.

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:12.493
It's nice water.

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:20.168
Good evening, sir.
Welcome to big red's.

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:21.970
How may I help you?

01:02:22.005 --> 01:02:24.172
I'm meeting
Mrs. Adams here..

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:25.440
For a meeting.

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:27.242
Sorry, I can't let you in there without

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:29.911
a dinner jacket, sir, and shirt and tie.

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:33.548
I can take my jacket off if you want.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:37.118
Uh, no. You can
leave your jacket on.

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:40.088
Bradley, what's going on here?

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:42.557
This gentleman says he
has a meeting with you.

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.058
Well, he's a dear friend of mine.

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:45.526
You have to let him in.

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:47.462
Thank you, Bradley.

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:49.097
Come with me.

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:51.532
Sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you.

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:53.602
Oh, no. Please.

01:02:56.372 --> 01:02:58.339
Your son in law is here.

01:02:58.374 --> 01:03:00.208
Send him in.

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:12.287
Dad, you wanted to see me?

01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:13.588
-Take a seat.

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:19.460
Please have a seat.

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:20.695
-Thank you.

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.430
Thank you for joining
me on such short notice,

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.098
special agent.

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:25.566
Should I call you special agent?

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:27.001
Just call me alfonse.

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:28.603
Or maybe Alfie?

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:30.538
Alfonse is fine, please.

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:32.407
Do you drink wine?

01:03:32.442 --> 01:03:34.142
Yes, I do, actually.

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:35.576
I have a wonderful brunello

01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:37.646
I've ordered for us.

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:53.027
Salud.

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:54.595
Hopefully everything works out for you.

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:55.664
Thank you.

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:03.204
So what did you want to talk about?

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:04.439
Let's order something first.

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:06.074
You know what?

01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:08.509
To be honest with you,
um, I'm not that hungry.

01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:14.148
So what did you want to
talk about, Mrs. Adams?

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:16.417
I saw something in your eyes..

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:18.119
Something familiar.

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:23.992
Probably, uh, in a way can kind of relate to.

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:27.261
I just want to know if my daughter's

01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:29.430
going to be okay.

01:04:29.465 --> 01:04:31.099
We're doing our best.

01:04:31.134 --> 01:04:34.602
I guess I just sometimes
get lonely, you know.

01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:37.105
I know how you feel.

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:40.108
My husband's always traveling and, you know,

01:04:40.143 --> 01:04:43.711
he's always.. He's
just busy working.

01:04:43.746 --> 01:04:46.214
I just saw something in your eyes.

01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:48.249
Mrs. Adams, I came here
because I thought you

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:51.719
wanted to talk about the situation..

01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:54.088
Yes, of course, of course.

01:04:54.123 --> 01:04:56.157
..With your daughter.

01:04:56.192 --> 01:05:03.464
But I really don't understand your, um..

01:05:03.499 --> 01:05:05.500
Line of questioning.

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:08.269
I guess I just wanted company.

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:10.104
That's great.

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:15.576
We don't have to do this if you don't..

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:18.346
Feel comfortable.

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:20.314
I'm really not comfortable.

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:25.520
I mean.. I'm
not comfortable.

01:05:25.555 --> 01:05:27.622
I came here to talk about the case.

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:29.791
Are there any further details,

01:05:29.826 --> 01:05:32.393
or is there any more information?

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:34.429
Any more leads?

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:38.399
Actually, um.. Today
was a good day.

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:44.572
We had surveillance
video on-

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:47.675
actually, I don't think
I want to talk about it.

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:50.111
I don't know what I want.

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:52.747
I'm just really confused right now.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:57.685
Well, if you really want
to help us, and I'm sure

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.254
you do.. Anything
that you can think of.

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:02.824
Right now it's really strange that we haven't

01:06:02.859 --> 01:06:06.260
received any
ransom- or any calls.

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:07.595
No, nothing.

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:11.533
So.. Does your husband
have any enemies?

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:19.373
My husband

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:22.810
yeah, I think maybe there's people out there

01:06:22.845 --> 01:06:24.846
that don't like him.

01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:26.714
Do you think there's anybody out there

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:29.250
that wouldn't like him enough

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:32.186
to hurt him by hurting his family?

01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:33.688
I hope not.

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:41.562
You okay?

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:45.766
Well.. You know
what's going on, right?

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:48.369
Who are you talking to?

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:50.271
Let me tell you something.

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:53.741
If, god forbid..

01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:59.547
God forbid.. I find
out you have anything

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:03.651
whatsoever to do with this whole thing..

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:05.786
Anything.

01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:08.756
Listen to me and look at me.

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:13.294
I will beat you like a
red-headed stepchild.

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:15.730
I will rip your tongue out, okay,

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:17.632
and I'll mail it to your mother.

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:19.467
You understand what I'm saying?

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:21.435
She's my daughter!

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.838
Act like a father.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:27.808
Not some pumped up little pimp that you are.

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:29.577
Okay?

01:07:29.612 --> 01:07:31.445
Am I stupid?

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.314
You're married to my daughter.

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:34.649
Right?

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:37.652
If I wasn't a senator, okay,

01:07:37.687 --> 01:07:40.454
I'd break every bone in your face.

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:43.824
Are we clear?

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:45.760
You behave like a gentleman.

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:47.728
You behave like a father.

01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:49.463
You behave like a man..

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:51.332
Or I'll make you a girl.

01:07:55.304 --> 01:07:56.437
Clear?

01:07:56.472 --> 01:07:59.440
Clear.

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:04.312
Get him out.

01:08:04.347 --> 01:08:05.613
Ambassador..

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:19.493
Look, my husband can be a
real asshole sometimes.

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:20.694
How?

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:22.930
-How?

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:25.233
Yeah, how can he be an asshole?

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:26.934
He's in total control of
himself when he speaks.

01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:28.636
Well, that's what he does, doesn't he?

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:30.004
I don't know your husband.

01:08:30.038 --> 01:08:31.839
You know your husband.

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:35.977
He has a job to do and a facade to put up

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:41.349
and, you know..
People buy into it.

01:08:41.384 --> 01:08:43.751
Mrs. Adams, I don't
mean to be disrespectful.

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.987
You seem like a very nice
lady and very Sincere,

01:08:46.022 --> 01:08:47.689
but why are we here?

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.995
I'll tell you straight up.

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:56.697
I came here as an investigator..

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:58.399
Because I just felt like there was

01:08:58.434 --> 01:09:00.533
nobody else I could talk to.

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:05.640
So if there's anything, um, that you hear,

01:09:05.675 --> 01:09:07.341
if you get a
phone call-

01:09:07.376 --> 01:09:09.042
and I'm just gonna let you know,

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:10.877
uh, out of respect for you..

01:09:10.912 --> 01:09:12.979
Your phones are tapped.

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:14.749
And we didn't tap them
because of anything that

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:16.884
you did, we tapped them
in case somebody calls.

01:09:16.919 --> 01:09:18.953
That's fine, I have nothing to hide.

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:22.456
My husband, on the other hand..

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:24.725
Thank you. Thank
you for the wine.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.493
I'm gonna have to get going.

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:28.429
Take care.

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:29.830
-Thank you.

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:31.499
If you need anything let me know, okay?

01:09:31.533 --> 01:09:32.399
-Of course.

01:09:32.435 --> 01:09:33.901
Thank you.

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:19.513
How could you do this to me?

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:21.382
How could you do this to me?

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:26.621
Al?

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:33.094
I'm so glad you're finally in here.

01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:34.695
-Marianna..

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:37.398
I can't believe you came
in through the back door.

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:39.367
We never use that door.

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:40.701
But I'm glad.

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:42.837
It's two and a half years.

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:44.672
You have to sleep in your own bed now.

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:47.441
You can't sleep on the couch anymore.

01:10:47.476 --> 01:10:49.677
I love you.

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:54.515
Why did you leave me?

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:56.684
Everybody dies, honey.

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:59.787
I was just pushed to the front of the line.

01:11:04.527 --> 01:11:06.093
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm always with you.

01:11:06.128 --> 01:11:08.596
I'm always here with you.

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:10.564
You're not.

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:11.932
I'm here with you.

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:15.703
-It's not real.

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:18.806
Dad, I can't. I
can't go right now.

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:23.477
I need to be
here. Okay?

01:11:23.512 --> 01:11:27.915
No, I know, I know, I know.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:29.750
But I just really need to be here

01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:32.620
in case somebody calls, okay?

01:11:34.924 --> 01:11:37.525
I know everything's gonna be fine.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:42.463
I do. Okay?

01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:46.901
I don't know where he is, I don't know.

01:11:46.936 --> 01:11:49.770
I know, that's what the police said.

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:52.940
They did, they said that in the interview.

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:55.843
They took all the
information. They have-

01:11:55.878 --> 01:12:03.184
yeah, we gave them a picture of her.

01:12:12.962 --> 01:12:15.796
Okay. Alright,
thank you.

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:18.199
I know, I love you too.

01:12:18.234 --> 01:12:20.468
Okay. Alright.

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:23.938
Okay, bye.

01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:35.049
Margaret. What's
the matter?

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:40.554
What's the matter?
What's the matter?!

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:42.723
Are you fucking kidding me?!

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:44.792
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:47.061
Our fucking daughter is gone!

01:12:47.096 --> 01:12:49.897
That's what's the matter, you stupid prick!

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:52.066
You! This is all
because of you!

01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:54.902
You think I'm stupid, don't you?

01:12:54.937 --> 01:12:57.238
You think I'm fucking stupid!

01:12:57.273 --> 01:13:01.575
Find our fucking daughter, you asshole!

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:05.246
Mr. ambassador.. With
all your connections

01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:09.116
and all your people and
all your fucking women.

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:13.621
Get out of my fucking sight now!

01:13:13.656 --> 01:13:14.688
Go!

01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:15.756
Now!

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:18.792
Get out of my fucking sight!

01:13:18.827 --> 01:13:20.495
I hate you.

01:15:00.929 --> 01:15:06.200
Sonny and Cher..
Join me for lunch.

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:33.027
Ahh.

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:02.690
Fuck!

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:05.325
Who is it?!

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.830
<i>Secret service Canada.</i>

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:11.899
Aw, shit.

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:21.175
The door's open, for Christ's sake!

01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:22.976
Please..

01:16:23.011 --> 01:16:29.149
Thank you for coming in on such short notice.

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:33.787
We're dealing with a
case of a missing person.

01:16:33.822 --> 01:16:37.191
We have the abduction of a little girl.

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:41.028
This is secret service agent Sampson.

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:44.231
He's the last person who was with her,

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:47.234
as far as we know.

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:56.510
I'm stuck.
I'm just stuck.

01:16:56.545 --> 01:17:03.884
If you could provide any
kind of initial insight..

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:08.122
I'm gonna let agent Sampson provide you

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:09.857
with some details.

01:17:09.892 --> 01:17:11.925
Okay.

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:30.010
I'm special agent al palermo.

01:17:30.045 --> 01:17:31.945
Sorry to disturb your lunch.

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:33.814
Special agent Robert Santos.

01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:38.919
I thought the FBI was
handling this investigation.

01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:40.788
The abduction occurred in Canada.

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:42.990
Shut up! I'm
talking to him.

01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:46.860
Uh, we're in Canada, it happened in Canada

01:17:46.895 --> 01:17:48.862
so it's Canadian jurisdiction.

01:17:48.897 --> 01:17:50.330
The alleged abduction.
We have no clue

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:52.132
if it is an abduction or a kidnapping,

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:54.001
but we came to ask you some questions.

01:17:54.036 --> 01:17:55.269
But I want to ask you something.

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:57.037
- Well, I'm gonna tell you something.

01:17:57.072 --> 01:17:59.339
I'm about to have my dinner and this is the

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:02.109
high point of my fuckin'
life these days, so..

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:03.510
I apologize.

01:18:03.545 --> 01:18:05.179
A child's life is at stake.

01:18:05.214 --> 01:18:06.814
I want to tell you,

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:09.483
I only have enough for one person, okay?

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:11.585
Fine.
Crystal clear.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:13.120
Let me ask you something..

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:14.855
Why do you leave the door unlocked upstairs?

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:16.223
That's unsafe, sir.

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:18.058
I don't give a shit.

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:20.060
The worst that can happen is I get killed.

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:21.428
Ha ha!

01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:23.330
You were the driver for the family?

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:24.198
Yeah.

01:18:24.233 --> 01:18:25.465
-How long, sir?

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.100
Over 40 years.

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:29.937
Probably close to
50 years. Fuck 'em.

01:18:29.972 --> 01:18:31.505
And how come you're not employed

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.373
by them anymore, sir?

01:18:33.408 --> 01:18:35.542
Because they fired me.

01:18:35.577 --> 01:18:40.180
I was late one fuckin'
time in 40 fuckin' years

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:41.915
and they fired me!

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:44.451
Good afternoon, ambassador.

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:48.622
Hello Florence.

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:52.926
I'm terribly sorry I was late.

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:55.495
I was only a little late.

01:18:55.530 --> 01:18:58.198
I was feeling
ill... sick.

01:18:58.233 --> 01:18:59.499
No problem.

01:18:59.534 --> 01:19:02.035
Thank you.

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:04.037
What are you doing, Florence?

01:19:04.072 --> 01:19:06.607
I'm going to drive the car.

01:19:06.642 --> 01:19:10.344
How can you drive the car
if you don't work for me?

01:19:10.379 --> 01:19:14.081
I don't understand.

01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:16.283
You're fired!

01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:19.620
You fucking idiot!
You left me standing

01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:24.291
on the sidewalk for four minutes!

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:27.160
I'm not trying to upset you, I swear to you.

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:30.097
I came here to get some
background and understand

01:19:30.132 --> 01:19:33.100
your relationship with ambassador Adams.

01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:37.004
Okay. Wonderful
family, nice people.

01:19:37.039 --> 01:19:40.607
Great guy.
They're the, um,

01:19:40.642 --> 01:19:43.543
apple pie of the United States of America.

01:19:43.578 --> 01:19:45.112
Ha ha ha!

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:47.614
You want to hear my version?

01:19:47.649 --> 01:19:49.383
Yes.

01:19:49.418 --> 01:19:53.020
Okay...

01:19:53.055 --> 01:19:56.423
He's a cocksucker.
That's what he is.

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:58.625
Can you expand on that, sir?

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:02.663
Cocksucker could be a lot of things, sir.

01:20:02.698 --> 01:20:04.097
They're a lousy family.

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:06.133
The truth of the matter is they're lousy.

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:08.669
Why would you stay for 40 plus,

01:20:08.704 --> 01:20:10.938
or 50 years with this family?

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:14.174
Because I love their
daughter. That's why.

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:15.375
The ambassador's wife?

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:17.044
No, the kid.

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:18.312
The kid who's missing?

01:20:18.347 --> 01:20:19.579
Yeah.

01:20:19.614 --> 01:20:21.481
What was your relationship with her?

01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:29.723
I loved her. I
was like a grandpa.

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:32.259
Hey, I'd never hurt that kid.

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:36.163
I'd never hurt that
kid. I loved that girl.

01:20:38.734 --> 01:20:41.668
I'd.. I'd
kill him!

01:20:41.703 --> 01:20:44.037
But I wouldn't shoot him.

01:20:44.072 --> 01:20:46.273
That would be too simple.

01:20:46.308 --> 01:20:50.510
I'd crack his fuckin' neck like a nutcracker.

01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:52.679
When did this animosity

01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:55.015
between the two of you start, sir?

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:56.717
I never liked the son of a bitch.

01:20:56.752 --> 01:20:59.019
Even when he was a child?

01:20:59.054 --> 01:21:02.389
He was a shitty kid.

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:13.100
Turn that fuckin' shit off!

01:21:13.135 --> 01:21:17.604
Don't you dare turn around!

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:20.107
Am I a suspect?

01:21:23.745 --> 01:21:26.646
Answer me, for Christ's sake.

01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:29.249
Well, sir. I'm not
gonna bullshit you.

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:30.784
You've been straight with us,

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:32.386
I'm gonna be straight with you.

01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:34.454
Everybody's a suspect.
But, you know-

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:38.592
ha ha ha! I'm a
suspect! Ha ha ha ha!

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:40.627
That's good news to me.

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:42.262
I'll drink to that even.

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:46.066
Hey, hey!
That's great.

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:51.104
Then by the time I got around the alley..

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:53.407
She was gone.

01:21:53.442 --> 01:21:57.044
Her headphones were on the ground.

01:21:57.079 --> 01:21:58.779
This is really strange, but I'm getting

01:21:58.814 --> 01:22:01.348
breathing, which means she's still alive.

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:03.316
I'm really getting that strong.

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:05.152
She's very frightened.

01:22:05.187 --> 01:22:07.487
She's very frightened, she's shaking..

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:09.823
A little bit, and, you know,

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:12.359
holding on for dear life pretty well.

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:14.795
Somehow I think that you're gonna find her.

01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:17.631
I feel like she's alive still.

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:20.167
Can you give me an indication

01:22:20.202 --> 01:22:24.171
or a sense of a location?

01:22:24.206 --> 01:22:26.406
Could she-could she
be in the vicinity

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:28.675
of where we are right now?

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:37.250
She's in a very dark place,

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:38.718
I can't see through her eyes.

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:40.587
What do you mean "dark"?

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:42.789
It's scary, I can't see any more.

01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:45.225
It's so scary and, you know,

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:47.327
I can't see 'cause it's dark around her.

01:22:47.362 --> 01:22:48.528
Thank you.

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:50.130
Thank you very much.

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:52.632
Thank you very much.
I hope you find her.

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:56.269
I want you to get back to your lovely lunch.

01:22:56.304 --> 01:22:58.505
It smells absolutely spectacular.

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.807
And get back to your beautiful music.

01:23:00.842 --> 01:23:02.342
What was that, "la forza del destino"

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:03.777
by verdi I heard?

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:06.379
- Yes, it was. Boy,
you like music.

01:23:06.414 --> 01:23:07.848
-I love music.

01:23:07.883 --> 01:23:10.851
Music is the companion of the soul.

01:23:10.886 --> 01:23:16.690
My favorite piece is madame butterfly

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:19.860
with jan peerce and albanese.

01:23:19.895 --> 01:23:23.396
Beautiful tenor, beautiful soprano.

01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:27.434
That recording.. I mean,
it's all scratched up

01:23:27.469 --> 01:23:30.203
I played it so many fucking times.

01:23:30.238 --> 01:23:32.239
Yeah, I love music too.

01:23:32.274 --> 01:23:34.407
Sir, if you can think of anything to help the

01:23:34.442 --> 01:23:36.343
little girl, which, I know you want to..

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:37.644
Here's my card.

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:40.247
My number's there and I would greatly

01:23:40.282 --> 01:23:43.316
appreciate it if you think of anything.

01:23:43.351 --> 01:23:46.586
You mind if I call you "Alfonso"?

01:23:46.621 --> 01:23:49.289
Not at all, sir. My
dad called me Alfonso.

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:50.690
-Pleasure.

01:23:50.725 --> 01:23:51.858
Pleasure's mine, sir.

01:23:51.893 --> 01:23:53.827
I really appreciate the time you gave us

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:56.196
and we apologize for
barging in on your lunch.

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:57.831
I don't dislike you that much either.

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:59.166
Ha ha!

01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:01.501
Thank you, sir.
We'll see ourselves out.

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:03.336
And do me a favor..
Lock that door.

01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:04.571
Lock the door, sir.

01:24:04.606 --> 01:24:06.206
Too late for that.

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:07.774
- Nice to meet
you, Mr. Florence.

01:24:07.809 --> 01:24:09.843
Nice meeting you.

01:24:11.947 --> 01:24:14.781
Some friends of mine are
friends with the sheriff

01:24:14.816 --> 01:24:16.816
in niagara falls, New York.

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:18.919
Apparently he told my friend that the

01:24:18.954 --> 01:24:21.855
ambassador is a scumbag
and the ambassador got

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:25.825
arrested at the casino for making some

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:31.498
inappropriate remarks and
inappropriate advances.

01:24:31.533 --> 01:24:34.334
And then they dropped the charges

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:35.735
because something happened.

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:37.337
What do you mean,

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:39.806
"they dropped the charges,
something happened"?

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:41.841
They dropped the
charges. Mysteriously

01:24:41.876 --> 01:24:43.810
everything went, so that means our friend,

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:46.279
Mr. ambassador,
has got some very

01:24:46.314 --> 01:24:48.481
serious, serious friends,
you know what I'm saying?

01:24:48.516 --> 01:24:49.583
Yup.

01:25:10.005 --> 01:25:11.371
Excuse me.

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:12.973
Yeah, can I help you gentlemen?

01:25:13.008 --> 01:25:15.508
My name is detective alfonse palermo

01:25:15.543 --> 01:25:17.410
from secret service Canada.

01:25:17.445 --> 01:25:18.612
This is my partner.

01:25:18.647 --> 01:25:20.247
Robert Santos.

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:22.216
We have a meeting with sheriff Williams.

01:25:26.888 --> 01:25:28.655
Sheriff Williams,

01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:31.024
there's a couple of guys here to see you.

01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:34.895
Okay, thanks.
He'll be right out.

01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:43.637
Thank you for seeing us, sheriff Williams.

01:25:43.672 --> 01:25:46.806
My name is special agent alfonse palermo,

01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:48.341
this is my partner.

01:25:48.376 --> 01:25:49.576
Robert Santos.

01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:51.011
Samuel told me you guys wanted to ask me

01:25:51.046 --> 01:25:52.746
some questions or something?

01:25:52.781 --> 01:25:54.881
For the ambassador of the
United States to Canada.

01:25:54.916 --> 01:25:56.683
Okay, come on in.

01:25:56.718 --> 01:25:58.585
Thank you, appreciate it.

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:01.855
Come on, have a seat, guys.

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:03.924
Thank you, sir.

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:11.331
Sheriff Williams, thank you for seeing us.

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:13.733
Samuel is a very, very dear friend of mine.

01:26:13.768 --> 01:26:15.635
In fact, he helped me
through a very tough time

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:18.371
and he says nothing but
great things about you.

01:26:18.406 --> 01:26:19.572
Good.

01:26:19.607 --> 01:26:20.974
He's a good friend of yours, right?

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:22.342
-Yes, he is.

01:26:22.377 --> 01:26:23.877
In Canada right now we're investigating

01:26:23.912 --> 01:26:25.645
the abduction or the disappearance

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.914
- we really have no
clue which one it is -

01:26:27.949 --> 01:26:32.719
of the very young daughter
of ambassador Adams

01:26:32.754 --> 01:26:37.991
and Samuel said there's
some connection with you.

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:41.728
I got a call from the casino that there was a

01:26:41.763 --> 01:26:48.335
guy down there that was
drunk, loud, obnoxious,

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:51.671
sexually harassing a young girl

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:53.407
at the Blackjack table.

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:31.878
And then what happened, sir?

01:27:31.913 --> 01:27:33.947
Well, I went down there myself.

01:27:33.982 --> 01:27:35.715
You went there personally?

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.751
- Yes, sir, and we arrested him.

01:27:37.786 --> 01:27:40.820
Took him back here and
put him in a holding cell.

01:27:40.855 --> 01:27:43.123
No sooner did I put him in the cell

01:27:43.158 --> 01:27:46.626
I got a phone call asking me to release him.

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:48.027
Who told you to release him?

01:27:48.062 --> 01:27:49.562
I'd rather not say.

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:51.698
But I told him to fuck off,

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:53.466
I wasn't gonna do it.

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:54.667
Good for you.

01:27:54.702 --> 01:27:57.404
And 30 seconds later..

01:27:57.439 --> 01:28:01.141
Maybe a minute at the
most, I got another phone

01:28:01.176 --> 01:28:04.043
call from someone at the top of the mountain

01:28:04.078 --> 01:28:07.781
telling me to release him and I released him.

01:28:07.816 --> 01:28:08.782
Why?

01:28:08.817 --> 01:28:12.452
Because I didn't want to be under

01:28:12.487 --> 01:28:15.088
the fucking mountain, that's why.

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:18.792
Sheriff Williams, may I ask you a question?

01:28:18.827 --> 01:28:20.760
Yeah.

01:28:20.795 --> 01:28:23.463
You really hate ambassador Adams,

01:28:23.498 --> 01:28:24.898
don't you?

01:28:24.933 --> 01:28:26.800
Fuckin' right I do.

01:28:26.835 --> 01:28:28.535
I think he's a piece of shit.

01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:30.437
I hate that motherfucker.

01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:32.539
He deserves to be put away.

01:28:34.742 --> 01:28:35.942
Hey, wait a minute.

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:38.711
Are you thinking I'm a suspect here?

01:28:38.746 --> 01:28:40.914
Are you serious, you two?

01:28:40.949 --> 01:28:42.649
You know what?

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:44.884
Get the fuck out of my office, you guys.

01:28:44.919 --> 01:28:47.720
Come on, get the fuck out now!

01:28:47.755 --> 01:28:49.456
Sheriff, thank you for your time.

01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:51.124
Fuck you, get out!

01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:55.729
Canadians.

01:29:02.971 --> 01:29:05.205
What do you got?

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:07.040
- You have to go change,

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:09.008
this is a sterile environment.

01:29:09.043 --> 01:29:10.243
I'm not gonna change.

01:29:10.278 --> 01:29:11.778
You look like a fucking ant.

01:29:11.813 --> 01:29:13.213
Tell me what you got, hurry up.

01:29:13.248 --> 01:29:14.614
-Okay.

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:16.649
This is from the alley.

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:17.784
-Okay.

01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:21.020
This is from the bar.

01:29:21.055 --> 01:29:22.755
-Okay.

01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:24.791
Alley.. Bar.

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:26.893
They did a DNA of plastic,

01:29:26.928 --> 01:29:28.995
these are exactly
the same. Identical.

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:32.031
That can only
belong to that? How?

01:29:32.066 --> 01:29:33.600
Okay, same Gauge.

01:29:33.635 --> 01:29:35.034
-Okay, so?

01:29:35.069 --> 01:29:38.037
Same resin, the cure is exactly the same.

01:29:38.072 --> 01:29:40.507
These come from exactly the same roll.

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:41.708
100% guaranteed?

01:29:41.743 --> 01:29:44.143
Yeah, from the same roll.

01:29:44.178 --> 01:29:48.014
So the person that was
in the bar was stalking

01:29:48.049 --> 01:29:50.750
the laneway and that was stuck in their foot.

01:29:50.785 --> 01:29:53.686
If there's grooves on the bottom, like tread,

01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:55.688
this would stick to it

01:29:55.723 --> 01:29:57.156
from wherever they were walking.

01:29:57.191 --> 01:29:58.291
-Exactly.

01:29:58.326 --> 01:29:59.826
It's unbelievable.

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:16.776
What a day.

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:21.114
I'll be back in a minute.

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:25.018
Gonna get al, see if he wants to join us.

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:29.923
Al?

01:30:29.958 --> 01:30:32.292
Where were you? We've
been waiting here all night.

01:30:32.327 --> 01:30:35.194
Look, these bordoons are here.

01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:36.729
I'm with my wife, Janet.

01:30:36.764 --> 01:30:39.799
Come sit down, come say hello.

01:30:44.205 --> 01:30:45.305
Who's that?

01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:47.040
-Amy.

01:30:47.075 --> 01:30:50.343
Al, she's a friend.

01:30:50.378 --> 01:30:51.911
I'm married, okay?

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:54.013
Al, it's been two
years. Sit down.

01:30:54.048 --> 01:30:55.248
I'm married.

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:56.716
Al, two years.

01:30:56.751 --> 01:30:59.719
Who are you...
I'm married.

01:30:59.754 --> 01:31:02.255
Right here, still.
See that?

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:04.124
Mind your own fuckin' business.

01:31:12.333 --> 01:31:14.767
How are you doing, al?

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:16.069
-I'm doing good.

01:31:16.104 --> 01:31:17.236
Really?

01:31:17.271 --> 01:31:18.304
-Yeah.

01:31:18.339 --> 01:31:19.973
Calm down, hm?

01:31:20.008 --> 01:31:22.075
- Calm down? What are
you, a psychiatrist?

01:31:22.110 --> 01:31:24.143
Why don't you mind your own business.

01:31:24.178 --> 01:31:28.781
Go back with your, uh, bordoonies there

01:31:28.816 --> 01:31:30.116
and finish your drink.

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:32.018
Come on, cool it, al.

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:38.625
Jesus Christ.

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:39.792
-Good evening.

01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:41.695
Stop playing this shit.

01:31:44.966 --> 01:31:47.900
This bar, ladies and gentlemen,

01:31:47.935 --> 01:31:53.906
is very special to me 'cause my wife..

01:31:53.941 --> 01:31:56.342
My wife loved coming here.

01:31:56.377 --> 01:31:59.245
That was the
last time.. Um..

01:32:06.154 --> 01:32:09.155
She lied to me.

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:12.892
She said she was gonna stay with me..

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:16.429
That she was gonna be with me forever..

01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:20.266
Hm.. Forever.

01:32:20.301 --> 01:32:24.270
She betrayed me.
She went and died.

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:31.344
The last time I saw her alive was here,

01:32:31.379 --> 01:32:34.681
celebrating my, uh..

01:32:34.716 --> 01:32:35.848
My daughter's graduation.

01:32:35.883 --> 01:32:37.150
She's still here, my wife.

01:32:37.185 --> 01:32:39.318
She's looking at me.
I know you can't see her

01:32:39.353 --> 01:32:41.187
but maybe I'm going crazy.

01:32:46.027 --> 01:32:47.827
You ruined my life.

01:32:47.862 --> 01:32:51.130
You used to say "don't live with

01:32:51.165 --> 01:32:53.066
somebody you can live with.

01:32:53.101 --> 01:32:55.835
Live with somebody you can't live without".

01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:57.103
Al, buddy.

01:32:57.138 --> 01:32:58.938
You ruined my life!

01:32:58.973 --> 01:33:00.006
Al..

01:33:07.148 --> 01:33:08.248
Fuck off!

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.291
Gentlemen..

01:33:18.326 --> 01:33:20.860
I'll just put this down for you here.

01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:23.229
Listen, I want to thank you.

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:25.264
I've made more money here than I did

01:33:25.299 --> 01:33:26.866
in a year at that old place.

01:33:26.901 --> 01:33:27.900
No problem.

01:33:27.935 --> 01:33:30.236
Just keep 'em coming tonight.

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:32.505
Listen, al, that's your fourth shot.

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:35.508
Maggie, I like you.
Let's keep it that way.

01:33:35.543 --> 01:33:37.410
Just keep 'em coming.

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:39.812
I'll just keep 'em coming.

01:33:39.847 --> 01:33:42.215
That girl wants to bang you.

01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:44.417
Why do you have to be disrespectful?

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:46.753
If you don't want to bang her, I'll bang her.

01:33:46.788 --> 01:33:48.521
You want to bang everybody.

01:33:48.556 --> 01:33:51.924
You alright, al?

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:55.027
Sorry. Sorry
about before.

01:33:55.062 --> 01:33:59.398
I'm just a little stressed out.

01:33:59.433 --> 01:34:02.401
I know the feeling.

01:34:02.436 --> 01:34:04.837
Where's the senator?

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:06.906
Oh, he stepped in.

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:11.778
Maggie? I want to
buy another round

01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:13.446
for my friends over here, okay?

01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:14.814
-Absolutely.

01:34:14.849 --> 01:34:16.082
Celebrating bullshit.

01:34:16.117 --> 01:34:17.416
Celebrating stress.

01:34:17.451 --> 01:34:19.285
Celebrating dysfunctionality.

01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:25.525
Your scotch is coming up.

01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:39.305
Hey, baby. Let me
buy you a drink.

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:41.040
-Sorry.

01:34:41.075 --> 01:34:43.109
Can I have a sparkling water?

01:34:43.144 --> 01:34:44.877
Come on, what's wrong?

01:34:44.912 --> 01:34:46.546
I'm here alone, you're here alone..

01:34:46.581 --> 01:34:47.980
- I'm not here alone.

01:34:48.015 --> 01:34:49.448
What do you mean, you're not here alone?

01:34:49.483 --> 01:34:50.950
I'm not, okay?

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:53.253
Come on.
Just one drink.

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:06.399
Al?

01:35:06.434 --> 01:35:09.001
She's your friend.

01:35:09.036 --> 01:35:12.338
We're eating
peanuts. Go.

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:14.207
Come on, Hercules.

01:35:14.242 --> 01:35:16.576
Yeah.

01:35:16.611 --> 01:35:18.211
Amy, you okay?

01:35:18.246 --> 01:35:19.612
-No.

01:35:19.647 --> 01:35:21.347
Go see Janet. She
wants to talk to you.

01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:22.215
-Alright.

01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:27.920
What are you doing?

01:35:27.955 --> 01:35:29.322
What do you mean, what am I doing?

01:35:29.357 --> 01:35:30.556
Why are you bothering her?

01:35:30.591 --> 01:35:32.892
Who said I'm bothering her?

01:35:32.927 --> 01:35:35.094
I saw you bothering her.

01:35:35.129 --> 01:35:36.896
Why are you bothering her?

01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:38.331
Shut up, little
man, before I-

01:35:38.366 --> 01:35:40.066
wait a minute.

01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:43.102
I'm not a little man.
Secret service Canada.

01:35:43.137 --> 01:35:46.439
Ha! Fuck the secret
service can-ahh!

01:35:46.474 --> 01:35:49.575
It's okay, it's
okay. Relax.

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:52.245
Glass of water.

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:55.047
It's okay.

01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:58.084
Now drink the glass of water

01:35:58.119 --> 01:36:00.019
and get the fuck outta here.

01:36:00.054 --> 01:36:01.621
You're taking all the oxygen

01:36:01.656 --> 01:36:03.389
from the rest of us, you understand me?

01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:04.924
Yes, sir.

01:36:04.959 --> 01:36:06.993
Alright, get the fuck outta here.

01:36:12.366 --> 01:36:13.399
Thank you.

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:14.967
Did you need our help?

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:17.036
I'm surprised he's still walking.

01:36:20.141 --> 01:36:22.141
I'm gonna get another round for everybody.

01:36:22.176 --> 01:36:23.342
-No, no.

01:36:23.377 --> 01:36:25.645
Aw, guys,
guys.. Relax.

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.413
Okay, you fucking wimps.

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:29.081
I want a drink.

01:36:29.116 --> 01:36:30.616
Give me a double, a double scotch.

01:36:30.651 --> 01:36:33.252
I can't, you've had enough.

01:36:33.287 --> 01:36:35.154
I got you this job here,

01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:36.689
you're gonna betray me like that?

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:38.491
If I get you another drink

01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:40.159
I'm gonna get fired.

01:36:40.194 --> 01:36:42.028
And because I don't want to betray you

01:36:42.063 --> 01:36:44.130
is why I'm not getting you a drink.

01:36:44.165 --> 01:36:47.099
Al.. I've known you
for a long time.

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:49.168
I can't serve you anymore.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.307
Fuck you.

01:36:54.342 --> 01:36:56.009
-Thanks, al.

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:01.247
-I'm out.

01:37:01.282 --> 01:37:03.115
Fuck you.

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:04.617
-Put him out.

01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:13.492
Been coming here for 25 fucking years

01:37:13.527 --> 01:37:16.362
and they cut me off?
Prick bastards.

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:21.534
I want my keys, man.

01:37:21.569 --> 01:37:23.402
I'm not leaving my car here.

01:37:23.437 --> 01:37:25.104
Give me my fucking keys.

01:37:25.139 --> 01:37:26.572
And you're not driving it.

01:37:26.607 --> 01:37:28.040
You're a shitty driver.

01:37:28.075 --> 01:37:29.575
I don't have your keys.

01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:31.377
You got my keys.
I saw you-

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:33.012
no, no.
Come on.

01:37:33.047 --> 01:37:34.413
I am not drunk.

01:37:34.448 --> 01:37:36.549
If I was drunk-i
know myself, okay?

01:37:36.584 --> 01:37:38.517
And I didn't even drink that fuckin' much.

01:37:38.552 --> 01:37:41.087
He had a good time is all.

01:37:41.122 --> 01:37:43.089
I'm not gonna give you
your keys, you know that.

01:37:43.124 --> 01:37:44.690
Don't make me beat the shit out of you.

01:37:44.725 --> 01:37:46.158
Just give me my fuckin' keys.

01:37:46.193 --> 01:37:47.626
If after 25 years you want to beat the

01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:49.495
fuckin' shit out of me, go ahead.

01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:51.364
I'm not giving you your keys, understand?

01:37:51.399 --> 01:37:52.732
You called my dad?

01:37:52.767 --> 01:37:55.067
Hey, listen to me, okay?

01:37:55.102 --> 01:37:58.437
You're not the only person

01:37:58.472 --> 01:38:00.172
who lost something, alright?

01:38:00.207 --> 01:38:01.540
I lost your mother too.

01:38:01.575 --> 01:38:03.042
I just want my keys, dad.

01:38:03.077 --> 01:38:05.177
You got no fuckin'
keys. No keys.

01:38:05.212 --> 01:38:07.346
You're gonna go home
with me. Understand?

01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:08.447
You're gonna grow up.

01:38:08.482 --> 01:38:10.016
Grow up!

01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:12.485
We all lose people.
You understand me?

01:38:14.755 --> 01:38:16.122
Okay?

01:38:16.157 --> 01:38:17.991
Let's go home.
Come on.

01:38:25.499 --> 01:38:27.333
Let's get the hell outta here.

01:38:37.645 --> 01:38:41.647
Oh, al..
Sweetheart.

01:38:41.682 --> 01:38:44.483
You're breaking my heart.

01:38:44.518 --> 01:38:46.619
Why are you doing this to yourself?

01:38:46.654 --> 01:38:48.354
Why are you doing this to me?

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:49.688
You're dead.

01:38:49.723 --> 01:38:51.724
You're dead. Can't
you stay dead?

01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:58.130
If I stay dead, you won't live.

01:38:58.165 --> 01:39:01.467
As soon as you start living I'll leave.

01:39:01.502 --> 01:39:04.737
But you have to choose to live, al.

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:09.241
You can't kill yourself.

01:39:09.276 --> 01:39:12.711
You killed me the day you died.

01:39:12.746 --> 01:39:14.814
I love you.

01:39:20.454 --> 01:39:22.354
Director.

01:39:22.389 --> 01:39:27.226
Why am I here?

01:39:27.261 --> 01:39:31.630
Joseph..

01:39:31.665 --> 01:39:33.666
Yeah?

01:39:33.701 --> 01:39:35.367
I've been a fan of yours for a long time.

01:39:35.402 --> 01:39:36.368
That's nice.

01:39:36.403 --> 01:39:37.703
Hear me out.

01:39:37.738 --> 01:39:41.140
I got this position 'cause of you.

01:39:41.175 --> 01:39:43.676
I don't have all fucking night, come on.

01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:48.414
Look, with all due respect, I need to

01:39:48.449 --> 01:39:50.616
tell you some things about your son.

01:39:50.651 --> 01:39:52.685
About my son?

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:53.886
-Yes.

01:39:53.921 --> 01:39:55.588
What about my son?

01:39:55.623 --> 01:39:57.490
Joseph, he's a special agent.

01:39:57.525 --> 01:40:01.560
He comes in
drunk.. Disheveled.

01:40:01.595 --> 01:40:04.430
He doesn't shave.
He doesn't care.

01:40:04.465 --> 01:40:05.898
He's a renegade.

01:40:05.933 --> 01:40:08.300
He doesn't listen to anything that I say.

01:40:08.335 --> 01:40:10.402
Do you hear me?

01:40:10.437 --> 01:40:12.538
Let me tell you something, okay?

01:40:12.573 --> 01:40:15.674
I put you here.

01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:18.878
I worked for four prime ministers!

01:40:18.913 --> 01:40:20.746
I was trudeau's man.

01:40:20.781 --> 01:40:24.216
My son.. Drunk, sober,
or whatever the fuck,

01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:26.285
is the best you've ever had!

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.787
Don't give me any bullshit about my son!

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:30.923
Don't tell me anything about upstairs!

01:40:30.958 --> 01:40:34.593
You just take care of it
and take care of my son!

01:40:34.628 --> 01:40:37.563
You understand me?

01:40:37.598 --> 01:40:39.632
Yes, I do.

01:40:39.667 --> 01:40:43.169
I don't want to come here again!

01:40:43.204 --> 01:40:48.875
I'm sorry...
Sorry, Joseph.

01:40:58.452 --> 01:40:59.485
Fuck.

01:41:07.328 --> 01:41:10.462
Where is he?
Where is he?!

01:41:10.497 --> 01:41:11.597
-He's in there.

01:41:11.632 --> 01:41:13.499
Six frickin' hours.

01:41:17.338 --> 01:41:19.471
You got a key? Give
me the fucking key!

01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:20.873
Open the door.

01:41:20.908 --> 01:41:22.375
I'll wait out here.

01:41:26.513 --> 01:41:28.547
You.. You
piece of shit!

01:41:28.582 --> 01:41:31.383
Listen, you fuckin' piece of shit!

01:41:31.418 --> 01:41:33.886
What are you doing, you prick?

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:35.554
You're supposed to be looking for my

01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:39.358
granddaughter, you dirty,
lowlife, scumbag, you!

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:41.460
My granddaughter I trusted you with!

01:41:41.495 --> 01:41:43.696
I bet on you.

01:41:43.731 --> 01:41:46.832
I bet everything I had on you.

01:41:46.867 --> 01:41:48.467
I'm gonna kill you,

01:41:48.502 --> 01:41:50.302
I swear to god I'm gonna kill you.

01:41:50.337 --> 01:41:53.405
- Do it. Do me a
fuckin' favor,

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:55.341
put me out of my fuckin' misery.

01:41:55.376 --> 01:41:58.777
Do it. I'm tired of
this, do it. Please.

01:42:01.582 --> 01:42:03.515
Alright, alright.

01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:07.019
Okay, shh.

01:42:13.294 --> 01:42:15.661
I'm so fucking tired.

01:42:15.696 --> 01:42:20.633
- Okay, we'll fix it, okay?

01:42:20.668 --> 01:42:23.702
We'll fix it.

01:42:23.737 --> 01:42:26.405
You and my granddaughter.

01:42:32.413 --> 01:42:34.380
Come in,
Mr. palermo.

01:42:34.415 --> 01:42:37.250
Sit down over there if you would, please?

01:42:41.922 --> 01:42:44.824
Odd way to meet you, Alfonso.

01:42:51.332 --> 01:42:53.499
You're not gonna make this easy, are you?

01:42:53.534 --> 01:42:55.434
Please. I promised
I would come here.

01:42:55.469 --> 01:42:59.338
Tell me what you gotta tell me, please.

01:42:59.373 --> 01:43:01.373
First of all, what do
you want me to call you?

01:43:01.408 --> 01:43:02.875
Alfonso? Al?

01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:04.610
Al's fine.

01:43:04.645 --> 01:43:06.845
-Al's fine, okay.

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:09.415
Well, my name is
Dr. Amanda Walker

01:43:09.450 --> 01:43:11.517
and I'd like you to
call me Dr. Walker.

01:43:11.552 --> 01:43:13.452
How's that?

01:43:13.487 --> 01:43:14.353
That's fine.

01:43:14.388 --> 01:43:15.754
-Okay, good.

01:43:15.789 --> 01:43:20.592
Now before we continue,
I want you to -

01:43:20.627 --> 01:43:23.028
boy, you have a complicated history here.

01:43:23.063 --> 01:43:26.832
Let me just start with this notion that

01:43:26.867 --> 01:43:32.938
you could let go of, or have closure with

01:43:32.973 --> 01:43:35.908
the fact you've been through this trauma,

01:43:35.943 --> 01:43:39.812
that you have lost your
wife and your whole family

01:43:39.847 --> 01:43:42.448
in one shot, is nonsense.

01:43:45.152 --> 01:43:48.620
Why do we have to talk about that right now?

01:43:48.655 --> 01:43:50.389
I have a case.

01:43:50.424 --> 01:43:52.925
The senator wants me to
find his granddaughter.

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:54.693
I shouldn't be here talking to you

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:56.595
trying to be psychoanalyzed.

01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:58.397
I can see pain coming out of

01:43:58.432 --> 01:44:00.399
every single one of your pores.

01:44:00.434 --> 01:44:02.601
Every cell in your being is screaming pain,

01:44:02.636 --> 01:44:04.403
and if you don't look at it..

01:44:04.438 --> 01:44:07.473
You can't be helped.
It won't go away.

01:44:07.508 --> 01:44:09.975
I know you have a job
now where you're needed.

01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:12.544
I understand you're very complicated.

01:44:12.579 --> 01:44:14.980
I understand you're really, really good

01:44:15.015 --> 01:44:18.050
at what you do..
But I can't help you

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:20.119
if you don't want to be helped.

01:44:20.154 --> 01:44:21.720
I really can't.

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:23.589
So ask me your questions.

01:44:23.624 --> 01:44:25.591
Let's get this dance going.

01:44:25.626 --> 01:44:26.925
Do what you gotta do.

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:30.062
It's not quite that simple.

01:44:30.097 --> 01:44:32.664
First of all, I have to
ask you a very awkward

01:44:32.699 --> 01:44:34.867
question and I'm going to
tell you ahead of time,

01:44:34.902 --> 01:44:36.835
if you answer "yes" I have to call

01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:38.637
the authorities and tell them.

01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:40.572
So let's cover that ground right now.

01:44:40.607 --> 01:44:44.143
If in fact you want to die,

01:44:44.178 --> 01:44:48.881
you have to know that if you tell me that

01:44:48.916 --> 01:44:50.983
- I want you to
really hear me -

01:44:51.018 --> 01:44:52.751
I have to call the police.

01:44:52.786 --> 01:44:54.820
I walk around with a loaded 9 mm beretta

01:44:54.855 --> 01:44:56.522
every day. If
I wanted to

01:44:56.557 --> 01:44:58.056
put it in my fuckin' mouth and end it

01:44:58.091 --> 01:44:59.858
I would do it.

01:44:59.893 --> 01:45:02.027
So can you stop trying to psychoanalyze me?

01:45:02.062 --> 01:45:03.996
I'm not trying to psychoanalyze you.

01:45:04.031 --> 01:45:05.831
I'm trying to help you.

01:45:05.866 --> 01:45:08.967
I'm trying to get you to
take all that pain and

01:45:09.002 --> 01:45:11.603
not "get over it", that's just nonsensical.

01:45:11.638 --> 01:45:15.040
Who could get over losing your daughter

01:45:15.075 --> 01:45:16.775
and your wife?

01:45:16.810 --> 01:45:18.710
How do I get over that?

01:45:18.745 --> 01:45:21.146
You don't get over that,
but what you can do is

01:45:21.181 --> 01:45:23.615
you can learn to take
all that pain and put it

01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:26.151
in some part of yourself that separates it

01:45:26.186 --> 01:45:28.053
from the other things
you're feeling so you can

01:45:28.088 --> 01:45:31.089
function without that bottle of scotch a day

01:45:31.124 --> 01:45:35.127
without cutting it off,
that you can function.

01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:37.496
We're trying to get you
better so you don't hurt

01:45:37.531 --> 01:45:40.899
as much. And it's
possible because..

01:45:40.934 --> 01:45:44.636
I've been there. I
have been there.

01:45:44.671 --> 01:45:46.071
You lost your family in one night?

01:45:46.106 --> 01:45:47.906
In one second, in one flash?

01:45:47.941 --> 01:45:49.675
In one moment your whole destiny

01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:51.043
goes down the fucking drain,

01:45:51.078 --> 01:45:53.645
all your aspirations, all you ever lived for?

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:55.747
Everything you hoped for are gone?

01:45:55.782 --> 01:45:57.082
You've done that?

01:45:57.117 --> 01:45:59.251
I've lost a lot, let's leave it at that.

01:45:59.286 --> 01:46:00.886
We're not here to talk about me,

01:46:00.921 --> 01:46:04.490
but the pain you must be feeling

01:46:04.525 --> 01:46:08.126
is something that a few
of us have been through

01:46:08.161 --> 01:46:11.630
and it is enormous and it never leaves.

01:46:11.665 --> 01:46:13.799
But you have to learn to cope with it

01:46:13.834 --> 01:46:15.968
better than you're doing.

01:46:16.003 --> 01:46:19.271
I mean, look at you.
Just look at you.

01:46:19.306 --> 01:46:26.545
You could use
a shower. No?

01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:28.647
Oh, Alfonso.

01:46:34.121 --> 01:46:37.556
I think for today we've
covered enough ground.

01:46:37.591 --> 01:46:39.925
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what -

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:43.262
can we make a deal?
Here's the deal.

01:46:43.297 --> 01:46:49.701
Can you try coming back
one more time and, before

01:46:49.736 --> 01:46:53.672
you come, instead of seeing me as the enemy,

01:46:53.707 --> 01:46:56.808
open up your heart a little bit and go

01:46:56.843 --> 01:46:58.810
"she's a fellow human being,

01:46:58.845 --> 01:47:00.746
she's been through a lot.

01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:03.115
Maybe we can help each other".

01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:04.650
-Okay.

01:47:04.685 --> 01:47:06.285
Can you do that?

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:08.787
I can't promise you, but I'll do my best.

01:47:08.822 --> 01:47:10.789
It's nice meeting
you, Dr. Walker.

01:47:10.824 --> 01:47:12.658
Thank you for your time.

01:47:16.730 --> 01:47:18.664
Ohhh.

01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:05.611
Hello, who is this?

01:48:05.646 --> 01:48:07.913
<i>Hello, it's Bernard.</i>

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:09.815
Bernard?

01:48:09.850 --> 01:48:11.149
<i>Bernard Florence.</i>

01:48:11.184 --> 01:48:12.818
Mr. Florence,
how are you?

01:48:12.853 --> 01:48:14.853
Call me Bernie, uh?

01:48:14.888 --> 01:48:16.355
Bernie.

01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:17.856
<i>I'm okay.</i>

01:48:17.891 --> 01:48:21.893
I came across your card
and I've been thinking

01:48:21.928 --> 01:48:26.799
a lot and I have a confession to make.

01:48:29.403 --> 01:48:31.870
You've got a confession to make?

01:48:31.905 --> 01:48:34.306
Yeah, something's been bothering me.

01:48:34.341 --> 01:48:37.776
I haven't been totally
honest with you and it's

01:48:37.811 --> 01:48:41.680
been driving me a little
crazy, I gotta tell you.

01:48:41.715 --> 01:48:45.183
I came across your card just now and..

01:48:45.218 --> 01:48:51.156
Anyway, do you mind if I tell you something?

01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:53.925
Go ahead.
I'm all ears.

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:56.094
I've been driving that son of a bitch

01:48:56.129 --> 01:49:00.265
for a lot of years and one thing happened

01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:03.301
that drove me a little crazy.

01:49:03.336 --> 01:49:07.906
The more I think about it
the more I feel it can be

01:49:07.941 --> 01:49:10.409
of help to you, if you know what I'm saying.

01:49:10.444 --> 01:49:13.779
I mean, I was in the front seat many times

01:49:13.814 --> 01:49:16.014
when he had different
people in the back seat,

01:49:16.049 --> 01:49:18.050
you know, and I played like

01:49:18.085 --> 01:49:19.785
I didn't hear what was going on

01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:22.054
but I knew what was going on all the time.

01:49:22.089 --> 01:49:25.323
And there was one time, one particular time

01:49:25.358 --> 01:49:29.895
when his assistant, Marie,

01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:33.198
she was like his private colluder.

01:49:33.233 --> 01:49:36.034
So, ambassador, I rearranged your schedule.

01:49:36.069 --> 01:49:39.438
I've now got the ministry of transportation

01:49:39.473 --> 01:49:42.908
meeting for you at
3:00 instead of 4:00.

01:49:42.943 --> 01:49:44.777
Would that work for you, sir?

01:49:49.416 --> 01:49:51.884
You know, I can't hear you.

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:01.093
So as I was saying..

01:50:01.128 --> 01:50:03.228
The minister of transportation,

01:50:03.263 --> 01:50:04.463
he can meet
you at-

01:50:04.498 --> 01:50:06.264
can you do me a favor?

01:50:06.299 --> 01:50:08.033
-Sure.

01:50:39.332 --> 01:50:42.167
Don't be silly.
I got a meeting.

01:50:44.971 --> 01:50:47.239
Honey, I love you so much.

01:50:47.274 --> 01:50:49.407
You know I want to be with you.

01:50:49.442 --> 01:50:51.777
I would do anything for you.

01:50:51.812 --> 01:50:55.147
Don't be foolish.
I've got a daughter.

01:50:55.182 --> 01:50:57.883
I have a family.

01:50:57.918 --> 01:50:59.184
If I didn't have a daughter

01:50:59.219 --> 01:51:01.419
maybe things would be different.

01:51:01.454 --> 01:51:04.322
She talked about leaving his wife

01:51:04.357 --> 01:51:06.892
and marrying her.

01:51:06.927 --> 01:51:08.426
So the reason he couldn't marry her

01:51:08.461 --> 01:51:11.129
was because he had a daughter?

01:51:11.164 --> 01:51:15.967
What I heard her say basically was "well,

01:51:16.002 --> 01:51:19.538
what if you didn't
have a daughter?"

01:51:19.573 --> 01:51:21.873
Bernie, indulge
me. Listen to me.

01:51:21.908 --> 01:51:23.909
I'm trying to understand
what you're telling me.

01:51:23.944 --> 01:51:26.178
You're telling me that he basically said

01:51:26.213 --> 01:51:29.014
if he didn't have a daughter, if he did not

01:51:29.049 --> 01:51:31.316
have a daughter getting in the way,

01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:33.852
he would leave his wife and marry this bitch?

01:51:33.887 --> 01:51:36.087
Is that what you're telling me?

01:51:36.122 --> 01:51:39.024
That's what he inferred, yeah.

01:51:39.059 --> 01:51:41.326
And it disturbed the hell outta me

01:51:41.361 --> 01:51:44.229
when I realized his daughter disappeared.

01:51:44.264 --> 01:51:52.404
If I suspected anybody..
Uh, it might be her.

01:51:52.439 --> 01:51:54.906
You know, Bernie.
You made my day,

01:51:54.941 --> 01:51:56.575
and if I was there I'd give you a kiss.

01:51:56.610 --> 01:51:58.176
You're a good man.

01:51:58.211 --> 01:52:00.212
Hey, I'm not saying she did it!

01:52:00.247 --> 01:52:02.414
Bernie, leave that to us.

01:52:02.449 --> 01:52:04.983
I want to give you this advice.

01:52:05.018 --> 01:52:06.985
Anytime you need me, you call me

01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:08.520
and maybe we'll go break some bread.

01:52:08.555 --> 01:52:10.021
Okay, Bernie?

01:52:10.056 --> 01:52:11.957
You're a good guy,
alfonse. Believe me.

01:52:11.992 --> 01:52:14.159
I don't like many cops but I like you.

01:52:14.194 --> 01:52:16.394
Bernie, god bless and you have a good day.

01:52:16.429 --> 01:52:17.896
Thank you.

01:52:17.931 --> 01:52:19.598
You too.
Bye-bye.

01:52:24.971 --> 01:52:26.438
Rob..

01:52:26.473 --> 01:52:31.343
Meet me at Marie MacDonald's place now.

01:52:39.552 --> 01:52:42.254
I just got a call from the driver.

01:52:42.289 --> 01:52:43.288
-Florence.

01:52:43.323 --> 01:52:45.056
Exactly.

01:52:45.091 --> 01:52:48.526
And I knew I liked that man right away.

01:52:48.561 --> 01:52:51.429
It's her...
It's her.

01:52:51.464 --> 01:52:54.599
I never liked the assistant.

01:52:54.634 --> 01:52:57.669
I don't like the ambassador, but it's her.

01:52:57.704 --> 01:53:00.405
What are you doing?

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.040
I'm liking your Cologne.

01:53:02.075 --> 01:53:03.575
What do you mean by that?

01:53:03.610 --> 01:53:05.176
It's better than the old one.

01:53:05.211 --> 01:53:06.344
What's the old one?

01:53:06.379 --> 01:53:07.880
Johnny Walker.

01:53:10.116 --> 01:53:11.583
You be fucking serious for now,

01:53:11.618 --> 01:53:13.184
and I'm gonna handle this.

01:53:13.219 --> 01:53:15.353
You lead, I'll follow, man.

01:53:15.388 --> 01:53:16.955
I've had enough of this shit.

01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:18.023
This is it.

01:53:33.273 --> 01:53:34.106
<i>Coming!</i>

01:53:41.348 --> 01:53:42.447
Gentlemen..

01:53:42.482 --> 01:53:43.615
Ms MacDonald.

01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:46.017
Sorry to come here at such an early hour

01:53:46.052 --> 01:53:48.119
but I need to talk
to you. It's urgent.

01:53:48.154 --> 01:53:49.487
You mind if we come in?

01:53:49.522 --> 01:53:51.089
-Sure, come on in.

01:53:51.124 --> 01:53:52.390
Ask you a few questions.

01:53:52.425 --> 01:53:54.293
-Come on in.

01:53:56.062 --> 01:53:58.130
Is the ambassador alright?

01:54:01.334 --> 01:54:05.337
Can you please
sit down? Please.

01:54:05.372 --> 01:54:07.238
-Sure.

01:54:07.273 --> 01:54:09.975
Sorry to intrude on you
like this, ms MacDonald,

01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:11.509
but.. Where are
you moving to?

01:54:11.544 --> 01:54:15.246
Oh, I'm moving to the ambassador's house.

01:54:15.281 --> 01:54:17.582
It's just to save costs.

01:54:17.617 --> 01:54:20.385
I'm sorry, why are you moving there?

01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:22.988
It's going to save us
money and I'll be closer

01:54:23.023 --> 01:54:25.056
because there's so much stuff going on

01:54:25.091 --> 01:54:26.257
during the day.

01:54:26.292 --> 01:54:27.492
-Uh huh.

01:54:27.527 --> 01:54:29.194
We have a very busy schedule so it's better

01:54:29.229 --> 01:54:32.731
if I'm closer to him.

01:54:32.766 --> 01:54:34.699
Uh huh.

01:54:34.734 --> 01:54:36.267
I want to ask you..

01:54:36.302 --> 01:54:38.269
On the morning of the abduction,

01:54:38.304 --> 01:54:39.637
where were you?

01:54:39.672 --> 01:54:41.239
Oh...

01:54:41.274 --> 01:54:43.041
By the way, forgive me for the mess here.

01:54:43.076 --> 01:54:44.609
I was packing,

01:54:44.644 --> 01:54:46.511
so that's why there's all the boxes.

01:54:46.546 --> 01:54:49.481
You told us before that you were moving.

01:54:49.516 --> 01:54:51.216
Yeah.

01:54:51.251 --> 01:54:53.218
Where were you on the
morning of the abduction?

01:54:53.253 --> 01:54:55.353
I was packing.

01:54:55.388 --> 01:54:58.656
Packing..
By yourself?

01:54:58.691 --> 01:55:00.492
Did you have movers here?

01:55:00.527 --> 01:55:04.796
No. You know what?
I do have an agenda

01:55:04.831 --> 01:55:07.198
and I do have the
name of the moving-

01:55:07.233 --> 01:55:09.501
I'm asking you a simple question, please.

01:55:09.536 --> 01:55:12.404
I'm tired.. Please.

01:55:14.107 --> 01:55:15.140
Sorry?

01:55:15.175 --> 01:55:16.808
I'm not patient right now.

01:55:16.843 --> 01:55:18.777
We're running out of time, so I'm gonna ask

01:55:18.812 --> 01:55:20.745
you questions and I want straight answers.

01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:22.514
- You understand?
- Of course.

01:55:22.549 --> 01:55:24.115
I don't want to be manipulated

01:55:24.150 --> 01:55:26.418
or jerked off. I
don't have time.

01:55:26.453 --> 01:55:29.521
So I'm not gonna use any decorum with you,

01:55:29.556 --> 01:55:31.589
I'm gonna be black and white.

01:55:31.624 --> 01:55:33.725
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:37.562
Can anybody vouch for you on the morning,

01:55:37.597 --> 01:55:40.165
Monday morning?
Can somebody

01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:42.567
physically fucking tell me that they saw you?

01:55:42.602 --> 01:55:44.602
You have <i>my</i> word.

01:55:44.637 --> 01:55:47.405
Your word means shit
to me. You understand?

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:49.574
Yes.

01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:54.145
Where were you - I'm
not gonna ask you again -

01:55:54.180 --> 01:55:57.115
where were you
between 7:00 and 8:30?

01:55:57.150 --> 01:56:00.085
Ah, I was in my living room and I was

01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:02.087
packing up - I remember
this very vividly -

01:56:02.122 --> 01:56:04.589
I was packing up this
couch with plastic-

01:56:04.624 --> 01:56:06.324
and who was here with you?

01:56:06.359 --> 01:56:07.592
-Nobody.

01:56:07.627 --> 01:56:09.761
So the short answer is..

01:56:09.796 --> 01:56:12.664
Nobody can vouch that they were with you

01:56:12.699 --> 01:56:14.532
during that timeline.

01:56:14.567 --> 01:56:16.167
Let me ask you another question.

01:56:16.202 --> 01:56:18.503
What's your relationship with the ambassador?

01:56:18.538 --> 01:56:20.638
Oh, I'm his personal assistant.

01:56:20.673 --> 01:56:22.373
I do everything for him.

01:56:22.408 --> 01:56:23.842
You ever fuck him?

01:56:23.877 --> 01:56:26.845
I don't have to answer that question.

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:28.880
No, you don't.
Have you given him

01:56:28.915 --> 01:56:31.216
blow jobs ever in the limousine?

01:56:31.251 --> 01:56:33.551
Ever blow him in the back seat of the limo?

01:56:33.586 --> 01:56:35.320
I don't have to answer that question.

01:56:35.355 --> 01:56:37.155
I'll tell you which question

01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:39.190
you have to answer.

01:56:39.225 --> 01:56:41.559
I want to know where the little girl is.

01:56:41.594 --> 01:56:47.132
Because right now I'm smelling kidnapping.

01:56:47.167 --> 01:56:52.570
After that it's kidnapping and murder.

01:56:52.605 --> 01:56:54.405
I don't know where she is.

01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:55.507
- You don't know where she is?

01:56:55.542 --> 01:56:56.708
No, I don't.

01:57:01.848 --> 01:57:03.882
You don't know where she is, eh?

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:15.860
Listen, I've never hit a woman

01:57:15.895 --> 01:57:17.762
in my entire life, ever.

01:57:17.797 --> 01:57:19.797
I don't like that shit, but..

01:57:19.832 --> 01:57:23.735
Look at me. You cunt.
I'm gonna ask you once.

01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:27.438
Where is that little girl?

01:57:27.473 --> 01:57:30.909
She's at the Johnson brothers warehouse.

01:57:30.944 --> 01:57:33.244
The old storage place.

01:57:33.279 --> 01:57:35.413
I know where it is.

01:57:35.448 --> 01:57:37.649
I know exactly where it is.

01:57:37.684 --> 01:57:41.486
Take this bitch and put her in a fucking cage

01:57:41.521 --> 01:57:43.454
and get everybody down there.

01:57:43.489 --> 01:57:44.956
You disgust me.

01:57:44.991 --> 01:57:47.258
Come on, get up.

01:57:47.293 --> 01:57:48.860
Come on.

01:57:48.895 --> 01:57:50.929
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:57:54.701 --> 01:57:55.867
I'm just pulling in right now,

01:57:55.902 --> 01:57:57.969
my dad's waiting for me.

01:57:58.004 --> 01:58:01.272
Brothers Johnson public
storage - you got it?

01:58:01.307 --> 01:58:04.909
Send in everybody.
Everybody!

01:58:29.836 --> 01:58:32.470
Yeah?

01:58:32.505 --> 01:58:34.939
What?

01:58:34.974 --> 01:58:38.843
Is she alive?

01:58:38.878 --> 01:58:40.245
Okay.

01:58:43.016 --> 01:58:46.251
Come on..
Come on!

01:59:01.434 --> 01:59:02.267
Dad!

01:59:32.699 --> 01:59:34.065
Stay in the fucking car!

01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:35.667
Those were the instructions.

01:59:35.702 --> 01:59:37.568
Stay in the fucking car!

02:00:06.599 --> 02:00:08.333
Motion detectors.

02:00:36.396 --> 02:00:37.929
It's a rat.

02:00:37.964 --> 02:00:41.099
Listen, son. We're
gonna need help here.

02:00:41.134 --> 02:00:42.834
Do you understand?

02:00:42.869 --> 02:00:45.370
Too many boxes, too many barrels.

02:00:45.405 --> 02:00:47.839
We can't go through them all alone.

02:00:54.914 --> 02:00:57.382
I think I know where she is.

02:00:57.417 --> 02:00:58.383
You do?

02:00:58.418 --> 02:00:59.617
I do.

02:00:59.652 --> 02:01:01.686
Follow your instinct.

02:01:16.536 --> 02:01:18.403
Oh, my god.

02:01:18.438 --> 02:01:21.873
Touch her neck and see if she's alive, dad.

02:01:21.908 --> 02:01:24.409
Yeah, she has a pulse.

02:01:24.444 --> 02:01:27.478
Come here, honey.
Come here, sweetie.

02:01:27.513 --> 02:01:31.015
Come on, come on, honey.

02:01:31.050 --> 02:01:34.419
Come on...
Come on.

02:01:34.454 --> 02:01:36.087
Put your arms here.

02:01:36.122 --> 02:01:37.789
God..

02:01:41.828 --> 02:01:44.662
I'm embarrassed.
I soiled myself.

02:01:44.697 --> 02:01:46.431
Don't be embarrassed, honey.

02:01:46.466 --> 02:01:48.065
You made our day.

02:02:23.636 --> 02:02:25.503
She's alive!

02:02:50.763 --> 02:02:52.263
Yes, sir.

02:02:52.298 --> 02:02:54.499
It's the president of the United States.

02:02:54.534 --> 02:02:55.733
He asked to speak to you.

02:02:55.768 --> 02:02:57.268
Mrs. Adams?

02:02:57.303 --> 02:02:58.736
Hello, John.

02:02:58.771 --> 02:03:01.939
I got two pieces of news for you.

02:03:01.974 --> 02:03:05.042
We found your granddaughter..

02:03:05.077 --> 02:03:07.512
Oh?

02:03:07.547 --> 02:03:09.847
..And she's alive.

02:03:09.882 --> 02:03:11.282
Oh!

02:03:16.055 --> 02:03:18.990
Oh.. She's alive.

02:03:19.025 --> 02:03:22.627
She's alive!

02:03:22.662 --> 02:03:25.296
Of course she's alive.

02:03:25.331 --> 02:03:30.001
She's an Adams.

02:03:40.713 --> 02:03:43.147
Jenny.. Jenny,
open your eyes.

02:03:43.182 --> 02:03:46.684
Open your eyes,
baby. Look at me.

02:03:46.719 --> 02:03:50.021
This is never gonna happen again, okay?

02:03:50.056 --> 02:03:53.324
I'm taking you to school
every day from now on.

02:03:53.359 --> 02:03:55.059
Are you okay?

02:04:04.737 --> 02:04:08.072
I promise this will never happen again.

02:04:08.107 --> 02:04:13.778
Come on, sweetie.
It's her daddy.

02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:43.774
Whatever you need and whenever you need it.

02:04:43.809 --> 02:04:46.310
Thank you.
