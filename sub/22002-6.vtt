00:00.867 --> 00:02.482
Okay... hole me.

00:04.219 --> 00:05.719
- Mm!
- Nothin' but mouth.

00:05.754 --> 00:08.121
- Whoa, impressive.
- Are you kidding me?

00:08.156 --> 00:09.679
That's uh-nothing.

00:09.715 --> 00:11.324
Diaz has been chucking D-holes

00:11.359 --> 00:13.093
into my mouth-piece since
we were back at the academy.

00:13.128 --> 00:14.294
Check this out.

00:34.216 --> 00:35.548
Oh!

00:35.584 --> 00:37.250
- Oh!
- Uh-oh.

00:37.285 --> 00:38.785
<i>Heads!</i>

00:38.820 --> 00:39.786
What the...?

00:42.557 --> 00:45.058
It's finally happening!

01:05.113 --> 01:08.148
Attention, Nine-Nine.
We have an announcement.

01:08.168 --> 01:10.235
"Shrek Live" is coming back to Broadway!

01:10.270 --> 01:11.511
- Nope, you dreamed that.
- Aw.

01:11.547 --> 01:14.239
We just came in here
to tell you to save the date,

01:14.274 --> 01:15.374
because we're getting
married on May 15th.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.808
We found a venue!

01:16.844 --> 01:18.777
Wow!

01:18.812 --> 01:21.113
Finding a place in the spring
in New York is impossible.

01:21.148 --> 01:24.082
Sharon and I had to get married
in Albany in December.

01:24.118 --> 01:25.650
Terry was too cold to consummate.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.519
- Hm, good to know.
- We got really lucky.

01:27.554 --> 01:30.122
The place was booked solid for the
next two years, but a couple fell out.

01:30.157 --> 01:31.556
Of a fifth-floor window.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.458
She was teetering and
he tried to grab her...

01:33.494 --> 01:35.060
Babe, we agreed we wouldn't
talk about that part.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.461
Right... sorry. It was gruesome.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.796
Never again. The EMTs said that

01:37.831 --> 01:39.364
it was a meat pancake. I'm done.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.832
So, tell us about the venue.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.367
Oh, well, there's not much to tell...

01:42.403 --> 01:44.102
other than it's a gorgeous mansion!

01:44.138 --> 01:45.670
- Big ol' house!
- With a professional kitchen.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.272
- Chop-chop, y'all!
- Ooh.

01:47.307 --> 01:48.340
A private library for the ceremony.

01:48.375 --> 01:49.341
My girl loves books!

01:49.376 --> 01:50.375
Seven bathrooms!

01:50.411 --> 01:51.676
No lines, ladies!

01:51.712 --> 01:52.744
And an outdoor reception area.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.413
Uh-can I get a gazebo?

01:56.250 --> 01:57.783
I apologize to a host of communities.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.668
The point is, these nuptials
are going to be "toit"!

02:00.704 --> 02:02.554
Speaking of "toit nups,"
we better get going,

02:02.589 --> 02:03.855
because we don't have
a lot of time and we have

02:03.891 --> 02:05.090
to meet with 17 wedding vendors.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.225
A jam-packed schedule
that could only be achieved

02:07.261 --> 02:08.526
by a type-A personality!

02:08.562 --> 02:10.228
- Jake.
- Yep, we gotta go.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.097
<i>I have some unfortunate news.</i>

02:12.132 --> 02:14.132
An NYPD officer has gone missing.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.600
The department suspects foul play.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.602
Oh, my God. Do we know the officer?

02:17.638 --> 02:19.337
Yes, it's...

02:19.373 --> 02:20.839
Sergeant Peanut Butter.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.308
- My nemesis.
- Your nemesis is a horse?

02:23.343 --> 02:24.743
Are you still mad at Peanut Butter

02:24.778 --> 02:26.611
because he won a medal
the same day as you?

02:26.647 --> 02:29.027
He totally upstaged me. He Tucci-ed me!

02:29.063 --> 02:30.650
Look what you get
if you do an image search

02:30.686 --> 02:32.818
of "Charles Boyle, medal of valor."

02:32.853 --> 02:35.287
Huh? They cropped me out
of my own photo!

02:35.691 --> 02:37.758
You just keep that tab open
on your phone all the time?

02:37.794 --> 02:39.474
No, I just looked it up real fast.
You didn't see.

02:39.510 --> 02:41.726
Captain, I solved it. Charles
kidnapped Peanut Butter.

02:41.762 --> 02:44.629
I did not.
But it's no surprise that somebody did.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.665
Hey, my kids love that horse.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.568
Your kids need help wiping
their butts, Sarge.

02:48.604 --> 02:50.702
They're not exactly geniuses.

02:50.737 --> 02:53.171
The actual suspect is Jesse Gurmwald,

02:53.207 --> 02:54.873
a disgruntled civilian admin

02:54.908 --> 02:57.175
who was recently fired
by the mounted unit.

02:57.211 --> 02:58.777
He's gone to ground,
but detectives throughout

02:58.812 --> 03:01.213
the city are checking
every possible hideout.

03:01.248 --> 03:03.782
Diaz, Boyle: here's a list
of locations in our precinct.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.250
- Be thorough.
- Yes, sir.

03:05.285 --> 03:06.798
And just to be clear,

03:06.834 --> 03:08.854
if I went missing, you
guys would conduct

03:08.889 --> 03:10.566
an equally thorough search, right?

03:11.825 --> 03:13.358
You should get going.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.360
So, we can wrap it in silk,

03:15.395 --> 03:17.662
or, for a more rustic feel... burlap.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.631
Oh... that's neat, but...

03:19.666 --> 03:21.733
We want these nups to be toit.

03:21.768 --> 03:23.468
- Excuse me?
- Could we wrap the flowers

03:23.504 --> 03:26.338
in "New York Times" crossword puzzles
from key dates in our lives?

03:26.373 --> 03:27.839
Oh... is that something you'd like?

03:27.875 --> 03:30.742
Uh, boi-oi-oi-oi-oing!

03:30.777 --> 03:32.844
Here's the deposit.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.746
I designed you a signature cocktail.

03:34.781 --> 03:36.314
I call it the "Peraltiago."

03:36.350 --> 03:37.682
Ooh!

03:39.486 --> 03:43.063
Mm... and the judges give
it a score of...

03:43.657 --> 03:45.857
Jeremy, did you make that cake
that I called you about?

03:45.893 --> 03:49.878
Yes, I wasn't entirely sure
if you were joking or not, but...

03:50.964 --> 03:52.464
A Nakatomi Plaza cake?

03:52.499 --> 03:54.232
The groom is on a licorice hose.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.867
Welcome to the wedding, pal.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.402
Oh, Amy.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.905
These nups may be getting too toit.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.274
Since Diaz and Boyle are
searching for Peanut Butter,

04:02.309 --> 04:04.743
I need you to be available to work
any cases that might come in.

04:04.778 --> 04:05.977
Of course, Captain. My pleasure.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.273
Morning, Amanda.

04:07.567 --> 04:09.281
Oh, and I thought we should transfer

04:09.316 --> 04:11.216
the Glenmoore assault to the Nine-Eight.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.851
Absolutely. Brian.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.405
Looking swole.

04:14.441 --> 04:16.488
You're looking swole. Is today leg day?

04:16.523 --> 04:18.990
Legs for an hour, two hours
blasting the glutes.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.226
Terry's got butt for days!

04:21.261 --> 04:22.393
Excuse me?

04:22.429 --> 04:24.496
I said, "Terry's got butt for days!"

04:24.531 --> 04:25.797
Please stop talking about my body.

04:25.832 --> 04:27.299
- What?
- I'm Teri.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.600
You just said I had "butt for days."

04:28.635 --> 04:30.602
Oh, I see what just happened.

04:30.637 --> 04:31.903
Terry's gonna regret this.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.538
- Are you threatening me?
- No!

04:33.574 --> 04:36.187
No, no. This is a misunderstanding.

04:36.223 --> 04:39.411
My name is also Terry,
and I was talking about my butt.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.712
So you were complimenting your own body?

04:40.747 --> 04:42.480
Well, I'm pretty proud of it.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.782
Do you know how old I am?

04:43.817 --> 04:46.351
Okay. Apology accepted.

04:46.386 --> 04:48.237
Seems pretty arrogant, though.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.755
This might not be the right time,

04:50.791 --> 04:52.757
but talking about yourself
in the third person

04:52.793 --> 04:54.726
- has finally...
- Terry knows!

04:54.761 --> 04:57.429
- I love our venue so much.
- Me too.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.965
It's like our very own Hogwarts.

04:59.001 --> 05:01.902
- Yes! And I'm Hermione.
- Yes! And I am Snape.

05:01.938 --> 05:03.301
- What?
- I never realized I could

05:03.337 --> 05:05.270
have feelings this strong
about a building.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.571
Okay, we just have to
drop off our deposit,

05:06.607 --> 05:08.273
and then we're done for the day.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.475
Well, it
would appear that we have achieved

05:10.510 --> 05:12.877
what scholars refer to
as the "toitest of nups"!

05:12.913 --> 05:13.979
Indeed!

05:14.014 --> 05:15.914
Ooh!

05:15.949 --> 05:17.415
Oh, hi Susan.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.783
- Hey.
- We're normal people.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.819
Hi, I was just about to call you guys.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.622
Ah, well, no need to call,
because we are here.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.890
- And we've got our deposit.
- Thank you so much.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.460
We just booked all our vendors.
It's really happening.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.961
Yeah, about that...

05:29.997 --> 05:31.663
Wait, what's wrong? Something's wrong.

05:31.698 --> 05:32.964
That's the look my mom
gave me right before

05:33.000 --> 05:34.666
she told me that my dad left.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.402
Oh, God, did my dad leave my mom again?

05:36.438 --> 05:37.902
- How do you know my mom and dad?
- You know, I'm so sorry.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.337
There must have been a mix-up.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.006
Someone just contacted my manager

05:41.041 --> 05:42.841
and booked the venue
before you got here.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.876
But we had an oral agreement.

05:44.911 --> 05:47.712
You said we had until
the end of the day... EOD.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.981
It's not EOD. The D hasn't E'd.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.850
It won't be E'd for ages!

05:51.885 --> 05:53.868
I'm sorry. It's out of
my hands, you know?

05:53.904 --> 05:55.771
Someone just swooped in and got it.

05:55.807 --> 05:57.722
Wait. Susan... Susan!

05:57.758 --> 06:00.325
Who? Who would do that?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.060
Amy, we had something great
in the palm of our hands,

06:02.095 --> 06:03.628
and then someone swooped
in at the last minute

06:03.664 --> 06:05.063
and stole it?

06:05.098 --> 06:06.564
There's only one person
who would do that.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.533
No. But... it couldn't be!

06:08.568 --> 06:09.634
Ah, but it is.

06:10.671 --> 06:11.736
The Vulture!

06:11.772 --> 06:13.471
Suckers.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.774
Oh, no. Our nups have been un-toitened.

06:15.809 --> 06:18.022
We've got loose nups.

06:19.069 --> 06:21.086
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:21.122 --> 06:22.721
What's your game here, Vulture, huh?

06:22.757 --> 06:23.889
Why are you renting our venue?

06:23.924 --> 06:25.157
Why do you think, meat farts?

06:25.192 --> 06:26.925
- I'm getting married.
- Really?

06:26.961 --> 06:28.727
You once told me that marriage
is for women and gays.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.263
And that the only thing you're married
to is banging married chicks.

06:31.298 --> 06:32.698
Yeah, and I meant it all.

06:32.733 --> 06:35.434
But love? Love hath changed me.

06:35.469 --> 06:37.803
No it hathn't.
You just vultured our venue.

06:37.838 --> 06:39.358
Yeah, but I did it for love.

06:39.394 --> 06:41.385
My fiancée, she means everything to me.

06:41.421 --> 06:43.842
You know, she's hot like a chick,
she's smart like a guy.

06:43.878 --> 06:45.210
Just talking to her
gives me a Harrelson.

06:45.246 --> 06:46.278
- Harrelson?
- Woody.

06:46.313 --> 06:47.946
- Ew.
- Yeah.

06:47.982 --> 06:49.415
Look, I know I've become
that gross, sappy guy,

06:49.450 --> 06:50.716
but dude, she's the first
chick I ever wanted

06:50.751 --> 06:51.950
to hang out with post-bang.

06:51.986 --> 06:53.975
I can't believe a real person
has agreed to marry you.

06:54.011 --> 06:55.387
Oh, my lady's real, all right.

06:55.423 --> 06:57.156
Her name is Jean Munhroe,

06:57.191 --> 06:59.058
and we complete the living hell
out of each other...

06:59.093 --> 07:00.426
sometimes twice a night.

07:00.461 --> 07:01.860
both groan]

07:01.896 --> 07:03.095
Hey, you know what?

07:03.130 --> 07:04.730
I need to handle this right now.

07:04.765 --> 07:06.331
Look, I know how hard
it is to find a venue.

07:06.367 --> 07:07.933
But if it could happen for me,
it could happen for you.

07:07.968 --> 07:10.269
It happened for you because
it did happen for us.

07:10.304 --> 07:11.503
Chins up, dingdongs.

07:11.539 --> 07:13.238
I'm trying to be happy over here.

07:13.274 --> 07:14.406
Ugh.

07:14.442 --> 07:16.041
Jake, what are we gonna do?

07:16.077 --> 07:18.010
We already gave deposits
to all our vendors.

07:18.045 --> 07:19.344
We're gonna get this place back.

07:19.380 --> 07:20.846
How? The Vulture's not gonna budge.

07:20.881 --> 07:24.403
Yeah, maybe, but he does
have a weak spot: his woman.

07:24.439 --> 07:26.452
Not that women are weak.
Just, she's our best shot,

07:26.487 --> 07:28.020
- and she happens to be a woman.
- Totally.

07:28.055 --> 07:29.922
Let's go talk to that spineless skank.

07:29.957 --> 07:31.457
Yeah.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.992
Why do we even have
police horses anymore?

07:34.028 --> 07:36.128
We have motorcycles now.
They're faster, cooler.

07:36.163 --> 07:37.863
They also don't get boners
in the background

07:37.898 --> 07:39.865
of every photo of you and the mayor.

07:39.900 --> 07:41.696
What do you mean?
A horse is a perfect partner.

07:41.732 --> 07:43.302
Tough, scary, and they don't show you

07:43.337 --> 07:46.238
30 pictures of their kid dressed
as Wario for Halloween.

07:46.273 --> 07:47.706
I'm not talking about Nikolaj.

07:47.742 --> 07:49.973
I literally just showed you
those pictures five minutes ago.

07:50.009 --> 07:51.808
Really? I don't remember that.

07:51.844 --> 07:52.809
Hmm.

07:57.017 --> 07:59.051
NYPD! Hands where we can see 'em!

07:59.086 --> 08:00.452
Step away from Peanut Butter.

08:00.488 --> 08:02.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on?

08:02.056 --> 08:03.889
You guys thought you could catch me?

08:08.963 --> 08:10.229
I'll head him off.

08:10.264 --> 08:12.164
Fine, I'll get the dumb horse.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.834
All right. Oh, boy, oh, boy.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.269
Come on, you idiot!

08:19.273 --> 08:20.239
Run!

08:20.274 --> 08:21.940
Ugh, you dumb horse.

08:21.976 --> 08:22.975
Ha!

08:24.278 --> 08:25.511
Peanut Butter!

08:30.417 --> 08:32.217
Stop! Peanut Butter, stop!

08:32.253 --> 08:33.585
- Stop!
- Boyle!

08:33.621 --> 08:35.486
Just let go!

08:35.523 --> 08:37.856
Okay, we have to force the She-Vulture,

08:37.892 --> 08:40.859
Jean Munhroe, to give us our venue
back, so put on your game face,

08:40.895 --> 08:42.327
'cause we're about to
stare down the devil.

08:42.363 --> 08:44.496
Devil can't stare if the
devil's got tears in her eyes

08:44.532 --> 08:45.597
and blood in her ears.

08:45.633 --> 08:47.065
Oh, I love your intensity.

08:47.101 --> 08:48.267
All right, this is where she works.

08:48.302 --> 08:49.835
"The Zenith Fund."

08:49.870 --> 08:51.436
Ulch, it even sounds evil.

08:51.472 --> 08:53.005
Of course it is.
She's marrying the Vulture.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.306
Everything about her is evil.

08:54.342 --> 08:57.808
Time to enter the den of bastards
who deserve to die.

08:59.046 --> 09:01.914
All right, snake, show your face...
it's a charity.

09:01.949 --> 09:03.348
Amy, it's a charity.

09:03.384 --> 09:05.417
Look at this: "Jean, your selflessness

09:05.452 --> 09:08.704
"puts us all to shame.
Humbled, Michelle Obama."

09:08.845 --> 09:11.056
Damn, Jean.

09:11.091 --> 09:12.891
Hi. Can I help you?

09:12.927 --> 09:15.294
Uh, yes. We're looking for Jean Munhroe.

09:15.329 --> 09:17.362
- We know her fiancé.
- Oh, I'm Jean.

09:17.398 --> 09:19.431
Are you Jake and Amy?

09:19.466 --> 09:21.066
Keith has told me all about you.

09:21.101 --> 09:22.634
- He says you guys are the best.
- Really?

09:22.670 --> 09:25.204
- Keith says that?
- Yeah... oh, Janice?

09:25.239 --> 09:27.439
That village needs rice.
Double the last shipment.

09:27.474 --> 09:29.901
Just take the overage
out of my paycheck.

09:30.277 --> 09:32.945
So, what brings you guys
to the Zenith Fund?

09:32.980 --> 09:35.514
Uh... actually,
something super important...

09:35.549 --> 09:37.149
Oh, I am so sorry.

09:37.184 --> 09:39.184
- I've gotta take this.
- Mm-hmm.

09:39.220 --> 09:40.802
What do you mean, "roadblock"?

09:40.838 --> 09:42.888
Do I have to fly down there
and talk to the rebels myself?

09:42.923 --> 09:44.456
Just get the rice to those kids.

09:44.491 --> 09:46.665
<i>Asante sana, Rafiki.</i>

09:47.094 --> 09:48.360
Sorry about that.

09:48.395 --> 09:50.095
Wow, your job sounds very intense.

09:50.130 --> 09:51.930
No, no, no, it's nothing
compared to what

09:51.966 --> 09:53.565
these children go through
on a daily basis.

09:53.601 --> 09:56.001
It really puts things in perspective.

09:56.036 --> 09:57.102
- Right.
- So,

09:57.137 --> 09:58.470
what was the important thing

09:58.505 --> 09:59.504
you came down here to talk about?

09:59.540 --> 10:02.207
Uh... the kids.

10:02.243 --> 10:04.443
- And the rice.
- And...

10:04.478 --> 10:07.735
putting the rice... in the kids.

10:08.148 --> 10:11.650
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have two new donors!

10:12.987 --> 10:14.086
Yay!

10:14.121 --> 10:15.487
Ooh, there's a bell.

10:15.522 --> 10:17.089
Oh!

10:17.124 --> 10:20.198
Do y'all have an ATM?

10:20.561 --> 10:24.029
Sir, can I get $350 in petty cash?

10:24.064 --> 10:26.598
I need to throw an ice cream party
for Teri-with-an-I, make sure

10:26.634 --> 10:28.567
- there's no hard feelings.
- Why?

10:28.602 --> 10:30.269
She gets it was a misunderstanding.

10:30.304 --> 10:32.170
She's a Teri, and you're a Terrance who,

10:32.206 --> 10:35.507
even though he's not a child,
still goes by a nickname ending in a Y.

10:35.542 --> 10:38.076
I mean, don't people call you Ray?

10:38.112 --> 10:39.344
How dare you.

10:39.380 --> 10:41.013
Sir, I don't want any tension

10:41.048 --> 10:43.348
between the squad
and the uniformed officers.

10:43.384 --> 10:45.118
I'm just thinking about the precinct.

10:45.154 --> 10:46.451
You're lying.

10:46.487 --> 10:48.186
You're upset because
Teri-with-an-I called you

10:48.222 --> 10:51.056
arrogant, and you have
a pathological need to be liked.

10:51.091 --> 10:53.125
What? No, I don't.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.993
I just happen to be a great person

10:55.029 --> 10:56.628
who's naturally beloved by all...

10:56.664 --> 10:58.887
despite my personal ambivalence.

10:58.923 --> 11:02.034
Well, if that's true, then you won't
mind walking across the bullpen

11:02.069 --> 11:04.369
without saying hello to anybody.

11:04.405 --> 11:05.704
No problem.

11:05.739 --> 11:07.472
No nods allowed.

11:07.508 --> 11:08.607
What?

11:08.642 --> 11:10.242
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

11:10.277 --> 11:12.010
You're a busy sergeant.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.179
They can't always expect you to
be friendly.

11:14.214 --> 11:15.981
Time to go to frown town.

11:16.016 --> 11:17.616
Let's do this, Jeffords.

11:17.651 --> 11:19.017
- Hey, Sarge.
- Bill!

11:19.053 --> 11:20.352
What up, man?

11:21.722 --> 11:22.721
You were right.

11:22.756 --> 11:24.990
Terry loves to be loved!

11:25.025 --> 11:27.592
Hey, Monica! Hey, Dough.

11:27.628 --> 11:30.362
Ooh, who wants a nod?

11:30.397 --> 11:33.031
Hey. Any luck finding a new venue

11:33.067 --> 11:34.633
- that's available on May 15th?
- Yeah.

11:34.668 --> 11:37.002
May 15, 2026.

11:37.037 --> 11:38.337
Please tell me the vendors
are giving us back

11:38.372 --> 11:39.671
- our deposits.
- Yes.

11:39.707 --> 11:41.306
One of them. The photographer.

11:41.342 --> 11:42.741
Provided that you hang out with him,

11:42.776 --> 11:44.176
so how do you feel about
spending the weekend

11:44.211 --> 11:45.277
on his houseboat in Yonkers?

11:45.312 --> 11:46.511
Ugh, Jake.

11:46.547 --> 11:48.080
Forget the perfect wedding.

11:48.115 --> 11:49.448
- We're screwed.
- I know.

11:49.483 --> 11:52.217
I can't believe that saint of a woman
is actually marrying the Vulture.

11:52.252 --> 11:53.785
Maybe he's changed.

11:53.821 --> 11:55.087
- How is that even possible?
- I don't know.

11:55.122 --> 11:56.288
Nothing makes sense anymore.

11:56.323 --> 11:58.790
The Vulture's not the Vulture,
good is bad, up is down,

11:58.826 --> 12:00.192
there's a young pope, winter has come.

12:00.227 --> 12:02.394
That reminds me: I ordered
some premium cable channels.

12:04.565 --> 12:06.498
Hitchcock? What was that sound?

12:06.533 --> 12:08.367
I just got an alert from my hookup app.

12:08.402 --> 12:11.269
I'm about to boink with a
local single in my area.

12:12.573 --> 12:13.772
- Ames.
- Jake.

12:13.807 --> 12:15.073
- Ames.
- Jake!

12:15.109 --> 12:16.144
- Ames!
- Jake!

12:16.180 --> 12:18.176
Up is up, down is down,
the Vulture still boinks!

12:19.242 --> 12:20.965
I need to handle this right now.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.898
I can't believe that bastard
is cheating on nice Jean.

12:22.934 --> 12:24.583
We have to save her.
We have to break them up.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.451
- For nice Jean!
- And the starving kids.

12:26.487 --> 12:28.153
- And Michelle Obama.
- And a little side benefit:

12:28.188 --> 12:29.970
if we break them up,
we get our venue back.

12:30.006 --> 12:31.556
Yes, but the main reason
is to save a wonderful person

12:31.592 --> 12:33.125
from making a horrible mistake.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.526
Of course. That's obviously the point.

12:34.561 --> 12:36.128
The venue is just secondary.

12:36.163 --> 12:37.262
What venue? We're great people.

12:37.297 --> 12:39.498
Hey, Jake.

12:40.228 --> 12:41.294
See?

12:41.886 --> 12:44.159
Okay, so the Vulture
is cheating on Jean Munhroe,

12:44.194 --> 12:46.348
which totally tracks, because
he is the epitome of awful.

12:46.384 --> 12:48.195
- Ooh, nice use of "epitome."
- Thanks, babe.

12:48.231 --> 12:49.697
My question is, why pretend to change?

12:49.732 --> 12:51.198
I mean, why get married at all?

12:51.234 --> 12:52.700
I'll tell you why.

12:52.735 --> 12:54.835
Because Jean's dad
is worth $100 million,

12:54.871 --> 12:56.370
and she's his only heir.

12:56.406 --> 12:57.931
Then why did she need our $1,000?

12:57.967 --> 13:00.341
I mean, I'm so happy we gave the money

13:00.376 --> 13:01.776
so the kids could have rice
and et cetera.

13:01.811 --> 13:03.377
- So, how do we break them up?
- Simple.

13:03.413 --> 13:04.945
We catfish him with
Hitchcock's hookup app.

13:04.981 --> 13:07.314
Then, when he takes the bait,
we make him end things

13:07.350 --> 13:09.250
with Jean respectfully and gently.

13:09.285 --> 13:10.718
Perfect. She hurts for a bit,

13:10.753 --> 13:12.286
but she eventually moves on,

13:12.321 --> 13:13.454
and she finds a much better man.

13:13.489 --> 13:16.223
Yes. And as a distant, secondary
benefit, we get the mansion back.

13:16.259 --> 13:17.709
Agreed. Okay.

13:17.745 --> 13:19.493
So, let's create a temptress

13:19.529 --> 13:21.429
- that will boink-match with him.
- Yeah.

13:21.464 --> 13:23.764
- What's the sexiest name?
- Valerie.

13:24.227 --> 13:26.293
That was fast. Do you know a Valerie?

13:26.329 --> 13:28.308
No. I wish.

13:29.305 --> 13:30.805
All right, she's 19,

13:30.840 --> 13:33.340
from Daytona, and her job
is "spray tannist."

13:33.376 --> 13:35.276
Ugh, "tannist." Not a real word.

13:35.311 --> 13:36.277
- It's perfect.
- Yeah.

13:36.312 --> 13:37.712
Okay, she's into

13:37.747 --> 13:39.780
spring break, bong rips, slurping shots,

13:39.816 --> 13:42.004
and crop tops that say "little cutie."

13:42.040 --> 13:43.987
- Noice.
- She is not into...

13:44.023 --> 13:46.687
nerds, wearing pants,
needy guys, monogamy,

13:46.723 --> 13:48.975
or feminism, and her quote is,

13:49.011 --> 13:50.982
"Whatever happened
to 'Girls Gone Wild'?"

13:51.018 --> 13:53.360
This Valerie sounds like a real pill.

13:54.964 --> 13:57.498
Okay. Let's see who our matches are.

13:57.533 --> 13:59.567
Here we go.

13:59.602 --> 14:01.244
Uh-huh.

14:01.280 --> 14:02.570
Gross, mm-hmm.

14:02.893 --> 14:04.726
Oh, Hitchcock.

14:04.762 --> 14:07.508
I mean, "Dave, age 28"?

14:07.543 --> 14:08.976
- Ugh.
- Come on.

14:09.011 --> 14:10.511
- Oh!
- Gotcha.

14:10.546 --> 14:12.429
There he is. All right.

14:12.465 --> 14:14.238
And so begins the delicate dance.

14:14.274 --> 14:16.293
We begin with a simple hello.

14:16.329 --> 14:18.103
And then we wait, so as
not to seem too aggressive...

14:18.139 --> 14:19.689
No, he sent us a picture of his penis!

14:20.757 --> 14:22.389
Oh, God, he just sent 15 more.

14:22.425 --> 14:23.591
Oh, God, it's horrible.
But it's wonderful.

14:23.626 --> 14:25.206
We're gonna save Jean!

14:25.242 --> 14:26.427
Yes, and we're gonna
get the mansion back!

14:26.462 --> 14:28.477
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, he put a little hat on it.

14:28.513 --> 14:29.545
Ugh.

14:29.866 --> 14:31.499
Hey, there you are.

14:31.534 --> 14:33.334
- You okay?
- Yeah, no burns.

14:33.369 --> 14:35.402
The doctor said I was lucky
my body was so damp.

14:35.438 --> 14:36.937
- So why did it take so long?
- Well, the EMT spent

14:36.973 --> 14:38.439
loads of time on Peanut Butter.

14:38.474 --> 14:39.507
But you know what?

14:39.543 --> 14:42.984
I don't care, because I saved
that dumb horse, so I'm the hero.

14:43.020 --> 14:46.367
And this time, when I get my medal,
my whole face will be in the picture.

14:46.403 --> 14:48.706
- You haven't seen "The Post," have you?
- What? No.

14:48.742 --> 14:49.884
- Why?
- Somebody was walking

14:49.919 --> 14:52.419
by the fire and took a picture
on their cell phone.

14:52.455 --> 14:55.589
What? That's not what happened.
I saved him.

14:55.625 --> 14:56.957
That's not how they're reporting it.

14:56.993 --> 14:59.026
No, look. "Daily News" got it right.

14:59.061 --> 15:00.494
Yeah.

15:00.530 --> 15:02.897
"Hero Cop Saves Helpless Buffoon."

15:02.932 --> 15:05.966
Oh, no. Am I the buffoon?

15:06.002 --> 15:07.911
Uh-oh, dropped your phone.
Now we'll never know.

15:07.947 --> 15:09.180
Wait.

15:09.216 --> 15:10.749
There was a dash cam in the car.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.339
We have footage of what really happened!

15:12.375 --> 15:14.557
Brass already called. They don't
want us releasing that footage.

15:14.593 --> 15:16.785
A hero horse is good PR
for the department.

15:16.821 --> 15:19.457
Hey, man, uh...
Peanut Butter's going on "Ellen."

15:19.493 --> 15:21.882
"Ellen"? That's my dream!

15:21.918 --> 15:25.099
Now he gets to dance with DJ tWitch!

15:25.822 --> 15:27.788
What's going on here?

15:28.108 --> 15:30.708
I'm throwing Teri-with-an-I's
party with my own money.

15:30.744 --> 15:32.390
I didn't know her favorite
kind of ice cream,

15:32.426 --> 15:34.054
so I printed a photo of her
and showed it

15:34.090 --> 15:36.616
to all the ice cream places
within 30 blocks.

15:36.652 --> 15:39.834
Nobody recognized her,
so I got every flavor... 200 pints.

15:39.869 --> 15:41.602
This is the greatest day of my life.

15:41.638 --> 15:44.038
Have you considered
this Teri-with-an-I might not

15:44.073 --> 15:46.540
- be an ice cream person?
- I did think that.

15:46.576 --> 15:48.223
That's why there's a taco bar coming.

15:48.259 --> 15:49.992
- Yes.
- Plus barbecue.

15:50.028 --> 15:51.111
- Yes.
- Plus a popcorn guy.

15:51.147 --> 15:52.680
- Yes.
- Plus vegan options.

15:52.715 --> 15:53.781
- Why?
- Sergeant,

15:53.816 --> 15:55.482
you've become unhinged.

15:55.518 --> 15:56.684
There's always gonna
be people in this world

15:56.719 --> 15:57.751
who don't like you.

15:57.787 --> 15:58.986
That's a fact of life.

15:59.021 --> 16:00.250
I hear you, sir.

16:00.286 --> 16:02.656
But I hate the feeling
of people being mad at me.

16:02.692 --> 16:04.425
So what?

16:04.460 --> 16:06.126
I was voted least friendly
in high school,

16:06.162 --> 16:07.595
and here I am, a police captain.

16:07.630 --> 16:09.563
Do you know what Mr. Popularity

16:09.599 --> 16:11.846
Vincent Mondale is doing these days?

16:11.882 --> 16:13.734
He's a sociologist, for God's sake.

16:13.769 --> 16:15.636
Sociologist, Terry.

16:15.671 --> 16:17.471
I'm sorry, but I gotta do this.

16:17.506 --> 16:19.374
Okay, but just know...

16:20.118 --> 16:22.151
if you go through with this party,

16:22.187 --> 16:23.619
I will like you less.

16:26.515 --> 16:27.982
Hello, Vulture. Got a minute?

16:28.017 --> 16:29.617
Doesn't matter. We don't care.

16:29.652 --> 16:31.418
Let me guess. You guys are here to cry

16:31.454 --> 16:32.753
about the wedding venue
that I stole from you

16:32.788 --> 16:34.622
- fair and square, right?
- No.

16:34.657 --> 16:36.590
Actually, we wanna talk to you
about some other things.

16:36.626 --> 16:39.193
Like spring break, slurping shots,

16:39.228 --> 16:40.928
and hating pants.

16:40.963 --> 16:43.352
Wait a second, why does
that sound familiar?

16:43.388 --> 16:46.165
I don't know.
Maybe you should ask... Valerie.

16:46.201 --> 16:48.202
Yeah, that's right. We catfished you.

16:48.237 --> 16:49.870
- Boom.
- You're Valerie?

16:49.906 --> 16:51.472
Ah, I can't believe I actually wasted

16:51.507 --> 16:53.596
my sweet dong snaps on you bozos.

16:53.632 --> 16:56.043
All right, here's how this is gonna go.

16:56.078 --> 16:57.845
You are gonna break up with Jean,

16:57.880 --> 17:00.681
because we all know you're just
marrying her for her money.

17:00.716 --> 17:02.149
You're gonna do it nicely
and respectfully,

17:02.184 --> 17:03.784
and you're gonna make
a generous donation

17:03.819 --> 17:04.984
- to her charity.
- Nice touch, Ames.

17:05.021 --> 17:06.185
You guys got it all wrong.

17:06.222 --> 17:07.488
I don't care that she's rich.

17:07.522 --> 17:08.521
Look, I love her.

17:08.557 --> 17:09.957
I just got spooked.

17:09.992 --> 17:11.191
You put a vulture into a cage, and...

17:11.227 --> 17:12.859
It freaks out.

17:12.895 --> 17:14.494
Actually, vultures do
very well in captivity

17:14.530 --> 17:16.864
- and they mate for life.
- Research burn.

17:16.898 --> 17:20.104
All right, look. I'm deleting the app
from my phone as we speak, okay?

17:20.140 --> 17:22.140
Come on. Jean's over 30.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.691
No amount of money in the entire world

17:23.727 --> 17:25.291
could make me marry a woman that old.

17:25.328 --> 17:26.640
But love can. And will.

17:26.675 --> 17:28.045
You have two options.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.347
Either you break up with her...

17:29.383 --> 17:31.078
Or we send her the penis pics...

17:31.113 --> 17:33.747
even the one next to the...
I'm guessing, a mini soda can?

17:33.783 --> 17:35.115
- Nah, it was regular size.
- Really?

17:35.151 --> 17:37.584
Oh, Jean's here. So what's it gonna be?

17:37.620 --> 17:40.187
You gonna tell her, or do we have to?

17:40.222 --> 17:41.789
- I've changed.
- Nope.

17:41.824 --> 17:43.123
- I won't do it again.
- Nope.

17:43.159 --> 17:44.792
I'll give you the venue.

17:44.827 --> 17:46.115
- Oh.
- What's that?

17:46.151 --> 17:48.062
I'll give you the venue
if you don't say anything,

17:48.097 --> 17:49.730
but if you do, I'm gonna keep it.

17:49.765 --> 17:52.078
Even if she and I break up, all right?
I love her.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.135
I promise you this.

17:54.570 --> 17:55.703
- Deal.
- Okay.

17:55.738 --> 17:57.237
Now just act normal, please.

17:57.273 --> 17:59.073
Oh, wow. What a surprise.

17:59.108 --> 18:01.008
- My donors.
- Hello, Jean Munhroe!

18:01.043 --> 18:03.495
Nice to see you, Jean Munhroe!

18:04.185 --> 18:05.973
You all looked so intense
when I got here.

18:06.009 --> 18:07.174
What were you talking about?

18:07.210 --> 18:08.175
- Crime scene.
- Soup.

18:08.211 --> 18:09.777
Uh... soup crime scene.

18:09.812 --> 18:11.640
The Chowder Killer's back at it again.

18:11.676 --> 18:13.409
Oh, I haven't heard of him.

18:13.445 --> 18:15.595
Yeah, well, he just moved
to Manhattan...

18:15.631 --> 18:17.397
from New England.

18:17.433 --> 18:19.895
You guys are so lucky
to all work together.

18:19.931 --> 18:22.972
Oh, my gosh, what is Keith like at work?

18:23.008 --> 18:25.042
Aw, Keith? Our Keith?

18:25.078 --> 18:26.468
Well, he's a real crack-up,

18:26.504 --> 18:27.670
I'll tell you that for free.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.595
We have so many inside jokes.

18:29.631 --> 18:31.019
- So many inside jokes.
- Mm-hmm.

18:31.055 --> 18:32.714
Hey, guys... potato salad?

18:34.637 --> 18:36.548
You wouldn't understand. It's from work.

18:36.584 --> 18:38.116
Oh, my gosh, you guys are so crazy.

18:38.152 --> 18:39.640
Yeah.

18:39.939 --> 18:41.272
So how did you two meet?

18:41.308 --> 18:42.943
Oh, someone stole from my charity,

18:42.979 --> 18:44.979
and another detective was
working on the case so hard

18:45.014 --> 18:47.216
for months, and Keith came in,

18:47.252 --> 18:49.486
and solved it right away.

18:49.522 --> 18:51.306
Swooped in like an eagle.

18:51.342 --> 18:53.309
That's why my nickname's the Eagle.

18:53.345 --> 18:54.711
- Right, guys?
- Yep.

18:54.747 --> 18:56.898
Everyone calls him...

18:57.093 --> 18:58.692
The Eagle.

18:58.728 --> 19:00.938
So, when did you decide to propose?

19:00.974 --> 19:04.532
Oh... ah, well, we were
just hanging out one night,

19:04.567 --> 19:07.835
and I looked over at Amy and it hit me.

19:07.870 --> 19:11.038
She's incredible and my best friend,

19:11.074 --> 19:13.174
and I just knew in that moment...

19:13.803 --> 19:15.403
I wanted to spend my life with her.

19:15.439 --> 19:18.099
I know what you mean.
Keith and I are the same way.

19:18.135 --> 19:21.082
It is so nice to finally find
someone I can trust.

19:21.117 --> 19:22.983
Oh, boy.

19:23.019 --> 19:25.143
- I can't do this.
- Yeah, it's bad.

19:25.179 --> 19:27.783
Jean, we have to show you something.

19:27.819 --> 19:29.757
- No!
- A penis? Why?

19:29.792 --> 19:31.984
Yep, should've explained it first.

19:32.124 --> 19:34.765
Reese Witherspoon is optioning
the Peanut Butter story?

19:34.801 --> 19:36.768
- What?
- Forget that dumb horse.

19:36.804 --> 19:38.204
Have you seen this?

19:40.141 --> 19:42.074
"Exclusive Dash Cam Footage Reveals

19:42.110 --> 19:44.277
Hero Cop Saved Sergeant Peanut Butter."

19:44.313 --> 19:46.544
I don't understand. How'd they get this?

19:46.580 --> 19:47.746
Somebody must have leaked it.

19:47.782 --> 19:49.163
Perfect partner isn't a horse.

19:49.199 --> 19:51.846
The perfect partner is somebody who,
no matter how much they hate you,

19:51.881 --> 19:52.980
would run through a fire
to save your life.

19:53.015 --> 19:55.062
Aw. Thank you, Rosa.

19:55.098 --> 19:57.609
You're welcome. All right, come with me.

19:57.645 --> 19:58.986
We're going to Shaw's.

19:59.021 --> 20:01.088
- Whoa, all this is for me?
- Yep.

20:01.124 --> 20:03.715
You saved Peanut Butter,
even though he's a dick.

20:03.751 --> 20:06.561
- He is a dick.
- To Charles Boyle, everybody!

20:06.597 --> 20:08.259
To Charles Boyle!

20:08.295 --> 20:09.897
Thanks, guys.

20:09.932 --> 20:12.171
So, Terry, you decided
not to throw a party

20:12.207 --> 20:14.073
- for Teri-with-an-I?
- You were right.

20:14.109 --> 20:15.603
Why bother trying to win over a stranger

20:15.638 --> 20:17.938
when I can make someone
I care about happy instead?

20:17.974 --> 20:20.341
Well, for the record, Jeffords...

20:20.973 --> 20:23.774
I like you a lot and I always have.

20:23.810 --> 20:25.946
All right. Whatever.

20:26.425 --> 20:27.724
I taught him well.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.913
Who am I kidding? Terry needs a hug!

20:29.949 --> 20:31.685
Mm?

20:33.089 --> 20:35.199
Hey, I'm still a little shaken up.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.158
- We did the right thing, right?
- Yes, definitely.

20:37.193 --> 20:39.001
She's way better off without him.

20:39.037 --> 20:40.261
And she let him know it.

20:40.296 --> 20:42.026
Yeah, for a human angel,
girl could throw down.

20:42.062 --> 20:43.495
I hate wasting rice...

20:43.531 --> 20:45.761
but I hate you more!

20:45.797 --> 20:47.596
She may be the coolest woman
I've ever met.

20:47.632 --> 20:49.379
- Yeah.
- So, what's up with the wedding?

20:49.415 --> 20:50.656
Do we need to find a new venue?

20:50.692 --> 20:52.940
Actually, we found a place
that's available on the same date.

20:52.975 --> 20:55.743
- Ooh, is it another mansion?
- No, it is not.

20:56.068 --> 20:57.782
Listen up, everybody!

20:57.818 --> 20:59.041
We are getting married

20:59.077 --> 21:01.073
- in a public rec center!
- Super cheap!

21:01.109 --> 21:02.774
- On a basketball court!
- Squeak-squeak!

21:02.810 --> 21:05.037
- With one working bathroom!
- Ladies gotta wait!

21:05.073 --> 21:06.506
And it's in deep Staten Island.

21:06.542 --> 21:08.055
Destination wedding, y'all!

21:08.507 --> 21:09.840
But the point is,

21:09.876 --> 21:12.793
these nuptials are still gonna be...
mad toit.

21:12.828 --> 21:14.128
I would marry you in a dumpster.

21:14.163 --> 21:16.263
Aww, I would marry you in a dumpster.

21:16.299 --> 21:18.784
Dudes, the Vulture's throwing

21:18.820 --> 21:21.988
an all-girl pudding wrestling
party in a mansion in May!

21:22.024 --> 21:24.808
It's the only important thing
happening that day!

21:25.422 --> 21:27.117
- After party?
- Fits our budget.
