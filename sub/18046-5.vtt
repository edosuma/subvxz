CHAPTER 05
WATER

01:27.212 --> 01:28.422
Hello, Ezequiel.

01:28.964 --> 01:30.716
You're not supposed to be here.
You're leaving--

01:30.799 --> 01:34.219
Please don't. I have something
very important to tell you.

01:34.303 --> 01:38.682
Last time I was here,
this cube caught my attention

01:38.765 --> 01:41.310
and I decided to run
the fingerprints on it.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.105
I assumed I would find your prints.

01:45.856 --> 01:49.735
But instead they were small...
the prints of a little boy.

01:55.157 --> 01:56.700
I need to show you something.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.002
Who is this boy, Ezequiel?

02:12.132 --> 02:14.551
Who is he? Who is this boy?

02:15.636 --> 02:17.012
Calm down, Ezequiel.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.598
Don't be like this.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.017
Calm down.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.436
-It doesn't have to be a scandal--
-Get out.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.940
I haven't submitted my report
to the Council yet.

02:29.566 --> 02:33.028
They still don't know,
and they don't have to know.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.905
What is that supposed to mean?

02:36.615 --> 02:41.078
Imagine being confined to the Recovery
and Treatment Center until you die. Awful.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.037
Or?

02:42.621 --> 02:43.830
You could...

02:44.915 --> 02:48.293
continue the year as supervisor
of the Process to the very end,

02:48.377 --> 02:50.253
like you've always done.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.715
Then you could resign. And after that...

02:55.675 --> 02:57.594
they'll have to name a successor.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.226
Naturally, I wouldn't be
the Council's first choice.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.769
They think I'm too young.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.189
But your recommendation...

03:11.191 --> 03:12.776
would go a long way.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.737
You...

03:18.115 --> 03:20.367
are much worse than I thought.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.372
Councilor Matheus told me...

03:26.832 --> 03:32.212
that when he was Process Leader,
he once caught you sitting in his chair,

03:32.295 --> 03:34.089
just to see how it felt.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.092
I don't remember that.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.052
But it worked out well for you.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.099
And it might just work out for me, too.

03:58.697 --> 04:01.616
[Aline] <i>Who is this boy, Ezequiel?</i>
<i>Who is he?</i>

04:02.325 --> 04:05.829
<i>Who is he? Who is this boy?</i>
[voice echoes, fading]

04:06.830 --> 04:07.873
Damn it!

04:07.956 --> 04:09.875
-Relax, honey.
-I can't do it.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.169
Calm down. Relax.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.337
[sighs] Baby...

04:14.713 --> 04:16.798
I keep thinking about
how Matheus' speeches

04:16.882 --> 04:20.886
were filled with so many good ideas
and references, with dates and quotes.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.764
-It's my first speech--
-Yes, it is your first speech.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.265
5 YEARS AGO
99TH PROCESS

04:25.348 --> 04:26.558
-Wow.
-[Ezequiel] What?

04:26.641 --> 04:29.936
-I think you need to come with me.
-Babe, I have to finish this.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.689
I know. But you'll never get it
when you're this tense.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.650
-Where are you taking me?
-It's a surprise. Come on.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.116
Honey, you're taking me
to the bathroom? What--

04:43.200 --> 04:44.034
[both chuckle]

04:44.117 --> 04:45.035
What...?

04:45.952 --> 04:48.997
-Baby, I have to finish my speech.
-Close your eyes.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.874
-What?
-Close your eyes.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.711
Close your eyes and take a deep breath.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.589
Clear your mind.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.009
Just keep your focus on your breathing.

05:02.177 --> 05:04.221
Listen to the sound of the water.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.723
Feel how fresh the water is.

05:07.516 --> 05:08.767
Smell it.

05:15.941 --> 05:18.318
You create your own merit.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.947
Everything is going to work out.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.533
Because you deserve it.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.493
Now, take another breath.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.089
Feel the water.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.928
Can you feel it?

05:49.224 --> 05:50.684
What did you say to me?

05:51.518 --> 05:54.271
You create your own merit.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.815
"You create your own merit."

05:57.399 --> 05:59.192
[Julia] <i>And everything will work out.</i>

06:00.026 --> 06:01.611
<i>Because you deserve it.</i>

06:02.070 --> 06:03.989
[Ezequiel] <i>"Everything will work out.</i>

06:04.698 --> 06:06.658
<i>Because you deserve it."</i>

06:06.741 --> 06:07.993
[Julia] <i>Never forget that.</i>

06:08.076 --> 06:11.955
Whoever said we couldn't have
a sink in here... It's perfect.

06:12.038 --> 06:15.333
A respectable Process Leader
deserves a respectable room.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.835
Will you help me with this?

06:23.383 --> 06:26.136
Only three percent of you

06:26.219 --> 06:28.888
will have the honor
of going to the Offshore.

06:28.972 --> 06:29.806
Remember...

06:31.016 --> 06:34.978
you create your own merit.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.940
Everything will work out,
because you deserve it.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.776
[Julia] That was beautiful.
Congratulations.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.236
[Ezequiel] I gave it my best.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.031
-[Julia] I'll see you later.
-Where are you working today?

06:46.114 --> 06:49.701
Well, well, Process Leader,
you should know that.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.166
What the...?

07:08.345 --> 07:10.764
INTERVIEWS
CANDIDATES

07:14.935 --> 07:18.104
[overlapping conversations]

07:19.022 --> 07:20.273
How many siblings?

07:21.942 --> 07:25.445
What if I asked you to choose
between you and your girlfriend? Why?

07:25.528 --> 07:26.363
ANSWER: INCORRECT

07:27.113 --> 07:28.531
I'm sorry, you're eliminated.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.116
You passed.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.451
You passed. Eliminated.

07:32.077 --> 07:32.911
Eliminated.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.037
Congratulations.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.956
How does it feel to be sitting there?

07:36.039 --> 07:39.250
I guess to me it feels really amazing
to be a part of it all.

07:39.334 --> 07:42.796
Because we rarely get to be together.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.464
The thing is, I have a small daughter.

07:45.590 --> 07:49.719
But everything has been taken care of.
She's staying with my mother.

07:49.803 --> 07:53.932
And if everything works out, one day
I'll see her again on the Offshore.

07:54.015 --> 07:58.228
I'm sorry-- I'm sorry to say this, Talita,
but you're eliminated.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.855
Uh, what...?

08:01.481 --> 08:02.899
Was it something I said?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.317
No, not at all.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.070
The Process thanks you for participating
and asks you to remember--

08:07.153 --> 08:09.614
No, ma'am! Please! Please, ma'am!

08:09.698 --> 08:12.575
-What did I answer wrong?
-Eliminated candidate, Booth 19.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.286
Ma'am, no! For God's sake!
Please! Any question you want!

08:15.370 --> 08:18.331
I can answer it again!
I can change my answer if you want!

08:18.415 --> 08:19.833
Please, ma'am! No!

08:19.916 --> 08:22.669
I can do it! Ask me anything,
one more question!

08:22.752 --> 08:24.504
I can give you any answer...

08:24.587 --> 08:27.674
And then he said, "If this isn't normal,

08:27.757 --> 08:30.135
then I've been doing it wrong
for 20 years."

08:30.218 --> 08:31.928
[all laugh]

08:32.971 --> 08:35.974
-Can I make an observation?
-[Ezequiel] Yes.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.226
Regarding this candidate...

08:39.019 --> 08:40.520
and the reason for her elimination.

08:40.602 --> 08:42.188
It's not clear to me.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.858
It was clear to me.
Reason for elimination number six:

08:44.941 --> 08:46.735
Weak psychological construct.

08:47.110 --> 08:50.488
Her desire to pass was weak.
She had low self-esteem.

08:50.572 --> 08:53.616
The polygraph didn't detect that
during her application.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.035
No oscillations on the curve--

08:55.118 --> 08:57.746
It was very clear to me.
I evaluated her.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.749
Oh, sure.

09:01.291 --> 09:04.753
It's just common for us
to double-check and try to clear

09:04.836 --> 09:06.963
any trace of subjectivity
from an evaluation.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.798
[Julia] Yes, of course.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.426
It was just so obvious to me.
I had no doubt.

09:12.093 --> 09:15.221
-Look, Julia, I'm just trying to--
-Guys, please.

09:15.305 --> 09:18.933
I don't want to waste any more time
on these evaluations.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.728
We still have to prepare the doors test,

09:21.811 --> 09:24.522
and it needs a lot of work.
All right? Let's get to it.

09:24.606 --> 09:27.817
Fine. As long as you're not doing this
to get your wife off the hot seat.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.569
[all laugh]

09:29.652 --> 09:32.655
My promotion has to be good
for something, right?

09:32.739 --> 09:34.449
[woman] Ah! [chuckles]

09:34.532 --> 09:36.409
So, let's get back to the tests.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.870
Walmir had a good suggestion...

09:38.953 --> 09:40.622
[dialogue fading out]

09:46.795 --> 09:48.713
-[Julia] It's almost over.
-[Ezequiel] It is over.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.256
[Julia] Until next year.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.591
[sighs]

09:51.674 --> 09:52.675
Thank God.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.094
How do you feel?

09:54.636 --> 09:55.678
Good.

09:56.638 --> 10:01.142
This year's three percent will make
excellent additions to our society.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.560
[chuckles]

10:02.644 --> 10:04.521
What, Julia? Why are you laughing?

10:04.604 --> 10:08.358
Maybe you should save that speech
for Matheus and the Council,

10:08.441 --> 10:11.778
and just tell your devoted wife
how you really feel.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.655
-How I really feel?
-Mm-hm.

10:17.075 --> 10:17.992
Exhausted.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.706
[Julia] <i>Now, I want you</i>
<i>to close your eyes...</i>

10:24.082 --> 10:25.208
<i>and taste it.</i>

10:25.792 --> 10:27.127
<i>Can you guess the flavor?</i>

10:27.210 --> 10:28.253
-[Ezequiel] <i>Wood.</i>
-[Julia] <i>Wood?</i>

10:28.336 --> 10:30.463
<i>-What type of wood?</i>
-[Ezequiel] <i>I don't know.</i>

10:31.840 --> 10:34.092
[Julia] <i>Take a deep breath</i>
<i>and use your senses.</i>

10:34.175 --> 10:35.760
<i>Now try this one.</i>

10:35.844 --> 10:38.596
<i>Feel the wine's aroma</i>
<i>in every corner of your mouth.</i>

10:38.680 --> 10:42.600
Honey, how many more glasses?
Our ride to the Offshore leaves in--

10:42.684 --> 10:45.228
-[Julia] <i>You think too much.</i>
-[Ezequiel] <i>But we have a schedule--</i>

10:45.311 --> 10:49.816
[Julia] <i>Turn off that part of your mind</i>
<i>and just feel. We're celebrating.</i>

10:52.652 --> 10:55.446
-[Ezequiel] <i>Wait, this can't be--</i>
-[Julia] <i>What? Tell me.</i>

10:55.530 --> 10:58.658
I taste... Brazilian grapes?

10:58.741 --> 11:00.535
-Mmm.
-And what else?

11:01.077 --> 11:02.287
[Ezequiel] <i>Black pepper.</i>

11:04.539 --> 11:07.333
It looks like the Process Leader
has just chosen the wine

11:07.417 --> 11:09.919
<i>that we will drink to celebrate</i>
<i>the end of every year.</i>

11:10.003 --> 11:11.838
You're always teaching me.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.347
[objects clattering]

11:23.933 --> 11:26.895
This is my second year
as Process Leader...

11:26.978 --> 11:28.271
1 YEAR LATER
100TH PROCESS

11:28.354 --> 11:30.648
...and I am very happy to welcome you.

11:30.732 --> 11:34.152
I imagine
that you are all terribly nervous.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.447
But if I may offer some advice:

11:38.072 --> 11:44.037
Remember...
you each create your own merit.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.290
But I enjoyed conducting the interviews.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.835
-I was comfortable there.
-I know, honey, I know.

11:50.919 --> 11:54.172
But I want you to watch over
the overall Process. You understand?

11:54.255 --> 11:55.131
[Julia] Mm-hm.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.968
-I have a small daughter.
-You're eliminated.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.386
I can answer...

12:00.470 --> 12:02.597
Ezequiel,
does this have something to with...

12:03.514 --> 12:06.476
-with that candidate I eliminated?
-Who?

12:06.559 --> 12:08.102
From last year.

12:08.186 --> 12:10.104
-Who?
-Talita, Ezequiel.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.900
Of course not, Julia!
This is like a promotion.

12:13.983 --> 12:17.654
You are going to be assisting
the Process Leader. You understand?

12:18.529 --> 12:21.574
You're going to help me manage everything.
I want you close to me.

12:22.575 --> 12:26.329
All the images from the control center
are streamed here.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.039
The external cameras.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.041
-[Julia] Mm-hm.
-The tests.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.587
And the Inland cameras.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.464
-[Julia] Wow, that's a lot of cameras.
-Mm-hm.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.925
I didn't realize we had so many
on their side.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.468
More every day.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.846
After Cássia was appointed
head of security, we expanded.

12:44.430 --> 12:49.936
This is very important for census control,
population analysis...

12:50.436 --> 12:52.897
and naturally,
to keep an eye on the Cause.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.441
-[gunshots on video]
-RK-712, Unit 2 has targeted

12:55.525 --> 12:58.361
-a group of suspects in the plaza.
-[man 1] <i>Sons of bitches.</i>

12:58.444 --> 13:00.822
[man 2]
<i>Approaching target area, 70 meters.</i>

13:00.905 --> 13:02.031
[man 1] <i>No, no, careful!</i>

13:02.115 --> 13:05.201
-Weapon down. Weapon down.
-[man 2] <i>At 50 meters, turn left.</i>

13:06.077 --> 13:08.121
-Careful, there's a civilian.
-[man 2] <i>Turn right.</i>

13:08.204 --> 13:09.163
A little further.

13:09.247 --> 13:10.248
Do you have confirmation?

13:10.331 --> 13:11.833
If they're rebels,
I need to show Ezequiel.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.668
-[man 2] <i>Turn right at the stairs.</i>
-[man 1] <i>Back me up!</i>

13:13.751 --> 13:16.379
-[man 2] <i>Approaching the plaza.</i>
-[man 1] <i>Don't run!</i>

13:16.462 --> 13:18.548
-[man 1] <i>Stop!</i>
-[man 2] <i>On the ground, on the ground!</i>

13:18.631 --> 13:20.550
<i>Get down! Get down!</i>

13:20.633 --> 13:22.010
<i>On the ground, on the ground!</i>

13:24.470 --> 13:26.389
Ezequiel, 247.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.807
247, what happened?

13:27.890 --> 13:30.435
-We just captured a unit from the Cause.
-[Ezequiel] Zoom in.

13:30.518 --> 13:31.436
There.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.482
<i>Sir! A man's been shot.</i>

13:36.566 --> 13:38.151
<i>A stray bullet.</i>

13:38.234 --> 13:39.152
[man] <i> This way!</i>

13:39.235 --> 13:40.945
[woman]
<i>There's a child there, too.</i>

13:41.529 --> 13:44.991
<i>-He's not with the Cause!</i>
-[man] <i>Calm down, ma'am, calm down.</i>

13:50.621 --> 13:51.873
[Cássia] Situation.

13:52.582 --> 13:53.708
Situation!

13:55.126 --> 13:57.670
[man] <i>Negative. Collateral damage.</i>
<i>We have a casualty.</i>

13:57.754 --> 13:59.088
-Get him out of there now.
-[Ezequiel] Now!

13:59.172 --> 14:01.215
<i>Three, two, one. Let's go!</i>

14:01.299 --> 14:02.300
<i>Open the door.</i>

14:06.095 --> 14:07.096
[Ezequiel] Let's go.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.849
-Where are they taking them?
-Who? The body?

14:09.932 --> 14:12.602
-No, the Cause members.
-They're bringing them here.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.772
[Julia] Rewind.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.815
No, no, no!

14:18.649 --> 14:19.901
The boy. I want to see the boy.

14:24.906 --> 14:25.907
[gasps]

14:30.036 --> 14:31.162
[voice quavers] Zoom in.

14:43.257 --> 14:46.135
[gasps, sobs softly]

15:02.151 --> 15:03.528
[sniffles]

15:09.534 --> 15:10.368
[bell rings]

15:12.328 --> 15:13.663
[Ezequiel over speaker] <i>Julia.</i>

15:13.746 --> 15:16.207
<i>They need your help downstairs.</i>

15:16.290 --> 15:18.835
<i>There's an issue</i>
<i>with an eliminated candidate.</i>

15:20.962 --> 15:21.921
<i>Honey?</i>

15:23.172 --> 15:24.507
Okay, I'm coming.

15:30.388 --> 15:33.558
The agent showed me
a totally random picture and said:

15:33.641 --> 15:34.892
"Tell me what's wrong here."

15:34.976 --> 15:38.604
Then he changed the picture and said
the shadow was in the wrong place,

15:38.688 --> 15:41.357
-but it wasn't--
-Silence, please. You've told me all this.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.193
Listen! What happened to me
was totally unfair.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.945
Congratulations, you figured it out.

15:46.028 --> 15:49.198
It's a really unfair Process, but you have
to leave, because this unfair Process

15:49.282 --> 15:51.409
-doesn't want you here.
-You're admitting it was wrong?

15:51.492 --> 15:53.536
I want to talk to the Process Leader.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.288
Or anyone higher ranked than you.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.665
The recommendations
for your recovery include

15:57.748 --> 16:00.585
not talking about or thinking about
what happened during the Process.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.087
The memories can be very painful.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.756
The joy of having children
is one of the most efficient methods--

16:05.840 --> 16:07.884
I don't care!
You have to take me back!

16:07.967 --> 16:11.596
-I've told you a thousand times already!
-No!

16:14.307 --> 16:16.350
Enough! It's over for you!

16:17.310 --> 16:18.644
Get out of here!

16:18.728 --> 16:21.647
Easy for you to say.
You have everything, bitch.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.109
What did you say?

16:26.068 --> 16:26.986
What did you say?

16:27.570 --> 16:28.988
What did you say? Say it again!

16:30.990 --> 16:33.117
You don't know anything about my life!

16:39.790 --> 16:42.919
<i>Ezequiel, Julia is a little stressed out,</i>
<i>don't you think?</i>

16:43.294 --> 16:45.213
-Yes.
<i>-Have you thought about</i>

16:45.296 --> 16:47.507
<i>giving her a little break</i>
<i>from all the pressure?</i>

16:47.590 --> 16:52.553
<i>Maybe she could spend some time</i>
<i>in the Recovery and Treatment Center.</i>

16:52.637 --> 16:53.721
<i>There's no shame in that.</i>

16:53.804 --> 16:56.557
There's no need for that, Matheus.

16:56.641 --> 16:59.435
It's not uncommon for agents
to get carried away now and then.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.187
-You know that.
<i>-Yes, I know.</i>

17:01.270 --> 17:06.067
<i>But what if she spent one month</i>
<i>at the RTC?</i>

17:06.150 --> 17:08.986
No. Let me handle this, okay?
I'll deal with it.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.280
<i>In addition to managing</i>
<i>the entire Process?</i>

17:11.364 --> 17:14.157
Yes, Matheus. In addition to managing
the entire Process.

17:14.242 --> 17:18.037
<i>Are you sure you don't want me there</i>
<i>to give you some assistance?</i>

17:18.119 --> 17:19.038
No.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.000
I appreciate the offer,
but it really isn't necessary.

17:23.792 --> 17:24.877
[Matheus sighs]

17:25.461 --> 17:26.337
<i>Think about it.</i>

17:27.713 --> 17:29.048
I will.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.470
[Julia] He's right.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.765
I lost it.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.017
I shouldn't have struck the candidate.

17:53.322 --> 17:56.617
-Does it bother you to be here?
-No. Everything's fine.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.745
They talked to me about it.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.415
I won't be working with candidates
for a while.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.126
I was wondering...

18:09.046 --> 18:12.508
if maybe you don't really
want to be working here.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.634
What do you mean?

18:13.884 --> 18:16.929
I'm sure some of the departments
on the Offshore

18:17.013 --> 18:18.306
would kill to have you.

18:19.807 --> 18:20.725
You know?

18:21.183 --> 18:23.644
And if I went back,
would you come with me?

18:25.563 --> 18:29.108
Eventually, yes.
But now that I'm the Process Leader...

18:30.151 --> 18:30.985
I get it.

18:31.819 --> 18:32.737
What is it?

18:34.655 --> 18:36.699
You're trying to get rid of me.

18:36.782 --> 18:37.658
Julia...

18:39.577 --> 18:41.746
It's the opposite of that.
On the contrary--

18:41.829 --> 18:42.830
Ezequiel?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.124
I can come back.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.209
[door slides shut]

18:51.130 --> 18:52.590
Forget what I said.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.551
I just want to understand what's going on.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.055
-I want to help. Something is--
-There's nothing wrong.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.848
-There is.
-There's nothing wrong.

19:01.599 --> 19:02.558
Trust me.

19:04.185 --> 19:06.145
Come on. Let's go to bed.

19:07.063 --> 19:10.024
-Come.
-I think I'll stay up a little longer.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.525
I need to study.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.819
After what happened today,

19:13.903 --> 19:17.156
I don't want to fall behind
on my responsibilities.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.760
[door slides shut]

20:01.826 --> 20:03.244
I want a copy.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.205
[Ezequiel] Honey?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.542
Julia? Are you coming?

20:10.334 --> 20:11.502
On my way, darling.

20:14.505 --> 20:15.339
[Ezequiel] Come on.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.175
Let's celebrate the end of year two.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.469
-Let's.
-Let's.

20:21.721 --> 20:25.141
-That's the wine we picked, right?
-That's the one. Was it hard to find?

20:25.808 --> 20:27.768
-A little-- Honey!
-[glass shatters]

20:29.270 --> 20:30.813
Step aside. You're barefoot.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.357
Come on.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.778
-Sorry, baby.
-It's okay.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.740
Don't cut your feet.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.412
I am...

20:46.704 --> 20:48.330
I'm sorry, babe. I'm...

20:49.749 --> 20:52.626
-I don't know.
-What's happening? Are you okay?

20:52.710 --> 20:53.794
Yes.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.129
I'm okay.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.215
Everything will be okay.

21:03.387 --> 21:06.891
1 YEAR LATER
101ST PROCESS

21:13.481 --> 21:14.565
[Ezequiel] <i>Three percent.</i>

21:15.483 --> 21:18.152
In a few days,
only three percent of you...

21:18.736 --> 21:22.031
will be in a select group
heading to the Offshore.

21:22.490 --> 21:25.284
<i>Only the deserving three percent,</i>

21:25.367 --> 21:28.287
<i>only the best among you</i>
<i>will pass the Process.</i>

21:28.996 --> 21:31.248
<i>It was quite different in the past...</i>

21:42.885 --> 21:44.845
Speech.
-[Ezequiel continues]

21:44.929 --> 21:46.388
Operation 247.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.308
<i>I expect you to give everything you have.</i>

21:50.684 --> 21:52.895
<i>After all these years of sacrifice...</i>

21:52.978 --> 21:55.648
-Location.
<i>-...we now live in a perfect society</i>

21:55.731 --> 21:57.358
<i>where there's justice for all</i>

21:57.441 --> 21:59.902
-<i>and everyone has the same chance.</i>
-House address?

21:59.985 --> 22:02.029
[Ezequiel] <i>Remember, you create...</i>

22:02.112 --> 22:03.656
Where is the house?

22:04.281 --> 22:06.408
-[Ezequiel] <i>Everything will work out...</i>
-[Julia] <i>Address.</i>

22:06.492 --> 22:08.202
...because you deserve it.

22:12.289 --> 22:16.168
<i>Now, I think gratitude is in order, right?</i>
<i>Repeat after me.</i>

22:16.252 --> 22:18.838
-What's the street number?
<i>-We are grateful for the chance...</i>

22:18.921 --> 22:22.341
<i>for a better life. I welcome you all.</i>

22:30.558 --> 22:32.351
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, babe.

22:32.810 --> 22:33.644
What's going on?

22:34.436 --> 22:37.356
I was watching your speech from here.
It was great as always.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.484
What are you doing?

22:41.026 --> 22:44.863
Analyzing some candidate files
to help the interviewers.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.866
-In case they need it.
-Oh, great.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.369
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.955
I'm gonna keep working.
I have a meeting shortly.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.294
[door slides shut]

23:13.809 --> 23:15.144
[Julia] I want to see the house.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.396
Show me the front door?

23:20.608 --> 23:21.942
Street sign?

23:22.443 --> 23:23.360
Street number?

23:23.444 --> 23:25.946
A name? Number? Sign?

23:27.656 --> 23:28.782
[sighs]

23:52.473 --> 23:54.475
Operation 247.

24:03.150 --> 24:06.153
127 VIEWS

24:26.465 --> 24:27.966
We need to talk.

24:34.056 --> 24:35.182
[Ezequiel sighs]

24:37.976 --> 24:39.937
The footage of the operation...

24:41.105 --> 24:43.524
you watched it over 100 times.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.612
You have to tell me, Julia.

24:50.406 --> 24:53.951
Or you'll end up having to tell
a specialist at the RTC.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.754
This is not an investigation, okay?

25:07.339 --> 25:10.008
I want you to share your problem with me.

25:10.092 --> 25:12.386
You are my wife, the one I love.

25:13.470 --> 25:16.306
I want you to be able to tell me anything.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.600
That will never change.

25:18.684 --> 25:19.643
I know.

25:23.814 --> 25:26.400
But you have to promise me
it will stay between us.

25:26.483 --> 25:27.693
Absolutely.

25:28.610 --> 25:29.570
Of course.

25:35.409 --> 25:36.493
I had a son.

25:40.497 --> 25:41.623
What?

25:41.707 --> 25:43.917
Before the Process. Before I met you.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.879
You had a son?

25:46.962 --> 25:48.756
I have a son, Ezequiel.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.550
Julia, what...?

25:51.925 --> 25:53.886
He's the boy in the footage.

25:54.470 --> 25:55.721
No...

26:03.687 --> 26:05.564
How is that not in your file?

26:07.191 --> 26:08.650
I had no family, Ezequiel.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.904
He was registered by my neighbor.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.031
-And the father?
-He doesn't matter.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.450
Doesn't matter?
What do you mean "doesn't matter"?

26:16.533 --> 26:18.452
-He doesn't matter.
-Doesn't matter?

26:19.495 --> 26:21.038
He never wanted the boy.

26:24.917 --> 26:28.504
When you have a baby before you are 20,
the mother...

26:29.338 --> 26:31.298
hardly even sees the baby.

26:32.257 --> 26:34.301
They say it's better
to not even name the child,

26:34.384 --> 26:37.513
and wait and see
if you get through the Process first.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.639
[Julia sobbing]

26:38.722 --> 26:40.641
So, I didn't name him.

26:44.311 --> 26:47.147
But then, one night,
it was just the two of us.

26:49.525 --> 26:52.402
I was telling him a story
that he used to love.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.202
And I called him Augusto.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.372
It's all right, Julia.

27:04.039 --> 27:06.375
-It's not, Ezequiel.
-It's all right.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.419
The person taking care of him died,
and it's our fault.

27:09.503 --> 27:11.505
-"Collateral damage."
-Julia...

27:11.880 --> 27:12.840
Julia...

27:15.175 --> 27:16.218
I want to see him.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.389
You know that's impossible.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.057
He's all alone, Ezequiel.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.893
In a few years,
he will apply to the Process.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.939
If he passes, you will meet again.

27:29.022 --> 27:29.982
What if he doesn't?

27:31.024 --> 27:33.485
Then he doesn't deserve
to be missed at all.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.447
Because he's one of them...
not one of us.

27:37.531 --> 27:40.033
-It doesn't work like that, Ezequiel.
-Julia...

27:40.117 --> 27:41.034
It doesn't.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.744
What's going on?

27:43.537 --> 27:44.830
You're not yourself.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.331
We are not ourselves!

27:47.791 --> 27:50.961
Can't you see that all of this
is a big mistake?

27:51.044 --> 27:53.630
-All of what?
-Everyone we left behind!

27:54.131 --> 27:55.591
My son who was left behind!

27:55.674 --> 27:58.218
What you're saying makes no sense!

27:59.177 --> 28:01.430
-It's a disease, it's not you.
-He has to be with me.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.390
He needs to be with me.

28:03.473 --> 28:06.435
-This is all wrong.
-You're not thinking straight.

28:08.729 --> 28:11.857
I saw your Process on the Offshore.
You love the Offshore as much as I do.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.400
I want to see my son!

28:14.943 --> 28:16.320
And who says he wants to see you?

28:24.119 --> 28:26.830
You know what you're asking
is impossible.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.251
This goes against everything
we believe in. What you believe--

28:31.335 --> 28:33.629
You don't know what I believe in!

28:34.838 --> 28:38.217
You only see in me

you can change everyone's mind?

28:43.013 --> 28:45.807
Sometimes you can, but not always!

28:48.852 --> 28:50.729
I love you for who you are.
