WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:06.920
This programme contains some violent
scenes and some strong language
from the start

00:06.920 --> 00:11.320
We have to track down Dardis. Did
your husband ever mention Goliath?
He was an assassin.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.080
Pat Keenan is dead, so Goliath is
dead.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.160
Where are we going? Another safe
house.

00:15.160 --> 00:16.760
I know where the gold is.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.240
GUN FIRES

00:20.840 --> 00:22.800
The gold belonged to Goliath.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.120
The man's dead, Niamh. End of story.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.280
Who stole it?

00:26.280 --> 00:29.320
A criminal organisation called the
Savage Family are responsible.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.840
What are you doing here? I'm the guy
who owns the gold.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.880
It's footage from the neighbour's
doorbell camera.

00:38.880 --> 00:40.000
KNOCKING

00:40.000 --> 00:41.520
What are you doing here, Birdy?

00:41.520 --> 00:43.000
Did you kill Rob Dardis?

00:44.120 --> 00:45.440
Are you going to kill me?

00:45.440 --> 00:47.440
I'm arresting you for... Birdy, turn
that off.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.280
It's your gun, Tom...

00:49.280 --> 00:51.680
..and it's got your DNA all over it.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.160
Birdy wasn't the first.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.560
You killed one of my officers right
in front of me!

00:58.560 --> 01:01.720
I think you'll be happy with what
you find in there.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.720
It's the rifle that killed Colin.

01:05.640 --> 01:06.920
Where's he?

01:06.920 --> 01:08.280
I don't know.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.920
That has to be the weapon Dardis
used.

01:11.920 --> 01:12.960
What?

01:12.960 --> 01:15.000
Birdy's car has been located, sir.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.080
No! Niamh, no, no, no!

01:20.760 --> 01:22.080
He might still be alive.

01:22.080 --> 01:26.080
I hope whoever did this is dead,
before I get to them.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.320
Where's my gold?

01:27.320 --> 01:28.760
I don't have it.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.320
No more time.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.800
Rob always said he could trust you.
Is that right?

01:36.080 --> 01:38.040
Me and Birdy, we've been seeing each
other.

01:38.040 --> 01:39.120
Why didn't you tell me?

01:39.120 --> 01:42.560
I need you to swear to me that you
will find Birdy.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.880
You think he was onto something?

01:44.880 --> 01:47.160
Then, it's our job to go and find
the bastard.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.880
He loves you and you will find him.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.840
If something's happened to Birdy,
I'll find who did it

01:58.840 --> 02:00.320
and I'll kill them.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.720
Where is it? The gun, the gold.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.880
I will do whatever you want.

02:06.880 --> 02:10.120
Then, you'll start by telling me
everything about that cop of yours.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.840
Well, he has a daughter.

02:41.880 --> 02:46.560
There is a farm attached to our
property. We own the land.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.520
You're looking for an old stone barn
with a red tin roof.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.280
Do we really have to do this?

03:41.280 --> 03:42.840
If we don't, we lose the house.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.720
Congratulations.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.680
I thought your offer would be
accepted.

03:48.680 --> 03:50.640
No doubt yous'll want to go out and
celebrate.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.840
OK, so, the house will be in your
name, Isabelle, is that right?

03:56.840 --> 03:58.400
Izzy.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.720
Grand.

03:59.720 --> 04:03.840
If you can just sign here and here,
confirm the agreed price,

04:03.840 --> 04:05.960
and we can get that over to the
solicitors.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.120
Thanking you.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.760
Oh, I didn't own my own house, until
I was well into my '30s.

04:12.760 --> 04:15.160
Thank God for the Bank of Daddy,
eh?

04:16.320 --> 04:17.480
Sorry...

04:18.920 --> 04:20.960
..do you need me for anything else?

04:20.960 --> 04:22.320
No.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.240
No, I can do the rest with your
dad.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.160
Sorry, did I say something?

04:32.160 --> 04:34.640
No, no, I'm sorry. She's not feeling
quite right.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.600
Poor wee thing. Today of all days.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.280
Oh, sod's law, eh? Mm-hm.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.880
Right, so, you're paying for this
with a mortgage

04:43.880 --> 04:46.400
and an authorised overdraft, is that
right? That's correct.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.720
Grand.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.280
Oh.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.400
There's quite hefty interest
payments on this overdraft here.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.440
I'll be grand.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.000
I'm, um...

04:56.000 --> 04:57.520
I'm coming into some money.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.560
Right.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.320
I'm sorry you had to go through
that but...

05:13.320 --> 05:15.240
..we can't stand still.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.440
I don't want you to kill anyone.

05:17.440 --> 05:18.960
What?

05:18.960 --> 05:20.760
I've been thinking about what you
said,

05:20.760 --> 05:23.640
about what you'd do to somebody
that...that would hurt Birdy,

05:23.640 --> 05:25.120
and I don't want that.

05:25.120 --> 05:28.240
And I know that you have a gun and I
know that you've used it before,

05:28.240 --> 05:29.520
but it shouldn't be easy.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.360
Izzy... I know that you would do it
for me. I know that.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.960
And I don't want you to.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.720
Will we go? Birdy wouldn't either.

05:37.120 --> 05:41.320
There's not a violent bone in that
boy's body.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.520
I know.

05:42.520 --> 05:45.360
I mean, what's he even doing in the
police?

05:45.360 --> 05:47.920
Is that what do you think of me?
Oh, my God, you know what I mean.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.320
Listen, the job is confrontational,

05:50.320 --> 05:53.280
you know, and we might see the worst
in people...

05:53.280 --> 05:55.720
..but, believe me that...

05:55.720 --> 05:58.680
..it's people like Birdy,

05:58.680 --> 06:02.240
like Niamh, Jackie even...

06:03.240 --> 06:04.520
..me...

06:06.880 --> 06:08.960
..we're just trying to make things
better.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.640
He's a natural investigator.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.240
That's why he's in the police.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.080
He's very good at it.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.520
I'll tell him you said that.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.120
Izzy.

06:48.280 --> 06:49.440
I love you.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.800
Where are you going, now?

06:58.160 --> 06:59.280
Back to work.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.560
That you done for the day, Noel?

07:23.640 --> 07:25.840
Pubs aren't open for another couple
of hours.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.480
I...I have to head to a meeting.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.840
Well, let's you and me have a wee
talk first.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.120
Did you give Olivia Foyle her
husband's will?

07:32.120 --> 07:33.320
Aye.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.480
I wasn't aware that probate had been
granted.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.320
No, well, it hasn't, yet.

07:37.320 --> 07:40.080
All right, But Colin Foyle's
children agreed to it?

07:40.080 --> 07:41.640
Aye.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.560
I wouldn't have expected that.

07:43.560 --> 07:47.000
Still, I'll...I'll give them a wee
call, iron this out.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.200
No, you don't need to do that.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.240
Why would that be?

07:51.760 --> 07:53.000
They don't know.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.240
So, how did she get you to break the
law?

07:57.240 --> 08:00.440
Listen, anything for an easy life,
you know.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.520
She's some piece of work. I just
wanted to get them off my case.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.320
Them? What?

08:05.320 --> 08:06.920
Who's "them"?

08:06.920 --> 08:09.520
No, I...I didn't mean that. Yes, you
did.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.160
This...this is what it looks like.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.760
Are you happy for us to put it out?

08:17.760 --> 08:19.880
You think it'll do any good?

08:19.880 --> 08:21.600
Honestly?

08:21.600 --> 08:23.480
No.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.440
But we're not left with many
options.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.920
Tom.

08:41.920 --> 08:43.560
Did you go and see Noel Timoney?

08:43.560 --> 08:46.720
I did. He confirmed the will. It's
genuine.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.560
Aye, but do we trust him?

08:48.560 --> 08:51.240
The man's been Colin Foyle's
solicitor for over a decade.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.920
He has to have known what was going
on. I agree.

08:53.920 --> 08:57.800
He said Olivia Foyle came to him to
ask him to provide the will

08:57.800 --> 09:01.080
but he seemed to suggest that she
wasn't on her own.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.400
What?

09:02.400 --> 09:04.080
It could've been a simple slip

09:04.080 --> 09:06.960
but he used the word "them" instead
of "her".

09:06.960 --> 09:09.640
So, she took AJ Boyd with her?

09:09.640 --> 09:12.600
I asked that and I checked on Boyd's
movements at the time.

09:12.600 --> 09:13.760
He was in court.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.320
I also asked about Robert Dardis,

09:15.320 --> 09:17.560
but Timoney insisted that it was a
slip of the tongue.

09:17.560 --> 09:20.400
He went to great lengths to stress
it was just her.

09:20.400 --> 09:23.480
Sounds like a man trying to cover up
a mistake. Mm.

09:23.480 --> 09:27.360
I've made sure we've got a copy of
the will. I'll go through it. OK.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.080
What are you doing, now?

09:29.080 --> 09:31.120
I'm headed to Birdy's house.

09:31.120 --> 09:34.080
We're conducting a search of the
property as a precaution.

09:35.680 --> 09:37.280
Grand.

09:37.280 --> 09:40.120
I'll pay a visit to Mrs Foyle.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.200
Maybe she'll reveal who her friend
is.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.040
She trusts you that much?

09:44.040 --> 09:45.800
Oh, he has ways of making her talk.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.400
Birdy didn't have a laptop or hard
drive here, no?

11:11.400 --> 11:12.680
Haven't seen one, Sarge.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.720
All right?

13:12.080 --> 13:13.960
Can I help you? Yes, you can.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.880
PIANO MUSIC PLAYS

13:23.840 --> 13:26.000
Where's my gold?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.720
I don't have it, yet.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.920
He hasn't brought it to me.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.560
He can't get away from work.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.640
I thought he was at your beck and
call.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.160
He is, but he's being careful.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.600
I appreciate careful...

13:44.600 --> 13:46.240
..but I have no time for caution.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.920
And the reason he can't get away
from his work,

13:50.920 --> 13:53.640
would it have anything to do with
you shooting one of his boys?

13:56.440 --> 13:58.840
The only reason you're not already
dead

13:58.840 --> 14:01.320
is because I prefer no-one knows I'm
here

14:01.320 --> 14:04.640
but that can change. I'll get you
your gold.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.160
Mm.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.160
What do you plan to do with him?

14:11.920 --> 14:14.840
People who don't get what they're
promised are seldom reasonable.

14:14.840 --> 14:17.480
I'll think of something. I'm afraid
that won't cut it.

14:17.480 --> 14:21.520
You see, I'd rather not have to
worry about an angry Irish cop.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.720
439, Broomfield Avenue, Brooklyn.
What?

14:38.160 --> 14:39.680
That's where your son lives, right?

14:39.680 --> 14:42.040
My associates say he's a very good
chef.

14:42.040 --> 14:45.920
And usually, they would not be the
kind of guys that would go for...

14:45.920 --> 14:47.960
What's that called?

14:47.960 --> 14:49.480
Fusion food?

14:49.480 --> 14:50.560
Please.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.080
They're more meat and potatoes, if
you know what I mean.

14:53.080 --> 14:54.480
Salty.

14:54.480 --> 14:57.840
But they're going there for lunch
again today, so...

14:57.840 --> 14:59.240
Leave him out of this.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.680
There's nothing to worry about,
Olivia.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.680
We've got each other's backs, don't
we?

15:10.800 --> 15:13.320
There's no loyalty like
incentivised loyalty.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.760
I think you have the wrong table.

15:46.760 --> 15:47.880
Who are you?

15:47.880 --> 15:50.320
Not your date, clearly.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.880
How do you know Olivia Foyle?

15:56.880 --> 15:58.480
Let's start again, shall we?

15:58.480 --> 16:00.040
"Hi. Do you mind if I sit down?"

16:00.040 --> 16:01.840
"Not at all.
Make yourself comfortable."

16:01.840 --> 16:05.480
"Thank you. That's kind.
My name is..."

16:05.480 --> 16:07.040
DCI Tom Brannick.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.240
Pleasure to meet you, Tom.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.600
Your ears must have been burning.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.480
My name is Ryan Savage.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.040
Savage.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.760
You're here from America.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.200
Is it that obvious?
Man, I thought I was blending in.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.080
And you're controlling
Olivia Foyle.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.600
Are you one of these detectives that
does all their thinking out loud?

16:30.680 --> 16:32.360
You've come for the gold.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.000
Yes, I have.
Have you brought it for me?

16:36.480 --> 16:37.840
What?

16:37.840 --> 16:39.240
You have it. Where is it?

16:40.800 --> 16:43.280
Says who?

16:43.280 --> 16:44.560
Do you have it or not?

16:48.280 --> 16:49.720
Not here.

16:51.320 --> 16:54.680
Answer me this, Tom. Are you and
the widow planning something?

16:54.680 --> 16:55.800
Like what?

16:55.800 --> 16:58.040
Do you still believe you can divide
the gold between you?

16:58.040 --> 17:00.120
Because it's not yours to divide.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.840
Does she have an agreement
with you?

17:04.840 --> 17:06.920
I'm not the only one who doesn't
trust her, then.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.680
Mmm. What's your agreement?

17:08.680 --> 17:10.160
Oh, we don't have one.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.920
She just understands what's
at stake.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.560
And what's that?

17:15.560 --> 17:18.800
The usual - life, limbs,

17:18.800 --> 17:22.240
and ze pursuit of a penis.

17:24.600 --> 17:26.440
Nah, I'm just kidding, of course.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.920
Nothing going on
between her and I.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.800
You, on the other hand.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.760
She's wild, isn't she?

17:35.120 --> 17:38.800
She's the kind of woman that would
use the shards of your broken heart
to cut your throat.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.120
I like her.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.320
Are you the jealous type, Tom?

17:44.320 --> 17:46.760
Is that why you followed her here?

17:46.760 --> 17:48.720
I just like to know who I'm...

17:50.680 --> 17:51.800
..I'm really dealing with.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.640
Oh, we don't have a deal.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.840
I'll tell you what to do,

17:54.840 --> 17:57.280
and you'll do it.
The same as Mrs Foyle.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.520
Is that right?

17:58.520 --> 17:59.720
It is.

17:59.720 --> 18:02.200
Because you're a dirty cop.

18:03.440 --> 18:06.160
And the last thing you want is for
people to find that out,

18:06.160 --> 18:09.560
so, you see, that puts me in an
advantageous position.

18:09.560 --> 18:10.680
I have the high ground.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.240
It makes you a clearer target.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.480
Right.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.160
I had hoped to stay in
the background, unseen,

18:36.160 --> 18:40.240
but now that you've announced
yourself like this,

18:40.240 --> 18:43.160
you should be in little doubt that
were things not to go my way,

18:43.160 --> 18:46.920
I will ruin your life, possibly with
death, whichever's more convenient.

18:51.280 --> 18:54.200
Now, this latest turn of events

18:54.200 --> 18:58.120
means I need to, um, move a little
faster, shall we say?

18:58.120 --> 19:02.560
So, how about you bring me
my gold tomorrow?

19:07.360 --> 19:08.920
I'm not bringing it here.

19:08.920 --> 19:12.120
Somewhere more private.
No chance of being interrupted.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.600
Just the two of us.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.920
You, me, and the widow makes three.

19:17.360 --> 19:20.840
Then we can talk through
any misunderstandings.

19:20.840 --> 19:22.080
There you go.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.800
Oh, tell me, do you give
the leftover food to the pigs?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.520
Because there's one right here
that doesn't look so good.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.120
HE CHUCKLES

19:37.520 --> 19:39.560
CARD MACHINE BEEPS

19:43.200 --> 19:45.240
MACHINE BEEPS, WHIRS

19:48.240 --> 19:50.440
That's all gone through for you
there, Mr Brooks.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.880
Thank you very much.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.600
No, thank you.

19:56.480 --> 19:57.840
How exciting.

20:01.880 --> 20:05.600
I've had Boston cops in my
pocket before.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.840
Never a small-town Irish one.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.720
Maybe you can be my lucky charm.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.200
Why didn't you tell me?

20:25.200 --> 20:27.320
Because I thought I could handle him
on my own.

20:27.320 --> 20:30.040
That's why you took my gun?
To kill Savage and frame me?

20:30.040 --> 20:31.640
No, I took that to protect myself.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.720
He is under the impression that
I have his gold.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.680
Yeah, because I needed more time.
Time for what?

20:35.680 --> 20:37.480
To figure out what the hell
to do with him.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.760
So you put me in the crosshairs?

20:38.760 --> 20:42.640
Oh, Tom, he's already after
both of us.

20:42.640 --> 20:45.360
I could have told him the truth.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.280
But you didn't.

20:47.280 --> 20:51.040
Because you know neither of us get
the gold if he gets what he wants.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.320
SHE SIGHS

21:03.040 --> 21:04.920
Is he travelling alone?

21:04.920 --> 21:06.400
I believe so, yeah.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.880
Why?

21:10.880 --> 21:14.920
I want half the gold.
I want you to agree to that.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.880
I'm agreeing to nothing
without knowing your intentions.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.200
I'll frame him for Birdy's murder.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.120
He'll get tried or extradited,

21:31.120 --> 21:32.920
and we'll be free to split
the gold.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.200
How will you do that?

21:34.200 --> 21:35.840
Half. Say it.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.440
Course. Olivia!

21:39.200 --> 21:43.240
If you can do that, I will give you
half the gold. It's a deal.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.800
I need the pistol you used
to kill Birdy.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.480
Nuh-uh.
Do you want rid of him or not?

21:51.480 --> 21:55.360
I do. Well, then, the pistol.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.560
No.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.920
Not until I know you've got
a good enough plan.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.600
PHONE BUZZES

22:06.520 --> 22:07.680
Yes?

22:07.680 --> 22:09.200
Your cop was following you.

22:09.200 --> 22:10.640
I've just found that out.

22:10.640 --> 22:11.800
I don't like that.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.160
Then kill him.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.560
CALL ENDED TONE

22:19.520 --> 22:21.400
Just through here. Yeah.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.080
All right. Just wait here
a moment, OK?

22:26.080 --> 22:27.960
Aye, no bother. On you go.

22:41.880 --> 22:44.760
So is there a reward or something?

22:44.760 --> 22:45.960
No.

22:47.440 --> 22:48.920
Are you sure?

22:50.880 --> 22:54.600
Er, we don't give money
for information from the public.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.600
What about £100?

22:56.600 --> 22:58.760
Did you not hear what I just said?

22:58.760 --> 22:59.920
But I'm skint.

22:59.920 --> 23:03.080
You're an untested source
with uncorroborated information.

23:05.120 --> 23:08.160
I... I don't know what that means.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.360
You're a firefighter.
You think we have money?

23:12.240 --> 23:17.960
Either you want to hear
what I have to say about this fella
or you don't.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.760
£40?

23:24.760 --> 23:26.000
Aye, that'll do.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.680
Are you sure it was him?

23:29.680 --> 23:31.760
Oh, aye. I never forget a face.

23:33.160 --> 23:34.680
Explain what happened.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.240
I was driving home from work.

23:39.240 --> 23:43.480
It was maybe 11:30 at night.

23:43.480 --> 23:48.200
I stopped at the traffic lights
and a car pulls up beside me.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.520
I look over, as you do,

23:49.520 --> 23:53.360
and I see this fella
looking back at me.

23:53.360 --> 23:57.360
And he looked really concerned,
like dead serious.

23:57.360 --> 23:58.800
And I recognised him.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.200
You recognised him from where?

24:02.200 --> 24:04.880
Er, I go clubbing with my friends.

24:04.880 --> 24:08.720
We go to this one place, Angels.
It's in the town.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.440
And we used to go every
Thursday night.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.280
It was like a pound a shot.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.640
And this fella worked the doors.

24:16.240 --> 24:19.360
He's probably the only bouncer
who wasn't a complete smick.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.440
He even tried it on with our
Jeannie, so he did.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.480
And did he recognise you
at the traffic lights?

24:28.480 --> 24:31.400
Um...no, I don't think so.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.760
I smiled, like, but he was away
with the fairies.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.680
Was he driving?

24:36.680 --> 24:39.480
No, he was on the passenger side.

24:39.480 --> 24:40.960
Did you see who was driving?

24:44.640 --> 24:46.120
Am I going to see that £40?

24:59.320 --> 25:02.400
We've had about a dozen reported
sightings of him around the country,

25:02.400 --> 25:04.880
but this feels like
the first credible lead.

25:04.880 --> 25:08.040
She brought up the club he works
at without prompting.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.400
Did she remember anything useful?

25:10.400 --> 25:11.640
She didn't see the driver.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.800
She doesn't remember anything
specific about the car,

25:13.800 --> 25:16.600
just that it was big and dark.
Mm-hm.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.200
So £40 well spent.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.000
Well, she does remember
the road she was on

25:20.000 --> 25:22.640
and the junction she was at where
she saw him.

25:22.640 --> 25:24.720
Any camera footage to back that up?

25:24.720 --> 25:26.680
I've requested it, aye.

25:26.680 --> 25:28.360
Hmm. Tom!

25:31.880 --> 25:34.160
Any luck with Olivia Foyle?

25:34.160 --> 25:35.680
I didn't get to talk to her.

25:35.680 --> 25:39.040
I tailed her as she left her house.
She was driving her own car.

25:39.040 --> 25:40.400
She has a driving ban.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.560
Well, I wasn't going to pick her up
on a traffic offence,

25:42.560 --> 25:44.480
not when she looked to be making
a move.

25:44.480 --> 25:45.760
And was she?

25:45.760 --> 25:47.400
It's hard to say.

25:47.400 --> 25:49.360
I followed her to
the Glencorrie Hotel.

25:49.360 --> 25:52.680
She was in there 20 minutes,
and then she drove home.

25:52.680 --> 25:55.720
Well, let's get a list of everyone
staying at that hotel.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.040
Sir. Sir.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.440
Did you find anything at Birdy's?

26:01.440 --> 26:02.760
No.

26:02.760 --> 26:05.040
We do have an eyewitness
who saw Dardis

26:05.040 --> 26:07.360
the night he went missing
from the safe house.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.280
Are you sure?

26:10.280 --> 26:13.920
I think so.
I've yet to confirm on any cameras.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.360
Who's the witness?

26:15.360 --> 26:18.200
Sadie McIntyre.

26:18.200 --> 26:19.600
Where did she see him?

26:19.600 --> 26:23.360
The Dunfolan Road.
He was the passenger in a car.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.480
Could she ID the driver?

26:25.480 --> 26:26.720
No.

27:10.400 --> 27:13.160
Hello, this is DCI Brannick
for the ANPR team, please.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.920
Hello, who's that?

27:17.800 --> 27:19.920
INAUDIBLE

27:19.920 --> 27:23.760
Hi there, Sergeant. This is
DCI Brannick down at Dunfolan.

27:23.760 --> 27:27.640
Aye. Um, you've had a request
for any traffic camera footage

27:27.640 --> 27:31.520
from the Dunfolan Road on
the night of February 13th?

27:31.520 --> 27:33.200
That's right.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.920
Er, it's part of
another investigation,

27:35.920 --> 27:37.880
so you need to make sure you send
all the findings

27:37.880 --> 27:39.560
to me only, please, as the SIO.

27:41.040 --> 27:42.920
Indeed. Thank you.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.120
HE PANTS

28:09.160 --> 28:11.200
PHONE RINGS

28:23.600 --> 28:25.760
KNOCKING ON DOOR

28:25.760 --> 28:28.800
My doorbell works, you know.
You don't have to call me.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.120
Oh.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.120
Find anyone of interest?

28:43.320 --> 28:45.880
None that I can see.

28:45.880 --> 28:48.280
The hotel says this is everyone.

28:48.280 --> 28:52.920
Maybe check them against Colin
Foyle's client list, just in case.

28:52.920 --> 28:54.680
Aye.

28:54.680 --> 28:56.280
What have you got?

28:56.280 --> 28:58.280
It's the wording
of Colin Foyle's will.

28:58.280 --> 29:02.440
It talks about the house, of course,
but says it was bought in two lots.

29:02.440 --> 29:05.520
The land around it was sold
separately from the house itself.

29:05.520 --> 29:06.760
Look at this.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.040
125 acres?

29:12.080 --> 29:13.920
Jesus.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.720
Why didn't we know about
that before?

29:15.720 --> 29:18.920
It was on a long lease to a local
farmer. It's only just become
available again.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.600
So it's not currently being used?

29:20.600 --> 29:22.800
No.

29:22.800 --> 29:25.840
You think there's buildings there we
haven't searched?

29:25.840 --> 29:29.360
Well, you'd have to think
it wouldn't be short on places
to hide gold.

29:29.360 --> 29:32.640
I'll get the land information
from the agent who sold it.

29:32.640 --> 29:36.400
We can look at satellite imagery.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.000
Great.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.880
What are you doing here?

30:07.880 --> 30:09.680
It's Ryan Savage.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.680
VOICE BREAKS: He's got
your daughter.

30:11.680 --> 30:12.800
No.

30:12.800 --> 30:15.480
He just called and told me.
How did he know about her?

30:15.480 --> 30:17.320
Well, I don't know.

30:17.320 --> 30:20.480
You're lying. No, I swear.
It's the same with my son.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.800
He just has this way of finding out.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.920
I'm so sorry, Tom.

30:59.480 --> 31:00.920
Do you have the gold?

31:00.920 --> 31:02.280
Yes. Do you have the pistol?

31:02.280 --> 31:03.880
Yeah. Show me. OK.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.680
Let's take it inside. Why?

31:14.680 --> 31:16.200
Change of plan.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.280
I'm going to need that pistol
off you now.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.440
You're not going to plant
the gun on him now, are you?

31:32.440 --> 31:33.560
No.

31:33.560 --> 31:37.480
Well, whatever you're thinking,
he's got your daughter.

31:37.480 --> 31:38.840
He's going to be ready for you.

31:38.840 --> 31:40.920
There's no way you're getting near
him with a gun.

31:40.920 --> 31:42.920
I'm a police officer.
I'm supposed to be armed.

31:42.920 --> 31:46.360
Yeah, and he knows that.
And he'll make you get rid of it.

31:46.360 --> 31:49.080
So I've come up
with something else.

31:49.080 --> 31:50.440
And what is that?

31:50.440 --> 31:53.320
Are you telling me the truth,
Olivia? Are we in this together?

31:54.800 --> 31:58.200
This isn't about you and me, Tom.
This is about the gold.

33:55.480 --> 33:57.040
Judith, where's the DCI?

33:57.040 --> 33:58.680
I haven't seen him yet, Sarge.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.120
KNOCK ON DOOR

34:20.600 --> 34:23.120
Yeah?

34:23.120 --> 34:25.440
Sir.

34:25.440 --> 34:28.720
The DCI put me on to something
in the Foyle will.

34:28.720 --> 34:32.160
Colin Foyle owned more farmland
around the house than we knew about.

34:32.160 --> 34:35.880
I just found a barn on it that we
haven't searched yet.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.920
You think there could be something
out there?

34:37.920 --> 34:40.520
I think it's worth applying
for a further warrant.

34:47.160 --> 34:49.200
GULLS CALL

35:06.920 --> 35:08.960
Nearly there.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.960
MUFFLED SPEECH

35:08.960 --> 35:11.760
And I wanted to make sure you're
still alive,

35:11.760 --> 35:14.080
which is good that you are.

35:14.080 --> 35:15.560
Deep breaths.

35:15.560 --> 35:19.120
In through the nose
and out through the nose.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.000
Your dad's a dirty cop.
You know that?

35:32.480 --> 35:34.760
He's been sleeping with this woman.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.840
Not step-mother material,
I'm afraid.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.520
She killed one of his officers.

35:38.520 --> 35:40.960
SHE MOANS

35:40.960 --> 35:42.760
And together, they've been trying

35:42.760 --> 35:46.680
to divest her dead husband
of some gold. My gold.

35:46.680 --> 35:49.840
And now you and I are going to
collect it.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.200
You see?

35:53.760 --> 35:55.800
MUFFLED SOBS

35:53.760 --> 35:55.800
I know.

35:57.160 --> 36:00.440
We grow up thinking our fathers
are giants,

36:00.440 --> 36:03.400
and then it's just one
hidden secret,

36:03.400 --> 36:06.920
one pathetic excuse away
from them shrinking to nothing.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.600
I'm telling you the truth.

36:12.600 --> 36:17.040
Come on, don't tell me he hasn't
been dreaming big recently.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.720
Spending money he doesn't have?

36:20.760 --> 36:22.280
There it is.

36:25.520 --> 36:28.040
SHE GRUNTS, SOBS

36:28.040 --> 36:30.200
Today's going to be tough
for you, sweetheart.

37:35.320 --> 37:38.000
Hi, this is Tom Brannick. Leave
a message and I'll get back to you.

37:40.960 --> 37:44.000
Belfast have just come through
with a missing person's case.

37:44.000 --> 37:49.360
Someone we apparently spoke to last
week, a Davy Sinclair.

37:49.360 --> 37:52.880
His housemates say he's gone for 48
hours, no sign of him anywhere.

37:52.880 --> 37:55.800
He's the one who connected
Rob Dardis to Olivia Foyle.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.400
Works at Angels nightclub.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.200
I see.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.360
Right, let's get her in.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.440
SEA BIRDS CALL

38:37.480 --> 38:39.640

38:51.000 --> 38:53.160
Sir, uniform went to
the Foyle house,

38:53.160 --> 38:54.840
but they said
there was no-one there.

38:54.840 --> 38:58.160
I've spoken to AJ Boyd, but he said
he hasn't heard from her either.

39:00.520 --> 39:01.840
Where's Tom?

39:02.880 --> 39:05.080
I still don't know, sir.

39:05.080 --> 39:07.200
Get a search on his phone
and his radio.

39:09.920 --> 39:12.480
PHONE RINGS

39:12.480 --> 39:14.320
Yeah?

39:14.320 --> 39:16.520
Oh, Niamh?

39:16.520 --> 39:18.040
Great, thanks.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.360
The warrant has come through

39:21.360 --> 39:23.640
to search the barn on the Foyle
property. I'll come with you.

39:25.320 --> 39:28.840
Could you get a search on
DCI Brannick's phone and radio?

39:28.840 --> 39:30.480
Right, let's go.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.080
No-one here.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.640
Not the time of year for a holiday.

39:56.640 --> 39:57.920
Tom.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.640
Olivia. Tom.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.120
Where's my daughter?

40:43.840 --> 40:45.880
MUFFLED WHIMPER

40:53.080 --> 40:54.360
Nuh-uh, stay back.

40:57.400 --> 40:59.160
Ditch the gun.

41:04.600 --> 41:07.280
Slowly.

41:07.280 --> 41:10.160
Now put it on the ground
in front of you.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.600
Kick it away.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.240
SHE EXHALES

41:25.320 --> 41:28.160
My people don't hear from me
in 20 minutes, your son dies.

41:29.560 --> 41:31.240
You motherfu... Olivia.

41:33.080 --> 41:35.000
Where's the gold?

41:35.000 --> 41:37.400
It's in the car. I'll show you.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.440
No, you won't. Go get it.

41:45.560 --> 41:47.920
I need your word
you won't harm my daughter.

41:49.320 --> 41:52.000
You give me my gold,
I give her to you.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.120
Your word.

41:53.120 --> 41:56.240
My word's not worth shit, Tom.
You should know that.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.720
I won't ask again.

41:59.080 --> 42:01.120
SHE WHIMPERS

41:59.080 --> 42:01.120
No.

42:04.960 --> 42:06.600
Come on, Tom.

42:15.640 --> 42:17.680
HE BREATHES RAPIDLY

42:19.640 --> 42:22.800
Hey. Let's give the man his gold,

42:22.800 --> 42:26.000
get your daughter,
and save my son, OK?

42:28.120 --> 42:30.440
Yeah. Yeah. Hold on, hold on.

42:30.440 --> 42:33.680
Olivia Foyle met with a guest
at the Glencorrie Hotel.

42:33.680 --> 42:37.200
He checked out this morning.
An American.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.680
I think he's here for the gold.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.120
Sergeant, yeah, I'm still here.

42:42.120 --> 42:43.920
We have to treat this man
as a suspect

42:43.920 --> 42:46.120
in the disappearance
of DC William Bird.

43:00.280 --> 43:03.160
There. You have your gold.

43:22.760 --> 43:24.400
Open the bags.

43:35.800 --> 43:37.480
This one first.

43:58.280 --> 44:00.160
Show me.

44:09.520 --> 44:11.200
What were you expecting, Ryan?

44:13.440 --> 44:14.920
Now give me my daughter.

44:18.200 --> 44:19.760
The others.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.600
She's all yours.

45:06.160 --> 45:07.680
Come here, love.

45:09.920 --> 45:11.320
Come here.

45:20.640 --> 45:22.680

45:54.720 --> 45:56.120
Argh, come on!

46:07.200 --> 46:08.920
How do I disarm the bags?

46:10.960 --> 46:13.000
IZZY BREATHES SHAKILY

47:34.240 --> 47:35.800
There.

47:46.080 --> 47:49.120
Oh, Christ. Oh, Birdy.

47:56.280 --> 47:58.000
I am so sorry, young man.

48:30.200 --> 48:32.520
She fucking left him for the rats.

48:45.920 --> 48:47.960
SHE INHALES DEEPLY

49:08.560 --> 49:10.040
That's it.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.760
GUNSHOT

49:22.480 --> 49:24.160
Olivia, don't do this.

49:24.160 --> 49:26.000
HE GRUNTS

49:26.000 --> 49:27.520
I don't need you any more, Tom.

49:29.160 --> 49:32.120
Ryan's gone. My name is cleared.

49:33.480 --> 49:36.160
And alive you'll only come looking
for me. Don't.

49:36.160 --> 49:38.440

49:36.160 --> 49:38.440

50:00.320 --> 50:01.880
It's there.

50:04.920 --> 50:06.520
No, the other one.

50:06.520 --> 50:07.880
Thanks.

50:25.320 --> 50:27.440
HE GRUNTS, MOANS

50:28.560 --> 50:30.040
Izzy.

50:32.520 --> 50:34.560
You knew Birdy was dead.

50:34.560 --> 50:36.400
Were you there?

50:36.400 --> 50:38.640
Were you?

50:38.640 --> 50:40.680
HE GRUNTS

50:38.640 --> 50:40.680
Yes.

50:42.920 --> 50:44.680
And did you help her do it?

50:44.680 --> 50:46.360
No. No, I...

50:48.520 --> 50:50.000
I was sat beside him.

50:51.320 --> 50:52.880
I was talking to him.

50:54.360 --> 50:56.160
But you and her are close?

50:58.360 --> 51:00.040
She was going to kill me.

51:03.240 --> 51:05.040
Who are you? What?

51:06.280 --> 51:07.520
I don't know you.

51:07.520 --> 51:09.280
Yes, you do.

51:09.280 --> 51:11.600
It's me, Izzy. It's me.

51:39.440 --> 51:42.480
Hi, this is Tom Brannick. Leave
a message and I'll get back to you.

51:42.480 --> 51:44.520
SHE SIGHS

52:05.080 --> 52:06.920

52:06.920 --> 52:11.440
..all of this, the reason we're
here like this...

52:12.720 --> 52:16.360
..it's about the gold.
It's for you, Izzy.

52:17.680 --> 52:20.000
It's yours. Take it.

52:22.480 --> 52:23.800
It's yours.

52:25.760 --> 52:27.560
I don't want it.

52:27.560 --> 52:29.480
You have to. No.

52:29.480 --> 52:31.400
I don't want that.

52:31.400 --> 52:34.080
But I protected it
all this time for you.

52:36.280 --> 52:38.040
You've killed someone now.

52:39.760 --> 52:41.680
What are you going to do
about that?

52:50.440 --> 52:52.480
HE MOUTHS

53:22.160 --> 53:24.640

53:30.760 --> 53:33.560

53:37.360 --> 53:40.280
Tell them what I've done,
that it was all me.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.280
Fuck.

54:25.040 --> 54:28.880
7.3 miles south-east

54:28.880 --> 54:33.160
Closest available units are six
- that is six - minutes away.

54:33.160 --> 54:35.600
Do you require
Uniform assistance, over?

54:40.440 --> 54:43.720
Sierra Romeo 4-5, should units
approach DCI Brannick, over?

54:46.520 --> 54:49.040
We can put the gold in the car.

54:49.040 --> 54:52.400
You can be gone
before they get here, huh?

54:55.720 --> 54:57.760
