00:06.673 --> 00:08.231
Spacecataz.

00:08.274 --> 00:10.708
We know you eat your own farts.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.507
Um, they're writing it
on our ship.

00:12.545 --> 00:13.807
You see that, right?

00:13.847 --> 00:17.283
They shouldn't do that,
but they are filled with shame.

00:17.317 --> 00:19.581
Admission is the first step
in recovery.

00:19.619 --> 00:21.211
Yeah, but they're
making it look like...

00:21.254 --> 00:23.085
you know,
like we like to do that.

00:23.123 --> 00:24.420
Ha ha ha ha!

00:24.457 --> 00:25.947
They... no!

00:25.992 --> 00:27.789
We do not eat our own farts!

00:27.827 --> 00:31.319
Well, then why did you paint
that on the side of your ship...

00:31.364 --> 00:33.264
unless you long to consume
your own farts?

00:33.299 --> 00:35.529
- It's so pathetic.
- Eww, that's... gross.

00:35.568 --> 00:36.694
What kind of a creature
gets nutrition...

00:36.736 --> 00:38.203
from its own farts, Err?

00:38.238 --> 00:39.398
They do, man.

00:39.439 --> 00:41.168
That's absolutely correct.

00:42.308 --> 00:44.469
F- A-R-T-S.

00:44.511 --> 00:45.842
That's all!

00:45.879 --> 00:49.280
Let's just cut our losses
and walk away.

00:49.315 --> 00:53.513
<i>Nein! The time for maturity
is over!</i>

00:56.222 --> 00:58.713
Yes, I would like
to order a million...

00:58.758 --> 01:03.058
no, hold on.
Fifty million large pizzas.

01:03.096 --> 01:06.691
<i>My name is Shake-Zula</i>

01:06.733 --> 01:08.792
<i>The mike ruler,
the old-schooler</i>

01:08.835 --> 01:10.996
<i>You want to trip,
I'll bring it to ya</i>

01:11.037 --> 01:14.234
<i>Frylock and I'm on top,
rock you like a cop</i>

01:14.274 --> 01:16.902
<i>Meatwad, you're up next
with your knock-knock</i>

01:16.943 --> 01:19.275
<i>Meatwad make the money, see</i>

01:19.312 --> 01:21.746
<i>Meatwad get the honeys, G</i>

01:21.781 --> 01:24.341
<i>Drivin' in my car,

01:24.384 --> 01:26.181

<i>'Cause we are the Aqua Teens</i>

01:32.325 --> 01:35.988

<i>Number one in the hood, G</i>

01:48.208 --> 01:51.666
Ooh. Oh, hey, Carl.
How's it going?

01:51.711 --> 01:54.236
- Hey what?
- I'm just power walking.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.111
What are you
friggin' doing that for?

01:56.149 --> 01:57.207
You're just gonna die.

01:57.250 --> 02:00.344
Well, yeah, I know, but I need
to drop a couple pounds.

02:00.386 --> 02:02.786
My feet so fat I can't get
into my roller skates...

02:02.822 --> 02:04.414
and my neckerchief
don't fit anymore.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.788
Look at this.

02:05.825 --> 02:08.089
Uhh, uhh. It's a stickup.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.152
It don't work.
I do this at a bank robbery...

02:10.196 --> 02:11.857
I'll look like a fool.

02:11.898 --> 02:13.195
All right. The running man.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.723
Oh, no, no, no.
I power walk.

02:14.767 --> 02:17.395
Son of a...
look at this.

02:17.437 --> 02:18.734
How far did you run, Meatwad?

02:18.771 --> 02:21.797
I power walked down to that pile
of gummi bears and back.

02:21.841 --> 02:23.672
I should probably set
the pile out further...

02:23.710 --> 02:25.644
or closer,
so I can get at 'em.

02:25.678 --> 02:27.578
Maybe you shouldn't eat the
gummi bears once you reach them.

02:27.614 --> 02:28.842
But it's a halfway point.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.247
If you don't put
the gummi bears out...

02:30.283 --> 02:31.511
there ain't no reason to run...

02:31.551 --> 02:33.883
or power walk,
which is what I do.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.150
Well, I don't know why
you waste your time exercising.

02:36.189 --> 02:38.714
It's just sweat you're
gonna have to wash off.

02:38.758 --> 02:41.192
Exercising's for dummies
and women.

02:41.227 --> 02:42.922
Yeah, man.
You ought to hop on my diet.

02:42.962 --> 02:44.224
Started it two days ago...

02:44.264 --> 02:46.596
and, uh,
I'm already at my target weight.

02:46.633 --> 02:47.759
Which is?

02:47.800 --> 02:50.268
South Bronx Paradise Diet, baby!

02:50.303 --> 02:53.329
Yeah. The twist is,
you eat more than you want...

02:53.373 --> 02:57.241
and then you supplement that
with a special candy bar...

02:57.277 --> 02:59.939
and it ain't like them
sissy no-crabs diets, either.

02:59.979 --> 03:01.947
Uh, I think that's
no carbs, Carl.

03:01.981 --> 03:05.348
See, but I have crabs,
so I don't qualify for that.

03:05.385 --> 03:06.477
Have I told you that before?

03:06.519 --> 03:07.577
- Yeah.
- Funny story.

03:07.620 --> 03:10.748
Well, I don't have to
watch what I eat, or what I do.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.257
Call me Mr. Untouchable.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.886
Yeah, and that's why you're
a candidate for heart disease.

03:14.928 --> 03:18.455
Well...
I have three hearts...

03:18.498 --> 03:21.934
because I'm from Tatooine,
and my mother...

03:21.968 --> 03:23.731
- No, you're not.
- Really.

03:23.770 --> 03:25.601
Interesting.
'Cause, you know...

03:25.638 --> 03:28.300
I get my physical
every year on Alderaan.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.569
That didn't happen.

03:29.609 --> 03:32.134
Well... I'm...

03:32.178 --> 03:34.169
I am from the Dagobah system.

03:34.214 --> 03:38.173
All right, ladies, sorry to
break up the tea party...

03:38.218 --> 03:40.948
but it's time for
my afternoon candy bar.

03:40.987 --> 03:42.386
And you ain't got
to run or nothin'?

03:42.422 --> 03:43.719
- Nope.
- I want to do his diet.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.815
Meatwad, you should lose weight
the right way...

03:45.858 --> 03:47.985
by eating a well-balanced meal
and exercise.

03:48.027 --> 03:49.654
Or lose it the fun way...

03:49.696 --> 03:52.164
eat these candy bars
and sit on your ass...

03:52.198 --> 03:53.688
as it gets thinner and thinner.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.860
Or do it my way...
don't do it.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.564
What's that, R2?

03:58.671 --> 04:00.639
With no pants?
Did you all hear that?

04:00.673 --> 04:02.607
Ha ha ha! He's crazy.

04:02.642 --> 04:03.870
All right, Carl,
I'll tell you what.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.606
I'll bet you a case
of your favorite beer...

04:06.646 --> 04:08.079
that Meatwad loses
more weight than you...

04:08.114 --> 04:09.240
doing it the healthy way.

04:09.282 --> 04:10.647
Yeah. You're on.

04:10.683 --> 04:13.174
And if I win,
both of y'all get together...

04:13.219 --> 04:16.985
buy me a motorcycle
and a pink iPod mini.

04:17.023 --> 04:18.047
- No.
- No.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.250
All I want is
some home electronics.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.351
He gets to go to
the damn Dagobah system.

04:22.795 --> 04:24.888
Oh, R2. Ha ha ha ha!

04:24.931 --> 04:26.262
- Uhh!
- Come on, baby.

04:26.299 --> 04:28.290
Come on, come on, come on.
Lift it up.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.495
Come on. I know you can do it.
Come on. I know it's in you.

04:30.536 --> 04:31.833
I know you got it in you, baby.

04:31.871 --> 04:34.237
Uhh! One.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.742
All right, Meatwad,
that was good. That was great.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.267
- Now I want you to go for two.
- This is too hard.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.246
I know you can do it. Come on!

04:41.281 --> 04:44.808
You must be out of your mind.
I'm going back down to pink.

04:44.851 --> 04:47.911
See? Now, pink is challenging
and macho...

04:47.954 --> 04:49.888
and I'm feeling the burn
with this.

04:49.922 --> 04:53.187
Mmm, mmm! Hey... wow.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.524
Hey, you guys
want any of this popcorn...

04:55.561 --> 04:57.119
before the movie starts?

04:57.163 --> 04:58.790
- Popcorn!
- Boy, is it good.

04:58.898 --> 05:00.195
Over here, please.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.428
Well, there's none left.
Only two tubs survived...

05:02.468 --> 05:03.958
from the Force.

05:04.003 --> 05:05.061
Shake, you know
he can't eat that.

05:05.104 --> 05:07.299
Come on. I know.
He's got willpower.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.205
He will not not eat it.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.334
What movie we watching?

05:10.376 --> 05:12.105
No, Meatwad. Look,
we got to do thirty minutes...

05:12.145 --> 05:13.169
on the stair-stepper.

05:13.212 --> 05:15.271
- Son of a...
- Come on. It'll be fun.

05:15.315 --> 05:19.308
And then... and then I'm gonna
go off and get surgery...

05:19.352 --> 05:20.751
while you ain't looking...

05:20.787 --> 05:24.314
and get them to suck all
the rest of it out with a tube.

05:24.357 --> 05:25.688
Is that OK?

05:25.725 --> 05:27.989
Come on, now. All you got
is five more minutes.

05:28.027 --> 05:29.324
You can do this.

05:29.362 --> 05:31.489
But I want lips
like a tomb raider.

05:31.531 --> 05:34.796
I got nothing. Flat lips.
They ain't sultry.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.928
Funnel cakes!
Get your hot funnel cakes here!

05:37.970 --> 05:39.062
Funnel cakes!

05:39.105 --> 05:41.596
Funnel cakes
from the tomb raider!

05:41.641 --> 05:43.700
Do you have to fry
those here, Shake?

05:43.743 --> 05:44.937
Yeah, I do.

05:46.412 --> 05:48.880
Who's ready? Someone must be
ready for a funnel cake.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.405
I wish I could find someone.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.008
Shake, what's wrong with you?

05:52.051 --> 05:53.518
You know he can't have
this stuff.

05:53.553 --> 05:55.418
I don't know. I'm conflicted.

05:55.455 --> 05:57.013
Part of me wants
to show it to him...

05:57.056 --> 05:58.421
and then wolf it down
in front of him...

05:58.458 --> 06:02.394
and yet part of me wants to
see him eat it and lose the bet.

06:02.428 --> 06:04.419
I just don't know
who to trust anymore.

06:04.464 --> 06:05.556
All right, look.

06:05.598 --> 06:07.361
Can you just hit me with
some batter from there?

06:07.400 --> 06:10.130
Hey, batter, batter, batter,
sa-wing, batter!

06:10.169 --> 06:11.534
No, Meatwad, no batter.

06:11.571 --> 06:14.267
Look, I've already got
your dinner specially prepared.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.901
Mmm. This here's a good steak.

06:16.943 --> 06:19.309
A little chewy, but it will do.

06:19.345 --> 06:21.506
Well, because the steak
is a cat toy.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.038
But I don't know why a cat
would play with a steak...

06:24.083 --> 06:25.607
but I just put it in there
to get you excited...

06:25.651 --> 06:28.518
about your real dinner,
this celery stalk right here.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.351
Well, it ain't working.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.153
Now, if you expect me
to eat this...

06:32.191 --> 06:34.489
you gonna have to supply me
with some wing sauce.

06:34.527 --> 06:35.687
How about a twist of lemon?

06:35.728 --> 06:38.663
How about a twist of I gouge
your mother... eyes out?

06:38.698 --> 06:40.632
Get me the... damn wing sauce.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.964
Can I make that
à la mode for you?

06:43.002 --> 06:44.026
Yes, two scoops, please.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.402
All right. two.
Come on, four. Eight.

06:46.439 --> 06:48.339
Dream big! Be somebody!

06:48.374 --> 06:50.740
- Shake, get out of here.
- I'm not doing anything!

06:50.777 --> 06:52.472
He's not.
I'm tired of this diet.

06:52.512 --> 06:55.106
Can't eat what I want.
What's the point of living?

06:55.148 --> 06:56.740
There isn't any.
Hold my gun for me, will you?

06:56.783 --> 06:58.216
I said, get out of here.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.943
Carlos!

07:00.987 --> 07:02.477
Good afternoon, there, ladies.

07:02.522 --> 07:04.820
Whoa! You're looking
pretty skinny there, dude!

07:04.857 --> 07:07.724
How about you, uh, hook me up
with a couple funnel cakes?

07:07.760 --> 07:09.022
You got it, sticks.

07:09.061 --> 07:11.495
And, uh, go way heavy
on the powdered sugar.

07:11.531 --> 07:13.158
Man, you're looking pretty good.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.064
Yeah, what'd I tell you, man?

07:15.101 --> 07:17.934
South Bronx Paradise
all the way, baby.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.164
Ha ha ha ha, yeah.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.605
All I gotta eat are
these candy bars...

07:21.641 --> 07:23.040
get plenty of sleep...

07:23.075 --> 07:25.373
and no exercise, though.
That's a no-no.

07:25.411 --> 07:26.673
Technically,
I should've driven over here.

07:26.712 --> 07:27.838
You don't mind
if I take a look...

07:27.880 --> 07:29.279
at one of those
candy bars, do you?

07:29.315 --> 07:31.340
Yeah, they're $8 apiece there,
Fry Man...

07:31.384 --> 07:33.614
<i>so, uh... you liik.</i>

07:33.653 --> 07:36.121
Hey, can I just have
one funnel cake...

07:36.155 --> 07:38.646
- eating contest?
- Yeah.

07:38.691 --> 07:40.420
Pile 'em up right here
and get the clock.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.189
We'll throw down right now,
'cause I'm gonna...

07:42.228 --> 07:44.492
I'm gonna whup your ass
on this diet, boy.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.827
You're not part of the bet.

07:45.865 --> 07:48.129
Oh, OK! Sorry!

07:48.167 --> 07:49.600
Then I'm part of the bet.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.626
You heard him. I'm in it.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.730
Well... me running.

Say, Carl, do you have any idea
what's in these candy bars?

08:06.052 --> 08:07.679
No, I do not.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.585
Well, would you like to look
through this scope...

08:09.622 --> 08:11.180
and just see
what you've been eating?

08:11.224 --> 08:14.421
No. It's South Bronx
Paradise, baby!

08:14.460 --> 08:16.621
<i>- It's South Bronx Parasite.
- Yeah, whatever.</i>

08:16.662 --> 08:18.994
- Did you even read the wrapper?
- That's typical liberal media...

08:19.031 --> 08:20.293
Parasite, Paradise.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.700
You're guaranteed to shed pounds
within hours. I know that.

08:23.736 --> 08:25.101
Yeah, because there's
larvae inside of you...

08:25.137 --> 08:26.331
feeding on your flesh.

08:26.372 --> 08:28.306
What am I, nerd scientist here?

08:28.341 --> 08:31.242
Hey, look, save the dissertation
for my ass...

08:31.277 --> 08:33.006
before it totally disappears.

08:33.044 --> 08:36.014
Ha ha ha ha ha!
South Bronx Paradise!

08:36.048 --> 08:40.041
Hey, Carl, you left this.
Coming out your butt.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.748
Yeah, I thought I felt
something sort of slip.

08:42.788 --> 08:45.313
Eww, it's a human liver.
Is this yours, Carl?

08:45.358 --> 08:46.848
Oh, all right. Here we go.

08:46.893 --> 08:49.794
I don't know. Who cares?

08:49.829 --> 08:51.353
Dead weight is what that is.

08:51.397 --> 08:53.922
- C-c-can I have it?
- No, Meatwad.

08:53.966 --> 08:55.991
What? I'm about to die
of hunger here.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.559
I need meat!

09:00.806 --> 09:03.604
Oh, yes! Today is the day!

09:03.643 --> 09:05.611
The glory train is taking off!

09:05.645 --> 09:06.771
For what?

09:06.812 --> 09:08.439
Well, I get that case of beer,
like you promised.

09:08.481 --> 09:09.880
Look, Shake,
you're not part of the bet.

09:09.916 --> 09:12.384
- You never were.
- But I want to be.

09:12.418 --> 09:14.147
Well, you're not. Meatwad,
I'm gonna go check on Carl.

09:14.186 --> 09:15.847
See if he's ready
to step on those scales.

09:15.888 --> 09:19.346
Well, I'll be here, waiting to
reap in the glory of winning.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.859
And we're renaming the house...

09:20.893 --> 09:22.827
the Master Shake Title Town!

09:22.862 --> 09:25.353
T- I-T... aah!

09:25.398 --> 09:26.922
Uh, Carl? You in here?

09:26.966 --> 09:29.230
Carl? Hello?

09:29.268 --> 09:31.099
- Yeah?
- No.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.105
I got to tell you, man,
I can hear you...

09:33.139 --> 09:35.630
like, talking,
from your living room.

09:35.675 --> 09:38.235
I got some sort of crazy,
amazing hearing.

09:38.277 --> 09:39.904
They don't tell you
about that in the book.

09:39.946 --> 09:41.208
What are you doing?

09:41.247 --> 09:43.147
Eh, it's part of the diet.
They say, you know...

09:43.182 --> 09:44.945
if you, uh, want to slide
around on your stomach...

09:44.984 --> 09:46.781
don't fight the urge.

09:46.819 --> 09:48.184
You realize you're
up on the ceiling, Carl.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.915
Oh. Oh, yeah, that.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.651
I like to be
next to this light.

09:51.691 --> 09:52.953
Like, real next to it.

09:52.992 --> 09:55.426
What? What are you, queer?

09:55.461 --> 09:56.758
Oh, Carl!

09:56.796 --> 09:59.594
I told you I could eat
whatever I want with this diet.

09:59.632 --> 10:02.100
It's friggin' great!
And the kicker...

10:02.134 --> 10:04.034
no long-term ramifications.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.163
Whatever.
Whatever, whenever, Carl, OK?

10:06.205 --> 10:07.866
Look, it's time for
the weigh-in.

10:07.907 --> 10:11.001
I had no idea there was so much
protein in these, you know?

10:11.043 --> 10:12.670
Hey.

10:12.712 --> 10:14.236
- Meat!
- Meatwad, no!

10:14.280 --> 10:16.441
Hey, that's no fair!
He can't be taking stuff off...

10:16.482 --> 10:18.416
before he gets on the scale!

10:18.451 --> 10:20.544
Just prop me
against the wall over there.

10:20.586 --> 10:23.885
Hang on, everybody, wait.
I'm about to win this bitch.

10:23.923 --> 10:25.754
You're not part
of the damn bet, Shake.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.918
Oh, yeah?
Is that what you think?

10:27.960 --> 10:29.450
Why don't you
hit that switch over there...

10:29.495 --> 10:30.792
and then you tell me?

10:30.830 --> 10:33.025
Aah!

10:34.967 --> 10:37.162
All right.
Get on the scale, Meatwad.

10:37.203 --> 10:38.534
How are we looking?

10:38.571 --> 10:40.368
You weigh...

10:40.406 --> 10:42.704
two more pounds
than you did last week.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.642
Oh, fudge.

10:44.677 --> 10:47.043
Does anyone want some?

10:47.079 --> 10:48.944
It's good.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.313
Got nuts in it.

10:51.350 --> 10:54.012
- Carl, you ready?
- It's pecan fudge.

10:54.053 --> 10:56.851
Yeah. Ha ha ha ha. We're doing
this thing right now.

10:56.889 --> 10:58.322
And it is in your...

11:01.861 --> 11:03.385
I win, brother!

11:03.429 --> 11:05.260
I win, I win, I win!

11:05.297 --> 11:07.629
In your face, Frylock. I win.

11:08.734 --> 11:10.361
Come on,
where's everybody going?

11:10.403 --> 11:12.462
<i>Dancing is forbidden</i>

11:12.505 --> 11:15.201
<i>Dancing is forbidden</i>

11:15.241 --> 11:17.505
<i>Dancing is forbidden</i>

11:17.543 --> 11:19.477
<i>Dancing is forbidden</i>
