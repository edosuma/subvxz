00:07.529 --> 00:09.226
Was that even food?

00:09.313 --> 00:13.230
I believe it was
cheese at one time.

I get three meat toppings
for the price of one!

No, no! Buy two pizzas,
get one free!

01:25.781 --> 01:26.912
That's two free cheesepizzas!

01:26.999 --> 01:28.523
I'd rather eat vomit!

sends this family into a frenzy.

from totally losing perspective.

I need toppings!

Why don't we just get
the stuffed crust special?

01:44.930 --> 01:47.150
And lose my free bucket of soda?
Are you insane?!

01:47.237 --> 01:49.065
Now, listen, Dennis,
I'm a reasonable man,

01:49.152 --> 01:50.849
but I can't go back to my family

01:50.936 --> 01:53.417
with a lot of lawyer talk
about coupon expiration dates.

01:53.504 --> 01:55.593
So why don't we just reduce
the two three-fers to two-fers?

01:55.680 --> 01:57.291
Five toppings on each,

01:57.378 --> 01:58.988

gonna lose those wings!

What?

02:15.483 --> 02:18.312
My father died.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.405
It was weird
going to Grandpa's funeral.

02:24.492 --> 02:26.494
We hardly even knew
we had a grandpa,

02:26.581 --> 02:28.104

02:28.191 --> 02:30.237
Reese is taking it really hard.

02:30.324 --> 02:31.977

Why! Why!

02:32.064 --> 02:35.416
Why couldn't he die
beforehe lost all his money?

02:38.810 --> 02:40.769
You okay?

02:40.856 --> 02:43.206
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:43.293 --> 02:44.338
Are you sure?

02:45.730 --> 02:48.820
It seems a little weird that
the second you come home

02:48.907 --> 02:52.084
from your father's funeral,
you turn on Sports Bloopers.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.477
-Hey.
-Hal...

02:53.564 --> 02:56.306
it is not healthy to keep
all this bottled up.

02:56.393 --> 02:59.962
I agree. I just don't have
anything to un-bottle.

03:00.049 --> 03:03.313
I mean, I thought I'd cry
when I saw him in the box.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.272
I thought I'd cry
when they closed it.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.883
I thought I'd cry
when they put it in the ground

03:07.970 --> 03:11.408
and I threw dirt on him,
but... nothing.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.149
Actually, I did get
a little misty

03:13.236 --> 03:15.543
listening to the funeral
we passed on the way out.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.762
Do you know that man
was the shoeshine guy

03:17.849 --> 03:20.156
on the same corner for 40 years?

03:20.243 --> 03:23.333
Hal, you don't have to be brave.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.640
I'm not. You know me.

03:25.727 --> 03:28.251
I cried at that movie
about the boxing wallaby.

03:28.338 --> 03:29.339
I remember.

03:29.426 --> 03:31.298
I think I'm not feeling anything

03:31.385 --> 03:34.170
because I never really had
a relationship with him.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.563
I mean, I suppose
he knew my name,

03:35.650 --> 03:37.565
but he'd always just
called me "buddy."

03:37.652 --> 03:38.696
Oh, Hal.

03:38.783 --> 03:40.742
So, now a relationship that was

03:40.829 --> 03:44.398
totally meaningless and trivial
is over.

03:44.485 --> 03:47.183
It's hard to get too upset.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.015
[ loudly]:
Hey, Lois. I'm returning

03:53.102 --> 03:55.452

on Y2K.

03:55.539 --> 03:57.149
It's okay, Abe.
Hal's asleep.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.326
Good.
How's he doing?

03:59.413 --> 04:01.545
Well, he seems to be doing fine,
but he can't be.

04:01.632 --> 04:03.155
His father just died.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.201
He got more upset when
his transmission gave out.

04:05.288 --> 04:07.377
Well, he did just
have it rebuilt.

04:07.464 --> 04:08.813
But I know what you're saying.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.033
Sounds like he needs
to talk to someone.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.731
Abe, thank you!
I know he respects you.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.994
Not me.I don't want
to see him cry.

04:16.081 --> 04:17.779
He needs to talk
to a professional.

04:17.866 --> 04:18.867
A therapist?

04:18.954 --> 04:20.390
No, a professional actor.

04:20.476 --> 04:24.438
I suggest William Shatner,
TV's Captain Kirk.

04:24.525 --> 04:25.830
What?

04:25.917 --> 04:27.267
That's who I turn to
in a time of need.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.355
Lois...

04:28.442 --> 04:30.748
there's this wonderful service

04:30.835 --> 04:33.838
where they hook up ordinary
people with celebrities.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.318
You pay a fee,

04:35.405 --> 04:37.755
and you get a phone
call from your choice

04:37.842 --> 04:39.409
of participating
TV or movie stars.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.933
Well, mostly TV stars.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.762
And you think this is something
Hal would want?

04:44.849 --> 04:48.549
Absolutely! He's a huge
fan of classic Trek.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.855
It's not something you
share with your wife.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.161
Lois, believe me,

04:52.248 --> 04:53.597
I don't think I
would've gotten

04:53.684 --> 04:55.338
through my social
anxiety disorder

04:55.425 --> 04:58.472
without a few late-night
discussions with Agent Mulder.

04:58.559 --> 05:03.172
It turns out the truth
was right in here.

05:03.259 --> 05:06.001
Apparently, Shatner's
not available.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.394
He's being knighted.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.960
Well, thanks for trying, Abe.

05:09.047 --> 05:10.527
Oh, it's not over yet.

05:10.614 --> 05:13.661
I am not going to rest
until a classic TV star

05:13.748 --> 05:16.316
puts Hal's spirit at ease.

but this is a funeral.

a math teacher or something.

Why aren't you throwing
yourselves on my coffin

instead of me?

as little as I am?

when my wart fell off.

underneath a tree,

But my friend's father
just died,

10:05.866 --> 10:06.736
Mmm.

10:06.823 --> 10:07.737
Pudding!

10:07.824 --> 10:09.347
[ whooping]

10:09.434 --> 10:11.523
[ Hal neighs]

10:12.960 --> 10:14.004
[shrieks]

10:18.052 --> 10:19.575
[ gasps]
[ car brakes squeal outside]

10:19.662 --> 10:21.838
[ whispers]:
It's your mother!

10:21.925 --> 10:23.710
MALCOLM: Hurry!

10:23.797 --> 10:25.668
[ door opens and closes]

10:27.583 --> 10:29.454
Oh, hi, honey.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.980
God, I hate school.

10:33.067 --> 10:35.199
What's to eat
in this dump?

10:36.505 --> 10:38.768
-Good night, boys.
-Good night, Dad.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.770
What a day.
Memorable, huh?

10:40.857 --> 10:41.989
And if you thought

10:42.076 --> 10:43.294
today was fun,

10:43.381 --> 10:45.035
tomorrow's gonna make it
look like garbage.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.603
Quick question.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.736
If I died in my sleep tonight,
who'd be sad?

10:49.823 --> 10:51.389
I would!
Me! Me!

10:52.869 --> 10:54.958
Sure. Of course
we'd be sad.

10:55.045 --> 10:56.699
You boys have just earned
some s'mores.

10:56.786 --> 10:57.700
Back in a jiff.

10:58.832 --> 10:59.876
Wait, Dad.

10:59.963 --> 11:02.662
You don't have
to do this.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.402
I think I know
what's going on.

11:04.489 --> 11:05.839
If you want to
talk about stuff...

11:05.926 --> 11:07.928
Malcolm, all I'm interested in
right now

11:08.015 --> 11:11.148
is filling your bellies
with marshmallow-y goodness.

11:11.235 --> 11:12.715
-But, Dad...
-Don't worry.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.499
I'll make yours double thick.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.459
This is so awesome.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.548
Yeah. I don't know what alien
worm burrowed into Dad's brain,

11:19.635 --> 11:21.071
but I'd like to shake its hand.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.638
Don't you guys see
what's going on?

11:22.725 --> 11:24.422
This is all because of Grandpa.

11:24.509 --> 11:25.902
Ever since he died,
Dad's been feeling bad

11:25.989 --> 11:27.425
because he doesn't
miss him enough.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.558
So now he's trying to compensate
by bonding with us.

11:29.645 --> 11:30.864
That's just a lot
of fancy language

11:30.951 --> 11:32.039
for all-you-can-eat s'mores.

11:32.126 --> 11:33.997
This isn't fun and games, Reese.

11:34.084 --> 11:36.391
He's got a real
emotional problem.

11:38.088 --> 11:41.265
You think Dad could really be
doing this to buy our love?

11:41.352 --> 11:42.789
I guess.

11:42.876 --> 11:46.444
I say we squeeze him
for all he's got.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.403
It's the least we
could do for him.

11:56.628 --> 11:57.629
Where's Dad?

11:57.717 --> 11:58.761
It was weird.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.241
I got up early
this morning

12:00.328 --> 12:01.633
and found him sitting
at the kitchen table

12:01.721 --> 12:03.200
looking at a picture
of him and Grandpa

12:03.287 --> 12:04.506
with this peaceful
smile on his face.

12:04.593 --> 12:05.768
-Really?
-Yeah.

12:05.855 --> 12:06.900
Then he said he
really worked

12:06.987 --> 12:08.205
some things out
last night.

12:08.292 --> 12:09.076
And then he just
took off for work.

12:09.163 --> 12:10.512
Wow.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.470
Hey, get your greedy
mitts off my lunch!

12:12.557 --> 12:14.124
I was just moving it
to get to my lunch.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.952
What lunch?

12:16.953 --> 12:18.520
Later.

12:19.651 --> 12:20.652
Get off me!

12:20.740 --> 12:22.567
[ door closes]

12:22.654 --> 12:24.482
[ laughing]

12:25.701 --> 12:26.833
Found you!

12:26.920 --> 12:27.877
Hey!

12:27.964 --> 12:29.357
Well, you have to admit

12:29.444 --> 12:31.011
it was pretty good
hiding place.

12:31.098 --> 12:33.187
-I was in there for over
an hour!
-I helped.

12:33.274 --> 12:34.928
And you should
share the prize.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.320
Hey, where's Malcolm?

12:36.407 --> 12:37.669
He had to go to school.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.193
Yeah, he said this was stupid.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.500
Too bad. I guess
he misses out on Motocross!

12:42.587 --> 12:44.111
Sweet!

12:44.198 --> 12:47.767
I mean, I guess it's okay.

12:47.854 --> 12:50.117
Come on. It'll be
better than yesterday.

12:50.204 --> 12:51.553
What was yesterday?

12:51.640 --> 12:53.598
I can't quite remember.
Can you, Dewey?

12:53.685 --> 12:55.513
I knocked you
into pudding.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.343
I guess the problem with
memories is they fade.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.041
Especially in the minds
of young people

13:01.128 --> 13:03.391
that are scrambled with
video games and death metal.

13:03.478 --> 13:04.653
I can barely remember
my own name.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.786
Hey, you know
what doesn't fade?

13:06.873 --> 13:08.048
Things.

13:08.135 --> 13:09.571
Like these pants.

13:09.658 --> 13:11.660
I can still remember
the crisp September day

13:11.747 --> 13:13.270
when Mom gave them to us.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.098
She had a little lipstick
on her upper tooth.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.708
Her eyes crinkled...

13:16.796 --> 13:18.232
She smelled like lilacs.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.450
Hey, you know what?

13:19.537 --> 13:21.061
Ican get you things.

13:21.148 --> 13:22.889
I don't know.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.629
You'd have to drive us to
some kind of mall or something.

13:24.716 --> 13:26.196
You boys go get in the car.

13:26.283 --> 13:27.719
I'm going to call
the credit card company

13:27.807 --> 13:29.025
and have them up my limit.

13:29.112 --> 13:31.549
Taken care of.
[ cackles]

13:33.290 --> 13:35.075
Nice.

13:35.162 --> 13:38.382
It's just a shame I'll have
to catch it with a dirty mitt.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.127
I want to remember

13:44.214 --> 13:45.433
how great you are in spring,

13:45.520 --> 13:46.869
summer, fall...

13:46.956 --> 13:48.871
and winter, too.

13:50.003 --> 13:52.744
Wow, Dad, you bought
the whole store!

13:52.832 --> 13:55.530
Nobody's got
a better dad than us.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.575
Except Joe Garoogian.

13:57.662 --> 13:58.663
Dewey!

13:58.750 --> 13:59.664
You don't deserve
to remember

13:59.751 --> 14:01.014
how good Dad is.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.363
You only deserve to remember me

14:02.450 --> 14:03.538
whacking the crap out of you.

14:03.625 --> 14:04.974
Not so fast, Reese.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.455
The boy's just being honest.
Now tell me,

14:07.542 --> 14:10.632
what is it about this Joe's
father that's so great?

14:10.719 --> 14:13.156
His dad's vice president
of an electronics company.

14:13.243 --> 14:16.768
He can get any type of TV,
video game or stereo he wants.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.814
Is there an electronics store
near here?

14:18.901 --> 14:19.771
Tech Boys on Willow.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.034
Price Town's closer,

14:21.121 --> 14:22.862
but they have crap
for high-def.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.038
[ knocking on door]

14:29.216 --> 14:30.608
I've got something for Hal

14:30.695 --> 14:32.393
that I think may
do the trick.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.743
Abe, I thought
we were done with this.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.571
I thought we were, too, Lois,

14:36.658 --> 14:38.225
until 3:00 this morning

14:38.312 --> 14:40.705
when I found myself in a
collectibles auction site

14:40.792 --> 14:42.272
and saw this baby.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.582
Yes, it's a Vulcan lyre

14:47.669 --> 14:49.932
with ten preprogrammed
Christmas carols.

14:50.019 --> 14:52.848
[ alien version of
O Come, All Ye Faithful
playing]

14:52.935 --> 14:55.111
Abe, I'm sorry.
I know you're trying to help,

14:55.198 --> 14:57.766
but this is not what Hal needs.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.463
You're right.

14:59.550 --> 15:01.726
I guess I got carried
away and lost sight

15:01.813 --> 15:03.728
of what got us started
in the first place...

15:03.815 --> 15:07.080
to hook Hal up with a member of
the original cast of Star Trek.

15:07.167 --> 15:08.342
That's not what got
this started.

15:08.429 --> 15:10.344
Abe, Hal's father died.

15:10.431 --> 15:12.563
And I will not let him
die in vain.

15:12.650 --> 15:13.869
I will call Sulu.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.479
I will call Chekhov.

15:15.566 --> 15:16.916
And if they say no,

15:17.003 --> 15:20.049
so help me,
I will call the Gorn.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.138
Abe, stop, just stop.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.140
I appreciate
you trying to help,

15:24.227 --> 15:25.663
but I don't need
any of this.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.709
I'm going to take Hal
to a bed and breakfast

15:27.796 --> 15:29.189
for a nice weekend,
and that's it.

15:29.276 --> 15:30.668
He just needs
some emotional comfort.

15:30.755 --> 15:33.149
So you think a weekend
of nurturing and sex

15:33.236 --> 15:34.542
is going to get him
through this?

15:34.629 --> 15:36.979
Do you even know this man?!

15:40.069 --> 15:41.592
What the hell's all this?

15:41.679 --> 15:44.117
Turns out Dad still has
some grieving left to do.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.509
I can't believe you.

15:45.596 --> 15:46.902
You lied to me

15:46.989 --> 15:47.816
and you totally
took advantage of him.

15:47.903 --> 15:48.904
I don't see it that way.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.819
They say money
can't buy love...

15:50.906 --> 15:52.125
but they're wrong.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.214
I'm actually
starting to love Dad.

15:54.301 --> 15:56.303
Now I'm not saying
somebody couldn't come
along and outbid him,

15:56.390 --> 15:58.827
but right now,
he's the front-runner.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.220
You can't do this.

16:00.307 --> 16:01.699
This is wrong.

16:01.786 --> 16:02.874
You're giving all this back.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.746
Who are you
to question his process?

16:04.833 --> 16:05.790
Reese, he's crazy.

16:05.877 --> 16:06.922
Mom's crazy.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.271
But she's the kind of crazy

16:08.358 --> 16:10.317
where all she does
is yell at us and punish.

16:10.404 --> 16:13.711
Now Dad's crazy in a way
where he buys us an Xbox 360.

16:13.798 --> 16:15.148
And you want to mess with that?

16:15.235 --> 16:17.150
You're just afraid
of happiness, Malcolm.

16:17.237 --> 16:18.673
You can delude yourself
all you want.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.196
All this is going back
to the store.

16:20.283 --> 16:22.068
Hey, give that back!
You had your chance!

16:22.155 --> 16:24.200
Reese, this is over!
This is the only good thing

16:24.287 --> 16:26.507
that's ever happened around here
and you're ruining it!

16:26.594 --> 16:27.682
Boys! What are you doing?

16:27.769 --> 16:29.466
Today's a happy day.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.642
You're supposed to remember
this the rest of your lives.

16:31.729 --> 16:33.079
I need to talk to you, Dad.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.558
Dad, if you love us,
don't listen to him.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.169
Look at what you're doing.

16:36.256 --> 16:37.648
Look at the money
you're spending.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.302
Look at the reason
why you're spending it.

16:39.389 --> 16:40.869
Something is very wrong.

16:40.956 --> 16:44.003
I hear you, Malcolm.

16:44.090 --> 16:48.529
I understand that things have
gotten a little unbalanced

16:48.616 --> 16:50.574
and I know what
I need to do.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.663
Thank God.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.622
I'm going to buy you a car.

16:57.668 --> 17:00.367
It's moments like this
that really define character.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.978
I love you, Daddy!

17:03.065 --> 17:04.371
[ laughing]

17:05.675 --> 17:06.938
No, it's not our honeymoon,

17:07.026 --> 17:09.550
but I would like
the honeymoon suite.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.117
What?

17:11.204 --> 17:13.336
No, that must be a mistake.

17:13.423 --> 17:14.945
My credit card
can't be maxed out.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.209
I just paid the bill.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.994
Reese!

17:20.082 --> 17:21.561
Get me out of this.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.702
Malcolm's getting a car.

17:31.789 --> 17:33.574
We only did this
so Dad wouldn't buy us

17:33.661 --> 17:34.618
something more expensive.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.361
I miss Grandpa.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.715
I know this is wrong.

17:44.802 --> 17:47.892
But somehow my body's not doing
anything to stop it.

17:47.979 --> 17:50.765
Maybe that means at some level,
I don't even know it's wrong.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.593
And if I don't know
if it's wrong,

17:52.680 --> 17:54.377
then I can't get blamed
for doing it.

17:54.464 --> 17:55.900
Right?

17:55.987 --> 17:57.206
Now, the high-tech package

17:57.293 --> 17:59.600
comes with a CG
rearview imaging system,

17:59.687 --> 18:02.211
a GPS and a DVD.

18:02.298 --> 18:04.735
I don't absolutely need
a DVD player.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.694
Sure you do, Malcolm.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.522
Every time you stop
at a red light,

18:08.609 --> 18:11.351
I want you watching movies,
thinking of your dad.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.309
-What else have we got?
-Want the sports package?

18:13.396 --> 18:16.225
That's like asking
if we want doors.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.316
There it is,
every option we offer,

18:20.403 --> 18:21.883
including some
I didn't even know about.

18:21.970 --> 18:24.190
Floor mats have
undercoating.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.496
Comes with
a 14-year warranty.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.889
We don't sell
many of those.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.282
All it needs...

18:29.369 --> 18:31.371
is your signature.

18:38.726 --> 18:40.249
Huh...

18:40.336 --> 18:41.903
What?

18:41.990 --> 18:43.644
My dad had this same pen.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.820
He must've been a great guy.
This is a great pen.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.909
We don't really need
to get into that right now.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.345
See, I just lost my dad.

18:49.432 --> 18:51.434
I'm sorry.

18:51.521 --> 18:54.350
Bet he would've loved
to have seen his grandson

18:54.437 --> 18:56.918
driving that sports pack.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.573
[ whispering]
You know...

18:59.660 --> 19:01.096
I don't know
if he would have.

19:01.183 --> 19:04.317
He was pretty
emotionally distant.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.710
He had a lot of trouble
showing love.

19:06.797 --> 19:09.713
Yeah.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.803
Old-timers, eh?

19:12.890 --> 19:15.806
But I didn't care.

19:15.893 --> 19:18.244
I didn't care
if he had trouble.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.337
I loved him.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.382
He was my dad.

19:26.469 --> 19:29.211
You know, I see that
you're in a lot of pain

19:29.298 --> 19:31.082
right now...

19:31.170 --> 19:33.084
I'm going to need some
grief counseling, too,

19:33.172 --> 19:37.045
if I let you take me up on
this offer I'm giving you.

19:37.132 --> 19:40.440
I remember coming downstairs
in the morning

19:40.527 --> 19:43.225
and he would be at the table
and he would say, "Hey, buddy,

19:43.312 --> 19:45.009
"I'm doing four things at once:

19:45.096 --> 19:48.404
"I'm watching TV,
I'm reading the newspaper,

19:48.491 --> 19:50.363
I'm drinking coffee,
and I'm talking to you."

19:50.450 --> 19:51.712
[ chuckling]

19:51.799 --> 19:54.671
Isn't that amazing?

19:54.758 --> 19:56.978
You know, I got a guy
whose wife died

19:57.065 --> 19:58.588
who's looking at
this car, so...

19:58.675 --> 20:02.766
He didn't have to do
anything for me.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.162
He was my dad.

20:09.512 --> 20:11.775
Dad...

20:11.862 --> 20:14.213
you don't have to do
anything for me, either.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.999
But if you want to...

20:18.086 --> 20:19.392
that'd be great.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.272
I lost my dad.

20:32.143 --> 20:33.232
I know.

20:41.370 --> 20:43.111
[ doorbell rings]

20:47.681 --> 20:48.769
Hello?

20:48.856 --> 20:50.161
I'm George Takei.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.338
I played Sulu on Star Trek.

20:52.425 --> 20:55.384
Did your grandfather
die recently?

20:55.471 --> 20:56.864
Yes.

20:56.951 --> 20:59.606
Allow me to extend
my deepest condolences.

20:59.693 --> 21:01.390
I got a call
from a neighbor

21:01.477 --> 21:03.523
that your father might
like to talk to me.

21:03.610 --> 21:06.003
And when I called back,
the line was busy.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.831
So I decided to come over.

21:07.918 --> 21:12.836
It was a six-hour bus ride
with a lot of stops.

21:12.923 --> 21:15.361
May I have some water, please?

21:15.448 --> 21:17.667
Sorry, my parents aren't home.

21:17.754 --> 21:19.321
But you can use
the hose out front.

21:19.408 --> 21:21.454
Delightful.
If you don't mind,

21:21.541 --> 21:22.977
I'll make camp
on your front lawn

21:23.064 --> 21:24.935
in anticipation
of their return.

21:25.022 --> 21:28.243
Improvisation:
my stock and trade.

21:28.330 --> 21:31.115
In episode 18,
"The Squire of Gothos,"

21:31.202 --> 21:35.772
the script read,
"the crew ad-libs 'hello.'"

21:35.859 --> 21:39.428
Well, I was off
to the races.

21:39.515 --> 21:41.996
Well, I've got
a lot of homework.

21:44.825 --> 21:47.088
Ooh, mushrooms!

21:47.175 --> 21:49.482
May I help myself?

22:27.911 --> 22:30.349
