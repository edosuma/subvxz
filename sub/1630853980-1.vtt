WEBVTT

00:17.768 --> 00:19.353
Shields up!

00:44.419 --> 00:45.921
Hold position!

00:46.004 --> 00:47.005
Hold!

00:57.349 --> 00:58.976
Shield formation!

01:02.855 --> 01:05.399
Hold the line! Hold--

01:17.202 --> 01:19.580
Hold! Hold them back!

01:25.419 --> 01:27.045
There's too many of them.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.423
Fall back!

01:29.506 --> 01:31.383
Go! Go!

01:58.535 --> 01:59.703
Let's go!

03:38.093 --> 03:39.303
Drop the gate.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.654
How glorious
the pain of childbirth, Maghra.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.156
You never told me.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.575
You forget quickly.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.535
Liar.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.997
-Queen.
-What?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.081
Queen.

04:08.707 --> 04:09.833
What is it?

04:10.834 --> 04:14.755
There's still no birth water, only blood.
Too much blood.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.973
-Try and be calm and--
-You be calm.

04:27.226 --> 04:30.562
I'm being torn open from the inside out.

04:31.063 --> 04:33.732
-Help her to her feet.
-No.

04:33.815 --> 04:34.983
-Yes.
-No.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.109
Yes, Sibeth.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.779
Come on.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.700
Yes. Yes.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.746
Straps. Bend.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.625
Yes.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.419
And the other one.

04:55.712 --> 04:56.713
All right.

05:03.011 --> 05:06.431
Sibeth, I need you to stop pushing.

05:06.515 --> 05:07.558
I can't!

05:07.641 --> 05:10.561
You must. The baby is still in its veil.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.856
It must be born in its water sack
or risk having no breath.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.942
So get it out with the sack!

05:17.526 --> 05:18.569
Wait.

05:22.239 --> 05:26.368
I'm protecting it. Now push.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.829
Push!

05:34.168 --> 05:35.169
Yes.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.355
Harmony.

05:56.732 --> 06:00.194
Why do I hear nothing? Make my baby cry.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.403
We are trying.

06:30.474 --> 06:31.683
It's a boy.

06:37.648 --> 06:40.817
A veiled birth is a good omen,
a baby consecrated by water.

06:44.029 --> 06:47.366
God Flame has blessed me
with a sighted prophet.

06:49.868 --> 06:54.414
We'll name him Wolffe after our father.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.090
He's hungry.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.509
Maghra, please let me feed him.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.054
We have a wet nurse ready for that.

07:14.977 --> 07:17.145
You would deny the baby his mother's milk?

07:18.105 --> 07:19.606
Don't start, Sibeth.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.326
A queen who can deliver a baby.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.455
I forgot you once were an Alkenny peasant.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.000
It was Paris who taught me.

07:39.084 --> 07:42.421
And you would do well remembering her name
when you ask for sympathy.

07:43.172 --> 07:45.966
That mountain woman wanted
to take my baby.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.010
Well, now I am taking your baby.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.262
Are you going to kill me as well?

07:53.849 --> 07:55.058
You never know.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.935
-My queen.
-Already?

07:57.019 --> 07:59.688
-Time is of the essence.
-I told him he was rushing things.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.191
-You said the time was now.
-I was being ironic.

08:02.900 --> 08:07.029
Maghra,
clearly this is a deeply emotional moment.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.113
And I know--

08:08.197 --> 08:11.033
The Trivantians will soon know
of the baby.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.492
When Ambassador Trovere arrives,

08:12.576 --> 08:14.786
she'll be expecting
to take custody of Sibeth

08:14.870 --> 08:17.331
to take her trophy back to Trivantes.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.749
These are the terms you agreed to.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.209
There's no stopping him
once he gets--

08:20.292 --> 08:23.921
-Harlan!
-But he's not wrong, strictly speaking.

08:25.506 --> 08:28.550
Maghra, you did promise the Trivantians
your sister once she delivered.

08:28.634 --> 08:30.761
Would either of you like to feed the baby?

08:32.429 --> 08:33.429
No?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.265
Well, then you are
of no use to me right now.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.231
What will you say to Trovere?

08:43.524 --> 08:47.069
I'm glad you asked. I have no idea.

08:57.788 --> 09:01.083
Thank you, Maghra. Thank you.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.044
Only until the wet nurse arrives.

09:04.837 --> 09:06.338
There you go, little man.

09:09.758 --> 09:10.884
Little Wolffe.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.562
Can you see me?

09:24.815 --> 09:26.066
Can you see your mama?

09:35.200 --> 09:40.581
You're the child of prophecy
sent to me by the God Flame.

09:56.805 --> 10:00.475
Don't you worry.
I will not let them take you from me.

11:29.273 --> 11:32.484
That was our third company retreat
in as many days.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.444
What is happening out there?

11:34.945 --> 11:39.157
They are a bunch of savages.
We are Trivantian soldiers.

11:39.241 --> 11:41.869
They move with the wind. We hear nothing.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.204
And now they know where our camp is.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.459
They're going to find a way down here.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.880
We are outnumbered.
We can't defend this position.

11:54.006 --> 11:56.091
Captain Wren, do you hear yourself?

11:57.134 --> 11:59.761
We were sent here
to quell a primitive uprising,

11:59.845 --> 12:02.598
and instead,
it is turning into a full-scale war.

12:02.681 --> 12:05.309
-And it's a war you're losing.
-Who is that?

12:06.143 --> 12:09.146
Lieutenant Commander Tormada of Base 3,

12:09.730 --> 12:13.567
under the direct command
of the late General Edo Voss.

12:13.650 --> 12:18.113
Tormada, I've heard of you.
Edo's chief scientist.

12:18.197 --> 12:20.657
I didn't think
Base 3 was still operational

12:20.741 --> 12:22.159
after the general's passing.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.995
Wren, you were at Base 3, weren't you?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.830
-Yes, sir.
-Captain Wren.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.293
Edo spoke highly of you.

12:36.048 --> 12:37.174
Thank you, sir.

12:37.883 --> 12:40.093
You were a survivor of Greenhill Gap.

12:42.596 --> 12:45.682
Without poor Edo
to shoulder the blame for that defeat,

12:45.766 --> 12:49.102
I imagine there was more than enough
to mete out for everyone else.

12:49.937 --> 12:53.649
It is no doubt why you were exiled here.

12:53.732 --> 12:56.860
My apologies, Lieutenant Commander,

12:56.944 --> 13:00.822
but why would the military send
a scientist out to the front lines?

13:00.906 --> 13:03.784
Because science is
gonna save you, Colonel.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.329
Science is gonna win this war for you.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.622
Wren is right.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.375
The Ganites will be here by morning,
if not sooner.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.501
Well then, my friends,

13:12.584 --> 13:15.337
you will be reporting
complete victory by morning.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.381
With all due respect,
Lieutenant Commander,

13:17.464 --> 13:19.716
you have no idea
what we're up against here.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.760
With all due respect,

13:23.136 --> 13:26.139
you have no idea
what I've brought with me.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.271
Hush, little baby
Don't say a word

13:32.980 --> 13:36.733
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

13:37.276 --> 13:41.363
And if that mockingbird don't sing

13:41.864 --> 13:45.576
Mama's gonna buy you a bell to ring

13:46.368 --> 13:50.247
And if that little bell gets broke

13:50.747 --> 13:54.251
Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat

13:54.751 --> 13:58.422
And if that billy goat won't pull

13:58.922 --> 14:02.634
Mama's gonna buy you a cart and bull

14:06.430 --> 14:07.431
Kofunâ€¦

14:10.809 --> 14:11.894
Come.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.147
Hold your son.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.027
I don't know how.

14:22.571 --> 14:25.866
Every parent knows
how to hold their own child.

14:32.164 --> 14:33.665
He is not my child.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.279
Kofun?

15:07.074 --> 15:08.075
Here.

15:10.285 --> 15:11.578
How'd you find me?

15:12.162 --> 15:14.414
Your mom may be queen,
but it's still my city.

15:15.207 --> 15:19.670
Roddy. One for me and another
for my young friend here, please.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.928
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

15:34.893 --> 15:37.646
You know, if Baba Voss were here--

15:37.729 --> 15:38.856
He's not.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.025
No, I know he's not.
Thank you. I'm just saying--

15:42.109 --> 15:43.151
Well, don't.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.654
You might have married his wife,

15:45.737 --> 15:47.614
but that doesn't mean
you're any kind of father to me.

15:48.198 --> 15:49.825
I have enough of those as it is.

15:51.577 --> 15:53.328
I think you know me well enough by now

15:53.412 --> 15:56.874
to know I don't want to be
anybody's father ever. Thank you.

15:56.957 --> 15:57.958
All right.

16:01.545 --> 16:04.214
My own father worked for your grandfather.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.217
He was a good man.

16:08.719 --> 16:13.640
He was very kind,
very fair, very affectionate.

16:13.724 --> 16:15.184
He had this big laugh.

16:18.395 --> 16:20.272
My mother was a different story.

16:21.481 --> 16:26.737
She was smart, cunning, and very cold.

16:28.197 --> 16:31.575
You know, I don't think she ever so much
as held my hand when I was a little boy.

16:32.326 --> 16:35.370
Naturally, she despised my father,
thought he was weak.

16:36.538 --> 16:39.875
And, yeah, sometimes so did I.

16:42.336 --> 16:48.133
As I got older, I began to understand
he wasn't weak at all.

16:49.635 --> 16:55.015
His was a quiet, subtle strength.

16:55.933 --> 16:56.975
That's all.

16:58.644 --> 17:02.147
I mean, to endure my mother
for as long as he did. Fuck me. Gee.

17:04.775 --> 17:10.614
Anyway, I like to think my understanding
of my own father means

17:10.696 --> 17:12.782
there's more of him in me than her.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.743
Why are you telling me this?

17:17.037 --> 17:21.250
Because, having never been one,
I have no advice for a new father.

17:21.750 --> 17:27.339
But for a confused son, you know,
I may be something of an expert.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.925
So, you ready?

17:32.678 --> 17:36.098
You've had a child
with a deranged, murderous woman.

17:36.181 --> 17:38.600
-Oh, fuck, Harlan.
-You know it. She is insane.

17:38.684 --> 17:42.938
But my point is
if any son ever needed a father,

17:44.106 --> 17:45.691
it's not you, you prick.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.862
It's him. It's your boy. All right?

17:51.446 --> 17:52.447
Your son.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.540
And that hasn't helped at all, has it?

18:03.375 --> 18:05.586
Not really. No.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.171
Well, if all else fails,

18:07.254 --> 18:10.090
let's ditch this piss
and get some good mulled wine.

18:11.049 --> 18:13.760
I'm not sure you're gonna find
something like that here.

18:13.844 --> 18:17.890
Shut up. Roddy, the good stuff, please.

18:17.973 --> 18:19.141
You got it, Harlan.

18:21.435 --> 18:25.063
-What?
-Told you. Still my city.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.261
Keep moving.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.278
Ayura, report.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.619
Two hundred strong,

20:02.703 --> 20:04.705
advancing quickly
from the north and south.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.164
Excellent.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.749
Attack formation.

20:09.710 --> 20:11.461
That won't be necessary.

20:14.631 --> 20:15.674
Oloman.

20:16.550 --> 20:17.593
Thirty heartbeats.

20:25.434 --> 20:26.727
They are almost on top of us.

20:26.810 --> 20:28.520
No one moves!

20:33.901 --> 20:35.485
Get ready to charge!

20:35.569 --> 20:38.530
-No! Stand your ground!
-What?

20:45.537 --> 20:48.498
If we do not fight, we will die!

20:48.582 --> 20:50.083
Not today.

20:52.711 --> 20:54.004
Ten heartbeats.

20:54.087 --> 20:57.299
My friends, prepare yourselves.

20:57.382 --> 20:58.926
For what?

21:45.681 --> 21:47.766
It's actually not as uncommon
as you think.

21:47.850 --> 21:50.269
-Thank you.
-I grew up in the foothills of the Cleves,

21:50.352 --> 21:55.899
and there was more than one grandmother
who was also her grandchild's aunt.

21:55.983 --> 22:02.739
In this case, the mother is also the aunt,
which I admit is a bit complicated.

22:03.407 --> 22:07.286
As the father is the mother's nephew,

22:07.369 --> 22:12.040
which would make Kofun
and his son cousins.

22:12.124 --> 22:15.669
No, wait. I think. Yes, that's right.

22:15.752 --> 22:19.882
And that makes you
the baby's aunt and cousin as well.

22:21.717 --> 22:22.926
If you think this is complicated now,

22:23.010 --> 22:25.470
wait until someone has to
explain it all to that baby.

22:26.847 --> 22:28.807
I wonder what the baby should call me.

22:28.891 --> 22:31.685
Aunt Charlotte. Kind of a nice ring.

22:31.768 --> 22:33.937
-Aunt Char-Char.
-And these came in when?

22:34.021 --> 22:35.105
Just this morning.

23:07.638 --> 23:10.682
Edo understood the potential of sight

23:11.350 --> 23:13.936
and the glorious technology
it could unlock.

23:15.771 --> 23:19.566
Unfortunately, we were unable
to perfect our explosives

23:19.650 --> 23:21.318
before his march on Paya.

23:23.111 --> 23:26.657
If we had, my friend would still be here.

23:28.534 --> 23:32.996
I failed him,
and that failure haunts me every day.

23:35.332 --> 23:39.294
So, I will complete the task
he set for me.

23:41.088 --> 23:44.258
The Triangle was very opposed
to Edo's strategy when it came to vision.

23:44.925 --> 23:48.011
The Triangle.
They've gotten too comfortable.

23:48.762 --> 23:51.014
Their failure at Greenhill Gap is
a perfect example

23:51.098 --> 23:53.725
of just how dangerous that can be for us.

23:55.018 --> 24:01.191
Edo beat his drum over and over again,
and they refused to hear it.

24:01.900 --> 24:04.194
But you believe they will hear you.

24:05.696 --> 24:11.952
Well, I think you'll agree
we now have a much louder drum.

24:15.372 --> 24:18.125
You were very loyal to Edo.

24:22.171 --> 24:27.634
And he protected you.
You and your special gift.

24:29.761 --> 24:30.762
Yes.

24:32.181 --> 24:33.849
Edo had no secrets from me.

24:35.017 --> 24:36.685
And now I suppose neither do you.

24:38.520 --> 24:41.690
Together we can finish what Edo started.

24:42.941 --> 24:45.736
I'm assuming I can count on you, Wren?

24:49.114 --> 24:50.282
Of course, sir.

24:52.409 --> 24:57.289
I just-- I'm not sure
what you're asking me to do.

24:57.789 --> 25:01.418
I'm not asking. I'm ordering you.

25:03.045 --> 25:05.964
The war with the Ganites
is as good as over.

25:06.048 --> 25:08.258
We must now
turn our attention to the east.

25:09.927 --> 25:10.928
Paya.

25:11.637 --> 25:15.140
Fertile lands, endless coal,

25:15.224 --> 25:20.145
and must I remind you,
the man who murdered our beloved Edo.

25:21.605 --> 25:24.942
You'll be happy to hear that my spies
have been tracking Baba Voss.

25:25.901 --> 25:29.738
And Edo will soon be properly avenged.

25:30.239 --> 25:35.536
So this all ends with us killing Baba Voss
and conquering Paya?

25:36.453 --> 25:39.039
No. That's where it begins.

25:40.666 --> 25:45.587
What lies beyond Paya? And beyond that?

25:47.381 --> 25:52.052
There are reports of cities
to be conquered in every direction.

25:52.678 --> 25:55.389
We now have a weapon
that makes us truly unstoppable.

25:55.472 --> 25:59.810
We will build the greatest empire
this world has ever known.

26:05.858 --> 26:06.859
Maddox.

26:08.694 --> 26:11.154
Sadly, I must leave you.

26:12.281 --> 26:15.742
This is Lieutenant Maddox,
my right-hand man.

26:17.244 --> 26:20.706
He doesn't say much,
which is one of his many attributes.

26:21.623 --> 26:26.253
He will help you finish your work here
and then escort you back to Trivantes.

26:28.547 --> 26:30.465
I should stay with my battalion.

26:30.549 --> 26:34.428
I think we both know
you are far too valuable for that.

26:36.180 --> 26:39.683
Well, miles to go before I sleep.

26:54.072 --> 26:56.491
I'm telling you, I know what I saw.

26:57.159 --> 27:01.413
Maybe you did.
Or maybe you just wanted it to be true.

27:02.289 --> 27:04.041
There have been
no sighted people for so long,

27:04.124 --> 27:06.293
we cannot simply expect
to start finding them everywhere.

27:06.376 --> 27:08.462
Well, maybe there are more
than we know of.

27:09.046 --> 27:11.006
They just didn't want to be burned
as witches.

27:11.089 --> 27:12.341
Maybe they still don't.

27:13.091 --> 27:16.970
You cannot change the minds of the masses
with a simple decree like Sibeth believed.

27:17.054 --> 27:20.724
It will take years
for the unsighted to accept the sighted.

27:22.476 --> 27:25.437
It was our sight that helped save
the Payan kingdom at Greenhill Gap.

27:25.521 --> 27:28.065
-It was the Hidden Tribes that saved us.
-I said helped.

27:28.148 --> 27:32.402
Look, whoever this Row Vano is,
you should leave him alone.

27:33.278 --> 27:36.573
If he wants to hide his sight,
then let him. I wish I could.

27:37.241 --> 27:38.867
How can you deny who you are?

27:38.951 --> 27:41.119
Because I'm not defined by
the fact that I can see.

27:41.203 --> 27:42.704
Of course you are.

27:42.788 --> 27:44.498
You sound like Jerlamarel.

27:44.581 --> 27:47.251
-And you sound like an ass.
-Haniwa, that's enough.

27:47.334 --> 27:50.003
We finally have the power
to be able to build a world

27:50.087 --> 27:52.464
where people like us
don't have to live in fear.

27:55.175 --> 27:56.385
Don't you want that?

27:58.846 --> 28:00.222
If not for you, for your son?

28:17.906 --> 28:19.533
Has he even seen his baby?

28:20.409 --> 28:21.827
I'm sure we can both understand

28:21.910 --> 28:24.162
this is not how he imagined
becoming a father.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.331
He will need time.

28:31.336 --> 28:33.005
Papa would make him take responsibility

28:33.088 --> 28:34.089
for his son.

28:34.173 --> 28:36.175
Well, he's not here, is he?

28:36.258 --> 28:37.384
And as far as I'm concerned,

28:37.467 --> 28:39.344
Baba is in no position to tell anyone
how to be a father.

28:39.428 --> 28:43.640
-He will come back! You know he will.
-All I know is that he left us.

28:44.808 --> 28:45.809
He left me.

28:47.269 --> 28:48.729
You left him first.

28:51.940 --> 28:55.027
You lied to him, to all of us.

28:55.110 --> 28:59.364
And then you just expected him
to accept all of this. What, your palace?

29:02.117 --> 29:03.118
Your new husband?

29:03.202 --> 29:05.329
What I did, I did for you.

29:06.872 --> 29:07.873
Maybe.

29:10.918 --> 29:15.422
But what you did destroyed him.
And I don't blame him for leaving.

29:21.053 --> 29:22.054
Haniwa!

30:55.480 --> 30:56.815
What's wrong, buddy?

30:58.192 --> 30:59.526
Are you a wolf?

31:04.198 --> 31:06.992
Okay. I'm here to help you.

31:09.745 --> 31:11.330
Please don't bite me.

31:12.206 --> 31:14.166
I don't wanna have to kill you.

31:21.089 --> 31:24.635
Good boy. Oh, yes, good boy.

31:25.844 --> 31:27.513
What are you doing up here?

31:30.766 --> 31:31.767
What is that?

31:32.851 --> 31:36.104
Oh, yeah. What is this?

31:37.648 --> 31:38.774
It's okay.

31:38.857 --> 31:40.901
Yes. I'm gonna get this off.

31:41.693 --> 31:43.570
It's okay. It's okay.

31:44.071 --> 31:45.113
Yes, good boy.

31:46.698 --> 31:49.243
Yeah. Okay.

31:52.412 --> 31:55.457
I have a little bit of food.

31:55.541 --> 31:57.626
Yeah. Okay.

31:59.002 --> 32:00.379
Tastes pretty good.

32:01.004 --> 32:02.589
Yeah, smell.

32:03.590 --> 32:05.801
Yeah, it's right there. There's more.

32:06.802 --> 32:08.929
There! No, no. Okay, okay.

32:09.012 --> 32:12.057
I'm gonna let you go now. Please don't
come at me, or I will kill you.

32:12.558 --> 32:13.559
Go.

33:30.594 --> 33:31.762
Fuck off!

33:33.472 --> 33:34.848
You gonna help me up?

33:38.352 --> 33:40.103
No one could ever sneak up on you.

33:40.771 --> 33:42.439
No one's as noisy as you.

33:43.857 --> 33:45.651
One day, I will surprise you.

33:46.235 --> 33:47.611
That would be a surprise.

33:48.529 --> 33:49.947
Don't move.

33:50.030 --> 33:51.907
Do it, just do it. Do it.

33:51.990 --> 33:56.119
You ready?
Tradition is tradition, my friend.

33:56.870 --> 33:59.540
And you are the loser.

34:04.044 --> 34:07.923
-It stinks!
-I would think you'd be used to it by now.

34:11.009 --> 34:13.387
Your time is gonna come, Baba.

34:15.848 --> 34:17.933
-You done?
-For now.

34:18.766 --> 34:21.061
Good. Let's go climb.

34:21.562 --> 34:23.146
You just scared away dinner.

34:23.230 --> 34:24.940
I'm gonna have to go track down
another buck.

34:26.525 --> 34:27.860
We have enough meat.

34:28.652 --> 34:31.737
In the time you've been here,
you've managed to kill more deer

34:31.822 --> 34:33.407
than we could ever eat.

34:33.489 --> 34:35.492
Makes me wonder
what you're really chasing.

34:38.620 --> 34:41.039
Come on.
I can feel your dark thoughts from here.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.333
Let's go climb.

34:45.210 --> 34:49.380
Clear that shit out of your head.
Clear the shit off of my face.

34:53.135 --> 34:55.429
Let it out. That's right.

35:15.449 --> 35:16.450
You want some?

35:20.412 --> 35:21.538
No, thank you.

35:23.415 --> 35:25.209
It helps with the big questions.

35:26.710 --> 35:27.711
Like what?

35:30.088 --> 35:31.632
Like why you're here.

35:35.093 --> 35:36.762
It's because I belong nowhere else.

35:36.845 --> 35:37.971
You know that.

35:41.350 --> 35:44.353
You have spent your life running
and jumping

35:44.436 --> 35:48.357
and slashing and burning
in the service of others.

35:51.443 --> 35:53.028
Now you're alone, brother.

35:53.612 --> 35:55.739
Time to live in service to yourself.

36:09.211 --> 36:14.883
I have spent my life
trying to protect my familyâ€¦

36:16.885 --> 36:19.263
but I always lead them into more danger.

36:20.806 --> 36:26.645
And I feel like I have cursed

36:26.728 --> 36:30.941
everyone that I love with death and war.

36:33.151 --> 36:35.237
You blame yourself for Edo.

36:38.866 --> 36:40.325
I did not mention him.

36:40.409 --> 36:41.702
He's always there,

36:43.036 --> 36:44.288
floating between your words.

36:44.371 --> 36:46.540
-We already talked about this.
-We have,

36:46.623 --> 36:51.587
but we will continue to talk about it
until it no longer has any power over you.

36:56.258 --> 36:58.010
Baba, I remember your father.

37:00.345 --> 37:02.806
He was a cruel fucker of a man.

37:03.932 --> 37:07.394
You became who you became,
and Edo became Edo.

37:09.730 --> 37:14.109
But at some point,
it's not your father's fault either,

37:14.902 --> 37:16.528
and it certainly isn't yours.

37:19.531 --> 37:22.159
We are responsible for who we become.

37:24.870 --> 37:26.788
And if climbing teaches you nothing else,

37:26.872 --> 37:29.333
it should teach you
your own insignificance.

37:30.375 --> 37:32.753
Even you, Baba Voss,

37:32.836 --> 37:36.548
are nothing more than a speck of shit
on the ass of a bug.

37:40.219 --> 37:41.512
You talk too much.

37:42.387 --> 37:43.764
Maybe it's the herbs.

38:12.793 --> 38:14.419
No! Go away!

38:15.754 --> 38:17.798
Shoo! Go! Leave me alone.

38:17.881 --> 38:20.342
-Your dog is hungry.
-He's not my dog.

38:20.425 --> 38:21.677
Tell him that.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.761
No!

38:23.804 --> 38:24.847
What's his name?

38:25.931 --> 38:27.391
I guess his name's "No."

38:27.474 --> 38:29.810
"No"? That's not a name.

38:29.893 --> 38:31.895
That's the only thing he comes to,
isn't it?

38:31.979 --> 38:33.063
Go away!

38:33.856 --> 38:35.482
Going to be one confused dog.

38:36.733 --> 38:38.318
You should give him a nice name.

38:39.611 --> 38:40.737
You name him.

38:40.821 --> 38:41.989
He's not my dog.

38:42.489 --> 38:43.657
My love!

38:44.908 --> 38:47.077
-Ranger!
-Baba's got a dog.

38:47.619 --> 38:48.871
I don't have a dog!

38:53.917 --> 38:56.044
Ranger, you said you were bringing meat.

38:56.128 --> 38:57.504
He wanted fish.

38:57.588 --> 38:59.715
Yeah, it's better for your brain.

38:59.798 --> 39:02.384
The herbs you smoke have taken
what is left of your brain.

39:02.968 --> 39:04.386
Only the bad parts.

39:05.262 --> 39:06.889
Baba thinks I'm wise, don't you, Baba?

39:07.472 --> 39:08.974
I think I should remain silent.

39:09.558 --> 39:11.435
-I think you should leave.
-Lu.

39:11.518 --> 39:12.853
Don't "Lu" me!

39:12.936 --> 39:15.856
You told me he would stay
for a few days, and it's been months.

39:15.939 --> 39:16.940
Here we go.

39:17.024 --> 39:20.569
He brought about the death
of the Alkenny, my people.

39:21.445 --> 39:24.615
That was the Witchfinders, not Baba.

39:24.698 --> 39:27.451
But you ask me
to hear his voice every day.

39:31.872 --> 39:33.165
I'm not asking.

39:46.303 --> 39:50.557
Do you even remember the Alkenny,
Baba Voss?

39:57.731 --> 39:58.857
Every day.

40:21.421 --> 40:22.422
Chet-chet!

40:22.506 --> 40:23.924
Lion.

40:27.469 --> 40:30.681
You shouldn't be traveling up here
by yourself. This is wolf country.

40:31.181 --> 40:32.683
You shouldn't be here either.

40:33.308 --> 40:35.394
No one should, except maybe the wolves.

40:35.477 --> 40:36.770
This is our home.

40:36.854 --> 40:38.438
A guest should show more respect,

40:38.522 --> 40:41.525
especially one who shows up
uninvited the way you do.

40:41.608 --> 40:43.402
I don't wanna be in this
sad little hiding spot

40:43.485 --> 40:45.195
-any more than you want me here.
-Bow Lion--

40:45.279 --> 40:46.280
We're not hiding.

40:46.864 --> 40:49.825
We're just not wearing the old knots
and bones anymore.

40:51.493 --> 40:54.705
Nations, kingdoms, tribes,
they're all the same.

40:55.372 --> 40:59.251
Can't be a part of any of them
without giving up a piece of your soul

40:59.334 --> 41:00.502
you can never get back.

41:00.586 --> 41:03.213
You don't believe any of this,
do you, Baba?

41:04.631 --> 41:06.508
You were a great leader.

41:08.802 --> 41:11.930
A great leader responsible
for ending an entire tribe.

41:12.014 --> 41:13.140
That wasn't your fault.

41:13.223 --> 41:16.226
No? Whose was it?

41:21.773 --> 41:22.774
Baba?

41:24.943 --> 41:26.320
Go home, Bow Lion.

41:28.280 --> 41:29.281
Please.

41:33.452 --> 41:36.205
I will. When you do.

41:41.502 --> 41:44.296
I thought you promised your mother
you would stop stalking this man.

41:44.379 --> 41:46.924
She insisted. I didn't promise.

41:47.674 --> 41:50.219
Well, if your mother is queen,
and you disobey her,

41:50.302 --> 41:51.929
can you be hung for treason?

41:52.721 --> 41:54.223
Not if she doesn't find out.

41:54.306 --> 41:56.058
Treason or not, this is a bad idea.

41:56.141 --> 41:58.602
Like all of you, I served the monarchy

41:58.685 --> 42:00.437
in the name of the God Flame.

42:02.022 --> 42:03.273
I fought for them.

42:04.816 --> 42:06.109
I bled for them.

42:06.944 --> 42:08.612
And they betrayed me.

42:10.656 --> 42:12.449
They betrayed all of us.

42:15.118 --> 42:17.246
Queen Kane betrayed us.

42:20.249 --> 42:23.627
Tamacti Jun betrayed us,

42:24.878 --> 42:28.382
and the so-called Queen Maghra betrays us,

42:28.882 --> 42:32.302
twisting the word of God
for her own purposes.

42:34.221 --> 42:35.848
Down with the queen.

42:36.974 --> 42:38.600
And so it falls to us,

42:39.768 --> 42:41.228
the Payan people,

42:42.896 --> 42:45.232
to serve the true word of God

42:46.483 --> 42:49.069
by continuing to drive out
the evil of sight,

42:50.696 --> 42:53.198
until the monarchy comes to their senses.

42:55.284 --> 42:56.410
Shiloh,

42:57.786 --> 42:59.037
let's have the witch.

42:59.621 --> 43:02.165
No, please let me go!
You are making a mistake.

43:02.249 --> 43:04.585
I am not a witch! I am not sighted!

43:04.668 --> 43:06.086
-Liar!
-Come on.

43:06.170 --> 43:08.755
We know you can see.
You deal in the devil's magic.

43:08.839 --> 43:11.800
I cannot see. I swear to you.
I am not a witch!

43:16.221 --> 43:18.265
-They can't do this.
-There's too many of them.

43:18.348 --> 43:21.059
-You're sworn to protect the sighted.
-That's what I'm doing. Let's go.

43:21.143 --> 43:22.811
-What about him?
-We go now!

43:22.895 --> 43:25.606
Stop this! Stop!

43:28.025 --> 43:29.484
He is an innocent man.

43:30.652 --> 43:32.321
And what proof do you have of that?

43:36.617 --> 43:38.285
Because I can see his eyes.

43:38.869 --> 43:40.078
Okay, shit.

43:40.162 --> 43:42.915
I am Princess Haniwa,
daughter of Queen Maghra,

43:42.998 --> 43:45.584
and in her name,
I command you to let the man go.

43:48.170 --> 43:49.796
The witch child of Queen Maghra.

43:51.089 --> 43:54.051
You do understand
we are burning witches here,

43:54.134 --> 43:55.844
not taking orders from them.

43:56.970 --> 43:57.971
Grab her!

43:58.055 --> 43:59.306
I got her!

43:59.389 --> 44:00.432
Please, please.

44:01.683 --> 44:03.227
Eyes! Take her eyes!

44:03.310 --> 44:06.396
In the name of the God Flame
and all that is holy,

44:06.480 --> 44:08.607
we send your corrupt soul

44:08.690 --> 44:10.442
back to the devil himself!

44:25.582 --> 44:27.167
Stay back! Haniwa!

44:28.502 --> 44:29.586
I'm here.

44:31.129 --> 44:32.256
I see you!

44:32.923 --> 44:34.258
I see all of you!

44:35.551 --> 44:36.885
You'll pay for this!

44:38.345 --> 44:42.099
Reports are coming in from the border.
I will keep the military on high alert.

44:42.182 --> 44:44.977
Our concerns are justified,
Captain Gosset.

44:45.561 --> 44:48.021
How do we know that handing
the Trivantians Sibeth's head

44:48.105 --> 44:49.231
will guarantee the peace?

44:49.314 --> 44:52.067
This is Trivantes we speak of.

44:52.150 --> 44:53.277
There's no reason to believe

44:53.360 --> 44:55.279
the Trivantians
will go back on their word.

44:55.362 --> 44:56.947
You cannot be certain of that.

44:57.030 --> 45:00.284
No, but I know what happens
for certain if we decline.

45:00.367 --> 45:03.537
I've spent the past months
haggling with Ambassador Trovere,

45:03.620 --> 45:05.289
and I believe her to be truthful.

45:05.372 --> 45:06.456
And if you're wrong?

45:06.540 --> 45:09.334
We have increased production
on Lord Harlan's orders.

45:09.418 --> 45:11.920
If the truce fails,
we will be ready for the armories.

45:12.838 --> 45:16.133
I have received word that
Ambassador Trovere will be arriving soon.

45:16.633 --> 45:17.801
How soon?

45:17.885 --> 45:20.596
Her delegation should be at the city gates
by the rise of the God Flame.

45:20.679 --> 45:22.472
-What?
-They're moving swiftly.

45:23.015 --> 45:24.183
Maybe it's a good sign.

45:24.266 --> 45:26.935
The Trivantians are not
the only danger we face.

45:27.019 --> 45:29.771
There are reports of religious riots
on an almost daily basis now.

45:31.523 --> 45:33.942
Your Majesty's continued support
of the queen's edict on sight

45:34.026 --> 45:35.277
continues to divide the people.

45:35.360 --> 45:38.864
Why are we listening to this commoner?
He shouldn't even be here.

45:38.947 --> 45:42.492
He serves, as you do,
at the pleasure of the queen.

45:42.576 --> 45:45.537
Why don't we just put some Trivantians
on the council?

45:45.621 --> 45:49.124
They'd likely be more productive
than certain entitled Payans.

45:49.208 --> 45:50.209
Lord Harlan--

45:50.292 --> 45:51.460
Don't forget,

45:51.960 --> 45:55.964
it was Queen Maghra who negotiated this
peace when none was thought possible.

45:56.048 --> 46:00.385
And do I really need to remind you
that nine months ago,

46:00.469 --> 46:04.348
Lady Benik,
our people were dying on the battlefield,

46:04.431 --> 46:07.601
and it's only thanks to the wisdom
and skill of this queen

46:07.684 --> 46:09.978
that we're not all slaves now.

46:10.729 --> 46:14.399
We have a Trivantian problem.
We have a local problem.

46:14.942 --> 46:17.778
Sibeth's death will solve the first.

46:18.612 --> 46:20.113
I'll deal with the second.

46:20.197 --> 46:23.116
Killing Sibeth is more dangerous
than you might think.

46:23.909 --> 46:26.453
Some people still believe in her prophecy.

46:26.537 --> 46:28.872
Her death could martyr her
and cause an uprising.

46:29.373 --> 46:31.959
Queen Maghra, do you have no opinion?

46:32.584 --> 46:35.546
You have not spoken
since the council came to session.

46:40.551 --> 46:42.135
I am sorry if it takes me a moment

46:42.219 --> 46:44.763
to figure out
how to best kill my own sister.

46:45.931 --> 46:48.934
We merely have to let the people
think Sibeth died of complications

46:49.017 --> 46:50.227
from childbirth.

46:50.310 --> 46:54.231
Some already know she survived the birth.
The truth will come out.

46:54.314 --> 46:56.191
First rule of government, Torrance.

46:56.275 --> 46:59.319
Tell a lie enough times,
it becomes fact to the people.

47:00.737 --> 47:04.950
If we don't make peace with Trivantes,
it won't matter what our people think.

47:05.033 --> 47:06.243
They'll be dead.

47:08.829 --> 47:10.956
My sister got us into this war.

47:11.832 --> 47:15.961
If giving them her head will get us
out of it, then I must consider it.

47:16.044 --> 47:18.297
-Your Highness--
-I said I will consider it.

47:18.380 --> 47:19.882
This council is adjourned.

47:44.323 --> 47:45.949
There's something you need to know.

47:48.744 --> 47:51.246
The Trivantians want a public trial.

47:52.956 --> 47:56.710
I don't know. The Triangle need
to declare some kind of victory here.

47:58.795 --> 48:00.130
They want her alive?

48:02.132 --> 48:03.133
Yeah.

48:04.593 --> 48:06.678
They will spend years torturing her.

48:07.846 --> 48:09.056
Most likely.

48:11.558 --> 48:14.728
Consider the alternative.
There might not be another way.

48:22.736 --> 48:24.071
It seems to me

48:24.988 --> 48:28.408
you're waiting for an act of God
to take the decision away from you.

48:30.536 --> 48:35.832
But maybe it was that act of God
that put you in this spot to begin with.

48:41.171 --> 48:43.841
It would be a grave error
to go to war for this.

48:46.009 --> 48:48.387
I think you know in your heart
what needs to be done.

48:50.180 --> 48:51.181
Yes.

48:54.518 --> 48:56.562
There's no need for you
to be directly involved.

48:56.645 --> 48:58.814
I'll handle Trovere and the delivery.

49:00.524 --> 49:02.109
I'll let you know when it's done.

49:04.862 --> 49:07.447
I wanted so badly not to be like her.

49:17.666 --> 49:19.126
You're nothing like her.

50:06.340 --> 50:08.675
Ambassador Trovere, welcome back.

50:09.176 --> 50:10.302
Lord Harlan.

50:11.053 --> 50:14.056
I assume your people know by now
where to set up camp.

50:14.139 --> 50:16.683
You will wanna wash up, get some rest.

50:16.767 --> 50:19.645
Where's the queen?
Will she not be greeting me?

50:19.728 --> 50:24.107
The queen has entrusted me
with the resolution of this matter.

50:25.484 --> 50:26.568
Has she now?

50:28.570 --> 50:29.696
Yes, she has.

50:30.572 --> 50:31.615
How exciting.

50:32.783 --> 50:34.201
And is it resolved?

50:35.327 --> 50:36.995
I'll have it resolved by dinner.

50:37.079 --> 50:41.375
Well, then, I'm very much
anticipating our dinner.

50:43.418 --> 50:44.545
As am I.

50:49.007 --> 50:50.175
Set up camp!

50:52.886 --> 50:53.887
Fall out!

51:17.661 --> 51:20.038
-Ready for this?
-Stupid question.

51:20.122 --> 51:22.040
Right. Make way.

51:23.750 --> 51:25.460
Stand down, Tamacti Jun.

51:25.544 --> 51:28.589
Yes, Tamacti Jun. Do stand down.

51:29.464 --> 51:31.258
Don't worry about the nasty man.

51:31.341 --> 51:35.512
He may make some scary noises,
but he's empty inside. Weak and hollow.

51:35.596 --> 51:37.014
I'd be quiet, Sibeth.

51:37.097 --> 51:39.349
Maghra? What are you doing here?

51:39.433 --> 51:42.728
I don't know exactly,
but we will not be handing her over today.

51:43.437 --> 51:45.689
You would defend her
at the cost of your own kingdom?

51:45.772 --> 51:46.773
It's not her kingdom.

51:46.857 --> 51:49.359
A queen who gives away her own sister
in the name of peace

51:49.443 --> 51:51.653
will appear weak and desperate.

51:51.737 --> 51:53.363
Not this sister.

51:54.156 --> 51:55.782
Poor Tamacti Jun.

51:56.408 --> 51:59.286
He'll have to take his revenge
some other day.

52:01.955 --> 52:03.248
Let me take her.

52:04.708 --> 52:05.709
Please.

52:07.544 --> 52:08.587
I'm sorry.

52:12.216 --> 52:14.843
Maghra,
I do believe your general is sulking.

52:24.353 --> 52:25.938
You think I'm making a mistake?

52:26.438 --> 52:27.564
You know me.

52:28.065 --> 52:31.151
Enormous changes at the last minute
are my stock-in-trade.

52:32.903 --> 52:33.904
Thank you.

52:35.113 --> 52:36.281
That said,

52:37.324 --> 52:40.494
we do now find ourselves
in something of a predicament.

52:43.163 --> 52:47.543
I know the ambassador
is more than a little fond of you.

52:54.675 --> 52:56.426
Yeah, it seemsâ€¦

52:57.553 --> 53:00.097
she's not completely immune to my charms.

53:03.183 --> 53:06.228
Well, then, you'll have to be
exceedingly charming.

54:01.200 --> 54:03.493
You have been here for two days.
Don't you have somewhere to be?

54:03.577 --> 54:04.661
Don't you?

54:07.331 --> 54:09.124
I'm no longer needed.

54:09.750 --> 54:11.585
Your family will always need you, Baba.

54:12.252 --> 54:13.712
We will not talk about that, Lion.

54:13.795 --> 54:15.672
Then let's talk about something else.

54:15.756 --> 54:18.842
The tribes answered your call
to fight at Greenhill Gap.

54:18.926 --> 54:21.011
Now there are many orphans
without a parent

54:21.094 --> 54:22.930
to teach them how to hunt and track.

54:23.013 --> 54:24.014
No one to guide them.

54:25.474 --> 54:28.352
I have spent enough time
raising other men's children.

54:29.019 --> 54:30.145
Baba?

54:30.771 --> 54:32.773
Bow Lion, go home!

54:38.862 --> 54:39.988
What is that?

54:45.744 --> 54:46.828
We're not alone.

54:46.912 --> 54:48.372
Baba?

54:49.998 --> 54:51.166
Baba Voss?

54:53.001 --> 54:54.169
Do you know him?

54:55.712 --> 54:57.214
Baba Voss!

54:58.799 --> 54:59.800
Hello?

55:01.218 --> 55:02.469
Are you there?

55:02.970 --> 55:04.847
I'm not really asking.

55:06.640 --> 55:08.058
I know you're there.

55:08.767 --> 55:11.687
Our trackers followed your friend
from the tribes.

55:12.229 --> 55:13.230
What?

55:13.897 --> 55:14.898
Baba--

55:15.816 --> 55:20.320
Did you really think we'd let the murder
of Edo go unpunished?

55:20.404 --> 55:23.282
Give me the butcher.
Grab your staff. We fight.

55:23.365 --> 55:24.867
He was not my brother,

55:26.118 --> 55:27.828
but I loved him like one.

55:27.911 --> 55:30.956
And it is that love that brings me here,

55:31.540 --> 55:33.208
to the brother who killed him,

55:33.834 --> 55:37.379
to end your life
and bring peace to his spirit.

55:38.422 --> 55:41.300
I can't hear you. You should come closer.

55:43.343 --> 55:45.429
I'm closer than you think, Baba.

55:45.929 --> 55:49.224
And you, you're already dead.

55:50.225 --> 55:52.728
You just haven't the sense
to lie down yet.

55:52.811 --> 55:56.899
You killed your father,
and now your brother.

55:57.524 --> 56:01.695
Tell me, is there anyone in your family
you haven't killed?

56:02.779 --> 56:03.822
Your wife?

56:05.115 --> 56:06.533
Your children?

56:07.951 --> 56:12.998
As you are but moments
from your own messy deathâ€¦

56:15.334 --> 56:16.335
I give you my word.

56:16.418 --> 56:21.048
I will track them down
and cut their throats on your behalf.

56:23.717 --> 56:25.260
Lion!
