[dramatic music]

00:06.876 --> 00:08.660
â™ª

00:08.704 --> 00:09.705
- Here we go!

00:09.748 --> 00:11.576
- Here we go, brother.
You ready?

00:11.620 --> 00:13.187
- Oh, I have not
eaten since Tuesday.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.841
Ooh, are these your famous
Whoa Mama cakes?

00:15.885 --> 00:17.582
- Good enough to make
your mama say "whoa"

00:17.626 --> 00:18.844
because
you slapped your uncle.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.194
[Randall laughs]

00:22.413 --> 00:24.154
both: Mm.

00:24.198 --> 00:26.374
- Mm!
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:26.417 --> 00:31.031
both: Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm,
mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:31.074 --> 00:33.511
[laughter]
- Mm.

00:33.555 --> 00:36.079
You know, I'm kinda surprised
we're doing this.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.341
I mean, the election's
a couple days away

00:37.385 --> 00:38.908
and I know you got
your hands full

00:38.951 --> 00:40.388
with the Dr. Julien situation.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.694
- Yeah, but Randall, this
is the best time to do this.

00:42.738 --> 00:45.262
You want to have a cheat day
when the pressure is high,

00:45.306 --> 00:46.524
so you could blow off steam,

00:46.568 --> 00:47.873
otherwise you're just
gonna blow.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.528
You know, this reminds me
of that time in Hawaii

00:50.572 --> 00:52.182
when my grandmother
put my mom in charge

00:52.226 --> 00:53.401
of running her business.

00:53.444 --> 00:55.881
My mom was overseeing
a huge live event

00:55.925 --> 00:57.361
that my dad was a part of,

00:57.405 --> 01:00.147
and it put him
in a high-pressure situation.

01:00.190 --> 01:01.539
all: Tony! Tony! Tony!

01:01.583 --> 01:02.714
- Dad!

01:02.758 --> 01:04.064
- Wait, how did we get here?
- Sorry.

01:04.107 --> 01:05.326
Let's go back a few days.

01:05.369 --> 01:06.544
- Mean Gene Okerlund here

01:06.588 --> 01:08.764
for Polynesian Pacific
Pro Wrestling.

01:08.807 --> 01:12.159
The Backyard Brawl-B-Q
is only days away.

01:12.202 --> 01:14.161
Aloha Stadium is sold out,

01:14.204 --> 01:16.163
and as we've seen
over the past few weeks,

01:16.206 --> 01:17.642
this island is too small

01:17.686 --> 01:20.254
to contain these behemoths
of wrestling.

01:20.297 --> 01:22.169
Tensions boiled over
at the airport...

01:22.212 --> 01:24.823
- My luggage!
- All tighty whities.

01:24.867 --> 01:26.129
- The radio station...

01:26.173 --> 01:29.437
- Rocky does the work,
Tony gets the credit.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.829
- The parking lot...

01:30.873 --> 01:32.918
[tires squeal]

01:32.962 --> 01:35.486
- [chuckles]
Too slow, Andre!

01:35.530 --> 01:37.967
- You make big mistake,
Little John Studd!

01:38.533 --> 01:43.103
- [echoing]
I'll get you, Andre!

01:43.146 --> 01:44.365
- The beaches weren't safe...

01:44.408 --> 01:46.236
[light rock playing on radio]

01:46.280 --> 01:48.151
- I hate light rock!

01:48.195 --> 01:50.327
- Death to FM radio!

01:50.371 --> 01:52.329
- And it was only of time

01:52.373 --> 01:54.940
before a wrestler
took things too far.

01:54.984 --> 01:56.246
- Hey Jake, where's your snake?

01:56.290 --> 01:57.247
- At home, resting.

01:57.291 --> 01:58.988
- Oh, she's resting!

01:59.031 --> 02:00.685
[sizzling]
Resting in pieces!

02:00.729 --> 02:03.906
[Sgt. Slaughter laughs]
- Desdemona! No!

02:03.949 --> 02:07.083
[rowdy rock music]

02:07.127 --> 02:08.737
- Not since Mauna Loa erupted

02:08.780 --> 02:12.915
has an event so epic
occurred on Hawaiian soil.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.482
- Everything's coming together!

02:14.525 --> 02:16.527
All my storylines are peaking
for the Brawl-B-Q!

02:16.571 --> 02:18.312
- Is the snake gonna be okay?

02:18.355 --> 02:20.270
- Oh honey,
it wasn't a real snake.

02:20.314 --> 02:21.489
It was just ground beef

02:21.532 --> 02:22.794
formed into a tube
with some food coloring.

02:22.838 --> 02:25.232
- Hey, who brought
guava juice in here?

02:25.275 --> 02:27.973
- Ugh.
Dad, it's just liquid fruit.

02:28.017 --> 02:31.977
- It's two days before a match.
No sugar in the house.

02:32.021 --> 02:33.631
- Uh!
- Dad!

02:33.675 --> 02:35.633
You know, my dad was
always strict with his diet.

02:35.677 --> 02:37.200
Especially before a big match.
- Mm.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.767
- He had trouble
with impulse control,

02:38.810 --> 02:41.726
so he banned all unhealthy food
from our house.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.646
- Babe, you okay?

02:48.690 --> 02:50.387
Are you still upset
about your call with Vince?

02:50.431 --> 02:52.041
- You mean when
he told me I was destined

02:52.084 --> 02:53.303
to be tag team partners
with Tony

02:53.347 --> 02:54.478
for the rest of my life?

02:54.522 --> 02:56.001
[laughing]
No!

02:56.045 --> 02:57.394
Why would that upset me?

02:57.438 --> 02:58.787
- Meanwhile,

02:58.830 --> 03:00.136
I was dealing with
a new dynamic at school.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.137
[school bell rings]

03:01.181 --> 03:02.573
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:02.617 --> 03:04.184
I'd gotten
friendzoned by Debbie Rose,

03:04.227 --> 03:07.230
but that wound up having
some unexpected benefits.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.884
- Hey Dewey.
Sarah likes you.

03:08.927 --> 03:10.755
- I thought Sarah was
with Julien.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.235
- No, they're done.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.802
She heard you
respected Debbie Rose

03:13.845 --> 03:15.760
and she wants
to be respected too.

03:15.804 --> 03:16.848
So do you like her?

03:16.892 --> 03:18.241
Before you answer,

03:18.285 --> 03:20.200
you should know,
I like you too.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.418
My name's Cam.

03:21.462 --> 03:23.246
Don't tell Sarah.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.900
- Cam and Sarah are so rude,

03:24.943 --> 03:26.467
putting you on the spot
like that.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.251
I'm here if you need to talk.
I'm Bethany.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.384
Like the city of Albany,
but Beth.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.951
- If Bethany was just
trash-talking Cam and Sarah,

03:32.995 --> 03:34.257
don't listen.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.867
She's saying that
just because she likes you.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.782
- Wait.
Bethany likes me now, too?

03:37.826 --> 03:38.957
- Uh-huh.

03:39.001 --> 03:40.916
Cam loves you,
Sarah's kinda into you,

03:40.959 --> 03:44.267
Bethany likes you,
and Emily wants you.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.312
- Who's Emily?

03:45.355 --> 03:48.010
- Me.

03:48.053 --> 03:50.230
Try that on.
Walk around.

03:50.273 --> 03:51.448
See how you feel.

03:51.492 --> 03:54.669
And just so you know,
I'm very jealous.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.019
- Hands off Sarah!

03:57.062 --> 03:58.716
We're going though
something right now,

03:58.760 --> 04:01.632
but she loves me
and we're working it out.

04:02.459 --> 04:05.419
- Ugh, Julien.
- The literal worst.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.377
- The prosecution
in the Lia Maivia trial

04:07.421 --> 04:08.726
is expected to close tomorrow

04:08.770 --> 04:10.728
with their star witness,
Greg Yao,

04:10.772 --> 04:12.774
who's currently
under FBI protection.

04:12.817 --> 04:13.644
- Hmph.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.211
- Could his testimony

04:15.255 --> 04:17.431
prove to be the nail
in the coffin for Lia Maivia?

04:17.474 --> 04:19.259
- When was that picture taken?

04:19.302 --> 04:20.912
- My white lawyer staged it.

04:20.956 --> 04:23.654
I don't know who the baby is.
I didn't ask.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.613
- What on Earth?
- Huh?

04:29.094 --> 04:30.574
What do you want, Yao?

04:30.618 --> 04:33.011
- [laughs]
You like my mirror?

04:33.055 --> 04:34.535
Kristen left it in my car!

04:34.578 --> 04:36.450
I just wanted
to with you a good night

04:36.493 --> 04:39.191
before I send you
to the electric chair tomorrow!

04:39.235 --> 04:40.323
[laughs]

04:40.367 --> 04:41.803
- Mr. Yao,

04:41.846 --> 04:43.108
you're not supposed to be
fraternizing with Lia Maivia.

04:43.152 --> 04:44.762
- FBI!
[laughs]

04:44.806 --> 04:46.373
They're putting me up
in a hotel tonight

04:46.416 --> 04:49.376
where I'll dream of all the
wrestlers I'll steal from you.

04:49.419 --> 04:53.510
The Samoans,
Macho Man, the Big French!

04:53.554 --> 04:58.602
They'll all work for me!
[laughs]

04:58.646 --> 05:00.604
- Don't let
that idiot get to you.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.780
We put a plan in motion,
and it's going to work.

05:02.824 --> 05:05.653
- Yes, Bob said
everything is taken care of.

05:05.696 --> 05:09.309
I hope this works, High Chief.
- Me too, Dad.

05:11.876 --> 05:12.094
.

05:12.137 --> 05:13.922
all: Tony! Tony! Tony!

05:13.965 --> 05:15.227
- What's going on?
Where's he going?

05:15.271 --> 05:17.404
- Is Rocky abandoning
his partner mid-match?

05:17.447 --> 05:19.449
- I think he's lost his head,
Pat.

05:19.493 --> 05:21.190
- Wait, wait, wait.
You jumped ahead again.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.800
- [chuckling]
Apologies.

05:22.844 --> 05:25.281
It's hard for me to focus when
Unagi prepared in the style

05:25.325 --> 05:27.283
of the Kansai region
is in front of me.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.546
- See, I'm a tamago man.
Sweet egg all day.

05:29.590 --> 05:30.852
- Ah.
- [laughs]

05:30.895 --> 05:34.290
- So Rocky left Tony
during the cage match?

05:34.334 --> 05:36.118
- Well, let me give you
a little context there.

05:36.161 --> 05:37.815
The big match was
still days away

05:37.859 --> 05:39.643
and my mom took the family
out to dinner.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.166
- I called all the guys today,

05:41.210 --> 05:43.343
made sure they knew their
storylines for the Brawl-B-Q.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.780
- Babe, you're gonna
put on an event for the ages!

05:45.823 --> 05:48.348
[both chuckle]

05:49.000 --> 05:51.612
- Hey!
- Oh, what's Tony doing here?

05:51.655 --> 05:53.701
- Soul Patrol has a
huge storyline tomorrow night.

05:53.744 --> 05:56.704
I need you both to be focused
and on the same page.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.358
- Apparently I'll be
working with him

05:58.401 --> 06:01.404
for the rest of my career,
so why not add in another meal?

06:01.448 --> 06:04.451
Tony!
- Hey, brother. Hey, Ata.

06:04.494 --> 06:05.539
- Hi, Tony!

06:05.582 --> 06:06.714
- Dewey!
What's shakin', little man?

06:06.757 --> 06:08.977
- A lot, actually.
Four girls like me.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.370
- Four?
- [chuckles]

06:10.413 --> 06:12.415
- This damn kid's
swimmin' in--

06:12.459 --> 06:13.808
- Uh.
- Uh.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.549
- Hands to hold.

06:15.592 --> 06:17.594
[soft piano music]

06:17.638 --> 06:19.335
- Listen, next time you
with the girls,

06:19.379 --> 06:21.032
you just take a look
at their feet.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.817
That'll tell you
everything you need to know.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.253
- Their feet?

06:24.296 --> 06:27.082
- You set your peepers
on what's in their sneakers.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.910
- Uh, what's--
what are you two talking about?

06:28.953 --> 06:30.346
- Nothin'.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.131
- Seems like a good time
to go to the men's room.

06:33.958 --> 06:35.830
- Oh, there it is.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.875
- You eat cake before a match?

06:37.919 --> 06:40.095
Dad doesn't even
let us have guava juice.

06:40.138 --> 06:42.184
- You gotta have cake
every now and then, dude.

06:42.227 --> 06:44.491
It's good for the brain.
Come on, take a fork.

06:44.534 --> 06:46.884
- When Tony Atlas said,
"You gotta eat cake!"

06:46.928 --> 06:49.887
At that time, I didn't know
what he meant, but I do now.

06:49.931 --> 06:52.020
Don't cheat yourself,
treat yourself.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.674
- Mm, that's a
perfect cheat day mantra.

06:53.717 --> 06:56.677
If I wasn't busy eating okra,
I'd write that down.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.418
[both chuckle]

06:58.461 --> 07:00.289
- Unfortunately, that was not
something my dad understood.

07:00.332 --> 07:04.162
- Son, what are you doin'?
No cake before a big match.

07:04.206 --> 07:06.513
- Aw, come on Rock.
He ain't doin' wrestling.

07:07.905 --> 07:08.993
Let the boy enjoy himself.

07:09.037 --> 07:13.476
â™ª

07:13.520 --> 07:15.696
- You want to eat
that piece of cake, Dewey?

07:15.739 --> 07:16.784
Go ahead.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.220
Ah-ah!

07:18.263 --> 07:20.962
But before you do,
let me ask you one question.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.355
Do you have standards
for yourself?

07:24.705 --> 07:26.271
- Um, yeah?

07:26.315 --> 07:28.622
- You see us wrestlers,
we live by a code:

07:28.665 --> 07:31.451
what we will do
and what we won't do.

07:31.494 --> 07:34.671
When your standards start
to slip, you get sloppy.

07:34.715 --> 07:38.632
And when wrestlers get sloppy,
bad things happen.

07:38.675 --> 07:42.984
â™ª

07:43.027 --> 07:46.509
You still want a bite
of that cake?

07:46.553 --> 07:48.903
- I did not take a bite
of that cake.

07:48.946 --> 07:50.078
- I mean,
your dad made a good point.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.427
- He did, no doubt,

07:51.471 --> 07:53.516
and it's important
to live by a code,

07:53.560 --> 07:55.736
but he put so much pressure
on himself

07:55.779 --> 07:59.000
that he didn't need to
and he was bound to blow.

07:59.043 --> 08:00.436
But we're not there yet.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.527
- Pasta with butter.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.615
And a diet coke.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.357
- Diet coke?

08:09.532 --> 08:10.968
- The Big French.

08:11.012 --> 08:14.189
- Are you pregnant?
- No, just have an early night.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.757
Have to be in court
by 8:00 a.m.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.106
For Lia's trial?

08:18.149 --> 08:20.108
- It's not looking good
for her, no?

08:20.151 --> 08:22.458

on Rocky's forehead!

17:24.739 --> 17:25.914
He's bleeding badly.

17:25.957 --> 17:27.394
- This is what Dad was
worried about.

17:27.437 --> 17:29.309
Tony got sloppy.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.443

17:33.487 --> 17:35.837
and he's putting the fist
to Rowdy Roddie Piper.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.795
- What a masterful work

17:37.839 --> 17:41.582
by the Soul Patrol
in this cage match!

They're throwing him

We're finally here.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.726
We're back where we started!
- Yes, we are.

Where's he going?

18:15.964 --> 18:18.140
- Is Rocky abandoning
his partner mid-match?

18:18.184 --> 18:21.056
- I think he's lost his head,
Pat.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.623

20:14.996 --> 20:16.476
Did he really cut Rocky
by accident?

- Oh, no.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.305
It's called "getting color"

You just a take razor blade

My dad didn't do it that often,

20:24.005 --> 20:25.963
but my mom had
set up the tension so well

20:26.007 --> 20:27.400
between my dad and Tony

20:27.443 --> 20:29.358
that they both agreed
it would help get him over.

20:29.402 --> 20:31.882
- Mm. Rocky must've felt like
he was on top of the world.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.449
- [inhales deeply]
He did.

with adulation is

20:35.799 --> 20:36.800
it makes you want more.

Hey, Frankie!
Let's steam up some cod!

about my dad's issues
