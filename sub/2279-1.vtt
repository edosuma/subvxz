23:27.239 --> 23:29.490
You got a problem with me, man?

23:34.371 --> 23:37.915
Hey, hey. Hey, l'm talking to you.
You got a fucking problem with me, man?

23:38.083 --> 23:40.626
Why don't you shut the fuck up already?

23:42.337 --> 23:45.005
Oh, l'm sorry,
l didn't hear what you said...

23:45.173 --> 23:47.842
...because, my hearing,
sometimes it comes and goes.

23:48.009 --> 23:49.218
What was that?

23:49.386 --> 23:53.556
Fucking Americans, all talk too much.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.810
Now l'm gonna come over this rock,

You fix your fucking mouth
when you talk to me.

24:11.074 --> 24:13.492
What the fuck is this bullshit?

24:42.063 --> 24:44.273
l hope you've enjoyed your first day.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.691
And, now, as promised...

24:45.859 --> 24:48.903
...if any of you would like to train
for tomorrow's first round...

24:49.070 --> 24:50.529
...you have one hour.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.918
l don't know about you right now, man.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.545
lt's showtime.

...you just saw your lights go out.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.159
Bling.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.203
The time will come.

26:00.141 --> 26:01.600
This is for you.

Tell you what l'm gonna do.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.500
When l get that ass--

39:01.005 --> 39:04.466
You need to shut your fucking mouth.

39:07.553 --> 39:08.970

39:09.430 --> 39:10.555
Here it comes.

41:06.046 --> 41:08.381

41:08.549 --> 41:11.843
You know that was some bitch shit

41:12.011 --> 41:14.804
Sneak a nigga when he ain't looking.
That's some bitch shit.

41:14.972 --> 41:18.641
That shit might be cool where you from.
Where l'm from, bitches do that.

41:18.809 --> 41:20.351

unless they have something to say.

41:34.074 --> 41:35.617
Yeah, well....

41:36.577 --> 41:38.495
Just saying
if that's how you gotta win...

41:39.914 --> 41:42.081
...maybe you shouldn't be here.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.543
You hear that?

41:45.794 --> 41:48.755
Maybe your fucking ass
shouldn't be here.

42:12.613 --> 42:13.863
Yo, Russia.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.532
Russia?

42:16.742 --> 42:17.951
l need to take a shit.

42:20.955 --> 42:24.290
Say, man, l need to take a shit,
and l can't find no place to do it.

42:25.626 --> 42:27.961

42:28.546 --> 42:32.173
Fucking need to take a shit,
and l can't find no place to do it, man.

42:33.175 --> 42:35.218
What do you think l should do?

42:37.888 --> 42:40.598
l think you should fucking hang yourself.

42:40.975 --> 42:42.600
Fuck you.

42:45.646 --> 42:48.773
l can't find no place to squat myself.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.209
What the fuck was that?

43:11.463 --> 43:13.006
Russia?

43:14.174 --> 43:16.884
Russia, they've got fucking things
moving in my cell, man.

43:17.052 --> 43:18.720

43:21.515 --> 43:23.308

Seriously.

43:24.935 --> 43:26.060

43:27.229 --> 43:29.772
You can't fucking tell me
your name, man.

43:31.358 --> 43:33.443
You can't fucking tell me
your fucking name?

43:33.611 --> 43:35.320
Fuck you.

43:35.487 --> 43:36.946
l'll fucking talk to myself.

43:37.114 --> 43:40.533
Have a better fucking conversation
anyway, you fake-ass caveman.

43:40.701 --> 43:42.327
Motherfucker.

43:42.494 --> 43:43.911
Fuck.

43:44.079 --> 43:46.998
Somebody let me out this motherfucker!

43:47.833 --> 43:48.916
Fuck.

44:05.434 --> 44:06.517
No, no, no.

44:06.685 --> 44:09.145
We're not gonna wait.
We're gonna see our clients now.

44:09.313 --> 44:11.230
Gaga, please.

44:14.193 --> 44:15.860
See what you could do.

44:17.738 --> 44:19.906
Brings back memories.

44:29.917 --> 44:32.168
lt was a good fight the other day.
How are you?

44:32.628 --> 44:34.045
How am l?

44:35.422 --> 44:36.506
Yes, how are you?

44:38.258 --> 44:39.592
Did you set me up?

44:41.220 --> 44:42.387
What's going on?

44:42.971 --> 44:45.139
What sort of fucking tournament is this?

44:45.307 --> 44:47.517
Boyka, cut to the chase.
What's going on?

44:47.685 --> 44:49.894
We're being forced to do hard labor.

44:50.562 --> 44:53.481
Hard labor?
What the fuck are you talking about?

44:53.649 --> 44:56.067
l'm talking about l'm breaking rocks
with a hammer.

44:56.235 --> 44:57.652
Some fucking chain-gang shit.

44:58.654 --> 45:00.488
Son of a bitch.

45:00.656 --> 45:03.032
Yeah. You gonna do something about it?

45:03.200 --> 45:05.034
Consider it done.

45:05.202 --> 45:08.538
Lying cocksuckers.

45:12.084 --> 45:16.587
l swear to Christ, l'm gonna fucking
clip somebody before this day is over.

45:26.306 --> 45:28.307
- Gentlemen.
- You cocksucker.

45:28.475 --> 45:31.310
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Of course you know Mr. Rezo.

45:34.314 --> 45:35.898
My friends.

45:36.066 --> 45:37.358
You seem agitated.

45:37.526 --> 45:40.278
Agitated?
Why is my fighter doing hard labor?

45:40.446 --> 45:42.905
Because you want him to lose,
of course.

45:43.073 --> 45:44.866
What did you expect?

45:45.033 --> 45:47.618
Did you really think...

45:49.121 --> 45:53.833
...that l would not arrange
for things to go my way?

45:54.001 --> 45:57.420
You motherfucker, you know how much
cash l dropped to get my fighter here?

45:57.588 --> 45:58.755
Of course l do.

45:58.922 --> 46:00.298
l will fucking destroy you.

46:00.466 --> 46:02.383
Okay, perhaps.

46:02.551 --> 46:06.012
Or maybe
there is another way we can go.

46:06.388 --> 46:09.140
Remember what l said at the dinner?

46:09.641 --> 46:14.145
How do we ensure the greatest profit
at the lowest risk?

46:15.147 --> 46:17.607
So my suggestion is this:

46:18.025 --> 46:22.153
Go under your mattresses,
find all the money you can...

46:22.321 --> 46:27.450
...liquefy everything
and put it all on the Colombian.

46:28.202 --> 46:33.956
Do this and you will leave here
richer men than ever you could've dreamed.

46:34.917 --> 46:37.084
- What about our fighters?
- Fuck your fighters.

46:38.295 --> 46:39.378
Fuck our fighters?

46:39.546 --> 46:41.547
They're the weak horses.

46:41.715 --> 46:43.800
We put them down with the rest.

46:45.719 --> 46:49.388
Can you guarantee
that my fighter doesn't win?

46:49.765 --> 46:55.394
This l absolutely guarantee.

47:11.995 --> 47:13.871
Hey. Would you stop pulling?

47:14.039 --> 47:16.332
l'm not pulling.

47:17.084 --> 47:18.918
Yes, you are.

47:21.171 --> 47:23.506
You see me move, you move with me.

47:24.591 --> 47:27.134
l ain't Ginger Rogers,
and your ass ain't Fred Astaire.

47:27.302 --> 47:30.388
Give me a warning,
and l'll move with you.

47:32.099 --> 47:33.140
- Okay.
- Okay.

47:33.308 --> 47:35.017
l'm going to move now.

47:38.063 --> 47:39.564
That's funny, huh?

47:39.731 --> 47:42.275
Wanna do this again?
End up in the motherfucking hole?

47:42.442 --> 47:43.985
ls that what you want?

47:44.152 --> 47:45.778
Sure, it is.

47:45.946 --> 47:46.988
So l'll tell you what.

47:47.155 --> 47:49.240
l want nothing more
but to get into your ass.

47:49.408 --> 47:52.118
But we're gonna do it in a ring
where it matters. Got it?

47:54.329 --> 47:55.788
- Fine.
- Fine.

47:55.956 --> 47:58.124
Uh-- On three.

47:58.292 --> 48:00.960
One, two, three.

48:07.384 --> 48:08.885
You know what?

48:09.052 --> 48:12.138
Where is that Colombian
motherfucker anyway?

48:51.011 --> 48:52.762
Thanks.

48:55.223 --> 48:58.935
So, what did they clip you for?

48:59.102 --> 49:00.895
What? More bread.

49:01.480 --> 49:03.940
What'd they pop you for?
What's your sentence?

49:05.484 --> 49:07.318
l speak English.

49:07.486 --> 49:09.028
Do you?

49:09.655 --> 49:14.951
l was just asking what are you actually
in this motherfucker for?

49:15.410 --> 49:17.495
Committed crime.

49:19.289 --> 49:20.623
You don't wanna talk?

49:20.791 --> 49:21.999
Fine, we ain't gotta talk.

49:22.167 --> 49:25.169
- Talking's bullshit anyway.
- lt's not my strength.

49:25.754 --> 49:27.463
No shit.

49:38.809 --> 49:40.726
You know what's going on, right?

49:40.894 --> 49:42.103
What?

49:42.270 --> 49:44.522
This shit's fixed.

49:45.315 --> 49:46.399
What shit?

49:46.566 --> 49:49.235
This shit. This fucking tournament.

49:49.403 --> 49:52.947
And what's worse is we was fixed
in this fixed motherfucker.

49:53.115 --> 49:56.325
That why the fucking Colombian's
in a cell sipping on pina coladas...

49:56.493 --> 49:58.077
...while we're busting our asses.

49:58.245 --> 49:59.578
Of course.

50:00.163 --> 50:01.580
What do you mean of course?

50:01.748 --> 50:03.874
This is surprise to you?

50:04.042 --> 50:05.918
l came here to win.

50:06.086 --> 50:07.545
So did l .

50:09.756 --> 50:12.425
So this don't piss you off at all?

50:15.554 --> 50:18.139
Winning takes many things.

50:18.306 --> 50:20.558
Who can be the best fighter,
yes, of course.

50:20.726 --> 50:22.977
But most important.. .

50:26.148 --> 50:28.399
...who can survive.

50:31.194 --> 50:32.486
Survive what?

50:38.035 --> 50:40.327
ln here, the people you fight...

50:40.495 --> 50:42.955
...they are not just in the ring.

50:51.006 --> 50:52.882
Hey, come here.

50:53.050 --> 50:54.425
The key.

51:07.564 --> 51:09.148
We can train?

51:14.029 --> 51:15.780
One hour.

51:18.200 --> 51:20.284
Are you fucking crazy?

51:21.286 --> 51:22.995
Fuck that.

51:23.371 --> 51:26.499
l can barely fucking walk. Working out--

51:41.807 --> 51:43.432
ls that all you got?

51:50.357 --> 51:52.566
l'll give you a little test.

52:00.367 --> 52:01.951
Luka, listen to me.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.702
l need you to liquefy the fund.

52:03.870 --> 52:04.912
Yes, all of it.

52:05.539 --> 52:08.165
No, no, no. By tomorrow.

52:08.333 --> 52:11.669
l-- l don't give a flying fuck how.

52:11.837 --> 52:13.671
Send a pigeon if you have to, okay?

52:14.464 --> 52:16.590
l know, Vito.
l know you vouched for me, Vito.

52:16.758 --> 52:20.219
But look, l need another million
like yesterday.

52:20.387 --> 52:22.304
Vito, this is a sure thing. lt's a lock.

52:26.226 --> 52:27.560
Yeah.

52:34.276 --> 52:35.734
Well, well, well.

52:35.902 --> 52:37.361
Look who's here.

52:39.781 --> 52:42.032
What the fuck is he doing here?

52:46.496 --> 52:48.539
Breakfast is over.

52:53.503 --> 52:55.963
This is some fucking bullshit.

52:56.131 --> 52:57.631
lt's a fucking joke.

52:57.799 --> 53:00.176
l'm supposed to fight like this.
They starving me out--

53:00.343 --> 53:01.760
- You curse too much.
- Fuck you.

53:01.928 --> 53:03.179
Then quit.

53:03.346 --> 53:05.723
Go back where you fucking came from.

53:07.058 --> 53:09.059
Maybe we can turn this around.

53:11.438 --> 53:14.899
- What the fuck does that mean?
- We can turn it to our advantage.

53:17.194 --> 53:18.319
lmprovise.

53:18.486 --> 53:19.570
Adapt.

53:19.738 --> 53:21.447
Overcome.

53:21.781 --> 53:24.241
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

53:24.618 --> 53:25.701
How?

53:25.869 --> 53:28.370
We can say this is work.

53:28.914 --> 53:31.248
Or we can say this is training.

53:37.130 --> 53:38.505
One.

53:38.673 --> 53:40.007
Two.

53:40.342 --> 53:41.800
Three.

53:45.388 --> 53:49.266
Six, seven, eight...

53:49.434 --> 53:51.810
...nine, 1 0.

54:26.179 --> 54:27.805
What's wrong with your knee?

54:27.973 --> 54:29.098
l'm fine.

54:29.266 --> 54:31.892
- You don't act like you're fine.
- l said l'm fine.

54:48.493 --> 54:51.578
Squeeze that in your hand.
Take the oil and rub it on your knee.

54:53.790 --> 54:55.207
Do it.

54:56.418 --> 54:57.459
How do you know this?

54:57.627 --> 55:01.630
lmprovise, adapt, overcome.

55:01.881 --> 55:03.632
l know a whole lot of shit, Russia.

55:03.800 --> 55:05.718
l know a whole lot of shit. Now let's go.

55:05.885 --> 55:10.431
Come on.

55:10.849 --> 55:13.475
Three, two....

55:27.282 --> 55:28.824
Children?

55:31.202 --> 55:33.162
You have children?

55:37.751 --> 55:39.168
Yeah.

55:40.879 --> 55:42.421
Boy and a girl.

55:44.674 --> 55:46.008
You?

55:48.720 --> 55:49.762
No.

55:49.929 --> 55:51.680
Ever wanted any?

55:55.226 --> 55:56.268
Never?

55:56.603 --> 55:57.936
No.

55:58.313 --> 56:00.898
- Never wanted a son--
- You ask too many questions.

56:06.363 --> 56:08.614
This is why you want to win?

56:09.032 --> 56:10.574
Children?

56:12.452 --> 56:15.079
l've been locked up for a long time.

56:17.040 --> 56:19.833
l mean, l ain't seen my youngest,
my sweet girl, for... .

56:20.001 --> 56:21.335
Since she was four weeks old.

56:21.503 --> 56:22.753
Water?

56:27.133 --> 56:28.634
What about you?

56:30.929 --> 56:32.388
l have to win.

56:34.641 --> 56:36.308
You have to win.

56:36.476 --> 56:38.519
You would not understand.

56:38.686 --> 56:39.728
Try me.

56:44.651 --> 56:47.611
God has given me a gift.

56:48.029 --> 56:49.071
Only one.

56:51.324 --> 56:54.618
l am the most complete fighter...

56:54.786 --> 56:56.578
...in the world.

56:58.331 --> 57:00.958
My whole life, l've trained.

57:03.002 --> 57:04.711
For what?

57:06.714 --> 57:09.425
l must prove l am worthy of something.

57:11.761 --> 57:13.220
Damn.

57:15.014 --> 57:18.100
l'm gonna feel bad
when l'm whipping that ass.

57:27.193 --> 57:28.986
lt's about time.

57:36.411 --> 57:38.454
l'd like to place a new bet.

57:38.621 --> 57:40.122
Absolutely, Mr. Gaga.

57:59.601 --> 58:02.394
Announcing semifinal first fight...

58:02.562 --> 58:04.396
...for Prison Spetz Competition.

58:04.564 --> 58:05.898
Here.

58:07.150 --> 58:11.320
Our first-round fight
in the semifinal is Boyka of Russia...

58:11.738 --> 58:14.615
...versus Andriago Silva of Brazil.

58:14.782 --> 58:16.283
Are you ready?

58:16.451 --> 58:18.118
Are you ready?

58:18.286 --> 58:19.745
Fight.

58:22.207 --> 58:23.582
Fist.

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:46.558
Stop, stop, enough.

01:00:55.276 --> 01:00:56.985
Good fight.

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:04.368
Winner.

01:01:04.535 --> 01:01:07.079
The first fight of the semifinal.

01:01:07.246 --> 01:01:11.041
The winner is Boyka from Russia.

01:01:30.269 --> 01:01:32.270
l'm worried, Kuss.

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:37.401
That Russian Boyka looks very strong.

01:01:37.568 --> 01:01:39.111
Too strong.

01:01:39.278 --> 01:01:45.784
l can only imagine
that the American will look the same.

01:01:47.328 --> 01:01:50.497
Perhaps your methods...

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.125
...are inadequate.

01:01:53.292 --> 01:01:54.835
l will step up my efforts.

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:07.514
Look, you motherfuckers wanna tell me
what this shit's about?

01:02:07.682 --> 01:02:09.975
l want to talk to you about
your training partner.

01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:13.270
- My who?
- The Russian.

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:16.982
Well, you gonna have to talk to the Russian
about the Russian.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.234
l understand
you two have become sexual.

01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:24.906
What you say? Because sometimes
my hearing comes and goes.

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:27.909
- They say you two are lovers.
- They say?

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:31.329
You should know we don't allow
such perversions in this institution.

01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:34.916
l'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:02:49.807 --> 01:02:51.892
Take him to his cell.

01:03:26.385 --> 01:03:28.053
Hey, hey.

01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:32.098
Hey.

01:03:33.434 --> 01:03:35.018
Russia.

01:03:39.565 --> 01:03:40.899
Hey.

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:45.111
The fucking warden.

01:03:46.864 --> 01:03:48.073
You need doctor.

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:49.908
Fuck that.

01:03:52.411 --> 01:03:54.120
Fucking give them the satisfaction?

01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:56.414
You take care of business.

01:03:56.874 --> 01:03:59.626
You and me,
we got a date in the ring, right?

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:04.506
Right?

01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:27.279
You know, when l was in the hole.. .

01:04:27.446 --> 01:04:33.034
... l remember hearing great stories
about Yuri Boyka.

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:36.621
King of prison fighters.

01:04:37.456 --> 01:04:39.165
l thought he must be... .

01:04:42.753 --> 01:04:45.046
But then he lose.

01:04:45.464 --> 01:04:48.341
He lose to an American boxer.

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:52.095
They say Boyka's a wounded horse now.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:56.266
He's a champion of the toilets.

01:04:59.854 --> 01:05:02.981
lf l'm champion of the toilets...

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:07.193
...what does that make you
when l kick the fucking shit out of you?

01:05:07.653 --> 01:05:09.821
lt's okay, muneco.

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:22.000
Make sure you spend some quality time
with your American boyfriend.

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:24.794
lt will be his last.

01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:39.721
Get them to work.

01:07:44.852 --> 01:07:47.353
How well do you know the forest?

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:50.023
- What?
- Look, it's no time to bullshit me.

01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:52.484
You were military, yes?

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:56.654
Listen to me.

01:07:57.031 --> 01:08:01.326
You will not survive the fight tomorrow,
they will make sure of it.

01:08:04.538 --> 01:08:06.372
l don't give a fuck.

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:10.001
You must give a fuck.

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:22.889
Shit.

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:25.308
These motherfuckers will not break me.

01:08:25.475 --> 01:08:26.725
l'm gonna finish this shit.

01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:28.895
This is not the time.
You must leave here.

01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:31.523
Where the fuck
am l supposed to go, huh?

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:40.323
This will give you a chance.

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:42.783
A chance for what?

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:45.870
Security out here
is not as heavy as it should be.

01:08:46.037 --> 01:08:48.206
No one expects one of us to escape.

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:50.166
We're here to fight.

01:08:50.334 --> 01:08:52.210
l'm going to break your chain.

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:54.921
Make run to the forest.
You know how to survive.

01:08:56.506 --> 01:08:59.801
- So, what, you my guardian angel now?
- l'm no angel.

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:02.804
No. l'm gonna fight this fucking guy.

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:06.349
- Not in your condition, it is not a true test.
- l'm gonna fight.

01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:08.560
There is no honor in it.

01:09:08.727 --> 01:09:10.728
There's no honor in running.

01:09:11.063 --> 01:09:13.731
There's no honor in dying for money.

01:09:14.608 --> 01:09:18.361
Well, l ain't gonna die, okay? Fuck that.

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:21.738
l fucking lose, l just fucking go home.
Back to square one.

01:09:21.907 --> 01:09:27.328
- Do like what l've been doing, fuck.
- No one goes home, not from here.

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:29.997
The losing fighters all disappear.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.419
No one gets out alive.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.465
See?

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.801
You don't have a choice.

01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:46.096
Fuck.

01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:52.770
Okay, all right,
live to fight another day, right?

01:09:53.063 --> 01:09:54.731
- Right.
- Okay.

01:09:54.899 --> 01:09:56.399
Hey.

01:09:56.942 --> 01:09:58.818
They're gonna fucking kill you for this.

01:09:58.986 --> 01:10:02.030
No, they need me to fight.

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:05.116
They will not destroy their final payday.

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:09.662
Russia, why are you doing this?

01:10:11.081 --> 01:10:14.792
Stop asking so many fucking questions.

01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:18.796
Hit it.

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.841
Come on, hit it. Harder.

01:10:22.676 --> 01:10:24.052
Hit it.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:25.595
Hit it again.

01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:28.264
Damn it, hit it. Hit it.

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:29.891
Hit it, damn it, hit it.

01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:00.630
You motherfucker.

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:02.173
l told you, motherfucker.

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:05.927
l told you, motherfucker. l told you.

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:08.471
Never fuck with me.

01:11:56.937 --> 01:11:58.438
Go.

01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:05.153
Go!

01:12:37.061 --> 01:12:42.982
You know, of all the fighters
l expected would give us trouble...

01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:45.151
...you were the last on the list.

01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:49.655
- Where is the American?
- He'll be found and dealt with.

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:55.203
l want to speak to Gaga.

01:12:57.706 --> 01:13:00.458
He has requests now.

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:04.420
Do you think Gaga
or anyone else can help you?

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:10.468
- You think Gaga gives a shit about you?
- He gives a shit about his money.

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:11.761
And that's what l am.

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:15.431
l would not be so sure about that.

01:13:16.683 --> 01:13:17.767
What does that mean?

01:13:18.185 --> 01:13:21.396
lt means there's been a change of plans.

01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:29.487
l made a new wager, Boyka.

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:32.740
Sorry, my friend.

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:36.661
You just can't beat the Colombian,
not with your knee.

01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:38.413
You are with these animals?

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.665
l'm with the money.

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.041
l'm always with the money.

01:13:42.626 --> 01:13:45.837
We have been forced to improvise.

01:13:46.004 --> 01:13:49.799
You will now fight the Colombian
in the final.

01:13:51.385 --> 01:13:54.345
What will ye give me?

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:56.973
And l will deliver him unto you.

01:13:58.517 --> 01:13:59.517
Excuse me.

01:14:01.061 --> 01:14:02.770
You fucking Judas!

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:07.191
Okay. Okay, l'm a fucking Judas.

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:11.028
Now, that makes you what?

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:14.490
- Jesus?
- No.

01:14:15.534 --> 01:14:17.076
That makes me angry.

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:30.423
- Boyka.
- Dolor.

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:39.724
Announcing the championship
final of the Prison Spetz Competition.

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:42.894
Now accepting your bets
from all booking agents...

01:14:43.061 --> 01:14:46.397
...in any currency worldwide.

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:55.823
Ladies and gentlemen, in our final fight.. .

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:57.783
...Boyka of Russia...

01:14:57.951 --> 01:15:03.331
...versus Dolor of Colombia.

01:15:13.258 --> 01:15:14.800
Are you ready?

01:15:14.968 --> 01:15:16.594
Are you ready?

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:18.262
Fight.

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:33.856
- We got him, we got him.
- lt's not over, it's not over.

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:41.656
Look, he's hurt.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:11.519
Ahh. Yes.

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:23.572
Come on, come on, huh?

01:18:35.085 --> 01:18:40.506
Dolor, Dolor, Dolor.

01:18:56.982 --> 01:18:59.942
Dolor, Dolor, Dolor.

01:19:20.505 --> 01:19:26.677
Dolor, Dolor, Dolor.

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:29.430
Dolor, Dolor, Dolor.

01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:51.994
One.

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:57.208
Two.

01:20:01.588 --> 01:20:03.214
Three.

01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:11.722
Four.

01:20:14.267 --> 01:20:16.185
Five.

01:20:16.353 --> 01:20:19.563
He's a champion of the toilets.

01:20:21.107 --> 01:20:22.691
Nice life.

01:20:22.859 --> 01:20:24.527
Six.

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:28.739
lmprovise, adapt, overcome.

01:20:36.414 --> 01:20:37.498
Seven.

01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:41.836
Eight.

01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:52.388
The brave...

01:20:53.306 --> 01:20:54.348
...Boyka.

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:59.019
Huh?

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:15.327
Boyka.

01:21:25.922 --> 01:21:27.673
Bravo.

01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:10.132
Boyka.

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:14.678
- Boyka, Boyka, Boyka.
- Boyka.

01:22:14.846 --> 01:22:17.306
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka.

01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:34.156
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka.

01:23:02.727 --> 01:23:07.606
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka.

01:24:28.146 --> 01:24:31.190
Fuck, it's over.

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:35.152
Stop, stop, stop, stay right there.

01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:01.929
The winner from Russia is Boyka.

01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:09.603
"l guarantee you," huh?
"l absolutely guarantee it."

01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:12.439
You ancient fuck.

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:15.692
You just cost me $5 million, Rezo.

01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:18.070
l'm gonna eat your brain with a spoon.

01:25:18.238 --> 01:25:22.741
You understand me? l'm gonna eat
your fucking brain with a spoon.

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:33.168
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka.

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:45.597
You fucked up.

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:47.766
l don't know how this happened.

01:25:47.934 --> 01:25:49.226
l don't give a rat's ass how.

01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:52.187
All l know, l'm out a shitload of money
that l don't have.

01:25:52.355 --> 01:25:54.314
And you're gonna have
to come up with it.

01:25:58.611 --> 01:25:59.778
Die.

01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:27.973
You did well, Mr. Boyka.

01:26:28.141 --> 01:26:30.767
l don't want your fucking prize.

01:26:30.935 --> 01:26:32.352
Just show me the front door.

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.855
Yes, well, about that....

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:36.148
About what?

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:39.193
l'm afraid we have a problem.

01:26:39.444 --> 01:26:41.486
You see, the agreement
of this tournament...

01:26:41.654 --> 01:26:43.947
...was that one man
would receive his freedom.

01:26:47.076 --> 01:26:49.328
You're talking about agreements now?

01:26:49.913 --> 01:26:52.706
Unfortunately,
we have not recovered the American.

01:26:53.291 --> 01:26:55.709
And since you're responsible
for his escape...

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:59.421
... l'm afraid you have forfeited your chance
to leave here a free man.

01:26:59.923 --> 01:27:03.759
Anyway,
you're not walking free out of this facility.

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:07.262
lndeed, you're going right back
to the toilet you came from.

01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:13.477
l did what l had to do.

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:18.649
Where l go now...

01:27:19.859 --> 01:27:21.151
... l don't care.

01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:26.156
Good, then you'll not annoy me
with any resistance.

01:27:26.616 --> 01:27:28.659
A bus is waiting outside.

01:27:49.347 --> 01:27:53.308
l will give you this, you're quite a fighter.

01:27:53.768 --> 01:27:55.852
Quite a fighter.

01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:58.647
Too bad you're such damaged goods.

01:27:58.815 --> 01:28:01.566
l have already arranged
to have you picked up.

01:28:01.734 --> 01:28:02.985
Pity about your freedom.

01:28:03.903 --> 01:28:05.529
This is my freedom.

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:30.262
You fucked with the wrong nigga.

01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:36.310
Let's go.

01:28:37.437 --> 01:28:38.895
Why did you do this?

01:28:39.063 --> 01:28:42.899
Stop asking so many fucking questions.

01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:45.319
Where are we going?

01:28:47.238 --> 01:28:49.323
God, it's good.

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:00.459
Open it.

01:29:00.626 --> 01:29:02.419
Go ahead, open it.

01:29:06.049 --> 01:29:07.883
lt's your share.

01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:10.594
l put all my money on you.

01:29:10.762 --> 01:29:13.472
Oh, you know me, l'm all about money.

01:29:13.639 --> 01:29:19.019
And you,
well, good knee, bad knee, no knee...

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:22.689
...you're still the best fighter in the world,
especially when you're angry.

01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:27.611
Heh, heh. Fuck cholesterol,
winning makes me hungry.

01:29:28.905 --> 01:29:31.823
You're a free man now. How does it feel?

01:29:35.745 --> 01:29:39.164
- You're going with him?
- Yeah.

01:29:39.582 --> 01:29:42.501
- And your children?
- Heh. Yeah.

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.130
l must go. Stop the car.

01:29:48.591 --> 01:29:50.133
Okay.

01:29:58.142 --> 01:30:00.644
Yo, yo, yo, Russia, Russia, Russia.

01:30:04.148 --> 01:30:06.316
Look, you ain't got to thank me.

01:30:06.943 --> 01:30:08.735
Hell, l owed you.

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:11.363
- You didn't owe me.
- Yeah, l did.

01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:15.575
Where l'm from, there ain't shit for free.

01:30:16.828 --> 01:30:19.996
And where l'm from,
everything was for free.

01:30:20.164 --> 01:30:22.416
And it was all shit.

01:30:24.168 --> 01:30:25.877
Any idea where you're gonna go, man?

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:31.425
Mr. Turbo, l'm waiting.

01:30:32.885 --> 01:30:34.970
Look, l better get out of here.

01:30:36.055 --> 01:30:37.806
See you around, buddy.

01:30:38.975 --> 01:30:40.058

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:45.272
My first name, it's Yuri.

01:30:51.404 --> 01:30:53.029
Jericho.

01:30:53.406 --> 01:30:56.074
- Jericho?
- Yeah.

01:30:56.701 --> 01:30:57.784
l know, it's shit, huh?

01:30:58.327 --> 01:30:59.661
Heh.

01:31:01.205 --> 01:31:03.707
You bring down the walls.

01:31:08.463 --> 01:31:10.088
lt's a good name.

01:31:12.592 --> 01:31:14.050
Yeah.

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:17.679
l guess today it is.

01:31:21.893 --> 01:31:22.934
My man.

01:31:26.272 --> 01:31:31.193
Oh, almost forgot, you and me,
we got some unfinished business.

01:31:33.946 --> 01:31:36.072
- Our fight?
- You bet your ass.

01:31:37.783 --> 01:31:40.202
- Next time.
- Yeah, next time, next time, let's go.

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:47.250
Next time, brother, you and me.
