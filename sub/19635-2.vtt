00:01.000 --> 00:02.518
<i>Previously on Broadchurch...</i>

00:02.519 --> 00:04.078
Hi. Trish, is it?

00:04.078 --> 00:07.199
You called about an attack?
A sexual attack?

00:07.200 --> 00:09.158
Trish Winterman of West Flintcombe

00:09.159 --> 00:12.518
has made an allegation of rape
against an unknown attacker.

00:12.519 --> 00:14.359
If the attack happened at the party

00:14.360 --> 00:16.359
that's a long list of people
to interview and eliminate.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.199
There were 50 men at
your party Saturday night?

00:18.200 --> 00:20.199
- Yeah, at least 50.
- Wessex Police.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.399
- Who are you?
- Ed Burnett. This is my shop.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.038
Was there a fight at the party?

00:24.039 --> 00:25.958
Yeah. Bloody Ed.
He was as much at fault as Jim.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.799
And don't let him tell you otherwise.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.839
We have a sexual predator
who's a danger to the public.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:56.000 --> 00:58.958
- How long have you been here?
- Hour or two.

00:58.959 --> 01:01.158
I wanted to familiarise
myself with the scene

01:01.159 --> 01:02.999
before the gold meeting.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.158
I've walked the path
from here to the house

01:05.159 --> 01:08.118
and there are plenty of places
her attacker could have hidden.

01:08.119 --> 01:10.799
But because of the rains
last week, it's all muddy,

01:10.800 --> 01:12.478
so whoever did move her here,

01:12.479 --> 01:14.478
they'd have plenty of mud
on their clothes and shoes.

01:14.479 --> 01:16.319
I'm hoping these guys
get some good footprints.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.000
How many extra officers have we got?

01:22.439 --> 01:24.958
Two DCs.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.758
What? That's it?

01:26.759 --> 01:28.438
We need more than that.

01:28.439 --> 01:31.800
Sexual offences never get
the same resources as murder.

01:34.079 --> 01:36.199
Chief super told me
I was lucky to get two.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.038
For God's sake!

01:38.039 --> 01:39.518
They know how many potential
suspects we've got.

01:39.519 --> 01:41.318
How do they expect us to move quickly

01:41.319 --> 01:42.839
with a small team like that?

01:45.479 --> 01:47.078
Did you get any sleep?

01:47.079 --> 01:48.839
Not really.

02:16.519 --> 02:19.318
Trish Winterman
did not see her attacker.

02:19.319 --> 02:22.158
It was a deliberate
and brutal attack.

02:22.159 --> 02:25.279
She was hit by a blow
to the back of the head.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.599
She was knocked unconscious.
She was gagged.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.638
She had her hands tied
with blue fishing twine.

02:30.639 --> 02:32.919
- Miller's got a lead on that.
- Yeah, Humphries Nets in town.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.559
They're the main manufacturer
in the whole of the south-west.

02:35.560 --> 02:39.239
And then we think she was moved
to an area by the waterfall

02:39.280 --> 02:40.919
where she was raped.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.638
Traces of her blood were found
on stones next to the water.

02:43.639 --> 02:45.279
Her attacker gagged her -

02:45.280 --> 02:47.280
we need to find the
material used for the gag -

02:47.319 --> 02:50.559
and used a condom, all of
which suggests premeditation.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.638
We've asked the Atwoods,
who hired the house,

02:52.639 --> 02:55.359
to provide us with a full guest
list, and once we have it,

02:55.360 --> 02:56.919
DC Harford will coordinate

02:56.920 --> 02:58.438
interviewing everyone who was there.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.719
We also need to talk to the caterers,

03:00.720 --> 03:02.438
any entertainment suppliers,

03:02.439 --> 03:05.758
local businesses such as
minicabs who provided transport.

03:05.759 --> 03:07.758
There's also another road
in and out of the property,

03:07.759 --> 03:10.118
so it's possible the attacker
wasn't a guest at the party.

03:10.119 --> 03:13.038
Can we get more uniform
for searching the ground

03:13.039 --> 03:14.478
and divers for the lake?

03:14.479 --> 03:16.078
It's potentially a massive scene.

03:16.079 --> 03:18.078
No. For the moment,

03:18.079 --> 03:20.238
you lot here are the
extent of our resources.

03:20.239 --> 03:23.318
There's one CCTV camera
in the vicinity of the house,

03:23.319 --> 03:25.999
in the entrance hall,
but from the floor plans,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.359
there were another three
exits in use that night.

03:28.360 --> 03:31.799
No other cameras until
you get back onto the A35

03:31.800 --> 03:33.199
and the nearest traffic camera's

03:33.200 --> 03:34.838
a good nine miles from Axehampton.

03:34.839 --> 03:36.359
So even if the attacker drove,

03:36.360 --> 03:38.800
we won't necessarily
be able to track them.

03:41.319 --> 03:45.038
Uh, Trish has recently separated
from her husband, Ian.

03:45.039 --> 03:47.158
We'll talk to him today.
They have a daughter.

03:47.159 --> 03:49.158
- Leah.
- Yeah. She's 15.

03:49.159 --> 03:51.158
We'll need full Intel
on all known sex offenders

03:51.159 --> 03:53.279
living in the area,
details of their offences.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.599
Prioritise any that are recently
released or out on licence.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.638
SOCO are finishing up
at the crime scene today

03:57.639 --> 03:59.238
and we've got two uniform

03:59.239 --> 04:01.118
starting door-to-door
inquiries in the village.

04:01.119 --> 04:03.359
If you look at the map,
it's a hamlet, not a village.

04:03.360 --> 04:04.758
Thanks for that.

04:04.759 --> 04:07.518
What about the victim's
ABE interview? When's that?

04:07.519 --> 04:09.199
Can we not use the word 'victim'?

04:09.200 --> 04:11.078
Her name is Trish Winterman,
and her ABE interview

04:11.079 --> 04:13.158
will take place when we
judge she's up to it.

04:13.159 --> 04:15.439
We'll get a steer from her
ISVA later this morning.

04:16.319 --> 04:18.039
There's a time pressure here, right?

04:19.279 --> 04:22.360
She's still traumatised.
She may not have full recall.

04:23.479 --> 04:25.199
- Was she drunk?
- What?

04:25.200 --> 04:27.519
DC Harford. You want
to run this meeting?

04:29.800 --> 04:31.518
Sorry, sir.

04:31.519 --> 04:34.318
We can't keep this
from the public for too long,

04:34.319 --> 04:37.359
but there are people we wanna
talk to before the news gets out

04:37.360 --> 04:41.079
so for now, all of this
is kept to yourselves.

04:42.639 --> 04:45.479
Miller! Rope factory, come on.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.238
Are you the only manufacturers

04:48.239 --> 04:50.238
of rope and twine in the region?

04:50.239 --> 04:52.438
Nets and lines for fishing
used to be the main industry

04:52.439 --> 04:54.919
but we're the only one left
making them in Broadchurch now.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.758
All the others closed up.

04:56.759 --> 04:58.518
Fishing's dying on its arse.

04:58.519 --> 05:00.479
So, what sort of samples are you after?

05:00.519 --> 05:03.118
Uh, one of every product you make.

05:03.119 --> 05:05.438
Nets and lines? We do a lot.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.679
I'd like one of everything, please.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.399
And what do you want it for?

05:09.400 --> 05:12.399
You'll be assisting us
with an ongoing investigation.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.679
You gonna give me any more than that?

05:14.680 --> 05:16.239
No.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.000
Don't know if I'm comfortable with this.

05:20.039 --> 05:22.399
"Not comfortable"?
How old are you, son?

05:22.400 --> 05:25.158
- 23.
- You're in charge of this place?

05:25.159 --> 05:27.839
Said I was in charge today.

05:27.879 --> 05:30.438
- Ah.
- And most days, really.

05:30.439 --> 05:32.799
I've totally got authority
to take decisions.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.199
But the business belongs to my family.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.238
My dad's the legal owner,
but he's more interested

05:38.239 --> 05:40.238
in playing golf,
so he lets me run things.

05:40.239 --> 05:42.559
It's not exactly difficult.

05:42.560 --> 05:45.878
Well, if you've totally got
the authority to make decisions,

05:45.879 --> 05:48.599
totally make the decision
to cooperate with our requests

05:48.600 --> 05:51.599
or we'll totally
come back with a warrant.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.639
And I might phone your dad.

06:03.439 --> 06:05.999
You'll need to read
and sign this short statement.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.878
What's it say?

06:08.879 --> 06:10.919
Just who you are, where you work,

06:10.920 --> 06:13.078
what rope you make, who you supply

06:13.079 --> 06:14.958
and what you're giving us -
basic factual stuff.

06:14.959 --> 06:16.680
Just sign here.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.199
How many people work here?

06:28.200 --> 06:30.238
Uh, 11, I think, in total.

06:30.239 --> 06:32.238
All on staff contracts?

06:32.239 --> 06:35.359
We take on some casuals
when we have a big order.

06:35.360 --> 06:38.238
I'll need a list of all your
staff for the last three years.

06:38.239 --> 06:41.079
- I'll try, but...
- Great. Thanks.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.199
Is there anything else
you're gonna demand?

06:45.200 --> 06:49.159
Where were you on
Saturday night, Leo?

06:50.079 --> 06:51.919
I was out with my girlfriend.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.359
Had a few drinks at the Anglers

06:53.360 --> 06:55.078
and then a kebab on the way home.

06:55.079 --> 06:58.600
Ah, romantic. And she'll
confirm this story, will she?

06:59.839 --> 07:01.560
Yeah, course.

07:04.439 --> 07:06.439
Suppose you want her details and all.

07:06.479 --> 07:07.999
Please!

07:08.000 --> 07:09.399
He was very keen on himself.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.238
Yeah, weren't he just.

07:11.239 --> 07:14.238
But they do produce some
very nice blue fishing twine.

07:14.239 --> 07:17.518
Test that against the fibres
from Trish's wrist wounds.

07:17.519 --> 07:20.279
But even if it's a match,
what does that prove?

07:20.280 --> 07:22.158
It doesn't prove anything,

07:22.159 --> 07:24.238
but it just increases the probability

07:24.239 --> 07:25.799
that her attacker lives locally.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.199
Just because it was made there

07:27.200 --> 07:28.799
doesn't mean it was bought round here.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.279
Think that that boy's affected

07:30.280 --> 07:31.999
your naturally optimistic
disposition, Miller.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.318
I am never in the mood
for swaggery young shits.

07:34.319 --> 07:37.159
Let's get to Jim
Atwood's, get the invite list.

07:38.159 --> 07:40.199
This is the list.

07:40.200 --> 07:43.078
It's got all Cath's
added scribbles on it.

07:43.079 --> 07:44.958
She kept bloody meeting
people and inviting them.

07:44.959 --> 07:46.958
I told her she had to
stop at some point,

07:46.959 --> 07:48.799
but then, that's my wife for you -

07:48.800 --> 07:50.199
never one to hear the word no.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.519
Oh, that's great. Thanks.

07:53.159 --> 07:54.838
Have you seen Trish?

07:54.839 --> 07:57.478
At the moment, we're not able
to discuss anything other than

07:57.479 --> 07:59.038
the fact that we're investigating

07:59.039 --> 08:00.559
a serious sexual assault.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.399
Does Ian know yet?

08:02.400 --> 08:05.359
I'd ask you not to discuss
this with anyone else

08:05.360 --> 08:08.078
until we've formally
made the news public.

08:08.079 --> 08:09.719
People are already talking.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.559
Make sure you're not one of them.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.919
Why did you have a fight
with Ed Burnett at the party?

08:13.920 --> 08:16.599
Oh, you heard
about that, did you?

08:16.600 --> 08:18.679
- Your wife mentioned it.
- Ah, did she?

08:18.680 --> 08:20.318
What was that all about?

08:20.319 --> 08:23.318
Just the same stuff
we always argue about.

08:23.319 --> 08:26.118
The way he runs the shop,
my wife's shift patterns,

08:26.119 --> 08:27.600
the refugee crisis.

08:28.639 --> 08:30.719
Yeah, mostly shift patterns.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.720
He's, um... a knob.

08:36.078 --> 08:38.318
And how long have you
and Cath been married?

08:43.559 --> 08:45.199
Uh... Phew!

08:45.200 --> 08:46.638
27 years in August.

08:46.639 --> 08:48.680
Hoping for time off for good behaviour.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.638
- Do you fish?
- No.

08:54.639 --> 08:56.600
No, I tried to. A few times.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.238
Oh, I keep all that there

09:00.239 --> 09:02.158
'cause Cath said she didn't
want it cluttering up the house.

09:02.159 --> 09:03.959
I couldn't bear to get rid of it.

09:07.079 --> 09:10.118
Can you make a time
to come down to the station

09:10.119 --> 09:12.680
for a full statement about your
movements on Saturday night?

09:14.039 --> 09:17.038
Is there any particular reason
that I need to do that?

09:17.039 --> 09:18.679
We need all the details we can get.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.159
It was your party, after all.

09:22.439 --> 09:25.078
And we'll need you to
give a sample of DNA.

09:25.079 --> 09:27.280
We'll be asking everyone
at the party to do the same.

09:27.319 --> 09:29.078
It's completely voluntary.

09:29.079 --> 09:31.599
No problem.

09:31.600 --> 09:36.559
I was thinking, um,
when I was making the list up.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.519
We knew everybody there.

09:39.720 --> 09:44.158
So that means... one of our
friends could have done this.

09:44.159 --> 09:47.038
We need the list to
rule people out as much as in.

09:47.039 --> 09:48.438
Well, that's good to know.

09:48.439 --> 09:50.158
Unless you've any specific concerns

09:50.159 --> 09:51.720
about anyone who was there that night?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.720
You let me have a think about that.

10:01.479 --> 10:04.318
Not exactly a vote of confidence
in his party guests, was it?

10:04.319 --> 10:06.238
Any names you recognise in there?

10:06.239 --> 10:08.559
Yeah, quite a few,
and they'll all be starting

10:08.560 --> 10:10.759
to talk amongst themselves
and speculating.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.439
Here you go. Alright?

10:34.720 --> 10:36.680
Maggie. Sorry to keep you waiting.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.920
Three weeks I've had to wait
to get an appointment with you.

10:40.959 --> 10:43.318
I know. I'm so sorry.

10:43.319 --> 10:45.279
But I'm glad you're here now.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.159
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?

10:47.200 --> 10:48.799
I cannot work for a company

10:48.800 --> 10:52.078
that no longer allows me
to choose my own front page.

10:52.079 --> 10:53.999
I've been doing this
for nearly 30 years

10:54.000 --> 10:55.638
and I'm bloody good at it,

10:55.639 --> 10:58.638
unlike whoever threw out
my front page this week

10:58.639 --> 11:01.399
and substituted this.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.878
Kittens in a bin.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.679
It's kittens escaping from a bin.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.919
- On the front page.
- It's feelgood and it sells.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.719
It's page 5 filler.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.518
The lead should be
the planning permission given

11:13.519 --> 11:14.999
for 300 new homes.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.719
Which moron thought that was better?

11:16.720 --> 11:18.559
I did. I changed it.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.878
I hope you're ashamed of yourself.

11:20.879 --> 11:22.758
No, I'm not.

11:22.759 --> 11:25.599
You lead on planning or parking
or petty crime every week.

11:25.600 --> 11:29.199
We're a paper of record
for the life of the town.

11:29.200 --> 11:32.158
That stuff just makes
my paper look frivolous

11:32.159 --> 11:34.680
and undermines my position as editor.

11:35.680 --> 11:38.318
But then, that's been
a long time coming.

11:38.319 --> 11:41.838
I've lost my only journalist
to a national tabloid,

11:41.839 --> 11:43.318
and now I'm expected to cover

11:43.319 --> 11:45.078
every story that happens around here

11:45.079 --> 11:47.720
on my own, in a tiny room
and with no support.

11:47.759 --> 11:50.359
I know it's been hard,

11:50.360 --> 11:52.958
but you're not gonna be
stuck there alone anymore.

11:52.959 --> 11:55.238
Oh, well, good.

11:55.239 --> 11:57.839
You're coming to work here.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.038
I don't think so, petal.

12:01.039 --> 12:02.919
The lease on your building's up.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.318
We're not renewing.

12:04.319 --> 12:06.919
There's hot-desking
capacity for you here.

12:06.920 --> 12:08.518
Not a chance - I need to be

12:08.519 --> 12:10.238
where the stories are,
where the people are.

12:10.239 --> 12:12.078
I can't do that from here.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.999
You know how tough
print economics are, Maggie.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.599
We can't sustain a
presence in Broadchurch.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.920
We're closing the offices.

12:19.959 --> 12:22.518
The paper will continue,
but it'll offer content

12:22.519 --> 12:24.958
from a wider area
using pooled resources.

12:24.959 --> 12:27.478
That's not local news.

12:27.479 --> 12:29.638
People need their
own lives reflected.

12:29.639 --> 12:31.199
That's the whole point.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.518
We're redefining what
we mean by 'local'.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.239
Oh, for God's sake!

12:36.839 --> 12:38.438
When's all this supposed to happen?

12:38.439 --> 12:41.078
The lease runs out four weeks on Friday.

12:41.079 --> 12:44.078
The 'Broadchurch Echo'
has served that town

12:44.079 --> 12:46.518
for more than a century.

12:46.519 --> 12:48.238
It matters to people.

12:48.239 --> 12:51.119
Then they should be buying
it in greater numbers.

12:54.959 --> 12:57.279
Times change, Maggie.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.839
Don't get left behind.

13:02.039 --> 13:03.758
I don't want a steer from Beth.

13:03.759 --> 13:05.919
I want her to help us get
Trish Winterman's interview

13:05.920 --> 13:07.318
done as a matter of urgency.

13:07.319 --> 13:08.878
You know the state Trish is in.

13:08.879 --> 13:10.559
If we leave it
one or two more days...

13:10.560 --> 13:12.438
It can't be done.
There's too much at risk.

13:12.439 --> 13:15.039
That ABE interview is Trish's
main video evidence in court

13:15.079 --> 13:16.719
if the case gets that far.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.719
And if she makes a mistake
or her memory's hazy,

13:18.720 --> 13:21.559
- it causes massive problems...
- So we wait, we delay getting

13:21.560 --> 13:23.559
a crucial piece of information
and another woman gets attacked?

13:23.560 --> 13:25.638
That's not Trish's responsibility.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.518
No, it's mine!

13:27.519 --> 13:30.118
I've got to weigh up
the rest of Trish's evidence

13:30.119 --> 13:32.078
against the safety of
other members of the public.

13:32.079 --> 13:35.799
- Can't we protect them both?
- Tell me how.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.799
We've gotta get to what
she knows as soon as we can.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.639
Brief Beth. She's gotta
get Trish in a fit state.

13:45.759 --> 13:48.518
Tom's been excluded
from school for a week.

13:48.519 --> 13:50.559
- What for?
- Sharing porn on his phone.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.958
- No!
- Yeah.

13:51.959 --> 13:53.518
So that's good.

13:53.519 --> 13:54.919
Cor, bloody hell, Beth.

13:54.920 --> 13:58.199
These bloody devices,
you don't know what's on them.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.920
The access they have to this
stuff. We never had any of that.

14:00.959 --> 14:03.438
The best I had was Alice Wilson

14:03.439 --> 14:06.319
reading the dirty bits of Jilly
Cooper out loud when we were 13.

14:07.839 --> 14:11.280
Still get a bit of a tingle
when I think about it now!

14:12.239 --> 14:14.359
I found my mum's
vibrator when I was 12.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.359
- No, you didn't!
- I asked her what it was for.

14:16.360 --> 14:18.478
- What did she say?
- She said it was a whisk.

14:18.479 --> 14:21.679
And "Don't tell Dad," which I
thought was weird for a whisk.

14:21.680 --> 14:25.800
Oh, God, her face.
I can't bear to think about it.

14:31.439 --> 14:34.079
Beth, we need your help
with Trish Winterman.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.919
I haven't even met her yet!

14:36.920 --> 14:40.038
I know, but we need to move
the investigation forward fast

14:40.039 --> 14:41.799
and she's our main source of evidence.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.999
If she could do her interview
as soon as possible,

14:44.000 --> 14:45.438
it'd make a massive difference.

14:45.439 --> 14:47.318
That's not my job, Ellie.
You shouldn't be asking.

14:47.319 --> 14:50.038
First meetings with clients
are hard enough as it is.

14:50.039 --> 14:51.838
I don't need pressure from you.

14:51.839 --> 14:53.639
We're supposed to be independent.

14:53.680 --> 14:57.038
Yeah, I know, but whoever attacked Trish

14:57.039 --> 14:59.359
is walking about unchallenged,
somewhere out here.

14:59.360 --> 15:03.159
And she's... she's our
main clue to finding him.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.239
I'm promising nothing.

15:09.439 --> 15:11.638
I've said, haven't I,
how amazing you are

15:11.639 --> 15:13.078
for choosing to do this job?

15:13.079 --> 15:14.958
Now you're just trying
to butter me up.

15:14.959 --> 15:16.799
No, I've done that.
I'm being honest now.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.000
I'm so proud of you, Beth.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.719
Trish?

15:49.720 --> 15:51.478
- I'm Beth.
- Hi.

15:51.479 --> 15:53.200
Nice to meet you.

15:57.159 --> 15:59.438
You're probably a bit nervous
about this, so shall I start

15:59.439 --> 16:01.399
by telling you
a bit about what we do?

16:01.400 --> 16:02.719
Mmm.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.878
I'm from Wessex Rape Response.

16:04.879 --> 16:06.318
We're an independent organisation.

16:06.319 --> 16:08.158
We're not part of the police.

16:08.159 --> 16:11.118
We support people who've
experienced sexual violence.

16:11.119 --> 16:13.118
There's three strands to what we do.

16:13.119 --> 16:15.878
We run a help line,
counselling sessions,

16:15.879 --> 16:17.559
and then there's ISVAs -

16:17.560 --> 16:19.559
Independent Sexual
Violence Advisors -

16:19.560 --> 16:21.238
which is me.

16:21.239 --> 16:24.399
I'm not a counsellor,
but I can arrange counselling.

16:24.400 --> 16:28.078
My role is to support you
through the police investigation

16:28.079 --> 16:30.958
and if it goes to trial,
I'll be there all the way.

16:30.959 --> 16:34.239
What I do is completely client-led.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.800
I don't have any agenda
except to help you, OK?

16:38.479 --> 16:40.318
How are you doing so far?

16:40.319 --> 16:42.518
Are you up to a bit of paperwork?

16:42.519 --> 16:44.639
- Yeah, OK.
- Great.

16:48.200 --> 16:51.279
This says that
I can share information

16:51.280 --> 16:53.438
with other agencies if appropriate.

16:53.439 --> 16:56.118
Basically, if you tell me anything

16:56.119 --> 16:58.838
that gives me cause for concern
for you or other people,

16:58.839 --> 17:01.600
I have a duty of care to pass
that on - do you understand?

17:03.039 --> 17:06.877
So I just need you to sign there
where it says 'victim's name'.

17:06.878 --> 17:09.117
Sorry about that.

17:09.118 --> 17:10.679
I don't know why
they have that there.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.759
We don't use that word.
We use the word 'client'.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.519
Thanks.

17:18.720 --> 17:22.200
Some information leaflets
for you to take with you.

17:24.759 --> 17:26.999
We're gonna have regular meetings,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.799
so have a think about
how often you'd like.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.599
We could meet somewhere like this

17:31.600 --> 17:33.518
or I could come to your house.

17:33.519 --> 17:36.359
If there's developments
in the investigation

17:36.360 --> 17:38.199
or if you have questions
for the police,

17:38.200 --> 17:39.680
I can help you with those.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.758
Am I right in thinking
you haven't given

17:43.759 --> 17:45.359
- your full interview yet?
- Mmm.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.360
How are you feeling about doing it?

17:48.720 --> 17:50.478
I do wanna talk to them.

17:50.479 --> 17:53.280
I... I just don't know if I'm ready.

17:59.759 --> 18:01.158
You do what's right for you.

18:01.159 --> 18:03.000
Don't worry about what anyone else says.

18:05.159 --> 18:06.999
Once you're ready, I could come with you

18:07.000 --> 18:08.600
to the interview, if that's helpful.

18:08.639 --> 18:10.038
Would you do that?

18:10.039 --> 18:12.680
Of course. I'm here for
whatever you need.

18:14.519 --> 18:17.878
I feel... like I'm not
in my own body.

18:17.879 --> 18:20.318
I can understand that.

18:20.319 --> 18:24.239
Your mind and your body are not
gonna be behaving normally.

18:25.319 --> 18:28.158
You might be going through
a process of trauma.

18:28.159 --> 18:30.279
There's information in these leaflets

18:30.280 --> 18:32.759
about rape trauma syndrome
which might be useful.

18:35.400 --> 18:39.958
Whatever you're feeling,
whether it be sad, angry,

18:39.959 --> 18:42.958
disturbed, exhausted, depressed,

18:42.959 --> 18:44.560
it's all normal, OK?

18:47.519 --> 18:49.360
Thank you.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.199
You might not think it,
but you're doing amazingly.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.319
- I'm not!
- You are.

18:57.879 --> 19:00.438
You got up, you got dressed,

19:00.439 --> 19:02.038
you did your hair, did your make-up,

19:02.039 --> 19:03.758
you came here and you talked to me.

19:03.759 --> 19:05.959
These are massive victories.

19:06.839 --> 19:09.638
These crimes, they make you feel like

19:09.639 --> 19:11.719
your control has been taken away,

19:11.720 --> 19:13.999
like there's no light
at the end of the tunnel.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.638
But there is.

19:15.639 --> 19:19.000
And we're gonna find
that light together, OK?

19:21.319 --> 19:22.919
I feel...

19:22.920 --> 19:24.680
so ashamed.

19:26.759 --> 19:28.759
I wish he'd just killed me.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.799
<i>- Beth?</i>
- Hey.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.638
I don't think she'll be ready today.

19:42.639 --> 19:45.600
<i>Can you hold her there? We'll
come by now, have a quick word.</i>

19:51.400 --> 19:53.799
You know, I don't know
if we should be pushing

19:53.800 --> 19:55.318
if Beth says she's not ready.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.518
Well, Beth Latimer
is not in charge here.

19:57.519 --> 19:59.200
You alright?

20:01.159 --> 20:03.199
Murder I can make sense of.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.519
Sexual offences...

20:10.360 --> 20:12.838
Trish, we're gonna
release a statement

20:12.839 --> 20:14.399
later today about the attack.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.478
It'll be very brief and non-specific.

20:16.479 --> 20:19.078
It won't mention your name
or the exact location.

20:19.079 --> 20:22.238
We just wanted you to know
in case you saw it anywhere.

20:22.239 --> 20:23.999
Right. You have
to do that, do you?

20:24.000 --> 20:27.038
Well, it's important for us
to release limited information

20:27.039 --> 20:28.758
into the public domain

20:28.759 --> 20:31.199
in case it encourages
any witnesses to come forward.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.279
We'd also like you to
come in at 4pm today

20:33.280 --> 20:35.680
for your ABE interview.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.758
Right. If that's what you want.

20:41.759 --> 20:44.400
You're welcome to have Beth
accompany you if it helps.

20:54.479 --> 20:56.438
We were still discussing the timing.

20:56.439 --> 20:58.438
No! You were discussing it.
I'd made a decision.

20:58.439 --> 21:00.038
- Can we not just...
- No, we can't!

21:00.039 --> 21:01.758
Because what if another woman gets raped

21:01.759 --> 21:04.078
while we're still discussing -
how'd you feel living with that

21:04.079 --> 21:05.958
the rest of your career,
the rest of your life?

21:05.959 --> 21:08.118
- Look, I know it's hard, but...
- No, you don't, actually.

21:08.119 --> 21:09.478
'Cause it's easy being you, Miller.

21:09.479 --> 21:11.518
- Oh.
- I'm the one who's responsible.

21:11.519 --> 21:14.119
I'm the one who has to decide
and that's what I've done.

21:14.159 --> 21:16.560
So I don't want to hear
any more about it.

21:17.839 --> 21:19.639
We just focus on the ex-husband.

21:22.159 --> 21:24.438
We're investigating
a serious sexual assault

21:24.439 --> 21:28.038
that took place at Axehampton
House on Saturday night.

21:28.039 --> 21:31.638
Bloody hell!
What, at Cath Atwood's party?

21:31.639 --> 21:33.719
You were there, we understand.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.799
Yeah, good friends of Cath and Jim.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.238
We used to, me and my wife...

21:37.239 --> 21:38.799
I'm separated from my wife, Trish,

21:38.800 --> 21:40.199
but when we were together,

21:40.200 --> 21:42.199
the four of us saw a lot of each other.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.118
And did you go to the party by yourself?

21:44.119 --> 21:46.318
No, I was with my girlfriend, Sarah.

21:46.319 --> 21:47.958
She teaches geography here.

21:47.959 --> 21:50.118
And were you together all night?

21:50.119 --> 21:52.559
Not all the time, no.

21:52.560 --> 21:55.158
But you left together.

21:55.159 --> 21:58.200
No, she left before me.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.200
Any reason for that?

22:01.239 --> 22:05.038
Sarah feels that she isn't
always made welcome,

22:05.039 --> 22:06.838
particularly by Cath.

22:06.839 --> 22:09.838
So she left first.
She got a taxi, I think.

22:09.839 --> 22:13.359
In fact, I know she did,
because she had the same driver

22:13.360 --> 22:15.878
who'd brought Trish to the
party earlier in the evening.

22:15.879 --> 22:19.679
She said she couldn't escape
me even on the way home.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.680
And did you have much to drink?

22:22.759 --> 22:24.319
A bit.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.758
Quite a lot. Enough
to leave the car there.

22:27.759 --> 22:30.038
Oh, so how did you get home?

22:30.039 --> 22:33.878
I, uh, shared a taxi
with a couple of other people.

22:33.879 --> 22:36.078
Could you give us their names?

22:36.079 --> 22:37.679
I don't think I could, no, sorry.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.878
They were, like, a cousin
or an aunty of Cath's, I think.

22:40.879 --> 22:42.719
What cab company was it?

22:42.720 --> 22:45.478
I... I don't know. I just
remember the light on top.

22:45.479 --> 22:49.279
As I say, I was... a bit the
worse for wear by that point.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.158
Who got dropped off first, you or them?

22:51.159 --> 22:54.119
Uh, me, I think.

22:55.319 --> 22:57.919
Cath Atwood would know who they were?

22:57.920 --> 23:00.560
Presumably, yes.

23:06.280 --> 23:09.478
And you said your wife
was at the party.

23:09.479 --> 23:11.318
Yes. Why?

23:11.319 --> 23:13.158
Did you talk to her?

23:13.159 --> 23:16.438
We exchanged pleasantries
shortly after she got there

23:16.439 --> 23:18.958
and then later on
we exchanged unpleasantries.

23:18.959 --> 23:20.759
What do you mean by that?

23:23.680 --> 23:27.438
It's not very nice seeing the
woman you used to be married to

23:27.439 --> 23:30.878
drunk and cavorting with
a lot of strange men.

23:30.879 --> 23:32.559
I mean, by all accounts

23:32.560 --> 23:35.038
she's slept with half a dozen
blokes in the last few months

23:35.039 --> 23:37.238
and God knows how many of
them were at the party.

23:37.239 --> 23:40.200
It's embarrassing. Technically,
we are still married.

23:44.639 --> 23:47.439
So we had words outside.

23:47.479 --> 23:51.118
She'd gone out for a cigarette -
another bone of contention.

23:51.119 --> 23:53.479
So you had an argument?

23:54.600 --> 23:56.318
I think we probably did, yes.

23:56.319 --> 23:58.599
My memory gets a little
bit hazy at that point

23:58.600 --> 24:00.599
and I'm sure Trish would say the same.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.279
It was a boozy night all round.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.438
So, how did the argument end?

24:05.439 --> 24:07.359
I went back inside.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.559
And you didn't see her
the rest of the night?

24:09.560 --> 24:10.958
No.

24:10.959 --> 24:12.359
So people would attest that

24:12.360 --> 24:15.000
you were in the main
house until later on?

24:15.039 --> 24:18.199
Why would anyone need to
attest to where I was?

24:18.200 --> 24:20.479
We're just compiling a record
of people's movements.

24:21.680 --> 24:25.118
Look, don't you think
you should be telling me

24:25.119 --> 24:26.679
a little bit - I mean, anything -

24:26.680 --> 24:27.680
about what's happened?

24:27.720 --> 24:30.038
No, we can't, I'm afraid.

24:30.039 --> 24:32.719
But we would like to ask you
for a quick DNA sample.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.560
Right, um...

24:37.039 --> 24:39.478
I don't mean to be awkward, but...

24:39.479 --> 24:42.438
I don't really like the idea of...

24:42.439 --> 24:44.759
Do I have to? Am I legally obliged?

24:46.519 --> 24:48.758
It's voluntary.

24:48.759 --> 24:52.559
Well, in that case, I'll decline
for now, if that's alright.

24:52.560 --> 24:55.518
I don't like the idea
of my DNA being on file

24:55.519 --> 24:58.679
until I know why
and how it's being stored.

24:58.680 --> 25:02.600
I'm not a big fan of
police hoarding biodata.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.720
Is that right?

25:12.319 --> 25:14.599
Well, at least we know
how Trish got to the party.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.118
We need to track down
that taxi driver that took her.

25:17.119 --> 25:19.199
Our first DNA refusal.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.600
Mmm. Interesting decision.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.238
- Daisy.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

25:36.239 --> 25:38.318
I'm at work. Is everything alright?

25:38.319 --> 25:40.758
<i>We gonna meet for lunch?</i>

25:40.759 --> 25:44.199
Yeah, that's right, we were.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.199
You're not coming, are you?

25:46.200 --> 25:48.199
Oh, I don't think
I'm gonna make it on time.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.838
No, Daise. I'm sorry.

25:49.839 --> 25:51.838
- It's fine.
<i>- I'm really sorry.</i>

25:51.839 --> 25:53.519
<i>- It's this new case.</i>
- Yep.

25:56.039 --> 25:57.638
I'll see you later then.

25:57.639 --> 25:59.438
Tonight. We'll go tonight, yeah?

25:59.439 --> 26:01.959
- Yep, OK. 'Bye.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

26:05.720 --> 26:08.559
- Everything alright?
- No, I messed up.

26:08.560 --> 26:11.118
How do you do it, Miller -
the whole single parent thing?

26:11.119 --> 26:14.878
By constantly absorbing feelings
of failure, guilt and shame.

26:14.879 --> 26:17.680
Look, he's our guy.
First one in the queue.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.359
Your radio controller told
us that you took a fare

26:21.360 --> 26:23.799
to the party in Axehampton
on Saturday night.

26:23.800 --> 26:26.038
I took a lot of people back and forth.

26:26.039 --> 26:27.719
It was a big do.

26:27.720 --> 26:31.238
Yeah, and you picked up a fare
from, uh, West Flintcombe.

26:31.239 --> 26:32.958
Trish Winterman. She's a regular.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.518
Do you know her well?

26:34.519 --> 26:37.758
No. Only through work.

26:37.759 --> 26:39.958
Just her in the back of the cab?

26:39.959 --> 26:41.359
Yeah.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.719
And you got to the gardens when?

26:43.720 --> 26:46.199
20 past, half past eight.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.559
She had me booked for the return
journey later that night,

26:48.560 --> 26:49.958
but she never turned up.

26:49.959 --> 26:52.799
I waited for a while, tried her mobile,

26:52.800 --> 26:55.159
then I took a couple of
others back to town instead.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.599
Do you remember their names?

26:57.600 --> 26:59.799
No. Didn't ask.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.958
I dropped them a couple
of streets from the church.

27:01.959 --> 27:04.518
And you were working all night?

27:04.519 --> 27:05.958
Till 3:00.

27:05.959 --> 27:07.439
Graveyard shift.

27:08.680 --> 27:11.118
So we were talking to your
radio controller, and she said

27:11.119 --> 27:13.599
you developed a fault with your
radio halfway through the night

27:13.600 --> 27:15.079
and she couldn't contact you.

27:15.959 --> 27:17.838
That's right.

27:17.839 --> 27:20.158
We've been moaning at them
to get us new gear for a while.

27:20.159 --> 27:22.119
They say it's too expensive.

27:22.159 --> 27:24.360
How did you work all
night without a radio?

27:25.959 --> 27:28.438
I figured if I stayed
in the car park at the party

27:28.439 --> 27:31.438
with my light on, I'd stand
a chance of some fares.

27:31.439 --> 27:33.439
You were in the car park all night?

27:34.720 --> 27:37.158
No. I ferried people back and forth.

27:37.159 --> 27:39.958
Why did you not come back here,
tell them about the radio?

27:39.959 --> 27:41.599
Didn't think.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.680
And I knew I'd get fares at Axehampton.

27:45.039 --> 27:47.359
Sorry - what's this about?

27:47.360 --> 27:49.279
There was a serious sexual assault

27:49.280 --> 27:51.038
at the party on Saturday.

27:51.039 --> 27:53.720
What, so you come for the cab driver?

27:57.360 --> 28:00.158
Would you mind giving us a DNA sample?

28:00.159 --> 28:03.719
<i>Car 2,
Quarry Road, Poole. 3860.</i>

28:03.720 --> 28:05.479
That's a fare for me.

28:06.879 --> 28:10.279
- Can we do this another time?
- Sure.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.279
Clear as a bell now, that radio.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.360
Yep.

28:32.360 --> 28:33.919
- Coffee.
- Ta.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.159
From the shack you like.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.999
I'm sorry about last night.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.519
Yeah, me too.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.279
How's your, uh, new client?

28:45.280 --> 28:48.799
Not good. I've been
with her this morning.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.878
They got any idea who did it?

28:50.879 --> 28:52.759
- They don't tell me that.
- No.

28:53.879 --> 28:55.719
How are you coping?

28:55.720 --> 28:57.518
Yeah, you know.

28:57.519 --> 29:00.038
That's what they don't
tell you about this job.

29:00.039 --> 29:02.078
Like, who supports
the support workers?

29:02.079 --> 29:04.159
That's why I called you.

29:05.560 --> 29:07.639
Right.

29:10.039 --> 29:12.199
Beth, you're not being fair.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.919
You know, you... you can't
just call me up and ask me

29:14.920 --> 29:17.638
to come meet you for coffee like
everything's still the same.

29:17.639 --> 29:20.400
- Can't I?
- No.

29:21.600 --> 29:24.279
You know you can treat me
like your little dog -

29:24.280 --> 29:26.799
give me a whistle
and I'll come running -

29:26.800 --> 29:28.799
but I need you not to do that.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.119
I need you not to give me any hope.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.719
I'm sorry that's how you feel.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.759
Well...

29:38.920 --> 29:40.720
Want me to be honest, don't you?

29:48.839 --> 29:51.038
This came this morning.

29:51.039 --> 29:53.560
Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.199
It's the cheque.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.679
With a written apology for
the administrative errors

29:58.680 --> 30:00.400
that made it take so long.

30:01.959 --> 30:04.399
5,500 for Chloe,

30:04.400 --> 30:06.919
5,500 for us, which
I suppose we should split.

30:06.920 --> 30:09.399
- Don't want it.
- You might as well take it.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.039
Don't want it.

30:12.039 --> 30:14.200
I don't want compensation.
I want justice.

30:15.119 --> 30:17.478
11 grand for our little boy's life?

30:17.479 --> 30:20.199
What, a grand a year?
Is that what he's worth?

30:20.200 --> 30:21.838
It's the standard sum
for a murdered relative.

30:21.839 --> 30:23.438
Do you want us to turn it down?

30:23.439 --> 30:25.079
That won't put Joe Miller in prison.

30:26.039 --> 30:28.039
I'm still fighting, Beth.

30:28.079 --> 30:30.319
I know. That's the problem.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.680
Maggie?

30:40.959 --> 30:42.720
Everything alright?

30:42.759 --> 30:44.639
I'm feeling murderous.

30:45.920 --> 30:48.560
Thought this place might
restore my equanimity.

30:50.439 --> 30:51.800
Is it working?

30:52.879 --> 30:54.519
Not in the slightest.

30:55.680 --> 30:58.438
Normally I'd be at home,
bending Jocelyn's ear,

30:58.439 --> 31:00.878
but she's away in London for ages.

31:00.879 --> 31:02.400
Big trial.

31:07.079 --> 31:09.719
They want to close the paper.

31:09.720 --> 31:11.958
They can't do that.

31:11.959 --> 31:14.680
The writing's been on
the wall for a while now.

31:18.360 --> 31:21.838
I feel so powerless. It's the
only thing I know how to do.

31:21.839 --> 31:24.039
I've given my life to it.

31:26.039 --> 31:27.719
What can we do?

31:27.720 --> 31:29.238
Letters, petitions?

31:29.239 --> 31:30.759
March on the offices?

31:32.000 --> 31:33.679
Bless you, petal,

31:33.680 --> 31:36.878
but I've looked in the eyes
of the corporate behemoth...

31:36.879 --> 31:40.159
Think it'd be a waste of breath.

31:41.639 --> 31:44.238
Just be glad you've got a job for life.

31:44.239 --> 31:46.559
People will always need a bit of God.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.600
I wish you were right.

31:51.119 --> 31:53.158
On Sundays now, the church is emptier

31:53.159 --> 31:54.759
than before Danny was killed.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.560
You don't come.

31:59.360 --> 32:02.200
Beth and Mark don't come,
Ellie and half the people

32:02.239 --> 32:04.159
that were affected by
what happened here.

32:05.319 --> 32:09.118
People look to God when they
want something and then...

32:09.119 --> 32:12.158
Well, now they've just deserted him.

32:12.159 --> 32:15.318
No, Paul! No, people love you.

32:15.319 --> 32:18.999
You've pulled so many of us
through these past few years.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.838
Exactly - I'm the priest

32:20.839 --> 32:22.478
the people look to
when they're hurting

32:22.479 --> 32:24.519
and then desert when everything's OK.

32:25.959 --> 32:28.519
I've got more to offer than that.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.838
Sorry to come back to you so quick.

32:34.839 --> 32:37.679
What time did you say Lucas was
off radio from on Saturday?

32:37.680 --> 32:39.438
About 10:30 onwards.

32:39.439 --> 32:41.239
But he already had bookings in place?

32:41.280 --> 32:43.638
Yeah, he did. It was a bloody nightmare.

32:43.639 --> 32:46.158
I gave him a proper
bollocking the day after.

32:46.159 --> 32:49.438
I told him he pulls a stunt
like that again, he's out.

32:49.439 --> 32:52.518
Bloody law unto himself.
He thinks he's better than us.

32:52.519 --> 32:54.799
Do you have a list of...

32:54.800 --> 32:57.758
Budmouth Taxis, how can I help you?

32:57.759 --> 32:59.158
Could you hold on a minute?

32:59.159 --> 33:00.799
Do you have a list of his bookings -

33:00.800 --> 33:02.318
the ones he did and didn't carry out?

33:02.319 --> 33:04.878
Somewhere back here.

33:04.879 --> 33:06.599
Let me see if I can find it.

33:06.600 --> 33:09.239
That would be most helpful.
Thank you!

33:16.839 --> 33:18.679
- Hi!
- Hi yourself!

33:18.680 --> 33:20.359
Alright? Good time?

33:20.360 --> 33:23.399
It was alright! Did you see
my photos on Instagram?

33:23.400 --> 33:25.919
Oh, uh, no.

33:25.920 --> 33:27.400
I thought you follow me.

33:30.360 --> 33:31.999
Hi! Who's this?

33:32.000 --> 33:35.359
Uh, this is, um, Beth.
She's a friend.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.279
Hi.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.239
What have you done to your head?

33:41.800 --> 33:44.319
Mum... Mum...

33:46.000 --> 33:48.438
- Trish, I can go.
- No, no. I need you here.

33:48.439 --> 33:50.999
- Mum, what's happened?
- Um...

33:51.000 --> 33:53.279
While you were away,

33:53.280 --> 33:55.359
at Cath's party on Saturday,

33:55.360 --> 33:57.999
this... this man attacked me.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.118
- What?!
- Just let me finish, love.

34:00.119 --> 34:03.039
He... he knocked me out...

34:05.479 --> 34:07.479
and he raped me.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.878
I was raped, Leah.

34:10.879 --> 34:13.199
I've been raped.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.438
Oh, the news statement was approved.

34:26.438 --> 34:28.518
Just waiting for the word
from you to release.

34:29.679 --> 34:32.119
OK. Send it out.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.560
This is Trish?

34:43.159 --> 34:45.800
Yeah, I think so.

34:50.600 --> 34:53.478
<i>Wessex Police say
a 49-year-old woman</i>

34:53.478 --> 34:56.158
<i>was the victim of
a serious sexual assault</i>

34:56.159 --> 34:58.719
<i>in the Axehampton area
on Saturday night.</i>

34:58.720 --> 35:01.679
<i>They're asking for anyone
with any information</i>

35:01.680 --> 35:05.519
<i>to contact them in confidence
as a matter of urgency.</i>

35:16.800 --> 35:19.239
- Here you go, mate.
- Ta.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.638
Got the compensation
cheque through today.

35:22.639 --> 35:24.919
For having a murdered son.

35:24.920 --> 35:27.758
11 grand, it was, for the family.

35:27.759 --> 35:31.238
Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That
must dredge it all up again.

35:31.239 --> 35:33.439
It never went away.

35:35.280 --> 35:38.319
- You've done so well.
- I'm glad it looks that way.

35:40.119 --> 35:42.238
Yeah, I reckon I tried everything, mate.

35:42.239 --> 35:45.319
Yoga, boxing, meditating.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.759
And as for all that
bloody counselling...

35:48.800 --> 35:50.999
God knows how long I spent

35:51.000 --> 35:53.958
talking about it, writing diaries,

35:53.959 --> 35:56.958
drawing bloody pictures
of my emotional state.

35:56.959 --> 35:59.600
None of it's even touched the sides.

36:00.720 --> 36:03.318
But there's one thing
I think about all the time.

36:03.319 --> 36:04.999
I can't get it out of my head.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.038
And it's how we got it wrong.

36:07.039 --> 36:08.599
Got what wrong?

36:08.600 --> 36:10.119
Jim Miller.

36:11.479 --> 36:13.679
You know, we should've just
thrown him over that cliff

36:13.680 --> 36:15.319
while we had the chance, mate.

36:16.759 --> 36:18.838
But we were merciful, weren't we?

36:18.839 --> 36:21.280
Yeah, we did what good people do.

36:23.800 --> 36:28.118
But if... if I could go back
and change it, three years,

36:28.119 --> 36:30.118
then I would.

36:30.119 --> 36:32.719
'Cause he's out there, isn't he?

36:32.720 --> 36:36.638
Still... living.

36:36.639 --> 36:38.479
And free.

36:40.239 --> 36:43.478
You know, and after all the
talking and all the counselling,

36:43.479 --> 36:47.119
this anger, it's not going
anywhere - it's getting worse.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.079
We weren't wrong.

37:09.800 --> 37:11.680
You sure you're ready for this?

37:15.680 --> 37:18.599
This is a list of
people invited to the party.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.599
Can you put together
addresses and profiles?

37:20.600 --> 37:22.720
We need to take a
DNA sample from everyone.

37:22.759 --> 37:24.679
- Sure. Shouldn't take long.
- I want it done thoroughly.

37:24.680 --> 37:28.038
Well, I wasn't planning
on doing it shitly.

37:28.039 --> 37:30.799
Miller! Trish is here for her interview.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.800
Thank you, Katie.

37:34.959 --> 37:37.158
God, she really sets my teeth on edge.

37:37.159 --> 37:39.319
Really? You hide it so well.

37:51.680 --> 37:53.518
Uh, Trish, you understand this is

37:53.519 --> 37:55.519
the video evidence that will go forward

37:55.560 --> 37:58.238
as your definitive statement
on what happened,

37:58.239 --> 38:01.038
including in court
if the case is taken that far.

38:01.039 --> 38:03.159
- Yes.
- OK.

38:05.079 --> 38:08.559
Can you tell us exactly what you
wore that night to the party?

38:08.560 --> 38:12.758
Um, a kinda blue flowery dress

38:12.759 --> 38:14.999
over leggings.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.999
Wedge shoes.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.078
Bit of a blingy thing round my neck.

38:20.079 --> 38:21.919
Dangly earrings.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.119
And what underwear did you have on?

38:26.119 --> 38:28.919
Sorry, Trish. It's important
we have these details.

38:28.920 --> 38:33.958
Uh, M&S purple bra and pants.
They were new.

38:33.959 --> 38:36.399
How did you get to the party?

38:36.400 --> 38:40.238
I ordered a minicab from Budmouth Taxis.

38:40.239 --> 38:42.158
- A male driver?
- Lucas, yeah.

38:42.159 --> 38:44.038
He's driven me before.

38:44.039 --> 38:46.158
We'd... we'd actually...

38:46.159 --> 38:48.199
been for a drink once.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.758
Sort of by accident.

38:49.759 --> 38:51.999
I think he thought...

38:52.000 --> 38:53.999
I had to turn him down.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.359
This was the first time
I'd seen him since.

38:56.360 --> 38:58.638
And who did you talk to at the party?

38:58.639 --> 39:00.279
Everyone.

39:00.280 --> 39:02.118
Oh, we'll need names, please, Trish.

39:02.119 --> 39:04.479
Anyone you can remember,
including the women.

39:06.479 --> 39:08.560
Cath, obviously.

39:08.600 --> 39:11.478
Jim, obviously. Uh...

39:11.479 --> 39:13.519
Ian was there.
I didn't talk to Sarah.

39:14.639 --> 39:16.518
Ed Burnett.

39:16.519 --> 39:19.438
I spent most of the time with a
couple of other girls from work,

39:19.439 --> 39:20.878
Sally and Tina.

39:20.879 --> 39:23.038
And that's everyone
you talked to all night?

39:23.039 --> 39:25.279
That's who I remember, yeah.

39:25.280 --> 39:28.079
OK. What did you have to eat and drink?

39:28.119 --> 39:30.959
Eat - not much.

39:31.920 --> 39:35.158
Couple of bits of quiche
and some peanuts.

39:35.159 --> 39:37.199
Drink - I was on white wine.

39:37.200 --> 39:40.359
Oh, and Tina bought me vodka tonics.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.560
How many of each?

39:42.600 --> 39:47.399
Uh, wine... I don't know.
Three, four glasses.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.680
Vodkas... two.

39:50.720 --> 39:54.359
Oh, wait, and before I went outside,

39:54.360 --> 39:59.199
the girls had tequila shots -
two tequila shots.

39:59.200 --> 40:03.038
Sounds a lot when you add it up.

40:03.039 --> 40:05.600
Especially on an empty stomach.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.519
And what time did you go outside?

40:12.560 --> 40:14.758
Oh, I'm not really sure.

40:14.759 --> 40:17.158
About 10:45, 11:00.

40:17.159 --> 40:19.800
I wasn't really looking.
They were still serving.

40:20.920 --> 40:23.559
And what happened
when you went outside?

40:23.560 --> 40:25.039
Uh...

40:26.200 --> 40:28.399
Ian, my husband, came out.

40:28.400 --> 40:31.118
Had a go at me about
the cigarette, about drinking.

40:31.119 --> 40:33.279
I told him where to go, again.

40:33.280 --> 40:36.318
He went off. I finished my fag.

40:36.319 --> 40:40.319
I... I heard someone cough nearby.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.238
Then I think someone called my name.

40:46.239 --> 40:49.919
Or they just said, "Hey."

40:49.920 --> 40:51.559
I'm not sure.

40:51.560 --> 40:52.999
Which was it, Trish?

40:53.000 --> 40:55.319
I don't know.

40:56.239 --> 40:58.318
I walked a bit down the path.

40:58.319 --> 41:04.118
And then it felt like I was
punched in the back of the head

41:04.119 --> 41:06.359
or maybe hit with something.

41:06.360 --> 41:09.518
And did it feel like a fist
or the flat of a hand

41:09.519 --> 41:11.118
or more like an object?

41:11.119 --> 41:13.118
Not a flat hand, no -
it was more like a...

41:13.119 --> 41:15.119
dunno, a piece of wood or something.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.759
And what do you remember next?

41:21.360 --> 41:26.478
I was on my back
with my hands tied under me.

41:26.479 --> 41:29.360
And I couldn't breathe properly.
There was something in my mouth.

41:30.800 --> 41:33.239
And... my shoes were off.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.078
My leggings had been pulled down.

41:36.079 --> 41:41.479
And a... a man... was having sex with me.

41:44.280 --> 41:46.518
Trish, I know this is
gonna be very difficult,

41:46.519 --> 41:50.079
but I need you to explain
exactly what you mean by that.

41:51.239 --> 41:55.319
He had his... penis...

41:56.200 --> 41:58.399
inside my vagina.

41:58.400 --> 42:03.919
And he was moving...
back and forwards.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.518
It... it was rough.

42:06.519 --> 42:09.039
He hurt me. Inside.

42:12.039 --> 42:14.078
And do you know who that person was?

42:14.079 --> 42:16.238
No. No, he covered my eyes.

42:16.239 --> 42:20.599
I tried to struggle, but then he
banged my head into the floor.

42:20.600 --> 42:25.118
And that... that's
the last thing I remember.

42:25.119 --> 42:27.759
And what's the next thing
that you do remember?

42:28.920 --> 42:31.238
Walking through a field.

42:31.239 --> 42:33.518
My head was pounding.

42:33.519 --> 42:36.400
The sun was coming up.
My legs were hurting.

42:38.159 --> 42:40.438
Yeah, I think that's how I got home.

42:40.439 --> 42:44.680
Can you tell us what you
did when you got home?

42:46.519 --> 42:51.478
Did you bathe or have anything
to drink or clean your teeth?

42:51.479 --> 42:52.919
No.

42:52.920 --> 42:56.078
And again... I'm sorry to ask you this,

42:56.079 --> 42:57.758
but when was the last time

42:57.759 --> 43:00.000
you had sex with a man
before this happened?

43:02.600 --> 43:05.119
Do I have to answer that?

43:07.000 --> 43:10.200
Well, it's quite important.
It would really help us.

43:17.639 --> 43:19.680
It was that morning.

43:22.400 --> 43:23.800
Saturday morning.

43:25.319 --> 43:27.279
Can you tell us who it was with?

43:27.280 --> 43:30.119
Well, it's nothing to
do with what happened.

43:30.159 --> 43:32.158
- Was it consensual?
- Yes.

43:32.159 --> 43:35.079
- And was it protected sex?
- No.

43:37.280 --> 43:40.478
Um, it would really help us
if you could tell us who...

43:40.479 --> 43:42.800
- But it's not connected.
- Just to rule them out.

43:42.839 --> 43:44.518
- No.
- Please, Trish.

43:44.519 --> 43:46.518
Alright, fine. It was a stranger.

43:46.519 --> 43:48.878
- It was someone I met online.
- Trish, are you sure about that?

43:48.879 --> 43:50.279
I want to stop the interview.

43:50.280 --> 43:52.519
- Not yet.
- I said I want to stop.

44:07.400 --> 44:09.279
Please don't say "I told you so".

44:09.280 --> 44:11.999
Well, we couldn't delay
getting her evidence any longer.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.199
Why does she not wanna tell
us who she slept with?

44:14.200 --> 44:15.838
How does that make sense to her?

44:15.839 --> 44:17.279
Why'd she not tell us beforehand?

44:17.280 --> 44:18.919
Do you believe it was a stranger

44:18.920 --> 44:20.439
she met on a dating app?

44:22.680 --> 44:24.239
Do you?

44:25.680 --> 44:27.478
Why would she lie?

44:27.479 --> 44:28.879
See, now I'm thinking

44:28.920 --> 44:30.519
what else isn't Trish telling us?

45:14.560 --> 45:17.078
- Hi, you.
- Hi, Dad.

45:17.079 --> 45:19.238
I wasn't expecting to see you tonight.

45:19.239 --> 45:21.999
I need to talk to you about something.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.638
Just between us. Can I come in?

45:24.639 --> 45:27.639
<i>I said about half an ounce of...</i>
