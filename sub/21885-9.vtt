WEBVTT

00:01.377 --> 00:05.298
OK, I don't know about you guys,
but I say we leave this miserable shirthole.

00:05.340 --> 00:07.217
No, wait, wait. Not so fast.

00:07.258 --> 00:10.470
Now, getting to the Good Place
is pretty tricky

00:10.512 --> 00:11.930
there's no train to catch.

00:12.180 --> 00:16.518
I have to design a complicated,
unique transportation vehicle.

00:16.768 --> 00:17.936
Is it Optimus Prime?

00:18.186 --> 00:20.647
What?
- I can't believe we get to ride a real-life

00:20.688 --> 00:22.482
Optimus Prime! I call right nipple!

00:22.524 --> 00:24.776
That's "Shotgun" on Optimus Prime.

00:24.817 --> 00:28.947
Look, this vehicle, which is decidedly not
Optimus Prime...

00:28.988 --> 00:30.031
Aw!

00:30.073 --> 00:33.326
...has never been built before.
So, I'm gonna need a few days to do this.

00:33.368 --> 00:35.703
Dude, we just escaped
by the skin of our teeth

00:35.745 --> 00:39.332
and any second now, Shawn is gonna realise
that we are not at Mindy St Clair's.

00:39.499 --> 00:42.919
So, whatever this magical
Good Place-mobile is

00:42.961 --> 00:44.754
now's the time to whip it out, B!

00:44.796 --> 00:47.423
I agree. And although I believe
I've asked you this question already...

00:47.465 --> 00:48.883
There is no "business class."

00:49.342 --> 00:50.802
Michael, they're right. We gotta go.

00:53.805 --> 00:55.139
Oh. Let's do...

00:55.598 --> 00:58.017
OK, here goes nothing. Janet, if you would?

00:58.434 --> 01:01.563
Aaaand presto!

01:02.188 --> 01:03.773
Oops.

01:04.274 --> 01:05.441
Forgot to log in first.

01:05.817 --> 01:08.069
Gotta answer my, uh... security question.

01:08.111 --> 01:10.738
"What was the name of your childhood pet?"

01:11.114 --> 01:12.991
Korzoff... the Ten-Headed...

01:13.408 --> 01:14.576
Dog-Spider.

01:14.617 --> 01:17.161
Aaaand presto!

01:19.622 --> 01:21.040
Dope!

01:21.624 --> 01:22.834
We did it, guys.

01:22.875 --> 01:23.751
We won.

01:23.835 --> 01:25.670
We're going to the Good Place.

01:25.712 --> 01:27.672
In a frickin' gold balloon!

01:27.714 --> 01:28.590
Shotgun!

01:28.631 --> 01:30.717
It's a hot air balloon,
what does that even mean?

01:30.758 --> 01:34.304
Top of the balloon! Ultimate shotgun.

01:41.853 --> 01:43.730
Guys, just a reminder

01:43.771 --> 01:46.816
I have no idea what's going to happen
once we actually

01:46.858 --> 01:48.568
reach the Good Place.

01:48.610 --> 01:52.488
You know, we're trying to slip in
through a kind of side door

01:52.989 --> 01:54.365
and even if that works

01:54.782 --> 01:57.118
we have no way of knowing
if they'll let us stay.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.454
Of course they'll let us stay -
we're refugees.

01:59.495 --> 02:02.165
I mean, what kind of a messed-up place
would turn away refugees?

02:02.206 --> 02:03.958
Quite agree. We should get a move on.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.836
Obviously, if I'd known we'd be ballooning,
I would've worn a proper ballooning outfit

02:06.878 --> 02:08.713
but time is of the essence, so...

02:09.547 --> 02:11.841
Tahani. Yeah, no, no, don't.
Don't touch that.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.259
It's probably locked.

02:13.509 --> 02:15.261
It's a very complicated control system.

02:15.303 --> 02:18.181
I may need a few minutes
to get a handle on this.

02:19.390 --> 02:21.851
Why don't you all go say goodbye
to the Neighbourhood?

02:21.893 --> 02:24.395
Oh, then I could change into a proper
ballooning outfit!

02:24.437 --> 02:25.521
Oh, hurrah!

02:26.356 --> 02:27.649
Are you making fun of me?

02:27.815 --> 02:30.276
No, I legit wanna see you in that outfit.

02:30.360 --> 02:31.235
Oh!

02:36.324 --> 02:38.326
So many memories of this place -

02:38.368 --> 02:40.870
eating frozen yogurt and then having diarrhea

02:40.912 --> 02:42.538
and then eating more frozen yogurt

02:42.580 --> 02:43.790
and then more diarrhea.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.668
Maybe I should've realized this wasn't
the Good Place

02:46.709 --> 02:47.919
because of all the diarrhea.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.546
Maybe you shouldn't be eating all that
frozen yogurt right now.

02:50.922 --> 02:52.632
We're about to be on a balloon, man.

02:52.799 --> 02:54.926
What do you think our new home will be like?

02:54.967 --> 02:58.137
I'm picturing Hawaiian beach,
unlimited Mai Tais

02:58.971 --> 03:00.056
and a phone!

03:00.515 --> 03:04.352
Ugh, I miss my phone so much.
I bet I have so many texts.

03:04.394 --> 03:07.230
I just want us all to be together.
Separate houses, obviously.

03:07.730 --> 03:08.773
Large lawns.

03:08.898 --> 03:10.650
I'd have a tasteful moat.

03:11.150 --> 03:15.238
I don't care where I live, as long as
they have more of this frozen yogurt.

03:15.530 --> 03:16.698
Why? Why?

03:16.864 --> 03:18.950
An unlimited library

03:19.742 --> 03:21.828
all of my philosopher heroes walking around

03:21.869 --> 03:24.247
waiting to be engaged in rigorous
intellectual debate.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.666
And I hope that library is air-conditioned

03:26.708 --> 03:29.585
because we are gonna be working up
quite a sweat!

03:29.836 --> 03:31.129
Oh! And soulmates!

03:31.170 --> 03:32.380
I hope they're real.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.133
I mean... you know...

03:35.174 --> 03:36.467
for... for all of us.

03:36.843 --> 03:39.345
I mean, I hope everyone gets someone special.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.513
Uh, mm...

03:40.555 --> 03:43.141
Good news!
We've got a handle on the controls.

03:43.516 --> 03:45.184
Who's ready to go ballooning?

03:45.393 --> 03:47.270
OK, I think we figured it out.

03:47.645 --> 03:51.315
I pieced together this design
from a number of ancient manuscripts

03:51.357 --> 03:53.025
which Janet will now interpret for you.

03:53.317 --> 03:57.113
"The balloon will only transport those
who have attained self-realisation."

03:57.238 --> 04:00.825
"Each traveler will step upon the scale,
and her soul shall be weighed."

04:00.867 --> 04:04.287
"If she is the best version of herself,
it will permit her to board."

04:04.495 --> 04:06.456
"If not, passage will be denied."

04:07.039 --> 04:07.915
Cool.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.167
Cool. Cool.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.084
We got this.

04:10.376 --> 04:14.464
I don't know about you guys, but I am
definitely the best version of myself.

04:14.505 --> 04:18.509
I know a shirt-ton about ethics now,
because I studied.

04:18.551 --> 04:23.139
And I read books, that weren't even written
by the "Real Housewives."

04:23.514 --> 04:26.642
Relax, everyone. We're all gonna be fine.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.608
Oh, man, I didn't believe anything
I was saying. I just...

04:33.649 --> 04:34.817
Whoo! In I go.

04:39.155 --> 04:41.115
Well, I mean...

04:47.288 --> 04:48.164
Oh, dip!

04:52.460 --> 04:53.836
Ah, nuts!

04:53.878 --> 04:54.754
It's OK!

04:54.796 --> 04:56.798
The pattern is "green-green-green-red."

04:56.839 --> 04:58.549
Remember that when it starts up again.

04:58.591 --> 04:59.717
I'm sorry, everyone.

04:59.759 --> 05:03.429
I just have some worries,
as well as some concerns

05:03.471 --> 05:05.139
that could potentially turn into
outright fears.

05:05.181 --> 05:07.016
Ah, there they go. Ah, they're...

05:07.058 --> 05:08.434
they're fears now. I'm scared.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.019
OK, I know this mood.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.730
Come with us, Doctor Freak-Out.

05:13.022 --> 05:15.942
That was a joke.
We're actually very good friends.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.318
OK, here's the thing.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.823
That balloon wants us to be the best version
of ourselves, but for the four of us

05:21.864 --> 05:23.032
that's not just a metaphor.

05:23.074 --> 05:26.661
It doesn't just mean, "are we the nicest
that we've ever been?" or something

05:26.702 --> 05:29.247
although I am also worried about that.

05:29.288 --> 05:34.710
But the real issue here is that there have
been literally 802 different versions of us!

05:34.752 --> 05:37.588
And how do I know that this version
is the best version of myself?

05:37.630 --> 05:39.882
How do I know it's not version number 85?

05:39.924 --> 05:42.051
Or 322? Or 558?

05:42.093 --> 05:43.636
Or 69 or 420!

05:43.803 --> 05:46.055
You know, and... and then you get
into the whole idea of...

05:46.097 --> 05:48.474
of consciousness. And, I mean,
just forget about "best"

05:48.516 --> 05:50.434
what version of Chidi is even real?

05:50.476 --> 05:54.272
I mean, I think that "I" am here,
but what if the real "I"

05:54.313 --> 05:56.691
is one of those other Chidis, and... and...

05:56.732 --> 05:58.526
and this Chidi is an imposter!

05:58.568 --> 06:00.736
What happens here?
Does he eventually tire himself out?

06:00.778 --> 06:02.196
Usually, but this one seems to be

06:02.238 --> 06:04.198
getting stronger as he goes on.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.242
...over time, because our consciousness
is constantly changing.

06:06.284 --> 06:08.828
Which is just playing on the Buddhist
doctrine of the "non-self."

06:08.870 --> 06:11.664
Plus, physically, our cells change
every seven years, which doesn't matter

06:11.706 --> 06:13.040
because we're dead.

06:13.082 --> 06:15.251
OK. This is pretty simple, bud.

06:15.543 --> 06:19.797
You've been our teacher this whole time
and we are much better because of you.

06:20.172 --> 06:24.135
If we're the best versions of ourselves,
which that balloon just proved

06:24.969 --> 06:26.762
then you definitely are.

06:27.305 --> 06:28.848
So, in a way, it...

06:28.890 --> 06:33.185
it doesn't matter if I was "better"
in version 492 or whatever

06:33.227 --> 06:35.354
because the best version of "me"

06:35.396 --> 06:38.149
is just as much about my effect
on the world around me

06:38.190 --> 06:41.903
as it is about my own egocentric self-image.

06:42.987 --> 06:44.822
I really meant that much to you guys?

06:44.864 --> 06:46.032
Of course you did.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.659
Now let's get you back on that scale, dorkus!

06:53.789 --> 06:56.834
Oh, good, you're back.
I had Janet make some food for the trip.

06:56.876 --> 06:57.919
Twizzlers for Jason.

06:58.669 --> 07:00.212
Shrimp for Eleanor.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.006
Chidi, hard-boiled eggs.

07:02.048 --> 07:06.260
And for Tahani, Lord Vivian's
Vinegar-Drenched Cuttlefish Crisps.

07:06.302 --> 07:08.346
Oh, my favourite savoury dessert!

07:08.930 --> 07:10.681
Oh, un-pickled...

07:11.307 --> 07:12.183
No, thank you.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.602
Chidi? Ready to try again?

07:15.353 --> 07:16.479
Yeah, all right.

07:20.816 --> 07:21.734
Yeah!

07:31.702 --> 07:32.745
Dope!

07:37.541 --> 07:38.542
Ugh!

07:38.584 --> 07:40.252
Chidi got in my head!

07:41.587 --> 07:44.799
It's just that thing Chidi said
about previous versions of myself

07:44.840 --> 07:46.884
it's screwing me up, but I can fix it.

07:49.220 --> 07:50.221
Phew!

07:50.262 --> 07:52.765
I stole this from your house
the first night we were here.

07:52.807 --> 07:55.226
OK. Should be the best version of myself now.

07:57.061 --> 07:59.522
Urgh! Come on, scale! Be cool!

07:59.563 --> 08:00.773
Guys, we're just not ready.

08:00.815 --> 08:02.733
I think we should regroup,
and try again tomorrow--

08:02.775 --> 08:03.943
Hang on. I know the answer.

08:03.985 --> 08:05.444
I know why I'm not my best self.

08:06.362 --> 08:09.991
Do you remember that version of me,
from the tape of us, at Mindy's?

08:10.616 --> 08:15.037
Where I was vulnerable
and emotional, and honest?

08:15.913 --> 08:19.291
That Eleanor is a better Eleanor
than this one.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.752
And that is not an easy thing for me to say.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.755
"You're not better than me"
was my yearbook quote.

08:25.881 --> 08:28.426
Michael, can you tell us a little bit
about that version?

08:28.467 --> 08:31.137
Uh... reboot number 119.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.889
All the restaurants were kebab places.

08:33.931 --> 08:36.892
You had a pet lizard, which I made
poop on you all the time.

08:36.934 --> 08:39.895
No, can you tell us more about
Chidi's and my relationship

08:39.937 --> 08:41.022
from that version?

08:41.063 --> 08:43.566
Right. Sorry.
Well, you got really into ethics

08:43.607 --> 08:45.568
and you spent a lot of time together.

08:46.152 --> 08:49.780
Once, you handed him a tissue
right before he sneezed

08:49.822 --> 08:54.660
and that simple act of anticipating his needs
made him fall for you.

08:54.702 --> 08:59.999
One night you took a walk along the lake,
and you had your first kiss

09:00.458 --> 09:04.170
which... gross. Kissing is gross.

09:04.754 --> 09:07.298
You just mash your food-holes together.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.799
It's not for that!

09:09.550 --> 09:12.678
Anyway, it, uh... it just... you know...

09:12.720 --> 09:14.388
bloomed after that.

09:14.597 --> 09:17.641
Look. There are obviously
some undealt-with issues here.

09:17.683 --> 09:22.063
I propose that everyone who is "green"
go ahead and board the magic balloon

09:22.104 --> 09:23.606
and set out to the Good Place.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.399
You know, sort of like an advance team.

09:25.441 --> 09:28.360
We'll put our names in, or book a table,
however it works

09:28.402 --> 09:31.697
and then we'll send back the magical balloon
for the "red-light people" later on.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.074
It's a perfect plan.

09:35.451 --> 09:36.368
No!

09:36.410 --> 09:38.329
It's not working,
it probably thinks I'm Eleanor.

09:38.662 --> 09:41.207
It is I, Tahani!

09:41.332 --> 09:42.333
Wait! Wait!

09:42.958 --> 09:45.669
I'm not really my best self, guys.

09:47.505 --> 09:51.801
Tahani keeps trying to talk to me about
our relationship, but I keep dodging it.

09:51.842 --> 09:53.803
Plus I haven't talked to Janet
about me and her yet.

09:54.178 --> 09:57.264
And I haven't talked to Michael
about the band I want us to start

09:57.306 --> 09:58.682
"The Rock and Roll Buddies."

09:58.724 --> 09:59.975
Yes, actually you did.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.602
I said, uh... I wasn't interested.

10:01.644 --> 10:05.689
In case you were wondering,
I am by definition the best version of myself

10:05.731 --> 10:07.733
because my operating system
is always updating.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.693
I'm not sure that's true, Janet.

10:09.735 --> 10:12.530
You still haven't talked to Jason
about your romantic baggage.

10:12.571 --> 10:15.991
And the three of you
are in some sort of weird love triangle.

10:16.033 --> 10:19.203
You don't know what you're talking about.
Also, love isn't a triangle.

10:19.245 --> 10:21.163
It's a five-dimensional blob. So...

10:21.205 --> 10:23.707
OK, if you're so perfect, step on the scale.
- Fine.

10:26.502 --> 10:28.337
- Ooh! I think I broke it.
- No!

10:28.379 --> 10:29.797
My beautiful balloon scale!

10:29.839 --> 10:30.923
It's not yours!

10:30.965 --> 10:32.883
No, no, please, stop fighting!

10:32.925 --> 10:35.219
Ah, man. This... this stinks.

10:35.511 --> 10:37.596
I'm having this feeling where...
what is it called?

10:37.638 --> 10:38.973
You know where you, uh...

10:39.014 --> 10:41.725
you did a thing and you're sad after it?
What...

10:41.767 --> 10:42.935
"After-sad"? Is that...

10:42.977 --> 10:46.313
No. Gah!
You humans have so many emotions.

10:46.355 --> 10:47.773
You only need two -

10:47.857 --> 10:49.650
anger and confusion!

10:49.692 --> 10:51.277
Michael, what's going on?

10:51.318 --> 10:53.237
The problem isn't any of you.

10:53.279 --> 10:54.530
It...

10:54.572 --> 10:56.615
This whole balloon thing is a fake.

10:56.657 --> 10:59.952
The truth is, I have no idea
how to get into the Good Place

10:59.994 --> 11:01.162
and I never have.

11:04.665 --> 11:05.958
Well, Michael's right.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.879
I'm angry and confused.

11:12.715 --> 11:17.094
So, months ago, when you said
you had this whole complicated plan

11:17.136 --> 11:19.054
for getting us to the Good Place...?
- It was a lie.

11:19.305 --> 11:23.058
I assumed if I bought myself some time,
I could figure out a way in.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.478
Guys, I tried a billion different ways.

11:26.520 --> 11:30.816
Not an exaggeration - I actually tried
one billion and 12 different plans

11:30.858 --> 11:36.197
but the only way into the Good Place
is by being a good person on Earth.

11:36.238 --> 11:39.366
This is unforgivable. How many times
can you betray us?

11:39.575 --> 11:41.368
I'm sorry. I really am.

11:41.410 --> 11:43.996
Because while I was searching
for a way to get in

11:44.330 --> 11:46.540
I was also taking your ethics classes

11:46.749 --> 11:48.834
learning why it was bad to lie.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.921
So not only did I fail at getting us
into the Good Place

11:51.962 --> 11:54.673
I also learned the "error of my ways."

11:54.715 --> 11:58.135
Real rock bottom for a demon, I'll tell ya.

11:58.219 --> 12:01.222
So... how did you know
that I would doubt myself

12:01.263 --> 12:03.057
and make the scale turn red?

12:03.098 --> 12:04.767
I mean, at the risk of seeming blunt

12:05.643 --> 12:08.646
I'm a puppet master
and you have long been my puppets.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.397
But this was not torture!

12:10.439 --> 12:13.859
I... I was stalling,
so I could keep searching for a way in.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.987
I would have been happy if you were to live
in this Neighbourhood forever

12:17.029 --> 12:20.324
but then Shawn came and... and...
and just ruined the whole thing.

12:21.158 --> 12:22.952
So, what happens now?

12:23.327 --> 12:25.913
Shawn will eventually figure out
you're not at Mindy's.

12:25.955 --> 12:31.168
And he'll realize that someone on the inside
was helping you.

12:31.335 --> 12:35.047
So, you'll go to the real Bad Place forever,
and I will be...

12:35.214 --> 12:36.090
be retired.

12:36.131 --> 12:37.132
You're... you're mad at me.

12:37.925 --> 12:38.884
I'm not mad.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.512
I'm just disappointed.

12:41.553 --> 12:44.265
Aw, come on, everyone knows that's worse.

12:44.306 --> 12:48.602
So, this really is the end.
Completely out of options, are we?

12:48.978 --> 12:51.563
Not completely out of options.

12:52.398 --> 12:57.319
We can do what the Shellstrops
have always done, when the chips are down

12:58.028 --> 13:00.823
ignore our problems and drink heavily.

13:01.699 --> 13:02.574
Janet!

13:02.616 --> 13:05.286
A million bottles
of your finest booze, please.

13:07.913 --> 13:08.789
You alright?

13:10.165 --> 13:14.169
Kinda. I asked Michael if I could pop
the giant balloon

13:14.420 --> 13:15.337
and he said no.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.257
Then I asked if I could suck
the helium out of it

13:18.299 --> 13:20.884
to make my voice sound funny
so it cheers everyone up...

13:21.385 --> 13:24.138
and he just kind of sighed and walked away

13:25.014 --> 13:27.224
so I guess that one is still on the table.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.103
Are you and me cool?

13:31.562 --> 13:32.438
Not exactly.

13:32.771 --> 13:37.234
I think perhaps, given everything,
it's best we end our relationship.

13:38.319 --> 13:42.448
It's probably about time I stopped relying
on others for my sense of self-worth

13:42.740 --> 13:43.741
or happiness.

13:44.658 --> 13:48.287
You know, my whole life,
whenever I encountered any obstacles

13:48.329 --> 13:49.955
I would simply say

13:50.914 --> 13:52.333
"I would like to speak to your manager."

13:53.083 --> 13:55.294
But in our relationship, there is no manager.

13:55.336 --> 13:59.423
There is no one
who can fix this for me, except me.

14:01.050 --> 14:04.887
My mum was a manager at a pet store.
Does that help?

14:05.262 --> 14:07.848
No, and please don't launch
into one of your long stories.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.266
She got fired
- No, Jason...

14:09.308 --> 14:11.268
after I robbed the pet store
- Please, please, please, please, Jason.

14:11.310 --> 14:13.228
where she worked. We robbed it together.
- No, no, no, no, no. Please, stop.

14:13.270 --> 14:16.106
Long story short, it was all a dream.

14:16.982 --> 14:21.278
Thank you, Jason, for making this moment
a little easier, for me.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.200
Dude, here's where I'm at -

14:26.241 --> 14:27.534
feelings are stupid.

14:28.452 --> 14:29.828
Yeah. Who needs them?

14:29.870 --> 14:35.209
But, uh... in case feelings aren't stupid,
and, in the case that we are

14:35.250 --> 14:38.170
eternally doomed, I thought
it might be worth mentioning that I do...

14:40.214 --> 14:41.548
have feelings for you.

14:42.091 --> 14:43.801
And I... I know you don't feel the same way.

14:43.842 --> 14:45.886
And although that fills me with...

14:46.929 --> 14:49.431
anger and confusion...

14:50.140 --> 14:51.642
Wow, Michael was right on the money.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.812
I just wanted you to know the truth.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.482
You are... I mean...

14:58.524 --> 15:00.984
- No, no, don't say anything. Don't. Don't.
- I want to, I want to.

15:01.026 --> 15:01.985
I want to.

15:02.528 --> 15:03.404
Here's the thing about me.

15:03.695 --> 15:07.324
You know the sound that a fork makes
in the garbage disposal?

15:08.409 --> 15:13.038
That's the sound that my brain makes,
all the time.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.748
It's just this constant grinding.

15:14.790 --> 15:18.752
About things I'm afraid of,
or things that I want

15:18.794 --> 15:23.132
or want to want, or want to want to...

15:23.173 --> 15:25.300
Is it grinding in there right now, bud?
- Yep.

15:25.342 --> 15:28.512
But the... the point is, the circumstances
under which we met

15:29.179 --> 15:33.851
are completely insane, and that just makes
the grinding harder.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.687
I just wish we'd met the way
normal people meet

15:36.728 --> 15:40.524
like at a philosophy conference, or after one
of my philosophy lectures...

15:40.566 --> 15:42.776
or... or you came knocking

15:42.818 --> 15:45.654
on my office door asking for help
with philosophy.

15:45.696 --> 15:47.573
Is that how you think people meet?

15:48.866 --> 15:50.409
I don't know how normal people meet.

15:53.704 --> 15:55.205
It's not that I couldn't love you.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.124
You're amazing

15:57.166 --> 15:58.041
and...

15:58.542 --> 16:00.085
fearless, and...

16:01.628 --> 16:02.796
and clearly...

16:04.756 --> 16:07.050
symmetrical.

16:08.260 --> 16:09.553
You're such a nerd.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.639
Attention, everyone!

16:13.390 --> 16:18.437
We may not know exactly which version
of ourselves was technically our "best self"

16:18.479 --> 16:19.480
but you know what?

16:19.980 --> 16:21.523
I like who we are right now.

16:21.565 --> 16:23.525
To this version of us.

16:23.734 --> 16:25.569
To the good people we've all become.

16:25.819 --> 16:26.945
Oh, and to Eleanor!

16:27.070 --> 16:28.280
Our unofficial leader.

16:28.906 --> 16:31.992
You pack a lot of heart and grit into that
diminutive frame.

16:32.451 --> 16:34.703
Like a scrappy little auto-mechanic.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.789
That's the nicest thing you've ever said
to me, babe, and I'll take it.

16:37.873 --> 16:39.958
And to Janet! The best robot...

16:40.000 --> 16:41.126
Not a robot.
- Girl...

16:41.168 --> 16:42.961
Not a girl.
- And straight-up hottie...

16:43.003 --> 16:44.254
I am attractive, yes.

16:44.296 --> 16:46.381
...any of us could have ever asked for.

16:46.423 --> 16:47.382
Thanks, guys.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.052
Because of the way
we were conceived of and created

16:50.093 --> 16:52.679
Janets don't typically give speeches.

16:54.765 --> 16:56.433
Oh, she's done.
She's not gonna give a speech.

16:56.475 --> 16:57.351
Oh.
- OK. Cool.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.478
Oh, one more toast! To Michael!

16:59.645 --> 17:00.729
Michael!

17:01.980 --> 17:05.776
Who is easily the best version of himself

17:05.901 --> 17:07.069
granted the bar was low.

17:07.110 --> 17:08.737
Mm-hmm.
- He is a demon.

17:08.779 --> 17:09.738
- Mm...
- But...

17:09.780 --> 17:12.241
he made a mistake and admitted he was wrong

17:12.282 --> 17:15.536
which makes him better than 90%
of all humans.

17:15.577 --> 17:17.496
And you know what?
It wasn't really Michael's fault.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.457
We weren't getting
into the Good Place anyway.

17:20.541 --> 17:21.833
I mean, look at us -

17:22.084 --> 17:23.710
a self-obsessed socialite

17:24.211 --> 17:25.587
a ridiculous giraffe

17:25.629 --> 17:29.633
an absurd British aristocrat,
a narcissistic attention-seeker--

17:29.675 --> 17:31.009
Are these all me?
- Yes.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.178
I was gonna do eight for you,
and one for everyone else.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.264
The point is, Michael...

17:35.514 --> 17:36.390
we forgive you.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.810
I mean, at least you tried to find a way
to the Good Place.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.187
And that's the greatest thing someone can do

17:42.229 --> 17:43.814
just try your best.

17:45.107 --> 17:50.696
So, we hereby name you
an "honourary human"

17:51.196 --> 17:56.118
and we would like to present you
with this Human Starter Kit.

17:56.410 --> 18:00.664
Car keys! So I can lose them and say,
"Has anyone seen my car keys?"

18:00.706 --> 18:03.959
Oh, and then I can do that, you know,
that thing where you... you...

18:04.001 --> 18:05.043
Thank you!

18:05.085 --> 18:09.715
And Band-Aids,
for your stupid fragile bodies.

18:09.756 --> 18:13.969
Oh, and look at this - a stress ball
with a dumb corporate logo?

18:14.386 --> 18:16.555
Oh, I can't wait to keep finding this

18:16.597 --> 18:18.432
and then almost throw it away, and then think

18:18.473 --> 18:20.183
"No, I'll... I'll use it!"

18:22.060 --> 18:23.478
Oh... guys.

18:24.521 --> 18:27.941
A Doctor Oz diet book,
because you're all such suckers.

18:27.983 --> 18:31.987
This is all garbage
that I have no real use for.

18:32.029 --> 18:34.323
That's right. Welcome to being human, buddy.

18:34.489 --> 18:35.449
To Michael.

18:38.910 --> 18:41.622
♪ I do my makeup in somebody else's car ♪

18:46.460 --> 18:50.672
♪ We order different drinks
at the same bars... ♪

18:57.554 --> 19:06.021
♪ Unforgettable
That's what you are ♪

19:08.440 --> 19:10.275
♪ Unforgettable... ♪

19:10.317 --> 19:11.735
- You don't remember?
- No!

19:11.777 --> 19:13.278
No, of course you don't.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.571
Oh, that's mean.

19:14.613 --> 19:17.282
That was version one.

19:18.784 --> 19:19.660
Michael...

19:19.701 --> 19:21.703
there's a message coming in from Shawn.

19:21.745 --> 19:24.247
"Finish shutting everything down."

19:24.289 --> 19:26.500
"Sending train first thing tomorrow."

19:27.167 --> 19:30.545
"Humans will be captured and tortured soup."

19:31.296 --> 19:33.006
"Sorry, autocorrect."

19:33.090 --> 19:34.216
"Soon."

19:34.257 --> 19:37.719
"Although weirdly I did just finish turning
someone into soup."

19:38.261 --> 19:39.304
"So random."

19:39.346 --> 19:40.514
"OK, bye."

19:43.350 --> 19:46.478
What do you guys think the Bad Place
is going to be, for you?

19:46.937 --> 19:48.980
I'll probably go to a Skrillex concert

19:49.606 --> 19:51.608
and I'll be waiting for the bass drop.

19:52.484 --> 19:53.360
And it...

19:55.570 --> 19:56.655
it'll never come.

19:57.781 --> 19:59.074
For me, it'll be camping.

19:59.574 --> 20:01.910
Like, I'll just always be camping.

20:02.244 --> 20:05.288
I'm pretty good at turning
every place I go in...

20:05.330 --> 20:06.957
into my personal hell, so

20:08.041 --> 20:10.377
I think they'll have a lot
of options, for me.

20:10.419 --> 20:14.715
Mine will obviously be an eternity
spent in the Swiss Alps.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.216
That sounds amazing.

20:16.591 --> 20:19.594
In Autumn. The off-season!

20:19.636 --> 20:21.054
Yeah, still fine.

20:21.096 --> 20:22.139
You'd be fine.

20:22.431 --> 20:25.642
Who are we kidding, you'll probably
be running the place in, like, a week.

20:25.684 --> 20:26.560
She'll be like...

20:26.601 --> 20:29.396
"Oh, hibbledy-dibbledy!
This simply won't do!"

20:29.438 --> 20:31.940
"I demand to speak to your manager."

20:31.982 --> 20:34.359
- Again, again!
- "Your manager!"

20:36.111 --> 20:38.155
Of course! That's it.

20:39.197 --> 20:40.866
We should speak to the manager!

20:40.907 --> 20:43.577
Wait, you said that there was a judge

20:43.618 --> 20:47.205
who decides on disputes between
the Good Place and the Bad Place, right?

20:47.247 --> 20:51.752
Some sort of "head honcho" I could
pace in front of, and plead our case to

20:51.793 --> 20:54.921
and maybe even wag a finger at,
disapprovingly?

20:54.963 --> 20:57.299
I thought about that, it's a non-starter.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.426
Judge rarely hears cases.

20:59.468 --> 21:03.263
And the only way to get to the Judge's office
is through a portal

21:03.847 --> 21:06.266
and we can never get to that.

21:06.725 --> 21:07.642
Well, why not?

21:07.684 --> 21:11.980
We'd have to walk through the actual
Bad Place, in plain sight

21:12.022 --> 21:16.026
without getting caught,
reach and pass through the portal

21:16.067 --> 21:19.821
which is in the very centre
of Bad Place headquarters

21:19.863 --> 21:22.073
convince the Judge to hear us out

21:22.115 --> 21:24.785
even though we didn't go through
the proper channels

21:25.118 --> 21:29.122
and then somehow win our unwinnable case.

21:31.583 --> 21:32.918
OK.

21:33.960 --> 21:34.878
Let's do it.

21:36.546 --> 21:37.547
You're serious?

21:37.589 --> 21:39.925
Yeah! What do we have to lose?

21:43.887 --> 21:48.308
All I've really ever wanted was to know
what it feels like to be human.

21:48.809 --> 21:51.770
And now, we're going to do the most
human thing of all

21:52.354 --> 21:56.733
attempt something futile,
with a ton of unearned confidence

21:56.775 --> 21:59.236
and fail spectacularly!

21:59.444 --> 22:00.612
Get up! Get up!

22:00.862 --> 22:01.863
Everyone!

22:03.198 --> 22:04.449
Get rest tonight.

22:05.200 --> 22:08.870
First thing tomorrow...
we're going to the Bad Place.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.041
We had a lot of good times together.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.168
I'll see you in the next life.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.795
Goodbye, clowns.

22:17.170 --> 22:21.299
Goodbye, modernist architecture
that I was too trashy to appreciate.

22:23.218 --> 22:24.177
Goodbye, house.

22:24.886 --> 22:25.887
Goodbye, house.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.269
What up, idiot?

22:32.561 --> 22:35.856
This is the 8:22 express
to Bad Place Headquarters.

22:35.897 --> 22:39.526
We'd like to begin the boarding process
with our first-class fat dinks

22:39.568 --> 22:41.820
and there is no overhead storage

22:41.862 --> 22:44.155
so if you have any bags,
why don't you just go ahead

22:44.197 --> 22:46.074
and place them up your fat butts.

22:46.116 --> 22:49.119
Sorry about this, Bad Janet.
- Sorry about what, ya fat dink?

22:56.001 --> 22:57.544
This was your life's work.

22:57.919 --> 23:00.380
Are you OK with leaving
the fake Good Place behind?

23:01.089 --> 23:04.843
As long as I'm with you guys,
I'm always in the fake Good Place.

23:05.218 --> 23:07.512
That doesn't sound
as nice as you think it does.

23:09.890 --> 23:14.686
The real Bad Place was the friends
we made along the way.

23:14.728 --> 23:17.689
Nope. Still nonsense. One more try?

23:18.481 --> 23:19.482
In a way

23:19.900 --> 23:24.070
the Good Place was inside the Bad Place...

23:25.488 --> 23:26.406
all along?

23:26.448 --> 23:28.658
You know what? That's technically true,
I'm gonna give it to you.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.410
Ah!

23:30.702 --> 23:31.870
I just made an aphorism.

23:33.955 --> 23:34.956
Hit it, Janet.

23:35.373 --> 23:38.126
Next stop, the actual Bad Place!
