01:08.400 --> 01:10.710
<i>When you fly above New York at night</i>

01:10.920 --> 01:13.640
<i>it's like you're looking down</i>
<i>at millions of stars.</i>

01:14.280 --> 01:17.034
<i>And each star could be the life of a person</i>

01:17.200 --> 01:19.032
<i>who calls this great city home.</i>

01:21.320 --> 01:25.320
<i>My dad told me that people have always</i>
<i>looked at the patterns of the stars</i>

01:25.520 --> 01:28.433
<i>to predict what was going to</i>
<i>happen in their lives,</i>

01:29.080 --> 01:31.390
<i>and if you could understand those patterns,</i>

01:31.680 --> 01:34.960
<i>you'd be able to know what was gonna
happen before anyone else did.</i>

01:37.600 --> 01:39.557
<i>The last time we saw each other</i>

01:39.960 --> 01:44.120
<i>he told me that each star's light
has taken decades to reach us</i>

01:45.120 --> 01:48.557
<i>and how it always burns</i>
<i>brightest right before it dies.</i>

01:52.120 --> 01:54.680
<i>So now, whenever a distant star lights up,</i>

01:55.880 --> 01:58.873
<i>I always feel like somewhere, somehow,</i>

01:59.600 --> 02:01.671
<i>someone's life is about to end.</i>

02:54.800 --> 02:57.714
<i>The Millhurst Express is
now boarding on track 32.</i>

02:58.320 --> 02:59.640
I've missed you.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.954
Stop it right there! Put down your weapon!

03:57.200 --> 03:59.271
<i>Ever had a dream that felt real?</i>

04:09.280 --> 04:11.920
<i>So real, you thought you were awake.</i>

04:16.680 --> 04:18.750
<i>Tonight, New Yorkers have the opportunity</i>

04:18.839 --> 04:21.594
<i>to see a highly unusual event above our city.</i>

04:21.760 --> 04:22.955
<i>Ashley Gains reports.</i>

04:23.080 --> 04:27.519
<i>For the next two weeks, we will
be able to witness a star going nova.</i>

04:27.680 --> 04:29.797
<i>The distant star, known as Hamil,</i>

04:29.880 --> 04:31.792
<i>actually died 30 years ago</i>

04:31.920 --> 04:35.556
<i>but it has taken that long for the
light to reach us, so that...</i>

04:59.600 --> 05:01.034
- Morning, Nicky.
- Hey.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.476
Taxi?

05:24.560 --> 05:25.596
Hey!

06:03.720 --> 06:05.040
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, look.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.751
Alright!

06:16.560 --> 06:19.439
<i>This is a non-Rockaway-bound A Train.</i>

06:56.240 --> 06:58.880
<i>I like order. It somehow soothes me.</i>

07:02.240 --> 07:04.675
<i>Even in the stressful world</i>
<i>of air traffic control.</i>

07:06.120 --> 07:08.760
<i>For me, it's a game</i>
<i>to find order in the chaos.</i>

07:10.000 --> 07:12.310

07:18.360 --> 07:19.589
<i>Good day right back at you, sir.</i>

07:21.360 --> 07:22.953
A lot of metal in the air today, people.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.349
Let's focus, alright?

07:24.800 --> 07:27.952
HA 399 taxi via Delta, Alpha

07:51.520 --> 07:53.193
Okay, here's the first lot of 10 downstairs

07:53.360 --> 07:55.238
that are going to be jammed up
for the next half-hour.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.553
I know you love a bit of chaos.

08:08.760 --> 08:12.037

<i>Pulling her right back.</i>

08:16.680 --> 08:17.875
Don't make me look bad.

08:18.880 --> 08:22.157
You send that metal bitch around and
you owe 10 bucks to the drinking fund.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.198
<i>Awaiting final landing instructions.</i>

08:48.680 --> 08:52.993

<i>UA 39 lands.</i>

09:01.240 --> 09:02.276
Damn!

09:02.720 --> 09:03.790
Attaboy.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.718
Okay, we all know that he never comes out.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.674
But the poor bastard's about
to turn 30 in two weeks

09:19.840 --> 09:23.197
and God knows when we'll lure
him out for another drink.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.355
Here's to the end of youth, pal.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.076
We love you, Dyl.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.834
- Wow.
- I don't.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.230
Thanks, you guys.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.631
Especially Inky for those
incredibly moving words.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.194
I'm a sentimental guy.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.914
Who's up for a smoke?

09:38.080 --> 09:39.480
Ooh, you talked me into it.

09:39.840 --> 09:40.876
Bill?

09:41.040 --> 09:42.759
Hey, I thought you'd quit.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.912
Oh, yeah, I did. Many times.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.560
- Bill!
- I hear you!

09:48.520 --> 09:49.556
You wanna get some air?

09:50.320 --> 09:51.436
Sure.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.279
So, happy birthday.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.797
Mm! Really?

10:01.960 --> 10:03.679
- Mm-hm.
- It's one of those?

10:04.200 --> 10:05.316
Mm-hm.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.120
So, our tradition continues, huh?

10:07.280 --> 10:08.555
You bet it does.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.714
Aerial ballet?

10:13.120 --> 10:14.634
Is that something you can't handle?

10:14.920 --> 10:15.956
It's fine.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.156
- Great.
- Yep.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.876
- And you're coming with me.
- No, I'm not.

10:20.400 --> 10:21.720
- Why not?
- Definitely not.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.475
Well, I'm... I'm seeing someone...

10:25.280 --> 10:28.273
who is quite normal.
It makes for a nice change.

10:28.480 --> 10:29.596
- Ha!
- Mm.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.997
Guess we were never right
for each other, were we?

10:33.480 --> 10:35.039
No, not even close.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.637
Seriously, who am I supposed
to bring to this thing?

10:37.760 --> 10:39.035
I don't know.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.793
But I hope you find her one day.

10:58.840 --> 11:00.320
<i>They say people are unpredictable.</i>

11:01.000 --> 11:03.435
<i>But really, we all love routine.</i>

11:03.960 --> 11:05.440
- Morning, Nicky.
- Hey.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.792
<i>Me? I like seeing patterns.</i>

11:15.720 --> 11:17.439
<i>Patterns in everyday routines.</i>

11:17.600 --> 11:21.272
<i>Astrological experts have not
seen such intense activity...</i>

11:43.600 --> 11:44.716
Can I help you?!

11:52.760 --> 11:54.956
Hey, people, come on.
Let's clear these boards.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.440

- You didn't hold 'em?
- Yankee? Ah...

14:18.320 --> 14:19.356
Dude, what are you doing?

15:25.120 --> 15:26.634
GA 950...

15:58.320 --> 15:59.800
Your father was a pilot.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.480
Retired air force, yes.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.196
You graduated top of your class at NYU.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.193
Mm-hm. It was a great day for my dad.

16:11.880 --> 16:15.359
You got your pilot's license, so why
are you landing commercial jets

16:15.520 --> 16:16.920
and not flying them like he did?

16:17.120 --> 16:18.440
Because I'm not him.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.359
I only aced those tests
because they were based on

16:21.520 --> 16:24.274
a rotating series of algorithmic patterns.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.350
You see patterns?

16:29.560 --> 16:30.676
I guess.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.440
But just not today.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.596
You're suspended,
pending a full board review.

16:50.680 --> 16:51.830
How long?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.673
Four weeks and a board review.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.349
I'm sorry, Dyl.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.196
- It could have been worse.
- It should have been worse.

16:59.440 --> 17:01.113

Hey, maybe next time

- I'm Dylan.
- Did you like...

22:01.640 --> 22:03.074
Did you enjoy the aerial ballet?

22:03.240 --> 22:05.197
Yeah, I loved it.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.510
It was incredible.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.356
You seem surprised.

22:11.360 --> 22:12.794
It's my first time at the ballet.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.873
A friend kind of dared me to go.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.354
Would you like a drink?

22:19.640 --> 22:20.630
Uh...

22:20.800 --> 22:21.950
Or not.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.399
I'd prefer to get out of here...

22:28.280 --> 22:29.509
actually.

With me?

22:34.680 --> 22:35.796
Yeah.

22:35.960 --> 22:37.553
Oh, that's great!

I'm Sarah - in case
you wanted to know my name.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.712
Well, I kinda wanted to know.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.196
Come on.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.271
- So your first time?
- Yeah.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.074
Wasn't what I expected.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.720
No bulging tights.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.314
Oh, mercifully no.

22:58.820 --> 23:01.335
It was more... more epic.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.433
Or... um, intimate.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.080
Or... both.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.152
Yeah, or both. I don't know.

23:08.800 --> 23:12.357
You know, it kind of reminded me
of this feeling I'd get as a kid.

23:12.840 --> 23:14.752
I'd wait until everyone had gone to bed,

23:14.920 --> 23:17.389
and then I'd climb on to
the roof to look at the stars.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.712
Because my Dad was a pilot,

23:19.880 --> 23:22.839
so whenever I saw a flashing star,

23:23.040 --> 23:25.236
I'd pretend it was him flying across the sky

23:25.400 --> 23:27.357
and I knew he'd be looking down at me.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.318
And if I was really lucky, I'd see a shooting
star and I'd wish he'd come home.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.993
Oh. I love that.

23:36.560 --> 23:38.040
Did you ever want to do that?

23:39.320 --> 23:40.470
Yeah.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.116
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I did.

23:43.440 --> 23:46.035
Okay. Then why are you not a pilot?

23:47.880 --> 23:49.758
Because I'm afraid to fly.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.149
- Really?
- Didn't really work.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.673
- Wow.
- Scared to death.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.596
Right.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.235
Tell me something about you. What do you do?

24:01.480 --> 24:05.156
I... I work at the
Howard Pace Gallery downtown.

24:05.920 --> 24:07.195
Totally would have guessed that.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.879
- No! Really?
- Mm-hm.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.436
Well, it's funny. I never...

24:12.440 --> 24:15.558
I don't know, I never saw myself
working in an art gallery.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.072
Well, what did you want to be?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.514
A dancer.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.671
The other day at work, I made a mistake.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.029
I lost my flow.

24:36.600 --> 24:40.920
And, um... you know, there was...
there was one plane that was about to land,

24:41.120 --> 24:43.476
and another one about to take off.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.035
Something happened.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.672
I nearly killed 900 people.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.719
The plane that was coming in...

24:55.320 --> 24:56.470
what flight was it?

24:57.680 --> 24:59.637
AS841 from O'Hare.

25:03.760 --> 25:04.989
Are you okay?

25:07.440 --> 25:08.760
That was my flight.

25:09.760 --> 25:10.910
What?

25:12.800 --> 25:14.280
I was on that flight.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.955
Oh, I... I nearly killed you.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.836
No. You saved me.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.155
Sorry, guys. We're closing.

25:32.320 --> 25:33.595
Um... no.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.951
- Can we get one more drink?
- Yeah. Just...

25:36.720 --> 25:39.633
I know we only just met, but doesn't it...

25:39.800 --> 25:41.439
Feel like we've known each other forever?

25:43.400 --> 25:44.754
I was actually going to say

25:44.920 --> 25:48.800
it feels a little more intense
than your typical first date.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.512
I had a really good time tonight.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.314

Did you want to help me out, or...

26:26.960 --> 26:28.872
You know, you're not actually
creating the art.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.872
You're just doing the background.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.360
It's all about the background, Sarah.

26:32.520 --> 26:33.590
Okay.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.433
Major rendering meltdown.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.713

mad artist this morning?

26:41.080 --> 26:43.151

26:43.320 --> 26:45.073
Well, just make it incredible.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.560
Because art is that easy.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.757
Okay. Hey.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.155

26:50.640 --> 26:52.199

26:52.320 --> 26:53.310
Thank you.

26:53.480 --> 26:55.073
Don't worry about me, guys. I'm on a cleanse.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.959
How was it? The ballet?

26:58.120 --> 27:00.476
It was beautiful. It was, um...

27:01.680 --> 27:03.751
Yeah, it was... it was really nice.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.798
It wasn't anything religious, but...

27:06.760 --> 27:08.353
Bullshit - it was religious.

27:09.480 --> 27:10.516

And halfway through my senior year,

30:37.000 --> 30:40.471
I got offered an apprenticeship
at the New York City Ballet...

30:40.640 --> 30:42.711
- Mm-hm?
- ...which of course I took.

30:43.560 --> 30:46.280

30:47.400 --> 30:48.800

36:42.120 --> 36:43.520
Hey, man, why didn't you stop?

36:53.640 --> 36:54.960
Which way are you going?

36:55.120 --> 36:57.237
No worry. Is faster.

37:03.038 --> 37:04.011
Yeah.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.837
- No.
- Can I help you with that?

37:06.000 --> 37:08.640
Um... don't go this way, okay?

37:08.800 --> 37:10.234
We're heading towards Grand Central.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.312
- No, is good.
- No, no - let's not do this.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.994
Just stop the cab.

37:14.160 --> 37:15.355
What your problem?

37:16.720 --> 37:19.280
- Just stop the cab, okay?
- No yelling!

37:19.720 --> 37:21.996
Stop the cab and let me out, please!

37:24.440 --> 37:26.909
No yelling! I tell you no yelling at me!

37:52.440 --> 37:54.272
Okay. Help 'em out! Give me a hand!

37:56.240 --> 37:57.230
Okay, pull!

38:00.280 --> 38:02.112
Hey, buddy - you Okay?

38:02.280 --> 38:03.555
Hey, let me help you out.

38:20.920 --> 38:22.593
Hey, somebody call an ambulance!

38:26.160 --> 38:27.514
Ah!

39:04.360 --> 39:05.510
<i>Hey.</i>

39:06.640 --> 39:07.676
<i>Take this off.</i>

39:08.480 --> 39:10.312
<i>This is going to sound ridiculous, okay?</i>

39:10.480 --> 39:15.634
But I... I keep seeing the same people
for three days in a row, at Grand Central.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.797
A businessman reads a newspaper.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.680
<i>The Millhurst Express

39:21.840 --> 39:22.876
<i>A couple hugs.</i>

39:24.680 --> 39:25.716
I've missed you.

39:25.840 --> 39:26.830
<i>There's, uh...</i>

39:26.920 --> 39:29.799
<i>And these kids are crossing the concourse.</i>

39:30.600 --> 39:31.875
One drops something.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.320
<i>For three days in a row,</i>

39:35.480 --> 39:37.631
a pregnant woman under the clock.

39:37.800 --> 39:38.790
It's...

39:41.800 --> 39:44.110
<i>At exactly 2:22.</i>

39:46.600 --> 39:47.750
Boom.

39:57.240 --> 39:58.833
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

39:59.040 --> 40:02.033
<i>Your safety is our first priority.</i>

40:02.200 --> 40:03.714
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

40:07.960 --> 40:09.235
You're okay.

40:25.040 --> 40:26.360
Taxi?

40:26.920 --> 40:28.798
- Morning, Nicky.
- How you doin'?

41:02.760 --> 41:04.638
<i>Every little thing matters.</i>

41:06.920 --> 41:08.195
<i>A drop of water.</i>

41:09.480 --> 41:10.596
<i>A dead bug.</i>

41:13.960 --> 41:17.158
<i>A plane flies overhead at 11:15.</i>

41:20.520 --> 41:22.159
<i>It's all part of some kind of pattern.</i>

41:42.720 --> 41:44.951
- Can I help you with that?
- Thank you.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.114
Step back!

42:09.560 --> 42:13.474
GA 554, taxi, Papa, November, Alpha.

42:16.520 --> 42:17.954
<i>I think I'm losing it.</i>

42:18.880 --> 42:21.315
<i>They're shrinks.</i>
<i>They're paid to think you're losing it.</i>

42:21.720 --> 42:24.280
Yeah, things are happening to me, Inky.

42:25.040 --> 42:27.760
Things that cannot possibly be explained.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.075
What can I do?

42:32.720 --> 42:33.995
I don't know.

42:35.440 --> 42:36.794
Nothing.

42:39.320 --> 42:40.720
Call me, yeah?

42:41.240 --> 42:42.276
Yeah.

42:42.440 --> 42:44.113
We'll do something on your birthday.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.393
Only three days left, Dyl.

42:47.680 --> 42:49.080
Make the most of 'em.

43:19.960 --> 43:22.953
"9:10. Drip."

43:24.870 --> 43:27.636
Not today. Drip?

43:29.200 --> 43:30.298
Really?

43:31.920 --> 43:33.070
Drip!

43:37.600 --> 43:42.072
Five, four, three, two...

44:20.800 --> 44:21.790
What the fuck?

44:47.200 --> 44:50.439
<i>The Millhurst Express

44:53.880 --> 44:55.394
I've missed you.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.314
Hey, there you are.

45:24.440 --> 45:25.590
Yep.

45:25.760 --> 45:27.433
Alright, can I lead you over to...

45:27.600 --> 45:28.920
You can tell me what you think.

45:29.120 --> 45:30.110
Have you seen him?

45:30.280 --> 45:32.476
- No, okay.
- He is on the move. Yep.

45:32.640 --> 45:34.711
- Lovely to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

45:35.280 --> 45:39.073
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're all here to experience the work

45:39.240 --> 45:42.074
of one of our most exciting
contemporary artists -

45:42.440 --> 45:45.990
Mr. Jonas Edman, with his latest
tribute to this great city.

45:46.480 --> 45:50.076
Tonight I present you
the opening of... Convergence.

45:59.640 --> 46:00.835
Hi.

46:05.720 --> 46:06.995
Hi.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.160
Excuse me, ladies.

46:12.280 --> 46:13.396
Sarah.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.880
- Let's go.
- Hey.

46:15.080 --> 46:16.594
- We're good to go.
- Let's do it.

46:16.760 --> 46:18.479
Okay. Never again.

46:18.640 --> 46:20.074
- Showtime.
- Come on.

46:25.920 --> 46:27.957
Dylan, this is Jonas.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.036
Hi.

46:30.920 --> 46:31.910
Hi.

46:33.600 --> 46:34.716
Okay.

46:36.400 --> 46:37.470
Ready?

46:38.720 --> 46:42.350
Three, two, one... go.

46:52.680 --> 46:54.876
<i>Nothing is as eternal as a city.</i>

46:57.960 --> 47:01.874
<i>And you are my eternal love,</i>
<i>the city of all cities.</i>

47:03.000 --> 47:06.516
<i>Pavemented, walled, lit, jeweled.</i>

47:08.480 --> 47:09.994
<i>Crowded city of beauty.</i>

47:11.440 --> 47:14.080
<i>Of shadows and geometric shapes never ending.</i>

48:01.440 --> 48:05.275
<i>Your windows reflect memories</i>
<i>none of us can keep.</i>

48:06.640 --> 48:08.472
<i>Moments, they slip away,</i>

48:09.520 --> 48:11.716
<i>a whisper in our sleep.</i>

48:21.280 --> 48:24.633
<i>The Millhurst Express
is now boarding on track 32.</i>

48:38.560 --> 48:41.473
<i>Your arms hold the sky, reflecting in truth.</i>

48:45.040 --> 48:47.077
<i>Where God and men meet</i>

48:48.360 --> 48:50.352
<i>in our reverence to you.</i>

49:03.640 --> 49:05.154
Is this some kind of sick joke?

49:05.600 --> 49:06.716
What?

49:09.000 --> 49:10.992
What are you doing?
Have you been following me?

49:12.040 --> 49:13.918
- What is this?
- Whoa, attention, bro.

49:14.080 --> 49:15.753
How long have you been doing this?

49:15.880 --> 49:17.473
- What is going on here, man?
- What are you doing?

49:17.560 --> 49:19.074
- Dylan!
- Have you been following me?

49:19.240 --> 49:21.197
What is this? What are you doing?

49:21.860 --> 49:22.999
Jonas!

49:23.160 --> 49:25.356
- Why would you do this?
- Get off me!

49:25.880 --> 49:28.270
Hey, hey, hey! Let him go!

49:29.480 --> 49:31.870
Let go of me! Get off of me!

49:32.920 --> 49:34.149
What are you doing?

49:40.000 --> 49:41.070
Stop.

49:47.160 --> 49:50.039
Bravo. Bravo.

49:52.280 --> 49:53.839
I love this, Jonas.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.072
A nice morbid tale to button the exhibit.

49:57.320 --> 50:00.350
I have another amazing interpretation
in my gallery, you know.

50:00.520 --> 50:01.590
What?

50:01.760 --> 50:05.117
I love how you blended
the victims in so elegantly

50:05.280 --> 50:07.158
a moment before the murders.

50:07.560 --> 50:08.994
It's really stunning.

50:09.160 --> 50:10.389
What is he talking about?

50:10.560 --> 50:12.392
I have no idea.

50:12.560 --> 50:15.314
The photograph... of the murder scene.

50:18.160 --> 50:19.514
Come on, time to leave.

50:25.800 --> 50:27.234
What is wrong with you?

50:27.400 --> 50:28.516
What is that?

50:29.400 --> 50:32.516
You know Jonas is the most
important artist in this exhibit.

50:32.680 --> 50:33.875
Yes, and he's your ex-boyfriend.

50:34.040 --> 50:35.269
How... How's this possible?

50:35.440 --> 50:39.029
That hologram is the exact replica
of what I've been seeing.

50:39.200 --> 50:40.236
This is crazy.

50:40.400 --> 50:41.595
How is this possible?

50:42.400 --> 50:43.550
How does he know?

50:44.320 --> 50:47.040
You know, I can't actually have
this conversation right now.

50:49.360 --> 50:50.589
Let yourself out.

50:52.240 --> 50:53.879
- Sarah.
- Sarah.

50:55.160 --> 50:56.992
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.799
I don't know what happened.

52:06.040 --> 52:07.599
<i>Dylan, this is Jonas.</i>

52:20.520 --> 52:23.080
<i>The energetic force of the exploding Hamlin</i>

52:23.280 --> 52:25.556
<i>will be at its greatest in the next two days.</i>

52:25.960 --> 52:27.440
<i>This is a very rare event...</i>

52:28.760 --> 52:31.958
<i>...the massive lifespan of the average star.</i>

53:48.960 --> 53:50.474
"Jake Redmond."

54:02.560 --> 54:03.914
Letters to this address.

54:11.400 --> 54:12.754
"My Dear Jake,

54:12.920 --> 54:14.115
I just got your letter

54:14.280 --> 54:16.351
and I can't stop grinning from ear to ear."

54:20.720 --> 54:23.110
<i>Um, Sarah, it's Dylan. Um...</i>

54:23.720 --> 54:26.030
<i>I'm so sorry about last night. I...</i>

54:26.240 --> 54:29.039
<i>This thing with Jonas and the</i>
<i>hologram just really got to me.</i>

54:30.160 --> 54:31.560
<i>Please call me, okay?</i>

55:37.680 --> 55:40.639
<i>The next stop is Grand Central.</i>

55:42.240 --> 55:43.959
<i>Grand Central.</i>

55:56.760 --> 55:58.558
Thought you might drop by.

56:02.600 --> 56:04.956
So there's the killer with
the gun in his hand.

56:05.680 --> 56:08.832
He shot a woman and a police
detective in broad daylight

56:09.000 --> 56:11.435
before he was gunned down by the cops.

56:12.120 --> 56:15.238
A tourist from Cleveland took
the original photograph...

56:18.120 --> 56:20.589
and the artist has taken that image and...

56:21.480 --> 56:22.834
created this piece.

56:31.080 --> 56:32.355
Stay as long as you like.

56:38.200 --> 56:40.317
"Multiple homicides at Grand Central.

56:41.760 --> 56:44.594
"...criminal Jake Redmond."

57:09.560 --> 57:11.358
No, not it.

57:19.160 --> 57:20.310
Here it is.

57:52.400 --> 57:55.832
<i>The Millhurst Express
is now boarding on track 32.</i>

58:10.000 --> 58:11.354
<i>"Jake Redmond.</i>

58:11.840 --> 58:14.560
<i>Born April 18th 1956."</i>

58:40.960 --> 58:42.110
<i>Who is it?</i>

58:42.480 --> 58:43.755
It's Dylan Branson.

58:44.120 --> 58:45.520
We spoke over the phone.

58:46.040 --> 58:47.269
<i>I'll buzz you in.</i>

59:07.800 --> 59:09.075
Where did you get these?

59:09.520 --> 59:10.749
In my apartment.

59:10.840 --> 59:11.910
They were hidden.

59:12.440 --> 59:13.954
And why did you come here?

59:15.960 --> 59:17.280
<i>I don't know.</i>

59:20.120 --> 59:21.600
<i>I feel a connection to her.</i>

59:22.840 --> 59:24.559
<i>You want to talk about connection?</i>

59:25.360 --> 59:26.999
She was my sister.

59:27.600 --> 59:29.159
She was the kindest person.

59:30.040 --> 59:31.838
She had a voice like an angel

59:32.040 --> 59:34.919
<i>and she sang at clubs all around town</i>

59:35.080 --> 59:36.912
<i>and that's where she met Jake.</i>

59:37.280 --> 59:38.794
<i>She thought he was...</i>

59:39.200 --> 59:41.112
<i>funny and clever and sweet.</i>

59:42.240 --> 59:44.357
<i>Newspapers said he was a convicted criminal.</i>

59:44.680 --> 59:46.080
<i>He was never convicted.</i>

59:46.480 --> 59:48.790
<i>The police had to say that to save face.</i>

59:48.960 --> 59:50.519
<i>I still don't know what he was up to.</i>

59:50.600 --> 59:51.750
<i>It was some kind of...</i>

59:51.840 --> 59:55.400
<i>insurance scams or racketeering,
something like that.</i>

59:55.560 --> 59:56.835
<i>And everyone tried to warn her...</i>

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.760
<i>the police, her friends and that
poor detective who died with her.</i>

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.712
- <i>Noah Marks.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.157
<i>I think he was in love with her, too.</i>

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.711
<i>She had that effect on men.</i>
<i>She couldn't see it.</i>

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.230
She believed that Jake
was the love of her life.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.756
Did Jake love her the same way back?

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.998
Well, apparently enough to kill
her rather than let her go.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.077
Is that what she was doing at Grand Central?

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.035
Was she leaving him?

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:32.479
Detective Marks came to see Evie one night.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.435
<i>He told her things about Jake</i>
<i>that she never knew.</i>

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.516
<i>He was a violent man.</i>

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.913
<i>He'd killed a police informer.</i>

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.193
<i>She kept saying, "I don't believe it.</i>

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.392
<i>Jake would never hurt anyone."</i>

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.877
She said they were destined to be together.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.714
Even had the same birthday.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.753
He said Jake was a psycho,

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.760
that he was dangerous.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.232
And Detective Marks said that...

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.474
he had a place,

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.637
somewhere up in, uh...

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.750
Millhurst.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.159
<i>The Millhurst Express

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.710
Yeah. Millhurst.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.271
This is what we found after she...

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.150
Take them.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.791
I... I could never bear to read them.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.071
This is all I need to remember her by.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:04.473
<i>The Millhurst Express
is now boarding on track 32.</i>

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.154
<i>Hey, Sarah,</i>

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.152
<i>I really need to talk to you.</i>

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:18.600
<i>These patterns, the things</i>
<i>I'm seeing, the hologram...</i>

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.273
<i>us, everything - it's all connected.</i>

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.079
<i>Please, call me.</i>

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.074
For over a week now,

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.436
he's ended up right here at Grand Central.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.074
What made you do this?

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.313
It's Grand Central.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.516
It's iconic New York.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.958
<i>I've been working on</i>
<i>this thing for eight months,</i>

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.560
<i>way before you met your... boyfriend.</i>

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.593
<i>The Millhurst Express
is now boarding on track 32.</i>

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.797
<i>Yeah, but the same people.</i>

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:38.758
<i>I mean, the... the businessman,
the couple hugging...</i>

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.440
Hey, I've missed you.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.159
<i>...the school children...</i>

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.394
...the pregnant woman.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.549
He... he sees them. He sees...

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.314
the same people. He described all of them.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.400
The same people?

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:05.599
<i>The Millhurst Express
is now boarding on track 32.</i>

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:12.357
<i>Well, not the exact same people but the...</i>

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.431
<i>I don't know, the same type of people.</i>

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.229
He... he thinks it's a pattern.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.316
Seriously?

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.031
A businessman in a train
station is a pattern?

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.155
I don't know.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:33.433
You know what they call people
who see patterns in everything?

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.799
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.594
Yeah, um...

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.640
the Millhurst Express.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.713
Bit of news for you.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.200
The Millhurst Express...

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.835
ain't run for nearly three decades now.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.629
What?

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.159
<i>The Poughkeepsie Express
is now boarding on track 32.</i>

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.958
Look out!

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.079
<i>Your attention please.</i>

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.711
<i>Your safety is our first priority.</i>

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.794
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.099
Thanks for coming.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.711
I... I'm...

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.113
I'm so sorry, Sarah.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.349
I'm so sorry.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.835
Hey. Hey.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.035
Are you okay?

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.393
What's really going on?

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.432
I... I know what this looks like.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.280
I get it.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.673
How long have you been doing this?

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.075
Just a couple of days.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.070
Well... since the day at JFK, really.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.237
It was like I saw the sky cracking open.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.274
I saw right through it.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.753
Now look at this.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:07.400
His name's Jake Redmond, right?

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.559
He was a killer. He was...

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.196
- I see.
- And this is Evelyn Mills.

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.710
She was a singer.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:18.037
And they died at Grand Central 30 years ago
tomorrow, the day you and I were born.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.795
We're them.

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:24.913
- No.
- Look at this. Look at this.

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.439
Look. Look.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.554
I wrote these letters to you.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:34.390
And you...

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.310
wrote these to me.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.835
A lifetime ago.

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:39.834
Look. Look at this.

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:41.760
Look at them.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.399
It's all happening again.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.640
- No, I...
- I know. I don't understand.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.837
- I...
- I don't... I don't...

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.595
I don't... I don't want to know
what is in them.

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.073
Your patterns...

01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:57.680
these letters...

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.511
they don't mean anything.

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:03.593
They mean everything.
You've gotta understand...

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.194
No, you need to understand.

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:07.517
It is Grand Central.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:10.555
I could go there any time
of day and find these people

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.279
if that's what I was looking for.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.840
All these patterns

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.198
that you think exist...

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.072
they're just people.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.511
No.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:25.831
You live in a city of 8 million.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.635
Of course they're going to be
doing similar things.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.635
You hear that?

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:36.634
Dog barking.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.031
Telephone ringing.

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:42.111
Airplane. Baby crying.

01:09:42.319 --> 01:09:43.837
Car horn.

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.189
Car horn.

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.474
It is New York City and it is all happening.

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:52.200
It is all happening, all of the time.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.193
Please don't do this.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.320
Please.

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:04.200
When I'm with you
I feel something so special.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.313
Just stop it.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.115
Don't you get it?

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:12.152
She dies. He kills her.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.273
This is us.

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:18.320
We die tomorrow, Sarah.

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.591
We need to end this now for your own good.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:21.955
No.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.359
We can not see each other again.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.557
- Don't do this to us.
- Go!

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.036
Please go.

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.240
<i>Can I help you?</i>

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.193
<i>The Millhurst Express

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.794
<i>I've missed you.</i>

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.480
<i>Can I help you with that?</i>

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.196
Yeah?

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.834
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.557
I need to know why Grand Central.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:27.233
You both have this connection.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.350
It's a coincidence.

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:30.840
He doesn't believe in that.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.354
Or therapy, apparently.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.834
Sarah, this has to stop.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.873
You can't keep doing this to us.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.360
To yourself. It's...

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:41.995
It's destructive.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.758
I'm going to take you away for a few days.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.192
You saw the way he looked at me.

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.354
He wanted to kill me.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:03.038
He is out of control, Sarah.

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.354
You're not safe here.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.554
I mean it.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.920
I love him.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.680
I love him so much.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:21.719
I don't know what it is,
we just have this connection.

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.359
Constellations.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.239
A map of the heavens.

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:06.718
<i>...electromagnetic shifts
in the Earth's atmosphere.</i>

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.072
<i>Einstein's theory of relativity...</i>

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:27.160
Happy birthday.

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:37.031
<i>Scientists believe the electromagnetic
field around the Earth</i>

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:41.478
<i>is being affected by the supernova
from the dying star, Hamil.</i>

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.712
<i>So more and more we're able to confirm</i>

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.715
<i>just how alive and effectible</i>
<i>our world truly is.</i>

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.675
<i>Even an exploding star 30 light years away</i>

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:54.753
<i>causes our planet to adjust and react</i>

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:56.718
<i>as its light actually reaches us.</i>

01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:58.958
<i>Science is starting to...</i>

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.115
<i>What am I missing?</i>

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:46.555
<i>What appears to be a star dying to us now</i>

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.037
<i>actually happened 30 years ago.</i>

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.871
<i>So when we look into the distant night sky</i>

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:54.716
<i>we are not just seeing</i>
<i>the reaches of the universe,</i>

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:58.917
<i>we are quite literally</i>
<i>looking back in time itself.</i>

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.435
<i>Back in time.</i>

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.440

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.196
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.150
You good?

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:05.750
Yeah.

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.480
JFK, please.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.476
<i>A woman laughs.</i>

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.876
Can I help you with that?

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.076
Can I help you with that?

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.429
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.478
Bell.

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:28.755
Follow the bell.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.812
<i>Door slams.</i>

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:35.836
Hey.

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:38.716
A couple of days in Millhurst
will do you wonders.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.040
Sarah.

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.115
No.

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.320
Jonas.

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.359
You're Noah Marks.

01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.840
Just don't answer it.

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.678
Sarah, where are you? Just pick up the phone.

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:09.469
Shit.

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:10.636
What?

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.553
Our flight's been cancelled.

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:16.197
Change of plan. We're going to Grand Central.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.590
<i>Siren.</i>

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.796

Alright, swinging it back.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.195
Gonna get the tickets.

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.550
Meet you at the clock.

Sir!

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.193

<i>I know what the patterns are.</i>

Two tickets to Millhurst please.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.750
What?

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:31.389
Millhurst.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.040
30 years ago maybe.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.434
Poughkeepsie will get you there.

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:37.955
That'll be $52.

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:39.835
Poughkeepsie.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:42.673
Hands behind your back, sir.

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:43.910
Okay.

Sir, just stop right there.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.680

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:53.560
- People are gonna die, man!
- Nobody's gonna die, sir.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:55.234

Okay, okay.

01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:04.073
That's it. Lower it to the ground.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.196
- I'm warning you.
- Alright.

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.397
- Put the weapon down.
- Letting it go.

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:15.756
<i>Three.</i>

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:18.270
<i>Two.</i>

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.475
<i>One.</i>

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:46.036
Heads down! Get out of the way!

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:52.916
There we go.

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.509
Two tickets to Poughkeepsie.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.757
I thought you said
we were going to Millhurst.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.040
What are you talking about?

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.429
You ready?

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:07.596
I'm sorry.

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:09.752
Hey, hey, hey. Wait, what's wrong?

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:11.240
- Take your hands off me.
- What?

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.479
Stay away from me.

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:21.396
Stop!

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.280
You love me, Evelyn.

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:32.117
You just called me Evelyn.

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.680
But you love me.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.160
I don't.

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:46.637
- Say it.
- No.

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.360
Say it!

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.191
- Tell me you love me!
- No.

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.595
Sarah!

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:07.680
You brought him here?

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.394
You brought him here?

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.354
A businessman.

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:27.955
A businessman.

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.193
<i>The Millhurst Express
is now boarding on track 32.</i>

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:34.594
A couple hugs.

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.558
A couple hugs.

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:38.200
I missed you.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:43.350
There's always a row of schoolchildren.

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.152
And a pregnant woman...

01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:58.433
standing under the clock.

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.673
Get out of here!

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:20.160
She'll never be yours.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.350
No!

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:56.990
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.040
No!

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:11.840
Put the weapon down!

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.071
Freeze! Drop your weapon now!

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:54.316
Boom.

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.634
No!

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.434
No! No!

01:29:23.290 --> 01:29:24.644
No.

<i>A star shines brightest right before it dies.</i>

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:33.190
God.

<i>The sun's coming out for us.</i>

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.990
- I want more of you.
- You want more of me?

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:57.120
<i>All these years, history
said Jake was a murderer,</i>

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:01.716
<i>when in fact he was framed by</i>
<i>the cops to protect their own.</i>

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.630
<i>And in the end, only</i>
<i>love could reveal the truth.</i>

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:09.876
<i>"My dear Jake,</i>

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:11.635
<i>I just got your letter</i>

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:14.554
<i>and I can't stop smiling from ear to ear.</i>

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.592
<i>I don't understand why I'm feeling...</i>

<i>...the way I am so quickly.</i>

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:23.073
<i>I just never believed</i>
<i>a love like this was possible."</i>

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:37.989
Hi.

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:51.313
It's 2:23.

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:55.200
We made it.

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:30.920
<i>So as expected,</i>

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:34.712
<i>the dying star Hamlin did finally disappear.</i>

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:40.830
<i>But somewhere, somehow
another star was born right after.</i>

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.835
<i>Dad's predictions all those</i>
<i>years ago did finally play out.</i>

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:56.109
<i>He was right when he said in
everyone's life there comes a time</i>

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.630
<i>or, in my case, many times...</i>

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:03.316
<i>when the universe opens</i>
<i>itself for just a few moments</i>

01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:05.870
<i>to show us what's truly possible.</i>

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:56.469
11:15.

01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:58.870
No plane.
