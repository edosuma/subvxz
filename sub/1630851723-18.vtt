WEBVTT

00:02.936 --> 00:04.105
Come on, Raymond.

00:04.238 --> 00:05.706
You really think
Kate Kaplan is alive?

00:05.839 --> 00:07.175
I don't know, Marvin.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.677
I never had divers
recover her body.

00:09.810 --> 00:12.413
She chose the Potomac
as her final resting place,

00:12.546 --> 00:13.847
and I chose
to respect her wishes.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.185
I loved you, Raymond.

00:17.318 --> 00:18.619
Kate!

00:27.628 --> 00:29.397
So it's possible
she survived.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.532
And what?
Surfaced downriver

00:31.665 --> 00:33.234
and somehow got help

00:33.367 --> 00:34.368
without us knowing

00:34.502 --> 00:35.769
and waited years

00:35.903 --> 00:39.173
for just the right moment
to exact her revenge?

00:39.307 --> 00:40.641
I'll tell you this, Marvin...

00:40.774 --> 00:42.143
Kate loved Elizabeth.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.777
She helped to raise her.

00:43.911 --> 00:45.313
There is not a chance

00:45.446 --> 00:48.015
she sent Vandyke to kill her.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.284
So maybe she sent him
to kill you.

00:50.418 --> 00:53.321
Maybe. She didn't know
about Townsend's wish

00:53.454 --> 00:55.389
for me to watch
Elizabeth die.

00:55.523 --> 00:56.724
So she couldn't have known

00:56.857 --> 00:57.858
Vandyke would kill

00:57.991 --> 00:59.460
Elizabeth first.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.061
If it's Kate,
we'll find her.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.496
She's good,
but we're better.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.665
I'm not in D.C. I'm...

01:04.798 --> 01:06.667
God knows where I am.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.002
Weecha and I are on our way
to West Virginia.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.371
Maureen Rowan lives there.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.072
Kate's sister?

01:12.206 --> 01:13.507
I thought she was
in witness protection.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.876
She is.
Living under an alias

01:16.009 --> 01:18.446
in a little town
called Silver Glade.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.614
If Kate's been alive
all these years,

01:20.748 --> 01:22.883
it's possible
Maureen would know.

01:23.016 --> 01:23.884
Raymond.

01:24.017 --> 01:25.018
Maureen.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.187
I should've called.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.055
You should have.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.623
But I wouldn't
have answered,

01:29.757 --> 01:31.225
mostly because
I don't have a phone.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.794
What a lovely place.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.463
You've done
all this yourself?

01:35.596 --> 01:37.765
I'm designing my own
retirement plan.

01:37.898 --> 01:40.934
One day, I'm gonna
build a gazebo out here
and just sit.

01:41.068 --> 01:43.003
Why wait?
You should do it now.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.072
Mm, right now,
it's a little out
of my price range.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.275
Someday.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.477
Oh, it's been
a while, Raymond.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.878
Last time
we saw each other

01:51.011 --> 01:52.913
was the day you came
to tell me my sister
had passed.

01:53.046 --> 01:55.149
Yes.

01:55.283 --> 01:59.220
I wish I could have told you
more about the circumstances.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.654
I don't.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.090
Kate and I never spoke
about her work.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.725
But I always thought
it was kind of you

02:04.858 --> 02:06.460
to let me know
she was gone.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.962
That's why
I've come, actually.
I can't be certain,

02:09.096 --> 02:12.633
but it's possible
my condolences
were premature.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.971
I never asked
about how Kate died.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.441
I assumed
you made arrangements
for her remains.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.945
No. Her body
was never recovered.

02:26.414 --> 02:27.481
I see.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.751
And this associate
of yours,

02:30.884 --> 02:33.721
the one who
claims he saw her,
you believe him?

02:33.854 --> 02:36.524
I believe
he thinks he saw her.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.592
But that may be
what someone
wanted him to think.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.497
You do remind me of her.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.166
Of better times.

02:47.835 --> 02:51.772
If Kate is alive, she's been
in hiding for a while,

02:51.905 --> 02:54.275
and it's likely
that she's in some trouble.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.944
If you've had
any contact...

02:57.077 --> 02:59.146
I don't understand.
If she's in trouble,

02:59.280 --> 03:01.515
wouldn't you
be the first person
she'd reach out to?

03:01.649 --> 03:03.016
So you haven't
heard from her?

03:03.150 --> 03:04.318
That's no surprise.

03:04.452 --> 03:05.686
Kate and I were close,
in our way,

03:05.819 --> 03:07.688
but she would never
come to me for help.

03:11.359 --> 03:12.926
What about the woman,
you know,

03:13.060 --> 03:14.362
the one Kate was seeing

03:14.495 --> 03:16.630
around the time
she supposedly died?

03:16.764 --> 03:18.266
Kate was seeing someone?

03:18.399 --> 03:21.635
Well, I only know this
because you weren't
the only visitor then.

03:21.769 --> 03:25.639
A woman came to meet me
and to pay her respects.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.040
Clara.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.609
Clara Moore was her name.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.177
She worked with Kate.

03:30.311 --> 03:33.781
Said Kate had taught her
everything, like a mentor.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.183
It was clear they'd been
in a relationship

03:36.317 --> 03:38.919
and she loved
my sister very much.

03:39.052 --> 03:42.022
If you could find her,
she might know something.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.857
Clara Moore.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.328
That's very helpful.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.973
I've been waiting
for this day
for a long time.

04:00.107 --> 04:05.346
Psilocybin, ketamine,
LSD, MDMA.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.047
For the first time,

04:07.180 --> 04:08.582
mainstream
medical institutions

04:08.716 --> 04:10.050
are taking a long, hard look

04:10.183 --> 04:13.086
at the healthcare benefits
of psychedelics.

04:13.220 --> 04:16.824
Major universities in this
country and around the world

04:16.957 --> 04:20.027
are studying these drugs
and how they can
help patients.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.098
You can just leave it.
Thanks.

04:25.232 --> 04:26.734
No can do.
I need a signature.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.740
This is our moment.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.942
As we speak,
venture capitalists

04:35.075 --> 04:37.878
are spending billions
of legitimate dollars...

04:40.247 --> 04:43.884
...on companies that make
and sell mind-altering drugs.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.420
I want our share.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.889
Hell, I want
more than our share.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.727
Stay.

04:57.765 --> 05:00.934
We are the future
of healthcare!

05:01.068 --> 05:02.636
One day, you're gonna
look back on this day,

05:02.770 --> 05:03.737
and you're gonna tell your

05:03.871 --> 05:05.105
grandchildren you were there.

05:18.786 --> 05:19.787
I warned you.

05:24.792 --> 05:25.893
Did you really think

05:26.026 --> 05:27.060
I would let you set up shop

05:27.194 --> 05:28.929
in my city?

05:29.062 --> 05:31.064
Oroszlan,
there's no time.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.344
Always glad
to see you, Raymond.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.979
But I have to admit,

05:46.113 --> 05:49.149
I was hoping you'd give
this next new case to Aram.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.151
He's in charge
of the task force now.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.587
Have you thought
any more about giving him
another chance?

05:53.721 --> 05:55.355
I have,
and I'm sorry, Harold.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.357
I just don't trust him.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.659
He's simply...

06:00.027 --> 06:01.762
Wound too tight.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.297
Maybe. When I left
the office last night,

06:04.432 --> 06:06.700
he was agonizing over
this year's annual review.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.135
He has to
fill out a report

06:08.268 --> 06:10.738
on all the agents
under his command.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.506
I must say, it's got him
pretty stressed out.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.174
Mm.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.209
I wonder if he'd
consider therapy,

06:16.343 --> 06:21.214
specifically guided therapy
aided by psychedelics.

06:21.348 --> 06:25.819
Properly applied, I find LSD
to be helpful in dark times

06:25.953 --> 06:27.688
and a blast in good times.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.857
Nothing loosens
a tight sphincter

06:29.990 --> 06:31.492
like a good
eight-hour acid trip.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.193
LSD is illegal.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.195
Well, it doesn't
have to be LSD.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.397
Ketamine, psilocybin.

06:37.531 --> 06:40.668
The point is, there's new
interest in these drugs.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.035
It's been almost 60 years

06:42.169 --> 06:43.904
since Harvard University

06:44.037 --> 06:46.373
fired Timothy Leary.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.042
Now even Harvard's studying
the health benefits

06:49.176 --> 06:51.344
of the drugs
he so famously touted.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.080
That's good news.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.749
It is, for everyone
except the criminals
who still make a living

06:55.883 --> 06:57.217
selling these drugs,

06:57.350 --> 06:59.987
criminals like
Laszlo Jankowics.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.355
Jankowics.
Why do I know that name?

07:02.490 --> 07:05.225
Because his father, Marko,
was once on the Blacklist.

07:05.358 --> 07:08.562
He used to be
one the world's biggest
LSD distributors.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.063
Until Agent Ressler
killed him.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.100
Yes. But as dangerous
as Marko was,

07:13.233 --> 07:17.571
I'm afraid his son, Laszlo,
is even more unhinged.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.372
This morning?
Six homicides?

07:19.507 --> 07:21.074
Reddington thinks
that this Laszlo

07:21.208 --> 07:22.910
just gunned them down
in their chairs?

07:23.043 --> 07:25.846
It's nine, actually, including
the guards and receptionist.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.248
This happened just
because he didn't want
a legitimate company

07:28.381 --> 07:29.650
trying to make
these drugs legally?

07:29.783 --> 07:31.284
Could that really
be the only motive?

07:31.418 --> 07:33.687
Who in their right mind
would kill nine people
for that?

07:33.821 --> 07:36.590
Well, that's the thing.
Apparently, he's not
in his right mind.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.826
Laszlo's known for being
addicted to his own product,

07:38.959 --> 07:41.194
a liquid form of LSD.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.497
And when abused, LSD can do
some pretty serious damage

07:43.631 --> 07:45.098
to the brain.
In some cases,

07:45.232 --> 07:47.267
your hallucinations
can become permanent.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.869
Reddington says
they call him Oroszlan.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.038
That's the Hungarian word
for lion.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.840
Because he thinks
he's the king of the jungle?

07:52.973 --> 07:54.441
No, because he thinks

07:54.575 --> 07:56.409
a fully grown African lion
goes wherever he goes.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.479
Oroszlan, we're running
low on product.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.814
We need to make
new arrangements.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.816
I already have.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.652
The Phan organization
has sent a shipment.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.086
It's arriving
at the port today.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.255
Today? Oroszlan,
the port is not safe.

08:08.388 --> 08:09.590
Why would you take
such an unnecessary risk?

08:09.723 --> 08:10.991
But it is necessary.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.928
We need product
to stay in business.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.669
So,
this Laszlo Jankowics

08:21.802 --> 08:23.036
is the next name
on the Blacklist?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.272
Correct. That's who
Reddington wants us to find.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.241
Why? We're looking for
whoever orchestrated
Elizabeth's death,

08:28.375 --> 08:29.777
the same person
who's been blackmailing you.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.679
What's the connection
to this Oroszlan?

08:31.812 --> 08:33.714
I don't know. Reddington
just said it was important.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.515
To us or to him?

08:37.250 --> 08:39.186
Agent Ressler.
Look, I, um...

08:39.319 --> 08:41.488
I know it's weird
that I'm, like,
the boss or whatever,

08:41.622 --> 08:43.523
but, uh, please
just let me know
if you're gonna be late.

08:43.657 --> 08:44.858
That was my fault.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.193
You all know
Agent Ressler and I

08:46.326 --> 08:48.328
have been investigating
Reggie Cole and Tyson Lacroix.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.363
I asked Agent Ressler
to apply for a warrant

08:50.497 --> 08:52.432
to search
Lacroix's home office.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.702
And that request was approved
by Judge Perez 20 minutes ago.

08:54.835 --> 08:57.070
Good news. Aram,
if it's okay with you,

08:57.204 --> 08:59.306
Agent Ressler and I
would like to execute
the search warrant.

08:59.439 --> 09:01.975
Oh, yeah. I mean,
yes, that is perfect.

09:02.109 --> 09:05.779
Agent Park, Agent Zuma,
we have an active crime scene
at Virtual Horizons Lab.

09:05.913 --> 09:06.980
Why don't you two
head on over there?

09:08.481 --> 09:09.482
Good. Yeah.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.986
Don't worry about me.
I'm just gonna be

09:13.120 --> 09:14.722
filling out a thousand
pages of paperwork,

09:14.855 --> 09:15.889
judging you all
for the Bureau.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.966
Mr. Avery, thank you
for speaking with me.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.502
I know how difficult this...
I have to tell the families.

09:29.637 --> 09:30.904
These people, my staff,

09:31.038 --> 09:33.073
they had wives,
husbands, children.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.908
The Bureau
can help with that.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.043
Right now,
I would like to focus

09:36.176 --> 09:38.345
on the company meeting
you had this morning.

09:38.478 --> 09:41.114
We just started.
Today was our first day

09:41.248 --> 09:42.716
in our brand-new lab.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.184
You're a chemist.
Is that right?

09:44.317 --> 09:46.186
I have a degree
in neurochemistry, yes,

09:46.319 --> 09:49.189
but I consider myself
a medical futurist.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.525
My work is about advancing
healthcare, improving lives.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.194
By manufacturing
psychedelic drugs?

09:54.327 --> 09:56.129
By studying them.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.732
And, yes, maybe one day
selling them.

09:58.866 --> 10:01.101
The problem is, some people
already sell them,

10:01.234 --> 10:02.736
and they don't want
any competition.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.237
Is that why this happened?

10:04.371 --> 10:06.439
The Bureau is aware
of a criminal organization

10:06.573 --> 10:08.441
that sells
illegal psychedelics.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.377
We think they were
sending you a message.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.880
By murdering
my entire staff?

10:13.013 --> 10:14.414
How many gunmen
were there?

10:15.883 --> 10:17.951
I...don't know.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.122
Mr. Avery, you were
the only survivor.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.891
I'm sure you're scared,

10:24.024 --> 10:25.192
but if there's anything
you saw, anyone...

10:25.325 --> 10:26.293
No, I wish I had.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.396
When I heard the shots,
I immediately ran.

10:29.529 --> 10:33.100
I was hiding in that room,
so I never saw their faces.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.235
Agent Zuma.
Sorry to interrupt.
You should see this.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.070
Excuse me.

10:40.573 --> 10:41.875
Caught a break.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.576
You're looking at
acrylic plexiglass.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.445
It's over
3.5 inches thick.

10:45.578 --> 10:48.281
It's installed to
weather an accidental
chemical explosion.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.784
But today, it functioned
as bulletproof glass.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.185
The slug
never fragmented.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.286
Great.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.288
Let's pull it and run it
for ballistics

10:55.422 --> 10:56.790
and latent prints.

10:59.592 --> 11:02.395
I don't understand.
Why is any
of this necessary?

11:02.529 --> 11:03.831
Mrs. Lacroix,
you've seen the warrant.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.432
Please stand aside.
Let us do our jobs.

11:05.565 --> 11:08.301
Your jobs?
My husband was murdered.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.437
It's your job to find
and arrest his killer.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.072
That's exactly what
we're trying to do.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.041
By seizing
my husband's files?

11:14.174 --> 11:16.376
He's the victim. You're acting
like he was a criminal.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.178
I'm sorry,
but we're here
because Tyson,

11:18.311 --> 11:19.612
whether he knew it
or not,

11:19.747 --> 11:21.849
was connected
to a criminal conspiracy.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.316
Conspir... What kind of...

11:23.450 --> 11:24.718
I can't discuss
our evidence.

11:24.852 --> 11:25.986
With one exception.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.256
This man,
you ever seen him before?

11:29.389 --> 11:30.858
His name was
Reginald Cole.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.525
I don't know who that is.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.427
But I knew my husband,
and you're wrong.

11:34.561 --> 11:37.130
He was a good man
and an honest lawyer.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.231
We're almost done.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.399
We'll be out of here
within the hour.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.770
Check this out.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.072
Lacroix and Cole weren't
just lawyer and client,

11:45.205 --> 11:46.473
they were
working together.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.876
Makes sense.
It's not unusual
for a civil attorney

11:49.009 --> 11:50.477
to have a private eye
on the payroll.

11:50.610 --> 11:53.046
What is unusual
is what Cole
was hired to do.

11:53.180 --> 11:56.149
He was keeping
around-the-clock surveillance
on Stanford March.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.517
The tech executive?

11:57.650 --> 11:58.886
Sent Lacroix
a full dossier.

11:59.019 --> 12:02.422
Photos, itinerary,
a detailed list
of his known assets.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.757
What are you thinking?

12:03.891 --> 12:05.692
I'm thinking
where's the case?

12:05.826 --> 12:08.295
Lacroix never filed
an actual suit
against March.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.897
Maybe he was planning to
but didn't get the chance.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.499
Maybe, or maybe that was
never part of the plan.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.534
Cole was blackmailing you.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.870
What if he and Lacroix
were doing the same thing
to others?

12:17.004 --> 12:18.839
Let's go see if Mr. March
can enlighten us.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.879
Good news.
We got a latent print

12:26.013 --> 12:28.348
off a slug recovered
at Virtual Horizons Lab.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.884
Print comes back
to a three-time felon
named Sebastian Graham.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.086
What's a three-time felon
doing out where he can
kill people?

12:33.220 --> 12:34.687
He's on parole
for a weapons charge.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.756
Felon in possession
of a firearm.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.158
We talked to
his parole officer,

12:38.291 --> 12:39.559
and she's calling him in
for a meeting.

12:39.692 --> 12:40.727
When he shows,
we'll bring him in.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.095
Sounds good. Um...

12:43.030 --> 12:44.064
Keep me posted.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.539
Hey, I need a sec.

12:52.672 --> 12:53.706
Yeah. What's up?

12:53.841 --> 12:56.209
That's the annual review
paperwork, right?

12:57.845 --> 12:59.179
Unfortunately.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.714
You do mine yet?
Because if you haven't,

13:01.849 --> 13:03.250
I was hoping
to talk to you first.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.752
You know,
give you an update
about my condition

13:05.886 --> 13:07.520
before you report it
to Main Justice.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.957
Yeah, I was kind of
gearing up

13:10.090 --> 13:11.124
to ask you
about your headaches.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.960
They're so much better.
In fact,

13:13.093 --> 13:15.228
you may not really even
have to even mention them.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.763
If they're still happening...

13:16.897 --> 13:18.265
They're not, not really.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.001
I mean,
once in a great while,
but nothing like before.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.702
Now something needs
to trigger them,

13:22.836 --> 13:25.238
like an
extremely bright light
or super-loud noise.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.174
Alina.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.775
I'm not asking you
not to mention them.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.243
I-I realize
that would be improper.

13:30.377 --> 13:31.611
But if you didn't
feel the need to...

13:33.780 --> 13:36.149
Look, I love this job.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.817
You know how much I love
being in the field.

13:37.951 --> 13:41.121
I'm afraid if they see it,
they'll sit me down, and...

13:41.254 --> 13:42.255
I can't handle that.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.457
Right.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.525
So...

13:46.459 --> 13:47.260
We're good, then?

13:49.462 --> 13:51.164
I'm not sure I-I can
leave it out entirely.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.935
But I guess
I need to think about it.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.139
But I will.
Think about it.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.608
Thanks.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.488
Oh, Raymond,
you didn't have to.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.626
I often do
what I have to, Maureen,

14:19.759 --> 14:22.229
but this I did
because I wanted to.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.032
The instant you told me
about the gazebo,

14:25.165 --> 14:27.434
I knew I'd be back
to see it happen.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.302
Is it a thank-you?

14:29.436 --> 14:31.004
Does that mean
you found Clara Moore,

14:31.138 --> 14:32.405
the woman
I told you about?

14:32.539 --> 14:35.375
Not yet, but I have some
of my sharpest associates

14:35.508 --> 14:37.044
working on it as we speak.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.811
And I thought,
while I wait,

14:38.946 --> 14:42.215
we could spend
a little more time
together.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.483
I really do remind you
of her, don't I?

14:43.616 --> 14:45.418
Yes.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.654
We really are
very different,
you know.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.456
It's ironic,
don't you think?

14:49.589 --> 14:52.259
That I gave up a normal life
to catch a criminal,

14:52.392 --> 14:55.095
and Kate gave up
a normal life to become one.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.630
I've never asked you
about your decision

14:57.764 --> 15:00.400
to testify
against Alexei Lagunov.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.035
Do you regret it?

15:02.169 --> 15:04.471
I asked Kate for advice.

15:04.604 --> 15:07.240
When I saw those men
moving that man's body,

15:07.374 --> 15:09.076
I asked her
what I should do.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.111
And she said,
"Do nothing."

15:11.244 --> 15:13.513
Not because she was
afraid for me

15:13.646 --> 15:16.216
but because she
really didn't believe
it was any of my business.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.719
I remember
hanging up the phone

15:19.852 --> 15:21.254
knowing I was going
to call the police.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.355
Why?

15:23.390 --> 15:25.892
Probably because
she told me not to.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.494
I didn't
answer your question.

15:27.627 --> 15:28.828
Do I regret it?

15:29.997 --> 15:31.931
I did, for a long time.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.700
Kate wasn't the only one

15:33.833 --> 15:36.669
with dreams
of a bigger life,
excitement.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.338
I wanted to travel,

15:38.471 --> 15:41.541
told my mother
I'd become
the youngest curator

15:41.674 --> 15:43.743
in the history
of the Metropolitan Museum.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.748
All of that changed
when I took the stand.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.186
But I've come
to enjoy the quiet.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.156
I work part-time
at a bookstore in town.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.925
I'm on the board of the
Silver Glade Public Library.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.494
I have my garden.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.797
I think I've redefined
what I consider excitement.

16:04.931 --> 16:08.568
This life has been
plenty big for me.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.303
And I'm content.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.509
Somebody want to tell me
what this is about?

16:16.643 --> 16:17.844
Who are you people?
I need to get home.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.313
I think you know what this
is about, Mr. Graham.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.315
You left your print
at Virtual Horizons.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.950
I read your sheet.
Plenty of warning signs,

16:24.084 --> 16:25.785
but nine homicides?

16:25.918 --> 16:27.320
That's next level,
even for you.

16:27.454 --> 16:28.621
How do I know
this is real?

16:28.755 --> 16:30.490
You'll know when the judge
admits it at your trial.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.726
We know you work
for Laszlo Jankowics.

16:33.860 --> 16:34.994
I don't know
who that is.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.996
You call him Oroszlan.
Where can we find him?

16:38.531 --> 16:39.666
Where can you find
a Hungarian lion?

16:41.301 --> 16:42.369
Try the Budapest Zoo.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.337
You're going to prison.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.106
There's no need
to protect him now.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.274
Protect him?

16:48.808 --> 16:50.143
Look.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.179
I don't know the man,

16:52.312 --> 16:53.446
but I know his reputation.

16:54.614 --> 16:55.948
You want to talk about
next level?

16:56.083 --> 16:58.151
From what I hear,
he's done so much acid

16:58.285 --> 16:59.986
that his brain
is permanently damaged.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.354
He'd order your death
and then forget about it

17:01.488 --> 17:02.489
the second
he said the words.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.525
Oroszlan's the reason
you're here.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.628
Unless it was your idea

17:08.761 --> 17:10.597
to shoot up a room
full of innocent people.

17:13.633 --> 17:14.467
Well, they weren't
all innocent.

17:15.602 --> 17:16.636
What does that mean?

17:16.769 --> 17:18.871
If you know
about Oroszlan,

17:19.005 --> 17:20.673
then you know
that he inherited
his organization

17:20.807 --> 17:22.375
from his father.

17:22.509 --> 17:25.378
Sarkany built an empire,
but he didn't do it alone.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.714
He had a partner.
A chemist who knew

17:27.847 --> 17:29.582
how to turn
the ingredients Sarkany
got from Eastern Europe

17:29.716 --> 17:31.418
into product.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.987
Wallace Avery.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.289
He tried walking away.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.458
All this talk about people
spending billions

17:38.591 --> 17:40.493
to develop the same drugs
he'd been making for years?

17:42.362 --> 17:44.231
He cut Oroszlan out.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.499
Figured he had the experience
and the degrees to go legit.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.735
I won't help you
get Oroszlan.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.071
But Wallace Avery
can go to hell.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.476
Dembe.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.878
We haven't found Jankowics,

17:59.011 --> 18:02.282
but the key to that
may be a chemist
named Wallace Avery.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.551
Jankowics targeted
Virtual Horizon

18:04.684 --> 18:06.586
because Avery
used to work for him,

18:06.719 --> 18:08.355
but then he made a play
on his own.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.422
How can I help?

18:09.556 --> 18:10.690
We sent
units to his address,

18:10.823 --> 18:12.659
but he already cleared out.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.362
He knows Laszlo won't stop
looking until he's dead,

18:15.495 --> 18:16.896
so he's probably in hiding.

18:17.029 --> 18:20.567
I was thinking
maybe Rogelio
could find him.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.569
Send me the details,
and I'll reach out
right away.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.408
You're insane.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.744
And you're
a dead man walking.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.080
My people say
you've cleared out
of your apartment.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.782
What do you think
my dad would have
done to you, Wallace?

18:37.784 --> 18:41.454
What would he want me to do?

18:51.598 --> 18:53.466
He owns
a laundry business,

18:53.600 --> 18:55.802
but in reality,
he's the architect

18:55.935 --> 18:59.472
of one of
the best intelligence
networks in existence,

18:59.606 --> 19:04.177
an army of bellhops,
busboys, waiters,

19:04.311 --> 19:05.512
waitresses, housekeepers.

19:05.645 --> 19:09.115
Rogelio took people
who often go unseen

19:09.249 --> 19:14.120
and fused them into one,
great, all-seeing eye.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.923
Rogelio!
Thank you for coming.

19:17.056 --> 19:18.591
Mi amigo, I have to hurry.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.427
I told you,
I have an appointment.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.095
Yes, but perhaps
you could reschedule.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.764
Something's come up.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.999
Reschedule? No.
Oh, impossible.

19:27.133 --> 19:30.136
I didn't tell you,
but I applied
for my citizenship.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.672
Ah, after 20 years
of living in this country,

19:32.805 --> 19:34.941
I'm finally gonna be
a naturalized American.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.108
My word.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.544
Yeah,
my Civics interview's
in two hours.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.045
I waited over a year
for a time.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.949
I'm studying 120 questions
on American history
and government.

19:43.082 --> 19:46.152
And how many questions
will they actually ask you?

19:46.286 --> 19:47.820
Only 20, but I won't know
which ones.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.722
I have to get 12 right
to pass.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.558
I see.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.160
I've never been much
for pledges of allegiance,

19:54.294 --> 19:57.163
particularly when
it comes to governments,

19:57.297 --> 19:59.599
but I respect
and honor your decision.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.534
Two hours, you said?
Until the test.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.169
I'm going to my sister's
to study.

20:03.303 --> 20:06.339
I'll tell you what. There's
a man I need you to find.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.308
We think he's holed up
here in D.C.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.376
No, I can't.

20:09.509 --> 20:10.510
Hear me out.

20:10.643 --> 20:11.811
I'll give you the details,

20:11.944 --> 20:13.846
you reach out
to your network,

20:13.980 --> 20:16.949
and while we wait,
I'll help you study.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.152
Mr. March, thanks
for taking the time.

20:20.287 --> 20:22.154
Your assistant made it clear
your agenda was full.

20:22.289 --> 20:23.656
And you made it clear
you didn't care.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.525
Here I am.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.159
How can I help the FBI?

20:27.294 --> 20:29.028
We're investigating
two suspects.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.864
Two recent murder victims
we think you may be aware of.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.000
I'm confused.
Were they suspects
or victims?

20:34.133 --> 20:36.002
Both. An attorney named
Tyson Lacroix

20:36.135 --> 20:38.771
and a private investigator
named Reginald Cole.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.340
Lacroix and Cole are dead?

20:40.473 --> 20:41.674
So you knew them?

20:41.808 --> 20:43.109
Mr. March,
we'll cut right to it.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.712
We have evidence
that Reggie Cole was
engaged in blackmail,

20:45.845 --> 20:49.316
and we think that
Tyson Lacroix may also
have been involved.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.051
Now, your name came up
as someone they may have
been targeting.

20:54.754 --> 20:55.788
I always thought
blackmail meant

20:55.922 --> 20:57.089
paying someone
to stop them

20:57.223 --> 20:59.258
from revealing something
that you did.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.561
This was more
like extortion.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.332
I had some trouble recently.
A young woman who worked

21:05.465 --> 21:08.368
as a nanny for my son
made some accusations.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.269
What type of accusations?

21:10.403 --> 21:11.638
Sexual assault.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.707
Look, I have no interest
in rehashing her claims.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.676
Bottom line,
she went to the police,
filed a complaint,

21:16.809 --> 21:18.445
but no charges
were ever filed,

21:18.578 --> 21:19.912
so I thought that
was the end of it

21:20.046 --> 21:22.214
until Lacroix showed up
with his investigator

21:22.349 --> 21:23.816
and said he represented
the woman.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.586
He wanted money, or else
he'd file a lawsuit?

21:26.719 --> 21:28.254
That's right.
And as you know,

21:28.388 --> 21:30.690
burden in a civil trial,
lot lower than a criminal one.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.191
Did you reach
a settlement?

21:32.325 --> 21:33.760
Confidential one.

21:33.893 --> 21:37.029
Million five,
which I only paid
to spare my family.

21:37.163 --> 21:38.230
Look.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.934
You two look like
you know your business.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.836
I'm sure you don't need
my advice.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.271
We're listening.

21:45.405 --> 21:48.441
I'm not a detective,
but in my business,

21:48.575 --> 21:50.743
most mysteries get solved
if I do one key thing.

21:51.378 --> 21:52.379
And what's that?

21:53.079 --> 21:55.247
Follow the money.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.984
Okay,
now concentrate.
I'm picking up the pace.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.953
What founding document
was written in 1787?

22:01.087 --> 22:02.455
The U.S. Constitution.

22:02.589 --> 22:05.057
How many amendments
does the Constitution have?

22:05.191 --> 22:07.293
Twenty...seven?

22:07.427 --> 22:09.028
Are you asking me?

22:09.161 --> 22:10.096
Twenty-seven.
Final answer.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.666
The first 10 amendments
are known as...

22:13.800 --> 22:15.535
The Bill of Rights.
You're crushing this.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.770
Take a break,
have some water,
check the network.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.107
Nothing yet,
but we'll find him.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.274
One hour left.
Keep going.

22:22.409 --> 22:25.044
Name the three branches
of government.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.680
Executive, judicial, mm...

22:27.814 --> 22:28.681
Rogelio, we just
went over this.

22:28.815 --> 22:29.949
Yeah, I know.
I know this one.

22:30.082 --> 22:31.651
They write the laws.
I know, it's the people,

22:31.784 --> 22:32.985
the Congress, the...
I know.

22:33.119 --> 22:35.287
Okay, pass.
We'll come back to it.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.990
Name one writer of
The Federalist Papers.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.194
Big Lou just bought a beach
house in Margate because...

22:42.328 --> 22:44.163
Because he made
a boatload of cash

22:44.296 --> 22:45.398
scalping tickets
to Hamilton.

22:46.332 --> 22:48.768
Hamilton. Ah.
Boom!

22:48.901 --> 22:51.671
Why is it important
to pay federal taxes?

22:51.804 --> 22:53.440
Ugh. Don't answer that.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.508
I'm getting a little carsick.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.810
Ooh, I told you.
We found him.

22:57.944 --> 23:01.914
Your boy Wallace Avery's
in a motel by the airport.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.650
Clarissa just
brought him some towels.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.885
Clarissa just made
10 grand.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.954
Let me write down
the address for you.
Here.

23:12.291 --> 23:14.927
I can't thank you enough,
Rogelio.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.195
Good luck today.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.764
Gracias.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.800
Ah. Legislative.
That was the third branch.

23:20.933 --> 23:23.035
You see?
You've got this!

23:23.169 --> 23:24.537
Let me know how it goes.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.376
So, what now?

23:30.510 --> 23:32.178
Tell the task force
where to find Avery?

23:32.311 --> 23:34.647
Actually, I have
another idea in mind.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.692
Any sign of Oroszlan?

23:45.825 --> 23:48.027
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

23:49.529 --> 23:52.031
You're a very popular
fellow, Wallace.

23:52.164 --> 23:54.166
You already know
Laszlo Jankowics
is looking for you.

23:54.300 --> 23:57.103
Unfortunately,
the FBI is, too.

23:57.236 --> 23:59.639
They know you and Laszlo
used to work together.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.974
Oroszlan sent you
to kill me.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.776
No, no,
nothing like that.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.578
In fact, I'd rather
not get involved

24:05.712 --> 24:07.747
in the little dispute
you two are having.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.682
But I do need
to find someone,

24:09.816 --> 24:11.884
a woman you may know
named Clara Moore.

24:13.753 --> 24:14.453
You're looking for Clara?

24:14.587 --> 24:15.988
You do know her.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.457
My sources tell me
she works exclusively
for Laszlo,

24:18.591 --> 24:20.927
but we're having
a devil of a time
trying to find her.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.896
You won't. Only Oroszlan
knows how to reach Clara.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.598
And why is that?

24:25.732 --> 24:27.466
He's psychotic.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.268
And paranoid.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.604
And she literally knows
where all the bodies
are buried.

24:31.738 --> 24:33.305
Ah. I see.

24:34.807 --> 24:35.908
Well, that changes things.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.477
I'm sorry, Wallace,

24:38.611 --> 24:41.447
but it seems
I'll have to involve myself
in your dispute after all.

24:41.581 --> 24:42.815
What do you mean?

24:42.949 --> 24:43.983
Well, if Laszlo
is the only one

24:44.116 --> 24:45.852
who knows how
to reach Clara Moore,

24:45.985 --> 24:47.987
I'll have to give him
a good reason to do just that.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.428
What if Laszlo didn't
get the message?

24:57.697 --> 24:58.497
Patience, Weecha.

25:10.409 --> 25:11.510
Just him.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.119
Oh, oh.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.622
Stay.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.533
Raymond Reddington.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.068
I always hoped we'd meet.

25:36.202 --> 25:39.005
Oroszlan. We did meet.

25:39.138 --> 25:40.940
I was introduced
to your father once

25:41.073 --> 25:43.309
on a yacht in Monte Carlo
years ago.

25:43.442 --> 25:45.311
You were with him.
I'm sure you don't remember.

25:45.444 --> 25:47.814
You were just a boy
at the time.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.548
I was surprised
to get your call.

25:49.682 --> 25:52.351
Why would a man like you
want to do me a favor?

25:52.484 --> 25:54.821
No favors,
just business.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.890
When I heard you were down
a chemist, it occurred to me

25:58.024 --> 26:00.392
you may be running low
on product. Am I right?

26:00.526 --> 26:03.195
I made arrangements.
The Phan cartel
sent a shipment.

26:03.329 --> 26:04.764
Should get into the port
of D.C. today.

26:04.897 --> 26:08.434
Ah. Ask around.
Port security's
a specialty of mine.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.838
In the future, I'd be willing
to guarantee safe transport...

26:11.971 --> 26:13.372
For the right price,
of course.

26:13.505 --> 26:15.007
Now I know why they call you
the concierge of crime.

26:15.675 --> 26:16.809
Do they?

26:16.943 --> 26:18.410
Well, I'm a problem-solver.

26:18.544 --> 26:19.946
Like Wallace here.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.715
Your people have been
all over town looking
for him.

26:22.849 --> 26:25.184
Well, here he is,
a good-faith gesture

26:25.317 --> 26:27.153
to get our dealings off
on the right foot.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.221
Oroszlan, please,
you can't.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.057
Quiet.
He kills people!

26:31.190 --> 26:32.324
My staff!
He's a monster!

26:32.458 --> 26:33.726
I said quiet.
You can't hand me
over to him!

26:33.860 --> 26:35.027
Oh, for God's sake.
He's a killer...

26:35.161 --> 26:36.262
Oh!

26:40.332 --> 26:41.400
Hey.

26:41.533 --> 26:43.936
You're not gonna believe this.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.738
I just got off the phone
with Susan Powell,

26:45.872 --> 26:47.406
the woman who accused
March of assault.

26:47.539 --> 26:50.209
She's never even heard
of Tyson Lacroix
or Reginald Cole.

26:50.342 --> 26:51.310
Say that again?

26:51.443 --> 26:52.544
Lacroix
wasn't her lawyer.

26:52.679 --> 26:55.214
He went to March
claiming to represent her.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.249
He negotiated a settlement
for a million and a half.

26:57.383 --> 26:58.417
They've never even met.

26:58.550 --> 26:59.886
So it was just a scam.

27:00.687 --> 27:01.788
Just a scam?

27:01.921 --> 27:03.055
This is brilliant.

27:03.189 --> 27:05.124
I mean,
Cole found the cases,

27:05.257 --> 27:06.458
complaints made by victims

27:06.592 --> 27:08.327
that didn't result
in criminal charges.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.330
Now all Lacroix had to do
was claim to represent

27:11.463 --> 27:13.632
the victims
and then negotiate deals.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.467
It's meaningless.
It's inspired.

27:15.601 --> 27:17.203
I mean, I don't know how
I've never even heard of...

27:17.336 --> 27:19.405
Donald! I get that you
appreciate the ingenuity,

27:19.538 --> 27:20.807
but how does this keep me
out of prison?

27:20.940 --> 27:22.842
Panabaker was very clear.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.243
My best chance
to avoid prosecution

27:24.376 --> 27:27.079
is to give Main Justice
something big.

27:27.213 --> 27:28.614
The truth behind
a major conspiracy

27:28.748 --> 27:30.582
that caused Elizabeth's death
and my blackmail.

27:30.717 --> 27:31.684
Look, we're trying.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.285
Yeah, but what if
we're wasting our time?

27:33.419 --> 27:35.021
What if none of this
is connected to the
bigger picture?

27:35.154 --> 27:37.189
You can't think like that.
We've just got to keep
moving forward.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.858
I can't think like that?
That's easy for you to say!

27:38.991 --> 27:40.092
No, it's not, Harold!

27:40.226 --> 27:41.660
It's not easy
for any of us!

27:43.162 --> 27:44.096
I can't deal
with this right now.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.498
I've gotta clear my head.

27:46.632 --> 27:47.700
Where are you going?

27:47.834 --> 27:50.302
Home. To see my family
while I still can.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.507
You killed him!

27:55.641 --> 27:57.076
Well,
I thought you wanted
him dead.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.411
Not here! Not now!
He talked to the feds
this morning.

27:59.545 --> 28:00.679
I would've found out
what he told them first.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.081
Nothing, I'm sure.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.751
The man's hiding out
in an airport motel.

28:04.884 --> 28:07.519
If he talked to the feds,
he'd be locked
in a safe house.

28:07.653 --> 28:08.855
He was my chemist.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.022
You should've
let me handle it.

28:10.156 --> 28:11.323
You're over-thinking this.
Oh.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.225
You should go.
I'll make a call,

28:13.359 --> 28:15.127
have my Cleaner here
within the hour.

28:15.261 --> 28:17.696
Raymond.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.698
What?

28:19.832 --> 28:21.200
Oh, well, how was I
to remember that?

28:21.333 --> 28:23.202
What's the problem?
There's no problem.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.171
Apparently,
my best Cleaner

28:25.304 --> 28:27.139
is on a flight
somewhere over
the Atlantic.

28:27.273 --> 28:29.308
She went to take care
of something for me
in Tel Aviv.

28:29.441 --> 28:30.609
Oh.
Don't even worry about it.

28:30.743 --> 28:32.344
I'll use a backup.

28:32.478 --> 28:33.712
Although it occurs to me

28:33.846 --> 28:35.047
my next choice is in New York,

28:35.181 --> 28:36.282
so it may take
a couple of hours.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.850
A couple hours?
I know.

28:37.984 --> 28:39.685
I wonder if they do
turndown service here.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.053
I've got someone.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.454
No, no, no,
please, let me.

28:42.588 --> 28:44.723
I think you've done enough.
I'm getting out of here,

28:44.857 --> 28:45.892
and you should do the same.

28:46.025 --> 28:46.893
Well, if that's
what you want.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.294
I'm calling her now.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.561
I'll look
for my shell casings.

28:49.695 --> 28:51.163
Guys... Let's go.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.538
Well done, Wallace.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.542
Think he bought it?

29:03.675 --> 29:06.178
I do, which means
you need to leave town
immediately.

29:06.312 --> 29:07.814
Weecha will arrange it.

29:07.947 --> 29:08.981
Where am I going?

29:09.115 --> 29:10.116
How about Acapulco?

29:10.249 --> 29:11.717
You can set up shop,

29:11.851 --> 29:14.253
perhaps send us a sample
or two from time to time.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.387
Acapulco?

29:15.521 --> 29:16.588
Just a thought.

29:16.722 --> 29:18.858
Consider your death
a new lease on life.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.192
Ah.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.862
Please excuse me.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.733
Dembe, any luck finding
our little wack-job?

29:27.867 --> 29:29.368
None.
That's why I'm calling.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.904
I was hoping Rogelio found
his former chemist.

29:32.038 --> 29:33.539
Wallace Avery.

29:33.672 --> 29:35.174
In the wind, I'm sure.

29:35.307 --> 29:36.575
That said,
I do have another lead.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.344
I heard from a source

29:38.477 --> 29:42.081
that Laszlo's
expecting a shipment
from the Phan cartel

29:42.214 --> 29:43.415
to arrive today

29:43.549 --> 29:44.583
at the port in D.C.

29:44.716 --> 29:45.985
How reliable is the source?

29:46.118 --> 29:47.419
Pretty good, I think.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.688
And if he's right, and if
you're waiting at the port,

29:49.822 --> 29:52.224
perhaps you could grab Laszlo
along with the goods.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.302
Clara Moore, welcome.

30:03.435 --> 30:04.803
Please, come in.

30:08.074 --> 30:09.241
Hey. You wanted to see me?

30:09.375 --> 30:11.277
Yeah. Hey, please, come in.

30:14.646 --> 30:15.747
Look, um...

30:17.083 --> 30:19.085
I have been doing
a lot of thinking,

30:19.218 --> 30:22.088
and I have decided
that it is not my place

30:22.221 --> 30:23.255
to say anything
about your headaches.

30:25.091 --> 30:27.193
Wow. Uh, thank you.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.461
Uh, well, let me finish.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.663
See, um, the thing is,

30:31.797 --> 30:34.266
I haven't really been feeling,
uh, like myself lately.

30:35.968 --> 30:38.570
So it just feels wrong
for me to be evaluating you,

30:38.704 --> 30:40.272
all of you,

30:40.406 --> 30:42.975
when I have been going through
some struggles of my own.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.878
So I have decided

30:46.012 --> 30:49.481
that you should fill out
your own evaluation.

30:50.316 --> 30:51.350
Are you serious?

30:51.483 --> 30:52.284
Very.

30:53.119 --> 30:54.420
I trust you.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.855
If your headaches
aren't an issue,
don't report them.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.124
I'll submit
what you think is best.

31:10.669 --> 31:13.472
I suppose Cleaners have to go
where the work takes them.

31:13.605 --> 31:15.507
Although we both know
what Kate Kaplan would think

31:15.641 --> 31:18.477
of a buffoon like
Laszlo Jankowics.

31:18.610 --> 31:19.912
Still, I'm sure
he keeps you busy.

31:21.013 --> 31:22.481
Say something, Clara.

31:22.614 --> 31:23.815
You know exactly who I am,

31:23.950 --> 31:26.452
and I suspect you know
exactly why I'm here.

31:26.585 --> 31:27.719
Laszlo gave me up.

31:27.853 --> 31:29.021
Certainly not.

31:29.155 --> 31:31.057
Laszlo has no idea
we're meeting.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.324
Please, don't let me
keep you

31:32.458 --> 31:34.193
from doing
what you came here to do.

31:34.326 --> 31:35.327
You want me to clean?

31:35.461 --> 31:36.662
Indeed.

31:36.795 --> 31:39.465
Fortunately, it's mostly
corn syrup and food coloring,

31:39.598 --> 31:41.333
and if Kate Kaplan
taught you the trade,

31:41.467 --> 31:43.869
this should be
a walk in the park.

31:49.976 --> 31:52.211
Tac team stand by.
We have eyes
on the shipment.

31:52.344 --> 31:53.745
We're in position.

31:53.879 --> 31:56.048
Nobody moves
until Laszlo and his men
take possession.

31:56.182 --> 31:57.216
On your go.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.085
Sure that's the
right container?

31:59.218 --> 32:01.253
Has to be.
It originated in Jakarta

32:01.387 --> 32:03.622
where the Phan cartel
has people at the port.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.558
Manifest says it has
two dozen crates

32:06.692 --> 32:08.894
of spearmint-flavored
aerosol spray.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.329
Could be liquid LSD.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.098
Or Laszlo's a real stickler
for fresh breath.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.734
East entrance,
rolling in now.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.112
We have
Laszlo plus five.

32:26.245 --> 32:29.515
He must have a connection.
That's a port manager.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.655
I'm told
you and Kate were
very close at the end.

32:36.788 --> 32:37.623
Yes.

32:38.657 --> 32:39.391
I'm sorry.

32:40.859 --> 32:41.893
You're sorry?

32:42.028 --> 32:43.262
You murdered her.

32:45.731 --> 32:48.400
Okay, Clara, we've reached
the end of the friendly,

32:48.534 --> 32:51.337
get-to-know-you portion
of our little chat.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.905
I'm afraid
things get harder
from here.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.509
First, I didn't kill
Kate Kaplan.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.112
Fact is,
she took her own life.

33:00.246 --> 33:03.149
Second, I feel terribly
about that.

33:03.282 --> 33:06.118
Regardless of how she felt
about me at the time,

33:06.252 --> 33:08.054
we'd been friends
for many, many years,

33:08.187 --> 33:10.256
and I cared
a great deal for Kate.

33:10.389 --> 33:14.560
And I've had to live
with the circumstances
of her death ever since.

33:14.693 --> 33:15.994
That is, until yesterday,

33:16.128 --> 33:18.330
when it came to my attention

33:18.464 --> 33:20.199
that she may not
be dead after all.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.935
Kate's alive?

33:24.070 --> 33:26.172
I wonder, was that
a genuine question

33:26.305 --> 33:27.839
or just an attempt
to keep her hidden?

33:29.241 --> 33:30.442
I don't know
what that means.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.379
Not that it matters.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.981
I'd die before
I'd tell you anything.

33:36.115 --> 33:39.685
Here's an idea.
Why don't I introduce you
to an associate of mine?

33:40.552 --> 33:41.820
Brimley.

33:41.953 --> 33:43.322
Yes. You've heard of him.
No.

33:43.455 --> 33:44.756
I'm not surprised.
Please.

33:44.890 --> 33:46.292
No, no, no, not to worry.
No.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.760
You'll love him.
He and Kate were old friends.

33:53.132 --> 33:54.300
Wait for the hand-off.

33:57.303 --> 33:58.737
That's all we need.
Team Leader, move in.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.206
We're good to go.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.040
We got movement!
Two o'clock!

34:09.014 --> 34:10.816
Laszlo's running.
I see him.

34:22.961 --> 34:23.929
Drop the gun!

35:15.214 --> 35:16.848
Dembe, I don't have him!

35:18.984 --> 35:20.852
I'm coming.
Which way's he moving?

35:22.388 --> 35:23.722
Alina. Alina!

35:25.191 --> 35:26.325
Alina, are you okay?

35:32.198 --> 35:34.132
How do you feel?

35:34.266 --> 35:36.668
On the bright side,
I can hear and see again.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.570
But that would be
the only bright side.

35:40.439 --> 35:41.707
SWAT's been all over
the neighborhood.

35:41.840 --> 35:42.808
No sign of Laszlo.

35:44.042 --> 35:45.411
Or his lion.

35:49.215 --> 35:50.582
A round went off
inside the container.

35:51.783 --> 35:54.753
From then, I just...
Couldn't think.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.588
And then the sunlight
when I ran out again...

35:57.889 --> 35:59.791
Your two triggers...
Bright lights, loud sounds.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.362
Maybe you should let them
take you to the hospital.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.930
I've seen enough doctors.

36:05.063 --> 36:06.432
We both know
what happened and why.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.501
Worst part?

36:09.635 --> 36:10.769
It's not about me.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.003
I lost Laszlo.

36:13.071 --> 36:14.306
We needed him for Cooper.

36:16.074 --> 36:17.976
He's almost out of time.

36:22.748 --> 36:25.251
Hey. Thanks for calling.
How is she?

36:25.384 --> 36:26.885
Okay. You know,
pretty shaken up.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.321
And Laszlo?

36:29.455 --> 36:31.156
We lost him,
but it's not over.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.325
Dembe's got Metro P.D.
and half the Bureau
out looking.

36:37.629 --> 36:40.566
I went home,
saw my wife,

36:40.699 --> 36:42.634
lost a vicious game
of Crazy Eights to Agnes.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.437
What I'm saying
is that I took a minute

36:45.571 --> 36:48.206
to remember
what's important to me.

36:48.340 --> 36:51.610
And you, Donald,
you're high on that list.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.279
I'm sorry for earlier.
You don't have to say that.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.647
Yes, I do. I'm well aware
that the trouble I'm in

36:55.781 --> 36:57.583
is trouble
of my own making,

36:57.716 --> 37:00.218
trouble that's affecting
everyone around me.

37:00.352 --> 37:02.754
I'm sorry.
And if I haven't said it,

37:02.888 --> 37:04.823
thank you for doing
everything you can
to help me.

37:04.956 --> 37:06.091
You'd do the same
for me.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.326
Yes.

37:08.394 --> 37:09.495
The point is,
you were right.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.863
At the moment,
nothing makes sense.

37:11.997 --> 37:14.065
Maybe this scam
that Lacroix and Cole
were running

37:14.199 --> 37:16.368
is meaningless, or maybe
it's the key to everything.

37:16.502 --> 37:18.370
Only way to know is
to keep moving forward.

37:20.339 --> 37:21.139
It's Reddington.

37:22.308 --> 37:24.242
Raymond.
I don't have good news.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.211
You lost Laszlo Jankowics.

37:26.345 --> 37:27.646
Yes. How did you know?

37:27.779 --> 37:29.080
He just reached out
to Marvin,

37:29.214 --> 37:32.451
asking for my help in getting
out of town undetected.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.786
Not to worry, Harold.
He won't be going anywhere.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.556
Our little lion tamer
is in for a big surprise.

37:37.689 --> 37:39.458
It's an evening of surprises,

37:39.591 --> 37:41.560
and that one's not even
in the top two.

37:41.693 --> 37:42.694
I need to see you.

37:42.828 --> 37:43.929
Come to the warehouse.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.833
He has a line on Laszlo,
and he wants to talk.

37:47.966 --> 37:48.867
Tonight.

37:50.569 --> 37:51.703
You want to say that again?

37:51.837 --> 37:53.104
I'd rather not.

37:53.238 --> 37:54.606
You think
Kate Kaplan's alive?

37:54.740 --> 37:56.775
I didn't say that.
I said it's come
to my attention

37:56.908 --> 37:58.243
that she may be alive.

37:58.377 --> 38:00.546
And that's why you gave us
Laszlo Jankowics?

38:00.679 --> 38:03.048
To get to his Cleaner,
who knows for sure?

38:03.181 --> 38:05.884
I said
she may know for sure.
It's a fluid situation,

38:06.017 --> 38:07.886
which is why
I asked Brimley
to join us.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.054
Brimley's here?

38:09.187 --> 38:10.422
He is.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.758
I don't understand.
Kaplan survived that fall,

38:12.891 --> 38:15.394
and, what,
she's been in hiding
all these years?

38:15.527 --> 38:17.929
Unlikely, but unknown.

38:18.063 --> 38:20.432
If she'd lived,
she would have
needed help.

38:20.566 --> 38:22.067
The woman's name
is Clara Moore.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.403
She and Kate
were very close.

38:26.872 --> 38:29.741
I'm done, and I'm certain
she's telling the truth.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.010
What the hell is this?

38:32.143 --> 38:34.079
Like I said,
it's a fluid situation.

38:34.212 --> 38:35.614
Telling the truth
about what, Teddy?

38:35.747 --> 38:37.449
Is Kate alive or not?

38:37.583 --> 38:39.651
She don't know.
Until two days ago,

38:39.785 --> 38:41.520
she thought Kate was kaput
like the rest of us.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.689
But then she got a note.

38:43.822 --> 38:46.392
She came home.
It was in the bedroom
on her night table.

38:46.525 --> 38:49.795
And, yes, she's convinced
it's Kate's handwriting.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.830
She destroyed it,
so we can't be sure.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.064
Two days ago?

38:53.198 --> 38:54.265
That's her story.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.902
And believe me,
she's sticking to it.

38:57.035 --> 38:59.771
According to her,
the note said, uh...

38:59.905 --> 39:02.173
"Clara. I'm sorry.

39:02.307 --> 39:04.042
"So much to explain.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.512
"I'm hoping
you'll let me try."

39:06.645 --> 39:08.880
That's it. Then
an address downtown,

39:09.014 --> 39:10.716
00 p.m., Friday.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.284
That's tonight.
Less than two hours
from now.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.621
So much to explain?
Why now?

39:15.754 --> 39:17.956
After all this time,
why reach out like that?

39:19.558 --> 39:21.359
Let's take a ride, Harold.

39:21.493 --> 39:24.195
Who knows?
Maybe I'll be reacquainted

39:24.329 --> 39:26.297
with an old friend.

39:29.935 --> 39:32.203
Agent Park, hey.
Uh, you're here.

39:32.337 --> 39:33.972
Is everything all right?
I thought you were going home.

39:34.105 --> 39:37.075
I'm going now.
But I wanted to get this
back to you.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.012
I know I said my headaches
weren't an issue.

39:44.550 --> 39:48.153
Alina, I am so sorry.

39:48.286 --> 39:50.456
You don't have to worry
about reporting it.

39:50.589 --> 39:51.890
I did it myself.
It's all in there.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.726
Are you okay?

39:54.860 --> 39:58.864
I was pretty hard on Ressler
for putting the rest of us
at risk with his addiction.

39:58.997 --> 40:01.967
I may be disabled,
but I'm not a hypocrite.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.635
What if Main Justice
takes you out of the field?

40:03.769 --> 40:05.837
If they don't, you should.

40:07.539 --> 40:08.740
It's okay, Aram.

40:09.641 --> 40:11.209
Just send it.

40:19.518 --> 40:20.586
You believe it?

40:20.719 --> 40:22.253
Elizabeth's death,
Doug Koster,

40:22.387 --> 40:25.390
that poor bartender,
my blackmail.

40:25.524 --> 40:26.992
I'm sitting here,
trying to understand

40:27.125 --> 40:29.995
how or why Mr. Kaplan
could have done it all.

40:33.632 --> 40:36.902
I've often wondered
what I'd say to her
if I had the chance.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.437
And?

40:42.608 --> 40:46.444
The prospect
is more overwhelming
than I'd imagined.

40:47.546 --> 40:49.247
Seeing her again?

40:49.380 --> 40:50.148
And what?

40:52.518 --> 40:53.919
What do I do
if it is her, Harold?

41:07.933 --> 41:08.900
Oh, my...

41:09.601 --> 41:10.335
There she is.

41:12.704 --> 41:13.672
Oh, my God.

41:13.805 --> 41:14.906
It really is her.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.909
I don't know if I'm ready
to do this.

41:22.548 --> 41:24.415
You stay here.
Watch that window.

41:24.550 --> 41:25.917
We got this.

41:29.387 --> 41:30.455
Are you sure, Weecha?

41:30.589 --> 41:31.790
I'm sure.

41:53.645 --> 41:55.614
We're
in the stairwell,
moving to the third floor.

41:57.415 --> 41:59.685
Two down. She had guards
watching the stairwell.

41:59.818 --> 42:01.953
Kate heard the shots.
She knows you're inside.

42:02.087 --> 42:03.454
No, no, move, move!

42:03.589 --> 42:05.857
Weecha. Weecha,
what's happening?
Move!

42:05.991 --> 42:08.126
We're losing transmission.

42:08.259 --> 42:09.460
Weecha, she knows
you're coming!

42:09.595 --> 42:10.461
You need to get
out of there now!

42:11.930 --> 42:13.732
Go! Back, go! It's a trap!

42:17.302 --> 42:19.137
Weecha! Weecha!
