up here.

18:37.725 --> 18:40.031

18:40.075 --> 18:42.599
It's a double murder.

18:42.643 --> 18:43.992
I think it's a double murder.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.168
- Yeah.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.562
Just outside of town.

we've been in touch at all.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.569
with that woman
a few months ago.

a deal of that thing.

I know you haven't been back
here in a long time,

you could come up here

19:09.713 --> 19:11.672

19:11.715 --> 19:15.502
The reason is the suspect,
he's young.

19:15.545 --> 19:19.201
Really young.
Like, maybe 11 years old.

19:19.245 --> 19:22.161
Honestly, I have a lot

they ingested something.

23:34.325 --> 23:35.892
But the bloodstains
and the water,

23:35.936 --> 23:38.242

them and then he arranged
