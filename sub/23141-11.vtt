00:01.653 --> 00:03.873
Lady Luck
is on your side
fromLA to Vegas.

00:03.916 --> 00:07.181
What, are you gonna put
a sock on the cockpit door?Don't cockpit-block me.

00:07.224 --> 00:08.443
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.271
And check out our other Fox programs,

00:10.314 --> 00:12.055
The Mick, The Last Man on Earth,

00:12.099 --> 00:13.317
and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

00:13.361 --> 00:14.753
The kids are gonna love it.

00:14.797 --> 00:15.972
Only on Fox.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.198
-Yes.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.330
That's why we're all
standing here like fools,

00:26.374 --> 00:28.071
-because he's already arrived.
-Ooh. Someone's on edge.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.291
You back on those
Norwegian diet pills?

00:30.334 --> 00:32.902
We're all on edge, Ronnie.
We're about to meet the owner

00:32.945 --> 00:34.686
of Jackpot Airlines;
he's an actual billionaire.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.862
I've never met a billionaire.
Or a millionaire.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.864
I used to love
being around rich people.

00:38.908 --> 00:41.345
But now they're all just nerds,
riding fold-up bicycles.

00:41.389 --> 00:43.478
It's crazy.
This guy can change our lives

00:43.521 --> 00:46.133
or destroy us
with the snap of his fingers.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.482
Oh, no, no.
Jack Silver isn't like that.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.223
He's not your standard,
snobby rich guy.

00:49.266 --> 00:51.790
He's self-made, chill,
and totally down-to-earth.

00:51.834 --> 00:55.272
He's a recovering addict.
He's done all 36 steps.

00:55.316 --> 00:57.970
-12.
-He's done them three times.

01:06.022 --> 01:08.111
I am not Jack Silver.

01:12.289 --> 01:14.987
-Iam Jack Silver.

01:15.031 --> 01:16.989
Greetings, my Jackpot family!

01:19.253 --> 01:21.037
See? He's totally down-to-earth.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.691
What was that?

01:22.734 --> 01:25.563
:
He's totally down-to-earth!

01:25.607 --> 01:26.738
PILOT :
Jackpot Airlines.

01:26.782 --> 01:28.566
Northeast-bound to Las Vegas.

01:28.610 --> 01:31.569
♪

01:35.617 --> 01:37.314
Hi. Jack Silver.
Nice to meet you.

01:37.358 --> 01:38.794
Jack Silver.

01:38.837 --> 01:42.145
Captain Dave.
I'll be your pilot.

01:42.189 --> 01:44.756
It's my honor to be the man
who gets to please you today.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.150
Let me tell you something, Dave.
Can I call you Dave?

01:47.194 --> 01:48.804
Of course I can.
I own the airline.

01:48.847 --> 01:50.588
I could call you Tessa
if I wanted to.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.938
Make you wear a baby bonnet,
put a pacifier in your mouth

01:52.982 --> 01:55.158
and fly the plane that way,
but I'm not gonna do that.

01:55.202 --> 01:57.160
-Thank you.
-You see, Tessa,

01:57.204 --> 02:01.033
between us boys, today's flight
is kind of a P.R. move.

02:01.077 --> 02:02.992
Show that I'm a man
of the people.

02:03.035 --> 02:05.516
You know, I've been suffering
a little bad press lately.

02:05.560 --> 02:09.216
Turns out one of my companies
manufactures allergy pens

02:09.259 --> 02:11.305
in converted peanut factories.

02:11.348 --> 02:14.830
Man, that got people really mad.

02:14.873 --> 02:17.311
And sick, I guess.

02:17.354 --> 02:19.356
When I was a kid,
there weren't allergies,

02:19.400 --> 02:21.271
just swollen days
and un-swollen days.

02:21.315 --> 02:24.448
I got a good feeling about you,
kid.

02:26.494 --> 02:27.843
Mr. Silver. Hi.

02:27.886 --> 02:29.627
We just wanted
to introduce ourselves.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.412
-We're your flight crew today.
-Oh.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.805
You guys are the heart and soul
of the airline.

02:33.849 --> 02:35.764
That's why I look in-house

02:35.807 --> 02:39.071
when I hire crew for my
private plane, Jack Force One.

02:39.115 --> 02:41.073
It's a heck of an opportunity.

02:41.117 --> 02:43.075
World travel, exotic locales,

02:43.119 --> 02:46.427
real expensive,
and real funky cheese.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.777
Play your cards right,
who knows,

02:48.820 --> 02:50.866
one of you could be next.

02:52.955 --> 02:55.479
At the risk of sounding
profoundly British,

02:55.523 --> 02:57.307
-Oh.

02:57.351 --> 02:58.787
Jack Silver,
who runs Jackpot Airlines,

02:58.830 --> 03:00.571
is gonna be on our flight today.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.573
-Artem's not happy.
-Yeah, when I heard

03:02.617 --> 03:04.619
there's gonna be
a celebrity on our flight,

03:04.662 --> 03:06.795
I put a bet on Michael Jackson.

03:06.838 --> 03:09.624
-Um, he's dead.
-Yeah, I know that now.

03:09.667 --> 03:12.017
Oh, I'm on a cold streak.

03:12.061 --> 03:13.889
There's no such thing
as cold streaks.

03:13.932 --> 03:16.108
You're more likely
making poor bets.

03:16.152 --> 03:18.502
You have to select wagers
that are pragmatic

03:18.546 --> 03:20.504
and mathematically advantageous.

03:20.548 --> 03:23.464
That is why-- not to brag--
I've yet to lose a wager.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.509
You think you're so smart
because you've never lost a bet?

03:25.553 --> 03:28.120
I think Artem and I can
come up with a bet you'll lose.

03:28.164 --> 03:29.383
Okay, well, good luck.

03:29.426 --> 03:30.819
You know,
I welcome the challenge.

03:30.862 --> 03:33.909
Also, did you really not know
that Michael Jackson was dead?

03:33.952 --> 03:36.694
Ah, my Internet was out
for most of 2009.

03:36.738 --> 03:39.088
But it's working now.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.703
-Nothing.

03:45.747 --> 03:48.924
Don't lie to me.
You reek of citrus and deceit.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.969
Fine. I'm trying
to impress Jack, okay?

03:51.013 --> 03:53.320
I read on his Wikipedia
that his favorite drink

03:53.363 --> 03:54.930
is rainwater and lime.

03:54.973 --> 03:56.279
Oh, Ronnie.
Much like chunky jewelry,

03:56.323 --> 03:58.499
desperation is
a bad look on you.

03:58.542 --> 04:01.502
Really? Okay, well,
what's in yourbag?

04:01.545 --> 04:02.764
Well, well, well.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.287
If it isn't the pot

04:04.331 --> 04:07.464
calling the kettle
bla... frican-American.

04:07.508 --> 04:09.510
Let's just admit it,
we both want that job.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.729
You get to travel the world;
I can finally go to Morocco

04:11.773 --> 04:13.514
and deal with my rug trader
in person.

04:13.557 --> 04:14.950
I know Umer's scamming me.

04:14.993 --> 04:17.431
Bernard, you don't want to get
into a competition with me.

04:17.474 --> 04:19.302
You know I do
all the dirty work around here.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.782
If Cher held yourhand

04:20.825 --> 04:22.653
during her Heart of Stone
world tour,

04:22.697 --> 04:25.134
you wouldn't use it to touch
filthy duffel bags, either.

04:25.177 --> 04:26.527
Oh. Let's just ask Nichole.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.006
Nichole, who's the better
flight attendant,

04:28.050 --> 04:29.399
-Come on, guys.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.358
You're putting me
in really difficult... Bernard.

04:31.401 --> 04:34.535
-Bernard just
makes it look so effortless.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.406
You're always running around
all pissed and stressed

04:36.450 --> 04:38.190
and pit stain-y.

04:38.234 --> 04:41.019
Yeah. That's because I'm the one
actually doing stuff.

04:41.063 --> 04:42.978
You know, I can't believe you.

04:43.021 --> 04:44.806
We almost went
to the Women's March together.

04:44.849 --> 04:47.765
-You're the one that overslept.
-Yeah, I said almost.

04:49.245 --> 04:51.334
-DAVE: Captain Dave here.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.336
You know when you're
on a roll at the tables

04:53.380 --> 04:55.947
and you don't want to go
to sleep and your dealer's MIA?

04:55.991 --> 04:58.559
Then do what I do:
get a B12 shot

04:58.602 --> 05:01.997
from Dr. Legit on level three of
the Bellagio parking structure.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.390
Cash only.

05:03.433 --> 05:06.567
What are you doing
so close to a piece of meat

05:06.610 --> 05:08.699
-Oh, it's Jack's lunch.

05:08.743 --> 05:11.223
He personally asked me
to prepare it for him.

05:11.267 --> 05:15.445
So it looks like all my hard
work is finally gonna pay off,

05:15.489 --> 05:17.447
and I'll be the one
traveling the world,

05:17.491 --> 05:20.015
jet-setting from Bangkok to...

05:20.058 --> 05:22.017
It should not take you that long

05:22.060 --> 05:23.584
to think of
a second foreign city.

05:23.627 --> 05:26.238
Also, you're doing that wrong.
You forgot the sauce.

05:26.282 --> 05:29.024
-I love you,
but this is my destiny.

05:29.067 --> 05:31.287
No! Hey! Give that back!

05:33.289 --> 05:34.943
It's okay.
Five-second rule.

05:34.986 --> 05:36.510
It's not okay.
I've thrown away shoes

05:36.553 --> 05:38.773
that have touched this carpet.
Just make another one.

05:38.816 --> 05:40.078
There isn't another one.

05:40.122 --> 05:41.863
Jack's personal chef
prepared it for him.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.604
He has a very sensitive stomach.

05:43.647 --> 05:45.257
-Okay, here.

05:45.301 --> 05:47.390
Just, um...

05:47.434 --> 05:49.392
There. Wipe it off.

05:49.436 --> 05:50.785
All right, there we go. See?

05:50.828 --> 05:53.222
Good as new.
It's like it never happened.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.009
-Oh.

05:58.053 --> 05:59.707
-Mm.
-Thank you.

06:02.884 --> 06:06.278
You see? All good.
Crisis averted.

06:06.322 --> 06:09.281
-Crisis enlarged.
-Oh... that's bad.

06:09.325 --> 06:10.587
This is officially
the first time

06:10.631 --> 06:12.328
I've ever hated being on camera.

06:15.679 --> 06:19.074
You boys mind if I fly the
friendlies with you for a while?

06:19.117 --> 06:21.642
Mind? We'd be honored.

06:21.685 --> 06:24.645
-Alan, get your ass up.
-Yes, sir!

06:24.688 --> 06:26.560
Have a seat, Mr. Silver.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.475
Thank you.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.477
This takes me back
to my old flying days.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.262
I still use a lot of lessons
from back then, like:

06:33.305 --> 06:36.439
Wherever you go, always carry
a gun and a parachute.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.876
And don't buy either
from an Irish.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.313
You're a fountain of knowledge
I can't stop drinking from.

06:41.357 --> 06:43.707
Well, you see, Dave,
the secret to business,

06:43.751 --> 06:46.667
and life,
is to underthink it, buddy.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.669
-Mm.
-I talk about it all in my book,

06:48.712 --> 06:50.235
Underthink It, Buddy.

06:50.279 --> 06:51.802
I loved that one.
It was so brave

06:51.846 --> 06:53.674
to release a book
with so many spelling errors.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.284
What about you, Dave?

06:55.327 --> 06:57.547
You got any big swings
left in those arms?

06:57.591 --> 06:59.680
-I'm living my dream.

06:59.723 --> 07:00.898
I'm a pilot.

07:00.942 --> 07:03.335
If you're doing it awake,
it can't be your dream.

07:03.379 --> 07:04.902
Come on, what is it?

07:04.946 --> 07:07.122
I... I don't know.

07:07.165 --> 07:11.474
Let me underthink it for you.
Your dream is to open a bar.

07:11.518 --> 07:14.346
You look like a guy
that can sling drinks.

07:14.390 --> 07:15.696
Oh, wow.

07:15.739 --> 07:17.524
I never knew it
until this moment,

07:17.567 --> 07:20.265
but you're absolutely right.
I can see it now.

07:20.309 --> 07:22.093
I'm pouring drinks,
there's a band playing.

07:22.137 --> 07:24.095
My accountant comes in
and says, "Captain Dave,

07:24.139 --> 07:26.533
you've run out of funds.
We have to close the bar."

07:26.576 --> 07:28.839
But I say, "Wait, this is just
the beginning of my dream.

07:28.883 --> 07:31.712
I never got to serve
my signature drink: beer."

07:31.755 --> 07:33.496
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:
Jackpot 1610, we got a call in

07:33.540 --> 07:35.324
for Jack Silver
from someone named Tito.

07:35.367 --> 07:38.719
Oh. It's my attorney.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.636
Hey, Tito.

07:42.679 --> 07:45.595
W
: Oh.

07:45.639 --> 07:49.860
Gonna be a ton of media waiting
for me in Vegas.

07:49.904 --> 07:52.515
Okay, FBI is
gonna be there, too.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.517
It's the allergy pen thing.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.519
I'm being indicted.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.913
Ooh, indicted?
Like into the Hall of Fame?

07:58.956 --> 08:00.958
No, that's inducted, stupid.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.134
Indicted means he's probably
gonna be arrested.

08:03.178 --> 08:05.223
Oh, you should meet my dad.
He's a lawyer.

08:05.267 --> 08:08.009
Oh, but he's in jail.
Oh, but you could meet my dad.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.799
Hey, buddy.

08:15.843 --> 08:18.367
I was just coming over
to see if you need anything.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.108
Pretzels

08:20.151 --> 08:22.197
Are you gonna rub them
all over the floor first?

08:22.240 --> 08:25.548
Oh, my God.
You saw that?

08:25.592 --> 08:27.724
Cool, cool, cool.

08:27.768 --> 08:31.206
Uh, just wondering, when you had
your phone up earlier,

08:31.249 --> 08:32.990
-Obvi.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.426
That's short for "obviously."

08:34.470 --> 08:35.558
Yeah, I know
what it's short for.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.429
Once we land, and I get Wi-Fi,

08:37.473 --> 08:39.170
I'm posting this thing
all over my social media.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.215
Why would you do that?

08:40.258 --> 08:42.260
Because people love
bad airline videos.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.175
I'm finally gonna go viral.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.395
I'm gonna dab with Ellen
on daytime TV.

08:46.438 --> 08:48.658
Quick sidebar.

08:50.225 --> 08:51.792
Okay, Mr. Brain Boy.

08:51.835 --> 08:55.796
Uh, we've been talking,
and we have a bet for you.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.580
You think you're so good
with math and probabilities,

08:57.624 --> 09:00.583
but we bet you can't predict
what time this plane will land.

09:00.627 --> 09:03.673
Oh, dear. See, this is why
I don't lose at bets,

09:03.717 --> 09:05.632
because that is a bet
I would never take.

09:05.675 --> 09:07.808
Here's why. Firstly, I have
no control over the outcome.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.374
I'm not flying the plane.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.507
Secondly, there are
too many variables:

09:11.551 --> 09:13.596
weather, wind speed,

09:13.640 --> 09:15.424
if Captain Dave
forgot his keys again.

09:15.467 --> 09:18.862
-So much talking.
-Hey, that's a bet.

09:18.906 --> 09:23.650
We bet that you can only say
150 words for the entire flight.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.086
-ARTEM: That's so good!

09:25.129 --> 09:27.828
-Because he never shuts up.
-Yes.

09:27.871 --> 09:32.006
I'm gonna put $1,000
on that bet.

09:32.049 --> 09:34.399
Well, I am in control
of what I say,

09:34.443 --> 09:37.054
so I will take that bet.
You're on.

09:37.098 --> 09:39.666
-Okay.
-Poor choice of bets, my friend.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.493
Oh, that's nine words.

09:41.537 --> 09:43.844
-That was six.
-Now it's nine.

09:43.887 --> 09:48.283
Ah, this is gonna be
like taking shoes from baby.

09:49.893 --> 09:54.202
Don't you want to ask me
what I do with those baby shoes?

09:54.245 --> 09:57.640
You should.
It's pretty weird.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.294
RONNIE :
It's okay. Five-second rule.

09:59.337 --> 10:00.687
We are screwed, Bernard.

10:00.730 --> 10:02.471
Why did you have to steal
that steak from me?

10:02.514 --> 10:03.820
Why'd you have to drop it?
What's the point

10:03.864 --> 10:05.779
of your lumberjack hands if
you can't hold on to anything?

10:05.822 --> 10:07.868
You know what? The next time
there's a bird loose

10:07.911 --> 10:09.043
in the house,
you're catching it yourself.

10:09.086 --> 10:10.305
It doesn't matter anyway.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.002
If we don't get that video back
and he posts it,

10:12.046 --> 10:14.309
-we're gonna lose our jobs.
-Oh, man.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.050
The only thing worse than
working for Jackpot

10:16.093 --> 10:17.573
is being fired from Jackpot.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.531
I mean, what do you even do
after that?

10:19.575 --> 10:21.882
You work for Greyhound.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.536
Oh, my God.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.800
BOTH:
We have to get that video back.

10:26.843 --> 10:28.236
BERNARD :
I've thrown away shoes

10:28.279 --> 10:29.585
that have touched this carpet.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.543
The FBI clearly has
the wrong man.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.850
Ugh. It's so easy to blame
the white billionaires.

10:33.894 --> 10:35.765
Eh, it's no big deal.

10:35.809 --> 10:38.333
Guy like me, being indicted
is like a rite of passage,

10:38.376 --> 10:40.291
like buying
your first congressman.

10:40.335 --> 10:42.903
So cool. Most guys would run
away from that type of thing,

10:42.946 --> 10:45.122
but you face it head on,
like a man.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.081
You damn right.

10:47.124 --> 10:50.562
So let's turn this bird around
and fly to Mexico, like a man.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.086
-Keep up, Dave.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.958
The police are waiting for me
in Vegas. We can't go there.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.917
The sad truth is
there's only one place

10:56.960 --> 10:59.484
that a man of my stature
can get justice in America,

10:59.528 --> 11:00.703
and that's Mexico.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.618
I can't just fly
all these people down

11:02.662 --> 11:04.315
-to Central America.
-Come on.

11:04.359 --> 11:05.839
It'll be an adventure.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.928
Two handsome fugitives
on the run.

11:07.971 --> 11:08.885
We don't even
have to learn Spanish.

11:08.929 --> 11:10.713
We'll just speak English louder.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.498
Actually, I already
hablaSpanish, but no.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.805
-This is un poquitocrazy.
-Dave,

11:15.849 --> 11:18.808
I didn't want to have to play
this card, but I am your boss.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.331
There's two ways this can go:

11:20.375 --> 11:22.377
stay on course to Vegas,
I fire you;

11:22.420 --> 11:25.772
or fly me to Mexico,
and I bankroll your bar.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.605
Hey, Colin. Guess spilling
your tea on that old lady

11:33.649 --> 11:35.651
really shaved
some words off, huh?

11:35.695 --> 11:37.348
That was quite the apology.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.002
-63.

11:39.046 --> 11:40.569
You know, I recently
heard a phrase,

11:40.612 --> 11:42.658
"Those who can, do;
those who can't, teach."

11:42.702 --> 11:45.400
Do you have an opinion on that?

11:45.443 --> 11:47.794
Oh, I realized
you never finished telling me

11:47.837 --> 11:51.319
why economics is technically
a romance language.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.625
He's holding out
better than we thought.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.845
Guess there's something
to a Cambridge education.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.455
Oxford! It was Oxford!

11:57.499 --> 11:58.935
I wouldn't be caught dead
at Cambridge.

11:58.979 --> 12:01.329
Haven't you heard the song,
"Cambridge, we're lamebridge,

12:01.372 --> 12:02.896
we're Oxford's drainage"?

12:02.939 --> 12:05.855
-Gotcha.
-Gotcha good.

12:08.031 --> 12:10.120
Hey, buddy.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.035
I don't know if you know this,

12:12.079 --> 12:14.995
but once we hit 30,000 feet,
there's no age limit.

12:15.038 --> 12:19.826
So if you want a beer,
we could totally work that out.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.871
Alcohol isn't even cool anymore.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.178
You know what is?
Keeping all of your brain cells.

12:24.221 --> 12:26.615
All right, let's get
down to business, kid.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.225
Between the two of us,
we have...

12:28.269 --> 12:29.923
I've got $213.

12:29.966 --> 12:32.229
We have exactly 200 bucks.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.797
I need to borrow $13.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.452
I don't want your money.
My family is rich.

12:37.495 --> 12:40.020
We eat at Benihana
even when it's not my birthday.

12:40.063 --> 12:43.632
You are never, ever
getting this video back.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.986
This is not fair.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.293
I have been working for
this company for five years,

12:52.336 --> 12:54.861
and this is the moment
that everyone's gonna see?

12:54.904 --> 12:57.080
No one notices that I work
my ass off for this airline.

12:57.124 --> 12:59.387
I've sacrificed friendships,
my health.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.693
-Look what the altitude's done
to my hair. -Damn!

13:01.737 --> 13:03.434
One of your split ends
just shanked me.

13:03.478 --> 13:06.220
Just once, I would like
a little recognition.

13:06.263 --> 13:08.744
A-A little credit.
A genuine thank you.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.051
-Thank you.
-I said genuine.

13:11.094 --> 13:12.008
Thank you.

13:12.052 --> 13:15.620
-Your fake sincerity is
scary good. -Thank you.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.057
Ronnie, can we chat
in my office?

13:17.100 --> 13:18.972
I've got a delicate situation.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.843
This is a highly sensitive
matter, Bernard,

13:20.887 --> 13:23.977
-or I'd invite you, too.
-Thank you.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.456
So, let me get this straight.

13:25.500 --> 13:29.112
Jack Silver is wanted by the FBI
and offered to buy you a bar...

13:29.156 --> 13:30.505
My lifelong dream.

13:30.548 --> 13:32.855
...if you agree to turn
this plane around and fly him

13:32.899 --> 13:35.727
and all of our paying passengers
to Mexico.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.729
And you're asking me
if that's okay?

13:37.773 --> 13:39.340
-Yes, that's right.
-Dave.

13:39.383 --> 13:42.082
Fine, fine. I was hoping
to get Fun Ronnie on this one,

13:42.125 --> 13:45.128
not Rules Ronnie.
I know I can't actually do it.

13:45.172 --> 13:47.000
Damn it, I hate being right
all the time.

13:47.043 --> 13:50.264
-Oh, yeah, sure.

13:59.142 --> 14:01.057
Hey, Jack.

14:01.101 --> 14:03.494
I'm a little locked out.
Can you let me in?

14:03.538 --> 14:05.105
Sorry, man. No can do.

14:06.497 --> 14:07.585
I'm the captain now,

14:07.629 --> 14:09.936
and we're headed to "Me-hi-co."

14:16.594 --> 14:18.031
-Shh.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.728
If the passengers hear
that we've been

14:19.771 --> 14:20.903
:
hijacked,

14:20.947 --> 14:23.036
-they'll freak out.
-All right, let's calm down.

14:23.079 --> 14:24.907
Is this technically even an HJ?

14:24.951 --> 14:26.387
I mean, it's his plane.
He owns it.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.563
You can't HJ yourself.

14:28.606 --> 14:29.912
I have to talk quickly

14:29.956 --> 14:31.783
while Nichole and Artem
aren't watching.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.134
Please tell me what's going on.
Should I be worried?

14:34.177 --> 14:35.962
What's with all
the hushed tones?

14:36.005 --> 14:36.963
Okay, here's the update.

14:37.006 --> 14:39.748
That's 26 words, Artem.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.619
You're down to five words.

14:41.663 --> 14:43.273
Et tu, Bernard?

14:43.317 --> 14:45.145
He just used Latin.
Does that count?

14:45.188 --> 14:46.494
Uh, that counts double.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.539
Yeah, no more words for you.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.628
Everything's fine.
Just go back to your seat.

14:53.109 --> 14:56.199
-Oh. Jack.

14:56.243 --> 14:58.332
I just wanted to say thanks
for being so cool

14:58.375 --> 15:00.812
-about me taking the plane.
-No one is cool about this.

15:00.856 --> 15:03.206
You can't just freak out every
time you don't get your way

15:03.250 --> 15:04.512
and say, "Let's go to Mexico."

15:04.555 --> 15:06.296
You're not my dad
after a custody hearing.

15:06.340 --> 15:09.038
It's just a quick stop.
You'll drop me off,

15:09.082 --> 15:10.953
and then you'll do
whatever all this is.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.608
Alan, can you hear me?
You're the only one

15:13.651 --> 15:15.131
who can stop this.
Do something!

15:15.175 --> 15:16.393
ALAN:
Okay!

15:18.439 --> 15:20.615
Just an opportunity
to prove your life matters.

15:20.658 --> 15:23.009
Wow. My horoscope
was dead-on this morning.

15:23.052 --> 15:23.966
Oh, we should use

15:24.010 --> 15:25.620
the override code
to get into the cockpit.

15:25.663 --> 15:27.404
Jack changed it
once he took over.

15:27.448 --> 15:31.147
Oh, my God.
Well, if that's the case...

15:35.238 --> 15:37.240
The code was 1111.
He underthunk it.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.068
That guy should
regular think sometimes.

15:42.811 --> 15:45.248
Hey. You guessed the code.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.250
You must've read my book.

15:47.294 --> 15:49.035
Yeah. It wasn't a hard read.

15:49.078 --> 15:51.994
Last 20 pages were you
just thanking your boats.

15:54.170 --> 15:56.651
This must be hard for you, eh?

15:56.694 --> 15:59.219
Because you can't say anything,

15:59.262 --> 16:02.874
and I can say everything.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.876
So, have you been
to Redondo Beach?

16:04.920 --> 16:06.269
I like Redondo Beach.

16:06.313 --> 16:09.055
Isn't "Redondo"
a very funny word?

16:09.098 --> 16:11.883
:
Redondo. Redondo.

16:11.927 --> 16:14.843
:
Redondo. Redondo.

16:14.886 --> 16:17.280
♪ Redondo, Redondoo♪

16:17.324 --> 16:18.629
♪ Redondoo...♪

16:18.673 --> 16:21.893
Jack, you can't
take this plane to Mexico.

16:21.937 --> 16:24.026
Let's talk about this
when I get back from Mexico.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.724
There's nothing you're gonna say
that's gonna talk me out of it.

16:26.768 --> 16:29.771
But I give you "A" for effort,
and you make a heck of a steak.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.297
Right, your steak.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.430
There is something
you should know about that,

16:36.473 --> 16:39.433
and your delicate tummy
might not like it.

16:45.874 --> 16:48.355
All right, someone go
point us back to Vegas.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.319
Hey, passengers.
Sorry for the delay.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.060
We are now starting our descent.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.410
Flight attendants,
please prepare for landing.

17:00.454 --> 17:03.283
Well, that's my cue.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.461
All right.

17:07.504 --> 17:08.505
Hold that.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.292
Been a strange flight.

17:12.335 --> 17:15.077
Mostly 'cause of me.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.732
I think it'd be better
for everyone-- mostly me--

17:17.775 --> 17:20.517
if I just left.

17:20.561 --> 17:23.955
Can I get that parachute back?
Thanks, champ.

17:23.999 --> 17:27.307
You're easy to talk to.

17:33.139 --> 17:36.142
What are you doing?
Why making "T"?

17:36.185 --> 17:39.623
Oh! Ronnie, Colin wants his tea!

17:41.712 --> 17:43.975
Everybody, a man is
about to jump off the plane!

17:47.283 --> 17:50.112
I know you have a lot of choices
when you fly.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.288
Thanks for flying Jackpot.

17:59.948 --> 18:03.299
That was ten words.
You lose the bet.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.353
On behalf of Jackpot,

18:13.396 --> 18:16.225
we apologize
for the incident on the plane.

18:16.269 --> 18:18.184
Please accept this $100 voucher

18:18.227 --> 18:21.143
for your next flight
on any other airline.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.405
Hey, are you okay?

18:22.449 --> 18:23.754
That was really scary
for all of us,

18:23.798 --> 18:25.365
so it must have been
terrifying for you.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.976
Jackpot lawyers
will not let me confirm nor deny

18:28.019 --> 18:30.021
that our CEO
jumped out of a plane,

18:30.065 --> 18:33.373
so legally I'm not allowed
to feel any emotion about it.

18:33.416 --> 18:34.983
I know all about nondisclosures.

18:35.026 --> 18:37.072
I'm a finalist
to be Tom Cruise's next wife.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.422
I'm not gonna do it,
but they fixed my teeth.

18:39.466 --> 18:40.380
But the good news is

18:40.423 --> 18:43.383
you didn't do anything,
so they can't blame you.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.080
No, but I'm still
probably gonna get fired.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.779
That dumb kid took a narc-y
video of me on the plane.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.086
That sucks.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.958
Maybe I can help.

18:54.002 --> 18:56.047
Here's the deal, kid.

18:56.091 --> 18:58.049
Delete that video
of my flight attendant friends,

18:58.093 --> 18:59.355
and I'll pretend
to be your girlfriend

18:59.399 --> 19:01.836
-for the next three months.
-I already have a girlfriend.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.272
Her name is Kelsey,
but she's a Mormon,

19:03.316 --> 19:04.578
so she doesn't have a phone.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.406
Okay.
Here's what I'm offering.

19:06.449 --> 19:08.799
One FaceTime a week,
four flirty text messages,

19:08.843 --> 19:11.976
and you can pick one of three
reasons to break up with me:

19:12.020 --> 19:13.761
I'm too jealous, I'm too clingy,

19:13.804 --> 19:15.850
or I didn't laugh enough
at Rick and Morty.

19:15.893 --> 19:17.547
Throw in one of your bras,
and you got yourself a deal.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.288
-No.
-Deal.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.813
Ah! That was amazing.

19:22.857 --> 19:25.120
-Thank you so much
for doing that. -Of course.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.426
You're the best, Ronnie.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.210
I didn't want to tell Bernard,

19:28.254 --> 19:29.864
but the only reason
I fly Jackpot

19:29.907 --> 19:31.213
is 'cause you take care of me.

19:31.257 --> 19:34.216
Oh, my God! You have no idea

19:34.260 --> 19:37.132
how bad I needed
to hear that today. Thank you.

19:42.355 --> 19:44.618
A-Artem, do not worry.
I have been doing the math,

19:44.661 --> 19:47.621
and if I buckle down
and tutor six kids a week,

19:47.664 --> 19:50.580
I will have your money in...

19:50.624 --> 19:53.496
-68 months.
-Don't worry.

19:53.540 --> 19:56.586
It's okay. I've wiped out
your debt in my book.

19:56.630 --> 19:59.372
And I will also cover
the losses for Nichole.

19:59.415 --> 20:01.243
What

20:01.287 --> 20:03.463
It's my thank you to you

20:03.506 --> 20:06.248
because I won
my first bet in weeks.

20:06.292 --> 20:09.469
You have ended my cold streak.

20:09.512 --> 20:11.471
I-I'm happy to help.

20:11.514 --> 20:14.604
Besides,
when I lost my first bet

20:14.648 --> 20:16.258
on a rigged chicken fight,

20:16.302 --> 20:18.956
I lost a lot of money
and my dinner.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.395
But my father, bless his heart,
he covered my debt.

20:22.438 --> 20:24.440
So I thought,
do the same for you.

20:24.484 --> 20:26.268
Thank you, Artem.

20:26.312 --> 20:29.358
You're not just a good gambler,
you're a good man.

20:29.402 --> 20:32.796
I'm your daddy now, Colin.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.368
Sorry you ended up with nothing.

20:39.412 --> 20:41.501
I didn't end up
with nothing, Alan.

20:41.544 --> 20:43.503
I realized my dream
of opening a bar.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.896
That's a lot more
than most people can say.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.116
I think I ended up with a lot.

20:48.159 --> 20:52.076
No, it seems like
you ended up with nothing.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.471
Good news, Bernard.
Our national nightmare is over.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.995
-Tanner deleted the video.
-Oh, thank God.

20:58.039 --> 21:01.564
Now I can go back to fighting
my real nemesis, Father Time.

21:01.608 --> 21:04.175
Ronnie, you deserve
that job with Jack.

21:04.219 --> 21:06.395
You're the hardest-working
person on our plane.

21:06.439 --> 21:07.701
You make us all look better.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.355
So the next time
an eccentric billionaire

21:09.398 --> 21:11.444
offers us
a life-changing opportunity,

21:11.487 --> 21:15.796
I promise, in that one
situation, to stand down.

21:15.839 --> 21:19.147
Today was one for the books,
my friends.

21:19.190 --> 21:22.368
To that crazy bastard,
Jack Silver.

21:22.411 --> 21:23.804
Wherever he is.

21:23.847 --> 21:27.329
Finally free, living it up,
not a care in the world.

21:27.373 --> 21:30.201
ALL:
To Jack.

21:30.245 --> 21:32.247
♪

21:40.168 --> 21:43.127
Ugh.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.303
All right.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.571

21:53.660 --> 21:55.792
You've hit the jackpot withLA to Vegas.

21:55.836 --> 21:58.317
Now here are a few more shows to check out from Fox.

21:59.796 --> 22:01.755
911. What's your emergency?

22:01.798 --> 22:04.584
MAN : I'm on Flight 46, and we're going down.

22:04.627 --> 22:07.282
Just tell my wife I'm so sorry that I cannot come home to you.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.414
Hello?

22:10.546 --> 22:13.506
This is your family.
We got you, okay?

22:15.072 --> 22:16.247
Rapid response now!

22:16.291 --> 22:19.207
-We can't save everyone.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.514
It's time we showed Gotham
who we are.
