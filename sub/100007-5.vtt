00:03.708 --> 00:05.551
MAN: This is one of the
best foods in the forest.

00:05.551 --> 00:07.028
GORDON: What is it?
MAN: Ant larvae.

00:07.028 --> 00:08.796
GORDON: That's it there?
MAN: That's it.

00:08.796 --> 00:11.199
GORDON: Okay, so it looks like
a bit of a coconut from here.

00:11.199 --> 00:14.135
MAN: You've got to
give it a good shake. Yep.

00:14.669 --> 00:16.604
GORDON: I've been
shopping for eggs before,
but not quite like this.

00:17.972 --> 00:23.311
(Bleep), ah,
they're sharp, (bleep).

00:24.312 --> 00:28.282
And it's raining with (bleep)
ants everywhere here. (bleep).

00:43.698 --> 00:47.869
This is the 4000
Island Region of the Mekong
River in southern Laos.

00:49.003 --> 00:53.040
And the Mekong is the life
blood of this incredible
landlocked country.

00:54.709 --> 00:56.811
What an amazing place.

00:57.778 --> 01:00.248
Running from north to south,

01:00.248 --> 01:03.684
the mighty Mekong
is Laos' backbone.

01:03.684 --> 01:07.488
Part highway, part
water supply and crucially
a vital source of food,

01:08.155 --> 01:10.558
which I'm told
is bloody delicious.

01:13.060 --> 01:15.329
Amazing, amazing,
amazing, amazing.

01:16.330 --> 01:20.701
But from what I've heard,
trying to get my hands on this
amazing food won't be easy.

01:21.802 --> 01:25.172
Laotians go to extreme lengths
to source their ingredients.

01:25.673 --> 01:28.276
And I'm here to
learn their secrets.

01:31.178 --> 01:35.216
My adventure begins
in the deep south, on the
banks of the Khone Falls.

01:36.684 --> 01:39.820
I'm meeting a chef who
I hope can give me the
lowdown on Laos cuisine.

01:40.821 --> 01:43.791
And after all that paddling,
I'm hoping he's laid on lunch.

01:44.392 --> 01:45.826
Good to see you.

01:45.826 --> 01:46.928
JOI: Hi, good to see you.

01:46.928 --> 01:49.163
GORDON: Likewise.
What an amazing river!

01:49.564 --> 01:51.198
JOI: Yeah, it is.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.868
GORDON: With one of
the top‐rated restaurants
in the country,

01:53.868 --> 01:56.904
Joi Ngueamboupha is
passionate about Laos food.

01:57.939 --> 02:01.876
Celebrating its unique blend
of flavors that can't be found
anywhere else in the world.

02:04.579 --> 02:08.382
First of all, an absolute
pleasure because you've helped
put Laos cuisine in the map.

02:09.250 --> 02:11.552
I'm dying to get to understand
for the Laos cuisine.

02:14.555 --> 02:15.656
GORDON: Right.

02:22.096 --> 02:23.698
GORDON: Wow,
that's incredible.

02:23.698 --> 02:25.900
What is he doing over there?
That crazy man.

02:28.369 --> 02:30.304
GORDON: I mean, not
the safest place to fish.

02:30.304 --> 02:31.872
JOI: Because very strong water?

02:31.872 --> 02:33.074
GORDON: Yes.

02:33.074 --> 02:34.609
JOI: So that the
fish more tasty.

02:34.609 --> 02:35.743
GORDON: Wow.

02:37.311 --> 02:39.480
GORDON: Wow. So by
fighting the current they get
a little bit more tastier?

02:39.480 --> 02:40.681
JOI: More tasty
and more exercise.

02:40.681 --> 02:41.882
GORDON: Wow.
More exercise?

02:41.882 --> 02:43.117
JOI: More exercise.

02:43.117 --> 02:44.552
GORDON: And so there's a big
difference between fish being

02:44.552 --> 02:46.487
caught down here than
there is over the other
side of the rapids?

02:46.487 --> 02:47.989
JOI: Yes.

02:47.989 --> 02:50.124
GORDON: It's just so
dangerous, he's almost like
on the edge of the rock.

02:51.759 --> 02:52.793
GORDON: Me?
JOI: Yeah.

02:53.160 --> 02:57.398
GORDON: It's dangerous, right?
JOI: Not really.

02:58.232 --> 03:01.302
GORDON: Not really.
Um, yeah, I beg to differ.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.905
Khone Falls are the
widest in the world.

03:06.173 --> 03:09.543
And 2.5 million gallons
of water crash over
these rocks every second.

03:13.214 --> 03:16.384
I was hoping for
lunch, but this wasn't
what I had in mind.

03:20.721 --> 03:22.423
What in the
(bleep) are we doing?

03:23.124 --> 03:24.659
Seriously?

03:24.892 --> 03:26.093
You sure this will
take my weight, Joy?

03:26.093 --> 03:28.195
JOI: Yeah, I'm sure, yeah.

03:34.869 --> 03:38.039
GORDON: (bleep)
Where are we going? Man.

03:40.441 --> 03:44.111
Local fisherman
Mr. Senchan has been
risking his life, sorry,

03:44.111 --> 03:46.580
catching these prized
Mekong fish for decades.

03:50.017 --> 03:56.157
(bleep) Joy, these fish
better taste (bleep) delicious!

03:57.491 --> 03:59.527
This is crazy.

04:00.027 --> 04:03.464
Traditional cast
net fishing has been practiced
for thousands of years.

04:03.964 --> 04:07.802
Elbow. But I've just minutes
to get the hang of it.

04:08.936 --> 04:10.371
JOI: Hand there.

04:10.371 --> 04:13.808
GORDON: Hold? Happy.
Ready? This is not a good idea.

04:19.380 --> 04:24.118
GORDON: Yes.
JOI: Oh, come on!

04:26.387 --> 04:29.924
GORDON: (bleep) Oh (bleep).

04:31.625 --> 04:35.162
I'll tell you what, they make
it look so easy but there
is nothing easy in this.

04:36.297 --> 04:38.232
That's an edgy place to fish.

04:38.232 --> 04:40.735
It's the force of that
water inches away from you.

04:40.735 --> 04:42.737
And one slip and you're gone.

04:43.304 --> 04:45.906
Joy, this time we're
going to catch something.

04:47.908 --> 04:51.178
GORDON: Yes! Here we go.
JOI: Wow.

04:57.485 --> 04:59.086
Pull it in!

04:59.453 --> 05:01.055
GORDON: Yeah, nothing.

05:01.055 --> 05:03.023
There's got to be an
easier way of catching
fish here, surely.

05:05.359 --> 05:07.495
JOI: Come on!

05:14.635 --> 05:16.504
GORDON: (bleep) nothing!

05:18.773 --> 05:20.207
GORDON: What?
JOI: Yeah, he's caught...

05:23.711 --> 05:26.380
GORDON: So you're
telling me it's not
the right time of day?

05:26.680 --> 05:28.883
Holy (bleep).

05:28.883 --> 05:31.385
(bleep), Joy,
there's no joy in this!

05:32.419 --> 05:36.056
Thankfully Mr. Senchan
takes pity on me and kindly
shares his morning catch.

05:38.025 --> 05:40.194
Oh my God.
And was that here?

05:40.928 --> 05:42.229
JOI: Yes.

05:42.229 --> 05:44.665
GORDON: Look at those beauties.
They are gorgeous.

05:44.665 --> 05:46.834
Right, let's go eat
some before we get killed!

05:47.134 --> 05:49.170
JOI: Yeah, yeah.

05:55.776 --> 05:59.013
GORDON: Now this is
a traditional way of
cooking this, right?

05:59.413 --> 06:01.115
JOI: Yes, yes.

06:01.115 --> 06:03.918
You usually in Laos people,
like every weekend with
friends we go to fishing,

06:03.918 --> 06:05.619
maybe barbecue
along the river.

06:06.387 --> 06:07.788
GORDON: And you wrap
that in a banana leaf.

06:07.788 --> 06:09.523
JOI: Yes, with
a bamboo skewer.

06:09.523 --> 06:11.892
And also inside we
stuff with lemon grass.

06:12.626 --> 06:14.495
GORDON: That
smells incredible.

06:14.728 --> 06:17.898
Before his culinary
calling, Joy spent
seven years as a monk.

06:18.532 --> 06:22.670
JOI: I learn a lot and
also in the temple I
learn a lot about food.

06:23.270 --> 06:26.240
GORDON: Wow. Do you think
that's why you wanted to
become a chef as a monk?

06:26.240 --> 06:27.641
JOI: Yes.

06:27.641 --> 06:30.444
GORDON: And still today the
monks are highly respected.

06:30.444 --> 06:33.714
JOI: Yes. In the
next few days I'm going
to cook for the temple

06:33.714 --> 06:35.583
if you would
like to help me.

06:35.583 --> 06:37.318
GORDON: Wow, you
want me to cook?

06:37.318 --> 06:39.153
JOI: Yes.
GORDON: For the monks?

06:39.153 --> 06:41.822
JOI: Yes.
GORDON: At the temple?

06:42.056 --> 06:45.059
Joy's set me a mission
to cook for the monks.

06:45.826 --> 06:49.063
They are a, it's
almost like royalty here.

06:52.566 --> 06:55.836
GORDON: The monks
at Wutcontai temple,
like monks all over Laos,

06:55.836 --> 06:58.739
rely on the generosity
of their neighbors to eat.

06:59.273 --> 07:00.875
Though money is tight,

07:00.875 --> 07:03.510
locals prepare daily
feasts for them in the hope
of receiving a blessing.

07:04.879 --> 07:07.681
(speaking in native language).

07:11.685 --> 07:13.220
Look at that.

07:13.220 --> 07:15.589
Oh yes, that's
come out beautiful.

07:16.557 --> 07:18.259
Man, that fish is so soft.

07:18.259 --> 07:19.894
I'm dying to taste that.

07:20.561 --> 07:23.364
GORDON: Cooking for such
highly esteemed guests
will be a real challenge.

07:24.498 --> 07:27.101
But Joy tells me
there's an added twist.

07:27.101 --> 07:29.737
The scary thing
for me is that it needs
to be served at 11,

07:29.737 --> 07:32.973
because after midday
they cannot eat until
the following morning.

07:33.574 --> 07:36.176
So, I've got my work cut out.

07:41.348 --> 07:43.050
That's so delicious.

07:44.852 --> 07:48.289
I've less than a week to get
to grips with Laos cuisine and
prepare a feast at the temple.

07:48.555 --> 07:53.594
I'm not saint, so to boost
my karma credit rating, I
have to make sure I nail it.

07:54.061 --> 07:55.829
That is really delicious,
thank God.

07:55.829 --> 07:58.332
Because that is
the most dangerous fish
I've ever helped catch.

08:14.448 --> 08:18.185
So, with the challenge
set, I'm hitting the river.

08:18.185 --> 08:22.156
Along the bank of the Mekong,
the rice paddies yield
all manner of surprising

08:22.156 --> 08:24.591
delicacies for the
self‐sufficient locals.

08:26.894 --> 08:31.598
So Joy's friend Utah has
brought me to meet rice farmer
Mr. Ten and his family, hello.

08:32.166 --> 08:34.068
(speaking in native language).

08:34.068 --> 08:35.436
How are you?
You good?

08:35.436 --> 08:36.704
Nice to see you. Hello.

08:36.704 --> 08:39.306
What kinds of foods are
you sourcing from here?

08:39.673 --> 08:42.076
Because I see the
river that side and the
paddy fields that side.

08:42.076 --> 08:44.111
(speaking in native language).

08:44.912 --> 08:46.347
UTAH: Frogs.
GORDON: Frogs.

08:46.347 --> 08:49.283
UTAH: Toe bites.
GORDON: Hold on,
toe bites, as in?

08:49.283 --> 08:51.952
UTAH: Toe bites, the one that
basically bite your toes.

08:51.952 --> 08:53.487
GORDON: Insects
that bite your toes?

08:53.487 --> 08:54.922
UTAH: Yes, exactly.

08:54.922 --> 08:57.091
GORDON: Wow.
UTAH: Yes, all yummy.

08:57.091 --> 08:58.559
GORDON: All yummy?
UTAH: All yummy.

08:58.559 --> 09:00.894
GORDON: Amazing.
Amazing, amazing, amazing.

09:00.894 --> 09:04.231
Let's go. Toe biters,
what size are these things?

09:04.732 --> 09:08.135
The rice fields are only
a short walk away, but
like men around the world,

09:08.135 --> 09:10.571
Mr. Ten loves to show
off his souped‐up ride.

09:11.438 --> 09:13.640
I feel like I'm on my
granddad's lawnmower with half

09:13.640 --> 09:15.409
my grandma's
washing machine in front.

09:15.909 --> 09:18.445
UTAH: Good comparison.
GORDON: What a contraption.

09:20.447 --> 09:24.485
This is his custom‐built
iron buffalo and he's
letting me take the reins.

09:25.719 --> 09:26.987
How do we start?

09:26.987 --> 09:28.589
(speaking in native language).

09:28.589 --> 09:30.724
UTAH: Cycling. Oh,
there's a string for the speed.

09:31.358 --> 09:33.260
GORDON: Okay, so that's
the acceleration pedal?

09:33.260 --> 09:34.895
UTAH: That's right, yeah.
Acceleration pedal.

09:34.895 --> 09:36.764
GORDON: That's slow
and that's fast?

09:36.764 --> 09:38.232
(speaking in native language).

09:38.232 --> 09:40.334
UTAH: You pull this up
first, so after this.

09:40.334 --> 09:43.103
GORDON: Oh okay, so
that's like the handbrake
and this is the gear.

09:43.103 --> 09:44.805
UTAH: Exactly.
GORDON: And seatbelts?

09:44.805 --> 09:47.374
(speaking in native language).

09:47.374 --> 09:50.210
GORDON: No, I'm joking.
We ready?

09:50.744 --> 09:52.079
Let's go.

09:54.915 --> 09:56.550
(engine starts)

09:57.351 --> 09:59.286
Let's go, captain.

09:59.887 --> 10:02.723
Kids, buffaloes,
frogs, get out the way!

10:02.723 --> 10:04.324
UTAH: Oh my God.
Oh my God!

10:04.324 --> 10:05.626
GORDON: (bleep).

10:05.626 --> 10:06.860
(screams)

10:13.067 --> 10:14.668
UTAH: Slowly, slowly, slowly!

10:14.668 --> 10:16.703
GORDON: (bleep).

10:17.571 --> 10:19.173
This may not be
the safest ride,

10:19.173 --> 10:21.875
but I definitely feel
safer than the people
walking in front of me.

10:22.342 --> 10:24.311
Oh jeez.

10:25.512 --> 10:27.548
UTAH: Oh man. Oh man.

10:28.015 --> 10:29.716
GORDON: Hello! (bleep).

10:30.551 --> 10:32.820
UTAH: Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh.

10:32.820 --> 10:36.256
Stop, stop. Stop, stop,
go around. Stop, stop!

10:38.092 --> 10:41.161
GORDON: (Bleep), this
thing's a death trap.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.165
UTAH: Oh man.
GORDON: Man.

10:46.266 --> 10:49.770
On my quest to discover
the best local food to
serve at a feast for monks,

10:49.770 --> 10:54.108
Mr. Ten leads me to
a field that he assures me
is full of Laos delicacies.

10:56.143 --> 10:57.411
(speaking in native language).

10:57.411 --> 10:59.346
UTAH: He's looking
for toe biters.

10:59.346 --> 11:00.881
GORDON: Life here is tough.

11:00.881 --> 11:03.283
Some families
survive on just $5 a day.

11:04.651 --> 11:07.154
So foraging for insects
provide much needed protein,

11:07.154 --> 11:09.756
flavor and if you're
not careful, flesh wounds.

11:10.924 --> 11:13.026
Here's one,
here's one here! (bleep)

11:14.128 --> 11:15.429
UTAH: Oh, careful
he's going to bite you!

11:15.429 --> 11:18.532
GORDON: (Bleep), they're
sharp, those things.

11:18.866 --> 11:21.768
Can you get him?

11:24.438 --> 11:26.773
Here's one here.

11:27.741 --> 11:30.043
Look at that,
the size of them.

11:30.043 --> 11:32.379
And what do they do?
Boil them, grill them?

11:32.379 --> 11:35.182
(speaking in native language).

11:35.182 --> 11:37.718
UTAH: Barbecue first and
then make a dipping sauce.

11:38.819 --> 11:40.554
GORDON: Hey, another one.

11:40.554 --> 11:42.222
UTAH: Oh, you're good.

11:42.422 --> 11:45.292
GORDON: (Bleep),
they're like large beetles.

11:46.193 --> 11:47.361
UTAH: Oh, man!

11:47.361 --> 11:49.663
GORDON: What was that?
What was that?

11:49.663 --> 11:51.031
UTAH: A beetle.

11:53.333 --> 11:55.502
GORDON: Man, they're fast,
these little bugs are.

11:55.869 --> 11:57.938
Ah, (bleep)!

12:02.843 --> 12:04.645
Frog! Mr. Ten!

12:04.945 --> 12:08.148
(speaking in native language).

12:08.916 --> 12:10.784
GORDON: Wow.
Bloody hell.

12:11.885 --> 12:13.987
Look at him, huh,
he's beautiful.

12:14.755 --> 12:16.290
Is he too small to eat?

12:16.290 --> 12:17.925
(speaking in native language).

12:17.925 --> 12:19.927
UTAH: Too small?

12:24.097 --> 12:26.533
GORDON: While Mr. Ten
takes the toe biters
back to the kitchen...

12:26.533 --> 12:27.935
Me in that one?

12:27.935 --> 12:29.937
UTAH: Yes.
GORDON: Oh man, really?

12:29.937 --> 12:32.105
His sons take me
out on the river.

12:32.806 --> 12:36.143
Now at 210 pounds I just
hope I don't sink this thing.

12:37.211 --> 12:39.680
Woo, (bleep).

12:44.818 --> 12:47.821
The Mekong is the
second most bio‐diverse
river in the world.

12:48.655 --> 12:52.726
It's full of fish that I
failed to net, but it's also
filled with delicious snails.

12:53.594 --> 12:56.797
Finally, prey I'm
fast enough to catch!

12:59.666 --> 13:01.235
This place is beautiful.

13:01.235 --> 13:02.703
So, where are they?

13:07.174 --> 13:08.976
GORDON: Underneath the weeds?
UTAH: Underneath, yeah.

13:08.976 --> 13:11.211
GORDON: Okay, great. Let's go!
UTAH: I'm not going!

13:12.079 --> 13:13.647
GORDON: You're not going?
UTAH: No, I'm staying here.

13:13.647 --> 13:16.183
GORDON: Why?
UTAH: Just in case
I have to rescue you.

13:16.183 --> 13:17.317
GORDON: In case
you have to what?

13:17.317 --> 13:19.353
UTAH: Rescue you!
GORDON: Rescue me?

13:19.620 --> 13:21.955
UTAH: Yes.
GORDON: Woo, that's fresh.

13:21.955 --> 13:24.558
UTAH: Careful.
GORDON: Aye‐aye‐aye‐aye‐aye.

13:24.558 --> 13:27.194
(bleep).

13:33.400 --> 13:35.769
(bleep).
It's a strong current.

13:43.377 --> 13:45.112
(bleep).

13:49.449 --> 13:54.087
In these strong currents I
look less like Michael Phelps
and more like Michael Palin.

13:57.624 --> 13:59.192
It's a lot harder
than you think, right?

13:59.192 --> 14:01.428
UTAH: It is, it is.

14:03.196 --> 14:06.433
GORDON: It's not (bleep)
easy to put food on the
table in this country.

14:10.804 --> 14:12.139
Caught one!

14:12.139 --> 14:13.840
UTAH: Oh, well done.

14:16.443 --> 14:17.978
GORDON: Look at those.

14:17.978 --> 14:20.314
How are you getting
so many in one hand?

14:21.114 --> 14:22.215
Further in front.

14:22.215 --> 14:23.984
UTAH: Further.

14:29.856 --> 14:31.725
GORDON: Got another one.

14:31.725 --> 14:33.260
UTAH: Oh, what's that?
Is it a clam?

14:33.560 --> 14:35.162
GORDON: It looks like a clam.

14:35.162 --> 14:36.730
UTAH: A clam, yeah.
Wow, well done.

14:36.730 --> 14:38.432
GORDON: This is going to
take me all bloody day!

14:38.432 --> 14:40.434
I mean, just look at
that, they're small.

14:41.401 --> 14:42.969
Let's just
hope they're tasty.

14:43.303 --> 14:47.874
I've done over 500 dives,
that dive was one of
the most difficult because

14:47.874 --> 14:51.211
you can't dive in a meter and
a half of water when you've
got a current that strong.

14:55.115 --> 14:58.285
After a hard day's graft,
Mr. Ten and his family
teach me how they cook

14:58.285 --> 15:01.121
toe biters using
traditional bamboo skewers.

15:02.923 --> 15:04.891
And then through.

15:05.792 --> 15:07.728
How many times a week
would you eat these?

15:07.961 --> 15:09.429
(speaking in native language).

15:09.429 --> 15:10.597
Once a week?

15:10.597 --> 15:11.965
UTAH: Once a week, yeah.

15:11.965 --> 15:13.300
GORDON: So it's
regarded as a delicacy?

15:13.300 --> 15:16.036
UTAH: Yes. Turn it up.

15:16.536 --> 15:18.672
GORDON: So you grill
them over the charcoal?

15:18.672 --> 15:20.807
UTAH: Yes.
GORDON: Amazing.

15:21.942 --> 15:23.543
UTAH: Remove the wing.
GORDON: Right.

15:23.543 --> 15:26.313
Ah.

15:28.949 --> 15:31.952
Ah. Just that? Wow.

15:35.088 --> 15:38.925
(Bleep), here we go.

15:40.127 --> 15:42.796
UTAH: Crunchy, chewy.

15:46.233 --> 15:50.237
GORDON: Wow. That actually
tastes almost like a,

15:51.705 --> 15:54.408
sort of the inside
of a lobster carcass.

15:54.408 --> 15:58.011
It's very sweet.
That's delicious.
Really good.

15:59.112 --> 16:02.115
They don't look
appetizing, but my God,
get inside that head,

16:02.783 --> 16:05.986
it's like a sort of
cross between a sweet
lobster and a crab meat.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.855
And yeah, packed with protein.

16:08.855 --> 16:10.791
Big surprise.
Amazing. Snails.

16:14.294 --> 16:16.596
Ah, look, he's got one there.

16:16.596 --> 16:18.398
Thank you. Amazing.

16:24.304 --> 16:26.573
GORDON: Roll that up tight.

16:26.573 --> 16:28.341
It's like a snail
lettuce roll.

16:28.809 --> 16:32.946
UTAH: Snail roll,
yeah. How's it?

16:36.082 --> 16:39.519
MR TEN: Okay?
GORDON: It's delicious.
Better than okay.

16:40.253 --> 16:43.590
(speaking in native language).

16:44.357 --> 16:46.259
These snails are very meaty.

16:46.259 --> 16:51.231
So not only do we harvest the
most amazing rice, but we've
got this bounty of ingredients

16:51.231 --> 16:54.367
that is expensive protein,
because they taste delicious.

16:56.670 --> 16:59.339
The effort it takes
to create just one
meal here is humbling.

17:00.407 --> 17:04.544
At home we have snails
with garlic butter, fancy
tongs and stupid shells.

17:05.512 --> 17:07.214
This is delicious.

17:07.581 --> 17:09.850
I'd love to serve some of
these critters to the monks,

17:10.116 --> 17:12.052
but I'd be here all
week catching them.

17:12.052 --> 17:14.187
And there just isn't time.

17:25.265 --> 17:27.934
It's just 48 hours
into the Monk's banquet,

17:27.934 --> 17:31.071
and I've still
got a lot to learn.

17:31.338 --> 17:33.740
So, I'm heading to a remote
village where I've heard

17:33.740 --> 17:37.043
there's a forest that
packs a punch of flavors.

17:37.043 --> 17:38.712
I was given
two travel options.

17:38.712 --> 17:41.014
I drive down a dirt
road that would take hours,

17:41.014 --> 17:43.049
or a short cut.

17:44.317 --> 17:47.354
This is the
(bleep) short cut.

17:51.925 --> 17:52.959
Mick.

17:52.959 --> 17:54.227
MICK: Hey!
GORDON: Good morning.

17:54.227 --> 17:55.595
MICK: Great to meet you.
GORDON: Likewise,
but good to see you.

17:55.595 --> 17:57.697
MICK: Excellent yeah.
GORDON: What an amazing place.

17:57.697 --> 18:00.667
MICK: It really is.
GORDON: Man!

18:02.602 --> 18:04.371
Australian adventurer,
Mick O'Shea,

18:04.371 --> 18:06.406
has been exploring
this region for decades.

18:08.141 --> 18:10.110
He's promised to get
me there in one piece.

18:10.610 --> 18:11.978
How difficult is
that going to be?

18:11.978 --> 18:13.446
MICK: There's certainly
some challenges.

18:13.446 --> 18:15.148
We've got some very
strong whirl‐pools.

18:15.148 --> 18:16.316
GORDON: Right.

18:16.316 --> 18:17.884
MICK: You don't
want to swim here.

18:17.884 --> 18:19.519
GORDON: (bleep).

18:20.320 --> 18:23.490
Mick tells me the
locals call these
falls the spirit trap.

18:23.857 --> 18:26.493
After the demons
believed to be caught
beneath these rapids.

18:26.893 --> 18:28.962
Ophf. Man I have
it fast down there.

18:28.962 --> 18:31.765
And, I'm beginning
to understand why, (bleep).

18:33.567 --> 18:35.769
MICK: Now generally we want
to stay in the middle, okay.

18:35.769 --> 18:38.305
Because, along the edge
the water's very fast.

18:38.305 --> 18:40.073
You don't really want to
get scraped along the rocks.

18:41.074 --> 18:43.944
There's whirl‐pools
downstream, 200 meters
down there, they,

18:43.944 --> 18:46.513
they can suck one, someone
down for quite a few seconds.

18:46.513 --> 18:48.582
GORDON: Right, right.

18:49.115 --> 18:51.918
MICK: If that happens,
you've really just got to
focus on holding your breath.

18:51.918 --> 18:53.153
GORDON: Right.

18:53.153 --> 18:55.221
MICK: The, the currents are so
strong that swimming against

18:55.221 --> 18:57.157
any sort of current
here it's a losing battle.

18:57.157 --> 18:58.525
How are you
feeling about this?

18:58.525 --> 19:00.026
GORDON: Yeah, a
little bit nervous.

19:00.026 --> 19:01.928
MICK: If your adrenaline
wasn't pumping now,
I'd be a bit worried.

19:01.928 --> 19:03.697
I'd probably wouldn't
want you going down there.

19:03.697 --> 19:05.498
Because this is a
serious undertaking.

19:05.498 --> 19:07.233
GORDON: Yep.

19:08.868 --> 19:10.904
The things I do for food.

19:11.304 --> 19:12.839
MICK: Alright, let's do it.

19:12.839 --> 19:17.043
GORDON: (Bleep), thank you.
A bit nervous.

19:17.744 --> 19:19.045
MICK: Are you ready Gordon?

19:19.045 --> 19:22.849
GORDON: Yes sir.
MICK: On three.
One! Two! Three!

19:30.890 --> 19:32.092
MICK: Are you ready, Gordon?

19:32.092 --> 19:33.293
GORDON: Yes, sir.

19:33.293 --> 19:35.195
MICK: On three.
One! Two! Three!

19:35.195 --> 19:37.998
Lean over, lean over left.
Lean left, lean left.

19:37.998 --> 19:39.432
That's good.
Keep leaning left.

19:39.432 --> 19:40.967
But, keep leaning left.

19:40.967 --> 19:43.269
GORDON: When Mick
said, "Do you want to take
a short cut to the forest",

19:43.269 --> 19:46.039
I didn't realize that meant
risking life and limb.

19:46.573 --> 19:48.441
MICK: Okay, straighten
up, straighten up.

19:48.441 --> 19:50.610
Straighten up, back on
the left, back on the left.

19:50.610 --> 19:51.745
Paddle forward.

19:51.745 --> 19:52.812
Keep that angle.

19:52.812 --> 19:54.347
Keep more to the left.

19:54.347 --> 19:56.916
GORDON: But, given the
extremes I've experienced
so far in this country,

19:56.916 --> 19:58.718
I shouldn't have been surprised.

19:58.718 --> 20:01.521
MICK: Excellent.
Paddle straight.

20:03.256 --> 20:07.961
Straighten up!
Straighten up!
More to the left.

20:08.895 --> 20:12.265
GORDON: (Bleep), alright.
MICK: Nailed it.

20:13.099 --> 20:15.969
GORDON: (Bleep).
MICK: Alright.

20:16.336 --> 20:18.004
GORDON: Honestly,
that was cool hey.

20:18.004 --> 20:20.373
MICK: That was insane.
GORDON: Whoa!

20:20.373 --> 20:22.108
MICK: You done a great
job there Gordon.

20:22.108 --> 20:24.411
GORDON: Man, (bleep).

20:24.844 --> 20:25.945
MICK: Well done, mate.

20:25.945 --> 20:27.280
GORDON: Oh boy, (bleep)!

20:27.280 --> 20:28.581
MICK: Great work, hey!

20:28.581 --> 20:30.316
GORDON: That was insane.

20:30.316 --> 20:34.587
Magical, brilliant,
but it's tough in there.

20:35.255 --> 20:37.857
I'm just hoping that
this village, you know,

20:37.857 --> 20:39.492
is going to
deliver some magic.

20:39.492 --> 20:42.295
Because that was a
journey and a half.

20:44.130 --> 20:48.268
Back on dry land, it's into
the Ban Han Cong Forest for
a lesson on Laos flavors.

20:49.035 --> 20:51.471
Oh man, this is deep now.

20:52.138 --> 20:56.042
But of course, adrenaline
junkie, Mick, insists on
another dodgy short cut.

20:57.243 --> 20:58.912
It's not going to
take you and I.

20:58.912 --> 21:01.514
MICK: Exactly. I think
we spread, space ourselves out.

21:01.514 --> 21:03.550
GORDON: (Bleep),
I mean, really?

21:05.285 --> 21:07.887
MICK: Just watch that
next bit Gordon, it's
like a little bit wobbly.

21:09.723 --> 21:12.625
GORDON: (Bleep), what
is wrong with you?

21:17.997 --> 21:20.166
MICK: Here we are.
This is, this is the village.

21:20.166 --> 21:21.968
GORDON: We're here?
MICK: Yep.

21:23.236 --> 21:27.540
GORDON: People in the isolated
village of Han Cong Noi,
rely on the Forest to survive.

21:28.108 --> 21:29.342
MICK: Hey, Mr. Muang.

21:29.342 --> 21:30.643
(speaking in native language).

21:30.643 --> 21:32.378
MICK: How are you?
How are you? Oh hang on.

21:32.378 --> 21:36.216
GORDON: Mr. Muang is Laos
answer to Daniel Boone.

21:36.649 --> 21:39.986
I'm hoping his knowledge
of forest flavors
can inspire a winning menu

21:39.986 --> 21:41.721
for the discerning Monks.

21:42.155 --> 21:43.857
You have the most
amazing garden.

21:43.857 --> 21:47.026
It's almost like this
perfect market,
stroke, supermarket.

21:47.026 --> 21:49.162
MICK: Wait till you
see Mr. Muang out
in the forest man.

21:49.162 --> 21:50.296
He's amazing.

21:50.296 --> 21:51.865
(speaking in native language).

21:51.865 --> 21:53.767
GORDON: That's incredible.

21:54.734 --> 21:57.704
It is beautiful in here.
Really beautiful.

22:08.548 --> 22:10.683
GORDON: Looks like a bay leaf.
MICK: It does.

22:12.452 --> 22:13.520
GORDON: That's bitter,
isn't it?

22:13.520 --> 22:15.054
MICK: Mm, it is, it is.

22:15.054 --> 22:18.057
A lot of ingredients in
Laos food, which, on their
own, you wouldn't enjoy.

22:18.057 --> 22:19.426
GORDON: No.

22:19.426 --> 22:21.262
MICK: But by balancing
them with other flavors
it really changes it.

22:21.262 --> 22:22.630
GORDON: Yeah.
That's incredible.

22:22.630 --> 22:24.331
Those leaves, yeah,
quite juicy inside.

22:24.331 --> 22:26.967
But very sour.
Yeah, pretty remarkable.

22:28.170 --> 22:29.338
What's that?

22:29.338 --> 22:30.706
MICK: That's rohtang.

22:30.706 --> 22:32.887
It's covered in
horrific thorns.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.722
You've got to be
really careful working
with this stuff.

22:34.722 --> 22:37.058
It's quite a fibrous,
sweet, flesh underneath.

22:37.725 --> 22:39.393
GORDON: So we're eating
the center of it?

22:39.393 --> 22:42.296
MICK: Yes, exactly.
GORDON: Bloody hell. Thank you.

22:42.296 --> 22:44.598
MICK: A bit off,
that's it. Yep.

22:45.966 --> 22:47.535
GORDON: It's almost
like a heart of palm.

22:47.535 --> 22:50.037
MICK: Exactly, that's
basically what it is.

22:50.037 --> 22:52.973
GORDON: In Europe we forage
for mushrooms, vegetables.

22:53.874 --> 22:56.377
This is taking foraging
to a completely new level.

22:56.377 --> 22:59.013
I mean, every 2 or 3 meters
there's something different.

22:59.413 --> 23:01.816
A leaf, a flower.

23:01.816 --> 23:06.153
It is like a garden of
Eden, because everything you
touch, pick, you can eat.

23:07.722 --> 23:09.857
What's the next aisle.

23:09.857 --> 23:11.392
MICK: Ah, you're going
to like this Gordon.

23:11.392 --> 23:14.462
This is one of the
best foods in the forest.

23:14.662 --> 23:16.063
Ant larvae.

23:16.063 --> 23:18.532
GORDON: Ants larvae?
MICK: Yep, yep, yep.

23:18.532 --> 23:20.267
They actually have
a citrus flavor.

23:20.267 --> 23:22.937
So, I'll see, you know,
it's a bit like having,
like, lemon juice

23:22.937 --> 23:24.939
or lime juice
sprinkled over protein.

23:26.307 --> 23:27.508
GORDON: But, where are they?

23:27.508 --> 23:29.110
MICK: They're actually
up in the trees.

23:29.110 --> 23:32.446
These ants, like they sew
the leaves together and
make a nest in the trees.

23:32.446 --> 23:33.814
GORDON: Wow.

23:33.814 --> 23:35.916
(speaking in native language).

23:35.916 --> 23:38.686
MICK: Alright, he's asked
if you can give him a hand.

23:39.687 --> 23:41.355
So, it's definitely
a two‐man job.

23:41.355 --> 23:44.158
That piece of bamboo is
probably like 10 meters long.

23:48.529 --> 23:49.630
Come on Gordi.

23:49.630 --> 23:51.532
GORDON: That's it there.
MICK: That's it.

23:51.532 --> 23:52.767
GORDON: I can release it?

23:52.767 --> 23:54.668
MICK: Get under it.
You've got to give
it a good shake.

23:54.668 --> 23:56.504
GORDON: Oh, it's like shaking
the ants into the basket.

23:56.504 --> 23:58.873
We want to take the best out.

23:59.907 --> 24:01.142
MICK: That's right.

24:01.142 --> 24:03.711
GORDON: (Bleep).
MAN: Yep.

24:04.512 --> 24:06.013
GORDON: (Bleep)!

24:09.550 --> 24:11.786
it's raining with
(bleep) ants everywhere here.

24:12.419 --> 24:13.821
(laughs).

24:13.821 --> 24:15.990
GORDON: (bleep), ugh!
(bleep)!

24:18.259 --> 24:19.994
MICK: Well, the thing
with these ants, right,

24:19.994 --> 24:22.830
is that when they're
grumpy they excrete acid,
so they bite your skin

24:22.830 --> 24:25.866
and then they squirt
the equivalent of
lime juice into it.

24:26.567 --> 24:31.005
GORDON: (Bleep), ugh!
They're sharp.

24:34.208 --> 24:37.411
(Bleep), watch out.

24:37.912 --> 24:39.847
My eggs! My eggs!
Don't break my eggs.

24:39.847 --> 24:41.448
MICK: Oh no, no,
it's alright.

24:41.448 --> 24:44.318
GORDON: (Bleep). I've been
shopping for eggs before,

24:44.618 --> 24:46.620
but not quite like this.

24:48.856 --> 24:52.393
I'm constantly impressed by
the lengths these Laotians
will go to for food.

24:53.127 --> 24:55.362
Risking a hail storm of
aggressive fighting ants,

24:55.362 --> 24:57.998
just to add a little citrus
flavor to their foods.

24:58.532 --> 25:00.201
That's wild.

25:00.201 --> 25:01.569
What an amazing
little kitchen this is.

25:01.569 --> 25:02.670
MICK: Isn't it?

25:02.670 --> 25:04.205
(speaking in native language).

25:04.471 --> 25:06.507
GORDON: Mr. Muang's daughter's
show me how these ants

25:06.507 --> 25:08.609
spice up a Tom
kha phak soup.

25:09.176 --> 25:11.445
And face the question every
chef asks in the kitchen.

25:12.079 --> 25:13.614
Can I help?

25:16.150 --> 25:20.721
MICK: In the pestle
there she's got,
chili, lime, and salt.

25:21.889 --> 25:23.824
GORDON: What an amazing
kitchen you have here.

25:23.824 --> 25:26.126
And any chance we can turn
the air‐condition on? (Bleep).

25:27.928 --> 25:29.897
MICK: I don't even
think they'd know what
you're talking about.

25:31.131 --> 25:33.567
GORDON: Electricity arrived in
this region just 10 years ago.

25:34.602 --> 25:37.972
But most people still use
traditional charcoal stoves
which have two settings.

25:38.873 --> 25:40.574
Hot and (bleep) hot.

25:41.408 --> 25:43.244
And so, they are
the, that's the ants?

25:43.477 --> 25:46.714
MICK: That's your annex, yeah,
yeah, mixed in with the ants.

25:47.648 --> 25:50.517
GORDON: Wow. They're delicious.
They look like little maggots.

25:51.252 --> 25:52.887
MICK: They pretty much are.

25:52.887 --> 25:55.155
GORDON: So, we're going to
finish the soup with the ants.

25:55.589 --> 25:57.291
(speaking in native language).

25:57.291 --> 25:58.559
MICK: Yes, that's right.

25:58.559 --> 26:00.661
A bunch of those herbs that
we've collected in the forest.

26:00.661 --> 26:02.263
A bunch of them are
in that soup already.

26:02.263 --> 26:04.031
GORDON: That's incredible.

26:04.899 --> 26:06.834
(speaking in native language).

26:06.834 --> 26:09.603
MICK: Ah, so we've got
coriander and spring
onions in there.

26:09.937 --> 26:12.172
So, put it all in she said.

26:12.172 --> 26:15.776
GORDON: Ants! I mean,
they had this citrus flavor of

26:15.776 --> 26:20.414
a, almost like little tiny
particles of a lime and a lemon.

26:21.448 --> 26:24.018
And they were finishing
the soup with that.

26:24.852 --> 26:26.654
I think It's delicious.
Delicious.

26:26.654 --> 26:31.392
Had this zesty, sort of, you
know, freshness to the soup.

26:31.892 --> 26:32.927
Really good.

26:32.927 --> 26:35.796
And do the men
cook in the village?

26:35.796 --> 26:37.131
(speaking in native language).

26:37.131 --> 26:41.085
MICK: In this village
only the girls cook.

26:46.330 --> 26:47.999
GORDON: Trust me
this is hard work.

26:49.801 --> 26:51.302
GORDON: I'm a Cook.

26:52.203 --> 26:53.871
(laughs).

26:58.676 --> 27:00.178
Taste buds are on fire.

27:00.178 --> 27:04.215
I think I'm starting
to lay those, those
foundations of Laos food.

27:05.783 --> 27:07.185
The finishing of the herbs.

27:07.185 --> 27:10.621
The chili's, it's sour.

27:10.888 --> 27:13.224
A touch of sweetness
in there as well.

27:13.224 --> 27:17.128
If you told me a week ago
I'd be making Ant Soup, I'd
have said, "You're crazy".

27:17.862 --> 27:22.100
But it will make a great
addition to the menu for the
Monks in a couple of days' time.

27:36.080 --> 27:40.651
After surviving cast net
fishing, extreme rapids, toe
biters, and stinging ants,

27:41.185 --> 27:44.789
today I'm embracing
the Laotian saying,
"Please don't rush".

27:45.623 --> 27:48.659
So, with that in mind,
I'm heading to Don Tan Island

27:48.893 --> 27:51.863
to sample a local
liquor known as Lao‐Lao.

27:52.363 --> 27:54.465
Wow, look at those?

27:54.465 --> 27:55.967
They're chilling out.

27:55.967 --> 27:57.235
They're on holiday.

27:57.235 --> 28:00.371
Cafe owner Nang, is taking me
to meet a local whisky maker.

28:00.738 --> 28:02.240
She has two
important jobs today.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.108
Translator and drinking buddy.

28:05.076 --> 28:07.211
We know this moonshine
is super strong, right?

28:07.211 --> 28:10.481
NANG: Yeah.
GORDON: Okay. So, not to
be drunk during the day.

28:11.415 --> 28:12.950
A little sip in
the evening, right?

28:12.950 --> 28:15.453
NANG: Local people are
here every morning. 7:00 a. m.

28:15.820 --> 28:17.688
Like, one shot.
Two shot.

28:17.688 --> 28:18.890
(laughs).

28:18.890 --> 28:20.191
GORDON: 7:00 a. m.?
NANG: Yeah.

28:20.191 --> 28:21.359
GORDON: Oh dear.
NANG: For breakfast.

28:37.608 --> 28:40.411
GORDON: Work hard. Be happy.
And drink moonshine.

28:41.078 --> 28:44.515
NANG: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Thank you, Gordon.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.652
GORDON: Where is the man?
NANG: Just here.

28:48.953 --> 28:50.254
(speaking in native language).

28:50.254 --> 28:52.089
NANG: This is Mister Sin,
the Moonshine man.

28:52.089 --> 28:53.658
GORDON: Mr. Sin.
Nice to see you.

28:53.658 --> 28:57.161
NANG: This is Gordon.
He's from London.

28:58.229 --> 29:00.431
GORDON: How long has he
been making Moonshine?

29:00.431 --> 29:02.533
(speaking in native language).

29:02.533 --> 29:04.802
NANG: More than
20 year he said.

29:05.069 --> 29:06.404
GORDON: 20 years. Wow!

29:06.404 --> 29:08.110
But look at that
coming through.

29:08.110 --> 29:08.602
NANG: Yeah.

29:08.602 --> 29:12.546
GORDON: I'd been warned,
this local hooch can top
out at around 120 proof.

29:12.947 --> 29:18.845
So... Oof, it
smells very strong.

29:18.944 --> 29:21.012
Given how extreme everything
I've experienced in Laos is,

29:21.012 --> 29:24.416
I hope this won't
make me blind. Ready?

29:25.884 --> 29:27.252
NANG: Yeah, try it.

29:37.295 --> 29:39.999
GORDON: Oof, it
smells very strong.

29:40.336 --> 29:43.840
So far, I've risked life
and limb on my culinary
adventure in Laos.

29:44.641 --> 29:49.045
But now, I risk my reputation
as a proud Scotsman, and
sample some local rice whisky.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.282
This is what I was born for.

29:52.615 --> 29:54.451
Cheers! Ready?

29:55.151 --> 30:01.124
NANG: Yeah, try it.
Oh, me? Okay.

30:02.292 --> 30:06.129
GORDON: (bleep). (bleep)
NANG: Ah!

30:08.932 --> 30:10.567
(coughs).

30:10.567 --> 30:12.135
Are you trying to kill me?

30:12.135 --> 30:13.903
(coughs).

30:16.206 --> 30:17.774
NANG: This one is the...

30:18.108 --> 30:19.843
GORDON: My lips are numb.

30:19.843 --> 30:21.811
(speaking in native language).

30:23.246 --> 30:24.514
Forget the monks.

30:24.514 --> 30:27.016
It's almost forced me
into a vow of silence.

30:28.051 --> 30:30.687
Imported liquor is
far too expensive for
most Laotian people.

30:31.421 --> 30:35.291
So, they get their hard
stuff from Mr. Sing, Laos
answer to Jack Daniels.

30:37.193 --> 30:38.661
Apologize about
the white legs.

30:38.661 --> 30:41.064
We don't get much
sunshine in Scotland.

30:41.831 --> 30:45.802
Only slightly whiter than
my legs, the sticky rice
has a high starch content,

30:45.802 --> 30:47.904
the perfect base
for whisky.

30:47.904 --> 30:49.639
Onto the table.

30:50.340 --> 30:54.244
After it's steamed and washed,
yeast is added, and it's
fermented for several days.

30:56.613 --> 31:00.016
If I was to make
Moonshine like this in
the Highlands of Scotland,

31:00.016 --> 31:01.818
you'd get
me put into prison.

31:01.818 --> 31:04.454
(speaking in native language).

31:04.687 --> 31:08.024
(shouting in native language).

31:08.024 --> 31:11.194
GORDON: Whose that shouting?

31:12.028 --> 31:14.764
NANG: He come to buy the
Laos whisky, the Moonshine.

31:14.764 --> 31:15.999
GORDON: He wants Moonshine?

31:15.999 --> 31:17.233
NANG: Hello, I have some.

31:17.233 --> 31:18.501
GORDON: You got some ready?

31:18.501 --> 31:20.036
That's the Moonshine in here?

31:20.036 --> 31:21.471
(speaking in native language).

31:21.471 --> 31:22.839
How much?

31:22.839 --> 31:26.109
NANG: 50,000 kip,
it's like $6.

31:26.442 --> 31:30.747
GORDON: $6. As well
as making the Moonshine,

31:31.247 --> 31:34.684
Mr. Sing appears to run the
local Drive‐through, hello Sir.

31:35.218 --> 31:37.387
Brewed by the finest.

31:37.387 --> 31:38.555
Good to see you.

31:38.555 --> 31:39.889
Nice to see you.

31:39.889 --> 31:41.791
A little taste?
A little sample?

31:44.260 --> 31:45.895
(speaking in native language).

31:47.363 --> 31:49.465
NANG: Very good
he say. Very good.

31:49.465 --> 31:51.467
GORDON: 50,000 kip. Enjoy.

31:52.168 --> 31:53.269
(speaking in native language).

31:53.269 --> 31:55.171
Take care.

31:55.738 --> 31:57.941
And just when you
thought things couldn't
get any more bonkers!

31:59.509 --> 32:00.610
What is that?

32:00.610 --> 32:03.046
NANG: That is
gecko and a herb.

32:03.546 --> 32:05.248
GORDON: You marinated
the geckoes in whisky?

32:05.248 --> 32:07.450
NANG: My friend make it.

32:08.117 --> 32:12.922
GORDON: No! No‐oh‐oh!
No‐oh‐hoh!

32:14.023 --> 32:16.593
Those poor bastards. Pouf!

32:17.827 --> 32:19.762
I put vanilla in my spirits.

32:19.762 --> 32:21.364
You put gecko's.

32:23.700 --> 32:27.070
NANG: You can try.

32:35.178 --> 32:36.679
Yeah, very good.

32:36.679 --> 32:38.448
GORDON: That actually
tastes better.

32:38.448 --> 32:39.882
Yeah, no, it's good.

32:39.882 --> 32:41.818
NANG: Eat more.
GORDON: It's very sweet.

32:41.818 --> 32:45.221
NANG: Yeah, come from
the herb and we make some
special herb this one,

32:45.221 --> 32:46.656
but it's secret.

32:46.656 --> 32:48.491
GORDON: Secret herbs.
NANG: Secret.

32:48.491 --> 32:51.427
GORDON: With geckoes, inside.
But the flavor is extraordinary.

32:51.427 --> 32:53.830
NANG: Uh hum.
GORDON: Mmm. Mr. Sing,
thank you.

32:54.631 --> 32:56.432
You are a true legend.

32:59.135 --> 33:00.970
NANG: Yeah, it's nice.

33:00.970 --> 33:02.605
GORDON: Thank you.
Man, those poor gecko's.

33:02.605 --> 33:05.541
How can you do that to them?
They are our pets in England.

33:05.541 --> 33:07.176
NANG: Oh uh!
GORDON: Oh uh!

33:13.049 --> 33:15.451
GORDON: I'm not sure
serving paint stripper
to the Monks tomorrow

33:15.451 --> 33:17.120
will earn me good karma.

33:17.120 --> 33:21.958
But, if I burn off
the alcohol, I reckon it will
make a heavenly banana flambé.

33:38.041 --> 33:39.242
Now that's a sunrise.

33:39.242 --> 33:40.877
JOI: Yeah, well
it's beautiful.

33:40.877 --> 33:42.312
GORDON: That is beautiful.

33:42.312 --> 33:44.247
It switches the light on,
on the Mekong doesn't it?

33:44.247 --> 33:46.015
It lights it up.

33:46.015 --> 33:50.186
It's Feast Day and I'm back
with Chef Joi, and in Laos the
early bird catches the worm.

33:51.120 --> 33:54.257
Then probably
puts it in whisky.

33:55.058 --> 33:57.260
The pressures on to
get everything bought,
cooked, served.

33:57.260 --> 33:58.494
JOI: Yeah.

33:58.494 --> 34:00.063
GORDON: We want to have
some happy monks today.

34:00.063 --> 34:01.331
JOI: Yeah, yeah.

34:01.331 --> 34:02.965
GORDON: We need fish.

34:02.965 --> 34:05.168
And because the monks
have to eat early, before my
kids are usually out of bed,

34:05.168 --> 34:07.503
Joi decides the only
option is to buy it.

34:08.171 --> 34:10.039
Amazing. Look at that.

34:10.606 --> 34:12.375
I mean that is
literally on the river bank.

34:15.645 --> 34:16.813
These two are
beautiful, right?

34:16.813 --> 34:19.182
JOI: Yeah, this one, catfish.
GORDON: They look great.

34:19.449 --> 34:21.117
JOI: Yeah.
GORDON: Look at
the colors of those.

34:21.117 --> 34:22.618
JOI: Yeah, shall
we get two of them?

34:22.618 --> 34:23.753
GORDON: Yeah.

34:23.753 --> 34:25.421
(speaking in native language).

34:25.421 --> 34:28.024
Thank you. They're
beautiful aren't they.

34:28.024 --> 34:30.126
What do they cost altogether?

34:32.061 --> 34:33.763
JOI: 40,000 Kip.

34:33.763 --> 34:35.631
GORDON: A steal.
At just $5.

34:37.367 --> 34:39.068
JOI: That's good yeah?
Shall we carry on.

34:39.302 --> 34:43.940
GORDON: Thank you.
With more ingredients
still to get,

34:44.774 --> 34:47.610
we've got to crack on,
to not be late for the Monks.

34:47.944 --> 34:50.680
So, it's pedal to
the metal, or not?

34:52.014 --> 34:54.350
I do think I can walk
quicker than this taxi.

34:57.553 --> 35:01.057
The daily Nagazon
market is packed full of
incredible Mekong produce.

35:03.359 --> 35:04.761
Look at these fish here.

35:09.365 --> 35:10.700
GORDON: Fermented fish?

35:14.036 --> 35:15.071
GORDON: Padek?

35:17.774 --> 35:19.075
GORDON: Rice.

35:21.944 --> 35:23.479
GORDON: It smells amazing.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.016
GORDON: Soup, yeah.

35:27.450 --> 35:28.918
GORDON: Yeah.

35:32.155 --> 35:33.656
GORDON: That's delicious.

35:33.656 --> 35:35.191
JOI: Yeah.
GORDON: That's
really delicious.

35:35.191 --> 35:38.261
Everything is not just
only super fresh, but no
one's using refrigeration.

35:38.661 --> 35:39.896
JOI: No, no, no.

35:39.896 --> 35:41.330
GORDON: That's the reason
why we got everything.

35:41.330 --> 35:43.466
JOI: Get everything fermented
and, fresh fermented, yeah.

35:43.966 --> 35:45.234
GORDON: Fermented fish.

35:45.234 --> 35:47.403
I mean, what a great way
of finishing those stews.

35:47.403 --> 35:50.139
It's all starting to
make sense, cause here's
like the heartbeat.

35:50.640 --> 35:52.909
I've seen it all come
into one little zone now.

35:53.543 --> 35:54.677
How amazing all this is.

35:54.677 --> 35:56.045
JOI: Yes, the Bok Choy.

35:56.045 --> 35:58.681
Do you know they grow
it along the Mekong?

35:58.681 --> 35:59.749
GORDON: This is grown
on the Mekong as well?

35:59.749 --> 36:01.451
JOI: Yeah, yeah.

36:01.451 --> 36:03.853
GORDON: We've collected all
our ingredients, and there's
just time for a little

36:03.853 --> 36:05.655
pick‐me‐up before we cook.

36:05.655 --> 36:07.123
I was hoping
for a quick coffee,

36:07.123 --> 36:10.259
but Joi wants me to try the
local stimulant, beetle nut.

36:12.562 --> 36:14.363
JOI: Take that leaf and
you put the beetle nut in.

36:14.764 --> 36:17.433
So, this beetle
nut, they grow along
the river bank.

36:17.667 --> 36:20.603
GORDON: Okay. Again, so
much alongside the river.

36:21.037 --> 36:23.239
JOI: Yes. And (inaudible).

36:23.806 --> 36:27.477
They say when you
are chewing it, that
it makes you feel dizzy.

36:28.311 --> 36:30.112
GORDON: Why would you
chew that if you're
going to feel dizzy?

36:30.112 --> 36:31.781
JOI: Because it's
got tobacco in it.

36:31.781 --> 36:33.015
GORDON: Tobacco?
JOI: Yeah.

36:33.015 --> 36:35.117
GORDON: So, you
roll this up. You ready?

36:35.418 --> 36:39.689
JOI: Ready. One...
GORDON: Two. Three.

36:53.436 --> 36:57.340
(speaking in native language).

36:57.340 --> 36:59.242
(laughs).

37:05.781 --> 37:09.585
GORDON: Sorry.
No, No, (bleep). No!

37:11.187 --> 37:14.257
The locals may love the beetle
nut for a quick pick me up.

37:14.257 --> 37:16.325
Why did you (bleep)
make me do that?

37:16.325 --> 37:19.428
But, the only time
I'll pick it up again is to
toss it in the nearest bin.

37:28.037 --> 37:31.707
Having survived my partial
poisoning, it's time to face
the day's real challenge.

37:33.276 --> 37:37.113
Using everything I've learned
this week to cook for the
Monks of Wok Cong Thai Temple.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.450
This looks amazing.

37:41.450 --> 37:43.352
JOI: Yes.
Beautiful temple.

37:43.619 --> 37:46.055
GORDON: Wow. More
revered than Royalty,

37:46.556 --> 37:50.393
these guys are used to the
cream of this country's cuisine.

37:51.360 --> 37:52.828
We're up against
it time wise, right?

37:52.828 --> 37:54.096
JOI: Yeah, yes.

37:54.096 --> 37:55.798
GORDON: And, as they
start fasting at mid‐day,

37:55.798 --> 37:58.868
I've got just two hours
to prepare my feast,
and lay it before them.

38:00.136 --> 38:01.871
This is it.
Everything I've understood.

38:01.871 --> 38:03.506
Got up to speed
with this week.

38:03.506 --> 38:05.207
It all comes down to this.

38:05.207 --> 38:06.876
Hey, how difficult
are the monks?

38:06.876 --> 38:08.411
Are they, like, food critics?

38:08.411 --> 38:10.479
JOI: Yeah.
Some, some of them.

38:10.479 --> 38:14.650
GORDON: Every time I
get to cook for a Festival,
Royalty, Monks, trust me,

38:14.650 --> 38:18.321
there's always those
nerves, so, it's going to
be a tough one this morning.

38:21.991 --> 38:23.859
The Cat fish stew, okay.

38:24.126 --> 38:27.563
My main dish is a sweet and
sour fish stew, inspired
by Mr. Muang's daughters.

38:29.465 --> 38:31.867
So nice, using
fish this fresh.

38:32.435 --> 38:34.837
And, my trip to the market.

38:35.504 --> 38:36.906
I'll use a
fermented fish sauce.

38:36.906 --> 38:38.407
JOI: Yes, fermented fish sauce.

38:38.407 --> 38:41.143
GORDON: To give that the sort
of nice fermented sour flavor

38:41.143 --> 38:43.312
at the base of
this catfish stew.

38:43.312 --> 38:45.648
I'm also going to put a touch
of tamarind in that as well.

38:45.648 --> 38:47.783
JOI: Ah, nice.
Get rid of the sour texture.

38:47.783 --> 38:49.685
GORDON: The sour
texture, that's right.

38:51.721 --> 38:54.056
Joi is also cooking a
catfish main course.

38:54.056 --> 38:56.692
And for his sauce
he's really branching out.

38:58.127 --> 38:59.662
Are you really chopping
wood to put in the soup?

38:59.662 --> 39:01.530
JOI: Yes, come look over.

39:01.530 --> 39:03.466
GORDON: You've
gone barking mad.

39:03.466 --> 39:05.668
JOI: Yeah.
GORDON: But, what does
the wood do to the soup?

39:05.668 --> 39:07.870
JOI: It get the bit of
shake on pepper texture.

39:07.870 --> 39:09.839
GORDON: Okay.
JOI: Make your mouth
numb and tingly.

39:09.839 --> 39:11.741
GORDON: Very interesting.

39:12.441 --> 39:15.144
And, by interesting I mean,
really freaking weird.

39:15.811 --> 39:18.314
But, right now I can't
afford to get distracted.

39:18.314 --> 39:22.318
JOI: So, we now close
to 10:00, so we've
got about an hour.

39:22.618 --> 39:26.155
GORDON: Why can't we just
spend one day here eating at
2:00 p. m. in the afternoon.

39:26.622 --> 39:27.990
Just give us a bit more time.

39:30.192 --> 39:32.461
GORDON: But telephone
the chief Monk.

39:32.762 --> 39:34.196
(laughs).

39:38.567 --> 39:41.570
Right, catfish stew done.
Please.

39:42.038 --> 39:44.607
JOI: Need chili.
GORDON: Need chili?

39:45.074 --> 39:47.543
JOI: Yeah, a bit more
chili, a bit of tamarind.

39:47.543 --> 39:49.879
GORDON: Yeah.
There's me thinking
it's too hot.

39:51.147 --> 39:52.581
It's too soury.

39:52.581 --> 39:54.050
And he's saying more chili.

39:54.050 --> 39:56.052
I mean, unbelievable.

39:57.053 --> 39:59.989
While I chop some more
chili for my stew, Joi's
onto his second course.

40:02.858 --> 40:04.827
What do you do with
the lemon grass?

40:04.827 --> 40:08.998
JOI: Ah, I'm spreading
the lemon grass to
stuff the fish inside.

40:11.901 --> 40:15.304
GORDON: Fish wrapped in
intricate lemon grass parcels.

40:15.304 --> 40:16.772
Amazing.

40:16.772 --> 40:19.642
Except for the fact
that I'm behind and
Joi needs my kitchen.

40:21.510 --> 40:22.812
GORDON: Do you want
to borrow my fryer?

40:22.812 --> 40:24.914
JOI: Yes, yes, please.

40:25.147 --> 40:27.616
GORDON: Now, you're
treating me like I'm
your sous chef now.

40:28.250 --> 40:30.052
JOI: Yes, yes.

40:30.453 --> 40:33.089
GORDON: I thought
you were sort of
sweet, endearing and helpful.

40:35.491 --> 40:37.326
GORDON: Look outside sweet,
but inside not sweet.

40:37.326 --> 40:41.197
Outside sweet,
inside competitive.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.235
What happens if they
don't like the food?

40:47.470 --> 40:48.804
GORDON: They won't
give me the blessing?

40:48.804 --> 40:50.673
JOI: No.

40:51.674 --> 40:54.110
GORDON: With my kitchen back,
I can finally start
my second course.

40:55.344 --> 40:59.281
A spicy take of the banana leaf
fish wrap I ate on the banks
of the Mekong five days ago.

41:03.052 --> 41:06.722
Aah. It's a beautiful way of
tying up these little packets.

41:08.491 --> 41:10.259
Do you want some help?

41:10.259 --> 41:12.461
JOI: Um, I'm good
for now, thank you.

41:12.461 --> 41:13.529
GORDON: I was joking.

41:13.529 --> 41:15.531
I'm busy enough as it is.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.203
With just 30 minutes left,
Joi's throwing some catfish
steaks on the barbecue.

41:22.271 --> 41:25.074
But I have one of those
incredible Coney Falls fish.

41:25.975 --> 41:30.045
I'm going to lightly coat
this fish, stuff it with the
herbs and the lemon grass.

41:31.547 --> 41:34.116
Yeah. And then, yeah,
I'm going to literally
quickly fry it.

41:38.254 --> 41:40.856
I've never had
to cook this fast.

41:40.856 --> 41:41.924
JOI: What?

41:41.924 --> 41:44.193
GORDON: No. I'm a
little bit in the (bleep).

41:44.193 --> 41:46.162
JOI: Okay. You're not
allowed to say bad word in here.

41:46.162 --> 41:48.564
GORDON: (Bleep).
JOI: Not a nice word.

41:49.999 --> 41:51.867
GORDON: (Bleep), (bleep).
JOI: No! No!

41:51.867 --> 41:53.002
GORDON: No? Not even.

41:53.002 --> 41:54.203
JOI: Nice word.
Nice words?

41:54.203 --> 41:56.138
Give me a word for (bleep).

41:57.106 --> 41:59.441
Bad karma or not, I'm
struggling to hold my tongue.

42:00.142 --> 42:02.311
JOI: We're against the time.
We need to finish.

42:02.645 --> 42:05.047
GORDON: Because the
pressure is really on.

42:05.281 --> 42:06.782
Where, where, where
do I wash my pan?

42:06.782 --> 42:07.917
JOI: In the river.

42:07.917 --> 42:10.686
GORDON: Oh, for
god's sake man.

42:15.057 --> 42:17.426
But, with just moments to
spare, I'm onto my final dish.

42:18.527 --> 42:20.963
Now I get to use the super
strength gecko rice whisky.

42:21.797 --> 42:25.100
And, three words we can
all enjoy, caramelized
flambé bananas.

42:26.669 --> 42:28.337
JOI: Um, no, no, you can't.

42:28.337 --> 42:29.738
GORDON: Hold on a minute!

42:29.738 --> 42:32.041
JOI: No, you can't do
moonshine for the Monk.

42:32.041 --> 42:33.676
GORDON: It will
be caramelized.

42:33.676 --> 42:35.110
The alcohol will be gone.

42:35.110 --> 42:37.479
JOI: But still got the,
you've got alcohol in it?

42:37.479 --> 42:38.480
GORDON: Please?!

42:38.480 --> 42:40.783
JOI: No, no, you can't.

42:48.090 --> 42:51.026
They beat the drum for
the people to bring the
food into the temple.

42:52.228 --> 42:55.731
GORDON: The Monks may live
a holy life, but missing
out on my banana flambé

42:55.731 --> 42:57.900
may be their greatest
sacrifice of all.

42:58.200 --> 42:59.235
JOI: We better hurry.

42:59.235 --> 43:00.636
GORDON: Yes! Yes! Yes!

43:00.636 --> 43:02.104
Time to plate up.

43:02.104 --> 43:06.642
(drum)

43:14.183 --> 43:18.487
(drum)

43:19.121 --> 43:21.357
Okay Joi.

43:21.357 --> 43:23.993
JOI: You done?
GORDON: Just in time.

43:26.262 --> 43:28.264
Finally, my feast is finished.

43:28.264 --> 43:32.935
A sweet and sour catfish stew,
spicy banana leaf fish wrap,
Coney Falls finest catch.

43:33.535 --> 43:35.704
And, a snake bean salad.

43:37.907 --> 43:40.309
But Joi's outdone himself.

43:40.309 --> 43:42.144
A wood infused catfish soup.

43:42.144 --> 43:47.783
Delicate lemon grass and fish
parcels, and mouthwatering
barbecued fish steaks.

43:49.351 --> 43:50.653
This is crazy.

43:50.653 --> 43:52.721
I think just eat at the
same time every day,
2:00 would be fine.

43:52.721 --> 43:54.056
JOI: Yes, every time yeah.

43:54.056 --> 43:55.925
GORDON: Oh (bleep)!

44:03.365 --> 44:06.001
I have the honor
of serving the Head
Monk and his Novices.

44:06.735 --> 44:08.304
Please enjoy.

44:10.239 --> 44:13.876
Meal times are sacred,
so Joi and I grab a sneak
peep from a distance.

44:33.062 --> 44:36.665
GORDON: Watching the
Monks eat my dishes
feels a bit spiritual.

44:36.665 --> 44:40.469
Hopefully it's a taste
of heaven, and they won't
condemn me to eternity,

44:41.103 --> 44:43.238
doing the dishes
in <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

44:48.077 --> 44:50.179
Finally,
the moment of truth.

45:02.524 --> 45:04.593
JOI: He said
everything tasted good.

45:04.893 --> 45:05.995
GORDON: Excellent.

45:05.995 --> 45:08.063
Please ask him about
the catfish stew?

45:14.436 --> 45:15.604
GORDON: He liked it?

45:15.604 --> 45:17.072
JOI: Yeah, he liked it.

45:17.072 --> 45:18.941
GORDON: Would you
explain that I did have
a dessert for caramelized

45:18.941 --> 45:20.943
bananas with moonshine,
but we are not allowed?

45:21.677 --> 45:23.412
But, next time, I'll
just barbecue the bananas.

45:23.412 --> 45:24.947
JOI: Okay.

45:25.914 --> 45:29.084
(speaking in native language).

45:31.820 --> 45:34.490
GORDON: Clearly he's
not impressed with
my flambé faux pas.

45:36.191 --> 45:38.293
But, I've still done
enough to earn a blessing.

45:45.868 --> 45:49.738
On my Laotian journey, I've
unearthed a vibrant cuisine
that's packed full of flavors,

45:50.672 --> 45:53.342
and found in the
most surprising places.

45:53.776 --> 45:56.145
As the Laotian people
slowly emerge from poverty,

45:56.145 --> 45:59.348
the Mekong River
continues to give them
something very valuable.

46:00.616 --> 46:03.752
A rich culture that
thrills the taste buds
and feeds the soul.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.588
That is priceless.

46:09.358 --> 46:10.526
What an amazing
week, thank you.

46:10.526 --> 46:11.827
JOI: Yeah, thank you.
Nice to visit.

46:11.827 --> 46:13.429
Yeah, good luck, So be it.

46:13.429 --> 46:14.963
GORDON: See you soon.
Amazing week.

46:14.963 --> 46:16.865
JOI: Thank you.

46:16.865 --> 46:19.902
GORDON: And so with my
karmic balance restored,
at least for the moment,

46:19.902 --> 46:22.971
it's on to my next adventure.
