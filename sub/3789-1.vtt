01:30.758 --> 01:32.216
Hey, it's me!

01:32.634 --> 01:34.385
Yep. We just landed.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.512
Okay. Cool.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.557
The guy's not home five seconds,
he's already calling Kristen.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.808
Oh, boy, here we go.

01:40.893 --> 01:43.227
You don't want her thinking
you're dying to see her, do you?

01:43.437 --> 01:45.313
Turtle's right, E. Let her think you're busy.

01:45.397 --> 01:48.608
She's my girlfriend, idiots.
I don't care what she thinks.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.985
I don't have to play games anymore.
Tell them, Vince.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.196
Come on, what do I know
about relationships?

01:53.280 --> 01:55.823
What kind of girlfriend won't come
see you while you're away working?

01:55.908 --> 01:57.325
The kind of girlfriend in school.

01:57.409 --> 02:00.077
I went to school.
How hard is it to cut out on that shit?

02:00.162 --> 02:02.413
Not that hard when you're headed for a GED.

02:02.498 --> 02:06.209
Three months without pussy, E. That's rough.
You're almost a virgin again.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.418
Why do you think he's calling?

02:07.503 --> 02:09.419
It's like the guy got his hymen restored.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.839
Vince, you ever go three months
without pussy?

02:11.924 --> 02:15.551
- Vince, ain't never gone three days.
- Wait, that's not true.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.719
Sophomore year.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.763
- Really?
- Well, you had mono.

02:19.723 --> 02:22.058
- Good memory, E.
- That shit don't count.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.769
Yo, Johnny, is there another slice left?

02:24.895 --> 02:27.522
No, sorry, bro.
Polished it off over the Grand Canyon.

02:27.773 --> 02:30.525
We need an Eddie's out here. LA pizza blows.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.819
Why is it so hard
to get a good slice in LA anyway?

02:32.903 --> 02:36.030
Tap water. That's why you can't
get a decent bagel either.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.156
Except on Fairfax.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.575
There's different water on Fairfax?

02:40.077 --> 02:43.287
Yeah, Vince.
The Jews import it from Borough Park.

02:44.039 --> 02:44.997
I'm serious.

02:45.082 --> 02:48.543
If that were the case, then why can't you get
a good slice on Fairfax?

02:48.627 --> 02:50.670
Because Jews don't make pizza, idiot.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.756
So, given your theory, Drama,
I should get a decent pizza bagel at Canter's.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.841
Uh-huh.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.175
Wrong, E!

02:56.260 --> 02:58.719
Kosher mozzarella tastes like tofu.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.264
Tofu?

03:02.474 --> 03:05.309
- Did you call for a car, Turtle?
- Was I supposed to?

03:05.394 --> 03:06.936
No, we're supposed to walk home.

03:07.062 --> 03:10.690
Summer break's over, E.
Time to get your soldiers in line.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.192
Guy's not my soldier. I inherited him.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.945
- Hey, fuck you.
- I hate the new system.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.155
Check it out.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.033
You called them and asked them not to tow it?

03:21.118 --> 03:24.453
It would be cooler if I left it
for Homeland Security to impound.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.788
Shotgun!

03:31.044 --> 03:32.920
I hate the new system.

03:35.340 --> 03:40.428
All right, so, remember, gardener, pool guy,
newspaper, vet, alarm company,

03:40.512 --> 03:45.099
satellite, Gelson's, dry cleaning,
and get the MLB package hooked up.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.227
Oh, call your boy Busey, Vince.
We're finally gonna accept that gift.

03:48.312 --> 03:49.979
I hope it's not a self-portrait.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.023
Turtle, will you do me a favor?
Will you take this stuff in?

03:52.107 --> 03:54.317
Vince, I want his job.
The guy's sitting on Easy Street.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.777
Turtle, please.
You're like a three-time lotto winner.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.029
Where you going?

03:58.363 --> 04:00.031
Three months, Vince. Three months.

04:00.115 --> 04:01.908
Yeah, you won't last five minutes.

04:01.992 --> 04:03.618
He won't last five seconds.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.495
What are you doing?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.456
You got me thinking. Take me to Stacy's.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.000
No, Jamie's. No, Stacy's.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.419
What?

04:13.503 --> 04:15.046
What the fuck are we supposed to do?

04:15.130 --> 04:17.464
Jerk each other off, you losers!

04:17.882 --> 04:20.009
Yeah, don't forget your bag!

04:23.055 --> 04:24.931
- Help me with this stuff?
- Yeah.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.767
I got Arnold. Come on, Arnold, let's go.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.197
What?

04:41.740 --> 04:43.366
I have my period.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.743
Oh, fuck. Really?

04:46.203 --> 04:48.829
Yeah. Bad timing, huh?

04:48.914 --> 04:50.039
Yeah.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.210
You know. I mean...

04:55.212 --> 04:57.713
- Maybe...
- What?

05:00.300 --> 05:04.053
It's been three months.
Maybe a little something else.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.680
- No.
- Why?

05:05.764 --> 05:08.599
Because that wouldn't be fair to me.

05:09.267 --> 05:12.395
I've been waiting to have sex with you
for three months also.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.355
Yeah, but it's easier for girls to hold out.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.232
No. Eric.

05:17.401 --> 05:20.569
I feel gross. I feel fat and bloated.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.822
Well, you're not. You're beautiful.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.575
- Saturday night.
- What?

05:27.035 --> 05:28.244
We can get really drunk.

05:28.328 --> 05:32.832
And since you're this big hotshot manager
making the big bucks,

05:32.916 --> 05:35.459
we can get a room at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.545
Big bucks? I made $6,000 on that movie.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.172
Okay, well, we'll split the room.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.258
We'll have the best sex ever.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.343
What are we gonna do now?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.262
Just kiss.

05:46.972 --> 05:49.932
- She wouldn't even blow you?
- Or give you a nice tug?

05:50.017 --> 05:51.142
That's bullshit.

05:51.226 --> 05:54.186
You act like a priest for three months,
the least the girl can do is service you.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.855
That is a little selfish.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.816
Had I shown up
and Kristen was missing a leg,

05:58.900 --> 06:01.736
I still would have taken care of business.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.989
You would have sex
with a girl on her period?

06:05.073 --> 06:06.699
Who wouldn't, man?

06:07.284 --> 06:10.036
Hey, I've done it. It's not something I hope for.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.371
You guys are disgusting.
I don't think I've ever done that.

06:12.456 --> 06:13.581
Well, you should, altar boy.

06:13.665 --> 06:16.542
Because it's a fact
a girl on her period is hornier.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.586
And there's no need for a raincoat.

06:18.670 --> 06:21.338
- It's like Flag Day.
Except it's a week. Hold that!

06:25.844 --> 06:27.386
Hey, what's up?

06:31.767 --> 06:33.225
What the fuck?

06:33.477 --> 06:35.895
Hey, guys. I'm Lloyd, Ari's new assistant.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.646
What's up, man? I'm Vince.

06:37.981 --> 06:38.981
I know who you are.

06:39.357 --> 06:42.026
If Ari gives you a hard time
let me know, all right?

06:42.152 --> 06:43.569
What happened to Emily?

06:43.653 --> 06:45.696
I don't know.
Can I get you something to drink?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.698
- Water.
- Water sounds good.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.493
I'm good.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.081
- What are you being an asshole for?
- Yeah?

06:55.165 --> 06:57.708
A bigwig like Ari should have
a hot assistant to look at.

06:57.793 --> 07:00.211
Johnny, some people probably think
he is hot.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.962
I ain't one of them people.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.047
Come on, Turtle, let's go.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.925
The only reason we stopped
was to see how Emily treated you.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.009
Peace.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.886
The boys are back in town!

07:09.513 --> 07:10.846
You like "Gaysian Lloyd"?

07:10.931 --> 07:13.724
He's cute, right? And he covers two quotas.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.935
Did you fire Emily?
- I had to.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.354
To make sure you wouldn't
fuck another one of my assistants.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.189
You're not gonna try to fuck Lloyd?

07:20.273 --> 07:21.774
Did you really fire her?

07:21.858 --> 07:23.818
James Cameron stole her.
She's over at Lightstorm.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.278
So, how was the little movie?

07:26.363 --> 07:29.782
Honestly, one of the best experiences
of my life.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.576
That's fantastic.
But you got it out of your system, right?

07:32.661 --> 07:35.162
I wanted to talk to you about that.

07:36.665 --> 07:40.251
I ran into Neil LaBute in New York.
He wants me to do his play in London.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.461
Six months, $300 a week.

07:42.546 --> 07:45.756
But I figure with your negotiating skills,
you can get me $400.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.925
And it's very well written.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.719
Okay, Ari, I'm joking.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.847
I'm ready to work. What do you got?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.355
Hiya, Mary.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.652
Hi, I'm Carla. Adam's new assistant.

08:07.529 --> 08:08.904
Can I get you guys something to drink?

08:09.906 --> 08:13.492
You have a Diet Creamsicle Shasta,
by any chance?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.495
Johnny, Turtle.

08:17.914 --> 08:18.998
Adam!

08:20.667 --> 08:22.334
You have an office!

08:22.794 --> 08:25.838
And you've got a smoking-hot assistant.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.465
Yep, and it's all because of this guy.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.134
- Really?
- No, not really.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.468
Sit. Sit.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.308
So, I'm back and I'm ready.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.227
Great! Exciting stuff going on.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.354
Yeah?
- I'm circling something at NBC.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.523
TV?

08:44.858 --> 08:47.693
I thought maybe after Queens Boulevard,
we could get a movie.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.321
Oh, this is a movie. A movie of the week.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.740
But I have a little problem.

08:53.617 --> 08:55.993
Your headshots, they're setting us back.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.996
I've had those shots since '92.
They've been great.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.039
What's the problem?

09:00.123 --> 09:04.543
The problem is people get annoyed
when they expect to see a 24-year-old.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.256
Does this look like you?

09:13.094 --> 09:14.970
- You ready?
- Let's go, we're ready.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.055
This kid's got no patience.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.015
In some countries,
they would cut off your elfin feet

09:18.099 --> 09:21.518
- for disrupting the master's flow.
- How about I shove my elfin foot up your ass?

09:21.603 --> 09:23.229
- You missed me, didn't you?
- Ari, come on.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.105
All right, you ready?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.149
Aquaman!

09:29.361 --> 09:31.070
- Aquaman?
- Aquaman, baby!

09:31.154 --> 09:33.656
It is Spiderman underwater! Boom.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.783
- Is there a script?
- ARl: No, I know he doesn't like to read,

09:35.867 --> 09:38.410
so I got you something with pictures.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.666
Tell him, E.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.042
Oh, tell me what?

09:45.335 --> 09:47.419
- We know what we want to do next.
- What?

09:47.504 --> 09:49.004
The fucking Belt Parkway?

09:49.172 --> 09:51.507
- Relax. It's a studio movie.
- Really?

09:51.591 --> 09:52.841
It's big.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.426
Show him.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.098
What is this, some Showtime miniseries?
Come on.

09:59.182 --> 10:02.351
No, it's Medellin. The Pablo Escobar story.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.520
Sex, drugs and salsa!

10:04.896 --> 10:08.357
- Did you read it?
- ARl: I know about it. It's at Universal.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.693
This movie is gonna be the new Scarface.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.278
Which was our favorite movie growing up.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.613
ARl: Really?
Here's the story.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.035
I come from the gutter, that's okay.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.456
I got no education, I know that.
There will be no stopping me.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.792
I go straight to the top, Ari!

10:30.463 --> 10:32.131
This is the kind of studio movie
we want to do.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.465
What're you gonna do about it?

10:33.550 --> 10:35.801
I'll get into it.
But I'm also deep into Aquaman.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.594
I got a meeting with Dana Gordon.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.096
Well, should I be there?

10:40.557 --> 10:41.598
No.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.684
Unless you wanna pull up her car

10:43.768 --> 10:45.686
- or serve us crÃ¨me brÃ»IÃ©e.
- Go fuck yourself.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.314
- Not gonna work this year.
- What're you talking about?

10:48.398 --> 10:50.107
- What did I tell you?
- I can't play with the guy?

10:50.191 --> 10:52.484
- What's the deal? We gotta battle.
- Go easy.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.737
- He's having a rough day.
- What happened?

10:54.946 --> 10:57.197
- He's not getting any.
- Oh, no. You kidding me?

10:57.282 --> 11:00.034
You want me to get Lloyd in here
and have him hari-kari you with his pecker?

11:00.118 --> 11:01.660
Or no? No?

11:02.620 --> 11:04.204
I thought the girlfriend was still in play.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.582
Bad time of the month to come home.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.208
ARl: You're like me.
Yeah? How so?

11:08.293 --> 11:10.169
I won't even fuck my wife
after she plays tennis.

11:10.462 --> 11:11.462
Oh...

11:11.588 --> 11:13.172
Listen, here's the deal.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.799
I got other things to discuss
with Dana Gordon.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.343
So you set your own meetings.

11:17.427 --> 11:21.764
But, Vinnie, the good news is,
Warner's loves you. Know it.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.933
This year you're going to jump
to the next level, baby.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.727
- Sounds good.
- Sounds fine.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.438
I'd say hug it out,
but I don't want you drawing wood.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.858
All right? This is your year, baby. Your year!

11:40.700 --> 11:41.867
Jesus.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.123
Try this side.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.047
Turtle! Turtle!

11:55.131 --> 11:57.299
What the fuck you screaming about?
I'm right here.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.094
- What's going on?
- Everything. Just like you asked.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.472
It's fucking chaos out there.
You couldn't spread things out?

12:03.556 --> 12:06.058
I have my system, you had yours.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.476
What is this thing out here on the front lawn?

12:07.560 --> 12:10.979
That's Busey's gift.
It's a psychedelic totem pole.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.773
I thought he was giving us a painting.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.024
I told him I liked that one better.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.235
We don't own this house.
What are we gonna do with it when we move?

12:16.319 --> 12:18.570
Fucking leave it. It's ugly as shit.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.531
I told him Vince would take
a picture in front of it, though.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.658
Now you're pissing me off.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.870
Maybe you should try doing my dog shit job
and I should try being Vince's manager.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.081
I did your job.
- Not like this.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.958
Vince never yelled at you.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.419
You yell at a guy, you break his spirit.

12:33.503 --> 12:36.422
Vince, does his new title allow him
to yell at me all the time?

12:36.506 --> 12:37.923
That was in his deal. Sorry!

12:38.007 --> 12:39.842
Don't be so sensitive, Turtle.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.635
- What day is she on, E?
- Who?

12:41.719 --> 12:44.596
- Kristen! What day of her period is it?
- Day two.

12:44.681 --> 12:47.141
- You're in for a rough week.
- Not as rough as E.

12:47.225 --> 12:50.561
Can I buy you a blow job?
It would make both our lives easier.

12:50.645 --> 12:53.439
Nope, I'm fine. Don't need any of that.
Just gotta make it to Saturday night.

12:53.523 --> 12:54.940
What? You made a sex date?

12:55.024 --> 12:57.067
He's got to wine and dine his own girlfriend?

12:57.152 --> 12:59.945
I thought the whole reason
people have girlfriends is for effort-free sex.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.613
Are you sure she's not trying
to avoid fucking you?

13:01.698 --> 13:04.533
Exactly. Whoever heard of a girl
who cycles mid-month?

13:04.617 --> 13:05.617
Mmm-hmm.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.161
When do you cycle, Drama?

13:07.620 --> 13:09.580
Hey, Turtle, let's go outside
and take a couple shots.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.206
I already took care of your head shots.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.501
- You can't let Turtle take your headshots.
Why not?

13:14.586 --> 13:16.336
Because you need a professional.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.630
You want me to call David LaChapelle?
He owes me a favor.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.300
The guy charges five grand to set up a light.

13:21.384 --> 13:24.052
- I already took care of this, Drama.
- So, I'll pay.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.096
It's your career. You can't fuck around with it.

13:26.181 --> 13:29.808
It's emasculating having
your kid brother pay for your headshots.

13:29.893 --> 13:32.603
And him paying for the rest of your life
is empowering?

13:32.687 --> 13:35.147
Vince don't pay for shit of mine.
Everything's on my tab.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.607
Tell him, bro.

13:36.691 --> 13:39.526
It's all a loan, okay? So borrow the money.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.571
It's not the money. It's the principle.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.490
- I can't let them win.
- Who's them?

13:44.574 --> 13:46.033
The conspirators in this town

13:46.117 --> 13:48.869
who force the good actors out of the business
by draining their resources

13:48.953 --> 13:50.996
with shit they don't need, like,

13:51.080 --> 13:52.664
fucking headshots.

13:52.749 --> 13:56.251
Your headshots are taken care of.
If someone would just listen to me.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.545
- By who?
- Trust me, all right?

13:59.380 --> 14:01.048
See, I'm a multi-tasker.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.175
You're a regular Martha Stewart, Turtle.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.053
At any point am I gonna get
any credit from anyone?

14:06.429 --> 14:08.555
We'll see, Turtle. We'll see.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.475
California Pizza Kitchen?

14:11.559 --> 14:13.894
- Did you buy this?
- Yeah, it's New York style.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.647
Not with guacamole on it, it's not.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.483
You guys are all over me today. Jesus!

14:19.567 --> 14:23.445
Oh, come on, don't be so sensitive.
I'll eat the shitty pizza!

14:24.656 --> 14:27.699
Vince, you should take a look
at this Aquaman. It's cool for a comic book.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.701
You know what,
I don't want to do Aquaman.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.703
Afraid you don't got the body
to fill out the suit?

14:31.788 --> 14:34.831
I didn't want to tell Ari, get the hard sell.

14:34.916 --> 14:37.376
- Will you tell him?
- Sure, I'll lock him into Medellin.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.725
Excuse me, was anyone gonna call me
and tell me you're back?

14:53.810 --> 14:54.977
You didn't know we were back?

14:55.061 --> 14:56.770
I knew you were back
because Gary Busey told me.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.313
He wants that shot with Vince.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.566
- Eric Murphy, this is Amanda Peet.
- Hey.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.360
Hey.
Eric is Vincent Chase's manager.

15:03.486 --> 15:04.820
- Oh, hey.
- Nice to meet you.

15:04.946 --> 15:07.114
You too!
When's Vince gonna do another movie?

15:07.198 --> 15:08.657
- Soon, very soon.
Good.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.576
You should find Vince a movie to do
with Amanda.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.536
- Yeah!
- That would be great.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.496
I'm more than a publicist.
I really should produce.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.165
Give me your card, I'll give you a call.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.167
You know what, I don't have a card.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.253
What's the name of your company?

15:22.755 --> 15:24.089
You know what,
I don't have a company either.

15:24.173 --> 15:27.009
- I'm getting that going.
- I'll put you two in touch.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.385
Okay, great.

15:28.469 --> 15:30.387
- Nice meeting you.
- I'll call you.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.222
You sound like a fucking moron,
you know that?

15:32.307 --> 15:34.600
Thanks, Shauna. It's weird.
Your eyes, they look black in this light.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.602
- You should seriously...
- Hey.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.437
You're not gonna keep me waiting are you?
What're you doing?

15:38.521 --> 15:40.897
- Hey, Shauna!
- Oh, fuck you, Ari!

15:40.982 --> 15:42.691
Hey, hey, who speaks like that at Koi?

15:42.775 --> 15:45.235
I apologize. She's in PR.
She knows not what...

15:45.320 --> 15:47.738
You need to be punished. Let's go.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.159
This is retarded.

15:52.243 --> 15:55.037
Do you wanna drop two grand on headshots?

15:57.540 --> 15:59.625
This won't be out for another four weeks.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.252
What do we have to do
to make sure my boy gets picked?

16:02.337 --> 16:03.837
I do the picking.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.798
How do I know this isn't your signature?

16:06.883 --> 16:09.092
Come on, Christy, are you crazy?

16:09.177 --> 16:12.471
That's the classic Vincent Chase swoop
on the V right there.

16:12.555 --> 16:15.057
Yeah, yeah. I got the same thing with my J.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.517
Who are you?

16:19.896 --> 16:22.689
I had an unbelievable lunch
with Dana Gordon.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.733
The script is coming in next week.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.568
And kanpai...

16:26.653 --> 16:30.197
I think I convinced her to attach Vinnie
before they get a director.

16:30.281 --> 16:31.615
I should get a fucking Pulitzer.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.076
Ari, Vince doesn't want to do Aquaman.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.410
What do you mean
he doesn't want to do Aquaman?

16:35.495 --> 16:36.536
He hasn't read the script.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.664
He has read Medellin. He wants to do that.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.957
Where did you get that one? Josh Weinstein?

16:41.501 --> 16:44.419
- A little insecure, Ari?
- How did you get it?

16:44.504 --> 16:46.630
Turtle found it on the subway.
What's it matter? We wanna do it.

16:46.756 --> 16:50.509
And I want to fuck Angelina Jolie.
The only difference is, I might have a shot.

16:50.593 --> 16:51.635
We don't have a shot?

16:51.719 --> 16:53.345
No, you want to know why?
They're out to a guy.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.389
I don't know if you ever heard of him.
His name is Tom Cruise.

16:55.473 --> 16:58.684
Tom Cruise is gonna play Pablo Escobar?
The guy is not even Hispanic.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.310
Hilary Swank has a vagina

17:00.395 --> 17:02.562
and she won an Oscar
pretending she has a dick.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.397
That's what actors do, they pretend.

17:04.482 --> 17:07.192
I get it. I get it, okay.
So, what if Cruise passes?

17:07.276 --> 17:09.403
They go to Brad Pitt.
He passes, they go to Keanu Reeves.

17:09.487 --> 17:11.154
And on down the list.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.323
- Where is Vince on that list?
- He ain't on the list.

17:13.407 --> 17:17.411
- How do we get him on the list?
- You do Aquaman, you stupid fuck.

17:24.669 --> 17:27.128
- Let's go.
All right, let's do it.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.141
Okay, great. I think we got what we need.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.977
Wait, hold on a second, pal.
I got a couple of wardrobe changes.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.311
Turtle!

17:49.986 --> 17:51.653
Who is this guy?

17:54.323 --> 17:57.242
- Okay.
- Suck in that gut a little, Drama.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.744
Fuck you, Turtle.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.288
How's the hair look? Good?

18:03.166 --> 18:06.334
Before he did Born on the Fourth of July,
Tom Cruise did Top Gun.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.879
Hanks fucked a fish
before he did Forrest Gump.

18:08.963 --> 18:14.259
We need a commercially viable popcorn flick,
like Matterhorn would have been.

18:14.343 --> 18:17.721
- We can get Aquaman.
- We can get a lot of things.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.599
Since Vince doesn't want to do Aquaman,
let's talk about those things.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.768
Really, we can get a lot of other things?
You know?

18:22.852 --> 18:24.436
- Yeah.
- You know what we can get?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.438
You don't even know the name
of your own fucking company.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.440
Stop cursing at Koi. You're embarrassing me.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.775
You know what's embarrassing,

18:29.859 --> 18:32.986
is that you are managing your best friend
right out of the business.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.654
- That would roughly be embarrassing.
- That is not true.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.616
You'll be singing a different tune
when you see Queens Boulevard.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.078
We need a career intervention,
is what we need.

18:42.163 --> 18:46.041
No more arguing. No more bullshit.
We're going to sit down, the three of us,

18:46.125 --> 18:49.628
and I'm going to lay out for you clearly,
what our options are.

18:49.712 --> 18:54.424
This town is littered with the trashed careers
of the 'once upon a time' movie stars.

18:54.509 --> 18:56.968
Don't let our boy be a cautionary tale.

19:00.765 --> 19:06.061
Okay. Well, I conceptualized this
when I was on a walk-about in the Badlands.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.688
And I stumbled on this briar patch of berries.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.233
And I ate every berry I could see,

19:11.317 --> 19:13.944
because I thought that would be
nurturement from the earth to me.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.654
Vincent. Teeth.

19:15.738 --> 19:19.658
And after I ate the berries, this came to me.
Each one of these represents...

19:19.742 --> 19:22.410
Don't ever commit to shit
without talking to me first.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.496
I gotta have some freedom to operate, E.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.956
You gotta earn freedom.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.417
Why didn't you get this guy to do my shots?
He's a real pro.

19:29.544 --> 19:32.128
All right, you know what?
Fuck you and fuck you, all right?

19:32.213 --> 19:34.339
That's it, I'm done. I quit.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.884
What's he quitting?

19:38.594 --> 19:39.886
He gets paid?

19:39.971 --> 19:42.848
I don't think there's a word
in the Earth language

19:42.932 --> 19:44.766
or in the dictionary to define

19:45.935 --> 19:47.978
what it did to me. But it was up in here.

19:48.062 --> 19:50.522
It was in my heart, my spirit,
my soul, my mind, my emotions.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.649
- No anxiety...
- Gary, how many pictures do we need?

19:52.775 --> 19:57.070
One perfect one.
It comes from the light of the sun after it's set.

19:57.613 --> 19:58.947
It's 11:30 now, Gary.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.367
I know it is.
But we must wait for this precious time.

20:02.451 --> 20:03.827
Well, we have a meeting.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.913
Your meeting and your future is meaningless.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.665
Gary, a couple more pictures and that's it.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.084
Guys, let me ask you a question.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.086
What's more important...

20:14.046 --> 20:16.381
Oh, great. Now what?

20:19.427 --> 20:21.928
Got a big one for you fellas today.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.850
Yo, H&H Bagels. All right!
How you doing, Blake?

20:26.934 --> 20:30.437
What's happening?
Yo, check it out. Carnegie knishes.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.646
Nice!

20:31.981 --> 20:33.356
What else you got?

20:33.441 --> 20:35.317
Whatever this is.
Oh!

20:36.611 --> 20:38.069
Eddie's Pizza!

20:38.154 --> 20:40.196
What a score. It's like being back in New York.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.616
- Nice, E!
- I didn't do it.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.242
Who did?

20:47.997 --> 20:50.749
Jesus, E. You never came up
with something like this.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.959
Yo, great job, Turtle. Come down here!

20:53.044 --> 20:54.377
Yeah, Turtle, good job!

20:54.462 --> 20:56.004
Oh, any corned beef?

20:58.132 --> 21:02.093
I'm not coming out till all of you apologize.
And that means you, too, Vince.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.389
I'm sorry.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.224
I didn't do nothing.

21:08.559 --> 21:09.893
Sorry, Turtle!

21:10.478 --> 21:11.853
Now the Lucky Charm.

21:13.522 --> 21:16.650
- Come on, E.
- Yeah, come on. This is impressive.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.569
Whose DHL number is this?

21:19.654 --> 21:21.029
It's Ari's.

21:24.575 --> 21:25.784
I'm sorry.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.118
I knew you would like that.

21:27.203 --> 21:29.120
Get down here and help us carry this shit.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.164
Yeah, that figures.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.471
These are great.

21:47.223 --> 21:48.390
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

21:48.557 --> 21:50.976
Except, what's with the big apple
behind your head?

21:52.144 --> 21:53.812
It doesn't matter.

21:54.271 --> 21:57.065
This is our year, Johnny. Can you feel it?

21:59.402 --> 22:02.362
So, twice in two days, huh?

22:02.571 --> 22:04.239
Must be important.

22:04.615 --> 22:06.241
E didn't explain the situation to you?

22:06.450 --> 22:09.369
Did you explain to E
that there wouldn't be any lunch?

22:09.453 --> 22:12.455
I would have waited for my pizzas to defrost.

22:12.623 --> 22:14.082
You didn't tell him what I told you?

22:14.166 --> 22:15.500
I told him you wanted to sit down and talk.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.169
I thought we just sat down and talked.

22:18.254 --> 22:20.547
What's the situation, Ari? You seem stressed.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.593
Yeah. We can't get Medellin.

22:26.303 --> 22:27.512
Why not?

22:28.014 --> 22:29.514
Because they're looking at other people.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.850
So call and tell them to look at me.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.018
You don't think I've been on the phone?

22:33.102 --> 22:35.979
You're the most powerful agent
in the business.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.105
One of the most powerful, yeah.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.858
No, you said when I signed with you,
you were the most powerful.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.943
- He said that to you?
- A bunch of times.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.236
Shut the fuck up, Eric!

22:43.320 --> 22:46.614
Listen, Ari, snap out of it, all right?

22:46.699 --> 22:49.034
If they're not looking at me, you call them.

22:49.118 --> 22:53.288
Tell them to look at me.
They'll listen to you, all right? We cool?

22:53.748 --> 22:55.373
I'm starved. Let's get outta here.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.459
Vince, we have to do Aquaman.

23:00.463 --> 23:02.213
You didn't tell him any of this?

23:02.298 --> 23:04.841
No, he told me. He told me, okay?

23:04.925 --> 23:07.635
And Eric also told you
that I don't want to do Aquaman.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.972
If we can't get Medellin,

23:11.057 --> 23:12.891
then we will wait
for something else that I love.

23:13.142 --> 23:16.478
For the past three months,

23:16.562 --> 23:18.897
while your boy has been sitting
on your indie set pouring creamers

23:18.981 --> 23:23.068
and getting no pussy,
I have been scouring this town for an offer.

23:25.279 --> 23:26.905
It ain't out there.

23:27.531 --> 23:28.698
Come on.

23:29.450 --> 23:30.533
Okay.

23:30.826 --> 23:34.412
Here's an offer for you to star
in a new Olsen twins movie.

23:34.497 --> 23:36.790
It's a love triangle
in which little Mary-Kate and Ashley

23:36.874 --> 23:39.250
use you as an experiment to see if you can tell

23:39.335 --> 23:41.169
if they are two separate, distinct people.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.837
This would be mildly amusing

23:42.922 --> 23:47.092
if the producer didn't think
he had a realistic shot of getting you.

23:51.722 --> 23:55.100
It ain't eight months ago, man.
Listen, you cooled off.

23:55.351 --> 23:57.519
The $5 million offers do not exist.

23:57.603 --> 24:00.688
But Warner's loves you, so Aquaman does.

24:04.485 --> 24:05.527
What do you think, Eric?

24:07.863 --> 24:10.031
We should read Aquaman
and then see what's what.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.617
Excellent representation. Nice work, E.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.328
You know what I think?
I would rather quit the business

24:15.412 --> 24:17.247
than to do more shit that I don't love.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.959
I've done that. And you know what, it sucks.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.795
I was only partially joking
about Neil LaBute, Ari.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.213
I'll go do a play.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.715
I'd rather do a play than this bullshit.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.218
Don't forget, I came from nothing.

24:30.302 --> 24:33.304
As much as I love the toys, I don't need them.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.019
Well, that went well.

24:44.275 --> 24:47.193
I don't want this to get to a place
where you start blaming me for everything.

24:47.278 --> 24:49.237
You guys don't listen to me. Listen to this.

24:49.822 --> 24:54.909
You tell your boy to do Aquaman,
or you tell him to find other representation.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.434
Yo!

25:21.020 --> 25:23.354
My headshots were a monster hit.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.154
This is gonna be a great fucking year.

25:31.614 --> 25:33.198
Can you feel it?

25:34.305 --> 25:40.303
