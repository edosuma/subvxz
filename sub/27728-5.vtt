ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO #105
"Don't Speak"
Closed Captioned

00:00.334 --> 00:01.793
Previously
on Roswell, New Mexico...

00:01.793 --> 00:04.421
Aliens are amongst us,
working to undermine

00:04.421 --> 00:06.924
the very fabric of our society.

00:06.924 --> 00:08.258
My dad knew about aliens.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.510
That's how I got the autopsy.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.761
(gasps)

00:10.761 --> 00:12.137
Liz confronted me last night.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.765
She knows that Rosa
was killed by an alien.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.225
If Liz Ortecho
turns on any of us,

00:16.225 --> 00:18.268
you will get inside
of her head and erase it,

00:18.268 --> 00:19.811
make her
leave Roswell,

00:19.811 --> 00:22.189
just like you did
ten years ago.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.941
I don't think I'm strong enough
to change Liz's mind.

00:23.941 --> 00:26.026
Liz Ortecho's looking
for a murderer.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.110
I'm gonna confess.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.613
After all, I'm the one
that killed those girls.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.208

00:57.849 --> 00:59.768
♪ ♪

01:08.443 --> 01:10.570
Your valve cover was shot.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.448
I'm not letting you
turn yourself in.

01:14.366 --> 01:16.493
Look, why don't we hit the road,
the three of us.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.537
You're not hitting anything

01:18.537 --> 01:20.247
unless you get a new
coolant temperature sensor.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.416
If you tell Liz you did it,

01:22.416 --> 01:24.334
she's not gonna stop
until she gets justice.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.337
Okay? If you get exposed,
Isobel and I get exposed.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.548
You don't think they're gonna
wonder where you came from?

01:29.548 --> 01:31.300
Huh? Is that-- Look into
your history? I mean,

01:31.300 --> 01:33.885
the three naked, mute kids
who just appeared one day?

01:33.885 --> 01:35.512
If you go down,

01:35.512 --> 01:39.057
we all go down,
whether you like it or not.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.767
(vehicle approaching)

01:42.519 --> 01:44.146
Perfect timing.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.318
Hey, man.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.236
What, uh, what
brings you out here?

01:51.236 --> 01:53.822
Early morning rations run.

01:53.822 --> 01:57.034
Figured the three of you
could use it.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.828
Well, thank you.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.038
Where's Iz?

02:01.038 --> 02:02.414
She's not here.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.624
Well, she didn't
come home last night.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.836
And when she doesn't come home,
she's with you guys.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.963
Always.

02:09.963 --> 02:13.133
Yeah, she was. She-she passed
out on my couch, you know.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.635
Gave her some wine,
old home movies, you know.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.220
A lot of wine.
Yeah.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.014
And now she's...?

02:19.014 --> 02:20.599
Goat yoga.

02:20.599 --> 02:23.560
Yeah, we'll call you if we,
if we hear from her.
Yeah.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.978
I'll talk to
you guys then, yeah.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.897
S-See you.
All right, sounds good.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.445
Thanks, Cam.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.906
Her car was picked up
by Cowboy Ruckus on 285.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.867
There was no sign of a struggle,
but the keys were still inside.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.745
Ah, when I dropped her off
last night, she was exhausted.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.706
Noah wasn't back from
work yet, so I figured,

02:44.706 --> 02:46.792
I figured she'd go
right back to sleep.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.419
You want to try
calling her again?
Yeah, all right.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.384
(softly): What the...?

02:58.011 --> 02:59.012
(knocking on door)

02:59.012 --> 03:01.848
What's up, Doc?

03:04.601 --> 03:06.436
What?
Nothing.

03:06.436 --> 03:11.316
You're just... Wow.

03:11.316 --> 03:15.195
(clears throat) Uh,
what's got you so dressed up?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.864
Interview for that
research position.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.366
Huh.
Okay.

03:19.366 --> 03:23.078
No offense, but you...
do not look so "wow."

03:23.078 --> 03:25.372
I've been up all night,
processing the fact

03:25.372 --> 03:26.581
that everything
I knew about

03:26.581 --> 03:28.250
my dead dad was a lie.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.585
My mom gave me this.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.462
When he died, she went
through all his stuff

03:32.462 --> 03:34.381
and put anything unsavory
into this box.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.425
So far, I've learned that my dad

03:36.425 --> 03:38.802
had two stints in rehab
for booze in the '80s,

03:38.802 --> 03:41.388
multiple affairs
over his entire marriage,

03:41.388 --> 03:42.431
and, oh, yeah,

03:42.431 --> 03:45.434
a pervasive obsession
with aliens.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.644
Rosa drew this.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.896
I still hoped I was wrong
about them having an affair.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.899
Me, too. Teenage addict
with a record

03:52.899 --> 03:57.195
and the town sheriff--
the optics are ugly.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.448
Listen,

03:59.448 --> 04:01.366
this has been a lot.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.119
I have to work,
and I haven't slept.

04:04.119 --> 04:07.789
Is it okay if we maybe
pump the brakes

04:07.789 --> 04:09.291
on the sleuthing
for one day?

04:11.042 --> 04:12.502
My dad and your sister
aren't going to be

04:12.502 --> 04:13.587
any less dead tomorrow.

04:16.131 --> 04:17.757
I got stuff to do, too.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.676
I'll call you tomorrow.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.739

04:56.004 --> 04:57.506

04:57.506 --> 04:59.841
I'm pretty sure someone
is trying to tip my cows.

it's my husband.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.184
Nice to meet you.
You, too.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.186
Please, come on back.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.812
LIZ:
Our study was controversial.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.105
There were some
ethical complaints

05:14.105 --> 05:16.024
regarding
componentation.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.318
The usual.
Right.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.655
But the work that you're doing
with vessel regrowth is amazing.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.907
I mean, a few years ago,
people never could have imagined

05:23.907 --> 05:25.784
this kind of progress
in stem cell research.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.245
I mean, it's borderline
science fiction.

05:28.245 --> 05:31.790
Look, this kind of science,
healing what others believe

05:31.790 --> 05:35.168
to be irreparable,
is important to me.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.670
It's all I've ever wanted to do.

Hello, 911?

become a cabbage.

OPERATOR 2: Sir?
MAN 2: People are, uh,

05:54.813 --> 05:56.815
floating in the middle
of the desert.

Send the lizard people,
another earthquake,

06:08.994 --> 06:10.996
another phony
tidal wave.

06:10.996 --> 06:14.082
I cut through the scrim
of falsity that you'll believe

06:14.082 --> 06:16.001
is a concrete wall.

06:19.296 --> 06:22.966
I don't have time for your
hilarious mockery today, lady.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.927
Cool. Me neither.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.638
I just want to know exactly
what you saw in the desert

06:28.638 --> 06:30.056
the night my sister
was murdered.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.898
I heard you on the police
tip line that night.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.318
You said you saw
three people floating?

06:41.318 --> 06:42.485
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.737
I recognized your voice.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.238
Because you subscribe
to my podcast?

06:45.238 --> 06:48.283
Because it haunts my nightmares.

06:48.283 --> 06:51.911
Okay, look, I know people
say they don't believe you,

06:51.911 --> 06:53.496
but I do

06:53.496 --> 06:55.206
this time.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.334
I need details.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.128
I need the video.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.672
There is no video.

07:02.672 --> 07:06.051
You said on the tape that you
were making a documentary.

07:12.307 --> 07:15.435
Nothing is an accident, got it?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.479
No.

07:19.105 --> 07:22.817
People who talk end up dead.

It's just north
of the Long farm.

Slip him $20, and he'll

Your dad's,
technically.

09:29.694 --> 09:34.407
So you want to tell me why
you drove all the way out here?

09:34.407 --> 09:36.576
Legacy, I guess.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.789
This place wasn't part
of the assets in his will.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.416
Guess I wanted to know
what happened to it.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.669
Well, when I got back from Iraq,
he left me the key

I could have the place.

No.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.886
Why would he leave
this place to you,

09:54.886 --> 09:56.971
instead of me or my mom?

09:56.971 --> 09:58.223
I... I don't know.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.682
When I got back,
he had already passed.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.059
I never got a chance to ask.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.607
You recognize this?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.734
Yeah. Key chain
looks like mine,

10:09.734 --> 10:11.945
but that key's too small
for the door.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.823
Mind if I poke around and
see if I can find the lock?

10:14.823 --> 10:16.199
Then I'll take off.

When I got here,
I put everything

good ol' days in the closet.

We don't know what
we're walking into.

10:49.983 --> 10:50.984
She could be in trouble.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.360
She could be the trouble.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.945
Her car was picked
up from this spot.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.113
What brought her out here?

10:55.113 --> 10:56.322
Doesn't matter

Trauma.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.787
Last time she had

11:02.787 --> 11:04.455
an episode like this was
near the end of high school,

11:04.455 --> 11:05.957
when she was afraid
I was gonna abandon her.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.292
Okay, now she thinks
she's gonna lose you,

11:07.292 --> 11:09.460
she thinks she's lost me to Liz;
she's freaking out, man.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.503
It's triggering her.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.798
Or maybe it's all this talk
about Rosa.

11:13.798 --> 11:18.177
Max... maybe it's time
we tell her the truth.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.554
That is out of the question.

11:19.554 --> 11:20.805
Just try and call her.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.059

11:30.732 --> 11:33.735
ISOBEL:
Max.

11:33.735 --> 11:34.694
Got her.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.626
That's not a lock.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.045
Yeah, got distracted.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.839
Do you remember that night
your dad made us

11:54.839 --> 11:57.675
set up that tent to teach us
extreme weather survival?

11:57.675 --> 11:59.177
Yeah.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.179
Your dad had driven home
for the night,

12:01.179 --> 12:04.223
so mine concocted a brand-new
form of kiddie torture.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.935
(grunts)

12:06.935 --> 12:08.937
We found a way to
sneak back inside.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.605
(groans)

12:10.605 --> 12:13.316
We were a good team.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.401
Yeah.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.986
Until you grew
one chest hair

12:16.986 --> 12:19.197
and instantly became
a nightmare of a bully.

12:19.197 --> 12:22.825
Like some bro jock
from an '80s movie.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.788
I don't know why
I was like that.

12:26.788 --> 12:30.124
Because I was gay.

12:30.124 --> 12:34.587
People started to notice,
and you were afraid that,

12:34.587 --> 12:37.215
if you were nice to me, people
would think you were gay, too.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.217
(chuckles)

12:39.217 --> 12:41.511
I'm sorry, I-I
didn't think that...
Don't.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.346
Please. I don't know
if you've noticed,

12:43.346 --> 12:45.473
but I've been
through a lot worse

12:45.473 --> 12:47.600
than your locker room
taunting at this point.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.486
(sighing)

12:58.486 --> 13:00.613
How much longer do you
think this is gonna take?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.699
I don't know.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.368
Whoa. Damn it.

13:09.706 --> 13:10.623
Whoa.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.961
Hey, um, uh, help me move this.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.304
ALEX:
What the hell?

13:25.304 --> 13:26.764
Did you know about this?

13:26.764 --> 13:27.932
No, dude.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.853
Okay, so this is the point
in the horror movie

13:31.853 --> 13:33.938
where the audience starts
screaming, "No, don't do that."

13:33.938 --> 13:35.606
What's the worst thing
we can find?

13:35.606 --> 13:37.400
What... Literal skeletons.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.618
(door creaking)

14:06.804 --> 14:08.473
MAX:
There she is.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.105
Isobel.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.276
What happened?

14:20.276 --> 14:21.736
I don't know.

14:23.905 --> 14:25.031
It's happening again.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.118
Just like it was before.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.746
It's okay, it's okay.
We're here, we got you.

14:31.746 --> 14:34.207
We're not gonna let anything bad
happen to you, okay?

14:44.342 --> 14:47.261
KYLE:
I think I'd prefer skeletons.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.077
Why did you really come here?

15:13.037 --> 15:15.289
I'm looking
into Rosa Ortecho's death.

15:16.415 --> 15:19.377
Liz's sister?
The DUI?

15:19.377 --> 15:21.462
Liz has questions.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.509
What, you think that your dad
had something to do with it?

15:28.886 --> 15:31.639
I think Rosa and my dad
were having an affair.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.309
No.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.686
Your dad was a good guy.

15:40.731 --> 15:43.651
You know why he left me
this house, and not you?

15:43.651 --> 15:46.487
Because you were fine.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.239
You were popular.

15:48.239 --> 15:52.743
You were at the top
of your class in med school.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.537
Your mom loved you.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.707
I wasn't loved.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.750
My mom was gone.

15:59.750 --> 16:03.379
My dad was a homophobic,
abusive dick.

16:04.505 --> 16:07.049
And your dad saw it.

16:07.049 --> 16:10.928
He left me these keys so that
I would have a place to go.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.766
He wasn't the type of person
who would take advantage

16:15.766 --> 16:17.852
of a desperate teenager.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.355
He would help them.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.745
Hello? Mr. Green?

17:05.524 --> 17:07.443
♪ ♪

17:18.829 --> 17:21.123
(gasps)

17:25.503 --> 17:28.047
Qué susto.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.929
NEWSMAN:
Roswell, 1947.

17:34.929 --> 17:37.139
While the men, women
and children

17:37.139 --> 17:39.475
of this quiet
New Mexico town slept,

17:39.475 --> 17:41.352
a force greater...
(recording stops)

17:41.352 --> 17:43.354
(sighs)

17:45.940 --> 17:47.942
(gasps)

17:47.942 --> 17:49.735
Who sent you?

18:01.038 --> 18:02.790
Look.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.336
This is for detoxing.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.425
My dad had been through
the 12 Steps.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.552
A couple times.

18:14.552 --> 18:17.596
Maybe... he was trying
to keep her in here

18:17.596 --> 18:20.182
to get her clean?

18:20.182 --> 18:22.101
Or maybe I'm just
thinking wishfully again

18:22.101 --> 18:24.312
and I need to get a grip.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.771
Something isn't right.

18:25.771 --> 18:30.776
Uh, yeah. "Wrong" would be
closer to my choice of words.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.452
It's locked.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.619
Your key.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.878
Okay, I just want
to talk, Grant.

18:48.878 --> 18:49.837
Can you put the gun down?

18:51.464 --> 18:52.798
Please?

18:52.798 --> 18:54.967
Yeah.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.635
(loud pop)
LIZ: Oh!

18:58.429 --> 19:01.140
I'm on a watch list.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.892
(sighs)

19:02.892 --> 19:04.477
Okay.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.733
I am actually interested
in your documentary.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.360
I know I was skeptical
in the past,

19:12.360 --> 19:15.863
but... you may be right.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.157
You don't think that.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.159
I have seen things, Grant.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.620
I want to know who sent you.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.038
How you heard that police tip...

19:24.038 --> 19:25.748
I thought you would be impressed
with my passion

19:25.748 --> 19:26.749
for uncovering the truth.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.084
I'm "intrepid."

19:28.084 --> 19:30.127
I told you,
there's nothing on the tape.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.963
Look, before The Gravity
of It All podcast,

19:32.963 --> 19:35.466
I was a peyote documentarian.

19:35.466 --> 19:40.054
Highly respected
in peyote documentary circles.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.972
So you were tripping
that night out in the desert?

19:41.972 --> 19:44.058
Out of my mind.

19:47.103 --> 19:50.773
That's why they didn't
worry about silencing you.

19:50.773 --> 19:54.193
They figured no one
would believe you anyway.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.736
You weren't a loose end.

19:57.488 --> 19:58.781
Who's "they"?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.953
You tell me.

20:12.378 --> 20:16.632
A couple of guys showed
up later that year.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.677
I, uh, gave them a tape.

20:19.677 --> 20:23.180
It was either that
or a slow death.

20:23.180 --> 20:27.435
Of course, it wasn't the tape.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.654
I thought you'd be
well on your way

20:38.654 --> 20:41.031
to San Quentin by now.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.908
Guessing you didn't
confess all your sins?

20:42.908 --> 20:44.910
Nah, he's not going anywhere.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.871
Max thinks my idea

20:46.871 --> 20:50.916
of me confessing is what set you
off on this little spirit quest.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.960
What do you mean?

20:52.960 --> 20:54.170
Well, I mean,
the last time you had

20:54.170 --> 20:55.754
an episode was
in high school.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.923
I thought maybe something
triggered old trauma.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.717
You know? I don't know, like

20:59.717 --> 21:02.553
your fear that someone you love
will be taken away from you?

21:02.553 --> 21:03.637
Who, Michael?

21:03.637 --> 21:06.265
What, are you kidding?

21:06.265 --> 21:09.018
No. I'm already dreaming up
ways to convert that Airstream

21:09.018 --> 21:11.270
into a shabby-chic
Instagram trap.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.605
(soft laughter)

21:12.605 --> 21:14.815
No, I don't think
it's trauma.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.692
I think I just

21:16.692 --> 21:18.277
exhausted myself
trying to use my powers

21:18.277 --> 21:19.487
to get Liz out of town.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.363
(sighs)

21:21.363 --> 21:23.115
I don't think I anticipated
how much harder

21:23.115 --> 21:25.451
it was gonna be this time.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.957
Harder?

21:31.957 --> 21:34.335
Yeah, you know,
'cause I'm out of practice,

21:34.335 --> 21:35.920
so everything is
harder this time.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.046
That's not what you meant.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.299
Max, that's what she...
Isobel.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.218
Have you messed
with Liz's mind before?

21:42.218 --> 21:43.802
MICHAEL:
She told you.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.846
She tried at the drive-in.

21:47.181 --> 21:49.600
That's why you suggested it.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.101
Not because
it was some brilliant idea

21:51.101 --> 21:52.311
y'all had
come up with,

21:52.311 --> 21:53.562
but because it worked before.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.106
(laughs softly)

21:56.106 --> 21:59.068
You made Liz leave.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.819
After Rosa,
after high school.

22:00.819 --> 22:04.156
She didn't abandon me,
you sent her away.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.116
Say it.

22:06.116 --> 22:09.370
Give me that much.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.397
I'd recognize
his hands anywhere.

22:52.496 --> 22:57.501
My dad didn't have an affair
with Liz's sister.

22:57.501 --> 23:00.754
He had an affair with her mom.

23:00.754 --> 23:04.008
That's why he was trying
to help Rosa sober up.

23:04.008 --> 23:07.219
That's why he was never the same
after she died.

23:09.221 --> 23:13.976
Rosa was his daughter.

23:16.604 --> 23:17.646
I always knew

23:17.646 --> 23:20.149
we weren't alone.

23:20.149 --> 23:22.901
Now, as I got older,
I tried to fight it.

23:22.901 --> 23:26.030
You know, deny what I knew
in my core was true.

23:26.030 --> 23:28.365
They exist.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.997
(Liz gasps)

23:34.997 --> 23:36.957
Rosa...

23:36.957 --> 23:40.044
Y-Y-You had this
the whole time?

23:40.044 --> 23:41.503
Why didn't you tell
anyone about it?

23:43.422 --> 23:45.841
Because I'm not stupid.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.384
I took the money,
rather than a slow death.

23:47.384 --> 23:48.969
What money?

23:48.969 --> 23:50.929
What-- no, I've said too much.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.681
People who talk end up dead.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.767
You literally talk
more than anybody

23:54.767 --> 23:56.894
has ever talked ever,
in history.

23:56.894 --> 24:00.773
Well, not about anything real.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.776
(gasps)
I get it.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.694
S-So someone pays you

24:05.694 --> 24:07.655
to-to flood
the airwaves

24:07.655 --> 24:09.990
with-with bogus
conspiracy theories

24:09.990 --> 24:11.950
and extremist propaganda,
and anything real

24:11.950 --> 24:14.703
seems small in comparison.

24:16.497 --> 24:18.290
Alien fake news.

24:18.290 --> 24:21.210
You should hear
my 9/11 theories.

24:21.210 --> 24:23.337
Who paid you to stay quiet?
MAN:
All you had to do

24:23.337 --> 24:24.755
was not talk.
(gunshot)

24:24.755 --> 24:26.674
(shouts)

24:26.674 --> 24:29.051
I should have known!
Quiet, for once.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.678
(panting):
Bars on the windows.

24:30.678 --> 24:32.513
We got to figure out a way
to get out of here.

24:32.513 --> 24:35.140
No! Every general
and scientist

24:35.140 --> 24:37.518
who investigated
the original crash-- dead.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.520
Okay? Your sister,
I bet she knew.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.523
Dead. Jim Valenti,
he knew. Dead.

24:42.523 --> 24:44.858
Now Liz Ortecho and Grant Green.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.151
(shouts)

24:46.151 --> 24:47.986
(panting)

24:47.986 --> 24:49.988
How many shots was that?

24:49.988 --> 24:52.491
What?
Shots. Six, and he has to
reload. That's our chance.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.410
(gunshots)

24:54.410 --> 24:55.411
That was four.

24:55.411 --> 24:57.371
We have to split up.
No.

24:57.371 --> 24:59.998
You broke in,
I tried to stop you.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.125
No. Wait. What are you...?

25:03.585 --> 25:04.920
Five, six.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.884
We were just trying
to protect the secret, Max.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.261
ISOBEL:
You were all smitten

25:12.261 --> 25:13.679
and messed up
and you wanted to tell Liz.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.639
I wasn't smitten. I loved her.

25:15.639 --> 25:16.932
How was I supposed to know that?
I don't know,

25:16.932 --> 25:20.018
Isobel, maybe if you were
a damn mind reader!

25:20.018 --> 25:22.479
I thought you had a crush.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.356
A dangerous one that could
threaten all of our lives,

25:24.356 --> 25:25.816
including yours.

25:25.816 --> 25:27.526
A-And you've made the rules
our entire lives.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.570
"Never be extraordinary."

25:29.570 --> 25:31.488
Just once,
we made a game-time decision.

25:31.488 --> 25:32.823
It was for your own good.

25:32.823 --> 25:34.658
You lied for ten years!

25:34.658 --> 25:36.910
Sometimes you keep things
from the people

25:36.910 --> 25:39.955
that you love
to protect them. Hey,

25:39.955 --> 25:41.206
kind of like how you've been
lying to the love

25:41.206 --> 25:42.207
of your life about
this little murder thing.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.792
You know? Rosa
and her friends?

25:43.792 --> 25:46.670
Well, ever since Liz drove away,
I have never been happy.

25:46.670 --> 25:47.880
Not once.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.423
I have been idling

25:49.423 --> 25:53.802
because I don't think
I deserved a goodbye.

25:53.802 --> 25:57.222
And do you know what got me
out of bed in the morning?

25:58.766 --> 26:00.976
How much I loved you two.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.651
MICHAEL:
Look.

26:11.612 --> 26:13.238
This is ancient history.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.239
(gasps)
(grunts)

26:14.239 --> 26:15.240
It's not!

26:15.240 --> 26:16.200
It is right now.

26:17.951 --> 26:20.412
I need to talk to Liz.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.580
Where is she?

26:21.580 --> 26:22.998
I don't know. How would I know?

26:22.998 --> 26:24.166
You got into her head
a couple days ago.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.375
The connection is still there.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.211
Find her, Isobel!

26:35.427 --> 26:36.720
(high-pitched ringing)

26:39.890 --> 26:41.642
What-what, what is it?

26:42.768 --> 26:45.103
She's in trouble.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.188
Give me your keys.

26:46.188 --> 26:47.523
Give me your keys!

26:47.523 --> 26:48.857
She's near
the Long farm.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.317
Hey.

27:01.245 --> 27:03.163
(tires screech)

27:05.749 --> 27:08.085
(gun clicking)

27:12.339 --> 27:13.924

27:18.387 --> 27:20.973
NEWSMAN:
Roswell, 1947.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.891
While the men, women
and children

27:22.891 --> 27:25.143
of this quiet
New Mexico town slept,

27:25.143 --> 27:27.437
a force greater than any of them

27:27.437 --> 27:29.898
could ever have imagined
hovered above.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.525
It started out
as a burst of light

27:31.525 --> 27:34.027
burning through the night sky.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.946
Was it a shooting star?

27:35.946 --> 27:38.657
A comet? Or something more?

27:38.657 --> 27:43.662
Aliens landed that night,
proving we...

27:43.662 --> 27:45.622
(Liz shouts)

(grunting)

WYATT:
Who did you tell?

28:23.869 --> 28:25.162
Wyatt!

28:25.162 --> 28:26.330
Who did you tell?

28:32.961 --> 28:36.048
LIZ:
I'll tell you everything.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.341
Let me out first, please.

28:37.341 --> 28:38.675
I have nothing to lose.

28:48.602 --> 28:50.479
(screams)

28:50.479 --> 28:51.480
Wyatt!

28:51.480 --> 28:54.232
Why are you
doing this?

28:54.232 --> 28:56.234
(sniffles)

28:56.234 --> 28:58.153
(Liz coughing)

29:08.705 --> 29:10.624
Wyatt!

29:11.959 --> 29:13.085
(wood cracks)

29:36.483 --> 29:37.776
(muffled shout)

29:37.776 --> 29:38.777
It's me.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.446
Are you okay?

29:45.826 --> 29:47.244
It's Wyatt Long.

29:47.244 --> 29:49.830
(exhales)

29:49.830 --> 29:51.832
I am... sorry

29:51.832 --> 29:56.294
for dragging you into all this.

29:56.294 --> 29:57.671
Kyle.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.967
How many men do you know
who were a father

30:01.967 --> 30:03.969
to any and every kid
who needed one?

30:03.969 --> 30:06.346
That's who Jim
Valenti was.

30:06.346 --> 30:08.098
And he was yours.

30:08.098 --> 30:09.891
The dad I got

30:09.891 --> 30:12.936
was a monster. Is a monster.

30:12.936 --> 30:15.564
Because he sent you off to war?

30:17.983 --> 30:20.110
My father was my war.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.698
And your dad saw it,
when we were kids.

30:24.698 --> 30:26.158
Do you remember the summer

30:26.158 --> 30:28.744
that we built
the tree house?
Yeah.

30:28.744 --> 30:31.580
That's the summer that my dad
found out I was gay.

30:31.580 --> 30:34.124
He knew before I did.

30:34.124 --> 30:37.961
He thought he could
beat it out of me.

30:37.961 --> 30:40.255
Jim tried to intervene.

30:40.255 --> 30:43.592
But you can't make someone
stop hating someone.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.097
And my dad hated me.

30:53.643 --> 30:55.312
(scoffs)

30:55.312 --> 30:56.730
You've got it wrong, you know.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.692
My dad didn't leave you
that key because

31:00.692 --> 31:03.653
he thought you were weak.

31:03.653 --> 31:06.114
He would've never thought that
about you.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.495
You're the bravest person
I know.

31:19.544 --> 31:20.754
(door closes)

31:24.091 --> 31:25.634
(knuckles crack)

31:25.634 --> 31:26.885
(exhales deeply)

31:29.679 --> 31:31.723
Is there
anyone else here?
Greg Green.

31:31.723 --> 31:35.018
Somewhere.
Okay. Follow me.
Stay close.

31:36.770 --> 31:37.896
Don't move.

31:39.481 --> 31:40.649
On your knees now.

31:44.486 --> 31:45.779
(gasps)

31:48.240 --> 31:49.741
MAX:
We got to go.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.910
Stay behind me.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.748
(sirens wailing)

31:57.415 --> 31:58.542
It's Wyatt...

32:01.837 --> 32:03.130

32:05.757 --> 32:06.800
(grunting)

32:06.800 --> 32:07.801
Max!

32:07.801 --> 32:09.845
Max. Hey.

32:09.845 --> 32:11.304
I'm so sorry.

32:11.304 --> 32:13.515
(grunting)
I'm sorry.

Max.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.228

Max.

32:18.228 --> 32:20.814
I'm sorry.
(grunts)

32:23.108 --> 32:24.234

(sighing)

32:58.226 --> 33:00.729
(winces)

33:00.729 --> 33:03.565
I went to the hospital;
they said you left.

33:05.609 --> 33:07.569
Did you do
self-surgery?

33:07.569 --> 33:08.695
MAX:
I'm not wired like you.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.405
I can't have doctors
finding out.

33:11.656 --> 33:14.784

33:14.784 --> 33:17.913
This thing doesn't
make any sense.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.624
Wyatt is a racist with
a chip on his shoulder,

33:20.624 --> 33:22.334
but he's also a coward.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.794
A-And murdering Grant Green,
going after you...
Max.

33:24.794 --> 33:26.004
Can I look
at the wound, please?

33:26.004 --> 33:28.131
I'm fine.
You're obviously
in a lot of pain.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.050
(sniffles)

33:33.011 --> 33:34.304

39:16.729 --> 39:19.732

You didn't cover up

40:06.654 --> 40:08.823
my sister's murder

40:11.326 --> 40:14.454
You covered it up

40:16.247 --> 40:17.248
Those--
the three bodies.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.043
Floating out of the cave,
that was Michael.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.296
He... He-he couldn't
move them be--

40:23.296 --> 40:25.548

40:50.281 --> 40:51.658
What's the secret?

40:51.658 --> 40:53.201
I didn't kill
those girls, Isobel.

40:55.411 --> 40:56.579
You know who did.

40:57.914 --> 40:59.374
You've always known.

41:00.625 --> 41:01.918
No.

And Michael's was broken then.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.728
So that is why

41:20.728 --> 41:22.855
you have,
you've covered all of this up.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.857
That is, that is why
you have been lying

41:24.857 --> 41:27.402
all of this time.

41:27.402 --> 41:29.445
Because the person
that you love most in the world

41:29.445 --> 41:30.655
is the one who did it.

41:30.655 --> 41:33.991
Tell the truth...
for once.

41:35.243 --> 41:37.161
It was Isobel, wasn't it?

Yes.
