WEBVTT

00:21.282 --> 00:24.067
So the Miserium is just...

00:24.111 --> 00:25.895
gone?!

00:25.938 --> 00:27.505
It's pretty touching, though.

00:28.898 --> 00:31.248
How they put aside
their differences?

00:38.125 --> 00:40.388
You got to be more positive!

00:40.431 --> 00:43.043
There's got to be
something else

00:43.086 --> 00:45.045
we can use at the school
that has more power.

00:50.920 --> 00:54.271
You hold that thought.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.186
It appears we
have a visitor.

00:59.146 --> 01:01.148
Oh...

01:01.191 --> 01:03.846
Yes!

Fly.

02:38.593 --> 02:40.029
Try flapping
your arms.

02:40.072 --> 02:42.205
Superman doesn't flap his arms.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.425
Well, Superman's an alien,
you're a bird.

02:44.468 --> 02:45.948
Yeah, well, you didn't
know you were a fairy

02:45.991 --> 02:46.949
until yesterday.

02:46.992 --> 02:48.385
Don't be smug.

02:48.429 --> 02:51.127
Look, I know I'm just
your stand-in friend

02:51.171 --> 02:52.824
until Rafael gets back.

02:52.868 --> 02:53.999
What?

02:54.043 --> 02:55.784
But why is this
so important to you?

02:55.827 --> 02:57.220
So what if you can't fly?

02:57.264 --> 02:58.439
No one here flies.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.092
Look, I... I believed in you.

03:00.136 --> 03:03.226
Can you be the one person here
who believes in me?

03:04.271 --> 03:05.620
All right.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.100
Hey, do you know
how to get a key

03:08.144 --> 03:09.580
to the roof of the school?

03:09.624 --> 03:13.454
Well, I am the student
security supervisor.

03:13.497 --> 03:14.585
Of course you are.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.152
Well... can you get it?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.023
I think I just need to
start with more height.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.069
You know?

03:20.112 --> 03:22.463
Thanks, man.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.079
You got to be kidding me.

03:30.122 --> 03:32.124
DORIAN:
Cancel your flight.

03:32.168 --> 03:34.866
Please? I can't run
this place alone.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.303
Caroline needs me with her
whilst we figure out

03:36.346 --> 03:37.956
how to get Alaric
and the girls back.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.436
Caroline can call Bonnie.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.351
I need you here more.

03:41.395 --> 03:45.007
You and I together in the same
place is not a good idea.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.226
Strictly professional.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.315
I need your brain.

03:48.358 --> 03:49.533
Listen.

03:51.318 --> 03:54.451
"The sins of the father
will be visited upon

03:54.495 --> 03:56.279
the daughters here
and not here."

03:56.323 --> 03:57.889
That's a piece
of the Sphinx's prophecy.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.587
He's talking about
the prison world.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.197
Maybe not.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.894
Prophecies are like
horoscopes-- purposely vague

04:02.938 --> 04:04.548
so you can apply them
to almost anything.

04:05.767 --> 04:08.770
"A new hero rises...

04:08.813 --> 04:11.555
but can be felled
by the golden arrow?"

04:11.599 --> 04:12.991
That isn't sounding
that vague to me.

04:13.035 --> 04:14.471
Then I suppose
you'll just have to keep

04:14.515 --> 04:16.865
any new heroes from rising
until I return.

04:16.908 --> 04:19.433
See, the thing about
foretelling the future is,

04:19.476 --> 04:20.912
it can wait.

04:20.956 --> 04:23.654
I would feel so much better

04:23.698 --> 04:26.483
if you were here with me.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.486
I'm sorry.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.881
But I have to go.

04:47.025 --> 04:48.766
Or maybe I can catch
the next flight.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.300
Enough with the
illusion spells, Alyssa.

05:00.343 --> 05:03.259
Tell me where
the ascendant is.

05:04.913 --> 05:07.568
Why isn't my truth spell
working?

05:07.611 --> 05:10.614
Hmm, I guess that anti-charm
potion I took is working.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.007
It is.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.225
Too bad-- you could use

05:13.269 --> 05:14.618
a little charm.

05:14.662 --> 05:17.839
Enough with the
games, Alyssa.

05:17.882 --> 05:19.928
Help me bring
the Saltzmans back.

05:19.971 --> 05:22.147
Why, so you can be the hero
and save the day?

05:25.063 --> 05:26.630
This isn't about you, Hope.

05:26.674 --> 05:27.936
Though, if I knew
how annoying you'd be,

05:27.979 --> 05:29.503
I would have sent you away, too.

05:29.546 --> 05:30.895
How's this?
You tell me

05:30.939 --> 05:33.507
where the real ascendant
is, and I won't

05:33.550 --> 05:35.378
pluck your eyelash extensions
out one by one.

05:35.422 --> 05:36.858
Sorry, but

05:36.901 --> 05:39.034
I don't negotiate
with basic witches.

05:39.077 --> 05:42.298
So, I'm never telling you
where the ascendant is.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.995
Namaste.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.301
♪ Hey, little voodoo child

05:45.345 --> 05:46.607
♪ You got me running wild

05:46.650 --> 05:48.696
♪ You make me feel alive

05:48.739 --> 05:50.393
♪ Ooh-ooh-ooh...♪

05:50.437 --> 05:52.787
I really don't get why
you run when we can vamp.

05:52.830 --> 05:55.137
The fresh air helps me
clear my head

05:55.180 --> 05:57.008
and be alone
with my thoughts.

05:57.052 --> 05:58.358
Or not.

05:58.401 --> 06:01.099
I wanted to talk
to you about Kym.

06:02.623 --> 06:03.711
She's, uh...

06:03.754 --> 06:04.886
uh, doing great

06:04.929 --> 06:06.148
as the library intern.

06:06.191 --> 06:07.367
Everyone loves her.

06:07.410 --> 06:09.804
"Everyone"?
Yeah.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.675
And you already know
how I feel about her, so

06:11.719 --> 06:13.547
I hope it won't come
off as too much

06:13.590 --> 06:15.810
of a surprise
if I tell you

06:15.853 --> 06:17.638
I want to ask her out.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.640
No, I'm not surprised.

06:19.683 --> 06:22.077
Disappointed but...

06:22.120 --> 06:23.905
not surprised.

06:23.948 --> 06:25.428
Come on, man,
don't be like that.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.256
I really like her.

06:27.299 --> 06:29.780
And I'm serious about
giving this a shot.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.303
You know me.

06:31.347 --> 06:33.523
I'll do right by her.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.264
So...

06:35.307 --> 06:37.266
I was hoping you could
give me some advice

06:37.309 --> 06:39.486
on putting together the
flyest first date ever

06:39.529 --> 06:41.531
with everything
that she loves.

06:43.272 --> 06:46.710
So... what-what does she love?

06:49.321 --> 06:50.671
You know what, MG?

06:50.714 --> 06:52.368
Who am I to stand in your way?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.588
Uh...

06:54.631 --> 06:57.199
Kym loves pool parties,

06:57.242 --> 06:59.244
chocolate-covered
strawberries,

06:59.288 --> 07:01.246
and, uh, frosé.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.510
Thanks, man.

07:03.553 --> 07:04.598
I owe you one.

07:04.641 --> 07:05.860
Yeah, then let that favor be you

07:05.903 --> 07:07.862
running
in the opposite direction.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.820
Fitness time is me time.

07:20.527 --> 07:21.963
LANDON:
Phoenix powers,

07:22.006 --> 07:23.921
activate!

07:26.968 --> 07:28.273
Damn, kid, get off of me!

07:30.711 --> 07:31.799
Not so fast!

07:31.842 --> 07:33.322
Ow, my wing!

07:33.365 --> 07:34.541
You idiot!

07:37.935 --> 07:39.154
No, no, don't-don't shoot!

07:48.990 --> 07:51.035
Who the hell are you?

07:52.254 --> 07:54.430
Really?

08:06.616 --> 08:08.618
You monsters.

08:08.662 --> 08:10.228
You have no idea

08:10.272 --> 08:11.969
how long it took me
to grow those.

08:12.013 --> 08:14.842
Well, next time it'll be
something that won't grow back,

08:14.885 --> 08:17.061
unless you tell us
why you're here.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.410
Do you serve Malivore?

08:18.454 --> 08:19.803
Or someone else?

08:19.847 --> 08:23.067
I serve the highest
power of all-- love.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.548
Where were you trying
to take my boyfriend?

08:25.592 --> 08:27.376
That guy's your boyfriend?

08:28.769 --> 08:30.161
Uh, I wasn't

08:30.205 --> 08:31.423
trying to take
him anywhere.

08:31.467 --> 08:32.729
He started it.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.078
Hey-- no, he... he
was flying around,

08:34.122 --> 08:35.471
shooting people...

08:35.515 --> 08:37.821
Yeah, with love arrows--
they're harmless!

08:37.865 --> 08:40.084
Check the quiver-- every
arrow in there only helps

08:40.128 --> 08:41.825
people express the
love they already

08:41.869 --> 08:43.958
feel inside.
Most people say thank you.

08:44.001 --> 08:46.569
Why didn't you come get me?

08:46.613 --> 08:48.049
Oh, I-I-I knew you
were busy with Alyssa.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.267
I was just trying to help.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.531
A hero the likes of which

08:51.574 --> 08:53.533
I haven't seen since Hercules.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.056
Would you just stay
out of it, please?

08:55.099 --> 08:56.971
Love to, thanks.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.452
You're not going
anywhere.

09:00.496 --> 09:02.933
That's a barrier spell.

09:02.977 --> 09:05.588
Think of it
like a force field.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.808
Your girlfriend's
kind of impressive.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.592
You're lucky that I
found you when I did.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.246
Wade said that you were
outside, trying to fly?

09:11.289 --> 09:13.901
Yeah.
It seemed more reasonable

09:13.944 --> 09:15.598
than it sounds
coming out of your mouth.

09:15.642 --> 09:16.947
Look, I know that
you wanted to help.

09:16.991 --> 09:18.601
But if you keep trying
to be the hero,

09:18.645 --> 09:20.342
one day I'm gonna have
to choose between saving you

09:20.385 --> 09:22.170
and stopping something
terrible from happening.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.389
And I don't want to think
about what that day looks like.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.003
What does this say?

09:29.046 --> 09:30.613
Uh, "puppy love."

09:30.657 --> 09:31.614
Well, that's
the modern translation.

09:31.658 --> 09:32.659
In Greek it's more like...

09:32.702 --> 09:34.312
Don't care.
What about this one?

09:34.356 --> 09:35.705
"Self love."

09:35.749 --> 09:37.533
I call it the Narcissus.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.014
Still want to help?Absolutely.

09:40.057 --> 09:42.669
Okay, think you can handle
the Cupid problem?
Hey, hey.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.845
What Cupid problem?
HOPE:
Exactly.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.108
Just watch him
till I get back, okay?

09:48.196 --> 09:50.111
And if you want
to prove that

09:50.154 --> 09:52.766
you mean us no harm--
what's the strongest one

09:52.809 --> 09:54.942
of those you've got,
to melt the coldest,

09:54.985 --> 09:56.247
bitchiest heart?

10:08.869 --> 10:10.697
Don't tell me you've had
a change of heart.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.742
No, but you're about to.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.744
Hope, wait...

10:29.193 --> 10:31.543
Can I tell you
a secret?

10:33.154 --> 10:35.896
I have a crush.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.941
On who?

10:42.598 --> 10:45.122
Hey, I'm sure you look great,
no need to stress.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.385
I have an amazing pool day
planned for us.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.910
I'm not stressing
about my outfit.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.346
I know I look good.

10:51.389 --> 10:52.869
It's just that

10:52.913 --> 10:54.566
I have this thing
with pools.

10:54.610 --> 10:57.744
Kaleb pushed me in the deep end
at the neighborhood pool

10:57.787 --> 10:58.962
when I was,
like, ten.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.834
The lifeguard
saved me, but

11:00.877 --> 11:02.574
I've had a phobia ever since.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.055
So I've been sitting
in here, trying to

11:05.099 --> 11:06.535
gather my nerves.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.931
How do you feel about
chocolate-covered strawberries?

11:10.974 --> 11:12.149
I'm allergic to both.

11:12.193 --> 11:14.151
Why?
And frosé?

11:14.195 --> 11:16.197
I guess there's a first time
for everything.

11:17.241 --> 11:19.156
HOPE:
Kym. Hi.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.505
Just the girl I
was looking for.

11:20.549 --> 11:21.506
I-I need your help
with some research

11:21.550 --> 11:23.595
on a new
monster-- Cupid?

11:23.639 --> 11:25.423
Oh, my God. Cupid?

11:25.467 --> 11:27.338
Also known as Eros,
depending on if you prefer

fix your relationship woes?

12:39.367 --> 12:42.152
I don't have

Come on.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.072
We're both stuck here; the least

Oh. Have you tried
both not wearing pants?

13:13.575 --> 13:15.620
It's very freeing.

13:15.664 --> 13:18.058

Stop messing with your ear,
I'm getting feedback.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.318
I can't help it. This
enchantment itches like crazy.

14:01.362 --> 14:03.886
The faster that you can seduce
Alyssa into telling you where

14:03.930 --> 14:06.410

that you can get out of there.

now talk about that.

How am I supposed to just
bring that up, Hope?

are to die for. Delicious.

14:18.379 --> 14:22.252
Almost
as delicious as French Bulldogs.

Okay, you know what, maybe
I'm good without the backup.

the Saltzmans' lives.

Um, how about we play a game?

14:39.400 --> 14:42.751
Like Marco Polo?

14:42.794 --> 14:44.448
I was thinking
something more like

14:44.492 --> 14:46.407
if I had

14:46.450 --> 14:48.365
a special object that I needed

14:48.409 --> 14:51.281
to hide somewhere,
where should I put it?

14:51.325 --> 14:54.589
Hmm... that's lame.

long I can hold my breath for?

14:57.548 --> 14:59.420

as-as powerful as she is,

you're looking for.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.503
Hero worship.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.246
No. I want

15:43.290 --> 15:45.205
what she feels for me
to be real.Hey, hey,

my-my arrows are
the real deal, kid.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.471
Okay, I just mean
I want to earn it.

15:53.909 --> 15:56.042
Uh, s-sorry, bud,

have ceilings?

16:00.046 --> 16:01.221
No?

16:07.618 --> 16:10.926
Two can play at that game.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.322
Damn it.

16:20.805 --> 16:22.982
Thank you all for coming.

16:23.025 --> 16:25.897
I hereby bring this meeting
of the Super Squad to order.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.205
Now, I know
what you're thinking--

16:29.249 --> 16:31.686
we're not heroes,

16:31.729 --> 16:33.340
and you're right, but

16:33.383 --> 16:35.124
I believe that
we can join together

16:35.168 --> 16:39.259
and equal one
relatively capable hero.

16:39.302 --> 16:42.653
Is this supposed
to be motivational

16:42.697 --> 16:44.394
or...?
Shh.

16:44.438 --> 16:45.830
It's time us to step up.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.745
Show our
non-believing peers

16:47.789 --> 16:49.965
and our mysteriously absent
authority figures

16:50.009 --> 16:51.749
who we really are

16:51.793 --> 16:53.969
by charging headfirst
into our destiny.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.492
And today

16:55.536 --> 16:58.017
our destiny
is getting Cupid back

16:58.060 --> 17:00.976
before Hope finds out
that I lost him.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.413
Yeah.

17:03.457 --> 17:06.938
All that, but my destiny
is somewhere else.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.854
And I got to go find her.

17:14.120 --> 17:17.079
Okay. Uh, that's fine,

17:17.123 --> 17:20.517
but the rest of us are still in,
right? Wade? Pedro?

17:20.561 --> 17:22.737
Yeah, you believed in me,
so I can believe in you.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.567
As long as we're back
before snack time.

17:27.872 --> 17:30.832
Oh, obviously. Um, and... you?

17:32.399 --> 17:33.965
Druscilla?

17:34.009 --> 17:36.968
Right. Can you do a locator
spell with those wings?

17:37.012 --> 17:39.014
Sure.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.364
Can I keep them after?

17:41.408 --> 17:42.496
Um...

17:42.539 --> 17:44.063
All yours.

17:44.106 --> 17:46.326
Now we just need to find Cupid
wherever he's making

17:46.369 --> 17:48.545
bridesmaids
wear 27 dresses

17:48.589 --> 17:50.939

planned for our second.

Wade, you still
can't see anything?

22:43.927 --> 22:45.799
Yeah, it's-it's that arrow.I thought the research

22:45.842 --> 22:48.062
said that that the magic would
wear off after we killed him.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.023
Uh, about that.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.467
Looks like Cupid flew the coop.

23:12.042 --> 23:14.262
ALYSSA:
Phesmatos oculacs.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.225
Thanks, Alyssa.
You're amazing.

23:21.269 --> 23:22.618
It's Lizzie Saltzman,

23:22.662 --> 23:24.185
isn't it?
Hmm?

23:24.228 --> 23:26.317
The other woman
that's in the way of you and me.

23:26.361 --> 23:27.971
Uh, no, I'm over Lizzie.

23:28.015 --> 23:30.452
But you chased
after her for years,

23:30.496 --> 23:32.498
even when I was here all along.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.325
Weren't you just with Jed?

23:34.369 --> 23:36.023
He's a booty howl.

23:36.066 --> 23:38.504
But you-- you're the kind
of guy a girl

23:38.547 --> 23:41.420
could settle down with forever.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.683
Uh, th-that's just
my natural vampire smolder.

23:43.726 --> 23:45.249
I'll tone that down.Or don't.

23:45.293 --> 23:46.250
Uh...

23:47.295 --> 23:50.429
Uh, I'm into somebody new.

23:51.604 --> 23:53.214
Well, that's convenient.

23:53.257 --> 23:54.737
Who?

23:54.781 --> 23:56.522
Some slutty werewolf in Canada?

23:56.565 --> 24:00.395
I don't like
being lied to.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.876
No, it's Kym.

24:02.919 --> 24:04.704
The intern?

24:04.747 --> 24:08.055
And she has nothing to
do with the ascendant.

24:08.098 --> 24:10.013
So,

24:10.057 --> 24:12.538
it was never gonna be me?

24:12.581 --> 24:15.062
I'm sorry, Alyssa.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.633
But can we still be friends?

24:32.253 --> 24:34.342
No, thanks.

24:34.385 --> 24:36.649
I don't have friends.

24:43.220 --> 24:45.179
WADE:
Are you sure the research said

24:45.222 --> 24:47.398
that Cupid's weakness
was his arrows?

24:47.442 --> 24:49.531
Look, Kym said it was
basically the one constant

24:49.575 --> 24:51.968
across every version
of the Cupid mythos.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.274
Well, it wouldn't be
the first time the legends

24:53.317 --> 24:54.536
got something wrong, though.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.886
What if we got
the monster wrong?

24:57.931 --> 24:59.933
Didn't Cupid have siblings?

25:02.065 --> 25:03.719
The Erotes.

25:03.763 --> 25:06.026
Each representing a different
type of love and attraction.

25:06.069 --> 25:07.549
Each one
with a different weakness.

25:07.593 --> 25:08.942
Oh, God.

25:08.985 --> 25:11.205
Gods. Plural. Seven of them.

25:14.077 --> 25:15.818
Okay.

25:17.037 --> 25:18.995
Okay, I guess we got to...

25:19.039 --> 25:21.215
Come on.

25:29.005 --> 25:30.311
What happened?

25:30.354 --> 25:32.792
I-I-I tried to
stick to the plan,

25:32.835 --> 25:34.010
but once you were gone...

25:34.054 --> 25:36.012
This is why I do
everything myself.

25:36.056 --> 25:38.406
Except it wasn't you
making out with her.

25:38.449 --> 25:41.061
And it wasn't you
manipulating her.

25:41.104 --> 25:42.758
But it doesn't matter.

25:42.802 --> 25:45.544
Alyssa-- she-she went insane.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.067
She's not just
in love with me,

25:47.110 --> 25:49.809
it's like she was obsessed.

25:49.852 --> 25:52.986
That's the arrow that Cupid gave
me to use on her. Obsession.

25:53.029 --> 25:55.466
Like boiling-bunnies,
burn-your-house-down obsession?

25:55.510 --> 25:57.120
That's not
romance, Hope.

25:57.164 --> 25:58.818
That's a whole different
movie genre.

25:58.861 --> 26:01.255
I just-- I grabbed
the strongest one I could find.

26:02.517 --> 26:04.345
Then I guess we both messed up.

26:04.388 --> 26:06.216
I told Alyssa

26:06.260 --> 26:08.001
that I'm into Kym.

26:08.044 --> 26:09.785
Go. I'll take care of this.

26:36.725 --> 26:37.944
Hey.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.075
I'll never get used to that.

26:39.119 --> 26:40.468
Hey! Pack it up!

26:40.511 --> 26:41.643
What's wrong?Clear out! Let's go!

26:41.687 --> 26:42.862
Let's get out of here.

26:42.905 --> 26:43.993
What's wrong?Your boy Cupid wasn't

26:44.037 --> 26:45.691
so angelic after all.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.127
Dude's got a bloodlust that
even I can't compete with.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.390
Okay? We got to get out of here.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.087
Kym. Sweet,
you're okay.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.263
I'll explain later, but I
got to get you out of here.

26:53.307 --> 26:55.135
Oh, she's not going
anywhere with you.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.311
I saw you on that date.

26:57.354 --> 26:59.182
The date that you ruined?Ruined?

26:59.226 --> 27:01.315
It didn't look so ruined with
you vamping your tongue down

27:01.358 --> 27:02.490
Alyssa Chang's throat.

27:02.533 --> 27:03.491
What?

27:03.534 --> 27:05.145
That is not how it happened.

27:05.188 --> 27:07.887
That was a part of an
incredibly poorly-thought-out

27:07.930 --> 27:09.018
but well-intentioned plan.

27:09.062 --> 27:10.280
KALEB:
Mm-hmm.

27:10.324 --> 27:12.195
Yeah, you see this?
This is exactly why

27:12.239 --> 27:13.675
I didn't want you two dating.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.111
We can talk about this later,
but right now

27:15.155 --> 27:17.636
we got to jet, man. Come on.

27:20.856 --> 27:23.380
Morabor.

27:25.339 --> 27:27.471
Sorry.

27:27.515 --> 27:29.430
This is between us girls.

27:34.130 --> 27:35.741
I thought I killed you.

27:35.784 --> 27:38.047
No, you thought
you killed Cupid.

27:38.091 --> 27:39.919
But I am

27:39.962 --> 27:43.879
his taller, hotter, cooler,
older brother Pothos.

27:45.228 --> 27:47.013
Can't imagine

27:47.056 --> 27:49.798
that Burning Love arrow
feels too good, does it?

27:52.192 --> 27:53.584
It burns you from the inside out

27:53.628 --> 27:55.282
until your whole body
is reduced to ash.

27:56.762 --> 27:59.895
Save for your juicy,
delicious heart.

28:03.072 --> 28:04.291
LANDON:
Hey!

28:04.334 --> 28:05.292
Eat me instead.

28:08.382 --> 28:09.644
POTHOS:
A weak

28:09.688 --> 28:11.777
loser heart
or badass witch heart

28:11.820 --> 28:13.387
tenderized by one of my arrows?

28:15.868 --> 28:17.696
I'm good, thanks.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.872
How about now?

28:30.534 --> 28:32.058
Can we talk about this
like the mature women we are?

28:32.101 --> 28:34.495
Okay, let's talk.

28:34.538 --> 28:36.845
Do you know how long
I've waited for MG

28:36.889 --> 28:38.368
to pay attention to me?

28:38.412 --> 28:41.415
And then you show up and
sweep him off his feet?

28:41.458 --> 28:43.896
A human?
Like, have standards, MG.

28:48.378 --> 28:50.554
Shoot your shot, then. MG's
apparently open for business.

28:50.598 --> 28:52.295
We've never even been on a date.

28:52.339 --> 28:53.775
Our date was amazing.

28:53.819 --> 28:54.994
Until he said that
he doesn't want me.

28:55.037 --> 28:56.865
He wants you.

29:07.267 --> 29:08.921
So, if I can't
have him,

29:08.964 --> 29:11.227
no one can.

29:14.274 --> 29:15.449
It was fun while it lasted.

29:22.021 --> 29:23.413
Kaleb.
Kym, you all right?

29:23.457 --> 29:24.414
Okay, it's okay.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.590
You got her.
You got her.

29:34.685 --> 29:36.557
Epic love arrow.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.081
You brought out
the big guns.That's right.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.735
Well, you've never eaten
a heart as full of love

29:40.779 --> 29:42.041
as mine is for her.

29:42.084 --> 29:43.390
Is that why you were unloading

29:43.433 --> 29:44.913
all your relationship problems
on me?

29:44.957 --> 29:46.828
That stuff I said
doesn't matter.

29:46.872 --> 29:49.396
The love that Hope and I have
for each other is more than

29:49.439 --> 29:51.790
I ever dreamed of finding
in my lifetime.

29:53.966 --> 29:55.402
More than I even thought
was possible.

29:55.445 --> 29:57.926
The only problem
with our relationship

29:57.970 --> 30:00.189
is that I have no idea why
she picked a guy like me

30:00.233 --> 30:01.495
in the first place.

30:01.538 --> 30:03.105
POTHOS:
That's just
my arrow talking.

30:03.149 --> 30:05.107
Is it?

30:05.151 --> 30:07.675
I don't really feel
the difference.

30:07.718 --> 30:09.503
I already love Hope Mikaelson

30:09.546 --> 30:11.853
with all my heart.
I don't want to
live without her.

30:11.897 --> 30:15.074
So if you're going to kill her,
you need to kill me, too.

30:16.162 --> 30:17.337
POTHOS:
If you insist.

30:21.341 --> 30:23.125
Landon, no!

30:41.317 --> 30:43.102
Don't worry.

30:43.145 --> 30:45.017
You're next.

31:09.345 --> 31:11.826
Your boyfriend's smarter
than he looks.

31:41.334 --> 31:42.378
Hey.

31:42.422 --> 31:43.553
Hey.Hope.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.947
Hi.You're okay.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.080
It worked.

31:48.123 --> 31:50.778
Yeah, your plan to get your
heart eaten in front of me?

31:50.821 --> 31:52.432
Yeah, it worked.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.522
What did you do?

31:55.565 --> 31:56.958
After you left the bar,

31:57.002 --> 31:58.699
we figured out
that wasn't actually Cupid.

31:58.742 --> 32:01.441
It was one
of the other gods of love.

32:01.484 --> 32:03.399
Yeah, you know, I learned
that the hard way

32:03.443 --> 32:05.227
when Pothos
introduced himself to me.

32:05.271 --> 32:08.404
Oh. You were one step
ahead of us, then.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.972
We just knew that they each had
a different weakness, so I ate

32:11.016 --> 32:13.279
sheep's brain, um, hemlock,

32:13.322 --> 32:14.889
molten silver,

32:14.933 --> 32:17.413
yew bark,
red wine and...

32:17.457 --> 32:18.806
devil's ivy,

32:18.849 --> 32:20.939
a toxic plant
otherwise known as...

32:20.982 --> 32:22.505
pothos.

32:24.072 --> 32:26.118
Guess that was the one.

32:26.161 --> 32:28.424
You did all that to save me?

32:28.468 --> 32:31.906
I'd do it again
and again and again...

32:31.950 --> 32:34.126
Okay, show-off.

32:37.564 --> 32:39.522

35:46.666 --> 35:49.625
MG is not into you.

35:49.669 --> 35:51.105
And you trying
to get with him

35:51.149 --> 35:52.889
almost got my sister
killed today.

35:52.933 --> 35:55.631
So find yourself a new crush.

35:59.069 --> 36:01.463
I'll get right on that.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.164
Yeah.

36:20.700 --> 36:23.398
Hey.

36:26.358 --> 36:30.840
I should probably schedule a
session with Jed about this.

36:30.884 --> 36:32.364
So...

36:32.407 --> 36:35.541
are we married or not?

36:39.022 --> 36:41.329
You know, I always thought
Ric would be my best man.

36:41.373 --> 36:43.244
We're going to get him back.

36:43.288 --> 36:44.506
Yeah.

36:44.550 --> 36:45.986
The Cupid thing just...

36:46.029 --> 36:47.814
got us all a little...Distracted.

36:47.857 --> 36:49.642
Exactly.You know, was that
the outcome,

36:49.685 --> 36:51.426
or was that his intention?

36:51.470 --> 36:53.994
Thank Queen Mab, you're here.What's wrong?

36:54.037 --> 36:56.083
Well, with you and Mr.
Williams off campus,

36:56.126 --> 36:57.693
and as student
security supervisor,

36:57.737 --> 36:59.608
I was notified of a breach
in the protection spell

36:59.652 --> 37:00.827
surrounding the school...

37:02.742 --> 37:05.788
Someone broke
into the weapons armory.

37:05.832 --> 37:07.486
What did they take?

37:09.531 --> 37:10.967
Junk.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.535
Junk!

37:13.579 --> 37:16.886
Junk! Why'd we waste our time

37:16.930 --> 37:20.281
stealing all this junk
again, Chad?

37:20.325 --> 37:21.935
Chad?

37:25.330 --> 37:27.157
What took you so long?

37:27.201 --> 37:29.029
I had to wait until
they buried him.

37:29.072 --> 37:31.031
Then I had to
dig him up.Excuses.

37:31.074 --> 37:34.034
Always excuses!

37:35.949 --> 37:38.473
Just put him
with the Sphinx.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.086
CHAD:
Hey.

37:44.914 --> 37:46.176
Isn't that
that thing

37:46.220 --> 37:47.743
Pothos said he wanted
in exchange

37:47.787 --> 37:49.528
for distracting
the Salvatore kids?

37:49.571 --> 37:52.270
The Golden Arrow.

37:58.363 --> 38:00.321
Good job, Chad.

38:00.365 --> 38:01.322
Yeah.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.068
Don't touch it.

38:23.083 --> 38:24.824
LANDON:
Hey.

38:24.867 --> 38:26.782
Hey.

38:26.826 --> 38:28.436
Am I interrupting something?

38:28.480 --> 38:30.177
Just me, um,

38:30.220 --> 38:33.311
trying and failing to find a way
to bring the Saltzmans back.

38:35.835 --> 38:38.446
Look, I know I've...

38:38.490 --> 38:41.797
been reluctant
to let you step up.

38:43.582 --> 38:46.759
But obviously
you can handle yourself.

38:49.544 --> 38:51.981
Besides, I don't have
all the answers either.

38:53.026 --> 38:54.854
Hey.

38:55.898 --> 38:57.639
Don't worry.

38:57.683 --> 38:59.772
We won't give up until we
find a way to get 'em back.

39:02.470 --> 39:04.298
Did you mean what you said

39:04.342 --> 39:07.606
about not knowing
why I picked you?

39:09.695 --> 39:11.653
Oh, uh...

39:11.697 --> 39:13.655
I-I mean...

39:16.615 --> 39:18.747
Maybe.

39:18.791 --> 39:20.575
Sometimes.

39:41.074 --> 39:43.293
What is this?

39:43.337 --> 39:45.339
Oh, just... read it.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.428
I wrote it when I got back.

39:49.909 --> 39:52.868
"He's so patient...

39:52.912 --> 39:54.914
"and trusting and kind,

39:54.957 --> 39:57.395
and a thousand other things
I never was."

39:58.613 --> 40:00.920
"So, if all I ever have
is the memory

40:00.963 --> 40:03.444
"of the way he loved me,

40:03.488 --> 40:06.578
then I will
survive this."
