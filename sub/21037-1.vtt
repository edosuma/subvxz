You have worked
so hard for the last six weeks,

00:51.585 --> 00:53.554
for a lot of reasons!

00:53.587 --> 00:55.089
Let's be honest, you want
to look good in the dress,

00:55.123 --> 00:56.090
am I right?

00:56.124 --> 00:57.291

00:59.560 --> 01:01.762
But, as I promised,

01:01.795 --> 01:04.232
this class has been about
so much more

01:04.265 --> 01:05.498
than just the outside.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.669
It has been
about the inside as well.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.417
[Daniel]: Sure is.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.586
My fiancé signed me up
as a surprise,

01:25.619 --> 01:26.887
but he did not tell me
what it was.

It's one of

01:32.560 --> 01:33.661
Really? She was?

01:33.694 --> 01:34.795
Oh, yeah.
She combines

01:34.828 --> 01:35.996
exercise with yoga

01:36.029 --> 01:39.200
and lessons about things like
sharing and communication.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.569
She even has the grooms attend
several of the sessions

01:41.602 --> 01:42.903
so they can work together
as a couple.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.638

-Just hard.
-Right.

05:06.474 --> 05:07.441
Well, it wasn't your fault!

05:07.475 --> 05:08.976
I was
a marriage counselor,

05:09.009 --> 05:10.878
and I didn't recognize
that the guy I was gonna marry

05:10.911 --> 05:12.580
didn't actually
want to get married.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.015
That's like "Relationship 101."

05:15.048 --> 05:17.551
Okay. So what was the class

05:17.585 --> 05:19.453
where they taught you
about letting go of the past,

05:19.487 --> 05:21.021
and forgiving yourself?

05:21.054 --> 05:23.090
I did. I am.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.325
I'm working on it.

You know, this is why
I do what I do now.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.634

is about

05:33.667 --> 05:34.868
solving problems
after they start,

05:34.902 --> 05:36.370
but the boot camp is about
fixing problems

05:36.404 --> 05:37.705
before they ever begin.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.674
Helps me just as much
as it helps my students,

so that, if I ever
do find myself

05:42.543 --> 05:44.712

16:47.207 --> 16:49.442
Smile? What?
Am I smiling?

16:49.476 --> 16:51.778
Okay, you are not
just smiling...

16:51.811 --> 16:53.380
you're swooning!

16:53.413 --> 16:54.581
You met a guy.

16:54.614 --> 16:55.582
Oh, I met a guy!

16:55.615 --> 16:57.084
Ah! [squeals]

16:57.117 --> 16:58.285
Tell me, tell me, tell me,
tell me!

16:58.318 --> 17:00.287
Well, his name is Nick.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.255
I like it. One-syllable names
are very in right now.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.324
Okay, and he is a photographer.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.526
Okay. Interesting.
Artistic.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.494
And he's really funny, witty,

17:08.528 --> 17:09.628
the fast-on-his-feet
kinda guy, you know?

17:09.662 --> 17:10.630
A sense of humor is crucial.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.799
But you're leaving out
the most important part.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.334
What's the most important part?

17:14.367 --> 17:15.167
Is he cute?

17:15.202 --> 17:17.470
That is not
the most important part.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.309
But, yeah, he's really cute.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.609
[both laughing]

17:27.380 --> 17:29.782
I am so excited
about this class.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.451
My friend, Becky, took it
and she said

17:31.484 --> 17:34.254
it is the absolute best ever,

17:34.287 --> 17:36.223
like, life-altering.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.591
Oh, I'm Quinn,
by the way.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.459
Lisa.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.460
Claire.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.428
Mike...

17:41.461 --> 17:43.196
Mike?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.565
That... is different.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.200
What? Oh, no.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.568
Mike is my assistant

17:48.601 --> 17:50.470
who can't follow
simple instructions.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.371
I'm Abby.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.839
Hi.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.874
[Quinn]: So, how did you
find out about this class?

17:54.907 --> 17:56.643
It was
my fiancé's idea.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.811
He thinks I work too much.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.315
Oh.

18:02.349 --> 18:05.452
And, um, what about you?

18:05.485 --> 18:07.854
Molly threatened to call
our parents if I didn't join.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.656
Oh, I-- I heard she was tough,
but...

18:09.689 --> 18:10.523
No, no, no.

18:10.557 --> 18:11.624
Molly's my sister.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.692
Your sister?

18:12.725 --> 18:14.294
-We're in trouble.
-Why?

18:14.327 --> 18:15.895
Because she's gonna try
to get you back

18:15.928 --> 18:17.497
for everything
you did to her as a kid.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.367
Hey, everyone!
I'm Molly White,

18:20.400 --> 18:23.436
and we're gonna get started
in just a few minutes,

18:23.470 --> 18:25.138
so claim a space,
stretch out,

18:25.172 --> 18:26.639
get ready to work.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.775
Hey, um, just a reminder...

18:28.808 --> 18:30.677
I have to take it easy today
because of my back.

18:30.710 --> 18:31.811
There's nothing
wrong with your back.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.213
Yes, there is.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.114
No, I-I've got a problem
with my discs.

18:36.349 --> 18:37.817
That's a thing, right?

18:37.850 --> 18:38.785
Go stretch.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.253
You look
really pretty today.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.721
-Stretch!
-Okay.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.857
Yeah, we're in trouble.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.430
[quietly] Nick?

18:53.600 --> 18:56.736
Uh, just hang on,
I'll be back in just a second.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.907
[music playing in background]

19:05.278 --> 19:06.379
Molly!

19:06.413 --> 19:08.481
This is that friend
of my sister's.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.217
Jenna, this is Molly.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.618
She does the Bridal Boot Camp.

19:11.651 --> 19:12.719
Hi, Molly.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.654
I really appreciate
you squeezing me in.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.489
Yeah, no problem.
We're about to get started,

19:16.523 --> 19:18.358
so why don't you
head on down, okay?

19:18.391 --> 19:19.492
Oh, let me just introduce
you to my fiancé.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.593
Just really,
really quick, okay?

19:20.627 --> 19:21.894
Hey, Nick, sweetie?

19:21.928 --> 19:24.364
Nick...

19:25.565 --> 19:27.234
Oh. Yeah.

19:36.809 --> 19:40.713
Nick, this is Molly.
Molly, this is my fiancé.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.215
[Nick]: Small world, huh?

19:42.249 --> 19:43.683
It's, yeah, it's tiny.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.852
It's microscopic,
as a matter of fact.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.488
Yeah, we met at Brendan
and Elizabeth's wedding.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.490
Right, but, we--

19:50.523 --> 19:53.360
We danced. I guess
you could call it that.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.461
You danced
with my fiancé?

19:54.494 --> 19:56.863
Yes. Uh... we-- I--

19:56.896 --> 19:58.531
[stammering]

19:58.565 --> 20:00.633
It was
Elizabeth's fault!

20:00.667 --> 20:01.934
Oh, no, no, no!
I am so sorry.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.603
I have seen
Nick dance.

20:03.636 --> 20:04.804
It is not pretty.

20:04.837 --> 20:05.838
Right!

20:05.872 --> 20:07.240
Two left feet.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.741
Two left feet!
[laughs]

20:08.775 --> 20:09.609
I'm standing right here, guys.

20:09.642 --> 20:10.710
I can hear everything
you're saying.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.379
It's not lost on me.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.646
Aw, sweetheart.
I'm so, so sorry,

20:13.680 --> 20:14.714
but you are good
at other things.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.616
Yeah.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.251
So you two met,

20:18.285 --> 20:19.452
and now here we are.
Isn't that funny?

20:19.486 --> 20:20.453
It's funny.

20:20.487 --> 20:21.354
Yeah, it is.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.022
Since we're both
in the bridal business,

20:23.055 --> 20:24.924
we thought we would maybe
share some clients.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.259
That's great.
See, I told you

20:26.293 --> 20:27.260
that talk with my father
would help.

20:27.294 --> 20:28.428
Look at you,
networking!

20:28.461 --> 20:29.529
Please, don't start
with that.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.598
I keep trying
to convince him

20:31.631 --> 20:32.865
to join my father's
investment firm.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.434
And then I remind her

20:34.467 --> 20:36.035
that I know nothing
about investment banking,

20:36.068 --> 20:38.538
because I am
a photographer.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.606
Yeah, I know,

20:39.639 --> 20:40.840
and you're really,
really great at it,

20:40.873 --> 20:42.008
it's just, when it
comes to business...

20:42.041 --> 20:44.344
Yeah, I'm even worse at that
than I am dancing, it's true.

20:44.377 --> 20:45.812
[laughs]

20:45.845 --> 20:47.547
So, Molly?
Time for class?

20:47.580 --> 20:48.881
Yeah. Yeah. Uh...

20:48.915 --> 20:50.617
Let's head in.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.818
'Kay, great, I'll pick
you up in an hour?

20:51.851 --> 20:53.019
Yeah. Okay. Bye.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.622
Bye. Molly, it was
great to see you again.

20:55.655 --> 20:56.823
Let's do that coffee.

20:56.856 --> 20:57.824
Let's see if
we can make this work.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.058
Yeah, great. I love coffee.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.327
No, you don't!

21:00.360 --> 21:01.328
-I do.
-Hey, can we have a chat?

21:01.361 --> 21:02.529
Yeah, yeah.
Absolutely.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.364
Bye!

21:08.401 --> 21:09.502
Hi.

21:09.536 --> 21:10.970
[indistinct exchanges]

21:11.003 --> 21:12.539
Hi, everyone, again.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.006
I am Molly White.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.443
And let's get started
on your boot camp!

21:16.476 --> 21:18.678
Bridal Boot Camp.

21:18.711 --> 21:21.481
Because you are all brides...

21:21.514 --> 21:23.916
Getting married
to great guys.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.952
I'm presuming
they're great guys.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.053
Haven't met them. Met yours.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.656
And he seems great.

21:29.689 --> 21:30.690
He is.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.559
[all chuckling]

21:32.592 --> 21:35.628
Okay. Uh...

21:35.662 --> 21:38.030
As you know,
this is a six-week course

21:38.064 --> 21:39.966
and, every week,
we are going to focus on

21:39.999 --> 21:41.768
one of six core principles--

21:41.801 --> 21:42.869
trust,

21:42.902 --> 21:45.672
communication, honesty,

21:45.705 --> 21:46.839
commitment,

21:46.873 --> 21:50.109
sharing,
and forgiveness.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.811
Now, sometimes,
it's going to be just us,

21:51.844 --> 21:53.380
and other times

21:53.413 --> 21:55.515
we'll invite your fiancés.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.584
Nick gets
to come to class?

21:57.617 --> 21:58.685
Oh!

21:58.718 --> 21:59.752
Yeah.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.454
Yes.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.122
That--
That'll be fun.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.957
So much fun.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.092
Um...

22:06.125 --> 22:07.860
[stammering] Anyway!

22:07.894 --> 22:09.396
You are going to learn.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.564
You are going to work hard.

22:11.598 --> 22:15.835
And you are going
to be amazing.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.770
Grab yourselves a Swiss ball.

22:17.804 --> 22:21.040
Let's get started!

22:24.010 --> 22:25.812
Oh, wow. That was...

22:25.845 --> 22:27.013
Hard.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.748
-That was...
-That was hard.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.016
I think I need
an ambulance.

22:30.049 --> 22:30.983
[whimper-chuckle]

22:31.017 --> 22:31.884
You're laughing.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.986
I think I literally
need an ambulance.

22:35.588 --> 22:36.956
That was a great
workout, Molly.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.391
Thanks!

22:38.425 --> 22:40.026
I cannot tell you
how much I appreciate

22:40.059 --> 22:41.027
you letting me join
at the last second.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.829
Happy to help.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.464
It probably could have waited.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.098
I mean, we've been dating
for a while now,

22:46.132 --> 22:47.834
but we've only been engaged
for a couple weeks,

22:47.867 --> 22:48.901
and we haven't even
picked a date yet,

22:48.935 --> 22:51.704
It's just, I'm going to do
everything that I can

22:51.738 --> 22:54.507
to make sure that we have
the perfect wedding.

22:56.175 --> 22:58.010
You know, sometimes,
it's the imperfections

22:58.044 --> 22:59.646
that make for
a really memorable wedding,

22:59.679 --> 23:02.114
and a more realistic marriage.

23:02.148 --> 23:03.950
Interesting.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.017
But I really think
that I can do it.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.153
My sister, Karen, got married
almost a month ago

23:07.186 --> 23:08.488
and our whole family
just thought

23:08.521 --> 23:09.889
that she had
the most perfect wedding,

23:09.922 --> 23:11.758
and I know that I can beat her.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.494
I don't think a wedding
should be a competition.

23:14.527 --> 23:15.828
There's Nick.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.897
Now, if I can just turn him
into the perfect groom

23:17.930 --> 23:20.467
before the ceremony,
everything should be a snap.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.168
Okay, I'll see you Thursday.
Bye.

23:22.201 --> 23:23.936
I'm just gonna shower
real quick, then we can go.

23:23.970 --> 23:24.971
Yeah, yeah, sure. Okay.

23:25.004 --> 23:25.972
I'll wait for you
right here.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.039
Okay.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.475
Hey, Molly? Molly!

23:28.508 --> 23:29.709
Want me to go get her?

23:29.742 --> 23:30.710
Yeah, do you mind?

23:30.743 --> 23:32.445
She's got, like, another class
in five minutes,

23:32.479 --> 23:33.580
and I need to man
the front desk.

23:33.613 --> 23:34.614
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, sure.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.048
-Okay.
-I'll be back in a minute.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.049
Hey.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.051
Molly!

23:40.887 --> 23:42.154
Molly!

23:42.188 --> 23:43.556
Hey, hey, hey!

23:43.590 --> 23:44.657
Molly.

23:44.691 --> 23:45.758
Hi!

23:45.792 --> 23:47.594
Did you not
hear me calling you?

23:47.627 --> 23:52.064
No, it's really loud out here
with the rain and boat traffic.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.165
[rain pattering lightly]

23:53.199 --> 23:55.167
Yeah... it's deafening.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.904
So, where are you off to
in the rain like this?

23:57.937 --> 24:00.673
Just, uh, just off.

24:00.707 --> 24:01.841
Well, Daniel asked me
to come and get you,

24:01.874 --> 24:03.676
because he said you have
another class in a few minutes.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.077
Yes. My class.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.979
This is what I like to do
in between my classes.

24:07.013 --> 24:07.980
I like to, um...

24:08.014 --> 24:10.216
get some fresh air
and keep my heart rate up.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.984
Great.

24:12.018 --> 24:14.120
Listen, you know, I don't want
to seem off-base, because,

24:14.153 --> 24:16.255
you know, we don't know
each other that well really,

24:16.288 --> 24:18.491
but you kind of seem like
something is bothering you.

24:18.525 --> 24:19.826
You sure you're okay?

24:19.859 --> 24:20.727
Yeah. I'm fine.

24:20.760 --> 24:21.861
Really?

24:23.996 --> 24:25.698
No.

24:25.732 --> 24:26.733
Okay, well, is it me?
Something that I did?

24:26.766 --> 24:28.267
No. No, no. No.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.202
Uh...

24:30.236 --> 24:31.538
When we met at the wedding--

24:31.571 --> 24:32.572
Yeah?

24:32.605 --> 24:33.773
I didn't know that...

24:35.241 --> 24:38.110
I didn't know
that you were engaged.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.879
Oh...

24:39.912 --> 24:42.081
Yeah.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.183
I-I can totally see
how you made that mistake.

24:44.216 --> 24:45.718
That is all my fault.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.620
No, no, no, no, no.
No. Sorry.

24:47.654 --> 24:49.889
It's not your fault.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.290
It's my fault.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.526
I just misinterpreted
the whole situation.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.862
I just thought
that you were...

24:55.895 --> 24:57.830
I mean, I thought
that we were kinda...

24:57.864 --> 24:59.532
I get that.
That was never my intention.

24:59.566 --> 25:00.567
I wish I had known

25:00.600 --> 25:02.702
that your fiancée was gonna
take my boot camp.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.537
In all honesty, I didn't know
until this morning either.

25:04.571 --> 25:05.738
She wanted to surprise me.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.039
I was surprised.

25:07.073 --> 25:07.907
I was surprised!

25:07.940 --> 25:09.041
[laughs]

25:09.075 --> 25:10.977
Hey, I really am sorry.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.579
Let's just
forget this--

25:12.612 --> 25:13.512
Okay.

25:13.546 --> 25:15.247
-...Ever happened!
-Okay. It's forgotten.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.082
Okay.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.850
You'll just come
to a couple classes,

25:17.884 --> 25:18.851
and then that'll be it.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.019
Actually,
you know what?

25:20.052 --> 25:21.621
Hey, Nick, did you
tell Molly the good news?

25:21.654 --> 25:22.622
What news?

25:22.655 --> 25:24.056
I hired Nick to do
a photo shoot for the gym.

25:24.090 --> 25:26.058
We're gonna redo the website,
new brochures...

25:26.092 --> 25:26.959
Everything!

25:26.993 --> 25:29.696
He's gonna be here
for the next few weeks.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.297
See? That's what
happens if you network!

25:31.330 --> 25:32.832
Turn you into
a business tycoon,

25:32.865 --> 25:33.900
if it kills me.

25:33.933 --> 25:36.335
[♪♪♪]

25:36.368 --> 25:38.838
[Nick]: Yep.

25:40.072 --> 25:43.275
[Jenna]: I think the job
at the gym is great, Nick.

25:43.309 --> 25:45.277
I mean, I still think
that my father's firm

25:45.311 --> 25:47.113
would be a really good thing
to have in your back pocket--

25:47.146 --> 25:49.215
[Nick]: Come on. How many times
do I have to tell you?

25:49.248 --> 25:51.017
I don't want to work
for your Dad's firm.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.252
Anyway, so, next week,

25:53.285 --> 25:54.320
we have our first
appointments

25:54.353 --> 25:55.788
to audition caterers,

25:55.822 --> 25:57.757
still got
to figure out a venue,

25:57.790 --> 25:59.258
and you probably want
to get fitted for your tux.

25:59.291 --> 26:00.259
Sure.
I can do that.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.227
But, no, you can't,

26:01.260 --> 26:03.262
because I need to find
my wedding dress first.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.164
That's what
I meant, bad idea.

26:05.197 --> 26:06.833
I mean, think
of it this way.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.000
It's a great way
to get used to the idea

26:08.034 --> 26:10.136
that my needs
always come first.

26:10.169 --> 26:12.104
I'm kidding,
sweetheart.

26:12.138 --> 26:14.907
Of course you are.

26:30.056 --> 26:32.091
So... how's it going in there?

26:32.124 --> 26:33.726
[Lisa]: Slowly.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.394
Why?

26:35.427 --> 26:38.364
Because somebody tortured me
in a workout class this morning

26:38.397 --> 26:41.000
and now I can't lift
my own arms over my head.

26:41.033 --> 26:42.034
Sorry.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.302
-No, you're not.
-No, I'm not.

26:43.335 --> 26:44.637
[chuckling]

26:44.671 --> 26:45.805
[Lisa]:
You know, one of these days,

26:45.838 --> 26:47.373
I'm gonna band the girls
together,

26:47.406 --> 26:49.709
and we will start
an uprising against you.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.410
I would expect
nothing less.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.045
And I think
I can get everyone.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.681
Except maybe Jenna,

26:54.714 --> 26:56.182
she'd definitely
be on your side.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.750
Oh, I don't know about that.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.886
Was that her fiancé
in the lobby this morning?

26:59.919 --> 27:01.954
Uh, yes.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.089
Nick.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.757
He's a wedding photographer.

27:04.791 --> 27:07.359
He's going to take
some photos of the gym.

27:07.393 --> 27:08.995
Coincidence.

27:09.028 --> 27:12.064
Isn't your wedding
photographer guy Nick, too?

27:14.867 --> 27:16.736
[scoffs]

27:16.769 --> 27:18.037
No!

27:18.070 --> 27:19.906
Molly, her Nick is your Nick?

27:19.939 --> 27:21.941
No, no, no.
He's not my Nick.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.442
And-And... [sighs]

27:23.475 --> 27:26.746
It was-- It was just
a big misunderstanding.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.047
Forgetting to tell you
he's engaged

27:28.080 --> 27:29.181
was a misunderstanding?

27:29.215 --> 27:30.116
Lisa, can we just drop it?

27:30.149 --> 27:31.884
Okay. Okay.

27:31.918 --> 27:33.319
I'm just saying,

27:33.352 --> 27:35.988
it's a little weird that
he calls it a misunderstanding.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.189
Just drop it, okay?

27:37.223 --> 27:39.959
Okay.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.729
[weary sigh]

27:42.762 --> 27:45.231

that dress or what?

Wow...

27:54.807 --> 27:56.776
It's good?

27:56.809 --> 27:58.477
It's perfect.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.611
It's expensive!

27:59.645 --> 28:02.749
I mean, it's one-of-a-kind,
so it's really expensive.

28:02.782 --> 28:05.151
Yes. Well,
it's worth it.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.218
I mean, honey,
look at you.

28:06.252 --> 28:08.387
It's perfect.
[gasps]

28:08.420 --> 28:10.222

Good morning.

29:29.035 --> 29:30.302
You're here.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.503
Well, I wanted to get

29:31.537 --> 29:33.906
a headstart
before your first class,

29:33.940 --> 29:36.042
and...
then I saw this...

29:36.075 --> 29:38.177
beautiful
photo board,

29:38.210 --> 29:39.245
which I love.

outside, too, huh?

the weather permits, yeah.

30:14.013 --> 30:15.915
Well, since you're doing
classes outside,

30:15.948 --> 30:17.416
maybe I should tag along
with Jenna's tomorrow.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.451
Well, uh, s-- sure, yeah.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.320

That's fine.

what is it, next week,

join the class?

some of the classes.

We can do aerobics together.

No. We do more
than just exercise.

how to be honest,

30:37.937 --> 30:39.271
and share.

30:39.305 --> 30:41.173
Right.
So you're incorporating

30:41.207 --> 30:43.009
the lessons you taught
as a marriage counselor

I was a marriage counselor?

30:49.081 --> 30:50.616
I read your bio
on the gym's website.

30:50.649 --> 30:53.185
But it didn't say

30:53.219 --> 30:54.620
why you made the transition.

I'm assuming

30:56.455 --> 30:58.190
that's the long story
that you were talking about?

That would be the one.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.061

tell me, are you?

you're a spy,

31:36.395 --> 31:38.164
and I'll start shooting
upstairs,

31:38.197 --> 31:39.531

-Okay.

started on anything!

31:58.250 --> 31:59.718
Look, she started it.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.121
Karen always had to be
the first at everything,

32:02.154 --> 32:04.556
so all I ever got
were her hand-me-downs.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.358
Karen may have had
the first wedding,

32:06.392 --> 32:08.260
but mine's going
to be the best.

32:08.294 --> 32:11.964
The competition between
you two guys is out of control.

32:11.998 --> 32:13.265
What do you mean?

32:13.299 --> 32:15.234
Well, you tried
to steal her thunder

32:15.267 --> 32:16.668
by getting up
at her wedding reception

32:16.702 --> 32:18.370
and announcing
our engagement.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.139
So?

32:20.172 --> 32:22.441
Well, I hadn't actually
proposed to you yet.

32:22.474 --> 32:23.709
Okay, maybe
I'm a little bit competitive,

32:23.742 --> 32:25.744
but it's not like
we hadn't talked about it.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.113
I mean, we have been
dating for a while.

32:27.146 --> 32:28.314
We knew that's
where we were going.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.216
Yeah, well,
we weren't there yet.

32:30.249 --> 32:32.451
I was,
and you got there.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.420
I mean, you proposed,
after all.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.554
Yes, I did.

32:35.587 --> 32:36.588
And I do want to marry you,

32:36.622 --> 32:38.424
but I think
we just need to back off

32:38.457 --> 32:40.159
on the whole
"perfect wedding" thing.

gonna find it here.

the carrot wedding cake.

different.

is a vegetarian, so...

anyways, now that we have
the cake settled,

to find my wedding dress.

of one-of-a-kind creations.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.101

That's really interesting.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.435
Thank you, Lisa!

33:23.469 --> 33:25.104
This is so great,
you know?

33:25.137 --> 33:27.239
All of us brides
working together,

33:27.273 --> 33:29.608
helping each other out,
sharing secrets.

33:29.641 --> 33:30.709
Please,
I'm not giving any of you

33:30.742 --> 33:33.279
the really good stuff
I've found for my ceremony.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.147
Yeah, no, me either.
I'm winning my wedding.

33:35.181 --> 33:36.715
[brides laughing]

33:36.748 --> 33:38.750
[laughter stops]

33:38.784 --> 33:41.087
Uh, how do you "win" a wedding?

33:41.120 --> 33:44.456
Well, by being the best,
of course.

33:44.490 --> 33:45.657
And then everybody goes,
"Wow, that was

33:45.691 --> 33:46.558
"the best wedding
I've ever been to!

33:46.592 --> 33:48.560
That was so much better
than Karen's."

33:48.594 --> 33:49.795
Who's Karen?

33:49.828 --> 33:51.830
[weak chuckle]
Never mind.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.499
[Molly]: All right, everyone!

33:53.532 --> 33:55.401
Are you ready for
your first partner class?

33:55.434 --> 33:56.635
Yeah.

33:56.668 --> 33:59.338
Yeah! Grooms!
Please, come, join us.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.075
Hi, Molly.

34:03.109 --> 34:04.143
Hi, Rennie.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.677
So this boot camp
thing's pretty cool.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.179
Should I, like, call you
"Sarge" or something?

34:07.213 --> 34:08.214
[laughs]

34:08.246 --> 34:11.083
No, "Molly" is fine.

34:11.117 --> 34:12.518
Why don't you guys
grab a spot?

34:15.121 --> 34:17.223
Good morning, recruits!

34:17.255 --> 34:19.225
Gentlemen, thank you
for being here.

34:19.257 --> 34:20.826
Now, I know most of you

34:20.859 --> 34:22.393
probably came here today

34:22.428 --> 34:24.862
because your future wives
asked you to be here,

34:24.896 --> 34:27.833
but these classes
where you work together

34:27.866 --> 34:30.402
are just as much for you
as they are for them.

34:30.436 --> 34:35.574
Today's exercises
are going to focus on...

34:35.607 --> 34:36.641
trust!

34:36.675 --> 34:41.880
One of the cornerstones
of any good relationship.

34:41.913 --> 34:45.583
And, to do that, we are going
to be doing some partner yoga.

34:45.617 --> 34:48.654
Now, don't worry if you've never
done any yoga before.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.422
We're going to start
very simple,

34:50.456 --> 34:52.358
and I just need a volunteer

34:52.391 --> 34:54.760
to help me demonstrate
the first pose.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.663
Nick can do it!

34:57.696 --> 34:59.431
Um, yeah, sure.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.600
-Okay. Sure.
-Yeah, great, Nick, come on up.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.669
Thank you.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.904
So, our first pose is going
to be "Back-to-Back Chair."

35:05.937 --> 35:08.640
So, we'll go
back to back...

35:08.674 --> 35:09.775
Uh-huh.
Okay.

35:09.808 --> 35:12.244
And then you're going to link
your arms behind you.

35:12.278 --> 35:13.279
All right.

35:13.312 --> 35:16.515
And then you'll slowly
walk your feet forward,

35:16.548 --> 35:18.384
until you're in
the sitting position.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.652
This requires trust.

35:20.686 --> 35:23.522
You need to both move
at the same speed.

35:23.555 --> 35:24.590
And...

35:24.623 --> 35:25.857
are you ready to go?

35:25.891 --> 35:26.925
Yeah, as ready
as I'm ever gonna be.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.160
Okay!

35:28.194 --> 35:29.495
Here we go. Okay.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.563
Are we going?

35:31.597 --> 35:32.931
We're going!

35:32.964 --> 35:34.466
There you go.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.435
And then, once you're down,

35:36.468 --> 35:40.406
hold it...
and breathe...

35:40.439 --> 35:41.740
And, when you're ready,

35:41.773 --> 35:44.510
you'll slowly walk your feet
back up

35:44.543 --> 35:46.478
into the standing position.
You ready to go?

35:46.512 --> 35:48.414
-I'm ready to go up!
-Okay. [laughing]

35:48.447 --> 35:50.282
And here we go!
Up, up, up!

35:50.316 --> 35:52.651
And there you go!

35:52.684 --> 35:54.753
Very nice, Nick!

35:54.786 --> 35:56.588
Okay!

35:56.622 --> 35:58.224
Now, everybody, grab a spot!

35:58.257 --> 36:00.726
Back-to-back,
link your arms...

36:00.759 --> 36:01.693
behind you.

36:03.229 --> 36:04.496
I'm the master of
this one, you know?

36:04.530 --> 36:05.464
-Yeah.
-I'm good.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.498
We better get this.

36:06.532 --> 36:09.435
[Nick]: You're whacking me
with your ponytail.

36:09.468 --> 36:10.402
-Whoa.
-Are you coming?

36:10.436 --> 36:11.870
No, no,
just a second,

36:11.903 --> 36:12.671
I think you're walking
way too fast!

36:12.704 --> 36:14.240
No, no-- Oh!

36:14.273 --> 36:15.507
Okay...

36:15.541 --> 36:17.276
That's all right.
It's all right.

36:17.309 --> 36:20.178
Not everyone gets it
on the first try.

36:21.647 --> 36:25.451
[♪♪♪]

36:35.661 --> 36:37.529
Hey, honey,

36:37.563 --> 36:38.697
Before we get out there.

36:38.730 --> 36:39.431
I just want to say

36:39.465 --> 36:40.766
you're not going
to embarrass me

36:40.799 --> 36:41.967
like you did
last week, right?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.835
I thought we agreed

36:43.869 --> 36:45.604
that our inability
to do a yoga pose

36:45.637 --> 36:46.938
was no a big deal.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.940
You're right.
I'm sorry.

36:48.974 --> 36:50.709
But maybe today
we could do better.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.578
Sure.

36:52.611 --> 36:55.481
Hey, everybody! Hello.

36:55.514 --> 36:56.815
[Molly]: All right!
Welcome back, grooms.

36:56.848 --> 36:58.850
Thank you for coming back.

36:58.884 --> 37:02.388
Uh, last week
was all about trust,

37:02.421 --> 37:04.390
and this week...

37:04.423 --> 37:06.692
we are working on

37:06.725 --> 37:08.260
sharing.

37:08.294 --> 37:09.628
Now, don't worry.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.563
What we're gonna do...

37:11.597 --> 37:12.864
is...

37:12.898 --> 37:14.966
everybody gets
one of these medicine balls.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.702
You're going to lift it
over your head,

37:16.735 --> 37:18.970
bring it down into a squat,

37:19.004 --> 37:21.907
and then you're going to pass it
to your partner,

37:21.940 --> 37:23.942
and then your partner will do
the same back to you.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.512
But, before you pass the ball,

37:26.545 --> 37:27.679
I want you to say,

37:27.713 --> 37:29.315
"I want to share..."

37:29.348 --> 37:31.783
and then share something.

37:31.817 --> 37:32.784
Um, quick question.

37:32.818 --> 37:35.521
What kinds of things
are we supposed to share?

37:35.554 --> 37:37.756
Anything. Could be big stuff,
could be little stuff,

37:37.789 --> 37:39.691
could be stuff you already
shared with your partner.

37:39.725 --> 37:40.659
Really doesn't matter.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.828
The important thing
is to get in the habit

37:42.861 --> 37:44.330
of sharing with your partner

37:44.363 --> 37:46.432
so that you can work together
as a team.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.033
All right? Okay!

37:48.066 --> 37:49.368
Here you go.

37:49.401 --> 37:52.704
Oh! I'm so sorry.
I have to take this.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.406
I'll be right back.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.907
Hello?

37:55.941 --> 37:58.544
Well, I guess it's
you and me again, huh?

37:58.577 --> 38:00.312
Okay, why don't you help
me get things set up?

38:00.346 --> 38:01.980
-Yeah, sure. Of course.
-Hi, Dad.

38:02.013 --> 38:03.949
Hey, did you get a look over
Nick's resume again?

38:03.982 --> 38:06.685
And do you think you can find
a place for him there?

38:06.718 --> 38:08.987
But you hired Karen's husband,

38:09.020 --> 38:11.657
and I know that he has
investment banking experience,

38:11.690 --> 38:13.725
but you could teach him.

38:13.759 --> 38:17.596
No, no, the photography thing's
just, like, a hobby.

38:17.629 --> 38:18.930
Dad, I understand,
but I'm pretty sure that...

38:18.964 --> 38:21.400
Okay, uh...

38:21.433 --> 38:23.935
I want to share

38:23.969 --> 38:25.704
that I was
born in Detroit

38:25.737 --> 38:27.373
but I moved here
when I was four,

38:27.406 --> 38:28.974
when my dad got a job
at Portland State.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.109
Okay... good one.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.345
Um...

38:33.379 --> 38:35.481
I want to share

38:35.514 --> 38:37.549
that, uh...

38:37.583 --> 38:39.451
I was born and raised here
and I love it.

38:39.485 --> 38:40.752
Even with
all the rain?

38:40.786 --> 38:43.555
Oh, I love the rain.
Yeah, it's cathartic.

38:43.589 --> 38:45.757
And it looks really
good in pictures, too, so.

38:45.791 --> 38:46.758
Why did you
become a photographer?

38:46.792 --> 38:48.360
Uh-uh-uh-uh...

38:48.394 --> 38:50.095
You didn't share.

38:50.128 --> 38:51.863
Oh, someone was
paying attention.

38:51.897 --> 38:53.499
Always paying
attention.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.734
All right. Uh,
I want to share

38:55.767 --> 38:57.636
that I want to know

38:57.669 --> 38:59.705
why you became
a photographer.

38:59.738 --> 39:00.672
Did you see that?
Did you see?

39:00.706 --> 39:02.441
I see what you did.

39:02.474 --> 39:04.610
Very slippery fish.

39:04.643 --> 39:05.811
Uh, okay...

39:05.844 --> 39:08.480
Fine. We'll do it
your way.

39:08.514 --> 39:11.082
I want to share...

39:11.116 --> 39:13.819
I got a camera for my birthday,
when I was a kid,

39:13.852 --> 39:17.088
and soon as I picked it up,
I just knew.

39:17.122 --> 39:18.790
It clicked.

39:18.824 --> 39:19.991
[giggles]

39:20.025 --> 39:21.560
I don't know, there's
just something

39:21.593 --> 39:23.395
about capturing a moment.

39:23.429 --> 39:25.497
And it's not just a photo,

39:25.531 --> 39:27.165
it's... [sighs]

39:27.198 --> 39:29.801
...it's like holding a memory
in your hand.

39:29.835 --> 39:30.702
That's nice.

39:30.736 --> 39:31.837
It's cheesy, right?
You think it's cheesy.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.071
No...

39:33.104 --> 39:34.440
it's nice.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.774
Okay, well, here,
your turn.

39:35.807 --> 39:37.142
Oh, okay, uh, what else?

39:37.175 --> 39:38.744
I want to hear the long story.

39:38.777 --> 39:39.711
Come on!

39:39.745 --> 39:40.812
No.

39:40.846 --> 39:41.813
It's just you, me,
and the ball!

39:41.847 --> 39:43.682
And my whole class.

39:43.715 --> 39:44.883
Forget those guys.
Just talk to me.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.818
Just tell me.

39:47.986 --> 39:50.021
[exhales deeply]

39:50.055 --> 39:53.892
I want to share
that I...

39:53.925 --> 39:56.962
almost got married.

39:56.995 --> 39:59.865
Like, walking-down-the-aisle-

39:59.898 --> 40:01.833
and-there's-no-groom-
at-the-end-of-it "almost".

40:01.867 --> 40:03.802
Yikes. What happened?

40:03.835 --> 40:06.204
Oh, I, uh...

40:06.237 --> 40:08.173
I wish I could say
there was one thing,

40:08.206 --> 40:11.710
like, he didn't like
the way I chewed, but...

40:12.911 --> 40:15.514
We just weren't ready.

40:15.547 --> 40:16.848
Okay, so, what'd you do?

40:16.882 --> 40:17.949
Well, I spent

40:17.983 --> 40:20.819
a lot of time trying
to figure out what went wrong,

40:20.852 --> 40:22.488
analyzing it

40:22.521 --> 40:24.623
from a very clinical
and rational point of view.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.792
Hmm. Well, that sounds
very healthy.

40:26.825 --> 40:29.160
Oh, I forgot to mention,
I was eating also--

40:29.194 --> 40:30.529
everything in sight...

40:30.562 --> 40:34.666
like, cookies and chips
and candy, and...

40:34.700 --> 40:35.967
just everything!

40:36.001 --> 40:37.469
If it didn't move,
I ate it.

40:37.503 --> 40:40.672
Okay, got it.
So, not exactly healthy.

40:40.706 --> 40:42.107
I, eventually,
I figured that out,

40:42.140 --> 40:44.209
and I started exercising,

40:44.242 --> 40:46.678
and, funnily enough,
I felt better.

40:46.712 --> 40:47.913
Imagine that.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.648
Well, that's, I mean,

40:49.681 --> 40:50.882
that's what brought me
to this point.

40:50.916 --> 40:52.217
Why I'm doing
what I'm doing.

40:52.250 --> 40:54.853
I want other people
to feel better,

40:54.886 --> 40:57.255
physically
and mentally.

40:57.288 --> 41:00.659
I want people to feel strong
when they get married.

41:05.531 --> 41:07.098
I'm very impressed by you,
Molly.

41:07.132 --> 41:08.967
Aw, no, come on.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.268
Okay, fine,
we'll do it your way.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.170
[laughing]

41:12.203 --> 41:13.939
I would like to share
the fact

41:13.972 --> 41:16.808
that I am very impressed
by you, Molly.

41:18.243 --> 41:19.611
Okay, thank you, Dad.
Love you. Bye.

41:20.779 --> 41:22.213
I'm so sorry
about that.

41:22.247 --> 41:24.616
Here.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.652
Okay. Um... so.

41:26.685 --> 41:29.521
I want to share,
let's see...

41:29.555 --> 41:31.757
how hot all this
is gonna make me look

41:31.790 --> 41:33.091
in my new wedding dress.

41:33.124 --> 41:35.260
If I ever find one.

41:35.293 --> 41:37.663
Yeah, yeah.
That's really good.

41:37.696 --> 41:38.764
That's good, right?
Okay, um...

41:38.797 --> 41:40.866
really good one.
Okay. Uh...

41:40.899 --> 41:43.835
I would like to share...

41:45.070 --> 41:47.505
[♪♪♪]

41:59.050 --> 42:01.887
I don't know.
They're all very nice, but...

42:01.920 --> 42:03.589
I understand.

42:03.622 --> 42:04.923
You want it
to be perfect.

42:04.956 --> 42:06.592
Yes! Thank you.

42:06.625 --> 42:08.960
I am so glad
that somebody gets it.

42:08.994 --> 42:09.861
Well, we have
new items coming in

42:09.895 --> 42:12.163
all the time,
so you can just check back.

42:12.197 --> 42:14.766
[♪♪♪]

42:16.267 --> 42:18.236
This is the dress!

42:18.269 --> 42:20.672
That is it!

42:20.706 --> 42:22.674
I'm sorry,
that dress is sold.

42:23.909 --> 42:25.176
It should be on
the Alterations rack.

42:25.210 --> 42:27.012
No, no, no, no.
There must be a mistake,

42:27.045 --> 42:29.280
because this
is my perfect dress.

42:29.314 --> 42:31.316
I don't know
what to tell you.

42:31.349 --> 42:32.951
Well, do you have
any others like it?

42:32.984 --> 42:34.720
Actually, no. These are
one-of-a-kind creations.

42:34.753 --> 42:36.121
Well, then you're gonna have
to tell whoever bought it

42:36.154 --> 42:37.856
that they can't have it
anymore.

42:37.889 --> 42:39.958
I'm sorry,
really.

42:39.991 --> 42:42.027
No. No, no, no, no.
Please.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.062
Please!

42:46.998 --> 42:48.767
[Molly]:
Nice haircut, Rennie.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.335
[Lisa]: So? What do you think,
sweetheart?

42:50.368 --> 42:52.938
[Rennie]: I like it!
It's got a good vibe.

42:52.971 --> 42:54.205
I know, me too!

42:54.239 --> 42:55.907
I mean, at first,
I wasn't sure,

42:55.941 --> 42:57.275
because I thought
it would be too formal,

42:57.308 --> 43:00.278
but then, when I started
picturing it with flowers

43:00.311 --> 43:01.847
and Hector
playing the bagpipes...

43:01.880 --> 43:02.914
What, bagpipes?

43:02.948 --> 43:04.182
Me in my dress
and you in the kilt.

43:04.215 --> 43:05.216
Kilt?

43:05.250 --> 43:07.018
I'm 1/16th Scottish.

43:07.052 --> 43:08.353
-Yeah, he is.
-1/16th Scottish.

43:08.386 --> 43:09.287
[Lisa]: Oh, my goodness.

43:09.320 --> 43:10.656
Wow!

43:10.689 --> 43:12.257
Okay, this, this is perfect.

43:12.290 --> 43:13.959
Baby, I'm gonna go
check out the kitchen.

43:13.992 --> 43:16.027
Okay.

43:16.061 --> 43:19.264
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

43:19.297 --> 43:21.132
[squeals]

43:21.166 --> 43:24.035
[chuckles] Oh.

43:24.069 --> 43:25.203
Wow.

43:26.371 --> 43:28.674
Hey. What's
going on with you?

43:28.707 --> 43:30.241
You seem a little judgey.

43:30.275 --> 43:31.309
Okay, look.

43:31.342 --> 43:32.878
Bagpipes?
Come on! Really?

43:32.911 --> 43:34.713
Molly!
This is my wedding!

43:34.746 --> 43:37.048
And I will have it
the way I want it,

43:37.082 --> 43:39.685
and I want bagpipes,
lots of 'em!

43:39.718 --> 43:43.188
Like, a parade of bagpipes!

43:43.221 --> 43:44.690
Do you think
they actually do that?

43:44.723 --> 43:47.225
[laughing]
Okay. All right.

43:48.727 --> 43:50.195
[Nick]: Jenna, honey,
it's just a dress.

43:50.228 --> 43:51.797
It's my dress!

43:51.830 --> 43:53.164
You know, I think you're making
a bigger deal of this

43:53.198 --> 43:54.199
than it needs to be.

43:54.232 --> 43:56.301
I don't think
that you understand!

43:56.334 --> 43:58.904
Well, you're right,
I don't understand.

43:58.937 --> 44:01.272
So, why don't you help me?

44:01.306 --> 44:03.041
Hey, you remember
that exercise?

44:03.074 --> 44:04.776
"I want to share..."

44:04.810 --> 44:07.713
I want to share...

44:07.746 --> 44:10.081
This is a really big deal!

44:10.115 --> 44:11.950
[sighing heavily]

44:11.983 --> 44:14.419
I want to share that you need
to calm down a little bit,

44:14.452 --> 44:15.954
there are other dresses
out there.

44:15.987 --> 44:17.388
Not as good as this dress.

44:17.422 --> 44:19.424
And I know,
I know,

44:19.457 --> 44:21.292
you're thinking,
"she's a total Bridezilla."

44:21.326 --> 44:22.794
Well, you came running
out of a store crying,

44:22.828 --> 44:23.962
'cause you couldn't get
the dress you want.

44:23.995 --> 44:25.797
Well, what would
you call that?

44:25.831 --> 44:27.465
So because I want
my wedding to be flawless,

44:27.498 --> 44:29.801
suddenly,
I'm the bad guy?

44:29.835 --> 44:31.136
You keep saying that.

44:31.169 --> 44:32.037
Saying what?

44:32.070 --> 44:33.371
"My" wedding.

44:33.404 --> 44:35.306
But it's not,
it's our wedding, right?

44:35.340 --> 44:37.776
Yeah, of course.
That's what I meant.

44:37.809 --> 44:38.944
"Our wedding."

44:42.013 --> 44:44.349
[♪♪♪]

44:50.355 --> 44:52.824
[♪♪♪]

44:53.959 --> 44:55.193
He's really good.

44:55.226 --> 44:56.327
I know!

44:56.361 --> 44:58.163
And it only cost me
a membership!

44:58.196 --> 45:00.098
He's gonna shoot
your boot camp, too.

45:00.131 --> 45:02.801
New pictures
for the wall.

45:02.834 --> 45:04.402
Uh, so you're cool
to open tomorrow?

45:04.435 --> 45:05.336
I've got that
fitness conference

45:05.370 --> 45:06.738
in the morning.

45:06.772 --> 45:08.039
Yes, of course.
Have fun.

45:08.073 --> 45:09.207
Great. Thanks.
Uh, hey.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.209
Can you give that
tablet back to Nick?

45:11.242 --> 45:12.477
Why can't you do it?

45:12.510 --> 45:14.412
Because I'm not gonna
be here, remember?

45:14.445 --> 45:15.513
From ten seconds ago?

45:15.546 --> 45:17.082
Right.

45:17.115 --> 45:18.483
Take a look at some of
the other pictures he took.

45:18.516 --> 45:20.852
They're amazing.

45:20.886 --> 45:22.353
I'll be in
around 4:00!

45:22.387 --> 45:24.890
Okay.

45:27.392 --> 45:29.795

45:38.336 --> 45:40.238
[door bell jingles]

45:40.271 --> 45:41.406
Hi.

45:41.439 --> 45:42.373
We're about to close.

45:42.407 --> 45:44.876
Could I just look at a dress
really quick?

45:44.910 --> 45:46.477
Please?

45:46.511 --> 45:48.146
Sure. I'll be with you
in a minute.

45:48.179 --> 45:50.248
Thank you.

45:51.416 --> 45:53.451

45:59.524 --> 46:01.526
[heavy sigh]

46:05.030 --> 46:07.132
[♪♪♪]

46:16.975 --> 46:19.878
That... is a beautiful dress.

46:19.911 --> 46:21.179
I know.

46:21.212 --> 46:23.014
I wish it was mine.

46:23.048 --> 46:24.215
Why can't it be?

46:24.249 --> 46:26.251
Well, because it's...

46:28.086 --> 46:30.121
Really?

46:31.957 --> 46:33.124
Well, hello there!

46:33.158 --> 46:34.592
Oh!

46:34.625 --> 46:36.427
Uh, hi!

46:36.461 --> 46:37.929
Hi!

46:37.963 --> 46:40.365
Um, Daniel called me
and he told me that, uh,

46:40.398 --> 46:41.599
he gave my tablet to you?

46:41.632 --> 46:45.603
Uh, well, I was gonna give it
to you tomorrow, but, uh...

46:45.636 --> 46:47.973
Here.

46:48.006 --> 46:49.040
Thank you so much.

46:49.074 --> 46:50.208
I'm showing
Brendan and Elizabeth

46:50.241 --> 46:51.242
their wedding photos--

46:51.276 --> 46:52.577
-Nice!
-...First thing tomorrow.

46:52.610 --> 46:54.145
-Nice, nice. Great.
-Yeah.

46:54.179 --> 46:55.246
Uh, how'd you know
where I live?

46:55.280 --> 46:56.848
Well, I followed you.

46:56.882 --> 46:57.815
[both laughing]

46:57.849 --> 46:59.851
No, I'm kidding.
Daniel gave me your address.

46:59.885 --> 47:01.352
Hope that's okay.

47:01.386 --> 47:02.854
I promise I won't tell Lefty
where you're at.

47:02.888 --> 47:04.555
[Russian accent]:
Oh, I appreciate that.

47:04.589 --> 47:06.191
No, it's totally fine.

47:06.224 --> 47:08.059
Okay. Well, thank you.

47:08.093 --> 47:09.560
Um, guess I'll see you
at the gym.

47:10.996 --> 47:13.064
I really like your pictures.

47:14.199 --> 47:16.267
Sorry, what?

47:16.301 --> 47:17.335
Uh, your pictures.

47:17.368 --> 47:19.304
We were looking
at the gym photos,

47:19.337 --> 47:21.039
and then I-I wanted to see
more of your work.

47:21.072 --> 47:22.373
I hope you don't mind.

47:22.407 --> 47:24.375
No! No, no, no.
I don't mind at all.

47:24.409 --> 47:26.077
So you liked
them, huh?

47:26.111 --> 47:27.412
Tell me more!

47:27.445 --> 47:29.981
[laughs]
I love them, actually.

47:30.015 --> 47:33.018
I really like the one
of the tree in the rain.

47:33.051 --> 47:35.286
Well, I get what you mean--
cathartic.

47:35.320 --> 47:37.088
Well, thank you. Yeah.

47:37.122 --> 47:38.556
That-- That one's actually
one of my faves.

47:38.589 --> 47:40.025
You're
an incredible photographer.

47:40.058 --> 47:41.026
Ahh!

47:41.059 --> 47:43.494
No, really, why don't
you do more of those?

47:43.528 --> 47:45.396
Well, I would like to,
but, unfortunately,

47:45.430 --> 47:47.665
the bank won't accept
my incredible photography skills

47:47.698 --> 47:49.167
as payment
on my mortgage.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.401
Very short-sighted
of them.

47:50.435 --> 47:52.370
I keep telling them that!

47:52.403 --> 47:53.538
If it means anything,

47:53.571 --> 47:55.506
I would accept
one of those as payment,

47:55.540 --> 47:58.609
so if you ever want
a cardio kick-boxing class...

47:58.643 --> 48:00.045
Well, thank you,
that does mean a lot to me.

48:00.078 --> 48:01.446
I'll pass on the kick-boxing
for now.

48:01.479 --> 48:02.447
-Really?
-Yeah.

48:02.480 --> 48:05.316
Anyway, um... thank you.

48:07.352 --> 48:09.254
Actually, you know what?
Since--

48:09.287 --> 48:12.157
Since I got you here,
can I ask you a question?

48:12.190 --> 48:13.591
Yeah.

48:13.624 --> 48:15.660
Just kinda
a hypothetical.

48:15.693 --> 48:19.030
If you had known,
when your wedding didn't...

48:19.064 --> 48:20.631
Yep?

48:20.665 --> 48:22.700
Um, would you have...

48:22.733 --> 48:24.002
called it off,

48:24.035 --> 48:25.103
or would you
have tried to fix it?

48:25.136 --> 48:26.471
Oh.

48:26.504 --> 48:28.406
Uh... [chuckles]

48:28.439 --> 48:30.608
Well, uh...

48:33.144 --> 48:34.712
I think
I would've tried to fix it.

48:34.745 --> 48:38.149
That's the whole point
of the boot camps, right?

48:38.183 --> 48:41.452
I want people to feel strong
when they get married.

48:41.486 --> 48:44.055
I don't want another bride

48:44.089 --> 48:46.291
standing there,
feeling the way I did...

48:46.324 --> 48:48.359
in that dress.

48:52.197 --> 48:53.231
Okay.

48:54.432 --> 48:55.500
Thank you.

49:00.105 --> 49:02.007
See you
at the gym.

49:03.208 --> 49:06.511
[♪♪♪]

49:08.013 --> 49:11.016
Ooh! Nick!
They're beautiful.

49:11.049 --> 49:13.618
Oh, I love it,
I love this one.

49:13.651 --> 49:15.653
Oh, yeah,
that is a good one.

49:16.754 --> 49:17.722
That's a good one.

49:17.755 --> 49:19.057
I don't look
squinty in that one.

49:19.090 --> 49:21.059
You don't look squinty
in any of them.

49:21.092 --> 49:23.394
Oh! You can fix
the squinty, right?

49:23.428 --> 49:26.331
Yeah, of course!
Stop squinting.

49:26.364 --> 49:28.733
So, guys, how's married life
going, anyway?

49:28.766 --> 49:30.168
-It's great!
-Yeah?

49:30.201 --> 49:31.336
Yeah. Best
decision I ever made.

49:31.369 --> 49:34.005
Of course he has to say that,
'cause I'm in the room.

49:34.039 --> 49:35.673
I would say that

49:35.706 --> 49:37.542
regardless of where you were,
and you know that.

49:37.575 --> 49:39.144
Aww.

49:39.177 --> 49:40.278
Yeah.

49:40.311 --> 49:41.446
We did good.

49:41.479 --> 49:43.214
What about you?
You guys set a date?

49:43.248 --> 49:45.550
Um... a date?

49:45.583 --> 49:47.318
Well, no, not-- I mean,

49:47.352 --> 49:50.421
we've only been engaged
for a few weeks, so...

49:51.822 --> 49:54.359
Is everything okay?

49:56.127 --> 49:59.230
I don't know.
Uh... [sighing]

50:01.566 --> 50:03.468
When you were engaged,

50:03.501 --> 50:05.803
did you guys
ever have any, um...

50:05.836 --> 50:07.338
like, doubts?

50:07.372 --> 50:08.606
-Absolutely.
-Every day.

50:08.639 --> 50:09.774
Really?

50:09.807 --> 50:11.076
[laughing] Yes!

50:11.109 --> 50:12.510
It's totally
normal, Nick.

50:12.543 --> 50:14.512
Okay, well,
how did you get over it?

50:14.545 --> 50:16.114
Well, Molly's boot camp
really helped.

50:16.147 --> 50:17.115
Yeah.

50:17.148 --> 50:17.915
Mm.

50:17.948 --> 50:19.217
We learned what
was really important

50:19.250 --> 50:20.585
and what was just silly stuff

50:20.618 --> 50:21.819
that we were
letting distract us.

50:21.852 --> 50:23.688
But, also, I think,

50:23.721 --> 50:27.725
you just kind of know
in your heart that it's right.

50:27.758 --> 50:29.394
You know, even with
all the silliness

50:29.427 --> 50:31.596
in the kitchen
before the wedding,

50:31.629 --> 50:33.631
it was okay,

50:33.664 --> 50:38.136
because, in the end, I couldn't
picture it any other way,

50:38.169 --> 50:39.337
than, well...

50:40.438 --> 50:42.340
that.

50:47.878 --> 50:51.149
[chatter, indistinct]

50:51.182 --> 50:53.251
Thanks for coming out
with us, coach.

50:53.284 --> 50:54.419
I'm surprised
you don't have us

50:54.452 --> 50:56.087
running laps
to burn off the calories.

50:56.121 --> 50:58.756
I don't work all the time.

50:58.789 --> 51:00.358
Right. She's gonna
make us pay for this

51:00.391 --> 51:03.128
tomorrow in class.

51:03.161 --> 51:04.829
Hey, why didn't Jenna come?

51:04.862 --> 51:06.631
Oh, she's looking at
flowers for her wedding.

51:06.664 --> 51:09.200
Hey, what do you guys
think about her and Nick?

51:09.234 --> 51:10.101
You noticed it, too, huh?

51:10.135 --> 51:11.802
They just didn't seem
like they were...

51:11.836 --> 51:13.304
-Connected!
-[overlapping]: Yes!

51:13.338 --> 51:14.205
Exactly!

51:14.239 --> 51:16.207
Guys, let's talk about
something else.

51:16.241 --> 51:18.143
I mean, Nick did the partner
yoga thing better with Molly

51:18.176 --> 51:19.310
than he did
with Jenna.

51:19.344 --> 51:20.345
No, he didn't.

51:20.378 --> 51:21.712
Yeah! He did.

51:21.746 --> 51:22.647
You know, I think
we should order.

51:22.680 --> 51:23.814
Where's that waiter?

51:23.848 --> 51:25.450
Well, she did
say it herself.

51:25.483 --> 51:27.084
She wants to win, and I don't
think it matters with who.

51:30.688 --> 51:33.391
Good. Great technique, man.
Remember to breathe.

51:34.425 --> 51:35.393
Breathe, Colleen.

51:35.426 --> 51:36.561
Hey, Nick.

51:36.594 --> 51:37.695
Hey, Daniel.

51:37.728 --> 51:39.364
Did you get the tablet
back from Molly?

51:39.397 --> 51:40.398
Yeah, I did. Thank you.

51:40.431 --> 51:41.466
No, thank you.

51:41.499 --> 51:42.900
The pictures
of the gym are great.

51:42.933 --> 51:44.169
Oh, good.

51:44.202 --> 51:45.570
No, seriously,
I can't believe

51:45.603 --> 51:47.405
you're thinking
of giving this up.

51:47.438 --> 51:48.606
You're way
too good, man.

51:48.639 --> 51:50.841
Sorry.
Why would I give it up?

51:51.942 --> 51:54.279
I overheard Jenna
on the phone last week.

51:54.312 --> 51:56.581
She said something about a gig
with her dad's company?

51:56.614 --> 51:57.515
Sorry, what?

51:58.883 --> 52:00.185
Maybe I heard wrong.

52:00.218 --> 52:02.320
Yeah.

52:03.754 --> 52:05.823
Yeah, maybe you heard wrong.

52:07.725 --> 52:09.827
[♪♪♪]

52:11.796 --> 52:14.365
[doorbell rings]

52:26.344 --> 52:27.312
Hi.

52:27.345 --> 52:28.879
Hi.

52:28.913 --> 52:30.381
So, when were you
going to tell me?

52:30.415 --> 52:31.516
Tell you what?

52:31.549 --> 52:33.484
About the interview you set up
at your dad's company.

52:33.518 --> 52:35.820
Are you trying to get me
a job there again?

52:35.853 --> 52:37.222
Well, yes, but...

52:37.255 --> 52:38.356
Oh, come on!

52:38.389 --> 52:40.958
I didn't set up
any sort of interview.

52:40.991 --> 52:43.328
I wouldn't do that
without talking to you first.

52:43.361 --> 52:44.829
Who told you
about that, anyway?

52:44.862 --> 52:46.731
Does it matter?

52:46.764 --> 52:49.434
Nick, relax. It was
a hypothetical conversation.

52:49.467 --> 52:51.669
That way, if you ever
wanted to do anything else...

52:51.702 --> 52:52.603
I don't want
to do something else.

52:52.637 --> 52:53.671
I love what I do!

52:53.704 --> 52:54.839
Of course you do,
and it's fine.

52:54.872 --> 52:55.973
"Fine"?

52:56.006 --> 52:57.375
Really? It's fine?

52:57.408 --> 52:59.577
You know,
I'll have you know

52:59.610 --> 53:00.911
that some people think
that my photography

53:00.945 --> 53:02.247
is better than "fine".

53:02.280 --> 53:03.681
Okay, you know what I meant.

53:03.714 --> 53:05.416
It's good to have
another option, just in case.

53:05.450 --> 53:06.584
In case what?

53:06.617 --> 53:08.519
Nick, we're getting married.

53:08.553 --> 53:09.420
We're gonna
start a family.

53:09.454 --> 53:10.988
We need to be thinking
about the future.

53:11.021 --> 53:12.990
Yeah, I am,
I am thinking about the future.

53:13.023 --> 53:14.959
Well, what does that mean?

53:14.992 --> 53:16.861
That means that you seem
to have some kind of vision

53:16.894 --> 53:18.429
about how everything
is supposed to be.

53:18.463 --> 53:19.797
How the wedding is supposed be,

53:19.830 --> 53:20.998
how the marriage
is supposed to be,

53:21.031 --> 53:22.166
what I'm supposed to be like.

53:22.199 --> 53:25.270
It just doesn't seem like
I have any say in any of that.

53:25.303 --> 53:26.671
Nick, if you don't
want the job with my dad--

53:26.704 --> 53:28.439
I don't want
the job with your dad!

53:28.473 --> 53:29.707
That's not what
I'm talking about!

53:29.740 --> 53:30.908
Well, what are you
talking about?

53:30.941 --> 53:32.877
I'm talking about us, Jenna.

53:32.910 --> 53:34.545
I'm talking

53:34.579 --> 53:36.847
about us.

53:42.653 --> 53:44.755
Into every marriage
a little rain must fall, ladies.

53:44.789 --> 53:47.458
It's not all going to be
sunshine and flowers.

53:47.492 --> 53:49.260
Work through it!

53:49.294 --> 53:50.495
You don't have to love it,

53:50.528 --> 53:52.863
but you can't give up
because of it.

53:52.897 --> 53:54.031
And be honest!

53:54.064 --> 53:59.937
Honesty is the cornerstone
of every good relationship.

53:59.970 --> 54:00.938
You want to say something,

54:00.971 --> 54:03.508
but you might be afraid
to say it out loud.

54:03.541 --> 54:05.042
That's okay!
Do you feel that?

54:05.075 --> 54:07.612
Do you feel the burn
of wanting to be honest?

54:07.645 --> 54:09.914
Abby? What do you
want to say to me?

54:09.947 --> 54:11.482
I hate
stomach crunches!

54:11.516 --> 54:12.483
[Molly laughs]

54:12.517 --> 54:14.385
Yes! Everyone hates
doing stomach crunches.

54:14.419 --> 54:16.621
Lisa? What do you
want to say?

54:16.654 --> 54:18.656
[groaning]:
Oh! My sister's a sadist!

54:18.689 --> 54:20.391
All right.
I will take that.

54:20.425 --> 54:22.026
I'm sure you're not the only one
who thinks that. Claire!

54:22.059 --> 54:24.329
Can't talk.
Too much pain.

54:24.362 --> 54:25.996
Very good!
That's honest.

54:26.030 --> 54:27.865
What about
you, Quinn?

54:27.898 --> 54:29.400
I like stomach crunches!

54:29.434 --> 54:30.901
[everyone groaning]

54:30.935 --> 54:32.069
[Molly]: No, no, no!

54:32.102 --> 54:35.673
Open and honest communication,
even if it's unpopular.

54:35.706 --> 54:37.308
Jenna, what about you?

54:37.342 --> 54:39.710
Ugh! Sometimes we say a lot,

54:39.744 --> 54:42.580
even when
we don't say anything.

54:42.613 --> 54:43.614
Yes, absolutely.

54:43.648 --> 54:46.317
Sometimes, we say a lot
with no words at all.

54:46.351 --> 54:47.785
For instance...

54:47.818 --> 54:50.488
look what happens when I say
to all of you right now

54:50.521 --> 54:51.956
you are done
with your stomach crunches.

54:51.989 --> 54:52.957
[recruits]: Yeah!

54:52.990 --> 54:54.359
[all groaning]

54:54.392 --> 54:55.460
All right,
great work, everyone.

54:55.493 --> 54:56.527
I'll see you next week.

54:56.561 --> 54:57.895
Grab a towel
on your way out.

54:57.928 --> 54:58.996
[Quinn]: Feels good, right?

54:59.029 --> 55:00.965
[Molly chuckles]

55:02.533 --> 55:04.769
My abdominal muscles
hate you right now.

55:04.802 --> 55:06.671
Can I have my phone?

55:06.704 --> 55:07.638
[panting]

55:07.672 --> 55:08.573
Here.

55:08.606 --> 55:10.040
Thanks.

55:10.074 --> 55:12.610
Ooh!
The bridal boutique called.

55:12.643 --> 55:13.911
Maybe my dress is ready.

55:13.944 --> 55:16.013
[chuckling]

55:18.148 --> 55:19.784
Thanks.

55:26.090 --> 55:27.024
No!

55:27.057 --> 55:27.992
Lisa, what is it?

55:28.025 --> 55:29.827
My dress is gone.

55:29.860 --> 55:30.928
What happened?

55:30.961 --> 55:32.563
The bridal boutique
was holding it for alterations

55:32.597 --> 55:34.432
and they accidentally
sold it to someone!

55:34.465 --> 55:36.133
That's crazy.

55:36.166 --> 55:37.167
Do they have another one?

55:37.201 --> 55:39.437
No! It was one of a kind!
There is no other one.

55:39.470 --> 55:41.372
Lisa, it's okay.

55:41.406 --> 55:43.441
We'll sort this out.

55:43.474 --> 55:44.942
Okay. Okay.

55:48.145 --> 55:49.079
My dress!

55:50.548 --> 55:51.916
It's a sign.

55:51.949 --> 55:52.950
It's not a sign.

55:52.983 --> 55:54.051
It's a sign!

55:54.084 --> 55:55.820
It was going too well.

55:55.853 --> 55:57.822
The dress, the church,
the bagpipes...

55:57.855 --> 55:59.524
Maybe the bagpipes
were a sign.

55:59.557 --> 56:01.426
This is not funny!

56:01.459 --> 56:02.427
Okay.

56:02.460 --> 56:03.594
Okay, sorry.

56:03.628 --> 56:05.796
Look, everything
is going to be fine.

56:05.830 --> 56:07.164
No, it won't.

56:07.197 --> 56:08.433
I think we rushed into this.

56:08.466 --> 56:09.467
Where'd you get that idea?

56:09.500 --> 56:10.167
You!

56:10.200 --> 56:11.469
You said it.

56:11.502 --> 56:12.470
When did you start
listening to me?

56:12.503 --> 56:13.871
Molly!

56:13.904 --> 56:16.173
Okay, look.
This isn't about me.

56:16.206 --> 56:17.408
This is about you.

56:17.442 --> 56:18.443
You love Rennie,

56:18.476 --> 56:19.910
and the bridal shop
losing your wedding dress

56:19.944 --> 56:21.579
has nothing
to do with that.

56:21.612 --> 56:23.080
Right?

56:23.113 --> 56:24.682
-Right.
-Yeah!

56:24.715 --> 56:26.751
You're right. I...

56:26.784 --> 56:27.952
[exhales]

56:27.985 --> 56:30.588
Just the wedding
is in two weeks.

56:30.621 --> 56:32.490
I'm never gonna find
another dress that soon.

56:32.523 --> 56:33.624
The boutique said

56:33.658 --> 56:35.626
that they would give you
any other dress that you want.

56:35.660 --> 56:36.827
I'm sure there's
something else there

56:36.861 --> 56:37.962
that you will love.

56:37.995 --> 56:39.997
I'm not gonna find one
as much as I loved that dress.

56:40.030 --> 56:41.666
You don't know that.
Why don't we go

56:41.699 --> 56:43.100
after my last class?
Quinn and Abby said

56:43.133 --> 56:44.602
that they would go
for moral support.

56:47.071 --> 56:48.138
Huh?

56:48.172 --> 56:49.940
Okay.

56:51.676 --> 56:53.744
I hope whoever
gets that dress

56:53.778 --> 56:54.812
trips on it

56:54.845 --> 56:55.980
when she walks
down the aisle.

56:56.013 --> 56:58.549
That's the spirit!
[chuckling]

57:00.718 --> 57:03.521
[♪♪♪]

57:06.791 --> 57:09.460
Stop trying to make me
feel guilty.

57:09.494 --> 57:11.195
[doorbell rings]

57:12.597 --> 57:13.564
[sighs]

57:18.969 --> 57:20.204
Can I come in?

57:20.237 --> 57:22.940
Of course.

57:22.973 --> 57:25.075
Listen,
about last night--

57:25.109 --> 57:26.110
Nick.

57:26.143 --> 57:27.211
No, no, no.

57:27.244 --> 57:28.779
Let me just get out
what I need to say.

57:28.813 --> 57:30.915
It's just that
I think that we need to...

57:32.683 --> 57:34.819
Did you buy
a wedding dress?

57:34.852 --> 57:36.487
I did.

57:36.521 --> 57:37.955
But I thought that

57:37.988 --> 57:39.724
the one you already
found was perfect.

57:39.757 --> 57:40.825
It was.

57:40.858 --> 57:42.660
So you found
another perfect one?

57:42.693 --> 57:45.896
Not exactly.

57:45.930 --> 57:48.633
So, what?
You steal the first one?

57:50.000 --> 57:52.069
Jenna?
What's going on?

57:53.303 --> 57:54.805
Do you remember
that whole Bridezilla thing

57:54.839 --> 57:56.106
that I was talking about?

57:57.274 --> 57:58.275
What'd you do?

57:58.308 --> 57:59.577
I stole the dress.

57:59.610 --> 58:00.745
You what?

58:00.778 --> 58:01.979
You stole the dress!

58:02.012 --> 58:03.581
Okay, well, I didn't
steal the dress,

58:03.614 --> 58:04.448
I paid for it,

58:04.481 --> 58:06.817
but I kind of stole it
from someone.

58:06.851 --> 58:08.686
-From who?
-Molly's sister.

58:08.719 --> 58:10.555
You stole Lisa's dress?

58:10.588 --> 58:12.156
But I didn't know
that it was Lisa's dress,

58:12.189 --> 58:13.991
I thought it belonged to
some bride that I didn't know.

58:14.024 --> 58:15.092
And that makes it any better?

58:15.125 --> 58:16.894
No, not really,
especially now

58:16.927 --> 58:18.295
that's it's just sitting there,
judging me!

58:18.328 --> 58:19.496
Jenna.

58:21.732 --> 58:24.935
But what's done is done,

58:24.969 --> 58:27.171
and there's really nothing
that I can do about it anymore.

58:27.204 --> 58:29.574
Yes! There is!
You can take it back.

58:29.607 --> 58:30.975
-I can't do that.
-Why?

58:31.008 --> 58:34.545
It's my dress!
It's my perfect dress!

58:34.579 --> 58:35.580
You keep saying that.

58:35.613 --> 58:37.147
You keep saying you want
everything to be perfect,

58:37.181 --> 58:38.549
and that scares me.

58:38.583 --> 58:42.019
Because I'm not.
I'm not perfect.

58:42.052 --> 58:43.721
Neither are you.

58:43.754 --> 58:45.022
But if you expect me to be,

58:45.055 --> 58:46.090
it's better
that I know that now,

58:46.123 --> 58:48.693
instead of disappointing you
later down the road.

58:53.598 --> 58:55.566
We don't take returns.

58:55.600 --> 58:57.635
No, but you have to.

58:57.668 --> 58:59.570
I can't!

59:00.705 --> 59:02.039
[Lisa]: Hi. Okay.

59:02.072 --> 59:03.107
I'm sorry.

59:03.140 --> 59:06.210
You have ladies have got
a lot of explaining to do.

59:06.243 --> 59:09.179
Oh! That's...
That's my dress.

59:09.213 --> 59:11.649
How did you
get my dress?

59:11.682 --> 59:13.183
This woman here

59:13.217 --> 59:15.986
has very kindly agreed
to bring the dress back,

59:16.020 --> 59:17.922
so that
you could have it

59:17.955 --> 59:19.023
if you still want it.

59:19.056 --> 59:20.625
Jenna? Why did you
have my dress?

59:21.859 --> 59:23.894
Well... I bought it.

59:23.928 --> 59:25.329
How? It was already sold.

59:25.362 --> 59:26.864
Right, and that's
a funny story...

59:26.897 --> 59:27.832
Wait, wait, wait.

59:27.865 --> 59:30.034
Jenna, did you have
the dress the entire time?

59:30.067 --> 59:32.803
But-- But you were
with Lisa this morning

59:32.837 --> 59:34.104
when she found out
it was missing.

59:34.138 --> 59:36.741
I was, and that's
a really funny story, too.

59:36.774 --> 59:37.708
Jenna, did you know

59:37.742 --> 59:39.276
the dress was already
sold when you bought it?

59:42.947 --> 59:44.815
Okay, yeah, I knew,

59:44.849 --> 59:46.751
but I didn't know
that it was sold to you.

59:48.085 --> 59:50.621
All's well that ends well,
right?

59:51.756 --> 59:52.923
That's it?

59:54.058 --> 59:55.626
Do you
have any idea

59:55.660 --> 59:56.360
what you
put me through?

59:56.393 --> 59:57.461
Lisa.

59:57.494 --> 59:59.096
I can't believe you're not
even gonna say you're sorry.

59:59.129 --> 01:00:01.666
I almost canceled
my wedding because of this!

01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:04.735
But I guess that's how

01:00:04.769 --> 01:00:07.204
that's how you make sure
your wedding "wins," right?

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.154
Molly.

01:00:24.188 --> 01:00:26.691
Lisa, I have to.

01:00:29.426 --> 01:00:31.395
[scoffs]

01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:34.364
Jenna!

01:00:34.398 --> 01:00:36.934
Jenna! Wait!

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.403
No. Tell your sister
I really am sorry.

01:00:39.436 --> 01:00:41.038
I think you should
tell her that.

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.740
No, I can't
face her.

01:00:42.773 --> 01:00:45.042
I can't face
any of them right now.

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:46.343
What is
going on, Jenna?

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:48.412
Is this about
your sister?

01:00:48.445 --> 01:00:51.048
It was, but...

01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:52.783
[sighs] I'm
starting to think

01:00:52.817 --> 01:00:55.152
that it's about
more than that.

01:01:00.457 --> 01:01:04.361
What if I'm trying to make
my wedding perfect...

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:07.131
because I know that
my relationship with Nick isn't?

01:01:08.465 --> 01:01:10.400
[♪♪♪]

01:01:15.472 --> 01:01:18.075
What do you
think about us?

01:01:18.108 --> 01:01:20.144
As a couple?

01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:27.051
I, uh...

01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:31.221
I think
that you love him

01:01:31.255 --> 01:01:32.356
and that he loves you.

01:01:34.859 --> 01:01:36.460
But is that enough?

01:01:36.493 --> 01:01:38.328
It's enough
that you can't just walk away.

01:01:39.997 --> 01:01:41.398
Look, Jenna.

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:43.768
I think you and Nick
need to stop

01:01:43.801 --> 01:01:45.369
and really think about
what you want.

01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:46.904
For the wedding?

01:01:46.937 --> 01:01:48.272
No. No, Jenna.

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:49.940
Not for the wedding.

01:01:49.974 --> 01:01:51.308
For yourselves.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:53.477
For your life,
for your future.

01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:57.347
Is this really where
you thought you'd end up?

01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:58.883
Sitting outside
of a bridal store

01:01:58.916 --> 01:01:59.984
where you hijacked a dress?

01:02:00.017 --> 01:02:01.151
[laughs]

01:02:01.185 --> 01:02:04.054
This is not
my finest moment.

01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:08.325
So what do you need to do
to turn it into one?

01:02:08.358 --> 01:02:10.995
Mm.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.299
Thank you.

01:02:15.332 --> 01:02:17.401
Just doing my job.

01:02:21.538 --> 01:02:22.973
[sighing]

01:02:27.812 --> 01:02:30.247
[printer chugging rhythmically]

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.416
[♪♪♪]

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.186
[Molly, calling out]: Lisa?

01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:11.088
I'm not leaving
until you open the door.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:12.857
Partly because

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:15.592
you have locked yourself
in my bedroom,

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:19.830
but also because
I need to talk to you.

01:03:19.864 --> 01:03:21.298
Okay, well,
until you open the door,

01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:23.233
I'm just gonna...

01:03:29.974 --> 01:03:31.208
You're mad at me.

01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:32.276
Yes.

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:33.377
Because I went
after Jenna?

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:34.311
Yes!

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:35.512
Mm, 'cause you felt

01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:36.847
like I was choosing
her over you?

01:03:36.881 --> 01:03:37.882
Don't marriage
counselor me.

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:39.917
I'm sorry.

01:03:41.285 --> 01:03:44.021
And I'm not making excuses
for her,

01:03:44.054 --> 01:03:45.155
but Jenna is my client.

01:03:45.189 --> 01:03:47.024
I'm your client, too!

01:03:47.057 --> 01:03:49.126
And I'm
your sister!

01:03:52.629 --> 01:03:55.599
That's like...
three to one.

01:03:55.632 --> 01:03:56.867
Mm?

01:03:56.901 --> 01:03:58.635
Sister
counts for two.

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:00.270
Oh. Okay.

01:04:00.304 --> 01:04:01.305
Well, there were
three of you.

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:02.472
Thank you.

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:04.108
But only one of you
needed my help.

01:04:05.509 --> 01:04:06.510
Really?

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:08.345
Mm-hmm. Really.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.883
That means
I'm, like... Super-Bride.

01:04:12.917 --> 01:04:13.918
Well!
I don't know--

01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:15.219
-...That I'd go--
-I'm Super-Bride!

01:04:15.252 --> 01:04:17.487
Okay. You are
Super-Bride. [laughs]

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:19.456
But even Super-Bride
has to forgive

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:22.092
the people who try
to steal her cape.

01:04:22.126 --> 01:04:23.593
Ugh...

01:04:23.627 --> 01:04:24.661
Fine.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:25.896
Mm-hmm.

01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:26.964
That doesn't mean

01:04:26.997 --> 01:04:28.132
I have to be nice
to her, do I?

01:04:28.165 --> 01:04:29.166
-No!
-Good!

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.135
She ruined my dress!

01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:33.003
Did she?
Did she rip it?

01:04:33.037 --> 01:04:35.305
No, it's just got
a bad energy now.

01:04:35.339 --> 01:04:36.974
[laughing]

01:04:37.007 --> 01:04:39.476
Well, then, put it
in the closet next to mine.

01:04:39.509 --> 01:04:41.278
They can keep
each other company.

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:42.646
[both laughing]

01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:51.021
[knocking]

01:04:51.055 --> 01:04:52.322
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:04:52.356 --> 01:04:54.024
Do you have a minute?

01:04:54.058 --> 01:04:55.659
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:59.129
Uh, well, I just wanted
to say thank you.

01:05:00.464 --> 01:05:02.299
For... for what?

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:03.934
Jenna called me

01:05:03.968 --> 01:05:06.470
and told me what happened
at the bridal store last night.

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:07.604
She made a mistake.

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.606
Everyone
makes mistakes.

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:11.175
That was a big one.

01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:15.079
So you two are...?

01:05:15.112 --> 01:05:16.513
I don't know.

01:05:16.546 --> 01:05:18.648
Actually, I'm on my way
to talk to her right now.

01:05:18.682 --> 01:05:20.450
I-- It's... [sighs]

01:05:20.484 --> 01:05:22.686
It's just a mess.

01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:25.589
I'm sorry.

01:05:25.622 --> 01:05:27.691
Yeah.

01:05:27.724 --> 01:05:30.727
Anyway, um... I finished
the photos for the gym,

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.262
and I'm pretty sure

01:05:32.296 --> 01:05:33.497
Jenna's not gonna
be going back

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.465
to your boot camp
any time soon,

01:05:35.499 --> 01:05:37.001
so just in case,

01:05:37.034 --> 01:05:38.402
I wanted to tell you
how much we appreciated

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:39.736
what you tried to do
for us.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.239
Or, at least, I appreciate it.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.942
I'm sorry things didn't work out
the way they were supposed to.

01:05:47.077 --> 01:05:48.312
I got something for you.

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:51.648
Yeah, well,
you said you liked it,

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:55.252
and, uh, that meant a lot to me,
so I wanted you to have it.

01:05:57.487 --> 01:05:58.588
Nick,

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:00.590
it's beautiful.

01:06:01.725 --> 01:06:03.693
So I guess this means

01:06:03.727 --> 01:06:05.462
you want to take
my cardio-kickboxing class?

01:06:05.495 --> 01:06:07.664
Maybe.

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:10.467
I better go.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.369
Bye.

01:06:17.141 --> 01:06:20.644
I've been sitting here
for an hour, at least,

01:06:20.677 --> 01:06:21.678
trying to figure out

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:24.081
how to start
this conversation.

01:06:24.114 --> 01:06:25.715
Hmm.

01:06:25.749 --> 01:06:27.284
What'd you
come up with?

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:29.419
That I've been
sitting here

01:06:29.453 --> 01:06:31.088
for an hour, at least,

01:06:31.121 --> 01:06:32.122
trying to figure out

01:06:32.156 --> 01:06:33.457
how to start
this conversation.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:35.425
So it's going exactly
according to plan?

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:36.793
Yes. I think
it's going very well.

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:39.296
Good to know.

01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:45.335
I was thinking
about how we met.

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:47.071
I was walking out
of the bank

01:06:47.104 --> 01:06:49.773
and you drove over me
with your bicycle.

01:06:49.806 --> 01:06:51.108
[laughs]

01:06:51.141 --> 01:06:54.044
And we fell into
a heap on the sidewalk,

01:06:54.078 --> 01:06:58.048
and I, literally,
fell into your arms.

01:06:58.082 --> 01:06:59.783
Yes, you did.

01:06:59.816 --> 01:07:02.052
And we both
started laughing.

01:07:02.086 --> 01:07:03.753
Hmm.

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:07.057
We used
to laugh a lot.

01:07:07.091 --> 01:07:09.059
[sighs] Yeah. We did.

01:07:12.662 --> 01:07:14.664
So you gonna go back
to the boot camp?

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:17.101
No. Not today.

01:07:17.134 --> 01:07:19.336
I can't stand
to face them yet,

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:22.706
but I've decided that I'm gonna
go for the last class next week.

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:24.374
Hopefully, they don't
chase me out of the room

01:07:24.408 --> 01:07:25.409
with pitchforks and torches.

01:07:25.442 --> 01:07:26.776
[chuckles] Well,

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:28.845
maybe yoga mats
and medicine balls.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:31.148
It's entirely possible!

01:07:31.181 --> 01:07:33.650
I'm going to apologize
to Lisa.

01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:36.286
Good.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.722
But I'm not gonna apologize
for wanting my--

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:41.191
our wedding...

01:07:41.225 --> 01:07:43.560
for wanting us...

01:07:43.593 --> 01:07:45.729
to be perfect.

01:07:48.132 --> 01:07:51.535
I think you need to take
some time to think about that.

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:55.205
Maybe we can talk
after boot camp next week.

01:07:56.873 --> 01:07:59.209
Yeah, sure.

01:07:59.243 --> 01:08:00.877
Think they can turn
a yoga mat into a torch?

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:03.313
It's entirely possible.

01:08:03.347 --> 01:08:04.848
For you, probable.

01:08:04.881 --> 01:08:06.216
[both chuckling]

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:08.218
You'll be fine.

01:08:08.252 --> 01:08:10.520
[quietly]: Thanks.

01:08:13.157 --> 01:08:14.324
Hey!

01:08:14.358 --> 01:08:15.625
Hi.

01:08:15.659 --> 01:08:16.859
How are you holding up?

01:08:16.893 --> 01:08:17.861
Good!

01:08:17.894 --> 01:08:18.895
Yeah?

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.464
Which is
a total surprise.

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:22.366
