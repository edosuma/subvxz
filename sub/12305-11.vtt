WEBVTT

00:47.699 --> 00:48.992
Think someone followed us here?

00:49.868 --> 00:51.328
No way, man.

01:05.842 --> 01:06.802
Check it out.

01:14.518 --> 01:15.686
You see something?

01:29.658 --> 01:30.450
Eddie!

01:36.582 --> 01:37.958
Get outta here!

02:10.907 --> 02:13.410
Detective Tripp off patrol.

02:13.493 --> 02:14.369
Yeah.

02:14.828 --> 02:17.748
My rotation ended yesterday.
I'm officially back in homicide.

02:17.915 --> 02:18.707
Who we have?

02:18.832 --> 02:22.502
Dockworkers reported gunfire
in this building, Frank.

02:22.544 --> 02:23.837
Saw a couple uniforms back there.

02:23.879 --> 02:25.380
They look pretty shaken up.

02:26.965 --> 02:28.300
Come on inside.

02:43.982 --> 02:45.400
What the hell happened here?

02:45.442 --> 02:46.610
Where are the victims?

02:47.402 --> 02:49.488
They were vaporized, Frank.

02:50.656 --> 02:52.157
Vaporized how?

02:53.742 --> 02:55.118
I don't know,

02:55.619 --> 02:57.079
but it was big.

03:00.374 --> 03:01.375
Horatio.

03:02.501 --> 03:03.627
Who coulda done this?

03:04.962 --> 03:06.255
Not who...

03:07.631 --> 03:08.507
what.

04:23.751 --> 04:26.128
This has all the earmarks
of a gun-smuggling operation,

04:26.170 --> 04:27.963
but why'd they leave
all those guns behind?

04:28.213 --> 04:30.674
Because this was not a robbery, Frank.

04:32.259 --> 04:34.011
What, you mean, A... turf war?

04:34.678 --> 04:36.847
Runners trying to take
out their competition?

04:37.056 --> 04:39.308
Someone is sending a message.

04:39.216 --> 04:40.134
What's the move?

04:40.217 --> 04:42.178
We call the atf right now.

04:43.095 --> 04:45.097
I got friends over there.
I'll take care of it.

05:32.603 --> 05:33.479
You okay?

05:34.230 --> 05:36.440
I've never seen anything like this.

05:37.066 --> 05:38.567
I don't know if we're ever gonna be able

05:38.609 --> 05:40.236
to tell how many people died here today.

05:40.278 --> 05:41.320
There were three.

05:42.029 --> 05:43.155
How can you tell?

05:43.239 --> 05:46.367
Because I found the remains
of three pairs of shoes.

05:49.370 --> 05:51.122
Well, we're gonna get these guys.

05:51.872 --> 05:52.915
We'd better.

05:54.458 --> 05:56.961
Hoping that this can tell
us who our shooters are.

05:58.212 --> 05:59.505
You mean shooter.

06:00.172 --> 06:01.382
You gotta be kidding
me. All of these rounds?

06:01.424 --> 06:03.259
You think they were
all fired from one gun?

06:03.301 --> 06:04.218
One person?

06:04.844 --> 06:06.220
Do you see this round?

06:06.762 --> 06:08.389
It requires no casing,

06:08.514 --> 06:11.726
and every other one I've
picked up is exactly the same.

06:12.018 --> 06:14.687
There is only one weapon I know
that can fire something like this.

06:14.729 --> 06:16.314
It's the dx-4.

06:16.856 --> 06:18.816
Its nickname is "the vaporizer. "

06:20.192 --> 06:21.110
Never heard of it.

06:21.694 --> 06:23.237
That's because it's illegal.

06:23.946 --> 06:25.698
It's an electronic gun.

06:26.449 --> 06:29.702
It has over 200
individually fired barrels.

06:30.202 --> 06:31.537
When the trigger is pulled,

06:31.579 --> 06:35.458
an electronic current hits a
primer on the back of each round.

06:36.375 --> 06:39.795
Because there are no moving
parts,there's nothing to slow it down.

06:39.962 --> 06:43.549
It's capable of firing a hundred
thousand rounds per minute.

06:51.933 --> 06:55.061
I'd seen something like this on paper,
but I didn't know it existed yet.

06:55.144 --> 06:56.312
Well, it does.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.981
Someone in Miami has one.

07:00.024 --> 07:01.359
If we don't find it,

07:02.109 --> 07:04.278
we're gonna see a lot more
crime scenes like this one.

07:04.445 --> 07:05.071
Yeah.

07:08.616 --> 07:10.159
I'll get this to the lab.

07:31.055 --> 07:31.639
Hey.

07:32.056 --> 07:32.598
Hey.

07:32.848 --> 07:35.434
So, have you, uh... have you
seen the crime scene photos?

07:35.476 --> 07:36.185
It was...

07:37.019 --> 07:37.812
a bloodbath.

07:37.853 --> 07:38.854
I heard.

07:39.146 --> 07:41.941
I'm waiting for the results from the
cigarette delko found on the scene.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.359
Hopefully that'll help.

07:43.401 --> 07:45.361
Be able to get any I.D. On the vics?

07:45.403 --> 07:47.154
I'm running them, too, but...

07:47.280 --> 07:48.781
I only have the blood from their shoes.

07:48.823 --> 07:50.283
Hopefully, they're in Codis.

07:50.449 --> 07:52.785
Well,if they're in Codis,
chances are they weren'T...

07:53.035 --> 07:55.496
innocent bystanders,
if you know what I mean.

07:58.833 --> 08:00.376
And you'd be right.

08:00.584 --> 08:01.794
Take a look.

08:02.461 --> 08:05.172
Eddie Padura,Hector Malcas,

08:05.715 --> 08:06.757
Pedro Rupan.

08:06.841 --> 08:08.301
And check out their criminal history.

08:08.342 --> 08:11.178
Trafficking and smuggling firearms.

08:11.512 --> 08:13.639
Makes it official. Gunrunners.

08:13.723 --> 08:16.225
Looks like somebody
wanted to end their career.

08:16.267 --> 08:19.061
And I think I can tell you who.

08:19.729 --> 08:24.150
DNA on the cigarette
belongs to Gabriel Soto?

08:25.234 --> 08:27.945
And look what Gabriel has
in common with our victims.

08:28.779 --> 08:29.614
Yeah.

08:30.156 --> 08:31.449
Gunrunning.

08:37.288 --> 08:39.039
Triple murder,Mr. Soto.

08:39.457 --> 08:40.666
I didn't kill nobody.

08:40.707 --> 08:42.501
Those guys, they work for me.

08:42.751 --> 08:45.630
Then those were your guns at
the warehouse, weren't they?

08:46.047 --> 08:47.048
I'm not saying that.

08:47.089 --> 08:48.341
So what are you saying?

08:48.758 --> 08:49.383
Look,

08:49.550 --> 08:51.802
I got nothing to tell
you. I wasn't even there.

08:51.844 --> 08:53.471
We have evidence that says otherwise.

08:53.554 --> 08:54.430
What evidence?

08:54.472 --> 08:56.349
Your ADN on a cigarette butt.

08:56.682 --> 08:58.851
I do business there. I
could a dropped it days ago.

08:58.893 --> 08:59.769
I'm an antiques dealer.

08:59.810 --> 09:02.021
You deal illegal weapons.

09:02.063 --> 09:02.980
Give me a break.

09:03.230 --> 09:05.066
Your guys were unloading
a shipment of guns

09:05.107 --> 09:07.360
and maybe your buyer didn't
feel like paying for them.

09:10.071 --> 09:11.822
Look, make it easy on
yourself, all right?

09:11.864 --> 09:13.699
Why don't you give us
the name of your buyer?

09:15.910 --> 09:17.912
And why would i cooperate with you?

09:17.954 --> 09:19.747
Because it might get us to a killer.

09:20.915 --> 09:22.375
Don't you want to know
who did this to your men?

09:22.416 --> 09:24.293
I got my own way of dealing with that.

09:24.669 --> 09:25.628
So do I.

09:25.670 --> 09:27.088
You're under arrest.

09:27.421 --> 09:28.214
Take him.

09:29.674 --> 09:30.508
Go ahead.

09:30.633 --> 09:31.842
I'll make bail.

09:32.301 --> 09:34.387
- I'll be out in two hours.
- Just get outta here.

09:37.056 --> 09:38.182
You sergeant Tripp?

09:38.557 --> 09:39.475
Yes, I am.

09:39.558 --> 09:40.601
This is CSI Wolfe.

09:40.685 --> 09:41.686
How you doing?

09:41.769 --> 09:43.104
Sergeant Tripp, agent Thorpe.

09:43.187 --> 09:45.314
- Special task force, us customs.
- Hi.

09:45.439 --> 09:47.817
We were, uh, expecting atf.

09:47.900 --> 09:48.609
Yeah?

09:48.693 --> 09:49.402
Well, they called me.

09:49.443 --> 09:51.696
This is about the smuggling
operation at the docks, right?

09:51.779 --> 09:53.197
Okay, so, uh...

09:53.281 --> 09:54.782
this is a customs operation.

09:54.991 --> 09:56.117
Yes,it was.

09:56.158 --> 09:57.660
Those weapons were
headed to the middle east,

09:57.743 --> 09:59.662
where they'd end up being
used on our own troops.

09:59.704 --> 10:01.622
Well, you forgot to collect the guns.

10:02.290 --> 10:04.250
Well, this mission was
just to shut 'em down.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.043
We planned to send
in a cleanup crew, but

10:06.127 --> 10:07.086
you beat us to it.

10:07.211 --> 10:10.256
Well, don't you think you guys went
a little bit overboard with the, uh,

10:10.298 --> 10:11.924
with the firepower?

10:12.258 --> 10:13.509
What are you talking about?

10:13.592 --> 10:17.054
What I'm talking about is your operation
gunned down three men in cold blood,

10:17.138 --> 10:19.765
and they didn't even
get a single shot off.

10:20.308 --> 10:23.853
Actually, I shouldn't be
discussing an ongoing operation.

10:24.228 --> 10:25.104
Okay.

10:25.271 --> 10:25.855
Fair enough.

10:25.938 --> 10:27.565
What about the dx-4?

10:28.065 --> 10:29.150
The vaporizer?

10:29.609 --> 10:30.318
Yeah.

10:30.776 --> 10:32.278
That gun's illegal in this country.

10:32.445 --> 10:35.072
That's right. So why
were your guys using it?

10:38.993 --> 10:40.161
This wasn't our

10:40.202 --> 10:42.121
operation, strictly speaking.

10:42.622 --> 10:44.665
Customs just had oversight. We, uh...

10:44.707 --> 10:46.292
contracted this one out.

10:46.876 --> 10:49.045
Contract... wha-what is
that supposed to mean?

10:49.086 --> 10:50.880
You used a private security firm.

10:50.921 --> 10:52.882
It's an army for hire.

10:52.923 --> 10:55.217
We've been leaning on
them for tactical support.

10:55.426 --> 10:57.511
They did the port operation themselves.

10:57.595 --> 10:58.846
Did they have a name?

11:15.696 --> 11:17.073
Mr. Lancaster.

11:18.908 --> 11:19.575
Lieutenant.

11:20.826 --> 11:23.037
So you're Peregrine security.

11:23.079 --> 11:24.246
Guns for hire.

11:25.873 --> 11:27.833
I'm afraid there's just
not at lot I can tell you.

11:27.917 --> 11:29.585
And I don't agree.

11:29.669 --> 11:31.796
You have no jurisdiction in this case.

11:31.837 --> 11:33.839
I'm gonna have to ask
you gentlemen to leave.

11:34.048 --> 11:35.549
Oh, we can be right back with a warrant.

11:35.591 --> 11:36.884
Won't do you any good.

11:37.259 --> 11:38.844
You have zero authority
in this building.

11:38.928 --> 11:40.721
Sergeant. Stand down. Please.

11:42.515 --> 11:43.975
Look, I'll try and save you some time.

11:44.558 --> 11:46.560
Yes, that was our
operation this morning,

11:46.602 --> 11:48.396
sanctioned by U.S. Customs.

11:48.437 --> 11:50.106
So you gunned down those men?

11:51.107 --> 11:52.608
There was collateral damage, yes.

11:52.692 --> 11:54.151
And you're admitting to murder.

11:54.568 --> 11:56.487
It isn't murder under the patriot act.

11:56.570 --> 11:58.489
What does the patriot
act have to do with this?

11:58.614 --> 11:59.949
As federal contractors,

12:00.032 --> 12:02.702
Peregrine is protected
from all prosecution

12:02.827 --> 12:04.328
in official operations.

12:04.370 --> 12:05.621
Gentlemen, forgive me,

12:05.663 --> 12:09.166
but from where I'm standing,
you're just common killers.

12:09.917 --> 12:10.710
We're patriots.

12:10.793 --> 12:13.587
Does a patriot use a weapon
that's illegal in this country?

12:14.171 --> 12:16.048
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

12:16.173 --> 12:17.717
We know about the vaporizer.

12:19.468 --> 12:21.053
Look, gentlemen, I understand that it's

12:21.137 --> 12:23.222
difficult for you to
see the big picture,

12:23.347 --> 12:25.891
but the world is much
larger than just Miami.

12:26.225 --> 12:29.020
What we do over here saves
american lives overseas.

12:29.061 --> 12:30.438
I will not

12:30.605 --> 12:32.898
apologize for our mission.

12:33.065 --> 12:34.650
That magic gun of yours,

12:34.692 --> 12:36.360
why don't you just hand it over?

12:37.612 --> 12:38.613
I think we're done here.

12:38.654 --> 12:39.822
Not hardly,

12:39.947 --> 12:41.324
Mr. Lancaster.

12:47.581 --> 12:50.876
<i>Dispatch,this is air-12. We're
responding to Sandcrest Park.</i>

12:50.917 --> 12:55.213
<i>Air-12 be advised,victim is Steve
Lancaster, head of Peregrine security.</i>

12:55.255 --> 12:56.923
<i>Possible DOA.</i>

12:57.049 --> 12:58.634
Thanks...

13:05.057 --> 13:07.559
His name is Steve Lancaster.

13:13.106 --> 13:15.901
You know what? There's no
obvious cause of death here.

13:16.610 --> 13:18.946
There's no blood,
there's no gunshot wound,

13:19.446 --> 13:20.614
there's no stab mark.

13:20.697 --> 13:22.115
Not a mark on him.

13:23.116 --> 13:24.910
It's like he laid down and died.

13:26.578 --> 13:28.288
I'm sure he had help.

13:29.581 --> 13:30.916
Now wait a second. Hey,

13:31.166 --> 13:31.833
Guys!

13:31.959 --> 13:32.501
Sir! Hold on please.

13:32.584 --> 13:33.919
Get your handoff me.

13:34.169 --> 13:35.003
Excuse me.

13:35.087 --> 13:35.963
You cannot be here.

13:36.004 --> 13:38.173
This is a secured
crime scene, all right?

13:38.590 --> 13:41.093
- Hey...
- That SUV is Peregrine property.

13:42.094 --> 13:43.845
I need to collect what's inside.

13:43.887 --> 13:45.305
National security issues.

13:45.347 --> 13:47.057
That's all well and good, pal,

13:47.140 --> 13:49.559
but murder investigation trumps
whatever it is you're doing,

13:49.601 --> 13:50.477
so you're gonna have to

13:50.644 --> 13:51.895
get lost, okay?

13:53.313 --> 13:57.234
Get behind the yellow tape or
I'll take you into custody myself.

14:07.452 --> 14:08.412
this isn't over.

14:08.453 --> 14:10.122
Not by a long shot.

14:10.372 --> 14:11.248
Beat it.

14:15.836 --> 14:16.878
Mr. Wolfe,

14:18.588 --> 14:20.090
let's get Alexx out here.

15:06.678 --> 15:07.971
What have you got?

15:09.139 --> 15:10.849
I found an unspent round on the seat,

15:10.933 --> 15:13.268
and I think I've got Lancaster's laptop.

15:13.393 --> 15:15.687
Wonder if that's what peregrine
was so hot to get their hands on.

15:15.771 --> 15:17.439
Check out this tattoo.

15:19.066 --> 15:21.902
Looks like our mercenary
used to be a navy seal.

15:23.654 --> 15:25.155
I didn't see any signs
of a struggle in there.

15:25.197 --> 15:26.865
You think he would have fought back.

15:27.324 --> 15:29.034
I think I know why he didn'T.

15:31.912 --> 15:32.871
Burn marks.

15:33.121 --> 15:34.247
My guess,

15:34.373 --> 15:36.541
someone hit him with a stun gun.

15:42.756 --> 15:44.841
yeah, but that wouldn't be
powerful enough to kill him.

15:45.300 --> 15:45.968
No,

15:46.176 --> 15:47.970
but it could knock you
out for a good ten minutes.

15:48.011 --> 15:50.097
That's long enough to finish up the job.

15:50.264 --> 15:52.432
So they hit him with a stun
gun and then strangle him?

15:52.474 --> 15:53.100
No.

15:53.684 --> 15:55.060
His lips aren't blue,

15:55.102 --> 15:57.062
no signs of petechia.

15:58.021 --> 15:59.231
So what are you thinking?

16:00.232 --> 16:01.692
These kind of people,

16:02.526 --> 16:04.861
they want a murder to be invisible.

16:05.612 --> 16:06.947
Like an assassination.

16:06.989 --> 16:07.781
Exactly.

16:08.448 --> 16:10.909
And I have a hunch how they did it.

16:37.644 --> 16:40.480
Natalia told me that you had
a crackerjack autopsy going on,

16:40.564 --> 16:42.566
but that you wouldn't tell
her what you were doing.

16:42.608 --> 16:45.068
Calleigh, you know I don't
like to jinx my theories

16:45.110 --> 16:47.446
before I've had a
chance to test 'em out.

16:47.779 --> 16:49.323
But you came at the right time.

16:49.364 --> 16:50.532
So what killed him?

16:50.574 --> 16:51.783
A bubble.

16:52.242 --> 16:53.201
Come again?

16:53.327 --> 16:54.411
If I'm right,

16:54.453 --> 16:56.330
it was an air embolism

16:56.371 --> 16:57.873
that took our soldier down.

16:58.206 --> 17:01.460
So you mean like when a person
gets an air bubble in their vein?

17:01.501 --> 17:02.502
That's right.

17:02.628 --> 17:05.255
Travels to the heart,
gets stuck in the valves

17:05.380 --> 17:07.049
and stops the heart from beating.

17:07.089 --> 17:11.678
Only way to know for sure is
to submerge the heart in water.

17:11.762 --> 17:13.512
If there's air inside,

17:13.555 --> 17:15.598
it'll float to the surface.

17:18.310 --> 17:22.439
I am now going to cut
the right ventricle.

17:26.108 --> 17:27.402
And there's your killer bubble.

17:27.444 --> 17:28.779
So this was no accident.

17:28.862 --> 17:30.030
No way.

17:30.197 --> 17:33.116
Circulatory system is airtight.

17:33.200 --> 17:37.621
The only way to get air in your
veins is to have it forced in.

17:38.914 --> 17:40.582
Like with a syringe.

17:48.799 --> 17:50.258
So somebody killed him.

17:50.509 --> 17:54.638
Problem is you are looking
at the perfect murder.

17:54.763 --> 17:58.850
It is almost impossible to
trace this back to the killer.

18:00.018 --> 18:01.895
What about the injection site?

18:01.937 --> 18:03.480
Could you find something there?

18:04.606 --> 18:05.607
Maybe.

18:06.525 --> 18:09.528
Oh, this killer was so smart.

18:22.332 --> 18:23.625
Lieutenant Caine,

18:23.875 --> 18:25.085
Darren Butler,

18:25.294 --> 18:27.045
current CEO of Peregrine security.

18:27.129 --> 18:28.171
Current CEO?

18:28.213 --> 18:29.840
Well, that didn't take long, did it?

18:29.923 --> 18:32.259
Steve was a good leader,
lieutenant, but we move on.

18:32.342 --> 18:33.760
Can't distract from the mission.

18:33.844 --> 18:35.971
Was killing Steve a part of the mission?

18:37.139 --> 18:38.181
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:38.265 --> 18:39.850
Steve was murdered.

18:41.059 --> 18:42.477
And how does that relate to Peregrine?

18:42.519 --> 18:46.106
We found a DX4 round in Lancaster's suv.

18:46.189 --> 18:48.692
Is that where he was
storing the vaporizer?

18:48.900 --> 18:50.694
I don't know anything about that.

18:51.278 --> 18:53.739
But if Steve was involved with
the use of that weapon, then

18:53.822 --> 18:54.990
he crossed the line.

18:55.824 --> 18:56.908
Of course,

18:57.451 --> 18:59.202
we'll never know now. He's dead.

18:59.244 --> 19:01.246
Yes, how convenient for you.

19:01.872 --> 19:03.415
Lieutenant, off the record,

19:03.957 --> 19:06.460
you're looking at us when
you should be looking outside.

19:06.627 --> 19:08.587
So you're saying steve had enemies.

19:08.670 --> 19:09.463
Plenty.

19:10.380 --> 19:12.257
I'm gonna need those names.

19:12.341 --> 19:14.676
I'm sorry, but those
files are confidential.

19:15.218 --> 19:16.845
You'll just have to
find them on your own.

19:16.929 --> 19:18.180
Yes, and I will.

19:18.263 --> 19:20.557
And a word to the wise, Mr. Butler,

19:20.641 --> 19:23.060
your name better not be amongst them.

19:44.289 --> 19:45.374
Oh, yeah.

19:45.791 --> 19:48.627
Got a nice juicy partial
right here on the clasp.

19:48.710 --> 19:49.670
Nice.

19:50.212 --> 19:52.589
Hopefully, that will give us
our killer and not our victim.

20:27.249 --> 20:29.209
Here we go. James reilly.

20:29.418 --> 20:30.502
Any priors?

20:30.877 --> 20:32.546
No, his record's pristine.

20:33.755 --> 20:35.340
Why is he in AFIS then?

20:36.216 --> 20:37.342
Says he was in the navy.

20:37.384 --> 20:40.762
All military personnel get
fingerprinted when they enlist.

20:42.347 --> 20:43.932
Steve Lancaster was a navy seal.

20:43.974 --> 20:45.434
I wonder if they knew each other.

20:45.684 --> 20:47.394
There's only one way to find out.

20:51.940 --> 20:54.318
Look, I'm really sorry
that Steve is dead,

20:54.776 --> 20:56.528
but I don't see what
that has to do with me.

20:56.570 --> 20:59.197
We found your fingerprint
on his watchband.

20:59.573 --> 21:01.074
Oh, come on. Are you kidding?

21:02.075 --> 21:03.785
Is that why I'm here?

21:04.536 --> 21:05.787
I ran into steve today.

21:05.829 --> 21:09.041
It must have happened when
I, when we shook hands.

21:09.249 --> 21:11.418
I was on my way to see
a client, and we just

21:11.501 --> 21:12.753
bumped into each other.

21:16.089 --> 21:17.507
Steve Lancaster.

21:19.968 --> 21:20.677
Reilly?

21:22.346 --> 21:23.347
Hey, you got a minute?

21:23.388 --> 21:24.806
You want to grab something to eat?

21:25.891 --> 21:27.601
Actually, I can't,man. I got to run.

21:31.688 --> 21:33.815
He seemed like he was in a rush.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.778
I haven't seen Steve
since I left Peregrine.

21:37.903 --> 21:39.738
So you worked at Peregrine security?

21:39.780 --> 21:40.864
For a while.

21:41.198 --> 21:44.117
Steve brought me in to set
up the computer systems.

21:44.159 --> 21:45.160
Why'd you leave?

21:46.662 --> 21:47.829
Well, I...

21:47.913 --> 21:49.831
I guess I just didn't
want the life anymore.

21:49.998 --> 21:53.543
After all the years in the
navy and then Peregrine,

21:53.794 --> 21:56.046
I just got tired of playing war.

21:56.505 --> 21:58.131
I run a computer repair firm now.

21:58.215 --> 22:00.175
Where did you go after you saw Steve?

22:01.301 --> 22:02.678
I went back to the office.

22:02.719 --> 22:04.388
You can ask my secretary.

22:06.181 --> 22:07.015
I will.

22:16.817 --> 22:18.527
Is that Lancaster's laptop?

22:18.568 --> 22:20.821
I thought it came up empty
for any evidence of the killer.

22:20.862 --> 22:22.698
Yeah, well, what's why I
wanted to crack it open,

22:22.739 --> 22:25.701
see if we got any information that
will point us in the right direction.

22:26.076 --> 22:29.204
Well, I'll take any
direction at this point.

22:29.705 --> 22:31.873
I heard you talked
to Reilly's secretary.

22:32.082 --> 22:35.460
Yeah, she confirmed his story,
but she may be covering for him.

22:36.795 --> 22:39.047
Wait. Will you pop open that report?

22:40.173 --> 22:40.882
Sure.

22:42.634 --> 22:45.887
"Operation black market status. "

22:46.054 --> 22:49.600
That sounds like plans
for a military action.

22:50.142 --> 22:52.019
What does "asset out of the bag," mean?

22:52.394 --> 22:55.105
Asset in military jargon,
that means a target.

22:55.647 --> 22:59.568
"Three bogies in play"
means three enemies involved.

23:00.485 --> 23:03.614
Three is the number of victims at
the warehouse shooting this morning.

23:03.905 --> 23:05.616
I think these are the plans.

23:06.325 --> 23:07.659
All right, take a look at this.

23:07.701 --> 23:10.495
"Mission status: Stage one incomplete. "

23:11.246 --> 23:15.042
Well, if this morning was stage one,
I wonder what else they have planned.

23:16.877 --> 23:17.919
What are you doing?

23:19.338 --> 23:20.547
What are you doing?

23:24.134 --> 23:26.929
I'm not doing anything. The
laptop's doing this on its own.

23:27.095 --> 23:29.389
Someone's purging the hard
drive. They're doing it remotely.

23:29.431 --> 23:31.183
They were just waiting for
us to turn the computer on.

23:31.224 --> 23:31.892
Turn it off.

23:31.934 --> 23:34.019
I can't. They're overriding it.

23:35.395 --> 23:37.064
Well, can you figure out who's doing it?

23:37.272 --> 23:39.566
I'm transmitting an
output signal, but...

23:40.233 --> 23:41.610
once the computer's wiped out,

23:41.652 --> 23:44.154
all trace of whoever is
doing this will be gone.

23:47.240 --> 23:49.201
I'm synched in to their
satellite transmission.

23:49.242 --> 23:50.994
It's looking for a source.

23:51.745 --> 23:54.790
We have to hurry. It's wiped
out 75% of the hard drive.

23:56.667 --> 23:58.877
It's narrowed it down to south Florida.

23:59.127 --> 24:00.504
85%. Come on.

24:00.587 --> 24:01.546
We're running out of time.

24:01.588 --> 24:02.881
We're almost there.

24:12.015 --> 24:13.016
It's gone.

24:15.477 --> 24:16.478
Wait a minute.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.691
An address.

24:21.358 --> 24:23.235
That's the address to
Peregrine's headquarters.

24:25.988 --> 24:28.031
They wiped out their own computer.

24:28.949 --> 24:31.118
They're covering up
something really big.

24:38.458 --> 24:41.128
You've been tampering with
the evidence, Mr. Butler.

24:41.837 --> 24:43.630
It's not tampering

24:43.880 --> 24:45.841
when you're sanitizing
your own computer files.

24:45.882 --> 24:48.385
It is if you're interfering
in a murder investigation.

24:48.427 --> 24:51.471
We have to insure our information
doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

24:51.513 --> 24:52.848
You mean like mine?

24:53.849 --> 24:57.060
There was nothing in there that
would have pertained to Steve's death.

24:57.519 --> 24:59.187
Mr. Lancaster was killed

24:59.229 --> 25:03.275
because the operation black market
wasn't completed this morning.

25:03.442 --> 25:04.735
You don't know what
you're talking about.

25:04.776 --> 25:05.986
Educate me.

25:07.738 --> 25:10.574
Okay, lieutenant. You
were right about Lancaster.

25:11.033 --> 25:13.744
He exceeded our protocols, and
used the dx-4 in the dock operation.

25:13.785 --> 25:15.245
The vaporizer.

25:15.454 --> 25:17.164
We were going to turn
over that gun to the feds,

25:17.247 --> 25:19.166
but it was never returned to base.

25:19.583 --> 25:23.462
So the mission is incomplete
until we reacquire the vaporizer.

25:24.129 --> 25:26.423
So it was in his SUV.

25:26.673 --> 25:28.592
Where it was stolen
when he was murdered.

25:35.140 --> 25:38.018
You're telling me that the most
dangerous weapon on the planet

25:38.101 --> 25:40.395
is loose on the streets of Miami.

26:08.617 --> 26:09.910
I'm sorry, do I...

26:09.993 --> 26:11.119
do I smell pork?

26:11.161 --> 26:11.995
You do.

26:12.079 --> 26:13.121
I'm using pig flesh

26:13.163 --> 26:15.707
because it's the closest thing
to human flesh that I could find.

26:15.791 --> 26:18.835
I'm trying to tie Peregrine
to the Lancaster murder.

26:18.919 --> 26:20.545
I didn't know that stun
guns were traceable.

26:20.629 --> 26:24.216
Well, it isn't like a regular gun,
but if the mark is unique enough...

26:24.257 --> 26:25.676
I mean, for example,

26:25.717 --> 26:28.428
this is the Lancaster stun bite.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.847
You can see how the
prongs are close together.

26:30.889 --> 26:31.306
Yeah.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.600
If I can match this model

26:33.684 --> 26:36.436
to one of these, I think we
might be able to find our killer.

26:39.147 --> 26:40.399
It's what I suspected.

26:40.524 --> 26:41.566
Meet the Sentry

26:41.650 --> 26:43.110
the world's smallest stun gun.

26:43.402 --> 26:44.778
You're telling me that that

26:44.861 --> 26:46.822
tiny thing took down a 200-pound guy?

26:46.905 --> 26:48.782
Well, it kicks out a million volts.

26:49.658 --> 26:50.450
You know, it's funny

26:50.492 --> 26:52.703
I would think those Peregrine
guys were such a boy's club,

26:52.786 --> 26:55.122
they wouldn't use such
a girly little weapon.

26:55.497 --> 26:58.667
Well, I only ended up testing it
against government issue stun guns,

26:58.709 --> 27:01.003
and I figured that's what
Peregrine would be using.

27:01.044 --> 27:02.754
What kind of government agencies?

27:03.213 --> 27:05.757
State Department, customs agents.

27:07.134 --> 27:08.218
Customs agents?

27:08.260 --> 27:09.052
Yeah.

27:11.513 --> 27:12.597
Where you going?

27:17.894 --> 27:19.146
What's this all about, Wolfe?

27:21.314 --> 27:22.816
It's about your stun gun.

27:23.442 --> 27:24.192
Excuse me?

27:24.276 --> 27:25.777
You carry a Sentry, is that right?

27:26.111 --> 27:26.903
Yes.

27:27.320 --> 27:28.530
They're issued to us.

27:29.397 --> 27:31.399
So Steve Lancaster's murder

27:31.566 --> 27:34.736
was that a State-sponsored
assassination or

27:35.487 --> 27:37.155
did you do that on your own?

27:38.114 --> 27:39.950
What the hell are you talking about?

27:40.116 --> 27:42.452
Lancaster was murdered with a sentry.

27:43.245 --> 27:45.664
The very same model stun gun you carry.

27:46.248 --> 27:48.875
And why would I have a
reason to kill Lancaster?

27:49.876 --> 27:52.170
Well, the vaporizer.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.798
I'm trying to stop that
weapon just like you.

27:54.839 --> 27:55.715
Now you are.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.259
See, you're the liaison for Peregrine,

27:57.300 --> 28:00.303
but you didn't know they were using that
weapon until I told you, is that right?

28:01.137 --> 28:03.139
I can't be held responsible
for what they do.

28:03.181 --> 28:04.599
Well, your supervisor can.

28:04.641 --> 28:05.809
When it gets out in the public

28:05.850 --> 28:09.271
that you hired a company to do your
dirty work that's using illegal weapons,

28:10.355 --> 28:11.731
you're gonna take the fall.

28:14.442 --> 28:17.487
I think you killed
Lancaster to get the gun.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.573
I think if there was no gun...

28:21.825 --> 28:22.868
no problem.

28:24.661 --> 28:25.912
You got nothing to base that on.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.038
Is that right?

28:27.497 --> 28:30.667
Every time you use that stun gun,
the date and time is recorded.

28:40.468 --> 28:41.678
Why don't you hand it over?

28:43.179 --> 28:43.930
Here.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.310
But don't let my supervisor hear.

28:48.476 --> 28:51.229
My job is already on the
line for how this was handled.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.064
If they hear that I'm now a suspect...

28:53.106 --> 28:54.608
If this tests positive...

28:57.110 --> 28:59.946
your job is going to be
the least of your worries.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.597
Okay, okay, what's wrong?

29:26.014 --> 29:27.557
I was just...

29:28.558 --> 29:31.519
I was convinced that our
customs agent killed Lancaster,

29:31.561 --> 29:33.104
but she didn't fire her stun gun.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.272
She didn't even fire it once.

29:34.397 --> 29:35.565
So, uh...

29:36.858 --> 29:38.401
we don't have a suspect.

29:38.944 --> 29:40.237
Well, baby...

29:40.445 --> 29:42.113
maybe this will help you out.

29:42.697 --> 29:43.365
What is this?

29:43.406 --> 29:44.533
You tell me.

29:44.699 --> 29:47.244
They look like black specks.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.163
Where did you find these?

29:50.622 --> 29:52.666
In our victim's eye.

29:52.958 --> 29:56.419
I found the injection
site- in his retinal vein.

29:56.795 --> 30:00.549
A syringe was the last
thing our soldier saw.

30:05.595 --> 30:06.680
Alexx...

30:08.139 --> 30:09.307
this is huge.

30:09.474 --> 30:12.811
If trace can tell us what these
black specks are, we may have our man.

30:20.193 --> 30:22.279
Steve Lancaster, Mr. Reilly.

30:22.404 --> 30:23.446
What about him?

30:23.905 --> 30:24.823
You killed him.

30:25.782 --> 30:29.703
We found out about an interesting tool
you use to service computer equipment.

30:31.037 --> 30:32.622
The next time you kill
somebody with a syringe,

30:32.664 --> 30:35.041
you should try cleaning
the toner out first.

30:44.885 --> 30:46.344
You know what, this is harassment.

30:46.386 --> 30:49.180
I am not the only
computers salesman in Miami.

30:49.222 --> 30:50.307
But you had a motive.

30:50.640 --> 30:51.808
And what is that motive?

30:52.183 --> 30:53.268
Revenge.

30:54.477 --> 30:55.228
I'm out of here.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.730
Sit down, Mr. Reilly.

31:01.776 --> 31:04.863
Now, we ran into a security firewall
with your employment records.

31:04.946 --> 31:07.240
So we called in a few favors
at the State Department.

31:07.324 --> 31:10.744
And it turns out that you didn't
quit at Peregrine, you were fired.

31:10.785 --> 31:12.287
I was not fired.

31:12.913 --> 31:15.457
You cannot fire the
founder of a company.

31:15.498 --> 31:17.334
Lancaster founded Peregrine.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.503
That's what it says on
the revised brochures.

31:20.629 --> 31:22.547
Peregrine was my idea.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.717
I came up with it back in the Seals.

31:25.759 --> 31:27.344
That's when I met Steve.

31:27.677 --> 31:30.055
I brought him on as a partner.

31:35.101 --> 31:36.811
So how did he force you out?

31:39.147 --> 31:42.567
I was spending so much time
engineering courses in other countries,

31:43.360 --> 31:44.694
I didn't see the one
he was pulling on me.

31:44.778 --> 31:46.404
So you assassinated him.

31:56.540 --> 31:59.417
Lancaster betrayed Peregrine.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.965
It was a noble idea and he
turned it into a killing machine.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.801
Should have held true
to your own ideals.

32:11.388 --> 32:12.931
The world is better off.

32:16.643 --> 32:17.936
What the hell do you want?

32:36.371 --> 32:38.123
At least I completed my mission.

32:38.999 --> 32:41.334
Was part of that mission
to steal the DX-4?

32:42.836 --> 32:44.004
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.046
The gun...

32:45.505 --> 32:47.048
you took it from Lancaster's SUV.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.258
No,I didn't.

32:49.885 --> 32:50.886
I swear.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.724
Someone must have
stolen it after I left.

32:55.932 --> 32:57.475
I hope so for your sake.

32:57.726 --> 32:58.518
Take him.

33:01.104 --> 33:04.107
Eric, let's take
another look at that SUV.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.254
Hey.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.590
I got a human hair...

33:29.382 --> 33:30.508
with a bulb.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.093
Beautiful.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.096
I'll have Natalia and put a name to it.

33:48.610 --> 33:50.028
Gabriel Soto.

33:51.613 --> 33:52.572
No, man.

33:52.697 --> 33:53.907
You got the wrong guy.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.159
I'm here to see Soto about a job.

33:56.326 --> 33:57.369
Well, where is he?

33:57.410 --> 33:58.411
He's right there.

34:01.122 --> 34:04.501
You made bail, Soto, but you
might be going right back in.

34:04.793 --> 34:06.294
You hiring new staff?

34:06.545 --> 34:09.714
I need to replace the men I lost
after Peregrine wiped them out.

34:09.755 --> 34:12.926
You need more manpower now that
you have the vaporizer to sell.

34:13.969 --> 34:15.929
That'll be a little difficult
since I don't have it.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.306
Yeah, well, I can put
you in Lancaster's SUV,

34:18.348 --> 34:19.891
exactly where the gun was stolen from.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.018
And how can you do that?

34:22.143 --> 34:23.562
Because I found your hair

34:23.603 --> 34:24.646
in the front seat.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.359
You deliver that
dx-4,I bring the buyer.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.569
We'll split it 50-50.

34:31.902 --> 34:33.822
And why does he want the vaporizer?

34:33.989 --> 34:35.532
He wants to mass produce it.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.117
He's willing to pay big for it.

34:38.326 --> 34:40.620
Well,if that's the case, then
I'll just contact him myself.

34:40.661 --> 34:41.663
You can't do that.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.623
He only deals with me.

34:44.708 --> 34:45.750
Not if you're dead.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.675
Oh, man.

34:53.842 --> 34:55.176
I didn't steal anything.

34:55.260 --> 34:55.927
Look...

34:56.136 --> 34:58.513
I met with Lancaster, you know, to talk.

34:58.555 --> 35:01.266
You were just chatting it up
with the guy who killed your men?

35:01.850 --> 35:03.059
No, I don't think so.

35:03.894 --> 35:05.270
It was before that.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.773
I was looking to buy the
vaporizer gun from him, okay?

35:09.399 --> 35:11.193
I could retire off the profit from that.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.320
Yeah, by selling it to our enemies.

35:13.486 --> 35:14.738
Nothing personal.

35:14.905 --> 35:16.281
It's just business.

35:17.824 --> 35:18.909
Get down!

36:10.418 --> 36:12.128
Is it personal now, Soto?

36:14.256 --> 36:15.423
This guy's dead.

36:15.757 --> 36:17.384
That bullet was meant for you.

36:39.883 --> 36:42.010
The shots were fired from over there.

36:43.803 --> 36:45.597
I've got a. 308 casing.

36:45.763 --> 36:47.849
This didn't come from the vaporizer.

36:50.685 --> 36:51.978
You know what's weird?

36:52.437 --> 36:54.898
I don't see any of your
bullet strikes here.

36:55.190 --> 36:57.609
Yeah, I tried to get a
bead on the shooters, but...

36:57.942 --> 36:59.819
by the time I did, they took off.

37:02.572 --> 37:06.242
You know whatever is said between
us stays between us, right?

37:08.745 --> 37:10.038
Did you freeze?

37:12.749 --> 37:13.875
No,I didn't.

37:15.210 --> 37:16.711
It's just when the, uh...

37:17.670 --> 37:20.089
when he started shooting,
it took me back to that day.

37:20.882 --> 37:21.800
I,uh...

37:23.301 --> 37:25.512
I felt like I was getting
shot all over again.

37:26.596 --> 37:29.057
Well,why don't we just
focus on the here and now?

37:29.265 --> 37:30.809
We've got a shooter to catch.

37:39.234 --> 37:41.069
Looks like there are
more casings up there.

37:42.028 --> 37:43.863
Concealment. Higher position.

37:44.072 --> 37:44.948
It's where I'd want to be.

37:59.629 --> 38:00.713
I'll check it out.

38:38.334 --> 38:39.752
You find the casings?

38:39.794 --> 38:41.045
Yeah. Three.

38:42.255 --> 38:44.090
The shooter found himself
a nice perch up here,

38:44.132 --> 38:46.092
but he wasn't too careful getting down.

38:46.176 --> 38:48.219
Really! Did you get a print?

38:48.803 --> 38:50.555
Sure did. Just one, but...

38:50.972 --> 38:52.348
one's enough, right?

38:59.981 --> 39:01.441
How do you know I took the shot?

39:01.483 --> 39:04.777
We recovered your fingerprints
from the sniper perch, Patrick.

39:15.079 --> 39:16.581
Soto was a sanctioned target.

39:16.623 --> 39:18.583
As you know,I'm shielded from
prosecution under the Patriot Act.

39:18.666 --> 39:20.794
I'd hate to rain on
your parade, my friend,

39:20.835 --> 39:23.254
but Soto, as it turns
out, was not the victim.

39:23.296 --> 39:25.089
You killed an innocent man.

39:25.131 --> 39:26.466
So, currently,

39:26.591 --> 39:28.426
you're not shielded by anything.

39:35.725 --> 39:37.435
Intel said Soto was there.

39:37.477 --> 39:38.603
He was.

39:54.035 --> 39:55.912
You killed an innocent man.

40:05.380 --> 40:06.756
Why did they want him dead?

40:09.050 --> 40:11.678
So Soto's buyer would
deal directly with us.

40:11.803 --> 40:12.887
We mobilized in the warehouse.

40:12.929 --> 40:14.556
Okay, let me rephrase it.

40:14.597 --> 40:15.932
Where is the gun?

40:16.933 --> 40:18.268
Where is it right now?

40:18.476 --> 40:20.019
We removed the asset from the SUV

40:20.061 --> 40:22.147
the moment we knew Lancaster was down.

40:30.280 --> 40:32.240
Where is the location of the sale?

40:32.323 --> 40:34.242
I don't question my superiors.

40:34.325 --> 40:35.285
I get my orders,

40:35.410 --> 40:36.953
- I act on them.
- Patrick.

40:36.995 --> 40:38.621
I believe in the cause, lieutenant,

40:38.663 --> 40:41.541
that we're defenders of
liberty, overseas and at home...

40:41.583 --> 40:42.876
wherever good soldiers are needed,

40:42.917 --> 40:44.294
- that's where we are.
- So be a good soldier, Patrick...

40:44.335 --> 40:47.130
be a good soldier and get me the
location of the sale. Where is it?

40:47.172 --> 40:48.631
I don't know.

40:48.756 --> 40:49.632
Patrick...

40:50.258 --> 40:52.844
if you don't give me the location,
innocent people are gonna die.

40:52.886 --> 40:53.470
Look at me.

40:53.511 --> 40:54.846
- I don't know.
- Look at me.

40:54.929 --> 40:56.222
Innocent people are gonna die.

40:56.264 --> 40:58.183
- And I know that you...
- I don't know. Only Butler knows.

40:58.266 --> 41:00.268
don't want that to happen,do you?

41:00.393 --> 41:01.978
That's not who you are.

41:04.439 --> 41:05.482
Only Butler knows.

41:05.523 --> 41:06.774
Then give me Butler.

41:06.983 --> 41:08.318
All I can give you is his computer.

41:08.359 --> 41:09.360
Do that.

41:33.927 --> 41:34.928
Butler!

41:35.386 --> 41:37.472
Have you seen this
weapon used in the field?

41:37.680 --> 41:39.182
On several targets...

41:39.349 --> 41:41.434
completely vaporize a human.

41:41.684 --> 41:43.728
Most beautiful thing to behold.

41:46.231 --> 41:48.024
You said we'd be left alone.

41:49.234 --> 41:51.653
This'll just give me
a chance to demonstrate

41:51.945 --> 41:53.988
what the vaporizer can do.

42:08.336 --> 42:09.879
All right,let's go. I'll finish it off.

42:09.921 --> 42:11.548
Get the ammo on the plane.

42:29.691 --> 42:31.860
And that's with only
half the barrels engaged.

42:49.752 --> 42:52.464
You're on the losing side
of this one, lieutenant.

42:55.341 --> 42:58.303
I could fire a thousand rounds
before you get a shot off...

43:09.898 --> 43:11.316
Well, apparently...

43:12.901 --> 43:14.652
...it only takes the one.
