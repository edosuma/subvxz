00:01.501 --> 00:03.200
Ooh, it hurts!

00:06.000 --> 00:09.934
Please... Help me.

00:10.033 --> 00:12.300
Oh, my god! Stop!

00:12.367 --> 00:15.133
Take me to a hospital.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.300
Aah!

00:19.367 --> 00:23.133
Help me!

00:23.200 --> 00:24.133
Stop!

00:24.200 --> 00:26.267
Oh, my god, stop!

00:26.334 --> 00:28.868
Ohh! Ohh!

00:31.367 --> 00:33.100
Ohh!

00:38.701 --> 00:40.467
Is everything ok?

00:49.901 --> 00:52.167
Oh, god.

00:53.234 --> 00:55.234
Oh, god.

00:56.567 --> 00:59.501
Hey, you.

00:59.567 --> 01:02.033
How are you doing?

01:20.868 --> 01:22.200
Give me the baby.

01:22.267 --> 01:24.300
Wait.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.734
It's a girl.

01:33.801 --> 01:36.467
Don't! No! Let me just--

01:36.534 --> 01:39.200
Give me back my baby!

01:50.900 --> 01:52.367
What's next?

01:52.434 --> 01:55.301
Baton Rouge thinks they have a
white supremacist problem.

01:55.367 --> 01:57.201
What's your take?

01:57.267 --> 01:58.234
Really?

01:58.301 --> 01:59.700
Yeah, I'd like to hear it.

01:59.767 --> 02:01.433
We're dealing with
an individual, not a group.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.667
Why?

02:02.734 --> 02:04.167
The angry letters.

02:04.234 --> 02:07.834
The writer switches pronouns
from plural to singular.

02:07.901 --> 02:09.667
<i>"We are a heavily
armed militia,"</i>

02:09.734 --> 02:12.467
<i>followed by, "I will be
forced to take action."</i>

02:12.533 --> 02:14.500
Good. Send it back
to the police with our analysis.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.334
What else?

02:16.400 --> 02:18.600
You need to be somewhere?

02:18.667 --> 02:20.734
Um...Henry's just going
through a clingy stage.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.167
It's one less 3 a.m. diaper
change when I put him down.

02:23.234 --> 02:25.134
Why don't you go home?

02:25.201 --> 02:27.201
Oh, no, no, no. We only have 5 more
cases. We can crank 'em out.

02:27.268 --> 02:29.034
We can do this tomorrow.
Please go home.

02:29.101 --> 02:30.800
Ok. Thank you.

02:30.867 --> 02:32.967
I just have one last distribution
and I'm out of here.

02:33.034 --> 02:34.201
Good night.

02:34.268 --> 02:35.800
Good night.

02:43.700 --> 02:46.034
Chief Strauss.

02:46.101 --> 02:49.134
Aaron.
We need to talk.

02:49.201 --> 02:50.767
Close the door.

03:02.101 --> 03:05.368
I need to review this
with the director.

03:08.734 --> 03:10.167
Agent Jareau.

03:11.368 --> 03:13.368
Ma'am.

03:24.067 --> 03:25.967
Hotch.

03:26.901 --> 03:28.334
Yes?

03:28.400 --> 03:30.500
Is everything ok?

03:32.667 --> 03:34.034
Yes, everything's fine.

03:34.101 --> 03:36.134
Good night.

03:37.234 --> 03:39.034
Good night.

04:17.901 --> 04:18.934
Reid, what did i miss?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.500
Oh, man, you're not
gonna believe this.

04:20.567 --> 04:23.533
Some moron just posted a blog called
"What would Carl Sagan do?"

04:23.600 --> 04:25.834
No, Reid, the case.
What's the case?

04:25.901 --> 04:27.167
What are you talking about?

04:27.234 --> 04:28.467
These emails from Hotch.
"Take a look at this,"

04:28.533 --> 04:29.667
"New case to review."

04:29.734 --> 04:30.767
Emails from Hotch?

04:30.834 --> 04:32.834
I didn't get any emails
from Hotch, did I?

04:32.901 --> 04:35.034
Nothing.

04:39.067 --> 04:41.034
Come in.

04:41.101 --> 04:43.134
Did you, uh, get a chance
to look at the files?

04:43.201 --> 04:44.433
I just got them.
What's so important

04:44.500 --> 04:46.134
you couldn't send it
to the rest of the team?

04:46.201 --> 04:48.334
I just needed
a second pair of eyes.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.734
I'll review it right now.
Just give me an hour.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.134
That's not necessary.

04:52.201 --> 04:53.734
We're ready.

04:58.734 --> 05:00.901
Kristie Taylor,
runaway, drug addict,

05:00.967 --> 05:02.467
reported missing from
Farmington, New Mexico

05:02.533 --> 05:03.800
3 years ago.

05:03.867 --> 05:06.001
Yesterday, she turned up
off a freeway

05:06.067 --> 05:07.901
outside of Rio Rancho.

05:07.967 --> 05:11.001
Sexual assault combined with ligaturemarks
on her wrists and ankles.

05:11.067 --> 05:12.067
She was asphyxiated.

05:12.134 --> 05:14.533
3 victims in 5 years.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.167
All the women
are connected by marks.

05:16.234 --> 05:18.067
He likes chains.

05:18.134 --> 05:20.001
Definite sexual sadist.

05:20.067 --> 05:22.867
He sticks to his type. 16- to
19-year-old girls, all blond.

05:22.934 --> 05:24.567
Hangs on to them
for a while, too.

05:24.634 --> 05:25.834
Look at this.
Average of 2 years

05:25.901 --> 05:27.334
between abducting them
and killing them.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.067
Low body count,
long time frame.

05:29.134 --> 05:31.001
This guy's in control
of his urges.

05:31.067 --> 05:32.334
Too controlled.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.600
Sadists need new victims,
new ways to torture.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.334
There are a lot of guys
out there who like chains.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.600
Are we sure this is
the same unsub?

05:38.667 --> 05:40.334
Kristie Taylor's
autopsy report

05:40.400 --> 05:43.067
also indicates a second
connection between these victims.

05:43.134 --> 05:44.567
She was pregnant.

05:44.634 --> 05:47.368
She'd given birth. Very soon
after, the unsub killed her.

05:47.433 --> 05:48.800
How soon after?

05:48.867 --> 05:50.067
Minutes.

05:50.434 --> 05:53.134
This unsub isn't your
typical sexual sadist.

05:53.201 --> 05:54.601
Captivity and assault
we've seen before.

05:54.668 --> 05:56.833
What we haven't seen
is this signature--

05:56.900 --> 06:00.467
The role he forces these women
to fulfill before he kills them.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.733
Motherhood.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.067
Journalist
William D. Tammeus wrote,

06:43.133 --> 06:45.500
"You don't really
understand human nature

06:45.667 --> 06:48.234
"unless you know why a child
on a merry-go-round

06:48.301 --> 06:50.901
"will wave at his parents
every time around

06:50.967 --> 06:53.967
and why his parents
will always wave back."

06:54.234 --> 06:57.434
So why would a sexual sadist
make women carry his children?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.600
Gary Heidnik kept a harem
in a dungeon.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.267
His goal was to create
a large family

07:01.334 --> 07:03.234
as a replacement for
his own broken home.

07:03.301 --> 07:05.667
Josef Fritzl kept his daughter
in a cell in his own house,

07:05.734 --> 07:07.067
and they had several kids
together.

07:07.634 --> 07:09.000
Squalid conditions
are part

07:09.067 --> 07:11.034
of a control fantasy
these men had.

07:11.100 --> 07:13.167
If he's keeping these women
in a similar location,

07:13.234 --> 07:15.034
he'd need
a lot of privacy.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.634
He probably
built it himself.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.167
Makes him good with his hands.

07:18.234 --> 07:20.167
Why blondes, and what
significance do they have to him?

07:20.234 --> 07:22.368
Maybe, uh, the woman
who rejected him

07:22.433 --> 07:24.800
or the woman who wouldn't
bear his children?

07:24.867 --> 07:27.268
If that were true, he'd be
the same age as these girls--

07:27.334 --> 07:28.333
Late teens.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.034
This unsub is too skilled
for that.

07:30.101 --> 07:31.368
His own mother, then?

07:31.433 --> 07:34.101
She could be a runaway,
just like these victims.

07:34.167 --> 07:35.667
Which makes his compulsion
Psych 101--

07:35.734 --> 07:38.301
Killing his mother over and over
again for giving birth to him.

07:38.368 --> 07:40.633
Yeah, but then why wait
until after she gives birth?

07:40.700 --> 07:43.234
Now he has a body
and a baby to get rid of.

07:43.301 --> 07:45.967
That troubles me, too. We found
the mothers but not the infants.

07:46.334 --> 07:47.834
Uh, I hate to say this,

07:47.900 --> 07:50.768
but what if the women are
just a means to an end?

07:50.834 --> 07:54.234
What if the babies are really
the ones he's exploiting?

07:54.300 --> 07:55.900
If Kristie Taylor
just surfaced,

07:55.967 --> 07:58.234
it means he has her
baby right now.

07:58.301 --> 07:59.867
JJ, check with the parents.
See if there are any similarities

07:59.934 --> 08:02.301
in the runaways' patterns,
where the unsub's finding them.

08:02.367 --> 08:04.301
Reid and Prentiss,
go to the latest dump site.

08:04.367 --> 08:06.267
We need to look
at victimology.

08:06.334 --> 08:08.967
How he treats these women
in the final moments of their lives

08:09.034 --> 08:10.934
might tell us what he's
doing to the children.

08:11.001 --> 08:12.667
Doctor, you wrote
in your report

08:12.734 --> 08:14.533
that Kristie had had
several miscarriages.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.834
How was that evident?

08:15.901 --> 08:18.167
There were a number of abrasions
in her uterine lining.

08:18.634 --> 08:20.600
Around the third trimester,
her water would break.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.700
So she never
carried to term?

08:22.767 --> 08:24.067
No, last time she did.

08:24.134 --> 08:25.734
There was a high level
of pitocin in her blood.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.601
It's an artificial hormone.
you give it to induce labor.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.401
She was on a tight schedule?

08:31.467 --> 08:33.734
If she lost the baby, he would get
her pregnant again immediately.

08:33.801 --> 08:35.333
Childbirth is tough enough.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.833
Imagine if your life
depends upon it.

08:37.900 --> 08:39.033
All 3 moms had records.

08:39.100 --> 08:40.634
Drug abuse,
drunk and disorderlies.

08:40.701 --> 08:43.201
But what's more interesting
is what he does after he kidnaps them.

08:43.267 --> 08:45.200
This is Kristie Taylor 2 weeks
before she was abducted.

08:47.967 --> 08:49.067
He got her healthy.

08:49.134 --> 08:51.033
Well-fed and off
the habit.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.967
Not completely.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.301
These drugs in Kristie's system--
what are they?

08:56.367 --> 08:58.201
Tamoxifen, Metoclopramide,

08:58.267 --> 08:59.601
Domperidone, Progesterone.

08:59.668 --> 09:02.467
Progesterone's a prenatal
medication, isn't it?

09:02.534 --> 09:05.467
They all are. The first two help
carry the baby to term.

09:05.534 --> 09:07.934
The last two
help with lactation.

09:08.001 --> 09:09.434
What kind of sexual sadist

09:09.500 --> 09:11.167
gives his victims
prenatal drugs?

09:11.434 --> 09:13.634
The kind who takes care
of the kids he's having.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.634
He gets his rocks off
killing the moms,

09:15.700 --> 09:17.034
but the babies he protects.

09:17.100 --> 09:19.234
You think he's keeping them?

09:19.301 --> 09:20.534
If he despises the moms,

09:20.601 --> 09:22.434
he'd despise
their children, too.

09:22.501 --> 09:23.733
New Mexico's
right on the border.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.134
A lot of human
trafficking going on.

09:26.201 --> 09:27.967
This tight schedule
he keeps the moms on--

09:28.034 --> 09:29.301
He could be breeding.

09:29.367 --> 09:31.234
Call child protection
services.

09:31.301 --> 09:34.000
We need to find out about
existing black markets for infants.

09:34.467 --> 09:36.300
Thank you.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.534
There's no tire tracks.

09:39.601 --> 09:41.434
The body wasn't dumped
that far from the road.

09:41.501 --> 09:43.334
This guy doesn't
care about them,

09:43.401 --> 09:44.701
not enough to even
hide them very well.

09:44.768 --> 09:46.367
That's why this doesn't
make any sense.

09:46.434 --> 09:48.701
Dump sites reveal something
about the unsub, you know?

09:48.768 --> 09:50.768
At the very least,
a geographic familiarity,

09:50.834 --> 09:52.868
a place he knows
he won't get caught.

09:52.933 --> 09:54.667
Ok, so he knows this road.

09:54.734 --> 09:58.200
Yeah, except he abducted
Kristie in Farmington

09:58.267 --> 09:59.868
and then dumps her here
in Rio Rancho.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.501
It's a 175-mile drive.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.701
Why drive that far just to
dump a body by the side of the road?

10:03.768 --> 10:06.667
A forensic countermeasure?
Covering his tracks by sheer distance?

10:06.734 --> 10:09.401
So the geographical profile
won't do us much good.

10:09.467 --> 10:11.067
No, it will,

10:11.134 --> 10:12.501
just not
with the victims.

10:12.567 --> 10:14.900
We profiled that it's the babies
that he's interested in.

10:14.967 --> 10:17.100
That's where
he'll reveal himself.

10:17.167 --> 10:19.234
The adoption company
he sells through

10:19.300 --> 10:21.200
and whatever network
of resources he uses.

10:21.267 --> 10:22.933
He makes shortcuts
there for convenience.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.734
No one's gonna drive
100 miles for diapers

10:24.801 --> 10:26.667
or for a public notary
for legal paperwork.

10:26.734 --> 10:28.768
If the babies are in the
system, they'll lead us to him.

10:28.834 --> 10:30.234
Child trafficking

10:30.300 --> 10:31.834
is huge
in other countries,

10:31.900 --> 10:33.734
but here
it's mostly a myth.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.167
Why is that?

10:35.234 --> 10:37.067
There's an easier
and legal path--

10:37.134 --> 10:38.267
Adoption.

10:38.334 --> 10:40.234
There'd be a paper trail,
though, wouldn't there?

10:40.300 --> 10:42.401
There are ways
to hide your tracks.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.967
There must be a way
to identify all these kids.

10:45.033 --> 10:46.601
There's a court record
for every adoption.

10:46.667 --> 10:47.667
Give us the records.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.567
We'll start weeding
them out by date.

10:49.634 --> 10:52.200
The adoptions
in this state are closed.

10:52.267 --> 10:54.367
The files are sealed.
so it'll take time.

10:54.434 --> 10:56.334
That's a luxury
we don't have.

10:56.401 --> 10:58.367
There's a child
at risk right now.

10:58.434 --> 11:01.033
All children who go in
and out of the adoption system

11:01.100 --> 11:04.267
get basic genetic screenings
for pre-existing conditions.

11:04.334 --> 11:05.868
We have their DNA.

11:05.933 --> 11:08.868
We can use that. We
can match the maternal DNA

11:08.933 --> 11:10.300
with the babies
in the system.

11:10.367 --> 11:12.267
We're still talking
hundreds of kids.

11:12.334 --> 11:14.734
What if we give you
one of the babies' DNA?

11:14.801 --> 11:16.900
That would make it
go faster, yeah.

11:16.967 --> 11:19.567
He kills these moms so soon
after they give birth,

11:19.634 --> 11:22.100
secondary DNA could
still be on their bodies.

11:22.167 --> 11:24.067
I'll call the M.E.

11:24.134 --> 11:27.434
I understand.
Thank you, doctor.

11:27.501 --> 11:29.100
Agent Jareau?

11:29.167 --> 11:30.467
I'm Conrad Winmar.

11:30.534 --> 11:31.900
This is my wife Jane.

11:31.967 --> 11:34.967
Thank you
for coming in.

11:37.501 --> 11:40.467
Why don't we talk
privately?

11:46.467 --> 11:50.267
You--you want to
dig up our daughter?

11:50.334 --> 11:53.167
We think the unsub
might have left DNA on her.

11:53.234 --> 11:55.634
The last 2 victims
didn't have any,

11:55.701 --> 11:58.200
but because Monica
was the first,

11:58.267 --> 12:00.467
he might have
made a mistake.

12:00.534 --> 12:02.701
Back when they found her,

12:02.768 --> 12:04.967
the detectives said that
they did not find his DNA.

12:05.033 --> 12:09.134
It's not his DNA
we're looking for.

12:09.200 --> 12:13.000
We suspect your daughter
gave birth while she was captive.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.701
What?

12:14.768 --> 12:19.167
The unsub has gotten all
of his victims pregnant.

12:20.267 --> 12:22.200
He might be
putting the babies

12:22.267 --> 12:24.834
in the adoption system.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.234
The baby's alive?

12:26.300 --> 12:27.734
Possibly.

12:27.801 --> 12:31.434
If we could find placental
tissue on Monica,

12:31.501 --> 12:32.868
we can test the DNA

12:32.933 --> 12:35.534
against the state's records.

12:35.601 --> 12:38.200
Give us the release.

12:38.267 --> 12:39.667
The first time I saw her,

12:39.734 --> 12:42.134
saw her record, too.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.834
Thought she was just
another girl on the street,

12:44.900 --> 12:46.701
not caring what
she did to herself.

12:46.768 --> 12:49.067
I never even thought
to look for this.

12:49.134 --> 12:50.367
What is it?

12:50.434 --> 12:53.234
It's a baby's umbilical cord.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.601
The child should be
about 4 now.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.868
I hope you find him or her.

12:57.933 --> 13:00.401
I really do.

13:00.467 --> 13:02.367
Thank you.
Mm.

13:02.434 --> 13:03.868
Ok, know this--

13:03.933 --> 13:05.701
most adoption folk
are like the nicest,

13:05.768 --> 13:07.534
most dedicated people
in the world.

13:07.601 --> 13:09.401
There are, however,
one or two skeezy ones.

13:09.467 --> 13:10.634
How skeezy?

13:10.701 --> 13:13.134
Super skeezy. I've got
a spread sheet from one of them

13:13.200 --> 13:14.933
expecting compensation
for the baby I'm having.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.067
Something you want
to tell me, Garcia?

13:17.134 --> 13:18.933
Oh, that's the sad part,
my prince.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.933
The genetically perfect
offspring

13:21.000 --> 13:22.434
of Penelope Garcia
and Derek Morgan

13:22.501 --> 13:23.933
wouldn't fetch top dollar.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.033
Who does?

13:25.100 --> 13:26.367
White babies
are in higher demand

13:26.434 --> 13:27.701
than minorities.

13:27.768 --> 13:29.367
Boys are more popular
than girls,

13:29.434 --> 13:30.634
at least this year, anyway.

13:30.701 --> 13:32.967
And then there's
the Swedish supermodel rule.

13:33.033 --> 13:34.534
The what?

13:34.601 --> 13:37.300
If I were to deliver a blond-haired,
blue-eyed bundle of joy,

13:37.367 --> 13:39.134
i'd be set for life.
I would.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.367
Garcia,
did the baby's DNA

13:40.434 --> 13:42.467
turn up in New Mexico's
adoption records?

13:42.534 --> 13:43.900
No. There's no hits
on her profile.

13:43.967 --> 13:45.100
and it is a her,
by the way.

13:45.167 --> 13:47.634
This unsub could still
be selling babies,

13:47.701 --> 13:49.300
just not through the system.

13:49.367 --> 13:50.534
That's gonna make him
a lot harder to catch.

13:50.601 --> 13:52.267
All right. It's late.

13:52.334 --> 13:55.134
Let's get some rest. We'll hit
this fresh in the morning.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.868
Garcia out.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.467
Morgan.

14:01.734 --> 14:04.634
I'd like for you to write up
a preliminary profile.

14:05.834 --> 14:06.967
We don't have enough
for that.

14:07.033 --> 14:08.467
Well, that's why
it's preliminary.

14:08.534 --> 14:11.634
A work in progress profile helps
show us what we're missing.

14:11.701 --> 14:13.100
Ok.

14:13.167 --> 14:15.033
Sure.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.801
How you holding up?

14:21.868 --> 14:23.634
We just wasted a day
looking into a black market

14:23.701 --> 14:25.134
that probably doesn't exist.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.200
That's not what I mean.

14:26.267 --> 14:27.467
I've heard whispers.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.234
You're getting some heat.

14:30.834 --> 14:32.567
I'm taking care of it.

14:35.801 --> 14:39.634
So, you, uh, think we have
a tunnel vision problem?

14:39.701 --> 14:41.134
I think
we'd like to believe

14:41.200 --> 14:42.401
that we could
save those kids,

14:42.467 --> 14:43.900
but look what he does
to the mothers.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.134
A lot of anger.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.401
He's probably doing the same
thing to the children.

14:47.467 --> 14:49.701
His own children.

14:49.768 --> 14:52.801
Maybe.

14:52.868 --> 14:55.367
Garcia said something
interesting.

14:55.434 --> 14:57.501
Blond-haired, blue-eyed
babies get top dollar

14:57.567 --> 15:00.000
in the adoption system.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.667
All the mothers...

15:02.734 --> 15:05.334
Have blond hair
and blue eyes.

15:05.401 --> 15:07.033
You're gonna love this.

15:07.100 --> 15:10.200
This guy,
he has like the best.

15:10.267 --> 15:12.033
Like there is no better.

15:12.100 --> 15:14.134
He has like
this access to God.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.701
He doesn't want
to hang on to it.

15:15.768 --> 15:17.467
He wants to give it away.

15:17.534 --> 15:18.701
How much further?

15:18.768 --> 15:20.167
Not much.

15:20.234 --> 15:22.601
Because that's what God's
love is, you know, it's sharing.

15:22.667 --> 15:25.033
It's giving everything
you have of yourself away

15:25.100 --> 15:27.834
and not expecting
anything in return.

15:27.900 --> 15:28.868
Where are we?

15:28.933 --> 15:30.234
Right here, baby,

15:30.300 --> 15:31.601
Right where
we need to be.

15:33.801 --> 15:35.401
Aah!

15:36.933 --> 15:38.701
Aah! Aah!

15:46.801 --> 15:48.467
She's good, right?

15:48.534 --> 15:50.401
That's the kind
of chick you want?

15:52.167 --> 15:54.067
She's perfect.

15:56.767 --> 15:58.767
I know it's a long shot,
but Monica's parents

15:58.833 --> 16:00.167
said that she was heading west.

16:00.434 --> 16:02.534
Maybe she made it part of
the way when she was kidnapped.

16:02.601 --> 16:05.401
So why not run her DNA against adoption
records in surrounding states?

16:05.467 --> 16:07.967
Are you kidding?
I think you're brilliant.

16:08.233 --> 16:10.834
Hey, JJ, if we find
this little girl,

16:10.901 --> 16:12.334
what's gonna happen to her?

16:12.400 --> 16:13.834
If something illegal
transpires

16:13.901 --> 16:15.934
during the adoption process,
the court nullifies it,

16:16.001 --> 16:18.901
the child gets returned
to the closest blood relative.

16:18.968 --> 16:20.167
Huh.

16:20.233 --> 16:21.701
If it helps,

16:21.767 --> 16:23.667
I have met with
the grandparents.

16:23.734 --> 16:25.100
They're
wonderful people.

16:25.467 --> 16:27.268
Oh, I'm sure they are.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.800
It's just...

16:29.867 --> 16:32.001
I don't know, I...

16:32.067 --> 16:33.433
I lost my parents.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.500
Granted, I was older
than she is, but...

16:36.567 --> 16:40.201
what got me through were
the people closest to me, and...

16:40.268 --> 16:43.667
If Monica's daughter
is with a good family

16:43.734 --> 16:46.567
and we take her away
from them...

16:46.634 --> 16:49.167
Are we doing
more harm than good?

16:49.234 --> 16:50.433
Yeah.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.934
Garcia, I don't think
we have a choice.

16:53.001 --> 16:55.867
These people have a right
to their granddaughter.

16:55.934 --> 16:57.400
You're right.

16:57.467 --> 16:58.433
Yeah.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.101
This sucks.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.334
Yes, right away, please.

17:02.401 --> 17:04.134
Thank you.

17:04.201 --> 17:07.567
Hey. I just called CPS, asked them
to send over infant mortality files.

17:07.633 --> 17:08.733
Another group
for us to eliminate.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.567
Good.
What's that?

17:10.633 --> 17:13.367
Your profile. I disagree
with your analysis.

17:13.634 --> 17:14.667
Hotch, are you serious?

17:14.733 --> 17:16.201
<i>It's not a law review
article,</i>

17:16.267 --> 17:17.767
it's just something
for us to brainstorm.

17:17.833 --> 17:19.201
But you only focused
on one angle, Morgan,

17:19.267 --> 17:21.434
that the prenatal drugs
indicate the presence

17:21.501 --> 17:23.501
of a wife or a girlfriend.
We need more options.

17:23.568 --> 17:26.201
Which I can give you once we
make the proper deductions.

17:26.267 --> 17:28.668
Hotch, you're asking me
to guess.

17:28.733 --> 17:30.767
Morgan, in order for
the profile to be useful,

17:30.833 --> 17:32.267
it has to generate
multiple scenarios

17:32.334 --> 17:33.501
about what the unsub
is doing.

17:33.568 --> 17:34.668
Rewrite it.

17:34.733 --> 17:35.867
We got her.

17:35.934 --> 17:37.100
Monica Winmar's daughter.

17:37.167 --> 17:38.301
She was adopted 4 years ago.

17:38.367 --> 17:39.401
She's Lisa now.

17:39.467 --> 17:40.900
How did Garcia find her?

17:40.967 --> 17:42.401
She cross-referenced
the entire New Mexico system.

17:42.467 --> 17:45.134
She wasn't in New Mexico.
She was in Arizona.

17:45.201 --> 17:47.867
So all the mothers were abducted
and dumped in New Mexico,

17:47.934 --> 17:49.967
but he keeps the babies
in Arizona.

17:50.034 --> 17:52.201
He knows the police with
stop looking at the state line.

17:52.267 --> 17:54.134
The adoption agency's gonna be
our best lead to the unsub.

17:54.201 --> 17:55.301
Who handled the case?

17:55.367 --> 17:56.833
That's bombshell
number 2.

17:56.900 --> 17:58.700
She didn't go through
an agency.

17:58.767 --> 18:00.401
She was dropped off
anonymously at a church.

18:00.467 --> 18:02.234
Hospitals and churches
are safe havens.

18:02.301 --> 18:04.568
You can drop a baby off,
no questions asked.

18:04.634 --> 18:06.234
Child protection services
would look for the closest relative.

18:06.301 --> 18:08.167
Another search that ends
at the state line.

18:08.234 --> 18:11.000
And if CPS doesn't find one,
the baby will go into foster care,

18:11.067 --> 18:12.301
which is what happened
to Lisa.

18:12.367 --> 18:13.833
She was lucky.
The adoption process

18:13.900 --> 18:14.934
happened within a month.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.767
So, this unsub
had the opportunity

18:16.833 --> 18:18.201
to make money off this infant.

18:18.267 --> 18:20.467
He doesn't,
drops it off at a church

18:20.534 --> 18:22.934
because he knows the state
will take good care of it.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.234
That's awfully considerate.

18:24.301 --> 18:26.434
Outside the murders,
nothing about this unsub's

18:26.501 --> 18:28.234
behavior profiles
like a sexual sadist...

18:28.301 --> 18:29.534
As I wrote.

18:29.601 --> 18:30.733
Yeah, Morgan's right.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.100
It's the actions of a caretaker,
a mother.

18:33.167 --> 18:34.934
Could our unsub be a woman?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.534
Uh, only a man would torture
his victims this much.

18:37.601 --> 18:39.467
Men get off on this kind
of violence. Women don't.

18:39.534 --> 18:41.934
He could be married,
though, his wife being

18:42.000 --> 18:43.134
a passive participant,
taking care of the moms.

18:43.201 --> 18:44.301
And the babies.

18:44.367 --> 18:45.767
All right.
We need to split up.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.134
We'll give the profile
to the Arizona

18:47.201 --> 18:48.434
and the New Mexico
state police.

18:48.501 --> 18:50.067
Rossi, Reid, and Prentiss,
I want you to head to Phoenix.

18:50.134 --> 18:53.668
Morgan, you're here with me.
We'll finalize the profile.

18:58.134 --> 18:59.401
Ohh.

18:59.467 --> 19:02.401
How are you feeling?

19:02.467 --> 19:04.367
Terrible.

19:05.301 --> 19:06.833
What are you on?

19:06.900 --> 19:08.234
What?

19:08.301 --> 19:09.668
What are you talking about?

19:09.733 --> 19:12.100
When he takes us,
we're all on something.

19:12.167 --> 19:13.767
I was an alcoholic.

19:13.833 --> 19:15.234
So, what are you on?

19:15.301 --> 19:18.034
Uh...crack.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.800
I'm Carol.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.167
I'm Julie.

19:22.234 --> 19:26.367
Here. Here's some water.
Come drink some.

19:31.668 --> 19:36.434
Um...is this some kind of
tough love detox?

19:38.134 --> 19:40.434
Oh, what is that?

19:40.501 --> 19:42.833
It's like the sun.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.833
It gives us vitamin D.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.767
It keeps us healthy.

19:46.833 --> 19:49.301
Well, they can't make us
stay here.

19:50.668 --> 19:52.967
Hey! Hey, let me out!

19:53.034 --> 19:55.000
I want to go home!

19:55.067 --> 19:58.100
I want my clothes!
I want my phone!

19:58.167 --> 20:01.501
Let me out of here!
Let me out!

20:01.568 --> 20:03.601
Why is he doing this?

20:03.668 --> 20:05.401
What does he want?

20:06.367 --> 20:08.467
Your baby.

20:08.534 --> 20:10.100
I'm not pregnant.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.201
You will be.

20:14.100 --> 20:16.134
The unsubs that we are
looking for are a couple.

20:16.201 --> 20:17.634
Now, the man in the relationship

20:17.700 --> 20:19.601
most likely has a history
of sexual violence.

20:19.668 --> 20:22.334
He started with stalking, and then
moved his way up to assault and rape.

20:22.401 --> 20:24.134
And that violent streak
ended temporarily

20:24.201 --> 20:26.034
when he found his wife.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.501
For the first years
of their marriage,

20:27.568 --> 20:29.000
she submitted to his torture.

20:29.067 --> 20:31.833
Look for wives who came
into the E.R. repeatedly

20:31.900 --> 20:33.800
and with obvious signs
of spousal abuse,

20:33.867 --> 20:35.733
but you are gonna have to
go back about 5 years.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.334
That's because around the time
of the first abduction,

20:38.401 --> 20:39.501
the visits stopped.

20:39.568 --> 20:41.167
The sexual sadist
can't find satisfaction

20:41.234 --> 20:42.401
from a willing participant.

20:42.467 --> 20:44.100
He eventually got to a place
where he couldn't escalate

20:44.167 --> 20:45.700
his violence against her
without killing her,

20:45.767 --> 20:47.167
so she made him a deal.

20:47.234 --> 20:49.067
He gets to kidnap,
rape, and kill

20:49.134 --> 20:50.668
each of the runaways,

20:50.733 --> 20:52.833
and she gets to keep
the children.

20:52.900 --> 20:55.668
She's been giving the victims
a series of prescription prenatal drugs.

20:55.767 --> 20:58.634
So you're gonna want to look
at the obstetric fields, uh,

20:58.700 --> 21:00.000
Nurses, O.B.S.

21:00.067 --> 21:01.467
The wife needs
these children.

21:01.534 --> 21:04.301
At first, they were
the lifeline that kept her alive.

21:04.367 --> 21:07.234
As long as he had other
targets for his abuse,

21:07.301 --> 21:08.800
she avoided his rage.

21:08.867 --> 21:11.134
So if these children
protect her from abuse,

21:11.201 --> 21:13.733
why is she putting them
up for adoption?

21:13.800 --> 21:15.934
We believe the unsubs want
children who resemble them physically,

21:16.000 --> 21:17.634
who no one would question
as their own.

21:17.700 --> 21:19.467
All of the runaways
have been blond,

21:19.534 --> 21:21.467
which means the unsub
may be as well.

21:21.534 --> 21:23.900
But the first child we found
in the system was a brunette.

21:23.967 --> 21:25.634
Whatever the physical
characteristic--

21:25.700 --> 21:28.034
the color of the eyes,
the skin type--

21:28.100 --> 21:29.934
if the baby doesn't have it,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.334
he or she ends up
in the foster care system.

21:32.401 --> 21:34.867
Wives of sexual sadists
need outlets

21:34.934 --> 21:37.601
as a denial mechanism to cope
with what their partners are doing.

21:37.668 --> 21:40.434
And motherhood, especially
taking care of a helpless infant,

21:40.501 --> 21:42.733
is this woman's
way of coping.

21:45.367 --> 21:46.501
You found her?

21:46.568 --> 21:48.534
We have.

21:48.601 --> 21:49.467
How is she?

21:49.534 --> 21:50.934
She's great.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.501
She was adopted
by a young couple.

21:52.568 --> 21:55.301
No reports of physical
or emotional trauma.

21:55.367 --> 21:56.634
So when can we take her?

21:56.700 --> 21:59.601
Right now we're in touch with
her adoptive parents' lawyer,

21:59.668 --> 22:02.134
But the law is on your side.

22:02.201 --> 22:03.700
Can we talk
to the parents?

22:03.767 --> 22:05.434
We could discuss this
with them.

22:05.501 --> 22:07.568
They don't want
to initiate contact.

22:07.634 --> 22:10.800
They've been through
a lot right now.

22:10.867 --> 22:12.467
They're her parents.

22:12.534 --> 22:15.201
Of course they don't
want to give her up.

22:15.267 --> 22:19.467
Well, if she wants to see them,
then we can work that out,

22:19.534 --> 22:20.668
but we are her family.

22:20.733 --> 22:22.134
Yes, absolutely.

22:22.201 --> 22:24.134
No, wait.

22:24.201 --> 22:26.634
What are the risks here?

22:26.700 --> 22:29.700
If we claim her,
are we hurting her?

22:29.767 --> 22:31.167
It's impossible to tell.

22:31.234 --> 22:33.134
Some kids do great.

22:33.201 --> 22:34.900
Others have trouble.

22:34.967 --> 22:36.334
But why are we
talking about risks?

22:36.401 --> 22:37.700
She's Monica's daughter.

22:37.767 --> 22:38.668
Conrad...

22:38.733 --> 22:40.000
She's not their blood.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.501
Stop it.

22:43.733 --> 22:46.367
Thank you, agent Jareau.

22:46.434 --> 22:49.934
But my husband and I,
we need to discuss this.

23:00.067 --> 23:01.534
What's this?

23:01.601 --> 23:03.267
It's the pattern
I've been looking for.

23:03.334 --> 23:05.434
The unsubs hid their
tracks with the mothers,

23:05.501 --> 23:08.201
but they weren't so careful
with the abandoned babies.

23:08.267 --> 23:09.634
Did you find
more children?

23:09.700 --> 23:11.634
DNA-wise, no,
but deductively, yes.

23:11.700 --> 23:14.067
I gathered all the records
for all infants who entered into foster care

23:14.134 --> 23:16.634
in a 2-week window
following each mother's death.

23:16.700 --> 23:19.467
Then I narrowed it down to babies
that were abandoned at churches.

23:19.534 --> 23:21.201
This is where
the guesswork begins.

23:21.267 --> 23:24.034
Monica Winmar's daughter was
abandoned at a Presbyterian church.

23:24.100 --> 23:27.301
Let's assume the unsub,
or the wife at least, is Presbyterian.

23:27.367 --> 23:28.634
That means all other
unwanted children

23:28.700 --> 23:30.601
are gonna be left at
the same denomination, right?

23:30.668 --> 23:33.301
That narrows it down
to 3 babies

23:33.367 --> 23:35.967
left at 3 different
Presbyterian churches

23:36.034 --> 23:38.267
all within this 20-mile radius.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.967
This is where they live.

23:41.034 --> 23:43.733
These kids
you deduced to--

23:43.800 --> 23:46.100
Have you looked
at their files?

23:46.167 --> 23:48.100
No. Right now I've only
been tracking churches. Why?

23:48.167 --> 23:50.100
Because you just uncovered
another pattern.

23:50.167 --> 23:51.267
Yeah,
We're packing up now.

23:51.334 --> 23:53.134
We can be in Phoenix
in about 2 hours.

23:53.201 --> 23:54.434
You sure about this?

23:54.501 --> 23:56.767
The names of the babies
Reid found tells us everything.

23:56.833 --> 23:59.167
Lisa, Elizabeth, Amanda.

23:59.234 --> 24:00.767
We profiled there'd
be a type they'd keep

24:00.833 --> 24:02.267
and a type they'd put
into foster care.

24:02.334 --> 24:04.067
They're keeping the boys.

24:19.568 --> 24:21.201
It's time.

24:26.967 --> 24:28.533
What are you doing?

24:28.600 --> 24:29.901
What are you doing?!

24:29.967 --> 24:32.234
Hey, where are you going?
Come back!

24:32.301 --> 24:35.734
You have to come back!
Please!

24:35.800 --> 24:37.834
They never stay
for this part.

24:37.901 --> 24:39.867
No, no, no, no.
You're not actually--

24:39.934 --> 24:43.634
Yes...I am.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.134
They've induced.

24:45.201 --> 24:47.433
What am I supposed to do?

24:47.500 --> 24:50.067
You help me.

24:50.134 --> 24:51.533
1-1,000...

24:51.600 --> 24:52.967
Ohh!

24:53.034 --> 24:53.834
2-1,000...

24:53.901 --> 24:55.400
No, no, no, I'm sorry,
I can't.

24:55.467 --> 24:56.667
3-1,000...
I can't help you.

24:56.734 --> 24:58.067
I can't. I'm sick.

24:58.134 --> 25:00.467
I'm not well.
I need a...

25:00.533 --> 25:02.334
I can't do it.
Julie, listen to me.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.800
Are you listening to me?

25:03.867 --> 25:05.201
Yes. Yes.

25:05.268 --> 25:08.201
If this baby
doesn't make it...

25:08.268 --> 25:09.734
They are going
to kill me.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.268
And once they've
killed me,

25:12.334 --> 25:15.001
they are going
to move on to you.

25:15.067 --> 25:17.368
Do you understand?

25:17.433 --> 25:18.667
Ok.

25:18.734 --> 25:21.634
Ok. What do we do?

25:21.700 --> 25:24.867
JJ, I need you to call
these fertility specialists

25:24.934 --> 25:27.134
and get them over here
for interviews.

25:27.201 --> 25:28.800
Whoa.
Yeah, I know.

25:28.867 --> 25:30.368
Hotch wants to focus
on the prenatal drugs

25:30.433 --> 25:32.101
the unsubs are giving
the victims.

25:32.167 --> 25:33.734
He thinks we can build
a new suspect pool,

25:33.800 --> 25:35.201
and he wants it done
yesterday.

25:35.268 --> 25:37.767
There's 2 pages of names here.
Shouldn't we narrow it down?

25:37.834 --> 25:39.467
JJ, just do it, ok?

25:42.067 --> 25:43.533
I'm sorry.

25:46.268 --> 25:48.767
Is everything ok?

25:51.234 --> 25:52.567
Hotch has been on me
ever since we got here,

25:52.634 --> 25:54.268
and for the life of me,
I can't figure out why.

25:54.334 --> 25:56.634
Oh, I might know.

25:56.700 --> 25:58.201
The night before
Hotch picked this case,

25:58.268 --> 26:00.533
chief Strauss
stopped by the B.A.U.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.867
They were behind
closed doors,

26:02.934 --> 26:05.734
and it seemed like
it got a little tense.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.067
Well, the bureau's
been on him for a while.

26:08.134 --> 26:09.767
He must have known
this was gonna happen.

26:09.834 --> 26:13.634
Except now they're making him
justify every decision.

26:13.700 --> 26:16.101
For Hotch, that's...hell.

26:16.167 --> 26:18.600
Dr. Dekeyser,
we don't think

26:18.667 --> 26:20.433
she's getting these prenatal
drugs as a patient.

26:20.500 --> 26:23.034
You're thinking she's writing
the scrip for these herself.

26:23.101 --> 26:24.134
Something like that.

26:24.201 --> 26:26.134
Then she wouldn't be
very knowledgeable

26:26.201 --> 26:27.400
about what she's doing.

26:27.467 --> 26:29.067
Some of these drugs
have serious side effects.

26:29.134 --> 26:31.533
There's dozens of meds
I would prescribe before these,

26:31.600 --> 26:32.700
all of them more effective.

26:32.767 --> 26:34.234
So why would she use these?

26:34.301 --> 26:36.734
My guess--these are the ones
she had access to.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.234
Fertility drugs
are a cocktail,

26:38.301 --> 26:41.067
and you keep remixing the
cocktail until you get pregnant.

26:41.134 --> 26:43.234
The information is out there
on the internet.

26:43.301 --> 26:44.834
She found the right one.

26:44.901 --> 26:47.234
So the woman was
prescribed these drugs

26:47.301 --> 26:48.834
maybe for
some other illness

26:48.901 --> 26:51.700
and figured out that
they helped carry a baby to term.

26:51.767 --> 26:53.001
Exactly.

26:53.067 --> 26:54.201
Then the real question is,

26:54.268 --> 26:57.901
what other diseases
do these drugs treat?

26:57.967 --> 27:00.901
Ok. I can do this.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.234
I can do this.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.034
What?

27:07.101 --> 27:11.301
Nothing.
You remind me of me.

27:13.301 --> 27:15.234
Carol? Hey.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.700
Carol, please,
Please stay awake.

27:17.767 --> 27:19.034
Please?

27:19.101 --> 27:20.567
Ok, just--just focus

27:20.634 --> 27:22.201
On the sound of my voice, ok?

27:22.268 --> 27:23.134
Can you do that?

27:23.201 --> 27:24.433
I'm here.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.800
Carol, tell me
about the woman

27:26.867 --> 27:28.700
who was here before me.

27:28.767 --> 27:30.734
What happened to her?

27:30.800 --> 27:33.368
She miscarried...

27:33.433 --> 27:35.368
A lot.

27:35.433 --> 27:38.268
Then she gave birth
to a girl.

27:38.334 --> 27:40.967
They don't like girls.

27:41.034 --> 27:44.368
This isn't your
first time, is it?

27:44.433 --> 27:47.001
No.

27:47.067 --> 27:49.001
What happened?

27:50.500 --> 27:52.901
He didn't make it.

27:54.467 --> 27:57.301
I'm sorry.

27:57.368 --> 28:01.001
They let you live
even if you lose him.

28:03.067 --> 28:05.600
They want those boys.

28:05.667 --> 28:08.734
Ok. Ok, hey. Hey.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.934
Listen, I don't know
what to do, ok,

28:11.001 --> 28:14.500
so please, please,
just tell me what to do.

28:16.067 --> 28:17.567
How dilated am I?

28:17.634 --> 28:20.368
Wh-what? I don't know
what that means.

28:20.433 --> 28:24.201
Just put your fingers
in a row and...

28:24.268 --> 28:26.634
Measure me.

28:26.700 --> 28:28.700
Wait...

28:28.767 --> 28:31.001
Oh, my god.

28:34.533 --> 28:36.467
Ok...

28:36.533 --> 28:37.800
Oh, my god.

28:37.867 --> 28:40.001
Ok. Um...

28:40.067 --> 28:42.700
It's 4. It's 4 fingers.

28:42.767 --> 28:44.533
And I--oh, god,
is that the head?

28:44.600 --> 28:45.600
Mm-hmm.

28:45.667 --> 28:48.433
Oh, my god,
What does that mean?

28:50.867 --> 28:52.001
It means...

28:52.067 --> 28:54.767
It's time to push.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.567
What is this?

29:00.634 --> 29:01.767
It's a tactical
arrest plan.

29:01.834 --> 29:03.500
I'd like you to write
it up for this case.

29:03.567 --> 29:05.334
You want me to write up
how we apprehend these unsubs

29:05.400 --> 29:07.334
without risking the lives
of the children.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.268
Yes.

29:09.334 --> 29:11.433
Hotch, I've led
dozens of tactical assaults.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.567
You've never made me
write up one of these before.

29:13.634 --> 29:16.167
That's because I always
do it for you after each case.

29:17.734 --> 29:19.101
You know what?

29:19.167 --> 29:21.533
I'm sorry Strauss
is coming down on you.

29:21.600 --> 29:22.834
This is not about Strauss.

29:22.901 --> 29:25.234
Really? I disagree.

29:25.301 --> 29:27.134
Look, I understand
that you're under the gun.

29:27.201 --> 29:29.934
But I gotta say it. I'm really not
all that surprised.

29:30.001 --> 29:33.700
I've watched you walk away from a
bunch of cops gunning down unsubs in D.C.

29:33.767 --> 29:36.967
You walked in unprotected to a
hostage situation in Louisville.

29:37.034 --> 29:39.101
Of course the bureau's
worried about you.

29:39.167 --> 29:40.901
Man, I'm worried about you.

29:40.967 --> 29:43.567
But just because you're the one who's
under the magnifying glass,

29:43.634 --> 29:45.201
that doesn't mean
I can't do my job.

29:45.268 --> 29:48.500
Morgan, there's a big part
of your job that I do for you

29:48.567 --> 29:50.700
because I don't need you worried
about paperwork and politics.

29:50.767 --> 29:52.967
I need you in the field and focused
and catching the next unsub.

29:53.034 --> 29:54.800
But I can't do that anymore.

29:54.867 --> 29:56.700
I don't have to justify
my orders to you,

29:56.767 --> 29:58.634
and you do have to
follow them.

29:58.700 --> 30:01.567
I've always followed your orders
when they made sense.

30:01.634 --> 30:05.134
Well, if you have a problem
with this one, tell me now.

30:05.201 --> 30:07.334
You're the boss.

30:08.967 --> 30:10.800
Garcia needs to talk
to us ASAP.

30:10.867 --> 30:13.234
Ok, so the gold star of the
day goes to agent David Rossi

30:13.301 --> 30:15.067
and his short list
of one disease

30:15.134 --> 30:16.967
These prenatal drugs
also treat.

30:17.034 --> 30:19.800
Breast Cancer. Progesterone,
Tamoxifen slow the spread,

30:19.867 --> 30:20.967
Metoclopramide
and Domperidone--

30:21.034 --> 30:23.700
are for anti-nausea
if I remember correctly.

30:23.767 --> 30:26.334
If this woman has breast cancer,
would she be able to get pregnant?

30:26.400 --> 30:28.433
She could.
She'd have to be dedicated.

30:28.500 --> 30:29.500
How dedicated?

30:29.567 --> 30:31.001
Well, she'd have to
go off chemotherapy.

30:31.067 --> 30:32.167
She'd be in a lot of pain.

30:32.234 --> 30:33.500
But she'll try anyway.

30:33.567 --> 30:35.433
Her whole life is children.
That's her goal.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.201
The first runaway,
Monica Winmar,

30:37.268 --> 30:38.400
When was she abducted?

30:38.467 --> 30:39.467
5 years ago.

30:39.533 --> 30:40.967
How many breast cancer
patients in Arizona

30:41.034 --> 30:42.834
got pregnant
5 to 6 years ago?

30:42.901 --> 30:44.500
Uh, let me see.

30:44.567 --> 30:45.934
Not a lot. 7.

30:46.001 --> 30:48.201
How many of those patients
are married to a man

30:48.268 --> 30:50.767
with a history
of sexual violence?

30:50.834 --> 30:52.667
Just one--
Robert and Linda Reimann.

30:52.734 --> 30:54.500
Oh, jeez.
What?

30:54.567 --> 30:55.901
She lost the baby
in month 8.

30:55.967 --> 30:57.700
She had to go through
labor anyway.

30:57.767 --> 30:59.834
Well, that kind of physical and
emotional trauma, there's our stressor.

30:59.901 --> 31:01.700
Garcia,
was the baby a boy?

31:01.767 --> 31:04.800
Yeah. They even
named him--Michael.

31:04.867 --> 31:06.500
There has to be a name
on the death certificate.

31:06.567 --> 31:09.934
Doctors encourage bonding
between mothers and stillborns.

31:10.001 --> 31:12.567
I...volunteer with
a new mom counseling group.

31:12.634 --> 31:14.167
They say it helps them
cope with feelings of loss.

31:14.234 --> 31:17.967
Well, this unsub can't cope,
so she's recreating them.

31:18.034 --> 31:20.967
Ok, come on, you're
almost there. Just push.

31:21.034 --> 31:22.067
Push!

31:24.433 --> 31:27.034
Oh, my god.

31:27.967 --> 31:29.934
Is it a boy or a girl?

31:30.001 --> 31:31.767
Ha! It's a boy.

31:33.334 --> 31:36.433
Oh...

31:40.567 --> 31:43.268
You're here.

31:43.334 --> 31:45.600
You made it.

31:54.767 --> 31:56.201
No.

31:58.368 --> 32:00.034
Don't.

32:00.101 --> 32:02.800
No! No, please, leave
her alone. Please!

32:02.867 --> 32:05.368
Please, please, please,
Just wait one minute.

32:05.433 --> 32:07.201
Please, please!

32:16.567 --> 32:18.567
It's a boy.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.500
Michael.

32:32.001 --> 32:34.001
Ok, commander, this here

32:34.067 --> 32:35.567
is the unsub's address.

32:35.634 --> 32:37.400
Now, 5 years ago
when the wife lost their child,

32:37.467 --> 32:38.867
the husband started paying

32:38.934 --> 32:40.767
for home renovations
with his credit card.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.901
Shower, toilet, tile,
and mesh fencing

32:42.967 --> 32:44.334
which he did not put up
in his backyard.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.400
He was building
his dungeon.

32:46.467 --> 32:48.368
No permits were filed for additional
building on the property,

32:48.433 --> 32:50.001
so the entrance
must be inside the house.

32:50.067 --> 32:51.467
How many doors
are there to cover?

32:51.533 --> 32:53.567
There's 2--one in the front,
one in the back.

32:53.634 --> 32:55.201
We have the arrest warrants?

32:55.268 --> 32:56.134
Faxed over
20 minutes ago.

32:56.201 --> 32:57.368
Morgan, what's your plan?

32:57.433 --> 32:59.901
I think we should do
a soft entry.

32:59.967 --> 33:01.001
See if we can get
the kids out

33:01.067 --> 33:02.467
before the parents
even know what's happening.

33:02.533 --> 33:03.867
You'd be in the door first?

33:03.934 --> 33:06.368
Do you have another idea?

33:06.433 --> 33:08.600
Send Prentiss and JJ
in first.

33:08.667 --> 33:11.634
Children are more likely to trust
a woman, and we need that presence.

33:11.700 --> 33:14.101
We don't know how many kids
are in the house.

33:14.167 --> 33:16.101
I mean, the parents
could take a hostage.

33:16.167 --> 33:17.400
But if we go in hot,

33:17.467 --> 33:19.700
that would
definitely happen.

33:19.767 --> 33:21.034
Hotch is right.

33:21.101 --> 33:22.667
This is the way.

34:25.934 --> 34:26.934
Hi.

34:27.001 --> 34:28.600
It's ok.

34:28.667 --> 34:29.934
It's ok.
We're the police.

34:30.001 --> 34:31.533
We're the good guys.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.533
Can you come outside
with me?

34:33.600 --> 34:36.134
Ok. Ok.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.167
Hotch, we've got one boy
accounted for.

34:41.234 --> 34:42.533
He's on his way out
to you,

34:42.600 --> 34:44.533
but there could still
be more in the basement.

35:01.234 --> 35:02.400
FBI.

35:02.467 --> 35:04.700
Where's your wife?

35:04.767 --> 35:06.967
In the nursery.

35:07.034 --> 35:08.767
Rossi.

35:11.433 --> 35:12.533
Hotch.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.101
Go.

35:23.934 --> 35:27.334
I knew this would end.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.767
I always knew
you'd come to our door

35:29.834 --> 35:31.667
and take this away.

35:38.334 --> 35:41.467
Ma'am, why don't you
give me the baby.

35:41.533 --> 35:43.600
We can talk about it.

35:43.667 --> 35:46.268
Why would I want
to do that?

35:48.001 --> 35:50.034
What you've been doing
is wrong.

35:50.101 --> 35:52.067
You must know that.

35:57.334 --> 35:59.634
Oh, god, please, please
get us out of here!

35:59.700 --> 36:03.600
Oh! Oh, thank god.
Thank god.

36:05.134 --> 36:07.368
We're all clear here.

36:07.433 --> 36:08.934
Ohh!

36:09.001 --> 36:11.600
It's ok. It's ok, you're safe.
Come with me.

36:11.667 --> 36:13.334
But no, I can't leave her.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.467
All secure,
but we need medical.

36:15.533 --> 36:18.034
This is all I have left.

36:18.101 --> 36:20.400
Do you understand?

36:20.467 --> 36:22.901
My husband hates me.

36:22.967 --> 36:26.234
There's nobody here
that can help me with him,

36:26.301 --> 36:29.134
with this,
with any of it.

36:29.201 --> 36:31.268
He's all I have.

36:37.034 --> 36:38.934
Linda.

36:39.001 --> 36:40.700
Please.

36:40.767 --> 36:43.734
I need you to think about
the baby right now.

36:45.001 --> 36:48.667
You're suffering from
stage 4 breast cancer.

36:48.734 --> 36:50.334
You've given your medication
to the women

36:50.400 --> 36:53.067
that have been locked up
downstairs.

36:53.134 --> 36:56.167
You don't have
a lot of time left.

36:56.234 --> 37:00.500
I know you want somebody who will
always remember you, don't you?

37:00.567 --> 37:04.034
The baby's name
is Michael, right?

37:04.101 --> 37:06.301
Yeah.

37:06.368 --> 37:09.234
Michael will remember you.

37:09.301 --> 37:11.934
He's gonna know that
you helped bring him into the world.

37:12.001 --> 37:13.800
That's a part of him now.

37:13.867 --> 37:15.433
and he will always
ask about you,

37:15.500 --> 37:17.867
long after you're gone.

37:17.934 --> 37:19.967
Do you really
believe that?

37:20.034 --> 37:21.867
I do.

37:25.467 --> 37:28.901
I would have been
a wonderful mother.

37:30.567 --> 37:32.867
Then prove it.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.834
Let him go.

37:56.234 --> 37:57.667
Where's my son?

37:57.734 --> 37:58.967
We're looking for him.

37:59.034 --> 38:01.500
Please, don't let
anything happen to him.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.901
Look, he's here.

38:03.967 --> 38:05.567
He's fine.

38:12.301 --> 38:13.767
He's ok.

38:17.634 --> 38:19.667
Ohh...

38:19.734 --> 38:23.167
You are beautiful,
aren't you?

38:23.234 --> 38:26.901
* it took 40 days
and 40 nights *

38:26.967 --> 38:30.800
* to get myself
feeling right... *

38:30.867 --> 38:33.767
I spoke with Lisa's
adoptive parents.

38:33.834 --> 38:35.467
They've agreed
to talk to you.

38:35.533 --> 38:37.368
They're not willing
to give up custody,

38:37.433 --> 38:41.201
but they do want Lisa to know
her grandparents.

38:41.268 --> 38:43.500
Yeah, we--
we can live with that.

38:43.567 --> 38:47.301
The reason why
I wanted you to come by

38:47.368 --> 38:50.934
was...a year before
giving birth to Lisa,

38:51.001 --> 38:52.700
Monica had a son.

38:52.767 --> 38:55.901
We've already matched
his DNA to your daughter.

38:55.967 --> 38:59.201
The closest relative
should take custody.

39:00.634 --> 39:03.901
Would you like
to meet him?

39:05.867 --> 39:10.234
* there are no words
to describe... *

39:10.301 --> 39:12.001
What's his name?

39:12.067 --> 39:13.734
Michael.

39:15.400 --> 39:16.867
Michael.

39:32.067 --> 39:38.101
* no, there are no words
to describe *

39:40.600 --> 39:44.667
* such a beautiful thing *

39:52.467 --> 39:55.201
Have a seat.

40:06.067 --> 40:07.834
The bureau thinks
that my ability

40:07.901 --> 40:10.400
to lead this team
has been compromised.

40:10.467 --> 40:12.268
What do you think?

40:14.301 --> 40:16.334
Sometimes I question you,
Hotch.

40:16.400 --> 40:20.167
But at the end of the day,
I do respect you.

40:20.234 --> 40:21.734
You're the leader
of this team,

40:21.800 --> 40:24.567
and my job
is to have your back.

40:24.634 --> 40:27.400
Well, that's not important
to the bureau.

40:27.467 --> 40:30.600
They've been questioning me
since Foyet's attack.

40:30.667 --> 40:32.334
And they're not
entirely wrong.

40:32.400 --> 40:33.800
I've tried to do my best,

40:33.867 --> 40:37.400
but what matters now
is if Strauss replaces me,

40:37.467 --> 40:39.834
this whole unit
will come under scrutiny.

40:39.901 --> 40:41.433
Members will be reassigned,
budgets will be cut.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.334
Come on, Hotch,
nobody's gonna replace you.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.034
Fight Strauss.
I'll go to the mat for you.

40:45.101 --> 40:46.268
So will everybody else.
You know that.

40:46.334 --> 40:47.767
Morgan, it won't work.

40:47.834 --> 40:50.034
Decisions like this have
their own momentum...

40:50.101 --> 40:51.500
Unless I step down.

40:51.567 --> 40:54.034
Step down?
What are you talking about?

40:54.101 --> 40:56.700
I'm resigning as unit chief
at the end of the week.

40:56.767 --> 40:58.600
What?

40:58.667 --> 41:00.201
No!

41:00.268 --> 41:01.700
Hotch, look, yeah, ok,

41:01.767 --> 41:03.467
sometimes your actions,
I may disagree with them,

41:03.533 --> 41:05.634
but it's not enough
for you to leave this team.

41:05.700 --> 41:06.967
I'm not leaving
the team,

41:07.034 --> 41:09.368
I'm just no longer
in charge.

41:09.433 --> 41:11.567
You are.

41:12.467 --> 41:14.301
Me?

41:14.368 --> 41:16.901
Look, I had the chance
to be unit chief in New York,

41:16.967 --> 41:18.234
and I said no.

41:18.301 --> 41:20.334
I turned it down
because I like this team.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.901
Strauss can't just
fire you like this.

41:22.967 --> 41:24.700
She can reassign me.

41:24.767 --> 41:28.334
And we can avoid that
if I promote internally.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.334
This is wrong.

41:30.400 --> 41:33.101
It's the only way
to keep the team together.

41:35.567 --> 41:39.334
So all of this--

41:39.400 --> 41:41.667
This is why you've been
pushing me so hard, huh?

41:41.734 --> 41:43.467
I haven't been
pushing you that hard.

41:44.467 --> 41:46.167
Wow.

41:46.234 --> 41:49.201
Morgan, I need to know

41:49.268 --> 41:51.134
Right now--

41:51.201 --> 41:52.834
Will you do this?

41:56.101 --> 41:57.467
This would be temporary.

41:57.533 --> 41:59.901
Once we catch Foyet,

41:59.967 --> 42:02.533
all this goes back
to normal.

42:02.600 --> 42:04.634
Let's get started.

42:12.433 --> 42:13.967
What's all this?

42:14.034 --> 42:16.201
This is the job,

42:16.268 --> 42:19.400
unless you have
other plans.

42:20.600 --> 42:23.034
Not tonight.
