00:46.700 --> 00:50.027
I guess you've completely given
up on trying to be cool, huh?

00:50.062 --> 00:53.205
Yeah, pretty much.
Wow, this place is amazing.

00:53.240 --> 00:55.874
Look at these buildings.
Look, look at that one.

00:55.909 --> 00:57.223
How did they build that?

00:57.258 --> 01:01.826
Actually, they built that one from the top
down. - Really? Wow. Wow.

01:01.861 --> 01:05.871
Better stick with me. This town's going
to eat you alive. - Taxi!

01:07.586 --> 01:09.175
-Where'd he go?
-Who?

01:09.210 --> 01:11.970
The, the man, the other man.
The man in the front seat.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.957
-The nut?
-Yeah, the nut. Where'd he go?

01:13.992 --> 01:16.265
What was he complaining about?
My taxi is very clean.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.411
Why was he wiping, wiping,
wiping everything?

01:18.446 --> 01:21.428
Look, sir, your taxi is perfect,
but where did he go?

01:21.463 --> 01:23.434
Look, I don't care.
I'll never pick him up again.

01:23.469 --> 01:25.068
You tell him that.
I see him,

01:25.103 --> 01:27.404
I'll keep driving.
I don't care if I lose my license.

01:27.439 --> 01:29.928
Hey, I'll keep driving.

01:31.638 --> 01:33.494
I lost him.

01:33.529 --> 01:35.204
What do you mean?
He was, he was right here.

01:35.239 --> 01:38.918
How could he get lost?
We're 15 feet from the hotel.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.535
Monk!

01:42.039 --> 01:44.394
Oh, my god! Adrian!

01:44.429 --> 01:46.815
Adrian!

01:46.840 --> 01:48.983
Adrian, you can't just
walk away like that.

01:49.018 --> 01:51.514
You scared me half to death.

01:51.549 --> 01:55.135
Somebody dropped this.

01:55.170 --> 01:56.217
You're going to have
to forget about that.

01:56.252 --> 01:58.187
There is no way
that you're going to be able

01:58.222 --> 02:00.261
to clean up New york city
by yourself.

02:00.296 --> 02:01.627
Trust me.

02:01.662 --> 02:04.880
New york city wins.
It's always going to win.

02:04.915 --> 02:06.972
It's so noisy.

02:07.007 --> 02:11.610
-So is San Francisco.
-No, this, this is different.

02:11.645 --> 02:16.029
I can't do this.
I can't really function here.

02:16.064 --> 02:18.830
It's, this is too much, too much.

02:18.865 --> 02:21.768
Adrian, listen to me.

02:21.803 --> 02:24.101
Don't forget why you're
here, all right?

02:24.136 --> 02:26.538
You have a lead, a name.

02:26.573 --> 02:28.967
Finally, after all
these years, you know?

02:29.002 --> 02:32.171
-Warrick Tennyson.
-That's right, Warrick Tennyson.

02:32.206 --> 02:36.341
And he is connected somehow
to Trudy's murder.

02:37.803 --> 02:42.430
- But why does he have to live here?
- I don't know.

02:42.465 --> 02:46.186
When you find him, that can be
the first thing you ask him.

02:46.221 --> 02:49.431
It won't be the first thing I ask him.

02:49.466 --> 02:51.063
Check it out.

02:52.079 --> 02:54.327
-Wow.
-Wow.

02:54.362 --> 02:57.962
Ha ha.
I could get used to this place.

02:57.997 --> 03:01.488
- Do you think they have cable?
- Of course they have cable.

03:01.523 --> 03:05.468
- Can we afford this?
- Well, we didn't have a choice.

03:05.503 --> 03:07.067
Adrian booked the reservation.

03:07.102 --> 03:09.045
It's rated the cleanest
hotel in New York.

03:09.080 --> 03:13.452
Hello, I'm Adrian Monk.
Party of four.

03:13.487 --> 03:15.420
Not much of a party, really.

03:15.455 --> 03:19.597
Here we are, Monk.
You have three rooms.

03:19.632 --> 03:20.955
Oh, three rooms.

03:20.990 --> 03:23.025
-Well, me and Sharona.
-Wait, wait.

03:23.060 --> 03:25.482
I, I thought I was
getting my own room.

03:25.517 --> 03:27.334
Look, well, I'd rather
not be by myself.

03:27.369 --> 03:28.555
Me and the captain.

03:28.590 --> 03:31.606
No. No, no. Sharing
the cab was bad enough.

03:31.641 --> 03:33.145
Well, why don't we
just get a fourth room?

03:33.180 --> 03:35.109
Sorry, we're completely booked.

03:35.144 --> 03:40.211
- Well, uh, how about me and Sharona?
- In your dreams.

03:40.246 --> 03:44.037
Mr. Ambassador, welcome back.
This came for you. - Thank you.

03:44.072 --> 03:47.152
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

03:47.187 --> 03:49.779
Okay, well, uh, whoever gets me,

03:49.814 --> 03:51.536
I, I just have to let you know

03:51.571 --> 03:54.079
I'm going to need the bathroom
all to myself, so...

03:54.114 --> 03:56.340
Um, Adrian, Adrian, um...

03:56.375 --> 03:58.421
do you mind if you just guard
the luggage over there? - Hmm?

03:58.456 --> 04:02.456
Just guard the luggage and
I think they're uneven.

04:02.491 --> 04:06.497
- Oh. Totally uneven.
- Thank you. Good day.

04:06.532 --> 04:09.736
- That's the new Latvian ambassador.
- Whoop-de-doo.

04:09.771 --> 04:12.109
Sis nav mans metelis.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.575
- Get down!
- Police officers!

04:26.610 --> 04:28.868
Everyone down! Down!
Down! Get down!

04:28.903 --> 04:31.096
Call 911 now.

04:36.709 --> 04:40.132
Everybody stay down!
Stay calm! Stay down!

04:40.167 --> 04:42.906
Monk! Monk!

04:42.941 --> 04:44.426
-Are you all right?
-Mm.

04:44.461 --> 04:46.195
-Did you see him?
-Yeah.

04:46.230 --> 04:49.606
Can you identify him?

04:52.100 --> 04:54.552
MONK Season 3x01
Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan

04:54.587 --> 04:56.837
"It's a jungle out there"

04:56.872 --> 05:01.134
"Disorder and confusion
everywhere"

05:01.169 --> 05:05.363
"No one seems to care
Well, I do, hey"

05:05.398 --> 05:07.902
"Who's in charge here"

05:07.937 --> 05:11.287
"It's a jungle out there"

05:11.322 --> 05:14.536
"Poison in the very air we breathe"

05:14.571 --> 05:17.917
"Do you know what's in the water
that you drink, well, I do"

05:17.952 --> 05:21.172
"And it's amazing"

05:21.207 --> 05:24.533
"People think I'm crazy
'cause I worry all the time"

05:24.568 --> 05:27.914
"If you paid attention
you'd be worried too"

05:27.949 --> 05:32.466
"You better pay attention
or this world we love so much"

05:32.501 --> 05:36.300
"Might just kill you"

05:36.335 --> 05:38.531
"I could be wrong now"

05:38.566 --> 05:40.620
"But I don't think so"

05:40.655 --> 05:43.018
"'Cause it's a jungle out there"

05:43.053 --> 05:47.314
"It's a jungle out there"

06:38.439 --> 06:42.424
Is he okay?
Is there a problem here?

06:42.459 --> 06:44.501
He's thinking.

06:50.682 --> 06:53.607
Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk.

06:54.233 --> 06:55.814
We know about your reputation,

06:55.849 --> 07:00.200
and we, uh, we appreciate your help,
but this is a big case.

07:00.235 --> 07:02.110
I've got the Feds
breathing down my neck.

07:02.145 --> 07:04.906
I've got CNN outside.
I don't have all day here.

07:04.941 --> 07:08.525
I can't focus.
It's too noisy.

07:08.560 --> 07:13.746
-What's, what's noisy?
-It's, uh, it's the traffic.

07:14.286 --> 07:18.668
-But we're inside.
-I can hear it.

07:18.703 --> 07:23.309
Would you like us to shut down midtown
Manhattan so you can focus here?

07:23.344 --> 07:25.475
Would that be inconvenient?

07:25.510 --> 07:28.972
Uh, excuse me. Do you mind
if I just talk to him for a sec?

07:32.048 --> 07:33.883
-What's going on?
-Can't you hear that?

07:33.918 --> 07:37.381
-Can't you hear that?
-No.

07:37.416 --> 07:40.117
-It's, it's relentless.
-What?

07:40.152 --> 07:43.360
- The sirens.
- There's no off switch here, okay?

07:43.395 --> 07:47.234
I mean, look, I wish there was,
but there isn't, okay?

07:47.269 --> 07:48.961
The buses...

07:48.996 --> 07:51.682
Monk, come here.
Come here.

07:51.717 --> 07:54.852
Look, these are the people who are
going to help us find Tennyson, okay?

07:54.887 --> 07:56.976
So let's dazzle them here.

07:57.011 --> 07:59.539
That way they'll owe us one.

07:59.574 --> 08:01.119
Remember, we're here for Trudy.

08:01.154 --> 08:03.307
-Right.
-Come on.

08:23.656 --> 08:25.687
-His coat.
-Whose coat?

08:25.722 --> 08:29.314
The ambassador's coat.
It's damp.

08:37.363 --> 08:40.285
He's right.

08:40.321 --> 08:42.231
And the other coats are dry.

08:42.265 --> 08:44.335
How'd we miss that?

08:44.370 --> 08:46.079
You get used to it.

08:46.114 --> 08:50.493
I remember, when the ambassador
came in, he brushed up against me.

08:50.528 --> 08:52.124
His coat was dry.

08:52.159 --> 08:54.545
What, his coat was dry then
but it's wet now?

08:54.580 --> 08:57.815
-Maybe the shooter switched coats.
-Hey.

09:07.311 --> 09:10.479
"Dometri krazluv."
No, it's the right coat.

09:10.514 --> 09:11.999
Now, that's the damnedest thing.

09:12.034 --> 09:14.028
This might not have been political.

09:14.063 --> 09:16.571
He was an ambassador, for god's sake.

09:16.606 --> 09:20.047
His country's on the brink of a civil war.
What else could it be?

09:20.082 --> 09:21.897
But look at how the bodies fell.

09:21.932 --> 09:24.550
The shooter killed
the two bodyguards first.

09:24.585 --> 09:26.892
Well, sure he did,
on account of they were armed.

09:26.927 --> 09:28.950
Nope. No. If this was political,

09:28.985 --> 09:31.709
he would have taken out
his primary target first.

09:31.744 --> 09:33.635
The ambassador.

09:33.670 --> 09:35.802
And he wouldn't have used
a.22 caliber.

09:35.837 --> 09:37.068
It's a pea shooter.

09:37.103 --> 09:39.643
Well, it seemed to do the trick.

09:39.678 --> 09:41.424
The shooter got lucky.

09:41.459 --> 09:43.447
Whatever happened here
wasn't planned.

09:43.482 --> 09:45.343
It, it just happened.

09:45.971 --> 09:47.952
You know, I'm glad
you got a good look at him.

09:47.987 --> 09:49.845
I'm going to need you to
come down to the precinct

09:49.880 --> 09:51.573
and work with my sketch artist.
You know the drill.

09:51.608 --> 09:52.961
You know what? That's
going to have to wait,

09:52.996 --> 09:56.415
because we're meeting somebody
from the D. A's office at 4:00

09:56.450 --> 10:00.041
- about another case, so...
- Your wife's murder.

10:00.076 --> 10:01.558
Yeah, I was sorry to hear.

10:01.593 --> 10:05.053
I just talked to the D. A,
And the meeting's been canceled.

10:05.088 --> 10:05.993
-What?
-Since when?

10:06.028 --> 10:07.950
Well, since 20 minutes ago.

10:07.985 --> 10:11.210
Why? - Well, she didn't say.
She never tells me anything.

10:11.245 --> 10:14.109
Isn't that how it works in Frisco?

10:14.144 --> 10:17.377
First off, the name of our little town
is San Francisco, not Frisco.

10:17.412 --> 10:20.311
Second of all, we just flew
3,000 miles to talk to this guy.

10:20.346 --> 10:22.940
It's the first break
we've had in seven years.

10:22.975 --> 10:24.888
I understand.
I've got people downtown.

10:24.923 --> 10:27.975
I'll make some phone calls.

10:28.010 --> 10:32.234
- We're all on the same team, captain.
- Are we?

10:37.230 --> 10:40.565
Denise, we're talking
about a cop's wife here.

10:41.414 --> 10:42.908
Uh-huh.

10:42.943 --> 10:46.628
All they want to do is talk
to the guy for five minutes.

10:46.663 --> 10:50.262
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I, I see.

10:50.297 --> 10:53.916
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, too.
She won't budge.

10:53.951 --> 10:57.697
-Well, who's her boss?
-The state attorney general.

10:59.886 --> 11:01.924
You're right.
I'm going to call him.

11:01.959 --> 11:04.500
I'm going to call him right now.

11:08.354 --> 11:14.064
Um... let me, uh...let me,
let me clean up, uh, some stuff here.

11:17.116 --> 11:24.008
Um... hmm. The mole...
The mole.

11:24.043 --> 11:25.111
What about it?

11:25.146 --> 11:29.664
The mole on the ear, it,
uh, it was darker.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.160
Like that?

11:34.195 --> 11:36.992
No, it's too dark.
Too dark.

11:37.027 --> 11:39.470
Mr. Monk, it doesn't need
to be perfect, all right?

11:39.505 --> 11:40.546
It's, it's just a sketch.

11:40.581 --> 11:42.390
We've been here for
over an hour and a half.

11:42.425 --> 11:44.843
Okay? I, I think we're
done with the ear, huh?

11:44.878 --> 11:46.976
Okay, not quite.

11:47.011 --> 11:50.435
- Hey. Where you been?
- Check it out. It's a Rolex.

11:50.470 --> 11:53.327
200 bucks, and it's gold-plated.

11:53.362 --> 11:55.925
-Where'd you get it?
-Met a guy who knew a guy.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.318
Never needs batteries.

11:57.353 --> 12:01.184
Well, of course not.
It runs on stupidity.

12:01.219 --> 12:02.974
Randy, you're so gullible,
it's frightening.

12:03.009 --> 12:04.306
Yeah, well, it does everything.

12:04.341 --> 12:06.956
Look, I can tell you what time
it is all around the world.

12:06.991 --> 12:09.578
It's 5:30 here.
In Denver, it's 3:30.

12:09.613 --> 12:14.782
In Los Angeles, 12:17.
And in Paris, France...

12:14.817 --> 12:18.221
- time has stopped.
- Perfect.

12:18.256 --> 12:20.210
Thank god.
All right, let's move on,

12:20.245 --> 12:22.226
All right,
Tell me about this guy's eyes.

12:22.261 --> 12:26.386
I didn't see his eyes.
He was covering his face, so...

12:26.421 --> 12:27.877
All I saw was a left ear.

12:27.912 --> 12:31.710
What are we supposed to do with this?
I can't distribute this.

12:31.745 --> 12:34.520
- I'd recognize him.
- From this?

12:34.555 --> 12:38.072
Every ear is different.
They're like fingerprints.

12:38.107 --> 12:41.579
- Hey, how's it going?
- This is all that he saw.

12:41.614 --> 12:43.473
You know what?

12:43.508 --> 12:46.099
The earlobe was a little rounder.

12:49.109 --> 12:51.114
-Monk!
-well?

12:51.149 --> 12:53.386
I got bad news and some
really bad news.

12:53.421 --> 12:54.746
What do you want to hear first?

12:54.781 --> 12:58.578
Uh, let's see, I think, uh,
the really bad, I guess, first,

12:58.613 --> 13:03.297
or no, start, just start with the bad,
or, or the really bad. I, I, I...

13:03.332 --> 13:05.667
this morning,
Warrick Tennyson agreed

13:05.702 --> 13:08.314
to testify in this big federal
racketeering case.

13:08.349 --> 13:11.349
He is in protective custody,
incommunicado.

13:11.384 --> 13:13.603
They're not going to let us
or anybody anywhere near him.

13:13.638 --> 13:15.437
Didn't you tell them about Trudy?

13:15.472 --> 13:18.038
Look, I was up there for an hour
and a half screaming my head off.

13:18.073 --> 13:21.491
They said yes on one condition.

13:24.065 --> 13:26.167
What, what, what,
what's the condition?

13:26.202 --> 13:28.238
It's about this new case.

13:28.273 --> 13:30.316
The, uh, assassination thing.

13:30.351 --> 13:33.542
The D. A said if we help
with this ambassador case,

13:33.577 --> 13:35.697
they'll let us talk to Tennyson.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.608
What do you think?

13:38.643 --> 13:42.097
Well, well, I guess,
I guess I don't have...

13:51.881 --> 13:54.186
I guess I don't real...

13:55.417 --> 13:57.654
I guess I don't real...

13:58.475 --> 13:59.855
I guess I don't..

14:02.659 --> 14:04.923
I guess I don't real...

14:09.629 --> 14:12.213
I mean, I guess I don't...

14:18.570 --> 14:20.305
I guess I don't really...

14:26.265 --> 14:28.217
I guess I don't really...

14:33.487 --> 14:35.349
I guess I don't...

14:38.318 --> 14:40.935
I guess I don't really have...

14:47.126 --> 14:48.649
I guess I don't really...

14:53.125 --> 14:55.085
I guess I don't really...

14:55.782 --> 14:58.563
I guess I don't
really have a choice!

15:03.596 --> 15:08.123
It's big news. Not just here,
all over the world.

15:08.158 --> 15:11.687
When Trudy died, she wasn't
on the front page.

15:11.722 --> 15:13.345
She was on page 4.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.109
The next day, there was
a little story on page 10.

15:16.144 --> 15:19.908
And the next day...
she was gone.

15:19.943 --> 15:21.436
Adrian, she's not gone.

15:21.471 --> 15:23.903
We're going to find the people
who killed her, I promise.

15:23.938 --> 15:25.560
And don't forget.

15:25.595 --> 15:28.486
if we help them with this,
they're going to help us.

15:28.521 --> 15:29.950
Vladamir Kazinsky,

15:29.985 --> 15:31.529
-Captain Stottlemeyer.
-Good to see you.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.192
Adrian Monk and, uh, Sharona Fleming.

15:34.227 --> 15:36.964
Mr. Kazinsky's with the Latvian embassy.

15:36.999 --> 15:40.884
So you were here with the ambassador
about an hour before the murder.

15:40.919 --> 15:44.365
No, not even one hour.
20 minutes.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.896
I just can't believe he's gone.
What are you looking at?

15:48.613 --> 15:50.870
Your left ear.

15:50.905 --> 15:54.063
-What's wrong with it?
-Nothing. It's...

15:54.098 --> 15:58.151
Sir, we're trying to retrace
where the ambassador was

15:58.186 --> 16:00.647
and where he went and who
he might have met.

16:00.682 --> 16:05.181
Well, uh...
We, uh, met, uh, for drinks.

16:05.216 --> 16:07.569
We met every Wednesday,
and we stood right over there.

16:07.604 --> 16:11.658
- Just the two of you.
- He had his bodyguards with him.

16:12.741 --> 16:14.478
Oh, and, and, um,

16:14.513 --> 16:17.399
did he seem worried about
anything, or frightened?

16:17.434 --> 16:21.930
Not at all.
He was, uh, how do you, upbeat.

16:21.965 --> 16:25.996
Mr. Kazinsky, I overheard the
ambassador say something just,

16:26.031 --> 16:28.395
just before he was killed.

16:28.430 --> 16:31.940
"She is now gone meatless."

16:31.975 --> 16:35.404
-"She is now gone meatless?"
-Does that mean anything to you?

16:36.429 --> 16:38.354
Maybe he knew a woman
who's a vegetarian.

16:38.389 --> 16:42.348
I, I mean does it have
any meaning in latvian?

16:42.383 --> 16:44.601
No.
No, I'm sorry.

16:44.636 --> 16:47.931
-Thank you, Mr. Kazinsky.
-She's now gone meatless?

16:47.966 --> 16:49.489
-No.
-That'll be all. I'll show you out.

16:49.524 --> 16:52.803
She's, she's now gone meatless?

16:52.838 --> 16:54.108
-No.
-We appreciate your time.

16:54.143 --> 16:55.525
If we have any more questions,
we'll get back to you.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.737
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you, sir. - Thank you.

16:57.772 --> 17:00.825
She's, she's now gone meatless.

17:00.860 --> 17:03.522
-"She's now gone meatless"?
-That's what he said.

17:03.557 --> 17:07.269
Maybe it's some kind of
slang, like hip-hop.

17:07.304 --> 17:09.784
-Hip-hop?
-Hip-hop. It's a sort of street talk.

17:09.819 --> 17:12.417
Why don't you ask around?

17:12.453 --> 17:16.343
Well, I'm not going to ask people
what "she's now gone meatless" means.

17:16.377 --> 17:18.320
Why not?

17:18.356 --> 17:19.505
I don't know. I might
move back here someday.

17:19.540 --> 17:20.598
I, I don't know.

17:20.634 --> 17:23.396
That was our supposed
friend detective Cage.

17:23.431 --> 17:25.603
He's got a lead.
He wants us to go to Brooklyn,

17:25.637 --> 17:27.729
talk to a man named Elmer Gratnik.

17:27.763 --> 17:30.563
Gratnik's been sending the ambassador
some threatening letters.

17:30.598 --> 17:33.223
Brooklyn, that, that's, like,
an old bridge, right?

17:33.258 --> 17:35.328
-Or a tunnel.
-Or a tunnel. Okay, a bridge.

17:35.363 --> 17:36.609
Look, I got a plan.
Here's the deal.

17:36.644 --> 17:38.362
-You two go to Brooklyn.
-No, Brooklyn, no.

17:38.397 --> 17:40.134
You go to Brooklyn,
you talk to Gratnik,

17:40.169 --> 17:42.144
you check out his earlobe
or whatever it is you do.

17:42.179 --> 17:43.591
Randy and I are going to snoop around here

17:43.626 --> 17:46.266
and see if we can't figure out where
these clowns are hiding our witness.

17:46.301 --> 17:50.473
Brooklyn?
Great. Let's meet back here at 11:00.

17:50.508 --> 17:52.995
Randy, it's 11:00 right now.

17:55.297 --> 17:57.638
Trudy loved New York.

17:57.673 --> 18:01.269
She always wanted to bring me here.

18:01.304 --> 18:04.603
-I guess now she has.
-Hmm.

18:04.638 --> 18:07.947
Wait, wait, wait.
That's Gratnik.

18:07.982 --> 18:09.700
Right over there.

18:09.735 --> 18:11.785
Cage says he always wears that hat.

18:11.820 --> 18:14.431
He's been seeking political
asylum for two years,

18:14.466 --> 18:16.125
but the INS keeps turning him down.

18:16.160 --> 18:20.787
-And he blamed the ambassador.
-Among others.

18:20.822 --> 18:22.823
So you think he's the guy you saw?

18:22.858 --> 18:25.778
Maybe. I can't tell.

18:25.813 --> 18:29.566
I need to see his left ear.
Look, how about this?

18:29.601 --> 18:32.513
You walk by.

18:32.548 --> 18:34.834
Maybe, maybe he'll tip his hat.

18:34.869 --> 18:36.510
Oh, he's not going
to tip his hat.

18:36.545 --> 18:39.725
He might if you sashay.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.589
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to talk to him.

18:41.624 --> 18:45.764
Look, sashay.
Sharona, sashay.

18:48.846 --> 18:53.517
- Um, excuse me, Mr. Gratnik?
- Shh.

18:57.308 --> 19:00.321
Now we talk.
You can bother him all you want.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.091
Okay.

19:02.126 --> 19:04.481
We're working with the police department
on the assassination.

19:04.516 --> 19:06.590
That was no assassination.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.453
Assassination is a word
they use for great men.

19:08.488 --> 19:14.326
Ambassador Krazluv was no great man.
Vins bija suns, he was a dog.

19:14.361 --> 19:19.182
- Excuse me. That, that is a nice hat.
- Thank you.

19:19.217 --> 19:20.674
Did you threaten him?

19:20.709 --> 19:24.336
I get mad, I say things,
but I don't hurt people.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.089
What is that?
Is that, is that mink?

19:26.124 --> 19:30.253
-Sable.
-Sable. Wow.

19:30.288 --> 19:33.581
- Could I, could I hold it?
- Why?

19:33.616 --> 19:35.777
I love hats.
I collect them.

19:35.812 --> 19:40.614
-I'm a, chapeau-ologist.
-No.

19:49.662 --> 19:53.567
Go away!

19:55.449 --> 19:58.699
- She's now gone meatless.
- What?

19:59.703 --> 20:03.706
Before he was killed,
the ambassador said something like

20:03.741 --> 20:06.143
"she's now gone meatless."

20:06.178 --> 20:07.553
Does that mean anything to you?

20:07.588 --> 20:08.974
Excuse me.

20:09.009 --> 20:13.096
I think you are saying "sis nav
mans metelis," "sis nav mans metelis"

20:13.131 --> 20:14.450
which is not really Latvian.

20:14.485 --> 20:17.983
It's a completely different
dialect, called high Tamien,

20:18.018 --> 20:21.642
but some people speak both.

20:21.677 --> 20:26.905
-What does it mean?
-That means "this is not my coat."

20:28.185 --> 20:32.297
This is not my coat.
This is not my coat.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.345
Oh, I can teach you a new phrase.

20:34.380 --> 20:37.046
Sah mats. Checkmate. Sah mats

20:37.081 --> 20:42.123
Velns paravis.
Idritvai kocin!

20:49.673 --> 20:51.609
Idritvai kocin.

21:34.600 --> 21:38.007
Warrick Tennyson.
I knew it.

21:38.642 --> 21:41.199
Trial transcripts...

21:41.234 --> 21:42.780
Deposition...

21:42.815 --> 21:44.331
Cage said he didn't know
anything about the Tennyson.

21:44.366 --> 21:46.240
He's lying to us.

21:46.275 --> 21:48.992
He's lying to us.

21:49.027 --> 21:50.796
What is that?

21:50.831 --> 21:52.282
It's my watch.
It beeps every hour.

21:52.317 --> 21:53.495
Well, turn it off.

21:53.530 --> 21:56.506
I can't. The instructions were in korean.

21:57.017 --> 21:58.827
Well, do it something.

22:00.966 --> 22:04.596
-Smash it.
-No. It's a Rolex.

22:09.528 --> 22:11.893
Mister? Mister, are you okay?

22:12.861 --> 22:16.682
- Oh, he, he, he's fine.
- He's crying.

22:17.608 --> 22:19.842
We couldn't find a cab.

22:20.732 --> 22:23.549
Is there anything I can do to help?

22:24.076 --> 22:27.777
Make it stop.

22:37.121 --> 22:40.107
See? You did it.
You rode the subway.

22:40.142 --> 22:42.753
I'm proud of you.
You're becoming a real New Yorker.

22:42.788 --> 22:44.132
I rode on the subway.

22:44.167 --> 22:45.966
-Change?
-Yes, I think I did.

22:46.001 --> 22:48.548
Okay, this is our exit,
so stay close to me.

22:48.583 --> 22:52.057
I keep thinking about
what the ambassador said.

22:52.092 --> 22:54.984
"this is not my coat."

22:55.019 --> 22:57.086
-But it was his coat.
-I know. I can't figure it out.

22:57.121 --> 22:58.967
And how did it get wet?

22:59.002 --> 23:02.806
I think that coat
is the key to, oh, my god.

23:02.841 --> 23:06.727
- Oh. - He's urinating!
- Oh, come.

23:06.762 --> 23:09.851
hey, hey, hey, come on!
What are you doing?

23:09.886 --> 23:12.037
There are people here!

23:12.072 --> 23:15.364
Come on.
Adrian, I'm really sorry that...

23:15.399 --> 23:16.490
what are you doing?

23:16.525 --> 23:18.105
Adrian, what are you doing?

23:18.140 --> 23:21.168
Are you crazy?
Why did you go on there?

23:21.203 --> 23:23.511
Adrian, what are you, stop!

23:23.546 --> 23:26.862
Stop the train!
Adrian!

23:31.064 --> 23:33.569
Sir, you have to stop that train!
He's all alone!

23:33.604 --> 23:35.819
-He's gonna mad, I swear!
-Okay, okay, okay. Shh, calm down.

23:35.854 --> 23:38.349
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

23:38.384 --> 23:39.934
Ma'am, this happens all the time.
What's his name?

23:39.969 --> 23:41.773
-Um, Adrian Monk.
-Okay, how old is he?

23:41.808 --> 23:44.139
He's 45.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.252
Taxi!

23:50.658 --> 23:51.958
Taxi.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.581
Taxi.

23:56.741 --> 24:00.136
Taxi, Taxi.

24:17.727 --> 24:20.133
Find the queen,
find the queen, all right?

24:20.168 --> 24:22.275
We are happy people here
in New York city

24:22.310 --> 24:23.734
trying to find the queen, all right?

24:23.769 --> 24:25.758
Find the queen, you're living a dream.

24:25.793 --> 24:27.617
You find the Jack,
you don't get nothing back.

24:27.652 --> 24:29.706
Okay, nothing at all.
I'm sorry, you don't.

24:29.741 --> 24:31.734
Except love.
I give love to everyone.

24:31.769 --> 24:34.357
Here we go.
Who see the queen, huh?

24:34.392 --> 24:36.577
Who see it?
You see the queen?

24:36.612 --> 24:38.032
Come over here, man.

24:38.067 --> 24:39.882
Put your money down
on the table, boy.

24:39.917 --> 24:41.340
Show me you got the cash, all right?

24:41.375 --> 24:44.126
$5 will get you $10,
$10 will get you $20, all right?

24:44.161 --> 24:45.749
Put it down on the table, okay?

24:45.784 --> 24:47.166
Show me the queen.

24:47.201 --> 24:48.963
Show me the queen, man.

24:48.998 --> 24:51.539
Right here?

24:52.591 --> 24:54.785
All right, all right.
You a pretty smart fella.

24:54.820 --> 24:56.258
Smart fella playing the game.

24:56.293 --> 24:57.672
No, no, no, no.
We going to go again.

24:57.707 --> 24:59.554
We going to go again,
double or nothing, all right?

24:59.589 --> 25:01.595
Double or nothing. Put
the money down. There you go.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.685
That's all right, you know?
I don't get mad when I lose.

25:03.720 --> 25:06.101
Never get mad when I lose.
I just be glad when I win.

25:06.136 --> 25:07.724
Very glad when I win, okay?

25:07.759 --> 25:09.120
Here we go.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.725
Where the queen, huh? huh?

25:12.760 --> 25:14.537
You see the queen again?

25:21.458 --> 25:23.542
Game over.

25:23.577 --> 25:25.334
Uh, well, what about my winnings?

25:25.369 --> 25:27.891
Look, me keeping it.
You cheated.

25:27.926 --> 25:29.218
Excuse me.

25:29.253 --> 25:31.530
I, I'd like to see
your license.

25:31.565 --> 25:34.758
-My what?
-Your gaming license.

25:35.389 --> 25:37.218
I left it at home.

25:37.253 --> 25:38.905
Yeah, man, oh, I left it at home.

25:38.940 --> 25:40.672
You know, you just you reminded me.

25:40.707 --> 25:41.865
Stay right here, okay?

25:41.900 --> 25:43.862
-I'll go get it.
-Don't, don't take all day.

25:43.897 --> 25:46.703
No, no, I'll be right back, man.

25:47.461 --> 25:51.040
His license better be current.

25:52.906 --> 25:55.952
Don't worry.
We'll find him.

25:55.987 --> 25:58.379
We got 1,000 uniforms out there looking.

25:58.414 --> 25:59.900
This whole city's laid out on a grid.

25:59.935 --> 26:02.285
That's a good thing.
He likes grids.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.326
How long has he been missing?

26:04.361 --> 26:06.586
Four hours.

26:06.621 --> 26:09.641
21/2 hours.

26:09.676 --> 26:10.905
Okay, look, look,

26:10.940 --> 26:12.953
I've seen him in situations
like this, okay?

26:12.988 --> 26:16.473
He, he gets very overwhelmed,
and he can't think straight.

26:16.508 --> 26:19.339
Ma'am, you're describing
half the people in this city.

26:19.374 --> 26:20.641
Afternoon.

26:20.676 --> 26:23.318
Oh, I hear, uh, wonder boy
is missing in action.

26:23.353 --> 26:24.934
Hey, Walter,

26:24.969 --> 26:26.092
you got a minute?

26:26.127 --> 26:28.562
-Not right now.
-I think you do.

26:34.684 --> 26:37.375
We didn't fly 3,000 miles to see "cats."

26:37.410 --> 26:39.908
Yeah, well, "cats" is closed.

26:39.943 --> 26:42.675
I was straight up with you
from the moment I shook your hand.

26:42.710 --> 26:45.051
Are you accusing me of something?

26:45.086 --> 26:48.780
Warrick Tennyson is dying from
kidney failure and heart disease.

26:48.815 --> 26:53.616
He probably will not live long
enough to talk to us, and you knew it.

26:56.335 --> 26:58.367
How long does he have?

26:58.402 --> 27:01.069
He's got two, three days, maybe.

27:01.104 --> 27:02.862
He's in some hospital,
nobody knows where,

27:02.897 --> 27:05.138
and the D. A's been deposing him
on that racketeering case,

27:05.173 --> 27:06.588
and they're afraid that they're
going to lose him

27:06.623 --> 27:07.718
before they get what they need.

27:07.753 --> 27:10.495
They're not going to let
anybody get near him.

27:11.244 --> 27:13.932
-You gave me your word.
-Come on, I didn't lie to you.

27:13.967 --> 27:15.389
If we close the ambassador case...

27:15.424 --> 27:18.386
Look, I don't care about
the frigging ambassador.

27:18.421 --> 27:20.737
He means less than zero to me, okay?

27:20.772 --> 27:23.225
My friend's wife got blown up.

27:23.260 --> 27:25.034
You understand?

27:25.069 --> 27:27.818
And it killed him, too.

27:28.417 --> 27:31.460
In a way.

27:33.869 --> 27:36.099
If we close this case,

27:36.134 --> 27:38.032
we can call city hall,
we can call the press,

27:38.067 --> 27:40.293
we're going to have juice.
Come on, you know how this works.

27:40.328 --> 27:43.293
They won't dare say no to us.

27:43.328 --> 27:46.064
Captain, it's not just
your best shot.

27:46.099 --> 27:49.325
It's your only shot.

28:31.226 --> 28:36.360
And few there be that find it.
Praise the lord.

28:36.395 --> 28:40.701
A cleansing is coming.
There will be a reckoning.

28:40.736 --> 28:46.576
A cleansing is coming.
Who would like to see a cleansing?

28:49.160 --> 28:51.167
I would, I would.

28:51.202 --> 28:53.878
They found him.
He's in Times Square.

28:53.913 --> 28:55.568
Oh, my god.

28:55.603 --> 29:00.498
There will be a reckoning
because judgment day is coming!

29:00.533 --> 29:03.435
Testify, brother!

29:05.710 --> 29:09.350
Ha ha! Whoo!
Speak unto it, brother!

29:09.385 --> 29:13.259
- Get it said!
- But it's still not too late.

29:13.294 --> 29:14.797
-Is that him?
-Yeah.

29:14.832 --> 29:17.064
Oh, my god!

29:17.099 --> 29:21.481
- Oh, my god!
- You fornicators! Save yourselves!

29:21.516 --> 29:24.617
- Adrian, what are you doing?
- We're spreading the word.

29:24.652 --> 29:26.282
Yeah, you're spreading something.

29:26.317 --> 29:28.297
Don't listen to her, Jorel.

29:28.332 --> 29:30.480
I know her.

29:30.515 --> 29:32.632
-She's a fornicator.
-Adrian, Adrian, no.

29:32.667 --> 29:34.649
- Fornicator!
- Fornicator!

29:34.684 --> 29:36.420
- Fornicator!
- Fornicator!

29:36.455 --> 29:38.252
Fornicator!

29:38.287 --> 29:39.586
-Stop it!
-Come here.

29:39.621 --> 29:42.878
-Fornicator!
-Shame on you!

29:45.246 --> 29:47.336
Hold still.

29:47.852 --> 29:50.708
-Is he okay?
-Yes, he's fine.

29:51.866 --> 29:55.402
Captain, captain, there is,

29:55.437 --> 29:58.954
a card game on 49th street.
I think it might be rigged.

29:58.989 --> 30:00.680
Okay, well, we'll look
into that, all right?

30:00.715 --> 30:03.776
Adrian, here, here,
I bought you some water.

30:03.811 --> 30:05.947
Did you ever find Warrick Tennyson?

30:05.982 --> 30:07.755
We're working on that.

30:07.790 --> 30:11.243
They've got the home field advantage,
but we're still working on it.

30:11.278 --> 30:13.840
Why don't we go back to the hotel
and get some rest, okay?

30:13.875 --> 30:15.832
Come on.

30:18.056 --> 30:21.548
That's the guy from the hotel.

30:21.583 --> 30:23.022
What, the shooter?

30:23.057 --> 30:26.641
-How do you know?
-His ear. I'd recognize it anywhere.

30:26.676 --> 30:28.933
Yeah, his name's Steven Leight.

30:28.968 --> 30:32.228
His wife was just killed in Central Park.
I was just reading about him.

30:32.263 --> 30:35.149
Wait, and he killed the ambassador?

30:36.283 --> 30:39.703
-What's the connection?
-I don't know, I don't know.

30:39.738 --> 30:43.032
But he's the guy.

30:43.067 --> 30:46.136
I've never been more sure.

30:49.742 --> 30:51.370
What time is it?

30:52.296 --> 30:54.211
Not you.

30:56.218 --> 30:58.440
Ooh, he's coming,
he's coming.

30:59.391 --> 31:00.951
Steven Leight.

31:00.986 --> 31:04.178
Hi, I'm Leland Stottlemeyer,
San Francisco homicide.

31:04.213 --> 31:07.632
This is lieutenant Disher,
Sharona Fleming...

31:07.667 --> 31:10.277
and that's Adrian Monk.

31:10.312 --> 31:15.171
-He's helping us out.
-He's nearsighted.

31:15.206 --> 31:18.093
You were supposed to meet us
at your apartment nearly an hour ago.

31:18.128 --> 31:20.510
-You weren't there.
-Are you avoiding us, sir?

31:20.545 --> 31:23.149
No, no, no. I, I'm sorry.
I, I forgot, you know?

31:23.184 --> 31:25.893
It's, I'm just, I'm not thinking
very straight right now.

31:25.928 --> 31:27.855
It's, it's, it's been
a terrible week.

31:27.890 --> 31:30.030
Your assistant said
we might find you here,

31:30.065 --> 31:31.439
that you were doing some errands.

31:31.474 --> 31:33.569
Yeah, that's right. I,

31:33.604 --> 31:35.618
I went to the pharmacy.

31:35.653 --> 31:40.071
You know, I, I've already
talked to the police, five times.

31:40.106 --> 31:42.667
I told them everything I know.

31:42.702 --> 31:44.004
-Oh, my god.
-What?

31:44.039 --> 31:45.386
Oh, my god.

31:45.421 --> 31:47.495
-Oh, my god.
-What's wrong?

31:47.530 --> 31:49.684
That girl, that, that girl.

31:49.719 --> 31:52.258
One of her gloves is missing.

31:52.293 --> 31:56.567
Mr. Leight, would you mind
telling us your story again?

31:56.602 --> 31:58.692
-You guys are from San Francisco, right?
-Yep.

31:58.727 --> 32:00.183
I, I don't understand.

32:00.218 --> 32:01.600
What does Beverly's murder
have to do with you?

32:01.635 --> 32:02.883
We're working on a different case,

32:02.918 --> 32:05.299
but we think there might
be a connection.

32:05.334 --> 32:09.613
Excuse me.
Hey, excuse me.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.609
what, what happened
to your other glove there?

32:13.644 --> 32:16.945
I lost it.

32:16.980 --> 32:18.416
She, she lost it, for god's sake.

32:18.451 --> 32:21.049
Go ahead.

32:21.084 --> 32:23.630
Two days ago, it was,
it was our anniversary.

32:23.665 --> 32:25.140
We had tickets to the matinee.

32:25.175 --> 32:27.738
We were supposed to meet
out in front of the theater,

32:27.773 --> 32:29.206
and she never showed up.

32:29.241 --> 32:32.542
Mr. Leight, excuse me.

32:32.577 --> 32:35.757
Uh, I, I called everybody
that we knew.

32:35.792 --> 32:37.614
Finally I called the police, and...

32:37.649 --> 32:40.352
-Excuse me!
-They had just found her body

32:40.387 --> 32:43.224
over by the boat pond in Central Park.

32:43.259 --> 32:47.681
The cops, they, they think that,
they think that she resisted.

32:47.716 --> 32:50.752
-And what do you think?
-I don't know, you know?

32:50.787 --> 32:53.118
She was, she was wearing
her grandmother's necklace,

32:53.153 --> 32:54.984
and it meant the world to her.

32:55.019 --> 32:57.333
I think if somebody probably
tried to take that,

32:57.368 --> 32:59.702
she would have fought back.

32:59.737 --> 33:03.119
Now I, uh, I can't believe
that she's gone.

33:03.154 --> 33:04.544
Show me your hands.

33:04.579 --> 33:07.894
Show me, see? Okay.

33:07.929 --> 33:12.561
Go. Go, go skate.
Go.

33:12.596 --> 33:14.273
How many years had you been married?

33:14.308 --> 33:15.673
Seven years.

33:15.708 --> 33:18.065
I'm so, Mr. Leight, um,

33:18.100 --> 33:21.095
-do you live alone, sir?
-Yeah, now I do.

33:21.130 --> 33:24.364
Who are you sleeping with?

33:25.303 --> 33:27.821
What, what, what are
you talking about?

33:27.856 --> 33:31.243
Well, your wife just died, but...

33:31.278 --> 33:35.179
-you're not sleeping alone, are you?
-Of course I am.

33:35.214 --> 33:38.601
Well, you just bought
some snoring medicine.

33:38.636 --> 33:42.622
There's only one reason
a man buys snoring medicine.

33:42.657 --> 33:45.263
You're keeping somebody else awake.

33:45.298 --> 33:47.369
This conversation's over, okay?

33:47.404 --> 33:49.921
I don't have to talk to you,
and I don't want to talk to you.

33:49.956 --> 33:53.259
If you have any more questions,
here, I'll tell you what.

33:53.294 --> 33:55.392
why don't you take a quarter?
You call my lawyer.

33:55.427 --> 33:59.578
What, what is that? Uh, a mint?
Could I see that?

33:59.613 --> 34:03.515
Unbelievable.
You want it, take it.

34:03.550 --> 34:05.553
Have a good day.

34:09.868 --> 34:11.071
They're identical.

34:12.063 --> 34:13.733
Which means...

34:14.569 --> 34:15.567
what?

34:15.601 --> 34:17.936
It means Steven Leight
was in this bar recently.

34:17.971 --> 34:22.636
Steven leight and the ambassador
were both in this bar.

34:22.670 --> 34:28.168
-Uh, this isn't mine.
-Oh, sorry.

34:28.203 --> 34:31.889
I was looking at the wrong ticket.

34:31.925 --> 34:34.020
What's wrong with me?

34:34.054 --> 34:35.681
Here we go.

34:48.435 --> 34:50.857
What's going on?
Nobody's told me anything.

34:50.891 --> 34:52.440
Yeah, join the club.

34:52.476 --> 34:55.981
Mr. Leight, have you ever
been inside this bar before?

34:56.016 --> 34:57.686
Maybe. I don't remember.

34:57.721 --> 35:00.190
Maybe I can refresh your memory.

35:00.225 --> 35:04.205
You were here on Wednesday just
minutes after you killed your wife.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.236
Ha ha. You're crazy.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.915
Here's what happened.

35:07.950 --> 35:11.495
You took your wife to the park,
and you found a secluded area,

35:11.530 --> 35:14.300
and when you were sure
no one was watching,

35:14.335 --> 35:15.344
you shot her.

35:15.379 --> 35:18.702
Then you took her jewelry
to make it look like a robbery.

35:18.737 --> 35:21.177
Afterwards, you were
pretty shaken up.

35:21.212 --> 35:23.636
Cold-blooded murder has a
tendency to do that.

35:23.671 --> 35:28.020
So you decided to have a drink
before you called the police.

35:28.055 --> 35:30.684
Of course, you didn't notice
that the ambassador from Latvia

35:30.719 --> 35:32.656
was sitting just a few feet away.

35:32.691 --> 35:35.351
Why would you?
You'd never met the man.

35:35.386 --> 35:37.920
But then your worlds collided.

35:37.955 --> 35:41.925
The coat check girl gave
him your coat by mistake.

35:41.960 --> 35:45.184
From what I've seen, that happens
around here all the time.

35:45.219 --> 35:48.543
Later, when she gave you
the ambassador's coat,

35:48.578 --> 35:51.044
you immediately realized
what had happened.

35:51.079 --> 35:52.994
You had to get your coat back,

35:53.029 --> 35:55.161
because your wife's jewelry
was still in the pocket.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.061
It could have easily been traced.

35:57.096 --> 35:59.978
If anybody found it, they'd
know you'd killed her.

36:00.013 --> 36:01.903
You found the hotel key card,

36:01.938 --> 36:05.152
so you knew where he was staying.
You ran the whole way.

36:05.187 --> 36:08.059
You probably didn't even notice
that it started to rain.

36:08.094 --> 36:09.988
You. It was you.

36:10.023 --> 36:12.986
You filthy, disgusting animal.

36:13.021 --> 36:15.816
You make me sick!

36:18.403 --> 36:19.649
Me?

36:19.684 --> 36:21.945
What are you doing?
He's a busboy.

36:21.980 --> 36:25.364
Sharona, don't you recognize
him from the subway?

36:25.399 --> 36:28.827
He's the urinator.
Urinator!

36:28.862 --> 36:32.087
It was you. Don't, don't,
don't, don't try to deny it.

36:32.122 --> 36:34.042
-Monk...
-We saw what you...

36:34.077 --> 36:36.494
Monk! could we get back to the
quadruple homicide, please?

36:36.529 --> 36:39.057
Yeah, he followed the
ambassador to the hotel,

36:39.092 --> 36:41.274
the ambassador must have
noticed the jewelry,

36:41.309 --> 36:43.751
Leight killed them all,
switched coats,

36:43.786 --> 36:46.555
and that's how one of them was wet.
You.

36:46.590 --> 36:48.012
Where were you raised?

36:48.047 --> 36:50.986
I mean, how can you live
with yourself?

36:51.021 --> 36:52.544
Disgusting pig.

36:52.579 --> 36:55.313
And you work in the food service
industry, for god's sake.

36:55.348 --> 36:56.437
You control yourself.

36:56.472 --> 36:58.067
The ballistics check out.

36:58.102 --> 37:00.372
The wife was killed
with the same gun.

37:00.407 --> 37:05.661
Mr. Leight, you're under arrest for
four counts of premeditated homicide.

37:05.696 --> 37:10.201
Sir, captain Cage, I'm going
to need to borrow these handcuffs,

37:10.236 --> 37:12.182
'cause you're going down, Mr. Pee.

37:12.217 --> 37:16.225
- Monk.
- Adrian...

37:18.086 --> 37:20.825
That man took a whiz in the subway.

37:20.860 --> 37:24.092
That man killed four people in cold blood.

37:24.127 --> 37:26.855
Now, who do you think we should arrest?

37:35.653 --> 37:37.398
The murderer.

38:00.295 --> 38:01.879
How is he?

38:01.914 --> 38:05.356
He's on morphine,
so there's no pain.

38:05.391 --> 38:08.067
That's too bad.

38:08.102 --> 38:11.857
Could you excuse us for a minute?
Thank you.

38:18.741 --> 38:21.801
Uh, Mr. Tennyson, we're
here from San Francisco

38:21.836 --> 38:24.427
to talk to you about Trudy Monk.

38:24.462 --> 38:27.109
Do you remember her?

38:27.144 --> 38:30.149
Car bomb.

38:30.184 --> 38:33.793
That's right.

38:33.828 --> 38:41.712
A man, a man paid me $2,000
cash to build a bomb.

38:41.747 --> 38:45.950
10 pounds of plastique...

38:45.985 --> 38:49.004
magnesium charge.

38:50.863 --> 38:55.016
How, how was it detonated?

38:55.051 --> 38:57.319
Cell phone.

38:58.518 --> 39:01.223
Who was it?

39:01.258 --> 39:04.530
Who hired you?

39:04.565 --> 39:07.107
I don't know.

39:07.142 --> 39:11.127
I only met him one time...

39:11.162 --> 39:13.717
parking garage.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.380
What did he look like?

39:15.415 --> 39:21.931
It was dark.
I never saw his face.

39:21.966 --> 39:24.434
But I saw his hand.

39:27.538 --> 39:34.591
He had six fingers on his right hand.

39:34.626 --> 39:37.030
Freak.

39:40.568 --> 39:42.370
Could you...

39:42.405 --> 39:45.763
leave us alone for a minute?

39:46.736 --> 39:49.851
I'll meet you outside.

39:52.193 --> 39:56.652
-Are you sure?
-Oh, yeah.

39:56.687 --> 39:59.531
Let's go.

40:15.574 --> 40:17.969
You were the husband.

40:18.805 --> 40:21.478
I am the husband.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.405
Forgive me.

40:28.288 --> 40:30.204
Forgive you?

40:32.900 --> 40:35.905
This is me...

40:35.940 --> 40:38.711
turning off your morphine.

41:09.493 --> 41:12.288
And this...

41:12.323 --> 41:14.477
is Trudy...

41:14.512 --> 41:17.699
the woman you killed...

41:17.734 --> 41:21.747
turning it back on.

41:42.225 --> 41:43.156
You know, it's a shame.

41:43.191 --> 41:44.477
New York's the greatest
city in the world,

41:44.512 --> 41:46.478
and we couldn't even enjoy it.

41:46.513 --> 41:48.438
Well, I promise we're
coming back. I promise.

41:48.473 --> 41:49.820
Oh, yeah, let's do that.

41:49.855 --> 41:50.959
No, wait, I have a better idea.

41:50.994 --> 41:53.643
Why don't we never travel
anywhere ever again?

41:53.678 --> 41:55.745
We're going to be late.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.354
Is that a new watch?

41:57.389 --> 42:00.033
- Did you buy it in a store?
- Yeah.

42:00.068 --> 42:01.203
I bought it near a store.

42:01.238 --> 42:02.578
I mean, this one keeps perfect time.

42:02.613 --> 42:04.374
Swiss accuracy.

42:04.409 --> 42:05.954
-Your watch is smoking.
-What?

42:05.989 --> 42:08.530
Your watch is on fire.

42:14.605 --> 42:17.220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

42:17.255 --> 42:20.568
You guys, fine.
Not him.

42:20.603 --> 42:23.144
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hang on, hang on.

42:23.179 --> 42:24.876
I'm handcuffing him, okay?

42:24.911 --> 42:26.687
Yeah, I'm handcuffing him.

42:26.722 --> 42:28.439
He won't touch anything.

42:28.474 --> 42:30.577
-I promise.
-Plus double the meter.

42:30.612 --> 42:32.569
Yeah, let's come back
here real soon.

42:32.604 --> 42:35.554
And no talking!
