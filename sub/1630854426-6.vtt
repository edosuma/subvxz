00:09.960 --> 00:12.920
It's a bit awkward,
'cause she's your sister.

00:13.000 --> 00:13.840
But?

00:13.920 --> 00:17.240
She's started doing this thing
where I'll start talking,

00:17.320 --> 00:20.200
telling a story,
something that happened that day,

00:20.280 --> 00:22.360
something, something small,
some bollocks, I dunno.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.720
Anyway, I get to the point
of the story, and…

00:25.800 --> 00:27.320
Do you know anyone called Paul?

00:31.120 --> 00:32.040
What?

02:17.360 --> 02:18.360
Thanks, mate.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.400
Do you live here?

02:27.440 --> 02:28.800
Just visiting.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.880
Why?

02:31.160 --> 02:33.720
I'm a professor. I've written a book.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.040
What's it called?

02:43.880 --> 02:45.280
Did it take you long?

02:45.360 --> 02:46.840
Four years.

02:47.880 --> 02:48.960
You sold many?

02:50.040 --> 02:51.400
Sixty- two.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.760
Mostly to libraries.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.080
What's it about?

02:56.160 --> 02:58.760
It's about the anatomy, physiology,

02:58.840 --> 03:01.320
and pathology
of the nervous system of animals.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.360
What, like their brains?

03:03.440 --> 03:07.320
Brains, neural pathways. Uh- hmm.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.040
What, so you know
what animals are thinking?

03:09.120 --> 03:11.200
What's Spud thinking right now?

03:11.280 --> 03:12.480
Is he happy?

03:13.240 --> 03:18.000
Technically speaking,
if Spud isn't… thirsty,

03:18.080 --> 03:21.160
hungry, in danger, or pain, then…

03:23.120 --> 03:25.360
broadly speaking, I suppose he is.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.360
What about you?

03:52.560 --> 03:53.880
Broadly speaking…

04:01.280 --> 04:03.680
Well, I'd say with confidence,

04:04.760 --> 04:07.200
and in terms
that even Spud here would grasp,

04:08.200 --> 04:10.800
uh, I'm constantly thirsty,

04:12.560 --> 04:15.560
in exquisite pain, and…

04:17.480 --> 04:20.120
massive, colossal,

04:20.880 --> 04:25.480
clear and present, almost biblical danger.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.160
So, you want some acid?

04:44.800 --> 04:45.920
Yes.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.800
Check on one salmon,
one beef, one ceviche,

05:17.920 --> 05:21.320
two lobster, two chip,
two purple sprouting.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.720
Yes, Chef!

05:53.240 --> 05:54.400
Afternoon.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.800
Hey. Just checking how you're doing.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.320
Yeah, yeah, I'm not bad, not bad.
I'm okay.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.800
Where's Greta?

06:03.880 --> 06:06.440
Uh, she's with Mom and Dad. Mm.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.360
Have you spoken to Amandine?

06:10.400 --> 06:14.160
I've not, actually,
but I'm seeing her tonight, so…

06:17.800 --> 06:18.840
Is Jeff back?

06:20.840 --> 06:22.680
He's back tonight. Do you need him?

06:23.480 --> 06:24.600
No, no, no, all good.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.360
Just, um, ah when er…

06:28.880 --> 06:32.440
Once I've gone to see Amandine,
I might need to just pop down

06:32.520 --> 06:35.840
and see you guys for a little bit,
if that's…

06:45.320 --> 06:48.000
Listen, Lue, I should go.
I've gotta get back to it, you know.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.120
Okay, love.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.440
Love you.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.280
I love ya.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.360
- Ah!
- Hey!

08:04.080 --> 08:06.760
I was born in 1876,

08:07.440 --> 08:09.320
into a poor rural family.

08:10.560 --> 08:11.760
Thank you.

08:11.840 --> 08:15.000
And I came to Paris aged 16.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.920
And for six years,
I worked at a biscuit factory.

08:23.520 --> 08:24.720
But at night,

08:26.280 --> 08:29.040
I would draw the pictures
I saw in my mind.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.280
You are a genius, Madeleine.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.040
Coco knows this.

08:34.960 --> 08:38.520
If you get too big, she will destroy you.

08:39.160 --> 08:41.720
How can you say that?

08:41.760 --> 08:45.720
Coco is arguably the most
influential fashion designer of all time.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.320
- Madeleine…
- She revolutionised

08:47.400 --> 08:48.960
the way women dressed,

08:49.040 --> 08:52.200
whilst capitalising her status
as a fashion icon.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.960
What's more, you're marrying her.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.640
Madeleine…

08:56.760 --> 08:57.880
Yeah, I know.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.600
I should go, I think.

09:03.840 --> 09:04.960
- Why? It's not even 3:00.
- I know.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.040
I need to pick up the kids from school.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.960
Uh, what kids?

09:12.880 --> 09:14.080
Nothing.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.280
Madeleine.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.760
Oh, yes, I should go.

09:17.840 --> 09:18.840
Madeline…

09:26.320 --> 09:27.480
Why are you here?

09:30.040 --> 09:31.280
That's just it.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.200
I'm not.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.520
I'd like to welcome to the panel,

09:38.640 --> 09:41.240
from Cauis College, Dr. Rita Hamley,

09:41.320 --> 09:44.160
our very own Professor Junaid Gupta,

09:44.240 --> 09:46.240
from the University of Santa Fe,

09:46.320 --> 09:48.640
visiting professor Dr. Alison Brooker,

09:48.760 --> 09:52.000
and from the University of Exeter,
Dr. Jefferson Wilson.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.760
Psychology is the study of mental

09:54.880 --> 09:57.360
or behavioural disorders in…

09:57.440 --> 10:00.400
Historically,
there has been a…

10:06.200 --> 10:07.520
Dr. Wilson?

10:07.600 --> 10:10.520
Um, I'm sorry, what was the question?

10:10.600 --> 10:14.240
We recently used neuroimaging

10:14.320 --> 10:17.520
to investigate serotonergic
and dopaminergic

10:17.600 --> 10:22.000
neurotransmission in dogs
with canine compulsive disorder,

10:22.080 --> 10:24.160
or CCD.

10:25.360 --> 10:30.760
…to measure the serotonin
receptor availability.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.240
Dr. Wilson, is everything okay?

10:37.080 --> 10:38.480
Jeff's done something.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.440
Something terrible.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.760
He doesn't know I know, but…

10:53.360 --> 10:54.760
I know.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.240
I know everything.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.200
Traitors!

11:06.280 --> 11:07.520
Coco!

11:07.600 --> 11:09.640
- Coco?
- You betrayed me.

11:09.720 --> 11:10.960
- Coco, no!

11:11.040 --> 11:12.160
No, don't!

11:12.240 --> 11:15.200
- No, no!

11:15.280 --> 11:16.560
- Lue.
- No, no.

11:18.520 --> 11:19.800
No, no!

11:43.800 --> 11:44.800
Hello?

11:47.080 --> 11:48.280
Leave me alone.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.760
What are you doing?

11:51.680 --> 11:53.040
Please don't jump.

11:56.360 --> 12:00.280
Whatever it is,
whatever's happening,

12:02.120 --> 12:03.640
it's not too late.

12:05.640 --> 12:08.600
Please. You're all right.

12:13.840 --> 12:14.720
Here.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.960
Here, grab me.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.640
You're all right.

12:20.720 --> 12:21.920
You're all right.

12:26.360 --> 12:27.560
What's your name?

12:31.680 --> 12:32.840
Jeff.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.160
Do I know you?

12:48.880 --> 12:52.200
Right, I've locked the back door.
I'll see you later.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.320
Do you want me to bring anything?

12:54.400 --> 12:56.080
Uh, just yourselves.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.480
What are we having?

12:57.560 --> 13:00.880
- Beef wellington.
- Ah, Dom's favourite. Can't wait.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.600
- See you!
- See you.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.520
Hello, Jamie.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.640
The baby was yours.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.400
Fine. Whatever.

14:35.280 --> 14:36.280
You know, I just thought…

14:36.360 --> 14:38.000
I dunno how you’d know that, but…

14:38.080 --> 14:39.200
- I know.
- Great.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.600
Terrific.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.120
- I'm sure you have questions.
- Me?

14:58.200 --> 14:59.280
Nah.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.920
Nah. You know, blah, blah, blah,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.640
"Oh, I get it! Oh, I see now, of course!

15:04.720 --> 15:05.880
- Silly me!"
- Jamie…

15:05.960 --> 15:06.960
I'm gonna go in a minute.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.280
But before I do…

15:13.680 --> 15:14.680
Dave,

15:15.960 --> 15:17.000
Jason…

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Jeff.

15:29.560 --> 15:30.720
My best friend,

15:30.800 --> 15:32.800
best man, at our wedding.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.080
Lue's husband.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.480
Greta's uncle.

15:42.720 --> 15:46.920
Father to my parents'
other two grandchildren, Wilf and Lily.

15:47.800 --> 15:48.920
Greta.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.320
My parents.

15:54.840 --> 15:55.840
Lue.

16:02.800 --> 16:03.800
Me.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.480
Okay.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.360
"I call from the deep!

16:14.760 --> 16:16.000
Follow me!

16:16.080 --> 16:19.640
Come with me, Jamie,
let's go on a magic carpet ride!

16:19.720 --> 16:20.960
Oh, look, there's a whale!

16:21.040 --> 16:22.440
By the way, I'm pregnant!

16:22.520 --> 16:25.000
Who cares? I'm floating on air!"

16:30.960 --> 16:32.560
I smashed your violin.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.840
- I know.
- Good.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.520
I get it, I know it's,
you know, priceless,

16:39.600 --> 16:41.040
one of a kind, all that, you know,

16:41.120 --> 16:42.920
I don't know how you'll ever get over it.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.920
So, that's that?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.480
It's over, but you don't
even want to know why?

16:57.560 --> 16:58.800
All right, go on then.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.040
For a laugh, let's have a giggle.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.360
You tell me, go on.

17:01.440 --> 17:05.880
You share with me, oh mysterious one,
oh Amandine,

17:05.960 --> 17:10.760
why hast thou swapped our lives
for a cheap fuck,

17:10.800 --> 17:12.960
for lots of cheap fucks?

17:13.040 --> 17:14.960
- Does the amount matter?
- Well, it does to me.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.640
It does if one of 'em's my best friend.

17:16.720 --> 17:17.720
Okay.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.680
But forget about Jeff for a moment.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.240
Okay, well, it's difficult to do that.

17:21.320 --> 17:23.320
I mean, like, it's really fucking hard.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.800
But if it was just the other two,
or, say, one…

17:25.920 --> 17:27.560
- Do you wanna pick one, or shall I?
- Jamie…

17:27.680 --> 17:30.800
To be clear, one is devastating!

17:33.800 --> 17:35.440
- It's cataclysmic!
- Cataclysmic?

17:35.520 --> 17:36.560
Catastrophic!

17:36.680 --> 17:37.680
Okay, so one is enough.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.560
One is ample.

17:43.560 --> 17:44.560
Okay.

17:47.760 --> 17:48.760
Okay.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.000
I cannot imagine how it felt.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.320
The thought of it.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.480
Me doing it with someone else,

18:03.240 --> 18:07.320
the things that we did, and other things.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.320
With Dave, the sex was okay.

18:17.320 --> 18:18.320
Not amazing.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.560
Jason was better.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.440
He liked to roleplay.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.040
You know, like, fantasy stuff.

18:28.320 --> 18:29.520
Crazy shit.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.640
He was pretty open- minded.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.440
Jeff I feel bad about.

18:39.320 --> 18:42.000
The first time we were doing it,
I thought,

18:43.440 --> 18:45.560
"Amandine, what the fuck are you doing?

18:45.680 --> 18:47.680
This is Jamie's best friend.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.760
What kind of a monster are you?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.800
Just stop, stop it, stop.

18:55.880 --> 18:58.520
It's just fucking wrong,
it's so fucking…"

18:59.280 --> 19:00.320
but then,

19:02.520 --> 19:05.800
suddenly I just came really hard.

19:09.480 --> 19:11.040
Huge orgasm.

19:12.480 --> 19:13.760
For about a minute.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.680
It's not what he was doing.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.760
I mean, he was good, don't get me wrong,

19:23.800 --> 19:28.920
but, uh, it was more,
I dunno, the situation.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.760
Yeah, I know it's hard to hear,
but it's better to know, right?

19:38.400 --> 19:42.240
Otherwise it'll just… drive you crazy.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.240
Look,

19:49.640 --> 19:51.800
I know what I did was terrible.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.160
I've done terrible things.

19:53.240 --> 19:56.040
Cheating is bad,
cheating is awful, cheating is…

20:03.720 --> 20:05.400
But then, is it?

20:07.800 --> 20:09.480
I mean, it's only sex.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.160
We have contraception.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.520
And monogamy, it's a beautiful idea,

20:16.560 --> 20:19.880
but you have to admit
it's pretty fucking hard, right?

20:20.560 --> 20:24.080
Asking one man to represent
the whole of manhood for you.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.480
He is the man, she is the woman,

20:27.560 --> 20:29.080
the only one that there will ever be,

20:29.200 --> 20:32.080
her vagina is all vaginas,
his cock, the cock.

20:32.200 --> 20:36.160
I mean, you have to admit,
it's hard to live up to, right?

20:39.440 --> 20:42.560
And faithful people, well…

20:44.480 --> 20:47.640
they just sneak off
and masturbate over someone else.

20:48.920 --> 20:52.240
He's in the toilet imagining
fucking the girl from work.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.760
She's in the bedroom imagining sucking off
the guy from the gym,

20:56.800 --> 20:59.520
and then they both come out
and they bathe the kids together,

20:59.560 --> 21:01.320
watch Grand Designs.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.200
But they are faithful people,

21:06.960 --> 21:08.800
'cause they would never actually eat
the ice cream,

21:08.920 --> 21:11.440
because actually eating the ice cream
is wrong.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.240
Eating the ice cream is the worst thing
in the world, it's evil.

21:14.320 --> 21:15.800
You're only saying this
'cause you got caught.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.440
Oh, you didn't catch me.

21:19.760 --> 21:20.760
What?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.560
Do you remember our manifesto?

21:34.680 --> 21:36.200
Do you remember what it said?

21:39.240 --> 21:41.200
It said, "Love is impossible.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.920
If love is impossible,
we must believe in the impossible.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.120
We must believe in magic."

21:57.520 --> 22:01.560
That was seven years, three weeks,
and one day ago.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.840
This was last year.

24:27.840 --> 24:30.520
- Hey, Babe.
- Hey, you made it.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.600
Just in time.

24:32.520 --> 24:34.280
- How was it?
- Oh, you know.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.080
- How are the monkeys?
- Upstairs.

24:37.480 --> 24:38.480
They've been golden.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.560
That smells lovely.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.200
- What are we having?
- Beef Wellington.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.240
Hey, could you get some wine?

24:43.320 --> 24:44.800
- On it.
- Thank you.

24:52.640 --> 24:53.720
Ah, fuck.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.520
Hello?

25:08.920 --> 25:09.920
Yeah.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.440
Jeff.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.000
- Yeah.
- It's for you.

25:16.800 --> 25:17.800
Hello?

25:20.560 --> 25:21.800
Oh, hi Jamie.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.040
We need to talk.
