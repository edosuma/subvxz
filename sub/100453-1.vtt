00:31.363 --> 00:34.433
<i>They say,
if you wanna tell a story right,</i>

00:34.500 --> 00:36.402
<i>you gotta start
at the beginning.</i>

00:39.405 --> 00:42.108
<i>Too far? Fine.</i>

00:42.175 --> 00:45.477
<i>This is me, Harleen Quinzel.</i>

00:45.544 --> 00:46.847
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

00:46.913 --> 00:48.581
<i>my dad traded me
for a six-pack of beer.</i>

00:48.647 --> 00:50.083
<i>But however many times
he tried to ditch me...</i>

00:50.150 --> 00:51.350
Daddy!

00:51.417 --> 00:53.053
- <i>...I kept coming back.</i>
- Ah!

00:53.119 --> 00:55.155
<i>Eventually,
he found me a new home.</i>

00:55.222 --> 00:56.722
<i>The good sisters</i>

00:56.789 --> 00:59.092
<i>of St. Bernadette's
taught me a lot.</i>

01:00.659 --> 01:03.964
<i>But I was never
an establishment kinda gal.</i>

01:04.030 --> 01:06.266
<i>All things considered,
I did good.</i>

01:06.333 --> 01:07.600
<i>I even went to college.</i>

01:07.666 --> 01:09.169
<i>Got my PhD.</i>

01:09.236 --> 01:11.403
<i>Had my heart broken
once or twice.</i>

01:11.470 --> 01:13.572
<i>Finding love,
it's not easy.</i>

01:13.639 --> 01:15.976
<i>So I threw myself
into my work,</i>

01:16.042 --> 01:17.310
<i>became a psychiatrist.</i>

01:17.376 --> 01:19.511
<i>That's when I met him.</i>

01:19.578 --> 01:22.381
<i>Mr. J. My Joker.</i>

01:22.448 --> 01:23.884
<i>Oh, I fell hard.</i>

01:23.950 --> 01:26.485
<i>Like out of a plane
without a parachute,</i>

01:26.552 --> 01:27.653
<i>right in
your dumb fucking face</i>

01:27.720 --> 01:28.989
<i>kinda hard.</i>

01:29.055 --> 01:31.324
<i>I lost all sense
of who I was.</i>

01:31.390 --> 01:34.094
<i>I only had eyes for Puddin'.</i>

01:34.160 --> 01:35.728
<i>We all know the saying,</i>

01:35.794 --> 01:37.529
<i>"Behind every successful man</i>

01:37.596 --> 01:39.332
<i>there's a badass broad."</i>

01:39.398 --> 01:40.867
<i>Well, that was me.</i>

01:40.934 --> 01:42.802
<i>I was the brains
behind some of</i>

01:42.869 --> 01:44.603
- <i>Mr. J's greatest stunts.</i>
- Ha-ha!

01:44.670 --> 01:46.206
<i>Not that
he let anyone know it.</i>

01:46.273 --> 01:47.941
Puddin'?

01:48.008 --> 01:50.709
<i>I guess all good things
have to come to an end.</i>

01:51.845 --> 01:53.046
<i>So...</i>

01:55.514 --> 01:56.883
<i>...we broke up.</i>

01:58.751 --> 02:01.154
<i>I handled it real mature.</i>

02:01.221 --> 02:04.224
<i>But Mr. J was super
broke up about it.</i>

02:07.760 --> 02:12.731
<i>I got an amazing new place
that was all mine.</i>

02:15.168 --> 02:17.770
<i>It gave me the space
to really reflect</i>

02:17.837 --> 02:19.738
<i>on the mistakes of my past.</i>

02:23.642 --> 02:26.612
<i>I had to find
a new identity.</i>

02:27.948 --> 02:29.615
<i>A new me.</i>

02:32.651 --> 02:34.020
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

02:34.087 --> 02:36.755
<i>But after a while,
I even opened myself up</i>

02:36.823 --> 02:39.426
<i>to the possibility
of new love.</i>

02:42.461 --> 02:43.529
Hi.

02:43.595 --> 02:46.565
Hello, nice baby.

02:50.036 --> 02:51.704
<i>Here's the thing
about new love...</i>

02:51.770 --> 02:54.207
I take payment-in-kind.

02:54.274 --> 02:57.643
<i>...you have to feed it.</i>

03:07.553 --> 03:09.722
<i>Soon enough,
I was back on my feet.</i>

03:09.788 --> 03:13.360
<i>Ready to move on,
to make new friends.</i>

03:13.426 --> 03:16.463
<i>She means fucking business!</i>

03:16.528 --> 03:18.031
- <i>Oh, here we go!</i>
- Whip me!

03:18.098 --> 03:19.631
<i>She has taken
a whip from the pivot,</i>

03:19.698 --> 03:21.567
<i>catapulted to the high side!</i>

03:21.633 --> 03:23.535
<i>Oh!</i>

03:30.776 --> 03:33.213
Yeah! Come on!

03:33.279 --> 03:37.583
<i>It was time for Gotham
to meet the new Harley Quinn,</i>

03:37.649 --> 03:39.986
<i>so I really
put myself out there.</i>

03:40.053 --> 03:42.788
Ride that pole
like you ride your man!

03:47.961 --> 03:50.930
God damn it.
Sit the fuck down.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.265
What?

03:52.332 --> 03:56.002
I said sit your skinny ass
down, you dumb slut.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.736
Okay.

04:01.007 --> 04:03.376
You broke my fucking legs!

04:03.443 --> 04:04.978
Oh, boo-hoo.

04:09.215 --> 04:10.649
What?

04:10.716 --> 04:14.287
It's not a party without a little
drama, am I right?

04:14.354 --> 04:16.523
Come on! Turn it up!

04:16.588 --> 04:18.958
Shots on the house.

04:19.025 --> 04:23.229
Call me dumb.
I have a PhD, motherfucker.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.365
- Miss Quinn.
- Romy.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.499
That was my driver.

04:26.565 --> 04:28.134
Oh, whoops.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.170
Well, I'm sure it was his fault.
Consider him fired.

04:30.236 --> 04:31.304
Consider me grateful.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.540
Especially since
I know you don't like me.

04:33.605 --> 04:36.608
I agitate his already delicate
sense of mental equilibrium.

04:36.675 --> 04:38.445
That and
his obsessive-compulsive need

04:38.511 --> 04:39.846
to be
the center of attention.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.549
Will your paramour
be joining us this evening?

04:42.614 --> 04:46.286
Not tonight, Romy.
Not tonight.

04:46.352 --> 04:47.821
Well, enjoy yourself,
Miss Quinn.

04:47.887 --> 04:49.889
And do give
the Joker my best.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.623
<i>Okay, fine, so I hadn't</i>

04:51.690 --> 04:52.758
<i>told people
about the breakup.</i>

04:52.826 --> 04:54.626
<i>But you don't understand.</i>

04:54.693 --> 04:56.196
Find me a new driver.

04:56.262 --> 04:59.499
<i>Being Joker's girl
gave me immunity.</i>

04:59.566 --> 05:03.336
<i>I could do whatever I wanted
to whoever I wanted,</i>

05:03.403 --> 05:06.206
<i>and no one
ever dared to object.</i>

05:19.953 --> 05:21.720
And don't let him
give you shit, okay?

05:21.787 --> 05:24.090
You have to
stick up for yourself.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.944
Oh, please.
I give it a few days

05:45.011 --> 05:46.446
before they're back together.

05:46.513 --> 05:47.881
<i>Even when I did
try and tell people,</i>

05:47.947 --> 05:49.215
<i>they didn't believe me.</i>

05:49.282 --> 05:50.817
Come on.
She told me they're really

05:50.884 --> 05:52.152
broken up this time.

05:52.218 --> 05:54.020
Sure they are, Shell.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.922
That's why she's still wearing
that tacky "J" necklace.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.959
She is going to be running
right back into his arms

06:00.026 --> 06:01.528
the minute
he snaps his fingers.

06:01.594 --> 06:03.695
If not him,
the next closest alpha male

06:03.762 --> 06:04.831
- with a pulse.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.000
Some people
just aren't born

06:07.066 --> 06:08.401
- to stand on their own.
- Oh, girl,

06:08.468 --> 06:09.836
- let's drink. Come on.
- All right.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.171
<i>I knew I needed to find</i>

06:11.237 --> 06:12.839
<i>some way
to show the world</i>

06:12.906 --> 06:15.842
<i>that I'd cut ties
with Mr. J for good.</i>

06:15.909 --> 06:17.110
Harley!

06:19.379 --> 06:22.615
<i>Some people have the Eiffel
Tower, or Olive Garden.</i>

06:22.681 --> 06:23.816
<i>The Joker and I?</i>

06:23.883 --> 06:25.285
<i>Our love bloomed in</i>

06:25.351 --> 06:28.321
<i>a highly toxic
industrial processing plant.</i>

06:34.527 --> 06:35.895
<i>And luckily for me,</i>

06:35.962 --> 06:38.431
<i>I have all
my best ideas drunk.</i>

06:38.498 --> 06:42.001
I have the best idea!

06:49.775 --> 06:53.046
The fuck? Hey! Hey!
Come back here!

07:03.456 --> 07:05.625
This is
where it all began, Puddin'.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.596
You motherfucker!

07:36.089 --> 07:38.524
<i>It was the closure
I needed.</i>

07:38.591 --> 07:39.926
<i>A fresh start.</i>

07:39.993 --> 07:42.061
<i>A chance to be
my own woman.</i>

07:55.174 --> 07:56.775
<i>But I wasn't
the only dame in Gotham</i>

07:56.843 --> 07:58.511
<i>looking for emancipation.</i>

08:00.013 --> 08:02.548
<i>This is our story.</i>

08:04.783 --> 08:06.185
<i>And I'm telling it,</i>

08:06.252 --> 08:07.820
<i>so I'll start
where I fucking want.</i>

08:10.023 --> 08:11.224
<i>Meet the cop.</i>

08:11.291 --> 08:12.959
I got 50
says it was turf war.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.294
<i>Not him.</i>

08:14.360 --> 08:15.828
Well, as always,
you're wrong, Munroe.

08:15.895 --> 08:17.997
<i>Her. Renee Montoya.</i>

08:18.064 --> 08:19.532
<i>Raised on '80s cop shows,</i>

08:19.599 --> 08:21.501
<i>she's always saying
cheesy shit like...</i>

08:21.567 --> 08:23.236
There was only one shooter.

08:23.736 --> 08:25.104
Inside.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.407
This guy shot out the glass.

08:27.473 --> 08:28.508
Serrano.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.376
Yo. Hey.

08:31.544 --> 08:32.945
Have Ballistics
check for a bullet

08:33.012 --> 08:34.747
in one of those parked cars.

08:34.814 --> 08:37.116
<i>Ten years ago,
she broke a career-making case.</i>

08:37.183 --> 08:38.885
- Did I stutter?
- Go ahead.

08:38.951 --> 08:41.688
<i>But her partner at the
time took all the credit.</i>

08:41.754 --> 08:43.523
<i>So while he made captain,</i>

08:43.589 --> 08:45.391
<i>she got stuck at detective
level with this idiot.</i>

08:45.458 --> 08:47.493
Okay, you think one guy
got all four?

08:47.560 --> 08:49.195
Wait, wait, wait.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.797
I'm just saying,
we got four dead bodies here, you know.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.232
- One guy... Bullet holes.
- I'm trying to work.

08:53.299 --> 08:56.035
I'm sorry. Go ahead and work.
Go ahead.

09:00.473 --> 09:03.609
The shooter got close before drawing.
Six rounds.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.511
Two for each of these three.

09:05.578 --> 09:06.913
Yo, mind your debt.

09:06.979 --> 09:08.181
I'm telling you.

09:08.247 --> 09:09.315
That girl, Angelina,
she's a princess.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.783
- Whoa. Hey.
- Look at this.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.352
- Is it Halloween?
- Hey. How you doing?

09:24.130 --> 09:26.466
And it wasn't about them.

09:26.532 --> 09:29.869
It was all about this guy,
right here.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.942
Do you know
who I am?

09:37.076 --> 09:38.945
You fucking bitch.

09:48.187 --> 09:50.890
And this arrow
through his throat...

09:52.860 --> 09:55.161
She wanted him
to die slowly.

09:55.228 --> 09:58.064
- She?
- We got a hair.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.032
And he's got
a new assassin.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.300
Who does?

10:02.268 --> 10:05.271
Roman Beauvais Sionis.

10:05.338 --> 10:08.040
Jesus Christ.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.042
This is Montoya.
What the hell was that?

10:12.145 --> 10:13.546
Shit.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.549
Wow.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.084
- Detective.
- Yep?

10:18.151 --> 10:19.986
Found this necklace.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.656
Holy shit.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.426
Good work, Officer.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.327
What is it?

10:30.430 --> 10:32.598
Harley Quinn and
the Joker broke up.

10:32.665 --> 10:33.834
What?

10:33.901 --> 10:35.401
This was their spot.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.404
She just publicly updated
her relationship status.

10:38.471 --> 10:42.876
Harley Quinn just called
open season on herself.

10:42.942 --> 10:44.510
She did not
think this one through.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.413
<i>Yeah, no shit
I didn't think it through.</i>

10:47.480 --> 10:49.682
<i>I'm about to learn
that a lot of people</i>

10:49.749 --> 10:51.384
<i>in this city want me dead.</i>

10:51.451 --> 10:54.855
<i>And at the top of
that list is this guy.</i>

10:56.289 --> 10:59.992
Mr. Keo and his lovely
wife and daughter.

11:00.059 --> 11:02.161
You kinda forced
my hand here.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.630
Gotta say,
I'm a little disappointed.

11:07.935 --> 11:12.038
I gave you a great pitch.
Didn't I?

11:14.240 --> 11:15.641
And I thought... Shh!

11:17.577 --> 11:19.979
I thought we could build
something beautiful together.

11:20.046 --> 11:21.849
I thought we could
be family.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.630
I'm gonna set you free.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.099
Mmm...

11:41.802 --> 11:45.638
What about her?

11:50.811 --> 11:52.578
I think we can let her go.

11:52.645 --> 11:55.715
I mean, this is a pretty loud
fucking shitshow of a message.

12:00.753 --> 12:03.089
Baby. Aww.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.024
Don't cry.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.795
Thank you.
Thank you.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.030
You're welcome.

12:13.099 --> 12:15.034
Is that a snot bubble?

12:15.101 --> 12:17.403
- Ew. Gross.
- What?

12:17.470 --> 12:20.072
Oh, I've changed my mind.
Peel it off.

12:20.139 --> 12:21.741
No. No!

12:23.709 --> 12:25.378
<i>The wack
job with the penchant</i>

12:25.444 --> 12:28.514
<i>for peeling faces
is Roman Sionis,</i>

12:28.581 --> 12:29.682
<i>aka</i>

12:29.749 --> 12:31.551
<i>Black Mask.</i>

12:34.387 --> 12:37.757
<i>The fact that he wants me
dead hasn't yet hit my radar.</i>

12:37.824 --> 12:40.660
<i>See, I was halfway across town,</i>

12:40.726 --> 12:44.263
<i>hungover,
and thinking about breakfast.</i>

12:46.198 --> 12:51.370
<i>Egg, bacon,
American cheese.</i>

12:51.437 --> 12:55.741
<i>Soft, toasted buttered roll.</i>

12:55.809 --> 12:58.644
<i>Just a dash
of hot sauce.</i>

12:58.711 --> 13:00.079
Not too much, Sal.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.315
I wanna taste the cheese.

13:02.381 --> 13:05.251
<i>What a way to
start my new life.</i>

13:06.652 --> 13:10.824
<i>With the perfect
egg sandwich.</i>

13:11.524 --> 13:12.558
Mmm!

13:13.827 --> 13:15.661
You're a lifesaver, Sal.

13:17.730 --> 13:21.634
And I'm good for the 75 cents, okay?
I promise.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.437
That's all the money
I got in the world,

13:24.503 --> 13:26.405
and it's so worth it.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.578
<i>I don't know if it's
the stray Armenian arm hair,</i>

13:32.645 --> 13:34.313
<i>or the fact that
his cheese slices</i>

13:34.380 --> 13:36.215
<i>are always six months
out of date,</i>

13:36.282 --> 13:40.020
<i>but no one makes
an egg sandwich like Sal.</i>

13:40.087 --> 13:42.254
I mean it, Sal.
No one.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.605
Freeze! Gotham PD.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.843
<i>Yeah, I don't think so.</i>

14:02.909 --> 14:04.310
Are you fucking kidding me?

14:08.048 --> 14:10.316
Yo! Police.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.451
<i>It had
been six short hours</i>

14:12.518 --> 14:14.253
<i>since my little stunt
at Ace Chemicals</i>

14:14.320 --> 14:15.621
<i>announced to the world</i>

14:15.688 --> 14:18.457
<i>that Mr. J and I
were dunzo.</i>

14:18.524 --> 14:23.195
<i>The immunity I'd enjoyed
for so long was gone.</i>

14:23.262 --> 14:26.066
<i>Cops who never would've
dared come after me before</i>

14:26.133 --> 14:28.035
<i>were suddenly doing this.</i>

14:34.041 --> 14:35.909
Ooh!

14:35.976 --> 14:37.243
Freeze!

14:37.309 --> 14:38.879
- <i>And what's worse?</i>
- Move!

14:38.945 --> 14:40.713
<i>Every person I ever
wronged now felt free</i>

14:40.780 --> 14:42.949
<i>to come and
take their pound of flesh.</i>

14:59.900 --> 15:02.702
<i>Turns out I wronged
a lot of people.</i>

15:04.637 --> 15:07.440
Come on, boy. Get him!

15:08.875 --> 15:09.876
Oh...

15:24.757 --> 15:25.892
Finally.

15:35.301 --> 15:36.669
<i>And then...</i>

15:36.736 --> 15:37.904
We're gonna
get through this, okay?

15:37.971 --> 15:39.472
<i>...tragedy struck.</i>

15:49.983 --> 15:53.887
<i>It took losing
something I truly love</i>

15:53.954 --> 15:56.857
<i>for me to see that
the target on my back</i>

15:56.923 --> 15:58.457
<i>was bigger
than I thought.</i>

16:00.259 --> 16:01.761
Freeze.

16:01.828 --> 16:04.164
<i>With the walls
closing in around me,</i>

16:04.231 --> 16:05.731
<i>I made a carefully calculated,</i>

16:05.798 --> 16:08.300
<i>highly strategic move.</i>

16:16.742 --> 16:20.147
<i>Fine. It was dumb luck.
But still...</i>

16:20.213 --> 16:21.580
That felt pretty great.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.552
Sorry for busting in
on you like that,

16:26.619 --> 16:28.021
but thanks
for the shortcut.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.522
See ya. Oh!

16:30.157 --> 16:31.925
There she is.

16:31.992 --> 16:32.993
Harley Quinn.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.494
Yeah?

16:35.561 --> 16:37.296
I've waited
a long time for this.

16:37.730 --> 16:38.999
You have?

16:39.431 --> 16:40.967
Oh...

16:41.034 --> 16:42.869
I haven't had breakfast yet.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.839
What did I do to you?

16:45.906 --> 16:47.473
Are you serious?

16:48.541 --> 16:50.043
Look at my face.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.412
Look at my face!

16:59.385 --> 17:00.586
Oh...

17:02.222 --> 17:03.489
That wasn't me.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.491
But you dared him
to do it.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.393
Yeah, but I dare
a lot of people

17:07.459 --> 17:08.995
to do a lot of things, okay? Come on.
I'm not even with him anymore.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.063
I know.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.866
That means

17:12.933 --> 17:14.968
there's no one here
to stop me.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.104
- Right.
- You're gonna die, Quinn.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.405
Ooh. A penny.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.413
They're shooting arrows now?

17:37.790 --> 17:38.959
Ah, crap.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.492
Him, too?

17:50.536 --> 17:51.737
Parley?

17:55.242 --> 17:58.477
Fuck, Montoya,
you smell like a dead rat's asshole.

17:58.544 --> 17:59.980
Not today, Simpson.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.282
Hey, it's Detective Montoya.
Respect your elders.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.383
I mean, your elderly.

18:04.450 --> 18:05.718
You're only a few years
younger than me,

18:05.784 --> 18:07.053
and you're still
behind that desk.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.454
You wanna go there?

18:08.520 --> 18:10.489
Come on. Empty your pockets.
All of it.

18:10.556 --> 18:12.826
Cassandra Cain,
back already?

18:12.893 --> 18:16.096
Thought by now you'd figure
out how not to get caught.

18:17.496 --> 18:18.832
What? No comeback?

18:22.369 --> 18:23.769
You all right?

18:25.071 --> 18:26.705
You smell like shit.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.543
Yo, Simpson.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.880
Any clean clothes
in lost and found?

18:36.049 --> 18:39.986
These are serious accusations,
Miss Montoya.

18:40.053 --> 18:41.888
The Sionis family name
is on

18:41.955 --> 18:43.555
half the museums and
schools in Gotham.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.992
And that makes him
immune to the law, Captain?

18:46.059 --> 18:49.728
<i>Montoya's day is
going almost as badly as mine.</i>

18:49.795 --> 18:52.132
<i>Remember the guy
who stole her promotion?</i>

18:52.198 --> 18:53.432
<i>That's him.</i>

18:53.499 --> 18:55.467
He had four people killed
alone last night.

18:55.534 --> 18:57.270
If Roman Sionis is
such a mastermind,

18:57.337 --> 18:59.538
how'd he get fired
from his own fucking company?

18:59.605 --> 19:00.807
The Janus Corporation is

19:00.874 --> 19:02.574
his father's company,
thank you.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.878
And by the way,
they cut him off.

19:04.945 --> 19:07.546
Where does the DA's office
stand on all this?

19:07.613 --> 19:08.915
<i>To make
matters worse,</i>

19:08.982 --> 19:10.749
<i>the assistant DA?
That's her ex.</i>

19:10.817 --> 19:13.253
The evidence that Sionis is
linked to these murders...

19:13.320 --> 19:15.255
There's a shipment
coming in.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.488
Drugs?

19:16.555 --> 19:18.124
- A diamond.
- A diamond.

19:18.191 --> 19:19.826
Wow, Montoya.
Should we call the Feds for backup?

19:19.893 --> 19:22.162
Listen,
I had a source at the club.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.830
His driver.

19:23.897 --> 19:25.398
He said that Roman couldn't
stop talking about this thing.

19:25.464 --> 19:26.632
And he said that
he overheard

19:26.699 --> 19:27.733
something about
laser-encoding.

19:27.801 --> 19:29.169
Now, I did some research.

19:29.235 --> 19:31.905
I think
it's the Bertinelli diamond.

19:31.972 --> 19:34.707
You remember the Bertinelli
massacre, right?

19:34.773 --> 19:36.209
<i>Quick history lesson.</i>

19:36.276 --> 19:38.044
<i>Fifteen years ago,
one of the wealthiest</i>

19:38.111 --> 19:40.847
<i>Mafia families in Gotham
was gunned down.</i>

19:40.914 --> 19:43.549
<i>It was a power grab,
but the real target</i>

19:43.615 --> 19:45.684
<i>was the Bertinellis'
super-secret</i>

19:45.751 --> 19:48.054
<i>offshore bank accounts,</i>

19:48.121 --> 19:49.755
<i>the details of which
were said to be encoded</i>

19:49.823 --> 19:53.460
<i>in the atomic structure
of a 30-carat diamond.</i>

19:53.525 --> 19:55.161
<i>The rock was lost.</i>

19:55.228 --> 19:58.564
<i>And with it, the only key
to the Bertinelli fortune.</i>

19:58.630 --> 20:00.566
Which is exactly
why Roman Sionis

20:00.632 --> 20:03.203
is trying to
get his hands on it.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.305
That's what makes him
so dangerous.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.107
He's already
building an army.

20:07.173 --> 20:08.208
If he gets the diamond,

20:08.274 --> 20:09.843
he'll have all the money
and connections

20:09.909 --> 20:12.045
to bribe every single
judge and cop

20:12.112 --> 20:14.180
he needs to get a
monopoly on the city.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.216
You said you had
someone on the inside?

20:16.282 --> 20:19.886
Yes. He's...

20:19.953 --> 20:21.087
He's no longer
there, but...

20:21.154 --> 20:23.323
So basically,
you have nothing.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.358
You are trying to go after

20:25.425 --> 20:28.228
one of the most litigious and
wealthiest families in Gotham,

20:28.294 --> 20:30.529
and all you've got is
rumors and a hunch?

20:30.596 --> 20:32.165
Well, you know,

20:32.232 --> 20:34.533
the DA's office is building
a case against him, too.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.935
Isn't that right,
Miss Yee?

20:36.002 --> 20:37.904
Listen, if the DA
is willing to throw himself

20:37.971 --> 20:40.672
out in front of this,
it's fine with me.

20:40.739 --> 20:41.841
Captain, no.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.709
Listen, Munroe, find me

20:43.776 --> 20:46.146
some tangible connection
to Sionis, all right?

20:46.212 --> 20:48.448
- Yes, sir.
- Wait, wait, wait. Captain.

20:48.515 --> 20:49.782
This is my case, okay?

20:49.849 --> 20:51.550
I've been working on this
for six months.

20:51.617 --> 20:56.222
We need something that we
can actually use, Detective.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.158
And, Miss Montoya,
we do have a dress code.

21:02.062 --> 21:04.230
- Look, I'm sorry about that, but I...
- No.

21:04.297 --> 21:05.899
That is my job
you are fucking with.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.633
What is wrong
with you, Renee?

21:07.699 --> 21:09.402
Me?
He gave my case away.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.004
Oh, poor Renee.

21:11.071 --> 21:12.439
Why don't you pour yourself a drink?
It's almost noon.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.506
Wow.

21:16.342 --> 21:19.245
Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?

21:19.312 --> 21:21.181
<i>Why the fuck haven't you</i>

21:21.247 --> 21:22.482
<i>been picking up your phone?
We've got a situation.</i>

21:22.549 --> 21:23.883
What... What situation?

21:23.950 --> 21:25.318
<i>You didn't hear this
from me,</i>

21:25.385 --> 21:27.420
but you gotta find her
before someone else does.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.923
She's got the diamond, and trust
me, Roman will kill her.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.590
My diamond? Who?
Who's got it?

21:31.657 --> 21:33.059
<i>This kid.</i>

21:33.126 --> 21:36.062
She's a pickpocket.
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.064
Holy fuck.

21:48.607 --> 21:50.043
Can I help you?

21:50.110 --> 21:51.478
Why, yes.
Yes, you can.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.645
I'm here to
report a terrible crime.

21:55.115 --> 21:57.350
And what terrible crime
is that?

21:59.685 --> 22:00.987
This one.

22:18.371 --> 22:19.606
Hi, boys.

22:24.710 --> 22:25.812
Meeting's over.

23:24.604 --> 23:26.772
Run, piggy, run.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.416
Where can I find
Cassandra Cain?

23:38.418 --> 23:40.987
<i>Hold up, hold up.
I'm telling this all wrong.</i>

23:41.054 --> 23:42.655
<i>Let's rewind.</i>

23:42.721 --> 23:44.324
<i>For you to understand
why me,</i>

23:44.390 --> 23:45.892
<i>the cop,
and that dame on the toilet...</i>

23:45.959 --> 23:47.327
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

23:47.393 --> 23:49.929
<i>...are all looking for
this Cain character...</i>

23:49.996 --> 23:52.565
<i>I gotta take you back
a few days,</i>

23:52.632 --> 23:56.135

I'm talking you and me
having each other's backs.

24:35.742 --> 24:37.176
The Golden Lions can't just

24:37.243 --> 24:39.412
wander into
Gotham National Bank.

24:39.479 --> 24:40.880
I can.

24:40.947 --> 24:43.383
Loans, liquidity, laundering.

24:43.449 --> 24:46.452
Look, if you bring your boys
into the fold,

24:46.519 --> 24:49.956
there are no limits to what
we could achieve together.

24:50.023 --> 24:53.126
I'm building
something special.

24:53.192 --> 24:55.794
I appreciate your offer,
Mr. Sionis.

24:55.862 --> 24:59.032
But with all due respect,

24:59.098 --> 25:01.401
the Golden Lions
are a family business.

25:01.467 --> 25:04.971
Fuck family.
All due respect, but fuck that.

25:05.038 --> 25:06.406
Family's a fucking illusion.

25:06.472 --> 25:08.875
You know what my family gave me?
Nothing.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.510
I know what everyone says.

25:10.576 --> 25:12.211
"Here comes Roman Sionis.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.414
He was handed life
on a silver spoon."

25:14.480 --> 25:16.482
"Gin and tonics at 5:00."
"I'll have the duck."

25:16.549 --> 25:19.719
Blah, blah, blah.
Fake fucking fucks.

25:20.987 --> 25:23.423
But look at me now.

25:23.489 --> 25:26.192
I've located
the Bertinelli diamond.

25:26.259 --> 25:28.061
I'm about to own this city.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.996
Not just the East End.

25:30.063 --> 25:31.964
I am thinking big, baby.

25:32.031 --> 25:35.034
And I want you there with me.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.236
We could make
our own family.

25:37.303 --> 25:38.204
Mr. Sionis,

25:38.271 --> 25:39.739
the Golden Lions
have operated

25:39.807 --> 25:41.507
in Gotham
for nearly 100 years.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.878
We have no need
of your protection.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.381
<i>He's gonna
regret that.</i>

25:56.689 --> 25:59.325
Will you sleep on it?
Will you do that for me?

25:59.392 --> 26:01.294
Run it by that
beautiful wife of yours,

26:01.361 --> 26:03.730
and I'll come see you at the

<i>Canary's been singing
at Roman's club for years.</i>

27:04.424 --> 27:05.658
Come on!

27:05.725 --> 27:07.160
<i>He calls
her his little bird,</i>

27:07.226 --> 27:08.694
<i>and he's got her wrapped</i>

27:08.761 --> 27:11.197
<i>right around
his fancy little finger.</i>

27:16.102 --> 27:17.437
Here you go, Canary.

27:17.503 --> 27:18.604
Thank you.

27:19.873 --> 27:22.575
How do you spell "mercenary"?

27:23.509 --> 27:24.977
Merceninny...

27:26.045 --> 27:27.246
Merceran?

27:33.986 --> 27:36.355
Singer lady woman!

27:36.422 --> 27:39.358
You're really, really good.

27:39.425 --> 27:40.426
Yeah.

27:46.299 --> 27:48.734
Know what a harlequin is?

27:50.670 --> 27:53.673
Janky-ass clown
with bad eye makeup?

27:53.739 --> 27:55.074
Oof!

27:55.608 --> 27:57.109
Ouch!

28:00.613 --> 28:03.049
A harlequin's role

28:04.150 --> 28:06.185
is to serve.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.454
An audience.

28:08.956 --> 28:11.090
A master.

28:13.559 --> 28:17.029
You know, a harlequin's
nothing without a master.

28:18.832 --> 28:23.769
And no one gives two fucks
who we are beyond that.

28:32.512 --> 28:34.547
Yeah, I don't know who
you think I am, lady,

28:34.614 --> 28:35.615
but I'm not her.

28:38.251 --> 28:40.319
Puddin' and I broke up.

28:47.493 --> 28:50.129
I haven't told that
to anyone.

28:51.531 --> 28:53.566
Yeah.

28:53.633 --> 28:55.401
For good this time.

28:57.103 --> 29:00.706
And for the first time
in a long time,

29:01.975 --> 29:04.243
I'm all on my lonesome.

29:08.849 --> 29:10.416
It's great.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.555
Welcome to the club.

29:16.789 --> 29:18.391
Thanks.

29:18.457 --> 29:22.628
Hey, don't be lonesome.
How about another drink?

29:22.695 --> 29:24.297
- Yes!
- Yeah?

29:24.363 --> 29:25.933
- Yeah.
- It's on me.

29:25.999 --> 29:28.200
- Sure. Drinks!
- Hey, two shots.

29:31.504 --> 29:33.205
Hey.

29:42.415 --> 29:44.750
We're all good here.

29:57.697 --> 30:00.366
- I don't wanna go home.
- Oh, no? No.

30:00.433 --> 30:02.201
No.

30:03.804 --> 30:06.405
Let me know
if you're gonna get sick.

30:06.472 --> 30:09.208
Your chariot's arrived.
Oh, there you go.

30:09.275 --> 30:10.509
Are we getting breakfast?

30:10.576 --> 30:12.211
Hey, buddy,
I'm gonna need some help.

30:12.278 --> 30:13.914
This is my friend.

30:13.981 --> 30:15.381
I told you all about...

30:15.448 --> 30:16.582
Hey, get the door, man.
I got her, I got her.

30:16.649 --> 30:18.618
- There we go.
- Wait.

30:19.418 --> 30:20.786
Isn't that Joker's girl?

30:20.854 --> 30:21.922
Not anymore.

30:21.989 --> 30:23.155
Got room
for one more?

30:23.222 --> 30:24.423
Hey.

30:25.291 --> 30:26.726
Huh?

30:29.462 --> 30:33.165
I don't need your help.
I got this.

30:33.232 --> 30:35.768
You got this?
You sure about that?

30:35.836 --> 30:37.838
Yeah, no wonder
everyone hates you.

30:41.140 --> 30:43.209
Uh...

30:53.185 --> 30:54.387
You got this!

30:55.989 --> 30:58.391
You motherfucker!

31:00.226 --> 31:01.862
Whoo!

31:05.132 --> 31:08.334
Well, well, well,
well, well, well.

31:08.401 --> 31:11.537
Could that be
our little Miss Lance?

31:11.604 --> 31:13.339
All these years,
I thought she was just

31:13.406 --> 31:15.842
a pretty face
and a fine set of lungs.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.278
Ooh.

31:19.345 --> 31:24.151
Mr. Zsasz,
I've had an amazing idea.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.626
That's my little bird.

31:36.429 --> 31:40.100
Don't touch what you can't
afford, mister.

31:40.167 --> 31:41.367
Shut up.

31:43.136 --> 31:46.305
Oh, songbird.

31:46.372 --> 31:48.474
You drive
as good as you fight?

31:51.078 --> 31:52.578
Who's asking?

31:52.645 --> 31:54.213
The boss.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.949
You're getting promoted.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.519
You're his new driver.

32:00.586 --> 32:03.123
Huh. Thanks,
but I think I'm good

32:03.190 --> 32:04.390
with the singing gig.

32:04.457 --> 32:06.459
You'll be good
at the driving gig.

32:07.493 --> 32:11.697
Be here tomorrow.
9:00 a.m. Sharp.

32:11.764 --> 32:14.366
<i>So,
that's how Canary got herself a job</i>

32:14.433 --> 32:17.336
<i>driving around
Gotham's newest Godfather.</i>

32:17.403 --> 32:20.639
<i>A position, I might add,
that wouldn't have been vacant</i>

32:20.706 --> 32:23.542
<i>without the help
of yours truly.</i>

32:30.884 --> 32:31.684
Morning.

32:42.896 --> 32:44.697
You're
the one who wanted the kid!

32:44.764 --> 32:46.465
I never wanted her!

32:48.969 --> 32:50.636
Let me guess. Parents?

32:51.337 --> 32:52.638
Foster parents.

32:52.705 --> 32:53.706
Right.

32:54.774 --> 32:56.609
Sorry, kid.

32:56.675 --> 32:59.411
Sorry about your face.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.915
Shit, you do have something
on your face.

33:01.982 --> 33:05.384
You should've seen
the other guy.

33:08.021 --> 33:09.622
Uh...

33:09.688 --> 33:10.790
I want

33:10.857 --> 33:12.658
that kid out of
my fucking house!

33:12.725 --> 33:15.427
You know, kid,
not every day is gonna be like this.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.663
You just gotta
hang in there.

33:23.636 --> 33:25.404
Get something to eat.

33:26.873 --> 33:29.642
Stay outta that.
It's not worth it.

33:38.251 --> 33:39.718
Don't
talk to me like that.

33:42.755 --> 33:44.390
<i>Canary spends the next week</i>

33:44.456 --> 33:47.894
<i>settling in to her new job
as Roman's personal driver.</i>

33:57.037 --> 33:58.671
Ew. Okay.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.106
<i>What she didn't know</i>

34:00.173 --> 34:01.808
<i>is that driving
Mr. Face-peely-pants</i>

34:01.875 --> 34:04.343
<i>was gonna put her
right in the crosshairs</i>

34:04.410 --> 34:06.847
<i>of my favorite little piggy.</i>

34:07.546 --> 34:08.647
Dinah Lance?

34:08.714 --> 34:09.983
Who the hell are you?

34:10.050 --> 34:13.652
I'm Renee Montoya,
detective with GCPD.

34:16.022 --> 34:20.093
Your predecessor
and I had an arrangement.

34:20.160 --> 34:21.594
Oh, really?

34:21.660 --> 34:22.863
He told me
that there was

34:22.929 --> 34:26.099
a shipment coming in.
A diamond.

34:26.166 --> 34:29.236
A very special diamond.

34:29.302 --> 34:32.638
Yeah, not interested, lady.
Thanks for the coffee.

34:34.506 --> 34:36.843
Do you know
who you're working for?

34:36.910 --> 34:38.477
You're damn right, I do.
He's the man who

34:38.544 --> 34:40.512
gave me a job.
Took me off the streets.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.382
Yeah, well, he's also
a very dangerous man.

34:43.449 --> 34:46.253
A criminal. A murderer.

34:46.319 --> 34:47.586
What would
your mother think of

34:47.653 --> 34:49.722
you working for
a guy like that, huh?

34:49.788 --> 34:51.992
You have
the same power she had.

34:52.058 --> 34:53.860
Don't you think she
would want you to use it?

34:53.927 --> 34:55.794
The hell do you know
about my mother?

34:55.862 --> 34:58.899
Back in the day,
she used to help the GCPD.

34:58.965 --> 35:01.567
- She was a good woman.
- Yeah.

35:01.634 --> 35:04.037
She was
a damn good woman.

35:04.104 --> 35:05.504
The kind of woman

35:05.571 --> 35:07.974
who put everyone else's lives
before her own.

35:08.041 --> 35:10.743
And when she was found
dead in the street,

35:10.810 --> 35:14.881
where the fuck were you
and your boys in blue then?

35:14.948 --> 35:16.883
Now you wanna come
and knock on my door

35:16.950 --> 35:18.852
and ask me
to help you out

35:18.919 --> 35:21.054
and make the same
mistake she did?

35:22.822 --> 35:25.724
Yeah.
Good luck with that.

35:27.127 --> 35:28.895
That's fair enough.

35:28.962 --> 35:31.031
And I'm sorry
for your loss.

35:32.365 --> 35:34.733
For the record,

35:34.801 --> 35:38.204
that would never happen
on my watch.

35:40.773 --> 35:43.442
The Sprang Bridge
Soldiers capituated.

35:43.509 --> 35:45.946
"Capitulated."
Of course they did.

35:46.012 --> 35:48.447
I told you that Keo scene
would send a message.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.517
It sure did, boss.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.485
It sure fucking did.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.989
Crossbow Killer

35:57.057 --> 35:59.192
struck again last night.

35:59.259 --> 36:00.860
Rossi and four of his guys.

36:00.927 --> 36:03.863
People don't kill people I
own without my permission.

36:03.930 --> 36:05.865
Why doesn't this crossbow guy
know that?

36:05.932 --> 36:07.566
- You know that!
- I know it.

36:07.633 --> 36:08.767
Why doesn't this crossbow guy?

36:08.835 --> 36:10.669
Why don't I own
the crossbow guy?

36:10.736 --> 36:13.807
- You should own him.
- I mean, I like crossbows.

36:13.873 --> 36:15.875
Oh, good morning.
Good morning.

36:15.942 --> 36:17.543
- Morning.
- Come in. Come in.

36:17.609 --> 36:20.447
We're just finishing up a little business.
Look around.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.349
- You're late.
- It's fine.

36:22.415 --> 36:24.516
Should she come back another
time, 'cause she's late?

36:24.583 --> 36:26.652
No. Isn't this stunning?

36:28.288 --> 36:31.523
That is a Chokwe mask.

36:31.590 --> 36:34.626
I got it when I was embedded
with the Mbangani tribe

36:34.693 --> 36:36.762
in Congo-Kinshasa.
Have you ever been?

36:36.830 --> 36:37.897
- I've never been.
- Mmm.

36:37.964 --> 36:39.232
I've heard it's beautiful.

36:39.299 --> 36:40.900
- It's dirty.
- Oh...

36:40.967 --> 36:45.105
Here, look at this.
Genuine tsantsa or shrunken head.

36:45.171 --> 36:46.572
Shuar of Ecuador.

36:46.638 --> 36:48.108
They're amazing people.
Surprisingly gentle.

36:48.174 --> 36:50.176
- I think you might like them.
- Really?

36:50.243 --> 36:52.578
Mmm. They boil the
heads of their enemies

36:52.644 --> 36:54.513
and they make
these little fellas.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.216
- Exquisite, aren't they? Look.
- Mmm-hmm.

36:56.282 --> 36:59.651
Look at those little ears.
And his little haircut.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.421
- Yeah, he's 1,000 years old.
- Wow.

37:01.488 --> 37:03.456
And now he's just an
ornament in my living room.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.624
- Ew! I love it.
- Yeah?

37:05.691 --> 37:07.293
These are
ancient acupuncture models.

37:07.360 --> 37:10.030
As you can see,
they have all the acupuncture points.

37:10.096 --> 37:13.166
And we found these
buried in the mountains.

37:13.233 --> 37:16.436
Ace Chemicals got blown
sky high last night.

37:16.503 --> 37:17.871
All right, all right,

37:17.937 --> 37:20.140
let's find the Crossbow Killer.
I get it.

37:20.206 --> 37:22.042
Is he an acupuncture model,
too?

37:22.108 --> 37:23.776
He is not
an acupuncture model.

37:23.843 --> 37:25.345
This is a statue of me.

37:25.412 --> 37:27.013
It was made by a very
famous Gotham artist...

37:27.080 --> 37:29.782
Harley Quinn
did it.

37:29.849 --> 37:32.252
Some kind of "fuck you"
to the Joker.

37:32.785 --> 37:34.054
They split.

37:35.121 --> 37:37.689
What's wrong with you,
Victor?

37:37.756 --> 37:40.827
- Talk about burying the lede.
- Yeah.

37:40.894 --> 37:43.863
This is spectacular news!

37:43.930 --> 37:46.332
She doesn't belong to him,
she belongs to me.

37:46.399 --> 37:47.867
Have the boys
go find her.

37:47.934 --> 37:49.768
Round her up, bring her back.
I want her.

37:49.836 --> 37:51.805
You, I have something
I want you to pick me up.

37:51.871 --> 37:54.340
Something super-duper
important, okay?

37:54.407 --> 37:55.741
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.

37:55.809 --> 37:57.609
- Yeah, go with Victor.
- It's just a pickup.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.212
No, he's harmless.

37:59.279 --> 38:01.548
Do as you're told. Go.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.464
All right.
We can go.

38:17.530 --> 38:18.865
I'll take that.

38:18.932 --> 38:20.467
Mr. S said for me
to hold on to it.

38:20.533 --> 38:22.368
Go get your car.

38:24.370 --> 38:28.041
<i>That rock.
That rock's about to become the key</i>

38:28.108 --> 38:29.608
<i>to whether or not
I live to</i>

38:29.675 --> 38:31.878
<i>enjoy my newfound
independence.</i>

38:35.515 --> 38:36.816
Get off me.

38:36.883 --> 38:38.318
What the hell
are you doing here?

38:38.384 --> 38:40.053
You're not the only one
who makes money

38:40.120 --> 38:42.322
off of dumb, rich,
white people.

38:42.388 --> 38:43.890
Well, you know what?

38:43.957 --> 38:45.657
One day you're gonna pick
the wrong pocket, sis.

38:45.724 --> 38:48.027
Okay. Whatever.

38:50.864 --> 38:52.599
Dumb-ass kids.

38:54.801 --> 38:56.569
Excuse me. Sorry.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.214
I really like your earrings.

39:08.281 --> 39:09.781
Why, thank you.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.685
There's the thief.
There's the thief.

39:16.089 --> 39:17.223
Get off of me!

39:17.290 --> 39:19.926
That little girl
took my watch.

39:19.993 --> 39:21.928
I didn't do nothing.

39:24.564 --> 39:25.632
Where the fuck's
the diamond?

39:25.697 --> 39:27.300
I just fucking had it.

39:27.766 --> 39:29.202
Cass!

39:31.404 --> 39:32.505
Wait!

39:32.572 --> 39:33.940
Wait, wait!

39:35.408 --> 39:36.643
Halt!

39:36.708 --> 39:38.744
Fuck!

39:58.131 --> 39:59.798
<i>In the
storytelling business,</i>

39:59.866 --> 40:03.036
<i>this dummy
swallowing that diamond</i>

40:03.102 --> 40:06.839
<i>is called a complication.</i>

40:06.906 --> 40:10.742
<i>A complication I didn't
exactly need right now.</i>

40:13.546 --> 40:14.746
Parley?

40:17.850 --> 40:20.019
We lost the diamond.

40:20.086 --> 40:21.187
What?

40:21.254 --> 40:22.889
We're really sorry, Mr. S.
This kid...

40:22.956 --> 40:25.258
We never even
got our hands on it.

40:26.593 --> 40:27.793
Ow!

40:28.628 --> 40:30.729
Help!

40:30.796 --> 40:32.798
Get out!
Get out of here!

40:32.865 --> 40:35.001
You, too! Go!
With your fucking sage

40:35.068 --> 40:37.470
stinking my place up.
Fuck off!

40:37.537 --> 40:39.172
Here she is.

40:39.239 --> 40:40.240
She's a child!

40:40.306 --> 40:41.507
- Mr. Sionis.
- She's just a kid.

40:41.574 --> 40:43.142
She's... What?

40:43.209 --> 40:44.978
We have Harley Quinn
downstairs, as requested.

40:45.044 --> 40:46.346
Fuck off! Get out.

40:46.412 --> 40:48.047
Fucking out!

40:48.114 --> 40:49.816
Fuck!
These are my things.

40:49.882 --> 40:51.517
- This diamond is my things.
- Yes.

40:51.584 --> 40:53.052
My things!

40:53.119 --> 40:54.854
Fucking fuck!
I don't ask for much, do I?

40:54.921 --> 40:56.589
- No.
- Why is this happening to me?

40:56.656 --> 40:57.857
Why?

40:59.359 --> 41:01.361
I'm gonna get
your diamond back.

41:02.462 --> 41:03.963
I promise.

41:04.030 --> 41:09.068
Why don't we go downstairs
and kill that Harley bitch?

41:10.436 --> 41:12.572
Blow off a little steam.

41:12.639 --> 41:15.541
Yeah, I have wanted to do
that for quite some time.

41:17.310 --> 41:20.179
Okay.
I'll go get changed.

41:35.495 --> 41:37.130
Shit, Cass.

41:42.001 --> 41:45.538
I don't care what it
takes, I want my diamond back.

41:45.605 --> 41:47.907
We're working on it.

41:47.974 --> 41:50.810
Now, let's go have a little fun.

41:55.615 --> 42:00.520
Harleen Quinzel.

42:00.586 --> 42:01.587
Whoo!

42:02.989 --> 42:04.324
Hiya, Romy.

42:05.525 --> 42:08.094
Do you know why you're here?
Hmm?

42:08.161 --> 42:09.862
<i>When it comes to
me and Roman Sionis,</i>

42:09.929 --> 42:12.732
<i>there are a lot of possible
answers to this question.</i>

42:12.799 --> 42:14.300
<i>Breaking his driver's legs.</i>

42:14.367 --> 42:16.369
<i>There's that time
I called it an "expresso."</i>

42:16.436 --> 42:17.970
<i>Having a vagina in the first
place pisses this guy off.</i>

42:22.342 --> 42:25.111
<i>Constantly interrupting him,
like I'm doing right now.</i>

42:25.178 --> 42:27.413
- You're here because...
- Oh, God, stop.

42:27.480 --> 42:29.749
You're gonna do that
thing where you open up

42:29.817 --> 42:31.317
a weird-ass case
of torture devices

42:31.384 --> 42:33.886
while inexplicably
detailing your master plan

42:33.953 --> 42:35.221
and how
I don't fit into it.

42:35.288 --> 42:36.656
I'm building a better...

42:36.723 --> 42:38.257
Seriously, you don't have to.
Really!

42:38.324 --> 42:39.792
You're building
a criminal empire

42:39.859 --> 42:41.694
because Daddy kicked
you out of Janus Corp.

42:41.761 --> 42:43.496
And you think this is a big
"fuck you," but in actuality

42:43.563 --> 42:45.331
it's a very misguided attempt
to win back his respect.

42:45.398 --> 42:48.534
I get it. You're really not
as complicated as you think.

42:48.601 --> 42:50.603
And you're really not as
clever as you think, because

42:50.670 --> 42:52.972
- now I'm gonna slice your...
- Oh, Jesus Christmas.

42:53.039 --> 42:55.174
Now you're gonna say
that you wanna kill me

42:55.241 --> 42:57.143
to set an example.
Christ, you're boring.

42:57.210 --> 42:59.912
- I wanna kill you...
- Shit.

42:59.979 --> 43:02.281
...because without
the Joker around,

43:03.817 --> 43:05.418
I can.

43:08.287 --> 43:11.391
For all your noise
and bluster,

43:11.457 --> 43:12.860
you're just
a silly little girl

43:12.925 --> 43:14.927
with no one around
to protect her.

43:19.766 --> 43:21.267
- Whoa. Wait.
- What?

43:21.334 --> 43:22.870
- Don't kill me.
- Ha! Right.

43:22.935 --> 43:24.637
No, no, no. Seriously. Romy, Roman.

43:24.704 --> 43:26.539
Come on. There's gotta be something,

43:26.606 --> 43:29.108
something we can figure out. Hey!

43:29.175 --> 43:31.377
Wait, wait!
You lost something, right?

43:31.444 --> 43:32.945
You lost something.
I heard you say it.

43:33.012 --> 43:34.213
A diamond.

43:39.719 --> 43:41.053
Yeah.

43:42.188 --> 43:44.390
I can help you
find it.

43:44.457 --> 43:47.593
Seriously.
Look in my pocket.

43:50.730 --> 43:52.165
Other pocket.

44:01.174 --> 44:03.109
I'm starting up
my own business.

44:03.176 --> 44:04.644
See what it says?
Second from the bottom.

44:09.048 --> 44:11.885
I know the East End
better than anybody.

44:11.951 --> 44:15.121
You want this diamond back?
I'm your gal.

44:15.188 --> 44:17.390
Mr. J once lost
a rare photograph

44:17.457 --> 44:18.892
of a nude
Eleanor Roosevelt,

44:18.958 --> 44:21.093
and I found it in a bird's
nest in Robinson Park.

44:21.160 --> 44:23.296
If you let me go,

44:23.362 --> 44:27.300
just for now,
I'll get you that rock back.

44:27.366 --> 44:29.502
What have you got to lose?
If your boys find it first,

44:29.569 --> 44:31.437
swear to God,
you can kill me later.

44:31.504 --> 44:34.106
Pinky swear.
Cross my heart, hope to fart.

44:34.173 --> 44:35.641
You're so tiresome!

44:37.143 --> 44:38.778
If you want my mercy,

44:38.846 --> 44:42.315
shut that hole in the middle
of your face and listen.

44:42.381 --> 44:45.218
You're gonna
get me my diamond.

Let's make it
half a mil.

46:03.596 --> 46:05.731
It's more fun
if she's got competition.

46:05.798 --> 46:08.969
Send it to every
mercenary in Gotham.

46:09.036 --> 46:11.304
Oh, hey, you're that
singer no one listens to.

46:11.370 --> 46:13.739
Hey, you're the asshole
no one likes.

46:31.390 --> 46:34.193
Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?

46:34.260 --> 46:35.494
<i>We've got a situation.</i>

46:35.561 --> 46:37.064
<i>This kid,
she's got the diamond.</i>

46:37.129 --> 46:39.032
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

46:39.098 --> 46:40.399
Holy fuck.

46:44.004 --> 46:45.638
Where can I find
Cassandra Cain?

46:45.705 --> 46:47.740
<i>Okay.
Now we're good.</i>

46:51.344 --> 46:52.545
Cell seven.

46:57.550 --> 46:59.886
Thanks, doll.
You're a peach.

Hmm. Perfect.

47:53.506 --> 47:54.908
Hold up,
hold up.

47:54.975 --> 47:56.575
- Remember me?
- She stole my car!

47:56.642 --> 47:58.210
- Harley Quinn.
- Hey, Quinn!

47:58.277 --> 47:59.846
- Let us out, see what happens.
- Don't mind me, guys.

47:59.913 --> 48:01.815
- You killed my chinchilla!
- Here for the kid.

48:01.882 --> 48:04.051
What's up, girl?
You're the reason I'm in here!

48:04.117 --> 48:05.819
Yeah, sorry about that.

48:05.886 --> 48:07.286
You're dead!

48:07.353 --> 48:08.254
I'm gonna kill
you, Quinn!

48:08.320 --> 48:10.289
Hey, kid.

48:10.356 --> 48:11.624
You're that psycho

48:11.691 --> 48:12.859
- from the roller derby.
- Yeah, yeah.

48:12.926 --> 48:14.527
Are you Cassandra Cain?

48:14.593 --> 48:15.728
Yeah.

48:27.406 --> 48:28.809
I need to know where...

48:40.020 --> 48:41.121
Hold, please.

48:41.188 --> 48:43.023
Harley...

50:03.636 --> 50:04.637
Hmm.

50:08.607 --> 50:10.376
I got you,
you little shit.

50:11.845 --> 50:12.846
Who are you guys?

50:14.380 --> 50:15.681
Go, go, go.

50:18.651 --> 50:20.053
Keep the kid alive.

51:18.711 --> 51:19.778
Mmm!

52:21.674 --> 52:23.176
A little help.

52:29.883 --> 52:30.817
Mmm...

52:41.593 --> 52:43.629
Does she have
to keep running?

53:12.392 --> 53:15.362
Roman,
you trustafarian fuckbag.

53:17.496 --> 53:18.764
You!

53:18.832 --> 53:19.732
You!

53:19.798 --> 53:21.667
Step away
from the kid.

53:22.836 --> 53:23.837
Drop it.

53:24.471 --> 53:25.671
The phone?

53:26.306 --> 53:27.573
Sure.

53:41.587 --> 53:42.621
Mmm.

54:02.342 --> 54:04.277
Whoa.

54:04.344 --> 54:05.744
Oh, good.
You're awake.

54:05.812 --> 54:07.780
Toss that for me, will ya?

54:21.194 --> 54:23.496
What the fuck?

54:23.562 --> 54:25.432
Who did I just blow up?

54:25.498 --> 54:27.500
Either someone
who wants me dead,

54:27.566 --> 54:28.935
or someone looking to collect

54:29.002 --> 54:31.304
the half-million dollar reward
on your head.

54:31.371 --> 54:33.239
Half a million dollars?

54:33.306 --> 54:34.808
Yeah.

54:34.874 --> 54:37.143
Do I look like I'm worth
half a million dollars?

54:37.210 --> 54:39.345
- Not really.
- You've got the wrong kid.

54:39.412 --> 54:41.314
Now, uncuff me.

54:41.381 --> 54:43.049
Oh, sure.

54:43.116 --> 54:44.517
As soon as you
give me the diamond.

54:44.583 --> 54:46.286
What diamond?

54:52.658 --> 54:54.060
Fuck you!

54:55.661 --> 54:57.030
Look at me.

55:00.033 --> 55:01.067
What?

55:01.134 --> 55:03.503
I don't know
nothing about no diamond.

55:03.570 --> 55:04.670
The inflection
in your voice,

55:04.736 --> 55:06.106
the way you can't
hold eye contact,

55:06.172 --> 55:07.440
and the fact that
you're a filthy little thief,

55:07.507 --> 55:08.942
all suggest that you do.

55:09.008 --> 55:11.478
Now, you can give it to
me, or I can give you

55:11.544 --> 55:13.046
to the man
that diamond belongs to.

55:13.113 --> 55:15.315
But trust me when I say,
you're not gonna like

55:15.381 --> 55:16.615
what he's gonna
do to ya.

55:17.417 --> 55:20.553
Now, hand it over.

55:20.619 --> 55:23.022
Yeah, not gonna happen.

55:24.491 --> 55:27.193
- Come again?
- I said I can't.

55:27.260 --> 55:28.461
One more time.

55:28.528 --> 55:30.296
- I can't give it to you.
- Why not?

55:30.363 --> 55:32.298
Because I ate it, okay?

55:39.506 --> 55:40.706
Yes.

55:41.773 --> 55:43.943
What are we even doing here?

55:44.010 --> 55:46.645
There are two ways that
diamond's coming outta ya.

55:47.580 --> 55:48.948
This way,

55:50.383 --> 55:51.951
or this way.

55:53.987 --> 55:55.421
That's what I thought.

55:55.488 --> 55:57.257
Also, I'm outta groceries.

56:00.726 --> 56:03.695
So, how long you been
a mercenary?

56:04.497 --> 56:05.899
Hey, where did you get...

56:05.965 --> 56:08.301
You're so busy
looking at my right hand,

56:08.368 --> 56:10.203
you haven't even
thought about my left.

56:10.270 --> 56:12.671
Your left hand is
cuffed to mine.

56:16.976 --> 56:19.045
I'll have
to learn that one.

56:20.146 --> 56:21.680
Can we get this?

56:21.747 --> 56:24.083
You're not gonna try to
run, are you?

56:24.150 --> 56:26.519
Look, if there's really
a half mil on my head,

56:26.586 --> 56:27.921
I figure
I'm better off with

56:27.987 --> 56:29.522
the person who's not
gonna cut me open.

56:29.589 --> 56:32.625
Fine. But if you try to
run, I will kill you.

56:32.691 --> 56:35.028
I do not care
that you're a kid.

56:37.763 --> 56:39.999
I saw that.

56:40.066 --> 56:42.936
Seriously though,
how'd you get to be here?

56:43.002 --> 56:46.306
I mean,
shopping at fancy-ass stores,

56:46.372 --> 56:50.143
you're making bank,
you have your own business.

56:50.210 --> 56:52.679
How'd you do it?
Come on, tell me.

56:52.744 --> 56:54.447
Woman to woman.

56:54.514 --> 56:58.651
Being a pickpocket's fine and
all, but I got real potential.

56:58.717 --> 57:00.486
I mean,
how do I be like you?

57:00.553 --> 57:04.824
Well, except for the crazy part.
But other than that.

57:04.891 --> 57:07.961
Number one,
no one is like me.

57:08.027 --> 57:09.761
If you wanted to
even come close,

57:09.829 --> 57:11.130
you would have to
go to medical school.

57:11.197 --> 57:14.234
Become a psychiatrist,
work in an asylum.

57:14.300 --> 57:15.734
Fall in love
with your patient,

57:15.802 --> 57:17.736
break said patient
out of said asylum.

57:17.804 --> 57:19.472
Begin a life of crime.

57:19.539 --> 57:21.207
Jump into a vat of chemicals
to prove yourself to a madman.

57:21.274 --> 57:23.142
Get arrested
by the Batman.

57:23.209 --> 57:24.877
Go back to jail,
get out of jail with a bomb on your neck.

57:24.944 --> 57:26.579
Save the world, go back to
jail, and break out of jail

57:26.646 --> 57:28.948
before breaking up
with the aforementioned madman

57:29.015 --> 57:30.917
and going out
on your own.

57:33.586 --> 57:35.622
Number two...

57:35.688 --> 57:37.257
Six bucks for tap water

57:37.323 --> 57:38.925
with a fucking cucumber stick
in it?

57:38.992 --> 57:40.159
That's crazy.

57:41.861 --> 57:44.063
I'm not shopping
at this store.

57:45.898 --> 57:47.766
I'm robbing this store.

57:47.834 --> 57:50.470
Consider this
your first lesson.

57:50.536 --> 57:52.805
Paying is for dummies.

57:58.978 --> 58:00.513
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

58:00.580 --> 58:02.282
Move it!

58:07.620 --> 58:09.222
Whoops. Ah...

58:11.357 --> 58:14.294
This is Doc's Place.
And this is Doc.

58:16.963 --> 58:18.797
Lotus flower!

58:18.865 --> 58:21.301
- Hiya, Doc. How are ya?
- Good.

58:21.367 --> 58:23.436
He's the Taiwanese grandpa
I never had.

58:23.503 --> 58:25.505
He knows everything
and everyone.

58:25.571 --> 58:27.273
Nothing happens around here,
let me tell you,

58:27.340 --> 58:28.908
without Doc
knowing about it.

58:28.975 --> 58:32.011
And he happens to be
the only person

58:32.078 --> 58:33.913
who actually cares
about me.

58:33.980 --> 58:35.648
- I do?
- Yes, you do.

58:35.715 --> 58:37.216
She's been ordering #32

58:37.283 --> 58:39.419
with extra chili
for many years.

58:39.485 --> 58:40.553
Lesson number two,

58:40.620 --> 58:42.488
you always want
extra chili with #32.

58:42.555 --> 58:44.424
So you don't
have to taste his cooking.

58:44.490 --> 58:47.427
Lotus flower, you have to get
upstairs before someone sees.

58:47.493 --> 58:49.796
Everyone's looking for you.
And you.

58:49.862 --> 58:51.764
We know.

58:51.831 --> 58:55.268
I'm telling you,
if you want boys to respect you,

58:55.335 --> 58:57.937
you have to show them
that you're serious.

58:58.004 --> 59:01.474
Blow something up.
Shoot someone.

59:01.541 --> 59:03.943
Nothing gets a guy's
attention like violence.

59:04.010 --> 59:06.112
Shut that door.
Lock it.

59:06.179 --> 59:08.548
Keep your sticky paws
to yourself, okay?

59:19.359 --> 59:20.860
This place...

59:20.927 --> 59:22.895
Well, it ain't much,
but it's better than a prison cell.

59:22.962 --> 59:24.897
...is so fucking dope.

59:26.733 --> 59:29.635
Oh, shit.
Is that a hyena in a bathtub?

59:29.702 --> 59:32.972
I named him Bruce after
that hunky Wayne guy.

59:33.039 --> 59:35.775
He's my little dumpling,
aren't you?

59:35.843 --> 59:37.977
Aren't you,
my little baby?

59:38.044 --> 59:40.046
Aren't you, Brucey?
Yes.

59:40.113 --> 59:42.014
I love you.

59:43.516 --> 59:46.953
I never said that.
I love you both equally.

59:47.019 --> 59:51.290
Who, that? It's Cass.

59:53.893 --> 59:55.261
You're so pretty.

59:57.096 --> 59:59.499
Who's this?

59:59.565 --> 1:00:01.534
It's a beaver.

1:00:01.601 --> 1:00:02.602
Hmm.

1:00:05.104 --> 1:00:09.375
Does Brucey want a treat?
Does Brucey want a treat?

1:00:11.277 --> 1:00:12.478
What's this?

1:00:16.382 --> 1:00:18.518
It's art.
Don't touch.

1:00:21.421 --> 1:00:23.824
He your
ex or something?

1:00:23.891 --> 1:00:25.558
You don't know
who that is?

1:00:26.959 --> 1:00:28.161
The Joker.

1:00:28.227 --> 1:00:30.997
The Clown Prince of Crime?

1:00:31.063 --> 1:00:32.665
My former partner
in madness?

1:00:32.732 --> 1:00:35.201
The Harlequin of Hate?
The Jester of Genocide?

1:00:35.268 --> 1:00:37.236
You've never heard of him?

1:00:37.303 --> 1:00:39.539
Well, sounds like a dick.

1:00:42.675 --> 1:00:43.676
Huh.

1:00:53.753 --> 1:00:55.121
Milk.

1:01:05.231 --> 1:01:09.235
<i>I'm not going soft or
nothing, but I gotta admit,</i>

1:01:09.302 --> 1:01:11.704
<i>it was kinda nice
having the kid around.</i>

1:01:22.482 --> 1:01:25.451
Give me a #32.
Mild.

1:01:25.518 --> 1:01:27.487
Uh... Yeah, sure.

1:01:48.741 --> 1:01:49.977
Who are you?

1:01:50.042 --> 1:01:51.444
They call me...

1:01:53.679 --> 1:01:54.982
H...

1:01:55.047 --> 1:01:56.716
<i>My bad.
I should've introduced you.</i>

1:01:56.782 --> 1:01:58.251
<i>I'll make it quick.</i>

1:02:02.288 --> 1:02:04.257
<i>Meet the daughter
of the richest,</i>

1:02:04.323 --> 1:02:07.660
<i>most powerful Mafia don
in Gotham City.</i>

1:02:07.727 --> 1:02:10.162
<i>Helena Bertinelli.</i>

1:02:10.229 --> 1:02:12.732
<i>Yep, that Bertinelli.</i>

1:02:14.433 --> 1:02:15.735
<i>One day,
she comes home to find</i>

1:02:15.802 --> 1:02:18.437
<i>her whole family
in the living room.</i>

1:02:18.504 --> 1:02:19.605
Momma.

1:02:21.374 --> 1:02:25.745
<i>Anyone and everyone with
Bertinelli blood is there.</i>

1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:31.018
<i>Oh, and that?
That's Stefano Galante.</i>

1:02:31.083 --> 1:02:32.451
<i>The guy
making the play for</i>

1:02:32.518 --> 1:02:34.754
<i>the Bertinelli
turf and fortune.</i>

1:02:58.511 --> 1:03:01.815
<i>When one of the goons
finds the kid alive,</i>

1:03:01.882 --> 1:03:03.884
<i>the big softy
sneaks her outta there</i>

1:03:03.951 --> 1:03:06.385
<i>and hides her away in Sicily.</i>

1:03:06.452 --> 1:03:08.654
<i>Where she is raised
by his own</i>

1:03:08.721 --> 1:03:11.858
<i>father and brother.
Both assassins.</i>

1:03:19.198 --> 1:03:23.569
<i>She spends the next 15 years
thinking only of revenge.</i>

1:03:24.470 --> 1:03:26.172
<i>So, she starts training.</i>

1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:29.342
<i>When she was ready,</i>

1:03:29.408 --> 1:03:30.743
<i>and by "ready" I mean</i>

1:03:30.811 --> 1:03:32.813
<i>a badass motherfucking
killing machine,</i>

1:03:36.449 --> 1:03:37.750
<i>she moves back
to Gotham.</i>

1:03:37.818 --> 1:03:39.485
<i>Starts working
on that kill list.</i>

1:03:47.961 --> 1:03:50.296
<i>She has the murder stuff
down, but the rest?</i>

1:03:50.363 --> 1:03:51.464
Do you know who I am?

1:03:51.530 --> 1:03:53.967
Do you know who I am?

1:03:54.034 --> 1:03:55.501
<i>Still a
work in progress.</i>

1:03:58.105 --> 1:03:59.806
Do you know who I am?

1:03:59.873 --> 1:04:01.273
The Crossbow Killer.

1:04:01.340 --> 1:04:02.675
They call me...

1:04:02.742 --> 1:04:04.710
The Crossbow Killer.

1:04:04.777 --> 1:04:06.278
They call me...

1:04:06.345 --> 1:04:09.148
The Crossbow Killer?

1:04:09.215 --> 1:04:10.549
They call me...

1:04:13.786 --> 1:04:14.888
Huntress.

1:04:14.955 --> 1:04:17.423
<i>She calls herself Huntress.</i>

1:04:17.490 --> 1:04:20.393
<i>Fucking fabulous,
if you ask me.</i>

1:04:20.459 --> 1:04:23.195
And who are you
looking for?

1:04:29.368 --> 1:04:30.904
Great club.

1:04:30.971 --> 1:04:32.538
Quinn got the girl.

1:04:32.605 --> 1:04:33.606
And?

1:04:34.340 --> 1:04:35.842
And they disappeared.

1:04:37.844 --> 1:04:39.712
Fuck!

1:04:41.114 --> 1:04:42.348
Fuck!

1:04:49.122 --> 1:04:50.690
What is she laughing at?

1:04:52.491 --> 1:04:53.793
Is she laughing at me?

1:04:53.860 --> 1:04:55.261
She is.

1:04:55.327 --> 1:04:57.097
No, she's not.
She's...

1:04:57.164 --> 1:04:59.498
What are you laughing at,
Erika?

1:04:59.565 --> 1:05:01.467
Roman, you gotta
hear this.

1:05:01.534 --> 1:05:04.203
- It's hilarious.
- Get on the table.

1:05:04.270 --> 1:05:05.504
- Oh.
- Ooh.

1:05:05.571 --> 1:05:07.740
You're being a total kook.

1:05:09.076 --> 1:05:11.011
Get on the fucking table.

1:05:12.611 --> 1:05:16.183
This is my club.
Get up now.

1:05:16.248 --> 1:05:17.683
- Okay.
- Now.

1:05:20.319 --> 1:05:21.654
Whoa.

1:05:23.990 --> 1:05:25.324
Now, dance.

1:05:31.230 --> 1:05:33.599
Dance.
Dance, Erika!

1:05:33.666 --> 1:05:34.901
Okay.

1:05:42.541 --> 1:05:45.244
This dress
is fucking hideous.

1:05:46.913 --> 1:05:47.981
Take it off.

1:05:49.950 --> 1:05:51.517
Take your dress off.

1:05:53.586 --> 1:05:55.755
Get up there and
fucking cut it off her.

1:05:56.890 --> 1:05:59.059
Do it now!

1:05:59.126 --> 1:06:01.360
Take her fucking dress off.

1:06:01.427 --> 1:06:03.262
Just rip it off her.
Hurry up!

1:06:03.329 --> 1:06:04.730
Hurry up!

1:06:06.499 --> 1:06:08.168
- Fucking do it.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:06:08.235 --> 1:06:09.236
Do it.

1:06:12.806 --> 1:06:15.641
Yeah. Beautiful.

1:06:30.924 --> 1:06:33.626
You wouldn't betray me,
would you?

1:06:35.829 --> 1:06:37.931
I was just
gonna go look for the girl.

1:06:37.998 --> 1:06:40.267
Oh, no, no, no.
I want you to stay here with me.

1:06:40.332 --> 1:06:43.536
I want you to stay here
with me close.

1:06:43.602 --> 1:06:46.072
You soothe me,
little bird.

1:07:00.553 --> 1:07:01.754
Oh, good.
You got it.

1:07:01.822 --> 1:07:03.355
Did you trace the messages?

1:07:03.422 --> 1:07:05.658
You stole evidence
from an active crime scene,

1:07:05.724 --> 1:07:07.093
and then had it
sent to my office.

1:07:08.460 --> 1:07:09.996
Renee, what were
you thinking?

1:07:10.063 --> 1:07:13.099
Roman is the one that put
a price on the kid's head.

1:07:13.166 --> 1:07:14.868
Okay? I had to.

1:07:14.935 --> 1:07:16.303
I can't get into it
right now...

1:07:16.368 --> 1:07:18.071
Renee, you need help.

1:07:18.138 --> 1:07:20.173
What are you talking about?

1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:22.474
She's right.

1:07:22.541 --> 1:07:26.079
You are a good cop, Montoya,
but you've lost your way.

1:07:27.314 --> 1:07:28.714
What?

1:07:28.781 --> 1:07:30.416
I'm sorry.
Okay?

1:07:30.482 --> 1:07:32.319
You gave me no choice.

1:07:32.384 --> 1:07:34.386
- Did you sell me out?
- I'm sorry.

1:07:35.021 --> 1:07:36.522
You're suspended.

1:07:37.523 --> 1:07:39.725
Your badge
and your gun, now.

1:07:43.562 --> 1:07:47.100
<i>If you've ever
watched any cop movie ever,</i>

1:07:47.167 --> 1:07:49.702
<i>you know that this is
when shit gets real.</i>

1:07:49.768 --> 1:07:51.704
What's the point
of the badge,

1:07:53.472 --> 1:07:55.608
when it means
fuck all anyway?

1:07:57.610 --> 1:07:59.511
Right, Captain?

1:07:59.578 --> 1:08:01.413
<i>No cop
ever gets anything done</i>

1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:03.682
<i>until after they've
been suspended.</i>

1:08:05.852 --> 1:08:07.486
<i>Which would've
had me worried,</i>

1:08:07.553 --> 1:08:10.623
<i>only I had
more pressing concerns.</i>

1:08:10.689 --> 1:08:12.391
And that is why
you should never partake

1:08:12.458 --> 1:08:14.793
in paying
federal income taxes.

1:08:14.861 --> 1:08:16.695
Hey,
you'll ruin your nails.

1:08:20.066 --> 1:08:21.334
Thank you.

1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:23.370
Anyway, lesson 37.

1:08:23.435 --> 1:08:24.838
Why...

1:08:26.273 --> 1:08:27.640
You said
they wouldn't find us.

1:08:27.706 --> 1:08:30.676
Chillax.
No one knows we're here.

1:08:30.743 --> 1:08:33.579
Harleen Quinzel,
this is Gotham Police.

1:08:33.646 --> 1:08:35.581
Okay.
So they know.

1:08:35.648 --> 1:08:36.950
Let's scram.

1:08:39.386 --> 1:08:40.854
Open the door.

1:08:40.921 --> 1:08:43.089
Holy back door, Beavy.
This is getting outta hand.

1:08:43.156 --> 1:08:44.391
Bruce, come here.

1:08:44.456 --> 1:08:45.791
I can hear you!
Open the door.

1:08:47.027 --> 1:08:48.028
What is that?

1:08:49.229 --> 1:08:51.597
See you in hell, Harley!

1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:55.835
Get under the table!

1:08:58.071 --> 1:09:00.073
Bruce? Bruce!

1:09:00.140 --> 1:09:01.174
Come here! No!

1:09:11.918 --> 1:09:12.919
Bruce?

1:09:14.821 --> 1:09:17.190
Come here, boy.
Bruce?

1:09:20.193 --> 1:09:21.194
Bruce?

1:09:22.929 --> 1:09:23.930
Bruce?

1:09:25.731 --> 1:09:27.801
This doesn't make sense.

1:09:27.867 --> 1:09:30.070
It doesn't make sense.
I don't understand.

1:09:30.971 --> 1:09:32.471
No one knew
we were here.

1:09:32.538 --> 1:09:34.074
No one knew we were
here, except...

1:09:35.075 --> 1:09:36.142
Doc.

1:09:36.209 --> 1:09:37.210
Oh, my God. Doc?

1:09:39.312 --> 1:09:41.513
Doc? Where is he?

1:09:42.983 --> 1:09:44.117
Doc?

1:09:44.184 --> 1:09:48.021
I can't find Bruce.
I can't find him. I...

1:09:54.593 --> 1:09:56.363
No.

1:09:56.429 --> 1:09:58.530
I'm sorry, lotus flower.

1:09:58.597 --> 1:10:00.333
You sold me out?

1:10:00.400 --> 1:10:03.569
Too many people offering
me too much money.

1:10:05.005 --> 1:10:07.740
I have enough now to
open up a new restaurant.

1:10:08.507 --> 1:10:09.876
A really nice one.

1:10:09.943 --> 1:10:11.177
But, Doc,

1:10:11.945 --> 1:10:13.746
it's me.

1:10:13.813 --> 1:10:15.815
It's just business.

1:10:42.641 --> 1:10:46.012
<i>This next
bit ain't very pretty.</i>

1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:49.149
- You're right.
- Harley?

1:10:49.715 --> 1:10:50.984
He's right.

1:10:53.253 --> 1:10:54.854
Business is business.

1:10:55.754 --> 1:10:58.224
I've got the kid.

1:10:58.291 --> 1:10:59.492
But I'm gonna need to

1:10:59.558 --> 1:11:01.227
renegotiate
the terms of our deal.

1:11:01.294 --> 1:11:02.862
If I hand her over,

1:11:02.929 --> 1:11:05.398
I want everyone who's
after me to back off.

1:11:05.465 --> 1:11:08.835
<i>Quinn,
bring me the rock now</i>

1:11:08.902 --> 1:11:10.837
<i>and I guarantee
your safety.</i>

1:11:10.904 --> 1:11:14.606
<i>I own this town.
You'll have my protection.</i>

1:11:14.673 --> 1:11:16.342
Fine.

1:11:16.409 --> 1:11:20.679
Meet me at Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap. In one hour.

1:11:30.290 --> 1:11:31.491
Quit judging.

1:11:34.693 --> 1:11:35.895
Zsasz!

1:11:42.601 --> 1:11:44.437
Come on, kid.

1:11:44.504 --> 1:11:46.439
Let's get you
somewhere safe.

1:11:46.506 --> 1:11:47.639
We got them.

1:11:51.578 --> 1:11:53.313
Little bird!

1:11:53.379 --> 1:11:56.748
You're gonna be
driving Mr. Zsasz tonight.

1:11:56.816 --> 1:12:01.020
Go. Fetch. Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap.

1:12:01.087 --> 1:12:03.423
Do we have
to bring them back?

1:12:03.490 --> 1:12:06.960
I think you can manage
a couple of little girls.

1:12:08.094 --> 1:12:10.696
Just bring me back
my diamond.

1:12:57.210 --> 1:12:58.211
What is it?

1:12:59.579 --> 1:13:00.779
Nothing.

1:13:13.759 --> 1:13:15.261
Pull over.

1:13:15.328 --> 1:13:16.529
What?

1:13:16.596 --> 1:13:19.265
Pull the fucking car
over now.

1:13:21.601 --> 1:13:23.469
I gotta take a leak.

1:13:26.472 --> 1:13:29.542
<i>She betrayed you, boss.
She betrayed you.</i>

1:13:29.609 --> 1:13:31.010
Are you sure?

1:13:31.077 --> 1:13:34.013
<i>Your little bird's
a fucking rat.</i>

1:13:41.221 --> 1:13:43.223
<i>You want me
to kill her?</i>

1:13:46.559 --> 1:13:47.627
No.

1:13:47.694 --> 1:13:49.896
No. No.

1:13:49.963 --> 1:13:51.898
I'll come to you.

1:14:27.400 --> 1:14:30.136
I thought we were friends.
And you...

1:14:30.203 --> 1:14:31.871
You saw what it's
like for me out there.

1:14:31.938 --> 1:14:33.606
I didn't have a choice.

1:14:33.673 --> 1:14:36.909
And if you go before he gets
here, everything will be fine.

1:14:38.711 --> 1:14:40.246
Harley.

1:14:40.313 --> 1:14:43.049
I'm sorry, kid. I am.

1:14:53.293 --> 1:14:54.494
That was fast.

1:14:57.730 --> 1:14:59.399
She's in...

1:14:59.465 --> 1:15:00.933
Where's Cassandra Cain?

1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.469
You? Again?

1:15:12.745 --> 1:15:13.813
Are you drunk?

1:15:13.880 --> 1:15:15.481
Come on.

1:15:15.548 --> 1:15:16.549
Okay.

1:15:38.938 --> 1:15:40.306
Right in the tit.

1:15:46.245 --> 1:15:48.381
Where's Cassandra Cain?

1:15:49.549 --> 1:15:50.550
Cass.

1:15:57.223 --> 1:15:59.992
You killed my sandwich!

1:16:07.066 --> 1:16:08.468
Bye-bye, birdie.

1:16:09.936 --> 1:16:11.137
Ow!

1:16:12.872 --> 1:16:14.607
No fair.

1:16:14.674 --> 1:16:16.342
Was that really necessary?

1:16:16.409 --> 1:16:18.344
You don't know her
like I do.

1:16:18.911 --> 1:16:20.113
Cass?

1:16:24.016 --> 1:16:25.485
Oh, thank God.

1:16:26.419 --> 1:16:27.754
I'm gonna get you
outta here.

1:16:27.821 --> 1:16:29.122
Did she really tape you

1:16:29.188 --> 1:16:30.990
- to a damn toilet?
- Mmm-hmm.

1:16:32.658 --> 1:16:33.726
Hmm.

1:16:33.793 --> 1:16:35.361
This is nice.

1:16:36.195 --> 1:16:38.030
You're still conscious.

1:16:40.133 --> 1:16:41.467
You can still feel?

1:16:41.534 --> 1:16:44.637
Look at me.
Are you a good girl, now?

1:16:46.239 --> 1:16:50.543
"I'm a good girl.
I'm a good girl."

1:17:01.687 --> 1:17:03.055
I got one

1:17:03.891 --> 1:17:05.224
for all the little birds

1:17:05.291 --> 1:17:09.061
I helped fly away
from this world.

1:17:09.128 --> 1:17:11.964
I'm saving
a special spot for you.

1:17:13.166 --> 1:17:14.634
Right here.

1:17:19.772 --> 1:17:20.773
You're gonna
have to be quiet.

1:17:20.841 --> 1:17:22.008
- Ow!
- Hi.

1:17:22.074 --> 1:17:23.543
What are you guys doing?

1:17:27.513 --> 1:17:30.450
Oh, I know
where the diamond is.

1:17:30.516 --> 1:17:33.686
Is that rock
still inside you?

1:17:36.722 --> 1:17:38.324
Oh, God.

1:17:41.427 --> 1:17:42.462
Stop.

1:17:44.730 --> 1:17:46.098
The hell, Zsasz?

1:17:46.867 --> 1:17:48.034
Cut her open.

1:17:48.100 --> 1:17:49.535
Stop fucking around.

1:17:49.602 --> 1:17:50.970
You heard me.

1:17:51.037 --> 1:17:53.339
Cut her fucking open.

1:17:53.406 --> 1:17:56.409
Okay. No, no. No, no, no.
See, she's just a kid.

1:17:56.476 --> 1:17:58.846
You're a filthy
fucking rat.

1:17:58.912 --> 1:18:00.446
I'm a rat?

1:18:00.513 --> 1:18:04.083
I knew you couldn't be trusted.
Roman's little bird.

1:18:04.150 --> 1:18:06.552
You little fucking bird.

1:18:06.619 --> 1:18:09.288
That's why he needs me
to look out for him.

1:18:11.123 --> 1:18:14.260
That's why he needs me
to take care of him.

1:18:15.829 --> 1:18:18.899
You know you're just
being paranoid, Zsasz.

1:18:18.966 --> 1:18:20.199
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1:18:20.266 --> 1:18:21.567
Prove it to me.

1:18:22.836 --> 1:18:25.137
Rip open
her little tummy.

1:18:25.204 --> 1:18:26.706
Yeah,
that's not gonna happen.

1:18:26.772 --> 1:18:29.108
Now! Rip it open!

1:18:42.755 --> 1:18:44.724
You piece of shit!

1:18:53.032 --> 1:18:54.233
Freeze!

1:18:58.104 --> 1:18:59.539
Don't fucking move.

1:19:01.942 --> 1:19:03.576
Who the fuck are you?

1:19:10.750 --> 1:19:11.818
Go get the kid.

1:19:11.885 --> 1:19:13.386
All right.

1:19:13.452 --> 1:19:15.221
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Back the fuck up!

1:19:15.288 --> 1:19:17.891
- Get away from me. All of you.
- Put that shit down.

1:19:17.958 --> 1:19:19.993
Shoot them, kid.

1:19:20.059 --> 1:19:23.931
You, put that stupid-ass
Robin Hood piece of shit down!

1:19:23.997 --> 1:19:27.066
- Cass, it's okay. Just calm...
- Don't move!

1:19:27.133 --> 1:19:28.802
Okay.

1:19:28.869 --> 1:19:31.170
I don't know what
the fuck is going on.

1:19:31.237 --> 1:19:32.772
But I know
that this shit stick...

1:19:34.407 --> 1:19:36.409
...just tried to gut me.

1:19:37.410 --> 1:19:38.411
And you.

1:19:40.513 --> 1:19:42.315
Thought you were different.

1:19:45.084 --> 1:19:46.485
I'm sorry, kid.

1:19:48.822 --> 1:19:51.591
I'm just a terrible person,
I guess.

1:19:58.564 --> 1:19:59.565
Ooh!

1:20:00.299 --> 1:20:01.634
Ooh, I'm back.

1:20:01.701 --> 1:20:03.603
Okay, I feel like
I've just walked in on

1:20:03.669 --> 1:20:05.171
something I don't
give two shits about.

1:20:05.237 --> 1:20:06.405
This guy's dead,
so I'm just

1:20:06.472 --> 1:20:07.908
gonna get outta your hair. Cool?

1:20:07.975 --> 1:20:10.576
No. Wait. She's lying.
She works for Sionis.

1:20:10.643 --> 1:20:12.778
Excuse me?
I work for Sionis?

1:20:14.347 --> 1:20:17.084
I'm not letting you
sell the kid to him.

1:20:17.149 --> 1:20:18.517
I wasn't going
to sell the kid.

1:20:18.584 --> 1:20:20.219
I was going
to trade the kid.

1:20:20.286 --> 1:20:22.089
Yeah. To save your own stupid skin.
Huh?

1:20:22.154 --> 1:20:23.322
I'm not proud
of what I did,

1:20:23.389 --> 1:20:25.157
but I had
half the city after me.

1:20:25.224 --> 1:20:27.126
Even the fucking
Crossbow Killer.

1:20:27.193 --> 1:20:28.929
I'm not
the Crossbow Killer!

1:20:28.996 --> 1:20:30.196
Whoa.

1:20:31.932 --> 1:20:33.033
They call me...

1:20:33.100 --> 1:20:34.667
Helena Bertinelli.

1:20:34.734 --> 1:20:35.601
For fuck's sake.

1:20:35.668 --> 1:20:37.737
As in
the Bertinelli massacre?

1:20:37.804 --> 1:20:41.808
Sheesh kebab.
That is childhood trauma, right there.

1:20:47.513 --> 1:20:49.582
<i>I killed Galante.</i>

1:20:53.352 --> 1:20:55.022
I killed his firing squad.

1:20:59.993 --> 1:21:02.595
<i>I killed Victor Zsasz.</i>

1:21:08.200 --> 1:21:09.803
And now I'm done.

1:21:11.637 --> 1:21:12.738
Bravo.

1:21:17.777 --> 1:21:19.545
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna leave now.

1:21:19.612 --> 1:21:21.948
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

1:21:22.015 --> 1:21:23.449
I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

1:21:23.516 --> 1:21:25.852
sweetheart,
but you are not done.

1:21:25.919 --> 1:21:26.987
Who do you think funded

1:21:27.054 --> 1:21:28.621
Galante's little
power grab, huh?

1:21:28.688 --> 1:21:30.456
Galante was
working with Sionis.

1:21:30.523 --> 1:21:32.826
Roman killed your whole
family looking for that rock.

1:21:32.893 --> 1:21:35.761
You don't think
he's gonna kill this kid?

1:21:35.829 --> 1:21:38.464
That diamond is our only
chance of stopping him.

1:21:38.531 --> 1:21:39.699
You guys.

1:21:39.765 --> 1:21:42.334
Hey, I think
you should see this.

1:21:44.838 --> 1:21:45.872
Oh.

1:21:45.939 --> 1:21:47.606
It's Sionis.

1:21:59.953 --> 1:22:02.155
We're fucked.

1:22:02.221 --> 1:22:04.290
He bought himself an army.

1:22:12.966 --> 1:22:13.967
They're all here for me.

1:22:16.136 --> 1:22:17.670
Aren't they?

1:22:24.310 --> 1:22:26.079
- No.
- They're not?

1:22:26.146 --> 1:22:28.347
No, they're not.

1:22:28.414 --> 1:22:29.950
Do you know
what that means?

1:22:30.016 --> 1:22:31.550
That means he's not just
after the kid anymore.

1:22:31.617 --> 1:22:33.053
He's after all of us.

1:22:33.120 --> 1:22:35.956
He's sure as hell after me.
I just robbed him.

1:22:36.022 --> 1:22:39.258
You just betrayed him.
You just killed his BFF.

1:22:39.325 --> 1:22:40.693
And you're dumb enough

1:22:40.760 --> 1:22:42.795
to be building
a case against him.

1:22:42.863 --> 1:22:45.598
So, unless we all wanna
die very unpleasant deaths

1:22:45.664 --> 1:22:47.366
and let Roman
go finger-fishing

1:22:47.433 --> 1:22:49.035
in the kid's intestinal tract,

1:22:50.536 --> 1:22:51.972
we're gonna have
to work together.

1:22:53.240 --> 1:22:54.607
With you?

1:22:54.673 --> 1:22:55.909
Yeah.

1:22:55.976 --> 1:22:57.476
We're gonna work together,

1:22:57.543 --> 1:22:59.012
and we'll get outta here
in one piece, okay?

1:23:03.216 --> 1:23:04.517
Okay.

1:23:05.451 --> 1:23:07.888
Yeah. Okay.

1:23:10.790 --> 1:23:11.925
Sure.

1:23:11.992 --> 1:23:13.359
Yes!

1:23:13.425 --> 1:23:15.728
But we are gonna need
some serious hardware.

1:23:15.795 --> 1:23:16.796
Mmm-hmm.

1:23:20.533 --> 1:23:23.335
Will this do?

1:23:24.805 --> 1:23:25.771
No.

1:23:25.839 --> 1:23:27.640
Not at all.

1:23:29.810 --> 1:23:31.544
We're dead.
We're fucking dead.

1:23:31.610 --> 1:23:33.880
That slimy jizznozzle!
I can't believe

1:23:33.947 --> 1:23:35.816
- he took it all!
- We're fucked.

1:23:35.882 --> 1:23:38.417
- Fuck!
- Uh, there's this.

1:23:44.790 --> 1:23:45.826
Okay.

1:23:57.204 --> 1:24:01.975
Friends,
brothers, men of Gotham.

1:24:03.043 --> 1:24:07.713
I have funded you.
I've protected you.

1:24:07.780 --> 1:24:11.750
I've scratched your backs
and kept you outta jail.

1:24:11.818 --> 1:24:14.553
Well, now it's time
to say thank you.

1:24:15.788 --> 1:24:17.858
Go show those little bitches

1:24:17.924 --> 1:24:21.727
you don't mess
with Roman Sionis.

1:24:21.794 --> 1:24:25.332
Half a mil to whoever
brings me the girl alive.

1:24:25.397 --> 1:24:27.633
The rest you can kill.

1:24:33.739 --> 1:24:34.740
Dope.

1:24:36.542 --> 1:24:38.178
Oh, no, no, no.
Not that one.

1:24:38.245 --> 1:24:40.446
Sentimental value.
Try this.

1:24:42.514 --> 1:24:43.884
You're kidding.

1:24:43.950 --> 1:24:45.651
What?
Gotta take care of the girls.

1:24:45.718 --> 1:24:47.486
Isn't this fun?
It's just like a sleepover.

1:24:47.553 --> 1:24:49.823
We should order pizza.
Make cosmos.

1:24:49.890 --> 1:24:51.992
- Harley, focus. Yeah.
- Okay.

1:24:53.293 --> 1:24:54.660
Hey, nice.
What the hell is up

1:24:54.727 --> 1:24:55.929
with this bow
and arrow shtick?

1:24:55.996 --> 1:24:57.463
It's not a fucking
bow and arrow.

1:24:57.529 --> 1:24:58.999
It's a crossbow.
I'm not 12.

1:24:59.065 --> 1:25:00.799
I love this chick.
She's got rage issues.

1:25:00.867 --> 1:25:02.534
I don't have rage issues.

1:25:02.601 --> 1:25:05.205
You know,
psychologically speaking,

1:25:05.272 --> 1:25:08.041
vengeance rarely brings
the catharsis we hope for.

1:25:08.108 --> 1:25:09.376
Yeah.

1:25:09.441 --> 1:25:11.912
Are we ready?
Bad guys, just outside.

1:25:16.249 --> 1:25:17.516
Shit. Get down.

1:25:19.319 --> 1:25:20.653
Down here!

1:25:22.355 --> 1:25:23.622
Cass!

1:25:23.689 --> 1:25:25.691
- Follow me!
- Go, go, go, go!

1:25:25.758 --> 1:25:27.227
Go!

1:25:31.563 --> 1:25:33.099
Holy shit!

1:25:54.120 --> 1:25:55.422
What?

1:25:55.487 --> 1:25:57.556
You are so cool.

1:25:57.623 --> 1:25:59.259
Okay. This way.

1:26:08.068 --> 1:26:09.436
Get ready, ladies.

1:26:20.146 --> 1:26:21.414
Don't worry.
You're gonna make it.

1:26:21.480 --> 1:26:22.949
Okay? Okay.

1:26:23.016 --> 1:26:25.751
What the...
Go! Go, go, go!

1:26:26.453 --> 1:26:27.653
Fuck.

1:26:29.788 --> 1:26:30.991
Shit.

1:26:40.967 --> 1:26:42.235
Whoa. Shit!

1:27:01.620 --> 1:27:02.989
Motherfucker.

1:27:16.302 --> 1:27:18.338
Let me go!

1:27:18.405 --> 1:27:20.006
Gotcha.

1:27:21.174 --> 1:27:22.208
This way!

1:27:22.275 --> 1:27:23.810
Come on. Come on.
It's okay. Come on.

1:27:23.877 --> 1:27:25.879
You shouldn't
have to see this.

1:27:25.945 --> 1:27:27.713
Here, hold on to this
for me, okay?

1:27:27.780 --> 1:27:29.082
That's all you think about.

1:27:29.149 --> 1:27:30.450
Just close your eyes
and hold it tight. Okay?

1:27:32.018 --> 1:27:33.987
Here. Get down. Come on.
You'll be safe.

1:28:16.162 --> 1:28:17.163
Canary!

1:28:18.664 --> 1:28:20.567
You okay?

1:28:20.632 --> 1:28:22.235
We gotta go this way!

1:28:24.571 --> 1:28:26.139
Ugh. More?

1:28:26.206 --> 1:28:28.141
When the fuck did she have
time to do a shoe change?

1:28:28.208 --> 1:28:29.342
Come on.

1:28:36.382 --> 1:28:37.383
Thanks.

1:28:50.864 --> 1:28:52.065
Duck!

1:28:56.369 --> 1:28:57.703
- Hair tie?
- Yeah.

1:28:58.605 --> 1:28:59.671
Ah, fuck!

1:29:04.776 --> 1:29:06.045
I got him!

1:29:09.516 --> 1:29:10.817
Get back here, kid!

1:29:14.621 --> 1:29:16.022
Who's got the kid?

1:29:28.667 --> 1:29:29.869
Get down!

1:29:40.280 --> 1:29:42.982
Please, no more.

1:29:47.654 --> 1:29:49.088
So, forgive me yet?

1:29:49.155 --> 1:29:50.223
Get off me.

1:29:54.928 --> 1:29:57.230
Anyone else hungry?
I know a great taco spot.

1:29:57.297 --> 1:29:58.631
- I'm starving.
- I love tacos.

1:29:58.697 --> 1:29:59.999
Really?

1:30:08.208 --> 1:30:09.943
Down! Get down!

1:30:10.009 --> 1:30:11.578
You're okay.
You're okay.

1:30:11.644 --> 1:30:14.247
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Let me check it.

1:30:16.715 --> 1:30:17.951
Get off!

1:30:18.017 --> 1:30:19.385
I got you.

1:30:19.452 --> 1:30:21.087
Ooh!

1:30:21.154 --> 1:30:23.656
Aren't you glad you wore that?
Sexy and bulletproof.

1:30:23.722 --> 1:30:26.626
Harley! No!
Get off me!

1:30:26.693 --> 1:30:27.759
Harley!

1:30:27.827 --> 1:30:29.395
They got the kid.
Shit!

1:30:29.462 --> 1:30:33.900
We can't let them get her.
I trust you.

1:30:33.967 --> 1:30:35.802
- One bullet?
- Please help me!

1:30:35.868 --> 1:30:37.370
Has anyone
got any bullets?

1:30:37.437 --> 1:30:39.606
Fuck. I'm out.

1:30:39.672 --> 1:30:42.809
I can't get out there.
I just need to get through.

1:30:42.875 --> 1:30:44.776
- We gotta go. We gotta move.
- Shit.

1:30:44.844 --> 1:30:46.512
Guys, they're in the car.

1:30:46.579 --> 1:30:48.481
They're getting away.

1:30:48.548 --> 1:30:50.083
- Get in there!
- Get off!

1:30:52.518 --> 1:30:54.420
Shit! I'm out.

1:30:54.487 --> 1:30:56.189
Guys, come on.
They're closing in.

1:30:57.724 --> 1:31:00.994
Canary, you know
what you have to do!

1:31:01.060 --> 1:31:03.997
Cover your ears!
You better get her back.

1:31:24.017 --> 1:31:26.319
<i>Told ya she had
a killer voice.</i>

1:31:47.674 --> 1:31:48.875
Need a ride?

1:32:14.701 --> 1:32:15.902
Get her!

1:32:46.834 --> 1:32:48.634
Oh!

1:32:59.412 --> 1:33:00.513
Whip me!

1:33:00.580 --> 1:33:01.614
What?

1:33:01.681 --> 1:33:03.049
- Whip me!
- Okay.

1:33:10.890 --> 1:33:12.091
Kid!

1:33:12.658 --> 1:33:13.659
Harley!

1:33:14.794 --> 1:33:15.995
Shoot her!

1:33:24.470 --> 1:33:25.738
Harley!

1:33:25.806 --> 1:33:27.306
Hit the brakes!

1:33:46.959 --> 1:33:48.327
No!

1:34:01.707 --> 1:34:02.708
Uh-oh.

1:34:29.735 --> 1:34:31.037
Kid!

1:34:42.982 --> 1:34:44.417
Harley!

1:35:02.201 --> 1:35:03.769
Well,
we always did share

1:35:03.837 --> 1:35:05.171
a love of the dramatic.

1:35:05.238 --> 1:35:06.439
Didn't we?

1:35:08.774 --> 1:35:10.443
And look at us now.

1:35:11.777 --> 1:35:14.380
But don't you see?
You're trying to kill me.

1:35:14.447 --> 1:35:17.083
I'm the only one
who can protect you!

1:35:19.685 --> 1:35:22.154
You know you can't
stand on your own, Quinn.

1:35:22.221 --> 1:35:23.589
You're not the type!

1:35:24.925 --> 1:35:28.160
But me?
You need me!

1:35:42.408 --> 1:35:45.511
Here's the thing,
Romy baby.

1:35:47.413 --> 1:35:49.549
Your protection is
based on the fact

1:35:49.615 --> 1:35:51.852
that people
are scared of you.

1:35:51.919 --> 1:35:53.820
Just like
they're scared of Mr. J.

1:35:59.292 --> 1:36:02.061
But I'm the one
they should be scared of.

1:36:02.128 --> 1:36:04.564
Not you, and not Mr. J.

1:36:04.630 --> 1:36:08.035
'Cause
I'm Harley fucking Quinn.

1:36:15.374 --> 1:36:16.642
Shit.

1:36:18.177 --> 1:36:19.947
That was super embarrassing.

1:36:20.013 --> 1:36:21.581
Hmm. Sure was.

1:36:21.647 --> 1:36:25.451
You think you can beat me?
You're a fucking moron.

1:36:26.987 --> 1:36:29.188
I'm sorry, kid.

1:36:29.255 --> 1:36:30.924
And I'm sorry
I tried to sell you.

1:36:30.991 --> 1:36:32.692
That was a dick move.

1:36:34.293 --> 1:36:36.930
For what it's worth,

1:36:36.997 --> 1:36:40.633
you made me want to be
a less terrible person.

1:36:41.767 --> 1:36:43.169
Ew.

1:36:43.235 --> 1:36:46.238
If we're apologizing for shit,
I should tell you something.

1:36:46.305 --> 1:36:47.607
Excuse me!

1:36:47.673 --> 1:36:50.209
I stole something from you.

1:36:50.276 --> 1:36:52.278
You slippery-fingered
little turd.

1:36:52.345 --> 1:36:53.947
I took your ring.

1:36:54.014 --> 1:36:55.348
My ring?

1:36:58.018 --> 1:36:59.218
Dope.

1:37:19.171 --> 1:37:21.074
Cass! Harley!

1:37:21.140 --> 1:37:22.575
We're okay.

1:37:26.212 --> 1:37:27.747
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1:37:28.547 --> 1:37:30.449
- He's gone?
- Mmm-hmm.

1:37:30.516 --> 1:37:32.652
Good. Fuck that guy.

1:37:32.718 --> 1:37:34.487
Yeah. Tacos?

1:37:35.655 --> 1:37:37.057
No, but seriously.

1:37:37.124 --> 1:37:38.992
You were very impressive
with that bow.

1:37:39.059 --> 1:37:40.192
Very impressive.

1:37:40.259 --> 1:37:41.494
It's a crossbow.

1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:42.863
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

1:37:42.929 --> 1:37:44.363
- Mmm-hmm.
- Morning margaritas!

1:37:44.430 --> 1:37:45.564
Thank you. I got you.

1:37:45.631 --> 1:37:46.766
- You drink, right, kid?
- Yeah.

1:37:46.833 --> 1:37:48.334
I don't think so.

1:37:48.401 --> 1:37:50.436
And I love that fucking
name, Huntress.

1:37:50.503 --> 1:37:52.039
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:37:52.105 --> 1:37:53.572
Oh, great name.

1:37:53.639 --> 1:37:54.674
Wow.

1:37:54.740 --> 1:37:57.343
Um... I really like
how you were able

1:37:57.410 --> 1:37:59.512
to kick so high
in those tight pants.

1:37:59.578 --> 1:38:01.114
- Yeah, that is cool.
- Yeah.

1:38:01.180 --> 1:38:02.949
- Thanks.
- Oh, um...

1:38:03.016 --> 1:38:05.451
Thanks for the car.

1:38:06.920 --> 1:38:08.487
You're welcome.

1:38:08.554 --> 1:38:10.489
Kid, if that burrito
doesn't make you shit,

1:38:10.556 --> 1:38:12.591
I don't know what will.

1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:15.394
Give me a minute.

1:38:17.164 --> 1:38:18.364
Yes!

1:38:18.431 --> 1:38:20.934
Right.

1:38:22.435 --> 1:38:23.904
I've given her prune
juice, laxatives.

1:38:23.970 --> 1:38:26.272
I mean, the kid's got
a stomach made of steel.

1:38:26.338 --> 1:38:28.607
And you know what?
I owe you an apology.

1:38:29.208 --> 1:38:30.811
Me?

1:38:30.877 --> 1:38:34.413
I underestimated you.
And I'm sorry.

1:38:35.748 --> 1:38:37.750
I'm used to it.

1:38:37.818 --> 1:38:41.220
Uh, Harley!
Bring the colander.

1:38:42.823 --> 1:38:43.924
Ladies.

1:38:43.990 --> 1:38:45.658
Have fun with that.

1:38:46.960 --> 1:38:49.528
So, what now?

1:38:49.595 --> 1:38:50.897
Sionis is gone,
but it's just

1:38:50.964 --> 1:38:53.066
a matter of time
before some other asshole

1:38:53.133 --> 1:38:54.533
tries to finish
what he started.

1:38:54.600 --> 1:38:55.701
Right.

1:38:55.768 --> 1:38:59.139
We gotta clean this city
from the inside out.

1:38:59.206 --> 1:39:01.540
Does she always talk like
the cop in a bad '80s movie,

1:39:01.607 --> 1:39:03.043
or is that just me?

1:39:03.110 --> 1:39:04.211
Fuck you.
And fuck you.

1:39:04.276 --> 1:39:05.611
What?

1:39:05.678 --> 1:39:07.814
I mean,
we were amazing there.

1:39:07.881 --> 1:39:09.182
Yeah! Hell yeah!

1:39:09.248 --> 1:39:12.718
I agree completely.
So I'll do that, as well.

1:39:12.785 --> 1:39:13.686
Thank you.

1:39:13.753 --> 1:39:14.955
Right.

1:39:15.021 --> 1:39:16.022
Whoa. Whoa, whoa!

1:39:18.892 --> 1:39:20.026
She stole my fucking car!

1:39:20.093 --> 1:39:21.161
What?

1:39:25.232 --> 1:39:26.599
I'm sorry.

1:39:26.665 --> 1:39:28.235
<i>I know
what you're thinking.</i>

1:39:28.300 --> 1:39:30.203
You think I'm a dick
after all that.

1:39:30.269 --> 1:39:33.907
But you heard what the cop said.
Sionis is gone.

1:39:33.974 --> 1:39:39.745
And those guys?
They're gonna be just fine.

1:39:39.813 --> 1:39:41.280
<i>Montoya's boss picked up</i>

1:39:41.347 --> 1:39:43.116
<i>the gangbangers
at the Booby Trap.</i>

1:39:43.183 --> 1:39:46.585
<i>And took all the credit
while he was at it.</i>

1:39:46.652 --> 1:39:47.686
<i>Again.</i>

1:39:53.193 --> 1:39:54.895
<i>It was the kick in
the balls she needed</i>

1:39:54.961 --> 1:39:56.796
<i>to see that she had
nothing to prove</i>

1:39:56.863 --> 1:39:59.431
<i>to those blowhard assholes.</i>

1:39:59.498 --> 1:40:02.068
<i>She quit the same day.</i>

1:40:06.338 --> 1:40:08.674
<i>We got the secret bank codes
off the diamond.</i>

1:40:08.741 --> 1:40:11.343
<i>And Huntress
got her family money back.</i>

1:40:12.478 --> 1:40:13.679
<i>She's using it to fund</i>

1:40:13.746 --> 1:40:15.481
<i>a little
crime-fighting outfit.</i>

1:40:18.185 --> 1:40:22.488
<i>They call themselves
the Birds of Prey.</i>

1:40:22.555 --> 1:40:25.524
<i>I call them
dorky little do-gooders.</i>

1:40:27.894 --> 1:40:31.031
<i>The rock itself was worth
a chunk of change,</i>

1:40:31.097 --> 1:40:32.531
<i>so I pawned it.</i>

1:40:32.598 --> 1:40:34.366
<i>And I invested the cash
in a little startup</i>

1:40:34.433 --> 1:40:36.036
<i>making waves
in the East End.</i>

1:40:40.140 --> 1:40:41.875
<i>Oh! And I found Bruce.</i>

1:40:41.942 --> 1:40:44.443
<i>He was wandering
around Chinatown.</i>

1:40:44.510 --> 1:40:45.912
<i>I guess it proves the theory</i>

1:40:45.979 --> 1:40:48.514
<i>that hyenas
really do have nine lives.</i>

1:41:08.500 --> 1:41:12.339
<i>Yeah, yeah.
I made the kid my apprentice.</i>

1:41:12.404 --> 1:41:14.140
<i>Call me a softy.</i>

1:41:15.407 --> 1:41:16.675
I dare ya.

1:41:21.214 --> 1:41:22.581
Mmm!

1:48:40.620 --> 1:48:43.122
<i>Are you dummies
still sitting there?</i>

1:48:43.189 --> 1:48:45.191
<i>Fine. Since you
stuck it out this long,</i>

1:48:45.258 --> 1:48:47.493
<i>I'll tell you
a super-duper secret secret.</i>

1:48:47.560 --> 1:48:49.228
