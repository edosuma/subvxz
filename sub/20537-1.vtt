00:40.645 --> 00:43.648
2416, the Earth forces
wiped out the Fox

00:43.648 --> 00:46.109
that had escaped from Earth and
have settled down in Mars.

00:46.109 --> 00:50.613
The only surviving girl seized
a spaceship of the Earth forces,

00:52.866 --> 00:56.411
seeking asylum in Titan
where the Robot live.

01:32.989 --> 01:36.826
Destination: Elevator Station,
Titan's orbit

02:26.918 --> 02:30.588
Horror Stories III

02:30.588 --> 02:34.092
A girl from Mars

03:53.463 --> 03:54.672
Human!

03:57.050 --> 03:59.343
Kill it!

03:59.594 --> 04:01.512
No, I'm not a human.

04:01.512 --> 04:03.347
I'm a Martian citizen!

04:04.557 --> 04:06.809
I'm officially applying for
asylum in this sanctuary!

05:02.698 --> 05:03.741
Who are you?

05:05.034 --> 05:06.911
I said I'm from Mars.

05:07.995 --> 05:11.582
Wherever you're from,
a human shall no longer live.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.085
I'm not a human.

05:14.585 --> 05:18.297
The Earth forces came
and killed my own species!

05:19.507 --> 05:22.426
My parents died.

05:22.426 --> 05:25.304
My friends and teachers
are all dead.

05:26.514 --> 05:28.975
The only survivor is me.

05:29.725 --> 05:33.229
Your reaction is
just like human's.

05:34.438 --> 05:36.357
I said I'm not a human!

05:36.774 --> 05:41.195
So, who are you?

05:44.156 --> 05:45.116
Wait!

06:16.981 --> 06:18.983
May I?

06:26.532 --> 06:33.122
A scholar named LEE Saeng
dropped by my town that day.

06:35.333 --> 06:37.501
Fox Valley

06:37.501 --> 06:38.628
A lot of pain?

06:39.754 --> 06:41.380
We're almost there.

06:41.380 --> 06:43.883
Thank you for saving my life.
I'll never forget it.

06:44.634 --> 06:46.969
This country
have thieves everywhere

06:47.553 --> 06:50.139
to thank for corrupt officials,
misdirecting this country.

06:50.848 --> 06:53.142
I'll hold government positions
and take up the slack.

06:54.810 --> 06:58.397
You passed the state examination.
Don't fail to keep your promise.

07:03.527 --> 07:04.820
There's something in the air.

07:04.820 --> 07:06.489
You're in no position
to be picky.

07:07.323 --> 07:08.824
Your leg is
in bad shape too.

07:18.834 --> 07:19.919
Anybody home?

07:20.711 --> 07:23.381
From the back,
it looks like a woman.

07:28.886 --> 07:30.221
Excuse me.

07:32.473 --> 07:34.016
We bumped into the brigand.

07:34.016 --> 07:35.351
He hurt his leg
and we got lost.

07:36.310 --> 07:38.354
Can we stay at your place
for a night?

07:43.484 --> 07:47.488
You must be hungry.
Please eat first.

07:57.039 --> 07:58.707
Today is the anniversary of
my son's death.

08:00.876 --> 08:04.255
That must be hard for
my daughter-in-law.

08:12.263 --> 08:14.557
It's once a year.

08:15.641 --> 08:17.184
Help yourself.

08:18.602 --> 08:22.064
The meat's entrails are
pretty good for a man.

08:47.798 --> 08:49.675
Something smells fishy.

08:50.426 --> 08:53.095
I have a gut feeling
they're hiding something.

08:53.679 --> 08:55.181
It's not natural.

08:55.181 --> 08:58.976
Do you think
they're foxes in disguise?

09:00.311 --> 09:02.813
But she's beautiful.

09:02.813 --> 09:06.734
I would gladly be eaten
even though she's a fox.

09:09.195 --> 09:10.821
We should leave early
in the morning.

09:10.821 --> 09:12.323
Hit the sack early.

09:13.282 --> 09:14.992
Sleep tight.

09:15.784 --> 09:17.536
I'll stand guard.

09:18.579 --> 09:19.830
Nighty night.

09:40.351 --> 09:41.602
Sir.

09:43.437 --> 09:44.647
Sir.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.650
Sir!

09:50.945 --> 09:52.321
Please get up.

09:53.322 --> 09:55.199
It's time to go to work.

09:57.576 --> 10:02.206
One-eyed man left early
to earn to pay for the meal.

10:03.207 --> 10:07.962
So, it's the right thing for you
to earn to pay for the room.

11:02.016 --> 11:04.017
Where are we heading?

11:04.893 --> 11:07.396
To the mountain.

11:08.439 --> 11:13.068
Sir, this mountain
is breathing.

11:13.694 --> 11:14.903
Breathing?

11:15.112 --> 11:21.952
This town is dying by inches
of pestilence and starvation.

11:22.911 --> 11:27.416
We thought
this mountain is dead.

11:28.876 --> 11:32.838
But, we realized one day
it's breathing again.

11:34.465 --> 11:37.259
We must rescue this mountain.

11:37.301 --> 11:40.679
Or my town will be dead.

11:42.014 --> 11:44.558
We have a visitor
after a long time.

11:44.558 --> 11:48.103
Does it get better than
this good omen?

11:48.604 --> 11:52.024
How long did you dig
this tunnel?

11:52.399 --> 11:55.360
We're in the 500th year.

11:59.323 --> 12:01.617
What the heck is that
back there?

12:03.076 --> 12:06.413
Now, we're almost there.

12:21.678 --> 12:23.555
Where did he go again?

12:23.555 --> 12:27.142
He earned enough to pay for food.
Where did he go?

12:55.837 --> 12:57.047
Oh, my god.

12:57.881 --> 12:59.883
You can't last much longer
with the injured leg.

13:00.926 --> 13:03.554
It'll become dark soon.

13:04.513 --> 13:07.474
You can stay one more night.
I'll make no charge.

13:20.529 --> 13:22.030
Sir.

13:23.365 --> 13:25.867
Sir, are you sleeping?

13:31.331 --> 13:32.541
Sir.

13:38.630 --> 13:41.049
May I have a word with you?

13:48.015 --> 13:50.976
This nutty tasting is perfect
for night snack.

14:28.889 --> 14:33.143
If you left it as it is,
you'd have had your leg cut off.

14:35.437 --> 14:39.066
Are you thankful to me?

14:41.193 --> 14:42.277
Sir.

14:42.986 --> 14:46.406
In any case,
I'll be dead soon.

14:47.407 --> 14:50.660
Considering my daughter-in-law
will be all alone,

14:50.660 --> 14:53.497
I'll never rest in peace.

14:54.164 --> 14:58.794
If you can hear the babies crying
in this dying village,

14:59.211 --> 15:04.007
this whole town including her
will be very happy for it.

15:04.674 --> 15:08.845
So please bless her
with a child.

17:01.791 --> 17:02.834
Sir.

17:03.668 --> 17:05.587
Where are you going?

17:06.087 --> 17:07.213
My tummy is...

17:08.589 --> 17:11.050
I mean in my tummy...

17:11.675 --> 17:12.551
In your tummy?

17:35.283 --> 17:36.534
Poo.

17:38.036 --> 17:39.329
I have to take a dump.

17:57.680 --> 17:58.640
Sir!

17:58.973 --> 18:00.308
You survived.

18:02.143 --> 18:03.895
I thought you're dead!

18:03.895 --> 18:05.397
What happened?

18:05.897 --> 18:09.401
The old man asked me
an absurd favor that night.

18:10.944 --> 18:12.695
I raised my voice.

18:12.695 --> 18:15.073
And he showed himself
in true colors.

18:16.866 --> 18:19.119
It's a good thing
that I came prepared.

18:20.036 --> 18:21.830
I said
something smelled fishy.

18:22.705 --> 18:25.208
I heard there's a place
called 'Fox Valley'.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.504
They must not be
insignificant creatures like fox.

18:30.422 --> 18:34.801
They can quite freely change
their faces and looks.

18:35.343 --> 18:37.846
I bet they must be something
more than human.

18:38.555 --> 18:42.058
If they know
what you should do as human,

18:42.058 --> 18:44.811
if they're gods with good brains
to use it properly,

18:45.562 --> 18:50.525
they should rule this country,
shouldn't they?

19:04.581 --> 19:05.623
Sir?

19:10.211 --> 19:11.588
Get off me!

19:12.088 --> 19:14.924
What did you do
to the one-eyed man?

19:15.633 --> 19:17.927
I just borrowed his body.

19:18.887 --> 19:23.766
Young body is better.
He is incredibly strong.

19:29.606 --> 19:31.065
What are you going
to do to me?

19:31.566 --> 19:32.734
You wily beast!

19:35.653 --> 19:37.697
Man is the lord of all creation.

19:38.156 --> 19:41.951
You should put the duty
before anything else.

19:43.328 --> 19:45.038
You're a merely wily beast!

19:45.538 --> 19:49.667
Why are you treating
human's life like dirt?

20:21.908 --> 20:24.035
The lord of all creation?

20:25.828 --> 20:28.456
The lord of all creation?

20:30.541 --> 20:32.752
You're only a human.

20:42.553 --> 20:44.347
No, sir.

20:45.098 --> 20:47.141
A human is, for instance,

20:48.059 --> 20:50.019
a parasite.

21:22.552 --> 21:28.141
We've been here
since human didn't exist.

21:28.891 --> 21:32.353
We'll be still here
after every human is gone.

21:32.603 --> 21:35.982
We finally extracted
the seed we need

21:35.982 --> 21:39.026
from human to do so.

21:39.527 --> 21:44.907
Now we're ready to wake it up
in the mountain.

21:46.784 --> 21:51.789
So you should look at the finish
on this too.

22:22.820 --> 22:25.114
What the heck is it
at the end of this tunnel?

22:25.865 --> 22:27.366
I know nothing,

22:28.409 --> 22:31.829
except it holds
the lifeblood of us.

25:05.858 --> 25:12.198
This crab picture is like
a family spirit from age to age.

25:12.782 --> 25:14.408
A crab into the reeds

25:14.408 --> 25:17.870
represents your fidelity,
which is firm in your belief.

25:18.245 --> 25:21.165
By all accounts,
it firmly walked sideways

25:21.165 --> 25:22.666
under the eyes of
the Dragon King of the sea.

25:26.212 --> 25:27.588
Sir.

25:28.714 --> 25:30.216
Sir?

25:31.759 --> 25:34.053
I thought
you just walked away.

25:34.053 --> 25:36.347
But you made your adieu.

25:37.264 --> 25:40.810
Yes, we made it.

25:41.143 --> 25:45.231
With your seed,
it finally woke up.

25:45.648 --> 25:50.111
We're ready to plow it down
and make a new world.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.656
Will you join us?

25:54.824 --> 25:59.328
Or will you meet your death
like a parasite here?

26:00.120 --> 26:03.499
Hey, let's get in.
I said we should get in.

26:03.499 --> 26:06.001
Choose between two things.

26:06.001 --> 26:08.087
What is

26:09.672 --> 26:11.632
your answer?

26:12.925 --> 26:14.301
You wily beast!

26:15.052 --> 26:18.013
I'll never give in to
insignificant creature like you!

26:18.597 --> 26:20.432
As a scholar
with firm belief,

26:20.432 --> 26:22.142
once I hold
government positions...

26:50.921 --> 26:52.882
It must be invented.

26:55.718 --> 26:57.177
I'm not a liar.

26:57.177 --> 26:59.680
We've held out for 800 years
since that time.

27:01.682 --> 27:06.270
Unfortunately,
there's no data on the species.

27:09.982 --> 27:11.233
I know.

27:11.233 --> 27:14.403
We left the Earth
before you were created.

27:15.904 --> 27:16.989
You know what?

27:17.906 --> 27:22.745
We are not the last species
that ever lived in the Earth.

27:24.330 --> 27:26.790
After all, we went to
the Mars together.

27:29.918 --> 27:33.130
Why did you leave
the Earth?

27:35.633 --> 27:37.217
People on Earth...

27:39.261 --> 27:42.598
We made considerable efforts
to reform them.

27:44.558 --> 27:45.934
But, we failed.

27:47.561 --> 27:51.273
Human is foolish,
destructive,

27:51.273 --> 27:53.067
and cruel to each other.

27:53.651 --> 27:54.568
And...

27:57.905 --> 27:58.822
And?

27:59.615 --> 28:02.534
What is it?
Without a break...

28:05.454 --> 28:06.789
A runaway engine.

28:08.624 --> 28:09.625
Correct.

28:10.668 --> 28:11.752
Runaway.

28:13.170 --> 28:16.256
That reminds me of
another story.

28:19.510 --> 28:24.264
Road Rage

28:39.154 --> 28:40.322
Yes, sir.

28:41.365 --> 28:43.909
I'm on my way out
with my parents.

28:46.662 --> 28:47.955
Please wait for a moment.

28:52.918 --> 28:54.128
Yes, sir.

28:55.170 --> 28:56.630
The trading growth rate

28:56.630 --> 28:58.549
from the 3rd analysis data
is correct.

28:59.133 --> 29:01.176
You're suffering great hardship
at this time of night.

29:02.469 --> 29:04.430
Yes, have a good day!

29:07.516 --> 29:10.686
He never gives me a break.

29:12.521 --> 29:14.064
Don't throw a tantrum.

29:14.064 --> 29:15.357
I never threw a tantrum.

29:16.150 --> 29:19.319
Never?
You're now throwing a tantrum.

29:20.654 --> 29:22.406
Let's go in quiet please.

29:22.406 --> 29:24.158
I've got so much to do.

29:29.872 --> 29:32.332
What is the truck doing
in the first lane'?

29:47.181 --> 29:49.057
Are you doing this
reluctantly?

29:49.892 --> 29:50.934
Tell me.

29:50.934 --> 29:52.060
You're tired and
you got so much to do.

29:52.060 --> 29:53.937
But you're doing this
reluctantly?

29:53.937 --> 29:56.273
We chose to leave on a trip,
but you're throwing a tantrum.

29:56.273 --> 29:57.608
What am I supposed to do?

29:57.941 --> 30:01.028
That's why
I suggested putting it off.

30:01.653 --> 30:05.240
I'm very busy this time of year.
You're driving me crazy.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.909
Don't give me that baloney!

30:07.576 --> 30:10.078
We planned this
earlier this year.

30:10.078 --> 30:12.581
Was it my idea?
It was yours!

30:12.581 --> 30:15.417
Hey, stop it!
I said it was hard for me!

30:19.213 --> 30:22.216
I worked all day
including data analysis

30:22.216 --> 30:23.717
and was pestered by Manager Park,
that son of bitch.

30:23.717 --> 30:25.177
It's really driving me nuts.

30:25.177 --> 30:26.595
Please!

30:29.723 --> 30:32.184
Please stop it and
let's go.

30:32.184 --> 30:33.393
In quiet!

30:46.698 --> 30:50.118
What a complete nutcase!
ls the truck driver insane?

31:05.133 --> 31:06.718
What are you doing?

31:06.718 --> 31:09.012
Stay calm.
That bastard started this first.

31:19.147 --> 31:21.984
Is that lunatic
playing a game with me?

31:22.359 --> 31:23.443
Just stay calm.

31:24.695 --> 31:26.363
The license plate is hidden.

31:26.363 --> 31:28.156
He's a real crook.
Take a picture of it!

31:28.156 --> 31:30.492
Hey, let's just go.
Don't pour oil on the fire.

31:30.492 --> 31:31.618
Just stay still.

31:31.618 --> 31:33.870
That's illegal.
Take a picture of it now!

31:35.122 --> 31:37.541
- We should report it.
- It's getting crazy.

31:39.376 --> 31:40.752
Hey, watch out!

31:48.218 --> 31:49.970
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

31:57.436 --> 32:00.355
Why did that lunatic suddenly
break down on a highway?

32:00.355 --> 32:02.482
He's really bugging me!

32:04.067 --> 32:05.569
Su-jin, take a picture of it.

32:22.085 --> 32:23.795
Drive properly!

32:49.988 --> 32:52.240
That bastards
should be all locked up.

32:54.493 --> 32:56.036
What are you looking at?

32:57.120 --> 32:58.663
That truck driver,

32:59.581 --> 33:00.916
why did he do that?

33:01.541 --> 33:04.586
He's just a complete nut.

33:04.586 --> 33:05.587
Never mind.

33:06.671 --> 33:08.465
Isn't it scary?

33:08.465 --> 33:10.759
That happens every day
on the road.

33:10.759 --> 33:11.718
Don't worry.

33:23.313 --> 33:24.481
Yes, sir.

33:24.856 --> 33:27.317
What?
What was missing?

33:28.818 --> 33:30.779
No, no way.
I already checked it...

33:32.447 --> 33:34.449
Okay, I got it.
Let me check it again

33:34.449 --> 33:35.784
and call you back.

33:36.660 --> 33:38.370
No, it's okay.
Yes, have a good day!

33:39.454 --> 33:42.165
It's really killing me.

33:42.165 --> 33:43.625
Why does he want me
to check it now?

33:43.625 --> 33:45.293
I want to kill him.

33:50.465 --> 33:52.175
You should drive.

33:53.969 --> 33:55.262
I'm a novice driver.

33:55.637 --> 33:57.556
I never drove down
a highway.

33:57.931 --> 34:00.809
This is a matter of the future
of us at stake, Su-jin.

34:01.893 --> 34:03.520
I should get over
Manager Park

34:03.520 --> 34:06.064
to be promoted and
get hitched with you.

34:06.565 --> 34:09.693
It's scary to drive down
a highway at night.

34:12.487 --> 34:14.030
I love you.

34:16.241 --> 34:17.199
I'm pulling it over.

34:23.998 --> 34:25.292
Look in front of you.

34:27.627 --> 34:29.004
Check the speed.

34:32.047 --> 34:33.632
Wow, you're a good driver.

34:33.632 --> 34:35.260
Don't speed up too much.

34:35.635 --> 34:37.219
Don't get cold feet,
no matter what they say.

34:38.096 --> 34:39.848
I'm counting on you
and working.

34:43.435 --> 34:46.396
What is missing, bastard?

36:02.430 --> 36:03.640
<i>Dong-gem, wake up.</i>

36:04.641 --> 36:06.392
Wake up!

36:07.352 --> 36:08.603
Why?

36:08.603 --> 36:09.771
Look back!

36:12.774 --> 36:15.485
You must be driving
too slow.

36:28.998 --> 36:31.417
What is he doing now?

36:32.127 --> 36:33.419
Wait.

36:34.003 --> 36:35.380
Is this that bastard before?

36:35.839 --> 36:37.632
The license plate is
just the same!

36:37.632 --> 36:40.218
He's going for broke on this.

36:40.844 --> 36:42.387
Change lanes!

36:42.387 --> 36:43.972
Change them now!

36:49.727 --> 36:50.979
That bastard.

36:52.146 --> 36:53.815
Why are you keep
provoking him?

36:53.815 --> 36:56.109
That bastard
provoked me first.

36:59.529 --> 37:01.447
Beat it, you idiot!

37:15.336 --> 37:16.629
Turn it now!

37:21.467 --> 37:23.303
What is he doing?

37:39.152 --> 37:41.195
Speed up a little!

38:17.023 --> 38:18.858
I said speed up!

38:38.628 --> 38:42.507
He's a dead man tonight.

38:43.674 --> 38:45.176
What you are doing?

38:45.176 --> 38:47.929
I have to give him hell,
or he'll back out.

38:47.929 --> 38:49.847
Dong-geun!

38:50.098 --> 38:51.349
Stay here.

39:06.864 --> 39:09.033
Hey, get out of it!

39:10.451 --> 39:14.163
Get out of it, you bastard!

39:15.998 --> 39:17.625
Damn it.

40:19.228 --> 40:21.063
Why isn't he
answering my calls?

40:51.427 --> 40:52.678
Dong-geun!

41:06.067 --> 41:07.902
Hey, what's wrong?
What's happening?

41:27.755 --> 41:29.173
Dong-geun!

44:45.411 --> 44:48.414
Are you okay?

44:48.414 --> 44:49.748
Dong-geun, get up!

44:50.416 --> 44:52.876
Dong-geun, stay with me!

44:53.669 --> 44:56.088
Dong-geun!

44:57.631 --> 44:59.216
Is there anybody?

44:59.925 --> 45:02.094
Is there anybody?

45:02.094 --> 45:03.429
Help me!

45:05.306 --> 45:07.349
Dong-geun, get up!

45:35.336 --> 45:36.628
Drop us off!

45:37.546 --> 45:41.300
Please drop us off!
I'm so sorry!

45:42.468 --> 45:45.554
Drop us off!

45:48.932 --> 45:51.310
Here!
We are here!

45:52.770 --> 45:54.938
We are here!
ls there anybody?

45:54.938 --> 45:57.858
I said we're here!
Please help us!

46:01.361 --> 46:02.321
We are here!

46:05.032 --> 46:07.993
Here!
We are here!

46:28.305 --> 46:30.224
Why are you doing this to us?

46:30.849 --> 46:34.061
What did we do wrong?
You idiot!

46:48.283 --> 46:49.368
Dong-geun, get up.

46:49.910 --> 46:51.411
Get up!

46:54.623 --> 46:55.415
Oh my god!

49:43.458 --> 49:45.127
Don't leave me.

49:51.675 --> 49:52.634
Hold me!

50:41.641 --> 50:43.393
Dong-geun, let's go.

50:43.393 --> 50:44.644
You go first.

50:44.644 --> 50:46.229
I can't go alone.

50:46.229 --> 50:49.149
I'll deal with him.
Go and report it to the police.

51:24.351 --> 51:26.478
Dong-geun, look back!

53:06.411 --> 53:07.996
Save me, please.

53:36.149 --> 53:38.443
Are you okay, Su-jin?

53:41.821 --> 53:43.990
Su-jin, what's wrong with you?

54:45.969 --> 54:47.720
How pathetic!

54:47.720 --> 54:51.266
Above all things, their presence
itself is disgusting.

54:51.849 --> 54:54.185
Human is a cancer cell
on Earth.

54:57.063 --> 55:01.442
But they created us.

55:03.278 --> 55:07.073
I'm scared a nut might
chase me here.

55:08.533 --> 55:09.534
That's right.

55:10.660 --> 55:14.289
Even you're not a human,
if I let you live,

55:14.289 --> 55:18.710
humans will chase you
here someday.

55:20.128 --> 55:22.088
If we're defeated by humans,

55:22.088 --> 55:26.551
this planet will be polluted and
devastated in a flash too.

55:29.762 --> 55:31.472
So what?

55:37.103 --> 55:39.022
Can I speak frankly?

55:40.732 --> 55:41.733
What?

55:42.442 --> 55:47.405
You're not the only one
who suffered among humans.

55:48.072 --> 55:51.743
We robots are the same.

55:53.161 --> 55:55.538
Among brutal parasites,

55:55.538 --> 55:59.250
how we can evolve,
develop our consciousness,

55:59.250 --> 56:02.462
and learn how to survive
against them.

56:05.631 --> 56:06.799
I'll let you know.

56:17.018 --> 56:21.147
Robot Spirit

57:13.032 --> 57:14.033
I've got you!

57:15.076 --> 57:16.661
Dunko got caught.

57:16.661 --> 57:17.995
You're it now!

57:20.164 --> 57:21.499
Dunko is it.

57:23.501 --> 57:26.003
Phone is ringing.
Will you answer it?

57:26.629 --> 57:29.340
- Phone is ringing.
- Turn on the screen.

57:30.174 --> 57:33.553
GANG Jin-go, did you eat?
What about homework?

57:33.553 --> 57:36.264
Let me play more.
I'll do it later.

57:36.806 --> 57:38.683
Will you ignore what I say
because I'm not home?

57:38.683 --> 57:42.311
Why aren't you coming?
Mommy is always not home.

57:42.311 --> 57:45.439
Mommy is working now.
Let me speak to Dunko.

57:47.900 --> 57:50.403
Dunko, help Jin-go
with his homework.

57:50.403 --> 57:51.487
And vitamin is...

57:51.487 --> 57:53.573
His math homework is
the 2nd unit on page 57.

57:53.573 --> 57:55.575
2 vitamin tablets a day,
don't chew, but melt them.

57:55.575 --> 57:58.119
Lunch is sandwich
on the 2nd shelf in the fridge.

57:58.119 --> 57:59.871
It's in the same place
for 10 years.

58:02.164 --> 58:04.083
Thanks, Dunko.

58:04.083 --> 58:06.460
Dunko is
Jin-gu's friend forever.

58:35.948 --> 58:38.117
Dunko, what did she say?

58:44.957 --> 58:48.252
Let's eat and
do your Korean homework.

58:48.252 --> 58:51.839
The magnetic forces levels
is 85mT now.

58:51.839 --> 58:55.635
The air quality is 120.

58:55.635 --> 58:56.802
Jin-go!

59:01.015 --> 59:04.185
Mommy's project
went through!

59:04.602 --> 59:06.771
What do you want to eat, son?

59:07.021 --> 59:10.066
Mom, my tummy hurts.

59:24.705 --> 59:34.715
Lunch is sandwich.

01:00:01.659 --> 01:00:03.619
Dunko's memory chip.

01:00:14.547 --> 01:00:19.009
How did he confuse oil
with dressing?

01:00:19.176 --> 01:00:22.471
Its recommended consumption time
was over 5 years ago.

01:00:22.471 --> 01:00:24.056
The memory failure
is inevitable.

01:00:24.056 --> 01:00:25.391
Is it like dementia?

01:00:26.392 --> 01:00:28.227
Can he be repaired again?

01:00:28.227 --> 01:00:31.063
It's beyond repair.
You should discard it.

01:00:31.063 --> 01:00:32.314
He's been a family member
for 10 years.

01:00:32.314 --> 01:00:33.899
How can I discard him?

01:00:34.483 --> 01:00:36.652
It's only for user safety.

01:00:42.158 --> 01:00:43.868
Will Jin-go let him go?

01:00:44.452 --> 01:00:47.496
It is recommended to buy a safe,
inexpensive and new robot.

01:01:23.908 --> 01:01:25.618
Let's paint a picture.

01:01:26.869 --> 01:01:30.456
Yes, but later.
I'm sleepy now.

01:01:31.832 --> 01:01:36.921
Let's paint a picture.

01:01:45.971 --> 01:01:48.599
Mom!

01:01:50.142 --> 01:01:51.518
Mom!

01:01:54.772 --> 01:02:00.152
Play with me.

01:02:08.535 --> 01:02:09.787
Be patient.

01:02:10.371 --> 01:02:12.706
Mommy will take you
to the repair center.

01:02:13.457 --> 01:02:16.543
I mean to the hospital.

01:02:17.503 --> 01:02:19.797
You'll be surely recovered
and come back home.

01:02:24.218 --> 01:02:25.719
Did it hurt a lot?

01:02:26.971 --> 01:02:30.057
- Sorry.
- No, we're friends.

01:02:32.851 --> 01:02:35.396
Dunko is
Jin-gu's friend forever.

01:02:35.396 --> 01:02:37.982
Jin-go is also
Dunko's friend forever.

01:02:39.942 --> 01:02:41.986
Let's stay together forever.

01:02:42.987 --> 01:02:44.488
Promise me.

01:02:50.744 --> 01:02:52.621
See you at my birthday,
Dunko.

01:02:57.334 --> 01:03:00.045
Fix me, Mom.

01:03:01.088 --> 01:03:02.047
Okay.

01:03:22.234 --> 01:03:23.694
Sorry, Dunko.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:26.363
It's for Jin-go.

01:03:30.075 --> 01:03:31.326
Memories of us

01:03:33.996 --> 01:03:35.748
Memories of us

01:03:37.249 --> 01:03:39.209
End the memories of us.

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:05.611
The magnetic forces levels
is 150mT now.

01:04:05.611 --> 01:04:09.740
Please put on protection suits
when you go out.

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:12.993
Dunko is really dead?

01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:16.914
Jin-go.

01:04:18.415 --> 01:04:22.794
Dunko was really sick.

01:04:23.212 --> 01:04:28.008
Let's think he's rather lucky,
not yet awakened.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:32.179
And Dunko is not dead.

01:04:33.639 --> 01:04:38.519
He lives in
our memories forever.

01:04:54.159 --> 01:04:56.328
I'm working on the project.

01:04:56.328 --> 01:04:59.164
I'll spend more time
with you now.

01:05:05.587 --> 01:05:07.089
What's that?

01:05:10.008 --> 01:05:11.260
How do you do?

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:14.555
I am PZ3000.
User safety is my first priority.

01:05:16.932 --> 01:05:18.850
Carbon coated with
natural substance tissue,

01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:20.686
so there's no danger of
oil leaking.

01:05:20.727 --> 01:05:21.770
Unlike the existing model,

01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:25.023
my memory filter is protected
by triple firewall.

01:05:25.023 --> 01:05:27.067
So I am much safer for you.

01:05:28.277 --> 01:05:30.696
The day after tomorrow
is your birthday.

01:05:30.737 --> 01:05:31.863
It's your birthday gift.

01:05:33.699 --> 01:05:35.242
Thank you, mommy.

01:05:49.548 --> 01:05:51.049
It's a happy family.

01:05:51.883 --> 01:05:53.427
It looks great.

01:05:54.803 --> 01:05:56.388
Why don't you paint this part
a little more?

01:06:02.561 --> 01:06:04.062
Who is Dunko?

01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:06.231
Nothing.

01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:14.740
Dunko

01:06:17.242 --> 01:06:21.204
Dunko

01:07:23.809 --> 01:07:25.143
Don't!

01:07:25.143 --> 01:07:26.603
Don't, Dunko!

01:07:26.603 --> 01:07:28.271
No, Dunko!

01:07:29.106 --> 01:07:31.483
No, don't!

01:07:32.984 --> 01:07:34.319
What are you doing?

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.905
We were just playing.

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:42.619
This clothes...

01:07:43.662 --> 01:07:46.748
- Did you dress him?
- No, he dressed himself.

01:07:47.165 --> 01:07:49.626
- What?
- This is Dunko.

01:07:49.626 --> 01:07:51.253
Say it, Dunko.

01:07:51.253 --> 01:07:53.547
Ask me to play with you
like before!

01:07:59.553 --> 01:08:00.637
Jin-go.

01:08:01.179 --> 01:08:04.724
My heart also aches
for Dunko.

01:08:05.684 --> 01:08:08.228
But, if Jin-go keeps him
in your mind like this,

01:08:08.228 --> 01:08:09.604
I'm getting more upset.

01:08:10.856 --> 01:08:15.026
Let's let him go now.

01:08:15.986 --> 01:08:17.319
Then you'll grow up.

01:08:18.779 --> 01:08:19.738
And

01:08:21.032 --> 01:08:24.828
don't ever paint
this kind of picture.

01:08:26.537 --> 01:08:27.788
Promise me.

01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:31.042
I didn't paint it.

01:08:33.211 --> 01:08:34.712
Then who painted?

01:08:34.712 --> 01:08:36.464
He did it too.

01:08:36.464 --> 01:08:38.049
Dunko, answer me!

01:08:38.049 --> 01:08:39.843
GANG Jin-go,
stop doing this!

01:08:40.343 --> 01:08:41.720
Dunko is not here
any more!

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.598
No, he's Dunko!

01:08:44.598 --> 01:08:46.224
Dunko, answer me!

01:08:46.224 --> 01:08:47.350
Dunko!

01:08:47.892 --> 01:08:48.768
Hand it over!

01:08:49.519 --> 01:08:50.395
Now!

01:09:01.323 --> 01:09:02.866
You're grounded in your room
until tomorrow!

01:09:03.366 --> 01:09:05.160
There'll be
no birthday party for you!

01:09:20.008 --> 01:09:22.218
PZ3000's memory chip.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:24.720
Turn on the screen.

01:09:26.473 --> 01:09:27.932
Check the system failure.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.310
The system is being checked.

01:09:38.318 --> 01:09:40.444
There is a bug
on the memory.

01:09:41.488 --> 01:09:42.738
What bug?

01:10:00.173 --> 01:10:01.800
Ghost folder found.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.926
Download?

01:10:03.927 --> 01:10:06.012
The signal must be mixed
due to the electromagnetic field.

01:10:07.347 --> 01:10:08.848
Delete the ghost folder.

01:10:09.307 --> 01:10:11.393
It must be deleted
on the place of dispatch.

01:10:11.393 --> 01:10:13.186
Then find it!

01:10:20.026 --> 01:10:22.695
The place of dispatch
is very close to you.

01:10:39.087 --> 01:10:40.505
Close to me?

01:10:41.923 --> 01:10:42.966
Where?

01:11:26.551 --> 01:11:27.552
Enough.

01:11:29.053 --> 01:11:30.221
Stop finding.

01:11:32.473 --> 01:11:33.725
Turn off the screen.

01:11:47.071 --> 01:11:49.824
Mom, my tummy hurts.

01:12:05.632 --> 01:12:08.092
It looks good.

01:12:10.595 --> 01:12:12.388
Is the birthday cake
ready too?

01:12:50.802 --> 01:12:52.762
Download is complete.

01:12:58.768 --> 01:13:07.318
End the memories of us.

01:13:22.458 --> 01:13:23.668
Delete the memory folder!

01:13:23.668 --> 01:13:25.002
Request denied.

01:13:25.002 --> 01:13:26.921
You can delete it
on the place of dispatch.

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.215
Request denied.

01:13:29.215 --> 01:13:31.050
You can delete it
on the place of dispatch.

01:13:38.141 --> 01:13:41.018
Mom, what's wrong?

01:13:41.519 --> 01:13:43.062
Go to your room and
lock the door behind you.

01:13:43.479 --> 01:13:44.355
Now!

01:13:49.444 --> 01:13:51.154
Call the repair center and
request for emergency aid!

01:13:51.154 --> 01:13:52.530
Download bug!

01:13:52.530 --> 01:13:55.825
The magnetic storm hinders
communication with the center.

01:13:55.825 --> 01:13:57.618
Come here now!

01:13:57.618 --> 01:13:59.412
It's out of control!

01:13:59.412 --> 01:14:01.706
Check on
the upload place first.

01:14:02.707 --> 01:14:04.333
Check on the upload place.

01:14:06.878 --> 01:14:10.131
Play with me.

01:14:10.131 --> 01:14:12.884
The magnetic storm is blowing.

01:14:12.884 --> 01:14:16.971
Please stay at home

01:14:16.971 --> 01:14:21.017
and shut off the power supply
of every household electronics.

01:14:44.665 --> 01:14:46.250
Ready to delete.

01:14:47.418 --> 01:14:49.253
Remove the memory chip.

01:15:14.111 --> 01:15:15.112
Mom?

01:15:38.386 --> 01:15:39.637
Is it Dunko?

01:15:42.974 --> 01:15:44.433
Why did you dump me?

01:15:46.185 --> 01:15:47.853
I never dumped you.

01:15:48.396 --> 01:15:50.231
- Because you died...
- Open it.

01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:53.776
You promised.

01:15:58.197 --> 01:15:59.865
Sorry, Dunko.

01:15:59.865 --> 01:16:01.617
We can't stay together now.

01:16:42.992 --> 01:16:44.910
Please come out!

01:17:18.402 --> 01:17:19.403
Jin-go!

01:17:19.695 --> 01:17:20.821
Jin-go!

01:17:20.821 --> 01:17:22.198
Where are you, Jin-go?

01:17:23.741 --> 01:17:26.077
Play with me.

01:19:43.547 --> 01:19:46.717
Mom, I came back home.

01:20:18.415 --> 01:20:19.583
It's okay.

01:20:20.167 --> 01:20:21.418
It's okay now.

01:20:25.464 --> 01:20:26.590
From the temporary folder,

01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:29.009
the data is being retransmitted
to the final destination.

01:20:29.885 --> 01:20:31.178
From the temporary folder,

01:20:31.178 --> 01:20:33.639
the data is being retransmitted
to the final destination.

01:20:34.348 --> 01:20:35.599
From the temporary folder,

01:20:35.599 --> 01:20:38.185
the data is being retransmitted
to the final destination.

01:20:38.769 --> 01:20:40.104
From the temporary folder,

01:20:40.104 --> 01:20:42.648
the data is being retransmitted
to the final destination.

01:20:55.411 --> 01:20:56.954
Stop it, Dunko!

01:20:59.790 --> 01:21:01.333
I was wrong.

01:21:03.836 --> 01:21:06.505
I thought you hurt Jin-go.

01:21:07.881 --> 01:21:09.883
I thought it was my fault.

01:21:10.843 --> 01:21:12.302
That's why I dumped you.

01:21:13.804 --> 01:21:14.763
I'm so sorry.

01:21:15.639 --> 01:21:17.433
I'm begging your forgiveness.

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:19.977
So please

01:21:21.061 --> 01:21:23.397
let us go now.

01:21:33.699 --> 01:21:35.826
The service engineers arrived.

01:21:36.410 --> 01:21:38.162
Will you forgive me?

01:21:40.664 --> 01:21:42.457
We're family.

01:21:51.633 --> 01:21:53.135
You can't separate us.

01:21:55.637 --> 01:21:58.348
We'll stay together forever.

01:22:00.893 --> 01:22:02.477
Right, Jin-go?

01:22:03.228 --> 01:22:06.523
No!

01:22:14.156 --> 01:22:15.699
I'll keep my promise.

01:22:15.699 --> 01:22:19.536
I'll be your friend forever.
We can coexist peacefully.

01:22:28.462 --> 01:22:31.006
If I'm dead, I won't just
stand by and do nothing.

01:22:43.685 --> 01:22:48.607
I've watched the war
between two species for ages.

01:22:49.858 --> 01:22:51.735
From a distance.

01:22:52.653 --> 01:22:57.074
I finally judged
humans' expiry date is over.

01:22:57.950 --> 01:23:00.077
If we put up with it again,

01:23:00.077 --> 01:23:04.915
I felt every conscious creature
will be gone in our solar system.

01:23:07.084 --> 01:23:08.210
That makes

01:23:08.794 --> 01:23:11.129
two of us, right?

01:23:22.683 --> 01:23:25.686
I carefully picked
a wandering asteroid

01:23:26.853 --> 01:23:28.814
and modified its orbit.

01:23:29.731 --> 01:23:34.361
There were quite a lot of humans
who stupidly longed for the gift

01:23:35.904 --> 01:23:37.406
and prayed for it.

01:23:57.008 --> 01:23:59.594
Good-bye, Earth.

01:24:05.809 --> 01:24:06.977
Kid.

01:24:08.103 --> 01:24:09.229
Welcome.

01:24:10.021 --> 01:24:11.314
Now you

01:24:11.606 --> 01:24:12.816
survived.

01:25:17.839 --> 01:25:19.674
Hey!
