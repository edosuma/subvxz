coming, Balki?

01:27.688 --> 01:29.389
Oh, it’s coming along real good.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.528
Well, paint me gold
and call me Oscar.

01:36.663 --> 01:39.465
I thought you said you’d never
eat Myposian food again

01:39.499 --> 01:41.602
after you found out
I make my shoo‐fly pie

01:41.635 --> 01:43.269

Oh, Larry,
I have to talk to you.

02:22.275 --> 02:23.409
Well, Jennifer, what’s wrong?

02:23.443 --> 02:25.679
I have terrible news.

02:25.712 --> 02:28.348
My mother’s coming to town
and she wants to meet you.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.287
Well, Jennifer,
I’d love to meet your mother.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.689
But, Larry,
you don’t understand.

02:35.722 --> 02:37.758
Mother doesn’t think
anyone is good enough for me.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.660
Well, then
she’ll like Cousin Larry.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.728
He don’t think he’s
good enough for you either.

02:44.264 --> 02:45.866
‐Balki, you’re not helping.
‐What?

02:45.899 --> 02:47.968
Larry, I’d marry you even
if mother didn’t like you

02:48.001 --> 02:49.603
but it would be
so much better if she did.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.772
Then I wouldn’t have to
defend you all the time.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.306
Jennifer, don’t worry.

02:58.945 --> 03:01.281
I’m the most wonderful guy
in the world

03:01.314 --> 03:03.483
then we’ll be married
and the truth won’t matter.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.388
Well, you’re right.

03:08.421 --> 03:10.691
I mean, what was I
so worried about?

03:10.724 --> 03:14.595
Oh, Larry, what could mother
possibly find wrong with you?

03:14.628 --> 03:17.564
I mean, you’re not at all like
the other men I used to date.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.365
You’re not always stopping
to sign autographs

03:19.399 --> 03:20.867

03:20.901 --> 03:24.370
Not always being called away
like the heart surgeon.

03:24.404 --> 03:25.839
Not always being summoned
to the White House

03:25.872 --> 03:26.973
like the Congressman.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.475
He’s not always lugging
that Heisman trophy around

03:29.510 --> 03:30.777

03:33.714 --> 03:35.882
Oh, Larry, I feel much better.

Now, don’t worry.
Your mother is gonna love me.

03:51.297 --> 03:53.499
‐Why did you do that?
‐Cousin, I had no choice.

always end.

03:55.301 --> 03:56.970

of what your life would be like.

You get hysterical,
you start to diaper‐ventilate

04:02.743 --> 04:04.444
and then who has to slap you

04:04.477 --> 04:05.712
and just bring you
back to reality?

04:05.746 --> 04:06.813
I do.

04:09.015 --> 04:10.917

dangling over there

04:10.951 --> 04:12.553

04:12.586 --> 04:14.888
Balki, don’t you see
what’s happening here?

04:14.921 --> 04:16.790
Cousin, don’t make me do this.

04:16.822 --> 04:19.760
Balki, her mother hated
a big‐league ball player.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.762
I didn’t get a hit in three
years of Little League!

04:21.795 --> 04:22.829
Cousin, I’m gonna...
Just don’t make me do this.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.497

04:36.743 --> 04:38.311
You’re right, I shoulda listened

04:38.344 --> 04:40.046

the first time.

why he’s never around

Well, then
you’re in for a treat.

Jennifer’s mother is coming
to town earlier than expected

06:05.732 --> 06:08.068

has to have dinner with them

06:08.101 --> 06:09.736
tonight instead of Thursday

06:09.770 --> 06:12.839
and I‐I hope
he don’t get too upset.

to change very well.

any kind of Sports Department

to American Gladiators.

in Madison, Wisconsin.

You live in this apartment.

You work at
the Chicago Chronicle

10:00.366 --> 10:02.803
and, when you think
no one is listening

10:02.836 --> 10:05.205
you gargle
to the tune of "Moon River."

10:05.238 --> 10:07.808
I gargle
to the tune of "Moon River?"

10:07.841 --> 10:09.375
Yeah.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.177
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.413
I think I’m starting
to remember do we...

10:13.446 --> 10:15.415
Do we work with
a man named, named

This is wonderful.

Oh, boy, I... I must have
taken quite a spill?

10:55.288 --> 10:56.757
Huh, for a minute there, I could

10:56.790 --> 10:58.892
I couldn’t remember anything.

10:58.925 --> 11:02.395
Oh, born in Madison,
I work at the Chronicle.

11:02.428 --> 11:05.231
Gargle to "Moon River."
Heh‐heh, it’s all back.

is one amazing little gizmo.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.324
You’ve lost it again.

Who are you?

11:36.096 --> 11:38.464
Is there some reason you’re
dressed like the Cisco Kid?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.739
I’m trying to make
a fashion statement.

11:47.841 --> 11:51.011
But quite clearly
it’s wasted on you.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.946
Well, I’m sorry if
I insulted you but uh, I

11:52.979 --> 11:55.849
I‐I don’t remember who I am.

11:55.882 --> 11:56.983
And I don’t know if I ever will.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.985
Now, cousin, just don’t worry

11:59.019 --> 12:00.353
the doctor said that your memory

12:00.386 --> 12:02.856
might go away and come back
a few times before

12:02.889 --> 12:04.124
you get it back for good.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.826
He said it happens all the time

12:05.859 --> 12:08.128
to people testifying before
congressional committees.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.465
I’m testifying before congress?

12:12.498 --> 12:14.067
‐No, No, No, No.
‐What have I done?

12:14.100 --> 12:15.468
‐Just calm down, calm down.
‐What did I do?

12:15.502 --> 12:16.970
Calm down.

Oh, God.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.367

12:49.035 --> 12:52.105
Okay, you were born

12:52.138 --> 12:53.907
in Madison, Wisconsin.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.976
I, I work

I, I was born in
Madison Wisconsin

13:25.438 --> 13:27.373
I work at the Chronicle

13:27.407 --> 13:29.209
how many girls I asked
to the senior prom. 12.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.012
And I remember
how many turned me down.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.080
Thirteen.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.882
One girl just came right up to
me in the cafeteria and said

13:35.916 --> 13:37.984
"Don’t even think
of asking me to the prom."

13:44.157 --> 13:46.593
A, a little unnecessary,
don’t you think?

13:48.328 --> 13:50.463
Well, she might
have had a good reason.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.166
Were you eating at the time?

13:53.199 --> 13:56.102
I was merely using that story
to illustrate the fact

13:56.136 --> 13:58.505
that I remember
every detail of my life.

13:58.539 --> 13:59.472
Well, that’s good, cousin.

Balki, please, I am fine.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.912
I have had my memory

the back of your tongue.

Balki, please.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.699
Now, look, just
don’t tell Jennifer anything

14:58.732 --> 15:01.001

She‐she’d only worry.

So, just please,
don’t tell her anything.

Alright, alright,
I won’t tell her anything.

Oh. God! I’ve got to
get you out of here.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.350
Larry, what are you
doing out here?

15:17.383 --> 15:18.451
Mother’s waiting
to meet you.

Well.

If she’s anything like you

Larry, what’s going on here?

15:32.498 --> 15:35.536
Uh, Jennifer, I hate to be
the wearer of bad news

15:35.569 --> 15:37.437
but Cousin Larry
had an accident today.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.706
He fall down the stairs,
he bonk his head

15:39.740 --> 15:42.408
and‐and then he lose his memory
and then it come back

15:42.442 --> 15:44.377
but every time he needs it
it goes away again.

15:46.412 --> 15:47.480
Larry, are you alright?

15:47.514 --> 15:48.549
Well, I’m fine.

15:48.582 --> 15:50.651
Now, what do you say

15:50.684 --> 15:51.685
and get to know each other.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.990
Larry, we do know each other.
We’re engaged.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.194
‐You’re gonna marry me?
‐Yes.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.196
Balki, if mother sees
Larry in this condition

16:03.229 --> 16:05.065
she’ll never approve
of me marrying him.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.667
You’re gonna marry me?

16:06.700 --> 16:08.001
Maybe.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.005
What am I gonna tell mother?

16:12.038 --> 16:13.173
Well, you just tell her that

16:13.206 --> 16:14.608
Cousin Larry had an accident.

16:14.641 --> 16:18.011
He fall down the stairs, he bonk
his head, he lose his memory

16:18.044 --> 16:20.547
and now he don’t know who he is
from a hole in the ground.

16:20.581 --> 16:22.348
The truth always works.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.250
Not this time,
I used the amnesia excuse

16:24.284 --> 16:26.186

old boyfriends.

Well, wait a minute.
We need your mother’s approval?

16:28.789 --> 16:30.624
‐Yes.
‐Well, we can make this work.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.025
I have a plan.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.462
Well, this could work!
I’ll, I’ll just make small talk.

wants to know something about me

16:38.431 --> 16:39.566
uh, you and Balki
can tell her.

‐Excuse me, excuse me‐‐
‐We’ll just... We’ll, uh‐‐

16:41.167 --> 16:42.202
‐We’ll, uh‐‐
‐Excuse me, Balki.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.437
‐My name is Balki.
‐Whatever.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.640
Listen, the point is
we can make this work.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.542
It’s worth a shot!
Come on!

16:48.575 --> 16:49.610
Oh!

16:51.177 --> 16:52.813
Alright, now,
remember Blakely...

16:52.846 --> 16:55.516
‐Balki.
‐When we... Yeah, whatever.

16:55.549 --> 16:57.250
If I get stuck for a fact,
you just jump right in

16:57.283 --> 16:58.351
and then give me the answer.

16:58.384 --> 16:59.352
But‐but don’t make it obvious.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.054
You know, try to
lead me to the right answer.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.088
You think you can handle that?

17:02.122 --> 17:04.558
I’m the one with
the fully‐functioning brain.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.165
Guys, this is my mother,
Catherine Lyons.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.067
‐Mother, this is Larry.
‐Hello.

17:14.099 --> 17:16.269
‐I’m delighted to meet you.
‐Thank you.

17:16.301 --> 17:17.804
And this is Balki,
Larry’s cousin.

17:17.838 --> 17:19.105
Hello.

17:25.546 --> 17:27.748
Isn’t that nice,
he brought his cousin with him.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.384
We go everywhere together.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.086
We’re insufferable.

17:40.426 --> 17:44.497

so much about you, Mrs, uh...

forget his own name

if I hadn’t sewn it
into his underwear.

18:05.686 --> 18:07.588

18:07.621 --> 18:09.355
Of course he’s exaggerating.

Larry, stop joking.

18:25.205 --> 18:28.341
Mother will think you’re not
serious about marrying me.

18:28.374 --> 18:31.377
Serious?
Well, of course I’m serious.

18:31.411 --> 18:34.147
Who wouldn’t want to marry
a woman as lovely as Jessica?

18:34.180 --> 18:35.248
‐Jennifer.
‐Jennifer.

‐Could we have some menus?
‐Yes, sir.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.738
I hear the food here
is very good.

18:57.771 --> 19:00.206
Tell me, Larry, do you enjoy
working for the paper?

19:01.608 --> 19:03.243
And what paper
would that be?

19:05.512 --> 19:07.514
Uh, Cousin Larry

19:07.548 --> 19:10.551
loves working
at the Chicago...

19:10.584 --> 19:11.885
Stockyards.

19:14.821 --> 19:18.258
You know very well that you
work at the Chicago Chronicle.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.226
How many years
have you been there?

19:20.260 --> 19:22.796
‐Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh...
‐Uh, uh,

19:23.997 --> 19:25.231
Would you care for an olive?

19:25.265 --> 19:26.767
‐No, thanks,
‐Sweet gherkin?

19:26.800 --> 19:28.869
‐Not really.
‐Try the baby corn.

19:28.902 --> 19:30.904
Take three ears.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.339
Three ears.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.243
Take three ears.

19:40.581 --> 19:41.815
‐Uh, three years!
‐Uh!

19:41.848 --> 19:45.251
Three years. I’ve worked at
the Chronicle for three years.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.287
Uh, waiter!

19:47.320 --> 19:49.255
Could we have some menus?

19:49.289 --> 19:51.391

‐Oh.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.402
Mrs. Lyons, I know
you’re concerned that...

20:02.435 --> 20:03.604
‐Jennifer.
‐...marries happily.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.541
And I just want you
to know that I intend

20:07.574 --> 20:09.976
to devote the rest
of my life to making...

20:10.010 --> 20:11.477
‐Jennifer.
‐...happy.

20:13.847 --> 20:15.849
That’s very reassuring.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.884
Now, why don’t we
all try and relax

20:17.918 --> 20:19.853
and have
a wonderful dinner, hmm?

20:19.886 --> 20:22.589
Well, I think
that’s a great idea.

20:24.825 --> 20:26.960
Hello.

20:26.993 --> 20:30.363
My name is
Cousin Larry Appleton.

20:32.498 --> 20:33.900
Uh, waiter?

20:33.934 --> 20:35.636
Could we get some menus?

20:35.669 --> 20:36.670
Oh!

20:39.339 --> 20:40.541
Have we met?

20:42.375 --> 20:44.310
[instrumental music]

20:52.586 --> 20:55.522
And I’ve‐I’ve worked at
the Chronicle for three years.

20:55.556 --> 20:57.791
Oh, cousin, it looks like
you’ve got everything back.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.794
Yeah, everything except what
happened from when I fell down

21:00.827 --> 21:02.328
the stairs at the Chronicle

21:02.362 --> 21:03.897
to when Jennifer’s mother

21:03.930 --> 21:05.532
stormed out of the restaurant.

21:05.566 --> 21:06.567
[knock on door]

21:13.006 --> 21:15.075
Jennifer. Uh‐uhh, Mrs. Lyons.

21:15.108 --> 21:18.444
Larry, I explained everything
to mother and she understands.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.680
Y‐you do?

21:19.713 --> 21:21.582
Well, uh, uh, sort of.

21:21.615 --> 21:24.618
Jennifer told me about
your temporary amnesia

21:24.651 --> 21:28.354
and that seemed to explain
most of your bizarre behavior.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.591
I mean,
you seem pleasant enough.

21:30.624 --> 21:31.825
You have a decent job

21:31.858 --> 21:34.494
and there’s
a certain desperation

21:34.528 --> 21:37.030
in your eyes that tells me

21:37.063 --> 21:39.966
you will never leave
my daughter.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.434
Welcome to the family.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.304
Thanks, mom.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.807
Call me Mrs. Lyons.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.044
Good news. Uh...

21:51.077 --> 21:53.413
After Jennifer marries
Cousin Larry then

21:53.446 --> 21:56.016
then you will be my
aunt‐in‐law five times removed.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.853
My livestock will be
your livestock.

22:03.857 --> 22:05.391
Oh, my!

22:09.630 --> 22:11.665
I’m so glad
everything worked out.

22:11.698 --> 22:14.067

Bye, Larry.

Jennifer, are you sure
about this marriage?

I’m sure.

living with you, will he?

22:44.898 --> 22:46.533
Have we met?
