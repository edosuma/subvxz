for coming to my office.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.388
It just, it seems like
there's a little issue

15:45.412 --> 15:47.056
with the transcript, but...

15:47.080 --> 15:48.624
No, no. That's gonna scare him.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.360
Okay, Eric, we're just gonna...

15:51.384 --> 15:54.998
I'm gonna help you
do whatever...

15:55.022 --> 15:56.165
Shit!

15:56.189 --> 15:58.901
Okay, um, let's be best friends.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.527
Oh, God, really?

16:49.076 --> 16:50.553
- [door opens]
- Uh...

16:50.577 --> 16:52.121
What are you doing?

16:52.145 --> 16:54.257
Why do you have a picture
of my parents in here?

16:54.281 --> 16:58.227
We went to high... We went
to high school together.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.419
Okay.

17:02.789 --> 17:06.734
- What's that list?
- It's none of your business.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.661
It's a little bit creepy.

17:10.329 --> 17:13.742
You have no right to
go through my stuff.

17:13.766 --> 17:17.337
You think you can do
whatever you want.

17:19.172 --> 17:22.984
The whole world bows
down to Eric Schultz.

17:23.009 --> 17:27.955
Um... maybe I should go.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.449
Fine. Don't graduate.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.162
What?

17:33.186 --> 17:35.922
What? Um...

17:39.025 --> 17:41.104
Yes.

17:41.128 --> 17:46.175
Okay, um, you are set to
graduate in two months.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.677
But in order to graduate,

17:48.701 --> 17:51.447
one must pass all of
one's required courses.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.316
I have a 3.9.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.952
Of the classes you took.

17:56.976 --> 17:59.822
You didn't take Humanities
your freshman year.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.524
Humanities? Wait. Hold on.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.293
No one ever told me I needed
to take Humanities, ever.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.619
Okay, so...

18:12.525 --> 18:14.561
Shit.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.507
What do I do?

18:18.531 --> 18:23.112
Well, you could take the class
when it's offered next,

18:23.136 --> 18:25.047
which would be in the fall,

18:25.071 --> 18:27.216
which would make you
graduate at Christmas.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.785
No way. I need to graduate now.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.655
Eric, you're...

18:32.679 --> 18:35.148
you're not going to graduate.

18:37.016 --> 18:38.694
Okay.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.963
Look, there's gotta be
some way around this.

18:40.987 --> 18:44.867
Right, I mean, because
for people like you,

18:44.891 --> 18:48.261
there's always a way around
things, isn't there?

18:50.197 --> 18:51.874
You own this school.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.509
What are you talking about?

18:53.533 --> 18:55.268
Did I do something to you?

18:59.439 --> 19:01.150
Do you wanna know
what's on this list?

19:01.174 --> 19:03.219
Sure.

19:03.243 --> 19:06.088
This is a list of things I was
never able to do in high school

19:06.112 --> 19:08.424
because I wasn't...

19:08.448 --> 19:11.260
I wasn't popular enough

19:11.284 --> 19:14.497
or pretty enough,

19:14.521 --> 19:15.788
cool enough.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.737
This list would be so
easy for people like you.

19:21.761 --> 19:26.875
Look, I'm sorry that
your high school sucked.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.545
I am. I'm just...

19:29.569 --> 19:31.380
I need to figure out
how to graduate here.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.048
So, I mean, you're the
guidance counselor.

19:33.072 --> 19:35.775
Can you please just tell
me what I need to do?

19:38.878 --> 19:40.789
The list.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.615
What about the list?

19:44.384 --> 19:48.531
You could help me
complete the list.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.223
Here.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.604
I think you'd be arrested

19:55.628 --> 19:57.373
if you tried to do half
the things on here.

19:57.397 --> 20:02.311
I'm not gonna be the one
doing these things, Eric.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.612
You are.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.482
What?

20:06.506 --> 20:08.284
No! I...

20:08.308 --> 20:11.654
That's just... weird.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.656
It's not.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.114
It's not weird.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.464
Help me complete this list,

20:21.488 --> 20:23.666
and I will make
sure you graduate.

20:23.690 --> 20:26.602
No! You know what?
This is blackmail!

20:26.626 --> 20:29.171
I'll just go talk to
Principal Cameron.

20:29.195 --> 20:30.773
You know, fine, fine. Talk
to Principal Cameron.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.308
I'm sure he'll be very
interested to know

20:32.332 --> 20:34.410
that you didn't take
your Humanities class.

20:34.434 --> 20:37.012
If I tell him what you just
said to me, you'll be fired.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.938
And you will graduate
at Christmas.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.300
You guys are here.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.802
Somebody... die?

20:59.826 --> 21:02.137
Mm! We're celebrating.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.472
Celebrating what?

21:03.496 --> 21:06.542
Our divorce papers
were final today.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.644
What does that mean?

21:08.668 --> 21:12.381
Is one of you guys
gonna move out?

21:12.405 --> 21:14.483
No. Of course not!

21:14.507 --> 21:17.653
[laughs] What would people say?

21:17.677 --> 21:21.156
Dad, are you okay?

21:21.180 --> 21:23.158
- Pass the vegetables.
- Why don't you hurry up now

21:23.182 --> 21:25.294
'cause we're gonna be
late for the benefit.

21:25.318 --> 21:28.297
Can I talk to you
guys about something?

21:28.321 --> 21:30.399
Well, sweetheart, I'm
sorry, we gotta get going.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.667
We're gonna meet the mayor.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.002
Just hold on for one
second, please.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.238
Okay.

21:36.262 --> 21:38.674
What if someone I knew
was getting blackmailed?

21:38.698 --> 21:40.576
Blackmailed how?

21:40.600 --> 21:42.378
Well, there's this
kid at my school,

21:42.402 --> 21:45.348
and he's not gonna
be able to graduate

21:45.372 --> 21:47.716
if he doesn't do something
for someone else.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.485
Something sexual?

21:49.509 --> 21:53.255
What? No! Of course not.

21:53.279 --> 21:55.223
- Oh, I hope not.
- All right, honey.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.893
You know what I would do is
I would tell him to do it.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.562
Okay? It's a long
road otherwise.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.530
Trust me. I've been down it.

22:01.554 --> 22:04.232
Who's this kid? Do
I know his mother?

22:04.256 --> 22:06.669
No, you don't know him.

22:06.693 --> 22:09.405
Okay, well, then stop
stressing me out.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.106
I gotta get dressed.

22:11.130 --> 22:13.342
You have to get dressed too.

22:13.366 --> 22:14.910
I need a Xanax.

22:14.934 --> 22:18.104
Yeah, you and me both.

22:22.241 --> 22:24.052
Okay. Do you guys
wanna hear this?

22:24.076 --> 22:26.254
You totally wanna hear this.
You can't wait to hear this.

22:26.278 --> 22:27.923
So I was talking to Felicia,

22:27.947 --> 22:29.925
who's close with Shauna, who
overheard some girl say

22:29.949 --> 22:31.727
that the reason that
April broke up with you

22:31.751 --> 22:33.429
is because you made out
with another girl.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.030
Wow. Right?

22:35.054 --> 22:37.433
Trent, The only thing
I heard about you

22:37.457 --> 22:40.068
was that you made out with two
freshman girls on Friday night.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.037
It was three.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.439
Exactly. But no worries.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.940
I talked to Tawnie
down at the blog,

22:44.964 --> 22:46.875
and she said she'll
see what she can do.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.444
Oh, and there was
one more thing.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.713
Only 14 people mentioned my
hair on the A-List today.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.080
[beep]

22:52.104 --> 22:55.984
Well, 15. But still, rude.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.921
Hannah, you do have
beautiful hair, however...

22:58.945 --> 23:01.590
I sense that you have some
deep-rooted insecurities,

23:01.614 --> 23:04.092
therefore you like to
emphasize superficial things

23:04.116 --> 23:05.628
in fear that people might notice

23:05.652 --> 23:08.130
you aren't as perfect
as you look.

23:08.154 --> 23:12.134
Oh, you think I have
beautiful hair?

23:12.158 --> 23:14.169
Hannah, what if I was to do
something out of the ordinary,

23:14.193 --> 23:18.006
like join the Math Club or the
school musical or something?

23:18.030 --> 23:19.942
So you wanna do the musical?
Why?

23:19.966 --> 23:23.111
Well, maybe not the musical,
but something like that.

23:23.135 --> 23:24.680
You know, we have two
more months of school.

23:24.704 --> 23:27.950
What if I was to try
some new stuff?

23:27.974 --> 23:29.985
How would that look?

23:30.009 --> 23:31.820
It would definitely affect
your number on the list.

23:31.844 --> 23:33.355
Speaking of which, we have
to make an announcement.

23:33.379 --> 23:35.157
Announcement?

23:35.181 --> 23:37.426
Everyone's tweeting about
college, blogging about college,

23:37.450 --> 23:39.127
they're blogging about
tweeting about college.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.096
I'm weighing my options.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.633
You don't have time for that.
Everybody is dying to know.

23:44.657 --> 23:47.503
It's like it goes in the
top, to the left...

23:47.527 --> 23:49.438
Hey, Eric, what school
are you going to?

23:49.462 --> 23:50.706
On the left, dude, like...

23:50.730 --> 23:52.040
Eric, can I get a
quote for the blog?

23:52.064 --> 23:53.108
Yeah, for what?

23:53.132 --> 23:55.478
You're funny. College.

23:55.502 --> 23:57.546
I don't wanna keep
anyone in the dark.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.548
I just... I don't know
where I wanna go.

23:59.572 --> 24:03.118
Any comment on the fact that
your ex is attending Pressman?

24:03.142 --> 24:06.012
Told ya. Everyone's
dying to know.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.024
Who's that guy?

24:09.048 --> 24:10.526
Oh, that's Peter Craig.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.227
He has two first names?

24:12.251 --> 24:13.796
He's so sweet.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.131
It's true. It's
like he's not real.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.000
I can't find any dirt on him.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.802
Oh, he's also super smart.

24:19.826 --> 24:21.704
I heard he got a full
ride to Berkeley.

24:21.728 --> 24:23.038
Bet he goes to Poetry Club.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.139
Okay, are they dating?

24:24.163 --> 24:25.541
He's going to Berkeley.

24:25.565 --> 24:26.742
That's 3,000 miles
from New York.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.243
It would never work out.

24:28.267 --> 24:31.179
But there will be a Peter
Craig at Pressman.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.215
There's one at every school.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.083
I'm going to Pressman.

24:35.107 --> 24:36.384
What?

24:36.408 --> 24:38.420
Yeah.

24:38.444 --> 24:41.490
If there's gonna be a Peter
Craig at Pressman University,

24:41.514 --> 24:43.592
then his name's gonna
be Eric Schultz.

24:43.616 --> 24:46.352
Uh, what?

24:47.453 --> 24:49.932
Okay.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.567
Let's do your list.

24:51.591 --> 24:53.201
But in return,

24:53.225 --> 24:55.671
you better write me the
best damn recommendation

24:55.695 --> 24:58.006
to Pressman University
this world has ever seen.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.341
Okay.

24:59.365 --> 25:00.733
How do we do this?

25:03.636 --> 25:06.381
There are five pieces
of paper in here.

25:06.405 --> 25:09.051
- Five things to do.
- Okay.

25:09.075 --> 25:12.120
But I get to tag along
for everything.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.089
- What?
- Oh, come on!

25:14.113 --> 25:16.892
What fun would it be if I didn't
get to participate, right?

25:16.916 --> 25:18.393
We are gonna see so
much of each other.

25:18.417 --> 25:21.296
It is gonna be super awesome.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.557
That's not really
how I would put it.

25:30.396 --> 25:32.608
[scoffs] Okay, well, Trent
was our quarterback, so...

25:32.632 --> 25:34.076
Yes!

25:34.100 --> 25:37.746
- I have to date Trent?
- Mm-hmm.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.247
Well, can't I just
date a girl jock?

25:39.271 --> 25:41.584
Oh, you are so silly.
I am not a lesbian.

25:41.608 --> 25:44.620
But you're not the one
going on the date, so...

25:44.644 --> 25:48.323
Oh, you kids are at that
experimental age, right?

25:48.347 --> 25:50.225
All right, whatever. It's Trent.
We'll just hang out.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.960
- No. It's a date.
- Whatever.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.853
- It's a date.
- Fine. It's a date.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.566
With Trent.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.134
Yeah, I'm not wearing
a tie to school

25:59.158 --> 26:01.436
because this isn't
prep school, okay?

26:01.460 --> 26:04.172
Like, why am I in trouble?
I shouldn't be in trouble.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.174
- I was just in the bathroom.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:06.198 --> 26:09.311
You're not in trouble.
We're just bros.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.647
We're guys hanging out. We're
doing guy stuff right now.

26:11.671 --> 26:12.681
You're not in trouble.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.082
But you're the principal.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.084
That's me. Principal Bro.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.986
Yeah, and so as the principal,

26:18.010 --> 26:19.855
I'm saying you're
not in trouble.

26:19.879 --> 26:22.691
What I really wanna know is how
that party was over at Joe's.

26:22.715 --> 26:23.792
I heard it was crazy.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.427
- It was cool.
- Yeah.

26:25.451 --> 26:27.462
- Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
- I'll bet it was.

26:27.486 --> 26:29.297
Wait. Were you there?

26:29.321 --> 26:34.436
No. No, I had another
cool thing I was doing.

26:34.460 --> 26:35.938
But listen, if you guys
ever need anything,

26:35.962 --> 26:39.608
and I mean anything,
beer, whatever,

26:39.632 --> 26:41.844
you let me know, I'm your guy.

26:41.868 --> 26:43.478
- Beer?
- That's right.

26:43.502 --> 26:45.347
- Anything.
- Um...

26:45.371 --> 26:47.073
I mean, what?

26:49.976 --> 26:53.188
Hey, um, I need your advice.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.456
Yeah?

26:54.480 --> 26:56.491
It's for a friend. He...

26:56.515 --> 26:59.461
needs to ask a guy
out on a date.

26:59.485 --> 27:01.664
Is he gay?

27:01.688 --> 27:03.999
I know of an insane
coming-out group.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.801
No, he's not gay.

27:05.825 --> 27:08.470
It would be really open-minded
of me if I had a gay friend.

27:08.494 --> 27:13.508
Okay, well, I'm sorry to burst
your fantasy, but he's straight.

27:13.532 --> 27:17.512
You're saying that he's asking
a guy out, but he's not gay?

27:17.536 --> 27:19.581
Yes.

27:19.605 --> 27:22.208
And you say Poetry
Club is weird.

27:24.711 --> 27:27.055
The Poetry Club is weird.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.556
I didn't say that.
Did I say that?

27:28.580 --> 27:30.325
Hey, you should get
to class, all right?

27:30.349 --> 27:31.860
Keep it low. Keep it high.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.528
Don't get high...
unless it's with me.

27:33.552 --> 27:36.055
Just kidding. Not really. Okay.

27:37.757 --> 27:41.937
Principal Cameron
is a strange dude.

27:41.961 --> 27:45.173
Yeah. Definitely.

27:45.197 --> 27:50.045
Hey, Trent, we haven't really
hung out, just us, in a while.

27:50.069 --> 27:53.248
Well, yeah. You and April
are always together.

27:53.272 --> 27:58.721
Well, uh, no, we broke
up three months ago.

27:58.745 --> 28:02.057
No way, man.

28:02.081 --> 28:05.593
Trent, we have talked
about this ten times.

28:05.617 --> 28:08.463
[laughs] That's funny.

28:08.487 --> 28:10.699
Yeah, um...

28:10.723 --> 28:14.970
Anyway, I was just
gonna ask if, uh...

28:14.994 --> 28:16.739
Do you wanna go on a date?

28:16.763 --> 28:19.074
Yeah! For sure!

28:19.098 --> 28:20.608
Wait, what?

28:20.632 --> 28:23.111
A... A date.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.647
No, but I'm not gay.

28:25.671 --> 28:27.606
Neither am I.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.486
You're joking, right?

28:31.510 --> 28:33.789
Look, I'm not joking, but
it's not a big deal.

28:33.813 --> 28:37.259
Dude, we're bros.

28:37.283 --> 28:40.395
We can't be... homos.

28:40.419 --> 28:41.764
That's like illegal.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.489
Trent...

28:45.657 --> 28:47.426
just trust me.

28:59.538 --> 29:01.283
[door opens, closes]

29:01.307 --> 29:04.853
My presentation is on the
Texas governor race of 1933

29:04.877 --> 29:06.822
between Abraham Nixon
and George Kennedy.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.423
Kennedy was the...

29:08.447 --> 29:10.258
That's not even
an election year.

29:10.282 --> 29:13.028
Those are not even real people.

29:13.052 --> 29:15.363
Everybody loved Kennedy,

29:15.387 --> 29:17.265
but then he started
acting kind of strange.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.967
He stopped bathing regularly,

29:18.991 --> 29:22.270
and he started wearing clothing
that was super confusing.

29:22.294 --> 29:23.806
Voters went along with
it for a little while,

29:23.830 --> 29:26.942
but Nixon, well, he was
a sneaky little bitch.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.011
Trent.

29:29.035 --> 29:31.980
Hey. I need...

29:32.004 --> 29:34.682
I don't think he wants
to talk to you.

29:34.706 --> 29:37.452
Okay, just give him this.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.578
Done and done.

29:46.485 --> 29:50.465
So I don't actually have
a presentation prepared,

29:50.489 --> 29:53.068
but this morning
I woke up and...

29:53.092 --> 29:55.904
I mean, look at my hair.
It's awesome, right?

29:55.928 --> 29:58.406
- I spent like...
- So it's not confirmed yet,

29:58.430 --> 30:01.743
but there's an almost-rumor
that you asked Trent out.

30:01.767 --> 30:02.978
You asked Trent out?

30:03.002 --> 30:06.581
What? No.

30:06.605 --> 30:08.650
Hannah, can you kill this?

30:08.674 --> 30:10.986
Maybe for a little while,
but this almost-rumor

30:11.010 --> 30:13.088
will become a quiet
rumor by tonight

30:13.112 --> 30:14.656
and will become an
official full-blown rumor

30:14.680 --> 30:16.925
by tomorrow morning for sure.

30:16.949 --> 30:19.194
Wait. Are you just doing
this to get attention?

30:19.218 --> 30:21.696
Of course not.

30:21.720 --> 30:24.166
Hannah, just talk to me, okay?
What are my options here?

30:24.190 --> 30:27.535
You have no options. You
can't ask Trent out.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.604
I'm not gonna ask
Trent out on a date!

30:29.628 --> 30:31.773
Okay.

30:31.797 --> 30:34.200
Eric asked Trent out on a date?

30:41.908 --> 30:44.119
[message tones chiming]

30:44.143 --> 30:46.855
I didn't... Who's Trent?

30:46.879 --> 30:48.280
[chiming continues]

31:00.659 --> 31:03.238
Why is everybody
acting so weird?

31:03.262 --> 31:05.473
They think it's really cool
that you're so open-minded.

31:05.497 --> 31:06.942
They think it's cool

31:06.966 --> 31:08.643
that I wanted to go
on a date with Trent?

31:08.667 --> 31:11.279
It is cool. You're showing
it doesn't matter.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.215
You know who else would
think it's cool?

31:13.239 --> 31:14.716
Poetry Club.

31:14.740 --> 31:16.484
Please, Coach, extra credit?

31:16.508 --> 31:18.320
I don't even know what to do.

31:18.344 --> 31:19.654
I don't either, okay?

31:19.678 --> 31:21.123
But you better come
up with something

31:21.147 --> 31:22.790
because I said extra credit,

31:22.814 --> 31:24.250
and you're gonna do it.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.428
I'll see you later.

31:26.452 --> 31:29.831
Hey, uh, Mr. Bruner?

31:29.855 --> 31:32.968
What do you want?
You don't matter.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.802
You didn't even play football.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.438
Okay, fair enough.

31:36.462 --> 31:39.274
But for his extra credit,

31:39.298 --> 31:41.700
what if he went on
a date with a guy?

31:43.669 --> 31:46.481
I'm gonna pretend this
conversation didn't happen.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.084
No, I'm serious.
I'll even volunteer.

31:49.108 --> 31:51.419
I think that's
such a great idea.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.379
What is a great idea?

31:54.780 --> 31:56.791
The extra credit.

31:56.815 --> 31:59.027
The what?

31:59.051 --> 32:00.452
This is sociology, right?

32:03.155 --> 32:07.793
Two straight high school
boys going on a date.

32:12.331 --> 32:17.812
[laughs]

32:17.836 --> 32:21.140
Coach, please don't make me
go on a date with a guy!

32:26.478 --> 32:28.556
No one knows we're here, right?

32:28.580 --> 32:31.559
Don't worry. No one
knows we're here.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.561
Let's just get this
over with, okay?

32:33.585 --> 32:35.421
Oh, I hear ya, man.

32:37.189 --> 32:40.468
"Eric, you look
really cute tonight."

32:40.492 --> 32:44.639
"You look amazing too.

32:44.663 --> 32:49.044
You're one of the best-looking
guys I've ever seen.

32:49.068 --> 32:52.047
I really like it when you
do your hair like that."

32:52.071 --> 32:54.482
Um... [clears throat]

32:54.506 --> 32:57.109
"So what was it you
wanted to tell me?"

32:59.678 --> 33:01.723
"We've known each
other for a while,

33:01.747 --> 33:05.217
but I've never had the chance
to tell you how I feel."

33:07.519 --> 33:10.922
"H-How do you feel?"

33:12.358 --> 33:14.402
I need to take a shit.

33:14.426 --> 33:17.129
No.

33:19.931 --> 33:23.878
Okay, buck up, mister! You
need more passion here.

33:23.902 --> 33:27.582
I'm trying. It's just
so freaking weird.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.617
No, it's not. I
need more passion.

33:29.641 --> 33:31.619
You have to do this. Come on.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.921
Okay, um...

33:33.945 --> 33:38.693
I am the man of your dreams.
Right?

33:38.717 --> 33:41.096
Come on, passion.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.697
Just pump it up! Feel it.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.132
- Okay.
- Feel it!

33:44.156 --> 33:46.068
Okay. I will feel it.

33:46.092 --> 33:48.660
Okay. Cool. Good talk.

33:56.268 --> 33:58.480
I was worried for a second.
I'm a little nervous.

33:58.504 --> 34:01.983
Are you a little nervous?
Because I'm sweating.

34:02.007 --> 34:05.220
Oh, God. It's like
so hot in here.

34:05.244 --> 34:08.956
Can you please just calm down?

34:08.980 --> 34:11.726
Thank you. I've got this.

34:11.750 --> 34:12.851
Okay.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.320
Okay.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.306
Can we lose the scripts, man?

34:25.331 --> 34:27.007
- No.
- Yeah.

34:27.032 --> 34:29.577
Let's just have a conversation.

34:29.601 --> 34:33.038
We can, um, we can tell
each other how we feel.

34:34.639 --> 34:37.119
All right.

34:37.143 --> 34:39.521
So how do you feel?

34:39.545 --> 34:45.150
Uh, I think you're
a really cool guy.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.697
You have really nice eyes.

34:49.721 --> 34:53.268
Yeah, dude, there we go.
We're killing it right now.

34:53.292 --> 34:56.103
No, I'm serious.

34:56.128 --> 34:58.106
They're really kind of pretty.

34:58.130 --> 35:01.443
Um...

35:01.467 --> 35:03.302
Okay.

35:05.237 --> 35:09.016
Have you ever thought about...

35:09.040 --> 35:10.376
dating a guy?

35:12.844 --> 35:13.988
No.

35:14.012 --> 35:16.824
I never had either.

35:16.848 --> 35:19.527
I mean, we're dudes.

35:19.551 --> 35:22.997
Dudes date chicks, right?

35:23.021 --> 35:27.502
- Right.
- But then you got me thinking.

35:27.526 --> 35:30.505
And, well...

35:30.529 --> 35:31.697
why not?

35:33.165 --> 35:36.178
Um...

35:36.202 --> 35:39.214
Trent...

35:39.238 --> 35:42.374
I'm not actually
trying to date you.

35:45.010 --> 35:47.045
It's fine.

35:51.717 --> 35:55.830
This may be the first
date I've ever been on

35:55.854 --> 35:59.267
where I'm able to be myself.

35:59.291 --> 36:03.562
And for a guy like me,
that's a big step.

36:05.597 --> 36:09.076
I just wanna say thank you.

36:09.100 --> 36:15.617
I'm really, really
glad you asked me out.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.709
Sure. You're welcome, dude.

36:22.147 --> 36:23.782
Thank you.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.564
Was that the guidance counselor?

36:29.588 --> 36:31.399
Eric, is this a real
homosexual encounter,

36:31.423 --> 36:33.368
or are you just proving a point
that everybody's created equal?

36:33.392 --> 36:35.136
Uh, yeah.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.472
Trent's our star soccer player.

36:37.496 --> 36:41.909
And if he doesn't play,
then we don't win, right?

36:41.933 --> 36:44.579
This date was just an extra
credit assignment for sociology,

36:44.603 --> 36:46.648
so that he could play in
the game this weekend.

36:46.672 --> 36:49.384
- Oh, okay.
- All right.

36:49.408 --> 36:52.411
- Yeah, yeah.
- Simple, okay.

37:15.166 --> 37:16.478
Sylvia, what are you doing here?

37:16.502 --> 37:18.813
Eric!

37:18.837 --> 37:20.915
We have some planning to do.

37:20.939 --> 37:23.685
The date was a major
success party.

37:23.709 --> 37:28.290
Um, okay, well, can we
talk about this at school?

37:28.314 --> 37:29.624
Are your parents home?

37:29.648 --> 37:31.826
What are they like?

37:31.850 --> 37:35.129
Why do you wanna know
about my parents?

37:35.153 --> 37:36.798
I bet they're on a
date right now.

37:36.822 --> 37:39.000
I bet it's a really, really
beautiful restaurant

37:39.024 --> 37:42.937
with candles and...

37:42.961 --> 37:45.196
steak.

37:50.869 --> 37:53.548
Anyhoo, who's ready
for some more fun?

37:53.572 --> 37:55.216
Yay!

37:55.240 --> 37:57.218
Look, don't I get some time off,

37:57.242 --> 38:00.322
like a paid vacation
or something?

38:00.346 --> 38:02.990
You're sitting on the couch
playing guitar alone.

38:03.014 --> 38:05.560
That does not sound like a
very fun vacation to me.

38:05.584 --> 38:07.862
Right.

38:07.886 --> 38:10.231
Besides, I thought you
wanted to get this over with

38:10.255 --> 38:12.534
as quickly as possible.

38:12.558 --> 38:14.569
No. Yeah, I do.

38:14.593 --> 38:15.637
All right, here, let me see.

38:15.661 --> 38:16.928
Okay.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.333
What'd ya get?

38:24.336 --> 38:26.414
Hey, stranger! No whip.

38:26.438 --> 38:29.984
Thanks. Since when are
you up this early?

38:30.008 --> 38:32.820
Since I decided to try
out for cheerleading.

38:32.844 --> 38:35.423
- No, you're not.
- Yeah, I am.

38:35.447 --> 38:37.224
I won't let you on the team.

38:37.248 --> 38:39.060
That's not very April of you.

38:39.084 --> 38:41.496
Anyone who wants to try
out should be able to.

38:41.520 --> 38:45.900
Eric Schultz does not cheer.
Why are you doing this?

38:45.924 --> 38:48.570
I don't know. I mean, why not?

38:48.594 --> 38:50.572
We only have two months
of school left anyway.

38:50.596 --> 38:52.273
So it's a joke?

38:52.297 --> 38:54.542
You know, the girls on the
team have put years into this.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.277
Look, maybe if I do this,

38:56.301 --> 38:58.346
it'll show other guys
that cheerleading's cool.

38:58.370 --> 38:59.781
[phone chimes]

38:59.805 --> 39:03.117
Maybe they'll remember
this next year.

39:03.141 --> 39:05.019
So you're not just doing
this for attention?

39:05.043 --> 39:07.789
No. Look, I really...

39:07.813 --> 39:09.615
I wanna make a point.

39:10.982 --> 39:13.795
Fine. Tryouts are
this afternoon.

39:13.819 --> 39:16.263
HANNAH: But you'll be the
only guy at our school.

39:16.287 --> 39:18.966
Who cares if I'm the
only guy on the team?

39:18.990 --> 39:20.468
Guys don't cheer.

39:20.492 --> 39:22.470
It's always been that
way at our school.

39:22.494 --> 39:24.038
It's pretty old school, Hannah.

39:24.062 --> 39:27.041
Is, uh... Is it cool
to be a cheerleader?

39:27.065 --> 39:28.610
I mean, I've always
wanted to be one,

39:28.634 --> 39:30.545
but I didn't know it was cool.

39:30.569 --> 39:33.114
Yeah. I mean, I'm doing it.

39:33.138 --> 39:36.651
Don't let Eric misinform you.
It's not okay, ever.

39:36.675 --> 39:38.486
Are you thinking
about trying out?

39:38.510 --> 39:39.921
Why would I wanna
be a cheerleader?

39:39.945 --> 39:42.123
That kind of label
sticks with you forever.

39:42.147 --> 39:43.825
I was talking to him.

39:43.849 --> 39:46.227
Yeah. I'm going to try out.

39:46.251 --> 39:47.629
That's awesome, dude.

39:47.653 --> 39:48.896
Well, you're gonna
be hanging out

39:48.920 --> 39:50.264
with the hottest
girls in school.

39:50.288 --> 39:53.468
Oh, and the skirts.

39:53.492 --> 39:54.860
Short skirts.

40:04.636 --> 40:06.581
Hey, Eric, we need to start.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.607
All right, okay, coming!

40:12.377 --> 40:14.622
Fits pretty well, right?

40:14.646 --> 40:18.025
If you make the team, we'll
give you guys uniforms.

40:18.049 --> 40:20.452
You know what? I kinda like it.

40:32.698 --> 40:36.110
Hey, guys, why don't you
watch from over there first?

40:36.134 --> 40:38.345
Oh. You don't think
I can hack it?

40:38.369 --> 40:40.815
I guarantee that you
can't do this cheer.

40:40.839 --> 40:42.908
Okay.

40:50.381 --> 40:53.294
Okay, so you've been
sidelined already?

40:53.318 --> 40:56.688
Gimme a break. I just started.

40:59.324 --> 41:01.368
You know, when I was young,

41:01.392 --> 41:03.838
I used to go to all the
cheering practices,

41:03.862 --> 41:05.907
and I would watch
all the routines,

41:05.931 --> 41:10.144
and then I would go home,
and I would just...

41:10.168 --> 41:12.680
I would do them all.

41:12.704 --> 41:17.719
So do you know how
to do this stuff?

41:17.743 --> 41:19.587
Yeah.

41:19.611 --> 41:23.725
I mean, it's been years.

41:23.749 --> 41:27.428
Okay, Eric, can you
please play attention

41:27.452 --> 41:28.863
because technique is
really important,

41:28.887 --> 41:30.364
otherwise somebody can get hurt.

41:30.388 --> 41:31.666
Sorry.

41:31.690 --> 41:34.092
This routine is
pretty simple though.

41:59.284 --> 42:00.752
Yay.

42:07.593 --> 42:08.594
Lakers!

42:12.964 --> 42:15.142
Ow. Doesn't that hurt you?

42:15.166 --> 42:17.912
After a while, your downstairs
really starts to callus over.

42:17.936 --> 42:20.338
Oh, that is so hot.

42:23.108 --> 42:27.922
Uh, I feel like cheerleading
is like 98% observation,

42:27.946 --> 42:31.793
so I'm just gonna... I'm
gonna sit out one more time

42:31.817 --> 42:33.728
- until I'm sure I've got it.
- Eric.

42:33.752 --> 42:37.098
Gregory doesn't seem like he
has a problem with the cheer.

42:37.122 --> 42:39.591
Yeah. He doesn't.

42:43.194 --> 42:44.963
This is awesome!

42:47.265 --> 42:48.266
Ah...

42:52.537 --> 42:55.473
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God. Um...

42:58.009 --> 43:00.478
I'm okay? I'm okay.

43:03.682 --> 43:04.792
Eric.

43:04.816 --> 43:07.361
Hey. Hey, man.

43:07.385 --> 43:08.963
Dude, thank you.

43:08.987 --> 43:11.332
That was awesome.

43:11.356 --> 43:13.859
Yeah.

43:18.797 --> 43:20.298
Gosh.

43:22.701 --> 43:26.237
Are we like in trouble
or something?

43:28.206 --> 43:29.717
No.

43:29.741 --> 43:31.653
No, no, of course not.

43:31.677 --> 43:35.723
I mean, I just, I mean, I
just came over to watch.

43:35.747 --> 43:38.626
- You have an amazing routine.
- Obvi.

43:38.650 --> 43:41.195
She's just, you know,
here to help us out.

43:41.219 --> 43:43.731
How is the guidance
counselor a help?

43:43.755 --> 43:47.068
Well, first of all,
she has a name, okay?

43:47.092 --> 43:49.070
It's Sylvia.

43:49.094 --> 43:55.342
And actually, she was captain
of the cheer team, right?

43:55.366 --> 43:57.378
She got second place
at Nationals.

43:57.402 --> 43:59.180
You did?

43:59.204 --> 44:01.849
- Yes.
- That's so cool.

44:01.873 --> 44:04.085
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

44:04.109 --> 44:07.154
- Oh, she's so modest.
- I...

44:07.178 --> 44:09.323
I would love to see your
routine from Nationals.

44:09.347 --> 44:10.758
I bet it was amazing.

44:10.782 --> 44:11.993
Hey, that's a great idea!

44:12.017 --> 44:13.427
Why don't you show us a cheer?

44:13.451 --> 44:15.362
Oh, 'cause that's really silly!

44:15.386 --> 44:18.599
I haven't done it in years.
[laughs]

44:18.623 --> 44:21.235
Oh, but, would you please
just show us something?

44:21.259 --> 44:23.762
- That would be awesome.
- Yeah!

44:25.263 --> 44:26.440
Hey.

44:26.464 --> 44:28.700
You got this.

44:30.368 --> 44:31.402
Okay.

44:33.204 --> 44:36.474
Okay, um, I'm just gonna
take off my glasses.

44:39.077 --> 44:40.287
- Girls?
- Whew!

44:40.311 --> 44:41.622
Whoops!

44:41.646 --> 44:43.081
Okay.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.169
[clears throat]

45:05.270 --> 45:07.548
All right.

45:07.572 --> 45:10.584
Ready?

45:10.608 --> 45:11.843
Okay.

45:15.180 --> 45:18.960
Let's go, Lakers.

45:18.984 --> 45:24.065
Let's go, Lakers.

45:24.089 --> 45:26.834
Let's go, Lakers!

45:26.858 --> 45:28.970
Let's go, Lakers!

45:28.994 --> 45:31.662
Let's go, Lakers! Let's go!

45:48.446 --> 45:51.125
[cheering]

45:51.149 --> 45:54.528
[screaming]

45:54.552 --> 45:57.832
[excited chatter]

45:57.856 --> 46:00.667
I know, right? I was... Okay!

46:00.691 --> 46:02.536
Let's go, Lakers!

46:02.560 --> 46:06.131
[chatter continues]

46:09.968 --> 46:12.537
You don't quit, do you?

46:15.473 --> 46:17.551
- Sylvia, wait up!
- Oh, hey, girls.

46:17.575 --> 46:19.053
- What's up?
- Oh, you know, I don't know.

46:19.077 --> 46:20.621
I have to get back
to work though.

46:20.645 --> 46:21.889
I didn't know you and
Eric were friends.

46:21.913 --> 46:24.058
He's like a little
brother to me.

46:24.082 --> 46:25.993
Is he just as nice in real life?

46:26.017 --> 46:27.494
What are you doing
later tonight?

46:27.518 --> 46:30.297
I don't know. I have to
get back to the office.

46:30.321 --> 46:32.366
We should hang out. Jimmy's
throwing a sick party tonight.

46:32.390 --> 46:34.869
- Yeah, you should so go.
- Oh, wow. Okay, yeah, sick.

46:34.893 --> 46:37.428
Okay, I don't know. Maybe. Bye.

46:39.064 --> 46:40.665
Oh, my God.

46:45.103 --> 46:46.713
Fuck yeah!

46:46.737 --> 46:49.074
[doorbell ringing]

46:51.209 --> 46:52.319
- Hey.
- Hi.

46:52.343 --> 46:53.845
- Here, come on in.
- Okay.

46:58.249 --> 47:01.195
Okay, are you ready
to go to the party?

47:01.219 --> 47:03.497
I don't know. I don't know.

47:03.521 --> 47:05.266
I don't know if... I
don't feel like...

47:05.290 --> 47:06.767
I don't belong.

47:06.791 --> 47:09.871
Hey, listen, the entire
cheerleading squad

47:09.895 --> 47:11.438
is talking about how
excited they are

47:11.462 --> 47:12.840
that you are going
to this party.

47:12.864 --> 47:14.508
- Really?
- Yeah.

47:14.532 --> 47:18.079
No. I'm a guidance counselor, Eric.
I can't.

47:18.103 --> 47:19.546
This is so stupid and...

47:19.570 --> 47:21.615
Okay, so, hey, use
it as an opportunity

47:21.639 --> 47:24.886
to warn us about the dangers
of underage drinking.

47:24.910 --> 47:26.753
Eric, I don't know.

47:26.777 --> 47:29.190
Eric, were you the last
one to use my car?

47:29.214 --> 47:31.216
It's filthy.

47:33.284 --> 47:34.595
I'm sorry.

47:34.619 --> 47:36.730
Who's this?

47:36.754 --> 47:40.067
This is my guidance counselor.

47:40.091 --> 47:43.204
We were just talking
about college stuff.

47:43.228 --> 47:46.874
Shouldn't she be talking
about that in school?

47:46.898 --> 47:49.576
This seems really inappropriate.

47:49.600 --> 47:52.837
Um, no, it's not a big deal.

47:55.440 --> 47:59.586
I'm sorry. You look...

47:59.610 --> 48:02.990
What did you say your name was?

48:03.014 --> 48:04.425
Sylvia.

48:04.449 --> 48:06.793
- Sylvia?
- Yeah.

48:06.817 --> 48:08.795
I think you should go.

48:08.819 --> 48:12.924
Any school-related subjects can
be handled in your office.

48:14.492 --> 48:17.071
I'm sorry.

48:17.095 --> 48:20.674
Yes, you're abs... You're...
I'm... I'm gonna go.

48:20.698 --> 48:24.645
And, Eric, next time you
wanna invite someone over,

48:24.669 --> 48:27.114
I think you should clear
it with me first.

48:27.138 --> 48:29.183
I didn't think you would care.

48:29.207 --> 48:31.009
I care.

48:32.377 --> 48:34.355
I'm sorry, I'm just gonna...

48:34.379 --> 48:37.324
I just wanna tell you that
this is not Eric's fault.

48:37.348 --> 48:40.127
I told him that I could
come over, and it's not...

48:40.151 --> 48:42.964
Oh, you know what?

48:42.988 --> 48:46.133
I wasn't even talking
to you, so...

48:46.157 --> 48:48.435
- Why are you being rude to her?
- You know what?

48:48.459 --> 48:51.872
I don't even have time for this
discussion right now. I'm late.

48:51.896 --> 48:53.398
We'll discuss this later.

48:56.367 --> 48:57.568
[door closes]

49:03.741 --> 49:06.487
I don't really feel like
going to a party anymore.

49:06.511 --> 49:10.381
I don't really feel
like going either.

49:12.083 --> 49:17.064
Thank you for trying or...

49:17.088 --> 49:18.756
something.

49:22.427 --> 49:25.997
Hey, you wanna see a picture
of my mom with braces?

49:39.410 --> 49:42.513
What the eff?

49:46.517 --> 49:49.997
Oh, hey, Lacey, did you
talk to April last night?

49:50.021 --> 49:51.732
Yeah.

49:51.756 --> 49:53.267
How'd it go? Does she, um...

49:53.291 --> 49:54.835
she wanna get back together?

49:54.859 --> 49:56.937
I don't know.

49:56.961 --> 50:00.074
You don't know if...

50:00.098 --> 50:03.244
Well, okay. The whole cheering thing?
I mean, really?

50:03.268 --> 50:06.347
She might've bought it,
but I certainly didn't.

50:06.371 --> 50:09.550
I didn't even make the squad.

50:09.574 --> 50:11.118
Yeah, but then why did
you even try out?

50:11.142 --> 50:13.754
And why did you go on
a date with Trent?

50:13.778 --> 50:15.756
Look, I only did that
so he could play.

50:15.780 --> 50:17.791
April is my friend.

50:17.815 --> 50:20.094
I just... I can't
in good conscience

50:20.118 --> 50:22.387
try getting you back together
if you're playing games.

50:24.122 --> 50:26.133
Okay. Can I tell you something?

50:26.157 --> 50:29.236
Eric, you know you can trust me.

50:29.260 --> 50:32.039
I have to do this list.

50:32.063 --> 50:33.631
What do you mean, list?

50:46.644 --> 50:48.989
Oh, hey, April's
up to number two.

50:49.013 --> 50:51.458
Whatever. The only
list that matters

50:51.482 --> 50:53.394
is the last week of school.

50:53.418 --> 50:54.728
Whoever's number
one on that list

50:54.752 --> 50:56.463
will be our inevitable V.I.P.

50:56.487 --> 50:58.399
That's a good point.

50:58.423 --> 51:01.168
A lot can change
between now and then.

51:01.192 --> 51:03.737
I could do a
headline about Eric.

51:03.761 --> 51:05.496
Oh, or what about Sylvia?

51:07.198 --> 51:08.775
Save that.

51:08.799 --> 51:11.536
I have a feeling a much
bigger story is brewing.

51:13.538 --> 51:17.418
It's interesting how close Eric
and Lacey seem to be, isn't it?

51:17.442 --> 51:19.686
Where's Jimmy?

51:19.710 --> 51:21.455
I think he's sick today.

51:21.479 --> 51:23.290
Have they been spending
a lot of time together?

51:23.314 --> 51:26.593
- No idea.
- Well, do you think...

51:26.617 --> 51:31.665
I could never suggest that. I
mean, they're my best friends.

51:31.689 --> 51:35.369
Well, they may be your friends,
but that looks suspicious.

51:35.393 --> 51:38.272
I hate to admit it, but I
guess you just can't argue

51:38.296 --> 51:40.798
with the cold, hard facts.

51:51.676 --> 51:53.654
I had a feeling
something was up.

51:53.678 --> 51:55.213
Yeah. It sucks.

51:56.581 --> 51:58.692
Eric! Lacey.

51:58.716 --> 52:01.061
I have to talk to you.

52:01.085 --> 52:04.198
Okay. I should get to class,
but I'll see you later.

52:04.222 --> 52:05.823
Okay, bye.

52:07.592 --> 52:09.336
You here to bring
me my next task?

52:09.360 --> 52:11.205
I just read something
on the school blog.

52:11.229 --> 52:13.140
Okay. What was it?

52:13.164 --> 52:16.410
You and Lacey are sneaking
around behind Jimmy's back.

52:16.434 --> 52:17.644
- What?
- What?

52:17.668 --> 52:18.712
I know!

52:18.736 --> 52:20.104
Pig.

52:21.439 --> 52:23.317
Okay, you know what?

52:23.341 --> 52:25.486
You cannot let people think that
you're cheating with Lacey.

52:25.510 --> 52:27.354
This is not fair!

52:27.378 --> 52:30.924
Okay, well, I'm not gonna
stop hanging out with Lacey.

52:30.948 --> 52:36.062
Okay, well, then I came up
with a solution, possibly.

52:36.086 --> 52:38.165
Why don't you just
pick out of the hat,

52:38.189 --> 52:41.435
and maybe it will take people's
minds off it for a little bit.

52:41.459 --> 52:44.505
- Okay.
- Pick it up.

52:44.529 --> 52:46.440
Mm-hmm. Yup. Mm-hmm.

52:46.464 --> 52:47.841
- You know what?
- What?

52:47.865 --> 52:49.576
- This actually might help.
- I know.

52:49.600 --> 52:51.736
That's what I'm here for.

52:53.971 --> 52:56.082
You gotta give him
a chance, Coach.

52:56.106 --> 52:58.084
I have always wanted
to play soccer, sir.

52:58.108 --> 52:59.920
And I promise I will
not let you down.

52:59.944 --> 53:01.355
Oh, stop your whining.

53:01.379 --> 53:02.923
You sound like a little bitch.

53:02.947 --> 53:05.025
He's Eric. I mean,
he'll be a natural.

53:05.049 --> 53:07.294
He's good at everything.

53:07.318 --> 53:08.986
He's just incredible.

53:11.322 --> 53:14.601
He's good at everything, huh?
You're a natural?

53:14.625 --> 53:16.570
I... I'm, I don't know.

53:16.594 --> 53:19.473
Oh, fine. First string.

53:19.497 --> 53:21.275
First string?

53:21.299 --> 53:23.710
You said he's a natural. He's
good at everything, right?

53:23.734 --> 53:26.547
I more meant I could
like ease into it.

53:26.571 --> 53:29.440
It's too late. I
made my decision.

53:32.310 --> 53:35.722
Okay, Eric, you better not screw
this up for us, okay, bud?

53:35.746 --> 53:37.724
Of course. Hey,
hey, I can do this.

53:37.748 --> 53:38.949
Oh, and, boys...

53:42.520 --> 53:47.525
we lose a single game, and
I will kill you both.

53:58.936 --> 54:05.018
Hey, come on, dude!
What's your problem?

54:05.042 --> 54:06.853
Why are these guys
being such dicks?

54:06.877 --> 54:08.489
I know. It's weird.

54:08.513 --> 54:11.825
I mean, you're attractive
and super rich.

54:11.849 --> 54:13.927
The essentials to life.

54:13.951 --> 54:16.330
Eric, you're not
a soccer player.

54:16.354 --> 54:18.499
It would be different if you
were actually good at soccer,

54:18.523 --> 54:21.134
but if you fail
at a sport, well,

54:21.158 --> 54:23.060
you're going to be
a laughingstock.

54:24.962 --> 54:27.941
What's the big deal? I
mean, it's just a game.

54:27.965 --> 54:30.677
- It's not just a game.
- It's not just a game.

54:30.701 --> 54:33.213
Eric, can I get a
quote for the blog?

54:33.237 --> 54:36.850
Hey! You are making up
rumors about me and Lacey.

54:36.874 --> 54:39.620
I don't make up the news.
I just report it.

54:39.644 --> 54:41.688
What have I ever done to you?

54:41.712 --> 54:43.290
I'm just doing my job.

54:43.314 --> 54:45.350
No, give it to me! Don't!

54:47.352 --> 54:48.562
You're an asshole.

54:48.586 --> 54:51.465
Look, write whatever
you want, okay?

54:51.489 --> 54:53.724
No one's gonna
believe you anyways.

54:58.396 --> 55:00.541
Picking a fight with the media.

55:00.565 --> 55:02.199
Nice move.

55:03.834 --> 55:05.846
The decline of former
A-Lister Eric Schultz

55:05.870 --> 55:07.414
took another dive last night

55:07.438 --> 55:09.583
when it was confirmed
by multiple sources

55:09.607 --> 55:12.252
that he was, in fact, a loser

55:12.276 --> 55:14.488
and that he was cheating
on April Adamson

55:14.512 --> 55:16.923
with his best friend's
girlfriend, Lacey Parish,

55:16.947 --> 55:17.991
all of last year.

Oh, no, the world is over.

effing unpopular, Eric?

56:08.298 --> 56:10.911
Look, I'm not unpopular.
I'm number 12.

I can't handle it?

58:24.602 --> 58:26.847

- Whoa.

58:26.871 --> 58:29.616
Yeah. He didn't
even play football.

58:29.640 --> 58:32.185

01:04:32.636 --> 01:04:34.480
That's it?

01:04:34.504 --> 01:04:36.883
Yeah.

01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:39.953
It sucks having you mad
at me, and Lacey and I,

01:04:39.977 --> 01:04:41.387
we would never try to...

01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:43.823
I know you guys
didn't do anything.

01:04:43.847 --> 01:04:45.491
You do?

01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:48.852
Well, then why are you mad?

01:04:49.987 --> 01:04:51.564
I'm sorry.

01:04:51.588 --> 01:04:53.499
Could you tell Eric
he's being a hypocrite?

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:55.635
Eric, you're being a hypocrite.

01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:58.905
Yeah, I heard. Will
you tell Jimmy...

01:04:58.929 --> 01:05:00.240
that I'm sorry?

01:05:00.264 --> 01:05:01.841
I don't know what
else I can say.

01:05:01.865 --> 01:05:03.743
You don't even know what
you're sorry about.

01:05:03.767 --> 01:05:05.912
Well, then tell me.

01:05:05.936 --> 01:05:09.315
You always made me feel really
stupid for writing poetry,

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:12.518
and then here you go doing
all this other crazy shit.

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:14.154
You do whatever you want.

01:05:14.178 --> 01:05:15.922
Yeah, but look how it
turned out for me, man.

01:05:15.946 --> 01:05:18.658

At least you got to
live out your fantasy.

01:05:26.556 --> 01:05:29.202
Trust me, I am not
living out my fantasy.

01:05:29.226 --> 01:05:31.371

What's wrong?

01:05:48.212 --> 01:05:50.023
You know what's wrong.

01:05:50.047 --> 01:05:51.724
Oh.

01:05:51.748 --> 01:05:53.526

of your parents.

hold you here overnight.

01:11:31.254 --> 01:11:34.891

No, no. It's...

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:14.374
It's, uh...

It's not all your fault.

Well, you know what? I
didn't have to do this.

I didn't have to do any of it.

You're the only one
who bailed me out.

01:12:49.466 --> 01:12:51.300
Thanks.

01:12:54.237 --> 01:12:57.783
You know, I, uh...

01:12:57.807 --> 01:13:02.121
I used to have a
crush on your dad

01:13:02.145 --> 01:13:04.123
when I was in high school.

01:13:04.147 --> 01:13:05.558

01:13:05.582 --> 01:13:07.993
Yeah.

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:09.562
Why?

01:13:09.586 --> 01:13:12.164
I don't know.

01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:16.092
I was a kid, and, uh...

01:13:17.527 --> 01:13:21.774
he was the only popular
guy who was...

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:25.101
who was ever nice to me.

Well, he doesn't
even talk to me.

01:13:30.373 --> 01:13:35.612
I don't even know who he is.

01:13:39.215 --> 01:13:42.151
I'm sure he's a good guy.

01:13:50.193 --> 01:13:52.729
No, I just...

what it would be like...

01:14:02.472 --> 01:14:05.374

of that was her fault.

01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:33.196
that we dropped out of college
and became rock stars.

01:20:35.231 --> 01:20:38.177
That's not part of my poem. I
don't know why I said that.

01:20:38.201 --> 01:20:39.635
That's weird.

01:20:51.147 --> 01:20:52.925
Jimmy, I hate poetry.

01:20:52.949 --> 01:20:55.861
But you're my friend, you know?

01:20:55.885 --> 01:20:58.097
And...

01:20:58.121 --> 01:21:00.432
I really miss you.

01:21:00.456 --> 01:21:01.934
I'm sorry I made you feel stupid

01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:04.060
for doing something
that you love to do.

01:21:07.463 --> 01:21:09.074
I read your poem.

01:21:09.098 --> 01:21:10.409
Seriously?

01:21:10.433 --> 01:21:13.278
It's really good, man.

01:21:13.302 --> 01:21:16.715
I mean, you are way hotter
than Emily Dickinson.

01:21:16.739 --> 01:21:19.075
Metaphorically.

Hey, Trent. Trent.

01:22:32.848 --> 01:22:34.393
Hey, what's up?

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:37.829
Dude, I am so sorry.

01:22:37.853 --> 01:22:40.399
Uh... what?

01:22:40.423 --> 01:22:42.234
For your leg.

01:22:42.258 --> 01:22:43.969
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:22:43.993 --> 01:22:46.071
I'm not playing soccer
at Indiana next year.

01:22:46.095 --> 01:22:48.407
Oh, God, that's terrible.

01:22:48.431 --> 01:22:51.810
No! It's a good thing.
It's awesome!

01:22:51.834 --> 01:22:55.880
Now my dad's not on my back
about winning and my future.

01:22:55.904 --> 01:23:01.210
Now I'm free to just kind
of decide for myself.

01:23:03.346 --> 01:23:08.560
So I was thinking,
man, maybe, uh...

01:23:08.584 --> 01:23:12.764
we could go on a date.

01:23:12.788 --> 01:23:14.166
I'm not gay, Trent.

01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:16.859
Oh! Dude, bro, me neither.

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:21.864
Okay.

01:23:23.799 --> 01:23:26.078
Hey! There you are!

01:23:26.102 --> 01:23:28.347
Hannah! Hannah.

01:23:28.371 --> 01:23:31.016
Where are you going at
10:00 in the morning?

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.518
I'll call you back. I'm
going fake dress shopping.

01:23:33.542 --> 01:23:35.254
You know, someone will
probably see me buy it,

01:23:35.278 --> 01:23:37.289
and then go buy it later
to feel cool or something.

01:23:37.313 --> 01:23:39.558
So I tipped off The Times
about my shopping today.

01:23:39.582 --> 01:23:41.793
Okay.

01:23:41.817 --> 01:23:44.296
Uh, so I have a question.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.232
Well, it's more
like a huge favor.

01:23:47.256 --> 01:23:51.203
Eric, you know that I would
do anything for you.

01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:55.940
Um, can you work your magic
for me for V.I.P. voting?

01:23:55.964 --> 01:23:58.743
Oh, and why would I do that?

01:23:58.767 --> 01:24:00.579
Hannah, you know everyone.

01:24:00.603 --> 01:24:02.747
People come to you
for everything.

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:05.550
True. I could.

01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:07.586
But don't you still
hang out with Sylvia?

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:11.556
Wait until you hear the
dirt going out on her.

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:12.957
It's coming out later tonight.

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:14.459
What dirt?

01:24:14.483 --> 01:24:17.096
Well, she had all this
stuff in her office...

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.464
from when she was
still in high school.

01:24:19.488 --> 01:24:21.133
It was so pathetic.

01:24:21.157 --> 01:24:25.137
Why are you... Why are
you doing this to her?

01:24:25.161 --> 01:24:26.805
I'm not doing anything.

01:24:26.829 --> 01:24:29.241
I think the evidence
speaks for itself.

01:24:29.265 --> 01:24:31.600
Look, don't even think
about posting that.

01:24:33.869 --> 01:24:35.847
I do what I want, Eric.

01:24:35.871 --> 01:24:38.083
I've always been the one
to control this school.

01:24:38.107 --> 01:24:39.418
We'll see about that.

01:24:39.442 --> 01:24:41.086
Is that a threat?

01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:43.088
I would say that's
definitely a threat.

01:24:43.112 --> 01:24:48.184
Just to be clear, I'm
going to destroy you.

01:24:52.355 --> 01:24:56.435
Good morning, Lake Odell High.
This is Hannah Ford.

01:24:56.459 --> 01:24:58.270
It's the week before the
Student Choice Awards

01:24:58.294 --> 01:25:00.004
here at Lake Odell High,

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:03.375
and this may turn out to
be the strangest year yet.

01:25:03.399 --> 01:25:05.277
What a rollercoaster
ride it has been

01:25:05.301 --> 01:25:07.346
for student Eric Schultz.

01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:08.813
From his bizarre cheerleading

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:11.049
to his irresponsible
personal life,

01:25:11.073 --> 01:25:14.553
this has resulted in one
very unpopular student.

01:25:14.577 --> 01:25:17.156
Rumors are out that Eric
is throwing himself

01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:19.023
in the race for V.I.P.

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:21.226
When polled, 14% of students

01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:23.528
say they will vote
for Eric Schultz.

01:25:23.552 --> 01:25:27.031
This is down from 82% from the
beginning of the school year.

01:25:27.055 --> 01:25:29.301
When asked why they wouldn't
vote for Eric Schultz,

01:25:29.325 --> 01:25:32.204
89% say it's due to
suspicious behavior,

01:25:32.228 --> 01:25:34.906
while the other 11% simply said,

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:37.041
"He didn't even play football."

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:38.910
And with Eric out of the race,

01:25:38.934 --> 01:25:41.913
students are in dismay
with who to vote for.

01:25:41.937 --> 01:25:43.382
[giggling]

01:25:43.406 --> 01:25:45.741
This is Hannah Ford signing off.

01:25:50.246 --> 01:25:51.856
Oh, this is so awesome.

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.592
I'm breaking and entering
with Eric Schultz.

01:25:53.616 --> 01:25:54.617
Shh!

01:25:56.252 --> 01:25:58.053
[engine starts]

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:06.871
Okay, so... Dude...

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:08.240
What?

01:26:08.264 --> 01:26:09.765
But, Eric!

01:26:13.135 --> 01:26:16.581
Dude, where did you
even get these?

01:26:16.605 --> 01:26:18.274
They enhance my masculinity.

01:26:19.708 --> 01:26:22.387
Wait, how do you know the code?

01:26:22.411 --> 01:26:24.122
Hannah and I dated
in ninth grade.

01:26:24.146 --> 01:26:26.215
Oh, lucky bastard.

01:26:27.883 --> 01:26:30.052
[motor starts]

01:26:36.158 --> 01:26:38.303
All right, come on. Shh!

01:26:38.327 --> 01:26:41.139
Okay, so we need to get whatever
dirt that she has on Sylvia.

01:26:41.163 --> 01:26:42.474
Can you do that?

01:26:42.498 --> 01:26:45.477
Eric, I can do that in my sleep.

01:26:45.501 --> 01:26:47.270
Okay. Let's go.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.985
[exhales]

01:26:54.009 --> 01:26:56.087
Are you ready?

01:26:56.111 --> 01:26:58.257
Can I take one of her bras?

01:26:58.281 --> 01:26:59.415
Sure.

01:27:29.211 --> 01:27:31.456
Okay, come on,
dude, let's focus.

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.126
She doesn't have any
diseases, does she?

01:27:35.150 --> 01:27:36.218
Probably.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.356
[sniffs]

01:27:44.727 --> 01:27:47.939
Okay, so...

01:27:47.963 --> 01:27:49.974
we need to find Sylvia
Martin on here.

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:53.177
- Yeah, just give me a sec.
- Okay.

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:54.879
Wh-What?

01:27:54.903 --> 01:27:57.239
- Wait, what is that?
- Look.

01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:01.910
- Okay, print all of this out.
- Right.

01:28:04.847 --> 01:28:06.882
Hey, what are you gonna do?

01:28:17.092 --> 01:28:19.037
Hannah's number one
on the A-List.

01:28:19.061 --> 01:28:21.897
- Wow.
- How did that happen?

01:28:35.043 --> 01:28:36.421
I'm going to puke.

01:28:36.445 --> 01:28:38.089
I sniffed her panties.

01:28:38.113 --> 01:28:41.183
That's not really something
you should say out loud.

01:28:43.786 --> 01:28:46.765
Hey, loves. How are you?

01:28:46.789 --> 01:28:49.501
Really good. I'm excited
for the awards show.

01:28:49.525 --> 01:28:51.102
Are you?

01:28:51.126 --> 01:28:54.005
Yeah, I'm excited to see
who the winners are.

01:28:54.029 --> 01:28:57.442
Well, it is the most important
day of all of our lives.

01:28:57.466 --> 01:28:59.110
Yeah.

01:28:59.134 --> 01:29:00.369
Bye, loves.

01:29:02.405 --> 01:29:04.349
All right, so did you invite
everyone over to my house

01:29:04.373 --> 01:29:05.517
to go to the awards show?

01:29:05.541 --> 01:29:07.810
All but one.

01:29:20.756 --> 01:29:22.601
I am so sorry.

01:29:22.625 --> 01:29:24.803
Are you just devastated

01:29:24.827 --> 01:29:28.373
that Hannah's higher
than you on the A-List?

01:29:28.397 --> 01:29:30.642
So devastated.

01:29:30.666 --> 01:29:33.545
I know that you don't
wanna talk to me,

01:29:33.569 --> 01:29:35.213
but I'm inviting everyone
over to my place

01:29:35.237 --> 01:29:37.382
to go to the awards show, so...

01:29:37.406 --> 01:29:38.583
I wanted to see if
you could come.

01:29:38.607 --> 01:29:40.385
Who's everyone?

01:29:40.409 --> 01:29:43.555
Whoever wants to come. It's
our last party as a class

01:29:43.579 --> 01:29:45.590
so I feel like we
should all be together.

01:29:45.614 --> 01:29:47.559
What are you scheming, Mr.
Schultz?

01:29:47.583 --> 01:29:50.294
Absolutely nothing.

01:29:50.318 --> 01:29:52.588
Maybe I'll be there.

01:29:56.358 --> 01:29:59.137
Hey! I have to show
you something.

01:29:59.161 --> 01:30:01.296
Check this out.

01:30:11.339 --> 01:30:13.585
[clears throat]

01:30:13.609 --> 01:30:15.454
Will you go to the
awards with me?

01:30:15.478 --> 01:30:18.781
Well, with us?

01:30:20.983 --> 01:30:23.762
I got fired. There is no
way they're gonna let me

01:30:23.786 --> 01:30:25.430
anywhere near that school.

01:30:25.454 --> 01:30:27.532
All right, so what's the
worst that can happen?

01:30:27.556 --> 01:30:30.268
Are they gonna fire you again?

01:30:30.292 --> 01:30:33.672
Eric, this is about you.

01:30:33.696 --> 01:30:37.709
Okay, this is your time.
I had mine.

01:30:37.733 --> 01:30:40.311
For better or worse.

01:30:40.335 --> 01:30:42.404
You sure?

01:30:44.507 --> 01:30:46.350
You don't wanna miss this.

01:30:46.374 --> 01:30:50.345
Yes, I'm sure, go.
Go, have fun, okay?

01:30:53.181 --> 01:30:55.751
Eric.

01:30:57.419 --> 01:30:58.587
Thank you.

01:31:03.091 --> 01:31:04.159
Let's go.

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:19.518
Hannah, congratulations on being

01:31:19.542 --> 01:31:21.419
number one on the
A-List this week.

01:31:21.443 --> 01:31:23.555
Are you anxious to see if you're
named this year's V.I.P.?

01:31:23.579 --> 01:31:26.324
I've always said there's no way
that I'm going to be V.I.P.

01:31:26.348 --> 01:31:28.760
I haven't been higher than
top three on the A-List,

01:31:28.784 --> 01:31:31.453
and then suddenly I just
popped up to number one.

01:31:34.623 --> 01:31:38.260
Come on, Trent, let's go in.

01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:47.302
Um, I'm gonna see
you guys in there.

01:31:49.137 --> 01:31:52.216
Eric Schultz and I are tight.
We hung out the other day.

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.086
I'm thinking about getting his
face tramp-stamped on my back.

01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:57.479
We're like besties now.

01:32:04.286 --> 01:32:06.698
I don't think they make sense.

01:32:06.722 --> 01:32:08.633
There's always madness in love.

01:32:08.657 --> 01:32:11.135
But there's also
reason in madness.

01:32:11.159 --> 01:32:13.061
Nietzsche.

01:32:14.563 --> 01:32:15.631
You!

01:32:17.432 --> 01:32:19.277
Hey, cutie.

01:32:19.301 --> 01:32:20.645
Hey, Lace.

01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:22.881
You having fun?

01:32:22.905 --> 01:32:25.116
Surprisingly, I am.

01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:27.318
Feels like people aren't
trying as hard this year.

01:32:27.342 --> 01:32:29.845
- Yeah.
- I can breathe.

01:32:34.116 --> 01:32:36.394
How ya doin' with all that?

01:32:36.418 --> 01:32:38.897
How do I know if it's right?

01:32:38.921 --> 01:32:41.323
I don't know.

01:32:42.858 --> 01:32:45.661
But did you need to know before?

01:32:48.096 --> 01:32:51.166
