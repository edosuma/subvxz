Operation Lighthouse.

00:11.735 --> 00:14.152
<i>Re. the unsolved murder
of Gail Vella,</i>

00:14.255 --> 00:17.396
<i>on September 10th, 2019.</i>

00:17.500 --> 00:20.089
<i>The Gail Vella murder
weapon was never recovered.</i>

00:20.192 --> 00:21.435
-Moving.
However,

00:21.538 --> 00:23.299
<i>the cartridge and bullet
were tailored ammunition.</i>

00:23.402 --> 00:24.714
<i>The White Rock unit
is equipped</i>

00:24.817 --> 00:27.234
with the exact machinery
required for this process.

00:29.546 --> 00:31.859
By the time
of our inquiry in 2015,

00:31.962 --> 00:33.792
Thurwell had taken
early retirement.

00:33.895 --> 00:35.414
<i>Believed to be living
in Spain.</i>

00:35.518 --> 00:36.829
I wonder if Gail
discovered the link

00:36.933 --> 00:39.142
between Thurwell and
the Lawrence Christopher case.

00:40.902 --> 00:44.182
I've been looking into other
members of Thurwell's team.

00:44.285 --> 00:46.598
Detective Constable
Ian Buckells.

00:48.324 --> 00:49.601
Inspector Philip Osborne.

00:53.122 --> 00:54.985
I don't know where you're
getting your figures from...

00:55.089 --> 00:58.368
But the figures came from your
own office, Chief Constable.

00:58.472 --> 01:00.784
<i>The Chief's thrown
me under a bus.</i>

01:00.888 --> 01:03.235
<i>I've been fighting his plan
to scale back AC-12.</i>

01:04.167 --> 01:06.066
It's down to you now, Ted,

01:06.169 --> 01:07.688
in whatever time
you've got left.

01:10.967 --> 01:13.211
You want to talk about rats,
ask your boss.

01:13.314 --> 01:14.522
Superintendent Hastings?

01:14.626 --> 01:17.007
Lee told me there was a rat
in our crew.

01:17.111 --> 01:20.425
That rat turned out to be
an undercover copper,

01:20.528 --> 01:21.598
John Corbett.

01:26.362 --> 01:27.915
It's easy as that, Jo.

01:28.018 --> 01:30.090
It's best if you request
a transfer.

01:30.193 --> 01:31.505
Is this personal?

01:33.472 --> 01:35.060
I am Detective
Chief Superintendent

01:35.164 --> 01:37.097
Patricia Carmichael.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.099
<i>Carmichael's taking command.</i>

01:39.202 --> 01:40.410
It's on the Chief
Constable's orders

01:40.514 --> 01:42.102
and we've just learned he
could have been a beneficiary

01:42.205 --> 01:43.310
of Gail Vella's murder.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.703
One more chance, Ryan.

01:57.807 --> 01:58.911
-One more chance.
-Drop it.

01:59.015 --> 02:01.155
-No!

02:18.414 --> 02:20.312
Seven-six.
Hold on. Clear to approach.

02:20.416 --> 02:22.728
Charlie seven-two
to Control.

02:22.832 --> 02:24.144
Vehicle at the scene.

02:24.247 --> 02:26.042
Body on the floor
next to the vehicle.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.354
Oh, shit.

02:31.565 --> 02:34.154
Kate's car's missing.
Request urgent ops.

02:34.257 --> 02:36.501
Alpha Charlie five
to Control, active message.

02:36.604 --> 02:37.743
Request urgent...

02:37.847 --> 02:39.469
Where is Kate?

02:39.573 --> 02:41.057
Seven, six.
All clear, sir.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.370
All arms. Clear to approach.
Search this area.

02:43.473 --> 02:45.475
Check that body
for signs of life.

02:45.579 --> 02:47.788
Repeat, service vehicle,
DI Fleming.

02:47.891 --> 02:49.790
Preserve the scene.
Let them work.

02:49.893 --> 02:51.343
Alfa Charlie five to control.

02:51.447 --> 02:54.312
Active message,
state six of Menton Road.

02:54.415 --> 02:56.106
One police. Major trauma.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.281
Request urgent
paramedic attendance

02:58.385 --> 03:00.283
and full forensic deployment.

03:00.387 --> 03:02.803
Ryan Pilkington, two gunshot
wounds to the chest.

03:02.906 --> 03:05.185
-No pulse. He's well gone.
-Right.

03:05.288 --> 03:08.257
If you hadn't withdrawn
our bloody surveillance.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.672
Given her OCG links,

03:09.775 --> 03:12.157
I think we have to assume that
Davidson, or her associates

03:12.882 --> 03:15.022
are the likely shooter.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.645
DI Fleming was authorised

03:17.749 --> 03:21.028
to carry a concealed firearm
for her own protection.

03:23.962 --> 03:25.239
Five to switching.

03:25.343 --> 03:26.861
DI Fleming's vehicle.

03:26.965 --> 03:29.278
Alpha Charlie five to control
on three.

03:29.381 --> 03:30.555
<i>Control service vehicle</i>

03:30.658 --> 03:32.729
<i>registered to DI Fleming
located Crowlyn Road.</i>

03:32.833 --> 03:36.112
<i>Units report. Vehicle service
mobile radio's abandoned.</i>

03:36.216 --> 03:37.872
<i>Subject is not present
at the scene.</i>

03:37.976 --> 03:39.149
Five two received.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.082
You know her best.
Where would she go?

03:42.222 --> 03:44.085
Sorry, ma'am.
I have no idea.

03:45.294 --> 03:46.743
Issue an order
for the arrest

03:46.847 --> 03:48.883
of Jo Davidson
and Kate Fleming.

03:48.987 --> 03:50.506
Consider them armed
and dangerous.

03:52.611 --> 03:54.510
<i>Charlie seven-six...</i>

03:57.340 --> 03:58.928
-This is the back entrance

03:59.031 --> 04:00.240
to Steve's.

04:00.343 --> 04:01.586
No one's around
this time of the night.

04:05.314 --> 04:08.351
-You sure you can trust him?
-Steve? Totally.

04:08.455 --> 04:10.664
Why wasn't there surveillance
on Ryan and me?

04:10.767 --> 04:11.975
It got suspended.

04:12.079 --> 04:13.253
On purpose?

04:13.356 --> 04:16.290
No. On the orders of
the Chief and DCS Carmichael.

04:16.394 --> 04:17.636
That's nothing to do with me.

04:17.740 --> 04:19.673
Look, I haven't got the
foggiest idea what's going on.

04:19.776 --> 04:21.744
All I know is
somebody's behind all of this.

04:25.334 --> 04:26.576
Kate, you've got to
believe me.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.129
I had nothing to do with it.

04:28.233 --> 04:29.821
No?

04:29.924 --> 04:31.478
You lured me back
to be murdered.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.515
-Kate?
-Didn't ya?

04:39.313 --> 04:41.246
Now look where we are.
Ryan's dead,

04:41.350 --> 04:43.041
and I'm in the frame for it.

04:43.144 --> 04:45.354
I'm sorry, Kate. That's
the last thing I'd want.

04:45.975 --> 04:47.563
You've got to believe me!

04:50.255 --> 04:52.430
-Let me prove it to you.
-How?

04:53.465 --> 04:54.501
Give me your gun.

05:16.281 --> 05:17.489
You believe me now?

05:21.044 --> 05:22.805
Great. Nice one, Steve.

05:26.947 --> 05:29.432
I always worried
you were pretending.

05:29.536 --> 05:32.090
-Pretending?
-You know what I mean.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.679
To lure me into trusting you.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.612
We gotta get a move on.

05:41.927 --> 05:43.895
Steve's been made a bloody DI.

05:43.998 --> 05:46.553
About time
he got a grown-up car.

05:57.633 --> 05:59.359
Yes, I can use a kick.

05:59.462 --> 06:01.291
Uh, sorry, sir. Nothing yet.

06:02.776 --> 06:04.571
DCS Carmichael has ordered me

06:04.674 --> 06:06.538
to update the Operation
Lighthouse evidence.

06:15.858 --> 06:17.066
Sorry.

06:40.641 --> 06:43.126
You still won't answer.
Were you lying to me, Kate?

06:43.230 --> 06:45.853
This is about you, Jo. Not me.

06:45.957 --> 06:47.337
You said you wanted
me on your team

06:47.441 --> 06:48.718
because I'm ex
anti-corruption.

06:48.822 --> 06:50.893
-Were you lying about that?
-No.

06:50.996 --> 06:52.239
I thought it might
help me resist

06:52.342 --> 06:53.896
what they were forcing
me to do.

06:53.999 --> 06:55.725
You never stopped
manipulating the inquiry

06:55.829 --> 06:56.899
into the Gail Vella murder.

06:57.002 --> 06:59.142
They control me!

06:59.246 --> 07:00.489
Ever since
I joined the force,

07:00.592 --> 07:03.871
the more I did their bidding,
the more they had over me.

07:03.975 --> 07:05.977
-I'm not bent.
-Well then, prove it.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.048
You'll get witness protection
if you tell us everything...

07:08.151 --> 07:09.739
Witness protection?
Even to...

07:13.053 --> 07:15.331
No matter who it is,
however powerful,

07:15.435 --> 07:17.437
when they turn,
they get killed.

07:18.058 --> 07:19.197
What chance do I stand?

07:19.300 --> 07:21.164
Just tell me everything
you know, Jo.

07:21.268 --> 07:22.338
Starting with your family.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.444
You nearly said his name.
Tommy Hunter.

07:29.345 --> 07:31.589
AC-12 found DNA
in Farida's house

07:31.692 --> 07:32.728
showing you're related.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.041
So you already know
everything?

07:36.145 --> 07:37.698
Hardly. I need the truth.

07:42.634 --> 07:44.222
My mum was Tommy's sister.

07:45.395 --> 07:48.468
My dad was...
been a police officer.

07:51.781 --> 07:54.163
Right. Well the only way
you're getting out of this

07:54.266 --> 07:55.578
is to prove you're not bent.

08:04.345 --> 08:06.347
It's Gail Vella's house.

08:06.451 --> 08:08.729
You want proof I'm not bent,
you're about to get it.

08:11.111 --> 08:13.078
End of the road, turn left.

08:15.460 --> 08:17.151
DCS Carmichael

08:37.137 --> 08:39.795
Carmichael's on the move.
Not sure what's happening.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.732
Well, let's not wait
for the crumbs, son.

08:52.462 --> 08:53.498
Pull up here.

09:03.370 --> 09:05.545
This place used to be
a front for the OCG.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.100
And right across
the street is?

09:09.203 --> 09:10.619
Terry Boyle's flat.

09:13.345 --> 09:16.486
Shit!

09:33.780 --> 09:36.230
Time to estimate,
six, control. Active message.

09:36.334 --> 09:38.060
Visual with suspect vehicle.

09:38.163 --> 09:40.925
T.A. Market Street.
Travelling at speed.

09:45.067 --> 09:46.206
Oh, shit!

09:49.312 --> 09:50.659
Brace!

09:55.318 --> 09:56.319
Go!

09:56.423 --> 09:58.908
Control, suspect vehicle
failed to comply.

09:59.012 --> 10:00.600
Initiating pursuit.

10:08.469 --> 10:12.163
Six, five. Maintain obs and...

10:32.459 --> 10:33.529
Shit!

10:39.086 --> 10:41.054
Police!

10:44.333 --> 10:46.335
Get out of the vehicle
with your arms raised

10:46.438 --> 10:49.821
and your hands open,
with palms facing towards me.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.310
Police! Get back.

10:56.414 --> 10:59.141
Armed police. Stay indoors.
Get back!

11:00.280 --> 11:02.247
How did they manage
to intercept us?

11:02.351 --> 11:03.973
Something's not right.

11:04.077 --> 11:06.320
Get out the vehicle
with your arms raised

11:06.424 --> 11:09.185
and your hands open,
with palms towards me.

11:09.703 --> 11:10.980
Final warning.

11:11.084 --> 11:12.913
This isn't your fault.

11:13.017 --> 11:15.433
I'll say I forced you
to drive me.

11:15.536 --> 11:17.573
Get out of the vehicle
with your arms raised,

11:17.677 --> 11:21.059
your hands open,
with palms towards me.

11:21.163 --> 11:22.578
Kate, we don't
have a choice.

11:25.788 --> 11:28.688
<i>Control, two occupants
still in vehicle.</i>

11:28.791 --> 11:30.517
<i>Controls eight,
four, received.</i>

11:30.620 --> 11:32.726
<i>We have a visual link
from helicopter.</i>

11:32.830 --> 11:33.831
<i>Maintain sitrep.</i>

11:35.591 --> 11:38.698
...persons exiting
the vehicle now.

11:38.801 --> 11:40.941
<i>Control to eight
four, received.</i>

11:41.045 --> 11:43.806
We're police officers.
DI Fleming.

11:43.910 --> 11:45.290
DSU Davidson.

11:45.394 --> 11:49.018
Hands above your head.
Open them, palms towards me.

11:49.122 --> 11:51.745
I'm a police officer,
going about my lawful duty.

11:51.849 --> 11:52.988
Lower your weapons.

11:53.091 --> 11:55.404
Hands above your head.
Open them.

12:02.273 --> 12:05.310
DCS Carmichael,
you are ordered to surrender.

12:07.865 --> 12:10.246
Jesus Christ!
Steve's in on it.

12:16.977 --> 12:18.876
I'm taking out a pistol.

12:18.979 --> 12:20.740
I'll put it on the grounds.

12:28.126 --> 12:30.819
DI Fleming,
surrender your firearm.

12:31.889 --> 12:34.063
Jo, we're being framed.

12:34.167 --> 12:37.757
This is your final warning.
Lay down your firearm.

12:43.141 --> 12:46.455
Slowly.
Hands where we can see them.

12:49.182 --> 12:52.392
<i>Alpha Charlie
eight four control...</i>

12:52.495 --> 12:54.083
We surrender.

12:54.187 --> 12:55.740
Kate!
-No.

12:55.844 --> 12:57.052
<i>Hand on weapon.</i>

12:58.916 --> 13:00.607
Ma'am, if I may?

13:06.544 --> 13:08.442
This is Superintendent,
Hastings.

13:08.546 --> 13:12.032
I can assure you
you'll be treated fairly,

13:12.136 --> 13:14.069
with the full protection
of the law.

13:15.277 --> 13:18.349
Steve told me some bad stuff
about the gaffer.

13:19.868 --> 13:21.214
This is my fault, sir.

13:26.944 --> 13:29.636
DI Steve Arnott.
I'm unarmed.

13:33.226 --> 13:35.193
You bastard, Steve.

13:35.297 --> 13:37.989
Stay there, Kate.

13:38.093 --> 13:41.130
Take the gun out slowly,
lay it on the ground.

13:41.234 --> 13:42.994
You gave me up. You told them.

13:43.098 --> 13:45.445
Kate, I give you my word,
I didn't.

13:45.548 --> 13:46.480
That's bullshit.

13:46.584 --> 13:47.999
How would they know
what car I'm driving?

13:48.103 --> 13:49.587
Kate, listen to me.

13:50.277 --> 13:52.176
I don't know how they knew.

13:52.279 --> 13:53.902
If it came from me,
I'd be straight with you.

13:54.005 --> 13:55.075
That's how it is between us,

13:55.179 --> 13:57.215
and I'm telling you,
I didn't give you up.

13:57.319 --> 13:58.734
Neither did the gaffer.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.185
<i>DI Arnott,
now with two occupants...</i>

14:04.188 --> 14:05.361
Come on, mate.

14:05.465 --> 14:07.605
I don't know what the hell
is going on either.

14:07.708 --> 14:09.641
Why the Chief's ordered
Carmichael to take over.

14:09.745 --> 14:12.230
But I promise you,
I'll get you to safety.

14:14.508 --> 14:15.613
Both of you.

14:21.722 --> 14:23.207
She's cooperating.

14:23.310 --> 14:24.691
Lay it on the ground.

14:29.765 --> 14:31.146
She's put the gun down.

14:33.734 --> 14:35.702
Come with me.
I'll walk you in.

14:36.185 --> 14:37.428
Get behind me.

14:37.946 --> 14:39.292
You too, ma'am.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.778
<i>Both suspects
now walking towards us</i>

14:42.882 --> 14:44.573
<i>with arms raised...</i>

14:46.299 --> 14:48.611
Check out the old
OCG print shop.

14:49.405 --> 14:51.200
Also, Ryan Pilkington
confessed

14:51.304 --> 14:53.754
to the murder of Maneet Bindra
and John Corbett.

14:56.861 --> 14:59.105
Don't you worry, kid. I'll see
you're well looked after

14:59.208 --> 15:01.279
or, by Christ,
they'll have me to answer to.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.455
Arrest them both.

15:05.732 --> 15:08.908
Put them in forensic suits,
transfer them to dry cells.

15:09.011 --> 15:10.806
Lock the ridge
of the transport vehicle.

15:58.405 --> 16:00.649
You should have shared Kate's
whereabouts with me.

16:02.789 --> 16:03.859
I didn't want to put you in

16:03.963 --> 16:05.274
a difficult position
with Carmichael.

16:11.349 --> 16:14.249
Kate told me Ryan Pilkington
confessed to Maneet's murder.

16:16.527 --> 16:18.184
Pilkington!

16:19.185 --> 16:21.325
He also confessed
to the murder of John Corbett.

16:32.715 --> 16:33.716
Ma'am.

16:33.820 --> 16:37.065
Ma'am, the interviews
with Davidson and Kate...

16:37.168 --> 16:39.412
DI Arnott and I will be
involved, of course.

16:39.515 --> 16:41.793
We know the inquiry
like the back of our hands.

16:41.897 --> 16:43.588
Hmm. DI Arnott,

16:43.692 --> 16:45.487
I've just learned
the vehicle was yours,

16:45.590 --> 16:49.594
and keys to your home were
found on DI Fleming's person.

16:50.630 --> 16:52.528
We've got keys to each other's
homes and vehicles

16:52.632 --> 16:54.634
in the event
of extreme circumstances.

16:54.737 --> 16:57.085
Oh, okay. Yes. I see.

16:57.188 --> 16:59.742
What would constitute
extreme circumstances?

16:59.846 --> 17:02.159
An unexplained disruption
of the chain of command.

17:06.197 --> 17:08.441
Superintendent Hastings
has been informed

17:08.544 --> 17:10.857
of his impending
retirement.

17:10.960 --> 17:14.205
Ma'am, I must protest. That
information was confidential.

17:14.309 --> 17:15.655
And so, to ensure
a smooth transition,

17:15.758 --> 17:18.002
I've assumed command.
So, from now on, DI Arnott,

17:18.106 --> 17:19.279
you'll be taking
orders from me,

17:19.383 --> 17:20.832
or face
disciplinary action.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.735
Is there anything else
you're not sharing with me?

17:31.084 --> 17:33.362
I'm waiting.

17:33.466 --> 17:36.745
Kate said we should check
out the old OCG print shop,

17:36.848 --> 17:38.505
from where John Corbett
worked.

17:38.988 --> 17:40.197
Very good.

17:41.474 --> 17:43.510
I'll report back after
Davidson's respite

17:43.614 --> 17:45.857
to assist me
in interviewing her.

17:45.961 --> 17:47.480
Dismissed. Thank you.

17:47.756 --> 17:48.826
Ma'am.

17:56.834 --> 17:58.077
I'll lead the interview

17:58.180 --> 18:01.632
and you can assist within
parameters set by me.

18:02.771 --> 18:04.255
Do you think
you can manage that?

18:07.810 --> 18:08.846
Very good.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.332
I'll see you
in the morning.

18:12.436 --> 18:15.094
How did you know of Davidson
and Kate's whereabouts?

18:16.405 --> 18:18.545
Oh, we put trackers
in all AC-12 vehicles.

18:19.684 --> 18:20.789
What?

18:20.892 --> 18:22.273
Hmm.
Chief Constable's orders.

18:22.929 --> 18:24.068
Thank goodness we did.

18:24.172 --> 18:27.106
My officers were going
about their lawful duty.

18:27.209 --> 18:28.900
Putting trackers
on their vehicles

18:29.004 --> 18:31.731
was a flagrant
breach of trust.

18:33.215 --> 18:35.044
No, you're right, Ted.

18:36.736 --> 18:38.703
The Chief and I
don't trust you.

18:58.861 --> 19:00.932
AC-12 interview
of acting detective

19:01.036 --> 19:02.417
Superintendent Joanne Davidson,

19:02.520 --> 19:03.935
in the presence
of a solicitor,

19:04.039 --> 19:05.316
police federation
representative

19:05.420 --> 19:07.422
by Chief Superintendent
Carmichael,

19:07.525 --> 19:10.563
Superintendent Hastings,
Detective Inspector Arnott.

19:10.666 --> 19:12.220
You remain under caution.

19:12.323 --> 19:13.462
Following your arrest,

19:13.566 --> 19:15.499
a search of your
registered address,

19:15.602 --> 19:18.018
apartment G-9,
Croxford Street

19:18.122 --> 19:19.710
was carried out
under section 18-1,

19:19.813 --> 19:22.713
of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act, 1984.

19:23.472 --> 19:25.233
Image 17 on screen.

19:25.336 --> 19:27.476
Image 17,
it's a crime scene photograph

19:27.580 --> 19:29.168
captured during
the search of apartment

19:29.271 --> 19:30.859
G-9, Croxford Street.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.619
Who is seen in image 17?

19:34.725 --> 19:36.623
No comment.

19:36.727 --> 19:39.178
Document 22
in your folders and on screen.

19:39.281 --> 19:42.353
Document 22 is a scan of
Samantha Davidson's passport.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.700
Person seen an image 17,

19:44.804 --> 19:46.495
is Samantha Davidson,
correct?

19:47.979 --> 19:50.396
No comment.

19:50.499 --> 19:53.192
Document six in your folders
and on screen.

19:53.295 --> 19:55.746
Document six is acting
DSU Davidson's

19:55.849 --> 19:57.230
police personnel record.

19:57.334 --> 19:59.715
Next of kin is given
as Samantha Davidson.

19:59.819 --> 20:02.062
What is your relationship
to Samantha Davidson?

20:02.166 --> 20:03.305
No comment.

20:03.409 --> 20:06.550
Oh, God, give me strength.
It's gonna be a long day.

20:06.653 --> 20:08.655
We carried out checks
on Samantha Davidson.

20:08.759 --> 20:12.176
Passport shown in Document 22
is the last one on record.

20:12.280 --> 20:13.591
An interim death certificate
was issued

20:13.695 --> 20:16.939
for Samantha Davidson
on the 5th of January, 1996,

20:17.043 --> 20:19.252
by the Glasgow City coroner.

20:19.356 --> 20:21.772
Subsequent inquest
into Samantha Davidson's death

20:21.875 --> 20:23.532
recorded a finding of suicide.

20:26.052 --> 20:27.398
You all right, Jo?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.126
The purpose of our questioning
is not to trigger

20:31.230 --> 20:34.094
painful memories,
but rather to address...

20:34.198 --> 20:36.752
an important aspect
of our inquiry.

20:38.616 --> 20:40.687
Document 33 in your folders.

20:40.791 --> 20:43.311
Document 33 is
a forensic laboratory report

20:43.414 --> 20:46.314
submitted on the 19th
of November, 2020,

20:46.417 --> 20:48.799
relating to DNA deposits
detected during a search

20:48.902 --> 20:51.871
of 29 Stalton Drive
conducted up to and including

20:51.974 --> 20:54.322
the 16th of November, 2020.

20:54.425 --> 20:56.116
Comparison of said DNA deposits

20:56.220 --> 20:59.258
found 100% match with DNA
held on the national database

20:59.361 --> 21:01.363
belonging to Joanne Davidson.

21:01.467 --> 21:03.365
Further comparison
with criminal databases

21:03.469 --> 21:06.092
found a strong partial match
to John Thomas Hunter.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.716
Are you related by
blood to John Thomas Hunter?

21:10.959 --> 21:12.340
-No comment.
-Okay.

21:12.443 --> 21:14.514
Just gave you an opportunity
to declare whether or not

21:14.618 --> 21:17.206
you are familiar with
what we're about to disclose.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.415
If not, you may find

21:18.518 --> 21:21.141
the following information
distressing. DI Arnott.

21:21.245 --> 21:23.661
Document 33A.

21:23.765 --> 21:27.113
Further analysis of the DNA
found at 29 Stalton Drive

21:27.216 --> 21:29.702
detected run of homozygosity.

21:29.805 --> 21:32.014
This is an indicator
of a close blood relationship

21:32.118 --> 21:34.327
between the subject's
mother and father.

21:34.431 --> 21:36.364
With a percentage match
to Tommy Hunter,

21:36.467 --> 21:39.021
it has been concluded
that Hunter was your uncle

21:39.125 --> 21:40.540
and also your father.

21:45.234 --> 21:46.305
No.

21:50.032 --> 21:52.138
No. He...

21:52.241 --> 21:54.451
He was my uncle. That's...

21:55.037 --> 21:57.281
But that's not true.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.806
So what is the truth?

22:05.807 --> 22:08.223
You can see
my colleague's distress.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.707
Perhaps we could
have a short break.

22:09.811 --> 22:11.433
It's a simple
enough question for Acting

22:11.537 --> 22:13.677
Detective Superintendent
Davidson to answer.

22:15.886 --> 22:17.232
No comment.

22:21.029 --> 22:22.858
Okay. I think
we should pause this interview

22:22.962 --> 22:25.447
and return you to custody
until such time,

22:25.551 --> 22:27.069
if any, you're willing
to cooperate...

22:27.173 --> 22:28.554
Ma'am, wait.

22:29.382 --> 22:30.383
Please.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.386
Jo, if you're bent,

22:33.490 --> 22:36.147
fine if you wanna
run the clock down.

22:36.251 --> 22:37.356
We'll charge you,
and with the evidence

22:37.459 --> 22:39.358
we've got, you'll go away
for a long time.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.119
But if you're not bent,

22:42.222 --> 22:44.017
this is your chance
to prove it.

22:45.812 --> 22:48.436
These things we've learned
about your family history,

22:48.539 --> 22:50.852
no one can be blamed
for what they're born into.

22:50.955 --> 22:52.405
Or the path
that it puts them on.

22:53.889 --> 22:55.684
Now's the time
to give your side.

23:04.935 --> 23:06.212
No comment.

23:08.559 --> 23:11.390
You were still only a teenager
when you lost your mum.

23:11.493 --> 23:12.839
It must have been
very upsetting.

23:15.566 --> 23:17.050
No comment.

23:17.154 --> 23:19.225
If you think you're going to
wear us down,

23:19.328 --> 23:21.503
Acting Detective
Superintendent Davidson,

23:21.607 --> 23:24.575
you have got
another thing coming.

23:24.679 --> 23:25.956
DI Arnott.

23:26.059 --> 23:28.337
The search of apartment
G-9 Croxford Street

23:28.441 --> 23:30.270
detected an article
seized in evidence

23:30.374 --> 23:33.204
appearing onscreen
in Image 11.

23:33.308 --> 23:35.862
Image 11 shows
item reference PW-5,

23:35.966 --> 23:37.312
a laptop computer.

23:38.106 --> 23:39.487
Whose device is this?

23:41.661 --> 23:42.869
No comment.

23:42.973 --> 23:45.493
Forensic examination
of PW-5 detected fingerprints

23:45.596 --> 23:48.116
and DNA deposits
relating to one person only.

23:48.219 --> 23:49.428
Said fingerprints and DNA

23:49.531 --> 23:51.153
are a match
for Joanne Davidson.

23:52.948 --> 23:55.330
For what purpose
did you employ this device?

23:56.469 --> 23:58.057
No comment.

23:58.160 --> 24:00.059
Document 56 in your folders.

24:00.749 --> 24:02.579
AC-12's Cybercrime Department

24:02.682 --> 24:05.305
carried out an examination
of PW-5's hard drive.

24:05.409 --> 24:08.239
Their findings are fully
summarised in Document 56.

24:08.343 --> 24:09.931
There are numerous
text conversations

24:10.034 --> 24:12.796
between the user of PW-5
and an unknown user.

24:12.899 --> 24:15.695
Who are the participants
in these text conversations?

24:16.524 --> 24:17.663
No comment.

24:17.766 --> 24:20.113
Our Cybercrime Department
detected an IP address

24:20.217 --> 24:24.117
for the PW-5 user
matching 9 Croxford Street.

24:24.221 --> 24:27.155
The IP address for the unknown
user is located in Spain.

24:28.846 --> 24:30.123
No comment.

24:30.227 --> 24:32.436
What was the nature
of these text conversations?

24:32.988 --> 24:34.093
No comment.

24:34.196 --> 24:36.095
Jesus, Mary and Joseph
and the wee donkey,

24:36.198 --> 24:37.441
can we just move
this thing along

24:37.545 --> 24:39.719
before it drives us all
round the bloody bend?

24:39.823 --> 24:40.824
DI Arnott.

24:40.927 --> 24:42.066
Please refer to the screen,

24:42.170 --> 24:43.447
which shows
a text conversation

24:43.551 --> 24:46.968
which took place on
the 22nd of November, 21:42,

24:47.071 --> 24:50.316
between the user of PW-5
and an unknown user.

24:50.419 --> 24:53.043
Can you tell us what is meant
by the instruction...

24:53.561 --> 24:55.045
"Get rid of her"?

24:56.391 --> 24:57.496
No comment.

24:57.599 --> 25:00.188
You agreed to lure
DI Fleming to her death.

25:00.291 --> 25:02.259
That's about the top
and bottom of it, isn't it?

25:04.019 --> 25:05.089
No comment.

25:05.193 --> 25:06.643
Look,
you could say no comment

25:06.746 --> 25:09.162
till you're blue in the face,
but we know what's what.

25:09.266 --> 25:11.095
DI Fleming made a call
to DI Arnott

25:11.199 --> 25:12.649
just minutes before
an illicit rendezvous

25:12.752 --> 25:15.583
took place between you
and PC Ryan Pilkington.

25:17.654 --> 25:18.793
No comment.

25:18.896 --> 25:20.380
You lured her
to that rendezvous,

25:20.484 --> 25:22.037
and there is the evidence
up there

25:22.141 --> 25:24.626
on the screen
in black and white.

25:24.730 --> 25:27.249
Conspiracy to murder
which, as you know,

25:27.353 --> 25:29.148
Acting Detective
Superintendent Davidson,

25:29.251 --> 25:32.565
brings with it
a life sentence.

25:32.669 --> 25:35.188
And that's before we get
to the rest of the evidence,

25:35.292 --> 25:38.053
which I would describe
as a mountain,

25:38.606 --> 25:41.056
a mountain of evidence.

25:41.160 --> 25:43.300
We haven't even
scratched the surface.

25:50.928 --> 25:52.447
I was asking about your mum.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.039
Yes.

25:58.142 --> 25:59.558
She took her own life.

26:03.941 --> 26:05.287
Yes.

26:07.048 --> 26:08.567
This must be
very painful for you,

26:08.670 --> 26:10.569
but do you think
you can speak about that?

26:13.917 --> 26:17.265
She was born into it,
same as me.

26:18.887 --> 26:21.131
Hated what our family
stood for.

26:22.339 --> 26:24.652
Her brother told me...

26:26.274 --> 26:27.516
what a piece of work he was.

26:27.620 --> 26:28.656
Oh, yeah,
you don't need to tell us

26:28.759 --> 26:31.072
what he was capable of,
believe you me.

26:31.866 --> 26:33.592
He controlled mum's life.

26:34.247 --> 26:36.042
Did he control yours?

26:38.148 --> 26:40.012
Not at first.

26:42.531 --> 26:44.292
My mum was still a girl.

26:44.741 --> 26:46.018
Fifteen.

26:46.812 --> 26:48.537
Raped, she told me.

26:50.747 --> 26:52.749
Though I never knew
the details.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.133
Forced to go through
with the pregnancy.

26:58.755 --> 27:00.239
Tommy sent her away,

27:00.342 --> 27:02.621
back to Glasgow
under her mum's maiden name.

27:04.312 --> 27:06.625
I had no idea
about any of this

27:06.728 --> 27:08.868
until Tommy came looking.

27:08.972 --> 27:10.629
But that was later. Yes?

27:11.664 --> 27:14.633
I'd just turned 16.

27:14.736 --> 27:17.083
He'd heard
I was doing well in school.

27:17.187 --> 27:20.155
Never been in trouble.
Plus, no one knew me here.

27:21.294 --> 27:23.020
He wanted me for the police.

27:23.124 --> 27:25.954
He said, to do his bidding,

27:26.058 --> 27:27.818
to be under his control.

27:37.897 --> 27:39.934
My mum
couldn't bear the thought

27:40.037 --> 27:42.108
of me being with Uncle Tommy.

27:42.212 --> 27:44.283
She knew
she couldn't protect me.

27:45.836 --> 27:47.527
That's why
she took her own life.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.359
Yes.

27:52.429 --> 27:54.707
It's all right. Take
your time. Take your time.

27:55.535 --> 27:57.020
You're doing well, Jo.

28:00.713 --> 28:03.302
So Tommy hid from you
he was your real father?

28:04.959 --> 28:06.236
Yes.

28:07.444 --> 28:09.273
Who did you believe
was your father?

28:14.037 --> 28:15.624
This person,

28:15.728 --> 28:17.868
did he control you
the same way Tommy Hunter did?

28:17.972 --> 28:19.318
We can all see
my colleague finds

28:19.421 --> 28:22.424
this line of questioning
extremely distressing.

28:22.528 --> 28:24.150
In regard
to coercion and control,

28:24.254 --> 28:26.705
my colleague should be treated
as a vulnerable person.

28:26.808 --> 28:27.844
We'll move on. Tommy Hunter's

28:27.947 --> 28:29.293
no longer
a person of interest.

28:29.397 --> 28:31.019
I mean, he became an informant
and was killed

28:31.123 --> 28:34.126
by his own organisation
in 2014.

28:34.229 --> 28:37.198
It wasn't simply that
he was an informant, ma'am.

28:38.889 --> 28:40.063
What do you mean?

28:40.166 --> 28:42.306
Tommy had
cultivated relationships

28:42.410 --> 28:44.239
with corrupt police officers.

28:44.343 --> 28:46.414
But they started
to turn against him.

28:47.691 --> 28:49.382
He felt betrayed,

28:50.798 --> 28:53.939
so he threatened
to expose the mole.

28:54.042 --> 28:57.666
So it was police officers
who got Hunter killed?

28:57.770 --> 29:00.117
They were heavily involved.

29:00.221 --> 29:01.912
As you know,
your former officer,

29:02.016 --> 29:04.950
DI Matthew Cottan,
he orchestrated the plan.

29:05.053 --> 29:06.675
Cottan was a disgrace
to the uniform.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.712
He betrayed the trust
of every single one of us

29:08.816 --> 29:10.058
that he worked with.

29:10.162 --> 29:11.301
So someone took Tommy's place

29:11.404 --> 29:12.681
at the top
of the organisation,

29:12.785 --> 29:15.132
and he gave Cottan
the order to kill Tommy?

29:15.236 --> 29:17.997
Tommy held it altogether.

29:18.101 --> 29:20.689
It broke up
into disparate elements.

29:20.793 --> 29:22.105
Smaller OCGs.

29:22.208 --> 29:23.692
The only thing
that united them was

29:23.796 --> 29:24.935
how much they stood to lose

29:25.039 --> 29:26.557
if Tommy carried out
his threat.

29:26.661 --> 29:28.249
'Cause they relied
on corrupt officers

29:28.352 --> 29:30.527
to carry out many of their
criminal enterprises?

29:30.769 --> 29:32.253
Yes.

29:32.356 --> 29:35.221
And they wanted to be able
to continue exploiting them.

29:35.325 --> 29:37.776
Yes, well, the OCGs, they may
not be working to one man,

29:37.879 --> 29:40.261
but the bent coppers,
that's a different story.

29:40.364 --> 29:41.400
They're a network,
aren't they?

29:41.503 --> 29:43.091
This force has detected
no evidence

29:43.195 --> 29:44.644
of institutionalised
corruption.

29:44.748 --> 29:47.233
We have identified a number
of high-ranking figures

29:47.337 --> 29:50.236
in a clandestine network
of corrupt police officers.

29:50.340 --> 29:51.720
Hypothetical network.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.377
One such high-ranking figure,

29:53.481 --> 29:55.207
once erroneously codenamed H,

29:55.310 --> 29:57.519
we now refer to
as the fourth man,

29:57.623 --> 29:58.693
is he running the show?

30:00.764 --> 30:01.800
No comment.

30:03.284 --> 30:05.286
We're here to examine
DCI Davidson's offending.

30:05.389 --> 30:07.702
-No one else's.
-Alleged offending.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.600
Are you taking
your orders from him?

30:09.704 --> 30:11.188
Who is the fourth man?

30:13.328 --> 30:15.606
-I don't know.
-I don't believe you.

30:15.710 --> 30:17.401
Let's move on. Turning
to Operation Lighthouse,

30:17.505 --> 30:19.610
the inquiry
into the murder of Gail Vella,

30:19.714 --> 30:22.406
opened on the 10th
of September, 2019.

30:22.510 --> 30:25.099
You became senior
investigating officer when?

30:25.202 --> 30:27.618
The following month,
6th of October.

30:27.722 --> 30:28.688
Your predecessor was removed

30:28.792 --> 30:31.415
allegedly due to the inquiry's
slow progress.

30:32.796 --> 30:34.660
How did you
come to be appointed?

30:35.592 --> 30:38.181
I'm an experienced
murder investigator.

30:39.182 --> 30:41.080
Image 24 on screen.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.707
What is shown on Image 24?

30:47.811 --> 30:49.330
No comment.

30:49.433 --> 30:52.333
Image 24 shows
item reference FD-8

30:52.436 --> 30:54.542
seized in evidence
during a search of apartment

30:54.645 --> 30:56.199
G-9 Croxford Street.

30:56.302 --> 30:58.442
Document 39 in your folders.

30:58.546 --> 31:01.860
Document 39 is a photocopy
of the content of FD-8.

31:01.963 --> 31:03.758
You will see that FD-8
contain documents

31:03.862 --> 31:05.449
relating to Operation Lighthouse.

31:05.553 --> 31:06.899
Now these documents
were not present

31:07.003 --> 31:08.211
at Hillside Lane
Police Station

31:08.314 --> 31:10.178
on the 4th of November
of this year,

31:10.282 --> 31:11.904
when AC-12 seized all files

31:12.008 --> 31:13.388
relating to Operation Lighthouse.

31:13.492 --> 31:15.528
Why were these documents
in your apartment?

31:17.013 --> 31:18.359
No comment.

31:18.462 --> 31:20.188
These documents
revealed for the first time

31:20.292 --> 31:22.604
that Detective Superintendent
Ian Buckells noted

31:22.708 --> 31:26.505
that your predecessor and SIO
was pursuing a line of inquiry

31:26.608 --> 31:29.197
that Gail Vella's murder
was a contract killing

31:29.301 --> 31:31.303
carried out
by organised criminals.

31:31.406 --> 31:33.892
However, Detective
Superintendent Buckells

31:33.995 --> 31:35.686
then wrote a memorandum
suggesting that

31:35.790 --> 31:38.517
the SIO was failing
to make any progress

31:38.620 --> 31:41.244
and that a new SIO
be appointed.

31:41.347 --> 31:44.212
Buckells mentions you by name.
Did you ever work together?

31:45.179 --> 31:47.112
Not to my knowledge.

31:47.215 --> 31:50.287
Hmm. So what motivated
Ian Buckells nominating you

31:50.391 --> 31:52.255
to be the senior
investigating officer

31:52.358 --> 31:53.739
on the Gail Vella murder?

31:53.842 --> 31:55.223
You'd have to ask
Ian Buckells.

31:55.327 --> 31:56.397
Yes, well, we did,

31:56.500 --> 31:59.469
and he denies all knowledge
of the documents.

31:59.572 --> 32:01.333
The same way
he still claims no knowledge

32:01.436 --> 32:03.093
of the missing
Operation Lighthouse files

32:03.197 --> 32:05.820
subsequently found hidden
in his service vehicle.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.927
Did you,
or someone close to you,

32:09.030 --> 32:10.204
engineer your appointment

32:10.307 --> 32:12.447
with Buckells
as the convenient stooge?

32:12.965 --> 32:14.242
No comment.

32:14.346 --> 32:16.244
You see, the last thing that
organised crime would want

32:16.348 --> 32:18.419
is Operation Lighthouse
coming knocking on their door.

32:18.522 --> 32:20.110
So they had to put in
a new SIO

32:20.214 --> 32:22.078
to suppress
that line of inquiry

32:22.181 --> 32:24.494
in favour of a random
act of violence

32:24.597 --> 32:27.911
perpetrated by a disturbed
individual acting alone.

32:28.015 --> 32:30.879
A frame that neatly fits
Terry Boyle.

32:30.983 --> 32:33.227
I refused
to charge Terry Boyle.

32:33.917 --> 32:35.332
Well, why not?

32:35.436 --> 32:36.989
There was just about
enough evidence.

32:37.093 --> 32:39.543
Why did you not seek authority
to charge Boyle?

32:42.443 --> 32:44.376
Was it because you
couldn't go through with it?

32:48.173 --> 32:50.416
Is it because you just
couldn't live with the idea

32:50.520 --> 32:53.281
of sending an innocent man
to trial?

32:55.007 --> 32:56.284
Yes.

32:57.527 --> 33:00.150
Good. At last,
we're getting somewhere.

33:00.254 --> 33:02.152
Okay, let's examine
the other recent prime suspect

33:02.256 --> 33:04.258
identified by Operation Lighthouse.

33:04.879 --> 33:06.950
Image 29 on screen.

33:07.054 --> 33:09.504
Image 29 shows
Terry Boyle on the right.

33:09.608 --> 33:12.024
On the left,
Image 29 shows Carl Banks.

33:12.128 --> 33:13.888
Carl Banks
was a nonviolent offender

33:13.992 --> 33:16.270
with lifelong links
to organised crime.

33:16.373 --> 33:17.754
On the night
of the 26th of October,

33:17.857 --> 33:19.894
the Murder Investigation Team
received a tip-off

33:19.998 --> 33:22.483
that an individual who was
almost certainly Carl Banks

33:22.586 --> 33:25.072
had confessed
to the murder of Gail Vella.

33:25.175 --> 33:27.074
As a result
of delays and leaks,

33:27.177 --> 33:29.076
Carl Banks was abducted
and murdered

33:29.179 --> 33:31.147
and Terry Boyle
installed in his place.

33:31.250 --> 33:34.012
PS Farida Jatri was charged
with leaking the information

33:34.115 --> 33:38.395
based on evidence
seized from 29 Stalton Drive.

33:38.499 --> 33:42.192
The address where she claims
the two of you lived.

33:42.296 --> 33:45.023
Did you plant evidence
against Farida Jatri?

33:47.646 --> 33:48.716
No comment.

33:50.787 --> 33:52.168
You've already told us

33:52.271 --> 33:55.378
that you were coerced
into a life of crime,

33:55.481 --> 33:59.002
that you were forced
to mislead and deceive.

33:59.106 --> 34:01.349
Here, now, you have a choice.

34:02.109 --> 34:05.284
A choice to tell the truth.

34:13.948 --> 34:16.123
I planted the burner phones.

34:16.226 --> 34:17.814
Farida's innocent.

34:18.746 --> 34:19.816
Good.

34:20.955 --> 34:23.130
Good.

34:23.233 --> 34:25.684
Who leaked the information
regarding the operation

34:25.787 --> 34:27.237
to arrest Carl Banks?

34:27.686 --> 34:28.825
I did.

34:28.928 --> 34:29.929
And the armed robbery

34:30.033 --> 34:31.690
staged to coincide
with the operation...

34:32.173 --> 34:33.657
You knew about that?

34:33.761 --> 34:37.109
It was a decoy I used
to delay Banks' arrest.

34:37.213 --> 34:38.421
And the mistakes
in surveillance

34:38.524 --> 34:41.458
attributed Detective
Superintendent Buckells.

34:41.562 --> 34:44.703
I manipulated him into those.
It wasn't hard.

34:44.806 --> 34:45.980
And the files
that were planted

34:46.084 --> 34:47.223
in his service vehicle?

34:48.879 --> 34:50.881
I planted those.

34:50.985 --> 34:52.159
What about the witness
who came forward

34:52.262 --> 34:53.746
to incriminate Terry Boyle?

34:53.850 --> 34:55.162
Deborah Devereux.

34:55.265 --> 34:56.370
All I know is we found out

34:56.473 --> 34:59.442
she was a former girlfriend
of DSU Buckells.

34:59.545 --> 35:01.892
And the full statement
from Deborah Devereux,

35:01.996 --> 35:03.515
Buckells set that up?

35:03.618 --> 35:06.725
I don't know if he set that up
himself or someone else did.

35:06.828 --> 35:08.140
Why would he do that?

35:09.176 --> 35:11.557
He was worried the failure
to solve the murder

35:11.661 --> 35:13.318
was making him look bad.

35:13.421 --> 35:15.527
He was desperate for me
to charge someone.

35:15.630 --> 35:17.632
Let's be clear.
You have no evidence

35:17.736 --> 35:18.875
that Buckells was responsible

35:18.978 --> 35:20.704
for Deborah Devereux's
full statement?

35:21.222 --> 35:22.603
Correct, ma'am.

35:22.706 --> 35:24.950
And his desire
to charge Terry Boyle

35:25.053 --> 35:27.090
was born
out of a legitimate fear

35:27.194 --> 35:29.127
for the advancement
of his career?

35:29.713 --> 35:31.957
It appeared so, ma'am.

35:32.060 --> 35:33.614
DI Arnott, can you bookmark
the DI's answer as

35:33.717 --> 35:34.891
a significant testimony

35:34.994 --> 35:36.134
in determining
whether the charges

35:36.237 --> 35:37.618
against Detective
Superintendent Buckells

35:37.721 --> 35:38.688
should be discontinued?

35:43.555 --> 35:44.970
Okay, moving on.
What can you tell us

35:45.073 --> 35:47.075
about the evidence
against Terry Boyle?

35:48.353 --> 35:50.941
The images of Gail Vella
found in his flat

35:51.045 --> 35:52.460
would seem
to have been planted.

35:52.564 --> 35:54.635
To the best of your knowledge,
was Terry Boyle involved

35:54.738 --> 35:56.084
in the murder of Gail Vella?

35:56.637 --> 35:58.190
No, he was not.

35:58.294 --> 36:00.710
To the best of your knowledge,
was Carl Banks involved

36:00.813 --> 36:02.436
in the murder of Gail Vella?

36:06.750 --> 36:08.062
No comment.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.098
Here we go again.

36:10.202 --> 36:12.066
We know Gail Vella attempted
to make contact

36:12.170 --> 36:13.930
with Carl Banks' brother,
Lee Banks,

36:14.033 --> 36:15.552
an inmate
in Blackthorn Prison.

36:16.553 --> 36:18.245
We believe
Lee Banks informed Carl

36:18.348 --> 36:19.901
Gail Vella
was investigating stories

36:20.005 --> 36:22.352
that the OCG
were determined to suppress.

36:22.456 --> 36:24.837
In regards Gail Vella's
investigative journalism,

36:24.941 --> 36:26.356
let's now examine
your movements

36:26.460 --> 36:29.256
prior to your arrest
last night. DI Arnott.

36:29.359 --> 36:31.430
On screen, Image 41.

36:31.534 --> 36:33.570
Image 41 is a map
showing telemetry

36:33.674 --> 36:35.331
from a tracking device
attached to vehicle

36:35.434 --> 36:38.265
Victor, Oscar, 6-9,
Golf, Kilo, Yankee

36:38.368 --> 36:41.613
in the early hours
of the 24th of November, 2020.

36:41.716 --> 36:44.202
Victor, Oscar, 6-9,
Golf, Kilo, Yankee

36:44.305 --> 36:45.858
is the vehicle in which
you were a passenger

36:45.962 --> 36:47.688
at the time of your arrest.

36:47.791 --> 36:50.449
Telemetry location two is the
scene of Gail Vella's murder.

36:50.553 --> 36:53.901
Telemetry location three
relates the derelict premises

36:54.004 --> 36:55.730
of the Kingsgate
Printing Services.

36:55.834 --> 36:58.077
Who's directing
the movements of the vehicle?

No comment.

37:00.563 --> 37:02.737
A forensic search
of Kingsgate Printing Services

37:02.841 --> 37:04.601
has been carried out.

37:05.706 --> 37:07.466
Image 45 on screen.

37:07.570 --> 37:09.606
Image 45,
it's a crime scene photograph

37:09.710 --> 37:12.091
captured at
Kingsgate Printing services,

37:12.195 --> 37:14.370
showing the inside
of the abandoned premises.

37:14.922 --> 37:16.717
Image 46.

37:16.820 --> 37:18.788
Image 46
is an item of evidence

37:18.891 --> 37:20.238
detected by the search team.

37:20.341 --> 37:21.998
Item reference TG-8.

37:22.101 --> 37:24.138
TG-8 is a metal strongbox.

37:24.242 --> 37:27.106
Contents of TG-8
shown in Image 47.

37:28.315 --> 37:30.351
What is shown in Image 47?

37:30.834 --> 37:32.319
No comment.

37:32.422 --> 37:36.633
Image 47 shows item references
TG-11 and TG-12.

37:36.737 --> 37:37.565
A laptop computer

37:37.669 --> 37:39.809
and desktop computer,
respectively.

37:39.912 --> 37:42.018
Forensic examination
of these devices

37:42.121 --> 37:44.434
detected fingerprints
matching Gail Vella.

37:44.538 --> 37:46.091
We believe
these devices were stolen

37:46.194 --> 37:48.300
from Gail Vella's home
around the time of her murder.

37:48.404 --> 37:51.441
Now the Operation Lighthouse
files that you withheld

37:51.545 --> 37:56.239
relate in part to evidence
of the theft of these devices.

37:56.343 --> 37:59.277
This is crucial evidence
you hid.

38:00.381 --> 38:02.418
I was leading
Kate Fleming there

38:02.521 --> 38:04.592
to uncover
the evidence to prove...

38:07.526 --> 38:08.700
Prove what?

38:10.874 --> 38:12.566
That I'm not bent.

38:13.739 --> 38:16.949
Yes, but you hid this evidence
for months.

38:17.053 --> 38:19.020
Not months. No.

38:19.918 --> 38:21.437
That's not what happened.

38:22.576 --> 38:25.130
I only began to suspect
the evidence might be there

38:25.233 --> 38:27.097
after Terry Boyle's arrest.

38:28.513 --> 38:32.310
The print shop had been
long abandoned by the OCG.

38:32.413 --> 38:34.967
Police searches
concluded there 18 months ago,

38:35.071 --> 38:37.591
and it was
right across the street.

38:37.694 --> 38:39.800
But you never ordered
a search of the print shop.

38:43.493 --> 38:44.736
Cyber Crime examined

38:44.839 --> 38:46.738
the hard drives
of both devices.

38:46.841 --> 38:50.017
Passwords were input
to access the stored files.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.536
How were these passwords
being obtained?

38:53.123 --> 38:54.193
No comment.

38:54.297 --> 38:55.298
Well, taking for granted

38:55.402 --> 38:57.127
the involvement
of organised crime,

38:57.231 --> 38:59.198
I'd suggest an employee
in the IT Department

38:59.302 --> 39:01.269
of Gail Vella's news service
was exploited

39:01.373 --> 39:04.031
using bribery, blackmail
or intimidation.

39:05.032 --> 39:06.102
No comment.

39:06.205 --> 39:07.414
Numerous files were detected

39:07.517 --> 39:09.139
relating to Gail Vella's
investigations

39:09.243 --> 39:10.934
into the links
between organised crime

39:11.038 --> 39:12.246
and corrupt police officers.

39:12.902 --> 39:14.282
We have found audio files

39:14.386 --> 39:16.319
of interviews
of Jimmy Lakewell.

39:16.423 --> 39:18.079
We have found research files

39:18.183 --> 39:20.219
confirming that Gail Vella
was investigating

39:20.323 --> 39:22.152
the suppression
of police inquiries

39:22.256 --> 39:25.708
into historic
child sexual exploitation.

39:25.811 --> 39:26.950
And we have found research

39:27.054 --> 39:29.988
confirming that Gail Vella
was digging deep

39:30.091 --> 39:31.886
into police failure

39:31.990 --> 39:34.233
in the murder
of Lawrence Christopher.

39:36.028 --> 39:37.444
Did you know
Gail Vella was looking

39:37.547 --> 39:39.377
into the Lawrence Christopher
murder?

39:39.480 --> 39:40.550
No.

39:41.793 --> 39:43.104
According to notes
found on Gail Vella's devices,

39:43.208 --> 39:45.935
she visited Lee Banks
on 26th of August, 2019,

39:46.038 --> 39:47.212
in Blackthorn Prison.

39:47.315 --> 39:50.802
Now as you know, Lee Banks
is Carl Banks' brother.

39:50.905 --> 39:52.182
It appears
from Gail Vella's notes

39:52.286 --> 39:54.184
that Lee Banks declined
to furnish any information

39:54.288 --> 39:56.463
regarding the murder
of Lawrence Christopher.

39:56.566 --> 39:58.465
We believe
Lee informed Carl Banks

39:58.568 --> 40:01.916
and this was in large part
the motivation for her murder.

40:02.020 --> 40:03.539
Do you really
expect us to believe

40:03.642 --> 40:04.747
that you didn't know this?

40:06.473 --> 40:07.853
I didn't.

40:07.957 --> 40:09.890
I'll give you "I didn't".

40:09.993 --> 40:11.167
One of the suspects

40:11.270 --> 40:12.651
in the Lawrence Christopher
murder is your cousin,

40:12.755 --> 40:14.239
Darren Hunter.

40:15.827 --> 40:17.380
I, erm...

40:17.484 --> 40:19.347
I mean, maybe if
Darren had been arrested,

40:19.451 --> 40:20.418
he would have squealed.

40:20.521 --> 40:21.902
He would have given up
Tommy Hunter.

40:22.005 --> 40:23.559
He would have given up you.

40:23.662 --> 40:25.630
I... I didn't know.

40:25.733 --> 40:28.426
The initial inquiry into
Lawrence Christopher's murder

40:28.529 --> 40:30.911
was led by
DCI Marcus Thurwell.

40:31.014 --> 40:32.222
Do you know that name?

40:34.052 --> 40:35.122
No comment.

40:35.225 --> 40:37.227
On screen, image 75.

40:42.025 --> 40:44.131
Who is shown an image 75?

40:45.063 --> 40:46.409
No comment.

40:48.515 --> 40:50.448
On screen, image 77.

40:50.551 --> 40:52.553
The last known image
of the same individual.

40:53.140 --> 40:54.348
Who is that?

40:55.107 --> 40:56.902
No comment.

40:57.006 --> 40:59.111
Image 77
shows Marcus Thurwell.

41:00.250 --> 41:03.115
What's your relationship
to Marcus Thurwell?

41:05.428 --> 41:06.325
No comment.

41:06.429 --> 41:08.535
Files detected
on Gail Vella's computer

41:08.638 --> 41:10.019
proved that
she was investigating,

41:10.122 --> 41:11.227
not just Thurwell's role,

41:11.330 --> 41:14.126
but the role of other officers
in the inquiry.

41:15.507 --> 41:18.855
Notably Detective Constable
Ian Buckells,

41:18.959 --> 41:21.340
and Inspector Philip Osborne.

41:23.411 --> 41:25.137
The interviewee
has repeatedly claimed

41:25.241 --> 41:27.415
she doesn't know
about any of this.

41:27.519 --> 41:28.693
It's a dead end.

41:32.075 --> 41:33.491
So let's focus on events

41:33.594 --> 41:36.286
surrounding the killing
of PC Ryan Pilkington.

41:36.390 --> 41:39.255
Ma'am,
this is significant evidence

41:39.358 --> 41:41.326
crucial to the wider inquiry

41:41.429 --> 41:43.949
into institutionalised
corruption.

41:44.053 --> 41:46.849
Yes, and I would prefer
to confine ourselves

41:46.952 --> 41:48.091
to the set parameters

41:48.195 --> 41:50.646
of the anti-corruption inquiry
in front of us.

41:51.647 --> 41:52.924
DI Arnott,

41:53.027 --> 41:54.235
if you wouldn't mind,

41:54.339 --> 41:56.168
let's jiffy things along,
shall we?

41:56.893 --> 41:58.101
Ma'am.

41:58.792 --> 42:00.103
On screen,

42:00.207 --> 42:02.692
images 62 to 65, inclusive.

42:02.796 --> 42:07.007
Crime scene photographs
of PC Ryan Pilkington's body.

42:07.110 --> 42:09.250
How did Ryan Pilkington
meet his death?

42:09.803 --> 42:11.011
No comment.

42:11.977 --> 42:14.566
Document 60 in your folders.

42:14.670 --> 42:16.810
Document 60
is the forensic pathologist's

42:16.913 --> 42:19.571
post-mortem report
on Ryan Pilkington.

42:19.675 --> 42:22.712
Cause of death was two
gunshot wounds to the chest.

42:22.816 --> 42:26.336
At post-mortem, two Parabellum
9/19mm rounds

42:26.440 --> 42:28.442
were recovered
from the thoracic cavity.

42:28.546 --> 42:32.135
Ryan Pilkington was fatally
wounded by a firearm.

42:32.239 --> 42:33.792
Describe what happened.

42:36.726 --> 42:38.210
No comment.

42:38.728 --> 42:40.109
DI Arnott.

42:46.943 --> 42:48.462
DI Arnott.

42:52.397 --> 42:55.020
Document 78 in your folders.

42:55.124 --> 42:57.920
Document 78 is a report
issued by neighbours

42:58.023 --> 43:00.336
on the 24th of November, 2020.

43:00.439 --> 43:02.683
Please refer to page two,
paragraph six.

43:03.650 --> 43:04.927
Both Parabellum rounds

43:05.030 --> 43:06.549
recovered from the deceased
show markings

43:06.653 --> 43:09.345
consistent with being fired
from a Glock 17 pistol,

43:09.448 --> 43:12.900
serial number 2-7-7-5-3-1.

43:13.004 --> 43:16.283
2-7-7-5-3-1 is the firearm
lawfully issued

43:16.386 --> 43:18.457
on the 20th of November, 2020

43:18.561 --> 43:20.598
to Detective Inspector
Kate Fleming.

43:22.461 --> 43:24.187
Fingerprints matching
DI Fleming

43:24.291 --> 43:27.605
were also detected
on 2-7-7-5-3-1.

43:28.847 --> 43:31.574
Did DI Fleming shoot dead
Ryan Pilkington?

43:37.615 --> 43:38.823
No.

43:40.790 --> 43:41.826
No?

43:43.897 --> 43:45.312
Who, then?

43:47.694 --> 43:48.729
I did.

43:51.836 --> 43:53.182
Hmm.

43:54.528 --> 43:56.357
That doesn't square
with the forensic evidence,

43:56.461 --> 43:57.427
I'm afraid.

43:58.497 --> 44:01.121
Naturally, Kate's prints
were on the firearm.

44:01.224 --> 44:02.640
She'd handled it repeatedly.

44:02.743 --> 44:05.125
But you'll also have found
my prints on the firearm.

44:05.781 --> 44:07.196
That's correct. We did.

44:07.299 --> 44:09.474
Because she was forced
to hand it over to me.

44:10.717 --> 44:13.064
Ryan had her at gunpoint.

44:13.167 --> 44:15.514
I turned Kate's firearm
on Ryan.

44:18.552 --> 44:21.037
At the time of your arrest,
Fleming had her firearm.

44:21.141 --> 44:22.487
You had Pilkington's.

44:23.108 --> 44:25.214
I returned Kate's firearm.

44:25.317 --> 44:26.629
I picked up Ryan's.

44:27.768 --> 44:30.322
Forensic analysis of clothing
worn by DI Fleming

44:30.426 --> 44:32.946
detected a dense distribution
of gunshot residue

44:33.049 --> 44:34.326
on the right-hand sleeve,

44:34.430 --> 44:36.259
a finding commonly associated

44:36.363 --> 44:39.090
with the discharging
of a firearm.

44:40.712 --> 44:43.750
Kate was in the process
of handing me the firearm.

44:43.853 --> 44:45.855
when I turned the firearm
on Ryan

44:45.959 --> 44:48.271
and discharged
the fatal shots.

44:48.375 --> 44:51.033
Kate's sleeve absorbed
the gunshot powder.

44:51.654 --> 44:53.242
Joanne Davidson.

44:53.967 --> 44:55.347
To be clear,

44:55.865 --> 44:56.970
you are confessing

44:57.073 --> 44:59.282
to the murder
of Ryan Pilkington,

45:00.698 --> 45:02.147
No, ma'am.

45:03.183 --> 45:06.082
Pilkington was about to fire
on DI Fleming.

45:06.186 --> 45:07.221
At the time of the incident,

45:07.325 --> 45:09.499
I was a serving
police officer.

45:09.603 --> 45:14.125
Under common law section three
of the Criminal Law Act 1967,

45:14.228 --> 45:15.367
and Section 117

45:15.471 --> 45:18.301
of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984,

45:18.405 --> 45:20.510
I am permitted
to employ lethal force

45:20.614 --> 45:23.272
to prevent
an imminent threat to life.

45:23.375 --> 45:25.136
My colleague
was acting lawfully.

45:25.239 --> 45:27.621
I think you'll find
that's for a court to decide.

45:31.867 --> 45:34.352
You weren't in league
with Pilkington?

45:34.455 --> 45:38.425
Ryan Pilkington was imposed
on MIT against my will.

45:38.528 --> 45:41.290
I was fully aware
of his OCG connections.

45:42.187 --> 45:43.879
He was there to intimidate me

45:43.982 --> 45:46.260
into misleading
Operation Lighthouse.

45:49.539 --> 45:51.818
So, who was giving
Pilkington his orders?

45:51.921 --> 45:53.164
Was it Marcus Thurwell?

45:54.924 --> 45:56.167
No comment.

45:56.270 --> 45:58.307
We have presented
clear evidence

45:58.410 --> 46:01.034
that you were getting
your instructions from Spain.

46:01.137 --> 46:02.207
We also know
from our inquiries

46:02.311 --> 46:03.761
that Thurwell was in Spain.

46:05.038 --> 46:07.626
Is this the person
running the show? Yes?

46:08.800 --> 46:09.836
No comment.

46:09.939 --> 46:12.562
Marcus Thurwell was SIO

46:12.666 --> 46:14.772
in the Lawrence Christopher
murder inquiry.

46:14.875 --> 46:15.911
Now, we believe

46:16.014 --> 46:19.121
that he deliberately
misled that inquiry

46:19.224 --> 46:21.951
to protect Darren Hunter,
Tommy Hunter's son,

46:22.055 --> 46:25.023
on the expressed orders
of Tommy Hunter.

46:26.438 --> 46:27.785
No comment.

46:27.888 --> 46:29.062
Lawrence Christopher,

46:29.165 --> 46:31.305
he was an architect.
he was a model citizen,

46:31.409 --> 46:34.343
he had his head smashed in
with a piece of lead piping

46:34.446 --> 46:36.379
by a bunch of racist thugs,

46:36.483 --> 46:38.347
one of whom was your cousin.

46:38.450 --> 46:40.556
Superintendent, your
questioning is oppressive.

46:40.659 --> 46:41.591
I'll give you oppressive.

46:42.661 --> 46:43.628
Look, that lad had
his whole life ahead of him,

46:43.731 --> 46:45.009
just like Gail Vella.

46:47.839 --> 46:50.014
They both died
horrible deaths.

46:50.117 --> 46:52.257
I dread to imagine
what they suffered.

46:52.361 --> 46:54.846
Yes. Well, then
give them justice.

46:54.950 --> 46:56.779
Tell us
who's giving the orders.

46:57.953 --> 46:59.161
I can't.

46:59.609 --> 47:00.507
I'm sorry.

47:00.610 --> 47:02.060
Is it Thurwell?
Is it someone else?

47:02.164 --> 47:04.166
-It is Osborne?
-I think we'll leave it there.

47:04.269 --> 47:06.513
Is it the Chief Constable?

47:06.616 --> 47:10.103
Thank you,
Superintendent Hastings.

47:10.206 --> 47:12.484
Joanne Davidson, do you have
anything further to say?

47:13.658 --> 47:15.487
No.

47:15.591 --> 47:17.110
Joanne Davidson,
I've been in consultation

47:17.213 --> 47:19.250
with the senior prosecutor
at the Complex Case Unit.

47:19.353 --> 47:21.079
Nothing you have disclosed
during this interview

47:21.183 --> 47:22.494
has impacted
on those discussions,

47:22.598 --> 47:25.014
and, therefore,
I am authorised to charge you

47:25.118 --> 47:26.464
with the following offences.

47:26.567 --> 47:27.879
Perverting the course
of justice

47:27.983 --> 47:29.570
and malfeasance
in a public office.

47:29.674 --> 47:32.297
I will consult further
regarding conspiracy

47:32.401 --> 47:34.955
to murder DI Kate Fleming

47:35.059 --> 47:37.647
and any charges
relating to the death

47:37.751 --> 47:39.132
of PC Ryan Pilkington.

47:39.235 --> 47:41.203
You will be remanded
in custody.

47:42.135 --> 47:46.242
Interview terminated at 11:43.

47:50.384 --> 47:51.938
You take care
of the custody, son,

47:52.041 --> 47:53.456
just leave this one to me.

48:03.087 --> 48:04.364
I'm sorry.

48:05.020 --> 48:07.746
Yeah. Me too.

48:14.961 --> 48:16.445
You and I both know
that Jo Davidson's

48:16.548 --> 48:19.379
the best chance we ever had
of blowing wide open

48:19.482 --> 48:21.174
the network
of corrupt police officers

48:21.277 --> 48:23.831
in league
with organised crime.

48:23.935 --> 48:25.557
I must have been in
another interview,

48:25.661 --> 48:27.456
because every other answer
I heard was, "No comment."

48:27.559 --> 48:29.492
You let her
off the hook, ma'am.

48:29.596 --> 48:31.287
And as for shutting down
all my questions

48:31.391 --> 48:33.600
-about the fourth man...
-Superintendent.

48:33.703 --> 48:36.430
You are bitter about AC-12
being merged. Who wouldn't be?

48:36.534 --> 48:38.087
It's got nothing
to do with that.

48:38.191 --> 48:40.124
Inquiries into Jo Davidson
will continue.

48:40.227 --> 48:43.127
She has more to reveal.
We will get there in time.

48:45.060 --> 48:46.440
I don't have time.

49:24.754 --> 49:26.066
Sir?

49:27.723 --> 49:31.589
Sometimes you
don't lose, son,

49:33.315 --> 49:35.282
you just run out of time.

49:46.466 --> 49:47.501
As you were.

49:53.645 --> 49:55.130
The Crown Prosecutor
is gullible enough

49:55.233 --> 49:57.787
to consider proceedings
against Jo Davidson alone

49:57.891 --> 49:59.651
in the death
of Ryan Pilkington.

50:00.687 --> 50:02.275
Thank you very much, ma'am.

50:07.590 --> 50:09.385
Two shots to the chest,

50:10.041 --> 50:12.216
double tap. Mm.

50:12.319 --> 50:14.356
Like a firearms-
trained officer.

50:17.152 --> 50:20.086
Davidson's not
firearms trained, is she?

50:22.088 --> 50:23.813
You are, though,
aren't you, Kate?

50:25.091 --> 50:26.471
That's correct, ma'am.

50:30.268 --> 50:33.064
So you'll provide a first
account for my, er, team

50:33.168 --> 50:34.583
and then you're free to go.

50:37.896 --> 50:39.553
I'm not gullible, Kate.

50:41.900 --> 50:43.454
But I am pragmatic.

51:09.031 --> 51:10.205
All right?

51:11.689 --> 51:12.828
All right.

51:12.931 --> 51:14.381
Thought we'd got rid of you.

51:14.485 --> 51:16.176
No such luck.

51:17.557 --> 51:19.041
You sure you're OK?

51:19.145 --> 51:20.215
I know
nobody's coming after you

51:20.318 --> 51:21.492
over Ryan Pilkington's
shooting.

51:21.595 --> 51:23.390
If you ever need
to talk about it...

51:24.702 --> 51:27.567
Thanks, mate.
I appreciate it, but I'm fine.

51:28.533 --> 51:30.604
So what did you
get out of Jo?

51:30.708 --> 51:32.227
A lot less than we needed.

51:33.400 --> 51:35.920
Did she say anything
about her family history?

51:36.023 --> 51:37.473
She told me
her dad was a police officer.

51:37.577 --> 51:39.441
No. Never even gave us
that much.

51:40.166 --> 51:41.443
She's scared, Steve.

51:41.546 --> 51:44.273
After what happened
to Tommy, Lakewell,

51:44.377 --> 51:46.379
never mind John Corbett.

51:46.482 --> 51:48.450
That's why we've got her
on the VPU apprentice,

51:48.553 --> 51:51.073
security cameras
monitoring access to her cell.

51:52.626 --> 51:53.696
So, what now?

51:55.146 --> 51:58.839
Well, we're into the forensics
at the OCG workshop.

51:58.943 --> 52:00.220
And as I'm
the senior detective

52:00.324 --> 52:02.015
left on Operation Lighthouse,

52:02.119 --> 52:03.189
I could be
the point of contact

52:03.292 --> 52:05.260
between MIT and AC-12.

52:06.192 --> 52:07.779
Works for me, mate.

52:07.883 --> 52:09.195
Let's get this job done.

52:09.298 --> 52:10.403
-I'll drive.
-I'll drive.

52:14.303 --> 52:16.857
It'll be in the Red Lion
by 8:00. Nice work.

52:16.961 --> 52:18.135
All right, Chris.

52:18.238 --> 52:20.206
-Ma'am.
-You remember DI Arnott.

52:20.654 --> 52:22.518
Sir.

52:22.622 --> 52:25.245
Don't act like a tit, sarge.
We're all in it together.

52:26.936 --> 52:28.145
What have you found?

52:29.905 --> 52:33.046
There's strong evidence
of workshop in the firearms.

52:33.150 --> 52:34.910
Neighbours have given
a preliminary report

52:35.013 --> 52:37.119
of matches between
the machinery here

52:37.223 --> 52:38.362
and the markings
on the firearms

52:38.465 --> 52:40.640
used in the Jimmy Lakewell
ambush.

52:40.743 --> 52:43.367
Forensics have harvested
prints and DNA,

52:43.470 --> 52:45.783
just waiting on the lab
for any matches.

52:45.886 --> 52:47.716
FC thinks
they've covered the ground.

52:47.819 --> 52:48.820
I'm gonna call off

52:48.924 --> 52:50.512
the forensic deployment
tonight.

52:50.615 --> 52:52.307
Now, you look
at the weight of those.

52:52.962 --> 52:54.240
No way were two OCG men

52:54.343 --> 52:55.689
on their own
gonna move 'em.

52:56.276 --> 52:58.209
What was in their van?

52:58.313 --> 53:00.556
Tarpaulins and rope.

53:02.282 --> 53:04.284
Couple of pickaxes,
bolt cutters,

53:04.388 --> 53:05.906
a couple of wrenches,

53:06.010 --> 53:08.185
socket set, Stanley knives.

53:08.288 --> 53:12.327
Power tools, including
power saws and power drills.

53:13.155 --> 53:14.674
Right.
Let's call out the GPR.

53:14.777 --> 53:15.778
Find out
what's under that floor.

53:16.641 --> 53:18.264
-Really?
-Yeah, really,

53:23.614 --> 53:27.031
Sorry, mate. My DI's
requested GPR for wirework.

53:39.043 --> 53:40.113
Chloe.

53:40.217 --> 53:41.770
Sir, we think
we've found Thurwell.

53:43.081 --> 53:44.842
We'll be right there.

53:44.945 --> 53:46.568
They've located
Marcus Thurwell.

53:47.741 --> 53:49.156
Let's go.

54:08.175 --> 54:09.867
Ah, Kate. Steve.

54:09.970 --> 54:11.144
Spanish authorities
are helping us

54:11.248 --> 54:12.973
in our efforts
to apprehend Thurwell.

54:13.077 --> 54:15.044
The Guardia Civil
have received intel

54:15.148 --> 54:16.701
on this particular address.

55:15.104 --> 55:17.210
Name of God
and his holy mother...

55:23.216 --> 55:25.322
Two dead, sir.
Male plus female.

55:33.295 --> 55:34.710
Thank you, Captain.

55:34.814 --> 55:36.160
We'll leave
the rest to you.

55:47.413 --> 55:50.692
It's just... It's another
kick in the teeth.

55:50.795 --> 55:52.590
Only so much
a man can take!

56:39.603 --> 56:40.673
Wait there, please.

56:58.035 --> 57:00.175
Sorry. Wrong way.

57:01.314 --> 57:03.523
God, this place is a maze.

57:14.016 --> 57:15.362
<i>For too long now,</i>

57:15.466 --> 57:17.226
<i>police officers
have had to serve</i>

57:17.330 --> 57:20.575
<i>faceless,
unaccountable bureaucrats.</i>

57:21.714 --> 57:25.062
<i>We've even had to suffer
political opportunists</i>

57:25.165 --> 57:28.410
<i>trying to win votes
by vilifying police officers</i>

57:28.514 --> 57:31.033
<i>with false allegations
of corruption.</i>

57:31.965 --> 57:34.899
<i>We defend this constabulary</i>

57:35.003 --> 57:36.867
<i>from those
who would obstruct us</i>

57:36.970 --> 57:38.662
<i>in serving the public.</i>

57:40.802 --> 57:44.840
<i>Not only does this force
face enemies without,</i>

57:44.944 --> 57:47.084
<i>there are enemies within.</i>

57:49.086 --> 57:52.641
<i>I will personally see to it
those enemies within</i>

57:52.745 --> 57:55.472
<i>are made to suffer
the consequences.</i>
