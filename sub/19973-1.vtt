WEBVTT

00:46.005 --> 00:50.743
Bull barsh! Whimpering excuses!
Incompetent crap!

00:50.843 --> 00:53.379
Wait a minute, don't print that.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.216
Incompetent crap!

01:00.895 --> 01:04.765
That's all I ever get from
that one lousy county!

01:05.107 --> 01:07.093
I've had to eat so much crow...

01:07.193 --> 01:11.689
the conservationists are claiming
the species is practically extinct!

01:13.616 --> 01:16.727
Governor, sir, from the
standpoint of public relations...

01:16.827 --> 01:21.148
You'll make me look like the same jackass
I've looked like for the last three years.

01:21.248 --> 01:24.443
Face it, gentlemen. You've been here,
watching these press conferences.

01:24.543 --> 01:27.613
What do they ask me about?
Dunston County!

01:27.713 --> 01:30.324
I get my picture on the cover
of <i>Time</i> magazine.

01:30.424 --> 01:34.286
And what's half the damn story about?
Dunston County!

01:34.386 --> 01:37.331
Next I'll be on national TV,
at the convention.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.834
And the delegates and people
all over the country...

01:39.934 --> 01:44.171
what do you think they'll be
thinking about? Nomination? No way!

01:44.271 --> 01:47.550
They'll say, "That's that dumb
cracker who can't even clean up..."

01:47.650 --> 01:49.601
- Sir?
- What do you want?

01:50.361 --> 01:51.637
Governor, I...

01:51.737 --> 01:54.732
- What do you want, Bruster?
- Bridger.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.475
Bridger, yes.

01:56.575 --> 02:00.146
Sir, I have a man outside who may
have the key to Dunston County.

02:00.246 --> 02:03.941
He's on loan to us from the U.S.
Justice Department, New York.

02:04.041 --> 02:08.362
One of the top men in their strike force.
His name is Irving Greenfield.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.448
Wait, did you say New York?

02:10.548 --> 02:13.000
- Yes, sir.
- Bridger, come here.

02:20.391 --> 02:21.884
New York?

02:22.226 --> 02:24.094
Irving Greenfield?

02:24.895 --> 02:26.180
Jew?

02:27.523 --> 02:28.766
Why?

02:29.400 --> 02:32.269
He's the man who broke
the Joey Gallo case, sir.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.722
Why didn't you say so?
Don't make him wait.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.066
Go get him. Bring him in.

02:38.534 --> 02:41.612
Do you believe it? Do you believe that?

02:42.997 --> 02:46.617
Way up there in New York City,
the U.S. Justice Department...

02:46.750 --> 02:50.196
worrying about me,
the poor little Southern governor...

02:50.296 --> 02:52.948
who can't seem to solve his problems.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.326
Up in New York they have
nothing to worry about...

02:55.426 --> 02:59.296
but this Southern governor,
so what do they send from New York City?

02:59.555 --> 03:03.584
They send me down a New York...
Come in, Mr. Greenberg.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.919
- How are you?
- Greenfield.

03:05.019 --> 03:08.714
- Greenfield. Fine. How are you?
- I've been waiting for weeks to see you.

03:08.814 --> 03:12.259
- It's wonderful to have you. New York City?
- Yeah.

03:12.359 --> 03:15.971
New York is a fine state.

03:16.071 --> 03:17.523
The Big Apple.

03:18.741 --> 03:23.070
Been there many times myself.
Saw <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> three times.

03:24.288 --> 03:27.116
Tell the Governor, Mr. Greenfield.

03:32.171 --> 03:35.366
Governor, the Justice
Department has run a check...

03:35.466 --> 03:38.828
and we found out that the whole county
of Dunston is run by one man...

03:38.928 --> 03:40.546
Bama McCall.

03:42.181 --> 03:44.007
We knew about that.

03:44.308 --> 03:48.679
Then you're probably aware he grew up
with a moonshiner named Gator McKlusky?

03:49.313 --> 03:53.100
- We weren't aware of that.
- I didn't think you were.

03:53.817 --> 03:58.355
It seems McKlusky's just been released after
serving 26 months in the state prison.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.942
- It was a second offense.
- Go on.

04:02.201 --> 04:05.863
I want to bust him.
Put him in with McCall.

04:06.664 --> 04:10.234
And if McKlusky cooperates,
we'll have enough evidence to prosecute.

04:10.334 --> 04:14.079
Why would this Gator
McKlusky want to do this?

04:15.172 --> 04:18.075
We have reason to believe
he's still making illegal whiskey.

04:18.175 --> 04:22.880
And a three-time loser has a way
of cooperating, if you know what I mean.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.300
One question. When?

04:27.184 --> 04:28.510
When?

04:29.311 --> 04:32.222
Just in time for the
national convention...

04:33.357 --> 04:37.060
and your TV report on the squeaky-clean
government of Dunston County.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.522
Sold. What do you need?

07:49.887 --> 07:51.997
Since that boy got back
from that place...

07:52.097 --> 07:55.709
he ain't been worth a tinker's damn.
He wants to be like an old tomcat.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.213
He wants to prowl all
night and sleep all day.

07:59.313 --> 08:02.966
Ain't got a lick of work out of him
ever since he got back down here.

08:03.066 --> 08:06.178
Since when you ain't using beet
sugar instead of cane sugar...

08:06.278 --> 08:07.930
like we're supposed to?

08:08.030 --> 08:10.307
- Gator said.
- I've made quality whiskey all my life...

08:10.407 --> 08:14.945
and no place in the book does it
says sugar beet's as good as cane.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.981
Is that what they taught
you up in that place, boy?

08:18.081 --> 08:20.951
What else did they teach you up there?

08:24.087 --> 08:27.032
I think that's what I missed
the most in the morning.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.376
Your bitching and moaning.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.628
You want some breakfast, girl?

08:32.221 --> 08:34.089
I done ate before you got up.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.543
What time did they wake
you up in that place?

08:37.643 --> 08:42.639
You hang around with murderers, thieves,
crooks and Lord knows what else.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.810
Them ain't nice people for
you to hang around with.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.847
I'll try to remember that, Pop.
That's a good idea.

08:49.947 --> 08:53.066
You done lost all your
respect for quality.

08:53.367 --> 08:56.570
Now you name me one thing of
quality that you can do today.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.356
- License plates.
- License plates?

08:59.456 --> 09:01.817
I can make quality license plates.

09:01.917 --> 09:04.611
I was gonna make one of them
personalized ones for you.

09:04.711 --> 09:08.331
- But I didn't know how to spell "senile."
- Senile, am I?

09:08.590 --> 09:10.784
I'm gonna have to take
you down a notch or two.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.454
How'd you like I put a Dutch
rub on you, right now?

09:13.554 --> 09:15.964
Do it, Grandpa!

09:16.098 --> 09:18.842
And you, young lady, mind your manners.

09:19.142 --> 09:22.546
Gator, this child's been
out of school too long.

09:22.646 --> 09:26.391
Two years.
She's beginning to revert to the wilds.

09:26.525 --> 09:29.686
Is that right, girl?
You reverting back to the wilds?

09:29.820 --> 09:33.315
- I ain't.
- I'll tell you what else she needs.

09:33.574 --> 09:38.228
She needs to hang around young'uns
her age, instead of an old codger like me.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.772
And I ain't going to
school this year, either.

09:40.872 --> 09:44.234
You ain't? You is going back to school.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.621
Come September,
you're gonna be in school, girl.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.207
Can I play football?

09:53.176 --> 09:54.203
Yeah.

09:54.303 --> 09:58.298
- And wear pretty little dresses, too.
- Don't like no dresses.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.085
Your momma sure did.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.553
Hello there, puppy.

10:08.025 --> 10:09.768
Hello, chopper.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.857
This is Greenfield.

10:20.871 --> 10:23.156
We're lost.

10:30.756 --> 10:33.583
Down there! I think we got something.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.885
What's that?

10:44.478 --> 10:47.214
- What is that, Pop?
- It's a darned helicopter.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.558
I know that, but who's in it?

10:49.733 --> 10:51.977
Looks like Fish and Game.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.770
Not in a helicopter.

10:56.073 --> 10:58.108
Them's whiskey agents. Come on.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.986
Mr. Greenfield, we got him. That's him.

11:01.161 --> 11:04.239
When you see him,
drop a smoke bomb, and circle!

11:04.414 --> 11:08.535
Do you read me?
Drop a smoke bomb, and circle!

11:22.140 --> 11:24.293
Head the boat towards the marker.

11:24.393 --> 11:25.502
I can't.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.929
- What?
- I said, I can't, sir!

11:28.105 --> 11:31.758
- Sheriff, head the boat towards the marker.
- Can't do that, Mr. Greenfield.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.468
We'll have to go around.

11:33.568 --> 11:36.813
I said turn the boat towards
the gosh damn marker!

11:37.864 --> 11:39.232
Right.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.722
- Hate to lose a load to those bloodsuckers.
- We won't.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.724
Looks like they're serious this time.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.893
- I'll give 'em a run for their money.
- Do that.

12:22.993 --> 12:26.237
Don't you worry, Suzie.
They ain't gonna catch your pappy.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.065
I ain't worried, Grandpa.

12:28.165 --> 12:31.568
If they get too close,
Gator'll hit that jet in his boat...

12:31.668 --> 12:33.862
make 'em think they've
been hit by a tidal wave.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.323
- So don't worry.
- I ain't worried, Grandpa.

12:36.423 --> 12:40.202
If they get too close, I'll shoot
'em in the butt with a full load...

12:40.302 --> 12:42.120
if they mess with us. So don't worry.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.589
- I ain't worried, Grandpa.
- I am!

12:44.848 --> 12:48.051
They're bombing us now.
It's the first time they've done that.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.530
You did it.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.449
You can't get it off.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.787
What does it mean, you can't get it off?

13:16.755 --> 13:21.251
It means we're gonna be here for a while.
Maybe you'd like to call a cab.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.878
A cab.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.797
Cute.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.813
Sir, did you fire that shotgun?

13:49.913 --> 13:53.692
It went off accidental while I was
cleaning it. While I was fishing.

13:53.792 --> 13:54.776
You're a liar, Pop.

13:54.876 --> 13:57.787
- Now take it easy, Tom.
- Don't you call me no liar.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.824
I'll shove this shotgun up your butt!
Get over there!

14:00.924 --> 14:03.702
Don't let him talk like that
in front of my granddaughter.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.462
You rat-faced bastard!

14:08.807 --> 14:11.501
- Take it easy, Bob.
- Don't you hit that child!

14:11.601 --> 14:14.596
I'm not gonna hit her.
I just don't want to feed her.

14:15.605 --> 14:18.842
We got the old man and the
girl over here. This is Cobia 2.

14:18.942 --> 14:23.054
Ned McKlusky, you're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent...

14:23.154 --> 14:24.481
Stop that!

14:25.949 --> 14:28.485
Boat 4 and 5, come in.
What've you got for me?

14:28.618 --> 14:30.320
This is Boat 4.

14:30.912 --> 14:32.906
I'm here with Boat 5.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.824
We got nothing.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.245
It's quiet.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.582
Quiet as a church.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.001
Pretty, too.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.714
That son of a gun
disappeared into thin air.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.845
This if Officer Talmadge
in Boat number 5.

14:57.105 --> 15:00.517
That ain't no ordinary
boat he's got there.

15:01.318 --> 15:04.104
Got some kind of damn rocket on it.

15:06.489 --> 15:07.982
Oh, shit!

15:20.503 --> 15:23.498
Boat 6, come in.
What have you got for me, Boat 6?

15:23.840 --> 15:25.333
This is Boat 6.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.379
Boat 9, come in.

15:40.607 --> 15:44.561
Can anybody hear me up there?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.941
This is the chopper. We got him spotted.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.831
We got him! Damn it, we got him now!

16:13.723 --> 16:17.218
I'm bringing him in!

16:17.352 --> 16:19.095
Chopper, sit down on him!

16:19.854 --> 16:21.131
Do what?

16:21.231 --> 16:23.057
Sit down on him!

16:24.317 --> 16:26.895
Doesn't anybody up there speak English?

16:27.278 --> 16:29.397
Can't you read my lips?

17:25.670 --> 17:28.581
We'll have him in the
chopper in a second.

17:39.476 --> 17:42.387
Oh, my God, he's getting away!
After him, Bo!

17:43.813 --> 17:46.549
What the hell's going on?
Have you got him, or not?

17:46.649 --> 17:49.852
We temporarily lost him.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.354
10...

17:52.572 --> 17:54.023
come in.

18:10.465 --> 18:14.711
It sounds like old Gator's coming.
I guess I better wake up.

18:15.386 --> 18:19.007
Seeing as it's 9:00,
I'll keep on walking.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.386
Fish ain't biting on this side.

18:29.651 --> 18:30.852
Oh, Lord.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.710
That's some Gator!

18:57.887 --> 18:59.756
Come in, chopper!

19:01.099 --> 19:02.959
Don't tell me!

19:03.059 --> 19:05.879
- Sounds like he got the chopper.
- Shut up!

19:05.979 --> 19:07.221
Oh, my God!

19:10.066 --> 19:12.143
That's Gator McKlusky!

19:14.195 --> 19:15.980
Damn rifle!

19:21.744 --> 19:24.655
Gator McKlusky, you're under arrest!

19:25.748 --> 19:27.033
Later.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.934
It's a nice swamp you got here.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.610
Where are they?

20:03.286 --> 20:04.862
We got them.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.326
My name's Irving Greenfield.

20:11.211 --> 20:14.330
You thinking about putting up
some condominiums out here?

20:14.464 --> 20:16.582
I don't find that very funny at all.

20:17.926 --> 20:20.161
- What do you want?
- Some time.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.255
I just did some time.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.874
I know, twice.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.510
- You bet your ass I did.
- Oh, no.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.554
You bet yours.

20:30.021 --> 20:33.182
In fact, you did bet
it twice, and you lost.

20:35.777 --> 20:37.645
What do you want?

20:40.448 --> 20:41.891
Bama McCall.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.901
- Bama McCall?
- Yeah.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.737
I never heard of him.

20:47.622 --> 20:52.360
He's having quite a time in Dunston
County. Prostitution, extortion, bribery.

20:52.460 --> 20:55.246
What makes you think I'm gonna
help you nail Bama McCall?

20:56.339 --> 20:59.909
If you don't want your old man
in jail for moonshining...

21:00.009 --> 21:04.464
and your little girl to be shuttling around
from one foster home to another, you will.

21:05.598 --> 21:09.218
- You think you got me by the short hairs?
- I do.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.882
It's incredible what this
guy's got going for him.

21:13.982 --> 21:16.050
$20,000 in back taxes.

21:16.150 --> 21:18.553
That's all we can prove,
but that's just minor.

21:18.653 --> 21:22.023
But we could use it to put
him out of commission.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.902
- Get the picture?
- I get the picture.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.522
How do I know all that crap
down on that paper is true?

21:29.622 --> 21:32.575
Look, if he's clean, you can prove it.
If he's not...

21:32.709 --> 21:34.702
here's your chance to find out.

22:00.403 --> 22:01.646
Come here.

22:04.324 --> 22:07.026
I'll be back before you
even know I'm gone.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.773
Don't let Granddad sass you, hear?

22:11.873 --> 22:13.282
I won't.

22:18.463 --> 22:20.540
- Good-bye.
- Bye, Daddy.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.764
I'll take over.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.478
You drive.

22:50.787 --> 22:53.406
- Why am I driving?
- I don't drive.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.358
- You don't drive?
- No.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.860
When you're from New York,
you don't drive.

22:57.960 --> 23:01.497
That makes sense. I guess if
you're from Boston, you don't fart.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.036
$3, please.

23:48.136 --> 23:51.172
What's your name, killer?

23:52.098 --> 23:54.592
- Cornelia.
- I like that.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.045
You're new here, ain't you?

23:57.145 --> 24:00.222
I'm new. We've got a new bouncer, too.

24:02.817 --> 24:05.561
That's partly why I'm here.

24:06.279 --> 24:11.484
What's a pretty little thing like
you doing in a joint like this?

24:12.326 --> 24:16.064
- I was Miss Palatka, 1973.
- Wonderful.

24:16.164 --> 24:19.192
Miss Palatka, I wish
you'd do me a favor.

24:19.292 --> 24:22.570
I wish you'd go back there
and tell Mr. Donahue...

24:22.670 --> 24:26.248
that Bama McCall is out
here about the insurance.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.668
Hello, operator, give me the police.

24:29.385 --> 24:33.581
Bama McCall. Insurance.
I can remember that.

24:33.681 --> 24:35.675
- I'll tell him.
- Thank you.

24:38.478 --> 24:42.340
Now we're gonna take a five-minute break
so the girls have a chance to go potty...

24:42.440 --> 24:44.684
and have a little drink.

24:48.905 --> 24:51.607
- You must be the new bouncer.
- Yeah.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.943
Son, you're a healthy-looking mother.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.821
Look at them arms!

24:57.538 --> 24:59.732
- Little warm, ain't it?
- Yeah.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.618
My name is Bama McCall.

25:02.752 --> 25:06.280
And I don't usually come by
here to make collections...

25:06.380 --> 25:08.916
but I just wanted to come by...

25:09.300 --> 25:11.293
and say hello.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.133
Good-bye!

25:26.108 --> 25:27.810
Hello, ladies.

25:28.528 --> 25:31.647
Donahue, that's a couple pretty
good bouncers you got there.

25:32.490 --> 25:35.818
I just bounced one off of the wall
and one through the window for you.

25:36.994 --> 25:38.821
That's a good one, Mr. McCall.

25:41.457 --> 25:45.194
But I'm only the manager here.
The people in Detroit own the club.

25:45.294 --> 25:48.664
And they have to have authorization
for anything they pay out.

25:49.090 --> 25:50.450
You know what?

25:50.550 --> 25:52.201
This damn place is a firetrap.

25:52.301 --> 25:55.037
I called them and said you said that.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.874
Are you telling me that your
associates up in Detroit...

25:57.974 --> 26:01.218
are all that inconsiderate?
Is that what you're telling me?

26:02.853 --> 26:04.930
That's a shame!

26:07.316 --> 26:08.885
I could call them back.

26:08.985 --> 26:11.562
I could call them back right now!

26:16.450 --> 26:19.320
We better be getting on over
to the Southside Shuffle.

26:19.537 --> 26:21.489
Can't you see I'm eating my supper?

26:54.822 --> 26:59.268
Look at this. I'm riding with a nut named
Gator, looking for a putz named Bama!

26:59.368 --> 27:01.821
Don't you people have regular names?

27:01.954 --> 27:04.941
You mean intelligent names,
like you've got in New York City?

27:05.041 --> 27:06.776
Like "Yogi"?

27:06.876 --> 27:09.078
I know. Cute.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.710
Do you have to drive so fast?

27:17.678 --> 27:20.130
I don't get a chance
like this very often.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.676
A cop stops me,
I just flash him my badge.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.970
What badge?

27:26.604 --> 27:28.089
Your badge.

27:28.189 --> 27:32.685
- We're undercover men, goddamn it!
- Oh, shit! Undercover.

27:33.569 --> 27:35.980
You, undercover in Dunston.

27:36.739 --> 27:40.609
You're gonna stick out in Dunston,
like a bagel in a bucket of grits.

27:51.462 --> 27:54.456
- Mighty pretty city.
- Is that Dunston?

27:55.508 --> 27:57.293
No, it's Newark.

28:01.097 --> 28:03.457
- I think I'm losing control.
- Why?

28:03.557 --> 28:05.885
I'm beginning to think you're funny.

28:25.830 --> 28:28.524
Yours is a little lumpy,
but mine doesn't look too bad.

28:28.624 --> 28:31.911
Yours doesn't look too bad?
That's pretty funny.

28:33.003 --> 28:34.830
Almost as funny as Newark.

28:36.298 --> 28:39.001
Pretty lumpy? I'd have to be crazy.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.212
On the other hand, I don't know.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.082
What's going on?

28:45.182 --> 28:47.384
- This is where you're staying.
- Why?

28:47.977 --> 28:49.879
You're undercover, aren't you?

28:49.979 --> 28:52.590
Nobody'd look for you in
a crappy place like this.

28:52.690 --> 28:54.133
Where are you gonna stay?

28:54.233 --> 28:57.061
You didn't expect me to
stay in a dump like this?

28:57.361 --> 28:58.938
Come on!

30:11.227 --> 30:14.096
Hey, folks, here comes the
Dunston High School band.

30:33.958 --> 30:36.160
We won, didn't we, folks?

30:38.838 --> 30:41.490
Chief Billy Joe Williams and
the police department...

30:41.590 --> 30:44.418
made out a donation for the campaign.

30:44.635 --> 30:48.380
Now, folks, you like what we got
going in Dunston, don't you?

30:51.141 --> 30:52.676
Do you folks...

30:54.270 --> 30:57.798
Do you know the difference between
Uncle Sam, a rooster and an old maid?

30:57.898 --> 31:01.385
Uncle Sam says, "Yankee-doodle-do,"
the rooster says, "Cock-a-doodle-do"...

31:01.485 --> 31:04.521
and an old maid says,
"Any-old-dude'll-do."

31:14.874 --> 31:19.320
When that TV camera starts showing us,
I want you all to show your best...

31:19.420 --> 31:20.863
'cause you got the best.

31:20.963 --> 31:24.583
And we're gonna have the best
city south of Baltimore!

31:26.844 --> 31:30.047
Who in the hell gives a damn
what's north of Baltimore?

31:33.851 --> 31:36.879
Hey, you tyke there,
come down here, sweetie!

31:36.979 --> 31:41.842
Miss Cavanaugh, you're welcome to stay,
as long as you don't make a disturbance.

31:41.942 --> 31:44.678
We can't have you interfering
with the festivities...

31:44.778 --> 31:47.389
with all your yelling
and your screaming.

31:47.489 --> 31:50.434
Now I'm gonna have to
escort you out of the park.

31:50.534 --> 31:54.396
Patrick McGinnin, I have known you
since you were 11 years old...

31:54.496 --> 31:56.732
and you were a sweet young man...

31:56.832 --> 31:58.484
and your father a Catholic priest.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.828
- Baptist minister.
- Right.

32:01.295 --> 32:03.614
I still think you're
a sweet young man...

32:03.714 --> 32:06.542
but you are not escorting me anywhere.

32:07.635 --> 32:09.002
Sorry.

32:09.261 --> 32:12.673
Look, Miss Cavanaugh,
I don't want to have to arrest you.

32:12.932 --> 32:15.709
Patrick, you must understand
that I'm not hitting you.

32:15.809 --> 32:18.754
I am hitting Mayor Caffrey
and all his corruption.

32:18.854 --> 32:21.557
And here's another blow for freedom.

32:23.525 --> 32:28.222
And what about unemployment?
What's Caffrey gonna do about that?

32:28.322 --> 32:31.308
What's he gonna do about the
poor and underprivileged?

32:31.408 --> 32:35.104
You stick me in the eye with that sign,
you're gonna be in real trouble.

32:35.204 --> 32:37.398
I'm a citizen. I've got my rights.

32:37.498 --> 32:40.075
I'd like to stick it someplace else!

32:40.709 --> 32:41.652
I just feel happy.

32:41.752 --> 32:45.865
I'm so grateful for all you
folks coming out here...

32:45.965 --> 32:48.584
You don't believe all that crap, do you?

32:53.305 --> 32:54.623
Gator!

32:54.723 --> 32:57.593
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I came down to...

33:03.774 --> 33:05.350
- Hi, Bama!
- Hi, cutie!

33:06.610 --> 33:08.262
- What's your name?
- Gator.

33:08.362 --> 33:10.189
- Alligator?
- Yeah.

33:10.572 --> 33:13.317
Where have you been all my life?

33:14.743 --> 33:16.987
All your life? In prison.

33:19.373 --> 33:21.074
See you later, Alligator!

33:21.458 --> 33:24.153
You know how long it's
been since I've seen you?

33:24.253 --> 33:27.289
- It was what? Owney Matson's dirt track?
- Yeah.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.242
That ain't it.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.954
It was the night we was drinking
at that joint up in Willow Springs.

33:34.054 --> 33:36.916
That's when it was. What you been doing?

33:37.016 --> 33:38.800
- Time.
- Time?

33:40.269 --> 33:42.095
What're you doing hanging around here?

33:42.938 --> 33:45.049
I heard you was the cock
of the walk down here.

33:45.149 --> 33:47.738
So I just come out to
find out if it was true.

33:47.839 --> 33:49.720
I am. Bones!

33:49.820 --> 33:53.815
Meet the dearest friend I got in the world.
Mr. Gator McKlusky, Bones.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.101
Ask him why they call him Bones.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.895
Why do they call you Bones?

33:57.995 --> 33:59.780
'Cause I tell 'em to.

34:02.458 --> 34:04.652
- Right.
- Bones, go get Mayor Bob.

34:04.752 --> 34:07.329
Bring him over here.
I want him to meet Gator.

34:08.172 --> 34:10.998
Got a very intelligent look about him.

34:11.132 --> 34:14.043
- He's my social secretary.
- I see.

34:14.969 --> 34:18.081
- Do you remember Coach Ferguson?
- Sure.

34:18.181 --> 34:19.466
Baldy?

34:20.601 --> 34:24.054
Do you remember the night
we were playing for Hokey?

34:24.396 --> 34:28.225
And we won nine straight ball games?
We thought we was a bunch of killers.

34:28.817 --> 34:31.136
And for Hokey, it was
just cleaning our plough.

34:31.235 --> 34:34.523
Running us clean out of the stadium.
We went into half time...

34:58.514 --> 35:00.040
Wonder what old Skeeter's doing?

35:00.140 --> 35:02.301
Probably still making
that same dumb speech.

35:26.708 --> 35:29.703
My God, I feel like I've
died and gone to heaven.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.125
How do you feel, Gator?

35:36.677 --> 35:39.588
I feel like I'm at Mount Rushmore.

35:55.362 --> 35:57.022
Hello, there.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.608
My name's Smiley.

36:00.409 --> 36:02.277
- No shit.
- Nope.

36:04.538 --> 36:07.616
Understand you just got
out of the clinker?

36:08.167 --> 36:09.451
Yeah.

36:10.586 --> 36:12.662
I ain't never been...

36:13.589 --> 36:18.210
but I hear there's a whole bunch of queers
just crawling all over your body up there.

36:21.263 --> 36:23.548
That's what they say.

36:24.850 --> 36:28.178
Every so often you hear
a yell or two in the night?

36:32.149 --> 36:33.392
Yeah.

36:34.318 --> 36:35.761
I know the sound.

36:35.861 --> 36:38.680
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah!

36:38.780 --> 36:40.232
Hello, Pogie!

36:40.365 --> 36:41.942
Now look.

36:45.662 --> 36:48.440
Fine. Look.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.859
Pogie, I want you to
do something for me.

36:50.959 --> 36:55.497
I want you to check on a
guy named Gator McKlusky.

36:56.757 --> 36:59.709
I'm gonna show you how
we do a little collecting.

37:01.470 --> 37:04.798
I'm gonna give you the Black
section to start with.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.844
There's only two things you've
gotta remember about Blacks.

37:09.228 --> 37:13.223
And that's this. That one day
they can be real easy...

37:14.399 --> 37:16.351
and then the next day...

37:17.569 --> 37:19.271
they can be...

37:20.155 --> 37:21.690
bad.

37:30.332 --> 37:32.576
The best I can remember...

37:32.751 --> 37:35.787
you always were a little
color-blind, weren't you?

37:37.214 --> 37:39.040
What the hell is that?

37:40.175 --> 37:43.170
That's to make them Blacks easy.

38:04.074 --> 38:06.318
Would you?

38:07.119 --> 38:08.987
In a New York minute.

38:18.714 --> 38:21.450
- Mr. Bama.
- Big George.

38:21.550 --> 38:24.461
Go in there and tell J.J.
I've come for my sugar.

38:34.062 --> 38:37.557
That is real sweet. I love that song.

38:46.491 --> 38:48.777
You're getting my shits on.

38:49.453 --> 38:52.564
Now let's cut the crap,
and you go do what I told you to do.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.616
Yes, boss!

39:02.674 --> 39:04.543
The man from Glad is here.

39:04.718 --> 39:07.212
- You didn't make him mad, did you?
- I hope so.

39:08.597 --> 39:11.007
Black is beautiful. I love it.

39:11.308 --> 39:13.885
- You go tell him you're gone.
- I'm gone!

39:28.617 --> 39:30.151
Wait a minute.

39:30.369 --> 39:33.063
God almighty, what about
the laws in this town?

39:33.163 --> 39:36.366
I got a permit to carry this thing, son.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.996
Where are the cops at?

39:41.129 --> 39:42.747
Right there.

39:53.725 --> 39:54.710
Shit.

39:54.810 --> 39:58.346
Every time he comes around,
he blows up something.

40:09.116 --> 40:10.650
Well, J.J.

40:10.826 --> 40:12.319
Hi, Bama.

40:12.994 --> 40:15.272
Where are you going?
You owe me a little money.

40:15.372 --> 40:18.033
Just going out to get
my tire fixed, man.

40:18.792 --> 40:21.236
You owe me $500, J.J.

40:21.336 --> 40:25.248
Oh, man, slipped my mind.
I got it right here in my pocket.

40:34.474 --> 40:38.587
Now, son, that's a thing of beauty
and a joy to behold. Is that gorgeous?

40:38.687 --> 40:43.892
Sometimes my vocabulary just ain't
adequate to describe the beauty...

40:44.359 --> 40:46.645
and the grandeur of it all.

40:47.237 --> 40:49.556
You gotta get used to this high living.

40:49.656 --> 40:51.566
I don't know if I can stand it.

40:51.867 --> 40:54.069
- Is he supposed to do that?
- Yeah.

40:55.078 --> 40:57.614
For whose benefit, mine or his?

40:59.708 --> 41:01.943
All right, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

41:02.043 --> 41:05.163
Now I'm gonna start you
out at $400 a week.

41:05.380 --> 41:08.083
But, now, you can't take
nothing out on the bag.

41:08.717 --> 41:10.585
That sounds good.

41:11.928 --> 41:14.839
- Telephone, Mr. McCall.
- Thank you, Tom.

41:15.932 --> 41:17.300
Hello.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.928
Pogie! Yeah.

41:21.396 --> 41:24.391
It's your dime, you do the talking.

41:25.901 --> 41:27.769
Super. Okay.

41:29.362 --> 41:31.064
I love it.

41:31.698 --> 41:33.566
Okay. See you, Pog.

41:34.409 --> 41:37.062
Now what's it gonna be? Gonna be steak?

41:37.162 --> 41:39.356
You want lobster? Maybe you want both?

41:39.456 --> 41:41.566
I'd like to speak to you for a minute.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.034
Aggie:

41:43.210 --> 41:46.287
Gator McKlusky, say hello
to Agatha Maybank.

41:46.755 --> 41:50.125
She's the star of Dunston
County television.

41:50.634 --> 41:51.952
Sit down, Aggie.

41:52.052 --> 41:55.171
- You had my series cancelled.
- Your what?

41:55.764 --> 41:59.334
The documentary show on poverty
that we were doing in Dunston County.

41:59.434 --> 42:00.627
Who told you that?

42:00.727 --> 42:03.471
- Caffrey's office.
- Caffrey's office.

42:05.524 --> 42:10.145
I'm afraid you might have overestimated
my influence a little bit.

42:10.529 --> 42:12.772
But then, on the other hand...

42:13.198 --> 42:17.360
nobody likes to watch that junk on TV,
anyway. It's depressing, ain't it?

42:19.079 --> 42:22.607
Mr. McCall, television is
independently owned...

42:22.707 --> 42:27.028
and there's an FCC regulation that forbids
interference by local political authorities.

42:27.128 --> 42:28.405
Honey...

42:28.505 --> 42:31.366
if you want to have a drink with us,
you're welcome to stay.

42:31.466 --> 42:35.920
But if you come over here to piss
and moan at me, excuse my French...

42:36.471 --> 42:40.300
then I don't want to hear your women's lib,
poverty-program bullshit!

42:40.767 --> 42:43.795
Not while I'm enjoying my
meal here with my friend...

42:43.895 --> 42:46.131
and paying for it with my own money.

42:46.231 --> 42:47.299
I see.

42:47.399 --> 42:50.802
But you are welcome to
stay and have a drink.

42:50.902 --> 42:54.514
If that's what they taught you
up there at Vassar or NBC.

42:54.614 --> 42:59.027
No, but they did teach me where
the Civil Liberties Union is located.

43:00.412 --> 43:02.071
Mr. McKlusky.

43:06.668 --> 43:08.119
Nice ass.

43:09.212 --> 43:10.914
A little uppity.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.648
Very pretty.

43:38.992 --> 43:40.527
Thank you.

43:41.786 --> 43:43.154
You the man?

43:45.123 --> 43:46.324
Yeah.

43:47.042 --> 43:49.536
They said a new one was coming.

43:50.462 --> 43:52.614
I'm about as new as you can get.

43:52.714 --> 43:55.116
Policy numbers wasn't no good this week.

43:55.216 --> 43:58.628
I made a little change on the horses.
Some on the dogs.

44:03.975 --> 44:06.386
Come on, let me get my book.

44:08.521 --> 44:10.223
And my money.

44:14.319 --> 44:16.771
You kids, go on, slide on outta here.

44:18.073 --> 44:19.274
Now!

44:22.869 --> 44:25.780
It's all here, mister. You can count it.

44:26.665 --> 44:27.816
I don't have to.

44:27.916 --> 44:31.661
I don't want no trouble with Mr. McCall.
I can't afford no fire.

44:34.422 --> 44:36.082
There ain't gonna be no fire.

44:37.467 --> 44:38.668
Okay.

44:41.012 --> 44:43.840
Hey, sign the paper, man.

44:53.608 --> 44:54.934
Thank you.

45:05.662 --> 45:07.906
- Where is Bama?
- He's inside.

45:35.316 --> 45:37.886
Hi. I'm Tinker.

45:37.986 --> 45:41.356
I'm Gator. Is Bama around?

45:41.906 --> 45:43.691
He's in there.

45:44.451 --> 45:46.361
He's always in there.

45:48.705 --> 45:50.365
Thank you.

46:06.890 --> 46:09.842
Don't you ever knock
on the door or nothing?

46:10.643 --> 46:14.389
I mean, you could've caught a
fellow with his britches down.

46:14.522 --> 46:15.848
Sorry.

46:16.191 --> 46:18.518
I want to talk to you alone, okay?

46:20.069 --> 46:21.729
You mean her?

46:24.282 --> 46:26.275
Son, we're alone.

46:27.577 --> 46:28.937
What's she on?

46:29.037 --> 46:32.448
She's on Quaaludes. She's on Mandrax.

46:33.041 --> 46:35.410
She's on Parest. She's on coke.

46:37.962 --> 46:39.614
You name it, son.

46:39.714 --> 46:42.834
I mean, if they make it,
then that chick'll take it.

46:44.636 --> 46:46.204
She can't be more than 15.

46:46.304 --> 46:49.590
Hell, I don't go by age,
I go by weight, anyway.

46:52.519 --> 46:56.214
I mean, your momma and my momma
both done married, done had young'uns...

46:56.314 --> 47:00.518
and the whole shooting match when they
wasn't a damn bit older than she was.

47:03.071 --> 47:04.772
Gator, look.

47:05.031 --> 47:08.935
Son, I don't hook these chicks.
I don't hustle these chicks.

47:09.035 --> 47:12.280
I damn sure don't go out on the
street and drag them in here.

47:12.914 --> 47:15.616
They come in to pay
for that habit they got.

47:15.834 --> 47:19.245
There's money,
and then there's money, Bama.

47:20.880 --> 47:25.084
- I didn't make the world the way it was.
- No, you just collect off it.

47:26.094 --> 47:28.747
Now look, son, they had
a man before me...

47:28.847 --> 47:31.966
and they're gonna have
a man after me. Right?

47:34.727 --> 47:37.472
Come here a minute.
I want to show you something.

47:39.315 --> 47:43.102
You're gonna love that. Sit down.

47:47.115 --> 47:49.776
- How's your old man doing?
- Fine.

47:50.285 --> 47:52.195
How old is he now?

47:52.829 --> 47:55.531
- 74.
- He's 74?

47:58.835 --> 48:02.655
He's about lived his three score
and ten, ain't he, like the Bible said?

48:02.755 --> 48:05.792
Pretty soon he'll be gone.
He'll be dead.

48:08.177 --> 48:10.088
And in the meantime...

48:11.139 --> 48:14.209
what you can hold in
your hand, you got, son.

48:14.309 --> 48:16.844
And what you can taste, you got.

48:18.062 --> 48:21.758
And all the poontang you get,
that's yours, see.

48:21.858 --> 48:24.560
Nobody can take that away from you.

48:27.238 --> 48:29.732
I hate to be the one to tell you this.

48:30.325 --> 48:32.568
But everybody out there...

48:33.119 --> 48:35.730
everybody's a taker. I mean it.

48:35.830 --> 48:40.034
From the top, son, to the bottom.
They're all takers.

48:41.169 --> 48:45.206
And you have got to reach out there,
and you've got to take it.

48:47.175 --> 48:48.876
If you don't...

48:49.844 --> 48:53.798
somebody's gonna reach out there
like that, and they gonna take you.

48:54.724 --> 48:56.509
Does that make sense?

49:00.688 --> 49:02.890
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

49:15.453 --> 49:19.657
Before you is a young, beautiful,
tender flower of passion.

49:22.710 --> 49:24.745
So I'll tell you what.

49:26.047 --> 49:27.949
You get over there...

49:28.049 --> 49:33.254
I'll bet that pretty little thing will make
you forget whatever's gnawing at you.

49:34.931 --> 49:38.593
Come on, sport, you need to get
your pipes cleaned out anyway.

49:41.729 --> 49:45.183
It's my Tinker.
Here you go, killer, hold that.

49:48.069 --> 49:50.688
You all be nice to one another now.

49:51.072 --> 49:53.399
And I'll see you later. Bye!

50:12.635 --> 50:14.879
Don't I know you from somewhere?

50:17.015 --> 50:19.467
From the political rally.

50:21.144 --> 50:22.678
Alligator.

50:29.110 --> 50:30.311
Yeah.

50:33.031 --> 50:35.233
Don't you find me pretty?

50:36.993 --> 50:38.194
Yeah.

50:38.911 --> 50:41.322
I'm thinking of adopting you.

50:42.623 --> 50:44.659
Why are you so far away?

50:46.377 --> 50:47.954
Come here.

50:51.257 --> 50:54.460
I'll treat you like a king.

50:56.637 --> 50:59.090
Why would you want to do that?

51:04.395 --> 51:06.722
I could do things.

51:11.527 --> 51:13.479
Certain things.

52:09.418 --> 52:11.037
How old are you?

52:14.590 --> 52:16.542
Fifteen and a half.

52:19.345 --> 52:20.880
Fifteen and a half?

52:23.599 --> 52:26.510
Ain't nobody up here older than 16.

52:28.396 --> 52:30.556
Bama likes it that way.

52:36.737 --> 52:39.474
Bridger, I won't let you down.

52:39.574 --> 52:43.194
I never have let anyone down.
Just don't worry.

52:53.588 --> 52:56.582
Bridger, he's busy
making the collection.

52:57.425 --> 53:01.379
Look, it takes time to build a case
like this. You know, and I know.

53:01.512 --> 53:03.422
I'm at his...

53:06.934 --> 53:08.928
I'm at my hotel now.

53:11.147 --> 53:12.348
Nice.

53:14.609 --> 53:16.135
Excuse me, sir.

53:16.235 --> 53:19.013
Are you a registered
guest at this hotel?

53:19.113 --> 53:20.731
I'm not.

53:21.908 --> 53:23.943
Then you'll have to leave.

53:26.370 --> 53:27.571
Now.

53:28.289 --> 53:30.658
Bridger, I'll get back to you!

53:36.047 --> 53:37.665
I'll see you. $400.

53:38.174 --> 53:39.375
Call.

53:41.385 --> 53:44.130
Them fours look kind of small,
now, don't they?

53:56.484 --> 53:58.553
Bama, I want to talk
to you a minute, okay?

53:58.653 --> 54:00.521
Damn, Gator!

54:01.155 --> 54:03.190
I'm gonna have to change
your name to Rabbit.

54:09.205 --> 54:13.576
Son, don't interrupt me
while I'm winning at poker.

54:18.422 --> 54:19.707
Now!

54:22.969 --> 54:24.662
I believe you're serious.

54:24.762 --> 54:27.631
Smiley, take Gator in the bar.

54:29.308 --> 54:30.509
Bones.

54:31.936 --> 54:35.931
Take care of this. Fellas, excuse me.
Sugar, I'll be back in a minute.

54:44.490 --> 54:45.900
Chalky.

54:56.627 --> 54:58.913
Fix us a couple of drinks.

55:01.299 --> 55:03.334
What's on your mind?

55:05.303 --> 55:06.754
I want out.

55:09.056 --> 55:10.633
I want to go home.

55:14.520 --> 55:18.474
There ain't nothing waiting on you
at home except a whiskey bust.

55:18.691 --> 55:21.519
I'll worry about that when I get home.

55:21.902 --> 55:23.938
I've seen your operation.

55:25.281 --> 55:27.483
I don't like what I've seen.

55:29.076 --> 55:32.112
All right, I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll have a drink. Okay?

55:32.538 --> 55:34.698
And we'll talk about it.

55:35.249 --> 55:38.494
I always could drink your ass
under the table, anyway.

55:41.339 --> 55:43.832
That's a great accomplishment.

55:54.268 --> 55:56.512
Make those drinks strong ones.

56:09.450 --> 56:13.195
I want to ask you something,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

56:16.123 --> 56:18.033
Did you ever kill anybody?

56:18.292 --> 56:21.245
Not so as you'd notice.

56:37.978 --> 56:40.139
Have a good trip, Gator.

56:51.450 --> 56:54.695
How much do you figure you
owe the state in back taxes?

56:56.705 --> 57:00.234
Probably, if they tried real hard...

57:00.334 --> 57:02.870
they'd get me $65,000
to 70,000, earning.

57:06.841 --> 57:08.876
What if I told you...

57:09.885 --> 57:11.920
that I knew for sure...

57:12.805 --> 57:16.425
you could pay 'em back $20,000
and that'd be all you owed 'em.

57:17.017 --> 57:18.594
You could...

57:19.812 --> 57:22.097
give up all this stuff, you know.

57:24.400 --> 57:28.562
Hell, I don't want to forget this stuff.
I kind of like this stuff.

57:30.823 --> 57:32.941
Now what else is on your mind?

57:34.743 --> 57:35.944
Nothing.

57:36.412 --> 57:37.863
Good-bye.

57:49.258 --> 57:52.753
I don't know what you're
worried about $20,000 for.

57:53.220 --> 57:56.840
You can sell Bones here
for $10,000 to the circus.

58:01.187 --> 58:04.264
He has a wonderful sense
of humor, don't you, Bones?

58:07.902 --> 58:10.521
Am I talking too fast for you, Bones?

58:12.656 --> 58:14.775
They must be a lot of fun to talk to.

58:15.201 --> 58:17.061
A lot of fun.

58:17.161 --> 58:19.863
- Great conversationalists.
- They are.

58:26.337 --> 58:30.666
You sure are having a good time off
that junk old Bones put in your drink.

58:34.512 --> 58:37.131
Did you put something in my drink?

58:37.765 --> 58:39.174
Yellows.

58:39.517 --> 58:40.968
"Yellows."

58:42.019 --> 58:43.971
"Yellows."

58:46.524 --> 58:48.851
That's a good color for you.

58:49.026 --> 58:51.311
"Yellows."

58:51.987 --> 58:54.314
He's making me mad.

58:54.573 --> 58:57.067
"He's making me mad."

59:01.038 --> 59:03.073
All right, Gator, look.

59:04.792 --> 59:07.153
- You're gonna pass out in a minute.
- Pass out?

59:07.253 --> 59:09.288
Yeah, you're gonna pass out.

59:10.089 --> 59:12.666
Now, when you wake up...

59:13.801 --> 59:16.996
you're gonna be in your car,
just outside the county line.

59:17.096 --> 59:20.124
- I'm gonna pass out in a minute?
- You'll pass out in a minute.

59:20.224 --> 59:21.675
Now you wanna go home.

59:23.352 --> 59:27.014
That car's gonna be pointed.
You drive it there, hear me?

59:28.440 --> 59:30.225
'Cause I love you, boy.

59:32.736 --> 59:34.938
So don't make me hurt you.

59:37.992 --> 59:41.361
- I'm gonna pass out in a minute?
- Just about a minute.

59:43.706 --> 59:47.326
I'll just stand here for a minute,
and wait to pass out.

59:49.003 --> 59:52.498
I'll just stand here between two men...

59:52.881 --> 59:55.250
that ought to be P.O.'d at God...

59:56.051 --> 59:58.462
because when he was
handing out brains...

59:58.679 --> 01:00:01.465
he didn't give you nothing but height...

01:00:02.141 --> 01:00:03.592
and you nothing but teeth.

01:00:10.566 --> 01:00:12.760
- You'd say about a minute?
- Yeah.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:15.562
I'd say about 50 seconds have gone by.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.898
Making me...

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:20.818
Nine, eight, seven, six...

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.238
Nine, eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.

01:00:25.623 --> 01:00:27.991
One, right?

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:32.579
I only got one second?

01:00:36.759 --> 01:00:38.669
Oh, shit!

01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:43.090
I'm still here.

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:54.351
Now wait a minute.
What am I laughing about?

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:57.437
I ought to be gone by now.

01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:08.448
I was...

01:01:11.627 --> 01:01:14.288
I was way off.

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:16.790
Way off.

01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:26.300
You put him in the car like I said,
and you take him to the county line.

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:31.346
And don't you hurt him.

01:01:32.898 --> 01:01:36.260
See, what's important, Charlie,
sitting and drinking like this...

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:40.230
it's the information and the
connection and the deal, you know?

01:01:41.115 --> 01:01:44.935
You gotta know who the guy
with the brass nuts is.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:47.446
You know what I mean? That's it.

01:01:48.288 --> 01:01:50.240
Where are you from, buddy?

01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:53.827
North of here.

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:57.497
Like 1,200 miles north?

01:01:58.132 --> 01:02:00.208
Oh, no!

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:04.212
You don't look like
you're from around here.

01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:08.884
I don't get out much.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:12.346
What are you asking Charlie
all those questions for?

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:15.724
Charlie don't know a damn
thing about anything.

01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:20.687
Why don't you just talk
about getting some squish?

01:02:21.113 --> 01:02:24.942
That's exactly what
we were talking about.

01:02:31.707 --> 01:02:35.736
I think you'd be better off...
You got to lose a few, like me.

01:02:35.836 --> 01:02:37.913
Too big. And too much.

01:02:38.172 --> 01:02:40.115
Did you ever hear of the water diet?

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:42.660
I mean, water's good, and ice.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.870
Ice is very good for you, see.

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:46.672
Actually, a ton of ice.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:51.218
This is Pogie. Let me
talk to Mr. McCall.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:03.230
It's him. Okay.

01:03:05.908 --> 01:03:07.810
I mean, eight glasses.

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:11.563
It's like a kind of a crash,
you know what I mean? Like a chicken.

01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:13.740
Hello, Mr. Greenfield.

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:15.943
You don't know me.

01:03:16.043 --> 01:03:18.904
I always used to see you up
at the State Capitol Building.

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:22.408
You're with the U.S. Department
of Justice. Am I right?

01:03:22.508 --> 01:03:23.750
No!

01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:34.302
I believe you got me mixed
up with my brother Irving.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:37.931
My name is Tex. Tex Greenfield.

01:03:38.065 --> 01:03:40.426
No, I've seen you up at the hotel.

01:03:40.526 --> 01:03:44.730
I figured I'd seen you from someplace,
but I couldn't quite figure it out.

01:03:46.907 --> 01:03:50.902
I think I gotta go now.

01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:55.407
I got a couple of squishes
waiting for me over at...

01:03:55.833 --> 01:03:58.318
So I got to putting
two and two together.

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:03.198
Mr. Greenfield and the Justice Department
are down here working on something.

01:04:03.298 --> 01:04:06.043
You got something going, am I right?

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:08.628
You didn't finish your beer.

01:04:10.097 --> 01:04:13.842
You know, it's funny to see a
guy like you in a place like this.

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:18.346
Seems like you might've
come to see the law.

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:34.730
I gotta go now.

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:36.523
Okay, Charlie!

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.108
- I gotta go.
- I know. The beer.

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:40.452
I'm sorry.

01:04:46.967 --> 01:04:48.210
God!

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:57.005
I'm sorry, Mr. Greenfield.
I'm really sorry.

01:06:57.347 --> 01:07:00.792
As soon as I heard you were over here,
I came over without my breakfast.

01:07:00.892 --> 01:07:02.502
- Wonderful.
- How is he, Doc?

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:04.671
Contusion and hematoma
of the left testicle.

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:09.343
Left inguinal hernia, cervical neck strain
and sprain, fractures of the ribs, clavicle...

01:07:09.443 --> 01:07:10.928
Out, Doc.

01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:12.729
Thank you, Doc.

01:07:18.285 --> 01:07:20.820
Dr. James Nicholson, reception.

01:07:28.295 --> 01:07:30.447
We don't want those
federal people thinking...

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:33.333
that we didn't do right
for one of their fellows.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:35.535
I'm sorry.

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:37.371
You wouldn't.

01:07:37.471 --> 01:07:39.464
There were two of them.

01:07:39.598 --> 01:07:42.300
One was big.

01:07:44.311 --> 01:07:45.295
Biggie!

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:49.891
We're gonna get a full description just
as soon as you start feeling better.

01:07:51.193 --> 01:07:53.261
- Mr. McKlusky, Eyewitness News here.
- Holy Christ!

01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:56.390
Is it true Mr. Greenfield is an
undercover government agent?

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:58.642
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:07:58.742 --> 01:08:01.853
The police said he was
arrested while being drunk...

01:08:01.953 --> 01:08:05.365
and they didn't know what his
assignment is. Could you tell us?

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:08.285
- Miss Maybank?
- Maybank.

01:08:08.502 --> 01:08:13.573
The only thing I know is that Mr. Greenfield,
what he does for a living...

01:08:13.673 --> 01:08:18.211
He works for a ladies' hygiene spray.
I believe it's called "Sprunt."

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:22.090
Very clever.

01:08:22.808 --> 01:08:24.792
Is there anything I can do for you?

01:08:24.893 --> 01:08:26.845
No. Oh, yeah.

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:31.265
You can get me a private phone...

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:37.221
or does Bama McCall have
Southern Bell locked up, too?

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:39.816
No, we gonna get you your phone.

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:42.319
Sorry about hitting that hand.

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:47.524
- The police beat him up, didn't they?
- Want a MoonPie?

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:49.242
No, thank you.

01:08:49.835 --> 01:08:52.696
- It was the police, wasn't it?
- How the hell do I know?

01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:55.448
- You're a lot smarter than you look.
- Thank you.

01:08:55.549 --> 01:08:57.283
- Welcome.
- Want some coffee?

01:08:57.384 --> 01:08:59.294
No, thank you.

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:03.457
- Are you following me?
- I am.

01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:04.841
Good.

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:09.004
- What is Greenfield?
- Oh, shit...

01:09:09.104 --> 01:09:11.598
Department of Justice or State Police?

01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:14.176
Take a left.

01:09:14.276 --> 01:09:16.803
- Take a left? That's very funny.
- You think so?

01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:19.096
- I think it is.
- You're a schmuck.

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:21.475
- Did you learn that at Vassar?
- Radcliffe.

01:09:21.575 --> 01:09:23.268
- I want to see Greenfield.
- You do?

01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:25.944
- I do. I think you can arrange it.
- I think I will.

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:28.732
I remember when I was
a kid in Brooklyn...

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:32.819
there were guys like Thurman Arnold
and Fiorello LaGuardia around.

01:09:32.919 --> 01:09:35.830
- What do you think they'd do now?
- Fiorello who?

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:39.117
LaGuardia, you putz!

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:41.961
He cleaned up New York 35 years ago.

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:43.671
It got dirty again.

01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:47.084
I know this woman. Emmeline Cavanaugh.

01:09:47.184 --> 01:09:50.879
She showed me all the phony tax
records of McCall and Caffrey.

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:53.506
- Come on, you're kidding.
- I'm not.

01:09:53.607 --> 01:09:56.309
Listen, if she can
get anything, I mean...

01:09:56.443 --> 01:10:00.764
anything in phony tax accounting,
there's a reward in it for her.

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:03.517
- Are you sure she had access to records?
- Yes.

01:10:03.617 --> 01:10:05.268
- Oh, my God!
- That's right.

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:09.322
She worked at City Hall for 22 years,
and Caffrey just fired her.

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:11.191
That's it.

01:10:11.291 --> 01:10:13.610
Go back to your brat kid
and your moonshine.

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:15.028
- Get out of my hair!
- Wait.

01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:19.616
- Am I off the hook? Can I go home now?
- I'm telling you to get out of my life!

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:22.460
Mr. Greenfield,
we're gonna have to sedate you.

01:10:22.761 --> 01:10:24.629
Sedate me, my ass!

01:10:25.013 --> 01:10:26.456
What did you say?

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:28.842
I said, "Sedate me, my ass!"

01:10:29.226 --> 01:10:30.510
Fine!

01:10:34.314 --> 01:10:37.050
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna find a massage parlor.

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:40.720
- Don't you want to talk to Miss Cavanaugh?
- Does she give massages?

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:44.141
Look, I don't understand.
Are you working with Greenfield or not?

01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:47.394
I'm just trying not to get killed,
to stay out of the slammer.

01:10:47.494 --> 01:10:50.447
- Can you understand that?
- What are you talking about?

01:10:51.206 --> 01:10:54.242
- You rang?
- Can I buy you a drink?

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:59.739
Is a pig's ass pork?
'Course you can buy me a drink.

01:10:59.839 --> 01:11:02.041
Women's lib, I love it.

01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:05.203
Just because you buy me a drink,
doesn't mean you own me.

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:07.581
I know how you are,
you turn into an octopus.

01:11:07.681 --> 01:11:10.383
You women are all alike.
You're all animals.

01:11:13.353 --> 01:11:14.629
My car.

01:11:14.729 --> 01:11:16.055
Very conservative.

01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:32.071
I'm gonna blow your frigging head off.

01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:37.118
Don't do this.

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:53.009
My feet are killing me.

01:11:57.731 --> 01:12:00.767
- Let me go!
- You want out? You want loose?

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:02.560
There!

01:12:08.408 --> 01:12:11.853
I knew I could count on you.

01:12:11.953 --> 01:12:15.698
I've always been your friend, Smiley.
You know that.

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:20.620
I'm gonna take care of you.
You're gonna be all right.

01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:36.761
Hi, guy!

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:57.399
Listen...

01:12:57.499 --> 01:13:02.036
I think you'll like her. But some
people think she's a little strange.

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.330
I can handle strange.

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:06.708
Right.

01:13:10.804 --> 01:13:14.124
Do you love my cats? I love my cats.

01:13:14.224 --> 01:13:16.092
I love all living things...

01:13:16.643 --> 01:13:18.344
except flies.

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:20.380
Caffrey...

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.590
is a bad person.

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:26.269
- Would you tell us about the flies? Files?
- I have two cats.

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:30.348
There are two sets of accounts
in Caffrey's personal files.

01:13:30.448 --> 01:13:32.225
One he pays taxes on...

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:34.193
one he does not.

01:13:34.494 --> 01:13:37.447
What outside companies
is he involved in?

01:13:37.831 --> 01:13:39.149
Apex Finance...

01:13:39.249 --> 01:13:42.110
Dixie Entertainment,
all those gas stations...

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:45.196
all of them owned by
Caffrey and McCall...

01:13:45.296 --> 01:13:48.124
and all of them exploiting the masses.

01:13:53.096 --> 01:13:54.839
He loves music.

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:58.793
Didn't you see how he loved that?

01:13:58.893 --> 01:14:01.095
Yeah, he's going crazy.

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:05.842
Could we talk about the records?

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:08.227
You may have those records.

01:14:09.028 --> 01:14:10.647
How is that possible?

01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:12.766
You may go with me into the courthouse...

01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:15.860
and we will make copies
of all the records.

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:19.606
- Won't that be a little dangerous?
- It'll be thrilling!

01:14:19.706 --> 01:14:22.192
But you don't work at
the courthouse anymore.

01:14:22.292 --> 01:14:23.868
I don't?

01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:26.279
Of course, I don't.

01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:28.581
But I detest dishonesty.

01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:30.200
So...

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:31.918
I stole the keys.

01:14:38.057 --> 01:14:39.084
You see.

01:14:39.184 --> 01:14:42.553
- This is it, right here.
- Not now. Wait a minute!

01:15:00.455 --> 01:15:01.906
Come on.

01:15:02.457 --> 01:15:04.609
Wait. I want to take my babies.

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:06.953
We're not taking the cats!

01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:13.209
Then I'm not going.

01:15:14.302 --> 01:15:15.753
God!

01:15:17.764 --> 01:15:20.633
- Take the cats?
- We're taking the cats.

01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:24.045
All right. Now, you take Silver Bell.
There we go.

01:15:24.145 --> 01:15:25.255
You take Red.

01:15:25.355 --> 01:15:27.257
- Red.
- I've got the keys.

01:15:27.357 --> 01:15:28.725
Right.

01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:36.816
I can't believe I'm doing this!

01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:55.001
You have the strongest hands.

01:15:58.096 --> 01:16:00.381
It's just like a spy movie.

01:16:03.184 --> 01:16:05.595
She belongs in a rubber room.

01:16:23.871 --> 01:16:26.524
You didn't tell me about
the night watchman.

01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:28.826
But he's such a nice man.

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:33.206
She's crazy.

01:16:50.565 --> 01:16:52.967
- Is this the room, Emmeline?
- No.

01:16:53.067 --> 01:16:55.261
This is where all the new books are.

01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:58.306
Red is scratching the hell out of me.

01:16:58.406 --> 01:17:00.066
He loves you.

01:17:00.617 --> 01:17:03.736
We'll go in here.
The Caffrey books are in here.

01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:05.688
I'm gonna show you some accounts...

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:08.024
that would knock you out.

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:10.026
This is the Xerox room.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:13.321
Now, put Red and Silver
down right there...

01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:15.164
and I'll get the light.

01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:19.126
- Keys.
- Keys, yes.

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:23.130
Is this it?

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.293
Now, these are very heavy...

01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:28.962
so don't hurt yourself.

01:17:29.062 --> 01:17:30.346
There. Here.

01:17:33.566 --> 01:17:35.601
Put it on the counter.

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:37.929
Now you stay there,
you little sweethearts.

01:17:38.029 --> 01:17:40.473
Now, you see right here.
"C" for Caffrey.

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:43.101
"L" between "R" is "M" for McCall.

01:17:43.201 --> 01:17:45.278
- That makes sense.
- Everything's here.

01:17:45.787 --> 01:17:49.232
- Where's "McCall"?
- McCall, right here, "Mc."

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:52.368
Here. There. Everything's there.

01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:55.955
This is terrific. This is wonderful.

01:17:56.923 --> 01:17:57.907
Babies!

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:00.118
We can't carry these
big books outta here.

01:18:00.218 --> 01:18:03.538
- But we've got the Xerox machine.
- Right, the Xerox machine.

01:18:03.638 --> 01:18:04.831
I got it.

01:18:04.931 --> 01:18:06.799
I'll take this one.

01:18:06.974 --> 01:18:09.051
Let's get out of here!

01:18:09.227 --> 01:18:11.387
My babies!

01:18:12.647 --> 01:18:14.265
Where is he?

01:19:03.614 --> 01:19:05.566
Stop, or I'll shoot!

01:19:47.033 --> 01:19:50.111
Left your keys in the car again,
didn't you, Red?

01:19:50.244 --> 01:19:51.696
Shut up!

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:20.933
- Hello.
- Greeny, this is Gator.

01:20:23.236 --> 01:20:24.770
We got him.

01:20:24.904 --> 01:20:28.733
We got the whole shooting match.
Caffrey's records, McCall's, everything.

01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:30.943
Really?

01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:33.612
I'll see you in the morning.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:36.566
Forget tomorrow morning, you schmuck.

01:20:36.666 --> 01:20:38.651
What time is it? Where are you now?

01:20:38.751 --> 01:20:39.944
I'm nearby, why?

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:43.448
I'm getting dressed.
Meet me at Emergency in five minutes.

01:20:43.548 --> 01:20:45.708
What the hell are you talking about?

01:20:45.842 --> 01:20:47.251
Greeny?

01:21:28.634 --> 01:21:30.461
Two Jews in pain.

01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:33.005
Let my people go, already.

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:48.554
Mabel, I think you're being
oversensitive about it all.

01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:50.389
He wasn't that way when I dated him...

01:21:50.489 --> 01:21:52.600
or when Carol Ann dated him.

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:56.195
Carol Ann did date him, dear.
You didn't know that?

01:21:57.204 --> 01:21:58.989
Of course!

01:21:59.916 --> 01:22:03.702
No, I mean, if you didn't
know that about him...

01:22:04.712 --> 01:22:07.164
I don't know what to tell you.

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:10.243
Good night, Nurse.
See you in the morning.

01:22:10.343 --> 01:22:12.294
Good night, Doctor.

01:23:04.397 --> 01:23:06.473
Get in the car, fatty!

01:23:15.825 --> 01:23:17.894
Get in the car!

01:23:17.994 --> 01:23:19.437
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

01:23:19.537 --> 01:23:22.656
- My name's Irving Greenfield.
- How do you do?

01:23:26.293 --> 01:23:29.205
We've got to ditch this car. It's hot.

01:23:29.964 --> 01:23:31.824
Then we've got to find a hideout...

01:23:31.924 --> 01:23:35.169
and then we've got to get
another getaway car!

01:23:36.971 --> 01:23:40.799
Okay, we'll go to my house,
we'll change cars...

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:44.712
then we'll go to my uncle's beach place.
We can stay there.

01:23:44.812 --> 01:23:46.047
There's nobody out there now...

01:23:46.147 --> 01:23:49.558
Wait a minute. Who said that you
could make all the decisions?

01:23:50.735 --> 01:23:53.145
I should be making the decisions.

01:23:53.487 --> 01:23:56.390
That was a good decision
that you made there.

01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:58.726
- Wasn't that a good one that she made?
- Thank you.

01:23:58.826 --> 01:24:00.819
- You're right.
- Right.

01:24:14.633 --> 01:24:17.253
All right, Billy Joe, what is it?

01:24:17.595 --> 01:24:21.298
Somebody broke in the old file room,
and they got Caffrey's records.

01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:25.962
And?

01:24:26.062 --> 01:24:28.681
And they got your records. Everybody's.

01:24:31.442 --> 01:24:33.018
Oh, my God!

01:24:38.074 --> 01:24:40.601
We've got the roads blocked.
The airport. Everything.

01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:42.736
They'll never get out of town.

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:54.331
I've been nice to him long enough.

01:25:01.388 --> 01:25:03.215
Now I'm gonna kill him.

01:25:20.658 --> 01:25:24.236
Have you got '71 there?
'68 and '72 are all mixed up.

01:25:24.495 --> 01:25:25.738
Yes.

01:25:26.413 --> 01:25:28.232
Not on the pages!

01:25:28.332 --> 01:25:32.411
- It's a Class 1 indictment.
- I wish you wouldn't yell at me.

01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:35.789
You better get to a phone
and call my office.

01:25:36.382 --> 01:25:39.168
Where the hell am I gonna find
a phone at 5:00 in the morning?

01:25:42.096 --> 01:25:44.840
I think we can use a little
more firewood, don't you?

01:25:45.266 --> 01:25:46.633
Right.

01:25:47.268 --> 01:25:50.179
Probably some driftwood
out on the beach.

01:25:51.105 --> 01:25:52.598
Probably.

01:25:53.190 --> 01:25:55.092
Want to give me a hand?

01:25:55.192 --> 01:25:57.061
I'll give you two.

01:26:01.907 --> 01:26:04.902
They're going out on the beach
to get some driftwood...

01:26:05.077 --> 01:26:06.779
for the fire.

01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:11.367
Race you!

01:26:31.812 --> 01:26:34.848
I bet they're gonna
walk in the moonlight.

01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:39.436
Good luck to them. If there's moonlight,
they'll walk in it. Right?

01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:42.389
You're a very masculine man.

01:26:42.489 --> 01:26:45.401
Lady, will you give me a break, please?

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.655
- I'll bet you think I've never been married.
- I don't care.

01:26:50.915 --> 01:26:54.235
I've never been married.
In fact, I've never even been...

01:26:54.335 --> 01:26:55.661
Lady!

01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:06.296
I'm strangely attracted to you.

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:11.552
Oh, my...

01:27:12.519 --> 01:27:13.804
God!

01:27:37.711 --> 01:27:40.372
- Feet warm?
- Yes, very toasty.

01:27:45.511 --> 01:27:46.871
Know what?

01:27:46.971 --> 01:27:48.255
What?

01:27:48.514 --> 01:27:51.049
I don't know anything about you.

01:27:53.269 --> 01:27:56.180
I don't know anything about me, either.

01:27:56.397 --> 01:27:57.882
I don't believe that.

01:27:57.982 --> 01:28:00.767
I think you know exactly who you are.

01:28:08.742 --> 01:28:11.945
I think I was born about
100 years too late.

01:28:12.705 --> 01:28:15.107
I should have been around...

01:28:15.207 --> 01:28:17.776
when not having any style was in style.

01:28:17.876 --> 01:28:19.995
You're crazy, McKlusky.

01:28:20.129 --> 01:28:21.906
You've got style.

01:28:22.006 --> 01:28:24.082
You got a lot of style.

01:28:24.383 --> 01:28:25.751
Really?

01:28:29.805 --> 01:28:32.333
I styled myself right into prison.

01:28:32.433 --> 01:28:33.967
Two times.

01:28:35.394 --> 01:28:36.970
Four years.

01:28:38.731 --> 01:28:40.424
I do one thing good, though.

01:28:40.524 --> 01:28:42.100
What's that?

01:28:42.318 --> 01:28:44.178
Make pretty babies.

01:28:44.278 --> 01:28:46.104
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:28:46.572 --> 01:28:48.273
I can prove it.

01:28:48.407 --> 01:28:49.725
Who asked you to?

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:52.819
I'm talking about my
9-year-old daughter.

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:56.615
She's about 9 years old, going on 35.

01:28:57.416 --> 01:28:59.368
Where's her mother?

01:29:00.753 --> 01:29:02.454
I don't know.

01:29:04.548 --> 01:29:08.043
After a couple of years,
she got tired of waiting...

01:29:09.511 --> 01:29:11.129
and cutout.

01:29:15.225 --> 01:29:17.461
You gonna have some kids sometime?

01:29:17.561 --> 01:29:18.804
No.

01:29:22.608 --> 01:29:24.935
Ever been to New York City?

01:29:25.611 --> 01:29:26.929
- What?
- New York.

01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:28.480
Have you ever been to New York?

01:29:31.116 --> 01:29:32.226
No.

01:29:32.326 --> 01:29:35.487
I hear the only gators they got
up there are in the sewer.

01:29:36.372 --> 01:29:37.864
Yes, sir.

01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:39.692
Hell, that bugs me.

01:29:39.792 --> 01:29:42.111
People come down here
and buy baby alligators.

01:29:42.211 --> 01:29:44.655
They go back, and when they
get bored with them...

01:29:44.755 --> 01:29:47.291
they flush them down the toilet.

01:29:47.466 --> 01:29:50.536
You know what they live on in there?
In the sewers?

01:29:50.636 --> 01:29:52.871
Live on giant balls of Tubifex worms.

01:29:52.971 --> 01:29:57.042
They're about 12 feet across,
and they go rolling down the sewers.

01:29:57.142 --> 01:30:00.178
And they live on that, and sewer rats.

01:30:00.521 --> 01:30:03.140
They say they get to be 10 feet.

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:11.807
Do you know what they want
me to do at the station?

01:30:11.907 --> 01:30:15.068
They want me to fill this in.
Do you think this looks better?

01:30:17.287 --> 01:30:18.939
You mean, the gap filled?

01:30:19.039 --> 01:30:20.699
Fill the gap.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.328
Come on. What do you think?

01:30:24.711 --> 01:30:26.405
Do you want me to be honest?

01:30:26.505 --> 01:30:27.748
Yes.

01:30:29.049 --> 01:30:31.368
I think you look a lot better that way.

01:30:31.468 --> 01:30:33.545
Male chauvinist porker!

01:30:38.725 --> 01:30:40.802
Sure is dark out here.

01:30:45.274 --> 01:30:47.059
Quite exciting.

01:30:50.028 --> 01:30:52.064
Do you like the ocean?

01:30:53.198 --> 01:30:56.068
- I love the ocean.
- Me, too.

01:30:56.952 --> 01:30:58.695
It's beautiful.

01:31:01.748 --> 01:31:03.492
Sometimes...

01:31:04.126 --> 01:31:07.120
I hate to look at it
all at once, though.

01:31:08.839 --> 01:31:11.958
I have to look at it a
little bit at a time.

01:31:13.385 --> 01:31:16.421
I'm afraid if I look at it all
at once, it'll disappear.

01:31:20.976 --> 01:31:23.762
That's the way I have to look at you.

01:31:24.730 --> 01:31:26.598
A little bit at a time.

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:33.271
I'm afraid if I look at you all
at once, you'll disappear.

01:31:43.624 --> 01:31:44.950
Okay.

01:31:55.928 --> 01:31:57.496
You charmed the shirt...

01:31:57.596 --> 01:31:59.464
right off my back.

01:32:02.935 --> 01:32:04.428
Now what?

01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:07.597
Take off Uncle Hunsy's hat.

01:32:09.650 --> 01:32:11.226
You got it.

01:33:59.217 --> 01:34:01.294
I don't want to get up.

01:34:03.013 --> 01:34:04.589
You gotta get up.

01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.136
What do you want to do?

01:34:14.358 --> 01:34:16.802
I want to win a Pulitzer Prize...

01:34:16.902 --> 01:34:21.106
and make love to you on the
terrace of a New York apartment.

01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:23.108
A penthouse, in fact.

01:34:27.913 --> 01:34:31.241
Settle for an old Rotary
Club football trophy...

01:34:31.833 --> 01:34:34.035
and a hump in the swamp?

01:34:34.795 --> 01:34:36.538
I wouldn't.

01:34:38.507 --> 01:34:40.709
I didn't think you would.

01:34:41.259 --> 01:34:43.211
You're right.

01:34:45.055 --> 01:34:47.591
I'll race you back to the house.

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:50.635
Come on.

01:34:51.395 --> 01:34:52.379
Rainbow Club...

01:34:52.479 --> 01:34:55.307
$5,473.

01:34:55.732 --> 01:34:58.176
- Joe's Market...
- Good morning.

01:34:58.276 --> 01:35:01.346
Damn it, McKlusky, you better get
on the phone to Joe Bridger.

01:35:01.446 --> 01:35:03.265
It'll take him two hours to get here.

01:35:03.365 --> 01:35:05.726
- How will I find a phone?
- I know where there's one.

01:35:05.826 --> 01:35:07.477
She knows where there's a phone.

01:35:07.577 --> 01:35:10.689
Wait, we need some groceries.
I made out a list.

01:35:10.789 --> 01:35:13.692
Lots of cat food and some sandwiches.
You all behave now.

01:35:13.792 --> 01:35:15.118
You all behave.

01:35:15.502 --> 01:35:16.703
Seven...

01:35:17.713 --> 01:35:19.164
eight...

01:35:20.173 --> 01:35:21.499
six...

01:35:24.845 --> 01:35:26.296
eight...

01:35:27.305 --> 01:35:28.632
nine.

01:35:34.146 --> 01:35:36.423
Hi, Billy Raybolt.
We found your lost dog.

01:35:36.523 --> 01:35:39.142
How much is the reward this time?

01:35:39.818 --> 01:35:43.639
Excuse me, I gotta make an important call.
You guys want to step out a minute?

01:35:43.739 --> 01:35:46.725
- Just step out a second.
- Tell him we found his lost dog.

01:35:46.825 --> 01:35:48.777
He don't believe me.

01:35:53.081 --> 01:35:55.867
- Who am I talking to?
- Billy Raybolt.

01:35:59.045 --> 01:36:00.497
Billy...

01:36:00.672 --> 01:36:02.290
they got...

01:36:02.758 --> 01:36:04.417
Billy, they got your dog.

01:36:06.052 --> 01:36:09.047
It don't matter who I am.
We got your dog.

01:36:10.015 --> 01:36:12.459
How do I know?
'Cause I'm stepping all over him.

01:36:12.559 --> 01:36:14.419
Now come get your damn dog!

01:36:14.519 --> 01:36:15.804
Here.

01:36:18.148 --> 01:36:20.058
Hi. This is Jimmy.

01:36:20.859 --> 01:36:23.019
He said he ain't coming.

01:36:23.195 --> 01:36:24.221
Why?

01:36:24.321 --> 01:36:28.400
'Cause you cursed at him. He ain't
coming till you tell him you're sorry.

01:36:29.034 --> 01:36:30.527
Look...

01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:35.281
Hello, Billy?

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:43.915
Sorry.

01:36:45.008 --> 01:36:46.292
What?

01:36:50.388 --> 01:36:52.833
I cross my heart and hope to die.

01:36:52.933 --> 01:36:56.052
Stick my... Shove...
Stick my finger in the sky.

01:36:56.561 --> 01:36:59.264
Point my finger in the sky.

01:37:02.567 --> 01:37:05.437
Okay, now come get your frigging dog.

01:37:05.612 --> 01:37:07.147
Okay, out.

01:37:16.998 --> 01:37:19.617
I want to make a collect
call to Mr. Jack Bridger.

01:37:26.258 --> 01:37:29.828
That news lady's uncle owns a beach
house at 53 Outer Island Lane.

01:37:29.928 --> 01:37:31.788
It's out past the boatyard.

01:37:31.888 --> 01:37:33.248
All right.

01:37:33.348 --> 01:37:35.800
But you keep your guys in,
and let me handle it. Okay?

01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:45.969
We don't have time for
you to get back to me.

01:37:46.069 --> 01:37:47.937
Get somebody down here.

01:37:48.113 --> 01:37:50.273
53 Outer Island Lane...

01:37:50.490 --> 01:37:52.192
Dunston Beach.

01:37:53.451 --> 01:37:54.819
Right.

01:38:01.042 --> 01:38:04.370
- How much was the reward for the dog?
- $1.

01:38:11.887 --> 01:38:13.338
Apiece.

01:38:15.432 --> 01:38:18.051
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

01:38:37.078 --> 01:38:41.107
I'm gonna change Red's name to
Mr. Greenfield, 'cause he's so sweet.

01:38:41.207 --> 01:38:43.409
Gee, that's terrific.

01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:05.723
Go for it.

01:39:08.693 --> 01:39:10.520
Try it, partner.

01:39:10.695 --> 01:39:12.564
You can reach it.

01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:18.194
You're thinking about it, ain't you?

01:39:19.204 --> 01:39:20.947
Go ahead.

01:39:21.665 --> 01:39:23.116
You might even make it.

01:39:35.929 --> 01:39:38.339
Get her the hell out of here.

01:40:12.090 --> 01:40:15.043
Let me go! My babies!

01:40:16.886 --> 01:40:18.963
Bring her and come on.

01:40:20.515 --> 01:40:22.884
- Right in the balls!
- Damn it!

01:40:31.568 --> 01:40:33.728
Move, now!

01:41:20.492 --> 01:41:23.027
Aggie, we gotta get outta here.

01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:34.038
We gotta get outta here, now.

01:42:05.578 --> 01:42:06.904
Stay.

01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:16.581
Afternoon.

01:42:16.756 --> 01:42:18.116
Afternoon, sir.

01:42:18.216 --> 01:42:20.285
You got any empty rooms?

01:42:20.385 --> 01:42:24.589
This time of season we got a lot
of empty rooms. Take your pick.

01:42:25.890 --> 01:42:29.210
- How about that one way down on the end?
- Down there?

01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:32.138
You don't have to go that far.
I ain't gonna bother you none.

01:42:33.064 --> 01:42:35.175
I just got married.

01:42:35.275 --> 01:42:38.303
Newlyweds, you know,
we'd like a little privacy.

01:42:38.403 --> 01:42:39.937
Newlywed, huh?

01:42:41.281 --> 01:42:43.099
Just got married?

01:42:43.199 --> 01:42:45.068
Gonna make some noise tonight?

01:42:45.577 --> 01:42:47.028
Maybe a little.

01:42:47.579 --> 01:42:48.988
Okay.

01:42:49.622 --> 01:42:51.983
Why don't we fill this
card out, let's see...

01:42:52.083 --> 01:42:55.487
how'd you like "Mr. Smith," "Mr. Jones"?

01:42:55.587 --> 01:42:58.122
Gator McKlusky.

01:42:58.715 --> 01:43:00.416
Greenfield's dead.

01:43:01.467 --> 01:43:03.795
I'm positive he's dead.

01:43:04.971 --> 01:43:08.132
And there'll be some more people dead
if you don't get down here soon.

01:43:08.766 --> 01:43:12.970
You understand what I'm telling you?
It's "come and get us" time.

01:43:15.523 --> 01:43:16.891
Right.

01:43:17.275 --> 01:43:21.104
I'm at the Ocean Plaza Motel,
Dunston Beach.

01:43:22.447 --> 01:43:24.982
Get some people down here. Now!

01:43:32.457 --> 01:43:35.827
Operator, get me the Dunston
Police Department, please.

01:43:36.044 --> 01:43:37.954
Dunston Police Department.

01:43:38.213 --> 01:43:41.741
I want to talk to Bama McCall.
Just tell him Gator's calling.

01:43:41.841 --> 01:43:45.169
Mr. McCall is not with
the Police Department.

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:47.713
I know that, darling.

01:43:47.889 --> 01:43:49.916
But he's got a phone in his big red car.

01:43:50.016 --> 01:43:51.918
Just get him on the goddamn phone!

01:43:52.018 --> 01:43:55.505
We have someone on the line that
wants to talk to you, Mr. McCall.

01:43:55.605 --> 01:43:57.348
He insists he knows you.

01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:59.175
Who is it?

01:43:59.275 --> 01:44:01.060
He just said Gator.

01:44:03.696 --> 01:44:05.857
Put the boy on, honey.

01:44:07.242 --> 01:44:09.360
- Gator?
- It's me.

01:44:09.577 --> 01:44:11.446
Where you at, boy?

01:44:11.663 --> 01:44:13.448
You'll find out.

01:44:13.706 --> 01:44:16.742
I want $2,000 and a
plane ticket back home.

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:19.912
I thought you had already gone home.

01:44:20.338 --> 01:44:22.707
And what do you want $2,000 for?

01:44:23.341 --> 01:44:25.334
I got something you want.

01:44:26.261 --> 01:44:29.213
Some papers.
Accounting papers, stuff like that.

01:44:31.808 --> 01:44:34.927
I heard all them papers done burned up.

01:44:35.353 --> 01:44:36.637
Not all of them.

01:44:38.815 --> 01:44:40.550
All right, you got a deal.

01:44:40.650 --> 01:44:43.102
Just tell me where I gotta bring them.

01:44:43.987 --> 01:44:46.230
$2,000 and a plane ticket back home.

01:44:46.406 --> 01:44:49.942
Right, $2,000 and a plane ticket.
All I gotta know is where you're at.

01:44:51.369 --> 01:44:55.072
You ain't gonna bring that nasty
old gun with you, are you?

01:44:55.331 --> 01:44:58.409
I ain't gonna bring that gun.

01:44:59.002 --> 01:45:01.078
The Ocean Plaza Motel.

01:45:01.879 --> 01:45:03.122
Dunston Beach.

01:45:04.382 --> 01:45:06.417
Turn this son of a bitch around.

01:45:31.159 --> 01:45:32.860
You all right?

01:45:33.244 --> 01:45:34.570
Yeah.

01:45:34.871 --> 01:45:36.697
I need your help.

01:45:37.290 --> 01:45:38.866
You got it.

01:45:40.084 --> 01:45:42.403
I want you to take those pillows...

01:45:42.503 --> 01:45:45.490
and make a couple of lumps
under the bed sheet.

01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:46.991
Like you and me?

01:45:47.091 --> 01:45:49.126
- Right.
- Okay.

01:46:40.853 --> 01:46:42.388
Pull the drapes.

01:46:57.537 --> 01:46:59.530
Let's get outta here.

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:05.244
Easy.

01:47:46.043 --> 01:47:48.579
I'm going to let you have this one.

01:48:18.576 --> 01:48:20.111
Holy shit!

01:48:41.098 --> 01:48:43.426
Get out. Move, dummy!

01:51:25.346 --> 01:51:26.589
Hi.

01:51:28.766 --> 01:51:30.301
Come here.

01:51:40.027 --> 01:51:41.512
- I saw you last night.
- You did?

01:51:41.612 --> 01:51:43.314
- Yes.
- Did you really?

01:51:43.572 --> 01:51:46.358
National! I went national.

01:51:46.909 --> 01:51:48.978
Did you hear how Cronkite introduced me?

01:51:49.078 --> 01:51:51.022
I don't remember the exact words.

01:51:51.122 --> 01:51:52.823
Why not? I do.

01:51:53.165 --> 01:51:57.620
"In Dunston County,
Aggie Weedow Maybank has the story."

01:51:57.962 --> 01:52:01.198
That's the first time in my whole
life anybody ever said it right.

01:52:01.298 --> 01:52:04.327
- I can understand that.
- And I'm sitting in the room...

01:52:04.427 --> 01:52:06.662
my hands are dripping sweat,
I was so nervous.

01:52:06.762 --> 01:52:08.706
They were sitting around.
I kept thinking:

01:52:08.806 --> 01:52:10.833
"What if the tape breaks?
We're on national TV."

01:52:10.933 --> 01:52:12.968
You looked wonderful.

01:52:14.311 --> 01:52:16.305
I'm so happy.

01:52:20.651 --> 01:52:22.845
I didn't even tell you the best part.

01:52:22.945 --> 01:52:26.523
They called me from New York,
and they want me to...

01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:31.528
Go on, they want you to
go to New York, and what?

01:52:33.789 --> 01:52:37.401
CBS called, and they want me
to bring some tapes over...

01:52:37.501 --> 01:52:41.038
and do some interviews.
Probably nothing will happen.

01:52:45.634 --> 01:52:47.336
It Will.

01:52:48.304 --> 01:52:50.589
'Cause you want it so much.

01:52:51.348 --> 01:52:53.926
I want it more than
anything in the world.

01:52:56.187 --> 01:52:57.554
I know.

01:53:00.566 --> 01:53:03.094
I wanted you to meet my daughter.

01:53:03.194 --> 01:53:05.562
I'd love to meet her someday.

01:53:13.037 --> 01:53:14.613
I love you.

01:53:16.373 --> 01:53:17.741
I know.

01:53:25.174 --> 01:53:26.625
New York?

01:53:35.309 --> 01:53:37.128
I learned a lot from you.

01:53:37.228 --> 01:53:39.638
I learned a lot from you, too.

01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:50.482
I'll see you.
