Betty, come on.
You'll miss the cake.

00:12.788 --> 00:16.088
Eh, it has nuts.
I can't eat nuts.

00:16.123 --> 00:19.190
If I'm being honest,
you are way too serious.

00:19.226 --> 00:21.527
Come on.
Have some fun.

01:10.378 --> 01:11.514
Okay...

01:22.324 --> 01:23.823
- Clear the way!
- Emergency!

01:23.859 --> 01:25.591
Please, clear
the hallway.

01:34.735 --> 01:36.335
Meg, Reade tells me

01:36.371 --> 01:38.407
that you are up for
a big story at the paper.

01:40.175 --> 01:42.140
Uh, well...

01:42.176 --> 01:43.274
He wasn't supposed to.

01:43.310 --> 01:44.844
In Tuscany, right?
For how long?

01:44.880 --> 01:47.312
A month, but I can't go.

01:47.348 --> 01:48.514
What?

01:48.550 --> 01:50.883
It is an all-expenses-paid trip
to one of the most beautiful

01:50.919 --> 01:52.851
places on Earth,
of course you can go.

01:52.887 --> 01:55.321
Reade, you should take a couple
of days off and go with her.

01:55.357 --> 01:56.422
She's got a lot on her plate,
and I can't...

01:56.458 --> 01:58.289
She's got a lot
on her plate?

01:58.325 --> 02:01.460
It is a huge opportunity.
What could she possibly...

02:01.496 --> 02:02.664
Zapata, drop it.

02:03.732 --> 02:04.667
Oh.

02:05.901 --> 02:08.167
I can't go because
if I leave the country...

02:08.203 --> 02:10.239
Meg...

02:11.840 --> 02:13.309
I can't come back.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.709
I'm in the U.S. illegally.

02:17.745 --> 02:19.477
I'm undocumented.

02:32.761 --> 02:34.793
Morning.
You're up early.

02:34.829 --> 02:36.628
I couldn't sleep.

02:36.664 --> 02:38.531
Why? What's up?

02:38.567 --> 02:40.799
For so long I didn't know
Avery existed.

02:40.835 --> 02:41.934
And then when
I found out she did,

02:41.970 --> 02:43.269
I didn't know
where she was...

02:43.305 --> 02:45.203
or if she was even alive.

02:45.239 --> 02:46.638
And now that she's here
in New York,

02:46.674 --> 02:49.174
she still feels
a million miles away.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.342
It's not gonna
be that way forever.

02:51.378 --> 02:55.314
I know she doesn't
owe me anything, but...

02:55.350 --> 02:56.484
I wanna know her.

02:59.821 --> 03:02.223
She'll come around.

03:07.795 --> 03:08.928
Kurt.

03:08.964 --> 03:10.930
Nas. Come in.

03:10.966 --> 03:12.301
Thanks.

03:13.734 --> 03:15.303
Jane...

03:16.704 --> 03:17.705
Long time, huh?

03:19.341 --> 03:20.673
What are you
doing here?

03:20.709 --> 03:22.975
I need your help.

03:23.011 --> 03:25.543
It's about
one of the tattoos.

03:28.483 --> 03:31.382
My family came from India
when I was six.

03:31.418 --> 03:34.252
My uncle arranged our papers,

03:34.288 --> 03:35.853
and we thought
everything was okay.

03:35.889 --> 03:37.622
Then, when I was 16,

03:37.658 --> 03:39.490
I took my documents
to the DMV

03:39.526 --> 03:41.393
to get my driver's license...

03:41.429 --> 03:43.394
the lady at the counter
took one look at them

03:43.430 --> 03:45.997
and said that if I
didn't want to get arrested

03:46.033 --> 03:47.733
I should burn the whole pile.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.268
Your uncle got you fakes.

03:49.304 --> 03:50.301
I've gone to college.

03:50.337 --> 03:52.404
I've paid taxes.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.939
I've worked at two
high-profile newspapers

03:53.975 --> 03:55.573
without being discovered.

03:55.609 --> 03:58.943
But everything that I do,
it's a roll of the dice.

03:58.979 --> 04:00.645
That's a horrible way to live.

04:00.681 --> 04:01.981
But not as bad
as the idea

04:02.017 --> 04:03.482
of being shipped off
to a place

04:03.518 --> 04:05.017
that I barely remember.

04:05.053 --> 04:07.352
This is my home.

04:07.388 --> 04:09.420
I love this country.

04:09.456 --> 04:11.823
And I'm proud of what
I have contributed.

04:11.859 --> 04:13.324
As you should be.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.294
Who else knows?

04:15.330 --> 04:16.862
Just a few people
over the years.

04:16.898 --> 04:18.596
You can't do it alone.

04:18.632 --> 04:19.831
You need allies,

04:19.867 --> 04:21.031
people that you can trust.

04:21.067 --> 04:24.302
And you can trust me.

04:24.338 --> 04:25.506
Of course.

04:29.576 --> 04:31.510
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

04:31.546 --> 04:33.979
You're undocumented,
and you decide to date

04:34.015 --> 04:36.347
the Assistant Director
of the FBI?

04:36.383 --> 04:39.518
He didn't exactly
lead with that.

04:39.554 --> 04:42.621
And by the time I knew,
it was too late.

04:42.657 --> 04:43.626
I was in love.

04:47.729 --> 04:49.798
We're needed
at the office.

05:04.578 --> 05:06.679
- Bonjour, monsieur.
- Oh, not today, Rich.

05:06.715 --> 05:08.647
Chamomile. Paper.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.049
I just wanted to check on
the status of my request.

05:11.085 --> 05:12.917
You're not going
to that party, Rich.

05:12.953 --> 05:15.487
It's not <i>that</i> party.
It's <i>the</i> party.

05:15.523 --> 05:17.556
<i>Le Soirée Foncé...</i>
the Dark Party.

05:17.592 --> 05:18.924
Where the best and brightest

05:18.960 --> 05:21.393
of the worst and the darkest
of the web come to meet.

05:21.429 --> 05:22.895
My answer's
the same as it's been

05:22.931 --> 05:24.797
the last three times:
Hell no.

05:24.833 --> 05:26.498
I'm not about to send
a recovering cyber felon

05:26.534 --> 05:27.732
to dark web Mardi Gras.

05:27.768 --> 05:29.934
Uh, if you want me to be
your crack consultant

05:29.970 --> 05:32.638
on all things deep web,
I need to stay on brand.

05:32.674 --> 05:34.739
I could definitely come back
with some actionable intel.

05:34.775 --> 05:36.845
For the last time,
request denied.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.746
Assistant Director Reade.

05:41.782 --> 05:43.915
Nas, good to see you.
I hope.

05:43.951 --> 05:44.950
Oh!

05:44.986 --> 05:46.518
Look who's back
from her Brexit!

05:46.554 --> 05:47.819
Pleasure to see you
again, mum.

05:48.657 --> 05:50.522
Uh, sorry,
what's he doing here?

05:50.558 --> 05:53.595
He works with us now,
and it's a long story.

05:55.162 --> 05:56.595
Right.

05:56.631 --> 05:58.397
Well...

05:58.433 --> 06:00.131
I have two items of interest.

06:00.167 --> 06:02.600
First, I've learned
that Sandstorm

06:02.636 --> 06:03.905
was initially funded by...

06:05.140 --> 06:06.571
Hank Crawford?

06:06.607 --> 06:08.006
- Can you prove it?
- Not yet.

06:08.042 --> 06:09.073
How'd you get the intel?

06:09.109 --> 06:11.542
Well, since my time at the NSA

06:11.578 --> 06:14.412
came to a rather
unceremonious end,

06:14.448 --> 06:17.549
I've been freelancing
for Keaton at the CIA.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.417
What?

06:19.453 --> 06:20.986
Why didn't you tell us
that Nas was CIA?

06:21.022 --> 06:23.554
- 'Cause I didn't know.
- I'm a well-kept secret,

06:23.590 --> 06:25.691
even at the agency.

06:25.727 --> 06:27.126
My work there
mainly consists of

06:27.162 --> 06:29.994
helping with the ongoing
interrogation of Ellen Briggs,

06:30.030 --> 06:31.600
a.k.a. Shepherd.

06:34.636 --> 06:38.102
Oh, right, Jane's mom,
the terrorist.

06:38.138 --> 06:39.804
My second item of interest

06:39.840 --> 06:42.640
is that I've learned
through back channels

06:42.676 --> 06:45.143
that the NSA's regional office
was breached,

06:45.179 --> 06:47.679
and someone stole this.

06:47.715 --> 06:49.948
"Nergal," an extremely dangerous

06:49.984 --> 06:51.984
NSA-created computer virus.

06:52.020 --> 06:54.486
Wait, the Nergal virus
is real?

06:54.522 --> 06:55.888
That's, like,
a scary story

06:55.924 --> 06:57.789
that you tell young hackers
around a campfire.

06:57.825 --> 07:00.592
Named for the Mesopotamian
god of pestilence,

07:00.628 --> 07:02.895
which just happens to be
on Jane's body.

07:02.931 --> 07:04.797
An image enhancement

07:04.833 --> 07:07.732
shows a hidden numerical
structure within her tattoo

07:07.768 --> 07:10.835
that matches the key
coding elements of the virus.

07:10.871 --> 07:13.604
Nergal's like the successor
to the Stuxnet virus, right?

07:13.640 --> 07:16.674
The one that let us sabotage
Iran's nuclear program?

07:16.710 --> 07:18.143
Yeah, sped up their centrifuges

07:18.179 --> 07:20.179
to the point of total
system overload.

07:20.215 --> 07:22.681
Yes, but this one
works remotely.

07:22.717 --> 07:24.183
You just need the box.

07:24.219 --> 07:25.717
Theoretically,
anything with

07:25.753 --> 07:27.785
a mechanized system
pushed to the point of collapse.

07:27.821 --> 07:29.020
If they stole
it, we have to assume

07:29.056 --> 07:31.023
they're gonna use it soon.

07:31.059 --> 07:32.628
We need to find
this device now.

07:35.162 --> 07:37.229
A few days ago,
Nergal started trending

07:37.265 --> 07:38.564
on some of the web's
more nefarious

07:38.600 --> 07:40.566
and out-of-the way forums.

07:40.602 --> 07:42.534
And from that,
we found a link to this...

07:44.739 --> 07:47.672
Oh, whoa...
that timer is new.

07:47.708 --> 07:49.508
They're showing
what the device can do.

07:49.544 --> 07:50.708
Can you ID the ship?

07:50.744 --> 07:51.809
There's no
identifying markers.

07:51.845 --> 07:53.514
It could be one
of thousands.

07:56.583 --> 07:57.785
Oh, my God.

07:59.921 --> 08:01.587
If that was just
the proof of concept,

08:01.623 --> 08:02.653
whoever's doing this...

08:02.689 --> 08:03.922
Is just getting started.

08:09.176 --> 08:14.176
Subtitles by explosiveskull

08:15.213 --> 08:18.383
Okay, reports are coming in.
Four dead, 22 wounded.

08:18.419 --> 08:20.657
- Massive environmental fallout.
- Someone took control,

08:20.693 --> 08:22.460
turned the function speed
up to 11,

08:22.496 --> 08:23.994
and then... kaboom.

08:24.030 --> 08:25.862
We need to secure that device
before there's another attack.

08:25.898 --> 08:27.297
Any leads on who did this?

08:27.333 --> 08:29.934
- I have a theory.
- W-Wait, shut up, shut up.

08:29.970 --> 08:31.334
What? What do you see?

08:31.370 --> 08:34.304
Yeah. Excuse me.

08:34.340 --> 08:35.839
- Right... there.
- What is that?

08:35.875 --> 08:37.375
- A bad pixel?
- No.

08:37.410 --> 08:38.642
It's a calling card.

08:38.678 --> 08:41.477
Now, let's see who we are
dealing with...

08:41.514 --> 08:43.280
P-U-K.

08:43.316 --> 08:44.982
PopUpKid.

08:45.018 --> 08:46.650
Oh, that's bad.

08:46.686 --> 08:47.485
How bad?

08:47.521 --> 08:49.886
Well, on a scale
of one to terrible,

08:49.922 --> 08:51.488
this is full-on terrible.

08:51.524 --> 08:53.757
PopUpKid pops up
once every few years

08:53.793 --> 08:55.525
with a new virus
or piece of tech,

08:55.561 --> 08:57.328
pulls off
some crazy stunt,

08:57.364 --> 08:58.328
and then disappears.

08:58.364 --> 08:59.463
Nobody knows who they are

08:59.499 --> 09:00.865
or what they look like.

09:00.901 --> 09:02.732
Actually, I think I do.

09:02.768 --> 09:05.468
So I've been looking for
anything weird on the books

09:05.504 --> 09:08.472
at the NSA since the device
was last confirmed secure.

09:08.508 --> 09:10.775
No forced entry into the room
where it was being held,

09:10.811 --> 09:13.376
which means it was
either an inside job

09:13.412 --> 09:14.812
or a forged access key.

09:14.848 --> 09:16.414
Or both.

09:16.450 --> 09:17.647
What's clear is that no matter

09:17.683 --> 09:19.650
how the device got out
of the room...

09:19.686 --> 09:20.950
They still had to get it
out of the building.

09:20.986 --> 09:22.386
Yes. Move.

09:22.422 --> 09:24.621
- Whoop!
- Enter Betty Dupree,

09:24.657 --> 09:27.357
NSA employee who was
wheeled out of the office

09:27.393 --> 09:29.092
after suffering a seizure
at her desk.

09:29.128 --> 09:30.660
She was taken to county,

09:30.696 --> 09:32.663
where she was treated
and then released.

09:32.699 --> 09:35.665
Only... the hospital doesn't
have a record of her name.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.834
Because they realized
it was super fake.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.437
Betty Dupree doesn't exist.

09:39.473 --> 09:40.905
Shouldn't the NSA
have caught that?

09:40.941 --> 09:44.541
Yeah, except the person
overseeing personnel and ID...

09:44.577 --> 09:47.511
Was Betty, who we now know
is also PopUpKid.

09:47.547 --> 09:49.780
Any idea what her
real identity is?

09:49.816 --> 09:51.881
Well, she's done some
serious scrubbing

09:51.917 --> 09:54.919
to bury that...
I mean, she's... good.

09:54.955 --> 09:57.054
- But she's no you.
- She's no me.

09:57.090 --> 09:58.521
Okay, here we go.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.924
A profile pic from back
in her pre-hacking days.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.525
- Wow.
- It's a facial match.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.929
Her profile says her name
is Delilah Dunny.

10:04.965 --> 10:05.932
Let's find her.

10:10.903 --> 10:12.770
Hey.

10:12.806 --> 10:14.538
Thanks for covering for me
back there.

10:14.574 --> 10:16.774
If they knew I knew
about you being in the CIA,

10:16.810 --> 10:19.477
your work
with the tattoos, uh...

10:19.513 --> 10:20.578
Yeah, of course.

10:20.614 --> 10:22.847
These things are
best kept secret.

10:22.883 --> 10:26.887
Has Patterson found out
about Project Dragonfly?

10:29.589 --> 10:30.320
No.

10:30.356 --> 10:32.789
- Not yet.
- Well, when it comes out,

10:32.825 --> 10:34.924
and it will...

10:34.960 --> 10:37.928
be prepared to be very unpopular
with your friends.

10:37.964 --> 10:40.030
They won't understand.

10:40.066 --> 10:42.670
These are
the sacrifices we make.

10:57.216 --> 10:58.783
- Tom, are you okay?
- Yeah.

10:58.819 --> 11:00.818
Just been getting
these headaches.

11:00.854 --> 11:01.922
I'm okay.

11:02.989 --> 11:04.521
Well, what are you
working on?

11:04.557 --> 11:07.724
Oh, just a little project
for your dad.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.459
It's your next assignment.

11:09.495 --> 11:11.962
This is the FBI team
that's after me.

11:11.998 --> 11:13.997
Make sure they
don't interfere again.

11:14.033 --> 11:16.132
I want them dead.

11:16.168 --> 11:18.135
Well, I hate
to drag you away,

11:18.171 --> 11:20.036
but I have plans
for you today.

11:20.072 --> 11:23.174
Well, for you, absolutely.

11:23.210 --> 11:24.909
My father was disappointed,

11:24.945 --> 11:26.709
to say the least, when
the land deal fell through,

11:26.745 --> 11:28.913
and he's been
looking at alternatives.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.484
Let me guess.

11:31.651 --> 11:33.016
- You found one.
- Yes.

11:33.052 --> 11:35.553
A man named Jean-Paul Bruyere

11:35.589 --> 11:37.954
has exactly what we're
looking for, and today,

11:37.990 --> 11:39.490
we're gonna go get it.

11:39.526 --> 11:41.525
Well, you seem
pretty sure of yourself.

11:41.561 --> 11:42.992
Belgian, right?
Obscenely rich?

11:43.028 --> 11:46.030
The only problem is that
the Bruyeres and the Crawfords

11:46.066 --> 11:48.031
have a bit of a rocky history.

11:48.067 --> 11:50.534
So, it's gonna take
some smoothing over

11:50.570 --> 11:52.636
if we're gonna
get into bed with them.

11:52.672 --> 11:54.838
Wait, so today we're gonna
get into bed with them?

11:54.874 --> 11:55.740
No.

11:55.776 --> 11:58.943
His son, Christophe.
They call him Junior.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.711
He's in town playing
a very exclusive card game,

12:00.747 --> 12:02.078
which we're about to crash.

12:02.114 --> 12:05.182
You'll have to pose as
my bodyguard, not my boyfriend.

12:05.218 --> 12:06.684
And if all goes well...

12:06.720 --> 12:09.786
hopefully we can
strike a deal.

12:09.822 --> 12:12.555
I love it when
you talk strategy.

12:14.060 --> 12:16.660
- Hey.
- We're not talking about Meg.

12:16.696 --> 12:18.228
- Didn't say anything.
- You're about to.

12:18.264 --> 12:19.896
You're using your
"we need to talk" voice.

12:19.932 --> 12:21.832
Saw that Jonathan West
from the State Department

12:21.868 --> 12:23.833
was coming in
for a briefing today.

12:23.869 --> 12:24.968
When I asked you

12:25.004 --> 12:27.203
why you were meeting
with him in secret,

12:27.239 --> 12:29.139
you said it was
to help someone.

12:29.175 --> 12:31.541
- It's Meg, isn't it?
- Tasha...

12:31.577 --> 12:32.842
You're using
your position at the FBI

12:32.878 --> 12:35.078
to secure your girlfriend's
legal status?

12:35.114 --> 12:36.981
- Watch it.
- No, you watch it.

12:37.017 --> 12:40.217
It's not just your career
you're putting on the line.

12:40.253 --> 12:42.620
It is Meg's whole life.

12:42.656 --> 12:43.991
I'm handling it.

12:46.593 --> 12:48.058
Please tell me
you have some good news.

12:48.094 --> 12:49.226
We have <i>some</i> good news.

12:49.262 --> 12:50.693
"Some" being
the operative word.

12:50.729 --> 12:51.694
We couldn't locate Delilah,

12:51.730 --> 12:53.564
but we did find this.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.932
It's an auction.

12:54.968 --> 12:56.934
She's selling the device,
which means the attack

12:56.970 --> 12:58.836
on the freighter was
just a demonstration.

12:58.872 --> 13:00.737
Every major criminal
and terrorist group in the world

13:00.773 --> 13:02.006
is gonna be after this.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.841
We have to buy it
before someone else does.

13:03.877 --> 13:06.075
Well, that's the very
not good news.

13:06.111 --> 13:08.645
This is a screen grab
that we found,

13:08.681 --> 13:10.780
but this is the live link.

13:10.816 --> 13:12.283
The auction ended
five minutes ago.

13:12.319 --> 13:13.284
So we're too late.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.055
Somebody already bought it.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.398
I turned over a few rocks,
worked a little of my

13:20.434 --> 13:22.129
patented Dicky Dots magic...

13:22.165 --> 13:23.963
Just tell us you found
the buyer of the device.

13:23.999 --> 13:25.598
Jeez, can I build up
to it a little?

13:25.634 --> 13:27.833
Patterson, if you wouldn't mind.

13:27.869 --> 13:30.237
I give you Tropic Song, LLC.

13:30.273 --> 13:32.805
- And should that mean something to us?
- I don't know.

13:32.841 --> 13:34.174
Is it meaningful that
they were just the victims

13:34.210 --> 13:39.179
of a cyber-theft to the tune
of 52,378,000 big ones?

13:39.215 --> 13:42.649
The exact amount Delilah
sold the device for.

13:43.853 --> 13:45.117
How did you find this
so quickly?

13:45.153 --> 13:46.919
Because I happen to have
my finger on the pulse

13:46.955 --> 13:48.621
of the dark web,
that's how.

13:48.657 --> 13:50.323
I mean, for now,
which is why I think

13:50.359 --> 13:51.891
Assistant Director Eeyore
over there

13:51.927 --> 13:53.827
should really reconsider
the whole party thing.

13:53.863 --> 13:55.929
Ain't gonna happen, Rich.
Patterson.

13:55.965 --> 13:58.332
Uh, once Rich ID'd
the hack-ee,

13:58.368 --> 14:00.067
I was able
to track the hacker.

14:00.103 --> 14:03.870
Cameron Miller,
16 years old, sky-high IQ,

14:03.906 --> 14:05.671
but he's been kicked out
of three schools.

14:05.707 --> 14:08.074
The last one for hacking into

14:08.110 --> 14:11.812
a laptop camera
in a female classmate's bedroom.

14:11.848 --> 14:14.084
- Lovely.
- Let's bring him in.

14:15.718 --> 14:17.918
Don't pull any punches.

14:17.954 --> 14:20.654
Sometimes my grandson needs
to learn things the hard way.

14:20.690 --> 14:22.322
Who did you buy
the device from?

14:22.358 --> 14:23.693
How are you gonna use it?

14:24.724 --> 14:26.793
I bought the device,
uh, from Screw You.

14:26.829 --> 14:28.728
And I'm gonna use it
for shut the hell up

14:28.764 --> 14:30.030
and get out of my face.

14:30.066 --> 14:32.332
Do you wanna spend
the night in jail, boy?

14:32.368 --> 14:35.001
We're not talking
about a night.

14:35.037 --> 14:36.870
Your grandson
stole $50 million,

14:36.906 --> 14:38.939
and he used half of that
as a down payment

14:38.975 --> 14:40.240
on a weapon
of mass destruction.

14:40.276 --> 14:42.041
Making you an accessory
to this morning's

14:42.077 --> 14:43.709
freighter explosion.

14:43.745 --> 14:44.877
Cammy, I don't know
what the hell

14:44.913 --> 14:46.045
you've gotten
yourself into here,

14:46.081 --> 14:47.747
but you need to talk
to these people.

14:47.783 --> 14:49.815
How about you just
mind your own business?

14:49.851 --> 14:53.219
Uhh! I tried
so hard with you.

14:53.255 --> 14:55.091
What are you
so damn angry about?

14:58.695 --> 15:00.894
I've gotten more empathy
out of serial killers.

15:00.930 --> 15:03.063
He just seems broken.

15:03.099 --> 15:04.430
How does someone
even get that way?

15:04.466 --> 15:05.765
I don't know.

15:05.801 --> 15:07.400
He's already handed over
half the money

15:07.436 --> 15:09.001
to take this box
off the market,

15:09.037 --> 15:11.137
which means Delilah has to
wait for the other half.

15:11.173 --> 15:12.304
Yeah, and when Cameron
doesn't pay up,

15:12.340 --> 15:13.439
it's only a matter of time

15:13.475 --> 15:15.007
until she finds
another buyer.

15:15.043 --> 15:16.910
We should get Nas and Patterson
to have a crack at it.

15:16.946 --> 15:18.278
Hopefully they found
something on his hard drive

15:18.314 --> 15:19.312
to soften him up a bit.

15:19.348 --> 15:21.113
Yeah.

15:21.149 --> 15:21.781
It's from Avery.

15:21.817 --> 15:24.184
She says
she's got something.

15:24.220 --> 15:25.318
You should come with me.

15:25.354 --> 15:27.990
Oh... she texted you,
not me.

15:29.057 --> 15:31.991
- It's fine.
- Don't read too much into it.

15:32.027 --> 15:34.160
If she's got something
that can help us...

15:34.196 --> 15:35.261
You have to follow the lead.

15:35.297 --> 15:36.667
- Yeah.
- Go.

15:37.834 --> 15:39.770
- It's okay. Go.
- All right.

15:45.273 --> 15:46.439
Hello, Cameron.

15:46.475 --> 15:49.742
Or should we say
MasterSharkButt817?

15:49.778 --> 15:51.812
That is a classy handle,
by the way.

15:51.848 --> 15:53.179
We know that
you owe PopUpKid

15:53.215 --> 15:55.748
the other half of the money
for the device.

15:55.784 --> 15:56.817
Just tell us where and when.

15:56.853 --> 15:58.184
Yeah, no thanks.

15:58.220 --> 16:00.053
We've been combing
through your computer...

16:00.089 --> 16:01.855
well, the parts that
you didn't erase, anyway...

16:01.891 --> 16:04.190
and we learned a lot about
the businesses you robbed.

16:04.226 --> 16:07.727
Yeah, mainly
that they didn't do...

16:07.763 --> 16:11.030
any business,
like, none at all,

16:11.066 --> 16:12.833
before you ripped them off.

16:12.869 --> 16:14.333
In fact, the company
didn't even exist

16:14.369 --> 16:15.935
until a few weeks ago.

16:15.971 --> 16:17.938
Almost as if
someone created it

16:17.974 --> 16:19.772
for the sole purpose
of robbing it.

16:19.808 --> 16:21.073
Strange, that.

16:21.109 --> 16:22.976
See, with a little knowhow,

16:23.012 --> 16:24.810
Tropic Song can be traced
through a network

16:24.846 --> 16:28.115
of shell companies
all the way back to Iran.

16:28.151 --> 16:31.150
Iran? What the hell
did you do?

16:31.186 --> 16:33.987
- Those guys weren't Iranian.
- Oh, really?

16:34.023 --> 16:35.155
Is that what they told you?

16:35.191 --> 16:36.789
They wanted the device,

16:36.825 --> 16:38.158
they needed a middle man
to buy it,

16:38.194 --> 16:40.293
and you were stupid enough
to fall for it.

16:40.329 --> 16:42.462
They even set up
a shell for you to steal from.

16:42.498 --> 16:45.198
- Easy, right?
- I bet they even told you that they were gonna

16:45.234 --> 16:47.800
take care of it when
you got caught too, right?

16:47.836 --> 16:50.139
Spoiler alert:
they won't.

16:53.508 --> 16:54.908
These guys
contacted me online,

16:54.944 --> 16:56.510
and they said they'd give me
a million dollars.

16:56.546 --> 16:58.844
All that I had to do
was steal some money

16:58.880 --> 17:01.948
that was already theirs
from a company they created

17:01.984 --> 17:04.183
so that they could get
the box from PopUpKid.

17:04.219 --> 17:06.852
How was PopUpKid
supposed to contact you?

17:06.887 --> 17:08.521
They gave me
a burner phone and...

17:08.558 --> 17:10.227
and told me
he'd call me on it.

17:11.394 --> 17:13.125
It's in my locker
at school.

17:19.868 --> 17:21.237
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

17:23.171 --> 17:24.103
Is that...

17:24.138 --> 17:25.471
Hello, Junior.

17:25.507 --> 17:28.874
The Blake Crawford I know
has braces, pigtails,

17:28.910 --> 17:30.342
and a cast on her arm.

17:30.378 --> 17:32.012
You certainly have changed.

17:32.048 --> 17:34.214
Arm got better,
braces came off.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.082
So I see.

17:35.118 --> 17:36.983
I was in town
and wanted to play cards.

17:37.019 --> 17:39.285
I heard my old friend Junior
had a game going.

17:39.321 --> 17:42.221
So... here I am.

17:42.257 --> 17:45.025
Sorry, but this club
maintains a strict

17:45.061 --> 17:46.525
gentlemen only policy.

17:46.561 --> 17:48.365
They let you in,
didn't they?

17:50.198 --> 17:50.831
Sorry.

17:50.867 --> 17:53.336
My bodyguard
forgets himself.

17:54.936 --> 17:56.902
No girls allowed, huh?

17:56.938 --> 17:58.404
That's too bad.

17:58.440 --> 18:02.141
Guess I'm gonna have
to drink this all myself.

18:02.177 --> 18:05.477
Ever wonder what a $600,000
bottle of scotch tastes like?

18:05.513 --> 18:07.546
I mean,
how much better can it be

18:07.582 --> 18:10.316
than a $300,000 bottle?

18:10.352 --> 18:12.252
All right.

18:12.288 --> 18:13.320
You're in.

18:13.356 --> 18:18.028
Now, let's open that bottle
and find you a seat.

18:28.471 --> 18:30.169
Hey.

18:30.205 --> 18:32.037
What information
did Avery have?

18:32.073 --> 18:34.040
Uh... none,
as it turns out.

18:34.076 --> 18:37.214
She just wanted to apologize
for colluding with Roman.

18:38.246 --> 18:39.478
She could have done that
over the phone

18:39.514 --> 18:41.614
instead of tricking you
into coming over.

18:41.650 --> 18:44.050
Yeah, I think she's lonely.

18:44.086 --> 18:46.253
Well, then why doesn't
she reach out to me?

18:46.289 --> 18:48.225
For the same reason
that you don't.

18:49.492 --> 18:51.194
I don't think
she knows how.

18:52.661 --> 18:53.627
Okay.

18:53.663 --> 18:56.196
So this is the phone

18:56.232 --> 18:59.064
Delilah is supposed to call
Cameron on to finish the deal.

18:59.100 --> 19:01.066
- What do we got?
- Two missed calls.

19:01.102 --> 19:02.936
- Blocked number.
- We need to track those calls

19:02.972 --> 19:04.070
before she moves on
to someone else.

19:04.106 --> 19:05.371
Here we go.

19:05.407 --> 19:06.973
Rich Dotcom.

19:07.009 --> 19:08.374
<i>Very funny,</i>

19:08.410 --> 19:09.509
<i>but you're just some</i>

19:09.545 --> 19:12.379
<i>4chan bro who found
$50 million somewhere.</i>

19:12.415 --> 19:13.979
Uh... fake news.

19:14.015 --> 19:15.282
This is Rich Dotcom.

19:15.318 --> 19:17.516
I just like to know
who I'm dealing with

19:17.552 --> 19:20.419
before I expose myself.

19:20.455 --> 19:22.225
Delilah.

19:25.293 --> 19:28.128
<i>Very few people have been able
to figure out my real name,</i>

19:28.164 --> 19:29.629
<i>and most of them are dead.</i>

19:29.665 --> 19:31.163
Enough foreplay.

19:31.199 --> 19:32.231
You, me,

19:32.267 --> 19:33.667
and your little friend Nergal.

19:33.703 --> 19:35.368
What's say we pick a spot

19:35.404 --> 19:38.705
and consummate
this little devil's three-way?

19:38.741 --> 19:42.042
<i>Oh, my God,
you are Rich Dotcom.</i>

19:42.078 --> 19:44.177
<i>Okay, okay,
we can meet in the park...</i>

19:44.213 --> 19:47.147
Uh, park's a little...
public, don't you think?

19:47.183 --> 19:49.181
<i>All right, there's
an abandoned warehouse...</i>

19:49.217 --> 19:50.550
That's a bit on the nose,
isn't it?

19:50.586 --> 19:52.584
We can do better
than that.

19:52.620 --> 19:54.987
Oh, I have an idea...

19:55.023 --> 19:58.257
Perhaps you've heard
of <i>Le Soirée Foncé.</i>

19:58.293 --> 20:01.026
The dark Party?
It's tonight.

20:01.062 --> 20:02.161
<i>Fine.</i>

20:02.197 --> 20:03.162
<i>Get me on the list,</i>

20:03.198 --> 20:04.331
<i>and I'll see you there...</i>

20:04.367 --> 20:06.131
- <i>Rich.</i>
- Ciao for now.

20:06.167 --> 20:08.435
What the hell
did you just do?

20:08.471 --> 20:11.141
I mean, it looks like
we're going to a party.

20:13.210 --> 20:15.311
You choose a hacker party
I explicitly told you

20:15.347 --> 20:17.438
you couldn't go to?
People's lives are at stake.

20:17.474 --> 20:19.207
Do you want to be
off this team?

20:19.243 --> 20:22.142
First: Somebody had
to answer the phone, right?

20:22.178 --> 20:24.344
Two: Never meet
on the other guy's turf.

20:24.380 --> 20:27.582
And "C": I mean,
it worked, didn't it?

20:27.618 --> 20:29.316
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

20:29.352 --> 20:31.518
but... I think
he made the right call.

20:31.554 --> 20:33.187
You've always been
my favorite.

20:33.223 --> 20:34.421
Okay, if we do the meet
at the party,

20:34.457 --> 20:36.356
there's almost
no chance of backup.

20:36.392 --> 20:38.558
Yeah, it's on an isolated island
off the coast.

20:38.594 --> 20:40.630
If things go sideways, it'll take
support a while to get there.

20:41.732 --> 20:43.430
What do you think, Kurt?

20:43.466 --> 20:45.833
I agree with Nas...
I don't like it,

20:45.869 --> 20:47.235
but this is Rich's world.

20:47.271 --> 20:48.705
I do think that
he's our best bet.

20:50.474 --> 20:53.474
Fine. But you're crazy if you
think you're going alone.

20:53.510 --> 20:56.510
Pfft! You think I'm rolling in
without an entourage? Come on.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.312
Keep me updated.

20:58.348 --> 21:00.318
Do I have time
to get my nails done?

21:03.219 --> 21:04.621
Jonathan.

21:05.888 --> 21:07.255
Didn't expect
to see you so soon.

21:07.291 --> 21:08.555
I'm here on other business.

21:08.591 --> 21:10.190
I only have a minute,
but we need to talk.

21:10.226 --> 21:12.560
Of course. Appreciate you
taking the time.

21:12.596 --> 21:14.294
As I'm sure you're aware,
some things at the upper levels

21:14.330 --> 21:16.397
of the State Department
have changed... a lot.

21:16.433 --> 21:17.497
Okay. And...

21:17.533 --> 21:19.667
And everything I do is under
more intense scrutiny now,

21:19.703 --> 21:23.271
including sensitive
immigration issues.

21:23.307 --> 21:25.372
- What are you saying?
- I'm sorry, Edgar.

21:25.408 --> 21:26.873
My hands are tied.

21:26.909 --> 21:27.874
I can't break the rules
right now.

21:27.910 --> 21:29.377
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:29.413 --> 21:30.945
No one asked you
to break any rules.

21:30.981 --> 21:32.513
I can't even bend them
right now.

21:32.549 --> 21:35.686
Not without compromising myself.
It's too risky.

21:37.253 --> 21:38.753
I'm late for this briefing.

21:38.789 --> 21:40.558
Be careful, okay?

21:46.897 --> 21:50.230
I'm going to have to fold.
Nicely played.

21:50.266 --> 21:52.265
Well, I win again!

21:52.301 --> 21:53.801
This is so much fun.

21:53.837 --> 21:58.176
I am off to nurse my wounds
and satisfy my thirst.

21:58.875 --> 22:00.440
Shall I refresh your drink?

22:00.476 --> 22:01.342
Oh, sure.

22:01.378 --> 22:03.513
Might be a while
before I can get up again.

22:09.352 --> 22:11.552
Your boss is
quite the woman.

22:11.588 --> 22:13.920
How long is
she staying in Rio?

22:13.956 --> 22:16.256
She's not...
and her boyfriend...

22:16.292 --> 22:18.692
Oh, please.
A boyfriend I can handle.

22:20.664 --> 22:23.467
How long have you
been in love with her?

22:26.936 --> 22:28.869
You have been
staring at her all night.

22:28.905 --> 22:31.605
It's a classic story
but a tragic one.

22:31.641 --> 22:34.275
The servant boy...

22:34.311 --> 22:35.713
and the princess.

22:37.848 --> 22:39.417
Never ends well.

22:49.326 --> 22:52.430
Ohh, it feels good
to be home.

22:53.397 --> 22:54.562
Don't get too comfortable.

22:54.598 --> 22:56.296
We're here
to do a job, remember?

22:56.332 --> 22:57.430
Marriage has changed you.

22:57.466 --> 22:59.367
You used to love
a good party.

22:59.403 --> 23:01.802
Now look, I know you're
all here as my chaperones,

23:01.838 --> 23:03.336
but I need you to do me
a favor and just try

23:03.372 --> 23:04.505
to blend in, all right?

23:04.541 --> 23:05.872
These are my people.
Don't embarrass me.

23:05.908 --> 23:07.874
You don't want <i>us</i>
to embarrass <i>you?</i>

23:07.910 --> 23:08.909
Yeah!

23:08.945 --> 23:10.844
We'll try.
Come on.

23:15.017 --> 23:17.351
Let's find Delilah
and get the box.

23:17.387 --> 23:19.320
Reade, you got us?

23:19.356 --> 23:21.488
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

23:28.031 --> 23:29.929
<i>The party is
using private ferries</i>

23:29.965 --> 23:31.765
to get the guests
onto the island.

23:31.801 --> 23:34.368
I hacked into the boat company's
website to track them.

23:34.404 --> 23:35.669
If Delilah hasn't arrived yet,

23:35.705 --> 23:37.541
I may be able
to give you guys a heads up.

23:39.775 --> 23:40.908
Nothing here.

23:40.944 --> 23:42.546
- You?
- Nope.

23:45.415 --> 23:47.047
I gotta say, uh,
I'm a little surprised

23:47.083 --> 23:48.381
that you're working
for Keaton.

23:48.417 --> 23:50.287
Beggars can't be choosers.

23:52.054 --> 23:54.854
Nas, what you did
for the team,

23:54.890 --> 23:57.024
falling on
your own sword...

23:57.060 --> 23:58.592
that meant a lot to us.

23:58.628 --> 24:00.061
Yeah, well,
doing the right thing

24:00.097 --> 24:02.095
doesn't always
come with a reward.

24:02.131 --> 24:03.631
Yeah.

24:03.667 --> 24:05.666
Jane and you
seem very happy.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.569
We're not.
We're getting there.

24:08.605 --> 24:11.371
And speaking of that,
when she left,

24:11.407 --> 24:13.541
I could have
used your help.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.743
Or at least your contacts.

24:15.779 --> 24:17.077
I reached out to you.

24:17.113 --> 24:18.746
You didn't
return my calls.

24:18.782 --> 24:20.680
I wouldn't have been
any help, Kurt.

24:20.716 --> 24:22.917
I couldn't even
save my own career.

24:22.953 --> 24:24.118
Maybe I can
arrange something

24:24.154 --> 24:26.053
- for you to come back to the FBI.
- No.

24:26.089 --> 24:29.523
I still feel that my place
is back with the NSA.

24:29.559 --> 24:31.057
Even if they can't
see that just yet.

24:31.093 --> 24:32.058
Okay.

24:32.094 --> 24:34.128
Let me know
if I can help.

24:34.164 --> 24:35.830
You already are.

24:35.866 --> 24:37.931
Then the guy in the leather mask
is like...

24:39.436 --> 24:41.569
I just about lost it.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.704
Mm-mm!

24:43.740 --> 24:45.906
Long story short,
if you're going to an opium den,

24:45.942 --> 24:47.842
they do not allow photos.

24:47.878 --> 24:50.410
Excuse me for a second.
I see a friend.

24:50.446 --> 24:51.544
Can I borrow this?

24:51.580 --> 24:52.979
Hi! Can I interest you
in a beverage?

24:53.015 --> 24:54.448
Could you possibly be

24:54.484 --> 24:55.783
drawing any more
attention to yourself?

24:55.819 --> 24:57.685
I am just trying to stay
in character here, okay?

24:57.721 --> 24:59.786
Unlike you, Lady Dour
of Dour-ton Abbey.

24:59.822 --> 25:01.689
You know, you're allowed
to have fun at work.

25:01.725 --> 25:02.790
Look at all these people...
they're dancing,

25:02.826 --> 25:04.425
they're drinking,
they're consuming

25:04.461 --> 25:05.993
various top-shelf
recreational pharmaceuticals.

25:07.164 --> 25:08.595
Oh, my God,
did you just...

25:08.631 --> 25:11.098
Oh, I'm allergic
to the carpets here, all right?

25:11.134 --> 25:12.999
Okay, see that?
That patented death stare?

25:13.035 --> 25:16.606
- That is your problem.
- You can get that finger out of my face any time.

25:17.640 --> 25:18.738
Okay.

25:18.774 --> 25:20.106
You know, I don't want
to get too personal,

25:20.142 --> 25:21.441
but I'm definitely going to,

25:21.477 --> 25:22.877
and I say this
completely out of love,

25:22.913 --> 25:23.911
but you know how you are?

25:23.947 --> 25:25.946
Are you really surprised
that Avery went to Weller

25:25.982 --> 25:27.113
and not you?

25:27.149 --> 25:28.448
Who was talking
about Avery?

25:28.484 --> 25:29.717
How do you even
know about that?

25:29.753 --> 25:31.451
And I know that people
think that your husband

25:31.487 --> 25:33.787
is supposed to be the big,
strong, burly tough guy,

25:33.823 --> 25:35.523
but you are
way more intimidating.

25:35.559 --> 25:36.823
I'm not intimidating.

25:36.859 --> 25:38.659
Your daughter is not
gonna come to you, okay?

25:38.695 --> 25:40.894
Avery is a child.
You're the adult.

25:40.930 --> 25:42.662
You gotta go to her.

25:42.698 --> 25:45.568
Oh, my God, would I make
a cool dad or what?

25:46.936 --> 25:48.602
Looks like another ferry
just pulled up.

25:48.638 --> 25:50.504
This could be the one.

25:50.540 --> 25:52.640
<i>Stay on your toes, people.</i>

25:56.045 --> 25:57.178
Got eyes on her.

25:57.214 --> 25:58.179
Enter me.

25:58.215 --> 25:59.979
Nas, if you...

26:00.015 --> 26:01.518
would do me the honor?

26:04.521 --> 26:06.219
Delilah Dunny...

26:06.255 --> 26:07.854
a.k.a. PopUpKid.

26:07.890 --> 26:09.556
You weren't planning
an Irish exit, were you?

26:09.592 --> 26:14.929
Rich Dotcom.
Hi, a.k.a. MasterSharkButt817.

26:14.965 --> 26:15.863
Who's this?

26:15.899 --> 26:19.800
This is Gwendolyn
Tuffington Havershire,

26:19.836 --> 26:22.870
my head of security,
among other things.

26:22.906 --> 26:23.871
Okay.

26:23.907 --> 26:24.639
So...

26:24.675 --> 26:26.540
Why don't we,
um, make a deal

26:26.576 --> 26:28.808
where you sell me
what you stole for money?

26:28.844 --> 26:29.642
Yes.

26:29.678 --> 26:31.879
Um, ahem, I, uh...

26:31.915 --> 26:34.818
Okay, um, I have...
I have come here at great risk

26:35.849 --> 26:37.217
to sell you something that could
change the course of history.

26:37.253 --> 26:40.220
Do I have... No, no,
I mean, do you have...

26:40.256 --> 26:41.721
Sorry, um...

26:41.757 --> 26:44.658
I'm gonna start over, um...

26:44.694 --> 26:46.861
I'm sorry, this was
a mistake, I gotta go.

26:46.897 --> 26:48.228
Delilah, Delilah.

26:48.264 --> 26:49.964
Everything is gonna be
just fine.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.966
Just... just breathe.

26:52.002 --> 26:53.199
Uh, actually, can you show me
where the bathroom is?

26:53.235 --> 26:54.567
I think I'm gonna vomit.

26:54.603 --> 26:55.835
Yeah, of course.
It's just over there.

26:55.871 --> 26:57.204
If she goes and I see it
I'm gonna...

26:57.240 --> 26:58.943
Okay. Go ahead.
Go ahead.

27:00.877 --> 27:01.808
Whew!

27:01.844 --> 27:03.276
Nice work
keeping her here.

27:03.312 --> 27:05.579
Thank Nas.
She's incredibly Zen.

27:05.615 --> 27:06.814
Let's just hope
she can keep Delilah calm

27:06.850 --> 27:08.615
long enough
for us to do this.

27:08.651 --> 27:10.955
Rich Dotcom!

27:14.323 --> 27:16.223
What is Sho Akhtar
doing here?

27:16.259 --> 27:18.025
Rich Dotcom!

27:19.061 --> 27:20.160
What are you doing?

27:20.196 --> 27:21.562
Take the gun
out of his mouth.

27:21.598 --> 27:22.996
I don't know.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.931
He was extradited to Pakistan
after we arrested him.

27:24.967 --> 27:27.066
He knows us.
So get ready to abort.

27:27.102 --> 27:28.635
Take it easy,
puddin', okay?

27:28.671 --> 27:30.304
The night that you met him,
he was flying on cocaine.

27:30.340 --> 27:31.604
He probably doesn't
even remember you.

27:31.640 --> 27:32.973
Okay? Just be cool.

27:33.009 --> 27:34.775
Well, well, well.

27:34.811 --> 27:38.081
If it isn't my old friends
from the FBI.

27:39.683 --> 27:42.019
So he does remember you.

27:43.066 --> 27:45.135
What a nice surprise...
I didn't know

27:45.171 --> 27:47.451
there'd be pork
at this party.

27:47.487 --> 27:50.034
Sho Akhtar.
Back from the dead.

27:50.070 --> 27:51.669
You're supposed to be serving

27:51.705 --> 27:54.139
a life sentence
in a Pakistani prison right now.

27:54.175 --> 27:55.640
How did you get out?

27:55.676 --> 27:57.376
I was released almost
as soon as I landed.

27:57.412 --> 27:58.709
What can I say?

27:58.745 --> 28:01.045
Something of
a hometown legend.

28:01.081 --> 28:02.947
Ah, but I'm curious.

28:02.983 --> 28:04.882
If this room
of bloodthirsty criminals

28:04.918 --> 28:06.717
learned there were
feds here...

28:06.753 --> 28:08.687
how long would you last?

28:08.723 --> 28:10.121
And Rich,
my old friend.

28:10.157 --> 28:12.123
- Sho. Buddy.
- I should kill you right now

28:12.159 --> 28:14.825
- for selling me out in the first place.
- Selling <i>you</i> out?

28:14.861 --> 28:16.194
How about when you
double-crossed me in Zürich?

28:16.230 --> 28:17.763
You know, I still can't
look at a cabbage roll.

28:17.799 --> 28:18.863
You know I was only
getting you back

28:18.899 --> 28:19.965
for what you did
on Carl's plane.

28:20.001 --> 28:21.399
Oh, Carl's plane
is a hunk of junk.

28:21.435 --> 28:23.735
- Are you kidding me? I did them a favor.
- Enough! Enough!

28:23.771 --> 28:25.137
Why are you here?

28:25.173 --> 28:26.838
Well, somebody's gotta
breathe some life

28:26.874 --> 28:28.206
into this damn funeral.

28:28.242 --> 28:30.042
Bump? Bump?

28:30.078 --> 28:32.276
Bumpity-bump-bump?

28:32.312 --> 28:33.712
I don't mind
if I do.

28:35.950 --> 28:37.248
You know what I don't get?

28:37.284 --> 28:39.383
What's that... Riggs?

28:39.419 --> 28:41.152
Pakistanis hate you
more than we do.

28:41.188 --> 28:43.854
So the fact that you're not
rotting in a hole in Karachi

28:43.890 --> 28:45.424
tells me that
you turned on somebody

28:45.460 --> 28:47.024
that's even worse
than yourself.

28:47.060 --> 28:50.762
Yeah, somebody who probably
has friends at this funeral.

28:50.798 --> 28:52.764
Wouldn't take us long
to figure out who they are.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.202
Still have to prove it.

28:55.403 --> 28:57.002
Oh, yeah, you know what?

28:57.038 --> 29:00.104
These guys look like
sticklers for due process.

29:00.140 --> 29:03.475
Looks like mutually assured
destruction to me.

29:03.511 --> 29:05.276
Fine.

29:05.312 --> 29:08.082
I'll play nice.
For now.

29:11.184 --> 29:12.883
<i>No way this is a coincidence.</i>

29:12.919 --> 29:14.285
Sho's there to steal
the device.

29:14.321 --> 29:15.454
And he knows
we are too.

29:15.490 --> 29:17.188
Look, we already have Delilah.

29:17.224 --> 29:18.924
We just have to keep Sho
occupied long enough

29:18.960 --> 29:20.425
to finish the deal
and get the hell out of there.

29:20.461 --> 29:21.993
I'm willing to bet
Sho doesn't know

29:22.029 --> 29:23.895
what PopUpKid
looks like yet.

29:23.931 --> 29:27.198
As far as he knows,
she could be anybody.

29:27.234 --> 29:28.833
Maybe we can use that.

29:28.869 --> 29:31.469
Well, don't keep
a girl in suspense.

29:31.505 --> 29:33.271
What's it gonna be?

29:33.307 --> 29:35.474
All-in.

29:35.510 --> 29:38.246
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

29:41.249 --> 29:42.813
All-in.

29:56.897 --> 29:58.396
You had me worried.

29:58.432 --> 29:59.997
You are good.

30:00.033 --> 30:02.466
- Not good enough, apparently.
- You're not leaving, are you?

30:02.502 --> 30:05.504
After that hand,
I need another drink.

30:05.540 --> 30:06.838
Of course.

30:06.874 --> 30:09.174
Who wants to lose
some more money?

30:09.210 --> 30:10.876
You let him win.

30:10.912 --> 30:12.476
You had him beat
the whole game.

30:12.512 --> 30:13.978
Why'd you tank it?

30:14.014 --> 30:15.981
Well, sometimes
you've got to lose to win.

30:16.017 --> 30:17.181
I don't care about cards,

30:17.217 --> 30:19.086
we're playing
a bigger game here.

30:20.421 --> 30:21.386
I feel bad.

30:21.422 --> 30:22.853
Let me make it up to you.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.089
Once I'm done here,

30:24.125 --> 30:26.824
come with me
to the after party?

30:26.860 --> 30:28.863
Well, if you insist.

30:30.964 --> 30:33.234
You may want to tell
her boyfriend she'll be late.

30:41.041 --> 30:42.107
Okay.

30:42.143 --> 30:44.141
I'm approaching
PopUpKid now.

30:44.177 --> 30:45.310
Over.

30:46.580 --> 30:49.548
And now we're even
for Carl's plane.

30:49.584 --> 30:52.184
Bitch Dotcom.

30:52.220 --> 30:53.252
Okay.

30:53.288 --> 30:54.985
I notice you're all wearing
nice chains, by the way.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.154
Is that a standard-issue
thing or...

30:56.190 --> 30:57.555
Uhh!

30:57.591 --> 31:00.125
Ohh... I did not
do that right.

31:00.161 --> 31:03.265
I'm here for
the Nergal device.

31:04.932 --> 31:06.564
You're not my buyer.

31:06.600 --> 31:07.599
You're right.

31:07.635 --> 31:10.235
Sho Akhtar...

31:10.271 --> 31:11.369
at your service.

31:11.405 --> 31:13.938
And why should I sell
to somebody who I don't know?

31:13.974 --> 31:17.212
Because there's no business
like Sho business.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.445
And I give you three reasons
to buy from me.

31:20.481 --> 31:23.247
One: I'll double your price.

31:23.283 --> 31:26.484
Two: Rich is working
with the feds.

31:26.520 --> 31:29.387
And three: I had no idea

31:29.423 --> 31:32.389
PopUpKid would be
so damn beautiful.

31:32.425 --> 31:34.626
Well, that last one
was more of an observation

31:34.662 --> 31:36.026
than a reason.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.964
Assume I did
sell you my device.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.197
How do I know
that you would use it

31:40.233 --> 31:44.202
for something worthy
of its power? Hmm?

31:44.238 --> 31:46.905
Okay, okay. You wanna know
what else bothers me?

31:46.941 --> 31:49.107
Entitlement. Uck!

31:49.143 --> 31:51.943
The powerful bully,
the powerless, and...

31:51.979 --> 31:53.410
and these animals
need to learn

31:53.446 --> 31:54.579
that they're not immune.

31:54.615 --> 31:55.981
Which is why
I'm using this money

31:56.017 --> 31:57.115
to build something
ten times worse

31:57.151 --> 31:58.582
- than the Nergal virus.
- Okay.

31:58.618 --> 32:00.417
That is legit terrifying.

32:00.453 --> 32:02.353
But, um... and this is not
to rush you in any way

32:02.389 --> 32:03.455
with your snacking there.

32:03.491 --> 32:06.090
But my bodyguards and I
would love to make this swap,

32:06.126 --> 32:08.126
- if that's possible.
- And the sooner you get paid,

32:08.162 --> 32:10.227
the sooner you can make
every one else pay, right?

32:10.263 --> 32:11.596
- That's a really good idea.
- Yes.

32:11.632 --> 32:13.665
Sent you the authorization.

32:13.701 --> 32:15.332
- You just need to accept.
- Okay.

32:15.368 --> 32:18.003
- That little bar goes green.
- Whoo!

32:18.039 --> 32:19.971
- Transfer complete. Great.
- Thank you.

32:20.007 --> 32:21.639
- Hey, uh, canapé?
- Oh, sure.

32:23.644 --> 32:26.210
Um, now,
where's the device?

32:26.246 --> 32:29.214
Oh, okay, okay.
You think I have it on me.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.514
- Yeah.
- What do you think I am, stupid?

32:30.550 --> 32:32.950
No, there is a person
here at the party

32:32.986 --> 32:34.319
who ha...

32:34.355 --> 32:35.687
- Keep going.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:35.723 --> 32:37.155
Do these have nuts?

32:37.191 --> 32:39.623
Yeah, I wanna say pistachio?

32:41.061 --> 32:43.093
Okay.

32:43.129 --> 32:44.462
Shh, shh, slow, calm breathes.

32:46.300 --> 32:48.099
In here?
There's nothing in here.

32:48.135 --> 32:49.133
Just this EpiPen.

32:49.169 --> 32:51.503
Oh! Sorry.

32:54.541 --> 32:56.140
There you go.
Now...

32:56.176 --> 32:58.008
You said someone out there
has the device.

32:58.044 --> 32:59.677
Who is that? Who?

32:59.713 --> 33:01.212
She's... she's
reaching for her phone.

33:01.248 --> 33:03.648
The contact's
gotta be in there.

33:03.684 --> 33:04.983
Okay.

33:05.019 --> 33:07.319
It's locked.
Patterson.

33:07.355 --> 33:09.187
<i>Gotta find a backdoor
into this phone.</i>

33:09.223 --> 33:11.389
Who cares what I do
with the device?

33:11.425 --> 33:13.692
I'm giving you
$100 million.

33:13.728 --> 33:16.427
Whatever happened to
"the customer's always ri..."?

33:18.232 --> 33:20.165
Well, that's very interesting.

33:20.201 --> 33:22.199
60 seconds ago
I sent a photo of you

33:22.235 --> 33:25.070
to my good friends in my ear.

33:25.106 --> 33:26.571
They've been doing
some research.

33:26.607 --> 33:29.006
And you're not PopUpKid.

33:29.042 --> 33:30.074
Then who am I?

33:30.110 --> 33:32.010
You <i>were</i> Nas Kamal,

33:32.046 --> 33:33.244
formerly of the NSA.

33:33.280 --> 33:35.416
And now... you're dead.

33:36.716 --> 33:38.015
Kill her!

33:38.051 --> 33:39.553
I'll find the box.

33:49.363 --> 33:51.062
<i>I accessed Delilah's phone.</i>

33:51.098 --> 33:52.162
<i>Try it now.</i>

33:52.198 --> 33:54.032
There's only one contact.

33:54.068 --> 33:55.600
This has to be her man
with the box.

33:57.037 --> 33:58.336
Let's hope
we can ID him

33:58.372 --> 34:00.375
before he realizes
I'm not Delilah.

34:04.511 --> 34:06.044
There.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.411
FBI raid!

34:08.447 --> 34:10.047
Everybody run!

34:14.754 --> 34:17.190
Get down!
Get out of the way!

34:19.525 --> 34:20.995
No.

34:22.629 --> 34:24.195
He hasn't got it.

34:24.231 --> 34:25.533
Sho has the device.

34:26.464 --> 34:28.822
- Did you see which way he went?
- No, I didn't.

34:28.859 --> 34:30.859
I'll take the front exit,
you cover the back.

34:32.266 --> 34:34.136
Get out of here!
The door!

34:34.937 --> 34:35.900
No!

34:37.672 --> 34:38.674
Uhh!

34:40.841 --> 34:42.344
Uhh!

35:08.669 --> 35:09.604
Uhh!

35:22.316 --> 35:24.450
You okay?

35:24.486 --> 35:26.519
Come on, guys.
Give me some good news.

35:26.555 --> 35:28.387
Sho just got away
with the device.

35:28.423 --> 35:31.194
Well, you're half right.

35:35.964 --> 35:36.995
Nice work, everybody.

35:37.031 --> 35:39.265
Yep, the device is secured,

35:39.301 --> 35:40.599
and Delilah
is in custody.

35:40.635 --> 35:41.968
Sho Akhtar's
still in the wind.

35:42.004 --> 35:43.836
Eh, guys like him have
a way of popping up

35:43.872 --> 35:45.303
when you least
expect it.

35:45.339 --> 35:46.539
Or maybe not,
I mean, he does have

35:46.575 --> 35:47.840
a pretty serious
drug problem.

35:47.876 --> 35:48.941
He could die any time.

35:48.977 --> 35:50.709
Nas, thank you
for your help.

35:50.745 --> 35:52.611
Yeah, it's great
to have you back.

35:52.647 --> 35:54.847
You know,
I've, uh, I've missed this.

35:54.883 --> 35:57.316
Working with all of you.

35:57.352 --> 35:58.985
Yeah, even you, Rich.

35:59.021 --> 36:01.419
But it's time I go back
to where I belong.

36:01.455 --> 36:05.291
What, to the CIA?
Really?

36:05.327 --> 36:06.492
Why do I feel like
you're about to fly away

36:06.528 --> 36:07.792
on an umbrella right now?

36:09.464 --> 36:11.334
Goodbye, everyone.

36:13.334 --> 36:14.466
That was a Mary
Poppins reference

36:14.502 --> 36:16.334
in case
that wasn't clear.

36:16.370 --> 36:18.640
That part always
makes me cry.

36:20.809 --> 36:22.341
Hey, uh, Nas?

36:22.377 --> 36:24.610
Uh, before you go,

36:24.646 --> 36:26.378
I was wondering
if the next time

36:26.414 --> 36:28.347
you talk to Shepherd,

36:28.383 --> 36:30.015
if you could
ask her about Avery

36:30.051 --> 36:32.485
and, uh, why she
made me give her up.

36:32.521 --> 36:34.620
I'm not gonna
do that, Jane.

36:34.656 --> 36:36.821
I already know
the answer.

36:36.857 --> 36:40.626
Your mother is a sociopath
and a narcissist.

36:40.662 --> 36:42.595
The things
she took from you,

36:42.631 --> 36:45.564
they were all to keep you
from loving anyone but her.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.033
There's no mystery.
She just wanted to control you.

36:48.069 --> 36:50.468
I keep wondering
if there's something

36:50.504 --> 36:52.537
I could have done
to change her mind.

36:52.573 --> 36:54.006
To what end?

36:55.410 --> 36:57.443
You can't live
in the past, Jane.

36:57.479 --> 36:59.477
We're better served
putting all our efforts

36:59.513 --> 37:01.283
into what we can do now.

37:03.051 --> 37:04.787
Good luck, Jane.

37:09.024 --> 37:10.655
What? Okay.

37:10.691 --> 37:12.490
Go ahead then. You have
to tell him, by the way.

37:12.526 --> 37:14.427
- He's not getting it from me.
- I will, just calm...

37:14.463 --> 37:16.928
Hey... okay,
we have a problem.

37:16.964 --> 37:18.798
Something is wrong
with the device.

37:18.834 --> 37:20.932
It doesn't actually
do anything.

37:20.968 --> 37:23.035
It appears that
Delilah brought us a decoy.

37:24.939 --> 37:27.673
No... not Delilah.

37:27.709 --> 37:28.711
Nas.

37:34.115 --> 37:37.749
Nas said that she was going
back to where she belongs,

37:37.785 --> 37:39.552
so she's using that box

37:39.588 --> 37:41.454
to buy her way
back into the NSA.

37:41.490 --> 37:43.588
So, I guess the tat squad

37:43.624 --> 37:45.557
doesn't really score
any points for this one?

37:45.593 --> 37:47.792
- No.
- Well, she did keep us

37:47.828 --> 37:49.662
- from getting fired.
- I was in jail.

37:49.698 --> 37:52.064
And now the device
is off the market.

37:52.100 --> 37:54.599
A win's a win.

37:54.635 --> 37:56.369
You know,
doing the right thing

37:56.405 --> 37:58.740
doesn't always come
with a reward.

38:01.109 --> 38:02.407
Yeah.

38:06.680 --> 38:07.646
Hey, baby.

38:07.682 --> 38:08.713
Hey.

38:08.749 --> 38:10.149
Tough day?

38:10.185 --> 38:11.850
I sort of did something.

38:11.886 --> 38:14.553
There's a guy I know
at the state department.

38:14.589 --> 38:15.954
And it didn't work out,

38:15.990 --> 38:18.624
but he was helping me
fix your immigration status

38:18.660 --> 38:21.093
by changing
a few things around.

38:21.129 --> 38:22.861
Changing things around?

38:22.897 --> 38:25.497
You mean
falsifying documents?

38:25.533 --> 38:28.867
I have
falsified documents.

38:28.903 --> 38:30.638
I am trying to...

38:32.506 --> 38:33.738
How could you put us
both at risk like that?

38:33.774 --> 38:35.474
You need help,
I'm trying to help.

38:35.510 --> 38:36.975
Well, don't!
This is my thing.

38:37.011 --> 38:39.714
No, it's our thing, babe.
We're together, right?

38:42.617 --> 38:44.620
I-I just didn't
want to lose you.

38:50.191 --> 38:54.459
I was planning something
way more elaborate.

38:54.495 --> 38:56.028
Top of the Empire
State Building,

38:56.064 --> 38:57.896
Hamilton tickets.

38:57.932 --> 38:59.030
Your papers.

38:59.066 --> 39:00.166
Planning for what?

39:00.202 --> 39:01.937
I don't want
to wait anymore.

39:03.638 --> 39:05.905
Oh, Edgar, no, no.

39:05.941 --> 39:06.905
What are you... is...

39:06.941 --> 39:08.173
Meg...

39:08.209 --> 39:11.946
I love you...
with everything that I am.

39:13.214 --> 39:15.548
Will you marry me?

39:15.584 --> 39:16.782
You know that marrying me

39:16.818 --> 39:20.151
won't change the fact
that I am undocumented.

39:20.187 --> 39:23.155
They can throw me out,
and they can keep me out.

39:23.191 --> 39:25.624
That's not
why I'm doing this.

39:25.660 --> 39:27.526
I just want <i>you.</i>

39:27.562 --> 39:32.497
I want your goodness,
I want your problems.

39:32.533 --> 39:36.568
We can figure the rest out
later... together.

39:36.604 --> 39:39.838
Now, say yes, damn it.

39:41.276 --> 39:43.846
Yes, yes.
I say yes! I...

39:49.184 --> 39:50.653
Ohh!

39:54.722 --> 39:56.057
Oh!

40:02.597 --> 40:03.932
Hey.

40:06.066 --> 40:08.233
Hey.
Thanks for coming.

40:08.269 --> 40:09.968
Did something happen
with Crawford?

40:10.004 --> 40:12.137
What? Uh... no.

40:12.173 --> 40:14.240
No, I just thought
that you might...

40:14.276 --> 40:16.709
want to get
out of the safe house.

40:16.745 --> 40:17.880
Oh.

40:20.147 --> 40:21.280
Do you drink coffee?

40:21.316 --> 40:23.983
They make a great
hemp milk latte.

40:24.019 --> 40:25.850
Gross.

40:25.886 --> 40:26.986
Yeah.

40:27.022 --> 40:28.854
Um...

40:28.890 --> 40:31.856
I'll take a normal
black coffee, though.

40:31.892 --> 40:33.858
Fair enough.

40:33.894 --> 40:34.996
Um...

40:51.780 --> 40:53.778
I assume that
you're calling to apologize

40:53.814 --> 40:56.081
for stealing property
from the FBI.

40:56.117 --> 40:58.082
I have no idea
what you mean.

40:58.118 --> 40:59.818
My mistake, then.

41:00.622 --> 41:03.088
I'm calling because
I've uncovered

41:03.124 --> 41:06.291
some very interesting
information about Avery's dad.

41:06.327 --> 41:07.992
Turns out that
he was very involved

41:08.028 --> 41:10.762
in some of Crawford's
shady business practices.

41:10.798 --> 41:13.666
Okay, send me
what you got.

41:13.702 --> 41:14.937
<i>I already have.</i>

41:18.339 --> 41:19.274
Wait.

41:20.874 --> 41:22.240
I think we've made enough
of an impression.

41:22.276 --> 41:23.642
Let's get out of here.

41:23.678 --> 41:25.614
Is somebody jealous?

41:26.680 --> 41:28.046
Look, we'll just go
to the after party

41:28.082 --> 41:29.280
for a little bit.

41:29.316 --> 41:31.182
Think you can
survive that?

41:31.218 --> 41:33.017
Well, as long as
I'm the one leaving with you,

41:33.053 --> 41:34.022
I think I'll live.

41:35.689 --> 41:37.559
Right this way,
darling.

41:39.361 --> 41:41.964
Prepare for an evening
you won't forget.
