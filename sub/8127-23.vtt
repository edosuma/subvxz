            makes you hungry.

             makes you hungry.

Archie's footlong hot dogs      

01:24.084 --> 01:25.283
for dinner.                     

01:25.285 --> 01:26.651
That reminds me,                

01:26.653 --> 01:27.952
they gotta defrost.             

01:27.954 --> 01:29.954
I better go get them.           

01:29.956 --> 01:32.490

The kitchen ain't that way.

                in our kitchen. 

01:34.394 --> 01:36.294

            Jefferson's kitchen.

Why?                            

01:37.831 --> 01:40.799
Because I asked her to put      
  the hot dogs in her freezer

        Whenever I walk         
past a construction site,       

05:41.007 --> 05:44.409
     I like to look through     
the peepholes in the fence

to watch the men working.       

05:46.779 --> 05:49.480
    One time there was          
  somebody on the other side,   

05:49.482 --> 05:52.216

            Well...             

06:05.131 --> 06:07.298
 I don't like walking by there  

06:07.300 --> 06:09.934
    because the workers are

06:14.040 --> 06:17.541

 "Don't walk by there anymore."

                    Shut up.    

12:29.381 --> 12:30.815
        Got me through          
        to the detectives here. 

12:30.817 --> 12:32.750
            I don't want        
            to go to the police.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.152
    I'm embarrassed             
    to talk about it anymore.   

12:35.154 --> 12:37.688
                 All right,     
            thank you very much.

12:37.690 --> 12:40.791
        Yes, yes. Bye-bye.      

12:40.793 --> 12:42.226
          Well, your troubles   
          are over, little girl.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.829
You don't have to go down       
and talk to the cops after all. 

12:44.831 --> 12:47.498
                  Oh, thank you,
                  Daddy.        

12:47.500 --> 12:49.767
There's a cop coming over here. 

12:56.908 --> 12:58.676
    Thank you, Mrs. Stivic.     

12:58.678 --> 13:01.679
         That's a pretty good   
         description of the guy.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.781
            I got a hunch this  
            is a person we know.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.716
There, Edith, you hear          
what the officer says?          

13:05.718 --> 13:06.917
Maybe the police know           
this person.                    

13:06.919 --> 13:08.585
         Well, what happens now?

13:08.587 --> 13:10.354
Well, they find him             
and arrest him, right?          

13:10.356 --> 13:12.890
  Well, apprehending a suspect  
         is one thing.          

13:12.892 --> 13:14.859
         Convicting him         
    is something else.          

13:14.861 --> 13:16.193
Let me tell you something:      

13:16.195 --> 13:18.029
     Forty thousand arrests     
        in this country         

13:18.031 --> 13:19.263
      for rape last year,       

13:19.265 --> 13:21.065
    and less than 10 percent    
          convictions.          

13:21.067 --> 13:23.868
 Well, this guy will make 11%.  

13:23.870 --> 13:27.204
        Why don't               
    we get more convictions?    

13:27.206 --> 13:30.741
 Because the defense attorneys  
     get these rapists off.     

13:30.743 --> 13:32.710
             Now you take your  
             case, for instance.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.078
                Lawyer gets     
                you up on top   

13:34.080 --> 13:35.279
          of that witness stand,

13:35.281 --> 13:38.082
            and he might ask you
            something like, um, 

13:38.084 --> 13:40.051
          do you often walk past
          that building site?   

13:40.053 --> 13:41.952
  No, Michael told me not to.   

13:41.954 --> 13:43.754
        Why? Did he know        
you were seeing this man?       

13:43.756 --> 13:46.090
      I wasn't seeing him.      

13:46.092 --> 13:48.492
I saw him for the first time    
today when he jumped me.        

13:48.494 --> 13:51.896
Oh, you saw this man today      
  after your husband told you   

13:51.898 --> 13:53.397
          to stay away          
    from the building site?     

13:53.399 --> 13:56.100
     Well, it's Saturday.       
I thought it'd be all right--   

13:56.102 --> 13:58.703
You didn't have to walk on that 
  side of the street, did you?  

13:58.705 --> 14:00.104
    Even a chicken can          
         cross the road         

14:00.106 --> 14:01.906
          if he wants           
to get on the other side.       

14:01.908 --> 14:03.808
  Hey, hey, that's very true.   

14:07.579 --> 14:09.379
         Well, what about it?   
         You didn't have to walk

14:09.381 --> 14:10.981
            on that side of     
            the street, did you?

14:10.983 --> 14:12.717
You don't have to make          
insinuations like that.         

14:12.719 --> 14:14.885
            Listen,             
  I ain't making insinuations.  

14:14.887 --> 14:17.154
  I'm just trying to tell you   
     what these lawyers do.     

14:17.156 --> 14:19.356
 Some of those guys do anything 
to get their clients off.       

14:19.358 --> 14:20.557
 That's how they earn a living. 

14:20.559 --> 14:22.459
    By sending rapists          
     back onto the streets?     

14:22.461 --> 14:24.528
     That's right, and some     
    of our judges and juries    

14:24.530 --> 14:26.130
  give them a little help too,  
        you know.               

14:26.132 --> 14:29.200
        I was on a jury once,   
        a murder trial.         

14:29.202 --> 14:32.036
Oh, stifle yourself,            
will you?                       

14:32.038 --> 14:33.704
The detective                   
ain't interested                

14:33.706 --> 14:37.007
in no ren-emiscences            
of yours.                       

14:37.009 --> 14:38.375
Go make coffee, huh?            

14:38.377 --> 14:40.310
            Oh, sure, Archie.   

14:40.312 --> 14:41.612
        Excuse me.              

14:41.614 --> 14:42.813
Officer,                        
what other questions            

14:42.815 --> 14:44.048
might a lawyer ask              
Gloria?                         

14:44.050 --> 14:47.017
          Well, like,           
 do you go out with other men?  

14:47.019 --> 14:48.018
              No.               

14:48.020 --> 14:49.453
 You don't have no men friends? 

14:49.455 --> 14:51.222
 That's not what you asked me.  

14:51.224 --> 14:52.990
        Of course               
    I have some men friends.    

14:52.992 --> 14:53.991
What's wrong with that?         

14:53.993 --> 14:55.392
Most of them are                
my friends too.                 

14:55.394 --> 14:56.560
                Oh, like who?   

14:56.562 --> 14:59.596
  Oh, like, guys from school--  
         Lionel, Szabo.         

14:59.598 --> 15:00.697
             Szabo?             

15:00.699 --> 15:02.833
    Oh, forget Szabo,           
        he don't count.         

15:02.835 --> 15:05.936
     He's only a Hungarian.     

15:05.938 --> 15:07.171
     The guy is a painter.      

15:07.173 --> 15:08.172
        A housepainter?         

15:08.174 --> 15:09.974
        Oh, no, he don't        
        paint that good.        

15:11.777 --> 15:13.944
    He's a portrait painter.    
     Gloria posed for him.      

15:13.946 --> 15:14.945
                  Posed for him,
                  huh, Gloria?  

15:14.947 --> 15:16.413
Yes.                            

15:16.415 --> 15:18.715
    Oh, now, come on,           
 let's not get into this, huh?  

15:18.717 --> 15:21.152
Daddy, there's nothing wrong    
      with what I did.          

15:21.154 --> 15:22.853
I posed for Szabo in the nude.  

15:22.855 --> 15:24.889
        Oh, shush!              

15:26.158 --> 15:28.759
 Oh, you're a nude model, huh,  
            Gloria?             

15:28.761 --> 15:30.928
No, I'm not a nude model.       

15:30.930 --> 15:33.097
    I posed for Szabo           
    because he's our friend.    

15:33.099 --> 15:34.098
            Sure, sure, sure.

                 being friendly.

15:35.534 --> 15:38.869
             I'd say being nude,
             alone in a studio  

15:38.871 --> 15:40.137
                  with a painter

                 very friendly.

 you passed that building site?

you're trying to do?

                to the rape guy 

15:53.186 --> 15:55.319
         when he gets him on the
         witness stand, right?  

15:55.321 --> 15:57.521
  Wrong. The accused is not     
required to appear on the stand.

15:57.523 --> 15:58.722
I don't believe it.             

15:58.724 --> 16:00.524

 she has to take the stand!

17:33.584 --> 17:34.751
                Listen, tell us,

17:34.753 --> 17:36.220
            what else goes on   
            in the courtroom?   

17:36.222 --> 17:38.822
  Wait a minute. I don't think  
  I want to go on with this.    

17:38.824 --> 17:40.624
    Once you get into court,    
     you'll have no choice.     

17:40.626 --> 17:41.825
They're gonna ask you           
questions like,                 

17:41.827 --> 17:43.027
"What clothes were              
you wearing                     

17:43.029 --> 17:45.595
when you enticed that poor guy  
on the building site?"          

17:45.597 --> 17:46.897
            Entice?             
            I didn't entice--   

17:46.899 --> 17:48.399
Were you wearing                
a tight sweater?                

17:48.401 --> 17:49.466
No.                             
      Mini-skirt?               

17:49.468 --> 17:51.101
It was short,                   
but it's not a mini.            

17:51.103 --> 17:53.203
          You get a kick out of 
          guys whistling at you?

17:53.205 --> 17:55.439
            No.                 
    You enjoy egging them on?   

17:55.441 --> 17:56.540
            No!                 
                     Like today?

17:56.542 --> 17:57.541
            No!                 
                    Yes, you do.

17:57.543 --> 17:58.542
            No! No!             
                      All right.

17:58.544 --> 17:59.543
                  All right,    
                  that's enough.

17:59.545 --> 18:00.710
         That's enough.         
            Gloria--            

18:00.712 --> 18:01.912
 Just leave me alone, Michael!  

18:01.914 --> 18:03.447
             Look,              
  I know you're trying to help, 

18:03.449 --> 18:05.249
but don't you think             
you came down on her            

18:05.251 --> 18:06.383
a little too hard?              

18:06.385 --> 18:08.885
            Ma, I don't think   
            I can go through    

18:08.887 --> 18:10.754
             with all those     
             questions in court.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.823
Gloria, all day today           

18:12.825 --> 18:14.891
I've been smelling              
Rockaway Beach.                 

18:14.893 --> 18:16.493
                        What?   

18:16.495 --> 18:19.129
I remember lots of things       
through the smell.              

18:19.131 --> 18:23.067
Archie used to say, "Edith,     
your memory's in your nose      

18:23.069 --> 18:26.437
and the rest of your brain      
is in your little finger."      

18:27.405 --> 18:29.073
  Ma, what about Rockaway Beach?

18:29.075 --> 18:31.308
It was a double date            

18:31.310 --> 18:34.544
with a couple                   
of wrong numbers                

18:34.546 --> 18:36.847
that Elsie Argyle               
got to know                     

18:36.849 --> 18:38.615
from working                    
the switchboard.                

18:38.617 --> 18:41.285
Oh, at first                    
it was kind of fun.             

18:41.287 --> 18:43.454
One of the boys                 
could bend his thumbs           

18:43.456 --> 18:47.257
all the way back until          
they touched his wrists.        

18:47.259 --> 18:50.294
Elsie got him.                  

18:50.296 --> 18:53.397
    Ma, I know you're trying    
to make a point here somewhere. 

18:53.399 --> 18:55.099
Sit down, Gloria.               

18:59.270 --> 19:03.507
    Me and my date was          
 coming out of the penny arcade 

19:03.509 --> 19:06.843
        where we'd been         
 playing the pinball machines,  

19:06.845 --> 19:09.113
      and he took me aside      

19:09.115 --> 19:14.084
  and he said, "How'd you like  
 a malted under the boardwalk?" 

19:18.656 --> 19:22.026
  A little voice inside of me   
          said, "No!"           

19:22.028 --> 19:25.762
but on the outside I said,      
            "Okay."             

19:25.764 --> 19:27.231
            Oh, Ma.             

19:27.233 --> 19:29.233
 Well, I don't have to tell you 

19:29.235 --> 19:32.236
      there was no malted       
      under the boardwalk.      

19:34.472 --> 19:36.606
      Just a wrong number,      

19:36.608 --> 19:39.476
         grabbing at me         
      and pushing me down.      

19:39.478 --> 19:40.877
 Just like what happened to me  
             today.             

19:40.879 --> 19:44.181
     Yeah, only with sand.      

19:45.983 --> 19:49.319
 Ma, what happened? He didn't-- 

19:49.321 --> 19:53.157
            Oh, no.             
I ran from him like crazy.      

19:53.159 --> 19:55.325
    But how did you get away    
        from him?               

19:56.827 --> 20:01.465
Well, my father taught me       
          two things.           

20:01.467 --> 20:05.335
 One was, never order hamburger 
        in a drug store         

20:05.337 --> 20:09.673
    and the other was           
     something about knees.     

20:14.612 --> 20:16.246
            Oh, Ma.             

20:16.248 --> 20:22.252
  Gloria, I never told no one   
    about this before,          

20:22.254 --> 20:26.856
      because in my time,       
we was too scared to talk open. 

20:26.858 --> 20:30.394
     But what I'm saying is     
     maybe we should have,      

20:30.396 --> 20:31.695
    because over the years,     

20:31.697 --> 20:33.997
      I've often wondered       
      how many other girls      

20:33.999 --> 20:38.402
          that man got          
     under the boardwalk...     

20:38.404 --> 20:41.572
 and how many didn't get away.  

20:44.375 --> 20:45.642
            DETECTIVE:          
            Listen, who knows   
            with juries?        

20:45.644 --> 20:46.977
                  Sometimes they
                  take a look   

20:46.979 --> 20:48.378
                  at a cute dame
                  like your wife

20:48.380 --> 20:49.580
                  and figure she
                  asked for it. 

20:49.582 --> 20:50.647
            Maybe they're right.

20:50.649 --> 20:52.048
What do you mean,               
"Maybe they're right"?          

20:52.050 --> 20:54.451
I mean, a smart lawyer is       
 going to do everything he can  

20:54.453 --> 20:55.586
     to make her look bad.      

20:55.588 --> 20:57.687
  Take that posing in the nude  
        your wife done.         

20:57.689 --> 21:00.624
    Now, you tell me that's     
    all right. Maybe it is.     

21:00.626 --> 21:02.726
 But that's all a smart lawyer  
          got to hear.          

21:02.728 --> 21:04.861
            Hear that, Meathead?
            That's your fault.  

21:04.863 --> 21:07.897
        You let her go bare in  
        front of that Hungarian.

21:07.899 --> 21:09.500
              You want that to  
              come out in court?

21:09.502 --> 21:11.268
            You want to put your
            wife through that?  

21:11.270 --> 21:13.637
    Of course not, but what     
    alternatives do we have?    

21:13.639 --> 21:16.240
        We don't need no        
 what-do-you-call, alternative. 

21:16.242 --> 21:19.075
          All we need           
    is something else to do.    

21:20.411 --> 21:21.745
    Michael.                    

21:21.747 --> 21:22.912
                Gloria, look.   

21:22.914 --> 21:24.714
No, uh, Michael,                
I have to tell you something.   

21:24.716 --> 21:26.617
I've decided to do              
whatever I have to do           

21:26.619 --> 21:28.051
to catch that man.              

21:28.053 --> 21:30.854
     Good, we'll notify you     
    when we make the arrest.    

21:30.856 --> 21:32.088
                     Good?      

21:32.090 --> 21:33.524
          Everything you've said
          has gone against      

21:33.526 --> 21:34.724
            taking this thing   
            into court.         

21:34.726 --> 21:36.126
         Wait a minute,         
    I never said that.          

21:36.128 --> 21:38.728
You just asked me what was      
going to happen to her in court,

21:38.730 --> 21:40.063
        and I told you.         

21:40.065 --> 21:42.466
    Now if you're asking me     
what to do as a police officer, 

21:42.468 --> 21:43.567
    I say make the complaint    

21:43.569 --> 21:45.169
and follow through with it      
          all the way.          

21:45.171 --> 21:46.403
Well, we're going to.           

21:46.405 --> 21:47.837
             No, no, no,        
             we're not going to.

21:47.839 --> 21:50.106
         That's right,          
      we're not going to.       

21:50.108 --> 21:51.941
Well, what about                
all this talk to me             

21:51.943 --> 21:53.843
about my duty                   
to the community?               

21:53.845 --> 21:55.078
                Listen,         
                little girl--   

21:55.080 --> 21:57.281
Will you just stay out of this? 
    Let me handle it.           

21:57.283 --> 21:58.682
            Ask her about her   
            duty to herself.    

21:58.684 --> 22:00.284
             Ask her about her  
             duty to her family.

22:00.286 --> 22:02.286
            Ask her if she wants
            to be in the papers.

22:02.288 --> 22:03.620
    Will you please--?          
                     Talk, then!

22:03.622 --> 22:05.822
    Gloria, I don't want you    
getting up on that witness stand

22:05.824 --> 22:08.592
  and getting smeared like you  
were some kind of a tramp.      

22:08.594 --> 22:10.827
      Yeah, you want to look    
      like some kind of a tramp?

22:10.829 --> 22:11.861
        Archie, please!         

22:11.863 --> 22:13.330
             Look,              
  are you reporting it or not?  

22:13.332 --> 22:14.598
No, no, we're not reporting it. 

22:14.600 --> 22:15.599
      Thank you very much,      
            officer.            

22:15.601 --> 22:16.667
But, Michael, I--               

22:16.669 --> 22:18.268
        Gloria! I know          
    what's best for my wife.    

22:18.270 --> 22:19.670
Look, I ain't got all day here. 

22:19.672 --> 22:21.271
        We ain't going to report
        it there, officer.      

22:21.273 --> 22:23.006
I want to thank you             
for coming over                 

22:23.008 --> 22:24.274
so fast.                        
                        Okay.   

22:24.276 --> 22:26.210
    There is one other thing.   
Yeah?                           

22:26.212 --> 22:28.011
    You know that colored guy   
    that was here before?       

22:28.013 --> 22:29.446
Yeah.                           
    You know him pretty good?   

22:29.448 --> 22:31.515
Yeah,                           
he's a neighbor, why?           

22:31.517 --> 22:34.184
Is he really coming back        
with those footlong hot dogs?   

22:34.186 --> 22:37.153
Yeah, he'll be back             
with them okay.                 

22:37.155 --> 22:38.555
          You know,             
          I gave him five bucks.

22:38.557 --> 22:39.756
Oh, no, don't worry             
about that.                     

22:39.758 --> 22:41.358
He's one of the good ones.      
                    Oh, good.   

22:41.360 --> 22:43.393
         Have him drop them over
         at the precinct for me,

22:43.395 --> 22:44.428
                    will you?   

22:44.430 --> 22:45.862
Hey, I'll drop them off         
there myself.                   

22:45.864 --> 22:47.664
Thanks a million.               
Thanks for coming.              

22:47.666 --> 22:49.199
Michael...                      

22:49.201 --> 22:51.000
     Michael, are you sure      
  we're doing the right thing?  

22:51.002 --> 22:53.002
No, I'm not sure we're doing    
the right thing, Gloria.        

22:53.004 --> 22:54.638
I don't know                    
what the right thing is.        

22:54.640 --> 22:56.840
I know I'm trying to do         
the right thing for you!        

22:56.842 --> 22:58.442
You should have heard           
some of the things              

22:58.444 --> 22:59.443
that guy said.                  

22:59.445 --> 23:00.711
            Some of those things

23:00.713 --> 23:02.279
            will make your flesh
            stand on end.       

23:02.281 --> 23:03.714
        But Daddy,              

23:03.716 --> 23:06.617
 that maniac is still out there 
    on the streets somewhere,   

23:06.619 --> 23:08.452
        and so are              
    a lot of innocent girls!    

23:08.454 --> 23:09.919
        What about them?        

23:09.921 --> 23:12.522
 Let them bring him into court  
        if they want to!        

23:12.524 --> 23:14.625
      I ain't responsible       
 for all the girls in New York. 

23:14.627 --> 23:16.593
Gloria, all I care about is you.

23:16.595 --> 23:18.395
        That's right, and that's
        what he should,         

23:18.397 --> 23:19.596
                  care about his
                  own wife.     

23:19.598 --> 23:20.964
                 And the women  
                 under his roof.

23:20.966 --> 23:22.366
All right, Arch.                
I said it, okay?                

23:22.368 --> 23:24.934
                Well, I want    
                to say it again.

23:24.936 --> 23:27.571
          It's everybody for    
          himself in this world.

23:27.573 --> 23:32.476
     As our president said      
in his re-negural address,      

23:32.478 --> 23:33.977
     "You're on your own."      

23:39.817 --> 23:43.853
  Don't expect... Don't expect  
      nothing from nobody,      

23:43.855 --> 23:46.657
especially the government.      

23:46.659 --> 23:48.659
             You should sit down
             and ask yourself,  

23:48.661 --> 23:50.093
                  "What can I do
                  for myself?"  

23:50.095 --> 23:51.895
        and find out what you   
        can do for yourself,    

23:51.897 --> 23:53.363
                go out and do it
                for yourself.   

23:53.365 --> 23:54.531
                 The more people
                 done that,     

23:54.533 --> 23:56.866
        this be a better country
        in which to live in.    

23:56.868 --> 23:59.235
          Do for your own,      
          take care of your own.

23:59.237 --> 24:00.937
                That's the rule.

24:00.939 --> 24:04.007
                That's what we  
                done here today.

24:04.009 --> 24:06.576
                    We took care
                    of our own. 

24:17.254 --> 24:18.588
Hot dogs, everybody!            

24:18.590 --> 24:19.856
                    Oh, yeah.   

24:19.858 --> 24:21.291
Great. Great.                   

24:21.293 --> 24:22.659
        Hold it!                

24:22.661 --> 24:25.562
  Hold it just a minute here.   

24:25.564 --> 24:27.831
    Them ain't my footlongs.    

24:27.833 --> 24:28.998
Oh, no, Archie.                 

24:29.000 --> 24:31.401
Mr. Jefferson was               
only able to get                

24:31.403 --> 24:32.636
the regular six-inch kind.      

24:32.638 --> 24:34.504
         Oh, well, I ain't      
         gonna eat none of them.

24:35.740 --> 24:36.906
        Oh, Daddy,              
     what's the difference?     

24:36.908 --> 24:38.308
 Just put two of them together. 

24:38.310 --> 24:39.476
            No good.            

24:39.478 --> 24:40.577
Why? They taste the same.       

24:40.579 --> 24:44.548
        No, they don't.         
      They taste shorter.       

25:02.734 --> 25:05.469
             [♪]                

25:05.471 --> 25:08.004
        ANNOUNCER:              
    All in the Family           
      <i>was recorded on tape</i>      

25:08.006 --> 25:09.439
