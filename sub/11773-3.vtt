WEBVTT

00:06.933 --> 00:09.467
( theme music playing )

00:15.267 --> 00:17.867
DID YOU CALL FUNKHOUSER?

00:17.900 --> 00:20.300
NO, I'LL SEND
A CARD OR SOMETHING.

00:20.333 --> 00:22.167
THAT'S TERRIBLE,
WHAT HAPPENED
TO HIS MOTHER.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.500
I KNOW.

00:23.533 --> 00:26.200
I MEAN, DRIVING A WHEELCHAIR,
GETTING HIT BY A CAR?

00:26.233 --> 00:28.267
- THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
- WASN'T A SURPRISE.

00:28.300 --> 00:30.467
- NO, IT WAS NOT A SURPRISE.
- COMPLETELY RECKLESS
IN THAT THING.

00:30.500 --> 00:34.167
WOW. YOU KNOW,
OVER ON SUNSET,

00:34.200 --> 00:36.933
THEY GOT A MEMORIAL SITE
ALL SET UP FOR HER.

00:36.967 --> 00:39.100
- REALLY?
- YEP. RIGHT WHERE
SHE GOT HIT.

00:39.133 --> 00:41.467
- HUH.
- ALL THESE FLOWERS.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.067
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE OWES ME $50
FROM GOLF.

00:44.100 --> 00:45.900
THAT'S $50 YOU'RE
NEVER GONNA SEE.

00:45.933 --> 00:48.867
- NEVER! NEVER GONNA
SEE THAT 50.
- NEVER EVER EVER EVER.

00:48.900 --> 00:51.400
YOU CAN'T ASK
A MOURNER FOR $50.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.967
- HUH.
- UH-HUH.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.067
WELL, I'M WAITING.

01:01.067 --> 01:02.767
YEAH, ME TOO.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.233
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

01:05.267 --> 01:06.900
- WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?
- I'M WAITING FOR YOU

01:06.933 --> 01:09.933
TO OFFER ME CONDOLENCES
FOR FUNKHOUSER'S MOTHER.

01:09.967 --> 01:11.633
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'M
WAITING FOR FROM YOU.

01:11.667 --> 01:13.767
I AM SO MUCH CLOSER
WITH MARTY THAN YOU ARE.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.433
I'VE KNOWN HIM
SO MUCH LONGER.

01:15.467 --> 01:18.100
HOWEVER LONG YOU'VE KNOWN
HIM IS IRRELEVANT
IN THIS EQUATION.

01:18.133 --> 01:20.167
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
I WATERED THE PLANTS.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.067
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:22.067 --> 01:24.100
- LET'S GO GET SOME ICE CREAM.
- OH, THAT'S JUST
WHAT HE NEEDS.

01:24.133 --> 01:26.800
- JUST WHAT HE NEEDS.
GO! ENJOY YOURSELF.
- THAT IS A GOOD IDEA!

01:26.833 --> 01:28.767
- ENJOY YOURSELVES.
- THANK YOU.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.733
OH, AND JEFF! DON'T FORGET,
WE'VE GOT THE INTERVIEW LATER

01:31.767 --> 01:33.267
FOR SAMMY
TO GET INTO DRYDEN.

01:33.300 --> 01:36.067
- VERY IMPORTANT.
- I'M ALL GOOD,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

01:36.067 --> 01:37.933
WHAT'S WITH YOU?
WHEN'S YOUR INTERVIEW?

01:37.967 --> 01:39.467
I THINK IT'S TOMORROW.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.533
IT WOULD BE VERY NICE
IF DARYL AND KEYSHA

01:41.567 --> 01:43.933
WENT TO THE SAME
SCHOOL AS SAMMY.
WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?

01:43.967 --> 01:45.767
HOW DO YOU KNOW
SAMMY'S GETTING IN?

01:45.800 --> 01:48.600
SAMMY HAPPENS TO BE
A VERY VERY BRIGHT GIRL.

01:48.633 --> 01:51.367
YEAH, WELL, KEYSHA AND DARYL
ARE NO SLOUCHES, EITHER.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.967
- WELL, GOOD.
- DARYL KNOWS THE WHOLE
MULTIPLICATION TABLE.

01:54.067 --> 01:55.600
WELL, THAT'S GREAT, LARRY,

01:55.633 --> 01:57.900
BUT I WOULDN'T TAKE
SO MUCH CREDIT, BECAUSE
IT'S NOT YOUR DNA.

01:57.933 --> 01:59.800
I SIT UP AT NIGHT
TEACHING IT TO 'EM.

01:59.833 --> 02:02.567
- SAMMY KNOWS MULTIPLICATION
AND DIVISION.
- ALL RIGHT, SHUT UP!

02:02.600 --> 02:04.567
- THAT'S IT,
LET'S GO! COME ON.
- LONG DIVISION!

02:04.600 --> 02:06.933
Jeff:
LET'S GO.
WHAT THE HECK?

02:11.533 --> 02:13.833
- I THINK I'LL GET CHERYL
AN ICE CREAM.
- VERY NICE.

02:13.867 --> 02:17.233
YEAH, WELL, ON THE DAYS
I WANT SEX I'M A LOT NICER.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.733
- REALLY?
- OH, YEAH, I'LL BE
NICE THE WHOLE DAY.

02:19.767 --> 02:21.533
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE SEX.

02:21.567 --> 02:23.567
AND THEN I'LL JUST GO BACK
TO BEING THE WAY I AM.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.900
- IT'S FASCINATING.
- AND IT WORKS FOR YOU.

02:25.933 --> 02:27.933
WHAT IS THAT BANANA THING?

02:27.967 --> 02:29.833
I LOVE THESE PEOPLE
THAT COME HERE,

02:29.867 --> 02:31.800
THEY GET 10 SAMPLES,
YOU KNOW?

02:31.833 --> 02:33.667
AND IT'S NOT RIGHT FOR
THE WOMAN WORKING BACK THERE.

02:33.700 --> 02:36.367
SHE'S GOT BETTER THINGS
TO DO THAN JUST SCOOPING
OUT SAMPLES FOR THEM.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.333
THEY'RE ALL SO GOOD.

02:38.367 --> 02:41.133
BUT WHAT-- WHAT IS THIS--
OH-- CHOC-- CHOCOLATE--

02:41.167 --> 02:43.533
LOOK AT THIS.
PEOPLE ARE WAITING.
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

02:43.567 --> 02:45.233
NO, IT'S NOT.

02:45.267 --> 02:48.400
YOU KNOW, I SHOULDN'T
BE EATING ICE CREAM.

02:48.433 --> 02:50.400
- NO, YOU SHOULDN'T.
- NO, I REALLY SHOULDN'T.

02:50.433 --> 02:51.900
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I CAME HERE FOR.

02:51.933 --> 02:54.133
I CAN'T EVEN BE--
YOU MIND IF I GO?

02:54.167 --> 02:56.700
- 'CAUSE IF I STAY HERE
I'LL HAVE NO SELF-CONTROL.
- GET OUT OF HERE!

02:56.733 --> 02:58.500
- ALL RIGHT, BYE.
- GET OUT.

02:58.533 --> 03:00.100
( bell jingles )

03:00.133 --> 03:03.400
CAN I TRY THE RAS--
RASPBERRY CHOCOLATE,
WHATEVER THAT IS?

03:03.433 --> 03:05.200
( bell jingles )

03:05.233 --> 03:07.067
GOT A LONG WAIT.

03:07.067 --> 03:08.733
Woman:
OOH, COULD I TRY
THE TIRAMISU?

03:08.767 --> 03:10.233
IT'S GOOD.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

03:10.267 --> 03:11.933
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
GET THAT. GET THAT.

03:11.967 --> 03:13.700
- I THINK I WILL.
THANK YOU.
- YEAH, GET THAT.

03:13.733 --> 03:15.767
AND I THINK I'D LIKE
TO TRY THE BANANA, PLEASE.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.100
BANANA!

03:17.133 --> 03:19.200
( laughs )
IT MIGHT TASTE LIKE...

03:19.233 --> 03:22.400
- LET ME GUESS, A BANANA?
- AND SOME CHOCOLATE.

03:22.433 --> 03:25.467
- I MEAN THIS IS REALLY RID--
THIS IS SO RUDE.
- JUST THE PLAIN CHOCOLATE.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.267
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
LIKE A SAMPLE ABUSER.
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

03:27.300 --> 03:30.133
- WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?
- YOU'RE ABUSING YOUR
SAMPLING PRIVILEGES.

03:30.167 --> 03:32.733
- ONE-- TWO SAMPLES, THE MOST.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE
THESE LITTLE SPOONS FOR?

03:32.767 --> 03:35.700
- YOU CAN'T JUST GO ON SAMPLE
AFTER SAMPLE-- NO YOU CAN'T!
- OH, YES, I CAN!

03:35.733 --> 03:38.800
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE
THE PLAIN VANILLA, PLEASE.

03:38.833 --> 03:41.667
- THANK YOU.
- OH! A DECISION'S
BEEN MADE!

03:41.700 --> 03:43.700
OH, WE GOT VANILLA!

03:43.733 --> 03:45.533
- ENJOY.
- THANK YOU.

03:47.167 --> 03:48.900
( bell jingles )

03:48.933 --> 03:50.567
VANILLA!
SHE WINDS UP WITH VANILLA.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.467
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.267
HOW IS THE VANILLA?

04:00.533 --> 04:02.300
Larry:
HEY! FUNKHOUSER!

04:03.800 --> 04:06.300
MY GOD,
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.067
YOU'RE OUT?

04:08.067 --> 04:09.833
- WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WELL, UH...

04:09.867 --> 04:11.500
THIS HELPS MY EMOTIONS.

04:11.533 --> 04:13.600
JOGGING'S THE BEST
THING FOR ME.

04:13.633 --> 04:16.267
SO, MOURNERS--
MOURNERS EXERCISE?

04:16.300 --> 04:18.233
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
- I DON'T KNOW IF
MOURNERS EXERCISE.

04:18.267 --> 04:20.900
- IT'S JUST GOOD FOR ME.
- INTERESTING.

04:20.933 --> 04:22.800
I'M GONNA
REMEMBER THAT NEXT TIME

04:22.833 --> 04:25.300
I LOSE A CLOSE
MEMBER OF MY FAMILY.

04:25.333 --> 04:26.867
YEAH. JOGGING.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.633
- HELPS EVERYTHING.
- BY THE WAY,

04:28.667 --> 04:30.800
I CALLED YOUR HOUSE.
I LEFT A CONDOLENCE MESSAGE.

04:30.833 --> 04:32.067
I NEVER GOT A RETURN CALL.

04:33.367 --> 04:35.400
WELL, I HAD A FEW
THINGS ON MY MIND.

04:35.433 --> 04:37.267
YEAH, STILL...

04:37.300 --> 04:39.067
IT'S A LITTLE DISCOURTEOUS.

04:40.667 --> 04:42.667
- LET ME EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO YOU.
- SURE.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.533
I LOST MY DAD A YEAR AGO.

04:44.567 --> 04:46.633
MY MOTHER JUST DIED.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.700
I'M AN ORPHAN, OKAY?

04:48.733 --> 04:50.867
- YOU'RE A WHAT?
- I'M AN ORPHAN.

04:50.900 --> 04:53.067
- ( laughs ) ORPHAN?
- YEAH, AN ORPHAN!

04:53.067 --> 04:54.500
YOU'RE A LITTLE TOO OLD
TO BE AN ORPHAN.

04:54.533 --> 04:56.167
NO, IF YOU DON'T HAVE
PARENTS YOU'RE AN ORPHAN.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.500
YOU COULD BE 70
AND BE AN ORPHAN?

04:57.533 --> 04:59.233
YOU COULD BE 100
AND BE AN ORPHAN!

04:59.267 --> 05:00.633
- YOU CAN'T BE 100
AND BE AN ORPHAN.
- YEAH, YOU CAN!

05:00.667 --> 05:03.867
( snickers ) OKAY.
LITTLE ORPHAN FUNKHOUSER.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.167
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING--

05:06.200 --> 05:08.300
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
BOTHERS ME A LOT IN LIFE,

05:08.333 --> 05:11.333
IS WHEN ICE CREAM DRIPS
DOWN THE SIDE OF A CONE.
DOESN'T THAT BOTHER YOU?

05:11.367 --> 05:14.533
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO BE
VERY VIGILANT WHEN YOU'RE
EATING ICE CREAM CONES.

05:14.567 --> 05:17.067
LOOK, THERE'S A LITTLE DRIP.
GET IT!

05:17.067 --> 05:19.467
OH, ANOTHER DRIP!
GOT IT!

05:19.500 --> 05:21.533
ARE YOU COMING
TO THE FUNERAL?

05:21.567 --> 05:23.700
OF COURSE I'M COMING
TO THE FUNERAL.

05:23.733 --> 05:26.233
OKAY, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THE $50 I OWE YOU
FOR THE GOLF BET.

05:26.267 --> 05:27.600
- OH MY GOD!
- HOLD THIS.

05:27.633 --> 05:29.567
$50-- I FORGOT ALL
ABOUT IT, THE $50.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.500
- YEAH.
- GREAT!

05:31.533 --> 05:34.567
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- TAKING OFF MY SHOE.
I GOT MONEY IN THE SHOE.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.867
- WHAT?!
- THERE YOU GO.

05:39.667 --> 05:41.567
UGH!

05:41.600 --> 05:42.900
- TAKE THE $50!
- NO, I DON'T WANT IT.

05:42.933 --> 05:45.067
- TAKE THE $50!
- I'D REALLY RATHER NOT.

05:45.067 --> 05:47.167
- I DON'T WANT THAT 50
FROM YOUR SWEATY...
- TAKE THE 50 BUCKS.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.900
- DISGUSTING SOCK AND SNEAKER.
- THIS IS THE PAYOFF.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.067
THAT'S-- I DON'T WANT THAT 50.
GIVE ME A CLEAN 50.

05:52.067 --> 05:53.867
- THIS IS THE 50 I HAVE.
- I'M NOT TOUCHING THAT 50.
I DON'T WANT IT.

05:53.900 --> 05:55.667
- TAKE THE 50.
- NO!

05:55.700 --> 05:57.200
- THEN I'M NOT PAYING YOU!
- WHAT?

05:57.233 --> 05:59.467
- I'M NOT PAYING YOU.
THIS IS THE $50.
- YOU OWE ME $50!

05:59.500 --> 06:01.300
- WHAT IF--
- THIS IS $50!

06:01.333 --> 06:03.400
IT'S PERFECTLY FINE.

06:03.433 --> 06:06.067
SEE? $50.

06:06.067 --> 06:08.100
- ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS BULLSHIT.
- TAKE IT.

06:08.133 --> 06:10.167
HOLD IT OUT.
HOLD IT OUT, FOLD IT UP.

06:11.167 --> 06:13.300
FOLD IT-- THAT'S IT, OKAY.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.200
PUT IT IN MY POCKET.

06:16.233 --> 06:17.900
YEAH, OKAY.
PUT IT IN THERE.

06:19.767 --> 06:20.933
THANK YOU.

06:23.567 --> 06:25.533
- HEY, CHERYL.
- WHAT'S UP, L.D.?

06:25.567 --> 06:27.067
- HEY!
- WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

06:27.100 --> 06:29.100
- ICE CREAM.
- ICE CREAM?

06:29.133 --> 06:31.667
OOH! I LOVE ICE CREAM.
WHAT FLAVOR DID YOU BRING US?

06:31.700 --> 06:34.300
ACTUALLY, UH...

06:34.333 --> 06:36.633
I JUST KINDA GOT IT
FOR--

06:36.667 --> 06:38.233
FOR CHERYL.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.233
YOU JUST BROUGHT SOME
ICE CREAM JUST FOR CHERYL?

06:40.267 --> 06:41.667
YOU DIDN'T BRING NONE
TO SHARE WITH US?

06:41.700 --> 06:44.167
WELL, SEE, HERE'S THE THING.
I'M NOT REALLY USED TO...

06:44.200 --> 06:46.467
THINKING ABOUT OTHER
PEOPLE OTHER THAN CHERYL.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.833
- OH.
- SO, IT'S NOT LIKE
I DID IT ON PURPOSE.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.233
- UH-HUH.
- THE THOUGHT JUST DIDN'T
EVEN ENTER MY MIND.

06:51.267 --> 06:53.767
IT'S NOT LIKE IT ENTERED
MY MIND AND I THOUGHT
"NO, THE HELL WITH THEM."

06:53.800 --> 06:56.700
SEE THE DIFFERENCE?
SIN OF COMISSION,
OMISSION.

06:56.733 --> 06:59.067
THAT'S A SIN OF OMISSION,
MUCH BETTER THAN
THE COMISSION.

06:59.067 --> 07:00.833
I THINK IT'S AN
OMISSION/COMISSION THING.

07:00.867 --> 07:02.200
BUT YOU STILL
FORGOT ABOUT US.

07:02.233 --> 07:04.967
SO NEXT TIME,
JUST BRING LIKE
THE FAMILY-ORDER SIZE...

07:05.067 --> 07:06.633
- I WILL.
- ...THAT THEY GOT THERE.

07:06.667 --> 07:08.433
- I WILL.
I'M SORRY, LORETTA.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

07:08.467 --> 07:10.133
- I FORGIVE YOU.
- THANK YOU.

07:10.167 --> 07:11.867
- HEY, CHERYL.
- HEY.

07:11.900 --> 07:14.100
HEY.
GOT YOU ICE CREAM!

07:14.133 --> 07:16.667
DID YOU JUST GET
IN A FIGHT WITH SOMEONE
AT THE ICE CREAM SHOP?

07:17.733 --> 07:18.933
UH... YEAH.

07:20.333 --> 07:21.467
YEAH, WELL,
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:23.067 --> 07:25.333
WELL, THIS WOMAN WAS
TAKING A LOT OF SAMPLES--

07:25.367 --> 07:27.067
- LET ME JUST TELL
LORETTA SOMETHING.
- YEAH.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.767
THIS WOMAN THAT
HE'S TALKING ABOUT

07:28.800 --> 07:31.800
IS THE DEAN OF ADMISSIONS
AT DRYDEN SCHOOL.

07:31.833 --> 07:33.733
Loretta:
THAT NICE SCHOOL WE WAS
TRYING TO GET THE KIDS IN?

07:33.767 --> 07:36.067
YEAH. NOW, THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH THEIR APPLICATION.

07:36.067 --> 07:37.133
BUT HOW DO YOU EVEN
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

07:37.167 --> 07:39.067
BECAUSE I JUST GOT
A PHONE CALL, LARRY.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.567
- OOH.
- LET ME JUST
SAY THIS, OKAY?

07:41.600 --> 07:43.467
THE WOMAN WAS STANDING
IN FRONT OF THE COUNTER

07:43.500 --> 07:46.333
GETTING SAMPLE AFTER SAMPLE.
SHE HAD 10 SAMPLES!

07:46.367 --> 07:48.500
- YOU'RE ALLOWED TO DO THAT.
- YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GET
FREE SAMPLES.

07:48.533 --> 07:50.067
- NO, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED--
- YES, YOU ARE.

07:50.067 --> 07:52.133
WHY YOU THINK THEY GET
THEM LITTLE, BITTY,
CUTE SPOONS THERE?

07:52.167 --> 07:54.500
- I KNOW WHY THEY GOT THEY
GOT THE CUTE SPOONS.
- SO YOU CAN TAKE--

07:54.533 --> 07:57.367
MAYBE ONE OR TWO.
DON'T ABUSE YOUR
SAMPLING PRIVILEGE!

07:57.400 --> 07:59.167
SHE ABUSED
THE SAMPLING PRIVILEGE.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.700
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
- WHAT?

08:00.733 --> 08:03.233
I WAS ALSO WATCHING OUT
FOR THE COUNTERWOMAN AS WELL.

08:03.267 --> 08:05.333
IF SHE HAD A PROBLEM
WITH THAT WOMAN,

08:05.367 --> 08:06.667
DON'T YOU THINK SHE WOULD SAY
"EXCUSE ME, MA'AM"?

08:06.700 --> 08:08.933
NO NO! 'CAUSE SHE'S ALWAYS
TOLD THE CUSTOMER'S RIGHT.

08:08.967 --> 08:12.633
AND IN FACT,
THE CUSTOMER IS USUALLY
A MORON AND AN ASSHOLE.

08:12.667 --> 08:15.167
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
LARRY? YOU SHOULD'VE MIND
YOUR BUSINESS ON THIS ONE.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.300
SHE WAS BREAKING THE RULES.
SHE WASN'T FOLLOWING
THE RULES OF SOCIETY.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.433
- WHAT RULES?
- THE UNWRITTEN RULES

08:20.467 --> 08:22.933
THAT WE HAVE AS WE
GO ABOUT OUR DAY!

08:22.967 --> 08:25.767
- LIKE WHAT?
- LIKE AT NIGHT,
YOU TIPTOE.

08:25.800 --> 08:29.767
THAT'S AN UNWRITTEN RULE.
YOU TIPTOE SO YOU DON'T
WAKE PEOPLE UP.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.267
YOU TIPTOE.
THERE'S NO SIGN,
"TIPTOE."

08:32.300 --> 08:34.367
YOU JUST HAVE
TO BE SMART ENOUGH

08:34.400 --> 08:35.967
AND CONSIDERATE
ENOUGH TO DO IT.

08:36.067 --> 08:38.967
OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE SO
PLEASED WITH YOURSELF

08:39.067 --> 08:41.167
BECAUSE NOW KEYSHA AND DARYL
ARE NOT GOING TO GET

08:41.200 --> 08:43.067
THE EDUCATION THAT
WE WERE HOPING THEY'D GET.

08:43.067 --> 08:44.433
THAT'S A REAL GOOD
SCHOOL, LARRY.

08:44.467 --> 08:46.700
AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON
THAT FOR SO LONG.

08:46.733 --> 08:49.067
- GOOD SCHOOL.
- COURTING THAT WOMAN.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.467
WHAT YOU GONNA DO, L.D.?

08:51.500 --> 08:54.333
I'LL GO AND--
I'LL GO APOLOGIZE.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.667
THAT-- THAT'S NICE.

08:56.700 --> 08:59.233
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
I'LL GET HER SOME FLOWERS TOO.

08:59.267 --> 09:00.933
THAT'S A GOOD START.
I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

09:00.967 --> 09:02.867
- THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
- YOU LIKE THE FLOWER IDEA?

09:02.900 --> 09:05.067
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
'CAUSE I WANT THEM
KIDS IN THAT SCHOOL.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.967
I'M-- I'M GONNA
RECTIFY IT.

09:07.067 --> 09:09.067
I'M A GREAT RECTIFIER.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

09:09.067 --> 09:11.867
I BREAK DOWN,
I RECTIFY.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.367
JUST SAY I'M SORRY,

09:13.400 --> 09:16.333
WE LOVE THE SCHOOL,
AND-- AND LEAVE.

09:16.367 --> 09:17.967
YOU-- YOU DON'T
NEED TO TELL ME

09:18.067 --> 09:19.867
HOW TO APOLOGIZE TO PEOPLE.

09:19.900 --> 09:22.400
I'VE BEEN APOLOGIZING TO PEOPLE
SINCE I'M SIX YEARS OLD

09:22.433 --> 09:25.267
ON A DAILY BASIS.
I PRETTY MUCH HAVE IT DOWN.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.900
- SO YOU GOT THIS?
- IS IT ALWAYS EFFECTIVE?

09:27.933 --> 09:30.100
- YOUR APOLOGIES?
- PRETTY EFFECTIVE.

09:30.133 --> 09:31.700
OKAY, GO.

09:31.733 --> 09:34.133
HEY HEY, HOW ABOUT
A THANK YOU? I BOUGHT
YOU SOME ICE CREAM.

09:34.167 --> 09:35.833
YEAH, ONE SCOOP
FOR THE WHOLE HOUSE.

09:35.867 --> 09:38.133
- THANK YOU, LARRY.
- I'M NICE!

09:38.167 --> 09:39.600
I GOT YOU THE ICE CREAM!

09:39.633 --> 09:41.367
THERE'S NO
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THAT?

09:41.400 --> 09:44.733
HEY, MR. DAVID,
I FINISHED UP ALL THE PAINTING.

09:44.767 --> 09:47.200
IT'S... WELL, 11:20 NOW,

09:47.233 --> 09:49.467
I GOT HERE AT 9:20, SO...

09:49.500 --> 09:51.567
THAT'S A COUPLE HOURS,
50 BUCKS.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.800
I'M HOPING YOU'RE
PLEASED WITH IT NOW.

09:53.833 --> 09:56.467
UMM, LET ME
ASK YOU A QUESTION.

09:56.500 --> 09:59.200
- MM-HMM?
- I MEAN, I REALLY
DON'T CARE ABOUT IT.

09:59.233 --> 10:01.967
IT DOESN'T MAKE
A DIFFERENCE TO ME EITHER
WAY, BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS

10:02.000 --> 10:05.667
BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN I LEFT
YOU WERE IN THE BATHROOM
FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.567
- NOW I CAME BACK AND YOU'RE
IN THE BATHROOM AGAIN.
- YEAH.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.500
SO I'M KINDA BE CHARGED
FOR WHAT, LIKE A HALF HOUR
OF YOUR TOILET TIME?

10:12.533 --> 10:13.833
OH, NO NO NO.

10:13.867 --> 10:15.967
IT'S JUST KIND OF
ALL-INCLUSIVE.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.933
YEAH, I DON'T REALLY
PUNCH A CLOCK, RIGHT?

10:17.967 --> 10:20.467
- YOU DON'T PUNCH
A CLOCK, DO YOU?
- I DON'T PUNCH A CLOCK.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.033
I DON'T CHARGE PEOPLE FOR
GOING ON THE TOILET, THOUGH.

10:23.067 --> 10:26.000
- ALL RIGHT, BUT THAT'S OKAY.
DOESN'T MATTER, EITHER WAY.
- GREAT, THANK YOU.

10:26.033 --> 10:27.500
- $50?
- I APPRECIATE THAT.

10:29.900 --> 10:32.033
- WHOA.
- THERE YOU GO.

10:32.067 --> 10:34.933
- WHAT'S THAT?
- IT'S $50.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.333
UH... YOU KNOW...

10:37.367 --> 10:39.167
YOU DON'T WANT IT?

10:39.200 --> 10:41.233
- NO, I WANT MONEY, BUT...
- TAKE IT.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.100
IT'S A GOOD 50!

10:44.133 --> 10:45.700
- ( sighs )
- YOU DON'T WANT IT?

10:45.733 --> 10:47.733
NO, I JUST DON'T
KNOW WHERE YOU DRAGGED
THAT THING OUT OF.

10:47.767 --> 10:49.867
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THAT'S...

10:49.900 --> 10:52.067
I-- I THINK-- DO YOU
HAVE ANY OTHER MONEY, OR...

10:53.700 --> 10:55.300
FINE.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.200
CHANGE...

10:59.233 --> 11:01.433
I GOT, UH...

11:01.467 --> 11:04.667
$45.90.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.967
- $45.90?
- YEAH.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.467
OR...

11:08.500 --> 11:10.700
I CAN GIVE YOU THE 50.

11:10.733 --> 11:11.967
( sighs )
NO.

11:12.067 --> 11:14.067
I'LL TAKE THE $45.90.

11:14.067 --> 11:16.300
THANK YOU.

11:21.100 --> 11:22.633
OKAY.

11:22.667 --> 11:23.800
I'M GONNA GET THESE.

11:23.833 --> 11:27.833
ALL RIGHT.
THOSE ARE 35.

11:27.867 --> 11:29.400
OKAY.

11:39.067 --> 11:40.700
NO.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.200
HEY, FUNKHOUSER.

11:45.233 --> 11:48.633
CALL ME BACK.
NO ONE'S TAKING THIS 50.
I CAN'T GET RID OF IT.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.533
I'LL BE HOME IN AN HOUR.

12:31.267 --> 12:33.167
Larry:
AS YOU KNOW, MY WIFE AND I

12:33.200 --> 12:36.267
TOOK IN A HOMELESS
FAMILY WHO WERE VICTIMS
OF HURRICANE EDNA.

12:36.300 --> 12:40.267
AND-- AND I WAS
SO ANXIOUS TO BRING
'EM THE ICE CREAM BACK

12:40.300 --> 12:44.667
THAT PERHAPS I WAS
A LITTLE TOO IMPATIENT
IN THE STORE WITH YOU.

12:44.700 --> 12:46.333
AND I-- I'M--

12:46.367 --> 12:48.633
COMPLETELY APOLOGIZE.
I'M SO SORRY, BUT...

12:48.667 --> 12:51.333
- I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT THOSE KIDS...
- RIGHT.

12:51.367 --> 12:54.067
...WAITING FOR THAT
ICE CREAM THAT THEY
HAVEN'T HAD IN MONTHS.

12:54.067 --> 12:56.100
AND WHEN I GOT HOME,
FINALLY, THEY SAID,

12:56.133 --> 12:58.533
- "OH, DADDY, WHAT TOOK"--
YOU KNOW THEY CALL ME DADDY.
- OH, REALLY?

12:58.567 --> 13:00.700
- YEAH, IT'S REALLY SWEET.
- THAT'S NICE.
THAT'S VERY NICE.

13:00.733 --> 13:02.100
I REALLY LOVE BEING
CALLED DADDY.

13:02.133 --> 13:04.233
I DON'T PARTICULARLY
LIKE CHILDREN,

13:04.267 --> 13:06.267
- THAT'S WHY I DON'T
REALLY HAVE ANY.
- UH-HUH.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.500
- BUT I LIKE
BEING CALLED DADDY.
- YES YES. I CAN SEE.

13:09.533 --> 13:12.333
IT'S-- I'VE NEVER
FELT ANYTHING LIKE THAT
BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

13:12.367 --> 13:14.400
"DADDY, DADDY!
YOU GOT THE ICE CREAM!"

13:14.433 --> 13:16.267
- UH-HUH.
- "WHAT TOOK SO LONG, DADDY?"

13:16.300 --> 13:18.367
AND I SAID,
"WELL, YOU KNOW,

13:18.400 --> 13:20.967
I HAD A LITTLE INCIDENT
AT THE ICE CREAM STORE.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.067
BUT ANYWAY, I'D LOVE FOR YOU
TO HAVE THESE FLOWERS

13:24.100 --> 13:27.733
AND ACCEPT MY HEARTFELT
AND HUMBLE APOLOGY.

13:27.767 --> 13:29.333
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

13:29.367 --> 13:31.167
- ( sniffs ) MMM!
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

13:31.200 --> 13:34.867
- OH, THEY SMELL WONDERFUL.
- AREN'T THEY BEAUTIFUL?

13:34.900 --> 13:37.667
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST SUCH A RARE THING
FOR SOMEONE TO COME IN

13:37.700 --> 13:39.700
AND JUST ADMIT
RIGHT OFF THE TOP,

13:39.733 --> 13:42.100
I WAS AT FAULT.
IT WAS ME, I WAS RUDE.

13:42.133 --> 13:44.467
I WAS OBNOXIOUS,
I'M NOT SUCH A GREAT PERSON.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.267
IT'S JUST REALLY REFRESHING.
IT'S REALLY RARE.

13:47.300 --> 13:49.600
SAYING ALL THAT,
I AM A PRETTY GOOD PERSON.

13:49.633 --> 13:51.700
- I DID TAKE IN
A HOMELESS FAMILY.
- YES.

13:51.733 --> 13:53.500
EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT.
KELLY!

13:53.533 --> 13:56.200
COULD YOU
COME IN FOR A SEC?

13:56.233 --> 13:58.067
- ANYWAY--
- WELL, HOLD ON.

13:58.067 --> 13:59.833
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A VASE FOR THIS.

13:59.867 --> 14:02.533
- OOH, OOH!
FABRIC SAMPLES!
- FABRIC SAMPLES.

14:02.567 --> 14:05.500
FABRIC SAMPLES.
THEY'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

14:05.533 --> 14:08.067
- MMM.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THE FABRICS?

14:08.067 --> 14:10.067
- OH, I'M GONNA
REDO THIS COUCH.
- OH.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.867
IS THIS THE ONE I CHOSE?

14:11.900 --> 14:15.133
UH, NO, ACTUALLY.
WASN'T THAT THE ONE
THAT YOU WANTED?

14:15.167 --> 14:17.267
OH, YES, BUT NOW
I WANT THIS.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.100
YEAH, SHE-- SHE
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

14:19.133 --> 14:21.900
- NO, I DON'T.
- YEAH, YOU REALLY
LIKED THE RED TONES.

14:21.933 --> 14:24.067
I KNOW.
I KNOW, I DID.

14:24.067 --> 14:26.300
- I LIKE THE ONE YOU CHOSE.
- THE ONE I CHOSE--

14:26.333 --> 14:28.833
- I'LL...
- YEAH, I WILL SEE YOU
TOMORROW THEN, I GUESS.

14:28.867 --> 14:31.367
- I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
FOR OUR INTERVIEW.
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.067
OH, GOD, SEE,
THERE'S THIS KIND OF
TURQUOISE COLOR IN HERE.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.400
- IT'S JUST--
- THEY'RE ALL NICE.

14:35.433 --> 14:37.367
- THEY'RE LOVELY.
- YES, THEY ARE.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.400
THEY ARE ALL NICE,
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

14:39.433 --> 14:42.067
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT YOU
NEED TO DO, YOU NEED
TO PICK ONE, SEE?

14:42.067 --> 14:44.167
IF ONLY IT WERE
THAT SIMPLE.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.933
- YEAH.
IT IS THAT SIMPLE, REALLY.
- YEAH, BUT SEE THE BLUE?

14:46.967 --> 14:48.767
YOU WANT THEM ALL,
YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM ALL.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.900
- I WANT THEM ALL.
- YOU GOT TO KINDA TAKE ONE.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.767
- I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.200
- OH, GOD, WHAT DO I DO?
- TAKE IT, PICK IT OUT.

14:56.367 --> 14:58.733
YOU STILL WANT ME
TO TAKE THIS ONE.

15:27.433 --> 15:29.133
Larry:
I'M HOME!

15:29.167 --> 15:32.767
ONE FOR YOU
AND ONE FOR YOU.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.867
WHAT?
L.D., THIS IS NICE.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.600
MY TWO FAVORITE GIRLS.
COME ON, GIVE IT UP.

15:37.633 --> 15:39.900
AW!

15:39.933 --> 15:42.067
- SO IT WENT WELL?
- I BROKE IT DOWN...

15:42.100 --> 15:44.833
- AND I RECTIFIED.
- YOU RECTIFIED?

15:44.867 --> 15:46.200
- SEE THIS HAND?
- UH-HUH.

15:46.233 --> 15:48.567
THAT'S WHERE SHE
JUST HAD SOME LUNCH.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.900
- THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.
- SO THE APPLICATION IS OKAY

15:50.933 --> 15:54.533
- AND EVERYTHING'S
BACK ON TRACK?
- IT'S SO ON TRACK.

15:54.567 --> 15:56.900
- SO ON TRACK.
- YOU COULDN'T SHAKE
THAT TRAIN OFF.

15:56.933 --> 15:58.467
- THE KIDS ARE GONNA
APPRECIATE THAT.
- LARRY.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.700
THESE ARE REAL NICE, L.D.

16:00.733 --> 16:02.633
THAT IS SO SWEET.
THANK YOU.

16:02.667 --> 16:04.600
- I'M GONNA PUT THESE
IN SOME WATER.
- OKAY.

16:04.633 --> 16:06.233
ALL RIGHT.

16:06.267 --> 16:08.067
PUT 'EM IN--
PUT 'EM IN SOMETHING

16:08.067 --> 16:09.667
- AND THEN, YOU KNOW.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:09.700 --> 16:11.700
- COME ON UPSTAIRS.
- GO UPSTAIRS?

16:11.733 --> 16:13.333
- COME ON.
- LET ME PUT IT
IN SOME WATER.

16:13.367 --> 16:14.867
( doorbell rings )

16:14.900 --> 16:17.233
YEAH, THAT CAN WAIT
JUST ONE SECOND.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.267
HEY!

16:26.767 --> 16:29.800
WHY DID YOU LEAVE
THAT STUPID MESSAGE
ON MY ANSWERING MACHINE?

16:29.833 --> 16:32.200
- WHAT?
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT THE MONEY ANYMORE.

16:32.233 --> 16:34.133
NO ONE WILL TAKE THIS MONEY.
I COULDN'T GIVE IT TO A BUM.

16:34.167 --> 16:37.367
LISTEN TO ME.
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE MONEY.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.367
SOMEONE STOLE FLOWERS

16:40.400 --> 16:43.333
THAT WERE MARKING
THE SPOT WHERE MY MOTHER
WAS HIT IN HER WHEELCHAIR.

16:45.433 --> 16:46.967
- REALLY?
- YES.

16:47.067 --> 16:50.067
I'M NOT A VIOLENT PERSON.
BUT IF I FIND THIS GUY,

16:50.067 --> 16:51.467
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M
GONNA DO TO HIM.

16:55.067 --> 16:59.067
- HMM.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT A HUMAN
BEING WOULD DO THAT.

16:59.100 --> 17:01.500
HOW WOULD YOU EVEN KNOW
THE FLOWERS ARE MISSING?

17:01.533 --> 17:03.900
I KEEP TRACK OF IT.
I DRIVE BY THERE
10 TIMES A DAY.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.500
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU SHOULD GO HOME NOW.

17:08.533 --> 17:11.400
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE 50.
I DON'T EVEN CARE
ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

17:11.433 --> 17:13.567
- YOU KNOW--
- ( sniffs )

17:13.600 --> 17:15.700
WHAT IS THAT I SMELL?
( sniffs )

17:15.733 --> 17:17.133
WHAT? THERE'S NO SMELL.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:17.167 --> 17:18.933
THAT'S A WHITE LILY.

17:18.967 --> 17:21.067
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT-- WHAT--
A WHITE LILY?

17:21.067 --> 17:22.567
I KNOW A WHITE LILY.
( sniffing )

17:22.600 --> 17:24.633
- HUH?
- I'VE GOT A GOOD
SENSE OF SMELL.

17:24.667 --> 17:26.933
- ( sniffing )
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:26.967 --> 17:28.533
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- ( sniffing )

17:31.200 --> 17:33.367
THERE THEY ARE.
I KNEW IT!

17:33.400 --> 17:35.333
- HI, MARTY.
- HI, HOW ARE YOU, CHERYL?

17:35.367 --> 17:37.667
- BOY, THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL.
- THANK YOU.

17:37.700 --> 17:40.467
- WHERE'D YOU GET 'EM?
- LARRY JUST BROUGHT 'EM
HOME FOR ME.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.567
WHERE'D YOU
GET THE FLOWERS?

17:44.700 --> 17:46.200
UM... WHERE'D I GET THOSE?

17:46.233 --> 17:49.133
- OH, VENTURA BOULEVARD.
- WHAT STORE?

17:49.167 --> 17:50.500
( clicks teeth )
WHAT WAS IT?

17:50.533 --> 17:52.067
UH...

17:53.067 --> 17:54.567
WHERE CAN I FIND A VASE?

17:57.067 --> 17:59.567
DID YOU TAKE THE FLOWERS
AT MY MOTHER'S SITE?

17:59.600 --> 18:01.167
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

18:01.200 --> 18:04.167
THEY WOULDN'T TAKE THE 50
AT THE FLOWER STORE!

18:04.200 --> 18:05.500
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?!
- OH, GOD.

18:05.533 --> 18:06.933
WHY? THERE ARE
SO MANY OF THEM.

18:06.967 --> 18:08.800
- I DIDN'T KNOW IT
WAS SUCH A BIG--
- SO MANY OF THEM?!

18:08.833 --> 18:11.100
- IS THAT SUCH A BAD THING?
- THEY'RE NOT THERE TO PICK!

18:11.133 --> 18:13.500
- YOU ARE THE LOWEST OF THE LOW.
- I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU.

18:13.533 --> 18:15.467
I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING
LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.500
- HOW MANY FLOWERS
DOES SHE NEED?
- YOU TOOK FLOWERS

18:17.533 --> 18:20.333
- FROM MARTY'S MOTHER?
- ARE THESE FROM A GRAVEYARD?

18:20.367 --> 18:22.633
NOT A GRAVEYARD.
IT'S A ROADSIDE MEMORIAL.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.067
IT'S NOT SUCH A-- COME ON!

18:24.100 --> 18:26.133
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:26.167 --> 18:29.733
I AM MISSING ONE!
WHERE'S THE THIRD BUNCH?

18:30.933 --> 18:32.533
- I-I--
- THERE WERE THREE BOUQUETS.

18:32.567 --> 18:36.067
- I KNOW WHERE IT IS.
- HE WILL GET YOU THAT BOUQUET.

18:36.067 --> 18:38.167
I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.433
IF YOU WEREN'T
MY BEST FRIEND,

18:41.467 --> 18:43.100
I WOULD TAKE MY BARE HANDS

18:43.133 --> 18:45.067
AND POP YOUR HEAD
OFF YOUR NECK.

18:46.300 --> 18:49.300
( scoffs )
HE'S NOT MY BEST FRIEND.

18:49.333 --> 18:52.133
YOU BETTER
GET THOSE FLOWERS!

18:52.167 --> 18:54.767
( door opens, slams )

18:54.800 --> 18:56.667
QUICK QUESTION--

18:56.700 --> 18:59.800
IS THE OTHER BOUQUET
IN THE DEAN'S OFFICE?

18:59.833 --> 19:01.567
MMM... WELL...
( laughs )

19:02.633 --> 19:04.167
YEAH.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.900
THAT'S GREAT.

19:05.933 --> 19:08.400
- I'M GONNA GO GET IT.
- YEAH. THAT'S GOOD.

19:08.433 --> 19:10.400
AND THEN AFTER
I GET 'EM BACK...

19:11.767 --> 19:15.267
- ANYTHING I CAN DO TO...
- GET BACK UPSTAIRS?

19:15.300 --> 19:17.433
YEAH.

19:17.467 --> 19:18.933
UMMM...

19:18.967 --> 19:22.100
I DO LIKE THAT
PERFUME BELLE FILLE.

19:22.133 --> 19:24.433
- BELLE FILLE.
- THAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY.

19:24.467 --> 19:27.633
- I KNOW WHERE IT IS.
ON WILSHIRE BLVD, RIGHT?
- YES.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.467
- THAT STORE ON--
- THAT'S ONLY PLACE
THAT SELLS IT.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.733
YES! BELLE FILLE.

19:31.767 --> 19:34.067
YOU-- YOU GOT IT.

20:27.300 --> 20:28.933
- CAN I JUST ADD TO IT PLEASE?
- SURE.

20:28.967 --> 20:31.100
- THANKS.
- OH.

20:31.133 --> 20:34.233
WAIT WAIT WAIT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I REALLY LIKE THAT TOO.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.433
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR?

20:35.467 --> 20:38.467
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT,
BUT THESE ARE WONDERFUL.

20:38.500 --> 20:41.200
TRY THAT ONE.
THAT ONE'S AMAZING.

20:41.233 --> 20:42.800
SO IT'S ALL
SORT OF A NEW LINE?

20:42.833 --> 20:44.000
YEAH, THOSE AND WE'VE
GOT DIFFERENT ONES.

20:44.033 --> 20:46.467
THESE ARE TWO CITRUS,
THAT ONE'S-- I KNOW.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.200
- I LOVE THAT.
- SO GOOD, RIGHT?

20:48.233 --> 20:51.333
BUY IT. BUY IT.
IT'S A GOOD ONE.

20:51.367 --> 20:53.933
- GET THAT ONE.
- THIS IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE
PEPPERED WITH CINNAMON.

20:53.967 --> 20:55.867
- UH-HUH.
- IT'S GOOD.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.467
GOOD, BUY IT.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.733
UM, I WAS LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING ACTUALLY ALSO

21:01.767 --> 21:03.967
WHICH IS VERY MUCH
LIKE THAT.

21:04.067 --> 21:05.967
- ACTUALLY, I HAVE
THIS ONE AT HOME.
- DO YOU REALLY?

21:06.067 --> 21:07.167
IT'S GOOD.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.967
- CAN'T REALLY SAMPLE.
- ROSE, NOT A BIG FAN.

21:10.067 --> 21:12.767
YOU KNOW? YOU CAN'T SAMPLE
EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.133
IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE.
WE'D ALL LIKE TO TRY
EVERYTHING.

21:15.167 --> 21:16.600
EVEN THOUGH I'D LOVE TO,
JUST CAN'T.

21:16.633 --> 21:19.967
THERE'S PEOPLE IN LINE,
PEOPLE GOT TO GO PLACES.

21:20.067 --> 21:22.333
I GO TO A RESTAURANT, CAN I
GET EVERYTHING ON THE MENU?

21:22.367 --> 21:24.233
I'D LOVE TO.
WHO DOESN'T WANT
EVERYTHING ON THE MENU?

21:24.267 --> 21:26.500
YOU CAN'T, YOU GOT
TO ORDER ONE THING.
THAT'S ALL.

21:26.533 --> 21:28.933
I'M DONE.
I'M GONNA TAKE THAT.

21:28.967 --> 21:30.700
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

21:32.100 --> 21:33.900
THE SAMPLING THING
HAS GOT TO, YOU KNOW,

21:33.933 --> 21:35.733
WE GOT TO PUT AN END
TO IT, YOU KNOW?

21:35.767 --> 21:37.167
I'D LIKE TO BE
WITH A LOT OF WOMEN,

21:37.200 --> 21:40.233
I CAN'T SAMPLE EVERY WOMAN.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

21:40.267 --> 21:42.600
- WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU?
- YEAH, BELLE FILLE.

21:42.633 --> 21:44.633
IT'S THAT ONE.

21:46.067 --> 21:48.633
- HERE YOU ARE.
- YOU GOT IT, THAT'S GREAT.

21:48.667 --> 21:50.300
SORRY, I THINK
THAT'S THE LAST ONE.

21:51.633 --> 21:54.533
I WAS ON LINE AHEAD OF HIM.
I WAS AHEAD OF HIM.

21:54.567 --> 21:56.333
YEAH, WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE CHANGED LINES.

21:59.733 --> 22:01.533
CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING ELSE?

22:01.567 --> 22:03.500
NO, I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE.
YOU HAVE A LINE PROBLEM
IN THIS STORE.

22:03.533 --> 22:05.667
THE LINES MOVE COMPLETELY
DISPROPORTIONATELY.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.600
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
A WAY TO FIX THAT TOO.

22:07.633 --> 22:10.333
LIKE THEY DO IN DISNEYLAND,
YOU KNOW, HOW THE LINE
SNAKES AROUND.

22:10.367 --> 22:13.067
GO INTO A DELI,
YOU TAKE A NUMBER.

22:13.067 --> 22:14.500
SO IT'S FAIR, THAT'S ALL.

22:14.533 --> 22:17.767
'CAUSE YOU PROBABLY DON'T
ADD UP STUFF AT THE SAME RATE.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.067
THERE'S A WAY
TO SOLVE IT-- ONE LINE.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.333
IT'S NOT A CRAZY IDEA.

22:21.367 --> 22:23.900
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE STONED ME
BACK 1000 YEARS AGO

22:23.933 --> 22:25.467
FOR BRINGING UP
THE ONE-LINE IDEA.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.667
THERE'S ONE LINE,
EVERYBODY FEELS GOOD.

22:27.700 --> 22:30.067
THEY DON'T FEEL
THEY'RE BEING CHEATED.

22:30.067 --> 22:32.167
YOU HAVE A ROPE,
YOU ROPE IT OFF,

22:32.200 --> 22:33.933
AND PEOPLE MOVE UP
FAIR AND SQUARE.

22:33.967 --> 22:36.367
NOBODY'S GOING
"OH OH, I CAN'T MOVE."

22:36.400 --> 22:38.067
YOU KNOW,
LOOK AT THEM, LOOK AT ME.

22:38.067 --> 22:39.700
THAT'S ALL, ONE LINE.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.567
ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.833
SO SAMMY WOULD
BE IN SEVENTH?

22:48.867 --> 22:51.300
CORRECT, YES.
AND SHE'S HAVING HER
BAT MITZVAH THIS YEAR.

22:51.333 --> 22:52.833
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.
- YES, SHE'LL BE 13.

22:52.867 --> 22:54.367
HOW IS THAT GOING?
IS SHE ENJOYING IT?

22:54.400 --> 22:56.367
Susie: I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

22:56.400 --> 22:58.500
THE WAY SHE'S
LEARNING HER HAPHTARAH...

22:58.533 --> 23:02.067
BECAUSE SHE'S
ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDING.

23:02.100 --> 23:05.967
- THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.
- AND IT'S PROVING INTERESTING.

23:06.067 --> 23:08.167
...AND UNDERSTANDING
THE MEANING OF
WHAT SHE'S SAYING,

23:08.200 --> 23:09.800
WHICH IS SO
IMPORTANT TO ME.

23:09.833 --> 23:11.833
- OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
- YEAH.

23:11.867 --> 23:14.100
THAT'S LOVELY.

23:14.133 --> 23:17.900
- I THINK THESE TRADITIONS
ARE VERY IMPORTANT.
- Susie: YES, IT IS IMPORTANT.

23:17.933 --> 23:20.800
- IT'S A RITE OF PASSAGE.
- YES, EXACTLY.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.467
AND HOBBIES--
DOES SHE HAVE ANY?

23:28.900 --> 23:30.567
( chattering )

23:42.533 --> 23:44.100
- HEY, HI.
- Susie: HELLO.

23:44.133 --> 23:46.233
- Jeff: HEY.
- MR. DAVID.

23:46.267 --> 23:48.833
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- OH NOTHING, I WAS JUST...

23:48.867 --> 23:51.300
DRIVING BY THE BUILDING.
I KNEW YOU GUYS WERE
HERE FOR YOUR INTERVIEW.

23:51.333 --> 23:53.367
I THOUGHT WE'D GO OUT,
HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE,
DISCUSS THE INTERVIEW.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.400
'CAUSE OUR KIDS
COULD BE GOING TOGETHER.

23:55.433 --> 23:56.833
- OUR KIDS COULD BE
GOING TOGETHER.
- Jeff: YEAH.

23:56.867 --> 24:00.467
- HE WAS HERE EARLIER TODAY.
- REALLY, WHY?

24:00.500 --> 24:02.733
TO APOLOGIZE TO ME

24:02.767 --> 24:05.133
FOR BEING RUDE,
OBNOXIOUS AND UNCIVIL
IN THE ICE CREAM STORE.

24:05.167 --> 24:07.967
SHE WAS TAKING A LOT OF
TIME IN THE ICE CREAM
STORE SAMPLING...

24:08.067 --> 24:10.333
BUT HE BROUGHT ME
A LOVELY BOUQUET
OF FLOWERS IN APOLOGY.

24:10.367 --> 24:12.533
- THEY'RE RIGHT...
- Susie: UH-HUH.

24:12.567 --> 24:15.133
Dean:
KELLY, WHERE ARE
THE FLOWERS?

24:15.167 --> 24:17.067
THEY WERE JUST THERE.

24:17.067 --> 24:18.300
I JUST PUT 'EM RIGHT THERE.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.967
WELL, WHERE DID THEY GO?

24:25.500 --> 24:27.933
THIS IS FUCKING
GREAT, LARRY!

24:27.967 --> 24:29.933
NOW SAMMY'S
KICKED OUT TOO.

24:29.967 --> 24:32.067
JUST KNOWING YOU
IS A LIABILITY.

24:32.100 --> 24:34.467
WE WERE IN THERE, WE'RE HAVING
THE INTERVIEW, IT'S NICE.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.267
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
GOING TO ACCEPT HER.
AND THEN YOU SHOW UP!

24:37.300 --> 24:38.533
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

24:38.567 --> 24:40.633
I'M REAL--
I'M-- I'M SORRY.

24:40.667 --> 24:44.233
YOU KNOW, THESE ARE
CHILDREN'S LIVES WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT, LARRY.

24:44.267 --> 24:46.133
THEIR FUTURE
IS IN OUR HANDS.

24:46.167 --> 24:48.233
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
YOU JUST BECAME A PARENT.

24:48.267 --> 24:50.333
- BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY.
- I-I BELIEVE--

24:50.367 --> 24:52.867
- I BELIEVE THE CHILDREN
ARE OUR FUTURE.
- Jeff: OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:52.900 --> 24:55.233
YOU HAVE RUINED MY LIFE!
YOU HAVE RUINED MY LIFE!

24:55.267 --> 24:57.900
- I HAVE TO LIVE WITH THIS NOW!
- OH, YOU BET HE DOES!

24:57.933 --> 25:00.600
OH, DO YOU HEAR THAT?
I AM FUCKED!

25:00.633 --> 25:03.167
AND YOU FUCKED ME!
HARD!

25:03.200 --> 25:04.667
SHE'LL GET INTO
ANOTHER SCHOOL.

25:04.700 --> 25:06.133
WE DON'T WANT ANOTHER SCHOOL.
WE WANT THIS SCHOOL!

25:06.167 --> 25:08.367
WE DID ALL OUR RESEARCH
FOR THIS SCHOOL, MAN.

25:11.467 --> 25:13.300
CAN I HAVE THOSE FLOWERS?

25:13.333 --> 25:14.967
YOU WANT THE FLOWERS?

25:15.067 --> 25:16.933
- TAKE THE FUCKING FLOWERS!
- ( screaming )

25:40.500 --> 25:43.167
IS THAT WHAT THIS
LOOKED LIKE WHEN
YOU STOLE IT?

25:43.200 --> 25:45.067
WHAT?
PROBLEM?

25:45.067 --> 25:46.667
YEAH, A BIG PROBLEM.

25:46.700 --> 25:48.333
- ( crowd chattering )
- NO GOOD?

25:48.367 --> 25:51.400
- NO GOOD, NO.
- WELL, THAT'S-- THAT'S
THE WAY I GOT 'EM.

25:51.433 --> 25:53.500
COME ON, WHAT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

25:53.533 --> 25:56.167
THEY SHOULD ALL STAND UP.
THAT'S WHAT FLOWERS DO
WHEN THEY'RE HEALTHY.

25:57.867 --> 25:59.667
- RIGHT.
- STOP PICKING UP
THE PETALS, OKAY?

25:59.700 --> 26:01.367
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
A MESS IN YOUR HOUSE.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.200
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
YOU MADE ENOUGH OF A MESS.

26:03.233 --> 26:04.833
- OKAY, I'M-- I'M SORRY.
- OKAY?

26:04.867 --> 26:06.633
- OKAY.
- WHO ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE?

26:06.667 --> 26:08.800
THEY'RE FRIENDS
AND RELATIVES
FROM OUT OF TOWN.

26:08.833 --> 26:11.267
THEY CAME IN
FOR TOMORROW'S FUNERAL.

26:11.300 --> 26:12.833
- IS THAT LEWIS?
- YEAH.

26:12.867 --> 26:14.333
HEY!

26:14.367 --> 26:16.533
HEY.

26:16.567 --> 26:18.867
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

26:18.900 --> 26:21.067
I JUST-- I JUST CAME HERE
TO PAY MY RESPECTS

26:21.067 --> 26:23.333
BECAUSE I-- I CAN'T
GO TO THE FUNERAL.

26:23.367 --> 26:26.267
Larry:
GOD, LOOK AT THESE VULTURES
GOING FOR THAT FOOD!

26:26.300 --> 26:28.433
Lewis:
THESE-- THESE PEOPLE,
THEY DON'T EVEN CHEW.

26:28.467 --> 26:31.433
YOU KNOW, I BET IF YOU
THREW A QUARTER DOWN,
THERE'D BE A STAMPEDE.

26:31.467 --> 26:34.067
YOU KNOW THAT?
THIS-- I GOT TO--

26:34.067 --> 26:35.600
I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

26:35.633 --> 26:38.333
I GOT THE WILLIES
FROM THIS WHOLE--
THIS WHOLE PLACE, MAN.

26:38.367 --> 26:41.400
- WHAT-- WHAT IS THAT?
- THAT'S HIS MOTHER'S SHRINE.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.600
THAT'S WHERE MARTY
PUT ALL THE THINGS
SHE CHERISHED IN LIFE--

26:44.633 --> 26:47.567
HE GATHERED LIKE SOME PSYCHO
AND PUT IT ON THE TABLE.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.733
I-- I GOT TO GO.

26:59.767 --> 27:01.600
CHERYL, I'M HOME!

27:01.633 --> 27:03.467
- LOOK WHAT I DREW.
- YEAH, OKAY, YEAH.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.100
- HEY, LARRY!
- YEAH, GET AWAY.

27:05.133 --> 27:06.467
YEAH.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.367
I GOT THE PERFUME!

27:13.967 --> 27:16.067
- YOU SMELL GOOD.
- THANK YOU.

27:16.067 --> 27:18.267
HEY, YOU WANT TO GO TO MY
SISTER'S AFTER THE SERVICE?

27:18.300 --> 27:20.100
I DON'T THINK SO.

27:20.133 --> 27:22.067
( somber organ music
playing )

27:22.067 --> 27:24.367
( crowd murmuring )

27:24.400 --> 27:26.467
- Marty: THANKS FOR COMING.
- Jeff: SURE.

27:30.100 --> 27:31.800
SORRY, MAN.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.467
HEY, THANKS SO MUCH
FOR COMING, APPRECIATE IT.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.933
( sniffing )

27:53.300 --> 27:55.467
- DO YOU SMELL SOMETHING?
- ( sniffing )

27:56.767 --> 27:59.500
YES, WHAT IS THAT?

27:59.533 --> 28:01.533
THAT'S MOM'S PERFUME.

28:01.567 --> 28:05.067
YOU'RE RIGHT.
( sniffing )

28:10.100 --> 28:12.500
IT'S SO STRONG.

28:12.533 --> 28:14.767
- IT'S LIKE SHE'S
HERE WITH US.
- ( sniffing )

28:38.233 --> 28:39.967
HEY, SOMEBODY
DROPPED A 50!

28:40.067 --> 28:41.400
( woman gasps )

28:41.433 --> 28:43.567
( all chattering, shouting )

28:49.300 --> 28:51.633
( theme music playing )
