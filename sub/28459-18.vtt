I apologize.

I love you like that.

- Yeah.

09:15.500 --> 09:18.166
- Hi, Denise!
- Hi!

09:18.200 --> 09:20.266
- Oh, how are you, Denise?

09:20.300 --> 09:22.200
- We still can't get
even updates

09:22.233 --> 09:24.533
on any of the areas
evacuated.

09:24.567 --> 09:25.767
It's really strange.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.500
- Is it contained at all?
Any--at all?

09:28.533 --> 09:30.700
- No, they said there was
zero containment.

09:30.734 --> 09:33.533
- Zero?
Still zero?

09:33.567 --> 09:35.066
- What a nightmare.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.066

about--about your house?

09:37.100 --> 09:38.567

what to do

except get out.

my house is okay.

was insane.

a mass evacuation like that.

10:16.133 --> 10:17.734
And the police drive up
the block

10:17.767 --> 10:20.200
and say mandatory evacuation.

10:20.233 --> 10:23.100
So I ran out and I say, "David,
we have to evacuate the house."

10:23.133 --> 10:25.100
So I went into my safe,

10:25.133 --> 10:27.734

that I needed,

10:27.767 --> 10:29.133

painting.

10:32.233 --> 10:34.300
And we caravanned
down the street.

have been just misplaced.

to know that they are safe.

we can do.

34:16.300 --> 34:18.199
- Cruz is such a rock star.

34:18.233 --> 34:20.533
- Cruz, because honestly--
- Can I be honest with you?

34:20.567 --> 34:22.632
He looks so much like
your dad to me.

34:22.667 --> 34:24.433
- He's like a combination
of my--

34:24.467 --> 34:26.400
well, I think my dad and Edwin

34:26.433 --> 34:28.367
actually look
a little bit alike.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.266
- We always go after our dads!

34:31.300 --> 34:33.367
Harry and my dad look
just, like, alike.

34:33.400 --> 34:34.699
- I wouldn't know.
- Really?

34:34.734 --> 34:36.600
- You have to go find, like,
the hottest Latin.

34:36.632 --> 34:38.667
And then shack up with that one

34:38.699 --> 34:40.433
- Your dad's Hispanic?
- Really?

34:40.467 --> 34:42.233
- Yeah.
- I didn't know that.

34:42.266 --> 34:43.567
- I was born and raised in
El Salvador, honey.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.734
- Oh, that's right.
- I didn't realize that.

34:45.766 --> 34:47.400
- My grandmother is, like,
a Mayan-Indian woman.

34:47.433 --> 34:49.266
We're Latins, babe.

34:49.300 --> 34:50.567
- I had no idea!

34:50.600 --> 34:52.667
- Yeah, I'm half.
No, my father's half.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.567
I'm a quarter.
A quarter.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.766
My father being raised
in El Salvador

34:57.000 --> 34:58.400
doesn't mean anything,

34:58.433 --> 35:01.333
because I never meant
anything to them.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.700
So it's simply--it's just
part of my heritage.

35:03.734 --> 35:06.000
- Okay, let's order, guys.
We're going to order.

35:06.033 --> 35:07.533
- Okay, this is the menu.

35:07.567 --> 35:09.367
You have the starts and mains.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.300
- There's this butternut soup
with chestnut caramel.

35:11.333 --> 35:14.667
So I'm gonna have the butternut
and pasta, my fat ass.

35:14.700 --> 35:16.700
- Can I have, um,
a bur--the burger?

35:16.734 --> 35:18.467
- Yeah, medium?
- Well done, please.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.734
- Salad and the fish, please.

35:20.767 --> 35:22.233
- And for you, Madame?

35:22.266 --> 35:24.333
- Burger, well done, please.

35:24.367 --> 35:25.633
- We're in France.

35:25.667 --> 35:28.233
Isn't there anything
other than a burger

35:28.266 --> 35:30.400
that you can choose
on this menu?

35:30.433 --> 35:32.000
Well, they're American.

35:32.033 --> 35:34.000
Americans need to
kind of, like--

35:34.033 --> 35:35.767
- You're an American!
What are you talking about?

35:36.000 --> 35:37.700
You're born in Connecticut!

35:37.734 --> 35:40.567
- I totally get it.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.333
- Oh, my gosh.
This is delicious.

35:43.367 --> 35:45.467
- So last night you said...
- Yes.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.233
- That you and Kim
had a conversation

35:47.266 --> 35:48.567
and you were gonna
tell us about

35:48.600 --> 35:50.000
how you took over Erika Jayne

35:50.033 --> 35:51.033
and how you would
not break character.

35:51.066 --> 35:52.600
- All right.

35:52.633 --> 35:54.233
- As an actor, I really commit
to what I'm doing.

35:54.266 --> 35:55.600
Anyway, it was really fun.

35:55.633 --> 35:57.000
- No, I know.
It was actually very weird.

35:57.033 --> 35:59.000
[chuckles]

35:59.033 --> 36:00.734
- Because I was playing
a character of Erika Jayne,

36:00.767 --> 36:04.300
it helped me
face your sister.

36:04.333 --> 36:07.367
I couldn't have faced
your sister being Lisa Rinna.

36:07.400 --> 36:10.400
- It seems to me like
Lisa Rinna was using

36:10.433 --> 36:15.367
her arrogant persona to call
my sister C-U-N-T-Y.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.266
Why not take responsibility
for your own words?

36:18.300 --> 36:19.767
I mean, you're the queen
of owning it!

36:20.000 --> 36:22.367
- I didn't ever plan that
that would happen.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.033
That, like,
flew out of my mouth.

36:24.066 --> 36:25.767
I was, like, (BLEEP), Rinna!
What are you doing?

36:26.000 --> 36:30.533
It happened and what it led
to was Kim and I sitting down

36:30.567 --> 36:33.433
and having the conversation
to move on

36:33.467 --> 36:34.633
and move forward.

36:34.667 --> 36:37.667
- Let's just forgive
each other.

36:37.700 --> 36:39.633
- Okay.

36:39.667 --> 36:41.367
Wow.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.500
- Miracles happen.
See, you never know.

36:43.533 --> 36:45.467
- Could you have said it
as Lisa Rinna?

36:45.500 --> 36:47.567
- No.
- No?

36:47.600 --> 36:49.700
- Why do you think as actors
we like to act?

36:49.734 --> 36:51.133
I (BLEEP) up.

36:51.166 --> 36:53.000
I don't always do
the right thing.

36:53.033 --> 36:56.667
But I will say to you,
even though that happened,

36:56.700 --> 36:58.400
I'm so grateful,

36:58.433 --> 37:00.033
because there was a big,
fat elephant in the room

37:00.066 --> 37:01.667
that was not being addressed.

37:01.700 --> 37:03.333
- But the fact that you did it
as Erika Jayne

37:03.367 --> 37:04.667
was the part that made us all,
like, what?

37:04.700 --> 37:06.533
- It jarred me because
two reasons:

37:06.567 --> 37:09.433
A, it seemed inappropriate
in the moment.

37:09.467 --> 37:10.734
B, and I thought to myself,

37:10.767 --> 37:14.033
Erika Jayne, Erika Girardi,
our friend Erika,

37:14.066 --> 37:16.400
who's one human being, no
matter what you guys wanna say,

37:16.433 --> 37:18.000
wouldn't talk like that
to any of us.

37:18.033 --> 37:19.533
- Have you watched Erika Jayne?

37:19.567 --> 37:21.333
- It says (BLEEP).

37:21.367 --> 37:24.500
- That word really bothers me.
I'm not gonna lie.

37:24.533 --> 37:26.533
- This means sassy,
it means sexy,

37:26.567 --> 37:28.000
it means fun.

37:28.033 --> 37:29.600
And you can't
get offended by it.

37:29.633 --> 37:32.700
- Yeah, but I've never seen
Erika Jayne do that.

37:32.734 --> 37:34.633
- That's my interpretation
of her, though.

37:34.667 --> 37:36.467
- All I can say is if it--

37:36.500 --> 37:38.166
if you were playing me
and you did that,

37:38.200 --> 37:39.567
and you said,
"I'm playing Teddi,"

37:39.600 --> 37:42.066
I would have my feelings hurt.
I would say--

37:42.100 --> 37:43.734
- I don't think
you feelings were hurt.

37:43.767 --> 37:45.533
I know your feelings
weren't hurt.

37:45.567 --> 37:47.433
- Not at all.

37:47.467 --> 37:49.433
- But were you not also shocked
that she talked like that?

37:49.467 --> 37:51.467
'Cause that was not a portrayal
of who you really are?

37:51.500 --> 37:53.033
- Who cares?

37:53.066 --> 37:54.567
Everyone knows that
that's a performance persona.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.133
It's a character.
She dressed up like that.

37:56.166 --> 37:57.700
- Yeah.

37:57.734 --> 37:59.500
- But we also need
to make it clear

37:59.533 --> 38:02.633
that hiding behind
a character was confusing.

38:02.667 --> 38:04.367
- What's the problem?

38:04.400 --> 38:06.133
What is the issue
you are having?

38:06.166 --> 38:07.533
If you have anything to say,

38:07.567 --> 38:08.567
say it now because
now it's out.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.400
- Well, what do you think?

38:10.433 --> 38:12.100
- I really don't
even understand

38:12.133 --> 38:13.667
where this is coming from.

38:13.700 --> 38:14.767
- I don't know what
the (BLEEP) Teddi's doing.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.467
To be honest with you.

38:16.500 --> 38:17.734
It's not her issue.

38:17.767 --> 38:19.734
Like, let's own our sh--.
All of us.

38:19.767 --> 38:23.033
Close it, Teddi.
None of your ----ing business.

38:23.066 --> 38:24.200
- I like you.

38:24.233 --> 38:25.700
It doesn't make me
like you any less.

38:25.734 --> 38:27.433
- I don't care whether
you like me or not.

38:27.467 --> 38:30.000
Don't put it all on me.

38:30.033 --> 38:31.467
♪ ♪

38:36.100 --> 38:36.633
- Hiding behind a character

38:36.633 --> 38:37.066
- Hiding behind a character
was confusing.

38:39.100 --> 38:40.633
- What's the problem?

38:40.667 --> 38:43.000
What is the issue
you are having?

38:43.033 --> 38:44.166
- I like you.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.667
It doesn't make me
like you any less.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.400
- I don't care whether
you like me or not.

38:47.433 --> 38:49.100
- Well, that bums me out.

38:49.133 --> 38:50.600
- No, but I--I hope you
like me, but I don't--

38:50.633 --> 38:51.734
- I mean...
- No, but--

38:52.000 --> 38:53.200
- I--I care if you like me.

38:53.233 --> 38:55.166
If you don't,
then why are we hanging out?

38:55.200 --> 38:58.133
- I don't care if you like me
whether I'm this person or not.

38:58.166 --> 39:00.433
- But that's where
I was confused.

39:00.467 --> 39:02.700
- I really don't know why
Kyle and Teddi

39:02.734 --> 39:04.767
are trying to bait Erika
into saying something.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.633
I don't get it.

39:06.667 --> 39:10.567
But I do know that Teddi,
more often than not,

39:10.600 --> 39:14.033
tends to be Kyle's henchwoman.

39:14.066 --> 39:17.100
- It was not an insult and it
did not come from a bad place.

39:17.133 --> 39:20.066
- But hard part is then
he goes, "Well, we're good.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.066
Me and Kim are good.
Me and Vanderpump are good."

39:22.100 --> 39:23.600
- That doesn't matter.

39:23.633 --> 39:24.700
I'm not talking about
that right now, Teddi.

39:24.734 --> 39:26.467
And do me a favor,

39:26.500 --> 39:29.200
let me have a conversation with
Kyle for two seconds.

39:29.233 --> 39:32.767
Wish I had that ----ing now.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.467
- If you're dressing up as me

39:35.500 --> 39:37.633
and you're being me
and you want to be--

39:37.667 --> 39:40.133
- I'm being Erika Jayne.
I'm not being Erika Girardi.

39:40.166 --> 39:41.533
I'm being Erika Jayne.

39:41.567 --> 39:42.600
- It is one human being.

39:42.633 --> 39:44.133
- You're the same human being.

39:44.166 --> 39:45.500
- It's not the same thing,
though, Teddi.

39:45.533 --> 39:47.000
Teddi, it's not
the same thing.

39:47.033 --> 39:48.700
I'm not gonna blame
Erika Jayne.

39:48.734 --> 39:50.500
I'm gonna honor Erika Jayne
'cause Erika Jayne allowed me

39:50.533 --> 39:53.600
to break the ice so that
I could have a conversation

39:53.633 --> 39:55.467
with your sister.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.467
I'm in a ----ing
Halloween costume.

39:57.500 --> 40:00.166
If it weren't for Kim,
everyone would've laughed,

40:00.200 --> 40:03.066
applauded,
and said Rinna is awesome!

40:03.100 --> 40:05.166
So all of a sudden it gets
a little sensitive

40:05.200 --> 40:06.533
because your sister's involved?

40:06.567 --> 40:08.266
----ing come on!

40:08.300 --> 40:10.567
- Everyone was uncomfortable
including Erika who's like--

40:10.600 --> 40:13.033
- But why didn't anyone
ever say anything?

40:13.066 --> 40:15.066
- About what?
- About your sister?

40:15.100 --> 40:17.266
- The end of the day,
no matter how it came about,

40:17.300 --> 40:18.734
it seems as if that
the two of you

40:18.767 --> 40:21.100
have come to some resolution.
- 100%.

40:21.133 --> 40:22.633
- So however uncomfortable
it may have been

40:22.667 --> 40:24.100
for all of us to watch--

40:24.133 --> 40:25.600
- Which it was!
That's all we're saying!

40:25.633 --> 40:27.200
Wasn't that a little
uncomfortable for you?

40:27.233 --> 40:28.767
- No, it wasn't for me,
but it was for you guys.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.333
I get that.

40:30.367 --> 40:32.000
Ladies, let me be very clear.

40:32.033 --> 40:34.166
I'm not annoyed that
Lisa Rinna

40:34.200 --> 40:35.667
used the Erika Jayne persona

40:35.700 --> 40:37.633
to heal her wounds with
Kim Richards.

40:37.667 --> 40:39.734
I am, however,
becoming annoyed

40:39.767 --> 40:42.033
at how you two will
not let it go.

40:42.066 --> 40:45.333
- Oh, so Erika's sort of--
it's her alter ego.

40:45.367 --> 40:49.266
It's this person that is free
to be who they want to be--

40:49.300 --> 40:51.200
- Maybe I need clarity
on that then.

40:51.233 --> 40:53.066
Is Erika Jayne--
and I know that--

40:53.100 --> 40:55.100
- Stop.

40:55.133 --> 40:58.066
It's a performance persona.

40:58.100 --> 41:00.600
You guys, quit trying to bait
me into this conversation.

41:02.734 --> 41:04.767
- Okay.

41:06.266 --> 41:07.734
When things get uncomfortable,

41:07.767 --> 41:09.700
I immediately want
to talk about it.

41:09.734 --> 41:12.600
And Erika wants to shut it
down before it even starts.

41:12.633 --> 41:14.200
- It's possible.

41:14.233 --> 41:15.633
- You're pretending that
it's fully amnesia right now.

41:15.667 --> 41:17.000
It's confusing.

41:17.033 --> 41:18.266
- Don't ever say that
to me again.

41:18.300 --> 41:19.600
Don't.
- Okay.

41:19.633 --> 41:21.333
Now it's gotten uncomfortable.

41:21.367 --> 41:23.700
So just explain it to--
I'm not being an idiot.

41:23.734 --> 41:25.233
- I didn't call you an idiot.

41:25.266 --> 41:26.700
I just said
it's a performance persona.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.367
- Did you--we went
to her concert.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.200
- Right, but I didn't
see her saying

41:30.233 --> 41:31.633
"(BLEEP) you, (BLEEP),"
to anybody.

41:31.667 --> 41:33.200
- Right, that--that's--
- I said (BLEEP).

41:33.233 --> 41:34.767
I did not call anyone
a (BLEEP).

41:35.000 --> 41:36.166
- But I'm not coming
at anyone,

41:36.200 --> 41:37.600
I'm trying to have
a conversation

41:37.633 --> 41:39.166
so I can understand.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.567
- However Lisa Rinna
interprets Erika Jayne

41:41.600 --> 41:43.266
or whatever behavior she has

41:43.300 --> 41:46.633
does not reflect upon me,
as Erika Girardi, as a person.

41:46.667 --> 41:49.367
- So you didn't think
it was weird.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.200
- It didn't affect me at all.

41:51.233 --> 41:53.667
As a matter of fact,
I'm glad that they've moved on.

41:53.700 --> 41:56.734
Teddi and Kyle are
very relentless about

41:56.767 --> 41:59.066

I would've been upset
about it weeks ago

42:05.066 --> 42:06.367

you're now upset with us

a little bit embarrassed

was dressed like me
