It's blood and bone. You marked
the talisman. I don't make the rules.

16:46.080 --> 16:50.080
I mean, basically, we need to deliver
three sacrifices by Maymass--

16:50.160 --> 16:52.760
Uh, that's May Day to you. Or else it's…

16:53.800 --> 16:55.480
Well, it's burning skies time.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.560
[breathing heavily]

16:59.680 --> 17:01.640
I sense you need some convincing.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.160
Uh… [sighs]

17:03.240 --> 17:05.320
Let me show you
how this will play out, all right?

17:05.400 --> 17:07.480
What'll happen if we don't succeed.
You ready?

17:08.880 --> 17:09.720
Ready?

17:10.560 --> 17:11.640
Three, two, one.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.240
[high-pitched tone]

17:13.760 --> 17:14.720
[gasps]

17:14.800 --> 17:16.800
[siren blaring]

17:21.160 --> 17:23.120
[Nida screaming]

17:23.200 --> 17:25.680
-[siren stops]
-[gasping, coughing]

17:25.760 --> 17:29.440
So, basically, this is the sort of thing
we're dealing with.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.280
-[siren blaring]
-[Nida coughing]

17:32.440 --> 17:34.040
-[siren stops]
-Scorching wall of flame.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.800
It's agonizing death for all, and so on.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.880
[siren blaring]

17:41.880 --> 17:44.000
-[siren stops]
-[Nida whimpering]

17:44.080 --> 17:45.240
[siren blaring]

17:45.320 --> 17:46.360
[whimpers in pain]

17:46.440 --> 17:48.440
[people screaming]

17:53.600 --> 17:55.040
-[siren stops]
-[Nida whimpering]

17:55.120 --> 17:56.840
-[siren blaring]
-[screams]

17:56.920 --> 17:58.440
-[siren stops]
-[Nida whimpering]

18:00.440 --> 18:01.720
[whimpering]

18:07.200 --> 18:08.560
[silence]

18:13.240 --> 18:16.040
See, burning people, they do smell
like you'd expect, don't they?

18:16.120 --> 18:18.480
Like a… a burger on a griddle.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.760
It's quite nice
if you disassociate from it.

18:20.840 --> 18:24.200
Mind you, the charred hair
really gets stuck in your throat.

18:32.080 --> 18:35.080
To be honest, I don't want the apocalypse
to come about any more than you do.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.040
So let's stop it happening, you and me.

18:37.120 --> 18:40.000
All we have to do
is deliver three sacrifices in three days.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.360
It's only three killings.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.840
Like I said, animals don't count.
You have to do humans.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.400
And there's gotta be a cadence to it.
One a day.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.760
[chuckles] It's one kill a day. It… it's…

18:51.840 --> 18:53.240
Wha… what?

18:55.440 --> 18:56.920
[panting]

18:58.400 --> 19:02.680
That is fewer people than die falling off
ladders in the same time period.

19:02.760 --> 19:05.000
You'd be less lethal than a ladder.

19:05.080 --> 19:08.040
If I talk to you, you're real,
so I'm not gonna talk to you.

19:08.120 --> 19:10.960
Well, we started conversing already,
so that ship has sailed.

19:11.040 --> 19:13.240
-No, it hasn't.
-Oh, oh, yes, it has.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.160
-[Nida grunts]
-Uh, don't worry. We're a team.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.960
I'm on your side here, you know?

19:17.040 --> 19:20.360
Let's just get kill number one
under your belt. Start racking 'em up.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.880
You can stop it
because I am not killing anyone.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.240
[Nida continues indistinctly]

19:25.320 --> 19:27.120
…so I don't know
why you keep talking to me!

19:27.200 --> 19:30.040
That's what I'm here for.
All right? Moral support.

19:30.120 --> 19:33.160
So just hold on to that brick.
Let's go thwack someone.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.800
-What brick?
-The one in your hand, love.

19:38.160 --> 19:39.040
[Nida gasps]

19:42.080 --> 19:43.440
I'm not doing what you say.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.520
What's that, love?

19:46.360 --> 19:48.080
[Gaap] Oh yeah.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.280
Yeah, he's perfect.

19:49.360 --> 19:50.600
There's no witnesses.

19:50.680 --> 19:52.400
-Talk about beginner's luck.
-[Nida] No.

19:52.480 --> 19:54.720
One quick pop to the head and you're done.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.520
Please, make him stop.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.120
Make who stop?

20:04.600 --> 20:06.720
Love? Are you all right?

20:09.040 --> 20:11.360
-I need a doctor.
-You want me to go and call one?

20:11.440 --> 20:14.400
Would it help if I told you
I can see into this man's soul,

20:14.480 --> 20:16.160
and he absolutely deserves to die?

20:16.240 --> 20:17.880
-Shut up!
-[Gaap] He's got a daughter.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.960
Her name's Laura. She's eight years old.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.000
Do you wanna know what he does to her?
To Laura?

20:23.080 --> 20:25.560
-No, I don't wanna know.
-Sorry, love. I don't follow.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.120
He pays Laura a little nighttime visit--

20:28.200 --> 20:29.200
[Nida] Shut up!

20:29.280 --> 20:30.880
[man] Is everything okay?

20:30.960 --> 20:34.200
Do you wanna know how the bastard
makes her feel? Get a load of this.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.640
[unsettling music playing]

20:38.000 --> 20:38.960
[gasps]

20:43.360 --> 20:44.200
[whimpers]

20:45.640 --> 20:51.000
She kills herself, aged 28,
exhausted by the pain and the shame of it.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.200
[gasps]

20:52.280 --> 20:54.640
Maybe put that down.

20:56.040 --> 20:57.160
[man grunts]

20:59.160 --> 21:01.320
[dog barking]

21:01.400 --> 21:02.320
[gasps]

21:09.320 --> 21:11.320
[dog sniffing, whimpers]

21:22.240 --> 21:23.800
[retching]

21:23.880 --> 21:26.280
[retching, coughing]

21:27.000 --> 21:27.920
[groans]

21:29.440 --> 21:32.320
Yeah, it does take some getting used to,
I'll grant you that.

21:32.400 --> 21:35.720
But a couple more of those
and I'll be out of your hair. [chuckles]

21:36.240 --> 21:37.200
Look, hang on.

21:38.440 --> 21:41.600
Uh… Yeah, yeah. Look, see? One line gone.

21:41.680 --> 21:43.640
That's one sacrifice registered.
Two to go.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.000
You've got a whole day
to pick the next one.

21:47.160 --> 21:48.640
Oh, come on. You--

21:49.320 --> 21:50.920
You forgot to flush.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.320
Oof. Fuck me.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.240
[indistinct chattering]

22:03.160 --> 22:04.520
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.600
-[man] What is it, Suz?
-A missing person.

22:07.680 --> 22:08.520
[man] Boy or girl?

22:08.600 --> 22:10.440
A 39-year-old man.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.240
A Tim Simons.

22:13.560 --> 22:14.440
No, don't know him.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.520
[Suzie] His wife said
he didn't come home last night.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.200
Yeah, because he's on the piss.

22:18.280 --> 22:19.880
It's not even 24 hours yet.

22:19.960 --> 22:24.120
I know, but, sir, the thing is,
she says his dog came home without him.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.160
[dog whimpering]

22:35.240 --> 22:37.920
I suppose we stopped taking pictures
of each other.

22:42.120 --> 22:42.960
Here.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.080
That's him.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.920
He… he never stays out. He…

22:52.280 --> 22:54.760
Something's happened. I know it.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.720
We don't know anything's happened at all.

22:58.920 --> 22:59.760
Hello.

23:00.800 --> 23:01.800
Who's this?

23:03.120 --> 23:04.360
It's okay.

23:04.440 --> 23:05.480
It's okay, Laura.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.680
This man and this lady
are going to help find Daddy.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.200
Worried sick, aren't you, love?

23:22.480 --> 23:24.520
[Gaap] How long are you
just gonna sit there for?

23:24.600 --> 23:28.560
You're late for work. You have to go in.
You can't have people getting suspicious.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.000
[chuckles] I mean it.
If you don't turn up--

23:31.080 --> 23:32.040
Fucking shut up!

23:34.960 --> 23:35.880
I killed a man.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.840
-I've killed someone.
-Yeah, that was hours ago.

23:38.920 --> 23:41.720
I keep feeling the crack of his skull
on the brick.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.080
I did that.

23:47.000 --> 23:47.840
It's your fault.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.320
You're not even-- [inhales deeply]

23:51.120 --> 23:52.640
[whimpers]

23:53.920 --> 23:54.880
I'm crazy.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.920
I'm a crazy person.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.320
They said Mum was mad.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.040
They'll say it about me.

24:02.120 --> 24:05.320
But this time, they'll be right.
They'll be totally bloody right.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.840
Hey, look, look. You're not crazy.

24:06.920 --> 24:08.000
I'm a murderer.

24:08.600 --> 24:09.920
Yeah, but you're not a crazy one.

24:12.360 --> 24:13.680
Why is this happening?

24:15.440 --> 24:16.280
Look.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.240
This is actually my first assignment.

24:21.760 --> 24:25.320
It's more of an initiation, really.
Sort of earning my wings.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.600
I mean, I'm new to this too.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.480
I'm not a bad person.

24:30.560 --> 24:34.920
Oh no. No. It wouldn't work if you were.
It has to be someone corruptible.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.920
So, I mean, if you think about it,
what's happening here,

24:39.000 --> 24:41.520
it actually reflects really well
on your character.

24:44.880 --> 24:45.760
Huh?

24:46.920 --> 24:47.760
Yeah.

24:51.960 --> 24:53.240
What… what are you doing?

24:53.760 --> 24:55.960
-Calling the police.
-What? Why?

24:56.040 --> 24:57.720
[tense music playing]

24:57.800 --> 24:59.440
-Why?
-So they'll arrest me.

24:59.520 --> 25:02.720
[chuckles] But then you won't be able
to do the other sacrifices.

25:02.800 --> 25:03.640
Good!

25:03.720 --> 25:06.480
Then the apocalypse will happen,
and billions will die.

25:06.560 --> 25:07.840
I mean, I know. I get it.

25:07.920 --> 25:10.680
You don't want the blood
of three victims on your hands,

25:10.760 --> 25:12.520
but if it saves billions…

25:18.280 --> 25:19.600
[phone line ringing]

25:23.040 --> 25:25.600
[man] Hello, emergency services.
What service do you require?

25:27.960 --> 25:28.840
Hello?

25:30.760 --> 25:32.320
Hello? Is anyone there--

25:33.760 --> 25:36.320
[exhales in relief]

25:36.840 --> 25:38.800
See? You… you are a good person.

25:40.760 --> 25:41.640
What do I do?

25:43.480 --> 25:47.480
Just carry on as usual
so the normals don't get spooked,

25:47.560 --> 25:49.440
which means going to work.

25:50.080 --> 25:53.440
And while you're there,
we can decide who to kill next.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.040
[muzak softly playing]

26:10.000 --> 26:11.120
Hello.

26:11.720 --> 26:12.800
What's this?

26:14.400 --> 26:16.400
You were supposed to be in at 9:00.

26:17.120 --> 26:19.680
I threw up this morning.
I thought I might be ill.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.160
Oh, don't come near me.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.840
I don't want your germs.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.320
You look awful.

26:28.600 --> 26:29.760
Well, she's nice.

26:30.280 --> 26:33.280
Front-runner for the old…
[mimics throat slitting] I think.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.360
Uh, she does steal from the till,
you know.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.880
-Gotta pick someone!
-Sh!

26:44.360 --> 26:47.600
God, I… I do love a little old lady. Hey…

26:47.680 --> 26:49.280
[inhales deeply]

26:49.360 --> 26:50.560
Oh, isn't she sweet?

26:51.440 --> 26:53.680
She can't stop thinking
about the end though.

26:53.760 --> 26:56.760
They can't wait for it to come.
You'd be doing her a favor.

26:56.840 --> 26:57.840
Shut up.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.400
-[woman] What was that, love?
-Nothing.

27:00.520 --> 27:04.160
-She dreams of death. Even now--
-How are those for you?

27:04.240 --> 27:06.880
I think they're good.
I'll just go and have a little look.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.400
Just do it. No one will miss her.

27:09.480 --> 27:10.920
No, shut up.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.800
She's nearly dead already.

27:14.560 --> 27:15.480
Very nice.

27:17.360 --> 27:18.200
Sir?

27:22.200 --> 27:23.880
-Sir?
-[man] Yeah?

27:23.960 --> 27:25.480
They said you're in here.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.000
That was nice of 'em.

27:29.400 --> 27:32.320
-Can it wait?
-[Suzie] It's Tim Simons.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.320
[man] Oh aye. Turned up, has he?

27:34.400 --> 27:36.400
[Suzie] He has, sir, but he's dead.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.920
Someone's clobbered him, sir.

27:44.640 --> 27:45.840
So they have.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.320
[man] So, come on.
What time do you finish?

27:53.400 --> 27:55.440
Depends what time you wanna start.

27:56.560 --> 27:57.600
[Vicky chuckles]

27:57.680 --> 27:59.400
Maybe I won't wanna stop.

28:00.560 --> 28:04.000
[Vicky] And maybe I won't wanna stop you.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.680
[Vicky laughs]

28:09.200 --> 28:10.920
How about this handsome fucker, eh?

28:11.000 --> 28:13.520
God's gift till he loses his hair at 32

28:13.600 --> 28:16.160
and spends the next 29 years
taking it out on his missus.

28:16.240 --> 28:17.400
[tense music playing]

28:17.480 --> 28:18.560
[woman whimpers]

28:18.640 --> 28:19.560
[gasps]

28:19.640 --> 28:22.120
-Stop showing me this stuff.
-His missus won't be her.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.480
She never marries. Very sad.

28:23.560 --> 28:27.840
Well, well, look. It's half-five already.
You gotta get the next one in by midnight.

28:27.920 --> 28:29.920
You have to pick someone.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.080
On your last trip, did you discover
what the Earth people eat?

28:34.160 --> 28:35.720
They eat a great many of these.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.240
They peel them with their metal knives.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.200
Boil them for 20 of their minutes.

28:42.280 --> 28:43.600

44:07.320 --> 44:09.360
I mean, the first bloke,
the one by the canal,

44:09.440 --> 44:12.880
they're giving us that one 'cause
he's never actually killed anybody, but…

44:12.960 --> 44:14.840
What about what he did to his daughter?

44:14.920 --> 44:17.200
You said she kills herself at 28,
thanks to him.

44:17.280 --> 44:18.560
Yeah, but that's in the future.

44:20.440 --> 44:21.520
I'm sorry.

44:21.600 --> 44:24.480
Look, basically, anyone
who's already been directly responsible

44:24.560 --> 44:27.800
for the death of another human being,
they're off-limits.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.960
Once that's happened,
as far as my boss is concerned,

44:31.040 --> 44:32.680
they're playing for the home team.

44:34.160 --> 44:36.280
You know, we're actually lucky

44:36.360 --> 44:39.040
that Keith's brother
turned up just before midnight.

44:39.120 --> 44:40.960
It would've been Armageddon otherwise.

44:44.440 --> 44:46.880
Look, you did well.

44:51.040 --> 44:53.560
Oh, absolutely go fuck yourself!

44:54.080 --> 44:55.560
Right up a tree!

44:57.040 --> 44:58.840
-This is all right for you.
-It isn't.

44:58.920 --> 45:01.240
No blood on your hands.
You're just watching.

45:01.320 --> 45:02.800
Light entertainment.

45:02.880 --> 45:05.600
If the apocalypse does come,
you'll have a big fun finale.

45:05.680 --> 45:09.240
-That'd be upending the whole place--
-It's frowned upon. You get told off.

45:09.320 --> 45:11.080
-If I fail my initiation…
-[Nida laughs]

45:11.160 --> 45:14.040
Kicked out of demon school? Boo-hoo.

45:14.120 --> 45:15.920
-More like cast out.
-Whatever.

45:17.320 --> 45:20.120
Cast out into a boundless, cosmic void.

45:22.440 --> 45:26.720
And doomed to spend eternity
in a vacuum of infinite nothingness.

45:27.360 --> 45:31.840
Absence of matter, of time,
of space, light, and sound.

45:33.480 --> 45:37.240
I would endure a profound, palpable,

45:37.320 --> 45:40.360
and ever-present lack of existence,

45:40.440 --> 45:43.320
alone in perpetuity,

45:44.400 --> 45:45.440
forever more.

45:52.600 --> 45:54.000
Sounds like my life.

45:58.960 --> 46:00.440
To be honest, I'm scared.

46:19.560 --> 46:21.280
So one more victim, then.

46:22.040 --> 46:23.600
Yeah, only thing for it.

46:24.480 --> 46:27.840
-I can't be doing a total innocent.
-It's just murderers we have to avoid.

46:27.920 --> 46:29.280
You mean people like me.

46:31.480 --> 46:33.880
My whole life,
I never wished harm on anyone.

46:33.960 --> 46:34.920
[Gaap scoffs]

46:37.160 --> 46:38.000
I didn't.

46:39.360 --> 46:40.200
Uh…

46:41.760 --> 46:44.520
You couldn't have summoned me
for my trial if you hadn't.

46:44.600 --> 46:48.240
Well, you had to be corruptible,
not beyond corruption.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.640
You know what? You must have had
some dark force inside you

46:53.720 --> 46:56.400
when you touched the talisman.
There's no shame in it.

46:57.160 --> 47:00.520
No, go on. Who pissed you off?

47:00.600 --> 47:02.600
[eerie music playing]

47:18.600 --> 47:20.720
[chilling music intensifies]

47:20.800 --> 47:23.760
So I'm thinking just lure her
down to the basement on some pretense,

47:23.840 --> 47:26.640
clock her on the stairwell,
and say she lost her step and fell.

47:27.160 --> 47:29.840
[Vicky] Snap out of it.
You can deal with the kid out there.

47:29.920 --> 47:33.120
Needs black shoes for a funeral.
They pulled her dad out of the canal.

47:34.320 --> 47:38.000
I'd do it myself,
but she gives me the willies.

47:38.720 --> 47:40.720
[muzak softly playing]

47:53.120 --> 47:55.360
[Gaap] Well, she… she…
she's not in mourning.

47:56.040 --> 47:57.800
Well, she's… she's not not mourning.

47:59.280 --> 48:01.960
Happy it's finished. Sad he's dead. It…

48:02.480 --> 48:05.360
But… it has finished.

48:05.440 --> 48:08.080
You… you spared her
another five years of it.

48:08.160 --> 48:09.720
A lifetime of therapy,

48:09.800 --> 48:12.240
but a lifetime, nonetheless.

48:13.440 --> 48:17.040
She's a mum at 29. A nan at 57.

48:18.320 --> 48:19.480
Eh?

48:19.560 --> 48:21.280
I just thought you'd like to know.

48:28.400 --> 48:29.360
It's a good fit.

48:30.360 --> 48:32.680
[man 1] And, of course, the final touch.

48:32.760 --> 48:35.080
-[man 2] Colin, really? You--
-No, no, no, no, no.

48:35.160 --> 48:36.680
-I insist. Too late.
-[man 2] Very well.

48:36.760 --> 48:39.000
[man 1] Here we are in footwear.

48:39.080 --> 48:41.560
This is Mr. Michael Smart.

48:41.640 --> 48:44.520
You probably recognize him.
He's all set to be our next MP.

48:44.600 --> 48:46.800
Well, with a little luck
and a following wind.

48:46.880 --> 48:48.320
[both laughing]

48:48.400 --> 48:50.920
-His father and I were at school together.
-Fuck me.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.360
[man 1] He's been using my weekend cottage
as a base of operations.

48:54.440 --> 48:56.520
-You can tell he's ex-military.
-[laughs]

48:56.600 --> 48:58.760
Michael's got a big speech tonight
at the town hall.

48:58.840 --> 49:01.600
I promised him a new suit and new shoes.

49:01.680 --> 49:05.080
The finest that Possetts has to offer.
[whispers] On the house.

49:05.160 --> 49:07.160
I've told him
he'll go out of business at this rate.

49:07.240 --> 49:09.200
[both laughing]

49:10.400 --> 49:11.400
Fuck me some more.

49:11.480 --> 49:15.280
Well, I said I'd leave you in the hands
of our finest assistant, so, um…

49:15.800 --> 49:18.720
Vicky, if you could take care of Michael.

49:18.800 --> 49:22.480
Michael, enjoy Vicky's
more than capable hands.

49:22.560 --> 49:25.720
-Hey, steady on there. Steady on.
-[Vicky] Won't you walk this way?

49:25.800 --> 49:28.440
[Michael] I'll walk
however you want. [laughs]

49:28.520 --> 49:31.800
For Christ's sake,
there's boxes all over the floor.

49:31.880 --> 49:34.320
Would you pick up your bloody mess?

49:37.640 --> 49:39.520
I'm thinking car park later.

49:39.600 --> 49:41.840
Wait till he comes out. Reverse into him.

49:41.920 --> 49:43.400
Pin him up against the wall.

49:43.480 --> 49:46.400
Keep the pedal down
till you hear the stomach pop.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.640
Eh? What do you think?

49:48.720 --> 49:49.760
[Michael laughs]

49:49.840 --> 49:52.160
-[Michael] I won't tell if you don't.
-What?

49:52.240 --> 49:54.040
[Vicky, Michael laugh]

49:56.280 --> 49:58.320
[Michael] I hope
I have your vote this week.

49:58.400 --> 50:00.840
Afraid not. National Front for me.

50:00.920 --> 50:02.280
Oh!

50:02.360 --> 50:03.200
Why is that?

50:03.800 --> 50:05.920
Don't like how things
are changing around here.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Mm.

50:07.080 --> 50:10.560
My aunt, she's been in Cheetham 20 years.

50:11.240 --> 50:13.320
Now she's got them living either side.

50:13.400 --> 50:16.160
That's what's next.
We've not got a pot to piss in,

50:16.240 --> 50:18.520
so why should we share with them
who don't belong?

50:19.920 --> 50:22.240
You think voting National Front will help?

50:22.320 --> 50:23.960
I think they'll stand up for us.

50:24.480 --> 50:26.560
Says so
right on the front of their leaflet.

50:26.640 --> 50:28.240
But they won't get elected.

50:29.560 --> 50:31.560
-They might.
-They're too overt.

51:16.400 --> 51:17.480
do I have your vote?

51:21.240 --> 51:22.120
Yes, sir.

51:25.000 --> 51:25.880
Good girl.

51:27.960 --> 51:31.400
[Gaap] So, who are you gonna kill,
your boss or Vicky? You haven't got long.

51:31.480 --> 51:33.360
What's his future? Michael Smart?

51:33.440 --> 51:35.600
-Uh, it--
-Can you show me his future?

51:35.680 --> 51:37.840
-Yeah, but let's not--
-Then show me right now.

51:39.400 --> 51:42.080
Or I'll run out there,
confess to everything,

51:42.160 --> 51:44.640
and then it's over,
and then you're fucked.

51:46.040 --> 51:47.040

[Gaap] No, he's not one of ours,
not literally.

52:29.960 --> 52:33.320
I mean, they do like him.
They're fans of his work, you might say.

52:33.400 --> 52:34.240
He's got to go.

52:35.600 --> 52:38.360
-He's next.
-Oh, uh, they are not gonna like that.

52:38.440 --> 52:40.920
Just avoid murderers.
You said that was the one rule.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.240
Right, but he's responsible
for an impressive number of juicy deaths--

52:44.320 --> 52:45.640
Not yet he isn't.

52:45.720 --> 52:48.240
Right, but he… he… he beats his wife.

-Hasn't killed her, though, has he?
-I mean…

with a rock when he was 12.

-Does Michael Smart qualify or not?
-Well, technically, yeah, but--

Then I choose Michael Smart.
He's the one. That's that.

53:05.080 --> 53:07.360
Honestly, they are not gonna like it.

53:07.440 --> 53:09.560
But it's within the rules,
so they can lump it.

53:11.240 --> 53:12.080

I failed.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.920

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:20.240
Just got word.
They are casting me out. Eternal oblivion.

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:23.880

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.640
Oh no, it's much worse than that.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:56.960
It's with me.

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.800
I'll give it a go.
