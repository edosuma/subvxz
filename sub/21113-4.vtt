Jane, our intrepid writer,

00:07.141 --> 00:08.809

a congresswoman

everything is political...

strange but sexy bedfellows.

than we usually do.

a look at the numbers,

and character references,

you could write me one.

will help.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.498
- But why do you need
a headshot?

06:37.531 --> 06:40.434
- Because I am appearing
on a panel:

06:40.468 --> 06:42.836

with influential voices.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.638

- I know.

seemed impressed.

but you are killing me.

Actually, no, I can't.
Uh, Sutton...

without an assistant,

in your favor.

to create a mood board.

to tell me who you are.

- Okay.
I can do that.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.833
- Sutton,
make me feel something.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.836
- Absolutely.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.103
Thank you for considering me.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.272
- You should thank Lauren.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.842
I don't think I've ever heard
her gush about someone before.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.544
It was kind of alarming.

07:56.577 --> 07:57.845

she brought me two names,

and someone else,

has zero fashion experience,

at the mall.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.554
I mean, who doesn't work
at the mall at some point?

08:06.587 --> 08:08.589
Anyway, I love
that you went to FIT.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.990

- Obviously, I have

I have favors and such,

actually, I--

- Sorry, I have to go talk
to Jacqueline--bye.

I didn't go there.

You're good at this.

08:38.919 --> 08:39.987
You should just
tell him the truth.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.822
- Wait, why?

08:41.855 --> 08:42.956
So he can take her
out of the running?

08:42.990 --> 08:44.224
No, this is not her fault.

08:44.257 --> 08:45.993
- Are you saying I should lie?
- No.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.728
I'm saying you should, you know,

08:47.761 --> 08:49.196
take advantage
of the circumstances.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.932
- Yeah, but he's gonna
find out eventually.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.000
- [scoffs]
How?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.768
How is he gonna find out?

08:54.802 --> 08:56.069
- He could ask
to see her diploma.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.771
- Seriously?

08:57.805 --> 08:59.006
I never even
picked up my diploma.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.874
For all I know,
I didn't graduate.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.976
Oh, God, what if I never
graduated college?

09:03.010 --> 09:05.078
- That's probably why you have
that recurring anxiety dream.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.947
- Yeah, the one where
I'm the last one on campus,

09:06.980 --> 09:09.049
I'm two credits short,
and they have all those little--

09:09.082 --> 09:12.019
- Oh, my God, can we please not
analyze Kat's dreams right now?

09:12.052 --> 09:14.755
- Totally, yeah.

Let me guess: juice run.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.759
- Yep.
- Does she ever eat solid foods?

09:18.792 --> 09:19.960
- I'm gonna die on this desk.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.962
- Listen,
all you got to do is just,

09:21.995 --> 09:24.231
you know, impress him
with your mood thing.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.901
- No, Jane's right.
I have to tell him.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.904
I mean, I have to tell him.
Right?

09:30.938 --> 09:33.040
- Yes.
- No.

- Yes.

09:40.881 --> 09:44.217
Three other panelists,
all political writers,

09:44.251 --> 09:48.288
and it's called "Young Reporters
with Influential Voices."

09:48.321 --> 09:50.057
- Ooh.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.091
- Can you give me
a big smile, please?

09:51.124 --> 09:52.793
- Actually, I want to do a few

09:52.826 --> 09:55.295
where I look
a little more serious.

09:55.328 --> 09:58.031
Do I look like
an influential voice?

- Hi.

- What are you doing here?

10:18.285 --> 10:19.753
Is this for an article?

10:19.787 --> 10:21.188
Actually, don't answer that.

I don't want to know
why you're looking at lotion.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.225
- There's a rumor you guys have
a spa hidden somewhere in here.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.727
I wanted to check it out.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.295
- Is there?
- Mm.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.765
I had fun last night.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.333
Seems like maybe
you had fun too?

10:34.768 --> 10:36.103
- I did.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.939
- Good, 'cause, I mean,

10:38.972 --> 10:40.874
you have admitted in the past

10:40.908 --> 10:43.043
to faking the fun
you were having.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.813
- I had fun.

10:48.281 --> 10:52.052
I had fun twice, actually.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.787
- Okay then.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.924
- So is that why you came here?

10:56.957 --> 10:59.059
To fact check
how much fun I had?

10:59.092 --> 11:02.129
- Mm-hmm, and to invite you
over tonight.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.364
What do you think?

11:04.397 --> 11:08.301
- I wish I could, but actually,
I'm speaking on this panel

11:08.335 --> 11:09.937
at The Writers' Room.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.339

I'll come watch.

Isn't it, you know,

Uh, do you mind if I...

11:30.023 --> 11:31.892
- Oh, it's all yours.

- Okay.
Cool.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.168

I have to speak
to Adena's unique skills.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.176
Okay, see, now it makes sense

"And submit
on official letterhead."

11:51.244 --> 11:53.080
- Sorry, not seeing
the significance here.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.248
- God, it is a dark day

11:55.282 --> 11:58.185
when I'm the most legit person
in someone's life.

11:58.218 --> 12:02.422
- Or she really cares about
the way that you see her.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.058
- You know, I cannot get
a read on her.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.427
- It's a crazy idea, but you
could ask her how she feels.

12:07.460 --> 12:12.265
Or, better yet, use the letter
as an excuse to hang out.

12:12.299 --> 12:15.102
- Sutton Brady,
are you asking me to lie?

12:15.135 --> 12:17.104
- No, definitely not.
- Eh?

12:17.137 --> 12:20.073
- But I am telling you to use
the situation to your advantage.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.875
Tell her that you want
to get the letter right,

12:21.909 --> 12:23.143
but that you have questions,

12:23.176 --> 12:24.845
and then while
you're asking those questions,

12:24.878 --> 12:26.880
say how you feel.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.952
- You know, that's actually
not a bad idea.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.286
- Mm.

- Hi, Richard.
Come in.

12:47.167 --> 12:51.238
- So, I reached out to some of
the big movers on the board,

12:51.271 --> 12:53.073
and--you know what?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.274
I'm gonna stand
while you're walking.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.977
- Oh, no, you're fine.
What's up?

- You know how much respect
they all have for you, right?

12:59.412 --> 13:01.181
- Yes...

13:01.214 --> 13:04.351
- "Scarlet" is
the biggest magazine we have.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.286
They're worried
about rocking the boat.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.088
- Maybe they should think
we're the biggest magazine

13:08.121 --> 13:10.924
they have
because we rock the boat.

13:10.958 --> 13:15.028
- I get it, but alienating even
a portion of the core readership

13:15.062 --> 13:17.030
right now is a big risk.

13:17.064 --> 13:19.266
- And it's a risk worth taking.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.101
I also think that
they should trust me.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.408
- Jane Sloan,
our youngest writer,

13:28.441 --> 13:31.144
is on a panel about
politics in the woke generation.

who went to fashion school.

you were on the panel?

- Nope.

14:55.162 --> 14:57.064
- I feel like this moves you out
of casual sex territory.

- Did you know
that Richard's going?

15:07.574 --> 15:09.542
- Why?

15:09.576 --> 15:11.278
- Jacqueline wants to expand the
magazine's political coverage.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.113
She wants to show him
how woke we are.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.148

15:26.193 --> 15:27.660

Ordinarily, I'd say
picture the audience naked,

15:29.662 --> 15:32.232

handle Peterson,

In other words,
why is it important for us

19:21.261 --> 19:22.595

19:22.629 --> 19:24.431
- Oh, um...

19:24.464 --> 19:26.199
I'm so glad you asked
that question,

19:26.233 --> 19:28.601
because the answer
could not be more simple.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.504
Young people want to be engaged,

19:31.538 --> 19:33.973
and right now, there's a lot
to be afraid of,

19:34.006 --> 19:35.975
and when you're scared,

19:36.008 --> 19:37.610
you need voices
that you can trust,

19:37.644 --> 19:40.613
and so it's up to us
to be those voices.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.915
- I actually think
that's overly simple.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.617
We're in an age
where the ephemeral nature

19:44.651 --> 19:45.985
of the Internet creates

19:46.018 --> 19:48.521
the need to be
first and loudest,

19:48.555 --> 19:51.258
so trust is actually secondary.

it lets them feel engaged,

and that's what people want
right now--to feel engaged.
