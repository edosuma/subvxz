WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:04.003
- Ace McFumbles here
with a special

00:04.086 --> 00:05.880
Homecoming Week broadcast.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.424
On Saturday, our Bulldogs play

00:07.507 --> 00:09.926
their biggest game of the year
against crosstown rivals--

00:10.009 --> 00:13.012
the Cobras!
[hissing]

00:13.096 --> 00:16.516
Oh, yes, after last year's
crushing defeat,

00:16.599 --> 00:19.394
our Bulldogs are eager to win
back the hometown crown.

00:19.477 --> 00:22.605
And in social news,
the school is a-hum with mums--

00:22.689 --> 00:27.068
the Texas tradition of mum
corsages, that is.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.154
Remember, if someone
gives you one of these,

00:29.237 --> 00:32.448
you've got yourself a date
to the Homecoming Dance.

00:32.531 --> 00:34.284
- [glass shattering]

00:34.367 --> 00:36.035
- Last, but not least,
Homecoming Court nominees

00:36.119 --> 00:37.704
were just posted to the main
bulletin board.

00:37.787 --> 00:41.291
Let's go to Chauncy, our man on
the scene with the results.

00:41.374 --> 00:44.210
- I've gotta say...[chuckling]
the mood is electric.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.963
- STUDENTS: [screaming]

00:47.046 --> 00:48.882
- PEPPER: I'm afraid to look.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.884
- It's safe!
- We're all up there!

00:50.967 --> 00:52.719
- PEPPER, BELLA, SOPHIE:
[screaming]

00:52.802 --> 00:54.554
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yay!

00:54.637 --> 00:55.638
- This is so cool!

00:55.722 --> 00:58.016
Now we'll all be in the yearbook
picture together.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.768
- Picture? Oh, no.
- What?

00:59.851 --> 01:00.852
- My zit nemesis is coming back.

01:00.935 --> 01:04.022
- You mean your nemezit?

01:04.105 --> 01:06.232
- Yes, the zit that wants
to ruin my life.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.734
It always shows up
at the worst time.

01:07.817 --> 01:10.153
- It's nothing.

01:10.236 --> 01:13.490
- Yeah, nothing at all.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.201
- Pepper, you're lying.
You always blink when you lie.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.744
- [gasping]
I would never!

01:19.829 --> 01:21.414
- I'm out.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.625
I've gotta stick my face
in some zit cream.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.878
- It's all happening--the three
of us on Homecoming Court.

01:26.961 --> 01:28.338
[gasping]
And there's a dance.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.048
- I know.
I wish I had a date.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.717
But I haven't had a spark
with anyone since Kyle.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.385
It's probably for the best.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.930
I have to focus on
the Homecoming game.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.181
- Okay, don't tell anyone,

01:38.264 --> 01:42.101
but I've kinda had
a spark with someone.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.270
I'm hoping he'll give me a mum.
- Seriously? Who?

01:44.354 --> 01:46.272
- Oh, I'm dying to tell you.
Okay, it's--

01:46.356 --> 01:48.775
No, I can't.
I don't want to jinx it.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.527
- I totally understand.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.529
This is so exciting!
- PEPPER: [squealing]

01:52.612 --> 01:54.864
- Ladies, relax.
I've worn this shirt before.

01:54.948 --> 01:58.284
- This is not about you, Troy.
This is about Homecoming.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.412
- Bella, Sophie and I got
elected to Homecoming Court

02:01.496 --> 02:02.956
and we're girling out hard.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.958
- Bella, I'm so
disappointed in you.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.876
You should be focused
on the game,

02:06.960 --> 02:08.086
not some outdated
popularity contest.

02:08.169 --> 02:11.172
- Troy, you got nominated
for Homecoming King.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.716
- What? Yes!
All right! I'm King!

02:13.800 --> 02:18.638
All hail King Troy! I did it!
Did you hear? I'm King!

02:18.721 --> 02:20.890
- Should we tell him
he hasn't won yet?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.892
- Let's let him have this.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.436

02:25.520 --> 02:27.230

02:36.322 --> 02:37.323

unlimited sundaes--

02:44.831 --> 02:46.040
{\an8}- Oh, should I call
my legal representative?

02:46.124 --> 02:47.333
{\an8}Hello? Hey.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.836
{\an8}- No. I just settled
a lawsuit.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.255

{\an8}Here you go.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.393
{\an8}- The only thing that tastes
better than free ice cream

03:05.476 --> 03:07.687

victory after Saturday's game.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.188

03:09.272 --> 03:10.607

We're gonna crush those Cobras.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.485
- TROY: [clearing throat]

03:14.569 --> 03:17.113
- Oh, don't look now,
but the Cobras just walked in.

03:17.196 --> 03:18.656
- Where?
- I said don't look.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.659
- Right there.

- Can you believe these
guys have the guts

03:31.836 --> 03:33.004
to show their faces in here
after last year's game?

03:33.087 --> 03:36.633
- Oh, yeah? Well, uh,
these faces are gonna be

03:36.716 --> 03:38.968
in your nightmares after
we destroy you on Saturday.

03:39.052 --> 03:43.139
- Ha. Keep dreaming. We're goin'
all the way this year.

03:43.222 --> 03:46.643
We even ordered
our championship jackets.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.937
- BOTH: Oh!

03:49.020 --> 03:55.026
- Well, that's fine because, ha,
we don't even wear jackets.

03:55.109 --> 03:57.612
- You're wearing
a jacket right now.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.739
- Uh, no, no, this is...
this is a coat.

03:59.822 --> 04:02.450
I bought it, actually--
- What he meant was...

04:02.533 --> 04:03.284
we're gonna kick
your butts so hard,

04:03.368 --> 04:05.954
your grandkids will feel it.

04:06.037 --> 04:06.955
- BULLDOGS: Oh...

04:07.038 --> 04:09.624
- Yeah, you Cobras are
going to be crushed.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.084
We're gonna skin
you snakes alive

04:11.167 --> 04:14.087
'cause mama needs
a new pair of boots!

04:14.170 --> 04:15.088
- SAWYER: Oh, yeah.
- BELLA: Mm-hm.

04:15.171 --> 04:18.841
- Whatever.
- That's what I thought.

04:24.722 --> 04:28.184
- Hey, you sure know
how to smack talk.

04:28.267 --> 04:29.602
- It's a gift.
- I'll say.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.145
You really put them
in their place.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.480
- Yeah, well, they deserved it.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.190
You mess with my team,
you answer to me.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.234
- I like a girl with attitude.
I'm Zach.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.987
- I'm Bella.
- Yeah, I know who you are.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.989
I saw you play against
the Bears.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.448
You can really sling it.

04:42.532 --> 04:43.950
- I've heard that
said about me.

04:44.033 --> 04:46.953
- We should hang out sometime.
- Yes, we should.

04:47.036 --> 04:50.540
- Uh, how about Saturday night?
- That's cool.

04:50.623 --> 04:53.960
Oh, wait, Saturday's
our Homecoming Dance.

04:54.043 --> 04:56.879
- I mean, if you don't have
a date, I could go with you.

04:56.963 --> 05:00.341
I don't have a mum, but--
- Then you better go get one.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.552
That means "Yes," by the way.
[laughing]

05:02.635 --> 05:04.512
- Oh, cool.
All right, then, it's a date.

05:04.595 --> 05:06.014
See you then.
- Okay.

05:06.097 --> 05:09.559
- What did you say to him?
- Oh, my gosh, you guys, I--

05:09.642 --> 05:13.896
- Did you serve Zach Barnes
or did you soft serve him?

05:13.980 --> 05:16.482
- That was Zach Barnes
as in Cobra Captain

05:16.566 --> 05:20.028
and star linebacker Zach Barnes?
- The very same.

05:20.111 --> 05:22.196
You'll be seeing a lot of old
Barnesy come Saturday night.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.198
You know--when he's
tackling you.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.408
- I didn't know it was him.

05:25.491 --> 05:28.036
I guess I've never seen
him without a helmet.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.454
And he isn't even
wearing a jersey.

05:29.537 --> 05:33.624
- What a fool. Now he'll have
to pay for his ice cream.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.544
- Yeah, what a fool.
[laughing]

05:36.627 --> 05:39.422
- Yeah, that's what
I just said.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.804
- [gasping]
Hey, you guys.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.848
Something kind of crazy happened
and I need your advice

05:48.931 --> 05:51.267
now that you're here. Is that
toothpaste on your cheek?

05:51.350 --> 05:52.560
- Yep, I heard it works on zits.

05:52.643 --> 05:57.023
- Well, if it doesn't,
nemezit will have fresh breath.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.859
- You were saying?

05:59.942 --> 06:01.736
- A guy asked me to the dance.
His name is Zach.

06:01.819 --> 06:04.614
He's tall and cute
and he likes my smack talk.

06:04.697 --> 06:07.784
Did I mention he's really cute?
- That's awesome!

06:07.867 --> 06:08.618
- That's cool!

06:08.701 --> 06:10.495
- But he's a Cobra.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.580
- PEPPER &amp; SOPHIE:
Wha-a-a-at?

06:12.663 --> 06:16.209
- It's his one flaw,
his one tiny, little...

06:16.292 --> 06:19.253
huge flaw.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.255
- Bella, you can't
date the enemy.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.174
- But, you guys...

06:23.257 --> 06:24.509
there was a spark.

06:24.592 --> 06:28.554
- Yeah, a spark that will burn
down the whole school.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.848
- Ooh, this is so romantic.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.601
You're gonna be involved
in a tragic love fire.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.103
- So you think it's
a good idea.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.313
- Well...no.

06:37.396 --> 06:38.481
- It's a terrible idea.

06:38.564 --> 06:41.275
And I think the whole school
would agree with us.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.277
Plus, what if
the team finds out?

06:43.361 --> 06:46.489
- Yeah, you're right.
What was I thinking?

06:46.572 --> 06:48.491
I've gotta go.
- Is that a mum for Sophie?

06:48.574 --> 06:51.327
- It is. My stepmom Brenda
helped me pick it out.

06:51.410 --> 06:53.329
She's really good at buying
showing things

06:53.412 --> 06:54.330
with my father's money.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.125
At least, that's what
my mother says.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.835
- It must be fancy.
- Yeah.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.420
It's got lots of
bells and whistles--literally.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.421
Plus, it's got lights

07:02.505 --> 07:05.174
and a little stuffed dog
that barks to music.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.759
Just enough without
going overboard.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.428
- There are a few things in this
world that just ain't natural--

07:09.512 --> 07:11.055
cheese from a can
and a mum from a store.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.684
That's why my mum is growing
in my garden as we speak.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.102
I'm waiting till tomorrow to
cut it so it's fresh,

07:16.185 --> 07:18.980
and it'll be mixed with
daisies--her favorite flower.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.566
- Wait, Sawyer, did you just say
you're giving someone a mum?

07:21.649 --> 07:23.609
- Yes. Yes, I am.
[chuckling]

07:23.693 --> 07:26.988
- Well, aren't you full
of surprises, buster.

07:27.071 --> 07:28.322
Who's the lucky lady?

07:28.406 --> 07:30.992
- Let's just say that's
a surprise, too.

07:31.075 --> 07:35.371
- [sighing]
That cowboy is a man of mystery.

07:35.454 --> 07:36.372
Oh, hey, Sophie.

07:36.455 --> 07:38.875
So, I know we discussed
this verbally

07:38.958 --> 07:41.169
and via text and email
and you said "No."

07:41.252 --> 07:43.796
But I was thinking, if you saw
it in person you might say--

07:43.880 --> 07:45.173
- No.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.216
- Okay, clearly I was mistaken.

07:47.300 --> 07:51.220
Catch ya later, Soph.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.180
Hey, Pepper.
- Hey.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.223
- Everything okay?

07:54.307 --> 07:55.975
- Not really.

07:56.058 --> 08:00.396
I was hoping a certain someone
was going to give me a mum.

08:00.479 --> 08:01.147
But it looks like
it's not going to happen.

08:01.230 --> 08:04.108
[sighing]

08:04.192 --> 08:05.651
- Yes, it is.
Full disclosure.

08:05.735 --> 08:06.944
I bought this with
Sophie in mind,

08:07.028 --> 08:09.739
but she wasn't accepting
gifts at the moment.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.657
Pepper, my good pal,
will you accept my mum

08:11.741 --> 08:15.119
and go to the dance with me?

08:15.203 --> 08:18.497
- Sure, Newt.
I'd be happy to.

08:18.581 --> 08:19.916
- Oh, by the way,
if you get hungry,

08:19.999 --> 08:22.627
it's got edible petals.
[nibbling]

08:28.007 --> 08:29.342
- Oh, hey.

08:29.425 --> 08:30.593
- Oh, hey, I got your text.
What's up?

08:30.676 --> 08:33.095
- I wanted to talk to
you about Saturday.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.015
I think you're really cool,
but I don't think we can go out.

08:36.097 --> 08:37.099
- Why not?

08:37.183 --> 08:39.434
- Because you're the enemy
and I don't want to

08:39.519 --> 08:42.270
burn down the school
in a tragic love fire.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.313
I mean...

08:43.397 --> 08:45.691
I'm a Bulldog
and you're a Cobra.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.652
We're at war.
We can't do this.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.071
- Look, I knew who you were
when I asked you out,

08:50.154 --> 08:51.447
and I didn't care,
so why should you?

08:51.530 --> 08:54.200
- Because it's more
complicated for me.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.618
- Because of the love fire?

08:55.701 --> 08:58.788
- No. Because I'm the only

Newt, you're a genius!

some of the credit, too.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.030
- Hey, Bella, you okay?

19:58.113 --> 19:59.364
- Guess I was wrong
about Zach.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.784
- Yeah, well, I warned
you about dating a Cobra.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.328
- It's not that.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.413
I'd get it if Zach couldn't
handle dating the enemy,

20:06.496 --> 20:07.456
but what really hurts
is he couldn't handle

20:07.539 --> 20:09.875
dating a girl who's
better than him.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.501
- Yeah, well, you'd
better get used to it.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.670
You're pretty much
better than everybody.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.797
- Great! That means
I'll be alone forever!

20:15.881 --> 20:18.634
- No, it means you're awesome.
You kick butt.

gonna find somebody

20:20.802 --> 20:21.970

that about you.

- Wow. Thanks, Troy.

20:25.349 --> 20:28.018
Looks like I'm going
solo to the dance.

20:28.101 --> 20:29.686
Oh, well...

- Hey, how about
you go with me?

20:31.188 --> 20:34.066
- What about all your ladies?
Won't they be disappointed?

20:34.149 --> 20:36.777
- [sighing]
Yeah, they will.

20:36.860 --> 20:37.986
But, you know, I'll save
a ton on gift baskets.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.697

20:40.781 --> 20:43.492

all been waiting for.

20:43.575 --> 20:46.912
- Oh, that's us.
- Let's go.

Oh, yeah. You, too, Bella.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.896
Nice crown.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.190
- Yeah, I was hoping
it would be bigger.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.858
Shall we go to the dance,
Your Highness?

21:16.942 --> 21:19.736
- We shall, Your Majesty.
Let's hang.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.489
- Okay, but I'm keeping
it casual.

I can wake up

21:28.829 --> 21:31.081

ice cream nightmare.

is almost over,

and by the time you go home
and get your jerseys,

21:38.338 --> 21:39.548
it'll be too late.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.050
- Oh, well, then it's a good
thing we brought 'em.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.552
- Great.

21:43.635 --> 21:46.263

one for me and one for my date.
