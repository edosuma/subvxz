Previously on “Boston Legal”…

00:02.400 --> 00:05.060
Oh, you think you'll win.
$50,000 says you won't.

00:05.100 --> 00:06.360
I'm not going to bet you.

00:06.400 --> 00:07.360
You know you'll lose.

00:07.400 --> 00:08.160
I won't lose.

00:08.200 --> 00:10.500
$50,000.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.260
He's out of control.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.500
Your industry
is out of control.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.360
You've bitten off more than you
can chew this time, my friend.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.560
Oh, I don't swallow.
I just chew up and spit out.

00:17.600 --> 00:18.400
We'll see.

00:18.400 --> 00:22.800
I know exactly how big
and powerful you are, Mr Mathis.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.060
It might do you some good
to check me out.

00:25.100 --> 00:27.212
–You're losing.
–I'm not losing.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.644
Oh, yes, you're losing.
Double it?

00:30.000 --> 00:30.700
Fine.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.500
Is it not red?

00:39.900 --> 00:41.360
They're always red
in the morning.

00:41.400 --> 00:42.000
See?

00:42.000 --> 00:44.160
You stay out of this. I know
salmonella when I've got it.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.200
Excuse me.

00:46.300 --> 00:47.860
Uh, my—my name's
jason Canfield.

00:47.900 --> 00:49.060
I'm looking for Mr Poole.

00:49.100 --> 00:52.060
Ah, well, Mr Poole is not,
uh, here at the moment.

00:52.100 --> 00:53.760
Or there, for that matter.
May I help you?

00:53.800 --> 00:56.660
Well, I was just passing by
your building and saw the sign,

00:56.700 --> 00:57.660
and I need a lawyer.

00:57.700 --> 01:01.600
So… how about Crane?
–Uh, Mr Crane is fun.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.460
You can always talk about him
when he's in the room,

01:03.500 --> 01:06.760
which is a nice, but I don't
think he's your man either.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.000
So that leaves Schmidt.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.510
I'm Schmidt.
Let's go to my office.

01:12.700 --> 01:15.660
Why wouldn't he ask for me?
Am I not the star of this show?

01:15.700 --> 01:17.060
You see your name up there?

01:17.100 --> 01:19.260
This is not about
how good you are.

01:19.300 --> 01:20.000
It's not?

01:20.000 --> 01:23.360
It's all about credit. That's
what's important in life.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.000
Credit.

01:24.000 --> 01:24.460
And money.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.260
I thought it was
all about getting the girl.

01:26.300 --> 01:28.960
Tell me it's values, Carl. It's about
getting the girl, right? Money.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
–Money.
–Sex.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.500
–Money.
–Sex. –You call it.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.860
–Maybe it's money and sex.
–They go together.

01:34.900 --> 01:35.660
One begets the other.

01:35.700 --> 01:38.274
See? We're not fighting.
We're in sync.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.360
I can't be sure, but I think
Carl wants to be in sync, too.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.400
Was he killed in Iraq?

02:20.800 --> 02:24.260
No, no. They patched him up
okay there, brought him back.

02:24.300 --> 02:27.600
He died in a hospital here.
The doctor killed him.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.160
But I know for a fact
that there was malpractice,

02:31.200 --> 02:32.718
because he admitted it.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.060
Mr Canfield,
I've tried a number

02:35.100 --> 02:37.060
of medical malpractice
cases in my time.

02:37.100 --> 02:39.060
I've yet to run
across a doctor

02:39.100 --> 02:40.660
who admitted
his or her wrongdoing.

02:40.700 --> 02:42.600
Yeah, but this one did.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.060
It—but I can't sue,

02:44.100 --> 02:45.760
because it happened
in a military hospital.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.060
Something called
the Feres doctrine.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.160
You heard of that?

02:48.200 --> 02:49.900
Yes it—it basically

02:49.900 --> 02:52.960
insulates military hospitals
and their staffs from lawsuits

02:53.000 --> 02:55.376
when the victims
are on active duty.

02:55.900 --> 02:58.960
My brother's not on active duty
anymore, Ms Schmidt.

02:59.000 --> 02:59.900
He's dead.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.872
I'm afraid the doctrine
would still apply.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.942
So there's…
there's nothing I can do?

03:09.400 --> 03:10.300
Nothing?

03:13.400 --> 03:14.200
Well…

03:14.700 --> 03:16.660
But the law is clear.
Soldiers are—

03:16.700 --> 03:18.100
Alan, I-I know.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.860
It's completely unwinnable. It
doesn't even make sense to try.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.400
Which is why
I've come to you.

03:23.500 --> 03:27.460
I've so missed watching the
brave knight fight the windmill.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.560
Shirley, this lawsuit
is barred.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.660
There's a supreme court case
directly on point,

03:33.700 --> 03:37.060
and it's not like you to want
to waste the firm's money.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.200
What's going on?

03:40.100 --> 03:43.160
What's going on is,
when a man comes in off the street

03:43.200 --> 03:45.260
whose only brother
has been wrongfully killed

03:45.300 --> 03:47.300
and asks you for your help,

03:48.600 --> 03:49.400
you help.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.400
It's that simple.
You help.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.646
Would it be
the Pentagon, then?

03:59.100 --> 04:01.500
Well, it… it might.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.060
Are you close,
you and your sister?

04:07.100 --> 04:09.608
Well, mainly,
she'd throw rocks at me.

04:10.000 --> 04:10.800
Got it.

04:10.800 --> 04:14.800
She was a bit overbearing
and… and extremely punctual.

04:14.800 --> 04:15.760
She should be here any—

04:15.800 --> 04:16.500
Hi.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.010
Hi. What are you doing
on the desk?

04:20.300 --> 04:22.660
Joy Espenson. Get down.
Are you his girlfriend?

04:22.700 --> 04:23.900
No, I just—

04:23.900 --> 04:26.012
You're just what,
purely sexual?

04:26.600 --> 04:30.100
Joy! This is Katie Lloyd,
my colleague, a lawyer.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.900
You apologize this instant.

04:31.900 --> 04:32.800
Okay.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.360
I'm here about
your nephew Henry.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.960
I have concerns.
I need your help.

04:37.000 --> 04:37.860
What concerns?

04:37.900 --> 04:40.060
Well, he's 15.
He's going through puberty.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.760
He's starting to get
an acute interest in sex.

04:41.800 --> 04:42.660
Isn't that natural?

04:42.700 --> 04:44.812
And he may be dating
his sister.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.100
What?

04:46.100 --> 04:46.660
You heard me.

04:46.700 --> 04:47.760
But he's an only child.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.660
Well, he is or he isn't.
We don't know.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.860
He was conceived by
an anonymous sperm donor.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.660
I have an excellent sex life
so long as men

04:53.700 --> 04:56.160
don't actually have to get
in the bedroom with me.

04:56.200 --> 05:00.000
Anyway, turns out Fiona,
that's the girlfriend Fiona

05:00.000 --> 05:02.660
she was conceived
by an anonymous sperm donor.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.560
It also turns out she's
the spitting image of Henry.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.960
I'm thinking, what are the odds?
Are you with me?

05:08.000 --> 05:08.560
To be honest,

05:08.600 --> 05:10.260
I'm still recovering
from the gripping apology.

05:10.300 --> 05:13.666
I met Fiona's mother.
We both used the same agency.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.000
My God, what if?

05:16.200 --> 05:19.260
I mean, what if they
fall in love and get married

05:19.300 --> 05:20.752
and start reproducing?

05:21.200 --> 05:23.160
W-well, let's simply take
DNA swabs and—

05:23.200 --> 05:26.000
DNA is not conclusive
with half siblings.

05:27.700 --> 05:28.660
Could you speak to him?

05:28.700 --> 05:29.400
Me?

05:29.400 --> 05:30.900
He loves you.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.020
Does she ever speak?

05:45.400 --> 05:47.460
I must say, when I first
read the complaint,

05:47.500 --> 05:48.460
I couldn't decide

05:48.500 --> 05:51.160
whether it was just laughable
or nonsensical.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.860
Now that I see
who the attorney is,

05:52.900 --> 05:55.400
it makes sense
that it's laughable.

05:55.800 --> 05:56.960
Wade and I go back.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.660
He represents the
pharmaceutical companies

05:58.700 --> 05:59.760
that almost killed Denny.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.960
How's that discovery going,
by the way?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.160
It might be
proceeding more quickly

06:03.200 --> 06:06.760
if I wasn't sidetracked by baseless,
groundless, frivolous claims.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.660
He's a big fan
of adjectives.

06:08.700 --> 06:11.160
Yes, I go back a little bit
with wade as well.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.200
Really?

06:12.300 --> 06:14.760
The hospital has admitted
comtting gross misconduct,

06:14.800 --> 06:16.660
which caused
the victim's death.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.960
But it's a military hospital.
They're immune.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.360
Fine. We have the merits, you
have the legal technicalities.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.660
Let's meet somewhere
in the middle.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.560
The technicality here
is the trump card.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.600
The supreme court
clearly held

06:27.600 --> 06:30.560
you can't touch military
hospitals. Game over.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.160
That ruling was 50 years ago.
Things change.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.400
Things change?

06:35.100 --> 06:37.160
Will that be your
legal argument, things change?

06:37.200 --> 06:39.260
I'll have you know, tony scalia
is personal friend of mine,

06:39.300 --> 06:41.760
and trust me, he has
no interest whatsoever

06:41.800 --> 06:44.260
in what any supreme court
before him has said.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.260
I don't know why I even
bothered to come over here.

06:46.300 --> 06:48.016
Because you miss me, Wade.

06:48.500 --> 06:51.160
Hug? We're a nation
of huggers, you know?

06:51.200 --> 06:52.982
We will take this to court.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.700
Fine. Do that.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.100
Have a lovely day.

07:01.100 --> 07:01.600
What?

07:01.600 --> 07:05.296
We don't really want it to end
quickly, do we? He's fun.

07:08.900 --> 07:11.600
I certainly understand
your concerns.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.360
But we have
contractual agreements

07:13.400 --> 07:15.060
assuring
absolute confidentiality

07:15.100 --> 07:16.560
with all of our
anonymous donors.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.460
He could be dating
his sister.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.300
Joy.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.160
I appreciate
your legal obligations,

07:22.200 --> 07:24.960
but contracts can be vitiated
on grounds of public policy.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.560
And your public policy
argument would be what?

07:27.600 --> 07:29.060
He's dating his sister!

07:29.100 --> 07:29.900
Joy.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.400
Are these your children?
–Yes, they are.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.348
You have a beautiful family.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.844
I can see they
even look like you.

07:42.300 --> 07:45.200
Henry Espenson wonders
whom he looks like.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.640
Do you really think it's fair,
Mr Chism,

07:48.800 --> 07:50.860
that Henry's right to know
his genetic lineage

07:50.900 --> 07:54.400
was simply…
contracted away from him?

07:54.400 --> 07:57.800
Mr Espenson, without
assurance of anonymity,

07:57.800 --> 07:59.460
many sperm donors
wouldn't donate.

07:59.500 --> 08:01.560
It's possible Henry
might not even exist.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.760
And if we were to look
at the equation

08:02.800 --> 08:04.760
as best interest
of the sperm donor,

08:04.800 --> 08:07.200
I'd side with you,
but since courts

08:07.200 --> 08:09.260
typically opt for
best interest of the child—

08:09.300 --> 08:11.742
And Henry would be
better off unborn?

08:12.200 --> 08:15.360
Believe me, Mr Espenson,
I've heard all the arguments.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.360
And as I said,
I do sympathize,

08:17.400 --> 08:19.760
but there is no wiggle
room on this one.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.300
We will not tell you
who the sperm donor is.

08:38.799 --> 08:43.200
All right, listen, buddy,
I've tried to play nice here,

08:43.200 --> 08:45.560
but if we have to go
to court, I'll do it.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.460
I'll close your doors,
and then you can liquidate

08:48.500 --> 08:50.400
all your little test tubes

08:50.400 --> 08:52.760
and turkey basters,
your porn videos.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.960
See this here?
It's a cigarette, bub.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.460
And you can put it out
like this,

08:56.500 --> 08:58.600
just snuff it in an ashtray,

08:58.600 --> 09:01.700
or I can stomp it with
my size-13 boats.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.760
Either way,
it's extinguished, pal.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.860
Whether you want to be snuffed,
stomped or sucked dry,

09:06.900 --> 09:08.860
we can do it nice,
do it rough.

09:08.900 --> 09:10.100
How's gonna be?

09:11.800 --> 09:12.600
Just…

09:15.800 --> 09:17.300
Yes, security, please.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.460
I am not being a traitor.
I'm supporting our troops.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.260
Why aren't you?

09:27.300 --> 09:30.300
Isn't this war
costing us enough

09:30.300 --> 09:32.160
without the lawyers
coming in—

09:32.200 --> 09:33.360
Oh, I don't want
to get into this.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.560
Alan, I'm gonna
tell you something

09:34.600 --> 09:38.600
and you need to hear this—
America is sick of Bush bashing.

09:38.600 --> 09:39.360
Enough already.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.900
I'm not bashing Bush.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.760
You're suing the military,
which is the Pentagon,

09:42.800 --> 09:44.960
which is the government,
which is Bush.

09:45.000 --> 09:45.760
It all comes down to Bush.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.360
Denny, this isn't about Bush.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.760
This is about the troops
risking their lives in the—

09:49.800 --> 09:51.100
Oh, please.

09:51.100 --> 09:53.060
After the debacle
at Walter Reed,

09:53.100 --> 09:54.260
you must be kidding.

09:54.300 --> 09:57.060
These kids are returning
with catastrophic wounds.

09:57.100 --> 10:00.994
Who the hell is looking out
for them, really? Not Congress.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.414
It's one you can't win, Alan.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.400
Says who?

10:04.700 --> 10:05.600
Says law.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.960
Says the United States
supreme court.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.700
Says $50,000.

10:09.700 --> 10:11.218
You know what? I don't…

10:15.200 --> 10:16.160
You want to bet.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.760
Uh-huh. If you insist
on being an idiot,

10:18.800 --> 10:21.000
at least let me
profit from it.

10:21.900 --> 10:24.300
Have you no shame
whatsoever?

10:24.300 --> 10:25.000
None.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.200
All proceeds
go to the troops.

10:29.200 --> 10:29.800
Fine.

10:30.600 --> 10:31.300
Fine.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.300
Fine.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.800
There are reasons for
this doctrine, Ms Schmidt.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.600
Yes, your honor, bad ones.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.500
These kids fight our wars.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.460
It's an undue burden
to compensate them

10:57.500 --> 11:00.160
when they're victims
of medical malpractice?

11:00.200 --> 11:01.260
The soldier in question

11:01.300 --> 11:03.460
lost his life because
of an avoidable,

11:03.500 --> 11:05.500
negligent hospital screwup—

11:05.500 --> 11:06.660
It's not just the money.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.960
Subjecting the military
hospitals to discovery—

11:09.000 --> 11:09.800
Oh, come on.

11:09.800 --> 11:10.360
May I finish?

11:10.400 --> 11:11.560
You didn't let me finish.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.960
Your honor,
this goes beyond bad faith.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.460
We send these kids to war,
they come back

11:16.500 --> 11:17.860
in need of medical care,

11:17.900 --> 11:20.360
our doctors commit
malpractice, and we tell them,

11:20.400 --> 11:22.960
“oops. You can't sue
because of a-a doctrine

11:23.000 --> 11:26.060
that selectively singles out
and punishes soldiers”?

11:26.100 --> 11:27.660
I thought he was
the speech maker.

11:27.700 --> 11:28.960
No, today you got me.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.100
At least let me call
a witness or two.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.600
My client lost
his only brother.

11:35.900 --> 11:38.900
If he can't have
his day in court,

11:40.100 --> 11:41.900
at least give him an hour.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.760
All right. I'll allow you
to call witnesses

11:46.800 --> 11:49.200
as to the legality
of the doctrine.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.860
Your honor,
if she doesn't like the law,

11:50.900 --> 11:53.560
her recourse is the legislature,
not a judge.

11:53.600 --> 11:58.300
Well, thank you, Mr Mathis.
I know what my role is.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.100
2:00.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.560
You started sucking
on the cigarette?

12:06.600 --> 12:07.660
I-I think I got
some wood fibers

12:07.700 --> 12:09.300
lodged in my lungs.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.460
Well, wh-what happened?

12:12.500 --> 12:14.860
Well… I just saw
my sister looking at me

12:14.900 --> 12:18.464
like I was this big loser,
the way she did growing up.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.960
Did she really
throw rocks at you?

12:20.000 --> 12:20.500
Yes.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.660
She thought if a hard object
came hurtling at my head,

12:22.700 --> 12:25.460
I'd have to lift my hands
off my thighs to block it.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.900
She does love me in her way,
but her way sucks.

12:32.600 --> 12:33.392
It's a prop.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.760
So what happens now
with the case?

12:36.800 --> 12:40.430
Well, we go to court, but first,
we have to tell Henry.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.360
How can I help?

12:41.400 --> 12:44.200
You can't really.
I need to do this.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.200
Can you?

12:49.600 --> 12:50.800
It's a prop.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.760
Sometimes
I think about retiring,

12:59.800 --> 13:01.120
but what would I do?

13:01.900 --> 13:04.260
I hate golf.
I don't much like to travel.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.478
Do you ever
think about retiring?

13:06.700 --> 13:07.600
Not really,

13:08.400 --> 13:11.260
as long as I can practice law
on my own terms.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.752
And you're doing that?

13:14.100 --> 13:17.862
Still able to put your judgments
in question form, I see.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.560
You know, Shirley,

13:20.600 --> 13:23.400
I'm still on the board
of bar overseers.

13:24.200 --> 13:27.800
There's a lot of talk
about your firm lately.

13:28.900 --> 13:29.700
Is there?

13:29.900 --> 13:31.900
Yes, regarding its, uh…

13:32.900 --> 13:34.000
slide.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.400
I wasn't aware
of any slide.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.560
Two of your name partners
have lost their minds,

13:40.600 --> 13:41.900
and you…

13:42.400 --> 13:44.100
What about me?

13:44.600 --> 13:47.160
I've known you a long time.
May I be brutally honest?

13:47.200 --> 13:48.300
Oh, please.

13:48.300 --> 13:51.402
This Alan Shore is
dragging you into the sewer.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.860
It's now his thumbprints
all over Crane, Poole & Schmidt,

13:54.900 --> 13:56.100
not yours.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.700
He's unscrupulous,

13:57.700 --> 13:59.760
he's disrespectful
to our judiciary,

13:59.800 --> 14:01.000
he's a bad seed,

14:02.100 --> 14:03.400
and his reputation…

14:04.600 --> 14:08.900
is running to your firm
as a whole, to you.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.460
I see his influence in play
in—in this very case.

14:11.500 --> 14:14.460
You brought a baseless,
frivolous cause of acion

14:14.500 --> 14:16.600
barred by law.
Why?

14:18.700 --> 14:20.000
Are you done?

14:20.500 --> 14:23.140
Go ahead. Let me have it.
I'm a big boy.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.860
I've practiced a long time,
worked with some of

14:29.900 --> 14:31.760
the highest-ranking members
of our profession—

14:31.800 --> 14:33.500
I include you among them—

14:33.800 --> 14:35.560
But I have yet
to be associated

14:35.600 --> 14:39.600
with a more skilled,
more principled,

14:40.100 --> 14:43.100
more noble attorney
than Alan Shore.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.960
If his is the reputation
I'm to be saddled with,

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
I will take it.
And lunch is over.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.760
If you want to reject
my opinion,

14:54.800 --> 14:56.700
that's your prerogative.

14:56.700 --> 15:01.000
But here's a fact:
he is putting your firm in peril.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.912
Believe me
when I tell you that.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.760
Jerry, thank you so much
for helping me tell him.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.560
I'm just so afraid
if he hears it from me,

15:23.600 --> 15:25.400
he'll hate my guts forever.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.400
Hey, mom.
Hi, uncle Jerry.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.700
Henry! Hello. Welcome.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.984
This could take a while.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.260
It's so good
to see you.

15:36.300 --> 15:39.000
You, too.
This is my girlfriend Fiona.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.260
I brought her along,
if that's okay.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.100
We're kind of inseparable.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.360
So what's the big mystery? Did I
inherit money or something?

15:50.400 --> 15:51.360
Did my birth father keel?

15:51.400 --> 15:52.500
Henry.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.982
So really,
what's the deal?

15:57.000 --> 16:00.700
Let's… go into the conference
room where we all can sit.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.260
Are you currently serving
in the military, sir?

16:10.300 --> 16:13.072
No, I'm a retired captain
for the US army.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.460
I served until last year.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.360
And what were your
primary responsibilities?

16:17.400 --> 16:20.360
For the last nine years,
I was mainly in recruiting,

16:20.400 --> 16:21.960
getting young men to enlist.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.760
Did you retire on good terms?

16:23.800 --> 16:24.900
Not so much.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.352
Could you tell us why?

16:26.500 --> 16:30.900
Well… it was suggested I retire
after I was a little too outspoken

16:30.900 --> 16:33.060
on what I perceived
as a backdoor draft.

16:33.100 --> 16:35.400
Um, when you say
“backdoor draft”—

16:35.400 --> 16:37.600
I mean we target the poor.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.260
No one likes to say it publicly,
but that's what we do.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.600
And you target
low-income youth because?

16:43.600 --> 16:45.460
They needed the money.
Most kids don't want

16:45.500 --> 16:47.860
to go off and fight wars
if they can avoid it,

16:47.900 --> 16:50.060
so we hone in on the kids
without options.

16:50.100 --> 16:51.100
The poor.

16:51.300 --> 16:54.060
The poor. We set up
our recruitment stations

16:54.100 --> 16:56.860
in the poor neighborhood malls
and in the poor high schools.

16:56.900 --> 16:58.200
I'm sorry.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.560
Can you at least tell me
the connection to this case?

17:00.600 --> 17:03.100
It goes to fairness,
Mr Mathis.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.660
We go after the lowest
economic demographic

17:05.700 --> 17:07.560
in our society
to fight our wars.

17:07.599 --> 17:11.260
These kids are risking their
lives out of financial duress.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.060
They have—
–I'm sorry, Ms Schmidt.

17:13.099 --> 17:15.900
This is an entirely
different issue.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.760
This witness is disallowed.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.260
Your honor, I would like you to
understand the context of this—

17:20.300 --> 17:22.060
No. We're gonna stay on issue.

17:22.099 --> 17:24.960
Now if you've got a witness
who can talk about this case

17:25.000 --> 17:27.260
or the doctrine itself,
I'll listen.

17:27.300 --> 17:30.600
Otherwise, this witness
is disallowed.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.300
Now who else do you have?

17:32.300 --> 17:34.260
Yes, I would like to hear
from the doctor

17:34.300 --> 17:35.960
who treated
my client's brother.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.960
Defense stipulated that he
committed an avoidable error

17:39.000 --> 17:41.310
rising to the level
of malpractice.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.860
I'd like to hear from him
all the same since—

17:42.900 --> 17:45.400
There's no point here
from the doctor

17:45.400 --> 17:47.260
unless you're trying
to manipulate me

17:47.300 --> 17:50.660
with either horror or emotion,
neither of which informs us

17:50.700 --> 17:52.000
of the legitimacy

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
or the lawfulness
of the Feres doctrine.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.260
Your honor, certainly you're
allowed to be horrified

17:57.300 --> 17:58.360
by the facts in this case.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.800
The doctor is disallowed.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.460
In order to fully appreciate
this doctrine

18:03.500 --> 18:05.360
and its capricious
application,

18:05.400 --> 18:06.660
your honor needs to hear test—

18:06.700 --> 18:07.560
Oh, wait a minute.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.260
You've—you've wasted
enough of my time already.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.100
I'd like to hear summations
from counsel

18:13.100 --> 18:15.600
in this court
tomorrow at 10:00 am,

18:15.600 --> 18:17.100
and then I'll rule.

18:17.300 --> 18:20.996
In the meantime, I'd like to see
counsel in my chambers.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.000
Well…

18:27.100 --> 18:29.900
It, um, uh, might be… best

18:29.900 --> 18:33.100
if this conversation were—
were private.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.760
Mom, whatever it is,
I'm gonna tell Fiona.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.054
She's my soul mate.

18:37.800 --> 18:38.800
Okay.

18:40.000 --> 18:40.700
Well…

18:42.700 --> 18:44.100
The thing is, Henry…

18:48.000 --> 18:48.600
Tell him.

18:50.900 --> 18:52.900
Well, Henry, hello.
Welcome.

18:52.900 --> 18:56.060
This is a little bit about
your birth father, actually.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.560
–Did he croak?
–No. No, no, no.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.360
Well, we have no way of knowing
one way or another

18:59.400 --> 19:01.360
since we have no idea
who he even is.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.060
Fiona's a sperm-donor baby too.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.160
It's one of the first things
we bonded over.

19:05.200 --> 19:09.200
Yes, in fact, you're not
just sperm-donor babies.

19:09.200 --> 19:13.800
But you both come from
the same sperm bank, actually.

19:13.800 --> 19:14.600
Really?

19:15.600 --> 19:19.200
Cool. You see?
We're so much alike.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.960
M-more alike
than you might imagine.

19:21.000 --> 19:26.300
It's possible… you came
from the same sperm donor.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.360
What do you mean?

19:28.400 --> 19:29.400
Well…

19:30.600 --> 19:33.600
You may have…

19:36.400 --> 19:37.300
Um…

19:39.400 --> 19:41.500
The same birth father.

19:42.300 --> 19:43.660
The odds are against it,
of course,

19:43.700 --> 19:46.700
but there's a wee chance that…

19:49.100 --> 19:50.800
uh, Fiona…

19:51.800 --> 19:52.900
is…

19:55.400 --> 19:57.600
your half sister.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.500
That—it can't be.

20:02.500 --> 20:06.200
I-I—I'm sure it isn't,
but, uh, um, it might be.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.900
How can we know… for sure?

20:11.900 --> 20:15.100
Well… that's the thing.

20:15.100 --> 20:18.100
Uh, we… can't.

20:18.100 --> 20:20.900
We're trying, but so far…

20:22.000 --> 20:23.500
We can't.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.800
I have been informed…

20:35.800 --> 20:39.800
that counsel has been
wagering on this case.

20:39.900 --> 20:41.200
Is that true?

20:43.400 --> 20:45.400
That is absolutely false.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.800
Mr Shore…

20:47.800 --> 20:49.600
What about you?
–Me?

20:49.600 --> 20:50.260
I've been informed

20:50.300 --> 20:55.400
that you and Denny Crane
have a side bet for $50,000.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.700
Is that true?

20:59.200 --> 21:01.700
–Well…
–Alan?

21:04.800 --> 21:06.516
Proceeds go to the troops.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.160
I never bet on baseball,
and I bet we'd win here,

21:09.200 --> 21:11.360
so it's not as if
I'm throwing anything here.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.700
But a senior partner
in your firm—

21:14.700 --> 21:17.560
Denny and I have these
little side bets all the time.

21:17.600 --> 21:21.600
It's not like…
that answer remotely helped me.

21:22.100 --> 21:23.460
I lied about that actually.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.760
Denny and I don't bet all the time.

21:25.800 --> 21:29.400
I never bet. I just… lie.

21:29.400 --> 21:32.766
My therapist recommends
that I lie to get past the…

21:34.100 --> 21:35.060
gambling problem.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.360
Well, I'm recommending you for disbarment

21:37.400 --> 21:39.360
as soon as this case is through.

21:39.400 --> 21:43.200
All right. Summation,
10:00 am tomorrow.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.600
–You told the judge?
–What?

22:03.600 --> 22:05.160
About our bet. You told the judge.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.000
I did no such thing.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.360
Well, he knows, Denny.
How would he know?

22:08.400 --> 22:09.160
Don't ask me.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.460
You never said anything to anybody?

22:11.500 --> 22:14.960
Well, I-I might have mentioned
it to the clerk in passing.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.300
–I don't believe it.
–Calm down.

22:17.300 --> 22:19.700
You sabotaged a case of this firm

22:19.700 --> 22:22.260
so you could win a bet?
You sabotaged me.

22:22.300 --> 22:25.060
–Keep your voice down.
–I will not keep my voice down.

22:25.100 --> 22:27.060
You sold me out.
I'm up for disbarment now.

22:27.100 --> 22:28.660
You might be, too.
–I'll make a few calls.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.900
Denny, we wagered on a case.

22:30.900 --> 22:34.000
Do you have any idea
how unethical that is?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.060
Well, it's not like
we bet on baseball.

22:36.100 --> 22:39.200
You did this to me,
to your best friend.

22:39.200 --> 22:43.200
Winning a bet is… My God.

22:48.600 --> 22:49.460
She looks mad.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.900
Of all the things
you have done…

22:51.900 --> 22:54.300
never mind the illegality of it,

22:54.300 --> 22:56.400
the insensitivity…

22:56.400 --> 22:58.500
A soldier lost his life.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.100
–Shirley—
–There is no excuse, Alan.

23:01.100 --> 23:03.100
I wasn't about to offer any.

23:03.100 --> 23:04.760
It was stupid.
We never should have done it.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.660
If I thought it would have any
bearing on the case, I never w—

23:07.700 --> 23:09.500
Of course it has bearing.

23:09.500 --> 23:12.160
The judge now takes our case
much less seriously bec—

23:12.200 --> 23:13.560
Which was obviously Denny's plan,

23:13.600 --> 23:14.560
which is why he told the clerk.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.100
Oh, sure. Sell me out.

23:16.100 --> 23:18.900
You sold me out.
You betrayed me.

23:18.900 --> 23:21.500
You both betrayed me…

23:21.500 --> 23:24.000
and this firm and the client.

23:27.800 --> 23:30.600
You sicken me, both of you.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.160
Maybe I shouldn't have told.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.700
Maybe⁈

23:40.100 --> 23:42.100
You risked everything.

23:42.100 --> 23:46.100
Our friendship, our trust,
our nights on the balcony—

23:46.600 --> 23:48.860
You put a stupid bet before it all.

23:48.900 --> 23:50.360
I mean—you know what?
I don't care.

23:50.400 --> 23:53.000
I'm done. We're done.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.400
–Alan.
–I can't even look at you.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.560
So this isn't any kind of
in vitro facility or—

24:06.600 --> 24:08.160
No, your honor.
It's simply a bank.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.660
People buy and sell sperm.

24:09.700 --> 24:11.560
And do people buy and sell
a lot of it,

24:11.600 --> 24:14.960
or has the weakened American dollar
taken its toll there as well?

24:15.000 --> 24:17.860
Your honor, I certainly hope
you're not finding humor in this.

24:17.900 --> 24:20.260
The consequences here
are potentially dire.

24:20.300 --> 24:23.560
Look, the odds of two people from
the same donor meeting are—

24:23.600 --> 24:25.000
Not preposterous.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.460
Many donors donate buckets
of sperm over time.

24:27.500 --> 24:30.260
In fact, with designer babies
and genetic engineering

24:30.300 --> 24:32.660
being the new must-have
for wealthy families,

24:32.700 --> 24:34.560
many prospective parents
go looking for

24:34.600 --> 24:37.960
that athletic good-looking man
with the ivy league degree.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.160
There are some donors

24:39.200 --> 24:43.100
who have sired more offspring
than secretariat.

24:43.100 --> 24:44.560
It's only a matter of time

24:44.600 --> 24:48.000
before two people from
the same seed hook up.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.560
Crown cryobank follows
the guidelines recommended by

24:50.600 --> 24:52.960
the American society
for reproductive medicine

24:53.000 --> 24:56.160
to specifically guard against
the possibility of consanguinity.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.500
But it can happen.

24:57.500 --> 25:00.360
Looking at these two kids,
you can see the possibility.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.560
Your honor, if I may,

25:01.600 --> 25:03.960
we limit the number of
live births per donor

25:04.000 --> 25:07.400
to 25 per population of 800,000.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.960
But you have no means of
actually tracking that number.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.060
There's no obligation
for the women to tell you

25:12.100 --> 25:14.460
the resultslt of the purchased
sperm once it leaves the depot.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.960
We have binding contracts
with our donors.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.260
But if you talked to adopted children,

25:19.300 --> 25:21.610
they will tell you there is a need.

25:22.100 --> 25:25.260
Even the—the ones raised
by loving adoptive families,

25:25.300 --> 25:27.800
there is a fundamental,

25:27.800 --> 25:29.900
perhaps even primal need,

25:29.900 --> 25:33.200
to know who and where they came from.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.500
And these contracts say,

25:35.500 --> 25:38.900
“no, sorry, sperm donors'
privacy counts more.”

25:38.900 --> 25:40.100
That's wrong.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.460
Parents have always treated
children like chattel,

25:42.500 --> 25:44.160
like acquisitions, but this…

25:44.200 --> 25:45.900
The UK passed a law

25:45.900 --> 25:48.660
ending the practice of
donating sperm anonymously.

25:48.700 --> 25:50.960
Fertility clinics started to dry up.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.560
Some have no sperm at all.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.382
Desperate parents lose out.

25:55.100 --> 25:56.300
All right.

25:56.300 --> 25:58.214
I think I know the arguments.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.900
Yes, son?

26:02.400 --> 26:04.200
I just want to say, judge,

26:04.200 --> 26:06.400
nobody ever consulted me.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.660
Now if I want to know
where I came from,

26:07.700 --> 26:09.400
who my birth father is,

26:09.400 --> 26:11.060
does cancer run in the family,

26:11.100 --> 26:13.960
are there any other diseases
I might be more likely to get,

26:14.000 --> 26:16.060
do I have any brothers or sisters,

26:16.100 --> 26:19.400
is there anybody else out there
who looks like me—

26:19.800 --> 26:22.000
I don't get to know any of that…

26:22.000 --> 26:26.158
because before I was born,
some people entered into a contract.

26:43.400 --> 26:44.600
I'm sorry.

26:45.100 --> 26:48.860
Go tell someone who's interested.
I'm working on my summation.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.700
–Alan, I—
–Get out.

26:50.700 --> 26:52.548
You don't do something like…

26:53.600 --> 26:55.400
Sorry isn't good enough.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.400
Alan…

27:05.700 --> 27:07.000
I'm slipping.

27:09.600 --> 27:12.200
What would ever…

27:13.100 --> 27:14.800
possess me to—

27:14.800 --> 27:16.360
I mean, I do crazy things,

27:16.400 --> 27:19.900
but I-I always know what I'm doing.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.300
My judgment on this was…

27:28.600 --> 27:30.200
I know I'm slipping.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.800
I'm so, so sorry.

27:34.800 --> 27:39.300
For me to have done this to
the person I love most is…

27:41.300 --> 27:43.100
What's happening to me?

27:43.800 --> 27:45.460
Nothing's happening to you.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.100
Yes, it is.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.400
I'm not sure.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.710
Maybe I shouldn't practice anymore.

27:51.300 --> 27:52.900
Look, don't overreact.

27:52.900 --> 27:55.700
I told the clerk of a sitting judge

27:55.700 --> 27:57.900
we had a bet on the case.

28:01.900 --> 28:05.400
If I'm going down, I—I'm not
taking you down with me.

28:05.900 --> 28:07.200
It's time I quit.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.160
If you quit work, Denny,

28:09.200 --> 28:12.360
your brain will shrivel up
to the size of a small raisin,

28:12.400 --> 28:14.300
and you surely will die.

28:20.400 --> 28:24.000
Have you been feeling
other symptoms lately?

28:25.100 --> 28:27.400
Sometimes I feel a little foggy

28:27.400 --> 28:30.800
and I don't seem to always get things.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.700
–For example?
–Obama.

28:32.700 --> 28:33.360
Another example.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.800
The Patriots losing to the Giants.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.400
You're covering.

28:43.800 --> 28:44.960
The idea of not having you—

28:45.000 --> 28:47.300
You will never not have me.

28:49.700 --> 28:51.200
You said we were done.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.500
I was angry, Denny.

28:53.500 --> 28:55.200
I'll get by it.

28:56.100 --> 29:01.400
Our friendship will survive
an act of poor judgment.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.900
–Really?
–Really.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.160
If you want to call off the bet—

29:17.200 --> 29:18.860
I have no interest in doing that.

29:18.900 --> 29:20.000
I plan on winng.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.100
–Double it?
–Done.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.100
Don't tell.

29:27.100 --> 29:27.900
I won't.

29:28.900 --> 29:30.100
Thank you, Alan.

29:31.100 --> 29:34.400
You forgive, I forget—
We make a good team.

29:34.400 --> 29:37.900
Yes. We're a very good team.

29:54.800 --> 29:55.600
All right.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.800
Look, when I grew up,

29:58.800 --> 30:02.360
it was relatively rare to meet
a person who was adopted.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.900
Today adoption is commonplace,

30:04.900 --> 30:07.500
as are multicultural families.

30:07.500 --> 30:12.000
Genealogy is almost considered irrelevant.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.160
But it is relevant.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.860
People do want to know
their genetic history,

30:15.900 --> 30:17.660
whether it is for medical reasons

30:17.700 --> 30:21.100
or just, well, to feel complete

30:21.100 --> 30:23.900
as one adopted friend recently told me.

30:23.900 --> 30:26.000
I agree with Mr Espenson.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.960
We cannot allow a contract
to usurp the autonomy of the child.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.260
The current laws are
anything but current,

30:32.300 --> 30:34.346
and they need to be reexamined.

30:34.700 --> 30:38.200
In the meantime,
I am not ordering the defendant

30:38.200 --> 30:41.960
to tell the plaintiff
the identity of his biological father.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.400
But I am ordering you to tell him

30:44.400 --> 30:46.700
if he and his girlfriend

30:46.700 --> 30:49.000
come from the same sperm donor.

30:50.100 --> 30:53.500
You have my ruling.
We are adjourned.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.620
So what happens now?

30:57.400 --> 30:59.660
Well, we at least find out
if you two are related.

30:59.700 --> 31:01.284
How long will that take?

31:01.600 --> 31:03.580
I would think we'd know today.

31:03.700 --> 31:07.400
Good work, Jerry.
I'm very impressed.

31:17.300 --> 31:21.360
It isn't just the undue economic burden
on the government, your honor,

31:21.400 --> 31:23.760
though that alone would be crippling.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.660
But the subject the military
hospitals to discovery?

31:26.700 --> 31:29.260
That could result in
the free trade of military secrets.

31:29.300 --> 31:32.400
It could compromise military discipline.

31:33.500 --> 31:34.860
Representative Duncan Hunter—

31:34.900 --> 31:37.160
a member of the house
armed services committee

31:37.200 --> 31:40.600
and a former fighter pilot—
consider what he said:

31:40.600 --> 31:43.560
“the Feres doctrine represents
a reasonable approach

31:43.600 --> 31:47.500
”to ensuring that litigation
does not interfere

31:47.500 --> 31:51.500
with the objectives and readiness
of our nation's military.”

31:51.500 --> 31:52.560
You know, and think of it?

31:52.600 --> 31:55.160
Do we really want our
military personnel bogged down

31:55.200 --> 31:59.800
in depositions and motions
while we're trying to fight a war?

31:59.800 --> 32:03.300
And finally, your honor…
consider this:

32:03.300 --> 32:07.200
military hospitals tend
to deal with high volume,

32:07.200 --> 32:10.700
and as Mr Shore noted,
many catastrophic wounds.

32:10.700 --> 32:13.060
We want these kids getting treatment.

32:13.100 --> 32:15.000
The last thing we need

32:15.000 --> 32:18.460
is for doctors to be balking
out of fear of getting sued.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.800
If you take away this immunity,

32:20.800 --> 32:23.400
the reality is,
you'll lose doctors,

32:23.400 --> 32:25.760
and our kids won't get
the medical treatment

32:25.800 --> 32:28.000
they've earned and deserve.

32:28.600 --> 32:29.660
Lawyers love to sue.

32:29.700 --> 32:31.860
It's what we do.
It's how we heat our pools.

32:31.900 --> 32:33.600
But sometimes…

32:34.400 --> 32:36.900
we have to put our country first.

32:36.900 --> 32:38.022
And failing that,

32:38.900 --> 32:41.210
how about you put our troops first?

32:48.900 --> 32:49.700
Ah.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.360
It's surprising to have to explain

32:52.400 --> 32:54.960
the rudiments of our legal system
to opposing counsel,

32:55.000 --> 32:56.800
but I am not suing anyone.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.760
My client is suing
because his brother, a soldier,

32:59.800 --> 33:02.500
was killed by a military hospital.

33:02.500 --> 33:04.860
By the way, there are
no pools being heated here.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.060
I don't have one,
and as for my client,

33:07.100 --> 33:09.760
he should be so lucky to have
a house, let alone a pool.

33:09.800 --> 33:12.460
Although I'm sure he'd
prefer to have his brother.

33:12.500 --> 33:15.760
Private Richard Canfield was in
the Fort Wayne military hospital

33:15.800 --> 33:19.260
getting basic follow-up treatment
for wounds sustained in Iraq,

33:19.300 --> 33:21.360
wounds he was healing from nicely.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.260
He began to have trouble breathing due to

33:23.300 --> 33:25.860
an adverse reaction to medicine
he was mistakenly given.

33:25.900 --> 33:28.960
The doctor then inserted
a breathing tube incorrectly

33:29.000 --> 33:31.060
and proceeded to pump air
into his stomach.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.760
By the time they figured out
their mistake 15 minutes later,

33:33.800 --> 33:36.060
private Canfield
had severe brain damage.

33:36.100 --> 33:37.900
Three days later, he died.

33:37.900 --> 33:39.360
None of this is in dispute.

33:39.400 --> 33:43.700
Had this same malpractice
happened to me or you,

33:43.700 --> 33:46.460
our estates would receive
million-dollar settlements.

33:46.500 --> 33:50.100
But because private Canfield
was a GI, not a nickel.

33:50.100 --> 33:52.700
Apparently, we can all live with that.

33:52.700 --> 33:58.400
This Feres doctrine is as unfair
as it is patently ludicrous.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.560
There is no danger of
revealing military secrets.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.960
Discovery would only go
to medical records.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.800
And frankly, I am mystified

34:05.800 --> 34:09.060
as to how this could possibly
affect military discipline.

34:09.100 --> 34:11.560
Would the troops
suddenly stop saluting

34:11.600 --> 34:14.699
or begin marching in crooked lines?

34:14.699 --> 34:17.460
And as for the supposed burden
on the government,

34:17.500 --> 34:18.960
you've gotta be kidding me.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.199
What about private Canfield's
horrific ordeal?

34:22.199 --> 34:24.060
Not to mention the obvious fact

34:24.100 --> 34:26.760
that while our government
will undoubtedly survive,

34:26.800 --> 34:29.100
private Canfield did not.

34:32.600 --> 34:33.960
I would say to you, your honor,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.178
these are our kids who are dying.

34:36.900 --> 34:40.199
But it's not really our kids, is it?

34:40.199 --> 34:41.699
Not for the most part.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.159
It's the poor people's kids.

34:44.199 --> 34:47.260
And the dirty little secret,
some might say windfall,

34:47.300 --> 34:49.960
of our record poverty
and disparity of wealth

34:50.000 --> 34:52.760
is that we've got plenty of poor people
with kids to fight our wars.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.460
I'm sorry, but I'm offended by that.

34:54.500 --> 34:55.360
Are you, really?

34:55.400 --> 34:57.160
How about a republican
presidential candidate

34:57.200 --> 34:59.660
who opposes educational benefits
for GIs

34:59.700 --> 35:01.960
so as not to encourage troops
to leave the military?

35:02.000 --> 35:04.260
Keep their options limited.
Does that offend you?

35:04.300 --> 35:06.860
How about all the war
profiteering by the rich?

35:06.900 --> 35:07.660
How about the fact

35:07.700 --> 35:11.660
that while an army sergeant gets
an annual salary of $70,000,

35:11.700 --> 35:14.760
private security guards hired
by Blackwater and Dyncorp

35:14.800 --> 35:16.360
get $400,000 to $500,000,

35:16.400 --> 35:17.260
does that offend you?

35:17.300 --> 35:21.060
All kinds of wonderful,
lucrative deals can happen in war,

35:21.100 --> 35:23.460
but for the GIs,
we've got the Feres doctrine,

35:23.500 --> 35:26.660
which means when a GI
is killed by hospital negligence

35:26.700 --> 35:29.660
or even deliberately
by a doctor, not a nickel.

35:29.700 --> 35:33.100
How can this not shock
our national conscience?

35:33.100 --> 35:35.060
The media gives it little if any shrift.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.760
Mr Mathis clearly doesn't care.

35:36.800 --> 35:39.836
And me? Hell, I even
placed a bet on the case.

35:44.800 --> 35:48.800
How can it be
that we don't… much care?

35:51.300 --> 35:54.336
Maybe because it's not
our kids who are dying.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.718
It's the poor people's.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.578
Yes. Yes, that's fine. I'll wait.

36:17.900 --> 36:18.900
I'm on hold.

36:20.700 --> 36:21.860
They have the answer?

36:21.900 --> 36:23.000
It seems so.

36:25.900 --> 36:27.352
It's going to be fine.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.700
I read a study.

36:29.700 --> 36:33.060
People are attracted to
other people who look like them.

36:33.100 --> 36:36.060
It's not unusual for us
to resemble each other.

36:36.100 --> 36:37.900
Yes. Thank you.

36:40.900 --> 36:41.800
Well?

36:50.800 --> 36:53.300
You have the same sperm donor.

37:00.700 --> 37:01.900
I'm sorry.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.300
This isn't fair.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.400
I'm so sorry.

37:34.900 --> 37:36.000
All rise.

37:38.800 --> 37:39.800
Be seated.

37:47.900 --> 37:50.160
I'm allowing the plaintiff's case to stand.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.960
Your honor, the precedent
set by the Feres doctrine—

37:53.000 --> 37:56.760
The Feres doctrine is no longer
applicable in today's world.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.660
Well, in that case,
the remedy is the legislature.

37:58.700 --> 38:00.300
I disagree, counselor.

38:00.300 --> 38:03.200
This doctrine unfairly victimizes the poor.

38:03.200 --> 38:07.800
There are far more rich people
registered to vote than poor people.

38:07.800 --> 38:11.460
This will never get fixed by
an electable legislature, never.

38:11.500 --> 38:14.160
–Your honor—
–I'm allowing the case to stand.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.200
We are adjourned.

38:18.600 --> 38:19.500
Well…

38:20.300 --> 38:21.160
What does this mean?

38:21.200 --> 38:22.960
It means for now, you still get to sue.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.310
Hopefully we can settle it quickly.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.300
Thank you.

38:26.300 --> 38:28.260
I'll schedule a meeting
with opposing counsel,

38:28.300 --> 38:29.460
and we'll see where it goes.

38:29.500 --> 38:30.900
I'll let you know.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.900
Shirley, I apologize again
for any embarrassment that—

38:43.600 --> 38:44.700
Okay.

38:52.900 --> 38:54.300
She'll forgive us.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.660
It sounds like
she's already halfway there.

38:57.700 --> 38:59.800
What makes you say that?

38:59.800 --> 39:03.260
Well, Shirley has no trouble
expressing her displeasure.

39:03.300 --> 39:07.100
But when she says nothing
or walks away in silence,

39:07.100 --> 39:08.800
it's like she's saying,

39:08.800 --> 39:12.600
“I'm still angry,
but I'll forgive you.”

39:17.000 --> 39:18.400
Will you…

39:18.400 --> 39:19.900
really forgive me?

39:20.900 --> 39:22.500
I did already.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.200
I can't believe

39:30.200 --> 39:32.900
I actually said that to the clerk.

39:32.900 --> 39:34.400
Promise me something—

39:34.400 --> 39:37.172
When I do something crazy,
you'll tell me.

39:38.500 --> 39:41.200
Okay, let's start
with doubling the bet.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.200
Oh, right. Yeah.

39:48.200 --> 39:51.260
At least tell me it's going
to a good cause, like a hooker.

39:51.300 --> 39:53.060
It's going to the troops. Remember?

39:53.100 --> 39:56.000
Oh, right, yes. I feel better now.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.100
You okay, Denny?

40:04.300 --> 40:05.400
Oh, yeah.

40:08.700 --> 40:10.284
You really yelled at me.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.300
I just lost my temper.

40:13.700 --> 40:15.000
I'm over it.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.314
You know what's long overdue?

40:20.900 --> 40:22.700
You and me on a road trip.

40:22.700 --> 40:24.400
A road trip.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.300
Maybe we should go to Rome,

40:26.300 --> 40:28.560
or the balcony on
the other side of the building.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.700
Yeah, I've got it.
A dude ranch.

40:31.700 --> 40:33.200
A dude ranch?

40:33.200 --> 40:38.200
It's horses and—and sheep
and fresh air and…

40:38.500 --> 40:39.600
Sheep.

40:40.800 --> 40:43.800
Let's go west,
to the wild west.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.800
I don't really like horses.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.700
How can you not like horses?

40:47.700 --> 40:48.800
Dude ranch?

40:48.800 --> 40:49.460
You just leave it to me.

40:49.500 --> 40:50.960
I'll make all the arrangements.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.900
We'll have campfires
and marshmallows and tents…

40:54.900 --> 40:55.900
and… sheep.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.000
Me and you and…

40:58.900 --> 41:01.012
Fresh air would do us both good.

41:01.500 --> 41:02.900
That is what we need.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.000
Thank you…

41:14.200 --> 41:15.900
For being…

41:18.100 --> 41:19.000
Thank you.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.642
I don't think
you're slipping, Denny.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.200
I really don't.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.600
Okay.

41:33.800 --> 41:40.300
