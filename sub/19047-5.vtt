00:02.168 --> 00:05.337
[ Man ]
Okay, so just to clarify
for the parole board once again,

00:05.339 --> 00:07.272
<i>you are claiming</i>
<i>that your father threatened...</i>

00:07.274 --> 00:12.478
to, quote,
"Eat the living shit
out of you."

00:13.613 --> 00:16.782
[ Microphone Squeals ]
Uh,
that is correct.

00:16.784 --> 00:19.251
<i>And, Mr. Kelly, in your</i>
<i>sworn statement to police,</i>

00:19.253 --> 00:24.056
you've claimed that
the prisoner told you
that if you didn't, and I quote,

00:24.058 --> 00:27.126
"Jam a bunch of stuff
into your butt,

00:27.128 --> 00:31.797
he was going
to rape you so hard
the room would stink."

00:33.199 --> 00:36.468
And he was going
to, quote,

00:36.470 --> 00:41.440
"Eat your butt
and his son's butt
in the stink...

00:41.442 --> 00:45.344
"until his stomach
was full of...

00:45.346 --> 00:47.579
your butts."

00:47.581 --> 00:48.647
Is this correct?

00:48.649 --> 00:51.450
[ Microphone Squeals ]
That is also correct.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

00:51.452 --> 00:55.387
<i>Warden, they're lying.</i>
<i>I do not wanna hurt them.</i>

00:55.389 --> 00:59.825
In fact, I wanna get
as far away from those two...

00:59.827 --> 01:01.160
as I possibly can.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.462
[ Together ] Objection!
That's an objection,
Your Honor! He's lying.

01:03.464 --> 01:07.599
Hey! hey, hey, hey, hey!
Move to strike!
Move to strike that!

01:07.601 --> 01:09.535
<i>Quiet! Sit down!</i>
<i>Sit down!</i>

01:09.537 --> 01:11.703
Sit down.
Get your hands
off the microphone!

01:11.705 --> 01:14.239
Well--
Just leave it
in the middle of the two of you.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.240
Leave it alone!
He said in the middle.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.577
Take your hands off the mike!
Leave it alone.
That's not the middle.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.312
Leave it there.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.680
<i>[ Clears Throat ]</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

01:21.682 --> 01:27.619
A few weeks ago,
they came to apologize
for getting me arrested.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.588
I did not accept
their apology.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.823
That never happened!
He threatened--

01:30.825 --> 01:32.858
Shut up!
Charlie, shut up!
Quiet! Quiet!

01:32.860 --> 01:34.827
<i>Quiet at the hearing!</i>

01:34.829 --> 01:36.228
[ Clicks ]
[ Mac ]
Oh, yeah, Dad?

01:36.230 --> 01:41.333
Not gonna accept our apology?
Okay, fine. Plan "B," bitch.
We're gonna bury you.

01:41.335 --> 01:44.369
[ Charlie ] Yeah, Mr. Mac.
I'm gonna tell those
parole board dickheads...

01:44.371 --> 01:47.506
<i>that you said you were</i>
<i>gonna rape my butt</i>
<i>until the room stinks.</i>

01:47.508 --> 01:51.610
<i>And then you're</i>
<i>gonna eat my butt until</i>
<i>your stomach's full of butt,</i>

01:51.612 --> 01:54.313
<i>full of my butt</i>
<i>and full of Mac's butt.</i>

01:54.315 --> 01:56.348
[ Mac ] You're not gonna
say it exactly like that--

01:56.350 --> 01:57.749
[ Charlie ]
I'm gonna say
something like that.

01:57.751 --> 02:01.153
All the butt business
is really gonna sell it.
[ Clicks ]

02:38.324 --> 02:40.526
<i>Charlie, I'm telling you</i>
<i>running away is not the answer.</i>

02:40.528 --> 02:43.562
We're gonna need
supplies on the road.
So just calm down.

02:43.564 --> 02:44.963
Help me throw some stuff
into the stick and bindle.

02:44.965 --> 02:47.566
Dude, no matter where we go,
my dad will find us.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.334
And while I admit
it would be awesome...

02:49.336 --> 02:51.770
to be hoboes drifting from town
to town solving mysteries,

02:51.772 --> 02:53.438
I think we need
to find a real solution.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.275
Oh, my God!
How do hoboes fit all
their stuff into a bandana?

02:56.277 --> 03:00.312
It doesn't make sense, man!
We're gonna need like a towel
or a tablecloth or something!

03:00.314 --> 03:02.948
It's not gonna look cool!
We're gonna look like assholes
running around.

03:02.950 --> 03:06.585
Wait a second, dude.
That's it. I got it.
Forget the bindle.

03:06.587 --> 03:09.354
The only way that my dad
is not going to kill us...

03:09.356 --> 03:10.822
is if he thinks
we're already dead.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.358
Great. I was hoping
you'd say that.
Let's kill ourselves.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.860
No. You didn't let me finish.
It's no problem, dude.

03:14.862 --> 03:18.864
I'm totally on board, okay?
I'm gonna grab a knife,
jab it into your neck,

03:18.866 --> 03:21.300
yank it out,
then your blood's
gonna start going everywhere.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.401
Listen--
You'll die
in five or 10 minutes.

03:22.403 --> 03:25.737
And then depending on how
horrific that looks, I'll
probably do it myself too.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.839
Listen.
I was gonna say
we fake our own death.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.475
Yeah? Uh-huh?
He thinks we're dead
and leaves us alone.

03:30.477 --> 03:33.312
Yeah. Either way works.
Let's just pick one
before he gets here!

03:33.314 --> 03:36.748
Let's pick the second one
where we don't actually die.
We'll pick the second one.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.551
Calm down!
We'll pick the second one.
Now, let's think.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.687
We gotta do it in some way
that's convincing.
Right.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.323
If we were
gonna kill ourselves,
it'd be awesome, right?

03:44.325 --> 03:47.960
Yeah. Yeah.
If we were gonna kill ourselves,
it would be with class, right?

03:47.962 --> 03:49.861
Because--
Of course it
would be with class.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.630
What do you think,
I'm not gonna
die with class?

03:51.632 --> 03:54.600
Maybe some type of explosion?
Of course an explosion!
I'm not gonna explode?

03:54.602 --> 03:57.869
Okay, great.
Charlie, it would be some kind
of blaze-of-glory thing.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.439
Of course it's gonna
be a blaze of glory.
Because we--

04:00.441 --> 04:02.841
I'm going down
right now, bro.
Hold on a second.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.544
What's up?
Okay, all right. So--

04:05.546 --> 04:07.346
Did I miss something?
You're not getting this.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.014
I'll walk you through
the steps as we go.

04:09.016 --> 04:12.017
First step, do not douse
yourself with lighter fluid.

04:14.287 --> 04:16.722
<i>[ Dee ]</i>
<i>Whoa. What is that?</i>
<i>[ Frank ] I don't know.</i>

04:16.724 --> 04:18.690
You think it's
for watching somebody poop?

04:18.692 --> 04:21.460
You think there's
some perv coming in here
to watch me make?

04:21.462 --> 04:23.362
What are you doing in here?
I got to go to the bathroom.

04:23.364 --> 04:27.366
There's a hole in the wall.
We're just trying
to figure out what it is.

04:27.368 --> 04:30.802
Well, well, well, Deandra.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.605
Would you look at that.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.873
[ Chuckles ]
Frank, Dee,

04:34.875 --> 04:39.711
what you two have
discovered today is what is
most commonly referred to...

04:39.713 --> 04:41.747
as a glory hole.

04:41.749 --> 04:42.648
A glory hole?

04:42.650 --> 04:47.419
A secret portal created
as a passageway for one
to safely insert one's penis.

04:47.421 --> 04:50.022
I'm sorry. A hole
to stick your dick in?
Yes, Dee.

04:50.024 --> 04:52.057
The partition acts
as a physical barrier,

04:52.059 --> 04:55.894
thus ensuring anonymity
throughout the spontaneous
act of copulation...

04:55.896 --> 04:59.798
or fellatio or,
at the very least,
a hand job.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.368
What? Why?
Why would you wanna have sex
with someone you can't see?

05:03.370 --> 05:06.071
Well, Dee, I think
the real question is,

05:06.073 --> 05:08.840
why wouldn't
you wanna have sex
with someone you can't see?

05:08.842 --> 05:12.144
It's very European.
You see, Europe leads the way
in sexual exploration.

05:12.146 --> 05:16.114
And, quite frankly,
I think it's time
we caught up.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.749
<i>This... sounds hot.</i>

05:17.751 --> 05:20.852
- I'm gonna go get
some duct tape.
- Whoa! Hold on a second, Frank.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.788
<i>Before you go sticking</i>
<i>anything through that hole,</i>

05:22.790 --> 05:25.724
you might wanna consider
that on the other side
of this wall,

05:25.726 --> 05:28.427
more often than not,
there's a dude.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.696
But you can't see
through the wall.

05:30.698 --> 05:31.997
So how do you know
it's not a girl?

05:31.999 --> 05:36.668
I mean, I can just
picture a girl, and then...
it's good. [ Chuckles ]

05:36.670 --> 05:39.571
Right. Well,
some might find
that method effective,

05:39.573 --> 05:42.541
but it's a dangerous game
you're playing, Frank.

05:42.543 --> 05:46.144
Supposing the other guy
is picturing a girl also?

05:46.146 --> 05:49.481
How is he gonna do that
with a dick in his mouth?

05:49.483 --> 05:52.951
I don't know.
That's his problem.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.886
We're filling it in.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.121
Okay, buddy,
you ready?

05:56.123 --> 05:58.957
[ Muffled ] Are you sure
we have to do this?
Yes, we have to do this.

05:58.959 --> 06:02.594
If the cops are gonna
identify the bodies, we need
to leave dental records behind.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.830
So we leave a couple of teeth.
Bing-bang-boom!

06:04.832 --> 06:06.598
I know. I feel like
it's gonna hurt.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.035
Yeah, it's gonna hurt
like a bitch. Okay, ready?
Uh-huh.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.703
One, two-- Wait.
Uh-oh.

06:11.705 --> 06:15.440
That just kind
of came out on its own.
Yeah, that slipped right out.

06:15.442 --> 06:17.476
I barely pulled that.
Whoa.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.478
[ Gasps ]
What?

06:19.480 --> 06:20.312
Damn, dude.
That's another.

06:20.314 --> 06:23.148
You should really
brush your teeth more
because that is not normal.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.684
[ Yelps ]
Oh! Charlie, stop pulling
your teeth out like that.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.719
They're just
coming right out.
You're freaking me out.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.055

slip right out.

<i>We got a dick hole in the bar.</i>
<i>Come fill it in.</i>

06:36.897 --> 06:41.133
[ Sighs ] I got
to go fill her dick hole.
No, no. We don't have time.

06:41.135 --> 06:44.536
Okay. Audible.
Grab the camera.
Is Dee's car outside?

06:44.538 --> 06:45.837
Uh-- Yes.
Okay, great.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.073
We'll steal it.

Now you got to stop.
You really got to stop.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.945

The videotape is done.
My teeth are scattered
throughout the car.

07:27.681 --> 07:31.082
And the will is in place.
Okay. Great.
Toss it out the window.

07:31.084 --> 07:34.019
They'll think we did it
at the last minute.
Okay. Got it.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.220
Yeah.
What's next?

07:35.222 --> 07:39.224
I'm gonna gun this car
as fast as it goes
directly into that wall.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.592
Mm-hmm.
Judging by the distance,

07:40.594 --> 07:43.895
I can get her up to about
60, 70 miles an hour.
Oh, definitely. Definitely.

07:43.897 --> 07:47.599
At the last possible second--
I'm thinking maybe
three feet from the wall--

07:47.601 --> 07:51.670
we jump out to safety,
the car explodes
in a hot ball of fury,

07:51.672 --> 07:55.640
and we're dead
to the world.
Okeydokey. Good luck with that.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.709
Wait.
Where you going, dude?

07:57.711 --> 07:59.578
Well, I'm gonna--
I'm gonna watch you do it.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.080
No. We need
to do it together.
I'm not really doing anything.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.182
Yes, you are, Charlie.
You're here
for moral support.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.151
But if no one's actually
seeing us jump out of the car--

08:06.153 --> 08:08.587
We're gonna
kill ourselves together.
I wouldn't want you--

08:08.589 --> 08:10.589
Get out. Get out. Get out.
I'll do it myself.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.991
The whole thing's
gonna be better
without me anyway, Mac.

be great without me.

to burn the car.

some gasoline.

Whoo!

Pawn shop, dude?
We're not gonna find something
to burn the car at a pawn shop.

You can find amazing
things in pawn shops.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.070

What about
a gas station, dude?

08:59.072 --> 09:00.872
You can buy some gasoline
to burn the car.

But we've been
talking about this
the whole walk over.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.809
