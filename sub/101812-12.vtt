00:23.110 --> 00:25.199
...were you really gonna
ask me to marry you?

00:26.852 --> 00:28.767
Yes.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.639
I made the ring myself.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.902
For you.

00:32.945 --> 00:34.469
I brought it to
Mexico City so that

00:34.512 --> 00:35.818
we could find a private
place somewhere

00:35.861 --> 00:38.255
on a beach or a
bridge or a cliff.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.430
Then I ended up
having to use it

00:39.474 --> 00:41.215

a glass window

00:41.258 --> 00:42.694

by falling chunks of skyscraper.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.696

it's not the story

00:44.740 --> 00:46.829

kids, but at the same time...Kids?

from barely dating to engaged

and the British prime minster's

02:27.234 --> 02:28.974
"RaOliver's Rockin' Wedding."

02:29.018 --> 02:30.976
Ever since Oliver proposed

02:31.020 --> 02:32.978
on the Tower Bridge,
these two have become

02:33.022 --> 02:35.067

02:36.547 --> 02:38.593

in the form of threats.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.204
What kind of threats?

02:41.248 --> 02:42.640
Bomb, hostage,

02:42.684 --> 02:43.772
death threats.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.382
But our good friends at Interpol

02:45.426 --> 02:48.516

threats could be credible.

02:48.559 --> 02:50.605
As a result, there should be
heightened security

02:50.648 --> 02:52.781
at the wedding, but
the king of Bikaner is insisting

02:52.824 --> 02:55.610
that only his royal guard
be entrusted with the task.

02:55.653 --> 02:58.134
MacGYVER: I don't understand.
It only makes sense

02:58.178 --> 03:00.702
to bring in additional security.
Am I wrong?

03:00.745 --> 03:02.182
His pride won't allow it.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.227
Especially since
the moment Rani says "I do,"

03:04.271 --> 03:06.490
she becomes queen of Bikaner.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.492
King Sunil doesn't want
to appear weak--

03:08.536 --> 03:10.712
as if he can't protect
his own daughter.

03:10.755 --> 03:12.801
Not only will Rani be given
the keys to the kingdom,

03:12.844 --> 03:14.977
but she will also take
over the family's

03:15.020 --> 03:16.892
rather lucrative
mineral business.

03:16.935 --> 03:20.678
And contrary to her father's
isolationist policies,

03:20.722 --> 03:23.681
Rani's gone on record
as saying that

03:23.725 --> 03:26.989
she will open Bikaner's zinc
supplies to the global market,

03:27.032 --> 03:29.948

trade mecca.

03:35.084 --> 03:37.042
Extremist groups
in Bikaner

03:37.086 --> 03:39.306
oppose opening trade
with the West,

03:39.349 --> 03:41.612
fearing a new form
of neocolonialism.

03:41.656 --> 03:44.615

in Great Britain

03:44.659 --> 03:47.096

Oliver's choice in a bride,

"fit the mold."

09:31.571 --> 09:34.051
Dougal, Dougal, Dougal
the entire weekend, all right?

09:34.095 --> 09:37.272
And what if I don't play
along, Lord MacTavish?

09:37.315 --> 09:39.361
Oh, I do rather like
the sound of that.

09:39.404 --> 09:41.363
Is that why you snuck off?
Left me...
Darling.

09:41.406 --> 09:43.147
Been looking
all over for you.

09:43.191 --> 09:45.628
SOFIA:
I was just, uh, catching
up with an old friend.

09:45.672 --> 09:46.716
Let me introduce you.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.065
This is Rudolf Von Stupensen,

09:48.109 --> 09:49.850
the Vice Count of Austria.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.373
And, Rudy, may I present...

09:51.416 --> 09:54.115
Lord Dougal MacTavish.

09:56.073 --> 09:58.946
[indistinct chatter]

09:58.989 --> 10:00.251
RILEY:
Okay.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.862
Okay, give me just a second.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.472
Getting a live feed now.

10:05.213 --> 10:08.259
A few have stints in prison
for minor crimes.

10:08.303 --> 10:09.652
No red flags.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.088
MacGYVER:
Copy that.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.745
I may need backup
at the courtyard.

10:21.055 --> 10:22.752
[exhales]

10:24.101 --> 10:26.277
Abort.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.410
What does it say
about me if I think

10:28.453 --> 10:29.977
a silver domed plate
has a gun under it,

10:30.020 --> 10:31.282
not delicious rice?

10:31.326 --> 10:33.110
It says that you're good
at your job.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.637
Mm.
Hi.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.421
My fault.
I'm in the way.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.336
It's just so good fresh.
[laughs]

10:41.379 --> 10:43.077
The Pithi ceremony
is amazing,

10:43.120 --> 10:45.079
but if I don't get
something in my stomach

10:45.122 --> 10:47.385
before I get my face rubbed
with turmeric paste

10:47.429 --> 10:49.126
for an hour,
I may faint.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.606
Well, it's your wedding.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.781
I'm sure you could
push it back an hour.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.740
[laughs]
I have no say in the matter.

10:53.783 --> 10:56.481
Just like I had little say
in the guest list, so...

10:58.266 --> 11:02.357
Are you here to get on my dad's
or Oliver's dad's good side?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.359
Well, getting on your good side
wouldn't be such a bad idea.

11:04.402 --> 11:05.839
I'm Rani.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.275
Tien Ly.
Ah,

11:07.318 --> 11:08.624
the hotel empire.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.234
Can I offer you
and Oliver a stay

11:10.278 --> 11:12.367
at any of our royalty
suites for your honeymoon?

11:12.410 --> 11:14.412
Security's already
planned it for us.

11:14.456 --> 11:17.546
Hey, Ran, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

11:17.589 --> 11:19.069
I can't make the Pithi.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.898
Doing a helicopter tour.
Have fun.

11:21.942 --> 11:24.248
No worries, Elise. Have fun.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.775
[whispers]:
My fiancé's ex-girlfriend.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.473
I've got to go.
Wedding machine never stops.

11:31.516 --> 11:32.866
But it was really nice
to meet you.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.302
You, too.Bye.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.784
Established contact
with the princess.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.133
Super nice, by the way.

11:41.135 --> 11:43.354
[Scottish accent]:
Do you mind if I just
borrow the lassie there

11:43.398 --> 11:45.356
for a wee minute there?

11:45.400 --> 11:46.575
I'll catch up.

11:49.404 --> 11:50.840
[regular accent]:
So, did you tell him about us?

11:50.884 --> 11:52.624
There's no "us."

11:52.668 --> 11:54.365
Well, I think April of last
year would beg to differ.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.367
It was a special circumstance.

11:56.411 --> 11:58.195
People did a lot
of strange things in quarantine.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.501
Strange, was it?

12:01.764 --> 12:03.070
Is that why you left

12:03.113 --> 12:07.204
without so much
as a "Fare thee well," hmm?

12:07.248 --> 12:09.380
BOZER:
Desi, Taylor,
get to the loading dock.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.121
Someone's trying
to kidnap the princess.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.557
[whimpers]

12:12.601 --> 12:13.776
[shouting in Hindi]

12:16.561 --> 12:18.563
[Rani screams]

12:18.607 --> 12:20.522
[gunfire continues]

12:25.179 --> 12:26.223
[shouting in Hindi]

12:32.055 --> 12:33.622
[screams]

12:34.841 --> 12:35.798
[engine revving]

12:46.461 --> 12:48.115
MacGYVER:
It's one of the flower vendors.

12:48.158 --> 12:50.117
Hands up.[gun clicks]

12:50.160 --> 12:51.205
You're under arrest for
the attempted kidnapping

12:51.248 --> 12:52.772
of Princess Rani.

13:04.087 --> 13:05.654
NITESH:
As head of the royal guard,

13:05.697 --> 13:07.351
the Bikaner government agrees
that your punishment

13:07.395 --> 13:08.918
lies in my hands.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.615
Call Wilt Bozer
at the Phoenix Foundation.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.356
We had nothing to do with Rani's
attempted kidnapping.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.836
The optics say otherwise.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.185
DESI:
You would be conducting
a very public

13:15.229 --> 13:16.839
princess hunt right
now without us.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.406
How about a thank-you?

13:18.449 --> 13:20.887
RANI:
Nitesh, let them go.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.192
They saved me.NITESH:
All due respect,

13:22.236 --> 13:23.454
they're trespassing imposters.

13:23.498 --> 13:24.847
You are mistaken.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.240
This is Tien Ly.

13:27.328 --> 13:29.852
Actually, my name
is Desi Nguyen.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.246
This is Russ Taylor
and Angus MacGyver.

13:32.289 --> 13:33.638
We're here as extra security.TAYLOR:
As a favor

13:33.682 --> 13:36.685
to our friends at
MI6 and Interpol.

13:36.728 --> 13:39.166
In case anything
like this happened.

13:39.209 --> 13:41.908
I'm sorry I lied to you,
but we were undercover.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.519
Lucky me, I guess.

13:44.562 --> 13:47.435
Nitesh, uncuff them now.

13:49.698 --> 13:50.699
SUMITA:
I'm Rani's guardian

13:50.742 --> 13:52.657
and the king's top advisor.

13:52.701 --> 13:55.008
We owe you a debt of gratitude.

13:55.051 --> 13:57.010
Anything you need,
please let us know.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.576
MacGYVER:
Well, we would
like to run

13:58.620 --> 14:00.274
the background checks
on the vendors ourselves,

14:00.317 --> 14:02.493
and we'll need a complete list
to do that.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.713
Absolutely.
Did you hear him?

14:14.897 --> 14:18.335
Your partner told us everything.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.685
[speaking Hindi]

14:20.729 --> 14:22.600
Corroborate the name
and location of your boss,

14:22.644 --> 14:25.168
and you'll see daylight again
before you turn 90.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.257
[speaking Hindi]

14:35.004 --> 14:36.266
Cut the A/C.

14:37.615 --> 14:41.184
We'll be back
in a few very hot hours.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.188
How'd it go?

14:45.232 --> 14:47.321
Oh, he's one of those
"die before they talk" types.

14:47.364 --> 14:49.279
Not a fan. Any progress here?

14:49.323 --> 14:51.978
Mr. Head of the Royal
Guard himself, Nitesh,

14:52.021 --> 14:54.023
is a member of The Blue Arrow,
one the region's

14:54.067 --> 14:55.851
extremist groups hell-bent
on isolationism.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.853
MacGYVER:
Which not only
gives him access

14:57.897 --> 15:00.334
and opportunity as
the head of security,

15:00.377 --> 15:01.901
but now we have motive as well.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.467
Yes, he seemed rather
keen to get rid of us.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.426
We also flagged
one of Oliver's exes

15:05.469 --> 15:08.298
as a suspect,
Elise Deveroux.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.518
She has bad blood with Rani.
I saw it with my own eyes.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.302
Guys, I just found
a wire transfer

15:12.346 --> 15:13.738
sent from the palace grounds

15:13.782 --> 15:15.175
an hour before
the kidnapping attempt,

15:15.218 --> 15:16.828
and you're not gonna guess
who it's from.

15:16.872 --> 15:19.005
Oliver's trust fund.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.355
Two million rupees to a
local real estate company

15:21.398 --> 15:22.965
for 3,000 acres.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.707
BOZER:
Maybe Oliver's not
doing the buying.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.753
His mom Bella has business ties
to overseas big pharma.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.407
MacGYVER:
And the zinc-rich land
could yield a steady profit

15:30.451 --> 15:32.148
in that industry.

15:32.192 --> 15:34.716
So Bella's using her son's
engagement to broker a deal

15:34.759 --> 15:36.674
that otherwise would've
been impossible.Wait. [shushes]

15:36.718 --> 15:39.155
[whispers]:
Guys. Guys.

15:39.199 --> 15:40.940
Someone's listening.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.948
[laughs]
Sofia!

15:48.991 --> 15:51.298
I really want to talk to you,
but, uh, now is not a good time.

15:51.341 --> 15:53.996
Um...Really, Russ, I can see feet

15:54.040 --> 15:55.519
under the drapes.

15:55.563 --> 15:57.913
TAYLOR:
Uh...

15:57.957 --> 16:00.133
Ah. You both must work
for Russel's think tank.

16:00.176 --> 16:03.136
Ooh, this is gonna be good.
Riley, look.

16:03.179 --> 16:05.312
SOFIA:
I'm Sofia.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.836
I'm sure he's told you
all about me.[laughs]

16:07.879 --> 16:10.491
Taylor and his booty call again.

16:10.534 --> 16:11.883
Guess he had
it coming.

16:11.927 --> 16:13.668
DESI:
Clearly you two have

16:13.711 --> 16:15.452
some catching up to do, so...

16:18.064 --> 16:20.022
We will be speaking
to the groom.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.893
See what Oliver knows.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.768
To what do I owe this pleasure?

16:26.811 --> 16:30.337
I wanted to talk to you.
In private.

16:30.380 --> 16:31.512
I really want to know
the real reason

16:31.555 --> 16:33.296
why you left during quarantine.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.341
Don't think I didn't
have a good time.

16:34.384 --> 16:36.212
So, then, why did you leave?

16:36.256 --> 16:37.648
I needed space.

16:37.692 --> 16:39.302
I would've given you
all the time you needed.

16:39.346 --> 16:40.738
You didn't have to ignore me.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.218
And that's why I'm here.

16:42.262 --> 16:46.135
Time and distance
has made me realize

16:46.179 --> 16:48.094
what we had was real.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.230
Yes...

16:56.972 --> 16:59.235
I thought so, too.

16:59.279 --> 17:01.890
Why not pick up
where we left off?

17:01.933 --> 17:05.241
[laughs softly]Let's make up for lost time.

17:15.251 --> 17:17.645
PARKER:
I've got those Petrovic clips
that you requested.

17:17.688 --> 17:19.951
MATTY:
Good, let's start
with Vlado Nanic.

17:25.696 --> 17:28.047
Body turned away at 30 degrees.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.658
Pulled off his feet.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.051
Submissive.

17:33.617 --> 17:34.923
Weak. Loyal.

17:34.966 --> 17:36.751
He'll never flip.

17:36.794 --> 17:39.058
Show me Esma Jelic.

17:40.929 --> 17:44.063
Head bowed slightly.
Shoulders hunched.

17:45.151 --> 17:48.067
She knows the handshake
is coming...

17:48.110 --> 17:51.157
but she's still caught
off guard by it. She fears him.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.159
She'll never tell us
what we need to know.

17:53.202 --> 17:56.075
Show me Adem Divjak.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.036
Eyes locked.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.646
Fully confident.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.694
Self-assured.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.131
Defiant.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.046
And willing to show it
to Petrovic's face.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.657
Which means there's no loyalty,

18:13.701 --> 18:16.138
no trust, and no way
he won't flip on him.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.314
That's our guy.
He'll get us to the broker.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.011
Call the tac team to his house.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.143
On it.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.450
OLIVER:
What is all this?

18:23.493 --> 18:24.494
MacGYVER:
We have some questions about

18:24.538 --> 18:25.843
your financial activities today.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.889
Yeah, your trust fund's
been busy.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.371
How did you find out?

18:31.414 --> 18:33.155
You didn't tell her, did you?

18:33.199 --> 18:34.852
MacGYVER:
Was it you

18:34.896 --> 18:36.158
and your mother?

18:36.202 --> 18:38.073
Pardon?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.293
DESI:
Your mother used the wedding
to finalize a deal for the land,

18:40.336 --> 18:41.990
and then tried to get rid of the
collateral damage, the princess.

18:42.033 --> 18:46.037
This is absurd. Just because
I bought a gift for Rani

18:46.081 --> 18:49.215
doesn't mean my mum hired
those people to kidnap her.

18:50.433 --> 18:51.826
DESI:
The land was a gift?

18:51.869 --> 18:54.176
For her dream elephant
sanctuary, yes.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.569
She told me you people

18:55.612 --> 18:56.744
were supposed to be
good at your jobs.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.098
SUMITA:
Do you think
he's telling the truth?

19:03.142 --> 19:05.753
Of course.I was asking them.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.537
MacGYVER:
Well, this is why

19:07.581 --> 19:09.757
we wanted Rani here-- I mean,
she knows Oliver best.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.890
But do you truly
know his family?

19:12.934 --> 19:15.110
I would strongly suggest

19:15.154 --> 19:17.156
we postpone the wedding
till MacGyver and Desi

19:17.199 --> 19:18.896
look deeper
into Bella Hughes.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.202
Postponing now
would cause a scandal.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.161
I took a vow
on your mother's deathbed

19:22.204 --> 19:24.337
to keep you safe,
and I will honor that vow

19:24.380 --> 19:25.816
as long as I live.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.470
Then I think Desi

19:27.514 --> 19:28.776
should be
my official security

19:28.819 --> 19:30.343
for the weekend.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.693
Yes. It would be my honor.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.043
[knocking on door]

19:35.086 --> 19:37.306
Oh. Mac.

19:37.350 --> 19:38.699
How did you get on with Oliver?

19:38.742 --> 19:41.354
Yeah, he's clear,

Well...

20:06.509 --> 20:08.511
on your mind, Mac?

Look, normally I talk to Bozer
about this kind of stuff,

20:10.296 --> 20:12.559

with the mission

20:12.602 --> 20:14.169

to distract him.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.606

it's business as usual.

20:34.407 --> 20:38.672
So why not just
talk to her about it?

20:38.715 --> 20:40.500
That's the thing, Desi doesn't
want to talk about it.

20:40.543 --> 20:43.024
You know, it's like she-she
drops these little bread crumbs

20:43.067 --> 20:47.071

for the next one.

20:47.115 --> 20:48.899

Point I'm trying to make

20:48.943 --> 20:51.162
is that she should've told me
this, like, a long time ago.

to infiltrate Codex a secret

20:53.730 --> 20:56.777

20:58.605 --> 21:01.303
Look, give Desi all the space
that she needs.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.087
If you keep
pushing,

21:03.131 --> 21:04.959
you could just push her
away for good.

21:14.708 --> 21:17.450
when my mother was alive, we had
peacocks roaming in the garden.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.930
After her death, my father
couldn't bear the sight of them,

21:19.974 --> 21:25.109
so... it's like having
a little piece of her with me.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.198
I'm sure she's watching
over you today,

on the precipice of the rest

21:45.869 --> 21:48.089

only to have it ripped away.

21:48.132 --> 21:50.004
It was pretty tragic.

21:51.222 --> 21:54.225
And, honestly, I thought
I was over it, but...

21:54.269 --> 21:56.619

I know it's the only thing

21:56.663 --> 22:00.014

Oliver's ex

22:16.204 --> 22:17.379
Elise and Oliver's parents
are close.

22:17.423 --> 22:18.380
It was non-negotiable.

standing close enough.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.484

You were that much
of a threat to her?

We found him collapsed

23:01.858 --> 23:03.469
Based on the bruising
around his neck,

23:03.512 --> 23:05.296
my guess is strangulation.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.342
There's no visible sign
of a struggle.

to the room.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.693
Yes, looks like an inside job.

23:10.737 --> 23:12.173
Whoever did this was behind
the kidnapping attempt

their tracks.

23:52.866 --> 23:57.087
Mac, what's that there?

23:58.611 --> 24:00.482
It's henna, meaning

over time.

Then we can cross-reference
the shade with the Instagram

41:21.217 --> 41:23.481
Yes, I know.

41:23.524 --> 41:26.527
I've been researching it
since I was 16 years old.

41:26.571 --> 41:28.529
Looking in all
the wrong places.

41:28.573 --> 41:30.749
That's why Rudolf
is my plus-one.

41:30.792 --> 41:31.924
The Von Stupensens

41:31.967 --> 41:34.883
had ties with the Nazis.

41:36.145 --> 41:37.886
And during World War II,
it was rumored

41:37.930 --> 41:42.195
that the Nazis found
Atahualpa's treasure. Hmm.

41:44.632 --> 41:48.897
So, you're working poor old Rudy
and his family connections

41:48.941 --> 41:50.812
for intel about the treasure,
are you?

41:53.902 --> 41:55.338
Yes.

41:56.339 --> 41:57.950
And once I get
more intel,

41:57.993 --> 42:00.648
I think you and I should go
and find it together.

42:08.003 --> 42:09.744
[vocalizing]

42:09.788 --> 42:11.833
MATTY:
I'm guessing,
because you're dancing,

42:11.877 --> 42:13.313
things went well in Bikaner.

42:15.097 --> 42:16.577
Yes, it did.

42:16.621 --> 42:17.752
In a surprise twist of events,

42:17.796 --> 42:18.797
the killer turned out
to be Sumita,

42:18.840 --> 42:21.234
Rani's trusted advisor.

42:21.277 --> 42:23.845
Well, sometimes the people
closest to us

42:23.889 --> 42:25.455
aren't who they seem to be.

42:27.109 --> 42:28.807
Where's Riley?

42:33.159 --> 42:35.204
♪

42:37.076 --> 42:38.773
Sorry I'm late.

42:45.954 --> 42:48.566
Welcome to the Brink.

42:48.609 --> 42:51.220
I'm Artemis37.

42:51.264 --> 42:53.309
Let's get to work.
