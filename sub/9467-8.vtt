00:11.010 --> 00:14.881
'...a bit. Hello, I'm Jimmy Carr
and welcome to Drunk History,

00:14.881 --> 00:18.385
the show that brings you
genuine stories from history,

00:18.385 --> 00:22.322
as told by blind-drunk comedians.'

00:22.322 --> 00:25.392
'We're making history

00:27.994 --> 00:30.363
"I'm Napoleon, for crying out loud!"

00:30.363 --> 00:32.432
"Never done the flamenco for ME!"

00:32.432 --> 00:34.434
"I am a German."

00:34.434 --> 00:38.171
"Best news I've heard all day."
"Nailed it!"

00:38.171 --> 00:40.173
"Oh, my God!"

00:40.173 --> 00:43.109
(cheers)

00:54.521 --> 00:56.790
'We start tonight with Tom Parry

00:56.790 --> 01:00.960
telling us about the writer
of Sherlock, Arthur Conan Doyle,

01:00.960 --> 01:05.632
in a story we like to call
The Case of the Disappearing...'

01:10.236 --> 01:13.706
'...of the Baskervilles.
It's a classic!'

01:13.706 --> 01:17.544
Here we go, guys.
Here we go, power team.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.712
Yeah! You're on board.

01:19.712 --> 01:22.215
This is the story of how a guy

01:22.215 --> 01:26.786
who wrote the story
of the best detective in the world

01:26.786 --> 01:30.356
became the best detective
in the world.

01:30.356 --> 01:32.759
Ay-ohhhhh!

01:32.759 --> 01:36.362
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

01:36.362 --> 01:40.633
Conan, urgh, as in the barbarian.

01:40.633 --> 01:45.772
Hero. Who wrote, have you heard
of him, Sherlock Holmes?

01:45.772 --> 01:48.475
Er... Yes, we have.

01:48.475 --> 01:52.612
By the way. The guy who gave
Benedict Cumberbatch his career.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.615
Thank you very much, Cumberbatch!

01:55.615 --> 01:57.851
Anyway, picture the scene.

01:57.851 --> 02:02.388
Conan Doyle is strutting
through the morning papers.

02:02.388 --> 02:06.559
"Dinka-dinka-dink-dink,
local council, page three."

02:06.559 --> 02:08.394
And then he hits this case.

02:08.394 --> 02:13.233
"Ooh, hello! Social injustice?
Something's wrong?"

02:13.233 --> 02:15.969
"There's a crime that's happened.
Ooh!"

02:15.969 --> 02:21.007
In Glasgow, the centre of crime.
Ooh, he's drawn in.

02:21.007 --> 02:25.078
Man in Gilchrist murdered,
bludgeoned to the head.

02:25.078 --> 02:27.881
Good word, by the way, "bludgeoned".

02:27.881 --> 02:31.084
Beaten to death for a diamond brooch.

02:31.084 --> 02:34.587
Someone's been arrested.
His name? Oscar Slater.

02:34.587 --> 02:40.226
A German!
(with accent) "Yes, I am a German."

02:41.160 --> 02:43.596
Good accent. "Yes!"

02:43.596 --> 02:47.800
"That's how German people speak."

02:47.800 --> 02:49.836
You're absolutely correct, Oscar.

02:49.836 --> 02:53.907
Slater's been caught
trying to sell a diamond brooch.

02:53.907 --> 02:57.010
Ooh, Slater. It's not looking good.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.678
The police bring him in.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.847
(with accent) "You! Yeah, you!"

03:00.847 --> 03:05.985
"Yeah, you, mate. You're
under arrest, mate, for da murder."

03:05.985 --> 03:09.122
"Yes, I've done bad things."

03:09.122 --> 03:12.358
"But I have not stolen
this diamond brooch."

03:12.358 --> 03:18.064
"We know.
You, you tried to pawn that brooch!"

03:18.064 --> 03:21.134
"No, mate!
It's my girlfriend's brooch."

03:21.134 --> 03:24.270
"Not the murdered woman's brooch!"

03:24.270 --> 03:27.373
"And bear in mind, I'm German."

03:31.511 --> 03:35.148
"We all agree. You're lying, mate."

03:35.148 --> 03:38.518
"And we sentence you to jail."

03:40.954 --> 03:45.158
So off he goes to jail
for the rest of his life.

03:45.158 --> 03:50.530
Cut to Edinburgh. Sir Arthur
Dr Conan the Barbarian Doyle

03:50.530 --> 03:55.668
realises, "What this case needs
is someone like Sherlock Holmes."

03:55.668 --> 03:59.405
"Who writes Sherlock Holmes?
This motherfucker!"

03:59.405 --> 04:03.910
"I can do this. I can prove
that this man is innocent."

04:03.910 --> 04:07.847
Strides out the room.
He travels to Glasgow.

04:07.847 --> 04:10.350
He goes down to the crime scene.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.885
"You can't go through.
It's a crime scene."

04:12.885 --> 04:14.787
(American accent) "Oh, can't I?"

04:14.787 --> 04:20.593
"A: I'm a sir, B: I'm a doctor,
C: My name is Conan!"

04:20.593 --> 04:24.564
"As in the barbarian!"

04:24.564 --> 04:27.667
And suddenly,
he's surveying this shit

04:27.667 --> 04:30.903
in a way that Sherlock Holmes
would see it.

04:30.903 --> 04:35.241
"Ooh. Beaten to death
by a hammer, I see."

04:35.241 --> 04:39.812
"Ugh! This hammer is the size
of a toffee hammer!"

04:39.812 --> 04:42.248
"That is not a big enough hammer."

04:42.248 --> 04:47.186
He said, "Oh! There's a chair
over there that's covered in blood."

04:47.186 --> 04:53.092
"Maybe she was beat to death
by a chair that's covered in blood."

04:53.092 --> 04:55.561
No shit, Sherlock!

04:55.561 --> 04:59.766
Like, literally, that's where
that saying was invented!

04:59.766 --> 05:01.234
And as he gets to the door,

05:01.234 --> 05:04.604
and this is where he is
Sherlocking this shit,

05:04.604 --> 05:07.907
this is where Cumberbatch
gets his BAFTA.

05:07.907 --> 05:13.746
"Oh! Hello!
The door was opened from the inside."

05:13.746 --> 05:18.384
He calls it. He's like, "Dudes,
if someone was let into the flat,

05:18.384 --> 05:21.654
then she must have known
who killed her."

05:21.654 --> 05:25.925
"And she did not know Oscar Slater."

05:25.925 --> 05:30.863
So, clearly,
that motherfucker be innocent!

05:30.863 --> 05:33.232
"Nailed it!"

05:33.232 --> 05:36.202
He fucking moonwalks
out of that crime scene.

05:37.670 --> 05:43.242
It cannot have been Oscar Slater.
Ooh, sensation in the press.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.511
We're talking front-page headlines.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.313
(reads)

05:48.881 --> 05:51.651
Which is barely a fucking pun.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.953
(reads)

06:04.397 --> 06:06.165
(laughs)

06:06.165 --> 06:08.167
(snorts)

06:09.535 --> 06:13.706
And yet, do they release him? No.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.075
A few years pass.

06:16.075 --> 06:18.945
Doyle, like, loses interest.

06:18.945 --> 06:21.414
He's like, "Yeah, all this shit,

06:21.414 --> 06:24.984
but I'm gonna just
write me some books."

06:24.984 --> 06:26.919
"So, like, ugh!"

06:26.919 --> 06:30.256
Oscar Slater, he's stuck in prison.

06:30.256 --> 06:35.795
He's learning the fucking harmonica,
for, like, 11 long years.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.334
Like, what has happened to you
in 11 years?

06:41.334 --> 06:43.970
Camera dude,
what were you doing 11 years ago?

06:43.970 --> 06:47.907
Camera. You wanted to do camera
and now you are!

06:47.907 --> 06:50.610
What were YOU doing 11 years ago?
Camera.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.479
You wanted to do camera
and now you are doing camera.

06:53.479 --> 06:57.083
All we're getting is we've got
a very dedicated camera team.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.585
If you live your dreams,
you can do it.

06:59.585 --> 07:03.823
And if you want to be on camera,
start now. It's gonna take 11 years.

07:03.823 --> 07:07.627
Oscar Slater, of course
he's got that cartoon beard,

07:07.627 --> 07:11.597
but the cartoon beard
we're imagining is twice as long

07:11.597 --> 07:15.968
and twice as expensive
for your costume department.

07:15.968 --> 07:20.106
But it is huge. It curls
all the way round his body

07:20.106 --> 07:23.509
and right into his arsehole.
(guffaws)

07:33.286 --> 07:37.523
Suddenly, Oscar Slater,
he reaches desperation point.

07:37.523 --> 07:39.625
He comes up with a plan.

07:39.625 --> 07:43.396
"I'm gonna write a note
on, like, waterproof paper."

07:43.396 --> 07:47.033
"'I'm upset about being in prison.'"

07:47.033 --> 07:50.803
"I'm gonna tuck it under
my friend's tongue, William Gordon."

07:50.803 --> 07:53.406
Yeah, we haven't
heard that name before.

07:53.406 --> 07:57.076
"He's my housemate.
Here he is. Hello, William."

07:57.076 --> 07:59.846
(with Welsh accent)
"Hello! My mate."

07:59.846 --> 08:04.517
"I am from the country of Wales,
apparently."

08:04.517 --> 08:09.322
"That's good to know, because
we didn't know where you were from."

08:09.322 --> 08:12.959
"Yes. I am due for release."

08:12.959 --> 08:15.928
"Out I go into the wild world."

08:15.928 --> 08:19.599
"Will you smuggle
this message for me?"

08:19.599 --> 08:22.535
"How do you feel about that,
William Gordon?"

08:22.535 --> 08:26.239
(mumbling)
"Yeah, I thought so, brother."

08:26.239 --> 08:28.174
"You're down with that."

08:28.174 --> 08:31.244
So poor William Gordon
gets out there

08:31.244 --> 08:34.614
to Sir Arthur Conan
the Barbarian Dr Doyle.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.249
He gives him the message.

08:36.249 --> 08:39.051
(mumbles indistinctly)

08:39.051 --> 08:40.919
"For fuck's sake, William."

08:40.919 --> 08:43.655
"You could've taken
the message out days ago."

08:43.655 --> 08:44.957
He opens the letter

08:44.957 --> 08:49.161
and he reads his message
on fucking waterproof paper.

08:49.161 --> 08:52.131
He's like, "Oh, my God!
This guy's still here."

08:52.131 --> 08:57.069
"This guy is still in the game.
THAT's why Sherlock had Watson."

08:57.069 --> 09:00.773
"To remind him to not be
an arsehole!"

09:00.773 --> 09:04.343
"Urgh! I should've had a Watson."

09:04.343 --> 09:07.847
"Where was Martin Freeman? Urgh!"

09:07.847 --> 09:10.283
So Arthur Conan Doyle realises,

09:10.283 --> 09:13.452
"I've not forgotten about you,
Oscar Slater."

09:13.452 --> 09:15.788
And he write letters to,
like, Parliament

09:15.788 --> 09:18.157
and, like, people in the press.

09:18.157 --> 09:20.993
And everyone gets excited,
and there's a movement

09:20.993 --> 09:23.496
and everyone wants him
to be free.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.865
It's like, "Let's do this!"

09:28.167 --> 09:29.969
And it works.

09:29.969 --> 09:34.707
And he's released November 1927.

09:34.707 --> 09:38.210
But that was not enough
for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.279
He said, "Yeah, you've released him,

09:40.279 --> 09:43.349
but you've had him
for 18-and-a-half years."

09:43.349 --> 09:46.085
"Let's get that shit pardoned!"

09:46.085 --> 09:48.788
And they said,
"That's gonna cost money."

09:48.788 --> 09:51.724
So Doyle is like, "I've got this."

09:51.724 --> 09:55.227
He pays for the lawyers,
he pays for the trial.

09:55.227 --> 09:58.631
"I want a full pardon,
motherfudgers!"

09:58.631 --> 10:00.599
And did they get their pardon?

10:01.467 --> 10:04.370
No. No, they didn't.

10:06.172 --> 10:10.576
But they did get offered
six grand in compensation.

10:10.576 --> 10:13.312
So... they took that.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.850
Doyle spent all his money
to get this guy off,

10:17.850 --> 10:20.052
and now he wants reimbursing
for it.

10:20.052 --> 10:23.923
He says, "Look.
Can I get some refund, for this?"

10:23.923 --> 10:26.125
Slater turns round and says...

10:27.426 --> 10:30.096
"Swivel on it, bitch!"

10:30.096 --> 10:34.934
"Yo' ain't gonna see this shit!"

10:34.934 --> 10:38.070
"Off you go! Unlucky, Conan."

10:38.070 --> 10:41.207
"Ya fucking bitch!"

10:48.414 --> 10:50.416
(splutters, laughs)

10:53.652 --> 10:58.190
'From this toilet, Watson, I deduce
that Tom Parry has shat his pants

10:58.190 --> 11:00.159
and pissed over the seat.'

11:00.159 --> 11:04.196
'We'll be back after a break.
Join us for more legless history.'

11:04.196 --> 11:08.334
"That was my favourite leg!"
"I loved that leg!"

11:08.334 --> 11:10.403
"You poor son of a bitch!"

11:12.004 --> 11:12.204
.

11:14.707 --> 11:14.907
.

11:15.875 --> 11:20.079
'Welcome back to Drunk History,
comedians telling historical tales

11:20.079 --> 11:22.815
that should be taken
with a pinch of salt.'

11:22.815 --> 11:25.785
'Hang on, I'm thinking
of tequila shots.'

11:25.785 --> 11:28.187
'Time for our second story
of the evening.'

11:28.187 --> 11:30.256
'If all you know about Waterloo

11:30.256 --> 11:33.559
is being forced to watch
Mamma Mia! by your missus,

11:33.559 --> 11:35.795
then prepare to be educated.'

11:35.795 --> 11:38.531
'Here's Elis James and John Robins

11:38.531 --> 11:42.068
doubling up after
a bellyful of ale and rum.

11:42.068 --> 11:46.105
Well, we're going to tell you
about the Battle of Waterloo,

11:46.105 --> 11:50.042
June 18th, I think, 1815.

11:50.042 --> 11:53.345
One of the greatest of battles
in British military...

11:53.345 --> 11:57.783
You're the best battle
in military history. Thank you.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.185
Battle of Waterloo.

11:59.185 --> 12:04.190
Two characters,
Wellington and Napoleon.

12:04.190 --> 12:07.593
Wellington, cold, to an extent,
emotionless.

12:07.593 --> 12:10.863
Also, not a lot of people know this,
Irish.

12:10.863 --> 12:14.133
Napoleon, erratic, unpredictable.

12:14.133 --> 12:18.003
Short? He's actually 5'6".
He's Elis's height.

12:18.003 --> 12:19.238
Which is fine.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.708
Basically, Duke of Wellington
hates Napoleon.

12:22.708 --> 12:28.147
They're both classed as the twin
military geniuses of their age,

12:28.147 --> 12:32.551
and yet they're so different.
Napoleon was, erm...

12:32.551 --> 12:36.155
Commander of the French Army
at the age of 26.

12:36.155 --> 12:39.358
What were you doing at 26?
Temping. Exactly!

12:39.358 --> 12:44.029
He had failed to invade Russia
and was exiled to Elba.

12:44.029 --> 12:48.200
Just off the coast of Italy,
by the rest of Europe.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.570
And they are hoping that
that's where he'll stay,

12:51.570 --> 12:55.708
he's not going to create
more trouble, and that is that,

12:55.708 --> 12:58.144
Napoleon, as a problem,
is dealt with!

12:58.144 --> 13:03.282
The Duke of Wellington, when
he heard that Napoleon was in exile,

13:03.282 --> 13:05.784
he apparently did
the flamenco dance.

13:05.784 --> 13:08.687
So he'd have been like...
(Spanish music)

13:11.023 --> 13:14.593
(Irish accent) "That's the best
news I've heard all day."

13:15.494 --> 13:18.197
"Thrilled to bits!"

13:18.197 --> 13:20.766
Is that a flamenco dance?
Absolutely.

13:20.766 --> 13:26.839
What I find amazing about Napoleon
is when he's exiled on Elba,

13:26.839 --> 13:30.943
instead of just sort of...
What's the thing into obscurity?

13:30.943 --> 13:33.546
What's the word?
Something into obscurity.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.915
Melting?
Yeah, melting.

13:35.915 --> 13:39.318
He escapes from Elba,
gets back on to the mainland,

13:39.318 --> 13:42.488
and he then marches to Paris.

13:42.488 --> 13:47.359
And Louis XVIII keeps sending
groups of troops

13:47.359 --> 13:50.763
to meet him and stop him,
and at every meeting,

13:50.763 --> 13:54.033
Napoleon says,
"Shoot me now or join me."

13:54.033 --> 13:56.569
And some of them says,

13:56.569 --> 13:59.405
"Well, I'm... not quite...
clear on you.

13:59.405 --> 14:01.240
What are your interests?"

14:01.240 --> 14:05.010
"I enjoy marching, into paintball."

14:06.212 --> 14:08.347
"In a big way."
(chuckles)

14:08.347 --> 14:13.118
And they say, "OK, fair enough.
The paintball swung it for me."

14:13.118 --> 14:16.589
And they love him
so they join him... Ballsy move.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.490
And then he's got an army

14:18.490 --> 14:22.127
with which he can then become
Emperor of France again.

14:22.127 --> 14:24.630
So, the Duke of Wellington,

14:24.630 --> 14:27.833
he's found out that Napoleon
has escaped Elba.

14:27.833 --> 14:30.436
He's livid. He thinks that Napoleon

14:30.436 --> 14:33.772
is a major threat
to the British Isles.

14:33.772 --> 14:38.877
He's like, "To be honest, like,
if it's me versus Napoleon..."

14:38.877 --> 14:43.515
"Boom! We'll take him on.
Yes! Yes! Yes!"

14:43.515 --> 14:47.486
So he sorts out an alliance,
an allied army,

14:47.486 --> 14:53.359
of British, Prussians,
erm, the Belgians.

14:53.359 --> 14:55.094
There were others.

14:55.094 --> 14:57.930
They're psyched up.
They wanna get rid of Napoleon.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.598
He is a bad guy.

15:03.869 --> 15:08.807
Basically, it's 18th June 1815,

15:08.807 --> 15:10.609
and Waterloo, it's on.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.911
Wallop!
Wallop?

15:12.911 --> 15:14.680
Wallop.
Are you Ray Winstone?

15:14.680 --> 15:16.715
No. Carry on.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.083
So what happened was...

15:18.083 --> 15:21.387
I'm going to employ
a whiteboard at this point.

15:23.188 --> 15:26.392
I'm going to use red
for Wellington.

15:26.392 --> 15:30.396
And Napoleon is here.

15:30.396 --> 15:33.999
And his classic battle tactic

15:33.999 --> 15:37.236
is the, er, shot... line.

15:37.236 --> 15:41.106
Yeah, have a couple of Sambucas,
knobs out, see what happens.

15:41.106 --> 15:46.478
Absolutely not. He circles...
people with a thin front line

15:46.478 --> 15:51.750
and cut them off from the place
they get their supplies from.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.886
So he goes up...

15:56.388 --> 16:00.959
This is the absolute fulcrum
of the Battle of Waterloo,

16:00.959 --> 16:05.197
is that the Prussians
are retreating in parallel.

16:05.197 --> 16:08.133
Wellington, at this point,
goes to a ball.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.469
He's at the ball.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.905
He gets a note saying that Napoleon

16:12.905 --> 16:15.374
has advanced much further
than he thought.

16:15.374 --> 16:17.876
So he leaves the ball immediately.

16:17.876 --> 16:22.081
His girlfriend's saying,
"You always leave parties."

16:22.081 --> 16:26.552
"And..." "Yes, I do, cos I'm
the bloody Duke of Wellington!"

16:26.552 --> 16:29.455
"But these are my friends."
"I'm going!"

16:29.455 --> 16:32.157
"You never make an effort
with my friends."

16:32.157 --> 16:35.527
"I don't care about your friends.
I love you."

16:35.527 --> 16:37.863
"YOU'RE the one I love!"

16:37.863 --> 16:40.766
"I've talked
to all of your friends."

16:40.766 --> 16:45.037
"You couldn't, on this one day,
hang out with my friends."

16:45.037 --> 16:50.709
"I know, and I'm sorry.
I said I was sorry. I AM sorry."

16:50.709 --> 16:54.346
"You love Napoleon more than me."
"No, absolutely not."

16:54.346 --> 16:57.282
"I hate Napoleon."
"You're obsessed with him."

16:57.282 --> 17:00.085
"I did the flamenco. It was great."

17:00.085 --> 17:02.588
"You've never done
the flamenco for me!"

17:02.588 --> 17:05.891
"I know! Because I wasn't glad
you were in exile."

17:05.891 --> 17:08.127
"You never give me compliments."

17:08.127 --> 17:11.329
"You just say,
'I'm glad I'm not in exile.'"

17:11.329 --> 17:14.133
"You've got to understand
my state of mind."

17:14.133 --> 17:18.670
"I am fighting Napoleon.
I need two days, three days tops."

17:18.670 --> 17:23.175
"And we can carry on and I can
give you all the attention."

17:23.175 --> 17:24.410
"How's that sound?"

17:24.410 --> 17:27.913
"Do you promise?"
"Yes, I absolutely promise."

17:27.913 --> 17:31.517
"OK."
"Can I leave the party now?"

17:31.517 --> 17:33.452
"Yes, you can leave now."

17:33.452 --> 17:36.255
"Napoleon's coming!
Napoleon's coming!"

17:36.255 --> 17:38.624
Then Wellington leaves the ball.

17:38.624 --> 17:42.361
He goes back to the battlefield.
Battle's raging.

17:42.361 --> 17:44.963
Wellington is on his horse.

17:44.963 --> 17:48.400
His brother-in-law, Lord Uxbridge,
is also on his horse.

17:48.400 --> 17:53.405
And legend has it that
a cannonball hits Uxbridge's leg.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.507
Knocks it off.
Clean off.

17:55.507 --> 17:59.711
Lord Uxbridge goes,
"My God, sir! I've lost my leg."

17:59.711 --> 18:04.516
To which Wellington replies,
"My God, sir! So you have."

18:04.516 --> 18:08.120
I have a theory that
that is not what was said.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.824
Clearly, any human being
is gonna go...

18:11.824 --> 18:16.094
(screams) "Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!"

18:16.094 --> 18:19.565
"Oh, my God!
That was my favourite leg!"

18:19.565 --> 18:22.000
"I loved that leg!"

18:22.000 --> 18:25.671
And then Wellington would go,
"Jesus Christ!"

18:25.671 --> 18:29.575
"You poor son of a bitch!
You've lost your bastard leg!"

18:29.575 --> 18:32.211
"Oh, my God!"

18:32.211 --> 18:35.881
No-one says, "My dear,
my leg has just fallen off."

18:35.881 --> 18:38.650
Everyone screams and cries
until they're dead.

18:38.650 --> 18:43.489
So Wellington is having
a torrid time. Yeah.

18:43.489 --> 18:45.491
Absolute bloody nightmare.

18:45.491 --> 18:50.329
So, a major turning point
in the battle

18:50.329 --> 18:54.833
was the Scottish regiment,
who went absolutely mental.

18:54.833 --> 18:58.070
The Scottish are like,
"Fucking bring it on, mate!"

18:58.070 --> 19:00.572
"Bring it on! Know what I mean?"

19:00.572 --> 19:03.775
"I cannot understand.
What is this 'bring it on'?"

19:03.775 --> 19:07.279
"Mate, this is just Glasgow!"

19:07.279 --> 19:11.683
"Oh, my God!
Zis is worse than I ever imagined."

19:11.683 --> 19:14.286
Basically, the Scots have turned up.

19:14.286 --> 19:17.456
They have...
They've destroyed major stuff.

19:17.456 --> 19:21.527
So Napoleon, he realises
he's lost the Battle of Waterloo.

19:21.527 --> 19:25.364
He's like, "Sod this.
I'm gonna fuck off for a minute."

19:25.364 --> 19:29.401
He flees the battle.
He hides out in Paris.

19:29.401 --> 19:32.838
After a month,
Napoleon decides to surrender

19:32.838 --> 19:35.107
to the English on July 15th.

19:35.107 --> 19:39.077
His French troops hand him over
and they're all crying like,

19:39.077 --> 19:42.915
"Oh, Napoleon, Napoleon! Oh!"

19:42.915 --> 19:47.719
"Long vie..."
(French-sounding gibberish)

19:47.719 --> 19:50.155
Come on.
What?

19:50.155 --> 19:52.891
What?
Get stuck in, for crying out loud.

19:52.891 --> 19:56.562
So they hand him over
and the English forces are like,

19:56.562 --> 19:58.230
"Yes, please."

19:58.230 --> 20:02.568
So Napoleon thinks he's going
to be exiled to America.

20:02.568 --> 20:05.437
And he's like, "Wait. Fair enough."

20:05.437 --> 20:08.106
Which is French for "fair enough".

20:08.106 --> 20:11.910
"I'm going to America.
I'll have all zee American things."

20:11.910 --> 20:15.747
"I will have hotdogs,
American films."

20:15.747 --> 20:20.118
"Cafe, cafe au lait."
So the English say to him,

20:20.118 --> 20:25.924
"You're going to St Helena,
which is a remote island."

20:25.924 --> 20:29.962
A thousand-and-a-half miles from
Africa. There's nothing there.

20:29.962 --> 20:32.431
And he's like, "No, no, no, no."

20:32.431 --> 20:34.533
And the English are like,

20:34.533 --> 20:37.269
"You have absolutely
no say in this whatsoever."

20:37.269 --> 20:39.237
And he's like, "Come on!"

20:39.237 --> 20:42.374
"I'm bloody Napoleon,
for crying out loud!"

20:42.374 --> 20:48.146
So Napoleon is exiled.
Wallop! He's away.

20:48.146 --> 20:51.116
Wellington's like,
"Let's take advantage of this."

20:51.116 --> 20:54.786
I hate this guy."
So to add insult to injury,

20:54.786 --> 20:57.656
he went and shagged
a couple of his mistresses.

20:57.656 --> 21:01.593
"Absolute wallop. Bang, done."

21:10.369 --> 21:14.373
'Eagle-eyed viewers will have noted
that was the first time ever

21:14.373 --> 21:18.310
two comedians used a whiteboard
and neither drew a cock and balls.'

21:18.310 --> 21:19.745
'Goodnight.'
