Are you drunk?

00:01.984 --> 00:02.985
This ain't the way
it's gonna be.

00:03.019 --> 00:04.686
- Can he play?
- He loves football.

00:04.721 --> 00:05.821
He just doesn't know it yet.

00:05.855 --> 00:08.257
I came here to tell you

00:08.291 --> 00:11.560
that the whole thing
between you and me...

00:11.594 --> 00:12.693
You know Vince's dad?

00:12.729 --> 00:14.396
He was a drug dealer.
Used to be one of

00:14.430 --> 00:15.864
the baddest
cats we had in town.

00:15.898 --> 00:17.032
Tell me you're done
with the drugs.

00:17.066 --> 00:19.034
I will never
let that happen again.

00:19.068 --> 00:20.769
Luke, this is Karl Gage
from over at T.M.U.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.437
I'd like to sit down
with you sometime.

00:22.472 --> 00:24.373
Why don't we bring you over
to T.M.U.?

00:24.407 --> 00:26.108
You can look around the campus,
meet the coaches.

00:26.142 --> 00:27.276
Hello, Vincent.

00:27.310 --> 00:29.911
I'm the head coach here.

00:29.946 --> 00:32.447
Set, hut, hut.

00:35.318 --> 00:37.486
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

00:37.520 --> 00:38.754
I was gonna take it up the gap.

00:38.788 --> 00:39.855
What are the corners playing?

00:39.889 --> 00:41.290
- Cover two.
- Cover two.

00:41.324 --> 00:43.091
And in cover two, the tight end
is open between the safeties.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.126
So what the hell are you doing?

00:44.160 --> 00:45.327
I was gonna take it up the gap.

00:45.361 --> 00:46.862
I don't want you
taking it up the gap,

00:46.896 --> 00:48.263
'cause I don't want you running
eight yards and getting hit,

00:48.298 --> 00:49.665
'cause I'd like to go
to the playoffs this year.

00:49.699 --> 00:51.066
- Would you like to come with me?
- Yes, sir.

00:51.100 --> 00:52.234
Then don't take it up the gap.

00:52.268 --> 00:54.102
Do it my way,
stay in the pocket,

00:54.137 --> 00:56.171
make the read,
look for the slant.

00:56.205 --> 00:58.006
And if the slant's not there,
what do you do?

00:58.041 --> 00:59.708
- I dump it off to Luke.
- That's right.

00:59.742 --> 01:00.976
That's good, so let's do that.

01:01.010 --> 01:02.444
Line it up.

01:02.478 --> 01:04.546
Hey, you know what way
we're gonna do it, don't you?

01:04.580 --> 01:06.348
- Your way, coach.
- Every time.

01:06.382 --> 01:08.183
My way!

01:08.217 --> 01:09.351
Hut, hut.

01:11.754 --> 01:14.189
There you go.
Way to hang on.

01:14.223 --> 01:15.557
That's nice,
because what is that?

01:15.591 --> 01:16.591
What way is that?

01:16.626 --> 01:18.393
- Your way.
- That's my way.

01:18.428 --> 01:19.928
- The right way, coach.
- My way is the right way,

01:19.962 --> 01:21.196
the good way, the smart way.

01:21.230 --> 01:24.833
It's the path to salvation,
gentlemen.

01:24.867 --> 01:27.035
Three-step drop, coach?

01:30.740 --> 01:32.174
Boy's a natural scrambler.

01:32.208 --> 01:35.510
I don't know why you want
to put a leash on him.

01:35.545 --> 01:37.746
You're slipping, Karl.

01:43.086 --> 01:45.187
They said they've been
watching me since summer league.

01:45.221 --> 01:47.089
They wanted
a verbal commitment.

01:47.123 --> 01:48.757
They shouldn't even
be talking directly to you.

01:48.791 --> 01:49.758
You're a junior.

01:49.792 --> 01:50.892
I didn't know that.

01:50.927 --> 01:52.894
That guy Karl said
come in the room,

01:52.929 --> 01:54.096
and when I walked in they
were all just sitting there

01:54.130 --> 01:55.230
waiting to meet me.

01:55.264 --> 01:56.565
I said, "I thought you
wanted Cafferty."

01:56.599 --> 01:57.933
He said, "we do.

01:57.967 --> 01:59.434
We're talking
to you right now."

01:59.469 --> 02:01.370
It's a calf, cow.

02:01.404 --> 02:02.437
A what?

02:02.472 --> 02:04.539
Does anyone else
know about this?

02:04.574 --> 02:07.275
No.
Well, my mom and my dad.

02:07.310 --> 02:10.479
I guess that's it.

02:10.513 --> 02:13.348
How's that going with your dad?

02:13.383 --> 02:17.185
Found some middle ground.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.588
Good.

02:19.622 --> 02:21.289
Are they gonna be
up there for the game?

02:21.324 --> 02:26.495
No, my mom's gotta work,
but my dad'll be there.

02:26.529 --> 02:27.963
I'll tell you what,

02:27.997 --> 02:29.865
once we all get up there,
you, me, and your dad

02:29.899 --> 02:31.433
are gonna get together
and we're gonna

02:31.467 --> 02:33.268

02:33.302 --> 02:34.503
Sounds good.

02:34.537 --> 02:35.937
Does Luke know about this?

02:35.972 --> 02:38.240
No, it's his moment.

02:38.274 --> 02:40.475
Didn't want to take it
away from him.

02:40.510 --> 02:43.745
Keep it that way.

02:43.780 --> 02:45.947
Everybody have a seat!

02:45.982 --> 02:47.082
Have a seat now!
Let's go!

02:53.489 --> 02:56.591
Thank you, coach.

02:56.626 --> 02:58.994
We're gonna take
a little road trip, gentlemen.

03:03.299 --> 03:06.868
South King High School

03:06.903 --> 03:09.504
south and east of where we are.

03:09.539 --> 03:11.206
It may sound like fun now,

You'll notice there's
a lack of down time.

03:32.662 --> 03:34.663
You'll also notice
we've carved out

03:34.697 --> 03:36.731
study time.

03:36.766 --> 03:38.166
- You good?
- Yeah, we're good.

03:38.201 --> 03:39.367
Hey, guys.

03:39.402 --> 03:41.236
Hey, good work
this week so far.

03:41.270 --> 03:42.404

doing the talking around here,

03:53.516 --> 03:55.383
and I know who's not
doing the talking.

03:55.418 --> 03:57.953
I hear talk
about last year's forfeit,

03:57.987 --> 03:59.387
the season opener.

03:59.422 --> 04:01.189
I don't mind that.

04:01.224 --> 04:03.291
Go ahead and say it.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.027
But I don't want any talk about
revenge going on around here,

04:06.062 --> 04:07.329
'cause when you talk
about revenge

04:07.363 --> 04:08.997
and you're playing football
with revenge,

04:09.031 --> 04:12.934
you're playing stupid football,
and I'm not gonna have it.

04:12.969 --> 04:14.135

we'll stick to the game plan,

18:31.193 --> 18:33.194

in ham juice don't count.

18:33.228 --> 18:34.662
Oh, that's the best.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.430
I thought you were gonna
lay off on the pork, man,

18:36.465 --> 18:37.998
after I gave you my pig,
come on.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.501
Dude, pork and pig
is two different things.

18:40.535 --> 18:41.635
Wait, what?

18:41.670 --> 18:44.438
Pork is on a plate,
and pig ain't.

18:44.473 --> 18:46.240
All right.

18:46.274 --> 18:48.509
There's a lot of dude talk
going on out here.

18:48.543 --> 18:50.745
Ruckle, that's what
got you outta bed?

18:50.779 --> 18:52.146
No.

18:52.180 --> 18:56.751
Buddy Jr.,
he's a really loud snorer.

18:56.785 --> 18:59.787
Like a lactose-intolerant
ass face or something.

19:00.822 --> 19:02.189
What are you doing?

19:02.224 --> 19:03.624
We're just taking in the beauty

19:03.658 --> 19:05.459
of Kingdom, Texas, sir.

19:05.494 --> 19:06.460
The beauty?

19:06.495 --> 19:08.529
You mean no bars

19:08.563 --> 19:10.831
and 9,000 churches,
that kinda beauty?

19:10.866 --> 19:14.201
Sounds like
you've been here before.

19:14.236 --> 19:17.004
Yeah, my dad's worked
on a few rigs.

19:17.038 --> 19:21.909
We never stayed here
that long, but...

19:21.943 --> 19:23.944
As usual.

19:26.481 --> 19:29.350
So Vince, think we're
gonna win that game tomorrow?

19:29.384 --> 19:32.052
Yeah, we got beat pretty bad,

19:32.087 --> 19:34.555
but we're not the same team.

19:34.589 --> 19:37.558
That's true.

19:37.592 --> 19:39.794
I heard you guys forfeited.

19:39.828 --> 19:41.896
What's up with that?

19:44.399 --> 19:46.033
It was a bad feeling.

19:46.067 --> 19:48.202
But coach Taylor,
he's a, you know,

19:48.236 --> 19:49.603
he's a straight-up guy.

19:49.638 --> 19:51.806
He had his reasons.
Just don't know what they are.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.809
Dude, I can tell you...
I can tell you the reasons,

19:54.843 --> 19:56.343
'cause y'all didn't have me
on the team, so...

19:56.378 --> 19:58.179
Okay.

19:58.213 --> 20:00.181
Yeah, well,

20:00.215 --> 20:03.184
maybe I can contribute
a little something too now.

20:03.218 --> 20:04.985
Well, you had me.

20:05.020 --> 20:07.521
I guess that didn't help.

20:07.556 --> 20:08.689
But I tell you what,

20:08.723 --> 20:09.890
you know what
I could get used to?

20:09.925 --> 20:10.891
What?

20:10.926 --> 20:12.993
The free candy at the minibar.

20:13.028 --> 20:14.595
And the two pillows that I got.

20:14.629 --> 20:16.730
Hey, that candy's not free.

20:16.765 --> 20:18.799
- It's not?

20:18.834 --> 20:20.935
No. And that porn
ain't either.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.570
Porn is not free?

20:22.604 --> 20:24.438
No, in fact
it's pretty expensive.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.606
Are you sure?

20:25.640 --> 20:27.741
Uh, yeah.

20:27.776 --> 20:29.610
All right,
'cause my roommate's in there

20:29.644 --> 20:31.078
having, like, a film festival.

20:31.112 --> 20:33.013
So let me go tell him
to stop, all right?

20:33.048 --> 20:35.282
All right, word.
Hey, dude, stop being mean.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.784
Come on, now.

20:36.818 --> 20:39.386
- This is crazy, man.
- Yeah.

20:41.389 --> 20:43.357
Good night.

20:43.391 --> 20:44.458
All right, I'm out.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.459
- You are?
- Yeah.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.262
Hey, tomorrow, Buddy.

20:48.296 --> 20:49.597
Tomorrow.

20:49.631 --> 20:51.565
All right.

20:54.970 --> 20:56.971
Tomorrow.

21:07.482 --> 21:08.816
Late in the second half,

21:08.850 --> 21:09.850
the Lions down by three,

21:09.885 --> 21:11.385
and they are getting no respect

21:11.419 --> 21:12.620
from these Kingdom rangers.

21:12.654 --> 21:13.687
Tempers are running hot.

21:13.722 --> 21:15.789
And this game has been filled

21:15.824 --> 21:19.460
with trash talking
and unnecessary penalties.

21:19.494 --> 21:20.728
Rangers with the ball.

21:20.762 --> 21:22.997
First and goal
on the Lion's nine.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.366
Gives to rich Roberts
up the middle.

21:25.900 --> 21:27.334
Here we go!

21:27.368 --> 21:29.469
Stacked up for maybe
a gain of three.

21:29.504 --> 21:32.839
Oh, and a late hit
on Luke Cafferty!

21:32.874 --> 21:35.642
Q.B. Andy "Spank, Spank" Miller
on a sneak,

21:35.676 --> 21:38.311
and he gets in easy.

21:38.346 --> 21:40.747
It's been a slogger
of a first half, folks.

21:40.782 --> 21:43.183
Neither team's offense
is setting the world on fire,

21:43.217 --> 21:45.652
but south king's
just grabbed some big mo

21:45.686 --> 21:47.888
before the half.
17-7 for the home team,

21:47.922 --> 21:49.423
kicking off.

21:49.457 --> 21:50.690
Kickoff return, let's go!

21:53.027 --> 21:54.428
All right, let's go, boys!

21:56.564 --> 21:58.665
Let's go, B.J.!
You get 'em, baby!

21:58.699 --> 22:01.768
Chill out, dad.

22:01.803 --> 22:03.336
Here's the kick.

22:03.371 --> 22:04.771
A squib down the middle.

22:04.806 --> 22:07.874
Number 42, Buddy Garrity Jr.,
needs to just fall on this one.

22:07.909 --> 22:09.743
Get on the ball!
Get on the ball!

22:09.777 --> 22:11.178
Pick it up!
Run with it, baby!

22:11.212 --> 22:12.179
Run with it!
Run with it! Yeah!

22:12.213 --> 22:13.180
Fall on it!

22:13.214 --> 22:15.515
Fall on it!

22:15.550 --> 22:17.317
Oh, and Junior
absolutely laid out

22:17.351 --> 22:18.919
by a vicious hit.

22:18.953 --> 22:20.787
And coach Eric Taylor
is beside himself,

22:20.822 --> 22:22.756
and I don't blame him.

22:22.790 --> 22:24.057
Not cool.

22:24.092 --> 22:25.659
Mess with 42 again...
That's my boy.

22:25.693 --> 22:27.027
Don't tag him, don't tag him,

22:27.061 --> 22:28.061
or I'll tag you back!

22:28.096 --> 22:29.196
Clean hit.

22:29.230 --> 22:30.530
You're calling that
a clean hit?

22:30.565 --> 22:32.432
What rule book are you
playing from tonight?

22:32.467 --> 22:33.867
Sure does seem like these refs

22:33.901 --> 22:36.236
aren't calling it
both ways tonight, folks.

22:36.270 --> 22:37.370
Take a knee.

22:37.405 --> 22:38.538
We're on the 40.
I can...

22:38.573 --> 22:41.308
Take a knee.

22:41.342 --> 22:43.143
Still two seconds on the clock.

22:43.177 --> 22:44.878
Let's see what Taylor
will do now.

22:45.980 --> 22:47.447
New year, same team!

22:47.482 --> 22:48.949
Buncha doormats!

22:48.983 --> 22:50.250
Yeah, I'm talking
to you, Howard!

22:50.284 --> 22:52.319
You're in Kingdom now, baby!

22:52.353 --> 22:53.887
Take that knee
like I know you can!

22:53.921 --> 22:54.955
Come on!

22:54.989 --> 22:56.556

22:56.591 --> 22:58.225
Let's go, let's take it in.

22:58.259 --> 23:01.595
And that'll do it,
17-7, Kingdom at the half,

23:01.629 --> 23:05.232
in a game these referees need
to get under control fast.

23:05.266 --> 23:06.600
Let's go, come on now.

23:06.634 --> 23:08.335
I'm gonna rip
somebody's head off.

23:08.369 --> 23:10.070
They want to play dirty,
we're gonna show 'em dirty.

23:10.104 --> 23:11.338
They're out there
chop blocking.

23:11.372 --> 23:12.939
I got horse-collared by 56.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.608
All right, we're getting
a little home cooked out there,

23:14.642 --> 23:16.676
but we gotta
rise above that, guys.

23:16.711 --> 23:18.011
Something's gotta change,
all this in the pocket,

23:18.045 --> 23:19.246
one step, two step
ain't working.

23:19.280 --> 23:20.947
Listen to me.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.350
This is exactly what I meant
about playing with revenge.

23:23.384 --> 23:24.784
That team out there

23:24.819 --> 23:26.119
is not a better team.

23:26.154 --> 23:28.688
They are not a better team.

23:28.723 --> 23:30.924
You take away
the mental mistakes,

23:30.958 --> 23:32.759
and we are back in this thing.

23:32.793 --> 23:35.362
Otherwise, they are gonna
keep playing us

23:35.396 --> 23:38.365
for a bunch of fools.

38-17, East Dillon.

27:26.260 --> 27:28.428
Kingdom come,
Kingdom conquered.

27:30.364 --> 27:32.632
A big win to stay undefeated
for these Lions.

27:32.666 --> 27:36.102
But more importantly,
the team stood up and said,

27:36.137 --> 27:37.771
"we will not be disrespected,

27:37.805 --> 27:39.339
not tonight."

27:39.373 --> 27:41.241
I wonder how
he explains this one.

27:42.943 --> 27:46.312
Coach, 24 total penalties
for 245 yards.

27:46.347 --> 27:47.747
Now, that's got
to be a league record.

27:47.782 --> 27:49.716
There were penalties
on both sides.

27:49.750 --> 27:51.418
Yeah, but most of them were
for unsportsmanlike conduct,

27:51.452 --> 27:53.186
and most of them
were on your team.

27:53.220 --> 27:54.287
They started this whole mess.

27:54.321 --> 27:55.755
You guys just finished it,
right?

27:55.790 --> 27:57.624
Is that the style you're gonna
play this year, thug ball?

27:57.658 --> 27:58.925
You know what?

27:58.959 --> 28:00.260
It's always good
talking to you two.

28:00.294 --> 28:01.594
Hey, hold on, hold on.
Come on, coach.

28:01.629 --> 28:02.796
We got a long bus ride.
We'll see you.

28:02.830 --> 28:05.365
Why are you guys
so undisciplined, coach?

28:18.746 --> 28:21.681
Are you in charge?

28:21.715 --> 28:23.016
I'm glad you won
your soccer game,

28:23.050 --> 28:24.851
but I need you to tone it down.

28:24.885 --> 28:27.253
I can't accept this.

28:27.288 --> 28:28.655
I need y'all to please...

28:28.689 --> 28:31.458
Hi, hi. It's okay.
Go on through, thanks.

28:31.492 --> 28:33.293
If you could get into your
rooms though, that'd be great,

28:33.327 --> 28:34.394
and just keep
the celebration down.

28:34.428 --> 28:36.296
- Thank you.
- Sorry about that

28:36.330 --> 28:39.065
Thank you so much.

28:39.099 --> 28:40.233
Just dial zero.

28:40.267 --> 28:41.434
Okay.

28:49.510 --> 28:51.778
- Good game.
- Thank you.

28:51.812 --> 28:54.747
Also like to see you
on private time.

28:54.782 --> 28:56.382
You had such a good game.

28:56.417 --> 28:57.750
Hmm?

28:57.785 --> 28:59.152
Don't even look over there.

Get away from the...

a little early, that's all.

29:08.596 --> 29:09.596
Early?

29:09.630 --> 29:10.997
Yeah.

29:11.031 --> 29:12.832
They think we were
gonna go out and...

29:12.867 --> 29:14.434
I thought we were
supposed to hang out.

29:14.468 --> 29:17.003

We are gonna go.

Look at 'em.

for an hour or two, I promise.

29:22.776 --> 29:24.944
I'm coming right back.

29:24.979 --> 29:26.346

- Mm-hmm.

29:26.380 --> 29:28.147

29:28.182 --> 29:29.382
Mm.

29:29.416 --> 29:31.251

can you just not lock this?

29:31.285 --> 29:32.585
Just leave it unlocked.

29:32.620 --> 29:34.821

an hour or two, okay?

29:34.855 --> 29:37.156
Baby, I'm...

29:37.191 --> 29:38.992
Mm, yeah.

29:39.026 --> 29:42.896
So are we just gonna
drive around all night

29:42.930 --> 29:45.398
or are you actually
gonna take me somewhere?

29:45.432 --> 29:47.133
I'm showing you
how to get lost.

29:47.167 --> 29:49.936
Well, you seem
to be succeeding.

29:49.970 --> 29:52.105
I'm not gonna be able
to stay out much longer.

29:52.139 --> 29:54.941
I gotta get home
and work on my thesis.

29:54.975 --> 29:58.077
So what are you doing
at Burleson?

29:58.112 --> 30:00.079
What are you doing at Burleson?

30:00.114 --> 30:03.616
That's not fair.
I asked you first.

30:03.651 --> 30:05.785
All right, same time.

30:05.819 --> 30:08.688
One, two, three.

30:08.722 --> 30:11.391
I'm here because
no Ivy League school...

30:11.425 --> 30:12.959
I'm at Burleson because
I couldn't hack it...

30:12.993 --> 30:14.627
Wanted to give me a shot,
and Burleson offered my wife

30:14.662 --> 30:17.830
an adjunct professorship,
and they wanted her so bad

30:17.865 --> 30:19.632
that they allowed me
into the doctoral program...

30:19.667 --> 30:21.534
And I guess it's
far enough away from Matt.

30:21.569 --> 30:23.102
Even though I had
a ridiculous thesis.

30:31.879 --> 30:35.048
Her name's Alison.

30:35.082 --> 30:36.816
She's very smart

30:36.850 --> 30:39.352
and very good at what she does.

30:39.386 --> 30:43.289
We like each other,
but we don't love each other.

30:43.324 --> 30:46.459
Maybe it's the other way
around, I don't know.

30:48.929 --> 30:51.798
Who's Matt?

30:51.832 --> 30:56.102
He's, uh...

30:56.136 --> 30:59.372
Just this guy in Chicago.

31:21.095 --> 31:22.829
Okay, quit getting grease
on the cards.

31:22.863 --> 31:25.331
You keep saying that.
There's no grease on the cards.

31:25.366 --> 31:27.333
Everybody, hey, seriously,
I just wanted to say real quick,

31:27.368 --> 31:29.202
hell of a freakin'
game tonight.

31:29.236 --> 31:31.904
Coach, congratulations.
Congratulations to everybody.

31:31.939 --> 31:33.840
Old-school football.

31:33.874 --> 31:36.009
We beat the piss outta them,
and I loved every minute of it.

31:36.043 --> 31:38.511
And I liked the revenge sticks.

31:38.545 --> 31:40.580
There were some good sticks.

31:40.614 --> 31:42.181
There were.

31:42.216 --> 31:44.083
We let that game get
away from us.

31:44.118 --> 31:45.618
- What?
- What do you mean?

31:45.653 --> 31:47.286
Game got away from us
a little bit.

31:47.321 --> 31:48.721
That's how
it should be played, coach.

31:48.756 --> 31:50.189
No, I didn't like all that.
I didn't like all that.

31:50.224 --> 31:51.324

in the first half.

I understand that,
I'm just saying

31:54.128 --> 31:55.728
- it got away a little bit.
- They were playing dirty.

31:55.763 --> 31:56.829
See y'all in the morning.

36:29.303 --> 36:31.137
It's a great pig.

36:31.171 --> 36:32.705
Hastings, I bet
he could be my brother too,

36:32.739 --> 36:35.308
'cause his hair is like,
"bah, bah, bah, poof!"

36:35.342 --> 36:37.576
And then, like...

36:37.611 --> 36:40.579
And Buddy Jr.,
where are you, girl?

36:40.614 --> 36:43.349
- Buddy Jr.?
- Buddy?

36:43.383 --> 36:45.618
That man... Don't look at me.
Look at her.

36:45.652 --> 36:48.087
You are not gay.

36:48.121 --> 36:49.655
That man is sucking face
with someone's mom.

36:49.690 --> 36:51.590
You do it.

36:51.625 --> 36:53.159
He could be my brother too.

36:53.193 --> 36:56.529
And I will do anything for you.

36:56.563 --> 36:57.697
Like what?

36:57.731 --> 36:59.999
I will walk...

37:00.033 --> 37:02.034
I will walk on fire
for you guys.

37:02.069 --> 37:03.069
That's love.

37:03.103 --> 37:05.271
Really?

37:05.305 --> 37:06.439
You'd walk on fire?

37:06.473 --> 37:09.241
Mm-hmm.

37:11.378 --> 37:13.546
All right, prove it.

37:15.215 --> 37:17.249
- What?
- Hmm?

37:20.320 --> 37:22.588
Yeah.

37:29.997 --> 37:31.530
Is one of you Julie Taylor?

37:31.565 --> 37:33.032
Excuse me?

37:33.066 --> 37:34.600
I'm looking for Julie Taylor.

37:34.634 --> 37:35.901
Is she here?

37:35.936 --> 37:38.704
I'm Julie.
Who are you?

37:38.739 --> 37:40.006
Oh, my God, what the hell?

37:40.040 --> 37:41.407
What the hell
is wrong with you?

37:41.441 --> 37:44.143
I'm Alison!
Derek's my husband.

37:44.177 --> 37:45.811
Look, you need to work
issues out with...

37:45.846 --> 37:48.781
No, no, no, no, no.
You're not special.

37:48.815 --> 37:50.449
You're not the first.

37:50.484 --> 37:52.952
What you are
is a frickin' cliche

37:52.986 --> 37:54.253
and a slut.

37:54.287 --> 37:56.088
You stay away from him.

37:56.123 --> 37:58.724
Do you hear me?
You stay away from him!

37:58.759 --> 38:01.127
Julie Taylor is a slut!

38:01.161 --> 38:03.562
She is sleeping
with Derek Bishop,

38:03.597 --> 38:07.767
T.A. of the History Department
and my husband!

38:07.801 --> 38:11.137
Julie Taylor is a slut!

38:13.006 --> 38:16.675
Julie Taylor is a slut!

38:18.545 --> 38:22.181
Yeah.

38:23.517 --> 38:24.483
We all do it, ok?

38:24.518 --> 38:26.052
Okay?

38:26.086 --> 38:27.753
I just joined the team.

38:27.788 --> 38:30.089
No, all of us,
Buddy Jr., all right?

38:30.123 --> 38:32.124
Okay, all right.

38:32.159 --> 38:34.360
Do it, brother.

38:38.131 --> 38:39.565
Do it, do it.

38:39.599 --> 38:42.435
You're pinching me, biyatch.

38:50.811 --> 38:52.945
Doesn't look that fun actually.

38:52.979 --> 38:54.780
All right, who's next?

38:54.815 --> 38:57.316
You, Q.B.
You do it, man.

39:01.922 --> 39:03.389
That's the badge of our pride.

39:03.423 --> 39:06.292
It's, like, pride,
and, like, pride.

39:06.326 --> 39:07.593
You know, like...

39:07.627 --> 39:09.095
That's right.

39:09.129 --> 39:10.129
Idiots.

39:10.163 --> 39:12.364
Feels so nice on my cortex

39:12.399 --> 39:14.733
- every time you say that.
- Do you have to be so rough?

39:14.768 --> 39:16.035
Stop moving.

39:16.069 --> 39:17.670
If you wouldn't move,
I wouldn't be so rough.

39:17.704 --> 39:19.105
And she probably wouldn't yell.

39:19.139 --> 39:21.740
So much fun for me, you know?

39:21.775 --> 39:22.975
Wait up,

39:23.009 --> 39:26.178
watch the sunrise
until 5:00 in the morning.

39:26.213 --> 39:27.346
Jess.

39:27.380 --> 39:30.149
I am sorry.

39:30.183 --> 39:32.418
I will do whatever it takes

39:32.452 --> 39:34.086
to make it up to you.

39:34.121 --> 39:38.090
'Cause I love you so much.

39:38.125 --> 39:39.325
Get that all cleaned up?

39:39.359 --> 39:41.160
- She's standing up.
- I know.

39:41.194 --> 39:42.361
I see that.

39:42.395 --> 39:44.096
Daddy's home.

39:44.131 --> 39:46.499
Hey, honey.

39:49.970 --> 39:51.337
Hey.

39:51.371 --> 39:52.805
Come here!

39:52.839 --> 39:54.640
- Hi!
- How are you?

39:59.679 --> 40:01.780
I don't believe it!

40:01.815 --> 40:04.950
Hey, how are you?

40:04.985 --> 40:07.386
- I'm good.
- Good, good.

40:07.420 --> 40:08.721
Welcome to your home.

40:08.755 --> 40:10.890
- Hi, Gracie.
- What are you doing here?

40:10.924 --> 40:12.324
Gotta do some laundry.

40:12.359 --> 40:14.660
Hi! Hi!

40:14.694 --> 40:16.695
Hi, Gracie.

40:25.739 --> 40:28.040
Good job, son.
Here.

40:28.074 --> 40:29.074
Dad, I got it.

40:29.109 --> 40:30.876
All right.
All right.

40:30.911 --> 40:34.346
Good boy.
I'll see you later.

40:36.082 --> 40:37.650
Ah.

40:37.684 --> 40:39.818
- All right, be safe, okay?
- Later, bro.

40:39.853 --> 40:41.921
- I'll see you back at home.
- All right.

40:41.955 --> 40:43.589
- Proud of you.
- Thank you.

40:43.623 --> 40:46.158
Take care.

40:46.193 --> 40:48.928
Hey.

40:48.962 --> 40:51.764
If you wanna ride home
with him, you can.

40:51.798 --> 40:53.399
It's all right.

40:53.433 --> 40:56.202
Coach, this is my team.

40:56.236 --> 40:59.238
I ride with the team.

41:02.142 --> 41:04.977
Mm.

41:05.011 --> 41:06.545
All right, is that it?

41:06.580 --> 41:08.614
- Got everyone?
- We're good, coach.

41:08.648 --> 41:09.882
Damn, who's that?

41:13.653 --> 41:15.154
Whoa, wait!

41:15.188 --> 41:16.589
Wait!

41:16.623 --> 41:18.691
Wait, coach!

41:18.725 --> 41:22.661
Coach!

41:22.696 --> 41:24.697
Wanna join us?

41:24.731 --> 41:27.333
Buddy Jr.!

41:31.671 --> 41:33.539
How 'bout that second coming?

41:33.573 --> 41:35.173
♪ ♪

42:16.416 --> 42:18.183
Hey, coach.

42:18.218 --> 42:21.687
Are we there yet?

42:21.721 --> 42:23.722
Nope.

42:25.759 --> 42:29.895
But we're getting there.

42:29.929 --> 42:32.998
Slowly but surely,
we're getting there.
