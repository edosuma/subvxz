01:14.324 --> 01:17.353
Hunger strike?
How long has this been going on?

01:17.453 --> 01:19.147
She hasn't had a thing
yesterday or today.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.265
- Send her meals up regularly?
- Yes, sir.

01:21.365 --> 01:26.153
- Why don't you jam it down her throat?
- It's not as simple as that, Mr. Andrews.

01:26.253 --> 01:29.740
I'll talk to her myself.
Have some food brought up to her.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.575
Yes, sir.

01:31.675 --> 01:34.995
I'm not going to eat until
you let me off this boat!

01:35.095 --> 01:37.748
Come, now, Ellie.
You know I'll have my way.

01:37.848 --> 01:41.251
Not this time, you won't.
I'm already married to him.

01:41.351 --> 01:44.421
You're never going live under
the same roof. I'll see to that.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.325
Can't you get it through your head
King Westley and I are married?

01:47.425 --> 01:49.885
Definitely, legally,
actually married.

01:49.985 --> 01:54.014
It's over. There's not a thing you
can do. I'm over 21. So is he.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.067
Would it interest you to know
while you've been on board...

01:56.167 --> 01:58.628
I've been making arrangements
to have your marriage annulled?

01:58.728 --> 02:02.481
"Annulled!" I'll have something to
say about that, and so will King.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.173
I expect him to.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.070
The vittles. Come in, come in.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.489
I told you not to bring any food in.

02:10.589 --> 02:14.250
Wait a minute. This isn't for you.
Put it right down here.

02:22.642 --> 02:25.421
Smart, aren't you? So subtle.

02:25.521 --> 02:26.839
Strategy, my dear.

02:26.939 --> 02:31.051
I suppose it was strategy sending gorillas
to drag me from that justice of the peace.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.220
Your idea of strategy is a lead pipe.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.264
I've won a lot of arguments
with a lead pipe.

02:35.364 --> 02:39.226
Outside the fact you don't like him,
you haven't got a thing against King.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.312
- He's a fake.
- He's one of the best fliers in the country.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.982
You married him only
because I told you not to.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.293
You've been telling me what not
to do since I can remember.

02:47.393 --> 02:49.222
Because you've always
been a stubborn idiot.

02:49.323 --> 02:51.580
I come from a long line
of stubborn idiots!

02:51.680 --> 02:54.616
Don't shout so. You may
work up an appetite.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.661
I'll shout if I want to!
I'll scream if I want to!

02:57.761 --> 03:00.122
- All right, scream.
- If you don't let me off...

03:00.222 --> 03:02.624
I'll break every piece of
furniture in this room!

03:02.724 --> 03:05.753
Here, now. Have a nice
piece of juicy steak.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.172
You don't have to eat it.
Just smell it.

03:08.272 --> 03:10.139
It's a poem.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.431
Oh!

03:17.531 --> 03:19.815
Ellie! Ellie!

03:21.285 --> 03:23.187
Ellie!

03:23.287 --> 03:24.987
Ellen!

03:25.998 --> 03:27.858
- Lower the boats!
- Lower the boats!

03:27.958 --> 03:29.777
Catch her! Catch her!

03:29.877 --> 03:32.119
Come on, men. Come on!

03:36.675 --> 03:39.536
- She got away.
- Of course. She's too smart for you.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.539
Send a wireless to the
Lovington Detective Agency.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.875
"Daughter escaped again.
Watch all roads...

03:44.975 --> 03:47.211
airports, and railway
stations in Miami."

03:47.311 --> 03:49.087
All aboard!

03:49.187 --> 03:52.716
Palm Beach, Savannah, Jacksonville...

03:52.816 --> 03:54.968
New York, Philadelphia...

03:55.068 --> 03:57.971
We're wasting our time.
You imagine Ellie Andrews riding a bus?

03:58.071 --> 04:00.140
I told the old man it was bunk.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.024
Ticket for New York, please.

04:06.330 --> 04:09.281
- Here's your ticket.
- Thank you very much.

04:10.918 --> 04:14.120
- Here.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.160
What's going on?
I'd like to use that phone.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.372
Go away. This is
history in the making.

04:23.472 --> 04:26.458
- What?
- There's a man biting a dog in there.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.919
Attaboy, Petey, old boy!

04:29.019 --> 04:31.338
I can't stand this any longer.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.591
- In a pig's eye, you will!
- That's telling him!

04:34.691 --> 04:37.052
Listen, monkey face,
when you fired me...

04:37.152 --> 04:40.823
you fired the best newshound your
filthy scandal sheet ever had.

04:41.323 --> 04:44.601
You wouldn't know a newspaper
story if it kicked you in the pants.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.395
Yeah, I got all your copy.

04:46.495 --> 04:49.857
Why didn't you tell me you were
going to write it in Greek?

04:49.957 --> 04:52.526
That was free verse,
you gashouse palooka.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.529
What was free about it?
It cost this paper dough...

04:55.629 --> 04:57.823
and it's not gonna cost us any more.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.325
Mr. Gordon, he reversed
the charge on that call.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.953
What? Why, you...

05:03.053 --> 05:05.747
Say, listen, you. When you
get back to New York...

05:05.847 --> 05:07.875
keep far away from this office.

05:07.975 --> 05:12.052
You're fired. You don't work here
anymore, and you never will.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.431
What did he say?

05:17.067 --> 05:20.477
Oh, so you're changing your tune?

05:22.406 --> 05:23.974
You're late with your apologies.

05:24.074 --> 05:28.020
I wouldn't go back to work for you
if you begged on hands and knees!

05:28.120 --> 05:30.564
I hope this will be a lesson to you!

05:30.664 --> 05:32.482
That's telling him, isn't it?

05:32.582 --> 05:34.109
Did we tell that baby?

05:34.209 --> 05:37.279
- Won't give me any more of his lip.
- You tell him!

05:37.379 --> 05:40.282
I guess he knows now
how I feel about his job.

05:40.382 --> 05:43.160
- I'll bet he does too.
- Is my chariot ready?

05:43.260 --> 05:46.914
Your chariot awaiteth
"withouteth," O mighty king.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.625
Lead on, sire.

05:49.725 --> 05:52.878
- Make way for the king.
- Make way for the king.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.631
Long live the king.

05:55.731 --> 05:58.050
Make way for the king.

06:01.778 --> 06:05.057
Philadelphia. New York. All aboard!

06:05.157 --> 06:07.851
- Attaboy.
- Look out for the king's baggage.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.646
Your good-bye chariot.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.699
Scram!

06:18.128 --> 06:20.906
Make yourself comfortable
with a pleasant pillow.

06:21.006 --> 06:24.284
Pillow, sir? Two bits.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.453
A thousand miles is a long trip.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.004
Make yourself comfortable
with a pleasant pillow.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.125
Hey, driver!

06:32.225 --> 06:35.511
If you'll move those newspapers,
I'll have a seat.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.981
Hey, wait a minute!

06:49.785 --> 06:51.728
- What do you think you're doing?
- Huh?

06:51.828 --> 06:54.147
The papers... what's the
idea of throwing them out?

06:54.247 --> 06:57.818
Oh, the papers?
That's a long story, my friend.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.278
I never did like
sitting on newspapers.

07:00.378 --> 07:04.449
I did it once, and the headlines
came off on my white pants.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.661
It actually happened.
Nobody bought a paper that day.

07:07.761 --> 07:11.873
They just followed me around town and
read the news off the seat of my pants.

07:11.973 --> 07:16.218
Oh, fresh guy? What you
need's a good sock on the nose.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.090
Listen, partner...

07:20.190 --> 07:22.551
you may not like my nose, but I do.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.678
I always wear it out in the open...

07:24.778 --> 07:27.563
where if anybody wants
to sock it, they can.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.649
Oh, yeah?

07:31.701 --> 07:34.604
That's a brilliant answer.
Why didn't I think of it?

07:34.704 --> 07:37.107
Our conversation could
have been over long ago.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.650
Oh, yeah?

07:38.750 --> 07:41.570
If you keep that up,
we're not going to get anywhere.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.787
Oh, yeah?

07:44.714 --> 07:46.867
You got me. Yeah!

07:56.059 --> 07:57.753
Excuse me, lady...

07:57.853 --> 08:00.054
but that upon which you sit is mine.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.383
- I beg your pardon?
- Now, listen.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.969
I put up a stiff fight
for that seat...

08:06.069 --> 08:08.687
so if it's just the
same to you, scram.

08:09.739 --> 08:12.100
Driver, are these seats reserved?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.478
No. First come, first served.

08:14.578 --> 08:17.064
- Thank you.
- Hey, driver.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.191
These seats accommodate
two, don't they?

08:19.291 --> 08:21.193
Maybe they do and maybe they don't.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.993
Thank you.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.908
Move over.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.417
This is a "maybe they do."

08:37.601 --> 08:41.804
If you'd ask me real nice, I might
put that bag up there for you.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.408
Next time you drop in,
bring your folks.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.898
Red-hot coffee, folks. Yes, sir.

09:23.998 --> 09:27.217
Come on inside and enjoy
yourselves. Hot dogs, folks.

09:27.317 --> 09:30.387
You can't enjoy the ride unless
you put something in your stomach.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.556
Rest station. Fifteen minutes.

09:32.656 --> 09:35.692
- We'll only be here 15 minutes.
- Red-hot coffee.

09:36.492 --> 09:40.981
Right around there, boss. Yes, sir!
Red-hot coffee. Hot dogs.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.442
You can't enjoy the ride unless
you put something in your stomach.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.977
He got away.

10:27.078 --> 10:30.280
I suddenly found myself in the
brush and not a sign of the skunk.

10:30.380 --> 10:34.534
I don't know what you're raving about, young
man, and furthermore, I'm not interested.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.703
Well, of all the...

10:36.803 --> 10:40.332
Maybe you'll be interested
to know your bag's gone.

10:40.432 --> 10:44.294
- Oh, my heavens, it's gone!
- I knew you'd catch on eventually.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.130
Oh! What am I going to do now!

10:47.230 --> 10:49.299
Don't tell me your ticket was in it.

10:49.399 --> 10:53.970
No, I've got that, but not my money.
All I have is four dollars.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.973
You can wire home for more
when you get to Jacksonville.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.851
No, I can't... Yes, I guess I will.

10:59.951 --> 11:03.605
- I'll tell the driver about your bag.
- No! Thank you. I'd rather you didn't.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.691
Don't be a fool.
The company ought to make good.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.236
- What's your name?
- I don't want it reported.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.571
That's ridiculous.
The company will take care...

11:11.671 --> 11:13.740
Can you understand English?

11:13.840 --> 11:16.159
Would you please keep
out of my affairs?

11:16.259 --> 11:18.669
I want to be left alone.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.501
Why, you ungrateful brat.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.253
Board!

11:26.353 --> 11:28.178
All aboard!

11:30.482 --> 11:32.474
Board!

11:38.406 --> 11:40.649
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

13:09.581 --> 13:12.609
Jacksonville. Thirty minutes
for breakfast, folks.

13:12.709 --> 13:16.029
- Only 30 minutes for breakfast.
- Read all about it!

13:16.129 --> 13:18.990
Just 30 minutes. That's all. No more.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.785
Thirty minutes for breakfast,
folks. That's all.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.162
Read all about it!

13:24.262 --> 13:26.755
Just 30 minutes
for breakfast. That's all.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.517
Oh.

13:45.617 --> 13:48.485
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.905
Silly, isn't it?

13:52.749 --> 13:55.492
Why, everybody's gone!

13:57.170 --> 14:00.622
Oh. Thank you very much.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.119
We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?

14:04.219 --> 14:06.002
Yes.

14:07.555 --> 14:10.125
That was foolish of me.

14:10.225 --> 14:13.503
W-Well, why didn't you shove me away?

14:13.603 --> 14:15.630
I hated to wake you up.

14:15.730 --> 14:18.508
You look kind of pretty asleep.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.510
How about some breakfast?

14:20.610 --> 14:22.720
Oh, no, no. No, thank you.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.557
No, I'm going to the Windsor Hotel.

14:25.657 --> 14:29.352
Windsor? You'll never make it in time.
We leave in half an hour.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.862
Oh, no. They'll wait for me.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.235
Driver, I'm going to
be a few minutes late.

14:37.335 --> 14:40.321
- Be sure to wait for me.
- Oh, yeah?

14:40.421 --> 14:42.706
Yes.

15:03.778 --> 15:07.348
- Where's the bus to New York?
- It left about 20 minutes ago.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.309
But that's ridiculous.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.061
I was on that bus.
I told them to wait.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.230
I'm sorry, miss, but it's gone.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.149
Good morning.

15:16.249 --> 15:20.202
Remember me? I'm the fellow
you slept on last night.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.781
Seems to me I've already
thanked you for that.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.701
- What time is the next bus?
- 8:00 tonight.

15:26.801 --> 15:29.746
Eight o'clo... That's 12 hours!

15:29.846 --> 15:31.880
I'm sorry, miss.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.502
What's the matter?
Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?

15:35.602 --> 15:38.087
What are you excited about?
You missed it too.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.055
Yeah, I missed it too.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.892
Don't tell me you did
it on my account.

15:44.861 --> 15:48.355
I hope you haven't any idea that
what happened last night...

15:49.198 --> 15:51.851
Look here, young man, you needn't
concern yourself about me.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.522
- I can take care of myself.
- You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.732
Here's your ticket.

15:57.832 --> 16:00.158
- My ticket?
- I found it on the seat.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.616
Thank you.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.543
It must have fallen out of my purse.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.421
You'll never get away
with it, Miss Andrews.

16:14.349 --> 16:16.042
What are you talking about?

16:16.142 --> 16:20.345
Your father will stop you before
you get halfway to New York.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.133
You must have me confused
with someone else.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.601
Quit kidding. It's all
over the front page.

16:32.784 --> 16:36.062
I've always been curious to know
what kind of girl would marry...

16:36.162 --> 16:38.398
a front-page aviator
like King Westley.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.025
Take my advice: Grab the
next bus back to Miami.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.285
That guy's a phony.

16:44.587 --> 16:47.490
I didn't ask for your advice.

16:47.590 --> 16:50.451
That's right. You didn't.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.329
You're not going to notify
my father, are you?

16:53.429 --> 16:55.206
What for?

16:55.306 --> 16:57.650
You probably could get
some money out of him.

16:57.751 --> 16:59.127
I never thought of that.

16:59.227 --> 17:02.755
If you promise not to,
I'll pay you as much as he will.

17:02.855 --> 17:07.343
You won't gain anything by giving me away
as long as I make it worth your while.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.749
I've got to get to New York
without being stopped.

17:09.849 --> 17:14.142
It's terribly important to me. I'd pay
you now, only the only thing I had...

17:14.242 --> 17:18.313
when I jumped off was a wristwatch,
and I had to pawn that to get clothes.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.392
I'll give you my address.
Get in touch with me

17:20.492 --> 17:23.252
- the minute you get to New York.
- Never mind.

17:23.353 --> 17:26.320
I had you pegged right
from the jump...

17:26.421 --> 17:28.531
just a spoiled brat of a rich father.

17:28.631 --> 17:31.200
The only way you get
anything is to buy it.

17:31.300 --> 17:35.580
You're in a jam, and all you can think of
is your money. It never fails, does it?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.624
Ever hear of the word "humility"?

17:37.724 --> 17:41.127
No, you wouldn't. I guess it never
occurred to you to just say...

17:41.227 --> 17:43.963
"Please, mister, I'm in trouble.
Will you help me?"

17:44.063 --> 17:46.382
No. That'd bring you down
off your high horse.

17:46.482 --> 17:51.012
Let me tell you something:
You don't have to worry about me.

17:51.112 --> 17:53.556
I'm not interested in your
money or your problem.

17:53.656 --> 17:57.651
You, King Westley, your father...
you're all a lot of hooey to me.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.068
Do you send telegrams here?

18:05.168 --> 18:08.161
I'm just fine, thanks.
And how are you?

18:12.341 --> 18:15.662
"To Joe Gordon, in care of
New York Mail, New York.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.205
"Am I laughing.

18:17.305 --> 18:20.166
The biggest scoop of the
year just dropped in my lap.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.293
I know where Ellen Andrews is."

18:22.393 --> 18:24.462
No! Do you really?

18:24.562 --> 18:26.756
Go on, go on. Send the telegram.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.926
"How would you like to have
the story, you big tub of..."

18:30.026 --> 18:31.678
"of..."

18:31.778 --> 18:33.888
- "Mush."
- "Tub of mush.

18:33.988 --> 18:36.265
Well, try and get it.
What I said about...

18:36.365 --> 18:39.018
never writing another
line for you still goes.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.354
Are you burning? Peter Warne."

18:41.454 --> 18:43.398
That'll be $2.60.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.441
- Send it collect.
- "Collect"?

18:45.541 --> 18:47.325
Collect.

18:49.796 --> 18:53.282
Bus leaving for Savannah,
Charleston, Columbia...

18:53.382 --> 18:56.994
Greensborough, Richmond,
Washington, Baltimore...

18:57.094 --> 18:59.372
Philadelphia, New York.

18:59.472 --> 19:03.501
Savannah, Charleston, Columbia...

19:03.601 --> 19:05.962
Greensborough, Richmond...

19:06.062 --> 19:08.256
Washington, Baltimore...

19:13.194 --> 19:15.270
All aboard!

19:26.457 --> 19:28.735
Hi, sister. All alone?

19:28.835 --> 19:30.945
My name's Shapeley.
Might as well get acquainted.

19:31.045 --> 19:34.490
It's gonna be a long trip. Gets tiresome,
especially for somebody like you.

19:34.590 --> 19:38.703
You look like you've got class.
Yes, sir, with a capital K.

19:38.803 --> 19:42.665
And I'm the guy that knows class
when he sees it, believe you me.

19:42.765 --> 19:46.294
Ask the boys. They'll tell you:
"Shapeley knows how to pick 'em."

19:46.394 --> 19:50.173
Yes, sir. Shapeley's the name,
and that's the way I like 'em.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.341
You made no mistake
sitting next to me.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.720
The mugs on a hop like this ain't
nothin' to write home about.

19:55.820 --> 19:58.556
You gotta be awful careful
who you hit it up with.

19:58.656 --> 20:01.142
You can't be too particular neither.

20:01.242 --> 20:03.770
What's the matter, sister?
You ain't sayin' much.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.964
Seems to me you're doing excellently
without any assistance.

20:08.064 --> 20:09.358
That's pretty good.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.570
"Seems to me you're doing excellently
without any assistance."

20:13.270 --> 20:16.331
Well, shut my big nasty mouth!

20:17.300 --> 20:19.243
Looks like you're one up on me.

20:19.343 --> 20:22.497
There's nothing I like better
than to meet a high-class mama...

20:22.597 --> 20:24.582
that can snap 'em back at ya.

20:24.682 --> 20:28.211
The colder they are, the hotter
they get. That's what I always say.

20:28.311 --> 20:32.006
Yes, sir. When a cold
mama gets hot...

20:32.106 --> 20:34.050
boy, how she sizzles!

20:36.277 --> 20:38.471
You're just my type.

20:38.571 --> 20:42.016
Believe me, sister, I could
go for you in a big way.

20:42.116 --> 20:44.101
"Fun-on-the-side
Shapeley," they call me...

20:44.201 --> 20:47.480
with accent on the "fun,"
believe you me.

20:47.580 --> 20:51.241
Believe you me,
you bore me to distraction.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.822
Looks like you're two up on me now.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.282
- Hey, you.
- Huh?

20:58.382 --> 21:01.869
- There's a seat over there for you.
- What's the idea?

21:01.969 --> 21:05.456
I'd like to sit next to my
wife, if you don't mind.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.917
- Your wife?
- Yeah.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.752
Come on, come on.

21:09.852 --> 21:12.129
Oh, yeah, sure. Excuse me.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.382
I was just... Excuse me, miss.

21:14.482 --> 21:17.844
I just was trying to make
things pleasant, you see?

21:17.944 --> 21:21.013
Excuse me. I... I didn't
mean anything, doc.

21:21.113 --> 21:24.684
- N-no offense, doc.
- No.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.651
No.

21:31.165 --> 21:34.944
If you promise not to snap my
head off, I'd like to thank you.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.238
Forget it. I didn't do it for you.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.581
His voice gets on my nerves.

21:45.763 --> 21:48.416
What'd you do all day?

21:48.516 --> 21:52.594
Ran in and out of doorways
trying to keep out of the rain.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.848
Your clothes are all wet.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.012
Here.

22:01.112 --> 22:04.515
- You're as helpless as a baby.
- Thank you.

22:04.615 --> 22:07.184
Here you are, folks:
cigars, cigarettes...

22:07.284 --> 22:09.645
chewing gum, candy, magazines.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.571
Here, boy.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.526
- Yes, ma'am?
- A box of chocolates, please.

22:15.626 --> 22:17.486
Never mind. She doesn't want it.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.530
- But the lady...
- Of course I do!

22:19.630 --> 22:21.490
Beat it!

22:21.590 --> 22:24.667
You've got your nerve! Here, boy.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.831
Dollar and 60 cents.

22:28.931 --> 22:31.125
You had four dollars last night.

22:31.225 --> 22:34.879
How do you expect to get to New
York at the rate you're going?

22:34.979 --> 22:36.797
That is none of your business.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.258
You're on a budget from now on.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.560
- Just a minute. You can't...
- Shut up.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.286
- What's the matter, Officer?
- Bridge washout.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.455
Looks like we can't get
through till morning.

23:09.555 --> 23:12.083
If any of you passengers
want a place to sleep...

23:12.183 --> 23:14.752
you'll find an auto camp
up yonder a piece.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.213
- Where?
- Right over there. See those lights?

23:17.313 --> 23:19.465
- Oh, yeah.
- Dyke's Auto Camp.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.759
All right, thanks. Hey, brat.

23:21.859 --> 23:24.095
Are you talking to me?

23:24.195 --> 23:27.355
Yeah. Come on.
We're stopping here for the night.

23:42.296 --> 23:46.291
- Thank you.
- Hey, come on! We're all set!

23:56.352 --> 23:57.920
Good evening.

23:58.020 --> 24:00.638
Hope you and your husband
rest comfortable.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.474
Come on, come on.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.650
You going to stay there all night?

24:33.722 --> 24:35.833
Darn clever, these Armenians.

24:35.933 --> 24:38.134
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift.

24:39.562 --> 24:43.049
I just had the unpleasant sensation
of hearing you referred to...

24:43.149 --> 24:45.342
as my husband.

24:45.442 --> 24:49.305
Oh, yeah. I forgot to tell you:
I registered as "Mr. and Mrs."

24:49.405 --> 24:51.481
Oh, you did?

24:52.408 --> 24:55.644
What am I expected to do?
Leap for joy?

24:55.744 --> 24:58.279
I kind of half expected
you to thank me.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.068
Your ego is absolutely colossal.

25:02.168 --> 25:05.203
Yeah, yeah. Not bad. How's yours?

25:11.760 --> 25:13.829
You know, compared to you...

25:13.929 --> 25:16.297
my friend Shapeley is an amateur.

25:17.308 --> 25:21.003
Just whatever gave you any
idea I'd stand for this?

25:21.103 --> 25:22.838
Now, wait a minute.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.007
Let's get this straightened
out right now.

25:25.107 --> 25:28.928
If you're nursing any silly notion
that I'm interested in you, forget it.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.347
You're just a headline to me.

25:31.447 --> 25:33.766
A headline?

25:33.866 --> 25:36.352
You're not a newspaperman, are you?

25:36.452 --> 25:39.271
Chalk up one for your side.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.900
Now, listen. You want to get
to King Westley, don't you?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.944
All right. I'm here to help you.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.029
What I want is your story.

25:47.129 --> 25:49.949
Exclusive. A day-to-day account.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.493
All about your mad
flight to happiness.

25:52.593 --> 25:56.254
I need that story. Between you
and me, I've got to have it.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.343
Isn't that just too cute?

26:03.312 --> 26:07.007
There's a brain behind that
face of yours, isn't there?

26:07.107 --> 26:10.094
You've got everything nicely
figured out for yourself...

26:10.194 --> 26:12.054
including this.

26:12.154 --> 26:15.057
This? That's a matter
of simple mathematics.

26:15.157 --> 26:17.268
These cabins cost
two bucks a night...

26:17.368 --> 26:19.895
and I'm very sorry to
inform you, wifey dear...

26:19.995 --> 26:22.864
that the family purse won't stand
for separate establishments.

26:29.046 --> 26:31.115
Well, thank you.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.909
Thank you very much.
You've been very kind.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.579
It's all right with me.
Go out in the storm.

26:36.679 --> 26:38.747
But I'm going to follow you, see?

26:38.847 --> 26:41.667
Yeah. And if you get tough...

26:41.767 --> 26:45.379
I'll just have to turn you over
to your old man... right now.

26:45.479 --> 26:48.681
Savvy? Now, that's my
whole plot in a nutshell.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.928
A simple story for simple people.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.806
If you behave, I'll see that
you get to King Westley.

26:55.906 --> 26:59.400
If not, I'll just have to
spill the beans to Papa.

27:00.202 --> 27:03.738
Now, which of these
beds do you prefer?

27:04.540 --> 27:07.492
This one? All right.

27:29.064 --> 27:32.551
That, I suppose,
makes everything quite all right.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.186
Oh, this?

27:37.156 --> 27:39.558
I like privacy when I retire.

27:39.658 --> 27:43.027
I'm very delicate in that respect.
Prying eyes annoy me.

27:47.708 --> 27:50.027
Behold the walls of Jericho.

27:50.127 --> 27:53.822
Maybe not as thick as the ones
Joshua blew down with his trumpet...

27:53.922 --> 27:55.658
but a lot safer.

27:55.758 --> 27:58.827
You see, I have no trumpet.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.538
Just to show you my heart's
in the right place...

28:01.638 --> 28:03.881
I'll give you my best
pair of pajamas.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.678
Do you mind joining the Israelites?

28:09.605 --> 28:12.841
You don't want to join
the Israelites? All right.

28:12.941 --> 28:16.804
Perhaps you're interested
in how a man undresses.

28:16.904 --> 28:20.057
There's a funny thing about that.
Quite a study in psychology.

28:20.157 --> 28:21.850
No two men do it alike.

28:21.950 --> 28:25.813
I knew a man who kept his hat on
until he was completely undressed.

28:25.913 --> 28:27.856
He made a picture!

28:27.956 --> 28:30.276
Years later, his secret came out.

28:30.376 --> 28:33.362
He wore a toupee. Yeah.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.489
I have a method all my own.

28:35.589 --> 28:37.700
If you'll notice,
the coat came first...

28:37.800 --> 28:40.369
then the tie, then the shirt.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.496
Now, according to Hoyle...

28:42.596 --> 28:45.040
after that, the pants should be next.

28:45.140 --> 28:48.961
There's where I'm different:
I go for the shoes next.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.754
First the right...

28:50.854 --> 28:53.215
then the left.

28:53.315 --> 28:54.883
After that...

28:54.983 --> 28:57.935
it's every man for himself.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.460
Still with me, brat?

29:25.347 --> 29:27.548
Don't be a sucker.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.502
A good night's rest will do you good.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.005
Besides, you've got
nothing to worry about.

29:33.105 --> 29:36.641
The walls of Jericho will protect
you from the big bad wolf.

29:52.082 --> 29:54.651
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf

29:54.751 --> 29:58.113
The big bad wolf
The big bad wolf

29:58.213 --> 30:00.616
She's afraid of the big bad wolf

30:00.716 --> 30:03.167
Tra, la, la, la, la

30:05.679 --> 30:08.082
Would you mind please
putting out the light?

30:08.182 --> 30:10.758
No, not at all.

30:50.307 --> 30:53.419
I wish you'd take those things
off the walls of Jericho.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.970
Oh, excuse me.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.490
By the way, what's your name?

31:23.590 --> 31:25.451
What's that?

31:25.551 --> 31:27.668
Who are you?

31:29.054 --> 31:30.963
Who, me?

31:31.974 --> 31:35.085
I'm the whippoorwill
that cries in the night.

31:35.185 --> 31:39.381
I'm the soft morning breeze
that caresses your lovely face.

31:39.481 --> 31:42.134
You've got a name, haven't you?

31:42.234 --> 31:45.804
Yeah, I got a name: Peter Warne.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.599
"Peter Warne."

31:48.699 --> 31:50.476
I don't like it.

31:50.576 --> 31:54.361
Don't let it bother you.
You're giving it back to me in the morning.

31:56.665 --> 31:58.567
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne.

31:58.667 --> 32:03.120
The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Warne.

32:21.815 --> 32:23.634
Another message, sir.

32:23.734 --> 32:26.762
- What is it?
- It's from Charleston, Mr. Andrews.

32:26.862 --> 32:30.557
"Checking every northbound train. Also
assigned 20 operators to watch highways.

32:30.657 --> 32:34.102
No sign of your daughter yet.
Will continue to do everything possible.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.063
Signed, Lovington Detective Agency."

32:36.163 --> 32:38.440
Just the same as all the others.

32:38.540 --> 32:39.154
Yes, sir?

32:39.255 --> 32:41.610
I made it clear I was in a
hurry to get to New York.

32:41.710 --> 32:44.321
- What are we crawling for?
- I've got it wide open, sir.

32:44.421 --> 32:46.031
- Step on it!
- Yes, sir.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.200
Oh, I hope she's all right, sir.

32:48.300 --> 32:52.788
"All right"? Of course she's all right.
What could happen to her?

32:52.888 --> 32:55.840
- Nothing, sir.
- Then shut up about it!

33:19.915 --> 33:21.740
Hello?

33:23.835 --> 33:25.744
Hey, mister.

33:29.091 --> 33:30.784
Oh, hello.

33:30.884 --> 33:33.161
What's the matter? You not up yet?

33:33.261 --> 33:35.289
- What time is it?
- 8:00.

33:35.389 --> 33:36.790
Here.

33:36.890 --> 33:40.419
What... Oh, it's a
toothbrush. Thanks.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.045
My dress...

33:42.145 --> 33:43.922
you had it pressed!

33:44.022 --> 33:46.174
Come on. Breakfast will be ready.

33:46.274 --> 33:48.510
You sweet thing.
Where'd you get it pressed?

33:48.610 --> 33:53.015
I'm gonna count ten. If you're not out of
that bed, I'm coming and drag you out.

33:53.115 --> 33:56.059
- One, two, three, four, five, six...
- I really think you would.

33:56.159 --> 33:58.020
- seven, eight, nine...
- I'm out, I'm out.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.272
I'm out. I'm out.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.490
You'll find the showers and things
just behind the second cottage.

34:05.085 --> 34:06.987
Outside?

34:07.087 --> 34:09.496
Certainly. All the best
homes have them outside.

34:12.134 --> 34:14.411
Really, I-I can't go out like this.

34:14.511 --> 34:16.996
- Like what?
- Like this. I have no robe.

34:17.097 --> 34:18.915
Oh. Here.

34:19.014 --> 34:20.833
- Use mine.
- Oh, thanks.

34:20.934 --> 34:22.753
Come on. Make it snappy.

34:22.853 --> 34:25.589
It's not my fault.
You got the sleeve.

34:25.688 --> 34:29.141
- Here. Here are my puppets.
- Thanks.

34:30.944 --> 34:33.554
Where'd you say the
showers and things were?

34:33.655 --> 34:35.766
Here. Here's a towel.

34:35.866 --> 34:37.858
Thank you.

34:38.952 --> 34:41.772
You're kind of little, aren't you?

34:41.871 --> 34:44.440
- Where's the shower?
- Your hair's cute like that.

34:44.541 --> 34:47.534
- You should never comb it.
- I'll find it myself.

35:20.702 --> 35:22.604
Are the showers in there?

35:22.704 --> 35:24.731
Well, they ain't out here.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.573
Thank you.

35:29.919 --> 35:32.913
Can't a body have a little
privacy around here?

35:37.493 --> 35:41.280
If you want a shower around
here, you'll stand in line.

35:51.399 --> 35:54.386
Hi, sister.
You remember me? Shapeley?

35:54.486 --> 35:57.472
I'm sorry about last night.
Didn't know you was married.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.565
You shoulda told me right off.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.486
High time you got back.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.864
I met some very interesting
women at the showers.

36:13.964 --> 36:17.325
We got chatting about this and that.
You know how time flies.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.047
Come on, sit down.

36:25.392 --> 36:27.502
My, my, my. Scrambled eggs.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.713
"Egg." One egg.

36:29.813 --> 36:33.258
One doughnut. Black coffee.
That's your ration till lunch.

36:33.358 --> 36:35.677
- Any complaints?
- No, no complaints.

36:35.777 --> 36:39.181
I'd have gotten cream, but it'd
have meant buying a whole pint.

36:39.281 --> 36:41.433
You don't have to apologize to me.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.852
You'll never know how much
I appreciate all this.

36:43.952 --> 36:46.730
What makes you so disgustingly
cheerful this morning?

36:46.830 --> 36:48.523
It must be the spring.

36:48.623 --> 36:51.735
I thought "believe you me"
told you a couple snappy stories.

36:51.835 --> 36:54.488
Oh, no. He apologized for last night.

36:54.588 --> 36:56.490
Said he didn't know we were married.

36:56.590 --> 36:59.124
Just shows you how
wrong a guy can be.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.537
Doughnut?

37:02.637 --> 37:05.123
Thanks.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.919
You think this whole business is silly,
don't you? I mean, running away.

37:09.019 --> 37:11.213
No, no. Makes too good a story.

37:11.313 --> 37:14.633
Yes, you do. You think I'm
a fool and a spoiled brat.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.552
Perhaps I am, though I
don't see how I can be.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.472
Spoiled people are accustomed
to having their way. I never have.

37:20.572 --> 37:23.058
I've always been told what to do...

37:23.158 --> 37:26.645
and how to do it and
when and with whom.

37:26.745 --> 37:30.774
Would you believe it? This is the first
time I've ever been alone with a man.

37:30.874 --> 37:33.527
- Yeah.
- It's a wonder I'm not panic-stricken.

37:33.627 --> 37:35.987
You're doing all right.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.031
Thanks.

37:38.131 --> 37:40.659
Nurses, governesses...

37:40.759 --> 37:44.866
chaperones, even bodyguards.
Oh, it's been a lot of fun.

37:44.967 --> 37:47.374
One consolation:
You can never get lonesome.

37:47.474 --> 37:50.794
It has its moments.
It's become a sort of game...

37:50.894 --> 37:53.213
trying to outwit Father's detectives.

37:53.313 --> 37:57.092
I did once. I actually went
shopping without a bodyguard.

37:57.192 --> 37:59.928
It was swell. I felt
absolutely immoral.

38:00.028 --> 38:02.973
It didn't last long. They caught
me in a department store.

38:03.073 --> 38:05.433
I was so mad, I ran out the back...

38:05.533 --> 38:07.769
and jumped into the first car I saw.

38:07.869 --> 38:11.481
- Guess who was in it.
- Santa Claus. Gandhi.

38:11.581 --> 38:13.985
King Westley was in it.

38:15.085 --> 38:17.279
Is that how you met him?

38:17.379 --> 38:20.156
We rode around all afternoon.
Father was frantic.

38:20.256 --> 38:23.417
By 6:00 he was having
all the rivers dragged.

38:25.387 --> 38:28.623
Say, where'd you learn to dunk?
In finishing school?

38:28.723 --> 38:31.167
Don't you start telling
me I shouldn't dunk.

38:31.267 --> 38:34.129
Of course you shouldn't.
You don't know how. Dunking's an art.

38:34.229 --> 38:38.133
Don't let it soak so long. A dip...
and sock! Into your mouth.

38:38.233 --> 38:42.721
Let it hang too long, it'll get soft
and fall off. All a matter of timing.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.807
- I'll write a book about it.
- Thanks, Professor.

38:45.907 --> 38:49.686
Just goes to show you: 20 millions,
and you don't know how to dunk.

38:49.786 --> 38:53.064
I'd change places with a
plumber's daughter any day.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.651
How do I know who you are?
I never saw you before.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.737
You can't go around
bothering my tenants.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.156
There's no girl by that name here.

39:01.256 --> 39:03.158
Besides, how do I know
you're detectives?

39:03.258 --> 39:05.500
Show him your credentials, Mac.

39:08.430 --> 39:10.457
- Detectives!
- Oh!

39:10.557 --> 39:13.043
That's Father at work.
Peter, what'll I do?

39:13.143 --> 39:15.962
Maybe I can jump out the window.
They won't see me.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.714
Sit down. Get yourself mussed up.

39:17.814 --> 39:21.183
Get your hair down over your
eyes and your blouse unfastened.

39:21.985 --> 39:24.971
Yeah, I got a letter from
Aunt Bella last week.

39:25.071 --> 39:28.391
If we don't stop over to Wilkes-Barre,
she'll never forgive us.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.518
What are you talking about?

39:30.618 --> 39:33.438
The baby's due next month.
They want us to come.

39:33.538 --> 39:38.158
Oh, yeah. She saw your sister
the other day. Said she's looking swell.

39:41.254 --> 39:44.532
- Come in.
- I hope Aunt Bella has a boy.

39:44.632 --> 39:48.126
Grandma says it's a girl.
She hasn't missed calling one in years.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.123
Man here to see you, sweetheart.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.459
Me? You want to see me?

39:54.559 --> 39:57.212
- What's your name?
- Are you addressin' me?

39:57.312 --> 40:00.131
- Yeah. What's your name?
- Hey, wait a minute.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.217
That's my wife you're talking to.

40:02.317 --> 40:04.886
What do you mean, coming here?
What do you want?

40:04.986 --> 40:06.221
We're looking for somebody.

40:06.321 --> 40:08.723
Look your head off,
but don't come in here.

40:08.823 --> 40:11.351
I've got a notion to
take a sock at you.

40:11.451 --> 40:13.979
- Take it easy, son.
- These men are detectives.

40:14.079 --> 40:18.108
I don't care if they're police. They can't
bust in here shooting questions at my wife.

40:18.208 --> 40:21.069
Don't get so excited.
The man asked a simple question.

40:21.169 --> 40:25.907
Oh, is that so? How many times have
I told you to stop butting in?

40:26.007 --> 40:27.378
You don't have to lose your temper.

40:27.479 --> 40:30.028
"You don't have to lose your temper."
That's what you said the other time.

40:30.128 --> 40:33.093
Every time I try to protect you!
The other night at the dance,

40:33.194 --> 40:37.127
- when that Swede made a pass...
- He didn't make a pass at me!

40:37.227 --> 40:39.736
I saw him. He kept pawing
you all over the dance floor.

40:39.837 --> 40:43.633
- He didn't. You were drunk.
- Nuts! You're just like your old man!

40:43.733 --> 40:45.885
Once a plumber's daughter,
always a plumber's daughter.

40:45.985 --> 40:48.221
Ain't an ounce of
brains in your family!

40:48.321 --> 40:51.433
- You've gone far enough!
- Shut up!

40:51.533 --> 40:53.560
See what you've done?

40:53.660 --> 40:56.980
Sorry, Mr. Warne, but we've
got to check up on everybody.

40:57.080 --> 41:01.609
We're looking for Ellen Andrews,
the daughter of that Wall Street mug.

41:01.709 --> 41:04.154
Too bad you ain't looking
for a plumber's daughter.

41:04.254 --> 41:06.489
Quit bawling! Quit bawling!

41:06.589 --> 41:10.417
I told you they were a
perfectly nice married couple.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.467
You weren't bad,
jumping in like that.

41:25.567 --> 41:28.470
- You've got a brain, haven't you?
- You're not so bad yourself.

41:28.570 --> 41:30.472
We could start a
two-people stock company.

41:30.572 --> 41:32.974
If things get tough, we'll play
the small-town auditoriums.

41:33.074 --> 41:35.477
We'll call this one
The Great Deception.

41:35.577 --> 41:37.896
What about Cinderella or
A Real Hot Love Story?

41:37.996 --> 41:40.231
- No, too mushy.
- I like mushy stuff.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.569
Quit bawling! You're just like...

41:44.669 --> 41:46.071
- Five minutes.
- What?

41:46.171 --> 41:47.739
Your bus leaves in five minutes.

41:47.839 --> 41:51.708
Oh! Holy smoke!
We're not even packed yet.

41:55.680 --> 41:59.751
I'm beginning to believe you fellas
couldn't find your way home.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.711
- Yeah?
- Telegram for you.

42:01.811 --> 42:04.339
- Bring it in.
- Another wire from Peter Warne.

42:04.439 --> 42:06.466
Warne? Throw it in the wastebasket.

42:06.566 --> 42:09.351
Wait a minute. What does it say?

42:10.278 --> 42:12.138
"Have I got a story. Stop.

42:12.238 --> 42:15.100
It's getting hotter and hotter.
Stop. Hope you're the same."

42:17.285 --> 42:19.020
- Collect?
- Yes.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.147
If you accept another one,
you're fired.

42:21.247 --> 42:24.526
- Yes sir.
- That gives me a good idea for all of you!

42:24.626 --> 42:26.402
I want action, Lovington!

42:26.502 --> 42:29.614
- We can't do the impossible.
- What I'm asking isn't impossible.

42:29.714 --> 42:32.575
My daughter is between here
and Miami. I want her found.

42:32.675 --> 42:35.703
- I put extra men on all along the way.
- That's not enough.

42:35.803 --> 42:38.873
Send in Clark and Brown.
You're sure she isn't with King Westley?

42:38.973 --> 42:42.043
No. He's been trailed 24 hours
a day since this thing started.

42:42.143 --> 42:44.940
He can't even get a phone
call we don't know about.

42:45.041 --> 42:49.050
I'm worried, Lovington.
Something might have happened to her.

42:49.150 --> 42:51.845
Brown, make arrangements
for a radio broadcast.

42:51.945 --> 42:54.970
Coast-to-coast hookup. Offer a
reward of $10,000 for information

42:55.071 --> 42:56.905
- leading to her whereabouts.
- Yes, sir.

42:57.006 --> 42:59.227
Clark, send the story
to all the newspapers.

42:59.327 --> 43:01.938
Some out-of-town papers may
not have a picture of her.

43:02.038 --> 43:03.898
Here. Wire this to them.

43:03.998 --> 43:06.651
- I want the story to break right away.
- Yes, sir.

43:06.751 --> 43:08.736
Now we'll get some action!

43:45.164 --> 43:47.317
That's fine. Say, fellas...

43:47.417 --> 43:50.862
do you know that one about the
man who flew on the trapeze?

43:50.962 --> 43:52.822
- Sure.
- Oh, yeah.

43:52.922 --> 43:55.457
- "Flying Trapeze."
- Attaboy.

43:58.011 --> 43:59.954
Once I was happy

44:00.054 --> 44:02.123
But now I'm forlorn

44:02.223 --> 44:05.668
Like an old coat that
is tattered and torn

44:05.768 --> 44:10.048
Left in this wide world
to weep and to mourn

44:10.148 --> 44:14.219
Betrayed by a maid in her teens

44:14.319 --> 44:17.437
Oh, this maid that I loved
she was handsome

44:18.364 --> 44:22.352
And I tried all I knew how to please

44:22.452 --> 44:26.022
But I never could please her
one quarter so well

44:26.122 --> 44:29.943
As the man on the flying trapeze

44:30.043 --> 44:34.155
He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

44:34.255 --> 44:37.659
The daring young man
on the flying trapeze

44:37.759 --> 44:41.663
His actions are graceful
All girls he does please

44:41.763 --> 44:45.583
And my love he purloined away

44:52.273 --> 44:55.051
Hey, I know the second verse there.

44:55.151 --> 44:56.427
Yeah.

44:56.527 --> 45:00.598
Now, he'd play with a miss
like a cat with a mouse

45:00.698 --> 45:04.352
His eyes would undress
every girl in the house

45:04.452 --> 45:08.231
Perhaps he is better
described as a louse

45:08.331 --> 45:11.484
And still people came just the same

45:11.584 --> 45:16.197
Now, he smiles from the
bar on the people below

45:16.297 --> 45:19.332
And one night he smiled on my love

45:20.134 --> 45:24.038
She blew him a kiss and
she hollered "Bravo!"

45:24.138 --> 45:27.125
As he hung by his
schnozzle from above

45:27.225 --> 45:29.711
Oh, he floats through the air

45:29.811 --> 45:31.879
With the greatest of ease

45:31.979 --> 45:35.550
The daring young man
on the flying trapeze

45:35.650 --> 45:39.512
His actions are graceful
The girls he does please

45:39.612 --> 45:43.690
My love he has stolen away

45:45.493 --> 45:48.695
Say, you mind if
I take the third one?

45:53.751 --> 45:57.572
I wept and I whimpered
I simpered for weeks

45:57.672 --> 46:01.576
While she spent her time
with the circus's freaks

46:01.676 --> 46:05.455
The tears were like hailstones
that rolled down my cheeks

46:05.555 --> 46:08.082
Alas, alack, and Alaska

46:08.182 --> 46:12.587
I went to this fellow,
the villain and I said

46:12.687 --> 46:16.174
I'll see that you get your deserts

46:16.274 --> 46:20.136
His thumb to his nose
he put up with a sneer

46:20.236 --> 46:23.765
- He sneered once again and said...
- Whoa!

46:23.865 --> 46:27.769
He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

46:27.869 --> 46:31.272
The daring young man
on the flying trapeze

46:31.372 --> 46:34.567
His actions are graceful
All the girls he does please

46:34.667 --> 46:39.371
And my love he has stolen away

46:46.471 --> 46:49.832
- Everybody keep your seats.
- Thank the man for me, Peter.

46:49.932 --> 46:53.169
It's the first comfortable
position I've been in all night.

46:53.269 --> 46:57.131
Oh, she flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

46:57.231 --> 46:59.467
Ma! Ma!

46:59.567 --> 47:01.761
Ma! What's the matter with you?

47:01.861 --> 47:04.347
Somebody help us!
Something's happened to her!

47:04.447 --> 47:07.975
Get some water, somebody.
Let me in there, son.

47:08.075 --> 47:10.895
You got some smelling salts?

47:10.995 --> 47:12.779
Ma!

47:14.040 --> 47:17.443
Come on. Let's give your mother
a chance to snap out of it.

47:17.543 --> 47:21.489
Don't worry. She'll be all
right in a few minutes.

47:21.589 --> 47:25.076
We ain't ate nothing since yesterday.

47:25.176 --> 47:28.162
Oh? What happened to your money?

47:28.262 --> 47:30.373
Ma spent it all on the tickets.

47:30.473 --> 47:33.626
We didn't know it was
gonna be so much.

47:33.726 --> 47:36.304
We shouldn't have come, I guess.

47:36.604 --> 47:40.258
But Ma said there was a job
waiting for her in New York...

47:40.358 --> 47:44.060
and if we didn't go,
she might lose it.

47:48.241 --> 47:50.768
She'll be all right when
she's had something to eat.

47:50.868 --> 47:55.189
Here, honey. The next town we
come to, buy some food. Come on.

47:55.289 --> 47:58.818
I shouldn't oughta take this.
Ma'll get mad.

47:58.918 --> 48:02.363
Don't tell her. You don't want
her to get sick again, do you?

48:02.463 --> 48:04.782
- No, but you might need it.
- Come on.

48:04.882 --> 48:07.452
- I got millions.
- Gee, thanks.

48:07.552 --> 48:09.836
Come on. Let's go
back to your mother.

48:27.321 --> 48:29.682
- Better phone for help.
- You can if you want.

48:29.782 --> 48:31.851
The nearest town is
10 miles from here.

48:31.951 --> 48:34.187
- Yeah?
- Say, buddy...

48:34.287 --> 48:37.363
like to take a look at my paper?

48:38.165 --> 48:41.736
Traveling like this, you lose track
of what's going on in the world.

48:41.836 --> 48:45.072
Take that story there, for instance.

48:45.172 --> 48:48.493
If I was to see that dame,
you know what I'd do?

48:48.593 --> 48:49.492
No, what?

48:49.593 --> 48:52.877
- I'd go 50-50 with you.
- Why?

48:52.978 --> 48:54.832
Because I don't believe
in hogging it, see?

48:54.932 --> 48:58.461
A bird that figures that way always
ends up behind the eight ball.

48:58.561 --> 49:01.095
That's what I always say.

49:03.065 --> 49:07.602
- What's on your mind?
- Five Gs or I crab the works.

49:13.701 --> 49:16.437
Let's get away from this gang,
talk this over privately.

49:16.537 --> 49:19.113
I knew she wasn't
your wife all the time.

49:21.709 --> 49:26.280
You know, lucky thing, my running
into you. Just the man I need.

49:26.380 --> 49:29.617
- You made no mistake.
- I can use a smart guy like you.

49:29.717 --> 49:31.953
When you're talking to
Shapeley, you're talking to...

49:32.053 --> 49:33.871
You pack a gat?

49:33.971 --> 49:36.499
- Huh?
- A gat, a gat.

49:36.599 --> 49:38.834
A rod. Got any fireworks on you?

49:38.934 --> 49:40.711
Why, no.

49:40.811 --> 49:43.339
It's all right. I got machine
guns in my suitcase.

49:43.439 --> 49:46.259
I'll let you have one.
We may have trouble up north...

49:46.359 --> 49:49.242
have to shoot it out with the cops.
But if you come through,

49:49.343 --> 49:52.668
those five Gs are in the bag...
maybe more. I'll talk with the Killer,

49:52.769 --> 49:55.176
- see he takes care of you.
- "Killer"?

49:55.276 --> 49:58.312
Yeah, the big boy.
The boss of the outfit.

49:58.412 --> 50:00.648
You're not kidnapping her, are you?

50:00.748 --> 50:04.485
What else, stupid? You don't think
we're after that penny-ante reward?

50:04.585 --> 50:07.655
- Ten thousand bucks?
- Chicken feed.

50:07.755 --> 50:11.325
Hey, listen. We're holding that
dame for a million smackers.

50:11.425 --> 50:15.538
I didn't know it was anything
like this. You see, I've got...

50:15.638 --> 50:17.957
What's the matter?
You getting yellow?

50:18.057 --> 50:21.043
I'm married, a couple kids.
I can't afford to...

50:21.143 --> 50:24.505
Pipe down, you mug, before I...

50:24.605 --> 50:27.675
What are you trying to do,
tell the whole world about it?

50:27.775 --> 50:30.636
Listen, you're into this thing,
and you're staying in, get me?

50:30.736 --> 50:32.346
You know too much.

50:32.446 --> 50:34.181
I-I won't say anything, honest.

50:34.281 --> 50:37.435
How do I know that?
I got a notion to plug you.

50:37.535 --> 50:39.604
Why should I take a chance with you?

50:39.704 --> 50:41.731
Trust me, mister,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

50:41.831 --> 50:43.531
Yeah?

50:44.875 --> 50:46.527
What's your name?

50:46.627 --> 50:48.404
Oscar Shapeley.

50:48.504 --> 50:51.198
- Where do you live?
- Orange, New Jersey.

50:51.298 --> 50:53.117
Got a couple of kids?

50:53.217 --> 50:56.412
Y-Yes, sir. Just babies.
A little golden-haired girl...

50:56.512 --> 50:59.165
- You love them, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

50:59.265 --> 51:01.208
Why, you wouldn't...
You're not thinking...

51:01.308 --> 51:04.086
- You keep your trap shut, all right?
- Sure, sure!

51:04.186 --> 51:06.631
- If you don't...
- I will, I will.

51:06.731 --> 51:09.175
You ever hear of Bugs Dooley?

51:09.275 --> 51:11.052
B-B-Bugs Dooley? No.

51:11.152 --> 51:15.620
A nice guy, like you, but he made a
mistake one day. Got too talkative.

51:15.721 --> 51:17.780
- Know what happened to his kid?
- No.

51:17.881 --> 51:21.270
I can't tell you, but when Bugs heard
about it, he blew his brains out.

51:21.370 --> 51:23.898
Oh, gee, that's terrible. Terrible.

51:23.998 --> 51:26.442
He had it coming, though.
He talked too much.

51:26.542 --> 51:29.487
I never talk. I never say a word.
W-Word of honor.

51:29.587 --> 51:32.365
Gee, I wouldn't want anything
to happen to my kids.

51:32.465 --> 51:35.242
Okay. Just remember that.

51:35.342 --> 51:36.911
Now beat it.

51:37.011 --> 51:39.246
Sure, mister. Thanks.

51:39.346 --> 51:41.415
I always knew you guys were...

51:41.515 --> 51:44.377
Come on, scram. And stay
away from that bus.

51:44.477 --> 51:46.837
Sure. Anything you say, mister.

51:46.937 --> 51:49.757
- Ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
- If you don't beat it...

51:49.857 --> 51:51.391
I'm going.

52:05.873 --> 52:08.693
- Come on!
- Why do we have to leave the bus?

52:08.793 --> 52:10.611
Come on. Don't ask so many questions.

52:10.711 --> 52:12.412
Why?

52:18.344 --> 52:21.747
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't
have frightened him like that.

52:21.847 --> 52:25.418
At the rate he's going, he's probably
crossed two state lines by this time.

52:25.518 --> 52:29.171
Say, why did we have
to leave the bus?

52:29.271 --> 52:33.426
When Shapeley stops running,
he's going to start thinking, isn't he?

52:33.526 --> 52:37.555
You know, I've been doing
a little thinking myself.

52:37.655 --> 52:40.725
The next town we come to,
you better wire your father.

52:40.825 --> 52:42.977
What's the matter? Are you weakening?

52:43.077 --> 52:45.521
No. No, just thinking of you.

52:45.621 --> 52:47.648
A starvation diet may
not agree with you.

52:47.748 --> 52:50.067
Did you give that
child all your money?

52:50.167 --> 52:52.778
I didn't give him anything.
You were the bighearted gal.

52:52.878 --> 52:55.114
All the money I had
was that ten-spot...

52:55.214 --> 52:58.492
so I've been thinking you
better wire your father.

52:58.592 --> 53:00.244
No, sir.

53:00.344 --> 53:02.622
I started out for New York,
and I'm going to get there...

53:02.722 --> 53:06.417
- if I have to starve all the way.
- Okay.

53:06.517 --> 53:08.627
What is this strange power...

53:08.727 --> 53:11.255
this man Westley has over you women?

53:11.355 --> 53:13.340
Here. Take these.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.760
Hold on to them. Get up on that log.

53:16.260 --> 53:18.227
Get up on the log.

53:28.289 --> 53:30.316
I wish you'd stop being playful.

53:30.416 --> 53:32.610
Oh, so sorry. Sorry.

53:32.710 --> 53:36.030
This is the first time in years
I've ridden piggyback.

53:36.130 --> 53:38.532
- This isn't piggyback.
- Of course it is.

53:38.632 --> 53:40.534
You're crazy.

53:40.634 --> 53:44.371
I remember distinctly my father
taking me for a piggyback ride.

53:44.471 --> 53:46.582
- And he carried you like this?
- Yes.

53:46.682 --> 53:49.543
Your father didn't know beans
about piggyback riding.

53:49.643 --> 53:52.296
My uncle, Mother's brother,
has four children...

53:52.396 --> 53:54.089
and I've seen them ride piggyback.

53:54.189 --> 53:57.259
I'll bet there isn't a good
piggyback rider in your family.

53:57.359 --> 54:00.763
I never knew a rich man yet
who could piggyback ride.

54:00.863 --> 54:03.349
You're prejudiced.

54:03.449 --> 54:06.477
Show me a good piggybacker,
and I'll show you a real human.

54:06.577 --> 54:09.522
Take Abraham Lincoln:
a natural born piggybacker.

54:09.622 --> 54:12.949
Where do you get off with that
stuffed-shirt family of yours?

54:14.752 --> 54:18.037
My father was a great piggybacker.

54:18.923 --> 54:21.082
Here, hold this a minute.

54:22.801 --> 54:25.670
- Oh!
- Thank you.

54:31.018 --> 54:34.637
How long does this keep up?
My feet are killing me.

54:48.077 --> 54:50.646
This looks like the best spot.

54:50.746 --> 54:53.357
We're not going to sleep
out here, are we?

54:53.457 --> 54:56.193
I'm going to give a
good imitation of it.

54:56.293 --> 54:58.612
Peter?

54:58.712 --> 55:00.447
What?

55:00.547 --> 55:02.408
I'm awfully hungry.

55:02.508 --> 55:05.870
- Oh, it's just your imagination.
- No, it isn't.

55:05.970 --> 55:08.789
I'm hungry and... and scared.

55:08.889 --> 55:11.750
You can't be hungry and
scared both at the same time.

55:11.850 --> 55:13.468
- Well, I am.
- If you're scared,

55:13.569 --> 55:18.173
- it scares the hunger out of you.
- Not if you're more hungry than scared.

55:18.273 --> 55:20.050
All right, you win.

55:20.150 --> 55:22.351
Let's forget about it.

55:23.487 --> 55:26.390
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.

55:26.490 --> 55:28.517
Holy smoke!

55:28.617 --> 55:31.478
Why did I ever get mixed up with you?

55:31.578 --> 55:34.857
If I had any sense, I'd be
in New York by this time.

55:34.957 --> 55:36.650
What about your story?

55:36.750 --> 55:39.570
Taking a married woman
back to her husband.

55:42.756 --> 55:45.458
I turned out to be the prize sucker.

55:47.136 --> 55:50.129
All right, come on.
Your bed's all ready.

55:51.015 --> 55:52.958
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.

55:53.058 --> 55:54.793
- Then take 'em off.
- What?

55:54.893 --> 55:57.463
All right, don't.
Do whatever you please...

55:57.563 --> 55:59.722
but shut up about it.

56:29.136 --> 56:32.790
You know, you're becoming
awfully disagreeable lately.

56:32.890 --> 56:36.759
You just snap my head off
every time I open my mouth.

56:38.979 --> 56:42.682
If being with me is so distasteful
to you, you can leave.

56:44.485 --> 56:47.513
You can leave anytime you see fit.

56:47.613 --> 56:49.855
Nobody's holding you here.

56:51.283 --> 56:53.526
I can get along.

56:58.916 --> 57:00.825
Peter?

57:02.836 --> 57:05.030
Peter!

57:05.130 --> 57:08.617
Oh, Peter! Peter!

57:08.717 --> 57:10.661
Peter! Peter!

57:10.761 --> 57:12.746
Peter! Oh, Peter!

57:12.846 --> 57:14.915
- What's the matter?
- I was so scared!

57:15.015 --> 57:18.752
What got into you? I went to try
and find you something to eat.

57:18.852 --> 57:20.879
- I know, but...
- Here.

57:20.979 --> 57:23.882
- Here, eat your head off.
- I don't want it now.

57:23.982 --> 57:26.760
- I thought you said you were hungry.
- I was, but...

57:26.860 --> 57:28.637
But what?

57:28.737 --> 57:30.848
I was so scared,
it scared the hung...

57:30.948 --> 57:34.191
Holy jumpin' catfish!
You'd drive a guy crazy!

58:17.369 --> 58:20.404
It's liable to get chilly before
morning. You better use this.

58:57.242 --> 58:59.110
What are you thinking about?

59:01.121 --> 59:03.607
By a strange coincidence,
I was thinking of you.

59:03.707 --> 59:05.651
Really?

59:05.751 --> 59:08.028
Yeah.

59:08.128 --> 59:11.831
I was just wondering what makes
dames like you so dizzy.

59:45.832 --> 59:48.402
What did you say we're
supposed to be doing?

59:48.502 --> 59:50.154
Hitchhiking.

59:50.254 --> 59:51.947
Oh.

59:52.047 --> 59:55.784
Well, you've given me a very
good example of the hiking.

59:55.884 --> 59:58.078
Where does the hitching come in?

59:58.178 --> 01:00:00.796
A little early yet. No cars out.

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:06.170
If it's just the same to you...

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:09.722
I'm going to sit right here
and wait till they come.

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:21.768
Ooh. You got a toothpick?

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:24.605
- What's the matter?
- Got hay in my teeth.

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:28.400
No, I haven't got a toothpick.
Here. I got a penknife, though.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.320
- Hold still.
- Be careful.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.363
- Where is it?
- Right in the middle.

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.490
The middle? All right. Hold still.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:38.035
Real still. All right. There.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:41.246
- Get it?
- Thanks.

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:44.625
You should've swallowed that.
You're not gonna have breakfast.

01:00:44.725 --> 01:00:46.967
Oh, you needn't rub it in.

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:53.467
- What are you eating?
- Carrots.

01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:55.802
- Raw?
- Want one?

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:57.804
No!

01:00:57.904 --> 01:01:00.307
Why didn't you get me
something I could eat?

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:04.811
Oh, that's right. I forgot. The idea of
offering a raw carrot to an Andrews.

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:07.856
You don't think I'm going around
panhandling for you, do you?

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:10.651
Better have one of these.
Best thing for you, carrots.

01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:12.877
I hate the horrid things.

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:18.450
I wish you wouldn't talk so much.
We let a car get away.

01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:21.078
So suppose nobody stops for us?

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:24.581
They'll stop, all right. It's a
matter of knowing how to hail 'em.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.583
Oh, and you're an expert, I suppose.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:28.794
"Expert"? I'm gonna
write a book about it.

01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:30.921
Call it The Hitchhiker's Hail.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:33.840
There's no end to your
accomplishments, is there?

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.968
- You think it's simple?
- Oh, no.

01:01:36.068 --> 01:01:38.971
It is simple. It's all
in that old thumb, see?

01:01:39.071 --> 01:01:41.014
Some people do it like this...

01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:43.016
or like this.

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:46.311
- All wrong. Never get anywhere.
- Aw, the poor things.

01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:48.480
But that old thumb never fails.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.608
It's all a matter of
how you do it, though.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.610
You take number one, for instance.

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:55.862
That's a short, jerky
movement, like this.

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:59.491
Shows independence. You don't care
whether they stop. You got money.

01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:01.034
Clever.

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:05.546
Number two's a wider movement.
A smile goes with this one, like this.

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:10.168
That means you got a brand-new
story about the farmer's daughter.

01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:13.839
You figured that out all by yourself?

01:02:13.939 --> 01:02:16.758
That's nothing.
Number three is a pip.

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:20.470
That's the pitiful one, when you're broke
and hungry, and everything looks black.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.480
It's a long, sweeping movement.
Got to follow through, though.

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:26.727
That's amazing.

01:02:26.827 --> 01:02:29.604
But it's no good if you
haven't got a long face.

01:02:30.404 --> 01:02:31.681
Here comes a car.

01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:33.984
Okay, watch me.
I'm gonna use number one.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:36.827
Keep your eye on that thumb
and see what happens.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:45.787
I still got my eye on the thumb.

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:48.832
Something must have gone wrong.
I'll try number two.

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:52.134
Well, when you get to
a hundred, wake me up.

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.878
I don't think I'll write
that book after all.

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:38.006
Think of all the fun you had, though.

01:03:39.106 --> 01:03:40.883
Do you mind if I try?

01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:43.470
You?

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.890
Don't make me laugh.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:51.478
Oh, you're such a smart aleck.
Nobody knows anything but you.

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:54.398
I'll stop a car, and I
won't use my thumb.

01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:59.610
- What are you gonna do?
- It's a system all my own.

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:22.300
Aren't you going to give
me a little credit?

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.177
What for?

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:26.346
Well, I proved once and for all...

01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:29.349
that the limb is mightier
than the thumb.

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:32.978
Why didn't you take off all your clothes?
You could have stopped 40 cars.

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:35.805
Ooh, I'll remember that
when we need 40 cars.

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:40.193
So you're just married?
That's pretty good.

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.320
But if I was young...

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:45.115
that's the way I'd spend
my honeymoon: hitchhiking.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:46.908
- Yeah.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:47.008 --> 01:04:50.871
Hitchhiking down the highway of love

01:04:50.971 --> 01:04:54.208
On a honeymoon

01:04:54.308 --> 01:04:58.545
Hitchhiking down, down

01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:03.467
Down the highway

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:07.262
Down

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:09.222
- Down...
- Hey, hey.

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:11.475
Aren't you afraid you'll
burn out a tonsil?

01:05:11.575 --> 01:05:13.817
Tonsil? Me? No.

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:16.980
Me, burn a tonsil!

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.609
My tonsils won't burn
as life's corners I...

01:05:20.709 --> 01:05:22.986
All right, all right. Let it go.

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:25.162
Turn

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:35.040
How about a bite to eat?

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.751
- That would be lovely.
- No, thanks. We're not hungry.

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:40.107
Oh, I see. Young people
in love are never hungry.

01:05:40.208 --> 01:05:43.882
- No.
- Young people in love

01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:48.053
Are very seldom hungry

01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:51.723
Young people in love are very seldom

01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:54.267
Hungry

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:58.146
What were you going to do,
gold-dig that guy for a meal?

01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:01.191
Sure, I was. No fooling: I'm hungry.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.568
Eat a carrot.

01:06:03.668 --> 01:06:05.654
No.

01:06:05.754 --> 01:06:09.706
- I'm going in and asking him.
- You do and I'll break your neck.

01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:24.304
Come on, let's get out
of here. Stretch our legs.

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:30.352
Come on.

01:06:50.799 --> 01:06:52.659
I'm sorry I...

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:55.460
Oh, that's all right.

01:07:04.813 --> 01:07:07.048
Hey! Hey!

01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:09.050
Hey, come here!

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:12.262
Hey, you've got my suitcase! Hey!

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.229
Hey, you!

01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:17.232
Hey! Hey!

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:35.619
What happened to you?
I've been so worried.

01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:37.954
- Get in.
- Look at your face! You've got a cut!

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:40.874
- What happened?
- Just a road thief.

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:43.575
Picks people up, then runs off
with their things. What a racket!

01:07:43.676 --> 01:07:46.427
- How'd you get the car?
- Gave him a black eye.

01:07:46.528 --> 01:07:48.797
Had to tie him to a tree.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.791
Can't be much gas left in this thing.

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:25.091
Got to start promoting some.

01:08:26.978 --> 01:08:30.340
Better take the things out
of the pocket of that coat.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.975
That ought to be good for 10 gallons.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:11.673
I haven't changed my mind, Westley.
I want you to understand that.

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:14.050
I don't like you.
Never have, never will.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:16.176
That's clear enough, isn't it?

01:09:16.277 --> 01:09:18.846
You've made that evident by
your threats of annulment.

01:09:18.947 --> 01:09:20.932
It hasn't worried me for a minute.

01:09:21.032 --> 01:09:23.309
Ellie and I married because
we love each other.

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:25.019
And she's proving it.

01:09:25.118 --> 01:09:27.689
As far as I'm concerned,
there's to be no annulment.

01:09:27.788 --> 01:09:30.817
I see. You've got hold
of a good thing...

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:33.862
and you're going to hang on to it?

01:09:33.962 --> 01:09:35.822
All right. You win.

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:38.700
I guess I'll just have
to get used to you.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.076
I admit I'm licked...

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.662
but it's only because I'm worried.

01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:46.707
If I don't find her soon,
I'll go crazy.

01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:50.002
I might've been able to help
if it hadn't been for you.

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:54.340
- I've been watched so closely...
- Yes, I know. Well, you can help now.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:57.051
I've got a room full
of reporters in there.

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:59.304
Now I want you to make a statement.

01:09:59.404 --> 01:10:03.308
Say that we've talked things over
and come to an understanding...

01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:07.569
and that if she returns, I won't
interfere with your marriage.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:20.575
- Is that all right?
- Yeah, that's quite all right.

01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:22.657
- Okay.
- I hope you and your wife

01:10:22.758 --> 01:10:26.250
- spend a pleasant week with us.
- Yeah, so do I. Thank you.

01:10:26.351 --> 01:10:29.007
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:32.712
- All right, brat.
- Any luck?

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:35.548
Yeah. He finally agreed
to let us have a cabin.

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:38.551
- What about the money?
- I talked him out of that idea.

01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:42.388
He thinks we're staying a week. I'll have
to think something up before morning.

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:46.184
- That's swell.
- Yeah? I'm glad you think so.

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:48.311
If you ask me, I think it's foolish.

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:51.231
I told you there's no use
staying here tonight.

01:10:51.331 --> 01:10:53.824
We could make New
York in three hours.

01:10:57.128 --> 01:11:00.114
I thought you were in
such a hurry to get back.

01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:01.998
Well, I...

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:08.873
Well, whoever heard of getting
in at 3:00 in the morning?

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:11.716
Everybody will be asleep.

01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:18.258
Okay.

01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:20.392
Cottage number six.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.246
There you go, trusting people again.

01:11:48.346 --> 01:11:50.290
How many times did I tell you...

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:54.176
But he looked like a nice,
upright young fellow, Ma.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:02.350
Well, we're on the last lap.

01:12:06.614 --> 01:12:09.183
Tomorrow morning, you'll be
in the arms of your husband.

01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:11.026
Yeah.

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:14.480
You'll have a great story, won't you?

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.816
Yeah.

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:18.783
Swell.

01:12:39.939 --> 01:12:41.890
Thank you.

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:19.010
Well, we certainly
outsmarted your father.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.430
I guess you ought to be happy.

01:13:23.274 --> 01:13:25.809
Am I going to see you in New York?

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:29.771
Nope.

01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:33.559
Why not?

01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:37.529
I don't make it a policy to run
around with married women.

01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:42.117
There's no harm in
your coming to see us.

01:13:43.211 --> 01:13:44.995
Not interested.

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:50.159
Won't I ever see you again?

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:53.371
What do you want to see me for?
I've served my purpose.

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:56.548
I brought you back to King Westley.
That's what you wanted.

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:35.628
Have you ever been in love, Peter?

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:38.923
Me?

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:41.634
Yes.

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:45.555
Haven't you ever thought
about it at all?

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:51.770
It seems to me you could make
some girl wonderfully happy.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:55.683
Sure, I've thought about it.

01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:57.942
Who hasn't?

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:04.025
If I could ever meet
the right sort of girl...

01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:06.527
Yeah, well, where are
you gonna find her?

01:15:06.627 --> 01:15:08.988
Somebody that's real.
Somebody that's alive.

01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:11.289
They don't come that way anymore.

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:18.421
Have I ever thought about it?

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:23.176
Boy, I've even been sucker
enough to make plans.

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:28.299
You know...

01:15:28.399 --> 01:15:31.385
I saw an island in the Pacific once.

01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:33.686
Never been able to forget it.

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:38.650
That's where I'd like to take her.

01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:43.523
But she'd have to be
the sort of girl who...

01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:48.284
who'd jump in the surf with me
and love it as much as I did.

01:15:49.921 --> 01:15:52.949
You know...

01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:55.409
nights when you and the moon...

01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:58.037
and the water all become one...

01:15:58.137 --> 01:16:02.257
and you feel you're part of
something big and marvelous.

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:07.922
That's the only place to live.

01:16:08.022 --> 01:16:10.341
The stars are so close
over your head...

01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:13.685
you feel you could reach
up and stir them around.

01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:21.568
Certainly I've been
thinking about it.

01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:26.448
Boy, if I could ever find a girl
who was hungry for those thi...

01:16:34.298 --> 01:16:37.201
Take me with you, Peter.
Take me to your island.

01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:40.830
I want to do all those
things you talked about.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:43.958
You'd better go back to your bed.

01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:46.586
I love you. Nothing else matters.

01:16:46.686 --> 01:16:50.298
We can run away.
Everything will take care of itself.

01:16:50.398 --> 01:16:52.091
Please, Peter.

01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:55.720
I can't let you out of my life now.

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:57.930
I couldn't live without you.

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:14.329
You'd better go back to your bed.

01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:25.256
I'm sorry.

01:18:01.052 --> 01:18:03.829
Hey, brat.

01:18:03.929 --> 01:18:06.631
Did you mean that?
Would you really go?

01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:49.709
All I'm asking is enough
gas to get me to New York.

01:18:49.809 --> 01:18:51.585
That bag's worth $25.

01:18:51.685 --> 01:18:54.714
I got a bag. My wife gave
me one for Christmas.

01:18:54.814 --> 01:18:58.009
When I get back in the
morning, I'll buy it back.

01:18:58.109 --> 01:19:00.553
Give you a $10 profit.
What do you say?

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:02.722
- I ain't got a hat.
- What?

01:19:02.822 --> 01:19:04.557
I ain't got a hat.

01:19:04.657 --> 01:19:07.775
You got one now!
Come on, fill 'er up.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.527
Peter, where you been all this time?

01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:19.405
- Everybody been asking about you.
- Okay, Tony. Look.

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:21.907
Get me one drink.
Don't let anybody disturb me.

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:23.708
Sure, boss.

01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:28.748
- Hello, Agnes.
- Don't go in. He'll shoot you on sight.

01:19:28.848 --> 01:19:30.750
Haven't been shot at in days.

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:32.752
Get out of here! Get out!

01:19:32.852 --> 01:19:34.545
- Get out!
- Listen, Joe.

01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:36.797
- Don't "Joe" me.
- Joe, listen.

01:19:36.897 --> 01:19:38.716
You know I've always liked you.

01:19:38.816 --> 01:19:42.595
Anytime I ran across a good story,
I came running to you with it.

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:46.349
I got one now. Those wires were on the
level. The biggest scoop of the year!

01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:48.642
- I'm giving it to you.
- About the Andrews kid?

01:19:48.742 --> 01:19:51.729
I've got it written up.
All I want is a thousand bucks.

01:19:51.829 --> 01:19:53.147
A thousand bucks? Get out...

01:19:53.247 --> 01:19:56.442
Don't get sore. This is
something you gotta do for me.

01:19:56.542 --> 01:19:59.820
- I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
- What's the thousand bucks for?

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.947
- To tear down the walls of Jericho.
- What?

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:05.451
Never mind. Andrews is going
to have her marriage annulled.

01:20:05.551 --> 01:20:07.758
- To marry somebody else.
- You're drunk.

01:20:07.859 --> 01:20:09.789
Would that story be
worth a thousand bucks?

01:20:09.889 --> 01:20:12.674
- If it was on the level.
- I got it, Joe.

01:20:15.102 --> 01:20:18.096
- Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
- I am, Joe.

01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:21.467
- You?
- Yeah.

01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:24.720
Now I know you're drunk. I'm going
home. Don't annoy me anymore.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.473
For heaven's sake, stop being
an editor for a minute.

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:31.310
We've known each other a
long time. This is on the level.

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:34.939
I met her on a bus from Miami.
I've been with her every minute.

01:20:35.039 --> 01:20:38.317
I'm in love with her. You got
to get me this money now.

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:41.028
She's waiting for me in an auto
camp outside Philadelphia.

01:20:41.128 --> 01:20:43.823
I gotta get right back.
She doesn't know I'm gone.

01:20:43.923 --> 01:20:47.701
A guy can't propose to a gal without
a cent in the world, can he?

01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:49.495
What a story.

01:20:49.595 --> 01:20:52.123
On her way to join her husband,
Ellen Andrews...

01:20:52.223 --> 01:20:54.090
That's it, that's it.

01:20:55.309 --> 01:20:57.635
Let me see that a minute.

01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:01.882
Zeke? Zeke!

01:21:01.982 --> 01:21:04.009
Zeke!

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:06.512
I told you you couldn't trust him.

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:08.472
- He's gone.
- Who?

01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:12.685
That fellow who was gonna stay a week.
He skipped and took the car too.

01:21:12.785 --> 01:21:16.355
We wouldn't have known till morning
if I hadn't took that magnesia. Get up.

01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:18.941
Don't lay there.
Let's do something about it.

01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:22.153
There ain't nothing we
can do if he's gone.

01:21:36.058 --> 01:21:39.795
- See that? They're gone.
- Looks like it, don't it?

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:42.047
What's this?

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:44.216
Ma, here's the woman.

01:21:44.316 --> 01:21:46.093
- Oh!
- What's the matter?

01:21:46.193 --> 01:21:48.512
- Where's your husband?
- "Husband"?

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:50.813
Yes, if he is your husband.

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:55.686
- Isn't he here?
- No, he ain't. The car's gone too.

01:21:55.786 --> 01:21:57.605
Oh.

01:21:57.705 --> 01:21:59.940
You got any money?

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.734
- No.
- Then you'll have to git.

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:04.160
Yeah, you'll have to git.

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:09.325
Please, may I use your phone?
I've got to call New York.

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:11.744
You ain't gonna stick
me for no phone call.

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:15.963
Go to the sheriff's office, a quarter
mile down the road. They'll fix you up.

01:22:17.641 --> 01:22:20.384
And listen, next time you
better not come back here.

01:22:20.561 --> 01:22:22.804
I run a respectable place.

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:28.594
- Thanks. You saved my life.
- So long, kid.

01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:30.679
- Good luck.
- Thanks. Good-bye, Agnes.

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:33.891
Oh, you're beautiful!
All women are beautiful.

01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:37.269
For my dough, he's still the best
newspaperman in the business.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:40.564
- Get Hank, quick. Boy, what a yarn!
- Hello?

01:22:40.664 --> 01:22:43.275
Hold up the morning edition.
Break down the front page.

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:46.529
Complete new layout.
Send in a couple rewrite men.

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:50.658
Hank, don't do a thing. I've got a
story that will make your hair curl.

01:22:50.758 --> 01:22:52.910
Wait a minute.
Don't annoy me. I'm busy.

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:57.373
Agnes, send Mac in here! Dig up all
the pictures on that Andrews kid.

01:22:57.473 --> 01:23:00.209
And Hank, get Healy out of bed.

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:02.795
I want a cartoon,
and I want it quick.

01:23:02.895 --> 01:23:05.089
King Westley's in it,
waiting at the church...

01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:07.007
with tears streaming down his face.

01:23:07.107 --> 01:23:09.802
The bride didn't show up.
Old man Andrews is laughing.

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:12.221
Everything exaggerated. Snap into it.

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:14.480
Yeah, what is it? Huh?

01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:18.769
Ellen Andrews? You're crazy.

01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:23.023
No, I'm not. She phoned her father
from an auto camp to come get her.

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:25.693
He's getting a police escort,
and Westley's going along.

01:23:25.793 --> 01:23:27.861
Yeah, she's been traveling by bus.

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:31.240
The moment she found out her father
and Westley made up, she phoned.

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:33.951
Okay, grab a car and stay with them.

01:23:34.051 --> 01:23:36.245
Get Hank again. Agnes!

01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:38.872
Get me a doctor. I'm gonna
have a nervous breakdown.

01:23:38.972 --> 01:23:42.167
Hank, forget what I told you.
I'm having a nightmare. Agnes!

01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:44.545
Call the police.
Tell them to find Peter Warne.

01:23:44.645 --> 01:23:47.548
Send out a general alarm.
I want that dirty crook pinched!

01:23:47.648 --> 01:23:49.967
- Do you want us?
- Everything off the front page!

01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:52.428
Ellen Andrews just phoned
her father. She's going home.

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:56.348
The minute she found out the old man withdrew
his objections, she gave herself up.

01:23:56.448 --> 01:23:59.226
Spread it all over! Play it
up big! Here's your lead:

01:23:59.326 --> 01:24:03.272
- "Love Triumphant." Go on, hop to it!
- Okay.

01:24:17.845 --> 01:24:19.538
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:24:19.638 --> 01:24:22.791
We gotta get there
before she wakes up.

01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:34.936
Can't you drive any faster?

01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:40.434
Young people in love

01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:43.395
Are never hungry

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:55.873
Come on, baby!
We've got a police escort.

01:25:06.685 --> 01:25:10.346
Come on, baby. They can't
make a sucker out of us.

01:25:14.193 --> 01:25:16.428
- Get back.
- Get 'em back.

01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:20.099
Step back. Give 'em room, boys.

01:25:20.199 --> 01:25:23.268
- Quite a long trip, isn't it?
- How about a statement?

01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:27.363
Wait till she gets home.
Later, boys. Later.

01:25:35.005 --> 01:25:40.244
Oh, he floats through the air
with the greatest of ease

01:25:40.344 --> 01:25:43.747
The daring young man
on the flying trapeze

01:25:54.357 --> 01:25:55.469
Hiya!

01:25:58.569 --> 01:26:00.305
Hey, get that thing out of the way!

01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:04.525
Keep your britches on!
We'll get it out of the way.

01:26:05.744 --> 01:26:08.397
Hiya!

01:26:26.974 --> 01:26:28.799
Hey, you darn fool!

01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:39.060
Hey!

01:27:34.499 --> 01:27:38.702
Hey, Pete, Ellen Andrews is going
to marry that Westley guy again.

01:27:47.054 --> 01:27:50.582
- Gordon's out back someplace.
- Yeah?

01:27:50.682 --> 01:27:54.552
When he comes in, give him this.
Tell him I was just kidding.

01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:59.591
- You can't get a thing done around here.
- Peter Warne was just in.

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:01.153
- What?
- He left this money.

01:28:01.254 --> 01:28:03.583
- Said to tell you he was kidding.
- Where is he?

01:28:03.684 --> 01:28:06.038
- There.
- Hey, Pete!

01:28:08.659 --> 01:28:10.185
Hello, Joe.

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:14.106
Sorry. It was just a little gag.
I thought I'd have some fun with you.

01:28:14.206 --> 01:28:16.775
Yeah, sure. You had
me going for a while.

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:19.945
- Wouldn't have made a bad story.
- No. Great.

01:28:20.045 --> 01:28:23.657
But that's the way things go.
You think you got a great yarn...

01:28:23.757 --> 01:28:26.910
and then something comes along
and messes up the finish...

01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:28.787
and there you are.

01:28:28.887 --> 01:28:31.964
Yeah. Where am I?

01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:39.930
When you sober up,
come in and talk to me.

01:28:41.024 --> 01:28:42.766
Thanks.

01:29:07.259 --> 01:29:10.412
- Ellie?
- Oh, hello, Dad.

01:29:10.512 --> 01:29:13.248
I knocked several times.

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:15.834
I'm sorry. I must have
been daydreaming.

01:29:15.934 --> 01:29:18.170
Well, everything's set.

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:20.464
Creating quite a furor too.

01:29:20.564 --> 01:29:23.342
Great stunt King is going to pull.

01:29:23.442 --> 01:29:27.095
- "Stunt"?
- Yes, landing on the lawn in an autogyro.

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:29.014
Oh. Oh, yes.

01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:31.642
Yes, I heard.

01:29:31.742 --> 01:29:34.561
Yes, personally,
I think it's silly too.

01:29:34.661 --> 01:29:36.730
You look lovely, child.

01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:39.031
Are you pleased with the gown?

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:43.028
Ellie?

01:29:43.128 --> 01:29:44.905
Oh, the gown.

01:29:45.005 --> 01:29:47.498
Yes, it's nice, isn't it?

01:29:52.596 --> 01:29:54.880
What's the matter, child?

01:29:57.476 --> 01:30:00.379
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:30:00.479 --> 01:30:02.756
You haven't changed your
mind about King, have you?

01:30:02.856 --> 01:30:04.800
Oh, no, no.

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:09.304
Because if you have, it isn't too late.
You know how I feel about him.

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:12.599
You gave me such a scare
when I couldn't find you.

01:30:12.699 --> 01:30:15.852
You know, the old pump
isn't what it used to be.

01:30:15.952 --> 01:30:19.022
I'm sorry, Father.
I wouldn't hurt you for anything.

01:30:19.122 --> 01:30:20.899
You know that.

01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:23.902
What's the matter, child?

01:30:24.002 --> 01:30:25.696
Aren't you happy?

01:30:28.507 --> 01:30:30.701
I thought so.

01:30:30.801 --> 01:30:33.495
I knew there was
something on your mind.

01:30:33.595 --> 01:30:37.339
There, there, there, now.

01:30:39.476 --> 01:30:41.878
What's the matter?

01:30:41.978 --> 01:30:45.723
You haven't fallen in love
with someone else, have you?

01:30:47.901 --> 01:30:49.727
Have you?

01:30:52.781 --> 01:30:55.858
I haven't seen you cry
since you were a baby.

01:30:56.701 --> 01:30:58.902
This must be serious.

01:31:00.372 --> 01:31:02.573
Where'd you meet him?

01:31:03.917 --> 01:31:05.569
On the road.

01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:08.613
Don't tell me you've fallen
in love with a bus driver.

01:31:08.713 --> 01:31:10.914
Oh, no.

01:31:14.636 --> 01:31:16.378
Who is he?

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:20.375
I don't know very much about him...

01:31:20.475 --> 01:31:22.502
except that I love him.

01:31:22.602 --> 01:31:26.173
Well, if it's as serious as all that,
we'll move heaven and earth...

01:31:26.273 --> 01:31:29.301
No, it's no use. He despises me.

01:31:29.401 --> 01:31:31.636
- Oh, come, now!
- Yes, he does.

01:31:31.736 --> 01:31:34.306
He despises everything about me.

01:31:34.406 --> 01:31:37.184
He says that I'm
spoiled and selfish...

01:31:37.284 --> 01:31:40.103
and pampered and
thoroughly insincere.

01:31:40.203 --> 01:31:42.397
Oh, ridiculous!

01:31:42.497 --> 01:31:44.816
He doesn't think so
much of you either.

01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:46.485
Well, I...

01:31:46.585 --> 01:31:49.404
He blames you for everything
that's wrong with me.

01:31:49.504 --> 01:31:52.157
He says you raised me stupidly.

01:31:52.257 --> 01:31:55.410
That's a fine man
to fall in love with!

01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:57.454
Oh, he's marvelous.

01:31:57.554 --> 01:32:00.040
Well, what are we
going to do about it?

01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:02.000
Where is he?

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:04.669
- I don't know.
- I'd like to talk with him.

01:32:04.769 --> 01:32:06.922
It wouldn't do any good.

01:32:07.022 --> 01:32:09.925
I practically threw myself at him.

01:32:10.025 --> 01:32:13.678
Under the circumstances, don't you
think we'd better call this thing off?

01:32:13.778 --> 01:32:16.681
No, no. No, I'll go through with it.

01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:19.851
But that's silly, seeing the
way you feel about him.

01:32:19.951 --> 01:32:23.271
No, it doesn't matter. I don't
want to stir up any more trouble.

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:25.607
I've done it all my life.

01:32:25.707 --> 01:32:29.986
I've made your life miserable,
and mine too.

01:32:30.086 --> 01:32:32.614
I'm tired, Father.

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:36.118
I'm tired of running
around in circles.

01:32:36.218 --> 01:32:39.962
He's right. That's what I've been
doing ever since I can remember.

01:32:40.764 --> 01:32:43.375
I've got to settle down.

01:32:43.475 --> 01:32:46.844
It doesn't matter how
or where or with whom.

01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:50.882
You've changed, Ellie.

01:32:50.982 --> 01:32:53.343
I can't walk out on King now.

01:32:53.443 --> 01:32:56.019
It would make us all
look so ridiculous.

01:32:57.155 --> 01:33:01.393
Anyway, what difference does it make?

01:33:01.493 --> 01:33:03.603
I'll never see Peter again.

01:33:03.703 --> 01:33:06.148
Is that his name?

01:33:06.248 --> 01:33:08.991
Yes. Peter Warne.

01:33:10.168 --> 01:33:12.244
"Peter Warne."

01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:18.160
- Why? Do you know him?
- Why, no, no.

01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:20.704
Father, you haven't heard
from him, have you?

01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:22.914
- Don't be silly...
- Oh, please!

01:33:23.014 --> 01:33:24.840
What's that?

01:33:36.987 --> 01:33:40.432
Well, I guess that was his only
interest in me, wasn't it?

01:33:40.532 --> 01:33:42.100
The reward.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:45.020
- I'm sorry you read it.
- Are you going to see him?

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.189
I suppose so.

01:33:47.289 --> 01:33:49.941
Certainly! Pay him off!

01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:52.611
He's entitled to it.
He did an excellent job.

01:33:52.711 --> 01:33:57.199
He kept me thoroughly entertained.
It's worth every penny he gets.

01:33:57.299 --> 01:33:59.534
Thank you, Mary.
That's just what I needed.

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:02.245
Mr. Westley's on his way up.

01:34:02.345 --> 01:34:04.546
Fine. Have him come in.

01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:12.763
I'll be going.

01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:17.476
Oh.

01:34:23.742 --> 01:34:27.145
If it isn't the bridegroom himself!
You're just in time, King.

01:34:27.245 --> 01:34:29.231
How are you, Ellie?

01:34:29.331 --> 01:34:31.066
- Are you happy?
- "Happy"?

01:34:31.166 --> 01:34:33.401
Why shouldn't I be happy?

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:36.780
Here we are. Let's drink.
Well, it's up to you now.

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:40.700
I want our life to be full of excitement.
We'll never let up, will we?

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.577
Never a dull moment.

01:34:42.677 --> 01:34:45.330
We'll get on a merry-go-round
and never get off.

01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:48.583
- Promise you'll never let me get off.
- Whatever you say, darling.

01:34:48.683 --> 01:34:50.634
It's a promise.

01:35:04.407 --> 01:35:07.519
Hello. Yeah?

01:35:07.619 --> 01:35:10.522
Who? Oh.

01:35:10.622 --> 01:35:12.816
Why can't I see you at your office?

01:35:12.916 --> 01:35:16.569
I'm leaving for Washington tonight.
I may be gone several weeks.

01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:19.781
I thought perhaps you'd like
to get this thing settled.

01:35:19.881 --> 01:35:23.243
Yeah. But I don't like the idea
of butting in on your jamboree.

01:35:23.343 --> 01:35:26.162
Between you and me,
those things give me a stiff pain.

01:35:26.262 --> 01:35:29.624
You don't have to see anybody.
You can come directly to my study.

01:35:29.724 --> 01:35:32.384
No, no, no. Why do I want to...

01:35:35.397 --> 01:35:37.215
Hey, wait a minute.

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:39.968
Maybe I will come over. Yeah.

01:35:40.068 --> 01:35:43.096
I'd like to get a load of that
three-ring circus you're pulling.

01:35:43.196 --> 01:35:46.016
I want to see what love looks
like when it's triumphant.

01:35:46.116 --> 01:35:48.609
I haven't had a good laugh in a week.

01:35:50.787 --> 01:35:53.363
- Mr. Warne?
- Yeah.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.611
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

01:35:58.711 --> 01:36:02.365
I was surprised to get your note.
My daughter hadn't told me...

01:36:02.465 --> 01:36:04.492
anything about you,
about your helping her.

01:36:04.592 --> 01:36:07.245
That's typical of your daughter.
Takes those things for granted.

01:36:07.345 --> 01:36:10.498
Why did she think I lugged
her all the way from Miami?

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:13.418
She thinks you're entitled
to anything you can get.

01:36:13.518 --> 01:36:16.379
She does? Isn't that sweet of her?

01:36:16.479 --> 01:36:19.507
- You don't, I suppose.
- Well, I don't know.

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:22.302
I'll have to see on what
you base your claim.

01:36:22.402 --> 01:36:24.429
I presume you feel justified.

01:36:24.529 --> 01:36:28.065
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
I got it all itemized.

01:36:30.452 --> 01:36:33.646
"Cash outlay: $8.60.

01:36:33.746 --> 01:36:37.108
Topcoat: $15. Suitcase: $7.50.

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:40.744
Hat: $4.00. Three shirts: $4.50.

01:36:41.546 --> 01:36:44.657
Total: $39.60.

01:36:44.757 --> 01:36:47.869
All the above items had to
be sold to buy gasoline."

01:36:47.969 --> 01:36:51.164
I sold some shorts and socks too.
I'm throwing those in.

01:36:51.264 --> 01:36:54.501
- Yes, I know.
- What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough?

01:36:54.601 --> 01:36:57.629
Trip like that would cost you a
thousand dollars, maybe more.

01:36:57.729 --> 01:37:00.465
Let me get this straight.
You want 39.60...

01:37:00.565 --> 01:37:02.717
in addition to the $10,000?

01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:04.969
What 10,000?

01:37:05.069 --> 01:37:08.932
- The reward.
- Who said anything about a reward?

01:37:09.032 --> 01:37:11.726
I'm afraid I'm a little bit confused.

01:37:11.826 --> 01:37:14.687
- I assumed that...
- Look, all I want is 39.60.

01:37:14.787 --> 01:37:17.899
If you give me a check,
I'll get out of this joint.

01:37:17.999 --> 01:37:19.984
It gives me the jitters.

01:37:20.084 --> 01:37:23.071
- You're a peculiar chap.
- We'll go into that some other time.

01:37:23.171 --> 01:37:25.990
The average man would
go after the reward...

01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:28.618
Did anybody ever make
a sucker out of you?

01:37:28.718 --> 01:37:31.579
This is a matter of principle, something
you probably wouldn't understand.

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:35.567
When anybody takes me for a buggy ride,
I don't like having to pay for the privilege.

01:37:35.667 --> 01:37:39.712
- Were you taken for a buggy ride?
- Yes, with all the trimmings.

01:37:39.812 --> 01:37:42.924
- So how about the check? Do I get it?
- Certainly.

01:37:43.024 --> 01:37:44.975
Thanks.

01:37:58.581 --> 01:38:02.277
- There you are.
- Thank you.

01:38:02.377 --> 01:38:05.989
Do you mind if I ask you
a question, frankly?

01:38:06.089 --> 01:38:08.331
Do you love my daughter?

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:13.121
Any guy in love with your daughter
oughta have his head examined.

01:38:13.221 --> 01:38:16.291
- That's an evasion.
- She picked a perfect running mate:

01:38:16.391 --> 01:38:18.501
King Westley,
the pill of the century.

01:38:18.601 --> 01:38:22.922
She needs a guy that'd sock her once
a day whether it's coming to her or not.

01:38:23.022 --> 01:38:24.727
If you had half the brains
you're supposed to,

01:38:24.828 --> 01:38:27.307
- you'd have done it yourself.
- Do you love her?

01:38:27.408 --> 01:38:30.430
A normal human being couldn't
live with her without going nutty!

01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:34.184
- She's my idea of nothing.
- I asked a simple question: Do you love her?

01:38:34.284 --> 01:38:37.312
Yes! But don't hold that against me.
I'm a little screwy myself.

01:38:40.081 --> 01:38:44.159
Well, here's to the merry-go-round.

01:38:49.632 --> 01:38:52.667
Perfect. Now you look natural.

01:38:57.849 --> 01:39:00.752
- I hope you got your money.
- You bet I did.

01:39:00.852 --> 01:39:03.755
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Same to you.

01:39:03.855 --> 01:39:06.925
Stay around and watch the fun.
You'll enjoy it immensely.

01:39:07.025 --> 01:39:09.392
I would, but I've got a weak stomach.

01:39:15.742 --> 01:39:17.442
I just had a long talk with him.

01:39:17.543 --> 01:39:20.039
- I'm not interested.
- Just a minute, Ellie.

01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:22.923
I don't want to hear
another word about him.

01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:38.289
Come on, folks. King Westley
has arrived. Come on!

01:40:32.318 --> 01:40:34.477
There they come, boys. Turn 'em over.

01:41:03.307 --> 01:41:05.717
You're a sucker to
go through with this.

01:41:06.978 --> 01:41:11.132
That guy Warne is okay.
He didn't want the reward.

01:41:11.232 --> 01:41:15.470
All he asked for was $39.60,
what he spent on you.

01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:19.940
Said it was a matter of principle.
You took him for a ride.

01:41:26.372 --> 01:41:30.200
He loves you, Ellie. He told me so.

01:41:31.878 --> 01:41:35.156
You don't want to be married
to a mug like Westley.

01:41:35.256 --> 01:41:37.958
I can buy him off for a pot of gold.

01:41:41.721 --> 01:41:46.751
And you can make an old man happy
and you won't do so bad for yourself.

01:41:46.851 --> 01:41:50.428
If you change your mind,
your car's waiting at the back gate.

01:42:01.783 --> 01:42:03.851
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered together here...

01:42:03.951 --> 01:42:06.821
in the sight of God and in
the face of this company...

01:42:06.921 --> 01:42:10.024
to join together this man
and woman in holy matrimony.

01:42:10.124 --> 01:42:14.278
If any man can show just cause why they
may not lawfully be joined together...

01:42:14.378 --> 01:42:19.290
let him now speak or else
hereafter forever hold his peace.

01:42:21.427 --> 01:42:24.288
King, wilt thou have this
woman to thy wedded wife...

01:42:24.388 --> 01:42:27.882
- so long as ye both shall live?
- I will.

01:42:28.768 --> 01:42:32.672
Ellen, wilt thou have this man
to thy wedded husband...

01:42:32.772 --> 01:42:34.973
so long as ye both shall live?

01:42:38.436 --> 01:42:41.097
- Ellen!
- Ellen! Ellen!

01:42:41.197 --> 01:42:42.807
Ellie!

01:42:53.835 --> 01:42:56.619
Where has she gone?

01:43:12.436 --> 01:43:16.014
- What happened?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

01:43:30.913 --> 01:43:33.232
Don't want to talk to...

01:43:33.332 --> 01:43:36.319
Don't want to talk to anybody.
Don't want to see anybody.

01:43:36.419 --> 01:43:38.488
But it's King Westley on the phone.

01:43:41.924 --> 01:43:45.495
Hello, my would-be ex-son-in-law.

01:43:45.595 --> 01:43:48.539
I've sent you a check
for a hundred thousand.

01:43:48.639 --> 01:43:51.209
That's the smartest thing
you ever did, Westley...

01:43:51.309 --> 01:43:53.461
not to contest that annulment.

01:43:53.561 --> 01:43:57.465
That's satisfactory, isn't it?
Well, it oughta be.

01:43:57.565 --> 01:44:00.676
I'm not complaining.
Oh, no. Not complaining.

01:44:00.776 --> 01:44:02.804
It was dirt cheap.

01:44:02.904 --> 01:44:05.522
Don't fall out of any windows!

01:44:06.657 --> 01:44:10.353
There's another wire from Peter.
They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.

01:44:10.453 --> 01:44:14.398
"What's holding up
the annulment, you slowpoke?

01:44:14.498 --> 01:44:17.617
The walls of Jericho are toppling."

01:44:19.128 --> 01:44:24.249
Send him a telegram right away.
Just say, "Let 'em topple."

01:44:26.677 --> 01:44:28.955
- Funny couple, ain't they?
- Yeah.

01:44:29.055 --> 01:44:31.415
If you ask me, I don't
believe they're married.

01:44:31.515 --> 01:44:33.918
They're married, all right.
I just seen the license.

01:44:34.018 --> 01:44:36.879
They made me get 'em a
rope and a blanket.

01:44:36.979 --> 01:44:39.549
On a night like this!
What do you reckon that's for?

01:44:39.649 --> 01:44:43.057
- Blamed if I know. I brung 'em a trumpet.
- A trumpet?

01:44:43.158 --> 01:44:45.847
One of them toy things.
