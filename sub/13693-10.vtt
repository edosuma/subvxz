00:16.686 --> 00:17.979
Hello.

00:19.605 --> 00:20.982
Come here.

00:30.532 --> 00:33.077
What's his name?

00:33.161 --> 00:36.414
-Useless.
-Aw, who called him that?

00:46.257 --> 00:50.386
-What are you gonna
tell your mother about me?
-Nothing.

00:52.805 --> 00:54.307
What about us?

00:55.433 --> 00:58.061
What would Hector have wanted?

00:58.144 --> 00:59.854
My father is dead.

01:08.446 --> 01:10.114
(USELESS WHINING)

01:17.580 --> 01:18.831
Useless.

02:02.125 --> 02:05.628
-You can't just send him away.
-I just did.

02:08.589 --> 02:11.634
-Morning all.
-ALL: Morning.

02:11.717 --> 02:16.139
-Tea, coffee.
-Oh, that is so kind.

02:16.222 --> 02:20.852
Well, Lexie,
last night was wonderful.
Everything was perfect.

02:20.935 --> 02:24.731
-Almost perfect.
-GOLLY:
It was a triumph, lass.

02:24.814 --> 02:28.443
-The whole day went off
pretty well, eh, Arch?
-Mmm?

02:28.526 --> 02:32.905
Well, you know, Big Eric
being, well,
exactly where I said he'd be.

02:32.989 --> 02:34.824
We're a good team.

02:36.701 --> 02:40.538
I think I'll have a quiet day,
contemplating
a life of leisure,

02:40.621 --> 02:44.542
now that we have a new
and very capable
Lady of Glenbogle.

02:44.625 --> 02:48.296
-I've got a lot to learn.
-So have I.

02:48.379 --> 02:51.674
Still, I hope life will
still spring a few surprises.

02:51.758 --> 02:55.303
-Coffee, Mother?
-Thank you.

02:55.385 --> 02:57.889
Do you know,
I'd love to travel again.

02:57.972 --> 03:01.641
Now, why would you do that?
Why would anyone
want to leave here?

03:01.726 --> 03:05.772
Well, a man has to
settle sometime, somewhere.

03:05.855 --> 03:09.400
It sounds suspiciously like
pipe and slippers to me.

03:09.484 --> 03:13.237
You're much too
young for that.

03:13.321 --> 03:17.492
Oh, look, there's Useless
with that young
man from last night.

03:17.575 --> 03:19.410
LEXIE: Oh, so it is.

03:20.578 --> 03:22.080
Excuse me.

03:22.163 --> 03:26.292
Would you like some
more coffee, Molly?

03:26.376 --> 03:29.629
I couldn't shake her.
She's taken
a real shine to me.

03:29.712 --> 03:32.674
-What do you want from us?
-I came to return your dog.

03:32.757 --> 03:35.301
A word of thanks
might be a start.

03:36.844 --> 03:38.136
Thank you.

03:39.806 --> 03:42.517
-Now, please...
-What? Get off my land?

03:42.600 --> 03:45.103
You have no right to wreck
my mother's life.

03:45.186 --> 03:48.272
Oh, that's rich. What
about my mother? Her life.

03:48.356 --> 03:49.565
Who do you think
wrecked that?

03:49.649 --> 03:51.359
Let's not start a slaging
match here.

03:51.442 --> 03:54.112
I'm sorry, but that's in the
past and that's where
it should stay.

03:54.195 --> 03:57.657
It does affect all of us,
especially Molly.

03:57.740 --> 04:00.535
-Somebody mention me?
-It's nothing, Mother.

04:00.618 --> 04:03.496
What affects especially me?

04:03.579 --> 04:07.542
Hector's son.
But that makes Molly his mum.

04:07.625 --> 04:10.837
Molly,
is not Paul's mother, Duncan.

04:12.547 --> 04:16.384
Hector MacDonald,
you dirty dog.

04:22.181 --> 04:24.892
-Morning, Kilwillie.
-Looking for Archie.

04:24.976 --> 04:28.146
-Belated gift for
the intended honeymoon.
-That's rather generous.

04:28.229 --> 04:30.147
Two round the world air
tickets, first class, that's

04:30.231 --> 04:32.442
slightly more than rather,
old boy.

04:32.525 --> 04:36.362
-Molly will be very impressed.
-That never crossed my mind.

04:38.114 --> 04:39.782
You didn't know
Hector like I did.

04:39.866 --> 04:43.494
Do you think he
could have kept this
from me for, what, 30 years?

04:43.578 --> 04:45.913
Longer. I was born in '66.

04:50.752 --> 04:57.133
You and countless others.
You'll be blaming him
for all of them next.

04:57.216 --> 05:01.596
-I'm not blaming anyone.
-Excuse me, I've got
a thousand things to do.

05:11.314 --> 05:12.440
Paul.

05:17.653 --> 05:20.823
-Oh, Molly,
I think you'll be pleased...
-Not now, Kilwillie.

05:20.907 --> 05:23.409
-Oh, I say, Archie...
-Later, Kilwillie.

05:23.493 --> 05:26.120
-Lexie...
-A wee bit busy, Kilwillie.

05:29.916 --> 05:31.834
Is he telling the truth?

05:31.918 --> 05:34.087
There's a letter from the
estate's solicitors.

05:34.170 --> 05:35.880
I'm afraid there's very
little doubt.

05:35.963 --> 05:40.051
These things happen.
Well, heaven knows,
Hector was no saint.

05:41.260 --> 05:44.889
He made a mistake,
end of story.

05:44.972 --> 05:47.850
-Is there anything I can do?
-No. Thank you.

05:51.604 --> 05:53.690
-I told him what
this would do to her.
-Archie, don't...

05:53.772 --> 05:55.942
He had no right to come here.

06:20.133 --> 06:22.969
Maybe you could try
showing a bit of leg.

06:24.429 --> 06:26.431
I brought your mate.

06:30.768 --> 06:34.647
Come on, at least hear me out.

06:34.731 --> 06:39.944
Right, you started this so
you're going to listen to me
whether you like it or not.

06:49.954 --> 06:53.750
He asked me to leave.
How clear do you need it?

06:53.833 --> 06:56.878
You have dropped
a bit of
a bombshell around here.

06:56.961 --> 07:01.591
The dust'll settle and
you can all get back
to what you're best at.

07:01.674 --> 07:03.134
Which is?

07:03.217 --> 07:07.305
Keeping your precious acres
free from the common herd.

07:07.388 --> 07:11.726
Listen, pal, I'm just as
common as you are so don't
come the underdog with me.

07:13.061 --> 07:14.854
You married well.

07:14.937 --> 07:21.069
I married the man that I love,
and believe me,
he is worth the effort.

07:25.406 --> 07:30.203
-I hoped he and I could
get to know each other.
-It takes time.

07:30.286 --> 07:34.040
I haven't got time,
a couple of days at most.

07:34.123 --> 07:36.834
I doubt the ice'll
thaw that quickly.

07:37.835 --> 07:39.504
It's worth a try.

07:40.630 --> 07:43.216
A letter, your Lordship,
a letter.

07:43.299 --> 07:44.801
Very far from unusual,
Badger.

07:44.884 --> 07:49.222
Oh, this one is, sir,
for this one
bears the royal seal.

07:50.473 --> 07:52.641
I've been out
looking high and low.

07:52.725 --> 07:56.229
I guessed you'd gone courting
with Mrs MacDonald again.

07:56.312 --> 08:00.191
No, no, I was just
looking for Archie.

08:00.274 --> 08:03.736
-Good Lord.
-Bad news, your Lordship?

08:03.820 --> 08:05.488
Au contraire.

08:05.571 --> 08:10.785
Kilwillie Spring Water
has been selected
for the Royal Table.

08:10.868 --> 08:12.412
Is that all, sir?

08:12.495 --> 08:15.123
Bested in courtship,
second in Molly's affections,

08:15.206 --> 08:19.127
yet my foot is on
the silken ladder
leading to the ultimate prize.

08:19.210 --> 08:23.381
Kilwillie,
by royal appointment. Ha!

08:26.134 --> 08:28.511
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)

08:34.017 --> 08:37.687
-Does Archie know about this?
-No. Not yet.

08:40.188 --> 08:43.735
He's come
a long way to find us
and he doesn't have much time.

08:43.818 --> 08:46.904
I'm not going
behind Archie's back.

08:46.988 --> 08:50.616
You take care of Paul,
I'll talk to Archie,
see if I can bring him round.

08:50.700 --> 08:53.953
And what about Molly?
Is this not just rubbing
her nose in it a wee bit?

08:54.035 --> 08:57.874
No, it's helping her
face the truth, Golly.

08:57.956 --> 09:02.670
-You might come to
regret starting this, lass.
-I didn't start anything.

09:02.754 --> 09:06.632
Look, he's here,
he's more of
a MacDonald than I am.

09:06.716 --> 09:08.426
I know that.

09:08.509 --> 09:12.430
So, do you not think he
deserves to know something
about his roots?

09:17.226 --> 09:19.228
Archie has to know, mind.

09:29.322 --> 09:31.324
I mean, he doesn't take a
scrap of notice of me.

09:31.407 --> 09:34.077
I may as well be part of the
furniture.

09:36.245 --> 09:40.667
Archie has got
a lot on his mind, son.

09:40.750 --> 09:44.087
-He doesn't mean
to seem ungrateful.
-I mean, like yesterday.

09:44.170 --> 09:47.507
If it wasn't for me, Big Eric
would still be
staggering around out there.

09:47.590 --> 09:49.467
I told you you did a good job.

09:49.550 --> 09:54.013
Yeah,
I know, but a pat on the back
from Archie wouldn't go amiss.

09:54.097 --> 09:56.140
It's my own fault, of course.

09:56.224 --> 09:58.893
Well,
I don't push myself forward.

09:58.976 --> 10:01.646
I'm always in the background
being good old Dunc.

10:01.729 --> 10:06.067
-Well, do it, assert yourself.
-Why?
No one would take any notice.

10:11.823 --> 10:13.950
-Can you hear anything?
-No.

10:15.076 --> 10:17.245
No, neither could I.

10:17.328 --> 10:18.830
(THUDDING)

10:18.913 --> 10:20.498
Dry as a bone.

10:27.839 --> 10:29.716
The brochures came.

10:29.799 --> 10:33.469
Everywhere we talked
about is so expensive.

10:33.553 --> 10:38.224
We got married economy class.
I want our honeymoon to be
something really special.

10:38.307 --> 10:42.770
Something to look back on
when the house is
overrun with...little people.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.482
Don't jump the gun, you.

10:46.566 --> 10:50.319
Anyway, all I need is
for you to be there.

10:51.404 --> 10:53.364
That makes it special.

10:53.448 --> 10:57.410
Well, that and the hot sun
and the golden beaches.

11:01.914 --> 11:04.042
How much do you love me?

11:05.501 --> 11:07.670
Oh, about that much.

11:09.797 --> 11:14.260
-A lot.
-Good, because you'll need to.

11:16.888 --> 11:19.891
-Paul's back.
-You've seen him.

11:19.974 --> 11:24.520
-No. I... I brought him.
-What?

11:24.604 --> 11:27.732
Well, he's Hector's son.
You can't pretend
he doesn't exist.

11:27.815 --> 11:29.859
-Where is he?
-Just hear me out.

11:29.942 --> 11:33.780
-Where is he?
-Paul is part of
this family, okay?

11:33.863 --> 11:38.034
You can't just send him away.
Look, for Molly's sake.

11:38.117 --> 11:41.079
As long as Paul's
a stranger to her
then Hector will be, too.

11:41.162 --> 11:44.082
-She loved my father.
-Yeah, and he betrayed her.

11:44.165 --> 11:45.833
If he was alive today, she
would rant and rave but

11:45.917 --> 11:48.127
eventually she would end up
forgiving him.

11:48.211 --> 11:52.507
-I doubt it.
-Paul is a living
reminder of Hector.

11:52.590 --> 11:56.010
-Just like you are.
-You are wrong
to interfere, Lex.

11:56.094 --> 12:01.265
Archie, this gives me
the right to interfere.
I am part of this family.

12:02.266 --> 12:04.352
-Paul is, too.
-Where is he?

12:06.896 --> 12:08.940
You tell me where he is.

12:11.109 --> 12:14.112
It'll take no
time to dig a trench.

12:14.195 --> 12:16.864
So long as he
comes up with the idea.

12:18.866 --> 12:20.743
Duncan.

12:20.827 --> 12:25.164
Paul was just reminding me
that there's a burn
not 50 yards away.

12:25.248 --> 12:27.917
What do you think?
Have you any ideas?

12:31.212 --> 12:36.551
-It's a fair way to
move a house, Golly.
-So, maybe we could...

12:36.634 --> 12:40.221
-Buy a bucket?
-Buy a bucket. Or?

12:41.723 --> 12:44.684
Hey, we could dig a trench.

12:44.767 --> 12:47.145
-Great idea, mate.
-Excellent.

12:58.781 --> 12:59.949
Badger!

13:11.502 --> 13:13.629
-How are you feeling?
-Fine.

13:15.465 --> 13:20.053
-I wish you could
talk to me about this.
-Why? It's the past.

13:20.136 --> 13:22.680
Live for today,
look forward to tomorrow.

13:22.764 --> 13:25.600
Yeah, but something
as big as this, Molly.

13:27.143 --> 13:30.521
Hector had a fling,
there was a child, that's it.

13:33.107 --> 13:35.318
If you want to talk to him...

13:36.861 --> 13:39.280
-To whom?
-Paul.

13:39.364 --> 13:43.076
-It's not too late.
-Why on earth
should I want to do that?

13:45.703 --> 13:47.455
Where is he?

13:47.538 --> 13:49.082
What are you playing at,
Golly?

13:49.165 --> 13:51.000
I don't believe he
means any harm, Archie.

13:51.084 --> 13:53.753
He's done enough already.
I don't want him
running into my mother again.

13:53.836 --> 13:57.632
Look, I'm concerned about
Molly, too, but the lad has
rights at well.

13:57.715 --> 14:00.551
-Does he?
-Yes,
he does, Archie, and so do I.

14:00.635 --> 14:04.389
A lot of this is my fault,
I have some
amends to make here.

14:07.183 --> 14:13.523
Archie.
That fellow is attempting
to steal my commercial assets.

14:13.606 --> 14:15.858
We're looking for a source
of water for the house.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.694
-What's wrong with the well?
-It's dry.

14:17.777 --> 14:19.320
It was okay last year.

14:19.404 --> 14:22.907
Underground springs
run to their own plan,
not ours.

14:22.990 --> 14:24.742
He can't live here
without water.

14:24.826 --> 14:26.536
Well, he'll have to live
without mine.

14:26.619 --> 14:28.287
I don't know if you've
noticed, Kilwillie, but it

14:28.371 --> 14:30.748
falls from the sky on a
pretty regular basis.

14:30.832 --> 14:34.168
Yes, and what falls
on my land is my own.

14:34.252 --> 14:37.296
Archie.

14:37.380 --> 14:40.133
I don't want to fall
out with you over this,
but dash it all,

14:40.216 --> 14:42.218
my water's about to
furnish the Royal Table.

14:42.301 --> 14:45.555
I can't have it used by
every Tom, Dick and Golly
for their ablutions.

14:45.638 --> 14:50.226
-That is both
petty and insulting.
-Petty?

14:50.309 --> 14:55.189
Archibald MacDonald, consider
our two great and
ancient houses in dispute.

14:56.315 --> 14:59.193
-Okay.
-Oh.

15:00.361 --> 15:02.196
Badger,

15:02.280 --> 15:05.241
Do you see the trouble he's
caused? You shouldn't have
got involved, Golly.

15:05.324 --> 15:08.870
Don't take it out on him.
It's me you
should be talking to.

15:08.953 --> 15:11.622
I have nothing to say to you
that I haven't said already.

15:11.706 --> 15:13.082
Lads. Lads.

15:18.504 --> 15:22.759
-This is not like you, Archie.
-I want him away from here.

15:22.842 --> 15:26.346
No, son, this is my home,
he is my guest.

15:28.222 --> 15:31.351
Right, it's on your head.

15:31.434 --> 15:33.227
And what about Kilwillie?

15:33.311 --> 15:36.105
He is the least of
my problems right now.
You deal with it.

15:49.660 --> 15:50.870
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

15:50.953 --> 15:52.663
Come in.

15:52.747 --> 15:57.835
-I hope this isn't a bad time.
-Not at all. Do sit down.

15:59.671 --> 16:02.590
You've no shortage
of bedtime reading.

16:02.674 --> 16:04.842
Do you know how few I've
actually read? They're just a

16:04.926 --> 16:08.346
silent reminder of how little
I know.

16:10.515 --> 16:13.559
But we learn
through living, don't we?

16:13.643 --> 16:17.355
Although I admit I've been
a bit over
zealous in that regard.

16:17.438 --> 16:21.567
-Bet you wouldn't
change a day of it.
-Maybe the odd day.

16:21.651 --> 16:25.279
Whether it's my age,
or maybe it's this place,

16:26.489 --> 16:28.116
but I'm ready
to change, Molly.

16:28.199 --> 16:31.452
Oh, don't change too much,
you'll completely
lose your mystery.

16:31.536 --> 16:35.665
I don't want to be a mystery,
I want to be
a very good neighbour,

16:35.748 --> 16:38.001
and a good friend.

16:38.084 --> 16:42.296
Another Glenbogle casualty.
People come here and
lose the will to leave.

16:42.380 --> 16:45.466
Why leave, when
everything you want is here?

16:48.386 --> 16:51.055
You and your
husband were very lucky.

16:52.140 --> 16:53.599
My husband?

16:55.685 --> 16:57.812
Yes.

16:57.895 --> 17:03.359
Actually, there is something
that you could do for me,
if you'd be so kind.

17:03.443 --> 17:08.448
Kilwillie Spring Water will be
the most sought after,
the most exclusive,

17:08.531 --> 17:10.532
the most hideously expensive
manifestation of God's great

17:10.616 --> 17:13.869
bounty that ever fell upon
our heads.

17:13.953 --> 17:20.417
Your mission is to guard
every drop and trickle of this
priceless commodity.

17:20.501 --> 17:26.340
Never, in the history of
bottled water, has so much
depended on so few.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.385
Carry on.

17:31.179 --> 17:35.391
Seems Mrs MacDonald
has finally passed him over.

17:37.810 --> 17:43.399
Still looks good to me.
Disciplined drawing,
deft brushwork

17:43.483 --> 17:45.485
and a pretty
sound composition.

17:45.568 --> 17:49.237
But I completely
failed to capture
the character within.

17:49.322 --> 17:51.574
-Where's it going?
-This way.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.707
Mother?

18:00.792 --> 18:02.168
Keep going.

18:05.962 --> 18:09.091
-Can I have a word?
-In here.

18:17.183 --> 18:21.062
Golly needs your support.
Don't abandon
him because of me.

18:21.145 --> 18:25.191
I can't keep you out of
Golly's house, but I can, and
I will, keep you out of mine.

18:25.274 --> 18:27.902
-Why?
-Have you seen my mother?

18:27.985 --> 18:30.822
-This isn't about your mother.
-So her feelings
aren't important?

18:30.905 --> 18:34.909
Of course they are, but
she'll deal with this her own
way, like we have to do.

18:34.992 --> 18:40.164
I don't want this any more
than you, Archie, but we are
brothers, that is a reality.

18:52.010 --> 18:54.554
Paul's right.

18:54.637 --> 18:58.641
There is more to this
than just Molly's feelings.

18:58.725 --> 19:02.562
First Golly, now you.
Why can't we just focus on
what's best for Mother?

19:02.645 --> 19:07.358
Why can't we just think about
what's best for
all of us, Arch?

19:07.442 --> 19:09.944
Well, we'd better start
by cancelling the honeymoon.

19:10.028 --> 19:11.821
What?

19:11.904 --> 19:14.991
I can't leave
here with him around
and my mother like that.

19:21.831 --> 19:24.542
This place rules
our lives, doesn't it?

19:29.172 --> 19:33.551
Glenbogle has to come first.
We're just caretakers, Lex.

19:34.927 --> 19:37.180
We don't own it, it owns us.

19:47.065 --> 19:50.193
Badger.
Some tins from the pantry.

19:50.276 --> 19:54.405
Oh, artichoke hearts,
gentlemen's relish.

19:55.698 --> 19:57.492
And shoe polish.

19:57.575 --> 19:59.619
Thank you, your Lordship.

19:59.702 --> 20:03.873
-Did you happen to
bring a tin opener?
-I thought butlers had those.

20:05.583 --> 20:07.543
Right enough, your Lordship.

20:07.627 --> 20:10.046
I'll collect
these tomorrow morning
when I bring the silver.

20:10.129 --> 20:12.090
Very good, your Lordship.

20:25.770 --> 20:28.898
Molly,
what have you done with it?

20:30.525 --> 20:34.112
Oh, that?
It's where it belongs.

20:34.195 --> 20:38.032
And before you say anything,
the answer is definitely no.

20:38.116 --> 20:39.325
Really?

20:39.409 --> 20:42.203
Nothing to do with Hector,
it was a poor painting

20:42.286 --> 20:44.539
and I've been meaning
to take it down for some time.

20:44.622 --> 20:47.792
-I thought it was
a good painting.
-No, it wasn't.

20:47.875 --> 20:52.922
After all, I should know.
I studied at
the Slade before I came here.

20:53.006 --> 20:56.509
-You don't regret that,
though, do you?
-Heavens, no.

20:56.592 --> 20:58.636
Being the Lady of Glenbogle

20:58.720 --> 21:02.682
in this beautiful, isolated
place and all those
wonderful years with Hector.

21:02.765 --> 21:06.352
Of course I don't regret it.

21:06.436 --> 21:12.817
Whatever you might think, son,
no man gives up his own child
without a great deal of pain.

21:15.486 --> 21:18.489
Sounds like experience.

21:18.573 --> 21:22.869
-It's my daughter.
I've seen her since.
-How did that feel?

21:24.954 --> 21:28.332
Like looking in a mirror.
She was a stranger to me,

21:30.126 --> 21:32.545
but I knew her
like my own hand.

21:35.131 --> 21:40.678
-Can't believe Hector
lost any sleep over me.
-Oh, he did, he did.

21:40.762 --> 21:46.225
Many a time there'd be a knock
on my door in the middle of
the night, there he'd be,

21:46.309 --> 21:48.436
bottle of malt in his hand.

21:50.855 --> 21:54.400
What did he talk about?

21:54.484 --> 22:00.907
What it would be like if he
met you, what you'd look like,
how you were getting on.

22:00.990 --> 22:04.410
Caused me a few
sleepless nights, too,
I can tell you.

22:04.494 --> 22:07.747
Not to mention some
pretty ferocious hangovers.

22:10.667 --> 22:13.378
-I've been thinking.
-And?

22:13.461 --> 22:16.506
And I don't think we should
let Kilwillie call the shots.

22:16.589 --> 22:19.258
I think we should
strike back tomorrow.

23:00.925 --> 23:05.513
I just can't get through
to her, I've tried, but...

23:05.596 --> 23:09.642
-Morning, Mother.
-Kedgeree for breakfast,
Molly, your favourite.

23:09.726 --> 23:13.730
-No time, dear, I must pack.
-ARCHIE:
What do you mean, pack?

23:13.813 --> 23:15.732
I'm leaving.

23:15.815 --> 23:18.317
-ARCHIE: What? A holiday?
-No.

23:18.401 --> 23:19.861
Just leaving.

23:24.991 --> 23:26.367
I'll go.

23:31.998 --> 23:35.668
-Oh, give me a hand, Archie.
-You cannot just up and leave.

23:35.752 --> 23:40.131
-My mind is made up.
Don't try and stop me.
-Let's talk about it.

23:40.214 --> 23:43.426
I'll keep in touch, of course.
Let you know where I am.

23:43.509 --> 23:46.054
-I promise you,
he won't come here again.
-Who won't?

23:46.137 --> 23:49.098
-Paul. I'll get rid of him.
-Archie, please.

23:54.812 --> 23:57.065
-Badger?
-Yes?

23:57.148 --> 24:01.527
I claim this land in the name
of the Glenbogle estate.

24:01.611 --> 24:03.029
I see.

24:04.989 --> 24:10.203
Aye,
right, well, surrender now
and no one need get hurt.

24:10.286 --> 24:13.206
Technically,
it's not mine to surrender.

24:13.289 --> 24:16.918
Now, shall I pour us some tea,
whilst you think on that?

24:18.127 --> 24:22.131
-Aye, pour us some tea.
-Good Lord.

24:24.717 --> 24:28.554
-Tea with the enemy.
-He's just
following my orders.

24:29.806 --> 24:31.808
-Your orders?
-Aye.

24:31.891 --> 24:34.018
Maybe now you'll listen to
our demands.

24:34.102 --> 24:36.396
I'll be negotiating
with Archie.

24:36.479 --> 24:38.981
I only talk to
the organ grinder.

24:39.065 --> 24:40.483
Pompous ass.

24:42.902 --> 24:46.948
He had the sheer
effrontery to call me pompous.

24:48.282 --> 24:51.327
-Good Lord.
-I take it he'll
be disciplined.

24:51.411 --> 24:54.247
-It's out of my hands.
-He's in your employ.

24:54.330 --> 24:56.833
-No.
-Then what's he doing here?

24:59.168 --> 25:02.880
-He's my father's son.
-Well,
then he ought to know better.

25:03.756 --> 25:05.174
What?

25:05.258 --> 25:08.511
He's Hector's son,
he turned up
a couple of days ago.

25:08.594 --> 25:11.097
Good God.

25:11.180 --> 25:16.144
So you can see how your
waterworks aren't exactly top
of my agenda at the moment.

25:16.227 --> 25:20.773
Hector? Does Molly know?

25:20.857 --> 25:23.526
-Mmm-hmm.
-And?

25:25.319 --> 25:26.821
She's leaving.

25:31.284 --> 25:32.785
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

25:32.869 --> 25:36.622
We'd like to speak to
Sergeant Bowman please.
Paul Bowman.

25:38.416 --> 25:41.377
-He's left this as
a contact address.
-Aha.

25:41.461 --> 25:43.838
So, he's here?

25:43.921 --> 25:50.011
Yes, er, yes, he was. He
dropped in just to say hello,
but he's gone now.

25:55.391 --> 25:58.686
GOLLY: Is there something
you're not telling us, son?

26:00.271 --> 26:05.610
-Technically,
I should be in barracks.
-You mean you're AWOL?

26:05.693 --> 26:10.573
I had compassionate leave,
of course, when Mum was ill,
and for the funeral.

26:12.575 --> 26:13.951
So you haven't been back
since?

26:14.035 --> 26:17.538
There was a posting
waiting for me in Cyprus.

26:17.622 --> 26:21.292
But with Mum gone,
and the house and everything.

26:21.376 --> 26:24.796
I've done a lot of overseas
tours, but I've always had
somewhere to come back to.

26:24.879 --> 26:26.381
Somewhere I...

26:27.507 --> 26:29.926
You know, home.

26:33.721 --> 26:37.600
-Is there something we can do?
-I've caused
enough trouble already.

26:37.684 --> 26:42.397
-Time I was on my way.
-Is this
a court-martial job, son?

26:43.356 --> 26:45.233
Yeah.

26:45.316 --> 26:48.236
But if I'd found my father,
it would have been worth it.

26:48.319 --> 26:51.155
What about going back,
facing the music?

26:51.906 --> 26:54.534
I can't, not yet.

26:54.617 --> 26:58.287
It doesn't seem right, though,
just leaving with nothing.

26:58.371 --> 27:02.000
I've seen the place. You all.

27:04.460 --> 27:07.171
It's better than nothing.

27:07.255 --> 27:10.174
Come on, son. Come on.

27:10.258 --> 27:12.176
I'll give you
a lift to the station.

27:22.478 --> 27:25.773
I've told Archie
and Lexie, of course,

27:25.857 --> 27:28.609
but I wanted you
to know from me,
not second-hand.

27:28.693 --> 27:31.612
But where will you go?
How will you live?

27:31.696 --> 27:34.991
There are one or two
minor details to hammer out.

27:37.493 --> 27:39.704
You know, I have friends and
contacts all over the world.

27:39.787 --> 27:41.664
I could put you in touch with
them.

27:41.748 --> 27:44.292
You'd be
guaranteed a warm welcome.

27:45.376 --> 27:46.627
Thank you.

27:48.212 --> 27:52.216
Or, I could come with you.

27:52.300 --> 27:54.427
As a friend, nothing else.

27:54.510 --> 28:00.933
I wouldn't dream to dragging
you away. Your cottage,
you're so happy here.

28:01.017 --> 28:04.645
Bricks and mortar, Molly,
that's not where the heart is.

28:11.069 --> 28:14.280
-I hope I
haven't offended you.
-Not at all.

28:14.364 --> 28:16.407
It's a very kind offer.

28:18.409 --> 28:20.787
And I shall give
it some thought.

28:26.292 --> 28:29.879
It's been a shock,
son, for Archie.

28:29.962 --> 28:31.964
It'll take him a wee while
to get used to it.

28:32.048 --> 28:35.426
It's been a shock for me, too.

28:35.510 --> 28:39.430
But it's more
than that with him.

28:39.514 --> 28:43.726
He looks at me and
he sees something
he can't handle.

28:43.810 --> 28:45.812
I don't know what it is.

28:55.405 --> 28:58.700
They'll be
watching the station.

28:58.783 --> 29:03.663
I'll take you back, wait until
nightfall and then you
can get past them.

29:03.746 --> 29:06.958
Golly, I've got you in
enough trouble as it is.

29:20.930 --> 29:24.559
-But Archie? Lexie?
-Oh, they'll be fine.

29:25.643 --> 29:27.645
Well, me, then?

29:27.729 --> 29:30.815
Your friendship
means a great deal
to me, Kilwillie,

29:30.898 --> 29:36.029
but the day has come for me
to break
the bonds of Glenbogle.

29:36.112 --> 29:41.576
Archie did tell me a bit
about the circumstances.
Hector?

29:41.659 --> 29:45.872
-It came as a bit of a shock.
-So Hector never
confided in you?

29:45.955 --> 29:48.249
No, he didn't.

29:48.332 --> 29:51.085
Just in Golly apparently.

29:51.169 --> 29:54.505
-Golly knew?
-According to Archie.

29:54.589 --> 29:57.884
-And he said nothing.
-I beg you to reconsider.

29:57.967 --> 30:01.846
This is a time when you should
be among your friends, Molly,
not all alone in the world.

30:01.929 --> 30:05.516
I won't be all alone.
Andrew's offered
to come with me.

30:10.438 --> 30:13.524
He's on the run from the army,
he's put Kilwillie's back up,

30:13.608 --> 30:17.153
he's turned Golly against me.
How can you defend him?

30:17.236 --> 30:22.408
Because he's your own flesh
and blood, Archie, he's risked
everything to come here.

30:22.492 --> 30:27.455
-Yes, to cause trouble.
-To find out a little
bit about your father.

30:27.538 --> 30:33.211
A few scraps, other people's
memories. It means a lot,
Arch, believe me.

30:36.422 --> 30:39.842
He'll be gone by nightfall.
Go and see him, eh?

30:55.525 --> 30:58.653
You knew. You said nothing.

30:58.736 --> 31:01.030
-I though it was the
right thing to do.
-For whom?

31:01.114 --> 31:04.242
I've carried this for 30 years
and I would gladly
carry it for 30 more

31:04.325 --> 31:07.328
-to protect what I hold dear.
-What?

31:07.412 --> 31:10.373
-Hector's reputation?
-No, your family.

31:12.166 --> 31:14.210
-I'm leaving.
-Are you?

31:15.169 --> 31:17.296
You did that once before.

31:19.716 --> 31:21.259
How dare you?

31:25.263 --> 31:29.642
You know nothing about
what happened that day,
nothing at all, or why I left.

31:29.726 --> 31:32.979
I was 19.
I came back, didn't I?

31:33.062 --> 31:35.940
Oh, by then Megan
was already
carrying Hector's child.

31:36.024 --> 31:38.818
And so was I.
You can't blame me for that.

31:38.901 --> 31:42.864
I don't. But I don't
blame Hector either.

31:42.947 --> 31:48.453
Listen,
Molly, it is too late for him
to ask your forgiveness,

31:48.536 --> 31:52.123
but it is not too
late for you to grant it.

32:08.389 --> 32:10.767
You worked for Archie long?

32:10.850 --> 32:14.020
-Born into it.
-Part of the furniture, eh?

32:15.605 --> 32:16.731
Aye.

32:17.523 --> 32:20.735
What is his problem?

32:20.818 --> 32:25.782
It's not really his fault.
He's got a lot to put up with,
being the laird and all.

32:25.865 --> 32:29.744
It can't be easy,
doing that all on your own.

32:29.827 --> 32:32.997
-He lost a brother, didn't he?
-Jamie, aye.

32:33.081 --> 32:35.291
Drowned trying to
save the family Labrador.

32:35.375 --> 32:39.087
Archie was there mind,
but nothing he could do.

33:09.534 --> 33:12.870
He loved this view,
he loved my mother.

33:14.789 --> 33:18.918
He was an average fisherman,
a rather poor golfer.

33:21.504 --> 33:24.924
He loved his dogs, the hills,

33:27.218 --> 33:30.388
loved his malt,
especially that.

33:33.474 --> 33:37.395
He fought in Korea,
he was stubborn.

33:38.855 --> 33:40.523
Sometimes stupid.

33:41.858 --> 33:43.943
He often talked too much.

33:45.903 --> 33:47.822
Sometimes not enough.

33:50.366 --> 33:52.785
And we thought
the world of him.

33:56.414 --> 33:58.082
Thank you, Archie.

34:03.421 --> 34:06.174
Duncan told me what
happened to Jamie.

34:08.009 --> 34:10.053
I'm really sorry for you.

34:12.388 --> 34:14.223
I want you to go now.

34:37.705 --> 34:40.500
ANDREW: Golly?

34:40.583 --> 34:43.795
I was looking for Kilwillie.
Said he was
coming up to see you.

34:43.878 --> 34:44.920
Did he?

34:47.172 --> 34:48.632
Something wrong?

34:48.716 --> 34:53.679
You've not heard then,
that Molly's
intent upon leaving?

34:53.763 --> 34:58.226
-Is that a bad thing?
-I'd like to know
who's been encouraging her.

34:59.811 --> 35:03.022
-Well,
perhaps she needs a break.
-No.

35:03.106 --> 35:05.983
No, she needs to
stay and face things.

35:06.067 --> 35:09.112
If she runs now,
she'll be running forever.

35:11.489 --> 35:14.200
-Maybe you're right.
-I am right.

35:27.171 --> 35:30.591
The man has taken
leave of his senses.

35:30.675 --> 35:34.761
If we let him finish it,
you can kiss
goodbye to your water.

35:34.846 --> 35:38.390
It's okay, we'll deal with it.

35:38.474 --> 35:41.978
You don't have
to get involved.

35:42.060 --> 35:44.646
Since I'm here,
it's the least I can do.

35:44.731 --> 35:48.693
-Yeah, and I have a plan.
-Good, Duncan.

35:50.861 --> 35:55.450
I'll create a diversion, lead
these three on a merry dance
through the woods,

35:55.533 --> 35:58.494
and you two take
down the fence.

35:58.578 --> 36:00.580
Will they not just
put it back up again?

36:00.663 --> 36:03.249
Yes, but sometimes you
have to show the enemy

36:03.332 --> 36:06.585
you can be as
bloody-minded as they are.

36:06.669 --> 36:09.756
Drag them to
the negotiating table.

36:09.839 --> 36:14.093
-Right, Duncan?
-That was my thinking exactly.

36:14.177 --> 36:16.721
Okay,
Duncan, let's go with it.

36:32.987 --> 36:34.822
Here Duncan

36:39.744 --> 36:43.539
Come on, lads,
I haven't even started yet.

36:44.248 --> 36:45.625
MAN: Come on.

36:48.586 --> 36:50.463
We have got our diversion.

36:51.589 --> 36:53.049
Let's get on with our job.

36:59.806 --> 37:01.015
Badger?

37:02.600 --> 37:04.686
What brings you here?

37:04.769 --> 37:07.939
Just trying to walk off
the effects of
Golly's cooking.

37:08.022 --> 37:14.070
-Good lunch, was it?
-Venison,
potatoes, fresh vegetables.

37:14.153 --> 37:18.574
-What was that sauce, Golly?
-It was red wine,
mustard and wild thyme.

37:18.658 --> 37:23.371
-That must have been grand.
-It still is.
We couldn't finish it.

37:23.454 --> 37:26.833
We were wondering maybe
if you could
help us out there.

37:26.916 --> 37:29.168
Well, what about my duties?

37:29.252 --> 37:33.256
Ach, well, there are times,
Badger, when duty
betrays common sense,

37:33.339 --> 37:38.761
and we foot soldiers, as it
were, should unite to put
an end to this madness.

37:39.971 --> 37:42.223
Aye, aye.

37:42.306 --> 37:45.601
We're lions led by
donkeys right enough.

37:47.437 --> 37:51.566
-I'd be happy to
take lunch with you.
-Excellent.

37:54.235 --> 37:57.196
This way, Badger.

37:57.280 --> 38:00.533
-Look after our guest, Golly.
-My pleasure, Paul.

38:08.791 --> 38:10.501
(BADGER EXCLAIMING)

38:13.338 --> 38:19.302
I'm sorry Badger, I hope you
don't mind, but seeing as how
they've captured Duncan...

38:19.385 --> 38:24.599
I'd rather be a prisoner of a
gentleman than a free man in
a world gone mad.

38:26.851 --> 38:31.481
This water business is a
farce. You've let it get
completely out of control.

38:31.564 --> 38:35.943
Kilwillie's entitled
to protect what's his.
Anyway, he didn't start it.

38:36.027 --> 38:40.615
-Paul did.
-All his fault, as per usual.

38:40.698 --> 38:44.744
-Give him a break, Arch.
-He's upset everyone.
He's upset Mother.

38:44.827 --> 38:47.580
You can't blame him,
it's not his fault.

38:49.290 --> 38:51.959
-Where are you going?
-There's
something I have to do.

38:52.043 --> 38:54.837
-Send Duncan.
-I can't.

38:57.757 --> 39:01.177
I think he was
finally beginning
to believe he could do it.

39:01.260 --> 39:03.221
You know, be the laird.

39:04.138 --> 39:08.726
Molly, don't go, please.

39:12.563 --> 39:15.316
Are we ready for
the exchange of prisoners?

39:15.400 --> 39:19.362
-That we are, your Lordship.
-Good. Send Badger over.

39:20.863 --> 39:25.076
Not on your life.
You give us Duncan first.

39:25.159 --> 39:27.370
This is my land,
send over Badger.

39:27.453 --> 39:30.790
I don't care.
You give us Duncan and
we'll give you Badger.

39:30.873 --> 39:32.166
-Badger.
-Duncan.

39:32.250 --> 39:33.376
-Badger.
-Duncan.

39:33.459 --> 39:36.796
Right, now let me through.

39:36.879 --> 39:39.549
KILWILLIE: Now,
Lexie, this is men's talk.

39:39.632 --> 39:46.180
Out of your backsides as
usual. Now, do you expect
Golly to live without water?

39:46.264 --> 39:48.683
Well, it's
a precious commercial asset.

39:48.766 --> 39:51.269
And you really think that
Golly's needs will make a

39:51.352 --> 39:54.147
scrap of difference to your
business?

39:54.230 --> 39:57.567
-This is
a matter of principle.
-Principle?

39:57.650 --> 40:01.362
Listen, there are
people hurting round here.

40:01.446 --> 40:04.198
Archie and Paul over there.

40:04.282 --> 40:08.119
And what about Molly,
too, Kilwillie?
Don't forget about her.

40:08.202 --> 40:11.539
And you are
standing here bickering
over a matter of principle.

40:11.622 --> 40:15.376
Over a small amount of water.

40:15.460 --> 40:18.963
Don't you know that there's
more to life than that?

40:19.047 --> 40:20.423
Hear, hear.

40:27.055 --> 40:29.474
Well,
I'm a reasonable man, Lexie.

40:29.557 --> 40:33.227
-If you've got a suggestion,
I'll listen to it.
-Thank you.

40:33.311 --> 40:36.272
Now, we can start by
taking care of our friends.

40:36.356 --> 40:39.901
I have a plan which involves
you all, and which, by the

40:39.984 --> 40:43.196
way, gentlemen, is not
optional.

40:44.197 --> 40:45.406
Come on.

40:57.210 --> 40:58.670
Well?

40:58.753 --> 41:03.383
Well, the thing is, Archie,
I've been a damn fool.

41:06.386 --> 41:08.429
You were only trying
to protect your own.

41:08.513 --> 41:13.351
If it's at the expense
of one's friendships,
then it's a very poor show.

41:13.434 --> 41:17.063
Golly will have his water
at an annual peppercorn rent.

41:18.439 --> 41:20.650
That's very generous of you.

41:20.733 --> 41:24.153
And didn't you have something
else in mind, Kilwillie, as a
sort of goodwill gesture?

41:24.237 --> 41:26.739
Oh, all right.

41:26.823 --> 41:29.200
Golly can take advantage of my
offer much sooner if he has

41:29.283 --> 41:31.536
some assistance with the
building work.

41:31.619 --> 41:35.081
And what did you have in mind?

41:35.164 --> 41:39.335
I should like to
place my estate workers
at his disposal today.

41:39.419 --> 41:42.380
Many hands,
as we know, make light work.

41:42.463 --> 41:45.883
-He'll be very grateful.
-We can help, too, Arch.

41:45.967 --> 41:48.636
No, no, I won't go to
Golly's house. You know why.

41:48.720 --> 41:54.392
-Well, I know why you should.
-Because he's your
gillie and you're his boss.

41:54.475 --> 41:58.771
Okay, so I'll go and round up
some helpers but the laird
should be there, too.

41:58.855 --> 42:01.524
As you said,
Glenbogle does come first.

42:07.655 --> 42:09.282
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

42:09.365 --> 42:10.616
Come in.

42:11.451 --> 42:12.910
Here you go.

42:14.829 --> 42:19.584
-Not too much, is there?
-You tell me, Molly.

42:24.839 --> 42:28.134
You've unfinished business
here, and you know it.

42:31.262 --> 42:33.389
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

42:33.473 --> 42:35.016
What's going on?

42:47.904 --> 42:49.781
Quite a turn out.

42:49.864 --> 42:54.410
-It'll be a good time
to say goodbye, at least.
-No.

42:55.912 --> 42:59.499
Pack a bag and slip
out the back door?

42:59.582 --> 43:03.127
That may be my style, Molly,
it certainly isn't yours.

43:07.090 --> 43:11.260
Put your backs into it, lads,
Lord Kilwillie's orders.

43:11.344 --> 43:14.806
BADGER: He'll be back at
headquarters, I suppose?

43:14.889 --> 43:17.100
Messed up, didn't I?

43:17.183 --> 43:20.853
Good old Dunc, can't
even create a diversion.

43:32.323 --> 43:36.035
-Duncan.
-DUNCAN: Ah, here we go again.

43:36.119 --> 43:38.830
GOLLY: Better see
what the man wants.

43:40.081 --> 43:41.374
Boss.

43:44.752 --> 43:46.254
Hey, Big Eric.

43:49.298 --> 43:53.136
-We'll not see his like
round here for a while.
-No.

43:53.219 --> 43:54.887
Read it.

44:05.606 --> 44:08.484
They're yours,
Dunc, you did a good job.

44:11.320 --> 44:14.699
-There's beer and food for
everyone here. All right.
-Hi, Archie.

44:22.040 --> 44:26.044
-So, what can I do?
-You can give me
a hand with this, I suppose.

44:35.762 --> 44:38.264
-Where do you want it?
-Up there.

44:39.057 --> 44:40.808
Ready when you are.

45:02.580 --> 45:04.540
Goodbyes are hard.

45:08.503 --> 45:11.798
MOLLY: That's Hector's son
down there with Archie.

45:14.342 --> 45:16.052
His son not mine.

45:19.806 --> 45:23.267
-Are you
surprised I want to leave?
-No.

45:24.644 --> 45:27.105
But I'll be
surprised if you do.

45:28.439 --> 45:30.733
I don't think you'll run away.

45:38.533 --> 45:40.034
You're right.

45:43.579 --> 45:45.456
Shall we join them?

45:48.501 --> 45:50.670
I'll go and unpack first.

46:07.478 --> 46:11.899
It's fortunate that neither
of you inherited your
father's DIY skills.

46:14.360 --> 46:16.612
-Useless?
-GOLLY: He'll be back.

46:27.790 --> 46:32.712
Look, Golly, I'm sorry, I had
no right to talk to you
the way that I did.

46:32.795 --> 46:38.968
Ach, this has been
a lot tougher for you
than most people imagine.

46:44.515 --> 46:46.642
It was like he'd come back,

46:48.853 --> 46:51.898
but it wasn't him,
could never be.

46:51.981 --> 46:55.735
Archie, Archie,
you were a child then.

46:57.362 --> 46:59.238
Stop blaming yourself.

47:00.907 --> 47:04.202
Jamie would have
been a fine laird,

47:04.285 --> 47:08.289
but he couldn't have done more
or better than you.

47:11.084 --> 47:13.336
Don't look back any more, son.

47:14.671 --> 47:17.048
Perhaps I should talk to Paul.

47:19.467 --> 47:21.928
I can't tell you
how to feel but,

47:22.929 --> 47:24.806
if I'd lost a brother,

47:26.516 --> 47:29.102
I'd be in no mind
to lose another.

47:52.458 --> 47:54.252
(USELESS WHINING)

48:04.012 --> 48:06.264
Get away from the edge,
Paul, come on.

48:06.347 --> 48:08.224
Useless is stuck, poor lad.

48:08.307 --> 48:11.728
-He'll make his own way back.
-No, he won't. Come on.

48:15.606 --> 48:18.151
Here. Come on, Useless.

48:24.198 --> 48:26.200
-Got him?
-Yep.

48:26.284 --> 48:28.661
Here, give me your hand.
Come on.

48:29.704 --> 48:30.830
Paul!

48:45.636 --> 48:47.180
There's Archie.

48:53.811 --> 48:55.104
Archie!

49:23.549 --> 49:25.885
Where are they?
Where are they?

49:27.428 --> 49:29.514
What's going on?

49:30.807 --> 49:32.392
What's going on?

49:33.976 --> 49:35.687
I can't see them.

49:36.479 --> 49:38.147
I can't see them.

49:43.194 --> 49:44.404
Archie!

49:45.613 --> 49:46.823
Archie!

49:51.452 --> 49:53.204
Don't worry, Arch.

49:53.287 --> 49:55.206
-Have you got him, Golly?
-I've got him.

49:55.289 --> 49:56.874
Get him on his feet.

49:56.958 --> 49:59.252
-I got him.
-You all right, Arch?

49:59.335 --> 50:01.713
-Come on.
-Get him out.

50:02.839 --> 50:03.923
Come on.

50:04.007 --> 50:05.341
Well done.

50:06.050 --> 50:07.427
Archie.

50:24.027 --> 50:26.696
-Okay?
-Yeah.

50:29.949 --> 50:31.367
Welcome back.

50:36.748 --> 50:39.375
You shouldn't be
drinking beer, young lady.

50:39.459 --> 50:43.171
-And why not?
-Because you know
what it does to you.

50:43.254 --> 50:46.049
You, Golly,
know far too much about me.

50:47.925 --> 50:52.347
Listen,
Molly, I really am sorry
that I kept it from you.

51:00.646 --> 51:02.565
Mrs MacDonald, I wanted
to apologise...

51:02.648 --> 51:05.443
No, please,
there's really no need.

51:05.526 --> 51:08.279
So, you'll be
staying for a while?

51:08.363 --> 51:12.575
No, I'm gonna go
back to my regiment.

51:12.658 --> 51:16.829
Well, then, you must
visit us whenever you can.

51:16.913 --> 51:19.707
Your father loved this place,
his heart was here.

51:25.004 --> 51:26.422
Thank you.

51:29.092 --> 51:33.930
So,
it looks like I'll have you
under my feet after all.

51:34.013 --> 51:36.432
You know, Glenbogle wouldn't
be the same
without you, Mother.

51:36.516 --> 51:39.352
And it wouldn't be
the success it is
without you, Archie.

51:39.435 --> 51:43.022
You've done it, you've
turned this place around.

51:43.106 --> 51:45.483
With a little help.

51:45.566 --> 51:49.821
So, you two, is the honeymoon
back on the agenda?

51:49.904 --> 51:52.824
-No, I don't think we can...
-Well,
Mother's not going anywhere.

51:52.907 --> 51:54.742
Golly and Duncan can look
after the place.

51:54.826 --> 51:56.619
I'm sure
you'll keep a neighbourly
eye out.

51:56.703 --> 51:58.579
So, what's to stop us?

52:02.834 --> 52:06.045
Oh, Kilwillie. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

52:07.630 --> 52:10.591
Come on, come on,
don't keep the man waiting.

52:10.675 --> 52:14.470
We're coming, we're coming!
Sorry.
Have you got the tickets?

52:14.554 --> 52:16.806
Yes,
yes, they're here, come on.
