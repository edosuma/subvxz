00:10.768 --> 00:13.837
<i>Types of people in the world--
the non-worriers...</i>

00:13.871 --> 00:16.405
God, chill! I'll study while
they're handing out the test.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.908
The nail was a little rusty,
but I threw some beer on there,

00:18.942 --> 00:20.762
<i>Cleaned it right out.
And the worriers.</i>

00:20.797 --> 00:22.242
What if I never get
my braces off?

00:22.276 --> 00:24.907
What if I'm part of some secret
experiment where they're trying

00:24.942 --> 00:27.412
To see how long a person can
last with braces on their teeth?

00:27.447 --> 00:30.411
<i>I'm forgetting things, Mike.
My keys were right here!</i>

00:30.445 --> 00:33.409
This runs in families.
It's only a matter of time

00:33.444 --> 00:35.908
Before I am wandering
the interstate in my bathrobe,

00:35.943 --> 00:38.537
And you're using candy
to get me in the car.

00:38.571 --> 00:40.533
I stole a customer from Pete.

00:40.567 --> 00:43.095
I'm a dead man!
Dead, dead, dead!

00:43.129 --> 00:46.225
<i>You stole
a sale from Pete in real life,</i>

00:46.259 --> 00:49.223
Not that dream you have? Yes! This guy he'd
been working with came in on Pete's day off,

00:49.257 --> 00:51.688
And I told him that Pete
had been shot by a cop,

00:51.722 --> 00:53.520
And I closed the sale.
That must've been a rush.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.553
I felt like a God!
Ladies...

00:55.587 --> 00:58.050
Oh!
Always funny, Pete.

00:58.084 --> 00:59.517
He knows!

00:59.551 --> 01:01.517
If he goes for my face,

01:01.551 --> 01:03.517
Don't let 'em rebuild it
with that putty.

01:03.551 --> 01:05.016
It never looks natural.

01:05.050 --> 01:07.783
<i>Frankie,
you have a call on line 1.</i>

01:07.817 --> 01:10.648
<i>Axl can't find his jeans.
Says it's your fault.</i>

01:10.683 --> 01:13.116
<i>You were supposed to wash them.</i>

01:13.150 --> 01:15.717
<i>Why are you trying to ruin
his life?</i>

01:15.751 --> 01:18.217
Tell him to look
in the basket on the--

01:18.251 --> 01:20.219
<i>Never mind. He found 'em.</i>

01:20.253 --> 01:22.220
Hey, how is Axl doing?

01:22.255 --> 01:24.819
Is he still dating that cheerleader girl?
No, thank God.

01:24.853 --> 01:26.678
<i>Tthe past few months</i>

01:26.712 --> 01:29.509
<i>Had been a roller coaster
of pain.</i>

01:29.543 --> 01:31.007
<i>Axl's first love, Morgan,</i>

01:31.041 --> 01:33.142
<i>Had broken up with him,
leaving him heartbroken.</i>

01:33.176 --> 01:36.009
<i>And then just when he'd finally bounced
back...Morgan and I are back together!</i>

01:36.044 --> 01:37.310
She broke up with me.

01:37.344 --> 01:38.577
She loves me!

01:38.611 --> 01:40.211
She loves me too much.

01:40.245 --> 01:43.546
She's willing to take me back
if I can change. I think I can.

01:43.581 --> 01:46.014
She doesn't like the person
that I've become...

01:46.048 --> 01:48.515
So I totally broke up with her.

01:48.550 --> 01:51.450
No matter what anyone tells you,
it was me, my decision,

01:51.484 --> 01:53.417
And I feel so good about it.

01:59.421 --> 02:01.588
Anyway, I'm just glad
it's finally over.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.556
I have had it with her.

02:03.590 --> 02:06.258
You don't know what it's like
to watch your kid get hurt

02:06.292 --> 02:09.626
Again and again and again.
That's why I never dated in High School.

02:09.660 --> 02:12.594
S-spare my mom the pain.

02:12.629 --> 02:14.796
Gather 'round, minions.

02:14.830 --> 02:17.364
I'm throwing a company picnic--

02:17.398 --> 02:19.833
Food, drinks, games,
the whole shebang--

02:19.867 --> 02:23.601
And I expect to see every one
of you there with your families.

02:25.970 --> 02:27.937
It's really
my granddaughter's 9th birthday,

02:27.972 --> 02:30.839
But this way I can write
the whole thing off.

02:30.874 --> 02:33.107
She likes
those American girl dolls.

02:33.141 --> 02:35.575
Check with each other
so you don't double up.

02:40.413 --> 02:43.347
Remember how I told you
we're hatching eggs at school

02:43.381 --> 02:44.848
For a science project?

02:44.882 --> 02:46.382
Let's say I do.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.250
This little guy is the only one
who didn't hatch.

02:49.284 --> 02:50.951
Hatch.

02:50.985 --> 02:53.720
Brick, there's probably a reason it didn't hatch.
 I know.

02:53.754 --> 02:56.521
He's anxious
about what he's getting into.

02:56.556 --> 02:59.223
That's why I'm gonna spend
as long as it takes

02:59.257 --> 03:02.125
To reassure him that the world
is a safe, loving place.

03:02.159 --> 03:03.559
Meet scout.

03:03.594 --> 03:05.027
Oh, hey there, scout.

03:05.061 --> 03:07.895
When it starts to smell,
throw it in the trash.

03:07.930 --> 03:09.363
<i>To our great surprise,</i>

03:09.397 --> 03:11.865
<i>Brick actually took better care
of that egg than...</i>

03:11.899 --> 03:14.333
<i>Well, just about anything
I can think of.</i>

03:14.401 --> 03:16.134
<i>He took it with him everywhere.</i>

03:22.540 --> 03:23.973
<i>But Brick being Brick...</i>

03:24.008 --> 03:25.975
Hey, what are you doing?

03:26.009 --> 03:27.676
I lost scout.

03:27.711 --> 03:29.611
Brick.

03:29.645 --> 03:31.613
I know it was inevitable,

03:31.647 --> 03:33.547
But I'm still disappointed
in me.

03:33.582 --> 03:35.949
I don't know what happened.

03:35.983 --> 03:39.085
I had him with me, and then I didn't.
Just relax. It's gonna be okay.

03:39.119 --> 03:41.620
We'll find your egg.
I already looked everywhere.

03:41.654 --> 03:43.988
<i>You've looked everywhere,
but have you smelled everywhere?</i>

03:44.022 --> 03:45.956
Start sniffing.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.093
Ugh.

03:51.128 --> 03:53.862
Who even drinks buttermilk?

03:55.398 --> 03:57.331
Mom, something stinks
over here.

03:59.334 --> 04:01.301
Oh, false alarm.
Axl's tennis shoes.

04:01.335 --> 04:02.802
Ohh.

04:02.836 --> 04:04.770
Ew. Keep sniffing.

04:06.473 --> 04:10.274
What is going on with your feet
that your shoes smell like this?

04:10.309 --> 04:12.476
Awesome! You found 'em.

04:12.510 --> 04:13.977
Ugh.

04:14.011 --> 04:16.413
Going to Sean's.
Don't wait up.

04:16.447 --> 04:18.548
Here, scout.

04:18.582 --> 04:20.583
Here, boy.

04:20.617 --> 04:22.953
I'm hoping for a boy.

04:22.988 --> 04:24.454
Uh-huh.

04:24.489 --> 04:26.923
Is this Axl's calculus book?

04:26.957 --> 04:29.091
Yeah, right.

04:30.627 --> 04:33.061
Oh, Sue,
I found your lip gloss.

04:33.095 --> 04:34.562
Oh, cool.

04:34.597 --> 04:37.065
Oh, wait.
This isn't mine.

04:37.099 --> 04:39.567
I only use lip smacker's
orange pop flavor,

04:39.601 --> 04:41.402
Same as Brad.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.775
<i>The calculus book,
the lip gloss--</i>

04:47.809 --> 04:50.778
<i>It was all adding up
to one thing.</i>

04:50.812 --> 04:54.048
<i>Either Axl had turned into
a gay math whiz...</i>

04:54.082 --> 04:56.383
<i>Or Morgan was back.</i>

05:04.784 --> 05:06.718
Mike, you're not
gonna believe this.

05:06.752 --> 05:09.654
Are you ready? Guess who Axl
is apparently seeing again.

05:09.688 --> 05:12.255
Don't guess! I'll tell you.
Morgan.

05:14.290 --> 05:17.323
Are you speechless
or just not paying attention?

05:17.357 --> 05:19.525
I already knew.

05:19.559 --> 05:20.993
What?

05:21.027 --> 05:23.963
You caught them together,
and you didn't tell me?

05:23.997 --> 05:25.297
No.

05:25.332 --> 05:28.200
You overheard them on the phone,
and you didn't tell me.

05:28.234 --> 05:31.136
No. Axl told me,
and I didn't tell you.

05:31.171 --> 05:35.341
What? What?! Why?
Why didn't you tell me?

05:35.375 --> 05:39.211
Frankie, I didn't tell you,
because he asked me not to.

05:39.245 --> 05:42.181
He didn't think
you would take it well.

05:42.215 --> 05:45.284
That doesn't even make sense.
Why would he think that?

05:45.318 --> 05:47.219
And I'll tell you
another thing about Morgan--

05:47.253 --> 05:49.054
She is just
stringing you along!

05:49.088 --> 05:51.022
I mean, she seems
all nice and sweet,

05:51.057 --> 05:53.024
But if she really cared
about you,

05:53.059 --> 05:54.993
She would not be
jerkin' you around like this,

05:55.027 --> 05:56.494
And if you can't see that...

05:56.528 --> 05:57.962
Oh, my God.

05:57.996 --> 06:00.398
So Axl feels
like he can't come to me?

06:00.432 --> 06:02.366
But he'll go to you,

06:02.400 --> 06:05.302
Whose greatest pearls of wisdom
are "shake it off" and "man up."

06:05.337 --> 06:07.538
Apparently.

06:07.572 --> 06:09.406
Well, this sucks.

06:09.441 --> 06:11.575
Aw. Shake it off.

06:11.609 --> 06:14.545
Mom, dad, I found my egg.

06:14.579 --> 06:17.648
Ohh. Well, you gave it
your best shot.

06:17.682 --> 06:19.616
Circle of life and all that.

06:19.651 --> 06:22.652
No, no. It hatched!
Isn't it great?

06:22.687 --> 06:24.588
I don't know where he is,

06:24.622 --> 06:27.057
But we have a baby chicken
in the house.

06:27.091 --> 06:29.860
Chicken in the house.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.074

06:44.108 --> 06:46.576
Hi, Axl. How was Sean's?

06:46.610 --> 06:48.711
Fine.

06:48.746 --> 06:50.646
Wait.
Where are you going?

06:50.681 --> 06:53.549
I was hoping we could talk.

06:53.583 --> 06:55.184
Why?

06:55.218 --> 06:58.087
I don't know.
I just miss ya.

06:58.121 --> 07:00.122
Come on. Sit.
It'll be fun.

07:06.397 --> 07:09.199
So what do you want
to talk about?

07:09.233 --> 07:12.336
I don't.
You made me sit here.

07:12.370 --> 07:13.737
Okay, I'll start.

07:13.771 --> 07:16.173
Axl, we've always had
the kind of relationship

07:16.208 --> 07:19.010
Where you can tell me
anything, right?

07:19.044 --> 07:20.444
<i>No.</i>

07:20.479 --> 07:22.880
Yes, we have,
and I would feel so sad

07:22.915 --> 07:25.317
If you felt that
you couldn't tell me something

07:25.351 --> 07:28.153
Or that you had to hide
something,

07:28.188 --> 07:30.489
Because you were worried
about how I would react,

07:30.523 --> 07:32.491
<i>Because I'm good at listening--
very good.</i>

07:32.525 --> 07:35.360
Better than dad, really.
Mom, I didn't tell you I'm back with Morgan,

07:35.395 --> 07:38.464
'cause I knew you'd flip out.
You're back with Morgan?

07:38.498 --> 07:41.700
Mom, please. Look, I know
you hate her, but I love her,

07:41.734 --> 07:44.604
So could we just drop it?
I don't hate Morgan.

07:44.638 --> 07:47.039
I hated
the way she treated you,

07:47.074 --> 07:48.808
But if you're happy, I'm happy.

07:48.842 --> 07:51.978
Mom, I lie to you. You don't lie
to me. That's the way it works.

07:52.012 --> 07:53.947
Let me prove it to you.

07:53.981 --> 07:56.883
Why don't you bring her
to dinner tomorrow night?

07:56.918 --> 07:59.619
Wow, mom,
that sounds... Awesome.

07:59.654 --> 08:02.589
Come on. Don't you want the two
women in your life to get along?

08:02.624 --> 08:04.058
Oh, my God.

08:04.092 --> 08:08.028
It sounds totally creepy when
you put it like that.

08:10.666 --> 08:12.600
I cannot believe
the head cheerleader

08:12.634 --> 08:14.568
And vice president
of student council

08:14.603 --> 08:17.071
Is coming to our house
for dinner.

08:17.105 --> 08:19.039
I have, like,
a million questions

08:19.073 --> 08:21.040
I want to ask her.

08:21.074 --> 08:23.975
This could be a real turning point in my life.
Okay, I agreed to dinner,

08:24.009 --> 08:26.441
But I never said anything
about Sue being here.

08:26.476 --> 08:29.377
Can't we just tie her to a tree in the backyard
or something? Axl, shake it off. Man up.

08:29.412 --> 08:32.347
Your mom invited Morgan over
so we can all get to know her.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.349
It's not a big deal.

08:34.383 --> 08:37.284
Just a really bad idea.
Mike, don't be ridiculous.

08:37.318 --> 08:40.254
It's a great idea.
It's gonna be great. Mm.

08:43.258 --> 08:45.692
<i>And I really believed
it was gonna be great.</i>

08:45.727 --> 08:48.261
<i>If Axl loved her,
I could love her.</i>

08:48.296 --> 08:50.164
<i>Simple as that.</i>

08:50.198 --> 08:51.865
Hi.

08:51.900 --> 08:54.268
<i>Oh, this is going to be hard.</i>

08:54.302 --> 08:56.903
Hey, Morgan. Come on in.

08:56.937 --> 09:01.239
Mrs. Heck, I know Axl and I
have had our ups and downs,

09:01.273 --> 09:03.673
But he has made
a lot of great changes,

09:03.707 --> 09:05.974
And I am feeling
really positive

09:06.009 --> 09:07.309
About our relationship
right now.

09:07.343 --> 09:10.079
Me, too. Super positive.

09:10.114 --> 09:12.049
Well, come on in.
Let's eat.

09:15.857 --> 09:18.192
I don't know
what kind you like,

09:18.226 --> 09:20.161
So I got regular
and extra-crispy.

09:20.195 --> 09:23.964
Wow. It's hard to decide. Sure.
It can be hard to make a choice and then stick with it.

09:23.999 --> 09:27.267
I get that. What? I said, "I get that."

09:27.302 --> 09:29.069
Is that a chicken?

09:29.104 --> 09:31.004
Oh, sorry.
That's Brick's chick.

09:31.039 --> 09:33.273
It's running around
the house somewhere.

09:33.308 --> 09:36.643
We can't FD it. He's right here.
I found him this morning.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.479
Brick, get that thing
off the table. Come on.

09:39.513 --> 09:43.450
Look, he imprinted on me.
He follows me everywhere.

09:43.484 --> 09:46.219
Come on.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.187
See?

09:48.222 --> 09:49.989
Okay.

09:50.024 --> 09:52.425
Well, I had a worst-case
scenario in my head,

09:52.459 --> 09:55.395
And this seems to be
kind of exceeding that,

09:55.429 --> 09:58.130
So we're gonna go. No.
This is all about us getting to know Morgan.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.566
So, Morgan, how's school going?

10:00.601 --> 10:03.770
Fantastic. I just aced
my a.P. Mandarin test.

10:03.804 --> 10:07.907
<i>I told Axl to drop Spanish, so now
he's taking it, too. Ni hao.</i>

10:07.941 --> 10:10.376
Oh. I didn't know
you dropped a class.

10:10.410 --> 10:13.179
So what's wrong with Spanish?

10:13.213 --> 10:15.147
Well-- nothing.
It's just everyone knows

10:15.181 --> 10:17.616
Chinese is the language of the future.
Uh-huh.

10:17.651 --> 10:21.153
Huh. Wow. I didn't know that.
Did you know that, Mike? Yep.

10:21.187 --> 10:23.722
It also looks good
on your transcript.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.758
I told Axl he needed to start
thinking about things like that.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.761
It's not exactly like we never
talk about that around here.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.497
I mean, we didn't
just give birth to him

10:32.531 --> 10:35.166
And then walk away.
Well, I told Axl...

10:35.201 --> 10:38.870
<i>So it went for the next 20 minutes. I told
Axl he should ask for a raise at the theater.</i>

10:38.904 --> 10:41.105
I told Axl he should get
those brakes fixed.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.275
I told Axl
he should wear more shorts.

10:44.309 --> 10:47.011
I told Axl that eating too much
takeout is bad for you.

10:47.045 --> 10:50.314
I told Axl-- well, I told Axl--
would you like some broccoli?

10:50.348 --> 10:52.783
I'd love some.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.519
Oh, Axl doesn't eat broccoli.

10:55.554 --> 10:57.021
Oh, sure he does.

10:57.055 --> 10:59.323
I told Axl
it's great brain food,

10:59.358 --> 11:01.659
And now he loves it.

11:01.693 --> 11:03.895
I told Axl...

11:03.929 --> 11:07.364
<i>Aah! Well, that's how it went in
my head, anyway. In reality...</i>

11:07.398 --> 11:10.367
Frankie, you got a really weird
look on your face.

11:10.401 --> 11:11.902
Is it a smile?

11:11.936 --> 11:13.403
Kinda.

11:13.437 --> 11:15.771
Then I'm doing good.

11:18.266 --> 11:19.132
<i>It was 3:00 in the morning,</i>

11:19.167 --> 11:21.635
<i>And I was way too worried
to sleep.</i>

11:21.669 --> 11:23.803
<i>Mike could sense it.</i>

11:23.838 --> 11:26.773
<i>Mike could sense it.</i>

11:26.807 --> 11:29.009
Mike.

11:29.043 --> 11:30.911
Where's my bat?

11:30.945 --> 11:33.780
She has way too much power
over him, Mike.

11:33.815 --> 11:36.817
Oh, God. See, that's why
I knew dinner was a bad idea.

11:38.353 --> 11:40.789
Axl will do whatever
she says. It's scary.

11:40.823 --> 11:42.624
Oh, you're exaggerating.

11:42.658 --> 11:44.927
<i>Hello? Were you not there?</i>

11:44.961 --> 11:47.362
Axl's eating broccoli now,
and that's how it starts.

11:47.396 --> 11:50.365
She tells him to eat broccoli,
so he does.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.835
Then she tells him
what friends he can have,

11:52.869 --> 11:54.370
What college
he should go to--

11:54.405 --> 11:56.339
He should go
to a college near her.

11:56.373 --> 11:58.307
So he moves there,
and when he does,

11:58.342 --> 12:00.777
She breaks up with him again,
and then she takes him back,

12:00.811 --> 12:02.746
And they get married
and have kids,

12:02.780 --> 12:04.815
And then she gets bored,
which is her pattern,

12:04.849 --> 12:06.216
So then they get divorced,

12:06.251 --> 12:07.684
And Axl's living
in our basement,

12:07.719 --> 12:09.686
And she's moved
with the kids to Florida,

12:09.720 --> 12:11.655
'cause that's where
her parents have retired,

12:11.689 --> 12:14.191
And they get to see
the grandkids all the time

12:14.225 --> 12:16.126
And get to be called
"Nana" and "pop-pop,"

12:16.160 --> 12:18.595
And we have to be
boring "grandma" and "grandpa,"

12:18.630 --> 12:21.065
And we only get to see them
once a year,

12:21.099 --> 12:23.434
And when we try to hug 'em,
they're all stiff and awkward,

12:23.468 --> 12:26.470
Because we're strangers to our own
grandkids! And it all starts with broccoli?

12:26.504 --> 12:29.574
It all starts with the broccoli!
I think you worry too much.

12:29.608 --> 12:31.943
I have a right to be worried.

12:31.978 --> 12:35.380
Our grandkids live in Florida! Frankie,
Axl's 16. His brain's not even fully developed yet.

12:35.414 --> 12:37.815
Brick's chick has
better judgment than he does,

12:37.850 --> 12:41.986
And it spent an hour trying to walk into a fan.
Don't try to make me laugh. I'm worrying.

12:42.020 --> 12:44.989
Well, stop. This relationship
doesn't mean anything.

12:45.023 --> 12:47.758
He's gonna
date a million girls.

12:47.792 --> 12:50.259
Some of 'em you'll hate
more than Morgan.

12:50.294 --> 12:53.096
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

12:53.130 --> 12:55.565
Fine.
You're hell-bent on worrying.

12:55.599 --> 12:58.101
I'll give you something
to worry about.

12:58.135 --> 13:00.535
We had a meeting at work today.

13:00.570 --> 13:03.132
They're cutting back
on our health insurance.

13:03.167 --> 13:05.266
Night, honey.

13:07.467 --> 13:10.001
<i>Brick wasn't
getting a lot of sleep either.</i>

13:10.035 --> 13:12.803
<i>At first he loved
being a mom to a baby chick,</i>

13:12.837 --> 13:14.371
<i>But like all new parents,</i>

13:14.405 --> 13:17.573
<i>The novelty wore off pretty quick.
It's coming. It's coming.</i>

13:17.608 --> 13:19.741
It doesn't pour itself,
you know.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.380
I just got home.

13:28.414 --> 13:30.881
Just give me a second
to get a juice,

13:30.916 --> 13:32.883
And then I'll play with you.

13:38.721 --> 13:41.789
Can I get one minute to myself?

13:46.428 --> 13:47.895
Morgan.

13:47.929 --> 13:50.997
Yeah? I just want to tell you that
I know you're head cheerleader

13:51.032 --> 13:53.432
And that I tried out
for cheerleading also,

13:53.466 --> 13:56.368
But the day before tryouts,
I dropped a big rock on my toe.

13:56.402 --> 14:00.238
Ohh.
Well... Maybe next year.

14:00.272 --> 14:01.739
Really?

14:01.773 --> 14:03.140
Thanks!

14:04.642 --> 14:06.042
Mom, Morgan thinks

14:06.077 --> 14:08.744
I should try out
for cheerleading.

14:10.580 --> 14:13.447
Okay, 5-minute warning
until we leave for the picnic.

14:13.481 --> 14:15.882
Aw, do I have to?
Morgan's practice got canceled.

14:15.917 --> 14:18.985
What's she supposed to do while
I'm at a picnic?

14:19.019 --> 14:20.853
<i>Play solitaire,
find a new boyfriend,</i>

14:20.887 --> 14:24.190
<i>Step in front of a bus...
Why doesn't she come with us to the picnic?</i>

14:24.224 --> 14:26.994
Really? Oh, I don't want to intrude.

14:27.028 --> 14:28.929
I'd really love you to come.

14:28.963 --> 14:31.430
<i>I couldn't believe
I'd said it either,</i>

14:31.464 --> 14:34.665
<i>But the truth is,
after I said it, I felt good.</i>

14:34.700 --> 14:37.734
All right. Let me just get
my purse out of Axl's room.

14:37.769 --> 14:39.069
Come on.

14:39.103 --> 14:41.438
<i>Maybe it was 'cause,
in the light of day,</i>

14:41.505 --> 14:43.507
<i>All my fears just seemed...
Silly.</i>

14:43.541 --> 14:45.375
<i>Mike was right.</i>

14:45.409 --> 14:48.345
<i>They were only 16, and what
was so wrong with Morgan?</i>

14:48.379 --> 14:50.480
<i>She's got
my son speaking Chinese</i>

14:50.515 --> 14:51.848
<i>And eating vegetables.</i>

14:51.883 --> 14:53.917
<i>That's not exactly
robbing banks</i>

14:53.951 --> 14:55.417
<i>And stealing cattle.</i>

14:55.451 --> 14:57.385
<i>What was I so worried about?</i>

14:57.419 --> 14:58.953
A picnic?

14:58.987 --> 15:01.955
It's not exactly what I felt like doing today.
 tell me about it.

15:01.990 --> 15:03.957
I'd rather hang out
at my house.

15:03.991 --> 15:06.959
My parents are more fun.

15:08.928 --> 15:11.364
I know, but what am I
supposed to do?

15:11.398 --> 15:13.300
Fine.
We'll go this once,

15:13.334 --> 15:16.370
But the next time your parents
ask us to do something,

15:16.405 --> 15:18.973
You're making up an excuse.

15:20.709 --> 15:23.744
This is gonna be a blast.

15:23.778 --> 15:25.846
Yay!

15:25.880 --> 15:29.583
<i>There better be booze
at this thing.</i>

15:33.558 --> 15:35.493
Hey, stretch.
You enjoying yourself?

15:35.527 --> 15:37.762
Now that I found the beer.

15:37.796 --> 15:40.698
Well, I'm just ad
I could throw this celebration

15:40.732 --> 15:42.666
For the employees.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.535
When you give, you get
a warm feeling in your ticker,

15:45.569 --> 15:48.870
You know?
That'll be 3 bucks.

15:48.905 --> 15:52.141
Mm-hmm. Uh, the pop's a buck
and a quarter there, princess.

15:52.175 --> 15:54.342
I'll get it.

15:54.377 --> 15:56.010
Oh, great.

15:59.649 --> 16:01.916
What?

16:01.950 --> 16:03.217
Nothing.

16:03.251 --> 16:06.320
<i>I mean, I shouldn't say anything
bad about Morgan, right?</i>

16:06.354 --> 16:08.756
Well, Brick,
just because you're a child

16:08.790 --> 16:11.258
Doesn't mean your opinion
is less than anyone else's,

16:11.292 --> 16:13.794
And I would hope that
you'd feel comfortable sharing

16:13.828 --> 16:16.930
Any negative feelings
you might have about Morgan.

16:16.965 --> 16:19.132
I'm not a big fan.

16:19.167 --> 16:22.169
I know, right? She comes across
as all together and perfect,

16:22.203 --> 16:24.604
But trust me,
I have heard things, Brick.

16:24.639 --> 16:27.374
She is manipulative,
deceitful, two-faced--

16:27.408 --> 16:30.977
<i>Plus she sat on my bed
and moved my books. Not cool.</i>

16:31.012 --> 16:32.712
Ohh.

16:32.747 --> 16:35.014
Yes, I'm watching you.

16:35.049 --> 16:36.649
That's great.

16:36.684 --> 16:38.918
Sorry. What was I saying?

16:38.953 --> 16:40.386
I'm wiped.

16:40.420 --> 16:42.388
He always wants to eat, play.

16:42.422 --> 16:44.356
I'm constantly cleaning up
after him.

16:44.391 --> 16:47.159
Throw in a car pool,
and we'll talk.

16:47.193 --> 16:50.596
Wow, I can't believe you picked
me as your partner. Yeah.

16:50.630 --> 16:53.432
<i>Yep, after days of worrying
about payback</i>

16:53.466 --> 16:54.933
<i>For stealing Pete's stomer,</i>

16:54.967 --> 16:58.169
<i>It looked like Bob was finally in the clear.
Aah! That's tight.</i>

16:58.203 --> 16:59.570
Yes, it is.

16:59.605 --> 17:02.372
I don't want you getting away,

17:02.406 --> 17:05.108
'cause I know you stole my customer, you little fink!

17:06.544 --> 17:08.078
Wha--
get--

17:15.486 --> 17:18.088
Come on, the kids lost
their cornhole partners.

17:18.122 --> 17:21.256
It's you and me on one side,
and Morgan and Axl on the other.

17:21.891 --> 17:23.223
Okay.

17:23.258 --> 17:25.826
<i>Whoa. Whose partner
did you want to be?</i>

17:25.859 --> 17:28.229
Oh, you were right
when you said that--

17:28.262 --> 17:31.365
Them on one side
and us on the other.

17:31.399 --> 17:33.434
I heard her talking, Mike.

17:33.468 --> 17:35.436
I didn't want to say anything,

17:35.471 --> 17:37.938
Because I didn't want
to ruin a good time,

17:37.973 --> 17:39.340
But let's just say,

17:39.374 --> 17:42.409
Morgan loves her family
more than she loves ours.

17:42.444 --> 17:44.545
Well, shouldn't she?

17:44.579 --> 17:47.081
God! You don't get it!

17:47.115 --> 17:48.582
You have no instincts!

17:48.617 --> 17:51.551
A bear could carry our child
off into the woods.

17:51.585 --> 17:53.753
You wouldn't even notice!

17:53.787 --> 17:57.156
Why are you making yourself nuts here?
I don't get it.

17:57.190 --> 18:00.759
I told you, there's
nothing you can do. Accept it.

18:00.794 --> 18:03.262
This is out of your control.

18:03.996 --> 18:07.132
<i>Wo Ni Ã i. That's not how
you say "I love you" in mandarin.</i>

18:07.167 --> 18:08.968
I told you, you have to study!

18:09.002 --> 18:11.170
<i>You know I'm doing
that semester in Hong Kong.</i>

18:11.205 --> 18:14.041
<i>And I told you, if you want
to go to Hong Kong with me,</i>

18:14.075 --> 18:15.408
You're gonna have to practice!

18:16.810 --> 18:19.510
<i>Yeah, this time
it wasn't in my head.</i>

18:19.545 --> 18:22.546
<i>This time I actually did it.</i>

18:24.315 --> 18:27.584
Oh, my God. I'm sorry!
I am so sorry.

18:27.618 --> 18:29.085
What did you do?!

18:29.120 --> 18:31.589
What? Nothing. I never tried
an overhand before.

18:31.623 --> 18:34.024
It got away from me.
Oh, my God.

18:34.059 --> 18:36.259
Morgan, I am so, so sorry.
I'm okay.

18:36.293 --> 18:39.094
Let's get you in the shade.
Ohh.

18:39.129 --> 18:42.331
Oh, my gosh!
Is she gonna be okay?

18:42.365 --> 18:45.000
She has to be okay.
Come on.

18:45.035 --> 18:46.435
Make a hole, people!

18:46.469 --> 18:48.637
My friend Morgan
is comin' through!

18:52.042 --> 18:54.010
I knew it.

18:54.045 --> 18:55.979
I'm not proud,

18:56.013 --> 18:57.815
But I sure feel better.

18:57.849 --> 19:00.319
<i>Yep,
it was petty and beneath me,</i>

19:00.353 --> 19:02.788
<i>And it didn't change anything,
but hey,</i>

19:02.822 --> 19:05.823
<i>Losing control as a parent
is a tough thing to accept...</i>

19:05.857 --> 19:08.959
<i>As Brick was about to find out.
I told my teacher scout hatched,</i>

19:09.794 --> 19:12.759
And she's making me
bring him back.

19:12.794 --> 19:14.928
I'm worried scout needs me.

19:14.962 --> 19:17.263
No matter how many times
I tell him,

19:17.298 --> 19:20.234
He just keeps running back to that fan.
I hear ya, honey. It's tough being a parent.

19:20.268 --> 19:21.702
You watch 'em make mistakes,

19:21.736 --> 19:24.204
And there's not a thing
you can do about it.

19:24.239 --> 19:26.173
Guess that's
the only way they learn.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.176
Even though the mom
is always right.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.144
You remember that
when you're 16.

19:30.179 --> 19:33.648
So, Brick, where is the chick?

19:35.584 --> 19:39.153
Hey, there's a message on
the machine from coach Giesken.

19:39.187 --> 19:41.789
You gotta send back
your medical evaluation

19:41.823 --> 19:44.659
Before summer practice starts.
Yeah, I don't know.

19:44.693 --> 19:47.162
Morgan told me I shouldn't
play football next year,

19:47.197 --> 19:50.166
Seeing as how practice might cut
into our summer together, so...

19:50.200 --> 19:51.300
Mm.

19:53.570 --> 19:56.438
But if he doesn't play football,
he'll never get a scholarship.

19:56.472 --> 19:58.940
And with no scholarship,
he can kiss college good-bye.

19:58.975 --> 20:00.909
He'll end up
in some crappy job,

20:00.943 --> 20:03.446
Living in our basement,
eating all our food,

20:03.480 --> 20:05.815
And stealin' beer money
out of my wallet.

20:05.849 --> 20:08.718
I don't like her, Frankie. I just don't.
 I know. I know.

20:08.752 --> 20:10.853
<i>I slept surprisingly well
that night,</i>

20:10.888 --> 20:12.722
<i>I think 'cause nature made it</i>

20:14.125 --> 20:17.094
<i>Nature's smart that way.
And the truth is,</i>

20:17.128 --> 20:19.596
<i>we didn't have to worry
about Morgan for long.</i>

20:19.630 --> 20:22.132
<i>Axl continued to date
the "love of his life"</i>

20:22.166 --> 20:23.600
<i>For three more weeks,</i>
