00:03.220 --> 00:06.090
How much are you still
looking to raise?

00:06.140 --> 00:07.939
Â£247.

00:09.140 --> 00:10.330
I see.

00:10.380 --> 00:12.690
We realise, of course,
it is a lot of money,

00:12.740 --> 00:15.770
but if you really want
to make a difference...

00:15.820 --> 00:17.410
Although, we'd be grateful.

00:17.460 --> 00:21.570
You see, the donations we receive
at mass have started to dry up.

00:21.620 --> 00:23.570
The congregation have
been very generous.

00:23.620 --> 00:25.530
If they don't want the
roof to fall in on them,

00:25.580 --> 00:28.780
they're going to have to
dig a little bit deeper.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.650
Well, this is exactly
the sort of cause

00:31.700 --> 00:34.410
I'd like our new fund to support.

00:34.460 --> 00:37.010
I'm sure we'll be able to make
a significant contribution.

00:37.060 --> 00:38.130
Oh, thank you.

00:38.180 --> 00:40.170
It's the least I can do.

00:40.220 --> 00:43.850
Your church plays an important
part in the local community.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.050
Thank you.

00:45.100 --> 00:48.700
What exactly do you mean by
"significant contribution"?

00:57.020 --> 00:58.610
Lady Felicia, how may I help?

00:58.660 --> 01:01.090
I'd like to make a deposit, please.

01:01.140 --> 01:02.890
This is a robbery!

01:02.940 --> 01:04.810
Stay where you are!

01:06.220 --> 01:09.220
Stay where you are or
I'll kill all of you!

01:36.860 --> 01:38.330
Open the vault!

01:38.380 --> 01:41.130
Mr Harrogate has the key.
He isn't here this morning.

01:41.180 --> 01:42.780
You're lying!

01:43.460 --> 01:45.060
Is that true?

01:45.700 --> 01:47.570
He's in the office.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.330
You'll get us all killed!

01:50.380 --> 01:52.290
Harrogate!

01:52.340 --> 01:55.410
If I follow Mr Harrogate out,
they may not notice you.

01:55.460 --> 01:56.810
You could hide.

01:56.860 --> 01:58.210
I'm not scared of them.

01:58.260 --> 01:59.370
Harrogate!

01:59.420 --> 02:02.520
You come out now or I'll
start shooting people!

02:03.780 --> 02:06.450
Stay calm. It's only money they want.

02:08.259 --> 02:11.360
~ I'll show them what for.
~ Please don't do any...

02:13.340 --> 02:15.690
And what do you think
you're playing at?

02:15.740 --> 02:17.330
Over there with the others!

02:17.380 --> 02:19.250
You, the priest, you're
coming with us.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.640
Cowards. That's what you are.

02:22.180 --> 02:23.370
What did you say?

02:23.420 --> 02:25.250
We didn't fight a war

02:25.300 --> 02:28.620
for your sort to go around
stealing from innocent people.

02:29.660 --> 02:31.450
There's no need for any trouble.

02:31.500 --> 02:34.440
Oh, shoot a defenceless
woman, would you?

02:35.580 --> 02:36.920
Gladly.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.060
Move it!

02:48.620 --> 02:50.100
The key!

02:51.100 --> 02:52.650
The money's replaceable, we are not.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.040
Open it!

03:07.460 --> 03:10.130
What the bloody hell's going on here?

03:15.140 --> 03:16.690
That was a stupid thing to do.

03:16.740 --> 03:18.490
You have to stand up to these people.

03:18.540 --> 03:21.210
~ Not when they're pointing
a gun at your head.
~ Shut up...

03:21.260 --> 03:23.000
We're going now!

03:26.540 --> 03:29.330
Et nomine patri et
filii spiritus sancti.

03:29.380 --> 03:31.140
~ Amen.
~ Amen.

03:39.460 --> 03:41.260
Did you know him?

03:42.860 --> 03:44.530
Billy Flanders.

03:45.220 --> 03:46.890
My son-in-law.

04:00.380 --> 04:02.250
I presume the vault was locked?

04:02.300 --> 04:03.410
Oh, of course.

04:03.460 --> 04:07.490
I keep the key on me at all times,
even sleep with it under my pillow.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.250
Who else has a copy?

04:09.300 --> 04:11.330
The clerks have keys
for the front door.

04:11.380 --> 04:13.980
No-one else has a key to the vault.

04:14.460 --> 04:16.170
Well, there must be a spare?

04:16.220 --> 04:18.209
Well, it's in the
safe at head office.

04:18.260 --> 04:20.649
But, if something had happened,
they'd have let me know.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.690
When did you last go into the vault?

04:22.740 --> 04:25.330
After we closed to
the public yesterday.

04:25.380 --> 04:28.130
We had a delivery scheduled
and I waited for it to arrive,

04:28.180 --> 04:30.130
escorted the couriers into the vault,

04:30.180 --> 04:32.210
and locked the door as they left.

04:32.260 --> 04:33.930
What was the delivery?

04:33.980 --> 04:37.050
Well, we often store valuable
items for other organisations,

04:37.100 --> 04:39.290
our part to help the local community.

04:39.340 --> 04:42.970
The gallery at Little Haydock are loaning
a valuable item from a collector in Paris.

04:43.020 --> 04:45.930
I said that we'd keep it safe
while they prepared the space.

04:45.980 --> 04:48.490
You're certain you locked the
door after it was delivered?

04:48.540 --> 04:49.530
Oh, yes.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.580
Mr Browning, our junior
clerk, was with me.

04:53.020 --> 04:56.060
So, the door was secure and
nobody else had access?

04:57.380 --> 05:00.320
I don't know how Billy
ended up in there.

05:05.540 --> 05:08.210
He was bound to find out
that Harrogate was here.

05:08.260 --> 05:10.450
I was trying to defuse the situation.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.300
By lying to an armed
robber? You idiot.

05:15.740 --> 05:18.010
It's been a trying day for us all.

05:18.060 --> 05:20.050
I'll bet that fool's over the moon.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.300
Why?

05:22.420 --> 05:24.850
Martin is the chief clerk.

05:24.900 --> 05:28.090
If Harrogate gets sent down,
he'll be left in charge.

05:28.140 --> 05:29.370
Really?

05:29.420 --> 05:31.170
Should have been me, of course.

05:31.220 --> 05:34.730
Harrogate's never appreciated those
of us who really put the hours in.

05:34.780 --> 05:38.330
Thank you, Mr Harrogate.
Please, don't go anywhere.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.770
Inspector...

05:39.820 --> 05:42.090
You'll have to wait
your turn, Father.

05:42.140 --> 05:44.770
I've a few observations I'd
like to share with you.

05:44.820 --> 05:45.810
As I said...

05:45.860 --> 05:49.730
Why did the man with the gun want
me to go to the vault with him?

05:49.780 --> 05:51.050
Julia!

05:57.020 --> 05:58.690
What's going on, Father?

05:58.740 --> 06:00.650
~ There was a robbery.
~ Are you all right?

06:00.700 --> 06:03.570
When we went into the
vault, we found...

06:04.820 --> 06:06.490
The thing is...

06:09.020 --> 06:10.770
~ It's Billy.
~ What about him?

06:10.820 --> 06:12.160
He's...

06:15.460 --> 06:16.810
No... No, Julia!

06:16.860 --> 06:18.010
I'm afraid you can't...

06:18.060 --> 06:19.600
Stay there.

06:27.180 --> 06:28.570
Mrs Flanders!

06:28.620 --> 06:29.610
Mrs...

06:29.660 --> 06:31.090
Don't look.

06:31.140 --> 06:32.680
Come back...

06:33.500 --> 06:34.890
I'm so sorry.

06:34.940 --> 06:36.490
Sir!

06:36.540 --> 06:38.010
Excuse me.

06:39.220 --> 06:40.690
Why did they kill him?

06:40.740 --> 06:43.090
The robbers didn't do it.

06:43.140 --> 06:46.140
He was already dead when
I opened the door.

06:46.220 --> 06:48.420
Then how did he get there?

06:54.020 --> 06:56.020
I'm sorry about Billy.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.410
Are you sure you're
going to be all right?

07:01.460 --> 07:03.220
Mr Harrogate...

07:06.420 --> 07:08.560
Is this your handwriting?

07:11.020 --> 07:12.370
Well, it...

07:12.420 --> 07:14.010
It looks like it, but...

07:14.060 --> 07:16.460
It was found in Billy's pocket.

07:17.340 --> 07:19.410
Well, I didn't write it.

07:22.980 --> 07:24.570
Samuel Harrogate, I'm arresting you

07:24.620 --> 07:26.650
on suspicion of the murder
of William Flanders.

07:26.700 --> 07:27.690
I didn't do it!

07:27.740 --> 07:31.450
~ What you say will be taken down
and may be given in evidence.
~ It wasn't me, I swear!

07:31.500 --> 07:33.330
I'm not a killer.

07:33.380 --> 07:34.720
Help me.

07:52.620 --> 07:54.160
Oh, dear...

07:55.180 --> 07:56.610
But it's not raining.

07:56.660 --> 07:59.130
There was a shower in the night.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.570
It must be trapped somewhere.

08:01.620 --> 08:04.420
Do you think we'll
still get the money?

08:06.100 --> 08:07.770
Always one for the melodrama.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.050
Could you not just
have stepped aside?

08:10.100 --> 08:11.250
As I was saying...

08:11.300 --> 08:14.580
Do you think the bank will still give
us the money to get the roof fixed?

08:15.980 --> 08:18.980
Well, the charitable trust
was Mr Harrogate's idea, so...

08:20.180 --> 08:22.850
Without him, I don't think
it's going to happen.

08:22.900 --> 08:26.050
And I don't know how many
more cake bakes we can do.

08:26.100 --> 08:30.140
People are sick and tired of having to
buy a Victoria sponge every other week.

08:32.620 --> 08:36.210
Mr Harrogate's daughter's reaction
was odd, don't you think?

08:36.260 --> 08:38.059
She was very calm.

08:38.740 --> 08:41.340
Don't you go sticking your nose in.

09:17.020 --> 09:18.890
Sorry to trouble you.

09:18.940 --> 09:20.690
I wondered if I might have a word.

09:20.740 --> 09:22.880
Well, of course. Come in.

09:30.540 --> 09:32.610
I wanted to offer my condolences.

09:32.660 --> 09:34.130
Thank you.

09:40.300 --> 09:43.580
If there is anything I can
do to help, please ask.

09:44.700 --> 09:47.010
Do you think my father
is responsible?

09:47.060 --> 09:48.090
No.

09:48.140 --> 09:49.210
Why?

09:49.260 --> 09:52.780
I saw his reaction when he
discovered your husband's body.

09:53.860 --> 09:56.060
He was genuinely surprised.

09:56.500 --> 09:59.900
Unfortunately, that's not the sort
of thing the Inspector sets store by.

10:01.380 --> 10:02.740
Oh...

10:06.580 --> 10:08.520
What do you believe?

10:08.940 --> 10:11.050
Father didn't like Billy.

10:11.100 --> 10:14.040
He pretended, for my
benefit, but I knew.

10:15.340 --> 10:18.490
It's a big step from not liking
someone to killing them.

10:18.540 --> 10:20.090
He was in the army.

10:20.140 --> 10:21.850
He's killed people before.

10:21.900 --> 10:24.570
How well do you know the two clerks?

10:25.860 --> 10:28.050
Stephen I'd cross
the street to avoid.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.770
But Martin's always been good to me.

10:31.580 --> 10:33.730
Did your father get on with him?

10:33.780 --> 10:35.530
Most of the time.

10:35.580 --> 10:38.610
My father turned him down
for a loan a few months ago.

10:38.660 --> 10:41.810
Martin was upset about it, but
things soon got back to normal.

10:41.860 --> 10:43.410
Why do you ask?

10:43.460 --> 10:45.660
Idle curiosity, I'm afraid.

10:46.700 --> 10:48.300
My apologies.

10:49.660 --> 10:52.960
If they find my father guilty,
they'll execute him.

10:53.660 --> 10:57.160
They may as well kill me,
too, while they're about it.

10:57.220 --> 11:00.220
I'll have lost everyone
that matters to me.

11:00.540 --> 11:03.840
I promise that I will do
everything I can to help.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.440
Could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.900
I had a very long bicycle ride.

11:48.620 --> 11:51.890
So, it's right around the corner,
you turn left at the stairs

11:51.940 --> 11:55.440
and then, to the top of the
stairs, you'll see the...

11:55.900 --> 11:57.330
Well...

11:57.380 --> 11:59.050
What a surprise.

11:59.100 --> 12:02.170
Inspector, I'm just here
on parish business.

12:02.220 --> 12:03.490
Hmm...

12:04.220 --> 12:06.450
I'd like to reopen at the
earliest opportunity.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.410
Yes, you should be able to
have your office back shortly.

12:09.460 --> 12:11.890
My men will need the vault
for a while longer.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.330
Well, that's fine, thank you.

12:13.380 --> 12:14.820
Sir...

12:19.780 --> 12:21.450
Good afternoon.

12:22.420 --> 12:25.170
So, you're in charge here now?

12:25.220 --> 12:26.930
Only temporarily.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.490
I'm not really qualified.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.770
And, besides, once they clear
up this mess with Mr Harrogate,

12:31.820 --> 12:33.820
he'll be back at work.

12:34.580 --> 12:36.170
You don't think he's responsible?

12:36.220 --> 12:37.850
Of course not.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.850
When I left the army, he took me
under his wing, gave me a job,

12:40.900 --> 12:42.250
a sense of purpose.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.930
He's a good man, not a killer.

12:44.980 --> 12:46.850
Considering how much
else he's done for you,

12:46.900 --> 12:49.500
it's strange he refused you a loan.

12:49.660 --> 12:51.460
Who told you that?

12:54.940 --> 12:57.850
That has nothing to do
with what happened here.

12:57.900 --> 13:00.570
I'm just trying to
understand his life.

13:00.620 --> 13:03.690
I believe he's innocent, but
I don't know how to prove it.

13:03.740 --> 13:07.140
Please, anything you
can tell me may help.

13:12.540 --> 13:15.900
My mother was dying, I wanted a
loan to help make her comfortable.

13:18.020 --> 13:20.290
But Mr Harrogate had good
reason to turn me down.

13:20.340 --> 13:21.540
Why?

13:23.300 --> 13:26.980
The bank had been financing a business
Billy set up when he married Julia.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.130
I knew it wasn't going well,

13:30.180 --> 13:32.170
but I didn't realise just
how bad things were.

13:32.220 --> 13:34.160
Was it making a loss?

13:34.540 --> 13:36.770
Mr Harrogate kept pouring
money into it

13:36.820 --> 13:38.730
but never seemed to
earn anything back.

13:38.780 --> 13:41.450
I stumbled across a
hint of it at first.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.740
I saw something unusual in a ledger
that was out on Mr Harrogate's desk.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.370
Got me thinking,

13:47.420 --> 13:49.690
so I looked into it further.

13:50.260 --> 13:53.360
It turns out the bank's
accounts don't balance.

13:53.940 --> 13:55.450
How is that possible?

13:55.500 --> 13:58.490
I think he was using the bank's
money to prop up Billy's business

13:58.540 --> 14:00.210
and keeping it off the books.

14:00.260 --> 14:02.090
He needed to recoup his losses.

14:02.140 --> 14:04.850
He knew I wouldn't be able
to repay a loan quickly, so...

14:04.900 --> 14:06.700
he turned me down.

14:07.340 --> 14:10.010
But why was he setting
up a charitable trust

14:10.060 --> 14:12.490
when the bank was short of money?

14:12.540 --> 14:13.730
I didn't know he was.

14:13.780 --> 14:16.090
What was Billy's business?

14:16.140 --> 14:17.850
An exclusive members' club.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.850
Well, that was the idea.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.840
In reality, it was
as seedy as they come.

14:23.500 --> 14:27.450
How could a seedy club swallow up so
much money it was breaking the bank?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.100
I've no idea.

14:35.500 --> 14:39.600
How did you feel about your daughter
marrying a known criminal?

14:40.620 --> 14:42.850
Billy was trying to put
his past behind him.

14:42.900 --> 14:45.040
You really believed that?

14:45.340 --> 14:46.540
Yes.

14:48.780 --> 14:50.780
Do you recognise this?

14:53.780 --> 14:56.170
It was a present from my daughter.

14:56.220 --> 14:58.570
~ I keep it on the desk in my office.
~ Hmm...

14:58.620 --> 15:01.490
We found it out back
in one of the bins.

15:01.540 --> 15:03.570
It has blood on it.

15:03.620 --> 15:07.250
And the strands of hair the same
length and colour as Billy's.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.640
Along with your fingerprints.

15:11.860 --> 15:15.980
Samuel Harrogate, I'm charging you
with the murder of Billy Flanders.

15:21.460 --> 15:23.060
We're closed!

15:23.500 --> 15:25.970
Erm...I'd like to speak with someone.

15:26.020 --> 15:28.130
We're closed forever.
The boss has died.

15:28.180 --> 15:29.770
That's why I'm here.

15:29.820 --> 15:31.420
Just go away!

15:33.860 --> 15:35.260
I said...

15:37.740 --> 15:39.410
Good afternoon.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.730
What do you want?

15:41.780 --> 15:45.850
I was at the bank this morning when
they discovered your boss's body.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.410
So, er...?

15:47.460 --> 15:50.760
The police suspect the bank
manager, Mr Harrogate.

15:51.580 --> 15:54.120
The man who helped fund this club.

15:54.380 --> 15:56.450
I just sell the drinks.

15:56.900 --> 15:59.210
I came here hoping to find
out what had happened

15:59.260 --> 16:01.890
and it seems I've found
out more than I expected.

16:01.940 --> 16:03.130
What do you mean?

16:03.180 --> 16:06.410
The men who robbed the bank
had their faces covered but,

16:06.460 --> 16:08.490
if you're interested in such things,

16:08.540 --> 16:10.890
you could recognise
them by their voices.

16:10.940 --> 16:13.880
Especially if they
let their accent slip.

16:14.420 --> 16:16.360
Shall we talk inside?

16:22.500 --> 16:24.300
Why are you here?

16:26.420 --> 16:29.820
I had a few personal items to collect
before the place gets shut down.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.500
Are you going to tell
anyone about me?

16:40.940 --> 16:42.610
Was this Billy's horse?

16:42.660 --> 16:43.890
Yeah.

16:43.940 --> 16:45.850
Did it live up to its name?

16:45.900 --> 16:48.900
~ A lame donkey could have
run faster than that.
~ Hmm...

16:50.620 --> 16:52.770
It was very brave of
you, coming here alone.

16:52.820 --> 16:54.620
I'm a man of God.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.180
I am never alone.

16:58.220 --> 17:01.380
And will your God telephone for an ambulance
if you have a little accident?

17:02.420 --> 17:04.770
The man who took me to
the vault was panicked

17:04.819 --> 17:07.160
by the sight of Billy's body.

17:07.579 --> 17:09.920
He wasn't a hardened criminal.

17:10.099 --> 17:12.500
Just a misguided and lost soul.

17:16.140 --> 17:18.849
I am not interested in the robbery,

17:18.900 --> 17:21.700
I am interested in
Mr Harrogate's life.

17:23.260 --> 17:26.290
I need to know how the
two crimes were connected.

17:26.339 --> 17:29.140
Tell me that and I'll
leave you alone.

17:30.980 --> 17:32.780
He made me do it.

17:33.020 --> 17:34.360
Who did?

17:35.780 --> 17:37.050
Billy.

17:38.260 --> 17:39.890
Billy planned the robbery?

17:39.940 --> 17:43.240
He asked me to gather everyone
into the main hall.

17:44.340 --> 17:46.410
And once that was done,

17:46.460 --> 17:49.290
I had to make sure that you come
to the vault with Mr Harrogate.

17:49.340 --> 17:50.810
~ Me?
~ Yeah.

17:51.660 --> 17:54.000
Yeah, he said you'd be there.

18:00.100 --> 18:03.250
Mrs McCarthy, I am
in dire need of tea.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.970
We've run out.

18:07.460 --> 18:08.490
Oh.

18:08.540 --> 18:11.370
~ But you could always buy some.
~ Hm.

18:11.420 --> 18:14.410
Now, I've looked at
these a hundred times

18:14.460 --> 18:18.820
and I just can't see how we can
afford to get the roof fixed.

18:20.020 --> 18:23.980
Maybe you'd like to start preparing
a sermon on Noah and his ark?

18:24.940 --> 18:28.130
I'd like to talk to Stephen,
the bank clerk.

18:28.180 --> 18:32.260
He has access to the bank and
clearly dislikes Mr Harrogate.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.970
Do you know where he lives?

18:36.020 --> 18:38.730
We have parish business to attend to.

18:38.780 --> 18:41.780
Apologies. I'm sorry to distract
you from your good work.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.050
Erm...

18:44.100 --> 18:47.170
I was going to speak to Lady Felicia
about something else anyway.

18:47.220 --> 18:48.930
I'm sure she'll know who to ask.

18:48.980 --> 18:52.080
I'm sure I can find out
exactly where he lives.

18:53.340 --> 18:57.380
If you could, that
would be marvellous.

19:03.380 --> 19:05.210
Father Brown is here.

19:05.260 --> 19:08.690
Apparently you've requested
a spiritual advisor.

19:08.740 --> 19:09.770
Oh, yes...

19:09.820 --> 19:11.760
Yes, that's correct.

19:12.660 --> 19:14.600
Thank you, Sergeant.

19:18.660 --> 19:20.210
~ Have you seen my daughter?
~ Yes.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.090
And does she think that
I'm responsible for this?

19:23.140 --> 19:26.260
She's confused. She does
not know what to think.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.810
I lost my wife to illness,
my son to the war.

19:31.860 --> 19:34.960
I couldn't stand it if
I also lost my daughter.

19:39.740 --> 19:42.210
I think she needs time to think.

19:42.820 --> 19:45.490
That's the one thing I may not have.

19:46.380 --> 19:50.940
I am here because I've discovered
that Billy planned the robbery.

19:52.100 --> 19:56.730
~ I've spoken to one of his men.
~ Billy? Are you sure?

19:56.780 --> 19:59.940
The one question that's been going
around in my head all day...

20:00.980 --> 20:02.580
.. is why me?

20:03.620 --> 20:06.370
Why was I taken to
the vault with you?

20:06.420 --> 20:10.130
Especially, as it turns out now,
that the robbers knew I was there.

20:10.180 --> 20:14.060
Billy must have... overheard me
setting up the meeting with you.

20:15.540 --> 20:18.530
I don't believe that
there was a trust fund.

20:18.580 --> 20:23.010
I think you invented it to make
sure that I was at the bank.

20:23.060 --> 20:25.000
Oh, don't be absurd!

20:26.020 --> 20:28.460
The question is, why me?

20:29.580 --> 20:31.370
I can think of only one thing.

20:31.420 --> 20:35.610
And the only thing I can think
of is that, erm... I'm a priest.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.600
And people trust me.

20:38.340 --> 20:41.170
And if I say that I saw money
being taken from the vault,

20:41.220 --> 20:42.690
no-one would question me.

20:42.740 --> 20:44.330
But why would Billy want that?

20:44.380 --> 20:45.920
To help you.

20:46.940 --> 20:48.930
You were cooking the books

20:48.980 --> 20:51.730
and sooner or later you
knew you'd be found out.

20:51.780 --> 20:54.290
And if the bank was robbed,

20:54.340 --> 20:56.850
you could blame any unexplained
losses on the thieves.

20:56.900 --> 21:00.730
But that is outrageous! I'm a
bank manager, not a criminal.

21:00.780 --> 21:02.930
I don't think you acted out of greed.

21:02.980 --> 21:06.080
I think you wanted to make
your daughter happy.

21:09.860 --> 21:12.900
The club was swallowing up money.

21:14.980 --> 21:19.010
And I imagine that the racehorse
wasn't cheap to train and stable?

21:19.060 --> 21:20.650
What racehorse?

21:20.700 --> 21:22.730
Flanders' Hope.

21:22.780 --> 21:24.770
~ Never heard of it.
~ You made a mistake.

21:24.820 --> 21:28.210
But I don't think you're responsible
for what happened to Billy.

21:28.260 --> 21:29.730
Thank you.

21:34.140 --> 21:37.090
You knew the robbery
was about to happen.

21:37.140 --> 21:40.010
Why would you kill
Billy in the one place

21:40.060 --> 21:42.770
where you knew he
would be discovered?

21:42.820 --> 21:46.210
No-one will believe that when
they realise what I did.

21:46.260 --> 21:48.170
Then we have to find the murderer

21:48.220 --> 21:51.810
before the police realise that
you were involved in the robbery.

21:51.860 --> 21:54.530
Do you think that might be possible?

22:25.500 --> 22:27.210
Mrs McCarthy...

22:27.260 --> 22:29.330
My mission was successful!

22:29.380 --> 22:31.320
You found the killer?

22:31.740 --> 22:33.900
Um, no.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.730
Oh, very good.

22:38.780 --> 22:43.490
Now, Mrs Peel at the bakery was able
to tell me where this Stephen lives.

22:43.540 --> 22:45.730
He's here in Kembleford.

22:45.780 --> 22:47.810
And I went to pay him a visit.

22:47.860 --> 22:49.530
You shouldn't have gone on your own.

22:49.580 --> 22:51.650
Well, I don't need
you holding my hand.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.370
Anyway, he's not there.

22:53.420 --> 22:55.820
I saw him drive off in his car.

22:56.260 --> 22:58.730
And a very nice car it was, too.

23:00.580 --> 23:03.180
How does a bank clerk afford a car?

23:03.860 --> 23:06.170
I've just been to the gallery
in Little Haydock.

23:06.220 --> 23:09.570
They have the most divine exhibition
of abstract human forms.

23:09.620 --> 23:12.160
Oh, you must have fitted right in.

23:14.620 --> 23:16.170
Did you speak to the gallery owner?

23:16.220 --> 23:18.170
Yes, Richard is such a darling.

23:18.220 --> 23:21.170
He confirmed that they've been storing
an item in the bank's vault.

23:21.220 --> 23:23.250
They've done so several
times over the years,

23:23.300 --> 23:24.770
so it was nothing unusual.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.250
~ So, Mr Harrogate wasn't lying?
~ No.

23:27.300 --> 23:30.610
The sculpture was delivered to the
bank at 5:30 yesterday afternoon

23:30.660 --> 23:33.330
and it's still there safe and intact.

23:35.540 --> 23:38.410
We keep coming up against
the same problem...

23:38.460 --> 23:40.730
We cannot prove Mr
Harrogate is innocent

23:40.780 --> 23:44.380
unless we can show how someone
else got into the vault.

23:44.780 --> 23:46.860
So, erm...

23:49.620 --> 23:52.020
We need to break into the bank.

23:58.460 --> 24:00.690
Lady Felicia, how can I help?

24:00.740 --> 24:02.730
Thank you for agreeing
to see me so late.

24:02.780 --> 24:05.730
After what happened,
I'm only happy to help.

24:05.780 --> 24:08.690
I'm afraid I'd like to withdraw
all of my savings.

24:08.740 --> 24:10.290
I no longer feel that...

24:10.340 --> 24:12.290
~ You don't need to explain.
~ Thank you.

24:12.340 --> 24:14.280
If you'll wait here?

24:32.300 --> 24:35.130
Excuse me! Oh, we need help, please!

24:35.180 --> 24:36.890
~ Help, please!
~ What's wrong?

24:36.940 --> 24:39.610
It's just, this place and the gun...

24:41.500 --> 24:42.900
Oh, my...

24:44.060 --> 24:46.130
Try and breathe slowly.

24:46.580 --> 24:49.620
I think she needs some water, quickly.
Quickly, get some water!

25:02.500 --> 25:05.300
Oh, yes, thank you.
I'm so embarrassed.

25:07.220 --> 25:10.520
~ Don't be.
~ Everything's fine. Thank you. Thank you.

25:17.220 --> 25:20.410
You could have worn something
a bit more practical.

25:20.460 --> 25:21.530
It's black.

25:21.580 --> 25:22.850
It's a dress.

25:22.900 --> 25:25.050
You can't rob a bank in a dress.

25:25.100 --> 25:28.700
It's not a dress. And we're
not going to steal anything.

25:29.580 --> 25:31.490
Should we wear stockings
over our heads?

25:31.540 --> 25:32.850
We haven't got any.

25:32.900 --> 25:34.650
We could ask Mrs McCarthy.

25:34.700 --> 25:37.240
Oh... I'd rather take my chances.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.440
Right...

25:50.900 --> 25:52.260
Ready?

26:11.780 --> 26:13.780
Wasn't so bad, was it?

26:29.580 --> 26:32.520
Do I want to know where
you had that made?

26:59.900 --> 27:01.640
The lid's loose.

27:05.180 --> 27:06.730
Blimey.

27:06.780 --> 27:09.980
Art lovers - right bunch
of nutters, aren't they?

27:15.020 --> 27:16.160
Oi!

27:17.010 --> 27:18.010
Oi!

27:18.060 --> 27:20.660
No, no, no, no! Let us out of here!

27:23.220 --> 27:24.360
Oi!

27:28.460 --> 27:30.890
What happens when we run out of air?

27:30.940 --> 27:32.280
Well...

27:33.300 --> 27:35.810
.. if we're lucky, the police
will find us and arrest us.

27:35.860 --> 27:38.850
Or whoever's just locked us
in could come back with a gun.

27:38.900 --> 27:42.000
But who'd be in the bank
this late at night?

27:42.700 --> 27:44.050
Other robbers?

27:44.100 --> 27:45.930
We're not robbers.

27:45.980 --> 27:48.730
Someone found their
way through that door.

27:48.780 --> 27:51.380
Yeah, Harrogate and he had the key.

28:00.540 --> 28:03.410
I've locked them in
the vault. Now what?

28:07.060 --> 28:09.170
~ Sid?
~ Mm-hm?

28:09.220 --> 28:11.290
These screws are loose.

28:15.140 --> 28:18.570
I think we've been looking
at this in the wrong way.

28:18.620 --> 28:22.100
This lock was designed to
keep people out, not in.

28:23.420 --> 28:25.820
Yeah, that's coming out nicely.

28:27.300 --> 28:31.010
I think the killer broke
out of the vault -

28:31.060 --> 28:32.400
not in.

28:33.540 --> 28:34.810
So how did he get in?

28:34.860 --> 28:37.400
And where did the body come from?

28:44.980 --> 28:47.490
All right, this bolt
is operated by the key -

28:47.540 --> 28:50.050
it holds the latch in place,
prevents the door from opening.

28:50.100 --> 28:52.100
We need to lift it up.

28:54.140 --> 28:57.140
Now we need something
to keep it from falling.

29:05.140 --> 29:07.700
That's the job. Now we slide.

29:18.540 --> 29:20.370
Ta-dah!

29:23.020 --> 29:24.220
What?

29:32.580 --> 29:34.380
And the other two.

29:50.420 --> 29:51.660
Ah.

29:54.300 --> 29:56.240
How did you get out?

29:57.500 --> 29:59.090
The same way the killer did.

29:59.140 --> 30:01.810
It was one of you, wasn't it?
You had the key all along.

30:01.860 --> 30:04.090
My associate had that
made this afternoon.

30:04.140 --> 30:05.530
I'm afraid he tricked you.

30:05.580 --> 30:07.050
We called the police.

30:07.100 --> 30:09.130
Huh! Like I believe that.

30:09.180 --> 30:10.530
You're the ones trespassing.

30:10.580 --> 30:13.330
The only way to prove
your father's innocence

30:13.380 --> 30:15.170
is if I could see inside the vault.

30:15.220 --> 30:17.650
~ You know who killed Billy?
~ No.

30:17.700 --> 30:19.690
But I know how they did it.

30:19.740 --> 30:21.940
How?

30:23.620 --> 30:26.250
If the police find us, we'll
be in serious trouble.

30:26.300 --> 30:28.050
~ Quick, into the office.
~ Wait!

30:28.100 --> 30:29.690
No, they broke in!

30:29.740 --> 30:31.410
Martin, please!

30:40.420 --> 30:41.730
We heard intruders.

30:41.780 --> 30:44.010
They ran off down the
alleyway opposite.

30:44.060 --> 30:45.330
Who were they?

30:45.380 --> 30:46.650
We couldn't see in the dark.

30:46.700 --> 30:49.500
Go quickly, you might
still catch them.

30:51.260 --> 30:53.410
Why are you here?

30:53.460 --> 30:55.010
There's a lot to sort out.

30:55.060 --> 30:58.410
I wanted to open for business
as usual in the morning.

30:58.460 --> 30:59.490
And you?

30:59.540 --> 31:01.210
I didn't want to be alone.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.800
Martin said I could sit with him.

31:05.020 --> 31:07.090
Stay here, both of you.

31:15.300 --> 31:16.770
Thank you.

31:18.140 --> 31:19.810
What did you find in the vault?

31:19.860 --> 31:22.490
There have been enough
false accusations.

31:22.540 --> 31:24.690
I'm not prepared to
say until I'm sure.

31:24.740 --> 31:26.490
You'll prove my father is innocent?

31:26.540 --> 31:27.850
I believe so, yes.

31:27.900 --> 31:31.290
What are you really doing
here, Mrs Flanders?

31:31.340 --> 31:33.740
Trying to make sense of things.

31:34.340 --> 31:37.890
Billy had involved me in some scam
of his, without my knowledge.

31:37.940 --> 31:39.250
The racehorse?

31:39.300 --> 31:41.290
How do you know about that?

31:41.340 --> 31:44.010
Who lights a fire on a summer's day?

31:44.420 --> 31:47.090
I found the contract - in your grate.

31:48.860 --> 31:51.810
I'd never seen that document before,

31:51.860 --> 31:54.090
although when I saw what
had happened to Billy,

31:54.140 --> 31:56.610
I knew he must have been
involved in something.

31:56.660 --> 31:59.850
So you wanted to destroy
the evidence,

31:59.900 --> 32:02.900
so the police didn't think
you were complicit?

32:05.460 --> 32:08.970
I asked Martin to help me find
out what else had been going on.

32:09.020 --> 32:10.210
And?

32:10.260 --> 32:12.690
Looks like Harrogate was
pouring money into the club.

32:12.740 --> 32:16.050
Billy was taking it out and
spending it on the horse.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.770
What was father thinking of,
giving Billy all that money?

32:18.820 --> 32:22.210
He was trying to make sure
Billy was a success -

32:22.260 --> 32:24.060
to make you happy.

32:24.500 --> 32:26.210
He was a fool.

32:26.260 --> 32:28.170
Was he? Maybe.

32:28.220 --> 32:30.010
But a well-meaning one.

32:30.060 --> 32:32.490
There's something else.

32:32.540 --> 32:36.010
We also checked Father's
private accounts.

32:36.060 --> 32:39.290
At the start of every month, he'd
withdraw a large amount of cash.

32:39.340 --> 32:41.930
So he was putting his own money
into the business, as well?

32:41.980 --> 32:45.970
No. The money started going
out before I met Billy.

32:46.020 --> 32:48.960
We don't know what
he was spending it on.

32:56.100 --> 32:58.570
~ Good morning.
~ Hey, get... get off there!

32:58.620 --> 33:00.930
Nice little number,
this. Bet it cost you.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.570
You'll scratch it.

33:02.620 --> 33:04.450
The night before the robbery -

33:04.500 --> 33:07.210
when the couriers arrived
with the statue -

33:07.260 --> 33:10.690
~ did you go to the vault with Mr Harrogate?
~ Yes, so?

33:10.740 --> 33:12.610
Do you happen to know
what time that was?

33:12.660 --> 33:14.050
It was about half past four.

33:14.100 --> 33:15.530
Good. Thank you.

33:15.580 --> 33:16.690
What's it to do with you?

33:16.740 --> 33:19.250
How long have you been
blackmailing Harrogate?

33:19.300 --> 33:21.290
Oh, come on. Cars don't come cheap.

33:21.340 --> 33:23.370
Nice digs you've got, too.

33:23.420 --> 33:25.690
I had a wealthy aunt.

33:25.740 --> 33:27.050
She died.

33:27.100 --> 33:29.050
We spoke to your landlord.

33:29.100 --> 33:31.490
He said you moved into
this house shortly after

33:31.540 --> 33:34.410
unexplained money started leaving
Mr Harrogate's account.

33:34.460 --> 33:35.530
Coincidence.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.850
I reckon he'd had enough
and wanted out,

33:37.900 --> 33:41.490
so you decided to punish him
by framing him for murder.

33:41.540 --> 33:43.210
I don't have a vault key.

33:43.260 --> 33:44.810
Neither does the killer.

33:44.860 --> 33:48.330
It's all right. If it wasn't you,
we can settle this here and now -

33:48.380 --> 33:51.480
if you tell us what you've
got on Harrogate.

33:52.700 --> 33:55.530
I was drinking in the
pub one evening -

33:55.580 --> 33:58.770
met a man who'd served
in Harrogate's regiment.

33:58.820 --> 34:00.090
Yeah? And what did he say?

34:00.140 --> 34:03.620
He knew what Harrogate had got
up to during the first war.

34:10.500 --> 34:11.699
Come.

34:19.780 --> 34:21.409
Have you been here all night?

34:21.460 --> 34:23.730
I can sleep when everything
is back to normal.

34:23.780 --> 34:25.449
How long have you known?

34:25.500 --> 34:27.449
What?

34:27.500 --> 34:29.770
That you're Harrogate's son?

34:31.380 --> 34:33.179
Who told you that?

34:37.739 --> 34:39.679
It's true, isn't it?

34:40.380 --> 34:41.520
No.

34:47.340 --> 34:49.570
My mother told me,
when she was dying.

34:49.620 --> 34:53.050
Why didn't you say anything
to Mr Harrogate?

34:53.100 --> 34:57.170
He was only with my mother briefly,
when he was on leave from the army.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.530
He's proud.

34:58.580 --> 35:01.410
He didn't want Julia to
know he'd been unfaithful.

35:01.460 --> 35:03.570
I can respect that.

35:03.620 --> 35:06.330
I was in the second war,
I know these things happen.

35:06.380 --> 35:08.850
Then how can you do this to him?

35:10.020 --> 35:11.370
I don't know what you mean.

35:11.420 --> 35:14.250
I know how you killed Billy.

35:14.300 --> 35:16.440
I want to understand why.

35:17.580 --> 35:21.140
Harrogate gave you a job, tried
to care for you, in his own way.

35:22.820 --> 35:27.250
I think you were happy with that
- and then Billy came along.

35:27.300 --> 35:30.370
Harrogate threw good money after bad,

35:30.420 --> 35:33.900
tried to make Billy into
the son you never got to be.

35:35.460 --> 35:38.090
You heard them planning the robbery.

35:38.140 --> 35:39.850
It was the final straw

35:39.900 --> 35:44.290
and it gave you the opportunity
to punish them both.

35:44.340 --> 35:45.770
The night before the robbery,

35:45.820 --> 35:47.890
Harrogate received the
delivery at the bank,

35:47.940 --> 35:50.210
signed for it and went home.

35:53.700 --> 35:56.500
But this delivery
wasn't the real one.

36:04.140 --> 36:05.970
You'd worked long enough at the bank

36:06.020 --> 36:08.810
to know that the vault
door could not be secured

36:08.860 --> 36:12.050
from interference from the inside.

36:12.100 --> 36:13.930
You opened the door,

36:13.980 --> 36:15.650
disposed of the crate...

36:15.700 --> 36:19.090
And then when the real deliverymen
arrived an hour later,

36:19.140 --> 36:21.810
they thought the door had
been opened for them.

36:21.860 --> 36:24.400
And they didn't know who you were.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.450
Working at the bank,

36:32.500 --> 36:35.090
you'd seen enough documents
that Harrogate had written

36:35.140 --> 36:38.850
to do a passable copy
of his handwriting.

36:38.900 --> 36:41.850
That's how you wrote the note
that lured Billy to the bank,

36:41.900 --> 36:43.770
later that evening.

36:46.940 --> 36:50.210
He thought he was coming
to see Harrogate...

36:50.260 --> 36:52.600
but you were waiting for him.

36:58.580 --> 37:00.530
To lock the door from the outside,

37:00.580 --> 37:03.810
you needed to make sure that
the bolt would not fall

37:03.860 --> 37:06.130
before the door was closed.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.580
An ice cube would do the trick.

37:14.220 --> 37:16.450
When it melted, the bolt would fall

37:16.500 --> 37:18.840
and the vault would be sealed.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.770
I noticed a little puddle of water

37:24.820 --> 37:27.020
when we found Billy's body.

37:27.780 --> 37:29.930
Police will never believe you.

37:29.980 --> 37:32.650
It's not them I'm trying to convince.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.770
Mr Harrogate...

37:35.820 --> 37:37.810
your father...

37:37.860 --> 37:41.130
tried to care for you
as best he could.

37:41.180 --> 37:43.090
He was ashamed of me.

37:43.140 --> 37:45.170
He was ashamed of himself.

37:45.220 --> 37:48.170
I can see how you could
be angry with him.

37:48.220 --> 37:50.370
But to take a life?

37:50.420 --> 37:53.970
All he cared about was rinsing
this bank of every last penny.

37:54.020 --> 37:56.560
We all paid because of his greed.

37:57.980 --> 37:59.570
Billy was a parasite.

37:59.620 --> 38:02.370
Nobody said he was a saint.

38:02.420 --> 38:06.330
And to be clever enough
to get all that money...

38:06.380 --> 38:08.650
he had to be stupid
enough to want it.

38:08.700 --> 38:11.240
I needed that money for my mother.

38:12.700 --> 38:15.330
She could have ended her
life somewhere comfortable -

38:15.380 --> 38:17.180
died with dignity.

38:17.860 --> 38:21.250
But Mr Harrogate chose to
spend that money on a horse,

38:21.300 --> 38:23.890
rather than the mother of his child.

38:23.940 --> 38:25.730
He didn't know about the horse.

38:25.780 --> 38:26.980
What?

38:30.100 --> 38:33.890
He still knew why I needed the money
and refused to loan it to me.

38:33.940 --> 38:36.330
He deserves to be punished.

38:36.380 --> 38:38.250
Yes, for his sins.

38:38.300 --> 38:40.810
Not for yours.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.970
And your sister?

38:43.020 --> 38:44.450
Did she ever mistreat you?

38:44.500 --> 38:46.240
I've work to do.

38:48.140 --> 38:50.850
Her life would be ruined also,

38:50.900 --> 38:54.610
if Mr Harrogate takes
the blame for this.

38:54.660 --> 38:57.370
He brought this on himself.

38:57.420 --> 38:59.820
Nobody's soul is beyond saving.

39:01.140 --> 39:03.080
I will pray for you.

39:05.540 --> 39:07.740
I don't want your prayers.

39:10.300 --> 39:11.650
What do you want?

39:11.700 --> 39:15.730
Your mother knew who Harrogate
was to you, all this time.

39:15.780 --> 39:17.530
She kept silent.

39:17.580 --> 39:20.610
She didn't even say a word
when he offered you a job.

39:20.660 --> 39:23.490
She could have blackmailed him.

39:23.540 --> 39:26.330
She could have got money,
ruined his reputation.

39:26.380 --> 39:29.650
Perhaps she didn't, because
she knew that if she had,

39:29.700 --> 39:32.700
she wouldn't have been
able to live with herself.

40:17.660 --> 40:21.930
So Martin didn't tell the police
that you planned the robbery?

40:21.980 --> 40:23.370
No.

40:23.420 --> 40:25.410
No, that was good of him.

40:25.460 --> 40:27.170
Why didn't you lend him the money?

40:27.220 --> 40:30.320
He can't have been asking
for a huge amount.

40:31.980 --> 40:33.580
That woman...

40:34.820 --> 40:37.810
She represented all that
was wrong with me.

40:37.860 --> 40:39.730
My weakness.

40:39.780 --> 40:41.650
"That woman"...

40:41.700 --> 40:44.240
wasn't a symbol, she was a person.

40:44.860 --> 40:47.770
Someone in pain, who
you could have helped.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.610
Someone who you cared for, once...

40:50.660 --> 40:52.450
however briefly.

40:52.500 --> 40:54.250
I'm sorry.

40:54.300 --> 40:57.340
I'm not the one you should
be asking for forgiveness.

41:24.100 --> 41:26.570
Thank you for telling the truth.

41:31.780 --> 41:35.820
I hope in time that you
can understand what I did.

41:38.180 --> 41:40.850
I admit I made some mistakes, but...

41:43.500 --> 41:45.610
.. the thing is...

41:45.660 --> 41:48.200
I loved my wife very much, and...

41:56.820 --> 41:58.490
I'm sorry, son.

42:10.100 --> 42:12.850
No water for two days.
Well done, Sid.

42:12.900 --> 42:13.930
My pleasure.

42:13.980 --> 42:16.010
You can say "thank
you" too, if you like.

42:16.060 --> 42:17.890
We should have had it
done professionally.

42:17.940 --> 42:19.290
We couldn't afford it.

42:19.340 --> 42:21.010
I have saved a fortune.

42:21.060 --> 42:23.570
All you needed to do
was plug the leaks,

42:23.620 --> 42:25.690
not replace the whole roof.

42:25.740 --> 42:27.680
Thank you, dear Sid.

42:30.100 --> 42:31.770
Morning, all.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.610
"Plug the leaks"?

42:44.660 --> 42:46.300
You get what you pay for.
