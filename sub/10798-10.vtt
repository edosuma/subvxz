You may want to start
with something like this.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.822
You are the most beautiful woman
in the galaxy.

15:11.869 --> 15:16.706

You don't know how long
l've wanted to tell you that.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.338

- Yes.

15:23.505 --> 15:26.007
- Of me?
- Of us. Of what we might become.

15:26.383 --> 15:27.467

15:27.635 --> 15:29.469
RlKER:
Or that you might think that was a line.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.304
Maybe l do think it's a line.

15:31.472 --> 15:34.098
- Then you think l'm not sincere?
- l didn't say that.

15:34.266 --> 15:37.810
There's nothing wrong with a line.
lt's like a knock at the door.

15:37.978 --> 15:40.396
RlKER: Then you're inviting me in?
- l'm not sending you away.

15:40.564 --> 15:42.106

That's more than l expected.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.816
ls it as much as you hoped?

15:43.984 --> 15:47.445
To hope is to recognize the possibility.
l had only dreams.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.239
- Dreams can be dangerous.
- Not these dreams.

15:50.407 --> 15:53.368
l dream of a galaxy
where your eyes are the stars.

15:53.535 --> 15:55.411
And the universe worships the night.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.247
Careful.

15:58.415 --> 16:02.168
Putting me on a pedestal so high
you may not be able to reach me.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.420
Then l'll learn how to fly.

You are the heart in my day
and the soul in my night.

Nothing to be concerned about.

some routine adjustments.

the deuterium control conduit

16:37.788 --> 16:39.622

16:57.266 --> 17:00.309
l perform periodic inspections
on all engineering systems.

17:00.477 --> 17:03.146
ln this case you seem
to have found a malfunction.

17:03.313 --> 17:04.564
lt's not a malfunction.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.066
lt's simply that a minute
defocused area has developed.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.693
Lowers our operating efficiency.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.070
lt could also lead
to excess pion production.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.905
Our computer would detect that.

17:13.073 --> 17:17.452
Unless, of course,

Sure.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.218
Really, it's quite simple.

18:15.385 --> 18:17.428
You just tell the computer
what you want

18:17.596 --> 18:19.055

Ensign Crusher, when you've finished
your duties in Engineering,

30:14.813 --> 30:16.980
- report to my Ready Room.
WESLEY [OVER COM]: Yes, sir.

30:17.148 --> 30:20.025
- You have the Bridge, Number One.
RlKER: Aye, sir.

30:27.700 --> 30:32.496
The woman, Anya,
is not what she appears to be.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.540
She is...

30:34.707 --> 30:36.667
An allasomorph.

30:37.585 --> 30:39.211
A shape shifter?

30:40.296 --> 30:41.463
Yes.

30:41.631 --> 30:47.177
She's not only a governess,
she's also the girl's protector.

30:50.348 --> 30:55.143
Now, l don't care to interfere
in the personal relationships

30:55.311 --> 30:58.146
of those under my command,

31:00.567 --> 31:02.776
but in this case...

31:03.611 --> 31:05.195
You want me to stay away from Salia.

31:05.363 --> 31:10.117
Yes, l do. For the good of the ship
and the safety of everyone onboard.

31:22.630 --> 31:24.840
l will do as you ask.

[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]

31:35.977 --> 31:38.854
Why won't you let me have a friend?

31:39.022 --> 31:41.440
lt is my duty
to protect you from danger.

31:41.608 --> 31:43.567
There's no danger here.

31:43.735 --> 31:47.279
There is always danger
from one who is not your kind.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.656
Salia, he's confusing you.

31:49.824 --> 31:52.284
You're forgetting
your responsibilities.

31:52.452 --> 31:55.996
Whether or not l see Wesley
is for me to decide.

31:56.164 --> 31:59.458
lt is not. l raised you.

31:59.626 --> 32:03.879
l protected you,
and l intend to deliver you to Daled lV.

32:04.047 --> 32:07.132
Maybe what you want
doesn't matter anymore.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.427
Salia, please.

32:11.179 --> 32:13.430
l know it's difficult for you.

But you must do
what you're destined to do.

distorting our signals.

32:51.177 --> 32:52.886
lt is fascinating, captain.

33:12.740 --> 33:15.409
Mr. Data, do whatever is necessary
to override the interference.

- You shouldn't have come.
- Do you want me to leave?

33:33.511 --> 33:36.221
- l didn't say that.
- Then you want me to stay.

33:36.389 --> 33:39.641
- Does Anya know you're here?
- That doesn't matter.

33:40.309 --> 33:41.768
l'm glad you came.

l thought Anya would have
kept you with her.

33:50.528 --> 33:52.738
l hope you didn't get in trouble
from your captain.

33:52.905 --> 33:54.948
Oh, l haven't gotten in trouble yet.

Maybe.

PlCARD:

35:10.525 --> 35:12.609
Since Anya's powers
of transformation

35:12.777 --> 35:16.279
apparently gave her the ability
to escape her guards unnoticed,

35:16.447 --> 35:18.865
we have sealed her quarters
with a force field

35:19.033 --> 35:22.452

how small a form she may take.

We have been expecting you.

35:31.921 --> 35:34.214
Sir, sensors indicate
the communication originated

35:34.382 --> 35:36.758
from a terawatt source on the planet.

35:36.926 --> 35:40.220
That's more power
than our entire ship can generate.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.848
lt is what is needed
to penetrate the atmosphere.

35:43.015 --> 35:45.559
Which means we lack the ability
to respond, sir.
