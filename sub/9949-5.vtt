WEBVTT

00:02.300 --> 00:05.020
Anyone watching thinking
we know fuck all

00:05.020 --> 00:09.340
about knowing fuck all about owt,
needs to watch their back...

00:09.340 --> 00:12.420
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:12.420 --> 00:14.340
sending prices sky-high...

00:14.340 --> 00:17.820
literally, literally taking
the grass from its own roots!

00:17.820 --> 00:20.940
Now you've
got your condemnation.

00:20.940 --> 00:24.700
Liberals noshing Tories like
altar boys picking dimps up!

00:24.700 --> 00:28.140
Have we had a national
fucking stroke, or what?!

00:28.140 --> 00:30.900
Is revolution a word...

00:30.900 --> 00:32.020
or was it never?

00:32.020 --> 00:34.580
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:34.580 --> 00:38.020
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:38.020 --> 00:41.300
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:41.300 --> 00:44.220
and they charge us for water.

00:44.220 --> 00:48.900
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found,

00:48.900 --> 00:52.100
this green and pleasant land
in ancient times...

00:52.100 --> 00:55.180
Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak!

00:55.180 --> 00:57.260
It's not theirs any more.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.940
This is our England now!

01:00.940 --> 01:03.180
Paaaarty!

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

01:16.180 --> 01:18.220
I don't do navel gazing.

01:18.220 --> 01:20.100
I don't believe in it.

01:20.100 --> 01:23.220
Boo-hoo-hoo, the reason
I'm such an arsehole

01:23.220 --> 01:26.540
is because my mammy never tucked me
in at night and read me a story.

01:26.540 --> 01:27.940
Fuck that.

01:35.780 --> 01:39.660
But this guilt -
it's a seductive bastard.

01:39.660 --> 01:42.700
Swelled up, washed over
and carried me off

01:42.700 --> 01:45.660
before I knew where I was,
so I find meself here.

01:47.220 --> 01:51.580
Seeing him, night after night,
day after day.

01:51.580 --> 01:53.660
Can't fucking shake him.

01:55.620 --> 02:00.220
Now I'm a grief junkie,
addicted to guilt.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.500
The knot in my chest,
the bile in my gut...

02:02.500 --> 02:04.620
I barely fucking recognise myself.

02:08.820 --> 02:10.139
Hey!

02:10.139 --> 02:11.460
Thank you.

02:11.460 --> 02:13.100
I'm so grateful.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.660
Is this what it's like to be weak?

02:41.820 --> 02:44.420
Hey, there you go. Good lad.

02:45.620 --> 02:50.180
Tomorrow morning, 5.30 -
I want you out your kip, rod in hand,

02:50.180 --> 02:52.300
if not I'll come and drag you.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.220
You're not my dad, you know.

03:07.100 --> 03:08.860
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate

03:08.860 --> 03:10.140
all the time you've
given him.

03:10.140 --> 03:12.380
He's a good kid. I enjoy it.

03:12.380 --> 03:16.380
He's had problems,
even before his Dad died.

03:16.380 --> 03:19.740
Well he's a teenage lad -
life's a problem.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.420
Anyway, I won't take up any
more of your time.

03:23.420 --> 03:26.620
Actually, I wanted to ask a favour.

03:26.620 --> 03:30.980
Eddie's sister's a total psycho,
always getting her digs in.

03:30.980 --> 03:33.820
When we got married,
we moved over here,

03:33.820 --> 03:37.900
so I kind of adopted
all Eddie's mates.

03:37.900 --> 03:39.900
I'm a little bit isolated...

03:40.860 --> 03:42.540
No relatives offering help?

03:44.580 --> 03:47.060
I need someone to help me
choose his headstone.

03:48.940 --> 03:51.580
It's too weird,
I'm sorry, I hardly know you.

03:51.580 --> 03:53.420
His sister's probably
got the right, anyway...

03:53.420 --> 03:55.580
I'd be glad to help.

03:55.580 --> 03:58.940
There's a couple of psychos in my
family - I know how that feels.

03:58.940 --> 04:00.380
Just let me know, yeah?

04:00.380 --> 04:01.740
Thanks. Danny?

04:04.060 --> 04:05.500
Do you want another cuppa?

04:13.940 --> 04:16.420
Hey, he's pretty nice,
what do you think?

04:16.420 --> 04:17.660
All right, isn't he?

04:17.660 --> 04:19.980
I know these give the right
impression and that,

04:19.980 --> 04:22.180
but I don't remember
anyone from the Sopranos

04:22.180 --> 04:24.860
drinking out of these
dickhead little cups.

04:24.860 --> 04:27.420
You on a drought or summat?

04:27.420 --> 04:28.940
She can feel you nudging
her from here.

04:28.940 --> 04:30.260
Fuck off!

04:30.260 --> 04:34.740
I'm looking for someone.
Someone in particular.

04:34.740 --> 04:38.860
What? Big tits, small tits,
blonde, brunette?

04:38.860 --> 04:40.820
Ginger - that's a fetish,
you know...

04:40.820 --> 04:41.860
No!

04:43.300 --> 04:46.860
I keep having this dream -
the same dream...

04:46.860 --> 04:49.260
I keep having one of them as well -
has it got a dolphin in?

04:49.260 --> 04:51.420
A sex dream.

04:51.420 --> 04:52.860
Yeah, so?

04:54.780 --> 04:57.140
Same thing, every night.

04:59.380 --> 05:02.700
It's incredible.
She's perfect, totally perfect.

05:04.140 --> 05:06.620
I can't get her out my mind,
I need to find her.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.060
Do you spunk in your PJs?

05:10.060 --> 05:12.300
I don't wear fucking PJs.

05:12.300 --> 05:16.340
I feel like I've seen her,
like I know her, but...

05:16.340 --> 05:18.220
What are you going to do
if she walks past?

05:18.220 --> 05:19.980
Chuck a brick at her head?
You're shit at talking to girls you.

05:19.980 --> 05:21.780
No, I'm not!

05:21.780 --> 05:23.820
Mate, come on.

05:25.260 --> 05:26.540
Yeah.

05:26.540 --> 05:30.180
You're right, better looking
they are, the worse I get.

05:30.180 --> 05:32.540
Look, I can give you lessons.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.980
What I do, right, is I stare
at them, into their soul.

05:35.980 --> 05:38.420
I draw them in.
It's irresistible, watch.

05:42.060 --> 05:42.940
Mate...

05:42.940 --> 05:44.980
Just watch!

06:09.980 --> 06:11.700
Oh, for fuck's sake...

06:13.060 --> 06:14.060
What you doing?

06:14.060 --> 06:16.500
I'm a working man now,
it's been a while.

06:17.580 --> 06:20.180
Don't suppose there's
any chance of a...?

06:20.180 --> 06:21.980
Y'know what I mean...?

06:21.980 --> 06:23.660
You being serious?

06:23.660 --> 06:24.940
Uh-huh.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.860
Well, hang on.

06:32.380 --> 06:36.020
Kelly, you are a beaut...
You're a woman, and I have needs.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.860
All right, look, wait...

06:41.260 --> 06:43.540
Mates rates?

06:43.540 --> 06:45.180
Just a nosh?

06:45.180 --> 06:46.260
It's not you...

06:46.260 --> 06:47.500
it's me.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.140
You can't say that,
we're not married!

06:49.140 --> 06:51.260
One of the few perks of this job

06:51.260 --> 06:54.220
is that I get to decide - always.

06:56.580 --> 06:59.420
Yeah, it was a stupid idea, anyway.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.460
I've seen you trying to
bleach your 'tache.

07:01.460 --> 07:03.660
Wouldn't be able
to get the picture out my head.

07:03.660 --> 07:06.100
And I couldn't do it to
Marty, anyway,

07:06.100 --> 07:08.180
I mean look at his little face.

07:24.700 --> 07:27.140
You filthy boy!

07:27.140 --> 07:28.460
Fuck!

07:28.460 --> 07:31.860
Tell me you're not going to slip
my wife a length, Danny/Shane?

07:31.860 --> 07:34.980
First you cave my head in and bolt,
hit and run, then befriend my son...

07:34.980 --> 07:36.380
which is creepy enough on its own,
by the way,

07:36.380 --> 07:38.100
and worm your way into me home

07:38.100 --> 07:40.180
and now you're looking
to pump me missus!

07:40.180 --> 07:42.580
My lovely, mourning missus,

07:42.580 --> 07:45.260
with that dirty little
Irish cock of yours?

07:45.260 --> 07:48.260
It's just fucking bad manners.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.220
And what's with
the pretendy name, eh?

07:50.220 --> 07:51.300
This is not going to end well.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.340
What's going on?

07:53.540 --> 07:55.260
What?

07:55.260 --> 07:56.700
You smashed a plate.

07:56.700 --> 08:00.020
Yeah, I did. I, eh...

08:01.380 --> 08:04.020
Tell your mum I had to shoot off,
yeah?

08:04.020 --> 08:07.100
Tomorrow morning, 5.30 sharp.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.700
Can you get the door?

08:29.700 --> 08:31.380
Where you headed, Sparky?

08:31.380 --> 08:33.220
Across the road to
that new family...

08:33.220 --> 08:35.100
they've been there a month and
haven't got a proper curtain up yet.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.460
How many times?

08:36.460 --> 08:39.500
It's not a family, it's
a knocking shop - it's competition!

08:39.500 --> 08:41.460
But they call the older one "Mum".

08:41.460 --> 08:44.900
They call her "Ma'am" - means
"Madam", the one who runs the gaffe.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.260
Well you lot don't call me "Madam".

08:46.260 --> 08:47.780
We call you "certifiable".

08:47.780 --> 08:50.660
And we're hardly going to
crush them with cake!

08:50.660 --> 08:52.300
But, I like to be good a neighbour.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.380
They want to put you
out of business, Lillian,

08:54.380 --> 08:55.900
and everyone here out of a job!

08:58.620 --> 08:59.980
Right.

09:06.180 --> 09:09.100
I preferred it when you didn't have
two pence to rub together.

09:09.100 --> 09:11.700
Yeah, well so did...

09:11.700 --> 09:13.220
Learn to take a compliment.

09:14.540 --> 09:17.100
You've had enough,
time to head off home.

09:17.100 --> 09:19.660
Got the horn...

09:19.660 --> 09:21.300
I need to de-juice...

09:21.300 --> 09:22.540
Urgh!

09:22.540 --> 09:24.940
You're less offensive-looking
than you used to be.

09:26.140 --> 09:28.300
Flattered as I am, I'm taken.

09:28.300 --> 09:31.180
Put your money away,
and pop off home.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.980
Don't even fucking
think about it, knobheads.

09:39.980 --> 09:43.420
Explicit sex dreams tell us a lot.

09:43.420 --> 09:46.220
Details are a big indicator of
our anxieties, our fears,

09:46.220 --> 09:48.580
our hopes in life.

09:48.580 --> 09:50.620
Fear of not getting laid,
hopes that we do.

09:50.620 --> 09:52.140
Yeah.

09:52.140 --> 09:54.860
And does she say anything to you,
this girl in your dreams?

09:54.860 --> 09:56.180
Does she talk to you?

09:56.180 --> 09:59.660
Yeah, mainly, "Oh, yeah, faster..."

09:59.660 --> 10:01.940
"Right there, please!"

10:05.060 --> 10:06.660
What the fuck's wrong with you?

10:06.660 --> 10:09.140
You're never here, and when
you are you're miles away.

10:09.140 --> 10:11.100
I'm sorry, what was the joke?

10:11.100 --> 10:12.900
Urgh!

10:15.380 --> 10:17.700
Stop that stupid staring!

10:17.700 --> 10:20.220
It's not seducing me,
it's just creepy!

10:23.860 --> 10:25.620
Oh, you fucking weirdo.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.340
Told you it don't work!

10:27.340 --> 10:29.380
It does work! Argh!

10:48.740 --> 10:50.540
Yes, is the answer.

10:50.540 --> 10:52.300
And very nice it was, too.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.220
They let you stay the night?

10:54.220 --> 10:56.820
Well, they didn't turf me out
or rob me.

10:56.820 --> 10:59.420
How much?

10:59.420 --> 11:02.580
I've nothing to compare it to -
never had to pay...

11:02.580 --> 11:04.700
How much, Frank?
You know what we charge.

11:05.660 --> 11:06.860
Half.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.540
Fuck!

11:20.180 --> 11:21.380
Are you gay?

11:21.380 --> 11:22.660
No.

11:22.660 --> 11:24.820
Are you?

11:24.820 --> 11:25.980
Fuck off.

11:27.580 --> 11:29.140
Why d'you keep looking at me?

11:29.140 --> 11:31.020
I'm trying to find something to say

11:31.020 --> 11:34.180
that'll help you not be such
a miserable little bastard.

11:34.180 --> 11:35.940
My dad died!

11:35.940 --> 11:38.300
Yeah, that's not a license
to be a dick all the time.

11:38.300 --> 11:39.780
You have to get past this.

11:43.460 --> 11:46.020
Have you got any drugs?

11:46.020 --> 11:47.460
Not for you.

11:49.020 --> 11:50.500
I'm off down the shops.

11:51.740 --> 11:53.780
He won't be back.

11:53.780 --> 11:56.100
They'll be next.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.180
It was an accident.

11:57.180 --> 12:00.700
The boy'll be found hanging from
a tree by the end of the year

12:00.700 --> 12:03.860
and his mother'll develop a vodka
and pills habit and run with it.

12:03.860 --> 12:06.100
How does that feel?

12:09.220 --> 12:10.940
Feels good, does it?

12:26.180 --> 12:30.420
- Take your time, Ches.
- I've nothing planned for the day

12:52.700 --> 12:54.420
You've got a fucking nerve.

12:54.420 --> 12:55.780
I don't want any trouble.

12:55.780 --> 12:57.100
So what do you want?

12:57.100 --> 13:00.100
Chewing gum. Maybe some mouthwash.

13:00.100 --> 13:04.300
Opening up directly across the road
is an act of war.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.060
We're just trying
to make a living.

13:06.060 --> 13:07.940
You're practically giving it away!

13:07.940 --> 13:12.220
Louise decides on that stuff -
prices, rota, shifts.

13:12.220 --> 13:13.580
You'll need to talk to her.

13:13.580 --> 13:14.900
We fucking will.

13:14.900 --> 13:19.620
And shortly after, you'll be
pulling down the shutters for good.

13:19.620 --> 13:21.220
We haven't got any shutters.

13:25.340 --> 13:28.700
Are you busking?
Should we throw coins?

13:28.700 --> 13:31.180
I've got a box of lo-cal
but it's out of date...

13:41.220 --> 13:44.940
It's you - from the dream.

13:44.940 --> 13:48.540
Fantasy Girl's a hooker. Delightful.

13:57.380 --> 14:00.060
What about the granite
with gold lettering?

14:00.060 --> 14:02.260
'Granite's for arseholes!
Go on, tell her.'

14:02.260 --> 14:05.620
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be good.

14:05.620 --> 14:06.700
'Oh, you bollocks.'

14:06.700 --> 14:09.020
I'll go and have a word with him.

14:10.900 --> 14:14.140
'Never saw this coming, did you?
Shopping for gravestones.'

14:14.140 --> 14:17.340
I didn't even want to meet them. I
was going to watch from a distance,

14:17.340 --> 14:19.300
make sure they were all right.
That's all.

14:19.300 --> 14:21.100
But you did meet 'em!

14:22.300 --> 14:24.260
Nice little ready-made family, eh?

14:24.260 --> 14:25.780
Tidy little broken-in wifey?

14:25.780 --> 14:26.900
Watch your mouth.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.700
Oh, he likes her. I fucking knew it.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.820
Your funeral weren't exactly
bursting at the seams.

14:32.820 --> 14:35.620
By all accounts,
you're a bit of an arsehole.

14:35.620 --> 14:37.900
Oh, that's right, yeah, justify it.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.700
Forgive yourself.
That's where this is heading, eh?

14:40.700 --> 14:44.860
Maybe you did them a favour by
killing the nasty husband and father?

14:44.860 --> 14:46.940
This'd be where you apologise.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.420
I am... sorry.

14:50.420 --> 14:53.140
Not good enough. Too easy.

14:53.140 --> 14:54.580
'I don't accept.'

15:03.260 --> 15:06.060
Oh, yeah...

15:06.060 --> 15:08.780
What the fuck are you doing?

15:08.780 --> 15:10.100
Hasn't worked since last year.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.900
I know your wife.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.540
As long as I don't bother her,
she don't mind.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.020
Ohh!

15:16.020 --> 15:17.300
Ohh.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.980
Dirty bastard.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.540
Credit card payments, online booking,

15:28.540 --> 15:33.540
profile of every girl, so's
a selection can be made in advance.

15:33.540 --> 15:36.780
My girls know exactly when they're
working, for how long, and with whom.

15:36.780 --> 15:39.620
She said "with whom".

15:39.620 --> 15:42.940
Live web-cam in one
of the rooms upstairs.

15:42.940 --> 15:45.140
I've got another one
on the girl in the window.

15:45.140 --> 15:48.340
You're not worried about getting
busted, being so... in-your-face?

15:48.340 --> 15:50.340
We're well-connected.

15:50.340 --> 15:54.020
Assuming she can't actually hump out
there for public consumption,

15:54.020 --> 15:55.460
how does she get paid?

15:55.460 --> 15:57.580
She doesn't.

15:57.580 --> 16:01.220
We all have to take our turn,
raise the profile of the place.

16:09.580 --> 16:11.980
This is all wrong.

16:11.980 --> 16:13.580
It's efficient.

16:13.580 --> 16:15.460
It might be the oldest profession

16:15.460 --> 16:17.500
but it's still a dirty secret
for a reason.

16:17.500 --> 16:18.700
And that would be...?

16:18.700 --> 16:20.460
That it is dirty!

16:20.460 --> 16:23.100
And risky and wrong.
It's part of its lasting appeal.

16:23.100 --> 16:27.460
You serve it up with lattes
and frappuccinos, and you make it...

16:28.820 --> 16:30.060
What?

16:30.060 --> 16:31.780
Just another transaction.

16:31.780 --> 16:33.020
Would that be so bad?

16:33.020 --> 16:35.940
Depends. Does the coffee
come free with the girl,

16:35.940 --> 16:37.900
or the girl with the coffee?

16:37.900 --> 16:41.860
You're smart.
There's a job here if you want it.

16:46.260 --> 16:48.460
You're going to wear a hole
in t'carpet.

16:48.460 --> 16:50.460
They didn't even have carpets
across the way, did you notice?

16:50.460 --> 16:52.900
There's room enough
for two brothels.

16:52.900 --> 16:56.700
No, sweetheart, there isn't.
That's the whole fucking point.

16:56.700 --> 16:58.580
25 girls on her books!

16:58.580 --> 17:00.580
Students paying their tuition,

17:00.580 --> 17:02.380
single mums boosting their income,

17:02.380 --> 17:04.020
fucking credit cards,
discreet billing.

17:04.020 --> 17:05.460
It's not right, is it?

17:05.460 --> 17:06.940
T'internet's not for sex.

17:06.940 --> 17:08.700
I've been saying it for months

17:08.700 --> 17:10.339
that we had to make changes,

17:10.339 --> 17:12.339
and now it's too late.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.740
We are so fucked.

17:30.260 --> 17:33.140
Don't do anything
I wouldn't with this.

17:33.140 --> 17:35.500
It's coffee.
I was going to drink it.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.220
What would you use it for?

17:38.220 --> 17:40.500
I... I'd drink it.

17:46.940 --> 17:50.860
That might be the lamest thing
I've ever seen.

17:50.860 --> 17:52.060
Shut up.

17:52.060 --> 17:53.580
You get your fair share

17:53.580 --> 17:56.580
of silly little tarts
with less underwear than sense

17:56.580 --> 17:59.100
so I never had you down
as a foot-in-mouth merchant.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.140
I'm not!

18:01.140 --> 18:02.220
Usually.

18:03.740 --> 18:05.500
Only when it matters.

18:05.500 --> 18:11.060
Tell me you're not thinking you can
win the fair heart of the hooker?

18:11.060 --> 18:12.100
Oh!

18:14.140 --> 18:16.820
Well, perhaps she'll give it all up,

18:16.820 --> 18:19.940
cook your tea of an evening, and
breed little shop-children for you?

18:19.940 --> 18:21.900
Yeah, laugh it up.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.020
I could help.

18:37.900 --> 18:40.660
Oh, excellent.
Now you're a knicker-sniffer.

18:40.660 --> 18:42.540
Fuck off.

18:42.540 --> 18:45.940
Maybe they've found out,
done a runner, called the cops.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.060
Sorry.

18:50.060 --> 18:51.980
Wondering where you'd got to.
Thought I'd turned up a bit early.

18:51.980 --> 18:54.340
Unscheduled stop at school.

18:54.340 --> 18:55.420
Suspended.

19:08.740 --> 19:11.580
He's a trophy masturbator.

19:11.580 --> 19:14.580
Or a danger wanker.

19:14.580 --> 19:16.660
He... masturbates in public places...

19:16.660 --> 19:19.860
on the bus, in the dining hall,

19:19.860 --> 19:21.340
the school library...

19:26.420 --> 19:29.100
We thought we'd put an end to it.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.540
Nothing for almost a year,

19:31.540 --> 19:32.660
and then Eddie died.

19:34.100 --> 19:36.420
This is the second incident
since the funeral.

19:36.420 --> 19:38.900
School and police have been patient,
you know,

19:38.900 --> 19:41.220
circumstances and all that,

19:41.220 --> 19:42.620
but no more.

19:42.620 --> 19:44.620
Next time, it'll be
the children's panel.

19:44.620 --> 19:46.820
What stopped him the first time?

19:46.820 --> 19:48.420
Months of counselling

19:48.420 --> 19:50.540
and eventually,

19:50.540 --> 19:52.260
the back of Eddie's hand.

19:52.260 --> 19:54.580
What can I say? I'm old-fashioned.

19:54.580 --> 19:56.740
I won't have him hit again.

19:56.740 --> 19:58.660
Course not.

19:58.660 --> 20:03.740
How you going to sort this one out,
Super-Danny? Danger wanking?

20:03.740 --> 20:06.220
I'm best off out of it.

20:07.820 --> 20:09.580
All right, girls?

20:09.580 --> 20:11.340
Fancy a drink?

20:15.540 --> 20:16.940
What are we having?

20:19.020 --> 20:20.220
You're not going to serve them,
are you?

20:20.220 --> 20:23.500
We're a pub, Kel. It's what we do.

20:24.860 --> 20:26.380
Hiya.

20:26.380 --> 20:28.900
Er, four vodkas, please.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.460
OK.

20:38.580 --> 20:40.260
So what do you think?

20:42.580 --> 20:43.780
Love pad?

20:45.780 --> 20:49.140
It'd be like living
inside a messy boy's pocket,

20:49.140 --> 20:51.260
and smells like it.

20:51.260 --> 20:53.740
No disrespect,
but how can you help me?

20:53.740 --> 20:56.820
Because women weren't
invented in 2001 by Simon Cowell.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.020
We've been around a while.

21:00.260 --> 21:03.700
I could tell you what to say.

21:06.620 --> 21:09.780
I was chatted up once or twice
in my time.

21:09.780 --> 21:11.580
By men?

21:12.700 --> 21:17.060
By fecking llamas!
What do you think?

21:17.060 --> 21:18.900
Attach this to your phone.

21:20.700 --> 21:24.100
I'll hear what you say,
and what she says.

21:24.100 --> 21:29.380
And I can instruct you
what to say via this.

21:29.380 --> 21:30.660
Stick it in your lug.

21:33.340 --> 21:36.900
It's a Cyrano de Bergerac thing.

21:36.900 --> 21:38.580
What? Is that Irish?

21:39.740 --> 21:41.820
What if it doesn't work?

21:41.820 --> 21:43.340
Ah.

21:45.940 --> 21:48.140
Can you hear me?

21:48.140 --> 21:49.780
Argh! Shit!

21:49.780 --> 21:51.500
I adjusted the volume to max.

22:01.660 --> 22:03.340
Why are you not working tonight?

22:03.340 --> 22:05.980
I'm on call. See? Me beeper.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.540
Who's watching t'shop?

22:09.540 --> 22:11.980
There's nobody in
so I thought I'd come and see you.

22:11.980 --> 22:13.260
Oh, aye?

22:13.260 --> 22:15.020
I think we can go all modern.

22:15.020 --> 22:17.860
I've got a fella coming
to lay laminate,

22:17.860 --> 22:21.500
I can get a subsidy for a lap-top
from t'social cos of my age, and...

22:21.500 --> 22:22.740
I can do credit cards.

22:22.740 --> 22:24.460
You don't get it, do you?

22:24.460 --> 22:27.860
Click-flooring and carbon copies
won't make a difference!

22:29.220 --> 22:30.900
Whoa. Take it easy.

22:30.900 --> 22:33.660
It's not just how the shop's run.
It's you, Lillian!

22:33.660 --> 22:36.620
It's everything about you.
The world's moved on

22:36.620 --> 22:39.540
and you're still stuck in
Abigail's fucking Party.

22:41.380 --> 22:42.780
I can change.

22:42.780 --> 22:44.060
No, you can't!

22:44.060 --> 22:45.580
But I can.

23:01.420 --> 23:03.660
That job offer still stand?

23:23.420 --> 23:25.300
Breaking and entering.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.940
You're a regular A-Z
of criminal behaviour.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.900
She gave me a key. She trusts me.

23:30.900 --> 23:33.420
Why are you rifling through
her knicker drawer?

23:33.420 --> 23:35.500
I'm looking for proof.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.220
Of what?

23:37.220 --> 23:39.500
Of the fucking scumbag
I know you are! Were.

23:39.500 --> 23:42.380
And when you find this proof,
what then?

23:42.380 --> 23:46.380
Everybody sleeps a little easier,
mourns a little less.

23:46.380 --> 23:48.340
You sure that's what
she needs to hear...

23:48.340 --> 23:51.700
that maybe her dead husband didn't
love her as much as she thinks?

23:51.700 --> 23:53.540
I'd hide it in the bottom.

24:06.540 --> 24:09.020
You were good to yourself.

24:09.020 --> 24:11.700
Life's for living, mate.
No pockets in a shroud, evidently.

24:12.940 --> 24:15.340
Weekend breaks, florists, gifts.

24:15.340 --> 24:17.460
She didn't know about any of this,
did she?

24:17.460 --> 24:19.220
Every man has his secrets.

24:19.220 --> 24:21.460
Why would you risk it,
fuck it all up? This place, her?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.980
I didn't fuck it up.

24:23.980 --> 24:26.420
Was all going great
till you came along.

24:26.420 --> 24:27.540
She loved me.

24:27.540 --> 24:29.300
And the boy?

24:29.300 --> 24:31.420
He's... He's delicate.
I thought we'd fixed him.

24:31.420 --> 24:34.900
Oh, that's...
That's on me as well, is it?

24:34.900 --> 24:36.900
Better watch the time.

24:36.900 --> 24:40.660
She catches you up here,
she'll be asking for that key back!

24:55.860 --> 24:57.340
'Is she there?'

24:57.340 --> 24:58.420
Yeah, she's here.

24:58.420 --> 24:59.340
Pardon?

24:59.340 --> 25:00.220
Not you.

25:02.660 --> 25:04.780
Can she see you?

25:04.780 --> 25:06.100
Yeah. She sees me.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.780
Pardon?

25:07.780 --> 25:08.940
Her!

25:08.940 --> 25:11.420
Cross to her then.

25:12.780 --> 25:13.860
My mouth's gone all dry.

25:13.860 --> 25:14.820
Pardon?

25:14.820 --> 25:18.260
I will kick you in the bollocks
if you speak again.

25:18.260 --> 25:20.340
I had to tell you that
I dream about you.

25:20.340 --> 25:23.180
"I had to tell you that
I dream about you."

25:23.180 --> 25:26.420
Beautiful dreams, wondrous dreams,

25:26.420 --> 25:28.500
dreams that swell my heart.

25:28.500 --> 25:29.700
Are you sure, Patty?

25:29.700 --> 25:31.740
Fecking say it!

25:31.740 --> 25:34.740
"Beautiful dreams, wondrous dreams,
dreams that swell my heart."

25:34.740 --> 25:37.820
I can't hear you, shopboy.

25:37.820 --> 25:40.500
But you must take your hand off
the window or Louise will get...

25:42.300 --> 25:45.140
She's touching my hand
through the glass.

25:45.140 --> 25:50.140
I'd like to walk with you, just once,
take your arm in mine.

25:50.140 --> 25:52.980
Fuck off! I'm not saying that.

25:52.980 --> 25:54.900
If you're chasing romance,
you need to.

25:54.900 --> 25:56.420
'I'm not chasing romance.'

25:56.420 --> 25:58.340
I want to ride her,
like in my dreams.

25:58.340 --> 25:59.620
You're an arsehole!

26:07.900 --> 26:10.580
I never said I wanted to marry her,
have babies and a Volvo!

26:10.580 --> 26:11.860
Nor did you tell me

26:11.860 --> 26:15.380
it was about dipping your filthy
little apology for a penis.

26:15.380 --> 26:16.860
That's cos you never asked.

26:16.860 --> 26:18.980
You just jumped in,
all Sir Stano di... whatever.

26:18.980 --> 26:21.300
Cyrano de Bergerac.

26:21.300 --> 26:23.980
I don't speak fucking Irish!

26:23.980 --> 26:26.060
I hope your appendage drops off
from lack of use.

26:26.060 --> 26:28.060
That's hardly fucking likely, is it?

26:56.660 --> 26:59.060
You should have
your own show.

27:00.660 --> 27:03.980
Why do you do it,
toss off in public?

27:03.980 --> 27:06.580
Breaks your mum's heart, you know.

27:06.580 --> 27:08.780
And don't give me that shit about
your dad,

27:08.780 --> 27:09.660
because it was going on long before.

27:09.660 --> 27:10.700
Bored.

27:10.700 --> 27:11.660
Sit! Down.

27:13.740 --> 27:16.540
Oh, I see it now. You are like him.

27:16.540 --> 27:19.020
Listen, if I have to clip you,
I won't feel guilty.

27:19.020 --> 27:22.660
Is that what you're 'ere for,
cos you feel guilty?

27:22.660 --> 27:24.020
You don't even know us.

27:24.020 --> 27:25.500
Uh-oh, do you think he knows?

27:25.500 --> 27:28.140
Nah, he can't do.

27:28.140 --> 27:31.100
Must be wondering why a stranger's
sniffing round his mother.

27:31.100 --> 27:32.380
I am not...

27:36.420 --> 27:38.540
I knew this lad at school once,
right?

27:38.540 --> 27:42.220
He took a kicking at break.
Shat himself in the process.

27:42.220 --> 27:45.700
Today, he's a teacher
or an accountant.

27:45.700 --> 27:48.980
Summat that requires
fucking work anyway.

27:48.980 --> 27:50.900
The point is,
to everyone round our way,

27:50.900 --> 27:54.660
he's still known as the boy that
shat himself. Always will be.

27:54.660 --> 27:56.580
Is that really what you want?

27:56.580 --> 27:58.380
To be the lad that spunks himself?

27:58.380 --> 28:00.340
Spunky Sean?

28:07.420 --> 28:08.980
Keep your pecker in your pants, eh?

28:13.420 --> 28:15.060
Was it you, Shane?

28:15.060 --> 28:18.220
Was it you who did a poo-poo
in your pants at school?

28:20.100 --> 28:21.860
Just made it.

28:23.220 --> 28:26.260
Or a little late,
but let's not split hairs.

28:26.260 --> 28:29.340
So, what's the scores on the doors?

28:29.340 --> 28:32.780
It will be slow until we've got your
profile and some pictures online.

28:32.780 --> 28:35.060
Can't expect them to book blind.

28:35.060 --> 28:36.580
Course not.

28:36.580 --> 28:39.580
Every girl's responsible
for their own profile,

28:39.580 --> 28:42.980
escorting and full service.
Are you computer literate?

28:42.980 --> 28:45.380
Four days Business Admin at school.

28:46.780 --> 28:49.060
I shop, therefore I am.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.420
In the meantime,
it's just passing trade,

28:51.420 --> 28:53.660
though you'll soon build up
your own client base.

28:53.660 --> 28:57.340
Don't want to blow my own trumpet,
but I breed loyalty.

28:57.340 --> 28:59.620
Often by blowing their trumpets,
but...

28:59.620 --> 29:01.620
If I'm going to be sitting around,

29:01.620 --> 29:05.060
I might as well sit around in there
and drum up some business.

29:15.180 --> 29:17.780
'How long do you plan
on hanging around?'

29:19.820 --> 29:21.500
Could ask you the same question.

29:21.500 --> 29:23.860
I'm your guilty conscience,
you tell me.

29:23.860 --> 29:26.900
Feeling good about yourself?

29:26.900 --> 29:30.140
Caused more harm than good?
Know what I think?

29:30.140 --> 29:31.700
Oh, enlighten me.

29:31.700 --> 29:33.780
I think you won't be right
until you own up.

29:33.780 --> 29:38.260
Until you tell the less-than-merry
widow that you killed her husband.

29:38.260 --> 29:40.740
Might still be a chance for you,
if you're honest.

29:40.740 --> 29:42.140
Hiya.

29:42.140 --> 29:43.700
Hiya.

29:43.700 --> 29:46.180
Did you talk to Sean?

29:46.180 --> 29:48.300
Uh-oh, you fucked up.

29:48.300 --> 29:51.940
He went to football training.
The first time since Eddie died.

29:51.940 --> 29:52.980
Good.

29:52.980 --> 29:55.140
Thanks.

30:09.340 --> 30:10.620
Ooh, 'ere she is.

30:20.260 --> 30:23.020
Come on, let the 'tache see the gash.

30:23.020 --> 30:24.220
Get...

30:52.220 --> 30:54.940
For what it's worth,
I think you're a cunt.

30:56.740 --> 30:58.140
Danny?

30:59.540 --> 31:01.140
Danny?

31:01.140 --> 31:04.860
I'm going to toss most of this
stuff, at last.

31:07.660 --> 31:09.620
But this...

31:09.620 --> 31:11.620
Eddie never wore it.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.500
Cos I prefer to not look like a tit.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.620
Seems a shame.
I'm sure it'll fit.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.340
Oh, you're her bitch now.

31:17.340 --> 31:18.900
She's giving you gifts.

31:18.900 --> 31:21.900
Either that, or she's completely
flipped, full bhuna mental.

31:21.900 --> 31:22.860
I like it.

31:39.340 --> 31:41.420
How're you finding it?

31:42.740 --> 31:44.540
It's different.

31:44.540 --> 31:46.300
Are you on?

31:46.300 --> 31:48.860
Not till next week. Fingers crossed.

31:48.860 --> 31:53.580
I meant, on the job. I won't ask
about your cycle till my second day.

31:53.580 --> 31:57.460
Two o'clock, father and son.
Hoping Dad's just chaperone.

31:57.460 --> 31:58.740
Cherry-popper.

32:00.220 --> 32:02.380
What are you doing here?

32:02.380 --> 32:05.860
Why aren't you in college,
or travelling, or something?

32:07.860 --> 32:11.220
Just because she gave you a bed,
doesn't mean she owns your soul.

32:11.220 --> 32:13.700
Louise has been wonderful to me.

32:14.820 --> 32:17.180
Are you two...?

32:17.180 --> 32:20.020
No! That's disgusting.

32:20.020 --> 32:22.620
But a father and son
is just a "two o'clock".

32:29.860 --> 32:35.220
What you have to understand is that
without engagement of the heart,

32:35.220 --> 32:38.300
you might as well be pulling
your own plonker.

32:38.300 --> 32:41.860
What you don't understand is,
I really want her.

32:41.860 --> 32:43.620
It's like a physical pain.

32:43.620 --> 32:46.100
Why would you think I don't
understand the pain of longing?

32:46.100 --> 32:47.220
Cos I have a pension book?

32:47.220 --> 32:50.060
This is the age

32:50.060 --> 32:53.660
at which you will make your memories.

32:53.660 --> 32:57.380
And they have to last you a lifetime,
so they'd better be good.

32:57.380 --> 32:59.900
I treasure mine very much.

33:00.980 --> 33:03.540
You have to earn her.

33:03.540 --> 33:04.820
But that's what I was doing.

33:04.820 --> 33:06.020
Respect her.

33:06.020 --> 33:08.500
Think about what the girl does
for a living.

33:08.500 --> 33:11.940
She's an object 12 hours a day.

33:11.940 --> 33:14.860
Now think about how great
it would be for her,

33:14.860 --> 33:17.780
if she thought you
considered her more

33:17.780 --> 33:20.620
than just a repository
for your clumsy fuck.

33:43.100 --> 33:46.740
'Look at you, sitting there
drinking your Frappuccino,

33:46.740 --> 33:48.220
'like you're not a scumbag.'

33:48.220 --> 33:50.260
Yeah.

33:50.260 --> 33:53.900
'You have actually stole my life.
Do you want my coat an' all?'

33:53.900 --> 33:57.140
I mean these stains'll come out
in a boil wash.

33:57.140 --> 33:59.660
Yak, yak, fucking yak!

33:59.660 --> 34:02.780
Change the record. You stepped out
into the road, get over it.

34:02.780 --> 34:04.260
Why shouldn't I have the life?

34:04.260 --> 34:08.179
The fucking woman, the boy, the home
why? C'mon, why not me?

34:08.179 --> 34:11.060
Are you fucking better than me,
are you? You deserve it, I don't?

34:11.060 --> 34:14.540
I'm supposed to just get back
in my fucking box, know my place?

34:14.540 --> 34:16.380
I could...

34:16.380 --> 34:18.139
I could care for 'em, right?

34:19.900 --> 34:23.179
Careful what you wish for.
Just ask your mate there.

34:27.980 --> 34:30.219
Only drinks bought on the premises,
Shane.

34:52.739 --> 34:55.780
It's weird seeing you doing a shift
somewhere else.

34:55.780 --> 34:59.340
I'm going to bring the place down
from the inside - Trojan Hooker.

35:01.180 --> 35:04.060
It's not healthy, Shane.

35:04.060 --> 35:07.900
Talking to schizophrenic ghosts
just cos you feel so bad for her.

35:07.900 --> 35:10.660
Technically, you'd be the
schizophrenic one, not the ghost.

35:10.660 --> 35:12.980
Even widows have to move on
sometime.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.980
I just don't see why you...

35:14.980 --> 35:16.100
I killed him.

35:18.220 --> 35:21.620
I hit him with a motor,
a couple of months ago.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.900
9 weeks, 4 days as it goes.

35:24.900 --> 35:27.020
Did you stop?

35:27.020 --> 35:28.420
Course I did.

35:28.420 --> 35:30.340
He'd had a skinful and...

35:32.180 --> 35:34.020
...he was dead at the scene.

35:36.020 --> 35:38.100
I just didn't see who benefits...

35:38.100 --> 35:40.780
if I get banged up for five years.

35:40.780 --> 35:41.820
No.

35:43.820 --> 35:47.220
You have to stop seeing this woman,
immediately.

35:47.220 --> 35:49.220
He was a prick to her, Kelly.

35:50.420 --> 35:52.420
Other women, secret credit cards.

35:52.420 --> 35:54.500
His lad's a right fucking mess.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.460
And every other excuse
under the sun.

35:56.460 --> 35:58.740
She's lost her husband,
you're the bloke who did it,

35:58.740 --> 36:01.060
and you're in her bed.

36:01.060 --> 36:03.460
Get out and let the woman mourn,
for fuck's sake!

36:03.460 --> 36:04.820
Should I tell her?

36:04.820 --> 36:06.820
It might ease your conscience.

36:06.820 --> 36:11.100
But it'd kill her stone-dead,
nothing surer.

36:32.580 --> 36:36.820
Don't look at me!
We can't be seen together.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.380
How goes it?

36:38.380 --> 36:41.180
Nightmare.
Haven't a clue what I'm looking for.

36:41.180 --> 36:44.140
Tell me about it, story of my life.

36:44.140 --> 36:47.180
Think the gaffer suspects something.
She's always got her eye on me.

36:47.180 --> 36:51.300
Fucking spreadsheets
and databases and "online this".

36:51.300 --> 36:53.980
It's de-humanising. It's a
whole new level of cattle market.

36:53.980 --> 36:56.660
Still talking about the brothel?

36:56.660 --> 37:01.220
Yes! Just look dumb and clueless.

37:01.220 --> 37:02.580
I'll try.

37:13.380 --> 37:16.060
I'm looking for Danny McKenzie.

37:18.500 --> 37:21.660
I think he drinks in here.

37:21.660 --> 37:22.740
We need more of a clue.

37:22.740 --> 37:24.500
You're not CID, are you?

37:24.500 --> 37:26.260
You talk funny.

37:26.260 --> 37:28.740
What d'you want this fella for?

37:28.740 --> 37:31.260
I think he's fucking my mum,
and I'd like him to stop.

37:32.780 --> 37:36.260
No Danny McKenzie I know of,
in here, son.

37:36.260 --> 37:37.660
Can I use your toilets?

37:37.660 --> 37:39.700
Yeah, they're through there.

37:42.860 --> 37:45.660
What a strange little boy.

37:45.660 --> 37:47.380
Pardon?

37:47.380 --> 37:48.420
What a strange...

37:54.700 --> 37:58.140
I'm not open for another 45 minutes.

38:00.900 --> 38:02.340
This way, I'll know what
it's like to be an object.

38:02.340 --> 38:03.460
Of ridicule.

38:03.460 --> 38:04.580
Whatever.

38:27.740 --> 38:32.540
You know, I think it's working.
I'm starting to feel pretty horny.

38:32.540 --> 38:33.940
Fuck off - really?

38:33.940 --> 38:36.660
Yeah. But not for you,

38:36.660 --> 38:39.420
with that fucking weird
staring thing you're doing.

38:39.420 --> 38:42.420
Thanks for your help. No of fence.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.220
OK.

38:48.820 --> 38:50.740
See you, love.

38:50.740 --> 38:52.140
Oh...

38:52.140 --> 38:56.540
He's still got some of
that liquid soap on his hands.

38:56.540 --> 39:00.060
There's no liquid soap in the gents.

39:01.140 --> 39:04.220
Oh, the dirty little fucker!

39:08.860 --> 39:10.420
Off out?

39:10.420 --> 39:11.460
Won't be late.

39:11.460 --> 39:13.820
Nice jacket.

39:13.820 --> 39:15.260
Thanks.

39:15.260 --> 39:18.780
There was a lad in the bar today,
looking for a Danny McKenzie.

39:20.900 --> 39:25.820
Troubled lad. Give Ruby
something to remember him by.

39:25.820 --> 39:28.180
You know we're here for you,
don't you?

39:28.180 --> 39:30.180
Always.

39:52.060 --> 39:53.700
Come on, you bastard.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.340
Hiya, Guv'nor, how's it hanging?

39:58.340 --> 39:59.620
What are you doing?

39:59.620 --> 40:02.340
Praying, then... having a shower...

40:02.340 --> 40:04.980
It's a whole cleansing thing,

40:04.980 --> 40:08.660
saying thank you to
the Lord for my good fortune.

40:12.740 --> 40:14.460
How would you assess me?

40:14.460 --> 40:18.300
Decade on the game, historic Class A
habit, a bad marriage behind you.

40:18.300 --> 40:20.820
Contemplating batting
for the other side.

40:20.820 --> 40:25.500
I meant,
Employee or Sole Trader... for tax.

40:27.420 --> 40:29.700
We need the room.

40:29.700 --> 40:31.420
I dry quick.

40:52.500 --> 40:56.060
You're my hero.

41:08.140 --> 41:11.540
If you could let the boy
think he's earned it,

41:11.540 --> 41:14.540
I'd be much obliged.
Make some memories for him.

41:14.540 --> 41:16.620
No problem.

41:27.900 --> 41:29.740
What the fuck?!

41:38.060 --> 41:40.540
No!

41:40.540 --> 41:44.380
What's the biggest problem
of living in the digital age?

41:44.380 --> 41:45.340
There's no such thing as privacy.

41:45.340 --> 41:47.820
Named in it one, Sparky

41:47.820 --> 41:49.220
What the fuck have you done?!

41:49.220 --> 41:53.340
Credit card details, post-codes,
mobile numbers - online

41:53.340 --> 41:57.100
and vulnerable -
and recently emailed to spouses

41:57.100 --> 41:59.820
and employers
from this very computer.

41:59.820 --> 42:01.660
Four days Business Admin, you said.

42:01.660 --> 42:04.580
I'm a woman, I shop.
What more do you need to know?!

42:04.580 --> 42:06.140
We're protected.

42:06.140 --> 42:08.340
I doubt that very much,

42:08.340 --> 42:10.580
once Mrs Deputy Commissioner
opens her emails.

42:10.580 --> 42:12.420
Wouldn't you say so, Dep?

42:14.180 --> 42:15.820
May I?

42:21.900 --> 42:23.820
What's that for?

42:23.820 --> 42:26.700
Because we're not animals.
Use it to go and see the Wizard.

42:26.700 --> 42:27.900
Ask him for a brain.

42:29.100 --> 42:30.700
I don't understand.

42:30.700 --> 42:31.380
That's my point.

42:31.380 --> 42:33.900
What, so the rest of us
are out of work?

42:33.900 --> 42:37.020
You live to exploit another day -
just not round here.

42:37.020 --> 42:39.660
I won't go.
I waited two years for this house.

42:39.660 --> 42:41.660
Here y'are.
Consider it compensation, love.

42:41.660 --> 42:43.140
I'm sure the Dep can put a word in,

42:43.140 --> 42:46.060
for another house
in another borough.

42:46.060 --> 42:50.660
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we have a business to run.

43:02.100 --> 43:05.580
'You have to end it,
it's the kindest thing.'

43:05.580 --> 43:07.620
Shut up.

43:07.620 --> 43:08.940
'It's called closure, mate.

43:08.940 --> 43:13.300
'She can't start mourning me
until you're out the picture.'

43:13.300 --> 43:15.820
She loved me.

43:15.820 --> 43:17.940
I know.

43:17.940 --> 43:19.300
Maybe she loves you.

43:21.860 --> 43:23.100
Hello?

43:25.700 --> 43:27.060
Smelt the smoke.

43:27.060 --> 43:29.700
'You have to end this.'

43:29.700 --> 43:30.820
Do you mind?

43:30.820 --> 43:32.100
'It's the only way.'

43:34.060 --> 43:36.580
Didn't expect to see you tonight.

43:36.580 --> 43:38.980
Yeah, I just came round
to drop this off.

43:38.980 --> 43:43.380
Not really me to be honest. love.
It's a bit fucking gay, isn't it?

43:45.180 --> 43:46.620
Sean, could you give us a minute.

43:53.140 --> 43:54.500
Is everything all right?

43:54.500 --> 43:55.580
'Now's your chance.'

43:55.580 --> 43:56.900
Everything's sweet.

43:58.660 --> 44:00.060
What you doing?

44:00.060 --> 44:01.380
Come on, don't be coy.

44:01.380 --> 44:02.020
Stop it.

44:02.020 --> 44:05.620
Oh, you're one of them are you?
Give it, hold it back, give it.

44:05.620 --> 44:07.180
Fuck off!

44:07.180 --> 44:09.220
Don't fucking play games with me,
love, because I've had better.

44:09.220 --> 44:10.260
You fucking haven't!

44:10.260 --> 44:11.740
I want you to go.

44:11.740 --> 44:13.460
'Go on - finish it.'

44:13.460 --> 44:16.780
You - you're damaged goods.

44:16.780 --> 44:18.300
You need me.

44:18.300 --> 44:19.740
I barely know you.

44:21.060 --> 44:25.940
And that's how fucking desperate
and weak you are.

44:25.940 --> 44:27.980
Get out!

44:33.340 --> 44:34.700
Be seeing you, then.

44:35.980 --> 44:38.220
I certainly fucking hope not.

44:45.860 --> 44:49.660
'Guilt seduces.
Like a stolen glimpse of flesh,

44:49.660 --> 44:53.340
'a sliver of thigh,
the shadow of a breast.'

44:53.340 --> 44:54.300
Biscuit?

44:55.620 --> 44:58.940
'It takes strength to resist.

45:00.740 --> 45:02.340
'But the pain remains.

45:03.780 --> 45:05.060
'A reminder.

45:09.100 --> 45:12.700
'I try not to do navel gazing.

45:12.700 --> 45:14.260
'It hurts too much.'

45:21.780 --> 45:23.340
I've had one of me visions.

45:23.340 --> 45:25.220
Lottery numbers? A warning.

45:25.220 --> 45:26.980
You alone?

45:26.980 --> 45:29.860
Jamie loves you.
And he'd cut off his own bollocks

45:29.860 --> 45:31.540
rather than cheat on you.

45:31.540 --> 45:32.380
Karen knows.

45:32.380 --> 45:35.460
So tell her what a good boy I am,
it's business as usual, yeah?

45:35.460 --> 45:38.140
I've got the ring
but then I see her and I bottle it.

45:38.140 --> 45:40.180
Ask her to marry you.

45:40.180 --> 45:42.540
Marty, everything all right
in there, mate?!

45:42.540 --> 45:44.140
This is from one of Marty's kids.

45:44.140 --> 45:45.940
His wife, his kids
are all still alive.

45:45.940 --> 45:46.860
I'll be back.

45:46.860 --> 45:48.180
I don't want you to go, Marty.

45:48.180 --> 45:49.780
I have to find out what happened.

46:35.900 --> 46:36.820
You're full of shit.

46:36.820 --> 46:38.260
Shut up! I'm concentrated.

46:38.260 --> 46:40.740
What, like orange juice?!

46:47.260 --> 46:49.780
Fucking yes, fucking did it!

46:49.780 --> 46:54.740
Ha-ha, ha-ha! YES!
