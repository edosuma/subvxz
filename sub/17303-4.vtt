Hi, I'm Rory Reid and welcome to
Extra Gear -

00:14.880 --> 00:17.400
each week serving up Top Gear
exclusives as only Extra Gear can.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.880
Tonight, we go behind the scenes of
my Kia Stinger film...

00:24.160 --> 00:27.840
I'm in a Kia and quite enjoying it!

00:35.680 --> 00:39.040
..I draw on my limited engineering
skills

00:42.240 --> 00:44.439
to create Kia's other
rear-wheel drive car.

00:44.440 --> 00:52.440
Yeah, I know what you're thinking -
this guy's a genius!

01:09.000 --> 01:12.360
Chris takes the race-prepped Citroen
2CV from tonight's Top Gear

01:16.240 --> 01:17.520
around Dunsfold.

01:21.640 --> 01:29.640
45 horsepower in a 2CV, I mean,
that's an enormous amount of power.

01:35.440 --> 01:40.760
And I'll be joined by two-time
British touring car champion

01:42.400 --> 01:44.120
Colin Turkington
and comedian Brennan Reece.

01:44.840 --> 01:46.960
Oh, it's a good 'un.
This is Extra Gear.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.640
OK, let's get our guests out.

02:13.080 --> 02:17.200
First up is Team BMW driver
Colin Turkington!

02:27.000 --> 02:30.040
Take a seat.

02:31.800 --> 02:35.800
And actor, comedian and viral
online sensation, Brennan Reece!

02:40.800 --> 02:44.840
All right, Colin, I want to start
with you.

02:47.840 --> 02:53.440
You race for Team BMW?

02:54.440 --> 02:57.800
Yeah, one of the best jobs
in the world.

03:03.240 --> 03:07.760
I race in the British Touring Car
Championship in a BMW M125i.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.360
I've driven the road car.

03:16.760 --> 03:20.120
What's your race car like?

03:24.440 --> 03:28.280
Nothing like the road car at all!

03:37.920 --> 03:39.880
This is a thoroughbred racer.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.680
It's a six-speed sequential
gear box, two-litre turbo-charged,

03:46.440 --> 03:48.720
about 370 brake horsepower,
so it's a proper bit of kit.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.040
You've won not one
but two championships,

03:52.800 --> 03:55.040
almost made it a hat-trick,
but it didn't quite come off.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.200
What happened? Nearly got
the Triple Crown this year.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.760
It went right down to the
final race,

04:04.680 --> 04:07.160
round 30 of 30, and unfortunately
I got knocked off in the end.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.881
That's part and parcel of touring
cars but I've got the hunger to come

04:20.760 --> 04:22.640
back and hopefully get that
third championships.

04:24.160 --> 04:27.000
I read on the Team BMW website that
apparently you're a rear-wheel drive

04:27.680 --> 04:32.640
specialist. What does that
actually mean?

04:35.120 --> 04:37.960
You're a bit of a hooligan? I think
those guys are a bit biased, really.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.241
You've got to be comfortable with
the car sliding and moving about, so

04:49.440 --> 04:54.360
that's what I'm used to, that's what
I love, and that's why I think I've

04:56.880 --> 04:59.320
won the championships.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.480
All right, as you guys know,
tonight on Top Gear,

05:06.320 --> 05:09.120
I tested the Kia Stinger,

05:10.480 --> 05:12.960
Kia's very first rear-wheel drive
offering, and Extra Gear went

05:14.040 --> 05:16.120
behind-the-scenes to capture this
momentous occasion.

05:21.640 --> 05:24.000
Morning, everyone.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.640
Welcome to a very wet, very
miserable Dunsfold.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.841
We have a 20-foot tall tower with
every country in the world on there.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.680
And we're going to see where Korea
comes in terms of fastest cars in

05:38.440 --> 05:40.960
the world. It's actually quite
a busy day - we've got three cars

05:41.320 --> 05:43.840
but I'm going to try and get as many
of the words out of the way

05:44.680 --> 05:47.360
as possible so we can have fun,
get some nice, slidy, dynamic stuff.

05:52.960 --> 05:56.120
We had a long day ahead of us and
it looked as though the notorious

05:57.520 --> 05:59.960
Dunsfold microclimate wasn't
planning on doing us any favours.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.960
Classically, Dunsfold is a million
seasons in one day.

06:08.160 --> 06:12.000
We started off with rain, constantly
wiping those lenses down.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.120
I'm hoping for sun, get that lens
flare going,

06:17.200 --> 06:21.200
but I think it's a tall order today.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.560
Looking a bit miserable.

06:34.480 --> 06:40.080
First job of the day,
my introductory piece to camera.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.880
OK, here we go. Action, Rory.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.080
But the Stinger isn't old school.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.920
Sorry. It IS old school!

07:10.920 --> 07:14.520
Three, two, one, action!

07:15.960 --> 07:17.480
But the Stinger ISN'T
a different take.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.680
It's old school. Good.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.520
Cool, mate. OK, cut.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.800
Right, enough of that.

07:35.080 --> 07:39.560
Now for the fun stuff.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.000
I'm in a Kia

08:00.320 --> 08:02.960
and quite enjoying it!

08:12.920 --> 08:14.320
OK, that went slightly wrong.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.360
It will do 168 miles...

08:38.320 --> 08:41.360
As soon as the Stinger hit
high speeds,

08:43.120 --> 08:45.920
it began to sound as though it had
developed what can only be described

08:46.480 --> 08:48.480
as, well, digestive issues.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.880
Was that you in there, Rory, or was
that the engine?

08:53.240 --> 08:57.560
I think that was the sunroof
flapping around at high speed.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.120
I think I need you going
a bit more full beans.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.760
Obviously when that vibration kicks
in, then slow a tickle.

09:13.360 --> 09:14.960
Let's just do one more, see what
happens.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.960
And action!

09:23.040 --> 09:25.160
Oh, this is quick!

09:35.560 --> 09:37.280
Yeah, that's definitely the sunroof.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.040
Oh, that's not right, is it?

10:04.040 --> 10:07.360
I've got something in the back
rattling around in here.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.760
I think it's our equipment.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.480
Mini cams.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.120
With so much equipment,

10:33.000 --> 10:37.200
it's inevitable that things
come loose from time to time,

10:41.680 --> 10:45.800
but with experts at hand
to make a few adjustments,

10:48.760 --> 10:53.240
we were ready to roll again.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.960
Well, almost.

11:03.720 --> 11:07.320
Why have you taken your shoe off?

11:10.560 --> 11:12.840
Why have I taken my shoe off?

11:15.480 --> 11:17.200
I'll let you in on a little secret,
shall I?

11:24.880 --> 11:27.080
This is my secret drifting
technique, to remove my shoe.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.520
I don't want to wear, like,
driving shoes, racing shoes,

11:33.760 --> 11:37.960
because they look rubbish.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.680
I want to wear stuff
I feel comfortable in.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.840
If you notice, the green is
co-ordinated

11:48.480 --> 11:51.080
very tightly with the green of my
jacket, OK?

11:54.480 --> 11:57.280
That's what I need to make me feel
good, so I take my shoe off so I can

11:59.000 --> 12:01.560
feel the pedal so it enables me to
judge how much power to apply.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.520
It's how I do it!

12:19.920 --> 12:22.760
All right, dude, let's get
you out there, and action!

12:32.200 --> 12:33.680
150!

12:41.400 --> 12:47.600
168mph!

12:50.200 --> 12:54.040
In a Kia!

13:03.160 --> 13:07.000
Finally, the Stinger could be
crossed off the shot list,

13:10.480 --> 13:14.320
but with the morning's rain and
technical issues,

13:17.600 --> 13:20.720
the crew were behind schedule.

13:22.680 --> 13:24.600
Thank you, guys, we've got to go.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.840
We were losing light and still had
the league table and the Hyundai

13:30.240 --> 13:32.320
to film. And with the league table
still in pieces...

13:41.800 --> 13:45.600
..it was a good job the i30 was
up to the task.

13:47.280 --> 13:50.000
Oh, yes, no problem!

13:52.320 --> 13:55.320
There's plenty of grip there.

13:57.160 --> 14:04.520
Turns in.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.960
Ha!

14:26.960 --> 14:28.000
Hyundai!

14:29.880 --> 14:32.120
Whoo!

14:40.560 --> 14:44.160
BLEEP me, that's fast.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.840
Needless to say,

15:01.560 --> 15:03.960
I was impressed, but there was one
more vehicle for me

15:06.640 --> 15:08.160
to get my hands on.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.960
This is the Niftylift HR12N
telescopic boom lift.

15:30.480 --> 15:31.920
It has a working height of
12 metres,

15:37.280 --> 15:40.000
fully proportional hydraulic
controls

15:42.840 --> 15:44.160
and a top speed of almost 2.1mph.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.360
It was here to help us build this,

16:00.360 --> 16:01.520
our seven-metre-tall

16:02.920 --> 16:05.800
fastest-car-building country
in the world

16:09.200 --> 16:11.880
leader board, the same one I was
going to have to get to the top of.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.239
Now, I don't know if you've ever
wondered about how to erect

16:16.240 --> 16:24.240
a Top Gear international league
table of countries

16:32.600 --> 16:37.600
that make the fastest cars,

16:39.280 --> 16:41.400
or TGILTOCTMTFC, for short, but
this is how you do it.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.400
You get a bunch of people who don't
know what they're doing,

16:47.840 --> 16:50.680
gather around a cherry picker,

16:53.920 --> 16:57.600
and then use a lot of brute force
and ignorance.

17:07.599 --> 17:11.760
Any minute now,
that's going to happen.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.480
Any minute.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.960
The longer I looked,
the taller it got.

17:31.520 --> 17:35.640
You all right with heights? Yeah.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.040
Well, we'll find out in a minute!

17:50.600 --> 17:52.360
Just step into that, like a...
like a jacket.

17:58.840 --> 18:02.080
I've seen these in the shops.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.800
Don't say what shop!

18:15.960 --> 18:17.800
Help!

18:23.640 --> 18:26.120
When the time came for me to
position South Korea on the board,

18:27.520 --> 18:30.080
there were merely minutes of
daylight left.

18:31.920 --> 18:34.240
We're probably only going to get
one take of this going up.

18:35.480 --> 18:38.280
It would have to be
a one-take wonder.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.080
Highly precarious.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.280
We don't need Australia.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.760
You know what, we don't need
Spain, either.

19:01.720 --> 19:04.240
South Korea, well done, you.

19:10.880 --> 19:14.840
In your face, Spain!

19:18.200 --> 19:20.000
You know where they don't take
siestas?

19:26.480 --> 19:30.840
South Korea.

19:40.760 --> 19:43.080
I'm not doing that again.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.760
Thank you, guys. Well done.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.440
Thank you, Rory.
Well done, everybody.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.720
It's a wrap. Come on.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.960
Right, how do I get down?

20:20.960 --> 20:23.160
I'm serious. How do I get down?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.520
Now, this is a pretty big deal
for Kia

20:37.600 --> 20:39.280
and I was actually more impressed

20:40.920 --> 20:43.720
than I thought I would be, and these
guys are claiming that the Stinger

20:47.240 --> 20:52.480
is going to compete with the likes
of BMW and Mercedes,

20:55.520 --> 20:59.680
and now that Hyundai
are doing so well in rallying,

21:01.480 --> 21:04.040
I'm guessing we can expect to see
more Korean manufacturers maybe

21:05.320 --> 21:08.040
taking part in touring car
championships.

21:11.440 --> 21:15.800
It looks that way.

21:17.320 --> 21:20.040
You know, we had the Hyundai i30

21:21.840 --> 21:27.000
making its introduction to World
Touring Cars last year. You know,

21:28.680 --> 21:31.360
global championship, and it actually
won on its debut, so, you know,

21:32.480 --> 21:34.080
if the race car can win,

21:36.240 --> 21:39.001
I suppose it shows it highlights how
good it can be as a road car and,

21:41.040 --> 21:44.000
yeah, I think we're going to see
more and more of it.

21:45.480 --> 21:47.720
Would you buy it?
A rear-wheel drive Kia, personally?

21:49.920 --> 21:53.160
Not yet, no. I do like my BMWs,
so...

21:57.320 --> 22:01.720
We know BMW are paying you but you
can talk about other manufacturers
as well!

22:05.000 --> 22:06.720
You know, I'm also into my pick-ups
as well.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.760
Really? Yeah. I like my pick-ups,
you know,

22:13.080 --> 22:16.600
and since I passed my driving test,
you know, obviously getting...

22:23.240 --> 22:24.960
You make that sound like it's just
happened.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.320
Ever since I didn't have that
provisional!

22:31.920 --> 22:35.240
It did take me a couple of goes,
to be fair.

22:37.320 --> 22:40.520
But, yeah, you know, I wanted to be
in something rear-wheel drive and,

22:42.320 --> 22:44.560
you know, a luxury sports car was
well outside the range,

22:45.600 --> 22:47.840
so I thought, you know, I can get
myself a cheap pick-up,

22:48.960 --> 22:53.080
it's rear-wheel drive,
and have some fun.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.760
It is alarming that you just said
it took you a couple

22:58.720 --> 23:05.160
of goes to pass your test.

23:07.920 --> 23:11.640
How many did it take?

23:15.200 --> 23:18.120
Well, twice.

23:19.800 --> 23:22.720
It took two goes, and, yeah, failed
the first time for speeding, so...

23:26.040 --> 23:28.600
Oh, right. Ready-made racing driver!

23:30.120 --> 23:32.000
Yeah. As a racing driver, it's not
a bad excuse.
