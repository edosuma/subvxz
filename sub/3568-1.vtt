<i>On December 31st,
two thousand fourteen,</i>

01:05.491 --> 01:08.572
<i>a taxi cab traveled
through San Francisco,</i>

01:09.293 --> 01:12.707
<i>from Chinatown to Marin.</i>

01:14.730 --> 01:18.019
<i>The car carried a single passenger,</i>

01:18.109 --> 01:23.254
<i>a woman, her birth name,
Adaline Bowman,</i>

01:26.050 --> 01:29.510
<i>current alias, Jennifer Larson.</i>

01:30.052 --> 01:35.072
<i>This is the first and last
chapter of her story.</i>

01:47.637 --> 01:51.784
Sorry, ya just gotta be quiet, my dad,
he's still sleeping, he works nights.

01:52.048 --> 01:53.347
C'mon in.

02:00.811 --> 02:05.151
<i>I... uh... finished the color SAP
and the digital printing last night.</i>

02:05.222 --> 02:09.056
<i>I pulled some line art
from the internet,</i>

02:09.199 --> 02:10.883
and printed the imperfections.

02:10.936 --> 02:14.257
See, that's kinda my secret,
the dust marks and the discoloration.

02:14.309 --> 02:16.902
No one's gonna question
that detail in a million years.

02:18.648 --> 02:22.692
<i>So, why 29? I mean, if I
were you, shave a coupla</i>

02:22.718 --> 02:26.681
years off, you could
 definitely get away with...

02:27.756 --> 02:29.880
You're very kind, Tony.

02:31.246 --> 02:32.833
Nice work.

02:33.169 --> 02:35.803
It's a pleasure doing business with you. If
you any of your friends ever need anything...

02:35.903 --> 02:37.830
- Why are you doing this?
- Come again?

02:37.930 --> 02:40.053
You're a smart kid, forgery's a felony.

02:40.103 --> 02:43.079
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine,
six years in jail.

02:44.052 --> 02:46.385
Shit, you're... you're a cop?

02:47.228 --> 02:50.320
No, I'm about as far from law
enforcement as you can get.

02:50.925 --> 02:53.930
I just hate to see wasted potential, Jeff.

02:54.260 --> 02:55.137
Tony. It's Tony.

02:55.187 --> 02:59.262
The autographed baseballs in
your bedroom... made out to Jeff.

02:59.313 --> 03:02.787
Don't get sloppy,
it's the little things that trip you up.

03:27.858 --> 03:29.535
Honey, I'm home.

03:37.456 --> 03:38.918
Reese?

03:42.095 --> 03:43.632
Hi!

03:59.453 --> 04:01.168
There we go.

04:02.113 --> 04:04.671
<i>You're gonna love the new farm house.</i>

04:04.721 --> 04:08.775
Clean air, acres and acres of woods,
a mountain stream.

04:09.093 --> 04:10.916
You'll feel like a puppy again.

04:12.227 --> 04:16.699
Did you know that your great, great,
grandmother was born just a few towns over?

04:16.761 --> 04:19.088
So was mine,
not at the same time, of course.

04:20.385 --> 04:24.158
Oh, I gotta go to work.

04:26.108 --> 04:29.347
- Civic Archives, please.
- It may take a while, Market's jammed.

04:29.397 --> 04:31.479
Okay, then please take
California to Hyde.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.124
There's construction on Hyde.

04:33.174 --> 04:36.160
Why don't you stay on this,
take this to Golf, Golf to Bush, Bush to.

04:36.305 --> 04:39.477
Polk, Polk to Grove, and then just
leave me on the corner of Market.

04:40.634 --> 04:43.416
- You want my job?
- You never know.

05:03.066 --> 05:04.670
- Morning, Jennie.
- Morning.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.033
- Morning.
- Hi, Kenneth.

05:06.083 --> 05:09.671
We thought you might not be coming in
today, being New Year's Eve, and all.

05:09.721 --> 05:14.102
Well, it's still a Wednesday,
the fun doesn't start 'til tonight anyway.

05:14.194 --> 05:16.876
Well, are you up for a
little excitement right now?

05:16.902 --> 05:18.035
Sure, what is it?

05:18.083 --> 05:21.608
Your favorite, the newsreel archive,
it's finally being digitized.

05:21.658 --> 05:24.535
We need a little help getting
it ready to be shipped.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.378
I'd love to.

06:47.712 --> 06:53.394
<i>Adaline Marie Bowman was born at twelve-oh-one
a.m., January 1st. Nineteen-oh-eight,</i>

06:53.444 --> 06:56.910
<i>at Children's Hospital, San Francisco,</i>

07:00.447 --> 07:03.454
<i>the only child of Faye and Milton Bowman,</i>

07:08.642 --> 07:16.070
<i>On June 16th, 1929, just as Adaline Bowman and
her mother stopped to admire the expanse,</i>

07:16.120 --> 07:21.711
<i>where three years hence construction would
be finished on the Golden Gate Bridge,</i>

07:21.861 --> 07:26.491
<i>a young engineer displayed
uncommon gallantry.</i>

07:35.014 --> 07:40.780
<i>Eighty-seven days later Adaline
married Clarence James Prescott,</i>

07:40.830 --> 07:44.834
<i>at Old Saint Mary's
Cathedral in San Francisco.</i>

07:47.792 --> 07:52.888
<i>Three years later Adaline
gave birth to a baby girl.</i>

07:53.274 --> 07:58.541
<i>They named her Fleming,
after Adaline's paternal grandmother.</i>

07:59.603 --> 08:05.965
<i>On February 17th, 1937 eight workers and two
engineers lost their lives when a section</i>

08:06.015 --> 08:10.838
<i>of scaffolding fell through a safety net
during construction of the Golden Gate Bridge.</i>

08:11.675 --> 08:15.221
<i>Among the deceased was Adaline's husband.</i>

08:23.050 --> 08:28.576
<i>Ten months after her husband's death
Adaline was driving north to her</i>

08:28.665 --> 08:34.561
<i>parents beach cottage where 5 year
old Fleming was waiting up for her,</i>

08:35.933 --> 08:42.832
<i>when something highly unusual occurred,
something almost magical...</i>

08:47.630 --> 08:51.684
<i>snow fell in Sonoma County, California.</i>

09:26.368 --> 09:32.147
<i>The immersion in the frigid water
caused Adaline's body to go into an</i>

09:32.235 --> 09:40.033
<i>anoxic reflex, instantly stopping her
breathing and slowing her heartbeat.</i>

09:41.396 --> 09:45.203
<i>Within 2 minutes,
Adaline Bowman's core temperature</i>

09:45.394 --> 09:53.402
<i>had dropped to 87 degrees...
her heart stopped beating.</i>

10:00.100 --> 10:07.616
<i>At 8:55 a bolt of lightning struck
the vehicle discharging half a</i>

10:07.666 --> 10:12.909
<i>billion volts of electricity and
producing 60,000 amperes of current.</i>

10:12.959 --> 10:15.453
<i>Its effect was threefold.</i>

10:17.305 --> 10:21.229
<i>First, the charge defibrillated
Adaline Bowman's heart.</i>

10:23.434 --> 10:28.089
<i>Second,
she was jolted out of her anoxic state</i>

10:28.139 --> 10:33.086
<i>causing her to draw her
first breath in 2 minutes.</i>

10:46.966 --> 10:50.142
<i>Third, based on Von Lehman's principle of</i>

10:50.214 --> 10:53.968
<i>electron compression in
deoxyribonucleic acid,</i>

10:54.018 --> 10:57.693
<i>which will be discovered in the
year two thousand thirty-five,</i>

10:57.968 --> 11:03.712
<i>Adaline Bowman will henceforth be
immune to the ravages of time...</i>

11:03.763 --> 11:08.976
<i>she will never age another day.</i>

11:34.704 --> 11:37.848
<i>As the years passed,
Adaline credited her unchanging</i>

11:37.898 --> 11:40.700
<i>appearance to a combination
of a healthy diet,</i>

11:40.727 --> 11:43.262
<i>exercise, heredity, and good luck.</i>

11:43.363 --> 11:47.962
- Adaline?
- Miriam, hello.

11:48.062 --> 11:52.082
- My god, you haven't changed a bit.
- Oh, that's very kind of you to say.

11:52.182 --> 11:54.031
Fleming, you're all grown up.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.574
That's what I keep telling my mom,
but she doesn't believe me.

11:57.053 --> 12:00.714
I'm sorry we really must leave.
But you... you look like sisters.

12:00.814 --> 12:02.800
You better stop or it'll
go straight to my head.

12:02.900 --> 12:06.205
- How is that possible?
- A new face cream... from Paris.

12:06.306 --> 12:08.768
Made from the royal
jelly of the queen bee.

12:08.794 --> 12:11.592
Okay, Darling, bye-bye
now, great seeing you.

12:17.437 --> 12:22.828
<i>Action was required... just weeks later,
when living a quiet suburban existence,</i>

12:22.928 --> 12:26.860
<i>Adaline was pulled over for
a minor traffic infraction.</i>

12:28.138 --> 12:31.981
Ma'am it says here you were
born January 1st., 1908.

12:33.499 --> 12:34.646
That's right.

12:34.746 --> 12:40.374
- That would make you... 45 years old?
- Yes.

12:40.474 --> 12:42.372
Ma'am, I'm gonna hold onto this.

12:42.472 --> 12:46.354
When you come by the station house to pick
it up, please bring your birth certificate.

12:46.454 --> 12:50.410
I'd be happy to, Officer,
is tomorrow morning all right?

12:50.510 --> 12:52.151
Sure.

12:54.764 --> 13:01.725
<i>Soon after, Adaline moved back to San Francisco and
took a clerical job at the School of Medicine.</i>

13:07.295 --> 13:13.745
<i>There, she availed herself of every
opportunity to research her condition.</i>

13:18.722 --> 13:24.309
<i>After a year of intense study,
Adaline Bowman was forced to confront the</i>

13:24.359 --> 13:29.641
<i>fact that there was absolutely no
scientific explanation for her condition.</i>

13:29.741 --> 13:36.274
<i>Are you a member of the communist party or have
you ever been a member of the communist party?</i>

13:46.015 --> 13:47.505
Adaline?

13:49.418 --> 13:51.679
I'm sorry, you have the wrong person.

13:51.779 --> 13:55.114
We're from the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, Miss Bowman.

13:56.539 --> 13:58.742
We'd like to ask you a few questions,
if you don't mind.

13:58.786 --> 14:01.378
Why, I've done nothing wrong.

14:02.144 --> 14:05.428
I'm a good American, how dare you
bother me at my place of employment.

14:05.528 --> 14:06.747
It couldn't be helped, Ma'am.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.884
We have no record of your residence.
This way please.

14:16.544 --> 14:21.633
Nothing to worry about, Miss Bowman,
we're just going to run a few tests on you.

15:28.449 --> 15:34.861
If anyone contacts you, tell them that I went
to Europe on vacation, that I never came back.

15:35.743 --> 15:38.753
The next time we see each other,
I'll have a new identity.

15:39.852 --> 15:44.273
I'll always be your mother, you'll just
have to introduce me as your friend.

15:44.374 --> 15:50.205
- Mama, no.
- It has to be this way... here.

16:01.208 --> 16:07.855
<i>To insure the freedom and safety of herself and
her daughter Adaline vowed to keep moving,</i>

16:09.782 --> 16:15.216
<i>changing her name, residence,
and appearance every decade,</i>

16:17.282 --> 16:24.740
<i>and never to speak a word of
her fate to another living soul.</i>

16:32.261 --> 16:35.915
<i>In seven weeks,
when Jennifer Larson disappears forever,</i>

16:36.876 --> 16:41.791
<i>and Susan Fleisher takes up residence
in a remote farmhouse in Ashton, Oregon,</i>

16:44.003 --> 16:48.308
<i>Adaline Bowman,
beside one moment of weakness.</i>

16:49.098 --> 16:52.021
<i>Will have kept her vow
for the past 60 years.</i>

17:04.454 --> 17:05.744
Hello, Regan.

17:05.865 --> 17:08.308
<i>Amanda, you're not going
to stand me up, are you?</i>

17:08.428 --> 17:11.270
You asked me that last year,
why don't you trust me?

17:11.351 --> 17:13.693
Oh, I just can't believe you
haven't got a better offer.

17:13.762 --> 17:14.763
<i>Impossible.</i>

17:14.844 --> 17:15.998
I'll pick you up eight?

17:16.023 --> 17:18.483
Actually, that's the
other reason I called.

17:18.558 --> 17:22.251
<i>The Grand Hotel of Nob Hill
is sending a</i> car for me.

17:22.362 --> 17:24.674
- Look at you.
- Have you ever been there for New Years?

17:24.784 --> 17:26.826
Only once, ages ago.

17:26.935 --> 17:28.428
<i>I guess it's pretty lavish.</i>

17:29.479 --> 17:32.131
Well, I better get to it then,
I'll see you soon.

17:32.912 --> 17:33.913
<i>Bye, Regan.</i>

17:54.534 --> 17:55.585
Are you hungry?

17:58.077 --> 17:59.078
No?

18:00.119 --> 18:02.902
<i>Oh, you just want to come out
with me</i> tonight, don't you?

18:02.972 --> 18:05.014
Sorry, buddy, it's a girls night.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.750
Avery, if you do not remove the hand
my knee...

18:40.850 --> 18:43.082
My two hands are on
the table, Adaline.

19:23.022 --> 19:24.023
Thank you.

19:25.575 --> 19:27.917
- Happy New Year.
- Oh! Hey, Amanda.

19:28.027 --> 19:30.840
- That was you clapping, wasn't it?
- How did you guess?

19:31.561 --> 19:34.013
- You've got manners.
- We're the last two.

19:34.544 --> 19:36.095
Hey, grab a glass.

19:36.826 --> 19:38.338
Tell me, what did I miss?

19:38.408 --> 19:40.600
Oh, not much, just some happy chatter.

19:40.710 --> 19:42.452
It's funny, no matter how old you get,

19:42.562 --> 19:46.085
New Year's Eve still feels like the
one night where anything's possible.

19:46.205 --> 19:47.577
What's your resolution?

19:47.647 --> 19:50.890
Same as always, true love.
How about you?

19:51.611 --> 19:54.243
To live this year as
though it were my last.

19:54.253 --> 19:56.295
Well, you never know,
it could be, at our age.

19:56.836 --> 19:59.288
So, Helia, let's live.

20:03.082 --> 20:06.075
Beware, bachelor at three o'clock,
we need to stir him up.

20:06.185 --> 20:07.266
What's he like?

20:07.387 --> 20:09.609
Brown hair, icy blues,
mid-30's.

20:09.719 --> 20:12.001
How many with you who is
kicking out my babies?

20:12.071 --> 20:12.972
He's here.

20:13.052 --> 20:15.645
- Good evening, ladies.
- Welcome to Cougartown.

20:15.755 --> 20:19.879
I know, we don't look a day over 28,
you're too kind. What's your name?

20:19.999 --> 20:22.121
- Dale... Davenport.
- Dale's a painter.

20:22.231 --> 20:23.953
- Really?
- Yeah, a starving artist, though.

20:23.963 --> 20:26.466
<i>Because he doesn't accept</i>
his affluent family's help.

20:26.536 --> 20:28.087
I... I'm sorry, have we met?

20:28.197 --> 20:31.871
No, no, no, just your Cartier wrist watch,
one of the very first.

20:31.991 --> 20:35.365
I'm assuming it was given to you by
a well to do grandfather.

20:36.195 --> 20:38.688
A great-grandfather,
but how do you know I paint?

20:38.798 --> 20:41.961
You hands are covered in paint.
<i>That one was easy.</i>

20:43.573 --> 20:46.676
Well, Picasso, have a seat,
we're gonna buy you a drink.

20:47.533 --> 20:48.534
Sure.

20:48.558 --> 20:50.550
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

20:50.660 --> 20:51.661
Thank you.

21:28.368 --> 21:31.199
<i>Six, five, four...</i>

21:31.301 --> 21:34.043
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

21:34.073 --> 21:37.312
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

21:39.809 --> 21:40.830
Hello.

21:41.371 --> 21:43.423
Thank you, Sweetheart.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.287
No, no, you don't have to sing.

21:48.398 --> 21:50.910
Please, please, don't sing,
I've already had enough birthdays.

21:53.082 --> 21:54.083
Where are you?

21:55.645 --> 21:57.296
You didn't go out at all?

21:58.358 --> 22:00.430
Well, I don't blame you.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.422
Are we still on for tomorrow?

22:03.222 --> 22:06.396
Great, all right, get some sleep.
I love you.

22:07.056 --> 22:08.097
Good night.

22:19.529 --> 22:21.971
Whoever he is,
I hope he has one helluva an excuse.

22:22.121 --> 22:23.893
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

22:24.754 --> 22:26.636
It's just...
isn't there some sort of tradition.

22:26.776 --> 22:30.219
If you're alone on New Year Eve that
you're supposed to kiss a stranger?

22:31.711 --> 22:33.733
Damn it, you've heard it before.

22:33.843 --> 22:38.656
Just once, from a young
Bing Crosby... type.

22:39.218 --> 22:40.219
Happy New Year.

22:48.688 --> 22:52.141
- I am too old for this.
- Oh, no, don't disappear.

22:52.221 --> 22:54.704
I'll call you tomorrow and you can tell
me everything I missed. I love you.

22:54.714 --> 22:56.215
Bye, Beautiful.

23:09.459 --> 23:12.091
That'll teach me not to put my
hand where it doesn't belong.

23:12.922 --> 23:14.044
Something tells me it won't.

23:16.356 --> 23:19.883
You know, that was a risky move.

23:19.933 --> 23:20.527
What was?

23:20.553 --> 23:22.927
Not introducing yourself
before you leave.

23:23.873 --> 23:24.884
I'm a daredevil.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.408
I'm Ellis, a pleasure to meet you.

23:28.518 --> 23:31.591
- Like the Island?
- No man is.

23:32.462 --> 23:33.463
I'm Jenny.

23:33.983 --> 23:34.984
The poem?

23:37.182 --> 23:39.617
No?
"Say I'm weary, say I'm sad,".

23:39.729 --> 23:43.583
"Say that health and wealth have miss'd me,
Say I'm growing old, but add,."

23:43.883 --> 23:46.581
"Jenny kissed me."

23:50.239 --> 23:51.331
Who wrote that?

23:51.441 --> 23:54.754
- Oh, one of the romantics, I think.
- No, you're not sure.

23:55.545 --> 23:59.929
Actually, I am, but I don't want
to come across like a know-it-all.

24:00.049 --> 24:02.902
Too bad, Henri, I adore know-it-alls.

24:07.347 --> 24:09.258
So, where are you off to?

24:10.029 --> 24:12.842
Some place better food...
my apartment.

24:14.293 --> 24:15.294
And yourself?

24:16.135 --> 24:20.580
Back to the party.
I just wanted to spend 27 floors with you.

24:21.050 --> 24:23.933
- Well, that was a risky move.
- What?

24:24.624 --> 24:27.617
Leaving your date upstairs.
I hope it was worth it.

24:27.727 --> 24:28.830
What are you talking about?

24:28.856 --> 24:30.815
Oh, come on, that
beautiful woman in blue.

24:30.940 --> 24:33.473
Does her name happen to end in "kova"?

24:34.484 --> 24:38.338
No, her name is Agnes Boggs.

24:38.448 --> 24:40.970
Her uncle's the chef,
I'll let him know you liked his food.

24:42.602 --> 24:43.903
And she's not my date.

24:50.410 --> 24:53.060
- Taxi, Ma'am?
- Yes, please, thank you.

24:57.927 --> 24:59.008
Good night.

25:01.170 --> 25:02.291
I'll just wait with you.

25:02.402 --> 25:04.514
So you can find out where I live?

25:06.185 --> 25:08.267
It does make it a lot
easier to send flowers.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.812
Thank you, but I'll manage.

25:15.485 --> 25:18.007
Goodbye, it's been an
adventure meeting you.

25:21.351 --> 25:22.612
Thank you.

25:24.684 --> 25:25.685
Wait!

25:27.156 --> 25:30.570
There you go again, putting your
hand in places it doesn't belong.

25:32.171 --> 25:35.912
- How do we get in touch?
- Happy New Year, Ellis.

25:36.306 --> 25:37.567
Thank you, Sir.

26:02.051 --> 26:04.674
- Am I late?
- No more than usual.

26:05.695 --> 26:06.776
Happy Birthday, Mama.

26:07.697 --> 26:08.698
Thank you, Darling.

26:11.401 --> 26:13.413
I'm so happy to see you.

26:17.457 --> 26:19.519
You know you don't have
to still give me cards.

26:21.821 --> 26:24.634
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

26:26.118 --> 26:29.389
- So, when you are moving back up?
- The third week in February.

26:29.499 --> 26:31.260
- Right on schedule.
- Of course.

26:38.057 --> 26:40.357
I see you already forgot our
little talk about sodium.

26:40.990 --> 26:43.623
No, I am simply choosing to ignore it.

26:46.946 --> 26:52.562
Actually, I'm thinking of moving, myself.

26:54.514 --> 26:55.995
But you love where you live.

26:56.175 --> 26:59.128
I do, but, you know,
there's just too many stairs.

26:59.779 --> 27:05.284
Last week Kay Alfonso fell,
and she broke her hip.

27:05.365 --> 27:08.498
The doctor said she might
never leave the hospital.

27:10.269 --> 27:13.933
And the very next day,
Molly Andrews called me,

27:14.013 --> 27:19.569
and she told me about this wonderful
retirement community in Arizona.

27:19.639 --> 27:23.515
She moved in last spring. She said she's
never been happier in her whole life.

27:27.437 --> 27:28.588
What's a matter?

27:31.010 --> 27:34.113
We bought in Oregon so
that I could be close to you.

27:34.944 --> 27:36.456
You could come up for long visits,

27:36.566 --> 27:38.618
move in with me eventually.

27:40.330 --> 27:43.713
We haven't lived together
since I was in high school.

27:43.863 --> 27:46.486
A little bit.
You're not getting any younger.

27:47.367 --> 27:50.249
What if you move to Arizona
and something happened to you?

27:50.350 --> 27:51.351
What if you get sick?

27:52.131 --> 27:55.305
Then, I would hope that you'd
come and take care of me.

27:59.389 --> 28:00.663
What if I'm too late?

28:00.810 --> 28:07.507
No, no, we cannot do this,
not on your birthday, it's a holiday.

28:13.543 --> 28:16.606
I nearly fell off my feet.

28:16.706 --> 28:18.220
What are you two clucking about?

28:18.358 --> 28:21.272
Major news!
Mr. Jones is donating fifty thousand

28:21.323 --> 28:24.283
dollars worth of first edition
classics to this library.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.616
- What books, do you know?
- We're going to find out very soon,

28:26.696 --> 28:31.130
because his office called to say
that he'll be here to deliver them himself.

28:32.512 --> 28:34.944
- Hi.
- Oh no. - I'm Ellis. - Oh, good.

28:34.984 --> 28:37.135
- Welcome, - Thanks.
- Mr. Jones.

28:37.185 --> 28:40.365
On behalf of the San
Francisco Heritage Society

28:40.415 --> 28:44.923
I'd like to express our sincere
gratitude for your most generous gift.

28:45.014 --> 28:47.627
I left them in Shipping and Receiving,
but I'm sure they'll be right up.

28:47.707 --> 28:51.230
If you don't mind, we'd like
a photograph of you donating the books.

28:51.301 --> 28:52.432
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

28:53.192 --> 28:54.714
Can you give me one second, though?

28:57.327 --> 29:02.081
Hey, it's me, the know-it-all.

29:02.732 --> 29:05.725
- What are you doing here?
- I got something for you, too.

29:07.537 --> 29:08.658
Some flowers.

29:10.820 --> 29:13.343
<u>Daisy Miller</u> by Henry James.

29:13.453 --> 29:15.905
<u>Dandelion Wine</u> by Ray Bradbury.

29:16.626 --> 29:18.728
<u>White Oleander</u>, Janet Fitch.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.940
Very clever.

29:25.114 --> 29:27.166
How did you know I work here?

29:27.276 --> 29:30.620
I just joined the Board,
I saw you coming out of our meeting.

29:31.741 --> 29:33.793
You could have mentioned
that in the elevator.

29:37.216 --> 29:41.751
If we'd met in a taller building,
I'd of had time to cover that.

29:45.725 --> 29:49.399
I don't know about you, but...
I'm ready for some donating.

29:50.340 --> 29:52.211
Great, I'll be here.

29:52.251 --> 29:55.805
No way, I'd like for you to accept
books on behalf of the Library.

29:55.925 --> 29:58.388
- Oh, no, I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

29:58.458 --> 30:00.780
No, I... I don't want my photo taken.

30:00.890 --> 30:02.462
Don't worry, you look stunning.

30:02.582 --> 30:05.785
It's not about vanity, I just don't
like people taking my photograph.

30:08.318 --> 30:11.811
Suit yourself, if you won't accept them,
I won't donate 'em.

30:11.931 --> 30:15.785
- You wouldn't do that.
- I will, I'll even have a book burning.

30:18.207 --> 30:22.313
I just... I don't like having
my photos taken, Ellis.

30:23.903 --> 30:26.496
Okay, fine, fine. Here's an alternative.

30:27.957 --> 30:29.238
Let me take you out tomorrow.

30:31.841 --> 30:34.764
Okay... that's impossible.

30:41.010 --> 30:43.503
All right, well, I'll just pack
up the books then, that's fine.

30:47.086 --> 30:48.669
Where?

30:52.031 --> 30:53.833
Some place you've never been.

30:55.074 --> 30:57.847
Well, if it's in this city,
that's unlikely.

30:59.128 --> 31:00.558
Try me.

31:02.752 --> 31:04.915
<i>You can leave your boots at
the front when you're done,</i>

31:04.944 --> 31:07.370
- I'll be right outside.
- We will, thank you, Tom.

31:07.457 --> 31:08.558
All right.

31:12.552 --> 31:14.854
All right... I give up.

31:17.026 --> 31:22.612
In the first year of the Gold Rush, about
60,000 people came to San Francisco by ship.

31:22.722 --> 31:26.606
And a lot of them hightailed straight
into the hills leaving their boats behind.

31:27.226 --> 31:30.259
Hundreds of boats were left onshore.

31:30.950 --> 31:34.654
Downtown San Francisco was
built right on top of them.

31:34.764 --> 31:35.765
I didn't know that.

31:36.145 --> 31:41.841
Now... City Services found this when they were
digging when they were digging for a utility line.

31:43.393 --> 31:47.293
- My God.
- Isn't it something?

31:48.378 --> 31:50.820
- Is... is that...?
- Yeah, that's a boat.

31:51.381 --> 31:55.885
Oh! Wow! This is incredible.

31:56.005 --> 31:58.820
So, we had the digging stopped immediately,
of course, because

31:58.870 --> 32:01.481
we want this made
available to the public.

32:01.551 --> 32:02.277
- "We"

32:02.304 --> 32:05.207
- San Francisco Historical
Preservation Society.

32:05.284 --> 32:07.317
Oh, let me guess, you're on the board.

32:07.397 --> 32:10.580
Yeah, well, they'll...
they'll let anyone on the Board these days.

32:18.988 --> 32:22.151
So, how did you come by
your fortune, anyway... inheritance?

32:22.912 --> 32:27.096
Luck.
I was a math major in college, and

32:27.176 --> 32:31.030
in my spare time I developed an
algorithm for analyzing climate data,

32:31.711 --> 32:36.446
but my roommate figured out that it could
also be used to make economic forecasts.

32:36.556 --> 32:39.068
So he started a company in our dorm room,

32:39.148 --> 32:43.573
<i>sold it 3 years later and then
with his half he retired to Fiji.</i>

32:43.683 --> 32:46.896
And with my half, I'm...
ya know, I'm doing this.

32:46.966 --> 32:49.098
Your... your job is giving away money.

32:49.208 --> 32:52.632
Yeah, that's right, but... but if you want to
make a real difference in this world, it's a...

32:52.742 --> 32:55.585
it's a lot harder than it seems.

32:58.197 --> 33:00.099
What about you, Jenny?

33:06.125 --> 33:08.137
I own a dog.

33:10.019 --> 33:11.020
Well.

33:11.641 --> 33:13.072
I should be getting back.

33:13.663 --> 33:14.974
I thought we were having lunch.

33:16.225 --> 33:19.779
It's too late, Ellis,
I only have an hour.

33:23.993 --> 33:25.865
Let me at least walk you back.

33:30.640 --> 33:34.974
Thank you for all of this, but..
But you should know I'm moving.

33:41.260 --> 33:45.835
I have an idea.
I'll tell you a joke, and if you laugh,

33:46.646 --> 33:49.268
you have to go out with me
one more again before you move away.

33:49.349 --> 33:53.743
And if you don't laugh, I'll know we're
incompatible and I'll gladly give up.

33:53.853 --> 33:57.317
- That must be one helluva joke.
- It's the funniest in human history.

33:57.387 --> 34:01.391
But it's subtle, sophisticated,
so you probably won't even get it.

34:02.041 --> 34:03.192
Yeah, probably not.

34:04.143 --> 34:05.144
Do you like baseball?

34:05.805 --> 34:07.997
- Yeah, I love it.
- Good. So...

34:09.178 --> 34:14.484
One day at Fenway Park,
Ted Williams... Do you know who he was?

34:14.563 --> 34:18.885
Oh, c'mon, the Thumper,
current batting average .344, right?

34:18.935 --> 34:21.331
What? Yeah, that Ted Williams.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.743
Anyway, so, he's hangin' around Fenway and

34:23.862 --> 34:26.766
this horse walks up and says,
"I want to play for the Sox."

34:26.766 --> 34:28.808
- An actual horse?
- An actual horse.

34:28.947 --> 34:30.969
Ted's like, "Okay, what can you do?"

34:31.070 --> 34:33.943
And the horse says, "I can hit just
like you, only a whole lot better ".

34:34.053 --> 34:38.007
So, he picks up the bat with
his teeth and Ted's like, "Okay",

34:38.257 --> 34:40.219
and he throws him a few,
and sure enough...

34:40.849 --> 34:41.650
goong, goong, goong!

34:43.212 --> 34:44.263
Into the bleachers.

34:45.103 --> 34:48.808
So, Ted's like,
"Whoa! What else can you do?"

34:48.878 --> 34:51.020
And the horse says,
"Well, I can play shortstop."

34:51.030 --> 34:54.387
So, Ted hits him a few
ground balls and sure enough.

34:54.487 --> 34:56.386
He's a "vacuum cleaner"?

34:57.554 --> 35:01.050
Yeah, so Ted's like,
"Whoa! Can you pitch?"

35:01.130 --> 35:02.733
And the horse just
looks at him and says,

35:02.832 --> 35:06.356
"Pitch? Who ever heard
of a horse pitching?"

35:12.572 --> 35:14.930
Yeah! Yes!

35:14.954 --> 35:19.989
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Lady has been conquered.

35:21.361 --> 35:24.213
That's the worst joke I've
ever heard in my entire life.

35:24.324 --> 35:26.275
- Thank you.
- It wasn't a compliment.

35:26.666 --> 35:29.949
Dinner, Tuesday, my place, 303-18th Street.

35:31.401 --> 35:32.402
Eight o'clock.

35:34.599 --> 35:35.834
Fine.

35:46.666 --> 35:48.828
<i>Good morning, Miss Larson,
good to see you again.</i>

35:48.908 --> 35:51.451
<i>- Good morning.
- So, what can we do for you today?</i>

35:51.571 --> 35:53.643
I'd like to add another
signee to my account.

35:53.753 --> 35:57.176
- May I ask the reason?
- I'll be traveling for a while.

35:57.867 --> 35:59.028
Traveling, huh?

35:59.759 --> 36:03.052
Okay, I'll get the paperwork,
I'll be right back.

36:17.377 --> 36:19.919
All of these companies
rate very highly with us.

36:20.029 --> 36:22.101
What's this, the Haloid
Photographic Company?

36:22.171 --> 36:25.024
They've been around 50 years,
they make photo paper and equipment.

36:25.154 --> 36:28.057
They're developing something called
"electro photography".

36:28.117 --> 36:31.741
Could revolutionize the business,
but you won't see any immediate returns.

36:31.821 --> 36:34.023
- Could be a few years away.
- That's all right.

36:34.754 --> 36:36.586
I'd hate to see you tie up your money.

36:37.307 --> 36:38.608
I'm patient.

36:39.549 --> 36:41.190
What do you know,
they changed their name.

36:41.591 --> 36:42.602
They're now called...

36:45.004 --> 36:47.377
What the heck, it starts
with an "X", it's...

36:48.037 --> 36:50.310
It's Greek, it's pronounced "XEROX".

36:51.260 --> 36:52.662
Xerox.

36:54.083 --> 36:57.327
<i>So, we can start with the signature card.</i>

36:58.848 --> 37:01.511
- What is the name of the co-signer?
- Susan Fleisher.

37:01.631 --> 37:07.086
- Susan, what, F-I-e...
- I-s-h-e-r.

37:09.719 --> 37:11.040
Now, I made you some salmon.

37:11.761 --> 37:16.005
This no eating nonsense just won't
do if you are a proper farm dog.

37:16.946 --> 37:20.089
I want you to eat every last bite,
do you understand me?

37:22.522 --> 37:25.274
Oh, there we go.

37:51.070 --> 37:54.634
Hello? Ellis?

37:59.399 --> 38:01.761
- Am I interrupting?
- Hey!

38:03.313 --> 38:07.066
- I was afraid you got cold feet.
- No, no, just trouble getting a cab.

38:07.837 --> 38:08.838
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:12.422 --> 38:13.923
Can I take your coat?

38:14.584 --> 38:15.706
Okay.

38:18.428 --> 38:21.722
Uh, your... your place it's, uh...

38:21.851 --> 38:23.973
- Unfinished?
- Yes!

38:24.053 --> 38:27.687
Uh, I noticed that part,
it's sort of an artistic choice?

38:28.644 --> 38:32.613
No, I have to paint and plaster
and do all the wiring stuff,

38:32.672 --> 38:37.867
but I'm doing it all myself, so,
it's gonna take a little while.

38:37.917 --> 38:39.939
- I think your food is burning.
- Ah!

38:44.138 --> 38:46.626
So, make yourself comfortable.

38:47.216 --> 38:48.428
<i>Sit down, relax.</i>

38:50.268 --> 38:51.302
Okay.

38:54.754 --> 38:57.857
What is it... that you're cooking?

38:58.418 --> 39:02.812
Well, it's a delicacy,
which to be honest, is not for everyone.

39:05.074 --> 39:06.376
I hope you like it.

39:08.127 --> 39:10.169
- Are you ready?
- Would you like a drum roll?

39:12.522 --> 39:13.523
<i>Voila!</i>

39:14.874 --> 39:17.467
It was between this
and stuffed quail.

39:17.907 --> 39:19.389
Please do not tell me
you're disappointed.

39:19.499 --> 39:22.932
- I... I'm truly overjoyed!
- Yes!

39:23.983 --> 39:25.395
- Dig in.
- Okay.

39:30.249 --> 39:31.034
Well?

39:31.060 --> 39:34.198
Well, it's perfect, just
the music is painful.

39:35.004 --> 39:38.418
- You don't like jazz?
- No, I love jazz, this is something else.

39:42.191 --> 39:45.795
My mom grew up in Maine,
she's is a real New Englander.

39:45.805 --> 39:48.658
Sweet, but tough as nails.

39:49.919 --> 39:55.975
My dad, on the other hand...
has his head in the stars... literally.

39:56.175 --> 39:59.569
He's an astronomer,
just retired from Stanford.

40:00.540 --> 40:04.083
His claim to fame was that he
discovered an unusual comet.

40:04.384 --> 40:06.224
Unusual, in what way?

40:06.326 --> 40:09.057
Well, it has a mathematically
proven perigee.

40:09.158 --> 40:14.041
So, based on his calculation, it will
pass by Earth in the winter of 1981.

40:14.644 --> 40:16.516
- Did it?
- No.

40:16.776 --> 40:23.386
No, it did not, but, that didn't stop
him from looking for it every year.

40:23.453 --> 40:26.617
It was a kind of ritual we
had when I was growing up.

40:27.887 --> 40:29.619
My dad is still looking.

40:33.132 --> 40:36.366
Well, one more glass of
wine and may see it.

40:38.518 --> 40:40.410
Oh, no, no, no thank you, please.

40:40.510 --> 40:43.442
Ah, c'mon, ya know, they
have a saying in Italy,

40:43.543 --> 40:47.387
Anni, amori e bicchieri di vino,
nun se contano mai.

40:48.217 --> 40:52.352
"Years, lovers, wine cups,"

40:52.932 --> 40:55.774
"years, lovers and glasses or wine,"

40:55.875 --> 40:58.448
"these are things that
should never be counted."

41:00.860 --> 41:02.231
You have no idea.

41:07.827 --> 41:12.782
- I like your view.
- Thank you.

41:14.894 --> 41:16.606
I like the way you read.

41:18.668 --> 41:19.669
What?

41:20.149 --> 41:23.793
The first time I saw you, coming out
of a board meeting, you were reading.

41:26.025 --> 41:29.939
Your hair was pulled back and
you were wearing a blue dress.

41:30.420 --> 41:33.812
It was a book in Braille.
I slowed down to watch.

41:33.913 --> 41:35.625
How long did you watch for?

41:35.825 --> 41:38.247
Long enough to realize
you weren't blind.

41:39.208 --> 41:40.770
And I had to meet you.

41:41.270 --> 41:45.244
And I didn't know when
or how, but I... I knew I would.

41:55.875 --> 41:56.996
I think I, uh...

41:58.488 --> 42:00.069
I think I remember that day, uh...

42:02.322 --> 42:05.335
Yes, it was a... it was
a book in Norwegian,

42:05.345 --> 42:07.533
and because of all the
umlauts over the vowels,

42:07.559 --> 42:09.564
it made it nearly
impossible to comprehend.

42:10.780 --> 42:13.157
- You're kidding.
- Yes.

42:13.493 --> 42:15.565
- Are you kidding?
- Yes, yes of course I am.

42:16.786 --> 42:20.890
It was Braille for beginners,
or nursery rhymes or something.

42:27.989 --> 42:30.201
You could tell me anything
you want and I'll believe it.

42:31.131 --> 42:32.751
I know almost nothing about you.

42:35.347 --> 42:36.781
It's better this way.

42:40.860 --> 42:43.340
No... it's not.

43:04.680 --> 43:07.916
Tell me something I can hold
on to forever and never let go.

43:14.234 --> 43:16.581
Let go.

44:04.390 --> 44:05.391
Hi.

44:07.970 --> 44:09.013
Good morning.

44:13.293 --> 44:17.299
Okay, move your arm,
some of us work for a living.

44:18.926 --> 44:22.886
Um, okay, I get it,
you're holding me hostage.

44:26.852 --> 44:28.325
Will you ever come back?

44:37.010 --> 44:40.497
Are you sure there's no one there
who speaks English, or even Spanish?

44:40.782 --> 44:42.575
No, no, no, we... we want it all.

44:43.197 --> 44:45.333
Il curator compare...

44:45.653 --> 44:47.317
- I have to go.
- Hold on, hold on.

44:47.429 --> 44:48.465
One minute, please.

44:48.515 --> 44:52.114
Give me a second, okay,
I'm trying to deal this in Portuguese.

44:52.244 --> 44:53.245
I can't right now.

44:55.955 --> 44:57.046
What are you trying to say?

44:57.161 --> 45:00.727
The Rain Forest Trust
Fund's to buy 5,000 acres.

45:00.991 --> 45:02.344
Huh, well, you're not even close.

45:02.893 --> 45:04.695
- Here.
- Thank you.

45:05.416 --> 45:08.858
We're confirming the purchase
of 5,000 acres, we good?

45:10.715 --> 45:12.576
The check is in the mail.

45:12.626 --> 45:15.496
Thank you very much, Sir.

45:15.797 --> 45:17.119
I'm late for work.

45:17.147 --> 45:19.781
- Wait. That's it?
- Let go.

45:55.552 --> 45:57.333
<i>It's a $1.50, Ma'am.</i>

46:07.587 --> 46:08.588
<i>Ma'am?</i>

46:08.612 --> 46:10.991
I just changed my mind,
just keep driving please.

46:11.681 --> 46:12.682
You got it.

47:07.604 --> 47:08.605
Reese.

47:09.238 --> 47:10.573
Reese?

47:19.037 --> 47:21.494
Baby, are you okay?

47:23.832 --> 47:25.057
Are you okay, Baby?

47:27.310 --> 47:32.663
<i>His urean creatine levels are way too high,
which means his kidneys are failing.</i>

47:32.713 --> 47:35.553
<i>The toxins are building up
and his body can't handle it.</i>

47:36.351 --> 47:40.864
- Is he in pain?
- It's difficult to say.

47:42.100 --> 47:44.336
If you were me,
what would you do?

47:49.394 --> 47:55.118
I'd be thinking about...
what a wonderful life he's had,

47:57.293 --> 47:59.492
how lucky you are to
have found each other.

48:09.949 --> 48:12.578
May I have a moment
alone with him, please?

48:13.195 --> 48:14.196
Of course.

48:51.739 --> 48:55.378
<i>Hey Jenny! This is Ellis.
I tried you a couple of times.</i>

48:55.891 --> 48:58.789
<i>Hope you got my messages.
Call me back.</i>

50:57.116 --> 50:58.117
Jenny!

51:00.330 --> 51:01.431
What are you doing here?

51:02.832 --> 51:05.475
- Well, I tried to call, but...
- How did you get my address?

51:08.127 --> 51:09.128
The library.

51:11.511 --> 51:14.404
Come on, don't be upset,
I didn't know what else to do.

51:19.186 --> 51:21.131
My dog, I had to...

51:21.972 --> 51:25.379
- I had to put him down.
- Oh, no, I'm so sorry to hear that.

51:25.450 --> 51:27.827
You should have waited
for me to contact you.

51:27.897 --> 51:28.761
Uh, Jenny, there's...

51:28.787 --> 51:30.883
There's a reason I don't
give out my address.

51:31.446 --> 51:35.189
- I'm... I'm sorry, honestly.
- This isn't going to work, I'm moving.

51:35.842 --> 51:37.009
Are you serious?

51:41.169 --> 51:42.913
Hi... for you.

52:02.321 --> 52:05.594
<i>Barbara Ireland before
she moved to Florida,</i>

52:06.522 --> 52:08.465
she got rid of all her books.

52:09.763 --> 52:12.351
I could no sooner get rid
of this book than I could...

52:18.010 --> 52:21.362
Well, it looks like I'm not
the only one getting nostalgic.

52:22.593 --> 52:24.544
You've had such a wonderful life.

52:25.163 --> 52:26.997
I like to think so.

52:28.994 --> 52:33.719
I just wish you... you know, that she
could have been there for more of it.

52:34.504 --> 52:35.585
So do I.

52:39.330 --> 52:40.331
Remember that?

52:40.763 --> 52:43.961
Nineteen fifty-four I
was junior in college.

52:44.609 --> 52:46.413
That's the last photo I have of you.

52:47.060 --> 52:49.109
Well, when you've seen one,
you've seen 'em all.

52:49.814 --> 52:51.015
This is true.

52:58.280 --> 52:59.281
What is it?

53:00.601 --> 53:01.886
What's wrong?

53:02.510 --> 53:04.565
I'm just tired of running,

53:06.586 --> 53:11.362
- of lying to good people.
- Then stop.

53:12.156 --> 53:14.718
Nobody's chasing you anymore.

53:15.396 --> 53:18.418
Anyone who was ever been
suspicious is long dead.

53:19.213 --> 53:21.939
You don't have to be alone forever.

53:22.604 --> 53:25.269
Don't you miss having someone to love?

53:25.882 --> 53:27.905
It's been such a long time.

53:27.980 --> 53:30.210
It's not the same when there's no future.

53:30.328 --> 53:32.491
What are you talkin' about,
you got nothin' but future!

53:32.598 --> 53:36.308
I mean a future together,
growing old together.

53:37.716 --> 53:39.118
Without that, love is, uh...

53:41.124 --> 53:44.574
- it's just heartbreak.
- It's the same for everybody.

53:45.952 --> 53:48.450
How many times has
my heart been broken?

53:48.577 --> 53:49.578
Too many.

53:50.140 --> 53:54.905
If I had your looks and your energy,
I'd fall in love tomorrow, I really would.

53:56.285 --> 53:59.437
- I did meet someone.
- What?

53:59.461 --> 54:02.778
Oh, on New Year's Eve,
he... he jumped on my elevator.

54:02.850 --> 54:03.771
Why didn't you tell me?

54:03.797 --> 54:05.718
Because I knew you'd
look at me like that.

54:07.364 --> 54:12.115
Don't get too excited,
I, uh... I told him to leave me alone.

54:13.029 --> 54:16.048
I was horrible... cruel.

54:16.119 --> 54:19.245
Tell him you're sorry,
tell him you made a mistake.

54:19.767 --> 54:21.244
I can't, I'm leaving.

54:21.922 --> 54:25.202
You're moving to Oregon,
not Timbuktu.

54:27.262 --> 54:31.824
Come on, if you won't do it for yourself,
do it for me.

54:33.031 --> 54:34.032
Please?

54:45.804 --> 54:47.401
- Hello.
- Can I help you?

54:48.192 --> 54:52.090
Uh, I'm here to see Ellis Jones,
he's not expecting me.

54:52.190 --> 54:54.821
Well, let's see what we can do about that.

54:56.164 --> 54:57.165
And you are?

54:58.733 --> 55:00.066
Incredibly sorry.

55:01.555 --> 55:03.796
Mr. Jones, you got a guest down here.

55:04.455 --> 55:07.230
- I bet you got a name.
- Jennifer Larson.

55:08.527 --> 55:12.556
Please, tell him I understand
if he doesn't want to see me.

55:12.627 --> 55:14.547
I'm here just to say I'm sorry,

55:15.090 --> 55:19.049
<i>and that my... my life
has been</i> unbelievable,

55:19.200 --> 55:22.077
since longer than he can imagine,

55:22.186 --> 55:25.796
and I just... I was emotional
the other day, and...

55:27.134 --> 55:30.783
Now that I realize how
incredibly kind to me he's been,

55:30.833 --> 55:33.729
and I... I... I've just been
too stupid to accept it, and...

55:33.846 --> 55:35.854
I know better now, and... and

55:36.624 --> 55:39.756
that's why I want to tell
him how sincerely sorry I am.

55:41.498 --> 55:42.305
Okay.

55:42.331 --> 55:45.556
And ask that... if he could
come downstairs maybe, and...

55:45.925 --> 55:49.275
let me make it up to him
by taking him out tonight?

55:50.875 --> 55:52.343
Please.

55:52.919 --> 55:58.834
Uh, Jennifer Larson, she says
she understands if you don't...

55:58.884 --> 56:01.844
Oh, you heard that? Okay, good.

56:02.393 --> 56:04.232
He wants to know where
you're taking him?

56:05.753 --> 56:08.199
Some place he's never been before.

56:34.764 --> 56:36.655
- Hello.
- Hey, Jenny.

56:36.756 --> 56:37.657
C'mon.

56:45.845 --> 56:48.888
All right, you don't actually think
this is my first chop shop do you?

56:48.928 --> 56:52.942
Oh, be quiet,
there's more here that meets the eye.

56:53.743 --> 56:56.936
This used to be one of the most popular
picture houses in the City.

56:58.938 --> 57:01.100
- Movie theater?
- Yes.

57:02.231 --> 57:05.263
In the 1930s,
a woman named Mary Elizabeth Woods,

57:05.365 --> 57:10.700
read about a chemical magnate who had created
the drive-in theater in Camden, New Jersey.

57:11.100 --> 57:14.644
And, so naturally she made one
of her own here in San Francisco.

57:14.944 --> 57:17.617
Everyone thought she
was crazy as a loon, which she was.

57:17.647 --> 57:20.168
She would sleep with anyone
who wasn't her husband,

57:20.269 --> 57:24.133
and she used to put on these airs like she
was better than anyone else. In fact...

57:26.107 --> 57:27.339
anyway.

57:28.233 --> 57:31.135
Because of local ordinances she
couldn't have an open-air theater,

57:31.723 --> 57:33.382
so she brought all the car in here.

57:33.933 --> 57:36.482
That's the screen, right there!

57:36.587 --> 57:40.404
It was spectacular...
I imagine.

57:43.913 --> 57:46.089
- Are you ready for the best part?
- Sure.

57:46.568 --> 57:47.942
Okay, look up.

57:58.546 --> 58:01.717
She had photo luminescent
filaments installed.

58:04.284 --> 58:07.201
They took the time to
create the constellations.

58:10.017 --> 58:11.239
<i>Isn't it beautiful?</i>

58:16.121 --> 58:17.122
Yeah.

58:27.156 --> 58:28.157
What are you doing?

58:28.811 --> 58:29.812
C'mon.

58:42.677 --> 58:43.863
Cheers.

58:44.653 --> 58:47.724
<i>The great paradox of all this is that...</i>

58:47.832 --> 58:51.336
the better our instruments get,
that farther we can see.

58:52.443 --> 58:55.635
But not into the future, into the past.

58:56.337 --> 58:59.041
The events who's light
hasn't even reached us yet.

58:59.152 --> 59:02.642
I don't think I'll ever understand
why so few people care about history?

59:03.266 --> 59:06.072
The future has its charm, too.

59:07.862 --> 59:09.411
We could talk about our ours.

59:11.825 --> 59:14.885
- Ellis...
- Not the distant future.

59:15.687 --> 59:19.655
- Talk about this weekend.
- What did you have in mind?

59:20.558 --> 59:25.597
My parents are having a party to celebrate
their 40th wedding anniversary.

59:25.647 --> 59:27.324
It's just a couple of hours from here.

59:30.003 --> 59:31.004
Come with me.

59:45.905 --> 59:47.837
Okay.

59:49.519 --> 59:50.920
Can I drive?

59:59.699 --> 01:00:04.434
<i>Oh, my God, you know you rarely
see a</i> Saab in the Daytona 500.

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:06.265
There's a reason for that.

01:00:06.466 --> 01:00:11.069
Then... ya know, you might wanna consider an
occasional tap on that square pedal by your foot.

01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:12.702
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:00:15.024 --> 01:00:21.311
Oh, my God! Oh, sorry!
What's wrong with you?

01:00:28.738 --> 01:00:30.890
Do me a favor, stop and pick her up.

01:00:31.090 --> 01:00:35.813
- Ooh, I'd rather not get stabbed.
- That's my sister.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.770
Sorry.

01:00:46.195 --> 01:00:48.297
- What's up pussycat?
- Need a ride?

01:00:48.768 --> 01:00:49.769
What's it look like?

01:00:53.533 --> 01:00:55.835
- How are you?
- Good, hi!

01:00:56.986 --> 01:01:00.039
Get out! Still driving the Saab, huh?

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.942
- Yeah, it's good to see you, too.
- Hey!

01:01:02.031 --> 01:01:05.904
Kikki, this is Jenny.
Jenny, this is my sister.

01:01:06.005 --> 01:01:07.777
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:01:08.177 --> 01:01:10.059
You should have told me
you were taking the bus.

01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:11.691
We'd of picked you up at the station.

01:01:11.891 --> 01:01:13.843
I stopped using
telephones 2 months ago.

01:01:15.184 --> 01:01:16.916
Any particular reason?

01:01:17.457 --> 01:01:21.781
To protest the involvement of telecomm firms
in the development of hi-tech weapon systems.

01:01:23.623 --> 01:01:25.294
Kikki graduated from Berkeley.

01:01:26.936 --> 01:01:29.698
So this is the new one, huh?

01:01:31.361 --> 01:01:33.604
Have you done him yet?

01:01:34.374 --> 01:01:36.526
Yes, 10 minutes ago,
right where you're sitting.

01:01:40.199 --> 01:01:43.783
<i>So what's the story with</i> this girl,
she... she works there?

01:01:43.983 --> 01:01:45.735
I told everything Ellis told me.

01:01:49.248 --> 01:01:50.249
Thank you.

01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:52.141
Beautiful girl,

01:01:54.364 --> 01:01:56.015
works in a public library.

01:01:56.836 --> 01:01:59.329
Maybe she likes books... and silence.

01:01:59.639 --> 01:02:01.140
Or maybe she Google'd him,

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:04.394
and found out about his generous
contributions and then...

01:02:04.834 --> 01:02:07.736
worked her way in there so
she could get her hooks into him.

01:02:07.837 --> 01:02:09.188
Yeah, I'll bet that's it.

01:02:09.569 --> 01:02:12.392
- Shouldn't they be here by now?
- You clear the table.

01:02:23.503 --> 01:02:24.544
<i>They're here!</i>

01:02:25.024 --> 01:02:26.025
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:26.746 --> 01:02:27.747
How do I look?

01:02:29.919 --> 01:02:30.920
Very pretty.

01:02:36.866 --> 01:02:38.337
Oh! There you are!

01:02:38.438 --> 01:02:39.579
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

01:02:40.259 --> 01:02:44.784
- Aaw, Honey! You look great.
- Look who we picked up on the way.

01:02:44.834 --> 01:02:46.255
Hi, Baby.

01:02:47.547 --> 01:02:49.988
- So, this is Jenny.
- Hello.

01:02:50.089 --> 01:02:52.070
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:02:52.171 --> 01:02:54.032
You must be exhausted after your trip.

01:02:54.133 --> 01:02:57.347
Oh, no, it was nothing.
We made it in like 18 minutes.

01:02:57.547 --> 01:03:01.770
No I'm not amused.
He knows I hate it when he speeds.

01:03:01.871 --> 01:03:05.334
It wasn't me, it was Jenny, I swear,
she thinks she has nine lives.

01:03:05.435 --> 01:03:06.093
Let me take your coat.

01:03:06.155 --> 01:03:07.567
- Oh, okay.
- Where ya been?

01:03:07.767 --> 01:03:10.421
- What, you forget where we live?
- No.

01:03:11.911 --> 01:03:13.753
Uh, this is my dad, William.

01:03:13.953 --> 01:03:16.966
- Dad, this is...
- Adaline.

01:03:23.973 --> 01:03:26.055
Jenny, actually.

01:03:29.909 --> 01:03:31.741
Dad, you okay?

01:03:34.464 --> 01:03:36.128
I'm sorry, it's just...

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:40.527
you look exactly like this
old friend of mine that I...

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.051
Adaline Bowman.

01:03:44.874 --> 01:03:45.875
That's my mother.

01:03:48.348 --> 01:03:49.808
You joking? Really?

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:51.481
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh!

01:03:51.781 --> 01:03:58.868
- Did you know her?
- Yeah! Yeah!

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:04.442
We were very close, I...
I knew her in London.

01:04:04.967 --> 01:04:07.996
Yeah, yes she lived there in the 60s.

01:04:08.097 --> 01:04:09.628
Right before she, ah...

01:04:09.729 --> 01:04:12.472
moved to Paris and met my father.

01:04:12.772 --> 01:04:14.793
Incredible, what are the odds?

01:04:14.894 --> 01:04:16.796
Wow, wow.

01:04:16.996 --> 01:04:21.381
The resemblance is absolutely amazing.
You must hear it all the time.

01:04:22.111 --> 01:04:23.853
For as long as I can remember.

01:04:24.053 --> 01:04:25.925
Wow! We were very close.

01:04:26.125 --> 01:04:30.082
You've just said that already.
I don't believe you never mentioned her.

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:31.950
Oh, yeah, I must've...

01:04:32.031 --> 01:04:35.612
No, no... no, I remember
your close, close friends.

01:04:35.662 --> 01:04:37.481
How she doin'?

01:04:39.539 --> 01:04:43.373
She passed away... 6 years ago.

01:04:43.943 --> 01:04:44.944
No, really?

01:04:46.806 --> 01:04:49.339
Oh, wow, I'm so sorry.

01:04:55.004 --> 01:04:56.696
An extraordinary woman.

01:04:56.946 --> 01:04:59.729
Yeah, well, it runs in the family.

01:05:05.865 --> 01:05:07.556
- Come on, want something to eat?
- Yeah.

01:05:07.657 --> 01:05:09.579
Yeah, I made cheesecake.

01:05:11.721 --> 01:05:13.643
We're kinda tired actually.

01:05:14.404 --> 01:05:16.366
I think we'll head up,
if that's okay with you?

01:05:16.756 --> 01:05:18.017
- Me too.
- Really?

01:05:18.217 --> 01:05:19.899
All right, I have you
in the back bedrooms.

01:05:19.969 --> 01:05:21.461
<i>Ha! You're in the back.</i>

01:05:22.992 --> 01:05:23.993
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:05:24.033 --> 01:05:25.875
It's so nice to meet you.

01:05:26.626 --> 01:05:31.234
- Dad...
- Oh, hey.. hey, Baby.

01:06:31.401 --> 01:06:32.402
Miss.

01:06:33.843 --> 01:06:34.844
Miss.

01:06:36.616 --> 01:06:38.286
You know, you keep doing that,
you gonna flood your engine.

01:06:38.388 --> 01:06:40.570
Thank you, thank you for the useful tip.

01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:43.113
Well, you gonna get
one hell of a tan at least.

01:06:46.716 --> 01:06:50.610
<i>I'm sorry, I've done</i> everything
I could to get this thing started.

01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:52.422
It won't work.

01:06:54.103 --> 01:06:55.970
All right, all it needs is a push-start.

01:06:56.486 --> 01:06:58.858
Just loose the brake,
I'll give you a push,

01:06:59.268 --> 01:07:01.120
Pop your clutch and you'll take off.

01:07:02.922 --> 01:07:03.923
Okay.

01:07:06.125 --> 01:07:07.126
Thank you.

01:07:09.539 --> 01:07:10.939
- Ready?
- Ready, you ready?

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:11.941
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:07:14.484 --> 01:07:15.645
Okay! Now pop your clutch.

01:07:18.778 --> 01:07:19.819
Thank you!

01:07:23.232 --> 01:07:24.233
You're welcome.

01:07:42.472 --> 01:07:44.744
<i>They would spend the next
five weeks together.</i>

01:07:45.234 --> 01:07:49.278
<i>And Adaline did something that she
promised herself she would never do.</i>

01:07:49.479 --> 01:07:52.552
You know, you...
you still haven't told me your name.

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:55.915
Adaline Bowman.

01:07:57.276 --> 01:07:59.959
- But my friends tell me Della.
- That's beautiful.

01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:02.171
Thank you.

01:08:03.222 --> 01:08:08.297
<i>Three weeks later, his semester completed,
William flew home to the United States.</i>

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.863
Adaline, came with him.

01:08:56.916 --> 01:08:57.917
Hey.

01:08:59.408 --> 01:09:00.634
How'd you sleep?

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:02.822
- Fine.
- Good.

01:09:10.259 --> 01:09:14.198
Sorry about last night, I didn't
mean to embarrass you, it's just...

01:09:16.576 --> 01:09:18.386
I must be losin' it.

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:20.238
It's okay.

01:09:25.825 --> 01:09:27.256
- Hey!
- When did you come up?

01:09:28.216 --> 01:09:31.451
- Not too late, I read for a while.
- Hmm...

01:09:33.032 --> 01:09:34.033
- Hi, Baby.
- Mwah!

01:09:35.444 --> 01:09:37.807
- Where's Jenny?
- She'll be down in a sec.

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:40.038
<i>She was up all night,
tossing and turning.</i>

01:09:41.130 --> 01:09:43.483
You know, you've never
told us how you guys met.

01:09:44.243 --> 01:09:47.166
We met in an elevator on New Year's Eve.

01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:50.649
- You want some coffee?
- No, thank you.

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:53.542
<i>But, I'd seen her once before that.</i>

01:09:54.059 --> 01:09:55.060
Hey.

01:09:55.084 --> 01:09:58.728
<i>It was at the library, she was reading
a book on Braille and I just</i>

01:09:58.828 --> 01:10:00.289
I knew she was an original.

01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:02.552
Here you go, Baby.
So was her mom.

01:10:03.633 --> 01:10:05.144
How did you meet her mother?

01:10:06.406 --> 01:10:11.491
<i>It was outside London.</i>
Her car broke down, I helped her fix it.

01:10:11.891 --> 01:10:16.025
So, she was English? Oh, no, no she
was just there studying French.

01:10:16.576 --> 01:10:19.469
- Spoke like what, four languages?
- I think so.

01:10:19.479 --> 01:10:20.480
- Wow.
- Yeah.

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:23.232
- Jenny's brilliant with languages, too.
- Really?

01:10:23.883 --> 01:10:26.545
So, how old were you when you met her?

01:10:26.646 --> 01:10:28.398
Oh, I was about, uh...

01:10:28.498 --> 01:10:31.376
Let's see, that was the second year
of med school, so I was like...

01:10:31.541 --> 01:10:33.115
Twenty-six.

01:10:34.834 --> 01:10:38.358
I was thinkin' about
quitting medicine... bored.

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:40.269
<i>But I was...</i>

01:10:41.661 --> 01:10:44.293
I was afraid I was too old to start over.

01:10:45.945 --> 01:10:46.946
I told...

01:10:48.508 --> 01:10:51.531
I told Adaline about it
and she laughed in my face.

01:10:51.921 --> 01:10:57.767
<i>"She said, " Go for it, don't
be silly, life's too short.</i>

01:10:57.907 --> 01:11:02.567
<i>Wasn't for her I'd probably
wouldn't've found astronomy, physics.</i>

01:11:02.862 --> 01:11:06.214
<i>She was only couple of years
older than I was but she was so wise.</i>

01:11:06.316 --> 01:11:07.817
She was so...

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.298
I don't know... sophisticated.

01:11:17.957 --> 01:11:18.958
She, uh...

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:35.475
- What? Honey?
- That's enough, William.

01:11:36.386 --> 01:11:38.848
What? What's... what's cooking?

01:11:38.988 --> 01:11:40.700
What, you think this is funny?

01:11:41.331 --> 01:11:43.423
What do you mean? I'm do...
What did I do?

01:11:43.523 --> 01:11:48.237
You were very close, you were very close,
you said that to me twice now.

01:11:49.058 --> 01:11:51.790
And you should see your face
when you talk about her.

01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:54.684
Are you going to wax nostalgic
this whole god damn weekend?

01:11:54.694 --> 01:11:56.876
Look, it's just that...

01:11:56.956 --> 01:11:59.035
she looks so much like her mother that...

01:11:59.085 --> 01:12:02.381
that I'm remembering things that
I didn't even know I remembered.

01:12:02.482 --> 01:12:04.913
Well, I'd hate feeling like second choice.

01:12:05.014 --> 01:12:06.716
- What do you mean?
- Especially this weekend.

01:12:06.746 --> 01:12:08.236
- Second choice?
- Yes.

01:12:08.338 --> 01:12:10.700
Forty years, Baby, come on...

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.812
Second choice? Uh-uh.

01:12:13.533 --> 01:12:16.125
Honey, you're blowing this
all out of proportion.

01:12:16.235 --> 01:12:17.236
Am I?

01:12:17.837 --> 01:12:19.198
Are you jealous?

01:12:21.831 --> 01:12:24.339
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

01:12:24.694 --> 01:12:28.418
Look, look, it was fleeting,

01:12:29.419 --> 01:12:31.319
inconsequential.

01:12:33.493 --> 01:12:35.842
Sounded like you were more than that.

01:12:38.257 --> 01:12:39.369
I love you.

01:12:40.259 --> 01:12:42.802
- I love you, too.
- Come on.

01:13:02.261 --> 01:13:03.262
I'm coming!

01:13:05.545 --> 01:13:07.987
<i>It's not the most romantic weekend.</i>

01:13:08.287 --> 01:13:09.959
Thanks for being such a good sport.

01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:12.842
- Of course!
- I promise I'll make it up to ya.

01:13:26.706 --> 01:13:29.228
Sorry about my dad,
it's really embarrassing.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:31.761
He's lovely.

01:13:34.414 --> 01:13:36.906
Yeah, your mom must've
really been something.

01:13:39.018 --> 01:13:40.299
Yeah, she was.

01:13:47.667 --> 01:13:48.668
Kikki!

01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:55.124
So, guys, Dad is running
a 47 game winning streak.

01:13:55.825 --> 01:13:59.819
All the money I spent on your education,
I was hoping for stronger competition.

01:13:59.919 --> 01:14:02.041
- Have you played this before?
- No never.

01:14:02.051 --> 01:14:04.394
- Kikki, come on!
- Do I have to?

01:14:04.504 --> 01:14:05.895
- Yeah!
- Yes!

01:14:06.666 --> 01:14:10.339
The idea is to get enough
of these little wedges.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.161
- Pie.
- They're cheese.

01:14:12.642 --> 01:14:17.357
They're wedges, you get enough of 'em to
fill-up your circle then you win, okay?

01:14:17.458 --> 01:14:19.979
<i>Most of the questions are
about this stupid stuff.</i>

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.850
Hence the word "Trivial".

01:14:21.951 --> 01:14:23.713
Yeah, like here's an
example for you, umm...

01:14:24.123 --> 01:14:29.768
"On June 22, 1938, this American boxer
retained his heavyweight championship"

01:14:29.869 --> 01:14:32.682
"when he beat Max Schmeling
in the first round."

01:14:33.252 --> 01:14:36.456
- Well, that is a tough one.
- I know, what do you think?

01:14:40.169 --> 01:14:41.170
Sony Liston?

01:14:41.681 --> 01:14:43.793
- Joe Louis.
- Good guess though, really.

01:14:44.564 --> 01:14:47.726
Women and boxing, it's cute.

01:14:47.827 --> 01:14:49.198
Excuse me, do you know what then?

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.442
You know what, finally
ladies we're on the team.

01:14:52.452 --> 01:14:54.617
- Here, roll the die.
- Here we go. - All right.

01:14:54.667 --> 01:14:55.655
Here we go.

01:14:56.255 --> 01:14:57.256
Women are pink.

01:14:58.227 --> 01:14:59.228
Women are pink?

01:15:03.343 --> 01:15:07.025
"Who was the first United States
President to be born in a hospital."

01:15:07.126 --> 01:15:08.027
Jimmy Carter.

01:15:12.522 --> 01:15:13.523
Jimmy Carter.

01:15:15.391 --> 01:15:16.392
<i>That's fast.</i>

01:15:16.416 --> 01:15:19.198
- Beginners luck.
- I don't think so, try again.

01:15:22.802 --> 01:15:25.875
"At what event did the
'Hula Hoop' make its debut?"

01:15:27.487 --> 01:15:32.822
In 1956, at the World's Fair
in Schenectady, New York.

01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:39.067
1956 World's Fair,
Schenectady, New York.

01:15:39.168 --> 01:15:40.860
Oh, my God.

01:15:42.201 --> 01:15:43.563
- Nice one!
- Wow.

01:15:44.754 --> 01:15:46.971
- Cheese.
- Pie.

01:15:47.612 --> 01:15:49.167
Wedge.

01:15:51.351 --> 01:15:54.212
All right, come on, do this.

01:15:54.314 --> 01:15:55.298
Oh, a lotta pressure.

01:15:55.395 --> 01:15:58.433
Smell somethin',
like your winning streak going up in smoke?

01:15:59.359 --> 01:16:02.003
We've got this family joke,
what would happen first,

01:16:02.086 --> 01:16:06.946
<i>Dad loses in Trivial Pursuit,</i>
or Della finally appears?

01:16:08.938 --> 01:16:09.939
Della?

01:16:10.109 --> 01:16:13.353
<i>Yeah, you remember the comet I told
you about,</i> the one that my dad discovered?

01:16:13.553 --> 01:16:16.436
He named it Della C 1981,

01:16:17.276 --> 01:16:19.923
after my great Aunt Adele.

01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:21.591
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah?

01:16:21.791 --> 01:16:24.457
- Dad, come on.
- Here we go.

01:16:24.507 --> 01:16:25.435
Jenny.

01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:28.297
For the win...

01:16:30.039 --> 01:16:35.705
"Of what country was Albert Einstein
offered the presidency in 1952?"

01:16:41.601 --> 01:16:42.602
Israel.

01:16:45.435 --> 01:16:46.436
Israel.

01:16:52.882 --> 01:16:55.283
It's okay, I still love you.

01:16:55.385 --> 01:16:58.698
How does it feel dad?
<i>Are you sad?</i>

01:16:59.479 --> 01:17:00.480
I'm all right.

01:17:02.862 --> 01:17:07.651
Let's look at page 2, okay?
That's section 3, paragraph H.

01:17:08.528 --> 01:17:11.009
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, I'm going for a walk.

01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:12.412
Okay.

01:17:19.268 --> 01:17:21.290
Yes, let's look at 10... 10.

01:17:41.751 --> 01:17:44.253
How many stars do you think
there are in our galaxy?

01:17:47.467 --> 01:17:49.359
I don't know, five hundred million.

01:17:51.321 --> 01:17:53.632
Coupla hundred billion.

01:17:59.399 --> 01:18:05.995
Plato believed that every soul has a companion
star it that returns to after death...

01:18:06.597 --> 01:18:08.529
if you lived a moral life.

01:18:09.428 --> 01:18:10.429
You believe that?

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:13.696
No, no, I'm a...

01:18:14.089 --> 01:18:19.372
I'm a scientist,
Plato was a philosopher... poet.

01:18:25.872 --> 01:18:27.852
Why did you name your
Comet after my mother?

01:18:32.863 --> 01:18:36.773
If my calculations were correct,
that turned out to be wrong,

01:18:36.974 --> 01:18:43.094
it would've been the closest approach
to Earth of any comet in 200 years.

01:18:44.774 --> 01:18:51.443
In other words,
like your mother, a near miss.

01:18:53.637 --> 01:18:55.128
What does that mean?

01:19:00.031 --> 01:19:02.090
I was gonna propose her.

01:19:06.123 --> 01:19:10.959
I had... I had an engagement
ring in my pocket.

01:19:13.976 --> 01:19:15.474
She stood me up.

01:19:20.998 --> 01:19:22.114
Near miss.

01:19:23.502 --> 01:19:24.503
Good night.

01:19:31.971 --> 01:19:32.974
William.

01:19:37.368 --> 01:19:38.799
She loved you, too.

01:20:00.836 --> 01:20:01.837
Wow.

01:20:02.893 --> 01:20:07.531
We just met, right? I know that.

01:20:09.122 --> 01:20:11.713
Yeah, I should probably shut up right now.

01:20:16.305 --> 01:20:17.445
I'll just shut up.

01:20:18.335 --> 01:20:19.897
Come on, what?

01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:26.141
What is it?

01:20:26.242 --> 01:20:29.865
I... I... I... I just gotta
tell you the truth, I...

01:20:30.653 --> 01:20:32.824
I can't imagine my life without you.

01:20:34.032 --> 01:20:37.242
I know it's probably the last
thing wanna hear right now, but,

01:20:39.778 --> 01:20:41.822
I'm falling in love with you, Jenny.

01:20:42.751 --> 01:20:43.928
I can't help it.

01:20:49.284 --> 01:20:51.073
I don't know what to say.

01:20:55.275 --> 01:20:56.757
I deal with all of this with respect.

01:20:57.047 --> 01:21:00.914
Please, do not say anything, all right?
I just wanted you to know how I feel.

01:21:18.619 --> 01:21:21.611
- Oh, hello.
- Jenny.

01:21:22.805 --> 01:21:24.303
Do you know where everyone went?

01:21:24.804 --> 01:21:29.273
Yeah, Kathy and Kikki went to the
market and Ellis went for a... for a run.

01:21:29.375 --> 01:21:33.123
- Well, okay.
- You have a bug in your hair.

01:21:33.173 --> 01:21:34.326
- It's all right, it's a...
- What it is?

01:21:34.427 --> 01:21:35.967
It's a ladybug.

01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:38.866
They say they're good luck.

01:21:40.899 --> 01:21:41.900
Did you get it?

01:21:43.415 --> 01:21:45.666
- Got it.
- Thank you.

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:52.705
Please tell Ellis that I went for a walk.

01:22:40.887 --> 01:22:42.969
- Della, you okay?
- Oh, my God!

01:22:59.145 --> 01:23:01.283
- This is gonna sting.
- Okay, okay.

01:23:12.509 --> 01:23:14.053
Don't worry, we'll fix you up.

01:23:19.476 --> 01:23:22.266
Oh! Oh!

01:23:47.556 --> 01:23:48.812
Excuse me... hi.

01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:52.949
- Do you mind taking our photo?
- Sure.

01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:54.945
Okay, I don't, I don't.

01:23:54.995 --> 01:23:56.717
- It's going to be great.
- I don't want it.

01:23:56.795 --> 01:24:00.091
- Wadya mean you don't want it?
- No, we're wasting film.

01:24:01.148 --> 01:24:02.384
I'm just really shy.

01:24:02.485 --> 01:24:05.151
Three, two, one...

01:24:55.828 --> 01:24:56.829
I know.

01:24:59.399 --> 01:25:01.595
I know who you are, Adaline.

01:25:04.671 --> 01:25:05.672
What?

01:25:08.097 --> 01:25:13.601
The scar... the same scar,
I stitched it myself.

01:25:15.245 --> 01:25:16.246
Please.

01:25:19.318 --> 01:25:20.846
The truth.

01:25:30.238 --> 01:25:32.040
William.

01:25:38.981 --> 01:25:41.133
I thought I was losing my mind.

01:25:44.109 --> 01:25:47.833
How? How is this possible?

01:25:52.961 --> 01:25:54.401
I don't... I don't know.

01:25:56.928 --> 01:25:59.273
I...I, I was normal.

01:26:02.122 --> 01:26:04.751
And then one day...
I just stopped.

01:26:07.106 --> 01:26:11.887
I wanted to tell you so badly,
but I couldn't.

01:26:13.259 --> 01:26:14.988
You know what they'd do to me, I...

01:26:15.896 --> 01:26:18.313
- I would have been a...
- Curiosity.

01:26:20.859 --> 01:26:22.062
- A specimen.
- Yes.

01:26:27.476 --> 01:26:33.749
That's why you left?
That's why you... disappeared?

01:26:40.583 --> 01:26:42.404
You can't imagine how much it hurt.

01:26:45.221 --> 01:26:48.710
I think, I... I think I can.

01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:58.100
- You've never told anyone?
- No.

01:26:59.237 --> 01:27:02.222
If I had, it would have been Ellis.

01:27:07.804 --> 01:27:10.115
<i>Don't, don't run away.</i>

01:27:11.268 --> 01:27:14.583
Don't disappear again, please... for Ellis.

01:27:15.274 --> 01:27:17.525
- Adaline...
- Please.

01:27:20.173 --> 01:27:24.377
All these years,
you've lived but you've never had a life.

01:27:25.876 --> 01:27:31.017
Please, for yourself,
for Ellis, stay, Adaline.

01:27:32.262 --> 01:27:33.353
I don't know how.

01:27:33.970 --> 01:27:36.465
Don't run away, Adaline. Adaline!

01:27:37.188 --> 01:27:38.189
Adaline!

01:28:55.638 --> 01:28:58.413
Adaline don't, don't.
Adaline, please.

01:28:59.535 --> 01:29:00.686
Please don't do this.

01:29:00.827 --> 01:29:04.432
Adaline, don't.
Think about Ellis, please!

01:29:05.178 --> 01:29:07.399
Adaline, please! Adaline!

01:29:33.238 --> 01:29:36.839
<b><u>Ellis, I'm so sorry. I can't do this.
I can't explain. Jenny.

01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:47.758
Dad! Dad!

01:29:48.925 --> 01:29:50.130
Dad, where're your keys?

01:29:55.043 --> 01:29:55.954
She's gone.

01:30:02.035 --> 01:30:04.811
She's not coming back, Son.

01:30:05.031 --> 01:30:08.510
What just happened?
What, what... what is this?

01:30:09.628 --> 01:30:12.546
- Dad, what the hell did you say to her?
- Nothing.

01:30:15.212 --> 01:30:16.637
She can't explain.

01:30:17.389 --> 01:30:19.617
Please tell me what she said.

01:30:22.422 --> 01:30:25.827
- She's not capable.
- Of what?

01:30:31.133 --> 01:30:33.076
Of change.

01:30:59.884 --> 01:31:00.940
Do you love her?

01:31:02.352 --> 01:31:03.653
Son?

01:31:04.495 --> 01:31:06.726
Listen to me. Do you love her?

01:31:07.604 --> 01:31:08.605
Yes.

01:31:11.795 --> 01:31:12.796
How do you know?

01:31:13.456 --> 01:31:16.478
- Dad, I don't...
- It's a simple question.

01:31:17.708 --> 01:31:18.709
How do you know?

01:31:21.722 --> 01:31:23.625
Because nothing makes
sense without her.

01:32:29.442 --> 01:32:31.202
- <i> Hello.</i>
- Oh.

01:32:31.465 --> 01:32:33.387
Darling, I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean to wake you.

01:32:33.408 --> 01:32:36.442
- <i> Everything okay?</i>
- No, no... I just wanted to tell you...

01:32:36.492 --> 01:32:37.430
<i>What is it?</i>

01:32:38.808 --> 01:32:40.681
You're right, no more running.

01:32:40.792 --> 01:32:44.176
- <i>Mom?</i>
- I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

01:32:44.329 --> 01:32:46.850
- <i>I am so happy to hear that.</i>
- I love you.

01:32:46.997 --> 01:32:48.704
- <i>I love you too.</i>
- Bye.

01:32:48.811 --> 01:32:49.812
<i>Bye, Mama.</i>

01:34:03.514 --> 01:34:08.030
<i>The moon is responsible for much of what
takes place on the surface of the Earth.</i>

01:34:08.758 --> 01:34:12.939
<i>A stray meteor hit
the Moon in 1178.</i>

01:34:13.735 --> 01:34:16.125
<i>The resulting concussion
would cause extreme tides</i>

01:34:16.195 --> 01:34:19.637
<i>on every lunar phase
in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina.</i>

01:34:20.358 --> 01:34:23.880
<i>A 23% rise in the mean
tide on this night</i>

01:34:24.384 --> 01:34:28.534
<i>produced a storm 2000 miles
off the Pacific coast,</i>

01:34:29.612 --> 01:34:33.824
<i>causing an increase in amount of
molecular ionization in the atmosphere.</i>

01:34:35.307 --> 01:34:37.797
<i>And for the first time in 78 years,</i>

01:34:38.993 --> 01:34:42.607
<i>snow fell in this
part of Sonoma County.</i>

01:34:46.736 --> 01:34:49.247
<i>In the first stages of hypothermia,</i>

01:34:49.364 --> 01:34:53.209
<i>the body will try to generate
heat through shivering.</i>

01:34:54.617 --> 01:34:59.110
<i>When this fails, it would decrease
the flow of blood to the extremities.</i>

01:35:00.495 --> 01:35:03.403
<i>Metabolism slows to a crawl.</i>

01:35:04.919 --> 01:35:07.619
<i>You're dying, but you don't know it.</i>

01:35:09.681 --> 01:35:10.977
<i>In the final stages...</i>

01:35:11.628 --> 01:35:14.583
<i>the victim only breathes
once or twice a minute.</i>

01:35:15.993 --> 01:35:19.825
<i>A state of suspended animation.</i>

01:35:45.593 --> 01:35:46.594
Jenny!

01:35:47.497 --> 01:35:54.307
<i>At 10:07 p.m., Adaline Bowman's core
temperature had dropped to 87 degrees.</i>

01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:58.417
<i>Her heart stopped beating.</i>

01:36:20.891 --> 01:36:24.868
<i>At last, at the age of
one hundred and seven,</i>

01:36:25.705 --> 01:36:30.235
<i>Adaline Bowman was, by
any definition, dead.</i>

01:36:39.663 --> 01:36:43.301
<i>At precisely 10:09
p.m., paramedics placed</i>

01:36:43.351 --> 01:36:46.649
<i>two defibrillator paddles
on Adaline Bowman's chest.</i>

01:36:48.391 --> 01:36:54.366
<i>They counted the prescribed 5 seconds before
administering 750 volts of electricity.</i>

01:38:10.670 --> 01:38:11.671
How is she?

01:38:11.695 --> 01:38:15.781
We've just run a series of tests
and don't see any long term damage.

01:38:16.289 --> 01:38:17.931
It's quite remarkable, in fact.

01:38:18.507 --> 01:38:20.171
Is she awake? Can I go see her?

01:38:20.321 --> 01:38:23.591
She's exhausted but you might
be able to get in a few words.

01:38:23.606 --> 01:38:25.828
Okay, thank you.

01:38:43.019 --> 01:38:44.020
Hi.

01:38:48.689 --> 01:38:49.933
Jenny.

01:38:51.415 --> 01:38:53.718
- Hi.
- Hey!

01:39:09.068 --> 01:39:10.498
I know why you ran away.

01:39:13.361 --> 01:39:14.362
You do?

01:39:15.541 --> 01:39:18.133
It's because of what I said
to you last night, isn't it?

01:39:19.089 --> 01:39:21.117
I told you I loved you.

01:39:22.359 --> 01:39:23.838
- And you got scared, I shouldn't...
- Come here, I love you.

01:39:23.888 --> 01:39:26.165
Come here, come here, I love you.

01:39:35.357 --> 01:39:37.147
I love you, too.

01:39:57.209 --> 01:39:59.047
There's something else.

01:40:06.542 --> 01:40:09.271
What? What is it?

01:40:17.752 --> 01:40:22.587
Well, first, my name isn't Jenny.

01:40:34.834 --> 01:40:36.648
My God, what happened?

01:40:36.810 --> 01:40:39.317
Nothing, nothing, an accident,
I'm fine. Okay?

01:40:39.367 --> 01:40:40.393
- But...
- Hey...

01:40:40.747 --> 01:40:42.827
I'm better than fine. Okay?

01:40:44.904 --> 01:40:47.224
- This is Ellis.
- Hello.

01:40:47.333 --> 01:40:48.104
- <i> Hello.</i>

01:40:48.130 --> 01:40:51.215
- He's the man, I've
been telling you about.

01:40:55.086 --> 01:40:56.307
Nice to meet you.

01:40:58.361 --> 01:41:00.847
I'm Jenny's grandmother.

01:41:09.935 --> 01:41:12.000
What? What is it?

01:41:14.157 --> 01:41:15.049
He knows.

01:41:20.735 --> 01:41:21.736
He knows.

01:41:43.493 --> 01:41:46.401
Hey, everybody, I don't wanna ruin
the party, but I wanna say something.

01:41:46.497 --> 01:41:48.645
First of all, thanks for being here.

01:41:48.695 --> 01:41:51.990
Kathy and I are really grateful
that you could all be here.

01:41:52.091 --> 01:41:55.880
It means a lot to us that you
would be here and to help

01:41:55.965 --> 01:42:01.110
us celebrate the first...
first 40 years of our marriage.

01:42:02.522 --> 01:42:05.375
When I first met this lovely lady,

01:42:07.106 --> 01:42:08.528
back in the olden days,

01:42:09.148 --> 01:42:15.514
I had a... I had a pretty good idea
what I wanted to do in my job,

01:42:15.615 --> 01:42:19.549
but I didn't really...

01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:21.951
know what I wanted to...

01:42:22.632 --> 01:42:27.827
be as a man when I grew up,
if I ever grew up.

01:42:29.989 --> 01:42:33.573
But the commitment that she made...

01:42:34.273 --> 01:42:38.107
to our marriage and to our family, to me...

01:42:38.868 --> 01:42:42.732
the... quality of her love...

01:42:44.534 --> 01:42:49.715
led me to understand that I could
have no greater ambition...

01:42:49.765 --> 01:42:57.006
in life, than to be the best
possible husband I could be for her.

01:42:57.507 --> 01:42:59.991
And I'm still working on it.

01:43:02.101 --> 01:43:06.918
So here's to Kathy, love of my life,

01:43:08.408 --> 01:43:12.832
mate of my soul, mother
of my lovely children.

01:43:14.634 --> 01:43:15.655
To Kathy.

01:43:25.435 --> 01:43:27.996
 One year later.

01:43:30.009 --> 01:43:32.601
<i>We are back, live in Times Square.</i>

01:43:32.702 --> 01:43:35.794
<i>And now, only a few minutes from
the moment we've all been waiting for,</i>

01:43:35.895 --> 01:43:41.684
- <i>... drop ball... to 2016.</i>
- There ya are, Honey, good girl. Yeah.

01:43:45.505 --> 01:43:49.548
Hey, you guys, you better hurry
up, you're gonna be late for the event.

01:43:49.649 --> 01:43:52.821
- Yeah, I've been ready for 10 minutes.
- Oh, so handsome.

01:43:52.922 --> 01:43:55.024
- Thank you.
- I'm ready, too.

01:43:55.875 --> 01:43:58.097
- Wow.
- I just need this zipped.

01:43:58.768 --> 01:44:00.450
Are you sure you don't wanna come with us?

01:44:00.499 --> 01:44:01.741
I'm positive.

01:44:02.992 --> 01:44:06.165
I've got my date, right here.
Come here, Baby.

01:44:08.438 --> 01:44:10.278
- I love you.
- Love you.

01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:13.612
I have to grab my clutch.
<i>Oh, and my camera.</i>

01:44:13.713 --> 01:44:16.836
- He's getting so big.
- Yeah.

01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:52.870
Adaline, you okay?

01:44:56.686 --> 01:44:57.687
Yes.

01:45:01.851 --> 01:45:02.852
Perfect.

01:45:05.815 --> 01:45:09.969
<i>The instant Adaline's heart was
struck by the defibrillator paddles,</i>

01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:14.554
<i>the telomere structures in her
genes regained their pliability,</i>

01:45:15.284 --> 01:45:18.618
<i>Causing her to resume
the natural course of aging.</i>

01:45:19.919 --> 01:45:21.811
<i>William was right after all,</i>

01:45:22.492 --> 01:45:25.785
<i>the comet, Della C 1981,
finally did return.</i>

01:45:26.666 --> 01:45:33.433
<i>A half century late. But as bright
and magnificent as he had predicted.</i>
