00:30.247 --> 00:31.857
I'm Avery Ford...

00:31.901 --> 00:33.903
and I "aim to please."

00:33.946 --> 00:34.947
Lose the smile.

00:37.733 --> 00:38.908
Now you're scowling.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.214
Tip up the hat

00:40.257 --> 00:43.043
so we can see your eyes.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.044
They're bloodshot?

00:44.087 --> 00:45.393
- I didn't sleep.
- Great.

00:45.436 --> 00:46.742
Lower the hat.

00:51.225 --> 00:52.530
I'm Avery Ford,

00:52.574 --> 00:53.768
and if you love the west
like I do,

00:53.792 --> 00:56.099
you don't wanna
see another sundown

00:56.143 --> 00:57.535
without Chuck Wagon Beans.

00:57.579 --> 01:00.886
I'm Avery Ford...
and I "aim to please."

01:00.930 --> 01:02.236
Cut! I guess that's a wrap.

01:02.279 --> 01:05.282
Beautiful, Mr. Ford!
That's a wrap.

01:06.414 --> 01:07.806
You think I could
get an autograph?

01:07.850 --> 01:10.157
Sure. Who do I
make this out to?

01:10.200 --> 01:11.419
"Susan."

01:11.462 --> 01:13.943
Susan. Is that your mom?
Your sister?

01:13.986 --> 01:15.138
Actually, it's my grandmother.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.641
She's a huge fan.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.121
Great.

01:20.297 --> 01:21.603
- Thank you!
- Yeah.

01:21.646 --> 01:22.821
That was good.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.259
What am I doing up there?

01:25.302 --> 01:27.783
Y-You got me selling beans.

01:27.826 --> 01:28.784
Well, you'll be eating them

01:28.827 --> 01:30.394
without this endorsement.

01:30.438 --> 01:31.700
You need the money.

01:31.743 --> 01:33.571
Well, maybe you should
cut your commissions.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.617
Well, 10% of nothing
is still nothing.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.098
I'm just not sure
I can do it anymore.

01:38.141 --> 01:39.273
You can and you will,

01:39.316 --> 01:41.013
because you signed a contract.

01:42.624 --> 01:44.147
Look, I said "hazelnut coffee,"

01:44.191 --> 01:45.192
not candy.

01:45.235 --> 01:47.281
Get... yeah. Look.

01:47.324 --> 01:48.282
Quick, please.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.458
Look, you always doubt yourself

01:50.501 --> 01:52.068
between movies.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.287
I'm not the only one.

01:53.330 --> 01:54.873
Well, the studio's
just playing hardball.

01:54.897 --> 01:55.854
They'll come around.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.160
Really? Why?

01:57.204 --> 01:58.161
'Cause the world needs
Aim to Please 6?

01:58.205 --> 01:59.728
Fast and Furioushas seven.

01:59.771 --> 02:02.034
Well, horses aren't
that fast, or furious.

02:02.078 --> 02:04.776
Look... It's hazelnut.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.648
Everything is fine.

02:06.691 --> 02:07.953
You're Avery Ford.

02:07.997 --> 02:10.130
Yeah.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.218
Still.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.393
Dinner tonight?

02:12.436 --> 02:14.003
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.285
Why? You're not still seeing,
what's-her-name?

02:15.309 --> 02:16.614
No.

02:16.658 --> 02:18.007
Well, then?
Come on.

02:18.050 --> 02:20.052
You know I'm still half in love
with you.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.315
No, you're not,

02:21.358 --> 02:23.143
and it's the other half
I'm worried about.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.804
- Evening, Mr. Ford.
- Fred.

02:32.848 --> 02:35.155
This came for you.

02:37.461 --> 02:39.507
Thank you.

02:50.866 --> 02:52.389
No, no. You...
You go ahead.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.348
I'll, I'll catch the next one.

03:03.574 --> 03:04.986
Going into the final round

03:05.010 --> 03:06.577
before eliminations,

03:06.621 --> 03:08.797
and let's see what our
chefs have got for us.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.016
Terry's poached his salmon
with a lemon vinaigrette

03:11.060 --> 03:13.323
that he's just now
starting to drizzle.

03:13.367 --> 03:14.672
High marks for aesthetics again,

03:14.716 --> 03:16.152
but if smug looks count,

03:16.196 --> 03:19.416
that will keep him
well in last place...

03:42.047 --> 03:43.266
Dad.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.921
Come on,
haven't you seen that one?

03:45.964 --> 03:47.966
Well, you know me.
I like old stuff.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.272
Well, then you won't mind

03:49.316 --> 03:51.274
last night's coffee.

03:53.407 --> 03:54.712
Hmph.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.714
Could be worse.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.368
Could it?

03:58.412 --> 04:00.065
Maybe not.

04:00.109 --> 04:02.851
I can't believe
it's almost winter.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.461
Yeah, we open in two weeks.

04:04.505 --> 04:06.246
I better get
to mending those fences.

04:06.289 --> 04:08.639
There's time.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.902
I thought we had a group
booked opening weekend.

04:10.946 --> 04:13.340
They canceled.

04:13.383 --> 04:15.907
Was a time we were
booked solid year-round.

04:15.951 --> 04:18.692
And we will be again.

04:18.736 --> 04:21.478
Heather, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

04:21.522 --> 04:22.740
but every ride's got to end.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.002
Since when do you give up?

04:24.046 --> 04:25.526
I'm a realist, if nothing else.

04:25.569 --> 04:26.764
Maybe this is our eight seconds.

04:26.788 --> 04:27.919
It's not.

04:27.963 --> 04:28.983
We just need
a little jump-start.

04:29.007 --> 04:30.071
You know, something
to put the ranch

04:30.095 --> 04:31.358
back in people's minds.

04:31.401 --> 04:33.751
I was thinking...
A promotional event.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.755
You know, bring in a guest
to kick off the season,

04:35.797 --> 04:36.972
generate some publicity.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.626
Like who?

04:38.669 --> 04:40.734
If people don't want to come,
we can't lure 'em in like fish.

04:40.758 --> 04:41.866
How about we bring in a cowboy?

04:41.890 --> 04:43.170
Honey, all my old cowboy friends

04:43.195 --> 04:44.893
are either
too busted up to travel

04:44.936 --> 04:46.460
or six feet under.

04:46.503 --> 04:49.985
Anybody else out there
got somethin' to say?

04:50.028 --> 04:52.335
Well, I got somethin' to say.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.598
I can't guarantee
you're gonna like it.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.387
Then again...

05:00.430 --> 05:02.345
I aim to please.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.391
How about him?

05:22.409 --> 05:24.367
It's 10:00 a.m.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.545
It's 10:00 a.m.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.331
Siri, what's the weather today?

05:31.374 --> 05:33.202
The weather in New York

05:33.245 --> 05:34.856
is sunny with a high of 52.

05:34.899 --> 05:37.685
There is a 10% chance of showers.

05:41.558 --> 05:42.777
Hello!

05:42.820 --> 05:44.387
Am I late for something?

05:44.431 --> 05:46.346
No, but an intriguing offer
just came in.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.435
Doesn't have anything to do
with beans, does it?

05:48.478 --> 05:49.827
What are you doing next weekend?

05:49.871 --> 05:51.699
Red Sox/Yankees, home plate.

05:51.742 --> 05:52.656
Record it.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.179
You're going to Montana.

05:54.223 --> 05:55.485
Where is that?

05:55.529 --> 05:56.897
Wait. That's west
of the Hudson River, right?

05:56.921 --> 05:58.140
You heard of Casey Twain?

05:58.183 --> 06:00.882
I've heard of MarkTwain.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.013
Let's see.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.232
Casey Twain,

06:03.275 --> 06:05.190
World Champion
Saddle Bronc Rider,

06:05.234 --> 06:06.409
eight gold buckles.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.803
Well, he owns a dude ranch
near Big Sky,

06:08.846 --> 06:10.848
it sounds like
a five-star resort.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.459
Every famous cowboy

06:12.502 --> 06:14.330
has stayed there
at one point or another,

06:14.374 --> 06:16.506
and they are hosting
a PR event for you.

06:16.550 --> 06:19.379
- Why?
- They're fans.

06:19.422 --> 06:20.467
No, I mean really.

06:20.510 --> 06:21.531
You're so cynical.

06:21.555 --> 06:22.686
Hey, I'm from New York.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.253
Cowboy calls me up
out of the blue...

06:24.296 --> 06:25.535
Well, actually,
his daughter called,

06:25.559 --> 06:27.212
and she sounds perfectly normal.

06:27.256 --> 06:29.650
Yeah, well, so did
Kathy Bates in Misery.

06:29.693 --> 06:30.868
No.

06:30.912 --> 06:34.002
It's one weekend.

06:34.045 --> 06:36.091
All you gotta do is show up,

06:36.134 --> 06:38.354
sign a few autographs,
meet a few fans,

06:38.398 --> 06:39.747
eat a steak.

06:39.790 --> 06:40.878
I'm a vegetarian!

06:40.922 --> 06:42.358
Thought you were over that?

06:42.402 --> 06:44.926
No, I'm actually thinking
about going microbiotic...

06:44.969 --> 06:47.711
The studio is really
excited about this,

06:47.755 --> 06:49.365
and they're putting out
a press release.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.584
I didn't say yes yet.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.107
I said yes for you.

06:52.150 --> 06:53.543
But I'm not going,

06:53.587 --> 06:55.086
because I have to
host something else here...

06:55.110 --> 06:56.894
It's a new client.

06:56.938 --> 06:58.200
Really? Who?

06:58.243 --> 06:59.201
Tyler Mahoney.

06:59.244 --> 07:00.855
What? He's, like, 15?

07:00.898 --> 07:02.857
He's 20, and we are
launching his new brand,

07:02.900 --> 07:05.250
but I'm available to you
24/7 on the phone.

07:05.294 --> 07:07.427
Great. Yeah.

07:07.470 --> 07:10.081
I'll send you a text
from under the stampede.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.104
And his steak tartare...

07:13.128 --> 07:16.044
I know you hate jeans,
but buy a pair.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.915
Okay?

07:17.959 --> 07:19.351
Get a spray-tan.

07:19.395 --> 07:22.093
It looks like you haven't
been outside in a year.

07:32.887 --> 07:35.455
Hey. Mr. Ford.
How are you?

07:37.282 --> 07:39.110
Did you have a good flight?

07:59.653 --> 08:01.959
We're just down here.

08:08.183 --> 08:10.141
Wow, this is it?

08:10.185 --> 08:12.100
I just figured
there'd be a little more...

08:15.799 --> 08:17.584
The door's, it's a bit sticky.

08:17.627 --> 08:18.628
Sorry.

08:27.811 --> 08:30.988
So, I'll see you tomorrow
at the shindig?

08:31.032 --> 08:32.294
Shindig.

08:32.337 --> 08:34.991
Yeah, I'll be there.

08:35.035 --> 08:36.037
Great.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.626
Mr. Ford?

08:59.669 --> 09:00.757
I'm Heather Twain.

09:00.801 --> 09:03.455
It's Avery.

09:03.499 --> 09:05.501
And thanks for being
a fan of my movies.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.678
I can't tell you how many times
I've seen them.

09:08.722 --> 09:09.766
Got a favorite?

09:11.202 --> 09:13.161
That would be hard to say.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.858
Yeah.

09:14.902 --> 09:17.034
There really...

09:17.078 --> 09:19.602
isn't very much
around here, is there?

09:19.646 --> 09:21.865
The way I see it,
there's everything.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.273
That's Curly.

09:24.302 --> 09:26.130
Hey, Curly, boy!

09:26.174 --> 09:27.305
She's a girl.

09:27.349 --> 09:28.587
Yeah, that...
That was my next guess.

09:28.611 --> 09:29.873
Ooh!

09:29.917 --> 09:31.658
She could stand to lose a few?

09:31.701 --> 09:33.007
No, no, she's pregnant.

09:33.050 --> 09:35.662
Right. Well, congratulations.
Who's the father?

09:35.705 --> 09:38.055
You wouldn't know him.
Curly! Go.

09:39.056 --> 09:41.189
I see you've lassoed a suitcase.

09:41.232 --> 09:43.495
Leave it here.
We'll come and get it later.

09:43.539 --> 09:44.975
Um, my stuff's in there.

09:45.019 --> 09:46.890
Yeah, it'll still be there
when you get back.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.155
Guess I have been
in the city too long.

09:51.199 --> 09:52.548
A cowboy in New York.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.029
You must miss
the wide open spaces.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.508
Got Central Park.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.249
It's 834 acres.

09:58.293 --> 09:59.860
You walked it off?

09:59.903 --> 10:01.035
Google.

10:01.078 --> 10:04.038
You have been
in the city too long.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.517
Are you limping?

10:05.561 --> 10:08.869
Nah. Just... Just
an old riding injury.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.716
Wouldn't have anything
to do with those new boots,

10:10.740 --> 10:12.742
and, this, would it?

10:12.786 --> 10:15.571
Yeah. You got me.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.834
It was the airline,
they lost my boot bag.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.072
You don't wear your boots?

10:19.096 --> 10:22.056
No, my feet swell up
when I fly, and...

10:22.099 --> 10:24.841
Well, we got saddle soap
in the barn.

10:24.885 --> 10:26.277
To soften up the boots.

10:26.321 --> 10:27.452
Right.

10:27.496 --> 10:31.326
So, you... you live here,
a-all year round?

10:31.369 --> 10:33.328
Yeah. It's home.

10:34.459 --> 10:35.635
Come on.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.724
The property was
homesteaded in the 1880s.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.248
My great-great-grandfather
turned it into a working ranch,

10:40.291 --> 10:41.989
and, eventually, a dude ranch.

10:42.032 --> 10:44.556
Wow.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.082
This... it's
rustic, you know?

10:48.125 --> 10:50.127
Thanks.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.608
Where's all the people, though?

10:52.652 --> 10:53.609
I sort of figured

10:53.653 --> 10:54.915
there'd be a lot more going on.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.632
We don't open up
for another two weeks.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.267
A lot of people coming in
for you tomorrow, though.

10:59.310 --> 11:01.095
You've got a lot of fans
around here.

11:01.138 --> 11:02.749
Well, "I aim to please."

11:02.792 --> 11:04.228
What?

11:04.272 --> 11:05.752
My movies?

11:05.795 --> 11:08.058
Right. You know,

11:08.102 --> 11:11.105
my dad is really
looking forward to meeting you.

11:11.148 --> 11:12.106
Yeah. Likewise.

11:12.149 --> 11:14.282
I mean, I can't...
I can't tell you

11:14.325 --> 11:16.414
how long I've been
studying his career.

11:16.458 --> 11:19.200
He was something in his heyday.
You ever see him ride?

11:19.243 --> 11:22.464
No. Not... I mean,
personally, in person.

11:22.507 --> 11:25.728
He's slowed down some,
but he's still got it in him.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.599
Come on,
I'll introduce you to him.

11:27.643 --> 11:28.949
He's out with the horses.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.298
Horses?

11:30.341 --> 11:32.256
I don't want to...

11:32.300 --> 11:34.476
Bother him.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.391
You can help him
break in the new pony.

11:36.434 --> 11:37.740
I can't.

11:37.784 --> 11:38.978
There's... There's phone calls.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.395
I have to return them, check in.

11:40.438 --> 11:42.136
Of course.

11:42.179 --> 11:44.747
I'll show you to your cabin.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.533
That's the original cabin.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.146
There's rooms in the Main House,

11:52.189 --> 11:54.409
but I figured
you'd want your privacy.

11:54.452 --> 11:55.410
I should warn you,

11:55.453 --> 11:56.604
cell reception's
a little spotty.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.500
Best spot is the hay loft
in the barn.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.241
But you... you do have Wifi?

12:00.284 --> 12:02.156
Yeah, we haven't gotten
around to that yet.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.201
What?

12:14.037 --> 12:15.386
This is you.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.824
This... is me?

12:20.087 --> 12:23.220
Wow. Bunk beds?

12:24.482 --> 12:26.615
Haven't slept in one of those
for a while.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.138
The top bunk has a great view.

12:28.182 --> 12:30.314
Kind of like the penthouse?

12:30.358 --> 12:33.840
So just give a holler
if you need anything.

12:33.883 --> 12:34.841
Hey...

12:34.884 --> 12:37.017
You got any bottled water?

12:44.938 --> 12:46.374
Straight from the lake.

12:47.897 --> 12:49.551
So I'll see you at dinner.

12:49.594 --> 12:50.595
5:30 okay?

12:51.858 --> 12:53.076
You eat at 5:30?

12:53.120 --> 12:54.164
5:00 better?

12:54.208 --> 12:56.036
No, I'll hold out till 5:30.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.516
Great.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.074
It smells good.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.250
Where is he?

13:43.910 --> 13:45.912
That's him?

13:45.955 --> 13:47.435
Airport boots,

13:47.478 --> 13:49.350
and his suitcase is on wheels.

13:49.393 --> 13:50.481
Boy.

13:52.309 --> 13:54.529
A real pleasure, Mr. Ford.
I'm a big admirer.

13:54.572 --> 13:57.053
I feel the same way,
and it's, Avery.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.272
Call me Casey.

13:58.315 --> 13:59.839
And you can
put your purse down, son.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.798
This is a messenger bag.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.932
I, I just don't like to
leave my tablet unattended.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.213
Well, we have that
in common, then.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.196
I don't like to leave
my hat unattended.

14:10.501 --> 14:11.459
How 'bout a drink?

14:11.502 --> 14:13.678
Okay.

14:16.246 --> 14:18.466
To long sunsets
and happy trails.

14:26.169 --> 14:28.868
Doesn't get
any better than that.

14:33.394 --> 14:34.786
How do you like your steak?

14:34.830 --> 14:36.223
Any way it comes.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.267
Well...

14:37.311 --> 14:38.747
Blood-red's what I like.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.184
Wow. That's big.

14:41.228 --> 14:42.316
Wait till you taste it.

14:42.359 --> 14:43.447
I gotta say,

14:43.491 --> 14:44.709
your movies

14:44.753 --> 14:46.755
kept me company through
a lot of long nights.

14:46.798 --> 14:49.497
Yeah, well, it's,
legends like you

14:49.540 --> 14:51.238
that gave me something
to emulate.

14:51.281 --> 14:53.414
Well, I wouldn't say
I'm a legend.

14:53.457 --> 14:55.416
I've heard you say it
a few times, Dad.

14:55.459 --> 14:58.636
So, Avery, we don't
know much about you,

14:58.680 --> 14:59.918
other than
what we've seen on the screen.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.597
Yeah, I like to keep
my private life private.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.946
No wife or kids?

15:03.990 --> 15:05.992
No. Haven't been
down that trail.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.951
- Heather's single, too.
- Dad.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.320
Just laying the cards
on the table.

15:10.344 --> 15:11.693
Let's keep the cards
in the deck.

15:11.736 --> 15:13.695
Well, they gotta be dealt
sometime. Right, Avery?

15:17.220 --> 15:19.179
- Not a pig person?
- Not per se.

15:19.222 --> 15:20.876
All right.
Come on, Curly. Come on.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.356
Lemonade?

15:22.399 --> 15:24.575
Great.

15:43.768 --> 15:46.597
Good stuff!

15:47.772 --> 15:50.210
You know, my agent didn't
really give me a schedule.

15:50.253 --> 15:51.863
Maybe you could shoot me a text.

15:51.907 --> 15:53.561
Or I could
just tell you right now,

15:53.604 --> 15:55.693
since we're right here
sitting next to each other.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.869
Why didn't I think of that?

15:57.913 --> 15:59.393
Breakfast at 7:00.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.221
Then you'll mingle
with the guests,

16:01.264 --> 16:03.745
give a little talk,
and sign some autographs.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.157
Don't forget
the open pit barbecue.

16:05.181 --> 16:06.356
You like ribs, right?

16:06.400 --> 16:08.837
Yeah. More meat? Perfect.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.380
You sawed through
that steak pretty quick.

16:10.404 --> 16:11.579
Want another?

16:11.622 --> 16:12.623
No! No.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.408
I'm a one-steak kinda guy.

16:15.452 --> 16:18.890
But it was great, and I'm...

16:20.196 --> 16:22.720
Just the trip... it's kinda
got me all worn out.

16:24.244 --> 16:25.593
Ooh, I think...

16:25.636 --> 16:28.248
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna... I'm gonna turn in.

16:28.291 --> 16:32.295
I wanna thank you guys
for a very memorable dinner.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.690
Of course.

16:35.733 --> 16:36.996
Thanks.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.783
I'll see ya.

17:31.485 --> 17:32.529
Hello?

17:32.573 --> 17:34.096
Yeah... Y-You hear me?

17:34.140 --> 17:35.315
I-I can't...

17:35.358 --> 17:36.925
Can you hear me now?

17:36.968 --> 17:38.796
- Hello?
- Hello?

17:38.840 --> 17:39.971
Candace! Listen.

17:40.015 --> 17:41.538
You have got
to call this thing off!

17:41.582 --> 17:42.539
Not a chance.

17:42.583 --> 17:43.845
There's press coming,

17:43.888 --> 17:45.608
and the last thing that you need
is bad P.R.

17:47.762 --> 17:48.937
What is that noise?

17:48.980 --> 17:50.808
You have gotta
get me outta here now!

17:50.852 --> 17:53.768
I am trapped. In a barn!
With animals! And hay!

17:53.811 --> 17:54.943
Made of wood!

17:54.986 --> 17:55.987
And yes...

17:56.031 --> 17:57.598
I...

17:57.641 --> 17:58.686
Hello?

17:58.729 --> 18:00.383
Avery?

18:16.530 --> 18:19.837
No, no, no, no.

18:19.881 --> 18:22.884
No...!

18:24.538 --> 18:26.670
Man!

18:32.633 --> 18:35.157
That the steak
you loved so much?

18:35.201 --> 18:38.334
Okay, you caught me.
I don't eat meat.

18:38.378 --> 18:39.703
I gotta get this
in some rice, stat.

18:39.727 --> 18:40.728
Rice?

18:40.771 --> 18:43.165
Y... Ooh!
Maybe hay will work.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.429
Could you be any less
of a cowboy?

18:48.823 --> 18:51.521
I am an actor.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.480
Yeah. We fake things.

18:53.523 --> 18:54.698
Like your entire image?

18:54.742 --> 18:55.830
It sells movies.

18:55.873 --> 18:57.223
The ones you pretended to watch.

18:57.266 --> 18:58.528
I was being polite.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.356
"Polite"?

19:00.400 --> 19:01.662
Were you being polite

19:01.705 --> 19:03.509
when you said this place
was a five-star resort?

19:03.533 --> 19:04.708
No Wifi?

19:04.752 --> 19:06.710
This... We don't need
the virtual world.

19:06.754 --> 19:07.885
We have the real one.

19:07.929 --> 19:09.887
You know,
Paradise Ranch is legendary!

19:09.931 --> 19:11.889
- So is Pompeii!
- There are a lot of...

19:11.933 --> 19:13.693
people showing up here
tomorrow to see you.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.391
Not a problem. Yeah, I can
keep the charade going

19:15.415 --> 19:16.459
another 24 hours.

19:16.503 --> 19:17.547
Can you?

19:17.591 --> 19:19.419
I've been doing it half my life.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.046
You awake?

19:38.089 --> 19:39.961
I am now.

19:41.049 --> 19:42.920
Room service?

19:42.964 --> 19:44.400
You missed breakfast.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.886
You have a cricket in your room.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.409
It's a sleep aid.

19:54.628 --> 19:55.866
You know
we have real crickets here?

19:55.890 --> 19:57.108
Good, save me some battery.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.762
The press arrives in 20 minutes.

19:58.806 --> 20:00.436
Is that enough time for you
to iron your jeans?

20:00.460 --> 20:02.113
I got permanent-press.

20:03.463 --> 20:04.855
Hey! Could put a log on...

20:20.871 --> 20:21.959
He's cute.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.134
You have a boyfriend.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.179
You don't.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.267
And trust me, when I do,

20:25.311 --> 20:26.268
it won't be him.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.096
Hey.

20:32.622 --> 20:33.971
Hey,

20:34.015 --> 20:36.496
thought you said half the town
was gonna be here.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.280
This is half the town.

20:38.324 --> 20:39.455
Hi!

20:39.499 --> 20:42.197
Hi! I'm Jen,
Heather's best friend.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.851
And, um, unlike her,

20:43.894 --> 20:47.681
I've seen everything
that you've ever been in.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.813
Thank you.
I'm, I'm honored.

20:56.472 --> 20:58.909
And here he is now...

20:58.953 --> 21:01.782
Fresh out of the saddle...

21:01.825 --> 21:03.784
Paradise Ranch
is thrilled to welcome

21:03.827 --> 21:04.959
Mr. Avery Ford.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.224
Thank you.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.139
I'm, I am thrilled to be here.

21:11.182 --> 21:13.794
You know, we have a saying
in New York...

21:13.837 --> 21:16.144
Trust your neighbors,
but brand your cattle.

21:17.667 --> 21:18.929
Mr. Ford?

21:18.973 --> 21:20.080
Will Matthews with
the Montana Gazette.

21:20.104 --> 21:21.323
I'm a big fan.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.107
- Thanks, Will.
- I think all of us...

21:23.151 --> 21:25.980
want to know when is the next
Aim to Pleasecoming out?

21:26.023 --> 21:29.331
Well, they tell me
it is just around the bend.

21:29.375 --> 21:32.334
It's been three years,
now, right, Mr. Ford?

21:32.378 --> 21:33.640
Yeah. Aren't... Aren't you

21:33.683 --> 21:35.816
the kid that picked me up
at the airport?

21:35.859 --> 21:37.663
Yeah. I'm also a reporter
for the Elkhorn Press.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.646
What is that?

21:39.689 --> 21:41.561
My high school paper.

21:41.604 --> 21:43.693
Great. Well, you can

21:43.737 --> 21:45.434
tell your readers that, um,

21:45.478 --> 21:47.044
I'm still "aiming to please,"

21:47.088 --> 21:50.526
and like all good rides,
it'll be worth the wait.

21:50.570 --> 21:51.962
And, as promised,

21:52.006 --> 21:55.357
Mr. Ford will be reading
one of his legendary scenes.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.278
This is embarrassing.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.411
Without my reading glasses,

22:05.454 --> 22:07.369
my arms are not long enough.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.544
Try mine!

22:10.416 --> 22:11.591
Sure...

22:11.634 --> 22:13.593
Okay.

22:13.636 --> 22:17.466
Um, well...
You know what they say.

22:17.510 --> 22:20.382
Whatever happens
at the dude ranch...

22:20.426 --> 22:22.689
stays at the dude ranch.

22:26.432 --> 22:30.392
"There's no place in life
to really find yourself

22:30.436 --> 22:32.394
"like being on
the back of a horse.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.396
"Everything just looks better
up there.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.000
"The grass is greener,
the skies are..."

22:40.271 --> 22:41.969
Do you want me to run him off?

22:42.970 --> 22:44.928
No, I'll do it.

22:50.325 --> 22:52.066
You're trespassing.

22:52.109 --> 22:53.763
I thought the whole town
was invited.

22:53.807 --> 22:55.243
Everyone except you.

22:55.286 --> 22:57.086
Is that a way
to treat an old friend, Heather?

22:57.114 --> 22:59.508
- We go way back.
- Not far enough.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.138
And we're sure as hell
not going forward.

23:01.162 --> 23:03.730
I'll come back
when things quiet down.

23:03.773 --> 23:04.774
Don't bother.

23:06.341 --> 23:09.300
You know, we're gonna have to
talk about this, Heather.

23:09.344 --> 23:11.172
It's not going to go away.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.352
Wow, you guys
are actually eating fruit.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.614
I promise not to tell.

23:18.658 --> 23:19.963
Pardon me,
Mr. Ford, sir?

23:20.007 --> 23:21.574
Can I get a few more
shots of you?

23:21.617 --> 23:23.140
The light is perfect right now.

23:23.184 --> 23:24.620
Sure. Where...
Where do you want me?

23:24.664 --> 23:25.621
On a horse would be great.

23:25.665 --> 23:29.320
How... how about over here?

23:29.364 --> 23:30.539
You know, by the barbecue?

23:30.583 --> 23:32.383
"No better place to forget
about your troubles

23:32.411 --> 23:34.325
than on the back
of a horse."

23:34.369 --> 23:35.544
Right, Mr. Ford?

23:35.588 --> 23:38.112
Yeah, but I mean, guys, come on.

23:38.155 --> 23:39.809
I mean,
how many times have we seen it?

23:39.853 --> 23:41.332
Horse, cowboy,

23:41.376 --> 23:43.049
I mean, that image...
How many times can we do it?

23:43.073 --> 23:44.335
Not enough for my liking.

23:44.379 --> 23:45.336
I'll go get the horse.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.338
Mine either.
It's a classic!

23:47.382 --> 23:48.688
- It's classic.
- Classic.

23:48.731 --> 23:49.776
Classic!

23:50.820 --> 23:51.952
"Classic."

24:00.047 --> 24:02.005
Excuse me.
Dead man walkin'.

24:02.049 --> 24:04.007
Coming through.

24:08.403 --> 24:09.839
This... is a horse.

24:09.883 --> 24:11.493
Yeah. I've seen
one before.

24:11.537 --> 24:12.799
Central Park?

24:12.842 --> 24:13.842
Mr. Ed.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.765
Get on.

24:22.809 --> 24:24.811
Okay.

24:28.075 --> 24:29.816
What are you doing?

24:29.859 --> 24:32.471
This, is what I do.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.189
Yeah, I just come over,
I get like this,

24:36.213 --> 24:37.867
the director
sends a stuntman in,

24:37.911 --> 24:39.782
but this is as far as I go.

24:42.393 --> 24:45.135
Just step up

24:45.179 --> 24:46.354
and swing your leg over.

24:46.397 --> 24:47.921
Just do it. She's sweet.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.792
Step and swing your leg over.

24:49.836 --> 24:50.793
Come on. One, two...

24:50.837 --> 24:51.838
Three!

24:51.881 --> 24:52.839
Get on there!

24:52.882 --> 24:53.883
Okay, there.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.935
No, no, no.
Don't go away.

25:13.903 --> 25:16.253
Whoa!

25:24.435 --> 25:27.526
I'm a trained professional.
It's all right.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.571
You know, in pictures,
we have professional horses.

25:29.615 --> 25:33.053
Very smart. They don't do
anything stupid, like...

25:35.708 --> 25:37.579
Stupid...

25:49.635 --> 25:52.159
Thank you for interrupting
your poker game.

25:52.202 --> 25:53.639
You did me a favor.

25:53.682 --> 25:55.728
I was losing.

25:56.772 --> 25:59.166
Follow my finger.

26:00.384 --> 26:01.777
How'd this happen?

26:01.821 --> 26:03.605
- I...
- He fell off Buttercup.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.086
"Buttercup"?

26:06.129 --> 26:08.175
Would you feel better
if she had a different name?

26:08.218 --> 26:09.742
I couldn't feel any worse.

26:09.785 --> 26:11.395
She can be a bit persnickety.

26:11.439 --> 26:14.007
Yeah, runs in the family,
from what I can tell.

26:14.050 --> 26:15.288
Well, you have
a mild concussion.

26:15.312 --> 26:16.705
Doesn't appear serious.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.770
Great. Then I can get on
the next flight outta here.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.535
Sorry, no flying.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.276
The altitude pressure
could cause swelling.

26:22.319 --> 26:24.495
- How long?
- To be safe... about a week.

26:24.539 --> 26:25.758
A week?

26:25.801 --> 26:27.518
A week seems like
a really long time, Dr. Frank.

26:27.542 --> 26:28.935
Yes, it does.

26:28.978 --> 26:30.284
Better safe than sorry.

26:30.327 --> 26:31.783
I'm not sure I agree
with that philosophy.

26:31.807 --> 26:32.982
I know I don't.

26:33.026 --> 26:34.438
I'll be out to the ranch
in a few days

26:34.462 --> 26:36.309
to give Henry his shots,
I'll check in on you then.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.509
- Who's Henry?
- You haven't met Henry?

26:38.553 --> 26:41.034
He's uncomfortable
around horses.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.737
What kind of doctor are you?

26:48.781 --> 26:50.304
Large animal vet.

26:52.001 --> 26:53.655
Anybody seen my stethoscope?

26:57.006 --> 26:58.051
You took me to a vet?

26:58.094 --> 27:00.662
The "people" doctor
was on vacation.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.577
Quite a ride, Mr. Ford!

27:02.621 --> 27:05.449
Great, so, there's only, what,

27:05.493 --> 27:06.799
one doctor in this town?

27:06.842 --> 27:08.757
There were two.
The other one passed.

27:08.801 --> 27:09.932
Don't worry!

27:09.976 --> 27:12.152
You're in good hands
with Dr. Frank.

27:12.195 --> 27:13.675
Well...

27:13.719 --> 27:17.505
frozen peas, horse doctor...

27:17.548 --> 27:19.159
Here's your opportunity.

27:19.202 --> 27:20.682
Could use a drink.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.118
Put the peas back on your head.

27:22.162 --> 27:24.164
They're melted.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.522
Hey. There's
Avery Ford.

27:42.399 --> 27:43.923
Hey, you two!

27:43.966 --> 27:45.141
So...

27:45.185 --> 27:47.622
Is this... Is this like a date?

27:47.666 --> 27:49.015
- No.
- Absolutely not.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.193
What's going on?

27:53.236 --> 27:54.716
- You didn't see it?
- See what?

27:57.893 --> 28:00.461
Where'd you get that?

28:00.504 --> 28:03.377
They're all over the Internet.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.596
My...

28:07.903 --> 28:10.123
And it just keeps
getting better.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.342
You were supposed to
bring us publicity.

28:12.386 --> 28:13.996
Well, apparently, I have.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.215
There goes the season.

28:15.258 --> 28:17.478
The season?
What about my career?

28:17.521 --> 28:19.088
What's left of it.

28:19.132 --> 28:21.830
Drink, please.

28:23.571 --> 28:24.833
Instagram,

28:24.877 --> 28:26.226
Twitter, Snapchat...

28:26.269 --> 28:27.986
CNN! It has gone viral.
Are you seeing this?

28:28.010 --> 28:31.187
No, no,
because I'm still living it.

28:31.231 --> 28:33.035
Well, I just got off the phone
with the studio,

28:33.059 --> 28:34.689
and they are distancing
themselves from you.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.497
What does
"distancing themselves" mean?

28:36.540 --> 28:37.541
It's polite speak,

28:37.585 --> 28:38.736
but they are killing the movie.

28:38.760 --> 28:39.998
And they want
your holding fee back.

28:40.022 --> 28:41.589
Can they do that?

28:41.632 --> 28:44.070
Can you just get out of there
before this gets any worse?

28:44.113 --> 28:45.071
I can't travel.

28:45.114 --> 28:46.768
What?

28:46.812 --> 28:48.398
Apparently, the altitude
can cause swelling.

28:48.422 --> 28:50.163
What is that noise?

28:50.206 --> 28:52.600
They call it music.

29:00.651 --> 29:01.740
On the house.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.742
Thanks.

30:12.332 --> 30:14.987
You're lucky I'm sworn
to uphold the law, Clem,

30:15.030 --> 30:17.206
or I'd have killed you already.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.531
No. No, no...

30:37.574 --> 30:38.662
No...

30:43.406 --> 30:44.364
Sorry, wrong door.

30:44.407 --> 30:45.844
Sorry.

30:50.892 --> 30:52.241
Did I mention I was sorry?

30:52.285 --> 30:53.242
Twice.

30:53.286 --> 30:54.374
Yeah.

31:19.834 --> 31:21.749
Buttercup looks good.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.058
We look like idiots.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.470
Honey, if I worried about
what people think,

31:27.494 --> 31:29.037
I wouldn't have climbed
on that first brock.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.976
There's no way that
he is staying here a week.

31:31.019 --> 31:32.238
We've had worse guests.

31:32.281 --> 31:33.281
They were paying guests.

31:38.287 --> 31:40.202
Hello?

31:40.246 --> 31:44.772
Dr. Frank, thank you
for getting back to me.

31:55.391 --> 31:56.740
How's the head, son?

31:56.784 --> 31:57.741
It's better.

31:57.785 --> 31:59.352
Any memory problems?

31:59.395 --> 32:00.919
Unfortunately, no.

32:00.962 --> 32:03.573
I remember every detail.

32:03.617 --> 32:04.748
Hey...

32:04.792 --> 32:06.272
If you haven't
fallen from a horse,

32:06.315 --> 32:08.404
you haven't ridden long enough.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.929
Yeah, in my case,
I'm not sure that applies.

32:10.972 --> 32:12.191
It always applies.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.845
I don't know why I came here.

32:14.889 --> 32:16.412
I'm sorry, Casey.

32:16.456 --> 32:17.737
You think I didn't know
you were a city slicker

32:17.761 --> 32:19.241
from the first film I saw?

32:19.285 --> 32:20.939
You might have
those New Yorkers fooled,

32:20.982 --> 32:22.679
but you can't snow
an old cowboy.

32:22.723 --> 32:24.072
Why didn't you say anything?

32:24.116 --> 32:25.702
Well, I figured you could
at least ride a horse.

32:25.726 --> 32:27.423
I've got stunt guys for that.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.208
See, I act like I'm mounting up,

32:29.251 --> 32:31.732
and then I act like I dismount.

32:32.820 --> 32:33.908
Here, come here.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.737
What?

32:36.780 --> 32:37.738
Sign it.

32:37.781 --> 32:38.739
Why?

32:38.782 --> 32:40.306
I still like your movies.

32:40.349 --> 32:41.785
At least I used to.

32:41.829 --> 32:43.198
The last few have
gone off the rails a bit.

32:43.222 --> 32:45.615
Yeah, more like a train wreck.

32:45.659 --> 32:47.269
When's the next one out?

32:47.313 --> 32:48.967
It might be a while.

32:49.010 --> 32:50.490
I can wait.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.980
This is cool.

33:02.023 --> 33:02.981
Thanks.

33:03.024 --> 33:03.982
What is it?

33:04.025 --> 33:05.635
Just kidding.

33:05.679 --> 33:09.335
Everybody knows even a horse
needs a blanket, right?

33:09.378 --> 33:10.336
I've been making them

33:10.379 --> 33:11.902
ever since I started riding.

33:11.946 --> 33:14.296
I'm pretty sure they're
more for me than the horses.

33:14.340 --> 33:15.994
Anyway,

33:16.037 --> 33:17.299
Dr. Frank says

33:17.343 --> 33:19.432
that there's no problem
with you driving.

33:19.475 --> 33:22.000
Dr. Frank the,
large animal vet?

33:22.043 --> 33:23.740
There's a rental car
place in Billings.

33:23.784 --> 33:26.004
You leave now, you could be
home in three days.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.441
I'll just wait it out here.

33:28.484 --> 33:30.269
I'm not much of a road trip guy.

33:30.312 --> 33:32.140
I thought you couldn't
wait to leave.

33:32.184 --> 33:33.533
I don't drive, okay?

33:33.576 --> 33:34.925
What?

33:34.969 --> 33:35.709
What, you're going to
make me say it again?

33:35.752 --> 33:37.015
How do you get around?

33:37.058 --> 33:39.452
I take cabs, subway.

33:39.495 --> 33:42.672
You know, sometimes, I walk,
when I'm not wearing boots.

33:42.716 --> 33:44.152
I guess you are stuck here.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.327
Yeah.

33:48.548 --> 33:51.333
You might like this one.

33:51.377 --> 33:54.293
Wow.

33:54.336 --> 33:57.165
He's so young here.

33:57.209 --> 33:59.167
Is this the championship ride,

33:59.211 --> 34:00.516
Amarillo, '71?

34:00.560 --> 34:01.778
How did you know that?

34:01.822 --> 34:02.823
Are you kidding me?

34:02.866 --> 34:04.868
That is like rodeo history.

34:04.912 --> 34:07.436
Casey Twain, Wendell...

34:07.480 --> 34:08.437
I Googled it.

34:08.481 --> 34:10.178
You know, you're
very lucky here,

34:10.222 --> 34:11.527
with the books, the movies,

34:11.571 --> 34:13.051
you've got all the classics.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.181
Yeah, I think I've seen

34:14.226 --> 34:16.358
everything in this room
at least once.

34:16.402 --> 34:17.706
Everything but mine.

34:17.751 --> 34:18.969
Can I ask you something?

34:19.013 --> 34:20.188
I don't see why not.

34:20.232 --> 34:21.731
There's not much
left to hide at this point.

34:21.755 --> 34:23.713
Why'd you start doing
western movies?

34:23.757 --> 34:26.020
I squint a lot.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.501
You know, looks good
when I'm wearing a hat,

34:28.543 --> 34:29.806
'cause I have a big forehead,

34:29.850 --> 34:30.806
it cuts it down...

34:30.851 --> 34:31.808
You know.

34:31.851 --> 34:33.723
I always wanted to be an actor.

34:33.766 --> 34:36.465
It seemed like a great way
to escape from real life.

34:36.509 --> 34:37.466
In a highrise?

34:37.510 --> 34:38.728
Group home.

34:38.772 --> 34:41.643
That's what they call
an orphanage these days.

34:41.688 --> 34:42.645
I'm sorry.

34:42.688 --> 34:45.213
Nah, it was a long time ago.

34:45.257 --> 34:46.735
I can't imagine
not having a family.

34:46.780 --> 34:48.739
I can't imagine what
it would be like to have one.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.043
Still, it's a lot to overcome.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.915
I started working
at a deli in Queens

34:51.958 --> 34:53.786
when I was 19 years old.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.571
I am having trouble
picturing that.

34:55.614 --> 34:56.572
Are you kidding me?

34:56.616 --> 34:57.660
The paper hat,

34:57.704 --> 34:58.748
rocking a hair-net.

34:58.792 --> 35:00.620
Anyway, one of
the customers comes in,

35:00.663 --> 35:02.883
and he's a producer,

35:02.926 --> 35:04.580
says he likes my look,

35:04.624 --> 35:06.024
gives me a bit part
in this Western.

35:06.060 --> 35:07.061
The rest is history.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.411
Okay...

35:09.455 --> 35:11.370
I watched the first one.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.415
I thought I was just
going to start,

35:13.459 --> 35:15.200
but then I got caught up.

35:15.243 --> 35:16.723
'Cause you like me.

35:16.766 --> 35:17.787
I might have to watch
the rest of them.

35:17.811 --> 35:19.073
I mean,

35:19.117 --> 35:20.442
just to see how it turns out
and stuff...

35:20.466 --> 35:21.423
You like me.

35:21.467 --> 35:22.729
Let me save you

35:22.772 --> 35:24.557
and stop before the last two.

35:25.732 --> 35:27.908
Make that the last four.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.744
Excuse me for a minute.

35:37.787 --> 35:39.572
Sure.

35:43.271 --> 35:45.578
Stop wasting your time.

35:45.621 --> 35:47.101
The answer is still no.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.103
Okay, just hear me out,
all right?

35:49.147 --> 35:53.412
We'll offer you twice
what we paid J Bar Ranch.

35:53.455 --> 35:54.413
J Bar...

35:54.456 --> 35:56.066
you practically grew up there.

35:56.110 --> 35:57.807
You loved that land.

35:57.851 --> 35:59.133
Now, what are you gonna do,
turn it into condos?

35:59.157 --> 36:00.375
A strip mall?

36:00.419 --> 36:02.136
Can't you see I'm trying
to help you, Heather?

36:02.160 --> 36:03.944
I mean, if you
turn down our offer,

36:03.987 --> 36:05.946
we're still going to
get this place at auction

36:05.989 --> 36:07.619
when the bank forecloses
at the end of the season.

36:07.643 --> 36:08.949
Not if we have a good season.

36:08.992 --> 36:11.386
You haven't had
a good season in years.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.127
Quit dreaming, Heather.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.191
I mean, just take the money,

36:14.215 --> 36:15.782
and you and Casey
will have enough

36:15.825 --> 36:16.783
to find another place
somewhere else.

36:16.826 --> 36:17.958
This isn't about money.

36:18.001 --> 36:19.481
This is our home.

36:19.525 --> 36:20.961
Now, get out.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.852
God, I mean, you want to
walk away with nothing?

36:22.876 --> 36:24.747
I think maybe
you should walk away.

36:24.791 --> 36:27.968
Well, this doesn't concern you.

36:28.011 --> 36:30.275
Do I look concerned?

36:31.972 --> 36:33.669
When you come to your senses,

36:33.713 --> 36:36.106
give me a call.

36:36.150 --> 36:37.171
When the phone doesn't ring,

36:37.195 --> 36:39.675
you'll know it's her.

36:43.331 --> 36:45.507
I took an improv class once.

36:45.551 --> 36:47.379
They said, you know,
make a strong choice

36:47.422 --> 36:48.597
and go with your instinct.

36:48.641 --> 36:49.903
Not bad.

36:49.946 --> 36:50.947
Yeah.

37:07.355 --> 37:09.836
Boot jack.

37:09.879 --> 37:11.490
There you go.

37:11.533 --> 37:12.665
And try these.

37:12.708 --> 37:13.753
They look used.

37:13.796 --> 37:15.058
They're buckskin.

37:15.102 --> 37:17.670
Trust me, they'll be
a lot more comfortable

37:17.713 --> 37:18.713
than those airport boots.

37:20.107 --> 37:24.024
Let me ask you,
that, that fellow, Guthrie.

37:24.067 --> 37:25.504
Is he the reason I'm here?

37:25.547 --> 37:28.811
I thought some good publicity
might change the tide.

37:28.855 --> 37:31.771
Yeah, well,
I ruined that for you.

37:31.814 --> 37:33.512
Nah, it's not your fault,

37:33.555 --> 37:35.688
and this is a long time coming.

37:35.731 --> 37:37.603
My family history is here.

37:37.646 --> 37:39.169
I just can't let it go
to those people.

37:39.213 --> 37:40.170
Who, developers?

37:40.214 --> 37:41.476
Yeah, the worst kind.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.391
No morals, lots of money.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.480
You know, they strip the land,

37:45.524 --> 37:47.177
pour some concrete,
throw up buildings.

37:47.221 --> 37:48.701
When J Bar Ranch wouldn't sell,

37:48.744 --> 37:51.007
someone went
and ran off their cattle,

37:51.051 --> 37:52.313
ruined their entire business.

37:52.357 --> 37:53.880
I grew up with Guthrie.

37:53.923 --> 37:56.075
He should know better than
to work for people like that.

37:56.099 --> 37:57.318
How much longer do you have?

37:57.362 --> 37:59.059
The loan comes due
at the end of season.

37:59.102 --> 38:01.540
And now...

38:01.583 --> 38:03.324
you two are shopping together.

38:03.368 --> 38:04.847
Apparently so.

38:04.891 --> 38:06.240
We're all out of
saddle blankets.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.391
I'll bring some more tomorrow.

38:07.415 --> 38:09.287
Mr. Ford!

38:09.330 --> 38:10.330
Good to see you again.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.247
You need to borrow
my reading glasses,

38:13.291 --> 38:14.814
you just let me know.

38:14.857 --> 38:16.076
Or he could just buy some

38:16.119 --> 38:18.078
without the pearl chain.

38:18.121 --> 38:19.361
Third aisle, by the fertilizer.

38:26.782 --> 38:28.262
No harm in looking.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.137
Heather,

38:34.181 --> 38:36.401
Lola and I have been
doing some talking,

38:36.444 --> 38:39.142
and we want to lend you
a little something,

38:39.186 --> 38:40.405
for the ranch.

38:41.754 --> 38:43.582
Thank you, both,

38:43.625 --> 38:45.888
but you know we can't
take your money.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.997
Besides, it's going to take
more than a little something

38:48.021 --> 38:49.327
to keep us going.

38:49.370 --> 38:51.285
I can't bear
to see them foreclose.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.505
This town won't be the same.

38:54.810 --> 38:56.769
I know.

38:56.812 --> 38:57.770
Hazelnut?

38:57.813 --> 38:59.511
Try one.

39:01.513 --> 39:02.751
You were right
about what you said,

39:02.775 --> 39:04.516
about modernizing?

39:04.559 --> 39:06.169
Probably should have.

39:06.213 --> 39:09.434
You know, Wi-Fi, video games,

39:09.477 --> 39:10.652
latte machine.

39:10.696 --> 39:12.828
Nah, you wanted to keep
the place authentic.

39:12.872 --> 39:14.830
People used to come here
for the experience.

39:14.874 --> 39:17.137
Not anymore.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.269
I might have been wrong,
about the modernizing.

39:19.313 --> 39:20.749
That's nice of you to say,

39:20.793 --> 39:23.404
but you're still mourning
the loss of your tablet.

39:23.448 --> 39:26.451
No, no, I had an awakening.

39:26.494 --> 39:28.975
Yeah, I don't have to
ask Siri about the weather,

39:29.018 --> 39:31.891
I can just step outside
and see for myself.

39:31.934 --> 39:33.719
Who knew?

39:33.762 --> 39:36.461
So when's your next
movie coming out?

39:36.504 --> 39:38.463
It's not.

39:38.506 --> 39:40.160
The studio dumped me.

39:40.203 --> 39:41.814
What, because of us?

39:41.857 --> 39:44.773
No, I think they've been
looking for an excuse.

39:44.817 --> 39:45.948
Truth is,

39:45.992 --> 39:47.448
I haven't really done
anything worthwhile

39:47.472 --> 39:50.344
in a long time, and...

39:50.388 --> 39:53.216
It was great at the beginning,

39:53.260 --> 39:55.436
you know, and I'm grateful,

39:55.480 --> 39:57.482
but lately, I just feel like

39:57.525 --> 40:00.006
I've been going
through the motions.

40:00.049 --> 40:02.182
Like a pair of boots
that don't fit anymore.

40:02.225 --> 40:03.792
Yeah, I reckon so.

40:03.836 --> 40:06.012
You know, I'm no expert,

40:06.055 --> 40:09.189
but you started acting
to escape your real life.

40:09.232 --> 40:11.496
When do you ever get
to live your real life?

40:11.539 --> 40:12.671
That's a good question.

40:12.714 --> 40:16.152
One trail ends,
another one begins.

40:16.196 --> 40:17.502
Yeah.

40:17.545 --> 40:19.591
Maybe we ought to get back.

40:28.469 --> 40:29.775
Good morning.

40:29.818 --> 40:31.211
Good morning.

40:31.254 --> 40:34.823
I...
I thought I'd see

40:34.867 --> 40:38.218
if I could, I don't know,
maybe give you a hand.

40:38.261 --> 40:39.480
You ever mend a fence?

40:39.524 --> 40:40.481
No.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.048
Here, grab this.

40:42.091 --> 40:44.877
Get your hands dirty,
get your mind off things.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.008
That sounds good to me.

40:46.052 --> 40:48.402
All right,
bring her down, that's it.

40:48.446 --> 40:49.403
That's got it.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.404
Is that it?

40:50.448 --> 40:51.536
Yeah, here.

40:51.579 --> 40:53.407
I'll take north, you take south.

40:55.191 --> 40:56.149
All right.

40:56.192 --> 40:57.150
Hook 'er up.

40:57.193 --> 40:58.238
I was in New York once.

40:58.281 --> 40:59.544
That's my town.

40:59.587 --> 41:02.024
Yeah, I didn't like it much.

41:02.068 --> 41:03.896
How long you been single?

41:03.939 --> 41:06.246
You know, a while.

41:06.289 --> 41:08.291
Yeah, that long?

41:08.335 --> 41:09.989
Well, I just always figured

41:10.032 --> 41:12.513
I'd do better by myself.

41:13.558 --> 41:15.211
Well, it's safer,
that's for sure.

41:15.255 --> 41:16.343
Can't get thrown.

41:16.386 --> 41:17.431
Grab that.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.128
Yeah, something like that.

41:20.303 --> 41:21.914
I was the same way once.

41:21.957 --> 41:25.265
You win a few buckles,
the girls start showing up.

41:25.308 --> 41:28.311
I thought that was
as good as it gets.

41:28.355 --> 41:31.750
Then I met Heather's mom,
and all that changed.

41:31.793 --> 41:34.970
How long were you guys married?

41:35.014 --> 41:36.842
40 years, all of them good.

41:36.885 --> 41:37.843
Wow.

41:37.886 --> 41:38.931
Yup.

41:38.974 --> 41:42.195
And then Heather moved back home

41:42.238 --> 41:43.718
after her mother passed.

41:43.762 --> 41:45.720
Didn't want to leave me alone.

41:45.764 --> 41:47.548
I worry about her
out here, though.

41:47.592 --> 41:48.873
Seems like she can
take care of herself.

41:48.897 --> 41:50.159
Yeah, she can ride, rope,

41:50.203 --> 41:51.465
fix the truck,

41:51.509 --> 41:54.555
whip up a meal that'll
knock your socks off.

41:54.599 --> 41:58.167
Nothing she can't do
except let down her guard.

41:59.342 --> 42:00.343
So, what do you think?

42:00.387 --> 42:02.084
About what?

42:02.128 --> 42:03.521
My daughter.

42:03.564 --> 42:06.785
Well, she's...
she's pretty smart.

42:06.828 --> 42:08.134
She's quick,

42:08.177 --> 42:09.614
not hard to look at...

42:09.657 --> 42:10.615
So you think she's a catch?

42:10.658 --> 42:11.616
Yeah.

42:11.659 --> 42:14.096
For-for someone.

42:14.140 --> 42:15.533
Am I making you uncomfortable?

42:15.576 --> 42:16.925
Like a saddle full of nails.

42:18.492 --> 42:19.600
You should use that
in one of your movies.

42:19.624 --> 42:20.799
I did.

42:20.842 --> 42:23.323
Twice.

42:23.366 --> 42:25.325
So, what do you know
about big-screen TVs?

42:25.368 --> 42:26.805
Well, big-screen TVs,

42:26.848 --> 42:30.112
that is an area
where I am the expert.

42:30.156 --> 42:32.114
I figured we'd hit
on one eventually.

42:33.507 --> 42:34.615
You're going to
get a big screen?

42:34.639 --> 42:35.814
I've been thinking about it.

42:35.857 --> 42:38.338
Don't say anything to Heather.

42:38.381 --> 42:39.948
32? 40-inch?

42:39.992 --> 42:41.341
I was thinking 50.

42:41.384 --> 42:43.299
Wow, are you ready
to see those old Westerns

42:43.343 --> 42:45.127
in Hi-Def?

42:45.171 --> 42:46.825
What's Hi-Def?

42:57.400 --> 42:58.532
You missed it.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.360
Your father's been
dispensing some wisdom.

43:00.403 --> 43:01.753
Well, when a cowboy gets too old

43:01.796 --> 43:02.971
to set a bad example,

43:03.015 --> 43:04.320
he offers good advice.

43:04.364 --> 43:05.321
See you, kids.

43:05.365 --> 43:07.759
Have fun.

43:07.802 --> 43:09.195
You remember Buttercup.

43:09.238 --> 43:11.153
Vividly.

43:11.197 --> 43:13.852
She would like to apologize.

43:13.895 --> 43:16.158
No really, that's...
That's not necessary.

43:16.202 --> 43:17.246
Okay, thanks.

43:17.290 --> 43:19.292
Thanks... I think.

43:21.163 --> 43:22.663
Just so you know,
when you climb on a horse,

43:22.687 --> 43:25.428
you want to grab the reins,
not just the saddle horn.

43:25.472 --> 43:26.623
Yeah, and you tell me this why?

43:26.647 --> 43:28.649
Because then your horse
knows you're boss,

43:28.693 --> 43:31.130
and what, you want to be
a virtual cowboy

43:31.173 --> 43:32.348
or a real one?

43:32.392 --> 43:34.350
It'd take a few more days
than you have.

43:34.394 --> 43:35.961
God made the world in six.

43:36.004 --> 43:37.963
Yeah, he had more to work with.

43:38.006 --> 43:39.834
You got off to a bad start.

43:39.878 --> 43:43.316
You never had something bad
end up in something good?

43:43.359 --> 43:45.535
No, never.
Not-not once.

43:45.579 --> 43:47.189
All right, well then, hop over.

43:47.233 --> 43:48.538
Come on.

43:48.582 --> 43:49.888
Get over here.

43:49.931 --> 43:52.194
Come on, climb over the fence.

43:53.761 --> 43:55.197
Yeah, that's it

43:55.241 --> 43:56.392
Yeah, see, you got
the hang of it.

43:56.416 --> 43:57.373
There, see?

43:57.417 --> 43:59.854
Yes, I can climb.

43:59.898 --> 44:00.855
All right, so,
just so we're straight,

44:00.899 --> 44:02.050
this is the front of the horse,

44:02.074 --> 44:03.225
that is the back of the horse.

44:03.249 --> 44:04.642
Well, I know about the back.

44:04.685 --> 44:05.773
Yes, you do.

44:05.817 --> 44:07.775
Now, grab the reins, hop on.

44:07.819 --> 44:08.733
These?

44:08.776 --> 44:09.995
Put your... Yeah.

44:10.038 --> 44:11.866
Yeah, put your left foot
in that stirrup.

44:11.910 --> 44:13.041
This I got.

44:13.085 --> 44:14.173
That's right,

44:14.216 --> 44:15.367
and make sure
you grab the saddle horn.

44:15.391 --> 44:17.872
One, two, three....
swing up.

44:17.916 --> 44:18.873
Swing your leg up,

44:18.917 --> 44:20.048
there you go.

44:20.092 --> 44:21.833
All right, grab
that other stirrup.

44:21.876 --> 44:22.877
Yeah.

44:22.921 --> 44:24.052
Okay, now...

44:24.096 --> 44:26.054
give him a little squeeze
with your knees.

44:26.098 --> 44:27.055
For what?

44:27.099 --> 44:28.404
To send him forward.

44:28.448 --> 44:29.686
All right?
Just a little squeeze.

44:29.710 --> 44:30.668
All right.

44:30.711 --> 44:31.669
Just a little bit.
There you go.

44:31.712 --> 44:33.018
Ha ha.

44:33.061 --> 44:34.193
When in doubt,

44:34.236 --> 44:36.369
you let your horse
do the thinking, okay?

44:36.412 --> 44:37.587
Yeah, I have no choice.

44:37.631 --> 44:39.633
You want to go a little faster,

44:39.677 --> 44:40.915
you give him another
little squeeze.

44:40.939 --> 44:42.288
Yeah, what if
I want to go slower?

44:42.331 --> 44:43.744
You go any slower,
you won't be moving.

44:43.768 --> 44:45.204
That's not so bad.

44:45.247 --> 44:46.268
All right, there you go,
good luck.

44:46.292 --> 44:47.249
Don't let it...

44:47.293 --> 44:48.250
don't let it go.

44:48.294 --> 44:49.904
Yeah, you're a natural.

44:49.948 --> 44:52.254
I... Hold up, wait.
Hey, hey!

44:52.298 --> 44:53.255
It's not stopping.

44:53.299 --> 44:54.256
It's...

44:54.300 --> 44:55.910
Buttercup will be a good girl.

44:55.954 --> 44:57.520
Wait, hey...

44:57.564 --> 44:59.740
Wait, wait, I lost the rope.

44:59.784 --> 45:00.959
You all right there?

45:01.002 --> 45:01.960
I'm better now.

45:02.003 --> 45:02.961
You got it?
All right.

45:03.004 --> 45:04.266
Okay.

45:04.310 --> 45:06.747
All right, I'm coming.

45:08.923 --> 45:10.403
There you go,

45:10.446 --> 45:11.467
you're getting the hang of it.

45:11.491 --> 45:12.622
Yeah.

45:12.666 --> 45:14.102
Okay.

45:14.146 --> 45:16.191
Now, turn her around,

45:16.235 --> 45:17.584
go to your left.

45:17.627 --> 45:19.127
Just take your reins,
put them in one hand.

45:19.151 --> 45:21.240
Yeah, one hand.

45:21.283 --> 45:22.763
Now you're going
in a circle, okay.

45:22.807 --> 45:23.851
There you go.

45:23.895 --> 45:24.765
Send her forward a little bit...

45:24.809 --> 45:25.766
Where are you?

45:25.810 --> 45:27.289
I'm right here to your left.

45:27.333 --> 45:28.290
There!

45:28.334 --> 45:30.466
Keep your center
of gravity here,

45:30.510 --> 45:31.946
point your sternum
up to the sky,

45:31.990 --> 45:36.124
roll your shoulders back,
just relax your body.

45:36.168 --> 45:37.865
Sure...

45:52.271 --> 45:53.925
I gotta say,

45:53.968 --> 45:57.493
this place does have
a certain charm.

45:57.537 --> 45:59.800
In an unpopulated,

45:59.844 --> 46:02.890
desolate sort of way.

46:05.284 --> 46:06.981
Check this.

46:11.507 --> 46:12.813
You learn that on the Internet?

46:12.857 --> 46:14.162
No way.

46:14.206 --> 46:16.164
Public pool in Queens.

46:16.208 --> 46:17.470
That's how I got this scar.

46:17.513 --> 46:19.298
One ricocheted, broke the tile.

46:19.341 --> 46:22.518
Okay, you call that a scar?
This is a scar.

46:22.562 --> 46:23.737
Branding iron.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.521
All right.

46:27.175 --> 46:28.829
Espresso-maker exploded.

46:28.873 --> 46:31.484
Long-horned steer.

46:33.181 --> 46:34.313
Dog bite.

46:34.356 --> 46:35.531
What kind of dog?

46:35.575 --> 46:36.532
Pomeranian.

46:36.576 --> 46:38.056
Those are, like, two pounds.

46:38.099 --> 46:39.622
Yeah, two pounds of terror.

46:39.666 --> 46:41.929
Is that why
you're afraid of animals?

46:41.973 --> 46:43.365
No, I'm not afraid of them,

46:43.409 --> 46:45.628
I've just never really
been around them very much.

46:45.672 --> 46:47.239
You never had a pet?

46:47.282 --> 46:48.682
No, that would
require a commitment.

46:48.718 --> 46:50.285
You know, when you
grow up by yourself,

46:50.329 --> 46:52.548
you just take care of yourself.

46:52.592 --> 46:55.987
Sounds kind of lonely.

46:56.030 --> 46:57.684
I don't see you
with a prom date.

46:57.727 --> 46:59.947
I'm taking a break
at the moment.

46:59.991 --> 47:02.167
How long of a break
are you taking?

47:03.211 --> 47:04.822
Let's just say there's...

47:04.865 --> 47:08.913
nothing like the scar
from a broken heart.

47:08.956 --> 47:10.871
Cowboy?

47:10.915 --> 47:12.133
Wall-Streeter.

47:13.395 --> 47:15.354
Met in college, got married,

47:15.397 --> 47:16.877
got unmarried.

47:16.921 --> 47:18.531
I thought we wanted
the same thing,

47:18.574 --> 47:21.751
but turns out he cared more
about his career than family.

47:21.795 --> 47:25.625
My Mom fell ill,
he took a job back east,

47:25.668 --> 47:28.715
and I came home
and never went back.

47:28.758 --> 47:31.761
So he was a city-slicker
and a jerk.

47:31.805 --> 47:33.459
Afraid so.

47:34.503 --> 47:36.897
Wow, that's a toxic combination.

47:36.941 --> 47:37.961
You know, I can kind of see

47:37.985 --> 47:40.379
why you don't really like me.

47:40.422 --> 47:41.380
You're not a jerk,

47:41.423 --> 47:42.381
and I never said
I didn't like you,

47:42.424 --> 47:43.599
I said you were a fraud.

47:43.643 --> 47:44.600
So what, you do like me?

47:44.644 --> 47:45.775
How's your head?

47:45.819 --> 47:46.907
Still attached.

47:46.951 --> 47:48.430
All right, I'll race you back.

47:48.474 --> 47:49.562
Race?

47:49.605 --> 47:51.303
Wait a minute, I don't even...

47:57.657 --> 47:58.788
Let's go.

47:58.832 --> 48:00.834
Get.

48:07.623 --> 48:10.800
- Morning.
- Morning.

48:10.844 --> 48:11.801
I'm surprised to see you awake.

48:11.845 --> 48:13.542
Surprised to be awake.

48:13.586 --> 48:16.023
Well, I had an opening,
I thought I'd check in with you.

48:16.067 --> 48:17.987
Yeah? What, did you have
a rooster cancel on you?

48:22.812 --> 48:24.336
The bump
on your head's subsided.

48:25.598 --> 48:27.382
Any dizziness, memory,

48:27.426 --> 48:28.340
vision problems?

48:28.383 --> 48:30.124
No, I actually feel better

48:30.168 --> 48:31.952
than I have in a long time.

48:31.996 --> 48:33.258
This place will do that to you.

48:33.301 --> 48:37.218
I've stayed in the cabin
a couple times myself.

48:37.262 --> 48:39.655
Fond memories.

48:39.699 --> 48:40.700
Okay.

48:40.743 --> 48:41.962
That's that.

48:42.006 --> 48:43.572
What's that?

48:43.616 --> 48:45.879
You are free to fly.

48:45.923 --> 48:47.228
It's only been two days.

48:47.272 --> 48:48.510
- Correct.
- But you said a week.

48:48.534 --> 48:51.145
Well, over-cautious on my part.

48:51.189 --> 48:52.842
But you've healed nicely.

48:52.886 --> 48:54.975
So I can get on a plane?

48:55.019 --> 48:56.150
Fly away.

48:56.194 --> 48:57.978
You are free
to move around the cabin.

48:58.022 --> 49:01.155
Great.

49:02.374 --> 49:04.158
I thought you'd be more pleased,

49:04.202 --> 49:05.333
since, you know,

49:05.377 --> 49:06.987
you were so eager
to get out of here.

49:07.031 --> 49:08.031
Yeah, right.

49:09.294 --> 49:10.686
So, what do I owe you?

49:10.730 --> 49:12.297
- Nothing.
- You're sure?

49:12.340 --> 49:13.994
Yeah.
The Twains are friends.

49:14.038 --> 49:16.605
Although...

49:16.649 --> 49:18.999
I wouldn't say no
to an autograph.

49:19.043 --> 49:20.827
Not a problem.

49:22.350 --> 49:23.482
Who do I make this out to?

49:23.525 --> 49:25.049
- Francis.
- Francis.

49:25.092 --> 49:26.572
Is that your wife?
Daughter?

49:26.615 --> 49:27.660
No, that's me.

49:29.009 --> 49:30.837
Frank is short for Francis.

49:30.880 --> 49:31.881
Sorry about that.

49:31.925 --> 49:33.274
- You and me both.
- There you go.

49:33.318 --> 49:34.667
Thank you.

49:34.710 --> 49:37.713
Hey, doc, um...

49:37.757 --> 49:39.977
We have doctor-patient
confidentially, right?

49:40.020 --> 49:41.543
You do recall I'm a vet?

49:41.587 --> 49:42.718
The thing is...

49:42.762 --> 49:44.720
I'd like to stay here
another day,

49:44.764 --> 49:45.939
maybe two.

49:45.983 --> 49:47.221
- Because it's so peaceful?
- Exactly.

49:47.245 --> 49:49.334
You know, you're not
the first guest

49:49.377 --> 49:50.770
to fall for Heather Twain.

49:52.424 --> 49:53.555
Don't worry about it.

49:53.599 --> 49:55.557
I won't say anything.

49:55.601 --> 49:58.386
Just don't go
breaking her heart?

50:03.696 --> 50:05.741
Absolutely, yes.

50:05.785 --> 50:07.961
That sounds perfect.

50:08.005 --> 50:10.659
I will hold two rooms for you.

50:10.703 --> 50:12.270
Okay. Thank you.

50:12.313 --> 50:13.575
Bye-bye.

50:34.770 --> 50:35.902
Hey.

50:35.945 --> 50:37.556
Howdy, ma'am.

50:40.080 --> 50:41.734
Is that blueberry pie?

50:41.777 --> 50:42.735
Your favorite, right?

50:42.778 --> 50:43.910
Yeah, but how'd you know?

50:43.953 --> 50:45.085
You ate it in your movies.

50:45.129 --> 50:46.782
I figured
at least that part was real.

50:50.003 --> 50:53.920
Wow, this is good!

50:53.963 --> 50:55.487
I wanted to thank you.

50:55.530 --> 50:56.705
For what?

50:56.749 --> 51:00.057
Well, we booked out
opening week,

51:00.100 --> 51:01.754
and two weeks in May.

51:01.797 --> 51:04.235
Apparently, your stunt ride
put us back on the map.

51:04.278 --> 51:05.932
I can make a fool
out of myself any time.

51:05.975 --> 51:07.586
If it helps, I'll do it again.

51:07.629 --> 51:09.501
I'm sure it's bound to happen.

51:09.544 --> 51:11.546
You're stuck here for
the rest of the week, right?

51:11.590 --> 51:13.026
Right.

51:13.070 --> 51:15.222
Right, well, I guess we'll just
suffer through it, then.

51:15.246 --> 51:16.421
You know, I was thinking,

51:16.464 --> 51:17.291
as long as I'm here,
I should help out.

51:17.335 --> 51:19.598
Yeah? With what?

51:19.641 --> 51:20.947
Ranch stuff.

51:20.990 --> 51:22.992
- You ever chop wood?
- I've chopped a salad.

51:23.036 --> 51:24.168
Mend a fence?

51:24.211 --> 51:25.778
One of my characters did once.

51:27.562 --> 51:28.781
It was good.

51:28.824 --> 51:30.304
I was a fence-mender.

51:44.188 --> 51:45.188
Mr. Ford!

51:47.495 --> 51:49.280
Um, that picture of you
on Instagram,

51:49.323 --> 51:50.803
it got me, like,
9,000 followers.

51:50.846 --> 51:53.632
9,000?

51:53.675 --> 51:55.938
All right, let's see
if we can go for 10.

51:57.026 --> 51:58.898
There you go.

51:58.941 --> 52:00.813
Great. Thank you
very much.

52:00.856 --> 52:02.162
No sweat.

52:13.521 --> 52:15.175
Hey...

52:15.219 --> 52:17.395
You two are just joined
at the hip, aren't you?

52:17.438 --> 52:19.484
- Yeah.
- No.

52:19.527 --> 52:21.355
These are beautiful.

52:21.399 --> 52:22.487
Where should I put them?

52:22.530 --> 52:25.664
Wheelbarrows?
End of the aisle?

52:25.707 --> 52:27.144
Here, for the last batch.

52:27.187 --> 52:29.015
Thanks.

52:29.058 --> 52:30.625
Listen,

52:30.669 --> 52:32.105
I'm just gonna
go out on a limb here

52:32.149 --> 52:34.847
and say that there's
something going on

52:34.890 --> 52:36.196
between you two.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.565
Well, don't go too far
out on that limb,

52:37.589 --> 52:39.417
it might break off.

52:39.460 --> 52:43.899
Okay, he's not as bad
as I thought.

52:45.249 --> 52:46.598
You didn't have to buy that.

52:46.641 --> 52:48.513
You don't even own a horse.

52:48.556 --> 52:51.690
Well, not yet,
but I do have a couch,

52:51.733 --> 52:53.053
and this would
look great on that.

52:55.259 --> 52:56.303
You hear that?

52:56.347 --> 52:57.565
That sounds like a party.

52:57.609 --> 52:59.741
You might want to
steer clear of that.

52:59.785 --> 53:03.049
No... this is
what I do.

53:04.572 --> 53:06.270
Welcome to our 14th annual
Chili Cook-off.

53:07.749 --> 53:09.074
We got the usual suspects
this year.

53:09.098 --> 53:10.491
I'm open to a bribe...

53:11.753 --> 53:13.407
And what do we got over here?

53:13.451 --> 53:15.080
Better keep
the fire extinguisher handy

53:15.104 --> 53:16.367
on that one.

53:17.933 --> 53:19.084
It's gonna be a good one
this year, folks.

53:19.108 --> 53:20.414
I'm looking forward to it.

53:20.458 --> 53:22.721
Is that Avery under that hat?

53:22.764 --> 53:25.332
What's left of me, yeah.

53:25.376 --> 53:27.378
Looks like we have ourselves
a celebrity judge.

53:27.421 --> 53:28.683
Avery Ford!

53:31.599 --> 53:33.427
Here you go,
you're going to need this.

53:35.124 --> 53:38.737
I hope you like chili.

53:57.451 --> 53:58.887
That's good.

54:00.324 --> 54:03.152
Yeah.

54:06.112 --> 54:07.592
That's good, too.

54:13.293 --> 54:15.252
Okay, that's got
a little kick to it.

54:19.125 --> 54:20.692
That's spicy, wow.

54:23.303 --> 54:24.348
Sweet and sassy.

54:26.132 --> 54:28.090
No, that's not very good.

54:29.309 --> 54:31.137
No, I'm kidding,
that is fabulous!

54:32.617 --> 54:36.925
Avery, you're about to make
one friend and five enemies.

54:41.147 --> 54:42.888
I don't know if you could tell,

54:42.931 --> 54:45.282
but when I first got here,

54:45.325 --> 54:47.414
I wasn't really at home.

54:47.458 --> 54:49.416
I know that horse could tell.

54:50.635 --> 54:51.699
So I'd like to thank you
for the honor

54:51.723 --> 54:53.290
of allowing me

54:53.333 --> 54:56.075
to judge some of the best
dang chili

54:56.118 --> 54:57.424
that I ever 'et.

54:58.599 --> 54:59.557
It's been a tough choice,

54:59.600 --> 55:01.820
but the winner is...

55:01.863 --> 55:03.343
bowl number three.

55:10.263 --> 55:11.308
I did it!

55:47.126 --> 55:48.083
Sorry. I just got
your messages.

55:48.127 --> 55:50.085
Well, it's been a week.

55:50.129 --> 55:51.826
When are you coming back?

55:51.870 --> 55:53.219
I need more time.

55:53.262 --> 55:54.307
For what?

55:54.351 --> 55:55.874
Well, I'm riding a horse now.

55:55.917 --> 55:57.223
For real.

55:57.266 --> 55:58.679
Congratulations.
You can tell it to the studio,

55:58.703 --> 56:01.009
'cause we're meeting with them
tomorrow night.

56:01.053 --> 56:03.403
I just can't come back now.

56:03.447 --> 56:05.666
You know how hard it was
for me to get this meeting,

56:05.710 --> 56:07.015
right, Avery?

56:07.059 --> 56:07.712
I mean, your career's
not exactly

56:07.755 --> 56:08.800
on fire right now.

56:08.843 --> 56:11.237
Candace. I gotta go.

56:11.280 --> 56:13.892
Where could you possibly
have to go?

56:13.935 --> 56:16.547
I gotta see a man about a TV.

56:16.590 --> 56:17.722
Av...

56:17.765 --> 56:20.725
Avery? Avery?

56:20.768 --> 56:21.726
H'yah!

56:21.769 --> 56:23.075
Look at that.

56:23.118 --> 56:25.338
We can't accept this.

56:25.382 --> 56:26.644
Yes, we can.

56:26.687 --> 56:28.361
I'm happy to do it.
I got a great deal on it.

56:28.385 --> 56:29.864
I got a cousin, you know...

56:29.908 --> 56:31.257
Get out of the canyon.

56:31.300 --> 56:32.737
I love this scene.

56:32.780 --> 56:34.216
Nobody rides a horse
like the Duke.

56:34.260 --> 56:35.261
You see that move?

56:35.304 --> 56:36.523
Yeah, that was pretty sweet.

56:36.567 --> 56:38.090
I'm going to go check on Curly.

56:38.133 --> 56:39.396
I think I'll go with you.

56:39.439 --> 56:41.746
You and I should have
a little chat first.

56:41.789 --> 56:43.008
Dad...

56:43.051 --> 56:44.313
He'll catch up.
Sit.

56:48.753 --> 56:50.885
You still have
a lot to learn, son,

56:50.929 --> 56:52.452
and I'm not talking
about ranching.

56:52.496 --> 56:54.367
Well, what are you
talking about?

56:54.411 --> 56:56.456
- My daughter.
- Did I do something wrong?

56:56.500 --> 56:58.565
Not yet, but I've seen the way
you two look at each other.

56:58.589 --> 57:00.112
I know she's a grown-up,

57:00.155 --> 57:01.481
but I don't want Heather
thinking one thing

57:01.505 --> 57:02.636
when it's another.

57:02.680 --> 57:04.464
I-I don't either.

57:04.508 --> 57:05.465
So we're on the same page?

57:05.509 --> 57:07.598
I will be a perfect gentleman.

57:07.641 --> 57:09.208
Anyone can be a gentleman.

57:09.251 --> 57:10.620
Don't tell her
anything you don't mean.

57:10.644 --> 57:13.647
Be a cowboy.

57:21.176 --> 57:22.526
How bad?

57:22.569 --> 57:25.137
I haven't been given the talk
by a girl's dad

57:25.180 --> 57:26.486
since high school.

57:27.966 --> 57:30.795
He's been giving that talk
since I was in high school.

57:30.838 --> 57:33.188
Yeah, he just wants to
look after you.

57:33.232 --> 57:35.277
I can handle myself.

57:35.321 --> 57:36.757
Yeah, I have no doubt.

57:36.801 --> 57:38.498
Did you know,

57:38.542 --> 57:39.499
"In the bonny bells of Heather,

57:39.543 --> 57:41.806
"They brewed a drink long-syne,

57:41.849 --> 57:43.634
"'Twas sweeter far than honey,

57:43.677 --> 57:46.506
stronger far than wine."

57:46.550 --> 57:48.073
Robert Louis Stevenson.

57:48.116 --> 57:49.640
I was trying to impress you.

57:49.683 --> 57:50.684
You did.

57:50.728 --> 57:53.557
My Dad named me after that poem.

57:53.600 --> 57:55.472
Who named you Avery?

57:55.515 --> 57:57.125
I did.

57:57.169 --> 57:58.189
Yeah, the sisters
named me Timothy Vincent

57:58.213 --> 57:59.171
after the saint.

57:59.214 --> 58:00.477
I never really felt like one.

58:00.520 --> 58:03.088
Avery was the town
I was born in.

58:03.131 --> 58:04.089
And Ford?

58:04.132 --> 58:05.960
A broken-down Ford Galaxie.

58:06.004 --> 58:06.961
Yeah, the Reverend Mother,

58:07.005 --> 58:09.311
she would drive us to birthdays,

58:09.355 --> 58:10.463
and I would sit
in the back seat.

58:10.487 --> 58:12.097
Back there, I always thought

58:12.140 --> 58:13.968
I would get my own car someday.

58:14.012 --> 58:16.449
Drive, see all the stuff
I would want to see.

58:16.493 --> 58:17.644
But you never learned to drive?

58:17.668 --> 58:18.973
Nope.

58:19.017 --> 58:21.280
You know what
I think we should do?

58:23.674 --> 58:25.110
I got some ideas.

58:25.153 --> 58:28.287
Meet me behind the barn.

58:33.553 --> 58:36.382
I like the sound of that.

58:39.690 --> 58:41.735
What...?

58:41.779 --> 58:43.128
When you said,
"Behind the barn,"

58:43.171 --> 58:45.304
this wasn't exactly
what I was thinking about.

58:45.347 --> 58:47.088
Hop on, you're driving.

58:47.132 --> 58:49.177
It's been a while
since I drove one of these.

58:49.221 --> 58:50.570
It's a piece of cake.

58:50.614 --> 58:52.659
Plus, there's nothing
for you to crash into.

58:52.703 --> 58:53.878
Trees,

58:53.921 --> 58:55.140
fences.

58:55.183 --> 58:57.969
All right, brake's
on your right,

58:58.012 --> 58:59.013
clutch is on your left,

58:59.057 --> 59:00.188
this is your gas, okay?

59:00.232 --> 59:01.625
Yeah, I play video games,

59:01.668 --> 59:02.669
I got this.

59:02.713 --> 59:05.280
Okay, well then,
I'm in good hands.

59:08.196 --> 59:09.850
I could get used to this.

59:09.894 --> 59:14.202
Might have a problem
parking in Manhattan.

59:14.246 --> 59:16.248
This is nice.

59:16.291 --> 59:19.425
Yeah, it is.

59:20.426 --> 59:22.036
Whoa, bit bumpy.

59:23.081 --> 59:25.213
You did that on purpose.

59:33.787 --> 59:37.399
I am so sorry, sweet Sarah.

59:37.443 --> 59:40.011
All I ever wanted was a wife,

59:40.054 --> 59:42.056
and a family,

59:42.100 --> 59:44.015
some sons.

59:49.237 --> 59:51.065
See you.

59:58.899 --> 01:00:00.597
I'm getting in
over my head here.

01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:04.644
No, you're right.

01:00:04.688 --> 01:00:08.692
I should tell her how I feel.

01:00:21.574 --> 01:00:22.836
Curly, girl, no.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.100
No, we're not going to
do this now, are we?

01:00:26.144 --> 01:00:28.363
I've got to get some help.

01:00:28.407 --> 01:00:30.452
This is happening right now.

01:00:30.496 --> 01:00:33.107
Is this happening now?

01:00:35.153 --> 01:00:36.720
Okay...

01:00:46.817 --> 01:00:48.122
Hey.

01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:50.429
Why didn't you get me?

01:00:50.472 --> 01:00:52.126
Well, there's a bit
of a time crunch.

01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:53.693
Plus, we did okay.

01:00:53.737 --> 01:00:56.261
We had it under control.

01:00:57.958 --> 01:00:59.307
Congratulations.

01:00:59.351 --> 01:01:00.308
Thank you.

01:01:00.352 --> 01:01:01.396
I was talking to Curly.

01:01:02.441 --> 01:01:03.442
But I am impressed.

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:05.792
Mozart?

01:01:05.836 --> 01:01:07.141
Yeah.

01:01:07.185 --> 01:01:08.505
It's good
for spatial development,

01:01:08.534 --> 01:01:09.642
you know, according to Siri.

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.537
Siri does realize they're pigs?

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.974
Curly and I, yeah,
we're picking out names.

01:01:14.018 --> 01:01:15.541
See that studly one
on the right there?

01:01:15.584 --> 01:01:18.109
That's Avery, yep...
and that's his sister.

01:01:18.152 --> 01:01:19.501
Her name's Maybeth.

01:01:19.545 --> 01:01:21.175
I'll bring a box
and we'll move them to the barn.

01:01:21.199 --> 01:01:23.288
No, no, no, not to the barn.

01:01:23.331 --> 01:01:24.571
That would be like a downgrade.

01:01:27.596 --> 01:01:29.207
Want to share your room
with pigs?

01:01:30.948 --> 01:01:32.863
Yeah, I think I do.

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:41.306
He makes a good midwife.

01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:45.266
In fact, he seems
right at home here.

01:01:46.224 --> 01:01:48.574
You seem pretty happy
yourself these days.

01:01:48.617 --> 01:01:50.402
Well, we booked up
half April and May.

01:01:50.445 --> 01:01:52.317
Well, that is good news.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.275
The ranch is back on the map,

01:01:54.319 --> 01:01:55.320
and so is Dad.

01:01:55.363 --> 01:01:56.800
People are remembering him.

01:01:56.843 --> 01:01:58.062
And so they should...

01:01:58.105 --> 01:01:59.977
but I was thinking
of something else.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.761
Well,
whatever you were thinking,

01:02:01.805 --> 01:02:03.502
don't.

01:02:03.545 --> 01:02:06.070
He'll be gone in a few days,
and that'll be that.

01:02:06.113 --> 01:02:07.506
Sweetheart,

01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:09.595
if he wanted to leave,
he'd be long gone already.

01:02:09.638 --> 01:02:11.815
What do you mean?

01:02:11.858 --> 01:02:12.990
Well...

01:02:13.033 --> 01:02:15.035
doctor-patient confidentiality.

01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:19.648
I told him he could
fly out of here days ago.

01:02:19.692 --> 01:02:21.172
What?

01:02:21.215 --> 01:02:22.347
His head's fine.

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:24.871
It's his heart
that's been affected...

01:02:24.915 --> 01:02:27.439
and maybe yours, too?

01:02:31.573 --> 01:02:33.750
I know I said it's better
to be safe than sorry,

01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:36.230
but there is such a thing
as being too safe.

01:02:48.982 --> 01:02:50.027
"Hay!"

01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:51.332
Big bales of it.

01:02:51.376 --> 01:02:53.006
You know, you don't have to
do all that work.

01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:56.163
I know, but...
I want to.

01:02:56.207 --> 01:02:59.558
You ever slept outside,
under the stars?

01:02:59.601 --> 01:03:01.821
I...

01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:03.867
spent the night
on a fire escape once.

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:05.390
'Course, that was
my doorman's fault.

01:03:05.433 --> 01:03:07.044
You have a doorman?

01:03:07.087 --> 01:03:09.960
Yeah, Fred.
He's indispensable.

01:03:10.961 --> 01:03:12.397
So...

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.573
you'd have to
open your own doors.

01:03:14.616 --> 01:03:16.880
And close them, too.

01:03:16.923 --> 01:03:18.925
Well, how about tonight?

01:03:20.622 --> 01:03:22.973
Yeah.

01:03:23.016 --> 01:03:24.211
I think I see why it is

01:03:24.235 --> 01:03:26.193
you're going to miss this place
so much.

01:03:26.237 --> 01:03:30.067
That doesn't sound like a guy
with mechanical crickets.

01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:32.373
It's not.

01:03:32.417 --> 01:03:33.940
I think I get it now.

01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:37.639
I believe you do.

01:03:39.598 --> 01:03:41.687
And since I am the reason
that you're so booked up,

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:43.384
I figure
I should probably stick around,

01:03:43.428 --> 01:03:44.603
you know, help you guys out,

01:03:44.646 --> 01:03:47.388
deliver some more livestock.

01:03:47.432 --> 01:03:49.913
Well, we do have a foal due
in winter.

01:03:49.956 --> 01:03:51.610
You inviting me
to stay the winter?

01:03:51.653 --> 01:03:53.525
I don't know if
we'll still be here in winter.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:57.485
Well, then I guess
I should do this now.

01:04:07.887 --> 01:04:08.975
Hello!

01:04:17.462 --> 01:04:18.767
What are you wearing?

01:04:18.811 --> 01:04:19.812
Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh...

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:20.813
What are you doing here?

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.119
I'm taking you home,

01:04:22.162 --> 01:04:24.002
since you seem to have
forgotten where that is.

01:04:24.817 --> 01:04:25.818
This is Heather Twain.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:27.254
Heather, this is...
Candace.

01:04:27.298 --> 01:04:28.255
She's my manager.

01:04:28.299 --> 01:04:29.648
Well...

01:04:29.691 --> 01:04:31.693
we're a little more than that,
aren't we, Avery?

01:04:31.737 --> 01:04:32.956
No.

01:04:32.999 --> 01:04:35.654
Nice to meet you.
We spoke on the phone.

01:04:35.697 --> 01:04:37.351
Yes, when you told me
that him coming here

01:04:37.395 --> 01:04:38.676
was going to be good
for his career.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.788
Candace...

01:04:39.832 --> 01:04:41.181
You have to admit,

01:04:41.225 --> 01:04:43.159
this little excursion
hasn't exactly been helpful.

01:04:43.183 --> 01:04:44.706
I disagree.

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:47.231
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need anything.

01:04:47.274 --> 01:04:49.886
I'd love
a Pellegrino water... flat.

01:04:49.929 --> 01:04:51.539
We have fresh water.
It's from the lake.

01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:53.585
I'll see what I can do.

01:04:56.762 --> 01:04:58.503
"We?"
Don't tell me

01:04:58.546 --> 01:05:00.220
you're actually taking
this cowboy thing seriously.

01:05:00.244 --> 01:05:01.375
What if I am?

01:05:01.419 --> 01:05:03.900
Then put it in your next role...

01:05:03.943 --> 01:05:05.902
and there will be one.

01:05:05.945 --> 01:05:07.468
I met with the studio.

01:05:07.512 --> 01:05:08.426
When?

01:05:08.469 --> 01:05:10.210
Yesterday.

01:05:10.254 --> 01:05:11.385
They've agreed to overlook

01:05:11.429 --> 01:05:13.039
the little horse fiasco thing

01:05:13.083 --> 01:05:15.389
in exchange for the
next three installments

01:05:15.433 --> 01:05:16.825
of "Aim To Please."

01:05:16.869 --> 01:05:17.957
Installments?

01:05:18.001 --> 01:05:19.567
That's what
they're calling sequels now?

01:05:19.611 --> 01:05:21.700
They're going to be
exclusively released online,

01:05:21.743 --> 01:05:24.355
and your fee will be
considerably less, as mine,

01:05:24.398 --> 01:05:27.619
but if this thing takes off,
we'll just renegotiate.

01:05:27.662 --> 01:05:28.881
Yeah.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.709
Thank you?

01:05:32.754 --> 01:05:35.018
Well, I thought
you'd be more excited.

01:05:35.061 --> 01:05:37.716
Yeah, me too.

01:05:39.587 --> 01:05:41.633
Look, I can tell

01:05:41.676 --> 01:05:43.722
that you are going
through something,

01:05:43.765 --> 01:05:45.811
but it'll pass, it always does.

01:05:45.854 --> 01:05:47.223
Let's just get you back
into your clothes

01:05:47.247 --> 01:05:48.553
and get you out of here.

01:05:48.596 --> 01:05:49.902
I booked us a hotel in Billings.

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:52.992
Nonsense.
You'll stay here.

01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:55.386
That would be
very kind, Mr. Twain,

01:05:55.429 --> 01:05:57.214
but we fly out in the morning,

01:05:57.257 --> 01:05:58.408
and we have meetings
all day tomorrow.

01:05:58.432 --> 01:05:59.583
You'll stay here. I insist...

01:05:59.607 --> 01:06:00.913
and it isn't kind.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:02.238
I need Avery to finish
mucking out his stalls.

01:06:02.262 --> 01:06:03.437
I'll get my pitchfork.

01:06:12.098 --> 01:06:14.753
You do lunch late out here.

01:06:14.796 --> 01:06:15.797
This is dinner.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:19.627
It's 4:30.

01:06:19.671 --> 01:06:20.909
Well, we've been up since dawn.

01:06:20.933 --> 01:06:22.282
Why?

01:06:22.326 --> 01:06:24.241
How long have you two
worked together, Candy?

01:06:24.284 --> 01:06:25.372
Candace.

01:06:25.416 --> 01:06:27.940
Um, going on seven years.

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.551
In fact, I think
I'm the longest relationship

01:06:30.595 --> 01:06:31.552
Avery's ever had.

01:06:31.596 --> 01:06:32.989
Seven years...

01:06:33.032 --> 01:06:34.662
that's about when his movies
started going south.

01:06:34.686 --> 01:06:35.904
No offense, Avery.

01:06:35.948 --> 01:06:37.210
None taken.

01:06:37.254 --> 01:06:39.778
In fact, some would say
"south" is generous.

01:06:39.821 --> 01:06:41.823
Well, that is all
about to change

01:06:41.867 --> 01:06:44.565
with Aim To Please 6, 7 and 8.

01:06:44.609 --> 01:06:45.609
I look forward to that.

01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:49.210
Looks like we're going
to have to get Wi-Fi after all.

01:06:51.311 --> 01:06:52.399
Tell you what...

01:06:52.443 --> 01:06:53.966
I'm ready for some of that pie.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.054
You read my mind.

01:06:55.098 --> 01:06:56.708
- Yeah.
- There you go.

01:06:56.751 --> 01:06:57.709
Pie?

01:06:57.752 --> 01:06:58.710
I'll pass.

01:06:58.753 --> 01:06:59.753
You sure?

01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:02.279
It's better than yesterday!

01:07:02.322 --> 01:07:03.889
You had three pieces of that.

01:07:03.932 --> 01:07:06.892
Blueberry is the new black...
berry.

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.479
Hey, y'all.
How's everyone doing?

01:07:09.503 --> 01:07:11.288
Hey, Derek.

01:07:11.331 --> 01:07:12.289
Hey there.

01:07:12.332 --> 01:07:13.768
How are you?

01:07:13.812 --> 01:07:14.987
You ready,
Mr. Ford?

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:16.467
- Sure.
- Ready for what?

01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:19.165
I'm going to give an exclusive
to the Elkhorn Press.

01:07:19.209 --> 01:07:20.906
- What's that?
- My high school paper.

01:07:20.949 --> 01:07:23.126
Don't worry, he's
in good hands, ma'am.

01:07:23.169 --> 01:07:24.127
Derek, have a seat.

01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:25.650
Would you like some pie?

01:07:25.693 --> 01:07:27.478
Yeah.
Thanks, Heather.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:32.526
Is it okay
if I record this, Mr. Ford?

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:34.137
Sure. Probably the best way

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:35.573
to make sure
you don't misquote me.

01:07:35.616 --> 01:07:37.705
Great.

01:07:37.749 --> 01:07:38.880
Well, where should we start?

01:07:38.924 --> 01:07:40.317
First, I'd like

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.642
to clear up a few things
for my fans.

01:07:41.666 --> 01:07:42.797
Avery, I...

01:07:42.841 --> 01:07:44.451
don't think
that this is the place.

01:07:44.495 --> 01:07:46.279
No, this is the perfect place.

01:07:46.323 --> 01:07:48.151
See, the thing is...

01:07:48.194 --> 01:07:50.805
for years now,
I've been making my living

01:07:50.849 --> 01:07:52.938
pretending to be something

01:07:52.981 --> 01:07:54.853
that I didn't know
anything about.

01:07:54.896 --> 01:07:56.333
The fact is,

01:07:56.376 --> 01:07:59.771
until just about a week ago,

01:07:59.814 --> 01:08:01.555
I didn't know
what a real cowboy was.

01:08:17.876 --> 01:08:18.877
Your extra pillows.

01:08:22.228 --> 01:08:23.273
Thank you.

01:08:25.057 --> 01:08:27.145
Don't all these pillows
hurt your neck?

01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:29.192
No more than that bed will.

01:08:29.234 --> 01:08:30.821
I think you'll find
it's pretty comfortable.

01:08:30.845 --> 01:08:32.301
Well, I can put up
with anything for one night.

01:08:32.325 --> 01:08:33.412
Likewise.

01:08:42.421 --> 01:08:44.120
Can I give you
a piece of advice?

01:08:45.381 --> 01:08:46.339
Sure.

01:08:46.383 --> 01:08:48.211
Don't get too attached to him.

01:08:48.254 --> 01:08:49.821
He has a big life.

01:08:49.863 --> 01:08:52.084
He'll go on location,
he'll film a movie,

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:53.192
and he'll forget all about you.

01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:54.346
I don't believe that.

01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:56.001
I know who he is
in the real world.

01:08:57.263 --> 01:08:58.308
This is the real world.

01:08:58.350 --> 01:08:59.309
Not his.

01:08:59.352 --> 01:09:00.310
Maybe he's changed.

01:09:00.353 --> 01:09:01.702
Honey, he's an actor.

01:09:01.746 --> 01:09:04.051
He made people believe
he wore spurs and boots

01:09:04.095 --> 01:09:05.358
for 20 years.

01:09:05.402 --> 01:09:08.231
I'm certain he can make
a sweet girl like you

01:09:08.274 --> 01:09:09.710
believe he's falling in love.

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:14.212
I'm sorry, but it's better
that you hear it from me now,

01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:15.238
than him later.

01:09:17.718 --> 01:09:19.546
But I'll get him to send you

01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:21.591
a signed photograph from set.

01:09:25.509 --> 01:09:28.947
Stylist at 3:00,
Barnes and Noble at 5:00,

01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:30.557
cocktails at 7:00...

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.081
Just impossible.

01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:34.518
What?

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.475
In Amarillo, '71,

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.044
this bronc hadn't been covered
by anybody all year,

01:09:39.087 --> 01:09:41.002
then he meets Casey Twain.

01:09:41.046 --> 01:09:42.090
Have you been listening

01:09:42.134 --> 01:09:43.569
to anything I've been saying?

01:09:43.613 --> 01:09:44.745
I heard the word "barn."

01:09:44.788 --> 01:09:46.573
Barnes and Noble.

01:09:46.617 --> 01:09:49.446
Is this research,
or is this a mid-life crisis?

01:09:53.624 --> 01:09:54.799
I feel good here.

01:09:58.237 --> 01:10:00.587
I can't explain it, but...

01:10:00.631 --> 01:10:02.110
when I'm here,
I feel like I'm home.

01:10:02.154 --> 01:10:03.416
Home on the range?

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:04.939
Look, I get it.

01:10:04.983 --> 01:10:08.116
Annie Oakley here's
your new muse.

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.249
Whatever feelings
you think you're having,

01:10:10.293 --> 01:10:11.294
they'll evaporate.

01:10:11.337 --> 01:10:12.730
I mean, I should know.

01:10:12.773 --> 01:10:13.924
You used to have
feelings for me once.

01:10:13.948 --> 01:10:15.385
Yeah, this isn't that.

01:10:15.428 --> 01:10:16.603
'Cause you're on the ranch?

01:10:16.647 --> 01:10:17.754
Last time,
you were in the mountains.

01:10:17.778 --> 01:10:19.954
This is what you do, Avery.

01:10:19.998 --> 01:10:21.454
You meet somebody
when you're on location,

01:10:21.478 --> 01:10:23.436
and then you go home.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.438
Okay, this is not a "location."

01:10:26.439 --> 01:10:27.440
Heather!

01:10:27.484 --> 01:10:28.833
Hey! Wait!

01:10:31.836 --> 01:10:33.272
Look, that was her talking,
not me.

01:10:33.316 --> 01:10:34.621
So none of what she said
is true?

01:10:34.665 --> 01:10:36.536
Some of it is.

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:37.537
This isn't that.

01:10:37.581 --> 01:10:39.017
You've known me a week.

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:41.628
And sometimes, a week can be
more than seven days.

01:10:41.672 --> 01:10:43.804
And sometimes, it's just a week.

01:10:55.033 --> 01:10:56.295
It's beautiful.

01:10:59.472 --> 01:11:01.039
Honey...

01:11:01.082 --> 01:11:02.562
come here.

01:11:08.873 --> 01:11:10.701
We need to talk.

01:11:10.744 --> 01:11:11.745
About what?

01:11:14.313 --> 01:11:16.968
Your mother and I had
40 great years together.

01:11:17.011 --> 01:11:19.187
Those memories are enough
to carry me through.

01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:22.016
I don't need you giving up
your life to look after me.

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:23.409
I haven't given up anything.

01:11:23.453 --> 01:11:25.324
I know your first marriage
was a bust,

01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:27.259
but that doesn't mean
you don't get back on the horse.

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.328
Not the horse analogy
again, Dad.

01:11:29.372 --> 01:11:31.025
Remember when
you brought Buttercup home?

01:11:31.069 --> 01:11:32.853
You two hated
each other at first,

01:11:32.897 --> 01:11:34.701
but it wasn't long
before you were inseparable.

01:11:34.725 --> 01:11:36.814
Buttercup
didn't have complications.

01:11:36.857 --> 01:11:38.598
Candace isn't a complication.

01:11:38.642 --> 01:11:40.818
He's not looking at her,
he's looking at you.

01:11:40.861 --> 01:11:41.819
He's going home with her.

01:11:41.862 --> 01:11:43.864
Not if you ask him to stay.

01:11:43.908 --> 01:11:46.171
He's a city slicker, Dad,
not a cowboy.

01:11:46.214 --> 01:11:47.955
You sure about that?

01:12:18.551 --> 01:12:20.858
Heather?

01:12:20.901 --> 01:12:21.946
Is that you?

01:12:33.784 --> 01:12:35.612
Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:12:41.705 --> 01:12:43.794
Ha!

01:12:51.889 --> 01:12:53.586
- Hey!
- You stay out of this.

01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:54.630
Little late for that.

01:13:34.671 --> 01:13:37.195
Dad! The horses are gone!

01:13:37.238 --> 01:13:38.631
Guthrie.

01:13:38.675 --> 01:13:40.633
I never should've let him
set foot on this ranch.

01:13:56.823 --> 01:13:57.998
The gates.

01:14:08.705 --> 01:14:10.489
Got to open this one.

01:14:25.548 --> 01:14:26.853
Well, I'll be.

01:14:26.897 --> 01:14:28.657
If that ain't a cowboy,
I don't know what is.

01:14:42.565 --> 01:14:43.565
Whoa...

01:14:45.437 --> 01:14:48.048
Your first round-up.
Proud of you, son.

01:14:48.092 --> 01:14:49.223
Aw, it wasn't much.

01:14:49.267 --> 01:14:50.529
Horses like hazelnuts.

01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:57.251
I'm going to go
pay Guthrie a visit.

01:14:57.275 --> 01:14:58.450
Dad...

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.452
No, I've been sitting
on the fence too long.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:01.736
Time I kicked up a little dust.

01:15:05.936 --> 01:15:07.285
Thank you.

01:15:07.328 --> 01:15:09.679
I didn't mean for you
to get drawn into this.

01:15:09.722 --> 01:15:11.289
Nah...

01:15:11.332 --> 01:15:13.334
it's kind of nice to have
something to fight for.

01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:24.432
I guess you'd better
go get your stuff.

01:15:40.187 --> 01:15:41.798
It's time for me to go.

01:15:41.841 --> 01:15:44.496
You guys take care
of each other, okay?

01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:19.139
I want to thank you

01:16:19.183 --> 01:16:20.619
for everything you taught me.

01:16:20.663 --> 01:16:22.403
I learned
a little something myself.

01:16:22.447 --> 01:16:24.327
You know, you're welcome
in New York any time...

01:16:24.362 --> 01:16:25.450
Ain't gonna happen, son...

01:16:25.493 --> 01:16:27.626
but thanks for the offer.

01:16:32.544 --> 01:16:33.937
Avery!

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:34.938
We're going to miss the flight.

01:16:34.981 --> 01:16:36.156
Give me a minute.

01:16:41.118 --> 01:16:43.947
Look, I...

01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:45.557
I don't want it
to end like this.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:48.865
Well, I guess not all stories
have a happy ending.

01:16:48.908 --> 01:16:50.693
Well, mine do.

01:16:50.736 --> 01:16:52.782
And I look forward
to downloading them.

01:16:52.825 --> 01:16:54.784
So that's it?

01:16:54.827 --> 01:16:56.437
Going to leave it unsaid?

01:16:59.963 --> 01:17:01.791
We're from different worlds,
Avery.

01:17:03.401 --> 01:17:05.795
It's just best
that you go back to yours.

01:17:05.838 --> 01:17:07.187
Okay.

01:17:09.537 --> 01:17:11.844
If that's
what you really want...

01:17:16.762 --> 01:17:18.329
I aim to please.

01:18:03.766 --> 01:18:05.419
Hello?

01:18:08.248 --> 01:18:10.598
Yeah, I'll be there.

01:18:14.602 --> 01:18:17.693
Siri,
what's the weather outside?

01:18:20.217 --> 01:18:22.045
Hi, I'm Avery Ford.

01:18:22.088 --> 01:18:24.221
If you love the West
the way I do...

01:18:24.264 --> 01:18:26.092
Tilt the hat up.
We need to see your eyes.

01:18:28.268 --> 01:18:29.269
Bloodshot again.

01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:31.489
Great.

01:18:35.623 --> 01:18:37.800
Eye drops?
Anyone?

01:18:37.843 --> 01:18:38.844
Thanks.

01:18:43.936 --> 01:18:45.590
All right.

01:18:45.633 --> 01:18:47.723
I'm ready.
Let's go again.

01:18:51.465 --> 01:18:52.423
Hi.

01:18:52.466 --> 01:18:54.642
I'm Avery Ford.

01:18:54.686 --> 01:18:56.122
If you love the West
the way I do,

01:18:56.166 --> 01:18:58.211
you'll look forward
to the next two installments...

01:18:58.255 --> 01:18:59.865
- Three.
- What?

01:18:59.909 --> 01:19:01.016
It's three new installments.

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.607
God, I hate that word.

01:19:02.650 --> 01:19:05.479
Just... start over.

01:19:08.308 --> 01:19:10.267
I'm Avery Ford...

01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:12.748
and if you love the West
the way that I do...

01:19:15.228 --> 01:19:17.404
I do love the West.
This is not it.

01:19:17.448 --> 01:19:19.885
A hazelnut latte, okay,
for Avery, right away.

01:19:22.192 --> 01:19:23.323
No.

01:19:24.977 --> 01:19:26.283
No. I don't want hazelnut.

01:19:26.326 --> 01:19:28.807
I don't want Aim To Please 6.

01:19:28.851 --> 01:19:29.808
My heart is not in this anymore.

01:19:29.852 --> 01:19:31.418
Avery!

01:19:31.462 --> 01:19:35.945
This franchise is the reason
that you are you, all right?

01:19:36.989 --> 01:19:40.036
Without it, it's over.

01:19:40.079 --> 01:19:41.037
So...

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.821
start again.

01:19:44.867 --> 01:19:46.390
Start again.

01:19:59.533 --> 01:20:01.666
Hi. I'm Avery Ford.

01:20:01.709 --> 01:20:03.668
You love the West
the way that I do?

01:20:03.711 --> 01:20:06.149
You will not want to miss
the next three installments

01:20:06.192 --> 01:20:07.237
of Aim to Please.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:08.629
Bye, y'all!

01:20:08.673 --> 01:20:09.717
Thank you for everything!

01:20:09.761 --> 01:20:11.067
Thank you!
Thank you!

01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:12.938
Well,
that's the end of the season.

01:20:12.982 --> 01:20:14.244
It's been a good one.

01:20:14.287 --> 01:20:16.812
Still not good enough
to pay off our loan.

01:20:16.855 --> 01:20:19.205
That's life, honey.
Things move on.

01:20:19.249 --> 01:20:20.835
We're going to miss this place.

01:20:27.997 --> 01:20:29.433
What's he doing here?

01:20:29.476 --> 01:20:31.000
I thought I set him straight.

01:20:35.178 --> 01:20:37.267
You'd better drive off
while you still can.

01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:39.312
I just came to apologize, sir.

01:20:40.705 --> 01:20:41.662
Save it for the next person

01:20:41.706 --> 01:20:43.142
whose land you try to ruin.

01:20:43.186 --> 01:20:45.057
There won't be a next person.

01:20:45.101 --> 01:20:46.058
I quit.

01:20:46.102 --> 01:20:47.973
I went over to J Bar Ranch,

01:20:48.017 --> 01:20:51.150
and I saw the construction crew
clearing the land,

01:20:51.194 --> 01:20:53.239
and all I could see
were the old days,

01:20:53.283 --> 01:20:54.240
playing baseball
with you and the old gang

01:20:54.284 --> 01:20:55.633
in that field,

01:20:55.676 --> 01:20:57.436
that time that you got run off
by that steer.

01:20:57.461 --> 01:20:58.941
Suddenly, you're nostalgic?

01:20:58.984 --> 01:21:00.333
I became someone else, Heather,

01:21:00.377 --> 01:21:02.248
someone willing
to sell out his neighbors.

01:21:03.946 --> 01:21:06.644
I know I've worn out
my welcome here, and...

01:21:06.687 --> 01:21:09.125
I regret that.

01:21:09.168 --> 01:21:10.866
Just wanted you to know.

01:21:10.909 --> 01:21:12.519
Guthrie?

01:21:26.577 --> 01:21:28.013
Come on, kiddo.

01:21:44.203 --> 01:21:46.597
Charlie!
How you doing?

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:49.121
Yeah, looking good.

01:21:50.122 --> 01:21:51.254
Howdy, Fred.

01:21:51.297 --> 01:21:53.212
Howdy, Mr. Ford.

01:21:53.256 --> 01:21:54.605
Action!

01:22:05.529 --> 01:22:06.486
And cut!

01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:07.966
Genius job, Avery.

01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:09.576
Let's bring in
Danny the stuntman.

01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:10.577
I got this, Ira.

01:22:10.621 --> 01:22:11.752
You sure?

01:22:11.796 --> 01:22:13.058
You keep them cameras rolling.

01:22:13.102 --> 01:22:14.103
And action!

01:22:25.157 --> 01:22:26.724
- Go, Avery!
- Yeah, good job!

01:22:33.296 --> 01:22:35.124
- Did you see it?
- I did.

01:22:35.167 --> 01:22:36.299
And?

01:22:36.342 --> 01:22:37.300
You know I hate
the idea of being wrong,

01:22:37.343 --> 01:22:39.867
so this kills me to say, but...

01:22:41.434 --> 01:22:43.306
it's the best thing
you've ever done.

01:22:43.349 --> 01:22:45.699
It was real, Avery.
It was...

01:22:45.743 --> 01:22:46.962
Thanks.

01:22:47.005 --> 01:22:48.659
Yeah, I mean,
the studio's ecstatic.

01:22:48.702 --> 01:22:50.115
They're already talking
about 8, 9, and 10.

01:22:50.139 --> 01:22:51.488
Yeah, let's...

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.013
quit while we're ahead.
We had a good run.

01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:58.277
'Kay.

01:22:58.321 --> 01:22:59.887
Good luck.

01:22:59.931 --> 01:23:02.325
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

01:23:02.368 --> 01:23:04.240
Yeah.

01:23:04.283 --> 01:23:05.328
Me too.

01:23:10.028 --> 01:23:11.638
Tyler Mahoney!

01:23:13.162 --> 01:23:15.512
You know I'm half in love
with you, right?

01:23:15.555 --> 01:23:16.948
Hee hee! Yeah!

01:23:50.547 --> 01:23:52.462
Hey, Curly!
You lose a few?

01:23:56.335 --> 01:23:57.293
Avery...

01:23:57.336 --> 01:23:58.859
What are you doing here?

01:23:58.903 --> 01:24:00.122
I need a room.

01:24:00.165 --> 01:24:02.037
I'm afraid you're a little late.

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.429
We're closed up.

01:24:05.562 --> 01:24:06.867
He didn't tell you?

01:24:06.911 --> 01:24:08.367
Been waiting for you.
What took you so long?

01:24:08.391 --> 01:24:10.306
Well, I got lost
a couple of times.

01:24:10.349 --> 01:24:11.568
My phone went dead,

01:24:11.611 --> 01:24:13.004
and my truck has no navigation.

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:14.614
Wait, you guys
have been talking?

01:24:14.658 --> 01:24:16.007
Emailing, actually.

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:18.227
The ranch is ours, honey.
Free and clear.

01:24:19.271 --> 01:24:21.447
Some city-slicker
paid off our loan.

01:24:26.713 --> 01:24:28.367
We can't let you do that.

01:24:28.411 --> 01:24:30.152
One condition, though.

01:24:30.195 --> 01:24:31.718
I want my cabin back.

01:24:34.373 --> 01:24:35.418
I don't know what to say!

01:24:39.596 --> 01:24:41.163
Well, that'll do for starters.

01:24:41.206 --> 01:24:43.034
Tofu burgers.

01:24:43.078 --> 01:24:44.514
I'll throw 'em on the grill.

01:24:44.557 --> 01:24:45.515
You in?

01:24:45.558 --> 01:24:46.603
All in.

01:24:54.132 --> 01:24:56.352
An old cowboy once told me...

01:24:56.395 --> 01:24:58.789
don't say anything
you don't mean.

01:24:58.832 --> 01:25:01.096
You and me
are from two different worlds.

01:25:01.139 --> 01:25:02.314
I know that.

01:25:04.142 --> 01:25:05.970
But I could love you...

01:25:06.013 --> 01:25:07.363
if you let me.

01:25:12.063 --> 01:25:14.109
How long you plan on staying?

01:25:14.152 --> 01:25:16.589
Let's see where this trail goes.
