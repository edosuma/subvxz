WEBVTT

00:08.967 --> 00:10.885
So, three years this March?

00:10.969 --> 00:13.972
Sorry, I've been meaning to come in.
I've been--

00:14.055 --> 00:15.849
Busy. No, I get it.

00:15.932 --> 00:20.020
But like Ferris B. said on his day off,
"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't--"

00:20.103 --> 00:24.357
Netflix. I've been doing Netflix,
you know, like, well, everybody.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.944
-Zing.
-Their algorithm keeps recommending

00:28.028 --> 00:30.321
<i>The Great British Bake Off,</i>
which is trigger for me

00:30.405 --> 00:33.158
since Amanda left me for a chef
from Manchester

00:33.241 --> 00:34.451
she met on Facebook.

00:34.534 --> 00:38.663
Yikes. Sorry, that sentence
just kept getting worse.

00:38.747 --> 00:42.459
I bet that guy makes a good living.
Croissants are so expensive

00:42.542 --> 00:45.462
and you have to be Scrooge McDuck
to afford the chocolate one.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.964
-Way to focus on what's important.
-What is important?

00:48.048 --> 00:50.258
Not washing your hair every day.

00:50.341 --> 00:54.095
Anyway, as always, I have
the perfect movie to cheer you up.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.222
So many great breakup films.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.391
<i>Eternal Sunshine, High Fidelity,</i>

00:58.475 --> 01:00.852
and if you're feeling freaky,<i> Midsommar.</i>

01:00.935 --> 01:03.313
I have a good one. Oh, what's it called?

01:03.396 --> 01:07.442
It's with the lady from
the smartwater ads and Van Jones.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.152
-From CNN?
-You don't speak Connie.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.279
She means Jennifer Aniston
and Vince Vaughn.

01:11.362 --> 01:14.032
<i>-TheBreak-Up.</i>
-No spoilers. Haven't seen it.

01:14.115 --> 01:17.660
All good suggestions, gang,
but I got this.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.913
<i>Under the Tuscan Sun?</i>

01:19.996 --> 01:20.872
Are you sure?

01:20.955 --> 01:22.999
Doesn't really seem me.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.960
I've been working here
since seventh grade.

01:26.044 --> 01:29.422
-That is not the flex you think it is.
-Anyway, trust me,

01:29.506 --> 01:32.967
you need to get out of your lane
and into Diane Lane.

01:33.635 --> 01:37.764
-Okay. Thanks. I'll bring it back soon.
-I'm not going anywhere.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.016
-Don from Corporate.
-Ooh.

01:40.892 --> 01:44.562
-Donny. What's going, Don?
-<i>Every time. Look,</i>

01:44.646 --> 01:47.774
no easy way to say this.
Seven more Blockbusters closed.

01:47.857 --> 01:49.859
<i>You're the last one on Earth.</i>

01:49.943 --> 01:54.280
Uh, I don't love the pattern
that's starting to emerge.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.241
<i>I'm sure you are gonna be fine.</i>

01:56.324 --> 02:00.203
Yeah. Maybe you're right.
Change can be scary, but oftentimes--

02:00.286 --> 02:02.122
-Nice knowing you, Timmy.
<i>-What?</i>

02:02.831 --> 02:05.792
-You said we'll be fine.
<i>-And you probably will be.</i>

02:05.875 --> 02:09.587
I, on the other hand, am screwed.
They're liquidating Corporate.

02:09.671 --> 02:12.674
This place is gonna be
a WeWork by tomorrow morning.

02:12.757 --> 02:14.134
Well, don't worry, Don.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.761
-I'm sure you'll also be fine. Hello?

02:27.438 --> 02:28.273
You okay?

02:29.607 --> 02:33.403
No. How do we replace
an entire corporate infrastructure?

02:33.486 --> 02:34.946
Purchasing, rental tracking.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.489
They paid half our rent.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.740
My God. They did?

02:38.741 --> 02:42.287
-I mean, we'll figure it out.
-That's what I said to Mindy

02:42.370 --> 02:44.873
from Mindy's Travel Hut
before she went out of business.

02:44.956 --> 02:48.459
-My point is the Internet sucks.
-I would love to disagree,

02:48.543 --> 02:51.045
but also Logan Paul, TikTok influencers,

02:51.129 --> 02:52.463
those BuzzFeed quizzes

02:52.547 --> 02:54.674
that tell you
which <i>Bridgerton</i> servant you are.

02:54.757 --> 02:57.135
-I make Lady Danbury's tea.
-Ooh.

02:57.218 --> 02:58.928
My whole life is this store.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.430
I love Blockbuster.

03:00.513 --> 03:04.267
I should've seen this coming,
but I guess I just didn't want to.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.560
But look around.

03:05.643 --> 03:08.021
DJ Steve's Hip-Hop Flip-Flop Shop, gone.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.815
It was the most popular
pill mill in Michigan.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.192
Now it's a ghost kitchen.

03:12.275 --> 03:16.279
You could make a good riddance
argument for those places, but I hear you.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.573
I don't miss places, I miss people.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.909
Humans need to interact with each other.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.161
Mindy made me laugh every morning.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.246
DJ Steve gave the best advice.

03:25.330 --> 03:28.041
So long as you steered clear
of his opinions on pronouns.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.086
Maybe I'm just old-fashioned.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.005
Of course you are.

03:34.672 --> 03:38.551
-Timmy, you're a dinosaur.
-And you're not good at pep talks.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.137
But you're the last dinosaur.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.599
Like my professor at Harvard
used to teach us.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.768
Turn your bug into a feature.

03:46.851 --> 03:49.229
Used to teach you during one semester?

03:49.312 --> 03:52.273
-It was a semester and a half.
-Seamless Harvard drop as always.

03:52.357 --> 03:57.570
The point is, it might not be a bad thing
that you're the last Blockbuster.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.405
It might be a good thing.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.575
-Listening.
-I bet it's about his parents.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.328
He's been struggling
since they got divorced.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.329
In middle school.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.999
Maybe he got in that fight with his
roommates again about beer before liquor.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.586
Or he's bummed because
he's a grown man with roommates.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.715
Duh, he's just freaking out
because we're the last Blockbuster.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.425
-What?
-Look.

04:20.510 --> 04:24.764
-What are we gonna do?
-We are gonna throw a block party.

04:24.847 --> 04:25.932
A block party?

04:26.015 --> 04:27.642
That's your idea?

04:27.725 --> 04:30.645
No, I like it.
I just thought it would be better.

04:30.728 --> 04:34.315
I'm sorry, I meant smarter.
Thought it'd be good. Keep going.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.360
Look, a friendly neighborhood block party

04:37.443 --> 04:40.863
is the perfect cheap way
to drum up new memberships

04:40.947 --> 04:43.491
while reminding everyone
that small businesses

04:43.574 --> 04:47.287
offer something the Internet can't,
human connection.

04:47.370 --> 04:50.331
Like you said.
Like you did with that guy, Jeff.

04:50.415 --> 04:53.418
-I did say and do that.
-Come on, we can do this.

04:53.501 --> 04:56.462
Wow, I have not seen you
this stoked about anything

04:56.546 --> 05:00.425
-since you started working here again.
-Well, sorry, if I haven't seemed stoked

05:00.508 --> 05:03.886
to be working the job I had
for one summer in high school.

05:03.970 --> 05:08.182
Remember when that goth kid
got his hand stuck in the return slot?

05:10.476 --> 05:11.853
Oh, yeah.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.440
Back then I chose to be here

05:15.523 --> 05:18.693
as opposed to being forced to
take a job I am way overqualified for

05:18.776 --> 05:21.237
just so I can afford
the studio apartment I had to rent

05:21.321 --> 05:22.822
because I caught my husband Aaron

05:22.905 --> 05:25.658
on a date with a 25-year-old
also named Erin

05:25.742 --> 05:27.910
at the restaurant in Costco.

05:27.994 --> 05:31.372
The girl your Aaron slept with
was also named Erin?

05:31.998 --> 05:34.292
-Why is that worse?
-I don't know, but it is.

05:35.209 --> 05:38.963
Okay, a block party.
I like it. This is gonna be so...

05:39.047 --> 05:40.590
Stupid. A block party?

05:40.673 --> 05:43.718
Start looking for jobs now.
As if there are any.

05:43.801 --> 05:46.346
This town
is not the land of milk and honey,

05:46.429 --> 05:49.015
especially since they shut down
the dairy and the apiary.

05:49.098 --> 05:51.934
I'll light a prayer candle
the second I get home.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.812
I'll wish upon a star.
How am I supposed to be next Tarantino

05:54.896 --> 05:56.397
if I don't work in a video store?

05:56.481 --> 05:58.816
Uh-huh.
Yeah, that's what's holding you back.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.070
This is the only job
where my boss didn't yell at me

06:02.153 --> 06:04.364
or ask if I can do the splits.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.241
-I have to go back to selling leggings.
-I can see my friends.

06:07.325 --> 06:10.203
-I love you more than my real kids.
-I can do the splits, but--

06:10.286 --> 06:15.375
Guys. No one's going anywhere
or doing the splits.

06:16.459 --> 06:20.129
I know things seem bad,
but someone very smart once said:

06:20.213 --> 06:23.091
"Your greatest weakness
can be your greatest strength."

06:23.174 --> 06:24.133
It was me.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.343
Be less thirsty.

06:25.426 --> 06:29.013
Maybe our greatest strength is
we force people to get off their asses

06:29.097 --> 06:30.598
and hang out with humans.

06:30.681 --> 06:33.393
That's more important
now than ever because...

06:38.815 --> 06:41.651
-God, careful.
-Uh, what's happening?

06:42.610 --> 06:45.405
We can't be consumed
by our differences anymore.

06:45.488 --> 06:49.158
We will be united
in our common interests.

06:49.242 --> 06:53.496
Perhaps it's fate that today
is the 19th of September.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.457
We will once again fight for freedom.

06:56.541 --> 07:01.796
Not from tyranny, oppression
or persecution, but from annihilation.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.174
-Is that from <i>Independence Day?</i>
-Yes.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.511
Today we celebrate our Independence Day

07:08.594 --> 07:11.264
from all the corporations
ruining this country

07:11.347 --> 07:14.100
by throwing the greatest block party
ever seen

07:14.183 --> 07:16.561
and signing up more members
than that sex cult

07:16.644 --> 07:20.398
with the creepy volleyball guy
and Chloe from <i>Smallville.</i>

07:20.481 --> 07:21.399
Yeah!

07:21.482 --> 07:23.192
Blockbuster on three.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.571
One, two...

07:27.488 --> 07:30.324
Isn't it ironic
the small business taking a stand

07:30.408 --> 07:32.785
against the big corporation
in this scenario

07:32.869 --> 07:35.496
is a franchise of a once huge corporation

07:35.580 --> 07:37.790
named after the type
of big corporate movies

07:37.874 --> 07:39.584
that killed smaller movies?

07:42.086 --> 07:42.962
Really, dude?

07:44.630 --> 07:45.590
Sorry.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.052
Okay, so for this to work

07:50.136 --> 07:53.389
it's gotta feel like
we just invited our neighbors over

07:53.473 --> 07:55.475
for a casual neighborhood barbecue

07:55.558 --> 07:57.643
because we're not just
small business owners,

07:57.727 --> 07:58.936
were also neighbors.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.648
"Don't say "neighbor" so many times.
You sound like Mr. Rogers.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.066
And action.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.195
<i>So we have Carlos and Hannah</i>
<i>doing online marketing.</i>

08:09.322 --> 08:11.699
<i>Connie's working with stoners on snacks.</i>

08:12.867 --> 08:15.536
<i>Kayla's putting up</i>
<i>signs she made around town.</i>

08:17.622 --> 08:20.416
<i>We'll talk to Patrice</i>
<i>about a mani-pedi station</i>

08:20.500 --> 08:23.252
<i>-and Carol about a shooting gallery.</i>
-Consider me enlisted.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.670
Okay.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.631
<i>Rene has a petting zoo hookup.</i>

08:27.798 --> 08:30.468
<i>-Mitch will serve drinks.</i>
-<i>He'll serve anyone.</i>

08:30.551 --> 08:32.553
<i>And you'll give one of your speeches.</i>

08:32.637 --> 08:34.972
-<i>Don't mind if I do.</i>
-<i>That just leaves Percy.</i>

08:35.056 --> 08:36.974
<i>We need Party! Parti! Parté! for supplies,</i>

08:37.058 --> 08:39.018
<i>but need Percy</i>
<i>to let us use the strip mall.</i>

08:39.101 --> 08:41.812
<i>We got this.</i>
<i>Percy and I are best buds.</i>

08:41.896 --> 08:43.523
Hard pass.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.108
This sounds like a four alarm snooze fest.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.487
Wouldn't those alarms
make it hard to sleep?

08:50.029 --> 08:52.782
Look, as a party industry professional,

08:52.865 --> 08:56.452
I can't be associated
with some lame-ass potluck. Okay?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.454
My strip mall, my rules.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.873
Percy, man, come on.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.250
Unless...

09:03.417 --> 09:06.754
-Unless I can goose it up a notch.
-You're mixing idioms.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.839
-You calling me an idiom?
-That'd be idiotic.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.634
If I were refereeing a game
of National Parks Monopoly,

09:11.717 --> 09:13.177
you two would be my parents now.

09:14.303 --> 09:17.557
Maybe we can not let our
personal feelings cloud our judgment.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.058
-Thank you, Tim.
-Yeah.

09:19.141 --> 09:22.478
Yeah. First thing you're gonna need
is a foam machine.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.565
There's nothing sexier than
turning the ground into a bubble bath.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.607
Yeah.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.735
People go crazy over it.
All that foam's everywhere.

09:29.819 --> 09:33.197
Start making bubble angels
and they love it. They love it.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.367
Yeah. Sexy is not really a vibe
that we're going for.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.869
-We need a DJ.
-No, no, no. DJs plural.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.455
-What?
-Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

09:41.539 --> 09:44.000
DJ battle!

09:47.003 --> 09:51.173
You gotta have a big-ass inflatable
car dealership-type gorilla, son.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.174
Obviously, son.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.467
Why though, son?

09:53.551 --> 09:57.388
To draw people in. See, that is why
you got kicked out of Harvard.

09:57.471 --> 09:59.390
-That's not what happened.
-Allegedly.

09:59.473 --> 10:01.726
Luckily, I got you on the gorilla,

10:01.809 --> 10:04.895
and get you half off
on the foam machine and DJ booth

10:04.979 --> 10:07.315
'cause you're my boy. I got you.

10:07.398 --> 10:11.652
-Thank you. This is gonna be so epic.
-Okay, you're perverting my idea.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.447
Is she calling me a pervert?
Check your girl.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.824
No, no. Look, look, it's a collab, E.

10:16.907 --> 10:19.869
It's like Yeezys
or the Dorito shell at Taco Bell.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.454
-Love that taco shell.
-It's good.

10:21.537 --> 10:24.582
We only have one shot to attract
as many new customers as possible.

10:24.665 --> 10:27.293
I'm maxing out my cards here.
We have to make it count.

10:27.376 --> 10:30.671
Not to brag, but me and Percy
used to be kind of famous

10:30.755 --> 10:33.424
for ragers we'd throw
at my parents' house.

10:33.507 --> 10:36.427
Yeah. I remember.
My school wasn't allowed

10:36.510 --> 10:39.305
to have a graduation party
because two idiots

10:39.388 --> 10:41.265
drove a Zamboni through a living room.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.476
The only ZUI in history of Michigan.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.644
Better Google it.

10:44.727 --> 10:49.565
Okay, guys, respectfully-ish,
that was high school. Okay?

10:49.649 --> 10:52.360
I know what I'm talking about.
I majored in marketing.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.986
For five minutes. I'm just saying.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.364
At least I graduated high school
in under a decade.

10:56.447 --> 10:59.825
I repeated middle school.
Middle school. You were there.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.161
I don't know about you,
but I'm not using algebra.

11:02.244 --> 11:05.373
Stop. Percy is just upset
because he wants to help.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.624
Eliza is just upset

11:06.707 --> 11:08.709
because of the husband cheating
on her thing.

11:08.793 --> 11:09.877
-But if we foc--
-Timmy!

11:10.544 --> 11:12.421
-Ooh.
-That was private.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.635
You know what? Good luck.

11:18.344 --> 11:22.223
Good luck with your dumbass gorilla,
DJ battle,

11:22.306 --> 11:24.558
awesome, not awesome party.

11:24.642 --> 11:28.020
-You forgot the foam machine!
-It's a health hazard!

11:29.355 --> 11:31.691
-I'm gonna...
-Yeah, you go handle that.

11:31.774 --> 11:36.112
Don't leave the foam out like that.
Sexiest part of the party is the foam.

11:36.737 --> 11:37.571
Eliza.

11:38.114 --> 11:42.326
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that.
Percy only had a few tweaks.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.370
I need him on board
to use the parking lot.

11:44.453 --> 11:46.664
No, what you need is to grow up.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.332
What? I'm hella grown up.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.458
Really?

11:49.542 --> 11:53.045
You still share a brain
with the dude you did whippets with.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.797
You've never been in a relationship

11:54.880 --> 11:57.007
longer than it takes
to microwave a Hot Pocket.

11:57.091 --> 12:00.720
-And you just used the word "hella."
-I own my own business.

12:00.803 --> 12:04.348
-You still have roommates!
-Roommate. Garrett is missing.

12:04.432 --> 12:08.436
Life isn't <i>21 Jump Street,</i> Timmy.
You can't go back to high school.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.605
What was so great
about your life back then anyway?

12:11.689 --> 12:14.191
Me and Percy
were the kings of the school.

12:14.275 --> 12:17.570
Principal Amos would let me
rap morning announcements.

12:17.653 --> 12:20.239
I didn't have a trauma patch
of white hair

12:20.322 --> 12:22.116
from my parents' divorce yet.

12:23.659 --> 12:26.036
Wow, divorce really messes kids up, huh?

12:26.120 --> 12:28.622
No, I'm fine.
You're the one with the messed-up life.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.542
I can't believe you told Percy
about me and Aaron.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.754
Let it go. Everyone knows
your husband cheated on you.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.256
-He did?
-I didn't know about that.

12:37.339 --> 12:40.384
-I expected that's why you split up.
-Someone married you?

12:43.137 --> 12:46.348
-Have fun at your stupid party.
-Eliza.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.895
So is the block party still on?

12:50.978 --> 12:52.813
Need to know if I need to shave my legs.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.025
It's still on
and it's gonna be the party of the year.

12:59.653 --> 13:00.488
Chicks, right?

13:00.571 --> 13:03.699
Um, gender is a spectrum.
But way to say the sexist part loud.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.367
-Sexist?
-He's right, 'Los.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.746
Look, I'm only 24,
so I shouldn't be giving you advice.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.791
You ever think the reason
why she makes you so mad

13:11.874 --> 13:14.043
is because you have a thing for her?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.045
What?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.011
You know what?

13:24.094 --> 13:26.138
He is absolutely right.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.599
Now I remember. Yes!

13:28.682 --> 13:33.312
You crushed hard on her that summer
she worked with you freshman year.

13:33.395 --> 13:37.316
No. Look, I may have had
some feelings for Eliza then,

13:37.399 --> 13:38.943
but that was 20 years ago.

13:39.026 --> 13:41.529
What makes you think
there's anything still there?

13:42.696 --> 13:45.324
Are you picking up a vibe
or something, 'Los?

13:45.407 --> 13:48.285
-Like, from her too or...?
-Um, maybe.

13:48.369 --> 13:51.455
Look, take it from me.
Do not deuce where you chow.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.791
And don't smash anybody you work with.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.376
It's bad. Been there, done that.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.003
No, I'm not just
talking about smashing her.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.423
Uh, if I was still talking
about anything at all, which I'm not.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.843
-The end.
-Look, if you want my advice,

14:03.926 --> 14:06.887
which, again, seems weird
because you've got 15 years on me,

14:06.971 --> 14:08.764
tell her how you feel before it's late.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.308
I wish I tweeted
at Walter Mercado before he died.

14:11.392 --> 14:12.893
Ehh! You had time.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.187
That man's been old your entire life.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.273
Like Colonel Sanders and Elmer Fudd.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.066
Tell her at the block party.

14:19.149 --> 14:22.570
-That'd be so cinematic.
-Are you gonna take chick advice

14:22.653 --> 14:25.614
from someone
who says things are cinematic?

14:25.698 --> 14:30.327
You gotta drink her out of your head.
Trust me, I know women. Hey, Mitch.

14:30.411 --> 14:34.248
Next round on me. Guess who sold
their first copy of their e-book,

14:34.331 --> 14:36.417
<i>How to Be a Player After Divorce.</i>

14:36.500 --> 14:38.711
-Hmm.

14:38.794 --> 14:41.505
-Hey, bottom shelf.
-I'm the one who bought it.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.929
<i>♪ No secret, no sneakin'</i>

15:00.232 --> 15:04.111
I guess I just imagined our last day
to be less soapy.

15:04.194 --> 15:07.615
You no longer have an excuse
to not move to Hollywood.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.700
No, I'm still finding my voice.

15:09.783 --> 15:13.621
The TikTok you made today
was better than five of the <i>Star Wars.</i>

15:13.704 --> 15:16.081
I haven't actually seen any of them.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.791
I'm just on Reddit a lot.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.668
So, what's your dream job?

15:19.752 --> 15:23.005
I'd love to work with animals,
but it's tough with the language barrier.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.424
Or a seamstress,
but only for American Girl dolls.

15:25.507 --> 15:28.385
This is why I have to stay.
I'm gonna reverse <i>Blind Side</i> you.

15:28.469 --> 15:30.471
Tell me that's not
an Urban Dictionary thing.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.222
Probably is, but I mean the movie.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.058
I'll be the person of color

15:34.141 --> 15:37.436
that teaches a pretty white woman
she could have more out of life.

15:37.519 --> 15:40.397
I can't start over with new work friends
at Hobby Lobby.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.776
Hey, guys. Heard from Eliza?
You know if she's coming?

15:43.859 --> 15:47.237
-Oh, God. You're really gonna do it.
-Do what?

15:47.321 --> 15:49.782
DJ battle!

15:52.993 --> 15:55.371
'Los, can you get them to turn it down?

15:55.454 --> 15:56.330
I'll try.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.833
We still got it, bro!

15:59.917 --> 16:01.543
Never doubted us, Perce.

16:02.044 --> 16:05.297
But, hey, it's a little loud.
Also, does it seem like

16:05.381 --> 16:09.760
our "support local small businesses"
message is getting slightly obscured?

16:09.843 --> 16:11.220
Why would you say that?

16:13.722 --> 16:16.058
That was the whole point of this thing.

16:16.141 --> 16:19.395
Speaking of, I wanna
give a little speech from the heart

16:19.478 --> 16:20.896
about community and stuff.

16:20.980 --> 16:21.814
Right.

16:21.897 --> 16:24.316
It's not a rager until there's a message.

16:25.567 --> 16:28.237
No offense, but you're not
about that public-speaking life.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.531
I'm giving a speech from the heart.

16:30.614 --> 16:34.451
Look, I need this to work
or I lose everything.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.620
It's not just about me.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.207
I'm the only one looking out
for the people who work here now.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.543
Okay. I get it. I get it.

16:42.626 --> 16:43.877
It's gonna be fine.

16:43.961 --> 16:46.630
I got one more surprise,
and then you're on.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.090
Whoo!

16:48.757 --> 16:50.718
You didn't catch it. Let's go.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.929
Ladies and gentlemen.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.099
Turn your attention to the sky

16:57.182 --> 17:01.854
for a dazzling salute to the troops!

17:07.901 --> 17:09.194
Whoo!

17:10.154 --> 17:11.155
It's daytime.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.245
Percy!

17:34.720 --> 17:36.221
Hey, hey, don't go. Stay.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.891
Stay. Hey. No, no, no. Stay, stay, stay.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.559
Where are you going?

17:40.642 --> 17:42.853
You can't leave without a membership.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.415
Looks like I missed an epic bash.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.211
Eliza, did you come to congratulate me

18:07.294 --> 18:09.379
on flushing our store down the pooper?

18:09.463 --> 18:11.757
You think "pooper" means "toilet"?

18:12.716 --> 18:14.468
I'm here 'cause I'm on the schedule.

18:16.053 --> 18:16.887
I'm kidding.

18:16.970 --> 18:19.765
I figured you could use a hand
because I've never seen a party

18:19.848 --> 18:23.310
with a foam machine
that didn't end in total disaster.

18:23.393 --> 18:24.228
Thanks.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.357
So listen.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.733
-Eliza?
-Yeah?

18:29.817 --> 18:34.279
There's something I've been wanting
to talk to you for a really long time.

18:35.531 --> 18:39.827
-Excuse me. Sir, I'm--
-Channel 12's Remington Alexander?

18:39.910 --> 18:42.204
Guilty as charged. Do you work here?

18:42.287 --> 18:45.165
I'd love to ask you
about the gorilla attack.

18:45.249 --> 18:49.128
I actually own the place.
I'm sorry, did you say "gorilla attack"?

18:49.211 --> 18:50.546
Haven't you seen this?

18:51.088 --> 18:51.964
Oh.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.925
We're outside the last Blockbuster,

18:55.008 --> 18:56.385
where less than an hour ago

18:56.468 --> 18:59.429
the viral gorilla attack video was filmed.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.140
What exactly happened here?

19:01.223 --> 19:05.978
Uh, well, a bottle rocket
hit our giant inflatable gorilla,

19:06.061 --> 19:07.688
which wasn't very ideal,

19:07.771 --> 19:10.774
but my man, Carlos,
over there did the rest.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.734
-You should interview him.
-Uh, no, thank you.

19:12.818 --> 19:16.446
Okay. Well, is there anything else
you can tell us?

19:17.030 --> 19:17.906
Uh...

19:17.990 --> 19:19.616
Um, uh...

19:19.700 --> 19:23.036
But what happened before all that
is a much bigger story.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.165
-What?
-Remington, we, as a society,

19:26.248 --> 19:27.958
have lost something huge.

19:28.041 --> 19:29.001
Each other.

19:29.084 --> 19:33.338
Shopping, buying party supplies,
and, yes, even renting a movie

19:33.422 --> 19:36.216
used to be our chance
to interact with a familiar face.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.678
But big corporations
like Amazon stole that.

19:39.761 --> 19:42.139
It's why people are pissed off nowadays.

19:42.222 --> 19:45.184
Because you can't replace
getting to know a person

19:45.267 --> 19:47.102
with a computer program

19:47.186 --> 19:50.856
or the smile of a stranger
with a smiling box.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.609
This party was our way
of reminding people.

19:53.692 --> 19:57.279
So if you agree, come sign up
for a Blockbuster membership

19:57.362 --> 19:59.031
at the Grand Mill Shopping Center,

19:59.114 --> 20:01.700
and together,
our community can do something

20:01.783 --> 20:05.996
that no other community has done,
keep Blockbuster Video alive.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.539
Yeah.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.292
-Yeah.
-Yeah, baby. Yeah.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.501
Yeah.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.504
Holy eggplant involtini, bro.
You were so right.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.299
This movie made me feel
so much better about getting dumped.

20:17.382 --> 20:20.260
It gave me hope when I least expected it.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.638
Just like Tuscany did for Frances.

20:23.555 --> 20:27.684
Oh, are we on TV?
Listen, this dude is a genius.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.771
Algorithms can suck it.
Long live Blockbuster.

20:30.854 --> 20:31.688
Okay.

20:31.772 --> 20:36.985
How about you give our viewers a tour
of the last Blockbuster on the planet?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.655
My pleasure. Come on, this way.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.366
-Holy smokes.
-Wow, Carlos!

20:42.449 --> 20:45.953
Does this mean
you're like a famous director now?

20:46.036 --> 20:50.540
I saw that guy interview a sock puppet
about the Final Four, so I don't know.

20:50.624 --> 20:53.377
I'm happy the video
got the store publicity.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.336
How did it get out?

20:54.419 --> 20:55.337
I don't know.

20:56.588 --> 20:59.299
Oh, well, well, well.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.176
Kayla posted it.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.845
Maybe someone cares after all.

21:03.929 --> 21:04.930
Calm down, dorks.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.807
I did it to embarrass Timmy and my dad.

21:07.474 --> 21:11.186
Oh. Did everybody hear that?
My daughter called me "Dad"

21:11.270 --> 21:13.146
without the word "cuck."

21:13.230 --> 21:15.357
Whoo! This is the best day ever!

21:15.440 --> 21:18.068
-Come here. Yes. No cuck.
-Okay.

21:18.151 --> 21:18.986
No cuck!

21:31.915 --> 21:35.043
Wow. I guess congrats are in order.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.797
Somehow, against all odds
and the god I thought I knew,

21:38.880 --> 21:42.759
you and Percy were able to get
our message out to a ton of people.

21:42.843 --> 21:46.346
Phone's been ringing off the hook.
87 new memberships.

21:46.430 --> 21:47.973
I'm still in shock.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.143
But it was your idea, so thank you.

21:51.226 --> 21:54.187
Hopefully, it's enough
to let us fight another day.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.105
I hope so.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.567
Don't tell my boss,
but I kind of like it here.

21:58.650 --> 22:02.529
Don't tell my you, but if this store
has any chance at surviving,

22:02.612 --> 22:04.614
we'll need your big Harvard brain.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.241
I went to Harvard.

22:08.368 --> 22:12.289
I really am sorry
about what I said yesterday, though.

22:12.372 --> 22:16.501
I was stressed, and divorce
is a real trigger for me as it is for you.

22:16.585 --> 22:17.919
And, um...

22:19.421 --> 22:22.716
I thought about everything you said,
and you were right.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.634
I gotta stop living in the past.

22:24.718 --> 22:28.347
Just because my parents' relationship
didn't work doesn't mean mine won't.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.264
That's stupid.

22:31.058 --> 22:34.686
Eliza, you inspired me
to grow up, for real,

22:35.645 --> 22:38.148
-which is why--
-Well, don't go crazy.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.692
Being such a kid is what I love--

22:41.276 --> 22:44.112
I mean, what people love about you.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.032
That's called
turning your bug into a feature.

22:47.115 --> 22:48.200
Ha, ha.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.369
And it's not stupid.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.662
Divorce is traumatizing.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.541
You made me see things in a new light too.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.210
There you are.

22:59.169 --> 23:01.338
-Hey.
-Your Camaro awaits, my dear.

23:01.421 --> 23:02.881
I will be right there.

23:02.964 --> 23:05.092
Hey, Tim. Saw you on the news.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.136
Sold Remington Alexander a condo.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.304
Cool, man.

23:10.347 --> 23:12.641
-I'll wait in the car, goose.
-Okay.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.309
Three-bedroom condo.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.816
When we first met, I had this honk laugh,

23:20.899 --> 23:23.110
so now we call each other "goose."

23:24.152 --> 23:26.488
Anyway, we're having a drink tonight.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.701
You made me look at things
from my daughter's perspective.

23:31.785 --> 23:36.039
I moved out after Ali went to college,
so I thought she'd be okay, but...

23:37.040 --> 23:38.125
she's struggling.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.795
And I'm worried she feels like

23:41.878 --> 23:43.755
she doesn't have a place to come home to,

23:43.839 --> 23:47.717
so I'm giving Aaron another chance.

23:48.885 --> 23:49.719
For her.

23:53.515 --> 23:54.975
Uh, no, totally.

23:55.976 --> 23:56.852
Of course.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.354
I hope it works out.

24:00.730 --> 24:01.565
Thanks.

24:02.983 --> 24:03.817
Night.
