A very, very long time ago,

01:40.726 --> 01:44.271
long before
the birds, cars,

01:44.438 --> 01:46.106
and even coffee beans,

01:46.273 --> 01:48.400
the seven gods
of the seven lands

01:48.567 --> 01:50.903
created
the dueling truths--

01:51.069 --> 01:52.946
love and war.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.410
The gods then decided
humans would need a place

01:58.577 --> 02:00.829
away from these elements.

02:00.996 --> 02:03.540
A small island.

02:03.707 --> 02:07.753
This island,
in the very center
of the world.

02:08.712 --> 02:11.256
They called it Guava.

02:14.635 --> 02:18.180
And this place, so filled
with magic of the gods

02:18.347 --> 02:20.641
and untouched
by man’s hand,

02:20.807 --> 02:25.395
blossomed and bore fruit
unlike any other place
on Earth.

02:30.234 --> 02:32.903
But the most amazing
of all its bounty...

02:34.279 --> 02:36.281
was the clayworm,

02:36.448 --> 02:38.867
a creature only found
on Guava Island

02:39.034 --> 02:43.539
that spins the most
beautiful blue silk
man had ever seen.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.916
Every man who saw the silk

02:46.083 --> 02:47.376
fell in love with it.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.128

[branch snaps]

02:59.263 --> 03:01.932
The Red family
took control of the silk,

03:02.099 --> 03:03.308
along with
the people of Guava.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.185
[sewing machines whirring]

03:05.352 --> 03:08.564
Greed and distrust spread
all across the island.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.734
The gods,
fed up with our insolence,

03:12.901 --> 03:15.070
turned their backs
on the humans

03:15.237 --> 03:17.364
and paradise was lost.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.497
My mother
told me this story
every night before bed,

03:25.664 --> 03:27.666
like her mother
before her.

03:29.376 --> 03:32.087
To me, it was just
a bedtime story.

03:32.254 --> 03:36.633
As far as I could tell,
there was nothing for me
on Guava.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.677
I longed
to leave the island...

03:39.720 --> 03:41.889
to see the world outside.

[guitar strumming]

03:51.523 --> 03:53.108
I heard my path.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.110
[strumming continues]

03:55.277 --> 03:58.989
It was
the most beautiful song
I’d ever heard.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.242
But I was not
going to say that.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.369
So, instead, I yelled--

04:04.536 --> 04:05.829
Keep trying!

04:06.914 --> 04:08.832
Practice
is perfection.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.335
His smile,

04:12.294 --> 04:14.171
it was like moonlight.

04:15.881 --> 04:17.758
He said it was a shame
I didn’t like the song,

04:17.925 --> 04:19.676
because it was for me.

04:19.843 --> 04:23.055
But he promised
to come back
and play it every night

04:23.222 --> 04:26.600
until he sang a song
as beautiful as me.

04:27.726 --> 04:30.771
Fortunately,
no song is that beautiful.

04:30.938 --> 04:34.691
So I got to see
and hear him every night.

04:36.443 --> 04:39.363
I dreamed of leaving
the island with him,

04:39.530 --> 04:42.491
starting a new life,
free from survival.

04:43.534 --> 04:46.620
But Deni could
never imagine leaving.

04:46.787 --> 04:50.666
He loved the people
and would give anything
to be loved in return.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.753
His dream was to one day
write a song

04:54.920 --> 04:57.381
that would unite the people
of the island...

04:58.715 --> 05:01.844
a song that would remind us
of the magic Guava had,

05:02.886 --> 05:04.847
