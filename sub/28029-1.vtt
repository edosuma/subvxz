02:34.752 --> 02:36.586

02:36.588 --> 02:37.687
Not really.

02:37.689 --> 02:39.256
But we need you.

02:39.258 --> 02:40.291
What?

02:40.293 --> 02:42.459
Do you know how we come
to church once a year?

02:42.461 --> 02:45.294

Hey, you guys. You guys.

03:36.414 --> 03:38.281
Good kids...

03:38.283 --> 03:39.316
get better gifts.

03:40.919 --> 03:43.019
Wait a minute.
You did not just do that.

03:43.021 --> 03:44.687
I did. You noticed
that, didn't you?

03:44.689 --> 03:46.590
- I did it because it works.
- That's not fair.

03:46.592 --> 03:48.858
- It worked on you for years.
- You didn't do it to me.

03:48.860 --> 03:49.959
Always, always.

03:49.961 --> 03:50.960
Look, we're home!

03:53.966 --> 03:56.365
What?

03:56.367 --> 03:57.366
What the...

03:59.671 --> 04:00.971
Oh, my God.

04:03.942 --> 04:06.980
Mom. Mom.
No. Don't!

04:14.986 --> 04:17.257
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it.

04:18.589 --> 04:19.723
Hi, Mom.

04:19.725 --> 04:21.791
Oh, let me see you.
Is it you?

04:21.793 --> 04:24.029
Is that Ben?

04:26.764 --> 04:28.332
Come on. Look.

04:28.334 --> 04:29.800
- It's Ben.
- Yeah, it is Ben.

04:29.802 --> 04:31.567
Take hold of my hand.
Come on. Hurry!

04:31.569 --> 04:32.902
Oh, my God.
I was just...

04:32.904 --> 04:34.870
I was truly just wondering.

04:34.872 --> 04:36.873
Just wondering what if.

04:36.875 --> 04:38.742
Ben!

04:38.744 --> 04:40.013
Don't let go.

04:46.451 --> 04:48.385
So, my roommate,
Timmy, has two years,

04:48.387 --> 04:50.486
and is, like,
a recovery rockstar.

04:50.488 --> 04:52.389
And he offers me
a free ride.

04:52.391 --> 04:54.457
And I was like,
"Yeah, I'm down."

04:54.459 --> 04:58.495
But I'm thinkin', there's no way
my sponsor's gonna go for this.

04:58.497 --> 04:59.596
But he did?

04:59.598 --> 05:01.630
But he did because
that's how good I'm doing.

05:01.632 --> 05:03.599
Wow, honey.

05:03.601 --> 05:05.901
So, Timmy's mom and dad and
his little brother pick us up.

05:05.903 --> 05:07.570
I'm squeezed in the middle.

05:07.572 --> 05:08.637
They're very Christian.

05:08.639 --> 05:09.839
They're all super healthy.

05:09.841 --> 05:10.841
They don't even
drink caffeine.

05:11.843 --> 05:12.909
Great.

05:12.911 --> 05:14.110
Mom, Ben is feeding Ponce.

05:14.112 --> 05:15.878
Oh, yeah. Guilty.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.748
Bread is bad for his teeth.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.815
I think a little
bit is OK, honey.

05:19.817 --> 05:21.418
OK. Go on.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.553
OK, so we're, like,
10 minutes into the ride,

05:23.555 --> 05:26.055
and suddenly
there's this smell

05:26.057 --> 05:27.656
that just hangs there.

05:27.658 --> 05:28.858
And it's a...

05:28.860 --> 05:30.394
And just when
it starts to clear,

05:30.396 --> 05:33.796
another cloud of... of
stink is unleashed.

05:33.798 --> 05:35.464
- Wait, it's human?
- Mm-hmm.

05:35.466 --> 05:36.800
- Oh, my God.
- It was the silent but deadly kind.

05:36.802 --> 05:37.868
Oh, my God.

05:37.870 --> 05:39.569
That's the worst kind.

05:39.571 --> 05:41.538
This is great.
So great.

05:41.540 --> 05:42.772
You know, Ponce,

05:42.774 --> 05:44.974
all of us in
the kitchen.

05:44.976 --> 05:46.476
You happy.

05:46.478 --> 05:47.577
Zip me, please.

05:47.579 --> 05:48.779
Oh, you got one on.

05:48.781 --> 05:49.846
Good job. OK.

05:49.848 --> 05:50.846
Leave these on.

05:50.848 --> 05:52.548
- OK? All right.
- Bye!

05:52.550 --> 05:53.617
- Be smart.
- Bye!

05:53.619 --> 05:54.784
All right.

05:54.786 --> 05:56.586
- Then what happened?
- OK, so,

05:56.588 --> 05:58.721
we're trapped in the back and
the farts just keep on coming.

05:58.723 --> 06:00.156
Front door.

06:00.158 --> 06:02.726
And so, I'm thinking, surely
someone is gonna say sorry.

06:02.728 --> 06:04.060
- Or excuse me...
- Excuse me. Yes.

06:04.062 --> 06:05.728
Or, like, maybe
crack a window.

06:05.730 --> 06:07.663
But, no, they act like
nothing is wrong.

06:07.665 --> 06:08.697
Oh, my God.

06:08.699 --> 06:09.933
So, I just said,

06:09.935 --> 06:11.635
"You know, you can
let me out here."

06:11.637 --> 06:12.868
Mom?

06:12.870 --> 06:14.204
It's not that funny.

06:14.206 --> 06:15.572
But it is.

06:15.574 --> 06:17.673
So, I just hiked the
rest of the way home.

06:17.675 --> 06:18.875
You didn't!

06:20.946 --> 06:22.779
Oh, they did it again. Ugh.

06:22.781 --> 06:25.649
- Rascals.
- All right. You're gonna regret this.

06:25.651 --> 06:26.985
Oh, go get 'em.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.553
The big brother.

06:30.555 --> 06:31.923
Aah!

06:50.242 --> 06:51.640
Mom? Mom?

06:51.642 --> 06:54.043
Did you see? He's gained
some weight and...

06:54.045 --> 06:56.146
he's got the sparkle
back in his eyes.

06:56.148 --> 06:58.113
He's clearly doing better.

06:58.115 --> 06:59.716
Then why are you
hiding everything?

06:59.718 --> 07:00.851
You know why.

07:00.853 --> 07:02.885
Sad. Having to hide.

07:02.887 --> 07:05.087
Well, I would do
the same for you.

07:05.089 --> 07:07.257
But you'll never have to.

07:07.259 --> 07:10.560
Sweetie, I've got a very
good feeling about this.

07:10.562 --> 07:11.661
Well, I don't.

07:11.663 --> 07:14.531
Listen. This time will
be different. You'll see.

07:14.533 --> 07:16.132
It will.

07:16.134 --> 07:17.868
Mom?

07:17.870 --> 07:19.269
Why is he here anyway?

07:19.271 --> 07:22.538
Weren't we supposed to
go visit him tomorrow?

07:23.675 --> 07:24.740
OK, you need to
go watch him.

07:24.742 --> 07:26.108
No.

07:26.110 --> 07:27.676
No, he'll think
I'm spying.

07:27.678 --> 07:30.747
No, then just, uh, film
him on your phone then.

07:30.749 --> 07:32.615
Hmm?

07:32.617 --> 07:33.617
Are you serious?

07:33.619 --> 07:34.750
Yes, Ivy.

07:34.752 --> 07:35.851
Now.

07:37.154 --> 07:39.288
- Yeah?
- I want hot chocolate.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.298
Go, go, go!

07:49.535 --> 07:50.834
What are you doing?

07:50.836 --> 07:53.637
I'm making a video
of holiday highlights.

07:56.708 --> 07:58.811
- Run!
- No, hurry!

08:12.156 --> 08:13.957
Hurry, hurry!

08:23.701 --> 08:24.868
Come here, boy!

08:24.870 --> 08:26.803
Come on, Ponce!

08:28.706 --> 08:30.307
Let's go!

08:42.687 --> 08:43.953
Don't do that.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.055
No...

09:55.027 --> 09:58.862
How about 15 extra minutes of
screen time starting right now?

09:58.864 --> 10:00.199
Yay!

10:04.836 --> 10:06.238
We better hurry up!

10:08.940 --> 10:10.242
I'm... I'm confused.

10:12.977 --> 10:15.146
I thought we had
an understanding.

10:16.847 --> 10:18.381
The therapists.

10:18.383 --> 10:19.348
The doctors.

10:19.350 --> 10:22.451
Everyone, even... even
you, agreed that it's in

10:22.453 --> 10:24.153
your best interest

10:24.155 --> 10:26.222
not to be home yet.

10:26.224 --> 10:27.156
I know.

10:27.158 --> 10:30.859
There's too many
triggers for you here.

10:30.861 --> 10:32.061
That was months ago.

10:32.063 --> 10:33.930
And, and, and
your sponsor said...

10:33.932 --> 10:36.733
Please, let... let Ben
tell me, please.

10:36.735 --> 10:37.733
Please, honey.

10:37.735 --> 10:40.002
OK, I know...

10:40.004 --> 10:42.204
I know I really fucked up
last Christmas.

10:42.206 --> 10:44.210
And the one before that.

10:46.344 --> 10:47.844
It's true.

10:47.846 --> 10:51.116
Yeah, I know I've made
a lot of mistakes.

10:51.850 --> 10:54.084
But...

10:54.086 --> 10:55.819
Now, since I'm doing so good,

10:55.821 --> 10:59.455
and... and with all the support
I'm getting and...

10:59.457 --> 11:02.358
w-with my sponsor?

11:02.360 --> 11:05.261
I honestly didn't
think I'd ever...

11:05.263 --> 11:06.699
feel this good again.

11:11.903 --> 11:13.368
What? You don't believe me?

11:13.370 --> 11:14.469
Sweetie, we do.

11:14.471 --> 11:17.239
Which is why she hid all
the meds and the jewelry.

11:17.241 --> 11:19.844
I was just removing
the temptation.

11:21.913 --> 11:24.917
Wow. Fuck. You're all
still scared of me.

11:26.884 --> 11:30.423
Which is the last thing
I wanna make any of you feel.

11:33.958 --> 11:36.861
You should just... you
should take me back.

11:43.501 --> 11:45.103
Mom, take me back.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.205
<i>Front door.</i>

11:52.110 --> 11:54.911
- Mom?
- You should have known better.

11:54.913 --> 11:56.246
Don't blame him.

11:56.248 --> 11:58.147
It's my fault.

11:58.149 --> 12:00.983
When he called and asked
what I wanted for Christmas,

12:00.985 --> 12:03.085
I shouldn't have
said him home.

12:03.087 --> 12:04.253
That's what you said?

12:04.255 --> 12:06.122
I wanted him to know
I missed him.

12:06.124 --> 12:08.424
I didn't... I never
dreamed he would just...

12:08.426 --> 12:10.359
show up.

12:10.361 --> 12:11.460
Is he in the car?

12:11.462 --> 12:13.463
Yup.

12:13.465 --> 12:15.364
It's not like he
came home to stay.

12:15.366 --> 12:17.934
Obviously, that can't
happen right now.

12:17.936 --> 12:19.334
It wouldn't be
good for him.

12:19.336 --> 12:20.469
He needs to go back.

12:20.471 --> 12:22.070
I agree.

12:22.072 --> 12:23.339
And if it weren't Christmas...

12:23.341 --> 12:25.340
It's the right
thing, honey.

12:25.342 --> 12:26.242
It is, Mom.

12:26.244 --> 12:28.011
We hope. We don't know.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.445
I mean, honestly...

12:29.447 --> 12:32.080
I'm so goddamn angry at
the two of you right now.

12:32.082 --> 12:33.081
I am.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.184
What did I do?

12:34.186 --> 12:35.951
You gave up on him.

12:35.953 --> 12:37.052
You both have.

12:37.054 --> 12:39.122
This is not giving up.

12:39.124 --> 12:41.424
- It is.
- It's... no, it... it's giving a shit,

12:41.426 --> 12:44.026
which we do, about
what's best for him.

12:44.028 --> 12:45.195
And for you.

12:45.197 --> 12:46.863
You have a problem
with him, Neal.

12:46.865 --> 12:49.165
No, I'm rooting for him,
but I'm frustrated.

12:49.167 --> 12:50.867
He's lucky,
and we're...

12:50.869 --> 12:52.368
- We're playing loose with it.
- OK, Neal.

12:52.370 --> 12:54.570
If he were black,
he would be in jail by now.

12:54.572 --> 12:56.138
Maybe this isn't the time.

12:56.140 --> 12:58.208
We said we weren't
going to do this again.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.912
Remember?

13:01.413 --> 13:03.414
I remember.

13:09.421 --> 13:10.923
Holly?

13:11.856 --> 13:12.988
Here's the list.

13:12.990 --> 13:14.324
I don't care
who gets what.

13:14.326 --> 13:15.224
Just get it done.

13:15.226 --> 13:16.995
Yeah.

13:29.206 --> 13:31.143
God, damn it!

13:32.076 --> 13:34.145
God, damn it!

13:35.480 --> 13:37.015
We're all set.

13:48.225 --> 13:49.258
It's okay, Mom.

13:49.260 --> 13:50.962
It's for the best.

13:53.631 --> 13:55.300
Seat belt, please.

14:07.946 --> 14:09.378
Mom.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.046
Mom!

14:18.023 --> 14:19.291
What?

14:21.025 --> 14:23.225
I'm thinking.

14:35.005 --> 14:37.175
All right. Come on.

14:48.285 --> 14:49.618
OK.

14:49.620 --> 14:52.722
Here's the deal, and
it is not negotiable.

14:52.724 --> 14:54.293
You get a day.

14:55.125 --> 14:56.693
Are you sure?

14:56.695 --> 14:59.127
So long as you pass the drug
test I'm about to administer.

14:59.129 --> 15:00.629
Stay clean while you're here,

15:00.631 --> 15:03.098
and that this time tomorrow
you are back in Sober Living.

15:03.100 --> 15:04.267
Yeah, OK.

15:04.269 --> 15:05.535
Now, I'm not done.

15:05.537 --> 15:06.603
These are our terms,

15:06.605 --> 15:09.171
and I don't give a shit
if you hate these rules.

15:09.173 --> 15:11.574
You do not leave
my sight ever.

15:11.576 --> 15:14.042
You do not close
the door to your room,

15:14.044 --> 15:16.212
where, by the way, I will
be sleeping on the floor,

15:16.214 --> 15:17.446
and if you try
to sneak off,

15:17.448 --> 15:19.181
if your bed so much
as make squeak,

15:19.183 --> 15:21.084
I will be all over you

15:21.086 --> 15:25.356
because, for the next 24 hours,
you are mine. All mine. Got it?

15:26.157 --> 15:27.459
I got it.

15:28.460 --> 15:29.392
Good.

15:29.394 --> 15:31.096
Let's get you tested.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.069
Mom.

15:40.071 --> 15:42.504
Relax, I'm not going to be
looking at your privates.

15:42.506 --> 15:43.339
OK, then.

15:43.341 --> 15:45.273
I will be keeping
my eyes on you.

15:45.275 --> 15:47.078
Just like I said.

15:51.249 --> 15:52.448
This is so not cool.

15:52.450 --> 15:55.086
Nothing about this
is cool, Ben.

15:59.157 --> 16:00.189
Come on, pee-pee time.

16:00.191 --> 16:01.757
Shut up.

16:03.461 --> 16:05.494
Do you want me to
turn the faucet on?

16:05.496 --> 16:06.631
Stop.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.633
- Shh.
- All right, all right, all right.

16:11.635 --> 16:14.203
- Sometimes it helps.
- Mm-hmm.

16:14.205 --> 16:15.671
- What are you doing?
- OK.

16:15.673 --> 16:19.175
- There's a surprise coming.
- What surprise?

16:19.177 --> 16:20.343
Do you trust me?

16:20.345 --> 16:21.344
- Yes!
- Yes, I do.

16:21.346 --> 16:22.811
Awesome. That's awesome.

16:22.813 --> 16:24.546
Good. Good to hear.

16:24.548 --> 16:25.415
All right.

16:25.417 --> 16:27.282
- You close your eyes.
- Yeah.

16:27.284 --> 16:29.151
- Can you see anything?
- No.

16:29.153 --> 16:30.489
OK, no peaking.

16:33.357 --> 16:35.257
I hear something.

16:35.259 --> 16:37.660
- When I was your age, this was my favorite.
- It's gross.

16:37.662 --> 16:39.695
Ivy, chill out.

16:39.697 --> 16:42.065
Liam doesn't like crust.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.269
There's a crust-less option

16:44.802 --> 16:46.201
in the works.

16:46.203 --> 16:47.538
Oh, really?

16:49.274 --> 16:50.640
Are you two ready?

16:50.642 --> 16:51.840
Yes.

16:51.842 --> 16:53.508
<i>Back door.</i>

16:53.510 --> 16:56.481
OK, open your eyes and feast.

17:00.418 --> 17:02.350
- Yum!
- Right?

17:02.352 --> 17:04.152
It's really good.

17:04.154 --> 17:05.421
What have you done?

17:05.423 --> 17:07.222
I know. I know.
There's no going back.

17:07.223 --> 17:11.393
Mm-hmm. More, please!

17:11.395 --> 17:13.662
But Ashley's
wings have glitter.

17:13.664 --> 17:17.232
Well, we are going to bedazzle
these things like crazy.

17:17.233 --> 17:18.834
Mom, seriously,
they're so good.

17:18.836 --> 17:20.236
I don't want to brag.

17:20.238 --> 17:22.270
Well, yeah, I do.
These are gonna be good.

17:26.711 --> 17:28.212
Ben?

17:40.290 --> 17:42.859
Boy. Hey, buddy.

17:47.231 --> 17:48.230
Hi Mama.

17:48.232 --> 17:50.298
You knew it.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.301
You came back for Ponce.

17:52.303 --> 17:54.202
Busted.

17:54.204 --> 17:55.473
Actually, no.

18:05.849 --> 18:07.752
OK, let's party.

18:12.390 --> 18:13.555
You know, I really
wouldn't appreciate it if you leave me.

18:13.557 --> 18:14.757
- <i>Holly.</i>
- Hi.

18:14.759 --> 18:15.691
<i>How'd the test go?</i>

18:15.693 --> 18:17.626
- Negative.
- <i>That's great.</i>

18:17.628 --> 18:18.594
Yeah.

18:18.596 --> 18:20.729
And he's
helping out with chores.

18:20.731 --> 18:23.199
- <i>Really?</i>
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

18:23.201 --> 18:24.432
<i>OK, well...</i>

18:24.434 --> 18:26.736
<i>I left word with
Sober Living.</i>

18:26.738 --> 18:28.837
OK.

18:28.839 --> 18:32.510
It hurts to think about
the shit I've done.

18:33.912 --> 18:35.911
And what I'm learning in
recovery is I can't undo

18:35.913 --> 18:38.847
what I've done, but I can
do it differently now.

18:38.849 --> 18:40.182
I think we're good here.

18:40.184 --> 18:41.449
One... just one sec, Ivy.

18:41.451 --> 18:43.518
What I mean is, is
I have to be present.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.754
I have to be present.

18:44.756 --> 18:46.655
- It's about this log.
- OK.

18:46.657 --> 18:48.391
- It's about this log. It's...
- That's enough.

18:48.393 --> 18:50.660
It's about taking care of
this log and placing it here.

18:50.662 --> 18:52.728
And I have to take
it one log at a time,

18:52.730 --> 18:54.930
- No, stop.
- otherwise it's not gonna...

18:54.932 --> 18:56.535
Ben, stop!

19:05.410 --> 19:06.808
Aah!

19:06.810 --> 19:08.411
- God!
- Come on. You got this.

19:08.413 --> 19:10.680
Come on.

19:10.682 --> 19:13.248
Fine. Just leave it.
We don't need anymore, Ben.

19:13.250 --> 19:14.883
Cleaning up your mess.

19:14.885 --> 19:18.286
- We'll do it. We're gonna do it.
- Aah!

19:18.288 --> 19:20.422
- It's so heavy!
- I got it. I got it.

19:20.424 --> 19:23.692
- You're good. You're good.
- Ponce!

19:23.694 --> 19:25.294
Nice. OK.

19:28.566 --> 19:30.565
We're in no danger
of it burning out.

19:30.567 --> 19:33.469
What the fuck is this?
Where did our ornaments go?

19:33.471 --> 19:35.438
They don't share
the current aesthetic.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.606
Is there a problem?

19:37.608 --> 19:41.009
Ben was just asking where
our old ornaments are.

19:41.011 --> 19:42.580
Did you throw them away?

19:50.255 --> 19:51.557
Come with me.

19:57.428 --> 19:59.996
Be quick and
be careful, yeah?

19:59.998 --> 20:02.601
- Mommy!
- Yes, yes. OK.

20:13.744 --> 20:15.479
Do you see 'em?

20:17.615 --> 20:19.651
It should be right there.

20:31.296 --> 20:33.296
Ben?

20:33.298 --> 20:34.596
Fuck!

20:34.598 --> 20:35.831
Ben?

20:35.833 --> 20:36.935
Can you come up?

20:44.041 --> 20:47.543
- That's it.
- I hate it up here.

20:47.545 --> 20:48.643
OK, then let's go already.

20:48.645 --> 20:50.379
Wait...

20:50.381 --> 20:51.883
I need you to check.

20:52.950 --> 20:54.553
I'm, uh...

20:55.920 --> 20:57.987
I used to stash
my... my, um...

20:57.989 --> 20:59.955
OK.

21:05.395 --> 21:06.731
Back there?

21:09.666 --> 21:13.638
If there's something there, then
you have to make it go away.

21:21.913 --> 21:23.414
Nothing.

21:29.386 --> 21:30.688
We're good.

21:31.955 --> 21:33.424
I'll help you down.

21:36.027 --> 21:37.696
Come on. Let's go.

21:56.713 --> 21:59.014
Oh, wow. Ben.

21:59.016 --> 22:01.816
Nice.

22:01.818 --> 22:04.056
Liam, I have
a pine cone nose.

22:05.690 --> 22:08.026
This is better.

22:09.727 --> 22:11.760
- Yeah.
- Yeah, cotton balls.

22:11.762 --> 22:14.965
Ben, Ivy, can you
two come with me, please?

22:16.601 --> 22:19.701
I know, I went a
little overboard this year.

22:19.703 --> 22:21.603
- Mom?
- Keep wrapping.

22:22.740 --> 22:23.972
Hello?

22:23.974 --> 22:25.074
- <i>Hey, honey.</i>
- <i>Yeah?</i>

22:25.076 --> 22:26.174
<i>They only have regular.</i>

22:26.176 --> 22:27.742
No.

22:27.744 --> 22:29.711
Organic cranberries.

22:29.713 --> 22:32.748
Mom, we don't
have to be 100%...

22:32.750 --> 22:34.616
It's important.

22:34.618 --> 22:35.985
- <i>Got it.</i>
- <i>OK.</i>

22:35.987 --> 22:37.018
Thank you.

22:38.855 --> 22:40.155
Ugh, gotta love that Neal.

22:40.157 --> 22:41.757
Mom?

22:41.759 --> 22:43.859
Running all my last-minute
errands so we can just...

22:43.861 --> 22:46.027
- stay here till church.
- Mom. Mom, I wanna do some shopping of my own.

22:46.029 --> 22:46.862
Why?

22:46.864 --> 22:49.064
I wanna get them
something from me.

22:49.066 --> 22:52.535
Well, sweetie,
you are the present.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.103
Something that
they can unwrap.

22:54.105 --> 22:56.639
Well, OK. Let's just say these
are from you, then.

22:56.641 --> 22:58.641
But they're not really from me.
I didn't pick them out.

22:58.643 --> 22:59.741
They'll never know.

22:59.743 --> 23:01.443
But I'll know.

23:01.445 --> 23:04.747
All right. Well, honestly,
they have everything they need.

23:04.749 --> 23:06.815
They really don't
need anything more.

23:06.817 --> 23:07.650
So true.

23:07.652 --> 23:09.184
OK, but...

23:09.186 --> 23:11.653
if I didn't pick them out,
then they're not really from me,

23:11.655 --> 23:13.122
which makes me a liar.

23:13.124 --> 23:15.024
And the whole point of this

23:15.026 --> 23:16.124
is to be honest.

23:16.126 --> 23:18.227
It's no good if
I'm not honest.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.046
This is nice.

23:37.048 --> 23:39.785
Getting to spend a little
quality alone time together.

23:45.088 --> 23:47.625
What do you think
you'll wear tonight?

23:48.526 --> 23:49.924
This is all I brought.

23:49.926 --> 23:53.629
Oh, well, no worries.
We can pick up a sweater

23:53.631 --> 23:56.701
or maybe even
a whole new ensemble.

23:57.234 --> 23:58.702
Ensemble?

24:00.171 --> 24:03.171
That way you'll... I want
you to be comfortable.

24:03.173 --> 24:04.606
Oh, I'm okay with just...

24:04.608 --> 24:06.241
No, come on.

24:06.243 --> 24:09.079
It's Christmas Eve. We're
gonna be in a front pew.

24:14.719 --> 24:16.251
Hey, Burns!

24:16.253 --> 24:17.819
What's going on?

24:17.821 --> 24:21.025
- Hey, man.
- Wow, it's been a long time.

24:21.826 --> 24:23.627
I thought you were dead.

24:25.262 --> 24:26.728
What's new?

24:26.730 --> 24:30.132
- I'm... I'm good.
- Yeah?

24:30.134 --> 24:32.634
Dude, it's... it's
really good to see you.

24:32.636 --> 24:34.536
- Yeah.
- And you look good.

24:34.538 --> 24:35.537
Oh, thank you.

24:35.539 --> 24:36.875
OK.

24:41.311 --> 24:43.879
He was a little full of
himself, don't you think?

24:43.881 --> 24:45.680
He's all right.

24:45.682 --> 24:48.017
And what's his drug of choice?
You know he has one.

24:48.019 --> 24:50.686
- Speed? Weekend cocaine?
- Mom.

24:50.688 --> 24:53.322
- High caffeinated energy drinks?
- Mom.

24:53.324 --> 24:58.227
All I'm saying is you
forget how special you are.

24:58.229 --> 24:59.795
You just don't... you don't...

24:59.797 --> 25:01.596
Well, people look up to
you, and they love you.

25:01.598 --> 25:04.866
You're a natural leader,
and you are so, so smart.

25:04.868 --> 25:06.768
No, Mom, Ivy is smart.

25:06.770 --> 25:08.770
Well, nobody wants
to be that smart.

25:08.772 --> 25:12.607
It's not like she's having a
tremendous amount of fun, hmm?

25:12.609 --> 25:13.308
What was my point?

25:13.310 --> 25:14.776
You don't have a point.

25:14.778 --> 25:15.944
I do have a point.

25:15.946 --> 25:17.813
My point is, look,
you lick this,

25:17.815 --> 25:19.815
and who knows
how far you can go

25:19.817 --> 25:21.049
and what you can do.

25:21.051 --> 25:23.187
There's so much to
look forward to.

25:34.731 --> 25:37.600
OK, honey, you've
barely touched your breakfast.

25:37.602 --> 25:40.071
You've got to eat this.
Come on now.

25:40.904 --> 25:41.903
Mrs. Crane.

25:41.905 --> 25:43.104
Dr. Crane.

25:43.106 --> 25:44.675
Oh, hello.

25:45.609 --> 25:46.810
Do I know you?

25:47.778 --> 25:49.711
Holly Burns.

25:49.713 --> 25:52.146
Yes. Oh, yes.

25:52.148 --> 25:55.249
He doesn't always remember.

25:55.251 --> 25:59.254
Holly is the mother of Ivy,
whose singing we love.

25:59.256 --> 26:01.323
She was your patient.

26:01.325 --> 26:02.991
I remember.

26:02.993 --> 26:05.760
You must
be so proud of her.

26:05.762 --> 26:08.299
I am proud of all
of my children, yes.

26:17.842 --> 26:20.345
Oh, fuck.

26:24.315 --> 26:26.315
Oh, look, I need
to get a napkin. I...

26:26.317 --> 26:27.850
I'll sit with him.

26:27.852 --> 26:29.718
You're a dear.

26:29.720 --> 26:30.822
Be right back.

26:32.789 --> 26:37.793
So, if you remember Ivy, then
you must remember my son, Ben.

26:37.795 --> 26:39.061
Right over there.

26:39.063 --> 26:40.332
Who?

26:43.366 --> 26:44.967
- I don't remember him.
- Hmm.

26:44.969 --> 26:48.036
I understand.
You had so many patients.

26:48.038 --> 26:50.271
But when was 14,
he had a small

26:50.273 --> 26:52.207
snowboarding injury.

26:52.209 --> 26:54.375
And you prescribed
painkillers.

26:54.377 --> 26:58.113
And when I asked, you told
me they weren't addictive

26:58.115 --> 27:00.282
and kept upping his dose,
and he got hooked,

27:00.284 --> 27:01.816
and it fucked up his life.

27:01.818 --> 27:03.451
So, you can pretend
you don't remember,

27:03.453 --> 27:05.720
but I won't forget.

27:05.722 --> 27:08.359
I hope you die
a horrible death.

27:11.194 --> 27:13.228
Merry Christmas.

27:13.230 --> 27:15.099
I'm just here for a day.

27:17.067 --> 27:18.199
OK. Yeah.

27:18.201 --> 27:19.703
I will.

27:20.471 --> 27:23.375
OK. Yes. I gotta go.
I gotta go.

27:24.942 --> 27:26.141
Who was that?

27:26.143 --> 27:28.142
Um, my... my sponsor.

27:28.144 --> 27:30.446
I'm feeling...
I'm feeling shaky.

27:30.448 --> 27:32.914
So, I... that's
why I called him.

27:32.916 --> 27:34.248
He told me to
go to a meeting.

27:34.250 --> 27:35.450
They all say that.

27:35.452 --> 27:38.386
Whenever you feel shaky,
get to a meeting.

27:38.388 --> 27:40.889
OK, well, let's just
get your clothes...

27:40.891 --> 27:42.894
I gotta find a meeting. Now.

27:45.863 --> 27:47.132
Did you hear me?

27:47.765 --> 27:49.797
OK.

27:49.799 --> 27:51.933
I'm so proud of you.

27:51.935 --> 27:53.134
Knowing what you need.

27:53.136 --> 27:55.304
I just, I think
it's so great.

27:55.306 --> 27:58.940
Like they say, it's
working when you...

27:58.942 --> 28:00.109
What do they say?

28:00.111 --> 28:01.209
It works if you work it.

28:01.211 --> 28:02.244
It works if you work it.

28:02.246 --> 28:03.277
Well, you are working it.

28:03.279 --> 28:04.412
Oh, let's go in.

28:04.414 --> 28:05.881
You're not coming in.

28:05.883 --> 28:07.282
No, why? Of course I am.

28:07.284 --> 28:08.750
No, Mom, I-I'm... I'm good.

28:08.752 --> 28:10.251
It's... it's a... it's a meeting.

28:10.253 --> 28:11.886
I'm gonna come right
out afterwards. No.

28:11.888 --> 28:12.787
I may just tag along.

28:12.789 --> 28:14.288
- Hi!
- Mom.

28:14.290 --> 28:15.891
- Hey, yo, what's up, baby?
- Hello.

28:15.893 --> 28:17.025
- How are you?
- Hey, how you doing?

28:17.027 --> 28:18.126
Stop.

28:18.128 --> 28:19.128
Never hurts to
be friendly.

28:19.130 --> 28:20.129
Dial it down.

28:20.131 --> 28:21.130
OK.

28:21.132 --> 28:22.296
Maybe I'll just... Hi!

28:22.298 --> 28:23.902
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

28:25.035 --> 28:26.738
Everybody seems so nice.

28:32.509 --> 28:34.042
The minute I think I have it,

28:34.044 --> 28:37.045
the minute I think
I've got this, uh...

28:37.047 --> 28:38.479
it's waiting, you know?

28:38.481 --> 28:40.516
It's out there, doing
push-ups right now

28:40.518 --> 28:42.316
while we're sitting in
these folding chairs.

28:42.318 --> 28:45.921
So, I'm really, really grateful
to be here with all of you.

28:45.923 --> 28:48.222
And I-I thank you
for keeping me clean.

28:48.224 --> 28:50.092
Thank you for
letting me share.

28:50.094 --> 28:51.160
So, uh...

28:51.162 --> 28:53.230
Thank you.

28:55.499 --> 28:57.165
Go on to show of hands?

28:57.167 --> 28:59.934
I have a deep
fear of using.

28:59.936 --> 29:03.305
I have a deep fear of going
back into those dark places.

29:03.307 --> 29:06.007
This fellowship,
this group of people,

29:06.009 --> 29:07.809
is what keeps me alive.

29:07.811 --> 29:10.578
You know, I have two
new baby nieces,

29:10.580 --> 29:13.915
and they're going to meet
me for the first time.

29:13.917 --> 29:18.286
I'm just so grateful that
they'll never know me high.

29:18.288 --> 29:20.959
They'll just know
me as... as me.

29:22.358 --> 29:25.294
Hi, I'm Ben, and I,
um, I'm an addict.

29:25.296 --> 29:27.129
Hey, Ben.

29:27.131 --> 29:29.264
I got 77 days.

29:33.470 --> 29:36.604
And, uh, that's
my most ever.

29:36.606 --> 29:38.974
So, I just want
to get to 78...

29:38.976 --> 29:40.007
right now.

29:40.009 --> 29:42.276
Um, so, I, uh...

29:42.278 --> 29:45.046
I called my sponsor and...

29:45.048 --> 29:49.284
the thing about my sponsor is
that he's a... he's a loud talker.

29:49.286 --> 29:53.555
And, so, uh, I say,
"Hey," and he goes,

29:53.557 --> 29:55.023
"What's up?"

29:55.025 --> 29:57.058
And I was like, "Well,
I-I got big news.

29:57.060 --> 29:59.428
I just bought presents that I
actually picked out for someone."

29:59.430 --> 30:03.131
And he was like, "Oh, well,
you're feeling pretty good, huh?"

30:03.133 --> 30:06.602
And I was like, "Yeah, you know,
I actually feel like I'm being honest."

30:06.604 --> 30:09.103
And, well, he said,
"If you were honest, Ben,

30:09.105 --> 30:13.007
you'd look in the mirror and
say, I'm a great big phony."

30:13.009 --> 30:14.442
So, I was like, "OK."

30:14.444 --> 30:16.143
"Because Ben you're
a fucking addict,

30:16.145 --> 30:18.646
and you're the last person who
should believe his own bullshit.

30:18.648 --> 30:20.449
So, now get to a meeting."

30:20.451 --> 30:22.383
So, here I am.

30:22.385 --> 30:25.187
77 days clean.

30:25.189 --> 30:28.289
Some things are better now.

30:28.291 --> 30:30.191
Like I can actually
take a shit.

30:32.363 --> 30:35.197
Yeah, uh, even
better than that,

30:35.199 --> 30:38.436
I'm waking up more often
than not with an erection.

30:40.938 --> 30:41.670
Sorry, Mom.

30:41.672 --> 30:43.508
And my... yeah, my mom's here.

30:45.174 --> 30:46.476
Um...

30:48.645 --> 30:52.049
I've put her
through a lot, um...

30:53.951 --> 30:56.450
This summer, she found me
upside down on the stairs

30:56.452 --> 30:59.389
with, um, a needle in my arm.

31:00.356 --> 31:01.625
And, uh...

31:03.093 --> 31:05.928
with my dog trying
to keep me awake.

31:05.930 --> 31:07.028
So...

31:07.030 --> 31:09.498
The doctor said that if
it weren't for my dog,

31:09.500 --> 31:11.266
I... I would be dead.

31:11.268 --> 31:14.268
Um, and my mom.

31:14.270 --> 31:18.673
Without her, I wouldn't be
here right now in this room.

31:18.675 --> 31:24.446
Uh, the things that
I've done to myself

31:24.448 --> 31:25.950
and others.

31:28.652 --> 31:32.321
Uh, so, I don't...
Why am I still...

31:32.323 --> 31:34.392
here?

31:36.226 --> 31:38.259
There's gotta be a reason.

31:38.261 --> 31:39.961
Maybe it's to...

31:39.963 --> 31:42.564
come back and... and make
this Christmas right

31:42.566 --> 31:44.665
or maybe this
is the biggest

31:44.667 --> 31:47.469
fucking mistake of my life.

31:47.471 --> 31:50.505
Um, anyways,
here I am.

31:50.507 --> 31:51.640
Still here.

31:51.642 --> 31:54.178
So, thank you.
Thank you for...

31:58.715 --> 32:00.548
...grant us the serenity

32:00.550 --> 32:03.184
to accept the things
we cannot change,

32:03.186 --> 32:06.087
the courage to change
the things we can,

32:06.089 --> 32:08.457
and the wisdom to
know the difference.

32:08.459 --> 32:12.397
Keep coming back.
It works if you work it.

32:19.269 --> 32:21.402
Ben?

32:21.404 --> 32:23.671
- Ben. Good job, sweetie.
- Thanks.

32:23.673 --> 32:25.440
And you coming back
was not a mistake.

32:25.442 --> 32:29.678
Someone wiser than me, your
sponsor, said you can do this.

32:29.680 --> 32:32.546
OK.
Yeah. That's right.

32:32.548 --> 32:34.548
I think some people
want to talk to you.

32:34.550 --> 32:35.549
I'll just wait over here.

32:35.551 --> 32:37.087
OK.

32:38.422 --> 32:40.488
Hey, man.
Thanks for your share.

32:40.490 --> 32:41.789
It's been a long time, yo.

32:41.791 --> 32:45.026
- Yeah.
- That really hit home.

32:45.028 --> 32:47.432
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you.

32:52.669 --> 32:54.135
Hey.

32:54.137 --> 32:55.437
I-I loved what you said.

32:55.439 --> 32:57.104
You were... you
were very funny.

32:57.106 --> 33:00.142
There's not enough
funny around here.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.309
Thanks.

33:02.311 --> 33:04.112
- You're the mom?
- Yes.

33:04.114 --> 33:05.146
I am.

33:05.148 --> 33:06.314
It's great you
came with him.

33:06.316 --> 33:07.248
Aw, I hope so.

33:07.250 --> 33:09.383
No, my mom died before
I ever got clean.

33:09.385 --> 33:12.554
I would have given anything for
her to see me get my shit together.

33:12.556 --> 33:14.057
I'm sure.

33:18.095 --> 33:19.394
It was honest.

33:19.396 --> 33:25.734
And it was you saying it.
Someone young and hot. Oh, shit.

33:25.736 --> 33:29.438
- Oh, uh, it's... that's okay.
- Oh, I'm blushing... I'm blushing now.

33:29.440 --> 33:32.140
That makes me nervous.

33:32.142 --> 33:33.842
- Is it your first meeting?
- Uh, yeah.

33:33.844 --> 33:36.411
- I'm, you know, new to it all, so...
- Yeah?

33:36.413 --> 33:37.778
Well, you should
get a sponsor.

33:37.780 --> 33:39.680
Um, it should
be a woman.

33:39.682 --> 33:42.217
It should be someone
really tough, who will

33:42.219 --> 33:44.585
you know, call you
on your bullshit, and

33:44.587 --> 33:49.190
it's all about, you know,
rigorous honesty.

33:49.192 --> 33:50.758
Oh, they're just
talking program.

33:50.760 --> 33:53.094
It's how we help
each other.

33:53.096 --> 33:53.895
OK.

33:53.897 --> 33:55.729
So, nothing to
worry about then.

33:55.731 --> 33:58.101
Oh, I didn't say that.

34:00.503 --> 34:02.740
You don't remember, do you?

34:08.244 --> 34:09.780
You were my dealer.

34:11.248 --> 34:12.514
Oh, fuck.

34:12.516 --> 34:13.681
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

34:13.684 --> 34:16.117
No, it's fine.
I'm, uh...

34:16.119 --> 34:18.719
I'm going to rehab the
day after Christmas, so,

34:18.722 --> 34:20.822
that's why I, um, I,
you know, I related to

34:20.824 --> 34:22.757
so much to what
you were saying.

34:22.759 --> 34:25.630
It was very inspiring, so...

34:27.731 --> 34:30.599
I just want... I just want to
get high just one last time.

34:30.601 --> 34:31.632
That's normal.

34:31.635 --> 34:33.199
I'm not going to, though.

34:33.202 --> 34:36.137
Good. Don't.

34:36.139 --> 34:38.141
Unless I could
do it with you.

34:49.552 --> 34:50.851
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:50.853 --> 34:53.190
- Have a good one.
- Merry Christmas.

34:59.762 --> 35:02.930
I think this one will work.

35:02.932 --> 35:04.865
Or this.

35:04.867 --> 35:06.601
And they have it
in light blue.

35:06.603 --> 35:09.470
And everybody looks
good in light blue.

35:09.472 --> 35:10.639
- Ben?
- What?

35:10.641 --> 35:11.639
Which?

35:11.641 --> 35:12.907
Yes.

35:12.909 --> 35:13.775
Good.

35:13.777 --> 35:15.313
OK, light blue.

35:19.315 --> 35:22.550
Looks like she's gonna have
you try on the whole store.

35:24.688 --> 35:25.720
Thank you so much.

35:25.722 --> 35:27.322
You're welcome.

35:27.324 --> 35:29.925
These will both complement
your complexion as a gift

35:29.927 --> 35:31.659
from your mother.
You're welcome.

35:31.661 --> 35:32.726
- Coat, please.
- OK.

35:32.728 --> 35:34.896
Nice. I'm good.

35:34.898 --> 35:36.233
Come on.

35:43.539 --> 35:44.875
Pockets.

35:52.748 --> 35:54.382
This is humiliating.

35:54.384 --> 35:55.450
Shh.

35:55.452 --> 35:58.656
No, this is love.

35:59.922 --> 36:01.791
All right.
Free to go.

36:04.561 --> 36:06.396
You didn't check my shoes.

36:14.938 --> 36:16.470
That's not funny.

36:16.472 --> 36:17.606
It was a joke, Mom.

36:17.608 --> 36:18.873
Ben.

36:18.875 --> 36:20.374
- Mom, it was a joke.
- It's not funny.

36:20.376 --> 36:21.443
Excuse me?

36:21.445 --> 36:23.744
Can I get a key
to this door, please?

36:23.746 --> 36:25.579
Unlock the door, Ben.
Right now.

36:25.581 --> 36:26.615
Ben.

36:27.650 --> 36:29.617
Open the door.

36:29.619 --> 36:30.851
This is not funny.

36:30.853 --> 36:32.554
Open this fucking door

36:32.556 --> 36:33.554
right now.

36:33.556 --> 36:34.856
Ben. God, damn it.

36:34.858 --> 36:36.794
Open this fucking door.

36:39.396 --> 36:40.865
What is going on?

36:44.367 --> 36:45.670
What's going on?

37:01.617 --> 37:04.019
Fuck. You stupid fuck.

37:04.021 --> 37:04.853
Hey.

37:04.855 --> 37:06.155
Where did you get this?

37:06.157 --> 37:07.921
- I've been with you the whole time.
- Excuse me.

37:07.923 --> 37:09.291
The... the... the girl
at the meeting.

37:09.293 --> 37:10.791
The one that
you're helping.

37:10.793 --> 37:12.661
She was gonna use, now,
so I took it from her.

37:12.663 --> 37:13.662
Excuse me.
I'm gonna have to

37:13.664 --> 37:14.862
ask you two to leave.

37:14.864 --> 37:16.563
She was gonna use.
Now she can't.

37:16.565 --> 37:18.532
Mom, the last time I didn't
help someone they died.

37:18.534 --> 37:19.836
Ma'am?

37:23.507 --> 37:25.572
You think I'm an idiot.

37:25.574 --> 37:27.876
- Can you please just exit the store?
- Yes!

37:27.878 --> 37:28.976
Fuck. Maybe she's a dealer.

37:28.978 --> 37:31.579
- What?
- Maybe she played me.

37:31.581 --> 37:34.316
- You can't trust addicts, Mom. All we do is fucking lie.
- What do I do with that?

37:34.318 --> 37:35.617
I don't... I don't know.
I don't know.

37:35.619 --> 37:37.021
Mind your own
fucking business.

37:39.989 --> 37:41.588
Mom. What...?

37:41.590 --> 37:42.923
Get out of the car.

37:42.925 --> 37:44.694
What is this?

37:47.396 --> 37:48.630
What're we doing here?

37:48.632 --> 37:50.001
Get out of the car.

37:50.599 --> 37:52.534
Now.

37:52.536 --> 37:55.570
- Why are you...
- Because I'll be too angry to do it at the time.

37:55.572 --> 37:57.371
Huh? So, where?

37:57.373 --> 37:58.405
Where do you wanna be?

37:58.407 --> 37:59.807
Oh.

37:59.809 --> 38:01.575
Don't say next to grandpa.
That's prime placement.

38:01.577 --> 38:02.876
And you don't get
that when you OD.

38:02.878 --> 38:04.612
- I'm not gonna OD.
- So, where?

38:04.614 --> 38:05.813
The new section is nice,

38:05.815 --> 38:07.749
or do you want to
be near a tree?

38:07.751 --> 38:09.016
I don't know.

38:09.018 --> 38:10.818
Well, you better
figure it out.

38:10.820 --> 38:13.054
OK, why... why don't you
cremate me and sprinkle me over

38:13.056 --> 38:15.090
Mrs. Blink, my second grade
teacher? She was pretty hot.

38:15.092 --> 38:17.691
- No, you don't get to be a smart ass about this, young man.
- Ow!

38:17.693 --> 38:18.892
I wasn't gonna use.

38:18.894 --> 38:20.628
I was... I-I'm
not gonna use.

38:20.630 --> 38:22.130
- You just...
- I'm just... Mom.

38:22.132 --> 38:23.498
You just told me.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.900
I should never believe you.

38:25.902 --> 38:27.905
Don't say another
fucking word.

38:29.505 --> 38:32.606
Just tell me, son,

38:32.608 --> 38:34.911
where you want
me to bury you.

38:38.148 --> 38:39.650
I'll wait all day.

38:40.916 --> 38:43.918
I'm not going to die.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.824
That's right.
You will, and soon.

39:08.778 --> 39:10.878
Mommy's here!

39:10.880 --> 39:14.749
They didn't like my
spaghetti special, for some reason.

39:14.751 --> 39:16.717
Go figure.

39:16.719 --> 39:18.686
Ben, they only wanted
your sandwich.

39:18.688 --> 39:20.088
What did you put in it?

39:20.090 --> 39:20.954
Drugs.

39:20.956 --> 39:22.824
It's not funny.

39:22.826 --> 39:25.959
- It was a joke.
- Still not funny.

39:25.961 --> 39:27.095
The kids are watching TV?

39:27.097 --> 39:28.630
Yeah, they're
watching TV.

39:28.632 --> 39:29.630
You OK?

39:29.632 --> 39:30.865
You come with me.

39:32.902 --> 39:33.901
Hi, sweethearts.

39:33.903 --> 39:35.637
Hi, Mommy!

39:35.639 --> 39:37.704
- Ben is gonna watch some TV with you.
- Yay!

39:37.706 --> 39:41.075
- Mom, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sit down.

39:41.077 --> 39:43.778
<i>...out of a canon
and now we can't find her anywhere.</i>

39:43.780 --> 39:44.813
Come on.

39:44.815 --> 39:46.117
Right in the middle.

39:47.751 --> 39:49.851
Stay.

39:49.853 --> 39:52.586
<i>Everyone grab on to me,
and I'll swing on this tree branch</i>

39:52.588 --> 39:54.125
<i>into the pond!</i>

39:59.695 --> 40:01.464
You fucking monster.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.534
Honey, you OK in there?

40:06.536 --> 40:09.938
Yes, just getting changed.

40:09.940 --> 40:12.443
How'd it go? How's
he... how's he doing?

40:14.677 --> 40:16.543
Great. He's doing great.

40:16.545 --> 40:17.947
How are you doing?

40:18.648 --> 40:21.916
I am doing great.

40:21.918 --> 40:24.117
OK.

40:24.119 --> 40:26.787
Honey, I... I better get ready.

40:26.789 --> 40:27.822
Of course.

40:27.824 --> 40:30.124
You get ready.
I will take care of the chores.

40:30.126 --> 40:30.825
Thank you.

40:35.898 --> 40:37.534
Would you just?

40:43.507 --> 40:44.938
No. No, not those slacks.

40:44.940 --> 40:46.874
The ones from
when you were skinny.

40:46.876 --> 40:48.075
Skinnier.

40:48.077 --> 40:49.077
Ivy?

40:49.079 --> 40:50.412
What?

40:50.414 --> 40:53.184
I need your big safety pins.
There's some in the kitchen.

40:54.717 --> 40:56.918
- It sounded great, by the way.
- Mm-hmm.

40:56.920 --> 40:58.920
Thank you.

40:58.922 --> 41:00.188
I'm feeding Ponce.

41:00.190 --> 41:01.956
Oh, I'm so glad.
Thanks, honey.

41:01.958 --> 41:03.657
- Mom!
- Yes, sweetie.

41:03.659 --> 41:04.858
It itches.

41:04.860 --> 41:06.927
- Where?
- Everywhere!

41:06.929 --> 41:09.930
I wish I'd known that earlier. Mommy
can't do anything about it now.

41:09.932 --> 41:11.932
But it's everywhere.

41:11.934 --> 41:13.668
Well, it's just part
of being a sheep.

41:13.670 --> 41:17.539
Hey, buddy. The thing about
an itch is just don't scratch.

41:17.541 --> 41:19.210
- Um...
- Shh. Ivy!

41:19.943 --> 41:20.941
Thank you.

41:20.943 --> 41:22.809
I beg your pardon.

41:26.849 --> 41:27.949
I'm gonna need a sweater.

41:27.951 --> 41:30.150
OK. Coming right up.

41:30.152 --> 41:32.153
All right, everybody.
Let's get going.

41:32.155 --> 41:34.925
We don't want to be late.

41:35.791 --> 41:37.758
I'm so sorry.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.063
Don't.

42:10.659 --> 42:11.928
Stay put.

42:19.902 --> 42:21.605
I'm so sorry, Beth.

42:22.771 --> 42:24.208
This has gotta hurt.

42:30.746 --> 42:32.248
Maggie was an angel.

42:34.083 --> 42:35.618
We think about her.

42:41.023 --> 42:42.625
Hold on tight.

42:44.293 --> 42:45.628
I am.

43:08.851 --> 43:10.153
What'd she say?

43:12.789 --> 43:14.224
No one blames you.

43:16.126 --> 43:18.358
There were
shepherds out in the field

43:18.360 --> 43:21.162
keeping watch over
their flock by night.

43:21.164 --> 43:23.798
And an angel of the Lord
appeared to them...

43:23.800 --> 43:25.400
Ben. Hi, Ben!

43:25.402 --> 43:28.670
shone around them, and
they were filled with fear,

43:28.672 --> 43:31.271
and the angel said to
them, "Be not afraid.

43:31.273 --> 43:33.675
I bring you good
news of a great joy,

43:33.677 --> 43:35.876
which will come to
all the people.

43:35.878 --> 43:38.146
For to you is born
this day in the city

43:38.148 --> 43:41.349
of David, a savior,
who is Christ the Lord.

43:41.351 --> 43:45.219
You will find a babe
wrapped in swaddling clothes

43:45.221 --> 43:47.391
and lying in a manger.

Hey!

45:23.920 --> 45:26.954
Ivy, by the way, that
was your best singing ever.

45:26.956 --> 45:29.523
I think the
two of you were great.

45:29.525 --> 45:32.193
Yeah, they're completely right.
You were amazing.

45:32.195 --> 45:34.028
- Yeah, you were awesome!
- Really amazing.

45:34.030 --> 45:35.796
- Yes!
- And you, little buddy.

45:35.798 --> 45:37.231
- You think so?
- Yes.

45:37.233 --> 45:38.800
For a second there,
I literally thought

45:38.802 --> 45:39.800
that you were a sheep.

45:40.971 --> 45:43.804
And, and, and you didn't
even have to pretend

45:43.806 --> 45:44.938
because you're an angel.

45:46.342 --> 45:48.141
<i>Front door.</i>

45:51.481 --> 45:53.280
All right, kiddos.

45:53.282 --> 45:55.583
Jammies and teeth
brushed right now, please.

45:55.585 --> 45:59.119
- Start jammin'.
- All right. Come on.

45:59.121 --> 46:00.220
What happened?

46:00.222 --> 46:01.488
Oh, my God.

46:01.490 --> 46:03.157
- OK, kids.
- Stay right here.

46:03.159 --> 46:04.492
- Shh, sit down. Sit down.
- Why?

46:04.494 --> 46:05.592
- Don't move.
- Sit down.

46:05.594 --> 46:07.094
Sit down,
sit down right here.

46:07.096 --> 46:08.429
- Mom.
- Sit down.

46:08.431 --> 46:10.530
It's okay.
It's okay, honey.

46:10.532 --> 46:12.499
There's broken glass.

46:12.501 --> 46:15.302
- Don't be scared. Daddy's just checking...
- Ben.

46:15.304 --> 46:17.271
Be careful.

46:26.114 --> 46:28.249
Come on. Fuck.
Come on.

46:28.251 --> 46:29.816
This can't be
happening. Not again.

46:29.818 --> 46:32.119
Stay right here. Don't move.
It's okay. I know. Don't move.

46:32.121 --> 46:33.856
- I'm scared.
- It's okay. It's okay.

46:36.860 --> 46:38.394
Come on, motherfucker.

46:43.498 --> 46:44.834
What?

46:46.302 --> 46:47.838
I was at church.

46:50.039 --> 46:51.942
Coast is clear.

46:53.242 --> 46:55.041
We still got the TV,

46:55.043 --> 46:56.344
and we got the computers,

46:56.346 --> 47:01.949
and, most importantly,
we got the presents.

47:01.951 --> 47:04.985
Yeah, it was probably
just neighborhood kids.

47:04.987 --> 47:06.287
Just a practical joke.

47:06.289 --> 47:08.054
Neal?

47:08.056 --> 47:09.423
No, no real damage.

47:09.425 --> 47:11.124
That's a relief.

47:11.126 --> 47:12.260
Where's Ponce?

47:12.262 --> 47:13.494
I don't know.

47:13.496 --> 47:15.496
I'm sure he's
here somewhere.

47:15.498 --> 47:17.898
- Mom? Where's Ponce?
- You just checked the whole house.

47:17.900 --> 47:19.900
- Yeah.
- He's probably just hiding.

47:19.902 --> 47:20.802
You didn't see him?

47:20.804 --> 47:23.037
- No.
- I wanna find Ponce.

47:23.039 --> 47:24.505
- You know what? It's way past our bed time.
- Ponce!

47:24.507 --> 47:26.072
- Shh, upstairs.
- But mo-o-om.

47:26.074 --> 47:27.575
Ponce!

47:27.577 --> 47:30.311
- I wanna find Ponce.
- No, shh, upstairs.

47:30.313 --> 47:32.479
Fuck.

47:32.481 --> 47:34.615
Ponce!

47:34.617 --> 47:36.349
Come on, Poncey!

47:36.351 --> 47:38.052
Come on, Poncey!

47:38.054 --> 47:39.186
I bet he just...

47:39.188 --> 47:40.655
you know, went
out exploring.

47:40.657 --> 47:42.356
No, he didn't.

47:42.358 --> 47:46.459
Sweetie, he is just having
a Christmas adventure.

47:46.461 --> 47:47.461
All right?

47:47.463 --> 47:49.296
Come on, boy!

47:49.298 --> 47:50.530
Ponce!

47:50.532 --> 47:52.335
OK, snuggled in.

47:53.469 --> 47:55.436
<i>Front door.</i>

47:55.438 --> 47:58.005
I can't find him anywhere.

47:58.007 --> 47:59.606
And he'd never run off.

47:59.608 --> 48:01.108
Someone took him.

48:02.177 --> 48:04.512
Who would steal our dog?

48:04.514 --> 48:08.218
You come back, and
then this happens?

48:09.619 --> 48:10.988
This is on you.

48:28.438 --> 48:31.671
<i>Front door.</i>

48:31.673 --> 48:33.307
Tomorrow,
when you wake up,

48:33.309 --> 48:34.708
it's gonna be Christmas.

48:34.710 --> 48:37.380
With presents and Ponce.

48:38.246 --> 48:40.347
All right. I love you.

48:40.349 --> 48:42.615
Try to sleep, and I'll
be right back, OK?

48:42.617 --> 48:43.985
Love you.

48:43.987 --> 48:44.985
Leave the light on.

48:44.987 --> 48:46.422
Of course I will.

48:59.668 --> 49:01.135
What are you doing?

49:01.137 --> 49:03.003
You aren't calling
the cops, are you?

49:03.005 --> 49:04.405
I am.

49:04.407 --> 49:07.407
No, Neal.
No cops. Not yet.

49:07.409 --> 49:08.541
Where is he?

49:08.543 --> 49:10.010
Why wasn't
the alarm on?

49:10.012 --> 49:11.412
Because Ben was with us.

49:11.414 --> 49:14.215
He's the reason we got the
alarm in the first place.

49:14.217 --> 49:15.615
Where is he?

49:15.617 --> 49:16.987
He left.

49:23.059 --> 49:24.428
Go.

49:27.697 --> 49:29.032
Holly.

49:31.034 --> 49:32.099
Holly?

49:32.101 --> 49:33.603
<i>Left door.</i>

49:41.177 --> 49:43.579
Jesus. Ben!

49:45.047 --> 49:46.579
Ben!

49:46.581 --> 49:49.650
Every fucking thing
I do turns to shit.

49:49.652 --> 49:51.519
- No, honey...
- No, no matter how

49:51.521 --> 49:53.621
hard I try, everything
just turns to shit.

49:53.623 --> 49:55.188
Please, just get in the car.

49:55.190 --> 49:56.190
I didn't do it.

49:56.192 --> 49:57.590
Obviously.

49:57.592 --> 49:59.325
But I'm... I'm the reason
that somebody did.

49:59.327 --> 50:00.661
I put you in danger.

50:00.663 --> 50:04.097
I put my... I put my
family in danger.

50:04.099 --> 50:05.465
And...

50:05.467 --> 50:07.668
And I should've
known. I'm so stupid.

50:07.670 --> 50:10.507
No, you're not.
Please, get in the car.

50:11.606 --> 50:14.378
Jesus.
Where are you going?

50:15.244 --> 50:16.709
Ben!

50:16.711 --> 50:18.211
Will you stop?

50:18.213 --> 50:19.847
I have to fix it.
I have to fix it.

50:19.849 --> 50:21.215
I gotta find Ponce.

50:21.217 --> 50:22.249
OK, well, just think.

50:22.251 --> 50:23.684
I am. God, damn it.

50:23.686 --> 50:24.751
What?

50:24.753 --> 50:26.454
H-How?

50:26.456 --> 50:27.755
You don't understand.

50:27.757 --> 50:30.092
There are so many people
that it could be.

50:33.362 --> 50:37.798
All right, well, we'll just
take it one asshole at a time.

50:37.800 --> 50:39.803
Well, get in the car.

50:48.244 --> 50:49.546
Seat belt.

51:00.655 --> 51:03.527
No, don't turn here.
Don't turn on Elm.

51:06.128 --> 51:07.394
Not Pleasant.

51:07.396 --> 51:09.699
All right. Just tell
me where to turn.

51:11.199 --> 51:12.266
Tell me where.

51:12.268 --> 51:13.501
- Fuck!
- What?

51:13.503 --> 51:15.672
I've... I've used there.

51:24.713 --> 51:27.183
I robbed someone there. I...

51:41.563 --> 51:42.795
This place?

51:42.797 --> 51:44.430
- Yeah.
- What's here?

51:44.432 --> 51:45.833
You cannot ask, Mom.

51:45.835 --> 51:47.367
If we're...

51:47.369 --> 51:49.637
If we're doing this together,

51:49.639 --> 51:50.670
you cannot ask.

51:50.672 --> 51:52.706
OK, I won't ask.

51:52.708 --> 51:53.840
I'll just... OK.

51:53.842 --> 51:55.511
No. No, Mom.

51:59.548 --> 52:01.182
But I'm not letting
you out of my sight.

52:01.184 --> 52:03.452
You won't have to.
Just stay here.

52:25.541 --> 52:26.843
Well.

52:28.277 --> 52:29.545
It's about time.

52:30.246 --> 52:31.579
Come in.

52:41.923 --> 52:44.594
Did you take...
did you take my dog?

52:57.472 --> 52:58.505
No luck.

52:58.507 --> 53:00.407
Who was that?

53:00.409 --> 53:02.376
Mom, we had a deal.

53:02.378 --> 53:03.646
Let's go.

53:12.487 --> 53:14.487
- I recognize him.
- Mom.

53:14.489 --> 53:15.824
I know I know him.

53:18.527 --> 53:20.630
God, he looks so familiar.

53:21.264 --> 53:22.496
Mr. Richman.

53:22.498 --> 53:23.530
Your history teacher?

53:23.532 --> 53:24.867
Yeah.

53:30.273 --> 53:31.871
His mother had cancer.

53:31.873 --> 53:33.440
Hospice.

53:33.442 --> 53:36.813
He had lots of oxy.
Jars full, and endless supply.

53:39.382 --> 53:40.884
We had an arrangement.

53:46.554 --> 53:48.021
Oh, God.

53:48.023 --> 53:50.423
Oh, my God.

53:52.360 --> 53:53.829
Oh, that piece of shit.

54:17.452 --> 54:19.389
Mom, we gotta
keep going.

54:56.659 --> 54:58.361
I think it's...

55:00.596 --> 55:01.862
What's here?

55:01.864 --> 55:04.067
Maggie's dad lives
in one of these.

55:06.668 --> 55:08.637
Why would he
take Ponce?

55:09.572 --> 55:10.974
Who hates me more?

55:19.148 --> 55:20.450
It's one of these.

55:34.797 --> 55:36.365
That's him.

55:43.672 --> 55:44.974
No Ponce.

55:54.717 --> 55:56.485
Heartbreaking, that.

55:58.420 --> 56:00.554
Sometimes it catches.

56:00.556 --> 56:04.791
- Why don't you let me try?
- I got it.

56:04.793 --> 56:05.992
Just... you're being too
herky-jerky with it.

56:05.994 --> 56:07.427
I'm not being
herky-jerky.

56:07.429 --> 56:08.695
Sweetie, I'm not
criticizing you.

56:08.697 --> 56:10.563
I'm just saying.

56:10.565 --> 56:12.800
- Mom, I know how to...
- I don't... apparently not this exact seatbelt

56:12.802 --> 56:14.635
- you know how to put on.
- Holy...!

56:14.637 --> 56:16.103
- Shit!
- Oh, my God!

56:16.105 --> 56:19.139
What the fuck are
you doing here?

56:19.141 --> 56:21.474
You fucking junkie
piece of shit!

56:21.476 --> 56:22.508
Get the fuck out!

56:22.510 --> 56:23.846
Oh, the fuck?!

56:30.085 --> 56:32.719
We are going to
have to talk about this.

56:32.721 --> 56:34.521
I mean, I get to
ask questions.

56:34.523 --> 56:36.023
I get...

56:36.025 --> 56:38.958
I'm gonna have to explain
the window to Neal.

56:38.960 --> 56:42.729
He tried to bash in
my head, and he should.

56:42.731 --> 56:43.963
Don't say that.

56:43.965 --> 56:45.798
If you were him,
you'd want me dead

56:45.800 --> 56:47.668
for what I did.

56:47.670 --> 56:49.503
All right, well, then you're
going to have to help me here.

56:49.505 --> 56:50.840
What did you do?

57:08.891 --> 57:10.791
Who are we
looking for?

57:10.793 --> 57:12.195
You'll know when I know.

57:15.498 --> 57:16.900
Thank you.

57:27.510 --> 57:28.978
I got Maggie hooked.

57:37.820 --> 57:40.523
I told her how
great it was.

57:42.023 --> 57:44.557
Did you tie her down and
stick a needle in her arm?

57:44.559 --> 57:46.659
- No, but...
- And, at that time,

57:46.661 --> 57:52.065
didn't you think it was
the best thing ever?

57:52.067 --> 57:54.934
Then, you
told her the truth.

57:54.936 --> 57:58.271
At that time,
that was your truth.

57:58.273 --> 57:59.139
But it was wrong.

57:59.141 --> 58:02.642
Didn't you just want
her to be happy?

58:02.644 --> 58:04.978
This... this is so twisted.

58:04.980 --> 58:07.583
Well, what did
you want her to feel?

58:08.817 --> 58:11.050
Do you hear
yourself right now?

58:11.052 --> 58:13.623
What did you want
her to feel?

58:20.795 --> 58:22.064
Safe.

58:24.833 --> 58:26.566
Loved.

58:26.568 --> 58:28.538
Alive. Whole.

58:31.106 --> 58:33.076
Something that nobody...

58:33.943 --> 58:36.175
not even you could ever...

58:36.177 --> 58:37.579
make me feel.

58:42.851 --> 58:44.119
OK.

58:47.789 --> 58:49.858
You know what
you did wrong.

58:51.126 --> 58:53.997
You lived,
and she didn't.

58:55.130 --> 58:56.932
And we'll never know why.

58:58.701 --> 59:00.036
It should've been me.

59:00.735 --> 59:02.004
No.

59:03.771 --> 59:05.671
You ready to order?

59:05.673 --> 59:09.742
Um, yes, I will have
you soup of the day

59:09.744 --> 59:11.047
and a combo, please.

59:16.985 --> 59:18.651
Hi, honey, I was
about to call you.

59:18.653 --> 59:21.324
<i>I'm going out of my mind.
Where are you?</i>

59:22.291 --> 59:24.324
Um, I'm... I'm with Ben.

59:24.326 --> 59:28.095
It took me a while to find
find him, but I did, and, uh,

59:28.097 --> 59:29.996
<i>We're just
getting a bite.</i>

59:29.998 --> 59:32.231
- Daddy.
- We're supposed to be a united front.

59:32.233 --> 59:35.001
We are.
You just have to trust me.

59:35.003 --> 59:36.168
Well, you're making
that very hard.

59:36.170 --> 59:38.005
<i>You need to come home.</i>

59:38.007 --> 59:39.972
Not without Ponce.

59:39.974 --> 59:43.010
Those kids are waking
up with their dog.

59:43.012 --> 59:45.311
And there's no need
for cops because

59:45.313 --> 59:47.380
we've got this,
Ben and I.

59:47.382 --> 59:48.081
Don't we, Ben?

59:48.083 --> 59:49.349
<i>You've got this.</i>

59:49.351 --> 59:51.952
- You and the drug addict. You got this.
- Daddy?

59:51.954 --> 59:53.256
Please...

59:54.322 --> 59:55.856
Baby.

59:55.858 --> 59:57.157
Here's an ideal, Neal.

59:57.159 --> 59:59.793
Why don't you take
care of our kids?

59:59.795 --> 01:00:00.894
And I'll deal with mine.

01:00:00.896 --> 01:00:02.195
Hm?

01:00:02.197 --> 01:00:04.067
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

01:00:05.701 --> 01:00:06.969
Neal.

01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:15.175
What?

01:00:15.177 --> 01:00:16.945
He's a bit of a dick.

01:00:17.278 --> 01:00:18.345
Wow.

01:00:18.347 --> 01:00:19.979
Weren't you just
complaining?

01:00:19.981 --> 01:00:23.182
No, I can think
or say about him

01:00:23.184 --> 01:00:25.952
whatever I want because
he is my husband,

01:00:25.954 --> 01:00:28.155
and I love him,
but you...

01:00:28.157 --> 01:00:30.126
God, you clearly
don't get it.

01:00:30.858 --> 01:00:32.124
You're here,

01:00:32.126 --> 01:00:35.295
and without Neal,
you wouldn't be.

01:00:35.297 --> 01:00:36.829
Mm, don't be so sure.

01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:38.130
How many rehabs
is it now?

01:00:38.132 --> 01:00:39.365
I couldn't've paid for it.

01:00:39.367 --> 01:00:40.967
Insurance won't anymore.

01:00:40.969 --> 01:00:42.702
The government
doesn't give a fuck.

01:00:42.704 --> 01:00:45.171
And, heaven help you
if you're poor,

01:00:45.173 --> 01:00:48.742
which, because of Neal,
we aren't anymore.

01:00:48.744 --> 01:00:53.813
He took out a second mortgage on
the house to pay for you this time.

01:00:53.815 --> 01:00:56.985
The only thing you should
say about Neal is thank you.

01:00:58.286 --> 01:00:59.885
No way, man.

01:00:59.887 --> 01:01:01.153
Go!

01:01:01.155 --> 01:01:03.055
- Relax.
- No, I'm not relaxing. Go.

01:01:03.057 --> 01:01:04.257
I said get out.

01:01:04.259 --> 01:01:05.492
What is it?

01:01:05.494 --> 01:01:06.492
Oh, shit.

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.666
What's going on?

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:29.483
Who'd you tell?

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:30.617
About what?

01:01:30.619 --> 01:01:32.219
- That I'm back.
- Everyone knows you're back.

01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:33.820
'Cause of you.

01:01:33.822 --> 01:01:34.820
Where's my dog?

01:01:34.822 --> 01:01:36.322
Who took my dog?

01:01:36.324 --> 01:01:37.824
Oh, so you can steal other
people's shit all you want?

01:01:37.826 --> 01:01:39.762
But someone steals
yours you get all holy?

01:01:40.762 --> 01:01:43.028
OK, was it Tommy?

01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:44.030
No.

01:01:44.032 --> 01:01:45.030
Was it Bumgarner?

01:01:45.032 --> 01:01:46.099
Jail.

01:01:46.101 --> 01:01:47.369
Was it Clayton?

01:01:55.476 --> 01:01:56.812
Who's that?

01:01:58.347 --> 01:01:59.482
My mom.

01:02:01.016 --> 01:02:02.452
Oh, oh, hey, Mrs. B.

01:02:03.085 --> 01:02:04.353
Long time.

01:02:05.186 --> 01:02:06.952
Spencer?

01:02:06.954 --> 01:02:08.854
I... I go by Spider now, Mrs. B.

01:02:08.856 --> 01:02:10.293
Feels more like me.

01:02:11.293 --> 01:02:12.795
You look terrible.

01:02:14.295 --> 01:02:16.765
You always say it
like it is, Mrs. B.

01:02:19.835 --> 01:02:21.568
Oh, my God.

01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:22.568
I'm sorry, Mrs. B.

01:02:36.585 --> 01:02:38.885
Oh, God, that little shit.

01:02:38.887 --> 01:02:39.885
It's okay.

01:02:39.887 --> 01:02:41.086
Let me just help.

01:02:41.088 --> 01:02:42.491
- It's not helping.
- OK.

01:02:43.391 --> 01:02:45.325
I know who has Ponce.

01:02:45.327 --> 01:02:48.360
- Well, that's great. That's something.
- No, no.

01:02:48.362 --> 01:02:51.099
It's the person I
hoped it wouldn't be.

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:02.111
It's gonna take more.

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:05.412
That's my daily limit.

01:03:05.414 --> 01:03:07.947
I can write a check, but...

01:03:07.949 --> 01:03:10.318
these aren't check
people, are they?

01:03:11.119 --> 01:03:12.387
No.

01:03:16.858 --> 01:03:18.126
Take this.

01:03:20.262 --> 01:03:21.564
It's worth a lot.

01:03:22.864 --> 01:03:24.132
It's just a thing.

01:03:28.103 --> 01:03:29.405
I'm sorry.

01:03:31.639 --> 01:03:33.141
I never liked it.

01:03:41.182 --> 01:03:44.150
Turn your lights off.

01:03:44.152 --> 01:03:45.985
All right. Let's...
You know what?

01:03:45.987 --> 01:03:48.021
Let's just... let's just
turn right around

01:03:48.023 --> 01:03:50.557
because Ponce was a rescue,
and we had a good run.

01:03:50.559 --> 01:03:52.124
You did not
just say that.

01:03:52.126 --> 01:03:53.959
Yes, I did.
Ponce is just a dog.

01:03:53.961 --> 01:03:56.662
I love five people,
and Ponce is two of them.

01:03:56.664 --> 01:03:58.430
OK, well, he is
a pee in the house,

01:03:58.432 --> 01:03:59.499
crap on the carpet dog,

01:03:59.501 --> 01:04:00.967
and you are
so much more.

01:04:00.969 --> 01:04:03.436
Fuck, what are we doing?
This is madness.

01:04:03.438 --> 01:04:05.438
No. No, this is manageable.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.273
It's Clayton.
We go way back.

01:04:07.275 --> 01:04:08.508
I'll pay up,

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:09.575
and maybe we'll
have a good laugh.

01:04:09.577 --> 01:04:11.010
You don't believe that.

01:04:11.012 --> 01:04:12.545
If I don't deal with this,

01:04:12.547 --> 01:04:16.219
then it could be worse next
time for you and the family.

01:04:18.619 --> 01:04:21.554
OK, you go in,
pay the man,

01:04:21.556 --> 01:04:23.423
get Ponce, and get
right back out.

01:04:26.228 --> 01:04:28.228
You're coming out.

01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:29.865
Yeah, I'm coming out.

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:35.338
Be careful.

01:04:39.974 --> 01:04:40.974
Lock the door.

01:04:40.976 --> 01:04:42.311
Lock the door.

01:05:28.523 --> 01:05:30.459
Just be calm.

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:33.726
I can't be calm.

01:05:33.728 --> 01:05:35.063
I'll just go in.

01:06:01.222 --> 01:06:02.488
Mom.

01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:04.057
Mom, what are you doing?

01:06:04.059 --> 01:06:05.057
Oh, my God.

01:06:05.059 --> 01:06:06.492
Get over here.

01:06:06.494 --> 01:06:07.726
What happened?
Where's Ponce?

01:06:07.728 --> 01:06:09.429
All right, I got in,
and I got out.

01:06:09.431 --> 01:06:10.429
And that's the good news.

01:06:10.431 --> 01:06:11.563
What's the bad?

01:06:11.565 --> 01:06:13.233
I just need you
to drive, OK?

01:06:13.235 --> 01:06:14.233
Let me do the thinking.

01:06:14.235 --> 01:06:16.302
OK.

01:06:16.304 --> 01:06:18.007
Oh, Jesus.

01:06:24.346 --> 01:06:25.648
Oh, my God.

01:06:26.748 --> 01:06:28.680
Easy. Easy, Mom.

01:06:28.682 --> 01:06:30.050
You're trying too hard.

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:31.050
OK, of course I am.

01:06:31.052 --> 01:06:33.086
It's what I do.

01:06:33.088 --> 01:06:35.320
Stop. Stop, you're
flooding the engine.

01:06:35.322 --> 01:06:36.322
You've gotta
give it a rest.

01:06:36.324 --> 01:06:37.657
Oh, sorry.

01:06:37.659 --> 01:06:39.659
Clayton doesn't deal
out of here anymore.

01:06:39.661 --> 01:06:42.762
He's gone up the chain,
and he's not happy with me.

01:06:42.764 --> 01:06:43.829
Oh, my God.

01:06:43.831 --> 01:06:46.066
But I got a plan,
so I need you to listen to me.

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:48.200
I can't help but think if
I hadn't left your dad...

01:06:48.202 --> 01:06:49.735
He left us, so just
please listen to me.

01:06:49.737 --> 01:06:51.838
You took it so
hard you blamed yourself.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.738
OK, just stop.

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.273
It was something
that... it changed you.

01:06:54.275 --> 01:06:55.744
Just move... move over.

01:06:59.414 --> 01:07:01.417
A boy needs a dad.

01:07:03.085 --> 01:07:04.249
A boy needs a dad.

01:07:04.251 --> 01:07:05.418
Mom.

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:07.387
No, it... that's
what you needed.

01:07:07.389 --> 01:07:08.691
Not that dad.

01:07:12.226 --> 01:07:13.795
Fuck, we need gas.

01:07:15.697 --> 01:07:17.796
You tried so hard
to keep me happy.

01:07:17.798 --> 01:07:20.766
And what kid wouldn't crack
under the weight of that.

01:07:20.768 --> 01:07:22.070
Mom.

01:07:23.271 --> 01:07:24.336
What?

01:07:24.338 --> 01:07:25.641
What is it?

01:07:40.155 --> 01:07:41.887
You need to go home.

01:07:41.889 --> 01:07:43.123
Not without you.

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:44.389
You cannot go
where I'm going.

01:07:44.391 --> 01:07:45.592
It's not safe.

01:07:45.594 --> 01:07:46.825
Then I'm definitely going.

01:07:46.827 --> 01:07:48.128
No. No.

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:49.262
Go home.

01:07:49.264 --> 01:07:50.329
I'll be there soon.

01:07:50.331 --> 01:07:51.697
No, I don't believe you.

01:07:51.699 --> 01:07:53.833
OK, so now you
don't believe me.

01:07:53.835 --> 01:07:55.267
No, I don't.

01:07:55.269 --> 01:07:57.704
Mom, you don't know
what you're doing.

01:07:57.706 --> 01:08:00.206
- I do.
- You don't know what you're doing.

01:08:00.208 --> 01:08:01.740
I'm not worth it.

01:08:01.742 --> 01:08:03.742
If you really knew me,
you'd be done with me.

01:08:03.744 --> 01:08:04.911
No, honey, I wouldn't.

01:08:04.913 --> 01:08:06.579
- And I know you...
- No.

01:08:06.581 --> 01:08:08.313
- I know you.
- You don't, Mom. You don't know me.

01:08:08.315 --> 01:08:10.150
You don't.

01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:13.686
My sponsor told me
not to come back.

01:08:13.688 --> 01:08:15.621
He said it was
a shit idea.

01:08:15.623 --> 01:08:17.423
That I was not ready.

01:08:17.425 --> 01:08:18.491
That's not true.

01:08:18.493 --> 01:08:19.826
Yes, it is.
It is true.

01:08:19.828 --> 01:08:22.194
And I didn't get the
drugs from the girl.

01:08:22.197 --> 01:08:23.428
They were in the attic

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:26.832
above Liam and
Lacey's room.

01:08:26.835 --> 01:08:28.701
And within an hour
of coming home,

01:08:28.703 --> 01:08:30.473
they were in my pocket.

01:08:33.875 --> 01:08:35.841
I told you not
to believe me,

01:08:35.844 --> 01:08:39.312
and you didn't
fucking listen.

01:08:39.314 --> 01:08:41.747
Do you... I mean, I could...
I could... I could go on.

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.249
Do you want
me to go on?

01:08:43.251 --> 01:08:44.317
There's so much more.

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:45.585
I killed Maggie.

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:47.252
- It's not working.
- I killed Maggie!

01:08:47.255 --> 01:08:48.524
It's not working.

01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:51.857
Please, go home!

01:08:51.859 --> 01:08:54.861
You have to go
home, please.

01:08:54.863 --> 01:08:57.330
Please. I'm not
worth it, please.

01:08:57.332 --> 01:08:58.430
Please, go home.

01:08:58.432 --> 01:09:00.469
I will not leave you.

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:33.636
Get whatever you want.

01:09:41.774 --> 01:09:43.542
Oh, and I know
you are not open,

01:09:43.545 --> 01:09:45.410
so you have
a Merry Christmas!

01:09:45.412 --> 01:09:46.778
You, too.

01:09:46.779 --> 01:09:48.615
Can you get me that
blue drink I really like?

01:09:48.617 --> 01:09:49.917
Yeah.

01:09:51.685 --> 01:09:54.656
Mom, you're the best.

01:10:00.028 --> 01:10:02.965
So, its just these
two and one more.

01:10:06.501 --> 01:10:07.733
Honey, which one is it?

01:10:07.735 --> 01:10:10.573
Because there is more
than one choice.

01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:16.946
Ben?

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.326
<i>Hey, it's Ben.
You know what to do.</i>

01:10:35.697 --> 01:10:38.865
No. No, I don't, Ben.
I don't know what to do.

01:10:38.867 --> 01:10:41.904
Get fucking back
here right now.

01:10:47.007 --> 01:10:48.711
No!

01:11:17.971 --> 01:11:19.274
I'm sorry.

01:11:22.409 --> 01:11:25.010
I... I... I didn't know
where else to go.

01:11:25.012 --> 01:11:26.347
He took my car.

01:11:28.449 --> 01:11:31.653
And he's gone somewhere
and I don't know what to do.

01:11:35.356 --> 01:11:36.759
Come... come in.

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:47.069
I can't tell my husband.
He'll call the cops.

01:11:47.902 --> 01:11:49.434
Someone took our dog,

01:11:49.436 --> 01:11:51.774
and Ben's just out
trying to find our dog.

01:11:52.506 --> 01:11:53.908
Come on, Holly.

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:56.576
He's an addict.

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:58.477
And he's out there.

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:05.754
Stay put.

01:12:25.172 --> 01:12:27.809
Holly, you'll need
to listen closely.

01:12:28.943 --> 01:12:31.544
He has a shelf-life
of 18 to 24 months,

01:12:31.546 --> 01:12:33.513
and it's been over
two years, but...

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:36.715
It should be strong enough
if it's the only kit available.

01:12:36.717 --> 01:12:37.983
I'm such a smug bitch.

01:12:37.985 --> 01:12:40.820
I'd never thought
I'd need this.

01:12:40.822 --> 01:12:43.121
First you pull off
the yellow caps.

01:12:43.123 --> 01:12:45.657
You screw in the
applicator tip.

01:12:45.659 --> 01:12:47.192
You take off this cap,

01:12:47.194 --> 01:12:48.693
and insert it here.

01:12:48.695 --> 01:12:50.996
Half a dose in
each nostril.

01:12:50.998 --> 01:12:53.766
I c... I can't. I don't
know what I'm doing.

01:12:53.768 --> 01:12:55.634
I'd... If you couldn't
save Maggie...

01:12:55.636 --> 01:12:57.005
We can't save them.

01:12:59.606 --> 01:13:02.411
But you'll hate yourself
if you don't try.

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:16.958
Go find him.

01:14:18.185 --> 01:14:20.788
Now's starting to
feel like Christmas.

01:14:23.056 --> 01:14:24.225
Here.

01:14:28.563 --> 01:14:29.931
This is my mom's.

01:14:31.666 --> 01:14:33.034
And it's worth a lot.

01:14:37.805 --> 01:14:40.842
I'm good for the rest,
and I'll make it right.

01:14:44.578 --> 01:14:45.880
Yeah, well...

01:14:47.114 --> 01:14:49.585
It's not just about
the money, Burns.

01:14:51.185 --> 01:14:54.189
I mean, I had big plans
for you. You were my guy.

01:14:55.689 --> 01:14:56.688
I know.

01:15:04.097 --> 01:15:05.630
Look, just give
me my dog back,

01:15:05.632 --> 01:15:08.034
and leave my family
out of this because

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:09.735
they didn't do anything.

01:15:09.737 --> 01:15:11.736
I wish it were that easy.

01:15:11.738 --> 01:15:12.838
It can be.

01:15:18.112 --> 01:15:20.148
Fuck it. It's Christmas, right?

01:15:24.018 --> 01:15:25.351
All right. Come on.

01:15:25.353 --> 01:15:26.855
Take this.

01:15:28.989 --> 01:15:32.960
All I need is for you to do
me just one more little favor.

01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:37.599
What's that?

01:16:04.658 --> 01:16:06.692
Merry Christmas.
How can I help you?

01:16:06.694 --> 01:16:10.164
So, I have this, and it's expired.
I need it replaced.

01:16:20.007 --> 01:16:21.976
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:24.744
Ma'am.

01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:27.013
We don't carry this.

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:28.947
What do you mean
you don't carry it?

01:16:28.949 --> 01:16:30.316
You need to try
another pharmacy.

01:16:30.318 --> 01:16:31.983
No, you're the
only one open.

01:16:31.985 --> 01:16:33.753
What do you mean
you don't carry it?

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:38.257
It's our policy not to encourage
irresponsible behavior.

01:16:38.259 --> 01:16:41.326
All right, well, then why don't
you discontinue the oxys,

01:16:41.328 --> 01:16:44.830
the perk 30s, and the...
the... the benzo cheerios

01:16:44.832 --> 01:16:46.165
or whatever you call them.

01:16:46.167 --> 01:16:47.799
If you'd like to file a
complaint, there is a...

01:16:47.801 --> 01:16:49.670
I'm fucking filing one!

01:16:52.073 --> 01:16:53.339
God, fucking damn it.

01:17:25.038 --> 01:17:29.043
Yo. Yo, yo, yo.

01:18:08.882 --> 01:18:10.284
Spare some change?

01:18:20.161 --> 01:18:23.262
Mrs. B. Mrs. B, I'm... I'm...
I'm... I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:18:23.264 --> 01:18:26.268
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I-I-I'm t-too sick.

01:18:27.167 --> 01:18:29.134
Spencer.

01:18:29.136 --> 01:18:30.438
Get in the car.

01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:38.110
Where is he?

01:18:38.112 --> 01:18:40.278
I'm sorry, Mrs. B.
I-I-I'm not...

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:43.182
I'm not doing
my best thinking.

01:18:43.184 --> 01:18:45.151
I need... I need to get well.

01:18:45.153 --> 01:18:46.418
You mean get high.

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:49.321
Fuck, there's
no high anymore.

01:18:49.323 --> 01:18:52.825
I just don't want...
I just don't wanna be sick.

01:18:52.827 --> 01:18:54.393
Help me. H-Help me.

01:18:54.395 --> 01:18:57.428
I just... I just... I just need
a little... a little money.

01:18:57.430 --> 01:19:01.135
OK, I will help you,
but you have to help me.

01:19:02.069 --> 01:19:03.369
Where can I find him?

01:19:03.371 --> 01:19:05.273
He used to run for Clayton.

01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:09.407
You don't... you don't
leave Clayton.

01:19:09.409 --> 01:19:10.843
That's where Ben went.

01:19:10.845 --> 01:19:12.210
Shit.

01:19:12.212 --> 01:19:14.345
- I j... I just snitched.
- No, I-I-I...

01:19:14.347 --> 01:19:16.982
I need more. Tell me
everything you know.

01:19:16.984 --> 01:19:18.286
I can't.

01:19:27.228 --> 01:19:28.529
You can.

01:19:32.065 --> 01:19:34.235
- Where is he?
- OK.

01:19:35.368 --> 01:19:38.773
Go to the pawn shop
across the bridge.

01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:42.875
It's in Yonkers.
Ask around.

01:19:42.877 --> 01:19:45.376
And that's all I could... I
could tell you Mrs. B.

01:19:45.378 --> 01:19:47.278
Anything else,
and they'll kill me.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.447
OK?

01:19:49.449 --> 01:19:51.920
You said you'd
help me get well.

01:19:54.622 --> 01:19:56.988
Your mother and
I were friends

01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:58.389
when you and
Ben were babies.

01:19:58.391 --> 01:19:59.858
I changed your diaper.

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:01.125
This is so fucked.

01:20:01.127 --> 01:20:02.961
Yeah, Mrs. B. It is.

01:20:02.963 --> 01:20:06.434
Call you mother, and tell
her that you're not dead.

01:20:27.255 --> 01:20:28.419
Honey, are you OK?

01:20:28.421 --> 01:20:30.555
Just... Just tell
me you're OK.

01:20:30.557 --> 01:20:32.491
You need to be calm.

01:20:32.493 --> 01:20:35.894
<i>I'm calm. Are you OK?</i>

01:20:35.896 --> 01:20:37.465
Yup, we are on it.

01:20:38.298 --> 01:20:39.898
Just totally safe,

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:42.000
and closing in.

01:20:42.002 --> 01:20:43.035
OK. OK.

01:20:43.037 --> 01:20:44.436
Is that my mom?

01:20:44.438 --> 01:20:46.437
Where are you? Because
I'm coming to get you.

01:20:46.439 --> 01:20:48.040
No, Neal.

01:20:48.042 --> 01:20:49.540
- Is that my mom?
- OK. Yes, it is.

01:20:49.542 --> 01:20:51.543
<i>Can I please
talk to her?</i>

01:20:51.545 --> 01:20:53.614
Yes, you may.
Hold on one second.

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:56.851
Mommy?

01:21:07.261 --> 01:21:08.593
You need to be in bed.

01:21:08.595 --> 01:21:10.428
Ben and I have this
this under control,

01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:13.065
and we will see you
in the morning.

01:21:13.067 --> 01:21:15.166
Why are you lying?

01:21:15.168 --> 01:21:17.169
<i>I'm not.</i>

01:21:17.171 --> 01:21:22.074
Mom, I'm the one who set up
the phones for everybody.

01:21:22.076 --> 01:21:23.575
You're not with Ben.

01:21:23.577 --> 01:21:25.477
Ben is in a whole
other town.

01:21:25.479 --> 01:21:28.080
<i>And I've been calling
you and texting you</i>

01:21:28.082 --> 01:21:29.714
<i>and you won't pick up.</i>

01:21:29.716 --> 01:21:32.418
And I didn't tell Neal
because he'll call the cops,

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:36.324
but now I'm freaking out
because you lied to me.

01:21:37.358 --> 01:21:40.362
We split up to cover
more ground.

01:21:42.095 --> 01:21:43.361
I don't believe you.

01:21:43.363 --> 01:21:44.696
Ivy?

01:21:44.698 --> 01:21:47.398
What am I... what am
I supposed to do?

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:48.567
All right, sweetheart.

01:21:48.569 --> 01:21:50.335
You need to be
calm and hang up.

01:21:50.337 --> 01:21:51.602
Deal with Neal.

01:21:51.604 --> 01:21:53.237
<i>Call me back as
soon as you can</i>

01:21:53.239 --> 01:21:54.373
<i>from your own phone.</i>

01:21:54.375 --> 01:21:56.308
<i>All right?</i>

01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:57.308
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:59.210
Ivy?

01:21:59.212 --> 01:22:00.514
OK.

01:22:34.715 --> 01:22:35.714
Hi, honey.

01:22:35.716 --> 01:22:37.415
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

01:22:37.417 --> 01:22:39.684
OK, I want you to help me
find your brother, yeah?

01:22:39.686 --> 01:22:43.324
Keep going, and, um, if
you turn left on Millwood.

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.396
<i>Keep going straight...</i>

01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:51.295
and turn right
on 23rd street.

01:22:51.297 --> 01:22:52.430
<i>Do you see that?</i>

01:22:52.432 --> 01:22:54.970
This is 23rd street,
right? OK.

01:22:57.304 --> 01:22:59.037
OK, and, um...

01:22:59.039 --> 01:23:01.443
<i>just keep going
straight for a bit.</i>

01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:06.144
You're doing great, Ivy.

01:23:06.146 --> 01:23:07.681
You're getting really close.

01:23:10.451 --> 01:23:12.284
<i>OK, turn before
the intersection.</i>

01:23:12.286 --> 01:23:13.755
<i>Mom, turn now.</i>

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:24.065
<i>You're really close.
Do you see him?</i>

01:23:26.766 --> 01:23:28.135
<i>Mom?</i>

01:23:29.569 --> 01:23:31.605
He should be right there.

01:23:33.707 --> 01:23:35.206
<i>I'm gonna call his phone.</i>

01:23:35.208 --> 01:23:36.744
OK, good idea.

01:23:41.347 --> 01:23:42.649
<i>OK, it's ringing.</i>

01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:48.519
<i>Do you hear it?</i>

01:23:51.158 --> 01:23:53.224
I'll call you right back.

01:23:53.226 --> 01:23:54.226
Don't hang up.

01:23:54.228 --> 01:23:56.030
No. Mom?

01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:19.218
<i>I got him.</i>

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.852
OK, God.

01:24:20.854 --> 01:24:22.854
So, so, so, we're
good, sweetie.

01:24:22.856 --> 01:24:25.389
<i>Can I just talk to
him really quick?</i>

01:24:25.391 --> 01:24:26.758
We gotta keep moving.

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:30.398
We're going to be home
so soon with Ponce.

01:24:31.231 --> 01:24:32.397
Let me talk to Ben.

01:24:32.399 --> 01:24:34.398
<i>No, we gotta keep
moving, honey.</i>

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.834
No, Mom.

01:24:35.836 --> 01:24:39.606
Sweetie, listen, I just... I
need you to go to sleep.

01:24:40.807 --> 01:24:42.708
I can tell there's
something wrong.

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:45.680
<i>Everything's going to
be OK. Just trust me.</i>

01:24:46.479 --> 01:24:47.912
<i>Mom.</i>

01:24:47.914 --> 01:24:49.149
OK, sweetie.

01:24:50.484 --> 01:24:51.820
OK, I'll see you.

01:25:08.536 --> 01:25:09.837
Excuse me.

01:25:11.771 --> 01:25:13.108
Excuse me.

01:25:14.274 --> 01:25:15.676
I'm looking for my son.

01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:19.847
His name is Ben.
I know he was just here.

01:25:24.284 --> 01:25:25.686
Over by the river.

01:25:27.488 --> 01:25:29.457
That's where
they all end up.

01:25:49.777 --> 01:25:51.578
Hey! Get up!

01:26:22.309 --> 01:26:23.645
Ben?

01:26:25.979 --> 01:26:27.314
Ben.

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:55.877
Mmm, you did good.

01:26:56.743 --> 01:26:59.311
Hey, he did good, right?

01:26:59.313 --> 01:27:01.682
You made a lot of
people happy today.

01:27:06.287 --> 01:27:07.718
For all your hard work.

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.756
Just give me my dog, man.

01:27:56.904 --> 01:27:57.902
Holly.

01:27:57.904 --> 01:27:59.437
Holly?

01:27:59.439 --> 01:28:00.807
<i>I lost him.</i>

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:03.741
What?

01:28:03.743 --> 01:28:06.678
I didn't want to
tell you I've been...

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:07.882
lying to you.

01:28:11.051 --> 01:28:14.322
I've looked everywhere,
and I-I-I can't find him.

01:28:16.657 --> 01:28:18.293
But I tried.

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:24.396
I know you did.

01:28:24.398 --> 01:28:26.934
<i>I lost him a long
time ago. I just...</i>

01:28:28.502 --> 01:28:32.970
I don't know where to
look, and I'm so tired.

01:28:32.972 --> 01:28:36.007
And I don't know
what to do.

01:28:36.009 --> 01:28:39.044
<i>Tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.</i>

01:28:39.046 --> 01:28:41.015
And we'll find
him together.

01:28:44.650 --> 01:28:47.654
No, I'm co... I'm
coming home.

01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:52.092
<i>I'm just gonna
come home.</i>

01:29:03.936 --> 01:29:06.873
Hey, boy. Hey, boy.

01:30:33.159 --> 01:30:34.895
Anything else?

01:31:07.793 --> 01:31:09.063
Here, bud.

01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:05.016
Excuse me.

01:32:05.018 --> 01:32:06.250
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I need help, please.

01:32:06.252 --> 01:32:08.620
Ma'am, need to
wait your turn.

01:32:08.622 --> 01:32:10.988
No, I can't... I can't wait my turn because
my son, who's... he's not a bad kid.

01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:13.924
No, no, no, no, I can't. There's
not time for that right now.

01:32:13.926 --> 01:32:14.925
He stole my car.

01:32:14.927 --> 01:32:15.994
Please.

01:32:15.996 --> 01:32:17.262
Excuse me, sir.

01:32:17.264 --> 01:32:18.897
Ma'am, hold on a second.

01:32:18.899 --> 01:32:20.898
- Can you find...?
- Hello. Hold on one second.

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:22.200
Ma'am, standing there

01:32:22.202 --> 01:32:24.335
- won't help you...
- I just need you to

01:32:24.337 --> 01:32:27.606
please find my son
and arrest him!

01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:29.610
I'm begging you!

01:32:30.877 --> 01:32:32.680
[Ponce barking

01:32:40.686 --> 01:32:44.054
If you just wanna calm down and
have a seat, I'll start the form.

01:32:44.056 --> 01:32:45.190
Thank you.
I'm sorry.

01:32:59.905 --> 01:33:01.242
Hello?

01:33:47.119 --> 01:33:49.356
Good boy.
Good boy.

01:33:50.356 --> 01:33:52.025
Oh, my God.

01:33:52.426 --> 01:33:53.761
Honey?

01:33:54.961 --> 01:33:56.760
Wake up, Ben.

01:33:56.762 --> 01:33:57.861
Wake up, honey.

01:33:57.863 --> 01:33:59.165
Come on.

01:34:01.935 --> 01:34:02.933
OK.

01:34:02.935 --> 01:34:04.201
All right.

01:34:04.203 --> 01:34:05.706
We've got this. OK.

01:34:06.872 --> 01:34:08.208
All right.

01:34:12.445 --> 01:34:14.144
Come on.

01:34:14.146 --> 01:34:15.813
Come on. Hang in there.

01:34:15.815 --> 01:34:16.981
Come back to me.

01:34:16.983 --> 01:34:18.252
Come on.

01:34:18.851 --> 01:34:20.121
Fuck.

01:34:23.122 --> 01:34:24.658
Just stay with me.

01:34:27.327 --> 01:34:29.727
OK. OK.

01:34:29.729 --> 01:34:31.698
OK. Ready?

01:34:36.737 --> 01:34:37.768
OK.

01:34:37.770 --> 01:34:38.836
Wake up.

Wake up.

Oh, my boy.
Please.

Please. I know
you can do this.
