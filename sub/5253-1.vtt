T, I am 137th!

- [all gasp]

00:10.479 --> 00:12.813
- Matty, I didn't get into SCU.
- I'm sorry.

00:12.814 --> 00:14.849
- It's Matty.
- I know who you are, McKibben.

00:14.850 --> 00:17.551
Gabby may have been Matty's
best girlfriend ever,

00:17.552 --> 00:20.254
but I was determined to
be his best friend ever.

00:20.255 --> 00:22.056
She wasn't trying to intimidate me.

00:22.057 --> 00:23.391
She was just straight-up cool.

00:23.392 --> 00:25.140
She just wants to take
things a little slow.

00:25.141 --> 00:26.928
Some things are just worth waiting for.

00:26.929 --> 00:30.264
Don't spend the rest of
your time in high school

00:31.233 --> 00:32.466
It's okay, Officer,

00:32.467 --> 00:35.336
my sister just got into college!

00:35.337 --> 00:37.041
(Jenna) Brian and I
were about the same age,

00:37.042 --> 00:38.973
but he seemed so much older.

00:38.974 --> 00:40.641
- Well, hello, T.
- Hi.

00:40.642 --> 00:42.410
You think you're gonna see him again?

00:42.411 --> 00:43.844
We're engaged.

00:43.845 --> 00:45.546
We went and saw my biological father.

00:45.547 --> 00:48.349
What you got here, soul mate.

00:48.350 --> 00:49.750
Where's Matty?

00:49.751 --> 00:51.619
I think something his
father said got him riled up.

00:51.620 --> 00:54.422
He just doesn't want to talk to me.

00:54.423 --> 00:56.857
Let her move on with her life.

00:56.858 --> 00:58.092
You had your chance.

If you still have feelings for Jenna,

00:59.361 --> 01:00.294
you know, maybe you should...

01:08.447 --> 01:10.214
Thank God I had finally gotten into college

01:10.215 --> 01:11.749
and gotten over Matty.

01:11.750 --> 01:14.619
Well, I could still look, couldn't I?

01:14.620 --> 01:16.053
But I'd moved on.

01:16.054 --> 01:18.356

My fiancé is the only one

But you're gonna break
off the engagement, right?

Duh and duh-er, Jenna.

Exactly, Lissa.

I really feel her journey now.

01:54.646 --> 01:56.880
In fact, some of this

08:14.358 --> 08:16.760
I think the first thing
that you need to get clear

08:16.761 --> 08:18.061
in your head is,

08:18.062 --> 08:19.496
what do you want from Matty?

08:19.497 --> 08:21.364
I don't want anything from Matty.

08:21.365 --> 08:23.567
- Are you sure?
- Yes, absolutely.

08:23.568 --> 08:25.735
Because if you tell him
that his girlfriend cheated,

08:25.736 --> 08:27.437
then he may think you have an agenda.

08:27.438 --> 08:29.739
He's my friend. I don't
want him to get hurt.

08:29.740 --> 08:31.341
Remember what happened
when you tried telling him

08:31.342 --> 08:33.176
about that whole crazy Eva mess?

08:33.177 --> 08:35.477
Yeah, the messenger got shot.

08:35.479 --> 08:36.712
Exactly.

08:36.714 --> 08:40.683
Sometimes doing nothing is the right thing.

08:40.684 --> 08:42.686
Yeah, for me, but what about for Matty?

08:42.687 --> 08:44.421
- Is Gabby still cheating?
- No!

08:44.422 --> 08:46.356
But she's acting like
she's really into Matty.

08:46.357 --> 08:48.291
Maybe she is still into Matty,

08:48.292 --> 08:52.929
and maybe what he doesn't
know won't hurt him.

08:52.930 --> 08:55.432
Yeah. Leave well enough alone.

08:55.433 --> 08:57.267
I mean, here I am, I finally
got my [bleep] together,

08:57.268 --> 08:59.102
I've got a great guy who's into me,

08:59.103 --> 09:01.671
and I'm about to graduate.

09:01.672 --> 09:04.174
Now is not the time to
stir up the Matty drama.

09:04.175 --> 09:05.842
I think that's right.

09:05.843 --> 09:09.846
Now, how are we gonna deal with
this suspension, young lady?

09:09.847 --> 09:12.682
Shopping or spa day? Or both?

09:12.683 --> 09:13.749
[both chuckle]

09:14.720 --> 09:16.287
(Jenna) I decided to avoid my problems

09:16.288 --> 09:17.822
and focus on my friends' problems.

09:17.823 --> 09:20.117
So you told Adam yet?

09:20.118 --> 09:22.519
I've decided I can't just
back the dump truck up

09:22.520 --> 09:23.921
and unload over the phone.

09:23.922 --> 09:26.223
BTE'ing is a big deal...
breaking the engagement.

09:26.224 --> 09:29.493
So you're really gonna make
him drive all the way out here?

09:29.494 --> 09:31.261
It's a long, hot drive.

09:31.262 --> 09:32.629
F2F is better.

09:32.630 --> 09:34.832
An engagement is a big deal.

09:34.833 --> 09:37.635
Chill, why are you so hung up on something

09:37.636 --> 09:39.169
that really isn't even your business?

09:39.170 --> 09:40.370
(Jenna) Tamara was right.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.039
It really wasn't my business.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.608
Maybe I was pushing her so hard
because I was feeling guilty

09:44.609 --> 09:46.576
about not telling Matty my secret.

09:46.577 --> 09:48.845
But I knew letting it go
was the right thing to do.

09:48.846 --> 09:50.681
Too bad that was easier said than done.

09:50.682 --> 09:52.616
This isn't like regular
high school breaking up.

09:52.617 --> 09:55.052
Yeah, it's such a big deal
that you got engaged to him

09:55.053 --> 09:56.753
after knowing him for all of two hours.

09:56.754 --> 09:58.755
You'll understand if you ever get engaged.

09:58.756 --> 10:00.524
Don't worry, I'm sure you will.

10:00.525 --> 10:02.326
Maybe your Mommy will buy you a pony!

10:02.327 --> 10:03.894
I didn't ride ponies, Lissa.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.996
I competed in dressage on thoroughbreds.

10:05.997 --> 10:09.299
And I am not accepting any
beasts from that monster.

10:09.300 --> 10:12.169
[scoffs] Oh, Sadie,
everyone loves their mommy.

10:12.170 --> 10:13.637
I mean, I was mad at my mommy

10:13.638 --> 10:15.331
when she told me I was
going straight to hell,

10:15.332 --> 10:17.207
but now I just know it was
because she was stressed

10:17.208 --> 10:19.977
about me being in love with my
brother and my daddy being gay.

10:19.978 --> 10:21.144
Look around, Lissa.

10:21.145 --> 10:22.346
We're already in hell.

10:22.347 --> 10:23.747
There is no bigger punishment

10:23.748 --> 10:25.767
than these stupid, desperate pranks.

10:25.768 --> 10:28.051
[high-pitched] Who threw
all this trash on the ground?

10:28.052 --> 10:29.519
It's sick.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.488
[high-pitched] Is this a
prank or a human tapestry

10:31.489 --> 10:33.323
illustrating the tragedy of basic?

10:33.324 --> 10:34.925
It's performance fart.

10:34.926 --> 10:37.761
The evil of banality.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.563
I hope this was a coincidence.

10:39.564 --> 10:41.298
I was here first.

10:41.299 --> 10:43.066
So what happened to
letting Matty down easy?

10:43.067 --> 10:44.601
Not really your concern.

10:44.602 --> 10:45.969
I know we're not getting together,

10:45.970 --> 10:48.038
but you don't have to string Matty along

10:48.039 --> 10:49.039
just to cover our tracks.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.273
It's not that, Jake.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.341
He's really trying now.

10:51.342 --> 10:54.044
He's being so sweet.

10:54.045 --> 10:55.379
Oh, hi.

10:55.380 --> 10:57.481

about me, right, "sweet"?

11:08.860 --> 11:13.463
Wow, what school spirit
and pride, seniors, huzzah!

11:13.464 --> 11:16.500
Okay, this sucked.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.368
We'll figure something out, babe.

11:18.369 --> 11:19.669
It ain't over till it's over.

11:19.670 --> 11:21.605
I know we will. Seniors rule.

11:23.574 --> 11:26.676

11:26.677 --> 11:28.812
(Jenna) Clearly I had
made the right decision.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.181
Matty and Gabby were all over each other.

11:31.182 --> 11:33.016
What he didn't know couldn't hurt him.

11:33.017 --> 11:34.951
Or me.

11:34.952 --> 11:36.586
Okay, new prank tonight.

11:36.587 --> 11:38.989
It's parent-teacher night,
so the timing is perfect.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.091
You show up at 9:00 with lots of underwear.

11:41.092 --> 11:42.859
The trashier the better,
like those red lace ones

11:42.860 --> 11:44.394
you have... can you bring those?

11:44.395 --> 11:46.696
Um, I'm afraid to ask what you're planning,

11:46.697 --> 11:48.065
but I can't make it anyway.

11:48.066 --> 11:49.134
Oh, come on, why not?

11:49.135 --> 11:51.902
(Jenna) I was worried I was failing
him as a friend in so many ways

11:51.903 --> 11:54.304
that I felt extra guilty when I told him...

11:54.305 --> 11:56.139
- I have a date.
- Me too. Sorry.

11:56.140 --> 11:57.707
Come on, you guys.

11:57.708 --> 11:59.042
Where's your class spirit?

11:59.043 --> 12:01.011
Jenna, you did mess up the first prank,

12:01.012 --> 12:03.180
and sadly, the second
one sucked giant balls.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.881
I'm sorry, I just can't tonight.

12:04.882 --> 12:06.450
Wow, you're just done
with high school, huh?

12:06.451 --> 12:07.584
Done with your high school friends

12:07.585 --> 12:09.719
and your old pal Matty McKibben?

12:09.720 --> 12:12.556
All right, all right. I
will try to come by later.

12:12.557 --> 12:13.757
Don't just try.

12:13.758 --> 12:14.925
This is our one and only senior year,

12:14.926 --> 12:18.093
and you quitters are missing out.

12:20.697 --> 12:23.266
I mean, who the hell
does Darlene think she is,

12:23.267 --> 12:25.802
acting like she can just
waltz back into my life

12:25.803 --> 12:27.104
after dumping me on that slag heap Ally?

12:27.105 --> 12:28.338
Your mother?

12:28.339 --> 12:30.474
Darlene is a mother in name only.

12:30.475 --> 12:31.708
It's a cosmic joke that someone

12:31.709 --> 12:33.877
as sensitive and empathetic as me

12:33.878 --> 12:37.180
was birthed from the loins
of that grotesque gold-digger.

12:37.181 --> 12:38.882
What if she really has changed?

12:38.883 --> 12:41.384
Wasn't she getting all spiritual
and self-realized in Santa Fe?

12:41.385 --> 12:43.787
The only self-realization
she needs is to face the fact

12:43.788 --> 12:45.689
that she's an utter
failure as a human being.

12:45.690 --> 12:47.657
She abandoned me when my dad went to jail.

12:47.658 --> 12:49.292
It's always about her.

12:49.293 --> 12:53.363
She's never, not once, made
me feel good about myself.

12:53.364 --> 12:54.965
That's what I'm here for.

12:54.966 --> 12:57.734
Don't go crazy, you are
just my hot piece of ass.

13:00.972 --> 13:02.772
What about just trying to forgive her

13:02.773 --> 13:04.040
and accept her for who she is?

13:04.041 --> 13:05.609
For your sake, not hers.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.245
Forgiveness is weak, and
acceptance is even worse.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.680
It's a slippery slope from
acceptance to complacency,

13:10.681 --> 13:12.883
and I am not a fan of complacency

13:12.884 --> 13:15.152
because it leads to stupidity and obesity.

You're welcome.

13:18.322 --> 13:20.257
I just want you to be happy.

13:20.258 --> 13:23.059

don't want her in my life.
