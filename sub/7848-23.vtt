WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:05.900
OK. WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO FOR YOUR SCHOOL
COMMUNITY SERVICE?

00:05.900 --> 00:08.233
I THOUGHT
I'D SEE A MOVIE.

00:08.667 --> 00:12.400
THEN I'LL TELL
POOR PEOPLE ABOUT IT.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.367
ZACK!

00:13.367 --> 00:16.700
THIS IS A CHANCE FOR US
TO REALLY HELP PEOPLE.

00:16.700 --> 00:20.133
I'M THINKING ABOUT
WORKING WITH KIDS.

00:20.133 --> 00:22.600
I HATE KIDS.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.934
HEY, YOU BETTER
TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY,

00:23.934 --> 00:26.200
OR YOU'RE GONNA FAIL
WHILE I GET AN "A."

00:26.200 --> 00:30.200
YOU'RE ONE
OF THE KIDS I HATE.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.200
I KNOW!

00:31.200 --> 00:33.600
WE SHOULD FEED
THE HUNGRY!

00:33.600 --> 00:34.867
GOOD IDEA.

00:34.867 --> 00:37.100
LET'S START WITH ME.

00:37.367 --> 00:38.200
Man: ...AND WITH
THIS METHOD,

00:38.200 --> 00:41.200
I HAVE HELPED MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE!

00:41.200 --> 00:44.600
IF YOU CAN CONCEIVE,
YOU CAN BELIEVE...

00:44.600 --> 00:48.500
THIS GUY JUST TALKS
AND TALKS AND--

00:48.500 --> 00:50.400
IT'S A LECTURE.

00:51.367 --> 00:53.200
THIS IS AMAZING.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.200
IS IT EVER.

00:54.200 --> 00:56.300
I JUST ATE 5 POUNDS
OF MINI QUICHES,

00:56.300 --> 00:58.400
AND I HAVEN'T
THROWN UP YET.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.734
UH-OH.

01:01.233 --> 01:04.000
I'M OK. IT PASSED.

LOVE THAT!

01:51.934 --> 01:54.233
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
GIVE US A SNOBBY LOOK.

01:54.233 --> 01:56.767
WELL, I HAVE ABOUT
20 DIFFERENT ONES.

01:56.767 --> 01:59.200
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU LIKE?

01:59.200 --> 02:00.200
ONE THAT SAYS,

02:00.200 --> 02:02.033
"ONLY I CAN AFFORD
THESE CLOTHES."

02:02.033 --> 02:05.700
OOH! NUMBER 7.
ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.667
SHE GIVES ME THAT LOOK
3 TIMES A DAY.

02:09.667 --> 02:13.200
I GET THAT LOOK
FROM HER DOG.

02:14.033 --> 02:15.200
AND THAT IS A WRAP.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.200
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
IT'S A REALLY SPARKLY SCARF.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.000
[BOTH LAUGH]

02:20.000 --> 02:22.033
I LOVE FASHION HUMOR.

02:22.867 --> 02:23.500
SO, WHEN WILL I KNOW

02:23.500 --> 02:25.867
IF I'M <i>TEEN TREND'S  </i>
TRENDY TEEN OF THE YEAR?

02:25.867 --> 02:27.700
WELL, WE'RE GOING
TO BE REVIEWING

02:27.700 --> 02:29.000
ALL THE FINALISTS
NEXT WEEK

02:29.000 --> 02:31.834
AND MAKE OUR DECISIONS
ON THE COVER THEN.

02:31.834 --> 02:34.200
WHEN YOU BREAK
THE BAD NEWS TO THE OTHERS,

02:34.200 --> 02:35.200
CAN I WATCH?

02:35.200 --> 02:37.400
[BOTH LAUGH]

02:37.867 --> 02:39.100
OH, CANDY-COUNTER GIRL,

02:39.100 --> 02:43.200
WHY IS <i>TEEN TREND </i>NOT
DISPLAYED IN THE FRONT?

02:43.200 --> 02:45.033
BECAUSE MOST TEENAGERS
CAN'T AFFORD

02:45.033 --> 02:46.200
TO STAY AT A 4-STAR HOTEL.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.200
THEY ALSO CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY
THE CLOTHES IN YOUR MAGAZINE.

02:49.200 --> 02:53.700
WELL, IT IS VERY HARD
TO MAKE CHEAP LOOK NICE.

02:53.700 --> 02:56.934
ALTHOUGH YOU
SEEM TO BE DOING
A RATHER GOOD JOB OF IT.

02:56.934 --> 02:59.000
WHAT DO YOU CALL
THAT LOOK?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.400
MY UNIFORM...

03:01.400 --> 03:03.567
WITH A PERSONAL TOUCH
OF MADDIE.

03:03.567 --> 03:04.834
ACTUALLY,
IT'S MY DAD'S TIE,

03:04.834 --> 03:07.133
SO IT'S A PERSONAL TOUCH
OF IRVING.

03:07.133 --> 03:09.667
CATCHY,
BUT A LITTLE LONG.

03:09.667 --> 03:12.600
I'D CALL IT
BLUE-COLLAR CHIC.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.500
THAT WAS MY SECOND CHOICE.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.700
YOU KNOW, WE HAD NARROWED
DOWN THE FINALISTS,

03:16.700 --> 03:19.500
BUT YOU HAVE
A CERTAIN SOMETHING.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.000
MAYBE WE'LL CONSIDER YOU
FOR THE COVER.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.200
REALLY? ME?

03:23.200 --> 03:26.767
GET A SHOT
OF CANDY-COUNTER GIRL
HERE.

03:26.767 --> 03:27.867
UH, I'M NOT
THE MODEL TYPE.

03:27.867 --> 03:28.734
I MEAN,
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY--

03:28.734 --> 03:31.500
SAY <i>"TEEN TREND'S  </i>
TRENDY TEEN OF THE YEAR."

03:31.500 --> 03:35.500
TEEN TREEN TREN--UH,
CAN I JUST SMILE?

03:35.500 --> 03:37.400
OK.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.467
IF YOU CAN CONCEIVE,

03:45.467 --> 03:46.567
YOU CAN BELIEVE,

03:46.567 --> 03:48.400
AND THEN <i>YOU </i>

03:48.400 --> 03:49.400
CAN ACHIEVE!

03:49.400 --> 03:51.033
I CAN ACHIEVE.

03:51.033 --> 03:53.233
AND I STILL
MIGHT HEAVE.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.400
REMEMBER, LIVE YOUR DREAM

03:56.400 --> 03:57.467
AND AIM FOR THE SKY,

03:57.467 --> 04:03.033
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE PILOT
OF YOUR OWN LIFE.

04:05.500 --> 04:10.100
WOW! THIS GUY HAS REALLY
OPENED MY EYES.

04:10.100 --> 04:13.734
AND APPARENTLY
CLOSED YOURS.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.033
AH, I SEE YOUR BROTHER
HAS LEFT NO LEFTOVERS

04:18.033 --> 04:19.600
FOR MY PET CHICKEN
DUDLEY,

04:19.600 --> 04:21.667
WHO, BY THE WAY,
LOVES MINI QUICHES.

04:21.667 --> 04:24.000
ESTEBAN, WHAT WAS
YOUR BIGGEST DREAM

04:24.000 --> 04:25.200
WHEN YOU CAME
TO THIS COUNTRY?

04:25.200 --> 04:28.567
OH, I WAS HOPING
TO BE A MILLIONAIRE
BASEBALL PLAYER,

04:28.567 --> 04:31.033
BUT I CANNOT THROW,
CATCH, OR SPIT TOBACCO.

04:31.033 --> 04:33.000
SO THIS JOB IS NICE,
TOO.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.400
SO YOU WANNA BE A BELLHOP
YOUR WHOLE LIFE?

04:35.400 --> 04:38.033
OH, WELL, NO. SOME DAY
I WANT TO MANAGE THE HOTEL,

04:38.033 --> 04:40.000
BUT THAT
IS VERY FAR OFF.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.133
IS IT?

04:41.133 --> 04:42.133
THINK ABOUT IT.

04:42.133 --> 04:44.133
IF YOU CAN CONCEIVE,

04:44.133 --> 04:45.667
YOU CAN BELIEVE,

04:45.667 --> 04:47.567
AND YOU WILL ACHIEVE.

04:47.567 --> 04:48.767
I WILL?

04:48.767 --> 04:49.934
COULD I DO IT
BY THIS WEEKEND?

04:49.934 --> 04:52.000
'CAUSE I CAN USE
THE CASH.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.233
IT'S POSSIBLE

04:53.233 --> 04:54.767
ONLY IF YOU TAKE
THE FIRST STEP.

04:54.767 --> 04:58.100
ARE YOU WILLING
TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP?

04:58.100 --> 05:00.066
YES!

05:03.133 --> 05:05.367
WHAT IS THE FIRST STEP?

05:05.367 --> 05:06.200
ONLY YOU KNOW,

05:06.200 --> 05:09.300
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE PILOT
OF YOUR OWN LIFE.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.033
OH, THIS
IS A GREAT COUNTRY.

05:11.033 --> 05:12.867
I WALKED INTO
THIS ROOM A BELLHOP.

05:12.867 --> 05:15.133
I AM WALKING OUT
A PILOT AND A MANAGER.

05:15.133 --> 05:18.000
OH, DUDLEY'S
GONNA BE SO PROUD!

05:18.000 --> 05:20.200
YOUNG MAN, I HAVE
NEVER SEEN ANYBODY

05:20.200 --> 05:22.000
GRASP MY COURSE
SO QUICKLY.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.367
GEE, THANKS.
I'M A QUICK GRASPER.

05:24.367 --> 05:28.000
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE THE MAKINGS
OF A GREAT LIFE COACH.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I'LL BET BEING
A LIFE COACH WOULD COUNT

05:30.000 --> 05:32.100
AS MY SCHOOL
COMMUNITY SERVICE.

05:32.100 --> 05:33.300
WHY LIMIT YOURSELF
TO SCHOOL?

05:33.300 --> 05:36.033
YOU COULD HELP
THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY.

05:36.033 --> 05:39.000
TALK ABOUT EXTRA CREDIT!

05:39.000 --> 05:41.500
IS THAT BORING JERK
DONE YET?

05:41.500 --> 05:43.000
OH, HEY!

05:43.000 --> 05:45.600
LOVE THE LECTURE.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.133
QUICHE?

05:47.133 --> 05:49.400
THANKS.

05:52.834 --> 05:54.200
HEY, GUYS.
WHATCHA BEEN DOIN'?

05:54.200 --> 05:56.800
INSPIRING PEOPLE TO REACH
THEIR FULL POTENTIAL

05:56.800 --> 05:58.100
AND ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS.

05:58.100 --> 06:01.000
IT'S NEVER JUST
PLAYING BALL WITH YOU.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.100
SO, GUESS WHAT?

06:02.100 --> 06:05.467
I ACTUALLY COOKED--
FOR 3 HOURS.

06:05.467 --> 06:08.100
NONE FOR ME.
I'M STUFFED.

06:08.900 --> 06:12.567
MOM, DO YOU EVER
FIND YOURSELF
FEELING DISCOURAGED,

06:12.567 --> 06:15.000
UNFULFILLED,
UNAPPRECIATED?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
NOT IF YOU EAT
MY CASSEROLE.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.200
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.100
MY POINT IS,

06:21.100 --> 06:23.000
PEOPLE SPEND
THEIR LIVES TOO AFRAID

06:23.000 --> 06:25.033
TO REACH
FOR THE MOUNTAINTOP.

06:25.033 --> 06:26.100
AMEN.

06:26.100 --> 06:30.200
THEY LET LIFE SLIP BY,
DAY AFTER DREARY DAY.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.300
LOSERS.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.233
PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

06:36.200 --> 06:36.834
COME AGAIN?

06:36.834 --> 06:40.233
YOU USED TO TALK ABOUT
MAKING YOUR OWN DEMO CD

06:40.233 --> 06:41.834
OF SONGS YOU WROTE.

06:41.834 --> 06:44.033
I KNOW.
THAT WAS YEARS AGO.

06:44.033 --> 06:48.834
THAT'S RIGHT,
AND YOU HAVEN'T GOT
MANY YEARS LEFT.

06:49.300 --> 06:50.100
REMEMBER, MOM,

06:50.100 --> 06:53.000
<i>YOU </i>ARE THE PILOT
OF YOUR OWN LIFE.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.033
CAREY,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

06:55.033 --> 06:56.200
I'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.133
SURE, HONEY. SIT DOWN.

06:57.133 --> 07:00.967
YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS
HERE FOR YOU.

07:01.200 --> 07:04.033
AND APPARENTLY
SO IS CODY.

07:04.033 --> 07:05.300
OK. LONDON IS UP

07:05.300 --> 07:07.000
FOR THE COVER
OF <i>TEEN TREND </i>MAGAZINE,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.700
BUT THEY'VE ASKED ME
TO COMPETE AGAINST HER.

07:09.700 --> 07:10.734
HOW MAD DO YOU THINK
SHE'LL BE?

07:10.734 --> 07:15.000
YOU REMEMBER THE HAIRDRESSER
THAT GAVE HER THE BAD PERM?

07:15.000 --> 07:16.500
ALL THEY FOUND WAS HIS COMB.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.300
[GASPS]
THAT'S RIGHT,

07:18.300 --> 07:21.300
AND HIS BLOW-DRYER
WAS STILL RUNNING.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.133
I BETTER DROP OUT!

07:23.133 --> 07:23.800
MADDIE...

07:23.800 --> 07:26.300
DON'T LET FEAR
IN YOUR COCKPIT.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.467
DON'T LET WHAT
IN YOUR WHERE?

07:28.467 --> 07:32.200
YOU CAN'T LET LONDON PILOT
YOUR OWN LIFE FOR YOU.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.000
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.200
MADDIE...

07:36.200 --> 07:38.100
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

07:38.100 --> 07:40.500
TO WORK ON MY NEW LOOK.

07:40.500 --> 07:44.000
I'M GOING TO BE
<i>TEEN TREND'S </i>TRENDY TEEN
OF THE YEAR!

07:44.000 --> 07:45.500
THANKS, CODY.

07:46.200 --> 07:49.133
GLAD I COULD HELP!

07:57.900 --> 07:59.000
London: MADDIE!

07:59.000 --> 08:00.800
MADDIE!

08:02.500 --> 08:03.133
DO I HAVE WORRY LINES?

08:03.133 --> 08:06.934
HUH?
<i>TEEN TREND </i>HASN'T
CALLED ME YET.

08:06.934 --> 08:09.467
I CAN'T EAT,
I CAN'T SLEEP,

08:09.467 --> 08:10.700
I CAN'T THINK!

08:10.700 --> 08:12.667
DON'T GO THERE.

08:12.667 --> 08:15.300
LONDON, THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.000
NOT NOW!

08:16.000 --> 08:17.967
I MEAN, THEY JUST
HAVE TO PICK ME.

08:17.967 --> 08:20.400
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
THEY DON'T HAVE TO.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.100
IT IS, AFTER ALL,
A CONTEST,

08:22.100 --> 08:23.000
WHICH IMPLIES COMPETITORS.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
DADDY ALWAYS SAYS,
"COMPETITION
IS A GOOD THING."

08:26.000 --> 08:27.800
IT'S A CHANCE
TO CRUSH PEOPLE.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.667
SO, WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO TELL ME?

08:29.667 --> 08:34.100
IT'S 54 DEGREES OUTSIDE
AND PARTLY CLOUDY.

08:34.834 --> 08:36.567
DARLINGS,
WONDERFUL NEWS!

08:36.567 --> 08:39.400
WE'VE GONE OVER
ALL THE PICTURES
AND DECIDED.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.400
YOU TWO ARE
THE FINALISTS

08:41.400 --> 08:43.934
FOR THIS YEAR'S
TRENDY TEEN.

08:43.934 --> 08:45.200
<i>WE </i>ARE?

08:45.200 --> 08:45.934
YOU ARE!

08:45.934 --> 08:49.133
WE'VE DECIDED TO SHOOT BOTH
OF YOU HERE NEXT WEEK,

08:49.133 --> 08:51.400
AND WHOEVER COMES UP
WITH THE BEST LOOK

08:51.400 --> 08:54.000
WINS THE CONTEST
AND GETS THE COVER!

08:54.000 --> 08:56.033
ISN'T IT EXCITING?

08:56.033 --> 08:59.133
AIR KISS.
MWAH, MWAH, MWAH, MWAH!

08:59.133 --> 09:01.700
TA, DARLINGS.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.834
I'M SORRY.
DID SHE JUST SAY
YOU WERE A FINALIST

09:04.834 --> 09:07.233
FOR THE COVER OF
<i>TEEN TREND </i>AGAINST ME,

09:07.233 --> 09:11.600
WHO IS SIMPLY
THE LIVING EMBODIMENT
OF BOTH "TEEN" AND "TREND"?

09:11.600 --> 09:14.200
WELL, SHE THOUGHT MY LOOK
WAS CUTE AND AFFORDABLE.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.200
MADDIE, HOW COULD
YOU DO THIS?

09:16.200 --> 09:18.000
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE MY FRIEND.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.200
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS COVER MEANS TO ME.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.000
OK, FINE.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.100
IF YOU WANT ME TO GIVE UP
THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY

09:23.100 --> 09:26.500
SO YOU CAN GET
WHAT YOU WANT, AS ALWAYS,

09:26.500 --> 09:27.700
THEN I'LL DROP OUT.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.900
THAT'S SWEET.
DROP OUT.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.300
[GASPS]
I WILL NOT DROP OUT!

09:31.300 --> 09:32.700
HOW DARE YOU ASK ME
TO DROP OUT!

09:32.700 --> 09:36.967
YOU OFFERED!
I OFFERED BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE BIG ENOUGH TO SAY NO!

09:36.967 --> 09:38.000
WELL, THAT
WAS YOUR MISTAKE.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.367
WELL, YOUR MISTAKE
WAS TAKING ON

09:39.367 --> 09:44.100
MADELINE MARGARET GENEVIEVE
MERAIDA CATHERINE FITZPATRICK!

09:44.100 --> 09:46.033
FINE! STAY IN!

09:46.033 --> 09:47.500
I'LL BEAT ALL OF YOU.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.233
OH, YEAH? WELL,
YOU'RE GOIN' <i>DOWN! </i>

09:50.233 --> 09:52.600
WELL, YOU'RE
GOING DOWNER!

09:53.000 --> 09:54.500
I'LL CRUSH YOU SO BAD

09:54.500 --> 09:56.000
YOU WON'T HAVE A PENNY
TO YOUR NAME,

09:56.000 --> 09:57.400
AND YOU'LL HAVE TO
WORK LIKE A DOG

09:57.400 --> 09:59.100
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE!

09:59.100 --> 10:03.000
HA! I'M ALREADY THERE!

10:14.200 --> 10:17.767
HEY, MADDIE.
LOOKING GOOD...

10:17.767 --> 10:19.667
EXCEPT FOR
THOSE CRUMMY CLOTHES.

10:19.667 --> 10:23.100
THIS IS THE FIRST STEP
IN PILOTING MY OWN LIFE.

10:23.100 --> 10:26.734
OH, NO! CODY
GOT TO YOU, TOO!

10:26.734 --> 10:29.100
HE'S LIKE A VIRUS!

10:29.100 --> 10:31.367

GOTTA CLEAN.

10:31.367 --> 10:32.567
SINCE WHEN?

10:32.567 --> 10:34.600
ALL RIGHT,
YOU BUSTED ME.

10:34.600 --> 10:41.033
TRUTH IS, LONDON PAID ME
10 BUCKS TO SPY
ON BLONDIE HERE.

10:41.033 --> 10:43.367
[GASPS] THAT IS SO LOW!

10:43.367 --> 10:46.033
FOR 100, I WON'T
TELL HER I TOLD YOU.

10:46.033 --> 10:48.200
BUT I ONLY HAVE $3.00 ON ME.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.033
CLOSE ENOUGH.

10:49.033 --> 10:51.100
THIS GOES
IN MY POKER FUND.

10:51.100 --> 10:55.233
ANTE UP, BOYS. I'M
COMIN' TO CLEAN YA OUT.

10:55.233 --> 10:58.133
THAT'LL BE THE FIRST TIME
SHE CLEANED ANYTHING.

10:58.133 --> 11:01.000
THAT LONDON. I MEAN,
SHE HAS NO SCRUPLES,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
NO PRINCIPLES, NO MORALS!

11:03.000 --> 11:04.100
WANT ME TO GO SPY ON HER?
YES!

11:04.100 --> 11:07.834
AND TAKE LOTS OF PICTURES.
HERE'S MY CAMERA PHONE.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.200
WHAT IF SHE CATCHES ME?

11:11.133 --> 11:13.100
I'LL MISS YOU.

11:13.100 --> 11:14.367
IF THEY WANT
BLUE-COLLAR CHIC,

11:14.367 --> 11:16.667
I'LL GIVE THEM
BLUE-COLLAR CHIC!

11:16.667 --> 11:17.500
AAH!

11:17.500 --> 11:18.734
STOP MOVING!

11:18.734 --> 11:20.200
STOP STICKING ME!

11:20.200 --> 11:21.133
TAKE IT LIKE A MAN!

11:21.133 --> 11:23.000
NOW RAISE YOUR HEM.

11:24.900 --> 11:26.400
HOW MUCH LONGER
DO YOU NEED ME?

11:26.400 --> 11:27.500
I CAN'T BE LATE
FOR SCHOOL.

11:27.500 --> 11:32.033
YOU SEE, I HAVE TAKEN CODY'S
ADVICE TO PILOT MY OWN LIFE

11:32.033 --> 11:34.800
BY ENROLLING
IN A NIGHT CLASS
TO IMPROVE MY ENGLISH

11:34.800 --> 11:35.967
AND LOOSE MY ACCENT.

11:35.967 --> 11:40.300
LOOSE?
I HAVE NOT STARTED
CLASS YET, OK?

11:40.300 --> 11:42.867
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
COME IN!

11:44.200 --> 11:45.600
HEY, NICE DRESS.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.033
THANKS!
THANKS.

11:48.033 --> 11:48.934
HEY, IS CODY IN HERE?

11:48.934 --> 11:52.100
NO, AND I'M CREATING
MY LOOK, SO LEAVE.

11:52.100 --> 11:54.934
ALL RIGHT, BUT I NEED
TO CALL CODY.

11:54.934 --> 11:58.100
LET'S SEE IF I CAN
GET A SIGNAL IN HERE.

11:58.100 --> 12:00.400
UH, ONE BAR...

12:01.600 --> 12:04.667
UH, 2 BARS...

12:05.000 --> 12:06.033
ONE BAR...

12:06.033 --> 12:09.033
HEY, ESTEBAN, CAN YOU
TURN THIS WAY, PLEASE?

12:09.033 --> 12:10.667
THANKS.

12:10.667 --> 12:11.667
WAIT A MINUTE.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.600
IS THIS MADDIE'S
NEW CAMERA PHONE?

12:13.600 --> 12:17.000
THERE'S A CAMERA
IN THIS?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.734
COOL!

12:19.000 --> 12:20.033
YOU'RE SPYING ON ME.

12:20.033 --> 12:22.000
[GASPS] I FEEL
SO VIOLATED.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.367
WHY WOULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

12:24.367 --> 12:26.567
HAVEN'T I ALWAYS
BEEN NICE TO YOU?

12:26.567 --> 12:28.900
NO.

12:28.900 --> 12:30.000
AND I LOVE MADDIE.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.834
WELL, IF YOU
REALLY LOVE HER,

12:31.834 --> 12:34.667
YOU'LL MAKE SURE
SHE LOSES THIS CONTEST.

12:34.667 --> 12:35.100
WHY?

12:35.100 --> 12:38.367
BECAUSE IF SHE WINS,
SHE'LL BECOME SUCCESSFUL

12:38.367 --> 12:40.300
AND MOVE TO NEW YORK,
PARIS, AND MILAN,

12:40.300 --> 12:42.100
AND YOU'LL NEVER
SEE HER AGAIN.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.767
NO! I CAN NEVER
LET THAT HAPPEN!

12:44.767 --> 12:49.767
THAT'S WHAT I SAID BEFORE SHE
MADE ME PUT ON THIS DRESS.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.100
WHERE IS ZACK?

12:51.100 --> 12:53.200
I SENT HIM
TO SPY ON LONDON
OVER AN HOUR AGO.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.200
YOU'RE USING MY SON
AS A SPY?

12:55.200 --> 12:59.000
OH, LIKE YOU'RE USING HIM
FOR ANYTHING BETTER.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.200
MADDIE, I REALLY THINK
YOU'RE GETTING
A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY

13:01.200 --> 13:03.000
WITH THIS WHOLE
COMPETITION.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.567
NO, I'M NOT.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.667
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!

13:07.667 --> 13:09.200
OK, I WAS WRONG.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.100
LONDON CAUGHT ME
AND ERASED THE PICTURES.

13:12.100 --> 13:12.734
OH, NO.

13:12.734 --> 13:15.033
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER,
BECAUSE THE FASHION LADY

13:15.033 --> 13:16.200
SAID SHE LIKED
LONDON BEST,

13:16.200 --> 13:18.367
SO YOU MIGHT
AS WELL QUIT.

13:18.367 --> 13:20.300
BUT I WORKED
SO HARD.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.300
I REALLY THOUGHT
I HAD A SHOT.

13:22.300 --> 13:25.200
I'M SUCH A LOSER.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.100
I CAN'T DO THIS TO YOU.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.900
I JUST CAN'T.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.233
I CANNOT TELL A LIE.

13:30.233 --> 13:33.100
SINCE WHEN? YOU LIE
TO ME ALL THE TIME.

13:33.100 --> 13:36.000
BUT I CAN'T LIE
TO MADDIE.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.400
I <i>LOVE </i>HER!

13:40.133 --> 13:41.934
ZACK, WHY WOULD
YOU LIE TO ME?

13:41.934 --> 13:43.400
BECAUSE IF YOU WIN
THIS CONTEST,

13:43.400 --> 13:45.100
YOU'LL BECOME SUCCESSFUL,

13:45.100 --> 13:46.800
MOVE TO NEW YORK,
PARIS, OR MILAN,

13:46.800 --> 13:48.200
AND I'LL NEVER
SEE YOU AGAIN.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.400
AW, ZACK.
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

13:51.400 --> 13:54.200
AND IF I DID,
I'D TAKE YOU WITH ME.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.000
REALLY?

13:56.000 --> 13:59.033
REALLY?
[MOUTHING]

14:01.900 --> 14:03.300
AH, ESTEBAN,
THERE YOU ARE.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.100
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO WORK LATE TONIGHT.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.734
OH, NO, I CAN'T,
MR. MOSEBY.

14:06.734 --> 14:07.967
I AM PILOTING
MY OWN LIFE

14:07.967 --> 14:10.800
BY TAKING A NIGHT SCHOOL
CLASS 3 TIMES A WEEK.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.500
I AM GOING TO
LOOSE MY ACCENT.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.000
LOOSE?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.767
I BETTER MAKE THAT
4 TIMES A WEEK.

14:18.033 --> 14:20.033
MR. MOSEBY, I'M GONNA
NEED THE WEEKEND OFF.

14:20.033 --> 14:23.700
OH, LET ME GUESS.
YOU'RE GONNA PILOT
YOUR OWN LIFE, HMM?

14:23.700 --> 14:26.033
YES! I NEED TO WORK
ON MY DEMO CD.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.200
THANK YOU
FOR UNDERSTANDING.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.500
MMM. FINE. GO, GO, GO!
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.367
I'LL JUST CLEAN
ALL THE ROOMS

14:32.367 --> 14:33.133
AND CARRY THE LUGGAGE

14:33.133 --> 14:36.300
AND SING IN A SLINKY
COCKTAIL DRESS.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.133
I'M KIDDING!

14:41.133 --> 14:45.600
IT'S A VERY TASTEFUL
COCKTAIL DRESS.

14:45.600 --> 14:46.600
OHH!

14:49.734 --> 14:53.400
I CAN'T BELIEVE I STAYED UP
3 DAYS AND NIGHTS
FINISHING THIS OUTFIT.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.867
I HOPE THE <i>TEEN TREND </i>LADY
LIKES IT.

14:55.867 --> 14:56.700
I'M SURE
YOU'LL DO FINE.

14:56.700 --> 14:59.367
"I'M SURE YOU'LL DO FINE."
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

14:59.367 --> 15:03.600
SEE? THIS IS WHY SLEEP
IS A GOOD THING.

15:04.467 --> 15:06.200
DO YOU REALLY
LIKE MY OUTFIT?

15:06.200 --> 15:08.000
YOU REALLY THINK
I'M GONNA WIN?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
REMEMBER, LONDON,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.867
IF YOU CAN CONCEIVE,
YOU CAN BELIEVE,

15:11.867 --> 15:15.300

I HATE THAT EXPRESSION!

15:20.567 --> 15:22.500
HEY, YOU STOLE MY LOOK!

15:22.500 --> 15:24.700
STOLE? I MADE
YOUR LOUSY LOOK BETTER.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.734
IF IT'S SO LOUSY,
WHY'D YOU STEAL IT?

15:26.734 --> 15:28.400
BECAUSE IF THEY
LIKED IT ON YOU,

15:28.400 --> 15:29.400
THEY'LL <i>LOVE </i>IT ON ME.

15:29.400 --> 15:32.500
BESIDES, THERE ARE
A LOT OF DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN OUR OUTFITS,

15:32.500 --> 15:35.200
LIKE THE FACT YOURS
IS MADE OUT OF CHEAP FABRIC.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.200

15:36.200 --> 15:37.834

FAKE COTTON,

TO PICK WITH YOU.

18:54.834 --> 18:55.767
ESTEBAN?

18:55.767 --> 18:57.200
WHY ARE YOU
TALKING LIKE THAT?

18:57.200 --> 19:00.967
'CAUSE MY NEW INSTRUCTOR
JEB IS FROM TEXAS.

19:00.967 --> 19:02.934
NOW IF I WANNA PILOT
MY OWN LIFE,

19:02.934 --> 19:06.800
I GOTTA DO IT
AT A RODEO. YEE-HAW!

19:07.834 --> 19:10.100
THANK Y'ALL.

19:10.100 --> 19:13.500
OK, SO I'VE MADE
A COUPLE OF MISTAKES.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.500
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
MY LIFE COACHING
DOESN'T WORK.

19:16.500 --> 19:20.100
MOM, PLEASE TELL ME
EVERYTHING WENT OK
WITH YOUR DEMO CD.

19:20.100 --> 19:20.967
OH, YEAH.

19:20.967 --> 19:23.667
THE GUY AT
THE RECORD COMPANY
SAID I WAS REALLY TALENTED

19:23.667 --> 19:26.300
AND HAVE A FUTURE
AS A CABARET SINGER.

19:26.300 --> 19:29.000
HE SUGGESTED
I CHECK OUT THE TIPTON.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.834
APPARENTLY, I JUST
SPENT $500 TO FIND OUT

19:31.834 --> 19:36.000
I'M EXACTLY WHERE
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE!

19:36.967 --> 19:39.867
WELL, YOU MAY BE THE FIRST
MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER

19:39.867 --> 19:41.867
TO LOSE HIS ALLOWANCE.

19:41.867 --> 19:42.400
OH, WELL.

19:42.400 --> 19:45.967
AT LEAST I KNOW I'LL GET
A BETTER COMMUNITY SERVICE
GRADE THAN ZACK.

19:45.967 --> 19:48.300
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

19:48.300 --> 19:52.000
MR. MOSEBY LET ME TAKE
ALL THE BUFFET LEFTOVERS
TO THE MISSION.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.700
THE MAYOR WAS THERE,
AND HE'S GIVING ME AN AWARD

19:54.700 --> 19:56.300
FOR HELPING THE HOMELESS.

19:56.300 --> 19:57.567
<i>YOU?! </i>

19:57.567 --> 19:59.300
AN AWARD?

19:59.300 --> 20:01.934
YOU CAN'T EVEN
SPELL "AWARD"!

20:01.934 --> 20:03.300
DON'T HAVE TO.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.000
IT'LL BE ON THE PLAQUE.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.233
WHO'S GETTING AN "A"
IN COMMUNITY SERVICE
NOW, HUH?

20:09.934 --> 20:13.400
I HATE THAT KID.

20:20.834 --> 20:21.600
[SIGHS]

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

20:27.500 --> 20:30.500
OW, OW, OW.

20:31.100 --> 20:33.600
IF YOU CAME UP HERE TO TEAR
UP THE REST OF MY CLOTHES,

20:33.600 --> 20:36.000
GOOD LUCK
IT'LL TAKE YOU 6 WEEKS,

20:36.000 --> 20:37.934
AND THAT'S JUST
MY TENNIS OUTFITS.

20:37.934 --> 20:39.967
ACTUALLY, I CAME UP HERE
TO APOLOGIZE.

20:39.967 --> 20:44.033
I DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW IMPORTANT BEING
ON THIS COVER WAS TO YOU.

20:44.033 --> 20:45.600
YEAH, YOU DID.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.800
OK, I DID.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.300
BUT SINCE YOU HAVE
EVERYTHING,

20:49.300 --> 20:52.400
I JUST KIND OF FIGURED
IT WOULDN'T MATTER
THAT MUCH TO YOU.

20:52.400 --> 20:56.033
WELL, YOU WERE WRONG,
WITH A CAPITAL "R."

20:57.667 --> 20:59.033
I KNOW,

20:59.033 --> 21:00.900
AND I'M SORRY.

21:01.300 --> 21:01.867
THANKS.

21:01.867 --> 21:05.100
[SIGHS] I'M SORRY I STOLE
YOUR BLUE-COLLAR CHEAP LOOK.

21:05.100 --> 21:08.233
YOU MEAN CHIC.
NO.

21:08.867 --> 21:11.300
WELL, I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU HAD STYLE.

21:11.300 --> 21:13.400
AWW!

21:13.400 --> 21:15.000
TO MAKE THIS APOLOGY
THING END,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
DO I HAVE TO LIE AND SAY
YOU HAVE STYLE, TOO?

21:17.000 --> 21:19.400
YES.
I THINK YOU HAVE
STYLE, TOO.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.500
THANK YOU FOR LYING.

21:36.767 --> 21:38.000
[LAUGHS]
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
"THE LATEST FASHION
AMONG TEEN GIRLS

21:40.000 --> 21:41.300
IS BEING CALLED
URBAN DECAY."

21:41.300 --> 21:43.900
OK, I'VE SEEN
SOME RIDICULOUS FASHIONS
BEFORE,

21:43.900 --> 21:45.900
BUT <i>TEEN TREND'S </i>GONE
TOO FAR THIS TIME.

21:45.900 --> 21:49.367
LIKE ANYONE WOULD
BE STUPID ENOUGH TO WEAR
RIPPED CLOTHING.

21:49.367 --> 21:52.967
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, LADIES?

21:53.367 --> 21:55.200
