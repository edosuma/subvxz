02:17.792 --> 02:19.104
Ah shit.

02:20.312 --> 02:22.313
Lieutenant Randall.
Yes damn it.

02:22.314 --> 02:24.557
Wilson sir, RAF.
Hey do you mind?

02:24.558 --> 02:25.386
Sorry sir.

02:27.181 --> 02:28.009
Which way?

02:30.529 --> 02:32.910
You know why I joined
the US Air Force Wilson?

02:32.911 --> 02:34.083
No sir.

02:34.084 --> 02:37.157
To see my beautiful
country, and to be in the air.

02:38.019 --> 02:41.090
Instead I'm walking through
a freezing English forest

02:41.091 --> 02:42.954
because one of your guys
said he saw a light.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.301
You're commanding
officer felt somebody

02:44.302 --> 02:45.957
from both countries
should investigate sir.

02:45.958 --> 02:48.513
My commanding officer is a dick.

02:50.549 --> 02:51.516
Shine it over here.

02:55.865 --> 02:58.799
Resin, trees been
exposed to heat.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.905
Camp fires?
No sign of one.

03:04.701 --> 03:05.530
Shine up.

03:08.464 --> 03:10.775
Branch is broken
up in the tree-line.

03:10.776 --> 03:14.194
Something came down, your
man might have seen something.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.748
Okay, let's move off this,

03:17.749 --> 03:20.509
shit what the hell is that?

03:20.510 --> 03:22.822
We have a body sir, looks
Vietnamese what's left of him.

03:22.823 --> 03:24.859
I think I stepped
on some of him.

03:54.372 --> 03:57.201
We're close, I think,
that's what the map says.

03:57.202 --> 03:58.478
That's where the lady is.

03:58.479 --> 04:00.239
Why you want
to talk to this lady?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.930
Plenty of nice girls in Hanoi.

04:01.931 --> 04:03.794
No, no, no thanks, ah this lady

04:03.795 --> 04:05.727
witnessed an abduction,
her friend was taken.

04:05.728 --> 04:07.211
So we go to police?

04:07.212 --> 04:09.731
Oh I don't think so,
she said a craft appeared

04:09.732 --> 04:11.560
as big as three of those
mountains up there.

04:11.561 --> 04:13.217
Craft?
A UFO.

04:13.218 --> 04:16.289
UFO right, sightings in Vietnam
are actually quite common.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.911
Urgh, oh God, I think I
got a fly in my mouth.

04:18.913 --> 04:20.052
That's disgusting.

04:22.434 --> 04:24.332
This is her.

04:24.333 --> 04:25.954
Hello, don't be afraid.

04:25.955 --> 04:27.093
Where was her friend standing?

04:34.964 --> 04:36.275
And where was the UFO?

05:02.094 --> 05:07.099
Yes, I can confirm that,
that's a definite, yes ma'am.

05:09.101 --> 05:14.106
Several, at least 10, they're
all in separate containers.

05:18.214 --> 05:20.837
Well some are mac and cheese
and some are sandwiches.

05:22.218 --> 05:24.426
Because she likes them Patrice,

05:24.427 --> 05:26.049
there's fruit in there too okay.

05:27.499 --> 05:31.053
Look, I got to go, yeah, yeah

05:31.054 --> 05:33.643
I'll be home late
tonight okay, bye.

05:40.719 --> 05:42.168
Agent Kendrick.

05:42.169 --> 05:44.653
I don't really have a
title, just call me Kendrick.

05:44.654 --> 05:45.585
Yes sir.

05:45.586 --> 05:46.932
Where?
Up island.

06:03.328 --> 06:04.570
Scene secure.

06:04.571 --> 06:07.435
Private beach, owners
don't come til August.

06:07.436 --> 06:08.816
Not much to secure really.

06:10.611 --> 06:11.578
Oh let me get this.

06:19.896 --> 06:21.242
Estimated TOD.

06:22.347 --> 06:23.727
Uh hi, who are you?

06:23.728 --> 06:26.696
This is agent,
this is Mr. Kendrick.

06:28.111 --> 06:30.389
I'm estimating time of death
is when he hit the ground,

06:30.390 --> 06:33.737
six o'clock this morning, in
front of two 15 year olds.

06:33.738 --> 06:36.187
One of them my stepdaughter
who's now grounded.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.430
Small community.

06:37.431 --> 06:38.949
They claim they
saw flashes of light

06:38.950 --> 06:40.502
and then Ben Murphy and his crew

06:40.503 --> 06:42.987
disappear from his boat
a little ways off shore.

06:42.988 --> 06:44.161
A local fishing crew.

06:44.162 --> 06:45.542
The boat?

06:45.543 --> 06:47.820
Pulled it in this morning,
no sign of the crew,

06:47.821 --> 06:49.615
nothing suspicious on the boat.

06:49.616 --> 06:52.514
The girls had ingested several
office cleaning products.

06:52.515 --> 06:54.033
The wounds indicate?

06:54.034 --> 06:57.968
He fell from pretty high
up, as in from a plane.

06:57.969 --> 06:59.418
ID?

06:59.419 --> 07:00.696
Found this in his pocket.

07:04.493 --> 07:05.459
Kurt Nesbo.

07:06.909 --> 07:10.221
Says he's from Oslo, also
found this in the wallet.

07:10.222 --> 07:13.984
Ticket to a gala show or
something, Oslo opera house.

07:13.985 --> 07:16.883
But it's dated April 30th 2013,

07:16.884 --> 07:18.678
that's almost a year from
now, he must have really

07:18.679 --> 07:19.921
want to see that show.

07:19.922 --> 07:24.408
This ticket's been
torn, he saw the show.

07:24.409 --> 07:26.584
He, sorry he what?

08:00.272 --> 08:03.655
ID was confirmed, Kurt
Nesbo of Oslo Norway.

08:04.760 --> 08:08.279
Cause of death,
injuries from a fall.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.868
All flights that evening were
grounded due to the storm,

08:10.869 --> 08:13.768
over one year later we track
reports of a Kurt Nesbo,

08:13.769 --> 08:17.599
same ID, disappearing from a
gala at the opera house at Oslo

08:17.600 --> 08:18.601
during intermission.

08:24.055 --> 08:27.816
Sorry, DC Metro sucks,
why are we in a hotel?

08:27.817 --> 08:28.784
We own it.

08:30.579 --> 08:34.754
ID, Stanley.

08:34.755 --> 08:35.583
Gillman.

08:37.724 --> 08:38.793
DOD owns a hotel.

08:38.794 --> 08:39.691
Sit down.

08:42.763 --> 08:46.180
The same time the body dropped
that image was sent to us.

08:47.596 --> 08:49.528
Sent?
Sent in the mail,

08:49.529 --> 08:51.669
on a phone that hadn't
been invented yet.

08:54.913 --> 08:58.261
Well, they don't know
how to spell happy.

08:59.815 --> 09:01.609
We got IDs on any of these guys?

09:01.610 --> 09:03.196
One of them's MOD.

09:03.197 --> 09:04.578
Ministry of Defense UK.

09:05.752 --> 09:07.925
Yes, thank you I
know what it means.

09:07.926 --> 09:09.375
Do we have a map?

09:09.376 --> 09:11.480
You show up late to
an eyes only briefing

09:11.481 --> 09:14.104
and you, you would like a map.

09:14.105 --> 09:16.521
Like a really big map
that we can put pins in.

09:19.904 --> 09:21.007
Do you see a pattern?

09:21.008 --> 09:22.802
Let me save you some energy,

09:22.803 --> 09:24.390
we know where it's
gonna happen next.

09:24.391 --> 09:25.978
Okay how?

09:25.979 --> 09:27.048
They told us.

09:27.049 --> 09:28.395
They told you?
They?

09:29.672 --> 09:30.845
What did they say?

09:30.846 --> 09:32.709
They have a proposal
and they want us

09:32.710 --> 09:34.296
to see it happen again.

09:34.297 --> 09:35.091
Where?

09:44.791 --> 09:46.965
Lower cumtrch, lower coom,

09:51.556 --> 09:53.558
lower cum, lower cumtwa,

09:54.973 --> 09:56.629
how do you even say that?

09:58.149 --> 09:59.943
Huw Richards
has called in, saying there's

09:59.944 --> 10:02.497
a New Years Eve party
in Lower Cwmtwrch.

10:02.498 --> 10:05.120
Not to be confused with
Upper Cwmtwrch of course,

10:05.121 --> 10:08.917
where the special DJ
host, sponsored by

10:08.918 --> 10:11.264
Selwyn Reese, the fishmonger.

10:11.265 --> 10:14.405
Nothing fishy, just delishy.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.545
Might want to think about
hiring a new marketing

10:16.546 --> 10:20.653
team Selwyn, just
kidding, or am I?

10:20.654 --> 10:22.828
Welsh language radio
is coming up in a mo,

10:22.829 --> 10:25.347
but first here's
the new classic.

11:31.207 --> 11:32.621
Hi there, you're
through to Steve Dennis,

11:32.622 --> 11:35.003
the Microphone Menace,
do you know what to do,

11:35.004 --> 11:36.074
oh I think you do.

11:37.593 --> 11:40.043
Oh Steve where the fuck are you?

11:40.044 --> 11:43.529
You told me to meet you
here, it's your party in it,

11:43.530 --> 11:45.601
give me a ring back
alright, it's Huw bye.

11:55.645 --> 11:56.439
They're mine.

11:58.821 --> 12:01.202
You're fit but
you're not that fit.

12:01.203 --> 12:01.997
Yeah right.

12:03.377 --> 12:06.621
So is this where you
give me the speech.

12:06.622 --> 12:07.485
What speech?

12:08.624 --> 12:11.246
It was fun, but
you're a famous DJ,

12:11.247 --> 12:14.008
need to get back to
London, don't have time

12:14.009 --> 12:16.389
for anything remotely
serious, blah, blah, blah.

12:16.390 --> 12:19.634
No I, I wasn't gonna say that.

12:19.635 --> 12:20.911
Okay.

12:20.912 --> 12:22.603
No what I was gonna say was,

12:25.261 --> 12:27.504
if I'm honest I'm
not a good person

12:27.505 --> 12:30.265
and that nice guy
veneer from the radio

12:30.266 --> 12:31.991
is easy to sustain
on the airwaves

12:31.992 --> 12:36.858
but let's face it, we were both
just in this for ourselves,

12:36.859 --> 12:38.342
you know, for personal gain.

12:38.343 --> 12:40.276
So I think it's best
if I just leave.

12:42.140 --> 12:45.765
But although we only
had a few hours,

12:48.698 --> 12:51.322
we had the passion
of a lifetime.

12:53.427 --> 12:56.776
That's from a film, that
last thing you just said,

12:58.087 --> 12:59.709
that's from The Terminator.

13:01.090 --> 13:02.850
You couldn't even be
bothered to watch a Rom com

13:02.851 --> 13:04.541
and steal something from that.

13:04.542 --> 13:06.715
You decided to quote a
film about a killer cyborg

13:06.716 --> 13:07.925
who travels through time.

13:10.306 --> 13:12.618
It is romantic to be fair,
no it is, at the end...

13:12.619 --> 13:14.689
Fuck off Steve.
Thanks.

13:14.690 --> 13:19.695
Okay good, I never
liked you okay.

13:20.558 --> 13:21.903
Thank you for that Steve.

13:21.904 --> 13:23.802
Good, well thanks
for everything.

13:23.803 --> 13:24.768
Thank you.

13:24.769 --> 13:26.183
Take care.
You too.

13:26.184 --> 13:27.115
I'll get dressed downstairs
so don't worry about...

13:27.116 --> 13:28.323
Bye Steve, thank you.

13:28.324 --> 13:29.152
Bye then.

13:29.153 --> 13:30.257
Bye.
Good.

13:31.914 --> 13:34.226
Hi, sorry I missed your
call, I was in a meeting.

13:34.227 --> 13:36.780
Yeah, yeah, you told me
to meet you here at eight,

13:36.781 --> 13:38.023
it's your party mate.

13:38.024 --> 13:39.472
Yeah, how many takers?

13:39.473 --> 13:41.302
A few, not many.

13:41.303 --> 13:42.786
Just a few.

13:42.787 --> 13:43.718
There's a big New Years
Eve thing at Cinders,

13:43.719 --> 13:45.271
a lot of people going to that.

13:45.272 --> 13:46.963
Look I've got an investor
coming from London,

13:46.964 --> 13:49.862
I need more people
there, please Huw,

13:49.863 --> 13:52.106
just get me some
more fucking people.

13:52.107 --> 13:52.935
Thanks.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.050
Miles, Sunita, whenever
you don't call me

14:05.051 --> 14:06.741
for this long I know
something's going on.

14:06.742 --> 14:11.022
So I am moderately
concerned, call me back, bye.

14:12.506 --> 14:14.887
There's something about
this guy you keep calling.

14:14.888 --> 14:15.819
Who says it's a guy?

14:15.820 --> 14:17.303
Because your voice goes funny.

14:17.304 --> 14:18.580
It's work thank you.

14:18.581 --> 14:20.203
Yeah, well you're
always on the phone.

14:20.204 --> 14:22.343
Am I, do you wanna
try and take it back.

14:22.344 --> 14:23.758
Go on, do you wanna try...

14:23.759 --> 14:26.140
This is a holiday
alright, so we need to stay

14:26.141 --> 14:27.866
away from technology.

14:32.216 --> 14:34.251
That's bloody Steve.

14:34.252 --> 14:35.321
Hello Steve.

14:35.322 --> 14:36.357
Why did I come back to Wales?

14:36.358 --> 14:37.599
You tell me.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.877
Someone's nicked my fucking car.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.740
Hi Steve.

14:40.741 --> 14:43.502
Oh is that Suny,
how's she doing?

14:43.503 --> 14:44.848
Still my sister.

14:44.849 --> 14:45.780
Half sister isn't it.

14:45.781 --> 14:47.471
She has my full protection.

14:47.472 --> 14:50.371
I was just checking
mate, how far away are you?

14:50.372 --> 14:51.960
About 45 minutes.

14:54.169 --> 14:55.341
Call me when you're
five minutes away,

14:55.342 --> 14:56.446
I'll tell you which pub.

14:56.447 --> 14:59.173
Great.

14:59.174 --> 15:01.797
What, nothing happened Naveen.

15:02.832 --> 15:04.488
Yeah.

15:33.346 --> 15:35.935
Oh that's a big screen, nice.

15:38.282 --> 15:39.454
Would have been nice
if we had it earlier.

15:39.455 --> 15:41.077
Excuse me.

15:41.078 --> 15:42.009
I mean that's not just
in the movies right,

15:42.010 --> 15:44.149
they do have those situations.

15:44.150 --> 15:46.945
They do have those yes,
do you know the budget

15:46.946 --> 15:49.119
that gets allocated
to this department?

15:49.120 --> 15:51.604
Seeing as how it
officially doesn't exist.

15:51.605 --> 15:54.504
You want to be in agriculture,
they get a lot of money.

15:54.505 --> 15:56.230
You should see the size
of the TVs and conference

15:56.231 --> 15:57.783
rooms for them.

15:57.784 --> 15:59.543
I hope I'm not out
of line here sir,

15:59.544 --> 16:02.650
that file implies that
time traveling aliens

16:02.651 --> 16:06.102
are doing experiments on
humans and making a power play.

16:06.103 --> 16:07.620
Isn't this an imminent threat?

16:07.621 --> 16:11.038
Not to us, they come at
us, you'd be seeing that

16:11.039 --> 16:13.109
on a very big screen.

16:13.110 --> 16:14.489
Weather reports.

16:14.490 --> 16:16.250
Cloud and rain up in
Scotland, but due to blow north

16:16.251 --> 16:19.598
not south, you wanna tell
me what we're looking for?

16:19.599 --> 16:22.360
You'll know it when you see it.

16:45.487 --> 16:46.315
Hello.

16:51.182 --> 16:52.011
Hello.

16:59.880 --> 17:00.640
Hello.

17:03.229 --> 17:04.057
Hello.

17:09.752 --> 17:10.580
Hello.

17:11.444 --> 17:14.550
Jesus.

17:16.069 --> 17:20.107
Steve Dennis, good job I
hid you could have been

17:20.108 --> 17:21.730
someone coming to rob the place.

17:23.111 --> 17:27.665
Not me, I just broadcast
criminally good entertainment.

17:27.666 --> 17:30.118
You remember me
from school Steven?

17:31.429 --> 17:36.158
I tried to teach your geography,
I failed, but I tried.

17:38.919 --> 17:42.888
Mr. Jones, Robert Jones.

17:42.889 --> 17:45.580
Yes of course, Bobby
J, Bob the Bones.

17:45.581 --> 17:47.514
No, I just made that name up.

17:48.619 --> 17:49.584
Alan Thomas.

17:49.585 --> 17:52.139
Yeah, Mr. T.

17:52.140 --> 17:53.486
Made that one up as well.

17:55.212 --> 17:56.971
Yep, Mr. Jenkins.

17:56.972 --> 17:58.939
Sergeant Jenkins.

18:00.424 --> 18:03.046
Got my old job as a copper back.

18:03.047 --> 18:06.981
Plus I own the pub.

18:06.982 --> 18:09.570
Right, well congratulations.

18:09.571 --> 18:11.365
I'm on duty tonight.

18:11.366 --> 18:12.745
Oh I'm sorry.

18:12.746 --> 18:17.751
No, I love it,
feel of the streets.

18:20.168 --> 18:21.927
Well it's just the one
street really isn't it,

18:21.928 --> 18:23.273
and a few lanes.

18:23.274 --> 18:28.175
Parties, noise
complaints, I'll be on that.

18:28.176 --> 18:30.453
You're having a party
aren't you Steven?

18:30.454 --> 18:33.284
Just a little
shindig, nothing um,

18:36.184 --> 18:39.358
warming up from about 3
PM, mellow stuff initially

18:39.359 --> 18:41.360
before we kick into
the drum and base.

18:41.361 --> 18:42.810
Might have to stop by.

18:42.811 --> 18:44.674
Yeah do when your shifts done,

18:44.675 --> 18:45.847
I'll save you a few drinks.

18:45.848 --> 18:49.680
Check on the noise, bye bye now.

18:51.371 --> 18:53.200
I actually just fancied a pint.

18:53.201 --> 18:54.305
Tata.
Okay.

18:56.859 --> 18:58.102
Nice to see you sir.

19:04.039 --> 19:09.044
Twat.

19:21.781 --> 19:23.161
So how you been Suny
everything alright?

19:23.162 --> 19:25.059
Yeah, good, you?

19:25.060 --> 19:27.786
Yeah great, really
great, good thanks.

19:27.787 --> 19:30.996
Now to Steve
Dennis the microphone menace.

19:30.997 --> 19:33.343
Hey it's me, it's the show.

19:33.344 --> 19:36.346
Not live obviously
because we're in the car.

19:36.347 --> 19:38.556
Pre-recorded that's
what we call that.

19:39.730 --> 19:40.902
Soon I'll be menacing again

19:40.903 --> 19:42.387
when I phone some feminists

19:42.388 --> 19:45.700
to ask for their bra sizes,
if you're gonna burn 'em,

19:45.701 --> 19:47.185
got to earn 'em.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.877
Now we've had lots of
emails in for Steve's...

19:49.878 --> 19:51.844
There he is.

19:51.845 --> 19:54.158
What is your favorite hole?

19:55.297 --> 19:56.609
You can park over there.

19:57.575 --> 19:58.817
That's Naveen.

19:58.818 --> 20:00.405
Didn't you used
to work the Viceroy?

20:00.406 --> 20:03.304
No, no, no he didn't, no that's
a mate of mine from London

20:03.305 --> 20:05.306
with tons of cash and
that's his sister.

20:05.307 --> 20:07.860
So no, none of
your jokes alright.

20:07.861 --> 20:09.276
What jokes?

20:09.277 --> 20:11.761
Any of the ones that you tell.

20:11.762 --> 20:15.490
<i>♪ Burned by my velvet dreams</i>

20:17.871 --> 20:19.597
He's not using a turn table?

20:21.012 --> 20:23.048
Well turn tables were
out, and then they were in,

20:23.049 --> 20:26.189
and now they're, well
actually they're still in,

20:26.190 --> 20:28.122
we just couldn't get
one, could we Tony.

20:28.123 --> 20:29.192
Nah.

20:29.193 --> 20:30.642
And you know Steve how?

20:30.643 --> 20:33.300
Friends of his moms,
and we run the local B&B.

20:33.301 --> 20:34.818
If his venture gets
off the ground,

20:34.819 --> 20:36.406
then we'll give his
guest DJs a discount,

20:36.407 --> 20:37.407
won't we Ton.

20:37.408 --> 20:38.270
Aye.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.133
His venture?

20:39.134 --> 20:40.617
Yeah, Valley Palace.

20:40.618 --> 20:41.584
Sorry?

20:41.585 --> 20:44.103
VIP Nightclubs in the valleys.

20:44.104 --> 20:45.553
He wants to set
something up back here

20:45.554 --> 20:48.211
what with them probably
firing him in London you know.

20:48.212 --> 20:49.558
Oh my fucking mouth.

20:52.181 --> 20:54.598
Hi, is there a
corkscrew anywhere?

20:55.702 --> 20:56.944
Sorry?

20:56.945 --> 20:59.291
A corkscrew?
Corkscrew?

20:59.292 --> 21:01.500
Yeah, yeah, I bought some wine.

21:01.501 --> 21:03.158
Yeah I know what it's for.

21:04.470 --> 21:05.815
Don't say anything will you.

21:05.816 --> 21:07.023
Of course not.

21:07.024 --> 21:09.440
Stick some 90s stuff
on Steve, oh, oh.

21:11.753 --> 21:13.548
So there is a corkscrew yeah?

21:14.825 --> 21:16.723
No, sorry.

Still at the travel agent?

21:47.892 --> 21:48.686
Yep.

21:50.447 --> 21:51.723
Valley Palace.

21:51.724 --> 21:53.725
No, fucking Ryan.

21:53.726 --> 21:55.140
Is that why I'm down here?

21:55.141 --> 21:56.383
What do you mean?

21:56.384 --> 21:57.970
Because of Nav, he could invest

21:57.971 --> 21:59.834
and it would seem
odd not to invite me.

21:59.835 --> 22:01.284
I thought you both
might like a nice weekend

22:01.285 --> 22:02.803
out of the city.

22:02.804 --> 22:04.943
I don't know why you act
so weird around me Steve.

22:04.944 --> 22:06.151
Is it because
something happened,

22:06.152 --> 22:07.705
or because not enough happened?

22:08.982 --> 22:13.401
Here's the thing
Suni, you, me, we,

22:14.505 --> 22:17.404
had a great few
moments but ultimately

22:17.405 --> 22:20.199
each person had to protect
their own interests.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.787
When you think about it
we were both just in it

22:21.788 --> 22:22.754
for ourselves.

22:22.755 --> 22:24.100
Unbelievable.

22:24.101 --> 22:25.584
Thank you.

22:25.585 --> 22:27.172
You said the same thing
to me the next morning.

22:27.173 --> 22:29.657
The funny thing is you
probably don't even remember

22:29.658 --> 22:32.591
what happened, would you
like me to remind you?

22:32.592 --> 22:36.940
No, if I could potentially
not be full of shit

22:36.941 --> 22:38.563
do you think it might
be possible to...

22:38.564 --> 22:40.668
Excuse me can you turn
the music down please.

22:40.669 --> 22:43.015
Ah, hello again.

22:43.016 --> 22:44.914
Agnes, Agnes Dee.

22:44.915 --> 22:47.744
Very good, Agnes
Davis, it is printed

22:47.745 --> 22:49.436
on all the red gas
bills in the hallway

22:49.437 --> 22:50.955
so you're not exactly Sherlock.

22:52.301 --> 22:53.475
Go back inside shall I.

22:54.407 --> 22:55.201
I'm comin' in.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.204
Hello.
Hi.

22:59.205 --> 23:01.344
Agnes D, see told you
I remembered your name.

23:01.345 --> 23:03.139
My dad lives on the next farm,

23:03.140 --> 23:04.313
he wants the music off.

23:05.660 --> 23:07.039
Can I do anything
to change his mind?

23:07.040 --> 23:09.214
He's a raging alcoholic,
I could take him

23:09.215 --> 23:11.906
a bottle of vodka to act
as a sort of sedative.

23:11.907 --> 23:15.082
But in return I would
require a bottle for myself

23:15.083 --> 23:18.982
and an invitation to this
doubtless amazing party.

23:18.983 --> 23:20.259
Um.

23:20.260 --> 23:21.502
Oh go on, I'll even
throw in a cover story

23:21.503 --> 23:22.952
about how we're just
platonic friends,

23:22.953 --> 23:24.712
so you can try and
shag the Indian bird,

23:24.713 --> 23:26.231
she's very pretty.

23:26.232 --> 23:27.302
We're just friends.

23:30.443 --> 23:31.686
We're all just friends.

23:34.585 --> 23:35.414
This way.

23:37.139 --> 23:37.968
Yeah.

23:51.913 --> 23:53.259
So all that...

23:55.123 --> 23:56.780
I thought you were
in the hallway.

23:59.023 --> 24:01.923
No you're mistaken.

24:07.342 --> 24:08.170
Right.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.207
Just had a large cloud
mass form over Calais

24:11.208 --> 24:14.314
within seconds moving west.

24:15.592 --> 24:17.247
Here it comes.

24:17.248 --> 24:19.526
Smells good, what's on it?

24:19.527 --> 24:21.320
Pepperoni.

24:21.321 --> 24:23.945
Vegetarian, thanks for checking.

24:27.362 --> 24:30.295
Huw, stop drinking
now, alright, that's it,

24:30.296 --> 24:34.575
nice big smiles,
one, two, three.

24:34.576 --> 24:36.370
Happy New Year.

24:36.371 --> 24:38.304

24:40.927 --> 24:42.272
Good.

25:48.616 --> 25:53.586
Normally packed in here,
fucking Steve Dennis.

25:54.069 --> 25:54.898
Sorry.

25:57.141 --> 25:59.039
Another shandy?

25:59.040 --> 26:00.731
No I'm fine with
this one thanks.

26:02.077 --> 26:05.115
Well, I'm fine with my scotch.

26:06.806 --> 26:07.635
Right.

26:08.670 --> 26:09.843
Can I ask you a question?

26:09.844 --> 26:11.085
What?

26:11.086 --> 26:13.019
Is anyone round
here having a party?

26:14.400 --> 26:16.298
Do you recognize
any of these people?

26:18.922 --> 26:20.163
Never seen them.

26:20.164 --> 26:21.820
Okay great stuff,

26:21.821 --> 26:23.304
Right.

26:23.305 --> 26:24.582
And it wouldn't be new
years eve without some odd

26:24.583 --> 26:26.342
phone calls, here we
have some listeners

26:26.343 --> 26:29.104
reporting UFO's in Neath.

26:30.002 --> 26:31.381
Neath.

26:31.382 --> 26:33.592
Mr. Barnes, you gonna
pay for that shandy.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.595
Alright, I love what
you've done with the place,

26:37.596 --> 26:40.495
really nice, tinsel,
Happy New Year.

26:41.669 --> 26:43.049
Fucking weirdo.

27:05.347 --> 27:06.176
Hello!

27:11.699 --> 27:12.492
Hello!

27:32.720 --> 27:35.412
If this is Huw having
a girly giggle,

27:36.585 --> 27:38.346
I will plant mushrooms on you,

27:41.038 --> 27:44.869
fucking will as well!

28:21.941 --> 28:25.185
What the fuck are
you playing at?

28:31.640 --> 28:32.952
How you doing?

28:35.058 --> 28:37.335
It's the microphone menace.

28:37.336 --> 28:39.096
That's right it is me.

28:40.477 --> 28:43.203
So boys grab your girls,
boys grab your boys whatever,

28:43.204 --> 28:46.275
I don't judge, almost
that time of the evening

28:46.276 --> 28:49.210
where I get to wish
you a Happy New Year.

28:50.590 --> 28:52.799
Alright let's do this,
let's start this countdown.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.008
10, nine...

28:55.181 --> 28:57.044
Whoa, whoa you're
30 seconds out Steve,

28:57.045 --> 28:58.563
it says on my app.

28:58.564 --> 29:02.222
Oh, I'm 30 seconds off,
that's fine, I can fill,

29:02.223 --> 29:03.431
I can do this.
Yeah.

29:06.434 --> 29:08.193
Thank you's I guess.

29:08.194 --> 29:10.575
Nav, Suni I love you
guys coming all the way

29:10.576 --> 29:13.164
from London, you are
brilliant thank you.

29:13.165 --> 29:15.683
Ryan and of course
the gorgeous Tommy

29:15.684 --> 29:17.893
offering wonderful deals
at the Peacock B&B.

29:17.894 --> 29:21.344
Go and stay there if
you're gonna stay anywhere.

29:21.345 --> 29:24.451
And who else, oh yes,
there he is, the main man,

29:24.452 --> 29:26.418
Selwyn Reese and his fried fish.

29:26.419 --> 29:27.661
Yeah.

29:27.662 --> 29:29.836
If you want a piece of
skate, get to my mate,

29:29.837 --> 29:31.078
I think have I
done it, that's it,

29:31.079 --> 29:33.322
okay let's go, let's
countdown proper.

29:33.323 --> 29:37.844
10, nine, eight, seven.

29:40.813 --> 29:41.641
Happy New Year.

29:42.884 --> 29:45.817
Alright, alright,
everyone calm down,

29:45.818 --> 29:48.406
that's fine, just stay in
doors, don't go outside,

29:48.407 --> 29:50.097
we'll work out what this is.

29:50.098 --> 29:52.273
I'll be back with you
soon, thanks, thanks.

29:56.864 --> 29:57.692
Sorry, sorry.

30:01.213 --> 30:02.041
Stevo.

30:10.256 --> 30:14.363
Oh.

30:19.783 --> 30:21.301
What?

30:21.302 --> 30:23.028
What just happened.

30:36.317 --> 30:37.111
What?

30:40.839 --> 30:42.909
Come in Steve, it
might start up again.

30:42.910 --> 30:46.636
I'm a valley boy Rye,
not afraid of a few drops.

30:46.637 --> 30:48.638
If you're such a
proud valley boy,

30:48.639 --> 30:49.950
how come you changed your accent

30:49.951 --> 30:51.883
the minute you moved to London?

30:51.884 --> 30:52.850
What?

30:52.851 --> 30:54.023
You used to sound like me.

30:54.024 --> 30:55.025
What's up there?

30:57.096 --> 30:58.132
Can you see anything?

31:06.416 --> 31:07.210
Shit!

31:09.005 --> 31:13.180
Fuck me.
Sorry.

31:13.181 --> 31:14.700
Is that a spear?

31:17.634 --> 31:18.462
Maasai.

31:20.050 --> 31:21.292
What?

31:21.293 --> 31:24.365
It's in Ecola, it's
short for close attacks.

31:25.711 --> 31:30.301
African Maasai tribe,
see the blade has

31:30.302 --> 31:31.579
a distinctive fish shape.

31:33.753 --> 31:34.996
Masters in anthropology.

31:36.515 --> 31:37.929
Yeah well don't take it inside,

31:37.930 --> 31:39.311
I've only rented the place.

31:42.314 --> 31:44.936
Sunita, you're
keeping odd hours.

31:44.937 --> 31:46.524
Sorry to disturb you sir.

31:46.525 --> 31:48.043
I take it this
isn't a drink and dial

31:48.044 --> 31:50.562
to say how much you appreciate
me as your new boss.

31:50.563 --> 31:52.496
We may have a
Canary incident sir.

31:55.016 --> 31:56.534
May have a what?

31:56.535 --> 31:58.053
This would make it the
second after Rendlesham sir.

31:58.054 --> 32:00.952
Do not mention Rendlesham.

32:00.953 --> 32:04.024
Rendlesham was a long time ago,
it's probably best forgotten

32:04.025 --> 32:06.233
two soldiers from two
countries disappeared,

32:06.234 --> 32:09.409
we had to tell their families
they died in a train accident.

32:09.410 --> 32:10.997
Oh the Yanks kicked up a fuss.

32:10.998 --> 32:13.309
It has a similar MO
sir, foreign corpse,

32:13.310 --> 32:15.380
sudden impact, no
sign of aircraft.

32:15.381 --> 32:16.657
How can you tell?

32:16.658 --> 32:17.658
It just fell on
the party I'm at.

32:17.659 --> 32:19.108
On the house.

32:19.109 --> 32:20.868
Bit weird in it?

32:20.869 --> 32:21.869
That's putting it mildly.

32:21.870 --> 32:24.182
Oh look at me with my red wine

32:24.183 --> 32:25.943
and my long words.

32:25.944 --> 32:26.978
Have you got a problem mate?

32:26.979 --> 32:28.947
Yeah I fucking have actually.

32:29.844 --> 32:32.259
Why don't we step outside.

32:32.260 --> 32:33.468
We are outside.

32:36.713 --> 32:38.438
And what can you
confirm about the body?

32:38.439 --> 32:41.337
I can't quite yet sir,
it's still on the roof.

32:41.338 --> 32:43.063
It did drop this though.

32:43.064 --> 32:44.306
There's something on the roof

32:44.307 --> 32:45.929
that may or may not be a corpse,

32:47.103 --> 32:48.551
and you have a
funny looking stick.

32:48.552 --> 32:49.863
Sir...
Oh I knew

32:49.864 --> 32:51.554
you should never have
lead me to the Yanks.

32:51.555 --> 32:53.039
They filled your
head with spaceships.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.179
A Viennese boatman dropped
on Rendlesham in 1980,

32:55.180 --> 32:59.079
then disappeared in 96, they
tracked him, definite ID.

32:59.080 --> 33:00.839
Yes, says your
friend Miles Kendrick,

33:00.840 --> 33:03.463
who for some reason only
has a level five clearance.

33:03.464 --> 33:07.501
Sunita listen,
aliens don't exist,

33:07.502 --> 33:09.883
time travel does not exist.

33:09.884 --> 33:10.816
Happy New Year.

33:11.955 --> 33:14.406
Get a towel, you don't
mix red and white...

33:15.752 --> 33:17.028
Oh you're fucking
asking for it pal.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.202
Yeah.

33:18.203 --> 33:19.030
Yeah I'll knock
that little smug look

33:19.031 --> 33:20.273
right off your face.

33:20.274 --> 33:21.067
Alright just back off man.

33:21.068 --> 33:22.171
Yeah you back off.

33:22.172 --> 33:23.724
Huw, Huw mate please.

33:23.725 --> 33:27.280
Oh what so it's fine if
you're a famous fucking DJ

33:27.281 --> 33:29.730
or a rich knob but
if you work in a pub

33:29.731 --> 33:31.180
you can fuck off is it.

33:31.181 --> 33:33.838
He's not gonna give
you his money anyway,

33:33.839 --> 33:37.117
your Valley Club
ideas fucking rubbish.

33:37.118 --> 33:38.395
Fuck!
Fuck!

33:39.914 --> 33:43.849
Fucking hell I'm so
sorry, that was me again.

33:48.888 --> 33:50.131
What is that?

33:53.721 --> 33:56.585
What the fucks going
on here in Wales?

33:56.586 --> 33:57.794
Is this normal?

34:01.522 --> 34:02.350
Fuck sake.

34:20.368 --> 34:21.197
What now?

34:22.888 --> 34:24.199
Observe and report.

34:25.649 --> 34:26.580
That's it?

34:26.581 --> 34:27.617
Orders.

34:28.790 --> 34:30.032
I can't do my
job if I don't know

34:30.033 --> 34:31.239
what the objective is.

34:31.241 --> 34:32.759
You've been told exactly what...

34:32.760 --> 34:34.208
What is your job title?

34:34.210 --> 34:36.280
Same as you, analyst.

34:36.281 --> 34:38.213
Really, you look
like you analyze people

34:38.214 --> 34:39.524
who are tied to a chair.

34:39.525 --> 34:40.594
What are we doing here?

34:40.594 --> 34:44.081
Listen to me.

34:52.435 --> 34:54.436
Can you hear me, hello yeah.

34:54.437 --> 34:58.199
My names Huw Richards, I'm
a barman at the Cross Keys,

34:59.545 --> 35:02.754
that's not important,
look a dead black man

35:02.755 --> 35:05.688
just fell out of the
sky onto my house.

35:05.689 --> 35:08.346
Well it's not actually
my house, I'm renting it,

35:08.347 --> 35:10.417
and also there was
this rain right,

35:10.418 --> 35:12.833
and then it just turned
off like it was a big

35:12.834 --> 35:15.008
fucking tap in the
sky or something.

35:15.009 --> 35:19.186
So can you send coppers,
an ambulance, hello.

35:21.981 --> 35:22.912
Oh I got cut off.

35:22.913 --> 35:23.844
Yeah or they've hung up.

35:23.845 --> 35:25.156
I'll try calling them.

35:25.157 --> 35:26.089
Steve.
Yeah.

35:27.194 --> 35:29.056
I need to make
sure my dad's okay.

35:29.057 --> 35:30.679
No one's going out there
til we know what's going on.

35:30.680 --> 35:32.957
I've seen the body, that's
not gonna hurt me is it?

35:32.958 --> 35:34.441
Yeah but Agnes seriously.

35:34.442 --> 35:36.650
Look, if one of those
has fallen on my dads roof

35:36.651 --> 35:37.721
he's gonna freak out.

35:39.861 --> 35:40.828
I'll go with you.

35:48.422 --> 35:50.112
We should all go,
it could get worse.

35:50.113 --> 35:52.149
Uh, it could get a lot
worse outside actually,

35:52.150 --> 35:53.426
besides we don't want
to see a dead body

35:53.427 --> 35:54.703
thank you very much.

35:54.704 --> 35:56.256
Look the other way
then, scaredy poof.

35:56.257 --> 35:57.533
Do you want a fucking beating?

35:57.534 --> 35:59.259
As if you could.

35:59.260 --> 36:01.088
I'm black belt in Wing Chun.

36:01.089 --> 36:02.987
What's that, fucking
flower arranging.

36:02.988 --> 36:06.232
Boys, Nav what'd they say.

36:06.233 --> 36:07.889
I don't think they believed me.

36:09.270 --> 36:10.926
You're a nutter sis.

36:10.927 --> 36:11.755
We'll be fine.

36:24.492 --> 36:26.390
We stay together,
we stay together.

36:26.391 --> 36:27.805
There's nothing out there.

36:27.806 --> 36:29.220
We stay inside.
There's nothing out there.

36:29.221 --> 36:31.878
Wing Chung
There's nothing out there.

36:31.879 --> 36:33.259
We stay inside.
There's nothing out there.

36:33.260 --> 36:35.330
We stay together.
There's nothing out there.

36:35.331 --> 36:37.539
Win Chung.
We stay inside.

36:37.540 --> 36:39.403
So how do you know Steve?

36:39.404 --> 36:41.301
Is he really
worth talking about?

36:41.302 --> 36:44.304
No actually, what
do you do in London?

36:44.305 --> 36:45.650
Travel agent.

36:45.651 --> 36:46.480
Really?

36:47.343 --> 36:48.550
What about you?

36:48.551 --> 36:49.482
I work for the local paper.

36:49.483 --> 36:51.380
Oh, a journalist.

36:51.381 --> 36:54.212
Councils Binbag
Blunder, hardly Watergate.

36:55.351 --> 36:57.215
I can tell when people
are lying though.

36:59.286 --> 37:00.907
I still can't get signal.

37:00.908 --> 37:02.667
Just gonna check Lisa
hasn't burnt down the B&B.

37:02.668 --> 37:04.117
Your phone is shit.

37:04.118 --> 37:04.945
Where's yours?

37:04.946 --> 37:05.775
In the car.

37:07.501 --> 37:10.883
Be careful it's muddy

37:14.335 --> 37:15.888
Love you.
Yeah whatever.

37:21.135 --> 37:24.931
<i>♪ Are you from Scotland,
nu, I am from Wales. ♪</i>

37:24.932 --> 37:25.967
Alright mate.
Fuck off.

37:30.696 --> 37:32.559
<i>♪ Are you from England, no</i>

37:32.560 --> 37:34.389

37:36.219 --> 37:38.462

37:43.813 --> 37:45.366
Ah there you are.

37:54.341 --> 37:56.203
Got you, you little fucker.

38:06.663 --> 38:07.492
Please!

38:30.653 --> 38:32.688
Do you mind if
I go in on my own,

38:32.689 --> 38:34.207
my dad might be?

38:34.208 --> 38:35.036
Sure.

38:37.384 --> 38:39.108
The
assailant wore a yellow mac...

38:39.109 --> 38:40.317
Dad.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.042
And appears pale and crazed.

38:42.043 --> 38:43.458
I don't think he's
anyone's catch of the day.

38:43.459 --> 38:44.874
Dad, you awake?

38:53.331 --> 38:57.749
Dad.

39:04.480 --> 39:05.343
Dad?

39:15.525 --> 39:20.116
Dad.

39:56.394 --> 40:00.569
Gerrant, come too, it's
a party, it's a party.

40:00.570 --> 40:02.503
Let's get drunk and
make some mistakes.

40:03.987 --> 40:06.300
Slightly inappropriate
time to be taking Es.

40:07.439 --> 40:10.717
NHS, when did you
call the police?

40:10.718 --> 40:11.892
Half an hour ago.

40:13.859 --> 40:16.310
Brilliant, hardly anything.

40:18.795 --> 40:21.073
You know this isn't
exactly how I planned it,

40:22.178 --> 40:23.385
and Huw and everything I...

40:23.386 --> 40:25.629
Did you really used
to sound like him?

40:25.630 --> 40:29.460
Yeah a bit, but
no London station

40:29.461 --> 40:32.221
wants a DJ sounding
like that now do they.

40:32.222 --> 40:33.395
Suni's always sounded the same,

40:33.396 --> 40:35.639
but I grew up
sounding like my mom.

40:35.640 --> 40:39.401
I got picked on big time,
kids doing impressions of me,

40:39.402 --> 40:41.473
they sounded more
Welsh then Indian.

40:42.716 --> 40:44.372
I changed the way
I spoke to fit in,

40:46.064 --> 40:47.548
Suni'd never have cared though.

40:48.756 --> 40:51.172
I suppose that's why I'm
so protective of her.

40:53.761 --> 40:54.831
Not that she needs it.

41:11.227 --> 41:12.676
Pale and crazed.

41:20.961 --> 41:22.513
Pale and crazed.

42:09.009 --> 42:10.699
Getting some
reports on the ground.

42:10.700 --> 42:11.873
We have people there?

42:11.874 --> 42:15.428
Just the local police,
reports of bodies

42:15.429 --> 42:18.294
falling from the sky,
civilians with stab wounds.

42:30.375 --> 42:31.203
Shit.

42:35.483 --> 42:39.245
I want as many feeds as we
can, satellite, HCL, traffic,

42:39.246 --> 42:40.074
whatever we got.

42:41.731 --> 42:45.976
It's a party, it's a
happy, happy New Year party.

42:45.977 --> 42:50.982
2015, and all the
Londoners coming down,

42:52.155 --> 42:54.363
ooh look at me
I've got nice hair

42:54.364 --> 42:55.779
and my sister's fit.

42:55.780 --> 42:56.919
Hey, cork it.

42:58.645 --> 43:00.128
But I haven't
finished my set yet.

43:00.129 --> 43:02.095
Why haven't we
had any complaints?

43:02.096 --> 43:03.338
What?

43:03.339 --> 43:04.892
The neighbors,
and where's Tommy?

43:06.342 --> 43:10.000
I don't know mate, I do not
keep track of all the gays.

43:10.001 --> 43:12.071
I've been working on a
series of adventure novels

43:12.072 --> 43:14.142
about this sort of DJ explorer.

43:14.143 --> 43:15.350
I could write you one.

43:15.351 --> 43:16.765
Have you seen my
waste of a boyfriend?

43:16.766 --> 43:17.836
Not for a while no.

43:19.044 --> 43:21.114
If he's found the
weed in the car.

43:21.115 --> 43:21.944
Thomas.

43:23.773 --> 43:25.671
Maybe I could write
like a chapter where...

43:25.672 --> 43:28.053
Stop talking Steve.
Yeah, happy New Year.

43:30.331 --> 43:32.748
Thomas you found the
fucking hash didn't you?

43:34.888 --> 43:35.716
Thomas!

43:47.038 --> 43:47.866
Fuck.

44:21.900 --> 44:22.729
Come on!

44:54.553 --> 44:56.694
Come on.
What the fuck.

45:18.923 --> 45:19.751
David.

45:29.934 --> 45:32.211
This isn't a true
representation of Valley Palace.

45:32.212 --> 45:33.730
Shut up Steve.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.041
You know, Huw promised me
like 600 guests, honestly.

45:35.042 --> 45:35.871
Shut up Steve.

45:38.011 --> 45:38.942
You alright Sis?

45:38.943 --> 45:40.426
Where's the key for the door?

45:40.427 --> 45:42.704
Something's chasing
us, it just killed Tommy.

45:42.705 --> 45:44.016
Fuck I'm gonna hide, see you.

45:44.017 --> 45:45.812
We need to stay together.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.127
There's nothing out there.

45:52.128 --> 45:53.370
We stay inside.

45:53.371 --> 45:54.889
I don't know what
all the noise is about

45:54.890 --> 45:58.513
but I'm going outside to
get myself some more beer.

46:43.593 --> 46:47.287
<i>♪ I see the rain falling down</i>

47:10.793 --> 47:11.621
Shit.

47:18.594 --> 47:21.252

47:35.128 --> 47:36.232
Shit, shit.

49:03.871 --> 49:06.045
Jesus, fuck off.
What?

49:06.046 --> 49:08.013
This is my hiding
place, fuck off.

49:08.014 --> 49:09.462
Where are I gonna hide?

49:09.463 --> 49:10.498
Not my problem.

49:10.499 --> 49:12.949
I'll give you a fucking
problem, budge up.

49:20.026 --> 49:21.923
Fuck off.
No go.

49:21.924 --> 49:23.857
Jesus, fucking, fuck.

50:15.529 --> 50:18.187
There was a fucking corkscrew.

50:29.543 --> 50:31.890
Come on, come on, come on.

50:35.411 --> 50:39.207
I got him, I got
him, get the spear.

50:39.208 --> 50:40.554
Get the fucking spear.

50:42.798 --> 50:44.248
I can't find it.

50:45.456 --> 50:50.288
I can't hold him,
I can't hold him.

51:17.936 --> 51:18.765
Oh fuck.

51:50.831 --> 51:55.802
Shit.

52:05.950 --> 52:06.882
You cunt.

52:43.850 --> 52:47.681
Fucking touch my
mustache you fucking prick.

52:55.206 --> 52:56.069
Found it.

53:26.272 --> 53:28.377
What the fuck are they?

53:29.551 --> 53:32.761
I don't know, just
want them to go away.

53:40.044 --> 53:41.596
Sunita.
We've been attacked.

53:41.597 --> 53:43.184
If you would like me
to call them terrorists

53:43.185 --> 53:44.565
instead of aliens I will.

53:44.566 --> 53:46.946
I believe you, a
corpse similar to the one

53:46.947 --> 53:49.190
you encountered landed
only two miles from here.

53:49.191 --> 53:52.297
We are in lockdown, I've
got no agents within

53:52.298 --> 53:55.265
a 20 mile radius of you,
but I'm tracking you okay.

53:55.266 --> 53:56.749
I'm tracking you and I've
informed local police.

53:56.750 --> 53:58.303
Police are otherwise
occupied sir.

53:58.304 --> 54:00.995
Sunita listen, listen,
it seems the higher ups

54:00.996 --> 54:03.998
haven't been entirely
honest with either of us.

54:03.999 --> 54:06.691
Rendlesham wasn't
the first incident.

54:18.531 --> 54:21.291
Hey the phone
reception was rubbish

54:21.292 --> 54:23.880
and now it's totally gone
because of the weather right.

54:23.881 --> 54:26.503
That relies on transmissions
through the air.

54:26.504 --> 54:28.402
Internet is mainly
cables underground.

54:28.403 --> 54:31.508
There's no Wi-Fi here, but
I'm picking up a signal

54:31.509 --> 54:33.130
in another house, really faint.

54:33.131 --> 54:35.305
You wanna what,
email the police?

54:35.306 --> 54:36.272
No I want to get hold of someone

54:36.273 --> 54:38.032
who might know all about this.

54:38.033 --> 54:40.966
Oh yeah, like hello we've
been attacked and killed

54:40.967 --> 54:43.348
by vampire fisherman, do
you have an opinion on that.

54:43.349 --> 54:45.004
Only my friend Sunita
thinks it might be

54:45.005 --> 54:46.282
your area of expertise.

54:46.283 --> 54:47.111
Shut up Steve.

54:48.112 --> 54:49.630
Look we all know at this point

54:49.631 --> 54:51.217
that I don't actually work
for a travel agents right.

54:51.218 --> 54:53.910
Yeah, I was wondering
when you were gonna tell me.

54:53.911 --> 54:55.050
So what are you then?

54:56.741 --> 54:57.570
MOD.

54:59.365 --> 55:00.917
You've got a Masters
of Interior Design?

55:00.918 --> 55:03.264
Ministry of Defense
you fucking knob,

55:03.265 --> 55:04.748
where's the I in that?

55:04.749 --> 55:07.406
Piss off, do I look like
I belong in a spy thriller?

55:07.407 --> 55:09.926
No, no I don't, no my job is,

55:09.927 --> 55:11.548
and hopefully will
still be to provide

55:11.549 --> 55:13.688
quality and slightly
adult entertainment

55:13.689 --> 55:16.622
to an impressively large
number of London listeners.

55:16.623 --> 55:19.073
And yes, actually, I
did think that working

55:19.074 --> 55:21.040
in a travel agents was
beneath Sunita's skill

55:21.041 --> 55:23.215
and intelligence level but I
didn't want to point that out,

55:23.216 --> 55:25.700
did I, no because I
thought it might be rude.

55:25.701 --> 55:27.219
As opposed to
suggesting that you, me,

55:27.220 --> 55:29.670
and the girl from the radio
station have a threesome.

55:29.671 --> 55:31.672
What!
No, no, no.

55:31.673 --> 55:32.914
No I didn't say that.

55:32.915 --> 55:34.709
Yes you did, you
just don't remember.

55:34.710 --> 55:36.332
I will destroy you.

55:36.333 --> 55:38.506
Off topic, off
topic, slightly fucking

55:38.507 --> 55:40.923
off topic everyone. Tah!

55:42.718 --> 55:45.617
So, Ministry of Defense.

55:45.618 --> 55:47.998
Field agent, I was
on loan to the Yanks,

55:47.999 --> 55:50.242
there's someone over there,
an American version of me

55:50.243 --> 55:52.451
but a bit more senior, he's
the guy I need to get hold of.

55:52.452 --> 55:53.832
Right so we email him?

55:53.833 --> 55:55.627
I can try and secure a web cam,

55:55.628 --> 55:57.353
DOD scrambles the
signal well enough

55:57.354 --> 55:58.492
so no one can peek in.

55:58.493 --> 56:00.356
So we can Skype him then?

56:00.357 --> 56:01.771
Only in a top
secret sort of way.

56:01.772 --> 56:02.979
Yeah.

56:02.980 --> 56:04.671
Great, who's got a laptop?

56:05.672 --> 56:07.259
I have.

56:07.260 --> 56:08.847
Where is it?

56:14.785 --> 56:15.992
Why didn't you bring it inside?

56:15.993 --> 56:18.201
Who brings a laptop to a party?

56:18.202 --> 56:19.927
Besides we need to get to
where the wireless signal

56:19.928 --> 56:22.308
is strong enough,
wherever this house is.

56:22.309 --> 56:24.795
Let's look, pinkywoofwoof85,

56:27.453 --> 56:29.695
that's Lisa Bevan's house,
it's only a little walk away.

56:29.696 --> 56:30.903
How far is a little walk?

56:30.904 --> 56:32.629
Not long, probably
will feel longer

56:32.630 --> 56:34.044
in this context though.

56:34.045 --> 56:35.701
Why can't you just
webcam him from your phone?

56:35.702 --> 56:37.323
Because the signals
not strong enough,

56:37.324 --> 56:38.842
it doesn't have a
booster like the laptop.

56:38.843 --> 56:39.672
Great.

56:41.363 --> 56:43.882
Alright, me and Nav
go, you two stay behind.

56:43.883 --> 56:46.298
Well I should go,
we'll get there quicker.

56:46.299 --> 56:48.024
Which leaves me here
alone, so no thanks,

56:48.025 --> 56:48.956
I'll come as well please.

56:48.957 --> 56:49.888
Yeah, but someone has to stay

56:49.889 --> 56:50.923
and hold down the fort Steve.

56:50.924 --> 56:52.097
This isn't a fort.

56:52.098 --> 56:53.512
You know what I mean.
This is a rented

56:53.513 --> 56:54.962
holiday cottage which
I've almost certainly

56:54.963 --> 56:56.273
lost my deposit on.
Oh for fuck sake Steve.

56:56.274 --> 56:58.035
Alright, we all go.

56:59.416 --> 57:00.657
I go to the car first with Nav,

57:00.658 --> 57:02.348
Steve and Ryan you stay
behind, keep a look out,

57:02.349 --> 57:03.591
give us the all clear.

57:03.592 --> 57:05.179
Then Steve you join us
at the car, then Ryan.

57:05.180 --> 57:06.767
Two and one, one
cover formation,

57:06.768 --> 57:09.149
then we find this house
with a signal understood.

57:10.496 --> 57:15.466
Yeah.
Yeah.

57:24.441 --> 57:25.269
Clear.

57:35.762 --> 57:37.074
I'm sorry about Tommy.

57:40.042 --> 57:43.080
I was on the rebound with
him, he wasn't the one.

57:44.978 --> 57:47.084
I feel a bit bad that
I don't feel badder.

57:48.982 --> 57:51.882
Probably just the shock or
something, I don't know.

57:54.160 --> 57:55.850
I'm sure you'll
meet someone nice.

57:55.851 --> 57:58.439
I did meet a bloke
actually, down the pub.

57:58.440 --> 58:01.891
He looked a bit, I'll tell
you some other time shall I.

58:01.892 --> 58:06.897
Yeah.

58:09.865 --> 58:11.902
Oh for, yeah that's
brilliant that is.

58:14.387 --> 58:15.215
Hurry up.

58:16.665 --> 58:17.494
Yeah alright!

58:28.608 --> 58:30.954
Got the keys.
Chuck them then.

58:30.955 --> 58:31.784
Jesus.

58:34.200 --> 58:35.684
One, two, three.

58:40.447 --> 58:42.104
The fuck was that?

58:48.214 --> 58:52.321
Steven Dennis did this.

58:53.840 --> 58:58.120
You tell that little
shit he's under arrest.

59:26.148 --> 59:27.977
What's that?

59:27.978 --> 59:29.772
Oh it's so that I can
see and keep my hands free

59:29.773 --> 59:30.669
for fighting.

59:30.670 --> 59:31.775
You look like a tit.

59:33.086 --> 59:34.674
I'll be the tit who survives.

01:00:11.677 --> 01:00:14.126
Here we are, this is it.

01:00:14.127 --> 01:00:16.577
It's a post office.

01:00:16.578 --> 01:00:17.614
They live upstairs.

01:00:47.816 --> 01:00:50.543
You guys stay down here,
Steve and I will check upstairs.

01:01:30.169 --> 01:01:31.583
The signals strongest up here,

01:01:31.584 --> 01:01:34.000
I'm gonna try
calling, keep watch.

01:01:38.591 --> 01:01:40.212
Alright look away,
I'm entering passwords

01:01:40.213 --> 01:01:41.731
protected by the
official secrets act.

01:01:41.732 --> 01:01:43.491
Stop showing off,
I wouldn't let you

01:01:43.492 --> 01:01:45.943
see my pin number, it's
basically the same thing.

01:01:47.669 --> 01:01:49.566
Give me any DOD satellite
we have in the area,

01:01:49.567 --> 01:01:50.809
I need as much coverage of

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:53.778
I need to take this.

01:01:53.779 --> 01:01:55.676
The cloud cover has
grown to twice it's size.

01:01:55.677 --> 01:01:57.091
I'll be as fast as I can.

01:01:57.092 --> 01:01:59.128
It's spreading.

01:01:59.129 --> 01:02:01.095
It's what?
Cloud cover.

01:02:01.096 --> 01:02:02.097
It's moving outward.

01:02:03.443 --> 01:02:05.444
They wanted us to see this.

01:02:05.445 --> 01:02:06.998
Shock and awe.

01:02:06.999 --> 01:02:07.793
What?

01:02:08.794 --> 01:02:11.209
You don't just attack somebody,

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:13.004
you show them what
you can do first.

01:02:13.005 --> 01:02:14.868
You rattle them, you scare them,

01:02:14.869 --> 01:02:17.526
then when you do go in,
they're not fighting back,

01:02:18.458 --> 01:02:19.459
they're negotiating.

01:02:30.608 --> 01:02:31.850
He may not answer.

01:02:31.851 --> 01:02:33.439
Anything's worth a
shot at this point.

01:02:40.032 --> 01:02:41.722
Sunita.
Miles.

01:02:41.723 --> 01:02:42.930
Is this secure?

01:02:42.931 --> 01:02:44.104
I tried calling,
all phones are out.

01:02:44.105 --> 01:02:45.208
What are we looking at?

01:02:45.209 --> 01:02:46.451
I can't tell you.

01:02:46.452 --> 01:02:47.624
Which means you know,
that's why you didn't

01:02:47.625 --> 01:02:48.453
return my calls.

01:02:48.454 --> 01:02:49.972
Trust me I wanted too.

01:02:49.973 --> 01:02:51.939
We're getting
slaughtered here Miles.

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:55.080
Men in raincoats,
discolored skin, they can...

01:02:55.081 --> 01:02:56.358
Did they look like this?

01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:01.398
Who are they?

01:03:02.848 --> 01:03:04.572
Crew of a fishing boat,
disappeared from an island

01:03:04.573 --> 01:03:06.022
in Massachusetts two years ago,

01:03:06.023 --> 01:03:09.819
they may have been replicated.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:10.993
What cloned?

01:03:10.994 --> 01:03:12.546
It's possible,
I've seen it myself.

01:03:12.547 --> 01:03:14.306
You could have given
me some kind of warning,

01:03:14.307 --> 01:03:15.721
tell your friends to
stay out of Wales,

01:03:15.722 --> 01:03:16.653
something like that.

01:03:16.654 --> 01:03:18.414
You were meant to be there.

01:03:18.415 --> 01:03:20.416
What are you talking about?

01:03:20.417 --> 01:03:22.419
This was sent to us in 2012.

01:03:23.558 --> 01:03:25.145
Hey that's me, that
was taken tonight,

01:03:25.146 --> 01:03:26.353
how did you get that?

01:03:26.354 --> 01:03:27.526
You shouldn't be
talking to me Steven.

01:03:27.527 --> 01:03:28.976
He's right, you
shouldn't see his face.

01:03:28.977 --> 01:03:31.220
Yeah too late, who are
you, how'd you know my name?

01:03:31.221 --> 01:03:32.428
Who is this knob?

01:03:32.429 --> 01:03:34.361
Ex colleague,
tell us about them,

01:03:34.362 --> 01:03:35.569
we need to know everything.

01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:36.812
We don't know what they are,

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:38.261
but we know they're
doing experiments

01:03:38.262 --> 01:03:39.953
and they've contacted us.

01:03:39.954 --> 01:03:40.817
How?

01:03:41.956 --> 01:03:43.232
Don't bother it's
classified isn't it.

01:03:43.233 --> 01:03:44.681
I shouldn't even
be talking to you.

01:03:44.682 --> 01:03:46.269
Yeah listen mate, you're
US government right.

01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:47.823
One small section,
a section that doesn't

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:49.065
officially exist but yes.

01:03:49.066 --> 01:03:50.446
Whatever you can help us okay,

01:03:50.447 --> 01:03:53.242
I want you to send
helicopters, jets, anything,

01:03:53.243 --> 01:03:54.484
better still...

01:03:54.485 --> 01:03:55.590
We've been ordered
to observe and report.

01:03:56.487 --> 01:03:57.522
Nothing more.

01:03:57.523 --> 01:04:00.007
Un-fucking-believable.
What?

01:04:00.008 --> 01:04:01.733
Look, this is above my pay grade

01:04:01.734 --> 01:04:03.493
but it seems a deal
has been struck.

01:04:03.494 --> 01:04:04.736
They get to do their experiments

01:04:04.737 --> 01:04:07.946
anyway but the US
and we let them.

01:04:07.947 --> 01:04:11.191
In exchange they do us no
harm, and they stay away.

01:04:11.192 --> 01:04:14.159
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, what about

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.403
our special relationship?

01:04:18.164 --> 01:04:19.993
The way you need to look at it,

01:04:19.994 --> 01:04:24.273
and I mean this, we're
not good enough for you.

01:04:24.274 --> 01:04:26.447
Our two countries may
have allied for a time,

01:04:26.448 --> 01:04:27.966
but you always knew that
we were both in this

01:04:27.967 --> 01:04:31.245
for our own gain, I
guess you could say

01:04:31.246 --> 01:04:33.523
it was fun while it lasted.

01:04:33.524 --> 01:04:36.768
Now we've clarified
that, any handy hints.

01:04:36.769 --> 01:04:37.596
The rain.

01:04:37.597 --> 01:04:38.528
What about it?

01:04:38.529 --> 01:04:39.909
Every time these events occur,

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:41.600
there's always
been a rain storm.

01:04:41.601 --> 01:04:43.637
We had the labs
analyze the liquid,

01:04:43.638 --> 01:04:46.674
it's not water, not
strictly speaking.

01:04:46.675 --> 01:04:48.400
Some of the chemicals
that we found are...

01:04:48.401 --> 01:04:50.333
Look we haven't
got much time so.

01:04:50.334 --> 01:04:53.440
The fisherman are the first
humans to come down alive,

01:04:53.441 --> 01:04:55.545
if you can call that,
they had the same liquid

01:04:55.546 --> 01:04:57.582
in their lungs and in
their bloodstreams.

01:04:57.583 --> 01:05:00.550
They're prototypes,
like baby sharks,

01:05:00.551 --> 01:05:01.966
still learning how to kill.

01:05:01.967 --> 01:05:04.865
And you better move fast
because they will adapt.

01:05:04.866 --> 01:05:06.315
So they've been injecting people

01:05:06.316 --> 01:05:07.523
and now they've perfected
the dose they're sending them

01:05:07.524 --> 01:05:09.042
down to kill us.

01:05:09.043 --> 01:05:10.698
We hadn't confirmed that
that was their intention.

01:05:10.699 --> 01:05:13.184
Yes it is, I can state
100% for the record

01:05:13.185 --> 01:05:15.462
that it is, it's bloody
is, it's confirmed.

01:05:15.463 --> 01:05:17.774
They are alien human
hybrid killing machines.

01:05:17.775 --> 01:05:19.569
This guys a real wanker did
you used to go out with him?

01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:21.813
I can hear you
man, I am right here.

01:05:21.814 --> 01:05:23.228
I wish you were right
here, I'd fucking...

01:05:23.229 --> 01:05:24.678
You'd what, DJ me to death?

01:05:24.679 --> 01:05:26.645
Oh you are so bloody dead.

01:05:26.646 --> 01:05:28.095
Boys!

01:05:28.096 --> 01:05:29.545
Look I have to go, this
call will have been monitored.

01:05:29.546 --> 01:05:30.718
If it were up to me...

01:05:30.719 --> 01:05:31.858
But it's not.

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:36.621
No, good luck.

01:05:36.622 --> 01:05:39.176
Yeah I'm never eating another
hot dog again, fuck off.

01:05:47.012 --> 01:05:49.254
The storm front's covering
most of Wales at this point.

01:05:49.255 --> 01:05:51.153
You can see the other
weather is moving north east

01:05:51.154 --> 01:05:54.053
with the wind, but this is
just hovering, it's static.

01:05:55.917 --> 01:05:56.918
What do you think?

01:05:58.195 --> 01:06:00.025
I think we're
approaching plan B.

01:06:04.684 --> 01:06:07.342
I made a new years resolution
to stop eating these.

01:06:09.689 --> 01:06:11.104
What is that?

01:06:11.105 --> 01:06:14.453
It's a tennis racket
with knives in it.

01:06:26.189 --> 01:06:27.466
Sis, we've got to go.

01:06:29.951 --> 01:06:31.469
Whoa, what about your laptop.

01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:32.609
Not a laptop anymore.

01:06:37.648 --> 01:06:39.305
Alright, out the back, no noise.

01:07:10.474 --> 01:07:12.441
What the hell is that?

01:07:12.442 --> 01:07:14.029
It's a tennis racket
with knives in it.

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:14.857
You'll have someone's eye out.

01:07:14.858 --> 01:07:16.376
That's the idea.

01:07:16.377 --> 01:07:17.378
I'm older then you.

01:07:18.862 --> 01:07:21.450
Why aren't they
crossing, is it the water?

01:07:21.451 --> 01:07:22.865
Are they allergic to it?

01:07:22.866 --> 01:07:25.799
Rain coats, whatever
liquid they were using

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.526
it was too strong and
people came down dead.

01:07:28.527 --> 01:07:30.079
Like the African man.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.426
They were overdosing
them, but the raincoats

01:07:32.427 --> 01:07:34.670
protected them just enough
and now their test subjects

01:07:34.671 --> 01:07:37.811
are surviving they're
giving them to everyone.

01:07:37.812 --> 01:07:39.986
Like armor, or a condom.

01:07:41.264 --> 01:07:43.886
You know for me,
it's that photograph.

01:07:43.887 --> 01:07:45.888
The fact that it
was taken tonight

01:07:45.889 --> 01:07:48.235
but the American's
had it two years ago.

01:07:48.236 --> 01:07:49.754
Forget all that other
freaky shit we've seen,

01:07:49.755 --> 01:07:52.551
it's that that gives me the
willies more then anything else.

01:08:00.697 --> 01:08:01.491
Fuck.

01:08:05.322 --> 01:08:06.151
Guys.

01:08:10.569 --> 01:08:12.259
Does this ever come to an end?

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:14.573
I, I don't know, I just remember
coming here to get drunk.

01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:18.093
Any ideas.

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:19.647
This is usually when
we call for air support.

01:08:24.893 --> 01:08:27.309
You know what we used to
do when we were in school

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:29.448
and someone would
make fun of you.

01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:31.590
You'd look at the
bastard, remember.

01:08:34.524 --> 01:08:39.529
You'd look in his ugly face
and you'd fucking charge.

01:08:40.357 --> 01:08:41.287
Don't be stupid.

01:08:41.288 --> 01:08:42.669
Naveen!

01:08:42.670 --> 01:08:43.497
Come on!

01:08:52.749 --> 01:08:54.578
Come on you fuckers!

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:01.618
Steve I've decided not to
invest in your Valley's

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:04.069
club scheme, it's
a rubbish idea.

01:09:04.069 --> 01:09:04.725
No!

01:09:05.693 --> 01:09:08.694
Suni, take care of
Steve, he's an idiot.

01:09:08.696 --> 01:09:09.524
Naveen!

01:09:13.459 --> 01:09:15.943
Naveen!
Leave him, it's too late.

01:09:15.944 --> 01:09:17.497
Come on.
Naveen!

01:09:39.071 --> 01:09:40.313
Suni come on.

01:09:40.314 --> 01:09:41.693
Let me stay, Steve.
I can buy you some time.

01:09:41.694 --> 01:09:43.247
No Suni, come on listen.

01:09:43.247 --> 01:09:44.731
Let go.

01:09:44.732 --> 01:09:47.147
Suni Nav stayed so we
don't have too, now come on.

01:09:47.148 --> 01:09:48.218
Get up there.

01:10:04.476 --> 01:10:07.063
I gotta join a gym,
I gotta join a gym,

01:10:07.064 --> 01:10:08.618
I gotta join a gym.

01:10:25.911 --> 01:10:29.155
Steve, Steve!

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:34.437
No benefit, no, no, it
won't make any difference.

01:10:47.519 --> 01:10:48.313
Steve!

01:10:50.349 --> 01:10:51.177
Steve!

01:10:54.629 --> 01:10:56.078
What happened?

01:10:56.079 --> 01:10:58.288
Nothing, I fell, come on.

01:11:15.788 --> 01:11:17.238
Oh for fuck sake.

01:11:28.214 --> 01:11:29.043
Alright then.

01:11:34.013 --> 01:11:35.704
So what time
shall I pick you up?

01:11:35.705 --> 01:11:37.534
What?
For tea.

01:11:38.742 --> 01:11:40.329
I'm gonna take you
for tea tomorrow,

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:41.848
there's a great
place in Llandilo

01:11:41.849 --> 01:11:43.677
that does tea and cakes.

01:11:43.678 --> 01:11:45.230
Sounds nice.

01:11:45.231 --> 01:11:47.163
It really is, it's brilliant.

01:11:47.164 --> 01:11:48.510
Really strong Earl Gray.

01:11:48.511 --> 01:11:49.959
I'm more of a Darjeeling girl.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.134
Uh, they do that as well.

01:11:52.135 --> 01:11:52.963
So what time?

01:11:54.171 --> 01:11:56.380
Shall we say 10,
I'd like a lie in.

01:11:56.381 --> 01:11:58.624
Okay, 10s good.

01:11:59.901 --> 01:12:01.558
Let's deal with
this first shall we.

01:12:26.652 --> 01:12:29.240
Sunita Chowdra.
Yeah.

01:12:29.241 --> 01:12:30.449
Come with me.

01:12:34.867 --> 01:12:35.696
Come on.

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.840
Fuck.

01:12:42.841 --> 01:12:44.635
Hold this will you.

01:12:49.606 --> 01:12:54.403
You're not MOD, black ops, CIA?

01:12:54.404 --> 01:12:57.614
Special branch, I'm
a friend of a friend.

01:13:18.704 --> 01:13:23.398
Mr. Kendrick you've been
assigned back out in the field,

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:25.020
they've sent someone
else here to supervise.

01:13:25.021 --> 01:13:26.780
Someone higher up you mean.

01:13:26.781 --> 01:13:28.265
They're not telling us anything.

01:13:29.646 --> 01:13:31.096
Take care of yourself.

01:13:48.493 --> 01:13:49.735
That's gonna cost you.

01:13:54.637 --> 01:13:56.154
I thought we agreed
to meet in private.

01:13:56.155 --> 01:13:58.225
Oh I can't think of
any place more private

01:13:58.226 --> 01:13:59.952
then a hotel owned by the DOD.

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.993
Saving the girl
has altered things.

01:14:07.097 --> 01:14:09.065
We had requested
that you not do that.

01:14:10.238 --> 01:14:11.894
You requested that
we change nothing

01:14:11.895 --> 01:14:14.483
in the United
States and in return

01:14:14.484 --> 01:14:15.622
that you would not
conduct anymore

01:14:15.623 --> 01:14:17.693
of your experiments here.

01:14:17.694 --> 01:14:18.523
Yes.

01:14:20.007 --> 01:14:21.664
Seems like we're both liars.

01:14:23.148 --> 01:14:24.494
Takes one to know one.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.602
I have a report here of
storms and bodies in Hawaii.

01:14:29.603 --> 01:14:31.500
Oh that didn't have to happen.

01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:33.053
I thought everything
had to happen,

01:14:33.054 --> 01:14:34.710
you've seen it happen.

01:14:34.711 --> 01:14:39.095
This is just one
possible outcome.

01:14:41.062 --> 01:14:42.270
You end up as me.

01:14:43.444 --> 01:14:46.585
Let's be clear, you are not me.

01:14:47.759 --> 01:14:50.727
You have my body,
the rest of you,

01:14:52.315 --> 01:14:53.626
God knows what that is.

01:14:53.627 --> 01:14:55.731
God has nothing to do with this,

01:14:55.732 --> 01:14:58.735
you know those people in
the temples had it right.

01:15:00.219 --> 01:15:02.497
What did you call them,
the ones that drew

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:06.811
all those maps, they predicted
a cleansing rain would come

01:15:06.812 --> 01:15:08.158
and wash the world away.

01:15:10.195 --> 01:15:12.437
The Mayans, that's it.

01:15:12.438 --> 01:15:14.855
The last people who
used the word cleansing

01:15:15.752 --> 01:15:17.513
we kicked their ass.

01:15:18.962 --> 01:15:21.136
My superiors may think that
they can negotiate with you

01:15:21.137 --> 01:15:23.208
but I know a take
over when I see one.

01:15:30.008 --> 01:15:30.871
We're not done.

01:15:32.217 --> 01:15:34.081
It won't make any difference.

01:16:00.072 --> 01:16:01.521
The government has declared

01:16:01.522 --> 01:16:04.317
a state of emergency,
inbound and outbound flights

01:16:04.318 --> 01:16:07.458
too and from the UK
canceled indefinitely.

01:16:07.459 --> 01:16:09.978
Civilians are encouraged
to remain indoors

01:16:09.979 --> 01:16:12.877
or proceed to emergency
rendezvous locations.

01:16:12.878 --> 01:16:15.397
Those with any military
or combat experience

01:16:15.398 --> 01:16:18.469
are encouraged to make
contact with the armed forces.

01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:21.265
If you can please volunteer.

01:16:21.266 --> 01:16:23.474
Britain has repelled
invasion before,

01:16:23.475 --> 01:16:24.787
and it will do so again.

01:16:25.891 --> 01:16:27.652
We shall fight on.

01:16:32.553 --> 01:16:33.657
Can you get us somewhere safe?

01:16:33.658 --> 01:16:38.075
No, there's
nowhere safe anymore,

01:16:38.076 --> 01:16:39.664
we'll have to fight our way out.

01:16:42.528 --> 01:16:44.496

That's an affirmative Griff,

01:19:58.863 --> 01:20:00.139
returning to base
with four survivors,

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:02.003

01:20:07.319 --> 01:20:09.010
Yeah, I've found two soldiers,

01:20:09.011 --> 01:20:11.909
one British, one American,
pretty out of it.

01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:15.602
They said they were in a
forest at night in England,

01:20:15.603 --> 01:20:18.433
five minutes ago, I asked
them what year it is,

01:20:18.434 --> 01:20:21.298
they say it's 1980.

01:20:21.299 --> 01:20:23.957
