00:01.697 --> 00:03.331
What have you told them
about their father?

00:03.365 --> 00:05.249
<i>Don't they have a right</i>
<i>to know that he's alive?</i>

00:05.284 --> 00:06.868
We are never, ever
going to tell anyone.

00:06.902 --> 00:09.370
- What happened between you and Killian?
- We kissed.

00:09.371 --> 00:12.258
One man is your soul mate,
the other man is your destroyer.

00:12.259 --> 00:13.211
Freya.

00:13.212 --> 00:15.991
MIKE: I'm actually looking for
something more about the occult...

00:15.992 --> 00:17.568
Witchcraft,
curses, spirits.

00:17.569 --> 00:19.843
It appears to be made of
some sort of osseous tissue.

00:19.844 --> 00:23.430
There's an entire wall of <i>Ramus Mortium</i>
in the catacombs of Fair Haven.

00:23.464 --> 00:26.049
Who the hell are you?

00:27.986 --> 00:29.490
Thank you, Freya...

00:30.629 --> 00:32.564
- FREYA: My powers are gone.
- What?

00:40.548 --> 00:43.516
JOANNA:
With body, spirit, and soul,

00:43.551 --> 00:47.066
this child again becomes whole.

00:47.665 --> 00:49.299

01:27.628 --> 01:29.880
(sighs) It didn't work.

01:31.452 --> 01:34.421
Maybe this isn't
a spell we can break.

01:34.422 --> 01:37.542
Freya, your powers
aren't just blocked.

01:37.571 --> 01:39.739
- They're gone, Freya.
- What, forever?

01:39.757 --> 01:42.759
And you think the shifter
is the one who took them?

01:42.794 --> 01:46.974
The tarot said the shifter wasn't
powerful enough to come at us directly.

01:47.037 --> 01:50.724
But if the shifter has taken Freya's
powers, everything has changed.

01:50.725 --> 01:53.212
- They're getting stronger.
- How strong?

01:53.213 --> 01:56.399
- As strong as we are.
- If not more.

01:57.414 --> 01:58.881
(thunder cracks)

02:01.385 --> 02:04.154
Please tell me you did that
for dramatic effect.

02:04.188 --> 02:06.689
Things are
getting serious.

02:06.723 --> 02:08.775
(thunder cracks)

02:10.860 --> 02:14.730
Don't worry, ladies,
it's almost over.

Season 1, Episode 9
"A Parching Imbued"

02:23.336 --> 02:25.120
FREYA:
What's happening?

02:25.154 --> 02:27.823
- JOANNA: Oh, we found a spell.
- To get my powers back?

02:27.841 --> 02:31.223
No, but it'll help us work out
who the shifter is.

02:31.224 --> 02:33.810
- How?
- Every time a witch casts a spell,

02:33.811 --> 02:37.677
it leaves a kind of signature,
like a magic fingerprint.

02:37.678 --> 02:41.186
- Oh, what does that mean?
- Just think of it as DNA evidence.

02:41.187 --> 02:44.922
Exactly, so the shifter's fingerprint
may still be traceable

02:44.923 --> 02:46.642
in your blood, so we're gonna
try and draw it out.

02:46.676 --> 02:48.877
- Give me your hand.
- Oh...

02:48.895 --> 02:50.011
(inhales sharply)

02:50.029 --> 02:51.847
- Oh!
- This may hurt a little.

02:51.865 --> 02:54.283
Ow!
Oh, my G... a little?

02:54.317 --> 02:56.972
(gasps) Ow, oh, my God.

02:56.973 --> 02:58.840
All right, that's enough.
(groans)

02:59.022 --> 03:01.073
Oh, my God.

03:01.374 --> 03:02.958
<i>Consuo.</i>

03:02.992 --> 03:07.527
God, I really miss being
able to do things like that.

03:07.528 --> 03:09.381
Aw, I know, honey.

03:09.415 --> 03:12.385
Okay, one more time, take us
through the day you lost them.

03:12.386 --> 03:15.828
- And don't leave anything out.
- Okay, so I was at work,

03:15.829 --> 03:20.398
I had flowers delivered to me, and
I started to feel strange, really sick,

03:20.399 --> 03:22.849
and then I went back
to Fair Haven with Penelope,

03:22.850 --> 03:26.012
and I passed out, and then
Dash showed up and saved me.

03:26.354 --> 03:29.318
I know you think it's the flowers,
but maybe it's something else...

03:29.352 --> 03:32.006
- Penelope, Dash.
- What? Come on.

03:32.007 --> 03:34.156
No, I told you, I tested
Dash a long time ago.

03:34.190 --> 03:37.042
He's mortal, it is not him,
and the same with Penelope.

03:37.043 --> 03:40.356
- They're fine.
- I'm sorry, you tested Dash? Why?

03:40.357 --> 03:43.045
You guys got engaged so quickly

03:43.046 --> 03:45.078
and you kept talking
about this mystical love.

03:45.084 --> 03:47.582
I had to be sure he was
who he said he was.

03:47.583 --> 03:51.274
He's my soul mate. We are destined.
Come on, you read my tarot.

03:51.275 --> 03:55.761
The tarot said he might be, but he could
also be the trickster, your destroyer.

03:55.795 --> 03:59.128
Okay, Dash did not do this.
It is not possible.

03:59.129 --> 04:00.498
I agree.

04:01.848 --> 04:04.883
Okay, I have to go to work.

04:08.673 --> 04:10.600
When did you test Penelope?

04:10.601 --> 04:11.868
- I didn't.
- What?

04:11.869 --> 04:14.279
But she's coming for
the rehearsal dinner tonight.

04:14.280 --> 04:17.709
We can test her then to be sure
and all of the other guests.

04:17.711 --> 04:19.445
Yeah.

04:30.496 --> 04:32.781
I'm sorry that you won't
be coming to the wedding

04:32.799 --> 04:34.950
or the rehearsal
dinner.

04:34.968 --> 04:38.197
- I think it's best.
- I couldn't agree more.

04:38.198 --> 04:40.889
Dash just needs some time.

04:40.924 --> 04:45.221
That doesn't matter. I'm past that.
I was getting antsy here anyway.

04:45.222 --> 04:47.356
Going to Costa Rica
for the winter.

04:47.390 --> 04:49.942
You know I can't spend
too long in one place.

04:49.976 --> 04:52.707
Can't we please discuss
this after the wedding?

04:52.708 --> 04:57.696
Made up my mind, Mom.
I'm going tomorrow afternoon.

04:58.525 --> 05:01.226
I promise to write
this time.

05:05.492 --> 05:07.493
(sighs)

05:38.297 --> 05:40.624
- You know there is one more spell...
- No.

05:40.625 --> 05:42.710
- You didn't know what I was going to say.
- You were going to say

05:42.711 --> 05:44.879
that I should call Victor to see
if he'll get Freya's powers back.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.136
No, I wasn't...

05:46.137 --> 05:49.234
- But you should.
- There's no way...

05:49.235 --> 05:53.405
- The spell could work, Jo.
- And it could not. There's no guarantee.

05:53.406 --> 05:56.064
Victor is a doctor, I'm sure
he knows how to do it safely.

05:56.065 --> 05:58.700
I'm sorry, it's just not
worth taking the risk.

06:04.551 --> 06:07.137
It's a little
monochromatic.

06:07.272 --> 06:08.906
What does it mean?

06:08.907 --> 06:11.924
This is the first time
I've ever done this spell,

06:11.942 --> 06:13.526
but according
to the Grimoire,

06:13.560 --> 06:16.612
the fingerprint slowly
rises to the surface,

06:16.646 --> 06:19.899
and hopefully we'll know
who our enemy is.

06:22.235 --> 06:23.604
FREYA:
Here you go.

06:32.118 --> 06:33.417
Is that it?

06:33.418 --> 06:34.835
(gasps)

06:36.833 --> 06:38.751
Oh.

06:38.785 --> 06:41.453
You look unbelievable.

06:41.471 --> 06:44.644
- Really...?
- It's perfect. You look perfect.

06:44.645 --> 06:47.333
- Everything is perfect.
- Everything is <i>not</i> perfect.

06:47.334 --> 06:50.622
There's a shape-shifter moving in
on us and I've lost my powers.

06:50.623 --> 06:52.484
Mom and Wendy
will handle the shifter,

06:52.499 --> 06:56.986
and I know
this may sound, um...

06:56.987 --> 07:00.639
Have you ever thought that losing
your powers is actually for the best?

07:00.657 --> 07:02.241
Um, no.

07:02.275 --> 07:04.309
Ever since you found out
who you are,

07:04.327 --> 07:06.646
you've been tortured because
you couldn't tell Dash.

07:06.663 --> 07:09.815
- You hated lying to him, right?
- Of course, but...

07:09.833 --> 07:11.784
Now you don't have
to lie anymore.

07:11.818 --> 07:14.276
- You are who you are.
- No.

07:14.394 --> 07:19.291
I feel wrong, empty,
like I'm missing a piece of myself.

07:20.308 --> 07:22.443
KILLIAN:
Hey, it's getting pretty...

07:25.015 --> 07:27.016
(chuckles) Wow.

07:28.685 --> 07:32.888
I will meet you
back out there.

07:39.127 --> 07:42.095
I guess you didn't get the
memo about Casual Friday.

07:42.096 --> 07:44.714
I was just trying it on.

07:45.719 --> 07:48.537
I'm getting married tomorrow.
We moved up the wedding.

07:48.571 --> 07:50.039
Yeah, I know, I heard.

07:50.073 --> 07:52.347
I know I probably should
have said something to you.

07:52.348 --> 07:54.960
I've just been
really busy and planning

07:54.995 --> 07:57.223
and getting everything
together at the last minute

07:57.247 --> 07:59.865
with the food, the flowers,
the honeymoon...

07:59.883 --> 08:04.570
We're going to Paris, which should be
really fun. I'm rambling, aren't I?

08:04.571 --> 08:06.572
- Yep, I am.
- Ah, just a little.

08:06.597 --> 08:08.054
Yeah...

08:09.219 --> 08:11.604
Anyway, we just didn't want
to wait anymore.

08:11.638 --> 08:13.973
I guess when you know,
you know.

08:18.617 --> 08:21.864
Well, congratulations.
I think it's all gonna be great.

08:21.899 --> 08:23.616
Thank you, Killian.

08:23.650 --> 08:27.570
Okay, I will see
you out there.

08:27.604 --> 08:29.772
Oh, but I'd get changed
first if I were you.

08:29.970 --> 08:31.559
Yeah.

08:45.639 --> 08:47.623
Amy, it's Dash.

08:47.641 --> 08:51.477
Listen, I'm down in the catacombs
again, and those branches are gone,

08:51.511 --> 08:53.930
but there's
a strange liquid metal here now.

08:53.964 --> 08:57.154
You want to meet me here
around, say, 3:00

08:57.155 --> 08:59.569
so you can take a look at this
and give me your expert opinion?

08:59.603 --> 09:01.209
All right, thanks.

09:16.552 --> 09:18.741
MIKE: I've been
looking for you.

09:18.780 --> 09:21.065
I'm a little busy
right now.

09:21.066 --> 09:22.491
There's no one even here.

09:22.509 --> 09:25.327
Just give me a minute.
I promise you'll like it.

09:25.345 --> 09:26.629
Look.

09:26.663 --> 09:30.473
So I showed you the map
already, but there's more,

09:30.474 --> 09:31.934
a lot more.

09:31.969 --> 09:34.544
My father had tons
of these diaries.

09:34.556 --> 09:36.773
He filled one
up every month.

09:38.308 --> 09:40.276
Wow.

09:40.809 --> 09:44.995
So much history.
You've found my weak spot.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.457
They get somewhat more
cryptic as it goes on.

09:47.458 --> 09:49.118
He started losing
it towards the end.

09:49.152 --> 09:51.186
That's the one he was keeping
right before he died.

09:51.204 --> 09:53.539
Check out the
last few pages.

09:57.357 --> 09:59.328
"A parching imbued"?

10:00.697 --> 10:02.055
What does that mean?

10:02.367 --> 10:05.844
I think it's a code. I feel like
it's connected to Asgard somehow,

10:05.845 --> 10:09.722
but I need your help
to figure it out, Ingrid.

10:10.313 --> 10:13.059
Let's make history.
We can do this together.

10:13.717 --> 10:15.399
Why me?

10:16.263 --> 10:18.597
Because you're a witch.

10:28.635 --> 10:30.236
I'm not a witch.

10:30.237 --> 10:33.970
I saw you at the charity event right here.
That guy started getting rough with you.

10:33.971 --> 10:36.763
You said some words in Latin.
His fingers just broke.

10:36.764 --> 10:40.033
That is your evidence?
You have a very vivid imagination.

10:40.529 --> 10:42.618
If I'm wrong, then why
are you running away?

10:42.619 --> 10:44.169
I have work to do!

10:59.752 --> 11:01.614
Hey. Come here.

11:01.648 --> 11:03.002
Oh!

11:04.151 --> 11:06.502
Okay, check this out.

11:06.537 --> 11:08.588
Right here.

11:08.901 --> 11:11.736
This is where we start
our new life tomorrow.

11:11.886 --> 11:15.033
It just feels so surreal
that it's actually happening.

11:15.034 --> 11:18.700
Does feel like forever ago
when I asked you to marry me.

11:18.734 --> 11:21.069
Can I make a confession?

11:21.074 --> 11:23.567
I never wanted to get married.

11:23.715 --> 11:25.135
What?

11:25.170 --> 11:28.722
I just always thought
marriage was too... conventional

11:28.757 --> 11:30.808
and boring and normal.

11:30.842 --> 11:32.959
The end of any adventure
in life.

11:33.079 --> 11:36.954
- Should I be getting worried?
- (laughs) Until I met you.

11:37.227 --> 11:41.769
And I realized that marriage is more
than a picket fence and a minivan.

11:41.803 --> 11:45.272
It's about sharing your life
with someone you love.

11:46.757 --> 11:50.703
You know, as someone
who's been all over the world,

11:50.704 --> 11:53.497
I... I can honestly say,

11:53.531 --> 11:55.783
this, this right here...

11:55.817 --> 11:58.985
this is the adventure
I'm most looking forward to.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.238
Me, too.

12:15.437 --> 12:18.425
WENDY: Well, well, well,
if it isn't Victor.

12:18.619 --> 12:21.587
- Wendy...?
- In the flesh.

12:21.971 --> 12:23.858
Wow. I haven't
seen you in...

12:23.859 --> 12:26.067
A long time.
Let's not put a number on it.

12:26.068 --> 12:27.685
So what are you
doing here, Wendy?

12:27.805 --> 12:29.806
I thought all the Beauchamps
officially hated me.

12:29.807 --> 12:32.659
We do officially hate you,
but we also need your help.

12:32.660 --> 12:34.888
Well, Freya needs your help. You do
remember who Freya is, right?

12:34.889 --> 12:37.897
- Wait. Does Joanna know you're here?
- We discussed it.

12:37.932 --> 12:41.138
- So, what's the problem?
- Freya's lost her powers.

12:41.139 --> 12:43.803
Well, to be more precise,
somebody's taken them,

12:43.804 --> 12:46.643
and we've tried everything we
can think of except one thing.

12:46.644 --> 12:49.639
- No. No. No. Absolutely not.
- Let me finish.

12:49.640 --> 12:53.378
Look, I haven't practiced medicine or
done that kind of thing in a long time.

12:53.748 --> 12:57.068
I'm a professor now.
I'm more into history, academics.

12:57.069 --> 13:00.038
But I'm sure you can remember
how to do it.

13:00.072 --> 13:02.190
(scoffs)

13:03.092 --> 13:05.038
You do know what
you're asking, right?

13:05.039 --> 13:07.078
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't important.

13:07.079 --> 13:10.481
Plus, there is way more to the story.
Just give me five minutes.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.518
(sighs)

13:39.945 --> 13:41.865

I really don't think

it's dangerous?

15:00.030 --> 15:02.314
It might be.
We don't know what it is.

15:02.315 --> 15:04.111
Dash and I have been
investigating, but...

15:04.112 --> 15:06.671
Actually, it's a poison,

15:06.690 --> 15:10.382
and it's seeping through
the wall from another world.

15:10.383 --> 15:13.012
That's certainly a theory. Um...

Haven't you always wondered
what he was like?

27:45.999 --> 27:47.549
Sure.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.551
A long time ago.

27:49.585 --> 27:52.721
I used to fantasize about
coming home from school one day,

27:52.755 --> 27:55.089
and he would be sitting
on the front porch

27:55.090 --> 27:57.559
with books and
presents and toys,

27:57.560 --> 28:01.186
and... he would hug me and
we would eat ice cream together

28:01.187 --> 28:02.855
and stay up late
watching movies.

28:02.856 --> 28:06.739
But then I outgrew all of that.
All of it.

28:06.853 --> 28:10.939
He didn't want to know us, Freya.
I don't want to know him.

28:12.391 --> 28:15.060
Well, I'd like to get
to know him.

28:16.746 --> 28:19.581
Okay. Well,
that's-that's your decision.

28:21.271 --> 28:24.810
- Okay, let's not talk about this.
- Yeah. Good reveal.

28:24.811 --> 28:29.086
- Tell me about what happened with Mike.
- No, it's not... it's not that important.

28:29.087 --> 28:33.178
MAN: Hey, Freya, between you going on
your honeymoon and Killand taking off,

28:33.212 --> 28:34.872
I'm gonna need
some help around here.

28:34.873 --> 28:37.049
- So if you know anybody...
- Wait, I'm sorry...

28:37.050 --> 28:38.818
What do you mean,
Killian's taking off?

28:38.819 --> 28:40.255
- He didn't tell you?
- No.

28:40.256 --> 28:42.887
Killian's leaving tomorrow.
Sailing to Costa Rica.

28:43.056 --> 28:46.291
So... I hope you'll be back soon.

28:48.358 --> 28:49.904
Hey.

28:50.350 --> 28:54.320
Maybe it's for the best. I mean,
you and Dash, you get a clean start.

28:55.355 --> 28:57.556
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:59.076 --> 29:01.794
We have a rehearsal
dinner to get to.

29:01.829 --> 29:03.269
(sighs):
Okay.

29:09.035 --> 29:10.703
♪ (crickets chirping)

29:13.390 --> 29:15.007
(laughs):
Thank you.

29:15.041 --> 29:16.976
Drink up.

29:17.010 --> 29:18.978
Oh. Oh, thank you.

29:19.012 --> 29:21.013
Here you go, guys.

29:22.382 --> 29:23.850
Great.

29:26.219 --> 29:28.668
Something's beginning
to form on the canvas.

29:28.669 --> 29:31.524
Oh. I can't quite make it out yet,
but it looks like it's coming soon.

29:31.558 --> 29:33.922
- Are we all ready here?
- Yep. Everyone has a glass.

29:34.860 --> 29:37.932
All right, now that everybody's got
champagne, let's have a toast.

29:37.933 --> 29:41.269
- PENELOPE: Oh, of course. I'd love to.
- Why am I not surprised?

29:41.287 --> 29:43.238
Oh, relax... it's just a few words.

29:44.803 --> 29:46.220
(sighs): Ah...

29:46.575 --> 29:48.330
Well...

29:48.577 --> 29:52.630
It's taken a series of fortunate
events to bring us all here today.

29:52.665 --> 29:57.785
When I first discovered East End and
Fair Haven, I knew this was the place

29:57.820 --> 30:00.454
that I'd always
been searching for.

30:01.369 --> 30:06.656
And then when Dash met Freya, I thought,
"Could I really be so lucky?"

30:06.657 --> 30:09.341
Because I knew I wasn't
just getting Freya,

30:09.575 --> 30:12.459
I was getting
<i>all</i> the Beauchamps.

30:12.460 --> 30:13.842
What a gift.

30:13.843 --> 30:15.979
So raise a glass...

30:16.697 --> 30:20.784
To a wedding no one
will ever forget.

30:22.953 --> 30:24.973
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

30:25.322 --> 30:27.791
Cheers.

30:29.601 --> 30:33.075
That's great. Yeah.
I'm just gonna refill them.

30:36.816 --> 30:41.003
JOANNA: Well, everybody
relax and enjoy yourselves.

30:41.208 --> 30:43.660
Dinner'll be ready soon.

Well?

30:56.092 --> 30:59.240
Well, saliva isn't as good

Okay.

31:30.771 --> 31:32.312
What are you doing here?

31:33.367 --> 31:35.318
I asked him to come back.

31:50.332 --> 31:51.950
What were you thinking, Freya?

31:51.951 --> 31:54.477
I was thinking I wanted
to spend time with my father.

31:54.650 --> 31:56.985
Victor, I think
you should leave.

31:57.036 --> 32:00.976
I just don't think that Freya's rehearsal
dinner is the right time to reconnect.

32:01.001 --> 32:03.590
Hello? Like you said,
it's my rehearsal dinner.

32:03.621 --> 32:05.382
If I want him to stay,
he can stay.

32:05.383 --> 32:09.409
In my defense, Joanna, I was brought
here today. I didn't just show up.

32:09.410 --> 32:11.529
But now that I'm here, I should
at least be able to speak to them.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.524
- They're my children, too.
- Not if they don't want to speak to you.

32:14.525 --> 32:17.766
- l, I would like to speak to him.
- Why?

32:17.767 --> 32:20.659
Where have you been?
And I don't just mean in this life.

32:20.660 --> 32:23.538
I've seen tons of pictures from
the past... you're not in any of them.

32:23.539 --> 32:25.699
- Ingrid, I can explain.
- I'm sorry.

32:25.700 --> 32:27.934
I don't want to hear
your explanations.

32:28.427 --> 32:31.885
Hey, guys. It's getting kind of weird back
there with just me and the Gardiners.

32:31.886 --> 32:33.716
Oh, hey. You're back.

32:34.298 --> 32:36.735
I have to get dinner
on the table.

32:51.059 --> 32:53.310
I know it wasn't your idea
to come here.

32:53.325 --> 32:55.960
I'm sorry for the way
Mom and Ingrid are being.

32:55.994 --> 32:57.962
(chuckles)
It's okay, Freya.

32:57.996 --> 32:59.681
They have their reasons.

32:59.715 --> 33:01.832
If I were them, I wouldn't
talk to me either.

33:01.850 --> 33:06.675
Hey. Can I... show you
something?

33:12.811 --> 33:16.259
I know I've been gone but I...
I do keep up.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.261
As best I can.

33:19.568 --> 33:22.203
I don't understand.

33:22.237 --> 33:24.038
You left us.

33:24.510 --> 33:28.012
Uh... but I didn't leave
because I didn't love you.

33:29.211 --> 33:31.656
JOANNA: Freya, sweetie, you're
missing your dinner.

33:31.657 --> 33:34.006
And I'd like to...
talk to your father alone.

33:40.756 --> 33:42.890
- Look, Joanna, I don't...
- No, just listen.

33:42.925 --> 33:46.728
Freya does not need to get close
to you only to be abandoned again.

33:46.762 --> 33:49.981
I did not abandon anyone.

33:50.015 --> 33:52.216
Is that what you told them?

33:52.234 --> 33:54.530
Well, what should
I have told them?

33:56.794 --> 34:00.640
- I can't do this now.
- Joanna...

34:04.530 --> 34:06.897
(crickets chirping)

34:10.569 --> 34:12.136
Babe.

34:12.755 --> 34:14.572
- Hey.
- You okay?

34:14.590 --> 34:17.574
Yeah. Sorry. It's just
a little overwhelming in there.

34:17.592 --> 34:19.427
I can imagine.

34:19.460 --> 34:21.929
I just needed to get outside.

34:21.964 --> 34:24.081
Why don't we go somewhere?

34:24.099 --> 34:27.802
- What do you mean?
- Come on. Let's go. Just... you and me.

34:28.730 --> 34:30.330
Let's start our
adventure together.

34:30.331 --> 34:32.831
(chuckles) Okay.

34:37.478 --> 34:39.897
(sniffles)

34:41.596 --> 34:44.952
- Is everything okay?
- No. Not really.

34:44.987 --> 34:46.621
Not at all.

34:46.655 --> 34:49.072
(clicks tongue, sighs)

34:49.107 --> 34:53.205
I know your dad
being here...

34:53.627 --> 34:56.931
I'm not in the mood
for this man's excuses.

34:57.774 --> 34:59.300
You know?

34:59.334 --> 35:01.469
He missed his chance.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.247
Wendy.

35:10.604 --> 35:12.764
Can I speak to Ingrid alone,
please?

35:17.065 --> 35:18.903
Ingrid...

35:18.937 --> 35:20.738
(sighs)

35:20.773 --> 35:24.492
Yeah. That one doesn't forgive so easy.
Take it from me.

35:25.729 --> 35:27.606
(sighs)

35:30.449 --> 35:32.817
I always feel better
when I'm by the ocean.

35:32.835 --> 35:36.454
It's so big. It makes
my problems feel small.

35:36.488 --> 35:38.456
Well, now
they're our problems.

35:38.490 --> 35:40.792
(chuckles)

35:40.826 --> 35:44.178
What if it's something
you can't fix?

35:44.213 --> 35:46.180
No such thing.

35:46.215 --> 35:48.466
- I'm a doctor.
- (chuckles) I'm serious.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.802
I mean, look at my parents.

35:50.836 --> 35:53.805
They loved each other.
I know they did.

35:53.839 --> 35:58.776
But... it's not always enough.
It can still fall apart.

35:58.811 --> 36:02.113
No matter how much you love
someone, they can still walk away.

36:02.147 --> 36:05.182
I won't walk away from you.
Ever.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.685
I bet my parents told each other
the same thing.

36:07.686 --> 36:11.323
Just because it didn't work for them
doesn't mean that it won't for us.

36:11.487 --> 36:16.794
It's... a choice you have to make,
that you're not going anywhere.

36:16.829 --> 36:20.464
Even when it gets hard.
Especially when it gets hard.

36:20.499 --> 36:23.384
I promise you I will make
that choice every day.

36:24.703 --> 36:27.639
It's you and me
against the world.

36:28.090 --> 36:29.807
Deal?

36:30.318 --> 36:31.893
Deal.

36:37.182 --> 36:40.217
(groans) We should probably
get you home soon.

36:40.235 --> 36:43.187
Yeah. Probably should.

36:50.612 --> 36:53.414
I got to say
I missed your-your parties.

36:53.448 --> 36:56.527
And your cooking.
And, uh...

36:56.745 --> 36:58.569
And you.

37:01.239 --> 37:03.591
Joanna, for what it's worth,

37:03.625 --> 37:06.427
you know, you've done a...

37:06.461 --> 37:08.596
Pretty great job on your own.

37:08.630 --> 37:10.443
With everything.

37:11.780 --> 37:15.193
I can't imagine how hard
it must've been on you.

37:15.721 --> 37:17.889
So thank you.

37:17.923 --> 37:21.058
Thank you for taking
such good care of our girls.

37:21.092 --> 37:24.929
You're welcome. Thank you
for saying that, Victor.

37:24.947 --> 37:28.933
You probably don't believe me,
but I-I still think about you.

37:28.951 --> 37:31.435
Every day.

37:31.869 --> 37:36.073
And yet you've always known where I am.
Where all of us are.

37:36.367 --> 37:41.245
You know I never stopped loving you.
That wasn't what drove us apart.

37:46.168 --> 37:49.470
I've tried for centuries
to forget you.

37:49.504 --> 37:51.622
It doesn't work.

37:54.238 --> 37:56.685
When I see you, I still...

37:58.925 --> 38:00.765
Victor...

38:11.476 --> 38:13.244
(crickets chirping)

38:14.043 --> 38:15.652
Ingrid.

38:18.367 --> 38:22.453
- Mike, how did you find me here?
- I'm an explorer, remember?

38:22.487 --> 38:24.505
I explored a phone book.

38:24.539 --> 38:28.175
You can't just show up at my house.
Why are you here?

38:28.210 --> 38:30.921
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

38:31.981 --> 38:36.267
I know where the door to Asgard is.
And I know how to get through.

38:36.301 --> 38:38.469
There's no way through.

38:38.503 --> 38:41.522
There was only one key,
and it was destroyed.

38:41.556 --> 38:45.309
The <i>serpens clavem?</i>
Yeah, I know some things, too, Ingrid.

38:45.681 --> 38:48.379
There's a second key. This is
what I've been trying to tell you.

38:48.413 --> 38:52.316
- Where is it?
- Not where. It's <i>who</i>.

38:53.106 --> 38:54.986
It's you, Ingrid.

38:55.516 --> 38:58.522
"A parching imbued"
is the other key.

38:58.540 --> 39:01.993
You're the other key.
And you're gonna help me open it.

39:12.004 --> 39:14.638
Is that
what I think it is?

39:15.232 --> 39:18.169
The only tunnels in this town are
the catacombs under Fair Haven.

39:18.170 --> 39:19.810
I don't know
what else it could be.

39:19.845 --> 39:22.234
Well, I thought it was supposed
to show us who the shifter is.

39:22.235 --> 39:23.885
It was.

39:25.567 --> 39:28.719
- I don't know what this means.
- Well, we need to figure it out.

39:28.737 --> 39:31.405
Freya's getting married
there tomorrow.

39:50.042 --> 39:53.051
I'm finally going
to kill her, Father.

39:54.898 --> 39:57.349
And then I'm coming home.

40:11.279 --> 40:13.280
(exhales)

40:31.633 --> 40:34.085
(knocking)

40:45.296 --> 40:47.648
What are you doing here?

40:47.682 --> 40:49.470
I couldn't leave
without saying good-bye.

40:49.471 --> 40:51.044
(sighs)

40:52.491 --> 40:54.326
I'm in love with you.

40:57.025 --> 40:59.108
- What?
- Come with me. We can leave tonight.

40:59.109 --> 41:02.525
- Wait. Y-You need to stop.
- We belong together. You know we do.

41:02.531 --> 41:05.983
This is crazy.
I am marrying Dash tomorrow.

41:06.001 --> 41:09.587
You can't marry Dash. You'll just
become another one of his possessions.

41:09.621 --> 41:13.090
- It wouldn't be like that with us.
- There is no "us," Killian.

41:13.125 --> 41:14.825
You dreamt about me
before you met me.

41:14.843 --> 41:16.093
I dreamt about you, too.

41:16.128 --> 41:19.532
I didn't even think you existed until
I met you at that engagement party.

41:19.533 --> 41:22.133
My whole life,
I thought I was running away

41:22.167 --> 41:24.435
from everyone,
everything.

41:24.970 --> 41:26.770
But now I know I was...

41:27.016 --> 41:29.017
Just running toward you.

41:31.309 --> 41:36.397
I love you. I loved you
even before I met you.

41:43.304 --> 41:45.922
You marry him,
it'll destroy you.
