<i>My dad was making a sandwich
in the kitchen.</i>

00:26.874 --> 00:29.444
<i>He toasted the bread
over the stovetop.</i>

00:30.746 --> 00:34.717
<i>Mustard, mayonnaise,
chicken, no lettuce.</i>

00:36.886 --> 00:39.452
<i>He closed the sandwich
and walked with it</i>

00:39.454 --> 00:42.923
<i>into the living room.</i>

00:42.925 --> 00:47.661
<i>He turned on the television
and watched standing up,</i>

00:47.663 --> 00:49.831
<i>eating his sandwich.</i>

00:51.633 --> 00:55.404
<i>He ate every bite
except the corner of one crust.</i>

00:56.806 --> 01:00.707
<i>He set it, almost gently,
down on the table</i>

01:00.709 --> 01:03.610
<i>in front of the TV.</i>

01:03.612 --> 01:05.811
<i>He dusted his hands,</i>

01:05.813 --> 01:08.682
<i>freeing himself from crumbs,</i>

01:08.684 --> 01:12.519
<i>and walked out the front door.</i>

01:12.521 --> 01:15.758
<i>That was the last time
I saw him.</i>

01:17.125 --> 01:20.159
<i>I was three.</i>

01:27.468 --> 01:31.673
<i>Toothbrush, phone, three books.</i>

01:35.277 --> 01:38.212
<i>Five pairs of underwear,
two pairs of shoes,</i>

01:38.214 --> 01:41.381
<i>one lipstick, one mascara.</i>

01:41.383 --> 01:44.551
<i>The only three photos
I have from my father.</i>

01:50.392 --> 01:56.798
<i>One sweater, one coat,
two bras, sunglasses, no hat.</i>

01:58.500 --> 02:02.334
<i>Wallet, sleeping pills.</i>

02:02.336 --> 02:05.070
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we've
now dimmed the cabin light.</i>

02:05.072 --> 02:06.906
<i>If you wish to read,
please use the light</i>

02:06.908 --> 02:09.542
<i>in the panel above you.
Thank you.</i>

02:11.246 --> 02:13.579
<i>Last known address,</i>

02:13.581 --> 02:17.117
<i>three pairs of socks,
one skirt.</i>

02:21.456 --> 02:25.894
<i>I've been waiting
to do this my whole life.</i>

07:08.477 --> 07:10.012
Mm.

07:21.457 --> 07:24.489
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Hi.</i>

07:24.491 --> 07:27.492
<i>It's Lexi.</i>

07:27.494 --> 07:29.494
<i>How you doing?</i>

07:29.496 --> 07:31.163
<i>I've come to America.</i>

07:31.165 --> 07:33.566
<i>You're in America?</i>

07:33.568 --> 07:36.369
<i>I'm in Los Angeles.</i>

07:36.371 --> 07:38.571
- <i>You're joking?</i>
- <i>No, I'm not.</i>

07:38.573 --> 07:40.172
<i>I'm here.</i>

07:40.174 --> 07:42.574
I fucked everything up.

07:42.576 --> 07:44.509
Everything's gone.

07:44.511 --> 07:47.280
I've moved out my house.

07:47.282 --> 07:50.850
<i>It's just so horrible
with David.</i>

07:50.852 --> 07:54.386
<i>It used to be really nice,</i>

07:54.388 --> 07:57.590
<i>and now it's just so horrible.</i>

07:57.592 --> 08:00.393
<i>It's completely over.</i>

08:00.395 --> 08:02.561
<i>I don't really have
enough money to be doing this,</i>

08:02.563 --> 08:04.696
<i>so I've basically
taken everything that I've got</i>

08:04.698 --> 08:07.033
<i>and I've come here.</i>

08:07.035 --> 08:09.035
<i>I don't know what I'm doing.</i>

08:09.037 --> 08:12.037
<i>I don't know what I'm chasing.</i>

08:12.039 --> 08:13.807
<i>I mean,
I've lived all of this time</i>

08:13.809 --> 08:16.376
<i>without talking to my dad.
I don't really know...</i>

08:16.378 --> 08:19.244
<i>One sec, Lexi.</i>

08:19.246 --> 08:22.114
<i>Off you go.</i>

08:22.116 --> 08:24.117
<i>Just go ask Daddy.
Go speak to Daddy.</i>

08:24.119 --> 08:26.119
<i>Close the door for me, baby.
Go on. Off you go.</i>

08:26.121 --> 08:28.121
<i>Give me a second.
Mommy's on the phone, okay?</i>

08:28.123 --> 08:31.124
<i>Just go ask Daddy.</i>

09:38.760 --> 09:40.995
I love the light.

09:43.297 --> 09:46.531
And the table.

09:46.533 --> 09:48.503
And the view.

09:50.638 --> 09:52.472
Yeah.

09:52.474 --> 09:54.674
You just don't get that
in London.

09:54.676 --> 09:56.541
I guess.

09:56.543 --> 09:58.044
No, they're...

09:59.681 --> 10:01.381
Open. They...

10:01.383 --> 10:03.016
It's so open.

10:03.018 --> 10:04.918
It's so...

10:04.920 --> 10:06.486
Yeah. It's lovely.

10:06.488 --> 10:08.487
When I lived
in Northern California,

10:08.489 --> 10:12.391
I thought L.A.
was the pits, you know?

10:12.393 --> 10:18.598
And then I moved down here,
and it was a revelation.

10:18.600 --> 10:23.602
Anything you want to do,

10:23.604 --> 10:26.705
you can do in L.A. somewhere.

10:26.707 --> 10:28.907
What do you think
I should do while I'm here?

10:28.909 --> 10:30.910
Go to the beach.

10:36.683 --> 10:39.118
<i>It was 20 years ago.</i>

10:39.120 --> 10:42.955
He and the family
had been here for dinner,

10:42.957 --> 10:46.959
and then the next thing we knew,
he was gone.

10:46.961 --> 10:49.762
He had just deserted them.

10:49.764 --> 10:53.632
We really didn't want
to stay in touch with John

10:53.634 --> 10:58.907
because we felt
he was not a very good man.

11:03.043 --> 11:06.247
I know that you don't know
where John is...

11:09.050 --> 11:11.883
But I've come here today
because I'm hoping

11:11.885 --> 11:14.620
that you'll be able
to give me Ethel's address

11:14.622 --> 11:17.790
so that I can
get in touch with her.

11:19.661 --> 11:22.661
Maybe she knows.

15:21.302 --> 15:23.504
You're gonna do laundry?

15:25.306 --> 15:29.809
Can you take out your earphones?

15:29.811 --> 15:31.343
What?

15:31.345 --> 15:33.145
You asked me
about doing laundry.

15:33.147 --> 15:35.048
I did do laundry.

15:35.050 --> 15:37.683
Yeah, but you just left it
in the basket without folding.

15:37.685 --> 15:39.852
- It's clean...
- Whatever, it's fine.

15:39.854 --> 15:41.386
- It's fine.
- I didn't finish.

15:41.388 --> 15:43.054
I'll do it.

15:43.056 --> 15:46.224
- I'll just have to do it myself.
- Jesus Christ.

15:46.226 --> 15:48.093
How's she doing?

15:48.095 --> 15:50.929
Do you have to complain
about everything that I do?

15:50.931 --> 15:52.530
Ethel's fine.

15:52.532 --> 15:54.067
She's fine, like she's
sleeping?

15:54.069 --> 15:55.166
She's fine, she's resting?

15:55.168 --> 15:56.901
She's watching TV? What?

15:56.903 --> 15:59.237
- What is she doing right now?
- She's sleeping.

15:59.239 --> 16:01.006
She's fine.

16:01.008 --> 16:02.742
She's alive.

16:02.744 --> 16:05.410
I talked to her.

16:05.412 --> 16:07.213
I've seen her all day.

16:07.215 --> 16:09.584
- What did you talk about?
- We talked about...

16:10.718 --> 16:14.786
Okay, I don't remember
if we actually talked that much.

16:14.788 --> 16:16.222
Whatever, I-I...

16:16.224 --> 16:17.790
My mom has
congestive heart failure.

16:17.792 --> 16:20.693
She's not just laying around
for the fun of it.

16:20.695 --> 16:23.128
I just need you
to fucking help me, Angie.

16:23.130 --> 16:24.597
Like, fucking chill out.

16:24.599 --> 16:26.799
I was chill
until I walked into the house

16:26.801 --> 16:28.534
- and I see shit everywhere...
- Yeah, well,

16:28.536 --> 16:29.868
I was fucking chill
before you walked

16:29.870 --> 16:31.636
into the house.
I was relaxing...

16:31.638 --> 16:33.738
Oh, I'm sure, because
you're high and you're drunk.

16:33.740 --> 16:35.741
I could get
somebody else to do it.

16:35.743 --> 16:37.642
Great. However much you're
gonna pay that other person,

16:37.644 --> 16:39.411
'cause nobody else is gonna take
slave wages the way I do.

16:39.413 --> 16:40.780
Well, why don't you get
a real fucking job

16:40.782 --> 16:42.113
rather than lying
on the couch...

16:42.115 --> 16:43.448
I have a real job.

16:43.450 --> 16:44.983
All day smoking pot
and getting drunk?

16:44.985 --> 16:47.620
- Go and get a fucking job!
- I have a job at night!

16:47.622 --> 16:50.790
If you got a real job, then
we could pool money together

16:50.792 --> 16:53.659
to hire somebody
who actually cleans up.

16:53.661 --> 16:56.898
You're mom is dying.
I can't save her life.

17:01.069 --> 17:03.538
That's really fucking nice.

17:08.742 --> 17:11.476
I can't...
I can't do it on my own,

17:11.478 --> 17:13.647
and I need your help.

17:15.082 --> 17:16.682
I'm sorry.

17:16.684 --> 17:18.916
I love you.

17:18.919 --> 17:20.921
I love you, too.

18:35.161 --> 18:36.428
Hey, it is her.
Hey.

18:36.430 --> 18:37.762
There she is.

18:37.764 --> 18:39.565
- There she is.
- Hey.

18:39.567 --> 18:41.066
- Wow.
- How's it going?

18:41.068 --> 18:42.568
- This is Matt.
- Yeah, how are you?

18:42.570 --> 18:44.069
- Hi, Matt.
- I brought...

18:44.071 --> 18:45.570
- I brought a friend.
- This is America.

18:45.572 --> 18:47.440
We do things big.

18:47.442 --> 18:49.107
- Everything's bigger.
- Yeah.

18:49.109 --> 18:50.909
Twice the size.

18:53.414 --> 18:55.347
You like beer?
We brought some beer.

18:55.349 --> 18:56.781
Yeah. Thanks.

18:56.783 --> 18:58.584
- What's your name again?
- Matt.

18:58.586 --> 19:01.587
Yeah. Yeah, we've known
each other a while.

19:01.589 --> 19:02.922
- Hope it was okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.290
Right.

19:04.292 --> 19:05.758
- Yeah, so...
- Yeah.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.425
- Whatever, man.
- I said it'd be okay.

19:10.063 --> 19:11.532
Yeah, right?

19:12.867 --> 19:14.267
It's okay if I'm here, right?

19:14.269 --> 19:15.901
Yeah, I'm just gonna hang out.

19:15.903 --> 19:17.603
If it wasn't okay,
I would've told you to leave.

19:17.605 --> 19:19.137
- Oh, you would?
- Yeah. She's straightforward.

19:19.139 --> 19:20.806
- Right? Yeah. That's why...
- She was.

19:20.808 --> 19:22.575
It's, like, yeah.

19:22.577 --> 19:24.143
- She's, like, no bullshit.
- Yeah.

19:24.145 --> 19:25.778
- She throws it back on you.
- Yeah, I like that.

19:25.780 --> 19:27.245
- Yeah.
- You like that?

19:27.247 --> 19:28.914
I do like that.

19:28.916 --> 19:30.482
'Cause girls over here,
sometimes you don't really know

19:30.484 --> 19:31.951
what they're thinking,
but with this one...

19:31.953 --> 19:33.953
- Yeah.
- She thinks it and she says it.

19:33.955 --> 19:36.489
- Sit down.
- Yeah. Yeah.

19:36.491 --> 19:38.824
- Yeah.
- Sit down, Matt.

19:38.826 --> 19:40.459
Do you pay by the week?

19:40.461 --> 19:43.628
You pay by the hour,
or you... by the day?

19:43.630 --> 19:45.598
What is it?

19:45.600 --> 19:47.933
- Yeah, I pay by the day.
- By the day?

19:47.935 --> 19:49.501
- Come here.
- Here?

19:49.503 --> 19:50.836
- Yeah, right here.
- Right there?

19:50.838 --> 19:52.637
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

19:52.639 --> 19:54.106
- Does it feel good?
- Yeah, it's all right.

19:54.108 --> 19:56.942
Yeah?
Is this what you had in mind?

19:56.944 --> 19:59.845
Yeah, I guess.

19:59.847 --> 20:03.281
Is that what you had in mind?

20:03.283 --> 20:04.983
Yeah. I was worried
when we knocked on the door.

20:04.985 --> 20:06.751
- What about you?
- Yeah, I didn't think

20:06.753 --> 20:08.620
she was gonna be here.
No, yeah, this is great.

20:08.622 --> 20:09.989
- This is great.
- You got too many...

20:09.991 --> 20:11.656
You got too much
clothes on, though.

20:11.658 --> 20:12.957
I don't know why
you're wearing these.

20:12.959 --> 20:14.326
- These are...
- What are those?

20:14.328 --> 20:15.828
Are those uncomfortable?

20:15.830 --> 20:17.328
- You want to take those off?
- No, love.

20:17.330 --> 20:18.830
- No? They feel good?
- There all right.

20:18.832 --> 20:20.098
- Yeah?
- They're all right.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.834
- Ah, her accent.
- I know, right?

20:21.836 --> 20:23.336
- Yeah.
- It's great.

20:23.338 --> 20:24.669
Right.

20:26.107 --> 20:27.540
Hello.

20:29.310 --> 20:32.113
Can I take this zipper down?

20:52.332 --> 20:55.166
Just slide that down.

20:55.168 --> 21:00.205
I think... I think maybe
we do this, right?

21:00.207 --> 21:02.040
Just take that off.

21:02.042 --> 21:05.213
Sit up.

21:10.650 --> 21:12.853
- No.
- Take it off?

21:15.689 --> 21:19.058
- What I'm interested in...
- Yeah?

21:19.060 --> 21:22.027
Yeah?

21:22.029 --> 21:25.897
Yeah?

21:25.899 --> 21:27.732
- Do you want to see it?
- Yeah.

21:27.734 --> 21:29.601
- Okay.
- Yeah?

21:29.603 --> 21:31.604
- Yeah.
- Right.

21:31.606 --> 21:33.405
- Go ahead.
- Okay. Right now?

21:33.407 --> 21:35.240
Yeah, yeah, right now.

21:35.242 --> 21:37.909
- Is that all right with you?
- Yeah, that's fine with me.

21:37.911 --> 21:39.845
- You ready for this?
- I don't know.

21:39.847 --> 21:42.047
- How can I possibly know that.
- All right, here we go.

21:44.051 --> 21:46.385
That's...

21:46.387 --> 21:48.556
that's the equipment.

21:53.894 --> 21:55.927
- Lie down.
- All right.

21:55.929 --> 21:58.062
- Lie down.
- Okay.

21:59.734 --> 22:01.099
You know what?

22:01.101 --> 22:02.768
- I think I need a drink.
- Yeah.

22:02.770 --> 22:04.269
We have plenty.

22:09.376 --> 22:11.346
- Open it.
- Yeah.

22:23.791 --> 22:25.624
You look really fine.

22:55.156 --> 22:57.325
You have no idea what's coming.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.931
- What...
- She can't hear us right now.

23:05.933 --> 23:08.267
- The fuck is going on?
- I don't know.

23:08.269 --> 23:11.970
Every time I touch her,
she pushes me away.

23:14.175 --> 23:15.507
Now what?

23:17.844 --> 23:19.677
- Now what?
- What do you want to do?

23:21.215 --> 23:22.882
What do you think
I want to do?

25:11.359 --> 25:15.763
<i>David would pick the pub
and text me the address.</i>

25:19.367 --> 25:23.402
<i>I loved the moment when
he saw me come in the door.</i>

25:23.404 --> 25:26.405
<i>I wasn't me.
I was a prostitute.</i>

25:26.407 --> 25:30.578
<i>And he was
some lonely drunk guy.</i>

25:31.712 --> 25:34.646
<i>I'd had a few
shitty tricks that day</i>

25:34.648 --> 25:36.315
<i>and was looking for someone</i>

25:36.317 --> 25:39.318
<i>who wouldn't
just come on my face.</i>

25:39.320 --> 25:42.855
<i>He'd seem nice, but also like
he could shove his fingers</i>

25:42.857 --> 25:45.190
<i>up my ass
when he fucked me,</i>

25:45.192 --> 25:48.527
<i>maybe pull my hair
just a bit too hard.</i>

25:48.529 --> 25:51.296
<i>I'd walk straight up
to him at the bar</i>

25:51.298 --> 25:54.098
<i>and slide my leg over his</i>

25:54.100 --> 25:57.636
<i>so my cunt was pushing
into his thigh</i>

25:57.638 --> 26:00.539
<i>and tell him if he made me come,</i>

26:00.541 --> 26:02.974
<i>I wouldn't charge him.</i>

26:02.976 --> 26:05.677
<i>That was
our favorite role-play...</i>

26:05.679 --> 26:08.681
<i>100% success rate.</i>

26:08.683 --> 26:10.919
<i>But I always thought...</i>

26:12.186 --> 26:14.453
<i>What if I really did that?</i>

26:14.455 --> 26:16.655
<i>Could I do that?</i>

26:16.657 --> 26:21.859
<i>Would I still be me
if I did that?</i>

26:21.861 --> 26:23.662
<i>But as it turns out,</i>

26:23.664 --> 26:27.502
<i>the strangeness
is not what made it hot.</i>

26:30.169 --> 26:34.039
<i>It was the familiarity.</i>

26:34.041 --> 26:37.278
<i>I always learn
these lessons too late.</i>

28:58.484 --> 29:00.021
Hello?

29:01.121 --> 29:02.721
Hey. Hi.

29:02.723 --> 29:04.857
I'm sorry, I just wanted
to bring in these

29:04.859 --> 29:06.691
for Tanya's mum, for Ethel.

29:06.693 --> 29:10.061
I've just brought...
brought her some groceries.

29:10.063 --> 29:12.166
Okay. Come on back.

29:15.301 --> 29:17.038
Set them right here.

29:21.140 --> 29:22.776
Sure.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.513
Who are you?

29:29.515 --> 29:31.686
I'm just a friend
of Tanya's.

29:33.820 --> 29:36.456
Tanya ordered these from you?

29:47.868 --> 29:49.704
Friend of Tanya's?

29:55.876 --> 29:58.742
I knew it.

29:58.744 --> 30:00.580
You're fucking Tanya.

30:02.182 --> 30:03.781
You are. You're fucking Tanya.

30:03.783 --> 30:05.117
You're fucking...

30:05.119 --> 30:06.684
Fucking bitch.

30:06.686 --> 30:08.222
No.

30:09.189 --> 30:10.254
- No.
- No?

30:10.256 --> 30:12.022
No, you're not fucking...

30:12.024 --> 30:13.258
- you're not fucking Tanya?
- No.

30:13.260 --> 30:14.425
Don't fucking lie to me.

30:14.427 --> 30:15.760
What you want me to say?

30:15.762 --> 30:17.695
I just want you
to say the truth.

30:17.697 --> 30:20.400
I just want you to say the truth
in your little British accent.

30:26.039 --> 30:28.242
I'm her sister.

30:34.214 --> 30:36.417
Fuck.

30:54.900 --> 30:56.436
You want?

30:58.238 --> 30:59.773
Thanks.

31:08.248 --> 31:09.783
Can I see Ethel?

31:11.618 --> 31:12.783
Yeah.

31:12.785 --> 31:15.388
She's just, uh,
right through here.

31:19.792 --> 31:21.795
Go on in.

33:56.416 --> 33:58.116
Close the curtains.

33:58.118 --> 33:59.285
Yeah.

34:09.964 --> 34:11.663
They closed?

34:11.665 --> 34:15.166
Yeah, but
I-I couldn't find...

34:15.168 --> 34:16.333
so...

34:16.335 --> 34:18.335
You gonna sit down?

34:18.337 --> 34:20.337
Yeah.

34:20.339 --> 34:22.340
Don't sit there.

34:22.342 --> 34:23.911
Sit there.

34:25.311 --> 34:27.580
Oh. Okay.

34:37.357 --> 34:39.357
- Okay?
- Yeah.

34:39.359 --> 34:41.429
Yeah, it's good.

34:44.331 --> 34:46.063
You remember Danny?

34:46.065 --> 34:49.032
We were, uh...
we're in the field today,

34:49.034 --> 34:50.534
and...

34:50.536 --> 34:52.036
That son of a bitch...

34:52.038 --> 34:53.704
he gets out of the truck,

34:53.706 --> 34:56.041
and comes over,
and he's, like, "Hey!"

34:56.043 --> 34:58.576
I don't want
to hear about this.

34:58.578 --> 35:01.114
- What's that?
- I'm not interested.

35:05.152 --> 35:06.717
Yeah. Okay.

35:06.719 --> 35:08.688
Take off your jacket.

35:17.163 --> 35:20.197
Thank you.

35:31.844 --> 35:34.411
So what are you doing here?

35:34.413 --> 35:38.819
I, uh, just wanted
to see you again.

35:39.886 --> 35:42.786
- Yeah? You like me?
- Yeah. Uh, yeah.

35:42.788 --> 35:44.355
Yeah.

35:44.357 --> 35:47.891
I had a good time.
Uh...

35:47.893 --> 35:50.997
- Yeah, it was all right.
- Yeah, it was.

36:17.056 --> 36:19.092
Just tell me what to do.

36:23.563 --> 36:25.766
- Unbutton your fly.
- Yeah.

36:33.906 --> 36:36.109
- Take off your shirt.
- Yeah.

36:45.384 --> 36:49.487
Are you gonna
do it and make a surprise?

36:49.489 --> 36:51.188
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

36:51.190 --> 36:52.357
Yeah.

37:38.337 --> 37:40.607
Tell me what you like.

37:47.313 --> 37:49.346
Is this what you like?

37:49.348 --> 37:50.681
Yeah.

37:50.683 --> 37:52.550
- That?
- Yeah.

37:52.552 --> 37:54.722
Just like that?

37:55.855 --> 37:58.024
Tell me something I don't know.

38:00.293 --> 38:01.659
You have a wife?

38:01.661 --> 38:03.994
Uh, no. I don't have one.

38:03.996 --> 38:06.063
You got a girlfriend?

38:06.065 --> 38:07.599
No.

38:07.601 --> 38:09.266
No. Don't have one.

38:09.268 --> 38:11.369
You don't really...
you can't have sex.

38:11.371 --> 38:12.704
I fuck a lot.

38:12.706 --> 38:13.938
I've got fucked
by girls like you.

38:13.940 --> 38:15.607
No, you don't.

38:15.609 --> 38:17.275
- Yeah, I do.
- No, you really don't.

38:17.277 --> 38:19.177
- I fuck girls just like you.
- Oh, just like me?

38:19.179 --> 38:21.244
- Yeah.
- Yeah. And what...

38:21.246 --> 38:22.614
what are they like?

38:22.616 --> 38:23.880
They got cute hair
just like you.

38:23.882 --> 38:25.116
They've got cute what?

38:25.118 --> 38:26.516
Yeah, cute hair
just like you.

38:26.518 --> 38:27.719
- Cute hair?
- Yeah.

38:27.721 --> 38:29.052
- Just like me?
- Uh-huh.

38:29.054 --> 38:30.621
You fuck girls
with hair like me?

38:30.623 --> 38:32.389
- Yeah.
- That's what you like.

38:32.391 --> 38:34.092
You know, I went to Cambridge.
Do you know that? Yeah?

38:34.094 --> 38:36.059
No, I didn't
fucking know that.

38:36.061 --> 38:37.929
Well, I went to Cambridge,
and I read English literature,

38:37.931 --> 38:40.398
and I fucking don't go
all over the fucking world,

38:40.400 --> 38:41.766
and now I'm here...

38:41.768 --> 38:44.003
with you.

38:46.371 --> 38:48.405
Do you...

38:48.407 --> 38:51.275
do you like me at all?

38:51.277 --> 38:53.277
No.

38:53.279 --> 38:54.277
Yeah, you do.

38:54.279 --> 38:55.612
No, I don't.

39:08.462 --> 39:10.494
Go away now.

39:10.496 --> 39:11.996
What?

39:11.998 --> 39:13.665
I want you to leave.

39:20.674 --> 39:23.474
<i>"Then after an interminable time</i>

39:23.476 --> 39:25.275
<i>"as it seemed to us,</i>

39:25.277 --> 39:28.079
<i>"crouching and appearing
through the hedge,</i>

39:28.081 --> 39:32.083
<i>"came a sound like
the distant concussion of a gun.</i>

39:32.085 --> 39:34.121
<i>"Concussion of a gun.</i>

39:35.288 --> 39:36.820
"Another nearer,

39:36.822 --> 39:38.489
"and then another,

39:38.491 --> 39:41.458
"and then the Martian beside us
raised his tube on high

39:41.460 --> 39:45.663
"and discharged it gun-wise
with a heavy report

39:45.665 --> 39:47.331
"that made the ground heave.

39:47.333 --> 39:50.835
The one towards Dais..."

39:50.837 --> 39:53.137
Tanya doesn't have
John's number,

39:53.139 --> 39:56.139
but I know he worked
for this company a while back.

39:56.141 --> 39:58.809
I don't know any more than that,
and just so you know,

39:58.811 --> 40:01.982
I was not involved in this.

40:08.154 --> 40:10.855
<i>I'm not really sure
where he is.</i>

40:10.857 --> 40:12.857
<i>He changed
his phone number a lot.</i>

40:14.627 --> 40:17.328
<i>I'm not sure
if I can help you out at all.</i>

40:17.330 --> 40:19.197
<i>You know what?
I did work with him</i>

40:19.199 --> 40:23.000
<i>at these old people's house
a few weeks ago.</i>

40:23.002 --> 40:24.701
<i>I think I have the address
if you want it.</i>

40:24.703 --> 40:27.038
<i>You could ask them.</i>

40:27.040 --> 40:28.907
<i>Yeah, I know he went back...</i>

40:51.864 --> 40:54.801
Hold on just a minute.

41:03.176 --> 41:05.576
- Hello.
- Can I help you?

41:05.578 --> 41:07.579
Yes, I'm so sorry
to bother you.

41:07.581 --> 41:09.413
I'm looking
for a man called John

41:09.415 --> 41:13.116
who I think did some work
at your house the other day,

41:13.118 --> 41:17.355
and I was just wondering whether
I might be able to find a way

41:17.357 --> 41:19.690
to get in touch with him?

41:19.692 --> 41:22.125
- I know it sounds strange.
- It does. Yes.

41:22.127 --> 41:25.362
Um, I haven't been able
to get in touch with him

41:25.364 --> 41:27.764
through his family,

41:27.766 --> 41:30.101
'cause nobody really knows
where he is.

41:30.103 --> 41:34.105
There was a man
through the handiwork agency...

41:34.107 --> 41:36.474
- Yeah?
- That did do some work for me

41:36.476 --> 41:38.108
several days ago.

41:38.110 --> 41:39.944
Why don't you come in
and I'll look for the...

41:39.946 --> 41:42.279
I think I have the card
in the other room.

41:42.281 --> 41:45.616
And then he went upstairs and
put them in all the bedrooms.

41:45.618 --> 41:50.454
And I believe he put a new one
in that hallway up there.

41:50.456 --> 41:54.157
- That's good.
- And for safety reasons, I...

41:54.159 --> 41:56.494
because I get
a little bit dizzy now

41:56.496 --> 41:59.063
every once in a while
from my allergies,

41:59.065 --> 42:04.936
a separate banister
on this side of the stairway

42:04.938 --> 42:07.938
and then this side.

42:14.614 --> 42:16.146
Is it out?
Let it out slow.

42:16.148 --> 42:18.148
Let me see...
let me see how high you can...

42:20.752 --> 42:22.085
What are you doing?

42:22.087 --> 42:23.654
You have to breathe...

42:23.656 --> 42:25.657
Let it out slowly.

42:25.659 --> 42:27.090
Okay, one more time.

42:27.092 --> 42:29.826
No, can you...
deep... deep breath.

42:29.828 --> 42:32.663
That's not very good.

42:32.665 --> 42:35.333
Here's that number.

42:35.335 --> 42:37.835
Do you have something
to write this down?

42:37.837 --> 42:39.170
I have my phone.
I'm all ready.

42:39.172 --> 42:41.471
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

43:01.194 --> 43:03.293
<i>Hi, this is John.</i>

43:03.295 --> 43:05.329
<i>Please leave me a message,
and I'll get back to you.</i>

43:05.331 --> 43:06.333
<i>Bye.</i>

43:08.100 --> 43:10.034
<i>Hello, this is Lexi.</i>

43:10.036 --> 43:13.503
<i>If I have the right number,
that means I'm your daughter.</i>

43:13.505 --> 43:16.507
<i>I'm calling
because I'm in Los Angeles,</i>

43:16.509 --> 43:19.210
<i>and I'd like to see you...
to meet you,</i>

43:19.212 --> 43:22.746
<i>so please call me back.</i>

43:22.748 --> 43:24.748
<i>Okay.</i>

43:24.750 --> 43:26.986
<i>That's all. Bye.</i>

43:40.667 --> 43:42.699
All right, buddy.

43:42.701 --> 43:44.701
I'm gonna set you down.

43:46.038 --> 43:48.038
Your ball. Get your ball.

43:49.743 --> 43:50.942
- All right.
- Go!

43:50.944 --> 43:52.509
Now I'm gonna get you out.

43:52.511 --> 43:54.612
Come here.

43:54.614 --> 43:56.514
Okay.

43:58.851 --> 44:00.717
Oh, what do you got there?

44:00.719 --> 44:02.719
Can I see it?

47:12.244 --> 47:14.447
That's me.

47:17.250 --> 47:19.282
That's my mum.

47:19.284 --> 47:22.688
You can't see her much there.

47:24.223 --> 47:26.426
This is right before he left.

47:28.393 --> 47:32.762
My mum sort of fell apart
after that.

47:32.764 --> 47:36.703
I don't think she ever really
took to motherhood.

47:40.906 --> 47:43.809
And there he is.

48:13.806 --> 48:15.342
Hi.

48:17.944 --> 48:19.876
Are you Lexi?

48:19.878 --> 48:21.447
Yeah.

48:22.815 --> 48:24.818
- Tanya?
- Yeah.

48:32.759 --> 48:36.793
You've been spending
a lot of time at my house.

48:36.795 --> 48:40.998
It's a little weird to come home
to somebody in my kitchen.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.670
Yeah, I can see that.

48:45.103 --> 48:47.337
It would have been nice
if you had introduced yourself

48:47.339 --> 48:48.674
to me.

48:50.308 --> 48:52.009
- Of course.
- Asked permission

48:52.011 --> 48:53.811
if you could be spending
every day in my house

48:53.813 --> 48:55.545
- while I'm at work.
- Yeah, I-I...

48:55.547 --> 48:58.984
Rather than sneaking
behind my back.

49:00.853 --> 49:03.554
Yeah.

49:03.556 --> 49:05.221
Sorry.

49:05.223 --> 49:07.393
Did you get what you came for?

49:10.330 --> 49:11.895
Well, I assume
you came for something,

49:11.897 --> 49:13.866
so what do you want?

49:15.868 --> 49:17.500
You know what I want.

49:17.502 --> 49:18.902
You said you wanted
to meet me. Here I am.

49:18.904 --> 49:20.704
I mean,
you got what you came for.

49:20.706 --> 49:23.410
I don't... I don't know
what you want from me.

49:26.344 --> 49:28.279
I don't even think
that you should be here.

49:28.281 --> 49:30.246
I think you should
get your stuff,

49:30.248 --> 49:32.418
and then you can be on your way.

49:34.886 --> 49:37.253
Really?

49:37.255 --> 49:41.226
I can be on my way?

49:43.862 --> 49:47.398
I can be on my way?

49:47.400 --> 49:51.067
I'm your sister.

49:51.069 --> 49:54.737
Did you know I existed?

49:54.739 --> 49:56.909
Did you know you had a sister?

50:06.384 --> 50:09.119
You knew that I existed.

50:09.121 --> 50:11.424
You knew that I was over there.

50:12.859 --> 50:15.291
You knew
that I was there with my mum

50:15.293 --> 50:16.793
looking after me
without my dad.

50:16.795 --> 50:19.130
You knew that, and
you didn't get in touch with me.

50:19.132 --> 50:20.563
You didn't write me a letter.

50:20.565 --> 50:22.299
You left me
to come over here to find you.

50:22.301 --> 50:23.666
I was a fucking kid.

50:23.668 --> 50:25.302
You were not
a part of my childhood.

50:25.304 --> 50:26.804
You were a part
of my existence.

50:26.806 --> 50:29.876
And I clearly have
my fucking hands full!

50:33.878 --> 50:37.648
Is that really all
you've got to say to me?

50:37.650 --> 50:39.416
I mean, what...
how difficult can it be?

50:39.418 --> 50:40.817
He said that he had
no contact with you.

50:40.819 --> 50:42.453
That your mom just
took you and left

50:42.455 --> 50:44.020
and that we didn't
have any idea...

50:44.022 --> 50:45.688
I didn't know anything
about you or where you were.

50:45.690 --> 50:47.525
Oh, come on.
All I want to do

50:47.527 --> 50:49.992
is fucking meet you
and talk to you.

50:49.994 --> 50:53.764
All I want to do
is try to speak to you.

50:53.766 --> 50:56.433
All I've been trying to do
for the last fucking month

50:56.435 --> 50:58.634
pretty much
is look for you

50:58.636 --> 51:01.637
and look for my father
and look for my fucking family.

51:01.639 --> 51:03.373
No, let's just brush her
under the fucking carpet

51:03.375 --> 51:07.844
like the same thing that's been
happening for the last 40 years.

51:07.846 --> 51:09.980
I'm the one
who's traveled here.

51:09.982 --> 51:11.514
I'm the one
who's come all this way.

51:11.516 --> 51:13.183
I'm the one
that was over there

51:13.185 --> 51:15.853
while your dad was just having
fun over here with your mum

51:15.855 --> 51:17.487
and taking you all out
to the fucking shops.

51:17.489 --> 51:18.621
Oh, yeah, we had
so much fucking fun.

51:18.623 --> 51:20.023
Or whatever you were doing.

51:20.025 --> 51:21.558
You're being subversive
and sneaking

51:21.560 --> 51:23.125
into my house
when I'm not here,

51:23.127 --> 51:24.661
and then you come
to tell me that my life

51:24.663 --> 51:26.163
was so much better
than yours,

51:26.165 --> 51:27.565
and you just want
to cry in front of me?

51:27.567 --> 51:29.032
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

51:29.034 --> 51:30.833
And tell me that you
had a shit life

51:30.835 --> 51:32.369
and I had a good life?
That's not how it was.

51:32.371 --> 51:33.871
That's not how
it worked out.

51:33.873 --> 51:36.306
And that's a really
fucked-up thing to do.

51:36.308 --> 51:37.708
And I think
you should leave.

51:37.710 --> 51:39.041
I don't think
that you should be here.

51:39.043 --> 51:40.578
- Really? Is that it?
- Yeah.

51:40.580 --> 51:42.012
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's it.

51:42.014 --> 51:44.882
I don't think
that you should be here.

51:44.884 --> 51:49.688
I'm not exactly
proud of myself.

51:54.293 --> 51:56.360
But I did try.

51:56.362 --> 52:01.030
You can say that for me.

52:01.032 --> 52:03.266
I know I fucked it up.

52:06.772 --> 52:11.074
'Cause you just want
to fucking get rid of me.

52:11.076 --> 52:13.777
Let's be honest.

52:13.779 --> 52:16.614
Yeah.

52:19.418 --> 52:21.654
Oh, God.

52:42.674 --> 52:46.012
That went well.

52:55.253 --> 52:57.190
Yeah.

53:03.895 --> 53:06.865
That's why
I don't open my mouth.

53:08.900 --> 53:12.437
Oh, God.

53:17.777 --> 53:21.011
Will you say good-bye
to Ethel for me?

53:21.013 --> 53:23.145
Because...

53:23.147 --> 53:26.885
I don't want that
to be the last thing she hears.

54:00.485 --> 54:02.922
Ah, shit.

54:19.471 --> 54:24.206
<i>This is John.
Um...</i>

54:24.208 --> 54:26.043
<i>Yes, we can meet.
Certainly.</i>

54:26.045 --> 54:29.012
<i>That would be great.
I'm working in L.A.</i>

54:29.014 --> 54:33.250
<i>I can text you
the address if you like,</i>

54:33.252 --> 54:36.652
<i>and, um, yeah,
let's get together.</i>

54:36.654 --> 54:40.223
<i>Okay.
Look forward to it.</i>

54:40.225 --> 54:42.194
<i>Cheers.</i>

54:44.864 --> 54:47.699
<i>I see him
before he sees me.</i>

54:50.402 --> 54:52.668
<i>I panic a bit
because he's smaller</i>

54:52.670 --> 54:56.172
<i>than I thought he'd be.</i>

54:56.174 --> 54:59.442
<i>I'm about to run
when he lifts his head</i>

54:59.444 --> 55:01.411
<i>and sees me.</i>

55:01.413 --> 55:03.547
<i>And he can't stop
the huge smile</i>

55:03.549 --> 55:06.784
<i>that comes to his face.</i>

55:06.786 --> 55:10.119
<i>Same with the tears
that fill his eyes.</i>

55:10.121 --> 55:14.291
<i>I walk slowly towards him,
and we're speechless.</i>

55:14.293 --> 55:16.759
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

55:16.761 --> 55:18.962
<i>He pulls me into a hug,
and I feel it.</i>

55:18.964 --> 55:20.963
<i>This is my father.
He loves me.</i>

55:20.965 --> 55:23.366
<i>It doesn't matter all the years
he didn't contact me.</i>

55:23.368 --> 55:25.101
<i>He's loved me all along.</i>

55:25.103 --> 55:29.605
<i>He says, "I want to take you
somewhere special."</i>

55:29.607 --> 55:34.445
<i>And we get in his car,
and I know that I'm safe.</i>

55:34.447 --> 55:36.279
<i>He'll take care of me.</i>

55:36.281 --> 55:38.148
<i>He talks about making up
for lost time...</i>

55:38.150 --> 55:40.250
<i>all the things he wished
he had seen me do.</i>

55:40.252 --> 55:43.487
<i>I watch him closely.
I see his face in mine.</i>

55:43.489 --> 55:48.458
<i>Everything bad
just floats out the window.</i>

55:48.460 --> 55:51.561
<i>He's driving me home.</i>

57:59.924 --> 58:03.228
Hey.
How you doing?

58:11.369 --> 58:14.906
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

58:17.576 --> 58:20.242
Good to see you.
Thanks for coming.

58:20.244 --> 58:23.279
Um, that's all right.

58:23.281 --> 58:25.949
You all right?

58:25.951 --> 58:27.617
- I'm all right.
- You have a good trip?

58:27.619 --> 58:31.954
Um, it was
all right.

58:33.558 --> 58:35.291
You work here?
This is your place?

58:35.293 --> 58:37.126
Yeah, we're knocking
this place down.

58:37.128 --> 58:40.329
Just moving the steel.
Folks coming to get it in a bit.

58:49.808 --> 58:51.675
- So...
- Well, it was a surprise

58:51.677 --> 58:54.981
to hear your call,
that's for sure.

58:57.549 --> 59:01.150
Got anything you want
to say to me?

59:01.152 --> 59:02.853
Nice to see you.
You look like your mother.

59:02.855 --> 59:05.322
Nice to see you.

59:05.324 --> 59:07.690
Yeah, people say
that I look like my mother.

59:07.692 --> 59:09.960
- How is she?
- Um, she's dead.

59:09.962 --> 59:11.594
I'm sorry.

59:11.596 --> 59:13.462
These things happen.

59:13.464 --> 59:17.132
Yeah.

59:17.134 --> 59:18.668
Talk to me.
What's up?

59:18.670 --> 59:22.005
I don't know.
Um...

59:22.007 --> 59:23.340
How long
have you got?

59:23.342 --> 59:25.007
How long have I got
for what?

59:25.009 --> 59:26.442
To talk.

59:26.444 --> 59:28.011
Well, I got to get
this shit moved.

59:28.013 --> 59:29.212
I have a bloke coming
for this steel

59:29.214 --> 59:31.681
in about half
an hour, so...

59:31.683 --> 59:33.849
Half an hour?

59:33.851 --> 59:36.018
You know, I had
no idea you were coming.

59:36.020 --> 59:37.186
Well, you did.
I called you.

59:37.188 --> 59:39.355
Yeah, but I've
got to work.

59:39.357 --> 59:41.157
What do you want? Just tell me
what you want from me.

59:41.159 --> 59:42.625
I wanted to meet you.
I wanted to meet you.

59:42.627 --> 59:46.496
- Well, now you've met me.
- No, I haven't.

59:46.498 --> 59:48.331
I thought maybe
you might start something.

59:48.333 --> 59:49.666
All right, so what do you do
for a living?

59:49.668 --> 59:50.866
Let's start there.

59:50.868 --> 59:53.536
Um, I work in theatre.

59:53.538 --> 59:55.871
- Doing what?
- I work in theatre design.

59:55.873 --> 59:57.306
What do you do
for a living?

59:57.308 --> 59:59.076
- What does it look like?
- Yeah, right.

59:59.078 --> 01:00:00.643
I'm a brain surgeon.

01:00:00.645 --> 01:00:03.616
I'm doing a bit
of construction on the side.

01:00:06.351 --> 01:00:08.085
Well, I don't know,
do I?

01:00:08.087 --> 01:00:10.219
Well, it's pretty
apparent, I think.

01:00:10.221 --> 01:00:11.887
Well, it is now,
but I didn't know.

01:00:11.889 --> 01:00:14.257
Okay, okay.

01:00:14.259 --> 01:00:16.358
Just show up in my life, and
I'm, what, gonna drop it all?

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.862
I didn't just
show up in your life.

01:00:18.864 --> 01:00:20.730
- Yeah, you did.
- You had a child.

01:00:20.732 --> 01:00:22.398
That was
a long time ago.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:26.168
Look, I've come
a long way.

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:28.003
I wanted to see you.

01:00:28.005 --> 01:00:29.338
And I just thought
that maybe

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.409
you might be able
to explain to me

01:00:32.411 --> 01:00:34.945
why you haven't
been in touch

01:00:34.947 --> 01:00:37.079
throughout
my whole life.

01:00:37.081 --> 01:00:40.416
I left.
What can I tell you?

01:00:41.587 --> 01:00:43.286
You could have
asked about me.

01:00:43.288 --> 01:00:44.853
You could have left me
your phone number.

01:00:44.855 --> 01:00:46.288
You could have
at least found a way

01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:47.857
to leave me a way
to get in touch with you

01:00:47.859 --> 01:00:49.192
without having
to fucking go around

01:00:49.194 --> 01:00:50.527
all your fucking
second family.

01:00:50.529 --> 01:00:52.094
I just wanted
to talk to you.

01:00:52.096 --> 01:00:53.130
Well, now
you're talking to me.

01:00:53.132 --> 01:00:55.732
Or should I say yelling?

01:00:55.734 --> 01:00:57.233
I'm not yelling.

01:00:57.235 --> 01:00:59.701
I'm just trying
to have a conversation.

01:00:59.703 --> 01:01:03.441
Yeah.
Anything else?

01:01:08.679 --> 01:01:11.016
Do you like yourself?

01:01:13.018 --> 01:01:15.250
That's not a question
you should ask me.

01:01:15.252 --> 01:01:17.987
- I'm interested.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:01:17.989 --> 01:01:19.655
Nothing wrong
with me.

01:01:19.657 --> 01:01:24.362
Probably not in your eyes,
but I'm fine.

01:01:29.034 --> 01:01:31.000
Well, it's... I got this bloke
coming like I said.

01:01:31.002 --> 01:01:33.902
So I got to get this stuff
out of here.

01:01:33.904 --> 01:01:38.241
Sure.
All right.

01:01:38.243 --> 01:01:40.275
Anyway, I'm glad
you came by.

01:01:40.277 --> 01:01:42.277
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:01:42.279 --> 01:01:45.982
- I'm not so sure.
- Anyway...

01:01:45.984 --> 01:01:48.784
Give us a call.
All right?

01:01:48.786 --> 01:01:50.555
Yeah.

01:01:52.958 --> 01:01:56.228
See ya.

01:03:09.768 --> 01:03:11.233
And what are you out
in Hollywood doing?

01:03:11.235 --> 01:03:12.501
Like, what movie?

01:03:12.503 --> 01:03:14.070
I'm just
having a walk.

01:03:19.578 --> 01:03:22.112
That we may roam
wherever we may want to

01:03:22.114 --> 01:03:23.112
and be ourselves.

01:03:23.114 --> 01:03:24.614
Maybe.

01:03:24.616 --> 01:03:27.750
For single-mindedness
is all powerful indeed.

01:03:27.752 --> 01:03:29.920
Yeah, for sure.
For sure.

01:03:29.922 --> 01:03:32.590
Yeah.

01:03:37.261 --> 01:03:41.463
You know there's carbon 14
in everything?

01:03:41.465 --> 01:03:44.300
When the computer
tries to read it,

01:03:44.302 --> 01:03:46.436
Everything has
too many neutrons in it.

01:03:46.438 --> 01:03:50.306
It makes you sick.

01:03:50.308 --> 01:03:53.208
I got this song I wrote

01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:55.110
called "This Is How
You Make Me Feel."

01:03:55.112 --> 01:03:57.380
It goes like this.

01:03:57.382 --> 01:03:59.248
This is how you make me feel.

01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:01.750
When life gets tough,
we keep it real.

01:04:01.752 --> 01:04:03.920
Love is enough.
The coast is clear.

01:04:03.922 --> 01:04:06.989
I need your trust.
My heart's so real.

01:04:06.991 --> 01:04:10.058
♪ This is how you ♪

01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:12.430
♪ Make me feel ♪

01:04:15.534 --> 01:04:17.233
Oh, where's your lights?

01:04:17.235 --> 01:04:23.072
Five, six, seven,
and there's a break.

01:04:23.074 --> 01:04:27.744
Goes now.
Whoa, there we go.

01:04:27.746 --> 01:04:31.282
One, two...

01:06:39.844 --> 01:06:43.014
Do you want
to come in?

01:06:56.261 --> 01:06:59.128
Sorry, I can't really...

01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:00.797
um, offer you much.

01:07:00.799 --> 01:07:04.266
But I've got some water
if you want or...

01:07:04.268 --> 01:07:07.705
You... Okay.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:18.984
Ethel died
two days ago.

01:07:32.163 --> 01:07:35.299
I'm so sorry.

01:08:01.692 --> 01:08:03.625
<i>I walk slowly towards him,</i>

01:08:03.627 --> 01:08:06.097
<i>and we're speechless.</i>

01:08:08.199 --> 01:08:11.534
<i>He pulls me into a hug,
and I feel it.</i>

01:08:11.536 --> 01:08:13.772
<i>This is my father.</i>

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.444
<i>I see his face in mine.</i>

01:08:22.045 --> 01:08:24.814
<i>And we get in his car,</i>

01:08:24.816 --> 01:08:28.184
<i>and I know that I'm safe.</i>

01:08:28.185 --> 01:08:32.558
<i>Everything bad
just floats out the window.</i>

01:08:36.661 --> 01:08:40.698
<i>Do you think
we look at all alike?</i>

01:08:44.201 --> 01:08:46.734
I think here we do.

01:08:46.737 --> 01:08:49.171
Yeah, it's a big square.
