00:11.711 --> 00:13.545
COUNCILMAN:
Good morning.

00:13.580 --> 00:17.182
Today we celebrate
the new Los Angeles.

00:17.217 --> 00:19.618
(applause and cheering)

00:19.653 --> 00:21.420
This generation, our generation.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.388
We held our phones in our hands

00:23.423 --> 00:25.090
and we thought,

00:25.125 --> 00:27.092
by using social media,
we were making a difference.

00:27.127 --> 00:31.563
We became addicts,
getting high off the followers.

00:31.598 --> 00:33.131
And we all know what Jay said
you can do

00:33.166 --> 00:35.267
with your hashtags and retweets.

00:35.302 --> 00:36.701
(laughing and applause)

00:36.736 --> 00:37.702
But you...

00:37.737 --> 00:40.605
you were the ones who
put down your phones,

00:40.640 --> 00:42.674
got into the streets
and met your neighbors,

00:42.709 --> 00:44.776
cleaned the beaches
and the parks.

00:44.811 --> 00:46.445
You fed your brothers
and sisters

00:46.480 --> 00:49.314
who did not have the means
to feed themselves.

00:49.349 --> 00:51.583
You made L.A. more beautiful.

00:51.618 --> 00:54.219
You made L.A. shine.

00:54.254 --> 00:56.455
(cheering, applause)

00:57.491 --> 00:59.324
Thank you.

00:59.359 --> 01:01.860
Thank you for your service.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.161
So how'd I do?

01:03.196 --> 01:04.362
MAN:
Good party, sir.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.797
If this political
thing doesn't pan out,

01:05.832 --> 01:07.433
you've a career in event
planning waiting.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.203
(tires screeching)

01:11.238 --> 01:12.871
Eyes up.
What's going on?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.206
Sir, we need you
in the vehicle now.

01:18.445 --> 01:19.578
Bomb!

01:27.187 --> 01:30.122
(car alarms blaring)

01:30.157 --> 01:31.657
(tires screeching)

01:32.726 --> 01:35.194
Second car!

01:37.697 --> 01:38.764
Shooter!

01:41.168 --> 01:43.302
(tires squealing)

01:46.406 --> 01:48.407
Newton.

02:32.619 --> 02:35.320
Good morning.
Morning.

02:35.355 --> 02:37.756
I got up early so I thought
I'd bring you some breakfast.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.192
Wow. Thank you.

02:40.227 --> 02:43.795
So I got bagels,
but then I didn't know

02:43.830 --> 02:45.397
if you were
gonna like bagels,

02:45.432 --> 02:47.299
but at that point
I was already committed

02:47.334 --> 02:48.867
to this whole carb genre,

02:48.902 --> 02:51.836
so I got donuts and then...

02:51.871 --> 02:53.338
(laughs)

02:53.373 --> 02:54.739
You know what?

02:54.774 --> 02:56.374
This is weird.

02:56.409 --> 02:58.644
Um, me barging in
with all this food.

02:59.446 --> 03:02.214
Um, happy breakfast.

03:02.249 --> 03:03.582
I'm just gonna go.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.650
(laughing):
Stop.

03:05.685 --> 03:08.820
Please. Let's eat.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.755
I'm not usually
like this.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.724
I don't want
to come off as...

03:12.759 --> 03:15.460
The girl who only eats carbs?

03:15.495 --> 03:17.796
(chuckles)

03:17.831 --> 03:21.800
I know that I was the one that
said that I needed some time.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.269
I just moved here,

03:24.304 --> 03:26.304
and I wanted to
take things slow.

03:26.339 --> 03:27.572
But...

03:27.607 --> 03:29.507
But?

03:29.542 --> 03:33.411
(chuckles) Am I
just bugging you?

03:33.446 --> 03:34.813
God, I am that girl.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.963
(softly):
I also got croissants.

03:57.504 --> 03:58.971
What do we got?

04:00.006 --> 04:02.941
Huh, huh, huh?
What do you think?

04:02.976 --> 04:04.876
(whistles)

04:04.911 --> 04:06.811
SAM: See what happens
when you practice.

04:06.846 --> 04:08.647
Yeah, I'm what they call
a natural shooter,

04:08.682 --> 04:10.582
so it doesn't matter if the
lights are on, lights are off,

04:10.617 --> 04:11.850
eyes open, eyes closed--
when I shoot,

04:11.885 --> 04:14.919
bad guys go ouch.

04:14.954 --> 04:16.888
(laughs)
Yeah,

04:16.923 --> 04:18.790
it's a good thing
I'm not a bad guy.

04:18.825 --> 04:19.891
(laughs)

04:19.926 --> 04:21.393
So,

04:21.428 --> 04:23.528
how are things
back home?

04:23.563 --> 04:24.729
Stuff back to normal?

04:24.764 --> 04:27.332
Yeah. You know,
for sure.

04:29.369 --> 04:30.969
I mean, you don't
have to talk about it

04:31.004 --> 04:31.870
if you don't want to.

04:31.905 --> 04:34.939
No, I mean, things are good,
you know?

04:34.974 --> 04:36.908
Good.
Yeah.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.943
I mean,

04:38.978 --> 04:42.781
I'm not gonna lie,
things aren't great, but...

04:42.816 --> 04:44.016
whatever.

04:45.485 --> 04:48.620
Well, like I said,
it's none of my business,

04:48.655 --> 04:51.723
I just thought
if you wanted to talk, then...

04:51.758 --> 04:52.957
Well, it's no big deal,
it's just the things

04:52.992 --> 04:53.958
that we used to do together--
you know,

04:53.993 --> 04:55.092
the running and the hiking
and the surfing--

04:55.128 --> 04:57.762
we're just, you know,
we're not doing 'em together.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.832
No, it just takes some time,
she was laid up.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.967
She'll get those
muscles firing.

05:03.002 --> 05:06.004
No, it's not that.
She can still do it.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.405
I mean,
not the surfing part,

05:07.440 --> 05:08.506
but the running and the hiking,

05:08.541 --> 05:11.576
she just doesn't
want to do it...

05:11.611 --> 05:15.113
she doesn't want to do it
with me.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.382
She'll come around.

05:18.418 --> 05:21.386
Yeah, I know. I guess.

05:23.423 --> 05:25.991
I know it's not my place, but
can I give you a little advice?

05:28.027 --> 05:29.894
Yeah, for sure.

05:29.929 --> 05:31.763
Don't bring it up.

05:31.798 --> 05:33.031
None of it.

05:33.066 --> 05:36.000
The biking, the hiking...

05:36.035 --> 05:39.704
She needs some time
to get there.

05:39.739 --> 05:42.541
It has to come from her,
it can't come from you.

05:43.576 --> 05:46.077
Think granite.
Be granite.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.546
Your rock-like support

05:48.581 --> 05:50.949
during these
strenuous times

05:50.984 --> 05:53.418
in these storms of life,

05:53.453 --> 05:55.720
you'll-you'll be like
the Frank to her Ocean.

05:55.755 --> 05:56.988
Yeah, now you're just
messing with me.

05:57.023 --> 05:57.722
A little bit.

05:57.757 --> 05:59.891
A little bit.
ERIC: Hey, guys,

05:59.926 --> 06:00.925
you're needed
up in Ops.

06:00.960 --> 06:01.993
All right,

06:02.028 --> 06:03.194
we're on our way up.
Uh,

06:03.229 --> 06:05.029
I saw on the cameras that drill
that you guys were doing.

06:05.064 --> 06:05.963
I'm wondering
if you think

06:05.999 --> 06:08.633
I'm ready to start shooting
in the dark?

06:10.670 --> 06:12.604
Well, you should probably talk
to Callen about that, huh?

06:12.639 --> 06:13.772
Really?

06:13.807 --> 06:14.840
Oh, yeah,

06:14.875 --> 06:16.674
he can't wait to walk you
through those drills.

06:16.709 --> 06:20.011
Awesome, a one-on-one
with Callen. Yes!

06:20.046 --> 06:21.079
I am so all over this.

06:22.982 --> 06:25.016
(chuckles)

06:27.954 --> 06:28.953
Where's Granger?

06:28.988 --> 06:29.988
I don't know.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.824
He said
he wouldn't be in today.

06:32.859 --> 06:34.092
Let's get going.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.527
NELL: There was
an attempt made

06:35.562 --> 06:36.661
on City Councilman
Tony Hill's

06:36.696 --> 06:37.662
life this morning.

06:37.697 --> 06:40.966
A bomb was thrown from a
car that then sped away.

06:45.038 --> 06:45.937
ERIC:
Directly after
the explosion,

06:45.972 --> 06:47.105
there was
a second attack.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.812
Wait, so the guy
that was shot,

06:53.847 --> 06:55.046
that was
Hill's bodyguard?

06:55.081 --> 06:56.114
Yes, that is
Mark Newton.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.615
He was pronounced
dead on scene.

06:57.650 --> 06:58.516
SAM:
It's pretty unusual

06:58.551 --> 07:00.485
for a city councilman
to have a bodyguard.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.920
NELL:
It's still unclear

07:01.955 --> 07:04.622
if there was an ongoing threat
or just a one-time occurrence.

07:04.657 --> 07:06.224
ERIC:
The other guard,

07:06.259 --> 07:09.027
Junior Sancho, was able
to secure Councilman Hill.

07:09.062 --> 07:13.097
Both Sancho and Newton worked
for Kulinda Tactical Security,

07:13.132 --> 07:16.100
a high-end
private security firm.

07:16.135 --> 07:18.970
Fun fact: "Kulinda"
actually means "to protect"

07:19.005 --> 07:20.038
in Swahili. It
kind of works out.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.507
CALLEN:
Look, I get that

07:22.542 --> 07:23.775
Councilman Hill's done
a lot of good for L.A.,

07:23.810 --> 07:25.076
but why did we
pull this case?

07:25.111 --> 07:27.045
Well, the victim
was a navy reservist.

07:28.781 --> 07:29.948
And the real reason?

07:29.983 --> 07:32.050
The councilman's father
once played football

07:32.085 --> 07:33.818
with a man who is
now a U.S. senator.

07:33.853 --> 07:35.520
So, Hetty got
a phone call.

07:35.555 --> 07:36.754
There it is.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.123
I want to take a look
at that SUV.

07:39.158 --> 07:40.057
It is still being
processed on scene.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.258
All right, Sam and I
will check that out.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.928
Deeks, why don't you take Nell,
go talk to Councilman Hill.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.198
On it.
Okay.

07:49.569 --> 07:50.802
Thank you.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.206
And you were outside
his house for a while?

07:55.241 --> 07:57.609
Yeah, a couple hours.
Granger never showed.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.878
He said he was gonna be home
all night watching the game.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.013
Yeah, maybe his plans changed.

08:02.048 --> 08:03.648
He's been missing
for three nights.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.016
Plans don't
change that much.

08:05.051 --> 08:06.718
He's been looking
pretty rough lately.

08:06.753 --> 08:07.952
Something's up.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.788
Think him and Hetty are working
on something off-the-books?

08:10.823 --> 08:13.591
That wouldn't surprise me.
(sighs)

08:13.626 --> 08:15.026
I don't like
that he missed work,

08:15.061 --> 08:16.728
that's not like him.

08:16.763 --> 08:18.530
I'll check in on him
again tonight.

08:20.567 --> 08:21.966
G...

08:22.001 --> 08:24.970
it looks like they taped some
dynamite to a bottle of rum.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.108
It's low-tech,
but it's highly effective.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.876
Big boom,

08:31.911 --> 08:33.611
lots of fire.

08:33.646 --> 08:36.114
Okay, so the first car
drops the explosive.

08:37.617 --> 08:41.119
And it causes the bodyguards
to scramble with Hill.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.754
Which pushes them
out into the open.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.222
Second car
has the shooter.

08:50.296 --> 08:53.831
All right, so the car
was right here

08:53.866 --> 08:55.033
when the shooter
unloaded.

08:55.068 --> 08:58.202
(automatic gunfire)

08:58.237 --> 09:01.172
LAPD said the first bodyguard
took Hill over there

09:01.207 --> 09:02.907
for cover from the explosion.

09:02.942 --> 09:05.310
Second bodyguard was
here when he was shot.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.844
That doesn't
make any sense.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.980
The shooter's got
line of sight towards Hill,

09:09.015 --> 09:10.916
but then he pivots
back to Newton.

09:13.753 --> 09:15.219
Could have wanted
to kill the bodyguard

09:15.254 --> 09:17.789
so he could, uh,
kidnap him easy.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.223
Yeah, but after
Newton goes down,

09:19.258 --> 09:21.593
the shooter
never fires again.

09:21.628 --> 09:24.229
Maybe Hill
wasn't the target.

09:25.264 --> 09:26.264
Maybe he was here
to kill Newton.

09:40.813 --> 09:42.780
One, two.

09:42.815 --> 09:43.815
One, three.

09:44.350 --> 09:47.285
One, two.
One, two.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.286
One.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.689
One, two.
MAN: Councilman,
you have visitors.

09:52.659 --> 09:53.625
Catch.

09:53.660 --> 09:54.459
Thanks.
Sure.

09:54.494 --> 09:57.261
(indistinct chatter,
music playing)

09:57.296 --> 09:59.163
I'm Councilman Hill.

09:59.198 --> 10:00.197
You must be with NCIS.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.133
I was told you'd be
joining the investigation.

10:02.168 --> 10:04.769
Detective Deeks, LAPD,
this is Special Agent Jones.

10:04.804 --> 10:05.703
Hi.

10:05.739 --> 10:08.139
So, uh, you get right back
after it, huh?

10:08.174 --> 10:09.307
No days off.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.108
Can't afford to.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.776
Every moment these kids
are in here,

10:11.811 --> 10:12.977
they're not
on the streets.

10:13.012 --> 10:14.212
It's a game of moments,
you know?

10:14.247 --> 10:16.080
I do, actually. I do.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.849
I gave LAPD my statement.

10:17.884 --> 10:20.785
I know it's early,
but any suspects named?

10:20.820 --> 10:23.254
We're still conducting
the investigation.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.057
Sir, may I ask what made
you hire bodyguards?

10:27.193 --> 10:29.794
We've done a lot of great
things, a lot of changes.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.129
Many people are happy,

10:31.164 --> 10:33.865
but it's also created
some vocal enemies for me.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.733
Hmm. Actually,
we have reason to believe

10:35.768 --> 10:37.235
that you were not
the intended target.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.971
That the scenario
may have been set up

10:40.006 --> 10:41.239
to take out Mr. Newton.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.741
Are you serious?

10:44.110 --> 10:45.243
They wanted to kill Mark?

10:45.278 --> 10:47.178
Were you close with Mark Newton?

10:47.213 --> 10:50.782
(sighs) Not real close,
but he was a good man.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.417
Everyone at KTS was great.

10:52.452 --> 10:56.154
Harold Irvin made his company
a... a beacon for the community.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.189
I want to help,

10:58.224 --> 11:01.059
but I have no idea why anyone
would want to kill Mark Newton.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.261
Fair enough.
Thank you for your time.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.195
All right, thanks.

11:04.230 --> 11:05.897
Thanks.
Get back in there.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.132
Hmm.

11:15.141 --> 11:17.409
Kensi?

11:18.444 --> 11:19.543
Hey.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.179
No, you don't have to stop
working out. You're fine.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.046
No.

11:22.081 --> 11:23.047
Okay.

11:23.082 --> 11:24.115
It's great to see you.

11:24.150 --> 11:25.316
Yeah, you, too.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.918
I didn't know you'd
be here today.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.219
That makes two of us.

11:28.254 --> 11:29.353
(chuckles)
So, uh,

11:29.388 --> 11:31.355
is this
your first official day back?

11:31.390 --> 11:33.424
No. Not yet.

11:33.459 --> 11:35.860
How about you,
you... you're working today?

11:35.895 --> 11:38.362
Uh, yeah. Hetty said
she might have something for me.

11:38.397 --> 11:39.363
Nice.

11:39.398 --> 11:40.398
Yeah.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.066
You have a wonderful team,
Kensi.

11:42.101 --> 11:44.001
I do. Yeah. I know.
(chuckles)

11:44.036 --> 11:46.504
Kens, you... you know
I'm not try...

11:46.539 --> 11:47.872
I have to go
to physical therapy soon.

11:47.907 --> 11:48.906
So I'm gonna start my workout.

11:48.941 --> 11:50.508
Sure.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.343
Do you need any help with the...

11:52.378 --> 11:54.379
No. I'm... I'm okay.
Thank you.

11:56.949 --> 11:58.282
Hey. Anna,
they need you up in Ops.

11:58.317 --> 12:00.284
Got it.

12:00.319 --> 12:01.319
See you, Kensi.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.453
Bye, see you.

12:02.488 --> 12:03.454
Kensi?

12:03.489 --> 12:04.956
Kensi!

12:04.991 --> 12:05.990
Hi.

12:06.025 --> 12:07.792
Hey, hi.
(chuckles)
Hey.

12:07.827 --> 12:09.026
(grunts)

12:09.062 --> 12:11.295
I didn't know you were, uh,
gonna be starting back today.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.997
I'm not.
Oh.

12:13.032 --> 12:13.998
I'm just working out.

12:14.033 --> 12:15.199
Okay.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.334
Well, you're back,

12:16.369 --> 12:17.835
you're not back. Whatever.
(chuckles)

12:17.870 --> 12:20.004
I'll, uh...

12:20.039 --> 12:21.472
It was good to see you.

12:21.507 --> 12:23.341
Thank you. You, too.
Mm-hmm.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.176
Have a good workout.
Yep!

12:29.582 --> 12:30.948
It's nice coming in
from this side of the building.

12:30.983 --> 12:31.916
Variety's the spice of life.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.951
You told Anna it was okay
to park in my spot,

12:33.986 --> 12:35.153
didn't you?
I did not.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.988
But you didn't tell
her it was not okay

12:37.023 --> 12:39.323
to park in my spot.
I did not.

12:39.358 --> 12:41.159
Hey. We have a new lead
on the shooting.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.560
Anna's waiting up in Ops.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.429
Actually, it's
just Callen.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.431
Sam, Hetty has something else
for you.

12:47.466 --> 12:48.499
Where is Hetty?

12:48.534 --> 12:50.401
I don't know.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.336
Uh, all she said this morning

12:52.371 --> 12:55.039
was that she had
one last card to play.

12:56.876 --> 12:58.877
She always does.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.313
What's up, Nell?

13:02.348 --> 13:04.582
So, LAPD's Robbery Homicide

13:04.617 --> 13:06.584
has new intel on KTS.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.453
Mm-hmm.
Apparently, they've
been hired muscle

13:09.488 --> 13:11.823
to several L.A.
criminal organizations.

13:11.858 --> 13:14.292
So, they're using their legit
private security clients

13:14.327 --> 13:16.360
as a front.
Mm-hmm.

13:16.395 --> 13:18.196
Although RHD hasn't been able
to verify this.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.431
Hmm. Well, if that's true,

13:20.466 --> 13:23.067
the link could be
what got Newton killed.

13:23.102 --> 13:26.471
Yes. And Hetty wants you
on the inside.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.440
Okay.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.443
Am I backstopped?

13:32.478 --> 13:34.412
Mm-hmm. Under
your own name.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.480
Rear Admiral Stern
has placed a call

13:36.515 --> 13:38.015
saying that you're leaving NCIS

13:38.050 --> 13:40.051
and that you're in need
of a new job.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.386
Got it.

13:42.421 --> 13:43.855
Uh, Sam?

13:43.890 --> 13:45.489
I've looked
at the résumés.

13:45.524 --> 13:46.423
Mm-hmm.

13:46.459 --> 13:49.427
KTS is filled
with SEALs, MARSOC, Delta.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.495
All dangerous, all capable.

13:51.530 --> 13:54.332
Then I should fit right in.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.399
Mm.

13:55.434 --> 13:57.001
And Sam.

13:57.036 --> 14:00.071
You know that if anyone
is dirty within KTS,

14:00.106 --> 14:02.139
they'll be suspicious of you.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.174
These guys will not be afraid
to come after you.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.492
Hey, guys.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.660
Anna.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.661
Aloha, wahine.
Eric just got a hit
on one of the cars

14:23.696 --> 14:26.063
from the shooting. We're
gonna go check it out.

14:26.098 --> 14:27.131
Oh, where is Sam?

14:27.166 --> 14:29.066
Uh, he's going
undercover in KTS.

14:29.101 --> 14:30.301
You two are on overwatch.

14:30.336 --> 14:32.203
Got it.
Got it.

14:36.642 --> 14:39.577
Okay, Eric. We're in the plaza
directly across from KTS.

14:39.612 --> 14:40.945
ERIC:
Copy that.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.380
Sam will be arriving shortly.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.381
Got it.

14:43.416 --> 14:47.585
So, now will you give it
a rest about my driving?

14:47.620 --> 14:50.354
I mean, the jury's still out,
but I will concede

14:50.389 --> 14:52.356
that we got down here
with all of our limbs intact.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.358
Which, you know, is nice.
Yeah.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.192
I'll take what I can get.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.094
But I am getting
my head molded to get

14:57.129 --> 14:58.996
that custom helmet.
(laughs)

14:59.031 --> 15:02.400
I got to say, digging
the little bonsai trees.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.035
Oh, those aren't bonsai.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.536
Oh, no?
No.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.471
They're trees trimmed
in a very specific way.

15:07.506 --> 15:08.405
It's called<i> niwaki.</i>

15:08.441 --> 15:10.675
Okay. Now, you're
just making stuff up.

15:10.710 --> 15:11.676
No. Scout's honor.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.110
You're no Boy Scout.

15:13.145 --> 15:15.012
What, so I can't be down
with their honor system?

15:15.047 --> 15:17.214
(laughing):
Okay. Fine.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.683
How is it that,
all of a sudden,

15:18.718 --> 15:21.285
you're this expert in
small Japanese trees?

15:21.320 --> 15:23.287
Because I actually spent a
summer down here in high school,

15:23.322 --> 15:24.588
working with my buddy,
Matt Akagi.

15:24.623 --> 15:26.223
Okay...

15:26.258 --> 15:28.559
Look. I don't know what you're
setting me up for right now,

15:28.594 --> 15:30.962
but I'm not buying it.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.430
In fact, his grandfather,
Mm-hmm?

15:32.465 --> 15:33.597
Mr. Akagi,

15:33.632 --> 15:35.666
planted all those trees
for the city.

15:35.701 --> 15:37.401
Mr. Akagi.
Yeah.

15:37.436 --> 15:38.436
Really?

15:38.471 --> 15:40.304
Yeah. It was
in the 1940s,

15:40.339 --> 15:42.106
Mr. Akagi moved his
whole family down here,

15:42.141 --> 15:44.575
'cause Leimert Park was one
of the only places in L.A.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.078
that Japanese people
could buy houses.

15:47.113 --> 15:51.148
Mm. And the punch line is?

15:51.183 --> 15:53.551
What? This is real?

15:53.586 --> 15:56.487
You really took care
of these gardens for a summer?

15:56.522 --> 15:58.256
Scout's honor.

16:03.362 --> 16:04.996
Guys. Sam's pulling up now.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.667
All right. Thanks, Eric.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.471
Mr. Irvin.

16:13.506 --> 16:14.638
How are you?

16:14.673 --> 16:16.340
Sam Hanna.

16:16.375 --> 16:17.742
Hello, Sam.

16:17.777 --> 16:21.312
Uh, first of all, I want to say
I'm sorry for your loss.

16:21.347 --> 16:24.515
Thank you. He was a good man.

16:24.550 --> 16:25.783
A very good man.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.085
Well, I'm here to talk
to you about the...

16:28.120 --> 16:29.620
You like coffee, Sam?

16:29.655 --> 16:31.288
Yes, sir.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.790
Every morning I get a cup
from the shop down the street.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.792
Let's walk and talk,
kill two birds. What do you say?

16:34.827 --> 16:37.161
I could always use
a good cup of coffee.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.797
Didn't say anything
about it being good.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.665
(chuckles)

16:41.700 --> 16:43.401
Admiral Stern doesn't
make it a habit

16:43.436 --> 16:45.603
of calling me to recommend men.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.705
Yeah, well, he has
a little too much time

16:47.740 --> 16:50.508
on his hands since,
uh, the divorce.

16:53.112 --> 16:55.112
You've built an incredible
business here.

16:55.147 --> 16:56.680
We're fortunate.

16:56.715 --> 16:58.516
KTS is highly profitable.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.751
We could be in Century City
or Beverly Hills,

17:00.786 --> 17:03.521
but it's important
we stay in the community.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.723
I agree.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.725
Why's it important to<i> you?</i>

17:07.760 --> 17:10.828
I hire strong,
successful, good people.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.097
The types of men and women
that the youth

17:13.132 --> 17:15.599
in the neighborhood
need to see, need to meet.

17:15.634 --> 17:16.834
Mm-hmm.

17:16.869 --> 17:17.968
Men like you, Sam.

17:18.004 --> 17:20.704
That's who I hope these
kids out here aspire to be.

17:20.739 --> 17:23.607
KTS is active
in the community.

17:23.642 --> 17:24.742
Absolutely.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.078
School supply day, sneaker day,

17:27.113 --> 17:30.281
book day. Few more.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.216
Lots of our high
profile clients,

17:32.251 --> 17:34.785
when they find out what
we do, they help us out.

17:34.820 --> 17:35.686
SAM:
That's great.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.421
Get that credit card ready,
Mr. Irvin.

17:37.456 --> 17:39.523
Those LeBron Soldiers
are as good as mine.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.125
You get chemistry
up to an "A"?

17:41.160 --> 17:43.194
Nah, he's still
at a B-minus, Mr. I.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.195
Yeah, but...

17:44.230 --> 17:46.764
we have an exam on Friday
that I'm gonna crush.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.300
B-minuses
don't buy LeBron Soldiers.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.635
(laughter)

17:53.205 --> 17:55.506
Sam, the admiral tells me
you're looking to make a change.

17:55.541 --> 17:58.876
You think KTS is
a place you'd fit in?

17:58.911 --> 18:00.744
Most definitely, sir.

18:00.779 --> 18:02.746
Let's give it a try.

18:02.781 --> 18:05.149
Either of us doesn't think
it's gonna work out,

18:05.184 --> 18:06.417
no harm, no foul.

18:06.452 --> 18:09.120
Thank you for the opportunity.

18:18.664 --> 18:21.599
I get why Eric lost
the drive-by car down here.

18:21.634 --> 18:24.802
Yeah. Lot of warehouses
and garages to ditch it in.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.370
Yeah.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.472
Hey, this weekend, how about...

18:28.507 --> 18:29.707
How about what?

18:29.742 --> 18:32.476
(laughs) No.
You know what, never mind.

18:32.511 --> 18:34.178
No. Now you got to tell me.

18:34.213 --> 18:36.580
No. Uh-huh.
I'll just go another time.

18:36.615 --> 18:37.915
What's up?

18:37.950 --> 18:39.683
Nothing.

18:39.718 --> 18:41.752
Look, I-I just realized

18:41.787 --> 18:44.755
that this is totally
not your kind of thing.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.625
And we are definitely not
at a point of our relationship

18:47.660 --> 18:49.226
where we feel bound

18:49.261 --> 18:51.362
to do a bunch of stuff
we really don't want to do

18:51.397 --> 18:53.597
just because
we feel obligated,

18:53.632 --> 18:56.534
which-- side note-- I'm really
not good at doing, so...

18:56.569 --> 18:58.169
Maybe I'll surprise you.

18:58.204 --> 19:00.304
Look. Where do you want to go?

19:00.339 --> 19:01.839
Carlsbad.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.507
Carlsbad?

19:03.542 --> 19:05.709
Like near San Diego, Carlsbad?

19:05.744 --> 19:06.810
Yes.

19:06.845 --> 19:09.380
And I told you...
What is... What is in Carlsbad?

19:09.415 --> 19:10.414
Really?

19:10.450 --> 19:13.651
Like... Like Carlsbad itself
is not a deal breaker?

19:13.686 --> 19:15.653
You do know it's, like,
two hours away.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.655
Look, if you want to go
to Carlsbad this weekend,

19:17.690 --> 19:18.923
let's go.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.959
(chuckles)
Okay.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.194
All right.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.828
Okay.
Now will you tell me

19:24.863 --> 19:26.297
what's in Carlsbad?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.233
LEGOLAND

19:29.268 --> 19:31.669
and an outlet mall.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.704
LEGOLAND?

19:39.612 --> 19:41.612
Hey, man.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.848
Sam Hanna.

19:44.883 --> 19:47.318
Supposed to be working the
detail with you guys today.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.686
Have a seat.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.255
That's Sancho.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.724
I'm Byron.

19:53.759 --> 19:54.858
Good to meet you.

19:54.893 --> 19:56.794
SAM:
Yeah. Same here.

19:57.830 --> 20:01.265
Look. Guys, I, uh...

20:01.300 --> 20:03.267
I heard about your brother.

20:03.302 --> 20:04.635
I'm sorry for your loss.

20:04.670 --> 20:05.970
(sighs)
Thanks, man.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.938
Newt was a great dude.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.840
SANCHO:
Okay, everybody, listen up.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.409
Today we've got Poppy Gold,

20:12.444 --> 20:15.279
a YouTube star doing an
appearance at an art gallery.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.848
She's got 1.7 million
subscribers

20:17.883 --> 20:21.252
and a good 10,000 of them
are solid haters.

20:21.287 --> 20:22.553
Now, her management says

20:22.588 --> 20:24.922
they have had threats
at past appearances,

20:24.957 --> 20:26.023
so be alert.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.560
But mainly, we're looking
at crowd control scenarios.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.462
Linder, you'll be
in the Chase SUV

20:31.497 --> 20:33.964
parked in the alley
behind the store.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.466
Roberts, you've got
the principal's SUV,

20:35.501 --> 20:36.567
doing the drop-off.

20:36.602 --> 20:38.802
Hanna, you're with me,

20:38.837 --> 20:41.839
and Byron, inside.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.107
Copy that.

20:43.142 --> 20:46.610
We'll meet in the parking lot in
an hour to pick up the client.

20:46.645 --> 20:47.878
Any questions?

20:47.913 --> 20:49.313
We're good.

20:49.348 --> 20:51.349
Let's roll.

20:55.854 --> 20:57.855
DEEKS: All right,
what do you got, Eric?

20:57.890 --> 20:59.957
So, the first time
I ran backgrounds

20:59.992 --> 21:03.027
on the KTS guys, nothing out
of the ordinary came up.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.395
Right.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.696
But you didn't call us
to tell us

21:05.731 --> 21:06.830
you got more of nothing, right?

21:06.865 --> 21:07.998
Right.

21:08.033 --> 21:11.535
I think Junior Sancho
is in a gang.

21:11.570 --> 21:14.004
Or was in a gang.
Can you un-gang yourself?

21:14.039 --> 21:15.906
Absolutely.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.041
Junior Sancho was arrested

21:17.076 --> 21:18.609
three times as a minor,

21:18.644 --> 21:20.444
which is why
I didn't see it at first.

21:20.479 --> 21:22.980
L.A. Sheriffs had him listed
as "gang affiliated"

21:23.015 --> 21:24.948
with the Arlington Treys.

21:24.983 --> 21:27.885
And then he enlisted
in the marines.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.854
Decorated service record,
honorable discharge.

21:30.889 --> 21:33.023
Looks like he left
gang life behind him.

21:33.058 --> 21:34.859
Or he didn't.

21:36.995 --> 21:37.995
Where you going, Sancho?

21:39.465 --> 21:40.931
Nowhere.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.937
Him and his partner
must have been really close.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.440
Looks like he took it hard.
Huh.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.076
I wish I could say
he's usually cooler,

21:52.111 --> 21:54.912
but he's always wound tight.
Hmm.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.448
Never leaves before
detail, though.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.516
Well, we've got an hour.
Maybe he was just hungry.

21:59.551 --> 22:01.785
Nah, not Sancho.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.687
An hour to go,
(scoffs)

22:03.722 --> 22:06.123
he'd be checking
and triple-checking

22:06.158 --> 22:08.959
plans, equipment,
vehicles.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.462
Hmm.

22:11.497 --> 22:12.863
Maybe he just needed
to clear his head.

22:12.898 --> 22:14.531
Hmm, maybe.

22:14.566 --> 22:17.101
Hey, our gym's
state of the art.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.936
I wanted to get a lift in
before we got to go,

22:18.971 --> 22:21.405
if you want to join.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.474
All right, I'll catch up.
Cool.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.442
Let me call my wife.
Ah.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.043
I didn't know I was
gonna have a job so quick.

22:26.078 --> 22:27.645
(both chuckle)

22:36.455 --> 22:37.755
(quietly):
Deeks, Nell,

22:37.790 --> 22:39.823
Sancho just went out
of the back door.

22:39.858 --> 22:40.858
DEEKS:
Yeah, we just saw him.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.526
All right,
we're following him.

22:43.929 --> 22:46.764
Uh...

22:46.799 --> 22:48.065
Quick call.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.534
Yeah, I left a message.
She wasn't home.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.002
Let's go check out
that gym.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.771
Cool.

22:55.140 --> 22:58.742
¶ I sit back and I wonder if
the man gonna call my number ¶

22:58.777 --> 23:00.878
¶ Like, will I rise
or just fall under? ¶

23:00.913 --> 23:03.680
We got Harold Irvin.

23:03.715 --> 23:04.848
Mm-hmm.
Put it up.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.984
Sound's coming in.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.819
¶ I'm livin' life
to the fullest ¶

23:08.854 --> 23:09.820
NELL:
Ooh.

23:09.855 --> 23:10.888
That's loud.

23:10.923 --> 23:11.955
That's because
he's blasting music

23:11.990 --> 23:13.657
the second he
started talking.

23:13.692 --> 23:15.859
This guy doesn't miss a beat.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.961
¶ So I keep it funky
like Parliament... ¶

23:17.996 --> 23:19.563
(engine starts)

23:23.802 --> 23:25.169
DEEKS: All right,
we're gonna stick with Sancho.

23:25.204 --> 23:26.603
Eric, you keep
tabs on Ervin

23:26.638 --> 23:27.838
in that Ford Raptor.

23:27.873 --> 23:29.640
ERIC:
I'm on it.

23:29.675 --> 23:31.608
Hey, maybe they didn't
ditch the cars

23:31.643 --> 23:32.843
from the drive-by
shooting.

23:32.878 --> 23:34.745
Maybe they're chopping
them up instead.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.981
(power tool whirs in distance)

23:37.916 --> 23:39.817
Hey.

23:45.224 --> 23:46.657
(camera clicks)

23:46.692 --> 23:47.958
Eric, I'm sending you
a photo.

23:47.993 --> 23:49.793
Cross-reference it
with the crime lab photos

23:49.828 --> 23:51.161
from LAPD.

23:51.196 --> 23:52.997
I'm on it.
Doing it now.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.107
¶ ¶

24:07.613 --> 24:09.747
It's a match
to the shooter's car.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.690
(power tool whirs)

24:22.094 --> 24:23.727
(door squeaks)

24:26.131 --> 24:28.532
(indistinct chatter in distance)

24:56.328 --> 24:57.127
In position.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.129
Two guys in the center.
On my mark.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.965
CALLEN:
One, two...

25:02.000 --> 25:04.668
Federal agents!
Put your tools down.

25:04.703 --> 25:06.703
Put your hands behind
your back slowly.

25:06.738 --> 25:09.640
Look at that, the cars
from the drive-by.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.775
CALLEN: Doing time
for chopping up cars,

25:11.810 --> 25:13.844
that's easy-- you make a move
towards us, that's life.

25:13.879 --> 25:16.113
They look too smart
to go away for life.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.048
Right?
Yeah, we'll see.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.983
Here's what's gonna happen.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.052
If you're smart, you put
your hands behind your head,

25:22.087 --> 25:23.887
and you move to us.

25:23.922 --> 25:25.656
If you're dumb,
you stay where you are.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.124
Let's go.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.726
Right here.
Turn around.

25:31.763 --> 25:34.998
One out of two is not bad.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.567
Don't do anything stupid.

25:39.905 --> 25:40.838
(grunts)

25:42.140 --> 25:43.607
(automatic gunfire)

25:59.758 --> 26:01.792
(both grunting)

26:08.734 --> 26:09.733
Have you ever been to LEGOLAND?

26:25.217 --> 26:27.150
Firas Barmuk is the guy
who paid them

26:27.185 --> 26:29.786
to chop up the two cars in
the shooting that killed Newton.

26:29.821 --> 26:31.722
That name sounds
Syrian.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.290
Uh, yeah, Barmuk was born here,

26:33.325 --> 26:35.826
but he has ties to a Syrian
money-laundering group

26:35.861 --> 26:38.295
that's been making a big push
into L.A. lately.

26:38.330 --> 26:41.198
Why would a money-laundering
group want to kill Newton?

26:41.233 --> 26:42.299
What's the link?

26:42.334 --> 26:44.368
Oh, well, there's not a link,

26:44.403 --> 26:46.837
per se, more like a...
like a threat.

26:46.872 --> 26:48.705
Like a thin threat.
Kind of like a spider web

26:48.740 --> 26:49.840
kind of thing that...

26:49.875 --> 26:51.942
CALLEN: Eric.
Focusing.

26:51.977 --> 26:55.078
Anyway, I wasn't able to link
Barmuk to the victim, Newton,

26:55.113 --> 26:57.014
but I did find this.

26:57.049 --> 27:00.751
LAPD arrested this man,
Sayid Lajani, in a sting.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.919
Now, he's part of that same
Syrian money-laundering group,

27:02.954 --> 27:04.020
but get this.

27:04.055 --> 27:07.724
He was arrested with members
of the Arlington Treys.

27:07.759 --> 27:10.794
That's the same gang
that Sancho at KTS

27:10.829 --> 27:12.796
was a member of before
he enlisted in the marines.

27:12.831 --> 27:14.798
If KTS was working
with the Arlington Treys,

27:14.833 --> 27:16.800
and they had a deal with Syria
that went sideways...

27:16.835 --> 27:18.802
The Syrians would want revenge.

27:18.837 --> 27:20.237
Yeah, they decide to go
after KTS because

27:20.272 --> 27:21.738
they were the muscle
behind the Treys.

27:21.773 --> 27:22.773
And they kill Newton.

27:22.808 --> 27:23.741
Hold on, guys.

27:23.776 --> 27:26.376
I was searching through
KTS' phone records,

27:26.411 --> 27:29.146
and... huh.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.915
It looks like Newton,
Sancho and Firas Barmuk

27:31.950 --> 27:34.184
were all in contact
with one man.

27:34.219 --> 27:37.354
His name's D'Andre Linton.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.488
What do we know about him?

27:38.524 --> 27:39.723
No arrests, but he was
kicked out of his high school

27:39.758 --> 27:43.427
a couple years ago for running
a sports gambling operation.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.796
D'Andre could be
the middleman.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.130
Do you have an address?

27:47.165 --> 27:48.832
Sending it to your phones now.

27:48.867 --> 27:49.900
Nice work, Eric.

27:49.935 --> 27:53.070
It's just what I do.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.139
(indistinct chatter)

28:01.513 --> 28:03.814
Must be hard
getting back to work

28:03.849 --> 28:05.849
right after
everything happened.

28:05.884 --> 28:06.716
Wasn't hard.

28:06.752 --> 28:08.752
I asked to be put
on the schedule today.

28:08.787 --> 28:10.054
Mm.

28:11.823 --> 28:14.224
Okay. But if you ever
need someone to talk to...

28:14.259 --> 28:16.460
Look...

28:16.495 --> 28:18.195
I don't trust you,
Hanna.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.363
Newton gets killed,

28:20.398 --> 28:22.232
and you come waltzing
right in.

28:22.267 --> 28:24.368
Don't feel right.

28:27.939 --> 28:29.873
Byron, how you looking?

28:29.908 --> 28:31.875
My section's
good to go.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.310
All right, Roberts is
circling off Melrose.

28:33.345 --> 28:34.444
We're live in five minutes.

28:34.479 --> 28:35.913
All right.

28:40.919 --> 28:44.755
There it is, 4118.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.469
Federal agents.

28:59.504 --> 29:01.371
D'Andre Linton,

29:01.406 --> 29:03.273
we'd like to ask you
some questions.

29:03.308 --> 29:07.811
D'Andre ain't there.
He left.

29:11.183 --> 29:14.518
Shh. Come here.

29:14.553 --> 29:15.919
What's your name?

29:15.954 --> 29:18.421
Joey.
Who are you?

29:18.456 --> 29:20.857
Ah. I'm Anna.

29:20.892 --> 29:22.325
I'm a federal agent.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.862
Can you tell me when
did D'Andre leave?

29:25.897 --> 29:27.964
When those men
came for him.

29:27.999 --> 29:29.933
They the ones that
busted his door.

29:29.968 --> 29:32.936
But D'Andre's fast.
He ran.

29:32.971 --> 29:35.172
And when did that happen?

29:35.207 --> 29:37.775
Why are you asking
about D'Andre?

29:39.177 --> 29:40.310
You like him, don't you?

29:40.345 --> 29:42.946
He doesn't treat me
like a kid.

29:42.981 --> 29:44.981
He gives me
his old kicks.

29:45.016 --> 29:46.850
They don't fit yet,
but they gonna.

29:46.885 --> 29:48.985
I clean 'em up
real good.

29:49.020 --> 29:51.054
Do you know where
he might have gone?

29:51.089 --> 29:52.189
Man, I'm talking
to the lady here.

29:53.592 --> 29:55.959
Joey, can you tell me

29:55.994 --> 29:57.260
if this was one
of the men

29:57.295 --> 29:58.929
that came for D'Andre?

29:58.964 --> 30:02.065
Yeah, that's him.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.266
He's the one that
kicked the door.

30:03.301 --> 30:06.236
Thank you, Joey.
It's a big help.

30:06.271 --> 30:09.539
You're not gonna hurt
D'Andre, are you?

30:09.574 --> 30:10.574
No.

30:12.611 --> 30:14.911
You done talking
to the lady?
Maybe.

30:14.946 --> 30:16.413
What's it to you?

30:16.448 --> 30:17.981
(chuckles)

30:18.016 --> 30:19.950
Thank you.

30:23.521 --> 30:25.522
(pop music playing,
crowd shouting indistinctly)

30:32.264 --> 30:35.065
Hey.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.100
Hey, fam.

30:41.306 --> 30:43.039
You're the best, Poppy.

30:43.074 --> 30:45.008
Thanks, fam.

30:46.244 --> 30:48.979
Hey, want me
to sign 'em, fam?

30:49.014 --> 30:51.047
You don't even
remember, do you?

30:51.082 --> 30:53.183
What?
You asked for these,

30:53.218 --> 30:54.451
so I sent them
to you for free.

30:54.486 --> 30:57.954
And then you do
a 30-minute slam blog

30:57.989 --> 30:58.955
about how my jeans
are lame.

30:58.990 --> 31:01.091
It's not my fault
your designs are last-minute.

31:01.126 --> 31:04.995
My entire company went
bankrupt because of you.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.230
(alarmed cries, gasps)

31:07.265 --> 31:09.466
Stop it!

31:09.501 --> 31:11.101
You okay?
Yeah, thank you.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.905
And that's why you hire
the pros

31:14.940 --> 31:16.907
to watch your ass, fam.

31:16.942 --> 31:18.341
(sighs)

31:18.376 --> 31:19.576
MAN: Yeah, Poppy!
(cheers and applause)

31:22.180 --> 31:24.114
Yeah, Poppy.

31:27.018 --> 31:28.585
NELL:
<i> Man, these KTS guys are pros.</i>

31:28.620 --> 31:30.587
Fast seamless moves.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.188
If they are working
with the Arlington Treys...

31:32.223 --> 31:34.124
That is
<i>muy no bueno.</i>
<i> Sí.</i>

31:34.159 --> 31:36.092
Although they did just avoid
what could have been

31:36.127 --> 31:37.928
the next
Pigeon Dunk riot.

31:37.963 --> 31:38.862
I'm sorry, what?
Really?

31:38.898 --> 31:41.531
Respect the history.
You got to look that up.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.066
Although,
what I don't understand

31:43.101 --> 31:44.701
is all of this.

31:44.736 --> 31:45.702
Like, what is that?

31:45.737 --> 31:48.071
So-so she films herself
shopping,

31:48.106 --> 31:50.273
and then, what, people
show up to take a selfie,

31:50.308 --> 31:51.541
like she's Beyoncé?

31:51.576 --> 31:53.510
No, she doesn't
film herself shopping.

31:53.545 --> 31:55.345
She does "unboxings."

31:57.182 --> 31:59.416
Wh-What is...
What the hell's "unboxing"?

31:59.451 --> 32:00.517
Maybe you should
look it up.

32:00.552 --> 32:03.286
Oh... Oh, touché,
Nellasaurus.

32:03.321 --> 32:05.989
So she orders clothes
and shoes to her house,

32:06.024 --> 32:07.290
and when they arrive,

32:07.325 --> 32:08.692
she takes them out
of the box,

32:08.727 --> 32:11.594
films herself talking about
the clothes and the shoes.

32:11.629 --> 32:13.396
Hmm.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.699
I feel like I'm more confused
<i>after</i> you explained it.

32:15.734 --> 32:18.034
It's really not
that complicated...
No, no, no. No more words.

32:18.069 --> 32:19.569
'Cause you know why?
There are some things that

32:19.604 --> 32:21.705
Deeks does not need
to understand.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.239
What do you got, Eric?

32:23.274 --> 32:24.641
ERIC:
Callen, I just got a hit

32:24.676 --> 32:27.010
on Harold Irvin's credit card
at a parking meter.

32:27.045 --> 32:28.478
He's parked on Degnan next to

32:28.513 --> 32:30.680
the Barbara Morrison
Performing Arts Center.

32:30.715 --> 32:31.681
We're on our way.

32:31.716 --> 32:33.483
Have Deeks and Nell stay on Sam.

32:33.518 --> 32:35.485
Copy that.

32:48.266 --> 32:49.967
(footfalls nearby)

33:03.048 --> 33:04.414
(footfalls approaching)

33:04.449 --> 33:06.649
ANNA: Federal agents.
CALLEN: Drop the gun!

33:06.684 --> 33:08.218
D'ANDRE:
Don't come any closer!

33:08.253 --> 33:09.586
Not any closer!

33:09.621 --> 33:11.421
D'Andre, put down the gun.

33:11.456 --> 33:13.156
Please, just stop.

33:13.191 --> 33:15.158
Is Irvin here with you?

33:15.193 --> 33:17.694
No.
I need you to listen
to me, D'Andre,

33:17.729 --> 33:19.696
very carefully.

33:19.731 --> 33:22.365
You cannot raise
that gun, do you hear me?

33:22.400 --> 33:23.700
You put your gun away, please.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.435
I can't do that.

33:25.470 --> 33:26.770
Drop the gun, D'Andre.

33:26.805 --> 33:29.739
(inhales sharply)
D'Andre, look at me.

33:29.774 --> 33:31.574
Look at me.

33:31.609 --> 33:33.643
I need you to set down that gun.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.378
Okay?

33:35.413 --> 33:36.379
Don't raise it.

33:36.414 --> 33:38.615
You set it down,

33:38.650 --> 33:42.619
and no one gets hurt,
I promise you.

33:42.654 --> 33:45.589
Just got to trust me.

33:59.671 --> 34:02.339
This whole thing is my fault.

34:04.442 --> 34:08.545
It's my fault.

34:08.580 --> 34:12.782
(sobbing)

34:12.817 --> 34:13.817
(sighs deeply)

34:33.138 --> 34:36.539
Mr. Newton and Mr. Sancho,
they're like my big brothers.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.408
Why'd Barmuk
come after Newton?

34:38.443 --> 34:39.809
'Cause of me.

34:39.844 --> 34:40.743
This is all on me.

34:40.779 --> 34:44.547
Mr. Newton was just trying
to protect me.

34:44.582 --> 34:46.716
I-I screwed up,
I needed money.

34:47.819 --> 34:51.187
I agreed to be a lookout
on a cash run

34:51.222 --> 34:52.655
for those Syrian dudes.

34:52.690 --> 34:55.391
When Mr. Newton found out
what I was gonna do,

34:55.426 --> 34:56.425
he went to Barmuk.

34:56.461 --> 34:59.162
Told him I was out,
told him to stay away from me.

34:59.197 --> 35:01.498
When was that?
Two days ago.

35:01.533 --> 35:04.501
Then they killed him today.

35:05.837 --> 35:09.372
Barmuk ain't stopping,
he came after me today.

35:09.407 --> 35:11.341
Why did you run here?

35:14.412 --> 35:16.913
Mr. Newton and Mr. Sancho
said this place is safe.

35:16.948 --> 35:20.250
If I ever needed a place
to lay low, to come here.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.586
Oh, that sounds like some good
guys to have in your corner.

35:23.821 --> 35:25.822
Yeah, man.

35:25.857 --> 35:26.823
All those guys ever did

35:26.858 --> 35:29.926
was protect me,
and it got Mr. Newton killed.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.461
What about Irvin?

35:31.496 --> 35:34.164
Today was the first day
I met Mr. Irvin.

35:35.533 --> 35:36.866
Sancho told him about you.

35:36.901 --> 35:38.835
About what happened.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.303
Yeah.

35:41.272 --> 35:43.173
Now Irvin's after Barmuk.

35:43.208 --> 35:45.208
D'Andre?

35:45.243 --> 35:48.478
I think Mr. Irvin's
gonna go kill him.

35:48.513 --> 35:50.814
He's gonna kill Barmuk.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.185
CALLEN:
Yeah, I'm here with D'Andre now.

35:55.220 --> 35:56.586
So Sancho and Byron are clean.

35:56.621 --> 35:58.721
KTS wasn't working
with the Arlington Treys?

35:58.756 --> 36:00.290
No, and Irvin knows
that Barmuk killed Newton.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.892
Irvin's gonna take him out.

36:02.927 --> 36:03.927
Yeah.

36:03.962 --> 36:05.929
Where?
D'Andre thinks

36:05.964 --> 36:07.730
Barmuk's probably laying low
at his girlfriend's place

36:07.765 --> 36:09.232
on 6th Avenue.

36:09.267 --> 36:10.466
Anna and I are about
ten minutes out.

36:10.501 --> 36:11.901
I alerted LAPD.

36:11.936 --> 36:14.437
All right,
Nell and I are on it.

36:14.472 --> 36:15.238
I'm going now.

36:23.615 --> 36:25.582
(Barmuk grunting)

36:28.286 --> 36:29.919
SAM: Irvin! Irvin!
Stop right there, Sam.

36:29.954 --> 36:31.788
Irvin.
Where you going, Barmuk?

36:31.823 --> 36:32.789
(sirens wailing)
This doesn't concern you.

36:32.824 --> 36:35.425
Irvin. Irvin.
This lowlife killed a good man.

36:35.460 --> 36:36.826
Shot him in the street.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.962
Why does he deserve any better
than what Newton got?

36:38.997 --> 36:40.463
(tires screech)

36:40.498 --> 36:41.598
I got this, I got this.

36:41.633 --> 36:42.465
Hold up.
He's with us.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.499
OFFICER:
All right.

36:43.534 --> 36:44.867
Irvin,

36:44.902 --> 36:46.236
throw the gun away.

36:46.271 --> 36:46.970
This man is not worth it.

36:47.005 --> 36:47.971
Yeah, but doing him

36:48.006 --> 36:49.639
would be worth it to me.

36:49.674 --> 36:50.974
Look.

36:51.009 --> 36:52.442
It's not right.

36:54.545 --> 36:55.645
Brother!

36:55.680 --> 36:57.547
Look around you.

36:58.716 --> 36:59.882
Look at all these people.

36:59.917 --> 37:01.517
Look at these kids.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.920
Showing these people
what's right, being an example,

37:03.955 --> 37:04.921
that's who you are.

37:04.956 --> 37:06.790
That's how you've lived.

37:08.393 --> 37:09.993
Right until this moment.

37:10.028 --> 37:13.263
That's exactly what
they've seen you as,

37:13.298 --> 37:15.865
an example.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.301
Don't undo all that.

37:18.336 --> 37:19.669
Don't change.

37:19.704 --> 37:22.705
Be that light.

37:22.740 --> 37:26.276
Be that beacon.

37:26.311 --> 37:27.644
For them.

37:33.718 --> 37:37.754
Put the gun down.

37:37.789 --> 37:38.955
Put it down, Irvin.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.692
(grunts)
Come on, all
right, all right,

37:42.727 --> 37:43.693
all right,
all right.

37:43.728 --> 37:45.428
(indistinct radio transmission)

37:47.899 --> 37:48.965
Irvin.

37:50.635 --> 37:52.669
All right.

38:10.755 --> 38:13.323
Hey, uh, Kensi.

38:13.358 --> 38:16.492
Hi, Nate.
Hi.

38:16.527 --> 38:17.794
What are you doing here?

38:17.829 --> 38:19.862
Hetty asked me
to come in, so...

38:19.897 --> 38:21.631
Cool, did she have
an assignment for you?

38:21.666 --> 38:22.632
Yep.

38:22.667 --> 38:23.633
She tell you what it is?

38:23.668 --> 38:24.801
Yeah.

38:24.836 --> 38:25.802
And?

38:25.837 --> 38:26.836
(chuckles)

38:30.875 --> 38:32.041
I'm your assignment.

38:32.076 --> 38:34.811
(softly):
Yeah.

38:34.846 --> 38:38.681
Uh... here.

38:38.716 --> 38:40.483
Wow.

38:40.518 --> 38:42.919
It's a good thing I came in
tonight to work out again.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.521
How did that go?

38:46.557 --> 38:47.824
Good.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.092
Great, actually.

38:49.127 --> 38:51.127
I mean, I feel strong,
really strong.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.362
That's good.

38:52.397 --> 38:53.563
Yeah.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.598
I'm ready to come back,
you know? It's time.

38:55.633 --> 38:57.767
Yeah.

38:57.802 --> 38:58.968
Why rush it, though?

38:59.003 --> 39:00.403
I mean...
(chuckles)

39:00.438 --> 39:01.704
Right?

39:01.739 --> 39:03.640
I don't feel like
I'm rushing it.

39:05.443 --> 39:07.009
Kensi, I read your file.

39:07.044 --> 39:08.378
You suffered
a serious injury,

39:08.413 --> 39:09.812
and I just want to
make sure that...

39:09.847 --> 39:11.614
Yeah, no, and I battled back,
you know?

39:11.649 --> 39:13.816
And I did it and I'm here.

39:13.851 --> 39:16.886
And sometimes the body
heals faster than the mind.

39:16.921 --> 39:20.456
Have you had any anxiety
about coming back to work?

39:20.491 --> 39:22.658
No, because I'm ready.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.694
And there's really only one way
to find out for sure.

39:24.729 --> 39:28.097
That's not really
how we do things here.

39:28.132 --> 39:29.098
We?

39:29.133 --> 39:30.733
What do you mean by "we"?

39:30.768 --> 39:33.636
Now it's your decision
to make?

39:33.671 --> 39:34.738
Yes.

39:37.775 --> 39:40.843
All right.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.912
What do I need to do
to prove it to you?

39:42.947 --> 39:45.047
Just talk to me.

39:45.082 --> 39:46.682
What do you want to know?

39:46.717 --> 39:48.985
How are you really doing?

39:49.020 --> 39:51.788
You know, with everything
that happened to you?

39:51.823 --> 39:53.923
I'm grateful.
I lived.

39:53.958 --> 39:56.793
I could've died and I got
a second chance at life.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.561
You did.

39:59.697 --> 40:01.898
Not to say that
I'm not frustrated sometimes

40:01.933 --> 40:03.733
and even maybe, like,
a little bit depressed,

40:03.768 --> 40:06.035
but, I mean, who wouldn't be
after a situation like that?

40:06.070 --> 40:07.603
I mean, I've done everything
that my physical therapist

40:07.638 --> 40:08.871
told me to do,
and will I be back

40:08.906 --> 40:10.840
to being as good
as I was before? I have no idea.

40:12.877 --> 40:14.911
And you're okay with that?

40:14.946 --> 40:16.746
Well, I will be 100%.

40:16.781 --> 40:19.615
I will be, at some point.

40:19.650 --> 40:20.984
And what if you're not?

40:24.822 --> 40:26.489
That's not really an option.

40:26.524 --> 40:28.858
Any doubts you might have
about your physical ability

40:28.893 --> 40:31.861
can affect your decision making.
I never said
I was having any doubts.

40:33.030 --> 40:35.998
Nate, you can't take this
away from me, you can't.

40:36.033 --> 40:39.168
I just want what's best
for you and the team.

40:39.203 --> 40:41.070
And, unfortunately,

40:41.105 --> 40:42.872
they may not be the same thing.

40:42.907 --> 40:45.575
Listen to me, I belong here.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.612
Not yet.

40:54.552 --> 40:58.120
IRVIN:
If you hadn't been there, Sam...

40:58.155 --> 41:00.590
SAM: Nah, you would've
still put that gun down.

41:00.625 --> 41:01.757
IRVIN:
I don't know.

41:01.792 --> 41:03.192
You know all that good
we've done here

41:03.227 --> 41:04.827
would've been torn up.

41:04.862 --> 41:06.863
Yeah, you would've never
let that happen.

41:06.898 --> 41:08.831
Great working with you, Sam.

41:08.866 --> 41:12.235
Hey, you ever think about
a career change, for real,

41:12.270 --> 41:14.937
always got room for you.

41:14.972 --> 41:15.972
Thanks, Byron.

41:19.076 --> 41:20.076
Sancho,

41:20.111 --> 41:22.745
we good?

41:22.780 --> 41:24.680
My gut told me not to trust you,

41:24.715 --> 41:26.616
that you were a plant,
and you were.

41:26.651 --> 41:30.520
We got a youth basketball
tournament next weekend.

41:30.555 --> 41:31.888
Could use another ref.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.291
I'll be there.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.693
We'll see.
(Sam chuckles)

41:37.728 --> 41:39.295
Thanks, Irvin.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.863
Thank you.

41:40.898 --> 41:42.899
(Sam laughs)

41:47.305 --> 41:49.506
Hey, hey.
(laughs)

41:56.013 --> 41:57.547
CALLEN:
Put a plate aside for you

41:57.582 --> 41:58.848
before these guys
ate it all.

41:58.883 --> 42:00.082
Hey.
Hey.
(laughs)

42:00.117 --> 42:01.918
We'd be doing
this food a disservice

42:01.953 --> 42:03.319
if we didn't
try it all, right?

42:03.354 --> 42:04.554
You good?

42:04.589 --> 42:05.888
Yeah.

42:05.923 --> 42:07.323
DEEKS: You should definitely
try the jerk chicken,

42:07.358 --> 42:08.658
it's not hot at all.

42:08.693 --> 42:10.059
(laughter)

42:10.094 --> 42:12.762
Mmm.

42:12.797 --> 42:13.930
That's amazing.

42:13.965 --> 42:15.231
Is that Ackee Bamboo?

42:15.266 --> 42:17.033
For my money,

42:17.068 --> 42:18.601
best Jamaican food
in the city.

42:18.636 --> 42:20.570
It's actually my money
'cause I paid for it.

42:20.605 --> 42:22.004
Enjoy.

42:22.039 --> 42:22.938
DEEKS:
Can I have that plantain?

42:22.974 --> 42:25.141
SAM: Yeah.
DEEKS: Really? It's gluten-free?

42:25.176 --> 42:26.709
(Anna laughs)

42:26.744 --> 42:27.877
DEEKS:<i> Cheers. </i>
NELL:<i> Cheers!</i>

42:27.912 --> 42:29.212
(laughter)

42:29.247 --> 42:30.613
DEEKS:<i> So I heard you guys were</i>
<i> going on a date to LEGOLAND.</i>
