13:00.989 --> 13:03.241
Why do you keep torturing yourself?

13:03.324 --> 13:05.618
And why did you draw that slate
in the first place?

13:05.702 --> 13:09.205
I need to remember what happened
last time so I don't mess up again.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.541
Now, which call do you think
is my strongest?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.584
[barks like seal]

13:13.668 --> 13:14.794
Or...

13:14.877 --> 13:16.379
[ribbits]

13:16.462 --> 13:17.672
Or...

13:17.755 --> 13:21.300
[vibrates lips, shrieks]

13:21.384 --> 13:22.468
Come again?

13:22.552 --> 13:26.556
Couldn't hear you over the sound of that
bear owl, mosquitoad and gir-elephant.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.727
-Eep, they are all winners!
-No, they all need work.

13:30.810 --> 13:34.147
I have to make sure every aspect
of my performance is perfect

13:34.230 --> 13:36.816
so I don't repeat... "The Failure."

13:36.899 --> 13:40.069
Or you could just have fun with it,
you know?

13:40.153 --> 13:43.281
Thunk, do you know how many of my heroes
won the Beasty Pageant

13:43.364 --> 13:44.490
when they were kids?

13:44.574 --> 13:48.286
Amber, Wal, that guy who can balance
all those rocks on his head.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.246
That pageant changed my life!

13:50.329 --> 13:52.415
And they sure didn't do it by having fun!

13:52.498 --> 13:56.836
Darn straight, I didn't!
Over here, you bozos!

13:56.919 --> 14:01.466
-Gran, you won the Beasty Pageant?
-I don't know.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.426
Let's ask some liyotes!

14:03.509 --> 14:05.678
[howls]

14:05.762 --> 14:08.139
[all howling]

14:10.099 --> 14:12.894
Oh, wow! Gran, can you train me?

14:12.977 --> 14:17.356
Oh, I don't know.
Let's ask some wart frogs.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.651
[ribbits, snorts]

14:20.735 --> 14:24.197
-[loud snorting]
-[Eep gasps, laughs]

14:24.697 --> 14:26.199
The key to this pageant

14:26.282 --> 14:30.912
is be exactly the way I am every day.
Perfect.

14:30.995 --> 14:35.083
Round one, poses. Crabby tabby, go!

14:35.792 --> 14:37.627
[meows]

14:37.710 --> 14:41.089
[gasps] Ooh! Crab-tabulous!

14:41.172 --> 14:42.965
That's crab-tabverage at best.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.927
Tail should be straighter.
Your claws rounder.

14:46.010 --> 14:49.555
Your tongue scratchier!
Your legs more numerous!

14:49.639 --> 14:51.474
-[screeches]
-[screams]

14:51.557 --> 14:53.810
And you call that bleeding?

14:54.227 --> 14:58.147
Round two, calls. Repeat after me.

14:58.231 --> 15:02.693
[meows, hisses]

15:02.777 --> 15:06.197
[repeats noises]

15:06.280 --> 15:08.366
No. Do it again.

15:08.449 --> 15:11.077
Aw! [repeats noises]

15:19.001 --> 15:20.753
That's it! You're ready.

15:20.837 --> 15:24.799
-You really think so?
-Nope. But it's time for the pageant.

15:26.801 --> 15:31.514

[all cheer]

15:55.371 --> 15:58.207
[purrs]

15:58.291 --> 16:02.086
I'm feeling pretty good about my chances.
Mastered a few new impressions.

16:02.170 --> 16:05.214
One of them was
of the fiercest predator of-- Eep?

16:05.298 --> 16:07.633
Yep. I'm back and I'm here to win.

16:07.717 --> 16:13.055
Sweet! But I'm also here to win,
so... what?

16:13.139 --> 16:14.891
I did not plan for this.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.185
Uh, any last advice?

16:17.268 --> 16:21.898
Do everything perfectly and live in fear
of even the slightest mistake.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.067
[emcee] Round one, animal poses.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.487
First up, the lizvult.

16:34.243 --> 16:38.956
Is that perfect? Is it?
Would my voice be in your head if it was?

16:39.624 --> 16:42.126
Whoa! Awesome lizvult, Eep!

16:42.210 --> 16:45.463
Can't say I'm surprised,
since everything you do is awes...

16:45.546 --> 16:46.756
You out!

16:46.839 --> 16:49.383
At least now I don't have
to root against myself.

16:49.467 --> 16:54.388
-Go, Eep!
-Next up, the Moooose.

17:00.561 --> 17:01.896
You so out!

17:01.979 --> 17:04.773
They are dropping like flying bugs, folks!

17:04.857 --> 17:06.733
Amber see enough.

17:06.817 --> 17:11.196
Kevin best.
Eep, Mosh, Sulk, also pretty good.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.324
Move on to round two.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.954
Way to go, Eep! Pretty good!
That's really close to "good,"

17:18.037 --> 17:21.874
-and not all that far from "great!"
-No, Thunk, if I'm not the best...

17:21.958 --> 17:24.252
-I might as well be worst.
-You might as well be worst.

17:24.335 --> 17:28.005
Well, at least you're good
at knowing how terrible you are.

17:28.089 --> 17:32.051
And now, the round that at least one
of you has been waiting for,

17:32.134 --> 17:33.511
animal calls.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.055
Whoo! [laughs]

17:39.433 --> 17:41.686

17:43.688 --> 17:45.314
Lion-squirrel!

17:45.398 --> 17:48.818

17:51.529 --> 17:52.530
Fishcat.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.783
[coughs]

17:55.866 --> 17:57.451
Moler bear.

17:59.287 --> 18:04.041
Remember, snarl, snarl, hiss, roar, snarl!

18:04.125 --> 18:06.210
Also, you're terrible.

18:06.294 --> 18:07.587
[sighs]

18:08.754 --> 18:11.132
[roars, snarls]

18:13.843 --> 18:15.469
[all cheer]

18:16.637 --> 18:19.390
Amber want give helpful criticism.

18:19.473 --> 18:24.562
But that hard, so instead,
Amber say whatever come into Amber head.

18:24.645 --> 18:29.317
Mosh yip, stirring. Sulk roar, revelation.

18:29.400 --> 18:33.029
Kevin bubble, make Amber hate everything!

18:33.112 --> 18:35.323
-And Eep, growl so-so.
-Huh?

18:35.406 --> 18:37.992
-You and Kevin out!
-What?

18:38.075 --> 18:39.702
Mosh and Sulk go to finals.

18:39.785 --> 18:40.911
[all cheer]

18:40.995 --> 18:43.873
But I did mine exactly right!

18:43.956 --> 18:47.293
Eep growl technically flawless,
but have no heart.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.253
Now, Eep be good loser.

18:49.337 --> 18:53.299
Tell Mosh and Sulk,
Eep glad they so much better than Eep.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.800
[groans]

18:56.969 --> 18:58.638
[muffled yips]

18:58.721 --> 19:02.141
Okay, Mosh, we all know you did
a good yip, no need to rub it in.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.979
Mosh faked her yip! She's a yip-syncer!

19:07.063 --> 19:10.900
You, out! Eep, in.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.736
[gasps, whimpers]

19:14.362 --> 19:18.032
Amber said I need more heart.
I don't get it!

19:18.115 --> 19:20.534
To be honest, you didn't look like
you were having fun.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.787
Animals always look like
they're having fun.

19:25.748 --> 19:29.293
Exactly!
You need to look like you're having fun.

19:29.377 --> 19:32.880
Smile. Bigger. Bigger!

19:32.963 --> 19:37.051
Huh. Not too big,
you don't wanna look like a freak.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.512
There, now you're having fun!

19:39.595 --> 19:43.015
-Just in time for the final round.
-[emcee] The strut!

19:43.099 --> 19:47.353

Now, please welcome

19:55.778 --> 19:59.031
Tweet! Tweet! Also, chirp!

19:59.115 --> 20:02.368
Whoa, he's good! I have to be better!

20:02.451 --> 20:05.204
Maybe I can widen my eyes even more!

20:05.287 --> 20:06.163
Uh...

20:06.247 --> 20:10.042
Your mouth is smiling,
but your eyes are... dying?

20:10.126 --> 20:14.630
Is this better? Or how about this?
Tell me, tell me! They gotta be flawless!

20:14.714 --> 20:16.257
[groans]

20:16.340 --> 20:17.842
[strains]

20:18.718 --> 20:20.761
[emcee] Now, that's commitment, folks!

20:20.845 --> 20:24.098
Boy, I would not want to follow that.
[laughs]

20:24.181 --> 20:27.143
Now, someone who has to, Eep!

20:28.853 --> 20:29.979
[Gran groans]

20:30.062 --> 20:33.399
She's gotta pose harder.
Punch it! Punch it!

20:39.280 --> 20:41.449
[grunts, shouts]

20:41.532 --> 20:43.909
[emcee] Oh, you hate to see this!

20:43.993 --> 20:46.662
Except, secretly, you love it.

20:46.746 --> 20:50.875
She's failing again.
You're failing! Again!

20:52.793 --> 20:54.795
Eep, just have fun!

20:56.630 --> 20:59.091
[Thunk] <i>Just have fun! Fun!</i>

20:59.175 --> 21:01.886

[all cheer]

21:48.599 --> 21:51.852
Amber impressed. Eep show lots of heart.

22:03.948 --> 22:08.202
Amber keep eye on you. Maybe one day
you do great thing, like him.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.995
Just don't steal my bit, man!

22:10.079 --> 22:12.873
I only had confidence in you,

22:12.957 --> 22:15.668
except for the parts of me
that doubted ya.

22:15.751 --> 22:20.339
Ha! Once I stopped worrying about
being perfect, it just clicked!

22:20.422 --> 22:22.591
I should be imperfect more often.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.261
-That's why I'm always imperfect!
-[Lerk] Wait!

22:25.344 --> 22:28.889
Can I at least show off my new impression
of the fiercest predator of all?

22:28.973 --> 22:32.309
Amber! Huh? Huh?

22:32.393 --> 22:33.310
[snaps fingers]

22:33.394 --> 22:37.439
[imitates Amber] I think Lerk is so good
at doing Amber's impression.

Lerk is smartest, most wonderful person.
