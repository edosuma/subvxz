00:13.122 --> 00:16.011
Used to be nothing but woods
above this section of the town.

00:16.012 --> 00:18.847
A year from now, this'll all
be underground parking.

00:18.848 --> 00:20.782
It's a damn shame.
These are some seriously

00:20.783 --> 00:22.184
old-school tunnels.

00:22.185 --> 00:24.619
Looks like a dead end.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.761
There's something back here.

00:33.596 --> 00:34.996
Hand me that.

00:38.134 --> 00:40.735
I got this. (grunts)

00:41.971 --> 00:43.405
Here.

00:44.374 --> 00:46.174
Well, this is just interesting.

00:51.114 --> 00:52.747
(beep)

00:56.653 --> 00:59.087
(footsteps echoing)

01:04.394 --> 01:05.727
Ah.

01:05.728 --> 01:07.596
What do you make of this thing?

01:07.597 --> 01:08.797
Whoa.

01:08.798 --> 01:10.432
We were told to map this section.

01:10.433 --> 01:11.967
Just take a few GPR images.

01:11.968 --> 01:14.136
Don't you want to know
what's down there?

01:14.137 --> 01:16.171
Honestly? No.

01:16.172 --> 01:17.606
(wry laugh)

01:21.110 --> 01:22.978
(beeps)

01:22.979 --> 01:25.780
(grunting with effort)

01:27.083 --> 01:28.403
Give me a hand with this.

01:29.652 --> 01:31.853
(grunts)

01:35.959 --> 01:37.125
(grunts)

01:37.126 --> 01:38.326
Got it.

01:40.863 --> 01:42.331
(grunting with effort)

01:42.332 --> 01:45.200
(hissing)

01:45.201 --> 01:46.902
(man coughing)

01:49.639 --> 01:52.007
Looks like a whole other
tunnel system down there.

01:52.008 --> 01:53.742
(echoing): Yo!

01:55.278 --> 01:57.179
(distant thud)

01:57.180 --> 01:59.347
Hear that?

02:00.717 --> 02:02.651
(growling)

02:02.652 --> 02:04.186
Pete!

02:04.187 --> 02:05.187
Pete!

02:05.188 --> 02:06.688
(growling)

02:07.290 --> 02:09.324
(growling)

02:09.324 --> 02:10.859
(screaming)

02:12.962 --> 02:15.030
(ship's horn blows)

02:15.031 --> 02:17.032
(seabirds calling, buoy bell clanging)

02:17.033 --> 02:18.800
Is it possible, Lieutenant,

02:18.801 --> 02:22.571
that I am fully assimilated in this era?

02:22.572 --> 02:26.241
A man entirely comfortable
in this time, this place?

02:26.242 --> 02:28.010
(girls giggling)

02:28.011 --> 02:29.544
(shutter clicking)

02:29.545 --> 02:31.046
ABBIE: And go.

02:31.047 --> 02:33.181
Instant Gram.

02:33.182 --> 02:35.417
Whatever happened to experiencing life

02:35.418 --> 02:37.653
rather than... posting it?

02:37.654 --> 02:39.554
Says the man with the
photographic memory.

02:39.555 --> 02:43.525
Believe me, there are moments
I would rather forget.

02:43.526 --> 02:47.095
There are reminders
of conflict everywhere.

02:47.096 --> 02:49.097
I know what you mean.

02:49.098 --> 02:51.333
When I was young,
I used to pester Corbin

02:51.334 --> 02:52.734
about his time in combat.

02:52.735 --> 02:54.036
He said...

02:54.037 --> 02:56.505
it was insane and terrible, but...

02:56.506 --> 02:59.908
On the edge of death,
we are never more alive.

02:59.909 --> 03:02.678
Something every man
who fought on this vessel

03:02.679 --> 03:04.513
would know all too well.

03:04.514 --> 03:06.848
Yeah, but that's the point
of places like this...

03:06.849 --> 03:09.251
so no one forgets the sacrifices made

03:09.252 --> 03:11.620
to defend this country and keep us safe.

03:11.621 --> 03:13.588
And...

03:13.589 --> 03:16.692
come on, if the Patriots had
just one ship like this,

03:16.693 --> 03:19.061
they would have beat
the British in two weeks.

03:19.062 --> 03:20.529
(groans) John Paul Jones

03:20.530 --> 03:23.065
would have taken New
York in a single day.

03:23.066 --> 03:24.799
(laughs)

03:27.870 --> 03:30.405
With everything that's happened,

03:30.406 --> 03:31.807
I can't help but feel

03:31.808 --> 03:33.775
like we're fighting evil
without an endgame.

03:33.776 --> 03:37.713
It was almost easier when
we knew who the enemy was.

03:37.714 --> 03:40.215
The Bible foretold seven years

03:40.216 --> 03:42.384
of tribulation, but it did not say

03:42.385 --> 03:43.819
in what form.

03:43.820 --> 03:45.721
So just have faith.

03:45.722 --> 03:46.955
Have faith.

03:46.956 --> 03:48.857
(phone buzzing)

03:50.159 --> 03:52.995
Text from Reyes...
Missing Persons case.

03:52.996 --> 03:54.436
Field trip's over.

03:55.965 --> 03:58.200
(siren wailing)

04:00.670 --> 04:03.538
(camera clicks)

04:05.575 --> 04:08.243
Three-man survey team...

04:08.244 --> 04:11.013
working for a local engineering firm.

04:11.014 --> 04:13.148
They are mapping the area
underneath this section of town.

04:13.149 --> 04:15.817
All part of a new retail development.

04:15.818 --> 04:19.821
Last known contact...
a little over 24 hours ago.

04:19.822 --> 04:23.325
We have a map of the tunnel
systems back at the archives.

04:23.326 --> 04:25.026
Hold on.

04:25.862 --> 04:27.129
(shutter clicks)

04:27.130 --> 04:28.130
I gotta go play bouncer.

04:28.131 --> 04:29.798
I'll be right back. Hey.

04:29.799 --> 04:31.600
No press inside the line.

04:31.601 --> 04:33.802
I'm gonna have to ask you
to put your camera down, sir.

04:33.803 --> 04:35.771
No ambulances or coroner vehicles.

04:35.772 --> 04:38.373
At least you haven't
found any bodies yet.

04:38.374 --> 04:41.109
Sheriff Reyes will provide
a full briefing in an hour.

04:41.110 --> 04:42.611
You've tried

04:42.612 --> 04:44.852
triangulating their
radios and cell phones.

04:45.682 --> 04:47.549
You got nothing.

04:48.551 --> 04:49.718
I mean, this many people...

04:49.719 --> 04:51.353
command post, staging area...

04:51.354 --> 04:53.522
you're dividing into search teams...

04:53.523 --> 04:56.525
It's the same protocol as when
combat patrols don't check in.

04:56.526 --> 04:58.393
It means you guys have absolutely...

04:58.394 --> 05:01.229
no clue where they are.

05:01.230 --> 05:02.731
I'm Calvin Riggs...
my brother Daniel is one

05:02.732 --> 05:04.566
- of the men you can't find.
- You have my word

05:04.567 --> 05:05.968
we're doing everything possible

05:05.969 --> 05:08.337
to find your brother and those men.

05:08.338 --> 05:10.539
Mm. And there's that look.

05:10.540 --> 05:11.573
- What look?
- Infantry grunts

05:11.574 --> 05:13.642
call it "propaganda face."

05:13.643 --> 05:15.978
It's when their superiors
deny anything is going on

05:15.979 --> 05:18.213
right before a major combat
operation takes place.

05:18.214 --> 05:23.018
Three men don't just go missing
underneath a small town, Lieutenant.

05:24.053 --> 05:25.420
Not in Sleepy Hollow.

05:25.421 --> 05:27.923
One: stop looking at my face.

05:27.924 --> 05:30.692
- Two: what does that mean?
- It means this town

05:30.693 --> 05:34.693
is home to a lot of disappearances
and unexplained deaths.

05:35.498 --> 05:38.178
I grew up here...
I know all the stories.

05:39.369 --> 05:41.436
Wait, you're Calvin
Riggs the journalist.

05:41.437 --> 05:44.039
- You covered Syria and Iraq.
- Now you understand

05:44.040 --> 05:45.941
what I'm doing on this
side of that yellow line.

05:45.942 --> 05:47.909
Okay, yeah. We're still trying

05:47.910 --> 05:49.778
to put the pieces together on this.

05:49.779 --> 05:53.281
As soon as I know more...
you'll be my first call.

05:55.084 --> 05:57.819
You still have that look on your face.

05:58.755 --> 06:01.356
No evidence of a struggle,

06:01.357 --> 06:03.692
no sign of the equipment
they were carrying,

06:03.693 --> 06:05.861
not even a scrap of their clothing.

06:05.862 --> 06:08.096
They're down here somewhere,
and we're the only ones

06:08.097 --> 06:10.131
who know about this section.

06:10.967 --> 06:14.069
(wind whistling)

06:14.070 --> 06:15.270
You feel that?

06:15.271 --> 06:17.306
A breeze.

06:17.307 --> 06:19.141
(wind whistling)

06:19.142 --> 06:20.675
Over there.

06:22.612 --> 06:24.913
(wind whistling)

06:27.150 --> 06:29.985
An alcove.

06:29.986 --> 06:31.787
Previously sealed.

06:31.788 --> 06:33.789
I got to say...

06:33.790 --> 06:36.458
kinda sick of heading
down small, dark spaces.

06:36.459 --> 06:39.294
<i>I</i> was the one buried alive.

06:42.465 --> 06:44.666
Discarded equipment.

06:47.337 --> 06:50.805
Symbols of witchcraft.

06:52.108 --> 06:54.743
Claw marks.

06:54.744 --> 06:56.511
Whatever attacked these men

06:56.512 --> 06:59.514
took them down this trapdoor.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.955
Okay, we're gonna need

07:06.956 --> 07:09.958
some tools to open this thing.

07:12.495 --> 07:13.595
(beeping)

07:13.596 --> 07:14.997
Underground...

07:14.998 --> 07:16.531
radar mapping.

07:16.532 --> 07:18.433
Incredible.

07:18.434 --> 07:21.470
Octagonal dome,
Neo-Palladian main chamber,

07:21.471 --> 07:23.005
designed at least

07:23.006 --> 07:24.906
200 years ago.

07:25.942 --> 07:27.209
There's only one man

07:27.210 --> 07:30.178
who could have designed this.

07:30.179 --> 07:32.514
Thomas Jefferson.

07:32.515 --> 07:34.783
Our third president made...

07:34.784 --> 07:36.852
good use of his free time.

07:36.853 --> 07:38.387
Oh, he was a master architect.

07:38.388 --> 07:39.855
As with the...

07:39.856 --> 07:41.390
Masonic Cell,

07:41.391 --> 07:43.525
this is certainly his handiwork.

07:43.526 --> 07:46.206
Someone dropped their phone.

07:49.332 --> 07:51.499
(growling, man screams on video)

07:54.337 --> 07:56.071
(growling)

07:57.916 --> 08:00.942
I think we found what took those men.

08:26.937 --> 08:30.079
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

08:34.250 --> 08:38.086
(blues music playing)

08:38.370 --> 08:40.104
Jenny Mills.

08:40.105 --> 08:41.371
(chuckles): Frank.

08:41.373 --> 08:43.274
You're out late.

08:43.275 --> 08:44.608
It's good to see you.

08:44.609 --> 08:45.876
You, uh, got a moment?

08:45.877 --> 08:47.077
Sure.

08:50.515 --> 08:53.183
- So what's on your mind?
- A favor.

08:53.184 --> 08:55.185
I need your help retrieving something.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.154
Retrieving...?

08:57.155 --> 08:59.890
From the precinct evidence lockup.

09:00.892 --> 09:02.459
When I was arrested,

09:02.460 --> 09:03.727
the department ran a search and seizure

09:03.728 --> 09:05.229
on all my personal belongings...

09:05.230 --> 09:08.032
family heirlooms, sentimental things,

09:08.033 --> 09:09.399
including my wedding ring.

09:10.702 --> 09:12.870
For years...

09:12.871 --> 09:16.040
I've wanted to reconcile my marriage.

09:16.041 --> 09:18.576
I finally have that chance.

09:18.577 --> 09:21.312
I filled out all the proper paperwork,

09:21.313 --> 09:23.847
but they still won't
release all my things.

09:23.848 --> 09:26.317
Keep delaying with the red tape.

09:26.318 --> 09:27.885
You know all the cops down there.

09:27.886 --> 09:29.153
Call in some favors.

09:29.154 --> 09:30.654
(wry laugh)

09:30.655 --> 09:33.190
I was convicted of a double homicide.

09:33.191 --> 09:36.260
So, by "retrieve," you
mean break in and steal?

09:36.261 --> 09:38.896
I need to hack the
evidence room code lock.

09:38.897 --> 09:40.498
And you think I have
something that could do that.

09:40.499 --> 09:43.133
I know you do.

09:49.374 --> 09:51.208
I can get you a hack for the door,

09:51.209 --> 09:53.210
but you're gonna need
someone to keep an eye out

09:53.211 --> 09:54.745
when you take it from lockup.

09:54.746 --> 09:56.847
- I can't ask you to do that.
- I'm offering.

09:56.848 --> 09:59.250
You did, after all,

09:59.251 --> 10:02.353
die taking on the Horseman of War.

10:02.354 --> 10:05.289
I'd say you've earned some backup.

10:05.290 --> 10:06.624
In and out in five minutes,

10:06.625 --> 10:08.726
you have my word.

10:16.768 --> 10:19.570
CRANE: <i>Yes, time is of the essence,</i>

10:19.571 --> 10:21.539
<i>but we must understand
the threat we face.</i>

10:21.540 --> 10:23.274
<i>Not to mention, the purpose</i>

10:23.275 --> 10:24.708
of a Jefferson-designed
chamber below ground.

10:24.709 --> 10:28.045
Jefferson built the Masonic
Cell to hold demons.

10:28.046 --> 10:31.315
- What do you think he built this
chamber for? - I have an inkling.

10:31.316 --> 10:34.151
During the war, rumors surfaced
of a highly classified project

10:34.152 --> 10:35.786
commissioned by General Washington.

10:35.787 --> 10:39.056
The construction of an
impenetrable chamber

10:39.057 --> 10:43.093
meant to safeguard vital
secrets to the Cause.

10:43.094 --> 10:45.963
So like a colonial-era
National Security Agency.

10:45.964 --> 10:47.398
Jefferson christened this chamber

10:47.399 --> 10:50.634
with a rather florid term:
Fenestella...

10:50.635 --> 10:52.002
an indication of his love

10:52.003 --> 10:55.439
of Italian architecture.

10:55.440 --> 10:58.409
Basically it was a fancy word
for "underground room."

10:58.410 --> 11:00.611
- It's a vault.
- Very Jeffersonian.

11:00.612 --> 11:04.181
Uncommon men prize uncommon words.

11:04.182 --> 11:06.183
Okay, "vital secrets" is a little vague.

11:06.184 --> 11:08.252
What could they be stowing away?

11:08.253 --> 11:12.022
Unfortunately, details of this
chamber remain a mystery to me.

11:12.023 --> 11:13.424
I thought you were BFFs
with those guys...

11:13.425 --> 11:14.692
Washington,

11:14.693 --> 11:16.994
- Franklin, Adams...
- If by...

11:16.995 --> 11:18.996
"BFF" you mean Washington was my mentor

11:18.997 --> 11:21.332
and Franklin was a...

11:21.333 --> 11:24.013
a harsh taskmaster, then, yes, BFFs.

11:25.303 --> 11:27.304
My relationship with Jefferson was...

11:27.305 --> 11:29.373
- more complicated.
- You're telling me

11:29.374 --> 11:30.641
you were on the outs with him?

11:30.642 --> 11:32.476
Not at first, no.

11:32.477 --> 11:34.311
At first, we were very close.

11:34.312 --> 11:37.181
I could use the benefit
of a fresh pair of eyes.

11:37.182 --> 11:39.884
Would you oblige me?

11:39.885 --> 11:41.318
It would be an honor, sir.

11:41.319 --> 11:43.020
<i>He was my mentor and...</i>

11:43.021 --> 11:45.856
<i>an inspiration. And I thought...</i>

11:45.857 --> 11:47.124
a friend.

11:47.125 --> 11:49.727
I believed he saw promise in me,

11:49.728 --> 11:51.195
but apparently not.

11:51.196 --> 11:52.797
What changed that?

11:52.798 --> 11:55.199
To use common vernacular,

11:55.200 --> 11:58.202
Jefferson unfriended me.

11:58.203 --> 12:00.004
It came completely out of the blue.

12:00.005 --> 12:04.342
One moment, he was showing
me the path, every word

12:04.343 --> 12:05.676
inspiring imagination.

12:05.677 --> 12:07.545
The next...

12:07.546 --> 12:08.913
persona non grata.

12:08.914 --> 12:12.049
To this day, it remains a mystery to me.

12:12.050 --> 12:13.884
As does the Fenestella.

12:13.885 --> 12:16.887
Fenestella... I know I've
read that word before.

12:16.888 --> 12:19.190
In Grace Dixon's...

12:19.191 --> 12:21.225
journal...

12:21.226 --> 12:23.060
Here.

12:23.061 --> 12:25.396
Notes on a meeting between
Washington and Jefferson,

12:25.397 --> 12:28.199
January, 1777.

12:28.200 --> 12:32.703
"...dark, damned souls will be
used to protect the Fenestella."

12:32.704 --> 12:35.673
So basically Jefferson and your
buddies conjured something nasty

12:35.674 --> 12:37.775
- to guard the chamber.
- Does Miss Dixon's journal

12:37.776 --> 12:41.045
say anything else about
these damned souls?

12:41.046 --> 12:42.613
It's pretty scarce on details.

12:42.614 --> 12:44.748
But we're gonna find out more.

12:45.584 --> 12:47.952
Agreed.

12:47.953 --> 12:50.073
A reconnaissance mission is required.

13:00.766 --> 13:04.768
(creaking)

13:07.439 --> 13:08.639
(creaking)

13:08.640 --> 13:10.808
(sighs)

13:13.979 --> 13:17.148
(creaking)

13:26.558 --> 13:27.558
CRANE: Lieutenant.

13:27.559 --> 13:29.260
I see it.

13:33.432 --> 13:34.932
C-Q.

13:34.933 --> 13:37.435
C-Q, comm check.

13:37.436 --> 13:39.670
Comm check. Engineering team,
this is Lieutenant Mills

13:39.671 --> 13:42.006
with the Sleepy Hollow Sheriff's
Department. Do you copy?

13:42.007 --> 13:46.844
Engineering team. Daniel Riggs.
We copy. Mayday.

13:46.845 --> 13:48.446
Trapped underground. Please help.

13:48.447 --> 13:50.281
(growling in distance)

13:50.282 --> 13:52.083
We need your location.

13:52.084 --> 13:53.317
Where are you? Do you copy?

13:53.318 --> 13:54.919
Oh, God. No, they're moving.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.321
- They can hear you.
- (distant growling continues)

14:01.526 --> 14:03.861
The image we saw depicted one creature.

14:03.862 --> 14:06.364
Sounds like a lot more than one.

14:06.365 --> 14:08.065
(growling continues)

14:12.371 --> 14:13.804
Might I suggest a change of tactic?

14:13.805 --> 14:16.207
(snarling)

14:16.208 --> 14:20.077
We definitely need more firepower.

14:23.849 --> 14:25.483
Crane!

14:25.484 --> 14:26.484
(snarling)

14:26.485 --> 14:27.885
(grunting)

14:27.886 --> 14:29.386
(shouts)

14:30.389 --> 14:32.857
(hissing, snarling)

14:33.559 --> 14:35.426
(grunts) Stay back!

14:48.373 --> 14:51.609
You were about to call me... right?

14:54.467 --> 14:56.786
I need you two to stop walking
that fast and talk to me.

14:56.787 --> 14:58.787
- Lieutenant...
- He's a journalist.

14:58.788 --> 15:00.789
His brother's one of
the men lost down here.

15:00.790 --> 15:02.550
CALVIN: Just stop!

15:03.426 --> 15:05.861
You two just crawled out
of an underground trapdoor

15:05.862 --> 15:08.597
looking like you finished a cage match.

15:08.598 --> 15:11.867
- Meaning...?
- That I heard animal noises down there.

15:11.868 --> 15:13.635
I think you guys know exactly

15:13.636 --> 15:16.472
what's going on and are
hell-bent on hiding it.

15:16.473 --> 15:17.740
- Mr. Riggs...
- Calvin.

15:17.741 --> 15:19.942
Calvin, I appreciate you trying to help,

15:19.943 --> 15:22.211
but you cannot be down here right now...
what are you doing?

15:22.212 --> 15:23.712
Calling my editor in New York.

15:23.713 --> 15:25.781
Then my contacts in the military.

15:25.782 --> 15:27.750
When you win a Pulitzer,
people take your calls.

15:27.751 --> 15:28.917
Mr. Riggs...

15:28.918 --> 15:31.019
My brother is down there.

15:32.656 --> 15:36.225
You must understand there are
consequences to your actions.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.826
Where's the fire department?

15:38.561 --> 15:39.662
Hmm?

15:39.663 --> 15:41.263
The SWAT team?

15:41.264 --> 15:43.165
Why's it just you two
crawling around down here?

15:43.166 --> 15:44.566
Because we don't know enough

15:44.567 --> 15:46.068
- about the situation yet.
- Well, then

15:46.069 --> 15:48.137
- tell me what you do know.
- CRANE: I am...

15:48.138 --> 15:49.972
sympathetic to your plight,

15:49.973 --> 15:54.510
but your journalistic imperative
cannot supersede public welfare.

15:54.511 --> 15:57.780
Iran, China, North Korea...

15:57.781 --> 15:59.181
countries who've given me that line.

15:59.182 --> 16:01.083
This isn't a war.

16:01.084 --> 16:04.286
It's about my four-year-old
niece losing her father.

16:05.322 --> 16:06.822
Calvin, trust us.

16:06.823 --> 16:08.524
It's our job; it's what we do.

16:08.525 --> 16:09.959
I need more than that.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.094
You want us to get your brother?

16:12.095 --> 16:14.763
I heard his voice over the radio.

16:14.764 --> 16:16.799
- Daniel.
- He's alive.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.701
It means that there's a
chance that we can save him,

16:18.702 --> 16:22.638
but the last thing we need is a
media circus getting in our way.

16:22.639 --> 16:24.873
Limited access to our investigation.

16:25.642 --> 16:28.577
Lieutenant... a moment?

16:31.715 --> 16:33.515
I know letting him in is a risk, but...

16:33.516 --> 16:35.317
it's something that the
military does all the time...

16:35.318 --> 16:37.319
they embed journalists so that
they can control the story.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.688
We have no idea if
we can trust this man.

16:39.689 --> 16:41.991
My gut tells me that we can. I
don't know why, but it does.

16:41.992 --> 16:44.627
And by the way, you guys are
the ones who put freedom

16:44.628 --> 16:46.128
of the press in the Constitution.

16:46.129 --> 16:49.365
Well, we did not predict
the 24-hour news cycle.

16:49.366 --> 16:51.066
- Wait here.
- You said access.

16:51.067 --> 16:52.601
I said "limited."

17:01.044 --> 17:02.277
Ten minutes.

17:07.483 --> 17:11.686
The markings translate from
the Latin as "Reavers."

17:11.688 --> 17:13.656
That must refer to the creatures we saw.

17:13.656 --> 17:16.058
Reavers were not creatures in my era.

17:17.527 --> 17:20.561
They were Washington's secret forces.

17:20.563 --> 17:22.830
They must have been assigned
to guard the Fenestella.

17:22.832 --> 17:24.566
Those things didn't seem human.

17:24.567 --> 17:26.201
More like feral.

17:26.202 --> 17:29.838
And how could anyone live that long?

17:29.839 --> 17:31.407
Something about them must have changed.

17:31.408 --> 17:32.942
If a detachment of Reavers

17:32.943 --> 17:35.044
were deployed to guard the Fenestella

17:35.045 --> 17:36.278
for an indefinite period,

17:36.279 --> 17:38.347
perhaps their physiology

17:38.348 --> 17:40.382
has been supernaturally altered.

17:40.383 --> 17:42.685
So Reavers are just amped-up sentries?

17:42.686 --> 17:44.620
Left for hundreds of years in the dark.

17:44.621 --> 17:46.922
Unguarded, untended...

17:46.923 --> 17:49.758
alive, but in hibernation.

17:49.759 --> 17:52.428
Let's say the survey
team came across them.

17:52.429 --> 17:54.230
The Reavers woke up
and took them prisoner.

17:54.231 --> 17:55.864
Or worse.

17:55.865 --> 17:58.300
(snarling)

17:58.301 --> 18:00.221
CRANE: <i>They'd be starving.</i>

18:05.642 --> 18:08.377
Okay, here's how it works:

18:08.378 --> 18:10.312
You do everything that we say,

18:10.313 --> 18:12.214
no arguments, no questions.

18:12.215 --> 18:13.515
No questions?

18:14.784 --> 18:16.485
You do know what I do
for a living, right?

18:16.486 --> 18:18.287
Lieutenant, this was a mistake.

18:18.288 --> 18:20.222
You're not helping your cause.

18:20.223 --> 18:21.323
Playing ball goes both ways.

18:21.324 --> 18:22.825
Can we trust you?

18:23.760 --> 18:25.895
I just want to find my brother.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.297
- So that's a yes?
- Agreed.

18:48.351 --> 18:49.652
(beeps softly)

18:49.653 --> 18:51.987
Well, make it fast.

18:51.988 --> 18:54.323
Five minutes.

19:23.286 --> 19:25.020
(gun clicks)

19:25.021 --> 19:26.622
Thought you'd give me more
credit than this, Frank.

19:26.623 --> 19:29.458
I just had to know what you were doing.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.227
It's not what it looks like.

19:31.228 --> 19:32.528
The Hellfire Club?

19:32.529 --> 19:35.698
Crazy cult that tried to raise Moloch.

19:35.699 --> 19:37.466
That worked for Henry Parish.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.901
I can explain.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.238
Frank!

19:46.243 --> 19:47.810
ABBIE: You stay here.

19:47.811 --> 19:49.378
Why?

19:49.379 --> 19:52.248
If this goes sideways and
we don't make it out,

19:52.249 --> 19:54.850
thinking that SWAT team
option sounds pretty good.

19:54.851 --> 19:56.719
I got your back.

19:58.755 --> 20:00.189
May I?

20:00.190 --> 20:02.358
What...?

20:02.359 --> 20:04.093
Hey.

20:04.094 --> 20:05.494
What are you doing to my flash?

20:05.495 --> 20:07.329
Stay back, please.

20:07.330 --> 20:08.831
What are you doing, Crane?

20:08.832 --> 20:10.699
Based on the Reavers'
response to this device

20:10.700 --> 20:12.835
when last we surfaced,

20:12.836 --> 20:14.770
this trick ought to work.

20:14.771 --> 20:16.672
Stoneroot bark powder.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.607
It was used to amplify

20:18.608 --> 20:22.111
signal fires during night battles.

20:22.112 --> 20:23.179
That's a $7,000 camera.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.680
Tut, tut.

20:24.681 --> 20:26.415
Thank you.

20:26.416 --> 20:27.783
Ah!

20:34.758 --> 20:37.726
(electrical buzzing)

20:52.943 --> 20:55.511
(distant growling)

20:58.048 --> 21:00.149
This must be the entrance
to the Fenestella.

21:04.154 --> 21:07.423
(Reavers growling, snarling)

21:16.299 --> 21:18.434
Crane, the door!

21:26.810 --> 21:28.644
It cannot be.

21:28.645 --> 21:30.646
Crane...

21:30.647 --> 21:32.982
is that you?

21:34.317 --> 21:36.151
Jefferson.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.482
Mr. Jefferson.

21:41.483 --> 21:42.950
Actually it's Mr. President.

21:44.119 --> 21:45.486
It's good to see you, too, Crane.

21:45.487 --> 21:49.256
Uh... pardon me, sir...

21:49.257 --> 21:51.058
how is your presence here possible?

21:51.059 --> 21:52.226
He died in 1826.

21:52.227 --> 21:53.650
Well, it seems we've both

21:53.651 --> 21:55.151
outlived our expectations.

21:55.152 --> 21:56.686
And Adams.

21:58.489 --> 22:00.857
My spirit endures
thanks to a combination

22:00.858 --> 22:03.193
of science and witchcraft.

22:03.194 --> 22:05.295
<i>I knew that my Fenestella needed</i>

22:05.296 --> 22:07.864
<i>an endless source of power,
so I designed a cube</i>

22:07.865 --> 22:11.701
<i>which could harness supernatural energy.</i>

22:11.702 --> 22:15.171
<i>Our allies from the Order of
the Sacred Heart did the rest.</i>

22:19.777 --> 22:22.545
Franklin choked with
envy when he saw it.

22:25.616 --> 22:29.352
- Remarkable.
- ABBIE: So we're talking to a hologram of

22:29.353 --> 22:32.388
third president, writer of the
Declaration of Independence.

22:32.389 --> 22:34.491
Architect of Monticello.

22:34.492 --> 22:36.526
- Must you?
- Apologies.

22:36.527 --> 22:39.963
So... you are Thomas Jefferson's proxy.

22:39.964 --> 22:41.397
But with the same memories,

22:41.398 --> 22:44.334
feelings and personality of the man.

22:44.335 --> 22:48.338
Think of me as a deeply kindred spirit.

22:48.339 --> 22:50.473
Mr. President, three men were taken by

22:50.474 --> 22:52.475
those creatures out there.
We're here to rescue them.

22:52.476 --> 22:54.144
May I present my associate,

22:54.145 --> 22:56.312
Lieutenant Abigail Mills.

22:56.313 --> 22:57.747
The honor is mine.

22:57.748 --> 23:00.016
Now, come, both of you.
There's much to see.

23:00.017 --> 23:02.051
I am afraid our visit

23:02.052 --> 23:04.154
is of rather an urgent nature.

23:04.155 --> 23:05.522
Any assistance

23:05.523 --> 23:07.056
you can provide in the safe return

23:07.057 --> 23:10.727
of those victims would be most welcome.

23:10.728 --> 23:13.329
If I could help, I gladly would.

23:13.330 --> 23:14.430
But there's far too much at stake.

23:14.431 --> 23:16.399
All due respect, sir,

23:16.400 --> 23:17.500
we know the men are still alive.

23:17.501 --> 23:18.668
Reavers have taken them,

23:18.669 --> 23:19.769
we just need to know where.

23:19.770 --> 23:22.005
What year is this?

23:22.006 --> 23:24.340
Two thousand and fifteen.

23:24.341 --> 23:25.742
Ah, better late than never.

23:25.743 --> 23:28.011
I had hoped that, by your presence here,

23:28.012 --> 23:30.280
you had come for the information
inside the Fenestella.

23:30.281 --> 23:33.883
I fear you underestimate the
importance of our mission.

23:33.884 --> 23:36.986
Your mission is the very
reason I'm here, Crane.

23:40.257 --> 23:43.110
Frank!

23:44.962 --> 23:46.963
(grunting)

23:46.964 --> 23:48.264
Jenny!

23:50.968 --> 23:53.603
I need you to listen!

23:53.604 --> 23:55.205
The markings on your arms.

23:55.206 --> 23:58.475
An obviously bogus mission.

23:58.476 --> 24:00.376
You've gone to the dark
side, haven't you?

24:00.377 --> 24:03.179
My soul is tarnished.

24:04.248 --> 24:05.615
It has been...

24:05.616 --> 24:07.984
since the moment I was reborn.

24:11.222 --> 24:12.722
<i>That other version of me...</i>

24:12.723 --> 24:15.792
<i>the Frank Irving filled with evil...</i>

24:15.793 --> 24:18.728
is like another person inside of me.

24:18.729 --> 24:21.898
When he takes over,

24:21.899 --> 24:24.567
I only get fragments.

24:24.568 --> 24:26.936
You don't remember anything
after you came back?

24:26.937 --> 24:28.805
From what I can piece together,

24:28.806 --> 24:31.474
Cynthia wanted to know
if my soul was clean.

24:31.475 --> 24:32.976
Yes.

24:32.977 --> 24:34.978
She asked Katrina to do it.

24:34.979 --> 24:36.446
And you passed.

24:36.447 --> 24:38.181
Because of this.

24:39.650 --> 24:41.451
What the hell is that?

24:41.452 --> 24:42.852
Temporary Salvation.

24:42.853 --> 24:44.420
<i>Before I died,</i>

24:44.421 --> 24:46.456
<i>I learned of an ancient rune</i>

24:46.457 --> 24:48.697
<i>hidden in a book kept by Henry Parish...</i>

24:53.364 --> 24:56.466
<i>...one that could shield the
true nature of a cursed soul.</i>

25:00.204 --> 25:03.239
<i>I needed to buy myself some time.</i>

25:09.046 --> 25:10.880
(screams)

25:11.682 --> 25:13.750
(screaming)

25:15.719 --> 25:17.420
(screaming)

25:18.856 --> 25:22.025
<i>It worked like a charm, but...</i>

25:22.026 --> 25:25.128
<i>it had an unintended side effect.</i>

25:25.129 --> 25:26.963
It made me feel human again.

25:26.964 --> 25:30.700
It gave me absolute clarity.

25:30.701 --> 25:33.636
And I knew what I needed to do.

25:33.637 --> 25:35.738
What are we really doing here, Frank?

25:35.739 --> 25:37.040
I found a ledger

25:37.041 --> 25:39.642
<i>in Henry Parish's desk...</i>

25:39.643 --> 25:42.212
<i>names, numbers...</i>

25:42.213 --> 25:44.814
all relating back to the Hellfire Club.

25:44.815 --> 25:46.883
<i>Proof of wire transfers</i>

25:46.884 --> 25:50.853
<i>totaling $1.37 million.</i>

25:52.056 --> 25:53.923
For Cynthia.

25:53.924 --> 25:55.258
Account numbers for offshore banks

25:55.259 --> 25:57.227
so she and Macey can get as far away

25:57.228 --> 25:59.062
from Sleepy Hollow as possible.

25:59.063 --> 26:02.565
This is evidence, Frank.

26:02.566 --> 26:04.934
Even if the cops haven't
figured out what's on it.

26:04.935 --> 26:06.936
This is reparations.

26:08.205 --> 26:10.673
I lost my job.

26:10.674 --> 26:12.342
I lost my soul.

26:12.343 --> 26:14.110
I lost my family.

26:15.679 --> 26:17.914
This is security for them.

26:17.915 --> 26:20.183
Why bring me in on all of this?

26:20.184 --> 26:23.453
Because my time is running out, Jenny.

26:23.454 --> 26:27.457
The power of the rune is fading.

26:28.559 --> 26:30.894
That other Frank...

26:30.895 --> 26:32.729
is about to take over

26:32.730 --> 26:34.997
and replace me, forever.

26:35.866 --> 26:38.701
It is why I came to you.

26:38.702 --> 26:40.703
You are the only one

26:40.704 --> 26:43.439
who understands...

26:43.440 --> 26:46.109
my family needs protection.

26:47.444 --> 26:50.146
I'm not gonna get this chance again.

26:50.147 --> 26:52.415
Thank you for doing this.

27:01.258 --> 27:03.159
(whispering): How does
Jefferson know of our mission?

27:03.160 --> 27:05.628
I have no idea, but right now
I'm more concerned with

27:05.629 --> 27:08.631
finding Calvin's brother
and those men alive.

27:08.632 --> 27:10.967
You said you two were friends.

27:10.968 --> 27:12.268
Get him to help us.

27:12.269 --> 27:13.603
He's a witchcraft-generated spirit

27:13.604 --> 27:15.271
of a man who died two centuries ago.

27:15.272 --> 27:16.940
Yeah. There are three men are out there.

27:16.941 --> 27:18.641
Make it work.

27:20.845 --> 27:23.346
Sir, if you do indeed

27:23.347 --> 27:24.981
represent the man I once knew,

27:24.982 --> 27:27.250
then you must be able
to assist us in our task.

27:27.251 --> 27:28.751
Well, don't you see, Crane?

27:28.752 --> 27:30.253
The very purpose of the Fenestella

27:30.254 --> 27:31.988
is to assist you.

28:04.021 --> 28:06.222
♪ ♪

28:18.169 --> 28:20.603
(snoring)

28:25.242 --> 28:27.443
(raspy breathing)

28:43.394 --> 28:45.528
One of a kind.

28:45.529 --> 28:48.164
A book on eschatology

28:48.165 --> 28:49.999
written during the Roman Empire.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.369
The study of the End of Days.

28:54.371 --> 28:57.273
You know we are Witnesses.

28:57.274 --> 28:59.576
The Reavers' nest is right underneath us.

28:59.577 --> 29:01.110
Two workers are still alive.

29:01.111 --> 29:03.112
Never trust a politician.

29:03.113 --> 29:04.914
I never said they were dead.
The power source

29:04.915 --> 29:07.250
that fuels this chamber is fragile.

29:07.251 --> 29:10.753
Attacking the nest will destroy
the entire Fenestella.

29:10.754 --> 29:12.255
A risk we'll have to take.

29:12.256 --> 29:15.625
It weighs on me...

29:15.626 --> 29:18.594
that these men must die.

29:19.897 --> 29:21.464
But the information

29:21.465 --> 29:23.133
within these walls eclipses

29:23.134 --> 29:24.934
the needs of the few...

29:24.935 --> 29:27.137
as tragic as that may be.

29:27.138 --> 29:30.106
Have you not asked yourselves why?

29:30.107 --> 29:32.142
Why you were chosen?

29:32.143 --> 29:37.547
The nature of your mission?

29:37.548 --> 29:39.849
Is in this chamber.

29:43.943 --> 29:46.912
If this place holds all the answers

29:46.913 --> 29:48.180
to every question we have

29:48.181 --> 29:49.514
about our role as Witnesses,

29:49.515 --> 29:51.249
why would you keep it from me?

29:51.250 --> 29:52.918
The prophecy was quite clear:

29:52.919 --> 29:57.255
no interference until the
Second Witness appeared.

29:57.256 --> 29:58.590
So now that I'm here...?

29:58.591 --> 30:01.793
Your mission may begin in earnest.

30:03.863 --> 30:07.265
The Folio Immaculata.

30:07.266 --> 30:09.434
Among the knowledge within it,

30:09.435 --> 30:13.872
certain volumes identify
potential mentors

30:13.873 --> 30:15.907
to guide you in your missions.

30:17.376 --> 30:19.044
Like Corbin.

30:19.045 --> 30:21.079
Age is the price of wisdom.

30:22.014 --> 30:25.984
No... No. Oh, God!

30:25.985 --> 30:27.352
Officer down!

30:27.353 --> 30:29.621
And General Washington.

30:29.622 --> 30:32.791
WASHINGTON: <i> Everyone we needed
to guide us in this war</i>

30:32.792 --> 30:35.026
<i>has been lost to us.</i>

30:36.963 --> 30:40.232
If only you knew how I
wanted to be among them.

30:40.233 --> 30:43.768
But you needed to be
kept at arm's length.

30:46.406 --> 30:49.641
I would advocate expanding and moving

30:49.642 --> 30:52.210
"Grievances with the
king" to the bottom.

30:52.211 --> 30:54.579
I feel it more fully represents

30:54.580 --> 30:57.416
the will of our fellow countrymen and...

30:57.417 --> 30:59.818
will more likely better withstand

30:59.819 --> 31:01.319
scrutiny from Congress.

31:01.320 --> 31:03.755
Ah, clever. Clever and justified.

31:03.756 --> 31:07.325
This document will change
the course of our struggle.

31:07.326 --> 31:08.427
Well, that is the hope.

31:08.428 --> 31:10.195
A declaration of independence.

31:10.196 --> 31:12.731
<i>The</i> Declaration of Independence.

31:12.732 --> 31:14.399
This will show the crown...
and the world...

31:14.400 --> 31:16.835
that our destiny is our own.

31:16.836 --> 31:18.136
Well done.

31:19.405 --> 31:21.773
We may unite these colonies after all.

31:23.009 --> 31:25.711
Oh, and if I might.

31:25.712 --> 31:29.614
I was reshelving some of the
books in your study, and this...

31:29.615 --> 31:32.017
this fell out of the pages.

31:32.018 --> 31:34.086
Byzantine architecture is

31:34.087 --> 31:36.121
a minor passion of mine.

31:36.122 --> 31:37.356
I'd be happy to further research...

31:37.357 --> 31:38.957
That won't be necessary, Crane.

31:38.958 --> 31:40.359
Thank you.

31:40.360 --> 31:41.593
Sir...?

31:41.594 --> 31:44.262
That will be all.

31:47.066 --> 31:51.236
<i>I had no choice but
to rebuff you, Crane.</i>

31:54.807 --> 31:57.409
You built all this for us.

31:57.410 --> 32:03.048
This chamber and its purpose
is my proudest achievement.

32:03.049 --> 32:05.217
That you are both here, now,

32:05.218 --> 32:07.252
in the flesh...

32:07.253 --> 32:11.456
is the fulfillment of my grandest hopes.

32:11.457 --> 32:14.926
All due respect, sir, I can't imagine

32:14.927 --> 32:17.296
any mentor who would advocate

32:17.297 --> 32:18.797
protecting research over

32:18.798 --> 32:20.766
saving innocent American lives.

32:20.767 --> 32:23.535
Choices in war are rarely clear.

32:25.004 --> 32:27.005
You, Abigail,

32:27.006 --> 32:30.976
were chosen for this centuries ago...

32:30.977 --> 32:34.246
you, among all others...

32:34.247 --> 32:37.916
to win a war we could not.

32:37.917 --> 32:41.286
The information in this chamber
can help you achieve victory.

32:41.287 --> 32:44.957
So, please, choose your next actions

32:44.958 --> 32:47.426
very carefully.

32:47.427 --> 32:50.061
Mr. President...

32:54.534 --> 32:56.535
...this is the path that we have to take.

32:56.536 --> 32:59.805
The lieutenant's right.

32:59.806 --> 33:02.374
The choice is clear.

33:04.110 --> 33:06.678
Lieutenant.

33:16.523 --> 33:19.257
(snoring, raspy breathing)

33:40.480 --> 33:44.916
(quietly): Gentlemen, time we left.

33:46.653 --> 33:48.787
(raspy breathing)

33:54.227 --> 33:57.562
(raspy breathing)

34:06.506 --> 34:07.939
(sudden gasp)

34:09.576 --> 34:11.376
(Reavers growling, snarling)

34:18.418 --> 34:19.784
(growling)

34:31.598 --> 34:34.600
Crane!

34:35.802 --> 34:37.069
(growling)

34:37.070 --> 34:40.205
ABBIE: Everybody, get topside.

34:40.206 --> 34:41.607
We've got your backs. Out the door!

34:41.608 --> 34:43.308
Quickly!

34:43.309 --> 34:46.210
(growling)

34:46.212 --> 34:50.482
Daniel!

34:50.483 --> 34:52.417
(growling)

34:54.320 --> 34:55.920
(growling) Out!

35:01.227 --> 35:03.862
Lieutenant?

35:04.931 --> 35:06.365
(growling)

35:08.835 --> 35:11.303
(panting)

35:11.304 --> 35:13.238
(muffled growling)

35:13.239 --> 35:16.675
Those creatures are way too dangerous.

35:16.676 --> 35:19.345
- We have to blow it.
- Regrettably, yes.

35:19.346 --> 35:21.848
The only way to be certain is

35:21.849 --> 35:23.950
to destroy the power
source for the Fenestella.

35:23.951 --> 35:25.618
Means we lose the whole damn thing.

35:25.619 --> 35:30.590
All that knowledge lost, but
I suppose we have the Internet.

35:30.591 --> 35:31.691
CALVIN: Abbie...

35:31.692 --> 35:33.693
He's going into shock.

35:33.694 --> 35:36.162
These men need medical help.

35:36.163 --> 35:37.997
You take them above ground,

35:37.998 --> 35:40.433
I shall take it from here.

35:40.434 --> 35:42.001
Crane...

35:42.002 --> 35:44.370
As you have so aptly put it before:

35:44.371 --> 35:46.806
"I've got this."

35:46.807 --> 35:49.308
It gets hairy, you call me for backup.

35:49.309 --> 35:50.676
Understood.

36:02.289 --> 36:03.725
(growling, snarling)

36:21.166 --> 36:22.467
(growling)

36:37.417 --> 36:39.818
Ichabod, listen to reason.

36:39.819 --> 36:42.187
Please, open this gate.

36:42.188 --> 36:43.689
Think of all you and
Miss Mills could achieve

36:43.690 --> 36:45.257
with the information here.

36:45.258 --> 36:46.625
The Reavers pose a far greater threat

36:46.626 --> 36:48.694
- than you realize.
- This chamber

36:48.695 --> 36:50.262
and these caverns will contain them.

36:50.263 --> 36:52.130
From the America you knew.

36:52.131 --> 36:54.166
Not the one that exists now.

36:54.167 --> 36:57.703
It has grown beyond
our wildest aspirations.

36:57.704 --> 37:00.539
What was once open fields above us

37:00.540 --> 37:03.642
is now home to 300 million citizens.

37:03.643 --> 37:06.945
Three of them have stumbled
across your Fenestella.

37:06.946 --> 37:09.348
There will be more.

37:09.349 --> 37:11.950
You once told me

37:11.951 --> 37:15.220
a single life is worth more
than a thousand books.

37:15.221 --> 37:18.857
The work that we did together...

37:18.858 --> 37:22.828
those truths still hold.

37:23.963 --> 37:26.965
It truly pained me

37:26.966 --> 37:29.534
that I rebuffed you in the
manner that I did, Crane.

37:31.304 --> 37:33.405
But I was determined

37:33.406 --> 37:35.173
to deliver all this to you intact

37:35.174 --> 37:36.842
when the day finally came.

37:36.843 --> 37:38.844
When fate demanded.

37:38.845 --> 37:41.813
And now you tell me
it must all be destroyed.

37:41.814 --> 37:44.149
The casualties of war, indeed.

37:44.150 --> 37:45.517
"Destroyed."

37:45.518 --> 37:49.054
But not the ideals of
the man who built it.

37:49.055 --> 37:52.424
Yours is the greatest
mind I've ever known.

37:52.425 --> 37:56.395
The price I paid in building all this

37:56.396 --> 37:59.665
was our friendship.

37:59.666 --> 38:02.200
You, too,

38:02.201 --> 38:04.770
are a founder of this country.

38:04.771 --> 38:06.605
And to have found a way to live

38:06.606 --> 38:09.575
in the future that we dreamed of?

38:09.576 --> 38:12.778
This nation could not
be in better hands.

38:14.914 --> 38:16.848
Set your detonation point there.

38:16.849 --> 38:20.185
The chain reaction will
destroy this chamber

38:20.186 --> 38:22.387
and every Reaver within these tunnels.

38:25.692 --> 38:27.125
(beep)

38:28.628 --> 38:31.363
And you?

38:31.364 --> 38:33.465
(growling, snarling, hissing)

38:33.466 --> 38:36.034
My time has come and gone.

38:36.035 --> 38:38.871
Yours is still unfolding...

38:38.872 --> 38:40.606
my friend.

38:40.607 --> 38:41.940
Mr. President.

38:46.246 --> 38:48.881
Lieutenant!

38:48.882 --> 38:51.083
Crane!

39:08.601 --> 39:10.402
Ah...

39:10.403 --> 39:14.072
We just blew up the author of the
Declaration of Independence.

39:14.073 --> 39:17.309
Truth be told, he insisted.

39:18.511 --> 39:20.679
(sirens wailing in distance)

39:20.680 --> 39:22.881
(indistinct radio communication)

39:27.253 --> 39:31.190
So... the official story will be
that some kind of rabid animal

39:31.191 --> 39:33.425
was down in the tunnels with these guys?

39:33.426 --> 39:34.793
Yup.

39:34.794 --> 39:36.428
And during the rescue,
a gas main ruptured.

39:36.429 --> 39:38.163
- Took out any and all evidence.
- That's right.

39:38.164 --> 39:39.765
And in their exhaustion,

39:39.766 --> 39:42.501
and extreme dehydration,
there's no telling

39:42.502 --> 39:45.003
what kind of hallucinations
they might have.

39:45.004 --> 39:47.873
And you're wondering
if I'm gonna keep digging.

39:47.874 --> 39:49.842
Your brother's safe. Why push it?

39:49.843 --> 39:51.376
You go through creepy trapdoors.

39:51.377 --> 39:53.612
Me? I push till I get to the truth.

39:53.613 --> 39:55.047
Mm-hmm.

39:55.048 --> 39:56.782
Well, people have a right to know.

39:56.783 --> 39:59.485
What you do is important, Calvin.

39:59.486 --> 40:00.953
And, yes, there will be a time

40:00.954 --> 40:02.821
for the public to know everything.

40:02.822 --> 40:04.123
Just not right now.

40:04.124 --> 40:05.625
And you're the one to decide that?

40:05.626 --> 40:07.826
They will be other threats.

40:07.827 --> 40:09.795
More people who need our help.

40:09.796 --> 40:13.298
So, yes, for now, I make the call.

40:13.299 --> 40:15.200
Question is...

40:15.201 --> 40:17.069
are you on our side?

40:21.341 --> 40:23.575
It's a good story, isn't it?

40:23.576 --> 40:26.545
Very.

40:26.546 --> 40:28.380
(wry laugh)

40:30.517 --> 40:32.251
All right.

40:32.252 --> 40:35.420
Mm-hmm.

40:38.725 --> 40:40.759
Hey!

40:41.828 --> 40:44.029
Check your e-mail.

40:47.033 --> 40:50.035
(ambulance door shuts)

41:26.139 --> 41:30.077
Your rest was most fitful, Mother.

41:30.944 --> 41:32.945
- Henry...
- Yes.

41:32.946 --> 41:34.780
How-how is it possible?

41:34.781 --> 41:38.050
You must wonder how I could've
survived what happened.

41:38.051 --> 41:39.251
(yells)

41:43.256 --> 41:45.591
You're still alive.

41:45.592 --> 41:46.992
I was away.

41:46.993 --> 41:49.461
Sorting things out.

41:49.462 --> 41:51.463
Call it wanderlust.

41:51.464 --> 41:52.798
As you know,

41:52.799 --> 41:55.668
I believed Moloch
to be my true father.

41:55.669 --> 41:59.071
But after his betrayal,

41:59.072 --> 42:01.140
I was unsure of my path.

42:01.141 --> 42:02.608
What do you want from me?

42:02.609 --> 42:05.100
If you still seek to harm me, I...

42:05.101 --> 42:06.568
No. No.

42:06.569 --> 42:08.904
I-I now know

42:08.905 --> 42:12.741
why I did what I did.

42:12.742 --> 42:14.476
I killed Moloch

42:14.477 --> 42:16.979
for you, Mother.

42:16.980 --> 42:20.249
For our kind.

42:20.250 --> 42:23.685
It's time for us to begin our work.

42:25.789 --> 42:27.356
(gasps)

42:56.295 --> 43:00.040
