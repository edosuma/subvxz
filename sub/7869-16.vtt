WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:06.171
(jabbers nonsense)

00:09.577 --> 00:11.744
(exclaiming)

00:15.683 --> 00:18.250
(school bell ringing)

00:20.521 --> 00:21.520
(Barney belches)

00:21.522 --> 00:23.622
(whistle blows)

00:23.624 --> 00:26.058
(yells)

00:29.797 --> 00:31.196
(beeping)

00:36.203 --> 00:38.637
(playing the blues)

00:39.340 --> 00:43.108
(playing the blues)

00:43.110 --> 00:45.811
(tires screeching)

00:45.813 --> 00:47.079
D'oh!

00:47.081 --> 00:48.447
(tires screeching)

00:48.449 --> 00:50.349
(grunts)

00:52.553 --> 00:54.453
(grunting)

01:02.263 --> 01:03.796
The Queen will be held
without bail

01:03.798 --> 01:06.298
until the sample
is returned from the lab.

01:06.300 --> 01:10.469
And now it's time
for "That's Kent-ertainment!"

01:23.451 --> 01:25.551
Here's a story
that gives new meaning

01:25.553 --> 01:27.152
to the words "puff piece."

01:27.154 --> 01:29.188
Springfield natives
Cheech and Chong

01:29.190 --> 01:32.157
are returning in triumph
for a reunion show.

01:32.159 --> 01:34.593
Cheech and Chong are coming
back to Springfield?

01:34.595 --> 01:36.795
Cheech and Chong
are from Springfield?

01:36.797 --> 01:38.697
Lucy and Desi
are getting a divorce?

01:38.699 --> 01:41.266
BROCKMAN:<i> Before they formed</i>
<i>their "joint" partnership,</i>

01:41.268 --> 01:42.601
<i>Tommy Chong</i>
<i>and Richard "Cheech" Marin</i>

01:42.603 --> 01:45.571
<i>briefly worked as Channel 6</i>
<i>meteorologists.</i>

01:45.573 --> 01:47.372
Tomorrow, a
high-pressure front

01:47.374 --> 01:49.441
brings a strong
possibility of drizzle.

01:49.443 --> 01:53.278
BROCKMAN:
<i>Then, the doobie of destiny</i>
<i>changed their lives forever,</i>

01:53.280 --> 01:54.780
<i>when police</i>
<i>burned marijuana seized</i>

01:54.782 --> 01:58.350
<i>from the Buddy Rich Orchestra</i>
<i>in a nearby lot.</i>

01:58.352 --> 02:01.720
(coughs) So, you know,
uh, check your barometer,

02:01.722 --> 02:03.822
thermometer,
anemometer...

02:03.824 --> 02:06.592
Why does everything have
to have an "ometer" on it?

02:06.594 --> 02:07.793
And what is
rain, man?

02:07.795 --> 02:10.429
It's like we're in the
apartment under God

02:10.431 --> 02:13.365
and his fat sister
overflowed the tub.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.366
(both chuckling)

02:14.368 --> 02:16.835
The duo's herbal ha-has
led to a series

02:16.837 --> 02:21.206
of successful albums, concerts,
movies and<i> Nash Bridges.</i>

02:21.208 --> 02:25.444
Now these homegrown heroes
will kick off their summer tour

02:25.446 --> 02:27.079
at Squidport's new amphitheater,

02:27.081 --> 02:30.549
<i>the Clamphitheater,</i>
<i>the $800 million boondoggle</i>

02:30.551 --> 02:33.886
<i>based on nothing more</i>
<i>than a cute play on words.</i>

02:33.888 --> 02:36.255
Who the hell
are Cheech and Chong?

02:36.257 --> 02:37.756
(gasps)
Bart, Cheech and Chong

02:37.758 --> 02:40.592
were the Beavis and Butthead
of their day.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.427
Who are Beavis and Butthead?

02:42.429 --> 02:43.428
(sobs)

02:43.430 --> 02:44.630
I've failed as a parent.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.798
I swore the day
my son was born

02:46.800 --> 02:49.268
he would appreciate
stoner comedy.

02:49.270 --> 02:49.935
To the media room!

02:49.937 --> 02:51.803
CHONG (on record): Open up.
It's the police.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.773
CHEECH: Oh, man.
I got to get rid of my grass.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.241
(toilet flushing)

02:56.243 --> 02:56.808
(laughing)

02:56.810 --> 03:00.779
He's flushing his pot
down the toilet-- unnecessarily!

03:00.781 --> 03:02.781
(laughs, sighs)

03:02.783 --> 03:06.618
Back then, we'd play
these albums again and again

03:06.620 --> 03:10.422
till they were filled with skips
and clicks and pops.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.291
Which was about three times.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.193
These are
comedy albums?

03:14.195 --> 03:14.893
The Noisy Minority.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.496
The Upside-Down
Bubblegum Collective.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.764
The Regional Lampoon.

03:18.766 --> 03:21.233
The Plymouth Grok Experiment.

03:21.235 --> 03:21.833
Fro And Flo.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.902
Allan Sherman's
Helter Shmelter.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.238
MARGE: What are you guys
doing up there?

03:26.240 --> 03:27.539
(gasps)
Hide the dope!

03:27.541 --> 03:28.640
We don't have any dope.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.576
Then, what did I just smoke?

03:30.578 --> 03:31.877
(screams)

03:36.650 --> 03:39.585
Lou, I want you to
confiscate these brownies.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.420
There's no drugs
in these brownies.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.454
I said "confiscate"!

03:42.456 --> 03:46.325
Uh, also confiscate me
a T-shirt, uh triple-XL.

03:46.327 --> 03:49.928
I thought you said double-XL
was a real wake-up call.

03:49.930 --> 03:50.963
That was for pants.

03:50.965 --> 03:53.966
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
Krusty the Clown.

03:53.968 --> 03:54.633
Thank you.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.969
When they asked me
to introduce Cheech and Chong,

03:56.971 --> 03:58.337
I said, "How much?"

03:58.339 --> 04:00.739
And they said, "We don't pay
for introductions,"

04:00.741 --> 04:04.309
so I said, "Then I don't need
this crummy gig."

04:04.311 --> 04:07.679
And they said, "Yes, you do,"
and I said...

04:07.681 --> 04:09.848
"Ladies and gentlemen,
Cheech and Chong!"

04:09.850 --> 04:11.683
(applause and cheering)

04:11.685 --> 04:12.517
(knocking)

04:12.519 --> 04:14.786
Who is it?
It's me, Dave, man.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.588
Open up.
I got the stuff.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.557
(gasps)
I thought they'd do bits,

04:18.559 --> 04:20.092
but their most famous bit?

04:20.094 --> 04:22.494
Will you open up?
I got the stuff with me.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.397
Ooh, he's gonna say
"Dave's not here."

04:25.399 --> 04:27.933
Dave's not here!
Dave's not here!

04:27.935 --> 04:29.968
ALL (chanting):
Dave's not here!

04:29.970 --> 04:31.603
Dave's not here!

04:31.605 --> 04:32.638
Say the line, man.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.306
They already know the line.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.507
What's the surprise?

04:35.509 --> 04:36.475
What's the point?

04:36.477 --> 04:37.876
The point is
they still give us

04:37.878 --> 04:40.012
a shoebox full of 20s
to do this.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.847
Now, say it.

04:41.849 --> 04:42.914
Dave's not...

04:42.916 --> 04:45.784
Dave's not gonna sell out
anymore, man.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.686
I-I can't say it.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.521
(all gasping)

04:49.523 --> 04:51.390
What are you doing, man?!

04:51.392 --> 04:52.758
What am I doing?
What am I...

04:52.760 --> 04:53.925
I'm experimenting, man.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.894
I'm growing as
an artist, okay?

04:55.896 --> 04:58.563
That's not the
Cheech and Chong brand.

04:58.565 --> 04:59.831
Brand? Brand?

04:59.833 --> 05:01.033
I'm a 72-year-old man.

05:01.035 --> 05:03.602
I've eaten eggs every which way
they cook 'em.

05:03.604 --> 05:04.836
I can't play it safe anymore.

05:04.838 --> 05:08.640
Look, these people pay good
money to see "Dave's not here."

05:08.642 --> 05:10.542
You owe them "Dave's not here."

05:10.544 --> 05:12.311
Well, how about this?

05:12.313 --> 05:15.547
Chong's not here, man.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.518
(audience grumbling)

05:19.520 --> 05:20.052
Oh, no.

05:20.054 --> 05:21.720
Chong is refusing to fall back

05:21.722 --> 05:23.422
on his old catchphrases.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.489
<i>Ay, caramba.</i>

05:24.491 --> 05:25.524
(audience murmuring angrily)

05:25.526 --> 05:28.093
Homie, you know
all the bits.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.361
Maybe you could help him.

05:29.363 --> 05:31.863
I can't do reefer comedy.
I'm drunk.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.365
Two different animals.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.434
Homer Simpson,
that man's albums

05:35.436 --> 05:37.536
have given you decades
of entertainment

05:37.538 --> 05:41.039
and seen you through
some very square times.

05:41.041 --> 05:41.740
Help him.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.576
(audience murmuring
in agreement)

05:50.784 --> 05:55.020
Dave's not here, man.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.755
(laughter)

05:59.560 --> 06:01.827
No, man, I'm Dave.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.428
D-A-V-E.

06:03.430 --> 06:03.929
Dave?

06:03.931 --> 06:06.031
That's right.
Now open up the door.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.500
Dave's not here, man.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.935
(laughter)

06:12.039 --> 06:13.438
(laughing)

06:13.440 --> 06:14.673
(laughter continues)

06:14.675 --> 06:16.007
You find this
funny, sir?

06:16.009 --> 06:19.611
Just because it's too hip
for you, Smithers...

06:19.613 --> 06:21.880
♪ ♪

06:23.851 --> 06:26.685
HOMER:
I'll give Dave your message.

06:26.687 --> 06:29.121
I don't find this funny at all.

06:29.123 --> 06:33.625
My time being wasted
was not wasted.

06:33.627 --> 06:34.860
(all cheering)

06:34.862 --> 06:37.529
Hey, man, you're
all right.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.998
How'd you like to
be the new Chong?

06:40.000 --> 06:40.932
Yes.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.033
Will I get to meet Dave?

06:42.035 --> 06:43.001
There is no Dave.

06:43.003 --> 06:43.935
How about Don Johnson?

06:43.937 --> 06:46.571
It would be easier
to meet Dave.

06:51.612 --> 06:52.010
(smooching)

06:52.012 --> 06:55.714
It is so cool for you to let me
go on tour with Cheech.

06:55.716 --> 06:56.848
And remember,

06:56.850 --> 06:58.517
on the road,
the only vice

06:58.519 --> 07:00.152
you can indulge in
is gluttony.

07:00.154 --> 07:03.555
Save lust and rage
for me and the kids.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.956
Sweetie, don't worry.

07:04.958 --> 07:08.760
I'm gonna come back
so horny and angry.

07:08.762 --> 07:09.194
Aw...

07:09.196 --> 07:12.764
I can't believe I'm riding
around in Cheech's van.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.499
The van made of weed.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.034
It's not made of weed.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.536
Oh. What's it made of?

07:17.538 --> 07:18.670
Hash? 'Shrooms?

07:18.672 --> 07:21.606
Lysergic acid diethylamide?

07:21.608 --> 07:24.709
No. The van is just made of van.

07:24.711 --> 07:25.510
Oh...

07:25.512 --> 07:26.978
Look, Homer, I
really need you

07:26.980 --> 07:28.213
to be on your
game, you know?

07:28.215 --> 07:30.549
A lot of our fans have
gone through rehab,

07:30.551 --> 07:32.017
so they're much
more critical.

07:32.019 --> 07:32.951
Don't worry, Cheech.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.887
I know all the classic bits
of you and Chong.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.789
Don't say that name.
Now, you drive.

07:37.791 --> 07:38.957
I have to go
black out his face

07:38.959 --> 07:40.459
on some T-shirts
with a Magic Marker.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.894
(gasps)
Can we get high
from the fumes?

07:42.896 --> 07:44.129
No!

07:44.131 --> 07:45.931
(muttering indistinctly)

07:55.876 --> 07:58.910
Okay, man, what I'm looking for
in a new Cheech

07:58.912 --> 08:02.814
is someone who is, like,
open-minded and adventurous.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.250
I haven't decided
about the mustache yet,

08:05.252 --> 08:07.752
but you need your
own suspenders.

08:07.754 --> 08:08.854
Snap, snap.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.889
Our friendship died
with the first snap,

08:10.891 --> 08:13.225
and you buried it
with the second.

08:13.227 --> 08:16.094
You ever notice how your nose
makes boogers?

08:16.096 --> 08:17.996
What's up with that?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.664
Uh, next?

08:19.666 --> 08:22.167
I can't pay the rent.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.835
You must pay the rent.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.737
I can't pay the rent.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.005
You must pay the rent.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.007
I'll pay the rent.

08:29.009 --> 08:29.708
My hero.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.811
Aw, who am I kidding?
I don't got the money.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.746
(groans):
Ooh... Next?

08:34.748 --> 08:37.215
(speaking indistinctly)

08:44.024 --> 08:45.824
Zoom.

08:46.260 --> 08:48.860
I am your substitute teacher,

08:48.862 --> 08:50.295
Sister Mary Elephant.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.831
Class, attention, attention,

08:52.833 --> 08:54.966
class, class. Shut up.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.067
Thank you.

08:56.069 --> 08:56.968
Uh, no, man.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.603
No routines from
the old regime.

08:58.605 --> 09:01.139
Really? But Sister Mary's
no-nonsense attitude

09:01.141 --> 09:03.275
is what inspired me
to become an educator.

09:03.277 --> 09:05.610
Just let your freak
flag fly, man.

09:05.612 --> 09:08.013
Well, I guess
as long as I fold it afterward

09:08.015 --> 09:09.047
and don't display it at night...

09:09.049 --> 09:12.817
Oh, perhaps I should improvise,
or do an improv?

09:12.819 --> 09:14.819
I want you
to reinvent the wheel.

09:14.821 --> 09:17.055
No, de-invent the wheel.

09:17.057 --> 09:17.822
No.

09:17.824 --> 09:20.058
"Re-unvent the whool."

09:20.060 --> 09:21.927
Oh, I'll get my prop trunk.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.129
A lot of people
have cell phones,

09:24.131 --> 09:25.830
but I like to eat healthy,

09:25.832 --> 09:28.800
So I invented...
the celery phone.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.201
Hello? Hello?

09:30.203 --> 09:34.339
Wow. You are the un-funniest man
I've ever seen.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.007
Which means, teaming up with you

09:36.009 --> 09:37.776
would be totally
pushing the envelope.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.778
Mother,
how did you get this number?

09:39.780 --> 09:41.079
It's a prop phone.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.681
Yes, I have your celery.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.183
I took the limpest
stalk there was.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.218
Stop it. Stop riffing.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.887
The gig is yours.

09:49.189 --> 09:53.224
Time to finally return
your father's overdue movies.

09:53.226 --> 09:56.194
Is it really okay to just
drop them into the pit

09:56.196 --> 09:58.063
where the Blockbuster
used to be?

09:58.065 --> 09:59.064
Got a better idea?

09:59.066 --> 10:02.233

Santa's Little Helper barks)

Um, hello.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.911
I'm Marge Simpson.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.780
I think I've given you money
a couple of times.

10:15.782 --> 10:16.848
(muttering incoherently)

10:16.850 --> 10:19.985
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't want the money back.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.786
I just came for my dog.

pinball game parts,

10:34.368 --> 10:37.736

10:37.738 --> 10:41.139
sample-sized shampoos,
detergents and whiskeys, and...

10:41.141 --> 10:44.175
I hate to say this
about the Cat Lady,

10:44.177 --> 10:46.177
but I think she's crazy.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.879
She's a hoarder.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.781
(muttering incoherently)

10:49.783 --> 10:51.282
This is so sad.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.250
Can we help her?

10:52.252 --> 10:53.952
We can. It'll be great.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.721
Like a reality show
without the cameras.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.757
You mean, just reality.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.258
Yeah, that's what you think.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.894

this was gonna be fun.

11:39.032 --> 11:39.864
It is fun!

11:39.866 --> 11:42.000

Yeah.

Oh! Why aren't you exactly
like your stage persona?

15:14.648 --> 15:18.449
Now Homer, this Viramontes
image is an example

15:18.451 --> 15:21.953
of how Chicano poster art
preserves a culture ignored

15:21.955 --> 15:23.554
by Eurocentric society.

15:59.192 --> 16:03.428

menu is funnier than you.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.396
Yeah.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.733
Yes, but I'm funnier
than the cocktail napkins.

16:08.735 --> 16:09.667
They're blank, Seymour.

16:09.669 --> 16:13.504
Yes, but there are two "K"
sounds in cocktail.

16:13.506 --> 16:14.706
Yes, there are.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.343
So, how was<i> your</i>
first day of school?

16:18.345 --> 16:20.578
I met the new principal,
Mr. Baumgartner.

16:20.580 --> 16:21.546
He seemed really cool.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.749
When he walked through the gym,
he shot a basket.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.411
I never thought
I'd say this,

16:53.413 --> 16:57.115
but Dad is the only
one who can help us.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.216
(phone vibrating)

16:58.218 --> 17:00.451
Now, Homer,
what did we agree

17:00.453 --> 17:03.121
about personal phone calls
during rehearsal time?

17:03.123 --> 17:03.788
(sighs)

17:03.790 --> 17:06.090
It's disrespectful
to the high standards

17:06.092 --> 17:08.760
people have come to expect
from Cheech and Chunk.

17:08.762 --> 17:11.095
That's right. Now let's take it
from the part

17:11.097 --> 17:12.663
where we sniff
each other's butts.

17:12.665 --> 17:13.364
Yes, sir.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.599
Come on, sniff!

17:14.601 --> 17:16.167
(Homer sniffing)

17:16.169 --> 17:18.169
That's a movie sniff.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.737
This is live theater.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.472
Now inhale, damn it.

17:21.474 --> 17:22.673
(Homer inhales loudly
through nose)

17:22.675 --> 17:26.444
I'm hearing it,
but I'm not feeling it.

17:26.446 --> 17:29.247
(sniffing)
Oh!

would throw out all these forks.

17:44.130 --> 17:44.729
Marge, sweetie,

17:44.731 --> 17:47.665
do you know how low,
low prices are insane?

17:47.667 --> 17:50.535
Well, sometimes
people can be, too.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.236
What are you talking about?

17:52.238 --> 17:54.072
Marge, you saved me.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.640
Now I want to save you.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.375
I'm not a hoarder.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.477
Do the Yankees<i> hoard</i> pennants?

17:59.479 --> 18:02.313
Does Marrakesh<i> hoard</i> intrigue?

18:02.315 --> 18:05.183
Marge, Marge,
what can one person

18:05.185 --> 18:06.184
honestly do with...?

18:06.186 --> 18:09.787
Filled-in mini
golf score sheets.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.322

But...

18:28.875 --> 18:30.374
Don't look
back, Marge.

18:30.376 --> 18:31.209
Don't look back.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.545
Let's just leave the crazy
woman alone in our house.

18:34.547 --> 18:37.748
You've got something more
important to attend to.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.518
(Tarzan-like scream)

18:41.454 --> 18:45.623

Uh, we'll deal with
all that later.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.692

and whistling)

18:47.694 --> 18:50.595

and revving)

18:52.799 --> 18:53.865
(laughs)

18:53.867 --> 18:56.234
Hey, baby, want a ride?

18:56.236 --> 18:56.734
Come on.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.236
If Art Garfunkel
could forgive

18:58.238 --> 19:02.707

Paul Simon, you can do this.

19:05.912 --> 19:09.480
(cheering and applause)

19:09.482 --> 19:12.216
Uh, uh, what'd you
do with Chunk, man?

19:12.218 --> 19:13.584
<i>He</i> sent me out here, man.

19:13.586 --> 19:16.787
He's got this idea
I'm unhappy with my new partner.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.524
I decided to put
family over career.

19:19.526 --> 19:23.327
You mean you put nothing
over nothing.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.497
(loud whisper):
Tell him how you feel.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.499
I feel super high.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.634
Yeah. Me, too.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.769
Come on! Surrender
to the moment!

19:31.771 --> 19:34.505
Don't make the
mistake I always do

19:34.507 --> 19:38.209
of thinking too
much before you act!

19:39.646 --> 19:40.344
(grunts)

19:40.346 --> 19:41.846
(imitates engine
revving and chugging)

19:41.848 --> 19:44.448
I guess people do like
the classic bits.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.449
You know what?

19:45.451 --> 19:48.719
It's okay if you want to
experiment a little like...

19:48.721 --> 19:50.922
Oh, Thomas!

19:50.924 --> 19:52.490
Oh, Richard!

19:52.492 --> 19:53.958
(applause and cheering)

19:53.960 --> 19:55.893
(Marge moans)

19:56.963 --> 19:59.564
I'm sorry I mocked
your lack of suspenders.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.799
I guess I was just
jealous of your belt.

20:01.801 --> 20:05.369
This belt has caused too
many fights between us.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.906
(tires squealing)

20:10.410 --> 20:12.944
Now, now, mad spirits,
before we part,

20:12.946 --> 20:16.514
'tis I, mischievous
and puckish Bart.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.316
(wind whistling)

20:18.318 --> 20:20.484
'Twas not I
the players did disturb.

20:20.486 --> 20:23.821
'Twas the doings
of a green and naughty herb.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.791
The gods have
righted every wrong.

20:26.793 --> 20:30.428
Cheech, the stoner,
has his Chong.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.630
And Homer-- he is
back with Mom.

20:32.632 --> 20:36.200
You can watch this
tomorrow at Hulu.com.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.006
(knocking)
CHONG:
<i>Who is it?</i>

20:42.008 --> 20:43.774
CHEECH:
<i>It's me, Dave, man.</i>

20:43.776 --> 20:45.309
<i>Open up. I</i>
<i>got the stuff!</i>

20:45.311 --> 20:46.644
<i>Who?</i>
<i>Dave, man!</i>

20:46.646 --> 20:47.578
<i>Dave's not here.</i>

20:47.580 --> 20:49.347
HOMER:<i> Hold on,</i>
<i>let me get the door here.</i>

20:49.349 --> 20:51.382
(door squeaks open)
<i>Who are you?</i>

20:51.384 --> 20:53.317
<i>It's Dave, man.</i>
<i>You ruined it, man.</i>

20:53.319 --> 20:54.952
<i>You weren't supposed</i>
<i>to open the door.</i>

20:54.954 --> 20:56.887
<i>Oh, okay, wait,</i>
<i>let's start again.</i>

20:56.889 --> 20:57.755
<i>Close the door.</i>

20:57.757 --> 20:59.523
<i>I'll be out here</i>
<i>with you, Dave.</i>

20:59.525 --> 21:00.758
(door closes)
<i>Hey, Homer?</i>
<i>Yes?</i>

21:00.760 --> 21:02.326
<i>Why don't you go and</i>
<i>get us some stuff?</i>

21:02.328 --> 21:03.961
<i>Okay. I'll go get some stuff.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

21:03.963 --> 21:06.497
<i>Way down there. Way,</i>
<i>way, way far down there.</i>

21:06.499 --> 21:07.632
<i>Way down here?</i>
<i>Yeah, way.</i>

21:07.634 --> 21:09.100
<i>Yeah, keep going!</i>
<i>Keep going!</i>
(mutters)

21:09.102 --> 21:10.835
<i>Now turn the corner!</i>
<i>Turn the corner!</i>

21:10.837 --> 21:12.470
<i>Okay!</i>
<i>All right,</i>
<i>keep going!</i>

21:12.472 --> 21:14.005
(in distance)
<i>All right!</i>

21:14.007 --> 21:15.806
(knocking)
<i>Who is it?</i>

21:15.808 --> 21:18.342
<i>It's me, relieved!</i>

21:21.881 --> 21:24.582
HOMER:
<i>Gee, sorry, Dave!</i>
