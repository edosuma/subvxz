WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:09.927
Okay, ladies,
it's time to turn up the heat.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.261
You got this.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.138
Give me a knee.

00:13.222 --> 00:14.806
Knee. You got this.

00:14.890 --> 00:15.974
Knee!

00:16.058 --> 00:17.100
To the side.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.894
That's right. Keep it up.

00:18.977 --> 00:22.147
Knee, right, two, three. Knee. Other side.

00:22.231 --> 00:27.778
And jumping jacks.
Jacking. Jacking. Up, out, in, out.

00:28.779 --> 00:31.573
This is when that voice starts, right?
In your head.

00:31.657 --> 00:36.495
It's saying slow down.
Take a break. It's a little hard.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.080
Are we gonna listen to that voice?

00:38.163 --> 00:39.164
No!

00:39.248 --> 00:40.499
I can't hear you.

00:40.582 --> 00:43.752
-Are you gonna listen to that voice?
-No!

00:43.836 --> 00:47.631
Let's take it to the front.
And one, two, three, knee!

00:48.674 --> 00:51.093
Knee! Whoo!

00:51.885 --> 00:53.971
Knee! Whoo.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.639
Legs nice and wide.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.183
Drop that butt. That's it.

00:58.267 --> 00:59.768
Deep squat.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.186
For five, six,

01:01.270 --> 01:03.105
five, six, seven, eight.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.399
Press to the left.

01:05.983 --> 01:08.861
And swing the hips. Swing, swing, swing

01:08.944 --> 01:13.699
for eight, seven, six, five, four, three,

01:14.324 --> 01:16.410
two, one, out.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.875
Feel the twist in your waist.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.421
Shake it, ladies.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.424
Shake it, don't break it. Shake and two.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.762
I heard they sold out every VCR
they had in stock.

02:17.596 --> 02:20.766
People wanting to do the workout tape
they bought today at home.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.559
-It's pretty impressive.
-Thank you.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.852
Auggie Cartwright.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.187
With Stahl/Grunner,

02:25.270 --> 02:27.689
producers of programming
for the home video market.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.816
Obviously you've really
got something here.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.735
If you don't mind me asking, what's next?

02:32.361 --> 02:34.863
It's all happened very fast.
I don't exactly know yet.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.241
Well, I might.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.701
And if you let me
buy you a fruit smoothie,

02:39.785 --> 02:40.953
I also just might tell you.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.413
I can meet you at the food court in ten.

02:47.251 --> 02:48.252
Works for me.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.130
Yeah, but, you know, more signatures.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.424
Just make sure people know
where their polling places are.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.884
That's where some of the--

02:55.968 --> 02:58.387
Sheila, what a turnout. That was electric.

02:58.470 --> 03:01.515
Wasn't that electric? And we sold out
of every single videotape we brought.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.142
And we gave away
all the campaign literature too, I hope?

03:04.226 --> 03:07.354
Yep. There was one in every bag.
Republican or democrat, everyone got one.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.358
Wow. You were something up there.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.069
Yeah, I don't think I've ever seen you so…

03:17.656 --> 03:18.490
-So?
-You know…

03:18.574 --> 03:21.660
-Vibrant? Captivating?
-Strong. Strong. Yeah.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.122
We better get back to HQ.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.416
Jerry's got us door knocking
the rest of the day, so…

03:27.499 --> 03:28.500
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

03:29.001 --> 03:31.712
You know, actually,
I should stay and help clean up.

03:31.795 --> 03:34.339
Is it all right if I meet you at home?
It won't take long.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.592
Yeah, sure. Yeah. Totally.

03:37.926 --> 03:42.181
You really were just something else.
Something… else.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.392
All right.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.987
I have some new ideas for us.
For our next tape.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.697
I couldn't sleep last night.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.991
Stress. And speed.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.285
-Do you wanna hear?
-Yeah.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.870
I do. But it's gonna have to be later.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.664
-Is that okay?
-Later's cool. I have stuff too.

04:07.748 --> 04:11.210
-If I don't see you, good luck today.
-Good luck with what?

04:11.293 --> 04:12.878
Election, stupid.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.087
-Yes.
-I hope you win.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.216
Okay. Go.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.218
At Stahl and Grunner,

04:19.301 --> 04:22.763
we produce original programming
in four categories:

04:22.846 --> 04:26.558
entertainment, children's, how-to,
and sports and fitness.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.435
Which is where you come in. I hope.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.022
Come in? How would I come in?

04:34.107 --> 04:37.236
Tell you what, let me answer
your question with a question.

04:38.654 --> 04:40.197
Have you heard of The Drain Guru?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.366
I mean, def-- Of course.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.159
-Everyone's heard of him.
-He's huge, right?

04:44.243 --> 04:47.538
You could be huger.
You've got the skills and the looks.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.747
You're something that someone

04:48.830 --> 04:50.999
would actually like to see
in their house every day.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.252
Not like a clogged toilet. Am I right?

04:53.335 --> 04:55.212
Well, I hope so.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.715
VCRs all over this country
with you inside them.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.593
I already have a tape
that's doing quite well.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.762
Here's what I'm offering you:

05:04.638 --> 05:05.848
professional production,

05:06.390 --> 05:07.891
high-volume reproduction

05:08.642 --> 05:10.686
and widespread distribution.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.146
Take this home,
have your husband walk you through it.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.523
And then call me

05:14.606 --> 05:17.609
so we can start making you
a household name.

05:18.110 --> 05:21.363
Pan Am, Stetson, Sheila.

05:24.116 --> 05:27.786
"You do your Sheila today?"
"I did my Sheila this morning."

05:27.870 --> 05:29.621
"Oh, I do my Sheila every day."

05:30.247 --> 05:31.999
How great does that sound?

05:36.211 --> 05:39.006
-Seemed like it went pretty smoothly.
-I thought so too.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.884
Can I get our deposit back?
We didn't break anything.

05:41.967 --> 05:42.968
Of course.

05:44.178 --> 05:47.598
I would have given it to you earlier,
but I didn't wanna interrupt.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.475
-It looked important.
-What did?

05:51.518 --> 05:54.146
Your conversation.
Man, very expensive briefcase.

05:55.647 --> 05:56.940
Yeah, he--

05:57.566 --> 05:58.734
The production company.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.945
They make tapes of products
and distribution.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.072
The Drain Guru.

06:04.156 --> 06:05.490
The Drain Guru.

06:06.450 --> 06:09.786
So Mr. Briefcase wants to turn you
into The Drain Guru?

06:10.495 --> 06:13.248
-Well, my version of that, but yes.
-And what about your colleague?

06:13.332 --> 06:16.418
The one with the creative approach
to her renter's agreement.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.921
Does he wanna turn her
into The Drain Guru too?

06:19.004 --> 06:21.048
Or is that why she wasn't at the meeting?

06:21.131 --> 06:23.842
We didn't really
get into the details of what--

06:23.926 --> 06:27.221
Of course, but he knows she exists, right?

06:28.096 --> 06:30.891
If what you told me
about your husband's socialist beliefs

06:30.974 --> 06:33.018
being your beliefs is true…

06:36.313 --> 06:38.982
Yeah. I-- I better get home.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.443
-If you ask me--
-I did not ask you.

06:41.527 --> 06:42.528
But if you did,

06:42.611 --> 06:45.155
I'd say anyone interested in
investing in this enterprise

06:45.739 --> 06:47.574
can tell that you are the real draw.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.326
You're the one people came to see.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.579
-Well, it's really none of your business.
-That's right.

06:52.663 --> 06:53.705
It's yours.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.791
Your valuable capital.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.334
Likely, you wanna protect it.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.879
Maybe that's why Ms. Kazam wasn't there
with you and that producer fellow

07:00.963 --> 07:04.299
enjoying a refreshing juice drink
in the food court.

07:05.717 --> 07:09.763
It's barely juice. It's basically soda.
And you don't really know me at all, so…

07:09.847 --> 07:11.014
God knows.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.852
God and, I assume, your husband.

07:17.271 --> 07:18.730
Hey, man. You gotta eat something.

07:19.314 --> 07:22.025
No. Whenever I eat when I'm this tense,
I get the runs.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.861
Yeah, me too. But I never learn.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.696
Sheila. Sheila, I have the paper.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.698
-Jesus Christ.
-Sheila, hang up the phone.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.032
-Thank you.
-You're the front page

07:29.116 --> 07:30.784
-of the style section of the Times.
-What?

07:30.868 --> 07:33.120
Did that bozo even mention our campaign?

07:33.203 --> 07:34.371
Okay, here we go.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.791
"Here's what her growing audience
may not realize,

07:37.875 --> 07:42.212
all proceeds directly fund her husband,
Danny Rubin's grassroots campaign,

07:42.296 --> 07:46.967
a futile but valiant effort
against Republican shoo-in, Mike Schmidt."

07:47.050 --> 07:48.594
Futile but valiant.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.929
Wow, Sheil. Way to get the word out.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.097
It's the Times.

07:52.181 --> 07:54.141
They'll just say anything
to suit their own agenda.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.101
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah, you know, they--

07:56.185 --> 08:00.856
they've wanted us dead since we started.
But we're very much alive, aren't we?

08:00.939 --> 08:01.940
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

08:02.024 --> 08:03.150
Hey, Jerry.

08:03.817 --> 08:07.571
-I'm out 50 bucks.
-Oh, yeah, buddy. Let me--

08:07.654 --> 08:08.655
I have it.

08:08.739 --> 08:09.740
I have it.

08:10.908 --> 08:13.243
-Thanks.
-Thanks, man. Put it in there.

08:14.453 --> 08:15.829
Oh, my God.

08:15.913 --> 08:19.082
It's the entire front page.
The whole thing.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.835
They moved the rest of the campaign stuff
to page two.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.086
You look great, Sheila.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.255
She looks amazing.

08:29.468 --> 08:32.513
Bedroom closet has those
folding accordion doors.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.847
One of 'em might be a little bit broken.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.476
It might have been by me. Just now.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.645
You seriously need to talk quieter, Tyler.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.650
They don't mention me at all.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.945
It's not a real article.
More like a bunch of pictures.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.238
Of her.

08:51.573 --> 08:56.578
It's free publicity for the studio.
I mean, that's what matters anyway, right?

08:56.662 --> 08:58.455
They don't mention the studio at all.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.082
They only talk about her.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.667
Sorry, what?

09:01.750 --> 09:03.335
Tyler, stop yelling.

09:03.418 --> 09:04.503
Sorry.

09:05.003 --> 09:08.966
So, like, what do you think of this place?
I think it's a pretty sick spot.

09:09.049 --> 09:14.471
You plus garbage disposal?
I mean, it's fucking luxe.

09:15.222 --> 09:20.519
I don't know if it's a good time for this.
I get a bad feeling.

09:20.602 --> 09:21.812
I get a rad feeling too.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.397
I can see us here.

09:25.023 --> 09:28.277
I-- I said bad feeling, Tyler.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.904
Bad as in opposite of rad.

09:30.988 --> 09:35.325
Like she's using us,
and she'll leave us behind.

09:35.409 --> 09:37.327
She won't come through
on anything she promised--

09:38.871 --> 09:42.291
Baby! No, no, no, no.
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.168
Tyler? Oh, shit. Babe.

09:44.793 --> 09:45.961
Someone?

09:46.044 --> 09:48.422
God, someone call a fucking ambulance,
please!

09:48.505 --> 09:49.506
Shh, baby.

09:50.799 --> 09:53.177
-Just if he has time.
-Yeah. He'll have time.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.722
You know,
he could look for some loopholes.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.390
No, Ernie looks at contracts for fun.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.309
He'll tell you whether you get
a good deal or not.

10:00.392 --> 10:01.393
Thank you. Than--

10:01.476 --> 10:03.145
That means a lot.
This is good. Here's good.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.396
So--

10:04.897 --> 10:08.984
Hey, should Ernie be mentioning
this contract to Danny or shouldn't he?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.111
Not yet.

10:12.446 --> 10:13.739
Did you tell Danny about it?

10:13.822 --> 10:14.823
I will.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.660
Sheil, I support you. You know I do.

10:18.744 --> 10:21.163
But how exactly is this supposed to work?

10:21.246 --> 10:23.332
Well, you know, if Danny wins,

10:23.415 --> 10:26.168
then he's gonna be spending
most of his time in Sacramento

10:26.251 --> 10:28.545
while I can focus on my business
down here.

10:29.046 --> 10:33.050
He'll be doing his own thing up there
while I'm doing my own thing down here.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.637
Yeah, but what kind of marriage is that?

10:37.221 --> 10:38.222
A happy one.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.807
But that means Danny has to win.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.524
Okay, so yeah, that's the last of 'em.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.485
You wanna head back to HQ
and grab some more? Sheila?

10:51.568 --> 10:55.447
Sheila! Sheila!
We aren't allowed to do that, are we?

10:56.073 --> 10:57.616
-What-- Oh, Jesus.
-Go, go, go!

10:57.699 --> 10:58.992
-Close the door!
-Go, go, go!

10:59.076 --> 11:00.410
-Drive, drive!
-Sheila. Oh, my God!

11:06.208 --> 11:07.584
Ma'am, absolutely not.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.796
What's the latest?

11:10.879 --> 11:14.174
Well, we completed surgery.
He's stable. He's resting now.

11:14.258 --> 11:17.094
The seizure was the result
of an infection in his ear canal

11:17.177 --> 11:19.596
caused by water
trapped behind severe exostosis,

11:19.680 --> 11:21.431
-which is a condition--
-I know what it is.

11:21.515 --> 11:24.226
Well, he's fortunate that the infection
didn't spread to his brain.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.979
Okay, we're gonna need to monitor him
for at least two nights minimum.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.815
That's not gonna work for us.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.442
We need to get out of here,
like, much sooner.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.069
Like pronto.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.445
He just had invasive surgery.

11:35.946 --> 11:38.907
So whatever plans you have,
you're gonna have to cancel them, okay?

11:38.991 --> 11:42.202
Fuck that.
You're not scamming us, Dr. No-Nuts.

11:45.914 --> 11:50.502
I'm sorry. We don't have
the whole insurance thing totally covered.

11:51.086 --> 11:53.881
Then someone from accounting
can talk to you about a payment plan.

12:01.805 --> 12:04.057
He's been cast aside.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.976
He's been underestimated.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.938
He's been viciously attacked
by the opposition.

12:10.022 --> 12:15.068
He's been called a fringe voice,
an outdated hippy.

12:15.611 --> 12:20.824
A dangerous un-American communist
who's after your values,

12:20.908 --> 12:22.326
your wallet, your daughters.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.998
But the truth of what's in his heart,

12:28.081 --> 12:29.958
I don't have to tell you guys that…

12:31.293 --> 12:32.294
but I will.

12:34.171 --> 12:39.218
This man, this giant among men,

12:39.301 --> 12:43.680
he's not just out to save
the sorry soul of this community…

12:44.181 --> 12:46.433
Well, brother, you've already saved mine.

12:46.517 --> 12:50.354
You've made me believe in
this cockamamie process again.

12:50.979 --> 12:54.691
That some good could come out of this.

12:56.527 --> 12:58.070
I mean, look at me, man.

12:58.153 --> 13:02.032
I came up here to say thank you
to all of you for being here,

13:02.115 --> 13:04.660
and I'm crying like a little bitch.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.412
Jerry, you mind if I say a few words?

13:07.496 --> 13:10.415
Would you get up here
and give me an off-ramp, please?

13:12.042 --> 13:13.377
Danny Rubin, everyone!

13:19.466 --> 13:20.467
You guys,

13:20.551 --> 13:24.346
I just gotta say this is fucking amazing

13:24.429 --> 13:27.474
to be here on the verge with all of you.

13:27.558 --> 13:31.562
And my friend who arrived
like the goddamn cavalry

13:31.645 --> 13:35.774
with his spirit and his strategy
to put us well over the top.

13:36.275 --> 13:37.776
Hi-yo, Silver, brother.

13:37.860 --> 13:41.113
And my wife, Sheila. You wanna come up?

13:41.905 --> 13:42.906
Sheila!

13:47.119 --> 13:48.662
This beautiful woman,

13:48.745 --> 13:53.333
who I am certain you would all agree
is much too good for me.

13:53.417 --> 13:54.418
Well…

13:54.501 --> 13:58.547
Her belief in me from the very beginning
is what started all of this.

13:59.923 --> 14:03.677
So from the bottom of my heart,
babe, thank you.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.639
Hear, hear. Yay.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.517
Okay. All right.

14:10.601 --> 14:13.395
Enough sappy stuff. We have got
the turnout to mobilize, all right?

14:13.478 --> 14:15.606
We are up against a serious foe today.

14:16.565 --> 14:19.985
Big, beautiful glossy waves
with a perfect offshore breeze.

14:21.737 --> 14:23.947
So we do have our work cut out for us,
all right?

14:24.031 --> 14:25.532
Come and see me for your assignments.

14:25.616 --> 14:28.452
And remember,
when it comes to local elections,

14:28.535 --> 14:32.206
there's really only one
tried and true American motto:

14:32.289 --> 14:34.291
Nobody cares.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.211
Well, let's turn that around today.

14:37.294 --> 14:38.420
Let's get out the votes!

14:38.504 --> 14:39.922
-Yeah!
-Yeah. Yeah.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.465
Are you worried, dear?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.842
About winning the election? No. Why?

14:43.926 --> 14:46.929
I just wasn't expecting you to call
in the middle of everything.

14:47.554 --> 14:53.060
I just wanted to say hello before I join
my brethren in the poll effort.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.561
-How are you?
-Just fine.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.397
Anything in particular
you'd like for dinner tonight?

14:57.481 --> 14:58.649
I thought prime rib.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.943
I have a taste for red meat
all of a sudden.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.154
Sounds fine.
Just make sure it reheats well.

15:04.238 --> 15:05.656
It could be a long night.

15:05.739 --> 15:09.034
Maybe because I took a test this morning
and it appears that I'm pregnant.

15:11.537 --> 15:13.205
Where's the after-party being held?

15:17.668 --> 15:19.044
The Thoroughbred Club.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.129
Well, have a nice time.

15:21.213 --> 15:22.965
And when you come home,
try not to wake me.

15:33.350 --> 15:36.270
Check out that line, man.

15:36.353 --> 15:39.690
Those are our people. No Schmidt-heads.

15:41.567 --> 15:42.609
How can you tell?

15:43.986 --> 15:46.530
You gotta check the footwear, Sheil.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.240
Not a boat shoe in sight.

15:48.323 --> 15:51.159
Not to mention the distinct absence
of cummerbunds.

15:52.661 --> 15:54.454
This moment feels historic.

15:54.538 --> 15:58.792
Like we planted it together in the past
so it could come true in the present.

15:58.876 --> 16:00.460
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah, man.

16:00.544 --> 16:01.879
I do, actually.

16:04.756 --> 16:08.177
I meant what I said, you know?
About your faith in me.

16:08.260 --> 16:09.928
None of this would be happening
without you.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.848
No. That's good of you to say,
but it's not the case.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.267
-Yeah, it's true. It is true.
-You're the--

16:15.350 --> 16:17.644
You had the vision. You were the spark.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.982
-And you, you were the gas.
-Guys.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.650
-You know it, bud.
-Guys!

16:31.825 --> 16:34.453
Okay, so the Mormons rented a bus.

16:34.536 --> 16:35.954
So the fuck what?

16:36.788 --> 16:40.667
It's just intimidation tactics,
you know? Sound and fury.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.881
I mean, how many of them are there?

16:47.174 --> 16:48.759
They don't believe in birth control.

16:54.681 --> 16:55.974
This fucking guy.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.704
There she is.
You have been here all night.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.790
I'm helping.
There's a lot of mouths to feed.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.252
Yeah, you're hiding. I get it.
I wish I could hide too,

17:23.335 --> 17:26.171
but everybody's watching me,
so it's not really an option.

17:27.256 --> 17:28.549
God, I don't even fucking want this.

17:28.632 --> 17:30.300
I just want the fucking results. Jesus.

17:30.384 --> 17:32.970
-Honey, you're making a mess.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.639
Excuse me for eating something.
You should try it some time.

17:36.807 --> 17:38.016
-Don't do that.
-Hey.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.019
Hey, I need you.
Stop walking away from me.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.939
What? I'm just wiping my hands. What?

17:44.022 --> 17:45.023
Eat this.

17:45.691 --> 17:46.692
-No.
-Yes.

17:46.775 --> 17:49.069
Indulge yourself for once in your life.
You can do it for me.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.029
-I've already had one. I'm good.
-Yeah, bullshit.

17:52.531 --> 17:53.699
Simone had it right.

17:54.408 --> 17:57.452
-Simone? What did she have right?
-All the working out that you're doing.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.454
I mean, who's it for, huh?

18:00.622 --> 18:03.375
Are you trying to build up the strength
so you can leave me when I lose?

18:03.458 --> 18:05.335
-This is a very stressful night for you.
-Yeah.

18:05.419 --> 18:07.546
Maybe the most stressful night
of your life.

18:07.629 --> 18:08.881
I understand.

18:10.048 --> 18:13.427
Babe, everything is gonna be…

18:15.470 --> 18:16.471
-It's--
-What?

18:16.972 --> 18:19.683
Whatever happens, we'll be all right.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.018
Yeah? What if I lose?

18:22.477 --> 18:24.438
Are you gonna see me
the same way after that?

18:24.521 --> 18:25.522
You're not gonna lose.

18:26.273 --> 18:27.274
So you won't then?

18:27.858 --> 18:29.526
No. Yes. I mean, it won't matter.

18:29.610 --> 18:32.738
-Then eat the fucking cream puff.
-No.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.281
-Yes.
-No.

18:37.451 --> 18:40.662
I'm so sorry, Sheila.
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

18:40.746 --> 18:42.789
You have to forgive me.
I don't know why I did that.

18:42.873 --> 18:44.291
I'm a horrible person.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.919
-It's okay. It's okay.
-What if it's not okay?

18:47.002 --> 18:48.795
-What if it's never okay, Sheila?
-It's okay.

18:48.879 --> 18:50.589
It's okay. It's okay.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.842
-Let me say her name.
-No.

18:53.926 --> 18:56.220
Back the fuck off
or I'll dropkick you in the nuts!

18:56.303 --> 18:58.222
Hey, Sheila, we got an issue here!

18:58.305 --> 19:00.349
-Don't you touch me, you monster.
-Yeah.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.851
She's my friend. It's okay.
She's my friend. Just go away.

19:02.935 --> 19:04.394
For the record, I did not touch her.

19:04.478 --> 19:05.479
-Okay.
-She touched me.

19:05.562 --> 19:06.897
-Can we talk outside?
-We need to--

19:06.980 --> 19:08.315
-We need to talk right now…
-Yes.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.067
-Outside.
-…because right now you wanna see…

19:10.150 --> 19:13.612
-This is not a good time.
-That fucking asshole is toying with the--

19:16.532 --> 19:17.533
Oh, my God.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.493
What happened to Tyler?

19:20.494 --> 19:23.080
I had a weird night. Somebody punched me.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.999
He had surgery. We need to know
what your plans are for the future

19:26.083 --> 19:28.585
because we have some serious
financial realities we're facing.

19:28.669 --> 19:30.045
And if you're just gonna bail on us

19:30.128 --> 19:31.630
like everybody else, then we're gonna--

19:31.713 --> 19:34.049
I need to lie down. Maybe a sandwich.

19:34.925 --> 19:36.426
It's election night.

19:36.510 --> 19:38.470
And the results are coming in any minute.

19:38.554 --> 19:40.055
I have a house full of guests.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.348
We don't have a house.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.141
We almost had an apartment.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.978
Now we just have a really expensive hole
in Tyler's head.

19:46.061 --> 19:49.022
And from what we read in the paper,
it seems like you're gonna take off

19:49.106 --> 19:51.817
on some rocket ship to money town
and leave our asses behind.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.193
That is not who I am.

19:53.277 --> 19:55.404
Liar. She has you pegged.

19:57.281 --> 20:01.910
I know that the world can seem like
a cruel and selfish place sometimes,

20:01.994 --> 20:04.788
but not everybody is like that.

20:04.872 --> 20:07.457
Some people have different values,
like kindness.

20:07.541 --> 20:11.295
You lying sack of shit.
She sees who you are.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.463
She always has. She knows.

20:13.964 --> 20:15.549
All right, everybody. It's time.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.552
I'm sorry. I have to go in. I'm sorry.

20:42.910 --> 20:45.954
Those are the winners right there.

20:47.581 --> 20:53.003
And these are the losers.
Can't even pull off a local election.

20:54.755 --> 20:56.840
This is what you've tied yourself to.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.092
Old ideas.

20:59.968 --> 21:02.262
Unpopular. Unwanted.

21:03.388 --> 21:04.389
Tired.

21:06.975 --> 21:09.853
Big fat losers.

21:11.939 --> 21:15.442
That's you, right here, right now.

21:15.984 --> 21:18.195
Weighed down. Sunk.

21:19.196 --> 21:20.197
Done.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.457
Just give up. Just get it over with.

21:30.541 --> 21:34.169
You fat fucking loser.
You're sunk down. Done.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.256
Oh, crap. Sorry! One second!
Give us a minute!

21:37.339 --> 21:39.550
You don't have a minute.
You're about to explode.

21:39.633 --> 21:42.761
You understand that? You will explode.

21:42.845 --> 21:46.306
-Ten, nine, eight, seven, six--
-Yeah, go. Go, go, go.

21:46.390 --> 21:48.225
-Hi. Hey there.
-Hey. Hi. Hi.

21:49.268 --> 21:50.686
-Hey.
-Hi.

21:50.769 --> 21:55.107
Greta-- Greta, showed me your contract.

21:55.190 --> 21:56.441
Mm-hmm.

21:56.525 --> 21:58.777
-And, yeah, looks good. Yeah.
-It looks good.

21:58.861 --> 22:02.990
Happy to go over it with you
some other time.

22:03.073 --> 22:05.701
Yeah. It looks good
in my opinion, yeah. Okay.

22:06.827 --> 22:07.828
That's fine.

22:08.579 --> 22:09.788
I'm so sorry.

22:09.872 --> 22:12.666
The tension just got us so,
like, you know.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.169
So did the results come in? Did we win?

22:16.837 --> 22:17.838
Oh, Sheila.

22:19.965 --> 22:21.300
I'm so sorry.

22:22.134 --> 22:25.596
You're the sorry one. Stuck and sorry.

22:27.431 --> 22:29.349
You feeling bad, hon?

22:29.433 --> 22:31.268
Go stick a cream puff up your ass.

22:36.690 --> 22:38.692
Maybe if he'd won, it would be different.

22:38.775 --> 22:41.278
You'd be happy, celebrating.
But he didn't.

22:41.361 --> 22:45.199
He's just a loser.
He's a weak, pathetic loser.

22:45.282 --> 22:47.242
Oh, God. Is that--

22:48.994 --> 22:50.204
Oh, God.

23:14.102 --> 23:17.064
Well, at least I have my wife by my side.

23:17.147 --> 23:18.690
Oh, that's right. No, I don't.

23:18.774 --> 23:21.068
Because she bailed
and left me alone again.

23:21.151 --> 23:24.112
She's like the rest
of this goddamn country, man.

23:24.821 --> 23:27.407
I'm sorry.
I wanted this to be celebration coke.

23:28.450 --> 23:29.993
Consolation works too.

23:30.077 --> 23:32.371
I don't know
if I'd wanna hang out with us either.

23:32.454 --> 23:35.499
Oh, Reagan and his goons
are gonna keep winning.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.960
-'Cause nobody wants--
-Nobody wants the truth.

23:38.043 --> 23:40.587
-This world is out of control.
-The world.

23:40.671 --> 23:42.756
-It's terrible. Screwed.
-The earth is screwed.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.091
Are you kidding me? The oceans--

23:44.174 --> 23:45.175
The air! Come on.

23:45.259 --> 23:47.344
We're the only ones
who care about this shit, man.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.012
God, it doesn't matter
that we're good people.

23:49.096 --> 23:51.056
Oh, fuck that. We're great people.

23:51.139 --> 23:53.016
It doesn't matter.
No one cares. We're unpopular.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.643
We're losers. We're unmarketable.

23:54.726 --> 23:57.104
-That's what it fucking comes down to.
-Unmarketable, what is that?

23:57.187 --> 23:59.022
It's doublespeak.
It's what the man created.

23:59.106 --> 24:00.315
-No. No, no, no.
-No?

24:00.399 --> 24:02.192
-We've been thinking about this wrong…
-We're wrong.

24:02.276 --> 24:04.361
-…the entire time.
-This entire time we've been wrong.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.697
We can't work with the system.

24:06.780 --> 24:09.950
-So we have to work outside the system.
-Outside the system.

24:10.033 --> 24:12.494
We need a think tank.

24:30.679 --> 24:35.642
We'll call ourselves
"the Campaign for United Mobilization…"

24:35.726 --> 24:38.395
-"Of the Democratic Movement of…"
-No.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.689
-"Advocacy."
-No. No, "Coalition."

24:40.772 --> 24:43.692
-"The Coalition of the Democratic…"
-Coalition. Democratic.

24:44.776 --> 24:46.236
-Fuck!
-Allegiance? No!

24:46.862 --> 24:47.863
Fuck!

24:47.946 --> 24:49.656
-Why's it so hard to come up with a name?
-I don't know, man.

24:49.740 --> 24:50.741
I can't come up with a name.

24:50.824 --> 24:53.035
-It's gone. Just let it go.
-We'll just--

24:53.118 --> 24:55.454
We'll fucking--
We have so much time. We'll think of it.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.235
-We've been thinking too small.
-Of course we've been thinking too small.

25:26.318 --> 25:28.403
-Too small.
-You're bigger than this town.

25:28.487 --> 25:31.740
-Fuck this town.
-You're bigger than this state.

25:31.823 --> 25:34.117
-Fucking town. This state. The fucking--
-Do you understand?

25:34.201 --> 25:35.536
It's fucking national.

25:35.619 --> 25:38.288
No. No, it's not fucking national.

25:38.372 --> 25:41.500
-It's fucking international, man.
-Jerry.

25:41.583 --> 25:44.628
-Jerry. Fucking international.
-It's fucking international.

26:06.525 --> 26:09.820
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me. Yes!
