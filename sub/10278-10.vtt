E. R.

00:07.536 --> 00:09.366
Previously on E. R.

00:11.739 --> 00:13.677
- A brain tumor.
- It's a GBM.

00:13.696 --> 00:17.279
The speech arrest you were experiencing
was probably the result of a focal seizure.

00:17.280 --> 00:20.723
You'd lose all ability to comprehend,
interact with the world around you.

00:20.824 --> 00:23.234
I had a biopsy

00:23.235 --> 00:26.451
While the tumor's adjacent to Broca's
it hasn't invaded it yet.

00:26.452 --> 00:28.302
We'll do an awake craniotomy.

00:28.537 --> 00:30.313
You'll be conscious and talking...

00:30.334 --> 00:33.669
while I map out Broca's
and resect the tumor.

00:33.940 --> 00:35.668
E. R. 7x10 "PIECE OF MIND"

00:35.841 --> 00:37.880
Don't you pull out, you dumb-ass!

00:38.051 --> 00:41.086
- I asked you a question.
- I just don't wanna play anymore.

00:41.386 --> 00:46.212
Think I've liked waking up at 5:30 a. m.
for 10 years to drive you to a cold arena?

00:46.389 --> 00:48.511
My toes are frozen, my ass is numb.

00:48.682 --> 00:51.682
That damn coffee machine
gives me heartburn all freaking day.

00:52.684 --> 00:55.009
Wake up, Dad.
I'm not gonna make the NHL.

00:55.186 --> 00:56.679
Not with that attitude.

00:57.896 --> 01:01.098
You wanna end up working in a factory
like me and your Uncle Don?

01:01.315 --> 01:03.686
- No.
- Well, you're damn right you don't.

01:03.858 --> 01:05.399
Want a good job, go to college.

01:05.567 --> 01:07.773
To go to college,
you'll need a scholarship.

01:07.943 --> 01:12.236
You're a bright kid, but you won't
get a scholarship with those grades.

01:12.404 --> 01:17.527
Well, maybe my grades would be better
if I wasn't playing hockey all the time.

01:23.870 --> 01:25.577
Dad!

01:27.372 --> 01:29.364
It's okay, keep it.

01:29.748 --> 01:31.657
- Nice tip.
- It's New Year's Eve.

01:31.833 --> 01:34.370
- He's got a long day ahead of him.
- Sounds okay to me.

01:34.543 --> 01:37.626
Drive around Manhattan,
listen to the radio...

01:37.795 --> 01:40.629
...talk to people, no brain surgery.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.124
- Very funny.
- It's weird.

01:42.297 --> 01:45.380
You know, I've sent
a couple thousand people to the O.R.

01:45.549 --> 01:48.632
- And?
- And I've never been myself.

01:48.801 --> 01:51.884
- You're a virgin.
- I still have my appendix, my tonsils.

01:52.053 --> 01:55.503
The only general anesthetic I've
ever gotten was in a dentist's chair.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.672
- It's no different, really.
- Oh, sure.

01:57.848 --> 02:02.140
Pull a tooth, have my skull sawed open,
it's pretty much the same thing.

02:02.309 --> 02:05.843
- I mean the anesthesia.
- Except for the part where they wake me.

02:06.020 --> 02:08.473
At that point,
you'll know things are going well.

02:08.645 --> 02:10.472
Yeah, right.

02:15.901 --> 02:17.892
Are you ready?

02:18.611 --> 02:20.318
Let's do it.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:32.661 --> 02:35.151
Come on,
we gotta get them out of there!

02:40.582 --> 02:44.032
- Cut the battery.
- Shut that off.

02:44.209 --> 02:45.454
No. Take my dad.

02:46.586 --> 02:50.119
- We gotta get you out to get to him.
- All right.

02:50.296 --> 02:53.331
- Blunt head trauma, open tib-fib fracture.
- Dad? Dad, you okay?

02:53.506 --> 02:55.629
- Start a line...
- I don't know. You?

02:56.091 --> 02:59.625
- I think I'm hurt pretty bad.
- Easy.

03:03.262 --> 03:06.013
Paul? Paul!

03:07.765 --> 03:09.757
Paul!

03:13.435 --> 03:15.972
- Paul, you hear me?
- How are you doing, sir?

03:16.187 --> 03:19.021
- What's wrong with my son?
- He's going to the hospital.

03:19.188 --> 03:21.595
- What's your name?
- Dan Harris.

03:21.773 --> 03:25.437
- Can you tell me what day it is?
- December 31.

03:25.609 --> 03:27.103
Good. Let's get a C-collar.

03:27.277 --> 03:28.936
- I need another backboard.
- Paul!

03:29.278 --> 03:31.649
Pupils equal and reactive.
Okay, let's roll him.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.520
E. R.

04:23.002 --> 04:25.575
- Did you pass out?
- I don't know. It happened so fast.

04:25.754 --> 04:29.088
- Are in you in pain?
- That air bag gave my chest a good shot.

04:29.258 --> 04:31.830
- Another two of morphine.
- You're doing a ride-along.

04:32.093 --> 04:35.010
Yeah. Residency requirement.
I've been putting it off.

04:35.346 --> 04:38.015
- I thought you'd make a good paramedic.
- That's funny.

04:38.182 --> 04:41.017
Dan Harris, auto versus garbage truck.
Restrained passenger...

04:41.184 --> 04:43.674
...air bags deployed.
I cleared his neck on the ride.

04:43.853 --> 04:46.474
My son, Paul Harris,
did they bring him here?

04:46.647 --> 04:48.722
Yeah, I think so. We'll find out.

04:48.898 --> 04:51.816
- Are you taking any medications?
- No.

04:51.984 --> 04:53.776
- You got any drug allergies?
- No.

04:53.945 --> 04:56.861
- This the other MVA?
- Yeah, 46-year-old male.

04:57.031 --> 05:00.446
- Any past surgeries?
- Appendix, as a kid. Where's Paul?

05:00.617 --> 05:02.656
- That's his son.
- Weaver's got him in 2.

05:02.827 --> 05:04.487
Who's Weaver?

05:04.662 --> 05:07.413
- End of the line, Mr. Harris. Good luck.
- You're leaving?

05:07.581 --> 05:10.866
- Yeah. Gotta save some more lives.
- One, two, three.

05:11.168 --> 05:13.456
Let's get a 12-lead
and cut these clothes off.

05:13.628 --> 05:16.498
All right, C-spine, chest and pelvis,
trauma panel and a UA.

05:16.797 --> 05:18.873
BP 130/92, pulse 116.

05:19.049 --> 05:21.801
My wife just bought those pants.

05:21.969 --> 05:24.293
Have you ever been
in this hospital before?

05:24.470 --> 05:27.305
No, I haven't been in a hospital
since my son was born.

05:27.473 --> 05:31.007
- Give me 20 cc's of 1 % lido with bicarb.
- That's cold!

05:31.184 --> 05:33.640
Who's your family doctor?

05:36.188 --> 05:39.522
Klizowski at the Morgan Family Clinic.
What are you doing?

05:39.692 --> 05:42.361
Putting a tube in your chest
to reinflate your lung.

05:42.528 --> 05:45.481
- I got a collapsed lung?
- It happens with your type of injury.

05:45.655 --> 05:48.774
- But you'll breathe easier once it's in.
- Thora-Seal's ready.

05:49.117 --> 05:52.117
- Is there anyone we can notify?
- My wife, Debra.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.195
-28 French.
- Do you have the number?

05:54.871 --> 05:57.706
I can't remember.
I got it on speed dial.

05:57.874 --> 06:00.660
She teaches
at Our Lady of Perpetual Hope.

06:00.835 --> 06:02.993
- Let's culture the bone.
- Got an extra Foley kit?

06:03.170 --> 06:05.127
- Gram of Ancef and 100 of gent.
- Paul!

06:05.297 --> 06:07.336
- Give me a large Kelly.
- Paul!

06:07.507 --> 06:10.212
- Dad, is that you?
- Can you...?

06:10.385 --> 06:12.376
Can you open that door?
I need to see him.

06:15.389 --> 06:17.298
- What are you doing?
- This is the father.

06:17.474 --> 06:21.008
- I'm right here, son.
- Irrigation saline, sterile four-by-fours.

06:21.186 --> 06:22.976
- Dad?
- Yeah.

06:23.145 --> 06:27.438
- They stuck a freaking tube in my chest.
- I'm in. Hook me up to low suction.

06:27.607 --> 06:29.315
I'm okay, though.

06:29.526 --> 06:33.191
Hey, you know, your mom's gonna be
really pissed off about her truck.

06:33.363 --> 06:35.236
I'll tell her you were driving, okay?

06:35.489 --> 06:38.158
Hey, Cleo.
Need some Xeroform over here.

06:38.325 --> 06:40.649
Paul? Don't be scared, Paul.

06:40.827 --> 06:46.034
- I'm not.
- Be strong, now! Be strong.

06:48.333 --> 06:52.033
- He's gonna be okay, right?
- Looks like a tough kid.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.880
Yeah. Yes, he is.

07:03.721 --> 07:05.630
Are you finished?

07:06.057 --> 07:09.721
Yeah. I just need you to sign this.

07:13.563 --> 07:17.809
- It's a power of attorney.
- Something goes wrong-

07:17.983 --> 07:20.520
Something goes wrong, what?

07:22.070 --> 07:24.109
No heroic measures.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.818
No ventilators, no feeding tubes...

07:26.991 --> 07:30.609
...if there's no hope
of meaningful recovery.

07:30.786 --> 07:35.079
- You're going to be fine, Mark.
- Elizabeth, you're a surgeon.

07:35.248 --> 07:39.459
- You know that-
- That you're going to be fine.

07:40.460 --> 07:44.208
- You don't want the responsibility?
- It's unnecessary.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.713
I don't want to end up like that.

07:52.262 --> 07:54.054
Now you're being dramatic.

07:55.390 --> 08:00.098
So if I end up
in a persistent vegetative state-

08:00.812 --> 08:02.768
Fine.

08:02.938 --> 08:05.725
Fine. Give it to me.

08:11.612 --> 08:14.447
- What's in the Thora-Seal?
- Minimal blood loss.

08:14.615 --> 08:16.073
Oh, good. No hemothorax.

08:16.241 --> 08:20.154
Mr. Harris? I need you to sign this
consent for treatment for your son.

08:20.327 --> 08:21.739
- Where is he?
- Radiology.

08:21.913 --> 08:22.943
What's he doing there?

08:23.122 --> 08:26.122
We had to get x-rays of his leg.
He'll probably need surgery.

08:26.291 --> 08:29.991
- Can't you just put a cast on it?
- The bone penetrated the skin.

08:30.170 --> 08:34.629
But there's no joints involved, and it's
midshaft, so it'll probably heal nicely.

08:34.798 --> 08:36.957
Mr. Harris, I gotta take you
for a head CT.

08:37.134 --> 08:40.253
- What's that?
- Head CT? CAT scan.

08:40.428 --> 08:44.425
It's pretty standard after you hit
your head and lose consciousness.

08:44.599 --> 08:46.140
- Did you tell her yet?
- Who?

08:46.308 --> 08:49.759
- Weaver.
- Oh, no, not yet.

08:49.936 --> 08:53.270
But it's part of
my New Year's resolution.

08:53.940 --> 08:56.145
No, really. It is.

09:02.614 --> 09:03.858
You okay?

09:04.031 --> 09:06.736
- Am I bleeding?
- No.

09:06.909 --> 09:08.902
I'm fine.

09:11.162 --> 09:15.076
- Did you call the furnace guy?
- Yep. Last week.

09:15.249 --> 09:18.369
Is he coming over?
You don't want the pipes to freeze.

09:18.544 --> 09:19.824
Larry let him in.

09:20.003 --> 09:24.831
- Who's Larry?
- Larry Corbin, the neighbor.

09:25.008 --> 09:29.468
- In the blue house?
- No, in the brown, actually.

09:30.220 --> 09:32.129
I'm sorry.

09:33.348 --> 09:37.392
No, no. It's my fault. Oh, damn.

09:37.977 --> 09:40.385
You're gonna have
to put on scrubs anyway.

09:40.563 --> 09:43.432
- Scrubs?
- You were planning on coming in?

09:45.692 --> 09:50.851
- Don't you think Burke might object?
- You're probably right.

09:51.029 --> 09:53.402
It's gonna be pretty crowded in there.

09:59.620 --> 10:01.529
Mark, do you want me to come in?

10:01.705 --> 10:05.619
No, I'll be fine.
You go get cleaned up.

10:06.209 --> 10:07.833
I can finish this.

10:11.713 --> 10:14.750
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

10:39.237 --> 10:41.644
I've never been
so claustrophobic before.

10:41.823 --> 10:44.230
- Happens to many people.
- Is everything all right?

10:44.409 --> 10:47.776
Looks good, but a radiologist has
to review the films.

10:47.952 --> 10:50.159
- Can I sit up?
- Sure.

10:50.330 --> 10:53.580
Let me know if you get lightheaded.

10:53.749 --> 10:56.916
We contacted the school.
They're trying to reach Debra.

10:57.086 --> 11:00.953
God, I hope she doesn't get
in a car accident rushing over here.

11:01.131 --> 11:03.288
Hey, can we see Paul
before his operation?

11:03.466 --> 11:06.881
That depends on when the orthopedic
surgeon can schedule the surgery.

11:07.094 --> 11:09.964
- It's just his leg, right?
- No, he had a head trauma.

11:10.513 --> 11:14.214
- Trauma? What do you mean trauma?
- He hit his head just like you did.

11:14.392 --> 11:17.013
He's stable now,
but we observe head injuries carefully.

11:17.186 --> 11:20.270
- You mean he could be unstable?
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

11:20.439 --> 11:22.894
Oh, God, she's gonna think
it's my fault again.

11:23.066 --> 11:24.608
What?

11:26.902 --> 11:32.109
Our first son died of SIDS.
He'd be about 20 now.

11:33.533 --> 11:35.157
I'm sorry.

11:36.703 --> 11:39.489
Yeah, he was 3 weeks old.

11:40.498 --> 11:43.700
I sent my wife out, you know,
to get some rest...

11:43.875 --> 11:46.448
...you know,
for herself for a couple hours.

11:46.627 --> 11:50.078
The baby had been up all night,
finally fell asleep.

11:50.256 --> 11:52.877
I must have dozed off myself.

11:54.092 --> 11:57.591
Because I didn't wake
until I heard her scream.

11:57.929 --> 12:01.973
She had come home
to find Nathan had died in his crib.

12:04.143 --> 12:09.931
I mean, we didn't have baby monitors
and stuff like you do nowadays.

12:10.106 --> 12:15.265
I mean, she didn't blame me.
But I know...

12:15.443 --> 12:18.610
I know that she thought
if she'd stayed home that night...

12:18.780 --> 12:20.903
...he'd still be alive.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.742
There's no way you could have known.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.986
Stick out your tongue.

12:26.870 --> 12:28.909
Show me your teeth.

12:29.330 --> 12:32.367
Repeat after me:
Ready to rock 'n' roll.

12:32.542 --> 12:37.416
- "Ready to rock 'n' roll. "
- And that we are.

12:38.254 --> 12:43.081
So you know the procedure,
you've had your meds.

12:43.258 --> 12:46.544
- Anything on your mind?
- That's why I'm here.

12:48.222 --> 12:52.171
You won't see me in there,
but I'll be talking to you.

12:53.351 --> 12:58.261
- Good luck.
- We don't need it, but thank you, Mark.

13:20.457 --> 13:23.078
So, what are you here for?

13:24.294 --> 13:26.167
I'm Leo.

13:30.048 --> 13:33.049
I'm Mark. What are you here for?

13:33.218 --> 13:36.633
I've got something growing on my heart.
I'm not sure how to say it.

13:36.804 --> 13:39.377
- Myxoma?
- No, but it sounds like that.

13:39.807 --> 13:42.214
- Teratoma?
- How did you know?

13:42.392 --> 13:44.965
- I'm a doctor.
- Yeah, right.

13:45.145 --> 13:48.181
Doctors get sick too, you know.

13:49.023 --> 13:53.102
- I got something growing on my brain.
- What do they do for that?

13:53.277 --> 13:57.605
Same as you. Operate, take it out.

13:57.989 --> 14:00.693
Does it hurt?
They told me it wouldn't hurt.

14:00.866 --> 14:03.403
You'll be asleep the whole time.

14:03.576 --> 14:08.950
And when you wake up, if you're sore,
they'll give you medicine.

14:10.958 --> 14:14.575
- This sucks.
- It'll be over before you know it.

14:15.170 --> 14:17.661
It still sucks.

14:20.258 --> 14:22.049
Yeah.

14:26.137 --> 14:27.715
Yeah.

14:29.891 --> 14:31.349
Is Trauma 1 still open?

14:31.517 --> 14:35.466
Not for long. Blast injury to face
coming in. A guy testing Roman candles.

14:35.645 --> 14:38.397
I have to park you until I find
you a room. I'll be back.

14:38.565 --> 14:40.059
Thanks.

14:42.193 --> 14:45.146
No, I've been waiting three hours.

15:02.668 --> 15:05.622
- Happy New Year.
- Okay, Gordy. Back to bed.

15:05.796 --> 15:08.501
Hey, Randi. Randi,
get Blue Beacon on the phone.

15:08.674 --> 15:12.837
They cannot deny authorization
for a retinal-artery occlusion.

15:13.011 --> 15:15.584
- Excuse me?
- I got a page for a surgical consult.

15:15.763 --> 15:18.846
A guy in Curtain 2 has
a beeper up his rectum.

15:19.015 --> 15:20.807
- What?
- Has it on vibrate.

15:20.976 --> 15:23.513
- Can't figure out how he slipped it in.
- Ma'am?

15:23.687 --> 15:26.603
Never underestimate the elasticity
of the anal sphincter.

15:26.772 --> 15:28.017
Excuse me, excuse me.

15:28.190 --> 15:31.808
You're the doctor who's taking care
of my son, Paul Harris.

15:31.985 --> 15:34.938
- The car accident?
- Yes. Is he...? Is he all right?

15:35.112 --> 15:37.438
They've arranged
to send him up to the O.R.

15:37.615 --> 15:40.651
- We need you now. Sats are dropping.
- To what?

15:40.826 --> 15:42.699
- Seventy-four.
- He was getting sleepy.

15:43.244 --> 15:46.079
- But now we can't wake him.
- Heart rate down to 50.

15:46.247 --> 15:47.658
- Paul!
- You want atropine?

15:47.832 --> 15:50.998
- Push a milligram. Rapid induction.
- Paul!

15:51.167 --> 15:53.244
- Number 8 ET tube.
- Paul!

15:53.420 --> 15:55.163
Let's go.

15:57.131 --> 16:00.381
BP's 90/60. Bag him on 100 percent.

16:00.551 --> 16:03.123
- Call for a vent.
- Cricoid pressure.

16:04.054 --> 16:07.173
- I'm in. Bag him.
- Paul!

16:08.433 --> 16:12.300
Do you hear me? Be strong, Paul!
Don't quit!

16:16.940 --> 16:21.151
- Hey, Mr. Harris. Feeling any better?
- No.

16:21.318 --> 16:24.023
- You got a collapsed lung.
- Blood bank's low.

16:24.196 --> 16:26.982
Weaver wants everybody to donate
before their shift's over.

16:27.156 --> 16:29.196
- I always do.
- That's very generous of you.

16:29.367 --> 16:33.281
That, and I get drunk for half as much
when I'm down a pint. Take it easy.

16:34.121 --> 16:36.659
Good news.
Mr. Harris, your CT looks normal.

16:36.832 --> 16:40.165
I know, but this tube you stuck
in my chest is killing me.

16:40.335 --> 16:43.251
Abby, give Mr. Harris here
another 5 of morphine.

16:43.421 --> 16:46.421
We're gonna admit you
and monitor you for a day or two.

16:46.590 --> 16:48.915
- And then we'll take that tube out.
- Okay.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.464
Listen, did you
find out anything at all?

16:51.636 --> 16:54.838
His oxygen level was low for a while.
We're not sure why.

16:55.013 --> 16:56.342
- Is that your son?
- Yes.

16:56.515 --> 17:00.263
- What are his sats?
-100% after intubation. GCS is 10.

17:00.810 --> 17:04.676
- What's that mean?
- It could be a bruise to the brain.

17:04.855 --> 17:07.143
We won't know for sure
until after the scan.

17:07.315 --> 17:09.604
- When is that?
- Any minute now.

17:09.776 --> 17:11.568
Mr. Harris?

17:11.987 --> 17:15.189
- Yes?
- I'm Officer Darcy. How you doing?

17:15.698 --> 17:16.978
Well, I've been better.

17:18.200 --> 17:22.196
I have to write an accident report.
Can you tell me what happened?

17:22.369 --> 17:23.994
Well, I...

17:24.747 --> 17:28.163
You know, I honestly don't remember.

17:29.001 --> 17:32.619
One minute, I'm driving the car
with my son.

17:32.796 --> 17:38.667
And then the next minute,
the paramedics are just dragging me out.

17:39.176 --> 17:43.007
- That guy came out of nowhere.
- You failed to stop for the red light.

17:43.179 --> 17:45.385
I would never do that.

17:45.556 --> 17:50.182
- No, it wasn't my fault.
- Several witnesses say it was.

18:06.032 --> 18:09.401
I guess it's too late
to change my mind now.

18:10.452 --> 18:13.121
- Would you?
- No.

18:14.122 --> 18:18.783
They took that kid in for a teratoma
resection while you were gone.

18:18.959 --> 18:21.450
He was pretty freaked out.

18:28.385 --> 18:30.839
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

18:35.224 --> 18:36.718
Okay, time to go.

18:45.232 --> 18:50.023
- Okay, you need help?
- Nope, I've got it.

19:03.248 --> 19:07.327
- You gonna go see a movie?
- I'll be right outside.

19:07.501 --> 19:11.581
Hey, your hands are like ice.
Do you want a blanket?

19:11.838 --> 19:14.044
Mark? Mark, are you okay?

19:14.215 --> 19:16.752
- If I don't make it through-
- Don't talk like that.

19:16.925 --> 19:21.053
If I don't make it,
I left you the life insurance.

19:21.221 --> 19:24.554
It'll pay for the house,
for you and the baby.

19:24.724 --> 19:27.808
I'm sorry, Mark.
I can't go through here.

19:29.102 --> 19:32.685
- I love you, Elizabeth.
- I love you too.

19:33.606 --> 19:37.105
You're going to be okay,
and I'll see you very, very soon.

19:52.789 --> 19:56.621
Okay, Mr. Greene,
I'm gonna lower your head now.

20:00.004 --> 20:04.332
- Jesús, this is my last guy. You done?
- No, man. I gotta pull a double.

20:04.508 --> 20:06.250
Happy-freaking-New Year, huh?

20:06.425 --> 20:08.465
Tell me about it.

20:25.817 --> 20:28.486
- All this for me?
- Yep.

20:33.115 --> 20:35.985
Slide on over to the table for us.

20:40.371 --> 20:44.831
Okay, Mark. I'm Dr. Hammond,
your anesthesiologist.

20:45.917 --> 20:50.875
You'll be looking at me and talking
to me throughout the surgery. Okay?

20:51.297 --> 20:52.328
Okay.

20:52.506 --> 20:55.377
For the burr hole,
I'll need a Midas Rex with an M-8 bit.

20:55.551 --> 20:58.255
Then I'll switch to a V-1
for the bone flap.

21:01.014 --> 21:03.339
Excuse me, Dr. Burke?

21:05.559 --> 21:09.473
You said you'd give me a little
something to take the edge off.

21:10.146 --> 21:12.222
Excuse me, Dr. Burke?

21:13.024 --> 21:17.270
- So, what? It's a coma?
- It's not what you think of as a coma.

21:17.444 --> 21:20.149
He's having what we call
"purposeful movements. "

21:20.322 --> 21:25.481
And the CAT scan shows there's no sign
of hemorrhage or skull fractures.

21:27.245 --> 21:31.740
You know, he's unconscious,
but if you'd like to talk to him...

21:31.915 --> 21:35.200
...I'm pretty sure
he'll be able to hear you.

21:40.881 --> 21:42.838
Hey, son.

21:45.051 --> 21:47.756
It's time to wake up now.

21:47.929 --> 21:50.216
You ready to go home?

21:51.682 --> 21:53.757
Well, you gotta open your eyes.

22:00.064 --> 22:02.934
Every day, I used to do this
to get him up for school.

22:03.108 --> 22:06.892
Sometimes he'd fake it
until I tickled him.

22:12.032 --> 22:13.775
Son...

22:15.660 --> 22:17.818
...be strong now.

22:24.918 --> 22:26.293
Mark? Mark?

22:26.461 --> 22:29.959
Hey, Mark? Mark? Hey, Mark?

22:30.923 --> 22:35.585
- Mark, breathe for me.
- Let's check the lapel line.

22:35.761 --> 22:38.381
- Testing. One, two, three.
- How are you doing there?

22:38.554 --> 22:40.547
- Testing.
- Tell me your name.

22:43.476 --> 22:46.642
- Mark.
- Mark what?

22:47.604 --> 22:50.390
- Mark Greene.
- Hi, Mark.

22:50.564 --> 22:54.312
I'm Dr. Malcolm from Neurology.
How many fingers?

22:54.694 --> 22:57.610
- I can't see.
- He needs his glasses.

22:58.655 --> 23:00.612
Elizabeth?

23:02.074 --> 23:03.948
Elizabeth?

23:05.494 --> 23:08.993
Fingers first, Mark. How many?

23:10.081 --> 23:11.955
Three.

23:12.667 --> 23:14.077
Elizabeth?

23:19.173 --> 23:22.790
- I thought you might like some company.
- Nice hat.

23:23.551 --> 23:26.468
- Thanks.
- All right, Mark.

23:26.637 --> 23:31.382
I'll be doing the language testing
while Dr. Burke maps the brain.

23:31.558 --> 23:33.763
- I have an itch.
- Where?

23:34.728 --> 23:36.470
Behind my knee.

23:36.645 --> 23:39.018
- May I?
- Sure.

23:40.357 --> 23:42.848
- Left or right?
- Left.

23:43.026 --> 23:45.350
Okay, Mark.
Name the months of the year.

23:46.488 --> 23:48.978
January, February...

23:49.156 --> 23:51.991
...March, April-

23:53.493 --> 23:56.659
That's it. A little lower.

23:56.829 --> 24:00.114
May, June, July.

24:06.796 --> 24:10.496
Mr. Harris? Mr. Harris?

24:10.675 --> 24:13.509
Your wife is here.

24:13.676 --> 24:17.175
- Dan?
- Debra.

24:17.722 --> 24:21.172
- What happened?
- We got hit by a garbage truck.

24:21.350 --> 24:22.928
O.R.'s ready.

24:23.102 --> 24:26.850
- No. You said he'd wake up on his own.
- The surgery's for his leg.

24:27.022 --> 24:29.891
We'll take him up to the O.R.
in a minute.

24:32.693 --> 24:36.026
He looks so big just lying here,
doesn't he?

24:36.988 --> 24:40.007
Remember I used to hold him in my hand
and rock him to sleep?

24:40.245 --> 24:41.433
Yeah.

24:41.450 --> 24:45.150
You used to think I was gonna drop him.
Remember that?

24:47.539 --> 24:49.365
Paul.

24:49.707 --> 24:52.162
Debra, I ran a red.

24:52.835 --> 24:56.914
We were arguing about him quitting
hockey, and the music was really loud.

24:57.088 --> 25:00.539
I don't know.
I must have missed the light change.

25:00.716 --> 25:04.927
Honey, it was an accident.
Debra, I'm sorry.

25:05.554 --> 25:07.879
Mr. Harris, you all right?

25:08.056 --> 25:11.389
I think this tube is
getting my chest again.

25:11.559 --> 25:14.430
- We should get you back to bed.
- I wanna stay with my son.

25:14.604 --> 25:18.018
Malik. I think you'd feel more
comfortable if you were lying down.

25:18.189 --> 25:20.858
- No, I wanna stay here! Debra?
- How's your breathing?

25:21.025 --> 25:23.397
- Having any chest pain?
- A little.

25:23.569 --> 25:26.654
- He needs a 12-lead!
- I wanna stay with my son.

25:26.822 --> 25:28.281
- Let's get a BP.
- I'm sorry!

25:28.448 --> 25:31.449
- Nitro spray if his systolic gets over 100.
- So sorry.

25:32.744 --> 25:34.535
Trumpet.

25:34.704 --> 25:36.411
Hammer.

25:37.622 --> 25:39.580
Dolphin.

25:41.459 --> 25:43.535
Guitar.

25:44.170 --> 25:46.162
Tent.

25:47.089 --> 25:49.496
Pachyderm.

25:51.426 --> 25:53.999
Another name for this one?

25:54.179 --> 25:57.428
Elephant.

25:57.598 --> 26:02.260
It's Dr. Burke. You're doing great.
We're mapping out Broca's just fine.

26:02.436 --> 26:03.764
Glad to hear it.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.143
Four milliamps, please.

26:08.983 --> 26:10.394
Catapult.

26:12.277 --> 26:13.605
Thermometer.

26:25.330 --> 26:28.579
- Bulldozer.
- Hesitation on that one.

26:28.749 --> 26:30.292
Got it.

26:32.127 --> 26:33.621
Window.

26:36.923 --> 26:38.417
Hesitation again.

26:41.969 --> 26:44.638
Try to read the card, Mark.

26:48.016 --> 26:51.716
How are you doing there, Mark? Mark?

26:51.894 --> 26:53.850
My...

26:55.022 --> 26:57.014
...thumb.

26:58.525 --> 27:00.932
He's diaphoretic.

27:02.820 --> 27:05.357
I don't... Good.

27:06.824 --> 27:10.027
Elizabeth.

27:10.202 --> 27:11.992
- He's seizing.
- Oh, my God.

27:12.161 --> 27:13.441
Cool saline, please.

27:14.539 --> 27:16.116
Sats are 92.

27:16.290 --> 27:19.374
- What's happening?
- Electronic stimulation-induced seizure.

27:19.543 --> 27:21.949
Dousing the brain
with saline should cool it down.

27:22.128 --> 27:24.037
- You said you'd be home at 5.
- Mark.

27:24.296 --> 27:26.040
- It's now 9:00.
- Give him Ativan.

27:26.215 --> 27:30.164
We can't sedate him, we won't be able
to talk to him. Cancel the surgery.

27:32.470 --> 27:34.510
- Try propafol.
- What else can you do?

27:34.681 --> 27:36.672
Give it a minute.

27:38.309 --> 27:42.140
- Too severe.
- Mark! Mark!

27:42.312 --> 27:43.640
- He's postictal.
- What now?

27:43.813 --> 27:46.518
We can't resect the tumor
until he's awake and alert.

27:46.691 --> 27:48.517
Mark. Mark, it's Elizabeth.

27:48.692 --> 27:52.736
- Wake up.
- Mark, come on home.

27:53.362 --> 27:57.609
Mark, we need you to talk to us.
Mark.

28:02.663 --> 28:06.790
That's a good gag with the scope.
He might be lightening up.

28:07.708 --> 28:09.581
Mark?

28:10.461 --> 28:15.087
Come on, Mark. Come on, buddy.
Try and wake up. Mark!

28:15.924 --> 28:21.047
No response to painful stimuli.
His eyes are open, but he's out of it.

28:21.470 --> 28:23.758
- How long since the seizure?
- Half an hour.

28:23.930 --> 28:26.966
Still no significant change in GCS.

28:27.142 --> 28:30.095
Maybe we should close up
and come back in a few days.

28:30.269 --> 28:32.806
In a few days?
You've just opened his skull.

28:32.979 --> 28:35.268
Hey, what...?

28:35.440 --> 28:37.432
What's going on out there?

28:37.608 --> 28:41.522
You had a seizure during mapping, Mark.
We had to wait.

28:41.695 --> 28:45.360
I'm okay. Keep going.

28:45.532 --> 28:49.611
- You heard the man. Dr. Malcolm?
- Okay, Mark.

28:49.786 --> 28:52.951
Name things that start
with the letter B.

28:55.457 --> 28:57.663
Baseball.

28:58.460 --> 29:00.416
Broccoli.

29:00.795 --> 29:03.167
Brazil.

29:03.631 --> 29:05.919
Bamboo.

29:06.842 --> 29:08.881
Burke.

29:09.052 --> 29:11.175
Brain.

29:11.429 --> 29:13.468
Broca.

29:14.807 --> 29:16.217
You okay?

29:17.642 --> 29:19.469
Fine.

29:19.811 --> 29:23.890
- How are you feeling?
- Okay.

29:24.315 --> 29:25.975
I'm sleepy.

29:26.901 --> 29:28.442
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

29:28.610 --> 29:32.524
Come on now, Mark.
Things that begin with B.

29:35.366 --> 29:36.824
Baby.

29:37.034 --> 29:38.493
Boy.

29:38.661 --> 29:41.863
So you think we're gonna
have a boy, do you?

29:43.706 --> 29:45.746
Just a hunch.

29:46.334 --> 29:49.168
We could find out if you like.

29:50.837 --> 29:52.664
Let's...

29:53.005 --> 29:55.496
Let's wait, see.

29:55.675 --> 29:59.542
Then we have to argue
about boy and girl names.

30:00.512 --> 30:03.513
What about Jesús?

30:03.681 --> 30:07.132
Jesús? That's Jesus. Jesus Greene.

30:07.310 --> 30:10.974
I'm sorry, but I need you
to work with me here. More B's.

30:11.188 --> 30:13.014
Okay.

30:15.525 --> 30:17.398
Bobby.

30:17.902 --> 30:19.182
Bill.

30:20.571 --> 30:22.528
Bradley.

30:24.532 --> 30:26.276
Bubba.

30:27.952 --> 30:29.150
Any more pain?

30:29.328 --> 30:31.202
Not since you put stuff
under my tongue.

30:31.372 --> 30:33.031
MVA with pneumothorax.

30:33.206 --> 30:36.290
He had some chest pain
but responded very nicely to the nitro.

30:36.459 --> 30:40.836
I'm going off duty. Dr. Kovac here is
gonna continue to manage your care.

30:41.004 --> 30:44.005
He flipped T waves in the anterior leads
waiting for a Tele bed.

30:44.174 --> 30:46.795
- Is that bad?
- You could be at risk for heart attack.

30:46.968 --> 30:51.843
- We need to admit you for observation.
- Did they start his surgery? My son.

30:52.014 --> 30:54.505
They took him to the Operating Room
for his leg.

30:54.683 --> 30:58.134
- But nobody's told me how he's doing.
- Dr. Kovac can find out for you.

30:58.311 --> 31:00.932
Good luck, Mr. Harris. Happy New Year.

31:01.230 --> 31:03.602
Were you having chest pain
before your collision?

31:03.774 --> 31:05.315
No, I don't remember anything.

31:05.484 --> 31:07.772
- Did you pass out?
- What do you mean?

31:07.944 --> 31:11.395
With angina,
you can get an irregular heartbeat.

31:11.572 --> 31:14.194
- And that can cause you to pass out?
- Yeah.

31:14.367 --> 31:17.818
Because your heart doesn't pump
enough blood to your brain.

31:17.995 --> 31:22.206
- Could that have caused my accident?
- It happens a lot.

31:25.501 --> 31:28.335
- So it wasn't my fault?
- What?

31:28.920 --> 31:31.874
- The accident.
- Probably not.

31:32.048 --> 31:34.752
- I gotta talk to my wife.
- Does your chest hurt?

31:34.926 --> 31:38.259
- Like a son of a bitch.
- Malik, I need some help here.

31:38.595 --> 31:41.596
- Pressure's down to 80 systolic.
- ST elevation on the monitor.

31:41.765 --> 31:43.757
Mix up the dopamine.
He's having an MI.

31:43.933 --> 31:46.222
- What's an MI?
- A heart attack.

31:46.394 --> 31:49.893
- We need to go to the cath lab now.
- What are you gonna do there?

31:50.064 --> 31:52.933
You got a blocked artery on your heart.
We need to open it up.

31:53.107 --> 31:54.851
Hold on. I gotta talk to my wife.

31:56.402 --> 31:58.774
Dr. Burke, he's awake.

31:59.613 --> 32:02.400
Hey, Mark. Do you know where you are?

32:03.283 --> 32:06.034
- Hospital.
- That's right. You're in Recovery.

32:06.286 --> 32:09.202
- What's the date?
- New Year's Eve.

32:09.622 --> 32:11.413
And who's that?

32:13.625 --> 32:16.542
I've never seen her before in my life.

32:16.710 --> 32:20.708
- She's pretty darn cute.
- Hold out your hands.

32:21.966 --> 32:24.004
Wiggle your fingers.

32:24.967 --> 32:28.003
Now wiggle your toes.

32:28.762 --> 32:30.138
Very good.

32:30.764 --> 32:34.133
- How did it go?
- Fantastic.

32:34.309 --> 32:37.974
Resected the tumor with clean margins.
Chemotherapy wafers are in.

32:38.229 --> 32:42.974
- You see? You made it. I told you.
- Now get some rest, both of you.

32:43.150 --> 32:46.435
I'll be back in an hour
for a neuro check.

32:50.656 --> 32:53.146
Do you remember anything?

32:53.659 --> 32:55.817
Something about a baby.

32:56.786 --> 32:58.909
We discussed a boy's name.

33:02.458 --> 33:05.078
We're gonna have a boy.

33:05.669 --> 33:09.037
God! Feels like someone
parked a Volvo on my chest.

33:09.214 --> 33:12.463
- He's still throwing PVCs.
- Could be his chest tube.

33:12.633 --> 33:14.507
I'll try to reposition.

33:14.677 --> 33:18.970
- I need to talk to my wife.
- I'll explain what happened. Just relax.

33:19.139 --> 33:20.929
Oh, God.

33:22.016 --> 33:25.634
Me and my son had to be arguing
when this happened.

33:25.978 --> 33:27.851
- How old is he?
- Fifteen.

33:28.855 --> 33:30.764
Part of being that age.

33:30.940 --> 33:33.811
He needs your support the most
when he wants it the least.

33:33.985 --> 33:37.151
- You a dad?
- No.

33:37.738 --> 33:41.984
- Mrs. Harris would like to come in.
- For a minute.

33:45.118 --> 33:47.195
You look like a nurse.

33:49.456 --> 33:52.207
- Paul's awake.
- Is he okay?

33:52.375 --> 33:57.203
Yeah. They took the tube out,
and he's breathing on his own, and...

33:57.380 --> 34:02.965
- Well, he's asking for a cheeseburger.
- Oh, God. Thank you.

34:03.468 --> 34:04.878
Hey, honey.

34:05.052 --> 34:08.005
What happened? You okay?

34:08.179 --> 34:12.722
I got a blocked artery on my heart.

34:13.226 --> 34:16.760
I guess those sliders
finally caught up with me.

34:17.063 --> 34:21.889
The docs figure that the blockage
made me pass out this morning.

34:22.067 --> 34:24.556
That's what caused the accident.

34:25.112 --> 34:28.978
Oh, God.
I'm really sorry about downstairs.

34:29.157 --> 34:34.398
- I just... He was lying there, and-
- And you thought I did it again.

34:34.578 --> 34:36.071
- Dan, stop.
- Okay.

34:36.245 --> 34:39.080
I think it's time
for visiting hours to end.

34:39.956 --> 34:41.914
Mrs. Harris.

34:43.918 --> 34:48.045
- Tell Paul I'll see him in a bit.
- You better.

34:49.841 --> 34:53.422
I'm going on break, Dr. Corday.
Can I bring you back something?

34:53.594 --> 34:56.049
No, thanks. I'm fine, Terry.

34:59.098 --> 35:00.972
I have to go now. I'm late.

35:01.142 --> 35:05.850
It's good to see you have your sense
of humor. I suppose that's a good sign.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.937
- Mark? Mark?
- I left the oven on.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.980
He's off the monitor.

35:11.150 --> 35:15.017
- I know. I know. He's altered.
- Where are my car keys?

35:15.195 --> 35:17.769
- Can you give him Valium?
- I have no order for that.

35:17.948 --> 35:20.782
- Lie back down.
- No. The lasagna, it's gonna burn.

35:20.951 --> 35:23.820
Look, he needs sedation
and a stat head CT.

35:23.994 --> 35:26.201
- No, I need to leave.
- I can't take your orders.

35:26.372 --> 35:28.743
- You're not staff.
- He could have an epidural bleed.

35:28.916 --> 35:31.488
- Get Dr. Burke.
- He was called to an emergency consult.

35:31.667 --> 35:32.829
What do you think this is?

35:34.920 --> 35:36.663
- What's going on?
- Trauma patient...

35:36.838 --> 35:39.792
- ... had a coronary thrombosis.
- Why wasn't I consulted?

35:39.966 --> 35:42.042
- Cardiology's handling it.
- I can see that.

35:42.218 --> 35:44.589
What about our
glycoprotein 2B3A inhibitor study?

35:44.761 --> 35:48.973
- He didn't meet the criteria.
- I decide who meets the criteria.

35:49.141 --> 35:50.967
What? You mean I didn't need this?

35:51.142 --> 35:53.265
On a low-fat diet,
you wouldn't need any of this.

35:53.436 --> 35:54.467
- Damn!
- What's wrong?

35:54.645 --> 35:57.136
- There's a dissection in the left main.
- Nice work.

35:57.315 --> 35:58.808
What's wrong? What's happened?

35:58.982 --> 36:01.604
The catheter made a small tear
in your blood vessel.

36:01.818 --> 36:03.775
- What?
- He's dropping his pressure!

36:03.945 --> 36:05.937
- Multifocal PVCs.
- Hundred of lidocaine.

36:06.114 --> 36:08.485
- He's a surgical patient now.
- Up dopamine to 20 mics.

36:08.740 --> 36:10.899
- Notify the O.R.
- What's wrong?

36:11.076 --> 36:14.326
It's a complication. The only way
to save your heart is bypass surgery.

36:14.496 --> 36:16.286
- Open-heart surgery?
- Yep.

36:16.455 --> 36:17.570
- When?
- Right now.

36:17.748 --> 36:19.824
- Can't we talk about this?
- Let's go.

36:32.845 --> 36:36.295
Hey, Mark.
You had us a little worried.

36:37.515 --> 36:39.886
No. No sign of post-op bleeding.

36:40.058 --> 36:42.466
But the steroids
made you a little crazy.

36:42.811 --> 36:46.855
- What did I say?
- I've heard much worse.

36:47.023 --> 36:51.518
Look, I'll check on you in a little bit.
Call me if you need me, okay?

36:52.862 --> 36:55.268
Mark, I'll be right back. All right?

36:55.447 --> 36:57.356
Dr. Burke.

37:22.303 --> 37:24.010
Hey.

37:25.473 --> 37:27.132
Hey.

37:32.812 --> 37:35.847
- Hey.
- Pressure's down to 70. Dr. Karis!

37:36.022 --> 37:39.521
Put him in Trendelenberg. Squeeze in
two units. Get me a staple remover.

37:39.692 --> 37:43.275
- A liter out of the chest.
- Get him off the vent. Bag him on 100%.

37:43.446 --> 37:45.070
Tell the blood bank we need six.

37:45.239 --> 37:49.735
Splash him with Betadine.
Open a thoracotomy tray. Wire cutters!

37:49.910 --> 37:53.325
- He's tachy at 130.
- Ready for rib spreaders.

37:57.917 --> 38:01.748
He's ruptured his aortic trunk.
Side-biting clamp.

38:06.215 --> 38:08.967
- I'll see you in Recovery.
- You're not coming with me?

38:09.135 --> 38:12.966
You're with the surgical team now.
Say goodbye to Dr. Kovac.

38:13.138 --> 38:14.845
Good luck.

38:19.976 --> 38:22.550
- I don't want surgery.
- You don't really have a choice.

38:22.729 --> 38:25.137
- I want a second opinion.
- But you'd be dead...

38:25.315 --> 38:27.022
...before a doctor could examine you.

38:27.191 --> 38:30.974
Let's move! We got no time!
I wanna be cutting in five minutes.

38:31.153 --> 38:36.776
Okay, we're gonna scoot you over now.
Ready and lift.

38:38.701 --> 38:42.034
Mr. Harris, I'm Dr. Babcock,
the anesthesiologist.

38:42.204 --> 38:45.370
- Are you allergic to any drugs?
- No.

38:45.540 --> 38:49.205
- Are you taking any medications?
- Just the stuff they gave me today.

38:49.377 --> 38:52.163
- What's he on, Shirley?
- Dopamine, lidocaine and nitro.

38:52.337 --> 38:55.670
Ever have a bad reaction
to an anesthetic?

38:55.840 --> 38:57.500
- Mr. Harris?
- No.

38:57.675 --> 39:00.842
- Why isn't this guy under?
- I had to throw in an art line.

39:01.012 --> 39:03.502
- Gown me.
- You're the guy in the Emergency Room.

39:03.680 --> 39:07.214
- Dr. Benton does it all.
- You were in a collision with your son.

39:07.392 --> 39:11.934
- You're gonna go to sleep now.
- Wait, I got a bad feeling about this.

39:12.104 --> 39:13.433
- Pump primed and ready?
- Set.

39:13.606 --> 39:15.562
No, I'm not gonna make it. I know it.

39:15.732 --> 39:18.021
- You'll make it.
- You gotta tell my son something.

39:18.193 --> 39:21.727
- You can tell him after the operation.
- Not if we don't get in there soon.

39:21.904 --> 39:26.612
Please tell him that I love him.
And that I'm very proud of him...

39:26.783 --> 39:28.575
- ... more than he'll...
- Let's tube him.

39:28.744 --> 39:31.946
Okay, let's go.
The clock's ticking, his heart isn't.

39:32.997 --> 39:35.322
Okay, Mark.
Follow my finger with your eyes.

39:35.832 --> 39:38.074
- Mark, follow his finger.
- Mrs. Street?

39:38.335 --> 39:40.707
- Why don't we go to the Waiting Room?
- Sorry.

39:40.879 --> 39:44.128
- They'll call you with updates.
- Okay.

39:50.053 --> 39:53.219
What were the three things
I asked you to remember?

39:54.724 --> 39:57.393
The three items. Remember?

39:57.726 --> 40:01.889
Giraffe, beach ball, 123 Main Street.

40:02.063 --> 40:03.806
Three for three.

40:03.981 --> 40:06.104
- Do you know what happened to him?
- Who?

40:06.275 --> 40:08.564
The heart kid.

40:09.278 --> 40:13.227
They got him to the O.R.
It's touch-and-go.

40:13.406 --> 40:15.861
I'm gonna have somebody
from Psychiatry talk to you.

40:16.033 --> 40:18.358
- No, thanks.
- I recommend it to all my patients.

40:18.535 --> 40:21.869
Depression suppresses the
immune system. It can hinder recovery.

40:22.038 --> 40:25.039
I don't need a therapist.
I could get this Foley out.

40:25.208 --> 40:28.541
- If you have urinary retention-
- A nurse can throw another one in.

40:28.711 --> 40:29.742
Mark.

40:29.920 --> 40:32.791
The sooner I get it out,
the sooner I can walk.

40:32.965 --> 40:36.499
The sooner I can walk,
the sooner I get out of here.

40:36.676 --> 40:40.424
- No offense.
- Okay, I'll take out the Foley.

40:40.763 --> 40:44.594
- Bathroom privileges?
- Only if somebody walks you.

40:49.604 --> 40:51.595
You're a lucky guy, Mark.

40:51.772 --> 40:56.979
There has never been a more
successful treatment for your tumor.

40:57.152 --> 41:01.943
If you believe that
and mobilize your inner resources...

41:02.281 --> 41:03.822
...you're gonna survive.

41:08.286 --> 41:11.985
Time of death 2048.

41:21.381 --> 41:23.503
He didn't make it.

41:23.674 --> 41:25.133
No.

41:26.384 --> 41:28.294
But I did.

41:28.762 --> 41:30.386
Yeah.

41:31.138 --> 41:33.261
You fixed my heart.

41:33.474 --> 41:34.754
Yep.

41:34.933 --> 41:37.720
I didn't even know
I had a heart problem.

41:37.894 --> 41:40.136
That car accident saved my life.

41:40.313 --> 41:43.064
You never heard of a yearly checkup?

41:46.276 --> 41:48.518
- Hey, son.
- You okay?

41:48.695 --> 41:52.146
Yeah. I feel like I got hit
by a truck. Again.

41:53.825 --> 41:55.069
Did you sleep well?

41:55.784 --> 41:58.868
Yeah, except when you were yapping
in my ear, asking me to wake up.

41:59.245 --> 42:02.080
- I notice you didn't listen.
- I was in a coma.

42:02.248 --> 42:05.284
You know, you always got an excuse.

42:06.252 --> 42:07.793
Hey, son.

42:07.961 --> 42:12.255
I guess this means you're not gonna
play hockey anymore this year, huh?

42:12.424 --> 42:15.838
They said the cast will be off
in six to eight weeks.

42:16.010 --> 42:18.679
Your leg's broken. It's weak.
Let it heal.

42:18.845 --> 42:20.838
Well, I'll be doing physiotherapy.

42:21.014 --> 42:25.925
- Maybe we can start running together.
- Trying to give me another heart attack?

42:29.605 --> 42:31.762
You gave me a scare, Dad.

42:33.608 --> 42:35.517
You too.

42:37.028 --> 42:41.025
We're under a minute, Dick,
and Times Square is raring to go.

42:42.240 --> 42:47.281
- Some rocking New Year's Eve, huh?
- It'll do.

42:48.788 --> 42:52.536
When are they gonna come
take this damn Foley out?

42:52.708 --> 42:55.910
It's been over three hours
since he put in the order.

42:56.086 --> 42:59.002
I think she's busy
with another patient.

42:59.171 --> 43:02.291
I can't wait any longer. I gotta pee.

43:02.466 --> 43:04.375
Then go.

43:06.844 --> 43:10.888
- Mark.
- Come on. You know how to do it.

43:15.768 --> 43:18.438
I can't believe I'm doing this.

43:35.493 --> 43:39.325
I don't think I could order those
for a patient ever again.

43:39.497 --> 43:41.620
Are you sure you're up to this?

43:41.791 --> 43:43.747
Nature calls.

43:45.294 --> 43:47.701
- Easy.
- I got it.

43:47.880 --> 43:50.915
You're not supposed to do this
on your own, you know.

43:51.090 --> 43:54.423
Once I get in there,
can I stand on my own?

43:54.593 --> 43:57.262
No. You can sit.

43:58.180 --> 44:02.343
- Okay, let me try.
- All right.

44:07.772 --> 44:11.186
See? It's not a race.
You just be careful.

44:11.357 --> 44:16.150
Okay. Small steps. I know.
Small steps.

44:17.738 --> 44:21.236
That's it. See, you're doing it.
