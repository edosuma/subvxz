( playing classical music )

00:43.177 --> 00:48.916
( playing classical music )

00:48.982 --> 00:50.784
Stop it!

00:50.851 --> 00:52.553
Stop it!

00:52.620 --> 00:54.522
It's not time
to do that right now.

00:56.624 --> 00:57.891
But it's beautiful.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.960
It's not time to do it,
I told you--

01:00.027 --> 01:01.229
I told you...

01:01.295 --> 01:02.596
to do your homework.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.601
Go to your room, go to your
room, go to your room.
Hey.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.137
Go to your room,
go to your room.
Hey... Daddy!

01:09.203 --> 01:10.504
Go to your room,
go to your room!

01:10.571 --> 01:12.540
Go to your room,
go to your room.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.678
This is bullshit.

01:38.132 --> 01:39.833
Can someone help me
at all?

01:42.336 --> 01:43.971
Yeah, I'll help you.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.174
Thank you very much,
I appreciate it.

01:51.379 --> 01:54.848
So I was-- I was wondering
about this DVD player.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.550
Yeah?

01:56.617 --> 01:59.720
Well, does it play just
Blu-ray or regular DVDs?

02:04.925 --> 02:07.961
Uh...

02:08.028 --> 02:10.498
I'm not sure.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.032
You want to know
if it plays DVDs?

02:12.099 --> 02:13.601
No, I--
( cell phone ringing )

02:18.606 --> 02:20.107
Hello?
Hey.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.009
I was helping you.
No, you weren't.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.344
- Hello?
- ( beeping )

02:23.411 --> 02:24.812
Operator:
Please hold for...

02:24.878 --> 02:27.515
( man )
Excelsior C.K.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.049
Excelsior?

02:29.116 --> 02:31.519
Oh, yeah.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.587
Hello... Louie.
( static in distance )

02:33.654 --> 02:36.324
Uncle X,
hi, how are you?
I am well.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.125
How are you yourself?
I'm okay.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.960
I'm kinda--
I'm kind of busy right now.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.529
I am busy myself.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.331
Shall we hang up?
No, no.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.433
I'm-- I'm sorry.

02:45.499 --> 02:49.036
I'm coming to New York and
I wonder if we could meet?

02:49.102 --> 02:50.604
Oh, uh...

02:50.671 --> 02:53.207
We should have
lunch tomorrow.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.542
Do you accept?

02:54.608 --> 02:57.311
You know, I have--
I have my kids with me.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.679
I guess I could get
a sitter, um...

02:58.746 --> 03:00.013
Very well, then.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.916
Meet me at the Russian
Tea Room at 2:00 p.m.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.718
Okay.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.654
I look forward to it,
Louie.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.788
( beeping )

03:11.592 --> 03:12.626
( sighing )

03:14.462 --> 03:17.064
Oh, jeez...
( laughing )

03:17.130 --> 03:18.466
Shit!

03:20.401 --> 03:22.270
Luther Vandross, right?

03:22.336 --> 03:23.537
Cool.
Excuse me.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.274
Yes, sir.

03:26.340 --> 03:29.076
Are you
the manager here?

03:29.142 --> 03:31.445
One of your employees
just assaulted me.

03:31.512 --> 03:34.582
That's pretty serious.
Mm-hmm.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.484
Will you come
this way?
Yeah.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.088
Get security to
meet me at the office.

03:41.154 --> 03:42.823
Okay, so this was about
20 minutes ago.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.558
Can you see which
camera you were near?

03:46.327 --> 03:47.661
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's us right there.

03:47.728 --> 03:48.696
Okay.

03:48.762 --> 03:49.697
( beeping )

03:52.666 --> 03:54.001
Is that me?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.403
That's not me.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.037
Yeah, man, that's you.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.972
That's what
I look like?

03:59.039 --> 04:00.708
Mm-hmm.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.944
All right, okay,
see what he's doing?

04:04.011 --> 04:05.313
See?

04:07.281 --> 04:08.982
Okay, now watch
what happens.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.853
( laughing )
Shit!

04:14.655 --> 04:17.090
Clearly, he acted
inappropriately.

04:17.157 --> 04:18.292
How would you
like to proceed?

04:18.359 --> 04:20.260
Do you wish to press
charges?

04:20.328 --> 04:22.463
( chuckling )

04:26.066 --> 04:27.601
Thank you very much.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.138
Thanks a lot.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.340
( laughing )

04:32.406 --> 04:33.607
Show me that
shit again.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.485
Is this closed?

04:50.591 --> 04:53.026
( Excelsior )
Louie, Louie.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.161
( chuckling )

04:54.227 --> 04:55.763
Hello, welcome.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.365
Come, sit.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.901
Ahh...
Hi.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.370
Hi.

05:03.904 --> 05:04.705
Hi.
How are you?

05:04.772 --> 05:06.807
Hi.

05:06.874 --> 05:10.177
You are-- you are in
show business now?

05:10.243 --> 05:12.312
Yeah, yeah.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.647
Then tell me.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.416
Tell me
all about that.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.250
Well, it's-- well,
it's going pretty well.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.252
I got this show and--
That's wonderful.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.356
Listen, why I want to
see you--
Okay.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.725
I was in Boston yesterday

05:24.792 --> 05:27.595
because I bought
a credenza in Geneva.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.463
I was there
representing Mexico

05:29.530 --> 05:32.666
at an international
finance-analysis conference

05:32.733 --> 05:33.534
and I was invited to
the palace

05:33.601 --> 05:35.202
of some sort of duke.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.771
He had this
wonderful credenza

05:37.838 --> 05:41.308
and I asked him about it
and he said...

05:41.375 --> 05:43.711
Well, he was this
kind of man-- hmm--

05:43.777 --> 05:46.414
who has a hunting dog
by his side

05:46.480 --> 05:48.048
and boots, you know?

05:48.115 --> 05:51.785
You know, like... like
this kind of man, you know?

05:51.852 --> 05:54.087
( laughing )

05:54.154 --> 05:55.989
You know?
Okay.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.425
( chuckling )

05:58.659 --> 06:00.160
And so this duke,
I said to him,

06:00.227 --> 06:01.629
"What a wonderful credenza."

06:01.695 --> 06:04.865
And he says, "I must
make you a gift of one."

06:04.932 --> 06:08.736
( chuckling )

06:08.802 --> 06:10.137
You know?

06:10.203 --> 06:11.539
This-- this kind of...

06:11.605 --> 06:15.308
"Mmm, mmm, mmm..."

06:15.375 --> 06:17.611
And so he gave me one

06:17.678 --> 06:19.980
and I had it
shipped to Boston

06:20.047 --> 06:22.916
and I'm having it
redone

06:22.983 --> 06:24.585
by the most excellent

06:24.652 --> 06:27.655
historical
carpenter in Boston.

06:27.721 --> 06:32.993
And while I was in Boston,
I saw your father.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.034
Yes.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.270
Your father.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.739
Do you know
what he told me?

06:45.806 --> 06:47.007
No.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.108
Waiter.

06:50.678 --> 06:53.481
We'd like two Cornish hens
and some water.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.884
Listen, my-- my--

06:56.950 --> 06:59.386
When I was a boy,
I had a horse

06:59.453 --> 07:01.054
given to me
by my father,

07:01.121 --> 07:03.256
your abuelo.

07:03.323 --> 07:05.559
And when
I went away to school,

07:05.626 --> 07:09.396
I gave that horse to your
father to care for

07:09.463 --> 07:12.500
and in three months,
he let my horse die.

07:15.769 --> 07:16.770
Yeah.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.272
So...

07:19.339 --> 07:21.141
Louie, let me
ask you something.

07:23.511 --> 07:26.213
When a man has intercourse
with a prostitute

07:26.279 --> 07:29.583
and he covers his organ...

07:29.650 --> 07:31.652
with protection

07:31.719 --> 07:34.054
so that he won't
catch her wretchedness,

07:34.121 --> 07:36.957
he's acting in
the interest of his family

07:37.024 --> 07:39.226
so that he won't take it
home to his wife.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.828
Hmm?

07:40.894 --> 07:42.796
That's--
that's a question?

07:42.863 --> 07:44.665
But...

07:44.732 --> 07:48.401
between a father and a son,

07:48.468 --> 07:52.239
there can be
no separation.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.708
No boundary.

07:54.775 --> 07:58.378
A father calls,
a son answers.

07:58.445 --> 08:02.382
A father beckons,
a son comes.

08:02.449 --> 08:05.085
This is for life, Louie.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.488
For life.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.624
I saw your father.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.793
He was alone.
He has no one.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.762
I could not even look at him
and he cried to me,

08:14.828 --> 08:18.966
"Ooh, my son, he does not
call me, does not see me."

08:19.032 --> 08:21.569
It was disgusting,
like a woman.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.437
Listen, can I just--

08:24.504 --> 08:27.207
When a father--
Can I please--

08:27.274 --> 08:29.843
Uncle X, just let me say
one thing, okay, please?

08:29.910 --> 08:31.612
No.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.447
You go and see
your father.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.216
You go and see him.

08:36.283 --> 08:39.119
Louie, Louie.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.589
Louie.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.224
For shame.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.959
Shame on you,
shame on you.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.995
Shame on you, shame on you,
Louie, shame on you.

08:50.497 --> 08:52.465
Go and see
your father.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.401
You go and see him.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.970
Yes.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.972
Yes.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.441
Shame.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.143
Shame on you.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.458
Make a bet, man.

09:18.525 --> 09:19.827
Give me a second.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.695
You already took 7,000.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.131
I'm trying to
figure out what to do.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.666
Well, then fold.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.567
Don't tell him to fold,
I want his money.

09:27.635 --> 09:28.702
Call.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.170
And after all that,
he calls.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.204
Goddamn it.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.406
I raise it five.
Five?!

09:33.473 --> 09:34.975
How do you guys have
so much money?

09:35.042 --> 09:36.209
That's like
the cheesiest--

09:36.276 --> 09:37.811
I don't have five.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.680
You could sell
your tits on eBay.

09:39.747 --> 09:40.981
You'd get like seven bucks
for those.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.183
Yeah, but shipping
would be, like, five bucks.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.985
I'd clear $2.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.920
And then I'd also have
big bloody holes

09:46.987 --> 09:49.489
where my tits used to be.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.625
I would still ( bleep ).
Oh...

09:51.692 --> 09:53.160
In the titty hole?

09:53.226 --> 09:55.095
Right in the two titty holes,
her new titty holes.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.630
Oh, my God.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.832
* Rah-rah-rah-rah-rah
rah-rah-rah... **

09:58.899 --> 10:00.768
Give me a 20, sweetie.
Yeah.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.737
( man )
I call.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.606
Oh, you left something
in here, Jim.

10:06.674 --> 10:08.075
Give me that, give me that,
give me that.
Wait, wait, whoa.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.342
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.978
What is this?

10:11.044 --> 10:12.179
Oh, my God.
Drawn by a child,
I guess.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.148
Please, please,
give me that, please.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.785
Jim, why do you have
a child's crude drawing

10:17.851 --> 10:19.687
of a woman with
a scribbly bush

10:19.753 --> 10:21.588
sucking a big cock?

10:21.655 --> 10:23.390
It's not a child's
drawing.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.492
I drew it.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.360
( Louie )
Oh, you're gonna
have to tell the--
There's no story.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.196
You're gonna have to
tell the story.
There's no story.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.464
You drew this?
( man )
Okay, can we play poker?

10:31.531 --> 10:33.433
( man )
Why did you draw that?
Tell the story now.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.036
Because, um, I get horny

10:36.103 --> 10:38.338
and I've always
gotten horny, really horny.
Okay.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.841
And when I was growing up,
we didn't have "Playboys,"

10:40.908 --> 10:42.976
'cause they weren't allowed
and my mother would ( bleep )

10:43.043 --> 10:46.413
clear my room out and so I would
just draw tits and pussies.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.716
Like this?

10:48.782 --> 10:50.818
Big tits and big
hairy pussies.
That's been in your pocket
since you was a kid?

10:50.884 --> 10:53.854
No, stupid, I just--
I draw them regularly.
Let me get this straight.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.488
You jack off to your own

10:55.555 --> 10:57.891
drawings of
tits and pussies?

10:57.958 --> 10:59.827
That's a lot of work
to get a nut off.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.528
I think it's sweet.

11:01.594 --> 11:04.832
( laughing )

11:06.700 --> 11:08.368
You still draw
like a little kid.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.870
I know.
All right, all right.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.839
This is new,
this is new.
Yes, it's new.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.807
This is
contemporary work.
Yes, it's contemporary work.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.675
And you jerk off
to this?
Yes, I do.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.244
So what?

11:17.310 --> 11:18.345
Can you go to the doughnut shop
and get me a cruller?

11:18.411 --> 11:20.280
( all laughing )

11:20.347 --> 11:22.950
Did you guys see this article
in "The New York Times"?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.852
It was about ancient forms
of pornography

11:24.918 --> 11:26.686
and they're talking about
wood carvings from the--

11:26.754 --> 11:28.221
( all )
Whoa!

11:28.288 --> 11:29.189
That's it, I'm out.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.924
Oh!
Ugh.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.292
I know I tell a bad story,
but wow.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.661
( man )
I can't play ( bleep )
cards with you people,

11:34.728 --> 11:35.863
throwing up all over
the... place.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.564
( woman )
Sweetie, are you okay?

11:37.630 --> 11:39.132
I'm sorry,
I don't know what happened.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.901
( Jim )
Jesus, Louie, you got me
right in the face!

11:44.972 --> 11:47.607
Well.
So what is this?

11:47.674 --> 11:49.109
Well, here's the thing.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.911
Rashes and vomiting don't
usually go together.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.780
And if they do,
it's usually...

11:52.846 --> 11:54.214
fever, aches and pains

11:54.281 --> 11:55.715
and you don't
have any of that.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.384
No, I actually feel
pretty good except for

11:57.450 --> 12:00.587
I have a rash and I'm vomiting
for no reason.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.423
Right, so, you know, what we
look for in cases like this

12:03.490 --> 12:04.992
is what else
might be going on.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.962
What-- what else?

12:09.029 --> 12:11.664
You know, what else
is going on?

12:11.731 --> 12:13.566
What do you--
what do you mean?

12:13.633 --> 12:15.202
In your life,
what's new?

12:15.268 --> 12:17.204
Any new stress?

12:17.270 --> 12:18.972
Oh, uh...

12:19.039 --> 12:21.574
Well, no, I mean,
I got kids and I work,

12:21.641 --> 12:25.813
it's hard sometimes, but,
y'know, boilerplate misery,

12:25.879 --> 12:27.447
alone in the world,

12:27.514 --> 12:29.783
might as well be a maggot
sucking a dead cat's face,

12:29.850 --> 12:30.851
what's the point?

12:30.918 --> 12:33.120
But nothing new.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.654
Have you eaten anything
recently

12:34.721 --> 12:37.157
that you're not used to?

12:37.224 --> 12:40.460
I had corn flakes yesterday,
I had pizza.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.065
I had a Cornish hen.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.300
Where'd you have
Cornish hen?
( clearing throat )

12:47.367 --> 12:48.701
Um...

12:48.768 --> 12:50.237
The Russian Tea Room.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.005
Fancy.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.741
Yeah, I was with
my uncle and...

12:54.808 --> 12:56.143
Yeah?

12:56.209 --> 12:57.410
He said...

12:57.477 --> 12:58.778
Oh, oh, boy.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.881
I think we found
the virus.
Yeah.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.616
What did--
what did your uncle say?

13:03.683 --> 13:06.386
Sorry.
Yeah, take your time.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.521
Ugh.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.024
He said...

13:11.091 --> 13:12.259
He told me
to go see my dad.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.693
Oh.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.196
When's the last time
you saw your dad?

13:16.263 --> 13:18.065
Two years ago--
I don't talk to him.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.933
But I...

13:20.000 --> 13:22.502
What's weird is I didn't get
upset when he said it, I...

13:22.569 --> 13:24.537
I got annoyed with him,
but I didn't-- I didn't--

13:24.604 --> 13:27.174
Well, clearly, your body wasn't
ready to take it all in

13:27.240 --> 13:28.976
and whatever
it is with your dad,

13:29.042 --> 13:33.013
it's too big for your actual
conscious mind to take in

13:33.080 --> 13:35.949
and your nervous system,

13:36.016 --> 13:38.919
and so it's coming out your
skin and your stomach.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.688
That sounds--
that sounds right.

13:41.754 --> 13:44.024
I think you ought to--
I think you better
go see your dad

13:44.091 --> 13:47.460
or decide it's okay
not to see your dad.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.497
Either way.

13:50.563 --> 13:51.965
I think I'm gonna...

13:52.032 --> 13:52.900
Here, okay, hold on,
I got-- here...

13:52.966 --> 13:54.101
( vomiting )

13:59.406 --> 14:01.341
( woman on PA )
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're making our final descent

14:01.408 --> 14:04.277
into Logan Airport in Boston
where your father lives.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.246
Please return your seat backs
to the upright position

14:06.313 --> 14:08.081
and turn off and stow your...

14:30.003 --> 14:31.138
( vomiting )

14:31.204 --> 14:32.973
Did he
just throw up?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.074
He just threw up
on the car.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.342
Sir!

14:35.408 --> 14:36.776
Sir!

14:36.843 --> 14:38.311
You can't
throw up on the car.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.181
I already did,
I'm sorry.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.050
Well, sir, you're gonna
have to clean that up.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.085
That's not your car.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.120
Hey, listen, I'm going to
see my father, okay?

14:47.187 --> 14:48.321
I'm a little distressed.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.957
I haven't seen him
in two years.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.291
Well, either
see him or don't see him.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.960
Make a decision,
be a man.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.494
You're 44 years old.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.963
It's your fault.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.737
( woman on GPS )
Make a left turn on
Walnut Street

15:04.804 --> 15:08.441
to get to
your father's house.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.511
You missed the turn to your
father's house.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.180
Okay, okay.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.115
Why are you
being such a...

15:15.182 --> 15:16.816
little pussy
about this?

15:16.883 --> 15:17.717
Shut up.

15:17.784 --> 15:20.187
He's your father.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.888
It's not like he...

15:21.955 --> 15:24.124
touched your dick
or something.

15:24.191 --> 15:26.493
No, it was nothing
like that.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.428
I just feel weird
around him, that's all,

15:28.495 --> 15:29.429
I just don't-- I--

15:29.496 --> 15:31.664
Why are you
yelling at me?

15:31.731 --> 15:33.033
I'm not even real.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.302
I'm aware of that, I--

15:35.368 --> 15:37.104
Look, I'm not trying to
argue with you.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.072
Of course,
most people would say

15:39.139 --> 15:40.873
that they want to be with
their dad all the time.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.209
Oh, shit!
( tires screeching )

15:43.576 --> 15:45.045
( horn honking )

15:45.112 --> 15:48.648
( horn honking )

15:48.715 --> 15:50.483
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.784
All right, I get it!

15:51.851 --> 15:54.354
I get it, your life is gonna
end if you don't move now!

15:54.421 --> 15:57.590
Jesus Christ.
You got a problem?

15:57.657 --> 16:00.327
You wanna start
something?
I'll "staht" something.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.695
You wanna start
something here?
You wanna "staht" something,
you Boston ignoramus?!

16:02.762 --> 16:04.097
You wanna "staht"
something?
Ignoramus?

16:04.164 --> 16:05.298
Yeah, ignoramus.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.200
Yeah, I'm sick of guys
like you.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.301
I'm glad I don't
live here anymore.
Hey, hey, hey.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.670
Your nose is bleeding.
What?

16:10.737 --> 16:12.105
Your nose is bleeding.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.473
Here.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

16:13.540 --> 16:14.741
Use this.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.411
Hey, man, I'm sorry,
I just--

16:18.478 --> 16:20.447
I'm stressed out,
I'm going to see my dad.

16:20.513 --> 16:21.981
Your dad?

16:22.049 --> 16:24.051
Yeah, I haven't seen him
in about two years.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.153
I haven't seen my dad
since he died.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.388
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

16:28.455 --> 16:29.622
You should think
about that, you queer.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.493
I'm sorry, man.
All right.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.295
Keep the rag too, okay?
Okay, man.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.497
Good luck
with your dad.

16:37.564 --> 16:38.665
Good luck, all right.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.467
Thanks, man, thank you.
Take it easy, mush.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.513
( breathing heavily )

17:24.744 --> 17:26.113
( doorbell ringing )

17:30.917 --> 17:32.119
( sighing )

17:46.866 --> 17:49.669
( dog barking )

18:00.046 --> 18:01.814
( engine revving )

18:52.265 --> 18:54.867
( motor revving )

19:32.305 --> 19:33.773
( beeping )

19:37.844 --> 19:39.178
( exhaling )

19:49.256 --> 19:51.791
( laughing )

19:59.699 --> 20:00.933
Whoo!
