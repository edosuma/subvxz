00:36.880 --> 00:37.800
Hi, Sam.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.280
Sam?

00:39.280 --> 00:42.080
Looks like we're in
for another fun night.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.400
Don't even
think about it.

00:50.560 --> 00:51.520
Yoo-hoo.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.000
Earth to Sam.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Oh, hi.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.080
When did
you guys get here?

00:56.080 --> 00:58.280
Must be a pretty
interesting book.

00:58.280 --> 00:59.280
It is.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.560
It's a history book.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.480
History? Could you find
something more boring?

01:03.480 --> 01:05.200
You didn't think
it was boring

01:05.200 --> 01:07.160
when you asked me to study
with you after school.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.080
[Tucker] Frank, study?

01:09.080 --> 01:10.720
All right,
I admit it.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.720
I thought it'd be
fun to hang out.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.120
I'm not much
for history,

01:14.120 --> 01:17.600
but uh-- I am fun
to hang out with,

01:17.600 --> 01:19.000
unlike some guys.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.920
Can we start?

01:26.280 --> 01:28.240
Some people think
history is boring

01:28.240 --> 01:31.200
'cause it's all about stuff
that's gone and forgotten.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.440
My story is about a guy

01:33.440 --> 01:36.240
who finds out that
the old saying is true.

01:36.240 --> 01:39.240
History always
repeats itself.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.240
And if you don't learn
from the past,

01:41.240 --> 01:44.640
you'll be doomed
to repeat it.

01:47.760 --> 01:49.040
Submitted for the approval

01:49.040 --> 01:51.200
of the Midnight Society,

01:51.200 --> 01:52.800
I call this story...

02:01.280 --> 02:05.160
In 431 B.C.,
the Spartan army invades

02:05.160 --> 02:07.480
the Ancient City of Attica.

02:07.480 --> 02:11.240
In 422 B.C.,
the Spartans win

02:11.240 --> 02:13.160
a major battle
at Amphipoles.

02:14.240 --> 02:15.680
<i> Jimmy was a smart guy</i>

02:15.680 --> 02:17.680
<i> who pretty much
had it all together.</i>

02:17.680 --> 02:20.600
<i> Except for when
it came to April.</i>

02:20.600 --> 02:23.280
<i> It's not easy telling
someone you like them.</i>

02:23.280 --> 02:26.440
<i> Especially if you're not sure
they feel the same way.</i>

02:28.720 --> 02:32.480
[Teacher] Now, what happened
at the end of the war?

02:35.760 --> 02:37.760
<i> Every day, Jimmy walked
home from school</i>

02:37.760 --> 02:39.360
<i> through the same park.</i>

02:39.360 --> 02:41.200
<i> This was like most days,</i>

02:41.200 --> 02:44.360
<i> except that events from
a time long ago</i>

02:44.360 --> 02:47.960
<i> were about to put their mark
on his life today.</i>

02:47.960 --> 02:49.520

03:00.720 --> 03:01.920
[Horse continues whinnying]

03:09.760 --> 03:11.200
[Jimmy humming]

03:33.160 --> 03:34.280
Aaahhh!

03:59.680 --> 04:00.760
Hi.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.320
Jimmy, hi.
How are you?

04:03.320 --> 04:04.720
I'm good.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.400
Can you believe
how boring

04:06.400 --> 04:08.320
this Greek
history stuff is?

04:08.320 --> 04:09.600
You think so?
Yeah.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.680
I really like it.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.080
I mean, I didn't
mean like bad boring.

04:13.080 --> 04:16.079
I meant like, I wish
she'd speak faster,

04:16.079 --> 04:18.480
so we could learn more
'cause it's so interesting

04:18.480 --> 04:20.040
kind of boring.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.920
Oh, I get it.

04:23.640 --> 04:24.840
Anyway.

04:26.520 --> 04:27.560
Did you know
they're opening

04:27.560 --> 04:28.880
the ice rink
on Saturday?

04:28.880 --> 04:30.560
Oh, really?
Yeah.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.080
I love skating.

04:32.080 --> 04:33.240
Do you like skating?

04:33.240 --> 04:35.360
I love it. I used
to go all the time.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.840
I love it, too.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.800
I like skating.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.760
I mean,
I said that already.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.560
Would you want
to get together

04:46.560 --> 04:48.520
sometime
and go skating?

04:50.160 --> 04:51.880
Guys,
what's happening?

04:51.880 --> 04:53.440
Not much.

04:53.440 --> 04:55.440
Saturday night's
the opening night,

04:55.440 --> 04:57.160
<i> Tower of Blood, part IV.
Do you want to go?</i>

04:59.200 --> 05:02.400
Um, Jimmy and I were
talking about maybe...

05:02.400 --> 05:05.000
No, no, no. Go to the
flick. I heard it's great.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.520
Uh--really,
just go ahead.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.040
Maybe some other time
we can get together.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.120
Hey.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.920
[Horse whinnies]

06:00.920 --> 06:04.920
What, do you think
I don't see you in there?

06:08.120 --> 06:10.960
Why don't you come
out of the bushes, huh?

06:10.960 --> 06:13.480
Come on out. You're not
gonna scare me again.

06:13.480 --> 06:14.520
Come on.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.320
Forget it.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.440
Harrisville.
Do you know the way?

06:23.440 --> 06:25.000
Harrisville, the way.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.040
What?

06:26.040 --> 06:27.480
[Someone shouting]

06:27.480 --> 06:28.960
They're approaching
from the west.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.520
Come with me.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.000
They'll hang you
if they catch you.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.200
What? No.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.160
Fire!

06:53.800 --> 06:55.800
They're reloading.
Now's our chance.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.440
We'll hide here
till they pass.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.240
Then you will direct
me to Harrisville.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.440
What's going on?!

07:18.440 --> 07:19.440
Aaahhh!

07:19.440 --> 07:21.440
Aaahhh!

07:21.440 --> 07:22.160
Jimmy?

07:23.800 --> 07:25.920
What--are you doing?

07:25.920 --> 07:27.480
Hey, bud,
you all right?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.440
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

07:33.440 --> 07:36.920
I just uh--
I lost a contact lens.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.800
Since when do you
wear contacts?

07:38.800 --> 07:40.440
Oh, I just started.
They're great!

07:40.440 --> 07:41.600
Let me see.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.160
Are you sure
you're OK?

07:43.160 --> 07:45.360
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.360
We'll help you
look for it.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.360
Oh, that's OK.
I can uh...

07:56.000 --> 07:56.920
[April] Did you find it?

07:56.920 --> 07:59.120
Yeah.
Yeah, I sure did.

08:04.960 --> 08:08.880
It's a button from
a minuteman uniform,

08:08.880 --> 08:10.880
late 18th Century.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.360
Ah, yeah.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.760
Found it in the park,
did you?

08:14.760 --> 08:16.880
How'd you know that?

08:16.880 --> 08:19.880
The Battle of Harrisville
was fought there...

08:19.880 --> 08:21.880
Over 200 years ago.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.360
The line between the
minutemen and the British

08:24.360 --> 08:26.880
ran right
through the park.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.360
But this here
is very unusual.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.560
Why?

08:30.560 --> 08:32.880
Well, most artifacts
that people bring in

08:32.880 --> 08:36.000
are old and rusted
and decayed.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.799
This looks new.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.880
If I didn't know better,

08:40.880 --> 08:44.920
I'd say a minuteman had
worn this this very day.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.040
Hey, all heads up.

09:08.520 --> 09:09.840
You gotta wake up, man.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.800
It's not like we're in
history class anymore.

09:11.800 --> 09:12.800
I'm sorry.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.040
Go on.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.320
You sure
you're OK?

09:17.320 --> 09:18.400
I'm fine.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.480
Sorry, the wind took it.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.840
Yeah, well,
now we've gotta go

09:26.840 --> 09:28.840
on a safari to find it.

09:28.840 --> 09:30.720
No, wait.
I'll get it.

09:30.720 --> 09:31.720
It's OK.
We can all go.

09:31.720 --> 09:32.480
No!

09:34.000 --> 09:35.320
Um, I mean
it was my fault.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.480
Look, I'll go get it

09:36.480 --> 09:37.680
and I'll catch up
with you guys later.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.920
I'll meet you
at Molly's, all right?

09:38.920 --> 09:40.320
You're sure?

09:40.320 --> 09:42.280
Yeah. Get me a cheeseburger
or something, OK?

09:43.440 --> 09:44.520
Suit yourself,

09:44.520 --> 09:46.480
but if you don't
find it, you're paying.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.840
Fire.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.360
[Sounds of gunfire]

10:09.360 --> 10:10.560
[Horses whinnying]

10:18.200 --> 10:19.600
That's all. I'm gone.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.680
Over here!

10:35.240 --> 10:36.640
The spy!

10:38.920 --> 10:40.160
After him!

11:11.000 --> 11:13.880
This is a stunt
or a joke, right, guys?

11:25.520 --> 11:26.920
Come on,
this isn't funny, guys.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.800
Uh--all right,
you got me.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.320
Now let's all just
go home and laugh.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.480
Long live Liberty!

11:43.480 --> 11:44.800
Get after him!

11:48.200 --> 11:49.440
Fire!

11:49.440 --> 11:50.560
[Gunfire]

11:54.360 --> 11:55.560
This way.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.560
They were
gonna hang me.

12:02.560 --> 12:03.760
I know.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.320
They'll do the same
to me if they catch me.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.760
How well do you
know these woods?

12:11.760 --> 12:13.760
Uh-- pretty well. I come
through them every day.

12:13.760 --> 12:14.800
Good.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.680
You will guide me
to Harrisville.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.760
Look, buddy, I don't
know what's going on,

12:19.760 --> 12:21.520
but I'm getting
out of here.

12:21.520 --> 12:22.760
You don't understand.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.240
I must get
to Harrisville.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.880
I'm lost if I don't.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.000
What is so important
about Harrisville?

12:30.840 --> 12:33.240
Have you ever
cared about somebody

12:33.240 --> 12:34.760
and didn't have the
courage to tell them?

12:36.320 --> 12:37.560
Yeah.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.320
What is her name?

12:42.840 --> 12:44.520
April.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.440
My love is Emiline.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.280
I once tried to
tell her I loved her.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.760
I looked
into her eyes,

12:57.760 --> 12:59.280
but the words
weren't there.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.760
Tonight in Harrisville, she's
marrying a man she doesn't love.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.160
I must get there,

13:07.160 --> 13:10.240
and give her this locket
as a sign of my love.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.200
I pray that
it will succeed

13:13.200 --> 13:14.760
where my words
have failed.

13:19.280 --> 13:21.120
I sense something
in you, friend.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.520
We share
the same spirit.

13:30.760 --> 13:31.920
To bind
our friendship.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.120
What year is this?

13:43.280 --> 13:45.880
The year of
our lord, 1780.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.360
There they are!
Get them!

13:54.360 --> 13:55.440
Run.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.720
We stand a better
chance apart.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.800
But please,
remember my plight.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.040
Fire!

14:06.200 --> 14:07.200
I don't believe this.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.400
[Horn blowing]

14:32.280 --> 14:37.600
I'd say, sometime
between 1770 and 1800.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.440
A nicely carved
deerbone handle.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.280
I'll give you
$150 for it.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.600
Um-- I'm sorry,
it's not for sale.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.680
About
the inscription?

14:52.680 --> 14:54.200
Lieutenant William.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.720
Ah, yeah.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.080
I seem to
remember something.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.080
You mean,
you've heard of him?

15:08.240 --> 15:13.400
I think you'll find
what you need here.

15:14.680 --> 15:18.320
I don't often
lend my books.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.520
Ah, but then, I don't
often meet a young man

15:20.520 --> 15:22.120
so interested in history.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.040
Teacher: 54 A.D.

has remembered rather badly,

15:35.320 --> 15:37.560
<i> One tragic case
that has become legend</i>

15:37.560 --> 15:39.040

15:40.560 --> 15:42.560

Why, Mr. Armstrong?

needs some help.

Your friend can wait.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.680
Sit down.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.760
[Teacher] The people in Rome
didn't believe at all...

16:23.720 --> 16:25.640
Hey, Jimmy,
where's my frisbee!

16:25.640 --> 16:28.000
Uh, sorry,
I couldn't find it.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.480
Hey, you owe me.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.920
Why didn't you
meet us at Molly's?

16:30.920 --> 16:32.440
I ordered you
a burger.

16:32.440 --> 16:33.480
Yeah,
and I ate it.

16:33.480 --> 16:34.600
Thanks.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.480
Would you turn
that down, please?

16:35.480 --> 16:36.560
What's up?

16:36.560 --> 16:39.000
You've been acting
kind of strange.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.560
Remember the other day
when you saw me in the ditch?

16:43.080 --> 16:45.080
I wasn't looking
for a contact lens.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.840
I was escaping
from redcoats.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.480
Red what?

16:50.480 --> 16:51.840
Redcoats.
They thought I was a spy.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.000
They were gonna hang me!

16:53.000 --> 16:54.560
Now they're gonna hang
Lieutenant William

16:54.560 --> 16:56.120
because he doesn't know
the way to Harrisville

16:56.120 --> 16:57.600
to tell Emiline
he loves her,

16:57.600 --> 16:59.320
and I've got to show him the
way before it's too late!

16:59.320 --> 17:01.520
Uh, yeah.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.599
I gotta go.

17:04.599 --> 17:05.720
Jimmy, wait.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.440
Hey, wait a second.
You're boom box.

17:08.440 --> 17:09.960
Yeah, what about it?

17:09.960 --> 17:11.599
Can I borrow it?

17:11.599 --> 17:13.520
What for?
You gonna play tunes

17:13.520 --> 17:15.000
for some pals
from deep space?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.319
Look, come on,
I'm not kidding, Josh!

17:17.319 --> 17:18.880
OK, fine,
take it.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.599
Thanks.

17:20.599 --> 17:21.599
I'm coming with you.

17:21.599 --> 17:22.359
No.

17:23.319 --> 17:26.440
Just wait here,
all right? I mean it.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.520
And hey, don't waste
my batteries.

17:59.440 --> 18:00.800
Done.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.360
In the name of
His Majesty, George III,

18:24.360 --> 18:26.880
King of England
and all its domains,

18:26.880 --> 18:29.240
and in accordance
with the act

18:29.240 --> 18:32.080
regulating treasonous acts
of 1777,

18:32.080 --> 18:35.680
I hereby commit the rebel,
Lieutenant William,

18:35.680 --> 18:37.400
to hang by the neck until...

18:37.400 --> 18:39.000
[Loud rock music]

18:40.160 --> 18:41.160
Surely...

18:48.080 --> 18:49.160
Follow me!

19:18.760 --> 19:23.280
Is there no end to the
treachery of these barbarians?!

19:26.000 --> 19:27.960
The spy!

19:38.200 --> 19:39.400
Whoa whoa.
Come here.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.400
There's a brook
in the woods.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.920
Follow it till it
crosses the old fence.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.400
Then follow
the fence.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.760
Take you right to
the edge of Harrisville.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.400
It's a secret route
I used as a kid.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.920
You have
to get to town.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.280
I'll draw
them off. Go!

19:55.240 --> 19:56.240
Thank you, my friend.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.840
don't make my mistake.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.440
If you love her,
tell her.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.120
Yeah, I will. Go, go!

20:09.520 --> 20:10.880
Here we go again.

20:12.520 --> 20:14.400
You aren't
escaping again!

20:19.720 --> 20:21.880
April, run!

20:27.680 --> 20:29.360
Leave us alone!

20:32.240 --> 20:34.480
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:34.480 --> 20:35.880
I didn't mean
to scare you.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.720
I didn't know anyone
was on the trail.

20:39.720 --> 20:43.360
Uh, no, I'm sorry.
See, I just thought you...

20:43.360 --> 20:44.440
Forget it.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.360
OK. Bye.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.360
Are you OK?

20:50.360 --> 20:51.920
Yeah. Are you OK?

20:55.360 --> 20:57.720
Oh, I hope he made it.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.600
Who?

21:01.680 --> 21:03.760
A friend.

21:09.240 --> 21:10.320
Why did you come?

21:10.320 --> 21:12.880
I was
worried about you.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.400
I care about you.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.960
I care about you, too,

21:17.960 --> 21:19.960
have for a long time.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.320
I just didn't
know how to say it.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.000
What changed
your mind?

21:39.120 --> 21:41.800
Why did that happen?

21:41.800 --> 21:43.320
Because he made it.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.160
He got promoted
to captain. He survived.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.320
For a long time,
I wanted to tell you

22:11.320 --> 22:12.840
how much
I cared about you.

22:12.840 --> 22:14.080
I just didn't
have the words.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.040
Maybe this
can say it for me.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.760
<i> That night, Jimmy checked
the history books</i>

22:35.760 --> 22:38.280
<i> that the antique dealer
had given him.</i>

22:38.280 --> 22:41.520
<i> The paragraph
about William had changed.</i>

22:41.520 --> 22:43.160
<i> It said that he made it
to Harrisville,</i>

22:43.160 --> 22:45.440
<i> proved his love to Emiline,</i>

22:45.440 --> 22:46.720
<i> and married her.</i>

22:46.720 --> 22:48.760
<i> As for Jimmy and April,</i>

22:48.760 --> 22:52.760
<i> well, I'll let you figure
that one out for yourselves.</i>

22:52.760 --> 22:53.840
The End.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.160
Cool!

22:55.160 --> 22:58.280
I guess history
can be interesting.

22:58.280 --> 22:59.840
Yeah, I guess.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.440
I've got a couple
of tickets

23:04.440 --> 23:06.280
to the Phantasmagoria
concert.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.000
I was wondering if maybe
you and I could...

23:08.000 --> 23:10.840
Uh-- ooh, I-I'm sorry.

23:10.840 --> 23:13.280
She's already
going with me.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.280
And me.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.320
I had 3 tickets.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.120
So, ladies.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.000
Guess that means uh--
you're history.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.080
You!
