00:09.300 --> 00:10.701
Help!

00:15.873 --> 00:19.276
Stacey, I'm Detective McNair.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.610
I'm here to take you home.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.879
It's gonna be okay.

00:26.217 --> 00:28.485
I knew you'd come, McNair.

00:28.519 --> 00:29.987
Hands.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.459
Let her go, Vlad.

00:35.493 --> 00:36.893
You have me as a hostage now.

00:36.928 --> 00:38.061
I'm greedy.

00:38.096 --> 00:39.396
I'm gonna take you both.

00:39.430 --> 00:40.864
Now, put the gun down.

00:47.672 --> 00:48.972
Kick it over.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.044
Aah!

01:00.551 --> 01:02.552
I'm greedy, too.

01:02.587 --> 01:03.587
For justice.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.431 --> 01:14.731
Looks like they're kicking me out.

01:14.766 --> 01:16.166
We're all about the tough love.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.001
Here are your papers for the court

01:18.036 --> 01:19.503
saying you completed your rehab,

01:19.537 --> 01:21.171
and the stuff you came in with.

01:22.740 --> 01:23.774
Ah!

01:23.808 --> 01:25.208
The outfit that trended.

01:25.243 --> 01:27.611
Hashtag, no underwear.
Hashtag, no dignity.

01:27.645 --> 01:30.113
Hashtag, no memory.

01:30.148 --> 01:31.782
Now that you're leaving,

01:31.816 --> 01:34.384
I have to tell you, I'm a huge fan.

01:34.419 --> 01:36.019
I loved you in "Hot Suspect."

01:36.054 --> 01:37.788
I wish they hadn't cancelled the show.

01:37.822 --> 01:39.315
You know what they say
behind that door...

01:39.350 --> 01:41.611
you have to accept the things
you cannot change,

01:41.645 --> 01:43.393
without the pills and booze.

01:43.428 --> 01:45.295
We're all rooting for you, Sam.

02:10.687 --> 02:12.055
Let's go.

02:21.299 --> 02:23.133
So, 60 days of sobriety,

02:23.167 --> 02:24.301
how are you feeling?

02:24.335 --> 02:25.569
Naked and afraid.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.671
I need to put all this behind me, Syd.

02:27.705 --> 02:28.730
I need to work.

02:28.764 --> 02:30.441
- Is there any work?
- I'm sorry, Sam,

02:30.475 --> 02:31.788
but after everything you did,

02:31.822 --> 02:33.176
no one wants to risk hiring you.

02:33.211 --> 02:36.947
Syd, I got dumped by my fiancé
on the red carpet,

02:36.981 --> 02:39.033
the same week my show got cancelled.

02:39.068 --> 02:40.383
So, yeah, I lost it.

02:40.418 --> 02:43.520
Does everyone forget that
I showed up for 15-hour days

02:43.554 --> 02:46.156
- every day for eight years?
- Yes, they forget.

02:46.190 --> 02:48.091
But, breaking into your ex-fiancé's house

02:48.126 --> 02:49.259
and lighting his bed on fire,

02:49.293 --> 02:50.260
they remember.

02:50.294 --> 02:51.962
Syd, if I can't act,
what am I supposed to do?

02:52.330 --> 02:53.463
Reach into my bag.

02:53.498 --> 02:54.598
There's a script

02:54.632 --> 02:56.199
by this hot young writer-director.

02:56.234 --> 02:59.496
He wants you. "A Kiss for Murder."

02:59.971 --> 03:01.538
They want me to play the P.I.?

03:01.572 --> 03:02.539
This is your ticket back.

03:02.573 --> 03:05.775
But you absolutely
cannot screw this up, Sam,

03:05.810 --> 03:06.877
or you're done.

03:06.911 --> 03:07.978
I'm done screwing up.

03:08.012 --> 03:10.680
In fact, I'm going to be
the best private investigator

03:10.715 --> 03:12.215
to hit the screen in decades,

03:12.250 --> 03:14.351
friggin' Oscar-worthy.

03:16.921 --> 03:19.389
Syd, didn't you used to date a P.I.?

03:24.662 --> 03:26.363
I love the view.

03:26.397 --> 03:28.734
It's like being god
looking down from Mt. Olympus.

03:29.433 --> 03:31.902
I prefer the street, myself.

03:31.936 --> 03:33.703
That's why I hired you, Mr. Valetik.

03:33.738 --> 03:36.806
So, have you found
my stolen Margatti Supercar?

03:36.841 --> 03:38.475
As a matter of fact, I did.

03:38.509 --> 03:39.976
The thief was keeping it

03:40.011 --> 03:41.757
in a storage space in Long Beach.

03:41.791 --> 03:43.480
He paid cash. Nearly untraceable.

03:43.514 --> 03:44.548
Do you know who took it?

03:44.582 --> 03:45.982
Yeah.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.150
You did.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.251
Me?

03:48.286 --> 03:49.920
Why would I steal my own car?

03:49.954 --> 03:50.887
I asked myself the same thing.

03:50.922 --> 03:52.756
Guy's rich, doesn't need
the insurance money.

03:52.790 --> 03:54.257
But then...

03:54.292 --> 03:57.494
then I noticed the damage
to the front end.

03:57.528 --> 03:59.863
You reported the car stolen
the afternoon of May 9th.

03:59.897 --> 04:01.765
Where were you that morning at 2:19 A.M.?

04:01.799 --> 04:02.832
I was home, asleep.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.401
Oh, I checked flight records.

04:04.435 --> 04:07.689
Your private jet landed
at Burbank at 1:57 A.M.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.607
You know what happened 20 minutes later?

04:10.641 --> 04:12.275
An unidentified motorist

04:12.309 --> 04:14.210
struck and killed Dean Copeland.

04:14.245 --> 04:15.651
He was 17 years old,

04:15.686 --> 04:17.846
in a hit and run
less than three miles away.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.070
Hey, pal, I don't know what you're thi...

04:19.095 --> 04:20.048
I'm not your pal.

04:20.084 --> 04:21.284
You couldn't get the car fixed

04:21.317 --> 04:22.352
without attracting attention,

04:22.386 --> 04:23.305
so you hid it.

04:23.339 --> 04:24.721
But you had to keep up appearances.

04:24.755 --> 04:26.066
You had to explain why it was missing.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.124
You even hired a detective
to complete the picture.

04:28.993 --> 04:30.393
Except you hired the wrong one.

04:30.427 --> 04:32.668
John Killen, you are under arrest

04:32.702 --> 04:35.398
for vehicular manslaughter
and felony hit and run.

04:35.432 --> 04:37.033
I swear to God, I will destroy you.

04:37.067 --> 04:38.134
Get in line.

04:38.169 --> 04:39.002
Boys.

04:39.036 --> 04:41.171
You have the right to remain silent.

04:46.744 --> 04:47.695
So, how'd it go?

04:47.729 --> 04:48.912
I don't think Mr. Killen

04:48.946 --> 04:51.047
will be paying the balance of his bill.

04:51.081 --> 04:52.315
You couldn't wait and bust his ass

04:52.349 --> 04:53.550
till after we got the check?

04:53.584 --> 04:55.218
Then maybe we could buy new computers.

04:55.252 --> 04:56.435
What's wrong with the ones we have?

04:56.469 --> 04:57.887
They worked when we got 'em.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.389
Yeah, so,

04:59.423 --> 05:01.224
we got a new missing persons
in the conference room,

05:01.258 --> 05:04.109
and there's someone in your office

05:04.143 --> 05:06.089
who says she's an old friend?

05:09.300 --> 05:10.433
Uh-oh.

05:10.467 --> 05:11.701
Nice to see you too, Eddie.

05:11.735 --> 05:13.369
Really? 'Cause the last time you saw me,

05:13.404 --> 05:14.704
you told me to go to hell.

05:14.738 --> 05:15.959
Looks like you took it to heart.

05:15.993 --> 05:18.341
What do you want, Syd?
I have a meeting waiting.

05:18.375 --> 05:20.009
Remember that favor you owe me?

05:20.044 --> 05:22.445
I was wondering when you'd call that in.

05:22.479 --> 05:23.880
You know my client, Sam Swift?

05:23.914 --> 05:24.847
The tabloid train wreck?

05:24.882 --> 05:27.217
What's the trouble now?
Blackmail? Sex tape?

05:27.251 --> 05:28.284
No. All that's behind her now.

05:28.319 --> 05:30.687
- Then what do you need me for?
- There's this role.

05:30.721 --> 05:33.056
Private investigator. Former cop. Noble.

05:33.090 --> 05:35.458
Fights for the underdog,
used to be the best.

05:35.492 --> 05:36.367
Sound familiar?

05:36.402 --> 05:37.694
A ride along with an actress?

05:37.728 --> 05:39.229
She wants her performance
to be authentic.

05:39.263 --> 05:41.631
Mnh-mnh. I'd rather swallow razor blades.

05:41.665 --> 05:43.433
- Eddie.
- Nope.

05:43.467 --> 05:45.635
Eddie! This is my ask.

05:45.669 --> 05:48.238
Full access to your process
for Sam for a week.

05:48.272 --> 05:50.039
The producers will even pay you.

05:50.074 --> 05:51.708
And from what I hear, you
could probably use the money.

05:51.742 --> 05:52.775
Not that much.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.277
Syd, I take what I do seriously.

05:54.311 --> 05:55.712
All right? The people that come here,

05:55.746 --> 05:56.779
they put their trust in me.

05:56.814 --> 05:59.282
I'm not about to risk
what is left of my business

05:59.316 --> 06:00.883
to babysit a spoiled, overprivileged,

06:00.918 --> 06:02.179
out-of-control ego!

06:04.121 --> 06:05.788
- She's behind me, isn't she?
- Yep.

06:05.823 --> 06:06.956
And I haven't needed a babysitter

06:06.991 --> 06:08.324
since I was 10.

06:08.359 --> 06:09.559
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

06:09.593 --> 06:11.160
At your age, they call them sponsors.

06:11.195 --> 06:13.062
Syd, you didn't tell me he was hilarious.

06:13.929 --> 06:15.832
Sam, Eddie. Eddie, Sam.

06:15.866 --> 06:17.834
Why don't you two get to know each other?

06:17.868 --> 06:19.435
Mm.

06:19.470 --> 06:21.404
You're doing this. Come on, Syd.

06:21.438 --> 06:22.438
And then, we're even.

06:22.473 --> 06:25.241
Oh, and Eddie,
try not to sleep with her, too.

06:26.644 --> 06:30.146
So, I take it you don't like actors.

06:30.180 --> 06:31.447
No, no. I like actors.

06:31.482 --> 06:33.650
Actors are hard-working,
they're talented,

06:33.684 --> 06:35.985
they're under-appreciated and underpaid.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.620
What I don't like are stars.

06:37.655 --> 06:38.755
Oh, come on, Eddie.

06:38.789 --> 06:39.922
Everyone likes stars.

06:39.957 --> 06:41.291
That's why they're stars.

06:41.325 --> 06:42.825
Not me. I've worked for them.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.594
They think because they are
rich and good-looking

06:44.628 --> 06:45.825
that the rules don't apply.

06:45.859 --> 06:47.964
See? That's the genuine
screw-you attitude

06:47.998 --> 06:48.898
that I wanna study.

06:48.932 --> 06:50.633
Hey, she looks just like you.

06:51.535 --> 06:53.303
Uh, missing person
in the conference room's

06:53.337 --> 06:55.038
- still waiting.
- Well, tell him I'll be right there.

06:55.072 --> 06:56.272
- We have a case?!
- No.

06:56.307 --> 06:57.607
<i>I</i> have a potential client.

06:57.641 --> 06:59.064
You can just wait here.

06:59.098 --> 07:00.310
Wait, are you kidding?

07:00.344 --> 07:01.678
I came here to learn, not wait.

07:01.712 --> 07:02.845
This is perfect!

07:02.880 --> 07:04.480
I can be in on an investigation
from the beginning...

07:04.515 --> 07:06.149
get to know how you think, you know,

07:06.183 --> 07:08.651
how you... how you work,
crawl under your skin.

07:08.686 --> 07:10.053
My skin is already crawling.

07:10.087 --> 07:11.164
Wait.

07:13.490 --> 07:16.092
I could've sworn Syd said full access.

07:18.162 --> 07:19.329
Okay, fine.

07:19.363 --> 07:22.298
Here's the rule... no talking.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.167
You want to act? Act invisible.
You're a ghost.

07:24.201 --> 07:25.468
A fly on the wall. You got it?

07:25.502 --> 07:27.136
Invisible ghost fly. Got it.

07:31.008 --> 07:32.542
Uh, boss? Something I should know?

07:32.576 --> 07:34.377
Yeah, I'm gonna need more antacids.

07:34.411 --> 07:36.179
What's the client's name? Karl Rainey.

07:36.213 --> 07:38.348
Please, God. Let this one be simple.

07:38.382 --> 07:39.282
Mm.

07:39.316 --> 07:41.851
What's the rule?
Don't talk. Be invisible.

07:44.588 --> 07:46.656
Mr. Rainey, I'm Eddie Valetik.

07:46.690 --> 07:49.559
- Thanks for coming in.
- Thank you.

07:49.593 --> 07:50.426
I'm sorry, aren't you...

07:50.461 --> 07:51.361
Sam Swift.

07:51.395 --> 07:53.563
I'm observing Mr. Valetik for a new role.

07:53.597 --> 07:55.164
But I... I assure you, Mr. Rainey,

07:55.199 --> 07:57.266
everything you say here
will be confidential.

07:57.301 --> 07:59.796
Now, how can I help you?

08:00.404 --> 08:01.604
It's my daughter.

08:01.638 --> 08:04.540
I think she may have been murdered.

08:08.772 --> 08:17.730
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

08:20.427 --> 08:21.557
This is Lynette.

08:21.592 --> 08:23.599
She's a junior
at the University of Louisville.

08:23.633 --> 08:27.397
She's a great kid,
straight-A student, everything.

08:27.431 --> 08:29.532
Well, what was she doing in L.A.?

08:29.566 --> 08:30.767
She had some interviews

08:30.801 --> 08:32.902
for internships, media companies.

08:32.936 --> 08:34.404
I don't know the names.

08:34.438 --> 08:36.371
She called us when she got
to the rental room

08:36.407 --> 08:37.940
just to let us know she was okay.

08:37.975 --> 08:39.942
She was due back in Kentucky
two days ago.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.544
And we waited at the airport, but...

08:42.578 --> 08:44.747
Well, so, what makes you think
she's been murdered?

08:44.782 --> 08:47.617
We haven't heard a word from her in days.

08:47.651 --> 08:49.385
She knows how we worry.

08:49.420 --> 08:51.287
You contacted the person
she was renting a room from?

08:51.321 --> 08:52.955
The guy said she went out one day

08:52.990 --> 08:54.257
and just never came back.

08:54.291 --> 08:55.625
Left all her stuff.

08:55.659 --> 08:56.592
Have you spoken to the police?

08:56.627 --> 08:58.161
They took a statement.

08:58.195 --> 08:59.595
Said they'd be in touch

08:59.630 --> 09:01.117
when they assigned a detective.

09:01.152 --> 09:03.266
I don't want to wait.

09:03.300 --> 09:04.356
That's smart.

09:04.390 --> 09:06.502
The first 48 hours
are the most important.

09:06.537 --> 09:08.744
Mr. Rainey, does Lynette
know anyone in L.A.?

09:08.778 --> 09:10.350
Maybe friends, relatives?

09:10.384 --> 09:11.374
No.

09:11.408 --> 09:13.276
Oh, and when I went to the rental,

09:13.310 --> 09:14.944
I found this.

09:15.946 --> 09:18.147
She never goes anywhere
without that thing.

09:18.182 --> 09:19.615
I thought maybe there was a clue in there

09:19.650 --> 09:20.783
about where she went, but...

09:20.818 --> 09:22.265
It's locked.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.519
Yeah, and I don't have the passcode.

09:23.554 --> 09:26.299
Something's happened to her.
Something bad.

09:27.323 --> 09:29.157
Can you please help us
find out what it is?

09:29.192 --> 09:30.459
Mr. Rainey...

09:30.493 --> 09:32.060
Don't worry, Mr. Rainey.
We're on the case.

09:32.095 --> 09:34.096
If your daughter's out there,
we'll find her.

09:34.130 --> 09:35.330
I promise.

09:38.801 --> 09:40.569
We'll be in touch.

09:44.140 --> 09:46.308
What part of invisible
do you not understand?!

09:46.342 --> 09:47.976
You got to admit, those were
some pretty good questions.

09:48.011 --> 09:49.444
But then, you know, I've done

09:49.479 --> 09:51.246
hundreds of those interview
scenes on the show.

09:51.281 --> 09:52.447
Except this wasn't a scene!

09:52.482 --> 09:53.415
He's not an actor.

09:53.449 --> 09:54.414
He's a real father,

09:54.448 --> 09:55.751
whose real daughter is missing!

09:55.785 --> 09:58.004
Yeah, my point exactly. He was hurting.

09:58.038 --> 10:00.255
He needed someone to tell him
that it'll all be okay.

10:00.290 --> 10:01.923
Except we don't know
it'll be okay, do we?

10:01.958 --> 10:03.358
His daughter may in fact be dead.

10:03.393 --> 10:05.494
It's very possible we may never find her.

10:05.528 --> 10:07.996
In this business, you never
promise anyone anything.

10:08.031 --> 10:09.431
Well, no wonder business sucks.

10:09.465 --> 10:11.199
Why would anyone want to hire you?

10:11.234 --> 10:12.634
Because I tell them the truth,

10:12.669 --> 10:13.602
that we will do our best.

10:13.636 --> 10:15.948
But you? You promised we'd find his girl.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.873
So, now, I have to deliver.

10:17.907 --> 10:19.441
Well, I'm the one who made the promise.

10:19.475 --> 10:20.976
So <i>we</i> have to deliver.

10:21.010 --> 10:22.544
Come on, it'll be great.
It'll be like we're a team.

10:22.578 --> 10:24.313
We're not a team.

10:26.816 --> 10:29.184
- Berto.
- Yo, what's up?

10:29.218 --> 10:30.485
Here.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.120
Subject's phone is locked.

10:32.155 --> 10:33.388
See if you can crack it.

10:33.423 --> 10:34.823
And this is what we know about her.

10:34.857 --> 10:36.558
I want you to do
a full social media workup.

10:36.592 --> 10:37.592
I want to know who she was talking with,

10:37.627 --> 10:39.661
who her followers are,
any recent unusual activity.

10:39.696 --> 10:41.229
- Got it?
- Okay, uh...

10:41.264 --> 10:42.130
but it looks like we got

10:42.165 --> 10:43.265
a lot of unusual activity right here.

10:43.299 --> 10:46.401
Eddie, where are you going?
To Lynette's rental room?

10:46.436 --> 10:47.672
Will you hold up?!

10:49.339 --> 10:51.206
I gotta ask you, why are you here?

10:51.240 --> 10:52.374
After playing a cop for eight years,

10:52.408 --> 10:53.575
I'd think you'd have this down.

10:53.609 --> 10:54.843
Cop, yes.

10:54.877 --> 10:56.144
P.I., no.

10:56.179 --> 10:57.979
You work outside the system.

10:58.014 --> 11:00.582
You're like the modern-day
cowboys of the law.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.818
And as an actor, the more real I can be,

11:02.852 --> 11:04.152
the more the audience

11:04.187 --> 11:06.388
understands and relates to my character.

11:06.422 --> 11:08.190
It's all about finding authenticity.

11:08.224 --> 11:09.591
Like on your show, "Hot Suspect"?

11:09.625 --> 11:10.630
- Exactly.
- Really?

11:10.664 --> 11:11.893
Because none of the cops I know

11:11.928 --> 11:13.528
wear designer clothes
and five-inch heels.

11:17.567 --> 11:18.714
What are you? Invisible.

11:18.748 --> 11:20.335
And if you say anything? You'll shoot me.

11:23.106 --> 11:24.506
Like I told her father,

11:24.540 --> 11:26.241
she booked a room for a week.

11:26.275 --> 11:27.709
And after about three days,

11:27.744 --> 11:29.878
she took off and never came back.

11:29.912 --> 11:33.615
- Sorry, do I know you?
- No.

11:33.649 --> 11:36.585
Now did she, uh, tell you
why she was in town?

11:36.619 --> 11:39.020
Um, I try to leave people alone.

11:39.055 --> 11:39.969
They pay for the room,

11:39.994 --> 11:41.423
- not for my company.
- Yeah.

11:41.457 --> 11:43.637
Did you notice
anything out of the ordinary?

11:43.671 --> 11:46.027
Any recent visitors, unusual activity,

11:46.062 --> 11:48.463
- nervous behavior?
- No.

11:48.498 --> 11:50.932
She seemed like an ordinary...

11:50.967 --> 11:52.467
college girl.

11:52.502 --> 11:55.871
- Can you, uh, excuse me for one second?
- Mm-hmm.

11:57.473 --> 11:59.574
- What the hell are you doing?
- You told me not to talk.

11:59.609 --> 12:01.109
So instead you thought
we should play charades?

12:01.144 --> 12:02.310
I know you don't respect me,

12:02.345 --> 12:03.578
but I'm actually good at what I do.

12:03.613 --> 12:05.447
- Annoying me?
- Acting.

12:05.481 --> 12:06.501
I've studied thousands

12:06.526 --> 12:07.783
of subtle physical shifts...

12:07.817 --> 12:09.885
...that convey a character's
emotional state.

12:09.919 --> 12:12.587
Look. See how his shoulders
are around his ears?

12:12.622 --> 12:13.922
He's protecting his jugular.

12:13.956 --> 12:15.657
People do that
when they're hiding something.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.225
And if his eyes indicate anything,

12:17.260 --> 12:19.428
it has to do with that room over there.

12:19.462 --> 12:21.129
Eddie, no joke.

12:25.435 --> 12:27.063
Sorry about that.

12:27.637 --> 12:30.605
Um, so, which room...
which room was Lynette's?

12:30.640 --> 12:33.408
- The guest bed, down the hall.
- Hmm.

12:33.443 --> 12:35.477
You mind if we take a look?

12:38.347 --> 12:39.748
Nothing!

12:39.782 --> 12:41.616
I could've sworn...

12:44.620 --> 12:46.388
That's a cute bear.

12:48.191 --> 12:49.958
What's his name?

12:53.062 --> 12:54.129
Pervy?

12:56.566 --> 12:57.632
Where is she?

12:57.667 --> 12:58.800
What'd you do to her? Nothing!

12:58.835 --> 12:59.935
I just... I just watched her!

12:59.969 --> 13:02.003
That's all I ever do. I just
make videos and I watch.

13:02.038 --> 13:03.004
I don't know what happened to her,

13:03.039 --> 13:04.773
but I swear to God
I had nothing to do with it!

13:04.807 --> 13:06.107
I want the files.

13:07.343 --> 13:08.376
All of them.

13:08.411 --> 13:09.277
There she is.

13:09.312 --> 13:11.279
I told you he was hiding something.

13:11.314 --> 13:13.315
- Admit it, you're impressed.
- You are aware

13:13.349 --> 13:15.183
I would've searched her room
anyway, right?

13:15.218 --> 13:16.518
Wow. You kick puppies, too?

13:17.720 --> 13:18.741
What are we looking for, anyway?

13:18.775 --> 13:20.222
What all detectives look for...

13:20.256 --> 13:23.692
something out of the ordinary,
something unusual.

13:23.726 --> 13:24.931
Like that.

13:24.965 --> 13:27.696
She's looking at the back
of a local weekly,

13:27.730 --> 13:28.663
a classified section.

13:28.698 --> 13:30.499
So, who'd she call?

13:30.533 --> 13:31.533
Well, we need to enhance it.

13:31.567 --> 13:34.202
You can't enhance video resolution.

13:34.237 --> 13:36.037
It's scientifically impossible.

13:36.072 --> 13:37.572
Our show did it all the time.

13:37.607 --> 13:39.274
And each time, it is moronic.

13:39.308 --> 13:41.476
Would you like to know how
we do it in the real world?

13:43.012 --> 13:45.013
Watch her hand move, all right?

13:45.047 --> 13:46.681
See that? Now you just follow the pattern

13:46.716 --> 13:48.250
on the face of the phone. I see it.

13:48.284 --> 13:52.320
2-1-3-5-5-5.

13:54.290 --> 13:57.726
0-1-5-2.

13:59.595 --> 14:01.363
An escort service?

14:01.397 --> 14:03.598
Wait, Lynette was a good girl
just out of farm country.

14:03.633 --> 14:04.633
She was a straight-A student.

14:04.667 --> 14:06.668
What would she be doing
calling an escort service?

14:06.702 --> 14:08.770
Maybe her dad didn't know her
as well as he thought.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.572
But now...

14:10.606 --> 14:12.040
we know where to find her.

14:12.074 --> 14:14.142
Wait, no we don't.
There was no an address.

14:15.745 --> 14:17.846
Oh, wait. You know this place?
You seem shocked.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.495
I mean, I figured,
you know, a guy like you...

14:20.529 --> 14:22.522
good-looking, employed...
wouldn't need to...

14:22.556 --> 14:24.386
What? Pay for it?

14:25.555 --> 14:27.522
It's sad, right?

14:27.557 --> 14:31.626
But, you know, sometimes,
being a modern-day cowboy,

14:31.661 --> 14:32.727
I get so lonely.

14:32.762 --> 14:35.697
And I just need a little warmth,

14:35.731 --> 14:38.533
the comforting touch of a woman.

14:38.568 --> 14:39.886
Yeah.

14:42.772 --> 14:45.053
That, or maybe I know it
because I'm a P.I.,

14:45.087 --> 14:47.186
and it's not the first time
a girl's run away to there.

14:47.221 --> 14:48.777
Oh...

14:48.811 --> 14:50.278
Right.

14:51.847 --> 14:54.049
Seriously? Here? It's
an expensive neighborhood.

14:54.083 --> 14:55.417
I actually know three producers

14:55.451 --> 14:56.618
that live up the street.

14:56.652 --> 14:58.753
Oh, hey. Maybe you'll
see one of them inside.

14:58.788 --> 14:59.788
That'd be awkward.

15:06.446 --> 15:08.330
Yeah, she came here last week.

15:08.364 --> 15:09.998
Not about a job.

15:10.032 --> 15:11.733
Well, what then?

15:11.767 --> 15:12.834
Listen, Eddie,

15:12.868 --> 15:14.836
our friendship only goes so far.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.972
Yeah, well, what can you tell me, Mads?

15:17.006 --> 15:18.406
She was looking for someone.

15:18.441 --> 15:19.541
Ricky Jenson.

15:19.575 --> 15:22.611
Local muscle we sometimes use
to protect the girls.

15:22.645 --> 15:24.412
He's street, knows how to hurt people.

15:24.447 --> 15:25.747
Not someone your gal should know.

15:25.781 --> 15:27.082
- What'd she want from him?
- Wouldn't say,

15:27.116 --> 15:28.750
so I chose to be unhelpful.

15:28.784 --> 15:30.318
Well, maybe you can be helpful to me.

15:30.353 --> 15:31.653
You know where I can find this Ricky guy?

15:33.456 --> 15:35.090
I need him, I call my people,

15:35.124 --> 15:36.491
he shows up.

15:36.525 --> 15:39.294
But, uh, try
the Crown Ridge Hotel downtown.

15:43.699 --> 15:45.433
So, what I don't understand is

15:45.468 --> 15:47.602
why is a straight-A student
from the Midwest

15:47.637 --> 15:49.704
trying to track down
some L.A. street thug?

15:49.739 --> 15:51.139
I don't know, but whatever
happened to Lynette,

15:51.173 --> 15:52.140
this Ricky guy's involved.

15:53.743 --> 15:54.876
I just got off with Lynette's father.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.544
He's never heard of Ricky Jensen.

15:56.579 --> 15:58.480
So I ran a search on
all her social media.

15:58.514 --> 16:00.715
There's no mention of
a Ricky Jensen in any of it.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.217
It's all about school activity.

16:02.251 --> 16:03.718
Nothing about a media internship

16:03.753 --> 16:05.787
- or why she was in L.A.
- How about her phone?

16:05.821 --> 16:08.456
With a million combinations,
that can take a couple days.

16:08.491 --> 16:10.792
But I was able to pull up
a mugshot of Ricky Jensen

16:10.826 --> 16:11.826
from public records.

16:11.861 --> 16:13.928
Texting that to you now.

16:14.897 --> 16:16.231
Maybe he's out.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.254
Lucky us.

16:21.837 --> 16:23.571
You're actually gonna pick the lock?

16:23.606 --> 16:24.739
I never got to do that.

16:24.774 --> 16:26.541
We always had to wait for a warrant.

16:26.575 --> 16:28.843
You do know you weren't a real cop?

16:28.878 --> 16:31.146
And yet, I was voted
Most Trusted Cop in America

16:31.180 --> 16:33.815
by <i>People</i> magazine two years running.

16:41.624 --> 16:43.391
What are we looking for?

16:43.426 --> 16:45.226
Anything that could give us
a bead on Lynette.

16:45.261 --> 16:46.828
Got it.

16:46.862 --> 16:49.030
Metaphorical bread crumbs.

16:49.065 --> 16:51.032
Looking for a trail of... blood!

16:51.067 --> 16:52.434
Oh, my God. That's a lot of blood!

16:54.870 --> 16:55.904
Ricky Jensen.

16:56.806 --> 16:58.073
Guess he was home.

17:04.482 --> 17:06.784
I'm guessing this is
your first real dead body?

17:06.818 --> 17:08.419
Yeah, the ones I'm used to seeing

17:08.453 --> 17:10.154
usually get up and go to lunch

17:10.188 --> 17:11.321
when the director yells, "Cut."

17:11.356 --> 17:13.324
Valetik!

17:13.358 --> 17:15.992
Which dubious event
do you wanna explain first?

17:16.027 --> 17:18.362
How you just happened
to stumble on to a dead guy,

17:18.396 --> 17:20.330
or what Ms. Clickbait
is doing at my crime scene?

17:20.365 --> 17:21.464
Actually, I'm trying to get away

17:21.499 --> 17:23.972
from the whole, you know,
drunk, no underwear thing.

17:24.007 --> 17:25.102
That's why I'm following Eddie.

17:25.136 --> 17:27.271
It's for a new role. I'm Sam Swift.

17:27.305 --> 17:28.462
Yeah, I know who you are.

17:28.497 --> 17:30.174
You wanna tell me about the dead guy?

17:30.208 --> 17:31.308
His name came up on a job,

17:31.343 --> 17:32.961
so I came by to ask a few questions.

17:32.961 --> 17:34.528
- Never got the chance.
- What's the job?

17:34.563 --> 17:36.203
- Missing person... check.
- Simple background check.

17:36.238 --> 17:38.466
Really? Background check.
That's what you're going with?

17:38.500 --> 17:39.767
Yeah, for now.

17:39.801 --> 17:40.968
Oh, my God.

17:41.003 --> 17:42.136
You're Sam Swift.

17:42.170 --> 17:44.538
I am a huge, huge fan.

17:44.573 --> 17:46.974
I love, love, love your show.

17:47.009 --> 17:49.043
"I'm greedy too. For justice."

17:50.012 --> 17:51.961
I'm sorry. Sorry.

17:51.995 --> 17:53.581
Sam, this is Mick English.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.449
He's an M.E. with
the L.A. Coroner's office.

17:55.484 --> 17:58.252
Ah, the true unsung heroes of justice.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.721
That's brilliant.

18:00.756 --> 18:02.957
You know, back when you were
doing all the...

18:02.991 --> 18:04.425
I just thought the only way I'd meet you

18:04.459 --> 18:05.459
was on my table.

18:05.494 --> 18:06.961
But here you are, alive!

18:06.995 --> 18:09.096
Yay!

18:09.131 --> 18:11.165
So what the hell are you doing
with this moody stiff here?

18:11.199 --> 18:12.900
She's following him for a new role.

18:12.934 --> 18:14.301
Hey, Mick, it's her first dead body.

18:14.336 --> 18:16.637
Why don't you show her how a real
crime-scene examination's done?

18:16.671 --> 18:18.105
- Really?
- Are you kidding?

18:18.140 --> 18:19.140
I'd be honored.

18:23.612 --> 18:24.578
So?

18:24.613 --> 18:26.814
Long, long story, Chris.

18:26.848 --> 18:28.182
I'll tell you about it later.

18:28.216 --> 18:30.084
Tomorrow night? My date cancelled.

18:30.118 --> 18:31.018
Happy to sub in.

18:31.053 --> 18:33.120
Well, until then,
whatever you're working,

18:33.155 --> 18:34.588
you should move her off this case.

18:34.623 --> 18:35.790
- Why?
- Your dead guy?

18:35.824 --> 18:37.491
He's got a rap sheet a mile long.

18:37.526 --> 18:39.760
Word is he worked for Deacon.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.344
Last thing you need

18:44.378 --> 18:47.034
is some fake cop getting you real killed.

18:49.204 --> 18:52.673
All right, Detective McNair.

18:52.707 --> 18:54.108
From the looks of these wounds,

18:54.142 --> 18:55.910
where do you suppose
the shooter was standing?

18:57.846 --> 18:59.113
Trick question.

18:59.147 --> 19:00.614
There's powder marks on his shirt.

19:00.649 --> 19:01.615
He was shot point blank.

19:01.650 --> 19:03.451
And he probably knew
the person who shot him

19:03.485 --> 19:05.186
to let him get that close.

19:05.220 --> 19:06.487
Well, uh...

19:06.521 --> 19:08.489
Um, very good, yes.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.024
Well, you can't make 200 episodes

19:10.058 --> 19:11.959
without picking up a thing
or two along the way.

19:11.993 --> 19:12.993
Well...

19:13.028 --> 19:16.330
let's see what secrets
these wounds have to offer.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.365
Hey, Mick, can you tell
how old a tattoo is

19:18.400 --> 19:19.700
by looking at it?

19:19.734 --> 19:21.168
- You mean that one?
- Yeah.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.137
Yeah, it's much more faded
than the others.

19:23.171 --> 19:25.139
I'd say it's at least five years older

19:25.173 --> 19:25.973
than all of these.

19:26.007 --> 19:26.907
Huh.

19:26.942 --> 19:28.042
We gotta go. Ooh!

19:28.076 --> 19:28.909
Oh!

19:30.212 --> 19:32.680
- Where are we going?
- I'm taking you home.

19:32.714 --> 19:35.382
You can follow me on another
case, just not this one.

19:35.417 --> 19:37.184
That what your cop girlfriend
told you to say?

19:37.219 --> 19:38.886
- Who? Detective Rollins?
- Yeah.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.055
- You two got a thing going on.
- No.

19:41.089 --> 19:43.324
Look, my sex-vibe radar is infallible.

19:43.358 --> 19:44.758
Remember? Body language.

19:44.793 --> 19:45.860
Well, it's wrong this time.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.528
Okay, it's wrong this time.

19:47.562 --> 19:49.880
Sam, stop. This is serious.

19:50.532 --> 19:52.533
You ever hear of a guy called Deacon?

19:52.567 --> 19:55.336
Wait, cops on my show
used to whisper about him.

19:55.370 --> 19:57.338
Said he controlled half of L.A.

19:57.372 --> 19:58.272
But no one knows who he is.

19:58.306 --> 20:00.241
That's who Ricky Jensen
was working for...

20:00.275 --> 20:02.776
the most dangerous guy in the city.

20:02.811 --> 20:04.845
This isn't just
a missing persons anymore.

20:04.880 --> 20:06.213
This is organized crime, murder.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.748
And I don't want to see you...

20:08.402 --> 20:09.603
get hurt.

20:10.218 --> 20:12.086
Or worse.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.238
That's sweet, Eddie.

20:15.157 --> 20:17.191
But I'm pretty sure
that Deacon isn't our killer.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.127
I know why Lynette
was looking for Ricky Jensen.

20:22.664 --> 20:25.032
Childhood sweethearts.
So, how'd you know?

20:25.066 --> 20:27.268
A tattoo with both of their initials

20:27.302 --> 20:28.369
over Ricky's heart.

20:28.403 --> 20:31.305
It's classic, a tragic love story.

20:31.339 --> 20:33.440
"Romeo and Juliet," "West Side Story,"

20:33.475 --> 20:35.376
where... where the good girl
falls for the bad boy

20:35.410 --> 20:36.710
and hides it from her parents.

20:36.745 --> 20:38.279
It's a total Lifetime movie!

20:38.313 --> 20:42.116
Ricky was in Tinsel Town
surrounded by temptation.

20:42.150 --> 20:43.784
Lynette finds out
he's fallen for someone new.

20:43.818 --> 20:46.820
She comes out here to end it
by killing him.

20:46.855 --> 20:47.988
Wait, can I see Lynette's phone?

20:49.324 --> 20:51.325
- What are you doing?
- Being an actor,

20:51.359 --> 20:53.994
putting myself in the character's shoes.

20:54.029 --> 20:56.964
I'm a lovesick girl,
hiding my true feelings.

20:56.998 --> 20:59.634
I'd want something to remind me
of my secret love

20:59.669 --> 21:00.843
every day.

21:00.877 --> 21:02.836
Like making my phone password...

21:02.871 --> 21:03.904
Your boyfriend's birthday.

21:06.441 --> 21:07.775
How did you know his birthdate?

21:07.809 --> 21:09.076
Mick's M.E. report.

21:09.110 --> 21:10.715
Hey, I'm kinda good at this!

21:10.750 --> 21:12.796
- She kinda is.
- Yeah, yeah.

21:12.830 --> 21:15.916
Except there's one giant flaw
in your theory.

21:15.951 --> 21:17.851
Lynette didn't kill Ricky.

21:17.886 --> 21:19.286
The hotel clerk told the cops

21:19.321 --> 21:20.588
Lynette was there two days ago.

21:20.622 --> 21:21.989
I've been around a lot of bodies,

21:22.023 --> 21:23.357
and Ricky's been dead longer than that.

21:23.391 --> 21:25.025
He was already gone when she got there,

21:25.060 --> 21:26.827
which means there's
something else going on here.

21:26.861 --> 21:28.329
Someone reset the phone.

21:28.363 --> 21:30.464
It's been totally wiped...
no photos, no e-mails.

21:30.498 --> 21:31.799
Why would Lynette reset her phone?

21:31.833 --> 21:33.100
Maybe she had something on there

21:33.134 --> 21:34.535
- she didn't want anyone to see.
- Hang on.

21:34.569 --> 21:35.836
It looks like some texts came in

21:35.870 --> 21:36.870
after the phone was reset.

21:40.075 --> 21:41.842
"I got what you asked,
but it's gonna cost.

21:41.876 --> 21:42.710
You have the money?"

21:42.744 --> 21:43.877
"Yes. Where do we meet?"

21:43.912 --> 21:45.546
"Pier. One hour."

21:45.580 --> 21:47.281
Look at the timestamp.

21:47.315 --> 21:49.594
It's right after she saw Ricky,
the day she disappeared.

21:49.628 --> 21:51.439
"I got what you asked."

21:51.474 --> 21:53.147
What do you think she meant?

21:53.181 --> 21:55.122
There's only one way to find out.

21:57.264 --> 22:00.221
_

22:03.094 --> 22:05.094
_

22:05.246 --> 22:07.618
_

22:09.942 --> 22:13.791
_

22:16.444 --> 22:18.379
That's our guy.

22:18.413 --> 22:20.180
Stay here.

22:20.215 --> 22:22.875
Are you kidding?
This is why I'm following you.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.752
To fully immerse myself
in moments like this.

22:24.786 --> 22:26.153
It's too dangerous.

22:26.187 --> 22:28.088
You're gonna have to "immerse" from afar.

22:28.123 --> 22:29.423
Here.

22:29.457 --> 22:30.858
Watch through the binoculars.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.793
But above all, you stay.

22:40.869 --> 22:42.169
What the...

22:42.203 --> 22:43.337
Did you just take my picture?

22:43.371 --> 22:44.204
Oh, yeah, yeah.

22:44.239 --> 22:45.306
On Lynette Rainey's phone,

22:45.340 --> 22:47.074
Which makes you a prime suspect
in her disappearance.

22:47.108 --> 22:48.409
If the cops get ahold of this...

22:48.443 --> 22:49.376
Whoa.

22:49.411 --> 22:50.644
Don't make this worse, kid.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.680
You got the wrong idea.

22:52.714 --> 22:53.947
I don't even know her.

22:53.982 --> 22:55.282
You met with her a few days back.

22:55.317 --> 22:57.117
That was strictly a business transaction.

22:57.152 --> 22:59.086
- What'd she want?
- First...

22:59.120 --> 23:00.863
who's your friend?

23:07.429 --> 23:10.130
Next time, I'm just cuffing
you to the steering wheel.

23:10.165 --> 23:11.899
Eddie, I didn't know you were kinky.

23:11.933 --> 23:13.701
What did Lynette want
from that guy, anyway?

23:13.735 --> 23:15.437
So Lynette finds Ricky dead,

23:15.472 --> 23:17.538
and the first thing she does
is she texts this thug

23:17.572 --> 23:19.239
for a burner phone and a gun.

23:21.076 --> 23:22.443
She's planning on going after

23:22.477 --> 23:23.711
her boyfriend's murderer.

23:23.745 --> 23:25.781
She's gonna get herself killed!
We have to find her!

23:25.816 --> 23:27.214
Well, we don't have a lot to go on.

23:27.248 --> 23:29.216
Well, what about
the burner phone he sold her?

23:29.250 --> 23:31.051
You got the number.
We can trace it, right?

23:31.086 --> 23:33.660
Another TV fantasy trope. No, it's not.

23:33.694 --> 23:34.832
Cops can triangulate

23:34.867 --> 23:37.191
- cellphone calls to cell towers.
- Yeah, well, I'm not a cop.

23:37.225 --> 23:38.716
And even a cop would need a warrant,

23:38.751 --> 23:40.494
which in real life,
it takes a helluva lot longer

23:40.528 --> 23:41.562
than a commercial break.

23:42.921 --> 23:43.997
I can get it traced.

23:44.032 --> 23:46.400
You? Ha. No, you can't.

23:46.434 --> 23:47.401
Oh, yes I can.

23:47.435 --> 23:48.502
I have a friend.

23:48.536 --> 23:49.670
Oh, really? You have a friend.

23:49.704 --> 23:50.938
What kind of friend do you have?

23:50.972 --> 23:52.306
Uh, he was a consultant on my show,

23:52.340 --> 23:54.104
who works in Homeland Security.

23:54.138 --> 23:55.409
We became close.

23:55.443 --> 23:57.857
Very, very, <i>very</i> close.

23:57.892 --> 23:59.137
He can track it easily.

23:59.171 --> 24:02.082
Forest? Hi. It's Sam.

24:02.117 --> 24:03.984
Oh, I know. I miss you, too.

24:04.018 --> 24:06.420
Listen, I have a small favor to ask.

24:06.454 --> 24:08.422
Can you track a phone signal for me?

24:10.291 --> 24:11.425
This is it.

24:11.459 --> 24:13.427
Forest says that the burner signal's

24:13.461 --> 24:14.695
coming from inside.

24:14.729 --> 24:15.950
Does your friend know he broke

24:15.985 --> 24:16.964
about 11 federal

24:16.989 --> 24:18.465
- and state privacy laws?
- Oh, please.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.641
You're just mad that I have

24:19.666 --> 24:21.034
- better sources than you.
- No.

24:21.069 --> 24:23.504
I'm mad, because you think
the rules don't apply to you.

24:23.538 --> 24:24.605
Not all rules.

24:24.639 --> 24:25.606
I just ignore the stupid ones.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.441
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
gotten to where I am.

24:28.977 --> 24:30.477
Where are you going? Stay here.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.312
Have you met me?

24:55.270 --> 24:56.582
Eddie. Come here.

24:58.316 --> 24:59.573
Take a look at this.

25:02.177 --> 25:05.078
Drop the gun if you wanna live.

25:05.113 --> 25:08.015
Maybe I should've stayed in the car.

25:12.329 --> 25:13.889
Easy. Easy, Lynette.

25:13.923 --> 25:15.564
We're on your side.

25:17.166 --> 25:18.633
Wait.

25:18.796 --> 25:20.263
Are you Samantha Swift?

25:20.298 --> 25:22.171
From TV?

25:22.867 --> 25:24.768
Oddly enough, yes.

25:24.802 --> 25:26.103
And I swear, we're the good guys.

25:27.296 --> 25:29.673
When his dad abandoned him, Ricky was 16.

25:29.707 --> 25:31.408
He did what he had to do to survive.

25:31.442 --> 25:32.437
A few months ago,

25:32.471 --> 25:33.910
we decided we were gonna run away,

25:33.945 --> 25:35.278
start over together.

25:35.313 --> 25:37.647
- That man he was working for...
- Deacon?

25:37.682 --> 25:40.617
You don't leave his organization alive.

25:40.651 --> 25:43.353
But Ricky figured out
Deacon's real identity.

25:43.388 --> 25:45.622
He thought that unmasking him
was the only way out.

25:45.656 --> 25:48.158
But he knew he needed evidence.

25:48.192 --> 25:49.359
What evidence?

25:49.394 --> 25:50.694
Financial records

25:50.728 --> 25:53.096
covering all Deacon's illegal deals,

25:53.131 --> 25:54.331
kept in a cabinet safe

25:54.365 --> 25:55.966
in his basement wine cellar.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.888
Ricky found the combination.

26:00.238 --> 26:01.772
All he had to do was get those books,

26:01.806 --> 26:03.282
and we'd be free.

26:03.307 --> 26:05.005
Only, Deacon found him first.

26:05.912 --> 26:07.711
- Did Ricky tell you who Deacon is?
- No.

26:07.745 --> 26:10.213
He thought it would put me
in too much danger.

26:10.248 --> 26:12.482
But they know about me now.

26:12.517 --> 26:13.950
They're gonna come after me.

26:13.985 --> 26:15.185
We need to go to the police.

26:15.219 --> 26:16.319
You don't get it.

26:16.354 --> 26:17.487
He owns the police.

26:18.756 --> 26:20.938
There's only one thing I can do.

26:21.659 --> 26:23.860
Find him and kill him myself.

26:23.895 --> 26:26.496
Lynette, if you go after him,
they'll kill you.

26:26.531 --> 26:28.605
I'm gonna end up dead anyway.

26:28.639 --> 26:29.699
At least this way,

26:29.734 --> 26:31.701
that man pays for what he did to Ricky!

26:31.736 --> 26:32.836
What about your family?

26:32.870 --> 26:33.837
They're worried about you.

26:33.871 --> 26:35.038
What are you talking about?

26:35.073 --> 26:36.840
Your dad. He hired us to find you.

26:36.874 --> 26:38.408
That's not possible.

26:38.443 --> 26:39.623
My dad's dead.

26:40.244 --> 26:41.645
Oh, God. We led them here!

26:42.680 --> 26:44.147
That way, that way!

26:49.420 --> 26:50.754
You trapped us!

26:50.788 --> 26:52.556
Get down. Get over there. Get over there.

27:03.101 --> 27:04.401
Stop. It's him!

27:04.435 --> 27:05.569
- Who?
- The fake dad!

27:05.603 --> 27:07.370
Okay, listen. Shh.

27:09.474 --> 27:11.838
What the hell?

27:12.443 --> 27:14.444
- Turn that thing off!
- I'm trying!

27:21.619 --> 27:23.286
The man's an agent. Come on.

27:23.321 --> 27:24.721
- What?
- Get up. Get up. Let's go.

27:24.755 --> 27:26.223
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

27:30.128 --> 27:31.461
Go, go, go!

27:50.611 --> 27:52.716
All right. I think we're good.

27:52.750 --> 27:53.950
You think we're good?

27:53.985 --> 27:56.052
You almost got me killed.

27:56.087 --> 27:58.188
Hey, Lynette. Wait!

27:59.490 --> 28:00.590
Lynette, wait!

28:00.625 --> 28:01.992
Hey, hey. Don't do this alone.

28:02.026 --> 28:03.927
Let us help you. I've seen how you help.

28:03.961 --> 28:05.595
I'm gonna finish this on my own.

28:13.838 --> 28:14.938
Well, at least we found her.

28:14.972 --> 28:16.006
Yeah.

28:16.040 --> 28:17.107
I should've seen it.

28:18.543 --> 28:19.776
You know why I didn't?

28:19.810 --> 28:21.278
Because I was keeping an eye on <i>you</i>

28:21.312 --> 28:22.512
instead of the client.

28:22.547 --> 28:23.513
And what the hell were you thinking,

28:23.548 --> 28:25.515
answering your phone
in the middle of a gunfight?

28:25.550 --> 28:28.118
I was trying to silence it
so we didn't get shot.

28:28.690 --> 28:31.955
It was Syd, by the way.

28:31.989 --> 28:34.124
When I didn't answer, she texted.

28:34.158 --> 28:36.526
The financiers backed out on my movie.

28:40.739 --> 28:41.898
Great, great.

28:41.933 --> 28:43.633
So all this time with you on my heels,

28:43.668 --> 28:45.001
and I don't even get paid?

28:45.036 --> 28:46.469
I knew this was a lousy idea.

28:47.872 --> 28:49.606
Seriously?

28:49.640 --> 28:52.342
After everything,
that's what you care about?

28:54.045 --> 28:55.512
You know, Eddie, you really put the dick

28:55.546 --> 28:57.010
in detective.

29:26.611 --> 29:27.577
Hey.

29:30.181 --> 29:32.048
I liked it better when I was a hero.

29:33.156 --> 29:35.585
- I'm sorry about the movie.
- The movie?

29:35.620 --> 29:36.920
I'm more upset about Lynette.

29:36.954 --> 29:38.521
- Who?
- The missing girl.

29:38.556 --> 29:39.589
Only she wasn't missing.

29:39.624 --> 29:41.491
She was planning to hunt down the man

29:41.525 --> 29:42.644
who killed her fiancé.

29:42.678 --> 29:43.893
But now his people are after her,

29:43.928 --> 29:45.428
and she's gonna get herself killed!

29:45.463 --> 29:47.264
Seriously? That's a movie.

29:47.298 --> 29:48.431
Except it's not.

29:48.466 --> 29:50.734
It's real.

29:50.768 --> 29:53.069
And you know, for the first time

29:53.104 --> 29:55.338
in a long, <i>long</i> time,

29:55.373 --> 29:57.811
I felt something real, you know?

29:57.846 --> 29:59.609
Like... like I was actually
helping someone.

29:59.644 --> 30:01.825
Like what I was doing mattered.

30:02.380 --> 30:03.513
And I was good at it.

30:03.547 --> 30:04.481
I'm confused.

30:04.515 --> 30:07.684
Are you saying that
you want to quit acting

30:07.718 --> 30:08.852
and become a P.I. now?

30:08.886 --> 30:10.520
No. No, I just...

30:18.296 --> 30:21.197
The City Clerk's office.

30:22.600 --> 30:23.722
Syd, I gotta go.

30:25.069 --> 30:26.770
I gotta go. I just solved the case.

30:29.362 --> 30:32.397
Eddie? If you're in there,
I need to talk to you!

30:35.650 --> 30:37.501
What?

30:38.221 --> 30:39.889
Is that Detective Rollins?

30:39.923 --> 30:41.991
I knew it. See, my radar is never wrong.

30:42.025 --> 30:43.259
Is that what you came over here
to tell me?

30:43.293 --> 30:45.903
No. I had a revelation... about the case.

30:45.944 --> 30:47.244
There is no case, remember?

30:47.278 --> 30:48.412
It's a police matter now.

30:48.446 --> 30:50.714
What about Lynette? We can't
let her get herself killed.

30:52.183 --> 30:53.584
I'll be going now.

30:53.618 --> 30:55.619
- Eddie. Sam.

30:55.653 --> 30:56.787
Aw, Chris.

30:56.821 --> 30:58.155
Oh, it's okay.

30:58.189 --> 30:59.990
We were pretty much done.

31:03.361 --> 31:05.305
This better be great.

31:06.631 --> 31:07.965
The combination Ricky wrote down...

31:07.999 --> 31:09.166
look what he wrote it on.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.634
It's not just a scrap of paper.

31:10.668 --> 31:13.203
It's a file request form
from the City Clerk's office.

31:13.237 --> 31:14.471
Yeah, I saw that.

31:14.505 --> 31:16.173
Okay. So what's at the Clerk's office?

31:16.207 --> 31:19.130
Public files. Police reports.
Arrest records.

31:19.164 --> 31:20.877
What if no one's been able
to find out who he is

31:20.912 --> 31:23.113
because Deacon is a cop himself?

31:23.147 --> 31:24.881
What if Ricky was combing
through these files

31:24.916 --> 31:27.017
trying to find some kind
of pattern to reveal him?

31:27.051 --> 31:28.016
Don't you think I thought of that?

31:28.051 --> 31:29.453
Well, then what are we waiting for?

31:29.487 --> 31:30.499
We know Ricky found him.

31:30.534 --> 31:32.522
- We just have to follow his trail.
- For what?

31:32.557 --> 31:34.358
We have no client. There's no case.

31:34.392 --> 31:35.525
What about Lynette?

31:35.560 --> 31:36.836
We can't just abandon her.

31:36.870 --> 31:38.629
We can't help her either
if she won't let us.

31:38.663 --> 31:39.663
Trust me, Sam.

31:39.697 --> 31:41.231
"No good deed goes unpunished"

31:41.265 --> 31:43.051
is a universal truth.

31:44.402 --> 31:45.702
Is it?

31:46.571 --> 31:48.473
Or is this about you,

31:49.207 --> 31:51.508
what happened three years ago?

31:51.542 --> 31:53.343
Marnie Stahr.

31:54.833 --> 31:57.234
Like I said, I do my research.

31:57.259 --> 31:58.224
I read the reports.

31:58.249 --> 31:59.816
They all said it wasn't your fault.

32:05.148 --> 32:07.274
Well, that doesn't matter.

32:07.308 --> 32:09.911
I was hired to protect her, and I didn't.

32:11.115 --> 32:14.217
And to punish yourself,
you started saying no.

32:14.242 --> 32:16.443
You went from the top P.I. in town

32:16.468 --> 32:17.935
to only taking small jobs.

32:22.874 --> 32:25.175
You are just like me, Eddie.

32:25.209 --> 32:27.016
You need a shot at redemption.

32:30.548 --> 32:31.848
Except in the real world,

32:31.883 --> 32:33.083
there are no fairy tale endings.

32:33.117 --> 32:34.259
Trust me.

32:34.293 --> 32:35.719
I know, and so do you,

32:35.753 --> 32:37.521
that whatever we try to do here,

32:37.555 --> 32:39.356
chances are, it is not gonna end well.

32:39.390 --> 32:42.459
We know it won't end well
if we do nothing.

32:42.493 --> 32:45.028
Is it a risk? Yeah.

32:45.063 --> 32:46.974
But I would rather risk everything

32:47.008 --> 32:48.348
for a shot at justice

32:48.382 --> 32:50.233
than risk nothing and be nothing.

32:50.268 --> 32:52.235
So what's it gonna be? Give up,

32:52.270 --> 32:53.870
or are you gonna listen
to your better angels

32:53.905 --> 32:55.238
and make a difference in the world?

32:56.041 --> 32:57.641
Wow.

32:57.675 --> 32:58.749
That's a powerful speech.

33:01.646 --> 33:02.946
Of course, I liked it better

33:02.980 --> 33:04.738
when you gave it
to your suicidal partner.

33:04.773 --> 33:06.316
Was it at end of season three?

33:06.350 --> 33:08.227
You know, when you were hunting
down that murderous clown.

33:09.454 --> 33:11.588
Fine. It's the same speech.

33:11.622 --> 33:14.392
But it doesn't mean that it's not true.

33:15.693 --> 33:18.161
Wait, hold... hold on a second!

33:18.196 --> 33:20.411
The only way that you would
know that speech

33:20.445 --> 33:22.332
is if you watched the show.

33:22.366 --> 33:23.767
You're a fan!

33:23.801 --> 33:26.903
Hold on. You are a <i>big</i> fan!

33:26.938 --> 33:28.572
No. Stop. Oh, my God, Eddie!

33:28.606 --> 33:30.240
- Come on.
- That's so cute!

33:30.274 --> 33:31.508
- Shut up.
- You're a fan!

33:31.542 --> 33:33.496
Oh, my God.
Is it exciting that you know me?

33:33.530 --> 33:35.011
Berto, I need you to do some research.

33:35.046 --> 33:36.413
Berto, he's a fan!

33:36.447 --> 33:38.014
These are copies of all the files

33:38.049 --> 33:40.684
Ricky Jenson requested.
Not just police records,

33:40.718 --> 33:42.652
but warrants and court cases.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.154
I ran a few of the subjects' names...

33:44.188 --> 33:45.789
drug dealers, prostitutes, drug runners.

33:45.823 --> 33:48.158
All have some link to Deacon's
criminal organization.

33:48.192 --> 33:49.693
And other commonalities in the files?

33:49.727 --> 33:51.528
How 'bout same detectives
working the case?

33:51.562 --> 33:53.797
All the cops were different, but
there was something the same.

33:53.831 --> 33:55.684
Look at who signed the warrants?

33:57.335 --> 33:59.369
Superior Court Judge Noah. B. Chambers.

33:59.403 --> 34:01.564
Now look at who tried the cases.

34:02.373 --> 34:03.406
Chambers.

34:03.441 --> 34:05.976
Half the trials ended
in reduced-sentence plea deals

34:06.010 --> 34:07.377
for giving up information on Deacon...

34:07.411 --> 34:08.545
Information that never paid off.

34:08.579 --> 34:10.547
Because he was controlling it.

34:10.581 --> 34:11.715
He's Deacon!

34:11.748 --> 34:12.783
He's not just above the law.

34:12.817 --> 34:14.016
He is the law.

34:14.051 --> 34:15.018
And he's always one step ahead

34:15.052 --> 34:16.085
because he's the one
who issues the warrants.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.288
His people know exactly
when the cops are coming.

34:18.322 --> 34:19.708
That's not all.

34:20.658 --> 34:22.159
I found this on his website.

34:22.693 --> 34:23.994
Check who's in this photo.

34:25.370 --> 34:26.463
Lynette's fake dad!

34:26.496 --> 34:28.465
We got him! Right?

34:28.498 --> 34:30.065
What we have is conjecture.

34:30.101 --> 34:31.199
We know it's true.

34:31.234 --> 34:32.502
But with all the people in his pocket,

34:32.536 --> 34:33.837
we'll be signing our death warrants

34:33.871 --> 34:35.539
if we decide to point fingers
without proof.

34:35.572 --> 34:37.674
Well, then, we need to do what
Ricky was going to do.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.242
Get proof.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.446
We need to get in and get
the ledgers from the safe.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.580
Breaking into his house
would be a major operation.

34:43.614 --> 34:44.714
- It'd take at least a week to plan.
- Yeah.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.750
With a bullet waiting for us
if we get it wrong... no.

34:46.784 --> 34:49.518
Or we could just walk in.

34:51.889 --> 34:54.157
Chambers is running for re-election.

34:54.192 --> 34:57.661
He's having a fundraiser at his house

34:57.695 --> 34:59.863
tomorrow night.

34:59.897 --> 35:01.064
Oh, you wanna crash?

35:01.098 --> 35:02.833
We'll never get close.

35:02.867 --> 35:03.892
You're a TV star.

35:03.926 --> 35:05.502
They'll see you coming a mile away.

35:05.536 --> 35:06.870
Will they?

35:06.904 --> 35:09.544
This is crazy. It'll never work.

35:09.578 --> 35:11.842
Trust me. It'll work.

35:11.876 --> 35:14.144
- Ready?
- Oh, as we'll ever be.

35:20.418 --> 35:21.885
How you like me now?

35:27.527 --> 35:28.818
Oh, this is a bad idea.

35:28.853 --> 35:31.433
Maybe, but it's the best
bad idea we've got.

35:31.462 --> 35:34.230
You know, I used to be scared
of getting older,

35:34.255 --> 35:36.590
but damn, I'm a serious cougar.

35:36.624 --> 35:37.958
I can do this, Eddie.

35:37.992 --> 35:39.450
Worst case, I get caught, you know.

35:39.484 --> 35:41.843
And it becomes
- one more public humiliation

35:41.877 --> 35:45.566
in a long list
of Samantha Swift scandals.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.068
If we manage to pull it off,

35:48.103 --> 35:49.798
we actually save a life.

35:51.072 --> 35:52.740
Whatever you say, I'll hear.

35:52.774 --> 35:54.942
We'll be in constant communication.

35:54.976 --> 35:58.212
Now... do you remember your name?

35:58.246 --> 36:00.614
The name's Dixie Burnside.

36:00.648 --> 36:02.916
<i>Really? A Southern accent?</i>

36:02.951 --> 36:04.818
I'm just getting into character.

36:04.853 --> 36:07.154
Once you're inside,
you mingle, you fit in.

36:07.188 --> 36:08.889
Be inconspicuous.

36:09.290 --> 36:10.591
Oh!

36:10.625 --> 36:12.493
I am so...

36:12.527 --> 36:13.727
sorry!

36:13.762 --> 36:14.879
Paul Seaborn.

36:14.914 --> 36:16.263
Have we, uh... have we met?

36:16.297 --> 36:17.664
I don't believe we have.

36:17.699 --> 36:18.758
Dixie Burnside.

36:18.793 --> 36:20.334
Look, I'm sure you get this all the time,

36:20.368 --> 36:22.903
but, you have the most incredible eyes.

36:22.937 --> 36:26.306
Well, aren't you a charmer, Mr. Seaborn.

36:26.341 --> 36:27.941
Please. Paul.

36:29.377 --> 36:30.752
Would you excuse me?

36:30.787 --> 36:32.780
- Duty calls.
- Oh, of course.

36:35.016 --> 36:36.316
<i>Sounds like you made a friend.</i>

36:36.351 --> 36:37.818
Close call with fake Dad.

36:37.852 --> 36:39.530
He was happy to see me,

36:39.564 --> 36:41.835
but that was definitely
a gun in his pocket.

36:41.868 --> 36:43.824
In the back of the basement
is a door to the outside.

36:43.858 --> 36:46.093
Problem is, it's steel reinforced,

36:46.127 --> 36:48.162
sliding dead bolts.
Making it un-pickable.

36:48.196 --> 36:50.330
So what you need to do is
just open up that door for me

36:50.365 --> 36:51.765
and just return to the party.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.934
At some point,
Chambers will make a speech.

36:53.968 --> 36:55.702
Thank you.

36:55.737 --> 36:57.337
I want to thank you all for coming.

36:57.372 --> 36:58.472
When all eyes are on him,

36:58.506 --> 37:00.541
that'll be your best shot
at slipping out unnoticed.

37:00.575 --> 37:02.209
According to the floor plans,

37:02.243 --> 37:03.677
there's an entrance through the kitchen

37:03.711 --> 37:05.114
and down this stairway.

37:05.149 --> 37:07.381
I'm sorry, ma'am. You can't be down here.

37:07.415 --> 37:09.183
If that's security, get out now.

37:09.217 --> 37:12.052
Oh, I just need to grab a bottle of vino

37:12.086 --> 37:13.854
and then I'll be out of your hair.

37:13.888 --> 37:15.389
I can't let anyone back here.

37:15.423 --> 37:17.558
<i>Sam, go back. It's too risky.</i>

37:17.592 --> 37:19.359
You see, it's for the judge.

37:19.394 --> 37:21.228
And Paul told me to tell you it was okay.

37:21.262 --> 37:22.506
Mr. Seaborn?

37:22.541 --> 37:24.198
If you don't believe me,
we can go see him.

37:24.232 --> 37:26.200
But I hate to keep the judge waiting.

37:26.234 --> 37:27.534
You know how he gets.

37:27.569 --> 37:29.069
All right. Come on.

37:31.773 --> 37:32.873
Sam, talk to me.

37:32.907 --> 37:34.408
I need to get rid of this guard.

37:34.443 --> 37:35.976
What the hell are you doing?

37:36.010 --> 37:37.211
<i>You need to get out, now!</i>

37:37.245 --> 37:40.147
Okay, you got it? Come on. Let's go.

37:45.620 --> 37:47.054
I'm sorry.

37:50.625 --> 37:52.159
All right, we gotta move.

37:52.193 --> 37:54.394
- Keep an eye out. The safe?
- Uh, middle cabinet.

38:04.472 --> 38:06.935
Ricky was right, this is everything.

38:07.308 --> 38:09.142
Eddie!

38:09.811 --> 38:11.278
Lynette, are you okay?

38:13.047 --> 38:15.449
Damn it. That's why they had
a guard down here.

38:17.118 --> 38:18.619
Hands.

38:18.653 --> 38:19.953
Step where I can see you.

38:24.292 --> 38:26.627
I knew we'd met before. Gun, please.

38:28.496 --> 38:29.696
On the ground.

38:34.435 --> 38:35.819
Well, it's been quite a day.

38:35.854 --> 38:38.238
First, Ms. Rainey there
shows up with the catering crew,

38:38.273 --> 38:39.373
and then you two.

38:39.407 --> 38:41.875
Makes it easy for me, though,
all of you in one place.

38:41.910 --> 38:43.210
You're not gonna shoot us.

38:43.244 --> 38:44.645
Your boss won't like the press.

38:44.679 --> 38:46.213
What, because some has-been actress

38:46.247 --> 38:47.714
just out of rehab killed herself

38:47.749 --> 38:49.616
after accidentally shooting the P.I.

38:49.651 --> 38:50.951
she was shadowing?

38:50.985 --> 38:52.419
People will love that.

38:52.453 --> 38:53.620
Now, the ledgers.

38:53.655 --> 38:55.222
You won't get away with this.

38:55.256 --> 38:57.557
Oh, yes we will. You know why?

38:57.592 --> 38:59.993
Because we always get away with it.

39:00.028 --> 39:01.328
Not today.

39:01.362 --> 39:02.904
Do you know why?

39:02.938 --> 39:04.659
Because I'm greedy...

39:05.433 --> 39:07.100
for justice.

39:07.135 --> 39:08.402
Greedy for justice?

39:08.436 --> 39:09.903
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

39:11.105 --> 39:12.606
It means...

39:12.640 --> 39:14.308
that you should watch more TV.

39:21.883 --> 39:24.084
Whoa! Did you see that?!

39:24.118 --> 39:25.319
That was awesome!

39:25.353 --> 39:26.653
I was awesome. I mean, you too.

39:26.688 --> 39:28.755
But you know, you do this all the time.
But me, who knew?!

39:36.564 --> 39:38.024
Eddie Valetik, right?

39:38.059 --> 39:40.534
You just made my Christmas list.

39:42.170 --> 39:44.771
Think he'll knit me a sweater?

39:44.806 --> 39:48.328
I think your life just got
a lot more complicated.

39:49.377 --> 39:50.957
At least there's enough in those ledgers

39:50.991 --> 39:53.447
to put him away
for a couple of lifetimes.

39:53.481 --> 39:54.448
But I gotta say,

39:54.482 --> 39:58.552
that was the stupidest thing
you've ever done.

39:58.586 --> 40:00.757
How did she talk you into it?

40:01.823 --> 40:03.657
I'm still trying to figure that out.

40:03.691 --> 40:05.959
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

40:05.994 --> 40:08.362
If it weren't for you guys, I'd be dead.

40:08.396 --> 40:09.830
Thank you, Sam.

40:09.864 --> 40:12.466
Oh, come on. Ricky was the real hero.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.468
Standing up and putting
his life on the line

40:14.502 --> 40:15.859
so he could be with you.

40:15.893 --> 40:18.839
But getting him justice...

40:18.873 --> 40:20.374
you're a hero, too.

40:26.047 --> 40:27.547
Bye.

40:30.284 --> 40:32.352
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Wait a second.

40:32.387 --> 40:33.887
No, no, no. This...

40:33.921 --> 40:35.489
Are those real tears?

40:35.523 --> 40:37.691
I... just got a little makeup in my eye.

40:37.725 --> 40:40.560
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

40:42.263 --> 40:43.497
Well, I guess this is it.

40:43.531 --> 40:45.599
I guess so.

40:48.262 --> 40:50.404
You know, for what it's worth...

40:54.475 --> 40:55.442
...you didn't suck.

40:56.811 --> 40:58.612
Come on, Eddie. Let's not get all sappy.

40:58.646 --> 41:00.080
Mm.

41:00.114 --> 41:01.548
Thanks for giving me a shot.

41:03.117 --> 41:04.584
Good luck, Sam.

41:17.665 --> 41:19.099
Hey, wait! You're my ride!

41:38.019 --> 41:39.619
_

41:49.530 --> 41:51.965
They were all waiting
when I got here this morning.

41:51.999 --> 41:53.500
It's gotta be all the publicity.

41:53.534 --> 41:55.102
- Hmm.

41:55.136 --> 41:56.303
- Okay.

41:58.106 --> 42:00.173
Gimme me a minute,
and then send the first one in.

42:00.208 --> 42:02.275
Eddie, there's something you should know.

42:02.310 --> 42:04.177
They don't want just you.

42:18.659 --> 42:19.626
Hello?

42:19.660 --> 42:20.994
Sam. It's Eddie.
