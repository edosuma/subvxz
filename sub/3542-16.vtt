00:04.080 --> 00:07.482
The only thing stronger than your craving
for blood is your love for this girl.

00:07.680 --> 00:09.330
How long since you had human blood?

00:09.520 --> 00:12.490
Since the night I threatened
to drive Elena off the bridge.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.160
Look at the images
on the wall behind Elena.

00:15.360 --> 00:19.081
The white oak tree, 300 years after
we fled back to the old world.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.329
- That tree could kill us.
- Brian Walters, the medical examiner.

00:22.520 --> 00:23.965
- Not a vampire.
- This was murder.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.571
Why don't you just ask Ric...

00:25.760 --> 00:28.286
if his dirty little doctor
had access to the weapons?

00:28.480 --> 00:30.209
You think I killed my ex-boyfriend?

00:30.880 --> 00:32.006
Dad?

00:36.240 --> 00:38.368
You weren't supposed to see that.

00:51.560 --> 00:55.087
Will you get home all right?
I can send for a police vehicle.

00:55.320 --> 00:58.642
A little winter chill never hurt anyone,
Sheriff Forbes.

00:58.840 --> 01:01.571
I am less concerned
about the cold, more for your safety.

01:01.760 --> 01:06.368
One councilman's murder
doesn't make an epidemic, Gerald.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.722
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.127
The mystery
is not gonna get solved any faster...

01:49.320 --> 01:50.651
with you yelling at me, Carol.

01:50.880 --> 01:54.043
We have two council murders
and an attempted murder on our hands.

01:54.240 --> 01:57.210
If you have a suspect,
it is your duty to keep me in the loop.

01:57.400 --> 02:01.121
It's my duty to make sure I don't accuse
an innocent person of being a killer.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.448
Just tell me who it is, Liz.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.487
I didn't do it.

02:30.680 --> 02:33.047
You're arresting him for
what this nutjob Dr. Fell says?

02:33.240 --> 02:35.720
No, I'm detaining him.
The cell is for his own good.

02:35.960 --> 02:38.770
You were shot.
Dr. Fell used vampire blood to heal you.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.725
- Dr. Fell shot me.
- Because you came at her with a knife.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.127
With a knife I had found
hidden in her things.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.448
We gonna ignore
that he's one of the victims?

02:46.680 --> 02:48.364
He was practically stabbed to death.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.490
Dr. Fell suggested his wounds
could have been self-inï¬‚icted.

02:51.680 --> 02:55.321
- God, you think I stabbed myself?
- Look, I think I don't know what to think.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.205
I've got nothing except murder weapons
from your stash...

02:58.440 --> 03:01.284
and a member of a founding family
pointing a long finger.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.484
- She is setting me up. I'm being framed.
- That may be so.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.808
- But I don't have any proof.
- We'll find some.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.690
No, just stay out of this, Damon.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.008
You getting involved
will make matters worse.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.440
- Listen...
- Don't make me...

03:12.640 --> 03:14.529
put you in that cell with him.

03:19.040 --> 03:22.487
- What are we running, a marathon?
- If you can't keep up...

03:22.720 --> 03:27.328
Elena, you can't outrun your problems,
although it looks like you're gonna try.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.449
I talked to Bonnie.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.326
- What did she say?
- They're at her mom's house.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.520
Abby's gonna complete the transition.

03:38.920 --> 03:42.083
- She decided to become a vampire?
- Yeah.

03:42.320 --> 03:46.928
Caroline's gonna help her through it,
teach her control and stuff.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.687
Did Bonnie say...?

03:52.040 --> 03:54.042
Is there anything I can do?

03:54.240 --> 03:58.529
She knows it's not your fault, Elena.
She's just upset.

03:58.720 --> 04:02.167
Damon turned her mom into a vampire
to save my life.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.886
It's absolutely my fault.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.170
You're gonna make me run more,
aren't you?

04:11.240 --> 04:14.244
- Who is it?
- Sheriff Forbes, is everything okay?

04:17.079 --> 04:18.889
He what?

04:31.200 --> 04:33.407
- Were you just with...?
- Ric's fine.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.602
Sheriff wants me to stay out of it.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.285
But you're not going to, are you?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.570
Seems just as good a plan as any.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.007
Your friend's in jail for murder.
Do something.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.170
Well, I guess I could rip out
Dr. False Accusation's throat...

04:47.360 --> 04:48.486
or maybe her tongue.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.564
I could chew it up in little tiny pieces
and feed it to the squirrels.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.807
Stop it, Damon.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.607
Guess me staying out of it suddenly
sounds like a good idea, doesn't it?

04:58.240 --> 05:00.402
I saved your life last night.
You're welcome.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.524
You know, you could show
a little compassion about Bonnie.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.121
Ah, I know. You're right.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.171
Her and her mom
must be really hurting right now.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.563
Should I send lasagna?

05:12.160 --> 05:14.891
- Okay, now you're just being mean.
- I'm mean, you hate me.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.122
The Earth is back on its axis.

05:17.320 --> 05:21.325
You know, if you keep pushing
people away, you're gonna end up alone.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.768
Dear diary...

05:46.960 --> 05:49.486
a chipmunk asked me
my name today.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.170
I told him it was Joe.

05:51.360 --> 05:54.762
- That lie will haunt me forever.
- What do you want?

05:54.960 --> 05:57.566
I was hoping we could hang.
A little brother-bonding.

05:57.760 --> 06:00.969
I mean,
I know we don't actually "hang out."

06:01.160 --> 06:06.326
We team up, we join forces,
activate our Wonder Twin powers...

06:08.560 --> 06:11.131
- What are you doing?
- Digging up clues.

06:11.320 --> 06:14.642
Most of the Originals are gone,
but now we have a whodunit in town.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.171
Remember when we came back...

06:16.360 --> 06:18.169
- ...for Zachariah's funeral?
- Vaguely.

06:18.360 --> 06:22.126
If memory serves, he wasn't the first
Founder's Council member...

06:22.360 --> 06:25.807
- ...killed that year, or even that month.
- Your point being?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.367
- I'm trying to remember what year it was.
- 1912.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.891
So much for "vaguely."

06:32.240 --> 06:36.404
1912. Or as I like to call it...

06:36.600 --> 06:39.729
the last time Mystic Falls
had a serial killer on its hands.

06:48.480 --> 06:52.246
<i>It feels strange to
be home again after so long away.</i>

06:57.600 --> 06:59.762
<i>I thought I would never return.</i>

07:00.440 --> 07:02.841
<i>Certainly not for a funeral.</i>

07:03.880 --> 07:06.360
<i>I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Salvatore.</i>

07:06.560 --> 07:08.801
I'm told you're a distant cousin
of Zachariah?

07:09.000 --> 07:12.243
- His nephew, actually, Miss...?
- Lockwood.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.204
Marianna Lockwood.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.528
And this is my friend,
Samantha Gilbert.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.530
- As in Johnathan Gilbert?
- My late grandfather.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.564
- Did you know him?
- Crossed paths.

07:24.360 --> 07:28.251
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be,
ahem, inappropriate...

07:29.040 --> 07:32.931
but no one seems to be willing to
discuss the details of Zachariah's death.

07:34.640 --> 07:37.007
He was murdered.
And he wasn't the first.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.567
- Samantha, don't be a gossip.
- Why not? He should know.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.410
He's a founding family like us.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.564
Be careful, Mr. Salvatore.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.001
It's not a good time to be a Founder
in this town.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.800
Have you been eating
the relatives again?

08:04.560 --> 08:06.130
Damon.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.129
It's been a long time, brother.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.005
It's been almost 50 years.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.084
I'm surprised you came.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.123
And miss the funeral of...?

08:15.320 --> 08:18.210
What do you call him,
Uncle Zachariah?

08:22.080 --> 08:25.527
- I see you're still mad at me.
- Why would I be mad at you, Stefan?

08:25.720 --> 08:26.767
You made me a vampire.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.645
Now I walk the world alone
drinking other people's blood.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.446
Any chance you took it all out
on our nephew Zachariah?

08:32.640 --> 08:35.803
If I'm not mistaken, you're the one
who killed our family members.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.289
- May our father rest in peace.
- I'm not like that anymore.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.642
Congratulations, Stefan.

08:41.840 --> 08:42.921
If you'll excuse me...

08:43.159 --> 08:47.370
I'd like to live out my eternal existence
as far away from you as possible.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.209
Damon, wait.

08:53.840 --> 08:57.447
Let's grab a drink. Catch up.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.567
I've missed you, brother.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.563
Sure. Why not?

09:16.880 --> 09:19.281
<i>What do you say, brother?
You wanna go get drunk?</i>

09:19.760 --> 09:20.807
Ah.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.850
I get it, I get it.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.048
You're bored.
Your best friend's in jail.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.811
And you don't have anything better
to do with yourself.

09:29.040 --> 09:34.570
Well, there is that. And I was hoping
you could help me solve a murder.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.682
Thank you for meeting with me, mayor.

09:46.880 --> 09:49.121
I figured as head of
the Preservation Society...

09:49.320 --> 09:51.971
you'd be a good person
to ask about the oldest trees.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.288
Lockwood women
used to keep those records.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.050
Back before any of them
had actual jobs.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.964
I've been to the Founders' archive.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.283
But I can't seem to find any record
of the tree I'm looking for.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.164
It probably got cut down.

10:05.360 --> 10:08.364
Big old trees built half this town
in the 1900s.

10:08.560 --> 10:12.007
Ooh, she-devil, 9:00.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.485
Do you know who kept
the milling ledgers during that period?

10:23.720 --> 10:26.929
Back then, all the logging mills
were owned by the Salvatores.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.047
So, what does a medical examiner,
Bill Forbes...

10:34.240 --> 10:36.607
and Alaric Saltzman
have in common?

10:38.520 --> 10:40.249
Come on, knock it off.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.207
Hmm.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.370
You know, quitting blood cold-turkey
after a ripper binge...

10:45.560 --> 10:47.289
probably not the best approach.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.090
Every time you play that game,
you leave a trail of bodies.

10:51.280 --> 10:55.205
So I'm thinking now is a good time
to pay our old friend moderation a visit.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.767
They were all
on the Founder's Council, Damon.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.964
- That's what they have in common.
- But why them, huh?

11:01.160 --> 11:04.050
Brian Walters and Alaric
weren't from founding families.

11:04.240 --> 11:08.245
I mean, hey, if you gotta slaughter
council members, go A-list.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.727
At least in 1912,
they killed a Salvatore.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.287
Which Salvatore would that be?

11:15.920 --> 11:18.730
You'll have to agree, sheriff,
there's no motive here.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.890
Look, both the medical examiner
and my ex-husband...

11:22.080 --> 11:25.402
got into altercations with Meredith Fell
before their deaths.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.444
She said you were a witness
to her fight with Brian Walters.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.642
So are you saying
I was defending her honor?

11:30.840 --> 11:33.241
- I barely knew her.
- She said she also told you...

11:33.440 --> 11:36.410
Bill threatened to report her
for giving him vampire blood.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.968
<i>- No, she didn't.
- A 2 a.m. call on the night he was killed?</i>

11:41.000 --> 11:45.164
I pulled your records.
You spoke with her for over an hour.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.891
Okay, I, uh...

11:52.240 --> 11:56.484
Yes, I... I remember calling her, but I...

11:56.960 --> 12:01.090
I was drinking
and I don't remember the conversation.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.606
Do you have an alibi for the night
Walters was killed?

12:04.800 --> 12:08.327
I was there the night of the bridge
fundraiser until midnight. You saw me.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.205
Time of death was between
1 and 3 a.m.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.050
Well, then, uh...

12:14.680 --> 12:18.651
I must have been home, sleeping,
I'm sure of it.

12:18.880 --> 12:19.927
I'm sure of it.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.329
So, Zachariah Salvatore
was your nephew?

12:25.520 --> 12:29.161
Our father knocked up one of the maids
during the Civil War. She had a son.

12:29.360 --> 12:32.170
But as far as everyone else knew,
Stefan and I were dead.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.044
The family name had to go somewhere.

12:34.240 --> 12:37.005
And, uh, your family owned
the logging mills back then?

12:37.200 --> 12:38.850
You're full of a lot of questions.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.964
Just researching the town history.
I grew up here, after all.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.846
You know, you don't have to disguise
your true motives, bonny Beks.

12:46.040 --> 12:49.203
If you want more sex, just ask for it.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.528
- Not enough liquor in the world.
- Oh, come on.

12:51.720 --> 12:54.087
It was too good
for you to be this hostile.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.961
You'll have to excuse my little brother.

12:59.160 --> 13:01.128
He's jonesing for some O-positive.

13:02.560 --> 13:06.087
- I'm not jonesing.
- So did they ever catch the killer?

13:06.680 --> 13:09.411
No. Wrote it all off on the vampires.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.361
- Maybe it was a vampire.
- Yeah.

13:12.600 --> 13:16.207
Yeah, maybe it was a vampire, Damon.

13:16.440 --> 13:19.762
Don't think for a second
you didn't cross my mind too, brother.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.611
But these murders weren't your style,
were they?

13:23.440 --> 13:26.683
Plus there were no other vampires
circulating then.

13:26.880 --> 13:29.247
Well, there was one other vampire.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.370
Remember Sage?

13:32.560 --> 13:34.767
Oh, right.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.764
Sage.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.600
Speaking of great sex, whew...

13:42.520 --> 13:44.887
- Maybe you've had enough.
- Ladies, gentlemen.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.127
Hit a man when he's down.

13:46.320 --> 13:47.890
Sell your horse, come one and all...

13:48.080 --> 13:49.127
Ah.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.210
To see the San Francisco
World's Fair middleweight champ...

13:54.440 --> 13:55.851
Gentlemen, for an evening...

14:09.000 --> 14:10.445
Who's next?

14:10.640 --> 14:14.531
One hundred dollars to any man
who can beat me.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.085
I can teach you to survive
without human blood, you know.

14:25.280 --> 14:28.124
You do not get to lecture me
on how to live my life.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.367
Not anymore.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.124
- What's your name?
- Not interested.

14:42.320 --> 14:46.120
Well, Mr. Not-Interested,
you seem to me like a gambling man.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.169
Afraid you have me all wrong.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.885
Well, that's too bad.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.443
I knew a Sage once.
Trashy little thing.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.484
You think it was Sage
killing all those Founders back then?

15:07.680 --> 15:10.081
Town questioned every grown man
in Mystic Falls.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.721
It probably never occurred to them
that a woman could have done it.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.326
I'm due in surgery.

15:23.560 --> 15:26.530
Whatever case you're gonna make
against Alaric, make it quick.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.529
I don't have to. He didn't do anything.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.405
How do you know?
You live with him, he takes care of you.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.409
But do you really know
anything about him?

15:33.600 --> 15:37.241
- Heh, I know enough.
- Let me tell you what I know.

15:37.440 --> 15:40.523
He was arrested for fighting four times
before the age of 21.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.166
When he was at Duke,
his future wife Isobel...

15:43.360 --> 15:46.250
filed a restraining order
against him twice.

15:46.840 --> 15:50.003
Although then she married him,
so I guess that says more about her.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.931
- Okay, you're making all of this up.
- Am I?

15:53.120 --> 15:54.167
How would you know?

15:54.360 --> 15:57.045
You took pity on a borderline-alcoholic
vampire hunter...

15:57.240 --> 15:59.607
and you never even thought
to look any deeper.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.727
How could you do this to him?

16:02.920 --> 16:05.446
He didn't kill anyone and you know it.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.686
You date vampires, Elena.

16:09.880 --> 16:14.090
It shouldn't come as a shock to learn
that your guardian is a murderer.

16:24.360 --> 16:27.489
So, uh, tell me more
about your old relatives.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.331
I heard they tore down
half the woods to build this town.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.648
Easy there, lushy-pants.

16:32.880 --> 16:36.726
It's been a hoot and a half, but
it's boys' night and you weren't invited.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.087
Wow, nice job.

16:45.280 --> 16:48.124
I'll add breaking and entering
to the list of life favors you owe me.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.080
I don't know how much longer
she's gonna be in surgery...

16:52.320 --> 16:54.368
so let's see what we can find.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.962
Don't you think the police already
combed through this place?

16:58.200 --> 17:00.202
- She handed over everything she had.
- Yeah.

17:00.400 --> 17:03.449
I'm looking for the evidence
that she didn't hand over.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.040
You're sure it's her
we should be investigating?

17:06.240 --> 17:09.881
I know him, Matt. He's innocent.

17:10.079 --> 17:12.685
And I know that Meredith is a Fell.

17:12.920 --> 17:16.527
A founding family, which means...

17:35.400 --> 17:38.927
Skeletons in the closet.
Just like a true Founder.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.362
"Brian Walters, Bill Forbes."

18:03.280 --> 18:04.770
"Alaric Saltzman."

18:05.640 --> 18:09.087
So let's just say Sage
was killing everyone in 1912.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.884
Who the hell is doing it now?

18:11.800 --> 18:14.883
It's not that psycho, Dr. Fell.
She's a woman.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.765
There's no way she could stab
three grown men.

18:19.120 --> 18:22.602
That's a bit sexist.
A woman could easily kill a man.

18:22.800 --> 18:27.567
- With the right motivation.
- You just, uh, don't give up, do you?

18:27.760 --> 18:30.604
Why are you so grumpy?
- He's on a master cleanse.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.484
Trying to be a better man and all.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.288
You know, you were a lot more fun
in the '20s.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.802
Don't rile him up. He's testy
when he's being self-righteous.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.764
I'm not being self-righteous, Damon.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.645
I'm not interested in slaughtering
innocent human beings.

18:44.840 --> 18:47.969
Oh, okay. Fair enough.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.924
My mistake.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.367
You used to be self-righteous.

18:53.560 --> 18:57.201
â€œDear diary, Damon has lost his way.

18:57.440 --> 19:02.401
Though I have pulled my own life
together, he continues to waste his."

19:02.600 --> 19:04.682
Ouch.

19:05.240 --> 19:09.689
"His bitterness consumes him.
He is nothing but blackness and bile."

19:09.880 --> 19:12.884
- Ooh, judgey.
- Oh, this is fun.

19:13.080 --> 19:16.050
If I'm being honest,
you didn't seem like much fun either.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.164
I wasn't. The woman I was in love with
was stuck in a tomb...

19:19.360 --> 19:21.761
and she wasn't getting out
for a hundred years.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.726
<i>I wasn't having any fun at all.</i>

19:29.200 --> 19:30.565
How sad.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.364
You're doing it all wrong.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.731
Bad vampire.

19:36.880 --> 19:39.770
I was hungry. Now I am not hungry.

19:39.960 --> 19:43.043
My quality of form
is purely subjective.

19:43.280 --> 19:46.523
A woman isn't just for food.
She's for pleasure.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.769
I do not need a woman for pleasure.
I am spoken for.

19:51.240 --> 19:54.210
We are all spoken for in some way.

19:54.760 --> 19:58.401
But what is being a vampire
if not relishing in the pleasure of it?

20:03.760 --> 20:05.808
Come along. Let me show you.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.763
Hit him! Hit him!

20:23.640 --> 20:26.371
Look at the women.
They're beautiful, aren't they?

20:26.560 --> 20:30.531
Not them.
They're too hungry for attention.

20:30.720 --> 20:34.725
You want the ones who button
themselves up. Watch them.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.088
They can't tear their eyes away.

20:37.280 --> 20:40.648
Those are the women
who secretly crave seduction.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.763
They'll put up a good fight,
but the game is in winning them over.

20:44.960 --> 20:48.123
- Making them beg for it.
- What if they don't?

20:48.320 --> 20:51.802
You're a vampire. You take it.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.485
Her.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.449
That sounds like Sage, all right.

21:20.640 --> 21:21.971
How did you know her?

21:22.160 --> 21:25.369
She was obsessed with my brother Finn
over 900 years ago.

21:25.560 --> 21:28.484
What? Creepy suicidal guy?

21:28.720 --> 21:31.246
- You're doing it again.
- All right, ahem.

21:31.440 --> 21:33.647
You know what? I need to, uh...

21:33.840 --> 21:36.366
- I gotta get out of here.
- Sure.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.523
First, admit you're jonesing.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.882
- Damon, I'm not...
- Admit it.

21:41.080 --> 21:44.129
Fine, I'm freaking out.
I'm ready to eat the entire wait staff.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.569
- Why do you need to hear me say it?
- Because I'm feeling self-righteous too.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.608
She's got everything on him.
Medical records, old court documents.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.370
What's this?

22:04.360 --> 22:06.249
It's an old Gilbert journal.

22:06.840 --> 22:10.049
Why is one of your old family journals
in her closet?

22:12.160 --> 22:14.686
Didn't you say the medical examiner's
time of death...

22:14.880 --> 22:17.008
- ...was between 1 and 3 a.m.?
- Yeah, why?

22:17.200 --> 22:20.727
Because the county coroner's office
says that's wrong.

22:24.560 --> 22:25.846
Oh, my God.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.446
I think...

23:14.160 --> 23:16.401
What were you thinking?
- I know we had no right.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.523
No right? You broke the law.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.848
But we found something
that clears Alaric.

23:21.080 --> 23:23.287
It gives him an alibi
in Brian Walters' murder.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.528
- You mean this?
- What is that?

23:25.720 --> 23:28.530
A letter from the coroner's office
correcting the error...

23:28.760 --> 23:32.287
in the time of death of Brian Walters.
Meredith Fell received it today.

23:32.480 --> 23:36.451
She brought it to me hours ago, full of
apologies for accusing an innocent man.

23:36.680 --> 23:40.241
- Why'd she hide a copy in her closet?
- I can't ask those questions, Matt...

23:40.480 --> 23:42.642
because you broke into her home
to find it.

23:42.840 --> 23:46.083
Do you know how much
I'm already protecting both of you?

23:46.680 --> 23:48.887
- I'm sorry.
- Just...

23:49.640 --> 23:52.644
get out of my office and go home,
please.

23:54.760 --> 23:57.843
Alaric will be released
as soon as the letter is authenticated.

24:00.080 --> 24:01.161
Go.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.168
So he doesn't want to drink
human blood?

24:08.360 --> 24:10.442
Ah, he has an eternally
guilty conscience.

24:10.640 --> 24:14.281
Funny, when I knew him in the
'20s, he didn't have any conscience at all.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.847
It's one of the things
I liked most about him.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.086
He can't possibly think...

24:19.280 --> 24:21.760
- ...he can survive without feeding.
- On the contrary.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.725
He's determined to live
pursuing one extreme or the other.

24:24.920 --> 24:26.888
He's a stubborn one, my brother.

24:28.720 --> 24:31.485
Ah, I think I'm gonna need some help
with this one.

24:31.800 --> 24:32.847
What can I do?

24:43.960 --> 24:45.928
- Hello.
- Hi.

24:46.120 --> 24:49.044
This may seem very forward
but you're just so pretty.

24:49.240 --> 24:51.527
- Thank you.
- And please don't scream.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.842
You're about to have a very,
very bad night.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.122
- Stop! Stop.
- Unh.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.970
Sorry, brother.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.089
It's dinnertime. Have a bite.

25:12.160 --> 25:14.322
- What are you doing?
- Tough love, Stefan.

25:14.520 --> 25:16.841
You're not gonna survive
this cold-turkey thing.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.361
It's time to get that monkey
off your back.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.524
- No.
- Feed.

25:23.920 --> 25:27.208
Or I'll let Rebekah have her way with her.
You know she'll kill her.

25:27.400 --> 25:30.643
- Oh, I will.
- Then her blood will be on your hands.

25:30.880 --> 25:35.010
Or you can just have a little drink
and save her life. Come on, Stefan.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.204
You were the one who said you didn't
want more innocent lives slaughtered.

25:39.120 --> 25:43.284
Save her. Go on, have a bite.
I snatched, you eat, I'll erase.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.329
Hell, I'll even heal her for you
when it's over.

25:45.560 --> 25:48.006
Ugh! Why do this?
You know what blood does to me.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.771
Because you let it control you.
You always have.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.167
I'm just here to help you
learn to fight it.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.970
This is rubbish.

26:11.480 --> 26:13.130
That's it, Stefan.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.042
I got it from here. Go ahead.

26:25.240 --> 26:28.562
- The night's just getting started.
- Scram. No one likes a lurker.

26:28.760 --> 26:31.650
- You're a real ass, you know?
- So I'm told.

26:34.640 --> 26:37.644
All right, that's enough.
Come on, you're gonna bleed her dry.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.330
You're gonna drain her down.
Come on.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.241
I said that's enough.

26:44.440 --> 26:47.922
Hey, you wanna fight hunger
or you wanna fight me?

26:50.000 --> 26:52.048
<i>L 90! you.</i>

26:52.240 --> 26:53.924
That's a good girl.

26:54.120 --> 26:56.043
What are you doing?

27:00.480 --> 27:02.448
Stefan?

27:08.840 --> 27:10.888
Elena.

27:12.240 --> 27:14.527
- What are you two doing?
- Relax, Elena.

27:15.160 --> 27:16.650
Just a little experiment.

27:16.840 --> 27:19.605
No need to make this
more dramatic than it needs to be.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.087
Elena, let's just go.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.490
Elena.

27:39.280 --> 27:41.328
$0...

27:41.520 --> 27:44.091
That's gonna take a little time.

27:48.760 --> 27:52.560
Stefan, wait. Hey, Stefan, wait.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.450
Just say it.

28:11.120 --> 28:13.441
I just don't get it,
your thing with them.

28:13.640 --> 28:15.165
I know it doesn't make sense.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.648
But at the beginning...

28:20.800 --> 28:22.962
after my parents died...

28:23.320 --> 28:28.884
there was something about being
with Stefan that just felt safe.

28:29.080 --> 28:32.402
Safe? Elena, he's a vampire.

28:32.640 --> 28:37.806
I know, believe me. Just saying it
out loud, it sounds crazy, but...

28:38.840 --> 28:43.084
it's like I knew
that he would never stop loving me.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.165
Like he would never...

28:46.240 --> 28:47.810
What?

28:50.680 --> 28:52.409
Die.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.484
Like he would never die.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.847
Like your parents did.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.209
And Damon?

29:13.040 --> 29:17.329
Damon just sort of snuck up on me.

29:18.680 --> 29:21.650
He got under my skin,
and no matter what I do, I just...

29:22.880 --> 29:25.042
I can't shake him.

29:26.880 --> 29:30.646
Once you fall in love with someone,
I don't know if...

29:30.840 --> 29:33.764
I don't know if
you can ever shake them.

29:45.520 --> 29:49.525
I'm sorry, is...? Is this weird?

29:50.040 --> 29:52.805
Talking about them with you?

29:54.360 --> 29:55.725
No.

29:56.760 --> 29:58.285
Not really.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.610
I got you something.

30:05.560 --> 30:08.882
- The journal?
- It's your family's. You should have it.

30:09.080 --> 30:12.084
Meredith and that idiot deputy
were too busy questioning you...

30:12.280 --> 30:13.725
to give a damn about me.

30:14.760 --> 30:19.129
Sometimes it pays to be the only
normal one in a town of vampires.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.289
You're practically invisible.

30:33.440 --> 30:37.604
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.169
They let Ric go.

31:14.840 --> 31:19.289
Sheriff Forbes said she's out of suspects
again, but Ric is in the clear.

31:25.560 --> 31:30.487
I know it may not seem like it,
but you did really well tonight.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.488
I mean, before you know it,
you're gonna be the king of moderation.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.971
- Elena will understand.
- Doesn't really matter what Elena thinks.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.766
Uh-uh. None of that.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.048
No more No-Humanity Stefan.

31:47.560 --> 31:51.087
There's a road called Recovery,
and we are on it.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.121
Why do you even care, huh?

31:55.320 --> 31:58.881
The whole brother-bonding thing,
getting Elena to hate you.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.321
Feel guilty because you kissed her?
Is that it?

32:01.560 --> 32:04.848
Because you can stop. Go back
to hating me. It was a lot easier.

32:05.040 --> 32:08.362
Can you for one minute actually believe
that I'm trying to help you?

32:08.560 --> 32:10.369
I don't need your help.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.369
You don't need my...?

32:13.320 --> 32:17.006
Are you kidding me? Do you remember
what happened last time you said that?

32:17.240 --> 32:20.801
- What are you talking about?
- 1912, Stefan.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.566
<i>The last time I convinced you
to drink human blood.</i>

32:24.960 --> 32:27.327
Go ahead, Stefan. Pick one.

32:27.520 --> 32:31.491
- They're people, Damon.
- Yes, they are people, Stefan.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.001
People with blood
pumping through their veins...

32:34.200 --> 32:37.682
waiting to be opened up
and sucked dry.

32:37.880 --> 32:40.087
You've just forgotten
how good it feels.

32:41.600 --> 32:45.969
<i>So had I, but Sage, she reminded me.</i>

32:47.200 --> 32:50.727
<i>It's worth it. It's all worth it.</i>

32:55.120 --> 32:58.488
Not him, Stefan. Not him.

33:00.440 --> 33:04.161
Her. She's the one.

33:07.160 --> 33:11.370
- I don't do that anymore.
- But you can, Stefan. We can.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.162
Let the past be the past.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.922
Have a drink with me, brother.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.480
I knew you still had it in you.

33:41.400 --> 33:42.447
Don't be greedy.

33:46.760 --> 33:48.603
Stefan. Stefan!

34:03.320 --> 34:05.129
Oh, my God.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.449
Oh, my God.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.483
I'm sorry.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.523
Stefan, stop. Stefan, stop.

34:11.719 --> 34:13.848
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Stefan, stop.

34:14.040 --> 34:15.804
- What did you do to me?
- Shh!

34:16.000 --> 34:19.368
- Stefan...
- What did you do to me?

34:23.159 --> 34:26.766
You just need to learn when to stop.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.321
- I can help you.
- I don't need your help.

34:32.840 --> 34:35.810
<i>The Founder's Council killer
had nothing on you.</i>

34:36.000 --> 34:39.482
<i>By decade's end, they were calling you
the Ripper of Monterey.</i>

34:40.199 --> 34:42.248
I let you walk away.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.005
I watched you go over the edge
and I didn't do anything to stop you.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.529
You couldn't have.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.365
Sure, I could.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.207
But I just didn't want to.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.203
But I want to now.

35:12.400 --> 35:15.290
Whenever you go too far,
I will be there to pull you back.

35:15.480 --> 35:16.891
Every second.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.890
Every day until you don't need me.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.204
Why?

35:27.120 --> 35:29.566
Because right now...

35:31.720 --> 35:33.882
you're all I've got.

35:48.360 --> 35:50.601
Hey, I was gonna make some coffee.

35:50.800 --> 35:54.009
I'm good. Gonna head to bed in a few.

35:57.240 --> 36:00.722
Hey, listen, Elena, the, uh...

36:02.160 --> 36:05.482
The sheriff told me about
everything you did today...

36:05.720 --> 36:08.291
and while I appreciate it...

36:08.480 --> 36:11.848
I don't want you getting in trouble
because of me, okay?

36:12.320 --> 36:15.483
If not for you, for who?

36:15.680 --> 36:19.321
Well, still, I'm the one
who's supposed to look after you...

36:19.520 --> 36:22.126
even if I suck at it.

36:22.840 --> 36:28.085
Okay, well, how about we just agree
to take care of each other, then?

36:31.720 --> 36:33.370
Deal.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.890
What are you reading there?

36:36.440 --> 36:37.680
Old family journal.

36:38.440 --> 36:41.364
- Any juicy family secrets?
- It's hard to tell.

36:41.560 --> 36:44.689
I mean, at first I thought
it was Johnathan Gilbert's journal...

36:44.880 --> 36:47.042
but it ended up
being his granddaughter's...

36:47.240 --> 36:50.687
who apparently
went just as crazy as he did.

36:51.880 --> 36:54.486
So great genes, huh?

36:54.680 --> 36:57.524
Well, at least you have something
to look forward to.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.961
- Good night, Ric.
- Good night.

37:09.920 --> 37:14.050
So I, uh, dug into the old family archives
from the early 1900s.

37:14.240 --> 37:16.208
So now you want to be helpful?

37:18.400 --> 37:20.687
Want me to go back
to being mad at you?

37:23.960 --> 37:27.487
- What did you find?
- Well, nothing from 1912.

37:27.720 --> 37:30.291
They never did arrest anyone
for the Founders' murders.

37:30.480 --> 37:34.087
But they did get a confession
10 years later.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.602
They did? Who?

37:36.800 --> 37:40.247
Johnathan Gilbert's granddaughter,
Samantha.

37:40.480 --> 37:43.643
They assumed she was crazy,
locked her up in an insane asylum.

37:43.840 --> 37:46.127
- Then what?
- Trail ends there.

37:46.360 --> 37:50.251
I mean, she was a Founder. You know
how they like to look out for their own.

37:50.440 --> 37:55.241
Samantha Gilbert. That is very weird.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.646
Why?

37:56.840 --> 37:59.650
Because I'm pretty sure
I had already killed her.

38:02.240 --> 38:05.244
- I know what this looks like.
- Yeah? Well, I sure as hell don't.

38:05.440 --> 38:08.410
You shoot me, have me thrown in jail,
and then have me freed?

38:08.600 --> 38:12.400
I did it for you, Ric. I forged
the coroner's note to clear your name.

38:12.640 --> 38:15.041
Oh, you know what? People are right.
You are psycho.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.561
You've been cleared.
They'll look somewhere else.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.524
They won't look your way again.

38:20.680 --> 38:24.366
Please, you have no reason,
but I need you to trust me anyway.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.690
If you let me in, I can explain.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.325
<i>I don't feel like myself.</i>

38:49.320 --> 38:50.845
<i>I am losing time...</i>

38:51.040 --> 38:53.327
<i>as though I am going mad.</i>

38:55.480 --> 38:58.131
So you think Samantha Gilbert
is still alive...

38:58.320 --> 39:01.290
running around Mystic Falls,
killing Founders?

39:01.520 --> 39:05.206
It's not possible. If she became
a vampire, we'd know about it, right?

39:05.840 --> 39:08.969
Well, then she must have had a ring
that brought her back to life.

39:09.200 --> 39:14.127
I mean, she was a Gilbert. Those rings
were passed on through generations.

39:14.320 --> 39:17.244
Yeah, but even if she had a ring,
she wouldn't be alive today.

39:17.440 --> 39:21.240
- It doesn't protect her from old age.
- Gilbert only made two of those rings.

39:21.440 --> 39:24.523
Jeremy has one of them
and the other is...

39:26.680 --> 39:27.966
Alaric's.

39:30.880 --> 39:34.043
Like the sheriff said, the victims
were killed with your weapons.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.328
What's with the stake?
He's not a vampire.

39:36.560 --> 39:39.609
I know. This was a murder.
- Oh, my God. Dad!

39:39.800 --> 39:41.609
Someone drove this through his heart.

39:41.800 --> 39:44.690
- It's one of ours. But I was attacked.
- With your own knife.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.645
- Could have been self-inflicted.
- It's impossible.

39:47.840 --> 39:50.446
- I would know if I were killing people.
- Would you?

39:50.640 --> 39:53.564
Have you had any blackouts?
Instances of lost time?

39:56.240 --> 39:59.244
- You're insane.
- No, but I think you might be.

40:01.080 --> 40:03.401
You wear a ring
that lets you cheat death, Ric.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.365
How many times can you die
before it changes you?

40:13.080 --> 40:16.243
I think you're sick,
and I want to help you.

40:16.960 --> 40:21.409
This has happened before,
almost a hundred years ago.

40:24.520 --> 40:25.646
Elena.

40:29.920 --> 40:32.491
Ric, I think she's right.
