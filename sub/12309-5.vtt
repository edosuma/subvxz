WEBVTT

00:09.859 --> 00:11.260
What the hell *was* that thing?

00:11.261 --> 00:12.816
It just appeared out of nowhere.

00:12.883 --> 00:14.926
And that shriek scared the crap out of me.

00:14.955 --> 00:16.950
Kind of a...flying monkey.

00:16.960 --> 00:18.755
Flying monkeys! What *is* this, the planet of Oz?

00:18.774 --> 00:21.523
Did it not appear to be *leaping* rather than flying?

00:21.552 --> 00:22.506
That was one hell of a leap.

00:22.573 --> 00:24.129
Well, I said it *looked* like a monkey?

00:24.149 --> 00:26.153
- you know, hair, arms, legs...
- and a beak.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.436
It didn't have a beak!

00:27.437 --> 00:28.749
Look, here? I uploaded it.

00:28.831 --> 00:30.225
There.

00:30.436 --> 00:33.190
- You know, that really clears things up
- What did you expect?

00:33.191 --> 00:35.211
- It was trying to kill me.
- What the hell *is* that thing?

00:35.293 --> 00:36.758
Well, let's send a team of biologists down there

00:36.759 --> 00:38.223
let *them* figure it out.

00:38.387 --> 00:40.286
It might be a good place for an Alpha site.

00:40.391 --> 00:41.938
The planet did seem suitable.

00:41.973 --> 00:45.090
Good climate; abundant food and water; excellent choice for an offworld base.

00:45.183 --> 00:46.730
Aside from the flying monkeys!

00:46.754 --> 00:49.250
All right, we're coming into range, Rodney.

00:56.214 --> 00:57.069
Rodney?

00:57.128 --> 00:59.343
Oh, *serious* power spike!

00:59.344 --> 01:00.233
That's strange.

01:00.327 --> 01:01.417
What's wrong?

01:01.418 --> 01:02.050
I don't know.

01:02.051 --> 01:03.960
I mean, these readings are all screwy.

01:03.961 --> 01:05.601
- I just lost steering.
- Really?

01:05.602 --> 01:07.148
The drive pods won't retract.

01:07.149 --> 01:07.722
*Do* something.

01:07.781 --> 01:09.621
I *could* if I knew what the problem was.

01:09.622 --> 01:10.113
Rodney.

01:10.114 --> 01:11.801
Just-just-just hang on, hang on.

01:11.802 --> 01:14.156
- Yeah, but if those pods don't retract...
- I know, I know!

01:14.157 --> 01:16.600
- Just-just give me a second.
- We don't *have* a second.

01:17.628 --> 01:19.316
What the hell?

01:20.898 --> 01:22.351
We just lost power.

01:22.352 --> 01:24.343
All right, you'd better hold on.

OK, good, good.

02:50.116 --> 02:51.041
I was wrong.

02:51.181 --> 02:53.736
We still have power; we're just not getting any to the primary systems...

02:53.806 --> 02:55.693
or the secondary systems either.

02:55.694 --> 02:58.131
- Why not?
- I don't know. It's some kind of interference.

02:55.869 --> 02:58.107
<font color="#ffff00">Ghost in the Machine</font>

02:58.154 --> 03:00.322
I'm getting spikes all over the place.

03:00.369 --> 03:01.764
It's completely haywire.

03:01.810 --> 03:03.767
Thank God the inertial dampeners weren't affected.

03:03.768 --> 03:05.139
Well, not *yet*.

03:06.510 --> 03:07.775
What the hell *is* that?

03:07.796 --> 03:09.015
It's displacement current

03:09.016 --> 03:10.490
high voltage. Do not let it hit you.

03:10.491 --> 03:11.299
Oh, you *think*?

03:11.310 --> 03:12.763
Perhaps it's something we picked up on the planet.

03:12.787 --> 03:13.900
That is doubtful, OK?

03:13.947 --> 03:15.248
There was nothing technological

03:15.249 --> 03:18.459
I mean Ancient or other on that planet.
It was totally primordial.

03:18.529 --> 03:20.732
I didn't detect anything unusual in the planet's magnetosphere.

03:20.733 --> 03:24.142
Look, it's gotta be some kind of a of a glitch in the Jumper's capacitor.

03:24.248 --> 03:26.545
Just give me a second, I'll figure out how to...

03:27.248 --> 03:28.361
Oh no.

03:28.490 --> 03:29.791
What?

03:30.201 --> 03:32.884
Hitting the Gate decreased our speed, which means we're in decaying orbit.

03:33.224 --> 03:35.931
Look, if we don't get power back, we're gonna burn up in the atmosphere.

03:36.084 --> 03:39.084
All right, try to get the D.H.D. working, we can dial the Gate, radio for help.

03:39.224 --> 03:43.115
Well, I'll try, but the radio communications were affected as well.

03:44.369 --> 03:45.611
The drive pods are powering up.

03:45.670 --> 03:47.697
Only one of them, and it wasn't anything *I* did.

03:47.698 --> 03:49.241
I mean, it just came back online.

03:49.242 --> 03:50.952
- By itself?
- It doesn't make any difference.

03:50.953 --> 03:53.905
Keep working on that D.H.D.
I'm gonna and get us back in range.

04:01.702 --> 04:03.682
OK, I've got bad news and I've got good news.

04:03.683 --> 04:04.514
What is it?

04:04.515 --> 04:06.430
Slim to no chance of getting the D.H.D. working.

04:06.431 --> 04:08.247
The system is completely out of whack.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.497
It's gonna take some incredibly intricate rerouting to the power...

04:10.498 --> 04:12.618
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What's the *good* news?

04:12.852 --> 04:16.168
That *was* the good news. The bad news is we lost life support.

04:16.286 --> 04:17.786
So, no air.

04:17.973 --> 04:19.755
Right. That's-that's why it's bad.

04:19.755 --> 04:20.950
All right. We're back in range.

04:20.951 --> 04:23.844
Just keep working on the D.H.D. This may be our last shot.

04:26.431 --> 04:27.462
What just happened?

04:27.463 --> 04:29.009
I don't know, but we're back online.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.017
D.H.D.?

04:30.269 --> 04:34.042
Everything! We've got propulsion, life support, you name it.

04:37.869 --> 04:39.849
Atlantis, this is Sheppard.

04:39.896 --> 04:42.052
We're coming in for approach but our systems are a little whacked.

04:42.103 --> 04:43.732
If we're not there in about ten seconds

04:43.733 --> 04:45.033
send a Jumper for us.

04:45.034 --> 04:45.877
Copy that, Colonel.

04:45.878 --> 04:47.939
You'd better brace yourself again.

05:05.187 --> 05:07.191
Any of the other Jumpers reporting trouble?

05:07.238 --> 05:09.664
No. Probably an isolated incident

05:09.665 --> 05:11.398
but McKay and Zelenka are checking into it.

05:11.399 --> 05:14.586
We should probably ground the Jumpers `til we know what the problem is, though.

05:14.587 --> 05:15.418
All right.

05:15.465 --> 05:17.539
But the planet suitable for an Alpha site?

05:17.586 --> 05:18.547
Yeah, perfect

05:18.582 --> 05:22.097
well, except for the monkey-like creature flying around,

05:22.098 --> 05:23.926
- but I think we can handle that.
- Monkey?

05:23.927 --> 05:27.196
Yeah. McKay's got some photos, he'll show `em to you.

05:28.074 --> 05:29.950
Did you say "flying"?

05:32.340 --> 05:34.614
So, how's it going, boys? D'you get it fixed?

05:34.660 --> 05:36.196
- There's nothing *to* fix.
- What?

05:36.197 --> 05:38.135
We ran a battery of tests. The Jumper's in perfect condition.

05:38.136 --> 05:39.580
How come the systems were all screwy?

05:39.581 --> 05:40.259
You got me.

05:40.260 --> 05:42.802
We couldn't recreate any of the so-called anomalies.

05:42.803 --> 05:43.892
Hey, Sammy Sceptic.

05:43.893 --> 05:46.951
He saw it too, as did Ronon and Teyla.
All of our primary systems went down.

05:46.952 --> 05:47.865
That's OK. I believe you.

05:47.866 --> 05:48.814
I don't think you do.

05:49.177 --> 05:52.998
It's just that I think that maybe the problem might have been caused by something that you unwittingly...

05:52.999 --> 05:55.283
I didn't do anything ? wittingly or "un"!

05:55.341 --> 05:57.439
OK, OK. There's nothing wrong with the Jumper.

05:57.509 --> 05:58.810
Well, not any more!

05:58.811 --> 06:01.142
- Well, I don't think there ever *was* anything...
- OK, enough!

06:32.602 --> 06:34.418
Oh, please!

06:35.867 --> 06:37.765
Control Room, this is Richard Woolsey.

06:38.011 --> 06:40.988
I took a wrong turn in a transporter and ended up...

06:41.597 --> 06:43.308
I have no idea where I am.

06:43.765 --> 06:45.429
But now the transporter door won't open.

06:45.430 --> 06:48.453
Can you locate me and open it, please?

06:50.815 --> 06:52.503
Hello?

06:57.006 --> 06:58.120
Rodney?

06:58.378 --> 06:59.432
Go ahead.

06:59.479 --> 07:02.420
Are you messin' around with the power again? The lights are flickering.

07:02.502 --> 07:05.397
Yeah, I'm getting reports from all over the place...

07:05.784 --> 07:07.026
Hello?

07:09.564 --> 07:11.088
Rodney?

07:11.193 --> 07:12.728
- Have you noticed...
- Yes.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.573
- Well, do you have any...
- Not yet.

07:14.849 --> 07:17.656
- Is it localised
- No. There are power disruptions all over the city.

07:17.831 --> 07:20.386
- ZedP.M.?
- Still online, plenty of power.

07:20.491 --> 07:22.624
It's just suddenly become...

07:22.694 --> 07:24.135
unstable.

07:24.229 --> 07:26.549
Sounds not unlike what you said happened in the Puddle Jumper.

07:26.550 --> 07:29.057
Yes, remarkably not unlike it.

07:29.690 --> 07:31.460
Well, perhaps the anomaly's spread to the city's systems.

07:31.461 --> 07:32.292
Naah, it's impossible.

07:32.293 --> 07:36.241
I disabled the network connection between the Jumper and Atlantis before we even came through the Gate.

07:39.447 --> 07:40.607
So.

07:40.924 --> 07:42.857
Coincidence, then?

07:45.670 --> 07:47.299
Hey, I tried to radio you.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.572
Yeah, communications are down.

07:48.573 --> 07:50.072
Yeah, obviously. What's up?

07:50.073 --> 07:50.845
We're working on it.

07:50.846 --> 07:53.449
Well, I just almost got zapped by a bolt of lightning.

07:53.450 --> 07:54.504
What, displacement current here?

07:54.505 --> 07:56.696
Yeah, right there in the corridor, just like the one we had in the Jumper.

07:56.697 --> 07:58.442
So, *not* a coincidence.

07:58.443 --> 08:00.129
We just lost power to the Stargate.

08:00.235 --> 08:01.137
What?

08:01.138 --> 08:04.289
Maybe a virus uploaded itself or something.

08:04.290 --> 08:06.656
No-no, I disabled the Jumper's network connection for this very reason.

08:06.657 --> 08:09.692
There is no way the anomaly jumped to the city's systems.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.817
You'd better figure it out,

08:17.852 --> 08:20.993
because whatever was in that Jumper is now in the city.

08:27.925 --> 08:29.120
Where've *you* been?

08:29.234 --> 08:30.781
On the other side of the city.

08:30.782 --> 08:33.429
A transporter malfunctioned and sent me to the East Pier.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.941
I had to walk all the way back.

08:35.023 --> 08:37.131
We've got power disruptions all over the city.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.254
Look, nearly every system's affected.

08:39.255 --> 08:41.879
We think whatever's wrong with the Jumper has infected Atlantis.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.941
It's one of several possibilities we're looking into.

08:43.942 --> 08:44.961
"Several"?

08:45.019 --> 08:46.859
It's a possibility, all right?

08:46.860 --> 08:49.121
Look, the point is, we have no idea what's going on here.

08:49.122 --> 08:50.632
I was almost hit by a bolt of lightning.

08:50.633 --> 08:51.910
Yeah, join the club!

08:52.004 --> 08:56.574
Look, the energy builds up in one area and then discharges in a high-voltage displacement current.

08:56.645 --> 08:58.473
Very erratic, and very lethal.

08:58.567 --> 08:59.727
I tried to radio you.

08:59.728 --> 09:01.555
Yeah, well, communications are also down.

09:01.556 --> 09:03.348
So's the Stargate.

09:03.969 --> 09:05.153
We can't dial Earth?

09:05.154 --> 09:06.899
Don't worry, all right?

09:07.098 --> 09:11.376
I will figure it out. I've just gotta run a few diagnostics, narrow down the...

09:16.957 --> 09:19.031
Well, *that* can't be good.

09:24.201 --> 09:26.100
OK, OK.

09:26.862 --> 09:30.237
We need to organise some teams, fan out through the city, keep everyone calm

09:30.238 --> 09:32.487
until we figure out exactly what the...

09:32.488 --> 09:33.647
Hey

09:36.395 --> 09:38.282
the laptop just booted up.

09:38.342 --> 09:39.971
It's probably just the battery.

09:40.018 --> 09:42.186
No-no-no-no, it's drawing power from the system.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.963
So everything's out except *your* computer?

09:44.964 --> 09:47.506
I am as confused as you are.

09:53.438 --> 09:54.563
What is that?

09:54.564 --> 09:57.024
Looks like some kind of a code.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.265
Maybe.

09:58.266 --> 09:59.308
Could be a message.

10:07.354 --> 10:08.819
"Help"?

10:10.748 --> 10:13.080
"Who are you?"

10:15.764 --> 10:18.799
"Elizabeth Weir"

10:28.910 --> 10:30.468
Doctor Weir?

10:31.734 --> 10:33.433
But she's dead.

10:33.890 --> 10:35.906
So we've been told.

10:39.398 --> 10:40.898
Perhaps

10:41.156 --> 10:43.359
you should answer her.

10:45.058 --> 10:46.652
Right.

10:49.397 --> 10:51.986
"Where are you?"

10:52.045 --> 10:54.330
"computer"

10:54.986 --> 10:57.541
In the computer? How can she be in the computer?

10:58.901 --> 11:01.854
"difficult current condition"

11:04.947 --> 11:07.350
"What happened to you?"

11:09.354 --> 11:10.877
"subspace"

11:11.041 --> 11:15.518
"difficult control"

11:15.623 --> 11:19.279
"trying to"

11:25.683 --> 11:28.695
"Did you do that ?"

11:35.058 --> 11:39.710
"Are you still there?"

11:41.030 --> 11:43.479
"help me"

11:49.368 --> 11:50.914
Right. Rodney?

11:51.993 --> 11:53.528
Rodney, come in.

11:55.180 --> 11:56.739
Rodney, can you hear me?

11:56.740 --> 11:57.676
Go ahead.

11:58.016 --> 11:59.118
I've completed the patch.

11:59.317 --> 12:01.232
Go ahead and try it whenever you're ready.

12:01.291 --> 12:03.318
OK. Fingers crossed.

12:03.369 --> 12:04.470
What are you doing?

12:04.529 --> 12:08.513
Well, whatever this entity is, it's completely overwhelming the city's systems.

12:08.631 --> 12:10.213
Now, it's spread out.

12:10.248 --> 12:14.947
It's like dozens of fragmented programmes that are fouling up power management,

12:14.948 --> 12:16.670
communications you name it.

12:16.728 --> 12:21.697
Now, I've managed to merge them, to patch them together into one incredibly large programme

12:21.698 --> 12:25.295
that will hopefully render our systems slightly more stable

12:25.296 --> 12:28.658
and allow us to better communicate with whoever or...

12:28.798 --> 12:31.189
whatever is that's claiming to be Doctor Weir.

12:31.190 --> 12:34.295
Isn't merging all these programmes potentially dangerous?

12:34.296 --> 12:35.209
Well, *hell*, yeah!

12:35.279 --> 12:38.537
But it's no more dangerous than allowing this thing to continue wreaking havoc on the city's systems.

12:38.538 --> 12:40.082
Or getting zapped by bolts of lighting.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.265
OK, so...

12:41.266 --> 12:45.461
Let me see if I can synthesise a voice to communicate with "Elizabeth".

12:45.555 --> 12:47.371
If I make the proper calibrations,

12:47.372 --> 12:49.844
she should be able to hear us too.

12:51.215 --> 12:52.644
Now...

12:53.394 --> 12:54.672
Elizabeth?

12:54.801 --> 12:56.195
Rodney.

12:57.660 --> 13:00.894
Is it just me, or does "Elizabeth" sound a little different?

13:00.895 --> 13:02.746
I'm on it. I'm on it.

13:02.982 --> 13:07.236
Let...me...do...that...

13:10.130 --> 13:11.841
Are you Elizabeth Weir?

13:11.842 --> 13:13.951
Yes, Rodney. It's me.

13:14.033 --> 13:16.259
It's the best I can do.

13:16.482 --> 13:18.193
I'm sorry to cause all this trouble.

13:18.194 --> 13:19.318
Who's there with you?

13:19.319 --> 13:21.134
Is John Sheppard there?

13:23.259 --> 13:24.103
Hi.

13:24.150 --> 13:26.950
It's so good to hear your voice again.

13:27.033 --> 13:28.638
We, uh...

13:29.271 --> 13:31.380
thought you were...

13:31.474 --> 13:32.365
dead.

13:32.555 --> 13:36.551
I suppose I am, my...
my physical body, anyway, but

13:36.644 --> 13:38.801
my consciousness is still intact.

13:38.802 --> 13:41.379
Right. So, um, what happened?

13:41.449 --> 13:44.109
Do you remember the day I ordered you to leave me behind?

13:44.110 --> 13:45.035
Come on!

13:45.036 --> 13:46.172
Elizabeth!

13:46.173 --> 13:47.648
*Go!

13:51.950 --> 13:54.036
Yeah, I remember.

13:54.106 --> 13:57.082
Well, after that, the Replicators took me to a lab.

13:57.083 --> 14:00.469
The nanites in my body were unleashed and allowed to replicate.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.391
I joined the population.

14:02.392 --> 14:06.364
But even in my new form, my original consciousness was still there.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.028
I was still me.

14:08.122 --> 14:09.305
I tried to hide it

14:09.306 --> 14:11.450
but a few of the others could sense it.

14:12.786 --> 14:15.317
They were remnants of Niam's old group.

14:16.137 --> 14:18.540
I believe you encountered some of their handiwork

14:18.704 --> 14:22.043
Replicator-built human versions of me and your team.

14:23.470 --> 14:25.615
Hmm. You heard about that, did you?

14:25.791 --> 14:28.439
Only after they were killed.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.892
Now, the other you, the human one

14:32.893 --> 14:34.861
She thought you'd been destroyed.

14:35.002 --> 14:37.861
That's what the leaders of our group wanted her to believe.

14:37.862 --> 14:41.189
They kept us apart deliberately for security reasons.

14:41.295 --> 14:43.978
This is all very interesting, I'm sure,

14:43.979 --> 14:49.875
but none of it explains how you've come to be a disembodied voice in our computer system.

14:50.021 --> 14:52.458
Is that Richard Woolsey?

14:52.493 --> 14:54.310
Uh, yes.

14:54.931 --> 14:57.532
Uh, I'm the, uh, the-the

14:57.650 --> 14:59.947
- the new...
- The new you.

15:00.099 --> 15:01.669
I see.

15:03.295 --> 15:06.810
So, what-what... what happened?
How did you...

15:07.408 --> 15:10.982
end up... in there?

15:11.530 --> 15:13.276
We were on the run.

15:13.277 --> 15:17.366
Oberoth and the others were hunting us down for our heretical beliefs.

15:17.518 --> 15:21.503
It was only a matter of time before we'd be captured and destroyed,

15:21.690 --> 15:24.233
unless something miraculous happened.

15:24.327 --> 15:25.804
And something did.

15:30.514 --> 15:33.654
Our intel was correct. The planet has been completely destroyed.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.350
Can you detect any trace Replicator cells?

15:36.467 --> 15:39.420
Negative. They've been completely wiped out.

15:40.146 --> 15:41.365
Good.

15:42.057 --> 15:45.959
We can finally get to work without having to look over our shoulders.

15:47.615 --> 15:49.936
It's time to begin.

15:52.645 --> 15:55.153
Uh, well, that wasn't a miracle that was us.

15:55.154 --> 15:57.778
We destroyed the Replicator homeworld.

15:57.779 --> 16:01.142
I know, and we owe you a debt of gratitude

16:01.235 --> 16:04.692
because it allowed us to pursue our goal in peace.

16:04.704 --> 16:05.946
You mean ascension?

16:05.947 --> 16:07.470
Exactly, Teyla.

16:08.208 --> 16:11.501
We found a suitable planet and began our work.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.704
I did what I could to help them.

16:13.810 --> 16:18.099
I tried to lead them in meditation to teach them how to release their burden.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.424
But it was difficult.

16:22.228 --> 16:25.064
Let me guess. You ran into the small hiccup of the fact that you're all machines.

16:25.721 --> 16:26.928
Yes.

16:27.291 --> 16:31.006
Well, much as I'd like to say we didn't see *that* coming, we...

16:30.507 --> 16:32.381
you know, did.

16:32.428 --> 16:34.326
One of our group, Koracen,

16:34.327 --> 16:38.322
argued that it was a mistake to try and run away from our technological origin

16:38.379 --> 16:42.269
that we should embrace it and find a technological solution.

16:42.375 --> 16:47.121
We know that a Replicator mind can be digitised and transferred from one body to another,

16:47.730 --> 16:54.222
but I've discovered a way that will allow us to exist indefinitely as fields of energy,

16:54.375 --> 16:57.164
effectively uploading ourselves into sub-space

16:57.363 --> 17:01.898
where we'll be free to move about the galaxy unencumbered by physical existence.

17:02.016 --> 17:04.207
What will happen to our bodies?

17:04.208 --> 17:06.915
The nanite bonds holding them together will be severed.

17:06.973 --> 17:08.825
- You mean they'll be destroyed.
- Yes

17:08.872 --> 17:10.523
but we'll no longer need them.

17:10.641 --> 17:12.815
- Koracen, if this doesn't work...
- It *will* work.

17:14.888 --> 17:20.607
You told us that ascension is achieved when the physical body is transformed into pure energy.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.079
I can make that happen for us.

17:23.326 --> 17:25.060
Once in sub-space,

17:25.236 --> 17:29.514
nothing can prevent us from continuing on to the next plane of existence.

17:30.533 --> 17:32.467
Are you ready?

17:45.734 --> 17:46.859
It's done.

17:49.968 --> 17:51.972
Machine ascension!

17:52.511 --> 17:54.327
Except it didn't work.

17:54.503 --> 17:56.472
There *was* no next step

17:56.518 --> 17:59.975
no ascension in any meaningful sense of the word.

18:00.093 --> 18:03.140
We've been stuck in sub-space ever since.

18:03.186 --> 18:04.311
What is it like?

18:04.323 --> 18:05.179
Oh.

18:05.565 --> 18:09.163
Constant motion and deafening noise.

18:09.272 --> 18:12.166
It's like the worst migraine you could possibly imagine.

18:12.249 --> 18:14.510
I don't know. I've had some pretty horrendous migraines in my time.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.444
We started searching the galaxy,

18:16.445 --> 18:19.795
looking for a way to regain any kind of physical form.

18:19.959 --> 18:23.323
We came across a few other technologically advanced societies.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.081
Really? In *this* galaxy?

18:25.280 --> 18:27.858
You'd be surprised how many more are out there,

18:27.928 --> 18:30.131
keeping themselves hidden from the Wraith.

18:30.424 --> 18:34.866
We occupied various computer systems even Wraith tech for a short while.

18:34.913 --> 18:36.588
- Wraith tech?
- Really?

18:36.617 --> 18:39.184
It was extremely unpleasant.

18:39.430 --> 18:41.211
In fact, no matter where we looked,

18:41.281 --> 18:47.527
we couldn't find any technology that would allow us to exist as anything even remotely like what we were before.

18:48.137 --> 18:49.848
Which is why you came here.

18:50.070 --> 18:54.406
You knew that Atlantis' computers were big enough and powerful enough to house your entire programme.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.453
The others were growing increasingly frustrated and bitter.

18:57.535 --> 19:00.898
I broke away from them and started looking for you on my own.

19:00.969 --> 19:02.867
I searched the galaxy for months,

19:02.868 --> 19:05.574
then I detected your Puddle Jumper and connected with it.

19:05.797 --> 19:07.988
Nearly killing us in the process.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.910
I'm sorry for that.

19:10.309 --> 19:13.250
My current condition is extremely volatile

19:13.320 --> 19:14.773
difficult to control,

19:14.832 --> 19:18.594
especially during the initial moments trying to interface with new tech.

19:18.595 --> 19:20.973
But I didn't know where else to turn.

19:21.148 --> 19:23.785
You're the only friends I have.

19:30.666 --> 19:31.837
If you ask me, it's a trick

19:31.931 --> 19:33.408
someone just pretending to be Doctor Weir.

19:33.409 --> 19:35.037
But what if it *is* her?

19:35.271 --> 19:37.544
Look, we still have the Ancient machine I used to build FRAN.

19:37.603 --> 19:39.748
- I can easily build another Replicator to house...
- No!

19:39.987 --> 19:41.769
I'd put in failsafes, a kill switch.

19:41.770 --> 19:44.570
Look, what I'm saying is that with all of the advancements I've been able to make...

19:44.571 --> 19:47.863
With all due respects to the advancements you've made, one thing remains constant:

19:47.864 --> 19:51.542
Replicators are far too powerful to even *think* about trusting them.

19:51.683 --> 19:53.113
They've been the scourge of two galaxies.

19:53.114 --> 19:55.292
You know better than anyone how difficult it was to get rid of them.

19:55.293 --> 19:56.698
Then what should we do with her?

19:56.699 --> 19:58.116
She can't stay where she is.

19:58.163 --> 19:59.734
She's frying the city's computers.

19:59.991 --> 20:04.363
Well, maybe we can upload her, or it, or whatever this thing is

20:04.409 --> 20:07.058
into a virtual reality like we did with Ava.

20:07.128 --> 20:10.409
That could work, but it wouldn't be easy, especially if she doesn't wanna go.

20:10.609 --> 20:12.835
Well, talk to her.

20:13.116 --> 20:16.913
Rodney, we've just detected anomalous energy levels in the South Pier lab.

20:16.914 --> 20:18.155
What, the Replicator machine?

20:18.226 --> 20:19.820
She's building herself a body.

20:19.821 --> 20:21.202
She must have found it in the database.

20:21.214 --> 20:22.831
- Shut down power.
- I-I tried.

20:22.832 --> 20:26.323
I've also tried to radio down there but communications are still offline.

20:29.463 --> 20:30.987
What's going on?

20:31.174 --> 20:32.288
Doors slammed shut.

20:32.323 --> 20:34.033
- Can't get it open.
- OK, move.

20:34.139 --> 20:35.838
Go get some back-up, some heavy arms;

20:35.839 --> 20:37.303
and clear every corridor out of here.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.873
And get some C4, we're gonna have to blast this door.

20:38.874 --> 20:40.854
Yeah, this panel is toast.

20:42.330 --> 20:43.983
Is there another door we can access?

20:48.940 --> 20:50.404
Hello.

20:56.950 --> 20:58.040
Listen to me.

20:58.041 --> 20:59.610
I'm Elizabeth Weir.

20:59.634 --> 21:00.899
Obviously she was in a hurry.

21:00.900 --> 21:03.935
She just used the previous Replicator template that was already in the machine...

21:03.958 --> 21:05.071
which was FRAN.

21:05.072 --> 21:07.521
John, I'm not a threat to you.

21:07.755 --> 21:11.702
Well, whatever you are, I'd say building a Replicator body's a pretty big threat.

21:11.878 --> 21:13.753
Elizabeth Weir would never do such a thing.

21:13.799 --> 21:17.620
OK, the machine is deactivated.

21:17.714 --> 21:20.702
I've removed the control crystal, which means no-one will be building any more Replicators.

21:20.703 --> 21:21.756
Believe me,

21:21.757 --> 21:24.487
I was just as concerned about doing this as you,

21:24.639 --> 21:28.881
but the adjustments Rodney's made to this technology eliminate any danger.

21:28.951 --> 21:30.569
I can't replicate,

21:30.570 --> 21:33.440
and since my consciousness is controlling this body I truly...

21:33.441 --> 21:34.518
*Your* consciousness?

21:34.623 --> 21:38.362
No offence, but I'm not completely sold on your being who you say you are.

21:38.573 --> 21:40.588
That makes two of us.

21:41.186 --> 21:42.955
I understand your scepticism,

21:42.956 --> 21:45.463
but I *am* Elizabeth Weir.

21:46.037 --> 21:47.948
I wish there was some way I could prove it to you.

21:47.949 --> 21:49.401
That'll be difficult.

21:49.471 --> 21:55.514
Any personal information or memories could have easily been mined from Doctor Weir's consciousness when the Replicators captured her.

21:55.573 --> 21:56.815
I know.

21:57.225 --> 21:59.721
At least let me start by offering something of value.

21:59.722 --> 22:01.210
Let's hear it.

22:01.737 --> 22:05.909
The technical specs of several of the systems we've inhabited since our transformation,

22:06.003 --> 22:07.772
including Wraith tech.

22:09.343 --> 22:11.968
I've already uploaded them to your computer.

22:12.155 --> 22:13.011
Oh, really?

22:13.023 --> 22:14.956
Well, that's... great.

22:14.957 --> 22:18.519
All I ask is that you give me a chance to earn your trust.

22:19.585 --> 22:22.866
I would never *ever* do anything to harm any of you,

22:22.867 --> 22:24.407
or Atlantis.

22:35.080 --> 22:38.043
Well, the good news is that now she's downloaded herself into the Replicator's body

22:38.163 --> 22:40.318
she's not screwing up Atlantis' computers.

22:40.353 --> 22:43.764
Power's stable, the Gate's working and communications are back online.

22:43.834 --> 22:45.662
You sure she can't replicate on her own?

22:45.663 --> 22:47.900
Positive. I mean, she instituted every safeguard.

22:48.017 --> 22:51.205
- If we move her to a secure location, then I think we'll be able...
- Wait a minute.

22:51.802 --> 22:55.177
You're not suggesting I entertain the notion of keeping her here?

22:55.224 --> 22:58.517
Well, I'm just saying that if we keep her under constant guard, it'll minimise any threat she poses

22:58.518 --> 23:00.275
if she even *poses* a threat

23:00.276 --> 23:03.533
and it'll give us more time to study her.

23:04.599 --> 23:07.588
That *thing* in there is a Replicator.

23:07.589 --> 23:09.650
There are far too many ways this can go wrong,

23:09.651 --> 23:11.677
even if she's kept under constant guard.

23:11.678 --> 23:13.599
Everyone doubted the first FRAN I built,

23:13.600 --> 23:16.171
and she turned out to be perfectly safe and perfectly reliable.

23:16.172 --> 23:17.577
That's right, *you* built FRAN;

23:17.682 --> 23:19.499
*you* created her consciousness.

23:19.557 --> 23:24.819
Now, as much as you wanna believe that this new FRAN is indeed Doctor Weir, we *cannot* be certain of that.

23:24.936 --> 23:27.304
For all we know, it could be Oberoth inside that body.

23:27.374 --> 23:28.979
That's creepy.

23:29.530 --> 23:31.323
What if it *is* Doctor Weir?

23:32.161 --> 23:33.251
Look, this is my fault.

23:33.252 --> 23:35.572
I'm the one who reactivated the nanites in Elizabeth

23:35.654 --> 23:37.798
true, to save her, but...

23:38.279 --> 23:40.423
Look, I'm the one who created this mess.

23:40.634 --> 23:44.408
I think I should be the one to, you know, fix it.

23:46.517 --> 23:48.204
I owe it to Elizabeth.

23:51.126 --> 23:52.567
I'm sorry,

23:53.071 --> 23:55.286
but it's too dangerous.

23:56.376 --> 23:58.614
I say we stick with our original plan:

23:58.731 --> 24:01.180
upload her consciousness into a virtual reality,

24:01.181 --> 24:03.243
let her prove herself there,

24:03.599 --> 24:06.622
where she can't do any damage.

24:15.223 --> 24:16.500
A child?

24:16.664 --> 24:17.954
Oh, Teyla!

24:21.528 --> 24:23.614
I'm so happy for you.

24:25.711 --> 24:28.535
Is it a boy or a...

24:28.688 --> 24:29.895
A boy.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.438
What's his name?

24:33.832 --> 24:36.352
Torren John Emmagan.

24:36.844 --> 24:41.051
Torren for your father, and John

24:41.332 --> 24:42.539
Colonel Sheppard.

24:42.633 --> 24:44.004
Yes.

24:45.475 --> 24:48.065
Wait. You're not saying John Sheppard is...

24:48.066 --> 24:49.085
No.

24:49.225 --> 24:50.315
No.

24:51.288 --> 24:53.292
The father is Athosian.

24:53.385 --> 24:54.604
Let me guess

24:54.686 --> 24:55.952
Kanaan.

24:56.233 --> 24:58.612
Yes! How did you...?

24:58.940 --> 25:02.034
Every time you spoke of him, this friend

25:02.174 --> 25:04.928
there was always a sparkle in your eyes.

25:07.244 --> 25:10.361
So is the baby here with you in Atlantis?

25:11.826 --> 25:13.138
No.

25:13.629 --> 25:16.336
He's with his father, offworld.

25:21.283 --> 25:22.467
Sorry to interrupt.

25:22.560 --> 25:23.803
That's all right.

25:23.804 --> 25:25.080
We were just finishing.

25:34.479 --> 25:35.463
Sorry about all this.

25:35.510 --> 25:37.913
It's OK. I understand.

25:38.721 --> 25:41.100
Amazing news about Teyla.

25:41.862 --> 25:43.174
Yeah.

25:44.370 --> 25:45.448
Yeah.

25:46.069 --> 25:47.721
Um, look,

25:48.061 --> 25:51.987
we all wanna believe you are who you say you are...

25:52.069 --> 25:53.616
I understand.

25:53.944 --> 25:55.889
You have to be cautious.

25:56.381 --> 25:58.842
But it really is me, John.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.443
You just have to give me time.

26:03.952 --> 26:05.769
You'll see that...

26:10.972 --> 26:12.097
Oh no.

26:12.098 --> 26:13.084
What's wrong?

26:13.085 --> 26:15.440
They've found me.

26:16.131 --> 26:17.385
Who?

26:17.772 --> 26:19.530
The other Replicators.

26:19.799 --> 26:22.143
They're on their way to Atlantis.

26:24.429 --> 26:25.449
How many are coming?

26:25.450 --> 26:26.257
Eight of them.

26:26.398 --> 26:28.085
We saw what kind of damage *one* could do.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.433
Should we pull the ZeeP.M.?

26:29.515 --> 26:30.957
As a last resort. We're not there yet.

26:30.980 --> 26:33.875
Meanwhile I'll need to effect any potential countermeasures I can come up with.

26:33.876 --> 26:34.777
How soon will they get here?

26:34.778 --> 26:36.335
Minutes, if that.

26:36.394 --> 26:38.175
Is there anything we can do to protect the city?

26:38.176 --> 26:39.382
Could you put up some kind of firewall?

26:39.383 --> 26:41.152
A firewall won't work. You can't block `em.

26:41.153 --> 26:42.804
They just pop in and out of sub-space.

26:42.805 --> 26:44.750
They're here; they're there, it's impossible to predict.

26:46.027 --> 26:49.156
I could write a programme that immediately quarantines any anomalous behaviour in the system,

26:49.157 --> 26:50.679
like an anti-virus software.

26:50.680 --> 26:52.226
It's gonna take some time, though.

26:52.227 --> 26:53.351
Do what you can.

26:53.375 --> 26:56.621
Keep FRAN, Doctor Weir, whoever she is, under guard.

26:56.761 --> 26:58.976
We won't upload her to the V.R. just yet.

26:59.093 --> 27:01.507
We may need her help dealing with them.

27:05.377 --> 27:06.830
- You set us up.
- No.

27:06.900 --> 27:10.108
I honestly believed I had broken away without them being able to track me.

27:10.155 --> 27:12.217
You tell them to stay away from Atlantis.

27:12.218 --> 27:15.299
I'll try, but it'll get easier as they get closer.

27:15.463 --> 27:17.491
Look, I'm sure they don't intend to hurt anyone.

27:17.492 --> 27:20.280
No, you tell them to keep moving; go someplace else.

27:20.373 --> 27:22.424
It might go...

27:23.659 --> 27:24.878
Sheppard!

27:25.171 --> 27:26.471
Go ahead, Rodney.

27:30.186 --> 27:31.100
Rodney?

27:31.101 --> 27:34.053
Their combined forces are completely overwhelming the main power grid.

27:34.393 --> 27:35.635
Sheppard!

27:35.706 --> 27:36.608
They're here.

27:36.609 --> 27:38.682
All eight of them, slamming the city's computers.

27:38.683 --> 27:40.112
What about the anti-virus programme?

27:40.113 --> 27:41.213
I didn't have time to finish it.

27:41.214 --> 27:42.315
Look, it probably wouldn't have worked anyway.

27:42.316 --> 27:46.100
Radek, I need you to pull the ZedP.M.
and power down all the central naqahdah generators.

27:46.171 --> 27:47.647
Radek?

27:48.549 --> 27:50.307
Communications are down again!

27:50.308 --> 27:51.221
Rodney?

27:51.887 --> 27:55.543
Rodney, I'm trying to divert power but it's become far too unstable.

27:55.826 --> 27:58.307
Perhaps now we should pull the ZedP.M.?

28:01.835 --> 28:03.276
Let's go. Pull the ZedP.M.

28:03.277 --> 28:05.655
Shut down all the power except for the main tower.

28:10.473 --> 28:11.610
Hey.

28:14.905 --> 28:17.554
Oh God. He's dead.

28:19.963 --> 28:23.244
We've established contact with the Replicator known as Koracen.

28:23.303 --> 28:25.190
He claims to speak on the others' behalf.

28:25.260 --> 28:26.971
Koracen, it's Elizabeth Weir.

28:26.972 --> 28:29.455
Elizabeth. We were worried about you.

28:29.456 --> 28:30.627
Listen to me.

28:30.686 --> 28:32.502
You need to leave this place.

28:32.538 --> 28:34.260
You're causing a lot of harm.

28:34.284 --> 28:35.373
We *will* do.

28:35.384 --> 28:37.082
But first we wish to be given bodies, as you have.

28:37.104 --> 28:39.471
We've already told you that's out of the question.

28:39.530 --> 28:41.441
And yet Elizabeth has been given one.

28:41.499 --> 28:42.987
It wasn't our choice,

28:43.058 --> 28:45.038
and we're not planning on letting her keep it.

28:45.039 --> 28:47.124
We do not wish to harm anyone.

28:47.277 --> 28:51.530
One of our guys is already dead, so you can save your "we come in peace" crap.

28:51.531 --> 28:53.113
Koracen, please.

28:53.171 --> 28:56.113
Just leave the city and let me negotiate with them.

28:56.114 --> 28:58.714
I'm sure we can figure out some way to help you.

28:58.737 --> 29:02.195
The way to help us is by replacing the control crystal in the Ancient machine

29:02.196 --> 29:04.573
so that we may build Replicator bodies.

29:04.820 --> 29:06.823
That is what you *will* do.

29:06.824 --> 29:08.230
And if we don't?

29:09.155 --> 29:10.409
Koracen?

29:12.835 --> 29:13.503
Not good.

29:13.504 --> 29:14.593
Not good.

29:14.769 --> 29:16.023
Uh, Gate's down again.

29:16.024 --> 29:17.593
We're losing control of the city.

29:17.710 --> 29:19.573
They just shut the Jumper Bay doors.

29:19.574 --> 29:22.011
They're trying to keep us from leaving.

29:22.316 --> 29:23.206
Can't you over-ride it?

29:23.207 --> 29:24.659
I'm locked out!

29:25.538 --> 29:26.347
Oh no.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.034
They just engaged the ZedP.M.

29:28.784 --> 29:30.601
Energy levels are rising rapidly.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.159
Why? What are they doing?

29:32.160 --> 29:34.011
They're sinking the city!

29:34.070 --> 29:35.030
Raise the shield.

29:35.031 --> 29:36.577
They've disabled it.

29:46.730 --> 29:48.102
Any ideas?

29:48.103 --> 29:49.344
No. We're goin' down.

29:49.461 --> 29:52.590
The water's already cresting the lower decks of the outer piers.

29:52.695 --> 29:55.215
It's gonna breach the city corridors any second now.

30:14.909 --> 30:16.936
I want you to send them a message from me.

30:17.194 --> 30:19.046
I've been trying to communicate with them,

30:19.047 --> 30:20.218
telling them to stop.

30:20.219 --> 30:21.647
They won't listen to me.

30:21.648 --> 30:23.007
That's not what I wanna tell them.

30:23.288 --> 30:24.612
Is it not?

30:24.905 --> 30:27.073
Tell them to go ahead.

30:27.354 --> 30:28.901
Sink the city.

30:29.311 --> 30:33.811
Destroy their only chance of ever regaining any kind of physical form.

30:33.911 --> 30:35.563
You've searched the entire galaxy.

30:36.114 --> 30:38.458
You know the Replicator homeworld was destroyed.

30:38.505 --> 30:42.700
The only place remaining with the technology you need achieve your goals

30:43.345 --> 30:45.032
is right here.

30:45.461 --> 30:47.700
So go ahead: destroy it.

30:48.344 --> 30:51.344
Stay trapped in limbo forever.

30:53.536 --> 30:56.899
Level one of the South Pier is completely under water.

30:58.083 --> 30:59.934
They won't stop.

31:00.453 --> 31:01.601
Fine.

31:02.222 --> 31:03.957
Then we'll all die together.

31:22.579 --> 31:24.923
They're powering down the ZedP.M.!

31:26.592 --> 31:28.397
The city's stabilising!

31:35.649 --> 31:36.985
All right.

31:37.454 --> 31:39.165
Now we can negotiate.

31:44.851 --> 31:46.129
I have a proposal.

31:46.152 --> 31:49.937
I've already communicated it to the others and convinced them to agree to it.

31:50.359 --> 31:51.402
Let's hear it.

31:51.461 --> 31:53.008
Human bodies

31:53.137 --> 31:56.160
nanite-manufactured but consisting of flesh and blood,

31:56.394 --> 31:58.562
like the other Elizabeth Weir you once encountered.

31:58.691 --> 32:00.871
Uh, we don't have that kind of technology here.

32:01.082 --> 32:02.160
But *we* do.

32:02.265 --> 32:05.828
If you give us temporary Replicator bodies and a lab to work in,

32:05.980 --> 32:07.293
we can assemble them ourselves.

32:07.351 --> 32:10.281
What, and you'll transfer your consciousness from the Replicator body to the human body?

32:10.282 --> 32:11.312
Exactly.

32:11.500 --> 32:14.840
As human beings, we would be every bit as vulnerable as anyone else.

32:14.980 --> 32:18.262
We would eat, sleep, get sick and die

32:18.379 --> 32:19.973
preferably of old age.

32:19.974 --> 32:23.676
What about ascension?
I'm assuming that's still on the agenda.

32:23.828 --> 32:24.543
It is.

32:24.555 --> 32:25.773
Wait a second.

32:25.855 --> 32:27.742
Building humans, that's gonna take time, isn't it?

32:27.743 --> 32:30.672
I mean, first you have to create the technology to do it.

32:30.707 --> 32:35.535
We're talking nanites organically assembling each body inside out, starting at the molecular level.

32:35.605 --> 32:38.055
Well, then you have to create the machine to transfer the consciousness.

32:38.056 --> 32:39.660
I mean, that's gonna take God knows how long!

32:39.661 --> 32:42.379
Replicators, as you know, work very fast

32:42.484 --> 32:44.512
no need for breaks or food or sleep.

32:44.605 --> 32:46.293
It's worth thinking about.

32:46.294 --> 32:47.699
Look, he may be right,

32:47.793 --> 32:49.598
I mean if only to regain control of the city.

32:49.691 --> 32:52.750
While they're in our computer systems, Atlantis is in serious trouble.

32:53.247 --> 32:54.712
*If* we do this,

32:54.876 --> 32:57.736
I want severe restrictions placed on their capabilities:

32:57.841 --> 32:59.763
no replicating, no shape-shifting...

32:59.764 --> 33:00.841
The basic model. You got it.

33:00.842 --> 33:04.465
I mean, no bells, no whistles. They'll be able to effect some minor repairs but that's about it.

33:04.605 --> 33:07.066
Seal off the lab, put a forcefield around it.

33:07.148 --> 33:09.387
Do whatever you need to do to feel safe,

33:09.782 --> 33:12.993
but I've already convinced the others that this is their only option.

33:13.497 --> 33:15.689
They won't give you any trouble.

33:17.962 --> 33:19.333
You have my word.

33:21.900 --> 33:22.814
Do it.

33:28.633 --> 33:31.012
OK. Initialising forcefield.

33:37.629 --> 33:38.695
Are your teams in place?

33:38.730 --> 33:40.113
Round the clock watch.

33:40.114 --> 33:40.980
Good.

33:41.097 --> 33:45.386
Once these human bodies are made and they're downloaded into them,

33:45.445 --> 33:46.640
what happens then?

33:46.828 --> 33:50.543
Well, seeing as they'll be just like any other human beings, I see no reason not to let them go.

33:50.625 --> 33:51.996
They could become valuable allies.

33:52.008 --> 33:54.422
Or what if one of them decides to stay?

33:55.980 --> 33:58.535
Let's cross one bridge at a time, all right?

34:02.354 --> 34:03.397
How's it going?

34:03.398 --> 34:06.701
Almost done. They're just finishing up the last one.

34:16.237 --> 34:17.292
That was fast.

34:17.293 --> 34:19.553
Actually creating Replicators is fairly simple

34:19.694 --> 34:22.612
comparatively speaking. Humans, not so much.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.581
Well, the sooner they get it done, the better.

34:24.710 --> 34:28.905
And once the last transfer is complete, I want those Replicator bodies destroyed.

34:30.545 --> 34:33.042
They certainly don't waste any time, do they?

34:33.043 --> 34:34.260
No, they don't.

34:34.413 --> 34:37.225
There's no breaks, no chit-chat, no social interaction whatsoever.

34:37.226 --> 34:40.202
Just the perfect working environment.

34:42.686 --> 34:46.061
Ronon, you don't have to stay there the whole time, you know.

34:46.295 --> 34:47.385
I'm good.

34:47.409 --> 34:50.806
Talk, talk, talk, that's all he does. You can't shut him up

34:51.135 --> 34:53.010
Keep me apprised.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.939
McKAY! Power's out!

35:17.940 --> 35:19.143
What the...?

35:19.144 --> 35:19.987
forcefield...

35:44.691 --> 35:47.863
- What happened?
- One of the Replicators escaped. Koracen, the leader.

35:47.945 --> 35:50.473
Must have written some kind of hidden programme that was timed to kill power

35:50.474 --> 35:52.469
as soon as they were downloaded into the Replicator bodies.

35:52.470 --> 35:54.918
It disabled the forcefield and they were able to pry open the doors.

35:55.914 --> 35:57.273
Where is she?

35:57.274 --> 35:58.820
She went after Koracen.

35:58.821 --> 36:01.211
Three teams are in pursuit. We've lost all radio contact.

36:01.212 --> 36:02.430
Go join `em.

36:02.523 --> 36:04.269
Go to the Control Room, try to get the power restored.

36:04.376 --> 36:05.290
What do we do with *them*?

36:05.291 --> 36:06.450
Shoot `em.

36:06.568 --> 36:08.138
*Keep* shooting `em.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.802
They'll go down eventually.

36:09.814 --> 36:11.161
Wait!

36:12.255 --> 36:15.056
We knew nothing of Koracen's plan.

36:15.607 --> 36:18.759
If we were part of it, we would not be standing here right now.

36:19.626 --> 36:23.247
Please. We're complying with your wishes.

36:27.083 --> 36:29.450
*Nothing* gets through that door.

36:29.591 --> 36:33.270
They move an inch, shoot `em.

36:52.870 --> 36:54.862
Hold on!

36:55.257 --> 36:58.409
You just couldn't wait for those human bodies, could you?

36:59.364 --> 37:02.446
The human body is frail, weak;

37:02.567 --> 37:04.817
every second that much closer to dying.

37:04.818 --> 37:08.391
Yeah, and this whole ascension thing, you're just giving up on that, huh?

37:08.871 --> 37:11.977
Not at all. I'm certain there's another way

37:12.276 --> 37:16.272
and with this body, I'll have plenty of time to discover it.

37:29.036 --> 37:29.833
Any luck?

37:29.834 --> 37:31.438
They've shut just about everything down.

37:31.439 --> 37:34.849
The power's cut to most of the critical systems.
Except for the D.H.D. and the Gate.

37:34.889 --> 37:36.553
They're obviously going to try to dial out.

37:36.646 --> 37:39.119
Now, I've managed to gain remote access to the mainframe.

37:39.120 --> 37:43.889
I'm creating a work-around to allow the resumption of naqahdah power to the central tower's primary systems.

37:43.971 --> 37:46.279
It's minimal, to be sure, but from there at least we'll be able to...

37:46.280 --> 37:49.174
over-ride the Replicator programme and restart the remaining systems.

37:49.175 --> 37:51.975
Exactly. Just hurry. We need power back, now.

37:52.514 --> 37:53.873
OK, is there anything you want me to do?

37:53.874 --> 37:56.990
Yes, well, for starters you could, um, stay out of my way.

37:57.518 --> 37:59.920
Oh, yes, sorry. All right.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.207
And be quiet.

38:08.977 --> 38:11.590
John, stay back. Let me handle this.

38:12.281 --> 38:14.192
Haven't you done enough already?

38:14.193 --> 38:15.774
I'm trying to help you.

38:15.775 --> 38:17.121
By what?

38:17.285 --> 38:18.270
Escaping?

38:18.271 --> 38:20.449
I didn't know that Koracen would do this.

38:20.450 --> 38:21.680
Of *course* she knew.

38:22.008 --> 38:26.496
Elizabeth has been a willing participant in our goals from the very beginning.

38:26.590 --> 38:29.203
It was her idea to come here in the first place.

38:30.785 --> 38:32.684
You said you broke off from them ?

38:32.860 --> 38:34.512
that they couldn't track you.

38:34.641 --> 38:35.965
Track her?

38:36.129 --> 38:39.949
She was the one who alerted us, when the time was right, to come.

38:40.266 --> 38:41.931
We were only following her commands.

38:41.989 --> 38:45.833
John, listen to me. I *had* to bring them here.

38:45.903 --> 38:48.165
It was our only chance;

38:48.270 --> 38:49.806
our only way out.

38:50.358 --> 38:53.850
I didn't know that Koracen would cause this kind of trouble.

38:54.335 --> 38:56.104
I didn't think that anyone would get hurt.

38:56.105 --> 38:57.862
What did you think we were gonna do:

38:58.050 --> 39:00.804
just give you a bunch of Replicator bodies and send you on your way?

39:00.805 --> 39:03.639
I truly believed that we were no threat to you.

39:03.804 --> 39:06.358
You may still think that you're Elizabeth,

39:06.639 --> 39:08.714
but you're not.

39:33.404 --> 39:37.166
If you'd like to resume your work, I've decided to allow it.

39:37.318 --> 39:39.428
We would re-engage the forcefield of course.

39:39.545 --> 39:41.291
Beef up security.

39:41.830 --> 39:43.365
It's too risky.

39:45.193 --> 39:48.158
I thought that bringing the others here would be safe.

39:48.557 --> 39:49.799
I was wrong.

39:50.232 --> 39:53.713
I can no longer guarantee there won't be any more trouble from them,

39:53.854 --> 39:55.260
or even myself.

39:56.807 --> 39:58.963
All right, um...

39:59.947 --> 40:01.729
what do you wanna do?

40:03.475 --> 40:07.072
I remember after you reactivated the nanites cells inside me,

40:07.154 --> 40:08.947
I said this was a bad idea.

40:09.041 --> 40:12.111
So much has gone wrong since then,

40:13.972 --> 40:17.887
but I think I know how I can finally set things right.

40:22.597 --> 40:23.969
Go ahead.

40:42.849 --> 40:45.556
If you need anything else for your work, let us know.

40:45.731 --> 40:47.067
Thanks, Rodney.

40:47.407 --> 40:51.591
Once again, you have to promise to stay put until you're finished constructing the human bodies.

40:51.837 --> 40:53.419
No leaving your homeworld;

40:53.489 --> 40:57.134
no communication with any other civilisation except Atlantis.

40:57.135 --> 40:58.563
You have my word.

40:58.774 --> 41:00.216
Good luck with your command, Richard.

41:00.321 --> 41:04.130
It's comforting to know Atlantis is in capable hands.

41:04.716 --> 41:05.899
Thank you.

41:06.380 --> 41:08.278
Shall we?

41:10.919 --> 41:12.431
It's OK.

41:12.571 --> 41:14.095
I'll go first.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.170
It's safe.

42:13.634 --> 42:16.786
You're sure the D.H.D. reconfiguration worked?

42:17.126 --> 42:18.310
Yes.

42:18.802 --> 42:20.864
They were sent to a space Gate.

42:22.183 --> 42:25.253
I guess that answers the question as to whether it was really Elizabeth.
