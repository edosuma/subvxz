WEBVTT

00:03.941 --> 00:06.012
'Twas the week
before Chrismukkah,

00:06.145 --> 00:07.414
all through the café,

00:07.481 --> 00:10.220
eight nights of candles
and a guy on a sleigh.

00:10.287 --> 00:13.460
The Jews eat a lot of food,
all fried up in oil.

00:13.528 --> 00:16.767
The goyim give presents,
wrapped up in tinfoil.

00:16.901 --> 00:18.504
SHEILA:
On vodka,

00:18.604 --> 00:20.007
on whiskey,

00:20.073 --> 00:21.744
on brandy and gin.

00:21.844 --> 00:23.514
If you're about
to start drinking,

00:23.614 --> 00:24.616
you know I'm all in.

00:24.683 --> 00:25.952
-Hey!
-Whoo!

00:26.052 --> 00:27.956
-Hello?
-Wow, looks like
a Hallmark movie

00:28.056 --> 00:28.824
threw up in here.

00:28.891 --> 00:30.595
(sighs) Well,
I love Chrismukkah.

00:30.695 --> 00:33.033
The music, the traditions,
the TV shows.

00:33.099 --> 00:35.705
My favorite is Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Tax Lawyer

00:35.772 --> 00:36.774
from Palm Beach.

00:36.840 --> 00:38.376
You were a weird six-year-old,

00:38.443 --> 00:41.149
and you're an even
weirder 41-year-old.

00:41.249 --> 00:43.053
What have you guys been up to?

00:43.186 --> 00:45.424
Oh, we're just hanging out
at The Middle C, talking about

00:45.490 --> 00:47.629
important stuff, like,
life, our girlfriends,

00:47.696 --> 00:50.935
who'd win in a fight, Batman
or Kevin from Home Alone.

00:51.069 --> 00:52.572
You sure you're okay
hanging out in a bar?

00:52.672 --> 00:54.610
It's only been a few weeks
since you stopped drinking.

00:54.676 --> 00:55.912
And it's obviously Kevin,

00:56.012 --> 00:57.983
he would do anything to get back
with his family.

00:58.083 --> 00:59.218
I was fine, Kat,

00:59.285 --> 01:01.089
just like when we were
in the wine section

01:01.155 --> 01:02.024
at the grocery store,

01:02.091 --> 01:04.095
or when that
tequila commercial came on,

01:04.161 --> 01:06.299
or when I stand too close
to your mother.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.036
Well, what you're doing

01:08.103 --> 01:09.005
is not easy.

01:09.171 --> 01:11.209
I remember how hard it was
for me to give up sugar.

01:11.309 --> 01:12.712
You just put whipped cream

01:12.779 --> 01:14.616
and two sugar packets
in that hot chocolate.

01:14.683 --> 01:17.789
I'm halfway through
a six-year taper, okay, Randi?

01:18.456 --> 01:20.561
Well, I'm great.
I woke up early,

01:20.628 --> 01:23.166
I worked on a song,
went to the rock climbing gym,

01:23.266 --> 01:24.836
met a guy named Barry
in the locker room

01:24.903 --> 01:27.842
who dries himself off from
head to toe with a blow dryer.

01:27.943 --> 01:29.947
Why do you hate towels, Barry?

01:30.047 --> 01:33.019
You're spending more time at
that gym than you are with me.

01:33.119 --> 01:35.123
I'm starting to think
you might be taking me

01:35.190 --> 01:36.459
for granite. (laughs)

01:36.527 --> 01:39.967
Ugh, you know, Max,
I have some friends

01:40.033 --> 01:42.104
with daughters
who'd be perfect for you.

01:42.171 --> 01:44.275
-Uh...
-Thank you for the offer,
Sheila,

01:44.342 --> 01:46.814
but I have to decline, again.

01:47.381 --> 01:50.053
You know, how would you feel
if I came climbing with you?

01:50.087 --> 01:52.391
Not a question.
I'm coming climbing with you.

01:52.525 --> 01:54.462
Hm... yeah, that would be great.

01:54.529 --> 01:56.332
You can meet blow dryer Barry.

01:56.432 --> 01:58.971
Unbelievable. Louisville Weekly
just kicked me out

01:59.038 --> 02:00.975
of the Twelve Pubs
of Christmas bar crawl.

02:01.042 --> 02:03.146
They said they wanted
new businesses.

02:03.279 --> 02:04.983
Mm, sounds racist to me.

02:05.050 --> 02:07.221
Damn it, I should've said that.

02:07.287 --> 02:08.423
They're gonna replace me

02:08.524 --> 02:10.160
with that stupid board game bar.

02:10.227 --> 02:12.866
Corks and Orcs?
I love that place.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.703
They do beer pong right.

02:14.803 --> 02:16.172
First, you have a beer,

02:16.272 --> 02:17.609
then you play Pong.

02:18.476 --> 02:20.682
That pub crawl is the biggest
money maker of the year for me.

02:20.815 --> 02:23.788
I mean, I bought a crazy
expensive beer tap system,

02:23.888 --> 02:25.023
maxed out my credit card,

02:25.123 --> 02:26.560
and this one's in my real name.

02:26.694 --> 02:28.964
Well, you know you can
make the money back

02:29.031 --> 02:30.902
by charging white people
double on MLK Day.

02:30.968 --> 02:32.104
They can't say no.

02:32.137 --> 02:33.841
-It's true, we really can't.
-Yeah.

02:35.110 --> 02:36.814
♪ Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me ♪

02:36.914 --> 02:39.218
♪ Nothin' wrong with you
but I'd rather be me. ♪

02:40.755 --> 02:42.826
Now, why would they pick
this place over The Middle C

02:42.926 --> 02:43.894
for the pub crawl?

02:43.961 --> 02:45.163
It's a bunch of toys and games.

02:45.230 --> 02:47.134
What does that have to do
with Christmas?

02:47.201 --> 02:48.971
I see Jenga,
I see pick-up sticks,

02:49.038 --> 02:50.808
I see vodka.
We are one match away

02:50.875 --> 02:54.716
from a bunch of chess nerds
roasting on an open fire.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.185
Damn, you a sexy badass.

02:56.252 --> 02:58.056
I never want
to break up with you,

02:58.156 --> 03:00.995
and even if I did,
I'd be too scared to.

03:01.062 --> 03:03.299
-Oh, hey, guys.
-Sup, Zac.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.669
Heard you got picked

03:04.770 --> 03:05.905
for the Twelve Pubs
of Christmas this year.

03:05.972 --> 03:08.076
Yeah, bad move.

03:08.176 --> 03:10.313
-What are you doing?
-I'm sending a message.

03:10.414 --> 03:12.752
I just wanted to warn you

03:12.819 --> 03:16.159
that the pub crawl
is a ton of work and no reward.

03:16.225 --> 03:18.129
Kind of like having kids.

03:18.196 --> 03:19.231
You got kids?

03:19.331 --> 03:20.501
I have a dog.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.804
You know how they poop
on the rug,

03:21.904 --> 03:23.206
and then you step in it?

03:23.339 --> 03:24.710
That's what the Twelve Pubs
of Christmas is like.

03:24.776 --> 03:27.047
Uh, I don't know,
the magazine said

03:27.114 --> 03:28.751
the pub crawl
makes a lot of money.

03:28.851 --> 03:32.024
But is business really
about making money, though?

03:32.091 --> 03:34.996
For me? No, I got in early
on Bitcoin.

03:35.063 --> 03:37.134
Really? Not married, no kids?

03:37.234 --> 03:40.875
(chuckling)
You know, I love dogs.

03:40.942 --> 03:42.010
What are you doing?

03:42.111 --> 03:43.781
I'm sending a different message.

03:43.848 --> 03:45.217
-(chuckles)
-Well,

03:45.283 --> 03:47.488
I came up with a... (chuckles)
pretty sick theme.

03:47.555 --> 03:49.993
Uh, I don't want
to toot my own horn,

03:50.093 --> 03:52.197
-but "toot, toot."
-(laughs)

03:52.231 --> 03:53.934
Toot, toot. (laughs)

03:54.001 --> 03:55.270
Yeah, I will be

03:55.337 --> 03:57.909
converting Corks and Orcs

03:57.976 --> 03:59.746
into an interactive

03:59.813 --> 04:03.521
science fiction
space Christmas adventure.

04:03.621 --> 04:04.589
Mm-hmm.

04:04.689 --> 04:05.792
Mm-hmm. See,

04:05.858 --> 04:07.394
you got a problem already.

04:07.494 --> 04:09.900
That's way too small for people.

04:11.068 --> 04:12.806
-This is a model.
-Oh. Oh, you know,

04:12.906 --> 04:15.845
some people said that
I should be a model.

04:15.912 --> 04:17.682
Oh, you want to see something

04:17.715 --> 04:19.385
extremely cool?

04:19.452 --> 04:21.557
-Check this out. (chuckles)
-(festive music playing)

04:21.657 --> 04:24.061
GEORGE TAKEI (over recording):
Space and holiday cheer.

04:24.161 --> 04:26.165
This is the voyage

04:26.232 --> 04:28.470
of the Twelve Pubs of Christmas.

04:28.537 --> 04:31.109
Insert cool space sound.

04:31.175 --> 04:32.411
Vroom.

04:32.512 --> 04:33.914
I'm George Takei,

04:34.014 --> 04:36.252
and welcome to Corks and Orcs.

04:36.319 --> 04:39.593
You know,
I've got a catchphrase.

04:39.726 --> 04:40.795
Should I say it?

04:40.895 --> 04:43.501
-Oh, my.
-(mouths words)

04:43.567 --> 04:45.571
(chuckles) I still have to edit
the final version,

04:45.671 --> 04:48.611
but, uh, yeah, Mr. Sulu himself

04:48.677 --> 04:49.679
is gonna be here

04:49.713 --> 04:52.117
playing Connect Four
with my customers.

04:52.184 --> 04:53.888
(laughs) I hear,
after a few drinks,

04:53.954 --> 04:55.825
he'll trash-talk Shatner.

04:55.892 --> 04:57.562
-(laughs)
-Oh, uh,

04:57.662 --> 04:58.429
excuse me.

04:58.496 --> 05:00.200
Oh, Zac, you are so hilarious.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.705
Let's laugh over dinner
sometime, your treat.

05:02.772 --> 05:03.841
(laughs)

05:03.941 --> 05:05.878
Damn, all I was gonna do
was throw some brandy

05:05.978 --> 05:08.784
in some expired milk and
tell everybody it was eggnog.

05:08.851 --> 05:11.790
Yeah, babe,
your idea sucks so bad.

05:11.857 --> 05:14.963
-Are you putting on--
Can we go, please?
-Go?

05:15.063 --> 05:16.934
You ain't got no Bitcoin.

05:19.205 --> 05:20.908
MAX:
Yeah, you're doing great.

05:20.975 --> 05:22.444
Now, reach for the blue one.

05:22.579 --> 05:23.714
Which is the blue one?

05:23.781 --> 05:25.751
The altitude
is blurring my vision.

05:25.818 --> 05:27.487
Just imagine
you're raising your hand

05:27.589 --> 05:29.491
to volunteer for extra homework.

05:29.593 --> 05:30.561
Oh.

05:30.628 --> 05:32.030
MAX:
You got it. That's it.
Now, one more.

05:32.097 --> 05:33.567
-Don't look down.
-KAT: Okay.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.003
I'm not looking down.

05:35.070 --> 05:36.339
(gasps) Oh, I looked down.

05:36.439 --> 05:38.577
It's okay, all I saw
was my boobs.

05:38.677 --> 05:42.552
That's good. They motivate me,
let them motivate you.

05:42.619 --> 05:44.589
(grunts)

05:44.689 --> 05:45.958
-(rings bell)
-(laughs)

05:46.092 --> 05:47.227
I can't believe it.

05:47.294 --> 05:50.601
I did it! Take that, gravity!

05:50.668 --> 05:53.206
(laughs)

05:53.273 --> 05:54.108
Excuse me,

05:54.208 --> 05:56.045
can Kiera have a turn
on the kids' wall?

05:56.078 --> 05:58.951
(mocking): Can Kiera have a turn
on the kids' wall?

06:06.399 --> 06:08.136
Okay, I know
I'm gonna regret asking,

06:08.236 --> 06:09.539
but what are you doing?

06:09.606 --> 06:12.545
I'm strengthening my hands
for rock climbing.

06:12.612 --> 06:15.651
It'll also come in handy
if I ever need to milk a goat.

06:15.718 --> 06:18.557
Strengthening your hands
will only accentuate

06:18.591 --> 06:19.391
the hair on them.

06:19.458 --> 06:22.297
Mother, it's not hair,
it's peach fuzz.

06:22.397 --> 06:25.437
Ooh, it's dark
and kind of thick peach fuzz.

06:26.272 --> 06:29.311
I'm doing this so I can become a
better climbing partner for Max.

06:29.378 --> 06:31.382
Maybe some day
we'll summit Kilimanjaro,

06:31.415 --> 06:33.253
but today at 4:00,
I'm gonna show the kiddie wall

06:33.319 --> 06:35.290
what an advanced beginner
looks like.

06:35.390 --> 06:37.829
I'm back in the
Twelve Pubs of Christmas.

06:37.895 --> 06:40.200
-Oh!
-Oh, babe, that's amazing.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.570
Wait, is Corks and Orcs out?

06:41.670 --> 06:44.308
Is Zac okay? Do he
and his Bitcoin need to be held?

06:44.408 --> 06:46.412
No, everyone is still in.

06:46.546 --> 06:48.216
Oh, so there's
13 Pubs of Christmas?

06:48.349 --> 06:50.788
They're still gonna call it
the Twelve Pubs of Christmas.

06:50.821 --> 06:53.393
Mm, but that would be inaccurate
because there's 13.

06:53.459 --> 06:55.363
Does no one care about numbers?

06:55.463 --> 06:58.671
I do. You have
ten hairy fingers.

06:59.471 --> 07:01.108
Well, how did you get them
to change their minds?

07:01.175 --> 07:02.477
Did you sleep with someone?

07:02.578 --> 07:05.116
I'll be mad,
but game recognize game.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.687
I went down
to Louisville Weekly,

07:06.753 --> 07:08.590
and I told them
I have a killer concept

07:08.657 --> 07:11.362
that's pure genius
and cannot be denied.

07:11.429 --> 07:14.335
Then they denied me,
so I said that's racist,

07:14.368 --> 07:16.940
and now I'm back in.

07:17.007 --> 07:19.546
Ooh, what's your concept?
Cats in Santa hats?

07:19.613 --> 07:21.683
Cats in antlers?
Cats in yarmulkes?

07:21.750 --> 07:24.221
I mean, those are all so good,
how would you pick?

07:24.321 --> 07:26.225
How about an ugly sweater party?

07:26.325 --> 07:27.461
The pub can crawl

07:27.595 --> 07:29.599
right through
Katharine's closet.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.770
I'm doing an ice bar.

07:31.837 --> 07:34.909
Everything in The Middle C,
from the furniture to the bar,

07:34.976 --> 07:36.178
will be made out of ice.

07:36.245 --> 07:39.051
And Darren said he's got a guy
who can get me a penguin.

07:39.118 --> 07:40.420
Ice?

07:40.521 --> 07:42.190
Yeah, that's gonna be too cold
for the cats.

07:42.290 --> 07:44.796
There will be no cats.

07:50.908 --> 07:51.943
All right, now,

07:52.044 --> 07:54.315
according to the
Boulder Bros on YouTube,

07:54.381 --> 07:56.085
it's very important
to warm up the hands

07:56.152 --> 07:59.425
before we climb the snot
out of this janky-ass pitch.

07:59.491 --> 08:02.030
It's a very bro-centric channel.

08:02.097 --> 08:03.734
My hands are warm.

08:03.801 --> 08:06.205
Barry made me blow-dry his back.

08:06.305 --> 08:08.343
My hands are wet,
my hands are dry.

08:08.409 --> 08:09.879
My hands are wet,
my hands are dry. Come on.

08:09.913 --> 08:12.384
-I'm squeezing your boobs.
I'm having fun.
-Oh...

08:12.518 --> 08:13.787
I'm squeezing your boobs.
I'm having fun.

08:13.887 --> 08:16.660
Hey, you know, we should have
a YouTube channel.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.262
We could call it, uh...

08:18.396 --> 08:20.133
"Kat to the Max." (laughs)

08:20.200 --> 08:22.505
Ooh, is this what
climber's high feels like?

08:22.605 --> 08:24.976
No, for that, we actually
have to climb, so...

08:25.076 --> 08:26.513
I'll go first.

08:26.580 --> 08:28.049
You stay here.

08:28.149 --> 08:30.621
Nice and quiet.

08:31.990 --> 08:33.527
Right. You got this.

08:33.627 --> 08:36.365
Okay, reach.
Yeah, stick that jug.

08:36.399 --> 08:37.668
You got a pretty spicy pinch
coming up.

08:37.802 --> 08:40.741
Maybe do a knee-bar,
give your hands a rest.

08:40.841 --> 08:41.610
Great tip.

08:41.710 --> 08:44.048
(grunts) Really helps me
clear my mind.

08:44.114 --> 08:45.450
Hey, before you get
to that undercling,

08:45.518 --> 08:46.787
you've got a little,
uh, undercling

08:46.853 --> 08:48.423
going on in your shorts.
(laughs)

08:48.524 --> 08:50.360
You are literally
driving me up this wall.

08:50.427 --> 08:51.395
KAT:
Okay, I'm sorry.

08:51.462 --> 08:52.899
It's just you and the rock.

08:52.999 --> 08:53.700
I'm not even here.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.871
Go to your happy place.

08:55.971 --> 08:57.675
Kat to the Max.

08:57.742 --> 09:00.413
Damn, I wish I had a beer
right now...

09:00.480 --> 09:02.417
so I could drop it on her.

09:02.518 --> 09:04.689
That's my boyfriend.

09:05.524 --> 09:07.729
We got a YouTube channel.

09:14.341 --> 09:17.247
Whew, it's colder
than my ex in here.

09:17.314 --> 09:18.617
Would you quit your whining.

09:18.684 --> 09:21.322
We're creating a magical
holiday wonderland.

09:21.422 --> 09:23.226
And Tasha wasn't cold,

09:23.292 --> 09:25.765
-she just had standards.
-(scoffs)

09:25.898 --> 09:27.568
Aw...

09:27.702 --> 09:29.171
Come on, man.

09:29.271 --> 09:30.841
What? It's ice, it's slippery.

09:30.908 --> 09:32.344
Plus, I just lotioned up.

09:32.411 --> 09:34.148
-Sweet Pea Vanilla, baby.
-Man...

09:34.214 --> 09:35.483
Just be more careful.

09:35.584 --> 09:37.688
Look, I got a lot
riding on this.

09:37.755 --> 09:40.661
Now, did you talk
to your penguin guy or not?

09:40.728 --> 09:41.730
Oh, it's all set up.

09:41.863 --> 09:45.771
We got tickets to the zoo,
duct tape, and a backpack.

09:48.911 --> 09:51.248
Does this look like a glass?

09:51.850 --> 09:54.321
Oh, honey, you're so handsome.

09:54.388 --> 09:56.125
Here, check mine out.

09:56.225 --> 09:58.429
Oh, my God, that is amazing.

09:58.496 --> 10:00.568
I hate you so much.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.404
Hey, I was thinking,
before climbing tomorrow,

10:02.471 --> 10:03.607
maybe we could stop
by McDonald's,

10:03.740 --> 10:05.544
climb the PlayPlace wall
as a warmup.

10:05.611 --> 10:08.116
Show those losers
in the ball pit how it's done.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.253
Uh, I can't tomorrow.
I have a song to work on.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.823
And the manager was pretty clear

10:11.890 --> 10:14.328
about us never coming back
to that McDonald's.

10:15.330 --> 10:16.766
Hey, everybody...

10:16.867 --> 10:17.802
Shut the damn door!

10:17.869 --> 10:19.471
Shut your damn mouth.

10:19.539 --> 10:21.776
The pub crawl is tomorrow,
and it's

10:21.877 --> 10:24.348
costing me $200 an hour
to run these stupid freezers.

10:24.448 --> 10:27.354
It's so cold in here,
I might have to put on a hat.

10:27.420 --> 10:28.724
A hat, Randi.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.928
Come on, babe,
it's gonna be great.

10:31.061 --> 10:34.268
I don't need it to be great,
I need it to be perfect.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.105
Corks and Orcs has George Takei.

10:36.205 --> 10:38.877
I got... Darren.

10:40.346 --> 10:41.917
Thank you.

10:43.119 --> 10:45.123
Carter, are you, uh,

10:45.156 --> 10:47.427
interested in someone
from Star Trek?

10:47.494 --> 10:48.496
I've got an in.

10:48.597 --> 10:50.668
-Really?
-Wait a minute,

10:50.768 --> 10:51.970
is it a cat?

10:52.037 --> 10:53.472
Maybe.

10:53.540 --> 10:55.878
Is it William Cat-ner?

10:55.945 --> 10:58.115
Yes.

10:59.552 --> 11:01.656
(knock on door)

11:03.492 --> 11:05.163
All right, I'm down.

11:05.263 --> 11:06.733
You're not Max.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.604
And you're not
my Kung Pao chicken.

11:08.670 --> 11:10.641
Oh, cute little gingerbread men.

11:10.741 --> 11:12.578
Ooh, not just men. Women, too.

11:12.645 --> 11:14.616
Down with the
gingerbread patriarchy.

11:14.682 --> 11:16.686
-What's going on with that one?
-Oh,

11:16.786 --> 11:20.426
he's non-binary.
Uh, I mean, they are. Damn it.

11:20.493 --> 11:22.732
-Anyway, Max isn't here.
-What?

11:22.832 --> 11:24.602
We were just texting,
like, 20 minutes ago.

11:24.669 --> 11:26.138
I asked how the song is going,

11:26.205 --> 11:28.042
and he said, "Not great.
I need a few more hours."

11:28.109 --> 11:29.913
So, I asked if he wanted me
to bring him some food,

11:29.979 --> 11:32.250
but stupid autocorrect
changed it to "good."

11:32.317 --> 11:33.520
So, then I sent, "No, good.

11:33.587 --> 11:36.726
Good. Good. Duck." Here I am.

11:36.793 --> 11:39.699
Okay, that was a ducking
journey to nowhere.

11:39.766 --> 11:43.239
He's really not here?
That's so weird.

11:43.306 --> 11:45.043
Wait, Find My Friends?

11:45.109 --> 11:47.715
Max agreed to let you
track his phone?

11:47.748 --> 11:49.519
Uh, I assume so.

11:49.586 --> 11:51.021
He let me watch him
put in his password

11:51.121 --> 11:53.894
over his shoulder, and then
he went and took a shower.

11:53.961 --> 11:56.098
Aw, you really do love him.

11:56.165 --> 11:59.639
Just the drinking thing
kind of freaked me out.

11:59.706 --> 12:00.574
Oh, no.

12:00.674 --> 12:01.710
What, is he at a bar?

12:01.776 --> 12:04.348
Worse, the rock climbing gym.

12:04.414 --> 12:05.651
Oh, hell yeah.

12:05.718 --> 12:08.055
-What?
-My Kung Pao chicken.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.105
Well...

12:16.171 --> 12:18.276
well...

12:18.342 --> 12:21.148
Give me a sec. (panting)

12:21.215 --> 12:22.852
Well...

12:29.364 --> 12:31.636
How did you know I was here?
I didn't tell anyone.

12:31.703 --> 12:34.642
I followed the pungent scent
of your deceit.

12:34.676 --> 12:37.314
Wait, have you been
tracking my phone?

12:37.380 --> 12:40.521
One major relationship breach
of trust at a time.

12:40.554 --> 12:41.690
What are you doing here
without me?

12:41.756 --> 12:43.627
This is the one thing
keeping me sane,

12:43.694 --> 12:45.330
and you're driving me
freaking crazy.

12:45.430 --> 12:47.500
Hey, you're not getting away
form me that easily.

12:47.568 --> 12:50.774
I have mastered the toe-smear
into a reverse bicycle.

12:50.841 --> 12:52.945
(grunts) See? That right there.
Don't do that.

12:53.045 --> 12:55.584
You're just putting random words
together you heard on YouTube.

12:55.651 --> 12:59.491
Watch, everyone, I'm doing
a Cincinnati Moon Pie squeeze.

12:59.592 --> 13:02.898
Hey, you know, I took up
rock climbing to support you.

13:02.932 --> 13:05.069
Maybe if Gisele had shown
more of an interest in football,

13:05.169 --> 13:06.506
she and Tom
would still be married.

13:06.606 --> 13:08.175
Well, maybe Gisele did take
an interest in football,

13:08.275 --> 13:09.846
then watched a bunch
of stupid YouTube videos

13:09.912 --> 13:11.916
and acted like she knew
more about it than he did,

13:12.017 --> 13:13.285
and then she tracked his phone.

13:13.352 --> 13:15.189
Oh, maybe Gisele
had to track Tom's phone

13:15.256 --> 13:16.826
because she isn't sure
he has a handle

13:16.926 --> 13:18.697
on his somewhat complicated
relationship with alcohol.

13:18.797 --> 13:21.836
Well, guess what,
being here by myself

13:21.936 --> 13:23.205
really helps me with that.

13:23.306 --> 13:25.143
And you know
what doesn't help me?

13:25.243 --> 13:27.414
Kat to the Max!

13:28.082 --> 13:29.384
Don't you climb away from me.

13:29.451 --> 13:31.021
Oh, oh. Ah.

13:31.088 --> 13:33.326
-Oh, no. Oh, oh.
-What're you doing?

13:33.392 --> 13:35.731
I don't know, I think
I've made that pretty clear.

13:35.831 --> 13:37.334
(screams)

13:37.400 --> 13:38.537
(thud)

13:38.670 --> 13:41.041
KAT:
What the hell are the ropes for?

13:42.978 --> 13:45.149
Damn it,
it's 31 degrees in here.

13:45.216 --> 13:47.354
We real close to melting.
Darren,

13:47.420 --> 13:48.623
are you breathing again?

13:48.724 --> 13:49.826
Yeah, but I got to...

13:49.892 --> 13:53.065
I told you, slow and shallow,
like the girls you date.

13:55.069 --> 13:56.506
Whoa, you saw that, too, right?

13:56.606 --> 13:58.944
Or am I just lightheaded from
not being allowed to breathe?

13:59.044 --> 14:02.083
It's the freezers.
They're pulling too much power.

14:03.352 --> 14:05.958
Oh, this is all
your fault, Ice Carter.

14:06.025 --> 14:08.095
I don't know why
you had such a stupid idea.

14:09.297 --> 14:12.905
Look at that smile.
I can't stay mad at you.

14:16.646 --> 14:19.117
-Oh, good, you're still here.
-Hey, I was just heading over.

14:19.217 --> 14:20.587
-You like my new coat?
-Uh, it's fine.

14:20.687 --> 14:22.658
-Now, let me in the café.
-Well, Kat said it was neat,

14:22.758 --> 14:23.894
so now I think I hate it.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.597
I don't care,
just unlock the door.

14:25.664 --> 14:26.766
What the hell is with you?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.436
You've been snapping at me
all week.

14:28.570 --> 14:30.006
Because I am $10,000 in debt,

14:30.106 --> 14:32.243
and Ice Carter is about to have
slush for brains.

14:32.310 --> 14:33.647
Now, would you please
open the door,

14:33.747 --> 14:35.083
so I can steal some power.

14:35.183 --> 14:36.519
You can't plug into the café.

14:36.619 --> 14:39.424
The wiring's so old, it's
segregated by color. (laughs)

14:39.491 --> 14:41.696
Would you stop being sassy
and help me.

14:41.763 --> 14:43.199
Don't talk to me like that.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.702
And I can't help being sassy.

14:44.769 --> 14:47.173
I'm third-generation bad bitch.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.246
Calling me sassy.
You lost your damn mind.

14:54.020 --> 14:56.659
I don't know if you
really hear prayers,

14:56.793 --> 15:00.399
but if you do,
please help me, Santa.

15:07.581 --> 15:10.521
(lisping): I'm sorry
I pulled you off the wall.

15:10.587 --> 15:12.825
Don't worry about it.

15:12.892 --> 15:15.129
Your face broke my fall.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.837
You feeling okay?

15:18.904 --> 15:19.772
A little sore.

15:19.839 --> 15:22.310
Will you let me know
if I start drooling?

15:22.410 --> 15:24.347
(chuckles) Yes.

15:24.414 --> 15:26.820
Five minutes ago,
you started drooling.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.690
Oh...

15:28.790 --> 15:30.326
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

15:30.393 --> 15:32.832
I should've just told you
that I needed some space.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.369
Space? From me?

15:35.403 --> 15:37.407
Inconceivable.

15:38.510 --> 15:41.148
I'm sorry I snooped on you.

15:41.248 --> 15:42.217
I just...

15:42.317 --> 15:43.987
I'm worried about you drinking.

15:44.054 --> 15:46.191
I haven't had a drink
in three weeks.

15:46.258 --> 15:49.164
I know, and that's great.

15:49.264 --> 15:50.500
And I...

15:50.567 --> 15:54.174
guarantee you that I worry
about myself twice as much.

15:56.613 --> 15:58.717
I don't know if I have
a drinking problem,

15:58.783 --> 16:00.486
but I know my dad did.

16:00.587 --> 16:02.625
What?

16:02.691 --> 16:04.929
You don't notice it as a kid,

16:04.996 --> 16:06.398
but looking back,

16:06.431 --> 16:08.937
I mean, he was drunk
all the time.

16:09.037 --> 16:11.008
Oh... Max.

16:11.108 --> 16:13.613
I don't know if he left
or my mom kicked him out

16:13.680 --> 16:15.551
or... (inhales sharply)

16:15.651 --> 16:19.692
(exhales) Either way,
it wrecked my family.

16:20.694 --> 16:22.330
That's awful.

16:22.397 --> 16:25.203
I just don't want
to turn out like him.

16:27.741 --> 16:29.879
You are not your dad.

16:29.946 --> 16:31.516
Yeah, I hope not.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.620
You're not.

16:36.058 --> 16:38.530
Thank you.

16:38.630 --> 16:41.736
I'm glad you told me.

16:42.538 --> 16:44.040
Me, too.

16:45.511 --> 16:47.247
But I am changing
my phone password

16:47.313 --> 16:49.552
and finding a climbing gym that
you don't know anything about.

16:49.585 --> 16:52.457
Reasonable. I overstepped.

16:52.525 --> 16:53.960
I'm sorry.

16:54.027 --> 16:55.597
Kiss?

16:55.664 --> 16:56.799
Oh, I'm still drooling?

16:56.900 --> 16:59.170
-Yeah, you never stopped.
-Oh...

16:59.237 --> 17:01.108
-Come here.
-Oh.

17:05.784 --> 17:08.155
(overlapping chatter)

17:09.024 --> 17:12.898
It is like
a winter wonderland in here.

17:12.965 --> 17:14.936
It's best to just nod and smile.

17:15.036 --> 17:17.240
I've been doing that
her whole life.

17:18.944 --> 17:20.179
Whoo!

17:20.313 --> 17:23.520
Oh, wow. That looks fun.

17:23.587 --> 17:26.659
And only $15!

17:26.726 --> 17:29.130
-What is that?
-An ice luge.

17:29.197 --> 17:30.466
You do shots out of it.

17:30.567 --> 17:33.205
Good God, didn't you learn
anything in high school?

17:33.305 --> 17:36.478
I was valedictorian.
I learned everything.

17:36.512 --> 17:39.084
Darren, set me up.

17:39.150 --> 17:41.154
I was a gold medalist

17:41.221 --> 17:43.827
in ice luge at Margaritaville.

17:48.202 --> 17:51.275
(laughs) Oh, my God.
George Takei.

17:51.341 --> 17:52.811
What're you doing here?

17:52.878 --> 17:54.949
Well, I'd stomached
as much nerd talk

17:55.016 --> 17:57.855
as I could at Corks and Dorks.

17:57.922 --> 17:59.190
(laughs)

17:59.324 --> 18:00.560

George?

18:17.928 --> 18:20.701
I almost didn't recognize you
with your pants on.

18:20.801 --> 18:23.339
Uh... you two know each other?

18:23.439 --> 18:27.548
Oh, we met at Leonard Nimoy's
bicentennial fondue party.

18:27.615 --> 18:28.783
Oh.

18:28.850 --> 18:31.723
So, uh, you've seen his phaser?

18:31.823 --> 18:34.862
Yes, and it was set to stun.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.570
Mr. Takei, I, uh-- huge fan.

18:38.637 --> 18:41.609
Oh, my.

18:41.676 --> 18:43.880
Merry Christmas to me.

18:43.980 --> 18:44.949
(laughs)

18:45.016 --> 18:46.786
I see you still
talk to yourself.

18:46.853 --> 18:49.424
I talk to whomever I want to.

18:49.491 --> 18:52.798
I'm George (bleep) Takei.

I'm really sorry about earlier.

19:22.925 --> 19:24.695
Just been so stressed
about money.

Why do you need
a fancy beer tap anyway?

19:27.066 --> 19:30.306
Zac and I were texting,
and he said they're overrated.

19:31.008 --> 19:32.778
Actually...

19:32.845 --> 19:34.782
I bought something else.

Dating or when we first met?

20:02.705 --> 20:03.840
What's the difference?

20:03.907 --> 20:05.476
I mean, I'm on my knee,
and it's freezing out here.

20:05.544 --> 20:07.581
Well, I didn't tell you to do it
outside in December.

we were at Ruth's Chris.
