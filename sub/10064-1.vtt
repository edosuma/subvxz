Billy, I'm telling Mommy you're being bad!

- Zap! Got ya!
- Stop it, Billy! Stop it!

01:10.070 --> 01:12.154

What's the matter, Billy?
[Loud Crashing]

01:17.994 --> 01:21.371
- What's going on here, Billy?
- I told you, hush up!

01:28.922 --> 01:31.924
Hey, Billy, this is all wet here.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.804
Smells like kerosene.

That fire siren.

[Moans]

03:15.653 --> 03:19.907
Uh, didn't the doctor say
something about moderation?

03:19.991 --> 03:22.034
What does he know?

03:22.118 --> 03:24.036
He knows...

[Transylvanian Accent]
What a shameless, lustful woman
you are, my dear.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.375
And he doesn't want us
to hurt the baby.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.837
Oh. Well, we're gonna
have to be careful.

03:35.632 --> 03:39.509
Anyhow, I have a feeling that
if anything happened to this baby...

03:39.594 --> 03:41.511
you wouldn't marry me.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.513
I wouldn't
take a chance like that.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.557
Oh, now
that's a hell of a thing to say.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.935
I'm marrying you,
not the baby.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.148
Would you believe
I don't want you to go?

I've gotta answer the phone.

[Ringing Continues]
[Siren Continues Blaring]

04:05.078 --> 04:06.662

04:06.746 --> 04:09.164
[Laughing]
Okay. I'll make you a deal.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.791
Hmm.

04:10.917 --> 04:14.586
I won't answer the phone
if you don't go to the fire.
Deal.

[Ringing Continues]

04:16.673 --> 04:18.673

[Siren Continues Blaring]

04:25.598 --> 04:27.057
God, that's awful.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.811
Sure, I can come down
immediately.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.562
Yes, Doctor.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.404
- What's that all about?
- The fire, it's at the dairy farm.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.907
- Mitchell's?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, those poor kids.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.034
They're both burned pretty bad.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.037
They're going to bring them
into Dr. Brookmyre's office...

04:49.122 --> 04:52.582
until we can get an ambulance in
from Unity.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.258
Evans City Fire Hall.
Where's it at?
I didn't hear the code.

05:01.342 --> 05:04.261
That's the old dairy farm.
Must be pretty bad.

05:04.345 --> 05:06.763
I could see the flames
clear over at my place.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.308
Hey, Clanker!
See the soldiers?

05:09.392 --> 05:11.393
- Soldiers?
- Couple truckloads of 'em.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.353
Hmm. Poor schmucks.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.355
Wonder what
they're doing here.

Is Dan here yet?
[Man #2] Didn't see him.

05:19.610 --> 05:22.904
What's everybody
looking so happy about?
Give me a smoke.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.533
- Don't it bother you,
draggin' out like this?
- Somethin' to do.

Good morning there, Judy.

05:52.769 --> 05:57.064
The Evans City Volunteer
Fire Department apologizes for
dragging you out of bed this way.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.733
- You got a bad mouth, Clank.
- Yeah? You're late.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.235
I was the first one here.
[Judy]
David, be careful, please.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.155
I will.
Don't worry about him.

06:05.239 --> 06:08.992
I won't let him do anything dumb,
even though I still think
you picked the wrong guy.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.703
You're a slob, Clanker.
Ain't no girl gonna pick you.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.747
I'm gonna break your head.

06:14.832 --> 06:17.542
- Aw, ain't that cute?
- Shut up and drive.

[Judy]
Where's Dr. Brookmyre?
Are you the nurse?

06:31.391 --> 06:33.392
Who are you?
Where's Dr. Brookmyre?

06:33.476 --> 06:36.770
- In the office with Major Ryder.
- Major Ryder?

06:36.854 --> 06:39.064
- How many syringes do you have?
- Look, what's going on here?

06:39.148 --> 06:41.316
Major Ryder will explain.
We haven't got time.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.486
Break out those syringes.
We're gonna need a lot of them.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.947
The girl just died.
I think I can save the boy.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.783
Move, Nurse!

06:58.960 --> 07:02.504
- You've known about this for days.
- We never thought it would happen.

07:02.588 --> 07:06.383
- But you notified me!
You must have suspected!
- Notifying you was precautionary.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.553
We never thought it was possible.
We've got to call
the hospital in Unity!

07:09.637 --> 07:11.638
We need an ambulance
for those kids!

07:11.764 --> 07:16.184
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
We're bringing in our own medical personnel
with emergency equipment.

07:16.269 --> 07:20.188
- But this isn't the sort of thing-
- Look, we've quarantined the area.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.190
We're sealing off the town.

07:22.275 --> 07:26.069
- Have you got Colonel Peckem yet?
- [Soldier] Yeah.

07:28.197 --> 07:30.740
Uh, get Dr. Brookmyre a gas mask.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.242
Yes, sir.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.124
Yes, sir, they're certain.
They have three cases reported.

07:39.208 --> 07:42.127
They're waiting
for verifying blood tests.

07:42.211 --> 07:45.464
We'll need somebody from Trixie on the spot.
Is that being taken care of?

07:45.548 --> 07:49.885
I'm leaving for the airstrip now.
I should be in Evans City within two hours.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.846
Who knows about this?
Press blackout?

07:52.972 --> 07:57.642
Yes, sir, we'll button it up.
I'll be available by radio on the plane,
and I'll report in from Evans City.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.269
All right, sir.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.732
Give me Major Ryder on 2C, please.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.947
Major Ryder, have you set up
a perimeter around the town?

08:11.073 --> 08:14.493
Do the best you can.
Three more companies are on their way.
They may get in there before I do.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.204
In the meantime,
try to set up some kind of a perimeter.

08:17.288 --> 08:20.207
Nobody gets in or out of that town.
Now, is that clear?

08:20.291 --> 08:22.751
This is a blackout situation,

08:22.835 --> 08:26.505
so from here on in we're using
voiceprint checks for all communications.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.716
You don't talk to me or anybody else
unless you got a voiceprint check.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.801
That's the order of the day.

08:38.976 --> 08:42.562
Go on, fellas, bring the hose here.
We need a lot of slack.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.397
[Firemen Chattering]

08:44.482 --> 08:46.483
[Fireman]
You may want an air mask.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.612
Easy. Easy!

08:50.696 --> 08:53.240
[Firemen Shouting]

09:04.544 --> 09:08.421
Sheriff, what the hell's going on?
What do you think, you lunkhead?
There's a house burning.

09:08.548 --> 09:14.302
- No, no, what's this about the soldiers?
- Okay, let's move it. Clear the area
around the house and let it burn out.

09:14.428 --> 09:17.764
We could still save a good part of it.
Just get the lead out of your ass
and do something to help.

09:17.848 --> 09:21.434
I want them trees down over the garage.
I don't want them trees goin' up.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.479
There's a chain saw over by the wagon.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.439
What the hell?

09:26.566 --> 09:29.985
- [Man Shouting]
Get that fireman by that window there!
- He just went crazy.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.237
[Shouting Continues]
He set that fire himself.

09:32.321 --> 09:33.989
His wife's dead.
He killed her.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.448
Hey! Hey! Hey!

09:35.533 --> 09:38.618
When Mac and I first came here,
he was laughing like a hyena.

09:38.703 --> 09:43.081
Then all of a sudden, like as if
he had realized what he had done,

09:43.165 --> 09:45.083
he started to cry like a baby.

09:45.167 --> 09:49.254
Look out the car in there!
It's gonna blow up! Come on, man!

09:49.338 --> 09:53.633
Attaboy! Go in through that window!
Come on, through the window!

09:53.718 --> 09:56.761
Oh, my trees! My trees!

09:56.846 --> 09:58.680
They're all gonna go!

10:01.684 --> 10:03.393
[Man On Radio]
Uh, that is correct.

10:03.477 --> 10:06.354
With the ultraviolet light operative,
there is no need for your masks.

10:06.480 --> 10:11.109
We want all medical personnel
to wear their masks at all times, however,
and any civilian volunteers.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.987
You will need masks
outside the protected area,
Looks good. Looks good.

10:14.071 --> 10:17.616
But in the ultraviolet,
we're considering it safe without a mask.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.285
How much serum do we have?
Not very much,
I'm afraid.

10:20.369 --> 10:22.829
Boy, you people
sure come prepared, don't you?

10:22.913 --> 10:26.833
Everything's on its way, Doctor.
I mean, I can't snap my fingers
and make it appear!

10:26.917 --> 10:30.170
In a couple of hours
we'll have everything we need.

10:30.254 --> 10:33.548
It's not a cure.
Just a strong antibiotic
to build up resistance.

10:33.633 --> 10:37.177
Sir, Company "A" has arrived
with the rest of the radio gear.
Where do you want it installed?

10:37.303 --> 10:40.472
Set it up here.
This'll be temporary headquarters.
Sir, need a deployment for Company "B."

10:40.556 --> 10:42.515
Where do you want this box?
Put it over there.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.643
- Grab this one.
- I'll do it.

10:44.769 --> 10:48.563
[Soldier]
Somebody give me a hand, will ya!
What the heck they gonna do with all this?

10:48.689 --> 10:51.191
What's happening?
Listen to me and don't talk.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.234
There's a quarantine
on the town.

10:53.319 --> 10:56.237
Everything's going to be all right.
I just don't want
you and the baby exposed.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.239
Exposed to what?

10:58.324 --> 11:01.826
Just listen and don't say anything.
It's a highly contagious virus.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.913
We're expecting
several cases of it by morning.
I just don't want you around here.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.874
You're gonna need me.
I need you
like a hole in the head.

11:07.958 --> 11:11.795
- We've got a whole
army medical unit on the way.
- What's the army do-

11:11.921 --> 11:15.757
Will you listen to me?
They're not going to want me to let you go,
so you're going to have to sneak out.

11:15.883 --> 11:20.220
[Man] Okay, try this one!
I want you to take a syringe
and some antibiotic for David.

11:20.304 --> 11:24.391
You have to stay in town,
so find David and the two of you
stay away from people.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.685
[Man]
Get this one over here!

11:26.769 --> 11:31.398
Dr. Brookmyre, I think we should
discuss larger facilities.

11:31.482 --> 11:34.234
If this thing gets any worse,
we're gonna need someplace
to set up an infirmary.

11:34.318 --> 11:36.945
Nurse, I'd like you to work
with my doctor there.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.948
The men that haven't been
inoculated are gonna need
their shots when they report in.

11:40.032 --> 11:43.326
Nurse, we need more needles!
These men with the ultraviolet need shots!

11:43.452 --> 11:46.705
Follow doctor's orders.
[Man]
What's all this stuff for?

11:46.789 --> 11:50.291
- So we can get in and out of here.
- [Chattering Continues]

11:52.628 --> 11:55.922
[Man]
Over here. Over here!
All right. Got it.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.590
Burn a little?

11:57.675 --> 11:59.217
Yes, ma'am.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.969
You're okay.
Thank you, ma'am.

12:01.053 --> 12:04.472

Get out of the way!
I've got things to do!

12:04.557 --> 12:08.143
[Chattering Continues]

12:08.227 --> 12:11.730
- Come on, move your legs!
- All right, all right.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.357
Spend all day and night
around here.

12:15.484 --> 12:18.027
Start moving your ass
and unpack this stuff.
This is headquarters now.

12:18.112 --> 12:22.782
Major Ryder, you said you wanted
to discuss larger facilities.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.952
Maybe we could set something up
at the high school.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.086
How do you intend to
let the people know about all this?

12:35.171 --> 12:38.089
How? Well, we've been
promised bullhorns
and loudspeakers.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.216
No telling when
they're gonna arrive!

- Sheriff, they're setting up roadblocks.

13:32.144 --> 13:35.563
- What?
- Out on the interstate ramps.
They got one up over on I-80 too.

13:35.689 --> 13:39.776
What the hell gives here?
I don't know. They're making
an announcement at church services tonight.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.737
All hell's broke loose in town.
Nobody knows what's going on.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.031
We're up to our asses in soldiers.
What are you talking about?

13:45.157 --> 13:47.075
Where is that major?
At the doctor's office.

13:47.159 --> 13:50.078
They're setting up their gear there.
They'll be headquartering over there.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.081
- Brookmyre's office?
- Yeah. They're giving the soldiers
some kind of injection.

13:53.165 --> 13:56.084
- They say there's not enough for the town.
- Injections? What the hell is this about?

13:56.168 --> 13:59.295
I don't know. Stoney said he'd seen
a truckful of 'em going through town.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.714
Truckful, hell.
Must be a couple hundred.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.843
- Couple of hundred?
- Just get your butts back after that fire.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.053
What the hell's going on, Sheriff?

14:07.137 --> 14:09.389
You'll know when I do, boy.
Let's go.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.856
[Siren Blaring]

14:18.983 --> 14:20.942
What do you think, old buddy?
Judy's at Brookmyre's.

14:21.026 --> 14:24.946
I got the wheels if you want to
bust in and find out what's up.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.573
Let's go.

14:29.994 --> 14:34.706
[Church Bell Clanging]

14:34.790 --> 14:37.292
Saturday night service
is a high mass.

14:37.376 --> 14:40.336
Yes, Father.
We'll try not to disturb it
any more than necessary.

14:40.421 --> 14:43.923
- Perhaps after the mass
I could ask the people to wait.
- No, Father, I have to insist.

14:44.008 --> 14:48.553
We need to inform the people.
I've got to make this announcement.

14:48.637 --> 14:52.390
Excuse me, Father,
but we have the authority to do this
with or without your approval.

14:52.516 --> 14:55.727
You're aware of
the plane crash last week.
Yes.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.104
That plane contained
an experimental vaccine.

14:58.188 --> 15:02.108
We are afraid that crash
may have caused the spread
of an infectious virus...

15:02.192 --> 15:04.736
through this area.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.739
We can't give a story to the press yet.
We've got to see what develops.

15:07.823 --> 15:10.742
We need some medium
for reaching the people in that town.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.286
It's bad enough we didn't have
adequate supplies ready.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.413
It'll all be under control
within a few more hours.

15:15.497 --> 15:17.373
A few more hours?
That can be disastrous.

15:17.499 --> 15:22.921
You put martial law on a town,
drive a sneak perimeter around 'em like that,
and you’re just polarizing the situation.

15:23.005 --> 15:27.175
That army becomes
an invasionary force.
Those people are gonna resist.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.677
We're all concerned
with Evans City, Mr. Hawks,

15:29.762 --> 15:33.514
but our primary consideration
at this point is national security.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.726
- [Teletype Buzzing]
- All the citizens are being rounded up.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.895
We've got to get them together
in a central area.

15:38.979 --> 15:44.150
That'll solve the communications problem
and check any possible spread of the virus.

15:44.234 --> 15:47.904
Telephone and telegraph are cut off
except inside the Evans City limits.

15:47.988 --> 15:50.990
They've jammed the air to prevent
any ham stuff from going out.

15:51.116 --> 15:55.828
You've got to get the president on the phone.
We've got to get a nuclear weapon
in the air above that town.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.957
- Isn't that a little drastic?
- None of us wants to resort to that.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.334
But we've got to be ready.

16:01.418 --> 16:04.921
If Trixie jumps that perimeter, this thing
could spread over the entire continent.

16:05.005 --> 16:07.882
All right.
Get me the president.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.886
We'll recommend that he-
[Sighs]

16:11.971 --> 16:14.389
Instruct SAC to send a plane...

16:14.473 --> 16:17.392
on a training mission over Evans City.

16:19.478 --> 16:23.439
Find out what size weapon
it should carry to...

16:23.524 --> 16:25.483
burn out the infected area.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.527
[Men Chattering]

16:35.703 --> 16:39.038
- Any report from Trixie?
- They haven't rounded up
the entire team yet, sir.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.708
But several of the ones they reached
are already airborne.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.835
They're on their way
to Fort Dietrich.

16:43.961 --> 16:47.797
- We need somebody from that team
in Evans City, damn it!
- Well, Trixie was going to recommend a man.

16:47.881 --> 16:51.217
Oh, the hell with that!
Get the first Trixie man that arrives!

16:51.301 --> 16:53.928
- It's a mistake.
- Have a plane at Dietrich
and get him on it!

16:54.013 --> 16:56.723
- One of the biggest
goddamn boners of all time!
- The first man. You understand?

16:56.807 --> 16:58.558
- Dietrich?
- Don't even bother to check him in.

16:58.642 --> 17:01.644
We're not to even check you in, sir,
just get you on that plane.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.646
What's going on?
Look, I'm a key man on the Trixie team.

17:04.732 --> 17:08.443
A key man! I'm one of the developers
of the goddamn thing!

17:08.527 --> 17:12.030
I gotta have access to a lab.
Gotta have access to my computers.

17:12.114 --> 17:16.242
- Our orders are to get the first man
on the team in the field, sir.
- Jesus Christ, this is so random!

17:16.326 --> 17:18.911
A lousy technician
is what you need out there!

17:18.996 --> 17:23.249
Fly me out to Evans City
and you're tying my hands!
Don't you see that?

17:23.375 --> 17:27.295
I don't have access to that equipment,
I'm useless!
You'll have to clear this with command.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.965
- Don't you realize the consequences?
Soldier, stop the car.
- I'm sorry, sir. Those are the orders.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.967
Orders, my ass!
Stop the car!

17:33.052 --> 17:36.095
You're gonna have a hell of a time
getting me on that plane, soldier.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.931
Maybe so, sir, but we'll do it.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.487
It's the last we have.
Aw, come on!

17:52.571 --> 17:55.573
Can I have a hand over here?

17:57.993 --> 17:59.827
[Screaming]

18:04.500 --> 18:09.045
Goddamn voiceprint check
is a waste of valuable time.
We gotta make snap decisions.

18:09.129 --> 18:11.714
If I can't get through to you
without a five-minute delay-

18:11.799 --> 18:14.759
I gotta authorize all these decisions on my
own. I don't like the position it puts me in.

18:14.843 --> 18:18.596
I know, I know. I know Peckem will be here,
but until then I'm in charge.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.640
I don't like being a brass asshole.

18:20.724 --> 18:23.309
I'm not an infantry man.
I'm Chem Corp. Remember that? Huh?

18:23.393 --> 18:25.853
You don't know
what it's like out there.

18:25.979 --> 18:31.526
How can I hold the perimeter
and fight a small-scale war at the same time?
I need those additional men!

18:31.610 --> 18:35.738
Many of the people
in the outlying area are farmers,
and they've got weapons.

18:35.823 --> 18:37.990
You expect us
to lock up our end, huh?

18:38.075 --> 18:40.493
Well, what about your end, damn it?

18:40.577 --> 18:43.412
All right.
I'll see what we can do.

18:43.497 --> 18:47.708
They're meeting with more resistance,
and they've run into
a few more cases of infection.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.710
Major Ryder's requesting more men.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.921
I'll wait for
Colonel Peckem's evaluation.

18:52.005 --> 18:56.175
- Sir, if-
- Peckem'll be in there by 2:00.
They can hold out till then.

18:56.260 --> 19:00.012
- We have a man in there
telling us that maybe they can't.
- Oh, come on, Frank!

19:00.097 --> 19:03.307
This is highly organized,
riot-trained army.

19:03.392 --> 19:06.352
You can't tell me that they're
unable to hold the perimeter...

19:06.436 --> 19:09.939
on a small town
through early morning.

19:10.023 --> 19:13.025
## [Rock]

19:16.029 --> 19:18.447
## [Stops]
Please!

19:18.532 --> 19:20.700
Listen up! Listen up!

19:20.784 --> 19:24.370
Town is under quarantine.
We have you all under martial law.

19:24.454 --> 19:28.416
We'll take you all over to the high school.
We'll explain it to you over there.

19:28.500 --> 19:32.170
- [Chattering, Shouting]
- [Woman] Everybody out! Everybody out!

19:35.674 --> 19:39.552
- [Boy] What is this?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

19:39.636 --> 19:42.930
Hey! Hey!

19:49.563 --> 19:53.065
[Chattering, Indistinct]

19:54.359 --> 19:57.820
- The place is under emergency-
- Get out!

19:59.072 --> 20:03.159
- [Girls Screaming]
- Wait! Wait! I want a lawyer!

20:03.243 --> 20:05.119
[Screaming Continues]

20:05.245 --> 20:08.331
Mommy, Mommy,
what's happening?
Come with us, ma'am.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.958
Now, hold on, fellas.
Just what's going on here?

20:11.043 --> 20:15.504
- [Chattering Continues]
- [Man] We're not going no place
till we know more about this!

20:15.631 --> 20:18.216
It's the lights!
Where's Mommy?

20:18.300 --> 20:21.886
My mother! Get out!
It's my mother!

20:21.970 --> 20:25.181
Tell me what this is all about,
and maybe I'll cooperate with you!

20:25.265 --> 20:29.393
What's going on? Let go!
Please tell me what you're doing!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

20:29.478 --> 20:33.064
[Child Wailing]
No! I'm not going!

20:33.148 --> 20:34.732
Larry!

20:34.816 --> 20:38.402
- Hey! What's going on here?
- [Woman] For God's sake-

20:38.487 --> 20:41.155
- Where are we going?
- I want my doll.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.491
Here, sweetie.

20:44.826 --> 20:47.453
What's going on? Let me go!

20:47.537 --> 20:50.414
Come on!

20:50.499 --> 20:53.834
Come here, little fella.
[Grunting]

20:53.919 --> 20:57.004
- [Child Yells]
- [Toy Gun Firing]

20:57.130 --> 20:59.715
Sir, come with us!
What's going on?

20:59.800 --> 21:02.760
[Man]
Hey, leave her alone!
[Screaming]

21:02.844 --> 21:05.137
- [Child Continues Screaming]
- Hold it!

21:05.222 --> 21:08.516
[Chattering, Shouting]

21:08.600 --> 21:10.643
[Woman]
Leave her alone!

21:13.438 --> 21:16.232
- Don't give me that shit, boy.
- That's all right, soldier.

21:16.316 --> 21:18.276
[Ryder]
That's right. 0900. Check.

21:18.360 --> 21:22.029
Now, you listen to me, Ryder.
Buck's been telling me
what's going on here tonight.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.199
I don't mind telling you
we're mighty tired of being
pushed around like this.

21:25.284 --> 21:29.495
Yes, sir, I know.
We’ve just had no way of preparing
anybody for this kind of thing.

21:29.579 --> 21:32.540
It just kinda snowballed on us
and we were forced to take action.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.750
You said it would never come to this!

21:34.876 --> 21:40.047
Look, we've cooperated with you.
We've attempted to keep this thing quiet
in order not to create a panic.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.216
But, Christ,
we never expected this!

21:42.301 --> 21:44.844
Neither did we... sir.

21:44.928 --> 21:50.182
We're trying to get everyone
into the high school.
We're setting up an infirmary there.

21:50.267 --> 21:53.019
- Are we under martial law?
- Yes, sir.

21:53.145 --> 21:57.523
Well, let me tell you something.
You just can't walk all over the people
of Evans City that easy, Major.

21:57.607 --> 22:00.693
And as mayor of this town,
I'm protesting your action.

22:00.777 --> 22:03.696
In fact, I'd like to speak
to somebody higher up.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.824
Yes, sir. I'm Colonel Peckem.
Good evening. Major Ryder?

22:06.950 --> 22:10.244
Yes, sir.
I assume we don't need
the masks in the ultraviolet.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.747
That's correct, sir.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.874
I'll be with you gentlemen
in just a minute.

22:14.958 --> 22:18.169
I want to speak with Major Ryder
and find out exactly what's been happening.

22:18.253 --> 22:20.129
Major?
Yes, sir. Right this way.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.214
I'll be a son of a bitch.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.844
You don't smoke,
you bastard.
No.

22:26.928 --> 22:29.930
Where am I gonna
get me some smokes?

22:30.015 --> 22:32.391
- Hey, Clanker, that’s Judy.
- Sure it's her?

22:32.476 --> 22:34.393
Yes, I'm sure.
She's heading out to the fire.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.437
You sure?
Yes, I'm sure, damn it!

22:36.521 --> 22:38.981
Hey, be cool, buddy.
We'll get her.

22:46.573 --> 22:49.575
[Announcer On Radio]
Rainy and 65 outside the Big "K" studios.

22:52.954 --> 22:55.331
- She's giving it more gas.
- She doesn't know it's us.

22:55.415 --> 22:58.167
[Announcer On Radio]
It's 10 minutes before midnight.

22:58.251 --> 23:01.796
Almost time for headlines
with Bob Brewster.
This is Bob Lee.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.553
Judy!

23:09.638 --> 23:13.057
[Soldiers Chattering]

23:13.141 --> 23:16.685
[Clanker] What? What?
[Soldier]
Come over to the van.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.312
Move it back. Move out.

23:20.148 --> 23:23.401
- What's all this about?
- We're rounding everybody up
and taking them to the high school.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.653
What about my car?
Don't worry.
We'll take care of it.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.988
[Judy]
David, I feel stupid. Stupid!

23:28.073 --> 23:29.865
Shh.
You didn't know it was us.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.535
- Come on. Get up.
- Will you tell us what's going on?

23:32.619 --> 23:35.037
- [Soldier] Let's see it!
- Look, I'm a nurse.

23:35.122 --> 23:38.040
- What is it?
- I'm a nurse, I work for Dr. Brookmyre.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.793
I'm supposed to inoculate-
No, it's for him.
Get in the truck.

23:40.877 --> 23:43.587
Come on. Come on!
Hey, wait.

23:47.509 --> 23:50.010
You're clean.
Let's go. Come on.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.056
Hey, no problem.

23:54.182 --> 23:57.268
Okay, in the truck.
In the truck.
No problem, man.

23:57.394 --> 24:00.354
Look, I'm not causing
any problems.
In the truck. In the truck.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.023
Yet. Mothers.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.778
- Who's all here?
- Artie Fulton. My daughter's with me.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.990
- I heard you said you were
Dr. Brookmyre's nurse.
- Yes.

24:11.074 --> 24:14.118
I'm the appendectomy. The emergency
appendectomy at Christmastime?

24:14.202 --> 24:16.996
- Kathy?
- [Engine Revs]

24:17.122 --> 24:19.540
You okay?
Yes. Okay.

24:19.624 --> 24:22.042
- Who else is in here?
- That's Frank Winston.

24:22.169 --> 24:25.880
- I don't know what's wrong with him.
He seems to be sick.
- Know anything about what's going on?

24:25.964 --> 24:29.341
We were asleep and they
dragged us right out of the house.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.135
It's a quarantine.
What?

24:31.219 --> 24:34.096
It's a quarantine on the town.
Some kind of virus.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.599
[Fulton]
What about the soldiers?
[Judy] I don't know.

24:36.683 --> 24:39.393
- Said he'd send a medical team.
- We heard some shooting.

24:39.478 --> 24:43.355
- What kind of virus? Do you know what it is?
- Brookmyre just said it was highly contagious.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.942
- And it's dangerous.
- Maybe that's what he's got. Winston!

24:47.027 --> 24:49.028
Oh, Daddy, I'm all r-

24:50.238 --> 24:53.491
- We heard there were roadblocks up.
- The military's involved.

24:53.575 --> 24:56.160
This must really be big.

24:56.244 --> 24:58.162
David, I'm scared.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.498
It's all right.
It's all right, honey.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.000
Man, ain't this some shit.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.212
[Soldiers Chattering]

25:06.296 --> 25:08.214
[Baby Crying]

25:08.298 --> 25:10.966
Grab this one.
I got it.

25:11.051 --> 25:14.136
Did you get this one
over here?
Yeah, I'll get it.

25:14.221 --> 25:16.138
I want to set up
a second perimeter.

25:16.223 --> 25:18.974
The inside line
will continue to move in
toward the downtown area,

25:19.059 --> 25:20.726
bringing everything they find
with them.

25:20.810 --> 25:24.688
I want the second perimeter
two miles inside the first.

25:24.773 --> 25:27.942
This two-mile stretch'll be called,
uh, a no-man's land.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.361
Nothing can stay on it.
No one can cross it.

25:30.445 --> 25:33.948
- You're talking about
an awful lot of men, sir.
- We'll just have to get them in here.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.991
What do we have now?
Five companies.

25:36.076 --> 25:39.703
Why did this get down to the last minute?
These deployments should have been ready!

25:39.788 --> 25:42.790
Well, the initial information
was that the vaccine was harmless.

25:44.793 --> 25:47.378
You mean they didn't take
any precautionary action?

25:47.462 --> 25:50.839
Routine procedure.
I got here the day of the crash.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.217
Plane went down in these hills
above the town.

25:53.301 --> 25:56.470
Investigators reported
that the casings
wound up in the river.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.890
Apparently the water flows
through an underground reservoir...

25:59.975 --> 26:04.228
and Evans City is supplied
with artesian systems out of that.

26:04.312 --> 26:07.314
So I stayed in town, notified the police
and the town doctor...

26:07.399 --> 26:11.569
to be on the alert for any
high-fever symptoms or delirium.

26:11.653 --> 26:15.698
Sir, the report was that the Trixie team
had deactivated the vaccine.

26:15.782 --> 26:18.534
Major, Trixie wasn't
developed as a vaccine.

26:18.618 --> 26:22.121
Trixie was developed
as a bacteriological weapon.

26:22.247 --> 26:26.417
[Radio: Feedback]
Comm Central calling Colonel Peckem.
Comm Central, Colonel Peckem.

26:26.501 --> 26:29.295
- This is Peckem.
- Sir, we have completed
your voiceprint check.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.630
That's why the blackout.

26:31.756 --> 26:37.136
I knew the blackout
was to avoid embarrassment,
but a bioweapon never occurred to me.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.430
[Sighs]

26:39.514 --> 26:41.974
I fell for that story
hook, line and sinker.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.351
That was the idea.
[Man #1 On Radio]
Uh, Colonel Peckem-

26:44.436 --> 26:46.395
[Man #2 On Radio]
No, no, no, his first name.

26:46.479 --> 26:49.481
[Man #1]
Uh, Christopher. Chris. Chris.

26:49.566 --> 26:52.401
This is Brubaker, Chris.
Glad you're there.

26:52.485 --> 26:55.487
Major Ryder's a competent man
and a good officer,

26:55.572 --> 26:58.157
but I get the feeling
he's hitting the panic button
too prematurely.

26:58.241 --> 27:00.909
- Mr. Brubaker-
- You want a real evaluat-

27:01.036 --> 27:03.245
Mr. Brubaker.
What it's really like out there-

27:03.330 --> 27:05.706
[Shouting] Mr. Brubaker,
we're running out of time!

27:05.832 --> 27:11.128
If you want me to get the job done,
you get me the stuff I need and get it
before the morning's over!

27:11.212 --> 27:14.173
[Brookmyre]
Let us move over
to the high school!

27:14.257 --> 27:17.885
- We haven't got the room here to handle this!
- They're clearing the infirmary area, sir.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.346
We'll move over there as soon
as they complete disinfecting.

27:20.472 --> 27:24.558
I've heard that for the last three hours!
"Equipment and personnel
are on their way!"

27:24.643 --> 27:27.519
Why can't we call Unity?
If we can't go out,
surely we can let them in.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.064
We need that equipment!
I'm sorry, sir.

27:30.148 --> 27:34.568
We can't let them in.
We don't know how long
this quarantine will be in effect.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.529
We're talking about the lives
of the citizens of this city!

27:37.656 --> 27:41.825
We're also talking about the lives
of many of our own men, sir!
Your men are your worry, Sergeant!

27:41.910 --> 27:43.994
The people of this town are my worry!

27:44.120 --> 27:47.039
Message for Major Ryder sir.
Major Ryder's in with Colonel Peckem.
I'll take it.

27:47.123 --> 27:48.916
Heavy assembly, sir,
at the interstate highway.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.002
One of the trucks blew up
with masks and filters.
We have a lot of men hurt.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.254
- Any civilian casualties?
- Three dead, sir.

27:54.339 --> 27:56.965
Now, you just listen to me, mister.

27:57.050 --> 28:01.011
In addition to being mayor of this town,
I also happen to be a practicing attorney.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.013
I know the rights of civil law.

28:03.098 --> 28:06.558
Sergeant, I want a weapons search
of the entire town.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.560
That's stores included.
Confiscate everything.

28:08.645 --> 28:11.230
Just a minute!
I'm demanding a writ of habeas corpus.

28:11.314 --> 28:13.524
Sheriff,
I've gotta take your weapons.

28:13.608 --> 28:15.150
[Mayor]
Now, you just hold on!

28:15.235 --> 28:18.612
Don't you give 'em to him.
You don't have to!

28:18.697 --> 28:22.783
- Soldier.
- Look, you just can't
push us around this way!

28:22.867 --> 28:24.576
Don't you do it, Bucky!

28:26.246 --> 28:30.207
- [Groans]
- What the hell is going on here anyway?

28:30.291 --> 28:34.420
Sheriff, you're in a hopeless situation.
Don't make us use force.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.130
- Let's go.
- What we're doing here is for the g-

28:36.214 --> 28:38.757
- Let's get the hell outta here!
- Watch it!

28:38.842 --> 28:42.803
- Every civilian weapon
inside the perimeter area.
- [Gunshot]

28:45.932 --> 28:50.602
I want every damn civilian weapon
in the entire perimeter. Do you understand?

28:50.687 --> 28:52.146
Right away-

28:54.482 --> 28:58.318
Jesus Christ.

29:18.298 --> 29:21.175
Colonel!
Colonel Peckem, please, sir!

29:22.844 --> 29:26.346
This is exactly the kind of thing
we're trying to prevent!

29:26.598 --> 29:28.056
You ain't takin' me no place!

29:28.141 --> 29:30.434
- [Gunshot]
- Take cover!

29:30.518 --> 29:32.478
[Chattering, Shouting]

29:32.604 --> 29:35.189

- [Soldier]
Oh, man, this isn't getting anywhere!

29:35.273 --> 29:38.192
[Soldier]
Hey, he's shootin' at us, Burns!

29:39.194 --> 29:42.821
- Son of a bitch shootin' at us!
- Get in here, boy.
Come on! Get down!

29:44.699 --> 29:46.700
[Soldier]
Return fire!

29:52.540 --> 29:54.374
[Soldier]
Okay, hold your fire!

29:58.213 --> 30:01.381
All right, let's check it out!
Move in!

30:02.300 --> 30:04.593
Remember, he ain't hit
until I see him hit!

30:05.762 --> 30:08.639
[Groaning]
Keep away from me.
Keep away from me.

30:08.723 --> 30:11.934
I'll kill y-
[Gasps]

30:12.018 --> 30:15.229
- Lunatic, man.
- [Exhales]

30:15.313 --> 30:18.315
- ## [Piano]
- Take a look at this, man.

30:18.399 --> 30:20.442

## [Continues]
[Soldier]
A recital.

30:23.905 --> 30:27.157

No wonder they want us
to round 'em all up.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.660
[Door Opening]

30:29.744 --> 30:33.247

Oh, Jesus Chri-Jesus!

31:23.923 --> 31:26.550

I'm bleedin' bad.

31:26.634 --> 31:28.844
- Ma'am?
- Hello.

31:28.928 --> 31:33.015
I'm bleedin' bad!
I'm bleedin'! I'm bleedin'!

31:34.058 --> 31:36.643
- Maybe we're in some kind of war.
- Shut up a minute!

Come on, let's go! You two!
Lets go, mister!

32:19.437 --> 32:21.730
Get back here, or we'll shoot!

32:21.814 --> 32:23.774

No!

[Man Muttering]
Thiryt-five cents a gallon.

32:33.451 --> 32:37.079
[Muttering Continues]
Fifty-eight cents.

32:37.163 --> 32:40.374
Goddamn it, what's going on?
What's happening?
I said, what's going on?

32:40.458 --> 32:42.751
Give me a fuckin' answer!
Come on!

32:42.835 --> 32:45.379
Come on, soldier! Soldier!
Stay with me! What's going on?

32:45.463 --> 32:48.090
- David, come on!
- Hey, man!
- Hey! Soldier!

32:48.174 --> 32:50.342
- What's going on?
Tell me what's happening!
- David!

32:50.468 --> 32:53.053
Come on!
Soldier, why are you here?
Tell me!

32:53.137 --> 32:55.055
- Come on, soldier!
- David, please!

32:55.139 --> 32:59.309
[Man Mutters] Crazy fuckers.
I think you’re all crazy. Every one of you.

32:59.394 --> 33:02.104
Pretty funny, you think, huh?
That isn't the army.

33:02.188 --> 33:05.732
- Pull out of there! Let's go!
- [Man Muttering]
You knew who the people were.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.193
[Engine Starts]

33:10.822 --> 33:13.323
Go on! Take off!

33:13.408 --> 33:14.783
David, the hypodermic!

33:20.289 --> 33:22.833
Check those two guys out
over there.
Hey, they're gone!

33:22.917 --> 33:26.003
- They're in the van! They took off in the van!
- Welcome, brothers!

33:26.129 --> 33:29.756
Get that guy
out of the gas station.
They took- They took off!

34:01.789 --> 34:04.124
[Van Stops]

34:13.509 --> 34:16.011
Hey, buddy! We lost 'em!

34:16.094 --> 34:17.763
- Where you headin'?
- I don't know!

34:17.847 --> 34:20.974
Try the hills by the country club!
Maybe we can hole up there!

34:21.059 --> 34:23.310
I got ya, boss!

34:30.777 --> 34:33.570
[Shouting]

34:36.657 --> 34:39.159
[Gunfire]

34:57.887 --> 35:00.430
[Man]
No, it only affects primates.

35:00.515 --> 35:05.393
At least we don't have to worry
about its being spread by dogs or cats.

35:05.478 --> 35:08.271
Whatever consolation
that may be to you.

35:08.356 --> 35:12.567
Unless there are any pet monkeys hereabouts,
the only ones infected will be human beings.

35:12.652 --> 35:16.321
If we catch it in the early stages,
can it be reversed?

35:16.405 --> 35:21.827
Oh, we searched for an antidote
the three years that project
was in existence, Doctor.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.371
No dice.
How many are based
in the area, Sergeant?

35:24.455 --> 35:27.249
Don't know.
They haven't called me.

35:27.333 --> 35:30.377
- Dr. Watts, I thought you-
- I haven't even been able to call
any commanders yet.

35:30.503 --> 35:35.006
They told me I could use the radio
on the plane, but it wasn't piped through
your alternate network.

35:35.133 --> 35:39.344
We're using the alternates
to avoid any chance of a leak.
Ah, yes. Precious security.

35:39.428 --> 35:42.931
Keep it under wraps at all costs.
Meanwhile, do you realize
the blunder that's been made?

35:43.057 --> 35:46.977
We can have you flown back
as soon as we run a compete med check
and get a clearance from Washington.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.563
- Let's get started.
- We don't have all our equipment in yet.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.984
Beautiful.
And when'll that be?

35:54.110 --> 35:56.695
As soon as possible.
Appropriately vague, Colonel.

35:56.779 --> 36:00.740
Look, it's you think boys who
created this thing in the first place.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.742
Oh, that's beautiful.

36:02.827 --> 36:06.288
I'm one of the only chances we have.

36:06.372 --> 36:10.542
I can't get back to a lab
because you're not equipped
to run a medical check,

36:10.626 --> 36:13.044
which we wouldn't need in the first place
if I hadn't been packed off here!

36:13.171 --> 36:16.464
The whole operation
is one fat blunder!
You talk about blunders.

36:16.549 --> 36:20.010
According to the report from your team,
the virus was considered inactive.

36:20.094 --> 36:23.180
"Considered."
Yes. That's the important word.

36:23.264 --> 36:26.766
Any man on the team will tell you
that means 99%, maybe.

36:26.851 --> 36:31.313
That's a standard we don't set, Colonel.
That's set by the military.

36:31.397 --> 36:35.317
- We're not getting anywhere
trying to assign blame.
- Then authorize me back to the lab!

36:35.401 --> 36:39.029
I can't take a chance on breaking the perimeter
with somebody that might be a carrier.

36:39.113 --> 36:42.741
Trixie has been in these waters
for six days!

36:42.825 --> 36:47.078
Some truck driver could have taken it out of here
long before you set up that perimeter.

36:47.205 --> 36:51.875
We're going under the assumption
we've got it contained. We're gonna
keep it contained until it runs its course.

36:51.959 --> 36:54.711
- Runs its course?
- You said it can't stay active
in the ultraviolet light.

36:54.795 --> 36:57.172
It's in the water, man!
Underground!

36:57.256 --> 36:59.925
It's obviously in people too.

37:00.009 --> 37:03.637
People are vectors.
They carry it about with them unawares.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.722
The incubation period may vary, Colonel,

37:05.806 --> 37:10.769
but ultimately Trixie is going to
spread throughout this entire town!

37:10.853 --> 37:14.356
- The town is sealed off.
- Oh, Colonel.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.067
Look, shortly before
the funds ran out,

37:17.151 --> 37:20.737
two of my technicians caught this bug
from a rhesus monkey.

37:20.821 --> 37:26.493
One of them was delirious for two days
before he finally died.

37:26.577 --> 37:31.748
The other phased in and out
until he finally went hopelessly mad.

37:31.832 --> 37:36.711
Those are the two ultimate effects
of this thing. It's not just gonna
run its course and be forgotten.

37:36.796 --> 37:39.714
How are you guys
gonna explain away a town...

37:39.799 --> 37:42.717
that's either wiped out
or reduced to mindlessness?

37:42.802 --> 37:44.386
[Laughs]

37:44.470 --> 37:47.806
What is this, another piece of information
they forgot to pass on to you guys?

37:47.890 --> 37:51.059
Oh, gentlemen,
we're not dealing with a flu virus here.

37:51.143 --> 37:53.436
We're dealing with
an often lethal,

37:53.521 --> 37:57.440
always debilitating
encephalitic mutation.

37:59.610 --> 38:03.405
It leaves its victims
either dead or incurably mad.

38:03.489 --> 38:05.448
You got that?

38:15.793 --> 38:17.585
What are you doing?

38:19.755 --> 38:21.464
Nitwit.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.675
Somebody's gonna
see you out there.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.304

to hurt you.
I know.

38:49.618 --> 38:52.787
It's not you.
It's not what you did.
[Clears Throat]

38:52.872 --> 38:55.373
You're nice.
I like you very much.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.293

- I'm sorry for being such a little girl.

38:58.377 --> 39:00.211
It's okay. I understand.

39:00.296 --> 39:02.672
I mean,
l- I knew that people die.

39:02.757 --> 39:05.216
Yeah?
You know,
I knew people died.

Your father?

39:08.971 --> 39:10.513
You understand?

39:10.598 --> 39:14.893
It's like, uh, all- all these people...

39:14.977 --> 39:18.605
dying and, uh, my father...

39:18.689 --> 39:20.690
can't feel that.

39:22.485 --> 39:24.277
You can.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.280
I know you can. I-

39:36.123 --> 39:37.791
I have it, don't I?

39:37.875 --> 39:40.335

Hey, reveille, buddy.
We gonna move?

40:11.200 --> 40:12.534
We'll be right up.

40:12.618 --> 40:16.913
Hey, I found some cigarettes, man.
I had to break a machine open.

40:16.997 --> 40:18.832
There's all kinds of goodies
around this place.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.126
- Any food?
- Yeah, food and drink.

40:22.711 --> 40:25.255
- Just don't get yourself tanked.
- No, I'm just warming up.

40:25.339 --> 40:28.258

we should try to get out?

40:28.342 --> 40:29.926
I don't know, man.

These new two
are gonna slow us up, buddy.
That chick's got the bug.

40:34.014 --> 40:36.015
I gotta think about it.

40:36.100 --> 40:39.686
- Hey, I came up with a radio.
- What'd it say? Anything about what's going on?

40:39.812 --> 40:43.356
No, just, uh, music.
It's really weird.
Yeah.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.983
We'll be up in a minute.

40:45.067 --> 40:48.194
Hey, if that chick's got the bug,
we could catch it from her, right?

40:48.279 --> 40:50.363
It depends on what it is.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.407
Well, it's a bug.
We could catch it, can't we?

40:52.491 --> 40:54.325
We'll be up in a minute.

40:55.578 --> 40:57.495
Yeah, okay.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.373
I mean, it’s just... a little ol' bug, right?
Can't be much-

41:00.458 --> 41:02.750

I never could figure that out.

41:45.628 --> 41:47.504
I hardly even knew him.

41:47.630 --> 41:50.548
Well, I didn't know that.
I saw you with him.
When?

I figured, big football hero.

I didn't know what you were like.

Wait a minute. Say that again, Chris.

42:58.659 --> 43:01.286
Three-six-one-three.
Three-six...

43:01.412 --> 43:05.331
We've got about two-thirds
of the population accounted for.
One-three.

We've got an open revolt.
It's turning into a war zone.

get them into that high school.

Chris, make that your main objective
at this point. Understand?

43:14.800 --> 43:16.676
Just don't let
those perimeters break.

43:16.802 --> 43:22.181
The perimeters are holding, but we've
got about 50 square miles of woods and hills
that we've still gotta cover.

What's your estimates, Chris?
How much time?

43:24.143 --> 43:28.104
I can't tell you
how long it's gonna take.
We talking about hours, days, or what?

43:28.188 --> 43:30.356
Give me a ballpark.
I just can't.

43:30.441 --> 43:33.067
All right, all right,
keep it locked up,

43:33.152 --> 43:36.070
and let us know as soon as you do.

43:36.155 --> 43:39.198
Standing order, Chuck.
Get this out.

43:39.283 --> 43:44.037
Anyone obviously infected or resisting
is to be treated as an enemy,

43:44.121 --> 43:47.081
with the ultimate objective
to bring them in at any cost.

43:47.166 --> 43:48.458
Yes, sir.
Chuck.

43:48.542 --> 43:50.752
- Yes, sir?
- We've gotta burn the bodies.

43:51.712 --> 43:55.548
- Sir-
- I'll listen to any alternatives, soldier,
but until I hear a good one you burn them.

43:58.260 --> 44:02.472
[Ryder]
"A" Company reports
two men possibly infected.

44:02.556 --> 44:06.184
Sir, the men are getting panicky.
Some of the men haven't even
been told why they're here.

44:06.268 --> 44:09.646
Of course not, Major.
That would just constitute a security leak.

44:09.730 --> 44:12.940
One of the objectives
is to keep this thing quiet, yes.

44:13.025 --> 44:15.526
But the main objective
is to keep the virus contained.

44:15.611 --> 44:18.404
If those men know the truth,
they'll be breaking
the perimeter themselves.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.406
- How can you tell?
- What?

44:22.242 --> 44:23.910
Don't you see?

The whole thing's insane.
How can you tell
who's infected and who isn't?

44:28.248 --> 44:31.751
- They can't get the helicopters in here
for another 15 or 20 hours.
- Goddamn it!

44:31.877 --> 44:35.880
- There's a police bird and two city-owned
choppers out at the community field.
- Get them in the air!

44:35.964 --> 44:39.425
- What sort of authorization will I need?
- Anything! Use your rifle if necessary.

44:39.510 --> 44:43.763
I want them in the air,
inside the perimeter,
radio-linked with the ground.

and keep circling the no-man's-land
day and night.

gets one warning shot.

- Is that clear?

44:52.189 --> 44:53.898
One warning shot.

44:59.363 --> 45:01.280
What's going on at Trixie?

45:01.365 --> 45:04.701
Take 'em upwards of days
just to reprogram all that data, Colonel.

45:04.785 --> 45:07.704
Until then, we won't even be able
to re-create the virus itself.

45:07.788 --> 45:10.498
And afterwards,
with the incubation period,

45:10.582 --> 45:13.501
my guess is a good week
to infect a new set of monkeys.

45:13.585 --> 45:16.629
We have got to start
taking blood samples,

45:16.714 --> 45:21.175
and we've got to start flying them
out to Dietrich so they can at least
have a sample of the active virus.

45:21.301 --> 45:23.886
We can't send anything out.
We've got
human guinea pigs here.

45:26.598 --> 45:29.934

and we've got to start flying it out.

- We can't send anything out yet.
- Can't you see-

45:32.354 --> 45:35.940
What do you want to do,
send 'em out in empty pop bottles?

45:36.024 --> 45:40.111

- We need airtight canisters.

the other decontamination gear.

45:49.163 --> 45:52.248
I don't mean to jump on you, Colonel.

45:52.332 --> 45:56.919

at how shoddy this operation is.

get off your ass and start collecting them?

have a chem lab?
- Yes, sir.

- The man thinks the army is our friend.

that we're doing the right thing.

- Yeah, well, ask Sheriff Cooper.
- [David] Whatever they're here for,
it's turned into a riot.

47:47.948 --> 47:52.910
Maybe they are just here for control.
If they can turn a campus protest
into a shooting war.

47:53.036 --> 47:57.081
Some of the rednecks that live in this area,
they could be shooting at each other
and not even care why.

we may all have been exposed.
We may need medical attention.

48:08.468 --> 48:12.889

Maybe somebody's hitting us
with bacteriological weapons or something.

48:12.973 --> 48:14.432

Hey, Dave!

55:47.010 --> 55:50.095
You're forgettin' about the infantry.
Let's go.
Huh?

[People Chattering, Shouting]
The crazies in here are detained,
but they might not be infected.

55:56.978 --> 55:59.063
Keep them somewhere else.
Keep 'em isolated.
[Man] Yes, sir.

55:59.147 --> 56:01.648
We're using the gymnasium
for any consulting.

56:01.733 --> 56:05.402

56:20.001 --> 56:22.044

I'll need a hand with this.

56:29.803 --> 56:32.221

Got a blood pressure yet?
[Nurse] 124 over 67.

All right, keep checking.

Get it off of me! Get it off!

56:51.032 --> 56:52.908
Get another nurse over here,
will you, please.

56:52.992 --> 56:55.744
These goddamn things returned.

56:55.829 --> 56:58.664
- Don't you med guys have anything
more powerful than this?
- No, sir.

56:58.748 --> 57:00.416
- [Man On Speaker] Hey, uh, Elly?
- Yes?

57:00.542 --> 57:03.836
I'm not getting any further
on that formula.
For Christ sake. It's in the written records.

57:03.920 --> 57:06.213
We can't read
the microfilms manually, Elly.

57:06.339 --> 57:09.007
We're gonna have to wait
until it's all in the computer.
[Exhales Sharply]

57:09.092 --> 57:12.302
Once it's all back in the computer,
we can have it in
a matter of seconds.

57:12.387 --> 57:14.638
But it won't be all
in the computer for three days!

57:14.764 --> 57:19.143
We'll just have to try
all the combinations.
You gotta get a sample flown out to us.

57:19.269 --> 57:21.770
Lots of luck.
Say again.
I'm not reading you, Elly.

57:21.855 --> 57:24.481
I said I'll see what I can do.
Give me Peckem.

57:24.566 --> 57:27.943
Yes, sir.
To Colonel Peckem's headquarters.
We'll have to have your voiceprint.

57:28.027 --> 57:30.946
Christ sake!
He's only down the street from me.
I just left him!

57:31.030 --> 57:35.534
We'll need to check it, sir,
if it's to go through the network.
We'll have to do a recording.

57:35.660 --> 57:37.911
Here, you run this over to Peckem.
To Colonel Peckem, sir?

57:37.996 --> 57:42.040
Tell Peckem without those samples,
Dietrich might as well close down.

57:42.125 --> 57:46.211
If he still refuses to send them out,
have him call Dietrich himself
and explain it.

57:46.337 --> 57:49.131
But get him the hell
off my back!
Yes, sir. I'll try.

57:49.215 --> 57:52.968
On that voiceprint, sir,
will you state your name and I.D.?

57:53.052 --> 57:58.515

fat, electronic ass!

[Glass Clanging]

58:10.445 --> 58:13.989
What's the matter with you, woman?
Ultraviolet's not infallible when
you're working this closely with it.

58:14.073 --> 58:17.075
- So put your mask back on.
- As you have discovered, Doctor,

58:17.160 --> 58:22.206
it's very difficult looking
into a microscope
when you're wearing a mask.

58:25.293 --> 58:29.796
Just how would you rate
our chances, Doctor?

58:29.881 --> 58:31.673
- Do you have any family outside?
- What?

58:31.758 --> 58:34.092
Do you have any family outside?

58:34.177 --> 58:37.346
No, sir.
Hmm.

58:37.430 --> 58:41.225
Me neither.
I'm sorry, sir.

58:42.185 --> 58:44.770
Would you marry me?

58:44.854 --> 58:46.271
Hmm?

58:48.233 --> 58:49.983
[Laughs]

58:52.820 --> 58:57.741
I assume from that answer
that you rate our chances as good.

59:02.205 --> 59:05.207
- [Chuckles]
- No, next week. Of course right now!

59:05.291 --> 59:08.126
- That's army issue, Doctor! Army issue!
- All right, where is she?

59:08.211 --> 59:11.463
- Doctor Brookmyre's nurse, sir.
- He sent her out! He sent her out with these!

59:11.589 --> 59:15.759
- What happened, Major?
- Apparently, Dr. Brookmyre sent
his nurse out with some of the antibiotics.

59:15.885 --> 59:18.095
When was this?
Early last night,
just after things started.

59:18.179 --> 59:20.973
- We recovered the materials, sir,
when they were captured.
- "They?"

59:21.099 --> 59:24.810
Yes, sir. There were
several of them. At least there were.
They got away last night in one of the vans.

59:24.894 --> 59:27.229
The van was found,
but there was no sign of anyone.

59:27.313 --> 59:30.148
- This is army issue! Army issue!
- Take Dr. Russell to the infirmary.
Run a check on him.

59:30.233 --> 59:33.443
- Yes, sir.
- This is army issue!
There's no requisition!

59:33.528 --> 59:35.946
This is- This is army issue!

59:36.030 --> 59:38.865
You know if your nurse was exposed
to any infected cases?

59:38.950 --> 59:41.368
Very briefly.
We had the two children here.

59:41.452 --> 59:45.706
- [Shouting]
Why in the hell did you send her out?
- She's-

59:45.790 --> 59:47.374
She's pregnant.

59:48.459 --> 59:50.252
I was afraid for the child.

59:50.336 --> 59:54.298
I sent her with some antibiotic
for the father.

59:55.341 --> 59:57.134
They're gonna be married.

59:58.678 --> 01:00:04.266

Why don't we just scurry around
and pass by 'em?

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:19.049
It's almost dark. Let's wait.
We need information.

01:01:19.133 --> 01:01:21.259
Why don't we just go down
and talk to them?

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:23.929
- Get her! Get her down!
- I really would like to talk.

You never know what you're doing
or why you're doing it.

because you're told to.

movin' out of here?

- We're doin' this my way, you hear?

It's a quarantine.
There's a virus loose in the area.
How'd the army get involved?

What kind of virus is it?
Oh, I don't know.

The army only tells us
what they have to.

01:06:51.048 --> 01:06:53.758
It's in the water.
In the water?

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:49.957
Hey, David.
Why don't you put me in for...

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:52.585
a Congressional Medal of Honor?

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.965
Hey!

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:00.551
Hey! Where you goin'?

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:04.180
Uh, just goin' up to see Judy.
What?

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:07.975
It's okay. I'm just goin' up
to see Judy for a while.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:11.062
Oh, yeah.
[Chuckles]

01:09:11.188 --> 01:09:15.441
I know what you mean.
It's okay.
We'll be in the bedroom.

01:09:15.526 --> 01:09:17.609
- Yeah.
- Hey!

01:09:17.694 --> 01:09:19.737
[Door Opens]

01:09:22.741 --> 01:09:25.535
[Clank]
My head feels funny.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.622
- Did I do something wrong?
- You did what you had to do.

01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:32.959
Hey, I didn't do
anything wrong, did I?
No, no, it's all right, Clanker.

01:09:33.042 --> 01:09:35.627
- Huh?
- It's all right.
You did what you had to do.

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:38.006
Okay.

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:40.675
[Exhales]
I'll take first watch, okay?

01:09:40.759 --> 01:09:42.426
Good.

01:09:43.761 --> 01:09:45.805
Okay. I'll see you later.

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:05.950
She's all I have left.

01:10:06.952 --> 01:10:10.413
My wife is dead- Mae.

01:10:10.497 --> 01:10:12.999
That's my wife.

01:10:13.083 --> 01:10:15.376
She's been dead
a couple of years now.

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:18.171
Kathy's infected obviously.
Artie's acting weird.

01:10:18.255 --> 01:10:22.133
Even though Clank's going,
he's fightin', but he's losin'. But not us.

01:10:22.259 --> 01:10:26.888
And God knows
we've been exposed to it.
Well, I had that injection.

01:10:26.972 --> 01:10:30.350
Brookmyre said it wasn't an antidote,
just a strong antibiotic.

01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:34.020
- Maybe that's enough.
- You didn't have your shot.

01:10:34.104 --> 01:10:37.232
But I feel all right.

01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:40.443
David, honey,

01:10:40.527 --> 01:10:44.280
it's possible that you have
a natural immunity to it.

01:10:46.158 --> 01:10:48.243
We still have to go away.

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:51.412
Hey. We can make it.

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:53.498
I know it.

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:57.043
I haven't allowed her to date yet.

01:10:57.127 --> 01:11:00.713
I don't think she's old enough
to date yet.

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:04.676
The way these kids are today,
it's disgusting. It's disgusting!

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:09.013
These kids today, they're pigs!

01:11:13.227 --> 01:11:15.228
Not my little girl-

01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:18.064
No, sir.

01:11:20.526 --> 01:11:24.028
I'll never let her
get into that kind of trouble.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:28.866
I owe that much to Mae.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:31.202
I'll never let her get
into that kind of trouble.

01:11:33.914 --> 01:11:36.249

[Phone Rings]

01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:51.889
Well, we can't wait forever
to break the story.

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:54.684
I'm for going
with the radiation scenario.

01:11:54.768 --> 01:11:58.521
The thing is,
we can release it now,
and it covers us for any eventuality.

01:11:58.605 --> 01:12:01.441
But the onus on it.
Sure, it's embarrassing.

01:12:01.525 --> 01:12:04.068
But it's not as embarrassing
as bioweaponry.

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:07.864
At least everybody knows
we've been using nuclear weapons.

01:12:07.948 --> 01:12:10.867
So we had an accident.
We'll blame it on A.E.C.

01:12:10.951 --> 01:12:14.287
But how do we release it now
before we know?

01:12:14.371 --> 01:12:17.665
We say there were nuclear weapons
on the plane when it went down.

01:12:19.209 --> 01:12:22.003
If the perimeter doesn't hold,
we're gonna have to go the whole way.

01:12:22.087 --> 01:12:26.382
We say there was a live weapon
on the plane not destroyed
when it went down.

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:28.634
We got a team workin' on it.

01:12:30.262 --> 01:12:34.932
If we have to push the button,
we just say the... weapon went off.

01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:39.354
For Christ sake! We're talking
about one of our own towns
and fifteen-hundred of our own troops.

01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:42.190
The town is already destroyed.

01:12:42.316 --> 01:12:46.736
If they can't hold that perimeter,
we're lookin' at the possibility of Trixie
spreading across the entire country.

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:50.281
You break that perimeter,
then we gotta drop the bomb.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:51.783
Like immediately.

01:12:53.243 --> 01:12:55.411
And God knows
I hope we don't have to,

01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:58.998
but if we do, we- we gotta have
some kind of explanation.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.378
I'm just being realistic.

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:06.464
The radiation scenario covers us.

01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:10.676

- This is Brubaker.

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:14.055
Yes, sir, we've completed
your voiceprint check,
and we have the president on the line.

01:13:14.139 --> 01:13:15.807
In a minute we'll hook you in.

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:19.394
- Mr. Brubaker, this is the president.
- Yes, Mr. President.

01:13:19.478 --> 01:13:22.855
Give me your consensus
on the press release.

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.857
[Brubaker]
Nothing unanimous, sir.

01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:28.736
But there is a majority in favor
of the radiation scenario.

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:32.281
Safest, I suppose.
Yes, sir.

01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:33.908
The bombers still up?

01:13:33.992 --> 01:13:37.537
Round the clock, sir.
Sixty thousand feet over Evans City.

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:40.206
Thank you, Mr. Brubaker.
Sir?

01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:45.420
- Yes.
- We'd, uh, like to
leave this line open, sir.

01:13:45.504 --> 01:13:50.383
If those perimeters break,
we'll have to act immediately.

01:13:50.467 --> 01:13:52.051
And we'll, uh-

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:55.513
We'll need your permission, sir,
to, uh, use the weapon.

01:13:56.974 --> 01:14:01.185
Uh, we want to leave the line open, sir,
to, uh, avoid voiceprint delay.

01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:05.022
Sir?

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:09.694

01:14:48.066 --> 01:14:51.110

right down the middle.

on the 18th hole.

but they won't authorize anything...

I'm scared, man.
I flip out and I can't control myself.

01:22:09.507 --> 01:22:12.384
- Come on, Clanker. Will you move.
- Hey, big man.

01:22:12.969 --> 01:22:14.637
Big green hat.

01:22:14.721 --> 01:22:16.013
Move it!
Tell me where I should meet you.

01:22:16.139 --> 01:22:18.015
For God's sakes.
Come on, man.
Tell me where I should meet you.

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:21.060
- Clanker.
- Goddamn it, tell me where
I should meet you!

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:27.775
I know. Meet ya down
at the Zebra Club.

01:22:27.859 --> 01:22:31.153
- Hey, no, man, no. Listen.
- Remember the Zebra Club
outside of Bragg? I'll meet you there.

01:22:31.237 --> 01:22:34.865
- Listen. Out by the old concrete plant.
- I'll meet ya there and we'll drink 'em blind.

01:22:34.991 --> 01:22:38.327
I'll take care of these guys.
I'm gonna meet ya at the Zebra Club.
Okay? The Zebra Club, man.

01:22:38.411 --> 01:22:42.206
Hey! Hey!

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:44.291
Hey!

01:22:57.222 --> 01:23:01.183
Hey, David.
You got the brains, man.
What are we gonna do?

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:06.730
The goddamn bug.

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:10.275
I got the goddamn bug!

01:23:13.738 --> 01:23:16.740
[Men Chattering]

01:23:18.868 --> 01:23:21.078
[Man]
Hit him!

01:23:22.414 --> 01:23:24.248
He's a crazy son of a bitch,
ain't he?

01:23:25.417 --> 01:23:28.419
[Clank]
Watch your asses,
you chickenshits in those white suits!

01:23:28.545 --> 01:23:31.964
Where the hell's he at?
[Clank] I'm gonna say hello
to these goddamn white uniforms.

01:23:32.048 --> 01:23:35.134
- [Man]
Spread out, goddamn it!
- [Gunfire]

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.011
Where are you going?
Keep your eyes open.

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:38.554
There he is!
[Gunfire Continues]

01:23:38.638 --> 01:23:41.223
[Men Chattering]

01:23:43.435 --> 01:23:47.396
[Man]
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire until you can see him!

[Men Chattering]

01:23:50.775 --> 01:23:53.527
[Man #2]
I'm staying right here.
I'm not gonna move.

01:23:53.653 --> 01:23:56.530
Stay low! Stay low.
That son of a bitch
can sure see us, man.

01:23:56.614 --> 01:23:59.033
All right, let's move in slow.
[Gunfire]

01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:01.243
Fire! Fire! Fire!

01:24:04.247 --> 01:24:05.831
I can't see a thing.
Am I movin'?

01:24:05.915 --> 01:24:07.916
Move in.
Stick to your right.

01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:11.336
Stay low, you guys. Stay low.
It's starting to come over the railing.

01:24:46.122 --> 01:24:47.873

[Clicks]

01:25:23.326 --> 01:25:26.537
Hey, buddy, looks like it won't work.
Out of ammunition, man.

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:30.290
Son of a bitch!
Won't work, right?
[Clicks]

01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:33.627
It's your ass, man.
Just sit there and sweat it, man.

01:25:50.854 --> 01:25:53.105
We're gonna do us some drinkin'.

01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:55.274
[Gunshot]

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:20.424
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hold it.

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:24.011
Am I going blind,

01:26:24.095 --> 01:26:27.431
or is this configuration smaller
than it was?

01:26:33.146 --> 01:26:34.605
Hmm? Smaller?

01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:37.774
I don't know what it is
you're looking for.
[Scoffs]

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:45.115
Sure.

01:26:46.117 --> 01:26:48.702
What's the combination
for this stuff?

01:26:50.622 --> 01:26:52.706
Uh, 44 and 23.

01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:55.584
Ink up another slide.
The same thing.

01:26:57.003 --> 01:26:59.546
A million to one we'd find it.

01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:01.632
But this is it.

01:27:02.634 --> 01:27:05.052
I'm sure of it.
Goddamn it, this is it!

01:27:06.804 --> 01:27:09.389
Give me Dietrich.
[Man On Speaker]
Uh, yes, we'll have to check your-

01:27:09.474 --> 01:27:12.851
I know. I know. The voiceprint.
Are you recording?

01:27:12.936 --> 01:27:14.937
One minute, sir.

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:18.899
[Watts]
Come on. Oh, Christ.

01:27:18.983 --> 01:27:20.692
[Bangs Mouthpiece]

01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:29.243
Well!

01:27:29.327 --> 01:27:30.869
[Man On Speaker]
Recording, sir.

01:27:30.954 --> 01:27:34.164
Watts, Dr. Elston. Special unit three,
seven, four, three, two, seven.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:37.960
Code name: Trixie.
Section: Research and Development.

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:41.046
We have that, sir,
and we'll put it right through.
Hustle, will you.

01:27:44.592 --> 01:27:47.469
It is bigger here!

01:27:47.553 --> 01:27:50.013
It's bigger than all
the other individual samples.

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:52.891
Goddamn it, woman, this is it!
This is it!

01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:54.518
We gotta get this stuff
off to Dietrich.

01:27:54.644 --> 01:27:57.479
I don't understand the significance-
You don't have to understand.

01:27:57.563 --> 01:28:01.608
- Just have faith.
- If you were to explain it to me, sir,
I could be of more help.

01:28:01.693 --> 01:28:03.360
Get me Peckem.

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:07.239
Uh, your line is hooked into Central
on that voiceprint check, sir.

01:28:07.323 --> 01:28:09.574
Oh, I asked him for another line!

01:28:09.659 --> 01:28:12.160
We can cancel that, sir,
and make this new-
[Watts] Listen.

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:15.580
- Yes, sir.
- When you get me Dietrich, can you put it
through to me at Peckem's headquarters?

01:28:15.665 --> 01:28:17.874
Yes, I think-
Yes, sir, we can do that.

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:21.086
Okay, then do it.
I'm going over there right now.
If anything comes, hold it.

01:28:21.212 --> 01:28:24.923
I'll be there in two minutes.
This is very urgent.
Yes, sir. Will do.

01:28:28.845 --> 01:28:31.221
Watch those slides.
And call me if anything
different happens.

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:34.182
Yes, but what am I looking for, sir?

01:28:34.267 --> 01:28:37.019
[All Chattering, Shouting]

01:28:37.937 --> 01:28:40.439
- Hold it there.
- Wait. Listen to me. Listen to me!

01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:42.316
Hold on there.
Will you listen to me?
I'm Dr. Watts!

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:45.902
I'm a scientist!
I'm with the team!
I've got a tube of Trixie here!

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:48.488
- [Mutters]
- Will you listen to me!

01:28:48.573 --> 01:28:52.576
I'm working on the virus!
Will you listen to me!
This is a mistake! Will you shut-

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:55.662
Please, God, I will-

01:28:55.747 --> 01:28:59.166
They've got a voiceprint on me!
I don't need a backup!

01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:01.376
This is a mistake!

01:29:01.461 --> 01:29:05.672
[All Chattering, Shouting]

01:29:05.757 --> 01:29:08.258
Will you shut up!
Let me go!

01:29:08.343 --> 01:29:12.179
Look at that! I see-

01:29:12.263 --> 01:29:14.765
[Gunfire]

01:29:14.849 --> 01:29:17.934

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:42.876
[Birds Twittering]

01:29:47.507 --> 01:29:49.883
It's gotta be the perimeter.

01:29:51.511 --> 01:29:53.804
You gotta remember
to do exactly what I tell you.

01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:56.640
Promise, no matter what.
I promise, David.

01:29:58.059 --> 01:30:01.144
- You okay?
- I'm fine, and ready.

01:30:03.439 --> 01:30:07.442
I'm fine, David, really.
I want to rest somewhere.

01:30:09.195 --> 01:30:11.988
Now listen to me.
They're gonna be comin' through here.

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:14.032
If they don't see us,
they'll pass us by.

01:30:14.117 --> 01:30:16.493
And we'll be on the outside, huh?

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:18.578
We'll be out.

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:22.165
How long will I be alone?

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:25.544
- Not long.
- It's the only thing that scares me.

01:30:25.628 --> 01:30:27.546
Why can't you come in with me?

01:30:27.630 --> 01:30:29.506
I can't place the blocks
from the inside.

01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:37.139
- David, where will you be?
- I'll hide up in the tower.

01:30:38.391 --> 01:30:42.936
You're gonna hear them come through.
They'll probably search the grounds.

01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:45.355
You just be real quiet
until they pass by.

01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:49.943
- And I'll come back to get you.
- They'll never find me.

01:30:50.069 --> 01:30:53.697
[Laughs]
They'll never-
They will never find us.

01:30:55.158 --> 01:30:57.117
Us?

01:30:57.243 --> 01:31:01.121
David, they might find you.
No, no. I can hide.
They'll never find either of us.

01:31:01.205 --> 01:31:04.541
- But what if they do?
- They won't.

01:31:07.253 --> 01:31:09.254
They won't.

01:31:10.631 --> 01:31:14.801
Now listen to me.
After you hear them pass,
you be real quiet.

01:31:14.886 --> 01:31:17.596
And after they leave
and they go far away,

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:19.556
I'll come back to get ya.

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:23.602
If I don't come back to get ya,

01:31:23.686 --> 01:31:26.938
you wait a long time,
and then you leave by yourself.

01:31:27.023 --> 01:31:30.025
Oh, no. No, David.
I can't go anywhere without you.

01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:33.695
- Now, don't worry. I'll- I'll meet ya.
- Where?

01:31:33.779 --> 01:31:35.739
I'll meet ya at-
The Zebra Club.

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:37.991
- I remembered, David. I remembered.
- Oh, no.

01:31:38.075 --> 01:31:41.244
No, not at the Zebra Club.
I'll meet ya at, uh-

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:44.956
I'll meet you at your mother's house.
Your mother's house in Danville.

01:31:45.082 --> 01:31:48.168
That's a good idea.
Okay, now if I don't come back,

01:31:48.252 --> 01:31:51.630
you leave by yourself
and you go to your mother's house.

01:31:51.714 --> 01:31:54.466
You take care of yourself, hmm.

01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:57.052
Be quiet and don't move.

01:31:57.136 --> 01:32:00.347
That goes for both of you.

01:32:00.431 --> 01:32:02.390
I love you, Judy.

01:32:02.475 --> 01:32:04.684
- What?
- I love you.

01:32:04.769 --> 01:32:06.061
David, I can't hear you.

01:32:07.813 --> 01:32:11.191
David, I can't hear you.
[Crying]

01:32:11.275 --> 01:32:13.735
I love you.

01:32:22.745 --> 01:32:26.998
David, what are
we gonna call our baby?

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:29.334
[Laughs]

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:34.256
I think it's a boy.

01:32:39.345 --> 01:32:41.555
It'd like a boy.

01:32:41.639 --> 01:32:45.976
Our baby, David.

[Chattering Continues]

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:10.166
You gotta go around
and look on the other side. Move it!

01:33:21.554 --> 01:33:25.140
I see your lights. All right.
Give us an aerial flare.

01:33:26.475 --> 01:33:31.062
We gotta knock those blocks down.
Good place to hide among those blocks.

[Men Chattering]

01:33:36.068 --> 01:33:40.071
- Give a look into one of those things.
- [Chattering Continues]

Somebody check out the building.
Two men, check out the building.

01:33:47.371 --> 01:33:49.706
Gotta work in pairs.

01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:53.376

Come on. Let's get out of here.
- Better check up in the tower here.

01:34:16.484 --> 01:34:21.071
- Watch out for crazies!
There's crazies in there.
- Shut up.

01:34:22.031 --> 01:34:24.449
- What's up? You see something?
- I don't know.

01:34:29.038 --> 01:34:30.747
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:42.258
- Hey, man, what the hell are you doing?
- Hold on. I'm coming.

Hey, you all right?

01:34:49.934 --> 01:34:54.062
Hey! Hey, what's the matter, buddy?

01:34:54.146 --> 01:34:55.772
Nothin'. I'm comin' down.

01:34:55.856 --> 01:34:59.192
Hey, man, it's scary enough around here.
Why didn't you answer me?

01:34:59.276 --> 01:35:01.861
I'll be right there!
I'm takin' a piss!

01:35:01.946 --> 01:35:05.156
Aw, kiss my ass.
Takin' a piss.

01:35:07.159 --> 01:35:09.994
What the hell does that mean,
"takin' a piss"?

01:35:13.165 --> 01:35:18.253
Hey, uh, how far out
from Cairo?

01:35:18.337 --> 01:35:19.754
[David]
Don't know.

01:35:26.011 --> 01:35:28.930
- [Laughs]
- Hey, come on.
It's spooky around here.

01:35:31.684 --> 01:35:34.018
We'll never find the other guys
if we don't leave now. Come on.

01:35:34.145 --> 01:35:37.147
[David]
All right, I'm comin' down!
[Laughs]

01:35:40.985 --> 01:35:44.070
Okay!
Hold it. Be quiet.

01:35:44.196 --> 01:35:47.532
Oh, David.
There's something in there.
Sounds like a little kid.

No! No!

It's all right!
It's all right, Judy.
No! No!

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:27.489
Stop! Hey, stop shooting!
We're not army!

01:36:27.573 --> 01:36:30.784
- [Gunfire Continues]
- Please! We're not-

01:36:30.868 --> 01:36:32.619
[Gunfire Continues]

01:36:32.703 --> 01:36:34.746
[Moans]

01:36:48.177 --> 01:36:51.095
Hey, Coach.
I didn't know it was you.

01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:03.775
[Grunts]

01:37:09.406 --> 01:37:13.243
- Hey, Coach, who's she?
- Baby.

01:37:13.327 --> 01:37:16.246
David, it hurts.
[Crying]

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.918
I know, baby. I know.

01:37:25.798 --> 01:37:27.465
[Moans]

01:37:29.635 --> 01:37:36.641
He's kicking.

01:37:38.435 --> 01:37:43.439
No. He’s just sleeping.

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:47.193
All right, boy, let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

01:37:47.278 --> 01:37:51.364
Oh, hurry. You decide
what you want to name him.

01:37:54.326 --> 01:37:55.994
[Moans]

01:37:57.079 --> 01:37:58.788
I think-

01:38:01.166 --> 01:38:04.085
I think we'd better
call him David.

01:38:08.757 --> 01:38:14.178
Judy?

01:38:14.263 --> 01:38:18.641
[Peckem's Voice]
Right on the money as far
as the, uh, census info is concerned.

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:21.811
3,613 total population.

01:38:25.608 --> 01:38:27.984
Twenty-
Twenty-one hundred survivors.

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:31.321
If you want to call them survivors.

01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:35.033
[Brubaker]
Uh, I read you, Chris.
That's a fine job.

01:38:35.117 --> 01:38:40.079
I hate to drop this on you,
but, uh, Chris, we're taking you out.

01:38:40.164 --> 01:38:42.332
We're sending you into Louisville.
Louisville?

01:38:42.416 --> 01:38:46.210
Now we don't want
to hit the panic button, Chris,
but we have reports of symptoms.

01:38:46.337 --> 01:38:51.341
We've always considered
the possibility of Trixie being carried out
before you got your lines up.

01:38:52.551 --> 01:38:56.137
[Mutters]
We doubt it, frankly,
Chris, but, uh,

01:38:56.221 --> 01:39:00.767
we want you in there
to check the situation over
just in case.

01:39:00.851 --> 01:39:04.687
If it does break out,
you'll be much better prepared, Chris.

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:08.274
[Chuckles]
You, uh- You have one
under your belt now.

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:11.778
Yes, sir.
You're the only one
to send in there.

01:39:11.862 --> 01:39:15.949
The state police
have blocked the roads
and closed the airports.

01:39:16.033 --> 01:39:19.786
You're doing a great job.
Hang in there.

01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:22.622
You've got transport arranged.

01:39:22.706 --> 01:39:26.376
You'll have to go through
the medical before you leave
the area.

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:29.545
We don't want you
carrying Trixie out.

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:31.714
No, sir.

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:36.052
[Chattering, Shouting]

01:39:38.263 --> 01:39:40.807
Put your hands on your head,
Colonel, please.

01:39:40.891 --> 01:39:44.227
Breathe through your mouth.

01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:50.358
[People Continue Chattering,
Shouting]

01:39:58.909 --> 01:40:00.952
Colonel Peckem, sir,
we can sign you out.

01:40:02.079 --> 01:40:04.664
Hear anything from Dietrich?
They're sending in a new man
from Trixie.

01:40:04.748 --> 01:40:06.666
He should be here tomorrow.

01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:09.460
If we only knew what
Watts was working on.

01:40:09.545 --> 01:40:14.173
Our boys have checked the slides
he left in his microscope, but we can't
make heads nor tails out of it.

01:40:14.258 --> 01:40:18.428
He was onto something.
We'll dope it out...
sooner or later.

01:40:18.512 --> 01:40:20.513
[Scoffs]
Sooner or later.

01:40:20.597 --> 01:40:24.809
Understand they found
a rhesus monkey at Dietrich- immune.

01:40:24.893 --> 01:40:26.936
Sooner or later, we'll find a human.

01:40:29.815 --> 01:40:31.816
Sooner or later.

01:40:35.404 --> 01:40:38.448
- Want an immunity check
on this one, Doctor?
- Are you kidding me, soldier?

01:40:39.908 --> 01:40:42.869
[Man's Voice]
I see no way out of this.

01:40:42.953 --> 01:40:46.372
There's never been-
There's never been a Trixie before.

01:40:46.457 --> 01:40:48.666
In admission, there's nothing about it.

01:40:48.792 --> 01:40:51.711
And I'm concerned- damn concerned.
I don't know what you have-
How you feel about it.

01:40:51.837 --> 01:40:56.966
[Man #2] I simply said repeatedly-
Accusations and blame
are not gonna help anything.

01:40:57.051 --> 01:41:01.763
[Voices Continue Indistinctly]

01:41:08.896 --> 01:41:11.898
[Helicopter Blades Whirring]

01:41:19.156 --> 01:41:22.033
[Woman]
# Heaven, help us #

01:41:22.117 --> 01:41:28.331
# Firelight, won't you let me be #

01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:32.794
# I feel so helpless #

01:41:32.878 --> 01:41:39.675
# How can I find the morning #

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:43.763
# Daytime heroes #

01:41:43.847 --> 01:41:49.685
# Save me a piece of sunshine sky #

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:54.065
# A safer place where I #

01:41:54.149 --> 01:42:01.656
# Can get up and find the morning #

01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:05.326
# If time is a healer#

01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:07.453
# Then why are we wounded #

01:42:07.538 --> 01:42:12.416
# And why are those people dying #

01:42:12.501 --> 01:42:15.378
# And I get so weary #

01:42:15.462 --> 01:42:17.922
# In moments of sadness #

01:42:18.006 --> 01:42:23.136
# I can't even hear people crying #

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:27.515
# But I know they do #

01:42:27.599 --> 01:42:31.561
# Marching soldier #

01:42:31.645 --> 01:42:37.650
# Fighting behind a losing cause #

01:42:37.734 --> 01:42:42.321
# A better war is yours #

01:42:42.406 --> 01:42:47.160
# If you can find #

01:42:47.244 --> 01:42:50.663
# The morning #

01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:55.418
# Heaven help us #

01:42:57.254 --> 01:43:00.423
# Heaven help us ##
