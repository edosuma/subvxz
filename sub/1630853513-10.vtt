00:00.046 --> 00:01.875
Previously on Roswell, New Mexico...

00:01.898 --> 00:03.426
My mother said that this necklace

00:03.451 --> 00:05.005
protects my family from evil.

00:05.030 --> 00:06.279
MICHAEL: There's only one flower

00:06.304 --> 00:07.474
in Maria's necklace.

00:07.499 --> 00:09.318
But there are two DeLuca
women, and apparently

00:09.343 --> 00:11.295
the flower is the key to
preventing their illness.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.403
You guys remember that
recurring dream I used to have

00:13.428 --> 00:14.490
about being chained up?

00:14.515 --> 00:15.841
I was starting to think that maybe

00:15.866 --> 00:17.411
it was more than just a night terror.

00:17.436 --> 00:18.950
Maybe it's a memory

00:18.975 --> 00:20.764
from before we came out of the pods.

00:20.789 --> 00:23.583
- You're my world, Louise.
- I am so sorry.

00:23.608 --> 00:26.091
- That's her. That's my mom.
- "Thank you, Tripp."

00:26.116 --> 00:27.389
He wasn't hunting them.

00:27.414 --> 00:28.780
He was trying to help them.

00:28.805 --> 00:31.178
I know where we need to go next.

00:39.199 --> 00:40.990
She took a bullet to the spine.

00:41.015 --> 00:42.866
I-I did what I could with what I had,

00:42.891 --> 00:44.162
but I had to hide her.

00:44.187 --> 00:46.550
Tripp, give them room, they're doctors.

00:51.069 --> 00:53.342
Your message said that you
were gonna bring two women

00:53.367 --> 00:55.584
that would be no trouble. This

00:55.609 --> 00:57.003
looks like a lot of trouble.

00:57.927 --> 00:59.854
I must have gotten the codes wrong.

01:00.098 --> 01:02.215
No, don't give me that
"Manes man" nonsense.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.284
- Not here in my own home.
- Her name is Louise.

01:04.309 --> 01:07.175
I promised her friend
Nora I'd protect them.

01:07.617 --> 01:10.199
My brother triggered an ambush
before I could get them here.

01:10.224 --> 01:11.784
- (LOUISE GROANS)
- And Nora...

01:11.809 --> 01:13.701
Wait, what does the Air
Force want them for?

01:13.726 --> 01:15.245
(LOUISE GROANING)

01:15.270 --> 01:16.992
They're not from around here.

01:17.017 --> 01:18.748
They're from...

01:18.773 --> 01:20.459
up north.

01:20.484 --> 01:23.629
Yíiyáh. No, she can't stay here.

01:23.654 --> 01:24.902
Harrison... No.

01:25.123 --> 01:26.624
What if your brother comes here

01:26.649 --> 01:28.629
and finds a fugitive? I
can't put my people at risk

01:28.654 --> 01:30.011
- for a white woman.
- Please.

01:30.036 --> 01:31.886
You're the only person I trust.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.474
If she doesn't make it,
it was all for nothing.

01:34.499 --> 01:36.527
I'll have you remember
that I was the one

01:36.552 --> 01:38.331
that saved your ass in Okinawa.

01:38.356 --> 01:40.269
I don't owe you anything.

01:44.387 --> 01:47.443
I'm only doing this
because you're my family.

01:47.468 --> 01:49.517
- (LOUISE GROANS)
- And because I'm a damn fool.

01:49.542 --> 01:51.865

01:59.273 --> 02:00.560
Shh. Don't speak.

02:00.585 --> 02:02.968
Oh, my God. Liz, what are you doing?

02:06.237 --> 02:08.305
Oh, that's cold.

02:10.181 --> 02:12.326
Your heartbeat is irregular.

02:12.351 --> 02:13.639
You been getting enough rest?

02:13.664 --> 02:15.124
Have you?

02:15.302 --> 02:16.787
I didn't hear you come in last night.

02:16.812 --> 02:18.022
Kind of missed you.

02:18.047 --> 02:20.334
(CHUCKLES) I worked late.

02:20.359 --> 02:21.480
Oh, no, none of that.

02:21.505 --> 02:23.321
- Come on.
- Isobel is almost here

02:23.346 --> 02:25.147
to meet you for your road trip.

02:25.172 --> 02:26.233
And I would like

02:26.258 --> 02:27.553
- to have pants on.
- (GROANS)

02:27.578 --> 02:29.209
I'm excited about this, though.

02:29.234 --> 02:31.701
You know Alex dug up all
that info on our bio mom.

02:31.726 --> 02:32.834
You sure you can't come?

02:32.859 --> 02:34.874
Got to take my dad in
for his blood tests.

02:34.899 --> 02:36.225
I want to check on Jenna, too.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.397
Cannot believe she's back
in the hospital again.

02:38.422 --> 02:40.139
Ah, she's been in pain for weeks.

02:40.164 --> 02:42.006
I have no leads on the
mysterious hunting van,

02:42.031 --> 02:44.555
- and Charlie hasn't made contact.
- Hmm.

02:44.580 --> 02:47.272
To be fair, I do hear that phone service

02:47.297 --> 02:49.998
is a little spotty in flying saucers.

02:50.023 --> 02:52.826
- (CHUCKLES) Okay, I get that.
- (CHUCKLING)

02:52.851 --> 02:55.228
You think my alien
abduction theory is bogus.

02:55.253 --> 02:57.873
I know you're worried that
this has to do with you.

02:57.898 --> 03:00.400
But I don't think this
is an alien thing.

03:00.425 --> 03:02.818
Cam and I had fractal
burns on our necks.

03:02.843 --> 03:04.256
We had no memory of what happened.

03:04.281 --> 03:05.906
That's alien stuff.

03:06.171 --> 03:08.381
I just want clarity on something.

03:08.406 --> 03:11.248
- (DOOR OPENS)
- ISOBEL: Hello?

03:11.273 --> 03:13.287
Do you guys have pants on?

03:14.650 --> 03:18.459
In conclusion, esteemed members
of the Roswell Tourism Board,

03:18.484 --> 03:21.443
while the Pony is normally
a sanctuary for locals

03:21.468 --> 03:22.623
during CrashCon,

03:22.648 --> 03:24.662
I think that my plan to turn it into

03:24.687 --> 03:28.886
the Contact Cantina Pop-Up Bar
will be a hit with alien fans.

03:28.911 --> 03:31.428
We're talking more money
than we first speculated,

03:31.453 --> 03:33.295
- aren't we, now?
- You know, Mayor Bernhardt,

03:33.320 --> 03:35.851
I forgot to tell you about
our new morning cocktail.

03:35.876 --> 03:37.163
Ooh. It's coffee,

03:37.188 --> 03:39.439
vanilla cream, and our best bourbon.

03:40.257 --> 03:42.150
Let me get you a double.

03:44.330 --> 03:46.446
You have to let me go.

03:46.471 --> 03:47.828
You're just crazy!

03:47.853 --> 03:49.448
And I'm trapped...

03:49.473 --> 03:51.016
(SCREAMS)

03:51.041 --> 03:52.951
(PANTING)

03:53.182 --> 03:55.992
(CHUCKLES) I thought I saw a spider.

03:56.017 --> 03:57.331
(CLEARS THROAT)

03:57.356 --> 03:58.816
(CHUCKLES)

03:59.070 --> 04:02.463
I had a vision, but it was,
it was more like a memory.

04:02.488 --> 04:04.898
Of a fight I had with my
mom when I was younger.

04:04.923 --> 04:06.554
Maybe we should get that necklace back

04:06.579 --> 04:07.749
- from Rosa.
- It's fine.

04:07.774 --> 04:09.585
The vision didn't even
interrupt my pitch

04:09.610 --> 04:12.070
too badly. I just distracted
the mayor with booze.

04:12.095 --> 04:14.765
And now... to celebrate.

04:15.062 --> 04:18.093
- Ooh.
- You cannot distract me

04:18.118 --> 04:19.247
- with sex.
- No?

04:19.272 --> 04:21.202
I want to talk about the
freaky flashback vision.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.640
Mm-mm.

04:23.151 --> 04:25.038
Oh, God, fine.

04:25.063 --> 04:28.023
Oh, no talking. I hate talking.

04:28.048 --> 04:30.468
- Talking is the worst.
- Mm. That's my boy.

04:30.493 --> 04:32.218
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- ISOBEL: You have five seconds

04:32.243 --> 04:34.077
to leave room for Jesus.

04:34.102 --> 04:37.093
- (GROANS)
- Good... Wow.

04:37.859 --> 04:40.976
You know, I always assumed
Michael was a top, but...

04:41.001 --> 04:42.555
this actually makes a lot of sense.

04:42.596 --> 04:43.657
What are you doing here?

04:43.682 --> 04:44.975
Pack your bags.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.875
- We're going on a family road trip.
- Oh, God.

04:46.900 --> 04:47.922
I'm calling shotgun.

04:47.947 --> 04:49.679
You can't call shotgun if
you don't see the car.

04:49.704 --> 04:50.882
That's a basic rule and you know it.

04:50.907 --> 04:52.477
Is this why Max wanted the day off?

04:52.502 --> 04:54.407
In the photo of Max
and Isobel's bio mom,

04:54.432 --> 04:55.484
there was a water tower.

04:55.509 --> 04:56.961
Alex recognized that water tower

04:56.986 --> 04:59.143
from the town where his mom grew up.

04:59.785 --> 05:01.078
You should come with us.

05:01.103 --> 05:02.868
If she's coming, I get shotgun.

05:02.893 --> 05:04.523
You can't call until we see the car.

05:04.548 --> 05:06.608
Oh, it's made-up rules, DeLuca.

05:07.397 --> 05:09.228
Pickup order for Manes.

05:09.253 --> 05:11.698
I hope that limp isn't
from a paintball injury.

05:11.723 --> 05:13.407
(CHUCKLES)

05:13.432 --> 05:16.370
Nope. Those, uh, bruises
have mostly healed.

05:16.696 --> 05:18.554
I just got a new prosthetic.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.497
Takes a minute to get used to.

05:21.885 --> 05:23.428
You working on your book?

05:23.956 --> 05:26.128
I write my book on my computer.

05:26.153 --> 05:29.235
However, I write my angsty emo poetry

05:29.260 --> 05:31.975
- in an angsty emo journal.
- (CHUCKLES)

05:32.000 --> 05:34.002
I'm actually working
on some poetry myself.

05:34.027 --> 05:36.279
Well, song lyrics, technically.

05:36.304 --> 05:38.140
It's a lot harder than
it was in high school.

05:38.165 --> 05:40.618
Yeah, writing was easier for
me when I was a kid, too.

05:40.643 --> 05:42.602
Feelings... we bury 'em now.

05:42.627 --> 05:44.383
You just got to find
that thing inside of you

05:44.408 --> 05:45.827
that doesn't have a voice.

05:45.852 --> 05:47.353
Lend it yours. You know?

05:47.378 --> 05:50.383
Listen... I have, like,
zero musical talent,

05:50.408 --> 05:52.860
but if you need help with the
wordy part, we could, uh...

05:52.885 --> 05:54.498
Actually, I'm leaving
tomorrow for a few days

05:54.523 --> 05:55.789
to go talk to some recruits.

05:55.814 --> 05:56.911
MICHAEL: Alex, they make you pick

05:56.936 --> 05:58.595
the beans or what?

05:58.620 --> 06:00.779
ALEX: I thought that you
were waiting in the car.

06:00.804 --> 06:03.071
Isobel and Maria needed a
time-out from each other.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.494
She started it.

06:05.663 --> 06:07.003
Hey, Forrest.

06:07.028 --> 06:08.850
You guys off to do some
more alien research?

06:08.875 --> 06:10.282
Uh, no, we're going on a road trip

06:10.307 --> 06:12.226
to the reservation where my mom grew up.

06:12.267 --> 06:13.643
ISOBEL: I just took a DNA test,

06:13.668 --> 06:16.721
turns out I'm Elizabeth
Warren percent Navajo.

06:17.516 --> 06:19.006
Is this your girlfriend?

06:19.031 --> 06:21.063
- Uh...
- Oh, my God.

06:21.088 --> 06:22.884
- Gross.
- Is that how I present?

06:23.386 --> 06:25.221
It was good to see you, Forrest.

06:25.246 --> 06:26.375
Yeah. You, too.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.649
Hey, I'll be at the Pony tonight
if you're back in time.

06:28.674 --> 06:30.102
You know, we could work on your song

06:30.127 --> 06:31.641
before you leave for your recruitment.

06:31.666 --> 06:34.235
♪ Till the sky turns blue... ♪

06:34.260 --> 06:35.470
See you.

06:38.645 --> 06:41.329
(WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER P.A.)

06:44.289 --> 06:47.297
I thought you might want "hair so shiny,

06:47.322 --> 06:48.789
it's gonna make your guy cry."

06:48.814 --> 06:51.500
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)
- What, what are you doing here?

06:51.525 --> 06:53.747
Oh, my dad's in the waiting room.

06:53.772 --> 06:55.743
We're a little early
for his appointment.

06:55.768 --> 06:57.851
- How you feeling?
- Well, aside from

06:57.876 --> 07:00.758
debilitating migraines
keeping me bedridden,

07:00.783 --> 07:02.859
- I'm super.
- Max thinks that,

07:02.884 --> 07:05.477
'cause of the burns, it's
maybe an alien thing.

07:05.502 --> 07:06.712
"Max thinks."

07:06.833 --> 07:09.893
So typical of a dude
to make my abduction

07:09.918 --> 07:11.357
all about him.

07:11.382 --> 07:14.210
I just believe it was
someone trying to use me

07:14.235 --> 07:15.445
to get to Charlie.

07:15.470 --> 07:18.390
What she's tangled up in is bad,

07:18.415 --> 07:21.077
but probably not aliens.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.414
Wish I could convince Max.

07:24.439 --> 07:27.812
Stress isn't good for him.

07:27.837 --> 07:30.495
MAN: I'm not gonna argue with you.
I need access to this room now.

07:30.520 --> 07:33.062
You can't take enforcement
action in a sensitive location.

07:33.087 --> 07:36.358
Ma'am, I'm looking for potential
witnesses to human smuggling.

07:37.782 --> 07:40.764
If you don't have a warrant,
you're not coming in this room.

07:40.789 --> 07:42.733
DR. GRIFFIN: This young
man is a patient.

07:42.758 --> 07:44.031
He's waiting for an X-ray.

07:44.056 --> 07:45.812
You can't remove him from the hospital.

07:45.837 --> 07:47.441
MIGUEL: Abuela, I told you,
we shouldn't have come here.

07:47.466 --> 07:50.101
Miguel, don't say anything.
You understand?

07:50.126 --> 07:53.164
- Not a word.
- Mija, I got you a coffee.

07:53.189 --> 07:56.195
(SIGHS) Papi, we have to
go, come on, right now.

07:56.220 --> 07:58.196
Can I see some ID, please?

08:03.514 --> 08:06.336
He has applied for his green card.
I'm his sponsor, okay?

08:06.361 --> 08:08.539
This is his, uh, G-1145 right here.

08:08.564 --> 08:09.860
You can show that to the court.

08:09.885 --> 08:11.844
- No, hey-hey-hey...
- ARTURO: It's okay. Call the lawyer.

08:11.869 --> 08:13.289
No. No-no-no. He is a diabetic.

08:13.314 --> 08:15.233
It is illegal to detain a patient.

08:15.258 --> 08:17.260
- Exigent circumstances.
- Move.

08:17.285 --> 08:19.016
No. Hey, this is an
unconstitutional arrest,

08:19.041 --> 08:20.524
and the ACLU will be all over you.

08:20.549 --> 08:23.885
Elizabeth, we respect
the law in this family.

08:23.910 --> 08:25.360
If you're in trouble,

08:25.385 --> 08:27.429
who will take care of the mouse?

08:32.087 --> 08:34.061
Wait. Hold on. He left his jacket.

08:34.086 --> 08:36.104
No, hey, it's cold out there.

08:36.129 --> 08:38.157
He is not even wearing a sweater.

08:41.001 --> 08:43.532
ISOBEL: Rules are
rules, fair and square.

08:43.557 --> 08:46.571
And, anyway, I shouldn't have
to call shotgun, Michael,

08:46.596 --> 08:48.524
it's my car. I get eternal shotgun.

08:48.549 --> 08:50.172
(SIGHS) It wouldn't have been so bad

08:50.197 --> 08:51.360
if you weren't made of elbows.

08:51.385 --> 08:55.337
At the risk of sounding
un-PC, uh, may I propose

08:55.415 --> 08:57.906
- a peace treaty?
- ISOBEL AND MARIA: No.

08:57.931 --> 08:59.384
GREGORY: Hey.

08:59.409 --> 09:02.673
We can smoke the peace
pipe after the rain dance.

09:02.698 --> 09:04.595
It's good to see you, Alex.

09:04.620 --> 09:06.196
Guys, this is my brother Gregory.

09:06.221 --> 09:08.306
- Gregory...
- High school wasn't that long ago.

09:08.331 --> 09:09.986
- I know everyone.
- Hi.

09:10.011 --> 09:11.063
Are you all here about

09:11.088 --> 09:12.110
the woman in the photo?

09:12.135 --> 09:13.806
Uh, just Michael, Isobel and Max.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.680
Maria and I are going
to the trading post.

09:15.705 --> 09:18.064
And the jewelry is calling my name.

09:20.223 --> 09:22.859
So... where do we start?

09:22.884 --> 09:24.486
We start at the end.

09:26.112 --> 09:28.699
I know there's no service up there,

09:28.724 --> 09:30.434
but call me when you can.

09:30.459 --> 09:32.203
I love you.

09:33.556 --> 09:36.541
Okay. So the deputy on call

09:36.566 --> 09:38.769
says there's one detention
center in the county.

09:38.794 --> 09:41.588
- Here's the info.
- (EXHALES) He, he doesn't

09:41.755 --> 09:43.890
have anything left in Mexico.

09:43.915 --> 09:45.015
No one. Nowhere to go.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.655
You can't think like that right now.

09:46.712 --> 09:49.265
I think like this always.

09:49.412 --> 09:52.265
Rosa and I used to
recite our escape plan

09:52.290 --> 09:54.058
for if our parents got deported

09:54.083 --> 09:56.102
and we got separated in foster care.

09:56.127 --> 09:57.555
I begged my parents

09:57.580 --> 09:58.957
not to tell Santa where we lived

09:58.982 --> 10:01.593
because I was afraid
he'd ask for papers.

10:01.618 --> 10:04.902
My whole life was built on
a fear of this day coming,

10:04.927 --> 10:06.529
and it's here.

10:12.527 --> 10:14.874
If I'd have kept better
track of his health,

10:14.899 --> 10:16.593
he wouldn't need these tests.

10:16.618 --> 10:18.749
I should have made him
move to California.

10:18.774 --> 10:20.163
Yeah, I thought we were safe

10:20.188 --> 10:23.378
being outside the hundred-mile
zone, but after this election...

10:24.760 --> 10:26.506
I should've known better.

10:26.687 --> 10:28.796
And I should've made him
wear a sweater this morning

10:28.821 --> 10:31.069
because it's freezing out there.
And what if he...?

10:31.094 --> 10:33.397
Liz, stop. Breathe, breathe. Okay?

10:33.422 --> 10:34.991
If you don't breathe,
you're gonna work yourself

10:35.016 --> 10:37.484
- into a panic attack. Just...
- Okay. Okay.

10:37.816 --> 10:39.229
Think.

10:40.439 --> 10:42.439
Is there someone we can call?

10:42.631 --> 10:46.248
Kyle's at a conference, but I
can have him call his mom.

10:46.273 --> 10:49.608
Do you know anyone with some real power?

10:49.633 --> 10:51.532
You know, federal muscle.

10:51.557 --> 10:53.950
Gonna have to call my BFF Ivanka.

10:54.266 --> 10:56.411
Yeah.

10:56.436 --> 10:57.830
Okay.

10:57.945 --> 10:59.403
I'm gonna get dressed.

10:59.428 --> 11:01.228
And we're gonna go to
the detention center.

11:01.253 --> 11:03.343
Oh, no, no, no. You do
not need to do that.

11:03.368 --> 11:04.859
You are in pain.

11:07.468 --> 11:11.092
You've had 28 years of running scared.

11:11.117 --> 11:12.910
I can handle a headache,

11:12.935 --> 11:15.431
at least until Evans gets back, okay?

11:22.448 --> 11:24.105
(KEYS CLICKING)

11:25.127 --> 11:27.443
(LINE RINGING)

11:30.248 --> 11:32.406
Hey, it's me.

11:33.166 --> 11:35.201
Liz.

11:36.026 --> 11:37.827
I need your help.

11:38.620 --> 11:40.366
GREGORY: You're still the Isobel Evans

11:40.391 --> 11:42.757
who convinced the basketball
captain to pull four different

11:42.782 --> 11:45.101
fire alarms to get out of AP Gov, right?

11:45.126 --> 11:46.250
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

11:46.275 --> 11:48.214
Yeah. Legend.

11:49.107 --> 11:50.591
Here she is.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.454
ISOBEL: Oh, my God.

11:56.930 --> 11:59.140
It's covered in flowers.

11:59.794 --> 12:01.226
It's winter.

12:01.251 --> 12:03.628
Rumor is, they grow
year-round unattended.

12:03.653 --> 12:05.022
She was a healer.

12:05.047 --> 12:06.981
I-I'm told she helped with trauma,

12:07.006 --> 12:08.776
addiction, that sort of thing.

12:09.450 --> 12:11.361
All without speaking, yes.

12:12.161 --> 12:14.155
This another grave?

12:17.558 --> 12:19.602
Think of the child. Go. Go.

12:19.627 --> 12:21.503
(GUNSHOT) NORA: No!

12:21.528 --> 12:23.039
She was pregnant?

12:23.064 --> 12:24.899
Louise arrived gravely injured.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.044
And the baby didn't survive.

12:27.111 --> 12:30.172
Uh... (SIGHS)

12:30.197 --> 12:31.532
ISOBEL: No.

12:31.557 --> 12:34.134
I'll meet you back at the car.

12:53.421 --> 12:56.226
Are you okay? Seem a little off.

12:56.251 --> 12:59.241
(SIGHS) I had a vision during
a meeting this morning.

12:59.266 --> 13:02.454
It almost cost me a deal
that could save the bar.

13:03.617 --> 13:06.036
Maybe I should just wear the necklace.

13:06.442 --> 13:09.663
Go back to being a social
media guru-slash-barkeep...

13:09.879 --> 13:14.085
slash-magical trope in our
redneck mayor's fantasy.

13:14.110 --> 13:16.301
So, why did you really come today?

13:16.827 --> 13:19.530
Your ideal day off isn't
fighting for the radio dial

13:19.555 --> 13:21.599
with Isobel Evans, so...

13:24.174 --> 13:26.233
This is the back of my necklace.

13:26.398 --> 13:29.064
The word stamped in the
silver says "Tsela."

13:29.089 --> 13:31.280
The necklace is Navajo, so
I thought maybe that was

13:31.305 --> 13:33.235
the jeweler, but no one I've asked here

13:33.260 --> 13:34.779
seems to know who made it.

13:34.804 --> 13:36.989
I just want answers.

13:38.678 --> 13:41.660
Well, there's a ton of silver
jewelry for sale here.

13:41.685 --> 13:43.487
So why don't we just keep
looking for something

13:43.512 --> 13:44.846
with the same stamp?

13:44.871 --> 13:46.457
Okay?

13:49.241 --> 13:51.753
MICHAEL: Noah said our
planet was war-torn.

13:52.007 --> 13:54.859
But the hell they found here
can't have been worth it.

13:59.796 --> 14:01.763
ISOBEL: Do you think that

14:01.996 --> 14:05.142
Louise's baby died from
her injuries or...

14:05.397 --> 14:07.689
you think maybe it was
never gonna survive?

14:07.714 --> 14:09.883
What are you talking about?

14:11.940 --> 14:14.151
(SIGHS)

14:17.149 --> 14:21.367
I was pregnant... when you died.

14:21.846 --> 14:24.307
Obviously, I'm not anymore.

14:24.752 --> 14:28.164
I just can't help wondering
if that was my last chance.

14:29.177 --> 14:32.388
Assuming that humans and
aliens can't procreate,

14:32.413 --> 14:34.504
because they're different species.

14:35.790 --> 14:38.716
Maybe that little baby wasn't viable.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.429
You almost died during the
abortion, didn't you?

14:42.917 --> 14:45.432
(SCOFFS) I could feel it.

14:46.211 --> 14:48.769
Noah almost killed you again, huh?

14:49.188 --> 14:51.688
Oh, I need a minute.

14:54.376 --> 14:57.527
Well, that went well. (LAUGHS SOFTLY)

14:58.174 --> 15:00.260
Noah wasn't your only chance.

15:01.552 --> 15:04.117
We could do the turkey baster thing.

15:04.413 --> 15:05.864
Whatever.

15:05.889 --> 15:07.307
You know?

15:07.332 --> 15:09.165
Sorry, um...

15:09.793 --> 15:12.796
I'm gonna need you to say more words.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.087
If you want a kid,

15:15.780 --> 15:19.601
I will raise the white walker,
I will play the pink guitar.

15:19.626 --> 15:20.843
Okay, stop.

15:21.847 --> 15:24.179
Are you telling me that you would...

15:24.740 --> 15:28.452
donate your alien baby gravy?

15:29.194 --> 15:31.519
I'm saying that I want a family.

15:31.604 --> 15:34.315
So if you want to be a mom someday...

15:34.770 --> 15:36.858
and you need an alien dad...

15:39.734 --> 15:44.054
Look, I know you would rather
have a white picket fence

15:44.079 --> 15:47.702
and a, and a golden retriever
and a husband, but you're...

15:50.448 --> 15:55.127
You would be an incredible father.

15:57.918 --> 16:00.924
Have I told you lately that I love you?

16:03.601 --> 16:06.262
(LAUGHS)

16:09.117 --> 16:11.267
I wish you had never said "baby gravy."

16:11.292 --> 16:13.770
(LAUGHS)

16:14.296 --> 16:17.498
It's Ortecho. Arturo
Ortecho, he's my dad.

16:17.532 --> 16:19.226
And he needs gliclazide
and beta-blockers.

16:19.251 --> 16:20.272
I brought both.

16:20.297 --> 16:21.799
We can't take contraband here,

16:21.824 --> 16:24.451
but there is an infirmary
on-site, if he's here.

16:24.476 --> 16:25.960
You know, out of curiosity,

16:25.985 --> 16:28.171
did Nebane Abienwi visit an infirmary

16:28.196 --> 16:31.032
before he died of a brain
bleed in your custody?

16:31.057 --> 16:32.493
What about Johana Medina León?

16:32.518 --> 16:34.036
She was 25 years old, okay?

16:34.061 --> 16:36.579
People walk through those
doors and they die.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.560
That's enough, lady. We get it.

16:38.585 --> 16:39.844
Who's your supervisor?

16:39.869 --> 16:42.875
You need prior approval before
conducting enforcement in a hospital.

16:42.900 --> 16:45.136
- There was a compliance memo.
- Right, a memo,

16:45.161 --> 16:47.062
which is just like a law, except not.

16:47.087 --> 16:48.928
Unless you calm down,

16:48.953 --> 16:50.693
I'm gonna arrest you for obstruction.

16:50.718 --> 16:51.842
Okay, Liz, maybe sit down.

16:51.867 --> 16:54.057
Sir, I'm Deputy Jenna Cameron.

16:54.082 --> 16:55.685
And we appreciate your interpretations

16:55.710 --> 16:56.725
of your guidelines,

16:56.750 --> 16:58.428
but we have an urgent health concern

16:58.453 --> 16:59.955
about an inmate here, if you just

16:59.980 --> 17:02.231
wouldn't mind checking the system.

17:04.410 --> 17:05.943
All right.

17:09.252 --> 17:11.451
DOLI: Manes boys are
always welcome here.

17:11.476 --> 17:13.269
I'll fix you something to drink.

17:16.705 --> 17:18.374
GREGORY: He doesn't have much time left.

17:18.398 --> 17:19.747
Days, maybe.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.482
His name's Harrison.

17:21.890 --> 17:25.627
And he's the only one
Louise ever spoke to here.

17:28.749 --> 17:30.514
He met my dad's great-uncle

17:30.539 --> 17:32.490
Tripp Manes fighting in World War II.

17:32.638 --> 17:34.221
Harry was a code talker.

17:34.705 --> 17:36.160
Can we speak to him?

17:36.185 --> 17:38.558
I'm sorry. He's too far gone.

17:41.064 --> 17:44.310
Greg, you mind taking me
back to the trading post?

17:44.424 --> 17:46.718
I think I should check
on Alex and Maria.

17:46.924 --> 17:50.070
And seriously... Alex or Maria?

17:50.095 --> 17:51.664
You sure about this?

17:51.689 --> 17:53.364
(DOOR CLOSES)

17:53.438 --> 17:55.273
(MONITOR BEEPING)

18:05.424 --> 18:07.285
You look like her.

18:14.441 --> 18:16.144
Harrison.

18:16.169 --> 18:17.555
You look different.

18:17.580 --> 18:19.390
That was a lesson I learned from Louise.

18:19.527 --> 18:22.685
How to take your mind to a
better time when you're in pain.

18:22.710 --> 18:23.800
Come on,

18:23.833 --> 18:25.669
I haven't seen the sky in a while.

18:25.694 --> 18:27.441
I'll tell you about her.

18:30.554 --> 18:32.322
Hey! What did he say?

18:32.347 --> 18:35.406
Do you have a court case next
week for a vandalism charge?

18:35.431 --> 18:36.807
What?

18:36.832 --> 18:38.746
Y-Yes, but I didn't do it.

18:38.771 --> 18:41.683
I'm just gonna plead guilty and
pay the fine. It's nothing.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.855
They denied your dad's
green card application

18:43.880 --> 18:46.132
because of a misdemeanor on your record.

18:46.277 --> 18:48.127
You can't be his sponsor.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.596
- I want to see my father!
- Liz...

18:50.621 --> 18:52.542
- AGENT: We might be willing to help you
- Liz.

18:52.567 --> 18:54.611
- If you approached us more calmly.
- (GRUNTS)

18:54.636 --> 18:56.930
And what if I approached
you more blondely?

18:56.955 --> 18:58.371
Would that work?

18:58.396 --> 19:00.975
Because you seem very happy
talking to my friend, vato.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.559
- Liz...
- Jenna?

19:02.584 --> 19:03.836
(EXHALES)

19:03.861 --> 19:05.800
Hey! Are you okay?

19:05.825 --> 19:08.105
I'm sorry. It's my head.

19:08.130 --> 19:09.677
No, no, no. Okay.

19:09.702 --> 19:11.496
We can get out of here.

19:11.537 --> 19:13.247
Here. Just popped up.

19:13.272 --> 19:15.363
Ortecho's being transferred to El Paso

19:15.388 --> 19:16.956
for his deportation hearing.

19:16.981 --> 19:19.826
You can see him there around Tuesday.

19:20.755 --> 19:24.498
I taught Tripp the codes in the Pacific.

19:24.523 --> 19:26.583
That's how we set up the rescue.

19:26.805 --> 19:29.461
He was supposed to smuggle
Louise and Nora here,

19:29.486 --> 19:32.131
but the plan fell apart.

19:33.233 --> 19:35.067
Will you show us?

19:35.933 --> 19:37.677
It isn't pretty.

19:38.930 --> 19:40.605
You've changed.

19:41.765 --> 19:44.410
The man I met on that
ship obeyed orders.

19:44.824 --> 19:47.441
Guess I saw what happens
when good men fall in line

19:47.466 --> 19:49.167
with bad orders.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.414
I'm a Christian, Harry.

19:52.439 --> 19:54.945
When evil itself tells me
to kill a woman with child,

19:54.970 --> 19:56.449
I disobey.

19:56.474 --> 19:59.074
Even if the evil looks
just like my brother.

19:59.099 --> 20:01.326
(CHAIR ROLLING)

20:03.532 --> 20:05.998

20:13.821 --> 20:15.298

20:17.252 --> 20:19.222
Our sister survived.

20:22.097 --> 20:24.481
There should be music
where you take her.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.944
I think she's a dancer.

20:28.239 --> 20:30.946
You can give her a house
full of music, Louise.

20:31.333 --> 20:33.115
Nora wanted me to protect you,

20:33.140 --> 20:35.768
- so that you could protect the child.
- No.

20:35.793 --> 20:38.715
He's coming for me, and
I can't even move.

20:38.740 --> 20:42.064
No, when the devil comes, I
won't be able to fight for her.

20:42.949 --> 20:44.751
The devil?

20:44.846 --> 20:47.838
LOUISE: Please, it is hard to be a woman

20:47.863 --> 20:49.441
on your planet. It's only

20:49.466 --> 20:51.343
gonna be harder still for her.

20:51.489 --> 20:56.285
Roy Bronson believed in meeting
hatred with compassion.

20:57.317 --> 20:59.725
And I want her to be like him.

21:00.985 --> 21:03.221
A light in the darkness.

21:03.246 --> 21:05.356
A little star on the ground.

21:05.625 --> 21:08.359
I want that for both of my girls.

21:09.077 --> 21:10.546
Where did he take the baby?

21:10.571 --> 21:11.660
- Can't say.
- No.

21:11.685 --> 21:13.103
Tell us where our sister went.

21:13.128 --> 21:14.407
She isn't your sister.

21:14.432 --> 21:16.450
Louise rarely spoke, but when she did,

21:16.475 --> 21:18.101
she spoke of two daughters.

21:18.126 --> 21:20.112
Two stars on the ground.

21:21.403 --> 21:23.019
She had no sons.

21:23.044 --> 21:25.005
- No.
- (COUGHS)

21:25.928 --> 21:28.180
You, you aren't hers.

21:28.205 --> 21:30.050
You came from something else.

21:30.075 --> 21:31.621
- Something?
- Max, just calm down.

21:31.646 --> 21:34.510
- No, you said she barely spoke to you.
- Max, you're agitating him.

21:34.535 --> 21:36.160
ISOBEL: He's, like, a million years old.

21:36.185 --> 21:38.004
Harrison, I'm sorry. Uh, thank you.

21:38.029 --> 21:40.957
- But I think we need to leave now.
- No, wait.

21:42.148 --> 21:44.561
She lived for decades longer
than she should have,

21:44.783 --> 21:47.815
trapped inside of a body
that could no longer dance,

21:47.840 --> 21:50.277
waiting for a sign that
you would be all right.

21:50.302 --> 21:51.845
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

21:51.870 --> 21:53.403
She loved you.

21:53.428 --> 21:54.905
(STEADY BEEP)

21:54.930 --> 21:56.806
(REGULAR BEEPING)

21:56.831 --> 21:58.249
(GROANS SOFTLY)

21:58.274 --> 21:59.442
Max.

21:59.467 --> 22:00.816
It doesn't matter.

22:00.841 --> 22:02.413
Of course it matters.

22:06.683 --> 22:09.774
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER P.A.)

22:11.330 --> 22:13.131
(QUIETLY): Hi.

22:13.988 --> 22:17.094
- It's caffeine.
- (EXHALES)

22:17.119 --> 22:19.285
Are they out of Reposado?

22:19.310 --> 22:21.253
(CHUCKLES) It's gonna
make you feel better.

22:21.278 --> 22:22.918
- Mm, yeah.
- I asked them

22:22.943 --> 22:24.769
to run a new test.

22:24.794 --> 22:27.457
Your headaches are spinal headaches.

22:27.807 --> 22:29.406
Because there was a hole torn

22:29.431 --> 22:31.609
- into your spinal cord.
- I'm sorry, what?

22:31.634 --> 22:34.496
Uh, my kidnappers gave me a spinal tap?

22:34.521 --> 22:36.660
Do you mind signing off so I
can look at your tox screen?

22:36.685 --> 22:37.761
Yeah, of course, but, Liz,

22:37.786 --> 22:39.951
you d... you don't
have to do this, okay?

22:39.976 --> 22:42.192
- Your dad and...
- I need a distraction.

22:42.217 --> 22:43.802
I can't leave for El Paso

22:43.827 --> 22:45.988
until tomorrow, and they're
not letting him have visitors

22:46.013 --> 22:48.083
other than his lawyer
until Tuesday, so...

22:49.849 --> 22:52.087
Thank you for being here.

22:53.577 --> 22:58.636
No, you, you used your
privilege to help me.

22:58.661 --> 23:00.806
I'm furious that I needed it, but...

23:00.974 --> 23:02.601
I needed it.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.340
Any time.

23:05.985 --> 23:09.488
You've always been different
than me and Michael, okay?

23:09.513 --> 23:11.724
Always. You were the leader.

23:11.749 --> 23:14.224
From the start. I mean,
You're the special one.

23:14.249 --> 23:16.611
- You're the healer.
- I was.

23:16.636 --> 23:20.073
Now I can't even sneeze without
my heart skipping a beat.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.905
All my life, no matter how weird

23:22.930 --> 23:24.704
things got, I never felt alone.

23:24.729 --> 23:26.773
Because I was your twin.

23:26.798 --> 23:28.347
Maybe I'm different.

23:28.372 --> 23:30.696
Maybe I'm, maybe I'm a freak.

23:30.721 --> 23:32.337
What's this really about?

23:32.680 --> 23:34.548
I can't stop thinking about

23:35.374 --> 23:39.134
being chained up when I was a kid.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.993
It didn't feel like someone
bad chained me up.

23:42.018 --> 23:43.186
It felt like

23:43.211 --> 23:44.517
I was the someone bad.

23:44.542 --> 23:47.196
Max, you're not dangerous.

23:47.221 --> 23:49.812
Saving people destroys me.

23:49.837 --> 23:51.938
But killing Noah?

23:52.313 --> 23:54.025
That felt good.

23:54.050 --> 23:55.343
I was high.

23:55.561 --> 23:57.813
And whenever I think about
what he did to you,

23:57.838 --> 24:00.031
I want to chase that high.

24:00.335 --> 24:03.825
I wish I could kill
him a thousand times.

24:07.519 --> 24:09.915
Louise mentioned the devil.

24:09.940 --> 24:12.276
Maybe something evil was chasing them.

24:13.151 --> 24:15.963
And maybe that something was me.

24:18.228 --> 24:19.633
(SIGHS)

24:19.658 --> 24:21.451
Okay.

24:21.476 --> 24:23.970
(SNIFFLES) I want to show you something.

24:24.013 --> 24:27.016
You see this hand on her shoulder there?

24:27.509 --> 24:29.172
See, Michael thought it was just someone

24:29.197 --> 24:31.574
who got cropped out of
the picture, but no.

24:31.599 --> 24:34.519
Any female would recognize
that body language.

24:34.544 --> 24:37.067
She does not want that hand on her.

24:38.190 --> 24:40.445
Louise said the devil would come.

24:40.470 --> 24:42.139
Mm-hmm.

24:42.289 --> 24:44.658
I think something evil was after them,

24:45.282 --> 24:47.202
but it wasn't you.

24:48.811 --> 24:51.415
I want to find out who it was.

24:54.337 --> 24:56.441
Hey. (CLEARS THROAT)

24:56.466 --> 24:59.130
I just wanted to say
thank you before we go.

24:59.155 --> 25:00.638
I also feel like I should

25:00.663 --> 25:02.388
congratulate you on getting out.

25:02.413 --> 25:03.607
Of the Navy?

25:03.632 --> 25:05.341
Of the family.

25:05.837 --> 25:07.451
Getting out from under Dad.

25:08.016 --> 25:09.673
You got to break free of him, man.

25:09.698 --> 25:12.145
- Do you feel free?
- I, uh,

25:12.318 --> 25:15.334
don't think I get to be
free until you are, Alex.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.233
You know, you're my brother.

25:17.258 --> 25:21.613
I wish that I would've
stood up for you more.

25:24.551 --> 25:26.919
You know, I think he's actually
getting a little bit better.

25:26.944 --> 25:29.662
It's like the stroke
melted away the psycho

25:29.687 --> 25:31.600
in his brain or something.

25:32.030 --> 25:34.125
If you can forgive him, you should.

25:34.150 --> 25:36.211
Cast off the stone.

25:36.236 --> 25:38.196
Let me hate him for you.

25:38.221 --> 25:40.131
I owe you that much.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.793
You know, they say the
drive from here to Roswell

25:45.818 --> 25:47.430
isn't that bad.

25:47.455 --> 25:49.058
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

25:49.083 --> 25:50.892
Good to know.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.067
Liz.

26:01.092 --> 26:02.481
Hey, um, yeah, I'm sorry.

26:02.506 --> 26:04.184
- I'm just gonna go change, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

26:04.209 --> 26:06.628
ARTURO: I should fire you.
I'm gone one day,

26:06.653 --> 26:09.994
and already you're showing
up late for your shift?

26:10.019 --> 26:11.538
(EXHALES)

26:11.563 --> 26:14.250
(LAUGHS)

26:14.275 --> 26:16.084
(WHISPERS): Papi.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.062
How did you...?

26:20.087 --> 26:21.798
DIEGO: You called me.

26:23.318 --> 26:25.177
Hey, Elizabeth.

26:25.477 --> 26:27.261
Diego.

26:27.596 --> 26:31.554
ISOBEL: Great. Another
ostentatious belt buckle.

26:31.579 --> 26:33.158
You know, despite it all, you really are

26:33.183 --> 26:34.666
still my idiot brother.

26:34.691 --> 26:36.688
I'll always be your idiot brother.

26:37.459 --> 26:39.128
You guys have any luck?

26:39.153 --> 26:40.983
We had some luck.

26:41.008 --> 26:43.069
I don't know if it was good
luck, but it was luck.

26:43.132 --> 26:44.740
- You?
- MARIA: We scoured

26:44.765 --> 26:47.977
this store for jewelry that
said "Tsela" on it, but nada.

26:48.002 --> 26:50.379
Although I did manage to
spend an entire week's worth

26:50.404 --> 26:52.052
of tips anyway.

26:52.077 --> 26:53.537
Tsela?

26:53.562 --> 26:54.855
Yeah. It was printed

26:54.880 --> 26:56.552
on the back of my
grandmother's necklace.

26:56.577 --> 26:58.794
I thought I might find
some answers here.

26:58.819 --> 27:01.122
Well, apparently, um, it is Navajo

27:01.147 --> 27:02.338
for "star on the ground."

27:02.363 --> 27:03.701
So, you guys ready to go?

27:03.726 --> 27:05.300
(WHISPERS): "Star on the ground"?

27:05.325 --> 27:06.719
Maria?

27:07.160 --> 27:08.912
What year was your grandmother born?

27:08.937 --> 27:11.557
Uh, '48, I think.

27:15.673 --> 27:17.591
Was she adopted?

27:18.099 --> 27:19.897
Yeah.

27:21.393 --> 27:23.276
Oh, my God.

27:23.516 --> 27:25.696
Your grandmother...

27:26.289 --> 27:28.156
was my sister.

27:35.121 --> 27:37.722
That actually explains a lot.

27:40.344 --> 27:45.180
(EXHALES) Dad's chocolate caliente.

27:45.435 --> 27:47.559
The booze is relative to his gratitude,

27:47.584 --> 27:50.727
so proceed with caution.

27:53.300 --> 27:55.273
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

27:55.419 --> 27:57.735
(COUGHS, LAUGHS)

27:58.339 --> 28:00.125
Diego, I never would have reached out

28:00.150 --> 28:01.988
if it weren't an emergency.

28:03.719 --> 28:05.495
Thank your mom for me.

28:06.034 --> 28:09.372
The senator was more than
happy to call in a favor.

28:09.903 --> 28:12.040
She's always liked you.

28:13.218 --> 28:14.919
I like her, too.

28:14.944 --> 28:16.489
We need more people like her.

28:16.514 --> 28:19.589
Look, we got lucky your
dad got out at all,

28:19.614 --> 28:21.699
much less without an ankle monitor.

28:21.724 --> 28:24.362
And you pissed a few
people off back there,

28:24.387 --> 28:27.973
so it's not likely that
this is the end for you.

28:27.998 --> 28:29.249
Who's your lawyer?

28:29.274 --> 28:30.600
Or should I make some calls?

28:30.625 --> 28:33.729
No. You've done enough.

28:36.148 --> 28:39.056
After what I did, I can't even believe

28:39.081 --> 28:41.361
you listened to my voice mail.

28:43.215 --> 28:44.865
It's okay.

28:48.482 --> 28:50.651
How did you get here so fast?

28:50.676 --> 28:52.957
I was at the airport in Phoenix

28:52.982 --> 28:54.207
when you called.

28:54.232 --> 28:57.336
Just had to reroute real fast.
(CHUCKLES)

28:57.853 --> 28:59.587
And how have you been?

28:59.612 --> 29:03.134
Well, my fiancée left me.

29:04.724 --> 29:06.560
(LAUGHS)

29:06.909 --> 29:08.446
I'm kidding.

29:08.471 --> 29:09.541
I'm kidding.

29:09.566 --> 29:11.610
No, I'm seeing someone. It's
getting pretty serious,

29:11.635 --> 29:12.918
so... Good.

29:12.943 --> 29:13.940
Yeah.

29:13.965 --> 29:15.229
Me, too.

29:15.479 --> 29:17.526
- Good.
- (LAUGHS SOFTLY)

29:17.551 --> 29:18.840
We can be friends.

29:18.865 --> 29:20.617
- Yes.
- Yeah.

29:21.607 --> 29:23.627
And don't take this the wrong way...

29:23.652 --> 29:25.745
- Mm-hmm.
- Please tell me you're not

29:25.770 --> 29:28.648
wasting that incredible brain of yours

29:28.673 --> 29:31.926
writing alien hamburger puns.

29:31.951 --> 29:34.165
(LAUGHS)

29:34.751 --> 29:37.167
I am working on a few projects.

29:37.411 --> 29:39.497
Nothing I can talk about, but...

29:39.522 --> 29:41.129
I'm not wasting anything.

29:41.153 --> 29:42.672
Well,

29:42.697 --> 29:44.682
all the coolest studies
make you sign NDAs, anyway,

29:44.707 --> 29:46.338
so...

29:48.436 --> 29:49.854
You know what?

29:49.879 --> 29:51.568
There actually is something.

29:51.593 --> 29:53.019
Okay.

29:53.044 --> 29:56.478
Do you know what butyricol is?

29:58.404 --> 30:00.948
Worth a shot. It's this chemical I found

30:00.973 --> 30:02.525
in my friend's tox screen.

30:02.550 --> 30:04.214
I have never heard of it.

30:04.239 --> 30:06.088
Maybe you're slacking, Ortecho.

30:06.184 --> 30:08.097
I am sorry, it has only been a year.

30:08.122 --> 30:10.166
Did you literally forget
everything about me?

30:10.191 --> 30:11.651
(LAUGHS)

30:11.860 --> 30:13.328
Liz?

30:13.353 --> 30:14.521
Max.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.198
You got my calls.

30:16.223 --> 30:17.448
(EXHALES)

30:17.473 --> 30:18.659
Where are they holding him?

30:18.684 --> 30:20.019
He's back. He's safe.

30:20.044 --> 30:21.045
(EXHALES)

30:21.070 --> 30:22.417
It's okay, Max.

30:22.442 --> 30:24.285
I am so sorry.

30:27.208 --> 30:28.552
Hi.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.039
Diego, this is Max, my boyfriend.

30:32.064 --> 30:33.331
Max, this is...

30:33.356 --> 30:34.774
The ex-fiancé.

30:36.324 --> 30:38.186
It's nice to meet you.

Hey, that alien console piece
that Jim Valenti left me.

30:57.106 --> 30:59.108
- Mm-hmm?
- You still have it?

30:59.165 --> 31:01.620
No. I sold it on eBay.

Funny.

31:04.972 --> 31:06.591
(SIGHS)

31:10.147 --> 31:11.970
You didn't attach it to your console.

31:12.099 --> 31:13.643
I tried.

31:13.668 --> 31:15.306
Doesn't fit.

31:16.072 --> 31:18.749
So, Tripp left this for
my dad before he died.

31:18.774 --> 31:20.385
My dad thought it was a code, but this

31:20.410 --> 31:22.095
is a reference sketch
of this exact piece.

31:22.120 --> 31:23.985
My dad's been looking for
this thing for 30 years,

31:24.010 --> 31:25.448
and Jim Valenti had it all along.

31:25.473 --> 31:27.475
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I'm gonna give it to him.

31:27.500 --> 31:29.518
I want to see what he does
with it once he's got it.

31:29.543 --> 31:30.987
Look, if it didn't fit in your console,

31:31.012 --> 31:32.252
then it fits somewhere else.

31:32.277 --> 31:33.908
My dad could lead us there.

31:33.933 --> 31:35.786
Your dad hunts aliens, Alex.

31:36.757 --> 31:38.634
He'll lead my family right off a cliff.

31:38.659 --> 31:41.328
I've protected you so far.
That's not changing.

You have to be kidding me. (LAUGHS)

31:51.917 --> 31:54.169
I'm asking you to trust me.

When we were kids, you
believed people were good,

32:00.395 --> 32:02.257
despite humanity doing everything

32:02.282 --> 32:03.951
to prove you otherwise.

32:04.687 --> 32:06.650
And, God, I loved you for it.

But what was charming when we were 17,

32:10.678 --> 32:12.291
it's just, it's just stupid now.

- Yeah. Yeah, I do.
- Mm.

32:18.949 --> 32:20.431
God forbid I have faith in people

32:20.456 --> 32:22.447
who don't give me a good reason to.

32:22.791 --> 32:24.091
That's not fair.

32:24.116 --> 32:25.557
- No?
- No.

32:25.582 --> 32:27.504
Why is your hand covered?

You miss your injury

32:29.743 --> 32:31.300
because you want to hurt.

32:31.325 --> 32:33.176
Your anger made you feel safe.

32:34.253 --> 32:35.846
I will always hate my father

32:35.871 --> 32:37.123
for what he did to you,

32:37.148 --> 32:38.848
but I-I don't want to live

32:38.873 --> 32:40.845
in that toolshed for
the rest of my life.

32:40.870 --> 32:42.385
I don't want to walk around thinking

32:42.411 --> 32:43.627
that people don't change,

32:43.652 --> 32:46.119
that one day everyone's
just gonna let me down,

in a reason to stay.
