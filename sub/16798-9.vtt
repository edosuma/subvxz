WEBVTT

00:08.542 --> 00:10.918
The U.K. is on board with re-instating

00:10.919 --> 00:12.875
- sanctions on Iran.
- Thank you.

00:12.876 --> 00:15.644
We can count on their support
at the Security Council meeting

00:15.645 --> 00:16.846
this afternoon.

00:16.847 --> 00:18.230
With a whole seven hours to spare.

00:18.231 --> 00:19.715
Thank you, "closest ally"".

00:19.716 --> 00:22.585
Does anyone else feel
like this should be easier?

00:22.586 --> 00:24.720
The agreement was that if Iran cheats

00:24.721 --> 00:26.455
on the nuclear deal,

00:26.456 --> 00:28.559
then the other countries
on the Security Council vote

00:28.560 --> 00:29.725
to snap the sanctions back.

00:29.726 --> 00:32.328
Well, they cheated, so why are the rest

00:32.329 --> 00:34.497
of the P5 dragging their feet?

00:34.498 --> 00:35.798
Because it's the U.N.

00:35.799 --> 00:38.062
Yeah, okay, you know what? I
get that it's dysfunctional,

00:38.063 --> 00:39.629
but come on!

00:40.536 --> 00:43.105
"Hi, Iran? We're from the IAEA.

00:43.106 --> 00:45.541
"We'd like to inspect
your nuclear facilities.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.042
You know, per the agreement."

00:47.043 --> 00:49.812
"Yeah. No, thank you."

00:49.813 --> 00:52.348
I mean, how much clearer do
the violations need to be?

00:52.349 --> 00:54.049
No one's arguing with you.

00:54.050 --> 00:55.650
In a perfect world, that's all the proof

00:55.674 --> 00:57.153
we'd need to reinstate sanctions.

00:57.154 --> 00:59.722
Okay, what were the key
components of the agreement?

00:59.723 --> 01:03.225
Oversight of all nuclear facilities.

01:03.226 --> 01:05.528
Well, clearly, that's not happening.

01:05.529 --> 01:08.130
Also, communication.

01:08.131 --> 01:09.899
Yeah. Is anybody talking to us?

01:09.900 --> 01:12.067
- Radio silence.
- Yep.

01:12.068 --> 01:15.471
Everyone in Tehran is mute,
so why do we have to work

01:15.472 --> 01:19.508
around the clock to get
our quote-unquote partners

01:19.509 --> 01:22.077
to do what they already
promised they would do?

01:22.078 --> 01:25.179
Are you done?

01:26.415 --> 01:27.950
- Yeah, I'm done.
- Good.

01:27.951 --> 01:29.785
Because we only have a few more hours

01:29.786 --> 01:33.522
to get the rest of the P5
to snap back the sanctions.

01:33.523 --> 01:36.625
If we fail, the president
has made it clear

01:36.626 --> 01:40.262
that he will prevent Iran
from getting nuclear weapons

01:40.263 --> 01:42.798
one way or the other.

01:42.799 --> 01:47.369
Take a moment and contemplate
what the "other way" looks like,

01:47.370 --> 01:49.772
and get back to work.

01:49.773 --> 01:53.209
I have the Secretary.

01:53.210 --> 01:55.153
- Go ahead, ma'am.
- Hey.

01:55.154 --> 01:57.012
So where are we?

01:57.013 --> 01:58.113
Ma'am, we have

01:58.114 --> 01:59.982
pledges of support
from Russia and the U.K.

01:59.983 --> 02:02.284
We have not heard back yet from France,

02:02.285 --> 02:05.187
but we expect their
approval to be forthcoming.

02:05.188 --> 02:07.256
So we're off to a good start.

02:07.257 --> 02:10.860
And yet, you haven't mentioned China.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.928
Foreign Minister Chen
says they'll need more time

02:12.929 --> 02:14.230
to consider their vote.

02:14.231 --> 02:17.066
Which is unusual, considering
they've been in favor

02:17.067 --> 02:18.901
of sanctions curbing
Iran's nuclear program.

02:18.902 --> 02:22.438
So they're still
pouting over the standoff

02:22.439 --> 02:23.739
in the South China Sea.

02:23.740 --> 02:26.509
Yes, ma'am, that is our best guess.

02:26.510 --> 02:29.712
But Jay has an idea for
how to get them on board.

02:29.713 --> 02:33.015
We agree to withdraw
our complaint at the WTO

02:33.016 --> 02:35.851
over China's tariff on chickens.

02:35.852 --> 02:37.186
We're betting China cares

02:37.187 --> 02:40.456
that much about poultry?

02:40.457 --> 02:42.758
Well, bigger deals have been made

02:42.759 --> 02:45.528
over weirder things, so yeah.

02:45.529 --> 02:46.996
Let's go for it. Also, ma'am,

02:46.997 --> 02:48.931
the Israeli ambassador
called this morning.

02:48.932 --> 02:50.933
Let me guess, he wants a meeting?

02:50.934 --> 02:52.535
Demands is more accurate.

02:53.770 --> 02:56.405
Iran has a sanctions-free economy

02:56.406 --> 02:58.941
and a nascent nuclear weapons program.

02:58.942 --> 03:02.344
What could Israel
possibly be worried about?

03:02.345 --> 03:03.612
Good morning.

03:03.613 --> 03:04.880
Hey, babe.

03:04.881 --> 03:06.549
How's the world doing today?

03:06.550 --> 03:08.784
Well, the fate of
the Middle East rests

03:08.785 --> 03:11.353
on China's appetite for chicken.

03:11.354 --> 03:12.755
Yep, sounds like the world.

03:12.756 --> 03:14.223
I know.

03:14.224 --> 03:15.824
Wow. Look at you.

03:15.825 --> 03:18.827
Special shout-out to her
stylist, Alison McCord.

03:18.828 --> 03:20.329
That's my suit.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.197
I was going for a "mod-pro" look.

03:22.198 --> 03:23.599
I had to raid your closet.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.434
Mod-pro?

03:25.435 --> 03:27.301
It just means "modern professional."

03:28.671 --> 03:29.872
What? We share a house.

03:29.873 --> 03:31.696
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

03:31.697 --> 03:32.708
So what is the occasion?

03:32.709 --> 03:35.044
I have my meeting with
Russell Jackson today.

03:35.045 --> 03:36.468
For the Harvard Law recommendation?

03:36.469 --> 03:38.180
I thought that was last Monday.

03:38.181 --> 03:40.416
It was supposed to be.

03:40.417 --> 03:43.152
And also the Friday before that.

03:43.153 --> 03:45.487
He keeps canceling.

03:45.488 --> 03:46.889
I really need that rec letter.

03:46.890 --> 03:49.124
Plus, an interview
with an alumnus carries

03:49.125 --> 03:50.826
a huge amount of weight.

03:50.827 --> 03:52.695
Well, the guy is a very busy man.

03:52.696 --> 03:54.399
Can't you find another Harvard alum?

03:54.400 --> 03:56.365
This is D.C. They're everywhere,

03:56.366 --> 03:57.700
telling people they went to Harvard.

03:57.701 --> 03:59.535
I don't know... the application
is due in three days,

03:59.536 --> 04:01.377
so I don't really have
time to ask anyone else.

04:01.378 --> 04:03.201
Yeah, and in ten years, all the lawyers

04:03.202 --> 04:04.940
will be replaced by robots anyway.

04:04.941 --> 04:07.977
Guaranteed basic income's
our only hope, you guys.

04:07.978 --> 04:10.779
You know we support
whatever you want to do,

04:10.780 --> 04:13.649
but maybe you don't have
to go to Harvard Law.

04:13.650 --> 04:15.250
What, you guys don't think I can cut it?

04:15.274 --> 04:16.885
Cutting it I'm not worried about.

04:16.886 --> 04:18.553
Paying for it, on the other hand...

04:18.555 --> 04:20.356
Look, your mom and I are tired.

04:20.357 --> 04:22.891
We want to move someplace warm someday.

04:22.892 --> 04:26.362
I know that you guys
are very partial to UVA.

04:26.363 --> 04:28.263
- Wahoowa!
- No, I'm not.

04:28.264 --> 04:29.765
You guys are always telling me to,

04:29.766 --> 04:31.867
you know, swing for the fences.

04:31.868 --> 04:35.738
UVA was good enough for
a whole slew of Kennedys,

04:35.739 --> 04:37.039
including Robert.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.663
Plus, Thomas Jefferson
founded the place.

04:39.843 --> 04:40.943
Alls I'm saying.

04:40.944 --> 04:43.712
I know that Harvard is a reach,

04:43.713 --> 04:46.015
but I really want to try.

04:46.016 --> 04:49.318
Which is why I was hoping
that a recommendation letter

04:49.319 --> 04:50.742
from the president's chief of staff

04:50.743 --> 04:53.589
might help put me over the top.

04:53.590 --> 04:55.391
Maybe I'm just being
entitled and stupid.

04:55.392 --> 04:57.159
You and the rest of America.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.894
Smoking on the Hindenburg. See ya.

05:01.630 --> 05:05.734
Well, I say that you plant
yourself at Russell's office

05:05.735 --> 05:07.616
and see if maybe he
doesn't have a spare minute.

05:07.617 --> 05:09.858
Yeah, worst that can happen
is he postpones again.

05:09.859 --> 05:11.947
You go to UVA, where you
can get a scholarship.

05:11.948 --> 05:13.108
- No.
- Plus,

05:13.109 --> 05:15.244
you're slaying the outfit game today.

05:15.245 --> 05:17.279
- Thank you.
- Come on.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.943
We'll give you a ride
to Russell's office.

05:18.944 --> 05:19.648
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

05:19.649 --> 05:22.283
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:26.922 --> 05:29.091
When the IAEA inspectors
arrive, the Iranians' response

05:29.092 --> 05:30.395
is to shove guns in their faces.

05:30.396 --> 05:32.761
What is that, if not proof

05:32.762 --> 05:35.531
they've restarted a
nuclear weapons program?

05:35.532 --> 05:37.166
I agree with you, Ambassador.

05:37.167 --> 05:38.500
We're on the same page.

05:38.501 --> 05:41.036
Then why haven't the
sanctions been reinstated?

05:41.037 --> 05:42.438
What-what is this peace deal

05:42.439 --> 05:43.972
if Iran can behave any way it pleases?

05:43.973 --> 05:46.308
The U.N. Security Council
vote this afternoon

05:46.309 --> 05:49.678
is for the express purpose
of snapping back sanctions.

05:49.679 --> 05:51.747
But it's my understanding
China has yet to agree.

05:51.748 --> 05:54.583
China has voted for
every U.N. resolution

05:54.584 --> 05:57.686
regarding sanctions on
Iran's nuclear program.

05:57.687 --> 05:59.121
Ever.

05:59.122 --> 06:01.323
I'm very optimistic this
time won't be any different.

06:01.324 --> 06:03.826
I appreciate your optimism,
but history has shown

06:03.827 --> 06:05.594
that such a worldview

06:05.595 --> 06:08.864
is a luxury the Jewish
people cannot afford.

06:08.865 --> 06:10.899
We must see things as they are,

06:10.900 --> 06:13.167
and act accordingly.

06:17.306 --> 06:21.710
The United States has been
a very good friend to Israel

06:21.711 --> 06:25.146
for many years.

06:27.149 --> 06:29.283
I'm asking you to trust me.

06:30.686 --> 06:32.588
But who do you trust?

06:32.589 --> 06:35.356
Iran? China?

06:36.759 --> 06:39.428
An Iranian nuclear weapons program

06:39.429 --> 06:42.797
is an existential threat to Israel.

06:44.533 --> 06:46.301
And we will do what is necessary

06:46.302 --> 06:47.736
to defend ourselves.

06:47.737 --> 06:50.472
We are witnessing the
worst foreign policy

06:50.473 --> 06:53.075
failure in U.S. history...

06:53.076 --> 06:57.379
a president who's let Iran
lead us around by the nose.

06:57.380 --> 06:59.548
You think President Dalton
should have predicted this?

06:59.549 --> 07:02.050
I think a four-year-old
could have seen it coming.

07:02.051 --> 07:04.186
Invite a wolf to dinner,
you watch your back,

07:04.187 --> 07:05.988
or you end up on the menu.

07:05.989 --> 07:07.756
But Dalton let us get played for fools.

07:07.757 --> 07:09.758
Worst thing about no
candidate getting enough votes

07:09.759 --> 07:11.093
to win the election outright?

07:11.094 --> 07:13.262
More smug Sam Evans interviews?

07:13.263 --> 07:15.366
The House vote on January
6th can't come soon enough.

07:15.367 --> 07:17.099
I'm hearing from my friends on the Hill

07:17.100 --> 07:18.567
that if the House voted today,

07:18.568 --> 07:21.170
Evans would be our next president.

07:21.171 --> 07:22.738
We need to get tough on Iran.

07:22.739 --> 07:24.006
When I'm president, I'll rip up

07:24.007 --> 07:25.573
that deal on day one.

07:26.608 --> 07:28.944
The stamina on this guy!

07:28.945 --> 07:32.181
How many interviews
has he done today alone?

07:32.182 --> 07:34.183
He's made the rounds on
all the morning shows.

07:34.184 --> 07:35.784
Guy's never met a camera he didn't like.

07:35.785 --> 07:37.386
Good news, ma'am.

07:37.387 --> 07:40.756
China's agreed to vote yes
on reinstating the sanctions.

07:40.757 --> 07:42.658
So the chicken tariff worked!

07:42.659 --> 07:44.626
Turns out the solution
to China's game of chicken

07:44.627 --> 07:46.261
was... chicken.

07:46.262 --> 07:48.363
Ma'am,

07:48.364 --> 07:50.866
the French Foreign Minister
has requested a meeting.

07:50.867 --> 07:53.502
Isn't she in New York for the
U.N. Security Council vote?

07:53.503 --> 07:55.336
No, she's on her way here.

08:01.677 --> 08:03.679
Good morning, Mr. Jackson.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.280
I told you I wanted to see Henry McCord.

08:05.304 --> 08:06.348
That's the wrong McCord.

08:06.349 --> 08:08.650
She has a meeting
scheduled with you today.

08:08.651 --> 08:11.453
For the-the Harvard Law recommendation.

08:11.454 --> 08:13.255
Right. Yeah.

08:13.256 --> 08:15.557
Now's not a good time.

08:15.558 --> 08:16.859
Get Henry McCord on the phone.

08:16.860 --> 08:19.428
I tried, but he's not picking up.

08:19.429 --> 08:23.565
He-he turns his
phone off during class.

08:23.566 --> 08:26.267
Why didn't you know that, Adele?

08:27.436 --> 08:30.239
Um, I-I know you're incredibly busy,

08:30.240 --> 08:32.541
but the application's due pretty soon.

08:32.542 --> 08:35.477
Is there any chance that you might have

08:35.477 --> 08:37.379
just a minute or two later today?

08:37.380 --> 08:38.813
We have the great misfortune

08:38.815 --> 08:42.217
of living in exciting
times, Stephanie McCord.

08:42.217 --> 08:44.253
The presidential election
is gonna be decided

08:44.254 --> 08:46.088
in the House of Representatives

08:46.089 --> 08:49.625
- for the first time since...
- 1824?

08:49.626 --> 08:52.060
You do your homework. The point is,

08:52.061 --> 08:54.863
my part in this historic election

08:54.864 --> 08:56.632
is to cajole Congress members

08:56.633 --> 08:59.134
into voting for President Dalton.

08:59.135 --> 09:00.702
It's grueling, thankless,

09:00.703 --> 09:03.572
and, as you can see...

09:03.573 --> 09:05.407
humiliating work.

09:07.076 --> 09:11.179
But most importantly, it takes time.

09:11.180 --> 09:14.283
Who has time for 18 holes

09:14.284 --> 09:16.518
- in the middle of the day?
- Congressmen.

09:16.519 --> 09:21.990
So off I go to abase
myself on the links.

09:21.991 --> 09:25.460
My 16-hour day...

09:25.461 --> 09:27.963
gets three hours longer.

09:27.964 --> 09:30.365
So to answer your question,

09:30.366 --> 09:33.568
will I have a minute or two

09:33.569 --> 09:36.171
- later in the day?
- Probably not.

09:36.172 --> 09:38.639
Sorry, honey.

09:42.778 --> 09:44.841
Okay, Captain Finkel,
have we talked about...

09:44.842 --> 09:46.248
Henry. A word?

09:46.249 --> 09:48.917
In private? Hi.

09:48.918 --> 09:51.286
I'm in the middle of a conference.

09:51.287 --> 09:52.390
Aren't you Russell Jackson?

09:52.391 --> 09:54.156
No, I'm Phil Mickelson. You mind?

09:54.157 --> 09:57.792
I'm sorry, just give us one minute.

09:59.628 --> 10:01.930
A junior congressman from Michigan...

10:01.931 --> 10:04.074
Hi, Russell. How'd things
go with Stevie this morning?

10:04.075 --> 10:05.267
- Great.
- Good.

10:05.268 --> 10:06.335
Dynamite kid.

10:06.336 --> 10:07.669
You should be proud.

10:07.670 --> 10:08.893
Listen, Congressman Pearson...

10:08.894 --> 10:10.105
you guys still on good terms?

10:10.106 --> 10:12.774
Jeff? Yeah, I guess so.

10:12.775 --> 10:14.409
We kind of lost touch after the Marines.

10:14.410 --> 10:16.611
I've seen him maybe once, twice

10:16.612 --> 10:18.080
in the last five years... why?

10:18.081 --> 10:19.681
He's an Evans supporter. I...

10:19.682 --> 10:21.183
Look, I'm scrapping for every vote.

10:21.184 --> 10:24.186
I need you to bring your old buddy Jeff

10:24.187 --> 10:26.088
over to Dalton's side.

10:26.089 --> 10:27.222
Can you do that?

10:27.223 --> 10:28.657
- I...
- I-I know, I know.

10:28.658 --> 10:31.093
You've got that whole ethics thing...

10:31.094 --> 10:34.262
It's a moral compass,
Russell, not a disease.

10:34.263 --> 10:37.199
I'm not asking you to
do anything illegal.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.735
Y-You believe Dalton's
what's best for the country,

10:39.736 --> 10:42.270
you'd be following a-a civic duty.

10:42.271 --> 10:44.673
A-Almost an ethical imperative...

10:44.674 --> 10:45.774
Russell, I'll do it.

10:45.775 --> 10:48.010
- You will?
- Yeah.

10:48.011 --> 10:50.012
There's nothing unethical
about a conversation

10:50.013 --> 10:52.014
between two old friends...
political or not.

10:52.015 --> 10:54.482
Plus, it'd be nice to see him again.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.419
You all right there?

10:57.420 --> 10:58.620
Yeah, I...

10:58.621 --> 11:01.556
I was expecting more of a fight is all.

11:01.557 --> 11:04.159
Nope, I'm... I'm happy
to do whatever I can.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.894
Well...

11:05.895 --> 11:07.761
thanks.

11:08.530 --> 11:10.632
I owe ya.

11:10.633 --> 11:12.000
Gallais Le Livre?

11:12.001 --> 11:13.802
The ganache, not the truffles.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.771
- Okay.
- My predecessor, Jean Dubois,

11:15.772 --> 11:17.539
told me of your great
appreciation for them.

11:17.540 --> 11:20.475
How is Jean, by the way? Is
he enjoying his retirement?

11:20.476 --> 11:23.178
He's always complaining
about how his grandchildren

11:23.179 --> 11:26.648
are making too much noise,
how his wife is cooking

11:26.649 --> 11:30.185
impossibly heavy meals, and now
he has absolutely nothing to do

11:30.186 --> 11:32.554
except to sit around
and read a book. So...

11:32.555 --> 11:34.856
So, in other words,
he's deliriously happy.

11:34.857 --> 11:35.857
Exactly.

11:37.193 --> 11:39.327
So, what brings you to D.C.?

11:39.328 --> 11:40.762
Kidding.

11:40.763 --> 11:43.265
Why aren't you in New York?

11:43.266 --> 11:45.267
Considering our countries'
long relationship,

11:45.268 --> 11:48.270
I felt it was only fair
to tell you personally

11:48.271 --> 11:51.239
that France will veto any reinstatement

11:51.240 --> 11:53.008
of sanctions against Iran.

11:53.009 --> 11:55.644
We have proof that Iran is not complying

11:55.645 --> 11:57.579
with the terms of the deal.

11:57.580 --> 11:59.948
Video of them strong-arming

11:59.949 --> 12:01.950
our inspectors.

12:01.951 --> 12:03.585
Those soldiers may
have been overzealous.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.421
What explanation has Iran
offered for the incident?

12:06.422 --> 12:07.656
None.

12:07.657 --> 12:10.125
They've closed off all communication.

12:10.126 --> 12:12.327
Shouldn't we hear
their side before being

12:12.328 --> 12:14.496
needlessly aggressive? We can't vote

12:14.497 --> 12:16.898
for sanctions without a
more thorough investigation

12:16.899 --> 12:19.501
being conducted. We
can't investigate anything

12:19.502 --> 12:21.802
if they keep refusing our inspectors.

12:29.945 --> 12:34.015
And didn't Iran just agree
to purchase a new fleet

12:34.016 --> 12:36.351
of your Airbus jets?

12:36.352 --> 12:38.753
And if we snap back the sanctions,

12:38.754 --> 12:41.156
then the deal falls
through, and your government

12:41.157 --> 12:43.492
loses billions of dollars.

12:43.493 --> 12:45.694
France will be far more amenable

12:45.695 --> 12:47.362
to sanctions in three months or so.

12:47.363 --> 12:48.730
Yeah.

12:48.731 --> 12:51.799
After your Airbus deal closes, right.

12:55.237 --> 12:58.073
You think Israel will wait that long?

12:58.074 --> 13:01.843
If we want to prevent
another major conflict

13:01.844 --> 13:03.111
in the Middle East,

13:03.112 --> 13:05.247
we all need to pull together now.

13:05.248 --> 13:07.848
I'll bring your concerns
to President Perrin.

13:08.583 --> 13:11.486
Please do.

13:11.487 --> 13:12.621
So, France

13:12.622 --> 13:14.956
vetoes the sanctions, and what,

13:14.957 --> 13:18.426
the Iranians flagrantly defy
our agreement, and we do nothing?

13:18.427 --> 13:21.396
The other P5 members can't
be too pleased about this.

13:21.397 --> 13:24.366
We could ask them to lean on France.

13:24.367 --> 13:27.635
I don't think that's
gonna get it done in time.

13:28.803 --> 13:31.039
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. President,

13:31.040 --> 13:33.041
but our satellites have detected

13:33.042 --> 13:35.477
a squadron of Israeli F-16s

13:35.478 --> 13:37.179
running mid-air refueling drills

13:37.180 --> 13:38.914
over the Negev Desert.

13:38.915 --> 13:41.516
- What's the IDF's official position?
- That it's

13:41.517 --> 13:42.984
- a training exercise, sir.
- No.

13:42.985 --> 13:45.153
This... this isn't posturing.

13:45.154 --> 13:48.256
They're preparing for
a strike against Iran.

13:48.257 --> 13:49.991
Preparing for war.

13:49.992 --> 13:52.994
Sir, we already needed
an inside straight

13:52.995 --> 13:55.096
to win this election in the
House of Representatives.

13:55.097 --> 13:57.632
If Israel and Iran start
shooting at each other,

13:57.633 --> 13:59.668
we're done.

13:59.669 --> 14:01.703
If Iran and Israel start
shooting at each other...

14:01.704 --> 14:03.772
the election will be the
least of our problems.

14:03.773 --> 14:07.342
The only thing that will satisfy Israel

14:07.343 --> 14:09.578
is an immediate reinstatement

14:09.579 --> 14:11.346
- of the sanctions.
- How do we do that?

14:11.347 --> 14:14.049
The Security Council
votes in a few hours.

14:14.050 --> 14:15.550
Well...

14:15.551 --> 14:17.519
every once in a great while,

14:17.520 --> 14:18.653
a president can play

14:18.654 --> 14:22.790
the "Leader of the Free World" card.

14:23.825 --> 14:26.861
I'd say now's about as
good a time as any, sir.

14:26.862 --> 14:30.832
I'll get on the phone
with President Perrin.

14:30.833 --> 14:33.802
Make him understand that his
Airbus deal won't be worth much

14:33.803 --> 14:36.671
if Israel flattens Tehran.

14:42.344 --> 14:45.180
POTUS is trying to get France
on board with the sanctions,

14:45.181 --> 14:48.016
but if he doesn't succeed in
that, then we need to figure out

14:48.017 --> 14:50.318
a way to get Iran back
in the box quickly,

14:50.319 --> 14:52.787
before Israel takes matters
into their own hands.

14:52.788 --> 14:55.924
Now, given that Walter has spent
years averting World War III,

14:55.925 --> 14:59.194
- I have invited him to join us.
- You're too kind,

14:59.195 --> 15:00.395
Madam Secretary.

15:00.396 --> 15:01.830
It's always an honor

15:01.831 --> 15:04.833
to be dusted off and brought blinking

15:04.834 --> 15:07.535
into the non-fluorescent
radiance of the Seventh Floor.

15:07.536 --> 15:09.704
Though it would be nice to be invited

15:09.705 --> 15:13.708
for more than apocalyptic occasions.

15:13.709 --> 15:15.509
Too much?

15:16.244 --> 15:18.013
Why is Iran risking

15:18.014 --> 15:21.416
driving its economy
into the ditch again?

15:21.417 --> 15:23.151
Not to mention a conflict with Israel,

15:23.152 --> 15:25.487
which they have to know is coming.

15:25.488 --> 15:27.389
To his grave detriment,

15:27.390 --> 15:30.258
Hamlet spends nearly
the entire five acts

15:30.259 --> 15:33.561
of his play trying to
answer the question:

15:33.562 --> 15:36.031
"To be or not to be."

15:36.032 --> 15:39.868
Walter, the secretary does
has other appointments today.

15:39.869 --> 15:43.438
As if the choice were merely binary.

15:43.439 --> 15:44.572
In fact,

15:44.573 --> 15:47.242
the possibilities were infinite,

15:47.243 --> 15:50.545
if he'd only asked the question,

15:50.546 --> 15:52.379
"how to be," instead.

15:53.114 --> 15:54.716
We're asking the wrong questions.

15:54.717 --> 15:56.518
That's what you're saying.

15:56.519 --> 15:58.219
In so many, many words.

15:58.220 --> 16:01.456
What's the right question?

16:01.457 --> 16:02.857
Why would the Iranians

16:02.858 --> 16:05.660
want to cheat on the nuclear deal now?

16:05.661 --> 16:08.596
They've been trying to
get a bomb for 30 years.

16:08.597 --> 16:09.831
Yes...

16:09.832 --> 16:11.866
but the real economic benefits

16:11.867 --> 16:14.102
of the deal... the French planes

16:14.103 --> 16:16.671
and some other geegaws
notwithstanding...

16:16.672 --> 16:20.774
won't manifest for another three years?

16:21.776 --> 16:25.380
So, even if it were Iran's intention

16:25.381 --> 16:27.282
all along to break the deal,

16:27.283 --> 16:29.884
why not wait until they
had real money in the bank?

16:29.885 --> 16:31.319
Exactly.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.521
And if it wasn't their
intention all along,

16:33.522 --> 16:35.690
- what changed?
- Unfortunately,

16:35.691 --> 16:38.860
the only people who know the
real answer to those questions

16:38.861 --> 16:40.662
are the Iranians.

16:40.663 --> 16:42.430
Tehran has gone quiet.

16:42.431 --> 16:44.265
Then, perhaps, we shouldn't speak

16:44.266 --> 16:47.968
to the Iranians in Tehran.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.606
The Iranian nuclear physicists

16:51.607 --> 16:54.075
who went to Vasily Heavy
Industries, they're...

16:54.076 --> 16:55.579
- they're still in Moscow.
- Reach out

16:55.580 --> 16:57.897
to the Russian Federal
Migration Service.

16:57.898 --> 16:58.898
Thanks, Walter.

17:00.816 --> 17:03.784
This could work.

17:05.000 --> 17:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:22.613 --> 17:23.881
Yeah!

17:23.882 --> 17:25.215
Boom! There it is.

17:25.217 --> 17:26.751
- Good game.
- Yeah...

17:26.752 --> 17:28.419
Best three out of five?

17:28.420 --> 17:29.587
No, no, no.

17:29.588 --> 17:31.656
No. Law of diminishing returns.

17:31.657 --> 17:32.790
Kind of like...

17:32.791 --> 17:34.825
Sam Evans' economic proposals.

17:36.495 --> 17:39.196
You're a broken record, man...

17:40.766 --> 17:42.099
You're fighting

17:42.100 --> 17:44.435
a losing battle. Michigan's
a blue-collar state.

17:44.436 --> 17:46.404
Dalton's too weak on trade.

17:46.405 --> 17:49.106
So, you'd rather go with
Sam Evans, the protectionist?

17:49.107 --> 17:50.441
I mean, come on.

17:50.442 --> 17:52.443
Haven't heard ideas like
that since Herbert Hoover.

17:52.444 --> 17:53.877
We all know how that turned out.

17:53.878 --> 17:55.713
You already lost two games today.

17:55.714 --> 17:57.748
You want to call the
policy debate a draw?

17:57.749 --> 18:00.117
It was good to see you, Jeff.

18:00.118 --> 18:03.421
Please, um, give my love
to Val and the girls, yeah?

18:03.422 --> 18:06.123
Actually, um...

18:06.124 --> 18:08.926
Val and I are getting a divorce.

18:08.927 --> 18:11.429
I moved out three months ago.

18:12.597 --> 18:14.398
Jeff, I'm so sorry to hear that.

18:14.399 --> 18:17.168
Well, I'm around if you need anything.

18:17.169 --> 18:18.436
What I need's a drink.

18:18.437 --> 18:19.869
You in?

18:21.205 --> 18:22.940
Russian Immigration detained
the Iranian physicists

18:22.941 --> 18:24.375
before they could leave Russia.

18:24.376 --> 18:27.011
They've got them in holding
at their building in Khotkovo.

18:27.012 --> 18:29.146
What excuse did they
give for picking them up?

18:29.147 --> 18:31.182
Improper completion of a migration card

18:31.183 --> 18:32.646
at the border checkpoint.

18:32.647 --> 18:35.886
I suppose we shouldn't
worry that it was so easy

18:35.887 --> 18:38.055
for Russia to detain foreign citizens

18:38.056 --> 18:40.358
on entirely trumped up charges?

18:40.359 --> 18:41.826
Right. I know, got it.

18:41.827 --> 18:43.227
Different problem, different day.

18:43.228 --> 18:45.496
Hey. What's going on?

18:45.497 --> 18:47.698
He's detailing a laundry list

18:47.699 --> 18:49.633
of violations, Threatening prison

18:49.634 --> 18:51.435
on the Siberian tundra.

18:51.436 --> 18:54.805
Wow. Let's all put aside our
Fifth Amendment heebie-jeebies

18:54.806 --> 18:56.307
and get this done.

18:57.609 --> 18:58.642
She's demanding to know

18:58.643 --> 18:59.844
what they're doing in Russia.

19:06.451 --> 19:07.752
What was that?

19:07.753 --> 19:09.453
Such a bald-faced, childish lie.

19:09.454 --> 19:11.489
It's not worthy of repeating.

19:11.490 --> 19:12.690
Tell them that they were seen

19:12.691 --> 19:14.625
outside of Vasily Heavy Industries.

19:14.626 --> 19:16.060
Ask them why they were there.

19:23.201 --> 19:25.436
He says that they got lost.

19:25.437 --> 19:27.505
You notice the same
two guys keep talking?

19:27.506 --> 19:29.640
Yeah. And one's just sitting there.

19:29.641 --> 19:32.543
Separate them, and keep
the quiet one with you.

19:42.753 --> 19:44.536
Tell him you want to get him home.

19:44.537 --> 19:46.223
Back to his family.

19:46.224 --> 19:48.359
But first you need answers.

19:51.462 --> 19:54.864
Pour him a glass of water.

19:59.370 --> 20:02.038
Now wait. Just wait.

20:09.447 --> 20:11.510
Okay, now tell him his
friends are in separate rooms

20:11.511 --> 20:14.084
and only the first one of
them to confess the truth

20:14.085 --> 20:15.652
gets to go home.

20:50.020 --> 20:51.856
They were at Vasily Heavy Industries

20:51.857 --> 20:53.224
to inspect nuclear technology.

20:53.225 --> 20:56.927
The tech was then purchased
by the Razmian Bank

20:56.928 --> 20:59.296
- and sent back to Iran.
- Who did they send it to?

21:00.866 --> 21:02.700
Hossein Pakvar.

21:02.701 --> 21:04.568
Pakvar, works for this guy,

21:04.569 --> 21:06.337
Mohammed Abedini.

21:06.338 --> 21:08.939
Abedini's a member of
Iran's Assembly of Experts.

21:08.940 --> 21:11.342
The ones in charge of
choosing the supreme leader,

21:11.343 --> 21:12.843
monitoring his activities.

21:12.844 --> 21:14.245
This feels

21:14.246 --> 21:16.013
like disturbing news,

21:16.014 --> 21:18.181
but you two look oddly pleased.

21:19.483 --> 21:21.819
I'm assuming there's a part two?

21:21.820 --> 21:22.953
Abedini's been one of
the most vocal critics

21:22.954 --> 21:24.617
of the supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ruhmeini,

21:24.618 --> 21:25.389
in the Assembly.

21:25.390 --> 21:27.114
Guy's been criticizing
him at every turn.

21:27.115 --> 21:30.694
Well, criticizing as much as possible
for a dictatorial regime. But,

21:30.695 --> 21:33.697
one of his main points of
contention: Our peace deal.

21:33.698 --> 21:36.233
Ask yourself, why did the supreme leader

21:36.234 --> 21:38.168
let our inspectors
land in the first place?

21:38.169 --> 21:39.637
Why let it come to a showdown

21:39.638 --> 21:41.672
outside their top secret facility?

21:41.673 --> 21:44.441
Because the right hand didn't know

21:44.442 --> 21:46.777
what the left hand was doing.

21:46.778 --> 21:48.045
Precisely.

21:48.046 --> 21:50.981
Because if Abedini is leading the charge

21:50.982 --> 21:52.483
on Iran's nuclear ramp-up,

21:52.484 --> 21:56.987
then the supreme leader
might not even be on board.

21:56.988 --> 21:58.055
Ma'am?

21:58.056 --> 21:59.690
President Dalton convinced Perrin

21:59.691 --> 22:01.692
not to exercise their veto.

22:01.693 --> 22:03.460
France will support the sanctions.

22:05.564 --> 22:07.798
Not that I was expecting a parade,

22:07.799 --> 22:09.400
but I was pretty sure
that was good news.

22:09.401 --> 22:11.168
If what Jay and Walter

22:11.169 --> 22:12.937
are saying is true,

22:12.938 --> 22:15.239
sanctions might not be necessary.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.941
Back channel through the Swiss embassy

22:16.942 --> 22:18.175
in Tehran.

22:18.176 --> 22:19.243
If I can get a meeting

22:19.244 --> 22:20.811
with Foreign Minister Tousi,

22:20.812 --> 22:23.279
we might be able to save our deal.

22:32.112 --> 22:33.632
Minister Tousi, thank you

22:33.633 --> 22:36.469
for agreeing to meet
me on such short notice.

22:36.470 --> 22:39.205
And such secretive circumstances.

22:39.206 --> 22:40.773
Well, yeah.

22:40.774 --> 22:42.975
I thought we could talk
more freely this way.

22:42.976 --> 22:44.710
Very well, I'll start.

22:44.711 --> 22:47.880
You postponed the vote
in the Security Council.

22:47.881 --> 22:50.282
Perhaps you didn't have

22:50.283 --> 22:51.917
the other members' support

22:51.918 --> 22:54.253
and are angling for a way out.

22:54.254 --> 22:57.622
I have the votes,
I'll use them if I have to.

22:59.425 --> 23:01.427
Then what else is there to say?

23:01.428 --> 23:04.329
I need a cup of coffee. Do you want one?

23:05.097 --> 23:06.198
You know, it's funny,

23:06.199 --> 23:08.000
because the last time I was

23:08.001 --> 23:09.702
in the Canadian embassy,

23:09.703 --> 23:11.736
I had a meeting with your predecessor.

23:13.005 --> 23:15.306
Zahed Javani?

23:15.808 --> 23:18.444
Javani was a friend of mine.

23:18.445 --> 23:19.612
We attended

23:19.613 --> 23:20.946
primary school together.

23:20.947 --> 23:23.916
Even then, he was an optimist.

23:23.917 --> 23:25.751
Yeah, he was.

23:25.752 --> 23:27.686
He gave his life because he believed

23:27.687 --> 23:28.854
that this peace deal

23:28.855 --> 23:30.189
was the best choice

23:30.190 --> 23:32.825
for both of our countries.

23:32.826 --> 23:35.828
Well, I share that belief.

23:35.829 --> 23:37.897
And I think the ayatollah does, as well.

23:37.898 --> 23:39.565
Which is why I don't believe

23:39.566 --> 23:41.834
that he was responsible
for breaking our agreement.

23:41.835 --> 23:44.837
I think that was the
work of Mohammed Abedini.

23:44.838 --> 23:47.673
The ayatollah would swiftly crush

23:47.674 --> 23:50.242
any such challenges to his regime.

23:50.243 --> 23:51.510
I believe that he's in control.

23:51.511 --> 23:52.545
Now.

23:52.546 --> 23:54.613
But I don't think that he was aware

23:54.614 --> 23:57.616
of Abedini's actions when
the inspectors showed up

23:57.617 --> 23:58.951
at your nuclear facility.

23:58.952 --> 24:02.087
I think he went along to save face,

24:02.088 --> 24:05.124
rather than admit that your
government was fracturing.

24:05.125 --> 24:08.093
And if the supreme leader

24:08.094 --> 24:10.729
never wanted to renege on the deal,

24:10.730 --> 24:12.431
then...

24:12.432 --> 24:15.067
well, shouldn't we do our best

24:15.068 --> 24:16.902
to try and save it?

24:16.903 --> 24:19.538
Even if what you are saying

24:19.539 --> 24:22.007
about Abedini is true,

24:22.008 --> 24:23.642
it is now immaterial.

24:23.643 --> 24:27.213
Iran has followed your election closely.

24:27.214 --> 24:29.648
We don't like what we're hearing.

24:29.649 --> 24:30.783
Sam Evans.

24:30.784 --> 24:32.084
He plans to destroy

24:32.085 --> 24:34.854
the peace deal the
moment he's in office.

24:34.855 --> 24:35.955
That's just rhetoric.

24:35.956 --> 24:38.591
He has no intention
of following through.

24:38.592 --> 24:41.193
Our people are not mind readers,

24:41.194 --> 24:42.161
Madam Secretary.

24:42.162 --> 24:43.362
How are they to know that?

24:43.363 --> 24:45.097
To some,

24:45.098 --> 24:48.500
Abedini's call to
develop nuclear weapons

24:48.501 --> 24:50.803
is a way to hedge our bets.

24:50.804 --> 24:52.872
A Sam Evans presidency is

24:52.873 --> 24:54.373
just a possibility.

24:54.374 --> 24:58.177
Crippling sanctions on
every sector of your economy

24:58.178 --> 24:59.545
will be a reality.

24:59.546 --> 25:01.213
So then I ask you again:

25:01.214 --> 25:02.848
What else is there to say?

25:02.849 --> 25:06.018
Let IAEA inspect your
nuclear facilities.

25:06.019 --> 25:07.019
Surrender all

25:07.020 --> 25:09.255
prohibited nuclear technology.

25:09.256 --> 25:12.724
And let's honor the deal
that Zahed Javani struck.

25:14.493 --> 25:17.930
Iran must have assurances

25:17.931 --> 25:21.800
that if Sam Evans does become president,

25:21.801 --> 25:23.836
then he, too, will honor the agreement

25:23.837 --> 25:25.437
we have made.

25:25.438 --> 25:26.839
If you can do that,

25:26.840 --> 25:29.941
we can resurrect our deal.

25:30.643 --> 25:32.478
Has Evans returned our calls?

25:32.479 --> 25:34.622
No, ma'am. He's still
refusing to speak with us

25:34.623 --> 25:36.715
or anyone from Dalton's administration.

25:36.716 --> 25:38.819
Should I pretend I
have a cable news show?

25:38.820 --> 25:41.053
I bet he'd talk to me then.

25:41.054 --> 25:42.021
The big ham.

25:42.022 --> 25:43.622
That would probably do the trick.

25:43.623 --> 25:46.392
In fact, he's doing a segment
on Wolf Blitzer tonight.

25:46.393 --> 25:48.894
Here you go.

25:48.895 --> 25:49.795
Here in New York?

25:49.796 --> 25:51.330
Yeah.

25:55.868 --> 25:57.002
Call the show,

25:57.003 --> 25:58.304
tell them I'm coming down.

25:58.305 --> 25:59.672
To talk about what?

25:59.673 --> 26:01.573
China,

26:01.574 --> 26:04.376
the perfect Thanksgiving, I don't know.

26:04.377 --> 26:06.445
Whatever, just get me booked, okay?

26:06.446 --> 26:07.947
Israel is still pushing hard

26:07.948 --> 26:09.214
for some kind of response

26:09.215 --> 26:10.950
to the Iran nuclear program.

26:10.951 --> 26:12.418
Just tell 'em to cool their jets.

26:12.419 --> 26:13.452
- Right.
- Literally.

26:13.453 --> 26:14.752
Yes, ma'am.

26:19.425 --> 26:20.693
I...

26:20.694 --> 26:23.462
okay, okay.

26:23.463 --> 26:26.799
So did you and Val try counseling?

26:26.800 --> 26:28.600
We tried everything... counseling,

26:28.601 --> 26:29.935
date nights.

26:29.936 --> 26:32.538
We even put up one of those

26:32.539 --> 26:35.641
harness-type deals for the bedroom.

26:35.642 --> 26:37.476
That's...

26:37.477 --> 26:38.477
wow, okay.

26:38.478 --> 26:39.812
Yeah, well,

26:39.813 --> 26:41.680
I installed the damn thing incorrectly,

26:41.681 --> 26:43.816
ended up falling and wrenching my back.

26:43.817 --> 26:46.118
It was a disaster.

26:46.119 --> 26:48.420
Man.

26:48.421 --> 26:50.356
Well...

26:50.357 --> 26:51.580
at least you can tell yourself

26:51.581 --> 26:54.460
you did everything
you could. Marriage...

26:54.461 --> 26:57.329
it's tough.

26:57.330 --> 26:59.997
Not for old Hank McCord.

27:02.001 --> 27:03.168
So,

27:03.169 --> 27:05.738
Russell Jackson asked you
to come butter me up?

27:05.739 --> 27:06.739
Well,

27:06.740 --> 27:07.773
to make a case for Dalton, but I was

27:07.774 --> 27:09.157
up front with you about that, man.

27:09.158 --> 27:11.076
- Mostly, I came just to catch up.
- Yeah.

27:11.077 --> 27:12.478
'Cause we're such good buddies.

27:12.479 --> 27:14.446
Jeff, is there something on your mind?

27:14.447 --> 27:16.180
Corpus Christi.

27:18.751 --> 27:19.752
What about it?

27:19.753 --> 27:21.954
The night before my final solo flight,

27:21.955 --> 27:23.756
you forced me to hit the bars with you.

27:23.757 --> 27:25.524
Whoa!

27:25.525 --> 27:27.126
Whoa, Jeff.

27:27.127 --> 27:29.995
Come on, I don't remember
it like that at all.

27:29.996 --> 27:31.063
You got me so drunk

27:31.064 --> 27:32.464
I couldn't walk the next day,

27:32.465 --> 27:34.733
- No.
- But let alone fly a TA-4.

27:34.734 --> 27:36.717
You didn't tell me it was
your... your flight test

27:36.718 --> 27:37.703
until, like, 1:00 a.m.,

27:37.704 --> 27:38.704
and, what, the second I knew,

27:38.705 --> 27:40.072
I said we should go back to base.

27:40.073 --> 27:41.573
No, you-you sat back and
watched me pound shots.

27:41.574 --> 27:43.557
You-you wanted to stay,
what was I supposed to do?

27:43.558 --> 27:44.743
Force you out of there?

27:44.744 --> 27:47.046
We were trained for combat.

27:47.047 --> 27:48.847
I ended up stuck stateside

27:48.848 --> 27:50.631
through Desert Storm,
the rest of you are off

27:50.632 --> 27:52.184
flying sorties over Baghdad. You-you

27:52.185 --> 27:53.419
screwed me out of that, man!

27:53.420 --> 27:55.083
You ever think maybe
you're the lucky one?

27:55.084 --> 27:56.789
Jeff,

27:56.790 --> 27:59.124
w-what do you want me to say here?

27:59.125 --> 28:00.459
That you're sorry.

28:02.595 --> 28:04.156
You know, I came here because I thought

28:04.157 --> 28:05.620
you were going through a rough time,

28:05.621 --> 28:07.166
and I assumed, apparently mistakenly,

28:07.167 --> 28:08.233
that we were friends.

28:08.234 --> 28:10.436
Yeah, I'll... I'll see you around.

28:10.437 --> 28:11.570
It's just... it's just...

28:14.440 --> 28:16.207
You should have...

28:19.044 --> 28:21.212
you should have helped me...

28:23.082 --> 28:24.782
not mess up.

28:26.251 --> 28:29.655
Okay.

28:29.656 --> 28:31.957
Look,

28:31.958 --> 28:33.859
you were a good pilot.

28:33.860 --> 28:37.663
And if I played an unintentional role

28:37.664 --> 28:39.765
in keeping you from
proving that, then...

28:39.766 --> 28:41.767
sure.

28:41.768 --> 28:43.434
I'm sorry.

28:46.672 --> 28:48.706
Thanks, buddy.

28:53.278 --> 28:55.913
I appreciate it.

28:56.682 --> 28:58.350
Governor Evans,

28:58.351 --> 29:01.453
ready for your close-up?

29:01.454 --> 29:04.123
You would think with our
foreign policy in shambles,

29:04.124 --> 29:06.227
the Secretary of State would
have better things to do

29:06.228 --> 29:07.326
than stalk me.

29:07.327 --> 29:08.350
You're all set, Governor.

29:08.351 --> 29:09.628
Thanks, buddy.

29:09.629 --> 29:12.764
You're pretty hard to
get a hold of otherwise.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.834
I'm not interested in whatever deal

29:15.835 --> 29:18.003
Dalton is offering.

29:18.004 --> 29:19.267
I don't know if you've noticed,

29:19.268 --> 29:20.506
but I'm winning this thing.

29:20.507 --> 29:21.507
Actually,

29:21.508 --> 29:23.275
I'm here to ask a favor.

29:23.276 --> 29:26.345
I hope you can appreciate how hard

29:26.346 --> 29:27.846
that might be for me.

29:27.847 --> 29:29.114
This should be good.

29:29.115 --> 29:30.449
What do you want?

29:30.450 --> 29:33.318
I need you to tone down
your rhetoric on Iran.

29:33.319 --> 29:34.887
You keep saying

29:34.888 --> 29:38.056
that you intend to
rip up the nuclear deal

29:38.057 --> 29:40.191
on day one.

29:41.627 --> 29:42.828
I'm here

29:42.829 --> 29:45.430
telling you sincerely

29:45.431 --> 29:49.368
that it would have
world-altering consequences.

29:49.369 --> 29:51.403
Like Dalton losing the election.

29:51.404 --> 29:53.337
Yeah, that's what I'm going for.

29:58.076 --> 29:59.144
Is it even true?

29:59.145 --> 30:00.646
Do you

30:00.647 --> 30:04.183
honestly intend to destroy the deal

30:04.184 --> 30:05.784
the day you become president?

30:05.785 --> 30:06.752
Absolutely.

30:06.753 --> 30:09.288
If Iran tries to
develop nuclear weapons,

30:09.289 --> 30:10.822
I'll rip up that deal.

30:10.823 --> 30:12.457
That is the deal.

30:12.458 --> 30:13.692
Already.

30:13.693 --> 30:17.930
If Iran tries to become a
nuclear-threshold country,

30:17.931 --> 30:19.598
we reinstate the sanctions.

30:19.599 --> 30:21.366
What you're saying

30:21.367 --> 30:24.736
is that you intend to rip up the deal

30:24.737 --> 30:26.071
regardless of whether

30:26.072 --> 30:28.173
Iran is making nukes or not.

30:28.174 --> 30:30.642
Fine, I'm being more
figurative than literal.

30:30.643 --> 30:32.744
Of course, I don't

30:32.745 --> 30:34.313
actually intend to

30:34.314 --> 30:35.714
destroy the deal for no reason.

30:35.715 --> 30:38.350
Then admit that publicly.

30:38.351 --> 30:40.652
Put the interests

30:40.653 --> 30:44.256
of the country you hope
to lead above your own.

30:44.257 --> 30:46.625
Stirring words.

30:46.626 --> 30:48.427
You are really gonna clean up

30:48.428 --> 30:49.428
on the speaking circuit

30:49.429 --> 30:51.262
in a few months' time.

30:52.064 --> 30:54.131
If you'll excuse me?

30:54.900 --> 30:56.934
Governor Evans? This way, sir.

30:58.937 --> 31:00.172
Ma'am.

31:00.173 --> 31:01.773
The sound guys are losing their minds.

31:01.774 --> 31:03.942
Evans' mic was on the entire time.

31:03.943 --> 31:05.944
They're sitting on a major scoop.

31:05.945 --> 31:07.312
The whole conversation is on tape.

31:07.313 --> 31:09.180
Was it?

31:10.249 --> 31:12.350
Well, that's terrible.

31:21.431 --> 31:23.330
God, what a terrible night.

31:23.331 --> 31:24.639
Sorry, babe.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.872
It was nice of you to be the bigger guy

31:26.873 --> 31:29.875
and try to be a friend to Jeff.

31:29.876 --> 31:31.977
And the harness part was funny.

31:31.978 --> 31:33.679
Funny ha-ha or

31:33.680 --> 31:35.665
- funny intriguing?
- Definitely ha-ha.

31:35.666 --> 31:37.516
I don't like your stupid friend Megan.

31:37.517 --> 31:38.940
That means you do like her.

31:38.941 --> 31:40.419
Could you shut up?

31:40.420 --> 31:41.987
- Shush, shush!
- Kids, kids, kids...

31:41.988 --> 31:43.555
Guys, your father's...

31:43.556 --> 31:45.824
a little tired this morning.

31:45.825 --> 31:47.492
My God, Dad, are you hung over?

31:47.493 --> 31:48.560
- No!
- Yes.

31:49.529 --> 31:50.529
Okay.

31:50.530 --> 31:51.863
Yes.

31:51.864 --> 31:53.967
Remember this the next time
you think about drinking.

31:53.968 --> 31:55.534
I will.

31:55.535 --> 31:57.369
Okay, show's over. Get out of here.

31:57.370 --> 31:59.304
Go on, go on.

31:59.305 --> 32:02.074
Remember, he did it for America.

32:02.075 --> 32:03.241
- Yeah.
- Go.

32:03.242 --> 32:05.377
Wait... wait, what does that even mean?

32:05.378 --> 32:06.478
It's Russell Jackson.

32:06.479 --> 32:07.599
He's probably calling to see

32:07.600 --> 32:08.800
how it went with Pearson last night.

32:08.801 --> 32:09.948
Someone's about to have

32:09.949 --> 32:11.416
a worse morning than I am.

32:11.417 --> 32:12.417
Hello?

32:12.418 --> 32:13.418
You, sir,

32:13.419 --> 32:14.920
are a miracle worker.

32:14.921 --> 32:16.655
- I am?
- Your boy Jeff Pearson

32:16.656 --> 32:18.657
called and pledged Dalton his support

32:18.658 --> 32:19.691
an hour ago.

32:19.692 --> 32:20.692
Nicely done, Professor.

32:20.693 --> 32:22.527
- Thanks.
- With his vote,

32:22.528 --> 32:24.429
Michigan's a lock and...

32:24.430 --> 32:28.300
Dalton is one step closer to
actually winning this thing.

32:28.301 --> 32:30.936
I'm having Adele send you
a bottle of single malt.

32:30.937 --> 32:33.005
- You're still a Scotch man, right?
- Not anymore.

32:33.006 --> 32:34.740
Why don't you just make time

32:34.741 --> 32:36.208
to see Stevie about this Harvard

32:36.209 --> 32:38.710
recommendation thing,
we'll call it even?

32:38.711 --> 32:40.879
I got nothing but time for her.

32:40.880 --> 32:42.547
Get Adele on it.

32:42.548 --> 32:44.782
And he hung up.

32:46.051 --> 32:49.421
You know, Jeff was dead set
against Dalton all night long.

32:49.422 --> 32:50.789
Well, maybe...

32:50.790 --> 32:53.692
getting all that stuff off his
chest helped change his mind.

32:53.693 --> 32:55.427
That can't be it, can it?

32:55.428 --> 32:57.496
I mean, something as insignificant

32:57.497 --> 33:00.699
as one congressman's old
baggage sway the presidency?

33:00.700 --> 33:04.636
Sometimes it's nice to think
that a small act of kindness

33:04.637 --> 33:06.070
could make a big difference.

33:07.339 --> 33:09.875
Hey, most historical events happened

33:09.876 --> 33:12.477
because some guy fell off his buggy.

33:12.478 --> 33:13.779
Inaccurate, but appreciated.

33:13.780 --> 33:14.880
Hey, Dad.

33:14.881 --> 33:16.815
- Hi.
- Heard you had a few drinks last night.

33:19.852 --> 33:22.187
All right, go to the White House.

33:22.188 --> 33:25.657
I regret that my words
were taken out of context

33:25.658 --> 33:26.958
- when I said that...
- You said,

33:26.959 --> 33:28.527
"I don't actually intend
to destroy the deal."

33:28.528 --> 33:30.195
- How could that be taken out of context?
- Be... Because if you look

33:30.196 --> 33:31.997
at the full scope of my
words, I didn't say...

33:31.998 --> 33:34.766
Are you ripping up
the deal or aren't you?

33:34.767 --> 33:36.670
Not doing so well staying
on message now, is he?

33:36.671 --> 33:39.337
Yeah, it's a little
harder when the message is,

33:39.338 --> 33:41.206
"Turns out my message is total BS."

33:41.207 --> 33:42.541
Ma'am,

33:42.542 --> 33:44.676
the press is still asking
for an official statement.

33:45.845 --> 33:48.313
"I'm shocked that a
cable news show would run

33:48.314 --> 33:51.262
with a giant story that fell in
its lap, just as I planned it."

33:51.263 --> 33:53.303
I'll say you're dismayed
that a private conversation

33:53.304 --> 33:54.888
was overheard and taken out of context.

33:54.889 --> 33:55.520
Or that.

33:55.521 --> 33:56.621
Yeah.

33:56.622 --> 33:58.356
It's good the American people now know

33:58.357 --> 34:00.692
that his promises were
built on quicksand.

34:00.693 --> 34:04.062
Ma'am, the foreign minister
of Iran is on the line for you.

34:04.063 --> 34:05.931
Okay.

34:05.932 --> 34:10.368
Even better it's not just
the American people who know.

34:10.369 --> 34:12.571
Sorry we couldn't do this sooner.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.572
Nature of the beast.

34:14.574 --> 34:17.007
Everyone around here's 20 minutes late

34:17.009 --> 34:18.976
for a five-minute meeting.

34:18.978 --> 34:20.045
No, um...

34:20.045 --> 34:22.545
I appreciate your time.

34:23.648 --> 34:27.052
So... why does Harvard even care

34:27.053 --> 34:30.722
about these terribly
inconvenient meet and greets?

34:30.723 --> 34:33.257
Um...

34:33.259 --> 34:36.762
I guess so you can tell
me about the school.

34:38.197 --> 34:40.866
Give me advice based on your experience.

34:40.867 --> 34:42.134
Maybe judge

34:42.135 --> 34:43.534
whether you think I'm worthy.

34:43.536 --> 34:44.770
All right.

34:44.771 --> 34:46.737
You want my advice?

34:46.739 --> 34:48.907
D
