* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

[ambient music]

01:01.462 --> 01:03.197
- OHH.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.465

- AHH.

01:23.484 --> 01:26.354

WOULD YOU LIKE MY *

01:26.387 --> 01:28.456
* WOULD YOU LIKE MY

01:30.758 --> 01:34.295
- [grunting]

01:55.249 --> 01:57.385
- SIX DOWN.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.320
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.826
- SIX AS WELL.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.495
- IT'S A MODEST
EFFORT.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.530
- THIS CAN BE VERIFIED?
- I HAVE SIGNED AFFIDAVITS.

02:09.563 --> 02:12.700
HOW ABOUT YOU?
- THE SAME.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.568
SO IT APPEARS WE'RE
NECK AND NECK.

02:14.602 --> 02:17.405
- DICK AND DICK.
- EQUAL.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.507
- EVEN, BRANDON.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.810
BUT NEVER,
NEVER EQUAL.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.578
- OH, BUT NOT
FOR LONG.

02:24.612 --> 02:27.215
MY NUMBER SEVEN
JUST WALKED IN.

02:28.549 --> 02:31.652
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
SO DID MINE.

02:31.685 --> 02:32.653
[chuckles]

02:32.686 --> 02:35.389
AND MY NUMBER EIGHT.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.824
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WERE
ANY STIPULATIONS

02:36.857 --> 02:39.660
REGARDING MORE THAN ONE
AT A TIME.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.862
[indistinct chatter]

02:45.833 --> 02:47.668
- A COUPLE MORE FEET.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.370
JUST--OHH.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.572
- WHEW!

02:52.840 --> 02:54.708
- THAT WAS A SCHLEP.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.278
- AHH.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.413
WHERE'S THE BATHROOM?
- THERE ISN'T ONE.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.282
[clears throat]

03:01.315 --> 03:02.950
- I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING TO
DRINK--WHERE'S THE KITCHEN?

03:02.983 --> 03:05.353
- SORRY, BUT I HAVE A SINK.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.688
AH.
- AND YOU'LL HAVE A BED,

03:07.721 --> 03:10.858
JUST AS SOON AS WE DRAG THE REST
OF IT UP...

03:10.891 --> 03:13.561
HOW MANY IS IT,
19 FLIGHTS OF STAIRS?

03:13.594 --> 03:14.928
- NO, IT'S ONLY 18.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.566
THANKS AGAIN FOR THE LOAN.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.334
- YEAH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT
RETURNING IT.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.002
- ARE YOU SURE?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.804
- I DOUBT WE'LL
BE NEEDING IT.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.643
- AS SOON AS I DECORATE...

03:29.677 --> 03:30.844
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF LOUIS COURTURE'S?

03:30.878 --> 03:32.580
- LOVE IT.

03:32.613 --> 03:33.981
- I WILL HAVE YOU AND BEN
OVER FOR DINNER.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.583
- OF COURSE, FIRST
YOU'LL NEED A TABLE.

03:35.616 --> 03:36.850
- AND CHAIRS.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.852
- IS IT WORTH
MENTIONING A STOVE?

03:38.886 --> 03:39.920
- [chuckling]

03:42.656 --> 03:44.792
WELL, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO...

03:44.825 --> 03:46.460
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE PLENTY.

03:46.494 --> 03:47.795
- YEAH.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.731
I'M SURE BRIAN
WOULD AGREE WITH YOU.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.933
HE BLAMES ME
FOR INFECTING YOU

03:52.966 --> 03:55.336
WITH ALL SORTS
OF HERETICAL IDEAS,

03:55.369 --> 03:57.371
LIKE MARRIAGE AND MONOGAMY

03:57.405 --> 03:59.940
AND A HOUSE AND KIDS.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.742
HE WANTS ME BURNED
AT THE STAKE.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.944
- YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH IT.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.946
THERE ARE THINGS THAT I HAVE
WANTED FOR A LONG TIME

04:05.979 --> 04:09.517
THAT I COULD NEVER HAVE
IF I STAYED WITH HIM.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.018
I'M JUST SORRY IF IT
RUINED YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.487
- WELL, HE DID A FINE JOB
OF THAT ON HIS OWN

04:13.521 --> 04:14.955
WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE
FROM YOU.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.626
SO...
READY FOR THE BOX SPRING?

04:18.659 --> 04:19.660
[sighs]

04:19.693 --> 04:20.728
[grunts]

04:21.929 --> 04:25.533
- HELLO? HELLO-O?

04:25.566 --> 04:26.900
I KNOW YOU'RE THERE.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.802
I CAN HEAR
YOUR SINUS CONDITION.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.905
- DON'T TELL ME.
ANOTHER ONE?

04:31.939 --> 04:33.040
- FIFTH ONE THIS WEEK.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.508
- ANOTHER WHAT?

04:34.542 --> 04:36.810
- OH...NOTHIN'.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.513
- SWEETHEART, COULD YOU PUT A
LITTLE MORE ROAST BEEF ON THERE

04:39.547 --> 04:41.081
AND, UH,
MAYBE ANOTHER TOMATO?

04:41.114 --> 04:42.816
- YOU KNOW,
CARL'S A DETECTIVE.

04:42.850 --> 04:43.984
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TELL HIM.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.786
- TELL ME WHAT?
- AH, IT'S...

04:45.819 --> 04:47.821
NOT LIKE A CRIME'S BEEN
COMMITTED OR ANYTHING.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.823
IT'S JUST SOMEONE KEEPS CALLING
AND HANGING UP.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.592
- PROBABLY JUST
A WRONG NUMBER.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.961
- OR A STALKER!

04:53.994 --> 04:56.063
WELL, HE IS ON TV.
YOU HEAR ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.

04:56.096 --> 04:59.066
SOME CRAZED LUNATIC FALLS
MADLY IN LOVE WITH A CELEBRITY

04:59.099 --> 05:00.634
AND WANTS TO MARRY HIM.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.069
OR SLICE HIM UP.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.438
- STALKER...

05:04.472 --> 05:06.106
STALKER?

05:06.139 --> 05:07.741
A STALKER.
OH, MY GOD,

05:07.775 --> 05:09.710
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
HIRE A BODYGUARD?

05:09.743 --> 05:11.078
- WE'LL GET AN ALARM SYSTEM.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.813
- WITH ONE OF THOSE
PANIC BUTTONS

05:12.846 --> 05:14.081
THAT CONNECTS DIRECTLY
TO THE POLICE.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.949
- EXACTLY.
- I AM THE POLICE.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.685
YOU DON'T NEED A BUTTON.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.086
YOU TWO ARE JUMPING
TO CONCLUSIONS.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.889
IF IT IS A STALKER,
HE'S PROBABLY HARMLESS.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.091
HELL, HE'S AFRAID
TO EVEN TALK TO YOU.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.394
JUST KEEP AN EYE OUT.
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.964
- AND THAT'S YOUR BEST
PROFESSIONAL ADVICE?

05:30.998 --> 05:32.633
- IT IS.
- YEAH?

05:32.666 --> 05:35.869
WELL, HERE'S MINE.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.738
YOU GET YOURSELF ONE OF THOSE
PEPPER SPRAYS

05:37.771 --> 05:39.440
SO YOU CAN BLAST THE BASTARD.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.974
THEN YOU TAKE ONE OF THOSE
KARATE CLASSES

05:41.008 --> 05:43.411
SO YOU CAN KICK HIM
RIGHT IN THE FUCKIN' BALLS.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.548
HERE, HONEY.
YOU HAVE A SANDWICH.

05:54.488 --> 05:57.725
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANKS.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.594
CHECK OUT THIS LISTING.
- ROOKWOOD VASES ON EBAY?

06:00.628 --> 06:02.463
- CONTRIBUTORS
TO PROPOSITION 14

06:02.496 --> 06:04.998
WHO'VE PUT THEIR MONEY WHERE
THEIR HATEFUL MOUTHS ARE.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.867
- IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
THERE ARE THAT MANY PEOPLE

06:06.900 --> 06:09.002
WHO DONATE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
JUST TO PREVENT US

06:09.036 --> 06:11.472
FROM HAVING THE SAME RIGHTS
AS THEY DO.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.807
- I NEED TO GO TO THE CENTER.
I PROMISED I'D VOLUNTEER.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.509
- DON'T WORRY.
I'LL PICK UP GUS AT DAYCARE.

06:15.543 --> 06:16.777
[doorbell rings]

06:22.215 --> 06:23.651
- HEY!

06:23.684 --> 06:25.886
- I'VE COME
FOR MY LITTLE HONEYBUN.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.154
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE TAKING MY...

06:27.187 --> 06:29.089
KID FOR A WORKOUT SO SOON.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.759
- WELL, GYMBOREE'S
NOT EXACTLY RIPT GYM.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.093
I'LL GO GET HER.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.028
PERFECT BLEND OF CREAM
AND HONEY, AS USUAL.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.864
- THANK YOU.
ANY TIME.

06:40.668 --> 06:41.935
- YOU KNOW, IF I DIDN'T
KNOW ANY BETTER,

06:41.969 --> 06:44.037
I'D SAY YOU TWO WERE
BACK TO NORMAL.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.806
- MMM, NOT QUITE.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.908
- UH, IT SURE
LOOKS THAT WAY.

06:47.941 --> 06:51.044
- MEL AND I HAVE DECIDED TO HAVE
AN IN-HOUSE SEPARATION.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.646
- A WHAT?

06:52.680 --> 06:54.648
- IT'S WHAT
OUR THERAPISTS CALL IT.

06:54.682 --> 06:55.916
WE BOTH LIVE IN THE HOUSE.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.451
MEL KEEPS THE SECOND FLOOR,

06:57.485 --> 06:58.919
AND I'M IN THE STUDIO
IN THE ATTIC.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.721
WE SHARE CHORES
AND CHILD CARE,

07:00.754 --> 07:04.792
BUT OTHERWISE, WE LIVE
TOTALLY SEPARATE LIVES.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.527
- I--I CAN'T IMAGINE
BEN AND ME

07:06.560 --> 07:08.662
HAVING THAT KIND
OF AN ARRANGEMENT.

07:08.696 --> 07:09.930
- IT'S NOT AS DIFFICULT
AS IT SOUNDS

07:09.963 --> 07:11.665
ONCE YOU GET THE SYSTEM UP
AND RUNNING.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.967
IN FACT, I'D SAY
IT'S WORKING RATHER WELL.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.972
- HEY! HERE'S OUR
LITTLE OLYMPIC CHAMPION.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.642
YES, YOU ARE.
MWAH!

07:23.176 --> 07:26.079
- HEY, HOW ABOUT
GRABBING SOME LUNCH?

07:26.113 --> 07:28.849
THERE'S A NEW SUSHI BAR
THAT SERVES BLOWFISH.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.951
IT'S EITHER THE MOST DELICIOUS
THING YOU'VE EVER TASTED

07:30.984 --> 07:31.985
OR YOU DIE.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.087
- WELL...

07:34.121 --> 07:36.023
AS TEMPTING AS YOUR OFFER IS,

07:36.056 --> 07:38.125
I'VE ALREADY ORDERED IN.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.227
- OKAY, THEN, UH, HOW ABOUT
AFTER WORK WE GO OUT,

07:40.260 --> 07:42.730
JUST THE TWO OF US, KNOCK BACK
A FEW MANGO MARTINIS?

07:42.763 --> 07:44.464
OF COURSE,
JUST THE MANGO FOR ME.

07:47.735 --> 07:48.902
- HOW MUCH?

07:52.005 --> 07:53.774
- HOW MUCH WHAT?

07:53.807 --> 07:57.110
- HOW MUCH OF A RAISE
ARE YOU GUNNING FOR?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.912
- IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK
I'M AFTER?

07:58.946 --> 08:00.581
- WHY ELSE WOULD YOU BE
THREATENING ME

08:00.614 --> 08:01.915
WITH BLOWFISH AND MANGO
MARTINIS?

08:01.949 --> 08:03.584
- OH, I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST THOUGHT,

08:03.617 --> 08:04.985
CONSIDERING YOU'VE LOST
THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE

08:05.018 --> 08:07.020
AND YOUR BEST FRIEND,
YOUR SOUL MATE,

08:07.054 --> 08:08.589
THE YIN TO YOUR YANG,
AS IT WERE,

08:08.622 --> 08:10.591
YOU MIGHT WANT SOMEONE
TO SHARE YOUR PAIN WITH.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.860
AND YOU'RE THINKING
THAT SOMEONE MIGHT BE YOU?

08:12.893 --> 08:14.194
HEY...

08:14.227 --> 08:15.863
I'M NOT THE PATHETIC PUTZ,
LOWLY ACCOUNTANT

08:15.896 --> 08:17.297
WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE IN LIFE
IS TO CRUNCH NUMBERS

08:17.330 --> 08:18.732
I ONCE WAS, YOU KNOW.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.000
I'VE BEEN TO HELL AND BACK.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.669
I'VE LOST EVERYTHING,
EVERYONE.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.136
SO I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH,

08:23.170 --> 08:24.304
EVEN THOUGH
YOU'RE CONCEALING IT, AS ALWAYS,

08:24.337 --> 08:25.773
WITH THE UTMOST SKILL AND
APLOMB.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.508
- THANK YOU, THEODORE.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.880
THE ONLY PAIN
THAT I'M SUFFERING RIGHT NOW

08:32.913 --> 08:36.650
IS FROM THESE
NEW GUCCI LOAFERS.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.619
I KNEW I SHOULD'VE GOTTEN
A SIZE LARGER.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.021
- COME ON, BRI,
YOU CAN'T FOOL ME.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.223
YOU'VE GOT TO FREE YOURSELF
OF THIS BURDEN.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.292
RELEASE IT.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.794
LET IT ALL HANG OUT.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.969
- MY MOTHER
IS A FRIGID BITCH.

08:56.003 --> 08:59.206
MY FATHER
WAS AN ABUSIVE DRUNK.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.642
THEY HAD A HATEFUL MARRIAGE,

09:01.675 --> 09:04.578
WHICH IS PROBABLY
WHY I AM...

09:04.612 --> 09:07.981
UNWILLING OR UNABLE
TO FORM A LONG-TERM,

09:08.015 --> 09:10.918
COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP
OF MY OWN.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.786
THE FACT THAT I DRINK
LIKE A FISH,

09:12.820 --> 09:17.357
ABUSE DRUGS, AND HAVE MORE
OR LESS REDEFINED PROMISCUITY

09:17.390 --> 09:19.760
DOESN'T HELP...MUCH.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.131
AS A RESULT, I'VE LOST
THE TWO PEOPLE IN MY LIFE

09:24.164 --> 09:25.833
THAT MEAN THE MOST TO ME.

09:28.736 --> 09:31.204
- THERE.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.973
DON'T YOU FEEL BETTER?
- NO.

09:34.708 --> 09:35.943
BUT I'M SURE YOU DO.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.711
[knock at door]

09:39.012 --> 09:40.280
NUMBER NINE.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.718
NOW, TED...

09:44.752 --> 09:47.254
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

09:47.287 --> 09:48.989
MY LUNCH HAS ARRIVED.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.996
- GOOD AFTERNOON,
MR. DEMEERS.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.264
- HELLO, MR. MORGAN.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.899
- MR. LOGAN?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.634
I'M SORRY, MRS. LOGAN.
MY NAME IS JUSTIN.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.035
- HI, I'M CORINNE.
- MELANIE.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.103
I'M CALLING
FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA

10:03.136 --> 10:04.772
ANTI-PROP 14 INITIATIVE.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.139
- ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION?

10:06.173 --> 10:07.374
THAT'S RIGHT, SIR.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.142
THE ONE THAT KEEPS GAYS
IN THEIR PLACE.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.878
- CAMPAIGN OF HATE
LED BY REVEREND FOWLER

10:10.911 --> 10:12.746
AND HIS "FAMILY AMERICA"
COALITION.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.748
- THEY WANT THE LEGISLATURE TO
REWRITE THE STATE CONSTITUTION,

10:14.782 --> 10:16.016
LIMITING THE RIGHTS OF GAYS
AND LESBIANS.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.018
- NO, SIR,
I'M NOT A COCKSUCKER.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.252
I'M A LESBIAN.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.988
- IT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT GAY PEOPLE.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.255
IT'S ABOUT EVERY AMERICAN
HAVING THE SAME RIGHTS.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.891
- CAN WE COUNT ON YOU
FOR A DONATION?

10:23.924 --> 10:25.025
- YES, SIR, I'LL BE SURE
TO REMEMBER THAT

10:25.058 --> 10:28.128
AS THEY STUFF ME
INTO THE OVENS!

10:28.161 --> 10:29.730
- [chuckles]
WE'LL SEND YOU A LAWN SIGN.

10:29.763 --> 10:30.764
I'LL PUT A BROCHURE
IN THE MAIL.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.132
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.134
- IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE
TALKING TO YOU.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.436
- WHO'D THEY GET THESE LISTS
FROM, THE NAZI PARTY?

10:36.469 --> 10:38.071
- WE'RE GOING OVER THEIR LIST
OF SUPPORTERS,

10:38.105 --> 10:39.873
FIGURING OUT WHICH
BUSINESSES TO TARGET.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.742
- I SAY BOYCOTT THE WHOLE
FUCKING BUNCH OF THEM.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.011
- I SECOND THE MOTION.
- HOLY SHIT.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.746
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THE NAMES
ON HERE?

10:45.779 --> 10:48.415
SOME OF THESE
ARE MAJOR CORPORATIONS.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.050
- THEY MUST
BE RAISING MILLIONS.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.785
- THE HATE SELLS.
WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

10:52.820 --> 10:54.154
- JESUS CHRIST.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.322
- DON'T TELL ME:
HE'S ON THERE TOO?

10:55.355 --> 10:57.124
- WORSE. MY DAD.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.063
[dog barks]

11:06.734 --> 11:08.668
[car alarm wails]

11:10.370 --> 11:11.939
[banging]

11:13.106 --> 11:15.208
- [sighs]
NOW, EM,

11:15.242 --> 11:17.477
DON'T BE SUCH
A SCAREDY-QUEEN.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.179
NO ONE'S STALKING YOU.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.782
WHY WOULD ANYBODY
STALK YOU?

11:21.815 --> 11:23.483
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
ON CHANNEL FIVE NEWS

11:23.516 --> 11:26.353
AND EVERYONE ADORES
THE QUEER GUY AND...

11:26.386 --> 11:27.788
OF COURSE,
THERE IS THE UNDENIABLE FACT

11:27.821 --> 11:29.957
THAT YOU DO HAVE
AN AWESOME ASS. I...

11:29.990 --> 11:31.324
AAH! OH, PLEASE!

11:31.358 --> 11:33.093
PLEASE, YOU CAN HAVE
ANYTHING YOU WANT!

11:33.126 --> 11:34.828
TAKE MY BAG! I-I'LL GIVE YOU
AN AUTOGRAPHED PICTURE!

11:34.862 --> 11:36.463
- EMMETT!

11:36.496 --> 11:38.365
- OH, MY GOD.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.767
DREW!

11:41.368 --> 11:43.136
WHAT'S UP?

11:43.170 --> 11:46.373
- EVERY TIME I'D GET UP
THE NERVE TO PHONE YOU,

11:46.406 --> 11:49.509
I'D HANG UP, AFRAID SOMEBODY
MIGHT BE TAPPING MY LINE.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.079
- YOU'RE "THE BREATHER"?

11:52.112 --> 11:55.248
YOU SHOULD REALLY DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THOSE SINUSES.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.785
- [chuckles] I KNOW.
IT'S MY ALLERGIES.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.889
- SO OTHER THAN THE RAGWEED,

12:01.922 --> 12:04.858
HOW YOU BEEN?

12:04.892 --> 12:06.426
- NOT SO GOOD.

12:06.459 --> 12:07.895
- YOU PLAYED
IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.764
- I WAS IN WOODY'S AND...

12:10.798 --> 12:12.265
IT JUST HAPPENED TO BE ON,

12:12.299 --> 12:15.235
AND I JUST HAPPENED TO CATCH
YOUR WINNING TOUCHDOWN.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.137
- [chuckles]

12:17.170 --> 12:20.173
- THEN I JUST HAPPENED TO READ
ABOUT YOUR WEDDING TO SIERRA.

12:20.207 --> 12:23.977
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANKS.

12:24.011 --> 12:27.014
WE'RE GETTING A DIVORCE.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.916
THAT'S WHY I WAS TRYING
TO CALL YOU.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.855
I NEED SOMEONE
I CAN TALK TO, EMMETT.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.156
REALLY TALK TO.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.394
SEE, THERE WAS THIS GUY.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.264
A FAN.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.800
[sighs] I DON'T KNOW HOW IT
HAPPENED, BUT, UH...

12:46.834 --> 12:48.836
- YOU FUCKED HIM.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.342
- THEN HE THREATENED
TO SELL THESE TO THE TABLOIDS

12:55.375 --> 12:56.810
IF I WOULDN'T PAY HIM OFF.

13:01.849 --> 13:04.284
- WOW. HEH.

13:04.317 --> 13:07.220
YOU, UH, WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
ANOTHER SET, WOULD YOU?

13:09.857 --> 13:11.791
- SON OF A BITCH
HAD A HIDDEN CAMERA.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.896
SAID HE WANTED 100 GRAND.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.198
SO I PAID HIM.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.067
NOW HE'S COME BACK,
SAYS HE WANTS MORE.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.071
WHEN I TOLD SIERRA,
SHE LEFT.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.909
- I'M SORRY, DREW.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.311
I REALLY AM, BUT...

13:31.344 --> 13:33.480
WHAT CAN I DO?

13:33.513 --> 13:36.917
- I NEED ADVICE.

13:36.950 --> 13:40.387
FROM SOMEONE
I CAN REALLY TRUST.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.956
- I TOLD YOU THE LAST TIME
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.625
- AND I TOLD YOU...
- YOU'RE NOT GAY.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.860
RIGHT.

13:51.398 --> 13:55.102
YOU KNOW, IF IT HAD
JUST BEEN ABOUT THE SEX...

13:55.135 --> 13:57.004
I MIGHT'VE BELIEVED YOU

13:57.037 --> 14:01.641
THAT IT WAS JUST, YOU KNOW,
MESSING AROUND.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.110
BUT I KNOW...

14:04.677 --> 14:09.282
WHEN YOU KISSED ME AND--
AND HUGGED ME,

14:09.316 --> 14:12.085
WHEN WE FELL
ASLEEP TOGETHER,

14:12.119 --> 14:15.488
IT WAS MORE THAN JUST
SPORT-FUCKING.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.857
AND YOU KNOW IT TOO.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.397
LOOK, IF YOU CAN'T
BE HONEST WITH ME,

14:24.431 --> 14:26.099
THAT'S FINE.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.902
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

14:28.936 --> 14:31.871
BUT AT LEAST BE HONEST
WITH YOURSELF.

14:39.679 --> 14:40.880
[car door slams]

14:44.151 --> 14:45.452
- [sighs]

14:45.485 --> 14:48.188
- YEAH, SEE YA.
BYE.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.023
- I'M NOT A NAIVE PERSON,

14:50.057 --> 14:51.524
BUT TALKING TO SOME OF THESE
PEOPLE TONIGHT,

14:51.558 --> 14:53.660
I NEARLY LOST IT.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.162
I WANTED TO SAY,

14:55.195 --> 14:57.564
"HOW CAN YOU BE SUCH A BIGOTED,
IGNORANT ASSHOLE

14:57.597 --> 15:00.300
AND STILL CALL YOURSELF
AN AMERICAN?"

15:00.333 --> 15:02.135
- AND WHAT DID
PRESIDENT BUSH SAY?

15:02.169 --> 15:04.037
[chuckling]

15:04.071 --> 15:07.040
- SORRY IF I GOT
A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.142
- NO, DON'T BE SORRY.
PASSION'S A GOOD THING.

15:09.176 --> 15:12.079
NOTHING WORTHWHILE EVER
GOT ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT IT.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.546
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.949
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
- 5:00 TO 8:00.

15:15.983 --> 15:19.019
- MAYBE WE COULD
GET SOME DINNER AFTER?

15:19.052 --> 15:20.453
- SURE, WE COULD STOP BY
THE DINER.

15:21.588 --> 15:25.492
- I MEANT SOMEPLACE NICE.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.327
JUST THE TWO OF US.

15:29.462 --> 15:33.100
- OH. THAT K-KIND OF DINNER.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.435
- I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO ASK YOU ALL WEEK.

15:35.468 --> 15:38.171
FINALLY WORKED UP
THE COURAGE.

15:38.205 --> 15:39.439
- I'M VERY FLATTERED,

15:39.472 --> 15:41.308
BUT I'VE BEEN
KIND OF BUSY THESE DAYS,

15:41.341 --> 15:43.176
WHAT WITH THE CAMPAIGN,
THE BABY,

15:43.210 --> 15:44.577
AND STARTING BACK TO WORK.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.047
IT JUST DOESN'T LEAVE ME
A LOT OF FREE TIME.

15:47.080 --> 15:50.750
[clears throat]

15:50.783 --> 15:53.286
- STILL, A GAL'S GOT TO EAT.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.193
- [chuckles]

16:00.227 --> 16:03.663
YOU'RE VERY PERSUASIVE.

16:03.696 --> 16:08.235
- UH, HEY, I HAVEN'T BEEN ON
THE PHONE ALL WEEK FOR NOTHING.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.042
[bumps into chair]

16:21.781 --> 16:22.682
- BEN?

16:24.551 --> 16:25.518
BEN?

16:26.553 --> 16:27.654
- I'M IN HERE.

16:30.790 --> 16:34.361
- YOU'RE SMOKING IN THE HOUSE
WITHOUT EVEN A WINDOW OPEN?

16:34.394 --> 16:35.595
- WHERE'S HIS BED?

16:37.464 --> 16:40.100
- I GAVE IT TO JUSTIN
FOR HIS NEW PLACE.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.135
- YOU GAVE IT TO JUSTIN?

16:42.169 --> 16:43.303
- HE NEEDED IT.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.537
- AND HUNTER DOESN'T?

16:45.805 --> 16:47.374
- HUNTER'S NOT HERE.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.708
- HE WILL BE.

16:48.741 --> 16:51.244
- IN THAT CASE,
WE'LL BUY ANOTHER BED.

16:51.278 --> 16:52.645
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
TO SELL HIS CLOTHES?

16:52.679 --> 16:54.414
CUT HIS FACE OUT
OF ALL THE PHOTOS?

16:54.447 --> 16:56.816
- THAT'S UNFAIR. I WISH HE WERE
HERE TOO, BUT HE'S NOT.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.051
HE'S GONE.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.189
- WELL, UNLIKE YOU,
I STILL HAVE A LITTLE FAITH.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.790
- FAITH, DENIAL,

17:03.823 --> 17:05.325
EVERYONE MAKES
THEIR OWN CHOICES.

17:05.358 --> 17:10.330
MINE IS TO LET HIM GO,
AND GET ON WITH MY LIFE.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.199
YOU CHOOSE
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.304
- I FUCKED MY NINTH
IN THE SAUNA.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.838
TWICE.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.039
- WITNESSES?

17:21.474 --> 17:22.475
- THREE.

17:25.645 --> 17:26.779
AND YOU?

17:29.749 --> 17:31.718
- KNOCKED OFF
SEVEN AND EIGHT.

17:35.722 --> 17:36.789
- VERY GOOD.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.193
BUT, ALAS...

17:40.227 --> 17:41.394
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.465
I'VE ONLY GOT ONE TO GO.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.436
ALEX EASLEY.

17:49.469 --> 17:52.839
AND HE CERTAINLY LIVES UP
TO HIS LAST NAME.

17:52.872 --> 17:55.442
THAT GUY'S GOT A SHRINE TO ME
IN HIS BEDROOM.

17:55.475 --> 17:58.778
- YEAH. I SAW IT
WHEN I FUCKED HIM.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.713
HOWEVER, THE TASK WON'T BE
AS "EASLEY" ACCOMPLISHED

18:00.747 --> 18:02.515
AS YOU THINK.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.117
HE LEAVES FOR PUERTO VALLARTA
TOMORROW

18:04.151 --> 18:05.585
FOR A TWO-WEEK HOLIDAY.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.721
SO, UNLESS YOU'VE GOT
A VERY LONG DICK,

18:08.755 --> 18:10.323
BY THE TIME HE GETS BACK,

18:10.357 --> 18:13.326
I'LL NOT ONLY HAVE
EVENED THE SCORE...

18:13.360 --> 18:16.329
I'LL HAVE WON.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.631
- HMM.

18:18.665 --> 18:21.501
- AH. AND THERE'S
MY NUMBER NINE NOW.

18:21.534 --> 18:26.273
[muffled house music]

18:26.306 --> 18:28.208
- DO YOU REALIZE
IF THIS THING PASSES,

18:28.241 --> 18:30.410
IT'LL TAKE AWAY MY RIGHTS,
AS WELL AS THE RIGHTS

18:30.443 --> 18:32.479
OF EVERY OTHER GAY MAN AND WOMAN
WHO LIVE IN THIS STATE?

18:32.512 --> 18:34.347
- I BELIEVE THAT'S THE POINT.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.516
- AND YOU DON'T CARE THAT
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO MARRY,

18:36.549 --> 18:39.486
OR ADOPT A CHILD, OR RECEIVE
DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP INSURANCE.

18:39.519 --> 18:40.753
- IT'S NOT JUST ME.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.289
THE VAST MAJORITY
OF AMERICANS AGREE

18:42.322 --> 18:44.491
THAT YOU AND THE OTHERS
LIKE YOU ARE A DISGRACE.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.793
YOU'RE AN ABOMINATION
IN THE LORD'S EYES.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.228
BUT IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.529
- IT'S NOT A CHOICE.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.930
- WELL, DON'T EXPECT
TO BE REWARDED!

18:50.963 --> 18:52.765
- WE'RE NOT ASKING
TO BE REWARDED.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.834
WE'RE ASKING FOR WHAT'S
RIGHTFULLY OURS.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.636
- THE RIGHT TO PERVERT
THE SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE?

18:56.669 --> 18:58.405
TO MAKE A MOCKERY
OF FAMILY VALUES?

18:58.438 --> 19:01.341
- A HELL OF A LOT YOU KNOW ABOUT
MARRIAGE OR FAMILY VALUES.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.276
YOU FUCKED AROUND ON MOM.
- WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.911
- OH, FORGIVE ME.
SAYING "FUCK" IS FAR WORSE

19:04.944 --> 19:06.879
THAN WHAT YOU DID,
YOU LYING HYPOCRITE.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.917
- FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
JUSTIN,

19:10.950 --> 19:12.652
I DIDN'T BREAK UP
OUR HOME LIFE

19:12.685 --> 19:15.388
OR DESTROY YOUR MOTHER'S
AND MY MARRIAGE. YOU DID.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.390
- [chuckles]
- AND YOU CAN LAUGH AT THAT TOO.

19:17.424 --> 19:18.691
BUT BEFORE YOU ANNOUNCED
TO US AND THE WORLD

19:18.725 --> 19:20.460
THAT YOU WERE QUEER
AND PROUD OF IT,

19:20.493 --> 19:22.829
WE HAD A FAMILY, AND WE WERE
DOING PRETTY GOOD.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.797
SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE TO BLAME,

19:24.831 --> 19:26.165
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

19:36.643 --> 19:39.346
- OH, GOD, I'D LOVE
A JUMBO KIELBASA.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.813
- HEH. WHO WOULDN'T?

19:40.847 --> 19:43.583
BUT REMEMBER
WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID:

19:43.616 --> 19:46.453
LIPO IS NOT A LICENSE
TO INDULGE.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.688
THE UNWANTED FAT WILL JUST COME
BACK SOMEWHERE ELSE.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.291
- YEAH, JUST MY LUCK I'D GROW
A SECOND ASS,

19:51.324 --> 19:52.992
OR TWO 50-POUND EARLOBES.
[chuckles]

19:53.025 --> 19:55.428
- MMM.
- HEY.

19:55.462 --> 19:56.629
FORTUNATELY,
THAT WON'T HAPPEN

19:56.663 --> 19:58.298
BECAUSE I HAVE YOU
TO SAVE ME.

19:58.331 --> 20:01.301
WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT
MY PILLAR OF STRENGTH?

20:01.334 --> 20:03.736
- NOT AS STRONG
AS YOU THINK.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.339
THERE I WAS,
SITTING BESIDE DREW.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.774
GOD, I WANTED HIM SO BAD,

20:07.807 --> 20:09.642
EVEN AFTER I SWORE
I'D NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.479
- WELL, MAYBE YOU WERE JUST
FEELING SORRY FOR HIM, POOR GUY.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.614
- I TOLD HIM HOW HE COULD
PUT A STOP TO THE WHOLE THING.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.616
ALL HE HAS TO DO
IS COME OUT.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.619
- THAT'S ALL? HUH!
YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO EASY.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.388
- IT WAS FOR ME.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.889
I MEAN, IT WAS OBVIOUS
TO EVERYONE

20:22.922 --> 20:24.624
FROM THE MOMENT I POPPED OUT
OF MY MAMA

20:24.657 --> 20:26.593
THAT I WAS THE NEW
QUEEN OF HAZELHURST.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.361
THEY ALMOST NAMED ME
ELIZABETH.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.729
- YOU WERE LUCKY.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.731
- THAT THEY NAMED ME EMMETT?

20:31.764 --> 20:33.500
- THAT IT WAS OBVIOUS.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.635
THAT YOU NEVER HAD TO GO THROUGH
THE HELL OF HIDING IT,

20:35.668 --> 20:37.437
THE FEAR OF BEING FOUND OUT.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.474
BACK IN COLLEGE,

20:41.508 --> 20:43.776
I WAS A "ZAP."

20:43.810 --> 20:45.745
ZETA ALPHA PI.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.514
I COULDN'T BELIEVE
WHEN I WAS ACCEPTED.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.416
I MEAN, IT WAS ONE OF
THE HARDEST HOUSES TO PLEDGE.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.351
AND THEY WANTED ME?

20:51.384 --> 20:52.919
ANYWAY,

20:52.952 --> 20:54.787
EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT,
I'D GO OUT DRINKING

20:54.821 --> 20:57.490
AND TROLLING FOR WOMEN
WITH MY FRAT BUDDY, JACK.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.792
- OOH.

20:59.826 --> 21:03.530
- ONE NIGHT,
WE CAME BACK TOTALLY SMASHED,

21:03.563 --> 21:05.932
AND IN MY INEBRIATED STATE
I CONFESSED TO HIM

21:05.965 --> 21:07.367
THAT I KIND OF
SORT OF TOTALLY HAD

21:07.400 --> 21:09.369
THIS MAD, PASSIONATE
CRUSH ON HIM.

21:09.402 --> 21:10.903
- AND HE SAID, "ME TOO!"

21:10.937 --> 21:13.406
AND YOU FELL
INTO EACH OTHERS' ARMS.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.809
- HE PUNCHED ME IN THE NOSE,

21:16.843 --> 21:19.579
THEN TOLD EVERYBODY
IN THE HOUSE I WAS A FAG.

21:19.612 --> 21:23.082
AFTER THAT,
I WAS CEREMONIOUSLY UN-ZAPPED.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.452
- I NEVER KNEW, TEDDY.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.086
- I MEAN, IT WAS
HARD ENOUGH FOR ME,

21:27.119 --> 21:29.556
A MERE MORTAL,
TO COME OUT.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.758
FOR A DEITY LIKE DREW?
I...

21:38.698 --> 21:40.533
- WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO DRINK?

21:40.567 --> 21:41.468
- SCOTCH, PLEASE.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.105
- AND FOR YOU, SIR?

21:46.138 --> 21:47.574
- JOHNNY WALKER.

21:49.609 --> 21:51.878
AND, UH, SOME EXTRA NUTS.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.517
WHY...ALEX?

21:59.051 --> 22:01.454
[grunting]

22:05.458 --> 22:07.994
I WIN!

22:08.027 --> 22:10.430
AND IT'S THREE HOURS EARLIER.

22:10.463 --> 22:13.733
- MA, I ASKED
FOR PLAIN PAPER.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.469
- WELL, IF YOU WANT TO BE
BORING, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.605
BUT DON'T INFLICT IT ON YOUR
POOR KITCHEN.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.139
THIS WAY, EVERY TIME
YOU OPEN A DRAWER,

22:20.172 --> 22:22.675
YOU GET A SURPRISE.
- OR A HEART ATTACK.

22:25.645 --> 22:26.613
WHAT'S THIS?

22:28.515 --> 22:30.116
A SECRET STASH
OF CAP'N CRUNCH.

22:30.149 --> 22:33.486
"KEEP YOUR FUCKIN' HANDS OFF!
HUNTER."

22:33.520 --> 22:35.054
- SOUNDS LIKE A NOVOTNY.

22:40.493 --> 22:42.061
HEARD FROM HIM LATELY?

22:42.094 --> 22:45.598
- NOT A FUCKING WORD.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

22:45.632 --> 22:46.899
THAT UNGRATEFUL
LITTLE PRICK.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.067
AFTER ALL WE DID FOR HIM,

22:48.100 --> 22:50.002
TO JUST WALK AWAY
LIKE THAT.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.505
WHO ELSE WOULD'VE TAKEN HIM IN,
MADE HIM PART OF THE FAMILY?

22:52.539 --> 22:53.773
I MEAN, NOT THAT I CARE.

22:53.806 --> 22:54.941
- UH-HUH.

22:57.577 --> 23:00.179
- IT'S JUST REALLY DONE
A NUMBER ON BEN.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.415
WE'RE FIGHTING
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

23:02.449 --> 23:03.783
- ARE YOU TWO HAVING SEX?

23:03.816 --> 23:05.618
- MA...

23:05.652 --> 23:07.086
SHIT.

23:07.119 --> 23:09.021
- I JUST ASKED YOU
THE QUESTION.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.156
DON'T WRECK THE HOUSE.

23:10.189 --> 23:11.858
- IT'S ALREADY WRECKED.

23:14.661 --> 23:17.430
AND, NO,
WE'RE NOT HAVING SEX.

23:17.464 --> 23:19.766
- IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.
YOU'RE GRIEVING.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.400
BOTH OF YOU.

23:25.204 --> 23:26.539
HONEY.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.843
IT'S A TOUGH LESSON,

23:30.877 --> 23:33.446
BUT ONE THAT EVERYBODY WITH
CHILDREN HAS TO LEARN.

23:33.480 --> 23:36.215
AFTER A POINT, YOU HAVE
NO CONTROL OVER THEM.

23:36.248 --> 23:39.452
AND ALL YOU CAN DO IS HOPE YOU
INSTILLED ENOUGH STRENGTH

23:39.486 --> 23:41.454
AND COMMON SENSE FOR HIM
TO SURVIVE.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.725
AND THAT HE KNOWS
YOU'RE STILL HERE FOR HIM,

23:45.758 --> 23:47.126
IN CASE SOMEDAY
HE CHANGES HIS MIND

23:47.159 --> 23:50.530
AND HE DECIDES TO COME BACK.
- HE WON'T.

23:50.563 --> 23:52.765
YOU AND BEN SHOULD BOTH
GET THAT OUT OF YOUR HEADS.

23:54.567 --> 23:57.236
[glass clinking]

23:57.269 --> 23:59.706
- SURE, I'M INTO THAT.
NO PROBLEM.

23:59.739 --> 24:00.940
50 BUCKS.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.476
[indistinct chatter]

24:03.510 --> 24:06.746
- IT'S SOMEWHERE
AROUND HERE.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.247
- PROMISE YOU WON'T
BE DISAPPOINTED.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.249
- YEAH, I'M INTO THAT.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.751
- HEY, HUNTER!

24:12.885 --> 24:13.986
HUNTER!

24:16.656 --> 24:17.824
NEVER MIND.

24:17.857 --> 24:18.958
- DON'T LOOK
SO DISAPPOINTED.

24:18.991 --> 24:21.894
I CAN BE HUNTER
IF YOU LIKE.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.496
- THANKS, IT'S NOT
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.097
- THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?
HEY!

24:25.131 --> 24:27.233
WHATEVER HE DID FOR YOU,
I CAN DO IT BETTER!

24:27.266 --> 24:29.902
- I KNOW HUNTER.

24:29.936 --> 24:30.903
- YOU DO?

24:32.872 --> 24:33.840
WHERE IS HE?

24:33.873 --> 24:35.708
- [chuckling]

24:35.742 --> 24:37.076
- OH, UH...

24:42.148 --> 24:43.750
- HE LEFT TOWN.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.051
- WHERE'D HE GO?

24:45.084 --> 24:47.053
- SOMEPLACE WARM'S
ALL HE SAID.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.756
SAID HE HATED IT HERE,
THAT HE'S NEVER COMING BACK.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.129
- THANKS.
- HEY...

24:57.163 --> 25:00.032
AS LONG AS YOU PAID,
WANT ME TO CHEER YOU UP?

25:09.642 --> 25:11.544
[laughter]

25:11.578 --> 25:12.945
- YOU KNOW,
I'VE LIVED HERE ALL MY LIFE.

25:12.979 --> 25:15.014
I NEVER KNEW THAT
RESTAURANT EXISTED.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.215
- ISN'T IT FABULOUS?

25:16.248 --> 25:17.750
- AH, THOSE STUFFED
GRAPE LEAVES.

25:17.784 --> 25:18.918
- AND THAT LAMB.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.219
- THAT'S LINDSAY'S FAVORITE.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.288
SHE MARINATES IT
IN OLIVE OIL AND MINT

25:22.321 --> 25:25.224
AND THEN GRILLS IT
WITH SOME...UM...

25:28.260 --> 25:30.697
YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO GO TO GREECE.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.799
ATHENS, MYKONOS.

25:32.832 --> 25:35.301
- NOT TO MENTION LESBOS.
IMAGINE...

25:35.334 --> 25:39.238
A WHOLE ISLAND WHERE EVERY MAN,
WOMAN, AND CHILD IS A LESBIAN.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.908
[both laugh]

25:41.941 --> 25:43.075
- [sighs]

25:44.343 --> 25:46.579
I MUST HAVE
ONION BREATH...

25:46.613 --> 25:49.081
UM, FROM THE GREEK SALAD.

25:49.115 --> 25:52.084
- THEN I MUST TOO.
WE'LL CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT.

25:54.821 --> 25:56.122
- IT'S NOT JUST THE ONIONS.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.990
- I KNOW.

25:58.024 --> 26:00.326
- IT'S--IT'S BEEN
SO LONG SINCE I--

26:00.359 --> 26:02.695
- NO NEED TO EXPLAIN.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.230
SOME OTHER TIME.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.231
- [clears throat]

26:15.174 --> 26:16.609
[door opens]

26:16.643 --> 26:17.710
- [gasps]
OH.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.313
I'M SORRY.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.985
THE TRASH COMES
TOMORROW AND...

26:27.319 --> 26:29.622
- LINZ, THIS IS CORINNE.

26:29.656 --> 26:30.623
- HEY.

26:30.657 --> 26:31.791
- HI.

26:33.660 --> 26:34.961
- WE VOLUNTEER

26:34.994 --> 26:36.328
AT THE CENTER TOGETHER.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.966
- I JUST REMEMBERED,

26:39.999 --> 26:42.702
I FORGOT THE TRASH
FROM UPSTAIRS.

26:42.735 --> 26:44.036
SO I'LL JUST...

26:44.070 --> 26:45.738
GO UP AND COLLECT IT.

26:47.006 --> 26:49.008
THE TRASH FROM UPSTAIRS.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.013
[door closes]

26:58.017 --> 26:59.051
- [clears throat]

27:01.087 --> 27:02.722
- PEACH...

27:02.755 --> 27:04.056
A LA MODE.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.758
- OH. NO, THANKS.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.895
SHAME TO LET IT MELT.

27:08.928 --> 27:11.130
SO YOU STILL GETTING CALLS
FROM "THE BREATHER"?

27:11.163 --> 27:13.399
- I HAVE A FEELING
THOSE HAVE STOPPED FOR GOOD.

27:13.432 --> 27:15.134
- THAT'S A RELIEF.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.303
- ACTUALLY,
I KIND OF MISS 'EM.

27:20.106 --> 27:23.009
- JUICE. COFFEE.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.310
THREE EGG WHITES, SCRAMBLED.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.812
- IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR BREAKFAST.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.313
- NOT IF YOU'VE BEEN UP
ALL NIGHT.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.882
- YOU KNOW, A MAN YOUR AGE

27:29.916 --> 27:31.083
SHOULD TAKE BETTER CARE
OF HIMSELF.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.952
YOU COULD DIE OF A STROKE.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.787
- I'M COUNTING ON YOU
TO GET TO ME FIRST.

27:34.821 --> 27:37.156
- UH-HUH.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.357
- SO WHERE WERE YOU?

27:38.390 --> 27:40.359
TOOL SHED? SLAMMER?
THE PISS HOLE?

27:40.392 --> 27:41.894
- PUERTO VALLARTA.

27:41.928 --> 27:44.897
- MM, MUST BE A NEW ONE.
WHERE IS IT?

27:44.931 --> 27:46.365
- MEXICO.

27:46.398 --> 27:47.834
YOU WENT TO...

27:47.867 --> 27:49.769
- AND BACK
IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.904
- WELL, THAT WAS A QUICKIE.

27:51.938 --> 27:53.439
- IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE.

27:53.472 --> 27:56.242
I HAD A PRESSING PIECE OF
BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.777
- AND DID YOU
TAKE CARE OF IT?

27:57.810 --> 27:59.445
- ONCE, AT CRUISING ALTITUDE,

27:59.478 --> 28:01.981
AND ONCE WHILE WE WERE
MAKING OUR APPROACH.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.852
- COFFEE, JUICE--
EGGS'LL BE READY

28:05.885 --> 28:07.820
SOON AS THE HENS
FINISH LAYING 'EM.

28:09.221 --> 28:10.923
- YOU THINK HE'S A TOP?

28:10.957 --> 28:12.792
- SOME OF THOSE HUNKS,
WHEN YOU GET THEM IN BED,

28:12.825 --> 28:14.927
TURN OUT TO BE
THE BIGGEST BOTTOMS.

28:14.961 --> 28:17.329
- I'D DO HIM EITHER WAY.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.365
- AND WHO MIGHT THAT BE?

28:19.398 --> 28:21.367
- THE QUEEN WHO JUST
GOT OUTED.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.277
- EXCUSE ME, SIR,
YOU MIGHT WANT TO READ THIS

28:31.310 --> 28:33.212
BEFORE YOU SHOP
AT TAYLOR ELECTRONICS.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.814
- DO YOU KNOW THAT THE OWNER
OF THIS STORE

28:34.847 --> 28:36.282
IS A HATE-MONGERING BIGOT

28:36.315 --> 28:38.484
WHO WANTS TO DENY HONEST
CITIZENS THEIR RIGHTS?

28:38.517 --> 28:42.054
- DON'T SUPPORT BUSINESSES THAT
DON'T SUPPORT ALL AMERICANS!

28:44.456 --> 28:46.358
- EXCUSE ME, FOLKS,

28:46.392 --> 28:48.494
BUT YOU'RE TRESPASSING
ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.

28:48.527 --> 28:51.130
- DO YOU WANT TO DENY US
A FEW MORE LIBERTIES?

28:51.163 --> 28:52.398
- MA'AM, IF YOU DON'T LEAVE,

28:52.431 --> 28:53.900
WE'LL BE FORCED
TO MAKE YOU LEAVE.

28:53.933 --> 28:56.302
- OH, YEAH?
WELL, MY HUSBAND...

28:56.335 --> 28:59.171
'CEPT I'M NOT MARRIED 'CAUSE MY
GAY SON HERE CAN'T GET MARRIED,

28:59.205 --> 29:01.307
HAPPENS TO BE DETECTIVE
CARL HORVATH.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.242
EVER HEARD OF HIM?
- YES, MA'AM.

29:03.275 --> 29:05.111
I'VE HEARD OF YOU TOO.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.413
- IT'S NO PROBLEM, OFFICER.
COME ON, MOM.

29:07.446 --> 29:08.547
- YEAH, LET'S MOVE ACROSS
THE STREET, GUYS.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.916
WE CAN STILL
MAKE OUR POINT

29:09.949 --> 29:11.383
WITHOUT GETTING
INTO TROUBLE.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.786
- WELL, WE'LL JUST
YELL TWICE AS LOUD!

29:13.820 --> 29:15.221
all: YEAH!

29:16.355 --> 29:17.790
- YOU TOO, SON.

29:17.824 --> 29:20.526
- I'M NOT YOUR SON.
I'M HIS.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.161
AND I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.529
- WHATEVER ISSUES YOU HAVE
WITH YOUR FATHER,

29:23.562 --> 29:25.164
YOU SHOULD SETTLE THEM
OFF THE STREET.

29:25.197 --> 29:27.166
- I ALREADY TRIED THAT.

29:28.901 --> 29:30.536
I'M STANDING IN FRONT
OF YOUR DOOR, DAD,

29:30.569 --> 29:32.304
IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE.

29:32.338 --> 29:34.040
NOW YOU CAN CALL IN
YOUR TROOPS,

29:34.073 --> 29:35.341
BUT I'M NOT GOING
TO DISAPPEAR.

29:35.374 --> 29:38.010
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO, HMM?

29:38.044 --> 29:40.446
COME ON, DAD, WHY DON'T YOU SHOW
US YOUR GREAT FAMILY VALUES

29:40.479 --> 29:42.114
AND HAVE THEM
ARREST YOUR SON.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.184
- SIR?

29:48.187 --> 29:49.455
- GO ON.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.057
- YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO DO THAT, SIR?

29:51.090 --> 29:53.325
- I TOLD YOU TO GET HIM
OUT OF HERE.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.064
- YOU ARE HEREBY ARRESTED

29:58.097 --> 30:00.566
FOR UNLAWFULLY TRESPASSING
ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.368
ANYTHING YOU SAY MAY
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU

30:02.401 --> 30:03.903
IN A COURT OF LAW.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.304
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY...

30:05.337 --> 30:07.206
[protestors chanting]

30:10.609 --> 30:12.478
- MEET MY NUMBER TEN.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.113
- I ALREADY HAVE.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.581
HE WAS MY NUMBER...

30:15.614 --> 30:17.449
FIVE, I BELIEVE.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.451
ANYWAY, YOU NEEDN'T BOTHER.

30:19.485 --> 30:20.920
I ALREADY WON.

30:20.953 --> 30:24.223
- [scoffs]
WELL, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.958
GUY'S IN PUERTO VALLARTA.

30:27.894 --> 30:32.932
WE BOTH HAD A LOVELY FLIGHT.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.968
ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A LITTLE
TURBULENCE IN THE TOILET.

30:37.636 --> 30:40.606
GAME, SET AND MATCH,
SPORT.

30:40.639 --> 30:43.009
THE WINNER,
AND STILL CHAMPION,

30:43.042 --> 30:46.412
IS YOURS TRULY.

30:46.445 --> 30:49.515
- SO I GUESS YOU'LL BE WANTING
TO COLLECT YOUR TROPHY.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.050
- YOU BET YOUR ASS.

30:53.119 --> 30:54.853
SO YOU'D BETTER POLISH IT UP.

30:59.125 --> 31:01.093
- HE SAID HE'D GO
TO THE PRESS,

31:01.127 --> 31:03.963
THAT IF I DIDN'T PAY HIM,
THE TABLOIDS WOULD.

31:03.996 --> 31:05.531
SO I TOLD HIM
TO GO FUCK HIMSELF,

31:05.564 --> 31:07.399
I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE HIM
ANOTHER CENT.

31:07.433 --> 31:10.002
NOW THE DAMN PAPARAZZIS
SURROUNDED MY HOUSE.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.904
I CAN'T EVEN GO HOME.

31:11.938 --> 31:15.274
I FEEL LIKE A FUGITIVE,
A...CRIMINAL!

31:15.307 --> 31:17.443
- YEAH, THAT'S WHY I CALLED,

31:17.476 --> 31:19.145
TO LET YOU KNOW
YOU HAVE A FRIEND.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.681
- I'VE ALREADY
CALLED MY LAWYERS.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.183
I'M GOING TO FILE
A LAWSUIT.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.318
SUE 'EM FOR 30 MILLION.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.587
- WHAT ABOUT THE PHOTOGRAPHS?
THEY'RE REAL.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.057
- I'LL DENY IT.

31:31.090 --> 31:34.126
I'LL SAY THEY WERE PHOTOSHOPPED,
THE WORK OF A BLACKMAILER.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.461
THEY THINK THEY CAN
MESS WITH ME,

31:35.494 --> 31:37.463
THEY'VE GOT
ANOTHER THING COMING.

31:37.496 --> 31:40.399
THIS TIME, THEY FUCKED
WITH THE WRONG GUY!

31:40.432 --> 31:42.068
- WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT TIME?

31:42.101 --> 31:44.170
- THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE
A NEXT TIME.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.172
- OH, YOU PLANNING
ON GIVING UP SEX?

31:46.205 --> 31:47.940
- WHO SAID THAT?

31:47.974 --> 31:49.575
THERE'RE PLENTY OF WOMEN.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.210
- MAYBE SO, BUT...

31:51.243 --> 31:52.544
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU HAD SEX WITH A WOMAN

31:52.578 --> 31:54.180
THAT YOU DIDN'T THINK
ABOUT A MAN?

31:58.217 --> 32:01.187
IT'S WHO YOU ARE, BABY.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.455
YOU CAN'T FIGHT IT.

32:03.489 --> 32:05.958
SOONER OR LATER, THERE'RE
GOING TO BE OTHER GUYS.

32:05.992 --> 32:08.294
AND EACH TIME THERE ARE,
YOU'LL BE SCARED SHITLESS

32:08.327 --> 32:10.963
WONDERING,
"DID HE RECOGNIZE ME?

32:10.997 --> 32:13.699
IS HE GOING TO BLACKMAIL ME?
IS HE GOING TO THE TABLOIDS?"

32:13.732 --> 32:16.935
I MEAN, IS THAT HOW YOU WANT
TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

32:23.409 --> 32:25.511
- THANKS FOR BAILING ME OUT.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.980
- WHEN I TAUGHT YOU TO SAY
"PLEASE" AND "THANK YOU,"

32:28.014 --> 32:31.050
I NEVER QUITE EXPECTED
TO HEAR IT USED THAT WAY.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.618
- YOU TOO, BEN.
- ANYTIME.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.186
ACTUALLY, I TAKE THAT BACK.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.521
LET'S HOPE
IT'S THE LAST TIME.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.389
- YOU CAN DAMN WELL
BE SURE OF THAT.

32:37.423 --> 32:39.725
I'M GOING TO HAVE A FEW WORDS
WITH YOUR FATHER,

32:39.758 --> 32:42.128
STARTING WITH, "YOU SICK
SON OF A BITCH!"

32:42.161 --> 32:44.530
- I WOULDN'T WASTE YOUR BREATH.
HE'S NOT WORTH IT.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.198
- I CAN'T BELIEVE A FATHER
WOULD ACTUALLY

32:46.232 --> 32:48.067
HAVE HIS OWN SON ARRESTED.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.668
- AND I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'VE
EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE

32:49.701 --> 32:51.770
OF MEETING MY EX-HUSBAND.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.672
- I USED TO THINK IN TIME,
HE WOULD COME AROUND.

32:53.705 --> 32:56.442
BUT NOW I THINK THAT HE WOULD
RATHER SEE ME DEAD THAN GAY.

32:58.510 --> 33:01.247
- YOUR DAD DOESN'T KNOW
HOW LUCKY HE IS TO HAVE A SON.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.251
WHY DON'T I GO GET THE CAR?

33:05.284 --> 33:06.652
- YEAH. THANKS, BEN.

33:11.257 --> 33:13.359
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT,
EVEN THOUGH YOUR FATHER

33:13.392 --> 33:17.129
MAY NO LONGER CONSIDER
YOU HIS SON,

33:17.163 --> 33:19.165
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MINE.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.699
- THANKS.

33:20.732 --> 33:23.435
I'M JUST SORRY
I FUCKED THINGS UP.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.304
- FUCKED WHAT UP?

33:25.337 --> 33:27.506
- WELL, DAD SAYS IT'S ON ACCOUNT
OF ME, THAT...

33:27.539 --> 33:31.243
THAT I'M THE ONE THAT DESTROYED
YOUR MARRIAGE.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.579
- HONEY, YOU DON'T
REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

33:33.612 --> 33:35.181
- MM.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.683
- WELL, IT'S NOT TRUE.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.251
WE WERE HAVING PROBLEMS

33:39.285 --> 33:41.820
LONG BEFORE YOU
TOLD US YOU'RE GAY.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.056
SO, IF HE WANTS TO LIE
TO HIMSELF

33:44.090 --> 33:46.058
AND BLAME YOU, LET HIM.

33:46.092 --> 33:50.196
DON'T YOU DARE BLAME YOURSELF.

33:50.229 --> 33:51.697
HMM?
- YEAH.

33:56.302 --> 33:59.138
- IT WAS SO AWFUL SEEING MEL
KISSING THAT WOMAN,

33:59.171 --> 34:01.473
WHILE I JUST STOOD THERE
HOLDING THE GARBAGE.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.442
- HMM, I THINK IT'S SHOCKING.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.211
- ISN'T IT?

34:05.244 --> 34:08.314
- I MEAN, THAT SOMEONE WOULD
WANT TO KISS MEL.

34:08.347 --> 34:09.681
- OW!

34:09.715 --> 34:11.617
FUCK!

34:11.650 --> 34:13.852
- YOU DESERVED THAT.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.287
YOU WANT ME TO RUB
THE BOO-BOO

34:15.321 --> 34:16.622
AND MAKE IT BETTER?

34:16.655 --> 34:19.225
- YOU LEAVE MY BOO-BOO ALONE.

34:19.258 --> 34:21.093
CHRIST.

34:21.127 --> 34:22.861
YOU CAN BARELY TURN AROUND
IN HERE.

34:22.894 --> 34:24.630
- WELL, WHERE ELSE AM I
SUPPOSED TO GO?

34:24.663 --> 34:26.498
SLEEP IN THE KITCHEN
OR ON THE FRONT PORCH?

34:26.532 --> 34:29.301
- THIS WHOLE IN-HOUSE SEPARATION
IS FOR SHIT.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.870
- WE NEED TO DO IT
FOR FINANCIAL REASONS.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.605
- AT THE EXPENSE
OF YOUR EMOTIONAL REASON?

34:34.806 --> 34:35.874
AND WHAT'S NEXT?

34:35.907 --> 34:37.176
YOU COME IN ON THEM FUCKING?

34:37.209 --> 34:38.477
- DON'T SAY THAT.

34:38.510 --> 34:39.578
- CAN'T FACE IT?

34:39.611 --> 34:41.780
- NO, I CAN'T FACE IT.

34:46.418 --> 34:49.721
I GUESS WHEN I MOVED BACK
INTO THIS HOUSE, I...

34:49.755 --> 34:54.493
THOUGHT, DESPITE WHAT I KNEW,
DESPITE THE RULES, THAT...

34:54.526 --> 34:56.328
SOMEHOW, MEL AND I WOULD...

34:56.362 --> 34:58.096
- WOULD GET BACK TOGETHER.

35:00.232 --> 35:03.369
YOU DYKES JUST CAN'T
LET GO, CAN YOU?

35:03.402 --> 35:06.338
JUST CAN'T GET IT THROUGH
YOUR LESBIANIC BRAINS

35:06.372 --> 35:09.475
THAT YOU HAVE TO STOP CLINGING
TO YOUR PAST AND MOVE ON.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.210
- MOVE ON?

35:11.243 --> 35:14.146
THAT'S A GOOD ONE,
COMING FROM YOU.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.914
CARRYING ON LIKE
AN OVER-SEXED ADOLESCENT,

35:15.947 --> 35:18.417
THAT "FUCK-OFF" OF YOURS.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.687
YES, I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.755
EVERYONE KNOWS
ALL ABOUT IT.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.624
A CHILDISH COMPETITION
BETWEEN YOU

35:25.657 --> 35:27.493
AND THIS YEAR'S
YOUNG HOT STUD.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.528
NOT ONLY IS IT LUDICROUS,

35:29.561 --> 35:31.530
IT'S HUMILIATING.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.401
WELL, I HOPE YOU WIN.

35:35.434 --> 35:39.438
EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE ALREADY LOST
SOMETHING FAR MORE VALUABLE.

35:42.341 --> 35:45.244
SO DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT
CLINGING ON TO MY PAST

35:45.277 --> 35:47.579
UNTIL YOU'RE WILLING
TO LET GO OF YOURS.

35:57.323 --> 35:58.957
- [on TV] STOP RIGHT THERE!

35:58.990 --> 36:02.361
- I'M A POLICE OFFICER.
DETECTIVE ELAINE BENDER, METRO.

36:02.394 --> 36:03.795
HEY. HEY!

36:03.829 --> 36:06.465
- YOU KNOW, I SOLVE CRIMES
FOR A LIVING.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.800
AND I CAN TELL YOU, IT DOESN'T
HAPPEN IN 60 MINUTES

36:08.834 --> 36:11.737
WITH THE HELP OF A PARTNER
WHO LOOKS LIKE A RUNWAY MODEL.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.939
- THAT'S WHY THERE'S
NO CSI: PITTSBURGH.

36:13.972 --> 36:16.208
- [chuckles]
[doorbell rings]

36:16.242 --> 36:17.809
- SWEETHEART,
WOULD YOU GET THAT?

36:17.843 --> 36:24.850
THE RUNWAY MODEL'S
ABOUT TO NAIL THE KILLER.

36:24.883 --> 36:26.952
- OH, MY GOD!
DREW BOYD.

36:26.985 --> 36:28.754
UH, WE MET YOU LAST YEAR
AT THE GAME.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.356
- I REMEMBER.

36:30.389 --> 36:31.990
YOU WERE WITH THIS LOUD WOMAN
WITH RED HAIR.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.693
- THAT WOULD BE ME.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.295
- UH, IS--
IS EMMETT HERE?

36:36.328 --> 36:37.829
- HONEY, IS EMMETT HERE?

36:37.863 --> 36:40.366
- EMMETT!

36:40.399 --> 36:41.500
- COME IN, PLEASE.
- THANK YOU.

36:44.670 --> 36:47.306
- LOOK, I-I JUST
WANT YOU TO KNOW,

36:47.339 --> 36:49.908
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO IN BED
OR WHO YOU DO IT WITH.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.878
YOU'RE STILL ONE HELL
OF A BALL PLAYER.

36:52.911 --> 36:56.882
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW SORRY
I AM YOU HAD TO SAY THAT.

36:56.915 --> 36:58.617
BUT HOW GLAD I AM YOU DID.

36:59.685 --> 37:00.986
- DEB...

37:01.019 --> 37:02.521
DID YOU CALL?

37:16.835 --> 37:19.271
- WANT SOME?
- NO, THANKS.

37:19.305 --> 37:21.039
- SURE?
THERE'S ENOUGH FOR TWO.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.908
- WE EACH MAKE OUR OWN DINNER.
ISN'T THAT WHAT WE AGREED ON?

37:27.846 --> 37:29.948
- LINZ, I'M SO SORRY...

37:29.981 --> 37:32.017
FOR THAT KISS WITH CORINNE.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.819
THAT YOU HAD TO SEE IT,
THAT WE DID IT

37:33.852 --> 37:35.487
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.823
- PLEASE, DON'T GIVE IT
ANOTHER THOUGHT. REALLY.

37:37.856 --> 37:41.026
IN FACT, I'M THE ONE WHO SHOULD
APOLOGIZE TO YOU,

37:41.059 --> 37:42.761
FOR INTRUDING.

37:42.794 --> 37:45.564
- IT'S PRETTY MESSY, HUH?
- YEAH, I'LL SAY.

37:45.597 --> 37:48.534
- MM, I THINK WE SHOULD DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

37:50.669 --> 37:52.304
I THINK WE SHOULD
MAKE IT A RULE

37:52.338 --> 37:53.439
THAT IF WE'RE
DATING SOMEONE--

37:53.472 --> 37:55.307
- ARE YOU DATING HER?

37:57.476 --> 37:58.510
- NO.

37:58.544 --> 37:59.511
NOT REALLY.

37:59.545 --> 38:00.712
UH, I DON'T THINK SO.

38:00.746 --> 38:01.947
- BUT YOU'RE SEEING HER.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.582
- WELL, I GUESS...

38:03.615 --> 38:05.551
I DON'T KNOW.
WELL, ANYWAY, I WAS SAYING--

38:05.584 --> 38:07.586
- I'M SORRY. FORGIVE ME,
I INTERRUPTED YOU.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.054
- NO, NO, NO. IT'S OKAY.
- GO ON.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.989
- I WAS JUST SAYING
THAT IF THERE'S ANYONE

38:11.022 --> 38:12.791
EITHER ONE OF US
HAS AN INTEREST IN,

38:12.824 --> 38:14.526
THAT WE SHOULD
MAKE IT A RULE

38:14.560 --> 38:15.827
THAT WE DON'T BRING THAT PERSON
HOME, TO THE HOUSE.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.329
- I AGREE.

38:17.363 --> 38:18.864
- GOOD.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.932
- SEE? WE CAN WORK
THESE THINGS OUT.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.869
- THANK GOD,
WE'RE STILL MATURE ADULTS

38:23.902 --> 38:27.373
WITH OPEN COMMUNICATION.
- YES. THANK GOD.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.114
- YOU CAN HAVE MY ASS,

38:36.147 --> 38:37.549
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.117
- [chuckles]

38:39.150 --> 38:41.687
DEFIANT EVEN IN DEFEAT.

38:41.720 --> 38:42.854
I LIKE THAT.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.963
- NICE PLACE.
- YEAH.

38:51.997 --> 38:55.367
- SO, SHALL WE
GET THIS OVER WITH?

38:55.401 --> 38:57.068
- ALLOW ME
TO POINT THE WAY.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.442
- JUST GO SLOW

39:03.475 --> 39:04.976
AND TAKE IT EASY.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.112
I DON'T BOTTOM VERY OFTEN.

39:07.145 --> 39:08.780
- [chuckles]

39:08.814 --> 39:10.782
- WELL, YOU'LL HAVE
TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT.

39:43.114 --> 39:44.550
AHH.

39:56.094 --> 39:57.896
- WELL?

39:57.929 --> 39:59.831
IS IT ALL YOU DREAMT
IT WOULD BE?

39:59.865 --> 40:01.833
- AND LESS.

40:01.867 --> 40:03.702
BUT WE'LL MAKE DO.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.884
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO COLLECT YOUR PRIZE?

40:22.120 --> 40:23.855
- [sighs]

40:23.889 --> 40:25.557
IT'S NOT MUCH OF A VICTORY,

40:25.591 --> 40:28.560
CONSIDERING MY YEARS
OF EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE.

40:31.963 --> 40:33.599
- YOUR YEARS ARE NUMBERED.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.667
EVENTUALLY, I'M GOING
TO TEAR YOU DOWN

40:35.701 --> 40:37.135
AND PULL YOU APART.

40:49.715 --> 40:50.982
- PUT YOUR PANTS ON.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.685
- HUH?

40:53.719 --> 40:57.856
- I SAID,
"PUT YOUR PANTS ON."

40:57.889 --> 40:59.124
GET OUT.

41:02.628 --> 41:05.063
- WHATEVER YOU SAY.
YOU'RE THE WINNER.

41:28.687 --> 41:31.256
- SO, YOU, UH,
SURE YOU SHOULD BE HERE,

41:31.289 --> 41:33.992
IN A GAY GUY'S ROOM?

41:34.025 --> 41:35.493
- YOU TAKING PICTURES?

41:37.028 --> 41:38.229
- I WOULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

41:39.631 --> 41:41.266
- I KNOW.

41:41.299 --> 41:42.601
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

41:42.634 --> 41:44.736
[muffled shouts]

41:44.770 --> 41:46.872
- OH, THE PRESS.
THEY FOLLOWED ME HERE.

41:46.905 --> 41:48.740
- DIDN'T YOU KNOW THEY WOULD?

41:48.774 --> 41:50.041
- I'M ALLOWED TO HAVE FRIENDS,
AREN'T I?

41:50.075 --> 41:51.743
GAY OR STRAIGHT.
SINCE WHEN IS THAT A CRIME?

41:51.777 --> 41:53.779
- HEY, YOU'RE PREACHING
TO THE CHOIR, HONEY.

41:53.812 --> 41:55.280
TELL THEM.

41:55.313 --> 41:58.884
- MAYBE I WILL.

41:58.917 --> 42:03.088
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO FIGHT IT.

42:03.121 --> 42:04.790
- MAYBE I CAN'T FIGHT IT.

42:07.659 --> 42:11.062
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT ME
HAVING FEELINGS FOR YOU...

42:11.096 --> 42:12.230
IT'S TRUE.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.035
THERE MIGHT BE
A PART OF ME THAT...

42:17.068 --> 42:18.970
NO, THERE
IS A PART OF ME...
