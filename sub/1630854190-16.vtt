So Help Me Todd...Maybe Aunt Patty

00:08.138 --> 00:10.619
could come down.I don't want Aunt Patty
to come down.

00:10.662 --> 00:11.924
When's the last time
you were in a cemetery?

00:11.968 --> 00:14.840
Dad.Yeah, me, too.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.581
I'm not a client.TODD:
You're Susan's fiancÃ©.

00:16.625 --> 00:17.843
[sighs]

00:17.887 --> 00:19.802
TODD:
You kissed me, in my office,

00:19.845 --> 00:21.630
and now you're just like,
"No, it never happened"?

00:24.546 --> 00:26.504
Oh, it's really starting
to hit me.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.767
[chuckles] Susan,
you'll be fine.

00:28.811 --> 00:31.161
I was also petrified
on my first day

00:31.205 --> 00:33.207
of my first trial
as lead attorney,

00:33.250 --> 00:37.515
and the surprise witness was
my high school boyfriend Chip.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.691
But I still won,
and you will, too.

00:39.735 --> 00:41.258
I feel like I can't breathe.

00:41.302 --> 00:43.173
It's a simple civil trial.

00:43.217 --> 00:44.827
You can do this.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.524
I'm gonna run upstairs
for a quick hearing,

00:46.568 --> 00:48.526
and I'll be right back
down to see you in action.

00:48.570 --> 00:49.962
Okay? Yes.
Okay.

00:50.006 --> 00:51.181
You're going
to kill it.

00:52.443 --> 00:53.662
[exhales]

00:56.186 --> 00:58.710
And we will prove, beyond
a shadow of a doubt,

00:58.754 --> 01:02.888
that the Total Eclipse
Shampoo company, um,

01:02.932 --> 01:05.543
caused my-- caused
my client, Ms. Hayes,

01:05.587 --> 01:07.632
to suffer from
first-degree...

01:07.676 --> 01:09.982
to-to suffer from
loss of hair,

01:10.026 --> 01:12.115
loss of motor
function,

01:12.159 --> 01:15.379
and-and second-degree
burns to her head.

01:18.730 --> 01:21.559
Through our independent testing,
we will show

01:21.603 --> 01:24.127
that this batch of
shampoo was tainted

01:24.170 --> 01:25.781
with dangerous chemicals,

01:25.824 --> 01:28.175
and that the Total Eclipse
Shampoo parent company was...

01:28.218 --> 01:29.828
[woman coughing]

01:29.872 --> 01:31.569
Ma'am, are you okay?

01:31.613 --> 01:34.354
[others shouting, screaming]

01:34.398 --> 01:36.313
MAN: Someone get a doctor!WOMAN: Is she okay?

01:36.357 --> 01:39.142
MAN: Somebody call 911!WOMAN: Is she breathing?

01:39.186 --> 01:41.666
What's going on? What...

01:41.710 --> 01:44.408
What is going-- Oh, my God.

01:44.452 --> 01:46.541
Oh, my God, what happened?
What happ...

01:46.584 --> 01:49.065
Susan?

01:49.109 --> 01:52.155
Well, I killed it.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.461
You put it in the microwave
for 30 seconds,

01:53.503 --> 01:55.550
it tastes a billion times
better.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.551
Whoa, holy...

01:57.595 --> 02:00.381
A juror on Susan's trial died?

02:00.424 --> 02:02.383
Uh-huh. Well, wait,
What do you mean "unnatural"?

02:02.426 --> 02:04.385
It wasn't a stroke?

02:04.428 --> 02:05.864
She was poisoned?

02:05.908 --> 02:07.997
NEWS ANCHOR:
Yesterday, a juror died.

02:08.039 --> 02:10.695
And today, another juror
was taken into custody

02:10.739 --> 02:12.219
for suspected murder.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.569
What's happening?They arrested
juror number three.

02:14.612 --> 02:16.179
FRANCEY:Oh, my God in heaven.
That's Amy Morelin.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.353
TODD:
Who's Amy Morelin?

02:17.398 --> 02:19.313
Rose Festival Queen. 2008?

02:19.356 --> 02:21.053
That's Queen Amy?Yep.

02:21.097 --> 02:23.360
TODD:
Oh, my God.

02:23.404 --> 02:25.841
She looks exactly the same,
but older.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.712
And in custody.She looks good.

02:29.932 --> 02:32.978
And what did the police say?

02:33.022 --> 02:35.459
The water bottle
under Irene's chair

02:35.503 --> 02:38.288
was tainted with a poison
made from plant fertilizer.

02:38.332 --> 02:41.117
And there were only two sets
of fingerprints on the bottle.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.772
The dead juror Irene's...

02:43.815 --> 02:44.990
And Amy's.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.427
Yeah.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.951
[sighs]:
Oh, God.

02:48.994 --> 02:51.562
Amy works as a florist.
At a gardening shop.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.738
Access. What about motive?

02:53.781 --> 02:55.784
Well, there was the tape.

02:55.827 --> 02:58.003
LYLE:Day before the murder,
courthouse parking lot.

02:58.047 --> 03:00.223
MARGARET:
Mm-hmm.That's Amy, that's Irene.

03:00.267 --> 03:01.833
Mm-hmm.No sound, unfortunately.

03:01.877 --> 03:03.052
But from the looks of it,

03:03.095 --> 03:05.402
they did not like
each other, at all.

03:05.446 --> 03:08.710
But Amy seemed so
nice, and smart.

03:08.753 --> 03:10.973
I thought that she would be
my alpha juror.

03:11.016 --> 03:12.583
And she's moving to New York
next month

03:12.627 --> 03:15.151
to start law school at Cornell,
just like I did.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.849
It's just hard to believe that
she would jeopardize all of that

03:17.893 --> 03:19.068
by poisoning someone.

03:19.111 --> 03:20.374
But she wouldn't.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.071
She had her whole
life ahead of her.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.899
She was Rose Festival Queen.

03:23.942 --> 03:25.683
Who may have thorns
we don't know about.

03:25.727 --> 03:28.947
I'm going to get all
the files from the trial.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.601
MARGARET:
Close the door behind you.Yeah.

03:34.170 --> 03:36.868
[crying]:
Margaret, my first trial.

03:36.912 --> 03:40.089
And that poor woman
was murdered,

03:40.132 --> 03:43.005
and another one is just gonna
go to jail for what, forever?

03:43.048 --> 03:44.876
I just can't stand it.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.052
Susan, I know. It's awful.

03:47.096 --> 03:49.620
But there is nothing
that you can do about it now.

03:49.664 --> 03:50.839
You're a witness

03:50.882 --> 03:52.057
to the murder.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.406
But you could represent her.

03:53.450 --> 03:55.583
I mean, you always told
me to trust my gut.

03:55.626 --> 03:56.888
And Margaret, in my gut,

03:56.932 --> 04:00.152
I know that Amy
did not murder that woman.

04:00.196 --> 04:02.633
Help her.
Please, Margaret.

04:02.677 --> 04:03.852
Help me.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.378
[beeping]

04:10.337 --> 04:13.775
So, the fight, in
the parking lot.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.646
I think I maybe stole

04:15.690 --> 04:17.692
a parking space
from her, accidentally?

04:17.735 --> 04:20.390
I-I really don't know.

04:20.434 --> 04:21.870
I, uh, I didn't see her.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.175
And then, when I
got out of my car,

04:23.219 --> 04:24.351
she just started
screaming at me.

04:24.394 --> 04:25.917
And you gave it right back.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.572
Well, she was yelling and
I didn't even know who she was.

04:28.616 --> 04:30.139
I was so surprised to realize

04:30.182 --> 04:32.924
that she was the person
on the jury with me.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.840
But I never would've killed her.

04:35.884 --> 04:39.453
And you never met her
or spoke to her or knew her

04:39.496 --> 04:41.324
anywhere ever, before that?

04:41.368 --> 04:45.067
No. She was just
some random lady.

04:45.110 --> 04:47.156
Who died.
[moans]

04:47.199 --> 04:50.332
[exhales] This is just
so messed up and awful.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.553
Uh, you're a local celebrity,

04:52.596 --> 04:55.251
and that-that might put
the jury on your side,

04:55.295 --> 04:57.862
or it may turn public
opinion against you.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.342
I mean, people
love nothing more

04:59.386 --> 05:03.999
than a salacious story about
a fallen local celebrity.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.435
I was 18.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.655
I was Rose Festival Queen
for one year,

05:07.698 --> 05:11.223
and there have been
15 Rose Queens after me.

05:11.267 --> 05:14.052
I'm not a local celebrity.
I'm local history.

05:14.096 --> 05:16.968
[laughs softly]

05:17.012 --> 05:19.362
The evidence against you
is circumstantial.

05:19.406 --> 05:22.539
I believe that the police
made you the prime suspect

05:22.582 --> 05:24.541
because it was
the simplest solution.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.717
So a large component
of your defense

05:26.761 --> 05:29.198
is going to be pinpointing
an alternate suspect.

05:29.241 --> 05:32.288
You mean figuring out who
really killed juror number nine.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.463
Exactly.

05:36.031 --> 05:38.816
Oh, my God. Wow. Queen Amy.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.470
You're out.

05:40.514 --> 05:42.037
And about. You're here.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.257
Yeah, I'm allowed to leave
my house arrest cell

05:45.301 --> 05:46.650
to see my lawyer,

05:46.694 --> 05:48.739
Huh.thanks to this
stylish ankle monitor

05:48.783 --> 05:50.524
and the armed driver
waiting for me downstairs.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.656
Well, I'm Todd. I'm the
investigator on your case.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.615
I was actually a junior
in high school

05:54.658 --> 05:56.530
when you won
Rose Festival Queen.

05:56.573 --> 05:57.748
Were you at Jefferson with me?

05:57.792 --> 05:59.315
Uh, no, no, I was at Wilson.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.056
I mean, now it's Ida B. Wells,

06:01.099 --> 06:05.887
but yeah, I just remember
seeing it-- you, on TV.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.584
[chuckles]
Wilson.

06:07.628 --> 06:10.065
Oh, your Princess was Kelly.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.762
She was so sweet.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.285
So, if you're the investigator,

06:13.329 --> 06:16.027
um, does that mean that
there's any new information

06:16.071 --> 06:17.638
to know about?

06:17.681 --> 06:18.769
Any clues, suspects?

06:18.813 --> 06:20.945
Uh, no, not yet, but soon.

06:20.989 --> 06:23.426
We're-we're just starting
to look into it now.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.559
Uh, maybe this is weird,

06:25.602 --> 06:27.256
but could I give you my number?

06:27.299 --> 06:28.692
And then maybe
you could call me

06:28.736 --> 06:31.129
and you could update me
on any new developments?

06:31.173 --> 06:33.957
Otherwise I'm just gonna be
in my apartment obsessing.

06:34.002 --> 06:37.222
Sure. Um, yeah,
let me just, uh-- Here.

06:37.266 --> 06:39.399
Just put your number
in my phone.

06:40.878 --> 06:43.272
Unless your girlfriend
is gonna be upset to find

06:43.315 --> 06:44.578
some strange lady's
phone number in here.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.580
[chuckles]
Nope. Uh...

06:46.623 --> 06:47.798
No girlfriend.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.191
And no other Queens
in my phone, either.

06:49.234 --> 06:50.801
Except for Queen Elizabeth.

06:50.845 --> 06:52.020
But you know. RIP.

06:52.063 --> 06:54.849
And Freddie Mercury, of Queen,

06:54.892 --> 06:56.807
who was always changing
his number. And also...

06:56.851 --> 06:58.853
BOTH:
RIP. [laughter]

06:58.896 --> 07:00.855
My elevator's here. I got to go.Oh, yeah, yes, yes, go.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.295
[timer dings]

07:06.338 --> 07:07.514
Patty,

07:07.557 --> 07:10.691
how long are you
planning to stay?

07:10.734 --> 07:12.649
[chuckles]
Well, with a view like that,

07:12.693 --> 07:14.521
why would I ever leave?

07:14.564 --> 07:15.957
It's breathtaking.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.480
I can't imagine why Harry

07:17.524 --> 07:19.613
wouldn't have wanted
to live here.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.223
Okay, let's not talk
about things like that.

07:21.266 --> 07:23.225
Okay? Not now. Private things,

07:23.268 --> 07:24.879
on this visit,

07:24.922 --> 07:26.707
for once. All right.Oh.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.404
You're making a pie? Oh!

07:28.448 --> 07:29.579
You're holding up
your little pinkies

07:29.623 --> 07:31.494
like Mom did
when she baked.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.496
No, I'm not.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.237
You're not putting the cinnamon
in before the butter, right?

07:35.280 --> 07:36.717
Yes, Patty, I'm making
the family recipe.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.153
No, that's not the way
to do it, though.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.807
I actually wrote down
the family recipe.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.591
Oh, you wrote down the family
recipe in my handwriting?

07:41.635 --> 07:42.505
That's not your handwriting.It is my handwriting.

07:42.549 --> 07:43.985
That's me. I did...

07:44.028 --> 07:45.159
Don't put it in.
You don't put it in.I put it in.

07:45.203 --> 07:46.988
You have to...There, it went in.

07:47.031 --> 07:49.643
That's the family recipe, okay?
That's what I did.No...

07:49.686 --> 07:51.645
[doorbell rings]Ooh, the kids are here.

07:51.688 --> 07:53.560
PATTY: See?MARGARET:
Patty, it's fine. It's fine.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.779
Oh, Todd, I looked up
that poison you mentioned.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.694
What poison?I don't know what
other conversations

07:57.738 --> 07:59.740
you're having with other sisters
about poisons,

07:59.783 --> 08:01.219
Right.but the one that
you mentioned to me

08:01.263 --> 08:03.831
is actually
parloxid blutominide.

08:03.874 --> 08:06.747
And yes, the Rose Queen
could have made it herself

08:06.790 --> 08:09.010
using... common fertilizers

08:09.053 --> 08:11.839
and simple instructions
from the Internet.

08:11.882 --> 08:14.363
We do through this whole poison
treatment module in the ER,

08:14.406 --> 08:16.496
and that one
is particularly volatile

08:16.539 --> 08:18.454
and fugacious.Which means?

08:18.498 --> 08:20.369
Short-lived.Which means?

08:20.412 --> 08:21.544
If the delivery system is water,

08:21.588 --> 08:23.111
it's only potent
for about 60 minutes.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.461
Which means...What are we talking about?

08:26.723 --> 08:28.464
ALLISON:
Uh, the murder.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.291
The Rose Festival Queen thing.

08:29.334 --> 08:30.814
Ooh. Yeah.

08:30.858 --> 08:32.120
Okay. Well...

08:32.163 --> 08:33.948
Let's see, okay.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.820
So, the Rose Festival
is basically Portland's version

08:36.864 --> 08:39.126
of the Miss America pageant,
so every high school

08:39.169 --> 08:41.869
selects a senior
for their Rose Princess,

08:41.912 --> 08:44.174
then, at the festival,
a Queen is elected.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.569
She gets a scholarship,
she gets a whole new wardrobe...

08:46.613 --> 08:47.788
Uh, Patty,

08:47.831 --> 08:49.398
I-I know. I'm from here.

08:49.441 --> 08:50.834
Mm-hmm. You know, your
mother would have killed

08:50.878 --> 08:52.009
for you to have been
a Rose Princess.

08:52.053 --> 08:54.403
Never.Or to have been
one herself.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.361
But I guess this Rose Queen
really did kill somebody.

08:56.405 --> 08:59.495
Boy, she snapped
and beheaded a judge, was it?

08:59.539 --> 09:00.801
No one was beheaded, Patty.

09:00.844 --> 09:01.845
Oh, yeah, well, I think

09:01.889 --> 09:03.499
that's for the jury to decide.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.674
What are these?CHUCK:
These are the placemats.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.284
Those are-- No, those aren't.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.069
What do you mean?Those are not the
ones that we use.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.113
These are the ones
we always use.

09:09.157 --> 09:11.638
No, we never use those.Um...

09:11.681 --> 09:13.770
So, uh, what brings you
to town, Aunt Patty?

09:13.814 --> 09:16.381
Oh, well, there's
a ceremony for me.Oh.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.514
A little cocktail party.
I want you all to come.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.863
I donated
some money

09:19.907 --> 09:22.431
to a refugee organization
of sorts, and now

09:22.474 --> 09:25.173
they're dedicating a wing
of their building in my honor.

09:25.216 --> 09:27.567
And I just like to come in on,
you know, during springtime,

09:27.610 --> 09:29.003
when it's all colorful

09:29.046 --> 09:30.961
and there are flowers
and it's so pretty, you know.

09:31.005 --> 09:33.224
By this time next year
I'll be blind, so...

09:33.268 --> 09:34.704
I'm trying to soak it
all in while I can.

09:34.748 --> 09:37.620
What could have compelled
that sweet, poor little girl

09:37.664 --> 09:39.230
to execute somebody?

09:39.274 --> 09:40.928
Well, I don't think
she executed anyone.

09:40.971 --> 09:43.539
I don't think she did it.
She's very nice.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.193
Well, maybe she's a sociopath.

09:45.236 --> 09:46.716
Could've been
a thrill kill.Patty.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.588
Patty? Patty, Patty, Patty.Oh.

09:48.631 --> 09:51.591
She is my client,
and she did not murder anyone.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.897
Oh, well, I guess
we'll never know.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.507
Amy's a victim, Patty,

09:55.551 --> 09:57.466
and Irene was poisoned
by someone else.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.207
Or maybe she just up and died.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.513
You know, sometimes a death like
that can be very convenient.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.515
[chuckles]
Just ask your mother.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.302
[mouths]

10:08.782 --> 10:10.610
PATTY:
Night, Magpie.

10:15.527 --> 10:18.705
[inhales, grunts]

10:46.515 --> 10:48.691
All right, Lyle,
what do you have?

10:48.735 --> 10:50.388
Security camera footage,

10:50.432 --> 10:52.521
inside the courthouse showing
the bailiff delivering

10:52.564 --> 10:54.871
a sealed and wrapped
case of water

10:54.915 --> 10:57.569
to the jury room
at 6:02 a.m.

10:57.613 --> 10:58.788
One of those bottles was found

10:58.832 --> 11:00.529
under Irene's chair
containing the poison.

11:00.572 --> 11:02.313
And you, Todd? What do you have?

11:02.357 --> 11:04.315
A theory.Mm-hmm?

11:04.359 --> 11:06.013
Those water bottles
sat in that room, alone,

11:06.056 --> 11:09.190
for three hours until the jury
started coming in around 9:00.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.192
And Irene died at 9:27.

11:11.235 --> 11:15.022
So, if the poison
is only active for one hour,

11:15.065 --> 11:16.501
then all these
court employees,

11:16.545 --> 11:18.155
the stenographer,
the shampoo lawyers--

11:18.199 --> 11:19.504
who might have loved
a mistrial--

11:19.548 --> 11:21.202
are all off the hook.

11:21.245 --> 11:22.725
Because none of them
went into the jury room,

11:22.769 --> 11:24.509
none of them had access
to the bottles of water.

11:24.553 --> 11:25.902
Only one
of the jurors

11:25.946 --> 11:27.599
could have gotten that poison
into that bottle

11:27.643 --> 11:30.167
and into Irene's hands
in that slim half-hour window.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.866
You know what's bothering me?Hmm?

11:32.909 --> 11:34.824
There are roughly 803,000 people
in Multnomah County.

11:34.868 --> 11:37.044
796 were called
for jury duty that day,

11:37.087 --> 11:38.959
100 were sent to that courtroom,

11:39.002 --> 11:40.743
only 12 made it
into the jury box.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.527
But all these selections
are completely random

11:42.571 --> 11:44.138
and made by a computer.

11:44.181 --> 11:46.488
That's like the lottery,
which means...That the jury

11:46.531 --> 11:49.709
is most likely comprised
of 12 complete strangers.

11:49.752 --> 11:52.189
Or maybe one of them shows up,

11:52.233 --> 11:54.975
and-- surprise--
recognizes juror number nine,

11:55.018 --> 11:58.369
has some deep, dark, horrible,
secret connection to her

11:58.413 --> 12:00.502
and decides
to send her kersplitzo.

12:00.545 --> 12:01.416
Kersplitzo?

12:01.459 --> 12:02.591
We need to talk to these jurors.

12:02.634 --> 12:03.592
All 12 of them.

12:03.635 --> 12:04.854
I mean, nine. One is dead.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.726
I mean, nine is dead.
The number nine.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.249
And three is accused
of killing nine.

12:08.292 --> 12:09.554
Maybe seven ate nine.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.121
What I mean is,
what we really need to do--

12:11.165 --> 12:12.557
even though we don't
have enough time--

12:12.601 --> 12:15.343
is get the remaining ten in here
and interview them.

12:15.386 --> 12:16.692
Find out who they are,

12:16.736 --> 12:18.041
what they do,
what they think.

12:18.085 --> 12:19.869
Wait.

12:19.913 --> 12:22.045
We've already done that.

12:22.089 --> 12:24.265
The voir dire transcript.

12:24.308 --> 12:25.483
They were all
interviewed thoroughly

12:25.527 --> 12:27.137
during jury selection.

12:27.181 --> 12:28.182
If there's a
random connection

12:28.225 --> 12:30.488
between any of them,

12:30.532 --> 12:31.620
we'll find it here.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.405
Okay. Okay, okay.

12:34.449 --> 12:35.885
We're gonna need a bigger room.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.495
Okay.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.805
Good?Found some photos
of all the jurors,

12:42.849 --> 12:45.415
some of which I had to
pull from social media.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.635
All right, let's arrange them
in their order.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.115
One through six on top...

12:48.158 --> 12:49.986
[overlapping chatter]

12:50.030 --> 12:51.161
This is the best picture
you could find...

12:51.205 --> 12:53.337
It's not a beauty contest,
Francey.

12:53.381 --> 12:54.730
We're gonna solve a crime here.FRANCEY:
Can't even tell who that is.

12:54.774 --> 12:55.992
Careful with those.Why?

12:56.036 --> 12:56.819
Don't bend the corners.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.212
TODD:
I need eight...

12:58.255 --> 12:59.909
This is five. Here.This is five.

12:59.953 --> 13:01.519
Got it, got it, got it.

13:01.563 --> 13:02.912
Okay.All right.

13:02.956 --> 13:06.263
So, one of these jurors
is the real killer.

13:06.307 --> 13:08.483
My money's on the bee.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.441
âª

13:17.144 --> 13:20.147
Okay, first things first.
Irene is dead,

13:20.190 --> 13:22.366
and Amy is our client.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.978
And these four: Sven, Danielle,

13:25.021 --> 13:29.765
Kathy and Sal, never made it
into the jury room that morning.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.027
Sven and Kathy were late,

13:31.071 --> 13:32.681
Danielle and Sal were
talking to the judge,

13:32.724 --> 13:34.857
and none of them
got water bottles.Okay.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.251
TODD:
And then there were six.

13:37.294 --> 13:40.341
Okay. Somewhere in here

13:40.384 --> 13:43.431
is a connection between one
of them and our victim Irene.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.389
So let's get down to it.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.348
[papers thud]

13:47.391 --> 13:48.958
FRANCEY:
Irene was 71 years old,

13:49.002 --> 13:51.526
a former financial adviser
at Lehman Brothers.

13:51.569 --> 13:54.268
And she moved
from Pasadena to Portland

13:54.311 --> 13:56.096
three years ago to retire.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.490
TODD:
Okay, Sydney works for...

13:59.534 --> 14:00.752
Really? Murder Inc.?

14:00.796 --> 14:02.972
A role-playing
board game company?

14:03.016 --> 14:04.365
And she "loves it."

14:04.408 --> 14:06.715
MARGARET:
Zena does not use shampoo.

14:06.758 --> 14:09.587
And she tried like hell
to get out of jury duty.

14:09.631 --> 14:12.721
Not Lou. "Thrilled to be here"
and "Happy to serve."

14:12.764 --> 14:14.114
FRANCEY [mutters]:
One, two, three...

14:14.157 --> 14:15.463
MARGARET:
Rachel lives in Dunthorpe,

14:15.506 --> 14:18.031
"distrusts
financial institutions"

14:18.074 --> 14:20.381
as a result
of some "bad investments."

14:20.424 --> 14:22.774
Possibly by Lehman Brothers.
Possible connection.

14:22.818 --> 14:25.168
FRANCEY:
Okay, and the bumblebee,
he does use shampoo.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.823
but he wanted to make sure
he was "done with jury duty

14:27.867 --> 14:30.173
in time to make
the big Ducks game."

14:30.217 --> 14:32.567
He went to U of O,
just like Irene.

14:32.610 --> 14:34.134
Another connection.

14:34.177 --> 14:36.963
[indistinct chatter]

14:37.006 --> 14:39.835
LYLE:
Hold on. This Cole looks
too young to be on jury duty.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.924
Aha, that's exactly
what he wants you to think.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.404
Did you see the part
where he says he reads

14:43.447 --> 14:46.233
The Wall Street Journal
every day? Baloney.

14:46.276 --> 14:47.974
No one does that.Irene did.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.193
Put it on the board.

14:50.237 --> 14:52.326
MARGARET:
All right.

14:52.369 --> 14:56.765
It is time to bring these six in

14:56.808 --> 14:59.028
and ask them some questions.

15:01.509 --> 15:02.814
TODD:
Since Irene was poisoned,

15:02.858 --> 15:04.033
do we really think
it's the best idea

15:04.077 --> 15:05.600
to be serving them
powdered donuts?

15:05.643 --> 15:07.602
I mean, hasn't anyone
read Flowers in the Attic?

15:07.645 --> 15:08.995
FRANCEY:
Where are the other two?

15:09.038 --> 15:10.257
MARGARET:
I could only track down
these four.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.649
Okay, we are gonna
bring them in,

15:11.693 --> 15:12.955
one by one, for questioning.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.217
Then I want you
to hold them here

15:14.261 --> 15:16.393
so that I can bring them
back in for follow-up--

15:16.437 --> 15:18.700
Oh, my God, give me a second.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.963
[chuckles]: Uh, Patty.
My sister Patty.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.139
Patty, what are you doing here?

15:23.183 --> 15:24.706
I thought we were having lunch?
Are you too busy?

15:24.749 --> 15:26.664
Don't worry, I can
make myself scarce until...

15:28.231 --> 15:29.972
Hello.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.453
So you're the murderers.
That's exciting.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.324
Is that a green-crested
cockatoo in that cage?

15:34.368 --> 15:36.674
Very distinctive coo.[bird chirping]

15:36.718 --> 15:38.502
I studied ornithology.

15:38.546 --> 15:41.331
Well, me and Vanilla Ice
are on the way to the vet,

15:41.375 --> 15:43.290
but I'm happy to
help. H-How can I?

15:43.333 --> 15:44.639
MARGARET:
Mr. Briggs,
during voir dire,

15:44.682 --> 15:48.643
did you speak to juror
number nine Irene at all?

15:48.686 --> 15:51.559
No. Didn't say two words
to each other.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.909
She seemed nice, though.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.606
Now, what does, uh,
"voir dire" mean again?

15:55.650 --> 15:58.131
Oh, it's French.
It means "To speak the truth."

15:58.174 --> 16:00.133
TODD:
And, uh, Lou,

16:00.176 --> 16:03.440
on the day she died, how did you
get your water bottle?

16:03.484 --> 16:05.965
Oh, I... I don't remember. Uh...

16:06.008 --> 16:07.140
Somebody handed it to me,
I guess.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.619
MARGARET:
And Blake,

16:08.663 --> 16:10.882
do you remember if you drank
from your bottle of water?

16:10.926 --> 16:13.885
I mean, does it matter? You
know, did I even have a water?

16:13.929 --> 16:15.539
I'm pretty hydrated, brah.
[chuckles]

16:15.583 --> 16:18.542
Uh, yes. You went to U of O,

16:18.586 --> 16:21.197
as did Irene, 40 years earlier.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.025
Who's Irene?

16:23.069 --> 16:24.592
The juror who died?

16:24.635 --> 16:26.768
Uh, did you ever
run into her

16:26.811 --> 16:28.509
at any alumni events?

16:28.552 --> 16:30.859
Are you sure that was her name?
The old chick?

16:30.902 --> 16:32.078
Irene?

16:32.121 --> 16:33.383
As for alumni events: maybe?

16:33.427 --> 16:34.819
I'm usually
pretty hammered at those.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.386
All right, Bryce.It's Blake.

16:36.430 --> 16:37.997
Same thing.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.694
So, Cole,

16:39.737 --> 16:41.391
where do you live?

16:41.435 --> 16:43.741
Um, Hillsdale area.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.613
Hmm. And, Cole,
do you live alone?

16:45.656 --> 16:48.355
Uh, no. I actually live
with this lovely older couple.

16:48.398 --> 16:49.573
Jean and Peter.

16:49.617 --> 16:52.141
Ah, Jean and Peter Winbar?
Your parents?

16:53.664 --> 16:57.277
Cole, I-I don't think I actually
believe that you are 18.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.802
Um, okay, so...

17:00.845 --> 17:04.109
I may have lied about my age
so I could get a fake I.D.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.329
and vote.Oh.

17:06.373 --> 17:08.288
I-I didn't know they were
gonna give me jury duty.

17:08.330 --> 17:11.160
W-Where do your parents
think you are right now?

17:11.204 --> 17:13.162
A-Algebra?Okay.

17:13.205 --> 17:14.729
Okay, so you're the detective.

17:14.771 --> 17:16.731
And you're the lawyer.

17:16.773 --> 17:18.340
Like good cop, bad cop?
I love it.

17:18.385 --> 17:19.951
I love murder.
I mean, all crime, really.

17:19.994 --> 17:21.779
Oh, my God, I'm so excited.
Are we gonna recreate the crime?

17:21.823 --> 17:23.128
Because I brought
the clothes I was wearing.

17:23.172 --> 17:25.957
Uh, hey, Sydney,
that really wasn't necessary.

17:26.001 --> 17:27.394
Is this gonna be on PDX Files?

17:27.436 --> 17:29.309
Is Lea Luna here?

17:29.352 --> 17:31.311
I have not had one sip of water
since it happened.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.574
Hello?
Flavorless poison.

17:33.617 --> 17:35.228
Okay, motive-wise,
what are your thoughts?

17:35.271 --> 17:36.751
I have some theories.
It's either a sex crime

17:36.794 --> 17:38.187
or someone has a twin.

17:38.231 --> 17:41.538
Okay, okay. Sydney?
Sydney, did you talk to Irene?

17:41.582 --> 17:43.149
Ah. Okay.

17:43.192 --> 17:45.673
Crafting an alternate theory.

17:45.716 --> 17:46.978
But alas, no.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.719
I was taking notes.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.156
All right.
Who's your front-runner?

17:50.199 --> 17:51.505
I think...O-Okay, Sydney.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.289
Thank you, but you can go now.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.074
What about my blood
and my saliva samples?

17:55.117 --> 17:57.032
What about my fingerprints?

17:57.076 --> 17:59.252
Aren't we lie detector-ing?

17:59.295 --> 18:00.340
Thank you, Sydney.
We don't do that here.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.081
This is Margaret Wright's
office.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.257
Ah. Yes.The glass was my idea.
She wanted brick.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.476
There's asbestos
in the ceiling.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.782
AMY [over phone]:
Hey.Hey.

18:07.825 --> 18:09.131
What's happening?
What's the latest?

18:09.175 --> 18:10.350
Uh, well,
we're still interviewing

18:10.393 --> 18:11.612
alternative suspects.

18:11.655 --> 18:13.570
But my mom wanted to ask
if you remembered

18:13.614 --> 18:16.443
anything in particular about
juror number seven? Blake?

18:16.486 --> 18:19.054
Oh, the bro-ey frat guy?Yeah.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.752
No. He hit on me,
but, like, in a bored way.

18:21.796 --> 18:24.581
I don't think that he'd be
smart enough to...

18:24.625 --> 18:27.628
Yeah, yeah, I don't think so,
either. [chuckles]

18:27.671 --> 18:30.326
But, um, h-how are you doing?

18:30.370 --> 18:32.067
Do you need anything?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.287
[sighs]
Well, DoorDash won't deliver

18:34.330 --> 18:36.724
because my account was hacked,

18:36.767 --> 18:39.335
and somebody had $300 worth
of pizza on me.

18:39.379 --> 18:40.380
Yikes.

18:40.423 --> 18:42.033
So I'm eating all my outdated

18:42.077 --> 18:43.905
pandemic canned fish.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.124
Hmm.

18:45.167 --> 18:48.562
Well, have you heard
of Todd Dash?

18:49.563 --> 18:51.347
[both chuckle]

18:53.349 --> 18:55.395
Yeah, Amy's not convinced
it's the bee.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.223
And in my humble opinion,

18:57.266 --> 18:59.225
I don't think it's Birdman,
Young Angela Lansbury

18:59.268 --> 19:00.791
or the Boy Wonder.

19:00.835 --> 19:04.317
Uh-huh. Well, I'm more concerned
about these two no-shows.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.101
Rachel and Zena.FRANCEY:Yeah.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.015
They didn't even bother
calling me back.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.538
But I keep thinking about this

19:08.582 --> 19:11.585
Rachel/financial
investment connection.

19:11.628 --> 19:13.326
Yeah, what if she lost money
through Lehman Brothers?

19:13.369 --> 19:15.023
What if she knew Irene?

19:15.066 --> 19:17.112
Maybe we should pay
a visit to Rachel

19:17.156 --> 19:19.636
at 3710 Military Road?

19:19.680 --> 19:22.509
Todd, jacket.
Francey, I'll be right back.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.206
Wait, you're gonna leave me
here with your sister?Y-Yeah, no...

19:24.250 --> 19:27.122
No, seriously? Margaret?
No, Margaret.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.341
[sighs]

19:32.214 --> 19:36.349
Pretty sure we had a VW bus
tailing us on the way over here.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.002
It's gone now, though.

19:38.046 --> 19:41.789
Well, Rachel has never been
part of a class action lawsuit,

19:41.832 --> 19:43.660
and she does not trust
corporations.

19:43.704 --> 19:45.532
Oh, they always say that
to get out of jury duty.

19:45.575 --> 19:46.794
Hmm.

19:49.057 --> 19:51.799
Hey, what did Aunt Patty mean
the other night

19:51.842 --> 19:54.976
when she said that sometimes
death could be convenient?

19:55.019 --> 19:56.369
[coughs]

19:56.412 --> 19:57.935
Mom?

19:57.979 --> 19:59.981
Ugh...
[mutters]

20:00.024 --> 20:02.723
Do you remember when she told us
that the-the easiest way

20:02.766 --> 20:05.247
to dispose of our Christmas tree
was to eat it?

20:05.291 --> 20:06.901
I mean, she's bonkers.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.773
She makes my skin crawl.

20:09.817 --> 20:10.687
Why?

20:12.515 --> 20:15.301
Why do any siblings
not get along?

20:15.344 --> 20:16.954
I mean, i-it can be awful

20:16.998 --> 20:18.826
having someone trailing you
through life

20:18.869 --> 20:21.220
and keeping tabs on you and...

20:21.263 --> 20:23.613
and remembering
your every mistake.

20:23.657 --> 20:26.007
It's like you and Lawrence.
Y-You just don't get along.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.487
Whoa. There she is.

20:30.751 --> 20:33.580
Mommy!
Hi. Oh.

20:33.623 --> 20:35.495
Okay. Let's go.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.932
MARGARET:
Hi. I'm Margaret WrightHi.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.194
from Crest, Folding & Song.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.804
Actually, it's just
Crest & Folding now.

20:40.848 --> 20:43.198
And this is my private
investigator Todd Wright.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.852
Same last name. I'm her father.

20:44.895 --> 20:47.333
Oh, yeah, I got your message,
I've just been really busy.

20:47.376 --> 20:48.812
I'll call and get
something scheduled.

20:48.856 --> 20:51.119
Wai-- Or-or you could
just tell us right now

20:51.162 --> 20:52.729
if you ever lost any money
through Lehman Brothers

20:52.773 --> 20:55.471
or knew Irene Kimpton before?

20:55.515 --> 20:57.168
MAN:
Honey, who is that?

20:57.212 --> 20:59.301
I really can't talk.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.303
I can't.
Wait.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.699
Uh, go get the car.
Go get the car.

21:06.787 --> 21:09.442
So, not suspicious at all, huh?

21:09.485 --> 21:12.009
We may have to subpoena
her financial records

21:12.053 --> 21:15.404
and bank account statements,
all of it.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.450
Wait a minute.

21:17.493 --> 21:18.842
Where is she going?

21:18.886 --> 21:20.714
Todd? Oh, Todd,
she's getting away.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.281
She's getting away.
What are we gonna do?

21:22.324 --> 21:23.847
Okay, let's calm down. I snuck
got my little friend the tNAB

21:23.891 --> 21:28.112
into her bumper, and looks
like she's headed south.

21:28.156 --> 21:30.854
Ooh, Todd, I could kiss you.

21:30.898 --> 21:32.334
Well, I'd rather you drive.

21:36.904 --> 21:38.514
Mommy!

21:39.776 --> 21:41.778
âª

21:46.000 --> 21:48.568
Does Rachel have two families?

21:54.791 --> 21:56.576
Yes, I have two families.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.099
You don't know how difficult
this is,

21:58.142 --> 22:00.014
what a fine line I'm walking.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.059
I fell in love with Thad,

22:02.103 --> 22:03.539
and then I found Bryce
and his son.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.324
That is confusing.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.325
Do you have any idea
how many stories

22:06.368 --> 22:07.326
I have to keep straight?

22:07.369 --> 22:08.762
I can imagine.

22:08.805 --> 22:10.459
I don't have time
to murder anyone.

22:10.503 --> 22:13.201
And Irene and I were friendly.

22:13.244 --> 22:15.334
We laughed about the whole
investment connection.

22:15.377 --> 22:16.770
She lost money, too.

22:16.813 --> 22:19.512
Look, we even took
a selfie together.

22:19.555 --> 22:20.948
My second husband
got suspicious,

22:20.991 --> 22:23.254
so I sent him this to prove
that I was on jury duty.

22:23.298 --> 22:24.473
Question: how do you decide
which husband

22:24.517 --> 22:25.822
to call your second?

22:25.866 --> 22:26.823
MARGARET: Um...TODD: Ow.

22:26.867 --> 22:27.998
Can you please
send me that photo?

22:28.042 --> 22:29.565
You can just email it to...

22:29.609 --> 22:32.089
I'll AirDrop it to you, but
then you really have to leave.

22:32.133 --> 22:34.353
Oh, my goodness.
How did you do that?

22:34.396 --> 22:35.484
TODD:
Mom?

22:35.528 --> 22:37.878
Ten years old, this technology.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.445
Why don't you, uh,
send me that photo?

22:39.488 --> 22:42.317
Oh, of course. Let me
just AirPlop it to you.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.711
AirDrop, Mom.

22:44.754 --> 22:48.758
Wait. You're not "Sleuthy
McSleutherson," are you?

22:48.802 --> 22:50.456
What? No. Are you kidding me?

22:50.499 --> 22:51.935
Well, then-then, who is that?

22:51.979 --> 22:53.197
It's right there
on my phone. Look.

22:53.241 --> 22:55.199
I don't know.
It must be someone else nearby.

22:55.243 --> 22:56.766
Wait, Mom, look.

22:56.810 --> 22:58.115
Oh, my God.

22:58.159 --> 23:00.291
Someone isfollowing us.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.556
Sleuthy.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.690
Ah. Good morning.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.562
You caught me.
I've been following you all day.

23:09.605 --> 23:10.998
I put a tNAB on your car.

23:11.041 --> 23:12.216
What? Hey, that's my thing.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.522
SYDNEY:
It's all for my investigation.

23:13.566 --> 23:14.828
Your investigation?

23:14.871 --> 23:15.916
Do you know how long
I have waited

23:15.959 --> 23:17.396
to be involved in a murder?

23:17.439 --> 23:19.789
And then it just happened.
Someone died near me.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.009
I'm famous. I'll have a podcast.

23:22.052 --> 23:23.924
People will dress as me
for Halloween.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.186
Oh, Sydney,
you have to stop this.

23:25.229 --> 23:26.187
This could be very dangerous.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.188
And I know
who it is.

23:27.231 --> 23:28.363
It's Rachel. She's a liar.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.060
Two families? And
she hated Irene.

23:30.104 --> 23:31.235
Okay, I see what you're saying
about the liar aspect,

23:31.279 --> 23:32.976
but do you think
that automatically

23:33.020 --> 23:34.282
makes her a murderer?

23:34.325 --> 23:36.110
I mean, that might
just be a red herring.

23:36.153 --> 23:37.372
Plus, I think that-- Sorry.Todd, Todd.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.808
Irene and Rachel
were apparently fine.

23:38.852 --> 23:41.202
Look, they took
this photo together.

23:41.245 --> 23:43.291
Uh, oh, my God.

23:43.334 --> 23:45.424
What?Oh, oh, my God. That-That's it.

23:45.467 --> 23:46.729
What? W-What? What do you see?

23:46.773 --> 23:48.644
No. I call this. This is mine.

23:48.688 --> 23:51.038
[stammers] Ow!No, no, no. Goodbye.
I've got to go!

23:52.431 --> 23:54.084
[tires screeching]

23:56.870 --> 23:59.307
Do we go after her, or...

23:59.350 --> 24:01.744
MARGARET:
What did she see in this photo?

24:01.788 --> 24:04.181
TODD:
This is Aunt Patty's
charity event?

24:04.225 --> 24:06.488
WOMAN:
Thank you so much for coming.

24:06.532 --> 24:09.709
We are delighted to honor
one individual...

24:09.752 --> 24:12.494
Patty.
I'm the honoree this evening.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.061
WOMAN:
Enjoy the food and drink.

24:14.104 --> 24:16.585
All 97% cruelty free.

24:16.629 --> 24:18.718
[applause]Okay, so the refugees

24:18.761 --> 24:21.155
that Aunt Patty is
helping are rabbits?

24:21.198 --> 24:22.678
They're rabbit refugees.

24:22.722 --> 24:25.507
And what about this food and
drink is three percent cruel?

24:25.551 --> 24:27.378
Isn't this fun?
BOTH:
Mm.

24:27.422 --> 24:29.772
I'm so glad you're here.

24:29.816 --> 24:32.558
Whew. I haven't had hard cider
in decades.

24:33.646 --> 24:35.561
Hey, um, Aunt Patty,

24:35.604 --> 24:37.258
Todd and I
were talking.Mm-hmm?

24:37.301 --> 24:38.607
What did you mean
the other night

24:38.651 --> 24:40.435
when you said that
"death can be convenient"?

24:40.479 --> 24:42.524
TODD:
Yeah, a-and then
you said, uh,

24:42.568 --> 24:44.308
"Ask your Mom."Yeah.

24:44.352 --> 24:46.485
Oh, that. Well, y-you know.

24:46.528 --> 24:48.487
Your mother
and your father Oswald.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.314
Ages ago.

24:50.358 --> 24:52.578
Uh, she didn't have
to leave him because he died.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.625
Wait, Aunt Patty.Mm-hmm?

24:56.669 --> 24:59.193
Our mom was gonna leave our dad?

24:59.236 --> 25:02.283
Yes, she was miserable.
Like Allison.

25:02.326 --> 25:03.806
I mean, Chuck is sweet,

25:03.850 --> 25:05.982
but we can all tell
you're unhappy, sweetie.

25:06.026 --> 25:07.636
Your mother was
in a similar predicament.

25:07.680 --> 25:10.465
She put some plans
into motion, but then...

25:10.509 --> 25:12.249
[imitates choking]Patty.

25:12.293 --> 25:13.947
What are you
talking about?

25:13.990 --> 25:15.557
[applause]Oh, here it is. This is me.
This is the plaque.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.646
WOMAN:
And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

25:18.734 --> 25:20.040
PATTY:
"Augie Norman"?

25:20.083 --> 25:21.824
That's not my name. Wait.

25:21.868 --> 25:23.652
Wait, I know.

25:23.696 --> 25:27.743
I think I donated that money
to the wild hawk rescue.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.310
Don't hawks eat rabbits?

25:29.353 --> 25:31.094
Oh, yeah.
[chuckles]

25:31.138 --> 25:33.575
This is just a room
full of crazy rabbit people.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.490
Hello.Okay. Let's go.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.971
Yeah.My good word, what
were you thinking?

25:38.014 --> 25:39.886
[overlapping chatter]

25:43.367 --> 25:46.327
I can't tell you
how good this is.

25:46.370 --> 25:47.546
Thank you so much.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.636
Hey. Are you okay?

25:50.679 --> 25:53.595
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
It's just, um...

25:53.639 --> 25:55.075
Long day searching
for the real killer?

25:55.118 --> 25:57.120
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

25:57.164 --> 26:01.603
And, um, I-I know we don't know
each other very well, but...

26:01.647 --> 26:04.388
earlier tonight,
I got this weird info

26:04.432 --> 26:06.347
about my parents' marriage,

26:06.390 --> 26:07.696
back when my dad died.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.132
Oh, wow.

26:09.176 --> 26:10.394
Yeah.I'm so sorry.

26:10.438 --> 26:12.222
No.Um, do you, um...

26:12.266 --> 26:13.484
Do you need to talk?

26:16.400 --> 26:18.315
How old were you?

26:18.359 --> 26:19.534
When h-he...

26:19.578 --> 26:21.492
Fourteen.

26:21.536 --> 26:24.147
He was a doctor.

26:24.191 --> 26:26.497
He went to a medical conference
in San Francisco

26:26.541 --> 26:28.543
and he had a heart attack.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.110
Yeah.

26:30.153 --> 26:31.415
My brother and sister
were both in college,

26:31.459 --> 26:34.854
so my mom and I were home alone.

26:34.897 --> 26:37.857
Together. Not dealing with it.

26:37.900 --> 26:40.990
And now you find out there's
this whole other backstory?

26:41.034 --> 26:42.992
Yeah.

26:43.036 --> 26:45.647
And she was...

26:45.691 --> 26:47.301
she wanted to leave him.

26:47.344 --> 26:50.173
Or I guess, she was leaving him.

26:50.217 --> 26:54.221
Well, hey, I don't mean
to talk about me

26:54.264 --> 26:56.266
when we're talking
about you... [chuckles]

26:56.310 --> 26:57.703
...but I-I do think
I kind of know how you feel.

26:57.746 --> 26:59.095
You do?

26:59.139 --> 27:01.750
Yeah. My mom was...

27:01.794 --> 27:04.579
S-She screwed over
my dad pretty bad.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.015
Mm-hmm.Cheated on him,

27:06.059 --> 27:09.062
made us lie in family court
to get custody.

27:09.105 --> 27:11.107
It was so ugly.

27:11.151 --> 27:13.240
Mm.She was always
good to me, though.

27:13.283 --> 27:15.764
You know, supporting me,
wanting me to succeed.

27:15.808 --> 27:18.158
She really wanted me
to do Rose Festival,

27:18.201 --> 27:20.726
'cause of the college
scholarship and everything.

27:20.769 --> 27:24.773
But I also think I knew that...

27:24.817 --> 27:26.949
inside, she was a...

27:26.993 --> 27:28.821
a bad person.

27:30.257 --> 27:31.737
Huh.

27:31.780 --> 27:34.130
I don't think my mom was bad.

27:34.174 --> 27:36.219
Well, was she good to you?

27:37.307 --> 27:39.135
Yeah.

27:39.179 --> 27:40.963
[phone ringing]Hold on one second.

27:41.007 --> 27:43.226
Hey, Mom.MARGARET [over phone]: Todd.

27:43.270 --> 27:45.489
Someone needs to check
on Amy immediately.

27:45.533 --> 27:46.839
I'm-I'm fairly sure
I know where she is,

27:46.882 --> 27:48.231
but why, what's going on?

27:48.275 --> 27:49.798
The police think someone

27:49.842 --> 27:52.018
may be knocking the jurors off
one by one.

27:52.061 --> 27:54.803
Wait, what?
Why would they think that?

27:54.847 --> 27:58.372
Because Sydney, that juror
who was following us today--

27:58.415 --> 28:00.983
Sleuthy McSleutherson--
she's dead.

28:01.027 --> 28:02.942
They strangled her.

28:12.212 --> 28:13.343
Todd, Todd. Come here.
Look at this.

28:13.387 --> 28:14.867
Uh-huh.Sydney sent me this photo

28:14.910 --> 28:16.085
right before her death.

28:16.129 --> 28:17.173
What is this? What was she...

28:17.217 --> 28:18.958
I think this photo
got her killed.

28:19.001 --> 28:20.916
Look closely.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.526
Right there.
Look at the gloves.

28:22.570 --> 28:24.137
Now pull up the, uh, picture
that Rachel gave you.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.704
Rachel?Uh-huh.

28:25.747 --> 28:28.619
Wait a second. Are those
the same black gloves?

28:28.663 --> 28:29.795
Mm-hmm.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.884
Sydney got all excited
about gloves?

28:31.927 --> 28:34.147
Because gloves don't leave
fingerprints on water bottles.

28:34.190 --> 28:36.192
And the real killer
put the poison in

28:36.236 --> 28:38.412
and never left a trace.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.153
Uh, where's that
security camera footage

28:40.196 --> 28:41.589
from the courthouse hallway?

28:42.677 --> 28:44.374
MARGARET:
Okay, Rachel and Cole.

28:44.418 --> 28:45.811
Clearly no gloves.

28:45.854 --> 28:47.203
That eliminates them.Mm-hmm.

28:47.247 --> 28:48.727
LYLE:
Yes, but Lou, Amy and Blake,

28:48.770 --> 28:50.250
their hands aren't visible,

28:50.293 --> 28:52.295
which puts them
in the unknown category.

28:52.339 --> 28:54.515
TODD:
Hey-hey, look-look,
freeze, freeze.

28:54.558 --> 28:56.430
Stop. Zoom in.

28:56.473 --> 28:59.085
Gloves. Black gloves.

28:59.128 --> 29:01.174
We have been trying to reach
Zena for three days now.

29:01.217 --> 29:03.872
I'm gonna see if Francey
has located her yet.

29:03.916 --> 29:05.091
Zena. I knew it.

29:05.134 --> 29:06.309
You said it was the bee.

29:07.963 --> 29:10.705
Zena is in Madagascar.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.228
Madagascar?
Mm-hmm.

29:12.272 --> 29:14.840
Madagascar, "the island
off of Africa" Madagascar?

29:14.883 --> 29:17.277
Her sister confirmed she left
yesterday on a 6:00 a.m. flight.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.018
And Sydney was murdered
the night before.

29:19.061 --> 29:20.671
Someone wanted to get
out of town fast.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.891
To a country that has
no extradition policy

29:22.935 --> 29:24.545
with the U.S.Exactly.

29:24.588 --> 29:26.721
By the way,
your sister's here again.

29:26.765 --> 29:27.940
She's waiting for you.

29:36.252 --> 29:38.037
[exhales]

29:38.080 --> 29:41.040
That wasn't your story to tell.

29:43.172 --> 29:45.871
All right, okay.
I know. I'm sorry.

29:45.914 --> 29:49.570
I just assumed
that they already knew.

29:49.613 --> 29:51.093
I mean, how...It's my family.

29:51.137 --> 29:54.053
My children. My story.

29:56.882 --> 29:59.232
But you were planning
on telling them someday.

29:59.275 --> 30:00.494
Right?

30:00.537 --> 30:03.323
Weren't you?

30:03.366 --> 30:04.759
Margaret.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.369
They're all in their 30s now.

30:06.413 --> 30:08.197
Isn't Lawrence turning 40 soon?

30:08.241 --> 30:09.503
Isn't it time?

30:09.546 --> 30:10.939
[moans]

30:16.945 --> 30:21.689
They should really hear it--
what really happened-- from you.

30:23.256 --> 30:25.954
I don't know.
Patty, I-I don't know.

30:33.657 --> 30:35.746
Oh-- Did-did you want
Mom's ring back?

30:35.790 --> 30:38.053
[laughs]:
No. No. No.

30:38.097 --> 30:39.750
You keep it.

30:41.752 --> 30:43.145
It makes your hand
look enormous.

30:48.716 --> 30:50.413
[sighs]

30:54.504 --> 30:58.682
I just can't believe
this is happening.

30:58.726 --> 31:01.729
I know, but we're on it.

31:01.772 --> 31:03.949
Do you have any leads?Oh, I can't really
talk to you...

31:03.992 --> 31:06.690
Todd, come on. This is my case.

31:06.734 --> 31:07.866
You're actually a witness
on ourcase.

31:07.909 --> 31:08.910
Are you really gonna
be like that?

31:08.954 --> 31:10.999
Like what?Just tell me,

31:11.043 --> 31:12.218
do they think that Amy did it?

31:12.261 --> 31:13.567
The second murder?

31:13.610 --> 31:15.961
Uh, no.

31:16.004 --> 31:18.659
And she does have an alibi
for last night. Ish. So...

31:18.702 --> 31:21.270
Ish? Is it a solid alibi?

31:21.314 --> 31:24.665
Uh, yeah. I mean, pretty solid.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.667
She was with me

31:26.710 --> 31:27.929
when I found out, and...

31:27.973 --> 31:29.888
Well, why were you
with her at that hour?

31:31.541 --> 31:33.413
Oh, my God. Todd.

31:33.456 --> 31:35.850
What?She is your client.
That is highly unethical.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.330
You violated
a whole string of...

31:37.373 --> 31:40.028
Uh, I don't think you get
to talk to me about ethics.

31:40.072 --> 31:41.247
Is it ethical for you to kiss me

31:41.290 --> 31:42.422
and then spend two weeks
gaslighting me

31:42.465 --> 31:43.727
into thinking
it never happened, Susan?

31:43.771 --> 31:45.991
That is not what I did.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.775
Is it not?

31:47.818 --> 31:49.951
MARGARET [distant]:
Todd! Todd!

31:49.995 --> 31:51.344
Gaslighting.MARGARET: Todd!

31:51.387 --> 31:53.999
Todd. Todd, good news.

31:54.042 --> 31:55.739
Susan, where
are you going?

31:55.783 --> 31:57.741
Turn on the TV.
Turn on the TV. Todd!

31:57.785 --> 31:59.700
Oh, careful. Francey, careful.

31:59.743 --> 32:01.267
We've reached Zena.She's connecting right now

32:01.310 --> 32:03.878
on a video call
from Madagascar.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.098
Hi. Zena Mitchell?
I'm Margaret Wright.

32:06.141 --> 32:07.969
Uh, can you, can you hear me?

32:08.013 --> 32:09.797
Hi. Yes, I-I'm here.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.713
Your assistant said you wanted
to talk about my gloves?

32:12.756 --> 32:15.542
Yes! Yes, yes, yes. The gloves,
the ones you wore to court.

32:15.585 --> 32:19.676
Uh... I think
I may have them with me.

32:23.158 --> 32:24.333
These gloves?

32:24.377 --> 32:26.640
Damn it. They're purple.

32:26.683 --> 32:27.989
Why are you in Madagascar?

32:28.033 --> 32:30.078
The jury was released.

32:30.122 --> 32:32.515
I'm volunteering
on a clean water project.MARGARET: Zena,

32:32.559 --> 32:34.169
do you remember anything

32:34.213 --> 32:37.085
about black gloves
on any jury member?

32:37.129 --> 32:38.826
No, I-I don't think so.MARGARET: Darn it!

32:38.869 --> 32:40.306
Okay. Um, Zena.

32:40.349 --> 32:43.178
This is our juror's box.

32:43.222 --> 32:45.572
You were sitting
right next to the accused, Amy,

32:45.615 --> 32:47.748
who was right behind
the victim Irene.

32:47.791 --> 32:50.533
You must have seen something.

32:50.577 --> 32:53.319
Okay. Look.

32:53.362 --> 32:54.711
I'm you. Okay?

32:54.755 --> 32:57.671
And you were sitting right here.

32:57.714 --> 33:00.282
Okay? Uh, Todd, uh, sit down
in chair number nine.

33:00.326 --> 33:01.718
Wait, so I'm Irene? Really?

33:01.762 --> 33:04.025
I feel more like I'm more
of a Sal or even a Cole.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.767
Okay, yeah. Put the water bottle
under your chair and...

33:11.076 --> 33:12.207
Wait.

33:12.251 --> 33:14.166
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:16.733 --> 33:19.040
Zena.

33:19.084 --> 33:23.349
On the day that you came in,
you had to walk

33:23.392 --> 33:25.177
right past Amy's chair.

33:25.220 --> 33:27.222
Is there any chance
that you could have

33:27.266 --> 33:30.965
accidentally knocked
the water bottle over?

33:32.836 --> 33:34.621
Wait, I think I did
knock somebody's water over.

33:34.664 --> 33:37.624
It fell right in front of us,
but I picked it back up.

33:37.667 --> 33:38.538
Oh, my God.

33:38.581 --> 33:40.061
Okay, so Zena

33:40.105 --> 33:42.977
accidentally switched
the bottles?

33:43.021 --> 33:45.371
Amy's not the killer.MARGARET:
No.

33:45.414 --> 33:48.983
Amy was the intended victim.

33:53.422 --> 33:54.728
Someone was trying to kill Amy.

33:54.771 --> 33:56.860
We've been looking
at these transcripts all wrong.

33:56.904 --> 33:58.732
Not Irene?
Nope. Amy.

33:58.775 --> 33:59.950
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

33:59.994 --> 34:03.084
At the very first start,
the first day...

34:03.128 --> 34:04.346
Um...

34:04.390 --> 34:06.348
Yes. Did we look back at this?

34:06.392 --> 34:08.481
The judge asks to speak
to "the two jurors

34:08.524 --> 34:11.223
who have vacation plans
that would interrupt jury duty."

34:11.266 --> 34:15.705
Zena, Madagascar,
and... Lou, the bird man.

34:15.748 --> 34:17.011
They were both
trying to get out of...

34:17.054 --> 34:18.795
No, no, no. 'Cause r-remember,

34:18.839 --> 34:21.275
Lou said that he was
"Thrilled to be here"

34:21.320 --> 34:23.061
and "Happy to serve." See?

34:23.103 --> 34:24.453
Why did he change his mind?

34:24.496 --> 34:26.411
Because Lou was juror number 12.

34:26.455 --> 34:27.848
The last one questioned.

34:27.891 --> 34:30.851
Before voir dire, he says
he has a planned vacation.

34:30.893 --> 34:34.333
He wants out, then after
everybody else has spoken,

34:34.376 --> 34:37.292
suddenly, he says no,
he wants to be there.

34:37.335 --> 34:40.600
Somebody before him

34:40.643 --> 34:42.123
must have said something

34:42.167 --> 34:43.297
to change his mind.

34:43.342 --> 34:45.170
Amy.

34:45.213 --> 34:47.259
We need to talk
to Lou again now.

34:47.302 --> 34:49.130
TODD:
Lou doesn't seem
like some maniac

34:49.174 --> 34:51.697
or a deranged serial killer,
did he?

34:51.741 --> 34:53.438
I mean, would he kill
two people?

34:53.482 --> 34:54.657
[doorbell rings]

34:56.659 --> 34:58.226
Todd.Hmm?

34:58.270 --> 34:59.967
Look. It's the
same table

35:00.010 --> 35:03.710
and chair as from the photo
that Sydney sent us.

35:03.753 --> 35:07.017
She was here.
I don't see the gloves, though.

35:07.061 --> 35:09.846
Okay, so,
maybe Lou is not a maniac.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.239
He's just scared.

35:11.283 --> 35:13.285
He-He's a desperate man.

35:13.328 --> 35:15.504
And he found Sydney

35:15.548 --> 35:17.811
snooping around outside
his house and he panicked,

35:17.854 --> 35:19.247
because he knew
she was on to him.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.336
And then...Kersplitzo.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.033
[snaps fingers]

35:23.077 --> 35:25.427
TODD: That's weird.
Look at that photo right there.

35:25.471 --> 35:27.168
Mom. 2008.

35:27.212 --> 35:31.390
That is the year that Amy
was crowned Rose Festival Queen.

35:31.433 --> 35:33.392
Who is that?

35:33.435 --> 35:34.871
AMY:
That's Rhonda Zane.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.656
And that's me
s-standing next to her.

35:36.699 --> 35:38.179
That's my elbow right there.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.181
Yeah, we were vying for, um,

35:40.225 --> 35:42.705
Rose Festival Princess
at Jefferson that year.

35:42.749 --> 35:45.621
Wait, Rhonda Zane?
But Lou's last name is Briggs.

35:45.665 --> 35:46.970
She had her mom's last name.

35:47.014 --> 35:48.668
So, you and Rhonda were friends?

35:48.711 --> 35:51.061
Mm, more like rivals.

35:51.105 --> 35:53.194
I never stood a chance
against her, though.

35:53.238 --> 35:56.110
She was beautiful,
smart, talented.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.199
Whole package.
But, um...

35:58.243 --> 36:01.550
then something terrible
happened to her

36:01.594 --> 36:03.378
right before the festival.

36:03.422 --> 36:05.075
Someone...

36:05.119 --> 36:07.208
threw bleach in her face.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.471
Oh, whoa. That's crazy.Who would do that?

36:09.515 --> 36:10.733
They never caught the guy.

36:10.777 --> 36:12.344
But, you know, poor Rhonda

36:12.387 --> 36:15.260
dropped out of the running,
disappeared.

36:15.303 --> 36:18.785
And I heard, a few years later,
that she...

36:18.828 --> 36:20.395
she took her own life.

36:20.439 --> 36:22.136
Oh, that's awful. Poor girl.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.313
So, Lou was seeking revenge.

36:25.357 --> 36:27.750
Revenge? Against who?

36:30.100 --> 36:31.928
Me?

36:31.972 --> 36:34.496
M... Lou was trying to kill me?

36:34.540 --> 36:36.019
Why? I was
always nice

36:36.063 --> 36:37.804
to Rhonda, a-and I would never

36:37.847 --> 36:39.458
throw bleach in someone's face.

36:39.501 --> 36:40.937
I would never...

36:42.678 --> 36:44.767
Oh, my God.

36:44.811 --> 36:48.684
Wait, that-that couldn't
have been... [stammers]

36:48.728 --> 36:52.122
My mom was always competitive,
but she never w-would have...

36:52.166 --> 36:55.517
She wasn't that bad. She...

36:55.561 --> 36:57.998
Um...Do you think it's possible
that-that she...?

36:58.041 --> 36:59.129
So Rhonda would be
out of the running

36:59.173 --> 37:00.522
and you could be Queen.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.350
Lou blamed Amy
for his daughter's death.

37:02.394 --> 37:03.786
Now, when he found out

37:03.830 --> 37:05.266
that it was her
on the jury...He snapped.

37:05.310 --> 37:07.442
A crime of passion.
Righting a wrong from the past.

37:07.486 --> 37:09.357
And he had to do it...

37:09.401 --> 37:11.751
Before Amy left town
for law school.

37:11.794 --> 37:13.318
Motive, opportunity.

37:13.361 --> 37:15.102
Right? And page 37:

37:15.145 --> 37:17.931
Lou "volunteers at the Rose
Gardens in Washington Park."

37:17.974 --> 37:20.107
Access to fertilizer
for the poison.

37:20.150 --> 37:22.152
We have to call the police.
We have to find Lou.

37:22.196 --> 37:24.633
Wait. It's Thursday.Thursday?

37:24.677 --> 37:26.766
BOTH:
"I have dinner
every Thursday night

37:26.809 --> 37:28.289
at Via Tevere Pizzeria."

37:28.333 --> 37:29.769
He loves "a pizza special"!

37:30.987 --> 37:32.206
Stay here. Be right back.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.860
Okay.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.258
There he is, there he is.
It's him.

37:40.301 --> 37:41.389
MARGARET:
Oh, that's him right there.

37:42.956 --> 37:44.436
Patty, w-what
are you doing here?

37:44.479 --> 37:46.394
You are on a date
with a murderer.

37:46.438 --> 37:48.309
No. Again?

37:48.353 --> 37:50.703
Lou Briggs, you're under arrest
for the murders of Irene Kimpton

37:50.746 --> 37:52.574
and Sydney Millcross.No, no, no, no.

37:52.618 --> 37:54.184
LOU:
You should be arresting
Amy Morelin.

37:54.228 --> 37:55.360
She's the one
that did it.

37:55.403 --> 37:56.883
Her and her mother, they...

37:56.926 --> 37:58.537
they destroyed my daughter.

37:58.580 --> 38:01.366
All over a stupid crown.
They killed her.

38:01.409 --> 38:03.281
What happened to your daughter
is tragic.

38:03.324 --> 38:05.108
But Amy had nothing
to do with it.

38:05.152 --> 38:06.545
And I spoke to her
mother in Spokane.

38:06.588 --> 38:08.938
She's willing to take
a lie detector test.

38:08.982 --> 38:11.027
Neither of them
had anything to do

38:11.071 --> 38:12.681
with what happened to Rhonda.

38:12.725 --> 38:14.335
You killed two people

38:14.379 --> 38:15.641
for nothing.

38:15.684 --> 38:16.903
Let's go.

38:18.383 --> 38:20.167
Juror number 12.

38:20.210 --> 38:22.169
I knew it.

38:22.212 --> 38:24.302
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

38:24.345 --> 38:27.870
Total Eclipse Shampoo
and their lawyers

38:27.914 --> 38:29.481
would have you believe
that their product

38:29.524 --> 38:31.918
is completely harmless.

38:31.961 --> 38:34.486
But they are gaslighting you.

38:34.529 --> 38:38.751
Denying what they know to be
true to protect themselves.

38:38.794 --> 38:40.013
[coughing]

38:43.973 --> 38:45.932
[laughs softly]

38:45.975 --> 38:48.195
Thank you for being here today,

38:48.238 --> 38:53.418
to help me help my client
bring the truth to light.

38:54.506 --> 38:55.855
AMY:
Poor Rhonda.

38:55.898 --> 38:57.944
Yeah.And Irene.

38:57.987 --> 38:59.772
And Sydney. Ugh.Yeah.

38:59.815 --> 39:01.904
This whole thing
is just so awful.

39:01.948 --> 39:04.167
I'm just relieved it wasn't you.

39:04.211 --> 39:06.344
The killer, I mean.Yeah. For a minute,

39:06.387 --> 39:07.954
I thought it might have
actually been you.

39:07.997 --> 39:10.348
Me? What?
I wasn't even on the jury.

39:10.391 --> 39:12.045
[laughs]
Well, you're very shifty,

39:12.088 --> 39:13.612
and you were kind of
lurking around.What?

39:13.655 --> 39:15.788
I wasn't lurking.

39:17.746 --> 39:22.316
What do you think
about a second date?

39:22.360 --> 39:25.188
Outside of my house.Um...

39:25.232 --> 39:28.104
And murder-free.

39:28.148 --> 39:31.369
Murder-free?
Mm.

39:31.412 --> 39:34.894
I mean, what would we
even talk about?

39:58.570 --> 40:00.354
How many times
did we go to France?

40:00.398 --> 40:01.747
I don't remember that.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.226
ALLISON:
You have to
remember this place,

40:03.270 --> 40:05.925
because you rememb-- you
insisted on ordering in French.

40:05.968 --> 40:08.406
[door slides closed]Hi.

40:11.974 --> 40:13.367
Um...

40:15.064 --> 40:16.936
MARGARET:
When I gave your father
that watch,

40:16.979 --> 40:18.459
I meant that.

40:18.503 --> 40:19.808
Forever.

40:19.852 --> 40:22.158
But you were gonna leave him.

40:22.202 --> 40:23.595
Yes.

40:26.380 --> 40:29.209
I overheard you guys fighting.

40:29.252 --> 40:31.429
I mean, from my room,
I could hear everything, and...

40:33.474 --> 40:35.433
...I know that he was mad at you
because he thought

40:35.476 --> 40:39.437
that you were lying to him
about something.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.482
I had rented an apartment.

40:41.526 --> 40:44.398
And I didn't
want him to know.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.356
Patty was gonna help me leave.

40:47.619 --> 40:49.142
Mom, why didn't you ever
tell us any of this?

40:49.185 --> 40:53.146
Because I wanted...

40:53.189 --> 40:56.932
I... thought
I had to protect you.

40:58.064 --> 40:59.892
After your father died,

40:59.935 --> 41:02.764
I didn't want to break
your hearts all over again.

41:02.808 --> 41:06.768
Yeah, but I had no idea
you were so unhappy.

41:06.812 --> 41:09.467
Then we did our job as parents.

41:13.819 --> 41:16.648
Oswald was a wonderful father.

41:18.650 --> 41:21.479
But he wasn't
a very good husband.

41:21.522 --> 41:25.221
It became clear that
he didn't appreciate me

41:25.265 --> 41:28.398
or support my
career goals.

41:28.442 --> 41:31.750
And I-I was unhappy.
I was frustrated.

41:31.793 --> 41:33.882
And I wanted more.

41:35.884 --> 41:41.586
Over time, he became emotionally
and verbally abusive.

41:44.153 --> 41:46.721
And I had to fight.

41:46.765 --> 41:47.940
For me.

41:47.983 --> 41:50.638
For myself.

41:50.682 --> 41:52.597
I didn't know
if I should tell you.

41:52.640 --> 41:56.339
I-I didn't know
if I hadto tell you.

41:56.383 --> 41:58.037
I didn't know what to do.

41:59.604 --> 42:02.998
I mean, it's really weird
to think about him,

42:03.042 --> 42:05.392
and you, like this.

42:05.435 --> 42:08.221
I know.

42:09.831 --> 42:12.617
So, uh, y-you didn't leave him,

42:12.660 --> 42:14.706
of y-you didn't
actually do it because...

42:14.749 --> 42:16.882
Because I didn't have to.

42:17.926 --> 42:19.537
Fate intervened.

42:31.766 --> 42:33.725
Chuck.

42:38.251 --> 42:39.644
We need...

42:41.646 --> 42:43.778
We have to talk.
