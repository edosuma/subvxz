Roswell, New Mexico...

00:02.336 --> 00:04.296
You need prior approval
before conducting enforcement

00:04.296 --> 00:06.965
in a hospital.
Unless you calm down,

00:06.965 --> 00:08.967
I'm gonna arrest you
for obstruction.

00:08.967 --> 00:11.762
It's me. I need your help.

00:11.762 --> 00:14.306
Diego, this is Max.
Max, this is...

00:14.306 --> 00:15.474
The ex-fiancé.

00:15.474 --> 00:16.683
Everybody needs help.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.560
Help like rehab?
You will be better.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.480
DIEGO: That toxin in your
friend's system, butyricol--

00:21.480 --> 00:23.232
it's a memory eraser.

00:23.232 --> 00:25.567

I'm-I'm so sorry.
No.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.547
It's all good.

00:47.547 --> 00:50.592
Your monk-like hyper focus
is a turn-on.

00:50.592 --> 00:51.802
(scoffs)

00:51.802 --> 00:54.638
Anyway, I come bearing gifts.

00:54.638 --> 00:58.892
Seared scallops and tres leches
cake from Mizuna.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.978
God bless you.

01:00.978 --> 01:03.188
(laughs)

01:03.188 --> 01:04.898
So, what are you doing
with this worm behind my back?

01:04.898 --> 01:07.317
Oh, administering
a lethal dose of radiation

01:07.317 --> 01:08.610
to observe
a particular neoblast.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.112
Don't be jealous.

01:10.112 --> 01:11.446
Of the neoblast?

01:11.446 --> 01:13.573
It's a regenerative master cell.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.409
The only one with
this protein.

01:15.409 --> 01:18.412
I mean, this particular
cell was able to multiply,

01:18.412 --> 01:21.331
diversify and reanimate my worm.

01:21.331 --> 01:24.126
Wait. So observing
the master gets you

01:24.126 --> 01:26.378
the underlying mechanisms
of tissue regeneration.

01:26.378 --> 01:30.632
Then-then I apply the
mechanism to human tissue, and

01:30.632 --> 01:31.925
irreversible injury
and degradation

01:31.925 --> 01:33.677
become distant memory.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.848
God, I-I mean,
I know... I know

01:37.848 --> 01:39.725
that's not gonna happen
in our lifetime, but...

01:39.725 --> 01:42.644
Babe...
This could be
a step to help.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.730
Elizabeth, you...

01:44.730 --> 01:47.190
You're a once-in-a-lifetime.

01:47.190 --> 01:50.360
(laughs)
You are extraordinary!

01:50.360 --> 01:52.279
Limits don't apply.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.827
Screw it.

01:58.827 --> 02:03.081
You see, I had this...
whole thing planned

02:03.081 --> 02:05.167
at the restaurant, but...

02:05.167 --> 02:06.877
I guess it's fitting
that we do this here

02:06.877 --> 02:09.379
in the lab at almost midnight.

02:09.379 --> 02:10.630
Wait. What?

02:13.633 --> 02:16.219
All my life,
I've been competitive.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.805

02:18.805 --> 02:21.641
to just stand back
and watch someone shine.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.435
I've never been
so willing

02:23.435 --> 02:26.688
to put my heart
in someone else's hands.

02:26.688 --> 02:30.525
I've never met anyone
like you, Elizabeth.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.486

You told us to meet you at
6:00 before the CrashCon rush.

You weren't here,

She's still processing
everything.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.751
How light is this
cardio, exactly?

04:11.751 --> 04:13.336

consult Kyle.

here to help my dad.

04:44.326 --> 04:47.662

in the abduction case

04:47.662 --> 04:50.123

since my resurrection.
Mm.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.249
What's the breakthrough?

04:51.249 --> 04:53.835
Well, Cam was injected
with butyricol.

04:53.835 --> 04:57.422
Mm-hmm.
Which we now know is a rare,
memory-erasing drug

04:57.422 --> 04:59.799
that, uh, very few
people have access to.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.218

05:01.218 --> 05:03.011
highly-classified
military trial.

05:03.011 --> 05:06.389
We think Cameron was abducted
to lure Charlie out of hiding.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.225
There are a lot of people
with an interest

05:08.225 --> 05:10.227

bioweaponry expertise.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.479
Has anyone tried
reaching out to Alex, see if

05:12.479 --> 05:14.481
there's a butyricol connection
with Project Shepherd?

05:14.481 --> 05:16.608
LIZ: He's off the grid at an
Air Force recruitment thing.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.610
We'll ask him when
he's back in town,

05:18.610 --> 05:19.945
but that won't be
'till after CrashCon.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.867

06:05.115 --> 06:07.075
I told her I would
send her her sketchbooks.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.744
She needs them for therapy, and
I totally forgot to mail them.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.205
I'll take 'em.
I love a road trip.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.499

Really?

06:14.499 --> 06:16.001
Yeah.
That would be amazing.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.335

Hey, man.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.053

Yeah, my mom says
D.C. is buzzing

06:27.053 --> 06:28.305

immigration enforcement.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.056

your father in the clear.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.353

some powerful lawyers.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.439
I wish I could say we didn't
need the help, but...

06:37.439 --> 06:39.065

Hi.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.692
I'm Isobel Evans.

06:40.692 --> 06:43.069

Roswell welcoming committee.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.365
at all, I'm yours.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.159

06:49.159 --> 06:50.869
restaurant recommendations,

06:50.869 --> 06:53.121
or a good place
to watch the sunset.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.081
I think we can let go
of the poor man's hand now.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.543
I need Rosa's sketchbooks.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.961
Oh, uh, upstairs
through the kitchen.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.504

molecular gastronomy.

07:41.169 --> 07:44.005
Oh, got to stay on top

07:44.005 --> 07:45.965

07:45.965 --> 07:48.301
Look, I was thinking.
Mm-hmm.

07:48.301 --> 07:52.013
I bet butyricol uses
inducible diphtheria toxins

07:52.013 --> 07:55.350
to stun the memory expression
neurons into paralysis.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.976

07:56.976 --> 07:58.395
we can get your friend
her memories back.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.316
Would it boost
GABA in DLPFC?

08:03.316 --> 08:06.194
See, no, you're thinking
working memory, not recovery.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.154
Think traumatic memory.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.781
Think tiny kitchen.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.199

in their costumes

08:11.199 --> 08:12.867
who won't go away
until we feed them.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.786

08:14.786 --> 08:16.162

That's what I'm doing here.
I'm looking for him.

09:04.169 --> 09:07.630
Try again. You told Alex
Tripp gave you this in 1987.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.800
That's before the Crashdown
ever used this logo.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.053
You lied to get Alex to recover
the piece of alien tech from me.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.597

him once he had it?!

09:21.603 --> 09:23.521
I just found out
Alex never made it

09:23.521 --> 09:25.398
to Andrews Air Force Base
last week.

09:25.398 --> 09:29.402
He's disabled,
he's got PTSD,

09:29.402 --> 09:31.154
so I'm concerned about him.

09:31.154 --> 09:34.199
Your kinder-gentler,
bigot-scumbag thing

09:34.199 --> 09:35.867
isn't gonna work with me.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.827
Without even
touching you,

09:37.827 --> 09:41.164
I can rip your trachea out
and show it to you.

09:41.164 --> 09:45.460
Guerin, for once,
we're on the same side.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.504
We both want Alex back.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.298
So, yeah, go ahead,
lose your only lead.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.592
Or you could let me
help you find him.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.640
(camera shutter clicks)

09:58.640 --> 10:00.767
Oh.
(laughs softly)

10:00.767 --> 10:03.061
Sorry, girl.
It's just,

10:03.061 --> 10:05.146
no one would believe me
if I didn't have pics.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.940
I brought you your sketchbooks.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.733
Liz says she's sorry
she couldn't come.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.735
That's okay. It's CrashCon.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.737
And also, my dad--
how is he?

10:12.737 --> 10:15.532
He's good. He's lying low.
He sends his love.

10:15.532 --> 10:19.285
And he did send pan dulces, too,
but I got hungry on the drive,

10:19.285 --> 10:22.288
so...
Oh. Don't you mess with me.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.123
You do not realize

10:24.123 --> 10:25.959

Thank you.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.132
And thank you for coming.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.469
What are your ulterior motives?

10:36.469 --> 10:39.347
I am curious
about what's in your journals.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.348
My sketchbooks?

10:40.348 --> 10:42.350
Well...
there's writing in them.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.351
You read my journals?

10:43.351 --> 10:44.519
Uh, your sketchbooks.

10:44.519 --> 10:45.979
And no,
I didn't really read anything.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.522
I'm trying this new thing

10:47.522 --> 10:49.148
where I don't follow
every selfish impulse.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.149
But you still looked.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.610
What are you looking for?

10:53.611 --> 10:55.196
Myself.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.364
So to speak.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.908
I'm curious about...

10:58.908 --> 11:02.036
what might be in there
from the whole... Noah thing.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.621
You can look,

11:03.621 --> 11:06.332
and if you see something
that you want to know about,

11:06.332 --> 11:09.168
just ask.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.629
I'm probably gonna tell you
to mind your beeswax, but...

11:11.629 --> 11:13.339
you know, shoot your shot.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.640
How are you?

11:22.640 --> 11:23.850
Hey!

11:28.980 --> 11:31.232
Are we stress eating?

11:32.233 --> 11:33.943
Where's Maria?

11:33.943 --> 11:36.070
She's at a retreat for her mom.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.864
She left yesterday.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.741
I'll be your server.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.659
(choking laugh)

11:41.659 --> 11:43.453
Mm. Whiskey.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.163
Leave the bottle.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.292
I tried calling you earlier.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.376
Who gave you my number?

11:50.376 --> 11:51.461
You know what?

11:51.461 --> 11:53.212
I'm not in a
chatty mood.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.298
I was suspended from work today.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.842
Craziest thing,
I was accused

11:57.842 --> 12:00.428
of stealing hospital resources
for personal use.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.847
There might even be
a criminal investigation.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.307
Look...

12:04.307 --> 12:06.434
you're a good person.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.561
You probably deserve for me
to leave you the hell alone,

12:08.561 --> 12:10.855
which is why I wish
I didn't have to ask you.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.274
But I'm concerned
that Project Shepherd

12:13.274 --> 12:15.485
might be tied to these...
abductions.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.321
You can't ask Alex?

12:18.321 --> 12:20.073
He's out of town.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.574
(sighs heavily)

12:21.574 --> 12:24.702
Look, I'm just trying to
figure out who's hurting people.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.707
I hate having a conscience.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.587
How's baking going?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.297
Ah, I'm gonna win
Top Chef.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.091
Oh, come on, you
know damn well

12:38.091 --> 12:41.427
no one uses eggshells on purpose
in any kind of cooking.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.471
You met my meemaw--
don't insult me.

12:43.471 --> 12:46.057
You're making
calcium carbonate.

12:46.057 --> 12:48.434
Is this about
regenerating worms?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.812
Uh, kind of.
I'm testing out a theory.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.815
I know I have to recreate it
in a sterile environment later,

12:53.815 --> 12:56.359
but with my dad laying low
in peak tourist season,

12:56.359 --> 12:58.653
I haven't been able to spend
as much time in the lab.

12:58.653 --> 13:01.030
The lab that made
you sign an NDA.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.282
Which is where again?
Nice try.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.492
Yeah.

13:12.041 --> 13:15.920
"The groundbreaking
research led by...

13:15.920 --> 13:18.131
"Elizabeth Ortecho

13:18.131 --> 13:21.843
is the future of
biomedical engineering."

13:21.843 --> 13:23.678
(exhales)
(laughs)

13:23.678 --> 13:26.347
This grant changes
everything.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.307
I mean, there is
so much more that we can do now.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.852
We are...
we are really gonna save lives.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.520
I'm so proud of you.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.521
(scoffs)

13:33.521 --> 13:34.772
(both laugh)

13:38.067 --> 13:39.318
Oh...

13:39.318 --> 13:40.862
my God, are you okay?

13:40.862 --> 13:42.780
Sorry, I didn't...
No, I'm... I'm okay.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.490
I'm fine. Fine.
It's just...

13:46.367 --> 13:47.493
(sniffles)

13:47.493 --> 13:50.663
When I was a kid, um...

13:50.663 --> 13:53.166
I felt trapped in my life.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.585
I was just thinking
about what this would
have meant to me then.

13:55.585 --> 13:58.421
To know that the person I am...

13:58.421 --> 13:59.714
existed.

14:03.134 --> 14:06.554
This isn't what the world
teaches girls like me to dream.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.517
What would you do...
if you could do anything?

14:11.517 --> 14:12.935
I want a Nobel Prize.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.438
Strong start.

14:15.438 --> 14:16.898
(chuckles)

14:16.898 --> 14:18.983
Okay. What next?

14:20.318 --> 14:22.904
(clears throat)
Citizenship for my dad.

14:22.904 --> 14:26.199
I want him to not always
have to be so scared.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.452
And I want to be less angry.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.916
I'm angry so much of the time.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.918
Anger's not so bad.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.378
It reminds us that
something's not right.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.255
And then we change it.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.757
And you...

14:42.757 --> 14:45.760
are gonna change everything.

14:47.512 --> 14:51.015
I'm so glad I get to stand
beside you while you do.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.437
Wait, I don't think
that's fully...

14:56.437 --> 14:57.855
Why are you helping me?

14:57.855 --> 14:59.482
I mean, my dad. But me.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.776
You sound like my girlfriend.

15:01.776 --> 15:06.656
Naomi was also surprised
that I would rush to Roswell

15:06.656 --> 15:09.534
to help someone who...
bulldozed my life.

15:09.534 --> 15:12.411
I really wish I would have
handled things differently.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.997
But if you had,
I wouldn't have Naomi.

15:14.997 --> 15:18.167
I mean, I have a good life,
Elizabeth. I'm happy.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.752
I do miss you
at work, though.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.630
(laughs)
There's really... there's
no replacing you there.

15:22.630 --> 15:23.965
Yeah, I get the feeling.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.591
So wouldn't it feel really good

15:25.591 --> 15:29.512
if you would just tell me
what your secret experiment is?

15:31.430 --> 15:33.057
Hypothetically,

15:33.057 --> 15:35.101
let's say there's
this rare blood disorder

15:35.101 --> 15:37.478
that affects
one in four million people.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.564
No research, no treatments.

15:39.564 --> 15:41.274
Until you?

15:41.274 --> 15:43.234
Do you remember
my planarian neoblasts

15:43.234 --> 15:44.443
with the regenerative proteins?

15:44.443 --> 15:46.612
Yeah.
So, I...

15:46.612 --> 15:49.490
KYLE: Searching
for the term "butyricol."

15:49.490 --> 15:52.994
What makes you think it's got a
connection to Project Shepherd?

15:52.994 --> 15:54.453
The drug was developed
by the military.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.831
Mm-hmm.
And the only
other clue we have

15:56.831 --> 16:00.293
is a fractal
burn pattern,

16:00.293 --> 16:02.003
which is an alien thing.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.671
And Project Shepherd
is in the middle

16:03.671 --> 16:06.257
of your alien-military
Venn diagram.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.508
Yeah.
Ah.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.593
I know.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.595
It's a long shot, but...

16:10.595 --> 16:12.263
it's all I have right now.

16:12.263 --> 16:15.641
I'm surprised you haven't asked
to see this sooner.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.893
Yeah, I'm still figuring out

16:16.893 --> 16:18.436
how much information
I want to know.

16:18.436 --> 16:21.439
I mean, you ever wake up
from a night of drinking and...

16:21.439 --> 16:23.608
not want to know
what happened the night before,

16:23.608 --> 16:25.484
in case it's worse
than you imagined.

16:25.484 --> 16:29.238
Like if I don't remember Taylor
Swift drag night at Planet 7,

16:29.238 --> 16:30.656
then it didn't happen?

16:30.656 --> 16:32.074
(grunts)
No.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.910
Can't relate.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.536
(chuckles)
Mm.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.038
Oh. Thank you.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.581
Uh, when this is done,
why don't you let me

16:38.581 --> 16:40.541
give you a lift
over to Liz's lab?

16:40.541 --> 16:42.668
We can load up
the stolen equipment

16:42.668 --> 16:44.670
so you can return it.
She's not using it.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.048
Nah. We don't have to do that.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.507
What? I mean,
your handprint

16:48.507 --> 16:51.177
gives you access
to their security system, right?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.721
(stammers softly)
So, you know,
just get in there

16:53.721 --> 16:55.056
and return their stuff.

16:55.056 --> 16:56.641
Maybe they'll go easier on you
if they have it.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.727
Hmm.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.527
Flint.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.362
What'd you do with your brother?

17:15.743 --> 17:19.038
Drop the gun. You can't pull
intel from a dead soldier.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.790
I'd be careful, kid.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.333
I taught you
everything you know,

17:22.333 --> 17:23.918
but I didn't teach you
everything I know.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.633
You wouldn't have showed up
unless you wanted my attention.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.134
Well, here I am.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.511
Where is Alex?

17:33.511 --> 17:35.763
He's safe and sound.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.140
I know how concerned you are
about his safety.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.558
That why you had him locked
in the basement?

17:39.558 --> 17:41.018
You kidnapped
him first, Pops.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.603
What do you want
from him, anyway?

17:42.603 --> 17:44.855
You hand him over to me
right now.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.233
No. This time
I outrank you,

17:47.233 --> 17:48.901
and I haven't granted clearance.

17:50.361 --> 17:51.821
You outrank me?

17:51.821 --> 17:53.614
You went soft.

17:53.614 --> 17:57.660
My entire life has been
about destroying the aliens.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.787
That's all I've done:
develop weapons,

17:59.787 --> 18:01.247
develop strategy.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.332
Fighting for our species,

18:03.332 --> 18:04.959
'cause you told me.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.800
I was wrong.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.219
You can't do that.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.054
(sighs)

18:17.054 --> 18:19.640
I don't need you for this,
old man.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.976
(engine starts)

18:25.479 --> 18:27.857
(high-pitched ringing)

18:27.857 --> 18:29.358
You had him in your basement?

18:29.358 --> 18:31.152
What, you took him last week

18:31.152 --> 18:33.988
after you got that piece
of alien tech from me?

18:38.826 --> 18:40.578
He's a loose end.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.830
If we got him
back from Flint,

18:42.830 --> 18:44.081
you were gonna kill him.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.501
You are barely human!

18:47.501 --> 18:50.463
Ooh! When I was
a kid, I thought

18:50.463 --> 18:54.425
maybe because of my high IQ, my
species was superior to yours.

18:57.011 --> 18:59.180
Then I fell in love
with your son.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.851
And I didn't feel superior
anymore.

19:03.851 --> 19:06.062
I am angry.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.440
And smashing things, it's easy.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.527
Alex has evolved past that.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.987
He's past you!

19:16.447 --> 19:18.449
And he's past me.

19:18.449 --> 19:21.202
Despite you--
you slapping him around,

19:21.202 --> 19:24.288
shoving that Manes Man
crap down his throat,

19:24.288 --> 19:26.123
he still loves.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.334
He even loves you.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.839
You don't deserve
to call him your son.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.092
(Michael running)

19:43.933 --> 19:46.936
You know, we really don't
have to do this right now.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.354
We got nowhere
with Project Shepherd.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.314
Let's do one
productive thing today

19:50.314 --> 19:52.149
and return this stuff
so we can do someone some good.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.568
(takes deep breath)
Yeah.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.779
Uh, okay.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.199
(whirrs, beeps)

20:01.158 --> 20:04.495
Um...

20:04.495 --> 20:06.372
do you have access?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.165
No.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.458
No, I was...

20:09.458 --> 20:12.086
deceased when
the guest list was created.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.007
KYLE:
Maybe Liz was still pissed

20:17.007 --> 20:19.218
about the pollen
in my mom's perfume,

20:19.218 --> 20:21.262
had Alex revoke my access.

20:21.262 --> 20:23.013
It doesn't matter.

20:23.013 --> 20:26.684
If Diego was able to find out
about this butyricol

20:26.684 --> 20:29.019
through his...
fancy connections,

20:29.019 --> 20:31.313
maybe it wasn't
a Project Shepherd

20:31.313 --> 20:32.565
or Caulfield trial.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.400
Maybe it was
legit military.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.360
Mm, military would have
some use for something

20:36.360 --> 20:38.154
that would erase state secrets
from people's minds--

20:38.154 --> 20:39.905
they can't spill
to the enemy.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.407
Or you could erase
bad memories

20:41.407 --> 20:42.825
from soldiers
coming home.

20:42.825 --> 20:45.703
(sighs) Or it could be a weapon.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.705
Erase an army's memories...

20:47.705 --> 20:50.166
they don't know what they're
fighting for anymore.

20:50.166 --> 20:53.210
Project Shepherd
hasn't been legit in years,

20:53.210 --> 20:56.505
so what does Flint Manes do,
officially, for the military?

20:58.007 --> 21:00.217
He's a weapons specialist.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.136
He could have access
to biochemical trials.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.387
Let's go.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.722
Find out what he's up to.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.767
My team at-at my
research facility.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.145
we found a-a rare protein.

21:11.145 --> 21:13.355
A mutated gene. May--

21:13.355 --> 21:14.773
You know what?

21:14.773 --> 21:16.358
I've said too much.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.235
You probably think
I'm delusional anyway.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.237
No, you're not delusional.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.198
Elizabeth Holmes was delusional.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.658
Yeah, well, at least
Elizabeth Holmes had funding.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.243
You can get funding.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.750
The second we move from
worms to human cells,

21:32.750 --> 21:36.670
they pull our funding,
and that it isn't fair.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.423
I think you should

21:39.423 --> 21:41.425
reconsider
the Genoryx grant.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.886
What difference
does it make?

21:43.886 --> 21:45.638
Every research facility
in this country

21:45.638 --> 21:47.765
answers to the same
uber-conservative

21:47.765 --> 21:49.391
Department of Health
and Human Services.

21:49.391 --> 21:52.228
Well, whoever's funding Genoryx

21:52.228 --> 21:56.106
isn't super concerned
about FDA guidelines.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.566
They're above
the red tape.

21:57.566 --> 22:01.070
Look, you can start
saving the world now.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.239
I can't do anything

22:03.239 --> 22:05.199
shady or secret.

22:05.199 --> 22:07.368
I, I have too much to lose.

22:07.368 --> 22:09.453
My God, Elizabeth!

22:09.453 --> 22:10.704
You don't always
have to be this

22:10.704 --> 22:14.041
perfect daughter
of a perfect immigrant!

22:14.041 --> 22:16.335
Yes, I do, because
the imperfect daughter

22:16.335 --> 22:18.462
is in a box
at Frontier Valley Cemetery!

22:20.422 --> 22:23.801
Genoryx has more money than
they know what to do with.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.303
Just because your office
has ping-pong tables

22:26.303 --> 22:28.639
and hypobaric
napping chambers,

22:28.639 --> 22:31.475
does not mean that
Genoryx isn't unethical.

22:31.475 --> 22:33.686
(through bullhorn):
Greetings, Graham Crackers!

22:33.686 --> 22:35.062
Today,
Son of a...

22:35.062 --> 22:36.230
a private citizen pledged

22:36.230 --> 22:38.148
a donation to the museum

22:38.148 --> 22:40.901
that will change
the course of human history.

22:40.901 --> 22:44.947
At closing night,
7:00 p.m., main stage,

22:44.947 --> 22:47.116
I will unveil the most

22:47.116 --> 22:49.827
astonishing
alien artifact I've seen

22:49.827 --> 22:52.288
in all my years of collecting.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.415
(cheering)

22:59.420 --> 23:01.255
(grunts)
Bye, now.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.262
(laughs)

23:11.307 --> 23:12.349
(door closes)

23:15.519 --> 23:17.187
Oh, hell no.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.404
(high-pitched ringing)
(air hisses)

23:34.163 --> 23:35.372
(grunts)

23:43.672 --> 23:45.341
(chuckles):
Oh, gosh.

23:45.341 --> 23:48.552
This is
the post-high school chapter.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.013
Which is really just
a big burn book on my mom.

23:53.515 --> 23:56.435
Finding out
my dad wasn't my dad...

23:56.435 --> 23:57.978
was bad.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.609
It was Liz's senior year

24:03.609 --> 24:06.028
when I dumped
my drug dealer boyfriend,

24:06.028 --> 24:08.572
and I went to this N.A. meeting.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.115
I think that was the first time

24:10.115 --> 24:12.242
that I ever actually wanted
to get better.

24:12.242 --> 24:15.412
But still, I wore a hoodie,
I sat in the back,

24:15.412 --> 24:16.914
I made myself...

24:16.914 --> 24:19.041
really invisible.

24:19.041 --> 24:20.793
I was...

24:20.793 --> 24:22.795
high at the meeting.

24:27.383 --> 24:28.967
You can see it if you want to.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.221
Jump in.

24:37.601 --> 24:40.562
(high-pitched ringing)

24:40.562 --> 24:42.314
(applause)

24:44.066 --> 24:47.569
(woman's distorted voice)

24:47.569 --> 24:49.405
The drinking started

24:49.405 --> 24:52.616
when the man I loved left me.

24:52.616 --> 24:55.244
That was almost 20 years ago.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.621
And I still see him every day.

24:57.621 --> 25:00.624
I see him in the street,
in my business,

25:00.624 --> 25:02.626
but I can handle that.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.461
What I can't handle

25:04.461 --> 25:06.755
is when I see him
in our daughter's eyes.

25:06.755 --> 25:09.425
(distorting, echoing):
Sometimes I think

25:09.425 --> 25:12.052
if we didn't have
a child together,

25:12.052 --> 25:15.472
I might not hurt so much
all these years later.

25:15.472 --> 25:19.643
I might not still love him,
but I do today.

25:19.643 --> 25:21.478
So I drink and I take pills.

25:21.478 --> 25:25.107
And I try not to look
my daughter in the eye.

25:27.609 --> 25:28.986
(crying softly)

25:34.116 --> 25:35.868
Why did you want
to show me that?

25:38.036 --> 25:40.664
I...

25:40.664 --> 25:44.042
I cannot relate to marrying...

25:44.042 --> 25:47.838
a body-stealing alien sociopath.

25:47.838 --> 25:50.132
(wry laugh)
You're kind of
on your own for that one.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.468
But I know that
you're feeling messed up

25:52.468 --> 25:54.553
over not knowing your real mom.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.432
And I guess I just...

25:58.432 --> 26:01.101
feel like
it's worth saying that I...

26:01.101 --> 26:03.270
wish I knew mine
a little bit less.

26:07.107 --> 26:10.986
Javi, la migra.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.823
Cuídate.
Te llamo mas tarde.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.286
What are you doing here?

26:19.286 --> 26:20.913
How's your dad,
Miss Ortecho?

26:20.913 --> 26:22.331
Tell you what.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.166
Coffee's on the house
if you take it to go.

26:24.166 --> 26:27.294
Oh, sounds pretty
entitled for a Mexican.

26:29.505 --> 26:32.090
With a criminal record.
You do know
I own this place, right?

26:32.090 --> 26:34.051
I can refuse service
to racist dicks.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.011
You know, it's a shame.

26:36.011 --> 26:39.348
You'd be good-looking if
it wasn't for that ugly mouth.

26:39.348 --> 26:42.893
Oh, do you want to know
what my ugly mouth can do?

26:42.893 --> 26:45.103
Liz, maybe don't.
My ugly mouth

26:45.103 --> 26:48.065
can tell the ACLU
that you, Chad Hinkle,

26:48.065 --> 26:50.567
were on track
to miss your monthly quota when

26:50.567 --> 26:52.110
you violated
the fourth amendment

26:52.110 --> 26:54.321
by yanking my dad
out of a hospital.

26:54.321 --> 26:57.282
Now that you're here,
my mouth can tell my lawyer

26:57.282 --> 26:59.159
to press misdemeanor
stalking charges.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.537
My mouth can say
that your sister's kid

27:01.537 --> 27:04.122
goes to school in a district
she does not live in.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.123
But, hey,
that's just from Google.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.125
You listen, bitch...
No.

27:07.125 --> 27:10.838
You want to destroy my family
over a bogus vandalism charge?

27:10.838 --> 27:12.589
Why do we have to be perfect

27:12.589 --> 27:14.716
to deserve to exist
within some arbitrary border?

27:14.716 --> 27:17.761
Why is it okay for you
to screw up, but not me?

27:17.761 --> 27:21.306
Because I am me,
and you're a waitress.

27:22.975 --> 27:23.976
But not to me.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.769
The acting director

27:25.769 --> 27:28.397
of U.S. Customs
and Immigration Enforcement

27:28.397 --> 27:30.649
literally came
to my birthday party.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.401
He's a friend of the family.

27:33.777 --> 27:34.987
So is she.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.660
You have a nice day,
Miss Ortecho.

27:44.162 --> 27:46.123
Oops.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.917
Oops, I did it again.

27:53.130 --> 27:56.174
(door opens)
Liz?

27:56.174 --> 27:58.844
Liz, are...?
Are you okay?
I'm fine. I'm fine.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.971
(door closes)

28:00.971 --> 28:02.973
I'm gonna go call Max.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.191
KYLE:
So this is Flint's place.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.365
All right, why don't
you check back there?

28:20.365 --> 28:22.034
I'll check this side.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.411
We're looking for anything
related to the Camerons.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.204
Check in everything, under
everything, behind everything.

28:26.204 --> 28:28.582
I get it. Check everything.

28:28.582 --> 28:30.375
MAX:
Okay.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.143
Hey.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.103
What, you find something?

28:50.103 --> 28:53.398
Uh... maybe. You?

28:53.398 --> 28:56.735
Maybe. Come here.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.071
(vehicle approaching)

29:00.948 --> 29:03.283
(panting)

29:03.283 --> 29:05.243
Here, in here.

29:05.243 --> 29:07.621
Okay. Okay.

29:07.621 --> 29:10.290
(dialing)

29:10.290 --> 29:13.085
Ooh, just...

29:13.085 --> 29:15.087
hear her voice and then hang up.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.631
That's it.

29:17.631 --> 29:19.716
(line ringing)

29:21.259 --> 29:23.053
Dirk speaking.

29:23.053 --> 29:24.846
Hello?

29:24.846 --> 29:26.348
Helena?

29:26.348 --> 29:28.141
Helena, is that you, baby?

29:28.141 --> 29:30.727
Oh, if it is, please come home.

29:30.727 --> 29:33.313
We've been so worried.
I love you so much.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.148
If this is the bastard
who took her,

29:35.148 --> 29:37.651
I hope you rot in hell,
you son of a bitch.

29:37.651 --> 29:39.903
(phone beeps off)

29:40.946 --> 29:43.365
(door opens)

29:43.365 --> 29:45.659
(door closes,
footsteps approaching)

30:14.938 --> 30:17.774
(door opens, footsteps recede)

30:17.774 --> 30:20.360
(door closes)

30:20.360 --> 30:22.320
(sighs)

30:22.320 --> 30:23.572
You think it's safe?

30:23.572 --> 30:25.115
Maybe.
(vehicle engine starts)

30:25.115 --> 30:26.366
Dude.

30:27.951 --> 30:30.120
(sniffs)

30:30.120 --> 30:31.705
Anyone ever tell you
you smell like rain?

30:43.383 --> 30:46.094
(vehicle approaching)

30:47.804 --> 30:48.805
Max?

30:51.391 --> 30:52.642
The hunting van.

30:52.642 --> 30:55.228
We need to get back to town.
Now.

31:01.234 --> 31:03.487
You know, despite my
bad girl reputation,

31:03.487 --> 31:05.989
I'm actually not on board with
breaking you out of rehab.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.824
So... if you can please
make that clear to Liz.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.159
Look, my mom is missing.

31:09.159 --> 31:10.619
Okay? She could be one
of the abducted.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.662
Uh, maybe
she was leaving Roswell,

31:12.662 --> 31:13.955
on her way out of town,

31:13.955 --> 31:15.665
and something happened.
I don't... I don't know.

31:15.665 --> 31:18.168
Yeah. Maybe.

31:18.168 --> 31:20.754
Or maybe she's bailing
on her new family

31:20.754 --> 31:22.589
like she bailed on her old one.

31:22.589 --> 31:25.634
Look, this is not an excuse
to leave rehab, okay?

31:25.634 --> 31:27.052
I just want to find out
that she's okay.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.262
Then I'm gonna go right back.
Sure, Jan.

31:29.262 --> 31:30.889
I literally only have
a week left.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.600
I might as well practice
being sober sooner than later.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.813
You want to stay... longer?

31:37.813 --> 31:39.648
I want to stay until I'm better.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.694
Listen, Noah was a...

31:44.694 --> 31:46.863
treacherous,
serial-killing alien,

31:46.863 --> 31:49.282
but he did have a happy knack
for day trading.

31:49.282 --> 31:51.868
And... I've been
trying to figure out

31:51.868 --> 31:53.829
what to do with
all that money

31:53.829 --> 31:55.205
he left behind.

31:55.205 --> 31:58.125
Oh, you...
you don't have to do that.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.043
I want to be better, too.

32:00.043 --> 32:03.255
The more that I learn
about Louise,

32:03.255 --> 32:05.757
the more I want to be like her.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.677
She was a good person,
and she made a difference.

32:08.677 --> 32:12.472
Someone told me
recently that...

32:12.472 --> 32:15.642
they saw a lot
of her in me.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.147
I really want that to be true.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.818
Hey, you missed the turn.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.530
I haven't heard back
from Michael all day.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.490
I just want to stop by
the junkyard and make sure

32:30.490 --> 32:34.244
that he's still... alive.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.121
(buzzing, zapping)

32:36.121 --> 32:38.915
(yelling)
Oh...

32:38.915 --> 32:41.042
Nap time is over,
sweetheart.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.754
So this is the perk

32:44.754 --> 32:46.882
of being a weapons
specialist, huh?

32:46.882 --> 32:49.759
(groans, pants)

32:49.759 --> 32:53.054
Oh, if this is your... attempt

32:53.054 --> 32:55.140
to convince me that you aren't

32:55.140 --> 32:56.850
a horde of violent invaders

32:56.850 --> 32:59.102
here to colonize a planet
that isn't yours,

32:59.102 --> 33:01.104
I mean, you're doing
a really bang-up job.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.900
You know, I was a good kid.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.611
I wanted to be an
agricultural engineer.

33:07.611 --> 33:09.738
Maybe have a couple kids,

33:09.738 --> 33:11.615
start a dad band.

33:12.908 --> 33:14.659
But then I was provoked.

33:16.745 --> 33:17.913
And now, I'm this.

33:17.913 --> 33:19.956
Maybe there's
still hope for you.

33:19.956 --> 33:23.877
Your brother Gregory's living
a peaceful life teaching kids,

33:23.877 --> 33:25.754
staying jacked
on the res.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.924
And Alex-- Alex...
Alex is a traitor.

33:28.924 --> 33:30.717
He'll be court-martialed

33:30.717 --> 33:32.093
when this is over.

33:32.093 --> 33:34.012
So he's still alive?

33:35.347 --> 33:37.098
(laughs)

33:37.098 --> 33:39.559
You were early.

33:39.559 --> 33:41.394
What are you talking about?

33:41.394 --> 33:44.773
You know,
my father demanded a meeting.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.859
I had just left Sanders' Auto.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.986
If you hurt that old man!
I wouldn't touch him.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.947
Okay?
He's a hardworking American.

33:51.947 --> 33:53.448
I was just leaving you a note.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.992
And I took Alex because I knew

33:55.992 --> 33:58.370
it was the best way
to get you to cooperate.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.415
Alex will be fine

34:02.415 --> 34:04.125
as long as you do what I say.

34:04.125 --> 34:07.837
If you disobey,
make my day any worse,

34:07.837 --> 34:10.340
Alex will die
knowing you are the reason.

34:11.925 --> 34:13.969
So why don't you untie me

34:13.969 --> 34:16.346
and apologize?
We'll go from there.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.815
Diego, you really don't
need to stick around.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.192
I don't want to keep
you from your life.

34:29.192 --> 34:32.237
Elizabeth, ICE agents came
to your business today.

34:32.237 --> 34:33.863
And I handled it.
With my help.

34:33.863 --> 34:36.533
It's okay to need help.

34:36.533 --> 34:40.453
Listen,
Genoryx invests in their people.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.247
You are valuable.

34:42.247 --> 34:44.916
I'm sure they'll sponsor
Arturo's path to citizenship

34:44.916 --> 34:46.459
if you just sign on.

34:46.459 --> 34:50.297
In the meantime, you can work
in a sanctuary city.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.756
(door opens)

34:51.756 --> 34:53.258
LIZ:
Hey.

34:53.258 --> 34:55.635
Did you get my messages?
Yeah. Hey, Diego.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.554
Uh, any progress
on Arturo's case?

34:57.554 --> 35:00.098
(sighs)

35:00.098 --> 35:02.100
I think we're on the...
the right track.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.643
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.895
Have a good
night, guys.
Yeah.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.480
(door opens)

35:07.480 --> 35:08.982
Something wrong?

35:08.982 --> 35:10.650
(door closes)

35:10.650 --> 35:12.360
Got to tell you something,
but you might want to sit down.

35:14.446 --> 35:18.450
Kyle and I connected butyricol
to Flint Manes.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.493
So I called Alex's other
brother, Greg, and he said that

35:20.493 --> 35:22.370
Flint has this property
outside of town.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.080
He drives a massive
hunting van, Liz.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.957
He was the sniper
the night we found Cameron.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.375
Have you called Alex?

35:27.375 --> 35:29.336
No, Kyle's on it, but
there's-there's something else.

35:29.336 --> 35:32.797
I found this

35:32.797 --> 35:34.174
in Flint's trash.

35:34.174 --> 35:36.217
This is the box my dad kept
my abuelita's ring in

35:36.217 --> 35:37.469
until my mom stole it.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.304
I got the ring back,
but she kept the box.

35:39.304 --> 35:42.223
Rosa called earlier.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.975
She was worried about Mom.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.269
I said that she probably just
bailed like she always does.

35:48.188 --> 35:52.108
Okay. If-if Flint used Jenna
to get to Charlie

35:52.108 --> 35:54.194
because Charlie builds
bioweapons,

35:54.194 --> 35:55.779
what does he want with my mom?

35:55.779 --> 35:57.113
Maybe he's trying to get to

35:57.113 --> 35:58.573
another bioengineering genius.

35:58.573 --> 36:01.326
Well, that's not gonna work.
I don't care about her.

36:01.326 --> 36:03.703
(sighs)
Okay.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.332
Max, what's going on?

36:07.332 --> 36:09.167
You're being... cold.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.919
This is a serious
conversation.

36:10.919 --> 36:13.171
No, don't do that.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.839
What's going on?

36:16.383 --> 36:19.052
I know Maria left yesterday.

36:19.052 --> 36:21.179
I saw her and Mimi off
from the Wild Pony.

36:21.179 --> 36:24.224
So I know you didn't spend
last night helping her process.

36:24.224 --> 36:27.227
And you certainly didn't
spend last night here.

36:27.227 --> 36:31.398
I didn't push it this morning
because I trust you,

36:31.398 --> 36:33.233
and everyone's entitled
to their secrets.

36:33.233 --> 36:35.068
If this about Diego,
you're way off base.

36:35.068 --> 36:37.153
I wish this was about Diego.

36:38.655 --> 36:41.032
Why is Kyle locked out
of your lab?

36:41.032 --> 36:42.534
Why did you tell me

36:42.534 --> 36:44.411
that no one's accepting
your applications

36:44.411 --> 36:47.205
when you've turned down
two research grant offers?

36:47.205 --> 36:48.456
I found the papers
in my trash.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.250
Because I don't want
to go back to that.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.210
Okay? I brought you

36:52.210 --> 36:54.337
back to life, and now,
I don't want to go back

36:54.337 --> 36:56.381
to worms and-and mice
and rats and

36:56.381 --> 36:59.968
hoping maybe my work will help
some other scientist

36:59.968 --> 37:02.011
revolutionize medicine
decades from now.

37:02.011 --> 37:04.472
What kind of work
are you doing, exactly?

37:06.266 --> 37:08.810
I'm developing a rapid treatment
for a rare blood disease.

37:08.810 --> 37:11.020
Kyle's girlfriend is sick,

37:11.020 --> 37:13.440
and I want to help repay him
for what he's done for us.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.567
(woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

37:25.702 --> 37:27.412
(sniffles)

37:27.412 --> 37:28.580
(clears throat)

37:35.795 --> 37:37.797
Is it true?

37:39.424 --> 37:40.925
Have you been stealing
from the hospital?

37:40.925 --> 37:42.802
Steph...

37:42.802 --> 37:45.388
Yeah.

37:45.388 --> 37:47.599
#NoFilter.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.601
I can't get my hands
to work lately,

37:49.601 --> 37:52.270
which makes getting the top
off my makeup kind of hard.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.523
But we can talk about eye shadow
after you answer me.

37:55.523 --> 37:59.319
Have you been siphoning hospital
resources for God knows what?

37:59.319 --> 38:02.864
It's... not that simple.

38:02.864 --> 38:04.908
Yes, I've...

38:04.908 --> 38:06.326
gone against hospital policy

38:06.326 --> 38:08.119
to treat people
who can't get health care.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.413
Yeah, well, this isn't
a victimless crime, Kyle!

38:13.458 --> 38:16.961
My dad...

38:16.961 --> 38:20.882
He's been getting so much heat
about supply shortages.

38:20.882 --> 38:23.259
His personal genome machine
getting stolen

38:23.259 --> 38:24.928
out from underneath his nose.

38:27.472 --> 38:29.474
Do you know how much
it's costing him

38:29.474 --> 38:30.850
to keep me alive right now?

38:32.519 --> 38:36.147
How much it would cost
if he lost his fancy insurance?

38:37.732 --> 38:40.485
I, um...

38:40.485 --> 38:42.445
I hadn't thought about that.

38:44.447 --> 38:46.908
I'm gonna return everything.

38:46.908 --> 38:48.493
That's why I'm
here right now.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.245
To apologize.

38:52.372 --> 38:54.916
And to say goodbye.

38:56.376 --> 38:59.379
I am definitely going
to lose my job,

38:59.379 --> 39:01.130
and after I confess
to everything,

39:01.130 --> 39:03.508
they're definitely
gonna press criminal charges.

39:03.508 --> 39:06.135
Yeah, well,
your mom's the sheriff.
Oh, yeah, and if you'd met her,

39:06.135 --> 39:07.720
you'd know that means
I'm really screwed.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.472
(sniffles)

39:09.472 --> 39:11.933
I wish you'd met her.

39:14.394 --> 39:16.980
She'd really love you.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.357
Goodbye, Steph.

39:21.985 --> 39:24.112
Show up for your shift tomorrow.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.740
What?

39:27.740 --> 39:29.617
Yeah, the thing about dying?

39:29.617 --> 39:31.411
Your dad's willing
to do whatever it takes

39:31.411 --> 39:32.704
to make you happy.

39:32.704 --> 39:35.915
And I don't want you
to lose your job, so...

39:35.915 --> 39:37.500
I don't know what to say.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.920
Don't. I'm still mad at you.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.298
Close the door on your way out.

39:51.556 --> 39:54.309
So this is just about Kyle's
girlfriend, and then it's over?

39:56.394 --> 39:59.731
If I can cure her,
the possibilities are endless.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.566
I can adjust it
for other illnesses.

40:01.566 --> 40:04.736
Adjust what, exactly?
Alien DNA?

40:04.736 --> 40:07.447
Liz, my God. Like, let's say
you're right, and you find

40:07.447 --> 40:10.408
some magic cure-all
in alien spinal fluid.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.410
And then that information
falls into the wrong hands?

40:12.410 --> 40:14.621
It won't,
because it's in my hands.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.164
Max, I love you, I love

40:16.164 --> 40:18.875
your family. I-I am asking you
to trust me with this.

40:18.875 --> 40:20.418
No, you're not
asking me anything.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.420
You haven't asked me
about any of this.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.464
You just got caught
in a string of lies.

40:24.464 --> 40:27.467
I guess it sucks, huh,

40:27.467 --> 40:29.302
when your partner
doesn't include you

40:29.302 --> 40:31.220
in major,
life-altering decisions?

40:31.220 --> 40:34.682
Are you angry at me for
bringing your sister back?

40:34.682 --> 40:36.225
Hey.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.895
Liz, we need
to talk.

40:38.895 --> 40:41.481
Rosa, we think
you're right. We think

40:41.481 --> 40:43.858
mom was taken by Flint Manes
as part of some scheme.

40:43.858 --> 40:46.402
Well, there is
new information.

40:47.904 --> 40:50.365
We found this on
Michael's trailer.

40:56.788 --> 40:59.290
Flint didn't abduct my mother.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.209
This is Helena's handwriting.

41:01.209 --> 41:03.211
They're working together.

41:08.883 --> 41:11.678
HELENA:
Hola, Michael.

41:14.097 --> 41:16.265
I'm Helena Ortecho.

41:16.265 --> 41:17.809
Why?

41:17.809 --> 41:20.603
(yells)
What the hell?

41:20.603 --> 41:23.272
It's a special drug developed
at Caulfield.

41:23.272 --> 41:25.274
It won't harm you at all,
but you won't be able

41:25.274 --> 41:27.527
to use any telekinetics
until it wears off.

41:27.527 --> 41:29.237
It'll keep you honest.

41:29.237 --> 41:31.030
I want to see Alex.

41:31.030 --> 41:32.907
Oh.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.617
You will.

41:41.249 --> 41:43.209
After you build me this bomb.
