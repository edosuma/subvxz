WEBVTT

00:13.782 --> 00:17.118
So Naare's heard every word
we've said since Tatooine?

00:17.120 --> 00:20.221
<i>Yeah. That's how she
tracked us all over the galaxy.</i>

00:20.223 --> 00:24.091
Aw! She even knows there's
no crystal on Rodia.

00:24.093 --> 00:26.994
Hey!
My transmission pack!

00:26.996 --> 00:31.932
Ugh! I'm getting the distinct
impression that I'm getting blamed here.

00:31.934 --> 00:36.137
But you guys were the ones who boosted
my transmission signal in the first place.

00:36.139 --> 00:39.774
- So why didn't you turn it off?
- You never told me to!

00:39.776 --> 00:41.976
Plus... I forgot.

00:41.978 --> 00:45.863
- At least Naare can't track us anymore.
- She doesn't need to.

00:45.898 --> 00:48.115
She knows the last Kyber
Saber crystal is on Hoth.

00:48.117 --> 00:51.919
If we go to Hoth, Naare will be
there, waiting to cut us to shreds.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.821
But if we don't go to Hoth,

00:53.823 --> 00:56.857
Naare will search and search and
search until she finds the crystal.

00:56.859 --> 00:59.927
And then the Emperor will cut
the whole galaxy to shreds.

00:59.929 --> 01:03.798
Not a fan of these options.
Anybody got another?

01:03.800 --> 01:06.167
The Maker of Zoh!

01:07.102 --> 01:09.103
<i>The what of where?</i>

01:09.105 --> 01:11.138
Zoh!
We've got to go to Zoh!

01:11.140 --> 01:14.008
Rowan, before I let you
touch any more buttons,

01:14.010 --> 01:16.944
you're gonna need to
explain just a little bit.

01:16.946 --> 01:20.065
Remember that lady on Takodana?
Maz? Well, after she gave

01:20.066 --> 01:23.184
me the crystal, she told me
that when I get desperate,

01:23.186 --> 01:25.853
I should seek out "the Maker of Zoh."

01:25.855 --> 01:29.824
The Maker is just a droid myth
whispered in repair shops.

01:29.826 --> 01:31.125
Zoh.

01:31.127 --> 01:33.828
"An uninhabited garbage planet."

01:33.830 --> 01:36.297
Set course for there!
Do it, do it, do it! Hurry up!

01:36.299 --> 01:39.967
- Why aren't we going?
- What? We don't have any better ideas.

01:39.969 --> 01:43.438
Okay, just to be clear, we're going
to an uninhabited planet, looking

01:43.439 --> 01:46.907
for someone who probably doesn't
exist, because a crazy lady told us to?

01:46.909 --> 01:48.976
<i>- Yup.
- Okay.</i>

01:48.978 --> 01:53.047
Just want to be clear on that.
Setting course for Zoh.

01:59.758 --> 02:03.077
<b>1x10 - "The Maker of Zoh"</b>

02:14.169 --> 02:15.128
<i>So this is it?</i>

02:15.129 --> 02:18.005
We just orbit around this ice
cube till the kid shows up?

02:18.007 --> 02:21.075
Yes. You have something better to do?

02:21.077 --> 02:24.712
If Jabba finds out I'm
sneaking around behind his back,

02:24.714 --> 02:27.582
he's gonna freeze my very
substantial body in carbonite

02:27.583 --> 02:29.979
- and hang me on his wall.
- Patience.

02:30.014 --> 02:32.887
Sooner or later,
the Freemakers will come.

02:32.889 --> 02:35.990
They have nowhere else to go.

02:50.352 --> 02:52.420
What... is this?

02:55.924 --> 02:59.927
An amazing waste of
perfectly good scrap.

03:02.030 --> 03:06.728
Or... the work of the Maker.

03:11.773 --> 03:13.708
Come on! Hurry! Hurry!

03:13.710 --> 03:16.944
Why are you guys so slow?
I've got a good feeling about this!

03:16.946 --> 03:19.680
<i>And my good feelings
are almost never wrong.</i>

03:19.682 --> 03:22.783
Anyone else have the
feeling we're being watched?

03:25.620 --> 03:26.987
- What was that?
- Wind?

03:26.989 --> 03:29.657
Sure.
It was wind. With feet.

03:29.659 --> 03:32.026
And not some terrible
creature that wants to eat us.

03:32.028 --> 03:36.697
This hypothetical creature of
yours... does it eat droids?

03:40.001 --> 03:42.737
Maybe coming here was a mistake.

03:47.843 --> 03:48.976
Yep! Mistake!

03:59.588 --> 04:03.691
- You are trespassing.
- You are not welcome on Zoh.

04:03.693 --> 04:07.061
Hey, Roger? They're droids.
You're a droid.

04:07.063 --> 04:11.866
- Uh, maybe you can talk to them, huh?
- Roger, roger.

04:11.868 --> 04:16.704
Hey, fellow droids. Look, you
don't have to fear these guys.

04:16.706 --> 04:18.706
They like droids.

04:18.708 --> 04:21.709
They're not gonna hurt you.
That's not their thing.

04:21.711 --> 04:25.946
Hmm. Quick question.
What happened to your transmission pack?

04:25.948 --> 04:28.449
Oh. Well, they ripped
it clean off my back,

04:28.450 --> 04:33.921
- but there's a whole story behind that and I...
- Destroy the intruders!

04:33.923 --> 04:35.022
Whoa!

04:40.796 --> 04:42.129
Rowan!

04:43.765 --> 04:45.800
<i>Stop!</i>

04:48.904 --> 04:50.805
<i>Lay down your weapons.</i>

04:52.974 --> 04:55.776
Maker? They're trespassing.

04:55.778 --> 04:58.712
N-3R0, they mean us no harm.

05:02.818 --> 05:05.753
Are you the Maker?

05:05.755 --> 05:08.088
The Maker's more a title
than a name.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.157
Call me Jek.

05:11.993 --> 05:14.762
The Maker's real. Huh.

05:14.764 --> 05:16.096
Sorry about my metal friends.

05:16.098 --> 05:18.799
- They're just a little...
- Shooty-stabby-crushy?

05:18.801 --> 05:21.969
I was going to say "overprotective."

05:21.971 --> 05:24.972
These droids haven't had the
best experiences with people.

05:24.974 --> 05:28.175
A trend that continues
to this very day, Maker.

05:28.177 --> 05:31.846
Look at all the trouble that these
trespassers have already caused!

05:31.848 --> 05:34.915
- You're overreacting.
- Oh, I'm overreacting.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.985
Do you hear what he's saying?
I'm "overreacting."

05:37.987 --> 05:40.054
Well, don't I feel silly.

05:40.055 --> 05:42.122
You're underreacting!

05:42.124 --> 05:44.825
There, there, my friend.
Fixer?

05:51.800 --> 05:52.834
Good as new.

05:52.835 --> 05:55.936
The intruders will force
us all back into servitude.

05:55.938 --> 06:00.207
Or worse, turn us all into scrap!
They must be expelled!

06:00.209 --> 06:03.811
Except this guy. He's all right.

06:03.813 --> 06:07.114
Gosh, thanks! Ow.

06:07.116 --> 06:09.049
Nonsense. They're just kids.

06:09.051 --> 06:11.819
<i>Salvagers, judging by their ship.</i>

06:11.821 --> 06:14.188
Take whatever you
need, then go in peace.

06:16.859 --> 06:20.194
We didn't come to Zoh to
salvage, Mr. Maker, sir.

06:20.196 --> 06:23.797
We came to find someone to
help me learn about the Force.

06:26.968 --> 06:30.070
I came to Zoh to get away from all that.

06:32.073 --> 06:35.843
But it's important.
The fate of the galaxy is at stake!

06:35.845 --> 06:40.214
That's what they always say.
One last battle to end all battles.

06:40.216 --> 06:43.017
But then there's always another.

06:43.019 --> 06:45.185
I thought Jedi protect and help people.

06:45.187 --> 06:48.088
Who said I was a Jedi?

06:48.924 --> 06:52.993
Nobody.
I keep making that mistake.

06:52.995 --> 06:56.864
A Sith tricked me into
using my powers to help her.

06:56.866 --> 07:01.101
Now people will suffer because of me.
Please don't let that happen.

07:01.103 --> 07:05.005
The Sith.
The Sith betrayed me too.

07:05.007 --> 07:08.876
I'm not a Jedi.
I can't train you to be one.

07:08.878 --> 07:11.912
But I can teach you
what I know of the Force.

07:13.114 --> 07:15.282
Looks like we'll be staying a while.

07:15.284 --> 07:17.284
Which might not be so bad.

07:17.286 --> 07:20.054
There's probably some sweet
scrap around here, right?

07:20.056 --> 07:23.190
Oh, yeah, this planet
is crawling with it.

07:25.894 --> 07:28.963
"Scrap."

07:31.316 --> 07:34.284
<i>"Sooner or later, they'll come," 
she says. </i>

07:34.286 --> 07:37.354
I think it's pretty safe to
rule out the "sooner" option.

07:37.356 --> 07:40.157
- Then it will be later.
- "Later."

07:40.159 --> 07:43.327
This is a new frontier in
boredom we're exploring here.

07:43.329 --> 07:47.097
You hear that? I just wish
something would happen. Anything!

07:47.099 --> 07:49.366
<i>- Graballa!
- Ha!</i>

07:49.368 --> 07:51.935
It's not the something I wanted.

07:51.937 --> 07:57.341
- Jabba! My old cuz! How's it...
- _

07:57.343 --> 07:58.843
What am I doing in the Hoth...

07:58.844 --> 08:00.344
Okay, right away with the questions.

08:00.346 --> 08:03.113
No "Hello"? No "How are ya?"
All right, fine.

08:03.115 --> 08:08.018
Well, I was gonna make it a surprise,
'cause I know you like surprises.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.220
You see, there's...
there's these crystals.

08:10.222 --> 08:14.391
_

08:18.129 --> 08:21.899
<i>Naare! What are you
doing in the Hoth system?</i>

08:21.901 --> 08:24.301
_

08:24.303 --> 08:27.104
<i>You're wasting precious time.</i>

08:29.974 --> 08:32.076
<i>And trying my patience!</i>

08:32.078 --> 08:36.046
My lord, I've already found six
of the seven Kyber Saber crystals.

08:36.048 --> 08:39.183
And, Jabba, these crystals,
they're really something.

08:39.184 --> 08:42.019
I beg of you, just a little more time.

08:42.020 --> 08:45.189
And you'll see, this whole
scheme is gonna pay off big time!

08:45.191 --> 08:50.027
<i>Naare, this is all starting to
sound like one big pile of...</i>

08:50.029 --> 08:52.029
<i>Poodoo.</i>

08:52.031 --> 08:54.064
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

08:54.066 --> 08:59.036
Ha! Jabba's squeezing my tail tight!
There's no pleasing that guy.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.305
You ever work for somebody like that?

09:04.075 --> 09:09.079
The dark side, with all its
hatred and rage, destroys.

09:10.048 --> 09:11.415
But the light side...

09:15.080 --> 09:17.121
it builds.

09:18.056 --> 09:19.423
<i>It creates.</i>

09:22.026 --> 09:24.962
- It protects.
- Wow.

09:24.964 --> 09:30.167
- Don't know what that is.
- Now you try.

09:45.483 --> 09:48.218
Sorry. It's barely anything.

09:48.220 --> 09:52.489
I disagree.
It's a start.

09:53.458 --> 09:57.394
Oh, look at it. The trespassers
are corrupting the Maker.

09:57.396 --> 09:59.997
Really?
He looks like he's having fun.

09:59.999 --> 10:03.167
Yes, it's all fun for everyone
until he runs off with them.

10:03.169 --> 10:06.303
And leave our paradise?
He wouldn't.

10:06.305 --> 10:09.106
Don't underestimate the power of fun.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.109
And when he's gone, do you
know what happens to you and me

10:12.111 --> 10:16.346
- and every other droid on this planet?
- Um, I do not.

10:16.348 --> 10:19.449
We're left for scrap!
That's what.

10:19.451 --> 10:22.286
Used and discarded once again.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.354
Do you remember being scrap?

10:24.356 --> 10:29.159
Oh, I do.
I did not like it.

10:29.161 --> 10:30.460
Me neither.

10:30.462 --> 10:34.264
Will you help me bring the
Maker back to us, BL-OX?

10:34.266 --> 10:37.467
Of course. I'll do
anything for the Maker.

10:37.469 --> 10:40.537
That's good to know!
Spread the word.

10:40.539 --> 10:45.442
<i>There's something I need to
do before we make our move.</i>

10:47.111 --> 10:50.280
Ugh! The junk on this planet
falls into three categories...

10:50.282 --> 10:53.317
useless junk, worthless
junk and junky junk.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.552
Fourth category: All of the above.

10:55.554 --> 10:58.388
Hey! This might be something.

11:04.395 --> 11:07.364
Huh, my mistake.
It's just junk.

11:07.366 --> 11:09.533
Roger! You almost squished us!

11:09.535 --> 11:12.469
Well, the key word there is "almost."

11:12.471 --> 11:16.473
- So, what are we doing next?
- Come on.

11:16.475 --> 11:18.508
- Let's search somewhere else.
- Okay!

11:18.510 --> 11:23.347
Roger, um... Hey, it's not that
we don't appreciate the help.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.616
Mm-mmm. We do.

11:24.617 --> 11:27.150
But you know what you
could do to really help?

11:27.152 --> 11:29.219
Go back in the ship and, um...

11:29.221 --> 11:33.010
- Recalibrate the, uh...
- Calibrators.

11:33.045 --> 11:37.227
- Yeah. Recalibrate the calibrators.
- But that makes no sense.

11:37.229 --> 11:40.364
I'd need the calibrators
to recalibrate anything.

11:40.366 --> 11:44.167
Huh, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say you guys were trying to...

11:45.503 --> 11:52.175
- ditch me.
- Trouble with your masters?

11:52.177 --> 11:54.578
They're just angry because
I almost crushed them.

11:54.580 --> 11:58.248
And accidentally let the bad
guys track us all over the galaxy.

11:58.250 --> 12:01.184
And one time, I burned dinner.

12:01.186 --> 12:03.902
- It's... It's one of those things.
- Mmm, humans.

12:03.937 --> 12:07.524
They just don't appreciate us
droids. Never have, never will.

12:07.526 --> 12:13.353
Hey, come with me, Roger.
I know just what you need.

12:16.234 --> 12:22.272
Ah, my joints haven't felt this good
since I slid off the assembly line.

12:22.274 --> 12:24.641
It's paradise.

12:27.312 --> 12:29.646
Oh, thanks, but I better leave that off.

12:29.648 --> 12:32.482
I've gotten into enough
trouble over this thing.

12:34.252 --> 12:36.453
You know, Roger, this spark of a notion

12:36.455 --> 12:39.423
has been zipping around
my processing circuits.

12:39.425 --> 12:44.428
How 'bout you stay here
in paradise with us?!

12:44.430 --> 12:46.630
- Stay?
- Why not?

12:46.632 --> 12:49.466
No more ungrateful
humans bossing you around.

12:49.468 --> 12:52.269
<i>No more taking the
blame for their mistakes.</i>

12:52.271 --> 12:56.273
- But I couldn't leave the Freemakers.
- I know their type, Roger.

12:56.275 --> 12:59.443
They keep you around when
you function properly.

12:59.445 --> 13:04.281
But after a malfunction or two,
it's off to the scrap heap.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.416
They'd never scrap me.

13:10.355 --> 13:13.690
They would.

13:14.659 --> 13:16.693
He won't be a problem.

13:16.695 --> 13:21.501
Now here's what I need you to do.

13:21.599 --> 13:25.335
The key to mastering the Force is focus.

13:25.337 --> 13:28.438
- Can you focus?
- I think so.

13:31.443 --> 13:33.343
But not if you distract me.

13:33.345 --> 13:38.382
There will always be distractions.
I ask again, can you focus?

13:38.716 --> 13:40.650
- Yes.
- Can you?

13:40.652 --> 13:42.619
- Yes!
- Can you?!

13:42.621 --> 13:44.454
Yes!

13:45.557 --> 13:49.526
- How'd I do?
- Not bad.

13:51.696 --> 13:53.630
Worthless. Useless.

13:53.632 --> 13:57.067
Junky.
Worthless. Useless.

13:57.402 --> 14:00.337
Oh! Oh! I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

14:00.339 --> 14:04.307
No harm done.
My construction is solid.

14:04.309 --> 14:09.557
But if you're looking for useful
parts, I know a better place.

14:09.592 --> 14:12.182
Lead the way, my good droid!

14:14.552 --> 14:17.354
<i>Look at all this scrap!</i>

14:17.356 --> 14:20.690
Ahh!
That's the stuff.

14:20.692 --> 14:23.527
Is it weird that I love
that old junk smell?

14:23.529 --> 14:26.329
- Don't bring it up on first dates.
- Solid advice.

14:26.331 --> 14:29.599
Thanks, BL-OX. We can
definitely salvage this stuff.

14:29.601 --> 14:34.031
You won't be salvaging anything.

14:36.674 --> 14:40.824
Because you will be... scrap.

14:43.744 --> 14:46.746
Don't picture the pieces
you're using to build.

14:46.748 --> 14:49.482
Picture what you're building.

14:49.484 --> 14:51.885
Focus on where you're going.

14:51.887 --> 14:54.463
- Ready?
- Hmm.

14:54.498 --> 14:57.421
Then reach out through
the Force and build.

14:58.826 --> 15:02.580
Picture what I'm building...

15:08.569 --> 15:11.705
- Ha! I did it!
- Well done.

15:11.707 --> 15:14.774
- Now the next thing I want to teach you is...
- Whoo-hoo!

15:14.776 --> 15:18.133
Or... okay.

15:23.517 --> 15:27.721
<i>The Maker came to Zoh to
protect himself and us.</i>

15:27.723 --> 15:32.726
Your mere presence has caused
a malfunction in the Maker's mind.

15:32.728 --> 15:34.961
<i>Malfunction! Malfunction!</i>

15:34.963 --> 15:39.733
You will share the fate of
so many discarded droids...

15:39.735 --> 15:42.569
you will be crushed!

15:42.571 --> 15:45.572
- Like, emotionally crushed?
- 'Cause we can get over that.

15:45.574 --> 15:47.974
No! The kind...
Quiet!

15:47.976 --> 15:50.777
<i>Kordi! Zander!</i>

15:50.779 --> 15:54.329
Where are you?
You've gotta see what I built!

15:55.750 --> 15:57.917
Whoa! What's going on?

15:57.919 --> 16:02.622
N-3R0, have you fried your
logic circuits? Release them!

16:02.624 --> 16:05.725
Maker, the trespassers
have corrupted your mind.

16:05.727 --> 16:08.645
We're protecting you.

16:12.767 --> 16:15.001
Remember what I've taught you.

16:15.003 --> 16:19.706
- Trust in yourself and in the Force.
- Drop it!

16:32.987 --> 16:35.689
Yes! I saved them.

16:39.795 --> 16:41.695
Oh!

16:41.697 --> 16:45.898
- Eh, sorta.
- They're safe. That's what counts.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.835
N-3R0 has manipulated the droids.

16:48.837 --> 16:52.639
- Don't hurt them if you can help it.
- Fine.

16:52.641 --> 16:56.429
But if anybody walks into my
lightsaber, it's not my fault!

17:10.657 --> 17:12.058
What was that?

17:21.702 --> 17:23.737
Rowan!

17:33.100 --> 17:36.035
The Maker is beyond saving, hmm.

17:36.037 --> 17:38.171
He'll have to be
scrapped with the others.

17:38.173 --> 17:41.827
Um, N-3R0?
What's going on?

17:41.862 --> 17:44.878
Oh, Roger, you're here. Good!

17:44.880 --> 17:49.148
Just in time to see your former
masters being deactivated.

17:49.150 --> 17:50.984
- Deactivated?
- Yes!

17:50.986 --> 17:53.853
You will be free!
It's better this way.

17:53.855 --> 17:56.990
Remember? No more humans
bossing you around?

17:56.992 --> 17:58.791
No more taking their blame.

18:00.995 --> 18:04.998
Well... isn't that what
happens in families?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.361
You sometimes make mistakes,

18:07.362 --> 18:10.904
<i>but you forgive each other
because you're family.</i>

18:10.906 --> 18:13.039
You still love each other, right?

18:13.041 --> 18:16.876
Roger? Are you saying
that you're with them

18:16.878 --> 18:20.013
and not with us,
your droid brethren?

18:20.015 --> 18:23.082
Well, I'm saying I'm a droid,

18:23.084 --> 18:27.728
but more than that,
I'm a Freemaker!

18:32.761 --> 18:35.028
Am I hearing what I think I'm hearing?

18:35.030 --> 18:37.991
They're on Zoh!
Set course for Zoh!

18:38.026 --> 18:40.767
I give the orders on my ship.

18:40.769 --> 18:43.102
Yeppau, you wanna set course for Zoh?

18:43.104 --> 18:47.941
Ha! You're gonna be sorry
you messed with my family!

18:49.276 --> 18:52.011
Um, any moment now.

18:52.013 --> 18:55.048
If you've got something else
to do, now's a good time.

18:55.050 --> 19:00.887
- Let's, uh, break and regroup later.
- We finish this now!

19:00.889 --> 19:02.088
Uh-oh.

19:02.090 --> 19:06.259
<i>Scrap them! Scrap them!
Scrap them!</i>

19:11.198 --> 19:13.866
It's an invasion!

19:14.868 --> 19:17.503
Sorry. Bringing in the
bad guys was the only thing

19:17.504 --> 19:20.139
I could think to do to
stop the other bad guys.

19:20.141 --> 19:23.209
Roger, that was some genius thinking!

19:23.211 --> 19:27.981
- Or at least, some Freemaker thinking.
- Aw! Thanks, guys!

19:27.983 --> 19:31.150
Family hug later.
Let's get to the ship.

19:33.120 --> 19:36.022
My droids. I have to save them.

19:40.127 --> 19:46.802
No. Intruders, you are not welcome!
You have not been invited!

20:01.115 --> 20:03.016
Hello, Freemakers.

20:03.018 --> 20:05.385
I've been wondering
where you've been hiding.

20:07.921 --> 20:12.859
A trash planet. Perfect.
You blend right in.

20:12.861 --> 20:15.094
You're not gonna hurt my family, Naare.

20:15.096 --> 20:19.017
Do you mean I'll have to hurt
you first before I hurt them?

20:19.052 --> 20:20.299
Because I'm good with that.

20:20.301 --> 20:24.012
Rowan. I'll handle the Sith.
Get to your ship.

20:24.204 --> 20:29.308
- Go!
- The failed experiment.

20:29.310 --> 20:32.749
Jek-14, is it?
I've heard of you.

20:32.784 --> 20:35.943
Better a failure than a pawn of evil.

20:48.062 --> 20:51.264
Anything you build, I can break!

21:02.142 --> 21:05.244
What?

21:10.017 --> 21:13.166
- Jek!
- Trust in the Force!

21:13.921 --> 21:16.422
Be a builder, Rowan!

21:18.425 --> 21:21.994
- Jek!
- Come on! It's too late!

21:30.437 --> 21:34.107
There's one crystal left,
and we're going to get it.

21:34.109 --> 21:37.590
<i>You hear me, Naare?
We're going to get it!</i>

21:37.625 --> 21:39.145
Hit it.

21:43.050 --> 21:47.019
- Set course for Hoth!
- My ship!

21:47.421 --> 21:49.768
Just do, yeah, what she said.

22:01.034 --> 22:04.370
What? Where am I?
All I remember is a big flash.

22:05.372 --> 22:09.827
Oh, a restraining bolt?
Why?

22:09.862 --> 22:13.246
Hmm. We never should
have listened to you.

22:13.248 --> 22:16.082
We should have had faith
in the Maker.

22:16.084 --> 22:21.043
<i>We'll never see another
being like him again.</i>
