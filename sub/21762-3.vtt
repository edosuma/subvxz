[screams in panic]

01:14.074 --> 01:15.200

01:15.283 --> 01:18.119
It was just a freaky-deaky dream
within a dream.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.998
Still, I should have Clover
shark-proof this room.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.375
Yes, you're right.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.628

I ever saw my parents.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.882
Oh, well, now that you mention it,

01:29.965 --> 01:32.843
I suppose their disappearance
has kinda, sorta

01:32.927 --> 01:35.512
haunted me relentlessly
every day of my life.

01:36.095 --> 01:39.516
But they're here now!
I don't think they're ever leaving.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.979
Mother! Big Papi!

01:44.063 --> 01:47.024
-I'm so excited you guys are back!
-[both squeal]

01:47.106 --> 01:49.651
Ugh, yes, good to see you too, old boy.

01:49.735 --> 01:53.488
As you know, your mother and I have...
obligations elsewhere.

01:54.073 --> 01:55.115
What do you mean?

01:55.198 --> 01:56.825
Maurice, what do they mean?

01:56.909 --> 01:57.743
[clears throat]

01:57.826 --> 02:01.580
Your parents and I have negotiated
our agreement for their monthly allowance.

02:01.663 --> 02:05.751
Everything should be in order by tomorrow
and they are free to go.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.754
You're... leaving? [sobs]

02:08.837 --> 02:12.549
-Your Majesty, are you all right?
-[blows raspberry] What a silly question!

02:12.633 --> 02:16.637
Of course I'm all right.
My parents who I haven't seen in years

02:16.720 --> 02:19.890
are leaving before I've even
gotten to know them.

02:19.974 --> 02:21.642
Why wouldn't I be all right?

02:21.725 --> 02:23.560
All right! Why?

02:23.644 --> 02:26.105
Tell me! Please,
'cause I really want to know, Maurice!

02:26.229 --> 02:29.316
Oh, now. Stiff upper lip, old boy.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.611
Can't have you blubbering
like some Italian widow.

02:32.694 --> 02:33.904

02:33.988 --> 02:36.824
But, you haven't even tried
the waterslide.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.660
You can't leave
without getting your butts wet.

02:40.201 --> 02:43.163
There, there. We've had a wonderful time.

02:43.246 --> 02:46.959
Truly. But we hate it here
and wish to leave.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.043
-Mark?
-[rings bell]

02:48.127 --> 02:52.673
[grumbles] It's "Maurice."
And I'm standing right here.

02:52.756 --> 02:56.175
Please pack our things so we may go.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.971
Huh. [sarcastically]
I thought you'd never ask.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.555
Maurice!

03:00.639 --> 03:02.432
I know saying goodbye is hard,

03:02.516 --> 03:07.437
but trust me, everybody will be happier
when they're gone. And I mean everybody.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.606
Like, literally everybody.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.858
Everybody!

03:10.941 --> 03:11.859
Even Willie?

03:11.942 --> 03:12.860
Everybody.

03:12.943 --> 03:13.944
Even Dorothy?

03:14.028 --> 03:15.320
Everybody!

03:15.403 --> 03:16.363
Even Hector?

03:16.446 --> 03:18.907
Every-- Actually,
Hector really seems to like them.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.951
But other than Hector, everybody!

03:21.035 --> 03:22.327
I understand.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.872
You're not going.

03:24.955 --> 03:25.831
-What?
-What?

03:25.914 --> 03:28.625
You are not getting your allowance

03:28.709 --> 03:32.504
until you... read me a bedtime story.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.840
I have no idea what that is,

03:34.923 --> 03:38.719
but it sounds like it requires us
to do something.

03:38.802 --> 03:42.472
I want a bedtime story
like I never got as a child.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.893
I read you a bedtime story
every night when we were kids.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.103
And a couple of nights last week.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.021
[grumbles]

03:49.104 --> 03:52.440
Maurice! This is a family
A-B conversation.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.943
So could you family C your way out of it?

03:55.485 --> 03:56.737
Huh? Oh.

03:57.487 --> 04:01.950
You're reading me a bedtime story!
I'm the king, that's the law!

04:02.034 --> 04:02.868
Shaboosh!

04:03.535 --> 04:05.204
"And then the wolf says,

04:05.286 --> 04:07.414
'All the better to see you with.'"

04:07.497 --> 04:08.540
Cut! Cut!

04:08.916 --> 04:10.584
It's all wrong. Where's the passion?

04:10.667 --> 04:13.294
This is the Big Bad Wolf
we're talking about here, peoples!

04:13.378 --> 04:15.923
We need to feel the bigness
and the badness!

04:16.006 --> 04:18.884
Going again from the top. Back to one.
Eh... Ugh.

04:19.968 --> 04:23.764
"'Grandmother, what big teeth you have!'

04:23.847 --> 04:29.144
And the wicked wolf replied,
'All the better to eat you up with!'"

[laughs maniacally]

04:30.437 --> 04:33.815
[gasps] Oh, snap!
Girl, that ain't your grandmother!

04:33.899 --> 04:36.484
Get up out that house!
Get up out that house!

[Clover grunting]

Your Majesty, I've been looking
all over for you.

04:43.867 --> 04:47.579
And you found me here
in the place that I live.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.958
[sarcastically] Wow. Way to close
the big case, detective.

Ooh. Aha!

04:57.089 --> 04:59.674
You have a full slate of royal activities
this week.

04:59.758 --> 05:00.675
Hold, please.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.428
Important state business
I have to see to immediately.

05:03.511 --> 05:06.098
Postpone all my royal activities.

Oh, Barty! You simply must try this, dear.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.980

-Whee!

next to this cliff?

I can't believe
we've never played catch before.

[groans]

06:08.994 --> 06:10.204
Imagine that.

06:10.287 --> 06:13.207
Give me a long one, Papi.
I want to go deep.

Deep it is.

-Are you injured, old sport?
-[groaning]

06:23.925 --> 06:25.760
Oh, dear! Do you have a fever?

06:25.844 --> 06:26.928
[sighs in relief]

06:27.012 --> 06:28.763
You're touching me, Mommy?

06:28.847 --> 06:32.184
Of course, sweetie. Just don't expect me
to make a habit of it.

06:32.267 --> 06:36.313
We're just glad our little
captain of industry is A-OK.

06:36.395 --> 06:40.067
You're resting your hand on my arm, Papi!

06:40.150 --> 06:42.527
Yes, well, in all the excitement

06:42.610 --> 06:45.655
I seem to have misplaced
my touching stick.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.409
Ever since King Julien
reunited with his parents

06:50.493 --> 06:52.371
-it's like there's nothing to do.
-[Mort humming]

06:52.453 --> 06:55.290
It's quite amazing how much
of our time is spent

06:55.374 --> 06:58.501
keeping him out of trouble
and cleaning up his messes.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.213
I still don't like him
getting this close with his parents.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.798
Sadly, not much we can do about it.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.800
We could get rid of them.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.719
Make it look like an accident?

07:07.802 --> 07:08.887
I know a guy...

07:08.970 --> 07:12.099
No, Mort, we're not... [sighs]
What is wrong with you?

07:12.182 --> 07:13.808
Probably lots of stuff.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.145
Maybe this free time will be good for us.

07:17.229 --> 07:18.563
We can do the things
we've never had time to do

07:18.646 --> 07:21.275
because we're too busy
protecting King Julien from himself.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.735
-Like what?
-I don't know. Hobbies.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.863
Catching up with friends
and family and stuff.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.866
I like to make wigs out of stolen hair.

07:29.950 --> 07:33.245
[sighs] Unfortunately, my hobby
as far as I can remember

07:33.328 --> 07:37.999
has been taking care of King Julien.
He's pretty much the only family I've got.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.919
And I've outlived
all my relatives! [giggles]

07:41.002 --> 07:44.589
Okay, forget family.
We're all friends, we should hang out.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.925
I heard about this great show tonight
we could go to.

community theater? [chuckles]

Gouge out his eyes!
Gouge 'em, you Pollyanna!

07:58.186 --> 07:59.396
[Mort] Kill him!

08:01.315 --> 08:02.482
-Hu-ya!
-[groans]

08:02.565 --> 08:05.193
They're hurting each other
for our enjoyment.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.952
Yeah! [laughs] Yeah!

08:14.035 --> 08:15.829
Okay, it's been fun bonding,

08:15.912 --> 08:17.956
but it looks like the show's over.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.833
-Dang. Just when it was getting good.
-[giggling]

08:19.916 --> 08:22.169
Looks like the next match is starting.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.798
-Well, ahem. Wish me luck.
-Eh...

-Did you know Clover was fighting tonight?
-Yeah...

No. Wait, who's Clover?

[crowd gasps]

08:48.403 --> 08:50.071
Oh, my...

08:50.155 --> 08:52.115
I think I had a little accident.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.074
Hmm?

08:53.408 --> 08:54.868
A big accident.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.372
I had fun today.

08:58.455 --> 09:02.501
With practice, you two could be
totally out-of-control party monsters.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.752
Yes, today was, uh...

09:04.836 --> 09:07.506
not the worst day of my life either.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.341
Aw, you really mean it?

09:09.424 --> 09:12.177
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me!

09:12.760 --> 09:14.221
Sleep tight, dear.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.391
Well, the boy's a good egg.

09:17.474 --> 09:21.520
Yes. Though I fear he may become attached,
if we stay much longer.

09:21.602 --> 09:25.482
We should hurry to collect our
allowance from that nincompoop Mark.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.400
Maurice!

09:27.234 --> 09:29.652
-Did you hear something?
-Never mind that.

09:29.736 --> 09:33.490
By this time tomorrow,
we'll be back to our fabulous lives.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.617
And we'll never have to interact
with these... ugh...

[humming]

10:10.651 --> 10:11.570
Huh?

10:11.652 --> 10:14.239
[continues humming]

10:18.618 --> 10:19.702
Seriously?

10:19.786 --> 10:22.581
You care about his dancing, but not mine?

10:22.997 --> 10:24.124
Watch me dance!

10:24.374 --> 10:25.250
Please!

10:25.666 --> 10:27.544
It's all I ever wanted from you.

10:27.668 --> 10:30.880
[humming]

10:34.759 --> 10:35.594
[exclaims]

10:36.386 --> 10:37.262
[screams]

10:37.345 --> 10:41.057
[panting]

10:43.560 --> 10:44.685
[sighs in relief]

10:45.145 --> 10:45.979
No shark.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.148
-[roars]
-[screams]

10:48.231 --> 10:49.816
[panting]

10:51.151 --> 10:55.196
I've called you here today
because I had a crazy dream last night.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.032
No good conversation
has ever started this way.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.994
Oh-ooh! Was I in your dream? Hmm?

11:01.077 --> 11:02.787
Unfortunately, you were.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.831
What? Do you really mean--

11:05.165 --> 11:07.750
I... [stammering]

11:07.834 --> 11:10.629
I'm okay. I just need...

11:10.711 --> 11:12.213
to take a knee.

11:12.547 --> 11:13.381
Ah-oh...

11:13.507 --> 11:15.300
So, because of this dream,

11:15.383 --> 11:18.595
I've had a brilliant idea
in my mind junks.

11:18.677 --> 11:22.681
An idea so ginormously epic,
it will make up for every moment

11:22.765 --> 11:25.602
of my life that my parents ever missed.

11:25.684 --> 11:29.897
We're gonna re-create the dance recital
they missed when I was a kid!

11:30.440 --> 11:33.193
[mimicking] "Oh, man,
that's great idea, King Julien!"

11:33.276 --> 11:36.863
"You're really handsome, smart
and everyone looks up to you!"

11:36.946 --> 11:39.073
"You inspire me every day!"

11:39.157 --> 11:41.784
Okay. Calm down, everybody.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.578
You're embarrassing the king.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.705
Perhaps seeing your son
dropping booty to the floor

11:46.789 --> 11:49.209
and making the ground quake
will help you to realize

11:49.292 --> 11:51.710
this is where you were meant to be.

11:51.794 --> 11:52.671
With me.

11:52.753 --> 11:53.754
[Maurice clears throat]

11:53.838 --> 11:57.175
You two are probably looking forward
to getting back to your lives, right?

11:57.300 --> 11:59.718
Away from all us normal lemurs.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.431
Well... I suppose if that's what's
important to you,

12:03.515 --> 12:07.352
we could watch you...
"drop booty to the floor."

12:07.435 --> 12:12.190
And it's not as if we can go anywhere
until our finances are squared away.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.068
Yes, yes, bring on the "ground quake"!

12:15.151 --> 12:16.069
Huzzah!

12:16.152 --> 12:21.408
Perfect! Mo-Mo, this performance has to be
special if it's gonna impress my parents.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.077
I need the best choreographer
in the kingdom.

12:25.203 --> 12:28.289
I'll be honest,
I'm gonna do what I can to train you.

12:28.373 --> 12:32.293
But I'm a choreographer,
not a dad-gum professor at wizard school!

12:32.377 --> 12:35.589
I cannot do actual magic. I can't!

12:35.672 --> 12:37.632
Let's see what I'm working with.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.217
You got weird thumbs.

12:39.593 --> 12:42.721
The way you're standing right now
makes me wanna puke and sit in it.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.389
You smell like ear wax!

12:44.472 --> 12:46.600
Your feet are ridiculously small.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.185
[Julien giggling]

12:49.269 --> 12:50.186
Whoa!

12:50.270 --> 12:54.815
And you. I see a lot of potential in you,
is something I would never say!

12:54.899 --> 12:57.818
Because you're awful!
Five, six, seven, eight!

13:01.780 --> 13:04.783
Do you think King Julien's parents
will show up this time?

13:04.867 --> 13:06.119
I sure hope so.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.663
They've made it clear the only thing
keeping them here

13:08.747 --> 13:10.373
is their monthly allowance.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.999
But if you don't give them their allowance

13:12.083 --> 13:15.211
until after the dance recital,
they'll have to attend.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.423
Exactly. And this guy's
got that under control.

13:18.506 --> 13:21.342
They aren't getting a thing
until I say so.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.762
Up top! Maurice for the win! Yeah!

13:23.844 --> 13:26.139
Mort, I've already told you everything.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.599
Please, King Julien.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.934
I must hear more about this dream.

13:30.017 --> 13:33.854
You danced around and made everyone
uncomfortable with how weird you are.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.814
Ah! Pretty crazy, huh?

13:35.898 --> 13:38.817
You dreaming about me.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.655
My, how the tables have turned.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.698
[laughs] Huh? [groans]

13:43.782 --> 13:47.201
-Maurice, I have good news.
-You've called off the recital?

13:47.285 --> 13:49.287
I said "good news," Maurice,

13:49.370 --> 13:53.458
not "the most horrible tragedy
that has ever happened to our kingdom."

13:53.874 --> 13:57.378
Maurice, how could you even
suggest such a thing? Ow!

13:57.462 --> 13:58.837
You know how you've been dragging
your feet

13:58.921 --> 14:02.300
on getting my parents'
monthly mango allowance sorted out?

14:02.383 --> 14:04.344
Well, I took care of it.

14:04.427 --> 14:05.844
Why would you do that?

14:05.928 --> 14:08.556
They asked me to
because you were taking too long.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.518
Your Majesty, that was a huge mistake!

14:11.601 --> 14:16.189
Well, I'm sorry if we're not all
Stingy Stephanies like you, Maurice!

14:16.272 --> 14:18.316
But they said they really needed
those free mangoes

14:18.399 --> 14:21.986
to support their extravagant,
child-free lifestyle, whatever that means.

14:22.069 --> 14:25.323
Your parents are only staying here
long enough to get their allowance.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.741
I heard them say it last night.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.036
Wait. You're saying,

14:30.119 --> 14:33.122
the only reason my parents
are spending time with me

14:33.206 --> 14:36.543
is so they can get their mangoes
and move on?

14:36.626 --> 14:38.085
I'm sorry, King Julien.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.213
Wow. Really?

14:40.296 --> 14:41.964
You're so threatened by them

14:42.048 --> 14:44.008
that you'd make up all this drama

14:44.091 --> 14:46.302
to drive a wedge between us?

14:46.386 --> 14:47.220
Uh... ugh...

14:47.303 --> 14:48.805
Pretty low, Maurice.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.057
Even for you. Ow!

14:51.140 --> 14:54.435
King Julien, Maurice might be right.

14:54.519 --> 14:55.687
[exclaims in disgust]

14:55.770 --> 14:57.605
You too, Clover?

14:57.689 --> 15:00.983
I'm surrounded by haters,
doubters and second-guessers!

15:01.067 --> 15:03.486
I am not a hater, King Julien.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.987
I am a lover.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.824
[grumbling] Mort, that's almost worse!

15:08.533 --> 15:11.285
[screaming] Ow, ow, ow, ow...

15:11.369 --> 15:13.162
[groans in pain] Ow!

15:13.246 --> 15:15.373
My parents love me!

15:15.456 --> 15:18.000
And if you two are jealous, too bad.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.335
I don't need you.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.088
I'm a grown-up lemur
with a mommy and daddy

15:22.171 --> 15:24.507
who love him and read him stories!

15:24.591 --> 15:26.634
[stammers] You've got this all wrong.

15:26.718 --> 15:29.387
No, Maurice, you've got it all wronger!

15:29.470 --> 15:31.138
They'll be at my recital.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.266
[Barty grunting]

15:36.477 --> 15:37.520
[screams]

15:39.188 --> 15:41.775
-Mark?
-My name's not Mark!

15:41.858 --> 15:44.861
Barty, what's Mark doing here?
Did we ring the bell?

15:44.944 --> 15:48.615
[laughs] Old sport, if this is about
the little soaps and shampoo bottles

15:48.698 --> 15:51.492
and the robes and the selection
of mixed nuts we took from the room,

15:51.576 --> 15:54.328
I'll have you know we believed
those were gifts.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.457
While you're here,
perhaps you could lend a hand in packing.

15:57.540 --> 16:00.251
We need to get these... into these.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.086
As quickly as possible, Mark.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.256
You can't leave until after
you watch King Julien dance.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.800
This was special to him.

16:06.883 --> 16:11.554
He went to a choreographer and everything.
She hit him. Like, a bunch of times.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.682
Oh, the boy's been fine without us
all these years.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.350
I doubt he'll even notice.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.770
He's pulled himself up by the bootstraps

16:18.853 --> 16:23.149
and made something of himself.
A true riches-to-more-riches story.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.108
[laughs]

16:24.191 --> 16:25.234
I'm begging you.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.320
Please stay for Julien's recital.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.489
It would mean the world to him.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.449
Well, when you put it that way,

16:31.532 --> 16:35.202
what choice do we possibly have
but to say...

16:35.286 --> 16:37.413
no, it's still a no.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.917
Wha-what-what!
Da-da-dub-dub-dub-DJ Glitterbuns!

16:41.000 --> 16:46.297
If y'all are ra-rup-rup-ready
to get funky! Make some noise!

16:46.380 --> 16:48.549
-[crowd cheering loudly]
-[upbeat music playing]

16:48.633 --> 16:51.135
I can't hear you!

16:51.218 --> 16:54.221
[electronic voice]
It's an invasion, you snitches!

16:54.305 --> 16:55.974
[horn blaring]

16:58.434 --> 16:59.393
[sighs]

16:59.477 --> 17:01.270
They're not coming, are they?

17:01.855 --> 17:02.981
[both sigh]

17:03.063 --> 17:05.065
They said they would be here.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.651
Why would they get the royal hopes up

17:06.734 --> 17:10.279
and then stomp
all over the royal dreams? [whimpers]

17:10.363 --> 17:12.406
I'm sorry, King Julien.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.074
Me, too. [sniffles]

17:14.659 --> 17:16.703
-Well, I'll go scatter the crowd.
-[sighs]

17:17.286 --> 17:19.956
No, my peoples came to see me
stomp the yard,

17:20.039 --> 17:23.835
and it would not be very kingly of me
to leave the yard un-stomped.

17:24.752 --> 17:25.920
[grumbles]

17:26.004 --> 17:28.047
You ready, King Julien?

17:28.130 --> 17:29.340
I don't know.

17:29.423 --> 17:32.969
Bless your heart,
but I wasn't really asking.

17:33.052 --> 17:37.015
You get out there right now
or you're gettin' the paddle!

17:37.640 --> 17:39.600
[indistinct chattering]

17:42.436 --> 17:43.604
[sighs]

17:45.023 --> 17:47.191
[humming]

17:49.318 --> 17:50.236
[whimpering]

17:54.615 --> 17:55.658
[screams]

17:55.742 --> 17:56.659
[Mort humming]

17:57.827 --> 17:59.370
Oh-ho...

17:59.453 --> 18:00.663
Hoo-- Shark!

18:00.747 --> 18:01.622
Oh...

18:03.416 --> 18:04.458
[groans] Oh...

18:07.127 --> 18:08.421
[whimpering]

18:10.214 --> 18:11.591
Whoa! Argh!

18:13.718 --> 18:15.428
[crowd murmuring]

18:17.555 --> 18:20.224
[sobbing]

18:21.475 --> 18:23.269
This is not what we practiced.

18:23.352 --> 18:26.064
Get back out there
or I will put you up for adoption!

18:26.146 --> 18:27.023
What?

18:27.356 --> 18:28.858
It's how I motivate Todd.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.193
But seriously, you're embarrassing me!

18:31.778 --> 18:35.073
I can't do it with my parents'
empty chairs out there.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.324
Look again, honey, they ain't empty.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.078
-Yay!
-Mwah!

18:40.160 --> 18:41.996
Huh? Aww.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.333
Yay! Yeah...

18:46.417 --> 18:48.002
[funk music playing]

18:48.878 --> 18:50.546
[humming]

18:53.382 --> 18:54.550
[crowd cheering]

19:02.475 --> 19:04.060
[upbeat music playing]

19:10.524 --> 19:12.735
[laughing]

19:15.696 --> 19:17.115
Ah. Ah, ah.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.745
Huh? Uh...

19:24.038 --> 19:25.581
-[screams]
-[crashes]

19:25.665 --> 19:26.833
Eh, yay!

19:26.958 --> 19:29.127
[crowd cheering]

19:30.128 --> 19:32.130
[exclaims] Aha-ha-ha!

19:33.006 --> 19:34.298
That was fantastic.

19:34.381 --> 19:39.137
Your performance got a bit inappropriate
in the middle, but otherwise, fantastic.

19:39.219 --> 19:42.056
Don't listen to her,
the middle was the best part.

19:42.140 --> 19:45.559
Hey. Did I get eaten by a shark earlier?

19:45.643 --> 19:47.645
Thanks for being there for me, you guys.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.272
Making that booty clap
just wouldn't mean as much

19:50.356 --> 19:52.150
without you there to share it.

19:52.232 --> 19:55.028
I'm sorry you didn't get
the kind of family you deserve.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.030
You're right. I didn't.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.238
I got you guys.

19:58.322 --> 20:02.785
Oh. You're the best family
a king could ever have hoped for.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.913
-[Mort screams]
-You make me tingly all over, for reals.

20:05.997 --> 20:06.873
Especially you.

20:06.956 --> 20:07.957
Hmm?

20:08.041 --> 20:09.792
When I was up there on that stage today,

20:09.876 --> 20:12.795
I realized you've always
been there for me,

20:12.879 --> 20:15.173
even when my parents weren't.

20:16.423 --> 20:17.633
What's everybody looking at?

20:17.717 --> 20:20.386
Are your eyes getting
a bit moist, Maurice?

20:20.469 --> 20:23.764
Oh, you getting a little lump
in your throat, buddy?

20:23.848 --> 20:24.724
No. Why?

20:24.932 --> 20:26.726
Whoa, hey. [chuckles]

20:26.809 --> 20:28.811
If you're trying to imply
that I'm overly emotional

20:28.895 --> 20:31.355
or that I cry at the drop
of a hat, then...

20:31.438 --> 20:33.691
[giggling] Guys, guys, check it.

20:33.774 --> 20:34.692
Say, Mo-Mo?

20:34.775 --> 20:37.611
Did I tell you that I had
a near death experience

20:37.695 --> 20:39.405
when the Mega Gecko exploded?

20:39.530 --> 20:40.573
Oh, yeah!

20:40.656 --> 20:45.036
Your face was the last thing I saw
before I lost consciousness.

20:45.119 --> 20:46.328
My dying wish?

20:46.412 --> 20:51.792
That I could hear your laughter
just one last time.

20:52.835 --> 20:56.089
[cries loudly]

20:56.172 --> 20:58.091
There! You happy?

20:58.174 --> 20:59.717
You got me crying!

20:59.800 --> 21:01.552
[continues crying]

21:01.635 --> 21:03.137
What do you want from me?

21:03.221 --> 21:05.181
I'm an emotional lemur!

21:05.264 --> 21:06.933
I have feelings!

21:07.016 --> 21:08.142
[giggling]

21:08.226 --> 21:10.186
Maurice has feelings.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.437
[laughs]

21:11.520 --> 21:13.106
Your Majesty, I know it...

21:13.189 --> 21:14.107
[clears throat]

21:14.190 --> 21:16.734
I know it hurts
that your parents are gone,

21:16.817 --> 21:19.570
but, personally, I'm very happy

21:19.653 --> 21:24.617
we won't be seeing Barty and Julienne
for a very long time.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.659
-Huh?
-Huh?

21:25.743 --> 21:26.702
Eh...

21:27.245 --> 21:29.413
Mother? Big Papi?

21:29.496 --> 21:30.831
You came back!

21:30.915 --> 21:34.043
Your jitterbugging was tip-top out there,
old boy!

21:34.127 --> 21:35.461
Oh, thank the gods!

21:35.544 --> 21:37.337
If you had missed the recital,

21:37.421 --> 21:39.966
it would have been completely meaningless.

21:40.049 --> 21:43.427
What about all that stuff you just said
about us being your family?

21:43.510 --> 21:46.264
That was back when I thought
they were gone forever.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.849
Now they're back, and I'm free to blow off

21:48.933 --> 21:51.018
the valuable lesson I just learned.

21:51.102 --> 21:54.897
We forgot a few items.
But then we thought, while we're here,

21:54.981 --> 21:58.943
we may as well attend this pointless thing
our son is excited about.

21:59.026 --> 22:02.029
So we slipped in the back
and saw the whole shebang.

22:02.113 --> 22:04.782
We realized if our son
wants to debase himself

22:04.865 --> 22:08.327
like some Vaudeville guttersnipe,
we need to respect that.

22:08.410 --> 22:09.369
Well, that's great.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.872
I guess you can just be
on your way, then. Buh-bye!

22:11.956 --> 22:15.168
No! We thought
we might extend our holiday.

22:15.251 --> 22:16.877
I don't know.

22:16.961 --> 22:20.923
King Julien's pretty busy.
And I'm sure you guys have a lot of...

22:21.048 --> 22:22.675
nothing to get back to.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.593
Oh! Bring it in!

22:24.677 --> 22:27.138
[both groaning]

22:27.221 --> 22:28.388
Little less.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.516
Not so good. Okay, that's enough.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.769
Oh. You gotta be kidding me.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.271
[giggling]

22:36.354 --> 22:38.398
[jazz music plays]
