WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
-Hmm.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.000
Quite specific.

00:33.240 --> 00:35.400
Come on, Eugene. Just get to the boobs.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.760
Wait a minute, please! Merci.

01:05.840 --> 01:06.960
What the fuck?

01:10.720 --> 01:11.920
What the fuck?

01:12.800 --> 01:13.880
I… I'm sorry.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.640
My boyfriend referred to my vagina
as a "lady flower."

01:17.600 --> 01:18.960
Dump him immediately.

01:25.360 --> 01:26.520
Ah, merci.

01:29.720 --> 01:33.360
We are at Beaumont-Hamel,
a preserved battlefield of the Somme.

01:33.880 --> 01:37.080
British troops suffered
over 19,000 fatalities here

01:37.160 --> 01:40.240
on their first day, making it
one of the bloodiest days

01:40.320 --> 01:41.800
in British Army history.

01:42.360 --> 01:43.440
Mr. Hendricks.

01:43.520 --> 01:47.320
Thank you, Miss Sands. Now, some rules.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.600
"Rules? But you're the fun one."

01:49.680 --> 01:53.680
I know, Ruby, I am,
but from now on, no more Mr. Nice Guy.

01:54.200 --> 01:57.640
Okay, so Miss Sands
will now divide you into groups.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.040
Did you hear about Ruby?

01:59.120 --> 02:01.640
I know. Can you imagine
getting dumped by Otis Milburn?

02:01.720 --> 02:05.320
During that time,
I want your full uniforms on.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.320
The entire time.

02:07.400 --> 02:11.360
I don't wanna see any loose ties.
We're representing the school today, guys.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.560
-So that means no drama.
-Otis, these guys.

02:13.640 --> 02:16.480
-No, miss, he can't be in our group.
-He's a twat.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.960
It's fine, miss.
It's the least I could do.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.320
After all, I did break his heart.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.320
Oh, that would make
a lot more sense, actually.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.720
Uh, miss, will I get to hold a gun?

02:27.800 --> 02:31.520
No. You've already asked.
You won't get to hold a bomb either.

02:37.040 --> 02:37.880
Eric, no.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.160
-You cannot wear that.
-Why not? It's just my tracksuit.

02:41.240 --> 02:44.080
You don't want to draw attention
to yourself in Nigeria.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.160
It's dangerous for you.
It's not like here.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.960
What do you mean for me, Mum?

02:49.040 --> 02:50.600
You know what I mean.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.640
Go and change now.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.280
Come on! I want everyone packed
in the next half an hour!

03:14.040 --> 03:16.720
I wish I was in your group.
I don't know those guys.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.720
You'll be okay.
And it's good to make new friends.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.040
Now, off you go, you silly sausage.

03:24.560 --> 03:28.360
I know this is bad, but Steve
is making me feel so arachnophobic.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.000
Do you mean claustrophobic?

03:30.080 --> 03:32.080
Arachnophobic means
you're scared of spiders.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.640
Oh! No, I love spiders.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.520
-I love their hairy legs.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.600
-How many people died here, do you think?

03:39.120 --> 03:40.000
A lot.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.680
-What were they fighting over?
-That's a good question.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.000
How's your new best pal, Hope?

03:47.520 --> 03:49.840
-She's just checking in.
-She's just using you.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.920
Well, I'm using her too.
That's how you get ahead in life.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.920
-Okay. If you're cool with that.
-I am.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.720
-Lt. Marchetti!
-Oh!

03:56.800 --> 03:58.640
-Your country needs you.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.880
-Hey, Viv.
-Hey, Cal.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.440
Come to the student forum
and talk about the uniform thing.

04:03.520 --> 04:07.360
-You clearly feel strongly about it.
-Oh, thank you, but no thank you.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.760
Other students would benefit
from the issue being raised.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.520
Well, then they can raise it.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.560
Race you to the top. Three, two, one, go!

04:22.880 --> 04:23.880
Ruby, can we talk?

04:23.960 --> 04:26.080
Don't look at her. Don't speak to her.
Don't breathe.

04:26.160 --> 04:29.480
-I'm trying to apologize.
-Stop talking. It's triggering for Ruby.

05:09.480 --> 05:12.120
Jakob,
I'll wait for you in the car.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.040
Yeah, yeah, coming.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.280
Hi, I'm Hope Haddon.
I'm here to see Dr. O'Dern.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.480
Jean Milburn.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.400
Yes.

05:32.000 --> 05:32.960
I'm Hope.

05:33.560 --> 05:37.040
-New head teacher at Moordale.
-Yes. I know who you are.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.200
You must be exhausted.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.240
New hit book and a baby on the way.

05:41.320 --> 05:44.240
Yes, it is a bit full-on at the minute,
but I like to keep busy.

05:45.160 --> 05:48.240
How are you enjoying
the transition to Moordale?

05:48.760 --> 05:52.120
A lot of things needed addressing,
as I'm sure you're aware.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.160
You deal with some of it in your book.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.200
Oh, you've read it.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.320
I skimmed.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.320
It's an interesting take,

05:59.400 --> 06:02.920
but we have different perspectives
when it comes to teaching children.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.240
Yes. I've seen your new SRE curriculum.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.600
It looks a lot like
you're advocating abstinence to me.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.920
It isn't so much about abstinence
as it is about restraint,

06:15.000 --> 06:16.840
which I think is an important attribute,

06:16.920 --> 06:20.040
particularly for teenagers
who should be focusing on their education.

06:20.120 --> 06:24.120
Unfortunately, restraint doesn't mix
very well with raging hormones.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.240
I think that's giving teenagers
less credit than they're due.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.640
Sorry. I gave you the wrong form.
This one's for the older mummies.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.040
-It was lovely to meet you.
-Yes.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.600
If you're open
to discussing this further,

06:39.680 --> 06:43.640
I'd be very interested
in telling you more about my perspective.

06:43.720 --> 06:46.200
Okay.
I'll see if I can find some time.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.440
Fantastic.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.720
A bit awkward, isn't it?

06:52.800 --> 06:54.720
I'm currently with your ex-girlfriend,

06:54.800 --> 06:57.280
and, you know,
you stole Rahim's boyfriend.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.840
That's what I mean by awkward, you know?

07:01.320 --> 07:04.880
I thought if I said it out loud,
it'd make it less tense, but it didn't.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.280
I dated Aimee as well.
Should we check out these trenches?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.920
I, uh, I didn't steal your boyfriend.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.920
That's exactly what you did.

07:20.960 --> 07:23.240
-I really liked Aimee, you know?
-Oh yeah?

07:23.320 --> 07:26.200
She was really nice.
And a total fuck machine.

07:26.720 --> 07:29.040
-You're a lucky guy.
-That's so inappropriate.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.720
-Shrooms?
-No, thanks.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.360
Why did you say no to Viv
about the uniform thing?

07:33.440 --> 07:35.600
What's the point?
Not like it would change anything.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.120
-Well, you could try. Maybe Hope might--
-Dude.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.240
Let's just have fun. Okay?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.600
Mushrooms, anybody?

07:44.680 --> 07:46.120
-Oh. Ooh!
-Oh.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.680
What do you reckon?

07:50.360 --> 07:53.200
-Okay.
-Hey, guys! I found a bunker.

07:54.520 --> 07:58.080
What would you like me to bring up
at the student forum?

07:58.160 --> 08:01.160
Well, I think we should have
free pads and tampons at school.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.120
Mm-hmm. See, that is a great idea.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.880
Could you take a picture of me
with this guy?

08:05.960 --> 08:07.000
Yeah, sure.

08:13.360 --> 08:17.080
Who's Eugene, and what does
he wanna do with your sweet crevice?

08:17.680 --> 08:20.400
He's my boyfriend,
and, um, we've been sexting.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.120
Apparently,
his fantasy is medieval maidens.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.520
-Hm.
-And he calls his dick a sheath.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.840
Yes, and my vagina a lady flower.
Gives me the ick.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.840
But you like fantasy stuff.

08:31.920 --> 08:35.480
I love me some Dungeons and Dragons
when it's a game, not when I'm DTF.

08:35.560 --> 08:38.560
Maybe you should try and get into it.
You might be surprised.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.480
Ola didn't know about alien role-play.
Now she fucking loves it.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.880
Okay. Well, I guess I can try.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.400
I'll help you.
I'm basically an erotica genius.

08:47.440 --> 08:51.080
"Men slept 12 to a bunker
in four-hour shifts."

08:51.160 --> 08:54.320
"Rats bit off chunks
of their flesh while they slept."

08:54.840 --> 08:55.800
Brutal.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.120
"Meat was saved for battles."

08:58.200 --> 09:00.440
"So that meant getting a good meal

09:00.520 --> 09:02.480
meant you might be killed the next day."

09:02.560 --> 09:06.920
It says, "During World War I,
250,000 boys under 18 were recruited."

09:07.440 --> 09:08.640
Same age as us.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.960
Crazy to think
people used to have to go to war.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.160
Some still do. We're just lucky.

09:29.320 --> 09:32.600
What are we supposed to be looking at?
It's basically a fucking junkyard.

09:32.680 --> 09:36.360
Why couldn't we have gone
to the Eiffel Tower? Better for selfies.

09:36.960 --> 09:40.080
I think we're supposed to imagine
what it was like here back then.

09:40.160 --> 09:44.520
-Did you hear something, Olivia?
-Must have been the wind or a war ghost.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.600
-What are you looking at?
-Yeah. Stop it.

09:48.680 --> 09:49.840
She hates you.

09:49.920 --> 09:53.080
Thank you for the support,
but I can deal with this by myself.

09:56.440 --> 09:57.360
Hm?

09:59.120 --> 10:00.880
I do feel awful, Ruby.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.720
I didn't want to hurt you,

10:02.800 --> 10:05.680
and I feel worse
thinking that you hate me.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.400
I don't hate you, Otis.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.200
It'd be so much easier if I did.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.040
I just can't be around you
at the moment, okay?

10:13.600 --> 10:17.440
I… I get it. I'm glad you don't hate me.

10:17.520 --> 10:20.480
All right. Come on, let's go.
Come on!

10:20.560 --> 10:23.320
Is that it?
We've only been here half an hour.

10:24.760 --> 10:26.160
France is so shit.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.880
What's a conscientious objector?

10:29.400 --> 10:32.480
It was when men refused to go to war
because it went against their beliefs.

10:33.000 --> 10:33.960
Wow.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.720
I wanna stand up
for what I believe in more.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.520
-Like you in SRE the other day.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.920
I'd never be brave enough
to do something like that.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.800
You could definitely do that, Aimee.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.840
I, um, hooked up with Isaac the other day.

10:51.920 --> 10:54.040
-What? Get in!

10:54.120 --> 10:56.040
-What was it like?
-It was good.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.560
Yeah. We just get each other.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.000
Think I'm gonna give it
a proper go with him.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.680
You do know Otis and Ruby broke up.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.200
Yeah, I heard.

11:09.960 --> 11:10.840
What about it?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.960
-Oh, I just thought maybe--
-Maybe what?

11:16.480 --> 11:17.600
Well, I…

11:18.600 --> 11:21.880
-I thought you guys might--
-I said I wanna give it a go with Isaac.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.840
What Otis does isn't my business anymore.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.480
Okay. Cool.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.000
I'm so happy for you.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.400
-Thanks, mate.

11:34.080 --> 11:37.080
-Oh, fuck off, Anna.
-What's going on with Anna?

11:37.160 --> 11:39.800
She paid for this trip without asking.
It's pissed me off.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.440
She didn't pay for it. I did.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.360
What do you mean?

11:44.440 --> 11:47.000
You said you couldn't afford it,
so I asked my mum to pay.

11:47.080 --> 11:50.440
-I knew you wouldn't take the money.
-Why did you do that?

11:50.960 --> 11:53.280
It's no big deal. I wanted you to come.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.320
You don't have to pay me back.
Money doesn't matter to me.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.360
It does to me.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.040
We should get on the coach.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.840
"I want to remove your codpiece
and release your beautiful sheath,

12:09.920 --> 12:13.160
then let you make love to me
in a glen full of bluebells

12:13.240 --> 12:16.960
where you will water my hidden peach
with your prince's tongue."

12:17.560 --> 12:20.440
No, I'm not gonna send that.
It's just not me.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.480
Thank you though.
You keep thinking about the student forum.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.640
Some people have no imaginations, I guess.

12:27.480 --> 12:31.360
Lil, I wouldn't mind if we had sex
without the alien stuff sometimes.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.080
I've been meaning to say something.
I didn't know how to.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.600
Why?

12:35.680 --> 12:37.640
I didn't wanna make you feel weird.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.760
No. Why don't you wanna do
the alien stuff? I thought you liked it.

12:40.840 --> 12:44.200
I do sometimes.
Sometimes it's a little bit strange.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.720
-I'm gonna get on the bus.
-Let's go!

12:47.800 --> 12:49.280
-Aw, Lil!
-Let's go!

12:49.360 --> 12:52.280
We're off
to another cemetery, and I am pumped.

12:52.360 --> 12:55.920
I mean, I'm moderately excited,
and I will be monitoring your behavior.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.520
Shit, we're running 15 minutes late!

12:57.600 --> 12:58.960
-Are we?
-Yeah.

12:59.040 --> 13:02.360
Terry, I will give you 20 euros
if you can get us back on schedule.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.360
-Done.
-Great.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.520
Come on, Quentin, for fuck's sake!
What, do you wanna marry France?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.160
Jesus!

13:11.080 --> 13:12.000
Terry!

13:22.640 --> 13:23.760
Seat belt, Colin.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.720
You wanna get Kyle to swap seats?
He can sit with Steve.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.080
No, thanks. I'm fine.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.040
They were too young to die, Maeve.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.920
Some of them were our age.

13:46.000 --> 13:46.960
Mm-hmm.

13:54.560 --> 13:55.600
Okay, Hope.

13:55.680 --> 13:59.920
So, seeing as it's only been six weeks
since your last round of IVF treatment,

14:00.000 --> 14:03.160
I'm going to advise waiting
a little longer before trying again.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.560
I'd rather not wait too long.

14:06.640 --> 14:09.640
Have you thought about other options,
such as adoption?

14:09.720 --> 14:11.480
I've been asked this before.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.760
I've thought about it, and I am not ready
to stop trying to have my own child yet.

14:16.840 --> 14:20.200
Can I ask about how this is affecting
your relationship with your husband?

14:21.280 --> 14:24.000
-Infertility treatments can cause strain--
-We're fine.

14:24.520 --> 14:26.640
He couldn't make it today because of work.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.040
When can I book another round?

14:29.120 --> 14:31.360
I'm not prepared
to offer you another round yet.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.840
I'll have to talk to another doctor, then.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.600
You can see Dr. Ennis
when he's back from holiday next week,

14:40.680 --> 14:42.920
but I think he'll tell you the same thing.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.360
I want a second opinion.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.080
Jean Milburn.

15:43.160 --> 15:47.200
Uh, yes. I'm just waiting for my partner.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.040
Everything looks normal.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.800
You don't wanna know the sex.
Have you changed your mind?

16:20.880 --> 16:21.880
No, thanks.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.400
I'd rather wait.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.560
Many older mothers
make that choice.

16:26.640 --> 16:30.280
They want to focus on
getting through the pregnancy safely.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.520
Now, you are aware
there's a higher chance of miscarriage,

16:33.600 --> 16:35.280
genetic abnormalities, fetal growth--

16:35.360 --> 16:38.800
Yes. I've been reminded of the risks
many times. Thank you.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.400
I didn't go into this lightly.

16:40.480 --> 16:43.400
Yes. Modern science
is allowing women like yourself

16:43.480 --> 16:45.480
to have babies older and older now.

16:46.680 --> 16:49.120
You don't sound as if you approve.

16:49.200 --> 16:53.320
Well, it's easy to forget
that being an elderly parent

16:53.400 --> 16:55.960
can have a negative effect
on your children's lives.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.480
Do you have children, Doctor?

16:58.560 --> 17:00.320
-Uh, yeah, two.
-Hm.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.840
And do you think having
a king-sized arsehole for a father

17:03.920 --> 17:06.160
had a negative impact on their lives too?

17:10.440 --> 17:13.160
I want to talk to your superior.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.560
Is it true you don't wank anymore?

17:32.920 --> 17:34.280
What are you talking about?

17:34.840 --> 17:38.080
Everyone says that Eric broke your heart,
so now you can't wank anymore.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.640
Please stop speaking.

17:44.920 --> 17:47.280
If I don't wank every day,
my balls go blue.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.040
I don't need to know that.

17:50.560 --> 17:51.560
Excuse me.

17:59.520 --> 18:00.720
You going for a wank?

18:04.760 --> 18:06.680
No, I'm not going for a wank.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.000
I don't know why
you're taking it personally.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.600
I'm embarrassed.

18:13.680 --> 18:17.080
I've been dressing up as an alien,
and you've been thinking it's strange.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.120
Not strange strange.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.720
Just sometimes, I wanna be
in the real world when I'm having sex,

18:22.800 --> 18:24.880
not a silly fantasy land.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.360
Oh, so now having sex with me is silly?

18:50.520 --> 18:52.280
Cal.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.680
-Jackson.
-What?

18:57.320 --> 18:59.080
Have you ever noticed how

18:59.760 --> 19:01.280
we're on a trip,

19:02.080 --> 19:03.080
but we're

19:04.400 --> 19:06.640
on a trip?

19:08.320 --> 19:10.760
-Fuck, that's so deep.
-Yeah.

19:17.720 --> 19:18.880
Cal?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.880
-Do you see that?
-Yeah.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.600
Should we go?
We should. Let's go.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.720
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.560
All right, let's go.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.920
You'll always be head boy, Marchetti.

19:44.640 --> 19:45.800
What the fuck?

19:56.200 --> 19:59.040
This door leads to another portal.

20:08.000 --> 20:08.840
A minute.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.680
-Wait a minute!

20:12.760 --> 20:14.480
One minute, please.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.400
Oh fuck!

20:17.480 --> 20:20.200
No, no, no, no, no!

20:20.280 --> 20:21.200
Let us in!

20:21.280 --> 20:23.520
-Set us free!
-Wait a fucking minute!

20:23.600 --> 20:25.400
-Ah!

20:30.200 --> 20:31.040
Come on!

20:38.680 --> 20:39.680
It's cool.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.120
What are you doing in there?

21:06.520 --> 21:07.360
Hey.

21:35.000 --> 21:35.960
Oh my God!

21:55.720 --> 21:56.560
Sir!

21:56.640 --> 21:58.440
Terry, get a grip on her!

22:08.000 --> 22:10.440
Is everyone okay? What the hell happened?

22:10.520 --> 22:11.880
Something hit that car.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.800
I think It was a bat!
I hope it's not dead.

22:17.280 --> 22:21.840
A doctor should not be putting
his opinions about my pregnancy on me.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.280
-It's completely inappropriate.
-Oy vey.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.880
It's patriarchy in action, in fact.

22:26.960 --> 22:30.120
Dissecting a woman's choices
in the cruelest manner.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.560
-And in a hospital!
-Hey, what's happening?

22:32.640 --> 22:35.920
I just had the most horrible experience
with a doctor,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.400
and I am making a formal complaint.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.280
Sorry. We are upset.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.880
No, we are not upset.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.800
I am upset.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.720
And my anger is appropriate.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.080
-Can you help us? Thank you.
-Let me call my supervisor.

22:50.160 --> 22:54.320
Oh! Ha! That is fantastic.
Yes, ignore the pregnant woman,

22:54.400 --> 22:57.160
and listen to the straight white man,
for fuck's sakes.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.200
Jean, calm down.

22:58.280 --> 23:02.680
Don't you tell me
to calm down, Jakob. Where were you?

23:02.760 --> 23:05.040
I told you,
I was trying to get us some tea.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.080
Well, fuck the fucking tea.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.320
I needed you in the room.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.640
How can I help you?

23:10.720 --> 23:13.200
Oh, that's fantastic. Another one.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.200
I don't think that was a bat.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.960
-It's a poo!
-It's human poo.

23:26.040 --> 23:27.600
I think I'm gonna vomit.

23:27.680 --> 23:30.720
One of your students
threw poo at my car!

23:30.800 --> 23:33.040
Yes. Okay.

23:33.920 --> 23:36.600
Anyone know what he's saying?
Who speaks French properly?

23:36.680 --> 23:38.320
Rahim, please.

23:40.320 --> 23:43.320
Um, he says, "At least no one was hurt."

23:43.400 --> 23:44.640
Yes.

23:44.720 --> 23:47.240
I saw an arm throw it out of the window.

23:48.440 --> 23:51.440
And he says that
we should carry on driving now.

23:52.680 --> 23:57.120
It was him.
It was him! He has no sock!

23:57.200 --> 23:59.520
It was him who threw the poo at my car!

24:00.960 --> 24:04.560
He thinks he knows me.
I don't know you, sir. I'm sorry.

24:04.640 --> 24:07.480
No, you wouldn't know us.
We're from Moordale, England.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.360
I think someone threw it from our coach.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.520
The toilet's blocked,
and the window's open.

24:14.560 --> 24:15.560
Oh my God!

24:16.080 --> 24:19.600
Did someone throw this poo
from that coach?

24:19.680 --> 24:21.840
-What if it was me?
-Huh?

24:21.920 --> 24:24.000
-It's not you, Jackson.
-I poo all the time.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.320
-Someone own up, please.
-I'm just a tube.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.160
Did they put it in a sock?

24:28.240 --> 24:29.320
Don't touch it.

24:29.400 --> 24:32.320
It could be evidence.
Jesus Christ. Oh my God!

24:32.400 --> 24:35.040
-Oh good. Hope's calling me. Hope.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.360
Ignore it, Colin.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.560
Jesus Christ.
Do you guys think this is funny?

24:41.120 --> 24:42.240
Do you?

24:42.320 --> 24:47.000
Do you have any idea the kind of pressure
Miss Sands and I are under?

24:47.080 --> 24:52.080
Someone is gonna take responsibility
for this flying feces!

24:52.720 --> 24:54.360
Anyone? No?

24:54.440 --> 24:58.400
Okay. I didn't wanna have to do this,
but, boys, trousers up.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.600
We're checking socks, mate. Trousers up!

25:01.280 --> 25:03.360
Steve. Other one.

25:04.720 --> 25:05.640
Great.

25:06.160 --> 25:07.440
-Milburn.
-Really?

25:07.520 --> 25:08.440
Yes!

25:09.560 --> 25:11.040
Socks. Good.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.800
Excellent.
Thank you. Not yours, mate.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.840
Jackson. Good. Excellent.

25:18.920 --> 25:19.920
Come on.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.440
-Good.
-It was my poo, sir.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.280
-I panicked and--
-It's my poo.

25:27.640 --> 25:30.800
-I blocked the toilet. I was embarrassed--
-I also poo sometimes.

25:30.880 --> 25:33.600
Oh God, don't we all?
What is this, Spartacus?

25:33.680 --> 25:36.640
Maybe it was my poo.
Maybe it's Miss Sands' poo.

25:36.720 --> 25:38.160
-What?
-She's more than capable.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.840
We don't have time for that now.

25:39.920 --> 25:42.360
Adam, clean this up.
I don't care how. Okay?

25:45.320 --> 25:47.160
Thank you, Adam Groff,

25:47.960 --> 25:51.800
for owning up to doing this huge poo

25:51.880 --> 25:53.240
and undermining my authority.

25:53.320 --> 25:55.680
Thank you. Cheers, buddy.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.680
Cheers, mate. No. No.

25:59.240 --> 26:02.200
-No. Fuck him. Fuck him.
-Okay, let's all relax. Yeah?

26:02.280 --> 26:05.120
If anyone needs to use the toilets,
they're over here.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.640
Be back here in 15 minutes.

26:07.720 --> 26:08.680
Thank you.

26:27.240 --> 26:30.000
Everyone thinks
I'm an idiot anyway. I wanna go home.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.280
I thought you hated me.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.200
No.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.040
I don't hate you.

26:35.640 --> 26:38.000
But I'm not touching your poo, mate. So…

26:55.800 --> 26:57.680
Oh, what manner of beast!

27:05.640 --> 27:07.640
-When I decided to be a teacher…
-Mm-hmm.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.240
…I dreamt of helping students
fulfill their potential

27:10.320 --> 27:12.720
by gently drawing out
their inner creative gifts.

27:15.160 --> 27:16.840
Instead, I'm plunging their shit.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.120
You are majestic.

27:28.880 --> 27:29.800
Maeve.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.720
Can we talk?

27:31.800 --> 27:33.080
Not right now, Aimee.

27:33.640 --> 27:36.720
Why are you acting like this?
I wanted to pay.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.080
You don't get it.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.480
What is it that I don't get?

27:41.200 --> 27:43.240
We live in completely different worlds.

27:44.480 --> 27:45.800
I'm not rich like you.

27:46.840 --> 27:49.600
I can't decide to be a baker
just 'cause I like toast.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.840
That's a fucking mean thing to say.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.920
Yeah, well, sorry, but it's true.

27:57.960 --> 28:00.480
I wanted to do something nice. That's all.

28:01.040 --> 28:04.120
You never accept help from anyone, ever,
'cause you're too proud.

28:04.200 --> 28:05.600
I wanted to do a nice thing.

28:05.680 --> 28:09.920
-I don't need nice things.
-Because you're above it all and strong?

28:10.440 --> 28:13.720
You act like you don't give a shit
about anyone. It's to keep people out.

28:13.800 --> 28:15.960
You've done it to Otis,
and you're doing it to me!

28:16.040 --> 28:17.840
-I don't keep everyone out.
-You do.

28:17.920 --> 28:18.760
No, I don't.

28:18.840 --> 28:22.000
You're probably gonna do the same to Isaac
and end up hurting everyone.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.760
You're one to talk.
Look how you treat Steve.

28:30.800 --> 28:33.400
You act like he's got the plague
every time he's around you.

28:33.480 --> 28:34.480
He's so confused

28:35.240 --> 28:37.800
because you're too much
of a people pleaser to break up with him!

28:39.200 --> 28:40.720
You talked about being brave.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.720
That would be brave.

28:43.440 --> 28:44.840
I'll pay you back somehow.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.360
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.080
Have you replied to Eugene?

28:56.160 --> 28:59.560
No. It's… it's too awkward.
I think I'm just gonna break up with him.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.480
My mum always used to say,

29:01.560 --> 29:04.600
"If you love someone,
it's better to bend a bit than break."

29:04.680 --> 29:06.720
That's if you really like them, obviously.

29:06.800 --> 29:10.280
It must be hard not having her around.
She sounds really smart.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.120
Yeah, she was.

29:12.760 --> 29:16.040
It's a little bit confusing at the moment
because my dad's having a new baby,

29:16.120 --> 29:19.680
and Lilly doesn't really seem
to understand why it's difficult.

29:20.200 --> 29:23.280
My aunt died last year,
and I thought the sadness would pass,

29:23.360 --> 29:26.480
but it never really goes away,
only gets smaller.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.000
Maybe Lily's never experienced that.

29:31.200 --> 29:34.880
Why don't you try telling Eugene
what you'd like him to sext you instead?

29:34.960 --> 29:36.480
Let's go! What's that?

29:36.560 --> 29:38.160
-Really?
-It might work.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.680
CLOSED

29:50.680 --> 29:52.360
Right. Good. Okay!

29:52.440 --> 29:55.080
Now that we're all a little bit calmer,

29:55.160 --> 29:57.200
should we have a sing-along? Yeah?

29:57.280 --> 29:58.120
Let's do it.

30:14.600 --> 30:15.520
You all right?

30:16.640 --> 30:18.880
Aimee and I
just had our first fight.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.360
This trip is the worst.

30:22.440 --> 30:24.360
Can't get much worse than a rogue poo.

30:29.800 --> 30:30.680
Where's the coach?

30:34.200 --> 30:37.440
-Have you got your phone?
-No. I left all my stuff on the coach.

30:37.520 --> 30:38.440
Me too.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.000
Okay. It just got a lot worse.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.640
Jean, haven't seen you for a while.

30:49.720 --> 30:52.920
Why'd you stop calling me?
Holy fucking shit! Wow!

30:53.000 --> 30:55.480
That's… You're…

30:55.560 --> 30:59.440
I didn't think you could…
that, like, older women could--

30:59.520 --> 31:02.720
-Just say congratulations, Dan.
-Congratulations! Congratulations.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.400
Shit. It's not mine, is it?

31:04.480 --> 31:06.120
No, it's mine, actually.

31:06.760 --> 31:09.800
Oh, that's great, dude.
That's great. Well done.

31:09.880 --> 31:10.800
Phew!

31:12.160 --> 31:14.200
We need to go, actually. Goodbye.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.840
Right, yeah.
No, I've gotta go see the doctor myself.

31:16.920 --> 31:19.360
I've got a weird chafing thing
going on with my ball sack.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.840
I think it's my motorbike,
but it's really…

31:22.680 --> 31:24.160
You didn't need to know that. Okay.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.000
Congratulations!

31:29.200 --> 31:31.280
You used to sleep with this man?

31:31.360 --> 31:33.080
He's so much younger than you.

31:33.160 --> 31:37.240
I used to sleep with a lot of men.
And some of them were younger than me.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.400
This makes me think.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.720
What does it make you think?

31:46.840 --> 31:48.680
Is the baby even mine?

31:48.760 --> 31:50.480
-What?
-He seemed to think it was his.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.960
-Don't be ridiculous. He--
-Well, he did.

31:55.400 --> 31:58.240
I found this at home.

32:00.160 --> 32:01.400
What?

32:01.960 --> 32:03.520
That could be anyone's.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.000
It's probably Remy's from years ago.

32:06.080 --> 32:07.840
Why didn't you talk to me about it?

32:08.440 --> 32:11.960
Because you're pregnant,
and I didn't wanna cause any stress.

32:12.040 --> 32:14.720
But then I see this motorcycle man,

32:14.800 --> 32:17.840
and you seem
to have contacted him quite recently.

32:17.920 --> 32:22.640
And then I remember
you've been kissing your ex-husband and--

32:22.720 --> 32:26.480
-Jakob!
-It just makes me think, okay?

32:26.560 --> 32:30.080
Look, I have had
a lot of casual sex in my life.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.880
I can't change that.
In fact, I wouldn't want to.

32:34.400 --> 32:38.680
But if you don't trust me,
then this just isn't going to work.

32:43.800 --> 32:45.000
I don't trust you.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.160
I can't believe this is happening.

32:54.520 --> 32:56.760
-How about a paternity test?

33:01.360 --> 33:03.840
Yeah. Yeah.

33:05.120 --> 33:06.040
Okay.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.040
If that's what you want.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.280
And what do we do in the meantime?

33:16.000 --> 33:17.600
Are we still even together?

33:21.200 --> 33:22.200
I don't know.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.320
Okay, party people.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.760
-This is for real.

33:31.280 --> 33:34.560
Who remembers this? Anyone? Here we go.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.040
Ready? Whoa.

33:39.400 --> 33:40.320
Come on!

33:43.160 --> 33:44.200
No?

33:59.520 --> 34:01.760
I'm sorry I made you feel embarrassed.

34:01.840 --> 34:05.280
I don't think the alien stuff is silly,
but it's not real.

34:05.360 --> 34:08.280
I'd like to be a bit more grounded
and in the moment with you.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.760
Aliens are definitely real.

34:13.320 --> 34:16.840
There are potentially endless galaxies
and planets and universes out there,

34:16.920 --> 34:19.400
and you actually think
we're the only life that exists?

34:19.480 --> 34:23.200
I think it's better to focus
on the life that we have on Earth.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.600
I can't believe
you don't think aliens are real.

34:27.680 --> 34:29.200
I can't believe you do.

34:34.680 --> 34:35.840
It's getting dark.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.120
It's gonna be cold once it's dark.

34:39.320 --> 34:41.760
I only got a B in French,
so if we find someone to help,

34:41.840 --> 34:45.080
how do we know they're actually
a kind stranger and not some psychopath?

34:47.280 --> 34:48.560
What are we gonna eat?

34:49.600 --> 34:51.240
I'm hungry all the time!

34:52.720 --> 34:54.720
I'm panicking. Are you panicking?

34:54.800 --> 34:56.960
No. We're not gonna starve to death.

34:57.040 --> 35:00.320
I don't think you're taking this
seriously enough. We could die.

35:00.400 --> 35:01.480
We're not gonna die.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.400
Someone will drive past.
We can use their phone.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.320
It's gonna be fine.

35:04.400 --> 35:07.360
We should hitchhike
or just walk to a nearby town.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.040
I think we should stay here.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.720
Okay, this is bad.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.080
This is very bad.

35:16.960 --> 35:20.280
Okay.
How… how do you say "help" in French?

35:20.360 --> 35:21.600
How do I say "help"?

35:24.040 --> 35:25.200
Help!

35:25.280 --> 35:26.960
I am help!

35:29.600 --> 35:31.040
Why are you laughing?

35:31.120 --> 35:34.800
-Sorry. You're funny when you're stressed.
-Well, you're not helping.

35:38.280 --> 35:39.720
I am help!

35:48.440 --> 35:49.680
Something you wanna say?

35:52.320 --> 35:53.680
I think poetry's dumb.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.240
Why?

35:56.120 --> 35:59.400
It's just long words
that don't make any sense.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.240
Maybe you're not listening.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.080
I have written a poem about you.

36:21.840 --> 36:25.200
"I shed blood over what?"

36:26.560 --> 36:30.560
-You fell over-- Right.
-"A rectangle man so unremarkable."

36:30.640 --> 36:31.680
"A boring horse."

36:31.760 --> 36:34.600
"Its blah-blah eyes never open,
never closed."

36:35.280 --> 36:36.520
"His head shape so average."

36:39.440 --> 36:41.080
That's actually quite good.

36:43.480 --> 36:44.880
I think I was wrong though.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.360
You're not as unremarkable as I thought.

37:14.040 --> 37:15.520
Hm. Mm-hmm.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.680
Even if you don't do the forum,

37:25.560 --> 37:28.600
maybe you should still talk to Hope
about the changing room thing.

37:30.440 --> 37:31.480
I don't like Hope,

37:32.440 --> 37:35.280
but it's important to you,
so I think we should make her listen.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.840
What do you think?

37:39.800 --> 37:42.000
-Okay, well, I think…

37:44.080 --> 37:45.640
we can make things better.

37:49.320 --> 37:51.320
I didn't think I cared about things,

37:52.120 --> 37:53.240
but I do.

37:56.160 --> 37:57.200
Hm.

38:00.560 --> 38:02.280
You made me realize that I do.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.240
Okay.

38:09.960 --> 38:11.440
-We'll make her listen.
-Yes!

38:25.640 --> 38:27.160
You are beautiful.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.160
Um, I'm sorry, Jackson. I don't…

38:55.040 --> 38:56.280
I don't think I can do this.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.600
-Okay. No, that's cool.
-Sorry.

39:19.360 --> 39:20.720
Can you pass this to Maeve?

39:23.680 --> 39:24.640
Babe,

39:26.320 --> 39:28.120
are you not attracted to me anymore?

39:28.200 --> 39:29.400
I won't be upset.

39:30.480 --> 39:33.880
Of course I'll be upset. I just need
to know if you wanna be with me.

39:34.520 --> 39:36.200
Course I wanna be with you.

39:39.200 --> 39:40.120
Maeve's not here.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.880
Maeve? Maeve?

39:46.840 --> 39:47.920
Where's Maeve?

39:48.760 --> 39:50.080
She's definitely not here.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.640
Maeve Wiley's not on the coach.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.720
That can't be right.
I did a head count. Maeve?

39:56.800 --> 39:59.400
-Maeve? Maeve?
-Maeve! Maeve!

39:59.480 --> 40:00.560
Who is Maeve?

40:01.080 --> 40:02.280
Who are you?

40:02.360 --> 40:03.520
I'm Albert.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.360
-Oh…
-Colin Ray Hendricks.

40:06.440 --> 40:08.920
Terry, turn the coach around! Maeve?

40:21.000 --> 40:22.520
Why did you and Ruby break up?

40:24.480 --> 40:25.440
Um,

40:26.560 --> 40:28.880
I didn't like her as much as she liked me.

40:30.280 --> 40:32.280
-It's true. I know.

40:34.160 --> 40:37.600
What about you?
How's it going with that Isaac guy?

40:38.280 --> 40:39.800
"That Isaac guy."

40:41.320 --> 40:42.880
Yeah, things are good.

40:43.920 --> 40:44.920
I like him.

40:46.280 --> 40:47.280
Hm.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.520
I know you left me a voice mail.

41:01.480 --> 41:03.600
Can we not, uh, talk about that?

41:03.680 --> 41:06.920
It's embarrassing enough
you've ignored me for months.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.160
Or pretend it didn't happen.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.440
I never got it.

41:14.160 --> 41:15.320
Isaac deleted it.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.320
What do you mean, "deleted"?

41:19.840 --> 41:22.400
He was trying to protect me, apparently.

41:23.200 --> 41:24.600
He fucked up. It's a whole thing.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.360
So you… you never heard it?

41:29.400 --> 41:30.360
Nope.

41:38.320 --> 41:39.560
How long have you known?

41:40.200 --> 41:41.600
I don't know. Couple weeks.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.120
And you didn't say anything?

41:45.360 --> 41:46.480
No.

41:47.920 --> 41:50.360
You acted like a complete dick
to me last term.

41:51.640 --> 41:54.840
You don't get let off the hook
'cause you call up once and say I'm sorry.

41:54.920 --> 41:57.680
That's exactly how apologies work, Maeve.

41:59.960 --> 42:01.520
He shouldn't have deleted it.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.480
No, he shouldn't have.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.280
But he did, and here we are.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.320
What did it say?

42:15.680 --> 42:16.720
The voice mail?

42:18.440 --> 42:19.440
Doesn't matter.

42:20.080 --> 42:21.360
It was ages ago.

42:22.640 --> 42:23.760
Matters to me.

42:35.040 --> 42:36.360
It was something like,

42:38.520 --> 42:39.520
"Hi, Maeve."

42:43.360 --> 42:45.280
"I'm watching you on TV right now."

42:48.080 --> 42:51.800
"And I wanted to let you know
how proud I am of you."

42:56.240 --> 42:59.920
"And about how you saying you had feelings
for me was all I ever wanted to hear."

43:01.520 --> 43:03.040
"'Cause it's always been you."

43:06.120 --> 43:07.120
"I love you."

43:09.600 --> 43:11.720
Anyway, it was stupid.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.000
Did you mean it?

43:35.720 --> 43:36.800
Did you mean it?

43:39.600 --> 43:41.000
Of course I meant it.

43:57.760 --> 43:59.560
I can't… I can't do this.

43:59.640 --> 44:00.560
Okay.

44:01.240 --> 44:02.280
I understand.

44:11.600 --> 44:14.000
I don't… I don't wanna lose you again.

44:15.880 --> 44:17.960
I'm confused. This is confusing me.

44:35.520 --> 44:36.640
Ruby, don't look.

44:44.200 --> 44:45.200
Ah!

44:45.280 --> 44:49.400
Milburn. You're here too.
We had no idea you were missing.

44:50.320 --> 44:51.200
So sorry.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.960
Come on, guys, on the coach. On the coach!

44:56.520 --> 44:58.440
-Oh my…

44:58.520 --> 45:00.240
-Woo-hoo!

45:00.320 --> 45:02.520
We're the worst teachers.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.240
-But we are good in a crisis.
-Yeah.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.520
And we make the most incredible team.

45:06.600 --> 45:07.840
Don't you think?

45:13.200 --> 45:14.160
What are you doing?

45:15.360 --> 45:18.680
Emily Swati Sands…

45:20.480 --> 45:21.600
will you marry me?

45:22.680 --> 45:24.920
Of course not.
We've been dating less than a year.

45:26.280 --> 45:27.160
But…

45:28.960 --> 45:32.760
I have been thinking
that maybe we could move in together.

45:32.840 --> 45:33.680
Really?

45:33.760 --> 45:34.720
Yeah.

45:36.360 --> 45:37.800
But where will Michael live?

45:39.000 --> 45:40.920
He's a grown man. He'll be fine.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.640
Yes! Yes! Yes!

45:46.200 --> 45:47.680
Save your applause.

45:47.760 --> 45:50.640
We are not getting married,
but we are moving in together!

45:52.240 --> 45:54.240
Can we please go home?

46:03.960 --> 46:06.600
Uh, miss, I'm ready for my presentation.

46:06.680 --> 46:10.240
Oh, we're not doing that
till we get back to school, Kyle.

46:11.320 --> 46:14.200
All right, listen up, everyone.
I've had an epiphany on this trip.

46:16.800 --> 46:18.040
We're all gonna die.

46:18.120 --> 46:20.600
-Kyle, sit down.
-Life is so short.

46:21.520 --> 46:24.120
We might not be dead yet,
like those poor, young soldiers,

46:24.200 --> 46:25.400
but one day we will be.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.160
So, my point is…

46:29.800 --> 46:33.040
Where'd he get that?
That's a soldier's hat. Stolen property!

46:33.120 --> 46:34.200
Oh.

46:34.280 --> 46:37.560
I've forgotten what my point is,
but how cool is my hat?

46:37.640 --> 46:38.880
It's not cool, Kyle.

46:40.440 --> 46:42.080
Oh yeah. Um…

46:43.240 --> 46:46.600
My… my point is that we should try
and live in the moment

46:47.440 --> 46:48.800
because we don't have long.

46:49.320 --> 46:50.200
So,

46:51.000 --> 46:54.520
if you love someone,
you should tell 'em that you love 'em.

46:54.600 --> 46:55.760
Tell 'em now.

46:57.360 --> 46:58.840
Because it might be too late.

47:00.600 --> 47:01.560
Life is

47:02.880 --> 47:03.760
fragile.

47:06.440 --> 47:08.800
So, in the spirit of spreading the love,

47:08.880 --> 47:10.560
I got a little gift for everyone.

47:10.640 --> 47:12.560
These are called magic mushrooms.

47:12.640 --> 47:14.480
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-So--

47:14.560 --> 47:15.720
Kyle, sit down!

47:15.800 --> 47:16.920
Sit down, Kyle.

47:18.160 --> 47:21.080
You have to spoil it.
You were doing so well, Kyle.

47:21.160 --> 47:23.280
Let's just forget that happened,
all right?

47:23.360 --> 47:26.400
I know this trip
has been hard for some of you.

47:27.440 --> 47:31.200
But we're only half an hour away
from the White Cliffs of Dover.

47:31.720 --> 47:33.160
So, let's fix up,

47:34.120 --> 47:35.880
tidy up our uniforms,

47:37.320 --> 47:39.240
and get our general shit together.

47:39.960 --> 47:40.800
Yeah?

47:42.400 --> 47:43.320
Cheers.

47:43.880 --> 47:45.000
Lights, please, Terry.

48:11.960 --> 48:12.880
Fucking love you.

48:13.960 --> 48:14.920
Baba ghanoush.

48:57.840 --> 48:59.840
Hey, hey, hey! Come on.

49:04.280 --> 49:06.520
-Hey, do you want a lift?
-Uh, no, thanks.

49:07.320 --> 49:08.640
Please don't tell.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.880
Maeve? Maeve.

49:10.960 --> 49:11.960
Yeah?

49:13.120 --> 49:15.160
We should talk about what happened.

49:16.080 --> 49:18.400
Is it okay if we don't tonight?

49:19.520 --> 49:20.920
I need to sort my head out.

49:22.760 --> 49:23.600
That's okay.

49:28.600 --> 49:30.320
-Hm.

49:36.160 --> 49:37.120
Cal.

49:38.320 --> 49:39.280
Are we okay?

49:39.880 --> 49:42.920
Yeah, yeah. We're totally fine.
I'll see you on Monday.

49:49.920 --> 49:50.760
How'd it go?

49:52.440 --> 49:57.280
It was… 100% peachy. Yeah.

50:32.800 --> 50:36.040
Oh, Grandma! Grandma!

50:36.120 --> 50:37.040
Come on.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.760
Eric! Eric!

50:38.840 --> 50:41.600
-Hey, Auntie! Auntie!
-Eric!
