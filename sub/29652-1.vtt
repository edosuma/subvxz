the right amount this time!

02:43.197 --> 02:45.164

02:45.166 --> 02:46.298
Tea'll be ready soon.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.636

03:21.936 --> 03:23.335
- I want to eat
me dinner outside.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.404
It's a lovely day.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.507
- It's a bit cold
outside, isn't it?

03:28.509 --> 03:32.110
- I wanna spend it near
me vegetable patch.

03:34.148 --> 03:35.113
- All right, then.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.618
- Thank you.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.756

Well, pumpkins, you've been fed,

04:27.134 --> 04:28.033
Mmm.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.870
(soft mumbling)

04:32.940 --> 04:34.306
I love ya, yeah.

04:35.809 --> 04:38.377
Before, we've got competition.

04:40.347 --> 04:43.248
That's all of ya,
every one of ya.

04:44.318 --> 04:47.152
We should have a
good time together.

04:49.390 --> 04:53.191
I'm having a good dinner,

05:27.161 --> 05:28.560

(sniffles)

06:03.597 --> 06:05.664
(spits)

06:07.368 --> 06:10.635
- You know, I fuckin' hate
people like that, land owners.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.138
I mean, just look at him!

06:14.975 --> 06:16.375
Who does he think he is?

06:16.377 --> 06:18.543
Talking to people like
us like we're scum.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.080
- I fuckin' hate that
stupid pumpkin patch.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.182
He's obsessed with it.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.486
I bet he shags 'em
and everything.

06:31.425 --> 06:34.226
- Did I tell you he threatened
to stab me the other day?

06:34.228 --> 06:35.627
Yeah.

06:35.629 --> 06:38.130
All because I threw a
fuckin' stick over his fence.

06:38.132 --> 06:40.465
Said "We need to teach
you a bit of respect."

06:41.802 --> 06:44.469
- He's the one who needs to
learn a bit of fuckin' respect.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.772
Yeah, I reckon we
should teach him.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.370
Just ignore them.

08:25.372 --> 08:28.607
- They're forever
taunting me, Shelly.

all right, Danny?

08:53.634 --> 08:55.934
(heavy breathing)

08:57.938 --> 08:59.521
- Come on.

08:59.522 --> 09:01.105
We'll get him when
he least expects it.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.313

11:24.217 --> 11:25.116
Uncle?

12:43.196 --> 12:45.430
What have you done
with my uncle?

12:45.431 --> 12:47.665
- What in the fuck are you
talking about, you silly slag?

Stop now, you bastard.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.013
Stop it.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.247
- You're not getting
away from me, sexy minx.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.082
- This is supposed to be
a romantic night away,

15:18.084 --> 15:19.684
stop teasing me.

15:19.686 --> 15:20.685
- But it's so much fun, come on.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.640
You're no annoying.

17:55.642 --> 17:56.908
- It's these beers.

- Right.

21:14.707 --> 21:17.675
Remember to look out for
your missing team member.

21:17.677 --> 21:21.145
The deal was to meet at the
first checkpoint by midday,

21:21.147 --> 21:23.080
so if you're not there, you
have to make your own way

21:23.082 --> 21:24.282
to base camp.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.023
We'll pick everybody up.

21:32.025 --> 21:34.692
We'll send a search party
before dark, don't worry.

23:00.513 --> 23:01.712
- All right, people.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.381
Quick rundown.

23:03.383 --> 23:04.348
Get out your maps.

23:06.252 --> 23:07.718
(synth rock music)

23:07.720 --> 23:08.586
- Oh.

23:08.588 --> 23:09.787
Must be setting up camp.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.489
Check this out,
I've got this down.

23:14.026 --> 23:14.925
- Right.

23:25.037 --> 23:27.938
(soft chattering)

23:31.944 --> 23:33.210
(birds chirping)

23:33.212 --> 23:34.612
- Thanks.

23:34.614 --> 23:37.081
So we just walked up there...

23:40.319 --> 23:42.820
(birds chirping)

23:42.822 --> 23:45.222
(unzipping)

23:56.035 --> 23:57.234
To that point.

24:03.376 --> 24:06.177
(birds chirping)

24:13.352 --> 24:15.753
(soft chattering)

24:15.755 --> 24:17.421
- Hey, Alex?

24:17.423 --> 24:18.856
What are you doing?

24:18.858 --> 24:19.790
- What?

24:19.792 --> 24:21.692
- [Lance] What are you doing?

24:21.694 --> 24:23.427
- I was just setting my tent up.

24:23.429 --> 24:25.896
Well, I was gonna
have a cup of tea.

24:25.898 --> 24:26.797
- But why?

24:27.800 --> 24:29.133
This is private land.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.034
- What?

24:31.103 --> 24:33.204
- He set up that tent quickly.

24:33.206 --> 24:36.207
- It's a pop up, cocky bastard.

24:36.209 --> 24:37.908
- Come on, put everything away.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.143
We are heading to base camp.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.945
- Oh bloody, I've
just set it all up,

24:40.947 --> 24:42.646
it's gonna take me ages, man.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.051
(hits)

24:49.589 --> 24:52.423
(birds chirping)

25:00.233 --> 25:02.967
(water flowing)

25:25.992 --> 25:29.226
(underbrush crunches)

25:30.429 --> 25:33.163
(water flowing)

25:35.134 --> 25:38.369
(underbrush crunches)

25:39.639 --> 25:42.373
(water flowing)

25:51.951 --> 25:54.752
(birds chirping)

26:00.259 --> 26:01.091
(dramatic music)

26:01.093 --> 26:01.992
- Hey.

26:03.429 --> 26:06.230
(dramatic music)

26:08.501 --> 26:10.234
You all right there?

26:11.070 --> 26:13.904
(dramatic music)

26:15.341 --> 26:17.408
(gasps)

26:18.411 --> 26:20.377
(gags)

26:21.314 --> 26:24.214
(heavy breathing)

26:27.620 --> 26:30.421
(dramatic music)

26:33.926 --> 26:36.093
(grunts)

26:38.397 --> 26:40.564
(groans)

26:41.834 --> 26:43.400
(wincing)

26:43.402 --> 26:44.935
Oh, fuck.

26:44.937 --> 26:45.836
Oh shit.

26:47.707 --> 26:50.541
(dramatic music)

26:52.278 --> 26:53.344
Oh, fuck.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.980
(gasps)
Fuck.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.915
- What the fuck are
you doing on my land?

26:57.917 --> 26:59.283
This is private property.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.453
I'm sick of you
people trespassing.

27:03.889 --> 27:07.858
You need to get your
ass out of here.

27:07.860 --> 27:10.260
(dramatic music)

27:10.262 --> 27:11.428
- [Sam] Fuck.

27:12.498 --> 27:15.332
(dramatic music)

27:54.974 --> 28:00.010
(water flowing)
(birds chirping)

28:13.259 --> 28:14.258
- Oh, what do you know.

28:14.260 --> 28:15.359
We've lost another camper.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.094
Where the hell is Alex?

28:18.030 --> 28:19.630
- That Alex is a bit odd.

28:19.632 --> 28:21.632
Why is he even here?

28:21.634 --> 28:23.901
- I don't care, as
long as he's paying.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.969
- Ah, I like the way you think.

28:27.573 --> 28:28.839
- Right then.

28:28.841 --> 28:31.642
As you can see, we've
arrived at base camp,

28:31.644 --> 28:34.244
and it's nice to see that
at least some of you have

28:34.246 --> 28:35.913
managed to keep up.

28:35.915 --> 28:38.082
This is where you'll
be eating, sleeping,

28:38.084 --> 28:40.984
and shitting for the
next few days, so,

28:40.986 --> 28:42.386
get used to it.

28:42.388 --> 28:45.823
- That's right, eating,
sleeping, and shitting.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.826
- I think it's about
time for dinner, so,

28:48.828 --> 28:53.163
you need to get together
as a group, make camp fire,

28:53.165 --> 28:55.466
and your rations
are in your bags.

28:58.037 --> 29:00.704
(water flowing)

29:07.747 --> 29:10.147
(unzipping)

29:12.651 --> 29:13.717
- Oh, sweet.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.857
- Corn beef hash.

29:21.026 --> 29:22.526
What's yours?

29:22.528 --> 29:23.427
- Rice pudding.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.296
(both groan)

29:26.298 --> 29:27.464
- Now, now ladies.

29:28.534 --> 29:29.933
That stuff puts
hair on your chest,

29:29.935 --> 29:31.668
and will make you
big and strong.

29:35.708 --> 29:37.274
- Oh, son.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.710
Bangers and mash.

29:39.712 --> 29:40.611
What you got?

29:42.815 --> 29:43.680
Oh, no way.

29:43.682 --> 29:44.648
Corn beef hash.

29:46.051 --> 29:47.217
I love that stuff.

29:50.055 --> 29:50.988
(groans)

29:50.990 --> 29:52.890
One jealous camper right here.

29:57.229 --> 30:02.299
(water flowing)
(wind blowing)

30:08.174 --> 30:09.072
Where's Alex?

30:11.477 --> 30:16.547
(water flowing)
(wind blowing)

30:21.387 --> 30:24.188
(birds chirping)

30:27.493 --> 30:28.392
- Fuck!

30:29.995 --> 30:33.063
Why won't you go back to the
same fucking place you were in?

30:34.366 --> 30:35.899
What fucking use are you, man?

30:37.236 --> 30:38.735
(birds chirping)

30:38.737 --> 30:40.270
I don't know even know
why I bought you for this

30:40.272 --> 30:42.172
fucking expedition, I didn't
even wanna come here, man.

30:44.043 --> 30:49.079
(underbrush crunching)
(birds chirping)

30:50.482 --> 30:52.149
I bought you and even if
I wanted to sleep in you,

30:52.151 --> 30:53.283
my legs would be
hanging out anyway,

30:53.285 --> 30:55.652
'cause you're fucking pointless.

30:57.990 --> 31:00.290
(birds chirping)

31:00.292 --> 31:02.025
Yeah, you can pop out quickly.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.527
What fucking use is that?

31:05.264 --> 31:08.098
(birds chirping)

31:11.737 --> 31:16.306
Fuck this thing.
(twig cracks)

31:16.308 --> 31:19.109
(birds chirping)

31:48.440 --> 31:49.640
Fuck you then!

31:51.644 --> 31:52.876
You know what?

31:52.878 --> 31:55.245
I'm just gonna
drop you in there.

31:56.515 --> 31:59.483
And you can go the
fuck over there.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.252
(cracking)

32:02.254 --> 32:05.055
(dramatic music)

32:13.565 --> 32:14.464
Hey, mate?

32:15.501 --> 32:16.733
You all right?

32:18.771 --> 32:21.605
(dramatic music)

32:23.842 --> 32:24.741
Mate?

32:26.245 --> 32:30.747
It's a bit weird that you're
lingering behind a tree.

32:31.517 --> 32:34.351
(dramatic music)

32:50.269 --> 32:52.703
(head thuds)

32:53.605 --> 32:56.373
(dramatic music)

33:14.293 --> 33:17.094
(birds chirping)

33:32.778 --> 33:35.779
(wood cracks)

33:35.781 --> 33:38.582
(dramatic music)

33:40.019 --> 33:42.252
(shucking)
(Alex yells)

33:42.254 --> 33:44.588
(cracking)

33:44.590 --> 33:47.157
(Alex groans)

33:50.763 --> 33:51.661
- Slowly.

33:58.303 --> 33:59.169
- Yes.

34:00.339 --> 34:01.405
- Oh, brilliant.

34:02.241 --> 34:03.924
See?

34:03.925 --> 34:05.608
We'll make survival
experts out of you yet.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.411
- Just make sure you
keep on top of it.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.046
At night time, it's freezing.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.516
- [Sam] Help!

34:12.518 --> 34:13.450
Somebody help!

34:13.452 --> 34:15.152
Please, somebody help me!

34:17.689 --> 34:19.156
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:19.158 --> 34:22.125
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's okay,
you made it to base camp.

34:22.127 --> 34:24.261
It's all right now.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.829
- Please.

34:25.831 --> 34:26.797
Call the police.

34:26.799 --> 34:27.898
- Why, what for?

34:27.900 --> 34:28.832
- To call the police.
- What for?

34:28.834 --> 34:30.567
You're here now, it's okay.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.670
- I'm trying to explain,
but there's no time.

34:33.672 --> 34:35.172
- You just got a bit
lost, that's all.

34:35.174 --> 34:36.840
- I seen a body,
it was in the wood.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.076
- I assure you--
- No, no, no, no, no.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.077
- This place is very safe.

34:40.079 --> 34:41.845
Most of the land
here is private.

34:41.847 --> 34:43.213
- Yeah.
- No.

34:43.215 --> 34:45.282
There was a tent, and
it was everywhere,

34:45.284 --> 34:46.750
there was blood everywhere.

34:46.752 --> 34:48.785
- Are you sure you've
had any water all day?

34:48.787 --> 34:51.321
You know you might be
hallucinating if you're thirsty.

34:51.323 --> 34:52.889
- What?

34:52.891 --> 34:54.191
Are you guys thick?

34:54.193 --> 34:55.225
- Calm down.
- Are you stupid?

34:55.227 --> 34:57.027
- Shh.
- I've just told you

34:57.029 --> 34:59.029
I've seen a dead
body in the woods.

34:59.031 --> 35:00.263
- It's okay.

35:00.265 --> 35:01.765
- Where you're staying, here.

35:02.734 --> 35:04.601
- Guys, guys, this is great.

35:04.603 --> 35:05.969
Are you telling me this
is like one of those

35:05.971 --> 35:08.105
murder mystery type
weekends or something?

35:08.107 --> 35:09.573
Should we go look
for the body, yeah?

35:09.575 --> 35:10.407
- It's okay.

35:10.409 --> 35:11.441
- Do you know what?

35:11.443 --> 35:12.943
Fuck you lot.

35:12.945 --> 35:16.146
The first building I find,
I'm calling the police.

35:16.148 --> 35:17.414
Now fuck you!

35:17.416 --> 35:19.116
Fuck off!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:20.686 --> 35:21.585
Oh.

35:23.956 --> 35:26.690
(water flowing)

35:32.297 --> 35:33.196
- Okay.

35:34.766 --> 35:37.567
Joking aside, in all
seriousness, that
wasn't real, was it?

35:38.904 --> 35:42.005
Like, she was either
totally off her head,

35:42.007 --> 35:45.242
having a zone, or, that's
part of the survival weekend?

35:48.413 --> 35:49.479
- That girl,

35:50.315 --> 35:51.448
she's mental.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.987
(slow, dramatic music)

36:16.375 --> 36:21.444
(water flowing)
(people chattering)

36:30.289 --> 36:33.623
(slow, dramatic music)

36:40.265 --> 36:45.335
(water flowing)
(slow, dramatic music)

36:46.271 --> 36:48.672
(splashing)

36:51.476 --> 36:53.877
(splashing)

36:56.148 --> 37:01.151
(slow, dramatic music)
(water flowing)

37:29.147 --> 37:30.580
- I'm not being funny, Lance,
but we're gonna have to

37:30.582 --> 37:33.116
find those other campers.

37:33.118 --> 37:34.651
I know you dismissed
it a bit, but,

37:34.653 --> 37:37.487
strange things can
happen in these woods.

37:37.489 --> 37:38.388
- Hm.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.725
What do you suggest we do?

37:42.527 --> 37:43.426
- I dunno.

37:44.529 --> 37:48.331
We could send 'em on a
mile long perimeter jog

37:48.333 --> 37:50.867
and call it a training exercise.

37:52.204 --> 37:56.673
- I hate jogging, um, why don't
we ask them to do something

37:56.675 --> 37:59.142
that requires a lot of
time and concentration?

38:00.879 --> 38:01.911
- I've got an idea.

38:04.483 --> 38:07.784
(slow, dramatic music)

38:12.658 --> 38:14.891
Right, pumpkins.

38:14.893 --> 38:17.027
You're gonna make a big
soup, and it's gonna last

38:17.029 --> 38:18.828
for about three days.

38:18.830 --> 38:21.431
- You want us to make soup?

38:21.433 --> 38:23.800
- [Lance] No, Tommy, we want
you to play football with them.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.368
- Sweet, yes, good idea, cool.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.405
- Of course we want
you to make soup,

38:28.407 --> 38:31.141
with whatever you can
find around to cook with.

38:31.143 --> 38:32.375
- Hey, wait a minute,
shouldn't we be trying to find

38:32.377 --> 38:34.711
that Alex and that other crazy--

38:34.713 --> 38:36.246
- Don't you worry about that.

38:36.248 --> 38:38.715
You get on with the task,
me and Lance are gonna go

38:38.717 --> 38:41.384
off and find the other two and
we'll bring them back here.

38:41.386 --> 38:42.285
Okay?

38:43.689 --> 38:45.555
- And what if you
don't find them,

38:45.557 --> 38:47.891
and something happens
to us while you're gone?

38:47.893 --> 38:51.194
- You'll be okay, and
we'll be okay, all right?

38:52.030 --> 38:53.263
- Okay, ladies, come on.

38:53.265 --> 38:54.764
I'm starving, let's go.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.232
- Tommy, do you want to
start cutting the pumpkins

38:56.234 --> 38:58.835
into chunks and me and
Macie will see if we can

38:58.837 --> 39:00.270
find something to
start cooking in.

39:00.272 --> 39:02.339
- [Tommy] Fuck that,
I'm gonna build myself

39:02.341 --> 39:03.907
a Jack o' Lantern.

39:05.977 --> 39:09.279
(slow, dramatic music)

39:18.190 --> 39:23.259
(birds chirping)
(slow, dramatic music)

39:29.434 --> 39:34.504
(shallow breathing)
(slow, dramatic music)

39:51.156 --> 39:56.226
(shallow breathing)
(birds chirping)

40:11.777 --> 40:13.410
(underbrush crunches)

40:13.412 --> 40:16.946
(shallow breathing)

40:16.948 --> 40:18.348
- Tommy?

40:18.350 --> 40:20.884
Do you wanna bring those
pumpkin chunks over?

40:20.886 --> 40:22.419
The water's nearly boiled.

40:23.522 --> 40:27.056
- All right, yeah,
just give us a sec.

40:27.058 --> 40:32.128

41:00.892 --> 41:02.959
(yells)

41:08.667 --> 41:10.500
- Oh, my god.

41:10.502 --> 41:12.735
(yelling)

41:14.739 --> 41:16.105
- It bit my hand!

41:16.107 --> 41:18.475
It bit my fucking fingers off!

41:18.477 --> 41:20.610
(yells)
- It's okay, it's okay.

41:20.612 --> 41:21.878
Macie?

41:21.880 --> 41:23.146
- [Tommy] Will you
hurry the fuck up?

41:23.148 --> 41:23.980
- [Jen] Macie!

41:23.982 --> 41:25.281
Get the first aid kit.

41:25.283 --> 41:26.216
- Where?

41:26.218 --> 41:28.585
- [Jen] I don't fucking know!

41:31.923 --> 41:33.089
I don't know!

41:35.193 --> 41:39.095
(creature vocalizing)

41:39.097 --> 41:42.065
(dramatic rock music)

41:42.067 --> 41:45.101
- [Macie] Where are
his fucking fingers?

41:45.103 --> 41:48.137
- Will you just shut
up and do something?

41:48.139 --> 41:51.207
- [Macie] I'm fucking
doing something!

41:51.209 --> 41:52.509
- [Jen] Okay, I'm sorry.

41:52.511 --> 41:55.044
I'm sorry, this is
gonna hurt, sorry.

41:55.046 --> 41:56.012
(Tommy yells)

41:56.014 --> 41:57.914
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41:57.916 --> 41:59.115
It's all right.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.617
It's all right, it's okay.

42:00.619 --> 42:02.552
It's all right, it's just
gonna stop the bleeding.

42:02.554 --> 42:04.854
It's gonna stop the bleeding.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.856
It's gonna be okay,
it's gonna be okay.

42:06.858 --> 42:07.757
Okay.

42:09.227 --> 42:11.361
- Jen, did you hear that?

43:00.278 --> 43:02.912
- What a great start to
the survival weekend.

43:02.914 --> 43:04.781
- I couldn't agree more.

43:04.783 --> 43:08.318
- [Denise] What a
dysfunctional set of people.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.623
- Yep.

(sighs)

43:58.703 --> 44:00.470
You all right?

44:00.472 --> 44:01.304
- Yeah.

44:01.306 --> 44:02.405
I just hate people.

44:02.407 --> 44:04.440
- Anyone in particular?

44:04.442 --> 44:05.341
- No.

44:06.211 --> 44:08.511
I just hate people in general.

44:08.513 --> 44:09.812
- You're in the wrong job, mate.

44:09.814 --> 44:10.713
- I know, right?

44:13.151 --> 44:14.050
- All right.

44:16.788 --> 44:17.687
Okay.

44:20.058 --> 44:21.658
(birds chirping)

44:21.660 --> 44:22.892
Wait.

44:22.894 --> 44:24.394
Did you hear something?

44:24.396 --> 44:25.528
- Uh.

44:25.530 --> 44:27.130
No?

44:27.132 --> 44:28.831
- I could've sworn--

44:28.833 --> 44:30.266
Look.

44:30.268 --> 44:31.167
Over there.

44:34.205 --> 44:36.172
- Is that a pumpkin?

44:36.174 --> 44:38.641
(dramatic music)

44:38.643 --> 44:41.110
- Fuck, it's got blood on it.

44:49.320 --> 44:50.787

44:50.789 --> 44:51.688
Lance?

44:53.291 --> 44:55.358
(gasps)

44:57.629 --> 44:58.528
No!

44:59.831 --> 45:02.465

45:02.467 --> 45:03.833
Please, don't!

45:03.835 --> 45:05.568
Don't do it, please!

45:06.337 --> 45:07.637

45:07.639 --> 45:09.205

one, Mrs. Randall?

48:04.182 --> 48:05.147
- Terrance.

48:06.517 --> 48:08.818
- How many time have I got
to tell you, it's Terry.

48:08.820 --> 48:10.586
- I prefer to refer
to people by their

48:10.588 --> 48:11.988
proper Christian
names, thank you.

48:13.825 --> 48:16.525
- All right.
(laughing)

48:16.527 --> 48:17.793
- Careful, Terry.

48:17.795 --> 48:19.595
Carry on like that,
before you know it,

48:19.597 --> 48:22.765

48:26.371 --> 48:28.938
I bet she's right wrong
in the sack. (laughing)

48:30.174 --> 48:31.240

You can laugh all you like.

neck, and I said to him,

I said, "If you don't
wind your neck in, boy,

48:44.522 --> 48:47.356
"I'm gonna ram this red-hot
poker right up your asshole."

48:47.358 --> 48:48.291

you need a cold shower,

49:21.125 --> 49:24.527
I say, are you with
that rambling pack?

49:24.529 --> 49:25.895
- What?

49:25.897 --> 49:27.964
- Rambling, you know, ramblers.

49:27.966 --> 49:30.466
- Not a lot of them ramblers
around here lately, Stan.

49:30.468 --> 49:31.734
- Ah.

49:31.736 --> 49:33.169
- And doggers.
- What?

49:33.171 --> 49:34.437
- Doggers.

49:34.439 --> 49:35.871
- Dog walkers.

49:35.873 --> 49:37.073
- Yeah, that's what I meant.

49:37.075 --> 49:38.274
We had some strange
ramblers 'round

49:38.276 --> 49:39.342
here last week
though, didn't we?

49:39.344 --> 49:40.609
- Aye, the rough ramblers.

49:41.446 --> 49:42.345
- Naked ramblers.

49:43.548 --> 49:46.182
- Aye, you see, I've
never understood that.

49:46.184 --> 49:48.217
Can you get nettles in
your nether regions?

49:49.354 --> 49:50.386
- I need to call the police.

49:52.390 --> 49:53.689
- So why would you
want to do that for?

49:54.959 --> 49:55.858
- I seen something in the wood.

49:56.894 --> 49:58.294
It was terrible.

49:58.296 --> 49:59.628
- All right, come on darling,
tell us what you saw.

49:59.630 --> 50:00.563
- Where's your phone?

50:00.565 --> 50:02.064
I need to call the police.

50:02.066 --> 50:04.567
- Look, just calm down and--
- Don't tell me to calm down!

50:04.569 --> 50:07.470
There's a body in the
woods, without a head,

50:08.573 --> 50:10.573
so we need to call
the police now.

50:10.575 --> 50:12.375
- Aye, there's a lot
of strange stuff going

50:14.379 --> 50:15.445
on around the moors.

50:15.446 --> 50:16.512
You folk who aren't
from around here,

50:16.514 --> 50:17.847
you need to be more careful.

50:19.117 --> 50:21.117
You don't know moors like we do.

50:21.119 --> 50:22.651
- Aye.

50:22.653 --> 50:24.887
And you're best off steering
clear of them woods as well.

50:27.458 --> 50:28.457
- God.

50:28.458 --> 50:29.457
- Come on darling,
you've only had a fright.

50:29.460 --> 50:30.960
Let me take you to the phone,

50:30.962 --> 50:33.295
and we can sort this
out there, all right?

50:33.297 --> 50:34.196
- Let's go.

50:43.541 --> 50:44.490
- I'm leavin'.

50:44.491 --> 50:45.440
Let's see if I can find a
serial killer on the way home,

50:45.443 --> 50:46.942
with any luck.

50:46.944 --> 50:48.511
- Yeah, and being jumped
by an ax-wielding homicidal

50:48.513 --> 50:50.179
maniac works for me, too.

50:52.717 --> 50:53.582
- Welp, lads.

53:03.414 --> 53:04.547
You lost a shit load of blood.

53:05.316 --> 53:06.215

Don't walk off like that.

leaders, so I came to look.

54:15.786 --> 54:17.019

the lights went out.

weird going on out there.

57:06.257 --> 57:07.456

57:07.458 --> 57:10.659

calm down, will ya?

57:10.661 --> 57:12.428
- Well don't you look
at me like I'm an idiot.

57:12.430 --> 57:13.962
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

57:13.964 --> 57:16.632
I'm gonna go out there and
give 'em a bit of a poke.

57:16.634 --> 57:18.967
- Nobody is going
out there except her.

57:18.969 --> 57:20.068
She were the one that
brought that thing here,

57:20.070 --> 57:21.003
whatever it is.

57:21.005 --> 57:22.538
- I didn't bring anything here.

57:22.540 --> 57:23.872
- Yeah, well how do we know
it's not your bloody doing?

57:23.874 --> 57:26.542
- [Pam] Everybody quiet!

57:26.544 --> 57:28.577
Stan, get that body
out of the pub and shut

57:28.579 --> 57:30.078
the bloody door.

57:30.080 --> 57:31.647
- Oh, bloody hell.

57:40.324 --> 57:42.591
(door slams)
(Stan grunts)

57:42.593 --> 57:44.827
- Who cares who
brought what where.

57:44.829 --> 57:46.228
I'm more concerned
about the fact there's a

57:46.230 --> 57:47.830
killer in our woods.

57:47.832 --> 57:49.264
Now, if you lot are finished
flapping your skirts

57:49.266 --> 57:52.801
around long enough, we're gonna
lock the doors and windows

57:52.803 --> 57:54.336
and stay put.

57:54.338 --> 57:57.172
No one goes anywhere unless
either the police get here,

57:57.942 --> 57:59.341
or it's day light.

57:59.343 --> 58:00.843
Do I make myself clear?

58:00.845 --> 58:03.145
(grunting)

58:12.623 --> 58:14.256
- We can't stay here all night.

58:15.559 --> 58:17.159
- I feel weak.

58:17.161 --> 58:18.961
- We can't move.

58:18.963 --> 58:20.896
- We need a plan.

58:20.898 --> 58:21.797
We need to move fast.

58:23.033 --> 58:24.933
- I don't think I can.

58:26.237 --> 58:28.036
- You can stay here all night
if you like, Macie, but,

58:29.139 --> 58:32.007
personally I, I refuse
to die due to blood loss

58:32.009 --> 58:33.342
because of some fucking pumpkin.

58:35.145 --> 58:37.045
- I say we run.

58:37.047 --> 58:37.946
Same direction Sam went.

58:38.749 --> 58:40.249
She must've found somewhere.

58:40.251 --> 58:41.149
Otherwise she
would've come back.

58:42.253 --> 58:43.151
- Like Lance and Denise.

58:44.488 --> 58:45.787
- Maybe they're all dead.

58:47.157 --> 58:49.491
Yeah, this is a perfect
place for us to be killed.

58:50.828 --> 58:52.327
This is a horror film
waiting to fucking happen.

58:52.329 --> 58:53.295
- Shh.

58:53.297 --> 58:54.563
Stop it!

58:54.565 --> 58:55.464
Stay focused.

58:56.734 --> 58:58.066
Right.

58:58.068 --> 58:58.934
I'm gonna count to three.

59:00.037 --> 59:02.170
And then we're gonna
run as fast as we can

59:02.172 --> 59:03.839
through the woods
until we get out, okay?

59:05.376 --> 59:06.375
- Okay.
- Okay.

59:09.547 --> 59:10.445
- One,

59:12.016 --> 59:12.915
two,

59:14.118 --> 59:15.017
three.

59:16.854 --> 59:20.188
(slow, dramatic music)

59:41.745 --> 59:43.312
- [Tommy] Oh, Jen!

59:45.482 --> 59:48.784
(slow, dramatic music)

59:53.490 --> 59:54.323
(heavy breathing)

59:54.325 --> 59:57.125
(Macie yelps)

59:57.127 --> 59:58.293
- Guys, wait.

59:59.730 --> 1:00:02.631
(heavy breathing)

1:00:09.506 --> 1:00:10.405
Guys?

1:00:12.876 --> 1:00:17.946
(heavy breathing)
(slow, dramatic synth music)

1:00:27.191 --> 1:00:32.260
(choking)
(slow, dramatic synth music)

1:00:48.078 --> 1:00:53.115
(slow, dramatic synth music)
(whimpering)

1:00:55.352 --> 1:00:57.452
(screaming)

1:01:00.724 --> 1:01:01.623
- Come on.

1:01:03.527 --> 1:01:05.327
There's a pub, Tommy.

1:01:07.931 --> 1:01:09.164
Where's Macie?

1:01:10.167 --> 1:01:11.967
Tommy, where the fuck is Macie?

1:01:11.969 --> 1:01:13.201
- Shit.

1:01:13.203 --> 1:01:14.436
(grunts)

1:01:14.438 --> 1:01:16.204
- You've gotta get up, come on.

1:01:16.206 --> 1:01:18.640
We need to just get safe
and get into that pub.

1:01:20.444 --> 1:01:23.145
Come on, there's gotta
be people in there,

1:01:23.147 --> 1:01:25.647
and we're gonna be all right.

1:01:35.526 --> 1:01:38.193
(wind blowing)

1:01:39.930 --> 1:01:41.596
(pounding on door)

1:01:41.598 --> 1:01:42.831
Hello?

1:01:42.833 --> 1:01:43.865
Please!

1:01:43.867 --> 1:01:46.735
Is there someone in there?

1:01:46.737 --> 1:01:49.337
(wind blowing)

1:01:50.641 --> 1:01:53.575
(pounding on door)

1:01:56.280 --> 1:01:58.880
(wind blowing)

1:02:15.365 --> 1:02:16.665
- We should let
her in, you know.

1:02:16.667 --> 1:02:18.133
- Why?

1:02:18.135 --> 1:02:19.101
- She's one of the campers
that I was with from earlier.

1:02:20.070 --> 1:02:21.837
They've been in the woods.

1:02:21.839 --> 1:02:23.205
- [Jen] Please!

1:02:23.207 --> 1:02:24.740
We've been attacked,
my friend's bleeding.

1:02:25.809 --> 1:02:26.942
- [Stan] Oh, you'd
best let her in, love.

1:02:33.350 --> 1:02:34.449
(wind blowing)

1:02:34.451 --> 1:02:37.552
Oh bloody hell, get him in here.

1:02:37.554 --> 1:02:42.224
Come here. (grunts)

1:02:47.164 --> 1:02:49.798
(wind blowing)

1:02:50.834 --> 1:02:53.635
(Tommy grunting)

1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:04.412
- [Pam] What happened?

1:03:04.414 --> 1:03:05.647
- He was bitten.

1:03:05.649 --> 1:03:07.382
He bit his fingers
off and then Macie,

1:03:09.286 --> 1:03:10.185
we lost her in the woods.

1:03:11.455 --> 1:03:12.354
I heard her scream.

1:03:13.257 --> 1:03:14.756
- [Tommy] Pumpkin.

1:03:14.758 --> 1:03:15.657
- What?

1:03:15.659 --> 1:03:17.125
(Tommy whimpers)

1:03:17.127 --> 1:03:18.026
What happened to
the camp guides?

1:03:18.829 --> 1:03:19.728
- They went missing, too.

1:03:20.531 --> 1:03:21.429
They never came back.

1:03:22.566 --> 1:03:23.431
I don't know what
happened to them.

1:03:24.234 --> 1:03:25.700
- I think I know.

1:03:26.937 --> 1:03:28.170
- What do you mean?

1:03:28.172 --> 1:03:29.204
- Didn't you see the
body outside the door?

1:03:31.408 --> 1:03:32.507
- What body?

1:03:32.509 --> 1:03:33.408
- Huh?

1:03:35.512 --> 1:03:38.480
(wind blowing)

1:03:38.482 --> 1:03:40.982
(man coughs)

1:03:43.020 --> 1:03:45.687
(wind blowing)

1:04:04.675 --> 1:04:05.740
- It's gone.

1:04:08.145 --> 1:04:10.111
The bloody body's gone.

1:04:10.881 --> 1:04:11.780
- All right.

1:04:11.782 --> 1:04:12.881
That's it.

1:04:12.883 --> 1:04:14.082
This shit is pissing me off.

1:04:14.084 --> 1:04:14.983
Who's coming with me?

1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:17.819
Well I'm not waiting around
here to get picked off

1:04:17.821 --> 1:04:20.422
one by one like in some
shitty horror movie.

1:04:20.424 --> 1:04:22.057
I'm going out there
and I'm gonna shoot it,

1:04:22.059 --> 1:04:24.192
and if I have to, I'll kill it.

1:04:24.995 --> 1:04:26.361
- [Man] Right, I'm
with you, miss.

1:04:26.363 --> 1:04:28.230
- I gotta try and find Macie.

1:04:28.232 --> 1:04:29.965
I'm coming with you.

1:04:32.269 --> 1:04:34.936
(wind blowing)

1:05:02.132 --> 1:05:04.366
- Oh, bloody hell,

1:05:04.368 --> 1:05:05.267
I'm gonna go get me big coat.

1:05:10.207 --> 1:05:11.873
- Terrance?
- What?

1:05:12.943 --> 1:05:15.210
- Where's Clive?

1:05:15.212 --> 1:05:18.146
- Clive, we took one
step outside the pub,

1:05:18.148 --> 1:05:19.381
and he's off on his toes home,

1:05:20.450 --> 1:05:21.483
skidding on his shits.

1:05:22.753 --> 1:05:23.652
Yellow bellied bastard.

1:05:24.855 --> 1:05:26.721
And what happened to
them mariachi fellas?

1:05:27.524 --> 1:05:28.556

1:05:37.567 --> 1:05:38.733
Come on, son.

1:05:38.735 --> 1:05:39.968

He's a pumpkin!

1:07:36.887 --> 1:07:40.121

1:08:03.814 --> 1:08:05.580
- [Pam] Stan!

1:08:05.582 --> 1:08:10.218
- Leave him there, he's
better if he thinks he's dead.

1:08:10.220 --> 1:08:13.121
(Stan whimpering)

1:08:19.129 --> 1:08:21.963

1:08:23.467 --> 1:08:26.768
(slow, dramatic music)

1:08:33.477 --> 1:08:35.677
You can't go back,
you need to stay here.

1:08:35.679 --> 1:08:36.945
- No.

1:08:36.947 --> 1:08:38.546
Stan's--

1:08:38.548 --> 1:08:40.181
- You can't go back.

1:08:40.183 --> 1:08:44.652
You just need to calm down,
we've got to leave him.

1:08:44.654 --> 1:08:46.054
- What happened?

1:08:49.659 --> 1:08:51.726
- The man, pumpkin head.

1:08:54.831 --> 1:08:56.064
- [Mrs. Randall] Go see if
you can get the door open.

1:08:56.066 --> 1:08:59.234
- But they've locked us out.
- Just go!

1:09:01.404 --> 1:09:02.971
- You can't go after Stan.

1:09:02.973 --> 1:09:05.974
Stan's dead, Pam, Stan's dead.
- No!

1:09:07.711 --> 1:09:10.311
(Pam sobbing)
- He's not coming back.

1:09:10.313 --> 1:09:11.212
Oh, Stan.

1:09:13.383 --> 1:09:17.118

1:09:17.988 --> 1:09:19.354
(pounding)

1:09:19.356 --> 1:09:21.856
- [Man] Open the door.

1:09:21.858 --> 1:09:24.859
Come on, you need
to let us in now.

1:09:26.429 --> 1:09:27.829
- Don't you fucking
dare open that door.

1:09:28.665 --> 1:09:29.898
We're safe in here.

1:09:29.900 --> 1:09:30.798
No fucking way!

1:15:55.518 --> 1:15:59.220
(dramatic synth rock music)

1:16:55.044 --> 1:16:57.345
(knocking)

1:17:01.150 --> 1:17:02.450
- Trick or treat.

1:17:02.452 --> 1:17:03.284
(gasps)

1:17:03.286 --> 1:17:05.152
- What a scary costume.

1:17:05.154 --> 1:17:06.120
- Thank you.

1:17:06.122 --> 1:17:07.355
- Now,

1:17:07.357 --> 1:17:08.255
would you like

1:17:09.392 --> 1:17:10.858
sweets, or chocolate?

1:17:11.928 --> 1:17:13.527
- Chocolate, please.
- There you go.

1:17:13.529 --> 1:17:14.595
- Thank you.

1:17:27.644 --> 1:17:29.143
This is all mine.

1:17:35.785 --> 1:17:39.186
(eerie, dramatic music)

1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:13.854
(Mia screaming)
