00:02.263 --> 00:03.394
<i>Previously on</i>
Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.438 --> 00:04.830
Why are you smiling?

00:04.874 --> 00:06.267
Because this will bring about
the alighting.

00:06.310 --> 00:07.485
How do you know that word?

00:07.529 --> 00:09.009
All I know is
that the alighting

00:09.052 --> 00:09.966
wasn't complete
without you and...

00:10.010 --> 00:11.402
And Liz?

00:11.446 --> 00:12.838
<i>Your dad's Bible,</i> <i>
I recognize it.</i>

00:12.882 --> 00:14.449
<i>I saw it in Bonnie's cave.</i>

00:14.492 --> 00:16.320
<i>We know that</i> <i>
you have memories from 1947.</i>

00:16.364 --> 00:17.452
Just focus on that Bible,

00:17.495 --> 00:18.844
<i>and I'll do the rest.</i>

00:18.888 --> 00:19.845
Wait, did you see that?

00:19.889 --> 00:20.890
<i>The glasses are the key</i>

00:20.933 --> 00:21.934
to decoding my dad's Bible.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.023
I can't talk to my mom

00:23.066 --> 00:24.111
in my visions anymore,

00:24.154 --> 00:25.460
<i>but maybe she's trying to find</i>

00:25.503 --> 00:26.591
<i>another way to communicate</i> <i>
with me.</i>

00:26.635 --> 00:28.158
<i>Bonnie kissed you</i>

00:28.202 --> 00:29.333
<i>so she could disable</i> <i>
your powers.</i>

00:29.377 --> 00:30.813
There's a rift in our Triad.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.858
<i>Clyde has been questioning</i> <i>
her leadership.</i>

00:32.902 --> 00:34.599
I tipped that machete
in Bonnie's virus.

00:34.643 --> 00:37.037
<i>Tezca wants to use my abilities</i>

00:37.080 --> 00:38.864
<i>for the alighting,</i> <i>
and I can't let that happen.</i>

00:38.908 --> 00:41.302
<i>You said you wanted to use</i> <i>
your powers for good.</i>

00:41.345 --> 00:43.521
<i>It's the only way.</i> What did you do?

00:51.747 --> 00:52.878
Handprint's gone.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.793
You kissed her, didn't you?

00:56.795 --> 01:00.582
Um, you have to know,
I mean, it was nothing romantic.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.279
What it was...

01:02.323 --> 01:04.803
was a complete
lack of regard for me.

01:04.847 --> 01:06.240
No, I did this for you.

01:06.283 --> 01:08.372
Making a decision
that is about the both of us

01:08.416 --> 01:10.374
without asking what I think
is not about me.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.768
Max, that is all about you.

01:14.596 --> 01:17.077
I was worried that if I told
you, you'd talk me out of it.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.121
Because someone should have.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.383
Liz, can't-can't you see

01:19.427 --> 01:20.732
that these abilities
make me dangerous

01:20.776 --> 01:21.951
not only to you

01:21.994 --> 01:23.779
but to every single person
we care about?

01:23.822 --> 01:26.086
And why can't you see

01:26.129 --> 01:28.175
we would've found
our way through it?

01:28.218 --> 01:29.393
How?

01:29.437 --> 01:31.265
I mean, you know
what happened

01:31.308 --> 01:32.701
when I kissed you.

01:32.744 --> 01:35.573
Stop making me the banner
for your decisions.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.749
Now I have two aliens
without powers

01:37.793 --> 01:39.490
in the fight
against the Dark Triad.

01:39.534 --> 01:41.057
Right. Well, Tezca only wanted
me for the blue flame.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.016
But now that I don't have it,
I'm of no value to them.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.931
That is a huge gamble to make

01:45.975 --> 01:48.238
with the life of the woman
you intend to marry.

01:50.893 --> 01:53.417
Do I need to remind you
they want me, too?

01:53.461 --> 01:55.463
I know, I know,
and I can protect you.

01:55.506 --> 01:56.507
No, Max.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.945
The truth is you are scared

01:59.989 --> 02:01.599
of embracing
who you really are.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.471
And instead of
finding the courage

02:03.514 --> 02:06.561
to step into the future,
you threw it all away.

02:08.302 --> 02:10.652
This is a combo flu shot.

02:10.695 --> 02:11.870
It helped Michael

02:11.914 --> 02:13.350
and it should prevent you
from getting sick.

02:13.394 --> 02:15.222
But since you seem to prefer

02:15.265 --> 02:16.919
to make your decisions
on your own...

02:17.920 --> 02:19.356
So, while you deal with that,

02:19.400 --> 02:21.837
I need to figure out
where we go from here.

02:37.853 --> 02:39.637
Uh, isn't it, uh,

02:39.681 --> 02:41.030
a little early for cocktails?

02:41.073 --> 02:43.859
Well, this cook from
a place called Flavortown

02:43.902 --> 02:46.122
says Bloody Marys are
appropriate at any hour

02:46.166 --> 02:47.993
and a necessity for an omelet.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.212
You look like you need one.

02:50.561 --> 02:52.172
Max, everything okay?

02:52.215 --> 02:54.174
Uh, no, I got a...

02:54.217 --> 02:57.655
I got a tip from the station
that 40 gallons of paint thinner

02:57.699 --> 02:59.875
went missing from an artist's
retreat outside of town.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.224
Since paint thinner is...

03:01.268 --> 03:03.008
Condensed acetone.

03:03.052 --> 03:05.054
You think there must be
an alien application.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.055
Well, there is.

03:06.098 --> 03:07.578
Tezca uses that stuff

03:07.622 --> 03:09.493
to help her body recover
when she shapeshifts too much.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.539
Which means she's hurt.

03:12.540 --> 03:13.802
It's the time to strike.

03:13.845 --> 03:14.803
With what?

03:14.846 --> 03:15.891
Harsh language?

03:15.934 --> 03:17.066
We don't have powers.

03:17.109 --> 03:18.372
We don't need powers

03:18.415 --> 03:20.243
to divide Tezca and Clyde.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.375
Look...

03:22.767 --> 03:24.247
You said Clyde was already
starting to doubt her.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.597
Well, Clyde puts Ophiuchus
philosophy above everything

03:26.641 --> 03:28.469
and Tezca tends to bend
the rules.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.558
So we lean into that.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.864
If you can convince Clyde
Tezca's strayed,

03:32.908 --> 03:33.909
that's a start.

03:33.952 --> 03:35.693
No. That's no good.

03:35.737 --> 03:37.782
Tezca had to have
already filled in Clyde

03:37.826 --> 03:39.523
that Bonnie got arrested
and betrayed them.

03:39.567 --> 03:43.179
Unless I convince him I did it
because I feared her.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.920
He's very protective
of me,

03:44.963 --> 03:46.051
he'll listen.

03:46.095 --> 03:47.357
I'm going with.

03:47.401 --> 03:48.619
Help sell the story.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.534
Listen,
Clyde's a pragmatist.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.232
So, if we intrigue him
that we can help him

03:52.275 --> 03:54.277
get what he wants,
he will bite.

03:54.321 --> 03:55.974
So, what does he want?

03:56.975 --> 03:58.325
He wants to go home.

03:58.368 --> 04:00.196
Does he have the means
to do that?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.632
Clyde needs three things.

04:01.676 --> 04:03.068
He's got two of them.

04:03.112 --> 04:04.853
Yeah, the first is the fruit
from the tree.

04:04.896 --> 04:07.377
- Clyde says it's fuel.
- And the second?

04:08.770 --> 04:10.424
It's a map.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.955
From here...

04:21.348 --> 04:23.567
...to Oasis.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.488
That's home.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.101
Here's what I'm thinking.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.451
Fuel plus map

04:37.494 --> 04:39.279
equals...
Ship.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.584
Yep.

04:40.628 --> 04:42.064
Clyde said that
he thought with Michael's help

04:42.107 --> 04:44.327
he might be able to find
what he's been unable to.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.982
So, I show up and
I offer my services.

04:47.025 --> 04:49.898
And I give him this map
as a sign that,

04:49.941 --> 04:51.943
yeah, things might've
gotten thick,

04:51.987 --> 04:54.294
but we're still
on the same page.

04:58.559 --> 05:02.345
Any, uh, progress
on your alien virus?

05:02.389 --> 05:05.130
Tiny bubbles can have
big answers.

05:06.784 --> 05:09.439
My usual problem-solver is
merlot with a Morissette chaser.

05:09.483 --> 05:11.267
Mm, when I'm stuck,
it's Kate Bush.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.704
I could play some for you
if you think it would help.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.141
What are you stuck on?

05:16.185 --> 05:18.230
Oh, this isn't
problem-solving prosecco.

05:18.274 --> 05:19.493
This is for celebrating.

05:19.536 --> 05:23.888
I just acquired
a cryogenics company

05:23.932 --> 05:25.194
in New York.

05:25.237 --> 05:28.415
And I am wheels up to go there
in two hours.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.682
Hey, you think I could
catch a flight?

05:35.813 --> 05:38.120
Could use a minute
out of Roswell.

05:38.163 --> 05:41.471
Should I send a car
to fetch that man of yours?

05:41.515 --> 05:43.430
At least some of those seconds
in that minute

05:43.473 --> 05:44.822
are attributed to him.

05:45.606 --> 05:47.564
They say a wild girls' weekend

05:47.608 --> 05:49.523
is the perfect medicine

05:49.566 --> 05:51.307
for relationship woes.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.178
Oh, I appreciate it, but...

05:53.222 --> 05:56.181
I got a cousin I am long overdue
to check in on.

05:56.225 --> 05:57.357
Ah.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.662
Oh, uh,

05:58.706 --> 06:02.013
I have reservations
for sunset tapas.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.928
So you can treat your cousin
if you want.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.365
It'd be amazing.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.541
Yeah.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.891
After last night,
this is gonna be

06:09.934 --> 06:12.110
like stepping into a warm bath.

06:13.155 --> 06:16.201
Okay, since when do we need
the full spa package

06:16.245 --> 06:17.202
for a mindscape?

06:17.246 --> 06:19.117
Since, uh, Theo

06:19.161 --> 06:20.510
locked up your memories

06:20.554 --> 06:22.033
trying to protect you,
I figured we could use

06:22.077 --> 06:24.688
the entire, uh,
earth, wind and fire.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.603
Meaning,
finding my dad's glasses

06:26.647 --> 06:28.823
and decoding his Bible
would be impossible.

06:28.866 --> 06:30.694
No, no. No, it's not impossible.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.044
It's just... it's tricky.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.046
Maria had to use
vision-inducing drugs

06:35.090 --> 06:36.700
to access
her subconscious.

06:36.744 --> 06:39.094
But your superpower is water.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.966
So we're gonna use that
as a conduit.

06:42.967 --> 06:43.968
Welcome

06:44.012 --> 06:46.449
- to the Hot Tub Time Machine.
- Oh.

06:47.276 --> 06:48.886
Okay, thank you.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.672
You know,
the tricky part,

06:51.715 --> 06:53.325
really, is just gonna be, um,

06:53.369 --> 06:56.111
breaking down any barriers
that your father might have...

06:56.154 --> 06:57.678
erected...

06:57.721 --> 06:59.462
in your, um...

06:59.506 --> 07:00.724
Okay.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.160
Uh, well, look, I'm sold.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.467
- Uh, what next, sensei?
- Just to make sure,

07:04.511 --> 07:06.600
you're not, like...

07:06.643 --> 07:08.428
harboring any secret feelings
for me, are you?

07:08.471 --> 07:10.430
Just here to get
my dad's glasses.

07:10.473 --> 07:11.996
Yeah.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.258
That's good. Yeah.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.435
Me, too.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.001
They're not in my trunks.

07:17.045 --> 07:18.438
It's like, I thought that
it would be less awkward

07:18.481 --> 07:20.440
- if I didn't make eye contact.
- Nah.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.093
I see that
that's a mistake now.

07:22.137 --> 07:23.617
You know, it's 'cause
I think I'm being

07:23.660 --> 07:25.140
a little paranoid recently.
I kind of...

07:25.183 --> 07:27.534
Mm-hmm....have realized that
I have certain...

07:27.577 --> 07:28.970
blind spots in my life.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.102
Like the doctor
who's currently in Mexico?

07:31.146 --> 07:33.540
You know, this is actually not
about my mindscape.

07:33.583 --> 07:36.238
This is about you, so just...

07:36.281 --> 07:37.457
whenever you're ready.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.980
Bloop.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.987
I am sorry for these
complications to the mission,

07:46.030 --> 07:48.119
but I assure you
they will be overcome.

07:48.163 --> 07:51.471
You are the ever-dutiful
soldier, aren't you?

07:51.514 --> 07:55.257
Our-our leader understood
how powerful loyalty could be.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.519
Unlike Bonnie.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.216
She can be naiïve.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.524
But she's... Betrayed us.

08:01.568 --> 08:04.135
for Earthen trinkets
and endeavors.

08:04.179 --> 08:07.312
She has no place
in this Triad anymore.

08:09.401 --> 08:10.664
I will fix this.

08:11.665 --> 08:13.014
But, uh...

08:13.057 --> 08:15.320
to be certain the alighting
is brought about,

08:15.364 --> 08:18.323
perhaps it's time for you
to share with me the location...

08:18.367 --> 08:21.936
There's a reason Jones placed
his secrets in my trust.

08:21.979 --> 08:24.242
I was merely trying to help.

08:24.286 --> 08:25.635
Then give me your arm.

08:25.679 --> 08:26.897
My arm?

08:26.941 --> 08:29.509
To expedite
the cleansing process.

08:29.552 --> 08:30.814
Unless you see

08:30.858 --> 08:33.121
a better way
to achieving the alighting.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.169
Of course, Tezca.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.265
Long live Ophiuchus.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.407
MARIA:Okay, Mom, if you're
trying to talk,

08:58.450 --> 08:59.582
this is me trying to listen.

09:00.975 --> 09:03.978
Sometimes when you'd go missing,
I'd find you here.

09:04.021 --> 09:06.981
I want you to be at peace, but...

09:07.024 --> 09:10.332
I'm running out of answers.

09:10.375 --> 09:14.728
And after yesterday,
I'm just starting to feel crazy.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.384
Are you trying to talk to me?

09:19.428 --> 09:22.736
Please, please, Mom, just...

09:22.779 --> 09:24.738
give me a sign.

09:31.266 --> 09:32.702
Is this a sign?

09:33.834 --> 09:35.400
No.

09:35.444 --> 09:38.578
It's just a waste of time.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.981
Uncle Roy? Uncle Roy!

09:52.940 --> 09:54.419
Well, apparently
you were close enough

09:54.463 --> 09:57.248
to Maria's great-grandfather
to call him uncle.

09:57.292 --> 09:59.642
Mind waiting outside
a minute, kid?

09:59.686 --> 10:01.383
I got some grown folks'
business.

10:09.304 --> 10:10.566
Peach pie.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.874
Look who it is.

10:13.917 --> 10:16.180
Courtesy of Louise.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.573
She wishes y'all could come
to the Long Farm

10:17.617 --> 10:18.661
and enjoy it with us.

10:20.184 --> 10:22.360
You having any luck on getting
your own farm yet?

10:22.404 --> 10:25.102
Every time I apply
for a land purchase,

10:25.146 --> 10:26.800
it mysteriously just gets sold.

10:26.843 --> 10:28.410
Mm.
But I won't give up,

10:28.453 --> 10:30.020
I'll find a plot eventually.

10:30.064 --> 10:31.718
Someplace where me and Louise
can raise our family safe,

10:31.761 --> 10:32.806
and Nora can work.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.459
How is her project coming along?

10:34.503 --> 10:36.984
BRONSON:It's almost finished
and impressive,

10:37.027 --> 10:39.421
but that's not why I'm here.

10:41.205 --> 10:43.686
Look, I know you don't
want to hear it,

10:43.730 --> 10:45.209
but Louise wants you to rethink

10:45.253 --> 10:46.776
letting your boy remain
out of his pod.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.473
She says it's dangerous.

10:48.517 --> 10:49.953
Especially after
what happened back on Oasis,

10:49.997 --> 10:51.433
with her daughter's teacher.

10:51.476 --> 10:53.609
Kids are meant to run,

10:53.653 --> 10:55.176
play and explore.

10:56.264 --> 11:00.137
My son needs to be out here,
so I can teach and love him.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.183
You know how to raise your son,

11:02.226 --> 11:03.488
but remember,

11:03.532 --> 11:05.882
what you put on a chess board

11:05.926 --> 11:07.492
can become a chess piece.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.016
All right.

11:13.063 --> 11:15.979
A chess board?
Chess piece? What...

11:16.023 --> 11:18.286
Wh-What game is he
talking about?

11:18.329 --> 11:19.679
Project Shepherd, maybe.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.158
Or something to do with Jones.

11:21.202 --> 11:22.899
I don't know. I think
we need to keep exploring.

11:22.943 --> 11:24.640
And that stuff
about your teacher?

11:24.684 --> 11:28.209
Yeah, I don't know. I-I don't
have any memories from Oasis.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.995
Whatever it was, it must've
been bad enough to, uh,

11:32.039 --> 11:33.823
put me in a pod,
separate me from my mom.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.392
You know what,
let's move on.

11:37.435 --> 11:39.437
Where does this memory
want you to go next?

11:42.876 --> 11:45.052
Well, let there be light.

11:50.622 --> 11:52.320
Liz!

11:53.582 --> 11:55.323
Okay, now, tell me.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.542
Is everybody okay? Papi?

11:57.586 --> 11:59.240
Yeah, no. Papi's fine.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.721
<i>Siempre con lo mismo.</i>
He's... Thank you.

12:01.764 --> 12:05.028
Huh?
...finally mastered
his enchilada recipe,

12:05.072 --> 12:06.856
just in time for
the Hatch Day Party.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.336
Which was a nice break

12:08.379 --> 12:10.555
from trying to Ms. Frizzle
my GED students

12:10.599 --> 12:11.818
onto the Magic School Bus.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.776
And what about
Chocolate Chip?

12:13.820 --> 12:15.386
Is he treating my sister well?

12:15.430 --> 12:19.260
♪ Never had to knock on wood I don't know.

12:19.303 --> 12:21.784
Max is making me feel kind of...

12:21.828 --> 12:23.786
Oh, hi.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.398
Liz, this is...
These are my roommates.

12:27.442 --> 12:28.878
This is Zephyr and Juliana.

12:28.922 --> 12:31.925
The famous cousin Liz
Rosalinda's always mentioning.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.057
Can we talk about
how gorgeous she is?

12:34.101 --> 12:36.930
Oh, my God.

12:36.973 --> 12:39.497
We are so excited to meet you.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.064
You have to see
what Rosalinda's working on.

12:41.108 --> 12:42.413
Okay, <i>no puedo contigo.</i>

12:42.457 --> 12:43.763
Liz doesn't want to hear
about this right now.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.286
No, of course I do.

12:45.329 --> 12:47.331
Well, I'm not the best
at humble bragging, all right?

12:47.375 --> 12:49.333
But that's enough about me.
I want the <i>chisme.</i>

12:49.377 --> 12:51.814
Uh, perhaps the <i>chisme</i>
after dim sum later.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.860
We're actually about to head out
to the art installation in SoHo.

12:53.903 --> 12:56.906
- Got to go.
- You guys should just go without me, honestly.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.603
- No.
- Lady Teelan will be there.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.475
You've been dying for
an introduction for weeks.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.564
You know what? Go, go, go.
I just got off a plane.

13:02.607 --> 13:05.436
- I could use a nap and a shower.
- Are you sure?

13:05.480 --> 13:08.004
Yeah. Yeah.
Uh, dinner later?

13:08.048 --> 13:09.484
I got this fancy reservation.

13:09.527 --> 13:11.051
Yeah, that's awesome.

13:11.094 --> 13:12.835
Let's go. Okay. Bye.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.663
Have fun.

13:14.706 --> 13:17.361
♪ That's the impression
that I get. ♪

13:18.145 --> 13:20.930
I can't help feeling
like I failed you.

13:22.410 --> 13:25.108
You gave me purpose.

13:25.152 --> 13:28.285
Please show me the way
again once more.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.683
Tezca said you turned on us.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.119
Attacked her.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.556
You here to try and end me, too?

13:38.600 --> 13:41.124
I'm here to tell you
that I had no choice.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.431
I was afraid for my life.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.128
Tezca tried to kill her.

13:45.172 --> 13:47.391
Why would she turn on one of
her own Triad?

13:47.435 --> 13:49.045
Because I refused
to do something

13:49.089 --> 13:50.699
that you deemed foolish.

13:50.742 --> 13:53.223
She wanted me to kill
the son of the dictator.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.357
My feelings were pretty hurt, too.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.925
A-And when I questioned
if this was your will as well...

13:58.968 --> 14:00.883
I have sacrificed so much.

14:02.319 --> 14:04.844
Tezca cares little
for my insight.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.543
We don't need her.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.372
To find the final piece, do we?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.070
We do not.

14:15.202 --> 14:17.378
Why should I trust you?

14:17.421 --> 14:18.335
Either of you?

14:18.379 --> 14:20.685
Because you saved me on Oasis.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.165
You made me feel
like I mattered.

14:22.209 --> 14:25.038
And this quest to return home,
i-it matters to you.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.258
How could I not help?

14:29.694 --> 14:31.174
Seeing home has mattered to me

14:31.218 --> 14:33.046
since the first time
I looked in the sky.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.879
I assume you gave me this--

14:39.922 --> 14:43.491
this map-- to let me dream
about that possibility, yeah?

14:45.014 --> 14:47.712
Well, I don't want to dream
any longer.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.018
The final piece,

14:49.062 --> 14:50.541
it's a ship, isn't it?

14:50.585 --> 14:52.239
One that my mother built?

14:59.159 --> 15:01.378
All I've ever wanted to do
is find it.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.213
I think it's time to explain

15:10.257 --> 15:12.563
the quandary Tezca left us
to decipher.

15:13.347 --> 15:16.611
And bring about the alighting
once and for all.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.969
You're sure Bronson
owned property in 1947?

15:27.013 --> 15:28.405
'Cause neither digital files

15:28.449 --> 15:30.233
nor these manual logs
show that he did.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.235
Clyde told me and Bonnie
that Tezca believed

15:32.279 --> 15:34.237
there was a connection
between land Bronson bought

15:34.281 --> 15:35.847
and this final piece
that Jones tasked them

15:35.891 --> 15:37.762
to acquire so they can go home.

15:37.806 --> 15:40.591
There's something on this lost
piece of land that they need.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.158
Uh, what, because...

15:42.202 --> 15:45.422
Because if my mother built
the ship they're looking for,

15:45.466 --> 15:47.816
they'd need a farm
big enough to hide it.

15:47.859 --> 15:51.951
Right. And if we find that link,
then you can finally complete

15:51.994 --> 15:54.127
the, uh, hunt you started
decades ago.

15:55.171 --> 15:56.694
You want to talk about

15:56.738 --> 15:59.567
why you, uh, hid the star map
from the rest of us?

15:59.610 --> 16:02.135
I was always gonna
tell you about it.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.789
Judging from that map,

16:04.833 --> 16:06.791
it, uh, looks like a long trip.

16:06.835 --> 16:08.750
Years, right?

16:08.793 --> 16:10.708
All depends on
the engine capabilities

16:10.752 --> 16:11.840
of my mother's ship.

16:11.883 --> 16:13.276
And Alex is cool

16:13.320 --> 16:15.887
with a decades-long
nonstop flight

16:15.931 --> 16:16.976
across the galaxy?

16:18.238 --> 16:20.283
Obviously there are
discussions to be had.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.806
Ah, so you do want to go home.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.721
What I want is to know
where I come from.

16:23.765 --> 16:26.115
Just because you try burying
questions about Oasis

16:26.159 --> 16:28.161
doesn't mean that
I can't be asking them.

16:28.204 --> 16:29.379
Okay, now that I've tried
a doughnut,

16:29.423 --> 16:30.815
I'm ready to help
find this farm

16:30.859 --> 16:33.427
where the ship must be hidden.

16:33.470 --> 16:34.645
"Sale denied.

16:34.689 --> 16:37.474
"No person of any race
other than Caucasian

16:37.518 --> 16:39.476
"may use or occupy the property,

16:39.520 --> 16:41.565
with the exception
of domestic servants."

16:41.609 --> 16:45.439
What you are holding is a
property restriction ordinance.

16:45.482 --> 16:49.095
Black people were forbidden
from buying houses or land

16:49.138 --> 16:51.488
in certain areas.

16:51.532 --> 16:53.186
Sadly, not everything
on Earth is

16:53.229 --> 16:54.839
Patty Meltdowns and doughnuts.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.189
That doesn't seem fair.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.452
It's an ugly ongoing
chapter of human history

16:58.495 --> 17:00.236
that sometimes
leads to violence,

17:00.280 --> 17:01.890
and is often covered up.

17:03.065 --> 17:06.199
I didn't think Earth had
the same evil streak as Oasis.

17:06.242 --> 17:08.201
Well, there's evil everywhere.

17:09.898 --> 17:12.988
You know, I don't think
we're gonna find anything here.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.077
Bronson couldn't
own land in '47.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.124
Well, what if he...

17:18.167 --> 17:20.387
what if he put it
under someone else's name?

17:21.736 --> 17:22.911
Someone Caucasian.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.044
Someone he cared for.

17:25.087 --> 17:27.307
And trusted.

17:27.350 --> 17:29.483
Walt Sanders.

17:29.526 --> 17:31.572
Okay, so how was
the SoHo exhibit?

17:31.615 --> 17:35.097
Oh, okay,
it was really good.
Yeah?

17:35.141 --> 17:36.925
Great, you guys got
my favorite table.

17:36.968 --> 17:37.926
Shivani.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.536
Uh, this is my cousin,

17:39.580 --> 17:40.624
Rosalinda.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.539
Sorry to crash
the family reunion.

17:42.583 --> 17:46.065
Um, the acquisition went
much faster than expected,

17:46.108 --> 17:49.677
and I couldn't pass up escargot.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.896
Liz, you're gonna love
the new gadgets

17:51.940 --> 17:53.289
we're gonna have
at our disposal.

17:53.333 --> 17:56.292
So, if Genoryx was like being
a kid in a candy shop,

17:56.336 --> 17:59.382
Shivani's R&D budget is like
the Wonka factory.

17:59.426 --> 18:02.168
Your research is what
I'm really excited about.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.605
I feel like the lucky one.

18:04.648 --> 18:08.348
Now, Liz tells me that
you're an artist.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.306
Tell me about your work.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.395
Um, well, right now
I'm really into

18:12.439 --> 18:13.918
this Mexican muralist
from the '30s.

18:13.962 --> 18:16.051
His name is David Siqueiros.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.618
He worked with fractals.

18:17.661 --> 18:22.188
They're, um, infinitely
repeating shrinking patterns.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.538
They are orderly,
but also have chaos.

18:24.581 --> 18:26.496
- Fractals?
- Yeah.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.107
The shape lends
itself to this...

18:28.150 --> 18:31.153
To increase volume
and surface ratio.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.589
On the canvas?

18:32.633 --> 18:34.287
Wait, so... we were looking

18:34.330 --> 18:36.158
for a way
to attack damaged tissue.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.768
Right?
Mm-hmm.

18:37.812 --> 18:39.509
Okay, but fractals,
they're all over the place.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.946
In cell physiology,
and in human anatomy.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.774
I mean, what if we used
that same pattern?

18:43.818 --> 18:47.778
We might be better able to
holistically mitigate damage.

18:47.822 --> 18:49.389
Not only that.

18:49.432 --> 18:51.042
We could regenerate
the cells altogether.

18:51.086 --> 18:53.958
I mean, you have this new
cryogenics company, right?

18:54.002 --> 18:55.960
An immersive chamber might be
exactly what we need

18:56.004 --> 18:59.442
to undo the damage
that has altered these cells.

18:59.486 --> 19:02.402
We could flood our subjects'
circulatory systems

19:02.445 --> 19:04.273
with bio-engineered
organic compounds

19:04.317 --> 19:07.146
that are in a cryogenic...

19:07.189 --> 19:09.670
Pod.

19:09.713 --> 19:12.760
Yeah, um, you guys sound like
you have a lot to catch up on

19:12.803 --> 19:14.240
in words that I
can't even spell,

19:14.283 --> 19:16.764
so I'm gonna catch you later.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.247
Hey.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.039
Jones is coming.

19:31.082 --> 19:33.737
Don't move. Don't make a sound.

19:41.789 --> 19:42.833
Listen...

19:44.095 --> 19:46.228
Where's the work you owe me?

19:46.272 --> 19:49.013
It's almost complete.
You'll have it soon.

19:49.057 --> 19:50.580
No, I'll have it now.

19:51.755 --> 19:54.410
Give me that little book
you're always scribbling in,

19:54.454 --> 19:55.672
your instructions.

19:55.716 --> 19:58.545
What good does
incomplete work do?

19:58.588 --> 20:00.938
Leave me to finish in peace
if you want me to

20:00.982 --> 20:02.201
provide you what you need.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.566
Killing you...

20:19.609 --> 20:21.916
isn't the only way
I can hurt you.

20:25.572 --> 20:28.531
Instructions. He-he means
the Bible, right?

20:28.575 --> 20:30.881
What if Jones found it?

20:30.925 --> 20:34.363
I think we have to jump forward
to find out.

20:42.893 --> 20:45.418
Wake up, son, we gotta go.
It's not safe here.

20:48.116 --> 20:50.553
You remember where we put
our special book and glasses?

20:50.597 --> 20:51.946
Mm.

20:51.989 --> 20:54.427
Then get 'em.

21:04.611 --> 21:07.614
What the hell is Bronson doing
with a gun on my dad?

21:10.965 --> 21:13.576
No!

21:13.620 --> 21:15.361
You killed my daddy!

21:15.404 --> 21:17.624
That's not your daddy, boy.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.417
We gotta get moving.
Come on.

21:35.468 --> 21:36.904
Are you okay?

21:42.997 --> 21:45.608
Iz, are you okay? I thought
I lost you for a second.

21:45.652 --> 21:47.436
Did you...
you see something, or...

21:47.480 --> 21:49.917
I don't know what I saw.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.790
Let's keep going.

22:04.018 --> 22:05.149
Don't keep them together

22:05.193 --> 22:06.760
in case Jones finds
your hiding spot.

22:06.803 --> 22:09.545
They'll be safe.
I promise.

22:09.589 --> 22:13.157
Keep this far away
from Roswell.

22:13.201 --> 22:15.508
I'll talk to the Valentis.

22:15.551 --> 22:16.987
Maybe they can take it south.

22:17.031 --> 22:19.338
I'm in your debt.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.340
You were right, man,
he targeted him.

22:22.515 --> 22:24.430
I have to hide my son.

22:25.822 --> 22:28.390
You said your boy is
talented with water.

22:29.609 --> 22:32.873
They say the lakes in the
national forests are bottomless.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.788
I doubt Jones'll
find 'em there.

22:34.831 --> 22:37.051
Yeah.

22:38.226 --> 22:40.489
Great. Okay, thank you.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.205
My brave boy.

23:01.249 --> 23:02.816
This isn't goodbye.

23:02.859 --> 23:04.948
You'll see me again.
I have faith.

23:04.992 --> 23:07.647
I'm going back
inside, aren't I?

23:07.690 --> 23:08.909
What if I forget?

23:10.998 --> 23:13.043
You won't forget.

23:13.087 --> 23:16.873
I've hidden your memories
to protect you.

23:16.917 --> 23:18.092
Don't be scared.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.618
This Bible will have
your instructions.

23:22.662 --> 23:24.794
The key to reading it

23:24.838 --> 23:27.188
will be in a secret spot
that only you will know.

23:28.755 --> 23:31.192
When the time comes,
you'll find your way to it.

23:31.235 --> 23:33.455
But where will you hide it?

23:42.943 --> 23:45.728
I know where to find
his glasses.

23:51.473 --> 23:54.563
Hey.

23:54.607 --> 23:57.348
Your work's evolved so much

23:57.392 --> 23:59.133
since you left Roswell.

24:01.178 --> 24:02.702
And so have you.

24:02.745 --> 24:05.966
I'm sorry I was so awful
at dinner.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.578
I-I want you to know
Shivani does not know

24:09.622 --> 24:11.101
about our secrets.

24:11.145 --> 24:13.103
That's not what
I'm worried about.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.149
That's not what I was
ever worried about.

24:15.192 --> 24:18.587
What I'm worried about is why
you came all this way

24:18.631 --> 24:20.937
just to brag about
some new friendship.

24:20.981 --> 24:24.593
I mean, that was the point
of all the shop talk

24:24.637 --> 24:25.942
over snails, right?

24:25.986 --> 24:27.640
It was to try
to make me feel small?

24:28.989 --> 24:31.165
Instead of toasting
your success,

24:31.208 --> 24:33.384
and celebrating Shivani's
interest in it

24:33.428 --> 24:35.212
and all that you had
to say about it,

24:35.256 --> 24:37.301
I was the one who felt small.

24:37.345 --> 24:40.479
So I overcompensated by
pulling the subject to science,

24:40.522 --> 24:42.524
like a total <i>bruja.</i>

24:42.568 --> 24:46.615
Liz, <i>que dices?</i>

24:46.659 --> 24:48.661
I still don't have it
all together.

24:48.704 --> 24:53.361
I just... released my
judgment on myself.

24:53.404 --> 24:57.408
Letting go of the expectation
of what life should be

24:57.452 --> 25:01.108
has freed me to create one
that actually is me.

25:02.675 --> 25:04.372
I'm completely impressed.

25:04.415 --> 25:07.375
My kitchen is a little small
for churro pancakes,

25:07.418 --> 25:10.117
but you can still tell me
what this is about.

25:11.292 --> 25:15.557
I've been trying to be
this perfectly supportive

25:15.601 --> 25:17.603
teacher and mentor
and girlfriend,

25:17.646 --> 25:19.735
and then Max, he...

25:19.779 --> 25:23.130
made a huge decision
without me,

25:23.173 --> 25:25.959
and now I feel lost.

25:27.961 --> 25:32.835
Well, Max is stubborn.
This is not news.

25:32.879 --> 25:34.794
But that is his journey.

25:34.837 --> 25:37.579
This, right now,
is about you.

25:38.798 --> 25:41.931
Liz Ortecho is allowed
to make mistakes.

25:41.975 --> 25:44.630
Just like everybody else.

25:45.805 --> 25:47.981
Just focus on what is
authentically you.

25:48.024 --> 25:49.939
And news flash,
it is not hatch parties

25:49.983 --> 25:51.680
or Mr. Feeny cosplay.

25:51.724 --> 25:56.250
Weird fringe science,
that's your jam.

25:57.643 --> 26:01.690
Just, the more that you
focus on

26:01.734 --> 26:03.779
being the most you,

26:03.823 --> 26:05.346
everything will fall into place.

26:09.611 --> 26:12.658
Why was this never registered
with the Chavez County clerk?

26:12.701 --> 26:14.834
That property is outside
of county lines.

26:14.877 --> 26:16.575
Bronson wanted it that way.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.272
So you own 13 acres of land,

26:18.315 --> 26:20.404
but you chose to live
in a junkyard?

26:20.448 --> 26:23.712
Yeah. I like being
near the liquor store.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.801
Bronson should have
never bought that land.

26:25.845 --> 26:28.587
He would have been happier
with a farm up near

26:28.630 --> 26:29.892
his favorite fishing hole.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.502
But that ugly real estate rule;

26:31.546 --> 26:32.808
they wouldn't let him buy it?

26:32.852 --> 26:35.768
Yeah. Yeah, he settled for
13 acres of land

26:35.811 --> 26:36.943
that wasn't even arable.

26:36.986 --> 26:38.509
Had a dried up aquifer,

26:38.553 --> 26:39.902
a couple underground caves.

26:39.946 --> 26:42.644
But as long as he had
Louise and the baby,

26:42.688 --> 26:44.298
he was happy.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.040
Sounds like the perfect place
to hide a spaceship.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.824
Yeah, this is right near
where the paint thinner

26:48.868 --> 26:50.347
was taken last night.

26:50.391 --> 26:52.262
Which means Tezca's probably
already on her way.

26:52.306 --> 26:53.612
I can follow up on this,

26:53.655 --> 26:54.787
but we can't let Clyde

26:54.830 --> 26:56.310
get anywhere
- near that craft.
- Mm.

26:56.353 --> 26:58.399
I'll-I'll distract him.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.186
It's okay, it's okay.
We're-we're fam.

27:04.318 --> 27:05.711
As you guys say.

27:13.806 --> 27:15.329
You okay?

27:17.157 --> 27:18.767
You know that once
you get those glasses,

27:18.811 --> 27:20.116
you'll be able to know
everything you want

27:20.160 --> 27:20.987
about your father.

27:21.030 --> 27:22.858
Iz, I don't know, what if--

27:22.902 --> 27:25.687
What if I fail him?

27:25.731 --> 27:27.471
I get that.

27:27.515 --> 27:30.997
After I got
my mother's sword, I was...

27:32.346 --> 27:34.391
I was terrified
of letting her down.

27:34.435 --> 27:36.916
Changes everything.

27:36.959 --> 27:39.788
But I do believe that when
we step into our legacy,

27:39.832 --> 27:42.748
it makes us stronger.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.509
Okay, damn! I mean,

28:48.552 --> 28:51.077
you just went all <i>
Ten Commandments</i> on that pond.

29:01.043 --> 29:03.524
All right, I was expecting
a little more Dallas

29:03.567 --> 29:04.699
and less sword

29:04.743 --> 29:06.222
on our quest to find
spaceship parts.

29:06.266 --> 29:07.920
Yeah, well, Dallas is
off chasing a lead

29:07.963 --> 29:09.051
on his father's work,

29:09.095 --> 29:12.185
and, um, as for
Señor Slicey here,

29:12.228 --> 29:14.404
well, how often have poked
around an unknown cave

29:14.448 --> 29:17.756
- and found something pleasant?
- Good point.

29:19.322 --> 29:22.543
Oh, tranq guns
for you and Michael. Smart.

29:22.586 --> 29:24.414
Oh, yeah. I wanted to talk
to you about Michael

29:24.458 --> 29:25.894
before he got here.
I think Clyde

29:25.938 --> 29:27.374
is selling him
on returning to Oasis.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.985
Well, he's been dreaming
about that place

29:30.029 --> 29:31.291
since he first caught
a glimpse of the sky

29:31.334 --> 29:32.683
the night he fell out
of the pod.

29:32.727 --> 29:35.077
Yeah, I know, but this is--

29:35.121 --> 29:36.905
This is more than fairy tales.

29:37.732 --> 29:40.126
I think the-the possibility
of returning home

29:40.169 --> 29:41.649
is clouding Michael's judgment.

29:41.692 --> 29:43.651
Got it. So it's like, um,

29:43.694 --> 29:46.219
the protector versus
the dreamer.

29:46.262 --> 29:48.134
Right, well, the dreamer
hid a map from us.

29:48.177 --> 29:51.224
Kind of like how you hid
giving up your powers from Liz?

29:52.225 --> 29:55.794
Look, Max, I know
you want to protect him.

29:55.837 --> 29:58.144
Of course you do.
You're his big brother.

29:58.187 --> 30:02.278
Maybe being his big brother
means being big enough

30:02.322 --> 30:05.804
to accept his adult decisions.

30:11.853 --> 30:13.115
What's with all the chitchat?

30:13.159 --> 30:14.595
Spaceship's not gonna
just find itself.

30:16.771 --> 30:19.600
Okay, what page...

30:21.863 --> 30:24.039
Let's give it a try.

30:29.871 --> 30:31.307
"A map where no roads go

30:31.351 --> 30:34.093
is where all roads lay hidden."

30:54.722 --> 30:55.941
Mom?

30:58.378 --> 31:01.685
Is that you?♪ You should have seen

31:01.729 --> 31:05.124
♪ The curse that flew
right by you ♪

31:16.831 --> 31:19.355
There's nothing in that passage
off to the left.

31:21.096 --> 31:23.098
Look. That's blood.

31:24.056 --> 31:26.580
Smell that? Acetone.

31:27.581 --> 31:29.626
It's gotta be Tezca.

31:39.071 --> 31:41.812
I'm curious.

31:41.856 --> 31:43.205
Did you get here
on your own,

31:43.249 --> 31:45.033
or did a
treacherous Oasian

31:45.077 --> 31:46.469
nudge you in
the right direction?

31:46.513 --> 31:48.732
This has nothing
to do with Bonnie.

31:48.776 --> 31:51.431
I'm not talking about
Little Miss Naiïveté.

31:51.474 --> 31:54.913
This feels like an ingrate
trying to assert his will

31:54.956 --> 31:56.044
while I'm in a weakened state.

31:56.088 --> 31:58.786
Rest assured, I'm not.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.266
Watch out!

32:02.790 --> 32:05.619
You still seem to be
without your powers.

32:05.662 --> 32:07.621
Don't need powers
to squeeze a trigger.

32:14.149 --> 32:16.325
Alone at last.

32:17.283 --> 32:18.632
I like your sword.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.940
Well, come and get it.

32:36.128 --> 32:39.044
I-I know you.
How do I know you?

32:40.741 --> 32:42.438
No matter.

32:42.482 --> 32:45.137
You'll know me as the last face
you ever saw.

33:02.458 --> 33:03.851
This seems to be the spot,

33:03.894 --> 33:05.244
but what danger
should I be concerned about?

33:07.855 --> 33:10.162
Okay...

33:27.744 --> 33:30.791
Great. Cosmic quicksand?

33:30.834 --> 33:34.142
Let's see what you hid in the
Gospel of Luke about this.

33:34.186 --> 33:37.015
I'm sorry we didn't
find the ship today.

33:37.058 --> 33:39.843
You know,
I was unsure about it

33:39.887 --> 33:42.063
for a bunch of stupid reasons.

33:42.107 --> 33:44.326
But, uh, but I know how much
it means to you.

33:44.370 --> 33:48.243
I'm sorry. I should have
told you about the map sooner.

33:49.592 --> 33:53.509
Kinda felt like, in order
to ponder the possibilities,

33:53.553 --> 33:55.903
I had to keep anyone
from weighing in

33:55.946 --> 33:57.165
on the harsh realities.

33:57.209 --> 33:58.688
By anyone, you mean me,
don't you?

33:58.732 --> 34:02.040
If the dream killer
shoes fit...

34:04.085 --> 34:05.739
You ever feel like
you got two paths,

34:05.782 --> 34:07.567
and they both seem right?

34:08.655 --> 34:11.136
Well, I think it's good that
you ponder the possibilities.

34:11.179 --> 34:15.053
I mean, I think I, uh,
should probably do

34:15.096 --> 34:16.880
a little more pondering,

34:16.924 --> 34:19.840
and spend a little less
time in protect mode.

34:21.233 --> 34:23.626
Okay, a lot less time.

34:24.410 --> 34:27.282
But, um, look,
whatever you decide,

34:27.326 --> 34:29.415
I got your back.

34:31.765 --> 34:33.549
Well, Tezca's still out.

34:33.593 --> 34:35.073
I don't think
she'll be very happy

34:35.116 --> 34:36.900
when she wakes up
locked up.

34:36.944 --> 34:39.947
You really think she was
your teacher of some sort?

34:39.990 --> 34:41.470
Yeah.

34:41.514 --> 34:44.473
Dallas' memories said as much,
and then I just had some

34:44.517 --> 34:45.779
triggered of my own, so...

34:45.822 --> 34:50.131
You know, Tezca said
Clyde was disloyal.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.698
He knew she was
gonna be there, right?

34:51.741 --> 34:54.266
Which means mission
accomplished; we divided them.

34:55.789 --> 34:59.140
Right, but if Clyde
really did play us,

34:59.184 --> 35:01.360
and Bonnie went
to distract him...

35:01.403 --> 35:02.796
I gotta warn her.

35:04.667 --> 35:07.366
Now, I know I've never enjoyed
these walks

35:07.409 --> 35:08.889
you're inclined to take,

35:08.932 --> 35:11.544
but it got me thinking today
about one's journey.

35:11.587 --> 35:15.591
They often start with
the guidance of another,

35:15.635 --> 35:18.942
but discoveries
eventually push one

35:18.986 --> 35:20.770
to forge their own path.

35:21.554 --> 35:23.599
<i>Mine led me to overhear</i> <i>
an interesting discussion</i>

35:23.643 --> 35:27.168
<i>about deeds and spacecraft.</i>

35:27.212 --> 35:30.302
There never was a
ship to be found.

35:30.345 --> 35:33.131
I'm certain your friends
found something compelling.

35:33.174 --> 35:37.135
You wanted them to find
that house Bronson bought.

35:37.178 --> 35:39.093
Is that where Tezca is?

35:39.137 --> 35:41.226
You sent them to their doom.

35:41.269 --> 35:43.445
Their death or hers,
such matters of fate

35:43.489 --> 35:44.446
are for Ophiuchus
to decide.

35:44.490 --> 35:45.578
The greater matter was

35:45.621 --> 35:47.057
hoping your new friends

35:47.101 --> 35:49.277
would find the actual
spot I was looking for.

35:49.321 --> 35:53.325
The one Tezca's been
so reticent to share with me.

35:53.368 --> 35:56.806
But as you pointed out,
streams of hope

35:56.850 --> 35:59.548
shine through the darkness
on this planet.

35:59.592 --> 36:01.463
That has nothing
to do with hope.

36:01.507 --> 36:02.508
Oh, on the contrary.

36:02.551 --> 36:04.988
<i>It's about never giving up</i>

36:05.032 --> 36:08.340
<i>on what you put your faith in.</i>

36:09.863 --> 36:14.563
It's about where the path
leads the righteous.

36:14.607 --> 36:16.696
And in case you were wondering,

36:16.739 --> 36:19.133
it led us here.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.656
Dallas, is it?

36:22.397 --> 36:24.965
Your journey has been
revelatory for us both.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.447
What are--
what are you talking about?

36:28.490 --> 36:31.319
Michael thought
I was after a ship.

36:31.363 --> 36:33.713
But I was looking for
something much smaller.

36:36.237 --> 36:39.240
Now, those glasses
and that Bible,

36:39.284 --> 36:41.111
they're the final pieces
in this puzzle.

36:41.155 --> 36:44.593
This is my father's work.
It's not meant for you.

36:44.637 --> 36:47.901
Ophiuchus presides over
what is meant or me, not you,

36:47.944 --> 36:48.902
nor the traitor Theo.

36:48.945 --> 36:50.817
Dallas, run!

36:50.860 --> 36:53.211
Do so and there are consequences.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.518
Toss the glasses
and the Bible over to me,

36:56.562 --> 36:58.433
- or she goes in.
- Okay, hold on. Hold on.

36:58.477 --> 36:59.869
Please don't do this.

36:59.913 --> 37:02.132
You want to make a deal
with me, right?

37:02.176 --> 37:03.699
♪ Will you follow....

37:03.743 --> 37:05.397
All right, well,
let her go first.

37:05.440 --> 37:08.487
If I let her go,
then what do I bargain with?

37:08.530 --> 37:10.663
Her fate is in your hands.

37:10.706 --> 37:13.274
♪ If you lose it all

37:13.318 --> 37:17.322
♪ Will it fall apart?

37:17.365 --> 37:19.889
♪ Will you follow me

37:19.933 --> 37:22.762
♪ Into the dark?

37:37.777 --> 37:38.734
I'm sorry.

37:38.778 --> 37:40.780
I'm sorry I frightened you.

37:42.782 --> 37:45.219
I never wanted it
to come to this.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.569
But you...

37:47.613 --> 37:51.181
you have always made me see

37:51.225 --> 37:53.401
that I must take
the hardest steps.

37:58.711 --> 37:59.973
DALLAS:Hey, what the hell
is wrong with you?

38:00.016 --> 38:01.975
Hey, I did what you asked.
Save her!

38:02.018 --> 38:05.326
You worry about her body.
I saved her soul!

38:05.370 --> 38:07.328
But what about your soul?

38:08.677 --> 38:11.593
Let me save you.
Forgive her and let her go.

38:11.637 --> 38:12.942
Do you think
you're strong enough

38:12.986 --> 38:14.204
to finish your journey?

38:14.248 --> 38:17.120
Reclaim your father's book,
save the innocent?

38:17.164 --> 38:19.514
Because you appear weak

38:19.558 --> 38:21.777
from wallowing in
this lesser world.

38:26.260 --> 38:28.480
Not bad, but not good enough.

38:32.179 --> 38:33.876
We can still be happy.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.704
That's what
you never understood.

38:35.748 --> 38:39.229
My purpose, it dwarfs
this notion of happiness.

38:39.273 --> 38:41.493
There is no greater actualization

38:41.536 --> 38:44.757
without sacrificing
what one loves.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.324
Hey!

38:46.367 --> 38:47.847
All right, look,
whatever your problem is

38:47.890 --> 38:50.371
with me and my father,
it's got nothing to do with her.

38:51.546 --> 38:52.982
Okay, so pull her out.

38:53.026 --> 38:55.420
She'll pay for what she did
against the cause.

38:58.988 --> 39:01.034
You're insane.

39:01.077 --> 39:02.557
This isn't over.

39:02.601 --> 39:05.430
Given I now have the means
to finish what my savior

39:05.473 --> 39:07.780
asked to be built...

39:07.823 --> 39:12.480
for you and the rest of
your disruptive friends,

39:12.524 --> 39:14.352
I think it is.

39:23.491 --> 39:27.408
Uh, the back door will lock
behind you when you're done.

39:27.452 --> 39:28.670
Thanks, Javier.

39:28.714 --> 39:30.368
Good night.
Good night.

39:37.287 --> 39:38.724
Nope!

39:38.767 --> 39:42.292
No, I'm not reading into it.
It could be anything.

39:42.336 --> 39:44.512
A faulty wire.

39:44.556 --> 39:47.515
A rat hitting the...

39:47.559 --> 39:48.995
It better not be a rat.

39:49.038 --> 39:51.127
What are you doing here?

39:51.171 --> 39:53.521
Oh, hey!

39:53.565 --> 39:55.567
Thank God it's you.

39:57.917 --> 40:01.660
The, uh, bane of my existence,
otherwise known as bookkeeping.

40:01.703 --> 40:04.402
I couldn't focus at The Pony.
Long story.

40:04.445 --> 40:06.012
Well, I just got back
from New York

40:06.055 --> 40:07.535
with an idea that
might cure Michael.

40:07.579 --> 40:08.884
Figured I'd scoop up
some carbs,

40:08.928 --> 40:10.059
and then head to the lab.

40:10.103 --> 40:11.887
You have got your
priorities in order.

40:11.931 --> 40:14.455
- Don't forget your milkshake.
- Oh.

40:14.499 --> 40:15.891
I didn't make that.

40:21.810 --> 40:24.987
That's weird Javier
left this like this.

40:27.816 --> 40:31.037
Weirder still that it's
Bananas Foster's Ranch.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.647
Every time we try
to pull it off the menu,

40:32.691 --> 40:34.736
Alex begs us not to.

40:36.216 --> 40:37.478
Hey, what's wrong?

40:37.522 --> 40:40.873
Oh, my God. It's Alex.

40:42.570 --> 40:44.833
Whoa. What is
going on, Maria?

40:44.877 --> 40:47.619
Okay, all right,
my mom's chicken dumpling soup

40:47.662 --> 40:49.229
is Alex's favorite.

40:49.272 --> 40:52.798
And the feather floating
in the air: Alex is an airman.

40:52.841 --> 40:56.715
The song that played
at The Pony was Mars Volta.

40:57.846 --> 40:59.413
Mars Volta's the first concert

40:59.457 --> 41:00.936
you, Alex and I ever went to.

41:00.980 --> 41:03.504
This whole time, I thought
it was my mom haunting me.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.245
It was Alex.

41:05.288 --> 41:07.987
But if it's Alex...

41:09.510 --> 41:11.164
Does that mean he's dead, too?

41:42.412 --> 41:44.240
It's good to see you, son.

41:45.981 --> 41:47.983
Your journey is just beginning.
