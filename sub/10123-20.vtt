00:01.834 --> 00:03.934
GOOD MORNING, CLASS.

00:03.934 --> 00:07.033
I WOULD LIKE YOU ALL
TO LET OUT

00:07.033 --> 00:09.233
YOUR MOST AGONIZED GROAN.

00:09.233 --> 00:10.667
All: AW...

00:10.667 --> 00:14.100
GOOD.
NOW, LET'S START PLANNING

00:14.100 --> 00:15.967
OUR SPRINGTIME CLASS PLAY.

00:15.967 --> 00:18.734
All: OHH!

00:20.200 --> 00:21.567
BEEN THERE, HEARD THAT.

00:21.567 --> 00:24.567
NOW, BEFORE YOU GIVE UP
IN DESPAIR,

00:24.567 --> 00:28.200
YOU MAY WANT TO HEAR
MY PLAY SELECTION.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.133
IT HAS SWORD FIGHTS...

00:30.133 --> 00:33.000
MURDER, SKULLS...

00:33.000 --> 00:34.400
EVEN GHOSTS.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.233
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?

00:36.233 --> 00:39.100
SOUNDS LIKE
SPIELBERG.

00:39.100 --> 00:41.033
SOUNDS LIKE SHAKESPEARE.

00:41.033 --> 00:43.000
SOUNDS LIKE A LOSER.

00:44.233 --> 00:45.500
WE WILL BE DOING
SELECTED SCENES

00:45.500 --> 00:47.500
FROM THE PLAY<i>HAMLET.</i>

00:47.500 --> 00:51.133
MR. HUNTER, IN THE PARLANCE
OF THE THEATER,

00:51.133 --> 00:53.500
YOU WILL BE A SPEAR CARRIER.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.233
EXCELLENT.
SO THIS GUY I PLAY

00:56.233 --> 00:59.300
IS LIKE, WHAT,
A WARRIOR AND A HERO?

00:59.300 --> 01:00.700
NO. THIS GUY YOU PLAY

01:00.700 --> 01:03.934
HAS VERY FEW LINES
TO MEMORIZE.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.567
MISS LAWRENCE,
YOU WILL BE PLAYING

01:08.567 --> 01:10.500
THE TRAGIC HEROINE OPHELIA.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.033
NOW, THIS IS
A CHALLENGING ROLE.

01:13.033 --> 01:15.200
SHE GOES QUITE INSANE.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.467
TOPANGA INSANE?
WHAT A STRETCH.

01:18.467 --> 01:20.600
IF I WERE
A LESS-EVOLVED PERSON,

01:20.600 --> 01:22.934
I'D SAY CRAM IT,
BRILLO-HEAD.

01:24.467 --> 01:27.200
MR. MINKUS, YOU WILL BE
PLAYING THE ROLE

01:27.200 --> 01:29.367
OF THE WISE OLD POLONIUS.

01:29.367 --> 01:33.400
POLONIUS?
HE ONLY HAS 48 LINES.

01:33.400 --> 01:38.867
I SORT OF PICTURED MYSELF
AS THE MELANCHOLY DANE.

01:38.867 --> 01:41.767
FOR THOSE OF YOU UNFAMILIAR
WITH THE REFERENCE,

01:41.767 --> 01:45.400
MR. MINKUS MEANS THE LEAD
ROLE, PRINCE HAMLET.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.500
NOW, THIS IS A TRICKY PART
TO CAST,

01:47.500 --> 01:51.500
BECAUSE HAMLET GETS ON
A LOT OF PEOPLE'S NERVES.

01:51.500 --> 01:54.567
HE MAKES ONE STUPID MISTAKE
AFTER ANOTHER,

01:54.567 --> 01:57.834
AND FOR 5 ACTS
HE NEVER SHUTS UP.

02:04.300 --> 02:06.834
WHAT, DO I HAVE
A BOOGER?

02:11.567 --> 02:13.967
[THEME MUSIC]

03:11.100 --> 03:14.967
CORY, I DON'T WANT
TO BE A WINDMILL ANYMORE.

03:14.967 --> 03:17.033
MORGAN, YOU HAVE
TO WORK WITH ME.

03:17.033 --> 03:18.200
I'M NOT GOING
TO BE HUMILIATED AGAIN

03:18.200 --> 03:20.500
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE
ON THE JERSEY SHORE.

03:20.500 --> 03:24.133
YOU AND DAD ARE GOING
TO GET YOUR BUTTS KICKED.

03:24.133 --> 03:28.600
NOT THIS YEAR. MOM AND ERIC'S
WINNING STREAK IS OVER.

03:31.734 --> 03:33.800
OVER THERE?

03:39.100 --> 03:40.934
HEY, COR,
CAN I BORROW SOME CASH?

03:40.934 --> 03:42.934
YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH THE JOB.

03:42.934 --> 03:44.133
I'M ALLOWANCE BOY.

03:44.133 --> 03:46.200
THEY CUT OUR SALARIES
5% AT THE MARKET.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.033
NOW, LOOK, I COULD HAVE GONE
TO ANYBODY FOR CASH,

03:48.033 --> 03:49.400
BUT I CAME TO YOU
BECAUSE WE'RE FAMILY.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.600
I MEAN,
WE'RE LIKE BROTHERS.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.934
YOU'RE THE CLOSEST PERSON
IN THE WORLD TO ME, COR.

03:55.934 --> 03:58.300
AND YOUR NAME IS...

03:58.300 --> 04:02.133
ALL RIGHT, LOOK. FOR 5 BUCKS,
AND YOU NEVER TELL MOM,

04:02.133 --> 04:05.033
I'LL THROW THE GOOFY GOLF
TOURNAMENT THIS YEAR.

04:05.033 --> 04:07.100
HEY, DAD AND I
DON'T NEED YOU GUYS

04:07.100 --> 04:09.100
TO TAKE A DIVE
FOR US TO WIN.

04:09.100 --> 04:10.800
AHEM.

04:16.967 --> 04:18.600
YEAH, YOU DO.

04:22.300 --> 04:26.400
"TO BE OR NOT TO BE,
THAT IS THE QUESTION.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.400
"WHETHER 'TIS NOBLER
IN THE MIND

04:28.400 --> 04:30.500
"TO SUFFER

BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH.

04:33.400 --> 04:37.000
MR. FEENY,
WHO WROTE THIS GARBAGE?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.300
SOME SAY
SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS

04:38.300 --> 04:40.400
WERE WRITTEN BY
A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS,

04:40.400 --> 04:42.934
BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY
BELIEVE THAT.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.200
I PERSONALLY
SUBSCRIBE

04:44.200 --> 04:45.467
TO THE FRANCIS
BACON THEORY.

04:45.467 --> 04:49.400
I GO WITH THE JIMMY DEAN
SAUSAGE THEORY.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.934
PLEASE CONTINUE,
MR. MATTHEWS.

04:51.934 --> 04:53.100
OK.

04:53.100 --> 04:56.300
"TO DIE, TO SLEEP--NO MORE.

04:56.300 --> 05:00.133
AND BY A SLEEP TO SAY
WE END THE HEARTACHE."

05:00.133 --> 05:01.400
CAN I PLEASE STOP WHINING

05:01.400 --> 05:04.300
AND SHOVE A SWORD
THROUGH SOMEBODY'S GUTS?

05:04.300 --> 05:06.300
YES, AS SOON
AS YOU GET

05:06.300 --> 05:08.000
TO THE QUEEN'S
CHAMBER.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.033
SEE, THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM
RIGHT THERE.

05:11.033 --> 05:13.133
YOU WANT MURDER,
YOU WANT SUSPENSE,

05:13.133 --> 05:15.767
YOU DON'T GO
TO YOUR MOTHER'S BEDROOM.

05:19.133 --> 05:21.400
AND HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO IMPROVE

05:21.400 --> 05:23.467
THE GREATEST PLAY
IN ENGLISH LITERATURE?

05:23.467 --> 05:26.233
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
LET'S SET THIS THING

05:26.233 --> 05:27.500
IN A BURNING SKYSCRAPER.

05:27.500 --> 05:30.367
THEN I COULD DO SORT OF
A BRUCE WILLIS THING, YOU KNOW?

05:30.367 --> 05:32.300
SHOOTING UZIS,
BLOWING AWAY TERRORISTS,

05:32.300 --> 05:34.200
JUMPING OUT WINDOWS.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.400
ALL THIS GUY HAMLET DOES
IS TALK.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.867
HE EVEN TALKS
WHEN NOBODY'S THERE.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.000
PRINCE HAMLET FINDS
HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE

05:44.000 --> 05:45.100
OF A TERRIBLE
DILEMMA.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.300
WHATEVER COURSE
OF ACTION HE CHOOSES

05:47.300 --> 05:50.200
COULD HAVE
DIRE CONSEQUENCES.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.200
HE IS RACKED
WITH INDECISION.

05:52.200 --> 05:56.500
HE IS ONE OF LITERATURE'S
MOST HUMAN CHARACTERS.

05:56.500 --> 05:59.133
YOU MEAN MOST WIMPY
CHARACTERS.

05:59.133 --> 06:00.567
WIMPS TALK,
HEROES DO STUFF.

06:00.567 --> 06:05.200
THE GOSPEL ACCORDING
TO JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME.

06:05.200 --> 06:09.133
AH, OPHELIA,
DON'T YOU LOOK AUTHENTIC.

06:09.133 --> 06:12.133
THANK YOU, MR. FEENY.
HERE'S YOUR COSTUME.

06:12.133 --> 06:14.233
JEDIDIAH SEWED IT
LAST NIGHT.

06:14.233 --> 06:16.300
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT
WAS YOUR DAD THINKING?

06:16.300 --> 06:19.500
THIS IS A MINIDRESS
AND PANTYHOSE.

06:19.500 --> 06:23.367
NO, NO. ACTUALLY THIS IS
A DOUBLET AND TIGHTS,

06:23.367 --> 06:26.000
WHICH IS HOW
MALE ACTORS DRESSED

06:26.000 --> 06:27.400
BACK IN THE 1600s, SEE?

06:27.400 --> 06:29.400
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IF
HAMLET HAD WORN PANTS,

06:29.400 --> 06:32.000
HE COULD HAVE MADE
A DECISION OR TWO.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.500
IS THAT A SEXIST COMMENT?

06:33.500 --> 06:35.700
THAT'S WHAT I WAS
SHOOTING FOR.

06:35.700 --> 06:39.967
DON'T LISTEN TO HER, COR.
HER DAD SEWS.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.100
NOW, LISTEN.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.233
PART OF THIS ASSIGNMENT

06:43.233 --> 06:45.467
IS TO LEARN
THE CLASSICAL STYLE.

06:45.467 --> 06:48.300
SO DOING THE PLAY
IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM

06:48.300 --> 06:50.934
WILL HELP WITH THE LESSON.
HERE.

06:50.934 --> 06:51.500
OK, MR. FEENY,

06:51.500 --> 06:53.367
YOU DON'T WANT
TO LISTEN TO MY IDEAS,

06:53.367 --> 06:54.400
THE KIND OF IDEAS

06:54.400 --> 06:56.400
THAT COULD MAKE
THIS PLAY FAMOUS, FINE.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.500
BUT DON'T EXPECT ME

06:57.500 --> 06:59.400
TO SIT AROUND LIKE
HAMLET DID AND TAKE IT.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.000
OH, AND WHAT DO YOU
PROPOSE TO DO?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.767
I QUITTETH.

07:09.133 --> 07:11.467

FROM MATTHEWS,

07:11.467 --> 07:13.200

07:16.467 --> 07:18.200
YOU THINK HE'LL GIVE IN?

07:18.200 --> 07:19.400
WHAT CHOICE
DOES HE HAVE?

07:19.400 --> 07:21.400
WITHOUT ME, HE'LL HAVE
TO CANCEL THE PLAY.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.300
IT'S LESS
THAN A WEEK AWAY.

07:23.300 --> 07:24.500
I MEAN, WHO ELSE
IS HE GOING TO FIND

07:24.500 --> 07:27.300
WHO HAS MY,
DARE I SAY, CHARISMA?

07:27.300 --> 07:31.033
YEAH, THAT AND NO ONE ELSE
KNOWS ALL THE LINES.

07:31.033 --> 07:32.967
NOW I AM ALONE.

07:34.567 --> 07:39.000
OH, WHAT A ROGUE
AND PEASANT SLAVE AM I?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.500

07:40.500 --> 07:42.200
THOU SPEAKETH TRUE.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.667

OUR TROPHY ON THE SHELF.

HAS BEEN CANCELED.

ABOUT? DAD'S THE BOSS.

ABOUT US NOT GOING

THIS PAY CUT THING NOW?

09:04.300 --> 09:07.500

MY DECISION.

DECISION WAS IT?

WERE THE MANAGER.

EITHER.

WELL, DAD, I THINK

09:40.600 --> 09:41.800
YOU SHOULD GO IN THERE
AND TALK TO THEM,

09:41.800 --> 09:43.800
AND IF THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT
YOUR WAY, THEN JUST QUIT.

DO YOU THINK OF ME
AS A SPEAR CARRIER?

10:06.600 --> 10:11.367

TO RAISING A 12-YEAR-OLD

10:11.367 --> 10:13.600
IS IGNORE HIM.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.834
CAN I IGNORE
THE PEOPLE AT WORK?

WITH HIS SPEAR.

10:23.667 --> 10:26.567
GEE, I THOUGHT THE SPEARS
WERE ON AISLE 5.

10:26.567 --> 10:29.834
I MOVED THEM NEXT TO
THE SLINGS AND THE ARROWS.

10:29.834 --> 10:31.600

I REALLY THINK

DO SOMETHING HERE.

TO TALK TO BOB WILLIAMS?

10:39.834 --> 10:41.934
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO,

10:41.934 --> 10:43.767
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY.

10:43.767 --> 10:45.867
AND NEITHER DO YOU.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

10:45.867 --> 10:47.467
YOU DON'T THINK I CAN
CONTROL MY TEMPER

HE'D LIKE TO SAY TO YOU.

10:57.667 --> 11:00.100
BOB HAS LESS HAIR.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.233
TALK TO THE MAN.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.300
BOB...

11:08.133 --> 11:09.400
BOB.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.734
BOB, I'VE GOT
150 PEOPLE

11:13.734 --> 11:14.734
WHO ARE WORKING
VERY HARD

11:14.734 --> 11:17.300
AND BEING SQUEEZED
VERY TIGHT

11:17.300 --> 11:18.400
BY THIS ROLLBACK,

11:18.400 --> 11:20.567
AND MY STORE
IS OUTPERFORMING

11:20.567 --> 11:21.600
ALL THE OTHER
MARKET GIANTS

11:21.600 --> 11:23.367
IN THE GREATER
PHILADELPHIA AREA,

11:23.367 --> 11:24.567
AND I FEEL
THAT THIS ROLLBACK

11:24.567 --> 11:27.200
IS NEITHER WARRANTED
NOR FAIR.

11:28.367 --> 11:31.767
CALM, SUCCINCT, RATIONAL.

11:31.767 --> 11:35.700
GEE, I'M JUST NOT
ATTRACTED TO YOU ANYMORE.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.233
GOOD NIGHT, SWEETIE.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.400
GOOD NIGHT, BOB.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.000
[HIGH VOICE]
GOOD NIGHT, GOOD-LOOKING.

11:45.934 --> 11:50.200
NOW THAT
I'VE GOT YOU ALONE...

11:50.200 --> 11:51.200
BOB...

11:52.500 --> 11:53.734
LET ME SHOW YOU

11:53.734 --> 11:56.400
WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO DO WITH YOUR HEAD.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.200
NOW, MY WIFE
WOULD CALL THAT CRANKY.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.233
HAIL, CORIUS.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.934
WHERE'S YOUR SPEAR?

12:13.934 --> 12:16.567
I'VE GOT GUYS
TO CARRY MY SPEAR.

12:16.567 --> 12:17.100
SINCE WHEN?

12:17.100 --> 12:18.100
SINCE YOU LEFT THE PLAY,

12:18.100 --> 12:19.867
AND FEENY SHIFTED
ALL THE ROLES AROUND.

12:19.867 --> 12:22.834
I GOT BUMPED UP
TO POLONIUS.

12:22.834 --> 12:26.100
YOU LOOK MORE
LIKE A BALONIUS.

12:26.100 --> 12:27.233
YEAH, HE'S KIND OF
A FAT GUY,

12:27.233 --> 12:28.900
AND THERE'S A LOT
OF LINES TO MEMORIZE,

12:28.900 --> 12:30.767
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S
REALLY COOL ABOUT HIM?

12:30.767 --> 12:34.734
WHAT?
ACT III, SCENE 4.

12:34.734 --> 12:38.000
HUH-AAH! UHH!

12:38.000 --> 12:40.934
[GROANING]

12:40.934 --> 12:43.900
HUH-UHH!

12:43.900 --> 12:44.867
HUHH!

12:47.834 --> 12:49.233
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:49.233 --> 12:52.200
YOU DIE PRETTY
REALISTICALLY.

12:52.200 --> 12:56.200
YEAH. FEENY SAYS IT'S HIS
FAVORITE PART OF THE PLAY.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.967
YEAH, SO YOU'RE REALLY
GETTING INTO IT.

12:58.967 --> 13:01.600
HOW'S MINKUS DOING
IN MY PART?

13:01.600 --> 13:03.700
GOOD. GOOD.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.300
REALLY STINKING BAD.

13:05.300 --> 13:08.100
HE'S KILLING US, CORY.
YOU GOT TO COME BACK.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.000
HEY,
IF FEENY BACKS DOWN

13:10.000 --> 13:11.300
ON THE BALLERINA
OUTFIT, I'M THERE.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.867
HE'S NOT GOING
TO BACK DOWN,

13:13.867 --> 13:15.100
AND MINKUS
IS STINKING UP MY PLAY.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.200
WELL, I'M NOT
CRAWLING BACK TO FEENY.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.100
CORY, I'M ASKING YOU
A FAVOR.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.967
SHAWN, YESTERDAY,

13:20.967 --> 13:22.367
YOU WORSHIPPED ME
AS A GOD FOR QUITTING.

13:22.367 --> 13:24.967
IF THE PLAY'S SO BAD,
THEN WHY DON'T YOU QUIT?

13:24.967 --> 13:27.200
I CAN'T. TOO MANY PEOPLE
ARE DEPENDING ON ME.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.900
WHO'S DEPENDING ON YOU?

13:28.900 --> 13:31.133
MY DAD. HE'S COMING
TO SEE THE PLAY.

13:31.133 --> 13:33.867
YOUR DAD'S TAKING
TIME OFF WORK

13:33.867 --> 13:35.000
TO WATCH YOU DIE?

13:35.000 --> 13:38.934
APPARENTLY THIS IS SOMETHING
EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE.

13:38.934 --> 13:40.100
YOU KNOW WHAT
I WANT TO SEE?

13:40.100 --> 13:43.133
YOU AND ME SHOOTING HOOPS
IN THE GYM RIGHT NOW.

13:43.133 --> 13:45.033
I CAN'T, CORY.
I GOT REHEARSAL.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.934
HEY, GUYS. WAIT UP.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.100
THEY DISOBEY ME
LIKE THAT AGAIN,

13:52.100 --> 13:53.700
I'M GOING
TO SIT ON THEM.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.233
WHAT IS HE

14:04.233 --> 14:09.967
WHOSE GRIEF BEARS
SUCH AN EMPHASIS?

14:09.967 --> 14:12.100
STOP, MR. MINKUS.

14:12.100 --> 14:14.934
I ANSWER ONLY TO HAMLET.

14:14.934 --> 14:17.500
STOP, MR. HAMLET.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.100
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
FACING THE AUDIENCE.

14:21.100 --> 14:22.700
AREN'T I?

14:23.900 --> 14:25.467
HAMLET,
WHERE ARE YOUR GLASSES?

14:25.467 --> 14:28.100
MR. FEENY, THEY DIDN'T
HAVE EYEGLASSES

14:28.100 --> 14:29.834
IN THE MIDDLE AGES.

14:29.834 --> 14:31.100
PUT ON YOUR GLASSES

14:31.100 --> 14:32.934
AND CLIMB INTO
OPHELIA'S GRAVE.

14:32.934 --> 14:34.967
YOU KNOW, I READ AN ARTICLE

14:34.967 --> 14:36.133
THAT ELIZABETHAN ENGLISH

14:36.133 --> 14:38.100
IS A LOT LIKE
AMERICAN SOUTHERN,

14:38.100 --> 14:39.400
SO LET ME SHOW YOU
A LITTLE SOMETHING

14:39.400 --> 14:41.567
I'VE BEEN
PLAYING AROUND WITH.

14:42.300 --> 14:44.567
[HILLBILLY ACCENT]
SHAZAM!

14:46.867 --> 14:48.667
SHOW ME WHAT THOU'T DO.

14:49.967 --> 14:52.000
WOO'T WEEP?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.200
WOO'T FIGHT?

14:53.200 --> 14:55.767
WOO'T TEAR THYSELF?

14:56.467 --> 15:00.066
OH, GREAT. ERNEST
GOES TO DENMARK.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.967
STUART, I CAN'T BREATHE.

15:03.967 --> 15:04.967
STICK TO THE SCRIPT.

15:04.967 --> 15:06.800
YOUR FOOT IS ON MY LIVER.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.100
I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS.

15:11.100 --> 15:13.233
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF REHEARSAL.

15:13.233 --> 15:15.100
I WANT YOU ALL
TO GO HOME.

15:15.100 --> 15:18.867
HEY, LOOKS LIKE WE CAN
SHOOT HOOPS AFTER ALL.

15:18.867 --> 15:20.834
YEAH, LET ME JUST GO
PARK MY GUT

15:20.834 --> 15:21.900
IN THE WARDROBE ROOM.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.200
SO, HOW'S
THE PLAY GOING?

15:29.200 --> 15:32.133
WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE,
VERY POORLY.

15:32.133 --> 15:34.200
YOU KNOW, WHEN I QUIT
THIS THING,

15:34.200 --> 15:36.867
I DIDN'T THINK THAT EVERYONE
WOULD BE SO AFFECTED.

15:36.867 --> 15:39.133
NEITHER DID I.

15:39.133 --> 15:40.500
OK, MR. FEENY,

15:40.500 --> 15:43.033
I'M STILL NOT BIG
ON THE PANTYHOSE IDEA,

15:43.033 --> 15:44.300
BUT IF THAT'S
WHAT IT TAKES,

15:44.300 --> 15:46.300
YOU GOT
YOUR HAMLET BACK.

15:46.300 --> 15:49.600
MR. MATTHEWS, COME HERE.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.300
I ALREADY HAVE MY HAMLET.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.100
HE MAY BUMP
INTO THE SCENERY,

15:56.100 --> 15:59.000
HE MAY TALK
LIKE A HAYSEED...

15:59.000 --> 16:00.500
FOR ALL I KNOW,

16:00.500 --> 16:03.867
TOMORROW HE MAY SHOW UP
IN KABUKI MAKEUP.

16:05.967 --> 16:08.200
NEVERTHELESS,
HE IS MY HAMLET.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.300
I DO, HOWEVER,

16:09.300 --> 16:12.133
HAVE AN OPENING
FOR A SPEAR CARRIER.

16:12.133 --> 16:14.000
SPEAR CARRIER?

16:14.000 --> 16:16.867
THERE'S AN OLD
THEATER EXPRESSION--

16:16.867 --> 16:18.934
THERE ARE NO SMALL PARTS,

16:18.934 --> 16:20.834
ONLY SMALL ACTORS.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.233
YOU KNOW, MR. FEENY,

16:23.233 --> 16:24.500
MAYBE I WOULDN'T HAVE
BAILED ON THIS PLAY

16:24.500 --> 16:27.100
IF YOU PICKED SOMETHING
A LITTLE COOLER.

16:27.100 --> 16:29.033
I MEAN, COULDN'T WE DO
SELECTED SCENES

16:29.033 --> 16:30.734
FROM<i>THE TERMINATOR?</i>

16:32.300 --> 16:35.600
OR HOW ABOUT
A STEVEN SEAGAL SOLILOQUY?

16:35.600 --> 16:39.400
YOU KNOW, MR. MATTHEWS,
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.200
SHAKESPEARE IS DRY,
TEDIOUS,

16:42.200 --> 16:46.033
AND THERE'S NO WAY
FOR A PERSON YOUR AGE

16:46.033 --> 16:48.033
TO BE AFFECTED BY IT.

16:52.500 --> 16:56.200
I AM THY FATHER'S SPIRIT...

16:56.200 --> 16:59.934
DOOMED FOR A CERTAIN TERM

16:59.934 --> 17:01.967
TO WALK THE NIGHT,

17:01.967 --> 17:05.033
AND FOR THE DAY CONFINED

17:05.033 --> 17:07.200
TO FAST IN FIRES

17:07.200 --> 17:09.233
TILL THE FOUL CRIMES DONE

17:09.233 --> 17:11.467
IN MY DAYS OF NATURE

17:11.467 --> 17:15.700
ARE BURNED AND PURGED AWAY.

17:18.367 --> 17:20.934
BUT THAT I AM FORBID
TO TELL THE SECRETS

17:20.934 --> 17:22.000
OF MY PRISON HOUSE,

17:22.000 --> 17:23.600
I COULD A TALE UNFOLD

17:23.600 --> 17:28.200
WHOSE LIGHTEST WORD
WOULD HARROW UP THY SOUL,

17:28.200 --> 17:31.700
FREEZE THY YOUNG BLOOD...

17:32.934 --> 17:34.600
BUT THIS ETERNAL BLAZON

17:34.600 --> 17:40.200
MUST NOT BE TO EARS
OF FLESH AND BLOOD.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.867
LIST!

17:41.867 --> 17:43.800
LIST!

17:45.033 --> 17:46.300
OH, LIST.

17:46.300 --> 17:49.300
IF THOU DIDST EVER

17:49.300 --> 17:52.033
THY DEAR FATHER LOVE...

17:52.033 --> 17:54.200
OH, GOD.

17:54.200 --> 18:00.066
REVENGE HIS FOUL
AND MOST UNNATURAL MURDER.

18:00.066 --> 18:02.100
MURDER?

18:04.100 --> 18:07.834
OF COURSE,
I'M NO STEVEN SEAGAL.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.700
DAD!
OH, IT'S JUST YOU.

18:14.700 --> 18:17.667
MOM, YOU WASTED A PERFECTLY
GOOD BIRTH ON THIS?

18:17.667 --> 18:21.000
DAD'S SUPPOSED TO BE HOME
FROM HIS MEETING BY NOW.

18:21.000 --> 18:21.567
WHAT MEETING?

18:21.567 --> 18:23.200
YOUR DAD
WENT DOWN TO TALK

18:23.200 --> 18:24.200
TO
THE REGIONAL MANAGER

18:24.200 --> 18:25.467
ABOUT THAT
SALARY ROLLBACK.

18:25.467 --> 18:28.033
WHAT?
WHY DID HE DO THAT?

18:28.033 --> 18:29.567
MOM, HE COULD LOSE HIS JOB.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.600
THEY COULD BUST HIM DOWN
TO BOX BOY.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.100
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED HIM
TO TALK TO HIS BOSS.

18:34.100 --> 18:35.467
OH, WAY TO GO, CORY.
IF DAD GETS FIRED,

18:35.467 --> 18:38.233
THEY'RE NEVER GOING
TO KEEP ME ON.

18:38.233 --> 18:41.300
YOU'VE DESTROYED
THE WHOLE FAMILY.

18:41.300 --> 18:44.200
I GOT TO GO DOWN
TO THE STORE AND STOP HIM.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.400
DAD!

18:45.400 --> 18:47.467
YOU DIDN'T YELL
AT YOUR BOSS, DID YOU?

18:47.467 --> 18:50.500
WHY WOULD ANYONE THINK
I WAS GOING TO YELL?

18:50.500 --> 18:52.400
HEY, I'M THE ONE WHO FOUND
BOB WILLIAMS' HEAD

18:52.400 --> 18:56.233
SPLATTERED ALL OVER
THE KITCHEN FLOOR.

18:56.233 --> 18:58.100
DID YOU GET MY 5% BACK?

18:58.100 --> 18:59.300
NO, ERIC. I DIDN'T.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.600
I'M GOING TO CANCEL
5% OF MY DATES.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.233
YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW,
I HAD A VERY GOOD TALK

19:02.233 --> 19:03.300
WITH BOB WILLIAMS,

19:03.300 --> 19:05.100
AND BOB IS VERY CLEAR
ON MY POINT--

19:05.100 --> 19:07.300
I'M TALKING TO NOBODY.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.700
SO, HOW DID IT GO?

19:08.700 --> 19:11.400
IT WAS NOT THE EASIEST
MEETING I'VE EVER HAD.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.967
DAD, YOU DIDN'T QUIT,
DID YOU?

19:13.967 --> 19:15.300
NO, I DIDN'T.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.467
I WAS TEMPTED,
BUT I DIDN'T.

19:17.467 --> 19:20.467
I GUESS YOU COULDN'T, HUH?
I MEAN, WITH ME AND MOM

19:20.467 --> 19:22.767
AND THE REST OF THE FAMILY
COUNTING ON YOU.

19:22.767 --> 19:25.400
NO. I DIDN'T WANT
TO LET YOU GUYS DOWN.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.567
WISH I'D FIGURED THAT OUT
A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.367
I DID LET
ALL MY GUYS DOWN.

19:30.367 --> 19:32.200
YOU MEAN WHEN
YOU QUIT YOUR PLAY?

19:32.200 --> 19:35.200
YEAH. YOU KNOW, BEING
THE LEAD IN THE PLAY

19:35.200 --> 19:37.100
IS A LOT LIKE
BEING THE DAD.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.233
EXCUSE ME?

19:38.233 --> 19:40.600
OK, SO IT'S NOT,
BUT STILL...

19:40.600 --> 19:43.200
IF YOU MAKE
A SELFISH MISTAKE,

19:43.200 --> 19:44.500
THE PEOPLE WHO COUNT
ON YOU GET HURT.

19:44.500 --> 19:45.500
WELL, MAYBE MR. FEENY

19:45.500 --> 19:47.567
WOULD LET YOU BACK
IN THE PLAY.

19:47.567 --> 19:50.467
WELL, HE DID OFFER ME
A SMALLER PART.

19:50.467 --> 19:53.400
THE BAD NEWS IS I'D STILL
HAVE TO WEAR THE PANTYHOSE.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.834
BUT NOBODY LAUGHS AT A GUY
CARRYING A BIG SPEAR.

19:57.567 --> 20:01.200
OH, GOOD! DADDY'S HERE!
WE CAN START!

20:01.200 --> 20:03.200
NOT YET, MORGAN.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.200
START WHAT?

20:04.200 --> 20:05.400
OH, YOU KNOW WOMEN.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.300
THEY'RE ALWAYS
STARTING SOMETHING.

20:07.300 --> 20:10.667
DAD, I'M SORRY
I GOT ON YOUR CASE

20:10.667 --> 20:13.133
ABOUT YOU NOT
BEING ABLE TO TAKE US

20:13.133 --> 20:14.133
TO THE JERSEY SHORE.

20:14.133 --> 20:15.300
YOU KNOW, BETWEEN US,

20:15.300 --> 20:17.667
I'VE NEVER EVEN LIKED
GOOFY GOLF.

20:17.667 --> 20:19.600
YOU COULD'VE FOOLED ME.
YOU ALWAYS LOOKED LIKE

20:19.600 --> 20:20.867
YOU WERE HAVING
A LOT OF FUN.

20:20.867 --> 20:24.300
NO, NO. IF I NEVER SEE ANOTHER
GOOFY GOLF BALL AGAIN,

20:24.300 --> 20:25.600
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.600
OH, WELL, YOU'LL BE
REALLY DISAPPOINTED

20:28.600 --> 20:31.100
WHEN YOU SEE
WHAT'S IN THE BACKYARD.

20:31.100 --> 20:32.100
WHAT?

20:35.400 --> 20:37.367
WHOA!

20:37.367 --> 20:38.900
GOOFY GOLF!

20:38.900 --> 20:43.567
DID I MENTION HOW MUCH
I LOVE GOOFY GOLF?

20:43.567 --> 20:46.467
WELL, IT'S NOT EXACTLY
THE JERSEY SHORE.

20:46.467 --> 20:47.667
NO, IT'S BETTER.

20:47.667 --> 20:48.767
WE DON'T HAVE
TO DRIVE 3 HOURS

20:48.767 --> 20:50.367
WITH MORGAN
GETTING CARSICK

20:50.367 --> 20:52.500
AND MOM SINGING
SHOW TUNES.

20:52.500 --> 20:55.600
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT'S
WHY MORGAN GETS CARSICK.

20:55.600 --> 20:56.767
WELL, COME ON,
LET'S PLAY.

20:56.767 --> 20:59.600
LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN, IF
YOU WANT TO MAKE A HOLE IN ONE

20:59.600 --> 21:00.667
IN THE MARKET GIANT HERE,

21:00.667 --> 21:02.667
AIM FOR THE RIGHT ARMPIT.

21:02.667 --> 21:05.200
NO, THAT'LL BANK
INTO FEENY'S BACKYARD.

21:05.200 --> 21:05.767
NOT IF SOMEBODY
DESIGNED

21:05.767 --> 21:07.734
AN IMPERCEPTIBLE
LITTLE GROOVE

21:07.734 --> 21:10.300
THAT GUIDES THE BALL
INTO THE CUP.

21:10.300 --> 21:11.667
DAD!

21:11.667 --> 21:15.233
LET'S JUST KEEP THIS
BETWEEN US WINNERS.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.300
THREE!

21:16.300 --> 21:17.300
UH, FORE.

21:17.300 --> 21:18.467
WHATEVER.

21:18.467 --> 21:20.400
ARE YOU READY
TO POUND THESE WEENIES

21:20.400 --> 21:21.400
INTO THE GROUND

21:21.400 --> 21:23.133
FOR THE SEVENTH
STRAIGHT YEAR?

21:23.133 --> 21:24.400
NO MERCY.

21:24.400 --> 21:28.300
UNLESS YOU GUYS
WANT TO GIVE UP NOW.

21:28.300 --> 21:28.900
DO YOU WANT TO QUIT?

21:28.900 --> 21:32.600
OH, THAT'S NEVER BEEN
MY STYLE. HOW ABOUT YOU?

21:32.600 --> 21:34.934
I QUIT QUITTING.

21:36.467 --> 21:40.200
HEY, MY PARTNER AND I
ARE NOT QUITTERS.

21:42.300 --> 21:45.033
CHEATERS, YES.
QUITTERS, NO.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.700
OH, THAT THIS TOO, TOO
SOLID FLESH WOULD MELT,

21:55.700 --> 22:00.300
THAW AND RESOLVE ITSELF
INTO A DEW.

22:00.300 --> 22:02.367
THIS...BITES.

22:03.667 --> 22:06.500
IF I WAS
ANY MORE BORED,

22:06.500 --> 22:07.500
I'D BE DEAD.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.467
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

22:09.467 --> 22:11.834
WITHOUT US,
THERE'D BE NO PLAY.

22:11.834 --> 22:14.367
WE'RE THE FEW,
THE PROUD,

22:14.367 --> 22:16.400
THE SPEAR CARRIERS.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.600
GIVE ME A BREAK.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.500
NO ONE EVEN KNOWS
WE'RE HERE.

22:21.500 --> 22:24.300
MIGHT AS WELL
BE THAT WALL OVER THERE.

22:24.300 --> 22:25.600
HAVE SOME PRIDE, MAN.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.367
LIVE YOUR PART.

22:27.367 --> 22:29.500
MAKE IT YOUR OWN.

22:31.367 --> 22:32.367
OK.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.100
[POP]

22:37.400 --> 22:40.033
OH, I THINKS--OOH!

22:41.867 --> 22:46.100
AH! SHAKESPEARE
AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE.

22:56.567 --> 22:58.300
GRRR!
