is kind and loyal

35:32.088 --> 35:34.756

35:36.551 --> 35:38.385
You have to be able
to look deep into a man

35:38.386 --> 35:40.303
to know the nature of his heart.

35:41.931 --> 35:43.265
And to look deep, you-

35:43.266 --> 35:45.142
you have to have love.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.980
And you,
my precious nightingale,

35:49.981 --> 35:53.233
if you are not open
