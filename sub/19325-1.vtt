03:35.715 --> 03:37.275
You hear your boy on the radio?

03:37.284 --> 03:39.224
No idea who
you're talking about.

03:39.225 --> 03:40.650
Oh, yeah?

03:43.456 --> 03:45.716
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

03:48.561 --> 03:49.861
Yeah.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.297

We can't be late.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.246
Don't worry, I'll be there.

04:13.820 --> 04:17.656
- Morning, Miss Rusch.
- Preston? Hi.

04:17.658 --> 04:21.458
I wasn't expecting you
for another 15 minutes.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.602
And yet I was never here
in the first place.

04:23.603 --> 04:25.657
- Right?
- Right.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.626
So, what do you have for me?

04:31.738 --> 04:32.898
Tamra Jacobs?

04:32.906 --> 04:35.406
In her most devastating state
so far.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.609
It was last night,
Elements Club, Hollywood.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.481
Make it look like
paparazzi somehow.

04:39.482 --> 04:40.680
Slipped into the VIP area.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.781
But Tamra is your client.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.783
Do this for me
and I have grounds to drop her.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.685
You don't think she's
been through enough, I mean

04:47.688 --> 04:50.757
the eating disorder,
the rehab, her mom.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.688
- But, hey, if you don't want...
- Oh, no, no.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.533
You're right.
Maybe this will be good for her.

04:54.534 --> 04:57.358
- I just need the..
- Indemnification.

04:57.364 --> 04:59.534
Signed by me,
approved by my attorney.

04:59.535 --> 05:02.702
But listen, my name,
my firm's name

05:02.703 --> 05:04.937
stays out of her story.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.368
And there's a nice little check
in it for you too.

05:07.374 --> 05:08.874
Uh, I wasn't expecting
anything...

05:08.876 --> 05:11.606
Miss Rusch,
we all have an agenda.

05:11.612 --> 05:14.512
Remember that. You'll be running
this place in no time.

05:17.784 --> 05:19.786
[sighs]

05:19.787 --> 05:22.447
Matty, you're late.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.686
Did you get him?

05:23.691 --> 05:26.431
Luckily for you,
I'm always early.

05:28.394 --> 05:29.764
Ever tell my roomie I love him?

05:29.765 --> 05:31.531
Not enough.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.532
[Caleb] 'Wait, this isn't
even about Carson.'

05:33.534 --> 05:34.804
- Oh.
- Pretty good, right?

05:34.805 --> 05:36.572
Yeah. pretty good.

05:38.805 --> 05:40.735
You gonna talk to Rich
about running this?

05:40.741 --> 05:42.711
I'm gonna talk to Rich
about running this today.

05:42.712 --> 05:44.440
Just gotta check in
the chair first.

05:44.445 --> 05:48.445
Well, photos inbound
in five to ten.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.379
'We're gonna make that headline,
Matty, I can feel it.'

05:50.384 --> 05:51.754
You say that every time.

05:51.755 --> 05:54.352
Well, this time,
it's finally true.

06:01.928 --> 06:04.728
If you're doing that thing,
well, you're mad, and, uh

06:04.732 --> 06:06.732
you won't tell me why.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.767
You were just live on the air.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.840
And you had about as much
charisma as my ex-husband had

06:11.841 --> 06:13.709
the day that he begged me
not to leave.

06:13.710 --> 06:16.137
Wow! This is
a good pep talk. Yeah.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.513
Why are you committing
career suicide?

06:19.612 --> 06:22.081
Freddy's right.
Ever since Veronica.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.682
Freddy is a tool, Viv.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.586
No! Freddy is a multi-Grammy
award-winning producer

06:26.587 --> 06:28.447
who's worked with every
platinum-selling artist

06:28.455 --> 06:29.885
under the age of 30.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.960
Or do you not want another
platinum-selling album?

06:31.961 --> 06:34.529
This isn't even
one of my songs, alright?

06:34.530 --> 06:36.558
I only agreed to do this
to help out Carson.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.563
Caleb, you couldn't even write

06:38.565 --> 06:41.525
one original song
for your new album.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.935
But because of Carson,
we have an EP.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.037
The first step
to your big comeback

06:46.039 --> 06:48.639
but the fans need to believe
that you're both in it.

06:48.642 --> 06:51.180
So if not for yourself,
do it for her.

06:51.181 --> 06:53.478
Wait, this isn't even
about Carson.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.548
And it's not about you.

06:55.549 --> 06:58.549
Caleb, your voice is a product.

06:58.552 --> 07:02.552
Your face is an album cover,
and your name is a business.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.756
At least fake like you care.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.888
Okay?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.497
- I got your email.
- Yeah?

07:11.498 --> 07:13.898
No! Business Affairs
will never sign off on it.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.771
They'd say it's too much
of a liability.

07:15.772 --> 07:18.669
They, they already did.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.742
Preston's agreement
is specific to anonymity

07:20.743 --> 07:22.641
in an article we run on Tamra.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.512
My article won't even
mention her.

07:24.513 --> 07:25.980
I've already got
four testimonials

07:25.981 --> 07:28.079
all starlets that he's been
inappropriate with

07:28.081 --> 07:29.649
during their contracts.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.750
He's not a legitimate agent.
He's a leech.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.587
Well, I didn't hire you
to be a crusader.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.788
I hired you because
you were a solid writer

07:36.790 --> 07:39.020
'and you're good
at getting people to open up'

07:39.026 --> 07:42.526
to people who sell headlines.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.029
This guy, he, he's an agent.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.531
No one cares what he does.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.171
Well, they might
when they find out

07:48.172 --> 07:50.498
the names of the starlets
who are going to come forward.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.806
Oh.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.767
Now, isn't that
headline material?

07:55.776 --> 07:58.006
Oh, it is.
It's good, you know.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.149
Write it up,
it'll make a strong sideline.

08:00.150 --> 08:01.947
You know this is
bigger than that.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.949
It's not bigger than
the whale Smith brought in.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.789
Did you see that video?
Now, that's a headline.

08:06.790 --> 08:09.517
This is unbelievable.
I stuck my neck out for this.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.123
And it's good reporting.
Take the win.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.862
'And if you want a headline'

08:12.863 --> 08:15.790
you're gonna need to bring me
something huge.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.796
Alright, you want a whale?
I'll get you a whale.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.529
That's the spirit.

08:20.534 --> 08:21.567
Hey.

08:21.568 --> 08:22.628
[chuckles]

08:22.636 --> 08:23.666
Grab a harpoon gun

08:23.670 --> 08:24.940
on your way out the door.

08:33.011 --> 08:35.251
Ah! Let me guess
who these are from.

08:35.251 --> 08:36.649
Well, it wouldn't be Valentine's

08:36.650 --> 08:38.020
if your parents
didn't send you roses.

08:38.020 --> 08:39.986
[chuckles]
Yeah.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.746
And a week early.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.656
They must have seen the article.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.526
Sorry about the headline.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.587
At least your parents didn't
know the difference, right?

08:48.595 --> 08:49.725
Yeah.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.763
'I'll get it next time.'

08:52.766 --> 08:53.896
Yeah.

08:57.737 --> 09:00.106
'Do you think
I should change my alias?'

09:00.107 --> 09:01.937
Is Natalie Rushing too obvious?

09:01.942 --> 09:03.942
I mean, my parents
figured it out.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.114
No, no, no, you need to have
your name in there somewhere.

09:06.115 --> 09:09.181
Otherwise, how will you get
any of the glory?

09:09.182 --> 09:11.150
Oh, wow! What is that?

09:11.151 --> 09:12.751
You know, I don't have
a name for it yet

09:12.753 --> 09:14.793
but I'm toying
with "The love-love."

09:14.794 --> 09:18.118
Oh! Unh-unh. Nope.
Can't go with that.

09:18.125 --> 09:21.325
Sorry. It was supposed to be
a congratulatory dinner.

09:25.097 --> 09:26.257
To next time.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.233
May nothing stand in your way.

09:30.903 --> 09:34.242
In music news, two-time
Grammy-winner, Caleb Greene

09:34.243 --> 09:36.581
'announced a release
of his upcoming album'

09:36.582 --> 09:39.707
' "Heartbreaker" on KROJ LA
earlier today.'

09:39.713 --> 09:41.751
'Greene, who's famous
for his blend'

09:41.752 --> 09:44.278
of contemporary rock and pop,
has been laying low

09:44.284 --> 09:46.354
ever since
the 30-year-old musician

09:46.355 --> 09:48.153
'proposed to his ex-girlfriend'

09:48.155 --> 09:50.085
'and a runway model
Veronica Savini'

09:50.090 --> 09:52.358
'at a show
last year in Boston.'

09:52.359 --> 09:54.959
Only to have Savini
deny his proposal

09:54.962 --> 09:56.800
in front of a thousand fans.

09:56.801 --> 09:59.797
'All of this, amid rumors
of his infidelity in courtship'

09:59.800 --> 10:03.230
'had made it a very rough year
on Caleb Greene.'

10:03.236 --> 10:05.896
'Greene's album will see
its release just two weeks'

10:05.906 --> 10:09.106
'after a special release
with his new work featuring'

10:09.109 --> 10:12.109
singer-dancer Carson Peet,
formerly of the Vegas Vixens

10:12.112 --> 10:13.750
who has also confirmed to be

10:13.751 --> 10:16.147
his opening act
on his upcoming tour.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.749
'Fans everywhere will
get to see this EP'

10:18.752 --> 10:20.186
'on Valentine's Day.'

10:20.187 --> 10:22.147
But the real question is

10:22.155 --> 10:23.915
"Are the rumors true?

10:23.924 --> 10:26.834
And is there more than just
music in the air for these two?"

10:30.162 --> 10:31.862
First, their
insanely catchy song

10:31.865 --> 10:33.825
and now she's opening
for his tour?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.403
I'm gonna barf Love-love.

10:35.404 --> 10:37.770
You can't stick a claim
on Caleb Greene just because

10:37.771 --> 10:39.641
the two of you played hide-and
- go-seek when you were kids.

10:39.642 --> 10:41.740
It was more
than hide-and-seek.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.072
And we had friendship bracelets.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.106
That is basically
marriage between kids.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.879
Can you blame the guy?

10:46.880 --> 10:50.380
I mean, Carson Peet is
America's sexiest sweetheart.

10:50.384 --> 10:53.022
Maybe now, but she wasn't
always like that.

10:53.023 --> 10:54.950
Oh, yeah, and how would
you know that?

10:54.955 --> 10:57.055
Because I went to school
with her too.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.287
Excuse me. Wait,
you went to school

10:59.292 --> 11:02.662
with Caleb Greene
and Carson Peet?

11:02.663 --> 11:05.197
It was a school for the arts
in Orange County, okay?

11:05.198 --> 11:07.198
You have no idea
how many of my former classmates

11:07.200 --> 11:08.300
are more successful than me.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.301
We-were you and Carson friends?

11:10.303 --> 11:13.172
No. Yes.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.113
I don't, I don't know.

11:16.142 --> 11:17.742
Sorry, this is too good.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.179
[chuckles]

11:20.180 --> 11:21.350
Well..

11:23.349 --> 11:25.418
We were like best friends
in middle school

11:25.419 --> 11:28.319
and then it got weird
in high school..

11:30.156 --> 11:33.056
Because she was just
always way too busy for me

11:33.060 --> 11:35.990
with her dancing and her acting
and her singing, and...

11:35.996 --> 11:37.126
-And Caleb... No.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.760
She didn't even go there
when he did.

11:38.765 --> 11:39.855
He moved after third grade

11:39.866 --> 11:41.926
and she moved there
during sixth.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.395
Hold on. Wait. How do they
even know each other?

11:43.403 --> 11:44.803
I didn't even think they did

11:44.805 --> 11:48.035
until I found out
about their new EP.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.476
And now you're jealous
of Carson and him.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.107
Yeah, but, like,
she knew how much I liked him

11:52.112 --> 11:54.112
all through middle school,
and I bet you she's the one

11:54.114 --> 11:55.883
that he cheated
on Veronica Savini with

11:55.884 --> 11:58.282
and now they're
promoting some new EP

11:58.285 --> 12:00.485
as if they were
actually in love, like..

12:00.487 --> 12:02.147
Give me a break.

12:05.758 --> 12:08.858
- Matty, that's it.
- What's it?

12:08.862 --> 12:11.302
This isn't just a whale,
this is Moby Dick.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.768
Hi, mom.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.142
Hi, do you, by chance

12:23.143 --> 12:25.243
still talk
to Carson Peet's parents?

12:25.245 --> 12:26.475
Oh!

12:40.426 --> 12:43.756
Okay, so what's the story
in your head?

12:43.764 --> 12:46.432
Deceit. Betrayal. Heartbreak.

12:46.433 --> 12:50.072
A torrid love affair turns into
a sordid marketing campaign.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.770
[laughs] Okay, a little
less romance novel

12:52.773 --> 12:54.210
a little more facts, please.

12:54.211 --> 12:56.467
The timeline between Caleb's
rejected proposal

12:56.476 --> 13:00.406
and his pairing with Carson
is way too short.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.982
What if Veronica said no

13:02.983 --> 13:05.283
because Caleb really
did cheat on her?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.815
And what if that person

13:07.821 --> 13:10.021
just so happened to be

13:10.023 --> 13:12.093
the opening act
of his latest tour?

13:12.094 --> 13:14.560
It's a good story if it's true.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.291
I believe that it is.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.826
And someone needs to break it
before the paps catch them

13:19.833 --> 13:20.973
macking down in Mumbai

13:20.974 --> 13:23.836
and... that person is me.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.197
Okay, so-so, what if
there was no affair

13:26.206 --> 13:28.136
and what if the timing
was all just some

13:28.141 --> 13:29.541
crazy coincidence

13:29.543 --> 13:32.311
and it is true love?

13:32.312 --> 13:35.212
Then we have
a Valentine's Day puff piece.

13:35.215 --> 13:38.475
A nice sideline
about true love conquering all.

13:39.285 --> 13:42.445
But... if I'm right..

13:42.455 --> 13:45.415
Oh, then it would make
one heck of a headline.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.389
My intuition is not off, Rich.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.825
Fine, I-I think you have
a story, and I trust you.

13:51.832 --> 13:55.102
Just be careful with Greene,
his reps don't play around.

13:55.868 --> 13:57.338
And neither do I.

14:09.548 --> 14:11.317
Allie Rusch.

14:11.318 --> 14:14.086
Huh, I don't believe it!

14:14.087 --> 14:17.056
Carson, hi!
It's so good to see you.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.987
Oh, you have to tell me
everything. Come on.

14:19.925 --> 14:21.485
I am so glad you texted me.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.997
What has it been, ten years?
Mai-Tai? You Tai?

14:24.998 --> 14:27.867
Oh, uh, I'll just have
a-a Pino Gris. It's good.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.898
Oh, everything here is good.
I come here all the time.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.603
We'll take two seaweed salads
and a tiger roll.

14:31.605 --> 14:33.535
You like tiger rolls?
Rah! They're great.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.109
[speaking foreign language]

14:35.110 --> 14:37.508
Wow! It feels like just
yesterday you were writing

14:37.510 --> 14:39.510
all those articles
for the Harmony Arts Herald.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.412
[chuckles] Usually, with
you gracing the cover

14:42.415 --> 14:46.175
as the star of the step dance
show. Chorus line.

14:46.186 --> 14:49.146
Look at you now,
you are literally a rock star.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.215
Thank you.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.293
And what about you?
How are you?

14:52.294 --> 14:54.526
Oh, I'm, I'm good.

14:54.527 --> 14:58.097
Uh, just working for
a publication here in Hollywood.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.028
Oh! That's so exciting!

15:00.033 --> 15:01.367
Is it everything?

15:01.368 --> 15:04.136
Oh, yeah, it-it can be.

15:04.137 --> 15:07.367
Just always looking
for that next big story.

15:07.374 --> 15:11.277
Also, did I hear that you are
opening for Caleb Greene?

15:11.278 --> 15:12.608
That's huge!

15:12.612 --> 15:14.352
Well, it's kind of like, um..

15:15.281 --> 15:16.581
Everything?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.383
Exactly.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.945
Oh, you still get me
after all these years.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.087
[chuckles]

15:22.088 --> 15:24.218
Oh.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.324
Yay!

15:26.326 --> 15:27.556
Dig in.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.230
[speaking foreign language]

15:29.231 --> 15:31.059
Thanks.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.132
Yeah, uh, you know,
it's so funny

15:33.133 --> 15:34.573
remember how I was
telling you that, uh..

15:34.574 --> 15:36.597
Caleb also went to Harmony Arts?

15:36.603 --> 15:39.171
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.707
And you had that
major crush on him.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.408
And do you still?

15:43.410 --> 15:47.110
Ugh, no. That was just
a, a silly childhood crush.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.080
But you and him must be getting

15:50.083 --> 15:52.418
pretty close these days, huh?

15:52.419 --> 15:54.249
Oh, come on,
I can keep a secret.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.992
I get it, it's Caleb Greene.

15:55.993 --> 15:58.589
I mean, every girl had a crush
on him back in school.

15:58.591 --> 16:01.126
I know, but... no.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.657
My manager just wanted me
to team up with a name

16:03.663 --> 16:05.333
so that I can go out on my own.

16:05.334 --> 16:08.100
Oh. That's nice.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.431
Ooh, you know what?

16:09.436 --> 16:10.996
We're shooting
a music video tomorrow.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.642
You should come by
and hang out on set.

16:12.643 --> 16:14.206
It will give you
and Caleb a chance

16:14.207 --> 16:15.367
to catch up like old friends.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.175
Um, yeah, I would love to.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.578
Good, it's a date.

16:38.364 --> 16:41.500
- Whoa! Sweet!
- Okay, be cool.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.771
'We're not here
to cause a scene.'

16:42.772 --> 16:44.199
'We're here to get intel.'

16:44.204 --> 16:46.404
So just no more
words like "Sweet," okay?

16:47.306 --> 16:48.506
Whatever.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.108
That's perfect.
I'm gonna wear this.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.640
- Oh, you're not gonna wear it.
- No, I'm gonna wear it.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.746
Alright, look,
this isn't your video shoot.

16:53.747 --> 16:55.147
'It's not a big deal,
I don't need'

16:55.148 --> 16:56.348
'to be shirtless
all the time.'

16:56.349 --> 16:57.679
'I'm just gonna wear a tank.'

16:57.684 --> 17:00.394
'Alright, got it. Great.
Here it is, let's go.'

17:07.659 --> 17:10.598
Ahh! So good you came.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.200
Is that your boyfriend?

17:15.201 --> 17:18.501
- Oh, no, no.
- Oh.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.734
Keeley, Kendra,
this is my friend Allie, and..

17:21.741 --> 17:23.671
- Hi.
- Hi, uh, this, uh, Matty.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.675
And Matty.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.608
Allie and I went
to high school together.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.814
She's a reporter.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.676
[laughing]

17:31.684 --> 17:33.752
Keeley and Kendra are doing
backup for the video.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.593
I trained with them
before I started The Vixens.

17:35.594 --> 17:37.118
Can I get a quick photo
of you two?

17:37.123 --> 17:38.690
Yeah.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.391
[Matty] 'Uh, Carson, you
wanna jump in there?'

17:40.393 --> 17:42.693
- Oh, duh, get in here.
- Okay.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.695
Okay, on the count of one, two..

17:44.697 --> 17:46.457
- Trifecta!
- Trifecta!

17:46.466 --> 17:48.366
Love it.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.768
Carson, hi.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.369
Who are your friends here?

17:51.371 --> 17:53.741
Oh, this is my manager,
Vivian Cartwright.

17:53.742 --> 17:55.140
And our producer, Freddy.

17:55.141 --> 17:56.611
Viv, this is my friend, Allie.

17:56.612 --> 17:58.439
[Vivian]
Oh, sweet.

17:58.445 --> 18:01.575
Okay, are we ready to get
started? Your hair needs help.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.411
Oh, really? The director said
that he liked it.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.616
Can we have hair here? Stat?

18:05.618 --> 18:07.548
Where is the director?

18:07.554 --> 18:09.592
Uh, just find some place
to hang out.

18:09.593 --> 18:12.159
- We have snacks over there.
- Great. Don't worry about us.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.526
Matty, find Caleb and get photos

18:15.528 --> 18:17.328
of all his
interactions with her.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.160
She's super nice. She's not
shallow or self-indulgent...

18:19.165 --> 18:21.665
Yeah, she was in school, okay?

18:21.668 --> 18:23.528
Now, will you please go
get some photos?

18:24.570 --> 18:25.870
[sighs]

18:28.273 --> 18:29.813
[sighs]
Oh, man.

18:31.243 --> 18:33.312
Oh.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.183
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, no, go ahead.

18:35.184 --> 18:36.651
We, uh, got more.

18:39.418 --> 18:42.187
Um, you don't look like
you should be replenishing

18:42.188 --> 18:44.618
the licorice, don't they
have someone for that?

18:44.624 --> 18:46.524
You don't exactly
look like a dancer.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.590
Disappointed?

18:51.430 --> 18:54.430
No, they all kinda look
the same anyways.

18:55.534 --> 18:56.804
I'm Caleb, by the way.

18:56.805 --> 18:59.673
Oh, I know who you are.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.436
I'm Allie.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.783
Allie Rusch.

19:06.445 --> 19:08.205
I'm a friend of Carson's.

19:08.214 --> 19:09.614
Oh, really?

19:09.616 --> 19:10.876
It's weird I haven't met ya.

19:10.884 --> 19:12.618
No?

19:12.619 --> 19:14.249
I thought we had.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.456
My mistake.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.657
So, how long have you
and Carson known each other?

19:19.659 --> 19:22.159
Oh, Carson and I,
we go way back.

19:22.162 --> 19:25.232
But, uh, not as far back
as you two apparently.

19:25.233 --> 19:27.531
Oh, yeah, we're,
you know, me and you.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.534
- Huh?
- What?

19:29.536 --> 19:32.496
Oh, nothing,
I was just saying, um, you know

19:32.505 --> 19:36.205
the two of you
making music together..

19:36.209 --> 19:37.476
Yep.

19:37.477 --> 19:40.507
So, uh, what exactly do you do?

19:40.513 --> 19:42.413
Oh, I'm a dancer.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.215
[chuckles]

19:44.217 --> 19:45.747
I'm, I'm a journalist.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.819
Where do you work?

19:47.820 --> 19:51.720
Oh, um,
uh, "The Valley Voice."

19:52.391 --> 19:53.621
Hm.

19:55.661 --> 19:57.261
What is that, that "Hm?"

19:58.263 --> 19:59.331
Nothin'.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.400
I mean, it's just... interesting

20:01.401 --> 20:04.539
that, uh, all of a sudden
Carson's journalist friend

20:04.540 --> 20:08.267
comes out of the woodworks
and just starts chattin' me up.

20:08.274 --> 20:11.910
Well, that is a little arrogant
and a lot accusatory.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.551
Hey, I'm just, uh, speaking
from experience, alright.

20:14.552 --> 20:16.247
No offense.

20:16.249 --> 20:19.518
Oh, lucky for you,
I don't get... offended

20:19.519 --> 20:20.886
very easily.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.247
Though if I am speaking
from experience

20:23.256 --> 20:26.386
based on the interaction with
the costumer up there earlier

20:26.392 --> 20:29.592
I'd say your arrogance
speaks for itself.

20:29.596 --> 20:30.926
Also, I don't
usually waste my time

20:30.930 --> 20:32.560
with people who aren't trending.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.365
Ouch!

20:34.367 --> 20:37.536
It's cute though that you
thought I was here for you.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.237
[male #1] 'Alright, everyone in
their places for a picture.'

20:41.440 --> 20:43.008

20:43.009 --> 20:44.876
Uh, aren't you in this?

20:44.877 --> 20:47.307
Uh, no, I don't enter
until half way through.

20:47.313 --> 20:48.547
But you know what?

20:48.548 --> 20:51.248
You would make a great director.

20:51.251 --> 20:52.621
Yeah, yeah, definitely,
you know that.

20:52.622 --> 20:55.249
Nice and, uh, bossy.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.645
Oh, it was nice to meet you.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.556
Oh, congrats
on your new album by the way.

20:58.558 --> 21:01.458
- Watch out for the..
- Oh!

21:03.028 --> 21:04.358
It was nice to meet you too.

21:17.909 --> 21:20.909
Okay, picture's up,
let's roll sound.

- Amazing.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.540
Excellent! Excellent!
You guys, perfect.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.946
- Thanks.
- 'Perfect, perfect, perfect.'

23:39.551 --> 23:41.191
You girls were great, thank you.

23:45.557 --> 23:46.657
Stop.

23:48.059 --> 23:49.759
Hey, did you see
what I'm seeing?

23:51.163 --> 23:53.432
Caleb and Carson,
the way they were interacting.

23:53.433 --> 23:56.733
I think I was wrong. I don't
think they're really together.

23:56.736 --> 23:59.096
Wait, so, so Carson's single?

23:59.105 --> 24:00.565
Wait.. And Caleb?

24:00.573 --> 24:03.011
Well, this is perfect
for us, right?

24:03.012 --> 24:04.509
Uh, wait, no, no, it's not.

24:04.510 --> 24:05.940
If they're not really a thing

24:05.945 --> 24:07.105
then there is no story.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.013
Are you so sure about that?

24:09.948 --> 24:11.478
- Hi.
- Hey.

24:11.484 --> 24:13.154
Can you excuse us for a second?

24:13.155 --> 24:16.588
- Okay.
- No, um..

24:16.589 --> 24:21.089
Allie Rusch.
AKA, Natalie Rushing.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.828
425 Aspendale Drive

24:22.829 --> 24:24.696
Bachelor in Communications

24:24.697 --> 24:26.757
former copy editor
for "The Herald"

24:26.766 --> 24:29.226
current ladder climber
for "The Spread."

24:29.235 --> 24:31.795
Went to school with both
my clients during your youth.

24:31.804 --> 24:35.006
So, what's the real scoop,
Miss Rusch?

24:35.007 --> 24:37.137
Oh, scoop?

24:37.143 --> 24:38.977
No, no scoop.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.847
No, uh, Caleb just assumed
I was here because of him.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.608
And I was just saying
there is no story

24:43.616 --> 24:44.846
so there's nothing.

24:44.851 --> 24:48.151
Don't lie to me, Miss Rusch.
Let me guess.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.692
You wanna crack the rumors
about Carson and Caleb's

24:50.693 --> 24:52.790
romantic relationship
for your tabloid.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.492
So what?

24:54.494 --> 24:56.964
There is no harm in a nice
love story for Valentine's Day.

24:56.965 --> 24:58.963
Caleb and Carson?

24:58.965 --> 25:01.265
- That is perfect.
- Huh?

25:01.267 --> 25:02.967
You know, I always knew
that there was something there

25:02.969 --> 25:05.038
between them,
they just refuse to admit it.

25:05.039 --> 25:07.637
But maybe you could
get it out of them.

25:07.640 --> 25:08.970
I mean, you have history there.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.665
And it could make for
a wonderful story.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.206
Why do you care
if I get a story?

25:12.211 --> 25:14.846
It's almost Valentine's,
Miss Rusch.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.807
Do you have any idea
what sells even better

25:16.816 --> 25:18.176
than a good love song?

25:18.184 --> 25:20.051
Love.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.292
Two sexy stars
announcing their love

25:22.293 --> 25:24.656
on the release of their new EP.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.287
Who wouldn't pay to hear that?

25:27.192 --> 25:28.762
Just think about it.

25:36.234 --> 25:38.603
Doesn't look like Carson has
probably dated anyone

25:38.604 --> 25:41.706
since they met in Vegas
last year either.

25:41.707 --> 25:44.576
Maybe Vivian was right,
maybe they do have something

25:44.577 --> 25:47.546
and just don't realize it yet.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.207
Look how cute she is
in this photo.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.245
Wow, great evidence, Matty.
Thank you.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.850
What? Well, you said so yourself
there was nothing

25:52.852 --> 25:54.022
conspicuous to photograph.

25:54.023 --> 25:56.320
Okay, well, maybe we're looking

25:56.322 --> 25:57.691
for something too obvious.

25:57.692 --> 25:58.859
Maybe we need to dig deeper.

25:58.860 --> 26:00.258
What do you have in mind?

26:00.259 --> 26:02.759
Maybe if we caught them
interacting outside of work

26:02.762 --> 26:04.862
they'd behave differently
toward each other.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.704
I mean, she did mention that
she had dinner plans tonight

26:06.705 --> 26:08.899
but she didn't say with who.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.971
Why would she mention
that to you?

26:12.203 --> 26:15.740
Uh, I may have
asked her on a date.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.108
Matty..

26:17.109 --> 26:18.779
I told you
she's my favorite Vegas Vixen.

26:18.780 --> 26:20.278
Will you please focus?

26:22.047 --> 26:24.007
- Did she say where?
- Not exactly.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.646
I mean, yeah,
I mean, she kept going on

26:25.651 --> 26:26.718
about Mai-Tai's

26:26.719 --> 26:27.919
and, and tiger rolls.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.350
Come on.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.745
- Wait, wait, okay.
- Come on.

26:30.756 --> 26:31.856
Hold on.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.971
[speaking foreign language]

26:43.735 --> 26:45.095
Okay, you have to try this.

26:45.104 --> 26:48.206
Yellow Tail is my favorite.
Get in here.

26:48.207 --> 26:50.637
You love Yellow Tail too?

26:50.643 --> 26:53.313
Just pull it together, you've
known her for, like, four hours.

26:54.813 --> 26:56.151
Alright, now, get me
some good shots, okay?

26:56.152 --> 26:57.748
I'm gonna get out of here
before they see me.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.220
You got it.

27:01.653 --> 27:03.823
[Carson]
Mm-hmm. Right.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.757
So, can I get you
something to eat?

27:07.760 --> 27:09.760
Would you like to try
our crunchy caterpillar roll?

27:09.762 --> 27:11.662
- It's very good.
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

27:11.664 --> 27:12.934
Can you just mind just moving..

27:12.935 --> 27:15.332
There's this girl, she just,
wait, just wait.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.904
Yeah, thank you very.. Ah!

27:23.975 --> 27:27.105
Oh, it's a..
I lost my wasabi.

27:27.113 --> 27:30.348
I found it. I found it.

27:30.349 --> 27:31.649
Okay.

27:34.185 --> 27:35.385
[retching]

27:41.192 --> 27:43.161
- Allie?
- Caleb!

27:43.162 --> 27:45.132
[chuckles]
Hey, how's it goin'?

27:45.133 --> 27:47.699
Um, what are you,
what are you doing here?

27:47.700 --> 27:49.000
I could ask you
the same question.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.670
Oh, we were just
finishing up dinner.

27:51.671 --> 27:52.971
- We?
- Oh.

27:52.972 --> 27:56.672
Uh, Matty, my colleague,
he's just paying out.

27:56.676 --> 27:58.806
- Who are you here with?
- Actually, uh, Carson.

27:58.811 --> 27:59.881
We are doing
this charity thing together

27:59.882 --> 28:01.248
uh, Red Hearts Society.

28:01.249 --> 28:03.177
- Oh, how nice.
- Alright, I gotta leave early.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.816
I got this, uh..

28:04.817 --> 28:06.347
Super early morning
weight-lifting session.

28:06.352 --> 28:07.886
- Yay.
- Ah, well.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.947
Gotta keep those guns loaded.

28:09.955 --> 28:11.315
[chuckling]

28:11.323 --> 28:13.263
You know, I think
that I've figured out

28:13.264 --> 28:15.026
how I remember you.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.327
We used to be, like,
uh, neighbors

28:16.328 --> 28:17.388
when we were kids, right?

28:17.396 --> 28:19.356
Carson said you're from Harmony.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.765
Uh-huh.

28:21.767 --> 28:23.267
- Was that you?
- Oh, come on.

28:23.269 --> 28:26.337
Shady Lane,
Harmony Pre-K.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.268
We used to play
hide-and-seek

28:28.274 --> 28:30.044
in that old,
abandoned sugar mill.

28:30.045 --> 28:31.776
Oh, wow, I can't believe

28:31.777 --> 28:33.337
you remember that.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.075
Well, I mean, I only remember
because the last time

28:35.081 --> 28:37.781
we played, I, uh,
well, I destroyed you.

28:37.783 --> 28:40.353
I'm pretty sure you never
actually caught me once.

28:40.354 --> 28:42.187
Uh, I sure did, yeah.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.788
In fact, I remember,
because when I did

28:44.790 --> 28:46.290
you gave me that, uh,
what was it, like, uh

28:46.292 --> 28:48.792
like, pink and-and black

28:48.794 --> 28:50.332
friendship bracelet
or something?

28:50.333 --> 28:52.059
And you told me to keep yours

28:52.064 --> 28:53.834
so that I never forgot you.

28:53.835 --> 28:56.471
Well, for the record,
you told me to keep mine

28:56.472 --> 28:58.469
so that I would
always remember you.

28:58.471 --> 29:00.171
Oh! Well, did you?

29:00.172 --> 29:03.372
Oh. No, I have no idea
where that thing is.

29:03.375 --> 29:06.275
[chuckles]
Me neither.

29:06.278 --> 29:09.147
You know, that was right
around the time that my parents

29:09.148 --> 29:11.118
got me an agent
and I moved up here.

29:11.119 --> 29:14.147
- Yeah?
- And you still look the same.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.287
- I do?
- Yeah.

29:16.288 --> 29:17.958
You know, half, uh, confident

29:17.959 --> 29:20.057
half haphazard.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.759
Eh, it suits you.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.291
Well, it was only because
you always insisted

29:23.295 --> 29:25.295
on being "It" first.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.827
It made me nervous.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.968
Hey, you know, Carson
and I were throwing

29:29.969 --> 29:31.269
this little V-Day thing
in my house

29:31.270 --> 29:33.170
this weekend, you should come.

29:33.172 --> 29:34.872
Eh, unless you have,
like, a romantic retreat

29:34.874 --> 29:36.314
with your boyfriend planned.

29:36.315 --> 29:40.878
Oh, no, I-I don't have,
uh, uh, one of those.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.080
But you and Carson, huh?

29:43.082 --> 29:45.282
Sweet, you guys are like
a really cute couple.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.284
[chuckles] No, Carson and
I, we're not together.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.786
In fact, it's an
anti-Valentine's party

29:49.789 --> 29:51.919
so, um, singles only.

29:51.924 --> 29:55.326
Ah. Well, romance is..

29:55.327 --> 29:57.457
You know, kind of what
you make it, right?

29:57.463 --> 30:01.063
And I would rethink dissing
commercializing love.

30:01.066 --> 30:03.566
You have made
an entire career off of it.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.036
<i>Touche,</i> Reporter Rusch.

30:07.039 --> 30:08.569
You're good.
No, no, you're really good.

30:08.574 --> 30:13.411
Only, I don't think you know me
as well as you think you do.

30:13.412 --> 30:17.012
Apparently, I've only
known you my whole life.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.076
And yet people still see
what they wanna see.

30:20.985 --> 30:23.315
Like, when a badgering costumer

30:23.322 --> 30:25.990
insists that I go shirtless

30:25.991 --> 30:29.828
when, honestly,
I, uh, just don't want

30:29.829 --> 30:32.459
to have to exploit
myself for once.

30:32.464 --> 30:35.366
<i>Touche.</i> Sorry.

30:35.367 --> 30:38.037
No, it's-it's okay.
Honestly, I'm used to it.

30:40.205 --> 30:41.605
I think that's my ride.
You need a lift?

30:41.607 --> 30:43.067
Oh, uh, no.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.575
I'm just waiting
for Matty... though.

30:45.578 --> 30:47.408
Thank you, though.

30:47.413 --> 30:48.483
But, uh, hey,
this-this weekend

30:48.484 --> 30:49.610
I'll see you there, right?

30:49.615 --> 30:51.315
I'll think about it.

30:55.353 --> 30:57.989
[clears throat]
And, um..

30:57.990 --> 31:00.260
Oh, right. You're "it."

31:05.864 --> 31:07.204
Now I know why Carson
doesn't wanna admit

31:07.205 --> 31:08.229
her feelings for him.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.969
He's such a flirt.

31:10.970 --> 31:13.270
She's probably worried
he's gonna cheat on her too.

31:14.472 --> 31:16.072
Yet, you don't much
seem to mind.

31:16.075 --> 31:19.205
I don't still have
a thing for him, okay?

31:19.211 --> 31:21.411
I'm in the middle of trying
to procure our story.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.483
Look, have you ever given
any thought that maybe

31:23.484 --> 31:27.018
they're just friends
who work together..

31:27.019 --> 31:28.249
A lot like us?

31:28.254 --> 31:30.654
Matty, they have to have
something, though.

31:30.656 --> 31:33.186
I mean, we saw them tonight.

31:33.192 --> 31:35.262
She was feeding him
a Yellow Tail.

31:40.064 --> 31:42.034
[both laughing]

31:45.403 --> 31:47.972
Fine. Maybe I am a little
up in arms right now

31:47.973 --> 31:50.541
but... it's just because all

31:50.542 --> 31:52.442
of my worlds
are currently colliding.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.614

41:47.038 --> 41:48.568
Hey, guys.

41:48.573 --> 41:50.973
Okay, so, this is the stuff
for tomorrow.

41:50.976 --> 41:53.206
Allie and Matty, you guys
are gonna set up the <i>pinata</i>

41:53.211 --> 41:56.180
in the photo booth
over there and over there.

41:56.181 --> 41:57.681
And the other stuff
is what Denise

41:57.682 --> 41:58.916
brought for the swag bag.

41:58.917 --> 42:00.577
So, Todd, you can
help her out with that.

42:00.585 --> 42:02.245
And, Caleb, you and I
are gonna be in

42:02.254 --> 42:04.124
the kitchen making <i>hors</i>
<i>d'oeuvres</i> and cupid cookies.

42:04.125 --> 42:06.162
What.. No, no.
I'm a terrible cook, alright.

42:06.163 --> 42:09.057
I doing all things
anti-Valentine's Day.

42:09.060 --> 42:11.260
Like..

42:11.263 --> 42:13.531
This.

42:13.532 --> 42:15.732
Ah, I'm actually
a pretty great cook

42:15.734 --> 42:17.201
if you..

42:17.202 --> 42:18.802
Oh. Okay.

42:18.803 --> 42:21.071
So, Caleb, you help Allie

42:21.072 --> 42:24.108
and, Matty, you're with me.

42:24.109 --> 42:26.839
And then this is for you.

42:27.244 --> 42:28.584
Perfect.

42:29.079 --> 42:30.279
[scoffs]

42:30.282 --> 42:31.782
Stupid cupid, huh?

42:31.783 --> 42:33.983
Guess so.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.115
- Let's go.
- Ohh.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.590
- Really?
- Yes.

42:37.621 --> 42:39.661
[both chuckling]

42:41.859 --> 42:43.989
[Caleb] I think I did
a pretty good job.

42:45.863 --> 42:47.333
We did a pretty good job.

42:47.334 --> 42:50.601
Alright, what's next?

42:50.602 --> 42:52.670
Ooh.

42:52.671 --> 42:54.701
<i>- Pinata?
- Oh.</i>

42:54.706 --> 42:57.136
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:03.814 --> 43:06.754
- So I guess the idea is..
- To break the heart.

43:06.755 --> 43:10.151
Oh, fitting.
Heartbreaker.

43:10.155 --> 43:15.055
Uh, yeah, the title
of my new album. How original.

43:15.060 --> 43:17.930
Oh, of course, as decided
by one Mr. Freddy Craig.

43:21.131 --> 43:22.301
Uh..

43:23.601 --> 43:25.301
You trying to get close?

43:27.771 --> 43:29.241
You're "it."

43:32.376 --> 43:33.906
- Come on.
- Uh..

43:33.912 --> 43:35.750
Huh, why don't you go ahead
and do that?

43:35.751 --> 43:38.207
I don't wanna get too close
to the Caleb Greene

43:38.216 --> 43:39.646
who's got
his bodyguard here, so.

43:39.651 --> 43:42.386
Oh, come on, I hate it

43:42.387 --> 43:44.187
when they assign me a bodyguard.

43:44.189 --> 43:46.919
I mean, seriously,
they always breathe heavy

43:46.925 --> 43:49.885
and block my good lighting,
it's just, ugh!

43:49.894 --> 43:51.864
Kidding, alright?
I love Kenny.

43:51.865 --> 43:53.363
He does breathe
real heavy though.

43:53.365 --> 43:54.695
Oh!

43:54.699 --> 43:56.929
Give me a hand.

43:56.935 --> 43:58.865
Alright. Just hang it right
here. Would you hold this?

43:58.870 --> 44:00.170
Sure.

44:03.140 --> 44:04.240
Oh!

44:06.043 --> 44:08.343
It's good.

44:08.346 --> 44:11.706
So are you excited to go on tour
after the album drops?

44:11.716 --> 44:13.216
Are you going any place
you haven't been?

44:13.218 --> 44:15.118
It's not nearly as fun
as it sounds.

44:15.120 --> 44:16.820
We're just never really anywhere
for long enough

44:16.821 --> 44:18.051
to enjoy, you know.

44:18.056 --> 44:19.386
Oh.

44:19.391 --> 44:21.421
So, why don't you take time

44:21.426 --> 44:23.886
when you're not touring
to travel?

44:23.895 --> 44:26.925
Honestly, in the little
free time I have, I, uh..

44:26.931 --> 44:28.699
Just like being home.

44:28.700 --> 44:30.200
Champagne problems, I know.

44:30.201 --> 44:32.836
No, I get it.

44:32.837 --> 44:34.837
Anyway, this house is amazing.

44:34.839 --> 44:37.339
If I lived here, I wanna be here
all the time, so..

44:37.342 --> 44:39.742
Denise said there is
a guitar room.

44:39.744 --> 44:40.784
- Oh, yeah.
- Hm.

44:40.785 --> 44:42.749
Come on, I'll show you.

44:45.716 --> 44:47.316
You play all these?

44:47.318 --> 44:49.348
I mean, what good's a guitar
if you don't.

44:49.354 --> 44:51.288
[laughs]

44:51.289 --> 44:53.859
You know,
I remember on your first album

44:53.860 --> 44:55.688
you used to play guitar
a lot more.

44:55.694 --> 44:56.834
Why don't you now?

44:56.835 --> 44:58.996
- Someone's a fan.
- Ow.

44:58.997 --> 45:02.697
After your first hit,
you were the talk of our town.

45:02.701 --> 45:05.939
A bunch of the girls used to
play "You're The One" on repeat.

45:05.940 --> 45:08.297
So I heard it 50 times a day.
I didn't have much choice.

45:08.306 --> 45:10.436
Well, nonetheless,
you just made me feel special

45:10.442 --> 45:12.309
so, uh..

45:12.310 --> 45:13.410
Thank you.

Thank you for this.

47:07.392 --> 47:09.560
It was really holiday-inspired.

47:09.561 --> 47:12.161
Oh, what can I say,
love inspires me.

47:12.163 --> 47:14.563
[Matty] Oh, "Love Inspires,"
that's, uh, that's your album.

47:14.566 --> 47:17.426
Oh, are you a fan, Mr. Sellers?

47:17.435 --> 47:20.595
Uh, uh, Allie, actually,
she-she told me that.

47:20.605 --> 47:23.465
Yeah, and I think Caleb
actually told me, right?

47:24.441 --> 47:27.211
Uh, no, I didn't.

47:27.212 --> 47:29.379
I think you did.
Didn't you?

47:29.380 --> 47:31.849
No, it wasn't me.
I didn't even know

47:31.850 --> 47:33.419
the name of your album actually.

47:33.420 --> 47:35.948
'Uh, to be honest, I don't know
the name of our own EP'

47:35.954 --> 47:37.521
but it's-it's cute.

47:37.522 --> 47:39.492
- Cheers to you, Carson.
- 'Thanks.'

47:39.493 --> 47:42.090
Cheers to a love-inspired meal

47:42.093 --> 47:44.193
and a love-inspired album, huh.

Cheers.

47:47.931 --> 47:50.367
[laughter]

47:50.368 --> 47:53.138
Okay, so who wants to watch
"Heavenly Valentine"

47:53.139 --> 47:54.367
in the screening room?

47:54.372 --> 47:57.072
I made a red velvet pie
too, what!

47:57.075 --> 47:59.875
Oh, I'm sorry, I am beat,
but I am gonna take advantage

47:59.878 --> 48:02.508
of the garden top and get some
work done before I go to bed.

48:02.513 --> 48:04.583
Save me a slice though,
would you?

48:04.584 --> 48:07.020
[Todd] 'And I am going
for a five-mile hike'

48:07.021 --> 48:09.118
up the hill in the morning,
so I need my sleep too.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.390
Thanks again for dinner.

48:10.391 --> 48:12.956
- Bye.
- See you in the morning.

48:12.957 --> 48:14.387
You know that
I actually love a good...

48:14.392 --> 48:18.192
Matty, we, actually,
have to get up early now

48:18.196 --> 48:20.526
to talk to Denise
about all the charity stuff

48:20.531 --> 48:23.100
so we should probably
hit the sack.

48:23.101 --> 48:24.401
- Yeah, uh, sorry. Sorry.
- Come on, guys.

48:24.402 --> 48:26.102
No one wants to watch with me?

48:26.104 --> 48:28.472
Maybe Caleb would.

48:28.473 --> 48:32.009
Actually, I can't stand
sappy chick flicks to be honest.

48:32.010 --> 48:34.240
Yeah, unless maybe you wanna
watch something like, um..

48:34.245 --> 48:37.445
Ooh, "My Deadly Valentine."

48:37.448 --> 48:39.248
Allie actually loves that movie.

48:39.250 --> 48:41.420
Oh, you have that Blu-ray
in your room.

48:41.421 --> 48:45.919
Oh, yeah, my nephew mailed it
to me from Seattle.

48:45.924 --> 48:48.358
He's a weird kid.

48:48.359 --> 48:49.629
I don't really care
what I watch.

48:49.630 --> 48:52.227
I just want fun and pie.

48:52.230 --> 48:53.697
You know what I think?

48:53.698 --> 48:55.528
I think you two should stay
and watch the movie

48:55.533 --> 48:58.633
because you worked so hard
over dinner which is delicious.

49:02.005 --> 49:03.505
[sighs]

49:04.541 --> 49:07.477
- Pretty good, huh?
- Hmm.

49:07.478 --> 49:10.008
Yeah, Carson is a gal
of many talents.

49:10.014 --> 49:12.452
Okay, seriously,
what is up with you

49:12.453 --> 49:14.480
trying to set me up with Carson?

49:14.485 --> 49:17.985
I just think you two will make
a really cute couple.

49:17.989 --> 49:20.589
But if we dated,
what would we watch?

49:20.591 --> 49:22.091
[laughs]

49:23.427 --> 49:25.996
I don't really like watching
sappy movies either.

49:25.997 --> 49:27.427
It's not that I don't like them

49:27.432 --> 49:30.732
I just... they make me cry..

49:31.735 --> 49:34.035
Feel emotional.

49:34.038 --> 49:37.107
Ew. I mean,
who would want all that?

49:37.108 --> 49:38.438
[laughs]

49:38.443 --> 49:40.143
Wow!

49:40.144 --> 49:42.179
Alright, a confession.

49:42.180 --> 49:43.750
That's why I can't
watch them either.

49:43.751 --> 49:46.618
"Notebook" did me in,
both sleeves soaked.

49:46.619 --> 49:48.217
[laughs]

49:48.219 --> 49:50.519
Well, then, I have a confession.

49:52.289 --> 49:54.719
I really like
"My Deadly Valentine."

49:54.726 --> 49:56.626
I knew it. I knew it.

49:56.627 --> 49:58.457
I know.

49:58.463 --> 50:01.033
Well, maybe you should invite me
over to watch it sometime.

50:06.403 --> 50:07.703
<i>Pinata?</i>

50:14.711 --> 50:18.181
[laughs]
You really like pie, huh?

50:18.182 --> 50:19.651
Ha-ha. Well, my mother says

50:19.652 --> 50:21.220
it will catch up to me in my 40s

50:21.221 --> 50:24.049
but by then I'll be married
with children, so..

50:24.055 --> 50:25.545
Won't be a prob
rockin' that dad bod, right?

50:25.556 --> 50:26.586
Yeah.

50:26.591 --> 50:28.091
[laughs]

50:28.092 --> 50:31.092
Uh, I think I'd make
a terrible mother.

50:31.095 --> 50:32.695
What, no, no way.

50:32.697 --> 50:34.427
Why would you say that?

50:34.432 --> 50:37.570
Oh, my mom didn't teach me
anything. She just..

50:37.571 --> 50:40.798
Would drop me off at music class
or dance class and then

50:40.805 --> 50:43.505
go off for a spa day, so.

50:43.508 --> 50:44.738
Oh.

50:53.550 --> 50:55.819
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

50:55.820 --> 50:58.090
I get cold easy.

step you don't exactly'

with falls.

51:21.379 --> 51:22.809
I'd hate to have to jump in
and save you.

51:22.814 --> 51:25.214
Uh, I can stay afloat just fine.

51:25.216 --> 51:26.676
Is that so?

51:26.684 --> 51:28.084
Why do you say that?

51:28.086 --> 51:30.186
I mean, come on,
with fair skin, you know

51:30.188 --> 51:31.818
I'd bet that was the first time

51:31.823 --> 51:34.723
you've actually been
sunny side up in ages.

51:34.725 --> 51:36.725
I go jogging every morning.

51:36.727 --> 51:39.257
I just wear
a very strong sunblock

51:39.263 --> 51:40.363
to keep me from getting burned.

51:40.364 --> 51:41.633
You do have a way of

51:41.634 --> 51:43.402
keeping from getting burned,
don't you?

51:43.403 --> 51:45.701
You're one to talk,
Mr. Mistrust.

51:45.703 --> 51:48.371
Alright.
Well, then you know what?

51:48.372 --> 51:51.212
Let's make this
a trust game, hmm.

51:52.342 --> 51:54.642
One arrow hit

51:54.645 --> 51:55.705
for each question.

51:55.713 --> 51:58.213
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

51:58.216 --> 52:01.376
I will open my heart to you

52:01.385 --> 52:04.715
if you open your heart to me.

52:05.722 --> 52:07.192
Fine.

52:08.425 --> 52:10.485
What do you wanna know?

52:10.495 --> 52:13.725
First time you fell in love.
Besides me, of course.

52:18.335 --> 52:19.765
[laughs]
Alright.

52:21.471 --> 52:24.241
Sophomore year of college.

52:24.641 --> 52:26.341

52:27.844 --> 52:30.354
I think he's a newscaster
in Philly now.

52:30.355 --> 52:32.278
Wife and two kids.

52:33.183 --> 52:35.353
First time you fell in love?

52:38.522 --> 52:40.322
I mean, besides my, ahem

Mrs. Fenton. She was, uh,
my first music coach.

52:46.797 --> 52:49.527
I was 11, and she was

52:49.534 --> 52:51.668
[whistles]
an LA goddess.

52:51.669 --> 52:53.869
It broke my heart to pieces

52:53.871 --> 52:57.371
when I asked her to leave
her husband, and she just left.

52:57.375 --> 52:58.835
She said I'd be
a heartbreaker one day.

52:58.843 --> 53:02.413
Hm, well, at least she got
that right.

53:03.747 --> 53:05.877
Last time you got
your heart broken?

53:07.951 --> 53:09.621
[exhales deeply]

53:15.358 --> 53:17.258
His name was Shep.

53:17.261 --> 53:19.361
He wasn't even my boyfriend.

53:19.363 --> 53:23.233
Actually, we were just
perpetually dating

53:23.700 --> 53:25.969
and..

53:25.970 --> 53:29.239
He only saw me
when he felt like it.

53:29.240 --> 53:31.740
So after six months

53:31.742 --> 53:33.842
I told him I was done.

53:33.844 --> 53:37.414
Wait, so he didn't dump you?

53:37.415 --> 53:38.905
No.

53:38.916 --> 53:42.246
But... he did break my heart.

53:43.453 --> 53:46.790
Wow, it's, um,
kind of depressing.

53:46.791 --> 53:48.921
Well, I already know
the last time

53:48.926 --> 53:51.556
you got your heart broken, so.

The one thing I don't know is

53:59.772 --> 54:01.938
did you cheat or didn't you?

54:01.939 --> 54:06.379
I mean, the tabloid said
you did, so, did you?

54:11.348 --> 54:12.778

- Oh, um..

54:12.783 --> 54:14.523

You know, she, um..

54:31.701 --> 54:35.801
She came from this pretty rich
family, but she still had

54:35.806 --> 54:38.336

54:38.342 --> 54:42.279
She, she kept 20s in this, uh,
pocket of her purse

54:42.280 --> 54:45.510
just to hand out to homeless
people on the streets.

54:45.516 --> 54:47.576
But why didn't she believe you

54:47.585 --> 54:49.585
when you said you didn't
cheat on her?

54:50.820 --> 54:52.989
If she loved you

54:52.990 --> 54:55.620
she should trust what you say.

54:55.626 --> 54:57.756
Yeah, well, she knew
I had cheated before

54:57.762 --> 55:00.002
when I was young and dumb and..

55:02.632 --> 55:04.872
And she thought I did it to her,
she was just so hurt.

55:06.603 --> 55:09.343
And she had already cheated
on me before in the past.

55:13.310 --> 55:16.850
When I proposed to her, she was
already with her publicist.

You so have me beat.

kind of felt like it was karma

just biting me back

55:27.625 --> 55:30.855
for all my years
of bad behavior before.

55:33.330 --> 55:35.460
Alright.

55:35.466 --> 55:37.526
- 'One more?'
- Yeah.

55:39.602 --> 55:40.872
Alright.

55:43.506 --> 55:45.736

55:48.478 --> 55:50.748

- Have you eaten yet?

Uh, no, I was waiting for you.

Oh, breakfast.

Come sit with us.

57:41.659 --> 57:45.129
Thank you. I'm so hungry
I could eat just about anything.

Oh, no, no, no, don't do that,
don't be rude.

So, what did I miss last night?

58:12.122 --> 58:15.822
Well, Matty and I cooked
in the kitchen last night

58:15.826 --> 58:18.856
and Caleb and Allie
did stuff out back.

58:18.863 --> 58:21.130
Oh? What kind of stuff?

58:21.131 --> 58:23.800
They set up the photo booth
and the <i>pinata</i>

58:23.801 --> 58:27.701

while they were playing outside.

58:27.705 --> 58:30.635
Hm, that's too bad,
I would've really enjoyed

58:30.641 --> 58:32.171
taking a crack out of that.

58:32.176 --> 58:34.136
Oh, you'll get your chance.

58:34.144 --> 58:35.582
We taped up that broken heart

58:35.583 --> 58:37.279
and it's ready to go
for round two.

58:37.281 --> 58:40.051
Perfect. I can't wait.

58:44.087 --> 58:46.147

You alright?

58:48.826 --> 58:50.826
It's really bad.

58:52.296 --> 58:54.256

- Tell him what?
- Tell him everything.

The lies, Vivian, the deceit.

I can't keep playing cupid
to him and Carson.

59:04.842 --> 59:06.982

It's killing me.

59:08.878 --> 59:12.048
Allie, you remember
when I first moved in?

59:12.049 --> 59:14.179
I had just been dumped
and kicked out.

59:14.184 --> 59:16.184
Highly verbally abusive Kate

59:16.186 --> 59:19.186
and her more verbally abusive
Yorkie.

59:19.189 --> 59:21.219
But do you remember when we were
going through those moving boxes

59:21.225 --> 59:22.685
and we found my yearbook?

59:22.693 --> 59:23.993
And we went through it
over a pizza?

59:23.994 --> 59:26.863
And we were looking
at pictures of me.

59:26.864 --> 59:30.034
Overweight, braces, acne.

59:31.868 --> 59:35.698
That's pretty much exactly
how I felt in that moment.

59:35.706 --> 59:38.966
That same ugly kid from school
that nobody wanted.

59:38.976 --> 59:40.076
- Matty..
- No, no, no, no.

But-but you..

and-and you said..

in those pics."

Confident, awkwardly cool
Mr. Matty Sellers.

59:51.055 --> 59:52.815

It's that smile.

59:55.225 --> 59:58.885
And in time,
you-you'll see him again too.

59:58.896 --> 01:00:01.056
Look, Caleb doesn't like Carson.

Confident, awkwardly cool
Miss Allie Rusch.

And all that fame and stuff,
none of that matters.

01:00:10.374 --> 01:00:12.244
He asked me last night
if he could trust me.

01:00:12.245 --> 01:00:14.382
They're gonna hate us.

Uh, right, uh, so, uh..

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:23.618
Uh, so, maybe-maybe
we-we-we shouldn't tell them.

01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:25.251
We have to.

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:28.315

How you were when we first
met in middle school.

01:01:02.126 --> 01:01:04.056
We used to ride our bikes
to the salon

I realized I wasn't

I was just a girl.
