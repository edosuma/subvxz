WEBVTT

00:15.541 --> 00:18.791
So, you don't remember
penetrating the victim's eye sockets

00:18.875 --> 00:20.500
with feminine hygiene products?

00:21.208 --> 00:23.791
No! I could never. I mean…

00:26.541 --> 00:30.875
-But it's all just a blank…
-Including your name?

00:33.166 --> 00:34.125
My name?

00:34.208 --> 00:37.458
You told the other officer that
you do not recall your name.

00:40.250 --> 00:41.083
I don't.

00:42.791 --> 00:44.541
Oh, my God. What is wrong with me?

00:51.083 --> 00:52.791
All right. Back to work.

00:54.791 --> 00:58.833
Homicide. Caught on tape.
Victim and perpetrator are both Jane Does.

00:58.916 --> 01:01.250
This one is our perpetrator?

01:01.333 --> 01:04.333
And she's claiming that
she has zero memory of what happened.

01:04.416 --> 01:07.416
But she walked in wearing men's clothes
with no ID.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.750
Amnesia. How convenient.

01:10.833 --> 01:14.666
Yes. But it's the fourth
of these unusual incidents this week.

01:14.750 --> 01:16.791
And the one other survivor,
our "Plaza Lady,"

01:16.875 --> 01:18.250
claims she lost her memory too.

01:18.333 --> 01:19.208
True.

01:19.958 --> 01:22.041
But this one looks like
she swapped her memory

01:22.125 --> 01:24.458
for years of elite combat training.

01:24.541 --> 01:28.833
Hey. You guys have been
keeping me here for I don't how long

01:28.916 --> 01:31.000
without medical attention, and I am--

01:31.083 --> 01:32.958
Much older than I thought.

01:34.791 --> 01:40.250
Because of the way you fight,
I thought 20, 25, tops.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.041
But now that I see you up close,

01:42.125 --> 01:45.625
you're definitely too old
to be doing someone else's dirty work.

01:45.708 --> 01:46.875
Excuse me?

01:47.458 --> 01:50.000
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

01:50.083 --> 01:52.250
Chief Inspector Ohana Charrón.

01:53.041 --> 01:55.416
I run criminal investigations for Europol.

01:55.500 --> 01:58.625
Which means I am quite familiar with one,

01:59.625 --> 02:00.708
Chauncey Lu.

02:02.333 --> 02:04.541
And this has his stench all over it.

02:06.500 --> 02:09.458
I really don't understand.

02:09.541 --> 02:10.541
Me either.

02:11.625 --> 02:14.833
I do not understand why
you will risk your life for a rogue agent

02:14.916 --> 02:16.750
who has been disavowed by the CIA.

02:16.833 --> 02:19.791
And who is, right now,
running an illegal operation

02:19.875 --> 02:21.916
in breach of international law.

02:22.500 --> 02:26.083
So, you don't know about Marseille?

02:27.833 --> 02:28.875
A year ago…

02:30.250 --> 02:33.125
five operatives died,
including two of my own.

02:33.708 --> 02:37.083
And all because Chauncey allowed himself
to be fooled by a double agent.

02:38.208 --> 02:40.541
That sounds really terrible. But I--

02:41.125 --> 02:42.500
Is he blackmailing you?

02:47.458 --> 02:48.916
Because whatever he has on you,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.500
this is your chance
to make it all go away.

02:52.083 --> 02:54.375
Your one and only chance.

02:58.833 --> 03:00.333
I can protect you.

03:01.416 --> 03:05.916
If you work with me.
I can get Chauncey off your back.

03:06.500 --> 03:07.875
For good. I promise.

03:13.208 --> 03:14.500
I had no choice.

03:17.375 --> 03:19.416
He threatened my daughter.

03:22.708 --> 03:25.208
So, are you in?

03:30.041 --> 03:30.875
Yeah.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.000
Let's take that motherfucker down.

03:48.083 --> 03:52.916
Now, what exactly is the nature
of your mission for Chauncey?

03:54.333 --> 03:57.208
First, I'm sorry, but do you think
I can get some clothes?

03:57.291 --> 03:59.750
They already collected evidence off of me.

03:59.833 --> 04:01.583
Bring her something to wear.

04:05.250 --> 04:07.625
And, uh, some privacy.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.250
Thank you.

04:29.666 --> 04:31.291
She gave up Chauncey's location.

04:31.375 --> 04:32.250
You got her to talk?

04:32.333 --> 04:35.166
I jogged her memory.
Get a tactical unit ready.

04:35.250 --> 04:36.166
Copy that.

04:37.208 --> 04:40.583
Attention, this is Miró.
I need a tactical unit now.

04:40.666 --> 04:43.958
God damn. Just give me a sec
to get Jenny back online.

04:45.166 --> 04:46.541
I just hope she can hang in there.

04:49.916 --> 04:52.083
Oh, shit. She ratted us out.

04:54.541 --> 04:56.750
You've got
a lot of fucking explaining to do.

05:21.333 --> 05:22.625
Coming!

05:24.875 --> 05:26.375
Coming!

05:28.041 --> 05:31.458
Wow. Su-Yin.
How did you know where I live?

05:31.541 --> 05:35.375
I'm the ambassador's son. You don't
think I have spies at my disposal?

05:35.458 --> 05:37.625
Oh, so, you had me followed?

05:38.541 --> 05:42.500
Yes. And they've dug up everything
there is to know

05:42.583 --> 05:44.916
about one "Anya Markova."

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
A B-minus student at Moscow Polytechnic.

05:48.583 --> 05:51.708
And once captain
of her Communist Youth Brigade.

05:51.791 --> 05:55.500
And why would you need to have
me checked out so thoroughly?

05:56.125 --> 05:58.416
You're not planning to propose, are you?

05:58.500 --> 06:02.291
I've been engaged to a descendent
of the Ming Dynasty since I was four.

06:06.791 --> 06:10.750
But you can have me for now.

06:22.625 --> 06:26.833
"You are formally invited to a gala

06:26.916 --> 06:29.958
in honor of the growing friendship

06:30.041 --> 06:33.708
between the People's Republic of China
and the Russian Federation." Wow.

06:34.541 --> 06:38.375
May that friendship grow and grow.

06:38.458 --> 06:40.333
But it says it's tonight.

06:40.416 --> 06:43.416
Where am I supposed to find
traditional Chinese attire?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.125
I figured you didn't have
a dress.

06:58.333 --> 06:59.541
Oh…

06:59.625 --> 07:01.666
I cannot accept

07:02.250 --> 07:08.250
such an expensive gift
from a foreign dignitary.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.500
I swear, if you don't come,

07:10.583 --> 07:12.625
Faina will cut off my cock.

07:12.708 --> 07:14.833
Well, we can't have that.

07:14.916 --> 07:18.583
Faina and I will need that cock tonight.

07:21.375 --> 07:23.125
Now, I better start getting ready.

07:23.208 --> 07:24.875
Leave. Leave. Your coat. Leave.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.833
The last remaining exemplar
from the Yaroslav Program

07:36.916 --> 07:38.833
is being held in
a safe inside the library.

07:39.958 --> 07:41.416
Located here.

07:45.083 --> 07:47.250
In the guest living quarters
on the second floor.

07:47.333 --> 07:50.083
You must recover it and deliver it.

07:50.875 --> 07:54.625
And then you will vacate the Embassy
with the Yaroslav exemplar.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.708
Give it here.

07:58.750 --> 08:03.166
You will exit in the same way you came in
as an invited guest.

08:03.250 --> 08:06.791
But if you are unable to deliver
the exemplar to your extraction team…

08:08.375 --> 08:11.375
then you must initiate the Omega Protocol.

08:13.208 --> 08:14.416
Without hesitation.

08:15.750 --> 08:18.416
This is everything we have worked for.

08:19.458 --> 08:20.541
Little bird.

08:23.541 --> 08:26.125
Now, let us make sure

08:27.125 --> 08:32.583
that little fool
cannot keep his hands off of you.

08:43.583 --> 08:46.375
I know what Ohana
must have told you about Marseille.

08:46.458 --> 08:48.958
The double agent.
The whole fucking nightmare.

08:49.041 --> 08:52.125
But I swear to you, Jenny,
it's not the truth.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.583
At least, not all of it.

08:54.666 --> 08:58.291
That double agent… Her name was Rose.

08:59.875 --> 09:03.916
And I know for a fact that
she'd never have betrayed me or my team.

09:06.750 --> 09:10.833
Just because you were fucking her
you believed she was pure as snow?

09:10.916 --> 09:12.458
She was my fiancée.

09:13.958 --> 09:15.083
We grew up together.

09:15.875 --> 09:18.083
We joined the Air Force
and the CIA together.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.291
I knew her better than I know myself.

09:22.125 --> 09:23.375
What happened?

09:23.458 --> 09:26.458
Rose was our embedded asset
inside a hate group

09:26.541 --> 09:29.000
that we believed
was planning a terrorist attack.

09:30.416 --> 09:31.583
A group like Los Jinetes?

09:31.666 --> 09:32.791
Same exact model.

09:33.916 --> 09:35.666
And just like the Caleros,

09:36.458 --> 09:40.041
they had a silent partner
financing their operation.

09:41.166 --> 09:42.750
Not fucking Gideon?

09:42.833 --> 09:45.000
You told me
you'd never met this guy until now.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.625
No, I said I had no intel on him.

09:46.708 --> 09:48.041
-Ugh.
-And I don't.

09:48.125 --> 09:50.875
I wish I really knew
what to believe after all your lies.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.458
-You're one to talk, Jenny.
-This isn't about me for once.

09:55.041 --> 09:56.125
Then just listen.

09:57.458 --> 09:59.833
Gideon was always our primary target.

09:59.916 --> 10:03.083
And we got so fucking close
to nailing that son of a bitch.

10:03.166 --> 10:04.125
But then, Rose…

10:07.083 --> 10:09.875
Rose said that
she had Gideon locked down for us.

10:10.875 --> 10:14.416
That we could intercept him before
the group could carry out their attack.

10:14.500 --> 10:18.541
But when we arrived, Gideon wasn't there.

10:20.375 --> 10:21.208
Just Rose.

10:23.625 --> 10:25.875
And she was the one
who triggered the bomb.

10:29.958 --> 10:35.083
Afterwards, I thought…
I knew it couldn't really have been her.

10:35.166 --> 10:39.041
It had to be someone else.
Someone acting like her. Someone…

10:41.166 --> 10:42.500
Someone like you.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.666
That's why you came looking for me?

10:48.708 --> 10:49.583
Yes.

10:50.958 --> 10:53.041
But now, after everything we've seen,

10:53.125 --> 10:56.375
I think someone
actually took control of Rose's mind.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.875
Like Lidia. And the others.

11:06.916 --> 11:10.125
It wasn't Rose that lured
my team into a trap. It was Gideon.

11:13.416 --> 11:14.250
Okay.

11:17.250 --> 11:19.500
But if you're not working
for the CIA anymore,

11:19.583 --> 11:22.500
then who the hell is paying for all this?

11:23.375 --> 11:24.208
I am.

11:25.291 --> 11:26.416
Family trust.

11:28.125 --> 11:31.666
Come on. You expect me to believe that
a trust fund kid went into civil duty?

11:32.625 --> 11:35.333
Truth is, it's generations of blood money.

11:36.333 --> 11:39.708
From elite douchebags
ripping off the world, creating wealth.

11:39.791 --> 11:41.750
Trying to punch
your ticket to heaven then?

11:41.833 --> 11:43.250
Call it whatever you want.

11:44.625 --> 11:46.000
But this is personal for me.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.000
And I will not stop
until I clear Rose's name.

11:51.083 --> 11:55.916
Sure. But you expect me
to risk my life and my family

11:56.000 --> 11:57.416
for your personal vendetta?

11:57.500 --> 12:01.208
I'm asking you… to help me.

12:02.583 --> 12:04.666
Help me put Gideon behind bars

12:04.750 --> 12:07.750
so that no more innocent people
have to die.

12:07.833 --> 12:09.291
I can't do it without you.

12:15.375 --> 12:16.875
Well, we still have a problem.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.666
That footage from last night.

12:19.750 --> 12:22.375
It's only a matter of time before
this CI Charron tracks me down.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.291
I'll take care of that.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.250
And this Rose?

12:33.416 --> 12:36.500
What happened?
She died in the explosion too?

12:38.250 --> 12:39.291
No.

12:41.416 --> 12:42.333
I had to…

12:43.666 --> 12:48.583
I had to try to stop her. So, I shot her.

12:51.833 --> 12:52.833
I killed her.

13:19.958 --> 13:22.166
I think someone
messed with Claire's skate.

13:23.041 --> 13:26.666
There was no way the blade
could have been that loose. Like…

13:27.500 --> 13:29.916
And it's not like
it could've just happened.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.625
And Becca's being so weird.

13:32.708 --> 13:36.041
And she was just so sus when Claire fell.

13:36.125 --> 13:38.625
And coach was so mad. And then--

13:39.625 --> 13:41.458
Shit! Becca.

13:41.541 --> 13:43.416
How long have you been lurking there?

13:44.250 --> 13:45.125
I wasn't.

13:46.458 --> 13:47.833
Look, can we just talk for a sec?

13:51.250 --> 13:53.500
Maddie, please. You have to listen to me.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.166
I would never do anything
to hurt Claire or anyone else.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.333
I just can't trust you anymore.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.916
Look, I really think that maybe

14:04.000 --> 14:07.875
you should just go back to your own room

14:08.458 --> 14:12.500
and stop making the rest of us
feel so uncomfortable.

14:32.291 --> 14:33.958
Try something like, uh,

14:34.041 --> 14:36.166
"I can't stop
thinking about you inside me."

14:36.250 --> 14:39.000
Come on, man. That's nasty.
She's a classy girl.

14:39.083 --> 14:41.958
Plus, I already said,
<i>"No te puedo olvidar, papichulo."</i>

14:42.041 --> 14:42.875
What?

14:42.958 --> 14:44.833
You guys role-playing again?

14:44.916 --> 14:48.416
Man, your man Felipe isn't answering
none of Sara Fonte's sexy texts.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.875
And without him, we can't get to Gideon.

14:50.958 --> 14:54.166
Well, I doubt Sara
is Felipe's top priority right now.

14:54.250 --> 14:58.500
After last night's bloodbath,
shit's heating up. Security is tight.

14:59.708 --> 15:01.666
Then we need another way in. Fast.

15:02.166 --> 15:05.416
We have one. Felipe's sister, Inés.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.666
-Hmm.
-I know exactly where she is.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.666
Just let me check on Becca first.

15:11.750 --> 15:12.791
Okay.

15:18.541 --> 15:19.791
Jenny, wait.

15:22.333 --> 15:23.625
Back at the bathhouse…

15:24.750 --> 15:27.083
why didn't you turn on me
when you had the chance?

15:27.166 --> 15:28.750
How do you know I didn't?

15:30.208 --> 15:31.375
I guess I don't.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.166
Then I guess
you're gonna have to trust me.

15:44.666 --> 15:45.500
Becca?

15:48.625 --> 15:50.208
Becca, you okay?

15:51.291 --> 15:54.541
Honey… Honey, what is it?

15:55.708 --> 15:57.250
-What's wrong?

16:00.083 --> 16:02.166
Did something happen
with one of the girls?

16:07.375 --> 16:09.000
Baby, please talk to me. Please.

16:10.291 --> 16:14.000
I got a message from Coach Arbaugh
about Claire's accident.

16:15.416 --> 16:17.208
It's terrible she won't be able to compete

16:17.291 --> 16:19.333
and I'm sure everyone is really upset.

16:19.416 --> 16:20.750
Suddenly, you care?

16:21.333 --> 16:23.625
About me and the team and fucking Claire?

16:23.708 --> 16:25.666
You literally have no idea what's going on

16:25.750 --> 16:27.666
because you haven't been
around for any of it.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.166
-What? I--
-And now I know why.

16:29.250 --> 16:30.791
What are you talking about?

16:31.833 --> 16:33.875
You asked for space. I gave it to you.

16:33.958 --> 16:35.041
I saw you, Mom.

16:35.708 --> 16:38.125
I saw the reason you've been
sneaking around and lying to me.

16:38.208 --> 16:40.333
So, just cut
this Oscar-winning performance.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.041
Whatever it is you think you saw--

16:42.125 --> 16:44.458
Stop trying to gaslight me,
making me think that I'm crazy

16:44.541 --> 16:46.666
and I didn't see what I fucking saw
with my own eyes.

16:46.750 --> 16:49.791
I learned about it in health class
and it's abuse, okay?

16:50.458 --> 16:52.916
Becca, what has gotten into you?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.583
No, Mom.

16:54.666 --> 16:57.958
What has gotten into you
is the random cock of a total stranger.

16:58.041 --> 17:00.291
I saw you coming out of his room,
all glowing and gross.

17:00.375 --> 17:02.708
Don't you ever talk to me like that!

17:07.541 --> 17:09.583
I am so sorry.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.333
-Becca, no.

17:17.791 --> 17:21.041
You were so mad
when I knocked this tooth out in training.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.041
But now, look how useful it is.

17:26.125 --> 17:28.750
I do not expect that
you will need to resort to this.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.375
But cyanide is quick.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.541
And painless. Relatively.

17:35.625 --> 17:36.541
Stand up.

17:38.250 --> 17:39.250
Lift up your skirt.

17:41.208 --> 17:45.125
Your instruments
for opening the safe are on the right.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.916
On your left, your weapons.

17:51.166 --> 17:55.041
Which, again, hopefully,
you will not need to employ.

17:55.125 --> 17:57.250
And of course, your other weapon.

17:58.375 --> 17:59.958
Did you put in your diaphragm?

18:00.041 --> 18:01.083
Yes.

18:02.333 --> 18:03.250
Just remember…

18:03.333 --> 18:04.916
Omega Protocol. I won't forget.

18:11.541 --> 18:13.500
My little bird.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.791
Maybe I will marry you after all.

18:47.875 --> 18:50.958
-If I get half of your inheritance.

18:53.208 --> 18:56.916
But first we will have
to get rid of these two.

18:57.541 --> 18:59.958
That shouldn't be too hard
by the looks of them.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.291
Mother,
may I present Anya Markova.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.875
Anya, meet my mother, Zhang Min.

19:06.541 --> 19:09.041
I am a deep admirer
of your culture.

19:09.125 --> 19:12.083
You are familiar
with proper etiquette.

19:12.166 --> 19:13.583
Show-off.

19:13.666 --> 19:15.458
And this is my father, Li Jun.

19:15.541 --> 19:19.458
It is an honor to meet
such an important, powerful man.

19:20.625 --> 19:24.416
Su-Yin, you've truly found
the flower among Russian women.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.000
Thank you.

19:36.833 --> 19:39.250
That was the worst of it.
I swear.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.541
As much as I adore this dress,

19:44.708 --> 19:47.083
I'd love to see you out of it.

19:49.875 --> 19:51.166
But where is Faina?

19:51.250 --> 19:53.583
She and her dad have to stay upstairs.

19:54.291 --> 19:55.333
But don't worry.

19:55.416 --> 19:57.458
We'll join her up there soon enough.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.833
Do not forget what you came to do.

20:04.916 --> 20:06.375
You are not Cinderella at the ball.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.416
Just this, please.

21:29.833 --> 21:30.708
<i>Gracias.</i>

21:41.583 --> 21:43.750
Never run
from the scene of a crime.

21:43.833 --> 21:44.750
Excuse me?

21:45.500 --> 21:47.208
You should strut…

21:48.291 --> 21:50.083
…as if you have done nothing wrong.

21:51.208 --> 21:53.500
Okay. Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:53.583 --> 21:56.833
<i>Vale.</i> I saw what you did.

21:57.708 --> 21:58.541
Oops.

21:58.625 --> 21:59.958
Impressive.

22:00.708 --> 22:03.000
But you have much to learn.

22:03.083 --> 22:04.083
Keep walking.

22:05.333 --> 22:07.041
Don't worry. I will tell no one.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.083
But, of course… I want something from you.

22:11.750 --> 22:14.166
Want something? Like what?

22:15.208 --> 22:16.375
Something like…

22:17.666 --> 22:19.125
I show you around.

22:19.958 --> 22:21.208
Why would you want to do that?

22:24.833 --> 22:26.416
I'm sorry, I don't--

22:26.500 --> 22:28.833
I like the girls who don't give a fuck.

22:28.916 --> 22:30.708
Understand? Like you.

22:35.208 --> 22:39.375
Like you. I take you where
you can wear that sexy little dress.

22:40.875 --> 22:41.750
Come on.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.583
Come on. Come on, you say yes.

22:50.666 --> 22:51.541
Where?

22:53.458 --> 22:55.708
It's top secret.

23:07.375 --> 23:08.416
<i>Hola.</i>

23:09.625 --> 23:13.791
I would like to speak with
Chief Inspector Ohana Charron, please.

23:13.875 --> 23:15.416
Tell her Chauncey Lew is here.

23:17.083 --> 23:19.541
<i>Lew, Chauncey.</i>
<i>Special Operations Agent.</i>

23:19.625 --> 23:22.041
<i>CIA. Status, disavowed.</i>

23:33.833 --> 23:36.666
So, you decided to turn yourself in?

23:36.750 --> 23:43.250
No, but I thought you might need
somebody to talk to after what happened.

23:43.333 --> 23:45.041
And what exactly happened?

23:45.125 --> 23:46.208
Shall we review?

23:46.291 --> 23:50.250
A woman walked out of custody as you

23:51.166 --> 23:53.833
and your own team
couldn't tell the difference.

23:59.541 --> 24:02.083
Who the hell is she? Or what is she?

24:02.166 --> 24:04.041
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?

24:05.166 --> 24:06.208
If you've gone crazy.

24:07.625 --> 24:10.125
Well, welcome to my world.

24:13.458 --> 24:15.541
Remember how
you didn't believe me in Marseille?

24:16.541 --> 24:20.166
When I said Rose wasn't herself?

24:20.791 --> 24:22.250
Well, maybe you believe me now.

24:24.166 --> 24:25.208
I am listening.

24:25.291 --> 24:27.666
Gideon is here in Madrid.

24:27.750 --> 24:29.458
Wreaking all this havoc.

24:29.541 --> 24:31.625
And he's planning something even worse.

24:31.708 --> 24:32.833
Planning what?

24:32.916 --> 24:35.625
I don't know. But I'll tell you
when I have the details.

24:35.708 --> 24:40.250
Until then, I need you
to leave me and my asset alone.

24:40.333 --> 24:42.083
Your asset?

24:44.916 --> 24:49.333
If we're successful,
you and your team get to be the heroes

24:49.416 --> 24:53.875
for bringing down the top financier
of right wing terrorism in Europe.

24:53.958 --> 24:56.166
You think you can come in here
with your demands

24:56.250 --> 24:58.625
and offer me nothing
but promises in return?

25:01.166 --> 25:02.458
Zoya Kotova.

25:03.208 --> 25:06.083
That is the name of the woman
that my asset killed for you.

25:06.166 --> 25:10.708
Part of a mercenary group of assassins
known as the Jackals.

25:10.791 --> 25:15.000
You'll probably get another promotion
for ending her reign of terror.

25:15.083 --> 25:16.541
So, you're welcome.

25:17.291 --> 25:23.125
But, I'm gonna need every copy of that
bathhouse security footage that you have.

25:26.375 --> 25:27.208
Fine.

25:28.458 --> 25:30.791
If you get me my suit back.

25:31.375 --> 25:32.333
It's Chanel.

25:34.083 --> 25:35.000
I understand.

25:49.458 --> 25:51.750
Holy Mary, mother of God.

25:51.833 --> 25:53.833
Please hear a mother's prayer.

25:54.375 --> 25:58.416
Extend your grace over my son, Ramón,
that is far away from home.

25:59.541 --> 26:01.583
Please keep my dear boy safe.

26:01.666 --> 26:04.000
Holy Mary, mother of God.

26:04.083 --> 26:06.333
Please hear a mother's prayer.

26:07.083 --> 26:09.833
Extend your grace over my son, Ramón.

26:10.416 --> 26:11.250
No, Uncle--

26:13.125 --> 26:16.625
And your mother should never hear
about this embarrassment.

26:16.708 --> 26:18.416
…that is far away from home.

26:18.500 --> 26:22.125
Please keep my dear boy safe
and hasten his return.

26:23.875 --> 26:24.708
Amen.

26:26.333 --> 26:29.833
Sara? What a surprise to see you.

26:31.375 --> 26:33.500
You said this was your favorite church,

26:34.500 --> 26:37.125
so I thought I'd come
light a candle for my husband.

26:38.458 --> 26:39.791
I hope I'm not intruding.

26:39.875 --> 26:42.250
No, not at all.
On the contrary.

26:43.958 --> 26:47.750
You know,
I don't mean to embarrass you,

26:47.833 --> 26:49.250
but I was thinking,

26:50.250 --> 26:54.416
if only Felipe would settle down
with a kind woman like you, Sara.

26:54.500 --> 26:56.916
But he is so obsessed with his work.

26:57.916 --> 27:00.166
He doesn't make time for happiness.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.416
I hope I didn't offend your brother,

27:03.500 --> 27:06.666
but he hasn't been returning my messages.

27:06.750 --> 27:10.166
No. Really.
As I said, he's just distracted.

27:11.166 --> 27:14.208
He has some business associate
coming to the estate today,

27:14.291 --> 27:17.708
and he's very anxious
for everything to be perfect.

27:18.333 --> 27:22.375
Well, based on yesterday's feast,
I'm sure it'll be great.

27:23.166 --> 27:27.375
But there is so much to do.
I barely had time to slip away.

27:27.458 --> 27:28.541
Hmm.

27:28.625 --> 27:30.833
Why don't you come and help,
if you are free?

27:31.833 --> 27:34.708
Felipe likes a woman
who knows her way around the kitchen.

27:34.791 --> 27:36.625
I wouldn't like to intrude.

27:36.708 --> 27:39.958
Believe me,
he will be glad to see you.

27:40.041 --> 27:44.000
And if he isn't, at least you and I
will have a good time.

27:44.083 --> 27:45.125
Hmm?

28:00.208 --> 28:02.458
Why aren't you
eating your caviar?

28:03.250 --> 28:04.958
I'm hungry for something else.

28:06.708 --> 28:09.083
We have to wait
until my parents are drunk.

28:09.166 --> 28:10.708
Or they'll notice.

28:12.833 --> 28:15.125
<i>Stop wasting time</i>
<i>on this infant.</i>

28:15.208 --> 28:17.541
<i>You need to get upstairs right now.</i>

28:20.458 --> 28:24.708
Or maybe two girls are too much for you,
after all? We can call it off.

28:24.791 --> 28:27.916
No. I'll handle it.

28:31.416 --> 28:32.416
Then follow my lead.

28:34.750 --> 28:36.041
Oh, no. My dress.

28:36.125 --> 28:39.583
Come, I'll help you clean up.

28:39.666 --> 28:40.958
Excuse me.

28:55.625 --> 28:57.208
No guests upstairs.

28:57.291 --> 29:01.125
Bro, help a comrade out.
Do me a favor. Please?

29:04.416 --> 29:05.291
Go ahead.

29:08.750 --> 29:09.625
Thank you.

29:19.583 --> 29:23.416
Are you going to let me and Faina
have our way with you tonight?

29:25.500 --> 29:27.791
Yes. Of course.

29:27.875 --> 29:29.791
-Definitely.
-Hmm.

29:29.875 --> 29:33.541
Are you going to let us use your body

29:33.625 --> 29:37.166
to fulfill our most unspeakable desires?

29:38.708 --> 29:39.541
Yeah.

29:40.541 --> 29:42.583
And where exactly is Faina now?

29:42.666 --> 29:44.958
Uh, the second bedroom on the left.

29:46.750 --> 29:49.500
And will you wait here
like an obedient boy

29:49.583 --> 29:52.625
while I go and get your
other mistress ready for you?

29:54.083 --> 29:56.416
Yes, mistress.

30:03.416 --> 30:05.750
Don't go anywhere, okay?

30:46.416 --> 30:47.250
I'm in.

30:47.833 --> 30:50.166
<i>You still have time.</i>
<i>If you hurry.</i>

31:33.125 --> 31:34.375
It worked.

31:35.666 --> 31:37.000
<i>Good job, birdie.</i>

31:39.208 --> 31:40.375
But it's not here.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.833
Yaroslav. It's gone.

31:44.500 --> 31:45.916
<i>Repeat your message.</i>

31:53.875 --> 31:55.708
This is incredible.

31:56.416 --> 32:00.833
This business associate must be
quite special for such royal treatment.

32:00.916 --> 32:03.750
<i>It could be the King of Spain</i>
<i>himself, for all I know.</i>

32:04.375 --> 32:07.916
<i>My brothers never tell me anything</i>
<i>about the family business.</i>

32:08.750 --> 32:12.375
As if my fragile female brain
would implode.

32:14.041 --> 32:17.625
I tell you, it was all different
when Eduardo was here.

32:17.708 --> 32:18.541
Inés…

32:20.708 --> 32:24.458
Sara? What are you doing here?

32:25.333 --> 32:28.041
I'm so sorry to barge in. I just--

32:28.125 --> 32:31.625
I saw her at church
and begged her to come help me cook.

32:32.458 --> 32:34.708
Or would you rather that
I slave away alone?

32:36.875 --> 32:39.000
No. Of course not.

32:39.541 --> 32:42.541
<i>You are always welcome in our home, Sara.</i>

32:47.250 --> 32:50.791
It is a pleasure to see you
and my sister getting along so well.

32:50.875 --> 32:53.666
Yes. We have a lot in common.

32:54.416 --> 32:57.166
Come on, Felipe. Leave us, please.

32:57.250 --> 32:59.375
We will be bringing out
the food right away.

32:59.458 --> 33:00.750
Okay.

33:00.833 --> 33:03.958
By the way, my guest is here.

33:07.291 --> 33:08.416
I don't know, man.

33:09.208 --> 33:11.458
You don't think that look says,
"I'm totally not buying

33:11.541 --> 33:14.000
that this lady just happens to
run into my sister at church

33:14.083 --> 33:17.666
and get herself invited to make lunch
for me and my very special guest"?

33:17.750 --> 33:21.375
No. I think he's just pissed that
his sister is playing <i>yenta.</i>

33:23.750 --> 33:25.041
Wait, hold it. What's <i>"yenta"?</i>

33:25.125 --> 33:26.958
<i>His Royal Highness arrives early?</i>

33:27.541 --> 33:31.791
Nothing is ready.
The soup is burning and the fish is raw.

33:32.375 --> 33:35.916
Do you know what I'm saying?
I hope they choke on food.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.500
Let me take this in.

33:37.583 --> 33:38.541
<i>Gracias.</i>

33:39.250 --> 33:41.166
And I will take this in.

33:42.458 --> 33:44.166
Follow me, please, honey.

33:44.666 --> 33:46.583
I'll show you where it goes.

33:46.666 --> 33:48.166
Some sources have changed.

33:48.250 --> 33:51.708
And so, we require a brand-new device.

33:52.291 --> 33:55.458
With this alternative specifications.

33:55.541 --> 33:57.333
And that is your problem,
not mine.

33:58.166 --> 34:01.666
I already delivered a device
built to your original specifications.

34:01.750 --> 34:04.958
You must pay me in full before we can
discuss any further business.

34:05.041 --> 34:06.875
I'm fed up with your tone.

34:07.833 --> 34:10.666
Remember, Damían, this is for Spain.

34:10.750 --> 34:12.416
Country's counting on us.

34:12.500 --> 34:14.416
I do not give a damn
about politics.

34:14.500 --> 34:15.500
Listen to me.

34:15.583 --> 34:19.000
<i>Gideon will not be pleased</i>
<i>to hear of this difficulty.</i>

34:19.083 --> 34:21.791
<i>And Gideon is not someone</i>
<i>you want to displease.</i>

34:22.375 --> 34:24.500
What is that? Is that a threat?

34:24.583 --> 34:26.708
I don't know. What the hell do you think?

34:26.791 --> 34:27.833
Felipe…

34:29.375 --> 34:30.583
Come on, gentlemen, please.

34:30.666 --> 34:33.625
Let us mind our manners
in front of the lady.

34:34.375 --> 34:37.000
Sorry for the interruption.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.500
Sara.
Allow me to introduce you

34:40.583 --> 34:42.250
to our colleague, Señor Damían Abasolo.

34:47.166 --> 34:48.250
It's a pleasure.

34:48.333 --> 34:51.125
Damían, this is <i>Señora</i> Sara Fonte.

34:52.208 --> 34:55.333
I would invite you to stay
but we are discussing business matters

34:55.416 --> 34:57.166
that I think you will find quite boring.

34:57.250 --> 34:58.125
Yes.

34:59.666 --> 35:02.416
Before I go,
I would love to serve <i>Señor</i> Abasolo

35:02.500 --> 35:05.083
a slice of <i>jamón de pata negra.</i>

35:06.125 --> 35:09.541
Inés was just telling me that
this <i>El Manchado de Jabugo,</i>

35:09.625 --> 35:12.708
an Iberian pig raised free

35:12.791 --> 35:16.000
eating only acorns of the holm oaks.

35:16.083 --> 35:19.041
By Spanish tradition,
it takes six years to cure.

35:23.083 --> 35:25.583
But it will sell for over 4,000 euros.

35:26.708 --> 35:27.833
Well worth it, no?

35:32.333 --> 35:34.166
Even more so from your hands.

35:34.250 --> 35:36.500
Yet some things
are more valuable than money.

35:37.916 --> 35:43.541
Like preserving our country's traditions
against attacks from outsiders.

35:44.375 --> 35:47.750
Outsiders who would love to see
our culture and history destroyed.

35:47.833 --> 35:49.208
Sara, there's no need to--

35:49.291 --> 35:51.458
I understand
I know very little about these matters.

35:53.666 --> 35:57.291
But I do believe each of us has a duty

35:58.041 --> 36:00.625
to participate in the struggle
for our country's future.

36:02.250 --> 36:05.333
And to be on the front lines of this…

36:06.291 --> 36:09.208
Well,
that is just the highest honor

36:09.291 --> 36:11.916
that any man or woman can achieve.

36:15.708 --> 36:18.041
That's some Heil Hitler shit right there.

36:20.458 --> 36:21.291
Uh-huh.

36:22.125 --> 36:27.416
I did not realize your cause
had such eloquent supporters.

36:27.500 --> 36:28.750
Neither did I.

36:30.041 --> 36:32.208
So, can we count on you, Damían?

36:34.791 --> 36:36.958
Fine. I will do it.

36:37.541 --> 36:40.541
I only hope you will be here
when I return with the finished product.

36:41.208 --> 36:44.791
Of course, if Felipe permits.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.041
To Sara Fonte.

36:52.333 --> 36:55.416
Who has reminded us
what we are fighting for.

37:03.333 --> 37:06.500
But you don't need
the fake American smile.

37:07.375 --> 37:09.958
A serious face is more sexy.

37:10.625 --> 37:12.958
Like an angry Russian model.

37:15.041 --> 37:17.291
Now, we both. Together.

37:23.708 --> 37:24.541
Let me see.

37:27.958 --> 37:29.250
You have a good eye.

37:29.333 --> 37:31.708
<i>Hombre,</i> I spotted you today.

37:34.166 --> 37:38.041
Listen. Why did you
choose this ice skating?

37:39.750 --> 37:40.958
God. I guess…

37:42.583 --> 37:44.458
Well, it was kind of
because of my best friend.

37:45.625 --> 37:48.958
Then, it turns out,
she wasn't really my friend anyway, so…

37:50.625 --> 37:51.541
I don't know.

37:52.833 --> 37:55.916
But you are very good, no?

37:56.000 --> 37:57.750
Yeah, I could be. If I really tried.

37:58.666 --> 38:03.166
But I just never wanted
to steal her limelight, I guess.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Then…

38:06.125 --> 38:09.625
You hold back
to let your not-real-friend feel better?

38:10.333 --> 38:11.166
Yeah.

38:12.041 --> 38:15.541
Yeah, I guess that's pretty… <i>estúpido.</i>
Or <i>estúpida?</i>

38:17.500 --> 38:19.000
Look at this.

38:19.083 --> 38:20.166
This tattoo.

38:20.750 --> 38:22.750
It means, I rely on me.

38:22.833 --> 38:25.208
Alone… My strength.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.125
Sorry, I--

38:29.208 --> 38:32.083
Believe in no one else. Only you.

38:37.541 --> 38:38.541
What about this one?

38:40.000 --> 38:44.333
I take what I want. When I want.

38:46.916 --> 38:47.833
And these?

38:48.833 --> 38:50.875
One for each time I kill.

38:52.208 --> 38:54.125
Liar. You haven't killed anybody.

38:56.125 --> 38:57.041
Of course…

38:58.416 --> 39:01.250
Of course not, but…

39:02.875 --> 39:05.958
It's good to be
a little scary.

39:08.791 --> 39:09.625
No?

39:11.375 --> 39:15.000
Yeah. I'm beginning to figure that out.

39:20.083 --> 39:21.875
Hey, would you do something for me?

39:23.458 --> 39:26.750
Anything you ask. I will do.

39:33.416 --> 39:34.291
You…

39:36.250 --> 39:37.583
You surprised me today.

39:40.666 --> 39:42.166
I hope I didn't upset you.

39:42.250 --> 39:45.583
No. I needed that deal to go well today.

39:45.666 --> 39:47.208
And you made it happen.

39:47.291 --> 39:48.458
You were amazing.

39:50.458 --> 39:52.500
I wanted you to know how I feel.

39:52.583 --> 39:53.583
Sara…

39:55.958 --> 39:58.958
I am involved
in a very dangerous enterprise.

40:00.666 --> 40:03.500
And I do not want to drag you into it.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.583
I want to be a part of this fight.

40:10.083 --> 40:11.833
Be the kind of woman you deserve.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.708
Then we shall see each other again soon.

40:21.791 --> 40:23.666
-But we're together now.

40:24.375 --> 40:27.500
And I'm meeting an old school friend
for drinks at the hotel.

40:28.875 --> 40:29.833
<i>Lo siento.</i>

40:32.958 --> 40:35.708
Okay. Okay.

40:37.750 --> 40:39.166
My driver will take you.

40:41.666 --> 40:42.500
<i>Gracias.</i>

40:59.791 --> 41:00.625
<i>Gracias.</i>

41:01.500 --> 41:04.125
<i>You'll be glad to hear</i>
<i>Becca finally texted me back.</i>

41:04.791 --> 41:05.625
Wow.

41:05.708 --> 41:06.916
She's fine, don't worry,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.666
but she's gonna stay out
a little later to clear her head.

41:09.750 --> 41:11.291
She sounds so grown up.

41:12.583 --> 41:13.458
Tell her I love her.

41:13.541 --> 41:15.916
Already did. I know how to mom.

41:16.833 --> 41:19.958
That was a big risk you took in there
with Damían Abasolo.

41:20.041 --> 41:22.041
<i>It could've gone south in a big way.</i>

41:23.000 --> 41:24.333
Yeah, but it didn't.

41:24.416 --> 41:26.208
<i>Abasolo sure likes you, though.</i>

41:26.291 --> 41:29.125
Damn. Especially when
you got all Franco on 'em.

41:29.208 --> 41:32.958
Yeah, well, most men love strong women.

41:33.583 --> 41:35.291
They just don't always know it.

41:36.291 --> 41:37.875
<i>See you back at our other hotel?</i>

42:17.875 --> 42:19.541
She definitely knows this guy.

42:20.041 --> 42:22.208
I suspected
the second they saw each other.

42:22.291 --> 42:25.416
Surprise, surprise. The spy's got secrets.

42:26.375 --> 42:27.916
I thought you were dead.

42:29.666 --> 42:32.750
I didn't know if you'd remember
this place after all these years.

42:32.833 --> 42:34.250
It has changed a lot.

42:35.458 --> 42:36.500
So have you, Dmitri.

42:39.208 --> 42:40.916
Or is it Damían now?

42:41.416 --> 42:42.958
You are as beautiful as ever.

42:46.208 --> 42:49.875
I looked for you.
I looked for years after you disappeared.

42:51.166 --> 42:52.500
I didn't wanna be found.

42:56.166 --> 42:58.125
I would've given my life to protect you.

43:01.416 --> 43:03.166
But you couldn't protect me.

43:03.666 --> 43:04.875
My dear Dmitri.

43:05.833 --> 43:06.916
Not from her.

43:08.791 --> 43:12.666
That's why
I had to start all over.

43:15.291 --> 43:17.916
So, who is this new person you've created?

43:18.458 --> 43:21.583
Is she married? Does she have children?

43:22.750 --> 43:25.000
The Anya I knew wanted those things.
I remember.

43:25.083 --> 43:26.791
I don't have time for that right now.

43:27.333 --> 43:31.708
Tell me,
why are you working for these animals?

43:31.791 --> 43:33.875
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

43:33.958 --> 43:36.458
but I do not always have
a choice in clientele.

43:37.916 --> 43:38.958
I need money.

43:40.708 --> 43:42.791
And there are the pressures, as you know.

43:42.875 --> 43:44.166
Who's paying you?

43:45.250 --> 43:47.375
Who's this "Gideon" I keep hearing about?

43:47.916 --> 43:50.875
I don't know anything about Gideon.
I don't want to know.

43:50.958 --> 43:52.875
This question can get me killed.

43:54.041 --> 43:55.500
Then let me help you.

43:56.083 --> 43:58.791
You can get out for good. Be done with it.

44:01.666 --> 44:02.791
It's not so easy.

44:02.875 --> 44:05.791
Yes, it is.
I'm working with the Americans now.

44:06.500 --> 44:10.583
I can get you money, documents.
Everything you need to disappear.

44:12.833 --> 44:14.000
Just like I did.

44:15.208 --> 44:18.958
Let us say,
when I deliver what they want from me,

44:20.250 --> 44:22.541
I could demand this Gideon is there too.

44:27.208 --> 44:32.416
Then, uh, afterwards you can just
reach me on this number.

44:36.750 --> 44:38.833
Are you still staying at the same flat?

44:39.416 --> 44:40.333
Just dirtier.

44:43.958 --> 44:45.458
Then that's where we'll meet.

44:47.625 --> 44:50.041
I trust you. Only you.

44:52.625 --> 44:54.625
I would never
betray you, Dima.

44:59.958 --> 45:03.625
Tomás… Shit.
You've been followed.

46:02.458 --> 46:04.000
You really wanna fight, bitch?

46:07.916 --> 46:09.000
Okay.

46:59.666 --> 47:00.958
When I tell Felipe…

47:03.583 --> 47:05.833
he's gonna cut you up into little pieces.

47:12.041 --> 47:12.916
Hey, hey, hey!

47:17.125 --> 47:19.708
Bitch! Nasty bitch!

47:19.791 --> 47:20.833
Vagina!

47:24.916 --> 47:25.750
Look out!

47:50.416 --> 47:52.000
Don't do anything foolish.

47:52.083 --> 47:54.208
Or your brain will add
to this revolting filth.

47:54.291 --> 47:57.833
I don't know who the hell you are,
but I work for some powerful people.

47:58.333 --> 48:00.458
So tread carefully.

48:11.416 --> 48:12.541
Damían…

48:13.583 --> 48:16.458
I believe the person for whom you work…

48:19.875 --> 48:20.750
is me.

48:24.166 --> 48:25.208
Svetlana?

48:26.666 --> 48:29.791
Of course. You are Gideon.

48:30.500 --> 48:33.583
You know, all those many years ago,

48:34.125 --> 48:36.333
Anya told me about your romance.

48:37.083 --> 48:40.833
How you had wanted to marry her.
Have a family.

48:40.916 --> 48:42.708
It was very touching.

48:43.291 --> 48:44.750
Keep Anya out of this.

48:45.500 --> 48:48.458
But the trouble was she never loved you.

48:49.708 --> 48:52.000
She thought you were weak.

48:52.583 --> 48:56.875
Destined to bend spinelessly
to the wills of much stronger men.

48:56.958 --> 48:58.458
What the fuck do you want?

48:59.666 --> 49:03.625
I have grown so very tired
of asking for what I want.

49:04.875 --> 49:08.458
Only to have those whom I asked
disobey me.

49:12.500 --> 49:16.458
So now, I do not have to ask.
