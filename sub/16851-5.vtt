00:03.871 --> 00:05.339
Your son
has brain stem syndrome.

00:05.373 --> 00:07.441
No, don't worry.
The name can be misleading.

00:07.475 --> 00:09.543
It's more of a disease,
than a syndrome.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.545
Man, this locker room
isn't haunted.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.481
"Brazil's most haunted
locker rooms."

00:13.514 --> 00:16.550
The prettiest chicks
in all of Brazil.

00:16.584 --> 00:18.519
Best administrator
in all of Brazil.

00:18.552 --> 00:19.820
Come on.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.356
Which by the way
is where we are, now.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.459
This hospital is in Brazil
as we all know, fully staffed by

00:25.493 --> 00:27.761
and in service
of expatriate Americans.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.663
[theme music]

00:32.633 --> 00:35.136
[thinking]
 Vanity. When you
 don't see beyond yourself

00:35.169 --> 00:37.138
you fail to see others.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.773
And when you fail to see
 others, you become the opposite

00:39.807 --> 00:41.775
of Bruce Willis
 in Sixth Sense.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.777
You don't see alive people.

00:43.811 --> 00:48.449
My point is...you are so much
 hotter than Bruce Willis.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.819
Sweet surgery, yo. We removed
that boy's tumor just in time.

00:51.852 --> 00:55.689
Really? I was so in the zone,
I ripped whatever looked weird.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.391
Oh, my God.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.393
'Is that Sarah Hyland
from Modern Family?'

00:59.427 --> 01:02.363
No, it's not.
That's the work of Tug Spano.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.764
The new pediatric
plastic surgeon.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.199
Who's Tug Spano?

01:05.233 --> 01:07.335
The new pediatric
plastic surgeon.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.337
- What's his name?
- Tug Spano.

01:09.370 --> 01:12.806
Check this out. He can make
a kid look like a teen pop idol.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.210
Their favorite politician,
anything they want.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.678
Before, after.

01:17.711 --> 01:20.114
And this kid's career
is blowing up, right now.

01:20.148 --> 01:22.616
- He is good.
- No, he's gooder.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.553
And he is even better than
gooder with the ladies. Check.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.791
He's teaching her yoga.
How pretentious.

01:30.824 --> 01:33.561
And that...is how
I would have sex with you.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.263
[laughing]

01:35.296 --> 01:37.498
Uh-oh. Looks like the natives
getting jealous.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.769
Namaste, doc docs.
Tug Spano, M.D.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.405
Look. I know, that
each of you has a history

01:44.438 --> 01:46.440
with some of the
femalic doctors around here.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.342
I'll be upfront
about this.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.778
The Tug man'll be putting
the moves on these ladies.

01:50.811 --> 01:54.548
By that, I mean, I'll be putting
my fantastic penis in them.

01:59.487 --> 02:03.591
- Wow, cigarillos cool again?
- God, I hope so.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.626
I'm telling you.
This is not our baby.

02:05.659 --> 02:09.197
Alright, I'm gonna chalk this up
to first time parent jitters.

02:09.229 --> 02:12.233
- This baby is Chinese.
- Your wife blasted a Chinaman?

02:12.266 --> 02:14.435
Not my problem.
Thank you.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.172
'Number 19.'

02:18.872 --> 02:20.808
Okay, here we..

02:23.677 --> 02:26.514
(all)
R. A. P. E.

02:26.547 --> 02:29.317
Resist all possible encounters.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.918
In this class

02:30.951 --> 02:34.188
you will learn how to beat
the rapist...at his own game.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.290
Or her own game.

02:36.324 --> 02:38.492
Beat the rapist
at her own game.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.294
Oh, Blakey.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.330
(laughing)
Her. That's impossible.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.731
[dramatic music]

02:50.871 --> 02:55.343
Somebody, help me!
I was just date raped!

02:55.376 --> 02:57.711
Alright. Everybody,
got their rape whistles?

02:57.745 --> 02:59.713
'Always keep 'em with you.'

02:59.747 --> 03:01.649
Especially, at discount
movie theaters.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.552
I'll be damned, if I'm gonna
let some skin slinger like..

03:04.585 --> 03:05.786
- What's his name?
- Tug Spano.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.521
...move in on our turf.

03:07.555 --> 03:10.591
Yeah. If we back down now,
we'll never get back on top.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.626
- Come on, let's get a churro.
 - Oh, churros.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.428
Think about it.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.464
If our patients know,
we're not getting laid

03:16.497 --> 03:18.566
right and left,
they're not gonna respect.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.669
Next, they're taking away
our hospital issued Escalades.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.705
- 'I practically live in that.'
- 'I literally live in mine.'

03:24.738 --> 03:26.840
(male #1)
'God, tough times
all around.'

03:26.874 --> 03:29.277
(male #2)
'Next, they're taking away
our record contracts.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.978
What? But my album
just dropped.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.980
Cocaina fresquinha.
 Cocaina fresquinha.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.815
- You want some cocaine?
- Nah.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.417
- Cocaina fresquinha.
 - Si.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.019
- Dos churritos.
- Hey, I got it!

03:39.052 --> 03:41.389
You know how Cat
has venereal warts, right?

03:41.422 --> 03:42.523
- Of course.
- Okay.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.358
We trick Cat
into sleeping with Tug.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.794
Then, he gets warts,
no one's gonna wanna touch him.

03:46.827 --> 03:49.630
We'll be back on top,
which is my favorite position.

03:49.663 --> 03:52.266
'Let's get back to the hospital
which is in Brazil.'

03:52.300 --> 03:54.302
It's kind of a grey area,
but yes.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.604
Generally speaking,
if it happens on spring break

03:56.637 --> 03:58.706
then, it's not considered rape.

03:58.739 --> 04:03.344
Alright. Today we'll go over
a great self defense strategy.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.012
- Pooping yourself.
- I'll volunteer.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.047
Why, Blake, I didn't
ask for a volunt--

04:07.080 --> 04:08.582
But...first..

04:12.653 --> 04:14.722
...I'd like
to make a testimonial.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.891
There she is. I'll set her up,
you knock her down.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.728
And hopefully, she'll take
the bait and sleep with Tug.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.730
Hey, girlfriend.
Guess who has--

04:22.763 --> 04:26.400
Not now, guys. I'm late to go
have sex with Tug.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.635
We did it!

04:27.668 --> 04:29.069
Doctor, this is not our child.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.705
We got the wrong child, too.
We had a girl.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.675
I ordered a meatball sub,
you gave me an Eskimo kid.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.877
People, people. Please.
Shut up.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.747
You have got to trust
the system that is in place.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.916
Now, the babies that you have
are...probably yours.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.085
Please, take them,
and-and raise them.

04:45.118 --> 04:50.891
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a meatball sub to eat.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.527
Need some chips, need some
chips, some chips. Excuse me.

04:53.561 --> 04:56.630
And I see her here,
every day.

04:56.664 --> 04:59.667
And I have to pretend
like everything's cool.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.470
You know,
but...it's not.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.806
- 'And it never will be.'
- Blake.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.809
Your courage to share
such an emasculating

05:08.842 --> 05:12.546
and ridiculous trauma...
has opened up the door

05:12.580 --> 05:16.316
for other male rape victims
to share their stories. Anyone?

05:18.586 --> 05:20.988
I'm proud o' you, Blake.
Let's have a group hug.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.424
(female #1)
'You did it,
how do you feel?'

05:23.457 --> 05:24.492
(Blake)
Good.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.897
[whistle blowing]

05:29.930 --> 05:32.533
(Tug)
'We had to change him,
primarily, for legal reasons.'

05:32.566 --> 05:36.103
But I think, Barney purple
was an awesome call, man. Kudos.

05:36.136 --> 05:38.539
- So, it's that easy.
- Oh, I wish.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.375
First, we put this knucklehead
to sleep so he's not asking

05:41.409 --> 05:43.577
to play his iPhone games
every five minutes.

05:43.611 --> 05:47.415
Then, once he is out, these
practiced hands will slowly

05:47.448 --> 05:49.450
gently remove
the epidermal layer

05:49.483 --> 05:53.521
leaving him completely...exposed
and vulnerable.

05:53.554 --> 05:56.624
Oh. Then what?

05:56.657 --> 05:59.827
Yeah. Then what, doctor?

05:59.860 --> 06:03.030
Then, I'll manipulate the
myofascial layer with my finger.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.699
Maybe, two fingers.
If you know what I mean.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.469
- I don't know what you mean.
- Here, take that.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.938
Then, when the muscles
are responding to my touch

06:10.971 --> 06:12.940
just the right way

06:12.973 --> 06:16.644
I'll know, that you're ready for
insertion...of an epidermal tap.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.660
Valerie, I need
to speak with you, right now.

06:32.693 --> 06:35.095
What you did to me
in that closet last year

06:35.128 --> 06:36.597
was an act of power..

06:36.630 --> 06:39.433
and aggression,
and it was wrong.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.536
But you know what?

06:42.570 --> 06:45.138
I am strong and I am
taking back the night.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.044
You are worth nothing.
You're ugly.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.147
Everything that has ever gone
wrong in your life is your fault

06:54.181 --> 06:55.716
because God hates you.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.050
[gasps]

06:57.084 --> 07:00.153
But I don't hate you.
I'm the only one.

07:00.187 --> 07:04.091
I'm...in...your...head.

07:06.794 --> 07:07.895
Boo.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.199
- Scram.
- Thank you.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.202
Oh, my God.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.203
[whistle blowing]

07:18.271 --> 07:21.475
- Oh, hey, Tug. Guess what?
- Hey, bro-bros.

07:21.509 --> 07:24.578
The Tug thug is making this kid
look like a purple cucumber.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.580
So, you two need
to shove off.

07:26.614 --> 07:29.016
Oh, yeah? Well, I think,
you're gonna wanna hear this.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.852
Yeah, involves a certain someone
you did a certain something with

07:31.885 --> 07:33.887
who then transmitted
a certain sexually transmitted

07:33.921 --> 07:36.156
something to a certain
penis on your groin.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.992
Normally, I'd love to talk
about all the punani I get

07:39.026 --> 07:41.895
but right now, as always,
business comes before pleasure.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.631
Hot glue gun.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.967
He chooses doctoring over sex.
Impressive.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.002
Hey, I got an idea.

07:49.036 --> 07:52.172
You guys, want to take
a hit off this surgery?

07:52.205 --> 07:55.042
- Hell, yeah.
- Yeah.

07:55.075 --> 07:58.278
Tug, you were incredible.
I mean, just so relaxed.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.213
Hey man,
it's called "flow."

08:00.247 --> 08:02.916
Just doing what I love,
and loving what I do.

08:04.652 --> 08:05.653
Whoa.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.556
Max, are you okay?

08:08.589 --> 08:11.625
The whole maternity ward
is a mess and it's all my fault.

08:11.659 --> 08:14.194
I gave everybody the wrong baby.
I'm gonna get fired.

08:14.227 --> 08:18.265
And my...meatball sub
tasted a little off today.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.167
Hey, doc.
Maybe, I can help out.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.836
I can perform plastic surgery
on the mismatched infants

08:22.870 --> 08:25.272
so, they'll look like the
parents they're to be with.

08:25.305 --> 08:28.241
- Yeah, let's do that, now.
- Hold on. This seems extreme.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.510
What do you say?
Bros helping bros?

08:32.212 --> 08:34.181
This seems
wildly irresponsible.

08:34.214 --> 08:37.017
Yeah, but if there's one thing
I've learned from all this

08:37.049 --> 08:39.052
it's that doing unnecessary
plastic surgery on kids

08:39.086 --> 08:40.888
gets you crazy laid.

08:42.655 --> 08:46.159
- We're in.
- Let's didgeridoo this, guys.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.262
Remind us to tell you about
this goof we pulled on you

08:49.296 --> 08:51.264
when we hated
your chiseled guts.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.634
Can't wait, man.
I love a good goof.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.203
You, Max.
What are you thinking?

08:56.236 --> 08:58.238
What's happening up there
on the maternity ward?

08:58.271 --> 09:00.608
Not to worry, Sy.
I got a solid plan.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.676
- Too late. You're fired.
- Whoa, easy, Sy.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.311
You got the wrong guy.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.547
- I'm the one that mixed 'em up.
- Okay, you're fired.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.218
Tug.

09:11.251 --> 09:14.221
I'm stirred up this hive,
let me take the sting.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.890
I realize now, the old
Tugboat pulled into this harbor

09:16.924 --> 09:18.892
a little too quick
for most folks

09:18.926 --> 09:21.194
but that's just how
the Tugger pulls.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.597
Unless, the sign reads,
this property is condemned..

09:23.631 --> 09:24.898
...I move right in.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.134
Sometimes, I squat,
if you know what I mean.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.603
We gotta let Tug make things
right at Childrens.

09:29.637 --> 09:32.105
And that, my friends,
is the dug-dug on smug Tug.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.341
Tug, you can't go.
You're one of us now.

09:34.374 --> 09:37.177
Time for the Tug slug
to slither on down the road.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.980
Tug rug needs
to lay in other rooms.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.115
Plus, I don't have
a medical degree. Tug.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.984
[The Wealthy West
 singing "Home"]

09:44.017 --> 09:48.021
* You took some chances
leaving the way that you did *

09:48.055 --> 09:49.923
(Max)
'We'll miss you, Tug Spano.'

09:49.957 --> 09:51.959
* But you can't
know things that.. *

09:51.992 --> 09:54.027
And you have warts.

09:54.061 --> 09:57.164
Come on.
Let's get outta here.

09:57.197 --> 10:01.168
[thinking]
 When you look beyond yourself,
 you open your heart to others..

10:01.201 --> 10:03.236
...which can sometimes
 lead to rape

10:03.270 --> 10:05.105
but most times..

10:05.138 --> 10:07.975
...it teaches you to be
 the best person you can be.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.777
And hopefully..

10:09.810 --> 10:12.179
...that's the person
 you were meant to be all along.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.619
Oh, I'm totally gonna
 make cigarillos cool again.
