- And weren't a bunch of them
stolen this morning?

09:52.224 --> 09:54.927

about no stolen hams.

09:54.994 --> 09:57.430
- Okay, then how did
you pay for this one?

it was Jeff?

my house right now

an expensive Venetian ham.

is Sherlock Holmes!"

- Jeff, that did not happen.

- Prove it.

- Sherlock Holmes isn't real.

Jeff doesn't grab that stolen

But not today!
- What are you saying?

18:01.079 --> 18:03.482
- We're gonna
eat the evidence.

18:03.549 --> 18:05.117
- [ gasps ]

18:05.184 --> 18:07.486
- You're right.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.388
They can't arrest your brother
if there's no evidence.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.824
- But, that's ten pounds
of cured ham!

18:11.890 --> 18:12.958
- We can't eat all that!

18:13.025 --> 18:14.693
- We've got to try.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.094
- Ahhh!
- Ow, ow!

18:16.161 --> 18:17.396
- Billy's right,

18:17.463 --> 18:19.498
everyone start stuffing
ham in your mouth!

18:19.565 --> 18:20.699
- Yes!

19:08.080 --> 19:09.915
- TIME'S UP!
WE'RE COMING IN!

19:09.982 --> 19:11.750
Go ahead.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.151
- Hello officer--

19:16.922 --> 19:18.657
[ all groaning ]

19:18.724 --> 19:21.193
- Hey officers.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.928
No stolen ham here.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.696
- We don't care
nothin' 'bout that.

19:24.763 --> 19:26.465
- You don't?

19:26.532 --> 19:27.900
- We wouldn't waste
our precious time

19:27.966 --> 19:29.668
looking for stolen ham.

19:29.735 --> 19:30.936
[ all groan ]

19:31.003 --> 19:33.505
We're looking
for illegal dolls.

19:33.572 --> 19:34.973
- Ah, geez...

19:35.040 --> 19:37.943
- [ sniffs ]
Follow me.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.746
- What is going on?

19:40.812 --> 19:43.148
- We got a tip that
someone's been selling

19:43.215 --> 19:45.784
stolen Fresno Girl dolls
on the internets.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.453
See that ain't legal.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.788
- Listen Billy,

19:49.855 --> 19:51.690
I might be going away
for a little while...

19:51.757 --> 19:52.958
- Seriously?

19:53.025 --> 19:54.626
- Well I don't want
to say anything

19:54.693 --> 19:56.328
without a lawyer present,
but...

19:56.395 --> 19:58.063
- Oh I got a good lawyer.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.866
He also works
down at Nacho Ball.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.135
- We got 'em.

20:03.201 --> 20:04.803
They were in
the girl's room.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.139
And get this,

20:07.205 --> 20:11.777
some of the heads
were filled with bread.

20:11.843 --> 20:12.978
- What?!

20:13.045 --> 20:15.647
- You sick freak.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.749
Let's go.

20:17.816 --> 20:18.984
- Wait for me, Billy!

20:19.051 --> 20:21.820
Wait for me on the other
siiiiiiiide...!

20:25.824 --> 20:27.693
- Hey, I'm sorry they
arrested your girlfriend, Billy.

20:27.759 --> 20:30.128
- Yeah, whatever.
- She's got potential.

20:30.195 --> 20:32.164
- I'm sorry I doubted you.

20:32.230 --> 20:33.966
You know, I never
should have accused you

20:34.032 --> 20:35.334
of stealing that ham.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.002
- It's all good, bro.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.237
I even got one bite
a ham left.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.306
Stuck it in my pants
when the cops showed up.

20:41.373 --> 20:44.843
Who wants some pants-ham?

20:44.910 --> 20:46.812
Fine, suit yourself.

20:58.857 --> 21:02.961
Okay, I stole it.

21:03.028 --> 21:06.531
- I KNEW IT!
- That's my boy.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.601
- But you gave us
that speech!

21:09.668 --> 21:12.971
- I cried!

21:13.038 --> 21:14.873
- I'm a Bilsky.
We lie.

21:14.940 --> 21:15.974
- Up top, bro...

21:16.041 --> 21:17.542
- Bilskys!
- Bilskys!

21:19.177 --> 21:21.380
- Jeff!
- What?

21:21.446 --> 21:22.914
- Good luck catchin' me!

21:22.981 --> 21:25.450
Ahhh! I should have
never wished you luck...

21:30.355 --> 21:32.491
- Oh man, I am never
eating ham again...

21:32.557 --> 21:34.426
- Me, neither, man.
- Actually ham sounds good.

21:34.493 --> 21:39.431
- I'm glad you said that--
- Ahhhhh!

21:39.498 --> 21:40.966
- Hey, why are
the lights off?!

21:41.033 --> 21:44.202
- Because we don't
need them.

21:44.269 --> 21:46.004
- We have
night vision now!

21:46.071 --> 21:47.572
- The liquid cleanse worked!

21:47.639 --> 21:49.675
- Well turn them back on!

21:49.741 --> 21:54.212
Gahhh!

21:54.279 --> 21:55.614
I'm okay!

21:57.149 --> 21:59.418
- I'm going home.
