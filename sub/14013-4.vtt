00:23.923 --> 00:25.823
<i>In the criminal
justice system,</i>

00:25.892 --> 00:29.658
<i>the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups:</i>

00:29.729 --> 00:31.560
<i>The police
who investigate crime,</i>

00:31.664 --> 00:34.394
<i>and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:34.501 --> 00:35.763
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:51.451 --> 00:53.885
Mrs. Feffer says
my hands are too small.

00:53.953 --> 00:55.750
I say your mouth's too big.

00:55.855 --> 00:58.221
She says maybe I should
switch to the clarinet.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.020
Proves my point.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.456
Next year I get
to be in the band.

01:22.615 --> 01:24.583
Should put you in
the corner at Shea, huh?

01:24.651 --> 01:27.017
I'd go for a hell of a lot
less than $29 million.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.248
Guy's a bum.
What's he at, 2.20?

01:29.322 --> 01:31.381
Hey, he's better than the
last guy they had, huh?

01:31.458 --> 01:33.255
Least he could do
is break a leg.

01:33.326 --> 01:35.260
He can't hurt
the team from the DL.

01:36.229 --> 01:38.493
Cindy Jo started
the flute last year.

01:38.631 --> 01:40.929
Mrs. Gelfand says
she can be in the band.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.228
They get uniforms.

01:42.302 --> 01:45.396
Learn to sing
and we can all retire.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.440
No! My music.

01:50.009 --> 01:51.033
We gotta go back.

01:52.245 --> 01:53.234
Roberto?

02:04.924 --> 02:07.484
Somebody call an ambulance.
911.

02:07.594 --> 02:09.925
You all right?
Sit down, okay.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.327
You okay?
You in any pain?

02:11.431 --> 02:13.126
Check the driver.

02:18.771 --> 02:19.829
Did you see it?

02:19.906 --> 02:20.930
Must have been going 40.

02:21.007 --> 02:22.838
Kid's name is Roberto Martinez.

02:22.909 --> 02:24.740
Guys from Al are
down at the scene.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.472
His kid sister said
he passed out.

02:26.546 --> 02:28.707
My guess, drunk out of
his mind or drugged out.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.476
Call the family.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.078
Did you do the accident?

02:32.152 --> 02:34.143
Bystanders, bumps and bruises.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.983
What about the Martinez kid?

02:36.055 --> 02:38.114
Not his lucky day.
DOA.

02:38.958 --> 02:40.050
You do his blood?

02:40.126 --> 02:41.684
No alcohol, no drugs.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.826
His sister said he passed out.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.387
That's consistent.

02:45.532 --> 02:47.022
The kid had a heart attack.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.694
Hello?

04:15.488 --> 04:17.353
Roberto is dead,

04:17.423 --> 04:19.447
and there's nothing you can do?

04:19.524 --> 04:22.358
Mrs. Martinez,
it's most unfortunate.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.417
The hospital said

04:23.496 --> 04:24.793
your son died of
a heart attack.

04:24.864 --> 04:26.559
Of course he had
a heart attack.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.658
He had a pacemaker
that wasrt won'th the plastic

04:28.735 --> 04:29.793
it was wrapped in.

04:29.869 --> 04:31.700
Pacemaker?

04:32.438 --> 04:33.905
The kid was, what, 16?

04:34.040 --> 04:35.667
18.

04:35.842 --> 04:38.606
What, it's only illegal
to kill minors these days?

04:38.678 --> 04:40.543
Roberto had a heart condition.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.911
Some quack sticks
a do-da in his chest,

04:42.982 --> 04:44.415
the thing misfires,
and he's dead.

04:44.484 --> 04:45.712
I'm really very sorry,

04:45.818 --> 04:47.718
but if there was
a crime here, Mr. Fischel,

04:47.787 --> 04:49.118
then I don't see it.

04:49.188 --> 04:50.621
Now if what
you're saying is true,

04:50.690 --> 04:53.090
then your client can sue the
company that made the pacemaker.

04:53.159 --> 04:54.683
Excuse me, but, uh,

04:54.761 --> 04:56.752
what law school did you go to?

04:56.863 --> 04:58.956
We're suing
the company for millions.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.466
We're suing
the doctor for millions.

05:01.534 --> 05:04.901
Mrs. Martinez here
wants a little justice.

05:05.505 --> 05:07.735
You mean revenge, don't you?

05:09.142 --> 05:11.406
Why don't you just
work with us, okay, Counselor?

05:12.612 --> 05:14.580
Roberto didn't need
a pacemaker.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.706
In my book,
that's unnecessary surgery.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.478
The thing craps out,
and he's dead.

05:18.551 --> 05:20.314
That's assault
and felony murder.

05:20.386 --> 05:21.819
I thought he had
a heart condition.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.685
Oh, it could have been
treated with drugs,

05:23.756 --> 05:24.916
but then the good doctor's fee

05:24.991 --> 05:26.458
would have been cut in half.

05:26.526 --> 05:28.118
What is this doctor's name?

05:28.261 --> 05:29.888
Dr. Trevor Hellems.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.293
He's on 87th.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.125
Okay.

05:33.199 --> 05:34.427
We'll check it out.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.489
Thank you.

05:35.735 --> 05:37.259
Mrs. Martinez.

05:40.606 --> 05:42.198
Hey, Fischel,

05:44.577 --> 05:47.341
what makes you such
a freaking humanitarian?

05:47.447 --> 05:49.506
I get this dirtbag indicted,

05:49.582 --> 05:52.642
and the insurance company
settles on day one.

05:52.952 --> 05:55.045
And this dirtbag is guilty.

05:59.625 --> 06:01.183
No, I didn't expect you,

06:01.260 --> 06:03.057
but I certainly know
why you're here.

06:03.129 --> 06:05.563
Peter Fischel.
Talk about sharks.

06:06.232 --> 06:07.824
He's already
served you with papers?

06:07.900 --> 06:08.958
Yeah.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.730
The mars the reason
a lot of doctors

06:10.803 --> 06:13.271
I graduated with
are now driving cabs.

06:13.473 --> 06:14.940
He's topped himself this time,

06:15.007 --> 06:16.338
calling in the infantry.

06:16.409 --> 06:18.604
Well, he claims the surgery
on Roberto Martinez

06:18.678 --> 06:20.145
was unnecessary.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.339
I didn't know they taught

06:21.414 --> 06:23.882
supraventricular
tachycardia in law school.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.780
That, uh, was
Roberto's problem.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.449
An irregular heartbeat
that speeds up

06:29.522 --> 06:31.217
now and again from a normal 70

06:31.290 --> 06:33.451
to as high as 200 beats
per minute.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.254
And the pacemaker
controls that?

06:35.328 --> 06:36.556
It's supposed to.

06:36.629 --> 06:38.620
Is it possible
Roberto could have lived

06:38.698 --> 06:39.995
without the pacemaker?

06:40.066 --> 06:42.000
You saw what happened
when it didn't work.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.161
Mr. Fischel contends
he could have been treated

06:44.237 --> 06:45.602
just as effectively with drugs.

06:45.671 --> 06:48.003
Hmm. Some doctors
might agree,

06:48.141 --> 06:49.733
but I'm of the school
that believes

06:49.809 --> 06:51.834
you don't needlessly
subject young patients

06:51.911 --> 06:53.902
to a lifetime of toxic drugs.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.107
Yeah, but the drugs
don't usually break.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.376
Neither do BioNorm pacemakers.

06:58.785 --> 07:02.516
Pacemaker technology has been
well-established for decades.

07:03.289 --> 07:06.190
BioNorm Industries
is at the forefront.

07:07.193 --> 07:09.161
My decision to
implant the device

07:09.228 --> 07:11.162
was a sound medical decision,

07:11.230 --> 07:13.664
no matter what
Mr. Fischel says.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.994
And I guess I'll spend
the next six years

07:17.069 --> 07:18.696
in court proving it.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.333
Mrs. Martinez,

07:23.443 --> 07:25.468
we spoke with
several specialists

07:25.545 --> 07:26.739
and they have told us

07:26.813 --> 07:28.303
that Dr. Hellems
did nothing illegal

07:28.381 --> 07:30.042
when he operated on Roberto.

07:30.149 --> 07:32.208
If nobody did anything wrong,

07:32.318 --> 07:35.549
then why did they offer me
$50,000 this morning?

07:36.522 --> 07:37.580
Who are "they"?

07:37.690 --> 07:40.887
BioNorm. The company
that made the pacemaker.

07:40.993 --> 07:42.654
Did you take it?

07:44.397 --> 07:45.386
Roberto said

07:45.465 --> 07:47.330
that when he was a rich doctor,

07:47.400 --> 07:50.062
he'd pay for Ana
to go to Juilliard.

07:52.738 --> 07:55.002
$50,000 pays tuition.

07:55.174 --> 07:57.699
They told me
that I had to sign a paper

07:57.777 --> 07:59.369
agreeing not to say anything.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.444
I want the world to know

08:02.515 --> 08:04.608
that these people
killed my son.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.717
Could be BioNorm has a heart.

08:08.788 --> 08:11.279
This is corporate America,
not a Cub Scout troop.

08:11.390 --> 08:13.381
You do a good deed,
your PR department

08:13.459 --> 08:15.051
splashes it
all over the front page.

08:15.127 --> 08:16.719
My old man got a new ticker.

08:16.796 --> 08:18.730
Got to listen to
my old lady screaming at him

08:18.798 --> 08:19.822
for six more years.

08:19.899 --> 08:20.888
And your point is?

08:20.967 --> 08:21.934
These companies,

08:22.001 --> 08:23.559
their job is
keeping people alive.

08:23.636 --> 08:24.762
Yeah, and if they screw up,

08:24.837 --> 08:26.361
they ought to get
handed a pink slip.

08:26.439 --> 08:29.169
Phil, one person out of 100,000
dies from taking penicillin.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.766
That means
we shouldn't take it?

08:30.843 --> 08:32.970
No, but what if there's a
chance the penicillin is bad?

08:33.044 --> 08:34.307
One kid died, Phil.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.109
One kid that we know about.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.150
And that scares
the hell out of me.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.814
Lawyers call it compensation.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.549
I call it blackmail.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.123
There's absolutely
nothing wrong

08:48.194 --> 08:49.923
with the device
in that boy's heart.

08:49.996 --> 08:51.327
So you examined it?

08:51.397 --> 08:52.728
No, I didn't have to.

08:52.798 --> 08:54.561
Look, whatever study
you want to go by,

08:54.634 --> 08:57.432
our pacemaker's one of the
top three sellers in the world.

08:57.503 --> 08:58.765
We've never had any problem.

08:58.838 --> 09:01.068
You offered
Mrs. Martinez $50,000.

09:01.140 --> 09:02.505
Some might say
that's a solution

09:02.575 --> 09:03.974
to a pretty big problem.

09:04.477 --> 09:05.774
$50,000.

09:05.845 --> 09:08.177
That would be in my lawyer's
pocket the first week.

09:08.247 --> 09:10.511
There was an itch.
I tried to scratch it.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.709
Mr. Cleary,
that's more than an itch.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.045
The boy died.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.144
Well, do you want me

09:15.221 --> 09:17.212
to hop down in the grave
beside him?

09:17.957 --> 09:19.288
Look, 35 years ago,

09:19.358 --> 09:22.191
my old man owned
a greasy spoon in Corona.

09:22.428 --> 09:25.090
An old lady slipped.
She broke her hip.

09:25.164 --> 09:27.598
By the time her gaggle of
shysters got through with him,

09:27.667 --> 09:29.532
he didn't have
a proverbial pot.

09:29.635 --> 09:30.727
Now, there's no way

09:30.803 --> 09:32.794
lightning strikes
my family twice.

09:32.872 --> 09:34.703
If Roberto's pacemaker
didn't function,

09:34.774 --> 09:35.798
he is entitled to...

09:35.875 --> 09:37.638
Check your source, Detective.

09:37.777 --> 09:39.745
Peter Fischel said
it was a malfunction.

09:39.812 --> 09:42.212
That's the first thing
those people always say.

09:42.281 --> 09:44.215
What about the gag order?

09:44.317 --> 09:46.342
I've got nothing against
Mrs. Martinez.

09:46.485 --> 09:48.544
She seems like
a very nice person.

09:48.654 --> 09:50.144
<i>But if she goes on
Geraldo</i>

09:50.222 --> 09:52.247
and starts talking about
how her boy died

09:52.325 --> 09:54.520
with one of my pacemakers
in his chest,

09:54.627 --> 09:57.687
well, my whole company
goes down the crapper.

10:00.199 --> 10:01.598
So, you tell me, who's worse,

10:01.667 --> 10:03.601
the lawyers or their clients?

10:03.669 --> 10:05.603
Scrape the bottom
of any cesspool,

10:05.671 --> 10:07.696
you'll find it lined with JDs.

10:07.907 --> 10:10.375
Everything works until
some lawyer says it doesn't.

10:10.476 --> 10:12.740
And as Mr. Cleary
so elegantly opined:

10:12.845 --> 10:15.313
"That's the first thing
those people always say."

10:15.381 --> 10:17.611
That's seems a pretty astute
observation for somebody

10:17.683 --> 10:19.480
who's never had
a legal problem.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.383
Cleary said he never had
any problems

10:21.454 --> 10:22.478
with his pacemakers,

10:22.555 --> 10:24.750
not that he never got sued.

10:25.124 --> 10:28.423
Maybe we should get
the other side of the story.

10:32.198 --> 10:34.166
Sorry. As far as I can tell,
there's nothing

10:34.233 --> 10:35.996
currently pending against them.

10:36.068 --> 10:38.093
A corporation
that's not getting sued?

10:38.170 --> 10:39.899
There goes my faith in America.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.372
Well, they could still be
knee-deep in litigation.

10:42.441 --> 10:43.874
You can sue
without going to court?

10:43.943 --> 10:45.968
In civil cases,
the courts don't get involved

10:46.045 --> 10:48.445
until one of the parties needs
a judicial determination.

10:48.514 --> 10:50.379
So until then,
the court has no record.

10:50.449 --> 10:52.747
If the case is settled,
the court may never know.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.080
We have no way of knowing

10:54.153 --> 10:55.643
if BioNorm has ever been sued.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.655
You could check with FDA.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.985
They'll at least have
a record of complaints.

11:00.126 --> 11:01.388
Sure, I've heard of them.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.325
They make pacemakers,
insulin regulators.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.023
Expanding daily.

11:05.097 --> 11:07.588
Inside info,
they're goir public any day.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.430
Any problems with
those pacemakers?

11:09.502 --> 11:10.935
Nothing dramatic.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.267
Half a dozen preliminary
reports from doctors.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.273
How about
malfunctioning pacemakers?

11:15.341 --> 11:17.104
I don't have any specifics.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.041
They've never got
past the complaint stage.

11:19.111 --> 11:21.545
Six pacemakers failed,
and you never followed up?

11:21.614 --> 11:23.206
Excuse me,
but it was the doctors

11:23.282 --> 11:25.216
who never followed up.

11:26.318 --> 11:29.151
They file a complaint,
we send them the forms.

11:29.255 --> 11:32.986
If the doctors don't respond,
we don't pursue the matter.

11:33.459 --> 11:35.427
It's an election year,
gentlemen.

11:35.494 --> 11:37.860
Everybody wants
to cut government spending.

11:37.930 --> 11:40.023
Guess whose pocket is
the first to get picked?

11:40.099 --> 11:42.124
Let me guess.
You, me, and everybody else.

11:42.268 --> 11:44.634
We are understaffed, underpaid.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.399
The whole country's
screaming about

11:46.472 --> 11:47.734
silicone breast implants,

11:47.807 --> 11:50.298
Halcion, irradiated food.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.870
Six pacemakers
that may have malfunctioned,

11:54.213 --> 11:56.374
that's not a high priority.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.241
So you just let it go.

11:58.317 --> 12:00.376
Cross your fingers,
hope no one else dies.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.045
We are not a policing agency.

12:02.121 --> 12:03.418
We are.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.251
Suppose you
just give us the numbers

12:05.324 --> 12:07.258
of those doctors
who filed the complaints?

12:07.827 --> 12:09.658
I hate to be an iconoclast.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.492
I thought you
were a cardiologist.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.828
Some doctors actually care
about their patients.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.992
Doctor, the FDA
says you filed a report

12:16.068 --> 12:18.434
but never followed up
with the questionnaire.

12:20.873 --> 12:22.306
Alan Stein.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.173
At 35, he finished
his fourth marathon.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.303
The only trouble was
he smoked two packs a day

12:27.379 --> 12:30.439
and drank six cups of
black coffee before breakfast.

12:30.516 --> 12:33.246
At 40, he developed
a heart flutter.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.344
Irregular beating.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.979
And at 45?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.088
We'll never know.

12:39.158 --> 12:41.592
I convinced him of the
benefits of clean living,

12:41.694 --> 12:43.559
implanted a pacemaker.

12:43.662 --> 12:44.959
He should have lived to 80.

12:45.030 --> 12:47.430
But his BioNorm
pacemaker misfired.

12:49.401 --> 12:51.665
BioNorm bought your silence?

12:53.072 --> 12:57.372
Tracy, Alars wife,
and his 4-year-old, Ben,

12:57.943 --> 12:59.171
they needed the money.

12:59.245 --> 13:01.008
How much money did Tracy need?

13:02.348 --> 13:05.078
$250,000.
With a caveat.

13:06.385 --> 13:08.376
<i>I play Ralph Nader,
she gets nada.</i>

13:08.454 --> 13:09.682
But maybe a few other people

13:09.755 --> 13:11.620
would have been alive,
right, Doctor?

13:17.797 --> 13:20.630
All six doctors had filed
complaints with the FDA.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.325
All of their patients died

13:22.401 --> 13:24.096
with BioNorm pacemakers
in their chests.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.229
All the survivors
signed settlement agreements.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.830
Which conveniently contain
non-disclosure statements.

13:28.908 --> 13:31.342
Willie Sutton wasrt so good
at covering his tracks.

13:31.410 --> 13:32.342
Seven dead.

13:32.411 --> 13:34.276
We could be talking
about mass murder here.

13:34.346 --> 13:37.008
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
They got sued, they settled.

13:37.082 --> 13:38.811
Doesrt mean
they're out killing people.

13:38.884 --> 13:41.182
Yeah, well, that's how
I felt till Cleary lied to us.

13:41.253 --> 13:42.811
He said he'd never had
any trouble.

13:42.888 --> 13:44.753
Tell a little lie,
tell a big one.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.952
Take it from me,
Cleary is covering something.

13:49.461 --> 13:51.986
You got 24
to find out what it is.

13:52.865 --> 13:55.163
I wanted to leave a company
won'th something to my son.

13:55.234 --> 13:56.292
Sue me.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.302
No, we have
something else in mind.

13:58.370 --> 13:59.701
I already told you,
I didn't want

13:59.772 --> 14:01.740
the bad press.
$50,000 was well won'th it.

14:01.807 --> 14:03.172
Cut the crap,
Mr. Cleary.

14:03.242 --> 14:04.539
We know about the other cases.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.508
This one's different.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.777
All right, all right,

14:09.849 --> 14:12.477
we tried to take care of it
ourselves.

14:13.385 --> 14:16.513
We never sold a pacemaker
to the Martinez boy.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.491
It sure as hell
said "BioNorm."

14:19.558 --> 14:21.185
No, Dad said we didn't sell it,

14:21.260 --> 14:22.454
not that we didn't make it.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.189
When Fischel served the papers,

14:24.263 --> 14:26.925
I compared the serial numbers
to the one in the complaint.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.126
We keep records,
in case there's a recall.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.532
We sold that particular device

14:30.603 --> 14:31.831
to a Dr. Evelyn Stark

14:31.904 --> 14:34.202
for her patient Ethel Barnet.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.010
And it got into
Roberto Martinez by magic?

14:39.545 --> 14:40.944
Paper isn't the only thing

14:41.013 --> 14:43.174
being recycled
these days, Detective.

14:44.516 --> 14:46.040
Mother of God.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.249
Are you saying
the boy had a used pacemaker?

14:50.356 --> 14:52.256
Ah, the cheap bastards.

14:52.324 --> 14:54.087
They lose a big Nassau
on the golf course

14:54.159 --> 14:55.319
on Wednesday afternoon,

14:55.394 --> 14:56.827
Thursday they try to make it up

14:56.896 --> 14:58.193
selling second-hand goods.

14:58.264 --> 14:59.390
You got nothing out of it?

14:59.498 --> 15:02.433
Sure. The start of
an ulcer, a heartburn.

15:02.701 --> 15:04.862
But why the offer
to Mrs. Martinez?

15:05.704 --> 15:07.604
Well, we thought
we'd go public.

15:07.673 --> 15:08.697
We didn't want it out

15:08.774 --> 15:10.765
because people might think
we were involved.

15:10.843 --> 15:13.334
Now that wouldn't look very
good on our offering memorandum.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.006
We're doing our best to find
the guy who's doing this.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.572
I talked to
Dr. Stark personally.

15:18.884 --> 15:20.044
No comment.

15:20.119 --> 15:22.849
Let me guess.
She talked to a lawyer.

15:25.724 --> 15:27.453
That's great.
That's great.

15:33.065 --> 15:34.430
No comment.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.967
Translation:
I have nothing to say.

15:37.303 --> 15:38.861
Under advice of counsel?

15:39.505 --> 15:40.972
You blame me?

15:41.040 --> 15:42.769
Cleary calls up
ranting and raving

15:42.841 --> 15:44.809
about an 18-year-old boy
I've never heard of.

15:44.910 --> 15:46.639
Tells me if his
company goes down,

15:46.712 --> 15:48.202
I'm going down with it.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.908
You never heard of
Roberto Martinez?

15:51.283 --> 15:53.046
At the time of his death,

15:53.118 --> 15:55.052
he was found
wearing a pacemaker

15:55.120 --> 15:57.111
you had implanted
in a Mrs. Barnet.

15:57.189 --> 15:58.486
Ethel Barnet?

15:58.557 --> 15:59.751
I can't help you.

15:59.825 --> 16:01.554
Oh, what in hell is this,
Doctor?

16:01.627 --> 16:04.187
A patient kicks,
and you scavenge for parts?

16:04.263 --> 16:05.992
Now these degrees are
supposed to do more

16:06.065 --> 16:07.157
than buy you a Benz.

16:07.232 --> 16:09.757
For your information,
Detective,

16:09.969 --> 16:13.097
Mrs. Barnet is alive
and living in Short Hills.

16:13.172 --> 16:14.639
Without her pacemaker?

16:14.740 --> 16:17.766
With a new pacemaker.
It's called progress.

16:17.943 --> 16:19.934
Alden Little
Pharmaceuticals came up

16:20.012 --> 16:21.274
with a programmable device

16:21.347 --> 16:23.508
that was better suited
to Mrs. Barnet's needs.

16:23.615 --> 16:24.946
No, I'm not interested in that.

16:25.017 --> 16:26.109
What about the old one?

16:26.185 --> 16:28.745
I donated it to Manattan Med.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.550
Medical schools
are always looking

16:30.622 --> 16:32.783
for pacemakers
as teaching devices.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.753
There's a lot of new
scavengers born every year.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.764
God, I know that I'm saying
more than I should.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.356
That pacemaker
had a five-year life.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.367
Ethel used it for three years.

16:43.936 --> 16:46.268
I really thought
that I was helping.

16:46.338 --> 16:47.965
Sweeney's delight.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.975
Diseased livers,
kidneys, gall bladders,

16:51.043 --> 16:52.067
whatever you want.

16:52.144 --> 16:53.372
What about pacemakers?

16:53.512 --> 16:54.774
Right here.

16:57.616 --> 17:00.176
Go through about 25 of these
each semester.

17:00.319 --> 17:03.288
That's for a cardiology class
of maybe 12.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.652
These baby De Bakeys

17:04.723 --> 17:06.656
never seem to get it right
the first time.

17:06.724 --> 17:08.488
They all make it into class?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.960
Sure. Where else
they gonna go?

17:11.363 --> 17:14.230
Rumors. Something
about a black market.

17:17.502 --> 17:19.198
I got work to do.

17:20.005 --> 17:22.405
You may also
have time to serve.

17:26.444 --> 17:28.435
Look, six years down the road,

17:28.513 --> 17:30.277
these punks get their MD plates

17:30.349 --> 17:32.010
and they double-park
their 'vettes

17:32.084 --> 17:34.075
while they're having
their bagels and coffee.

17:34.153 --> 17:36.713
Me? My transmission
goes out,

17:36.789 --> 17:38.381
the kid needs braces.

17:39.591 --> 17:42.389
I needed a couple
of extra bucks, okay?

17:42.528 --> 17:43.722
Who's it gonna hurt?

17:43.796 --> 17:44.956
You'd be surprised.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.395
Selling school property.

17:46.465 --> 17:48.023
Minimum, that's what, larceny?

17:48.100 --> 17:50.034
Hey, we get a lot of
donations here, pal.

17:50.102 --> 17:51.535
Not all of them
are fit for use,

17:51.603 --> 17:52.968
if you know what I mean.

17:53.038 --> 17:55.632
Wait a minute.
You sell the rejects?

17:55.908 --> 17:58.399
Hey, who'd you
sell it to, Billy?

17:58.977 --> 18:00.911
Salesman.
Uh, Jeff Suiter.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.577
Uh, seemed like a nice guy.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.047
Throws me
a couple of hundred, uh,

18:04.116 --> 18:06.016
tells me we're not
breaking any laws.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.848
Where can we find
Mr. Suiter?

18:07.986 --> 18:09.783
Uh, he's a detail man.

18:09.888 --> 18:11.378
Uh, an independent.

18:11.723 --> 18:14.419
Uh, deals goods for
half a dozen companies.

18:14.960 --> 18:18.396
Look, I only did it
a couple of times.

18:18.997 --> 18:20.624
Yeah, right.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.733
Mum wanted a doctor.

18:27.339 --> 18:29.432
Only, little Jeffrey
was more interested

18:29.508 --> 18:32.033
in orgasms
than organic chemistry.

18:33.645 --> 18:36.011
But you can't escape
the wrath of motherhood

18:36.115 --> 18:38.777
so I spent four forgettable
years south of the border.

18:38.851 --> 18:39.818
You're a doctor?

18:39.885 --> 18:41.853
I graduated
from medical school, yeah.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.548
<i>El Doctoro, no way.
Never passed the Board.</i>

18:44.623 --> 18:46.352
Seems like you did all right.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.621
Well, Mum went into labor
under a lucky star.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.831
No offices, no nurses,
no malpractice premiums.

18:52.931 --> 18:55.092
Just a small warehouse
downtown.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.429
I keep six figures per,

18:56.502 --> 18:58.970
hawking medical products
for up-and-comers.

18:59.037 --> 19:01.699
I think you mean
used products, don't you?

19:01.840 --> 19:04.434
New, used.
Doesrt matter to me.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.641
Maybe it matters
to the consumer.

19:06.712 --> 19:09.044
A kid died because of
one of your retreads.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.275
I think they call that
"assumption of risk."

19:11.350 --> 19:13.614
He knew you were selling him
second-hand goods?

19:13.685 --> 19:17.018
If I didn't tell him,
I'd be breaking the law.

19:18.323 --> 19:22.384
Look, I recondition them,
I sterilize them.

19:22.694 --> 19:25.629
Mayo Clinic
couldn't tell the difference.

19:25.964 --> 19:28.228
You're telling me
this is legal?

19:28.333 --> 19:30.426
Nobody likes it,
but the legislature

19:30.502 --> 19:32.527
never got around to
making it illegal.

19:32.638 --> 19:35.038
Too busy debating
the pooper-scooper law.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.199
As long as the purchaser knew
what he was getting,

19:37.276 --> 19:38.436
it's all kosher.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.137
And if the purchaser
didn't know?

19:40.212 --> 19:41.338
It's fraud.

19:41.413 --> 19:43.643
If he didn't know,
and it killed him?

19:43.715 --> 19:45.410
Could be depraved indifference.

19:45.484 --> 19:47.418
Maybe the seller's
guilty of murder two.

19:47.819 --> 19:48.979
Unfortunately,

19:49.054 --> 19:51.318
the purchaser is unavailable
for questioning.

19:51.423 --> 19:53.323
But the mother isn't.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.794
Before Roberto was born,
we only prayed

19:56.862 --> 19:59.057
that he'd be healthy and happy.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.564
Our prayers
were half-answered.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.728
My sister's son
was two years older.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.529
Roberto wore
his shoes and his dungarees.

20:10.742 --> 20:13.404
But when it came
to my sors health,

20:13.979 --> 20:15.571
I wanted the best.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.109
So you didn't know

20:17.182 --> 20:18.706
that he was getting
a used pacemaker?

20:18.784 --> 20:21.753
We're poor.
We're not stupid and uncaring.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.012
Dr. Hellems...

20:23.088 --> 20:24.180
Killed Roberto.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.558
Mr. Fischel was right.

20:27.926 --> 20:30.053
For the wrong reason, yes.

20:32.531 --> 20:34.294
Yes. I knew.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.299
So, what is it, kickbacks?

20:36.401 --> 20:38.631
Mrs. Martinez said
you never told her.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.637
She had no medical insurance,
no money.

20:40.706 --> 20:42.367
I did what I thought was best.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.432
Well, you're just
a regular Dr. Schweitzer.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.408
I happen to be
a very good doctor.

20:46.478 --> 20:48.309
I do not appreciate...

20:50.249 --> 20:52.046
Every day you see an article

20:52.117 --> 20:54.642
about doctors inflating costs.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.319
We're crooks.
We're the enemy.

20:57.823 --> 20:59.950
I tried to save
the woman some money

21:00.025 --> 21:01.754
and keep her son alive.

21:01.827 --> 21:03.522
Well, there were
always the drugs.

21:03.662 --> 21:05.357
We've been through that.

21:05.497 --> 21:07.226
I did what was
in the best interests

21:07.299 --> 21:08.288
of my patient.

21:08.467 --> 21:09.934
Well, it looks like
you did wrong.

21:10.002 --> 21:12.027
No reason that pacemaker
should have failed.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.799
Why?
Because Suiter said so?

21:13.872 --> 21:15.931
Because I tested it myself.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.772
That model pacemaker
has a life of five years.

21:18.844 --> 21:20.869
The expiration date
on the battery was

21:20.946 --> 21:22.743
three years from now.

21:22.814 --> 21:24.782
I did not do anything wrong.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.114
Then why the sealed lips
the first time we came here?

21:27.185 --> 21:29.016
Mrs. Martinez's lawyer

21:29.087 --> 21:31.749
had already started
to drag me through court.

21:31.857 --> 21:34.621
Did you want me to
put bullets in his gun?

21:34.693 --> 21:36.354
Hellems knew
what he was buying,

21:36.428 --> 21:37.554
so Suiter's in the clear.

21:37.629 --> 21:38.618
Maybe not.

21:38.697 --> 21:39.686
Here, you want one?

21:39.765 --> 21:41.426
Come on, these are
very good for you.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.627
No, I'll stick with
what Mother Nature gave me.

21:43.702 --> 21:44.691
Mmm.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.531
This pacemaker
had a life of five years.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.665
That first cardiologist,
Dr. Stark,

21:50.742 --> 21:53.142
said it was in Mrs. Barnet
for three years.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.804
That's right.
And Hellems said

21:56.882 --> 21:58.509
that when he implanted it
in Roberto,

21:58.583 --> 22:00.608
it had three years
left till expiration.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.347
How's your arithmetic?

22:02.421 --> 22:05.584
I know that three plus three
equals murder two.

22:07.559 --> 22:10.323
Last year we paid the bum
$130,000 in commissions.

22:10.395 --> 22:11.828
Still he's picking our pockets.

22:11.897 --> 22:14.161
The expiration date, please?

22:15.033 --> 22:16.432
Here we go.

22:17.769 --> 22:20.067
Oh, well, no wonder
the kid's dead.

22:20.205 --> 22:22.571
Expiration date, last December.

22:23.108 --> 22:25.099
I mean, that's malpractice.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.508
The doctor who implanted...

22:26.578 --> 22:27.840
Didrt know.

22:27.913 --> 22:28.902
What do you mean,

22:28.980 --> 22:30.447
Suiter changed
the expiration date?

22:30.515 --> 22:31.846
That's exactly what I mean.

22:31.917 --> 22:33.942
That stupid bastard
killed the boy.

22:37.422 --> 22:39.447
Gentlemen, don't get up.

22:41.460 --> 22:43.860
All that's missing
is a hunchback named Igor.

22:43.929 --> 22:46.659
<i>What the hell's the...
Can I help you?</i>

22:46.732 --> 22:47.824
Matter of fact, you can.

22:47.899 --> 22:49.423
Turn around,
put your hands together.

22:49.501 --> 22:51.435
Jeffrey Suiter,
you're under arrest

22:51.503 --> 22:52.970
for the murder of
Roberto Martinez.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.528
You have the right
to remain silent.

22:54.606 --> 22:56.767
Anything you do say can
and will be used against you

22:56.842 --> 22:57.831
in a court of law.

22:57.909 --> 22:59.001
I want to see my lawyer.

22:59.077 --> 23:00.374
I'm shocked.

23:03.348 --> 23:05.646
"Docket Number 594223.

23:05.751 --> 23:07.412
<i>"People v. Jeffrey Suiter.</i>

23:07.486 --> 23:10.011
"Charges are murder
in the second degree,

23:10.088 --> 23:11.953
grand larceny in
the third degree."

23:12.023 --> 23:13.490
The charges are bogus,
Your Honor.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.185
The state is wasting
the court's time.

23:15.260 --> 23:18.229
I'm grateful for
your concern, Ms. Adler.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.127
Does your client
wish to make a plea?

23:20.399 --> 23:22.424
Uh, not guilty, Your Honor.

23:22.501 --> 23:24.332
Color me surprised.

23:24.436 --> 23:26.097
Mr. Robinette?

23:26.238 --> 23:27.899
Request bail of $250,000.

23:28.807 --> 23:31.002
Now, Ms. Adler,
why don't you tell me

23:31.109 --> 23:33.976
all about the unconscionability
of the state's position.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.138
My client has
a business to run, Your Honor.

23:36.214 --> 23:37.408
He works on commission.

23:37.482 --> 23:39.677
Risk of flight
is less than minimal.

23:39.785 --> 23:41.844
Personally,
I can't understand why anyone

23:41.920 --> 23:43.911
would want to leave
our fair city.

23:43.989 --> 23:47.652
Bail is set at $100,000,
cash or bond.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.060
Mars creativity

23:50.128 --> 23:52.119
expands proportionately
to his greed.

23:52.330 --> 23:53.820
Stone's Law?

23:54.666 --> 23:56.361
No one ever went Chapter 11

23:56.435 --> 23:58.300
scamming his neighbor
out of a buck.

23:58.370 --> 24:01.168
Used pacemakers.
God forgive us.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.037
And an attorney's creativity
expands geometrically

24:04.142 --> 24:06.770
to the heinousness
of his client's crime.

24:06.845 --> 24:08.813
Adler's moving to
quash the indictment.

24:08.880 --> 24:12.145
Says we failed to present
evidence of causation.

24:13.051 --> 24:15.485
I like my law
better than yours.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.986
No one is disputing the fact

24:21.059 --> 24:22.890
that the pacemaker
malfunctioned.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.394
And I'm certainly not arguing

24:24.463 --> 24:25.862
that the malfunction
didn't cause

24:25.931 --> 24:27.125
Roberto Martinez's death.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.167
Mr. Suiter changed
the expiration date.

24:29.234 --> 24:31.498
Neither the doctor nor
the patient were informed.

24:31.570 --> 24:33.367
Thank you for
the play-by-play, Ben,

24:33.438 --> 24:34.837
but if you'd read my papers,

24:34.906 --> 24:36.897
you'd see I'm talking
about cause and effect.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.636
Or rather, the lack thereof.

24:38.710 --> 24:39.768
The boy died.

24:39.878 --> 24:42.108
But not because
the battery failed.

24:42.214 --> 24:45.513
Wait, was the gizmo
on the fritz or not?

24:45.584 --> 24:46.778
If I may, Your Honor.

24:46.852 --> 24:48.012
Ms. Kenny's
with the FDA.

24:48.086 --> 24:50.077
She examined
the pacemaker in question.

24:50.188 --> 24:51.246
Ms. Kenny?

24:51.356 --> 24:53.290
Nothing lasts forever.

24:53.625 --> 24:55.855
We require
expiration dates on pacemakers

24:55.927 --> 24:57.485
to prevent
overuse of batteries.

24:57.562 --> 24:59.553
In real life, that little
rabbit with the drum

24:59.631 --> 25:00.996
eventually goes kaput.

25:01.066 --> 25:02.397
Please, Ms. Adler.

25:02.467 --> 25:04.958
The date on the device
earmarks battery life

25:05.036 --> 25:06.196
and nothing else.

25:06.271 --> 25:07.704
Is there a point to this?

25:07.772 --> 25:10.263
Mr. Martinez's
pacemaker failed, yes,

25:10.342 --> 25:12.173
but not because
the battery was dead.

25:12.244 --> 25:13.905
It failed because the leads,

25:13.979 --> 25:16.413
the wires that get
woven into the heart,

25:16.481 --> 25:17.505
were corroded.

25:17.582 --> 25:20.050
The battery sent
the proper current.

25:20.118 --> 25:22.245
The heart never received it.

25:22.621 --> 25:24.316
This corrosion,

25:25.590 --> 25:27.956
could it have been
the result of the recycling?

25:28.059 --> 25:29.083
No, no.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.752
Mr. Suiter should have seen

25:30.829 --> 25:32.160
that those leads were corroded.

25:32.230 --> 25:34.664
This isn't a car battery,
Mr. Stone.

25:34.733 --> 25:36.894
These are very delicate wires.

25:36.968 --> 25:39.664
Sometimes corrosion is evident
on visual inspection,

25:39.738 --> 25:41.535
but with this
particular device,

25:41.606 --> 25:43.665
you would have to
run conductivity tests.

25:43.742 --> 25:45.300
And if he didn't
run those tests,

25:45.377 --> 25:46.571
then he was reckless.

25:46.645 --> 25:48.272
I've surveyed the industry.

25:48.346 --> 25:51.008
Not one manufacturer
runs conductivity tests

25:51.082 --> 25:52.447
in the normal course
of business.

25:52.517 --> 25:54.075
Wait a minute.

25:55.086 --> 25:57.452
This thing worked
for three years

25:57.522 --> 25:58.853
in the Barnet woman?

25:58.924 --> 26:00.551
That is no indication.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.388
When a corroded lead
will malfunction

26:02.460 --> 26:03.791
is at best a crap-shoot.

26:03.862 --> 26:05.386
The bottom line is

26:05.463 --> 26:07.454
my client's behavior was not

26:07.532 --> 26:09.625
the cause-in-fact
of Roberto's death.

26:09.701 --> 26:11.191
He changed the dates.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.271
So we'll plead to fraud.

26:13.338 --> 26:14.999
Your Honor, given some time...

26:15.106 --> 26:16.767
Give it up, Ben.

26:19.044 --> 26:21.376
You can't fight with the FDA.

26:22.213 --> 26:23.544
I'm dismissing

26:23.615 --> 26:25.674
with respect to
the murder charges.

26:26.685 --> 26:28.312
You come up with
something else,

26:29.387 --> 26:32.015
feel free to re-indict.

26:33.892 --> 26:36.622
He's playing three-card Monte
with people's hearts,

26:36.695 --> 26:38.219
and the best
we can do is fraud.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.127
Suiter is going to
enter a guilty plea.

26:40.198 --> 26:42.666
A lenient judge,
two years, tops.

26:42.734 --> 26:45.032
Our expert confirmed
the FDA's findings.

26:45.136 --> 26:47.366
The corrosion was unrelated
to the recycling.

26:47.472 --> 26:49.463
Yeah. Now, are you
saying that these wires

26:49.541 --> 26:51.133
were bad to begin with?

26:51.209 --> 26:52.471
No way of telling.

26:52.544 --> 26:53.806
I see.

26:54.346 --> 26:58.043
Well, if it was
a manufacturing defect,

26:58.383 --> 26:59.941
if the pacemaker
was originally sold

27:00.051 --> 27:01.609
with defective leads,

27:02.520 --> 27:04.818
we just might have
a case against BioNorm.

27:04.889 --> 27:05.913
A civil case.

27:06.024 --> 27:07.355
We've got one bad apple.

27:07.425 --> 27:08.517
At most, it's negligence.

27:08.593 --> 27:09.651
Not necessarily.

27:09.728 --> 27:12.561
We know that BioNorm settled
at least six other suits.

27:12.664 --> 27:16.225
Find out if those other apples
had corroded wires.

27:17.602 --> 27:19.035
When I was a kid,

27:19.104 --> 27:20.935
I used to look up at
buildings like this

27:21.006 --> 27:23.099
and dream about
meeting a prince

27:23.241 --> 27:24.902
and living in a penthouse.

27:26.011 --> 27:28.605
My prince showed up,
Mr. Robinette.

27:29.247 --> 27:31.078
His name was BioNorm.

27:31.182 --> 27:33.116
I'm sorry, but there is no way

27:33.184 --> 27:35.311
that I'm going to turn back
into being a frog.

27:35.420 --> 27:36.614
Part of your settlement was

27:36.688 --> 27:38.212
a non-disclosure
agreement?

27:38.323 --> 27:39.347
Uh-huh.

27:39.424 --> 27:42.291
I keep quiet, I keep all this.

27:42.527 --> 27:46.122
The terms of your settlement
may be covering up a crime.

27:46.231 --> 27:48.927
So you're going to arrest me
for obstruction?

27:49.034 --> 27:51.730
I dated an attorney
for three years.

27:51.970 --> 27:53.801
Look, all I know

27:53.872 --> 27:56.136
is that my dad's
pacemaker didn't work.

27:56.207 --> 27:57.970
I don't even know
what a lead is.

27:58.076 --> 28:00.806
Your father died,
and you didn't care why?

28:00.912 --> 28:03.278
My dad was no hero, okay?

28:03.515 --> 28:05.483
The best thing
he ever did was to die

28:05.550 --> 28:07.984
with one of those gizmos
attached to his ticker.

28:08.086 --> 28:09.713
I don't know about you,

28:09.788 --> 28:11.221
but I like Park Avenue

28:11.289 --> 28:13.519
a hell of a lot more
than Canarsie.

28:13.591 --> 28:16.287
One day, a man
from BioNorm shows up.

28:16.394 --> 28:18.919
Offers me $250,000.

28:18.997 --> 28:22.125
I settle faster than
you can say "gold card."

28:25.670 --> 28:27.001
Excuse me,
Mr. Stone?

28:27.138 --> 28:28.469
This just came in for you.

28:28.573 --> 28:30.063
Talked to all six families.

28:30.141 --> 28:31.608
All the pacemakers
were purchased

28:31.710 --> 28:33.678
around the same time.
They all failed.

28:33.778 --> 28:35.040
Because of corroded leads?

28:35.113 --> 28:36.512
Nobody ever pinpointed why.

28:36.581 --> 28:37.707
The lawsuits were settled

28:37.782 --> 28:39.340
before anybody
checked them out.

28:39.417 --> 28:41.442
Oh, sure, every good lawyer
always files a complaint

28:41.519 --> 28:43.419
before he knows
what the case is all about.

28:43.488 --> 28:45.479
BioNorm paid almost $2
million in hush money.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.422
Makes you think
they had something to hide.

28:47.492 --> 28:49.255
If it was the knowledge
of corroded leads

28:49.327 --> 28:51.318
then they were acting
with depraved indifference

28:51.396 --> 28:52.420
to human life,

28:52.497 --> 28:54.089
and that's seven counts
of murder two.

28:54.165 --> 28:55.291
Tough to prove.

28:55.366 --> 28:56.890
It's gonna take a smoking gun.

28:56.968 --> 28:58.458
Let's find one.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.797
O.P.P.
Other people's parts.

29:02.874 --> 29:04.569
We don't really
manufacture anything.

29:04.676 --> 29:07.543
We assemble, we package,
we market the hell out of it.

29:07.645 --> 29:08.873
Where do you get the leads?

29:08.947 --> 29:10.437
Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong,

29:10.515 --> 29:12.073
whoever's
the flavor of the month.

29:12.150 --> 29:13.481
Four years ago?

29:13.551 --> 29:15.314
I had eggs over easy
with sausage.

29:15.386 --> 29:18.514
Anything before that,
I'd have to consult my diary.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.490
I assume the company keeps one?

29:20.558 --> 29:22.549
You'd have to talk to
the purchasing agent.

29:22.627 --> 29:24.652
Four years ago,
that'd be Mrs. Cleary.

29:25.797 --> 29:27.128
The chairmars wife?

29:27.198 --> 29:29.029
Time was this
was a mum-and-pop.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.692
You requested a new
typewriter ribbon,

29:30.769 --> 29:32.031
you got it the same century.

29:37.075 --> 29:38.303
Yeah, Mum was

29:38.376 --> 29:40.241
the VP in charge of
purchasing back then.

29:40.311 --> 29:42.176
That was the good old days,
she calls it.

29:42.247 --> 29:44.442
I guess the, uh, view
on the way up the mountain

29:44.516 --> 29:46.416
is a lot better than
the view from the top.

29:46.484 --> 29:47.781
When did she leave the job?

29:47.852 --> 29:49.114
A couple or three years ago.

29:49.187 --> 29:50.154
Dad thought that

29:50.221 --> 29:52.121
she ought to enjoy
the fruits of his labor.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.488
My guess is that he thought
she was out of her league

29:54.559 --> 29:56.584
as soon as we got heavy
into medical technology.

29:56.661 --> 29:58.390
You didn't always
make pacemakers?

29:58.696 --> 30:00.857
We used to be called
the Ebbets Company.

30:00.932 --> 30:03.230
Grandpa was a Dodger fan.

30:03.368 --> 30:04.835
Your dad inerited the company?

30:04.903 --> 30:06.302
No, my mum.

30:06.404 --> 30:08.565
See, her dad
started the company

30:08.640 --> 30:10.733
when he was still
at Erasmus Hall.

30:11.709 --> 30:14.439
He, uh, fixed radios
in his bedroom.

30:14.712 --> 30:17.272
Then he graduated,
got into manufacturing.

30:17.382 --> 30:18.906
About the most
sophisticated product

30:18.983 --> 30:21.383
was, uh, an alarm
with a snooze button.

30:21.452 --> 30:23.317
A far cry from pacemakers.

30:23.454 --> 30:24.978
No, no, see, that was all Dad.

30:25.089 --> 30:27.182
See, uh, he married Mum,
moved the company

30:27.258 --> 30:28.691
across the river,
changed the name.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.388
Boom! We're grossing
$40 million a year.

30:31.462 --> 30:33.487
Not bad for
a hash-slinger's son

30:33.565 --> 30:35.624
with an MBA from City College.

30:37.335 --> 30:38.927
Uh, no, see, uh,

30:39.003 --> 30:41.335
back then we werert
buying wholesale.

30:41.773 --> 30:44.105
I can't tell you who
manufactured the leads.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.608
We bought them from an importer

30:45.677 --> 30:47.235
called Asian Pacific Trading.

30:49.814 --> 30:52.009
You're on the wrong track,
Mr. Robinette.

30:52.116 --> 30:53.879
I was a techie on
the assembly line.

30:53.952 --> 30:55.886
I checked
all those leads myself.

30:56.154 --> 30:58.679
I assure you,
everything was fine.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.622
Asian Pacific Trading.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.787
A DBA for a guy named Ziesel.

31:04.863 --> 31:05.989
You check him out?

31:06.097 --> 31:07.689
Gone with the wind
three years ago.

31:07.799 --> 31:09.266
No wonder
Steven Cleary was happy

31:09.334 --> 31:10.426
to give you his name.

31:10.501 --> 31:12.526
We'll never know
who manufactured the leads.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.367
Unless some other
pacemaker company

31:14.439 --> 31:16.737
purchased leads from
Asian Pacific Trading.

31:20.812 --> 31:22.245
We may not be the biggest,

31:22.313 --> 31:23.780
but there isn't
one medical journal

31:23.848 --> 31:26.180
that doesn't rate
our pacemakers the best.

31:28.786 --> 31:30.617
Do you manufacture
your own parts?

31:30.688 --> 31:32.087
Well, everything essential.

31:32.156 --> 31:34.090
The, uh, supporting cast
we contract out.

31:34.158 --> 31:35.182
Like leads.

31:35.293 --> 31:37.284
Yeah, we're high tech.
Why waste time and money

31:37.362 --> 31:39.159
making little wires, you know?

31:39.230 --> 31:41.824
This week we're buying
from Boyette in Akron.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.959
Four years ago,
you ever do business

31:44.035 --> 31:45.229
with an Asian Pacific Trading?

31:46.404 --> 31:48.804
A crook named Ziesel.
Took me for $50,000.

31:48.873 --> 31:51.034
New kid on the block.
Prices you could die for.

31:51.109 --> 31:53.737
Imported, uh, leads
made in Singapore.

31:53.811 --> 31:56.041
You know what company
manufactured those leads?

31:56.147 --> 31:59.048
CJL Electronics.
Usually a good company.

31:59.150 --> 32:00.549
What I figure happened was, uh,

32:00.618 --> 32:03.052
a shipload of
duds landed stateside

32:03.121 --> 32:05.851
and they pawned them off on
Asian Pacific for very little.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.518
Then Ziesel dumped them on me.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.584
Let me guess.
They were corroded.

32:10.695 --> 32:12.322
Yeah,
the shrink-wrapping stank.

32:12.397 --> 32:13.625
Sea air will do it every time.

32:13.698 --> 32:15.029
Most of them were useless.

32:15.099 --> 32:17.033
Did you use
the ones that werert?

32:17.101 --> 32:18.966
Be like playing
Russian roulette

32:19.037 --> 32:20.595
with people's lives.
I tossed them.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.003
We tried to sue Asian Pacific,

32:22.073 --> 32:23.506
but they were
nowhere to be found.

32:23.574 --> 32:24.700
And everyone in the business

32:24.776 --> 32:26.266
knew these leads
were defective?

32:26.344 --> 32:28.608
Uh, Ziesel told me
it was a one-shot deal.

32:28.713 --> 32:30.806
One package ship
filled with leads,

32:30.882 --> 32:32.975
and I was the only one
won'thy of his generosity.

32:33.051 --> 32:35.679
Lucky me.
The only sucker in town.

32:37.355 --> 32:39.915
Unfortunately, you werert.

32:41.059 --> 32:42.492
You mean someone else
bought them?

32:42.560 --> 32:45.859
Worse.
Someone else used them.

32:50.234 --> 32:52.099
Five companies
bought wire leads

32:52.170 --> 32:54.138
imported by
Asian Pacific Trading.

32:54.205 --> 32:55.832
One boatload, all garbage.

32:55.907 --> 32:57.204
It was a scam.
Each manufacturer

32:57.275 --> 32:59.607
thought that he was
the only one getting the deal.

32:59.677 --> 33:00.666
Uh-huh.

33:00.878 --> 33:03.403
But BioNorm is the only company

33:03.481 --> 33:05.244
that actually used

33:05.316 --> 33:07.147
the corroded wires.

33:07.352 --> 33:08.876
Depraved indifference.

33:08.953 --> 33:10.420
Shut the bastards down.

33:10.488 --> 33:11.853
It's not that easy.

33:11.956 --> 33:13.787
Are you telling me
that Cleary didn't know

33:13.858 --> 33:15.189
what was going on?

33:15.259 --> 33:16.988
Roger Cleary

33:17.195 --> 33:19.356
was all bottom lines
and check books.

33:19.430 --> 33:22.024
He didn't even set foot
on the manufacturing floor.

33:22.133 --> 33:23.828
Mrs. Cleary was the VP,

33:23.935 --> 33:26.199
but she wouldn't know a corroded
lead from a toaster oven.

33:27.805 --> 33:29.773
Somebody had to
authorize their use.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.934
As far as we can tell,
it's Steven, the kid.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.307
He's an electrical engineer.

33:33.378 --> 33:34.811
He admitted
doing the inspection.

33:34.879 --> 33:37.143
Only, at the time,
he was just a technician.

33:37.215 --> 33:39.445
Hardly a high managerial agent.

33:39.517 --> 33:40.814
So, under the statute,

33:40.885 --> 33:42.352
we can't prosecute
the corporation.

33:42.420 --> 33:44.479
Kid takes the blame,
the company's insulated.

33:44.555 --> 33:45.954
Yeah, if I had
a cover like that,

33:46.024 --> 33:47.616
I'd never catch cold.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.456
So, Steven Cleary
did cause BioNorm

33:50.561 --> 33:51.892
to act recklessly.

33:51.963 --> 33:53.396
The corporate veil.

33:53.464 --> 33:55.557
It protects them
from civil liability.

33:55.633 --> 33:58.864
But that doesn't stretch
to our side of the street.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.961
So let's indict him
for murder two.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.666
Do you think that Steven Cleary

34:02.740 --> 34:04.071
acted on his own?

34:04.375 --> 34:06.309
Well, I'm gonna
shake the family tree,

34:06.377 --> 34:07.776
see what falls out.

34:07.845 --> 34:10.746
"Docket Number 581739.

34:10.848 --> 34:14.511
<i>"People of the State of New
York v. Steven R. Cleary.</i>

34:14.819 --> 34:17.310
Charge is murder in
the second degree."

34:17.388 --> 34:19.083
Do we have a plea, gentlemen?

34:19.190 --> 34:21.351
Motion to dismiss
the charges, Your Honor.

34:21.426 --> 34:22.791
A little out of
our neighborhood,

34:22.860 --> 34:23.985
aren't we, Mr. Berkley?

34:24.062 --> 34:25.824
Well, BioNorm has
been a corporate client

34:25.897 --> 34:26.886
for the last decade.

34:26.964 --> 34:28.329
We intend to institute

34:28.399 --> 34:30.128
malicious prosecution charges.

34:30.201 --> 34:31.498
Well, I'm happy for you.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.661
But read the sign
on the door, sir.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.898
This is the criminal part.

34:36.174 --> 34:38.438
Only two choices on our menu.

34:38.543 --> 34:39.771
Not guilty.

34:39.877 --> 34:42.004
Application, Mr. Robinette?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.674
Bail in the amount
of $250,000, Your Honor.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.080
So be it.

34:46.184 --> 34:47.674
This isn't even
your party, Ben.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.117
This is a corporate matter.

34:49.187 --> 34:50.415
We should be in civil court.

34:50.521 --> 34:52.512
When seven people
end up dead, Richard,

34:52.590 --> 34:53.989
I send out
engraved invitations.

34:54.058 --> 34:56.219
Ah. He was working on
the assembly line,

34:56.293 --> 34:57.318
for crying out loud.

34:57.395 --> 34:59.192
There's no way
he's criminally liable.

34:59.263 --> 35:00.787
He is if he
caused a corporation

35:00.898 --> 35:02.297
to perform a criminal act.

35:02.366 --> 35:04.857
Penal code, section 2025.

35:07.572 --> 35:09.836
Look, the kid was
six months out of MIT.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.068
Now, do you actually think

35:12.143 --> 35:13.667
that he had
the authority to cause

35:13.744 --> 35:15.302
the corporation to do anything?

35:15.480 --> 35:17.277
He okayed the use
of defective wires.

35:17.348 --> 35:19.111
Seven people died.

35:19.217 --> 35:20.775
All right, reality, fellows.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.752
There is no way
that you are gonna get

35:22.820 --> 35:24.788
the evidence of
the first six cases admitted.

35:24.889 --> 35:26.254
And the jury
will see the seventh

35:26.324 --> 35:27.484
as simple negligence.
Period.

35:27.558 --> 35:29.048
What you call
simple negligence,

35:29.127 --> 35:31.925
the jury may call depraved
indifference to human life

35:31.996 --> 35:35.830
and the penal code calls that
murder in the second degree.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.635
The sole reason for
the malfunction

35:42.707 --> 35:44.436
was that the device
had corroded leads.

35:44.509 --> 35:46.500
The electrical impulse
generated by the battery

35:46.577 --> 35:47.976
never reached the boy's heart.

35:48.045 --> 35:49.137
And in your expert opinion,

35:49.213 --> 35:50.771
what was the cause
of the corrosion?

35:50.848 --> 35:53.180
Most probably it was
exposure during shipping.

35:53.251 --> 35:54.616
Thank you.

35:56.821 --> 35:57.845
Now, tell me,
Ms. Kenny,

35:57.922 --> 35:59.549
in your role as FDA inspector,

35:59.624 --> 36:02.024
did you approve
BioNorm's pacemaker?

36:02.326 --> 36:04.317
I inspected the design proposal

36:04.395 --> 36:06.454
and the prototype.
Both were first-rate.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.655
First-rate.
Did you ever follow up?

36:08.766 --> 36:11.064
Did you make random checks,
for example?

36:11.469 --> 36:12.663
That's not feasible.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.032
No, it's not feasible,

36:14.105 --> 36:16.039
but it would be prudent,
wouldn't it?

36:16.474 --> 36:18.135
In a perfect world, but...

36:18.209 --> 36:20.473
Yes, but this isn't a perfect
world, is it, Ms. Kenny?

36:20.545 --> 36:23.378
People make mistakes.
People make mistakes.

36:23.447 --> 36:25.881
Even some kid
working on an assembly line

36:25.950 --> 36:27.747
in a pacemaker factory.

36:27.818 --> 36:29.285
Objection.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.214
Keep the meditations
to a minimum, Counselor.

36:32.356 --> 36:33.380
Sustained.

36:33.457 --> 36:35.186
No more questions.

36:35.459 --> 36:37.518
We've been
in the pacemaker business

36:37.595 --> 36:39.085
for over 20 years.

36:39.163 --> 36:41.631
This Asian Pacific Trading
comes along

36:41.699 --> 36:43.223
and offers to
sell us wire leads

36:43.301 --> 36:46.293
at a quarter of the price
of our usual supplier.

36:46.370 --> 36:47.667
Well, what can I say?

36:47.805 --> 36:49.136
Of course, I bought them.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.231
Uh, did you use

36:50.308 --> 36:51.900
these wire leads
in your pacemakers?

36:51.976 --> 36:53.739
No way.
They come off the boat,

36:53.844 --> 36:56.312
I can see myself that
half of them are corroded.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.314
<i>And I haven't been
20l20 for 20 years.</i>

36:58.382 --> 37:00.145
But did you use the other half?

37:00.218 --> 37:01.685
Absolutely not.

37:01.752 --> 37:04.653
The components were garbage,
and that's where they went.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.656
Wasrt that expensive?

37:06.924 --> 37:08.949
Well, we're in
the medical business.

37:09.093 --> 37:11.152
Market share's not won'th
killing people.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.628
How does your market share

37:12.697 --> 37:14.221
compare to that of BioNorm's?

37:15.766 --> 37:18.257
Theirs is growing.
Ours isn't.

37:18.536 --> 37:20.094
Would you explain that?

37:20.204 --> 37:22.069
You buy cheap, you sell cheap.

37:22.173 --> 37:24.539
They've been undercutting
our prices for years.

37:24.609 --> 37:25.974
Thank you.

37:28.613 --> 37:29.773
I suppose you read

37:29.847 --> 37:31.212
the medical journals,
Mr. Miller?

37:31.282 --> 37:32.374
Yes.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.577
Now, have you ever read
an article questioning

37:34.652 --> 37:36.984
the quality of
BioNorm's products?

37:37.321 --> 37:38.447
No.

37:38.556 --> 37:41.150
No. Do you have any
first-hand knowledge

37:41.259 --> 37:44.422
of any of BioNorm's
instruments malfunctioning?

37:45.463 --> 37:47.294
Other than this one, no.

37:47.398 --> 37:49.298
No. So perhaps, sir,

37:49.400 --> 37:51.061
BioNorm has
a better market share

37:51.135 --> 37:54.434
because BioNorm builds
a better mousetrap.

37:58.276 --> 38:01.268
I was purchasing agent
for BioNorm Industries

38:01.345 --> 38:03.745
until the summer of 1988.

38:03.814 --> 38:05.907
Then you were
responsible for purchasing

38:05.983 --> 38:07.780
wire leads for BioNorm

38:07.852 --> 38:09.479
from the Asian
Pacific Trading Company,

38:09.553 --> 38:10.611
is that correct?

38:10.688 --> 38:12.918
It's been a long time.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.692
Do you recognize this document?

38:19.463 --> 38:23.024
Lt-it's a purchase order
for 500 gross of wire leads

38:23.134 --> 38:25.261
from Asian Pacific Trading.

38:25.336 --> 38:26.701
Is that your signature?

38:27.471 --> 38:28.733
Yes.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.103
I move to have this

38:30.174 --> 38:31.971
admitted into evidence,
Your Honor.

38:32.043 --> 38:33.670
Call it
"People's 17."

38:33.778 --> 38:36.372
Mrs. Cleary, did you
inspect the wire leads

38:36.447 --> 38:38.779
that BioNorm purchased from
Asian Pacific Trading Company?

38:38.849 --> 38:42.080
Only to determine
if the quantity was correct.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.280
Anything more, I wouldn't know.

38:44.355 --> 38:45.822
Thank you.

38:46.524 --> 38:49.015
Our products are
the best on the market.

38:49.126 --> 38:51.060
The settlement offer
was a business decision,

38:51.128 --> 38:52.254
pure and simple.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.231
It's more cost-effective to
nip a nuisance suit in the bud.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.459
A nuisance?

38:56.534 --> 38:57.626
A boy died

38:57.702 --> 39:00.398
because your company
used defective components,

39:00.471 --> 39:01.904
and you call it a nuisance?

39:02.006 --> 39:03.530
I didn't know
anything about that.

39:03.641 --> 39:05.871
Did you personally
inspect the leads, sir?

39:05.976 --> 39:07.841
Well, it's not
my area of expertise.

39:07.945 --> 39:09.276
You hired someone to do it?

39:09.347 --> 39:10.405
That's right.

39:10.481 --> 39:12.312
Whom did you hire
to inspect the leads

39:12.383 --> 39:14.476
purchased from
Asian Pacific Trading Company?

39:14.552 --> 39:16.076
No, sir.

39:16.187 --> 39:19.156
No way you get me to help you
convict my own son.

39:19.223 --> 39:21.088
Excuse me, sir,
I think you just did.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.591
Objection.

39:26.564 --> 39:29.089
I inspected the leads
very carefully

39:29.166 --> 39:31.430
in order to weed out
the bad ones.

39:31.502 --> 39:33.493
And you feel you have
sufficient expertise

39:33.571 --> 39:35.539
to distinguish
good leads from bad?

39:35.606 --> 39:37.574
I'm an electrical engineer.

39:37.641 --> 39:39.472
I've been dealing
with wires my whole life.

39:39.543 --> 39:41.204
Your degree in
electrical engineering

39:41.278 --> 39:43.041
is from MIT, isn't that right?

39:43.114 --> 39:44.809
My parents started contributing

39:44.882 --> 39:46.543
to the alumni fund
the day I was born.

39:46.617 --> 39:49.882
And even with this expertise
and a very careful inspection,

39:49.954 --> 39:52.548
a single bad wire got through.

39:56.293 --> 39:58.693
Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry. I...

39:59.864 --> 40:01.889
I, you know, I did my best.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.425
L... I did everything that...

40:05.936 --> 40:08.461
I have no idea
how this happened.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.768
A single bad wire,
Mr. Cleary?

40:14.845 --> 40:15.937
What about the six other...

40:16.013 --> 40:17.310
Objection!

40:17.381 --> 40:19.713
Your Honor, may we approach?

40:23.154 --> 40:25.281
Your Honor, six other
pacemakers

40:25.356 --> 40:27.256
manufactured
at the same time all failed.

40:27.324 --> 40:28.586
You have no proof of that.

40:28.659 --> 40:30.251
They settled those cases

40:30.327 --> 40:32.261
before anyone
could find out what happened

40:32.329 --> 40:33.421
and if the jury knew this...

40:33.497 --> 40:34.657
They'd be prejudiced.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.393
Defense objection is sustained.

40:41.372 --> 40:42.339
Berkley's good.

40:42.406 --> 40:44.237
Good enough
to convince the jury

40:44.308 --> 40:45.570
it was an isolated mistake.

40:45.643 --> 40:48.339
Steven Cleary looks negligent,
not criminal.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.414
What Steven Cleary did
was criminal.

40:50.481 --> 40:52.244
Why he did it...

40:52.583 --> 40:54.574
He can go to hell and back
for his father,

40:54.652 --> 40:56.677
but I'm not so sure
the reverse is true.

40:56.854 --> 40:59.982
Unfortunately, Roger Cleary
is not on trial.

41:00.090 --> 41:01.421
Maybe it's not so unfortunate.

41:01.492 --> 41:03.585
Steven said his parents
started contributing

41:03.661 --> 41:05.754
to the MIT alumni fund
the day he was born.

41:05.930 --> 41:08.694
But he also said his father
went to City College at night.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.232
Like mother, like son, huh?

41:10.301 --> 41:11.427
Exactly.

41:11.502 --> 41:13.629
Get Steven Cleary in here.

41:14.338 --> 41:16.033
Well, so what
if she did go to MIT?

41:16.106 --> 41:17.767
It has nothing to do
with your case.

41:17.842 --> 41:19.366
You mean "cases."

41:19.477 --> 41:22.275
Mrs. Cleary has a B.S.
In electrical engineering.

41:22.346 --> 41:25.543
It certainly qualifies her
to inspect wire leads.

41:25.649 --> 41:27.139
She's a Vice President

41:27.218 --> 41:29.311
capable of authorizing
their use.

41:29.386 --> 41:30.785
We're going after
the corporation

41:30.855 --> 41:32.152
and your mother.

41:32.223 --> 41:34.555
Well, if you're so confident,
why are we here?

41:34.658 --> 41:37.286
Steven, we know your mother
put you up to this.

41:37.361 --> 41:40.956
If you testify against her,
we can work something out.

41:41.232 --> 41:42.699
Steven, let's go.

41:44.735 --> 41:46.532
I'll have your mother arrested

41:46.604 --> 41:48.663
when she arrives
at the courthouse.

41:51.208 --> 41:52.505
People have died, Steven.

41:52.576 --> 41:54.203
I know you didn't
look them in the eye

41:54.278 --> 41:56.303
when you killed them,
but they're just as dead.

41:56.380 --> 41:57.312
Ben.

41:57.381 --> 41:58.871
Why are you taking
the fall for her?

41:58.949 --> 41:59.973
Look, my mother...

42:00.050 --> 42:01.415
Steven, come on.

42:07.558 --> 42:08.650
Okay.

42:09.593 --> 42:11.527
You'll testify against her?

42:11.595 --> 42:14.462
No, I want a deal
for me and my mother.

42:15.132 --> 42:17.566
I'll testify against my father.

42:34.552 --> 42:37.077
We spent days sorting out
all the bad ones.

42:37.154 --> 42:38.985
You and your mother?

42:39.990 --> 42:42.254
We thought we got them all.

42:44.094 --> 42:46.460
After the first person died,

42:47.398 --> 42:49.366
we ran conductivity tests

42:49.433 --> 42:51.458
on all the pacemakers
remaining in stock.

42:52.670 --> 42:54.763
A lot of the wire leads

42:54.838 --> 42:57.136
that we thought
were good, werert.

43:00.778 --> 43:04.179
We... we begged my father
to recall all the pacemakers

43:04.248 --> 43:06.375
that used Asian Pacific leads.

43:06.951 --> 43:08.578
And he refused?

43:11.121 --> 43:13.681
He was too busy
building an empire.

43:15.459 --> 43:16.790
You know, my father promised me

43:16.860 --> 43:18.452
that all this would go away.

43:19.129 --> 43:21.529
That I'd have the best lawyers.

43:22.666 --> 43:25.294
He told me
I owed it to the family.

43:27.171 --> 43:28.695
So, people are walking around

43:28.772 --> 43:30.433
with time bombs
in their chests.

43:30.507 --> 43:32.236
And at least seven exploded.

43:32.309 --> 43:33.640
You cut a deal?

43:33.711 --> 43:34.837
Man one.
He does the minimum.

43:34.912 --> 43:35.844
Man one...

43:35.913 --> 43:36.880
Adam.

43:36.947 --> 43:39.040
It's the only way he'll talk.
He turns on the mother,

43:39.116 --> 43:40.481
the mother turns on the father.

43:40.551 --> 43:42.985
His testimony alone is useless.

43:44.488 --> 43:46.683
She denies it, we all go home.

43:46.757 --> 43:48.691
She'll let him
take the rap alone?

43:49.960 --> 43:51.655
Today is different
from yesterday.

43:51.729 --> 43:53.287
He said she had knowledge.

43:53.364 --> 43:56.856
Just because the boy says
she had technical knowledge,

43:56.967 --> 44:00.027
doesn't mean that she knew
what the hell was going on.

44:00.137 --> 44:02.571
The lawyer tells the jury,

44:02.706 --> 44:05.470
the kid is a rat in a trap
looking for a scapegoat.

44:05.542 --> 44:07.169
Steven Cleary is on the edge.

44:07.244 --> 44:08.643
We push him a little harder.

44:08.746 --> 44:10.577
Only he's already got a deal.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.377
For the death of
Roberto Martinez.

44:12.483 --> 44:14.314
We still got
six other deaths to deal with.

44:14.385 --> 44:18.185
Let's get the boy and his
mother in here tomorrow morning.

44:19.490 --> 44:20.752
This is crap.

44:21.091 --> 44:23.616
You werert invited, sir,
and unless you're a lawyer,

44:23.694 --> 44:25.184
I'd appreciate it
if you keep quiet.

44:25.262 --> 44:27.526
This is my family, my business.

44:27.598 --> 44:28.929
If you had any proof,

44:28.999 --> 44:30.432
you would have
charged them before.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.492
Before, we didn't
have Stevers testimony

44:32.569 --> 44:34.560
as to the cause of
the other deaths.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.503
Five counts of murder two.

44:36.640 --> 44:38.505
Minimum on each, 25 years.

44:38.575 --> 44:39.837
Oh, my God!

44:39.910 --> 44:40.934
He's bluffing.

44:41.011 --> 44:43.036
He's trying to drive
a wedge between us.

44:43.113 --> 44:45.911
Mrs. Cleary,
I can and I will prosecute

44:45.983 --> 44:48.417
your son to
the fullest extent of the law.

44:50.120 --> 44:53.089
I'm offering you a chance
to salvage your sors life.

44:53.190 --> 44:54.589
We can beat this, Annette.

44:54.658 --> 44:56.023
Don't let him destroy us.

44:56.093 --> 44:58.789
You did that yourself,
Roger, four years ago.

44:58.896 --> 45:01.023
If you confirm
Stevers testimony,

45:01.098 --> 45:02.656
I can offer you both a deal.

45:02.733 --> 45:04.997
God, Annette,
think of what this means.

45:05.069 --> 45:06.832
My business,
everything I've worked for.

45:06.904 --> 45:09.964
Your business?
You were nothing.

45:10.274 --> 45:11.332
My father...

45:11.408 --> 45:12.466
Your father fixed toasters.

45:12.543 --> 45:13.532
He worked for me.

45:13.610 --> 45:17.046
That's right, Dad.
He worked for you.

45:17.815 --> 45:19.749
We all worked for you.

45:21.151 --> 45:22.948
And here we are.

45:23.053 --> 45:25.578
Just look
what you've done for us.

45:32.096 --> 45:33.586
Mrs. Cleary?

45:45.743 --> 45:47.836
What do I need to do?

45:52.282 --> 45:53.306
You.

45:54.351 --> 45:56.945
You couldn't keep
your mouth shut.

45:57.121 --> 45:58.884
Two years in jail,

45:59.423 --> 46:01.653
you could have
walked out a wealthy man.

46:03.393 --> 46:05.884
All right, Mr. Stone,
I'm a businessman.

46:05.996 --> 46:07.987
I've made deals before.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.791
What are you offering?

46:11.368 --> 46:13.199
I'm not a businessman,
Mr. Cleary.

46:13.270 --> 46:15.170
I'm offering you nothing.

46:17.574 --> 46:19.508
If he's smart, he pleads guilty

46:19.576 --> 46:21.476
and begs the court
for mercy in sentencing.

46:21.545 --> 46:24.343
Six counts of murder two?
Even with a lenient judge

46:24.414 --> 46:27.577
he dies of old age and still
owes the state 50 years.

46:27.684 --> 46:28.776
What amazes me is that

46:28.852 --> 46:31.377
he almost convinced his son
to do 25-to-life.

46:31.455 --> 46:32.945
Must have given him
quite a lecture

46:33.023 --> 46:34.285
on family values.
