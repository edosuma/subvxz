WEBVTT

00:12.083 --> 00:14.875
NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:34.500 --> 00:37.958
<i>Welcome to Tellería. Today is the day!</i>

00:46.125 --> 00:47.625
Tellería is a Castilian town

00:47.708 --> 00:50.625
located in the heart of the Basque Country
since the Middle Ages.

00:50.708 --> 00:53.875
This peculiar settlement's
culture and idiosyncrasy

00:53.958 --> 00:55.875
are a hundred percent Basque.

00:55.958 --> 00:58.750
But this unwonted situation
will end today.

00:58.833 --> 01:03.042
<i>Lehendakari</i> Txomin Iturraspe
is expected to arrive any second now,

01:03.125 --> 01:07.458
who is going to announce that Tellería
will become a part of the Basque Country.

01:07.542 --> 01:10.583
-Long live Euskadi!
-Hurrah!

01:10.667 --> 01:13.583
-You must be excited, Mr. Mayor.
-Very excited.

01:14.333 --> 01:16.833
It has been nearly 700 years.

01:16.917 --> 01:19.292
But that just goes to show
that we are truly Basque.

01:19.375 --> 01:23.125
Our tenacity, our culture,
because we feel it.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.750
And like you always say,
because of tax benefits.

01:25.833 --> 01:26.792
That's what I'm talking about.

01:26.875 --> 01:30.125
Say all you want, the truth is
we belong to Burgos, just like morcilla.

01:30.208 --> 01:34.375
Sure, especially you.
The fucking half-Swiss Cantabrian.

01:34.458 --> 01:36.167
Cantabria is a recent invention.

01:36.250 --> 01:38.667
Santander was always Old Castile's port.

01:38.750 --> 01:41.250
And I moved to Switzerland
because I had no choice.

01:42.417 --> 01:45.792
It looks like there are differences
of opinion in town, Mr. Mayor.

01:46.875 --> 01:51.542
Just a few. And they're all treated
with tolerance and respect.

01:51.625 --> 01:54.917
Move the Basque flag a little bit
to the right so they can see it better.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.125
Look alive!

01:56.958 --> 01:58.792
And out with the Castilian one!

02:01.125 --> 02:02.375
Where's Nathalie?

02:02.458 --> 02:04.958
Something must've happened to her.
She's always on time.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.542
-Damn it!
-As soon as the <i>lehendakari</i> gets here,

02:06.625 --> 02:08.542
you start waving those flags, okay?

02:08.625 --> 02:10.208
Nathalie, where were you?

02:10.292 --> 02:12.667
-What's up with your hair? What happened?
-Help me.

02:12.750 --> 02:15.375
Put some effort into it!
You gotta look Basque!

02:15.458 --> 02:18.042
Bernabé, get rid of the kid
with the Spanish jersey.

02:18.125 --> 02:18.958
Yes.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.292
It doesn't matter
if you get rid of that kid,

02:22.375 --> 02:24.583
-we're still Spaniards.
<i>-Aitá,</i> will you let me do my job?

02:24.667 --> 02:28.042
Not <i>"aitá."</i> "Dad."
Besides, you're not Basque.

02:28.125 --> 02:29.583
You were born in Switzerland.

02:29.667 --> 02:32.250
We have to arrange these people
before the <i>lehendakari</i> gets here.

02:32.333 --> 02:33.417
-Can I ask--
-Not now.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.042
-Here he comes! He's here!
-The<i> lehendakari!</i>

02:36.833 --> 02:38.500
-It's okay.
-You gotta fix that.

02:50.833 --> 02:53.958
Where's the <i>lehendakari?</i>
They sent Gumucio. This smells fishy.

02:54.042 --> 02:57.417
After all the trouble we went through
to get the press here, they send him.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.042
-He has no authority.
-God damn it!

02:59.542 --> 03:02.167
Let's not panic. Stick to the plan.

03:05.125 --> 03:06.708
Welcome to Tellería.

03:07.542 --> 03:09.958
Antolín Intxausti, mayor of Tellería.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.167
Here to serve God,

03:12.250 --> 03:14.542
the <i>lehendakari</i> and you.

03:14.625 --> 03:16.958
Come on, Mr. Mayor, we know each other.

03:17.042 --> 03:19.042
What's going on here?
Are you celebrating the town fair?

03:20.417 --> 03:23.042
Could I speak to you in private
for a minute?

03:23.125 --> 03:24.042
In private?

03:24.750 --> 03:26.167
What we need to discuss here

03:26.250 --> 03:29.125
is something the entire town
and all of Spain should hear.

03:29.958 --> 03:30.833
Come on.

03:31.875 --> 03:34.958
-Nathalie. I'll be here if there's...
-Cool.

03:35.042 --> 03:35.917
Okay?

03:37.708 --> 03:40.208
-Long live Tellería!
-Hurrah!

03:40.292 --> 03:42.417
-Long live Euskadi!
-Hurrah!

03:45.333 --> 03:47.167
<i>Lehendakari!</i>

03:50.875 --> 03:52.833
The <i>lehendakari</i> couldn't make it today.

03:53.292 --> 03:58.167
But Mr. Gumucio is here as
a representative of the Basque Government

03:58.250 --> 04:01.792
to legalize what we've always known.

04:03.125 --> 04:05.292
That we were, we are,
and will always be Basque.

04:05.375 --> 04:06.875
That we were, we are,

04:06.958 --> 04:09.583
and will always be Basque.

04:10.167 --> 04:11.125
Yes!

04:13.833 --> 04:15.792
Mr. Gumucio will speak now.

04:15.875 --> 04:17.958
Ari, ari, ari, Antolín for <i>lehendakari!</i>

04:18.042 --> 04:19.292
Good morning.

04:20.792 --> 04:23.375
As you all know, the Gasteiz government

04:23.875 --> 04:27.792
-has always asserted the Basqueness...
-Hey! Put that down!

04:27.875 --> 04:28.833
of Tellería.

04:28.917 --> 04:30.458
Well, I wouldn't say always.

04:30.542 --> 04:32.875
Dude, shut up! This is a historic day!

04:32.958 --> 04:34.667
-Tellería!
-Hurrah!

04:34.750 --> 04:38.333
However, I must announce
there has been a small alteration.

04:40.167 --> 04:43.042
We have reached
a profitable economic agreement

04:43.125 --> 04:44.875
with the Government of Castile-León

04:44.958 --> 04:46.917
to expand Basque companies

04:47.000 --> 04:50.083
in strategic territories
such as Las Batuecas

04:50.167 --> 04:51.917
-or El Bierzo.
-What? You can't do that!

04:52.000 --> 04:53.583
-This is not Castile!
-Here we go again.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.792
-And what's that got to do with us?
-Exactly.

04:55.875 --> 04:57.458
What's that got to do with us?

04:57.542 --> 04:59.333
It means we're still Castilian.

04:59.417 --> 05:02.250
You're so annoying, Revuelta.
You sound like a broken record.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.583
In return for this
extremely profitable agreement

05:05.667 --> 05:07.958
which benefits every one of us,

05:08.333 --> 05:11.208
what the government asks of us is...

05:14.125 --> 05:17.250
that we cease to demand that Tellería
be declared a Basque settlement.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.042
What did he say?

05:21.083 --> 05:23.750
No matter how much you insist,
you will not be Basque.

05:27.833 --> 05:29.250
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

05:44.417 --> 05:47.958
THE LITTLE SWITZERLAND

05:48.042 --> 05:50.125
<i>Moving on to local news.</i>

05:50.208 --> 05:52.083
<i>Tellería, the Castilian settlement</i>

05:52.167 --> 05:54.292
<i>located in the heart of the Basque Country</i>
<i>will receive the visit</i>

05:54.375 --> 05:55.958
<i>of a Basque representative</i>
<i>in order to study the annexation...</i>

05:56.042 --> 05:56.875
TWO HOURS EARLIER

05:56.958 --> 05:59.333
<i>...to this territory</i>
<i>after being a part of Castile...</i>

05:59.417 --> 06:01.083
Shit, that was today?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.958
I bet the town is in an uproar.

06:04.917 --> 06:05.750
I knew it.

06:06.042 --> 06:08.625
We should've gone to Frías.
There's plenty of work there.

06:08.708 --> 06:10.708
Well, I haven't called home in days.

06:10.792 --> 06:13.333
Besides, the Sanctuary of the Dull
is a mile away from the town center.

06:13.417 --> 06:14.833
We won't hear a thing.

06:18.333 --> 06:19.542
Don't even think about it.

06:19.625 --> 06:22.000
Keep your eyes on the road.
I'll read the messages for you.

06:22.083 --> 06:24.917
-Don't you dare look!
-I won't look. Just keep driving.

06:26.250 --> 06:27.750
There's a spot on my glasses.

06:28.583 --> 06:30.625
LONG LIVE EUSKADI
TELLERÍA

06:30.708 --> 06:32.792
I booked a room at the Lucerna Inn.

06:33.375 --> 06:35.875
What about you?
Are you going to stay at your parents'?

06:35.958 --> 06:36.792
Me? Yeah.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.083
I'll pay them a visit.

06:38.875 --> 06:39.875
Right.

06:40.417 --> 06:42.917
Yolanda, you know you can stay with us
if you want.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.625
Oh, no. No.

06:44.708 --> 06:45.917
-I mean, no offense.
-No.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.333
-I'd rather do my own thing.
-Of course.

06:48.417 --> 06:50.500
Besides, you know how Pancorbo turned out.

06:50.583 --> 06:53.750
We were going to spend a few days there,
but we stayed for two months.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.292
Yolanda, please,
keep your eyes on the road!

06:58.375 --> 07:00.208
Gorka, stop it! You're being sexist.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.417
That's right! That's a sign of sexism.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.125
You can't keep your hand
off that handgrip.

07:05.208 --> 07:08.542
I just don't want us to crash, okay?
So keep your eyes on the road.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.167
-Yolanda, what did I just say?
-It's okay.

07:11.250 --> 07:12.500
-It'll be a second.
-Keep your eyes on the road.

07:12.583 --> 07:14.792
-Give me the phone.
-No way. Don't tell me what--

07:15.292 --> 07:16.292
God.

07:20.125 --> 07:21.625
-Your nose.
-What a blow.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.208
-I'm bleeding out.
-Look at me.

07:23.292 --> 07:24.458
-Is it broken?
-I don't know.

07:24.542 --> 07:26.042
-Is it broken? Red?
-It looks red.

07:26.125 --> 07:28.958
-Do you feel dizzy? Follow my finger.
-No.

07:29.042 --> 07:30.333
-Yolanda, please.
-Look into my eyes.

07:30.417 --> 07:31.500
Are you okay?

07:33.125 --> 07:34.833
Yes. I'm okay.

07:35.458 --> 07:36.875
I'm great.

07:37.667 --> 07:38.750
All right, then.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.583
-If you're okay, let's go.
-Yeah, let's go.

07:42.667 --> 07:44.875
I can't wait for you to meet Mr. Anselmo.

07:44.958 --> 07:47.875
You'll see, he's an amazing person.
A role model. A saint.

07:51.167 --> 07:53.375
What do you think? Pretty cool, huh?

07:53.458 --> 07:56.000
Careful with that, Father.
They're devilishly dangerous.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.083
Mr. Anselmo.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.833
-Mr. Anselmo!
-What's up, Gorka?

08:11.208 --> 08:12.208
Thanks.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.583
Cover the girl.

08:14.333 --> 08:15.292
Come on.

08:16.125 --> 08:17.042
Let's go.

08:17.125 --> 08:18.292
Come on.

08:18.375 --> 08:20.833
Is the weather always like this?
It was sunny moments ago.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.208
That's just a rain cloud.
It'll clear up soon.

08:23.292 --> 08:24.417
Leave your stuff here.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.292
-Gorka!
-Mr. Anselmo.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.417
Little Gorka, it's so good to see you.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.000
-It's been so long.
-Yeah.

08:30.083 --> 08:32.542
How come you didn't even show up
for Saint Roch's celebrations?

08:32.625 --> 08:34.208
-Well...
-Scared of coming back to Tellería?

08:34.292 --> 08:35.125
You know it.

08:36.125 --> 08:39.458
-What happened to your nose?
-It's nothing. Just a little accident.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.500
Yolanda, come here so I can introduce you.

08:43.792 --> 08:47.458
Anselmo Martínez de Salinas, town priest
and Tellería's spiritual mentor.

08:47.542 --> 08:49.667
Yolanda Penedo, art historian.

08:49.750 --> 08:50.958
Nice to meet you.

08:51.042 --> 08:52.500
This is... Wow!

08:53.417 --> 08:55.125
She specializes in heritage.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.375
-She's the one you did your master's with?
-Yes.

08:59.042 --> 09:00.333
Come on, let's go!

09:01.917 --> 09:03.833
The Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Dull.

09:03.917 --> 09:06.125
Sixteenth century. Basque Gothic style.

09:06.208 --> 09:07.583
Inspired by the German <i>hallenkirchen.</i>

09:07.667 --> 09:10.250
The altarpiece
is from the Proto-Renaissance period.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.250
You still haven't received government aid?

09:12.333 --> 09:14.083
They don't give a damn about us.

09:15.125 --> 09:16.750
Well, Father, they sent us.

09:16.833 --> 09:18.167
Thousands like you have come through here.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.292
Most recently,
some archeologists from Vitoria.

09:20.375 --> 09:22.958
Look at what they did to my church.
It's been like this for a year.

09:23.042 --> 09:24.000
I'm very unhappy with them.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.250
Especially with their boss,
Peio Etxeberria.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.167
The paleographer?

09:27.250 --> 09:31.125
Paleographer, archeologist, art historian.
A prominent figure. He was my teacher.

09:31.208 --> 09:34.792
-So, did they find anything interesting?
-Just a few bones.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.375
And the foundations of the old
Romanesque church. Or so they say.

09:37.458 --> 09:39.417
What's wrong with you? You're bleeding.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.042
Come to the sacristy.
Come on, you're bleeding!

09:42.458 --> 09:45.042
-I'll be right back, Yolanda!
-Move.

09:45.625 --> 09:47.083
Leave Yolanda alone.

09:47.167 --> 09:49.458
Mr. Anselmo, there's no need.
Yolanda is waiting for me.

09:49.542 --> 09:52.208
I'm not doing it for you.
You're spilling huge drops of blood.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.292
It's gonna look like the Virgin
came to life.

09:54.375 --> 09:56.667
Take off your jacket.
You're dripping all over.

09:57.208 --> 09:58.250
I'll get you...

09:58.708 --> 10:01.875
some absorbent cotton
and hydrogen peroxide,

10:02.375 --> 10:04.792
and I'll clean up your wound.
Come on, sit down.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.500
Nathalie, what the--

10:08.208 --> 10:09.417
What are you doing here?

10:10.333 --> 10:13.292
Sit here until your dizziness goes away.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.958
I'll show Yolanda the temple myself.

10:16.042 --> 10:17.375
Stay here on your own.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.750
I heard you came to town
and I wanted to see you.

10:21.833 --> 10:23.167
No.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.583
I think we left things pretty clear

10:25.667 --> 10:27.542
before I moved to Valladolid
for my master's.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.125
-Let me take a look.
-No!

10:29.208 --> 10:31.708
-It's going to get infected. Come on.
-No big deal.

10:34.375 --> 10:36.708
Gently.

10:40.333 --> 10:42.417
You didn't miss me, even a little?

10:43.208 --> 10:44.667
No? You didn't?

10:46.542 --> 10:48.375
Did you dress up as a Basque for me?

10:49.375 --> 10:52.125
Come on, you know
that makes me horny as hell.

10:57.542 --> 11:00.458
-Is Gorka okay?
-Yes, it's nothing. He's a whiner.

11:00.542 --> 11:03.042
-I'll go check on him.
-No, wait! Look.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.167
Did I show you this?

11:04.250 --> 11:07.542
Look. This is the tombstone
of Gorka's ancestor,

11:07.625 --> 11:09.000
Martín de Intxausti.

11:09.083 --> 11:11.625
One of the greatest knights
of medieval Tellería.

11:11.708 --> 11:12.542
Touch it.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.083
Limestone.

11:18.792 --> 11:19.833
Wait.

11:21.625 --> 11:22.750
I have to go.

11:22.833 --> 11:24.500
-Me, too.
-Of course.

11:34.792 --> 11:38.958
-Be careful. That floor is rotten.
-Don't worry, Father. I'm a professional.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.542
-That was close.
-You see?

11:47.167 --> 11:48.250
Are you okay?

11:48.917 --> 11:49.750
Yolanda.

11:49.833 --> 11:51.458
Yolanda! Are you okay?

11:55.125 --> 11:56.667
-Are you okay?
-Yes!

11:57.375 --> 11:59.875
Yes, I'm okay.

12:00.833 --> 12:01.833
I think.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.542
What about the <i>lehendakari?</i> We need to go.

12:04.625 --> 12:07.375
-You go. I'll stay and rescue the girl.
-Are you sure?

12:07.458 --> 12:08.583
-Yes.
-All right.

12:08.667 --> 12:10.458
-Call me if you need anything.
-Okay.

12:13.750 --> 12:14.917
-Yolanda!
-Yeah.

12:16.042 --> 12:17.167
Are you down there?

12:19.250 --> 12:20.583
Mr. Anselmo, be careful.

12:21.792 --> 12:23.208
Shit, Mr. Anselmo!

12:25.000 --> 12:26.792
Yolanda. Yolanda, thank God.

12:26.875 --> 12:28.417
-Are you okay? Are you hurt?
-Yes. No, I--

12:28.500 --> 12:30.250
-Your head? Did you hurt your head?
-No, I'm okay.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.792
I'm okay. Now I'm hurt.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.250
Well, I'll be damned.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.958
There's a hidden crypt beneath the church.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.875
And archeologists didn't find it.

12:49.625 --> 12:51.292
Crap! Careful.

12:59.125 --> 13:02.208
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.

13:12.667 --> 13:13.792
Don't!

13:20.708 --> 13:21.917
Hey, over here!

13:22.417 --> 13:25.667
Yolanda, look at this.
It looks like there's an epitaph.

13:26.833 --> 13:28.125
It's in Latin.

13:37.875 --> 13:39.042
Shit, the girl is good.

13:39.583 --> 13:41.500
Yes. But what does that mean, Yolanda?

13:41.583 --> 13:43.417
"Here lays Walterius..."

13:43.917 --> 13:45.500
-Walterius?
-Walter.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.750
"Son of Lord..."

13:49.083 --> 13:51.708
No, "Son of the legendary
Lord of Tellería...

13:54.375 --> 13:55.458
William Tell."

13:56.667 --> 13:58.042
William Tell?

13:58.125 --> 14:00.583
The liberating Swiss hero?
The one with the apple?

14:02.750 --> 14:03.833
Well, I'll be damned.

14:06.458 --> 14:07.750
William Tell.

14:15.333 --> 14:17.333
It looks like there's something in there.

14:17.833 --> 14:20.167
Mr. Anselmo, give me a hand.
Yolanda, give us light.

14:20.542 --> 14:21.625
Help me.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.583
-It won't budge.
-A little bit more.

14:30.458 --> 14:31.458
I got it.

14:33.375 --> 14:35.292
I think I can reach it. Yeah.

14:55.250 --> 14:56.458
-No!
-No!

14:56.542 --> 14:57.958
-No!
-What are you doing?

14:58.042 --> 15:00.792
Gorka, no! If it contains a document,

15:00.875 --> 15:02.833
it could vanish
when coming into contact with air.

15:04.292 --> 15:05.125
You...

15:22.875 --> 15:25.000
Here ends my political career.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.958
The Basque Country
has turned its back on us.

15:29.208 --> 15:31.583
Honey, come on. Let's go home.

15:31.667 --> 15:34.417
I'm gonna make you
a finger-licking good tuna pot.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.792
It'll cheer you up.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.917
This is the end, boys. It is what it is.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.333
-It is what it is.
-Mr. Anselmo, hold on.

15:41.417 --> 15:43.125
Iker! Hey!

15:44.042 --> 15:45.000
What, Gorka?

15:45.292 --> 15:47.333
You picked a bad day
to come back to Tellería.

15:47.417 --> 15:49.875
What's wrong?
I thought today was the big day.

15:49.958 --> 15:50.958
You didn't hear?

15:51.792 --> 15:54.542
-We're not Basque anymore!
-Shit, you can't be serious.

15:54.625 --> 15:56.125
The <i>lehendakari</i> thinks
we're just a marching band.

15:56.208 --> 15:58.208
All this fighting for the Basque Country
has been in vain.

15:58.292 --> 16:00.917
I warned you, but you wouldn't listen.
"Let's ignore the priest."

16:01.000 --> 16:03.625
-Come on, Iker, cheer up.
-This subject's just...

16:03.708 --> 16:05.542
Listen, this is Yolanda.
She's in charge of inventory.

16:05.625 --> 16:07.417
-Hi. What's up?
-Hey, Yolanda. Nothing much.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.250
-Hanging in there.
-We have to go.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.208
-Come on, Iker. Let's go.
-Yes, let's go.

16:11.292 --> 16:14.125
Anyway, Gorka, come by the <i>baserri</i>
one day, and we'll catch up.

16:14.208 --> 16:15.875
You can bring the girl if you want.

16:15.958 --> 16:18.375
-For fuck's sake, let's go.
-Yes!

16:20.625 --> 16:21.833
Come on, Iker, cheer up.

16:21.917 --> 16:23.042
You can do it.

16:23.125 --> 16:24.750
Don Anselmo, champ. What?

16:24.833 --> 16:26.458
What you got there,
the baston for the <i>korrika?</i>

16:27.625 --> 16:28.917
Pothead.

16:29.917 --> 16:31.500
You won't stop speaking.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.875
Look, there's my dad! Dad!

16:34.958 --> 16:36.625
-Mom!
-Sweetheart!

16:36.708 --> 16:39.333
When did you get here?
Son, you're so skinny.

16:39.417 --> 16:41.125
-Hello. How are you?
-Who is this?

16:41.208 --> 16:43.500
This is Yolanda, my partner.
She's in charge of inventory.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.500
What happened to her?
Why is she all dirty?

16:45.833 --> 16:46.958
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.792
I thought you were working
with that Galician from your university.

16:50.875 --> 16:52.708
It is her, Mom. And she's not Galician,
she's from Ponferrada.

16:52.792 --> 16:55.417
That's what I said, Galician.
I don't like her one bit.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.958
If only you would've treated
Nathalie right.

16:57.042 --> 16:59.000
Will you stop pestering me about Nathalie?

16:59.083 --> 17:00.208
She's such a sweet girl.

17:00.292 --> 17:02.042
And she got a job at the town hall.

17:02.125 --> 17:04.417
She's Dad's right hand.
And you quit your job.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.458
And that dull girl?

17:06.125 --> 17:09.083
She's not good enough for you.
You make a terrible couple.

17:09.167 --> 17:10.583
She has a boyfriend.

17:10.667 --> 17:13.000
I told you, she's my partner,
in charge of inventory. Period.

17:13.083 --> 17:13.917
Thanks to your dad.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.625
He kept bugging that guy
from the government of Castile-León.

17:16.708 --> 17:18.208
Mom, that's enough, okay?

17:18.292 --> 17:19.208
That's enough.

17:19.292 --> 17:21.208
-Where is she staying?
-At the Lucerna.

17:21.292 --> 17:23.542
Good, because she's not welcome
in my house.

17:26.208 --> 17:28.625
So, sweetie, you're staying with us, yeah?
No need to waste money.

17:28.708 --> 17:32.125
I know your pay is shit.
Besides, the Lucierna Inn is a hellhole.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.542
-Lucerna.
-Yeah, that.

17:33.625 --> 17:35.500
-I--
-Dad. Dad!

17:35.583 --> 17:37.292
Don't be upset about this.

17:37.375 --> 17:39.000
You know politics bring
only disappointments.

17:39.083 --> 17:41.333
Antolín. Maybe this isn't the right time,

17:41.417 --> 17:43.667
but your son, this young lady and I
have made a discovery.

17:43.750 --> 17:46.417
Yeah. Did you know there's a hidden crypt
in the Sanctuary of the Dull?

17:46.500 --> 17:49.125
And a medieval tomb. We found this.

17:49.208 --> 17:51.042
I don't give three shits about that.

17:52.208 --> 17:53.292
Let's go, Anamari.

17:55.125 --> 17:57.333
-But Dad--
-Leave him be. He's being impossible.

17:57.417 --> 17:59.000
Just like when Athletic loses a game.

17:59.083 --> 18:03.083
Antolín! Antolín, hold on.
You're going to slip!

18:03.750 --> 18:05.375
Will you wait for me?
You're so pig-headed!

18:07.500 --> 18:10.750
-This could change our town's history.
-I know that, Mr. Anselmo. I know.

18:10.833 --> 18:12.042
Tell him... Antolín!

18:12.125 --> 18:13.833
I don't understand that man.

18:13.917 --> 18:17.042
UNIVERSITY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY
ÁLAVA CAMPUS

18:22.792 --> 18:25.125
-What's up, Peio?
-What's up, Gorka?

18:25.208 --> 18:26.875
Hello, good-lookin'.

18:26.958 --> 18:28.333
-Let's go.
-But--

18:30.750 --> 18:34.000
Three years digging in that fucking
sanctuary, and we don't find a thing.

18:34.083 --> 18:35.625
Two suckers show up, and bam!

18:35.708 --> 18:38.958
Right off the bat.
The working class definitely has no luck.

18:39.042 --> 18:40.583
Listen, Burka.

18:40.667 --> 18:44.417
That crazy priest who greeted us
with a Mauser rifle, is he still there?

18:44.917 --> 18:46.208
Mr. Anselmo?

18:46.708 --> 18:49.667
We should continue the excavation,
but who's going to dare go back there?

18:50.375 --> 18:53.833
Listen, Peio. Sorry. Have I mentioned
that Yolanda is a heritage specialist?

18:53.917 --> 18:56.583
I'm a fervent admirer of your work.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.375
Yeah, well, I just got back
from the council office.

18:58.458 --> 18:59.667
I'm always up a gum tree.

18:59.750 --> 19:03.167
Come on, let's go to the lab.
Show me that thing you found.

19:06.667 --> 19:09.417
-All yours.
-My, oh, my.

19:18.708 --> 19:21.208
You take it. Go on.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.458
-Shit. You bastards, you found it!
-What?

19:46.333 --> 19:50.750
What I've been looking for in archives
and excavations for a long time.

19:50.833 --> 19:52.750
This...

19:53.292 --> 19:55.375
could change the history
of the Basque Country,

19:55.458 --> 19:57.875
of Spain, and even Switzerland's!

19:58.375 --> 20:02.917
It mentions Tellstadt as a Swiss canton
far off from the original territory.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.333
Tellstadt?

20:05.292 --> 20:09.917
Tell me, Gorka, what do you prefer,
fried bread or <i>picatostes?</i>

20:11.875 --> 20:15.583
-It's a trick question, isn't it?
-That's right. They're the same thing.

20:16.292 --> 20:20.625
Okay. Tellstadt and Tellería
are exactly the same.

20:20.708 --> 20:23.875
Be it in Basque, German, Swiss or Romansh.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.833
"The city of Tell."

20:26.375 --> 20:31.000
Tell-herria. Tell-hiria.
Tellería. Tellería, God damn it.

20:31.083 --> 20:32.917
All right, slow down, Peio. Slow down.

20:33.417 --> 20:35.667
Are you telling me...
Are you telling us...

20:36.375 --> 20:38.083
that my town, Tellería...

20:39.208 --> 20:41.542
-is of Swiss origin?
-That's right, boy.

20:42.417 --> 20:43.917
It once was a canton

20:44.000 --> 20:47.042
that belonged to the Swiss Confederation
in the 14th century.

20:47.125 --> 20:49.458
But I thought William Tell was a myth.

20:49.542 --> 20:51.500
No. Wrong, young lady.

20:51.583 --> 20:55.750
He did exist. But the one we should really
be interested in is his son, Walter Tell.

20:55.833 --> 20:59.875
He annexed Tellería to Switzerland
as a distant canton.

21:01.167 --> 21:04.500
Apparently, Tell helped
King Henry of Trastámara

21:04.667 --> 21:06.292
fight against Peter the Cruel.

21:06.875 --> 21:08.208
And as payment,

21:08.292 --> 21:11.417
he gave him the town.
Like, "There you go."

21:11.500 --> 21:12.708
So if it hasn't been revoked...

21:12.792 --> 21:15.417
Tellería could... No, should

21:15.500 --> 21:17.292
be Swiss.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.083
I'll have a <i>txakolí,</i> Bernabé.

21:26.583 --> 21:28.583
Wait. Make it a Rueda.

21:28.667 --> 21:31.250
It comes from our sturdy Castilian land.

21:35.042 --> 21:38.250
Come on, Bernabé, it's Thursday.
I want my free <i>pintxo.</i>

21:38.333 --> 21:39.167
Cheers.

21:39.250 --> 21:41.208
God damn it, Revuelta,
quit being a pain in the ass.

21:41.292 --> 21:43.792
You've been annoying everyone all morning.

21:43.875 --> 21:46.250
-Hey there, Bernabé.
-What's up, Antolín?

21:47.083 --> 21:49.958
This is all his fault.
We should banish him.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.292
The Basque Government
has turned its back on us because of you.

21:52.375 --> 21:54.375
You'd better watch your words, Añíbarro.

21:54.833 --> 21:56.875
Antolín has absolute majority
in the city hall

21:56.958 --> 21:58.542
and he's working his ass off for Tellería.

21:58.625 --> 22:01.542
He should work his ass off
to solve the town's problems.

22:01.625 --> 22:04.500
We always get cut off when it snows.
We need a snowplow.

22:04.583 --> 22:08.292
And the kids have to study in Vitoria.
When will you build a high school?

22:08.375 --> 22:09.875
And what's up
with the broadcast translator?

22:09.958 --> 22:12.875
My TV only gets TVE and ETB1.
Shit, I'm Basque,

22:12.958 --> 22:15.750
but that doesn't mean I want to watch
<i>pelota</i> games and oxen pulling all day.

22:15.833 --> 22:17.083
What do you want me to do

22:17.167 --> 22:19.833
if both the Spanish and the Basque
have forsaken us?

22:19.917 --> 22:22.875
You're the mayor.
If you can't solve any problems,

22:22.958 --> 22:24.500
-then get the fuck out!
-Exactly.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.542
Solve our problems,
and stop wasting time on nonsense.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.333
Your dad should know about this, right?

22:31.417 --> 22:34.750
I don't know how I'm gonna tell my mom
that you're staying at the Lucerna.

22:34.833 --> 22:35.833
Don't change the subject.

22:35.917 --> 22:37.958
There's a lot to discuss
about this discovery.

22:38.042 --> 22:41.250
Everyone wants a piece of the cake,
but I'm the one who found it.

22:42.792 --> 22:44.333
All right, we both did.

22:44.667 --> 22:48.000
-But I was the one who fell in the crypt.
-You got lucky!

22:48.083 --> 22:48.958
Yeah, I did!

22:49.042 --> 22:50.917
Did his friend recover from that fall?

22:51.000 --> 22:53.750
Yolanda? Ask her yourself.
You'll see her at dinner.

22:54.667 --> 22:56.042
She seems nice, huh?

22:56.125 --> 22:58.000
And don't worry, she has a boyfriend.

22:58.083 --> 23:00.708
Some Portuguese photographer. A genius.

23:01.667 --> 23:03.917
The only thing that worries me

23:04.000 --> 23:07.333
is that the discovery of this tomb
may be the end of our racket.

23:09.375 --> 23:11.958
Hey. How are you, Gorka? Long time no see.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.250
-How are you?
-Right.

23:13.333 --> 23:15.083
Yeah, definitely.

23:16.375 --> 23:18.042
-Yeah.
-Hi.

23:18.542 --> 23:20.875
Right! Nathalie, Yolanda.
Yolanda, Nathalie.

23:20.958 --> 23:22.958
-How do you do?
-You took quite a spill, huh?

23:23.042 --> 23:24.333
Gosh, does the whole town know?

23:24.417 --> 23:26.125
-Do you feel better?
-Yeah.

23:26.208 --> 23:28.625
Listen, Mr. Anselmo.
You're not going to believe this,

23:28.708 --> 23:31.083
but we went to see Peio Etxeberria,
and he won't come back here.

23:31.167 --> 23:32.500
He's terrified of you.

23:32.583 --> 23:35.250
-Yeah, he says you threatened him.
-Me?

23:36.292 --> 23:37.833
With a Mauser rifle.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.750
I threatened him with a what?

23:40.833 --> 23:42.167
-A Mouser?
-With a Mauser rifle.

23:42.250 --> 23:44.458
I don't know what that is,
a Mounser or whatever.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
No. What that archeologist needs to do

23:47.083 --> 23:49.500
is seal the excavation
so no more people fall in it.

23:53.417 --> 23:56.042
Come on, Anamari's steak
is waiting for us. Let's go!

23:56.125 --> 23:57.875
Here's the steak.

23:57.958 --> 23:59.458
That looks delicious.

23:59.542 --> 24:00.500
Enjoy.

24:01.250 --> 24:02.833
-Will you pass the bread?
-Sure.

24:05.500 --> 24:09.000
Some potatoes.
Make some room for the peppers.

24:09.875 --> 24:11.833
So, Mr. Anselmo,
aren't you going to say grace?

24:11.917 --> 24:14.292
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

24:14.375 --> 24:17.000
Dig in! Meat isn't half as good
when it's cold. Come on.

24:17.500 --> 24:18.500
You want some?

24:18.583 --> 24:20.083
-Just a little.
-Come on.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.000
-That's enough.
-Thanks.

24:25.250 --> 24:26.667
-You don't like steak?
-Me?

24:26.958 --> 24:28.625
No, I just don't eat meat.

24:28.708 --> 24:29.792
I'm a vegan.

24:31.583 --> 24:32.583
Jeez.

24:32.667 --> 24:34.000
-I'll make you a salad.
-No.

24:34.083 --> 24:35.667
There's salad in the kitchen. I'll get it.

24:35.750 --> 24:38.458
-No. Sit down, honey. I'll go.
-No, but--

24:38.542 --> 24:41.250
-It's all right.
-I can eat pepper and potatoes, and...

24:42.750 --> 24:44.042
Do you have quinoa?

24:47.958 --> 24:49.208
Here's the salad.

24:49.292 --> 24:50.708
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

24:51.458 --> 24:52.292
Thank you.

24:54.292 --> 24:56.500
Nathalie, you sure love steak, honey.

24:56.583 --> 24:58.708
I don't know what you do with it,
you look so fit.

24:58.792 --> 25:00.750
Everything is delicious, Anamari.
As always.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.958
I've missed us spending time all together.

25:06.875 --> 25:09.417
-The tomb. We need to talk about the tomb.
-Yeah, honey.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.667
What is it that you've found
in the sanctuary?

25:11.750 --> 25:13.792
The tomb of William Tell's son.

25:13.875 --> 25:15.708
The one who stole from the rich
and gave to the poor?

25:15.792 --> 25:17.875
-That was Robin Hood, Mom.
-Jesus.

25:17.958 --> 25:20.333
William Tell, Robin Hood. Same thing.

25:21.708 --> 25:22.542
Excuse me.

25:22.625 --> 25:26.083
Antolín, lighten up.
That discovery is great for our town.

25:26.542 --> 25:29.375
I'm only interested in finding a solution
to our real problems,

25:29.458 --> 25:30.750
not interested in nonsense.

25:30.833 --> 25:34.417
The snowplow, the high school,
the broadcast translator station.

25:34.500 --> 25:37.958
Dad, listen to me.
The document we found in the crypt says

25:38.042 --> 25:40.792
-that Tellería could be Swiss.
-Just what we needed.

25:40.875 --> 25:42.500
After the Basque let-down?

25:42.583 --> 25:44.750
This is different.
Yolanda, explain it to him.

25:44.833 --> 25:47.667
-It can be--
-Antolín, listen to our boy. He's right.

25:50.250 --> 25:52.583
-We went to see Peio Etxeberria.
-That guy makes me sick.

25:52.667 --> 25:55.250
The paleontologist?
But he's such a nice person.

25:55.333 --> 25:58.792
Mom, he's a paleographer.
A paleographer and archeologist.

25:59.083 --> 26:01.667
He's going to explain everything
tomorrow at the city hall, Antolín.

26:02.750 --> 26:05.500
This is the document.
And it's perfectly legal.

26:05.583 --> 26:08.750
In fact, there is no evidence
of it being revoked to date.

26:08.833 --> 26:13.000
Which means that Tellería is,
for all intents and purposes,

26:13.083 --> 26:14.625
a Swiss canton.

26:14.708 --> 26:15.792
Swiss?

26:16.292 --> 26:18.833
So we can request an annexation
into Switzerland?

26:18.917 --> 26:20.583
-That's right.
-What?

26:20.667 --> 26:22.625
Let's think about this for a minute.

26:22.708 --> 26:25.333
We've been trying to be Basque
all our lives.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.667
Maybe being Swiss is what's best for us.

26:27.750 --> 26:30.167
We're not Swiss, we're Basque, damn it!

26:30.250 --> 26:31.667
Yeah, we're Basque!

26:31.750 --> 26:35.125
Wrong. Not you, Bernabé.
You are not Basque.

26:35.875 --> 26:37.625
You are Helvetian.

26:37.708 --> 26:39.583
A Betis supporter, me?
My team is Athletic till I die!

26:43.500 --> 26:46.583
Here. Your family tree is pretty clear.

26:47.208 --> 26:48.792
Since your father passed away,

26:48.875 --> 26:51.958
you are a direct descendant
of William Tell.

26:52.042 --> 26:53.667
But all my family names are Basque.

26:54.167 --> 26:57.208
-Tellería, Tellegorri, Telletxea.
-Bernabé, hold on.

26:57.875 --> 27:00.875
Being a descendant of William Tell
is not that bad.

27:01.292 --> 27:03.375
-No, not bad at all.
-I'm gonna kill you!

27:04.000 --> 27:06.458
Anyway, I should leave now. I'm...

27:06.542 --> 27:09.875
They're waiting for me in the crypt.
And I have to examine the tomb.

27:09.958 --> 27:12.042
-So...
-Mr. Anselmo, where are you going?

27:12.125 --> 27:16.125
Me? I just wanted to thank
Mr. Peio Etxeberria for his wisdom.

27:17.333 --> 27:19.125
You left my church looking like a mess.

27:19.208 --> 27:22.167
-I will get you, you bastard.
-All right. Bye-bye.

27:28.792 --> 27:34.000
For 700 years, we have been fighting
amongst ourselves.

27:34.083 --> 27:38.000
Some said we're Basque.
Others said we're Castilian.

27:38.667 --> 27:40.708
This document states it clearly.

27:41.250 --> 27:42.667
We are Swiss!

27:43.292 --> 27:45.750
The Basque don't want us.

27:45.833 --> 27:48.208
And we don't want to be Castilian.

27:48.292 --> 27:50.583
So let's compromise. Let's be Swiss.

27:50.667 --> 27:52.917
Swiss? This is unbelievable.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.958
-How on earth could we be Swiss?
-All right.

27:55.042 --> 27:58.542
What would it mean for Tellería
to be a part of Switzerland?

28:00.333 --> 28:01.333
No.

28:02.625 --> 28:07.333
We would be part of one of the most
prosperous countries in the world.

28:10.333 --> 28:11.292
No?

28:13.458 --> 28:17.250
I'll put the technicalities aside.
Two words. Tax haven.

28:19.083 --> 28:21.625
Mr. Anselmo, tell everyone
what you told me.

28:26.875 --> 28:28.208
The Way of Tell.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.708
From Altdorf to Tellería.

28:33.042 --> 28:35.875
The tomb could be a tourist attraction.

28:35.958 --> 28:40.042
A focal point of pilgrimage.
Like the Primitive Way, only better.

28:40.125 --> 28:41.917
God! We'll make a killing!

28:42.000 --> 28:44.833
-Get ready for us, Way of St. James!
-Have you lost your minds?

28:45.125 --> 28:48.125
How are we gonna be part of a country
located at the other end of Europe?

28:48.625 --> 28:49.750
Hang on a second.

28:50.792 --> 28:53.958
-Pay attention to this.
-That's nice.

28:54.292 --> 28:57.917
Here is Tellería. Here is Tenerife.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.833
Fourteen hundred miles away.
And we belong to the same country.

29:01.625 --> 29:05.208
Here is Tellería. Here is Switzerland.

29:05.292 --> 29:08.000
Eight hundred miles away.
That's 600 miles closer.

29:09.417 --> 29:11.958
Who says we can't be Swiss?

29:12.042 --> 29:15.417
He's right. We're closer to Geneva
than we are to Lanzarote, Revuelta.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.875
You don't know jack.
And you did your military service there.

29:19.167 --> 29:22.125
All right. Now that we've solved
the technical issues, let's vote.

29:22.208 --> 29:24.083
-Come on, Bernabé.
-Yes?

29:24.167 --> 29:25.500
The ballot boxes.

29:25.583 --> 29:27.458
-Yes.
-Yes.

29:28.125 --> 29:29.500
-No.
-No.

29:30.292 --> 29:32.250
-Yes.
-Yes.

29:32.333 --> 29:33.750
Antolín's resignation.

29:36.292 --> 29:39.417
This is Añíbarro's handwriting.
Invalid vote.

29:39.500 --> 29:42.208
-Carrying on. Yes.
-Yes.

29:42.500 --> 29:43.333
No.

29:43.417 --> 29:44.292
No.

29:44.417 --> 29:47.583
-I don't give a fuck.
-You... Invalid vote.

29:47.667 --> 29:48.583
-And yes.
-Yes.

29:51.792 --> 29:54.042
The results of the voting are...

29:54.583 --> 29:57.000
Invalid votes, 14.

29:57.083 --> 30:00.583
Abstentions, 86.

30:00.667 --> 30:05.458
Votes for "no" on the annexation, 157.

30:05.542 --> 30:09.667
Votes for "yes," 599.

30:10.958 --> 30:12.875
Well, complying with the people's mandate,

30:12.958 --> 30:15.750
the city hall will begin
the application process

30:15.833 --> 30:17.375
for the annexation to Switzerland.

30:17.458 --> 30:18.958
What are you talking about?

30:19.875 --> 30:21.542
They won't pay any attention to you.

30:21.625 --> 30:23.625
Dad, calm down, okay?
We'll talk about it at home.

30:23.708 --> 30:25.333
I have nothing to say to you.

30:25.958 --> 30:28.042
-Hooray for democracy!
-Great.

30:34.125 --> 30:35.583
BASQUE COUNTRY
TELLSTADT

30:35.667 --> 30:36.583
TELLSTADT, A NEW CANTON?

30:36.667 --> 30:38.917
A tiny Spanish village
wants to become a member

30:39.000 --> 30:40.958
of the Swiss Confederation.

30:41.042 --> 30:45.750
Here is more information
from Hans Moser in Tell Town.

30:46.208 --> 30:50.708
The grave of William Tells son Walter
was discovered in the town's church.

30:50.792 --> 30:54.167
The Swiss government will send
a delegation to Tell Town,

30:54.250 --> 30:58.333
to devise a plan for the potential
integration into the Swiss Confederation.

30:58.417 --> 31:00.458
Will this become the 27th canton?

31:11.667 --> 31:13.458
BERN - SWITZERLAND

31:13.542 --> 31:15.708
FEDERAL PALACE

31:20.917 --> 31:23.833
You're going to take off that hat,
aren't you?

31:29.250 --> 31:31.042
Forgive me, Antolín but...

31:32.333 --> 31:34.167
I've been wearing a <i>txapela</i> all my life,

31:34.750 --> 31:36.375
and I love this hat.

31:37.375 --> 31:38.542
It must be in my genes.

31:43.458 --> 31:44.500
Follow me.

31:50.625 --> 31:53.875
Mrs. President. Pleased to meet you.

31:55.292 --> 31:58.542
As a descendant of the one
and only William Tell,

31:58.625 --> 32:00.542
it is an honor for me to be
in front of the person

32:00.625 --> 32:02.667
who rules the country of my ascentors.

32:02.750 --> 32:03.750
Ancestors.

32:04.250 --> 32:06.208
Will you shut up?
She can't understand you.

32:06.292 --> 32:07.708
And she's not the president.

32:07.792 --> 32:09.875
She's the Deputy
Secretary-General of State.

32:09.958 --> 32:11.167
Take a seat.

32:13.125 --> 32:15.250
The whole matter about Tellería

32:15.333 --> 32:17.750
has generated sympathy
among the Swiss people.

32:18.583 --> 32:20.167
You see? She can understand us.

32:20.250 --> 32:24.875
We are studying the possibility
of bringing the tomb to Altdorf,

32:24.958 --> 32:26.292
but it is too soon.

32:27.042 --> 32:30.458
We have already talked to Yolanda Penedo,
the person who made the discovery.

32:30.542 --> 32:31.583
What?

32:32.500 --> 32:35.542
What we want is to be Swiss.

32:37.917 --> 32:42.500
You must understand,
this entails a process that may take long.

32:43.208 --> 32:45.208
Your people don't speak our languages,

32:45.292 --> 32:47.542
your culture is different from ours,

32:47.625 --> 32:49.833
and you are not in Switzerland.
In other words...

32:50.583 --> 32:51.917
You are not Swiss.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.667
Unimportant details.

32:54.583 --> 32:56.583
Nathalie was born here. Bernabé...

32:58.500 --> 33:03.208
You can see the genes in his face.
He's a Tell from head to toe.

33:03.708 --> 33:06.083
Besides, I know a few words
in Swiss already.

33:06.167 --> 33:10.167
Nestlé, Federer, Rolex, Shaqiri...

33:10.250 --> 33:11.375
Ricola!

33:12.125 --> 33:15.167
You do not look all that ready.

33:15.958 --> 33:18.458
Our people are studying the matter.

33:18.542 --> 33:24.958
In three months, we will go to Tellería
to begin a reflection process to--

33:25.042 --> 33:27.042
Good! In three months, we'll be Swiss.

33:27.125 --> 33:29.833
We will see that in three months.
Make the most of your trip

33:29.917 --> 33:32.417
and get to know our beautiful city.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.875
<i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>

33:47.750 --> 33:49.542
-Did it go well?
-I don't know.

33:50.208 --> 33:52.458
-It went well.
-Good!

33:52.542 --> 33:55.667
-Yolanda, slow down.
-Gorka, calm down.

33:55.750 --> 33:57.083
Dude, I'm driving super slow.

33:57.167 --> 33:59.042
You're driving too fast.
We're not in a hurry.

33:59.125 --> 34:01.708
And we need to wait for Nathalie.
She'll be back from Switzerland soon.

34:01.792 --> 34:03.708
-Nathalie is coming, too?
-Of course.

34:03.792 --> 34:06.125
Iker, Nathalie and I
have been buddies forever.

34:07.583 --> 34:09.958
At the dinner,
it looked like you were a couple.

34:10.667 --> 34:12.667
No.

34:13.333 --> 34:15.375
Well, yeah. I mean, we went out together.

34:15.458 --> 34:17.958
But nothing has happened between us
in a long time.

34:19.333 --> 34:20.625
I didn't mean...

34:21.500 --> 34:23.833
-I mean, it was just a comment. I didn't--
-I know.

34:23.917 --> 34:26.292
-I didn't mean to be nosy.
-I know, don't worry.

34:26.375 --> 34:28.292
It's right there, to the left. There.

34:30.917 --> 34:33.458
-Boy!
-Little guy.

34:33.542 --> 34:34.875
-Hi!
-What's up, Iker?

34:34.958 --> 34:35.833
Casillas!

34:35.917 --> 34:36.917
Easy, lie down.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.833
Sit!

34:39.583 --> 34:42.917
He's totally under my control,
but lately he's being a little naughty.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.542
-I can see that.
-All right. Let's go.

34:44.625 --> 34:45.750
Come in, you two.

34:46.375 --> 34:49.750
-Iker's dog...
-Casillas. He's named Casillas.

34:51.250 --> 34:54.042
<i>Basque Sorrow Number Three.</i>

34:54.917 --> 34:57.083
It shows the consequences
of the Basque conflict

34:57.167 --> 34:58.917
in the consumer society.
I mean, it's obvious.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.417
-It's obvious.
-It's obvious.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.333
And this one... This one's really has a...

35:05.417 --> 35:06.833
bird's soul.

35:07.333 --> 35:08.667
Bird's soul.

35:09.458 --> 35:14.042
It talks about social alienation
and panic in the welfare state.

35:14.125 --> 35:17.667
It's my most commercial work, you know?
I just sold it to Otxandiano's <i>batzoki.</i>

35:17.750 --> 35:18.750
No shit?

35:20.792 --> 35:22.375
God damn it!

35:23.000 --> 35:26.542
The entire house is filled with smoke.
This looks like an Altos Hornos furnace.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.542
Don't piss me off, okay?

35:29.167 --> 35:32.125
And don't make any noise.
I have an early morning.

35:41.125 --> 35:41.958
Excuse me.

35:46.208 --> 35:47.333
Yes, Fer?

35:48.167 --> 35:50.750
Yeah, I know. What's wrong with me?

35:51.250 --> 35:53.958
Do you really want to know?
You called me 20 times.

35:54.042 --> 35:57.417
That's what's wrong with me.
I told you I couldn't talk. I'm working.

35:57.792 --> 35:58.708
No!

35:59.500 --> 36:02.125
Seriously, you've been away
for three months.

36:02.208 --> 36:04.042
For three months. And you never called.

36:04.125 --> 36:06.458
Now I'm the one who's away,
and it's a problem?

36:06.542 --> 36:08.500
What?

36:08.583 --> 36:11.167
-So, you and Yolanda, huh?
-What?

36:11.250 --> 36:13.125
What?

36:13.208 --> 36:16.250
Well... Yeah, right? I mean...

36:16.792 --> 36:18.833
I don't know, man.
I'm totally hung up on her.

36:19.333 --> 36:23.542
You dog. Well, I have my own thing
going on, too. It's...

36:23.625 --> 36:27.292
You know what the problem is, Iker?
I don't know, my head is a mess.

36:28.542 --> 36:32.542
Sometimes, I think... I don't know,
that maybe I have feelings for...

36:33.208 --> 36:36.125
-Shit, Nathalie!
-You're getting high as hell, aren't you?

36:37.625 --> 36:40.208
-Am I too late for dinner?
-Hi. How are you?

36:41.833 --> 36:43.958
-How did things go in Switzerland?
-How did it go in Switzerland?

36:44.042 --> 36:45.625
-Switzerland.
-Good.

36:46.292 --> 36:47.833
You and I have to talk.

36:48.750 --> 36:50.958
Outside. Now.

36:56.833 --> 37:00.458
Come on, help me set everything up.
Let's have dinner outside.

37:00.542 --> 37:04.000
It's a beautiful, beautiful night.

37:04.833 --> 37:07.625
-What's up?
-Nothing. Are you okay?

37:07.708 --> 37:11.292
-Yeah, I'm okay. Just a little cold.
-Do you need a blanket?

37:12.042 --> 37:13.083
That would be great.

37:13.167 --> 37:17.792
Great. Yes, I see you're feeling great
in Tellería after your discovery.

37:17.875 --> 37:18.833
You discoverer.

37:20.667 --> 37:23.000
-I don't follow you.
-I spoke to the Swiss.

37:23.083 --> 37:26.625
And I want everything related to them
to be run by the city hall.

37:28.125 --> 37:29.750
Shut up!

37:30.625 --> 37:32.958
Yeah, but I don't work for you.

37:33.917 --> 37:36.542
The regional government ordered
the inventory. They are my bosses.

37:37.583 --> 37:39.875
And let me remind you that this is Castile

37:40.375 --> 37:41.583
until proven otherwise.

37:41.667 --> 37:44.000
What about Gorka?
Why didn't you tell him anything?

37:44.083 --> 37:46.042
I didn't tell him
because there was no time.

37:46.125 --> 37:47.417
-Right.
-What do you mean, "right"?

37:47.500 --> 37:50.292
-I was going to tell him later.
-I'm going to tell him now, don't worry.

37:50.375 --> 37:51.750
-Gorka!
-What is your problem?

37:51.833 --> 37:53.208
I don't like the way you're talking to me.

37:53.292 --> 37:55.625
Look, honey, this is Tellería.
You'd better follow the rules.

37:55.708 --> 37:57.583
-What rules? You--
-Someone say my name?

37:57.667 --> 37:59.208
-You shut up!
-You shut up!

38:03.208 --> 38:04.542
Shut the hell up!

38:09.125 --> 38:11.000
Citizens of Tellería.

38:11.958 --> 38:15.292
As your mayor,
there is something I'd like to say to you.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.250
And what I want to say...

38:20.542 --> 38:22.875
is that the Swiss want us.

38:22.958 --> 38:24.750
We are their priority!

38:27.375 --> 38:28.625
Excellent.

38:29.625 --> 38:30.875
In three months,

38:31.500 --> 38:35.042
we will adapt to their culture.
It's not that complicated.

38:35.625 --> 38:38.708
We'll just have to make
small changes in our cooking,

38:38.792 --> 38:40.458
adapt to their schedules,

38:40.542 --> 38:44.250
and slowly start speaking
Swiss German correctly.

38:44.333 --> 38:46.292
Unimportant details.

38:46.375 --> 38:50.375
Swiss German? You people have been nagging
about speaking Basque for 30 years

38:50.458 --> 38:51.833
and no one here can speak it.

38:51.917 --> 38:55.500
-Speak for yourself. You're from Laredo.
-I'm from Colindres, you ignorant fool.

38:56.250 --> 38:59.083
Colindres, Laredo, Castro...
They all belong to Santander.

38:59.667 --> 39:00.708
Castro isn't Basque?

39:00.792 --> 39:02.833
Listen. The Swiss want us to adapt

39:02.917 --> 39:06.125
to their legal
and administrative structure so that--

39:06.875 --> 39:08.708
Look, it's Bernabé!

39:08.792 --> 39:10.750
He looks like the jack of clubs!

39:14.542 --> 39:17.750
The alphorn is hard to play,
but you'll get used to it.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.083
Carry on, Antolín.

39:21.833 --> 39:24.125
Citizens of Tellería,

39:24.208 --> 39:27.250
let's join together and make Tellería

39:27.333 --> 39:29.958
the 27th canton!

39:30.500 --> 39:32.417
Bravo! Bravo!

39:34.083 --> 39:36.875
-Long live Switzerland!
-Hurrah!

39:41.667 --> 39:42.708
BASQUE LANGUAGE SCHOOL

39:42.792 --> 39:44.417
SWISS LANGUAGE SCHOOL

39:44.500 --> 39:46.417
<i>Willkommen in Tellstadt.</i>

39:46.500 --> 39:50.083
A small town located in the heart
of the Iberian Peninsula

39:50.167 --> 39:53.583
of Swiss history, culture and sentiment.

39:56.333 --> 40:01.542
Come with me in this incredible journey
through the little Switzerland.

40:03.167 --> 40:06.708
<i>I live in the little Switzerland</i>

40:06.792 --> 40:10.333
<i>In a place called Tellstadt</i>

40:10.417 --> 40:15.375
<i>Postcard-beautiful mountains</i>
<i>And lakes all around</i>

40:17.417 --> 40:20.375
<i>It's where a discovery was made</i>

40:20.833 --> 40:24.417
<i>That's going to change our history</i>

40:24.958 --> 40:29.542
<i>And it brings us closer to William Tell</i>

40:30.875 --> 40:36.333
<i>We want to be</i>
<i>A part of Switzerland now</i>

40:37.708 --> 40:43.542
<i>And then we'll all come together and shout</i>

41:03.542 --> 41:08.083
An idyllic place of peaceful
and cheerful people

41:09.250 --> 41:11.917
<i>who keep their culture alive.</i>

41:20.500 --> 41:23.708
It may be a little Switzerland,

41:23.792 --> 41:26.292
but it has a giant heart!

41:40.583 --> 41:44.125
It looks great. Now just edit out the part
when I fell down and post it online.

41:44.208 --> 41:45.333
But it's already on--

41:46.667 --> 41:47.917
Swiss German.

41:48.458 --> 41:50.958
-Antolín is very good at it.
-He really is.

41:51.042 --> 41:53.875
-And he looks so handsome in that outfit.
-No.

41:54.458 --> 41:56.167
Look how handsome.

41:57.792 --> 41:59.208
Pour me some white wine.

42:06.125 --> 42:08.625
-What is this?
-Noirillon Salvagnin.

42:08.708 --> 42:10.208
From the canton of Vaud.

42:10.958 --> 42:12.250
Just pour me a cup of Rueda.

42:12.625 --> 42:14.458
But we only have Swiss wines.

42:14.542 --> 42:16.292
No free <i>pintxo,</i> either? It's Thursday.

42:16.375 --> 42:17.958
They don't do free <i>pintxos</i> in Switzerland.

42:18.042 --> 42:21.042
-Right. I see they're only for friends.
-They paid for those.

42:32.708 --> 42:35.875
-What the fuck is this shit?
-Noirillon Salvagnin.

42:35.958 --> 42:39.333
-I want a <i>txakolí! </i>Numbnuts.
-We only have Swiss wines.

42:39.875 --> 42:41.375
Damn it all to hell.

42:42.792 --> 42:44.667
Who the fuck closed the <i>pelota</i> court?

42:45.958 --> 42:48.167
You ever hear of people
playing <i>pelota</i> in Switzerland?

42:48.250 --> 42:49.208
Antolín.

42:49.750 --> 42:51.167
This is not Switzerland.

42:51.250 --> 42:53.125
-This is the Basque Country!
-And Castile.

42:53.208 --> 42:56.125
No more Basque rural sports.
Skiing is Switzerland's sport.

42:56.208 --> 42:57.792
Gstaad, St. Moritz, Tellería.

42:57.875 --> 42:59.417
Our town will be crowded with celebrities!

42:59.500 --> 43:02.458
Carolina, Mette-Marit,
Preysler and her playwright.

43:02.542 --> 43:03.750
Maybe I'll be on <i>¡Hola!</i> magazine.

43:03.833 --> 43:06.708
-Come on. Peace.
-We don't eat that shit.

43:06.792 --> 43:09.167
Let's get out of here.
I'm too mad for this.

43:10.542 --> 43:12.125
We'll put an end to this.

43:12.208 --> 43:14.667
Very soon, Antolín. Very soon.

43:17.500 --> 43:20.833
Even if it's only symbolic,
it's good to delineate our borders.

43:20.917 --> 43:22.083
SWITZERLAND
TELLERÍA

43:22.167 --> 43:23.375
Make sure it's straight.

43:23.458 --> 43:24.625
-Look at this.
-Come here.

43:24.708 --> 43:26.083
Come. Come here.

43:26.167 --> 43:29.083
This way. All this way up until here.
What do you think?

43:29.167 --> 43:30.208
What is this, Bernabé?

43:30.292 --> 43:33.750
Yeah, I know he's missing the spear.
But don't worry, it'll be here tomorrow.

43:34.625 --> 43:35.667
I'm amazed.

43:35.750 --> 43:37.625
We've been independent for one day

43:37.708 --> 43:40.333
and you've already managed to get
a pastoral visit from the Pope.

43:41.208 --> 43:42.292
You rock.

43:47.417 --> 43:49.875
Let's walk, come on. March.

43:49.958 --> 43:51.292
Yes, this is it.

43:52.792 --> 43:53.792
Excuse me?

43:55.375 --> 43:57.458
This is not Switzerland.

43:58.750 --> 44:01.417
We do not have a special taxation system.

44:02.667 --> 44:03.750
How should I know?

44:04.125 --> 44:06.292
Call back when Tellería is independent.

44:07.542 --> 44:08.750
Which I doubt will happen!

44:09.333 --> 44:10.875
Yeah, all right. Goodbye.

44:11.542 --> 44:14.042
-I'd like to update my bank book.
-Can you believe this, Mr. Anselmo?

44:14.125 --> 44:17.292
That's the fifth guy that wants
to deposit his undeclared money here.

44:17.875 --> 44:20.542
Even Cristiano Romario's lawyer called.
Can you believe it?

44:20.625 --> 44:23.667
Update my bank book and don't bother me
with nonsense, Añíbarro.

44:24.792 --> 44:26.667
I'll update it right away, Mr. Anselmo.

44:29.958 --> 44:31.417
Tellería will never be Swiss.

44:32.708 --> 44:34.333
LUCERNA INN

44:38.500 --> 44:40.125
The Swiss offered me a contract.

44:40.708 --> 44:42.417
And I'm considering staying.

44:44.458 --> 44:45.292
You're staying?

44:45.875 --> 44:48.542
We can both stay,
if you don't mind working for them.

44:48.625 --> 44:50.208
In fact, I told Peio about it,

44:50.333 --> 44:52.667
and he thinks
it's a really good opportunity for us.

44:52.750 --> 44:55.958
But what about the rest of the inventory?
We still need to go to Frías.

44:56.333 --> 44:57.792
Okay.

44:57.875 --> 44:59.833
Would you rather be bored to death
in Frías,

44:59.917 --> 45:04.542
or conduct a research that will bring us
fame, reputation, money--

45:04.625 --> 45:06.417
Yes, Yolanda, all of that sounds great.

45:06.500 --> 45:08.542
And when we're done with the research,

45:08.625 --> 45:10.083
we can go to Switzerland
and take the tomb with us.

45:11.042 --> 45:14.375
No, not with the tomb.

45:15.208 --> 45:17.125
Think about it.
What about the Way of Tell?

45:17.208 --> 45:20.250
Mr. Anselmo would be very upset.
And my dad. And everyone. No.

45:20.333 --> 45:23.625
Gorka, the whole annexation thing...

45:24.875 --> 45:27.083
The Swiss don't give a crap about it.

45:27.167 --> 45:30.500
-They just want the tomb.
-And you're going to help them?

45:31.083 --> 45:33.417
Are you listening to yourself?
How can you be so selfish?

45:33.500 --> 45:34.542
-Selfish?
-Yeah!

45:34.625 --> 45:36.083
How can you be such a sucker?

45:36.167 --> 45:39.250
This annexation thing
isn't going anywhere.

45:39.333 --> 45:42.583
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you,
but the Swiss don't care about you.

45:42.667 --> 45:44.125
Look, Yolanda...

45:44.833 --> 45:47.208
It's great that you want to pursue
your dreams,

45:47.292 --> 45:49.292
your ambitions and your career.

45:50.417 --> 45:51.958
That's what I like most about you.

45:52.833 --> 45:55.125
Just don't do it at the expense
of others, okay?

45:55.500 --> 45:56.958
Especially at the expense of my people.

46:15.083 --> 46:15.958
<i>Arratsalde on.</i>

46:16.042 --> 46:17.208
Good afternoon.

46:17.292 --> 46:19.833
<i>-Arratsalde on,</i> God damn it!
-Good fucking afternoon!

46:23.750 --> 46:26.125
I don't like you, and you don't like me.

46:27.750 --> 46:29.375
But there are things we dislike even more.

46:29.458 --> 46:31.500
Tellería annexing to Switzerland.

46:31.583 --> 46:32.708
That would be one.

46:44.625 --> 46:47.750
I don't get why they insist
on making this town a part of Switzerland.

46:48.042 --> 46:49.792
We have nothing in common.

47:03.417 --> 47:06.792
SPAIN AND SWITZERLAND
CAN'T REACH AN AGREEMENT ON TELLERÍA

47:26.625 --> 47:28.417
Yeah, all right. I'll hold.

47:29.833 --> 47:32.833
NEW PRIORITY MISSION:
OPERATION TELLERÍA

48:04.542 --> 48:05.375
Hello?

48:06.625 --> 48:07.958
It's the radio people.

48:09.458 --> 48:10.542
Sure, I'll put you through.

48:12.792 --> 48:14.583
Democracy will not be beaten.

48:16.083 --> 48:16.917
Hello?

48:17.833 --> 48:18.667
Well...

48:19.250 --> 48:21.083
Democracy will not be beaten.

48:21.750 --> 48:24.917
In Switzerland, there is no place
for violent people.

48:26.125 --> 48:28.250
No, that's all. No further comments.

48:28.542 --> 48:29.458
Thank you.

48:42.250 --> 48:43.625
"Flagen. Flagen."

48:54.250 --> 48:57.125
Forty-five minute late.

49:08.583 --> 49:13.417
Note. The situation in Tellería
is far worse than we expected.

49:14.792 --> 49:16.208
Terrorist attacks,

49:16.292 --> 49:19.417
language immersion,
the Basque issue all over again...

49:20.000 --> 49:22.083
Shit, this is a powder keg.

49:23.458 --> 49:24.875
THIS IS NOT SPAIN

49:24.958 --> 49:26.708
OF COURSE NOT, DUMBASS, IT'S A WALL

49:26.792 --> 49:28.500
YEAH, BUT IT'S A SWISS WALL

49:32.417 --> 49:36.333
<i>Hi. I'm Yolanda Penedo, art historian.</i>
<i>Leave your message...</i>

49:46.167 --> 49:47.292
Hey, there.

49:47.375 --> 49:49.333
Where are you going?
You can't come in. No visits today.

49:49.417 --> 49:52.042
Hi. I'm a photographer
from National Geographic.

49:53.792 --> 49:57.500
I've come a long way
to do an article on the tomb.

49:57.583 --> 50:00.208
I don't care if you're from <i>Interviú.</i>
Come back next week if you want.

50:00.583 --> 50:02.583
-All right, thank you.
-Bye.

50:04.625 --> 50:07.417
So, how's the couple doing?

50:07.500 --> 50:08.750
We are not a couple.

50:10.667 --> 50:11.625
Hello.

50:12.625 --> 50:15.292
One Merovingian goblet. Move the tablet.

50:16.000 --> 50:16.833
Yes.

50:17.917 --> 50:21.667
-One Visigoth bell with no clapper.
-Gorka--

50:21.750 --> 50:23.833
Gorka, working like this is a pain.

50:23.917 --> 50:26.375
Seriously, do you want us to be mad
at each other?

50:27.458 --> 50:29.708
One reliquary casket.

50:35.833 --> 50:37.000
What kind of equipment?

50:38.042 --> 50:39.125
Precision rifles?

50:40.208 --> 50:42.417
I may still have a couple.
I'd need to check.

50:43.792 --> 50:45.375
Have the advance payment ready.

50:46.000 --> 50:46.833
Bye.

50:47.792 --> 50:51.333
-And one golden cross--
-And that's all! Enough!

50:51.417 --> 50:54.792
What I meant to say yesterday was
let's go to Switzerland together.

50:54.875 --> 50:59.292
To Switzerland, to Cochinchina,
Montenegro, South Sudan, I don't care.

50:59.375 --> 51:00.208
I just--

51:01.625 --> 51:04.625
I just want to be with you.

51:08.208 --> 51:09.375
There, I said it.

51:45.417 --> 51:46.333
I'll be right back.

52:10.292 --> 52:14.042
Yolanda, I've been waiting for you
to say that all this time.

52:14.125 --> 52:15.292
It's perfect!

52:15.833 --> 52:18.458
You, me...

52:20.042 --> 52:22.292
Walter Tell's putrefied corpse...

52:46.083 --> 52:48.083
-Fernando?
-Yolanda?

52:49.083 --> 52:50.458
Oh, come on!

52:51.042 --> 52:52.750
How did this happen, Fer?

52:52.833 --> 52:54.375
Did you get your fingers
caught in something?

52:54.458 --> 52:56.417
I thought I told you not to come in.

52:56.500 --> 52:59.500
-I was looking for Yolanda, my girlfriend.
-You said you wanted to take photos.

53:00.417 --> 53:02.542
The magazine sent me here
to do an article,

53:02.625 --> 53:04.417
and Yolanda turned out to be here as well.

53:04.500 --> 53:05.917
-Oh, really?
-No!

53:06.000 --> 53:08.750
No, seriously. We haven't seen each other
for four months, and you show up now?

53:08.833 --> 53:11.042
Yeah! What are you doing here?

53:11.125 --> 53:12.250
You stay out of it.

53:12.708 --> 53:15.000
Hey, you're Koldo! From her master's.

53:15.083 --> 53:15.958
Gorka.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.833
That's great! You're working with Koldo?

53:18.917 --> 53:20.375
-Gorka!
-Gorka!

53:26.458 --> 53:28.750
Seriously. When you're told
you can't come in,

53:28.833 --> 53:31.500
you can't come in.
That sign is pretty clear.

53:32.167 --> 53:33.292
I don't get people.

53:42.042 --> 53:43.167
No, leave me alone.

53:43.250 --> 53:45.292
-What's wrong with you?
-We'll talk later.

53:45.875 --> 53:48.750
-Who is that with Yolanda?
-It's her boyfriend.

53:49.375 --> 53:52.625
A travel photographer.
A weird guy. Lusitanian.

53:52.708 --> 53:55.458
You've got to be kidding. Fucking Fernando
showing up just now. Awesome.

53:55.542 --> 53:56.792
-Bye.
-Bye.

53:56.875 --> 53:59.042
-What's up with him?
-I don't know.

54:05.167 --> 54:06.708
Sign here, please.

54:07.417 --> 54:08.833
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

54:08.917 --> 54:10.542
You're working late.

54:10.625 --> 54:11.708
We're done now.

54:13.083 --> 54:14.833
Baby, what would you like for dinner?

54:14.917 --> 54:18.333
-Should I make you a bonito omelette?
-No, I had a few snacks.

54:18.417 --> 54:22.208
I left Iker and Añíbarro alone.
The opposition, face to face.

54:23.333 --> 54:25.625
You know what?
I'm going to bed. I'm worn out.

54:25.708 --> 54:28.458
And I think while I was in the sanctuary

54:28.958 --> 54:30.708
I may have pulled a muscle on my back.

54:30.792 --> 54:33.500
-Let me see.
-No, it's okay, Nathalie. No need.

54:34.833 --> 54:37.375
Antolín. Let's go to bed.

54:38.167 --> 54:40.417
Hang on, they're showing
all the goals from Division 2.

54:40.500 --> 54:43.250
You can watch that upstairs
on your tablet.

54:43.333 --> 54:45.167
-It'll just take a second.
-No, it won't.

54:45.250 --> 54:48.125
The other night I waited an hour for you.
I was bored to death.

54:48.208 --> 54:50.208
Come on. Go to bed.

54:50.292 --> 54:51.792
-Good night.
-Good night.

54:51.875 --> 54:53.667
-Right here?
-Right there, yes.

54:53.750 --> 54:56.417
Can you feel it?
Right there, it's a huge muscle knot.

54:57.833 --> 55:01.542
-The sanctuary is keeping you busy, right?
-Yeah, the whole Walter thing--

55:01.625 --> 55:05.375
-Is your friend still mad?
-Yeah. She'll get over it. I think.

55:05.458 --> 55:08.083
Be careful. Don't let her
leave you out of the Swiss thing.

55:08.167 --> 55:10.083
No!

55:11.083 --> 55:14.750
No, I was very clear with her.
We made this discovery together.

55:14.833 --> 55:15.708
Right.

55:22.750 --> 55:25.417
What's going to happen between us,
now that you're staying longer?

55:28.000 --> 55:31.958
What do you mean, "between us"? You and I?

55:35.000 --> 55:36.458
-No.
-No?

55:36.542 --> 55:37.458
No.

55:56.042 --> 55:57.042
What are you doing?

55:58.333 --> 56:00.542
I'm not leaving until my work is finished.

56:01.583 --> 56:03.583
Things are going to get very ugly here.

56:03.667 --> 56:06.292
You're gonna have to listen to me.
Your work is secondary.

56:06.375 --> 56:07.375
Excuse me?

56:07.458 --> 56:08.750
Secondary?

56:08.958 --> 56:11.500
Fer, this is the opportunity of my life!

56:11.667 --> 56:15.167
-My future depends on Tellería.
-Well, you have to trust me.

56:15.750 --> 56:18.500
How am I gonna trust you?

56:18.583 --> 56:21.500
I haven't heard from you in months!

56:21.583 --> 56:24.292
Dude, this has been going on
for a long time.

56:24.375 --> 56:25.875
I'm tired of you.

56:25.958 --> 56:29.125
Believe me when I say
things are going to get ugly in this town.

56:29.792 --> 56:32.167
Things will get ugly
if you don't tell me right now

56:32.250 --> 56:34.000
where you've been for the last months.

56:34.083 --> 56:35.583
I already told you, I was in Namibia!

56:35.667 --> 56:38.250
Taking photographs
of the Kalahari bushmen.

56:38.333 --> 56:40.208
What, there was no signal in Namibia?

56:40.292 --> 56:42.458
You couldn't drop me
an email from Namibia?

56:42.542 --> 56:44.667
Phone signal in Namibia, with the bushmen?

56:45.292 --> 56:47.917
-Come on, are you kidding?
-What are you, a secret agent?

56:50.292 --> 56:51.875
You're shitting me.

56:52.708 --> 56:55.250
You're telling me that you work
for the CNI?

56:55.333 --> 56:57.458
We can't talk about that, okay?

56:59.000 --> 57:00.125
Unbelievable.

57:00.667 --> 57:03.375
Turns out I've been going out
with Mort & Phil

57:03.458 --> 57:05.708
and I find out this late in the movie.

57:07.250 --> 57:08.583
Unbelievable.

57:08.667 --> 57:09.750
Come on, baby.

57:10.875 --> 57:13.500
You know you're the reason
I'm in Tellería.

57:18.292 --> 57:20.167
You know how much I love you.

57:22.375 --> 57:24.875
Should we spend the night here
and leave tomorrow?

57:27.500 --> 57:30.250
No, I'm not going anywhere.

57:30.417 --> 57:31.417
-You're not?
-No.

57:32.083 --> 57:33.458
What if I told you that the priest

57:33.542 --> 57:36.542
has a chest full of guns and explosives
in his sacristy? What then?

57:37.500 --> 57:38.958
-Mr. Anselmo?
-That's right.

57:40.125 --> 57:41.125
Yeah, right.

57:41.917 --> 57:45.083
I hope you have a good reason
for making me get out of bed this early.

57:45.167 --> 57:46.583
I do have a good reason.

57:48.375 --> 57:49.875
I was told

57:49.958 --> 57:53.667
you're hiding a stash of guns
and explosives in here.

57:53.750 --> 57:56.583
-Let me guess who told you.
-That is irrelevant.

57:57.500 --> 57:59.208
You either tell me what's going on,

57:59.292 --> 58:01.292
or I tell everyone
and put an end to your scheme!

58:01.375 --> 58:03.792
Listen, my child. Do not raise your voice
at me in the house of the Lord.

58:03.875 --> 58:05.500
And don't assume the worst.

58:05.583 --> 58:08.208
This is not what it looks like,
and there's an explanation.

58:09.167 --> 58:11.250
<i>I was walking in the forest</i>
<i>a few months ago,</i>

58:11.333 --> 58:13.667
<i>looking for mushrooms</i>
<i>to make myself some scrambled eggs.</i>

58:13.750 --> 58:17.375
<i>Because I love chanterelles</i>
<i>with some garlic, chili pepper,</i>

58:17.458 --> 58:20.583
<i>-with a good organic egg...</i>
<i>-Get to the point, Father.</i>

58:20.833 --> 58:23.708
<i>I was about to collect a </i>perretxiko
<i>when I saw something.</i>

58:51.583 --> 58:53.542
<i>You found an ETA cache?</i>

58:53.625 --> 58:57.208
Intact. Unsoiled. Pristine.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.042
So I had two options.
Either go to the police,

59:01.125 --> 59:02.583
-or try to sell the guns.
-What?

59:02.667 --> 59:04.875
-To the Chechens, or the Arabs.
-What?

59:05.333 --> 59:08.167
But that's not all. I'm leaving the cache,

59:08.250 --> 59:09.750
and guess who I run into.

59:09.833 --> 59:11.792
-Who?
-Nathalie.

59:11.875 --> 59:13.042
Yeah, what a surprise.

59:13.125 --> 59:15.500
She followed me. She wanted to know
where I get my mushrooms.

59:15.583 --> 59:16.792
No one knows about that place.

59:16.875 --> 59:18.750
Because, let me tell you,
I'm a mushroom enthusiast.

59:18.833 --> 59:20.917
-I may be a priest, but I--
-Okay, Father.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.792
You're beating around the bush.
Continue, please.

59:22.875 --> 59:25.250
Try to understand.
Look at what they've done to my church.

59:25.333 --> 59:28.542
Twenty kilos of ammonal would cover
the window panes to seal the excavation.

59:28.625 --> 59:30.792
<i>Otherwise, who's going to pay</i>
<i>for this mess?</i>

59:37.708 --> 59:39.417
-Thank you
-Welcome.

59:40.083 --> 59:41.792
<i>I had to come to an agreement</i>
<i>with Nathalie.</i>

59:41.875 --> 59:44.875
<i>Half for the city hall,</i>
<i>half for the church.</i>

59:48.500 --> 59:50.000
Does Gorka know?

59:50.083 --> 59:51.083
Gorka?

59:51.792 --> 59:54.792
Nathalie might have told him,
now that they're back together.

59:56.500 --> 59:57.708
They're together?

59:59.208 --> 1:00:00.167
Yes.

1:00:02.667 --> 1:00:03.625
All right.

1:00:04.208 --> 1:00:06.125
-I have to... I'm leaving.
-Sure.

1:00:07.917 --> 1:00:09.375
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:00:24.833 --> 1:00:28.917
-Why are you with Añíbarro?
-Well, if it isn't the couple of the hour.

1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:30.458
You finally got what you wanted.

1:00:30.542 --> 1:00:32.750
So, involved in capital flight, are we,
Añíbarro?

1:00:32.833 --> 1:00:35.667
Shouldn't it be the other way around,
now that we're going to be Swiss?

1:00:35.750 --> 1:00:39.125
Go to hell, Intxausti.
You're even dumber than your dad.

1:00:39.208 --> 1:00:42.417
You're both being hornswoggled by her
and you don't even know about it.

1:00:43.250 --> 1:00:44.250
This fool.

1:00:45.750 --> 1:00:48.375
-You've lost your minds with all this.
-Yeah.

1:00:53.042 --> 1:00:54.042
Bye, Nathalie.

1:00:58.250 --> 1:01:00.208
-Where are you going?
-Inside.

1:01:01.917 --> 1:01:03.667
-No.
-No?

1:01:05.750 --> 1:01:07.167
Look, Nathalie...

1:01:07.875 --> 1:01:09.958
I don't know what's going to happen
from this point on.

1:01:10.042 --> 1:01:11.917
Is it because of what Añíbarro said?

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:15.542
No. I don't give a shit
what Añíbarro says.

1:01:17.708 --> 1:01:21.750
Nathalie, you know I've always liked you.
And I love you a bunch.

1:01:23.417 --> 1:01:25.667
-But...
-You like Yolanda.

1:01:26.625 --> 1:01:28.292
You're in love with her, aren't you?

1:01:33.625 --> 1:01:34.458
Yes.

1:01:46.667 --> 1:01:48.208
Shit! You scared me!

1:01:49.208 --> 1:01:50.542
What the hell is this?

1:01:51.083 --> 1:01:53.250
What are you two doing together?
You can't stand each other.

1:01:54.833 --> 1:01:59.667
So you want to blow up
William Tell Junior's tomb.

1:02:01.042 --> 1:02:04.458
-Are you nuts?
-All the Swiss care about is the tomb.

1:02:04.542 --> 1:02:05.625
They don't give a damn
about anything else.

1:02:05.708 --> 1:02:07.708
Without the mausoleum
of William Tell's son,

1:02:07.792 --> 1:02:10.000
what does our town have
that could interest them?

1:02:10.083 --> 1:02:12.208
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

1:02:12.292 --> 1:02:16.042
No. I'm chilling now
and I don't want any trouble. I...

1:02:16.542 --> 1:02:18.750
Besides, why the hell
don't you do it yourselves?

1:02:18.833 --> 1:02:21.083
No, right now I'm...

1:02:21.167 --> 1:02:23.792
super focused on my work and going through
an awesome creative phase.

1:02:23.875 --> 1:02:25.917
I just can't. I...

1:02:28.500 --> 1:02:29.667
How about now?

1:02:29.750 --> 1:02:32.542
I was going to sell that
to the community center in Apamonasterio!

1:02:32.625 --> 1:02:34.208
To hell with that sculpture.

1:02:34.292 --> 1:02:36.125
Now you'll have to focus
on the fight for Euskadi.

1:02:36.208 --> 1:02:38.583
-And for Spain. Don't forget.
-All right.

1:02:38.667 --> 1:02:41.458
-No, I can't do this to Nathalie.
-Do what?

1:02:41.542 --> 1:02:43.750
Betray her now that we're going out.

1:02:43.833 --> 1:02:45.667
We're going to be family, Revuelta!

1:02:46.917 --> 1:02:48.458
Forget about my daughter.
She's with Gorka.

1:02:50.250 --> 1:02:54.375
But she can't be going out with Gorka.
Gorka is going out with Yolanda.

1:02:54.458 --> 1:02:56.833
Well, Anamari is telling everyone
that they're back together.

1:02:56.917 --> 1:02:59.417
And that they hooked up
the other night at his place, right?

1:03:01.208 --> 1:03:02.208
They hooked up?

1:03:16.208 --> 1:03:17.875
There, now it looks better.

1:03:17.958 --> 1:03:20.375
All right. I'm in.

1:03:21.292 --> 1:03:23.375
-Antolín.
-Hold on.

1:03:25.708 --> 1:03:27.708
I'm not even gonna ask. Mr. Mayor.

1:03:27.792 --> 1:03:29.542
That's Canton President.

1:03:29.625 --> 1:03:30.750
Stay still.

1:03:30.833 --> 1:03:32.667
I talked to Heidi.
They're bringing everything forward.

1:03:32.750 --> 1:03:35.750
The Swiss will be here in one week
to legalize the procedure.

1:03:37.042 --> 1:03:39.250
-One week?
-But that's not what we talked about.

1:03:39.333 --> 1:03:41.875
The Spanish government
refuses to negotiate.

1:03:41.958 --> 1:03:43.792
They are sure about this
and want to come right away.

1:03:43.875 --> 1:03:45.625
-Shit!
-Right away?

1:03:45.708 --> 1:03:50.917
What do you mean, "right away"?
But my Swiss German is still very sloppy.

1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.792
We should have picked Romansh.
Nobody can speak that.

1:03:53.875 --> 1:03:56.083
-God!
-Tell me, Nathalie...

1:03:57.458 --> 1:03:59.000
Be honest, okay?

1:03:59.083 --> 1:04:01.125
Do you think we are ready?

1:04:02.875 --> 1:04:05.750
There are a few issues
we need to solve first.

1:04:07.292 --> 1:04:09.667
Añíbarro refuses to accept
suspicious funds in the bank.

1:04:09.750 --> 1:04:10.583
Shit!

1:04:10.917 --> 1:04:13.083
My father wants to move the inn
to Miranda.

1:04:13.167 --> 1:04:16.042
Flight of companies. They're trying
to economically strangle us.

1:04:16.125 --> 1:04:18.000
-All right, that's enough. Enough. No!
-It's just...

1:04:18.083 --> 1:04:21.167
-Let's focus. Okay?
-Shit!

1:04:22.417 --> 1:04:26.000
First off, we're going to set up
a nice welcoming committee for them.

1:04:48.583 --> 1:04:49.458
What are you doing?

1:04:50.917 --> 1:04:52.917
Hey, stop that! Stop! What are you--

1:04:54.125 --> 1:04:56.542
-Holy shit!
-Are you crazy?

1:05:09.708 --> 1:05:10.958
You can't go through.

1:05:11.500 --> 1:05:13.208
What do you mean we can't go through?

1:05:13.292 --> 1:05:15.042
I need to talk to Nathalie.

1:05:15.125 --> 1:05:17.583
She's my niece. Tell her Pascual is here.

1:05:18.083 --> 1:05:19.417
Pascual Revuelta.

1:05:20.250 --> 1:05:21.083
Go.

1:05:33.625 --> 1:05:36.458
-Hey, Iker. What is it?
-Hi, Anamari. Is Gorka home?

1:05:36.542 --> 1:05:38.625
Yes, he's inside, watching <i>Saber y ganar.</i>

1:05:39.167 --> 1:05:40.375
-Come in.
-Thank you.

1:05:40.458 --> 1:05:42.083
-I'll be upstairs, okay?
-All right.

1:05:42.167 --> 1:05:44.583
<i>-Automatization.</i>
-I can't believe it.

1:05:45.292 --> 1:05:48.583
Hey, Iker! Epic. They just showed
the <i>Saber y ganar</i> rap again.

1:05:48.667 --> 1:05:49.875
-No!
-Yeah!

1:05:49.958 --> 1:05:52.583
<i>-Knowing and winning</i>
<i>-Knowing and winning...</i>

1:05:53.500 --> 1:05:55.750
It's so good. You bastard.

1:05:57.833 --> 1:06:00.583
Shit! Iker, what the fuck, man?

1:06:00.750 --> 1:06:03.458
Why don't you ask Nathalie? Fart face.

1:06:05.333 --> 1:06:06.250
What?

1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:14.708
Uncle Pascual, it's enough
that I have to argue with my dad,

1:06:14.792 --> 1:06:16.625
I don't want to argue with you.

1:06:16.708 --> 1:06:18.167
You're not even going
to give me a kiss, Nathaly?

1:06:18.250 --> 1:06:20.542
My name is not Nathaly, I'm Nathalie.
And no, I won't.

1:06:20.625 --> 1:06:22.292
All right, Nathalie.
I don't want any trouble, okay?

1:06:22.375 --> 1:06:24.417
Your dad moved to Switzerland
because he damn pleased.

1:06:24.500 --> 1:06:26.417
Besides, I'm here on duty.

1:06:26.500 --> 1:06:29.125
I'm going to make sure
Tellería doesn't turn into a powder keg.

1:06:29.208 --> 1:06:30.625
Tellería is going to become
part of Switzerland.

1:06:30.708 --> 1:06:31.958
-Switzerland? Damn--
-Yeah.

1:06:32.042 --> 1:06:34.208
Great, just what we needed now.

1:06:34.292 --> 1:06:36.833
-Did you call them?
-Why would I call these guys?

1:06:36.917 --> 1:06:37.958
-Hey.
-What's up?

1:06:38.042 --> 1:06:41.250
The <i>lehendakari</i> sent us
to impose order in this ruckus.

1:06:41.333 --> 1:06:42.625
Who here is Nathalie?

1:06:42.708 --> 1:06:44.083
It's obvious I'm not Nathalie.

1:06:44.167 --> 1:06:45.583
Shit, you're Pascual. How are you, man?

1:06:45.667 --> 1:06:48.333
-Shit, Gorrotxategi. How are you?
-Same old. Good.

1:06:48.417 --> 1:06:50.583
-Yeah. A lot of work lately, huh?
-I'll say.

1:06:50.667 --> 1:06:52.292
We need to fix this soon, or...

1:06:52.375 --> 1:06:53.625
Nathaly! Nathalie!

1:06:54.542 --> 1:06:57.042
Come on, don't tell me
you believe what the priest said.

1:06:57.125 --> 1:06:59.583
I don't know who to believe anymore.

1:06:59.667 --> 1:07:02.250
-Who else would you believe? Me!
-You?

1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.625
-Yeah, right!
-Yola.

1:07:06.708 --> 1:07:08.917
You didn't know Iker was going out
with Nathalie before you came back?

1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:10.833
How should I have known that, Mom?

1:07:10.917 --> 1:07:13.167
I'm always the last to find out
about everything in this town.

1:07:13.250 --> 1:07:14.792
Yolanda! Yolanda, hold on, please!

1:07:14.875 --> 1:07:16.000
-Yolanda.
-Great, and now you.

1:07:16.083 --> 1:07:18.500
What happened to you? No, don't tell me.

1:07:18.583 --> 1:07:21.042
-Nathalie slapped you in the face?
-Will everyone stop mentioning Nathalie?

1:07:21.125 --> 1:07:23.292
I'm not going out with Nathalie.
I've moved on.

1:07:23.375 --> 1:07:25.917
It didn't look like you had moved on
when you slept together the other night.

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:27.542
Get your head straight, son.

1:07:27.625 --> 1:07:28.917
Is there a problem?

1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:30.125
Who is this?

1:07:30.208 --> 1:07:34.125
Let's get out of this fucking crazy town.
This place is not for us. Come on.

1:07:34.208 --> 1:07:36.083
Who are you calling crazy, fart face?

1:07:40.417 --> 1:07:41.875
You and your damn mom.

1:07:41.958 --> 1:07:43.292
My baby is not crazy!

1:07:43.375 --> 1:07:44.333
Mom, no!

1:07:44.417 --> 1:07:45.750
No. Stop!

1:07:45.833 --> 1:07:48.792
Mom, please, stop!
That's enough. Enough, Mom!

1:07:48.875 --> 1:07:50.708
Stop it!

1:07:53.333 --> 1:07:54.375
Let's go, Fer.

1:08:08.292 --> 1:08:09.833
Fifty, as usual?

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:12.250
No. Today I need...

1:08:13.250 --> 1:08:14.375
something else.

1:08:14.875 --> 1:08:16.792
Speed, coke, meth, special K, happy pills,

1:08:16.875 --> 1:08:19.292
-heroin--
-Let's take it slow.

1:08:19.375 --> 1:08:20.458
Marijuana?

1:08:21.708 --> 1:08:22.958
Later, maybe...

1:08:23.583 --> 1:08:26.667
But no. This is about something else.

1:08:33.083 --> 1:08:34.375
Talk to the boss about that.

1:08:46.042 --> 1:08:47.917
You can't have that in here!
What are you, stupid?

1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:49.167
Relax, uncle.

1:08:49.250 --> 1:08:50.792
The detonator's under control.

1:08:51.375 --> 1:08:53.083
Iker!

1:08:56.333 --> 1:08:57.958
Damn your skull, Iker.

1:08:58.708 --> 1:09:00.167
Do not play with that.

1:09:04.083 --> 1:09:06.458
So, a cup of coffee?

1:09:06.542 --> 1:09:08.125
DEAR YOLANDA,
YOUR POST-DOCTORAL SCHOLARSHIP REQUEST

1:09:08.208 --> 1:09:09.667
FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORENCE
HAS BEEN APPROVED.

1:09:09.750 --> 1:09:11.000
We should spend the night in Vitoria.

1:09:11.083 --> 1:09:14.375
Things here are too weird. I don't know
how you put up with these people.

1:09:14.458 --> 1:09:15.500
Fer!

1:09:18.958 --> 1:09:21.042
I got it! The scholarship!

1:09:21.125 --> 1:09:24.125
-The post-doctoral in Florence!
-That's great, my love!

1:09:24.208 --> 1:09:26.792
You're not just beautiful,
you're just as smart.

1:09:26.875 --> 1:09:28.042
Yeah!

1:09:28.125 --> 1:09:29.500
But what am I gonna do?

1:09:29.583 --> 1:09:31.833
This is in Florence,
and the Swiss want me there.

1:09:32.333 --> 1:09:33.333
I think it's obvious.

1:09:33.417 --> 1:09:35.750
Florence, Switzerland.
What is there to think about?

1:09:35.833 --> 1:09:39.250
Let's go home. We'll be together.
You can support me.

1:09:39.333 --> 1:09:41.167
I need you now more than ever.

1:09:42.958 --> 1:09:44.708
You need me?

1:09:45.292 --> 1:09:47.583
No. I mean...

1:09:47.667 --> 1:09:49.167
Now that things are working out for me...

1:09:49.792 --> 1:09:51.958
I care about my job, you know?

1:09:52.042 --> 1:09:53.042
I'm sure of that.

1:09:53.792 --> 1:09:56.917
Have you not partied enough
with all this inventory thing?

1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:58.333
-Partied?
-Yes.

1:09:59.875 --> 1:10:01.708
That's how much you care about my job?

1:10:04.083 --> 1:10:06.833
Is it? Just about as much
you care about me, right?

1:10:07.375 --> 1:10:08.583
This is not a job.

1:10:10.583 --> 1:10:14.292
Come on, looking at saints in churches?
You've got to be shitting me.

1:10:15.708 --> 1:10:17.458
Are you being serious right now?

1:10:18.208 --> 1:10:19.375
Yolanda...

1:10:24.167 --> 1:10:25.500
Get out.

1:10:26.417 --> 1:10:27.250
I'm sorry.

1:10:28.250 --> 1:10:29.542
-Get the fuck out.
-I just--

1:10:30.708 --> 1:10:34.625
Go away! I don't want to see you.
This is over. This is over.

1:10:34.708 --> 1:10:36.042
You're kicking me out?

1:10:36.125 --> 1:10:37.417
-That's right. I'm sick of you.
-All right.

1:10:37.500 --> 1:10:40.375
Well, just so you know,
you always had a bad temper.

1:10:40.458 --> 1:10:41.708
I don't want to see you again!

1:10:43.292 --> 1:10:44.417
Fuck!

1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.833
Shit, Nathalie, you startled me.
Are you trying to kill me?

1:10:57.917 --> 1:10:58.875
Is that everything?

1:10:59.833 --> 1:11:00.875
Yes, let's go.

1:11:02.042 --> 1:11:03.458
All right.

1:11:03.542 --> 1:11:05.208
You still have to tell me
how they found out.

1:11:21.917 --> 1:11:22.958
What is Nathalie doing here?

1:11:23.583 --> 1:11:25.500
-She told me she was going to see you.
-Me?

1:11:25.583 --> 1:11:27.083
And I knew you were coming with me, so...

1:11:28.500 --> 1:11:30.375
I should've put a leash on her.

1:11:30.458 --> 1:11:31.542
Come on.

1:11:47.958 --> 1:11:49.125
Damn it, it's locked.

1:11:50.167 --> 1:11:51.583
How are we gonna get in?

1:11:51.667 --> 1:11:52.500
Using the key!

1:11:55.875 --> 1:11:57.958
My seven years as an altar boy
weren't in vain.

1:12:04.083 --> 1:12:04.917
Let's go.

1:12:23.167 --> 1:12:29.375
GORKA - I'LL MISS YOU TOMORROW
WHEN THE SWISS GET HERE.

1:12:37.292 --> 1:12:43.000
YOLANDA - I'M STAYING.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

1:12:44.375 --> 1:12:46.292
WHAT ABOUT FERNANDO?

1:12:50.250 --> 1:12:53.250
IT'S OVER.

1:12:55.500 --> 1:12:58.083
BESIDES, I GOT THE SCHOLARSHIP
FOR FLORENCE.

1:12:58.167 --> 1:13:00.083
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO...

1:13:09.833 --> 1:13:14.042
FLORENCE, SWITZERLAND...
I'D GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU.

1:13:16.792 --> 1:13:21.375
WILL YOU COME WITH ME?

1:13:27.542 --> 1:13:28.917
All done.

1:13:33.583 --> 1:13:35.333
-Antolín, time to sleep.
-No.

1:13:35.417 --> 1:13:36.917
-Tomorrow is a very important day.
-Let me--

1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.167
-No, let me finish watching--
-Please. Antolín!

1:13:40.208 --> 1:13:41.042
Come on.

1:13:44.167 --> 1:13:45.250
Good night.

1:13:51.083 --> 1:13:52.708
WILLIAM TELL

1:14:04.958 --> 1:14:06.667
Answer me, Gorka.

1:14:11.292 --> 1:14:12.833
You're such a pain, Fer.

1:14:20.875 --> 1:14:22.292
In case it wasn't obvious...

1:14:24.458 --> 1:14:25.458
I love you.

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:29.458
I love you more.

1:14:54.167 --> 1:15:00.417
<i>I apologize for not being better</i>
<i>Than anyone</i>

1:15:04.333 --> 1:15:10.542
<i>I apologize</i>
<i>You don't have to talk to me </i>

1:15:11.792 --> 1:15:17.958
<i>I apologize for not being better</i>
<i>Than anyone</i>

1:15:36.208 --> 1:15:39.083
We're back in Tellería
for another historic day.

1:15:39.167 --> 1:15:43.750
The day when this Castilian town
of Basque culture will become Swiss.

1:15:43.833 --> 1:15:46.417
<i>-Go Switzerland!</i>
<i>-Go!</i>

1:15:46.500 --> 1:15:48.333
You must be excited, Mr. Mayor.

1:15:49.333 --> 1:15:51.292
Canton President.

1:15:51.375 --> 1:15:53.500
Indeed, very excited.

1:15:53.625 --> 1:15:55.958
This is an important day
for Tellería, isn't it?

1:15:56.042 --> 1:15:57.042
Tellstadt.

1:15:57.958 --> 1:15:59.500
Tellstadt.

1:15:59.583 --> 1:16:02.458
Yes, very important, because we...

1:16:03.208 --> 1:16:04.542
We are Swiss.

1:16:04.625 --> 1:16:07.167
Because of our culture, our sentiment,
our--

1:16:07.250 --> 1:16:09.625
And like you always say,
Mr. Canton President,

1:16:09.708 --> 1:16:11.083
because of the banks.

1:16:11.167 --> 1:16:12.708
Bernabé, come over here for a second.

1:16:12.792 --> 1:16:15.250
We need to arrange these people
before the Swiss get here.

1:16:15.333 --> 1:16:16.875
-You go over there. Far from here.
-Yes. Great.

1:16:16.958 --> 1:16:18.958
-All right.
-And you go over there, Anamari.

1:16:19.667 --> 1:16:22.792
The president is coming!
He's coming! Antolín!

1:16:22.875 --> 1:16:25.667
-You gotta fix that.
-No, let's not do this now.

1:16:25.750 --> 1:16:26.958
Come on.

1:16:28.958 --> 1:16:30.292
Let's do this!

1:16:32.833 --> 1:16:34.417
Where's the president?

1:16:34.500 --> 1:16:36.542
They sent Heidi.
She has no authority. This smells fishy.

1:16:36.625 --> 1:16:39.417
After all the trouble we went through
to get the press here, they send her.

1:16:39.500 --> 1:16:41.000
-She's so uptight!
-God damn it!

1:16:41.083 --> 1:16:43.792
Let's not panic. Stick to the plan.

1:16:44.458 --> 1:16:48.083
Welcome to Tell Town.

1:16:49.958 --> 1:16:53.250
What's going on here?
Are you celebrating the town fair?

1:16:53.958 --> 1:16:55.958
Sorry, Mr. Intxausti,

1:16:56.042 --> 1:17:00.333
could I speak to you in private
for a minute?

1:17:00.417 --> 1:17:01.375
In private?

1:17:02.750 --> 1:17:04.292
What we need to discuss here

1:17:04.375 --> 1:17:07.750
is something the entire town
and all of Switzerland should hear.

1:17:07.833 --> 1:17:09.042
-This way.
-Please.

1:17:11.625 --> 1:17:13.083
Long live Switzerland!

1:17:13.167 --> 1:17:15.125
<i>-Go Switzerland!</i>
-Go!

1:17:15.208 --> 1:17:16.167
<i>Go!</i>

1:17:19.833 --> 1:17:21.917
-Shut off that microphone!
-Shit.

1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:24.042
The Swiss president
couldn't make it today.

1:17:24.125 --> 1:17:26.542
But Mrs. Müller-Gomes

1:17:26.625 --> 1:17:29.500
is here as his representative

1:17:29.583 --> 1:17:33.167
to legalize what we've always known.

1:17:33.250 --> 1:17:37.667
That we were, we are,
and will always be Swiss.

1:17:42.417 --> 1:17:45.292
Mrs. Müller-Gomes will speak now.

1:17:47.583 --> 1:17:48.708
Hello.

1:17:50.500 --> 1:17:54.958
As you all know, we have always been
of the opinion that Tellstadt

1:17:55.042 --> 1:17:56.625
is a part of Switzerland.

1:17:57.208 --> 1:17:59.292
-Long live Switzerland!
-However,

1:18:00.042 --> 1:18:03.458
I must announce
there has been an alteration.

1:18:03.542 --> 1:18:06.292
-Switzerland is going to invest...
-Look, everything's ready.

1:18:06.375 --> 1:18:08.542
-a lot of money in Spain.
-Come on. Hey!

1:18:08.958 --> 1:18:13.042
We have reached an agreement
with the government of Spain

1:18:13.125 --> 1:18:15.458
which will satisfy every one of us.

1:18:15.542 --> 1:18:17.875
What the fuck do we care about Spain?

1:18:17.958 --> 1:18:20.125
Same fucking story once again.

1:18:20.208 --> 1:18:22.500
We're only interested in Tellería!

1:18:22.583 --> 1:18:24.750
I don't understand you guys.

1:18:24.833 --> 1:18:28.333
You used to be fighting all the time,
and now you're like common-law partners.

1:18:28.417 --> 1:18:29.375
Those two clowns.

1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:31.500
Hey, what did we miss?

1:18:31.583 --> 1:18:33.458
Just this Helvetian talking nonsense.

1:18:33.542 --> 1:18:36.458
Governments from both countries

1:18:36.542 --> 1:18:39.292
are going to work together
to ensure you have everything you need.

1:18:39.375 --> 1:18:43.958
But for that to happen,
we need something from you.

1:18:44.917 --> 1:18:47.542
Anything.

1:18:48.333 --> 1:18:52.500
We want to take Walter Tell's tomb

1:18:52.583 --> 1:18:55.458
to Switzerland, where it belongs.

1:18:55.542 --> 1:18:56.625
What is she talking about?

1:18:59.250 --> 1:19:01.500
But it's already in Switzerland, honey.

1:19:01.583 --> 1:19:03.125
In the little Switzerland.

1:19:03.208 --> 1:19:06.625
That tomb isn't going anywhere
even if God himself comes to get it!

1:19:06.708 --> 1:19:07.833
Hit it.

1:19:11.250 --> 1:19:12.458
Get inside!

1:19:21.167 --> 1:19:22.000
Iker!

1:19:22.750 --> 1:19:25.167
Stay calm. Everything is under control.

1:19:25.792 --> 1:19:26.667
There was a bomb.

1:19:28.167 --> 1:19:29.958
-What about the tomb?
-It's unscratched.

1:19:31.167 --> 1:19:34.083
I took the bomb, started running...

1:19:34.833 --> 1:19:36.167
and threw it on the open field.

1:19:39.542 --> 1:19:42.292
Nathalie, I love you...

1:19:43.542 --> 1:19:44.833
like hell.

1:19:44.917 --> 1:19:48.708
And I'll become Swiss if that's
what it takes for you to like me.

1:19:49.583 --> 1:19:52.042
He's even dumber than last week.
Can you believe it?

1:19:52.125 --> 1:19:55.208
Bernabé, there's something
really important I need to tell you.

1:19:57.583 --> 1:19:58.500
Iker.

1:19:58.583 --> 1:19:59.792
What is he doing?

1:20:01.250 --> 1:20:04.500
-You're okay.
-Iker!

1:20:05.167 --> 1:20:07.500
-Iker!
-Holy crap. Damn.

1:20:08.917 --> 1:20:10.458
-Bernabé.
-Yes. What is it?

1:20:11.583 --> 1:20:13.417
Those sheep in the field...

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:16.083
-They were yours, right?
-Yeah, why?

1:20:16.167 --> 1:20:18.667
Well, you should know...

1:20:18.750 --> 1:20:21.583
that you don't really have them anymore.

1:20:22.625 --> 1:20:23.833
Shit.

1:20:23.917 --> 1:20:25.667
-Oh, my.
-Let's go.

1:20:26.875 --> 1:20:28.125
What happened?

1:20:31.292 --> 1:20:32.583
-Listen.
-Yeah?

1:20:32.667 --> 1:20:33.917
What you said before...

1:20:35.625 --> 1:20:36.500
Nathalie...

1:20:37.750 --> 1:20:39.000
I love you.

1:20:48.042 --> 1:20:51.542
ONE YEAR LATER

1:20:52.083 --> 1:20:54.208
<i>And here we are. Rockin' it.</i>

1:20:54.292 --> 1:20:56.792
<i>Mr. Anselmo is happy</i>
<i>now that the sanctuary is repaired.</i>

1:20:56.875 --> 1:20:59.958
<i>Nathalie and him bought a bus </i>
<i>to get the tourists here.</i>

1:21:00.042 --> 1:21:02.042
<i>Revuelta and my uncle are inseparable.</i>

1:21:02.125 --> 1:21:04.417
<i>The whole town calls them</i>
<i>common-law partners.</i>

1:21:04.500 --> 1:21:05.875
<i>Or lawless partners.</i>

1:21:05.958 --> 1:21:09.667
<i>Bernabé started planting apple trees.</i>
<i>I guess it's in his genes.</i>

1:21:09.750 --> 1:21:11.958
<i>Antolín still has absolute majority</i>
<i>in the city hall,</i>

1:21:12.042 --> 1:21:15.083
<i>while Anamari sorts out</i>
<i>his "unimportant details."</i>

1:21:15.167 --> 1:21:17.000
<i>Gorka got to be a contestant</i>
<i>on </i>Saber y ganar

1:21:17.083 --> 1:21:19.042
<i>and was eliminated the first day.</i>

1:21:19.125 --> 1:21:22.417
<i>He and Yolanda have become famous</i>
<i>giving conferences all over the world.</i>

1:21:23.042 --> 1:21:25.958
<i>And even though we're still</i>
<i>a Castilian town with Basque culture,</i>

1:21:26.042 --> 1:21:30.250
<i>Tellería was, is, and will always be,</i>
<i>the little Switzerland.</i>

1:21:30.833 --> 1:21:34.708
<i>I forget that you don't love me</i>

1:21:34.792 --> 1:21:38.333
<i>Especially on Fridays</i>

1:21:38.417 --> 1:21:42.417
<i>Especially on Fridays</i>

1:21:45.708 --> 1:21:49.125
<i>Don't answer my messages</i>

1:21:49.208 --> 1:21:52.333
<i>I don't deserve your attention</i>

1:21:52.417 --> 1:21:56.125
<i>I don't deserve your attention</i>

1:21:59.958 --> 1:22:05.833
<i>I apologize for not being better</i>
<i>Than anyone</i>

1:22:10.542 --> 1:22:16.750
<i>I apologize</i>
<i>You don't have to talk to me</i>

1:22:21.292 --> 1:22:24.208
<i>I forget that you don't love me</i>

1:22:24.292 --> 1:22:28.167
<i>Especially on Fridays</i>

1:22:28.250 --> 1:22:32.417
<i>Especially on Fridays</i>

1:22:35.375 --> 1:22:38.875
<i>Don't answer my messages</i>

1:22:38.958 --> 1:22:42.208
<i>I don't deserve your attention</i>

1:22:42.292 --> 1:22:45.583
<i>I don't deserve your attention</i>

1:22:49.750 --> 1:22:55.583
<i>I apologize for not being better</i>
<i>Than anyone</i>

1:23:00.375 --> 1:23:06.292
<i>I apologize</i>
<i>You don't have to talk to me</i>

1:23:31.958 --> 1:23:38.417
<i>I apologize for not being better</i>
<i>Than anyone</i>

1:23:42.667 --> 1:23:49.000
<i>I apologize</i>
<i>You don't have to talk to me</i>

1:23:49.833 --> 1:23:56.375
<i>I apologize for not being better</i>
<i>Than anyone</i>

1:24:02.750 --> 1:24:04.250
Look at him.

1:24:04.333 --> 1:24:05.792
-Disgusting.
-Cut.

1:24:07.208 --> 1:24:09.333
Sorry. Hold on a second.

1:24:10.208 --> 1:24:11.458
Come on. God damn it!

1:24:14.125 --> 1:24:16.333
Inspired by the German <i>hallenkirchen.</i>

1:24:16.417 --> 1:24:18.417
The pussy is from the Renaissance period.

1:24:18.500 --> 1:24:20.417
Yolanda Penedo, art historian...

1:24:21.458 --> 1:24:23.250
Yeah. Art hist... I can't.

1:24:23.333 --> 1:24:25.083
Cut.

1:24:25.167 --> 1:24:27.250
...visited by the <i>lehen...</i>

1:24:27.333 --> 1:24:28.167
Shit.

1:24:29.708 --> 1:24:31.333
Cantabria is a recent invention.

1:24:32.167 --> 1:24:33.167
I guess that's all.

1:24:36.083 --> 1:24:37.250
Where are you from?

1:24:39.458 --> 1:24:41.500
-Cut.
-I forgot what's next.

1:24:42.333 --> 1:24:44.917
-I'll destroy your entire office.
-Cut.

1:24:50.875 --> 1:24:51.833
Cut.

1:24:59.292 --> 1:25:01.250
Who are you calling crazy, Ricky Martin?

1:25:05.708 --> 1:25:06.792
Cut.

1:25:06.875 --> 1:25:08.083
Would you like some anchovies?

1:25:08.167 --> 1:25:09.583
-Cut.
-Go get them.

1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.000
They're getting high smoking this blunt.

1:25:17.792 --> 1:25:19.083
Cut.

1:25:22.083 --> 1:25:22.958
Shit.

1:25:23.875 --> 1:25:25.125
-The door's open.
-Great, then.

1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.333
Where have you been all this...

1:25:32.500 --> 1:25:35.042
-Where do you live?
-It's all Greek to me.

1:25:44.875 --> 1:25:45.875
That's beautiful!

1:25:49.792 --> 1:25:51.042
Keep going.

1:25:51.583 --> 1:25:53.125
-Cut.
-What about the tomb?
