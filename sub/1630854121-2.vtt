<i>CADE: I saw you</i>
<i>pocket the pills.</i>

00:04.175 --> 00:05.812
<i>We're not having</i>
<i>an issue with that again.</i>

00:05.979 --> 00:07.749
Your twins are in grave danger.

00:07.849 --> 00:09.452
Just do whatever you have to do.

00:09.520 --> 00:10.487
Please save my babies.

00:10.588 --> 00:13.861
Smaller one's heart rate
is climbing to 103.

00:13.995 --> 00:15.364
I want to see you tonight.

00:18.003 --> 00:19.438
<i>KIT:</i>
<i>And if this idiot</i>

00:19.506 --> 00:21.342
becomes our new governor, we'll
have less than we ever had.

00:21.409 --> 00:23.113
-He's polling ahead.
-Yeah, I wish

00:23.179 --> 00:24.550
-I was there to help.
<i>-No.</i>

00:24.616 --> 00:26.386
<i>You're exactly where</i>
<i>you need to be.</i>

00:26.520 --> 00:27.956
I have some good news.
They're trying me

00:28.023 --> 00:30.294
on a new anti-CD20 antibody,

00:30.427 --> 00:31.897
and I'm tolerating it
really well.

00:32.532 --> 00:34.770
<i>NEWSCASTER:</i>
<i>State Assemblywoman</i>
<i>Camille Rogers</i>

00:34.836 --> 00:37.842

00:37.909 --> 00:39.445

00:42.151 --> 00:45.625
-is a first-time candidate
for public office.
-Hey. I got your email.

00:45.692 --> 00:48.029
I'll have those OR numbers
to you by end of day.

00:48.163 --> 00:50.300
Thanks. I'm trying
to prepare for the worst,

00:50.400 --> 00:51.670
in case Betz becomes governor.

00:51.804 --> 00:54.208
-How's it looking?
-It's too close for my liking.

00:54.308 --> 00:55.410
How is that possible?

00:55.511 --> 00:57.181
Betz hasn't even held
public office.

00:57.281 --> 00:58.818
But he has millions to spend
on attack ads.

00:58.884 --> 01:01.422
So now half the state's gonna
reject an experienced woman

01:01.523 --> 01:03.293
who wants to give them
health care and education.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.863
Yeah, apparently,
that just doesn't resonate

01:04.930 --> 01:07.869
like "billionaire who wants
to slash social services."

01:07.903 --> 01:10.140
Who would actually cut funding
to public hospitals?

01:10.240 --> 01:12.946
Well, let's hope
we don't have to find out.

01:13.013 --> 01:14.482
Is everything okay otherwise?

01:14.583 --> 01:16.787
How's Randolph's treatment
going at the clinic?

01:16.854 --> 01:18.123
He's responding well.

01:18.189 --> 01:20.193
His-his team are...

01:20.327 --> 01:22.398
uh, encouraged.
I'm working on it.

01:22.464 --> 01:24.468
I worry about you
when I get emails at 3:00 a. m.

01:24.536 --> 01:27.609
Oh, it's just this election.
It's got me tied up in knots.

01:27.709 --> 01:29.680
All we can do is vote
and hope for the best, right?

01:29.746 --> 01:31.449
Can't worry
about things we can't control.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.486
Those are the things
that worry me the most.

01:33.587 --> 01:35.825
-(chuckles softly)
<i>-NEWSCASTER: Georgia's</i>

not both.

01:44.308 --> 01:45.945
Democracy needs you.

01:46.012 --> 01:47.014
We can cover.

01:47.081 --> 01:48.818
It's slow here anyway.

01:48.884 --> 01:49.753

01:53.159 --> 01:54.696
(phone clicks in cradle)

01:55.698 --> 01:56.734

01:56.834 --> 01:58.571
Unbelievable.

02:00.541 --> 02:01.644
Are you deaf?

02:01.710 --> 02:04.650
Quit checking your Bitcoin

(shouts, groans)

02:08.991 --> 02:10.160

02:10.260 --> 02:12.097
-Are you kidding me?!
-STEWART: A line

02:17.241 --> 02:18.978
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:19.045 --> 02:21.684
We're all tired of waiting, but
you gotta dial it down, brother.

02:21.784 --> 02:24.121
I'm not your brother.

02:44.696 --> 02:47.569
I'm at St. Anthony of the Cross
Community Center.

02:47.602 --> 02:50.575
There are multiple injuries, a
cardiac arrest, a blunt trauma.

02:50.641 --> 02:53.647
We're gonna need some medics
here now!

02:53.714 --> 02:56.854
♪ ♪

03:18.731 --> 03:20.802
Hey. Any exit polls yet?

03:20.868 --> 03:24.008
Not yet. But they're thinking
it won't be decided tonight.

03:24.108 --> 03:25.310
Well, if you need a distraction,

03:25.410 --> 03:27.347
I could use your help
with a consult.

03:27.448 --> 03:29.051
I can clear something.
What's up?

03:29.118 --> 03:32.191
Well, I just got off the phone
with one of my trial patients,

03:32.291 --> 03:33.961
and he's having
severe back pain.

03:34.028 --> 03:36.834
He tends to be a minimizer,
so I know he's really suffering.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.236
Which trial is this?

03:38.336 --> 03:40.775
Multiple sclerosis.

03:41.409 --> 03:42.912
He's been doing pretty well
with the treatment,

03:43.012 --> 03:46.085
but the pain is bad enough that
he hasn't been able to walk.

03:46.185 --> 03:47.321
So maybe an MS flare.

03:47.421 --> 03:48.724
But if he's not mobile...

03:48.791 --> 03:50.661
Then he can't be a part
of the trial any longer.

03:50.762 --> 03:53.968
Exactly. So I'm hoping
that we can help reverse it.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.303
Happy to take a look.

03:55.370 --> 03:56.807
How's the trial going otherwise?

03:56.840 --> 03:59.378
We're getting good results
with one of the treatments.

03:59.478 --> 04:01.583
(exhales) Well-tolerated,
limited side effects.

04:01.650 --> 04:04.756
How does it compare
to the new anti-CD20 meds?

04:04.856 --> 04:06.660
Randolph's been responding well
to those.

04:06.727 --> 04:09.131
Oh, that's good news. We haven't
been able to compare it

04:09.198 --> 04:10.167
with any other treatments yet.

04:10.267 --> 04:12.037
We need to expand the study.

04:12.705 --> 04:15.043
-Which means more funding.
-Yes.

04:15.110 --> 04:18.717
Another reason we're hoping
this election goes our way.

04:19.452 --> 04:20.688
I don't see your little sticker.

04:20.755 --> 04:22.224
Oh, I'm gonna hit the polls
at lunch.

04:22.291 --> 04:23.661
Yeah, make sure you do.

04:23.794 --> 04:27.802
All right. And we also got
your lavender essential oils

04:27.936 --> 04:30.240
and palo santo,

04:30.340 --> 04:31.677
which, if you ask me,

04:31.777 --> 04:33.413
looks like
an overpriced bundle of sticks.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.987
Oh. Padma, I'm so sorry--

04:37.087 --> 04:39.125
they only had
regular cheese puffs.

04:39.225 --> 04:40.728
PADMA:
Oh.

04:41.329 --> 04:42.966
That's okay.

04:42.999 --> 04:44.034
Look at you.

04:44.168 --> 04:46.573
Thought I could not get my hands
on some spicy cheesies?

04:46.673 --> 04:48.844
-(squeals, laughs)
-(laughs)

04:48.911 --> 04:50.648
It's about the only thing
on the list I do understand.

04:50.748 --> 04:53.453
Thank you. You have no idea
what this means to me.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.457
-I think I do have an idea.
-You know,

04:55.558 --> 04:58.463
I tried this online recipe
for keto cheesies once.

04:58.531 --> 04:59.666
-Never again.
-(pager beeping)

04:59.733 --> 05:01.870
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear that.

05:02.539 --> 05:05.778
Uh, I got to go review
some pre-op echocardiograms.

05:05.845 --> 05:08.349
But, wait, I want to show
you this amazing documentary.

05:08.416 --> 05:09.820
Ah, the Himalayas are
gonna have to wait.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.289
I'm done with the Himalayas.

05:11.389 --> 05:12.759
It's ocean docs now.

05:12.826 --> 05:14.529
-Ocean docs?
-See, the thing
about octopuses--

05:14.629 --> 05:16.533
not "octopi," okay, only
pretentious people say that--

05:16.633 --> 05:18.871
is that they're supposedly
so intelligent and compassionate

05:18.938 --> 05:21.810
that scientists think they're
a lifeform from outer space.

05:21.844 --> 05:24.448
-"Scientists", huh?
-Mm-hmm, you have
to see this one scene.

05:24.549 --> 05:26.319
Uh, look, I really got
to check it out later.

05:26.452 --> 05:27.722
I got to go. See you soon.

05:27.755 --> 05:30.728
Okay, wait, I'll send it to you.

05:35.370 --> 05:37.374
Morning, everyone.

05:37.441 --> 05:38.944
-Doctor Hawkins.
-Doctor Sullivan.

05:39.011 --> 05:40.915
Aw, they still call
each other "doctor" at work.

05:40.982 --> 05:43.888
Very professional. We all know
you're dating, Doctors.

05:43.988 --> 05:45.858
Can't stay out of my ER, huh?

05:45.925 --> 05:47.896
You know how much
I love being surrounded

05:47.996 --> 05:49.900
-by undifferentiated illness.
-(chuckles)

05:50.000 --> 05:52.539
Plus you keep slipping out
before I'm up.

05:52.605 --> 05:55.243
-Mm, a girl's got to vote.
-Uh-huh.

05:55.310 --> 05:57.882
Well, Gigi would love to share

05:57.949 --> 05:59.819
some Nutty Wheats with you

05:59.886 --> 06:01.757
whenever you're ready
to make the big leap.

06:01.823 --> 06:04.529
I was actually thinking
I'd introduce you both

06:04.629 --> 06:05.998
to Crispy Chuck tonight.

06:06.065 --> 06:07.802
-Your ex-boyfriend
from high school?
-Mm, good one.

06:07.869 --> 06:09.506
No, it's Crispy Chuck's
Chicken Truck.

06:09.606 --> 06:10.841
It's the best
fried chicken ever.

06:10.942 --> 06:12.645
You have to be on a secret list
to know about it.

06:12.712 --> 06:14.583
Letting me
in on your chicken truck.

06:14.649 --> 06:16.419
Wow, well, this is, this is big.

06:16.485 --> 06:18.356
I'm glad you appreciate
the significance.

06:18.423 --> 06:19.593
Sorry to interrupt this summit.

06:19.693 --> 06:21.095
Hundley called the triage line.

06:21.162 --> 06:23.466
-Multiple trauma victims
incoming.
-CADE: From where?

06:23.567 --> 06:25.437
There was an all-out brawl
at a polling station.

06:25.470 --> 06:26.840
Democracy in action.

06:26.907 --> 06:28.711
Let's put out
a page for back-up.

06:28.811 --> 06:31.750
I think I can beg off rounds,
help out for a bit.

06:31.817 --> 06:33.721
Knowing you,
you're gonna need it.

06:33.787 --> 06:35.490
Just try and keep up, all right?

06:35.591 --> 06:37.695
40s-ish female, head injury.

06:37.795 --> 06:39.833
-Possible concussion.
-Let's get her to Trauma 11.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.603
I'll get started
on her assessment.

06:41.670 --> 06:42.906
What was she struck with?

06:42.939 --> 06:44.843
One of those
folding chair-cane things.

06:44.876 --> 06:47.247
-Don't ask.
-All right, let's get
heat stroke to Bay Four.

06:47.347 --> 06:48.784
Asthma attack to Bay One,

06:48.817 --> 06:50.755
wrist injury to Bay Seven.
Hawkins?

06:50.821 --> 06:52.457
I'm reassigning you
to this periorbital

06:52.525 --> 06:53.761
hematoma, Trauma Ten.

06:53.827 --> 06:55.531
I'm on it. Jessica,
can you take that for me?

06:55.631 --> 06:57.401
-Cardiac arrest?
-We got a pulse back,

06:57.467 --> 06:58.904
-but he keeps going in and out.
-That one's for me.

06:58.971 --> 07:00.641
Thank you. Trauma Nine.

07:00.708 --> 07:02.344
Love the smell of napalm
in the morning.

07:02.377 --> 07:04.883
-What's his injury?
-I'm fine.
I don't need any of this.

07:04.983 --> 07:07.689
-He got tackled,
might have broken ribs.
-Hundley and I can take him.

07:07.789 --> 07:09.158
You're gonna have to find
a place in the hallway

07:09.224 --> 07:10.393
'cause we're
running out of space.

07:10.460 --> 07:11.530
-Yeah.
-Didn't I tell you never

07:11.630 --> 07:13.399
to say the S-L-O-W word
out loud?

07:13.499 --> 07:14.769
That's a made-up superstition.

07:14.836 --> 07:16.640
From a man who won't let
a sneeze go unblessed.

07:16.773 --> 07:18.510
IRVING:
Because that would be wrong.

07:18.644 --> 07:21.482
Any signs of concussion?

07:21.550 --> 07:22.952
(patient retches)

07:22.986 --> 07:25.357
Okay, ondansetron,
fluids and a stat

07:25.423 --> 07:26.627
CT for possible skull fracture.

07:26.693 --> 07:28.262
And a fresh gown for you.

07:28.329 --> 07:30.200
Thank you.

07:30.266 --> 07:31.703
How's the eye?

07:31.770 --> 07:33.674
Orbital fracture,
possible entrapment.

07:33.741 --> 07:35.745
Might be looking
at neurosurg and ophtho.

07:35.811 --> 07:38.684
And we have a possible
skull fracture in Trauma 11.

07:38.784 --> 07:41.455
-Yep.
-So let's get
Dr. Sutton in here.

07:41.556 --> 07:44.194
Hawkins, can you tag team
this guy with me?

07:44.294 --> 07:46.232
-Sure.
-He got tackled.

07:46.332 --> 07:47.467
Has acute abdominal pain.

07:47.535 --> 07:48.804
Doesn't want imaging.

07:48.937 --> 07:50.741
Just wants to get out of here.
Says it's his IBS.

07:50.841 --> 07:53.714
-And he got it from the tackle?
-Yeah, I didn't push it.

07:53.847 --> 07:55.851
Mr. Mendez, this is Dr. Hawkins.

07:55.951 --> 07:57.287
How's it going?

07:57.354 --> 07:59.091
-Heard you took
a bit of a tumble.
-But his lungs are clear.

07:59.158 --> 08:02.765
-Little angry dude lost it,
I'm fine.
-Okay.

08:03.499 --> 08:05.971
Let's take a look at these ribs.

08:06.072 --> 08:07.742
-(winces)
-Does that hurt?

08:07.842 --> 08:10.848
Told him I got IBS.
I always hurt.

08:10.948 --> 08:13.887
Well, I'm with Dr. Feldman,
we need to take some pictures,

08:13.987 --> 08:16.893
-make sure nothing's broken.
-Look, I got to get to work.

08:16.993 --> 08:18.496
The sooner we find out
what you need,

08:18.564 --> 08:19.866
the sooner you'll be
on your way.

08:19.966 --> 08:22.037
And we can give you
some medication for the pain.

08:24.141 --> 08:25.644
Fine.

08:25.711 --> 08:28.884
-Page me if his symptoms worsen.
-Thank you.

08:31.188 --> 08:33.694
-Betz is pulling ahead...
-I got the prior authorization

08:33.761 --> 08:35.898
filled out
for Mr. S's anticoagulation,

08:35.965 --> 08:38.369
so hopefully this time
he doesn't forget to take it.

08:38.469 --> 08:39.839
Most new interns hate paperwork.

08:39.906 --> 08:42.010
And you seem like
you actually like it.

08:42.044 --> 08:45.016
I mean, I won't lie, my family's
on me constantly, like,

08:45.116 --> 08:47.187
"When are you going to start
saving lives, Maya?

08:47.254 --> 08:48.156
"This is why we sent you

08:48.222 --> 08:50.126
to med school."
Of course, I don't mention

08:50.193 --> 08:51.997
I'm the one paying the loans.

08:52.064 --> 08:55.303
-Oh, immigrant parents.
Am I right?
-(laughs)

08:55.403 --> 08:56.773
-(pager beeping)
-Oh.

08:56.873 --> 08:58.911
ER just paged out
a major code disaster.

08:59.011 --> 09:00.948
That means multiple injuries.
You want to see some action?

09:01.015 --> 09:02.985
-Bring it.
-Maybe now you'll have something
to tell your parents.

09:03.086 --> 09:05.323
- ¡Sí, mamá, mucha sangre hoy!
-(laughs)

09:05.390 --> 09:07.528
Hey. Thanks for coming.

09:07.562 --> 09:08.964
Of course.
Possible skull fracture?

09:09.064 --> 09:11.503
Trauma 11, and an orbital
fracture in Ten.

09:11.570 --> 09:13.372
I'd start with the orbital.

09:13.439 --> 09:15.276
Skull can wait, GCS is 15.

09:15.343 --> 09:17.380
-Busy day.
-Yeah.

09:17.447 --> 09:18.884
Hey. I got your page.

09:18.951 --> 09:21.957
This is my intern, Maya Nuñez.
What can we do to help?

09:22.023 --> 09:24.696
I've got a sprained wrist
in Bay Seven.

09:24.763 --> 09:27.502
-That's it?
-Sorry?

09:27.568 --> 09:29.873
Guess we did miss all the fun.

09:29.939 --> 09:31.075
(man shouting)

09:31.175 --> 09:33.914
-Don't speak too soon.
-STEWART: Get off me!

09:34.014 --> 09:35.885
I just need to make sure
nothing's broken.

09:35.951 --> 09:38.156
-Keep your hands off of me!
-Hey.

09:38.256 --> 09:40.226
-Hey, hey, hey.
-She's trying
to take my eye out!

09:40.293 --> 09:42.497
It's okay, Stewart.
No one's trying to hurt you.

09:42.532 --> 09:46.640
-I want to make sure you leave
here with functional vision.
-Stop! Stop!

09:50.413 --> 09:52.250
Help! Stop!

09:52.317 --> 09:54.789
Help! Let me go!

09:54.856 --> 09:56.593
-Let's get some restraints.
-Call 911!

09:56.693 --> 09:58.530
Get this lunatic out of here!

09:58.597 --> 10:00.668
-Hang on.
-Ow! Stop!

10:00.734 --> 10:02.337
He's a vet. I might have an idea

10:02.404 --> 10:04.776
of what's going on here.

10:09.351 --> 10:11.188
(distant chatter)

10:13.192 --> 10:15.831
Thanks.

10:18.704 --> 10:20.975
Good news. CT scan shows

10:21.075 --> 10:23.547
your orbital bones
won't need surgery.

10:23.614 --> 10:25.918
-Great.
-Noticed your ink.

10:25.985 --> 10:29.692
I was Navy, too.
Corpsman in the Marines.

10:30.460 --> 10:33.065
15th Expeditionary,
3rd battalion.

10:33.901 --> 10:36.238
Oorah.

10:38.677 --> 10:40.881
How long you been out?

10:40.948 --> 10:43.119
12 years.

10:43.152 --> 10:45.958
It's pretty tough
in the Navy, man.

10:46.025 --> 10:49.231
I was a sonar tech at Bangor.

10:49.298 --> 10:52.237
Never deployed.

10:53.507 --> 10:55.611
So...

10:55.678 --> 10:58.082
what is going on, Stewart?

10:58.182 --> 11:00.353
You seem pretty on edge.

11:00.486 --> 11:02.658
I don't know.

11:02.758 --> 11:05.764
Sometimes I just lose it.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.404
I guess I'm getting old
and cranky like my dad.

11:09.438 --> 11:12.712
Well, I'd like to do some blood
work, check out at a few things.

11:12.778 --> 11:15.751
Can I call someone
to come pick you up?

11:15.851 --> 11:18.590
I'm staying with my sister.

11:18.657 --> 11:21.596
She's not gonna be happy
to hear from you.

11:21.663 --> 11:23.499
You let me worry about that.

11:23.567 --> 11:24.903
Be right back.

11:24.969 --> 11:27.340
(indistinct P. A. announcement)

11:28.810 --> 11:30.046
-(knocking)
-Yeah?

11:30.146 --> 11:31.683
Ben, Jasper.

11:31.783 --> 11:33.319
-This is Dr. Voss.
-Hi.

11:33.386 --> 11:35.390
And she is one
of our orthopedic specialists.

11:35.490 --> 11:37.995
-Pleasure to meet you,
Ben, Jasper.
-Nice to meet you.

11:38.062 --> 11:39.832
And I'm hoping that she can
help us figure out

11:39.899 --> 11:41.235
what's, uh, going on
with your back.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.542
So, Ben, how would you
compare your symptoms

11:44.642 --> 11:46.780
to your previous MS flare-ups?

11:46.880 --> 11:49.151
Oh, uh, this is
nothing like my MS.

11:49.218 --> 11:52.558
It came out of nowhere,
one morning, boom!

11:52.625 --> 11:54.094
Um, fire shooting down my legs.

11:54.194 --> 11:56.800
Yeah, he couldn't get out
of bed. Excruciating pain.

11:56.866 --> 11:59.171
And before this Ben was showing
some real promise

11:59.271 --> 12:00.306
in the clinical trial.

12:00.373 --> 12:02.143
Yeah, well, my triathlon days
are behind me,

12:02.244 --> 12:04.849
but, yeah, I was definitely
getting stronger.

12:04.949 --> 12:07.320
Of course we want
to keep you on that track.

12:07.354 --> 12:09.959
Any incidents you can recall

12:10.026 --> 12:11.295
that may have caused an injury?

12:11.395 --> 12:14.201
I haven't done anything crazy.

12:14.268 --> 12:15.838
He did help me clean out
the CD closet.

12:15.938 --> 12:17.742
Yeah, well, who keeps CDs?

12:17.842 --> 12:18.944
Not me anymore.

12:19.011 --> 12:20.748
Well, I'd like
to get some imaging.

12:20.848 --> 12:22.150
And I'm going to consult

12:22.217 --> 12:24.087
with our neurosurgeon,
Dr. Sutton.

12:24.187 --> 12:26.693
So there's a chance,
if this isn't my MS,

12:26.760 --> 12:28.764
I can get back in the trial?

12:28.830 --> 12:30.433
I see no reason to give up hope.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.640
-Yeah, we got to keep
our star athlete, right?
-Yeah. (chuckles)

12:33.707 --> 12:35.811
(indistinct P. A. announcement)

12:35.878 --> 12:37.949
Hey, I was just coming by to see

12:38.049 --> 12:39.852
if you still need
an extra set of hands.

12:39.986 --> 12:42.223
Uh, we just got a moment
to breathe, but thanks.

12:42.290 --> 12:44.461
-I think we have it handled.
-What the heck happened?

12:44.529 --> 12:46.900
People attacking each other
at a polling place?

12:46.967 --> 12:48.704
Mostly one crazy guy.

12:48.804 --> 12:50.206
Are you sure you weren't there?

12:50.273 --> 12:52.010
-The bump on your forehead.
-Oh!

12:52.077 --> 12:53.914
Yeah, I hit it on a cabinet.

12:54.014 --> 12:55.751
Doing too many things at once.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.454
Mr. Incredible in the OR,

12:57.555 --> 12:59.324
Mr. Magoo in the kitchen.

12:59.391 --> 13:02.430
Everything's fine, Kincaid.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.769
I didn't say anything.

13:04.869 --> 13:06.005
I know the look.

13:06.105 --> 13:07.842
You're sweet to worry, but...

13:07.908 --> 13:10.213
Look, Seattle was
a long time ago. I'm good.

13:10.313 --> 13:11.248
Promise.

13:11.382 --> 13:12.718
-Okay.
-(pager beeping)

13:12.785 --> 13:14.856
Ah.

13:14.922 --> 13:17.360
And if you're good...

13:20.901 --> 13:22.337
Hey, just checking to see

13:22.437 --> 13:24.007
if those head trauma pictures
came in.

13:24.074 --> 13:26.078
Yes, they did. No fracture.

13:26.178 --> 13:27.948
-Just a concussion.
-That was lucky.

13:28.049 --> 13:29.919
Oh, I've been meaning
to ask you,

13:29.986 --> 13:31.856
how's Gigi doing?

13:31.923 --> 13:33.225
No nightmares the past week.

13:33.292 --> 13:35.029
I'm hoping we're out
of the woods.

13:35.096 --> 13:36.633
-Thanks for asking.
-Must be so hard

13:36.766 --> 13:38.804
dealing with
all the parenting stuff alone.

13:38.904 --> 13:40.507
Believe me,
all I keep thinking about

13:40.607 --> 13:42.812
is how great Nic would have
been at dealing with this.

13:42.878 --> 13:44.481
Well, you're doing
an amazing job.

13:44.582 --> 13:45.884
Thank you.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.354
Gigi misses you.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.826
We should all do something
together again soon.

13:49.859 --> 13:51.663
That's okay.

13:51.730 --> 13:53.366
I'm sure your weekends are full.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.771
-Where's my cardiac patient?
-HUNDLEY: Left AMA.

13:55.838 --> 13:57.140
Said he had
to get back to the polls.

13:57.207 --> 13:59.679
Wow, that's
a dedicated voter for you.

13:59.779 --> 14:02.083
Here. Brought you a fresh one.

14:02.183 --> 14:05.056
-Mmm.
-Oh, no, we're good over here,
thank you.

14:05.123 --> 14:06.593
Well, you're not
the one who had to tackle

14:06.659 --> 14:08.295
that Proud Boy in there.

14:08.396 --> 14:09.799
My hero.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.736
He's not still here, is he?

14:11.803 --> 14:14.107
-I'm just running a few tests.
-Right, because "jerky dude"

14:14.141 --> 14:15.878
is so hard to understand?

14:15.978 --> 14:17.380
I should get back.

14:17.515 --> 14:19.084
Hey, you know,
if you need to chill him out,

14:19.184 --> 14:20.721
I got some nature docs
from Padma.

14:20.788 --> 14:22.658
-Thought it was
mountain climbing.
-That was last week.

14:22.725 --> 14:25.129
But seriously, though, there's
a cool one where this octopus

14:25.229 --> 14:27.802
thanks a guy after he saves
him from a sandbar.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.071
WOMAN:
Excuse me,

14:29.137 --> 14:31.041
I'm here for my brother,
Stewart Mayer?

14:31.108 --> 14:33.045
Yeah, Emma, hi. I'm Dr. Hawkins.

14:33.112 --> 14:34.882
I left you a voice mail.
Do you have a minute?

14:34.949 --> 14:36.619
-Yeah.
-Great.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.690
A scalpel?

14:38.790 --> 14:42.097
(stammers) Should he be
coming home with me?

14:42.163 --> 14:44.569
So this is, this is new,

14:44.635 --> 14:45.904
this level of volatility?

14:46.004 --> 14:49.478
Yeah, he's been on edge
ever since his wife left and...

14:49.545 --> 14:52.016
lately it's gotten pretty bad.

14:52.117 --> 14:54.387
But before that,
he was just an annoying

14:54.454 --> 14:57.327
-techbro mansplainer.
-Is he on any medication?

14:57.393 --> 14:59.832
Some over-the-counter stuff
when he had the flu?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.135
(smacks lips)

15:01.235 --> 15:02.738
All right, I'm waiting
on a few test results.

15:02.838 --> 15:05.443
-You mind hanging out for a bit?
-Yeah, can I see him, actually?

15:05.544 --> 15:07.147
Yeah, sure.

15:12.090 --> 15:14.227
Anybody see this patient leave?

15:14.294 --> 15:17.902
Wait here,
I'll go check outside.

15:25.517 --> 15:26.686
Stewart?

15:26.753 --> 15:28.824
Stewart...

15:28.890 --> 15:31.729
I've been looking for you.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.637
Your sister's here. Why don't
we go inside and talk to her?

15:38.375 --> 15:40.079
Trying to quit, huh?

15:40.146 --> 15:42.117
Yeah, obviously not going well.

15:42.183 --> 15:44.522
Tried everything--
hypnosis, pills.

15:44.655 --> 15:46.425
Nothing works.

15:46.492 --> 15:49.498
Taking medication
to help you quit?

15:49.599 --> 15:52.571
Yeah, why?

15:53.540 --> 15:55.042
KIT:
Ben is 52.

15:55.109 --> 15:57.046
Former competitive athlete.

15:57.147 --> 15:59.217
Diagnosed with MS six years ago.

15:59.317 --> 16:00.988
Well, I can see
why he's in pain.

16:01.054 --> 16:02.925
He has a fracture at T11.

16:03.025 --> 16:04.461
Doesn't remember
any impact or trauma.

16:04.494 --> 16:08.068
With advanced MS and
this degree of osteoporosis,

16:08.135 --> 16:09.171
this could have happened
just moving

16:09.237 --> 16:10.574
from his bed to the wheelchair.

16:10.641 --> 16:13.279
He's responding really well
to Devon's clinical trial

16:13.312 --> 16:15.216
and is hoping to continue,
so how do we help him?

16:15.283 --> 16:16.553
Well, given his comorbidities,

16:16.653 --> 16:19.191
my suggestion would be
non-surgical management.

16:19.257 --> 16:22.096
Brace, pain control
and physical therapy.

16:22.163 --> 16:23.834
Which means
he doesn't walk again.

16:23.867 --> 16:28.375
There's no guarantee surgery
would restore his mobility, Kit.

16:28.510 --> 16:31.114
I mean, there's a serious chance
he could end up with less.

16:31.215 --> 16:33.485
And a smaller chance
he doesn't survive at all.

16:33.553 --> 16:35.858
Risks we take
with every procedure.

16:35.891 --> 16:37.493
Ben is an athlete.

16:37.595 --> 16:39.364
He'll be highly motivated

16:39.431 --> 16:40.901
in his post-operative
physical therapy...

16:41.001 --> 16:43.339
Respectfully, Ben's motivation
won't matter if the procedure

16:43.405 --> 16:45.109
ends up paralyzing him,
or he ends up hopped up

16:45.176 --> 16:47.213
on pain medication
for the rest of his life.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.117
That's a real possibility.

16:49.184 --> 16:52.357
If there's hope for Ben
with this procedure,

16:52.457 --> 16:56.398
don't we owe it to him
to give him that chance?

16:57.367 --> 16:58.904
Let's present him
with the options

16:59.004 --> 16:59.972
and let him make the decision.

17:00.039 --> 17:02.711
I appreciate your caution.

17:02.845 --> 17:05.316
I will talk him
through the risks.

17:05.383 --> 17:06.920
Hey, Kit...

17:07.020 --> 17:08.489
Mm?

17:08.557 --> 17:11.495
I don't know what you and Bell
are going through, obviously,

17:11.563 --> 17:13.198
but I do know
that chronic disease

17:13.265 --> 17:15.303
is tough on caregivers, too.

17:15.436 --> 17:16.973
If there's any support
you need, I...

17:17.040 --> 17:19.110
Thank you, Billie.
You're very kind.

17:19.244 --> 17:20.981
But this is about Ben.

17:21.048 --> 17:22.785
I'm fine.

17:29.532 --> 17:31.335
Your brother was prescribed
medication

17:31.401 --> 17:33.740
to help him quit smoking--
varenicline.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.276
One of the side effects?

17:35.343 --> 17:37.815
Aggression and mood swings.

17:37.915 --> 17:39.217
So anti-smoking medication

17:39.284 --> 17:41.221
is what was making him
act like a lunatic?

17:41.288 --> 17:42.958
-(chuckles)
-I wouldn't say "lunatic..."

17:43.058 --> 17:44.227
Uh, I would.

17:44.294 --> 17:46.131
It's rare,
but it is in the warnings.

17:46.164 --> 17:47.735
I gave him
some nicotine patches.

17:47.801 --> 17:50.039
Things should go a lot smoother
once he's off the varenicline.

17:50.139 --> 17:51.275
I'm definitely getting off it.

17:51.341 --> 17:52.711
Yeah.
Maybe stay off Twitter, too.

17:52.778 --> 17:54.782
That can also cause
aggression and mood swings.

17:54.882 --> 17:57.086
Thank you very much,
Dr. Hawkins.

17:57.153 --> 17:58.957
You guys take care
of yourselves.

17:59.024 --> 18:00.493
Officer Carter, APD.

18:00.594 --> 18:03.633
I need to speak with
the gentleman in this video.

18:04.869 --> 18:06.839
<i>(grunting)</i>

18:08.175 --> 18:09.210
Is he being charged?

18:09.277 --> 18:11.281
HUNDLEY:
Excuse me, Officer.

18:11.348 --> 18:13.085
I was a witness
in that incident

18:13.152 --> 18:14.354
and the person who started it

18:14.387 --> 18:16.258
is over there trying to leave.

18:16.358 --> 18:17.528
-That's right!
-Look, I don't care.

18:17.594 --> 18:18.897
I just need someone
to make a statement.

18:18.997 --> 18:20.166
ENRIQUE:
I-- I will...

18:20.232 --> 18:21.769
He's in respiratory distress!

18:21.836 --> 18:22.738
I want to...

18:22.838 --> 18:24.341
I want to press charges.

18:24.441 --> 18:26.512
-(gasping)
-You're not pressing anything.

18:26.613 --> 18:27.681
His lung is collapsing.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.050
AUSTIN:
All right. Give me

18:29.117 --> 18:31.689
a scalpel,
a chest tube and suture.

18:39.237 --> 18:41.743
Fractured rib here
punctured Enrique's lung.

18:41.843 --> 18:44.247
Must have happened when he got
agitated with the cop.

18:44.314 --> 18:46.284
Well, the chest tube is
on water seal

18:46.385 --> 18:48.523
and the lung is re-expanding,
so he should be good

18:48.556 --> 18:50.092
-to check out of here tomorrow.
-(phone chiming)

18:50.192 --> 18:51.596
Oh, geez.

18:51.696 --> 18:53.833
-What?
-Padma.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.737
I have entertained her

18:55.804 --> 18:57.307
nature docs, I have

18:57.373 --> 18:59.244
indulged in her aromatherapy,

18:59.311 --> 19:01.381
and now she's on to astrology.

19:01.448 --> 19:03.352
(chuckles)

19:04.220 --> 19:07.126
Hey. Look at this.

19:10.433 --> 19:11.636
Hmm.

19:11.703 --> 19:13.907
Looks like some kind of mass
in his ascending colon,

19:14.007 --> 19:16.378
causing partial
bowel obstruction.

19:16.512 --> 19:18.349
When I was doing
the abdominal exam, he said

19:18.449 --> 19:20.319
-he had IBS.
-Well, that's
the catch-all phrase

19:20.419 --> 19:22.423
for unknown GI distress.

19:22.524 --> 19:24.294
Let's get him into surgery.

19:24.394 --> 19:26.298
He needs to remove that blockage

19:26.398 --> 19:28.135
before the bowel
loses blood flow.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.406
Let's scan the rest
of his abdomen.

19:30.473 --> 19:31.776
I guess it's good
he broke a rib today.

19:31.843 --> 19:34.849
Well, I'm sure Padma would
say it's in the stars.

19:35.951 --> 19:37.286
Enrique Mendez, 46.

19:37.353 --> 19:38.656
Imaging for a fractured rib
and collapsed lung

19:38.723 --> 19:40.393
revealed obstruction
with threatened bowel.

19:40.493 --> 19:41.763
Oh, looks like he could
perforate at any time.

19:41.829 --> 19:43.833
Yeah, we need to get
in there right away.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.469
-Is there a prognosis?
-Well, it's hard to say
with those images.

19:45.537 --> 19:47.473
There's likely malignancy,
but we won't know

19:47.541 --> 19:49.512
until we get in
and see the extent

19:49.612 --> 19:51.181
of the location
and the disease.

19:51.281 --> 19:52.918
And would you be all right
if I invited

19:53.018 --> 19:54.154
my intern to come observe?

19:54.220 --> 19:55.924
That depends.
She a Capricorn?

19:56.024 --> 19:57.193
Kidding.

19:57.293 --> 19:58.696
Your sister's killing me
with the astrology.

19:58.763 --> 20:00.567
-Oh, sorry.
-Sure, you can join us.

20:00.634 --> 20:03.005
Just buckle up.
Might be a long one.

20:03.105 --> 20:05.142
Thank you so much, Dr. Austin.

20:05.209 --> 20:07.781
And for the record,
I'm a-a Virgo.

20:09.952 --> 20:12.558
(chuckles)
First bowel surgery!

20:12.624 --> 20:14.995
KIT:
Here you see the fracture

20:15.062 --> 20:16.431
causing pressure on the spine.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.503
We're going to remove
this damaged piece of bone

20:18.570 --> 20:20.574
and use rods
to stabilize your spine.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.312
After some physical therapy,
you should be

20:23.345 --> 20:24.347
back to where you were before.

20:24.447 --> 20:26.953
So I'd be out of this chair.

20:27.019 --> 20:28.088
That's the hope.

20:28.155 --> 20:29.592
But what's the reality?

20:29.725 --> 20:31.763
Well, there are several
factors in our favor here.

20:31.863 --> 20:34.334
Ben's history with
competitive sport, for one.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.271
All that grit and determination

20:36.338 --> 20:37.841
will be essential
in your recovery.

20:37.908 --> 20:39.545
Nice to know
it's still good for something.

20:39.612 --> 20:41.849
-However, I would...
-And our chief surgeon

20:41.916 --> 20:44.655
here at Chastain is
a top-notch neurosurgeon.

20:44.722 --> 20:47.393
Dr. Sutton and I will
be operating together,

20:47.493 --> 20:50.433
so it's an ideal team
going into this.

20:50.499 --> 20:51.803
But it has to be said

20:51.869 --> 20:54.407
that there is no guarantee
that you would regain

20:54.508 --> 20:56.144
the mobility you had before.

20:56.211 --> 20:59.117
And we don't know that you'd be
able to continue with the trial.

20:59.217 --> 21:00.554
But if we don't do this surgery,

21:00.620 --> 21:03.459
I'm not getting out
of this chair again, right?

21:03.526 --> 21:06.264
-Nothing is certain.
-But with the progression

21:06.331 --> 21:08.636
of your MS, yes,
that is a likely scenario.

21:08.736 --> 21:11.809
Can we...
take some time to think?

21:11.909 --> 21:14.949
-DEVON: Of course.
-I-I don't need time.

21:15.015 --> 21:16.786
-I want to do it.
-JASPER: Ben,

21:16.853 --> 21:18.857
-I think we should
talk about this.
-I...

21:18.957 --> 21:20.594
I want to complete the trial.

21:20.660 --> 21:23.098
We were getting good results.
I'm not ready to give in.

21:23.165 --> 21:25.570
I advise that you talk it over.

21:25.670 --> 21:29.612
But hold on
to that spirit, Ben.

21:32.918 --> 21:36.291
-Can we talk?
-I like him, he's a fighter.

21:36.391 --> 21:37.528
I know. (sighs)

21:37.561 --> 21:39.164
That's why I'm concerned.

21:39.264 --> 21:40.767
Every patient in every trial

21:40.834 --> 21:42.170
thinks they're gonna be
in the top five percent

21:42.270 --> 21:43.272
of the best patient outcome.

21:43.372 --> 21:44.575
And as we know, patients with

21:44.642 --> 21:46.746
good attitudes
often have better outcomes.

21:46.846 --> 21:48.115
But that's not enough.

21:48.182 --> 21:51.154
Look, Ben came to me thinking he
was going to play tennis again.

21:51.254 --> 21:53.492
I've done a lot
to manage his expectations.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.564
I don't believe I indicated
he'd be playing tennis.

21:55.697 --> 21:57.333
No, but I don't think
we've given him an accurate idea

21:57.400 --> 21:58.503
of the risks
that he's gonna take

21:58.603 --> 21:59.939
just to get back into the trial,

22:00.039 --> 22:03.478
when, statistically speaking,
it may not even help him.

22:03.580 --> 22:05.449
The thing about statistics,
Dr. Pravesh,

22:05.550 --> 22:07.019
is that people aren't numbers.

22:07.119 --> 22:10.025
Our job is
to illuminate pathways,

22:10.092 --> 22:11.428
warn of pitfalls,

22:11.494 --> 22:13.298
and follow
where the patient leads.

22:13.365 --> 22:14.969
Are you saying
I haven't done that?

22:15.035 --> 22:16.338
Of course not.

22:16.438 --> 22:17.608
I just hope we're ready

22:17.674 --> 22:19.477
to follow where he's leading,
because...

22:19.545 --> 22:21.649
I don't feel good about it.

22:33.873 --> 22:35.610
Okay, Mr. Mendez,
we need you to sign here

22:35.744 --> 22:37.581
and initial here.
All right?

22:38.415 --> 22:40.554
(speaking Spanish)

22:48.335 --> 22:49.638
I need to go scrub in.

22:49.738 --> 22:51.074
Do you mind taking this
to the nurse in there?

22:51.174 --> 22:52.644
MAYA:
Of course.

23:42.209 --> 23:44.515
LEELA:
If this goes long,
you can wait in observation.

23:44.615 --> 23:46.117
No way.
I'm not missing anything.

23:46.217 --> 23:48.523
LEELA:
This is a retractor.
You can help me adjust it.

23:48.623 --> 23:50.760
AUSTIN:
Mobilize the omentum with me.

23:50.860 --> 23:54.033
Let's get a good look inside.

24:01.281 --> 24:02.551
What is it?

24:02.684 --> 24:03.920
LEELA:
(sighs) All through here...

24:03.953 --> 24:07.894
Diffuse peritoneal
carcinomatosis.

24:09.497 --> 24:12.036
-S-So...
-It's metastasized.

24:12.136 --> 24:13.305
Everywhere.

24:13.438 --> 24:15.877
He's terminal.

24:19.450 --> 24:21.656
There's nothing you can do?

24:21.722 --> 24:23.826
Unfortunately, not when
the damage is this extensive.

24:23.893 --> 24:26.331
-It's beyond treatment.
-Let's close, please.

24:26.431 --> 24:27.834
LEELA:
Would you like
to practice closing?

24:27.968 --> 24:29.404
At least you can
work on your sutures.

24:29.470 --> 24:31.474
Can't you remove
some of the bowel,

24:31.542 --> 24:32.678
clear out the tumors?

24:32.744 --> 24:34.180
Help him live a little longer?

24:34.280 --> 24:35.684
Unfortunately,
we're beyond that.

24:35.817 --> 24:37.186
LEELA:
It happens sometimes.

24:37.253 --> 24:39.525
We open someone up and we see
something we can't fix.

24:39.591 --> 24:42.029
It's a peek and shriek.

24:43.198 --> 24:45.069
"Peek and shriek"?

24:47.239 --> 24:49.177
He's someone's father.

24:49.243 --> 24:50.647
I...

24:50.747 --> 24:52.617
I-I told him he was going
to go to sleep

24:52.684 --> 24:54.487
and-and wake up better.

24:55.657 --> 24:57.093
We have to do something.

24:59.565 --> 25:01.869
How can you just give up? I...

25:01.969 --> 25:05.075
(choked up):
I don't understand.

25:05.209 --> 25:06.779
(door bangs open)

25:06.846 --> 25:09.350
I am so sorry, Dr. Austin,

25:09.450 --> 25:11.054
I will talk to her.

25:12.189 --> 25:15.764
You need to apologize to your
intern, Dr. Devi, not to me.

25:16.799 --> 25:17.901
Why?

25:17.968 --> 25:20.139
You referred to
this patient's inoperable cancer

25:20.205 --> 25:22.778
as a "peek and shriek."
I mean, you should know

25:22.878 --> 25:25.449
to use more discretion
in front of a new intern.

25:25.517 --> 25:27.521
Obviously I know
it sounded bad, but...

25:27.654 --> 25:30.794
I'm well aware
why we use these phrases.

25:30.860 --> 25:32.764
"Watering the cabbage patch."

25:32.831 --> 25:34.333
"Circling the drain."

25:34.400 --> 25:37.507
So we don't have to look this
horror in the face every day.

25:37.574 --> 25:39.912
-Exactly.
-But she doesn't know that.

25:40.012 --> 25:42.751
All she knows
is her mentor sounded like

25:42.818 --> 25:45.022
she didn't care
about this man at all.

25:46.659 --> 25:49.598
Now, help me close this fascia.

26:03.860 --> 26:05.329
Hey, Maya.

26:05.395 --> 26:07.166
Hey.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.009
Look,
I know it may have sounded

26:12.076 --> 26:14.213
like I don't care
about Mr. Mendez.

26:17.019 --> 26:20.325
But sometimes we disconnect
from our patients

26:20.426 --> 26:21.896
when they can't hear us,

26:21.962 --> 26:24.500
because when we have to talk
to them and their families,

26:24.568 --> 26:26.605
it can get overwhelming.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.910
I know it sounds terrible,

26:28.976 --> 26:31.615
but it's just a way
of protecting yourself,

26:31.682 --> 26:33.251
so you don't get
compassion fatigue.

26:33.318 --> 26:37.661
And then you won't have what you
need when you really need it.

26:40.332 --> 26:42.069
Can I show you?

26:45.342 --> 26:49.484
LEELA:
...as we explained, the surgery
was partially exploratory.

26:49.551 --> 26:50.753
And, unfortunately,

26:50.854 --> 26:52.524
the mass blocking
Enrique's lower intestine

26:52.624 --> 26:54.293
turned out to be malignant.

26:54.393 --> 26:56.097
You mean cancer?

26:57.366 --> 27:00.673
(sighs) That's why you've
been having so much pain.

27:03.746 --> 27:05.783
With this type of cancer,
Mrs. Mendez,

27:05.850 --> 27:07.721
it's likely
it was already advanced

27:07.821 --> 27:10.325
by the time
he started having symptoms.

27:10.392 --> 27:12.163
So what do we do?

27:12.263 --> 27:15.002
Unfortunately,
the cancer has spread too much

27:15.068 --> 27:17.406
for us to remove it surgically.

27:17.473 --> 27:19.812
And what does that mean?

27:20.613 --> 27:22.984
An oncologist
will be here shortly

27:23.051 --> 27:24.888
to discuss a number of regimens

27:24.955 --> 27:27.159
that may be
of some benefit, but...

27:27.259 --> 27:31.134
as much as we hoped this was
something we could fix...

27:32.303 --> 27:35.242
...it's likely
Enrique's time may be short.

27:36.211 --> 27:37.581
(sobs) No.

27:37.647 --> 27:39.651
LEELA:
I'll give you two
some time to talk.

27:39.751 --> 27:42.122
(both crying)

27:51.842 --> 27:53.579
Thank you for including me.

27:53.646 --> 27:55.415
I'm still learning, too.

28:05.503 --> 28:06.906
KIT:
Rongeur, please.

28:06.972 --> 28:09.511
BILLIE:
Another bone fragment.

28:09.578 --> 28:11.014
His bones are so brittle.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.588
KIT:
Unexpected for a man
in his early fifties.

28:14.688 --> 28:15.957
Not for a man
with advanced MS

28:16.024 --> 28:17.694

of steroid treatment.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.267
Suction.

28:22.837 --> 28:24.908
BILLIE:
I'm having trouble
with a bit of bone here.

28:24.975 --> 28:28.048
-It's dangerously close
to the cord.
-BILLIE: I know.

28:29.217 --> 28:32.323
-I've almost got it...
-(alarms sounding)

28:32.389 --> 28:35.429
We've got a heart rate
in the 160s. Afib with RVR.

28:35.530 --> 28:37.032
-KIT: What's his pressure?
-Dropping.

28:37.099 --> 28:39.470
-MAPS in the 50s.
-KIT: His heart is failing.

28:39.538 --> 28:40.673
The steroids
from his MS treatment

28:40.740 --> 28:42.276
must have weakened his heart.

28:42.343 --> 28:44.480
-KIT: Bolus amiodarone. Now.
-150 milligrams

28:44.548 --> 28:45.984
IV amio going in.

28:46.518 --> 28:48.121
I'm not sure how long
he's going to tolerate this.

28:48.154 --> 28:49.992
We're working
as quickly as we can.

28:50.058 --> 28:51.862
If we stop,
he doesn't walk again.

28:51.929 --> 28:53.231

28:53.298 --> 28:56.437
-Might have to shock.
-BILLIE: Let's move.

28:56.538 --> 28:57.807
It's a race against time.

28:57.874 --> 28:59.711
We have to finish this surgery
before he codes.

28:59.811 --> 29:01.381

29:14.240 --> 29:16.444
PADMA:
No.

29:19.851 --> 29:22.590

29:22.657 --> 29:24.026
Okay. Okay, okay.

29:24.093 --> 29:25.095
We'll just get you
into the bed first,

29:25.162 --> 29:26.464
let's get you into the bed.

29:26.497 --> 29:28.536

29:36.752 --> 29:37.954
Let's just...

29:38.021 --> 29:41.027

29:44.601 --> 29:46.237
Okay.

29:48.475 --> 29:50.078
(beeps)

29:51.014 --> 29:53.653
<i>(rhythmic whooshing)</i>

29:53.719 --> 29:55.389

29:56.525 --> 29:58.529
Okay?

30:02.403 --> 30:05.108
<i>(rhythmic whooshing)</i>

30:05.943 --> 30:08.348
There's the other.

30:09.450 --> 30:11.454
They're fine.

30:11.522 --> 30:14.293
(sniffles, exhales)

30:15.095 --> 30:18.501
Do you want me to get an
ultrasound so you can see them?

30:18.602 --> 30:22.142
I was sure they were...

30:27.620 --> 30:29.156
That's perfectly normal.

30:29.223 --> 30:33.031
You just went through
a major surgery.

30:33.131 --> 30:35.268
(sighs)

30:35.369 --> 30:37.306
It's not only that.

30:37.406 --> 30:38.809
It's like... (sniffles)

30:38.909 --> 30:40.145
...all these

30:40.212 --> 30:44.721
shadows are hiding
that I never saw before,

30:44.788 --> 30:47.761
all these things
that can go wrong and...

30:47.827 --> 30:49.296
and destroy you

30:49.363 --> 30:53.304
and there's nothing
you can do about any of it.

30:55.342 --> 31:00.620
I think that's just called
being a parent.

31:03.826 --> 31:06.164
What am I doing?

31:08.101 --> 31:10.606
I've thought more
about Burning Man

31:10.707 --> 31:13.144
than becoming a mother.

31:15.850 --> 31:18.589
What if I'm terrible at it?

31:18.656 --> 31:20.258
What if...

31:20.358 --> 31:23.866
what if
I'm not ready for this at all?

31:25.469 --> 31:29.778
Well, the good news is,

31:29.845 --> 31:32.449
you're not doing
any of it alone.

31:33.786 --> 31:35.021
Hey.

31:35.088 --> 31:38.428
I'm right here.
For anything you need.

31:38.495 --> 31:40.600
Okay?

31:40.733 --> 31:42.604
(sniffles)

31:42.704 --> 31:44.306
Okay.

31:47.279 --> 31:50.085
My sister seems like
such a fearless, free spirit.

31:50.152 --> 31:52.289
And most of the time she is,

31:52.389 --> 31:55.630
but just like everybody else,
she has a breaking point.

31:56.464 --> 31:57.867
So all the essential oils

31:57.967 --> 32:00.005
and crystals
I was making fun of...

32:00.138 --> 32:01.775
They're her way of coping.

32:01.875 --> 32:03.746
She's terrified.

32:03.813 --> 32:05.983
Of course she is.

32:06.083 --> 32:09.123
All right, what does she need?

32:14.568 --> 32:18.809
-Head injury?
-Discharged.
Just a minor concussion.

32:18.909 --> 32:20.178
How's Enrique?

32:20.278 --> 32:22.984
Eh, stabilizing in the ICU.

32:23.051 --> 32:24.855
-Tough news.
-(sighs)

32:24.921 --> 32:26.157
It's very tough.

32:26.224 --> 32:27.259
Well, you should get
to the polls.

32:27.326 --> 32:29.664
That's one thing we can fix.

32:33.271 --> 32:35.475
What?

32:36.410 --> 32:39.316
It was good being
in the trenches with you.

32:40.686 --> 32:42.489
You, too.

32:43.792 --> 32:45.128
So...

32:45.228 --> 32:48.936
should I bring by
some Crispy Chuck's?

32:49.704 --> 32:52.442
That sounds great.

32:59.524 --> 33:01.662
(sighs)

33:18.729 --> 33:20.600
How's he doing?

33:20.700 --> 33:22.604
Stabilizing.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.547
I should have accounted
for the steroid treatments.

33:29.149 --> 33:32.456
It was hard to see
clearly on this one.

33:34.059 --> 33:36.464
MS is such a bastard.

33:39.169 --> 33:41.842
You think you're on a plateau
and then...

33:41.909 --> 33:43.579
it just crumbles.

33:44.246 --> 33:46.552
Things are developing
all the time, Kit.

33:46.618 --> 33:47.319
I know.

33:47.386 --> 33:50.760
Randolph's been doing better.

33:50.860 --> 33:52.530
But it's always there,

33:52.597 --> 33:56.137
like a sword hanging
over our heads.

33:56.237 --> 33:58.609
I think I'm handling it,

33:58.709 --> 34:04.019
or at least compartmentalizing.

34:04.119 --> 34:07.694
But, apparently...

34:07.760 --> 34:09.798
I'm scared.

34:13.872 --> 34:15.141
For what it's worth,

34:15.208 --> 34:17.379
you do a really good job
of keeping that a secret.

34:19.049 --> 34:21.354
I know.

34:25.028 --> 34:27.600
There really is hope, you know?

34:45.536 --> 34:47.272
(indistinct chatter)

34:51.447 --> 34:53.484
Just the person I
was looking for.

34:53.585 --> 34:54.988
-Hey.
-I just wanted to check in,

34:55.088 --> 34:56.190
make sure you're okay.

34:56.257 --> 34:57.459
I'm fine. Why?

34:57.560 --> 35:00.198
The guy who lunged at you
in the ER?

35:00.265 --> 35:02.269
Oh. Uh, that feels like
a lifetime ago.

35:02.336 --> 35:04.306
I'm fine.
You're the one who tackled him.

35:04.406 --> 35:07.145
Turns out varenicline
was making him nuts.

35:07.179 --> 35:09.049
Huh. That's...

35:09.116 --> 35:10.185
oddly comforting?

35:10.251 --> 35:12.690
(chuckling):
I know, right?

35:19.938 --> 35:22.442
And also, uh...

35:23.144 --> 35:25.716
I don't know how to say this.

35:29.056 --> 35:30.660
You were Nic's best friend,

35:30.760 --> 35:32.864
so every time I see you,
it's like Nic's watching me

35:32.964 --> 35:34.299
through you, or something.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.603
I don't know.
I know that sounds weird.

35:35.670 --> 35:37.306
Seriously,
you have to let that go.

35:37.372 --> 35:39.577
It makes me
second-guess everything.

35:39.678 --> 35:41.447
Like...

35:43.051 --> 35:45.856
Would Nic approve
of me with Cade?

35:52.704 --> 35:55.141
Like I said,
I just want you to be happy.

35:55.241 --> 35:57.179
Whoever you're with.

35:58.014 --> 36:00.452
So would Nic.

36:02.055 --> 36:04.894
Okay. Thank you. I just...

36:05.596 --> 36:08.769
I just had to get that
off my chest.

36:09.838 --> 36:13.277

42:03.277 --> 42:06.216
for any kind of sign.

42:18.007 --> 42:20.144
What are you seeing?

42:21.715 --> 42:23.852
Maybe it's nothing.

42:24.486 --> 42:28.962
But... the other day,
I saw him take a pill.

42:29.897 --> 42:32.703
I don't know what it was,
I didn't ask.

42:33.337 --> 42:36.143
And then today, he-he had this
bruise on his forehead, and...

42:36.210 --> 42:39.584
He said it was nothing.
But he seemed jittery.

42:42.455 --> 42:45.596
Well...

42:45.696 --> 42:48.033
I don't pretend
to know him like you do.

42:48.134 --> 42:49.804
But...

42:49.871 --> 42:52.409
if he is using
while he's working,

42:52.543 --> 42:54.413
that's...

42:54.547 --> 42:56.316
that's a problem.

42:56.383 --> 42:59.022
To put it lightly.

43:01.260 --> 43:03.264
I know.

43:05.401 --> 43:07.138
Come here.
