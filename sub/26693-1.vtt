<i>Come in, 2024.</i>

00:45.610 --> 00:48.778
<i>This is Hathor 18
confirming we are inbound.</i>

00:48.780 --> 00:51.114
<i>ETA five minutes.</i>

00:51.116 --> 00:52.583
<i>Copy that, Hathor 18.</i>

00:52.585 --> 00:53.851
<i>Landing dock prepped,
ready and waiting.</i>

00:53.853 --> 00:55.586
<i>Where in the system are you?</i>

00:55.588 --> 00:57.153
<i>We've just pulled
from Mercury's</i>

00:57.155 --> 00:58.622
<i>planetary gravity
assist maneuver.</i>

00:58.624 --> 01:00.723
<i>We stopped by for a boost.</i>

01:00.725 --> 01:02.860
<i>We've engaged velocity
redirection for DEC.</i>

01:02.862 --> 01:05.761
<i>Commencing deceleration.</i>

01:05.763 --> 01:07.363
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:07.365 --> 01:08.632
<i>Watch for small
rock clusters out there.</i>

01:08.634 --> 01:10.666
<i>We've had a few outbursts.</i>

01:10.668 --> 01:12.269
<i>Thanks for the heads-up,
Lieutenant.</i>

01:12.271 --> 01:15.238
<i>Hathor 18 primed for landing.</i>

01:15.240 --> 01:17.174
<i>Copy that, Hathor 18.</i>

01:17.176 --> 01:18.809
<i>Okay, guys,
Hathor 18 is inbound.</i>

01:18.811 --> 01:20.243
<i>ETA four minutes.</i>

01:20.245 --> 01:21.811
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:21.813 --> 01:23.446
<i>Let's finish getting
this sector stripped.</i>

01:23.448 --> 01:25.181
<i>Control's gonna want this load.</i>

01:25.183 --> 01:27.284
<i>Of course they are.</i>

01:27.286 --> 01:28.851
<i>How are your pressure readings,
Holloway?</i>

01:28.853 --> 01:30.186
<i>All green, all stable.</i>

01:30.188 --> 01:31.588
<i>All good your end, Milton?</i>

01:31.590 --> 01:33.189
<i>All good here.</i>

01:33.191 --> 01:34.791
<i>Milton, I almost forgot.</i>

01:34.793 --> 01:37.493
<i>There are some sun suit
prototypes down in the hold.</i>

01:37.495 --> 01:39.729
<i>Can you test them out?
They need onsite activity.</i>

01:39.731 --> 01:41.931
<i>If you can just play around
with them for a bit and log it.</i>

01:41.933 --> 01:43.567
<i>That's all I need.</i>

01:43.569 --> 01:46.636
<i>Copy that, Lieutenant.
On my way.</i>

01:46.638 --> 01:48.472
<i>You got it, Holloway?</i>

01:48.474 --> 01:50.707
<i>Yeah, I got it.
We gotta get going.</i>

01:50.709 --> 01:53.576
<i>I'm reading some
serious seismic fluctuations.</i>

01:53.578 --> 01:55.244
<i>I'm reading that too.</i>

01:55.246 --> 01:56.513
<i>Subterranean surge
of some kind.</i>

01:56.515 --> 01:58.214
<i>Another outburst?</i>

01:58.216 --> 02:00.284
<i>Yeah, it's a big one.</i>

02:00.286 --> 02:02.451
<i>Holloway, cease operations
immediately.</i>

02:02.453 --> 02:04.423
<i>Milton, get yourself
out of the cargo hold.</i>

02:06.257 --> 02:07.857
<i>Milton, get out of there!</i>

05:31.730 --> 05:34.598
Mayday.

05:34.600 --> 05:38.067
Mayday.

05:38.069 --> 05:42.038
This is Holloway of 2024 DEC

05:42.040 --> 05:45.808
reporting from EEV Khapera 2.

05:45.810 --> 05:47.978
Do you copy?

05:47.980 --> 05:53.048
I repeat, this is Troy Holloway
reporting from EEV Khapera 2.

05:53.050 --> 05:54.584
Does anyone copy?

05:54.586 --> 05:57.557
Hathor 18, please respond.

06:00.024 --> 06:01.757
Come on.

06:01.759 --> 06:03.396
Come on, come on.

06:48.540 --> 06:51.640
This is Troy Holloway
in the blind.

06:51.642 --> 06:53.578
Can anyone copy?

06:55.514 --> 06:57.714
I'm alone.

06:57.716 --> 07:00.552
Milton and Lieutenant Harris
are both...

07:03.889 --> 07:05.921
I'm flying with limited power
and no control.

07:05.923 --> 07:09.194
Diagnostics are down.
IPS is inoperable.

07:12.264 --> 07:14.731
Does anyone copy?

07:14.733 --> 07:16.569
I'm flying completely blind.

07:21.206 --> 07:23.906
Shit. The, uh...

07:23.908 --> 07:25.274
The EEV's beacon is down.

07:25.276 --> 07:27.879
I repeat,
the EEV's beacon is down.

07:28.947 --> 07:30.550
So, uh...

07:44.930 --> 07:46.997
Ah. Okay.

07:46.999 --> 07:50.666
The PLB on my stat-band
is functional.

07:50.668 --> 07:56.206
Repeat, the PLB on my stat-band
is detectable, I think.

07:56.208 --> 07:57.240
Ah!

07:57.242 --> 07:59.543
<i>Come in.</i>

07:59.545 --> 08:03.046
Hello! Hello is anyone there?

08:03.048 --> 08:05.548
Is someone there? Hello?

08:05.550 --> 08:07.317
Hathor 18, are you there?

08:07.319 --> 08:08.784
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

08:08.786 --> 08:11.221
I can hear you.
Who is this?

08:11.223 --> 08:12.856
<i>This is Hathor 18.</i>

08:12.858 --> 08:15.091
Hathor 18, good, okay.

08:15.093 --> 08:16.726
Hathor 18,
this is Troy Holloway

08:16.728 --> 08:19.094
reporting from EEV Khapera 2.

08:19.096 --> 08:20.262
Who is this?

08:20.264 --> 08:22.765
<i>This is Hathor 18.</i>

08:22.767 --> 08:25.034
I repeat,
who am I speaking to?

08:25.036 --> 08:26.902
<i>This is Commander Roberts.</i>

08:26.904 --> 08:27.904
Who?

08:27.906 --> 08:29.272
<i>Commander Roberts.</i>

08:29.274 --> 08:30.740
Roberts?

08:30.742 --> 08:32.642
<i>I am the pilot of Hathor 18.</i>

08:32.644 --> 08:34.344
You're a new pilot?
I don't remember you?

08:34.346 --> 08:35.945
<i>Affirmative.</i>

08:35.947 --> 08:38.581
Okay, copy that.

08:38.582 --> 08:41.119
Is Commander Serizawa
available?

08:43.020 --> 08:44.988
<i>I'm temporarily standing in
for the commander.</i>

08:44.990 --> 08:47.560
<i>You'll be speaking with me
for the time being.</i>

08:49.760 --> 08:51.328
Okay.

08:51.330 --> 08:55.799
Listen, there was an outflow
of steam back on the site.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.633
The harvester's drill anchors
must've exposed

08:57.635 --> 08:59.768
a pocket on the asteroid.

08:59.770 --> 09:04.206
The blast, the explosion,
it blasted open the hull.

09:04.208 --> 09:07.913
We initiated the emergency
evacuation procedure, but, uh...

09:10.749 --> 09:14.017
I'm aboard the EEV Khapera 2.

09:14.019 --> 09:16.085
I'm drifting with limited power
and no control.

09:16.087 --> 09:21.324
The propulsion
and ACS are inoperable.

09:21.326 --> 09:24.160
Diagnostics are down.

09:24.162 --> 09:27.696
Only the comms,
coolant chamber

09:27.698 --> 09:30.802
and life support systems
appear operable.

09:32.070 --> 09:34.006
<i>What is your status?</i>

09:36.341 --> 09:39.709
Well, I've never been better,
really.

09:39.711 --> 09:42.746
Uh, that was a joke.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.348
I'm okay.
I'm drifting.

09:45.350 --> 09:50.820
I have very little power...
and no control.

09:50.822 --> 09:52.057
<i>And the rest of the crew?</i>

09:53.958 --> 09:57.028
<i>Holloway, can you expand on
Milton's status?</i>

10:01.133 --> 10:02.331
<i>Holloway?</i>

10:02.333 --> 10:05.234
Uh, Milton was in the cargo bay,

10:05.236 --> 10:08.972
signing off on prototypes or
something when the explosion,

10:08.974 --> 10:14.344
the outflow, the blast,
the force,

10:14.346 --> 10:17.881
it threw him,
and Milton was thrown,

10:17.883 --> 10:20.849
and we, uh...

10:20.851 --> 10:23.386
we initiated the emergency
evacuation procedure.

10:23.388 --> 10:26.392
- We made it to the EEV.
- <i>Is Milton deceased?</i>

10:30.428 --> 10:31.695
<i>Holloway.</i>

10:31.697 --> 10:32.695
Yes?

10:32.697 --> 10:34.066
<i>Is Milton deceased?</i>

10:36.434 --> 10:38.269
Yes, Milton is deceased.

10:39.837 --> 10:41.271
<i>And Lieutenant Harris?</i>

10:41.273 --> 10:43.373
Lieutenant Harris
didn't make it either.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.311
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

10:47.312 --> 10:49.278
<i>Copy that.</i>

10:49.280 --> 10:51.147
<i>What are your visuals?</i>

10:51.149 --> 10:52.083
Visuals, uh...

10:59.224 --> 11:01.156
<i>Please report visuals to me.</i>

11:01.158 --> 11:02.425
Goddamn it.

11:02.427 --> 11:03.396
<i>Hollow...</i>

11:04.763 --> 11:06.362
Shit. Come on!

11:06.364 --> 11:08.334
- Shit!
- <i>Holloway?</i>

11:09.868 --> 11:11.133
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

11:11.135 --> 11:12.935
Yes, I hear you.
Can you hear me?

11:12.937 --> 11:15.738
<i>Report your position.
Give me your coordinates.</i>

11:15.740 --> 11:18.373
Coordinates? I...

11:18.375 --> 11:21.009
don't have any.

11:21.011 --> 11:23.512
Just, uh...
Just listen to me, Commander.

11:23.514 --> 11:27.349
The EEV's beacon is down,
but the stat-band, my stat-band,

11:27.351 --> 11:30.820
my PLB is linked
and should be detectable.

11:30.822 --> 11:31.988
<i>Copy that.</i>

11:31.990 --> 11:33.790
Okay.

11:33.792 --> 11:36.191
<i>Uh, we're not
detecting anything.</i>

11:37.895 --> 11:39.698
You gotta be kidding.

11:41.332 --> 11:43.368
<i>Coordinates. Give them to me.</i>

11:46.203 --> 11:47.536
I just don't have
any coordinates.

11:47.538 --> 11:49.305
<i>I need coordinates, Holloway.</i>

11:49.307 --> 11:51.507
Okay, but I don't have
any coordinates, Commander.

11:51.509 --> 11:53.475
<i>Give me something.
Describe what you see.</i>

11:53.477 --> 11:55.778
How about space?

11:57.515 --> 11:59.482
That's what I see, Commander.

11:59.484 --> 12:02.285
<i>Is Hath...
visible from your...</i>

12:02.287 --> 12:04.087
Please repeat.

12:04.089 --> 12:06.488
<i>Is Hathor 18 visible
from your current position?</i>

12:06.490 --> 12:08.190
No.

12:08.192 --> 12:10.526
<i>We will be a small white speck
in the distance.</i>

12:10.528 --> 12:14.497
There are a lot
of small white specks

12:14.499 --> 12:16.431
in the distance, Commander.

12:16.433 --> 12:18.401
Nothing is visible
from my current location.

12:18.403 --> 12:21.337
Not you, not Hathor 18
or any other craft.

12:27.979 --> 12:30.379
This heap of shit
is ancient, Commander.

12:30.381 --> 12:33.348
<i>That heap of shit
is keeping you alive.</i>

12:33.350 --> 12:35.287
Yeah, we'll see about that.

12:40.826 --> 12:42.157
<i>Holloway, are you injured?</i>

12:42.159 --> 12:44.060
No.

12:44.062 --> 12:45.594
No, I'm uninjured.
Negative.

12:45.596 --> 12:48.198
<i>Copy that.</i>

12:48.200 --> 12:51.501
<i>Okay, we've detected your PLB.</i>

12:51.503 --> 12:53.203
Okay.

12:53.205 --> 12:55.941
<i>It's gonna take a moment
to triangulate.</i>

12:57.842 --> 12:59.474
<i>And is your stat-band
linked to the EEV?</i>

12:59.476 --> 13:01.143
Stat-band should be
linked, yes.

13:01.145 --> 13:03.278
<i>Okay, copy that.</i>

13:03.280 --> 13:05.483
- <i>This will take a moment.</i>
- Okay.

13:56.033 --> 13:58.537
<i>Polarized filter online.</i>

14:49.486 --> 14:52.722
<i>Are you there?</i>

14:52.724 --> 14:54.958
- <i>Holloway.</i>
- Yeah.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.460
<i>I need your medical
diagnostics.</i>

14:58.462 --> 15:00.063
I need to speak
with the commander.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.597
<i>I am the commander.</i>

15:01.599 --> 15:03.699
Standing in for him
doesn't make you the commander.

15:03.701 --> 15:06.536
<i>Commander Serizawa is
unavailable. I'm now in charge.</i>

15:06.538 --> 15:08.204
<i>Please give me
your medical diagnostics.</i>

15:08.206 --> 15:10.039
I need to speak with him.

15:10.041 --> 15:11.607
<i>You're not going to speak
with the commander.</i>

15:11.609 --> 15:13.608
- <i>You're going to speak with me.</i>
- Put him on.

15:13.610 --> 15:16.411
- <i>The commander is occupied.</i>
- Put him on.

15:16.413 --> 15:18.350
- <i>It is not possible.</i>
- Fuck you!

15:21.485 --> 15:25.488
<i>We will not be handling
this situation in that manner.</i>

15:25.490 --> 15:27.522
<i>Do you understand?</i>

15:27.524 --> 15:29.758
<i>Do you understand?!</i>

15:29.760 --> 15:32.161
My stat-band
is partially inoperable,

15:32.163 --> 15:36.567
so I am unable to give you my
medical diagnostics, Commander.

15:38.736 --> 15:40.770
<i>Then a self-examination
will suffice.</i>

15:42.539 --> 15:44.640
<i>My orders are
to keep you alive.</i>

15:44.642 --> 15:46.541
Your orders?
Yeah, who gave you orders

15:46.543 --> 15:47.676
to keep me alive, huh?

15:47.678 --> 15:49.512
Why am I suddenly so important?

15:49.514 --> 15:51.314
<i>I need an evaluation
of your condition,</i>

15:51.316 --> 15:53.682
<i>so I can report to Medical.</i>

15:53.684 --> 15:55.586
<i>That's an order.</i>

15:57.154 --> 16:00.091
Back of my head
had minor trauma.

16:01.625 --> 16:03.559
<i>Light or heavy?</i>

16:03.561 --> 16:05.161
Somewhere in the middle.

16:05.163 --> 16:06.698
<i>Are you concussed?</i>

16:09.134 --> 16:10.166
I guess.

16:10.168 --> 16:11.233
<i>Yes or no.</i>

16:11.235 --> 16:13.201
- Yes.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

16:13.203 --> 16:15.271
<i>That wasn't so hard,
was it?</i>

16:15.273 --> 16:17.773
<i>Medical is concerned
about your head trauma.</i>

16:17.775 --> 16:20.776
Tell Medical their concern is
appreciated, but not necessary.

16:20.778 --> 16:22.411
<i>I'm going to ask you
some questions</i>

16:22.413 --> 16:24.113
<i>to determine
the extent of concussion.</i>

16:24.115 --> 16:26.049
- I'm fine.
- <i>Is your vision clear?</i>

16:26.051 --> 16:28.251
- I said I'm fine, Commander.
- <i>Is your vision clear?</i>

16:28.253 --> 16:30.619
- It's a little blurry.
- <i>Do you feel nauseous?</i>

16:30.621 --> 16:32.722
- No more than usual.
- <i>Yes or no answers, please.</i>

16:32.724 --> 16:34.089
Yes.

16:34.091 --> 16:35.590
<i>What is your full name?</i>

16:35.592 --> 16:39.395
- Is this really necessary?
- <i>Answer the question.</i>

16:39.397 --> 16:41.497
Troy William Holloway.

16:41.499 --> 16:44.233
<i>Company name and description.</i>

16:44.235 --> 16:46.334
<i>Company name
and description.</i>

16:46.336 --> 16:49.539
Orbis. An asteroid
mining corporation

16:49.541 --> 16:51.840
that targets Aten, Amor
and Apollo asteroids

16:51.842 --> 16:54.379
that are rich in minerals...

16:57.581 --> 17:00.348
and compounds
positioned primarily

17:00.350 --> 17:02.251
in the Near-Earth region.

17:02.253 --> 17:04.252
<i>What is your position
in the company?</i>

17:04.255 --> 17:05.253
Engineer.

17:05.256 --> 17:06.788
<i>Full position, please.</i>

17:06.790 --> 17:09.157
Prospector
and engineering technician.

17:09.160 --> 17:12.428
<i>And your current mission
and responsibilities?</i>

17:12.430 --> 17:14.529
Maintenance control
and general purpose engineer

17:14.531 --> 17:17.767
on Aten 2024 DEC
for onsite processing

17:17.769 --> 17:24.239
for minerals such as indium,
osmium, gallium, cobalt,

17:24.241 --> 17:27.809
rhenium, rhodium, ruthenium,
platinum, palladium,

17:27.810 --> 17:29.478
and H2O.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.247
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- Oh, you're so welcome.

17:31.249 --> 17:33.248
I can recite the entire
periodic table,

17:33.250 --> 17:35.284
if it makes this
better for you.

17:35.286 --> 17:37.186
<i>This is not a time
for sarcasm.</i>

17:37.188 --> 17:40.590
Yeah, well, I'm just trying
to have a little fun up here.

17:40.592 --> 17:42.859
<i>I hope you're
enjoying yourself.</i>

17:42.861 --> 17:46.832
Wow. I thought we didn't have
time for sarcasm, Commander.

17:49.267 --> 17:50.469
<i>Are you finished?</i>

17:53.171 --> 17:55.740
Is it possible for me
to make contact with Control?

17:58.175 --> 18:00.209
Are you there?

18:00.211 --> 18:01.677
<i>Please repeat.</i>

18:01.679 --> 18:03.546
I need to make contact
with base.

18:03.548 --> 18:06.516
Is it possible for me
to contact Control?

18:06.518 --> 18:07.816
<i>Negative.</i>

18:07.818 --> 18:10.385
Negative?
What do you mean, negative?

18:10.387 --> 18:12.421
<i>It means we have temporarily
lost communications</i>

18:12.423 --> 18:14.358
<i>with Control.</i>

18:17.494 --> 18:20.196
<i>We were bombarded with shrapnel
on your departure.</i>

18:20.198 --> 18:22.565
<i>The relay transmitter
has taken a hit,</i>

18:22.567 --> 18:24.866
<i>but our technical assistant
and the commander himself</i>

18:24.868 --> 18:26.869
<i>are currently working
on the fault.</i>

18:26.871 --> 18:30.706
Why is the commander
fixing the relay transmitter?

18:30.708 --> 18:33.709
<i>We're only a four-man crew.</i>

18:33.711 --> 18:35.443
<i>Our science officer is injured,</i>

18:35.445 --> 18:37.747
<i>and I am most-qualified
to navigate.</i>

18:37.749 --> 18:39.782
You should've told me sooner
what the commander was doing.

18:39.784 --> 18:41.350
<i>It didn't concern you.</i>

18:41.352 --> 18:42.584
Well, it would've
made things easier.

18:42.586 --> 18:44.420
<i>I chose not to.</i>

18:44.422 --> 18:47.489
<i>And you're in no position
to question my actions.</i>

18:47.491 --> 18:51.227
How long until contact
with Control is secured?

18:51.229 --> 18:52.460
<i>Should only be temporary.</i>

18:52.462 --> 18:54.363
How long?!

18:54.365 --> 18:56.134
<i>Within the hour.</i>

18:57.769 --> 19:00.605
<i>We have successfully
triangulated your beacon.</i>

19:02.973 --> 19:04.907
<i>Your rapid departure from DEC</i>

19:04.909 --> 19:06.842
<i>has propelled you
straight for the sun.</i>

19:06.844 --> 19:09.411
Yeah, I kinda assumed that.

19:09.413 --> 19:12.414
<i>Analyzing lifeboat diagnostics.</i>

19:12.416 --> 19:14.883
<i>Okay, oxygen generators
are functional.</i>

19:14.885 --> 19:16.818
<i>O2 levels are green,
nice and high.</i>

19:16.820 --> 19:18.587
<i>However,
propulsion systems, ACS,</i>

19:18.589 --> 19:20.922
<i>and rotation controls
are inoperable,</i>

19:20.924 --> 19:22.924
<i>and so is the trace
contaminant control unit</i>

19:22.926 --> 19:25.460
<i>and water recovery systems.</i>

19:25.462 --> 19:27.796
<i>Cabin temp control
is also inactive,</i>

19:27.798 --> 19:29.565
<i>and you seem to have
a malfunction</i>

19:29.567 --> 19:31.334
<i>in the coolant chamber.</i>

19:31.336 --> 19:33.302
<i>The temp is dangerously low,</i>

19:33.304 --> 19:35.270
<i>currently sitting at
14 degrees Fahrenheit</i>

19:35.272 --> 19:36.905
<i>and dropping fast.</i>

19:36.907 --> 19:40.211
<i>You'll be dead from hypothermia
in no time at all.</i>

19:44.682 --> 19:47.650
<i>But the coolant can be
switched off manually,</i>

19:47.652 --> 19:49.619
<i>which is going to be
your best bet.</i>

19:49.621 --> 19:51.953
<i>You're approximately traveling
at bullet speed towards the sun</i>

19:51.955 --> 19:53.889
<i>with a labored RPM rate.</i>

19:53.891 --> 19:55.591
<i>You should be seeing the sun
through the portal</i>

19:55.593 --> 19:57.793
<i>every six minutes or so.</i>

19:57.795 --> 19:59.929
<i>Polarized filter is online,</i>

19:59.931 --> 20:02.430
<i>but only for as long
as you have power,</i>

20:02.432 --> 20:04.267
<i>and your power
is dropping fast.</i>

20:04.269 --> 20:06.568
<i>However, direct sun exposure
at this range</i>

20:06.570 --> 20:07.969
<i>will result in a burn-up rate</i>

20:07.971 --> 20:10.006
<i>somewhere around
70 minutes at least.</i>

20:10.008 --> 20:11.873
<i>And it gets better.</i>

20:11.875 --> 20:14.809
<i>There appears to be a leak
in the radiation chamber.</i>

20:14.811 --> 20:16.478
<i>You're progressively
going to be exposed</i>

20:16.480 --> 20:18.450
<i>to more and more radiation.</i>

20:19.983 --> 20:21.750
<i>Just keep an eye
on that radiation badge.</i>

20:21.752 --> 20:23.788
<i>How dark is it now?</i>

20:29.559 --> 20:31.459
It's cloudy.

20:31.461 --> 20:33.796
<i>Copy that. We should be able
to intercept you</i>

20:33.798 --> 20:35.864
<i>before significant radiation
exposure and burn-up.</i>

20:35.866 --> 20:38.467
- Excuse me, intercept me?
- <i>It's going to be a close call,</i>

20:38.469 --> 20:43.338
<i>but we estimate our arrival
in 75 minutes, approximately.</i>

20:43.340 --> 20:45.807
- <i>We're coming for you.</i>
- You can't.

20:45.809 --> 20:48.779
<i>I appreciate your concern,
but we're inbound and fast.</i>

20:51.382 --> 20:53.415
This lifeboat has no airlock.

20:53.417 --> 20:56.552
The propulsion and thruster
systems are down, all right?

20:56.554 --> 20:59.421
I have no power. How do you
even expect to grab me?

20:59.423 --> 21:01.023
- <i>It's final.</i>
- So, hold on,

21:01.025 --> 21:04.427
I'm just supposed
to blast myself outta here,

21:04.429 --> 21:07.763
and you're gonna grab me,
like in the movies?

21:07.765 --> 21:09.597
<i>With the inside of the EEV
pressurized,</i>

21:09.599 --> 21:11.033
<i>when you open the hatch,</i>

21:11.035 --> 21:13.436
<i>the force of the gas
will fire you out</i>

21:13.438 --> 21:17.440
<i>and if timed accurately,
right into our hands.</i>

21:17.442 --> 21:19.775
<i>We'll have personnel ready
to catch you.</i>

21:19.777 --> 21:22.812
Oh, well, okay, if you're
gonna catch me, then okay.

21:22.814 --> 21:26.418
I feel reassured now,
Commander.

21:33.523 --> 21:36.359
It's not gonna work.
I'm going too fast.

21:36.361 --> 21:37.759
<i>We'll counteract it.</i>

21:37.761 --> 21:40.662
<i>Our trajectory will be
parallel to yours.</i>

21:40.664 --> 21:43.032
It's not gonna work like that,
and you know it.

21:43.034 --> 21:44.566
<i>We'll improvise.</i>

21:44.568 --> 21:46.102
Excuse me, improvise?

21:46.104 --> 21:47.969
<i>It's what we do.</i>

21:47.971 --> 21:49.939
I don't think Control
would be too happy with you

21:49.941 --> 21:53.074
improvising
for little ol' me, okay?

21:53.076 --> 21:59.047
Milton, Lieutenant Harris,
I can understand, not me, okay?

21:59.049 --> 22:02.418
I'm sure that all Control
cares about right now

22:02.420 --> 22:04.053
is their insurance policy,

22:04.055 --> 22:07.088
not you potentially adding
to this shitstorm!

22:07.090 --> 22:09.024
<i>These are my orders.</i>

22:09.026 --> 22:11.093
<i>Do you want us
to give up on you?</i>

22:11.095 --> 22:12.761
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

22:12.763 --> 22:14.497
<i>Because I can tell you
right now</i>

22:14.499 --> 22:16.500
<i>that is not going to happen.</i>

22:18.135 --> 22:20.068
<i>If there's a chance
I can save your life,</i>

22:20.070 --> 22:21.939
<i>I'm going to take it.</i>

22:31.615 --> 22:33.582
It all happened so fast.

22:33.584 --> 22:36.552
I didn't know what to do.

22:36.554 --> 22:39.154
You're going to have to let go.

22:39.156 --> 22:42.426
It's so easy for someone
like you to say let go.

22:45.563 --> 22:47.132
Let go.

23:00.010 --> 23:02.480
<i>I'm going to get you home.</i>

24:13.984 --> 24:15.985
Have you made contact
with Control?

24:15.987 --> 24:18.254
<i>I told you, within the hour.
It's still being fixed.</i>

24:18.256 --> 24:20.890
<i>I'll inform you
when contact is secured.</i>

24:20.892 --> 24:22.224
Will it be possible
to make a call home

24:22.226 --> 24:23.959
through a feed
linked to the Khapera?

24:23.961 --> 24:25.594
<i>Calls home shouldn't be
your concern right now.</i>

24:25.596 --> 24:28.229
Is it possible or not?

24:28.231 --> 24:29.733
<i>It should be.</i>

24:43.247 --> 24:45.213
Was Control aware of the risks
they were taking

24:45.215 --> 24:47.882
when they ordered us to have
the harvesters operate

24:47.884 --> 24:48.950
at full capacity?

24:48.952 --> 24:50.585
<i>Of course they were,</i>

24:50.587 --> 24:52.220
<i>and you called it in
as a stable rate.</i>

24:52.222 --> 24:54.890
- But not a desirable one.
- <i>The solar flare was imminent.</i>

24:54.892 --> 24:56.859
<i>Control had no choice
but to speed up...</i>

24:56.861 --> 25:00.161
Control already had 10 million
tons of mineral ore in transit.

25:00.163 --> 25:01.963
They had to have
that much more?

25:01.965 --> 25:04.668
I mean, all this
for one more fucking load.

25:09.140 --> 25:11.006
What's that?

25:11.008 --> 25:12.775
It's your stat-band
informing you

25:12.777 --> 25:16.045
that early stages of
hypothermia are setting in.

25:16.047 --> 25:18.247
You'll soon start experiencing
reduced manual dexterity.

25:18.249 --> 25:19.914
You need to switch
the coolant off

25:19.916 --> 25:22.186
before you're unable to do so.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.988
Okay, if I switch
the coolant off,

25:25.990 --> 25:27.323
it's gonna make things warmer
in here, right?

25:27.325 --> 25:29.158
<i>Considerably.</i>

25:29.160 --> 25:31.994
Then I'll just fix it
to stabilize temp control.

25:31.996 --> 25:35.096
<i>No. The damage to the coolant
is irreversible.</i>

25:35.098 --> 25:37.932
Of course it is.

25:37.934 --> 25:40.936
All right, I'll just rather
withstand the cold

25:40.938 --> 25:42.371
than be oven baked.

25:42.373 --> 25:45.106
The EEV has evac suits though.

25:45.108 --> 25:47.276
If I leave
the coolant chamber on,

25:47.278 --> 25:48.911
I'll just fully suit up.

25:48.913 --> 25:50.345
<i>Well, according to my readings,</i>

25:50.347 --> 25:52.113
<i>there's only one
evac suit docked.</i>

25:52.115 --> 25:54.149
<i>It has 15 minutes of O2
in its tank,</i>

25:54.151 --> 25:57.119
<i>with another 15 on backup.</i>

25:57.121 --> 26:00.122
Hold on. Why is there only
15 minutes in the evac suit?

26:00.124 --> 26:02.157
<i>Evac suits supplied in
emergency escape vehicles</i>

26:02.159 --> 26:03.625
<i>aren't mission operative suits.</i>

26:03.627 --> 26:05.393
<i>They have lower
oxygen supplies.</i>

26:05.395 --> 26:08.197
<i>If you turn the coolant off
in the next 10 minutes,</i>

26:08.199 --> 26:10.065
<i>you should be able to withstand
the rising temp</i>

26:10.067 --> 26:11.933
<i>for the next 30,</i>

26:11.935 --> 26:14.068
<i>then add another 30
with the evac suit's tank,</i>

26:14.070 --> 26:16.270
<i>that pushes your survival
to 70 minutes.</i>

26:16.272 --> 26:19.173
<i>We can be with you in 60.
Did you hear?</i>

26:19.175 --> 26:20.843
Yeah, I heard all that.

26:20.845 --> 26:22.276
- <i>Thoughts?</i>
- Does it matter?

26:24.080 --> 26:26.748
Great. Shit, my day
gets better and better.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.717
- <i>What is it?</i>
- The cabin window.

26:28.719 --> 26:30.753
- <i>What about it?</i>
- There's a crack.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.688
<i>It's thermal shock.</i>

26:32.690 --> 26:34.657
<i>It can't withstand
the extremes in temperature</i>

26:34.659 --> 26:36.725
<i>on both sides of the glass.</i>

26:36.727 --> 26:38.360
<i>Turn the coolant off</i>

26:38.362 --> 26:40.362
<i>and endure the heat
for as long as you can,</i>

26:40.364 --> 26:41.863
then put on the evac suit.

26:41.865 --> 26:44.065
Do you have
a more accurate timeframe

26:44.067 --> 26:46.934
until contact with Control
is secured?

26:46.936 --> 26:48.871
<i>It sits between
50 and 60 minutes.</i>

26:48.873 --> 26:51.206
Just secure contact
for me, okay?

26:51.208 --> 26:53.307
That's all I'm asking.

26:53.309 --> 26:55.911
I need to speak
with someone back home.

26:55.913 --> 26:58.247
<i>Well, if you don't switch
the coolant off right now,</i>

26:58.249 --> 27:00.282
<i>you won't be speaking
with anyone.</i>

27:00.284 --> 27:03.052
<i>It won't be a walk in the park,
reaching that coolant valve,</i>

27:03.054 --> 27:04.719
<i>so you need to act now,
do you hear me?</i>

27:04.721 --> 27:06.657
- I'm working on it.
- <i>Outstanding.</i>

27:08.759 --> 27:10.859
<i>It's going to be colder
than Antarctica back there,</i>

27:10.861 --> 27:12.227
<i>so you might want
to make it snappy.</i>

27:12.229 --> 27:13.365
Copy that.

27:22.239 --> 27:24.073
<i>And remember, the rear units</i>

27:24.075 --> 27:25.974
<i>are outside the protection
of the radiation chamber</i>

27:25.976 --> 27:28.076
<i>that encompasses
the EEV cabin, so...</i>

27:28.078 --> 27:29.713
Make it snappy.

27:59.076 --> 28:01.112
Commander, repeat.

28:06.450 --> 28:09.485
Hathor 18, repeat!

28:09.487 --> 28:11.452
God!

28:13.423 --> 28:14.925
Commander Roberts!

28:19.430 --> 28:20.999
Repeat!

28:23.400 --> 28:25.236
<i>Hold onto something!</i>

30:04.902 --> 30:06.837
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

30:08.005 --> 30:10.138
<i>Are you there?</i>

30:10.140 --> 30:12.207
I'm here.

30:12.209 --> 30:13.378
<i>Holloway.</i>

30:18.949 --> 30:21.516
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

30:21.518 --> 30:22.950
What?

30:22.952 --> 30:26.220
<i>Did you switch
the coolant off?</i>

30:26.222 --> 30:29.391
Yeah. Yeah, it's off.

30:29.393 --> 30:31.593
<i>There was a huge depletion
in pressure.</i>

30:31.595 --> 30:33.364
<i>What happened?</i>

30:40.904 --> 30:44.206
Debris pierced through.

30:44.208 --> 30:46.911
<i>Sounds like you're lucky
to be alive.</i>

30:48.211 --> 30:50.112
Something like that.

30:50.114 --> 30:52.413
<i>Well, it's going to get worse
before it gets better.</i>

30:52.415 --> 30:54.184
I'm counting on it.

30:58.221 --> 31:01.155
<i>Everything all right?</i>

31:01.157 --> 31:02.591
Not really.

31:02.593 --> 31:05.026
<i>Please expand.
What's your status?</i>

31:11.367 --> 31:15.269
When the debris
pierced through,

31:15.271 --> 31:18.273
a piece of shrapnel...

31:18.275 --> 31:22.009
found a home in my rib cage.

31:22.011 --> 31:24.546
- Left side.
- <i>Okay, as your body warms,</i>

31:24.548 --> 31:26.480
<i>you're going to lose more blood
and feel more pain.</i>

31:26.482 --> 31:28.650
<i>We need to sort
this wound ASAP.</i>

31:28.652 --> 31:30.552
I can't feel an awful lot.

31:30.554 --> 31:33.188
<i>Precisely. Do it now and use
the cold to your advantage</i>

31:33.190 --> 31:35.190
<i>before you start
to feel everything.</i>

31:35.192 --> 31:37.058
<i>You need the med kit.
It should be in the case</i>

31:37.060 --> 31:39.230
<i>next to the CO2
absorber cartridge.</i>

31:41.365 --> 31:43.734
Yeah. One step ahead.

31:48.005 --> 31:51.006
I'm sure medical's gonna have
a field day with this one.

31:51.008 --> 31:53.141
<i>I need you
to breathe in for me.</i>

31:53.143 --> 31:55.276
<i>A big, deep inhale.</i>

31:57.548 --> 32:00.082
<i>Did that hurt?</i>

32:00.084 --> 32:01.083
Like hell.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.651
Put Serizawa on.

32:03.653 --> 32:06.020
<i>That's a negative.</i>

32:06.022 --> 32:08.256
There's nothing stopping you

32:08.258 --> 32:11.526
from putting me through
to his comms unit.

32:11.528 --> 32:14.729
The commander and I
are good friends.

32:14.731 --> 32:16.631
I just need to talk to him.

32:16.633 --> 32:17.699
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

32:17.701 --> 32:19.367
Just put him on.

32:19.369 --> 32:20.535
<i>Holloway...</i>

32:20.537 --> 32:22.403
Just put him on!

32:27.144 --> 32:29.478
It's out. It's out.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.014
<i>Okay, we need to
stop the bleeding.</i>

32:32.016 --> 32:35.249
Yeah, well, please feel free in
stating the obvious, Commander.

32:35.251 --> 32:37.318
<i>Just doing my job.</i>

32:37.320 --> 32:39.720
<i>You need something that would
cauterize the wound.</i>

32:39.722 --> 32:41.590
<i>Look around,
see what you can find.</i>

32:41.592 --> 32:43.728
<i>You might need
to improvise something.</i>

33:04.248 --> 33:06.616
Milton's got these...

33:10.386 --> 33:12.120
prototypes.

33:12.122 --> 33:15.724
<i>They're the prototypes
Control sent to DEC.</i>

33:15.726 --> 33:19.161
<i>Electromagnetic hand grips
for maintenance purposes.</i>

33:19.163 --> 33:21.363
So not gonna stop
the bleeding.

33:21.365 --> 33:23.166
<i>No.</i>

33:32.142 --> 33:35.177
<i>Look, it's getting warmer
every second.</i>

33:35.179 --> 33:36.777
<i>Come on, talk to me.</i>

33:36.779 --> 33:38.646
<i>We need to stop the bleeding,
Holloway.</i>

33:38.648 --> 33:40.248
Yeah, I know.

33:40.250 --> 33:41.615
<i>Talk me through
what you're doing.</i>

35:43.974 --> 35:44.975
Commander.

35:48.844 --> 35:50.445
Commander Roberts.

35:50.447 --> 35:52.447
<i>We must keep in contact
at all times.</i>

35:52.449 --> 35:53.748
<i>This isn't a game.</i>

35:53.750 --> 35:55.450
I know it's not a game.

35:55.452 --> 35:57.952
<i>Did you cauterize the wound?</i>

35:57.954 --> 35:59.653
- Yes.
- <i>How?</i>

35:59.655 --> 36:01.592
Found a way.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.894
<i>Okay. Just be aware</i>

36:06.896 --> 36:08.630
<i>your body won't have time
to acclimatize</i>

36:08.632 --> 36:10.231
<i>to the rapid temp increase.</i>

36:10.233 --> 36:13.403
<i>The pain and discomfort
will get worse.</i>

36:17.940 --> 36:20.242
Give me Serizawa.

36:20.244 --> 36:22.309
- <i>Holloway, there's something...</i>
- I'd like to speak with him.

36:22.311 --> 36:23.845
<i>Would you just listen to me?</i>

36:23.847 --> 36:25.679
There's nothing stopping you
putting me through.

36:25.681 --> 36:26.981
<i>I just need to tell you
something.</i>

36:26.983 --> 36:28.883
Just put him on the line
for me, all right?

36:28.885 --> 36:33.691
<i>Shut up and listen to me!
Commander Serizawa is dead!</i>

36:36.726 --> 36:39.526
<i>The damage we received
from the shrapnel cluster was,</i>

36:39.528 --> 36:41.396
<i>it was substantial,</i>

36:41.398 --> 36:43.530
<i>and the life support conduits
needed fixing.</i>

36:43.532 --> 36:45.967
<i>We had minutes
until we had no air to breathe.</i>

36:45.969 --> 36:47.568
<i>More debris was inbound,</i>

36:47.570 --> 36:50.540
<i>and Serizawa's suit
was damaged.</i>

36:52.342 --> 36:55.976
<i>His coolant regulators split.</i>

36:55.978 --> 36:58.315
<i>He drowned in his suit.</i>

36:59.815 --> 37:02.252
<i>He died saving us.</i>

37:06.657 --> 37:08.990
Why didn't you tell me this
from the get-go?

37:08.992 --> 37:13.028
<i>I knew you were close
to the Commander.</i>

37:13.030 --> 37:15.729
<i>I needed you stable.</i>

37:15.731 --> 37:17.831
You should've told me.

37:17.833 --> 37:20.034
- <i>It wasn't the right time.</i>
- You should've told me.

37:20.036 --> 37:22.737
<i>What difference
would it have made?</i>

37:22.739 --> 37:24.805
Because I needed him
to do something for me.

37:24.807 --> 37:27.478
<i>Holloway, debris inbound!</i>

37:37.621 --> 37:40.487
<i>Holloway, are you okay?</i>

37:40.489 --> 37:42.990
- <i>Holloway!</i>
- I'm spinning.

37:42.992 --> 37:46.764
<i>Okay. I'm analyzing
the Khapera's rotation.</i>

37:59.608 --> 38:04.345
<i>The Khapera's rotation,
it's around 69, 70 RPM.</i>

38:04.347 --> 38:06.014
Make it stop.

38:06.016 --> 38:08.686
<i>I can't.
It's not going to stop.</i>

38:15.659 --> 38:17.092
<i>Just breathe, Holloway,
and try to...</i>

38:17.094 --> 38:19.630
You've gotta turn back.

38:23.599 --> 38:25.900
<i>Holloway, repeat, I...</i>

38:25.902 --> 38:28.068
You and the rest of your crew,

38:28.070 --> 38:31.572
you gotta turn back
or more people are gonna die.

38:31.574 --> 38:35.677
<i>I'm not giving up.
We're not turning back.</i>

38:35.679 --> 38:37.845
<i>Holloway, can you hear...</i>

38:37.847 --> 38:39.416
<i>Holloway!</i>

38:52.829 --> 38:55.099
<i>Can you hear me?
What's happening?</i>

38:57.900 --> 39:00.070
<i>Holloway, respond.</i>

39:02.905 --> 39:04.407
<i>Answer me.</i>

39:07.476 --> 39:08.913
<i>What's happening?</i>

39:12.715 --> 39:13.717
<i>Holloway.</i>

40:31.760 --> 40:33.163
Commander.

40:36.599 --> 40:39.800
If I'm alive,
you're still coming for me.

40:39.802 --> 40:41.172
<i>What do you mean?</i>

40:44.273 --> 40:47.242
<i>Holloway, what are you doing?</i>

40:47.244 --> 40:48.742
What's right.

40:48.744 --> 40:50.177
<i>Don't you even think about it.</i>

40:50.179 --> 40:52.246
<i>Don't you dare
open that hatch.</i>

40:52.248 --> 40:54.115
<i>We can secure contact.</i>

40:54.117 --> 40:56.586
<i>You can still
make that call home.</i>

41:26.215 --> 41:28.551
<i>Let me save you!</i>

42:35.684 --> 42:36.853
<i>Holloway.</i>

42:44.126 --> 42:46.130
<i>Please answer me.</i>

42:52.869 --> 42:54.805
<i>Please say something.</i>

43:10.019 --> 43:11.788
I'm here.

43:15.291 --> 43:16.927
<i>Thank God.</i>

43:19.795 --> 43:21.898
<i>What's your status?</i>

43:25.135 --> 43:26.337
Warm.

43:28.304 --> 43:30.240
Pretty bad headache.

43:42.184 --> 43:43.316
Commander?

43:43.318 --> 43:45.787
<i>Yeah.</i>

43:45.789 --> 43:50.425
Can you talk me through
the current approximated stats?

43:50.427 --> 43:53.126
<i>Okay.</i>

43:53.128 --> 43:57.298
<i>The Khapera will burn up
in approximately 40 minutes.</i>

43:57.300 --> 44:00.068
<i>You should, however, be able
to endure the rising temp</i>

44:00.070 --> 44:01.936
<i>for at least another 10.</i>

44:01.938 --> 44:04.304
<i>You have 15 minutes O2
in the suit's tank,</i>

44:04.306 --> 44:06.173
<i>then another 15 on backup,</i>

44:06.175 --> 44:10.010
<i>and we estimate that we can
be with you in about 35.</i>

44:10.012 --> 44:12.246
<i>And at this rate, you'll have
enough gas inside the EEV</i>

44:12.248 --> 44:13.914
<i>to blast you out.</i>

44:13.916 --> 44:16.016
<i>It's going to be like a furnace
in there</i>

44:16.018 --> 44:17.985
<i>within the next few minutes
or so.</i>

44:17.987 --> 44:21.322
<i>You need to endure the rising
temp for as long as you can.</i>

44:21.324 --> 44:25.159
And a revised estimation
on when...

44:25.161 --> 44:27.829
contact will be secured
with Control.

44:27.831 --> 44:30.063
<i>Um...</i>

44:30.065 --> 44:33.300
<i>Around the same time as
our arrival, approximately.</i>

44:33.302 --> 44:35.470
Can you make that sooner?

44:35.472 --> 44:38.271
<i>With Serizawa gone, it's down
to our technical assistant</i>

44:38.273 --> 44:41.476
<i>to fix the transmitter now.</i>

44:41.478 --> 44:47.447
<i>He's on his own out there,
but he's doing what he can.</i>

44:47.449 --> 44:50.119
I need you to call home.

44:53.856 --> 44:55.826
I need to speak with her.

44:58.527 --> 45:02.162
<i>Would you like me
to record that message?</i>

45:05.168 --> 45:07.104
<i>Just in case.</i>

45:09.072 --> 45:12.507
I'll tell her myself.

45:12.509 --> 45:15.075
<i>Must be pretty scary
out there.</i>

45:15.077 --> 45:17.213
It's not so bad...

45:19.849 --> 45:21.919
once you get used to it.

45:25.188 --> 45:28.421
<i>You know, I never wanted
to work for the mining corp</i>

45:28.423 --> 45:30.458
<i>or be a pilot.</i>

45:30.460 --> 45:32.325
<i>My father worked
for the company,</i>

45:32.327 --> 45:34.028
<i>and once the ships
were in the air,</i>

45:34.030 --> 45:38.999
<i>he was contracted to pilot
Hathor 1.</i>

45:39.001 --> 45:43.237
<i>But he had a fall
before his first assignment.</i>

45:43.239 --> 45:48.378
<i>The result was a concussion
that terminated his contract.</i>

45:58.353 --> 46:02.255
<i>It wasn't until then
that my father encouraged me</i>

46:02.257 --> 46:05.892
<i>to look into the position.</i>

46:05.894 --> 46:11.367
<i>It was a long shot,
but I thought I'd give it a go.</i>

46:14.269 --> 46:17.972
<i>I got the right education,</i>

46:17.974 --> 46:20.173
<i>passed the right exams
and tests,</i>

46:20.175 --> 46:25.880
<i>and 17 years later,
here I am,</i>

46:25.882 --> 46:29.316
<i>the pilot of Hathor 18.</i>

46:29.318 --> 46:32.452
And commander.

46:32.454 --> 46:34.391
<i>By default.</i>

46:40.262 --> 46:42.865
<i>Tell me something
about yourself.</i>

46:45.934 --> 46:48.070
Something about myself?

46:54.277 --> 46:56.244
I'm thinking
of early retirement.

46:59.481 --> 47:01.581
<i>I take it
that's a new development.</i>

47:01.583 --> 47:03.920
After today? Yeah.

47:17.599 --> 47:19.569
I need to tell her I'm sorry.

47:23.606 --> 47:25.876
<i>That's all
you want her to know?</i>

47:31.347 --> 47:33.283
That's all she needs to know.

47:37.085 --> 47:39.021
That's all I have to say.

47:44.226 --> 47:46.896
<i>You know,
you remind me of someone.</i>

47:51.434 --> 47:53.403
<i>Someone I once knew.</i>

47:58.307 --> 48:00.576
<i>Someone who lived in the past.</i>

48:05.581 --> 48:07.951
<i>Too busy being sorry.</i>

48:17.427 --> 48:18.929
<i>What happened?</i>

48:23.632 --> 48:25.902
<i>Why are you so sorry?</i>

48:42.150 --> 48:43.416
We had a son.

49:09.277 --> 49:12.412
<i>Holloway, what's going on
over there?</i>

49:12.414 --> 49:14.284
<i>You're losing pressure.</i>

50:36.699 --> 50:38.335
Commander Roberts?

50:41.704 --> 50:43.407
Roberts, you there?

50:54.349 --> 50:56.185
Commander Roberts.

50:59.655 --> 51:01.091
<i>Holloway.</i>

51:02.824 --> 51:04.093
<i>Holloway.</i>

51:05.695 --> 51:08.762
- I can hear you.
- <i>Are you all right?</i>

51:08.764 --> 51:11.068
<i>It was another
shrapnel cluster.</i>

51:13.835 --> 51:15.401
All right.

51:15.403 --> 51:17.704
Evac suit's on.

51:17.706 --> 51:19.375
<i>Give me your stats.</i>

51:23.679 --> 51:27.514
<i>Life support battery,
95 percent.</i>

51:27.516 --> 51:29.150
<i>O2, 18 percent.</i>

51:29.152 --> 51:30.818
You hearing that?

51:30.820 --> 51:32.820
<i>Yeah, I got it.</i>

51:32.822 --> 51:36.356
<i>Holloway,
there's been a breach.</i>

51:36.358 --> 51:39.760
<i>The inside of the Khapera is
now completely depressurized.</i>

51:39.762 --> 51:44.298
<i>The O2, CO2, nitrogen, it...
it's all gone.</i>

51:44.300 --> 51:46.432
<i>Systems have automatically
locked down access</i>

51:46.434 --> 51:48.769
<i>to the remaining O2 supply
and the backup tank.</i>

51:48.771 --> 51:50.604
<i>Your damaged controls
will not allow you</i>

51:50.606 --> 51:52.505
<i>to override it manually.</i>

51:52.507 --> 51:55.441
<i>The only option would be
a spacewalk to fix the damage</i>

51:55.443 --> 51:56.911
<i>and allow access
to the remaining O2.</i>

51:56.913 --> 51:58.679
<i>That would grant you
the pressure needed</i>

51:58.681 --> 52:00.613
<i>to blast you out.</i>

52:00.615 --> 52:03.717
<i>But you have no tether.
A spacewalk is impossible.</i>

52:03.719 --> 52:06.487
<i>And the radiation
and heat exposure,</i>

52:06.489 --> 52:09.590
<i>even with a suit on,
you'd be dead within minutes.</i>

52:09.592 --> 52:11.528
<i>There's nothing we can do.</i>

52:13.461 --> 52:16.296
I know all that.

52:16.298 --> 52:17.701
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

52:19.268 --> 52:23.336
You and your crew
need to turn back.

52:23.338 --> 52:25.338
You can turn back
and still link the call...

52:25.340 --> 52:26.574
<i>I can't.</i>

52:26.576 --> 52:27.675
...to home.

52:27.677 --> 52:29.209
<i>I can't turn back.</i>

52:29.211 --> 52:31.211
You can for the safety
of your crew.

52:31.213 --> 52:32.412
<i>I can't.</i>

52:32.414 --> 52:35.583
<i>You can, Commander.</i>

52:35.585 --> 52:38.918
<i>Look, before we lost contact
with Control,</i>

52:38.920 --> 52:41.454
<i>they ordered us
to come and get you.</i>

52:41.456 --> 52:43.456
<i>A strict order was given.</i>

52:43.458 --> 52:47.795
<i>At least one member of the crew
on 2024 must survive.</i>

52:47.797 --> 52:49.798
<i>It's not my call.</i>

52:51.634 --> 52:53.566
<i>A catastrophe like this,</i>

52:53.568 --> 52:56.470
<i>with all crew members deceased
as the result of an accident,</i>

52:56.472 --> 52:58.271
<i>will cripple
the entire program,</i>

52:58.273 --> 52:59.873
<i>potentially resulting
in a permanent shutdown</i>

52:59.875 --> 53:01.775
<i>of the company,</i>

53:01.777 --> 53:04.711
<i>taking all related programs
and organizations with it.</i>

53:04.713 --> 53:07.280
<i>Best case scenario,
with you alive,</i>

53:07.282 --> 53:08.715
<i>is a several-year hiatus,</i>

53:08.717 --> 53:10.483
<i>where a full,
intense investigation</i>

53:10.485 --> 53:12.485
<i>and accident review

53:12.487 --> 53:14.021
<i>With you deceased</i>

53:14.023 --> 53:17.724
<i>is a guaranteed
immediate termination.</i>

53:17.726 --> 53:20.894
<i>Your life determines
the fate of Orbis.</i>

53:20.896 --> 53:24.331
<i>You're the priority right now.</i>

53:24.333 --> 53:26.333
So I guess you're not coming

53:26.335 --> 53:29.769
out of the good nature
of your heart after all.

53:29.771 --> 53:33.007
- <i>It's not like that.</i>
- Then what is it like?

53:33.009 --> 53:35.876
<i>I would be coming for you,
regardless of my orders.</i>

53:35.878 --> 53:38.248
Oh, look, I'm flattered,
Commander.

53:39.949 --> 53:41.483
Really, I am.

53:44.387 --> 53:46.356
I'm dead anyway.

53:48.757 --> 53:50.859
The radiation's got me.

53:55.764 --> 53:57.701
<i>I'm not turning back.</i>

54:41.077 --> 54:43.680
My son was making something.

54:46.748 --> 54:48.317
These...

54:50.119 --> 54:51.821
inventions.

54:54.090 --> 54:57.990
He'd just go around,

54:57.992 --> 55:02.032
grabbing stuff
and then make something.

55:03.932 --> 55:07.767
Good things.
I mean, he was good.

55:07.769 --> 55:08.972
Smart.

55:21.951 --> 55:23.420
He was six.

55:37.900 --> 55:40.737
I had the chance
to do something right.

55:44.907 --> 55:47.410
To make the right decisions.

55:55.617 --> 55:57.019
But I didn't.

56:00.956 --> 56:03.593
I chose to just run away.

56:05.894 --> 56:07.994
To go to a dark place
no one goes,

56:07.996 --> 56:12.402
somewhere... far away.

56:19.541 --> 56:21.043
Just left.

56:25.947 --> 56:28.050
I just need to tell her
I'm sorry.

56:29.985 --> 56:34.054
<i>Are you sure that
that's all she needs to hear,</i>

56:34.056 --> 56:35.858
<i>that you're sorry?</i>

56:38.059 --> 56:40.864
<i>I lost my daughter
seven years ago.</i>

56:42.530 --> 56:43.967
<i>She was twelve.</i>

56:46.802 --> 56:48.836
<i>My husband couldn't cope.</i>

56:48.838 --> 56:51.637
<i>He left me.</i>

56:51.639 --> 56:54.009
<i>He left me
when I needed him most.</i>

56:56.478 --> 56:58.744
<i>Do you know
he left me a note?</i>

56:58.746 --> 57:02.048
<i>It didn't say
how much he loved me</i>

57:02.050 --> 57:05.786
<i>or how happy our lives
had been together.</i>

57:05.788 --> 57:07.887
<i>Nothing like that.</i>

57:07.889 --> 57:10.057
<i>It just said...</i>

57:10.059 --> 57:12.495
<i>"Eva, I'm sorry."</i>

57:15.965 --> 57:18.164
<i>If I could speak to him today,
I'd pray to God</i>

57:18.166 --> 57:21.702
<i>that he wouldn't tell me
how sorry he was.</i>

57:21.704 --> 57:23.269
<i>I dream he would just
hold me in his arms</i>

57:23.271 --> 57:26.840
<i>and tell me
how much he loved me.</i>

57:26.842 --> 57:30.077
<i>I wouldn't want his apologies.</i>

57:30.079 --> 57:33.483
<i>I'd just want him.</i>

57:39.621 --> 57:41.990
I need to sign out for a sec.

57:45.693 --> 57:47.096
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:02:38.119 --> 01:02:39.985
Roberts, you there?

01:02:39.987 --> 01:02:41.220
<i>I'm here.</i>

01:02:41.222 --> 01:02:43.856
If I seal the outside
of the Khapera,

01:02:43.858 --> 01:02:48.128
will that definitely allow me
access to the remaining O2?

01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:50.063
<i>In theory, yes.</i>

01:02:50.065 --> 01:02:52.898
And that'll be enough
to re-pressurize this cabin

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.900
and blast me outta here?

01:02:54.902 --> 01:02:57.369
<i>Well, only if you had a way
of getting out there.</i>

01:02:57.371 --> 01:03:00.307
<i>Electromagnetic
grip enhancements</i>

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:02.175
<i>linked to life support
mainframe.</i>

01:03:02.177 --> 01:03:03.943
I think I do.

01:03:03.945 --> 01:03:06.246
<i>Power, 100 percent.</i>

01:03:06.248 --> 01:03:09.215
I'm gonna try
these new prototypes.

01:03:09.217 --> 01:03:11.584
<i>Milton didn't even get a chance
to test them.</i>

01:03:11.586 --> 01:03:13.887
<i>They might not work.
It's 50-50.</i>

01:03:13.889 --> 01:03:17.958
Well, those are the best odds
I've had all day.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.327
<i>You will be exposed to
100% solar intensity out there,</i>

01:03:21.329 --> 01:03:23.063
<i>and it'll take too long to fix.</i>

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:26.465
<i>It's over 700 degrees
in direct light.</i>

01:03:26.467 --> 01:03:29.568
Okay, then I'll fix it
in the shade.

01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:31.972
Look, you still have
the ability

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:34.474
to analyze the rotation
of the EEV

01:03:34.476 --> 01:03:36.376
to keep me on the shaded side
of the Khapera.

01:03:36.378 --> 01:03:38.211
<i>Radiation levels
are off the chart.</i>

01:03:38.213 --> 01:03:39.612
Radiation badge
is already black.

01:03:39.614 --> 01:03:41.883
<i>You won't have enough time.</i>

01:03:43.952 --> 01:03:45.452
This is the only chance
I've got.

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:47.354
<i>It's only going to take
another 15 minutes</i>

01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:49.222
<i>before we're able
to contact home.</i>

01:03:49.224 --> 01:03:51.891
Can you guarantee
that timeframe?

01:03:51.893 --> 01:03:53.927
<i>Negative.</i>

01:03:53.929 --> 01:03:57.463
Okay, so I'm going to need you
to guide me through this.

01:03:57.465 --> 01:04:01.166
Roberts, have I got
your support or not?

01:04:01.168 --> 01:04:02.538
<i>Of course you do.</i>

01:04:04.172 --> 01:04:06.072
<i>The damaged area
will be situated</i>

01:04:06.074 --> 01:04:07.374
<i>by the oxygen generators,</i>

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:09.441
<i>directly above
the CO2 scrubbers.</i>

01:04:09.443 --> 01:04:11.577
Right on top.

01:04:11.579 --> 01:04:13.915
<i>Tell me when you're ready.</i>

01:04:16.284 --> 01:04:17.450
Ready as I'll ever be.

01:04:17.452 --> 01:04:19.452
<i>O2 count activated.</i>

01:04:19.454 --> 01:04:21.457
<i>Allow further rotation.</i>

01:04:59.695 --> 01:05:01.364
<i>Stand by.</i>

01:05:17.713 --> 01:05:20.246
<i>Ten...</i>

01:05:20.248 --> 01:05:22.682
<i>nine...</i>

01:05:22.684 --> 01:05:24.985

01:05:27.121 --> 01:05:29.488

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:31.624

01:05:36.398 --> 01:05:38.630
<i>two...</i>

01:05:38.632 --> 01:05:40.467
<i>one.</i>

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:42.438
<i>You are clear to go.</i>

01:06:15.737 --> 01:06:18.641
<i>O2, 11 percent.</i>

01:07:00.849 --> 01:07:03.416
Climbing starboard.

01:07:03.418 --> 01:07:05.117
Bow to my left.

01:07:05.119 --> 01:07:06.351
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:07:06.353 --> 01:07:08.223
<i>Nice and steady.</i>

01:07:13.561 --> 01:07:17.429
What's the temp in the shade?

01:07:17.431 --> 01:07:19.298
<i>Minus 150.</i>

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:20.633
Oof!

01:07:20.635 --> 01:07:22.104
Nipply.

01:07:28.476 --> 01:07:30.175
<i>What's wrong?</i>

01:07:33.648 --> 01:07:35.251
<i>Holloway?</i>

01:07:36.717 --> 01:07:37.851
I, uh...

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:41.220
I don't feel so good.

01:07:41.222 --> 01:07:43.222
<i>Please expand.</i>

01:07:43.224 --> 01:07:44.757
Nauseous.

01:07:44.759 --> 01:07:45.825
Migraine.

01:07:45.827 --> 01:07:47.659
I got blurry vision.

01:07:47.661 --> 01:07:48.696
Uh...

01:07:50.632 --> 01:07:52.565
Burning.

01:07:52.567 --> 01:07:53.833
Burning all over.

01:07:53.835 --> 01:07:55.235
<i>It's the radiation.</i>

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:57.302
<i>O2, ten percent.</i>

01:07:57.304 --> 01:07:59.639
<i>You need to slow
your aspiration.</i>

01:07:59.641 --> 01:08:01.710
<i>You're gulping the O2 supply.</i>

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:10.652
<i>That's better.</i>

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:13.622
Okay.

01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:19.591
<i>Horizon line is starboard,
moving your way.</i>

01:08:19.594 --> 01:08:23.162
<i>Approximately five minutes
until full exposure.</i>

01:08:23.163 --> 01:08:26.398
<i>If you're exposed,
your suit won't withstand it,</i>

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:27.700
<i>not at this range.</i>

01:08:27.702 --> 01:08:29.669
<i>You'll be cooked alive.</i>

01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:31.837
- <i>Did you hear me?</i>
- I got it.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.839
I can't locate the damage.

01:08:33.841 --> 01:08:35.407
<i>It's above the scrubbers.</i>

01:08:35.408 --> 01:08:37.544
Yeah, I'm on the scrubbers.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:40.580
<i>Well, it's right there.</i>

01:08:40.582 --> 01:08:42.682
- I can't see it.
- <i>What's your position?</i>

01:08:42.684 --> 01:08:43.883
Right on top.

01:08:43.885 --> 01:08:46.255
<i>O2, nine percent.</i>

01:08:47.822 --> 01:08:49.354
<i>You are situated towards</i>

01:08:49.356 --> 01:08:51.624
<i>the front of the capsule?</i>

01:08:51.626 --> 01:08:53.425
Negative, no.
The scrubbers are central.

01:08:53.426 --> 01:08:55.194
<i>Not on the Khapera modules.</i>

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:58.497
<i>The CO2 assemblies are situated
towards the nose.</i>

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.469
Shit. I remember.

01:09:02.604 --> 01:09:03.706
<i>It's an old design.</i>

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:10.446
<i>The biology's changed
quite a bit.</i>

01:09:15.817 --> 01:09:18.884
I forgot I was aboard
an antique.

01:09:18.886 --> 01:09:21.453
Damn thing's probably older
than the asteroids.

01:09:21.456 --> 01:09:23.755
<i>O2, eight percent.</i>

01:09:23.756 --> 01:09:26.662
<i>Okay, we're losing time. Fast.</i>

01:09:29.997 --> 01:09:32.764
- I found it.
- <i>Thank God for that.</i>

01:09:32.765 --> 01:09:34.433
<i>What's the extent
of the damage?</i>

01:09:34.435 --> 01:09:36.001
<i>Fixable in five minutes?</i>

01:09:36.002 --> 01:09:37.803
Is that rhetorical?

01:09:39.939 --> 01:09:41.473
Roberts?

01:09:44.511 --> 01:09:45.877
Roberts?

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:49.014
Roberts, repeat.

01:09:49.015 --> 01:09:50.750
<i>You have just under
four minutes</i>

01:09:50.752 --> 01:09:52.919
<i>before that area is exposed.</i>

01:09:52.921 --> 01:09:56.421
Copy that. Four minutes.
Plenty of time.

01:09:57.891 --> 01:10:00.326
Wilco. Copy that.

01:10:00.328 --> 01:10:02.498
<i>O2, seven percent.</i>

01:10:31.859 --> 01:10:34.294
<i>O2, six percent.</i>

01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:38.531
<i>Okay, your breathing
is too fast.</i>

01:10:38.533 --> 01:10:39.632
I know, I know.

01:10:39.634 --> 01:10:40.700
<i>Slow it down.</i>

01:10:40.702 --> 01:10:44.370
Whew. It's... damn hot.

01:10:44.372 --> 01:10:46.442
<i>Keep it under control.</i>

01:10:50.478 --> 01:10:52.611
How's contact with
Control coming?

01:10:52.613 --> 01:10:54.282
<i>Nearly there.</i>

01:11:01.389 --> 01:11:05.391
Is there more debris incoming?
More wreckage?

01:11:05.393 --> 01:11:07.860
<i>There was a series
of further explosions</i>

01:11:07.862 --> 01:11:11.531
<i>from the asteroid station,
following your departure.</i>

01:11:11.533 --> 01:11:13.700
<i>Each blast must have thrown
further shrapnel clusters</i>

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:15.271
<i>in our direction.</i>

01:11:31.051 --> 01:11:33.655
Looks like it's gonna rain.

01:11:43.497 --> 01:11:45.865
<i>O2, five percent.</i>

01:11:45.867 --> 01:11:47.967
<i>You're doing good.
Hang in there.</i>

01:11:47.969 --> 01:11:50.803
You know, after this,
I feel like a vacation.

01:11:50.805 --> 01:11:51.870
<i>Preferences?</i>

01:11:51.872 --> 01:11:54.607
Uh, nowhere warm.

01:11:54.609 --> 01:11:56.709
<i>Alaska?</i>

01:11:56.711 --> 01:11:58.947
Alaska sounds good.

01:12:01.783 --> 01:12:03.616
<i>O2, four percent.</i>

01:12:03.618 --> 01:12:05.651
<i>How about Barrow?</i>

01:12:05.653 --> 01:12:07.789
<i>They're currently having
a polar night.</i>

01:12:10.057 --> 01:12:12.023
Sounds perfect.

01:12:12.025 --> 01:12:13.659
Ah, shit!

01:12:13.661 --> 01:12:15.628
<i>Damage to outer shell

01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:18.830

01:12:18.832 --> 01:12:22.101

<i>Holloway, you've got to hurry.</i>

01:12:57.671 --> 01:13:00.505

Roberts, has the O2 in the tank
been stabilized?
