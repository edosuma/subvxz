WEBVTT

00:02.042 --> 00:03.708
-NARRATOR: Tonight...
-MATTY: Let's get in that water.

00:03.875 --> 00:05.458
NARRATOR:
...on <i>Beyond Oak Island...</i>

00:05.542 --> 00:07.500
There's $400 million dollars'
worth of Civil War gold

00:07.667 --> 00:10.292
-somewhere
around Poverty Island.
-Heck yes.

00:10.375 --> 00:12.667
We've taken treasure hunting
to new heights!

00:12.792 --> 00:14.167
-There it is.
-MATTY: Wow!

00:14.292 --> 00:16.875
RICK:
If we can definitively say

00:17.042 --> 00:19.250
that's the <i>Lawrence,</i>
that's the key.

00:21.750 --> 00:22.708
Copy that.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.208
Did you say a large chest?

00:30.417 --> 00:32.208
All the while
we were growing up,

00:32.333 --> 00:35.542
my brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:36.708 --> 00:37.583
RICK:
Pirate treasure,

00:37.708 --> 00:39.333
cursed treasure.

00:39.458 --> 00:41.125
Civil War gold.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.042
-(laughter)
-Since then,
our work on Oak Island

00:44.167 --> 00:46.167
has shown us
there's a world of mysteries...

00:46.292 --> 00:49.250
-Whoa.
-...waiting to be explored.

00:49.375 --> 00:52.125
RICK:
So, we like to reach out
to other treasure hunters.

00:52.208 --> 00:54.417
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:54.542 --> 00:56.583
-MARTY: We want to hear
their stories...
-That's right.

00:56.708 --> 00:59.167
-...and share our insights.
-"Ill-gotten gains."

00:59.250 --> 01:00.583
-RICK: And who knows...
-GARY: I got it.

01:00.708 --> 01:02.542
...maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:02.708 --> 01:04.125
MARTY:
Not only in America.

01:04.208 --> 01:05.875
Wow. That is gold.

01:06.042 --> 01:07.792
-RICK: But all over the world.
-Yeah!

01:07.917 --> 01:09.542
MARTY:
<i>Beyond Oak Island.</i>

01:17.292 --> 01:18.958
MATTY:
Well, Rick,

01:19.042 --> 01:20.375
it's good to be on
your home turf, my friend.

01:20.542 --> 01:22.667
It is indeed, Matty.
Marty and I

01:22.792 --> 01:24.167
were born, bred,
and raised here.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.500
-Yeah!
-And, at some point,

01:26.583 --> 01:27.625
you will become an honorary
Yooper.

01:27.708 --> 01:28.917
MATTY:
Yes!

01:29.042 --> 01:31.500
NARRATOR:
In the city of Escanaba,

01:31.625 --> 01:34.000
located in
Michigan's Upper Peninsula,

01:34.167 --> 01:36.083
Rick Lagina and Matty Blake

01:36.208 --> 01:38.958
are heading to
the Delta County Airport

01:39.083 --> 01:40.833
to meet with Mike
and Jess Groleau.

01:42.583 --> 01:44.833
They are a husband and wife
team of treasure hunters

01:44.958 --> 01:48.583
who claim to have uncovered
new and surprising information

01:48.708 --> 01:52.333
surrounding a long-lost shipment
of Civil War-era gold

01:52.500 --> 01:53.833
that is believed
to lie somewhere

01:53.958 --> 01:55.250
at the bottom of Lake Michigan,

01:55.375 --> 01:59.250
near the shores of
the area's famed Poverty Island.

01:59.375 --> 02:01.667
MATTY:
This story alone,

02:01.833 --> 02:04.083
the estimates are there's
$400 million dollars' worth

02:04.208 --> 02:07.500
of Civil War gold
still in Lake Michigan,

02:07.667 --> 02:10.083
-somewhere around
Poverty Island.
-Yep.

02:11.208 --> 02:13.333
NARRATOR:
In 1863,

02:13.417 --> 02:16.500
at the height of
the American Civil War,

02:16.583 --> 02:19.333
the Union Navy's blockade
of Southern seaports

02:19.458 --> 02:22.208
had cut off Confederate
shipments of cotton to Europe,

02:22.375 --> 02:24.333
devastating the French economy.

02:24.458 --> 02:29.625
In response, France's emperor
Napoleon Bonaparte III,

02:29.708 --> 02:32.958
nephew of Napoleon I,
reportedly came up

02:33.083 --> 02:35.167
with a daring plan to smuggle

02:35.250 --> 02:37.500
over $4.5 million dollars'
worth of gold

02:37.583 --> 02:39.333
into the hands
of the Confederacy

02:39.417 --> 02:41.042
to help them win the war.

02:41.167 --> 02:42.708
In the early days,

02:42.833 --> 02:44.833
the Great Lakes were highways.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.833
They were water-based highways.

02:46.958 --> 02:49.500
Europeans came through

02:49.625 --> 02:52.458
what we know today
as the St. Lawrence Seaway,

02:52.542 --> 02:56.167
a passageway leading
from the Atlantic Ocean

02:56.292 --> 02:58.292
into Lake Ontario.

02:58.417 --> 03:00.375
And then that connects
to Lake Erie

03:00.542 --> 03:03.500
and Huron
and Superior and Michigan.

03:03.625 --> 03:06.458
So, this was truly
a highway system.

03:06.542 --> 03:09.000
NARRATOR:
But when the ship
carrying the gold

03:09.125 --> 03:10.583
made its way onto Lake Michigan,

03:10.708 --> 03:13.250
it was spotted
by a Union vessel,

03:13.375 --> 03:15.292
which then began to give chase.

03:15.417 --> 03:18.375
Fearful of being overtaken

03:18.542 --> 03:21.125
and having this valuable
shipment fall into enemy hands,

03:21.250 --> 03:22.750
the French captain gave an order

03:22.875 --> 03:25.833
for the boxes of gold
to be chained together

03:26.000 --> 03:27.792
and thrown overboard.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.333
WESTRICK:
The reason you'd chain
all these boxes together

03:29.417 --> 03:31.375
would be to retrieve them later.

03:31.542 --> 03:34.167
If it's chained together, you're
gonna be able to drag a hook,

03:34.333 --> 03:35.958
grappling anchor
through the area

03:36.083 --> 03:37.542
and snag it and retrieve them.

03:37.667 --> 03:40.458
NARRATOR:
However, according to legend,

03:40.542 --> 03:43.292
the French ship was sunk
shortly after

03:43.375 --> 03:46.333
scuttling its cargo,
and both it and the gold

03:46.500 --> 03:49.500
were lost beneath
the waters of Lake Michigan.

03:49.667 --> 03:54.667
Until, as some accounts state,
the year 1933,

03:54.833 --> 03:58.333
when a Milwaukee-based treasure
hunter named Wilfred Behrens,

03:58.417 --> 04:01.042
leading a search operation
aboard his ship

04:01.167 --> 04:03.292
the <i>Captain Lawrence,</i>

04:03.375 --> 04:05.000
reportedly located
the sunken chests

04:05.167 --> 04:08.000
using a diving bell drag line

04:08.125 --> 04:09.792
just offshore
from Poverty Island.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.958
The operation was witnessed
by an 11-year-old

04:13.042 --> 04:17.542
named Karly Jessen, the son of
the island's lighthouse keeper.

04:17.667 --> 04:21.167
WESTRICK:
The young son would
sit on the shore watching

04:21.250 --> 04:22.917
the <i>Captain Lawrence,</i>
watching the diving bell,

04:23.042 --> 04:25.042
watching the operations,

04:25.167 --> 04:27.333
and something unusual
happened on board.

04:27.458 --> 04:29.167
They were out there
hooting and hollering.

04:29.292 --> 04:31.042
The lighthouse keeper's son,

04:31.208 --> 04:32.833
he thought they had
discovered something.

04:32.958 --> 04:36.458
NARRATOR:
But just after
Wilfred Behrens and his crew

04:36.583 --> 04:38.917
were reported to have made
their astonishing discovery,

04:39.042 --> 04:40.958
a violent storm rolled in.

04:41.042 --> 04:43.292
Both the <i>Captain Lawrence</i>

04:43.417 --> 04:45.667
and anything it may have
taken on board

04:45.792 --> 04:48.500
were quickly lost
beneath the waves.

04:50.542 --> 04:52.417
RICK:
I think there's reason
to be very hopeful.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.542
I'm so glad I'm getting
another crack at this,

04:55.708 --> 04:57.875
'cause two previous attempts
with your brother

04:58.000 --> 05:01.250
and Bob Kreipke, who is super
passionate about this mystery.

05:01.375 --> 05:04.000
We checked the north side,
we checked the south side

05:04.125 --> 05:06.250
and we got some
intriguing results.

05:07.167 --> 05:08.458
LUKE:
It's one hundred percent,

05:08.583 --> 05:10.333
that's old shipwreck material.

05:10.458 --> 05:12.583
NARRATOR:
During the past two years,

05:12.708 --> 05:16.542
Rick Lagina's brother Marty,
along with Matty Blake,

05:16.708 --> 05:19.500
have explored
the Poverty Island area

05:19.625 --> 05:22.000
with local treasure hunter
Bob Kreipke as he attempted

05:22.167 --> 05:23.500
to locate
the underwater wreckage

05:23.583 --> 05:25.167
of the <i>Captain Lawrence.</i>

05:25.250 --> 05:28.042
Well, he can't
bring it up though, can he?

05:28.208 --> 05:29.500
NARRATOR:
But despite uncovering

05:29.583 --> 05:31.583
some very promising clues,

05:31.708 --> 05:34.083
finding the remains of
the lost ship,

05:34.208 --> 05:36.042
and its potential
treasure cache,

05:36.167 --> 05:38.292
has remained an elusive target.

05:38.417 --> 05:39.792
I believe they're right here.

05:39.917 --> 05:41.500
-There they are, right there.
-Is that them?

05:41.667 --> 05:43.333
-Yeah, that's them.
-Okay, I'll park here, then.

05:43.417 --> 05:44.625
RICK:
We're trying to unravel
a mystery,

05:44.750 --> 05:46.708
a really cool one,
and what's even

05:46.833 --> 05:49.333
better for me is
my brother had a go at this,

05:49.458 --> 05:51.125
and now I have a go at this.

05:51.208 --> 05:54.458
Any maybe together we can put
this mystery to bed, at least.

05:55.208 --> 05:56.583
-Mike, Jess!
-How are you, Rick?

05:56.708 --> 05:58.958
-How are you?
-Good, how are you doing?

05:59.083 --> 06:01.833
My name is Mike Groleau.
I'm from Escanaba, Michigan.

06:01.958 --> 06:05.083
I am a detective for the
Delta County Sherriff's office.

06:05.208 --> 06:07.458
And this is my wife,
Jess Groleau.

06:07.542 --> 06:10.333
We've been together
about seven years now.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.208
Over the course of about
ten years, I was involved

06:13.375 --> 06:16.250
with an organization that
provided rescue services

06:16.375 --> 06:18.625
on the Great Lakes for
other vessels in distress.

06:18.750 --> 06:21.500
So I was in that area a lot

06:21.625 --> 06:24.333
and I had heard
the Poverty Island gold story...

06:24.500 --> 06:27.458
JESS:
I love history and researching,

06:27.542 --> 06:30.667
and so what drew me
to the Poverty Island mystery

06:30.750 --> 06:33.000
is the rich history
of the Great Lakes.

06:33.125 --> 06:36.750
There's all this history
that people don't even know.

06:36.875 --> 06:39.042
It's personal to us
because we live here.

06:39.167 --> 06:40.667
You know, it's a U.P. thing.

06:40.833 --> 06:43.833
I love that, that it's all
right in our backyard.

06:43.958 --> 06:46.500
MATTY:
I would love to hear
what you guys

06:46.625 --> 06:49.000
are thinking, what you've
learned and what the plan is.

06:49.125 --> 06:51.750
Well, let's head inside
and we'll talk about it.

06:51.875 --> 06:53.708
-All right, perfect, love it.
-See where we go.
-RICK: Lead on.

06:53.875 --> 06:56.833
GROLEAU: What draws me to
the Poverty Island story

06:56.917 --> 06:59.292
is the lack of good
documentation around it

06:59.375 --> 07:01.667
and I love to explore
a little bit more

07:01.792 --> 07:04.333
and then discover something

07:04.417 --> 07:07.333
and find out...
what's the story behind that?

07:07.417 --> 07:10.125
So, kind of chasing down
the different leads

07:10.250 --> 07:12.083
and trying to
figure it out is awesome.

07:12.208 --> 07:15.208
I love that stuff, too,
so one thing led to another.

07:15.333 --> 07:19.458
I found all these breadcrumbs
and it just, it captivated me.

07:19.583 --> 07:22.167
So what is some of
the research that you've...

07:22.292 --> 07:23.708
you've come up with?

07:23.875 --> 07:28.542
I started just,
you know, searching

07:28.667 --> 07:31.375
the Library of Congress
for Poverty Island,

07:31.500 --> 07:33.667
and then, lo and behold,
there was a lot more

07:33.792 --> 07:36.250
than I could have ever imagined.

07:36.375 --> 07:38.500
Did the captain of
the <i>Lawrence</i> ever--

07:38.667 --> 07:40.500
Was there any documentation

07:40.667 --> 07:43.042
in terms of how the ship went
down or anything like that?

07:43.208 --> 07:46.792
Yes, there's actually dated
records to the specifics

07:46.875 --> 07:50.250
of the time:
3:00 a.m., September 19,

07:50.375 --> 07:51.917
-1933, like...
-Wow.

07:52.042 --> 07:57.667
It's all, it's all dated,
documented, everything in--

07:57.750 --> 08:00.250
The captain of the <i>Captain
Lawrence</i> is Wilfred Behrens.

08:00.375 --> 08:02.083
MATTY:
Wilfred Behrens.

08:02.208 --> 08:03.625
JESS:
Behrens, yes.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.833
And so he sent out
a distress call?

08:05.958 --> 08:09.458
Or did he just notify and say
"I've encountered a storm"?

08:09.583 --> 08:11.000
The captain of
the <i>Captain Lawrence</i>

08:11.083 --> 08:14.250
did deny assistance
from the Coast Guard.

08:14.375 --> 08:16.333
-Really?
-Yes.

08:16.458 --> 08:18.958
Why would the <i>Lawrence...</i>

08:19.083 --> 08:21.500
When she foundered,

08:21.625 --> 08:23.083
why wouldn't she have
asked for help?

08:23.208 --> 08:24.500
JESS:
If there was gold,

08:24.625 --> 08:27.292
you don't want to tell
a lot of people.

08:27.375 --> 08:28.750
Now that's interesting.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.667
So do you guys believe,
sitting here,

08:30.750 --> 08:32.917
that if you find the <i>Lawrence,</i>
you find the treasure,

08:33.042 --> 08:34.375
'cause that's kind of
been the thought.

08:34.542 --> 08:36.000
I think they're gonna be
one and the same.

08:36.125 --> 08:38.625
If you find the <i>Lawrence,</i> you
can confirm it's the <i>Lawrence,</i>

08:38.708 --> 08:41.917
you know,
within a hundred-foot radius,

08:42.042 --> 08:43.125
you know,
we should find a chain,

08:43.208 --> 08:44.833
maybe leading to a chest?

08:44.958 --> 08:47.458
Do you guys-- I mean,
we're sitting here today,

08:47.583 --> 08:49.500
do you have a target in mind?

08:49.583 --> 08:52.250
I've got an image here
to show you.

08:52.375 --> 08:53.375
-Poverty Island.
-MATTY: Yup.

08:53.542 --> 08:55.875
-You guys searched here.
-Yup.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.042
GROLEAU:
Then you searched down here
on the south side.

08:58.167 --> 08:59.750
-MATTY: Yup.
-So this is going to be over

08:59.875 --> 09:01.833
on the west side of the island,

09:01.958 --> 09:05.375
which is still
within view of the lighthouse,

09:05.542 --> 09:08.125
and the proposed search location

09:08.250 --> 09:10.667
is going to be right here
where this red dot is.

09:10.833 --> 09:13.667
So that's going to give us
kind of a fresh look at things

09:13.833 --> 09:16.292
and explore something that maybe
hasn't been explored before.

09:16.375 --> 09:20.375
I-I'm just curious, from a...
I'm not a seafaring person,

09:20.500 --> 09:23.458
but if you were in trouble...

09:23.583 --> 09:26.500
is that where
you would seek refuge?

09:26.667 --> 09:28.792
So, if the wind was
out of the east,

09:28.917 --> 09:30.917
common sense would say we'd want

09:31.042 --> 09:33.583
to get on the southwestern side
of the island,

09:33.708 --> 09:35.333
but in doing so,

09:35.417 --> 09:37.333
you put yourself
at a bigger risk,

09:37.500 --> 09:39.833
um, not knowing the area, maybe,

09:39.917 --> 09:41.667
and the waves build
in that area,

09:41.750 --> 09:44.333
'cause it's so much more
shallow in that area.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.500
Big waves,
they get shallower water,

09:46.625 --> 09:48.458
they get steeper
and they curl over,

09:48.583 --> 09:50.917
and that'll overtake
a ship easily.

09:51.042 --> 09:53.833
And in your time working,
like, in that area

09:53.958 --> 09:55.542
in the rescue services
and all that,

09:55.708 --> 09:58.500
did you hear rumors
about wrecks in that area?

09:58.583 --> 10:00.583
GROLEAU:
We did. Uh...

10:00.708 --> 10:02.667
It was local lore that,

10:02.792 --> 10:04.792
maybe, possibly, the <i>Captain
Lawrence</i> could be there.

10:04.917 --> 10:07.833
Wow. all right so you have
a target, this is exciting.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.792
So, based on
all this information,

10:10.917 --> 10:12.833
based on all the tips,
based on our research,

10:12.958 --> 10:14.708
what I've arranged for us today,

10:14.875 --> 10:16.833
we've chartered
a plane out of Iron Mountain,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.583
and we're going to run out
there, get on board,

10:19.708 --> 10:21.625
and go up in the air
and take a look.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.583
And the thought would be
we might see something?

10:23.708 --> 10:25.333
The thought would be
we might see something

10:25.500 --> 10:27.875
and it's always great to have
a different perspective

10:28.042 --> 10:29.792
-on something, as well.
-MATTY: Sure.

10:29.875 --> 10:32.458
Well, I say, let's get up in the
air, let's go find it!

Common sense would say
we need to dive

11:49.500 --> 11:50.958
to look for the treasure.

11:51.042 --> 11:52.625
But the clues might be
up there in the sky,

So, what we're looking for is

a shape, you know,
of a hull that's up there.

are we get out here on a boat.

14:23.125 --> 14:25.000
We use our side-scan sonar.

14:25.083 --> 14:27.167
See what's actually down there

14:27.333 --> 14:29.458
beneath that wreck
where it's deeper,

14:29.583 --> 14:31.375
where we can't see from the air.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.333
And then, hopefully,
identify some targets to dive.

14:33.417 --> 14:36.375
MATTY:
Right now, I want to land,
you know, because

14:36.500 --> 14:38.500
I've seen it from above,
let's see it below.

14:38.667 --> 14:41.750
We can get imaging and then
if the imaging is promising,

14:41.875 --> 14:43.667
as promising
as it was from the air,

14:43.833 --> 14:45.458
we can talk about a dive plan.

14:45.542 --> 14:47.958
So do you have people
that you're in touch with

14:48.042 --> 14:49.333
that could do a side scan?

14:49.417 --> 14:51.167
-A friend of ours, Todd Berg.
-Okay.

14:51.250 --> 14:52.667
He'll get us a side scan
all set up and ready

14:52.833 --> 14:54.167
to go on the boat.

14:54.292 --> 14:56.667
If we can definitively say,

14:56.750 --> 14:57.958
"That's the <i>Lawrence,"</i>

14:58.083 --> 14:59.375
that would be huge.

15:41.542 --> 15:44.000
back out to the coast
off Poverty Island,

15:44.125 --> 15:47.292

pinpoint a more exact location

15:47.375 --> 15:49.042

15:49.208 --> 15:50.333
earlier this morning,

15:50.500 --> 15:51.875

in preparation for
a potential dive operation.

15:57.708 --> 16:00.792
GROLEAU:
I took a mental reference
when we were in the airplane

16:00.875 --> 16:01.917
and we were doing our orbits

16:02.042 --> 16:03.417
off that area on shore.

16:03.542 --> 16:05.708
So, the first thing we did

All right, Mike,

16:09.250 --> 16:10.250
are we on the spot, you think?

16:10.375 --> 16:11.375
I think we're pretty close,

16:11.542 --> 16:13.083
so this is right where

16:13.208 --> 16:15.167
we were flying over,
where we saw the ship come up.

16:15.292 --> 16:16.750

Today,

16:33.708 --> 16:35.583
the team will be using

16:35.708 --> 16:40.917
the Garmin ECHOMAP UHD
93SV side-scan sonar device.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.917
As the team's search vessel
moves back and forth

16:44.042 --> 16:46.417
in a grid pattern
across the lake's surface,

16:46.542 --> 16:49.375
the device will emit
pulses of sound waves

16:49.542 --> 16:52.250
pointed down
toward the lake bottom.

16:52.375 --> 16:55.667
The acoustic reflections
that are subsequently generated

16:55.792 --> 16:59.167
help to form three-dimensional
images of any objects

16:59.250 --> 17:02.667
or structures
that might be located below.

17:04.083 --> 17:06.333
MATTY:
What are some little tells
that you see sometimes where

17:06.417 --> 17:07.500
there's something, you go,
"Okay, that's clearly...":

17:07.625 --> 17:08.875
You know, do you see like,

17:09.042 --> 17:10.000
raised feature
or something like that

17:10.083 --> 17:11.625
-when you know?
-Yeah, especially

17:11.750 --> 17:13.000
if you go right over,
because you'll see it

17:13.125 --> 17:14.042
on both sides in the black area.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.083
Right, right.

17:16.208 --> 17:17.583
GROLEAU:
A lot of times you see
shadows, too,

17:17.708 --> 17:18.667
the taller the object,

17:18.833 --> 17:20.333
you'll see a shadow.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.125
-It'll be casting a shadow?
-Yeah, exactly.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.500
Just like shining
a light on something.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.583
MATTY:
Sure.

What do we got there?

17:33.167 --> 17:34.583

-Holy moly.
-Yeah.

17:49.667 --> 17:52.333

And what do we know about
the dimensions of that boat?

17:53.250 --> 17:55.333
-It's in the ballpark, yeah.
-All right, good.

the ballpark, that's a wreck.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.875

-GROLEAU: That's pronounced.
-MATTY: Yeah.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.167

18:09.250 --> 18:11.083
JESS:
What is that?

18:15.167 --> 18:17.500
-JESS: What's that?

18:21.458 --> 18:23.333
just off the coast
of Poverty Island,

18:23.417 --> 18:26.375
while investigating
a shipwreck believed

18:26.542 --> 18:30.667
to possibly contain $400 million
in lost Civil War gold,

18:30.833 --> 18:32.750
Rick Lagina and the team

18:32.875 --> 18:35.333
have just made what could be
a surprising discovery.

18:35.458 --> 18:37.792
I haven't seen that before.

18:39.375 --> 18:40.667
GROLEAU:
We got something else there,

18:40.750 --> 18:42.000
possibly two wrecks.

18:42.083 --> 18:43.292
One across the top of another.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.667
It does, it looks like two.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.083
MATTY:
Right now, I'm following
the imaging on the screen,

18:48.208 --> 18:50.292
and we see what clearly
could be a ship

18:50.375 --> 18:51.333
and then, all of a sudden,

18:51.458 --> 18:53.333
we all kind of realize

18:53.458 --> 18:55.250
that there could be two.

18:55.375 --> 18:59.333
GROLEAU:
So we got one shipwreck this way
and another one

18:59.458 --> 19:01.333
-laying across it.
-MATTY: Holy moly.

19:01.417 --> 19:03.375
-So you got one here...
-Wow!

19:03.542 --> 19:05.125
...and the other one across it.

19:06.667 --> 19:09.000
RICK:
And that would fit
the story, right?

19:09.167 --> 19:10.917
It definitely fits the story.

19:11.042 --> 19:12.208
MATTY:
(claps) Come on!

19:12.375 --> 19:14.708
-Come on, this is great!
-Well done.

19:14.833 --> 19:18.375
MATTY:
This is one of those
awesome times when what

19:18.500 --> 19:20.583
you're finding fits the story.

19:20.708 --> 19:23.958
And the story here is
that a ship sank

19:24.083 --> 19:27.167
after they jettisoned
Civil War gold

19:27.250 --> 19:28.917
into Lake Michigan.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.083
Another ship,
at a later date, came,

19:31.208 --> 19:33.500
possibly found some of
that gold, but then sank.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.458
And so, we are finding
evidence of two ships.

19:36.542 --> 19:39.417
One looks like it could possibly
be on top of the other.

19:39.542 --> 19:41.917
That fits the story,
so that's exciting.

19:42.042 --> 19:43.917
That's two ships.

19:44.042 --> 19:47.708
And if one went down,
and there was already one down,

19:47.833 --> 19:50.250
it would pretty much, could look
like that right, Mike?

19:50.375 --> 19:52.167
That's what I would
expect it to look like.

19:52.333 --> 19:54.292
-I love it.
-That's awesome.

19:54.375 --> 19:56.292
How you feeling,
Jess, right now?

19:56.417 --> 19:58.500
Pretty awesome. I'm, like,
I'm speechless, for once.

19:58.667 --> 20:00.167
MATTY:
Your hard work's paying off.

20:00.292 --> 20:01.833
You know what I mean?
You're telling the story.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.208
And it's emerging right before
our eyes, it's incredible.

20:04.333 --> 20:07.000
All right, so,
I mean, we've seen it

20:07.083 --> 20:08.667
from it from the air.
(chuckles)

20:08.833 --> 20:11.208
We've seen it with our eyes,
we've see it on this imaging.

20:11.333 --> 20:13.083
Great job, guys.
So, next step is what?

20:13.208 --> 20:14.708
Let's get in and dive it.

20:14.833 --> 20:16.833
Look, I think this is
a great day, Rick.

20:16.958 --> 20:19.167
It was better than a great day,
as far as I'm concerned.

20:19.333 --> 20:21.333
Whenever you can take

20:21.458 --> 20:24.292
your analytics and overlay it

20:24.417 --> 20:27.375
onto the historical narrative,
you've... you've...

20:27.500 --> 20:30.000
you've moved the dial,
and the next way

20:30.167 --> 20:32.083
to move the dial is what Mike is
saying, you gotta get wet,

20:32.208 --> 20:34.458
-right?
-You gotta get wet.

20:34.542 --> 20:36.583
Well, it's getting late, so
let's get that dive plan going

20:36.708 --> 20:38.500
and get back out here tomorrow
morning and just get at it.

20:38.625 --> 20:41.417
-All right.
-Great day!

20:42.333 --> 20:43.917
RICK:
It's been a great day.

20:48.167 --> 20:49.292
NARRATOR:
The next morning...

20:49.417 --> 20:50.583
MATTY:
Let's get in that water.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.667
NARRATOR:
...Mike and Jess Groleau,

20:52.792 --> 20:55.708
along with Rick Lagina
and Matty Blake,

20:55.875 --> 20:58.500
return to the waters just off
the coast of Poverty Island

20:58.583 --> 21:01.333
to begin their
underwater dive operation.

21:01.458 --> 21:04.417
Do we have any zip ties?

21:04.542 --> 21:06.500
NARRATOR:
Joining them is
the Groleaus' friend,

21:06.625 --> 21:08.792
diving expert Jon Smith.

21:08.875 --> 21:11.708
I have dove with him many,
many times in the past,

21:11.833 --> 21:15.542
and we share a mutual interest
for the Poverty Island gold.

21:15.667 --> 21:18.458
NARRATOR:
He will be helping the team

21:18.583 --> 21:20.458
to hopefully find
and confirm the existence

21:20.542 --> 21:24.000
of two shipwrecks
identified during yesterday's

21:24.167 --> 21:25.833
side-scan sonar search.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.000
JON:
Okay, you ready?

21:27.125 --> 21:28.167
GROLEAU:
So the first dive

21:28.250 --> 21:30.833
is a reconnaissance dive.

21:30.958 --> 21:32.375
We're looking for

21:32.542 --> 21:34.250
a second wreck.

21:34.375 --> 21:35.958
Um, we're looking
for that second shipwreck

21:36.083 --> 21:38.833
that's across the top of
the older, bigger shipwreck.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.792
If we do find something,

21:40.917 --> 21:43.000
we need to approach the state
and get a permit

21:43.125 --> 21:44.375
to bring it up.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.042
MATTY:
Okay, divers are ready?

21:51.375 --> 21:53.958
Divers are down.

22:04.667 --> 22:06.583
MATTY:
Hey, Mike, it's Matty
at the surface.

22:06.708 --> 22:07.792
Just want to see how
you guys are doing

22:07.875 --> 22:08.833
down there. Over.

22:18.208 --> 22:19.583
Do you have eyes on the target?

22:25.625 --> 22:27.750
♪ ♪

22:44.625 --> 22:46.292
Mike, just confirming,

22:46.417 --> 22:48.375
so you're seeing something?
Over.

22:59.792 --> 23:02.375
MATTY:
Unbelievable, that's great.

23:16.667 --> 23:18.667
-They're over that shallow...
-JESS: The shallow one,

23:18.750 --> 23:20.625
-so the first ship.
-MATTY: The one we could see.

23:20.750 --> 23:23.000
It looks like he said
it's pretty broken up.

23:24.167 --> 23:28.292
GROLEAU:
What it looks like to me is
maybe the ship went down,

23:28.375 --> 23:31.167
and because it was
in such a shallow area,

23:31.250 --> 23:32.750
right off the big lake,

23:32.875 --> 23:35.250
waves came in,
busted up the wreck.

23:35.375 --> 23:37.625
I mean it looks like
a tornado, ya know,

23:37.708 --> 23:39.083
stuff was rolling down
down there

23:39.208 --> 23:41.417
and it's,
it's a huge debris field.

23:59.625 --> 24:01.042
MATTY:
Mike, I'm just confirming.

24:01.167 --> 24:02.500
Ballast rock?

24:02.625 --> 24:04.625
You think you see ballast rock?
Over.

24:10.375 --> 24:11.958
MATTY:
Well, that would be cool.

24:12.042 --> 24:14.792
If we have ballast stones
down there near the wreck.

24:15.625 --> 24:17.792
NARRATOR:
Ballast stones?

24:17.917 --> 24:20.208
Lying adjacent
to the wooden remains of

24:20.375 --> 24:22.000
a shipwreck on the lake floor?

24:23.583 --> 24:26.375
During the 18th
and 19th centuries,

24:26.542 --> 24:28.875
ballast stones were
commonly placed

24:29.042 --> 24:31.125
in the hulls of
large sailing vessels

24:31.208 --> 24:33.958
to offer additional
weight and stability to ships

24:34.083 --> 24:37.500
as they traveled over
rough or unstable waters.

24:37.667 --> 24:39.958
Could these
ballast stones suggest

24:40.042 --> 24:42.583
that the shipwreck
the team has just found

24:42.708 --> 24:45.458
might date as far back
as the Civil War?

24:46.500 --> 24:48.458
If so, might it be the ship

24:48.542 --> 24:50.833
that once carried
the lost cache of gold

24:50.958 --> 24:52.667
that the <i>Captain Lawrence</i>
and its crew

24:52.833 --> 24:56.458
were reported
to have found in 1933,

24:56.583 --> 24:59.750
before also sinking
to the bottom of the lake?

24:59.875 --> 25:02.167
The ballast stones are key
in a lot of ways,

25:02.292 --> 25:03.667
because, first of all,
it narrows

25:03.750 --> 25:05.667
what kind of ship
it could be,

25:05.792 --> 25:09.167
and when that ship was sailing.

25:32.208 --> 25:33.042
MATTY:
Oh, Rick!

25:43.292 --> 25:44.208
MATTY:
So there's two ships.

25:44.333 --> 25:45.250
They crisscross.

25:45.375 --> 25:46.875
RICK:
That's good news.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.500
NARRATOR:
Just off the shores

25:48.583 --> 25:49.792
of Poverty Island,

25:49.875 --> 25:52.625
treasure hunter Mike Groleau

25:52.750 --> 25:55.833
has just alerted Rick Lagina
and Matty Blake

25:55.917 --> 25:58.167
that he has come across
a second unidentified shipwreck

25:58.333 --> 26:00.208
at the bottom of
Lake Michigan.

26:00.375 --> 26:01.333
MATTY:
That's great news, fellas.

26:01.500 --> 26:02.583
Two ships is good.

26:02.708 --> 26:03.833
Great work, keep going.

26:03.958 --> 26:05.583
NARRATOR:
The team is hoping

26:05.708 --> 26:07.958
that this could be
the <i>Captain Lawrence,</i>

26:08.042 --> 26:12.042
the legendary salvage vessel
that was lost in 1933

26:12.167 --> 26:14.583
after it was believed
to have recovered

26:14.708 --> 26:18.458
nearly $400 million
in lost Civil War gold

26:18.542 --> 26:21.000
from another shipwreck,
before it too sank

26:21.125 --> 26:23.958
into the lake's
treacherous waters.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.167
GROLEAU:
I think it's the <i>Lawrence,</i>

26:29.292 --> 26:30.917
because it fits the story,

26:31.042 --> 26:34.208
and we go back to the lighthouse
keeper's son again.

26:34.375 --> 26:37.625
He could see that area we were
diving from the lighthouse,

26:37.708 --> 26:39.500
and without binoculars,

26:39.625 --> 26:41.417
and be able to see
what they actually pulled up

26:41.542 --> 26:43.083
was a chain and a chest.

26:46.958 --> 26:49.917
GROLEAU: And that second wreck
across the top of

26:50.042 --> 26:53.125
the one they were there
to salvage makes sense.

26:59.458 --> 27:00.667
Ballast with a cable.

27:00.750 --> 27:01.708
Copy that, Mike.

27:01.833 --> 27:03.375
He says he appears to see

27:03.542 --> 27:04.792
a lot of ballast stones
with a cable,

27:04.917 --> 27:06.250
what appears to be
a cable on top.

27:07.458 --> 27:08.917
GROLEAU:
The cable,

27:09.042 --> 27:10.917
I saw a lot of it down there,
and it was a mess.

27:11.042 --> 27:12.625
It was like a bowl of
spaghetti, almost.

27:12.708 --> 27:15.083
And it was over
the entire wreck.

27:15.208 --> 27:17.917
It was over the entire area
surrounding the wreck.

27:18.042 --> 27:20.333
I mean,
it looks rather violent,

27:20.458 --> 27:21.667
like things were...

27:21.792 --> 27:23.375
moving, and storms,

27:23.542 --> 27:25.333
and pushing
and dragging stuff around,

27:25.458 --> 27:28.500
and the cable itself was
two and a half, three inches.

27:28.625 --> 27:30.167
So, that's definitely important.

27:34.792 --> 27:36.792
MATTY:
Copy that.

27:41.125 --> 27:42.500
Copy, Mike,
we'll see you on the surface.

27:42.625 --> 27:43.833
Over.

27:44.875 --> 27:46.542
GROLEAU:
The fact that

27:46.708 --> 27:48.708
we found the old shipwreck,
and then we found

27:48.833 --> 27:51.500
another one that was
completely different

27:51.583 --> 27:53.250
construction
over the top of it,

27:53.375 --> 27:55.875
so we had old versus new,

27:56.042 --> 27:58.083
kind of two different
time periods there,

27:58.208 --> 28:01.167
was kind of a dead giveaway
for me that these are,

28:01.292 --> 28:02.708
one: two different wrecks,

28:02.875 --> 28:04.833
and two: built at
two different times.

28:04.958 --> 28:06.875
So I just kinda
went and explored,

28:07.000 --> 28:11.750
and... and kind of got
a visual map of what it was.

28:11.875 --> 28:15.167
The wreck on top,
is it smaller than the bottom?

28:15.292 --> 28:17.500
So, the second ship is
definitely a smaller ship.

28:17.583 --> 28:19.167
(quietly):
Wow.

28:19.292 --> 28:21.542
And that wire that
you were following,

28:21.667 --> 28:23.583
I mean, could...
any sense of like,

28:23.708 --> 28:24.958
could that have been part of

28:25.042 --> 28:27.125
the <i>Lawrence</i>
salvage effort or...

28:27.208 --> 28:29.750
So, I think it was
most likely that.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.000
-MATTY: Yeah.
-'Cause it wasn't chain.

28:31.125 --> 28:32.250
-Right.
-It was, it was clear cable,

28:32.375 --> 28:33.583
long cable.

28:33.708 --> 28:35.125
And it was, it was big.

28:35.208 --> 28:36.417
MATTY:
Wow.

28:36.542 --> 28:37.833
GROLEAU:
That cable is definitely

28:38.000 --> 28:39.833
something they would use
in an attempt to

28:39.958 --> 28:42.750
salvage a vessel or raise it.

28:42.875 --> 28:44.500
So I was kind of excited,

28:44.583 --> 28:45.750
because we know
that they were

28:45.875 --> 28:47.000
maybe in this area, then,

28:47.125 --> 28:48.417
and we're in the right spot

28:48.542 --> 28:50.083
to continue searching.

28:50.875 --> 28:52.333
-RICK: Good.
-Yeah, it definitely

28:52.500 --> 28:53.792
warrants further
investigation.

28:53.875 --> 28:55.667
There's a lot to see
down there, so...

28:55.833 --> 28:57.583
All right, well,
if you guys are willing, man,

28:57.708 --> 28:59.292
I think this is a great start,

28:59.375 --> 29:03.167
and a second dive is now
mandatory, if you can do it.

29:03.292 --> 29:04.333
-Yeah, absolutely.
-JON: Absolutely.

29:05.292 --> 29:06.833
GROLEAU:
So we're heading
in the water again

29:06.958 --> 29:09.750
to really focus now

29:09.875 --> 29:11.333
on that second wreck
that we found down there,

29:11.500 --> 29:12.708
because we orientated ourselves

29:12.833 --> 29:13.833
on the first dive.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
So, we really want to

29:15.125 --> 29:16.625
measure the keel,
we want to

29:16.750 --> 29:18.625
measure ribs,
the thickness of wood,

29:18.750 --> 29:21.250
how it's constructed,
so that we can

29:21.375 --> 29:23.750
compare that
to something that is known.

29:23.875 --> 29:25.833
You know, hopefully some...

29:25.958 --> 29:26.958
something from the,
the <i>Captain Lawrence.</i>

29:27.083 --> 29:29.042

In the waters of Lake Michigan,

31:33.708 --> 31:35.167
just off the coast

31:35.333 --> 31:39.083
of Poverty Island,
Rick Lagina and Matty Blake

31:39.208 --> 31:41.208
have just been informed of

31:41.333 --> 31:44.333
a potentially astonishing
discovery made by

31:44.500 --> 31:47.125
treasure hunter Mike Groleau
and diver Jon Smith

31:47.250 --> 31:49.917
as they search wreckage
they believe could belong to

31:50.042 --> 31:51.292
the <i>Captain Lawrence,</i>

31:51.375 --> 31:54.833
a salvage vessel
that sank in 1933

31:54.958 --> 31:58.167
after reportedly rescuing
a treasure cache

31:58.292 --> 32:02.458
of lost Civil War gold
worth more than $400 million.

32:02.542 --> 32:06.167
RICK:
When they did mention,
possibly, a chest,

32:06.333 --> 32:08.875
the story is,
it's a treasure wreck.

32:09.042 --> 32:12.125
There's Confederacy gold

32:12.208 --> 32:13.958
in boxes chained together.

32:14.042 --> 32:15.500
You hear chest?

32:15.667 --> 32:17.458
Of course you're going
to pick up your ears.

32:21.000 --> 32:21.917
MATTY:
Copy that.

32:22.042 --> 32:23.625
We have eyes on you guys.

32:23.708 --> 32:24.792
This is it.

32:24.917 --> 32:26.250
This is the moment of truth.

32:26.375 --> 32:27.833
Mike is gonna surface
and tell us

32:27.958 --> 32:29.833
that we're either
still in play here

32:29.917 --> 32:32.375
or "Hey, we found
the <i>Captain Lawrence,</i>

32:32.542 --> 32:34.208
"I found something
with its name on it

32:34.333 --> 32:37.167
or an engraving
or something," or...

32:37.250 --> 32:40.333
this is just
a benign pile of wood,

32:40.500 --> 32:41.708
and we were wrong.

32:41.875 --> 32:43.667
Of course,
I don't want it to be the third.

32:43.750 --> 32:46.375
All right, fellas,
what'd we see?

32:46.500 --> 32:48.167
What did we get?

32:48.333 --> 32:51.000
So, I was looking in every
little nook and cranny I could,

32:51.125 --> 32:53.167
just for, like we say,
little clues

32:53.292 --> 32:55.833
that you're not going
to see in a side-scan

32:55.958 --> 32:57.583
or even if you swim over it.

32:57.708 --> 33:00.917
And I came up to a section
where there was another--

33:01.042 --> 33:02.125
I don't know if
it was part of the hull

33:02.208 --> 33:03.708
or part of another deck--

33:03.875 --> 33:07.333
laying on top of
the hull of our ship.

33:08.417 --> 33:10.542
And I peered in between there,

33:10.708 --> 33:13.083
and I was able to see

33:13.208 --> 33:15.833
two fairly large objects

33:16.000 --> 33:17.375
sitting right
next to each other.

33:17.500 --> 33:20.667
Rectangle on the sides
that came up at an angle,

33:20.750 --> 33:21.958
and they were flat on top.

33:22.083 --> 33:24.833
How big, how big?

33:24.917 --> 33:27.333
GROLEAU:
I would say, boy, um...

33:27.458 --> 33:29.667
-18 inches long?
-Yeah, I'd say close to that.

33:29.833 --> 33:31.708
18 to 24 inches long,

33:31.833 --> 33:34.583
and I would say
at least six wide.

33:35.250 --> 33:36.958
MATTY:
Just the simple fact

33:37.083 --> 33:39.667
that this legend is about
chained boxes of gold,

33:39.792 --> 33:42.208
and you guys are talking
about boxes that are mysterious

33:42.375 --> 33:44.125
and unidentified.
I mean, that's exciting to me.

33:44.250 --> 33:45.500
I'm not saying they are
the boxes, but I'm not saying

33:45.625 --> 33:47.167
they're not, either,
you know what I mean?

33:47.250 --> 33:48.542
Right. It was awesome,
'cause it was like,

33:48.667 --> 33:49.917
"Okay, now we got something.

33:50.042 --> 33:52.125
"Something we can
approach the state with,

33:52.208 --> 33:53.458
-and get a permit."
-MATTY: Yes.

33:54.542 --> 33:56.667
GROLEAU:
So, all these items that
I'm finding down there,

33:56.750 --> 33:58.583
it's really pushing me towards

33:58.708 --> 34:00.917
we do have
the <i>Captain Lawrence</i> here,

34:01.042 --> 34:03.083
and when we do our research,

34:03.208 --> 34:05.333
and we can verify that,

34:05.458 --> 34:07.500
we're gonna say,
"Yep, it's obvious

34:07.625 --> 34:10.167
it's the <i>Captain Lawrence,</i>
and this is why."

34:10.333 --> 34:13.625
It was nice knowing that
all of my nights awake,

34:13.708 --> 34:16.750
doing all this research,
that I wasn't crazy.

34:16.875 --> 34:19.208
Look, to me,
the most important thing

34:19.333 --> 34:22.208
you guys need to do
is get your permits,

34:22.333 --> 34:23.583
talk to the appropriate people.

34:23.708 --> 34:24.917
To go look at those boxes,

34:25.042 --> 34:26.167
I'm telling you,

34:26.250 --> 34:27.958
it'll reap far more rewards

34:28.042 --> 34:29.958
if you get your ducks in order.

34:30.042 --> 34:31.500
We've got measurements,

34:31.625 --> 34:33.917
we've got two very
interesting new targets,

34:34.042 --> 34:35.500
and hopefully
these two targets

34:35.667 --> 34:37.667
on some high-quality video
to have analyzed.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.333
I mean, that's what
I'm thinking, right, Rick?

34:39.500 --> 34:41.042
-Yeah.
-MATTY: It's awesome.

34:41.167 --> 34:42.667
And it just goes to show,

34:42.792 --> 34:44.167
in just two dives,

34:44.292 --> 34:46.458
the wealth of targets
that you guys have found.

has been made manifest
by the dive team.

a lot of effort

35:23.333 --> 35:25.833
on both mine and Jess's part,

35:25.958 --> 35:27.500

determined than ever

The story,

the visual sighting
from the air,

and then we saw another
wreck over the top of it,

36:38.292 --> 36:39.667
-like this.
-Wow.

36:39.792 --> 36:42.333
RICK: The whole story
lined up. So...

36:42.458 --> 36:43.333
Did you image a chest?

36:43.458 --> 36:45.458
Did anybody see a chest?

36:45.542 --> 36:48.458
You know, the divers
did say that they saw

36:48.583 --> 36:50.333
a square anomaly down there,

36:50.458 --> 36:52.042
which, you gotta think chest.

36:52.167 --> 36:54.000
And it was highly descriptive.

36:54.458 --> 36:57.000
He saw it tucked away in an area

36:57.125 --> 36:58.333
-that he couldn't get to.
-Yep, yep.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.250
You know,
the wreck is all over it,

37:00.375 --> 37:02.500
and there's
a little open space,

37:02.667 --> 37:04.375
and he sees this chest.
And the other thing

37:04.542 --> 37:05.833
he's looking for, of course,
are these chains.

37:05.958 --> 37:06.917
-Chains.
-'Cause that's

37:07.042 --> 37:08.167

you could be in business.

So, we do.

37:33.083 --> 37:34.208
We've got two big things,

37:34.375 --> 37:36.208
I think, that came up

37:36.333 --> 37:38.375
since we were out there last.

37:40.375 --> 37:42.708
And one of them is,

37:42.833 --> 37:44.500
as clear as day,

37:44.583 --> 37:47.083
a chain coming out from

37:47.208 --> 37:49.583
what we think is
the <i>Captain Lawrence.</i>

♪ ♪

37:59.125 --> 38:01.542
MATTY: Wait a sec.
So, since we left,

38:01.667 --> 38:03.625
you've seen chains down there?
On that site?

38:03.708 --> 38:04.875
Correct.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.625
I mean...

38:07.583 --> 38:09.458
Did you get any images
or anything of it?

38:09.583 --> 38:12.000
We do. We have

-Great.
<i>-So whenever you're ready.</i>

38:13.167 --> 38:14.333

I'd love to see these images.

38:17.125 --> 38:18.500
Oh, wow!

38:19.417 --> 38:22.833
I see it right there.
Look at that.

38:22.917 --> 38:24.667
-See that?
-That's a chain,

38:24.833 --> 38:26.500
and that looks old.

38:26.667 --> 38:28.458
RICK:
Mike, can you explain
where that is, about?

38:28.583 --> 38:31.458
So that's actually in one of
the deeper sections of the dive,

38:31.583 --> 38:33.375
which would also make sense

38:33.500 --> 38:35.875
if they were salvaging
that other ship

38:36.042 --> 38:37.500
and snagged the chain.

38:38.417 --> 38:40.500
So, on the left
is part of the wreck

38:40.625 --> 38:42.417
which we think is
the <i>Captain Lawrence.</i>

38:42.542 --> 38:44.458
Then on the right is the chain,

38:44.542 --> 38:46.333
which goes
underneath the decking.

38:47.833 --> 38:49.750
Man, so there could be
a box attached to that chain

38:49.875 --> 38:51.250
under the wreck again

38:51.375 --> 38:53.875
-with more treasure in it.
<i>-GORLEAU: Right.</i>

38:54.042 --> 38:55.833

extends out quite a ways,</i>

38:55.958 --> 38:58.375

in the zebra mussels,</i>

38:58.542 --> 38:59.750

the metal detector will come in</i>

38:59.875 --> 39:01.292

the end of the chain</i>

39:01.417 --> 39:02.500
<i>and where it goes.</i>

39:02.583 --> 39:04.167
MATTY:
Given the fact that

39:04.292 --> 39:05.750
everything you found,
with two shipwrecks

39:05.875 --> 39:07.333
on top of each other,
in that area...

39:07.458 --> 39:09.292
-The older wreck...
-The older wreck

39:09.375 --> 39:12.000
underneath the newer one,
and then

39:12.125 --> 39:14.083
two chests,
and now a chain!

39:14.208 --> 39:17.667
Now, to me, that chain
becomes possibly a smoking gun.

39:18.583 --> 39:20.833
I mean, it definitely fits.
The chain definitely fits

39:20.958 --> 39:23.583
the wreck it comes out of.

39:23.708 --> 39:26.625
So... and this is the second
thing we want to show you.

39:27.792 --> 39:30.125
We picked it up on
a side-scan near the wrecks.

39:30.250 --> 39:31.500
We think it could be a chest.

39:31.625 --> 39:33.167
MATTY:
My goodness.

39:33.750 --> 39:35.083
RICK:
If it is a box,

39:35.208 --> 39:37.167
how close to the wreck is it?

39:37.250 --> 39:39.167
Uh, I would say probably
200, 300 yards.

39:39.292 --> 39:40.500
(exhales)

39:40.625 --> 39:42.458
That sure looks like a box.

39:42.542 --> 39:43.542
You know,
when we were out there,

39:43.667 --> 39:45.208
there was a lot of rocks.

39:46.167 --> 39:48.458
But this thing looks like
it's sitting by itself.

39:49.375 --> 39:51.333
GROLEAU:
It is. It's all out in the open

39:51.458 --> 39:53.167
sitting by itself,
and if you look at the shadow,

39:53.292 --> 39:55.333
it's very square, as well.

39:55.458 --> 39:58.000
So, I think it's got
well-defined edges on it,

39:58.125 --> 39:59.500
and it's something
we need to

39:59.625 --> 40:02.042
get the ROV down or
a diver down and look at.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.292
Wow. So that's

40:04.375 --> 40:06.292
three chests and a chain.

40:06.417 --> 40:07.833
(laughing)

40:07.917 --> 40:09.250
And a newer wreck
on top of an older wreck.

40:09.375 --> 40:10.833
This is starting to fit, huh?

40:10.958 --> 40:12.333
MATTY:
It's starting to really fit.

40:12.500 --> 40:13.500
MARTY:
Do you think

40:13.583 --> 40:14.667
the State of Michigan would

40:14.792 --> 40:16.583
eventually let you salvage it,

40:16.708 --> 40:18.000
or what's your thoughts
on that?

40:18.083 --> 40:18.833
<i>GROLEAU:
I think so.</i>

40:19.000 --> 40:20.208
We have been in contact,

40:20.375 --> 40:21.875
we've sent some emails

40:22.042 --> 40:24.000
and we're starting
that process right now.

40:24.083 --> 40:25.958
Unbelievable, you guys.

40:26.083 --> 40:27.458
This is next-level.

40:27.583 --> 40:29.292
-I mean, this is more...
-Yeah, this is

40:29.375 --> 40:30.458
way further along
than I thought.

40:30.542 --> 40:31.833
(sighs) Really,

40:32.000 --> 40:33.375
really great work.

40:33.500 --> 40:35.125
You know, Mike,
your expertise

40:35.250 --> 40:36.667
and your dogged determination

40:36.750 --> 40:38.542
has turned up clue
after clue after clue.

40:38.667 --> 40:40.792
You told us
this was a site of interest,

40:40.875 --> 40:43.500
and there's been nothing
<i>not</i> interesting so far.

40:43.583 --> 40:45.333
And Jess, you impressed me

40:45.417 --> 40:46.667
right away at
that airport hangar

40:46.792 --> 40:48.167
with the research
you'd done.

40:48.333 --> 40:50.458
-So, congratulations.
-Thank you.

40:50.542 --> 40:52.417
All right, then.

40:52.542 --> 40:53.542
We will definitely
stay in touch.

40:53.667 --> 40:55.333
Get those salvage rights,

40:55.458 --> 40:56.625
and if there is a next step,

40:56.750 --> 40:58.333
they're going to want
to be there.

40:58.417 --> 40:59.500
<i>GROLEAU:
Well, we look forward.</i>

40:59.667 --> 41:01.125
Best of luck, guys.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.542
-MATTY: Congrats.
-MARTY: Till the

41:02.667 --> 41:04.042
-next time, stay safe.
-Bye, guys.

41:04.208 --> 41:05.917
All right.

41:06.042 --> 41:07.750
MATTY:
I hope they get the rights,

41:07.875 --> 41:09.000
'cause they should be able
to salvage this.

41:09.125 --> 41:10.167
Identify it.

41:10.292 --> 41:11.542
If nothing else,
then to say to

41:11.708 --> 41:12.875
the State of Michigan

41:13.000 --> 41:14.500
and the country
and the world,

41:14.667 --> 41:16.208
"We've identified
this story as true.

41:16.375 --> 41:17.250
This happened."

41:17.375 --> 41:18.792
Well, there would be some

41:18.917 --> 41:20.500
real history-changing things
in those chests.

41:20.583 --> 41:21.500
It's not just gold,
it would be...

41:21.583 --> 41:22.833
"Who did this?"

41:22.917 --> 41:25.333
-Yes.
-RICK: Every treasure hunt

41:25.500 --> 41:26.917
is an information hunt as well,

41:27.042 --> 41:29.292
and this will provide
some unique perspective

41:29.375 --> 41:32.667
on Civil War, Confederacy,

41:32.750 --> 41:34.167
-...you know...
-It could. Yeah.

41:34.292 --> 41:35.500
...who associated with whom?

41:35.625 --> 41:37.833
And right in your backyard.

41:37.958 --> 41:39.042
-MARTY: Yes.
-MATTY: Pretty cool.

41:39.208 --> 41:40.208
Right in our backyard.

41:40.333 --> 41:42.667
Well, speaking of your backyard,

41:42.750 --> 41:43.667
you've got a pretty big one
right out here that you

41:43.792 --> 41:45.083
need to get back to, so...

41:45.208 --> 41:47.500
Yeah, we do. Need to have--

41:47.583 --> 41:48.917
I want to see some images
like that back here.

41:49.042 --> 41:50.875
Yeah, I know, right?
We need that image.

41:51.042 --> 41:52.958
MARTY:
We'd like to see a box, right?
