00:01.343 --> 00:02.835
<i>Previously on</i> Hawaii Five-O:

00:03.279 --> 00:04.954
I've seen super-grade level
cryptography before,

00:04.955 --> 00:06.895
but this is, like,
off-the-grid hacker world.

00:06.995 --> 00:08.295
Think I know a guy
who can help us.

00:08.297 --> 00:10.263
<i>His hacker handle is Toast.</i>

00:10.265 --> 00:12.199
First case I worked
when I got here six months ago,

00:12.201 --> 00:13.433
he got busted hacking into ATMs

00:13.435 --> 00:14.501
all around the island.

00:14.503 --> 00:15.635
<i>Really a genius</i>

00:15.637 --> 00:16.703
42 minutes of the day.

00:16.705 --> 00:18.538
What about the
rest of the time?

00:18.540 --> 00:19.906
Baked like a potato.

00:19.908 --> 00:21.441
Ah, <i>pakalolo.</i>

00:21.443 --> 00:23.076
Take your time, Toast.
I mean, it's-it's...

00:23.078 --> 00:24.111
it's just national security.

00:24.113 --> 00:26.513
I'll take my time
and do it right.

00:26.515 --> 00:28.782
- Can I smoke in here, guys?
- No.

00:28.784 --> 00:31.184
Fortunately, we had a bit
more luck with the hacker.

00:31.186 --> 00:32.619
This guy.

00:32.621 --> 00:33.720
Aaron Wright.

00:33.722 --> 00:35.255
Need to figure out what a hacker

00:35.257 --> 00:36.757
wants with a pyro
like Duclair.

00:36.759 --> 00:38.558
The question is not
what I want with Duclair.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.861
It's: What's Duclair going to do
now that he's escaped?

00:40.863 --> 00:42.596
He's locked us out of the system.
What do you mean,

00:42.598 --> 00:44.698
he's locked us out
of the system?

00:44.700 --> 00:46.299
Good luck.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.159
What's up, coach?

01:12.161 --> 01:14.094
McGarrett.
Good to see you.

01:14.096 --> 01:15.762
How's he doing?

01:15.764 --> 01:17.464
The truth?
Yeah.

01:17.466 --> 01:19.966
I don't think
he's HPD material.

01:19.968 --> 01:21.067
Wait a minute. You serious?

01:21.069 --> 01:22.402
He's going through
it right now.

01:22.404 --> 01:24.471
Give him a couple of
days, let him settle in.

01:24.473 --> 01:25.872
No, no, it's not that.

01:25.874 --> 01:27.974
In fact, he might be
the best raw talent

01:27.976 --> 01:29.409
I've ever had as a recruit.

01:29.411 --> 01:31.711
This kid has got speed,
strength, agility--

01:31.713 --> 01:33.046
the whole package.

01:33.048 --> 01:35.081
So, what's the problem?
Why isn't he HPD material?

01:35.083 --> 01:37.284
He reminds me of you, McGarrett.

01:38.554 --> 01:40.954
Okay, so he's a little
enthusiastic.

01:40.956 --> 01:42.656
But this kid,
I can already tell,

01:42.658 --> 01:43.990
he's got a streak in him.

01:43.992 --> 01:45.592
Hey, Junior, what's
up there, buddy?

01:45.594 --> 01:47.461
Hey, Commander McGarrett.
It's great to see you, sir.

01:47.463 --> 01:48.862
Good to see you.
How you doing?

01:48.864 --> 01:50.197
Yeah, good, sir.
It's great to be here.

01:50.199 --> 01:51.565
Instructor Alves
is not, uh...

01:51.567 --> 01:53.400
he's not working you
too hard, is he?

01:53.402 --> 01:54.734
No, sir.

01:54.736 --> 01:56.837
In fact, I told him
he can push me more

01:56.839 --> 01:57.904
and a little bit harder.

01:57.906 --> 01:59.105
I welcome the challenge.

01:59.107 --> 02:00.607
I'm sure you do.
Hey, listen.

02:00.609 --> 02:02.476
What are you doing
today for lunch, 1:00?

02:04.580 --> 02:06.313
Okay, Kamekona's
got a shrimp truck

02:06.315 --> 02:08.215
on the south side of
town here, all right?

02:08.217 --> 02:09.883
By the Hilton, right
in front of Bowls.

02:09.884 --> 02:11.050
I'll find it, sir.

02:11.053 --> 02:12.352
And, uh...

02:12.354 --> 02:14.154
what'd I tell you
about the “sirs”?

02:14.156 --> 02:14.985
Yeah, copy.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.324
I got somewhere to be.
I'll see you at 1:00.

02:16.325 --> 02:18.692
1300. I'll be there.

02:30.806 --> 02:32.506
Oh, yeah.

02:32.508 --> 02:34.207
This is good.
This is good.

02:34.209 --> 02:35.742
This is perfect.

02:35.744 --> 02:37.110
This will work
very well.

02:37.112 --> 02:39.145
What's all them
brown spots?

02:39.147 --> 02:40.413
It's nothing.
It's... you know,

02:40.415 --> 02:42.282
a bit of elbow grease
will clear that right up.

02:42.284 --> 02:44.851
Yeah, I-I don't think
this is a good idea.

02:44.853 --> 02:47.521
Why not? People buy used
kitchen equipment all the time.

02:47.523 --> 02:48.822
By the way,
not to mention

02:48.824 --> 02:50.557
the amount of money we're
gonna save on this.

02:50.559 --> 02:52.459
I thought you of all people
would appreciate that.

02:52.461 --> 02:54.394
Oh, I do. Yeah.

02:54.396 --> 02:55.829
Yeah, but no.

02:55.831 --> 02:58.698
Nah, I don't think
it's a good idea.

02:58.700 --> 02:59.733
Why not?

02:59.735 --> 03:01.067
Your partner's
out of town,

03:01.069 --> 03:03.403
and you know how he is.

03:03.405 --> 03:05.505
You going rogue,
don't you expect to get

03:05.507 --> 03:07.574
a little bit of a blowback
or something on this?

03:07.576 --> 03:09.809
Let me explain
something to you, okay?

03:09.811 --> 03:10.977
This right here,

03:10.979 --> 03:13.980
this is the Cadillac
of industrial ovens.

03:13.982 --> 03:16.883
Now, you can't get one of these
for less than ten grand.

03:16.885 --> 03:18.418
But for today only,

03:18.420 --> 03:21.221
Danny and I can have this
for a quarter of the price.

03:21.223 --> 03:23.256
How do I not pull
the trigger on that?

03:23.258 --> 03:24.891
You're talking to a brother
from Chicago,

03:24.893 --> 03:26.626
so you had me at Cadillac.
All right.

03:26.628 --> 03:28.595
And I'm not saying
it's not a good deal.

03:28.597 --> 03:30.630
I'm just saying...
Huh?

03:30.632 --> 03:32.566
maybe you ought to loop
your partner in on this.

03:32.568 --> 03:35.168
No, no, no. Danny and I
have complete confidence

03:35.170 --> 03:36.903
in each other's
decision-making abilities.

03:36.905 --> 03:38.271
Oh, is that right?

03:38.273 --> 03:41.007
Why you laughing?
Okay, then.

03:41.009 --> 03:42.075
What are you doing?

03:42.077 --> 03:43.109
Oh, I'm just
calling Danny,

03:43.111 --> 03:44.811
you know, so he can
sign off on this.

03:44.813 --> 03:46.680
That way, I don't have to hear
all the yaketa-yaketa-yaketa

03:46.682 --> 03:48.748
for the next month, you know.
Yeah.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.585
- That-that's not a problem, is it?
- No, no problem.

03:51.587 --> 03:52.499
Okay.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.088
What time is it in
Jersey right now?

03:54.089 --> 03:55.589
It's 1:00 p.m. in Jersey.

03:55.591 --> 03:57.257
He's at his, uh... his
niece's confirmation.

03:57.259 --> 03:58.892
Confirmation. You don't want...
It's ringing. It's ringing.

03:58.894 --> 04:00.226
No, just hang...
hang up the phone.

04:00.228 --> 04:01.294
Hey, hey, Danny, what...?
Okay.

04:01.296 --> 04:02.462
Hang up. What are you doing?

04:02.464 --> 04:03.863
Why would you do that?

04:03.865 --> 04:05.065
It's not funny.

04:05.067 --> 04:06.633
He's driving me crazy.

04:06.635 --> 04:08.001
He only wants to buy new.

04:08.003 --> 04:09.669
He's fixated on
having a warrantee.

04:09.671 --> 04:11.671
You know what he's like.
He's so by the book.

04:11.673 --> 04:13.573
- He's nuts.
- Yeah, what a surprise.

04:13.575 --> 04:14.874
Whatever. Here's
the bottom line.

04:14.876 --> 04:17.110
These things, they're
basically indestructible.

04:17.112 --> 04:20.245
Okay? Danny's problem--
he wants to take the risk

04:20.248 --> 04:22.782
out of what is inherently
a risky venture.

04:22.784 --> 04:25.218
If he wants to play it safe,
why is he opening a restaurant?

04:25.220 --> 04:27.387
And, for God's sake,
why have you as a partner?

04:27.389 --> 04:31.391
Right?

04:31.393 --> 04:33.159
Well, s-speaking of partners.

04:33.161 --> 04:35.762
Oh, it's Danny. Uh-oh.
Huh. Look at that.

04:35.764 --> 04:36.763
It's Toast.

04:36.765 --> 04:39.733
Hey, yo, Toast, what's up, man?

04:39.735 --> 04:41.901
Toast. Hey, Toast?

04:41.903 --> 04:44.204
Oh, he butt-dialed you.

04:44.206 --> 04:46.039
That upsets me.
I knew... I knew he was

04:46.041 --> 04:48.174
too big now
to call me on purpose.

04:48.176 --> 04:50.577
Whatever. Hey, Toast's butt,
I'm hanging up. How about that?

04:50.579 --> 04:52.545
What was that?

04:52.547 --> 04:55.015
- What's wrong?
- Nothing else to say?

04:55.017 --> 04:56.716
You're not talking much now,
are you?

04:58.620 --> 05:00.387
Hey, hey, Jerry, listen to me.

05:00.389 --> 05:02.055
McGarrett is on
a phone call with Toast.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.459
Need you to lock
onto the signal,

05:06.461 --> 05:07.994
tell me where that call
is coming from.

05:07.996 --> 05:08.930
Lou, I got a gunshot.

05:08.954 --> 05:10.731
Life and death.
I need those coordinates, man.

05:10.732 --> 05:11.698
Ten minutes from here.

05:57.012 --> 05:58.144
This wasn't just a murder.

05:58.146 --> 05:59.746
Somebody wanted him to suffer.

05:59.748 --> 06:02.182
No doubt.

06:05.754 --> 06:06.853
Steve.

06:06.855 --> 06:08.388
Come on.

06:08.390 --> 06:10.123
Thanks, Noelani.

06:11.593 --> 06:13.793
You think somebody found out
that Toast was a CI?

06:13.795 --> 06:17.263
It's possible.
Or money.

06:17.265 --> 06:19.132
You said the guy was loaded,
right? Big tech money?

06:19.134 --> 06:22.669
Yeah, he was, but the beatdown
tells me it was personal, no?

06:22.671 --> 06:24.671
Yeah. Revenge.

06:24.673 --> 06:26.973
Look, Toast helped us out
with a lot of big cases.

06:26.975 --> 06:28.808
There was a lot of
serious players involved.

06:28.810 --> 06:30.877
Any one of those guys could've
been looking for payback.

06:30.879 --> 06:32.045
Jerry?

06:32.047 --> 06:34.147
Hate to be the bearer
of bad news--

06:34.149 --> 06:35.849
well, more bad news--
but it seems

06:35.851 --> 06:37.784
someone hacked
into our system last night.

06:37.786 --> 06:39.719
- We got any idea who?
- Not yet.

06:39.721 --> 06:42.689
Thing is, this was
a pretty sophisticated attack.

06:42.691 --> 06:44.858
Whoever was behind it knew
how to cover their tracks.

06:44.860 --> 06:47.193
Well, do we know how deeply
they got into our system?

06:47.195 --> 06:48.361
Not exactly.

06:48.363 --> 06:49.829
But if Toast's murder

06:49.831 --> 06:52.031
is connected to him
being a CI,

06:52.033 --> 06:54.367
this could explain
how that information got out.

06:54.369 --> 06:56.002
Right, and if we can uncover
who's behind the breach,

06:56.004 --> 06:57.337
maybe we can find
Toast's killer.

06:57.339 --> 06:58.505
Right.

06:58.507 --> 06:59.739
Only problem is, the person we'd

06:59.741 --> 07:01.441
ordinarily go
to help us with that

07:01.443 --> 07:03.143
is dead.

07:07.549 --> 07:08.948
So you want me to figure out

07:08.950 --> 07:10.650
who accessed your server
and smoked your CI.

07:10.652 --> 07:12.852
Yes, that's what we're saying.

07:12.854 --> 07:14.554
Well, I'm flattered, fellas.

07:14.556 --> 07:17.223
I gotta tell you, though,
I'm a little surprised.

07:17.225 --> 07:19.192
'Cause I, you know, figured
that you'd find someone

07:19.194 --> 07:20.860
who was a little more
inclined to, uh...

07:20.862 --> 07:24.097
I don't know, care.

07:24.099 --> 07:25.665
We did.

07:25.667 --> 07:28.101
His name was Toast.

07:28.103 --> 07:30.470
Unfortunately, now he's...

07:30.472 --> 07:32.472
Toast?

07:32.474 --> 07:34.974
I'm sorry. Was that too soon?

07:34.976 --> 07:36.609
You want to hit him, or can I?

07:37.612 --> 07:40.013
You're the last person
we wanted to see.

07:40.015 --> 07:42.816
But you breached our
system successfully,

07:42.818 --> 07:44.651
which makes you the expert--
you understand?

07:44.653 --> 07:47.320
And, apparently, a trendsetter.
Right.

07:47.322 --> 07:49.522
Are you gonna help us or not?

07:49.524 --> 07:51.257
No.

07:51.259 --> 07:52.559
Okay.

07:52.561 --> 07:54.594
Let's get out of here, Lou.

07:54.596 --> 07:56.896
All right. You want my help?

07:57.666 --> 07:59.465
There's gonna be conditions.
What?

07:59.467 --> 08:00.800
I want to be transferred
out of here.

08:00.802 --> 08:02.202
Because, when I'm done,
people in here

08:02.204 --> 08:03.703
are gonna know
that I helped you.

08:03.705 --> 08:05.371
As your friend Toast
just found out,

08:05.373 --> 08:07.040
that's not gonna make me
so popular.

08:09.811 --> 08:11.344
I can get you a transfer.
Good.

08:11.346 --> 08:13.279
And while I'm helping you,

08:13.281 --> 08:16.082
I want to stay
in a fancy hotel suite

08:16.084 --> 08:18.051
that's got a little Japanese
toilet that sings to you.

08:18.053 --> 08:20.019
'Cause, for the past month,
I've been cooped up

08:20.021 --> 08:21.921
in a miserable little cell
eating nothing but slop

08:21.923 --> 08:23.156
and squatting on a steel bowl.

08:23.158 --> 08:24.657
I want 24-hour
room service,

08:24.659 --> 08:26.659
in-room spa treatments,

08:26.661 --> 08:28.228
chocolate truffles
on the nightstand,

08:28.230 --> 08:29.329
the whole nine.

08:29.331 --> 08:30.396
None of that's gonna happen.

08:30.398 --> 08:31.531
I get your transfer-- that's it.

08:31.533 --> 08:33.366
Then I guess we're done. Guards!

08:33.368 --> 08:34.868
Whoa, sit down.
We're not done yet.

08:34.870 --> 08:36.436
No, no, we are finished.
You know why?

08:36.438 --> 08:38.004
'Cause, right now,
I'm gonna take a nice

08:38.006 --> 08:39.639
little walk back to
my miserable little cell,

08:39.640 --> 08:42.275
secure in the knowledge
that you two will be back.

08:42.277 --> 08:45.678
Because you guys really want to
find out who killed your friend.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.947
And in order to do that,

08:47.949 --> 08:49.916
you need the best.

08:55.790 --> 08:57.790

09:06.801 --> 09:10.036

09:10.038 --> 09:11.704
Why is the masseuse
wearing Kevlar?

09:11.706 --> 09:13.072
She looks familiar to me.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.841
Have we met?
Yeah.

09:14.843 --> 09:16.609
I saved your ass
when you were tied up

09:16.611 --> 09:17.644
and covered in gasoline.

09:17.646 --> 09:19.545
You know, crying
and begging for your life.

09:19.547 --> 09:21.214
Oh. Yeah.

09:22.484 --> 09:24.183
Not my proudest moment.

09:24.185 --> 09:26.352
Speaking of tied up...

09:26.354 --> 09:27.420
What are you doing?

09:27.422 --> 09:28.454
What are you doing? Yo.

09:28.456 --> 09:29.455
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:29.457 --> 09:31.491
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:31.493 --> 09:33.593
Now how am I supposed to use
the Japanese toilet?

09:33.595 --> 09:36.896
You're familiar
with the steel bowl, right?

09:41.102 --> 09:43.169
That's not cool.

09:44.339 --> 09:46.239
Get to work.

09:47.242 --> 09:49.575
<i>Where are we</i>
<i>with suspects, Jerry?</i>

09:49.577 --> 09:51.277
<i>Anybody jump out at you</i>

09:51.279 --> 09:53.546
from any of the cases
that Toast helped us out on?

09:53.548 --> 09:55.715
Not yet. Of all the people
that Toast either directly

09:55.717 --> 09:57.917
or indirectly helped us
incarcerate,

09:57.919 --> 09:59.285
most of them
are still in prison.

09:59.287 --> 10:00.853
One's dead.
The only one who's out

10:00.855 --> 10:03.356
just recently checked in with
his parole officer in Maine.

10:03.358 --> 10:04.657
Well, keep digging.

10:04.659 --> 10:06.426
We need to find out
if those guys

10:06.428 --> 10:09.462
have any friends or relatives,
business associates--

10:09.464 --> 10:11.030
anybody who might have a reason

10:11.032 --> 10:12.966
to have it in for Toast.
I'm on it.

10:27.382 --> 10:28.548
Commander?

10:28.550 --> 10:30.216
Better come in here.

10:33.788 --> 10:36.356
What do you got? You figure out
who we're dealing with or what?

10:36.358 --> 10:37.623
Not who just yet,

10:37.625 --> 10:39.559
but I can tell you
what they got into.

10:39.561 --> 10:42.829
And, uh, I don't think
you're gonna like it.

10:46.901 --> 10:49.135
That's every single
confidential informant

10:49.137 --> 10:51.170
we've ever worked with.

10:51.172 --> 10:54.674
If I had to guess, uh...
not so confidential anymore.

10:54.676 --> 10:56.476
So, what happened to Toast...

10:56.478 --> 10:58.745
Could happen to any one
of these people next.

Hey.

11:38.079 --> 11:40.245
Hey, Junior.
What's up?

11:40.247 --> 11:43.215
Hey, Troy. Kamekona around?

11:43.217 --> 11:44.583
Haven't seen him today.

11:44.585 --> 11:46.185
Thanks.

11:47.455 --> 11:48.954
Everything okay?

11:48.956 --> 11:51.757
Yeah. Just a...

11:51.759 --> 11:53.359
...tough day.

11:53.361 --> 11:55.227
The only easy day was yesterday.

11:55.229 --> 11:57.296
Hooyah.
Hooyah.

11:57.298 --> 11:59.598
How you doing, pal?

11:59.600 --> 12:01.700
Yeah, good.
How much sleep you getting?

12:01.702 --> 12:03.636
Enough.

12:03.638 --> 12:04.703
I love your positive attitude.

12:04.705 --> 12:06.639
I tell you what--
it's okay

12:06.641 --> 12:10.042
if everything's not okay
all the time.

12:10.945 --> 12:13.178
I remember what it's
like coming back.

12:13.180 --> 12:15.347
Guys like you and me,
we got sea legs, right?

12:15.349 --> 12:18.450
Get back home, it can be tricky.

12:18.452 --> 12:20.519
It's a process.
It is a process.

12:20.521 --> 12:23.656
I want to help you through
that process, okay?

12:23.658 --> 12:24.890
However I can.

12:24.892 --> 12:27.092
Now, look, getting you
onto that Five-O task force,

12:27.094 --> 12:28.360
I think, is gonna be

12:28.362 --> 12:29.595
a significant step.

12:29.597 --> 12:31.330
I need you to know,

12:31.332 --> 12:34.099
you gotta graduate
from that police academy.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.502
Okay? It's important.
That's the way it works.

12:36.504 --> 12:38.404
Is that always the way it works?

12:39.273 --> 12:41.073
It's the way
I think it should work.

12:41.075 --> 12:42.975
Understood.
All right, good.

12:42.977 --> 12:44.777
Thank you. Now, listen,
whatever I can do,

12:44.779 --> 12:46.045
if you want to talk...

12:46.047 --> 12:47.413
Actually, you know what?

12:48.949 --> 12:50.315
Give me your number.

12:50.317 --> 12:51.617
Yeah, I don't have a phone.

12:51.619 --> 12:52.751
You don't have a cell phone?

12:52.753 --> 12:54.420
No.

12:54.422 --> 12:56.321
Okay. It's not a problem.

12:56.323 --> 12:57.656
I'll, uh...
I'll have somebody

12:57.658 --> 12:59.191
drop one by the academy
this afternoon.

12:59.193 --> 13:01.093
Thank you.

13:01.095 --> 13:02.528
This is work.
I gotta get it.

13:02.530 --> 13:05.464
Sure.
Hi, Jerry.

13:05.466 --> 13:06.465
What's the latest?

13:06.467 --> 13:07.800
All our CIs accounted for?

13:07.802 --> 13:09.234
Almost.
I just heard from Grover.

13:09.236 --> 13:11.837
He's with Bones now.
All right, what about Hirsch?

13:11.839 --> 13:13.639
Hirsch and Barry Burns
are safe at HPD.

13:13.641 --> 13:14.907
I'm at Kamekona's truck.

13:14.909 --> 13:16.642
He's not here.
Kamekona's on the North Shore

13:16.644 --> 13:18.644
doing an inspection
of Flippa's truck.

13:18.646 --> 13:20.512
Said he'll come in after that.
Hey. Sang Min?

13:20.514 --> 13:23.515
That's kind of a situation
in progress.

13:23.517 --> 13:25.050
He's having a little
get-together with

13:25.052 --> 13:27.019
a few lady friends and is
reluctant to end the party.

13:27.021 --> 13:28.520
Well, how about this--
you tell HPD

13:28.522 --> 13:30.055
that they can arrest his ass

13:30.057 --> 13:31.056
if they need to.

13:31.058 --> 13:32.691
Call Kamekona.
Tell him I'm gonna

13:32.693 --> 13:35.160
head up to Flippa's truck
and, uh, I'll escort him back.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.528
Copy that.

13:42.570 --> 13:45.571
Hello.

13:45.573 --> 13:47.906
I think you, me and your
Five-O buddies just got lucky,

13:47.908 --> 13:49.441
because I just found
a fingerprint.

13:49.443 --> 13:50.609
A what?

13:50.611 --> 13:52.077
There. See?

13:52.079 --> 13:53.479
Buried in the code.

13:53.481 --> 13:54.680
M-O-G-E...

13:54.682 --> 13:56.915
Mogera. It's a signature.

13:56.917 --> 13:59.184
Like the tag
of a graffiti artist.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.453
So you're telling me
that somebody was able to breach

14:01.455 --> 14:03.989
our system, but then
was dumb enough to leave a name?

14:03.991 --> 14:05.724
Dumb? No.

14:05.726 --> 14:08.227
Arrogant, sure.

14:08.229 --> 14:10.095
But you guys never
would have found it.

14:10.097 --> 14:12.164
And if you had, a hacker's
handle doesn't incriminate them,

14:12.166 --> 14:14.700
because it doesn't betray
their real-world identity.

14:15.536 --> 14:17.503
Yeah, that's true.

14:17.505 --> 14:19.638
Except...

14:19.640 --> 14:22.107
when another hacker
finds it.

14:22.109 --> 14:24.109
Like me.

14:24.111 --> 14:25.644
So, you know
this guy Mogera?

14:25.646 --> 14:26.678
Oh, yeah.

14:26.680 --> 14:27.713
He's a legend.

14:27.715 --> 14:28.814
I met him once.

14:28.816 --> 14:30.215
Believe it or not, the guy's...

14:30.217 --> 14:31.450
actually blind.

14:31.452 --> 14:33.452
So, what's his real name?

14:47.902 --> 14:49.935
- Is there anybody inside?
- Don't know. I can't get close.

14:49.937 --> 14:51.937
Get everybody back.
There's propane tanks in there.

14:51.939 --> 14:54.206
Everybody, get back. Get back!

14:56.944 --> 14:58.610
Kamekona?

15:00.114 --> 15:01.413
Flippa!

15:10.157 --> 15:11.824
Nahele!

15:11.826 --> 15:13.959
Nahele?

15:13.961 --> 15:14.993
Nahele.

15:14.995 --> 15:17.095
We gotta get out of
here, kid. Come on.

15:17.097 --> 15:18.630
Come on.

15:18.632 --> 15:20.866
Up, up, up.
Come on! Come on.

15:20.868 --> 15:22.601
Come on.

15:41.989 --> 15:44.590
Nahele. Nahele.

15:44.592 --> 15:46.258
Hey.

15:46.260 --> 15:48.961
It's all right.
Take it easy.

15:48.963 --> 15:51.029
Just breathe, breathe.

15:51.031 --> 15:52.464
Nahele, who did this?

15:52.466 --> 15:54.099
Two... two men.

15:54.101 --> 15:55.601
Black SUV.

15:55.603 --> 15:58.437
They torched the truck
and left me inside.

15:58.439 --> 16:01.640
Where's Kamekona?
He was supposed to be here.

16:02.476 --> 16:04.109
They took him.

16:04.111 --> 16:05.644
He's gone.

16:22.079 --> 16:23.144
All right.

16:23.146 --> 16:25.713
I'll be right back.
All right?

16:25.715 --> 16:27.215
Jerry, talk to me.

16:27.217 --> 16:30.051
Tried pinging Kamekona's cell,
but it's been disabled.

16:30.053 --> 16:32.620
Got a helicopter headed your way
to help with the aerial search

16:32.622 --> 16:34.422
for that black SUV
that Nahele mentioned,

16:34.424 --> 16:35.723
but whoever grabbed Kamekona's

16:35.725 --> 16:37.459
got a pretty good
head start on us.

16:37.461 --> 16:38.660
All right, what about suspects?

16:38.662 --> 16:39.794
Working on it.

16:39.796 --> 16:41.529
But it's a pretty long list.

16:41.531 --> 16:43.665
Kamekona burned a lot
of bad guys over the years.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.667
I know. Just keep looking.
See if anybody stands out.

16:45.669 --> 16:47.502
Where are we at with that hacker
that Wright said

16:47.504 --> 16:48.536
breached our system?

16:48.538 --> 16:49.537
Mogera?

16:49.539 --> 16:50.872
Grover just brought him in.

16:50.874 --> 16:52.774
I get the feeling
he's not being too forthcoming,

16:52.776 --> 16:54.676
but at least we got his laptop.
That's good.

16:54.678 --> 16:56.578
If he won't talk, then maybe
there'll be something on

16:56.580 --> 16:58.913
that laptop that'll tell us
what he did with the CI list.

16:59.716 --> 17:01.116
Mr. Taylor,
by nature,

17:01.118 --> 17:02.784
I'm a patient man.

17:02.786 --> 17:06.320
But today, my patience
is starting to wear a bit thin.

17:06.323 --> 17:10.758
Who did you share that list of
confidential informants with?

17:10.760 --> 17:13.661
Look, I know
you're blind, Harley,

17:13.663 --> 17:16.464
but you damn sure
ain't deaf.

17:16.465 --> 17:18.532
And you ain't a mute,
either, are you?

17:18.535 --> 17:20.602
You stole a list

17:20.604 --> 17:23.738
of confidential informants
from our system.

17:23.740 --> 17:25.839
Then you turned around
and sold it

17:25.842 --> 17:27.842
to a bunch of bad people.

17:27.844 --> 17:29.644
I need to know who.

17:30.947 --> 17:33.314
Come on! We already
got your computer.

17:33.316 --> 17:37.318
It's only a matter of time
before we find out who.

17:39.923 --> 17:42.157
Look, you can help us, Harley.

17:42.159 --> 17:44.726
You can save us both
a lot of time.

17:44.728 --> 17:47.896
And time is something
we don't have a lot of.

17:47.898 --> 17:52.634
Because of what you've done,
there's already one man dead.

17:52.636 --> 17:55.370
And there's another man
who's missing.

17:55.372 --> 17:59.774
And that man happens to be
a really good friend of mine.

18:02.412 --> 18:04.479
Listen, you.

18:04.481 --> 18:06.814
I've never hit
a blind man.

18:07.651 --> 18:09.851
But if I were you...

18:11.121 --> 18:13.855
...that's not something I'd take
a gamble with right now.

18:26.369 --> 18:28.670
Bruddah, you're making
a big mistake.

18:28.672 --> 18:32.173
I don't know who you
think I am or what I did.

18:32.175 --> 18:35.243
You guys got the wrong guy.

18:35.245 --> 18:37.946
I don't even know you two <i>lolos.</i>

18:37.948 --> 18:40.381
No mistake, bruddah.

18:47.591 --> 18:49.657
What about me?

18:51.595 --> 18:53.194
I look familiar?

18:54.197 --> 18:55.563
Joey Kang.

18:55.565 --> 18:58.266
Long time, big guy.

18:58.268 --> 18:59.534
I thought you was locked up.

18:59.536 --> 19:01.069
What the hell is this about?

19:01.071 --> 19:03.404
You really gotta ask?

19:03.406 --> 19:05.506
I know you work for Five-O.

19:05.508 --> 19:08.876
Well, whoever told you that
is a damn liar.

19:14.651 --> 19:16.484
Don't try to play me, brah.

19:16.486 --> 19:19.020
You're a CI.

19:19.022 --> 19:20.955
I saw your name on a list.

19:20.957 --> 19:23.358
That's some bad Intel.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.660
Somebody's making
false assumptions

19:25.662 --> 19:28.830
'cause Five-O come by
the truck a lot.

19:30.166 --> 19:32.033
Cops like to eat.

19:38.908 --> 19:42.443
You know, I always knew someone
close to me ratted me out.

19:42.445 --> 19:45.013
Dude, I just never thought
it could be you.

19:45.015 --> 19:47.048
This could all be over
very quickly.

19:49.119 --> 19:51.552
I just want my 500 grand back.

19:51.554 --> 19:53.621
What?
Shh.

19:53.623 --> 19:55.223
Don't.

19:56.993 --> 19:59.160
That money disappeared
from the safe house

19:59.162 --> 20:01.529
right before I got snatched up.

20:01.531 --> 20:05.667
Only person crazy enough
to steal from me...

20:06.670 --> 20:09.337
...is someone who knew
I was about to go away.

20:09.339 --> 20:11.372
Now...

20:12.909 --> 20:14.909
I want you to think
very carefully

20:14.911 --> 20:17.345
before saying you
didn't take it.

20:18.515 --> 20:20.515
Because right now,

20:20.517 --> 20:22.850
knowing where
that money is--

20:22.852 --> 20:26.521
that is the only thing
keeping you alive.

20:36.766 --> 20:38.533
I took the money.

20:38.535 --> 20:40.535
Okay.

20:40.537 --> 20:43.237
But I don't have it no more.
It's gone.

20:43.239 --> 20:45.073
What do you mean?

20:45.075 --> 20:47.208
I mean I spent it.

20:47.210 --> 20:48.576
Really?

20:48.578 --> 20:50.845
On what?

20:50.847 --> 20:52.447
Two shrimp trucks?

20:52.449 --> 20:54.482
Your piece of crap car?

20:54.484 --> 20:56.150
I see the way you dress,

20:56.152 --> 20:57.285
live.

20:57.287 --> 20:59.454
You didn't spend it.

20:59.456 --> 21:01.422
You have it.

21:01.424 --> 21:03.458
And I want it back.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.793
I'm so sorry, but it's gone.

21:05.795 --> 21:07.795
I sure hope
you're lying.

21:07.797 --> 21:09.997
For your sake.

21:24.714 --> 21:26.247
How much longer
is this gonna take?

21:26.249 --> 21:28.116
I thought you were supposed
to be good at this.

21:28.118 --> 21:30.485
Ever hear the expression
“a watched pot never boils”?

21:30.487 --> 21:32.387
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I making you nervous?

21:32.389 --> 21:34.722
You want privacy? We can
throw you back in your cell.

21:34.724 --> 21:37.125
Like I told you, Mogera's legit.

21:37.127 --> 21:40.995
Not surprisingly, the encryption
on this laptop is no joke.

21:40.997 --> 21:43.264
Mogera's not talking,
so right now our best shot

21:43.266 --> 21:45.433
at finding out
who he sold our CIs out to

21:45.435 --> 21:46.601
is on that hardware.

21:46.603 --> 21:48.636
I understand.

21:48.638 --> 21:50.238
I'm working as fast as I can.

22:14.798 --> 22:16.464
Lovers' quarrel?

22:16.466 --> 22:18.599
What's his name?

22:18.601 --> 22:21.269
Less talking, more hacking.

22:21.271 --> 22:22.236
I can multitask.

22:22.238 --> 22:24.105
I can tell you how
to handle your boo

22:24.107 --> 22:26.507
and crack
this black hat's security.

22:26.509 --> 22:29.277
So, uh, what's the drama?

22:29.279 --> 22:31.245
It's not about a guy, okay?

22:31.247 --> 22:33.414
Not that I'd take your advice
if it was.

22:33.416 --> 22:34.782
Oh.

22:34.784 --> 22:36.117
Must be family, then.

22:36.119 --> 22:37.385
Sister?

22:37.387 --> 22:38.820
Is it your brother?

22:38.822 --> 22:40.388
Of course.

22:40.390 --> 22:43.157
I should have
recognized that look.

22:45.094 --> 22:47.462
My brother was a real pain
in the balls, too.

22:47.464 --> 22:49.130
Never-ending source of trouble.

22:49.132 --> 22:52.733
Did you just compare
your psycho brother to mine?

22:52.735 --> 22:54.302
That's right.

22:54.304 --> 22:56.003
I know about Ian.

22:56.005 --> 22:58.239
I know
that he kidnapped

22:58.241 --> 23:01.108
Captain Grover's
teenage daughter and kept her

23:01.110 --> 23:03.244
in a cage like a dog.

23:03.246 --> 23:04.846
My brother's no saint,

23:04.848 --> 23:07.815
but he's not a piece of crap
like yours was.

23:08.651 --> 23:10.051
I got it.

23:10.053 --> 23:11.719
Good.

23:11.721 --> 23:14.622
Now, shut your hole and do
what you're here to do.

23:15.558 --> 23:17.959
Lou, hey. Uh, we got
any updates on Kamekona?

23:17.961 --> 23:20.995
Not yet, but Wright's working
on Mogera's laptop.

23:20.997 --> 23:23.197
Meanwhile, we just caught
a break in the Toast murder.

23:23.199 --> 23:25.433
The ballistics report
from the crime scene

23:25.435 --> 23:28.135
matched a gun that was used
in another felony.

23:28.137 --> 23:31.739
That gun is connected to a guy
by the name of Kahili Marks.

23:31.741 --> 23:33.074
Why's he got it in for Toast?

23:34.277 --> 23:37.478
Marks is Kong Liang's
brother-in-law.

23:37.480 --> 23:38.646
At least he was.

23:38.648 --> 23:40.648
Kong was killed in a prison riot
some years back.

23:40.650 --> 23:43.451
And now Marks is gonna
hang that on Toast, right?

23:43.453 --> 23:44.719
Where's Marks now?

23:44.721 --> 23:46.053
We got no current address,

23:46.055 --> 23:47.488
but I have a BOLO out.

23:47.490 --> 23:49.223
Don't worry. We'll find him.

23:54.030 --> 23:56.230
Very quiet over there.

23:56.232 --> 23:58.132
It's called concentrating.

23:58.134 --> 24:00.101
Want me to get this done, right?

24:00.103 --> 24:02.203
How much longer?

24:02.205 --> 24:04.038
Don't worry.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.573
Won't be long now.

24:24.093 --> 24:25.760
Don't.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.021
Please hold
still, ma'am.

24:49.022 --> 24:50.088
I'm fine.

24:50.090 --> 24:51.889
Vest or no,
your body just absorbed

24:51.891 --> 24:53.157
the force of two gunshots

24:53.159 --> 24:54.957
fired at close range.
I really should check...

24:54.958 --> 24:57.462
Just... did you hear
what I said? I'm fine.

25:02.202 --> 25:04.435
There's nothing she
could have done.

25:04.437 --> 25:06.604
Against three of them,
she's lucky to be alive.

25:06.606 --> 25:09.007
I just pulled security
from outside the hotel.

25:09.009 --> 25:10.708
The perps used a sedan
that matches

25:10.710 --> 25:12.010
a vehicle registered
to Kahili Marks.

25:12.012 --> 25:13.378
So the guy
who killed Toast

25:13.380 --> 25:15.246
just turns around,
and now he breaks

25:15.248 --> 25:16.581
Aaron Wright out of here?

25:16.583 --> 25:18.483
Wright must have made some
kind of deal with him.

25:18.485 --> 25:20.518
Right? He gives up Toast in
exchange for the extraction?

25:20.520 --> 25:21.886
But how?

25:21.888 --> 25:23.554
Our system got breached
last night.

25:23.556 --> 25:25.556
While Wright was still
in prison with no Internet.

25:25.558 --> 25:27.692
And no access to the
outside world, for that matter.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.494
And besides,
how the hell would Wright know

25:29.496 --> 25:32.130
about any connection
between Toast and us?

25:32.132 --> 25:33.798
Plus, Toast's murder took place

25:33.800 --> 25:35.967
before we sprung Wright
from prison.

25:36.803 --> 25:39.971
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

25:39.973 --> 25:42.273
What if Wright
stole that CI list

25:42.275 --> 25:44.275
the first time
he breached our system?

25:44.277 --> 25:45.877
What, like an insurance policy?

25:45.879 --> 25:47.211
Exactly like
an insurance policy.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.347
Now we find ourselves
with no other option

25:49.349 --> 25:51.349
but to go to Wright for help.

25:51.351 --> 25:53.885
Because there's no more Toast.
Exactly.

25:53.887 --> 25:57.622
And he makes his help contingent
on us taking him out of Halawa,

25:57.624 --> 25:59.457
and he keeps the pressure on us

25:59.459 --> 26:01.826
by making sure all of
our other CIs are in jeopardy.

26:01.828 --> 26:02.827
Guy's a genius.

26:02.829 --> 26:04.629
This whole thing was a long con.

26:04.631 --> 26:06.364
Okay, but how does Mogera
fit in?

26:06.366 --> 26:08.366
I mean, Wright made it look like

26:08.368 --> 26:10.735
he was responsible
for the breach.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.970
And Mogera, he's just
going along with it? Why?

26:12.972 --> 26:15.406
I don't know, but if we want
to get Kamekona back,

26:15.408 --> 26:17.241
we need to find
Wright first, okay?

26:17.243 --> 26:19.410
And as it stands,
that blind hacker

26:19.412 --> 26:22.280
may be the only person
who can lead us to him.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.049
Hey! Guess who.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.618
I brought a friend this time.

26:31.558 --> 26:33.391
Mr. Taylor, my name
is Lieutenant Commander

26:33.393 --> 26:35.460
Steve McGarrett.
I run this task force.

26:35.462 --> 26:37.028
I got two words for you:

26:37.030 --> 26:38.096
Aaron Wright.

26:38.098 --> 26:39.464
He's got you
sitting in here

26:39.466 --> 26:41.265
taking the blame
for something he did.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.633
I don't understand that.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.902
All right,
either you desperately want

26:44.904 --> 26:47.004
the credit
for a ninja-level hack,

26:47.006 --> 26:49.607
or Mr. Wright has got
some serious leverage on you.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.509
I was warned bad things
would happen to me

26:51.511 --> 26:53.344
if I speak to you.

26:53.346 --> 26:54.312
Yeah? You don't remember

26:54.314 --> 26:56.347
what I told you
last time I was in here?

26:56.349 --> 26:59.350
Worry about us. Worse things
will happen to you if you don't.

26:59.352 --> 27:00.451
You should take that advice.

27:00.453 --> 27:02.520
Now, listen to me
very carefully.

27:02.522 --> 27:04.021
We can protect you

27:04.023 --> 27:06.524
from whatever Aaron Wright
has threatened you with,

27:06.526 --> 27:08.192
but you need
to help us find him,

27:08.194 --> 27:10.061
which means you tell us
everything you know,

27:10.063 --> 27:11.863
and you tell us right now.

27:14.067 --> 27:16.167
I'm sorry. Lou?
Was that not clear?

27:16.169 --> 27:18.903
This is
a limited-time offer.

27:18.905 --> 27:21.339
A man's life
is hanging in the balance,

27:21.341 --> 27:23.808
along with an
accessory-to-murder charge

27:23.810 --> 27:25.810
for your worthless ass.

27:25.812 --> 27:28.279
Wright contacted me
over the Dark Net.

27:28.281 --> 27:30.782
Said you guys
would come for me.

27:30.784 --> 27:33.651
He told me not to resist.

27:33.653 --> 27:35.887
Not to deny anything.

27:35.889 --> 27:37.722
All I had to do was...

27:37.724 --> 27:39.056
say nothing.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.258
He told me,

27:40.260 --> 27:43.294
if I did what he said,
you would just release me

27:43.296 --> 27:44.829
for lack of evidence.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.498
He needed a scapegoat
to buy him some time.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.900
What else?

27:48.902 --> 27:50.535
I don't consider myself
a criminal,

27:50.537 --> 27:51.669
but I've accessed

27:51.671 --> 27:53.137
government servers.

27:53.139 --> 27:56.207
Somehow,
Wright found out about that.

27:56.209 --> 27:59.343
He threatened to turn over
proof of my activities

27:59.345 --> 28:00.778
to the authorities.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.547
Look, I'm sorry
for whatever part I played

28:02.549 --> 28:04.115
in jeopardizing
your friend's life.

28:04.117 --> 28:07.552
I just didn't see
a way out of it.

28:07.554 --> 28:08.637
But I don't think
I can help you.

28:08.638 --> 28:09.308
Why not?

28:09.332 --> 28:11.426
I have no idea
where Wright is.

28:12.091 --> 28:13.958
You know, word on the street
is that you're

28:13.960 --> 28:15.593
some kind of hacker legend.
Is that right?

28:15.595 --> 28:18.896
I've been known to get around
a firewall or two.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.398
Good.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.768
Because you work for me now.

28:33.646 --> 28:35.613
Can he really do that?
Huh?

28:35.615 --> 28:36.948
Hack into Aaron Wright's cloud,

28:36.950 --> 28:39.150
just one e-mail
off the Dark Web?

28:39.152 --> 28:40.384
So he says.

28:40.386 --> 28:41.819
Right now, it's our best shot

28:41.821 --> 28:44.555
at figuring out who Wright
sold Kamekona out to.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.724
What's with you, Jerry?
You all right?

28:46.726 --> 28:50.027
Yeah. I'm just
a little blown away.

28:50.029 --> 28:52.230
We're in the presence
of greatness.

28:52.232 --> 28:53.965
Watching him on the keyboard
is like watching

28:53.967 --> 28:55.032
Mozart live in concert.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.535
Don't you mean Stevie Wonder?

29:00.273 --> 29:02.607
I'm in.
Wow. That was awesome.

29:02.609 --> 29:04.208
Let's take everybody
Wright has contacted

29:04.210 --> 29:05.710
and cross-reference it
with the list

29:05.712 --> 29:07.411
of everybody
Kamekona helped us put away.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.547
You got that list, right, Jerry?
Yeah.

29:16.256 --> 29:17.622
Winner.

29:17.624 --> 29:19.357
Joey Kang.

29:19.359 --> 29:20.958
I remember this guy.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.627
He was a major player
in the ice trade.

29:22.629 --> 29:24.629
He pled out
to a conspiracy charge.

29:24.631 --> 29:27.265
Did six years hard time.
You got a cell we can ping?

29:27.267 --> 29:29.200
Negative. Looks like he's been
laying low since he got out.

29:29.202 --> 29:30.668
Jerry, I want
you to pull up

29:30.670 --> 29:32.937
everything you can on this man
before he went away.

29:32.939 --> 29:35.439
Where he did business,
places he frequented,

29:35.441 --> 29:37.208
his family, known associates,
anything you got.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.743
Find me this guy.

29:38.745 --> 29:41.546
We need to find out
where he's holding Kamekona.

29:41.548 --> 29:43.981
We need to do it right now.

29:53.026 --> 29:54.425
Well?

29:54.427 --> 29:55.793
This is it.

29:55.795 --> 29:57.628
Last chance.

29:57.630 --> 29:59.730
You gonna tell me
where the money is?

30:00.567 --> 30:03.668
How many times can I say this?

30:03.670 --> 30:06.103
I spent it.

30:06.105 --> 30:09.106
I can't give you
what I don't have.

30:16.916 --> 30:19.650
You understand this means
I'm gonna kill you, right?

30:19.652 --> 30:23.387
I have no doubt
you're a man of your word.

30:23.389 --> 30:24.755
Either you're scared

30:24.757 --> 30:26.557
and you're doing
a good job hiding it,

30:26.559 --> 30:28.459
or you're just plain stupid.

30:28.461 --> 30:30.428
Let me tell
you something.

30:30.430 --> 30:33.831
I was just a lost kid

30:33.833 --> 30:37.635
trying to make it out
of Tent City.

30:37.637 --> 30:40.104
I took any shortcut I could.

30:40.106 --> 30:44.508
That path led me
straight to prison.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.178
I should've died there.

30:47.180 --> 30:49.080
But I didn't.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.383
Ever since I got out,

30:52.385 --> 30:55.820
just trying to live
my life right.

30:55.822 --> 30:58.422
Give back to the kids

30:58.424 --> 31:00.891
so they can make it like me.

31:00.893 --> 31:03.394
But most of all,

31:03.396 --> 31:08.633
I never took one single day
for granted.

31:11.204 --> 31:15.873
So, if you came
to take anything away from me,

31:15.875 --> 31:19.110
you're eight years too late.

31:19.112 --> 31:23.914
I never thought
I was gonna be here this long.

31:23.916 --> 31:27.118
Or live the life I live.

31:29.188 --> 31:31.389
Nobody...

31:31.391 --> 31:34.925
nobody can take that away
from me.

31:34.927 --> 31:37.261
You done?

31:37.263 --> 31:39.964
Yeah, bruddah.

31:39.966 --> 31:41.966
I'm done.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.768
Good.

31:48.241 --> 31:49.840
Untie him.

31:50.710 --> 31:52.576
We're going for a ride.

32:05.737 --> 32:07.136
Turn here.

32:10.408 --> 32:12.441
All right, Mr. Kang.

32:12.443 --> 32:14.610
Remember, four weeks ago,
there was a big wildfire?

32:16.681 --> 32:18.748
Almost took out half the island.
You remember that?

32:18.750 --> 32:21.284
The psycho that started
that fire...

32:21.286 --> 32:22.385
You can't do this!

32:22.387 --> 32:23.553
I already told you,

32:23.555 --> 32:25.121
I don't know
where my son is.

32:25.123 --> 32:27.657
He actually taught me something.

32:28.760 --> 32:31.027
Want to know what it was?

32:31.029 --> 32:32.695
That he taught me?

32:32.697 --> 32:34.630
Are you nuts?

32:35.667 --> 32:39.902
There's one thing
in this world...

32:39.904 --> 32:43.172
more than anything else
that can scare

32:43.174 --> 32:44.440
the truth out
of someone.

32:44.442 --> 32:47.810
You gonna guess
what that is?

32:47.812 --> 32:51.914
Now, I understand he's your boy,
you love him,

32:51.916 --> 32:52.882
you're gonna do whatever

32:52.884 --> 32:55.318
you have to do to
protect your family,

32:55.320 --> 32:59.088
but I'm gonna do whatever
I have to do to protect mine.

33:00.892 --> 33:03.526
Get Joey on the
phone, Mr. Kang.

33:05.930 --> 33:07.863
You have three seconds.

33:12.570 --> 33:14.537
Can I ask you
something?

33:14.539 --> 33:16.739
Let's say you're
telling the truth.

33:16.741 --> 33:18.708
Not that it
really matters.

33:18.710 --> 33:20.743
What'd you spend
my 500 grand on?

33:20.745 --> 33:23.846
You wouldn't believe it
if I told you.

33:41.866 --> 33:45.134
Hey. It's not really
a good time. Can I...

33:49.641 --> 33:51.707
I understand.

34:26.177 --> 34:28.911
Today's your lucky day.

35:26.304 --> 35:27.570
Hey.

35:29.073 --> 35:30.573
Uh...

35:30.575 --> 35:33.743
Commander McGarrett, uh...
why are you...

35:33.745 --> 35:35.811
How'd you find me here, sir?

35:35.813 --> 35:37.346
I've been calling the phone
I gave you.

35:37.348 --> 35:38.914
You don't answer it,
so I tracked it.

35:38.916 --> 35:40.349
Right.

35:40.351 --> 35:42.551
What the hell
are you doing here?

35:42.553 --> 35:44.220
You're a team guy. You...

35:44.222 --> 35:45.921
We got accommodations.
You understand?

35:45.923 --> 35:47.656
Nice, clean places
till you're squared.

35:47.658 --> 35:49.191
I know.

35:51.095 --> 35:53.596
All right.

35:53.598 --> 35:55.531
When I told you I wanted
to help you through

35:55.533 --> 35:57.333
whatever's going on
in your life, I meant it,

35:57.335 --> 35:58.834
but I gotta be able
to contact you.

35:58.836 --> 36:00.469
You understand?
Where's the phone I gave you?

36:00.471 --> 36:01.904
I don't know.

36:03.074 --> 36:04.774
You don't know
where the phone is?

36:04.776 --> 36:08.310
Most people in here
don't have a phone.

36:08.312 --> 36:10.880
I'm sorry, sir. I should have
taken better care of it.

36:13.718 --> 36:16.185
Oh, it doesn't...
it doesn't matter.

36:17.388 --> 36:19.755
Listen, kid,
pack your stuff up, all right?

36:19.757 --> 36:21.190
I'll be out the front.

36:21.192 --> 36:22.258
Sir?

36:22.260 --> 36:23.893
Until you graduate,

36:23.895 --> 36:25.261
you're staying with me,
all right?

36:25.263 --> 36:26.395
My house is your house.

36:26.397 --> 36:27.429
Pack your stuff.

36:27.431 --> 36:28.931
I'm in the truck out the front.

36:28.933 --> 36:30.766
Let's go.

36:37.775 --> 36:39.175
Aloha.

36:39.177 --> 36:43.112
Uh, sometimes in life,
you meet someone who's...

36:43.114 --> 36:45.848
a kindred spirit.

36:45.850 --> 36:49.685
Someone that you can laugh with,
sometimes at.

36:49.687 --> 36:53.455
And when you have that,
you should hold on to them

36:53.457 --> 36:55.291
and cherish your time together.

36:56.294 --> 36:58.427
'Cause when they're gone,

36:58.429 --> 37:00.996
you lose a little bit
of yourself.

37:00.998 --> 37:03.766
So, Toast, buddy...

37:03.768 --> 37:06.101

getting kidnapped.

37:50.915 --> 37:53.115
I'm celebrating survival, sista.

we'd see you again.

38:05.663 --> 38:07.463
You'll be sick of me
soon enough.

38:07.465 --> 38:10.399
Now that your truck
got barbecued,

38:10.401 --> 38:12.167
you'll be back working for me.

38:12.169 --> 38:13.335

Everybody, this is, uh...
this is my buddy Junior.

All right?
He's gonna be staying

38:33.624 --> 38:36.125
with me for a little while,
so... just make him feel

38:36.127 --> 38:37.159
at home, okay?

38:37.161 --> 38:38.794
Aloha.

38:38.796 --> 38:41.063
Good to see you again, kiddo.

38:41.065 --> 38:43.098
Hey, Junior, why don't
you go put your feet up.

38:43.100 --> 38:44.366
Take it easy, all right?

38:45.970 --> 38:47.870
- Glad you could make it.
- Yeah, man.

38:47.872 --> 38:49.371
What's the good word, buddy boy?

38:49.373 --> 38:51.407
Well, I spoke to Duke.

38:51.409 --> 38:53.709
Looks like Wright and Marks
are in the wind,

38:53.711 --> 38:56.145
but we picked up Joey Kang
down at the boat harbor,

38:56.147 --> 38:57.579
trying to get off the island.

38:57.581 --> 39:00.416
- Well, at least that's something.
- Yeah, we convinced him to stay.

39:01.585 --> 39:03.986
You ever hear, uh... you ever
hear back from Tani Rey?

39:03.988 --> 39:06.789
I told her we were meeting here,
but, uh...

39:06.791 --> 39:08.223
free country, bruddah.

39:08.225 --> 39:09.358
Yeah.

39:09.360 --> 39:11.193
She had a rough day.

39:11.195 --> 39:13.696
Maybe she decided to turn
in early, get some rest.

39:13.698 --> 39:14.897
Yeah, maybe. Yeah.

39:52.236 --> 39:53.635
Good boy.

39:53.637 --> 39:54.670
Go say hi.

39:54.672 --> 39:56.805
Go say hi.

39:56.807 --> 39:59.241
Hi. Hi.
He likes you.

39:59.243 --> 40:01.010
Not as much as he likes you.

40:01.012 --> 40:02.945
Ah, we're growing on each other.

40:02.947 --> 40:04.813
Hey. Hi.

40:04.815 --> 40:06.749
So you're keeping him?
It's kind of

40:06.751 --> 40:08.250
the other way around
at this stage.

40:08.252 --> 40:09.251
I...

40:09.253 --> 40:12.054
missed you at Tropics.

40:12.056 --> 40:14.556
Yeah, I just...

40:14.558 --> 40:16.125
didn't really want
to see anybody.

40:16.127 --> 40:17.493
Oh, is that your way

40:17.495 --> 40:19.928
of telling Ed and I
to take a hike?

40:19.930 --> 40:24.133
No, I... I appreciate you coming
to check on me, but...

40:24.135 --> 40:25.234
You're welcome. We're staying.

40:25.236 --> 40:27.269
Eddie, come here.

40:32.777 --> 40:34.510
It wasn't your fault, you know.

40:34.512 --> 40:35.911
Right.

40:35.913 --> 40:38.781
No, it wasn't.
If anything, it was mine.

40:38.783 --> 40:41.216
Why? For putting
the new girl in charge?

40:41.218 --> 40:46.255
No, for taking Wright out
of prison in the first place.

40:46.257 --> 40:49.091
It was a judgment call.
Turns out it was a bad one.

40:49.093 --> 40:51.193
But we all make mistakes.

40:51.195 --> 40:53.462
What are you gonna do, right?

40:53.464 --> 40:55.264
Learn from it and move on.

40:55.266 --> 40:58.367
I see what you're trying
to do here.

40:58.369 --> 41:00.169
Is it working?

41:00.171 --> 41:02.337
No.
Okay.

41:02.339 --> 41:04.473
Still not leaving.

41:06.610 --> 41:07.943
Listen.

41:07.945 --> 41:09.745
Here's the truth.

41:09.747 --> 41:11.046
I was distracted.

41:11.048 --> 41:14.583
My brother was texting me,
and I took my eye off the ball.

41:14.585 --> 41:16.485
Oh, so if you
weren't distracted,

41:16.487 --> 41:18.387
you could've taken out
three guys

41:18.389 --> 41:19.922
with flashbangs
and automatic weapons?

41:19.924 --> 41:21.890
I don't know.
Maybe I could've.

41:21.892 --> 41:24.026
Maybe? Okay.

41:24.028 --> 41:26.929
I just feel like...

41:28.332 --> 41:30.032
...after today, I'm wondering

41:30.034 --> 41:32.401
if I'm the right person
for the job.

41:32.403 --> 41:34.670
If you weren't,
you and I wouldn't be

41:34.672 --> 41:37.339
having this conversation
right now.

41:38.542 --> 41:40.542
Thank you.

41:40.544 --> 41:42.778
Yeah.

42:14.211 --> 42:16.245
Good job, guys. Water.

42:26.390 --> 42:28.490
Kamekona. How you been?

42:29.326 --> 42:30.993
Looking good, Eli.

42:30.995 --> 42:32.694
Haven't seen you around
here in a while.

42:32.696 --> 42:34.596
You know me--
I sell shrimp, but...

42:34.598 --> 42:36.999
I'm like a shark.
I'm always moving.

42:37.835 --> 42:39.168
Still, I had
to come in

42:39.170 --> 42:42.037
and stop by and see the <i>keikis.</i>

42:42.039 --> 42:44.173
Place looks good.

42:44.175 --> 42:45.507
Yeah, it does.

42:45.509 --> 42:47.643
Everyone pitches in on the upkeep.

42:48.879 --> 42:51.346
Anyway, good to see you.

42:51.348 --> 42:53.448
You should come around
more often.

42:53.450 --> 42:55.184
You know you're always
welcome here.

42:55.186 --> 42:57.252
