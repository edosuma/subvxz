- Really?

47:59.920 --> 48:02.140
- It helps me think.
It's complex carbs.

48:02.227 --> 48:03.881
Please respect the process.

48:03.968 --> 48:05.665
- The carbs could not
be simpler.

48:05.752 --> 48:07.580
But you know what? You do you.

48:07.667 --> 48:10.191

I think I will.

to get somewhere.

48:32.518 --> 48:36.391
- Yes. I have an audition
for a Broadway musical.

48:36.478 --> 48:38.089
- Well, okay.

48:38.176 --> 48:40.918
Broadway is in New York City,
so that's a start.

48:41.005 --> 48:41.570
Let's go.

48:45.357 --> 48:47.576
- Okay, where can I take you?

48:47.663 --> 48:50.710
- Oh. A theater. That was
the answer to Blue's Clues.

48:50.797 --> 48:53.539
- Great. So what theater?

48:53.626 --> 48:55.410
- What theater?

48:55.497 --> 49:00.502
Oh. Okay. Well, it has a stage,
rainbow curtains, and a piano.

49:00.589 --> 49:02.504
- Sounds fancy.
But where is it?

49:02.591 --> 49:04.637
- Oh. Well.

49:05.725 --> 49:08.902
- We don't know exactly.

49:08.989 --> 49:10.121
- Let me get this straight.

49:10.208 --> 49:12.297
You came to
New York City from...

49:12.384 --> 49:15.996
- Storybook World.
- Storybook World. Right.

49:16.083 --> 49:17.824
Makes sense.

49:17.911 --> 49:20.914
And now, you are following your
dream to a Broadway audition.

49:21.001 --> 49:23.395
- Yes! And it's almost- 00.

49:23.482 --> 49:26.050
- But you don't know
where the theater is?

49:26.137 --> 49:27.747
- No.

49:27.834 --> 49:29.705
- Well, all right.

49:29.792 --> 49:31.838
Sometimes you just need
to have a little patience.

49:31.925 --> 49:34.362
- Patience?
- What I always say.

49:34.449 --> 49:37.365
You have to have patience

of taking you

49:39.324 --> 49:41.239
on the adventure
you need to go on.

49:41.326 --> 49:44.764
- Life is an adventure.
- Now you're getting it.

49:44.851 --> 49:46.374
Okay.

49:46.461 --> 49:49.595
So how about a little
New York City adventure?

49:49.682 --> 49:51.379
- All right!

49:51.466 --> 49:54.687
- Now, Lombardi's has
the best pizza.

49:54.774 --> 49:57.864
Arguably, Joe's Pizza
has classic New York pizza.

50:00.432 --> 50:01.476
- Stop!

50:03.000 --> 50:04.958

Wait. We were there,
with the big balloon message.

50:20.234 --> 50:22.410
- Yeah, but then
all the balloons deflated.

- How else would you get
to the theater?

51:06.585 --> 51:09.109
- Wow, you guys are the best!

He's got heart, he's got soul,
and he's got a dream. Like me.

51:39.618 --> 51:43.883
