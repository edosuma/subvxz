00:00.008 --> 00:02.223
Previously on Spotless...

00:03.192 --> 00:04.455
I want you

00:04.497 --> 00:06.771
to make it look like suicide.

00:10.130 --> 00:13.835
Do you realise you guys just
wasted a pretty senior cop?

00:13.877 --> 00:16.168
Mate, we are too big to fail.

00:17.033 --> 00:18.845
Sorry. I'm sure my husband
will be here any minute.

00:18.878 --> 00:19.670
See you later.

00:21.122 --> 00:21.910
Madam.

00:21.931 --> 00:23.211
I do apologize.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.810
It has been a bitch of a morning.

00:25.865 --> 00:27.610
I think this is going very well.

00:27.670 --> 00:29.975
You can take your hand off my arse now.

00:30.015 --> 00:32.259
- Sorry.
- He's around here.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.790
I can smell him.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.456
Spending our money.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.504
This could kill you.

00:38.531 --> 00:40.876
- Where is it?
- I flushed it down the toilet.

00:43.597 --> 00:44.384
What is it?

00:44.444 --> 00:45.602
I think he's a cop.

00:45.662 --> 00:47.316
You know he was under investigation.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.507
I had heard.

00:48.761 --> 00:50.427
It can be a brave way out, suicide.

00:50.459 --> 00:51.434
Bollocks.

03:48.600 --> 03:49.981
What are you doing here?

03:50.920 --> 03:52.280
Confession.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.816
Tuesdays, Thursdays, Sunday afternoons.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.424
I came here to see you.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.086
Julie thinks you're out drinking.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.914
Don't worry, I won't tell her.

04:07.276 --> 04:09.137
Ruin your legend.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.827
With all due respect to my surroundings,

04:14.360 --> 04:15.513
fuck you.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.420
I thought you didn't believe in God.

04:20.959 --> 04:21.927
I don't.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.269
It's just mythology.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.905
I like churches though.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.071
I like the peace.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.124
Why did you stay?

04:39.840 --> 04:41.280
I can go if you want.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.463
That's not what I asked.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.253
I'm scared you know.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.556
It's not just you and me anymore.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.483
There's Julie, the kids.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.257
These guys in our lives...

05:13.880 --> 05:15.577
I have no control.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.477
You can't always control everything.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.090
Life doesn't work that way.

05:31.240 --> 05:32.993
Do you ever think about him?

05:34.323 --> 05:35.880
Who, Jesus ?

05:36.960 --> 05:38.862
No, the guy we killed.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.816
He had a wife and kids.

05:45.869 --> 05:48.151
We changed their lives forever.

06:09.396 --> 06:10.499
I have to go.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.607
Do you have more karate stuff?

06:13.800 --> 06:15.400
It's kickboxing!

06:15.600 --> 06:17.800
And no, I've got a hot date.

06:20.600 --> 06:21.665
That's cool.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.160
I know it is.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.482
How far would you go to
protect someone you love?

06:39.280 --> 06:40.882
Wherever it takes.

06:42.280 --> 06:43.779
If it's illegal?

06:45.880 --> 06:47.518
If people get hurt?

06:49.200 --> 06:50.600
What kind of trouble are you in?

06:51.200 --> 06:52.470
The worst.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.348
Some people died.

06:59.602 --> 07:01.168
But you didn't kill anybody.

07:01.775 --> 07:04.006
No. I wouldn't do that.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.641
- Can you get out of it?
- I'm trying.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.144
But they won't let you?

07:20.760 --> 07:22.079
You're a good guy.

07:22.760 --> 07:24.311
But if you're dealing with bad guys,

07:24.319 --> 07:27.174
you have to be prepared
to do whatever it takes.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.978
Do you really have a hot date?

07:35.760 --> 07:38.476
I'm meeting my mom
today. She's having chemo.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.855
How is she?

07:46.920 --> 07:48.160
She's strong.

08:10.122 --> 08:11.074
This is a waste of time.

08:11.082 --> 08:14.189
There's like 8 millions people in
London, and you want to go door to door?

08:14.190 --> 08:16.632
Maybe you could cut up some more
people with your knife, I mean,

08:16.674 --> 08:18.560
that worked so well for us before.

08:18.680 --> 08:20.034
My turn.

08:20.548 --> 08:21.828
Hey.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.632
I'm looking for this guy.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.260
He kidnapped my sister's
baby. Custody thing, you know?

08:27.280 --> 08:28.680
Nah, sorry, mate.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.280
Kidnapped?

08:31.285 --> 08:34.022
Yeah, if we invent a
story, it passes the time,

08:34.030 --> 08:35.488
it keeps the interest up.

08:48.498 --> 08:49.307
It's great.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.942
It's a shitty old dump.

08:52.995 --> 08:55.134
But it's my shitty old dump.

08:55.546 --> 08:56.725
Oh for fuck's sake.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.000
Get a room.

08:58.480 --> 09:01.786
Actually, scrap that, why
don't you just mount him here,

09:01.819 --> 09:04.085
in amongst the turpentine
and wood shavings.

09:04.120 --> 09:06.920
Oh, don't tempt me! I fucking
love this amount of sawdust.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.549
Yeah, wood is like some
kind of aphrodisiac for her.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.909
As delightfully grubby as that
sounds, I need to get to work.

09:13.389 --> 09:14.416
Hey.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.680
Thank you.

09:17.263 --> 09:19.115
Shut up and make a chair.

09:23.796 --> 09:25.834
You're an awesome sister-in-law.

09:25.880 --> 09:27.485
I can only agree.

09:40.090 --> 09:41.280
Happy?

09:42.591 --> 09:43.938
Yeah.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.600
Yeah I think I am.

10:17.048 --> 10:18.344
Oh fuck.

10:19.640 --> 10:20.626
Where's Maureen?

10:20.627 --> 10:22.194
I don't know who that is.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.190
We gave you a phone.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.080
Yeah, it's in a drawer at home.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.733
Well, that'd be why you don't
hear us when we call. And, um,

10:31.040 --> 10:32.600
we have been calling.

10:35.281 --> 10:38.560
I can't... always be available.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.786
You know what.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.692
Your brother said exactly the same thing.

11:25.901 --> 11:27.703
Thanks for coming so quickly.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.453
Let me introduce you

11:32.573 --> 11:34.626
to Andrew St. John-Paine.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.682
Candidate for deputy mayor

11:37.725 --> 11:39.165
of this fierce city.

11:39.680 --> 11:43.920
Four terms counselor for the borough
of Croydon, rising political star...

11:45.520 --> 11:47.520
A very dear friend of mine.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.910
What's wrong with him?

11:57.465 --> 11:58.719
Come with me.

12:16.117 --> 12:17.818
- That's not good.
- No.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.958
Her name was Joanna.

12:21.396 --> 12:23.426
High-end. Nice girl.

12:23.771 --> 12:25.691
I've known her a decade probably.

12:25.733 --> 12:28.120
Well, knew her.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.240
What killed her?

12:34.383 --> 12:36.075
- Drugs.
- Heroin.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.960
Yeah, she OD-ed.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.924
That's Paine's story.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.880
They partied for a while, had sex,

12:43.000 --> 12:44.488
partied some more.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.082
She suggested they speedball.

12:47.309 --> 12:50.416
He declined. She went ahead,
shot up in the bathroom.

12:51.640 --> 12:55.394
Came back a little wasted,
but you know, still...

12:56.080 --> 12:57.320
game.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.337
A little heavy petting and she just...

13:01.320 --> 13:02.501
went.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.200
He thought she was asleep.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.954
Well, he might be telling the truth.

13:10.726 --> 13:12.756
I don't see any signs of struggle.

13:15.440 --> 13:16.984
What do you want from us?

13:19.940 --> 13:22.677
Joanna was Paine's date at an
official function last night.

13:24.387 --> 13:27.999
He's married. Three kids: 4,
7 and 10, two boys and a girl.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.091
They've been seen together,

13:31.440 --> 13:33.423
photographed, CCTV.

13:33.543 --> 13:36.207
If she's found dead here, and he's
implicated, then he's finished.

13:38.740 --> 13:42.034
Must be pretty useful to have a
politician who owes you his life.

13:42.641 --> 13:44.514
Nobody likes it. But it is what it is.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.269
We have to look to the future.

13:48.219 --> 13:50.348
So what do you want? You
want us to clean the room,

13:50.853 --> 13:53.488
get rid of the body because
your brother owns this flat?

13:54.200 --> 13:56.823
I let my friends entertain here.

13:58.359 --> 14:00.663
No, if she disappears,
someone will miss her,

14:01.297 --> 14:04.018
and your friend will still be
the last one to see her alive.

14:05.090 --> 14:07.057
I want you to fix it.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.466
She's not a criminal,

14:11.000 --> 14:12.116
or a killer,

14:12.446 --> 14:14.880
- or a tough guy.
- I know.

14:15.613 --> 14:17.215
She's somebody's daughter.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.772
Who are you mourning for?

14:21.062 --> 14:21.897
The girl?

14:24.201 --> 14:25.600
Yourself?

14:28.800 --> 14:30.733
I have to ask him some questions.

14:37.268 --> 14:39.774
I need you to answer fully and honestly.

14:40.131 --> 14:40.960
Of course.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.085
Look at me.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.407
- You had sex with the girl last night?
- Yes.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.422
Did you wear a condom?

14:49.810 --> 14:51.720
- Yes.
- The whole time?

14:52.036 --> 14:53.060
Yes.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.120
You didn't deposit any
bodily fluids inside her?

14:56.726 --> 14:57.925
No.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.640
- In her mouth?
- Are you getting off on that.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.838
A woman died here.

15:05.842 --> 15:08.085
And listen, I don't like
this any more than you.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.779
But I need to know exactly what happened,

15:10.899 --> 15:12.032
every detail.

15:15.009 --> 15:16.552
Did she suck your cock?

15:16.579 --> 15:18.566
- Fucking hell!
- Did she?

15:18.862 --> 15:19.765
No.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.893
Did you go down on her?

15:22.379 --> 15:24.312
- No.
- Anal sex?

15:24.635 --> 15:26.630
- You on her, her on you?
- No.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.495
He's a traditional kind of guy.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.564
Why is she restrained?

15:30.954 --> 15:32.362
It was her idea.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.660
Joanna was very sexual.

15:34.673 --> 15:36.320
- She liked...
- I don't need to know that.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.110
Did you use the heroin?

15:40.769 --> 15:43.713
I... I did a couple lines
of coke to be social, but...

15:44.535 --> 15:46.260
I'm not into hard drugs.

15:54.439 --> 15:55.793
Did she live alone?

15:58.899 --> 16:00.381
I believe she did, yes.

16:01.500 --> 16:04.161
OK. Well, we can move her, to her home,

16:04.920 --> 16:07.400
clean every trace of your "good friend",

16:08.027 --> 16:09.819
I'll stage her death as just...

16:10.000 --> 16:11.692
another drug's casualty.

16:12.360 --> 16:13.679
You can do that?

16:14.280 --> 16:15.714
Not perfectly.

16:16.360 --> 16:19.049
Maybe enough to give the appearance of it.

16:19.656 --> 16:21.704
Leading the investigators towards a

16:21.939 --> 16:23.394
preferred conclusion.

16:24.294 --> 16:25.937
And you'll clean this apartment.

16:26.370 --> 16:27.251
Yeah.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.656
I need my gear.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.703
Joey and I will stay, help out.

16:38.469 --> 16:39.598
No.

16:42.680 --> 16:43.749
I want him

16:43.869 --> 16:44.900
to do it.

16:46.259 --> 16:49.678
He's got some ground to make up, Joey.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.881
He can start here.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.359
I'm so grateful.

17:06.599 --> 17:08.374
- I had no idea...
- Be quiet.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.705
I loathe you.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.209
And now I own you.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.352
You better have a very long

17:25.680 --> 17:28.520
and a very successful career.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.731
I have a bad feeling about this.

17:49.080 --> 17:51.070
This is not a nice situation.

17:51.088 --> 17:54.507
What we're trying to do
forensically, it's fucking nuts!

17:56.200 --> 17:57.657
What do you want me to do?

17:57.777 --> 18:01.286
Well, Padraig and Rosie, they're on a job,

18:01.406 --> 18:03.964
at the morgue, South Ken Hospital.

18:04.672 --> 18:07.703
It's a regular contract. I'm
supposed to be there, but...

18:08.440 --> 18:10.045
I think you should go instead.

18:12.040 --> 18:14.045
If everything goes well, then great, but...

18:15.578 --> 18:16.984
if it doesn't,

18:17.760 --> 18:20.058
at least one of us will stay alive,

18:20.440 --> 18:22.070
and not go to jail.

18:26.163 --> 18:28.268
- Hello?
- Mrs Bastière?

18:28.302 --> 18:31.123
- Speaking.
- It's Marcella Collins, at St. Bart's,

18:31.173 --> 18:32.580
Madeleine's form teacher.

18:32.622 --> 18:34.719
Yes, hello Miss Collins.

18:35.013 --> 18:38.685
Madeleine attended registration this
morning, but none of her classes since.

18:39.274 --> 18:42.289
We haven't received a letter
from you regretting an absence.

18:42.608 --> 18:43.745
No...

18:44.400 --> 18:45.951
So she is truanting?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.655
Maddy is a bit unsettled.

18:48.680 --> 18:51.880
This is her last week with you.
She starts at Kings Gate on Monday.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.449
Yes, that is unfortunate.

18:55.240 --> 18:58.777
What would you suggest I do?
Comb the streets looking for her?

18:59.594 --> 19:01.910
Are any of her friends absent?

19:01.927 --> 19:04.100
No, it seems to be just Madeleine.

19:04.220 --> 19:06.896
And I have to say, it's
not entirely a shock.

19:07.452 --> 19:09.607
Has it been long Miss Collins?

19:09.727 --> 19:11.240
Um... I'm sorry?

19:11.477 --> 19:14.735
Since you got laid. Because the
general consensus in our household

19:14.740 --> 19:16.465
is that you really need it.

19:44.953 --> 19:47.239
Right there, next to her.

19:53.991 --> 19:55.527
A little bit closer.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.258
Yeah, that's good.

20:02.259 --> 20:04.000
I've known her since she was 19.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.803
Beautiful kid.

20:07.617 --> 20:09.768
- Did she always do drugs?
- No.

20:09.888 --> 20:13.152
Only since she started to fuck
scumbags like St. John-Paine.

20:15.307 --> 20:17.134
We'll give her a decent death.

20:19.600 --> 20:20.761
So what now?

20:21.807 --> 20:24.590
Well, we wanna disturb the
body as little as possible.

21:36.598 --> 21:37.935
Slowly! Slowly!

21:39.680 --> 21:40.683
Follow me.

21:56.049 --> 21:59.565
- Buy two things?
- Have enough? All right.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.465
I'm looking for this guy.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.313
He has amnesia.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.460
Wears a rose in his buttonhole.

22:08.153 --> 22:09.320
No, sorry.

22:09.440 --> 22:10.751
Ask your friend.

22:12.044 --> 22:13.381
Have you seen this guy?

22:13.607 --> 22:14.539
No.

22:16.040 --> 22:16.760
No.

22:17.132 --> 22:19.024
- We're busy.
- Go fuck yourself.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.885
He's a charming guy, my friend.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.598
Do you understand me? My accent?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.371
I mean, I'm French.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.968
Not everybody in France
is so nasty, like him.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.747
Don't let it put you off.

22:35.560 --> 22:36.824
You don't talk much, uh?

22:38.120 --> 22:40.236
Why are you looking for
the man in the photograph?

22:40.252 --> 22:42.800
He's a thief, you know. A robber.

22:45.157 --> 22:47.378
He stole some pretty important things

22:47.550 --> 22:48.760
from a big museum.

22:49.043 --> 22:50.838
That's why my friend is so angry.

22:51.200 --> 22:51.926
In fact,

22:52.659 --> 22:54.492
he's had lots of reasons why he's so angry.

22:54.546 --> 22:55.996
That's just one of them.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.306
You shouldn't stare, kid.

23:00.520 --> 23:01.708
It's a bad habit.

23:03.426 --> 23:04.310
Tchao.

23:15.480 --> 23:16.435
Wait here.

24:57.098 --> 24:58.058
So what now?

24:58.688 --> 25:02.062
Well, the best thing to do is
skip your DNA off the premises.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.929
If I need you, I'll call.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.718
We're supposed to help you.

25:06.838 --> 25:07.737
Yeah.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.194
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

25:10.221 --> 25:12.393
Clean, and set the scene.

25:14.680 --> 25:15.971
I think I should stay.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.240
Knock yourself out.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.138
In the car.

25:24.612 --> 25:25.954
I'll get my stuff.

25:26.374 --> 25:28.244
- How long are you gonna be?
- What?

25:28.303 --> 25:29.861
Just... listen,

25:30.422 --> 25:31.193
I'm...

25:31.920 --> 25:34.083
I'm sorry, right, 'cause you know,

25:34.203 --> 25:35.947
I'm the one who got you
involved in all this.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.895
It has no happy ending.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.600
Look at what he did to fucking Kendrick.

25:42.010 --> 25:43.988
You know, he knew the man for 20 years.

25:44.305 --> 25:47.534
He took him to the racing, to
restaurants, his wife and family.

25:48.450 --> 25:49.851
- You pulled the trigger.
- Yeah.

25:50.040 --> 25:50.989
I did.

25:51.689 --> 25:53.403
And you see how he treats me now.

25:55.198 --> 25:56.546
I'm making plans.

25:58.040 --> 25:59.321
You should too.

26:09.285 --> 26:12.830
Oh, fucking students, always
leave the place in a state.

26:12.831 --> 26:15.310
Well, it's probably good that
they get to practice though,

26:15.430 --> 26:18.280
before they start slicing up live people.

26:18.960 --> 26:22.040
- I thought they cleaned this shit up as they go.
- Yeah, they do.

26:22.040 --> 26:25.462
But once a week, we get
the joy of a deep clean.

27:00.640 --> 27:01.488
Ready?

27:45.926 --> 27:47.248
Hey!

28:05.992 --> 28:07.163
Hello?

28:07.440 --> 28:09.320
Mrs Julie Bastière?

28:09.560 --> 28:12.578
Yeah. Sorry, if you're selling
anything, I'm really not interested.

28:12.698 --> 28:16.300
This is the custody sergeant at
West End Central Police Station.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.408
Yes, hello sir, this is Mrs Bastière.

28:19.600 --> 28:22.490
I believe we have your
daughter, Madeleine, with us.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.778
- Oy, what the fuck is he doing?
- Shut up.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.656
- We're meant to be keeping an eye.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.440
Yeah, you fucking prick.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.016
Is this a new thing?

33:07.288 --> 33:08.315
Hmm?

33:09.120 --> 33:10.521
Shoplifting?

33:23.853 --> 33:25.920
Well, I bet that hurts.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.537
Is this about changing schools?

33:31.200 --> 33:33.015
Maddy, do you not want to go to Kings Gate?

33:33.040 --> 33:35.019
It's you who wants it, not me.

33:37.760 --> 33:39.299
Well, you won't believe
me when I tell you this,

33:39.305 --> 33:41.676
but actually, it's your
dad's idea to change schools.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.697
He never had a chance at an education.

33:46.134 --> 33:47.567
He wants the best for you.

33:47.982 --> 33:49.314
Some parents believe

33:49.751 --> 33:52.946
that a good education is the best
gift a parent can give a child.

33:53.291 --> 33:54.175
Do you?

33:55.680 --> 33:57.596
Well, better to have it than not.

33:59.968 --> 34:01.822
And changing schools,

34:02.296 --> 34:05.428
It's a... an opportunity, you
know, you can reinvent yourself.

34:05.680 --> 34:07.513
You can be anything you want to be.

34:08.893 --> 34:11.000
- Do I have to go back to St. Bart's.
- No.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.887
I think you're done with St. Bart's.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.985
I told your form teacher
she needed to get laid.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.021
She really does.

34:25.496 --> 34:26.679
Come here.

34:39.880 --> 34:42.195
- Well, I'm gonna have a cigarette.
- You can't smoke in here.

34:42.793 --> 34:43.560
Outside.

34:46.234 --> 34:47.429
Do you want a coffee?

34:48.437 --> 34:49.127
Yeah.

34:49.826 --> 34:51.684
Can I borrow money from you?

34:53.188 --> 34:55.779
There's some petty cash in the
van under the passenger seat,

34:55.800 --> 34:57.499
but bring me a receipt.

34:57.668 --> 34:58.388
Right.

34:58.918 --> 34:59.806
I knew that.

35:05.563 --> 35:06.520
This guy!

35:11.879 --> 35:14.656
Excuse me sir, you can't
do that in here. Excuse me!

35:14.678 --> 35:16.066
Please, excuse me.

35:17.273 --> 35:18.200
Thank you.

35:29.913 --> 35:31.000
Excuse me?

35:31.520 --> 35:32.690
Can I have one of those?

35:41.080 --> 35:42.020
Got a light?

35:47.920 --> 35:48.776
Thanks.

35:56.416 --> 35:57.976
So, if you had to count,

35:58.442 --> 35:59.615
How many women

35:59.964 --> 36:01.581
would you say you had sex with?

36:02.440 --> 36:03.193
One.

36:03.920 --> 36:04.612
One?

36:05.042 --> 36:05.857
My wife.

36:06.435 --> 36:08.375
Every night for 35 years.

36:08.397 --> 36:09.427
- Never miss.
- Shit.

36:09.432 --> 36:12.087
Why are we wasting our time
at the fucking hospital?

36:18.390 --> 36:20.607
- I'll see you around, buddy.
- Maybe not.

36:22.215 --> 36:23.548
He's here, go!

36:25.798 --> 36:27.889
- Open the door!
- Open that fucking door!

36:27.915 --> 36:28.682
Putain !

37:16.322 --> 37:17.219
Shit!

37:23.484 --> 37:24.838
Oy! Wanker!

37:35.400 --> 37:37.082
Watch where you're fucking going!

37:49.376 --> 37:51.506
Shit! Fucking leg!

38:03.401 --> 38:05.444
Fucking leg! Fucking leg!

38:07.360 --> 38:09.575
You, fucking idiot!

38:10.235 --> 38:11.368
You fucking idiot.

38:11.735 --> 38:13.217
What do you want? You stole from me.

38:13.235 --> 38:14.972
It's poker. Everybody
steals from everybody.

38:14.985 --> 38:15.999
Where are the drugs?

38:16.714 --> 38:18.646
- What drugs?
- The... the girl has them.

38:18.809 --> 38:20.289
- What girl?
- The drug mule.

38:20.517 --> 38:22.259
- Where is she?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

38:24.209 --> 38:25.688
Where are my drugs?

38:25.908 --> 38:26.753
Fuck off!

38:26.783 --> 38:29.124
They're not your drugs.
You're a fucking lap dog.

38:30.689 --> 38:33.060
Before I kill you, and I will kill you,

38:33.065 --> 38:35.005
you're gonna tell me where my drugs are.

38:36.005 --> 38:37.320
OK, OK, I fucked her!

38:37.545 --> 38:39.032
- I fucked her and then she died.
- What?

38:39.050 --> 38:39.774
Yeah.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.629
I tried to sell the drugs,

38:44.749 --> 38:46.194
to a guy called Nelson Clay.

38:47.600 --> 38:48.905
He's a big guy here.

38:49.531 --> 38:51.480
He lied. He took the drugs, never paid!

38:51.600 --> 38:53.109
And when I told him about you guys,

38:53.187 --> 38:55.170
he... he laughed at me!

38:55.381 --> 38:57.545
I swear! Oh, fuck!

38:58.747 --> 38:59.670
Nelson Clay?

39:02.050 --> 39:02.969
Shit!

39:03.141 --> 39:04.098
Grab him!

39:07.000 --> 39:07.867
Where is he?

39:08.496 --> 39:10.617
- I think he went under.
- Go in.

39:11.221 --> 39:13.463
- What?
- I... I got a little bit of vertigo.

39:13.476 --> 39:16.209
- Jump in, find him.
- You jump in, you fucking lunatic!

39:55.323 --> 39:56.080
Fuck!

39:57.738 --> 40:00.415
- What the fuck you're doing?
- I thought... I thought you'd gone.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.813
She's still a fucking person!

40:02.826 --> 40:04.231
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

40:04.262 --> 40:05.646
You're fucking sick!

40:06.426 --> 40:08.267
Hey, hey, what's all the noise?

40:08.332 --> 40:09.737
- Fuck.
- Get Nelson!

40:09.896 --> 40:11.254
No, no, no, please! Please, no!

40:11.280 --> 40:12.854
- Call him!
- No, fuck...

40:13.449 --> 40:16.376
Please! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

40:28.379 --> 40:29.668
It was a mistake.

40:29.918 --> 40:33.220
Get your fucking hand
off my arm immediately.

41:02.843 --> 41:03.722
Do you want something?

41:05.373 --> 41:05.960
No.

41:18.240 --> 41:19.360
What are the options?

41:21.200 --> 41:22.396
There's no options.

41:22.887 --> 41:24.530
His DNA is inside her, and,

41:24.578 --> 41:25.677
I can't fix that.

41:27.337 --> 41:28.863
We have to burn the place.

41:29.902 --> 41:31.519
There'll be a fire investigation.

41:31.790 --> 41:32.407
Yeah, but,

41:32.579 --> 41:34.821
but they girl's body won't
give off any evidence.

41:37.800 --> 41:38.843
Victor

41:39.520 --> 41:40.580
married young.

41:41.560 --> 41:42.546
18.

41:43.723 --> 41:45.160
She was a lovely girl.

41:45.478 --> 41:47.298
Best thing that ever happened to him.

41:48.612 --> 41:49.940
Being my younger brother,

41:50.686 --> 41:52.631
he had a certain licence

41:52.855 --> 41:54.093
to behave badly,

41:54.589 --> 41:55.564
which he did.

41:57.202 --> 41:58.793
Finally, she decided

41:59.548 --> 42:02.122
after, 7, 8 years,

42:02.200 --> 42:03.195
to leave him.

42:04.363 --> 42:07.105
He came back after a
3-day binder, still wild.

42:07.398 --> 42:09.412
Her bags were packed. She was good to go.

42:11.102 --> 42:12.577
And she wouldn't be talked around.

42:15.789 --> 42:16.944
So he killed her.

42:18.707 --> 42:20.036
With his fists.

42:23.779 --> 42:25.387
The next morning, sober,

42:25.891 --> 42:27.440
he can't believe

42:27.801 --> 42:29.836
he's killed the only
thing that mattered to him.

42:30.879 --> 42:32.715
His one chance at a good life.

42:33.939 --> 42:35.746
So, grief-stricken,

42:36.022 --> 42:37.949
he carries her up to the marital bed...

42:38.560 --> 42:39.514
Jeez.

42:40.385 --> 42:41.790
... And tries to

42:42.187 --> 42:44.015
"love" her back to life.

42:46.740 --> 42:49.051
It was 7 days before
I went looking for him.

42:49.486 --> 42:50.538
He's sick.

42:51.470 --> 42:52.828
Yes, he is.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.751
As far as I'm aware,

42:55.600 --> 42:57.243
it hasn't happened since.

42:57.566 --> 42:58.541
You believe that?

43:00.145 --> 43:01.287
Yes, I do.

43:05.405 --> 43:06.840
And he will never,

43:07.360 --> 43:08.680
do it again.

43:34.280 --> 43:36.635
Oh, hell, fuck.

43:37.234 --> 43:38.480
Come on, come on.

43:38.520 --> 43:40.038
Here you go.

43:40.922 --> 43:42.120
Shit!

43:53.537 --> 43:56.120
- Fuck!
- We're working against the clock.

43:56.240 --> 43:58.160
We'll have to take it with us now.

43:58.480 --> 44:00.055
Well, it's a murdered cat!

44:00.320 --> 44:02.741
Aren't we trying not to draw attention?

44:05.115 --> 44:07.894
I'll... I'll get the cat, boss.

44:36.417 --> 44:38.235
Your brother might be home.

44:41.090 --> 44:42.825
- Hi.
- Hey.

44:43.150 --> 44:44.492
Hey.

44:50.319 --> 44:52.037
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

44:52.520 --> 44:54.041
Well, you're soaking wet.

45:09.830 --> 45:11.413
Shouldn't you be in the hospital?

45:13.080 --> 45:14.251
I can't.

45:20.432 --> 45:22.832
All right, Maddy, go to my bathroom, and

45:22.840 --> 45:26.133
take all the cotton pads you can
find, disinfectant, antiseptic,

45:26.150 --> 45:28.524
anything you can carry, OK? OK, go.

45:40.840 --> 45:42.603
Should we be worried about you?

45:43.040 --> 45:44.591
Don't worry about me.

45:46.284 --> 45:47.412
Us?

45:49.480 --> 45:51.228
I would never hurt you guys.

46:10.200 --> 46:13.600
OK, I'm gonna try and find
a bandage. Maddy, come here.

46:13.789 --> 46:16.215
I need you to put
pressure on the wound, OK?

46:17.478 --> 46:18.405
OK.

46:18.784 --> 46:20.022
Real pressure.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.003
You can press harder.

46:31.280 --> 46:32.627
Are you OK?

46:33.680 --> 46:34.732
I'm OK.

46:35.221 --> 46:36.753
I can feel your heart.

46:37.772 --> 46:38.918
That's good.

46:41.512 --> 46:43.726
- Hey, big man.
- Hey.

46:46.680 --> 46:48.055
What happened?

46:50.952 --> 46:53.150
Did the French guys get you?

47:16.034 --> 47:18.013
Scallions weren't ready yet.

47:18.320 --> 47:20.825
I thought you'd rather do
without than pick them early.

47:22.320 --> 47:23.638
Good call.

47:32.480 --> 47:33.617
Bok choy,

47:33.960 --> 47:37.080
rainbow chards, baby carrots, broad beans.

47:37.305 --> 47:39.772
All fresh. Take them home to the wife.

47:44.193 --> 47:45.734
I'll take the cat.

47:48.120 --> 47:49.532
Give me the cat.

47:53.035 --> 47:55.418
Apparently it's an old wives' tale, but

47:55.760 --> 47:58.960
burying them in the allotments
stops the others coming around,

47:59.360 --> 48:01.600
shitting all over the place.

48:03.367 --> 48:04.689
Bonsoir.

48:51.728 --> 48:53.210
Hey.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.738
I missed you today.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.200
Are you OK?

49:12.520 --> 49:14.938
Shitty day. Shitty job.

49:15.680 --> 49:17.355
Listen, you're not the only one.

49:17.549 --> 49:19.073
I think your brother's really hurt.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.190
Who did that?

49:39.160 --> 49:41.801
The guys, from St-Nazaire.

49:43.274 --> 49:44.630
What happened?

49:45.640 --> 49:47.350
One of them stabbed me.

49:48.880 --> 49:50.912
But don't worry, it's clean.

49:53.520 --> 49:55.830
Do they know you're in my house?

49:58.440 --> 50:00.748
If they did, they would have come already.

50:02.542 --> 50:03.939
But they will come, right?

50:10.840 --> 50:12.369
That's why I came back.

50:15.760 --> 50:18.238
It wouldn't be fair just
to leave you with it.

50:27.518 --> 50:29.674
God, this weed is strong.

50:30.878 --> 50:32.160
Give me that.

50:46.960 --> 50:49.816
Nelson's brother fucked a dead girl today.

50:52.600 --> 50:54.667
I had to burn the body.

51:04.048 --> 51:06.406
I never know anyone

51:06.526 --> 51:08.394
who fucked a dead person before.

51:10.742 --> 51:13.428
I know a guy who fucked a goat once.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.586
"Pascal the goat fucker" we'd call him.

51:21.120 --> 51:23.760
This weed is really strong.

51:27.373 --> 51:29.772
It's just tobacco, it's not weed.

51:45.065 --> 51:46.404
Yeah?

51:47.406 --> 51:49.320
I know where you live.

51:52.121 --> 51:54.547
I know where your family is.

51:57.050 --> 51:59.280
I know where your wife works.

52:01.361 --> 52:04.106
I know where your kids go to school.

52:08.283 --> 52:10.438
I am gonna hurt them.

52:12.680 --> 52:15.289
I am gonna make them bleed.

52:18.623 --> 52:20.459
Nelson won't go for that.

52:21.351 --> 52:23.558
You think he'll chose you over me?

52:25.623 --> 52:26.751
No.

52:29.120 --> 52:30.473
After that,

52:32.440 --> 52:34.520
I am coming for you.

52:36.960 --> 52:40.495
You fucking grass cunt.

52:49.040 --> 52:51.442
Fuck! Martin! Martin!

52:51.964 --> 52:53.200
You're all right?

52:53.471 --> 52:54.680
Julie?

52:54.895 --> 52:57.724
Open your eyes. Open
your eyes. There you go.

52:58.221 --> 52:59.840
You're all right.
