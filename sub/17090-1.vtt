<i>I, Lemuel Gulliver</i>

01:45.680 --> 01:48.900
<i>give thee a faithful history</i>

01:49.270 --> 01:51.560
<i>of my most interesting adventure</i>

01:51.730 --> 01:53.980
<i>in the South Sea.</i>

01:54.150 --> 01:55.860
<i>On the 5th day of November, 1699,</i>

01:56.030 --> 01:57.610
<i>having reached latitude 30 degrees,</i>

01:57.860 --> 01:59.660
<i>two minutes south,</i>

01:59.860 --> 02:04.740
<i>a storm of great fury suddenly...</i>

03:40.800 --> 03:44.390
All's well!

03:46.850 --> 03:51.230
All's well!

03:55.650 --> 04:00.150
# All's well! What's a rainy day? #

04:00.240 --> 04:01.490
# Never mind that cloud. #

04:01.530 --> 04:04.990
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #

04:05.240 --> 04:09.580
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #

04:09.700 --> 04:12.460
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #

04:12.500 --> 04:14.830
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #

04:14.960 --> 04:20.260
# Everyone, come on have fun. All's well! #

04:21.010 --> 04:23.090
Why do they make me sing that song?

04:23.220 --> 04:25.640
The poet who wrote it was certainly wrong.

04:25.840 --> 04:28.350
It's bright ahead. The light's ahead.

04:28.390 --> 04:31.770
I'd rather go home and go right to bed.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.860
All's well!

04:41.650 --> 04:44.200
My feet are wet and my bunions ache,

04:44.280 --> 04:46.910
and yet I've to keep wide awake,

04:47.120 --> 04:51.410
all night!

04:56.420 --> 05:01.170
I wake folks up to tell them
things are all right!

05:01.250 --> 05:05.930
And, # All's well! What's a rainy day? #

05:05.970 --> 05:07.470
# Never mind that cloud. #

05:07.470 --> 05:10.930
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #

05:11.060 --> 05:15.480
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #

05:15.480 --> 05:18.150
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #

05:18.190 --> 05:20.570
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #

05:20.690 --> 05:24.400
# Everyone, come on have fun. All...

05:45.720 --> 05:53.680
A, A, All's well! Wha, wha, what's a rainy day?

07:06.170 --> 07:09.130
The king has visitors.

07:09.170 --> 07:11.630
Do you know they're signing a wedding contract?

07:11.630 --> 07:13.850
There's a giant on the beach!

07:13.850 --> 07:15.510
<i>There, there's a giant out there!</i>

07:29.280 --> 07:31.990
Your majesty.

07:31.990 --> 07:35.280
Thank you, your majesty.

07:36.950 --> 07:38.660
Marriage Contract

07:38.830 --> 07:42.250
King Little of Lilliput

07:42.330 --> 07:45.880
Does this 5th day of November 1699
give the hand of his daughter

07:45.880 --> 07:49.380
Princess Glory

07:49.420 --> 07:51.050
to Prince David

07:51.090 --> 07:52.840
son of Bombo

07:52.930 --> 07:55.600
King of Blefuscu!

07:55.640 --> 07:58.060
Quite in order, fine.

07:58.260 --> 08:02.230
King Bombo!

08:29.960 --> 08:33.429
Well we did it, you little rascal, you.
We did it.

08:33.549 --> 08:35.760
Yes we, we certainly did, didn't we?

08:35.760 --> 08:41.730
Just a couple of old dag cupids, I think! [laughs}

08:45.310 --> 08:49.610
Your majesty, the wedding things are here.

08:50.190 --> 08:53.030
There's a giant on the beach!
Let me go!

09:09.040 --> 09:13.050
Let me go! Let me go!
There's a giant on the beach! Let me go!

09:22.770 --> 09:26.640
Exquisite taste, exquisite!

09:26.730 --> 09:36.240
Roses, Freesia, Rhododendrons,
Ranunculus, Snap Dragons, and Daisies.

09:36.950 --> 09:39.160
Ahh!

09:43.240 --> 09:45.790
They're pretty Posies, aren't they?

09:45.870 --> 09:50.920
Beautiful blooms, beautiful!

10:00.350 --> 10:03.310
Oh!

10:05.520 --> 10:06.390
May I?

10:06.430 --> 10:11.650
Oh, please do!

10:18.150 --> 10:22.370
Magnificent!

10:35.920 --> 10:41.800
Oh! A masterpiece!

10:51.940 --> 10:55.940
Vanilla. Wow!

10:57.610 --> 11:14.920
# Faithful. Remember, that whatever I do,
I'm always faithful, my love. #

11:16.170 --> 11:25.760
# Faithful, with all my soul and thankful for you, #

11:25.890 --> 11:34.730
# who came from heaven above. #

11:34.900 --> 11:46.830
# We'll dance tonight together,
on a world with me we'll find. #

11:46.870 --> 11:49.830
My only little daughter. I dread losing her.

11:49.910 --> 11:55.750
Huh, Buck up there old boy, you're not
losing a daughter. Youâ€™re gaining a son.

11:57.420 --> 12:00.970
My son!

12:01.090 --> 12:22.490
# So I'll be faithful and faithful as I promise to be,
and you'll be for all mine. #

12:24.320 --> 12:27.660
Hmm. Lovely melody.

12:27.740 --> 12:29.830
Yes, we like it.

12:29.870 --> 12:33.160
That is Faithful. The song of Lilliput.

12:33.160 --> 12:36.250
It will be played at the wedding tomorrow.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.630
Of course. Of course.

12:38.040 --> 12:43.550
What's that, Faithful? Oh, no, no! Forever!

12:43.680 --> 12:46.680
The song of Blefuscu must be
played at the wedding.

12:46.680 --> 12:51.180
But Bombo, Faithful is always
played at our weddings.

12:51.270 --> 12:56.100
It, it's tradition, sir. And it's very pretty.

12:56.190 --> 12:59.860
Yes, yes, I know. Pleasant little ditty,

12:59.860 --> 13:03.280
oh but hardly appropriate for this great occasion.

13:03.320 --> 13:08.070
But Forever! There's a song for you! Ha, ha!

13:08.910 --> 13:10.580
Faithful will be played.

13:10.580 --> 13:15.420
Bah! Fodder. Absolute fodder. It must be Forever!

13:16.290 --> 13:19.250
Faithful.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.710
Forever!

13:20.710 --> 13:23.010
Faithful.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.630
Forever!

13:27.720 --> 13:30.140
Faithful.

13:33.480 --> 13:38.610
It will be Forever, or there will be no wedding!

13:38.650 --> 13:42.030
No wedding? But the cake
and the pretty flowers and..

13:42.110 --> 13:47.860
oh Bombo, you'll love Faithful.

13:54.080 --> 13:57.370
Ahh!

14:00.380 --> 14:05.420
It's war!

14:25.110 --> 14:27.900
There's a giant on the beach!

14:31.740 --> 14:36.620
It's war!

14:48.550 --> 14:52.680
War. Woe is me. Woe is me.

14:52.760 --> 14:56.180
I found a mountain, your majesty. I found it!
It was man, a man mountain!

14:56.310 --> 14:57.850
War isn't nice.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.390
It was, was this big!

14:59.440 --> 15:00.980
No, no. It was this big!

15:01.020 --> 15:03.150
People get hurt in wars.

15:03.230 --> 15:07.240
He's as big, as big as, as,.. big as, as, as..

15:07.360 --> 15:09.780
Wait your majesty!

15:09.780 --> 15:13.240
Bombo can't frighten me. No sir.

15:14.660 --> 15:17.000
Don't stand there like a nincompoop!

15:17.040 --> 15:20.250
I'm trying to tell you that there's a giant!

15:20.370 --> 15:24.710
When I get my dandruff up, then look out.

15:28.210 --> 15:35.850
But Glory, poor little Glory.

15:52.280 --> 15:56.280
Don't look now gentleman, but it's war.

15:56.370 --> 15:59.200
War? Whoopee!

16:01.120 --> 16:05.750
# Forever, forever, #

16:05.790 --> 16:10.840
# There won't be anyone but you. #

16:10.880 --> 16:20.060
# Remember I'm true, my sweet. #

16:20.060 --> 16:24.350
# Forever, forever, #

16:24.350 --> 16:29.320
# You'll share in everything I do, #

16:29.320 --> 16:37.580
# And keep smiling through, my sweet. #

16:37.580 --> 16:46.790
# I'll have just you here in my heart, #

16:46.790 --> 16:54.930
# And I'll trust you though we're apart. #

16:54.970 --> 17:03.480
# So, forever, forever, #

17:03.600 --> 17:08.859
# My guiding angel you will be. #

17:08.859 --> 17:29.540
# So always have faith in me. #

17:43.640 --> 17:45.230
Shh!

17:45.980 --> 17:47.350
Shh!

17:47.600 --> 17:49.110
Shh!

17:57.570 --> 18:01.580
War. Ha. Ha. Rolls off my back like a duck.

18:01.620 --> 18:04.200
But, but I'm, but I'm trying to tell ya!

18:04.250 --> 18:05.660
I'm telling ya there's, there's a...

18:05.660 --> 18:07.790
What's on your mind?

18:09.000 --> 18:09.750

18:09.790 --> 18:10.670
Speak up, man.

18:10.710 --> 18:14.710
There's a giant on the beach!
There's a giant on the beach!

18:14.840 --> 18:17.090
For heaven's sake, Gabby.
Button your mouth.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.970
Can't you see I have a war on my hands?

18:19.010 --> 18:20.970
Be off with you. Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

18:21.050 --> 18:22.640
A war?

18:22.680 --> 18:25.770
Do you suppose he could be a, a spy?

18:28.440 --> 18:29.690
Who's a spy? Who's a spy?

18:29.690 --> 18:32.770
THE GIANT ON THE BEACH!

18:32.940 --> 18:35.490
A giant? Giant? Why don't you tell me things?

18:35.610 --> 18:37.950
Do something. Don't stand there.
Go. Sic the dogs on him.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.570
Fetch him to me at once!

18:42.120 --> 18:42.910

A giant on the beach!

19:20.450 --> 19:21.360
Giant!

19:21.360 --> 19:22.280
On the beach!

19:22.320 --> 19:26.750
I said, "There's a giant on the beach!"

19:33.080 --> 19:35.340
Bring cables and tools.
Bring horses and mules.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.300
Bring snippers and clippers,
ladders and spools.

19:37.380 --> 19:39.590

Shh! Quiet. We're almost there.

21:23.570 --> 21:25.110

Well ah, ah, I can't understand it.
It was right here.

21:46.550 --> 21:49.510
Honest.

21:49.600 --> 21:53.980
Giant, huh! Dragging us out
into the dead of the night.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.190
Yeah, chasing wild geese.

21:56.230 --> 21:59.110
Gabby must have been seeing things.

21:59.110 --> 22:03.780
Maybe it just got up and flew away.

22:04.110 --> 22:08.200
Yeah, and breathing fire.

22:10.330 --> 22:13.540
Look out Gabby.
Your giant's gonna bite ya!

22:15.000 --> 22:23.250
Hey, hey fellas, maybe it was me he saw.
Look. I'm a giant! I'm a giant!

22:40.810 --> 22:42.570
Psst!

22:44.690 --> 22:46.820
Psst! Psst! Psst!

23:50.760 --> 23:52.090
And well, there he is.

23:52.140 --> 23:52.890
Huh?

23:53.260 --> 23:56.560
HE SAID, "THAT'S THE GIANT ON THE BEACH!"

23:56.600 --> 23:58.310
Shh!

23:58.600 --> 24:00.690
Shh!

24:00.850 --> 24:02.270
Shh!

24:02.310 --> 24:03.690
There isn't a moment to waste.

24:03.730 --> 24:05.860
Every last man must do all that he can.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.570
Work with the greatest of haste.

24:07.570 --> 24:11.530
So bind up its hands, its arms,
its chest, its neck, its feet!

24:11.860 --> 24:13.110
And I'll do the rest.

24:13.240 --> 24:15.700
Let's go!

24:39.810 --> 24:41.060
Quiet.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.810

26:51.520 --> 26:55.320
Put him there! No! No! Here!
Don't be afraid man!

26:56.610 --> 27:00.530
Aw! Aw! He got me! He got me!

Hey!

27:11.750 --> 27:17.260
Well, what are you rubes waiting for?
Tie him up!

Ready there below? Let's go!

31:16.710 --> 31:18.710
Giddy up, Susie! Giddy up!

31:54.080 --> 31:58.460
Lower wave in!

32:17.720 --> 32:22.350
Careful! Careful!

32:45.460 --> 32:50.130
All set below!

32:50.420 --> 32:55.180
Okay, let's go!

32:55.220 --> 32:59.020

Pull in the ropes there!

33:38.350 --> 33:41.890
Not so fast! Not so fast!
Hurry up, there! Slow down!

33:41.980 --> 33:43.440
Get the wheels past!

33:43.520 --> 33:50.570
Phew! I don't know what they would do
around here without ME!

33:54.200 --> 33:56.360
Ohhhh!

33:58.870 --> 34:01.790
Heave! Heave!

35:13.650 --> 35:20.570
Faithful was always played
at our weddings... Faithful.

35:25.830 --> 35:28.710
Faithful.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.590
Your, your, your majesty.

35:33.380 --> 35:34.960
Huh?

35:35.010 --> 35:36.970
I've got the giant!

35:37.510 --> 35:43.560
The giant. Oh, yes, yes, the giant.
Well bring him in. Bring him in.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.890
Okay. Okay.

35:47.100 --> 35:50.770
Your majesty, I don't think he'd fit in here.

35:50.770 --> 35:55.190
Oh you don't, huh?
So it's not good enough for him, hmm?

35:55.280 --> 35:59.030
Well where is he?

35:59.070 --> 36:01.490
Out there, your majesty.

36:07.370 --> 36:10.420
Now, then.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.210
Humph! Not good enough for him!

36:34.980 --> 36:38.110
Well, where is he?

36:39.650 --> 36:43.490
From here. On!

36:50.160 --> 36:56.290
Call out the guards, the army, the navy,
women and children first, I'll see you later.

37:29.490 --> 37:34.170
Search him, men. He may be armed.

38:59.330 --> 39:02.380
Ohhhh!

39:04.260 --> 39:07.840
Ugh! Why do I get out held?
Your majesty! Let me in!

39:07.840 --> 39:12.760
Look your majesty! Let me in!
Let me in! Let me in!

39:17.230 --> 39:20.860
Let me in! Let me in!
Help! I don't like this!

39:20.860 --> 39:22.400
Ohhhh!

39:26.780 --> 39:31.740
Let me go! Help! Help!
Let me go! I don't wanna die!

39:31.830 --> 39:35.080
Well, well. what have we got here?

39:35.120 --> 39:38.040
Help! Help!
Don't eat me! Don't eat me!

39:38.080 --> 39:42.210
Help! I won't taste good.
I'll give you indigestion.

39:42.250 --> 39:45.300
A man. A tiny man.

39:45.340 --> 39:48.470
You can't do this to me.
I've got a wife and kids.

39:48.510 --> 39:50.090
Millions of kids.

39:50.140 --> 39:53.510
Hold on there, mate.
Nobody's going to hurt you.

39:53.600 --> 39:58.520
Help! Put me down! Help! Help!

39:59.640 --> 40:01.440
Drop that! Drop that!

40:02.270 --> 40:05.780
Well, another one. Who are you?

40:06.070 --> 40:09.990
Who me? What? I'm king around here.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.530
Guards! Guards! To the turrets!

40:12.570 --> 40:17.790
Archers! Surround the giant!
Surround the giant! Guards!

40:24.960 --> 40:30.930
Well.

40:38.390 --> 40:42.020
Huh! You'll pay for this.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.900
Ready!

40:43.900 --> 40:46.480
Aim, fire. Aim, fire.

40:49.440 --> 40:50.740
Aim!

40:50.780 --> 40:52.320
Fire, fire, fire.

41:07.250 --> 41:10.840
How do you like that?

41:10.970 --> 41:17.140
Want some more?
All right, let her go!

41:19.850 --> 41:21.060
It's Bom

41:21.390 --> 41:22.940
Bo!

41:22.980 --> 41:27.020
Force the gates! Man the battlements!
Defend the city!

41:27.070 --> 41:30.440
We're attacked! We're attacked!

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Stop! Stop you swine!

41:44.120 --> 41:48.380
Get back to your posts!
Get back there and fight!

41:48.840 --> 41:51.460
We of Blefuscu are not!

41:53.550 --> 41:58.850
... afraid of anything.

42:04.600 --> 42:10.280
Well, where's everyone gone?

42:10.320 --> 42:13.280
This is no way to treat a harmless visitor.

42:24.870 --> 42:32.380
Look Gabby, we've won! Gabby! Gabby?

42:33.630 --> 42:39.850
See Gabby? They've gone.
Yes, sir. Scared stiff.

42:56.200 --> 42:59.160
Hello there.

43:03.200 --> 43:08.000
Come now, don't let my size frighten you.

43:11.130 --> 43:15.130
You, your majesty, surely
you're not afraid of me?

43:15.170 --> 43:17.180
Nuh uh.

43:17.220 --> 43:21.220
Well, good. Then let me present myself.

43:21.220 --> 43:27.560
My name is Gulliver, your majesty.
Lemuel Gulliver, a shipwrecked sailor.

43:27.600 --> 43:29.810
At your service.

43:29.850 --> 43:34.480
Well, welcome to Lilliput,
Mr., Mr. Gulliver.

43:34.530 --> 43:38.150
Uh Mr. Gulliver, can you fight?

43:38.200 --> 43:42.660
Well your majesty,
I can lick anybody my size.

43:42.740 --> 43:45.830
Ah, splendid, splendid!

43:45.870 --> 43:50.210
I don't think Bombo will give us any
further trouble while you're around here.

43:50.250 --> 43:52.090
No sir!

43:52.130 --> 43:55.590
He's on our side, Gabby.

43:55.880 --> 43:57.880
He's on our side!

43:57.920 --> 43:59.380

that giant is removed

48:21.980 --> 48:25.730
can our forces taste the sweet fruits of victory!

48:25.860 --> 48:31.740
Now then, it is up to you to carry
this message to my spies in Lilliput.

48:37.750 --> 48:41.540
Be off and may luck be with you!

48:44.840 --> 48:47.510
Too-de-loo!

excitement for one day.

56:57.290 --> 56:59.040
I owned a boat. A beauty, too.

57:08.720 --> 57:10.800
Lost her though in a glorious gale,

57:10.840 --> 57:12.890
but I came home on
the back of a whale.

57:12.930 --> 57:15.930
But tell me though how
you caught the whale.

57:16.350 --> 57:19.930
Simply grabbed a hold of his tail.

My, my.

57:22.980 --> 57:24.860
I, I,

57:24.900 --> 57:27.150
I climbed a mountain peak so high.

57:27.190 --> 57:29.940
I bumped my head against the sky.

57:31.240 --> 57:33.700
And there I was, where was I?

57:33.740 --> 57:35.700

But now my life is very dull.

57:46.340 --> 57:49.090

57:49.130 --> 57:52.720
Now that's the job that I'd enjoy.

57:53.470 --> 57:56.140
I must be going. Ahoy! Ahoy!

57:58.060 --> 58:02.020
My, my, my.

58:18.280 --> 58:21.540
You put that ball in there.

58:21.580 --> 58:25.040
And then it goes down and around.

58:25.130 --> 58:26.500
Pull that thing.

58:26.540 --> 58:31.300
And it comes out here.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:10.180
And at a time of war, too.
That makes it worse!

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.400
Carry on the search men!

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:19.150
Mind you, your father will hear of this.

01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:54.640
King Bombo,
Say the word and the giant is a dead duck.

01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:57.110
..is a dead duck.

01:02:59.230 --> 01:03:02.780
P.S. What do we do with the body?

01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:11.080
Two hearts and a wedding
broken by a melody?

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.250
Incredible!

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:20.460
Wait a minute.

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:24.050
I have an idea that might turn
this malice to a melody!

01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:28.890
Sing Faithful and Forever
together, as one song.

01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:46.030
The giant will be a dead duck.

01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:49.780
Ha! Now we are getting at somewhere!

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:56.500
Dear Spies, Destroy. Crush.
Obliterate! Annihilate!

01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:59.130
Kill him!

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:01.290
I will attack at dawn!

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:05.720
Affectionately yours, Bombo.

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:25.740
Whatcha got there?

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:35.500
Attack at dawn. Attack..
Bombo's attack.., Bom..., Bom...

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.210
Guards! Guards! Guards!

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:40.670
Bombo's attacking! Bombo's attacking!

01:04:40.830 --> 01:04:42.380
Bombo's attacking at dawn!

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:45.010
Bombo's attacking! It's war!

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.880
Bombo's attacking! It's war! It's war!

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.760
It's the end of the ending!

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.010
To the beach! To the beach!

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:54.600
Bomb.. attacking!

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.470
What?

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.980
Bombo attacking!

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.980
It's war! It's war!

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:01.520
To the beach! To the beach!

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.940
The enemy attacks!

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.490
To defend Lilliput.

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:17.950
To defend Lilliput!

01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:20.170
Yes, forward march.

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.760
Gulliver! Gulliver! Where are you?

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.260
Bombo's attacking.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.090
Where are you Gulliver?
We'll be wiped out!

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.300
Gulliver where are you?

01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:36.810
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.900
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:45.070
It's war! Gulliver! It's war!

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:51.780
Gulliver! Where are you?

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.580
Gulliver! Gulliver! It's war!

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:59.750
Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
Bombo's attacking! It's war!

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:01.080
Put me down.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:06.670
Hah! Well, where you been you
lazy, long legged, overgrown lummox?

01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:09.920
Now, get down there to that beach
and wipe out that Bombo

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.300
and that bunch of Blefuscuians.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:12.930
And tear em to pieces

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:15.220
and don't leave a man alive
to tell the tale.

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:17.060
Forward march! Get going!

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:20.020
Aye, aye, sir!
My, oh my.

01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:23.810
Hey! Wait for me.

01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:28.020
Gulliver, wait for me!

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:30.490
Wait for me, Gulliver!

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:39.550
No note.

01:07:47.650 --> 01:07:48.690
Where is it?

01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:50.070
What did you done with it?

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.900
Where did you lose it?

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.400
Who's got it now?

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:56.910
Gulliver! Gulliver! Wait for me!

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:03.240
Gulliver! Gulliver!

01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:19.680
Let me go! Let me go!

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:32.270
Let's go!

01:08:57.010 --> 01:09:02.140
Hold on there!
We can settle this peacefully.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.430
Listen!

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.600
Hold you fire!

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.770
Hear what I have to say.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:35.250
Bombo, order your men
to lay down their arms.

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.840
Must I make you listen?

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:37.610
David, look! Gulliver's thunder machine.

01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.670
Wait here, Glory.

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.000
David!

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.550
Fire!

01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:10.970
Fire!

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:35.080
Pull! Come on! Pull! Pull!

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:13.500
David!

01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:22.670
Poor, poor, foolish little people.

01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:24.670
Look what you've done.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.510
Now go ahead! Break your nutshell heads
over your songs!

01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:32.220
But did you have to break Glory's heart,
King Little,

01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:34.850
because you are thoughtless and selfish?

01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:41.310
And you Bombo, o mighty warrior,
what have you won?

01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:44.860
You were too stubborn to think,

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:49.910
too busy quarrelling to lend ear to the
harmony that might have been yours.

01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:57.210
But now in your sorrow and despair,

01:12:57.250 --> 01:13:01.460
perhaps you will listen to your songs
as they might be sung.

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:20.020
# Faithful forever whatever I do #

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:24.440
# Remember I'm true, #

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:28.860
# remember that #

01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:38.830
# Faithful forever and thankful for you #

01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:43.420
# I'll keep smiling through, #

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:47.340
# remember that #

01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:55.930
# We may be apart now and then #

01:13:56.010 --> 01:14:01.230
# But I'll hold you in my heart #

01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:08.610
# Till you're in my arms again #

01:14:08.690 --> 01:14:19.080
# Faithful forever I promise to be #

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:35.720
# So always have faith in me #

01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:43.440
In behalf of the peoples of
Blefuscu and Lilliput,

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:51.780
With eternal gratitude and love in our hearts,
we christen thee, Gulliver!

01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:00.620
# Come back again, come back #

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:07.000
# Wherever you may be #

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:14.840
# Come back again you sailor man, sailor man #

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:23.390
# Back again from the sea #

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:43.200
# Come back again you sailor man, sailor man #

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:54.130
# Back again from the sea #

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:14.530
