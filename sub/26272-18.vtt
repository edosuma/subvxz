00:28.638 --> 00:32.585
Get him, get him... oh...

00:32.609 --> 00:35.014
He's changing it up, mixing levels.

00:35.038 --> 00:36.520
You're drunk.

00:37.447 --> 00:39.785
You swore if I let the
girls sleep here tonight,

00:39.799 --> 00:41.843
- you wouldn't drink.
- And I didn't.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.468
Not till I tucked them in.

00:45.004 --> 00:46.613
For God's sake, woman.

00:47.906 --> 00:51.042
Who died and made you sheriff of Boring?

00:52.578 --> 00:54.723
Look at you, you can barely stand.

00:54.747 --> 00:56.491
What if there was an emergency?

00:56.515 --> 00:59.118
What if you had to take one
of the girls to the hospital?

00:59.142 --> 01:00.576
The girls are fine.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.131
And you lost the right to
lecture me when you walked out.

01:03.155 --> 01:04.522
So why don't you give me those keys?

01:04.547 --> 01:06.181
Not with my girls here.

01:07.059 --> 01:08.526
Oh, really?

01:09.011 --> 01:10.505
This is my ranch,

01:10.529 --> 01:14.733
those are my keys
and I want you off my property.

01:19.338 --> 01:21.416
I'm going

01:21.440 --> 01:23.009
and I am taking those girls with me!

01:23.033 --> 01:24.802
And as soon as I can find a lawyer,

01:24.826 --> 01:27.128
I am gonna demand full custody.

01:28.314 --> 01:29.981
The hell you are.

01:47.867 --> 01:52.137
<i>Well, the girls and I, we
did our regular bedtime routine.</i>

01:53.239 --> 01:56.808
Gave them a bath, read to them.

01:57.843 --> 01:59.944
One book turned into three.

02:00.479 --> 02:02.689
And then we said our prayers together.

02:03.082 --> 02:06.068
And after I'd finally gotten them down...

02:07.640 --> 02:11.910
I turned on the TV
and I had a few drinks.

02:12.271 --> 02:13.884
And then what happened?

02:16.453 --> 02:17.796
Mr. Reed?

02:20.966 --> 02:23.210
I heard a squeak,

02:24.270 --> 02:25.629
on the stairs.

02:27.059 --> 02:31.329
As if someone was making their
way up towards the bedrooms.

02:31.677 --> 02:33.136
To the bedrooms?

02:33.712 --> 02:35.023
Where your daughters were sleeping.

02:35.047 --> 02:36.314
Yeah.

02:36.932 --> 02:39.919
And-and like I said,
I-I'd had a few drinks,

02:39.943 --> 02:42.345
the-the whole house was dark.

02:43.002 --> 02:44.940
I grabbed my gun.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.570
I mea... I really couldn't see,

02:49.962 --> 02:53.865
and I just wanted to protect my girls.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.678
Could you see that it was a woman?

02:56.702 --> 02:59.663
Not in the dark, and not from the back.

03:00.497 --> 03:04.576
She was wearing a-a coat
and a baseball cap.

03:08.180 --> 03:09.715
But when she fell down the stairs,

03:09.739 --> 03:12.050
and when I finally saw her, I...

03:16.305 --> 03:18.089
No more questions, Your Honor.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.966
How does the jury find?

03:21.227 --> 03:23.071
On the charge of murder,

03:23.095 --> 03:26.023
we the jury find the defendant Derek Reed

03:26.589 --> 03:28.024
not guilty.

03:29.339 --> 03:32.147
Oh, my God. Yes.

03:32.171 --> 03:34.316
- Thank you, Ms. Lindsay.
- Mm-hmm.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.541
Thank you for saving my life.

03:44.650 --> 03:47.627
Victor, Sandy.

03:47.987 --> 03:50.990
I can't thank you enough
for taking care of Lila and Mae

03:51.014 --> 03:53.091
for me during this horrible ordeal.

03:54.660 --> 03:57.396
But now it's time for my girls
to come back home.

03:57.420 --> 03:58.847
No.

03:59.965 --> 04:01.558
Hell no.

04:03.310 --> 04:06.070
I don't give a damn what that jury said.

04:06.688 --> 04:08.648
You murdered our daughter.

04:09.375 --> 04:11.477
And there's no way on God's Earth

04:11.501 --> 04:14.336
I'm gonna let you anywhere
near our grandchildren.

04:20.209 --> 04:21.452
Evening.

04:22.087 --> 04:24.189
I'd just like to grab a seat at the bar.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.424
Bar's full, sir.

04:27.526 --> 04:30.429
Well, then, could I get a table?

04:30.453 --> 04:31.773
For one, sir?

04:31.797 --> 04:33.141
It's just me.

04:33.165 --> 04:36.311
It's Friday night, sir.
We're fully committed.

04:36.335 --> 04:38.771
I know you have that room
back there where you keep

04:38.795 --> 04:41.899
extra ties and jackets
for people who show up without.

04:41.923 --> 04:44.326
Do you think maybe you've got
someone back there

04:44.350 --> 04:45.852
that would sit with me?

04:45.876 --> 04:47.145
Ha, ha.

04:49.715 --> 04:51.483
You don't want to go take a look?

04:51.507 --> 04:53.902
Who knows, you might stumble
across your sense of humor.

04:57.647 --> 05:00.082
♪ You say you feeling flexible

05:05.192 --> 05:07.226
Your bag have jokes printed on them?

05:07.466 --> 05:10.536
"Why don't Americans eat snails?

05:10.560 --> 05:13.114
Because they like fast food."

05:13.138 --> 05:15.116
Huh?

05:15.140 --> 05:17.092
Huh? But wait, there's more.

05:18.210 --> 05:20.412
"How did the burger propose to the fry?

05:20.436 --> 05:22.838
With an onion ring."

05:22.862 --> 05:24.349
Big finish:

05:25.183 --> 05:27.185
"Why do hamburgers go to the gym?

05:27.810 --> 05:29.877
To get better buns."

05:32.124 --> 05:33.459
Hmm.

05:33.483 --> 05:35.418
And people say there is no God.

05:37.563 --> 05:39.965
Hello, No Caller I.D.
What can I do for you?

05:39.989 --> 05:41.825
You doing anything this weekend?

05:42.735 --> 05:43.878
Diana.

05:45.237 --> 05:47.082
Uh, damn, we're going into a tunnel.

05:47.106 --> 05:48.374
I'm gonna lose you.

05:48.398 --> 05:50.852
Can I call you back in ten minutes?

05:52.044 --> 05:53.188
Diana.

05:53.212 --> 05:55.088
I asked you a question.

05:55.648 --> 05:56.982
Listen, I have been trying

05:57.006 --> 05:59.274
to get ahold of you for two months.

05:59.759 --> 06:02.187
And, look,
I know I invited you to New York

06:02.211 --> 06:04.847
and then I uninvited you
to New York, but...

06:04.871 --> 06:07.139
You doing anything this weekend?

06:07.726 --> 06:08.831
Excuse me?

06:08.855 --> 06:11.314
There's a plane ticket for
tomorrow's noon flight to Houston

06:11.338 --> 06:12.774
waiting for you at Kennedy Airport.

06:12.798 --> 06:15.200
And I just texted you
the address of a hotel

06:15.224 --> 06:17.293
and a room number in a town
called Katy, Texas,

06:17.317 --> 06:18.818
about 30 miles outside of Houston.

06:18.842 --> 06:22.837
Rent a car at the airport, meet
me at that room at 4:00 p.m.,

06:22.861 --> 06:24.463
but leave your bags in the car.

06:24.487 --> 06:26.356
Bring a week's worth of clothes
and don't tell anyone...

06:26.380 --> 06:28.182
Wait-wait a sec,
wait-wait a sec, wait a second.

06:28.206 --> 06:30.375
So you think
that I am gonna hop on a plane

06:30.399 --> 06:32.401
just 'cause you snap your fingers

06:32.425 --> 06:34.530
and I'm feeling a little guilty?

06:34.554 --> 06:36.756
Oh, I'm certain of it.

06:44.730 --> 06:46.641
Welcome to Katy, Texas, sir.

06:46.665 --> 06:49.244
Mm. What are we doing here?

06:49.268 --> 06:52.013
Well, it's 30 miles outside
of Houston and I don't know

06:52.037 --> 06:55.273
a soul who lives here,
and I'm guessing neither do you.

06:56.642 --> 06:58.286
And I wouldn't want people to know

06:58.310 --> 07:00.211
we're gonna be in this room together.

07:01.313 --> 07:02.457
Wow.

07:02.481 --> 07:04.192
I guess this means you forgive me now.

07:04.216 --> 07:06.785
No. This means I don't forgive you.

07:07.853 --> 07:09.339
Not yet.

07:09.363 --> 07:12.631
So I've been representing
this very wealthy man,

07:12.655 --> 07:14.082
Derek Reed.

07:14.106 --> 07:16.041
He was accused of murdering his wife.

07:16.065 --> 07:18.206
Okay, and you need help.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.475
No, trial's over. I won.

07:20.499 --> 07:22.364
- I'm impressed.
- Mm.

07:22.388 --> 07:25.146
Now his wife's parents are suing

07:25.170 --> 07:27.349
for the custody
of their two little girls.

07:27.349 --> 07:29.661
Blake Powers, my firm's senior
family law attorney,

07:29.685 --> 07:31.329
is handling that case.

07:31.353 --> 07:33.665
- He any good?
- Well,

07:33.689 --> 07:36.668
if you listen to him,
he's the best in Texas.

07:37.023 --> 07:38.403
I'm waiting for a punch line.

07:38.427 --> 07:39.737
Well, here it comes.

07:39.761 --> 07:42.740
Did you know that Texas
is the only state of the Union

07:42.764 --> 07:45.410
where you have the right
to request a jury trial

07:45.434 --> 07:47.145
in a child custody case?

07:47.169 --> 07:48.746
I did not know that.

07:48.770 --> 07:50.348
So is that why I'm here?

07:50.372 --> 07:52.350
You want me to help
this colleague of yours?

07:52.374 --> 07:55.917
No. I want you to help the other side.

07:57.713 --> 08:00.130
I want you to help these
children's grandparents.

08:01.172 --> 08:02.527
Aha.

08:03.341 --> 08:05.230
You think your guy did it, don't you?

08:05.254 --> 08:06.731
Murdered his wife.

08:06.755 --> 08:08.366
You know I can't answer that question.

08:08.390 --> 08:10.702
In fact, I will go to my grave
denying we ever had

08:10.726 --> 08:12.437
- this conversation.
- What conversation?

08:12.461 --> 08:14.339
I'm serious, Jason.

08:14.644 --> 08:16.007
Me reaching out to you like this,

08:16.031 --> 08:18.209
it could get me fired, even disbarred.

08:19.568 --> 08:20.835
Excuse me a moment.

08:22.938 --> 08:25.083
Okay. That's my car.

08:25.107 --> 08:28.219
So, are you gonna do this for me?

08:28.243 --> 08:29.844
What, we can't have dinner?

08:30.946 --> 08:32.657
I haven't forgiven you yet.

08:32.681 --> 08:34.046
When will that be?

08:34.070 --> 08:36.928
Well, when you win.

08:36.952 --> 08:38.566
What's this?

08:38.590 --> 08:40.198
The keycards for this room.

08:40.222 --> 08:41.732
You're only to come here when I call you.

08:41.756 --> 08:45.203
On that piece of paper is the
grandparents' name and address.

08:45.227 --> 08:46.638
They're expecting you at their house

08:46.662 --> 08:48.973
tomorrow morning at 11:00 a.m.

08:48.997 --> 08:52.110
I called from a public phone,
pretended I worked for you.

08:52.134 --> 08:53.544
You're scary.

08:53.568 --> 08:55.546
No, baby, I'm thorough.

08:55.570 --> 08:57.482
You stay here ten minutes,
I'm leaving now.

08:57.506 --> 08:59.517
Don't you think you're
being a little dramatic?

08:59.541 --> 09:01.019
How about we order room service?

09:01.043 --> 09:03.354
I'll hide in the bathroom
when they deliver the food.

09:03.378 --> 09:04.856
I'm very good at hiding in bathrooms.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.324
In fact, I've won awards for it.

09:06.348 --> 09:10.895
Okay. This room is a place
for you and I to talk.

09:10.919 --> 09:12.764
About the case,

09:13.328 --> 09:14.355
period.

09:16.458 --> 09:17.832
Thank you.

09:19.417 --> 09:21.472
I don't even remember saying yes.

09:21.496 --> 09:24.506
Well, I do, and I'm very grateful.

09:28.370 --> 09:33.772
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

09:34.666 --> 09:35.798
I don't get it.

09:35.822 --> 09:39.484
You are a New York City trial scientist,

09:39.509 --> 09:41.821
and you came all the way down here

09:41.845 --> 09:43.331
to help us.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.510
And how did you even come
to hear about our case?

09:45.944 --> 09:49.290
An attorney here in Houston
was outraged by the verdict

09:49.314 --> 09:51.883
in your daughter's murder trial,
reached out to me.

09:52.492 --> 09:55.863
But that attorney insists
on remaining anonymous.

09:56.121 --> 09:57.565
And is he paying you?

09:57.589 --> 09:58.966
No.

09:59.374 --> 10:00.835
Derek Reed paying you?

10:01.709 --> 10:03.037
No.

10:03.461 --> 10:05.518
Hey, Victor, bring the doctor out front!

10:05.964 --> 10:07.888
<i>That Derek's a charmer.</i>

10:08.341 --> 10:10.236
Had us completely fooled.

10:10.260 --> 10:12.325
I realized pretty quick his ranch foreman

10:12.349 --> 10:14.514
was doing all
the heavy lifting out there.

10:15.152 --> 10:17.497
Left Derek with a lot
of free time on his hands

10:17.521 --> 10:18.976
which he spent mostly drinking.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.214
Yeah. Brought out a mean temper in him.

10:21.926 --> 10:23.737
And how long had they been separated?

10:23.761 --> 10:25.171
Barely three weeks.

10:25.195 --> 10:27.211
She'd just moved herself and the girls

10:27.212 --> 10:28.736
in here with us.

10:29.214 --> 10:31.459
Hadn't even filed for divorce yet.

10:31.483 --> 10:33.194
Any idea what possessed your daughter

10:33.218 --> 10:35.262
to go over to the ranch
at that late hour?

10:35.286 --> 10:36.630
No.

10:36.654 --> 10:38.799
The girls were
spending the night with Derek.

10:39.205 --> 10:41.791
Amanda went out
to the grocery store and then...

10:43.000 --> 10:45.279
...she just never came back.

10:45.397 --> 10:46.874
Police said he called her

10:46.898 --> 10:49.014
about 15 minutes before the killing.

10:49.038 --> 10:51.946
It's a good sign, don't you
think, that the custody judge

10:51.970 --> 10:54.115
is letting us keep Lila and Mae
through the trial?

10:54.596 --> 10:56.079
Well, maybe.

10:56.103 --> 10:58.886
But it'll be up to the jury
to make the final decision.

10:58.910 --> 11:00.354
Well, that Derek sure knows

11:00.378 --> 11:01.811
how to charm a jury.

11:03.021 --> 11:04.625
Mr. Harper,

11:04.649 --> 11:06.360
figuring out what to say to a jury

11:06.384 --> 11:07.484
is what I do.

11:08.887 --> 11:10.197
I'd like to help you.

11:10.221 --> 11:13.069
But I can't make you take my help.

11:13.093 --> 11:15.559
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
you're our man.

11:17.495 --> 11:18.996
Isn't that right, Victor?

11:22.019 --> 11:24.083
You just get me those kids.

11:26.204 --> 11:28.182
Oh...

11:28.206 --> 11:29.617
Hello?

11:29.641 --> 11:30.885
Good morning.

11:30.909 --> 11:32.386
I'm in Houston.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.385
Uh-huh.

11:34.886 --> 11:37.398
Say hello to Diana for me.

11:37.847 --> 11:40.394
This has nothing to do with
Diana, it's strictly business.

11:40.418 --> 11:42.163
Whatever you say.

11:42.187 --> 11:44.064
I need you to clear everyone's schedule

11:44.088 --> 11:45.766
for a few weeks and book a flight

11:45.790 --> 11:47.268
to Houston for you and Benny.

11:47.815 --> 11:49.236
The two of us?

11:49.260 --> 11:50.738
H-How soon?

11:50.762 --> 11:53.808
Well, right now; tomorrow's Monday.

11:54.239 --> 11:56.811
The thing is, I don't think that I can.

11:57.283 --> 11:59.160
I have this doctor thing.

11:59.604 --> 12:00.748
It was really hard to get

12:00.772 --> 12:03.484
and it's very time-sensitive and...

12:03.508 --> 12:05.019
You all right?

12:05.043 --> 12:06.709
I'm fine. It's just...

12:07.779 --> 12:10.046
it's really just something
I need to attend to.

12:11.047 --> 12:12.423
Okay.

12:13.716 --> 12:15.329
Well, talk to Taylor, see if she can

12:15.353 --> 12:17.011
make arrangements for her son.

12:17.722 --> 12:19.600
Since the parties cannot agree

12:19.625 --> 12:23.071
as to what's in the
children's best interest,

12:23.096 --> 12:26.521
let me share the guardian
ad litem's recommendations.

12:27.801 --> 12:29.946
The guardian found nothing
in her investigation

12:29.970 --> 12:31.481
to warrant overturning the preference

12:31.505 --> 12:33.283
for keeping the children
with their biological parent.

12:33.307 --> 12:36.469
Moreover, she reports...

12:36.493 --> 12:37.622
Here it is.

12:37.646 --> 12:39.689
"While Lila didn't wish to choose between

12:39.713 --> 12:41.324
"her father and her grandparents,

12:41.348 --> 12:43.226
"her younger sister Mae definitely wants

12:43.250 --> 12:44.986
"to live with her father.

12:45.010 --> 12:47.831
Therefore, "it's the guardian's
recommendation that the children

12:47.855 --> 12:50.433
be returned to their father, Mr. Reed."

12:50.457 --> 12:51.801
Forgive me, Your Honor,

12:51.825 --> 12:53.169
but if I understand you correctly,

12:53.193 --> 12:54.537
this court-appointed guardian

12:54.561 --> 12:56.139
is basing her decision
solely on the whims

12:56.163 --> 12:58.842
of a four-year-old girl who's grieving

12:58.866 --> 13:01.978
the loss of her mother and
misses the house she grew up in?

13:02.265 --> 13:04.874
Does that make sense to you?

13:04.898 --> 13:06.650
We're the grown-ups in the room.

13:06.674 --> 13:09.352
And we're the ones
who should think long and hard

13:09.376 --> 13:11.087
before handing these girls
over to the man

13:11.111 --> 13:12.489
who shot their mother.

13:12.513 --> 13:14.860
It was an accident. Everybody
knows it was an accident.

13:14.884 --> 13:16.926
Your Honor, my client has come here today

13:16.950 --> 13:18.995
with a fair and reasonable offer

13:19.019 --> 13:21.298
and has only been met with hostility

13:21.322 --> 13:25.168
- and outright provocation.
- Save it for the courtroom, Counselor.

13:25.192 --> 13:29.261
It is obvious the parties
are too far apart

13:29.285 --> 13:32.763
to resolve their differences
in mediation. Therefore,

13:32.787 --> 13:34.511
we will commence with trial.

13:34.535 --> 13:37.447
But I want to make
one thing absolutely clear.

13:37.967 --> 13:39.816
This is a custody hearing.

13:40.595 --> 13:43.987
Not a retrial of Mr. Reed's
murder charge.

13:44.011 --> 13:47.691
Mr. Reed was acquitted in a court of law.

13:47.715 --> 13:50.193
And I will not allow any evidence

13:50.217 --> 13:52.329
attempting to prove that Mr. Reed

13:52.353 --> 13:54.264
intentionally killed his wife.

13:54.288 --> 13:55.799
Is that understood?

13:56.527 --> 13:57.695
Yes, Your Honor.

14:00.345 --> 14:01.689
Well,

14:02.575 --> 14:04.058
make yourselves at home, why don't you?

14:04.082 --> 14:05.392
Everybody comfy?

14:05.416 --> 14:06.961
What's not to like?

14:06.985 --> 14:08.596
They make your bed, they bring you food.

14:08.620 --> 14:10.664
- Life is good.
- She's only saying that

14:10.688 --> 14:12.299
'cause she doesn't have to go into court.

14:12.323 --> 14:14.368
- Hmm.
- Now, I'm not gonna lie.

14:14.392 --> 14:17.104
Being able to tell the jury
that Derek murdered his wife

14:17.128 --> 14:19.106
would have made a real difference.

14:19.130 --> 14:21.475
Not sure we have much
of a hand to play anymore.

14:21.499 --> 14:25.246
Well, we just got to shuffle
the deck a little.

14:25.270 --> 14:27.681
Find some other way to show the jury

14:27.705 --> 14:29.319
that Derek is an unfit parent.

14:29.343 --> 14:30.986
Well, first thing tomorrow,
I'm gonna start looking

14:31.010 --> 14:33.420
for domestic disturbance reports,

14:33.444 --> 14:36.457
um, complaints from
neighbors, medical records.

14:36.481 --> 14:38.626
Benny's right, there's
got to be something.

14:38.650 --> 14:41.662
And I'm gonna keep boning up
on this Texas custody law.

14:41.686 --> 14:44.198
And I am going to bed.

14:44.222 --> 14:47.067
I will see you both
in the lobby, 8:00 a.m.

14:47.245 --> 14:48.992
See you then.

14:49.861 --> 14:51.413
And the more Derek drank,

14:51.415 --> 14:53.530
the more worried I got for my daughter.

14:53.918 --> 14:55.399
And for those little girls.

14:55.401 --> 14:56.833
And what makes you say that?

14:57.255 --> 14:59.603
Did you... ever witness an incident

14:59.605 --> 15:02.239
where Derek put Lila and Mae in danger?

15:02.241 --> 15:04.808
Well, about a year ago,
Derek and Amanda and the kids,

15:04.810 --> 15:06.810
they came over to our place
for a barbecue.

15:07.557 --> 15:08.808
Derek went through the better part

15:08.810 --> 15:10.358
of a bottle of whiskey that night.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.582
And when Amanda told him

15:11.584 --> 15:14.017
there was no way he was
driving the family home,

15:14.019 --> 15:15.398
he got angry.

15:16.315 --> 15:17.454
Screamed at her.

15:17.859 --> 15:19.049
Got so riled up,

15:19.051 --> 15:21.258
he slammed the porch door
and broke the window glass.

15:21.260 --> 15:23.293
Lila and Mae were terrified.

15:23.698 --> 15:25.462
And my Amanda...

15:29.400 --> 15:31.312
I should have done something then.

15:31.336 --> 15:32.913
Protected my child.

15:32.937 --> 15:34.982
Protected my child's children.

15:36.407 --> 15:38.087
Before it's too late.

15:39.744 --> 15:41.455
Talk to me. Unless these people

15:41.479 --> 15:42.990
are made of stone, you got to be

15:43.014 --> 15:44.458
staring at more green than red.

15:44.482 --> 15:47.294
The mirror jurors appear
to be very moved by Victor.

15:47.318 --> 15:49.430
Of course, it's still early.

15:49.454 --> 15:51.699
That's okay. I try my best
to savor the good times

15:51.723 --> 15:52.973
when they present themselves.

15:52.997 --> 15:55.502
Now, taking care
of two active little girls

15:55.526 --> 15:58.072
when you're in your 60s,
that can't be easy.

15:58.096 --> 15:59.740
My wife and I relish it.

16:00.109 --> 16:01.577
Lila and Mae, they,

16:01.601 --> 16:02.810
they keep us young.

16:02.834 --> 16:04.278
Of course, if you are awarded

16:04.302 --> 16:07.014
full custody, well, you'll be able

16:07.038 --> 16:09.116
to afford some help, won't you?

16:09.535 --> 16:10.985
Much bigger house.

16:11.009 --> 16:12.720
All the things that make life easier.

16:12.744 --> 16:14.955
Maybe a nanny, maybe a cook.

16:14.979 --> 16:18.659
'Cause you will have
control of the trust fund

16:18.683 --> 16:21.161
that Derek's parents set up for the girls

16:21.185 --> 16:23.597
before they died, isn't that true?

16:23.925 --> 16:26.133
If you're implying
my wife and I want those girls

16:26.157 --> 16:28.569
for any reason other
than that we love them

16:29.055 --> 16:30.971
and that we believe
that their father is unfit

16:30.995 --> 16:33.273
to care for them, you are dead wrong.

16:33.297 --> 16:34.508
Hmm.

16:34.532 --> 16:36.210
We don't care about Derek's family money.

16:36.234 --> 16:37.378
He can keep it.

16:37.402 --> 16:38.646
We have plenty enough

16:38.670 --> 16:40.280
to provide for those girls.

16:40.304 --> 16:42.149
Marissa, do they believe him?

16:42.173 --> 16:43.283
They certainly do.

16:43.307 --> 16:44.652
That...

16:44.676 --> 16:46.787
is very admirable, Mr. Harper.

16:47.281 --> 16:48.822
Clear to me...

16:48.846 --> 16:50.958
to the jury, I'm betting...

16:51.369 --> 16:55.129
you're a man of high moral character.

16:55.581 --> 16:56.997
I'd like to think so.

16:57.021 --> 16:59.299
Not a doubt in my mind.

16:59.669 --> 17:01.235
Hmm.

17:01.629 --> 17:02.703
Hey...

17:02.727 --> 17:04.006
Mr. Harper...

17:04.494 --> 17:08.231
do you happen to know
a woman named Nadine Johnson?

17:11.513 --> 17:12.246
Yes.

17:12.973 --> 17:15.957
Did you have a romantic relationship

17:15.981 --> 17:19.678
with Ms. Johnson roughly 45 years ago?

17:19.702 --> 17:21.178
Objection.

17:21.202 --> 17:23.882
- Relevance.
- I promise, Your Honor,

17:24.726 --> 17:26.593
I'm about to make the connection.

17:26.617 --> 17:28.028
Overruled.

17:28.051 --> 17:29.821
Witness will answer the question.

17:34.505 --> 17:35.788
Yes.

17:36.829 --> 17:39.040
And did you and Ms. Johnson

17:39.709 --> 17:41.999
have a child together?

17:44.922 --> 17:46.181
Yes.

17:49.041 --> 17:52.810
Did you have any role
in raising that child?

17:55.781 --> 17:57.101
No.

17:58.317 --> 18:00.462
No, I did not.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.130
Well...

18:02.565 --> 18:05.033
so will you mind telling the court

18:05.057 --> 18:08.136
why you think you
should be granted custody

18:08.160 --> 18:11.506
of your grandchildren when in the past

18:11.530 --> 18:15.286
you saw fit to abandon your own child?

18:15.601 --> 18:18.246
Did you know about this?

18:18.270 --> 18:19.457
No.

18:20.374 --> 18:21.834
Never.

18:22.274 --> 18:23.586
No.

18:28.686 --> 18:31.131
You should have told us
about the child, Mr. Harper.

18:31.552 --> 18:34.435
If you had just filled us in,
we could've gotten ahead of it.

18:34.930 --> 18:36.526
There's not much to tell.

18:38.309 --> 18:40.186
Her name was Nadine.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.230
We were both 19.

18:44.357 --> 18:46.246
It was a summer fling.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.028
Not a care in the world.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.485
Then one day, boom...

18:51.509 --> 18:54.158
out of nowhere, she's pregnant.

18:58.108 --> 19:00.243
I figured it was a sign.

19:01.732 --> 19:04.835
So I said, "Okay. Let's get married."

19:06.420 --> 19:08.547
And she said the damnedest thing to me.

19:09.924 --> 19:11.967
She said, "I really don't want to."

19:13.719 --> 19:16.109
She wanted to go back home to Indiana.

19:16.900 --> 19:19.116
She had a high school
sweetheart back there... she...

19:20.059 --> 19:23.410
wanted him to be the man
she brought up the baby with.

19:25.815 --> 19:27.648
She wouldn't even discuss it.

19:31.153 --> 19:32.896
Jimmy.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.089
Yeah. Name's Jimmy.

19:37.660 --> 19:39.954
He's a civil engineer in Colorado.

19:41.205 --> 19:42.906
Got a boy of his own.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.431
Jimmy.

19:45.833 --> 19:48.612
I've been married to you
for almost 40 years.

19:49.547 --> 19:52.239
I never once heard you say that name.

19:53.574 --> 19:56.512
Your <i>son's</i> name.

19:58.139 --> 20:00.591
Not when we decided to get married,

20:01.267 --> 20:03.394
not when we decided to have a baby.

20:05.229 --> 20:08.732
And not even when
our only child was murdered.

20:08.756 --> 20:10.100
I wanted to tell you.

20:10.124 --> 20:11.458
No, you didn't.

20:13.392 --> 20:15.227
You've been lying to me
our whole marriage.

20:16.431 --> 20:20.344
Now your lies are gonna
cost us our granddaughters!

20:20.368 --> 20:22.746
Our granddaughters!

20:23.003 --> 20:26.549
We are gonna lose Lila and Mae over this!

20:27.723 --> 20:28.685
Are you happy?

20:28.709 --> 20:30.687
- Are you proud of yourself?
- No! Stop it!

20:30.711 --> 20:32.756
Stop yelling at Grandpa! Stop!

20:32.780 --> 20:35.125
Honey, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

20:35.149 --> 20:36.826
It's okay.

20:36.850 --> 20:39.429
Grandma was just upset for a little bit.

20:39.453 --> 20:41.331
But everything's okay.

20:41.355 --> 20:43.044
Come here, baby.

20:43.068 --> 20:44.555
It's okay.

20:44.579 --> 20:46.169
Tell me you can fix this.

20:46.193 --> 20:47.845
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

20:47.869 --> 20:49.873
Tell me there's something we can do.

20:50.691 --> 20:53.209
Tell us there are no more secrets.

20:53.861 --> 20:54.945
Shh...

20:54.969 --> 20:57.013
You have my word.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.731
_

21:12.820 --> 21:14.965
Derek and Powers have been in the office

21:14.989 --> 21:16.466
celebrating all afternoon.

21:17.343 --> 21:18.835
They're gonna give him
those kids, aren't they?

21:18.859 --> 21:20.070
You know the answer to that.

21:20.094 --> 21:23.390
Yeah. He's gonna get what he wants...

21:23.764 --> 21:26.943
'cause 40 years ago a 19-year-old kid

21:26.967 --> 21:28.611
got a girl he met one summer pregnant,

21:28.635 --> 21:29.913
and I know one

21:29.937 --> 21:32.015
has nothing to do with
the other, and you know one

21:32.039 --> 21:34.651
has nothing to do with
the other, but juries...

21:34.675 --> 21:35.852
What are we gonna do?

21:35.876 --> 21:38.888
Well, I know what I'm gonna do.

21:38.912 --> 21:41.391
I am gonna plead with you

21:41.415 --> 21:43.560
to tell me everything
you can about this guy,

21:43.584 --> 21:45.762
anything that could make a difference,

21:45.786 --> 21:47.364
- 'cause short of that...
- Jason,

21:47.388 --> 21:50.467
I can't do that.
You know I can't do that.

21:50.491 --> 21:52.736
It's such a gross violation of ethics.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.047
I was this man's lawyer.

21:54.071 --> 21:56.373
Well, now I'm basically
these little girls' lawyer,

21:56.397 --> 21:59.409
and I would like to win,
for them, for you, for me.

21:59.433 --> 22:01.277
So for God's sakes, will you talk to me?

22:01.301 --> 22:02.652
- I can't!
- Then what the hell

22:02.677 --> 22:04.447
did you rent this room for?

22:04.471 --> 22:06.850
You won't talk to me.
You won't eat with me.

22:06.874 --> 22:08.351
You won't sleep with me.

22:08.375 --> 22:11.272
- You are a pig!
- You're damn right.

22:11.945 --> 22:14.858
I'm a pig who likes to win.

Okay, sweet pea,
it's time to go night-night.

22:29.897 --> 22:32.742
No, I'll sing to you
again tomorrow night.

22:32.766 --> 22:34.211
I love you.

22:37.304 --> 22:38.581
You mock, you die.

22:38.605 --> 22:42.585
No, no, no, not me. I am mock-less.

22:42.609 --> 22:44.889
Mauricio had a bad dream.

22:45.979 --> 22:48.425
Doesn't really understand
his mom being so far away.

22:48.449 --> 22:51.027
You and your ex must be pretty amicable

22:51.051 --> 22:52.896
for him to reach out to you like that.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.864
Mm, I wouldn't go straight to amicable,

22:54.888 --> 22:58.444
but we do both really love
our little boy.

23:01.728 --> 23:03.740
And I've never once worried

23:03.764 --> 23:05.618
that Mauricio's unsafe with him.

23:06.533 --> 23:08.334
Or that I might get shot in the back.

23:11.205 --> 23:12.916
The thought that that killer

23:12.940 --> 23:14.350
might get custody
of those little girls...

23:14.374 --> 23:16.045
I know.

23:16.710 --> 23:18.822
I take it you didn't find
any dirt on Derek?

23:18.846 --> 23:21.958
No, and I know Bull's got it in his head

23:21.982 --> 23:23.526
that there's something to find,

23:23.550 --> 23:25.084
but I'm coming up empty.

23:26.820 --> 23:28.865
Hey. What're you doing?

23:28.889 --> 23:30.133
Finish your food.

23:30.157 --> 23:32.686
No, no, I got to see this through.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.271
Amanda's social media feeds.

23:35.295 --> 23:37.941
I keep hoping I'll find
a picture of Amanda

23:37.965 --> 23:41.336
or one of the girls
with a bruise or a cast.

23:41.360 --> 23:44.547
Ah, what a wonderful thing to wish for.

23:44.571 --> 23:47.217
Now, Mr. Reed,

23:47.241 --> 23:49.152
did you and your wife ever fight?

23:50.245 --> 23:51.956
All couples fight,

23:52.880 --> 23:55.158
and we had our fair share.

23:55.626 --> 23:58.828
And then, when Amanda came and
told me she wanted a divorce,

23:58.852 --> 24:01.131
maybe we had more than our fair share,

24:02.689 --> 24:06.636
but we did our best not to
let it affect the children,

24:06.660 --> 24:09.067
not to let it upset Lila and Mae.

24:09.091 --> 24:13.710
Now we have heard stories
about your drinking.

24:13.734 --> 24:15.145
It's true.

24:16.136 --> 24:18.983
I let my drinking get
out of control for a while,

24:20.641 --> 24:23.086
and, uh, I know it's-it's no excuse,

24:23.110 --> 24:25.522
but I-I'd just lost both my parents,

24:25.546 --> 24:28.224
and I was trying to run a ranch,
and on top of that,

24:28.248 --> 24:30.790
my marriage was falling apart,

24:30.814 --> 24:32.170
so I drank.

24:32.194 --> 24:33.997
They're feeling sorry
for him, aren't they?

24:34.021 --> 24:35.732
I'm afraid so.

24:35.756 --> 24:37.668
I've not had a drink since...

24:39.545 --> 24:41.738
since the night of the accident.

24:44.131 --> 24:47.052
That was quite a performance
our sharpshooter dad gave.

24:47.701 --> 24:49.879
Any ideas about what
to come back at him with?

24:50.679 --> 24:52.849
Wait a minute.
Looks like we have company.

24:53.183 --> 24:55.185
Found you guys.

24:55.209 --> 24:56.753
I hope that's not all you found.

24:56.777 --> 24:58.555
Any luck with the photos?

24:58.579 --> 25:02.225
Actually, interestingly, I found
a peculiar absence of photos.

25:02.776 --> 25:04.427
You lost me at "actually."

25:04.451 --> 25:07.430
Turns out Amanda and Derek
went to Italy last year.

25:07.454 --> 25:09.732
Soon as she got there,
she started posting photos,

25:09.756 --> 25:12.502
but by day two of the trip, nothing.

25:12.526 --> 25:14.637
Wait a minute, they went on vacation?

25:14.661 --> 25:17.807
Who only posts a day's worth of
photos when they're on vacation?

25:17.831 --> 25:21.578
Nobody, certainly not
a obsessive poster like Amanda,

25:21.602 --> 25:23.947
so I worked every
Italian contact I ever had

25:23.971 --> 25:26.425
from my Homeland days, and...

25:27.140 --> 25:29.215
well, you can read for yourselves.

25:30.345 --> 25:31.454
<i>Mr. Reed,</i>

25:31.478 --> 25:32.822
it is our understanding

25:32.846 --> 25:34.057
that you and your late wife

25:34.081 --> 25:35.548
took a big trip to Italy last year.

25:37.117 --> 25:39.229
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance?

25:39.253 --> 25:42.098
Mr. Powers, you just spent
the entire morning questioning

25:42.122 --> 25:44.133
Mr. Reed about events in his marriage.

25:44.157 --> 25:46.903
Why shouldn't I allow opposing
counsel the same liberty?

25:46.927 --> 25:48.061
Overruled.

25:48.614 --> 25:50.340
Witness will answer the question.

25:51.241 --> 25:54.328
Yes. We did go to Italy.

25:54.768 --> 25:56.079
Amanda had always wanted to go,

25:56.103 --> 25:57.814
so I surprised her

25:57.838 --> 25:59.916
- with tickets for her birthday.
- Aw.

25:59.940 --> 26:01.284
That's nice.

26:01.308 --> 26:03.052
And while you were in Rome,

26:03.076 --> 26:04.954
Amanda ended up at the hospital

26:04.978 --> 26:07.323
with a broken cheekbone, is that correct?

26:07.347 --> 26:11.861
She did. We were staying
at this beautiful old hotel...

26:11.885 --> 26:15.698
very quaint... um, but the
bathtub was super slippery,

26:15.722 --> 26:17.533
and there was nothing to hold on to,

26:17.557 --> 26:19.035
nothing to give your feet traction

26:19.059 --> 26:20.903
when you were getting in or out.

26:20.927 --> 26:23.139
So sure enough, one night,

26:23.163 --> 26:25.942
Amanda fell and-and she cracked her cheek

26:25.966 --> 26:27.443
on the edge of the tub.

26:28.362 --> 26:30.813
No, I know, I know, that-that's what you

26:30.837 --> 26:33.483
told the hospital, but according
to hospital records,

26:33.507 --> 26:36.552
when Amanda had a moment alone,
she confessed that the injuries

26:36.576 --> 26:37.954
were a result of you hitting her.

26:37.978 --> 26:39.151
Objection.

26:39.175 --> 26:40.278
Your Honor,

26:40.302 --> 26:42.797
these records have not been
introduced or authenticated.

26:42.821 --> 26:44.663
Right you are. My mistake.

26:44.687 --> 26:47.730
Your Honor, I'd like
to introduce as Exhibit 27

26:47.754 --> 26:49.999
these hospital records

26:50.023 --> 26:54.070
and a notarized affidavit
from the hospital administrator.

26:54.346 --> 26:55.961
So admitted.

26:59.099 --> 27:02.054
So, exactly how hard
did you have to hit your wife

27:02.078 --> 27:04.347
to break her cheekbone, Mr. Reed?

27:04.371 --> 27:06.716
Must have been quite a wallop.

27:06.740 --> 27:08.323
Your Honor.

27:08.347 --> 27:10.353
Never mind. I withdraw the question.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.555
He's very good at this.

27:12.579 --> 27:14.057
♪ Ow!

27:26.860 --> 27:28.463
Well...

27:28.929 --> 27:31.207
don't you look like the
cat who ate the canary.

27:31.231 --> 27:32.942
Actually, I haven't eaten yet.

27:32.966 --> 27:35.078
Which is why I ordered room service.

27:35.596 --> 27:37.639
You could hide in the bathroom
when they knock.

27:38.805 --> 27:40.305
You got my text?

27:40.329 --> 27:42.051
"The worm turns."

27:42.075 --> 27:45.188
- You the worm?
- Worm. Pig. Whatever works.

27:45.564 --> 27:47.390
We had a very good day in court today.

27:47.414 --> 27:49.225
Thought you'd want to hear about it.

27:49.735 --> 27:52.028
I gathered as much.

27:52.487 --> 27:54.698
Looks like you're doing just
what I thought you would do.

27:55.489 --> 27:56.956
You're kicking his ass.

27:58.994 --> 28:01.327
I'm sorry I called you a pig.

28:05.876 --> 28:07.533
I'm sorry I said
I want to sleep with you.

28:09.671 --> 28:11.147
Okay, that's a lie.

28:11.965 --> 28:13.216
That's okay.

28:13.240 --> 28:14.884
Mine was a lie, too.

28:14.908 --> 28:17.220
Hmm. Have you eaten?

28:17.244 --> 28:18.821
Mm-mm.

28:18.845 --> 28:20.089
Prove it.

28:20.515 --> 28:22.181
Bring that mouth over here.

28:28.023 --> 28:29.599
You should get that.

28:30.025 --> 28:31.734
It could be Benny about the case.

28:31.758 --> 28:33.569
It's a text.

28:33.593 --> 28:35.471
It'll hold. Benny's a big boy.

28:35.495 --> 28:37.646
He can hold down the fort all by himself.

28:37.670 --> 28:38.775
Hmm.

28:42.955 --> 28:45.104
I don't have a Benny.

28:52.212 --> 28:54.190
Oh. Wonder what this is about.

28:54.214 --> 28:56.492
I've been summoned
to the judge's chambers

28:56.516 --> 28:58.595
at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

28:59.513 --> 29:01.531
Well, how weird is this?

29:01.555 --> 29:04.066
<i>I</i> got summoned to the judge's chambers

29:04.090 --> 29:05.811
at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.604
I just lost my appetite.

29:08.814 --> 29:10.273
Me, too.

29:13.519 --> 29:15.751
Mr. Powers, I gather
that your client believes

29:15.776 --> 29:18.148
the integrity of this trial
has been compromised?

29:18.173 --> 29:19.690
Yes, Your Honor.

29:19.690 --> 29:21.801
Mr. Reed has concerns
that one of my partners,

29:21.825 --> 29:23.169
Ms. Diana Lindsay,

29:23.193 --> 29:25.305
who represented him
in his criminal trial,

29:25.329 --> 29:28.541
divulged privileged information
to the petitioners' legal team.

29:28.565 --> 29:31.377
Your Honor, that is absolutely not true.

29:32.170 --> 29:35.114
Mr. Reed, this is a serious accusation.

29:35.138 --> 29:36.983
Do you have any evidence to back it up?

29:37.007 --> 29:40.622
I do. While we were preparing
for the last trial,

29:40.646 --> 29:43.890
I told Ms. Lindsay about what
happened to Amanda in Rome.

29:43.914 --> 29:46.059
I figured it could be misconstrued

29:46.083 --> 29:49.462
if it was brought up in court,
and I wanted her to be prepared.

29:50.105 --> 29:51.248
But the D.A.

29:51.272 --> 29:53.600
never mentioned it. Apparently
he never even heard about it.

29:53.624 --> 29:54.901
But out of nowhere,

29:54.925 --> 29:56.589
these folks from New York show up,

29:56.613 --> 29:58.438
and they know all about it.

29:58.822 --> 30:01.040
So I did some research.

30:01.064 --> 30:03.810
Turns out that Ms. Lindsay

30:03.834 --> 30:06.679
and Dr. Bull have worked
together in the past.

30:06.788 --> 30:08.437
Is this true, Ms. Lindsay?

30:10.541 --> 30:14.754
I do know Dr. Bull
professionally and socially.

30:15.630 --> 30:17.323
But I swear to you,

30:17.347 --> 30:20.860
I would never and I have never divulged

30:20.884 --> 30:23.329
confidential information about Mr. Reed

30:23.353 --> 30:25.031
or any other client to him.

30:25.055 --> 30:26.332
Or Mr. Colón.

30:26.808 --> 30:28.411
Or anyone else.

30:28.435 --> 30:30.069
I can assure you, Your Honor,

30:30.093 --> 30:33.139
my team discovered the incident
in Rome independently.

30:33.163 --> 30:35.675
And I'm happy to have my employee,

30:35.699 --> 30:37.744
who is a former Homeland Security agent,

30:37.768 --> 30:41.014
provide you with all
the documentation of her search.

30:41.038 --> 30:43.483
Well, I may circle back
and take you up on that offer.

30:43.507 --> 30:46.252
But let me ask you a question, Dr. Bull.

30:46.276 --> 30:50.657
How was it you came to represent
the Harpers in the first place?

30:50.681 --> 30:53.001
We're an awful long way
from New York City.

30:54.419 --> 30:55.962
Actually, I received a call

30:55.986 --> 30:57.363
from an attorney here in Houston.

30:57.387 --> 30:58.588
I asked him to.

30:59.772 --> 31:01.134
You asked him to?

31:01.158 --> 31:04.203
I did, Mr. Powers.

31:04.596 --> 31:05.939
I'm so sorry.

31:06.348 --> 31:07.740
As I'm sure you're aware,

31:07.764 --> 31:09.475
Ms. Lindsay,
this is a very serious violation

31:09.499 --> 31:12.045
of your duty of loyalty to your client.

31:12.069 --> 31:14.681
Now how am I supposed to believe
that you haven't also violated

31:14.705 --> 31:17.016
your duty of confidentiality, as well?

31:17.040 --> 31:19.519
I'm afraid I have no choice
but to refer this matter

31:19.543 --> 31:22.188
to the state bar for disciplinary action.

31:22.212 --> 31:23.423
You understand that?

31:23.447 --> 31:25.391
You may very well be facing suspension,

31:25.415 --> 31:26.849
even disbarment.

31:29.663 --> 31:30.928
I understand.

31:30.952 --> 31:33.333
Your Honor, on behalf
of myself and my colleagues

31:33.357 --> 31:35.786
at my firm, I want to apologize

31:35.810 --> 31:38.538
for this astounding breach of ethics.

31:38.562 --> 31:41.608
And I also want to move for a mistrial.

31:41.632 --> 31:44.277
The jury heard about
that incident in Rome.

31:44.301 --> 31:45.509
You can instruct them to disregard,

31:45.533 --> 31:47.847
but the damage is done.

31:47.871 --> 31:50.336
Actually, Your Honor,
I'm gonna save you the trouble.

31:51.559 --> 31:54.092
Given this turn of events,
I feel that I have no choice

31:54.116 --> 31:56.456
but to discharge my current attorney.

31:56.480 --> 31:59.125
And I think that you will agree
that it's not really fair that

31:59.149 --> 32:01.527
I should have to go out and find
new representation mid-trial.

32:01.551 --> 32:02.680
Your Honor,

32:02.704 --> 32:05.402
any calls for mistrial
is completely unwarranted.

32:05.426 --> 32:06.966
Closing arguments begin tomorrow.

32:06.990 --> 32:08.601
I don't want to hear it, Mr. Colón.

32:08.625 --> 32:10.570
I am granting the mistrial.

32:10.594 --> 32:13.272
And just to be clear,
if there is another trial,

32:13.296 --> 32:16.309
I will not allow any evidence
concerning the incident in Rome.

32:16.333 --> 32:19.879
<i>I asked you</i> point-blank why you were here

32:19.903 --> 32:23.149
and you never once mentioned
that woman's name.

32:23.173 --> 32:25.151
The woman who defended

32:25.175 --> 32:26.986
the man who killed our daughter,

32:27.010 --> 32:29.122
the woman who convinced a
jury to find him innocent.

32:29.146 --> 32:30.990
She had the best of intentions.

32:31.014 --> 32:33.026
We all had the best of intentions.

32:33.050 --> 32:34.827
Mr. Colón is at the courthouse right now

32:34.851 --> 32:36.162
filing for a new trial.

32:36.186 --> 32:38.531
Well, you call him right now
and you tell him to stop.

32:38.555 --> 32:40.631
You and your company
no longer represent us

32:40.655 --> 32:42.001
or the girls.

32:42.025 --> 32:44.170
I am bringing in an attorney from Dallas,

32:44.194 --> 32:46.439
see if there's any way to
salvage this thing at all.

32:46.463 --> 32:47.782
Mr. and Mrs. Harper...

32:47.806 --> 32:49.942
These came just before you arrived.

32:49.966 --> 32:51.811
It says we have to surrender the girls

32:51.835 --> 32:54.103
to Derek in less than 24 hours.

32:54.127 --> 32:57.016
Listen, I know we have failed
you, I know I failed you

32:57.040 --> 32:58.518
and I know you want to make a change,

32:58.542 --> 32:59.786
but please, let me get into this.

32:59.810 --> 33:01.087
Let me talk to the judge.

33:01.111 --> 33:02.410
Let me see what I can do.

33:02.434 --> 33:04.590
I've already seen what you can do,

33:04.614 --> 33:06.048
and you've done enough.

33:17.854 --> 33:19.505
You watching a movie?

33:19.529 --> 33:21.007
Can I show you something?

33:21.031 --> 33:23.576
Didn't you get the bulletin?

33:24.152 --> 33:25.578
Case is over.

33:25.602 --> 33:27.847
The children are going back to their dad,

33:27.871 --> 33:29.315
Victor and Sandy are getting a divorce,

33:29.339 --> 33:31.584
the forecast calls for 40 days
and 40 nights of rain.

33:31.608 --> 33:33.586
I'm trying to keep
a good attitude, but...

33:33.610 --> 33:35.421
What am I about to look at here?

33:35.445 --> 33:37.323
Remember way back when we
were trying to discredit

33:37.347 --> 33:38.791
Derek's story that he didn't know

33:38.815 --> 33:40.727
- Amanda was coming over that night?
- Mm-hmm.

33:40.751 --> 33:42.328
I went and got security footage

33:42.352 --> 33:44.333
from the grocery store
where she got his call.

33:44.357 --> 33:45.410
Okay.

33:45.435 --> 33:46.792
I don't know what I was hoping to find.

33:46.816 --> 33:48.701
Footage of a woman taking a phone call?

33:49.010 --> 33:50.559
But then I found it.

33:55.365 --> 33:56.843
I don't hear anything.

33:56.867 --> 33:58.211
That's because there's no sound.

33:58.235 --> 34:00.680
It's security footage. You don't
need sound to nab shoplifters.

34:00.704 --> 34:03.816
Okay. I'm lost.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.752
I don't understand
the purpose of this exercise.

34:05.776 --> 34:07.520
I was in the middle
of a perfectly good funk.

34:07.544 --> 34:08.878
Nothing suicidal, but still,

34:08.902 --> 34:10.389
dark, tiptoeing toward some form

34:10.413 --> 34:11.690
of self-destruction
and you interrupted me.

34:11.715 --> 34:13.192
Back when I worked at Homeland,

34:13.216 --> 34:16.362
I spent a lot of time looking
at CCTV footage without audio.

34:16.386 --> 34:18.420
And I got really good at lipreading.

34:18.444 --> 34:19.753
So when I saw this...

34:21.056 --> 34:25.371
...I enhanced the video
and, okay, look at her.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.074
She looks worried. I think she's saying,

34:28.098 --> 34:30.576
"Calm down, Honey Bear,
it'll be all right.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.637
I'll be there as soon as I can."

34:36.516 --> 34:39.351
Who calls their ex
they're in a custody battle with

34:39.376 --> 34:41.053
- "Honey Bear"?
- Exactly.

34:41.077 --> 34:44.422
I don't think Derek called
Amanda, I think Lila did.

34:44.447 --> 34:46.025
Which makes me wonder,

34:46.443 --> 34:48.353
if Lila was so upset

34:48.378 --> 34:50.996
that her mom felt she had
to rush to her side,

34:51.021 --> 34:54.960
do we honestly feel that she
would be asleep 15 minutes later

34:54.985 --> 34:56.435
after Amanda showed up?

34:56.458 --> 34:58.204
I need to talk to that little girl.

35:00.619 --> 35:03.942
Lila, you've seen me
around here, haven't you?

35:04.962 --> 35:06.360
I'm a friend of your grandparents.

35:07.964 --> 35:11.372
You know, a lot of people
are trying to figure out

35:11.885 --> 35:14.275
where you and your sister should live,

35:14.299 --> 35:15.717
and I would like to know what you think.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.405
Hmm? I know, it's,

35:19.601 --> 35:22.395
it's hard to say what you want sometimes.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.815
Maybe you don't want
to hurt anyone's feelings?

35:38.216 --> 35:39.750
Maybe you're scared?

35:41.998 --> 35:43.797
Does this guy have a name?

35:44.626 --> 35:45.694
Tuxedo.

35:45.718 --> 35:47.629
Oh...

35:48.296 --> 35:50.465
Tuxedo.

35:51.023 --> 35:52.342
Excellent.

35:53.932 --> 35:55.199
You know what people call me?

35:56.805 --> 35:58.431
Bull.

35:58.998 --> 36:01.384
It's my name.
Well, it's kind of a nickname,

36:01.408 --> 36:04.279
because my first name
is actually "Jason."

36:04.303 --> 36:06.615
- Bull.
- Bull.

36:06.639 --> 36:09.117
I know. It's funny.

36:09.692 --> 36:11.687
Your mom had a nickname
for you, didn't she?

36:12.445 --> 36:13.660
Was it...

36:13.684 --> 36:15.090
"Honey Bear"?

36:15.865 --> 36:17.326
Mm.

36:17.951 --> 36:20.085
You loved your mom a lot, didn't you?

36:22.688 --> 36:24.733
You remember the other day,
you got upset,

36:24.757 --> 36:27.919
when your grandma was
yelling at your grandpa?

36:29.254 --> 36:31.130
I think I might know why.

36:32.549 --> 36:35.177
You were scared, weren't you?

36:35.201 --> 36:37.679
Married people, yelling at each other?

36:38.179 --> 36:40.105
It's scary, isn't it?

36:43.226 --> 36:45.228
The last time you saw your mom,

36:47.063 --> 36:50.782
she was yelling at your dad, wasn't she?

36:55.046 --> 36:56.981
Daddy shot Mommy.

37:02.782 --> 37:04.789
You saw it, didn't you?

37:10.253 --> 37:11.947
It's all my fault.

37:11.971 --> 37:13.448
I am the reason she came over.

37:13.472 --> 37:14.916
I called her.

37:15.466 --> 37:18.320
Oh, no, no, no. Lila,

37:19.345 --> 37:21.423
it's what mommies are supposed to do.

37:22.181 --> 37:24.893
They come when we need them.

37:25.268 --> 37:26.769
They were yelling,

37:27.770 --> 37:30.565
and then she came upstairs to get us

37:30.589 --> 37:32.525
and he shot her in the back.

37:33.776 --> 37:37.539
He said if I told, I'd never
see my sister ever again.

37:38.114 --> 37:40.542
Okay. Come here.

37:40.566 --> 37:42.619
It's okay.

37:43.569 --> 37:45.213
It's gonna be okay.

37:48.541 --> 37:51.453
Dr. Bull, Mr. Colón.

37:51.477 --> 37:52.781
I thought my order was quite clear:

37:52.805 --> 37:55.957
the girls were to be returned
to their father's custody <i>today.</i>

37:57.008 --> 37:58.794
Turns out there <i>is</i> a problem, Your Honor.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.395
We have it on good authority

38:00.419 --> 38:03.770
that Mr. Reed is going to be unavailable

38:03.794 --> 38:06.068
to take care of the children
in the near future.

38:06.092 --> 38:07.969
What are you talking about?
That's preposterous.

38:07.993 --> 38:10.072
We had a little chat with
the D.A. this morning,

38:10.096 --> 38:12.446
and he was very interested to hear

38:12.470 --> 38:14.943
that there was a witness
to your wife's murder...

38:15.301 --> 38:17.746
your daughter...
and that you threatened her

38:17.770 --> 38:20.972
so that she would not say what she saw.

38:23.117 --> 38:24.586
Fine.

38:24.610 --> 38:28.323
You can talk to the district
attorney all you want.

38:28.623 --> 38:30.659
Double jeopardy still applies.

38:30.683 --> 38:32.961
I can't be retried for Amanda's death.

38:32.985 --> 38:35.197
Ah, you're right...
you can't be tried again

38:35.221 --> 38:36.898
for your wife's murder.

38:36.922 --> 38:39.434
But you can be tried
for witness tampering.

38:39.458 --> 38:40.825
Gentlemen!

38:42.679 --> 38:45.615
Fun fact: In Texas, if you
tamper with a murder trial,

38:45.639 --> 38:47.987
you get the same punishment
you would have gotten

38:48.011 --> 38:49.144
if you were convicted

38:49.168 --> 38:51.146
of the murder itself. Remind me, Benny,

38:51.170 --> 38:52.514
what is the punishment again?

38:52.538 --> 38:53.982
Life in prison.

38:55.007 --> 38:57.777
Derek Reed, you're under arrest
for witness tampering.

39:01.406 --> 39:03.291
You have the right to remain silent...

39:03.315 --> 39:05.026
Well...

39:05.050 --> 39:07.963
I could've done without the theatrics.

39:07.987 --> 39:10.365
- Eh.
- And I certainly can't condone

39:10.389 --> 39:12.367
how you came to be involved in the case,

39:12.391 --> 39:15.081
but I do believe
that you did what you did

39:15.105 --> 39:16.972
in the best interest of the children.

39:16.996 --> 39:19.063
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you.

39:21.934 --> 39:24.576
You know, Judge, there is someone else

39:24.600 --> 39:28.339
who did what she did... in the
best interests of the children.

39:40.764 --> 39:42.453
I checked out yesterday.

39:45.283 --> 39:46.835
You got my text.

39:46.859 --> 39:48.837
"The worm turned again.

39:48.861 --> 39:50.839
"This time I stepped on him.

39:50.863 --> 39:52.941
"Then I dragged my shoe
along the sidewalk

39:52.965 --> 39:55.944
"till there was nothing left
of him but a dark smear

39:55.968 --> 39:57.579
- on the concrete."
- Hmm.

39:57.603 --> 39:59.414
You're quite the poet.

39:59.438 --> 40:01.650
- Well, it's a gift.
- Mm.

40:02.091 --> 40:03.652
Girls are with their grandparents

40:03.676 --> 40:05.810
and seem... very happy.

40:07.138 --> 40:08.514
Thank you.

40:09.432 --> 40:11.059
Sorry you lost your job.

40:11.434 --> 40:12.928
Well, sometimes you got to choose

40:12.952 --> 40:15.354
between being a good lawyer
or being a good person.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.599
I'll get a new job.

40:17.623 --> 40:20.168
Heck, I might just start my own firm,

40:20.192 --> 40:22.704
if I don't get disbarred first.

40:23.237 --> 40:24.773
That's not gonna happen.

40:24.797 --> 40:25.864
How do you know?

40:28.242 --> 40:29.444
What did you do?

40:30.203 --> 40:32.914
I told the judge that I was
in the doghouse with you,

40:32.938 --> 40:34.382
and it would go a long way

40:34.406 --> 40:37.552
if maybe he could not
press "send" on that e-mail.

40:37.576 --> 40:39.855
And then I appealed
to his sense of fair play,

40:39.879 --> 40:41.857
and then I told him
I'd be thrilled to have his son

40:41.881 --> 40:44.359
do an internship at TAC next year.

40:44.717 --> 40:47.028
That may not have been
the exact order of events.

40:47.804 --> 40:49.096
What are you doing this weekend?

40:50.756 --> 40:54.269
I've heard that line somewhere before.

40:55.853 --> 40:56.938
What's this?

40:56.962 --> 40:58.815
Plane tickets to New York City.

40:59.357 --> 41:00.709
Seat next to mine.

41:00.733 --> 41:03.334
We leave in three and a half hours.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.864
That is, if you want to come.

41:09.775 --> 41:11.077
Please...

41:12.011 --> 41:13.999
just... come.

41:16.998 --> 41:18.994
Think you could get me one
of those internships at TAC?

41:19.489 --> 41:20.833
Well...

41:20.858 --> 41:22.297
I'll put in a good word.

41:22.321 --> 41:23.598
Hmm.

41:23.622 --> 41:26.368
So, a spontaneous weekend
in New York City.

41:26.392 --> 41:28.737
- Mm.
- Sounds great.

41:29.053 --> 41:31.006
What hotel you put me in?

41:31.030 --> 41:32.607
Hotel.

41:32.631 --> 41:34.609
I knew there was something I forgot.
