00:17.376 --> 00:19.820
El Gato!

00:36.700 --> 00:39.367
<b>4x10 - Small Change</b>

00:39.602 --> 00:43.110
Obelisk. Obelisk.
Obelisk, where are you?

00:43.193 --> 00:44.695
Where are you, Obelisk?

00:44.778 --> 00:46.613
Obelisk? Obelisk!

00:46.697 --> 00:48.365
Obelisk. Obelisk. Obelisk.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.367
Obelisk. Obelisk. Obelisk. Obelisk.

00:50.659 --> 00:52.035
Obelisk. Obelisk. Obelisk.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.705
Obelisk. Obelisk. Obelisk.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.171
- Eh. Toby!
- Uh-huh?

01:02.546 --> 01:05.966
Could you make your apple munching
somewhere not so close to my face?

01:07.009 --> 01:08.594
That better?

01:08.677 --> 01:09.803
No.

01:10.262 --> 01:11.555
How about now?

01:12.848 --> 01:17.394
How about you stand over here...
while I work.

01:17.769 --> 01:19.646
Right over here.

01:21.023 --> 01:23.317
No, no, no. Over here.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.069
There. Now, stay put.

01:29.031 --> 01:31.074
Why is this sign facing this way?

01:31.158 --> 01:32.618
It should be facing that way.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.328
Is everything okay, Puss?

01:34.828 --> 01:37.539
Yes, of course.
I have everything under control.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.210
Ouch!

01:41.710 --> 01:44.963
Sorry, one of your whiskers
was marginally longer

01:45.047 --> 01:47.466
than the rest of them,
and it was making me insane!

01:50.010 --> 01:52.346
Now, excuse me, while I continue
to single-handedly

01:52.429 --> 01:55.015
unravel the mystery
that is the Obelisk of Night.

01:55.432 --> 01:57.142
Maybe we could help, Puss?

01:57.226 --> 01:59.061
Yeah, Puss, I could help too!

02:01.522 --> 02:03.857
No. It is as I always say,

02:03.941 --> 02:05.317
"If you want something done right,

02:05.400 --> 02:08.027
you must do it in a very specific
and arbitrary way."

02:08.110 --> 02:11.698
You've had a specific way
for everything lately.

02:11.782 --> 02:14.785
Do not be ridiculous.

02:15.619 --> 02:20.165
I know you feel a little, I don't know,
helpless to defeat the Bloodwolf.

02:20.374 --> 02:23.544
And sometimes, when we feel
out of control about one thing,

02:23.627 --> 02:25.337
we over-control other things.

02:25.796 --> 02:28.340
Do you think that's something
you may be doing?

02:28.423 --> 02:30.008
No.

02:30.300 --> 02:32.803
Wait a minute.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.681
That symbol looks so familiar.

02:36.265 --> 02:38.642
I wonder where I've seen that before.

02:39.685 --> 02:43.438
Oh. It looks like one
of Sphinx's tattoos, doesn't it?

02:46.733 --> 02:48.026
Yes! Of course.

02:52.823 --> 02:53.991
Sphinx! Sphinx!

02:55.575 --> 02:56.660
What? What?

02:56.743 --> 02:57.995
Where is it? Where is it?

02:58.078 --> 02:59.246
- I need to see it. Now!
- Huh?

02:59.329 --> 03:01.373
Where is what? What are you talking about?

03:01.456 --> 03:03.166
The symbol. Where is the symbol?

03:03.250 --> 03:04.334
Is it down here?

03:04.418 --> 03:07.004
What symbol? Hey, watch it.

03:08.171 --> 03:11.216
That tickles. Knock it off.
Quit it, guy. Come on.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.427
You're totally violating
my personal space.

03:13.510 --> 03:15.429
Stand still. You're making this difficult.

03:15.512 --> 03:17.264
Seriously, bro, get off me.

03:17.347 --> 03:19.266
No, not until I find it.

03:19.349 --> 03:22.269
Show me. Where is it? Where is the symbol?

03:22.352 --> 03:24.563
Dude, I don't know
what you're talking about.

03:24.855 --> 03:25.939
Uh, Puss?

03:29.151 --> 03:31.945
Puss, look at her shoulder.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.161
Huzzah! I have found it.

03:39.244 --> 03:41.204
Where did you obtain this tattoo?
Tell me now.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.540
Oh, this? Oh, Callista gave it to me.

03:44.166 --> 03:45.709
Callista?

03:45.792 --> 03:48.545
You know, my sister
who terrorizes Fountainwood?

03:48.629 --> 03:51.882
Looks exactly like me?
Literally set you on fire?

03:51.965 --> 03:54.009
Yeah. She inked me back
when we were still young

03:54.092 --> 03:56.011
and didn't hate each other and stuff.

03:56.595 --> 03:58.680
- Wait. Fountainwood?
- Yeah.

03:58.764 --> 04:00.974
- The forest with the magical fountains?
- Yeah.

04:01.058 --> 04:02.643
With the waters
that cause strange effects?

04:02.726 --> 04:04.645
- Yeah.
- And you have to say release

04:04.728 --> 04:08.106
- to break the spell?
- Dude, yes, okay? That's the place.

04:08.190 --> 04:11.401
Then to Fountainwood we go.
We leave at once.

04:11.735 --> 04:13.403
Yay! I'll go get ready.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.989
What? No, no, no. Toby, you stay.

04:16.531 --> 04:18.408
Aw. But I wanna go.

04:18.492 --> 04:22.287
No. Artephius! Pack a bag
with provisions for our journey.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.998
I am on it like a bonnet.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.462
That can't be good for my back.

04:46.478 --> 04:48.105
Okay, team, let's noodle a plan

04:48.188 --> 04:51.483
so that Callista doesn't incinerate
us to bits. I was thinking that...

04:51.566 --> 04:54.403
No thinking will be done
by anyone who is not me.

04:54.486 --> 04:56.988
We do it my way. Here's the plan.

04:57.072 --> 04:59.741
We force Callista to tell us everything
about the Obelisk of Night,

04:59.825 --> 05:02.119
and then I defeat the Bloodwolf. The end.

05:02.202 --> 05:03.203
Hmm.

05:03.286 --> 05:07.207
But what happens when she eats your bones
because she's, like, a savage beast?

05:07.290 --> 05:10.919
That will not happen. Trust me.
I have everything under control...

05:11.002 --> 05:12.003
Halt, intruder!

05:18.719 --> 05:21.430
So not an intruder, dummy.
I'm your sister?

05:21.513 --> 05:23.098
Ugh. Even worse.

05:27.269 --> 05:29.062
- Toby?
- On it.

05:41.783 --> 05:42.701
Ow.

05:55.130 --> 05:57.257
Dulcinea?

05:57.340 --> 05:59.092
Artephius?

06:00.051 --> 06:01.553
Toby?

06:16.151 --> 06:17.486
Whoa. Whoa.

06:19.196 --> 06:21.740
Hey! Paws. Stop with the hitting.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.621
No, no, no. I had everything under...

06:28.914 --> 06:30.040
...control.

06:42.219 --> 06:44.095
Those are, like, my friends.

06:46.848 --> 06:48.892
Yeah, right. You don't have any friends.

06:49.476 --> 06:50.602
Yes, I do.

07:00.779 --> 07:01.655
Hmm? Huh?

07:07.035 --> 07:09.246
Hello?

07:10.455 --> 07:13.250
I hate your stupid face!

07:13.875 --> 07:16.753
We're twins.
We have the same face!

07:20.882 --> 07:21.716
Hello?

07:22.843 --> 07:25.220
Puss?

07:25.303 --> 07:26.680
Dulcinea?

07:32.435 --> 07:34.646
Hello, little piggy.

07:36.273 --> 07:39.401
Stay back. I'm overly gassy
for my age and height.

07:39.484 --> 07:43.280
No need to unleash
your flatulence on us, little piggy.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.532
We can help you find your friends.

07:45.615 --> 07:47.534
You... You can?

07:47.617 --> 07:51.955
Oh, sure. Right after
you help make us rich.

08:10.181 --> 08:11.224
Whoa!

08:11.808 --> 08:13.852
Release. Rele...

08:19.149 --> 08:20.984
My body is not doing as I command.

08:23.695 --> 08:28.033
Artephius, did you also fall into what is
apparently the Fountain of Handstands?

08:28.116 --> 08:30.577
Nope. I fell into the Fountain
of Achy Back.

08:30.660 --> 08:31.620
See?

08:31.703 --> 08:34.080
Oh. Strange fountain. No water in it.

08:34.164 --> 08:36.582
Are you sure you did not just
fall on the ground?

08:37.207 --> 08:38.168
Oh!

08:38.251 --> 08:43.048
That just might explain why it was dry.
And It was hard. And it was the ground.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.008
Release!

08:45.091 --> 08:49.638
I do not understand. I repeat "release,"
yet the spell is unbroken.

08:49.721 --> 08:53.600
You and me both, sister.
Release! Release! Re...

08:53.683 --> 08:55.143
Oh-ho-ho!

08:55.226 --> 08:57.103
Yep. Definitely fell on the ground.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.984
Every time... I start hiccuping...

09:03.068 --> 09:04.444
...my spell changes.

09:04.736 --> 09:05.820
I cannot control it.

09:05.904 --> 09:07.822
Changing spells, huh?

09:07.906 --> 09:09.532
That can only mean one thing.

09:09.616 --> 09:14.663
It looks like you've fallen
into the Fountain of 100 Changes.

09:14.746 --> 09:17.749
Did you say "100 changes"?

09:17.832 --> 09:20.377
One hundred changes.

09:21.169 --> 09:23.630
Like a one, with two zeros after?

09:23.713 --> 09:25.090
Yes, siree.

09:25.173 --> 09:28.843
You have to go through a hundred random
changes before the spell ends.

09:28.927 --> 09:31.137
Ooh. And wait, there's more.

09:31.221 --> 09:35.433
It's the only spell in Fountainwood
that saying "release" doesn't fix.

09:35.517 --> 09:37.185
There's no way to control it.

09:37.769 --> 09:40.188
This is unacceptable. For...

09:42.732 --> 09:45.694
This is an insult to boots everywhere.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.119
This sure was a good idea,

09:54.202 --> 09:58.248
sneaking into Fountainwood
when that scary cat lady is preoccupied.

09:58.665 --> 10:02.669
And bottling up the fountain water
to sell for profit.

10:02.752 --> 10:05.880
What's that got to do with me?

10:06.548 --> 10:08.425
Since the fountains are not labeled,

10:08.508 --> 10:11.302
we'll have to try them out
on someone first.

10:11.386 --> 10:15.724
But where are you going to find
someone around... Oh, boy.

10:22.147 --> 10:25.066
- What's happening? Oh, it tickles!
- Whoa.

10:26.776 --> 10:27.819
Oh! Ooh.

10:27.902 --> 10:29.863
I'm so manly.

10:31.489 --> 10:37.287
Wow! The Fountain of Mustaches.
Oh, this is going to be a huge hit.

10:38.788 --> 10:41.332
Nothing has gone according to my plan.

10:41.416 --> 10:43.626
I have been cursed
with an impossible spell.

10:43.710 --> 10:47.172
The Sphinx is going to get eaten,
Toby and Dulcinea have gone missing,

10:47.255 --> 10:49.591
and we will never find the obelisk.

10:49.674 --> 10:52.302
Oh, it's not all bad.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.637
No, wait. Yes, it is.

10:56.097 --> 10:58.266
I wish to hop no more.

10:58.349 --> 11:01.269
There must be some way
to control this spell.

11:01.352 --> 11:03.480
Nope, you've just gotta accept it.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.565
I will not!

11:09.486 --> 11:10.445
Hmm.

11:14.157 --> 11:15.909
Wo ist das Katzenklo?

11:26.002 --> 11:27.253
Ooh!

11:29.631 --> 11:32.258
Whoa!

11:43.353 --> 11:44.979
- What the...
- Huh?

11:54.697 --> 11:56.658
Whoa!

12:07.460 --> 12:08.294
Dulcinea.

12:08.878 --> 12:10.213
You're all right!

12:10.296 --> 12:12.131
Oh, I'm better than all right.

12:12.549 --> 12:13.925
I'm the best.

12:14.050 --> 12:17.554
And don't you forget it, Kitty Dum Dum.

12:17.637 --> 12:18.596
Snaps.

12:18.680 --> 12:21.391
I, uh... I thought
we retired that nickname.

12:21.766 --> 12:25.603
She must have fallen into
the Fountain of Sass Mouth, Puss.

12:25.687 --> 12:29.732
It'll turn even the sweetest kitty
into one sassy Sally.

12:29.816 --> 12:30.942
No, no.

12:31.025 --> 12:34.153
A sassy Dulcinea is yet one more thing
I cannot control.

12:37.949 --> 12:39.200
Huh?

12:46.374 --> 12:49.085
Dulcinea, there is no time
for cheeky hijinks.

12:50.628 --> 12:54.799
San Lorenzo is depending on us.
You must say "release" at once!

12:55.300 --> 12:58.845
Hmm. I think... not.

12:58.928 --> 13:00.013
Boop.

13:04.309 --> 13:05.310
Dulcine...

13:06.686 --> 13:07.896
Dulcinea.

13:07.979 --> 13:09.814
Come back this instant.

13:13.359 --> 13:15.820
Hey. Watch where you're going.

13:15.904 --> 13:18.239
Uh-huh. You watch where you're going.

13:18.948 --> 13:20.700
What? How dare you!

13:20.783 --> 13:23.578
Halt.
Puss in Boots commands it.

13:23.661 --> 13:26.456
Hey. Why is your voice so funny?

13:26.539 --> 13:28.666
Why is your face so funny?

13:28.750 --> 13:30.585
My face isn't funny.

13:35.465 --> 13:40.053
Antonio, no! Not your beautiful face.
I will avenge you.

13:40.136 --> 13:43.097
Ha! You're gonna avenge him wearing that?

13:43.181 --> 13:44.891
What's wrong with my outfit?

13:44.974 --> 13:49.312
Oh, nothing. It's just sooo last season.

13:49.812 --> 13:52.732
Masks never go out of style.

13:53.232 --> 13:54.609
They do now.

13:58.404 --> 14:01.908
Honest voice or not,
I am still a force to be reckoned with.

14:01.991 --> 14:03.618
Took you long enough.

14:03.701 --> 14:05.912
Look, I'm snapping, too.

14:05.995 --> 14:08.206
Do not sashay away from me.

14:08.289 --> 14:09.791
I'm leading this...

14:09.874 --> 14:10.875
Uh-oh.

14:13.044 --> 14:14.128
Whoa.

14:14.212 --> 14:16.339
I am in control!

14:16.631 --> 14:17.799
Whoa!

14:19.259 --> 14:21.678
All right, pig boy.
Time to try out this one.

14:21.761 --> 14:24.764
Say "release" and the mustache
spell will wear off.

14:25.807 --> 14:29.310
Aw, but I like the mustache.
Can I keep it?

14:29.394 --> 14:31.604
No! Say "release" quickly.

14:33.022 --> 14:34.399
Release!

14:37.068 --> 14:38.486
Afternoon, ladies.

14:39.821 --> 14:40.697
Look.

14:40.780 --> 14:44.867
Toby! Puss in Boots to the rescue.

14:44.951 --> 14:48.538
Really? Who talks
in the third person anymore?

14:48.621 --> 14:50.873
Artephius has no idea.

14:54.085 --> 14:56.754
All right, little piggy.
Here's the next one.

15:05.847 --> 15:07.807
Ah! Fountain of Burps.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.642
Aw.

15:09.726 --> 15:12.478
I miss...
my mustache.

15:12.562 --> 15:15.648
Unhand that gassy piggy at once.

15:17.775 --> 15:19.569
You do not want to mess...

15:19.652 --> 15:22.780
Hey, nerds. I'm back.

15:22.864 --> 15:25.450
Oh, no. It's that sassy lady.

15:25.533 --> 15:27.452
Let's get out of here
before she makes more snide comments.

15:27.535 --> 15:28.536
No!

15:29.120 --> 15:32.832
Dulcinea. Stand back.
I have got this under control.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.209
Why is he juggling?

15:35.293 --> 15:36.961
And with such skill.

15:37.045 --> 15:38.212
It is amusing.

15:38.296 --> 15:41.341
Ha! I hope you are as amused
by my fists when...

15:49.766 --> 15:51.559
You were saying?

15:51.642 --> 15:53.686
I hate this.

15:54.896 --> 15:57.648
Dulcinea, do not just stand there.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.150
Ha-ha-ha!

15:59.233 --> 16:02.320
Funny. I didn't hear you say "please."

16:02.403 --> 16:04.530
Hiccup. Hiccup. Hiccup. Hiccup. Hiccup.

16:07.033 --> 16:09.911
Yes, well, like I was saying.

16:09.994 --> 16:13.206
Give us the pig boy
and no harm will come to you.

16:15.625 --> 16:16.793
Please?

16:16.876 --> 16:19.754
Pretty please? With cherries?
And whipped crema?

16:19.837 --> 16:21.798
Anybody know how to fix an achy back?

16:24.801 --> 16:25.676
Ow!

16:26.719 --> 16:29.013
You did it. My hero.

16:29.097 --> 16:31.307
Get off. Affection gives me the hives.

16:33.518 --> 16:34.727
What the...

16:36.979 --> 16:37.814
Uh...

16:37.897 --> 16:39.357
What is he doing?

16:48.991 --> 16:52.078
It is a fight we want. Not a dance.

16:52.161 --> 16:54.080
Believe me. I want that too.

17:06.675 --> 17:07.676
Ew.

17:15.309 --> 17:16.310
Wait a moment.

17:16.394 --> 17:18.896
- Dancing is just fighting with music.
- Whoo!

17:18.980 --> 17:22.023
Is it possible that I could use
this spell to my advantage?

17:23.358 --> 17:27.738
Perhaps a willingness to accept change
could be a strength.

17:33.244 --> 17:36.330
He's having a revelation
about his internal conflict.

17:36.414 --> 17:38.166
Sometimes the obstacle is...

17:38.249 --> 17:40.126
Enough of your philosophical musings.

17:40.209 --> 17:41.711
Let us dance-fight.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.297
Ha!

17:49.760 --> 17:50.803
Ha-ha!

18:09.655 --> 18:10.781
What?

18:10.865 --> 18:12.200
Where'd he go?

18:12.283 --> 18:14.660
I am right here. Invisible.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.838
- He's magic.
- Save us!

18:28.424 --> 18:30.843
That was so awesome!

18:30.927 --> 18:33.179
Even the part where I
couldn't see you, Puss.

18:33.262 --> 18:35.181
Thank you, Toby.

18:35.264 --> 18:37.433
Let us continue our mission
and find some...

18:44.065 --> 18:45.066
- Got ya, bro.
- Whoa!

18:46.150 --> 18:47.652
Now, where is she?

18:47.735 --> 18:51.948
Sphinx. Callista. Stop it.
Stop fighting.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.950
I'll stop when she stops.

18:54.033 --> 18:57.078
Why do I have to stop? It's your fault.
You started this.

18:57.161 --> 18:59.205
Why are you always blaming me?

18:59.288 --> 19:00.665
Callista, please.

19:00.748 --> 19:04.335
We just want to ask you
about the tattoo on Sphinx.

19:04.418 --> 19:08.172
Then why don't you talk to the loser
who spends her life making up riddles?

19:08.256 --> 19:10.633
It's a job, okay?

19:10.716 --> 19:12.552
Whoa!

19:12.635 --> 19:14.762
Ow, ow. My tail is very sensitive.

19:33.364 --> 19:34.282
No!

19:37.451 --> 19:39.912
Dulcinea, we cannot let
the Sphinx hurt Callista.

19:39.996 --> 19:41.789
We desperately need information from her.

19:41.872 --> 19:43.833
Tell the dirt you love it!

19:43.916 --> 19:45.960
Dulcinea, only you have the sensitivity

19:46.043 --> 19:48.588
to resolve this kind
of emotional family conflict.

19:48.671 --> 19:52.550
But you cannot do it if you're sassy.
You must say "release!"

19:52.633 --> 19:55.970
Pass, pass, I'm-ma keep the sass.

19:56.053 --> 19:59.098
Please, Dulcinea. Do it for San Lorenzo.

19:59.181 --> 20:01.017
Do it for me.

20:01.684 --> 20:05.521
Ugh! Okay, fine.
But Toby has to say it too, because...

20:05.605 --> 20:06.856
Eww.

20:07.773 --> 20:08.774
<i>Release!</i>

20:14.947 --> 20:16.616
I forgot that part.

20:17.366 --> 20:20.286
Aw! My back hurts again.

20:24.665 --> 20:27.877
Ladies. Ladies, what's this about?

20:31.464 --> 20:34.175
One at a time, please. Callista?

20:34.258 --> 20:36.302
- Well...
- Why does she get to go first?

20:36.385 --> 20:38.888
Ever since she was little
she's always gone first.

20:38.971 --> 20:42.308
What? That is so not true.
You're such a liar.

20:42.391 --> 20:43.684
- You're the liar.
- I can't stand talking to you.

20:43.768 --> 20:46.103
- Well, good. I don't want...
- Ladies, please.

20:46.187 --> 20:48.064
Okay, Sphinx, you first.

20:48.731 --> 20:50.941
My whole life,
she's been like the worst to me.

20:51.025 --> 20:53.444
I can't help it if I want
to punch her in her dumb face.

20:53.527 --> 20:57.490
Mm-hmm. I see. Callista?
How do you feel about this?

20:57.573 --> 21:00.451
I was only mean to her because
mom and dad liked her better.

21:00.534 --> 21:02.495
No way. They liked you better.

21:02.578 --> 21:05.539
[in unison] They always said,
"Be more like your sister."

21:05.623 --> 21:06.666
<i>Huh?</i>

21:18.761 --> 21:21.847
I guess... we were both wrong.

21:21.931 --> 21:26.394
Hey, like, I'm sorry about your toothbrush
and, like, everything else.

21:26.477 --> 21:28.479
Oh, it's cool. I don't brush anyway.

21:28.562 --> 21:29.647
Duh.

21:30.231 --> 21:34.402
This is good. Very cathartic.
Why don't you two hug and make up?

21:35.319 --> 21:39.115
Or whatever that was, yeah, sure.

21:39.198 --> 21:42.451
Callista, we have traveled a long way

21:42.535 --> 21:44.745
to ask you the meaning of this symbol.

21:46.872 --> 21:49.875
Oh, that? I saw it
on an old obelisk years ago.

21:49.959 --> 21:52.420
The Obelisk of Night?

21:53.045 --> 21:56.132
Maybe. It was at this place called
the Grotto of Riches.

21:56.215 --> 21:58.300
Really fancy cave full of treasure.

21:58.384 --> 22:01.637
If we can find this grotto,
we can save San Lorenzo.

22:01.721 --> 22:04.807
"We"? Are you sure you don't mean you?

22:06.100 --> 22:08.227
Yes. We. Together.

22:08.310 --> 22:10.980
I will never again try to control...

22:11.355 --> 22:12.356
Seriously?

22:15.526 --> 22:17.194
I hate this spell.

22:17.695 --> 22:19.738
Fountain of 100 Changes, huh?

22:19.739 --> 22:21.782
That one is the worst, am I right?

22:21.866 --> 22:25.035
You know what? Maybe a little
change will be good for me.
