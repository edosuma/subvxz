00:28.445 --> 00:30.739
[Lady Whistledown]
Dearest gentle reader,

00:30.822 --> 00:33.366
I must send felicitations

00:33.450 --> 00:36.411
to the new Duke and Duchess of Hastings.

00:37.370 --> 00:41.624
Congratulations and stamina
as they embark

00:41.708 --> 00:45.462
on the most exhilarating time
in a young couple's life.

00:47.881 --> 00:52.302
I am, of course, talking of the honeymoon.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.264
[horses neighing]

01:19.079 --> 01:21.915
Is there a more romantic notion?

01:22.499 --> 01:25.126
-To retreat from society together…
-Good morning.

01:25.210 --> 01:28.922
-…finally leaving watchful eyes behind.
-Good morning.

01:35.887 --> 01:38.181
Welcome to Clyvedon, Your Grace.

01:38.264 --> 01:39.682
It has been so long

01:39.766 --> 01:41.601
since we have been blessed
with your presence,

01:41.684 --> 01:43.686
but I trust
you will find everything to your liking.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.231
I do not doubt it, Mrs. Colson.
I hope you have been well.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.148
Mm.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.859
May I introduce to you
the Duchess of Hastings?

01:50.693 --> 01:53.488
I am looking forward
to making your acquaintance, Mrs. Colson.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.198
Thank you, Your Grace.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.909
I have planned everything
to make you both comfortable.

01:57.992 --> 02:00.411
First, a light meal,
served on the terrace.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.414
Then a tour to show you
all the improvements I have made. Then--

02:03.498 --> 02:06.543
I am sure it will be most diverting,
but I am afraid it will have to wait.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.129
I have plans of my own for my new bride.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.172
Mm.

02:11.798 --> 02:12.632
Mm.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.766
[chuckles]

02:21.850 --> 02:23.184
I want to show you the bedroom.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.271
Yours or mine?

02:26.354 --> 02:28.982
You truly believe
we are to have separate rooms?

02:29.983 --> 02:31.276
I should think not.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.361
[both chuckling] Stop! They shall see!

02:33.444 --> 02:35.113
Whatever will they think?

02:35.196 --> 02:36.156
Does it matter?

02:37.031 --> 02:38.366
[Daphne laughs]

02:38.449 --> 02:39.492
[Simon laughs]

02:41.536 --> 02:44.455
[Lady Whistledown] While this author,
along with the rest of the ton,

02:44.539 --> 02:47.792
will certainly miss
its most-remarked-upon couple

02:47.876 --> 02:48.918
back in London,

02:49.002 --> 02:50.670
perhaps we might find solace

02:50.753 --> 02:56.176
in the promise of the duke and duchess
returning to us bearing a surprise.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.428
[crowd chattering]

02:58.553 --> 03:00.972
I wonder what Daphne is doing
at this very moment.

03:01.055 --> 03:04.100
I am sure she has many new duties
to attend to as duchess,

03:04.184 --> 03:05.894
things you should be learning
for your debut.

03:05.977 --> 03:06.853
[Eloise scoffs]

03:06.936 --> 03:08.771
Making simpering conversation,
pretending not to wince

03:08.855 --> 03:10.607
every time a man treads
on my toes during a waltz?

03:10.690 --> 03:12.150
-Eloise!
-I'm no good at those things.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.568
I'll only make a fool of myself.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.904
If you devoted as much time
to your deportment lessons

03:15.987 --> 03:18.573
as you did to writing in your journal,
you might feel rather better.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.950
And on that subject,
in preparation for your season,

03:21.034 --> 03:23.244
it is time we lowered your skirts
to wear at home.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.038
I have no time
for a visit to the modiste.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.122
I am busy.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.042
The queen herself has charged me
with discovering Whistledown's identity.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.419
You would not have me cross
Her Majesty, would you?

03:31.502 --> 03:34.422
-[glass clanging]
-May I have everyone's attention?

03:37.967 --> 03:40.261
I would like to make a small
but important announcement.

03:42.430 --> 03:43.932
I have happy news to impart.

03:46.267 --> 03:50.772
I have asked Miss Marina Thompson
to be my wife, and she has accepted.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.190
[guests exclaim happily]

03:53.942 --> 03:54.859
[applause]

04:02.033 --> 04:03.243
[woman] Congratulations!

04:03.326 --> 04:05.286
[guests laughing, chattering]

04:05.787 --> 04:06.663
[man] Bravo, sir!

04:07.872 --> 04:09.290
Did you know about this?

04:10.541 --> 04:11.876
People are looking, dear.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.587
Congratulate the happy couple.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.972
You barely know the young lady.
What were you thinking?

04:24.055 --> 04:26.975
I was thinking you'd respond like this
and how little I would care to hear.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.686
Do you think this is a joke?
Poor Mother was beside herself.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.897
Mother seems perfectly happy to me.
She congratulated us.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.025
So, you compromised this young lady?

04:36.109 --> 04:38.945
-Certainly not. I am a gentleman.
-Then why ever would you--

04:39.028 --> 04:40.738
Why does anyone marry, brother?

04:41.489 --> 04:42.490
For love, of course.

04:42.573 --> 04:46.786
Look, I know you are still rather green,
and that is my fault.

04:46.869 --> 04:49.247
I should've taken you to brothels
when you returned from Eton.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.082
If this is a matter
of wetting your wick--

04:51.165 --> 04:52.542
You are an ass. Do you know that?

04:52.625 --> 04:55.169
This is what comes
of not sowing your wild oats.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.171
Proposing to the first chit
you set your cap at.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.256
Enough!

04:59.257 --> 05:01.217
You insult me and my intended.

05:01.301 --> 05:05.513
It is not my fault, nor Marina's,
that you cannot fathom true attachment.

05:06.347 --> 05:09.142
-You are still a child, Colin.
-I'm older than Daphne.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.352
-You were happy to marry her off.
-It is not the same.

05:11.436 --> 05:14.147
-I know nothing of the sort.
-Then you betray your immaturity!

05:14.897 --> 05:18.776
If I caused Mother discomfort today,
I am sorry for it.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.695
I shall speak with her.

05:20.778 --> 05:24.907
The truth is, I do not require
your permission to marry Miss Thompson…

05:25.992 --> 05:28.828
but I would very much prefer
to have your blessing.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.621
Then I am afraid I must disappoint you.

05:31.706 --> 05:32.582
You have…

05:34.208 --> 05:35.418
in more ways than one.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.714
[door opens, closes]

05:39.797 --> 05:41.799
[theme music plays]

05:48.056 --> 05:50.183
I believe I now know the reason

05:50.266 --> 05:54.437
why every mama of the ton keeps
her daughter in total darkness

05:54.520 --> 05:57.565
about certain… diversions.

05:57.648 --> 05:59.025
[Simon] Mm.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.109
Do you?

06:00.193 --> 06:03.363
[chuckles] Should they have told us
what it was truly like,

06:03.446 --> 06:06.366
however would we get
anything else done at all?

06:06.449 --> 06:07.533
[laughs]

06:07.617 --> 06:09.619
-[Simon kissing]
-[moans lightly]

06:10.536 --> 06:12.663
-I must go.
-Mm.

06:12.747 --> 06:16.334
If I am to be duchess of all of this,
I must start learning the lie of the land.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.795
You are already duchess of all this.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.421
-[Simon chuckles]
-And I look forward

06:20.505 --> 06:23.132
to exploring that particular land further…

06:24.717 --> 06:26.219
-Later.
-[both laughing]

06:26.302 --> 06:27.261
Simon!

06:27.345 --> 06:29.430
You said the duchy was most intimidating.

06:29.514 --> 06:34.644
Why not stay and lord it over this room?
You may find it a bit more titillating.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.979
[laughs] I do not doubt it.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.440
But I suspect
Mrs. Colson shall always resent me

06:39.524 --> 06:40.900
if I do not take her tour.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.276
[whispering] Then let her resent.

06:43.861 --> 06:44.862
[Simon moans lightly]

06:44.946 --> 06:47.031
I shall do nothing of the sort.

06:47.115 --> 06:50.618
My mother told me a lady is nothing
without her housekeeper.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.829
I must make a good impression,

06:52.912 --> 06:55.581
or nothing
in this house shall run smoothly.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.586
Then I wish you well.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.632
-Your Grace.
-Your Grace.

07:04.715 --> 07:05.842
[chuckles]

07:06.884 --> 07:08.886
[door opens, closes]

07:08.970 --> 07:10.888
[knocking, door opens]

07:13.433 --> 07:16.227
I have prepared the study
for you to work, Your Grace.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.771
Jeffries, I am on my honeymoon.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.691
The steward has left the records
in some disarray.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.652
I cannot make head nor tail
of the estate's accounting,

07:24.735 --> 07:26.195
and there are several letters

07:26.279 --> 07:28.823
from farm tenants begging
an audience with Your Grace.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.658
Very well! [groans]

07:30.741 --> 07:31.576
If I must.

07:34.745 --> 07:38.666
The castle was built in 1706
for Admiral Thomas,

07:39.167 --> 07:41.627
a gift from Her Majesty Queen Anne--

07:41.711 --> 07:45.339
For his military triumphs
against the French, I believe.

07:45.423 --> 07:49.302
My younger sister Hyacinth
is something of a student of history.

07:49.385 --> 07:51.220
Very well, Your Grace. Here we are.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.931
The morning room,
where the former duchess

07:54.015 --> 07:55.600
preferred to take tea with visitors.

07:55.683 --> 07:59.103
My mama suggested
I extend an invitation to the vicar first.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.398
-I believe she is right.
-Of course, Your Grace.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.109
I look forward to hosting our first ball.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.403
But I believe it would be prudent to wait

08:07.487 --> 08:10.072
until after the close
of the London season, yes?

08:11.365 --> 08:12.909
Indeed, Your Grace.

08:13.701 --> 08:14.577
[chuckles]

08:14.660 --> 08:17.622
And I shall look
at redecorating this room first.

08:18.456 --> 08:19.957
You wish to redecorate?

08:21.083 --> 08:22.418
Certainly, Your Grace.

08:23.252 --> 08:25.505
There is to be a fair
in the village this week.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.798
I offered it patronage on your behalf.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.176
Most thoughtful of you, Mrs. Colson.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.346
Perhaps we might give the servants
some time off to attend as well.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.889
There is much to be done

08:34.972 --> 08:37.183
now that the duke
and yourself are in residence.

08:37.266 --> 08:40.520
Ah. Well, even more reason
to allow them some respite, then.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.190
Is that…?

08:44.690 --> 08:47.109
The former duchess, yes.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.695
-She was beautiful.
-Thoughtful, too.

08:49.779 --> 08:50.947
Most proper.

08:51.822 --> 08:53.574
A perfect duchess.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.493
Hmm.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.378
And here is the nursery.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.260
[chuckles lightly]

09:13.219 --> 09:14.053
Your Grace?

09:14.929 --> 09:16.597
-It is lovely.
-Mm.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.225
Shall we move on?

09:20.142 --> 09:22.186
I am certain there is much left to see.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.939
Yes, of course.
Let me show you your grounds.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.331
[Simon] My apologies. I--

09:44.584 --> 09:46.127
Are we expecting royalty?

09:47.128 --> 09:50.798
Begging your pardon, Your Grace.
The late duke preferred a formal table.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.051
-But if you prefer--
-No.

09:54.635 --> 09:55.803
No, never mind.

10:03.561 --> 10:08.816
Mrs. Colson's tour today was exceptional.
The gardens are particularly lovely.

10:08.899 --> 10:12.320
I found myself
in continual awe of their beauty.

10:16.365 --> 10:17.199
Is anything wrong?

10:17.783 --> 10:19.035
[scoffs] You…

10:19.785 --> 10:21.245
You are so far away.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.164
[chuckles] Well…

10:23.706 --> 10:25.207
Well, that is easily remedied.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.461
It is no trouble, truly.

10:28.544 --> 10:29.503
[chuckles]

10:31.380 --> 10:32.882
[Simon clears throat]

10:43.017 --> 10:45.144
There, now. Much better, yes?

10:48.064 --> 10:50.608
I thought perhaps
to redecorate a few rooms

10:50.691 --> 10:52.401
but wished to talk to you first.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.279
I'd hate to change anything
you're particularly attached to.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.865
Then you may change it all.
In fact, please do.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.867
[chuckles] Now, do not jest.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.494
You must have fond memories…

11:02.453 --> 11:05.373
or sentimental attachments.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.917
After all,
this has been your home for many years.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.043
Do what you will.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.920
Paper the drawing room
in flamingo-pink tulle.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.296
I am sure I shall love it.

11:12.380 --> 11:15.508
You do know,
you need not dress so formally here.

11:19.428 --> 11:22.682
Does this meet your approval?

11:23.182 --> 11:25.101
Oh, without question.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.227
[Daphne chuckles]

11:29.647 --> 11:30.564
[sighs]

11:31.649 --> 11:33.734
Your Grace, should we…

11:34.944 --> 11:36.153
go upstairs?

11:36.237 --> 11:37.488
I have a better idea.

11:38.489 --> 11:42.076
[both laughing]

11:42.660 --> 11:44.161
Where are we going?

11:44.245 --> 11:45.079
Out.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.124
[Daphne laughing]

11:56.132 --> 11:58.592
[thunder crackles]

12:00.761 --> 12:02.763
[both laughing]

12:12.982 --> 12:14.275
[Simon laughing]

12:34.587 --> 12:37.131
[Daphne gasping, moaning]

12:44.680 --> 12:46.307
Do you like this?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.186
Tell me what you want.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.021
[shuddering breaths]

12:52.104 --> 12:53.063
I want…

12:56.358 --> 12:57.234
you.

13:04.784 --> 13:08.120
[thunder booms]

13:09.789 --> 13:11.457
[both gasping, moaning]

13:19.381 --> 13:21.467
[Daphne moaning loudly]

13:28.432 --> 13:30.851
[laughs, panting]

13:35.856 --> 13:36.899
What?

13:38.025 --> 13:39.485
Does that hurt?

13:39.568 --> 13:41.237
-[laughs]
-When you…

13:41.821 --> 13:42.696
No.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.449
I feel as you feel,

13:45.533 --> 13:47.618
absolutely wonderful.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.334
[classical music playing]

14:15.896 --> 14:17.898
[classical music continues]

14:20.067 --> 14:21.694
[gasping]

14:22.152 --> 14:24.738
[moaning lightly]

14:27.533 --> 14:29.994
[gasping]

14:30.828 --> 14:31.662
Wait!

14:31.745 --> 14:34.206
Wait! Come here.

14:35.749 --> 14:38.335
[both grunting, moaning]

14:38.460 --> 14:40.629
-Whatever will the staff think?
-Does it matter?

14:44.466 --> 14:46.468
[muffled grunting, moaning]

14:54.018 --> 14:55.269
[muffled moaning]

14:55.352 --> 14:56.812
[glass shatters]

14:56.896 --> 14:58.188
[moaning continues]

15:24.548 --> 15:25.674
-Ah!
-Ooh.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.884
Apologies, Your Grace.

15:29.511 --> 15:33.724
Well, our activities are quite… spirited.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.562
I admit,
I did not even know it was possible.

15:38.646 --> 15:44.318
I believed his physical inability
to have children would preclude him from…

15:44.401 --> 15:47.071
…causing such difficult entanglements?

15:47.154 --> 15:49.323
[both giggling]

15:49.949 --> 15:50.824
Yes.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.161
I am quite glad to say I was wrong.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.539
[both laugh]

15:58.374 --> 15:59.792
[both sigh]

16:08.300 --> 16:10.469
[Benedict] He took your ribbon?
Did you take the ribbon?

16:10.552 --> 16:13.222
-[Gregory] Dunno what you're talking ab--
-[Hyacinth] I saw him do it.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.849
-[Benedict] I saw it in your pocket.
-[Hyacinth] It's not fair.

16:15.933 --> 16:16.976
He does it every time.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.811
-Just give it back.
-Gregory, stop!

16:18.894 --> 16:19.979
-Good morning.
-Greg--

16:21.814 --> 16:22.815
Morning, brother.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.694
-Colin, your engagement is in Whistledown!
-Hyacinth!

16:27.277 --> 16:28.904
[Hyacinth] What? It is!

16:28.988 --> 16:31.407
-Very well. Everyone out, I think.
-[Violet] Yes.

16:42.710 --> 16:43.711
I did say I was sorry.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.839
I suppose I ought to be relieved
I found out before Lady Whistledown.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.758
Mother, I have been courting
Miss Thompson all season.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.261
Perhaps you were so taken up by Daphne
you failed to see it.

16:52.344 --> 16:56.098
I knew you were flirting with her,
but you flirt with plenty of young ladies.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.225
You always have, never in earnest.

16:58.308 --> 17:01.520
-Until now.
-It is all happening so quickly.

17:03.689 --> 17:07.317
I am not sure I have ever seen you
so solemn and serious.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.737
No one ever takes me seriously,
except Marina.

17:13.198 --> 17:16.869
I was not prepared to let
another of you fly the nest so soon.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.162
Never fear, Mother.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.873
You will still have your hands full.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.376
-Especially with Eloise.
-[chuckles]

17:25.044 --> 17:26.003
Good luck with that one.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.340
[horses neighing]

17:31.133 --> 17:33.761
Do you think
Colin will introduce us to his friends?

17:33.844 --> 17:36.180
-Some of them are quite strapping.
-I am sure he will.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.807
I am sure all of our fortunes
are about to change.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.684
Mm. Especially Colin's.

17:43.645 --> 17:46.648
-You look very lovely today, Penelope.
-Do not mock me.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.408
It pains me you should think
every compliment a mockery.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.410
Do not pity me, either.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.995
I do not pity you, Penelope.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.205
I respect you.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.459
You have been a true friend
since I arrived here,

18:05.542 --> 18:07.878
and I rely on your continued friendship
and sympathy.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.214
My continued silence, you mean?

18:11.423 --> 18:13.801
You think so little of me,
I cannot bear it.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.639
I never would have made my way
through this awful tangle

18:18.722 --> 18:19.765
without your kindness.

18:19.848 --> 18:22.267
Please do not tell me you regret it.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.522
I would never bring scandal
on you or our family,

18:26.605 --> 18:28.023
if that is what you ask,

18:28.107 --> 18:29.817
but I cannot condone your actions.

18:33.153 --> 18:34.988
I want you as my friend, Pen.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.617
Can you not try to understand
and be a little pleased for me?

18:39.409 --> 18:41.286
Marina? Time for the modiste.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.913
We must see to your trousseau.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.923
-[scoffs] She is so lucky.
-[Prudence sighs wistfully]

18:53.006 --> 18:55.384
A whole new wardrobe
and a handsome husband.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.846
Between the two of them,
they will make the most beautiful baby.

18:59.721 --> 19:03.392
He is not the father, you dunderhead!

19:03.475 --> 19:06.353
-[both laughing]
-Oh, my goodness! I clean forgot.

19:06.436 --> 19:09.106
Do not laugh at him!
She makes a fool of him already.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.358
Ugh! You are no fun anymore.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.153
Was I ever?

19:17.531 --> 19:21.952
See? You will look so very lovely
with it pinned up next season.

19:22.035 --> 19:23.996
No. I will look like
every other young lady,

19:24.079 --> 19:25.873
except less graceful
and more bad-tempered.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.127
Lady Bridgerton. Miss Eloise.

19:30.210 --> 19:33.297
I understand we are here
on the matter of dropping our hems?

19:33.380 --> 19:34.298
Precisely.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.510
[Lady Featherington]
Lady Bridgerton! There you are.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.762
Lady Featherington. Miss Thompson.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.931
It is lovely to see you, Lady Bridgerton.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.767
You must call me Violet now, I insist.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.603
Is this not just delightful,

19:47.686 --> 19:51.106
to know now
that our families will be joined forever?

19:51.190 --> 19:53.609
Yes, it certainly is something.
[strained chuckle]

19:53.692 --> 19:58.488
You must join us tomorrow night,
you, and dear Colin, and the viscount.

19:58.572 --> 20:02.409
-We have so much to celebrate.
-I will certainly ask the viscount.

20:02.492 --> 20:06.538
Perfect. Now, I shall need to steal
Madame Delacroix away for a moment.

20:06.622 --> 20:10.626
[chuckles] I do apologize,
Lady Featherington,

20:10.709 --> 20:12.878
but first there is the matter
of your account.

20:12.961 --> 20:15.005
I was clear to your maid
that your line of credit--

20:15.088 --> 20:16.590
Allow me to stop you there.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.303
Our bills will be settled in full

20:21.386 --> 20:23.847
as soon as you have made Miss Thompson,
soon-to-be Bridgerton,

20:23.931 --> 20:26.141
her gown
and the other items for her trousseau.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.310
I am afraid that is not possible.

20:28.852 --> 20:33.065
Perhaps you might find another tailoress
more to your liking across town.

20:33.774 --> 20:36.360
-Oui?
-Madame Delacroix, that reminds me.

20:36.443 --> 20:39.029
You have such a unique accent,

20:39.112 --> 20:41.907
and yet I have never asked
where in France you're from.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.077
[in French]
My mother was French, you see,

20:45.160 --> 20:47.204
and I am not fooled by your little act.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.332
I would hate
for the other ladies of the ton

20:50.415 --> 20:52.125
to learn they have been taken in as well.

20:53.669 --> 20:57.631
[in English] I believe Madame Delacroix
will be somewhat more amenable

20:57.714 --> 21:00.717
to our requests now, Lady Featherington.
Très bon?

21:01.635 --> 21:03.303
-Très bon.
-[Marina] Mm.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.650
[attendees chattering]

21:16.733 --> 21:19.069
[pigs snorting loudly]

21:22.614 --> 21:23.991
What is the prize for the winner?

21:24.074 --> 21:26.368
Why, slaughter, of course.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.621
[Simon chuckles]

21:33.166 --> 21:35.210
-[Simon clears throat]
-[Daphne] Ahem.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.546
As the duke has granted me the honor

21:37.629 --> 21:40.173
of opening our village fair
with this contest,

21:40.257 --> 21:44.636
it is after careful consideration
that I have decided…

21:46.722 --> 21:48.682
that all three pigs have tied!

21:48.765 --> 21:50.392
[confused murmuring]

21:50.976 --> 21:54.730
I hereby decree every pig such a winner
that none should be slaughtered.

21:56.106 --> 21:59.067
[hesitant applause]

22:02.154 --> 22:05.157
[maypole dance music plays]

22:08.452 --> 22:10.037
They look lovely.

22:10.787 --> 22:11.955
Look at those.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.251
Why, these are delicious!
We must order some for Clyvedon.

22:18.962 --> 22:21.923
Does your patronage extend
beyond pies, Your Grace?

22:22.799 --> 22:26.720
The harvests on the farm have been poor,
and with the rents being tripled,

22:26.803 --> 22:28.722
we are struggling
to put food on the table.

22:28.805 --> 22:29.973
The rents tripled?

22:30.057 --> 22:31.516
My steward did not inform me.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.602
He hasn't shown his face
since your father passed,

22:33.685 --> 22:35.812
God rest His Grace's soul.

22:35.896 --> 22:39.191
He always gave his tenants
what they needed, unlike some.

22:39.274 --> 22:42.027
Then it is a good thing indeed
that we are back at Clyvedon.

22:42.110 --> 22:45.405
I am sure we can find a solution
to these difficulties,

22:45.489 --> 22:47.991
and I thank you
for bringing them to our attention.

22:48.075 --> 22:48.909
Your Grace.

22:54.498 --> 22:55.999
[child whining]

22:56.917 --> 22:59.086
-[child screeching, crying]
-Oh!

22:59.169 --> 23:02.255
Oh, there, there, there, child.
No need to cry.

23:02.839 --> 23:03.882
All is well.

23:04.508 --> 23:07.511
My! You have a strong set of lungs.
They shall hear you all the way in London.

23:07.594 --> 23:10.222
-If not all the way to France.
-[Daphne chuckles]

23:11.431 --> 23:12.682
Oh, my goodness.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.351
I must apologize, Your Grace.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.645
Little Ada
has just discovered her own voice

23:16.728 --> 23:19.689
and likes to use it
as often and loudly as she can.

23:20.482 --> 23:21.900
Oh, um…

23:22.609 --> 23:23.985
Oh, please, stand.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.321
You should not be stooping
in your condition.

23:31.451 --> 23:34.246
Well, it was lovely
to make your acquaintance.

23:36.039 --> 23:38.250
Ada. [chuckles]

23:38.333 --> 23:39.209
Oh!

23:39.709 --> 23:40.669
Your Grace.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.256
[Daphne] Mm.

23:48.385 --> 23:52.431
What can we do about the farmer's rent?
There must be something.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.975
I should have returned sooner
to see that things were in order.

23:55.058 --> 23:57.060
I did not realize
my absence would be felt this way.

23:57.144 --> 23:58.520
-Daphne--
-I hope that--

23:59.521 --> 24:00.522
Please.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.566
I only meant to say,

24:03.150 --> 24:07.237
I hope it did not pain you too much
to see me with those children.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.030
Pain me?

24:10.282 --> 24:12.617
Daphne, I thought only of you.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.872
You know, oddly enough,

24:16.955 --> 24:18.832
when I am actually
in the presence of children,

24:18.915 --> 24:20.625
I forget all about my own concerns.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.920
They are the easiest company in the world.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.505
You are natural with them.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.757
My younger sisters and brother.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.260
Each one a mischief.

24:31.970 --> 24:35.724
You know, my abundant family will be good
for at least one thing in future.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.728
Eventually, they will all marry
and have children of their own,

24:39.811 --> 24:44.316
and we will have more screaming infants
in our lives than we know what to do with.

24:44.399 --> 24:46.234
[both laughing]

24:47.527 --> 24:49.696
You will be a splendid aunt.

24:50.405 --> 24:54.034
It thrills me that you are satisfied
with our married life as it is,

24:54.784 --> 24:55.911
just the two of us.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.330
I have all that I want just here.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.749
How did I earn such luck?

25:01.500 --> 25:03.251
That I do not know.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.145
[Lord Featherington sighs]

25:30.695 --> 25:31.905
Turn, please.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.532
Profile.

25:35.116 --> 25:35.951
Swish.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.744
Swish!

25:42.332 --> 25:45.877
Good. You have done well thus far,
Miss Thompson.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.256
Tonight, I shall need to raise
the matter of a swift wedding.

25:49.339 --> 25:50.257
[snickers loudly]

25:52.259 --> 25:53.134
I am…

25:54.010 --> 25:55.136
very sorry.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.973
But this plan of yours, I find it wanting.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.225
Deceiving Colin is one thing,

26:00.308 --> 26:02.811
but being at close quarters
with his mother,

26:02.894 --> 26:03.979
that is quite another.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.397
Lady Bridgerton is shrewd.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.898
She has had eight children.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.568
Trust she knows when she is being managed.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.949
What were your favorite pastimes
in the country?

26:16.032 --> 26:18.577
I enjoyed riding above all else, my lady.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.453
Please,
you must call me Violet now.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.371
Remember?

26:21.454 --> 26:24.666
Miss Thompson
is such a proper young lady, is she not?

26:24.749 --> 26:27.586
Have you traveled at all
beyond England, Miss Thompson?

26:27.669 --> 26:31.047
It has long been Colin's greatest ambition
to travel the world.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.007
Never.

26:32.716 --> 26:35.385
Though it is now
a great ambition of mine as well.

26:35.468 --> 26:38.471
I am sensing a honeymoon in foreign parts.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.558
What think you, Lord Bridgerton?

26:41.641 --> 26:43.143
I would not like to speculate.

26:43.226 --> 26:47.188
Yes, indeed. I believe a honeymoon
in foreign parts would be just the thing.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.482
Mr. Bridgerton,
you might even make the most

26:49.566 --> 26:51.192
of this fine weather we've been having

26:51.276 --> 26:54.696
if you choose to marry
sooner rather than later.

26:55.405 --> 26:56.990
Colin is still very young.

26:57.741 --> 27:00.076
I believe
a lengthier engagement would be prudent,

27:00.160 --> 27:01.578
excellent weather notwithstanding.

27:03.955 --> 27:07.250
Mother, have I told you Miss Thompson
is very accomplished at needlework?

27:07.751 --> 27:09.836
She is quite brilliant.
Puts my sisters to shame.

27:09.919 --> 27:11.588
I can assure you, that is not true.

27:11.671 --> 27:14.215
You have not seen
my sister Daphne's embroidery.

27:14.299 --> 27:18.011
-In all honesty, it is like a battlefield.

Pen, of course.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.851

28:07.769 --> 28:08.603

28:09.604 --> 28:11.022
is a rather delicate matter.

28:11.106 --> 28:14.567
I wish I did not have cause to raise it,
but I believe you deserve to know.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.611
Is there something on my face?

28:16.695 --> 28:18.613
Has it been there all evening?
It has, hasn't it?

28:19.614 --> 28:20.949
Sorry. Um, go on.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.660
I have wanted to talk to you
since the engagement was announced,

28:23.743 --> 28:24.828
but we're always in company.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.413
So, this is something about Marina?

28:26.496 --> 28:28.248
Her heart belongs to another.

28:29.207 --> 28:30.041
What?

28:30.125 --> 28:31.501
His name is Sir George Crane.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.128
He is a first son, a soldier.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.338
They grew up
in neighboring properties in the country.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.882
I am sorry,
but I have seen their love letters.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.385
I felt you should know
before it was too late.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.683
You really are very good. You know that?

28:48.518 --> 28:49.811
Did you think that I would care

28:49.894 --> 28:52.188
that she had fond feelings
for another before we met?

28:52.939 --> 28:55.108
It would be rich of me,
considering I have flirted

28:55.191 --> 28:57.026
with half the girls in London
at one point.

28:57.110 --> 28:59.988
You misunderstand.
This was no mere flirtation.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.990
Marina loves this man.
She loves him still.

29:02.073 --> 29:03.616
And yet she is marrying me.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.285
Trust me, Pen, do not fret.

29:05.785 --> 29:07.579
I know my mind and Marina's.

29:07.662 --> 29:09.330
We understand each other.

29:12.625 --> 29:15.420
Oh. Have we moved the party
to the corridor?

29:15.503 --> 29:16.963
You know, it is peculiar,

29:17.464 --> 29:19.674
but the further I get
from that pianoforte,

29:19.758 --> 29:21.009
the more like a party it feels.

29:21.593 --> 29:24.053
Pen, your mother's asking for you.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.805
[muffled music continues]

29:29.309 --> 29:30.602
[tepid applause]

29:31.478 --> 29:32.687
[Marina sighs deeply]

29:32.771 --> 29:33.772
Is anything wrong?

29:34.439 --> 29:35.565
Is it my brother? He…

29:36.316 --> 29:38.485
He was odious at dinner. I apologize.

29:39.527 --> 29:40.570
I cannot stand it, Colin.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.989
My own father does not want me.

29:43.072 --> 29:45.617
Even the Featheringtons
cannot wait to be rid of me.

29:45.700 --> 29:47.118
Fool that I am, I truly thought

29:47.202 --> 29:49.913
that with your family,
I might finally find acceptance.

29:51.498 --> 29:52.540
But it is no use.

29:53.958 --> 29:57.629
-Even your mother is just being polite.
-That is not true, Marina.

29:58.922 --> 30:00.507
I am your family now.

30:01.424 --> 30:03.927
We shall make our own family, you and me.

30:05.428 --> 30:06.846
It is all I want.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.807
It is all I want in all the world.

30:09.474 --> 30:12.060
I wish we could be married
this very minute.

30:12.977 --> 30:15.021
Then we could be alone together always.

30:16.731 --> 30:18.983
I would never have to leave your arms.

30:21.528 --> 30:24.113
-What if I told you there was a way?
-Colin, what are--

30:24.197 --> 30:26.074
Scotland. Gretna Green.

30:28.034 --> 30:29.410
I know it is mad,

30:29.494 --> 30:32.580
but we could be married
within a matter of days.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.123
We just have to make it to the border.

30:34.207 --> 30:37.085
Anthony would be an ogre about it
when we first return, of course,

30:37.168 --> 30:38.795
but by then, it would be too late.

30:38.878 --> 30:41.214
We would be married. We would be together.

30:44.300 --> 30:45.468
You hate the idea.

30:47.720 --> 30:48.763
I love it.

30:49.514 --> 30:50.723
I love you.

30:51.975 --> 30:54.561
Allow me a day.
I shall arrange everything.

30:55.144 --> 30:56.312
[sighs happily]

31:03.903 --> 31:05.113
[sighs lightly]

31:42.692 --> 31:46.362
-Ah. Here you are.
-Oh, good morning, dearest.

31:48.698 --> 31:52.201
-The steward's books, I take it?
-Mm. I could not sleep.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.913
Not even after last night's exertions?

31:54.996 --> 31:55.997
[chuckles]

31:56.748 --> 31:59.208
Would you care to break your fast with me?

31:59.292 --> 32:01.544
I am sorry, my love.
The farmer in the village was right.

32:01.628 --> 32:03.379
The estates have been neglected
far too long.

32:03.463 --> 32:05.673
Wheat yields are down,
yet nobody uses the fields

32:05.757 --> 32:08.509
for livestock grazing,
or rotate to a more plentiful crop.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.387
-Is that not the steward's job?
-[angrily] They're my tenants, my people.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.097
The responsibility is mine.

32:15.683 --> 32:18.728
Please, excuse me. I have been staring
at these figures all morning.

32:19.437 --> 32:20.313
Of course.

32:22.398 --> 32:25.610
I suppose I have a good deal
to occupy myself with today too.

32:25.693 --> 32:26.819
[Simon] Mm.

32:26.903 --> 32:29.280
You know,
I mean to visit some of your tenants.

32:30.406 --> 32:32.951
I might deliver some gift baskets and…

32:43.169 --> 32:44.796
Are you missing home, Your Grace?

32:48.299 --> 32:50.760
Do you think we have enough
for all the baskets?

32:51.511 --> 32:52.971
Um, I should think so.

32:53.054 --> 32:54.430
Your Grace!

32:54.973 --> 32:56.057
Whatever are you…

32:57.183 --> 32:59.185
I will have someone
gather those on your behalf.

32:59.268 --> 33:01.354
One of the kitchen maids or the gardener.

33:01.437 --> 33:03.147
Was no one available to assist you?

33:03.231 --> 33:05.608
There is no need
to trouble anyone, Mrs. Colson.

33:05.692 --> 33:06.859
We have it all in hand.

33:06.943 --> 33:10.113
Do you intend to collect honey
from the hives in person as well?

33:10.947 --> 33:12.198
[chuckles] Oh…

33:12.281 --> 33:14.409
That might be a little beyond me.

33:16.744 --> 33:19.080
If you simply tell me
of your wants and needs,

33:19.163 --> 33:21.541
I will ensure everything is in order.

33:21.624 --> 33:24.127
I will ensure everything is done properly.

33:25.420 --> 33:28.006
-I shall keep that in mind.
-Mm.

33:28.673 --> 33:29.841
Thank you, Mrs. Colson.

33:29.924 --> 33:31.009
Mm-hmm.

33:37.598 --> 33:40.351
Faith, she despises me.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.145
She despises everybody.

33:42.228 --> 33:44.022
Do not give it another thought.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.857
[villagers chattering, laughing]

33:47.567 --> 33:48.484
[Daphne] Hello.

33:48.568 --> 33:49.986
Would you like a basket?

33:50.862 --> 33:52.697
-There is--
-[villager clears throat]

33:53.197 --> 33:54.657
A basket from Clyvedon?

33:55.700 --> 33:57.326
Oh! A basket from Clyvedon?

33:57.410 --> 33:59.579
-There is--
-[villagers whisper, indistinct]

34:02.165 --> 34:03.499
Is something amiss?

34:04.083 --> 34:07.545
Mama taught me it was tradition
for the new duchess to visit with gifts.

34:07.628 --> 34:09.464
Well, I believe it is proper.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.258
Should I have worn a different dress?

34:12.341 --> 34:15.178
Or perhaps it signifies
I am high in the instep.

34:15.261 --> 34:16.554
[Ada] Your Grace!

34:17.221 --> 34:18.473
[Ada laughs]

34:20.224 --> 34:24.228
Would you like a basket from Clyvedon?
There is bread and honey for the children.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.688
Oh. You are too kind.

34:26.397 --> 34:29.525
I would gladly take one
if I had means to carry it home.

34:29.609 --> 34:31.402
Then we are determined to walk with you.

34:31.486 --> 34:32.862
Oh, no. I didn't--

34:32.945 --> 34:34.655
-I insist.
-No. Oh, I…

34:35.448 --> 34:36.491
[sighs]

34:37.241 --> 34:40.244
Perhaps I might ask
your opinion on something?

34:40.328 --> 34:41.162
Of course.

34:41.245 --> 34:44.707
Though, how I might
advise a duchess, I am not sure.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.836
I feel that I have done something
to offend the village.

34:49.879 --> 34:51.339
I know I am new to the role,

34:51.422 --> 34:54.300
but I cannot imagine
what I have done wrong so soon.

34:57.011 --> 34:59.055
-What?
-It was the pigs.

35:00.681 --> 35:02.975
You said that all three pigs won.

35:03.059 --> 35:04.060
At the fair?

35:05.186 --> 35:07.105
I thought it the best outcome
for everyone.

35:07.188 --> 35:09.315
It is tradition that the winner is allowed

35:09.398 --> 35:11.734
to supply pork to Clyvedon
for the next year.

35:11.818 --> 35:15.154
It's a great number of pigs, indeed.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.698
When you could not choose a winner,

35:17.782 --> 35:19.659
no farmer won the contract,

35:19.742 --> 35:21.577
nor the income to go along with it.

35:21.661 --> 35:24.330
-[Daphne gasps]
-Simply speaking, you, um…

35:24.413 --> 35:25.748
You snubbed them.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.875
I will correct my mistake at once. I…

35:28.793 --> 35:30.169
I had no idea.

35:30.253 --> 35:32.463
[sighs] How could you have, Your Grace?

35:45.518 --> 35:46.602
What is all this?

35:47.270 --> 35:48.271
Simon?

35:48.354 --> 35:49.230
[man] Steady…

35:49.313 --> 35:51.315
-Is everything well?
-Ah, Daphne. Yes.

35:51.399 --> 35:52.859
I'm setting up work in the east wing.

35:52.942 --> 35:54.569
-What's wrong with the study?
-[loud crash]

35:54.652 --> 35:55.528
Careful!

35:55.611 --> 35:57.196
You shall have to excuse me.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.118
Your Grace.

36:03.619 --> 36:04.579
Mrs. Colson?

36:05.246 --> 36:06.539
Do you have a moment?

36:07.248 --> 36:08.457
[Colson grunts lightly]

36:08.541 --> 36:11.460
I know I have made some missteps
since I arrived.

36:12.545 --> 36:15.464
My mother taught me a great deal
about being mistress of a household,

36:15.548 --> 36:17.925
but I am not sure
either of us ever imagined

36:18.009 --> 36:19.719
a house as grand as this one.

36:19.802 --> 36:20.761
[Colson] Mm-hmm.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.848
I am so very grateful for your guidance,
Mrs. Colson.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.019
The truth is…

36:29.478 --> 36:33.024
I fear the duke might not
be entirely at ease here at Clyvedon,

36:33.107 --> 36:35.943
which is of course no reflection
of you or any of your staff.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.238
-No. I-- I quite understand.
-You do?

36:39.322 --> 36:40.448
Master Simon--

36:40.531 --> 36:42.742
Eh… I beg your pardon. His Grace…

36:43.326 --> 36:45.578
His childhood was not always easy.

36:46.537 --> 36:48.372
After the death of my late mistress,

36:48.456 --> 36:50.625
the duke lived almost exclusively
in London.

36:50.708 --> 36:53.044
Do you mean to say
that Simon grew up here on his own?

36:53.127 --> 36:54.670
We did our best to take care of him,

36:54.754 --> 36:56.505
to mind him
as his mother would have wanted.

36:56.589 --> 36:57.673
Of course you did.

36:57.757 --> 36:58.591
[Colson] Mm.

37:00.092 --> 37:02.970
The late duke
must have loved his wife very much

37:03.054 --> 37:05.348
to have struggled so after her death.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.809
Was it not a happy marriage, then?

37:09.602 --> 37:11.270
It was strained.

37:12.521 --> 37:13.773
He wanted an heir.

37:13.856 --> 37:15.149
She wanted a child.

37:16.317 --> 37:19.779
She kept trying
long after the doctors warned her not to.

37:19.862 --> 37:23.282
Every month when her courses came,
it broke my heart to see her.

37:24.825 --> 37:26.410
She was lucky to have you.

37:26.494 --> 37:28.454
Everyone talked
as though it was her fault.

37:28.537 --> 37:31.958
But how could they know that?
It is not always the woman who is barren.

37:32.041 --> 37:34.460
Sometimes
it is the man's fault, of course.

37:35.211 --> 37:37.922
Oh dear.
I am afraid I am speaking out of turn.

37:38.005 --> 37:40.299
No. Not at all, Mrs. Colson.

37:41.092 --> 37:41.968
Mm.

37:42.969 --> 37:43.970
You were saying?

37:44.929 --> 37:48.557
Well, I said to the duchess
what my mother said to me.

37:49.225 --> 37:52.770
A womb cannot quicken
without strong, healthy seed.

37:52.853 --> 37:56.732
And then, just as she was finally blessed
with Master Simon…

37:57.358 --> 37:58.734
[sobbing] we lost her.

38:02.697 --> 38:03.614
[knocking at door]

38:06.492 --> 38:07.743
Why are you not dressed?

38:07.827 --> 38:10.538
I told you we were dining
with Lady Gartside this evening.

38:10.621 --> 38:12.748
[coughing, gasping]

38:12.832 --> 38:14.667
Sorry, Mama. I'm not feeling well.

38:15.376 --> 38:18.587
I ought to make you come along
to cough and splutter all evening.

38:18.671 --> 38:20.631
It would serve Lady Gartside right.

38:20.715 --> 38:24.552
She has been withholding
a dinner invitation from me, and now look…

38:25.094 --> 38:27.305
Not a day
after Miss Thompson's announcement,

38:27.388 --> 38:29.307
and they all come crawling.

38:29.390 --> 38:30.891
[coughing]

38:31.434 --> 38:33.019
Enjoy your evening, Mama!

38:33.102 --> 38:34.770
[footsteps receding]

38:35.980 --> 38:37.023
[sighs lightly]

38:38.649 --> 38:39.608
[sighs]

38:40.860 --> 38:42.653
[breathes deeply]

38:42.737 --> 38:44.864
[suspenseful music plays]

38:56.208 --> 38:57.877
[suspenseful music continues]

39:36.415 --> 39:38.459
[suspenseful music intensifies]

40:03.526 --> 40:05.194
[suspenseful music ends]

40:08.864 --> 40:10.408
Penelope, what are you…?

40:12.660 --> 40:13.869
-How dare you!
-Look.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.163
Look at the signature
on Sir George's last letter,

40:16.247 --> 40:18.457
and this one from many months ago.

40:20.918 --> 40:23.254
-So?
-So, they are not the same.

40:23.337 --> 40:25.172
The slant of the lettering,
it is all wrong.

40:25.756 --> 40:28.008
-Penelope, I'm tired. I haven't--
-This one.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.846

still not replied to my letters.

He sees me as a wife, a woman.

And as a woman,
I must make these difficult choices
