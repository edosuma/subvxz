00:00.434 --> 00:04.236
<i> PREVIOUSLY ON</i>
PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:04.238 --> 00:06.005
( gasps )

00:06.007 --> 00:09.441
I WANT TO FINISH WHAT I STARTED
TO TELL YOU AT HOMECOMING.

00:09.443 --> 00:10.976
IS THAT IAN?

00:10.978 --> 00:12.311
DOES MELISSA KNOW HE'S BACK?

00:12.313 --> 00:13.479
I DON'T KNOW WHY
SHE EVER BROKE UP WITH HIM.

00:13.481 --> 00:16.081
SHE DIDN'T.
HE BROKE UP WITH HER.

00:16.083 --> 00:19.118
HANNA, WE HAVE TO MAKE
SOME ADJUSTMENTS.
THIS IS A ONE-PAYCHECK FAMILY.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.487
WE CAN NO LONGER LIVE
A TWO-PAYCHECK LIFE.

00:21.489 --> 00:22.521
THIS IS NOEL KAHN.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.056
HE WAS YOUR BIGGEST CRUSH

00:24.058 --> 00:26.158
ALL THROUGH MIDDLE SCHOOL,
AND NOW HE'S ASKED YOU OUT.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.963
DAD, THIS IS MY FRIEND MAYA.

00:30.965 --> 00:32.131
VERY HAPPY TO MEET YOU.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.599
( siren wailing )

00:33.601 --> 00:34.700
( indistinct
radio transmission )

00:37.304 --> 00:39.004
"ALISON LOVES IAN"?

00:40.941 --> 00:42.207
I WAS WRONG.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.748
( beeps )

00:51.619 --> 00:52.618
HANNA!

00:58.959 --> 01:02.161
THERE'S BEEN AN ACCIDENT!
PLEASE HURRY!

01:02.163 --> 01:04.830
"SHE KNEW TOO MUCH. A."

01:04.832 --> 01:07.499
SOMEBODY! HELP!

01:17.311 --> 01:20.345
Man on radio:<i> ¶ IF YOU GO DOWN</i>
<i> IN THE WOODS TODAY ¶</i>

01:20.347 --> 01:22.881

01:47.675 --> 01:48.907
( indistinct

01:54.715 --> 01:55.747
MISS MARIN.

01:55.749 --> 01:59.017
OH, HELLO, BARRY.

01:59.019 --> 01:59.985
SOMETHING WRONG?

01:59.987 --> 02:01.353
I'M AFRAID SO.

02:01.355 --> 02:03.188
IT JUST CAME OVER THE RADIO.

02:03.190 --> 02:05.991
I'M SORRY, BUT YOUR DAUGHTER'S
BEEN INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.442
IS THAT HANNA?

02:23.444 --> 02:25.110
( siren wailing )

02:29.783 --> 02:33.452
WE HAVE TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL.
ARE YOU GUYS OKAY TO DRIVE?

02:33.454 --> 02:35.254
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.088
OKAY.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.108
¶ GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT? ¶

02:56.110 --> 02:58.610

03:15.229 --> 03:17.930
HANNA'S MOM IS WITH THE DOCTOR.

03:17.932 --> 03:19.765
I'M OKAY.

03:19.767 --> 03:22.100
I DON'T KNOW WHO
WAS DRIVING THE CAR.

03:22.102 --> 03:25.103
WE WERE AT MONA'S PARTY,
AND HANNA GOT A TEXT.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.039
SO WE WERE GOING
TO THE PARKING LOT TO MEET HER,

03:27.041 --> 03:29.508
AND THAT'S WHEN SHE GOT HIT.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.509
SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUS.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.977
WE COULDN'T TALK TO HER.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.645
THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO WAIT--

03:33.647 --> 03:35.948
MAYBE THEY'LL LET US SEE HER
OR SOMETHING.

03:35.950 --> 03:38.750
UM, LET ME CALL YOU BACK
WHEN I KNOW SOMETHING.

03:38.752 --> 03:39.651
BYE, ALEX.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.489
IS SHE OKAY, MRS. MARIN?

03:44.491 --> 03:47.359
SHE IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.228
SHE, UH...

03:49.230 --> 03:53.665
SHE HAS A BROKEN LEG
AND A BROKEN ANKLE,
BRUISED RIBS,

03:53.667 --> 03:56.501
AND THEY MIGHT HAVE
TO REMOVE HER SPLEEN.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.206
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:03.811 --> 04:06.011
HANNA WAS COMING ACROSS
THE PARKING LOT,

04:06.013 --> 04:09.881
AND THIS CAR
JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.450
WELL, THE POLICE FOUND THE CAR.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.185
THEY SAID IT WAS STOLEN
FROM A CAMPGROUND LOT.

04:13.187 --> 04:14.319
DID THEY CATCH THE DRIVER?

04:14.321 --> 04:15.988
NO, NOT YET.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.990
WELL, THE COPS SHOULD BE
LOOKING FOR TOBY CAVANAUGH.

04:17.992 --> 04:20.759
IT WASN'T TOBY CAVANAUGH.
THE POLICE PICKED HIM UP
LAST NIGHT.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.561
WHAT?

04:22.563 --> 04:24.730
ONE OF THE OFFICERS TOLD ME
THEY FOUND HIM HIDING IN TOWN,

04:24.732 --> 04:26.698
AND THEY WERE BRINGING HIM IN
TO THE STATION

04:26.700 --> 04:28.066
WHEN THEY GOT THE CALL
ABOUT HANNA.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.471
( sighs )

04:32.473 --> 04:34.172
YOU GIRLS SHOULD GO HOME.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.108
I WILL CALL YOU WHEN
HANNA CAN HAVE VISITORS.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.711
JUST LET HANNA KNOW
THAT WE WERE HERE.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.480
I WILL...
WHEN SHE WAKES UP.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.054
TOBY ISN'T "A."

04:49.056 --> 04:50.722
WELL, HANNA KNOWS WHO IS.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.791
THAT'S WHY
"A" TRIED TO KILL HER.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.760
YOU THINK THEY'RE
JUST TRYING TO SCARE US?

04:54.762 --> 04:56.728
WELL, IT WORKED.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.397
THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT SCARING US,

04:58.399 --> 04:59.898
THAT WAS JUST A BONUS.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.667
THIS STARTED WITH MURDER--

05:01.669 --> 05:04.403
WE WERE CRAZY TO THINK THAT
IT WOULDN'T END UP LIKE THIS.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.205
SO SHOULD WE TELL THE COPS?
TELL THEM WHAT?

05:07.207 --> 05:08.740
EVERYTHING.
WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.242
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

05:10.244 --> 05:12.678
WELL, WE TALK TO HANNA
BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING.

05:14.248 --> 05:15.647
IS HANNA SAFE HERE?

05:18.452 --> 05:20.485
YEAH.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.721
I MEAN,
NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO HER
WHILE HER MOM IS WITH HER.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.271
MOM SAID YOU CALLED.

05:39.273 --> 05:40.639
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

05:40.641 --> 05:43.608
YEAH. YEAH, I'M OKAY.

05:43.610 --> 05:44.776
WHAT HAPPENED?

05:47.815 --> 05:50.082
( crying )

05:50.084 --> 05:52.617
A CAR HIT HANNA.

05:52.619 --> 05:53.952
A CAR?

05:53.954 --> 05:55.420
WHO WAS DRIVING?

05:55.422 --> 05:57.122
WE DON'T KNOW.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.390
THEY DIDN'T STOP?

05:58.392 --> 05:59.691
NO, THEY JUST--

05:59.693 --> 06:02.227
THEY JUST KNOCKED HER DOWN
AND DROVE AWAY.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.695
OH, GOD.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.130
Ian: IS SHE OKAY?

06:05.132 --> 06:07.733
SHE'S JUST SHAKEN UP.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.534
NO, I MEAN HANNA.

06:09.536 --> 06:14.272
YEAH. YEAH, HER MOM SAID
SHE WAS GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

06:14.274 --> 06:15.374
GOOD.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.644
HEAD'S UP, SPENCE,
I'M CANCELING MONDAY'S PRACTICE.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.449
I'LL BE OUT
IN A MINUTE, IAN.

06:24.451 --> 06:25.283
OKAY.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.157
HE STAYED THE NIGHT?

06:32.159 --> 06:34.659
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE STRANGERS.

06:34.661 --> 06:38.130
WE WENT OUT FOR TWO YEARS,
AND WE HAD A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

06:38.132 --> 06:40.832
GO UPSTAIRS.
GET SOME SLEEP, OKAY?

06:43.203 --> 06:44.336
OKAY.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.669
WHEN THEY FIND THE MANIAC
WHO DID THIS TO YOU,

07:17.671 --> 07:20.005
I WILL KILL HIM.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.941
AFTER I KILL HIM,
I WILL SUE HIM.

07:22.943 --> 07:27.345
HAVE YOU SEEN ARIA
OR SPENCER OR EMILY?

07:27.347 --> 07:28.980
YEAH, THERE WERE ALL HERE.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.048
I SENT THEM HOME.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.084
SEAN WAS HERE, TOO,

07:33.086 --> 07:36.755
AND A BOY NAMED LUCAS.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.691
WHO IS HE EXACTLY?

07:39.693 --> 07:41.726
HE WORKS ON THE YEARBOOK
WITH ME.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.500
I NEED TO CALL SPENCER.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.669
THEY HAVE TO COME BACK.
THAT CAN WAIT.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.171
NO. NO, MOM, IT CAN'T.

07:53.173 --> 07:56.241
I WILL CALL THEM.
YOU RELAX.

08:00.380 --> 08:03.215
Ezra: I DIDN'T SEE IT
TILL I CAME DOWN THIS MORNING.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.890
MAYBE SOMEBODY PUT IT THERE
AFTER YOU PARKED.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.559
ARIA, WE BOTH KNOW
WHEN THIS HAPPENED.

08:14.561 --> 08:16.061
THIS HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.263
I DON'T KNOW THAT,
AND NEITHER DO YOU.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.931
"I SEE YOU."

08:19.933 --> 08:22.601
NOT "WASH ME."
NOT "GO SHARKS."

08:22.603 --> 08:25.303
"I SEE YOU."
THAT'S VERY SPECIFIC.

08:25.305 --> 08:28.240
MAYBE IT'S SPECIFIC,
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

08:28.242 --> 08:30.809
ARIA, IT MEANS SOMEBODY
SAW US LAST NIGHT.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.782
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.824
HERE YOU GO.

08:45.826 --> 08:46.925
THANK YOU.
MM-HMM.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.797
I REALLY DON'T WANT ANYTHING.

08:52.799 --> 08:55.600
YOU NEED TO EAT
SOME BREAKFAST.

08:55.602 --> 08:58.937
I DON'T WANT YOU
DRIVING BACK TO THE HOSPITAL
IF YOU'RE STRESSED OUT.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.406
GIVE BEN A CALL,
SEE IF HE'LL GIVE YOU A LIFT.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.708
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.444
BEN AND I
ARE SORT OF REALLY OVER.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.246
EVERYONE IN THIS TOWN
FEELS A LOT SAFER

09:08.248 --> 09:09.381
WITH TOBY CAVANAUGH
LOCKED UP.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.718
WHAT HAPPENED TO INNOCENT
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY?

09:13.720 --> 09:16.121
GUILTY OR NOT,
HE'S BETTER WITH THE POLICE

09:16.123 --> 09:17.689
THAN WANDERING AROUND
ON HIS OWN.

09:17.691 --> 09:20.158
THERE'S ALWAYS MORE TO A STORY
THAN PEOPLE THINK.

09:21.828 --> 09:24.129
( phone rings )

09:24.131 --> 09:25.797
NOT AT THE TABLE.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.499
IT MIGHT BE ABOUT HANNA.

09:27.501 --> 09:28.833
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.641
Emily: DOES IT HURT?

09:36.643 --> 09:39.144
YEAH, KIND OF.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.513
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED?

09:43.483 --> 09:46.251
UH, YEAH, I REMEMBER.

09:49.723 --> 09:53.792
UM, MOM, YOU'VE BEEN HERE
THE WHOLE TIME, TOO.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.461
YOU WANNA TAKE A BREAK?

09:58.599 --> 10:00.131
ARE YOU SURE?

10:00.133 --> 10:01.633
YEAH.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.535
I'LL BE BACK
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

10:18.485 --> 10:21.353
NOEL KAHN IS "A."

10:24.725 --> 10:27.359
Spencer: WHAT? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

10:27.361 --> 10:31.896
YEAH, I SAW HIM IN THE WOODS,
AND HE LEFT AN "A" MESSAGE.

10:31.898 --> 10:33.999
Spencer:
YOU SAW HIM LEAVE A MESSAGE?

10:34.001 --> 10:37.202
HE WROTE SOMETHING
ON THE BACK OF A CAR WINDOW.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.336
WHAT CAR?
WHAT DID HE WRITE?

10:40.040 --> 10:41.806
"I SEE YOU."

10:41.808 --> 10:43.742
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

10:43.744 --> 10:46.211
I WAS IN THE CAR.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.946
WHOSE CAR WAS IT?

10:50.851 --> 10:52.117
( Aria sighs )

10:54.187 --> 10:55.720
EZRA FITZ.

10:55.722 --> 10:56.788
MR. FITZ?

10:59.893 --> 11:01.026
ARIA.

11:01.028 --> 11:01.893
HANNA?

11:03.296 --> 11:05.230
IT WAS MR. FITZ.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.265
YOU AND MR. FITZ?

11:09.202 --> 11:10.368
YOU MET HIM THERE?

11:11.872 --> 11:15.373
THE CALL YOU GOT AT THE PARTY--
THAT WAS FROM HIM?

11:15.375 --> 11:16.374
I COULDN'T TELL.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.776
I COULDN'T TELL ANYONE.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.044
I PROMISED EZRA.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.880
EZRA? WHOA, HOLD IT.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.915
THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON?

11:23.917 --> 11:25.650
YOU AND A TEACHER?

11:25.652 --> 11:27.852
I DIDN'T JUST GET INTO HIS CAR
LAST NIGHT.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.354
WHO DO YOU THINK I AM?

11:29.356 --> 11:30.989
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING HIM?

11:30.991 --> 11:33.091
UM...

11:33.093 --> 11:36.327
SINCE RIGHT BEFORE
SCHOOL STARTED.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.930
OH, MY GOD,
SINCE LABOR DAY?!

11:38.932 --> 11:41.332
OKAY, SO YOU DON'T HAVE
A BOYFRIEND IN ICELAND?

11:41.334 --> 11:43.601
NO, I DID.

11:43.603 --> 11:46.738
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.441
YOU WERE SEEING A TEACHER
WHEN I FIXED YOU UP WITH NOEL?

11:54.881 --> 11:57.615
OH, MY GOD,
I FIXED YOU UP WITH NOEL.

11:57.617 --> 12:00.151
AND WHY DID YOU
GET IN HIS CAR LAST NIGHT?

12:02.055 --> 12:04.689
WELL, HE, UM, CALLED ME AND--

12:06.460 --> 12:08.193
OH, DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.364
( sighs ) MY HEAD HURTS
JUST AS MUCH AS MY LEG NOW.

12:13.366 --> 12:17.669
WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU SEE?

12:17.671 --> 12:20.705
WELL, I SAW ARIA
GO INTO A PARKED CAR,

12:20.707 --> 12:24.042
AND THEN I SAW SOMEONE
IN A BLACK HOODIE

12:24.044 --> 12:26.811
WRITE SOMETHING
ON THE BACK OF THE CAR WINDOW,

12:26.813 --> 12:29.347
AND WHEN HE TURNED AROUND,

12:29.349 --> 12:30.849
IT WAS NOEL.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.819
NO, IT CAN'T BE NOEL.

12:34.821 --> 12:37.021
ARIA, I SAW WHAT I SAW.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.656
AND "A" TRIED TO KILL HER
FOR IT.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.960
OKAY, BUT NONE OF US
SAW WHO WAS DRIVING THE CAR.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.628
( knock at door )

12:43.630 --> 12:45.864
( sighs ) IF THAT'S SOMEONE
WITH PAINKILLERS,

12:45.866 --> 12:47.599
JUST LET THEM IN.

12:50.403 --> 12:51.269
NOEL.

12:54.808 --> 12:57.542
I JUST HEARD ABOUT HANNA.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.144
THOUGHT I'D TRY TO VISIT.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.646
SHE JUST FELL ASLEEP.

13:01.648 --> 13:03.148
WE'RE GETTING READY TO LEAVE.

13:12.526 --> 13:14.159
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:14.161 --> 13:16.127
DON'T YOU KNOW?

13:16.129 --> 13:17.896
I HEARD IT WAS A HIT-AND-RUN.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.398
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

13:20.400 --> 13:21.866
SEAN.

13:21.868 --> 13:24.769
IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

13:24.771 --> 13:26.204
YEAH, WE HOPE SO.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.339
THIS IS INSANE.

13:28.341 --> 13:33.845
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.581
WELL,
I'LL TAKE THIS IN FOR YOU.

13:42.556 --> 13:44.289
WE NEED TO TALK.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.324
I KNOW.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.559
YOU'LL CALL ME?

13:47.561 --> 13:48.726
SURE, YEAH.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.231
NOEL.

13:54.734 --> 13:55.934
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?

13:57.237 --> 13:58.536
HANGING WITH SEAN. WHY?

14:00.173 --> 14:01.806
UM, NO, I WAS JUST WONDERING.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.223
HE LIED TO ME...

14:18.225 --> 14:19.891
ABOUT BEING THERE.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.492
HE SAID HE WAS WITH SEAN.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.136
THIS HOUSE
ISN'T GONNA CLEAN ITSELF.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.138
THIS HOUSE
LOOKS FINE TO ME.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.274
THE WATER HEATER'S
ON ITS LAST LEG.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.509
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.744
I'M SORRY.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.748
ABOUT WHAT?

14:43.750 --> 14:47.151
YOU COME HOME, AND ALL I DO
IS RATTLE OFF A LIST OF THINGS
THAT ARE BROKEN.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.820
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

14:48.822 --> 14:50.622
IT MAKES ME FEEL NEEDED.

14:50.624 --> 14:53.424
OH, YOU'RE NEEDED.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.158
HOW LONG?

14:57.397 --> 14:59.430
NOT SURE.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.833
THEY WANT ME TO SUPERVISE
SOME TRAINING EXERCISES,

15:01.835 --> 15:03.801
BUT THEY HAVEN'T SET
A SCHEDULE YET.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.603
WHERE DO YOU HAVE TO GO?

15:05.605 --> 15:08.006
TEXAS.

15:08.008 --> 15:11.009
IT'S ONLY ONE TIME ZONE AWAY.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.478
IT'S JUST SO MUCH BETTER
WHEN YOU'RE HERE,

15:13.480 --> 15:16.648
FOR ME AND EMILY.

15:16.650 --> 15:19.183
IT'S JUST BETTER FOR HER
WITH THE WHOLE TEAM, YOU KNOW?

15:19.185 --> 15:21.386
I KNOW.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.488
YOU'RE DOING GREAT, THOUGH.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.924
HONEY,
SO MUCH AS HAPPENED TO HER.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.325
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:27.327 --> 15:28.593
THIS BUSINESS
ABOUT THE CAVANAUGH KID?

15:28.595 --> 15:32.330
WELL, YEAH, THAT, AND ALISON.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.832
SHE'S JUST REALLY CONFUSED
RIGHT NOW.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.001
CONFUSED HOW?

15:37.003 --> 15:40.004
OH, HONEY, DAUGHTERS
DON'T TALK TO THEIR MOTHERS

15:40.006 --> 15:42.173
THE WAY THEY TALK
TO THEIR DADS.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.876
YOU NEED HER TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING, YOU ASK HER.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.344
SHE'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.284
I GOTTA FINISH.

16:38.164 --> 16:41.199
( sighs ) OH, MY GOD, MONA.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.201
I'M WAVING A WHITE LA PERLA.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.236
THAT'S LIKE
THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE SYMBOL.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.341
CAN I COME IN?

16:50.343 --> 16:51.776
YEAH.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.411
COME IN.

16:53.413 --> 16:56.748
OH, THAT CAST! THAT'S--

16:56.750 --> 16:59.917
THAT'S LIKE FOR A BROKEN LEG.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.253
THAT WON'T KEEP YOU
FROM WEARING HEELS, WILL IT?

17:02.255 --> 17:04.088
JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT.

17:04.090 --> 17:05.123
AW.

17:07.460 --> 17:10.828
IF I HADN'T
UNINVITED YOU TO MY PARTY,

17:10.830 --> 17:13.164
THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE FELT
SO DESPERATE THAT YOU HAD

17:13.166 --> 17:17.201
TO SNEAK AROUND THE EDGES
AND GET HIT BY THAT CAR.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.536
( sighs )

17:18.538 --> 17:20.038
I ALMOST FEEL GUILTY.

17:21.941 --> 17:24.809
MONA, YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO FEEL GUILTY FOR.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.677
OH, GOOD.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.614
CAN WE GO BACK TO BEING FRIENDS?

17:31.584 --> 17:34.352
THE PAST IS FORGOTTEN.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.553
FRIENDS FOREVER.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.459
WHAT?

17:41.461 --> 17:45.997
YOU JUST LOOK SORT OF...
VAGUE.

17:45.999 --> 17:49.634
OH, UM, I DON'T HAVE
ANY MAKEUP ON.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.637
I CAN FIX THAT.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.406
¶ I LIKE WHAT YOU SAY ¶

17:55.408 --> 17:58.543
¶ AND WHAT YOU DO ¶

17:58.545 --> 18:00.912
OH, I'M GLAD
WE'RE FRIENDS AGAIN.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.247
I PROMISE NEVER TO LISTEN
TO ANOTHER RUMOR

18:03.249 --> 18:04.449
UNLESS I START IT MYSELF.

18:08.154 --> 18:11.556
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME
YOU THREW UP ON THE TRAMPOLINE?

18:11.558 --> 18:13.558
YOU DID THAT BACK-FLIP,
AND YOU BARFED AS YOU WENT OVER.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.359
TRUST ME, I REMEMBER.

18:15.361 --> 18:19.163
WELL, THE THING I REMEMBER
WAS YOUR DISMOUNT.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.799
YOU KNEW EVERYBODY
WAS STARING AT YOU.

18:21.801 --> 18:25.236
YOU GOT TO THE EDGE,
CLIMBED DOWN, AND LOOKED AT US.

18:25.238 --> 18:29.307
YOU WIPED YOUR MOUTH,
AND THEN YOU TOOK A BOW.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.476
I WAS IN AWE.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.778
OF ME HURLING
ON THE TRAMPOLINE?

18:33.780 --> 18:35.780
NO, OF THAT BOW.

18:35.782 --> 18:40.151
I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE
THIS INCREDIBLE LIFE LESSON.

18:40.153 --> 18:43.521
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW
I WANTED TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

18:43.523 --> 18:46.691
WOW, I NEVER KNEW THAT.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.326
BECAUSE I NEVER TOLD YOU.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.898
AH, CONCEALER--
THE TRUE MIRACLE DRUG.

18:57.036 --> 19:00.071
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAW ON THAT TREE?

19:00.073 --> 19:01.305
WE BOTH SAW IT, ARIA.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.208
WELL, I KNOW, BUT...

19:04.210 --> 19:07.211
DO YOU THINK THAT MAYBE
ALI JUST PUT IT UP THERE

19:07.213 --> 19:09.247
TO SEE WHAT IT
MIGHT LOOK LIKE?

19:09.249 --> 19:11.415
NO, ALI MAY HAVE DONE
SOME PSYCHO THINGS,

19:11.417 --> 19:13.251
BUT SHE WOULD
NEVER DO ANYTHING TACKY.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.920
ANYWAY,
IAN WAS WITH MELISSA LAST NIGHT,

19:15.922 --> 19:18.723
SO HE COULDN'T BE "A,"

19:18.725 --> 19:21.359
WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO NOEL.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.661
HE HAD MEANS.
HE HAD OPPORTUNITY.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.497
THOSE PICTURES OF EMILY AND MAYA
WERE STOLEN AT NOEL'S PARTY,
RIGHT?

19:26.499 --> 19:28.399
YEAH, I KNOW.

19:28.401 --> 19:31.269
AND HANNA SAW HIM WRITE
THAT MESSAGE ON THE BACK
OF MR. FITZ'S CAR.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.771
NO, JUST SLOW DOWN.

19:33.773 --> 19:37.575
YOU FLIPPED OVER TO NOEL
AWFUL FAST.

19:37.577 --> 19:40.244
JUST 12 HOURS AGO,
YOU WERE SO SURE
THAT IT WAS TOBY.

19:40.246 --> 19:41.712
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT THEORY?

19:41.714 --> 19:45.983
"A" OR NOT, YOU STILL NEED
TO KNOW WHAT NOEL SAW...

19:45.985 --> 19:47.952
AND WHAT HE PLANS
TO DO ABOUT IT.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.224
I'M SORRY, VISITING HOURS
WERE OVER TWO HOURS AGO.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.659
YOU CAN COME IN THE MORNING.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.386
( machine beeping )

21:06.866 --> 21:08.399
HEY.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.101
YOU ALL RIGHT?

21:10.103 --> 21:15.072
YEAH. THEY ADJUSTED MY MEDS.
I'M JUST GETTING USED TO THEM.

21:15.074 --> 21:18.376
WHO SENT THE ORCHIDS?

21:18.378 --> 21:20.311
SEAN BROUGHT THEM THIS MORNING.

21:20.313 --> 21:23.347
VERY NICE.

21:23.349 --> 21:26.784
MOM, I DON'T HAVE TO BE
IN A PRIVATE ROOM.

21:26.786 --> 21:30.688
I CAN MOVE.
WE CAN SAVE A COUPLE BUCKS.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.324
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

21:33.326 --> 21:36.894
I'M ALONE HERE ALL DAY
WITH A MUMMIFIED LEG.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.897
ASIDE FROM WONDERING HOW
I'M GONNA GO TO THE BATHROOM,

21:39.899 --> 21:42.133
I DO NOTHING BUT WORRY.

21:42.135 --> 21:44.769
THE BANK AND I HAVE
REACHED AN ACCOMMODATION.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.204
THEY'RE GONNA GIVE YOU A LOAN?

21:47.206 --> 21:49.740
SORT OF
A PROFESSIONAL COURTESY--

21:49.742 --> 21:52.076
SOMETHING TO HELP US
GET BACK ON OUR FEET.

21:52.078 --> 21:53.678
IT'S VERY SHORT TERM.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.881
SO WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY?

21:56.883 --> 21:58.115
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.186
YOU CONCENTRATE
ON GETTING WELL, OKAY?

22:10.697 --> 22:13.597
¶¶

22:23.643 --> 22:24.775
YOU DIDN'T CALL.

22:28.348 --> 22:29.613
SORRY.

22:31.317 --> 22:33.184
IT GOT LATE.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.852
WHAT'S THE WORD ON HANNA?

22:34.854 --> 22:37.722
SHE'S BETTER.

22:37.724 --> 22:38.989
THAT'S GREAT.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.558
DID THEY CATCH THE GUY
THAT DID IT?

22:40.560 --> 22:41.959
NOT YET.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.728
THE POLICE ARE TALKING
TO EVERYONE WHO WAS THERE

22:43.730 --> 22:46.097
TO SEE IF ANYONE SAW ANYTHING.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.804
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING?

22:53.806 --> 22:56.073
WHO TOLD YOU
I WAS AT THE CAMPGROUND?

22:56.075 --> 22:57.875
I SAW YOU IN THE CROWD

22:57.877 --> 23:00.177
WHEN THEY WERE PUTTING HANNA
IN THE AMBULANCE.

23:00.179 --> 23:03.314
I WASN'T SURE THEN,
BUT I'M SURE NOW. IT WAS YOU.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.752
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A JOKE.

23:07.754 --> 23:10.254
A JOKE?

23:10.256 --> 23:13.391
YEAH, LIKE A MOVIE--
BUNCH OF GIRLS IN THE WOODS.

23:13.393 --> 23:16.093
I WENT OUT THERE
TO GIVE YOU GUYS A SCARE.

23:16.095 --> 23:19.497
I SAW YOU GOING OFF,
SO I FOLLOWED YOU...

23:22.201 --> 23:23.801
FOLLOWED YOU TO HIS CAR.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.069
YOU WROTE ON THE WINDOW.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.404
I SHOULD'VE THROWN A ROCK.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.005
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

23:28.007 --> 23:30.007
ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT WHY YOU
ACT SO SQUIRRELY AROUND HIM.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.545
WHAT DID HE PROMISE YOU
TO GET YOU IN THAT CAR?

23:34.547 --> 23:36.347
I'LL GO TO THE PRINCIPAL
WITH YOU.
THE PRINCIPAL?

23:36.349 --> 23:38.783
YOU CAN TAKE THIS GUY DOWN
FOR WHAT HE MADE YOU DO.

23:38.785 --> 23:41.218
NOEL...
THEY CAN PUT HIM IN JAIL.

23:41.220 --> 23:44.422
NOEL, STOP.
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

23:51.330 --> 23:52.863
THEN WHAT IS IT LIKE?

23:52.865 --> 23:55.199
IF YOU CARE ABOUT ME AT ALL,

23:55.201 --> 23:57.868
PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING
TO ANYONE.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.171
JUST LET ME HANDLE IT.

24:00.173 --> 24:02.039
PROMISE ME.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.774
( bell rings )

24:03.776 --> 24:04.975
I HAVE TO GO.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.411
NOEL, PLEASE.
PROMISE ME.

24:12.718 --> 24:14.752
ALL RIGHT.

24:14.754 --> 24:15.853
I PROMISE.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.158
( sighs )

24:21.160 --> 24:23.861
DO YOU KNOW WHEN AGENT COOPER
WILL BE BACK?

24:23.863 --> 24:26.530
IT'S ABOUT TOBY CAVANAUGH.

24:26.532 --> 24:30.534
I WANT TO KNOW IF HE'S
ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY VISITORS.

24:30.536 --> 24:35.539
NO, I'M NOT FAMILY.
I'M A FRIEND.

24:35.541 --> 24:37.975
JUST HAVE HER
CALL ME BACK, PLEASE.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.376
THANK YOU.

24:39.378 --> 24:41.178
HE DOESN'T WANNA SEE YOU.

24:43.316 --> 24:46.717
AND EVEN IF HE DID,
I WOULDN'T LET HIM.

24:46.719 --> 24:50.621
HE'S BEEN HURT, EMILY.
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

24:50.623 --> 24:53.224
I DIDN'T TELL THE POLICE
WHERE HE WAS.

24:53.226 --> 24:55.693
BUT LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.328
YOU'VE MADE HIM RUN AWAY.

24:57.330 --> 25:00.030
THE POLICE CAME TO OUR HOUSE
BECAUSE OF YOU.

25:00.032 --> 25:03.133
THEY FOUND THAT SWEATER
BECAUSE OF YOU.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.771
LET ME TALK TO HIM, PLEASE.

25:07.773 --> 25:11.642
NO. I'M NOT GONNA LET ANYONE
COME BETWEEN US AGAIN.

25:16.916 --> 25:20.451
SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE
COME BETWEEN YOU TWO
A LONG TIME AGO.

25:20.453 --> 25:23.153
MAYBE A SOCIAL WORKER
WITH A BUCKET OF ICE WATER.

25:26.225 --> 25:28.959
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY EVERYONE
THINKS YOU'RE THE SWEET ONE.

25:50.583 --> 25:52.216
DID YOU MISS ME?

25:52.218 --> 25:54.218
ALI.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.253
THEY SAID YOU WERE DEAD.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.389
YEAH, I HEARD THAT, TOO,

25:58.391 --> 26:00.391
BUT HERE I AM.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.626
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

26:02.628 --> 26:05.396
IT'S COMPLICATED, HANNA.

26:05.398 --> 26:08.566
REALLY COMPLICATED--
WORSE THAN ALGEBRA.

26:08.568 --> 26:12.036
WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU LEFT THE BARN?

26:12.038 --> 26:14.038
WE ALL WANNA KNOW.

26:15.608 --> 26:17.975
YOU ALREADY DO--

26:17.977 --> 26:20.444
THE FOUR OF YOU COMBINED.

26:20.446 --> 26:22.980
YOU REMEMBER
MORE ABOUT THAT NIGHT
THAN YOU THINK YOU DO.

26:29.855 --> 26:32.656
WHERE'D YOU GO?

26:32.658 --> 26:34.858
DID YOU MEET A BOY?

26:34.860 --> 26:36.293
NOEL?

26:36.295 --> 26:37.661
NOEL?

26:37.663 --> 26:39.997
( scoffs ) PLEASE.

26:39.999 --> 26:44.468
PLEASE, JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

26:44.470 --> 26:46.837
IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE,
DARLING.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.673
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

26:49.675 --> 26:52.343
BECAUSE I KNOW.

26:52.345 --> 26:56.113
YOU THINK THE TRUTH
IS SOME BIG SHINY DISCO BALL
OF PURITY?

26:56.115 --> 26:57.915
THEN GO AHEAD AND TRY IT.

26:57.917 --> 27:01.185
BE HONEST.
SEE WHAT IT GETS YOU.

27:01.187 --> 27:03.520
TELLING THE TRUTH
TO THE WRONG PERSON
AT THE WRONG TIME

27:03.522 --> 27:05.189
IS HOW I ENDED UP
WHERE I AM.

27:05.191 --> 27:07.191
TAKE IT FROM ME,

27:07.193 --> 27:10.094
YOU'RE ALWAYS BETTER OFF
WITH A REALLY GOOD LIE.

27:16.636 --> 27:17.635
GOTTA GO.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.371
WHERE?

27:22.441 --> 27:25.376
I WAS SO SCARED
THAT YOU WERE GONNA DIE.

27:25.378 --> 27:27.945
THAT'S WHY I CAME BACK.

27:27.947 --> 27:29.613
I DIDN'T CARE
HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS,

27:29.615 --> 27:30.848
I HAD TO SEE YOU.

27:33.586 --> 27:36.353
YOU KNOW, I REALLY SHOULD DO
SOMETHING ABOUT "A."

27:36.355 --> 27:39.056
THAT BITCH IS GENUINELY
GETTING ON MY NERVES.

27:49.735 --> 27:50.768
( sighs )

28:06.052 --> 28:07.584
I WAS GONNA LOOK FOR YOU.

28:09.221 --> 28:11.055
I THINK WE NEED TO TALK.

28:11.057 --> 28:16.193
YEAH, UH, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE CAR SITUATION.

28:16.195 --> 28:19.596
COMMON SENSE KICKED IN
ABOUT THIRD PERIOD.

28:19.598 --> 28:21.031
YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.267
SOMEBODY PROBABLY JUST
DOESN'T LIKE THE WAY I PARK.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.837
( girls laughing )

28:28.708 --> 28:32.276
YEAH, BUT YOU ARE RIGHT
ABOUT THERE BEING OTHER PEOPLE.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.778
WE HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL.

28:34.780 --> 28:36.780
I'VE BEEN CAREFUL.

28:36.782 --> 28:39.283
REMEMBER,
CAREFUL MADE YOU UNHAPPY.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.018
YOU DON'T MAKE ME UNHAPPY.

28:44.690 --> 28:48.325
YOU TOTALLY MESS ME UP,
AND I FEEL MISERABLE SOMETIMES,

28:48.327 --> 28:50.060
BUT YOU DON'T MAKE ME UNHAPPY.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.498
I WASN'T UNHAPPY
THE OTHER NIGHT.

28:58.637 --> 28:59.503
BUT?

29:00.940 --> 29:02.072
BUT...

29:06.846 --> 29:09.213
WOULD YOU
GO BACK IF YOU COULD?

29:09.215 --> 29:12.216
IF YOU KNEW THAT IT
WOULD BE THIS COMPLICATED,

29:12.218 --> 29:15.486
WOULD YOU HAVE EVEN TALKED TO ME
THAT FIRST DAY IN THE BAR?

29:21.127 --> 29:22.826
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

29:22.828 --> 29:25.796
IF I HAD LEFT
BEFORE YOU WALKED IN,

29:25.798 --> 29:28.198
WE'D HAVE NO PROBLEMS.

29:28.200 --> 29:31.435
YOU'D JUST BE A PRETTY GIRL
THAT SITS ONE ROW OVER
FROM THE WINDOWS,

29:31.437 --> 29:34.104
AND I'D BE THE NEW TEACHER.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.173
ALL NEAT AND TIDY.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.875
( both chuckle )

29:39.979 --> 29:42.012
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

29:42.014 --> 29:42.946
TO GO BACK?

29:44.483 --> 29:45.415
NO.

29:46.652 --> 29:48.185
ME NEITHER.

29:48.187 --> 29:51.155
SO WE DON'T GO BACK.

29:51.157 --> 29:54.691
WE GO FORWARD...
TOGETHER.

29:54.693 --> 29:57.127
Emily: DID YOU TELL MR. FITZ
ABOUT NOEL?

29:57.129 --> 29:59.596
HIS NAME'S EZRA.

29:59.598 --> 30:04.034
MAYBE<i> YOU</i> GET TO CALL HIM EZRA,
HE'S STILL MR. FITZ TO US.

30:04.036 --> 30:06.036
DID YOU TELL HIM?

30:06.038 --> 30:07.037
NO, I COULDN'T.

30:07.039 --> 30:08.038
ARIA...

30:08.040 --> 30:09.339
WELL, HOW COULD I?

30:10.843 --> 30:13.210
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
YOU AND NOEL?

30:13.212 --> 30:15.212
THERE ISN'T A "ME AND NOEL."

30:15.214 --> 30:17.047
THERE NEVER REALLY WAS.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.816
DOES HE KNOW THAT?

30:18.818 --> 30:20.017
I THINK HE DOES.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.885
YOU<i> THINK</i> HE DOES.

30:21.887 --> 30:25.222
YEAH, I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW HARD TO PUSH HIM,

30:25.224 --> 30:27.524
BUT I KNOW THAT
IT'S A ONE-WAY STREET.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.660
SO ONCE I SAY SOMETHING
TO ANYBODY,

30:29.662 --> 30:31.829
I CAN'T TAKE IT BACK.

30:31.831 --> 30:33.063
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

30:35.534 --> 30:37.401
PUDDING-CUP-ALOOSA.

30:37.403 --> 30:41.905
VANILLA, TAPIOCA,
BUTTERSCOTCH.

30:41.907 --> 30:43.907
UH, TAPIOCA.

30:43.909 --> 30:45.542
I LIKE THE LITTLE BUMPS.

30:47.479 --> 30:48.579
( whistles )

30:52.384 --> 30:54.585
THAT'S STARTING TO LOOK LIKE
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.

30:56.689 --> 30:59.790
YOU KNOW, LUCAS,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP
SKIPPING SCHOOL.

30:59.792 --> 31:01.191
I'M OKAY.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.427
I TOLD THE OFFICE I WAS
DOING COMMUNITY SERVICE.

31:03.429 --> 31:04.895
AND THEY BELIEVED YOU?

31:04.897 --> 31:06.129
I HAVE A VERY BELIEVABLE FACE.

31:06.131 --> 31:08.365
I PLAN TO USE IT IN POLITICS.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.434
WELL, YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND.

31:11.837 --> 31:12.836
THANKS.

31:14.940 --> 31:17.975
YOU KNOW,
BEING FRIENDS WITH SOMEBODY...

31:17.977 --> 31:20.644
THAT CAN BE
MORE IMPORTANT SOMETIMES

31:20.646 --> 31:24.114
THAN GETTING TO KNOW THEM
IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.049
MM-HMM.

31:26.051 --> 31:29.920
YEAH, UH,
I HAVE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

31:29.922 --> 31:32.789
THEY HAVE ME ON
ALL KINDS OF DRUGS AND THINGS,

31:32.791 --> 31:37.294
AND SOMETIMES
THINGS CAN BE A LITTLE...

31:37.296 --> 31:39.029
I DON'T KNOW, UM...

31:39.031 --> 31:42.232
THE MEDICAL TERM FOR WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS "LOOPY."

31:42.234 --> 31:44.568
RIGHT, LOOPY.

31:44.570 --> 31:47.905
I MEAN, I HAVE LIKE
<i> TWILIGHT ZONE</i> MOMENTS--

31:47.907 --> 31:52.342
FUNNY DREAMS,
JUST REALLY UNEXPECTED STUFF--

31:52.344 --> 31:56.013
AND IT CAN BE CONFUSING.

31:56.015 --> 31:58.382
"DID I JUST SEE THAT?
WAS THAT PERSON REALLY HERE?

31:58.384 --> 32:00.817
DID I IMAGINE THAT WHOLE THING
JUST HAPPENED?"

32:00.819 --> 32:04.121
"DID LUCAS ACTUALLY KISS ME
WHEN HE THOUGHT I WAS ASLEEP?"

32:04.123 --> 32:06.490
YEAH, THINGS LIKE THAT.

32:08.494 --> 32:10.861
I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN AWAKE,

32:10.863 --> 32:13.664
AND THEN I THOUGHT
"IF SHE WAS AWAKE

32:13.666 --> 32:16.700
AND SHE DIDN'T SCREAM,
THEN THAT WAS A GOOD SIGN."

32:16.702 --> 32:19.503
WELL, I WAS TOO SURPRISED
TO DO ANYTHING.

32:19.505 --> 32:22.506
REALLY?
YOU WERE THAT SURPRISED?

32:22.508 --> 32:24.341
ME WANTING TO KISS YOU

32:24.343 --> 32:25.642
WAS SO OUTSIDE
THE REALM OF PROBABILITY?

32:25.644 --> 32:27.811
NO. NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

32:27.813 --> 32:29.813
IT'S JUST...

32:29.815 --> 32:31.682
I THOUGHT THAT
WE WERE FRIENDS.

32:31.684 --> 32:33.283
( sighs )

32:33.285 --> 32:34.785
LOOK, I LIKE YOU, LUCAS.

32:34.787 --> 32:37.621
I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE BREAKING UP WITH ME,

32:37.623 --> 32:39.823
BUT WE WERE
NEVER REALLY TOGETHER.

32:39.825 --> 32:42.159
LUCAS,
I AM BEING HONEST WITH YOU,

32:42.161 --> 32:43.927
AND BESIDES,
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

32:43.929 --> 32:45.729
AND I THINK YOU DESERVE
A BETTER BOYFRIEND.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.700
WELL,
THAT'S BETWEEN ME AND SEAN.

32:49.702 --> 32:53.370
LOOK, I LIKE YOU WAY TOO MUCH
TO LIE TO YOU,

32:53.372 --> 32:57.240
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
I USED TO DO ALL THE TIME.

32:57.242 --> 33:00.210
COULDN'T YOU JUST KEEP LYING,
JUST FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE?

33:03.749 --> 33:05.248
I'M SORRY.

33:07.886 --> 33:10.354
NO, WAIT, LUCAS,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE.

33:10.356 --> 33:11.822
NO, BUT IF I STAY,
YOU'RE GONNA THINK

33:11.824 --> 33:13.423
THAT I'M OKAY ABOUT THIS,
AND I'M NOT.

33:15.094 --> 33:17.227
I'M SORRY.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.895
I'M JUST BEING HONEST.

33:26.939 --> 33:28.472
Emily: I DON'T KNOW, MAYA.

33:28.474 --> 33:30.974
I MEAN,
WITH HANNA IN THE HOSPITAL,

33:30.976 --> 33:33.477
EVERYTHING'S ON HOLD.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.979
YEAH.

33:35.981 --> 33:38.015
I MISS YOU, TOO.

33:41.553 --> 33:42.686
MAYBE TOMORROW?

33:44.356 --> 33:45.222
( chuckles )

33:46.392 --> 33:47.391
I GOTTA GO.

33:48.527 --> 33:49.693
RIGHT, BYE.

33:51.797 --> 33:52.996
WAS THAT HANNA?

33:52.998 --> 33:55.165
NO. MAYA.

33:55.167 --> 33:56.700
DOES MOM
NEED HELP WITH DINNER?

33:56.702 --> 33:57.968
NO, NOT YET.

33:57.970 --> 33:59.002
OKAY.

34:00.239 --> 34:01.705
DO YOU REMEMBER DENNIS SMALL?

34:02.975 --> 34:04.608
YEAH.

34:04.610 --> 34:08.578
HE TOLD ME THAT HE HEARD
YOU'VE BEEN CALLING THE STATION,

34:08.580 --> 34:11.581
THAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO VISIT THIS TOBY CAVANAUGH.

34:11.583 --> 34:15.952
DO YOU WANNA TELL ME WHY YOU'RE
TRYING TO TALK TO THIS BOY?

34:15.954 --> 34:17.454
I WANT HIM TO KNOW
THAT IT WASN'T ME

34:17.456 --> 34:18.955
WHO TOLD THE POLICE
WHERE TO FIND HIM.

34:18.957 --> 34:21.124
HAS HE THREATENED YOU
IN ANY WAY?

34:21.126 --> 34:22.325
NO.

34:24.897 --> 34:26.963
WHAT IS IT?

34:26.965 --> 34:29.533
YOUR MOTHER THINKS YOU'RE
KEEPING SOME KIND OF SECRET.

34:29.535 --> 34:31.701
YOU'VE BEEN JUMPY
SINCE I GOT HOME.

34:31.703 --> 34:34.004
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT IT WAS
'CAUSE I HADN'T BEEN AROUND,
BUT THAT'S NOT IT.

34:34.006 --> 34:35.806
SOMETHING'S EATING YOU.

34:35.808 --> 34:39.676
IT'S LIKE YOU SAID,
I'M JUST A LITTLE JUMPY.

34:39.678 --> 34:43.580
YOU TELL ME
WHO'S GIVING YOU A HARD TIME,
AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.082
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

34:45.084 --> 34:47.651
IF YOU NEED HELP,
YOU ASK FOR IT.

34:47.653 --> 34:49.453
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED ABOUT.

34:49.455 --> 34:50.887
DAD...

34:50.889 --> 34:52.756
I'M GONNA TALK
TO TOBY CAVANAUGH MYSELF.

34:52.758 --> 34:53.924
I'M GONNA PUT AN END TO IT.

34:53.926 --> 34:55.692
I'M NOT AFRAID OF TOBY.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.761
YOU'RE AFRAID OF SOMETHING.
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.830
NOW, WHAT IS IT?

34:59.832 --> 35:02.466
I'M AFRAID OF YOU AND MOM.

35:02.468 --> 35:04.301
WHY ARE YOU AFRAID OF US?

35:05.771 --> 35:08.105
BECAUSE I'M NOT
WHO YOU THINK I AM.

35:08.107 --> 35:09.272
( chuckles )

35:09.274 --> 35:11.475
YOU'RE EMILY FIELDS,
MY LITTLE GIRL.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.810
I'D KNOW YOU ANYWHERE.
I GOT A PICTURE OF YOU
IN MY WALLET.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.712
I'M EIGHT YEARS OLD
IN THAT PICTURE.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.817
THAT'S A DIFFERENT GIRL.

35:20.819 --> 35:22.152
IT'S THE SAME GIRL.

35:22.154 --> 35:24.221
WE JUST NEED A NEW PICTURE.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.690
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.558
EMILY...

35:30.496 --> 35:32.195
I'M GAY.

35:37.069 --> 35:39.136
I'M GAY.

35:55.821 --> 35:58.488
A BAR? YOU MET HIM IN A BAR?

35:58.490 --> 36:01.992
IT'S NOT A BAR,
IT'S A PUB.

36:01.994 --> 36:04.327
AND HE HIT ON YOU?

36:04.329 --> 36:06.796
YEAH, WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT WRITING.

36:06.798 --> 36:08.632
YEAH,
READ ANY GOOD BOOKS LATELY?

36:08.634 --> 36:10.033
HEY, SERIOUSLY.

36:10.035 --> 36:12.469
BOY, I'LL TELL YOU,
PART OF ME THINKS

36:12.471 --> 36:14.638
THIS IS REALLY
SELF-DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR,

36:14.640 --> 36:17.307
BUT MOST OF ME JUST THINKS
IT'S REALLY HOT.

36:17.309 --> 36:20.744
SPENCE, DON'T TEASE, OKAY?

36:20.746 --> 36:23.713
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF FUNNY.

36:23.715 --> 36:26.049
I'M SORRY.

36:26.051 --> 36:28.051
IT'S JUST...

36:28.053 --> 36:31.087
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO REACT TO ALL OF THIS.

36:31.089 --> 36:32.722
YEAH, NEITHER DO I.

36:35.127 --> 36:37.427
SHOW ME THE STUPID TREE, OKAY?

36:37.429 --> 36:38.862
YEAH, IT'S RIGHT OVER HERE.

36:53.078 --> 36:54.644
YOU ARE NOT GONNA TELL ME...

36:54.646 --> 36:58.582
NO, THIS WAS IT.
IT WAS RIGHT HERE.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.383
WAIT, ARE YOU SURE
THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT SPOT?

37:00.385 --> 37:01.718
I'M SURE.

37:01.720 --> 37:02.819
IT'S GONE.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.467
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING
SHE CAME UP WITH ON HER OWN.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.135
IT'S THAT GIRL
FROM CALIFORNIA--MAYA.

37:19.137 --> 37:21.104
BEFORE WE START
TALKING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE,

37:21.106 --> 37:22.906
LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT EMILY.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.474
WHY DIDN'T SHE TELL US?

37:24.476 --> 37:26.243
SHE WAS AFRAID.

37:26.245 --> 37:27.744
OF ME?

37:27.746 --> 37:28.945
OF BOTH OF US.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.580
SHE'S NOT AFRAID OF US.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.215
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT
SHE'S AFRAID OF?

37:37.322 --> 37:39.322
THIS IS WHAT SHE'S AFRAID OF.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.231
WHERE'D YOU GET THESE?

37:48.233 --> 37:50.166
SOMEBODY MAILED IT TO ME--

37:50.168 --> 37:51.801
SOMEONE WHO WANTED ME TO KNOW.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.637
YOU HAD THIS,
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

37:53.639 --> 37:55.272
WHEN WAS I SUPPOSED
TO TELL YOU?

37:55.274 --> 37:56.573
WHEN YOU WALKED
THROUGH THE DOOR

37:56.575 --> 37:58.408
AFTER BEING GONE
FOR EIGHT MONTHS?

37:58.410 --> 38:00.443
IS THAT HOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO WELCOME YOU HOME?

38:05.317 --> 38:07.684
HOW ARE WE GONNA FIX THIS?

38:07.686 --> 38:09.819
FIX IT?

38:09.821 --> 38:13.790
THIS IS NOT LIKE
BUYING HER BRACES.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.025
IT'S WHO SHE IS.

38:15.027 --> 38:16.860
THAT'S NOT WHO SHE IS.

38:16.862 --> 38:19.763
THIS IS WHAT SOMEONE ELSE
IS MAKING HER INTO.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.432
MAYBE SHE'S JUST EXPERIMENTING.

38:22.434 --> 38:23.900
THIS IS WRONG.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.402
THIS IS COMPLETELY WRONG,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.804
DO YOU THINK I LIKE THIS?
I DON'T.

38:27.806 --> 38:31.174
BUT WHEN I WENT IN THERE,
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
SHE WAS GONNA TELL ME.

38:31.176 --> 38:34.044
I THOUGHT, SWEET GOD,
WHAT IS THIS? DRUGS?

38:34.046 --> 38:36.012
THIS TOBY KID
GET HER PREGNANT?

38:36.014 --> 38:39.849
LET'S JUST KEEP THIS
IN PERSPECTIVE.

38:39.851 --> 38:42.018
WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE
ON RIGHT AND WRONG?

38:42.020 --> 38:44.854
SHE IS STRUGGLING WITH THIS.
I CAN SEE IT.

38:44.856 --> 38:45.989
AND I CAN'T?

38:45.991 --> 38:47.057
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

38:47.059 --> 38:48.892
WELL, THEN WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

38:48.894 --> 38:51.261
ARE YOU WILLING
TO JUST TURN AWAY

38:51.263 --> 38:53.630
FROM EVERYTHING
WE EVER WANTED FOR HER?

38:53.632 --> 38:55.765
LET HER RUIN HER LIFE
SO SHE CAN EXPERIMENT?

38:57.836 --> 38:59.369
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

38:59.371 --> 39:01.705
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR VALUES?

39:01.707 --> 39:04.207
DID YOU JUST LEAVE THEM OUT
IN THE DESERT SOMEWHERE?

39:04.209 --> 39:06.509
I TOLD YOU I DON'T LIKE THIS.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.178
( sighs )

39:08.180 --> 39:11.247
BUT SHE IS ALIVE AND HEALTHY,

39:11.249 --> 39:13.583
AND AFTER EVERYTHING
I'VE SEEN,

39:13.585 --> 39:16.486
ALIVE AND HEALTHY
COUNTS FOR A LOT, BELIEVE ME.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.796
WE SHOULD CALL EM AND HANNA.

39:26.798 --> 39:29.232
WE'LL TALK TO THEM
AT THE HOSPITAL.

39:29.234 --> 39:32.068
A TREE, SPENCE, AN ENTIRE TREE.

39:36.641 --> 39:39.609
I WOULD'VE SETTLED
FOR JUST CRANBERRY JUICE.

39:41.246 --> 39:43.747
OH, YOU FOUND MY STASH.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.749
SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH, RIGHT?

39:45.751 --> 39:46.916
YEAH.

39:46.918 --> 39:49.052
WELL, YOU HAVE GREAT TIMING.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.954
GRAB SOME GLASSES.
MELISSA'S OUT IN THE BARN.

39:50.956 --> 39:54.624
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT I'M CELEBRATING
BEFORE I DRINK TO IT.

39:54.626 --> 39:56.760
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
CELEBRATING TO DRINK CHAMPAGNE.

39:56.762 --> 39:58.795
THAT'S VERY
OLD-FASHIONED THINKING.

39:58.797 --> 40:01.598
YOU CANCELED
PRACTICE TODAY.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.433
YES, I DID.

40:03.435 --> 40:06.169
TO BE WITH MELISSA?

40:06.171 --> 40:07.871
YES.

40:07.873 --> 40:08.772
WHY?

40:11.109 --> 40:13.843
UH, YOU KNOW,
WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT
AND TALK TO YOUR SISTER?

40:13.845 --> 40:16.279
NO. I THINK I'D LIKE
TO HEAR THIS FROM YOU.

40:18.483 --> 40:19.883
WE'RE MARRIED.

40:19.885 --> 40:21.151
( both chuckle )

40:21.153 --> 40:23.920
YOU'RE--YOU'RE WHAT?

40:23.922 --> 40:25.321
WE ELOPED.

40:25.323 --> 40:27.257
Ian: YEAH, IT'S INCREDIBLE.

40:27.259 --> 40:28.792
IT'S LIKE LAST YEAR
NEVER HAPPENED.

40:31.530 --> 40:32.395
CONGRATULATIONS.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.999
DO--DO MOM AND DAD KNOW?

40:36.001 --> 40:38.168
NOT YET.

40:38.170 --> 40:42.739
YEAH, WE EXPECT
THEY'LL BE A LITTLE, UM...
SURPRISED.

40:42.741 --> 40:45.141
SURPRISED?
( chuckles )

40:45.143 --> 40:48.812
THIS IS WHAT I WANT.
THEY'LL UNDERSTAND.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.480
YOU'LL HELP ME WITH THEM.

40:50.482 --> 40:52.682
I KNOW I CAN COUNT ON YOU.

40:58.089 --> 40:59.989
ALL RIGHT, UH,
BRING SOME GLASSES.
WE'LL HAVE A TOAST.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.131
SPENCE, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

41:37.829 --> 41:41.197
YOU TOLD THEM?

41:41.199 --> 41:42.365
YEAH.

41:42.367 --> 41:43.833
HOW WAS THAT?

41:43.835 --> 41:45.902
ROUGH.

41:45.904 --> 41:48.371
HEY, IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

41:48.373 --> 41:53.209
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GONNA BE,
BUT IT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.213
I GUESS SO.

41:58.717 --> 42:00.250
SO THE WHOLE TREE?

42:00.252 --> 42:02.752
YEAH, LOCK, STOCK,
AND BIRD'S NEST.

42:02.754 --> 42:04.320
WHY?

42:04.322 --> 42:07.891
WHY SHOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND THEN JUST TAKE IT AWAY?

42:07.893 --> 42:10.793
LIKE "A"
HAD A SPLIT PERSONALITY.

42:10.795 --> 42:14.130
THAT'S GREAT--
HOMICIDAL AND NUTS.

42:14.132 --> 42:19.636
WE'VE BEEN THINKING
MAYBE WE'RE DEALING WITH
MORE THAN ONE PERSON.

42:19.638 --> 42:22.772
"A" AND ALI'S KILLER
ARE TWO SEPARATE PEOPLE?

42:22.774 --> 42:24.874
YOU ARE FREAKING OUT
THE INVALID.

42:24.876 --> 42:26.209
NO, THINK ABOUT IT.

42:26.211 --> 42:27.810
NO, YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

42:27.812 --> 42:30.146
AREN'T WE IN ENOUGH TROUBLE?

42:30.148 --> 42:32.181
I KNOW I AM. JUST LOOK AT ME.

42:35.587 --> 42:39.088
HANN. HANN, WHO WROTE THIS?

42:39.090 --> 42:40.623
I DON'T KNOW.

42:40.625 --> 42:42.058
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
IN AND OUT ALL DAY,
AND SO HAVE I.

42:43.361 --> 42:45.194
OH, NO.
WHAT?

42:45.196 --> 42:47.497
WHAT? WHAT'S ON THERE?

42:47.499 --> 42:52.702
"SORRY ABOUT LOSING MY TEMPER.
MY BAD. LOVE, A."

42:52.704 --> 42:54.304
( gasping )

42:54.306 --> 42:55.838
WHO PUT THAT ON MY LEG?

42:55.840 --> 42:57.273
WHO WROTE THAT?

42:57.275 --> 42:58.808
DID SOMEBODY COME IN HERE
WHILE YOU WERE ASLEEP?

42:58.810 --> 43:01.311
I DON'T KNOW.
JUST GET IT OFF!
JUST WIPE IT OFF!

43:01.313 --> 43:03.646
( gasping )
