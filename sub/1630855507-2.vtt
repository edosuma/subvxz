10:23.013 --> 10:24.798
I assumed he became

with women's breasts all day,

10:28.976 --> 10:30.325

10:32.327 --> 10:34.242
He said he became
a plastic surgeon

10:34.285 --> 10:37.941
because he didn't want
his patients to die.

In fact, I doubt it
makes the top five.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.943
- Here comes the real parenting.
I can feel it.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.119
- No.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.948
No, this is woman to
you're-gonna-be-a-woman-soon,

13:41.342 --> 13:43.561
whether you like it or not:

13:43.605 --> 13:46.086
if you love him even a little,

13:46.129 --> 13:48.044
you'll find a way to show him.

13:48.088 --> 13:49.306
He could really
use it right now.

13:50.351 --> 13:52.396
- Why? What happened?

13:55.051 --> 13:59.447
- He had to tell parents of a
girl who doesn't have your luck,

13:59.490 --> 14:01.362
that she's celebrated
her last Christmas.

14:03.016 --> 14:04.278
[music]

14:07.977 --> 14:09.936
You get in another
fight at school

14:09.979 --> 14:13.156
and I swear I'll smash this
thing with a fucking hammer.

14:17.291 --> 14:18.901
How's that for parenting?

14:23.210 --> 14:24.080
[door closes]

14:31.522 --> 14:33.655
- You don't have to cook
for them tonight, honey.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.135
Make them a sandwich.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.484
- Well, a sandwich isn't supper.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.486
- Usually my supper.

14:38.529 --> 14:39.966
- Well, it's not your
supper tonight.

14:40.009 --> 14:41.619
- All right, chef.

14:41.663 --> 14:43.099
What are we having?

14:43.143 --> 14:45.101
- We're having
a little bolognese.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.146
- Mmm.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.017
- Are you still off gluten?

14:48.061 --> 14:49.366
- I've been in the desert
for six months, baby.

14:49.410 --> 14:52.326
-I'll lick gluten
off this counter.
- Mm.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.371
I find that visual
oddly appealing.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.117
[Neal clears throat]

15:01.161 --> 15:02.118
Hey, you have your mother
to thank for your phone.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.119
[crying]
- I'm sorry.

15:03.163 --> 15:06.035
I'm sorry I made
your bad day worse.

15:06.079 --> 15:08.516
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, honey.

15:08.559 --> 15:09.952
Thank you.
It's okay.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.003
- How's that for love?

15:18.395 --> 15:20.136
- Wow...

15:20.180 --> 15:21.398
You two must have had
quite the breakthrough.

15:30.494 --> 15:33.106

17:50.112 --> 17:51.113
[phone rings]

17:52.636 --> 17:53.942
- Fuck it.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.117
- You need to get that?

17:55.161 --> 17:56.336
- No.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.253
[moaning]

18:00.296 --> 18:01.645
- That's yours.
- Don't stop.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.735
[Joe moans]

18:04.779 --> 18:06.389
- Fuck.

18:06.433 --> 18:09.392
- Hey. Put the pedal to
the medal, buddy. Let's go.

18:09.436 --> 18:10.567
- I'm trying.
- [laughing]

18:10.611 --> 18:12.526
- I'm gonna pull something.

18:17.096 --> 18:21.100
[Joe moaning]

18:23.276 --> 18:25.060
[phone ringing continues]

18:34.069 --> 18:36.332
- Hello.
- Yeah.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.204
All right, have the attending
stabilize and prep.

18:38.247 --> 18:39.596
I'll be there in thirty minutes.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.207
- No, Langley's closer.
We fly from there.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.383
- All right.

18:45.733 --> 18:46.995
[panting]

18:47.038 --> 18:48.997
- We snuck one in
under the wire.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.172
- [chuckles]

18:50.216 --> 18:52.261
- Will you be home by morning?

18:52.305 --> 18:55.177
- No.
- You?

18:55.221 --> 18:58.311
- I doubt it.
- What about the kids?

18:58.354 --> 18:59.616
- Kids are used to it, honey.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.273
- Yeah.

19:04.317 --> 19:07.320
[music]

19:13.848 --> 19:16.851
- Hey, kiddo. I gotta go.
I have surgery.

19:16.894 --> 19:19.375
Will you make Charlie breakfast
in the morning?

19:19.419 --> 19:22.335
- Why can't mom do it?

19:22.378 --> 19:24.685
- Mom's got an emergency, too.

19:24.728 --> 19:27.383
- Someone needs an
emergency translator?

19:27.427 --> 19:29.646
- Honey, I don't begin
to understand politics.

19:29.690 --> 19:32.432
If you need anything
call Stan next door.

19:32.475 --> 19:33.868
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know the drill.

19:38.525 --> 19:39.961
[beeping]

19:48.099 --> 19:49.623
- Why do you have a gun?

19:53.192 --> 19:55.063
- To protect the people
I work with.

19:55.106 --> 19:56.369
- They don't have people
for that?

19:56.412 --> 19:57.718
They need you to do it?

19:57.761 --> 19:59.154
- They need everyone to do it.

20:01.112 --> 20:02.288
Out.

No!

23:53.693 --> 23:56.086

23:56.130 --> 23:58.132
- Breathe in.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.700
Breathe the water.
Breathe it in.

24:00.743 --> 24:01.483
Good girl.

24:03.224 --> 24:05.313
Breathe the water.

25:21.824 --> 25:24.523
- This was a fucking
training exercise?

25:24.566 --> 25:28.788
- Survive.
Evade. Resist.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.485
- I've been through S.E.R.E,
you fucking bitch!

25:30.529 --> 25:33.575
- To achieve your objective,
you must blow your cover.

25:33.619 --> 25:37.579
Can you escape before they
know what you've done?

25:37.623 --> 25:39.363
Most can't.

25:39.407 --> 25:41.583
What's more likely is
you are taken

25:41.627 --> 25:43.759
and must survive
until we reach you.

25:43.803 --> 25:46.806
And I need to know how much time
I have to do that

25:46.849 --> 25:48.721
before it's too late.

25:51.288 --> 25:53.421
Before you break.

25:53.464 --> 25:54.770
- I won't break.

25:54.814 --> 25:55.815
- Everyone breaks.
- Not me.

25:55.858 --> 25:57.686
- Everyone.

26:00.776 --> 26:03.779
- You want me to turn
around again, huh?

26:03.823 --> 26:06.652
That's how you fucking
like it, right?

26:06.695 --> 26:11.657
- What I like
is bringing agents home.

26:14.703 --> 26:17.793
What I don't like is writing
letters to their parents

26:17.837 --> 26:20.796
explaining how they died in
some bullshit training exercise

26:20.840 --> 26:23.146
because I can't tell
them that their daughter

26:23.190 --> 26:25.671
was beheaded
then set on fire.

26:28.543 --> 26:31.502
Of course, I don't have to
worry about that with you.

26:31.546 --> 26:33.766
You don't have any parents.

26:33.809 --> 26:36.246
Should I send
the letter to Edgar?

26:36.290 --> 26:38.597
Boy, you pick winners.

26:40.816 --> 26:43.123
He's dead.
Did you know that?

26:44.515 --> 26:47.823
Beaten, stabbed and shot.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.738
Like someone made
a game of it.

26:55.701 --> 26:58.791
I bet you were quite the dancer.

26:58.834 --> 27:01.445
If we're going
to call that dancing.

27:01.489 --> 27:02.664
I bet you were
good at it, though.

27:06.755 --> 27:10.367
Why'd you stop?
Hmm?

27:10.411 --> 27:13.240
Did somebody get a little rough
in the Champagne Room?

27:13.283 --> 27:15.590
Have his way and you weren't
strong enough to stop him?

27:15.634 --> 27:18.245
And now here you are,
proving how strong you are?

27:20.987 --> 27:22.379
That sound about right?

27:25.556 --> 27:27.558
Looks like these boys
had their way, too.

27:28.864 --> 27:33.913
There's always someone bigger.
Stronger.

27:33.956 --> 27:35.828
But you know that,
don't you?

27:38.657 --> 27:40.702
That's the story of your life.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.621
Can't be broken, huh?

27:49.798 --> 27:52.366
[music]

27:55.761 --> 27:56.849
Time for round two.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.241
- [sobbing]

28:08.382 --> 28:10.384
- I need her to sign the waiver
to take it any further.

28:10.427 --> 28:11.994
- She doesn't exist
to sign the waiver.

28:12.038 --> 28:13.822
- If she's here, she exists.

28:13.866 --> 28:15.606
Someone's signing it,
I don't give a shit who.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.957
- Give it to me.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.959
When her focus is
on the questions,

28:20.002 --> 28:21.264
take her to the ground.

28:21.308 --> 28:22.570
Restrain her movement.

28:22.613 --> 28:24.006
That'll be the thing
that breaks her.

28:24.050 --> 28:25.791
- I want someone from
Funny in there.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.967
I don't need this shit
coming back on me in a year.

28:28.010 --> 28:29.925
- I'm here.
- You're a fucking spy.

28:29.969 --> 28:32.798
Trust you as far
as I can throw you.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.625
Mag, you're with me.

28:35.801 --> 28:36.845
[electric crackle]

28:47.508 --> 28:48.770
[electric crackle]

29:02.958 --> 29:05.526
So what was his name?

29:05.569 --> 29:06.962
Hmm?

29:07.006 --> 29:08.790
[Cruz humming]

29:08.834 --> 29:10.531
- What was his name?

29:11.837 --> 29:13.664
It's right here in the file.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.886
I just want to
hear you say it.

29:17.930 --> 29:18.844
You can say it.

29:19.932 --> 29:22.848
[humming continues]

29:24.066 --> 29:25.459
You wanna hear me say it?

29:28.505 --> 29:30.420
Josecito.

29:30.464 --> 29:31.595
[humming stops]

29:34.642 --> 29:38.951
You don't know your father,
your mother's at work.

29:38.994 --> 29:42.955
Brother don't seem like
the baby sitting type.

29:42.998 --> 29:44.347
So, it must've been you.

29:45.087 --> 29:46.959
Huh?

29:47.002 --> 29:48.917
You were the one watching
him when he died, huh?

29:50.832 --> 29:52.007
You fucked up.

29:54.096 --> 29:57.012
- You think this is going to
make me a better operator?

29:57.056 --> 30:00.929
- No. This has nothing to do
with being an operator.

30:02.975 --> 30:06.500
This is how you survive when
the operator in you is done.

30:07.893 --> 30:10.504
You gotta know where you break

30:10.547 --> 30:12.027
so you can learn
to push it further.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.902
You're gonna learn.

30:29.436 --> 30:30.829

30:54.722 --> 30:58.073
[Cruz] No! No! No! No!

30:58.117 --> 31:00.771
Nooooo!

31:00.815 --> 31:02.164
- That's enough.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.818
- No, no, no.
She's almost there.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.515
- I make it a point to
avoid Congressional hearings,

31:05.559 --> 31:07.126
and this is gonna
put us in front of one.

31:07.169 --> 31:08.910
She's done.

31:08.954 --> 31:10.607
- She's done when
I say she's done.

31:10.651 --> 31:13.088
- I don't see any stripes
on your fucking shirt.

31:13.132 --> 31:15.743
She's done when
I say she's done,

31:15.786 --> 31:16.962
and she's done.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.444
- Master Sergeant, stand down.
- What are you doing?

31:21.488 --> 31:24.839
Cody, call's in, stand down.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.975
[grunts]

31:33.065 --> 31:34.936

31:38.853 --> 31:40.028
- Motherfucker!

31:41.856 --> 31:42.857
[screaming]

31:42.901 --> 31:45.947
- Easy. It's over.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.994
Hey. Stand the
fuck down, marine.

31:49.037 --> 31:50.952
You proved your
fucking point.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.041
Now stand down.

31:54.086 --> 31:55.783
Now she thinks she won.

31:55.826 --> 31:56.958
- I'm pretty positive she
doesn't feel like a winner.

31:57.002 --> 31:59.482
- I need to know
her breaking point.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.484
And now I don't.

32:01.528 --> 32:05.184
- She looks pretty fucking
broke to me.

32:05.227 --> 32:07.012
- She's on a suicide mission,
and you know it.

32:09.231 --> 32:11.016
I was just trying
