[chattering]

01:22.343 --> 01:23.779
[chattering]

01:33.745 --> 01:35.225
- So the mark is in Paris?

01:35.269 --> 01:36.487
- New York.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.446
- You said Paris.

01:38.489 --> 01:41.188
- First, she was in Paris
now she's in New York.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.538
- How did they leave it?
- They exchanged numbers.

01:43.581 --> 01:45.844
Been texting.

01:45.888 --> 01:47.281
- What about social media?

01:47.324 --> 01:48.717
You building a profile?

01:48.759 --> 01:50.762
- Cruz said her father
wouldn't let her.

01:51.807 --> 01:54.853
- [laughs]
Smart girl.

01:54.896 --> 01:56.203
- Yes.

01:59.249 --> 02:00.381
- But?

02:00.424 --> 02:02.383
- I want to put her
through the grinder.

02:02.426 --> 02:04.167
- She's been
through the grinder.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.300
- I'm doing everything
different this time.

02:06.343 --> 02:08.345
- She's your field agent.

02:08.389 --> 02:09.564
Do what you think's best.

02:10.651 --> 02:12.393
You want recon to run it?

02:12.436 --> 02:15.439
- CAG.
If you don't mind.

02:18.312 --> 02:19.356
I have to be sure.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.362
- All right.

02:25.406 --> 02:27.582
She's at Bragg?

02:27.625 --> 02:29.410
- I have her in an apartment.

02:29.453 --> 02:31.673
- In an apartment?
- One of ours.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.414
I can't have fifty green berets
asking her where she's been.

02:33.457 --> 02:34.241
- What if the mark
comes to Georgetown

02:34.284 --> 02:35.677
and decides to go shopping

02:35.720 --> 02:37.331
and runs into her
on the fucking street?

02:37.374 --> 02:39.289
- People don't leave New York
to shop in Georgetown.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.422
Get her out of the apartment.

02:41.465 --> 02:42.204
- Yes, ma'am.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.212
- How are you?

02:52.389 --> 02:53.434
- I'm good.

02:55.523 --> 02:56.698
- How's Neal?

02:58.395 --> 02:59.918
- He's good.

03:02.704 --> 03:03.922
- How's Neal?

03:06.316 --> 03:07.187
- We do the best we can.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.755
- That's all we can do.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.496
How are the girls?

03:12.540 --> 03:15.325
- Girls are great.

03:15.369 --> 03:17.675
Charlie, she's doing
great in school.

03:19.373 --> 03:20.548
And Kate...

03:28.556 --> 03:29.731
They're good kids.

03:31.776 --> 03:33.430
[shrieking,
chanting "Fight, fight!"]

03:33.474 --> 03:35.432
[whistle blowing]

03:43.527 --> 03:45.486
- It's metastasized into
the ocular orbit

03:45.529 --> 03:47.401
and pressing up on
the frontal lobe.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.316
But it's also pressing down
on the temporal lobe.

03:49.359 --> 03:51.840
So there's your blurred vision,
there's your memory loss

03:51.883 --> 03:53.624
and there's your loss of smell.

03:53.668 --> 03:54.712
- What do you think?

03:54.756 --> 03:56.497
- Enucleation immediately.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.716
- Then see what we can get
through the ocular orbit, but...

03:58.760 --> 04:00.370
- Craniotomy doesn't look
like an option--

04:00.414 --> 04:01.676
- I can't get in there.

04:01.719 --> 04:03.417
The tumor's against her face.

04:03.460 --> 04:04.722
I'd have to remove her
infraorbital foramen

04:04.766 --> 04:06.289
and probably the nasal bone.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.770
- Could a reconstructive surgeon
re-graft that?

04:08.813 --> 04:10.337
- I mean...

04:10.380 --> 04:12.339
This is terminal,
why do it to her?

04:12.382 --> 04:13.731
- I'm aware.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.342
I need to
present the options.

04:15.385 --> 04:16.298
She's out of options, Neal.

04:16.343 --> 04:17.692
- You wanna tell
the parents that?

04:17.735 --> 04:19.476
You wanna tell them
their six year-old

04:19.519 --> 04:20.911
isn't having migraines,
she's got a tumor

04:20.956 --> 04:22.479
the size of
a fucking baseball?

04:22.523 --> 04:23.480
She's seen her last birthday?

04:23.524 --> 04:24.612
- Fuckin' surgeons.

04:24.655 --> 04:27.397
- Chemo's not an option.
- No.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.356
- Start her on radiation
and see if you can shrink

04:29.399 --> 04:31.619
that thing before
I get in there.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.403
You know what kid's gonna look
like when I'm done with her?

04:33.447 --> 04:35.623
- I wouldn't do it either, Gary.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.277
But it's not my
decision to make.

04:45.589 --> 04:46.590
- You want company?

04:46.634 --> 04:47.765
- Yeah, very much.

04:49.071 --> 04:50.638
Jenny, we're ready.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.907
[door opens]

04:58.950 --> 05:02.432
- Two doctors.
This can't be good.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.086
Now three.

05:04.129 --> 05:07.698
- Maddy, do you know what
I have down the hall?

05:07.742 --> 05:09.483
- What?
- I have a toy store.

05:09.526 --> 05:10.788
- [gasps]

05:10.832 --> 05:12.529
- Now, it's no
ordinary toy store.

05:12.573 --> 05:14.357
This one doesn't
take any money.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.403
- Why not?

05:16.446 --> 05:18.796
- Well, because
everything's free.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.668
And every time you
come to see me

05:20.711 --> 05:22.626
you can pick out
whatever toy you want.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.454
- What's the catch?

05:24.498 --> 05:26.021
- No catch.

05:26.064 --> 05:27.631
Miss Jenny'll take you there
right now

05:27.675 --> 05:28.893
if it's okay
with your folks.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.678
- It's okay, honey.
Go ahead.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.511
- What is it?

05:37.554 --> 05:40.514
- This is Dr. Ramirez,
she is a radiologist--

05:40.557 --> 05:43.430
- What is it?

05:43.473 --> 05:44.561
- It's a brain tumor.

05:47.564 --> 05:48.957
- How big?

05:49.000 --> 05:52.482
- Seventy-six millimeters.

05:52.526 --> 05:53.614
- How big is that?

05:56.530 --> 05:57.531
- In her head?

05:57.574 --> 05:59.010
- Yeah.

05:59.054 --> 06:02.100
- So... what do we do?
What are our options?

06:02.144 --> 06:03.798
- The tumor has metastasized,

06:03.841 --> 06:07.628
which means it's spread
beyond the front of her brain.

06:07.671 --> 06:08.890
- Spread where?

06:08.933 --> 06:10.674
- It spread to her eye.

06:10.718 --> 06:15.679
Now, we can begin radiation
with hopes

06:15.723 --> 06:17.507
of reducing the size
of the tumor.

06:17.551 --> 06:20.597
And if that's successful,
we can then attempt to remove

06:20.641 --> 06:22.643
as much of the tumor
as possible,

06:22.686 --> 06:26.734
but we would have to begin
with removing her eye.

06:26.777 --> 06:28.518
- [sobs]

06:28.562 --> 06:30.607
[music]

06:30.651 --> 06:32.653
- Hey, hey, hey.

06:32.696 --> 06:34.698
Baby, baby.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.004
- [sobbing]

06:40.008 --> 06:42.053
- We just have to listen
to what he's got to say, okay.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.459
- Can she survive it?

06:59.506 --> 07:00.855
- No.

07:02.683 --> 07:03.988
- How long?

07:04.032 --> 07:05.163
- He doesn't know
she can't survive.

07:05.207 --> 07:08.471
- How long?
- Six months.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.647
- How long with the surgery?

07:10.691 --> 07:13.084
- If she survives the surgery,

07:13.128 --> 07:15.826
if her body responds
to further treatment...

07:15.870 --> 07:20.091
This is a very aggressive
cancer, we won't get all of it.

07:20.135 --> 07:22.616
I don't know how long.

07:22.659 --> 07:23.747
- You don't know?

07:23.791 --> 07:25.619
I want a second opinion.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.751
- I highly recommend
you get one.

07:27.795 --> 07:31.146
- After the surgery,
what's her life like?

07:32.756 --> 07:34.062
- Her life is pain.

07:37.152 --> 07:38.457
[Mother] What do we do?

07:41.635 --> 07:43.593
- You spend as much
time with her

07:43.637 --> 07:46.727
doing the things
that she loves.

07:48.598 --> 07:49.686
[Mother] You don't think
we should do it?

07:49.730 --> 07:50.818
- No, I don't.

07:53.603 --> 07:54.604
- You motherfucker!

07:54.648 --> 07:56.911
Don't try anything?

07:56.954 --> 07:59.522
Don't try anything?!

07:59.566 --> 08:02.090
Fuck you! Fuck you!

08:03.744 --> 08:04.962
- Neal, you're bleeding.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.703
Go to the ER.

08:06.747 --> 08:07.530
I'll make sure someone
calls the police.

08:07.574 --> 08:08.575
- I'm fine.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.794
- Neal, he assaulted you.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.709
- I would've done
the same thing.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.755
[phone rings]

08:15.669 --> 08:16.757
- It's the school.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.633
- There is no excuse,
do you understand me?

08:23.677 --> 08:25.069
- You didn't hear
what she called me.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.767
- It doesn't matter
what she called you.

08:26.810 --> 08:29.770
- It doesn't matter to you.

08:29.813 --> 08:32.076
I can't have this
conversation with a white man.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.991
- With a--

08:34.034 --> 08:35.645
[tires squeal]

08:37.647 --> 08:40.128
I am your father before
I am anything else.

08:40.171 --> 08:41.650
Do you understand me?

08:41.695 --> 08:43.610
Here's all you did today:

08:43.653 --> 08:45.089
you got suspended from school

08:45.133 --> 08:48.702
and you forfeited a win
for your team. That's it.

08:48.745 --> 08:50.834
You can't beat the hate
out of someone, Kate.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.619
- No. But you can try.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.230
- Just like your mother.

08:55.273 --> 08:57.232
[music]

09:20.690 --> 09:22.692
- Mom, he took my phone.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.086
- Why would he do that?

09:25.129 --> 09:27.044
- Because...

09:27.088 --> 09:28.742
- I'll talk with him.

09:30.831 --> 09:33.050
[music]

09:46.760 --> 09:48.239
- Hey.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.026
- I'll get us another.

10:00.904 --> 10:03.211
So, dear.
How was your day?

10:03.254 --> 10:04.865
[laughs]

10:04.908 --> 10:08.825
I'm guessing that didn't happen
over a parking space.

10:08.869 --> 10:12.002
- I was having drinks with a
classmate from medical school.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.961
Do you remember Valentino?

10:14.004 --> 10:16.920
Italian model-looking prick?

10:16.964 --> 10:18.922
- I remember his teeth.
- [laughs]

10:18.966 --> 10:22.970
He became a plastic surgeon.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.798
I assumed he became
a plastic surgeon

10:24.841 --> 10:28.932
because he wanted to play
with women's breasts all day,

10:28.976 --> 10:30.325
but I was wrong.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.242
He said he became
a plastic surgeon

10:34.285 --> 10:37.941
because he didn't want
his patients to die.

10:40.465 --> 10:44.644
So, he bolts on tits for
a decade, and he feels bored.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.908
Unimportant.

10:47.951 --> 10:51.302
So, he joined a reconstructive
surgery firm that's, you know,

10:51.346 --> 10:54.262
trying to make people resemble
the people they were

10:54.305 --> 10:58.701
before the car accident
or the house fire.

10:58.745 --> 11:02.009
And...

11:02.052 --> 11:05.708
there was this girl,
this Homecoming Queen

11:05.752 --> 11:10.017
thrown from a vehicle,
skidded face-first

11:10.060 --> 11:11.975
down the street
about 100 meters.

11:12.019 --> 11:13.847
Shaves off most of her face,

11:13.890 --> 11:16.980
her cheekbones, her nose.

11:17.024 --> 11:19.809
He spent sixteen hours
reconstructing her face

11:19.853 --> 11:21.724
and she died in recovery.

11:23.813 --> 11:27.817
And he quit.
He fucking quit.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.951
He teaches anatomy
now at Georgetown.

11:32.953 --> 11:36.086
And he asked me how I do it,
knowing that

11:36.130 --> 11:40.351
half my patients aren't gonna
see their 18th birthday.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.271
And I said because
the other half will.

11:58.195 --> 12:00.894
- Does that make losing
the first half hurt less?

12:01.242 --> 12:03.461
- Fuck no.

12:09.903 --> 12:10.730
- Can I have my phone?

12:13.297 --> 12:15.865
You getting a divorce?

12:15.909 --> 12:17.301
- Go back inside.

12:27.094 --> 12:27.877
[knocking]

12:27.921 --> 12:30.924
[music playing]

12:30.967 --> 12:31.968
- Your father said no iPad.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.187
- This isn't an iPad.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.058
- I know.
It's a broken computer.

12:35.102 --> 12:37.408
- It's not broken.
- It will be in thirty seconds.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.241
- Are you getting a divorce?

12:45.939 --> 12:47.418
- That what you think?

12:47.462 --> 12:48.811
- Don't bother fighting
for custody

12:48.855 --> 12:49.943
because I want to
go live with him.

12:49.986 --> 12:51.858
- I would, too.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.381
- I'm sorry to tell you:
we're not getting divorced.

12:57.254 --> 12:58.821
What do you want to
be when you grow up?

12:58.865 --> 13:00.214
- I'm already grown up.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.911
- [scoffs]

13:01.955 --> 13:03.391
You're so far from grown up

13:03.434 --> 13:05.306
you can't even see it
from where you are.

13:06.611 --> 13:09.440
And idea?
Any dreams?

13:12.922 --> 13:15.055
- Something important.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.534
- Better think about
that real hard.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.188
'cause those important jobs,
they come with a price.

13:18.232 --> 13:23.019
- I know.
I'm the price.

13:23.063 --> 13:25.065
- Contrary to what you
might think:

13:25.108 --> 13:26.893
you getting suspended
is not the worst thing

13:26.936 --> 13:29.025
that's happened to
your father today.

13:29.069 --> 13:30.984
In fact, I doubt it
makes the top five.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.943
- Here comes the real parenting.
I can feel it.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.119
- No.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.948
No, this is woman to
you're-gonna-be-a-woman-soon,

13:41.342 --> 13:43.561
whether you like it or not:

13:43.605 --> 13:46.086
if you love him even a little,

13:46.129 --> 13:48.044
you'll find a way to show him.

13:48.088 --> 13:49.306
He could really
use it right now.

13:50.351 --> 13:52.396
- Why? What happened?

13:55.051 --> 13:59.447
- He had to tell parents of a
girl who doesn't have your luck,

13:59.490 --> 14:01.362
that she's celebrated
her last Christmas.

14:03.016 --> 14:04.278
[music]

14:07.977 --> 14:09.936
You get in another
fight at school

14:09.979 --> 14:13.156
and I swear I'll smash this
thing with a fucking hammer.

14:17.291 --> 14:18.901
How's that for parenting?

14:23.210 --> 14:24.080
[door closes]

14:31.522 --> 14:33.655
- You don't have to cook
for them tonight, honey.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.135
Make them a sandwich.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.484
- Well, a sandwich isn't supper.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.486
- Usually my supper.

14:38.529 --> 14:39.966
- Well, it's not your
supper tonight.

14:40.009 --> 14:41.619
- All right, chef.

14:41.663 --> 14:43.099
What are we having?

14:43.143 --> 14:45.101
- We're having
a little bolognese.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.146
- Mmm.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.017
- Are you still off gluten?

14:48.061 --> 14:49.366
- I've been in the desert
for six months, baby.

14:49.410 --> 14:52.326
-I'll lick gluten
off this counter.
- Mm.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.371
I find that visual
oddly appealing.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.117
[Neal clears throat]

15:01.161 --> 15:02.118
Hey, you have your mother
to thank for your phone.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.119
[crying]
- I'm sorry.

15:03.163 --> 15:06.035
I'm sorry I made
your bad day worse.

15:06.079 --> 15:08.516
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, honey.

15:08.559 --> 15:09.952
Thank you.
It's okay.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.003
- How's that for love?

15:18.395 --> 15:20.136
- Wow...

15:20.180 --> 15:21.398
You two must have had
quite the breakthrough.

15:30.494 --> 15:33.106

17:50.112 --> 17:51.113
[phone rings]

17:52.636 --> 17:53.942
- Fuck it.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.117
- You need to get that?

17:55.161 --> 17:56.336
- No.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.253
[moaning]

18:00.296 --> 18:01.645
- That's yours.
- Don't stop.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.735
[Joe moans]

18:04.779 --> 18:06.389
- Fuck.

18:06.433 --> 18:09.392
- Hey. Put the pedal to
the medal, buddy. Let's go.

18:09.436 --> 18:10.567
- I'm trying.
- [laughing]

18:10.611 --> 18:12.526
- I'm gonna pull something.

18:17.096 --> 18:21.100
[Joe moaning]

18:23.276 --> 18:25.060
[phone ringing continues]

18:34.069 --> 18:36.332
- Hello.
- Yeah.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.204
All right, have the attending
stabilize and prep.

18:38.247 --> 18:39.596
I'll be there in thirty minutes.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.207
- No, Langley's closer.
We fly from there.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.383
- All right.

18:45.733 --> 18:46.995
[panting]

18:47.038 --> 18:48.997
- We snuck one in
under the wire.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.172
- [chuckles]

18:50.216 --> 18:52.261
- Will you be home by morning?

18:52.305 --> 18:55.177
- No.
- You?

18:55.221 --> 18:58.311
- I doubt it.
- What about the kids?

18:58.354 --> 18:59.616
- Kids are used to it, honey.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.273
- Yeah.

19:04.317 --> 19:07.320
[music]

19:13.848 --> 19:16.851
- Hey, kiddo. I gotta go.
I have surgery.

19:16.894 --> 19:19.375
Will you make Charlie breakfast
in the morning?

19:19.419 --> 19:22.335
- Why can't mom do it?

19:22.378 --> 19:24.685
- Mom's got an emergency, too.

19:24.728 --> 19:27.383
- Someone needs an
emergency translator?

19:27.427 --> 19:29.646
- Honey, I don't begin
to understand politics.

19:29.690 --> 19:32.432
If you need anything
call Stan next door.

19:32.475 --> 19:33.868
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know the drill.

19:38.525 --> 19:39.961
[beeping]

19:48.099 --> 19:49.623
- Why do you have a gun?

19:53.192 --> 19:55.063
- To protect the people
I work with.

19:55.106 --> 19:56.369
- They don't have people
for that?

19:56.412 --> 19:57.718
They need you to do it?

19:57.761 --> 19:59.154
- They need everyone to do it.

20:01.112 --> 20:02.288
Out.

No!

23:53.693 --> 23:56.086

23:56.130 --> 23:58.132
- Breathe in.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.700
Breathe the water.
Breathe it in.

24:00.743 --> 24:01.483
Good girl.

24:03.224 --> 24:05.313
Breathe the water.

25:21.824 --> 25:24.523
- This was a fucking
training exercise?

25:24.566 --> 25:28.788
- Survive.
Evade. Resist.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.485
- I've been through S.E.R.E,
you fucking bitch!

25:30.529 --> 25:33.575
- To achieve your objective,
you must blow your cover.

25:33.619 --> 25:37.579
Can you escape before they
know what you've done?

25:37.623 --> 25:39.363
Most can't.

25:39.407 --> 25:41.583
What's more likely is
you are taken

25:41.627 --> 25:43.759
and must survive
until we reach you.

25:43.803 --> 25:46.806
And I need to know how much time
I have to do that

25:46.849 --> 25:48.721
before it's too late.

25:51.288 --> 25:53.421
Before you break.

25:53.464 --> 25:54.770
- I won't break.

25:54.814 --> 25:55.815
- Everyone breaks.
- Not me.

25:55.858 --> 25:57.686
- Everyone.

26:00.776 --> 26:03.779
- You want me to turn
around again, huh?

26:03.823 --> 26:06.652
That's how you fucking
like it, right?

26:06.695 --> 26:11.657
- What I like
is bringing agents home.

26:14.703 --> 26:17.793
What I don't like is writing
letters to their parents

26:17.837 --> 26:20.796
explaining how they died in
some bullshit training exercise

26:20.840 --> 26:23.146
because I can't tell
them that their daughter

26:23.190 --> 26:25.671
was beheaded
then set on fire.

26:28.543 --> 26:31.502
Of course, I don't have to
worry about that with you.

26:31.546 --> 26:33.766
You don't have any parents.

26:33.809 --> 26:36.246
Should I send
the letter to Edgar?

26:36.290 --> 26:38.597
Boy, you pick winners.

26:40.816 --> 26:43.123
He's dead.
Did you know that?

26:44.515 --> 26:47.823
Beaten, stabbed and shot.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.738
Like someone made
a game of it.

26:55.701 --> 26:58.791
I bet you were quite the dancer.

26:58.834 --> 27:01.445
If we're going
to call that dancing.

27:01.489 --> 27:02.664
I bet you were
good at it, though.

27:06.755 --> 27:10.367
Why'd you stop?
Hmm?

27:10.411 --> 27:13.240
Did somebody get a little rough
in the Champagne Room?

27:13.283 --> 27:15.590
Have his way and you weren't
strong enough to stop him?

27:15.634 --> 27:18.245
And now here you are,
proving how strong you are?

27:20.987 --> 27:22.379
That sound about right?

27:25.556 --> 27:27.558
Looks like these boys
had their way, too.

27:28.864 --> 27:33.913
There's always someone bigger.
Stronger.

27:33.956 --> 27:35.828
But you know that,
don't you?

27:38.657 --> 27:40.702
That's the story of your life.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.621
Can't be broken, huh?

27:49.798 --> 27:52.366
[music]

27:55.761 --> 27:56.849
Time for round two.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.241
- [sobbing]

28:08.382 --> 28:10.384
- I need her to sign the waiver
to take it any further.

28:10.427 --> 28:11.994
- She doesn't exist
to sign the waiver.

28:12.038 --> 28:13.822
- If she's here, she exists.

28:13.866 --> 28:15.606
Someone's signing it,
I don't give a shit who.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.957
- Give it to me.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.959
When her focus is
on the questions,

28:20.002 --> 28:21.264
take her to the ground.

28:21.308 --> 28:22.570
Restrain her movement.

28:22.613 --> 28:24.006
That'll be the thing
that breaks her.

28:24.050 --> 28:25.791
- I want someone from
Funny in there.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.967
I don't need this shit
coming back on me in a year.

28:28.010 --> 28:29.925
- I'm here.
- You're a fucking spy.

28:29.969 --> 28:32.798
Trust you as far
as I can throw you.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.625
Mag, you're with me.

28:35.801 --> 28:36.845
[electric crackle]

28:47.508 --> 28:48.770
[electric crackle]

29:02.958 --> 29:05.526
So what was his name?

29:05.569 --> 29:06.962
Hmm?

29:07.006 --> 29:08.790
[Cruz humming]

29:08.834 --> 29:10.531
- What was his name?

29:11.837 --> 29:13.664
It's right here in the file.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.886
I just want to
hear you say it.

29:17.930 --> 29:18.844
You can say it.

29:19.932 --> 29:22.848
[humming continues]

29:24.066 --> 29:25.459
You wanna hear me say it?

29:28.505 --> 29:30.420
Josecito.

29:30.464 --> 29:31.595
[humming stops]

29:34.642 --> 29:38.951
You don't know your father,
your mother's at work.

29:38.994 --> 29:42.955
Brother don't seem like
the baby sitting type.

29:42.998 --> 29:44.347
So, it must've been you.

29:45.087 --> 29:46.959
Huh?

29:47.002 --> 29:48.917
You were the one watching
him when he died, huh?

29:50.832 --> 29:52.007
You fucked up.

29:54.096 --> 29:57.012
- You think this is going to
make me a better operator?

29:57.056 --> 30:00.929
- No. This has nothing to do
with being an operator.

30:02.975 --> 30:06.500
This is how you survive when
the operator in you is done.

30:07.893 --> 30:10.504
You gotta know where you break

30:10.547 --> 30:12.027
so you can learn
to push it further.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.902
You're gonna learn.

30:29.436 --> 30:30.829

30:54.722 --> 30:58.073
[Cruz] No! No! No! No!

30:58.117 --> 31:00.771
Nooooo!

31:00.815 --> 31:02.164
- That's enough.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.818
- No, no, no.
She's almost there.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.515
- I make it a point to
avoid Congressional hearings,

31:05.559 --> 31:07.126
and this is gonna
put us in front of one.

31:07.169 --> 31:08.910
She's done.

31:08.954 --> 31:10.607
- She's done when
I say she's done.

31:10.651 --> 31:13.088
- I don't see any stripes
on your fucking shirt.

31:13.132 --> 31:15.743
She's done when
I say she's done,

31:15.786 --> 31:16.962
and she's done.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.444
- Master Sergeant, stand down.
- What are you doing?

31:21.488 --> 31:24.839
Cody, call's in, stand down.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.975
[grunts]

31:33.065 --> 31:34.936

31:38.853 --> 31:40.028
- Motherfucker!

31:41.856 --> 31:42.857
[screaming]

31:42.901 --> 31:45.947
- Easy. It's over.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.994
Hey. Stand the
fuck down, marine.

31:49.037 --> 31:50.952
You proved your
fucking point.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.041
Now stand down.

31:54.086 --> 31:55.783
Now she thinks she won.

31:55.826 --> 31:56.958
- I'm pretty positive she
doesn't feel like a winner.

31:57.002 --> 31:59.482
- I need to know
her breaking point.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.484
And now I don't.

32:01.528 --> 32:05.184
- She looks pretty fucking
broke to me.

32:05.227 --> 32:07.012
- She's on a suicide mission,
and you know it.

32:09.231 --> 32:11.016
I was just trying
give her a shot.

32:13.192 --> 32:16.195
- Suicide missions don't
have a shot, Joe.

32:16.238 --> 32:17.022
Hence the name.

[dog barking]

32:50.707 --> 32:52.318
- What about her?

32:52.361 --> 32:53.493
What about her what?

32:53.536 --> 32:54.581
- She needs a badge.

32:54.624 --> 32:56.104
- She only needs my badge.

33:35.883 --> 33:37.580
- What's this?

33:37.624 --> 33:39.104
- Your new home.

33:39.147 --> 33:40.801
From now on you
stay with the team.

33:40.844 --> 33:42.933
- What about my gear?
- Your gear made its way over.

33:46.241 --> 33:48.330
What do you know
about Amrohi?

33:48.374 --> 33:51.246
- I don't know anything because
you won't tell me anything.

33:54.554 --> 33:56.904
- There's all sorts
of terrorists:

33:56.947 --> 33:58.862
there's fanatics,
there's megalomaniacs,

33:58.906 --> 34:01.865
religious extremists,
political extremists,

34:01.909 --> 34:03.345
race warriors.

34:03.389 --> 34:06.348
Amrohi is none of those.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.132
His brand of terrorism
is fueled

34:08.176 --> 34:12.137
by something
much simpler: greed.

34:12.179 --> 34:13.877
He is a prince who seeks
unrest on behalf

34:13.920 --> 34:17.228
of other princes so the hundred
and fifty million subjects

34:17.272 --> 34:19.795
of their regions keep
their focus on us:

34:19.840 --> 34:22.451
the great devil,
and never

34:22.495 --> 34:24.670
the half a trillion dollars
his family controls

34:24.714 --> 34:26.716
and does not share.

34:26.760 --> 34:31.721
If Aaliyah brings you close
and you get a chance

34:31.764 --> 34:33.853
and you seize that chance...

34:34.985 --> 34:36.291
Look at me.

You must find a way

34:45.648 --> 34:48.911

until I get there.

34:48.956 --> 34:50.739
That's what this was.

34:50.784 --> 34:52.960
Me trying to show
you what it will take.

34:53.003 --> 34:55.831
And me learning how much time
I have to get to you.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.793
- Don't bother.

34:59.836 --> 35:01.142
Just send the missile.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.839
I'm never going
through that again.

35:04.667 --> 35:08.802
- No. No, you won't.

35:08.845 --> 35:13.459
What they put you
through will be worse.

35:28.387 --> 35:30.563
- I see you,
don't fucking do it.

35:30.606 --> 35:32.434
- You don't see me.

35:32.478 --> 35:35.481
- I see you, and I'm saying
don't fucking do it.

35:35.524 --> 35:37.091
- This has nothing
to do with you, Bobby.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.311
- It does if one of
you motherfuckers starts...

35:39.354 --> 35:40.616

[fire alarm beeping]

35:53.803 --> 35:55.501
- Bobby, now I gotta open
all the fucking windows!

35:55.544 --> 35:57.981
- You know what, here's an idea,
why don't you practicing CQB

35:58.025 --> 36:00.419
in the fucking CQB house instead
of the damn living room?

36:00.462 --> 36:01.550
[Tex] Why the fuck would you do
that shit?

36:01.594 --> 36:02.856
[Bobby] Could someone turn
that shit off?

36:13.954 --> 36:15.651

36:15.695 --> 36:17.523

36:17.566 --> 36:19.612
We do bedrooms.

36:19.655 --> 36:21.614
- Got a bedroom for me?

36:21.657 --> 36:23.703
- You got mine.

36:23.746 --> 36:25.052
- Which way?

36:25.095 --> 36:26.445
- Down the hall.
Last door on the right.

36:26.488 --> 36:27.707
It's all yours, marine.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.709
- Shower?
- There's a shower in the room.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.145
- Don't drink two cups of
anything tonight,

36:31.189 --> 36:32.668
I'm in no fucking mood.

36:32.712 --> 36:34.322

36:34.366 --> 36:36.585

Don't see much chewing

[Two Cups] Just fucking get
a new one is what we gotta do,

and get a new fucking game.

38:08.764 --> 38:11.158
- Hey, have a seat.

38:13.682 --> 38:17.120
- Oh... Let me guess.

38:17.164 --> 38:18.339
I should see the other guy?

38:18.383 --> 38:20.123
- Other guy's gonna
need a nose job.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.256
- Nothing like getting
into a bar fight

38:22.300 --> 38:23.779
to keep a low profile.
Nice job.

38:23.823 --> 38:26.391
- Mm. Wasn't a bar fight.

38:26.434 --> 38:28.610

38:30.003 --> 38:31.439

38:31.483 --> 38:32.875
- Been through S.E.R.E.

38:32.919 --> 38:34.137
I don't know what
you'd call that.
