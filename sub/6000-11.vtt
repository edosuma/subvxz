00:00.249 --> 00:01.704
Previously on Finding Carter...

00:01.705 --> 00:02.904
You were going through something that was

00:03.051 --> 00:04.050
- really difficult.
- No.

00:04.136 --> 00:05.835
Don't make excuses for me.

00:05.887 --> 00:07.337
You love Taylor, Max.

00:07.422 --> 00:10.306
I know she loves you, too,
and I put myself first again.

00:10.342 --> 00:12.308
I miss you every day and what we have

00:12.344 --> 00:14.010
- is pretty incredible.
- Yeah, it is.

00:14.096 --> 00:15.895
I think we're gonna work things out.

00:15.981 --> 00:17.814
That's really great.

00:17.849 --> 00:19.983
I can't be with her
until she knows the truth.

00:20.018 --> 00:21.317
I really hope you're right.

00:21.353 --> 00:22.852
What is Carter's necklace doing in here?

00:26.024 --> 00:27.023
Max?

00:28.777 --> 00:30.693
Hey.

00:30.746 --> 00:33.196
- Where'd you find that?
- It was in the back of Max's truck.

00:33.281 --> 00:34.531
What was it doing there?

00:40.705 --> 00:42.255
Taylor, we have to tell you something.

00:42.340 --> 00:43.289
What?

00:43.375 --> 00:44.707
What's wrong?

00:44.793 --> 00:47.010
When we went to go visit Lori...

00:47.045 --> 00:48.294
Max and I slept together.

00:50.515 --> 00:51.714
You're kidding, right?

00:55.804 --> 00:57.103
Please tell me you're kidding.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.880
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:24.438 --> 01:25.471
Taylor, wait.

01:25.523 --> 01:26.772
Taylor, stop running.

01:26.807 --> 01:28.474
- Let us explain.
- Look, we made a mistake.

01:28.526 --> 01:30.276
- A mistake?!
- Taylor, it was all my fault.

01:30.311 --> 01:32.444
- I promise, it wasn't him.
- No, no, no, it was both of our faults,

01:32.480 --> 01:33.946
and if we could take it back, we would.

01:33.981 --> 01:34.813
Well, you can't!

01:34.969 --> 01:36.268
Yeah, we know that, Taylor.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.939
- Tay, I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

01:40.024 --> 01:41.807
Oh no.

01:41.892 --> 01:43.609
I'm sorry you guys feel so bad.

01:44.895 --> 01:47.279
But I can assure you
that I feel much worse.

01:57.708 --> 01:59.074
- This feels good.
- Yeah.

02:00.661 --> 02:01.794
I missed you.

02:07.051 --> 02:08.334
Ah, I remember that.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.301
So, um, I guess I'm gonna have to give you

02:10.388 --> 02:11.754
your sock drawer back.

02:11.806 --> 02:12.888
- Right?
- Yes.

02:12.923 --> 02:14.006
How is this gonna work?

02:14.091 --> 02:15.507
When do we tell the kids?

02:15.593 --> 02:16.675
Well, there's a couple
of grownups we should

02:16.761 --> 02:18.093
probably talk to first.

02:18.179 --> 02:19.595
Yes, of course.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.398
Is it gonna be a problem with Hillary?

02:22.433 --> 02:23.682
You guys have to teach together.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.851
You and Kyle have to work together.

02:25.936 --> 02:26.735
TouchÃ©.

02:28.272 --> 02:29.521
Ooh.

02:32.276 --> 02:33.609
SAT scores?

02:33.661 --> 02:35.110
You had it on your calendar, too?

02:35.196 --> 02:36.662
- Of course I did.
- Mm-hmm.

02:36.747 --> 02:39.448
But did you remember to
make the dinner reservations?

02:39.500 --> 02:40.616
Oh...

02:41.669 --> 02:42.835
Of course I did.

02:48.292 --> 02:50.626
I don't understand how
you could let this happen.

02:50.678 --> 02:52.127
It's not something that we planned.

02:54.131 --> 02:55.714
It was just a really bad moment.

02:55.800 --> 02:59.301
And you just thought, we're broken up...

02:59.353 --> 03:00.519
So it's okay?

03:00.604 --> 03:01.854
It's fine, we can do this?

03:01.939 --> 03:02.855
No, that's not what happened at all.

03:02.940 --> 03:03.972
And what about you?

03:04.058 --> 03:05.641
Did you think this was okay?

03:05.693 --> 03:07.643
- You're my sister.
- We should have stepped back.

03:07.728 --> 03:09.144
- We should have stopped.
- You think?

03:11.699 --> 03:14.116
Okay, look, Taylor, I'm not gonna sit here

03:14.151 --> 03:16.235
and try and explain this away, but...

03:16.320 --> 03:17.236
No, I can explain.

03:18.622 --> 03:21.040
Other people's feelings
do not register with you.

03:21.125 --> 03:23.125
Of course your feelings
matter to me, Taylor.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.327
Please tell me what I can
do to fix this, please?

03:26.997 --> 03:28.664
There's nothing either of you can do.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.335
But if I think of something,
I'll be sure to let you know.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.004
Hey.

03:36.090 --> 03:37.673
Welcome back, how was the trip?

03:38.926 --> 03:40.342
How was the cabin?

03:40.394 --> 03:42.594
- Um, it was... it was good, it was good.
- Uh-huh.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.762
Are you okay?

03:44.932 --> 03:46.515
What's wrong with this picture?

03:46.567 --> 03:48.267
Just... just tired.

03:48.352 --> 03:51.186
Your father and I thought
a getaway would help.

03:51.272 --> 03:53.188
- Help what?
- Well, just how hard it was

03:53.274 --> 03:55.441
when Carter went to see Lori.

03:55.526 --> 03:56.825
Yeah, I heard.

03:56.911 --> 03:58.243
But anyway, let's not talk about her.

03:58.329 --> 04:00.412
Do you guys remember what today is?

04:01.916 --> 04:03.081
The SAT scores.

04:04.552 --> 04:06.001
- Oh, now?
- Yes, come on!

04:09.340 --> 04:10.889
I'm gonna let you guys get to that.

04:10.925 --> 04:11.924
Max, stay.

04:11.976 --> 04:13.308
Can you convince him to stay?

04:15.479 --> 04:16.595
Yeah.

04:16.647 --> 04:17.678
Yeah, stay.

04:17.765 --> 04:19.348
Okay, come on.

04:34.865 --> 04:35.864
2,300.

04:35.950 --> 04:37.282
- 2,300?!
- Tay!

04:37.368 --> 04:38.951
Congratulations, Tay.
Taylor, that is amazing.

04:39.036 --> 04:40.252
It's okay.

04:40.287 --> 04:42.171
Honey, the best score you can get is 2,400.

04:42.256 --> 04:43.172
This is great.

04:43.257 --> 04:44.840
Oh, Carter, let's look.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.183
Average.

04:54.268 --> 04:56.635
Hey, nothing about you is average.

04:56.687 --> 04:57.886
Sweetie, under the circumstances,

04:57.972 --> 04:58.887
- that is incredible.
- Yes.

04:58.973 --> 05:00.355
Seriously.

05:00.441 --> 05:02.441
- And if you wanna retake it, you can.
- Yeah, maybe.

05:02.476 --> 05:05.444
Meanwhile, we are going
to celebrate, as a family,

05:05.479 --> 05:06.979
at the Italian Oven.

05:08.232 --> 05:09.815
No, no, no, no, no, no, I can't, I can't.

05:09.970 --> 05:11.186
Wait a minute, we've been planning this

05:11.221 --> 05:13.272
- for weeks, we told you.
- Yeah, come on.

05:13.357 --> 05:14.890
The pressure is finally off you guys.

05:14.942 --> 05:16.224
Family dinner.

05:16.277 --> 05:18.277
And, Max, we would love for you to join us.

05:18.362 --> 05:19.144
Yeah, thank you.

05:19.229 --> 05:20.145
I still have so many applications

05:20.230 --> 05:21.730
to do for internships

05:21.815 --> 05:23.115
and the sooner I figure out
what I'm doing this summer,

05:23.200 --> 05:24.483
the happier I'll be.

05:24.568 --> 05:26.451
Taylor, you guys got through the test,

05:26.537 --> 05:28.820
we are going to celebrate.

05:28.906 --> 05:30.706
Uh... okay.

05:30.741 --> 05:32.240
Yeah, dinner.

05:44.638 --> 05:46.722
Taylor, I know nothing
I could say right now

05:46.757 --> 05:48.090
is gonna make this better.

05:48.142 --> 05:49.091
I don't want you to have to put on

05:49.176 --> 05:50.559
a happy face for dinner.

05:50.594 --> 05:52.427
I'm just gonna tell them
I'm not feeling well.

05:52.479 --> 05:53.979
It's fine.

05:54.064 --> 05:56.181
Taylor, please let me
explain what happened.

05:57.685 --> 05:58.934
Carter, the last thing

05:58.986 --> 06:00.652
I want to hear is what happened between

06:00.738 --> 06:02.187
you and the first...

06:03.941 --> 06:05.607
... and only person I've ever loved.

06:11.782 --> 06:12.748
Okay.

06:14.084 --> 06:15.784
Yeah, I understand.

06:45.566 --> 06:46.565
I'll get it.

06:55.659 --> 06:57.075
- Surprise.
- Crash.

06:58.495 --> 07:00.662
Um...

07:00.714 --> 07:02.080
I'm so happy to see you.

07:09.938 --> 07:11.521
Hey.

07:11.607 --> 07:12.356
Look who's here.

07:12.408 --> 07:13.523
There he is.

07:16.328 --> 07:17.244
You made it.

07:17.329 --> 07:18.328
Wait, you knew he was coming?

07:18.364 --> 07:19.696
- We invited him.
- What?

07:21.700 --> 07:22.949
Detective Wilson.

07:23.035 --> 07:24.251
Come here.

07:26.538 --> 07:27.587
Impressive.

07:27.673 --> 07:29.756
So what's next, a run for Congress?

07:29.842 --> 07:32.008
Uh, I don't think they'll
let me run with my record.

07:32.044 --> 07:33.126
Oh, sure they will.

07:33.212 --> 07:34.928
I think it's a requirement.

07:35.013 --> 07:37.130
Well, we're glad that you're here.

07:37.216 --> 07:38.548
- You done with basic?
- Yeah.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.550
Uh, next I'll find out where I'm posted

07:40.602 --> 07:41.885
and then I'll get to pick a specialty.

07:41.937 --> 07:43.220
Oh, what are you interested in?

07:43.305 --> 07:45.105
Well, actually, there's
a program at Fort Bragg

07:45.190 --> 07:47.641
where they teach you do
to Special Forces stuff.

07:47.726 --> 07:48.608
Crisis management,

07:48.694 --> 07:50.610
combat driving and tactical operations.

07:50.696 --> 07:52.729
Oh, yeah, I can totally see you doing that.

07:52.781 --> 07:54.064
Well, you gotta love irony.

07:57.069 --> 08:00.070
Taylor got a perfect score on her SATs.

08:00.155 --> 08:02.906
Uh, almost perfect.

08:02.958 --> 08:04.241
Carter likes to exaggerate.

08:04.293 --> 08:06.710
It's one of her many character flaws.

08:06.745 --> 08:08.078
Congratulations, Taylor.

08:08.130 --> 08:09.880
Thank you, Crash.

08:09.915 --> 08:11.581
You too.

08:11.633 --> 08:14.084
Uh, Taylor, Crash is gonna
come to dinner with us.

08:14.169 --> 08:16.253
- Is that okay?
- Why not?

08:16.305 --> 08:17.754
The more the merrier.

08:23.929 --> 08:24.978
What's up with her?

08:25.063 --> 08:26.763
Um, she's mad at me.

08:29.935 --> 08:31.101
Wanna talk about it?

08:34.440 --> 08:35.938
Yeah.

08:35.991 --> 08:37.441
Yeah, I really do.

08:39.111 --> 08:40.025
But you know what?

08:40.111 --> 08:41.611
Let's, um...

08:41.697 --> 08:43.280
let's have dinner first.

08:43.332 --> 08:45.165
- Sounds good.
- Hey, where are you staying?

08:45.250 --> 08:46.333
Do you need to stay here?

08:46.418 --> 08:47.667
No, I got a hotel room in town.

08:47.753 --> 08:49.586
Crash, you could have stayed here.

08:49.621 --> 08:51.171
I didn't want to presume anything.

08:52.791 --> 08:54.424
Okay.

08:54.460 --> 08:56.760
Well, I have to get ready.

08:56.795 --> 08:59.296
Okay, how about I come back
in an hour and pick you up?

08:59.381 --> 09:01.548
We'll ride to dinner
together like we're on a date.

09:04.303 --> 09:05.936
That sounds good.

09:05.971 --> 09:07.304
Cool.

09:17.699 --> 09:19.199
Detective Wilson?

09:19.284 --> 09:20.650
Elizabeth.

09:22.070 --> 09:24.154
Um, I'm just on my way out.

09:24.239 --> 09:25.322
Aren't you coming to dinner with us?

09:25.407 --> 09:29.075
Yeah, of course, I just wanted to...

09:29.161 --> 09:30.660
I just wanted to ask you something.

09:30.712 --> 09:32.162
Mm-hmm.

09:32.247 --> 09:33.747
Did the cops ever nab my uncle?

09:33.832 --> 09:35.131
No, did he try to contact you?

09:35.167 --> 09:36.550
No, no, he doesn't know I enlisted,

09:36.635 --> 09:38.251
- so he wouldn't have any way of finding me.
- Good.

09:38.337 --> 09:39.669
Um, no.

09:39.721 --> 09:41.254
Word is that he left the state

09:41.340 --> 09:43.340
and he's setting up shop in North Carolina,

09:43.425 --> 09:44.841
but don't worry.

09:44.893 --> 09:46.560
We're gonna get him.

09:46.645 --> 09:48.011
Okay, thanks.

09:48.063 --> 09:49.179
Great, I'll be back in a little bit

09:49.264 --> 09:50.514
- to pick up Carter.
- Yeah, see you later.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.816
- See you, Mr. Wilson.
- See ya.

09:52.851 --> 09:54.568
Hey, ooh, I'm glad I caught you.

09:54.653 --> 09:56.853
Um, I'm gonna just have to
meet you at the restaurant,

09:56.905 --> 09:58.154
if that's okay.
- Why?

09:58.190 --> 09:59.439
Well, when we planned the dinner,

09:59.525 --> 10:01.608
I invited Gabe and Kyle

10:01.693 --> 10:03.527
and I need to tell him what's going on.

10:03.612 --> 10:04.861
Can't you call him? Might be easier.

10:04.913 --> 10:07.948
I just think that it's best if I just

10:08.033 --> 10:09.950
do it face to face.

10:10.035 --> 10:11.167
Wish me luck.

10:11.203 --> 10:12.536
Good luck.

10:23.215 --> 10:24.431
Are you gonna tell Crash?

10:25.517 --> 10:28.218
Yeah, of course I'm gonna tell him.

10:28.303 --> 10:30.387
Just need to find the right time.

10:31.440 --> 10:32.722
Good luck with that.

10:38.897 --> 10:40.196
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:40.232 --> 10:41.481
What are you doing here?

10:43.402 --> 10:44.701
Never mind, I don't care.

10:44.736 --> 10:45.819
Come in, come in.

10:47.906 --> 10:48.955
What can I get for you?

10:49.041 --> 10:50.156
A glass of wine?

10:50.242 --> 10:52.075
Uh, no, nothing.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.126
Thank you.

10:53.211 --> 10:55.328
I, um, I can't stay.

10:57.416 --> 10:58.582
What do you mean?

10:59.635 --> 11:01.251
I have to get to dinner.

11:03.672 --> 11:05.338
I thought we were going together.

11:09.394 --> 11:11.428
Kyle, I have to change our plans.

11:14.816 --> 11:15.932
Wow.

11:17.986 --> 11:20.103
Really?

11:20.188 --> 11:21.438
In person.

11:23.742 --> 11:24.941
I guess I should be grateful.

11:25.027 --> 11:26.526
- Can I please... we need to talk.
- Really?

11:26.612 --> 11:27.827
That's the line you're gonna use?

11:27.913 --> 11:30.080
- "We need to talk"?
- I promised you too much.

11:30.115 --> 11:31.114
I shouldn't have done that.

11:33.118 --> 11:34.367
You're not leaving him.

11:35.454 --> 11:37.454
I can see that I'm hurting you

11:37.506 --> 11:39.456
and I am so sorry.

11:39.541 --> 11:41.091
I had no idea that this was gonna

11:41.126 --> 11:43.460
- turn out the way it did.
- Come on, Liz.

11:43.545 --> 11:45.762
You might be sorry for hurting me,

11:45.797 --> 11:48.048
but you're not sorry that
this is where it's ending up.

11:51.803 --> 11:53.803
I don't want to leave him.

11:53.889 --> 11:55.722
And I don't want to leave my children.

11:55.807 --> 11:57.891
But you need to hear this.

11:57.976 --> 12:00.443
I loved you...

12:00.479 --> 12:02.979
and I loved what we had together.

12:03.031 --> 12:04.698
It saved me.

12:04.783 --> 12:06.199
You helped me get through some of

12:06.284 --> 12:08.401
the worst times of my life

12:08.487 --> 12:09.869
and I'll never forget that.

12:09.955 --> 12:12.822
I will care about you
forever because of it.

12:16.495 --> 12:17.877
I guess deep down I...

12:19.798 --> 12:22.499
... I always knew that
this is how things would go.

12:24.753 --> 12:27.637
But I loved you so much,
and I just ignored it.

12:27.673 --> 12:29.089
You know that this is the right thing.

12:30.676 --> 12:32.842
If it's okay with you,

12:32.928 --> 12:34.978
I really don't feel like
making you feel better

12:35.013 --> 12:36.846
about things right now.

12:36.932 --> 12:38.014
You should go.

12:40.435 --> 12:42.018
I'm sorry.

12:42.070 --> 12:43.019
Just go.

13:02.874 --> 13:04.874
Never been so thirsty in my life.

13:04.926 --> 13:07.043
Wish you'd been there, though.

13:07.129 --> 13:08.378
It was crazy.

13:10.799 --> 13:11.798
Crash?

13:14.886 --> 13:16.720
I really missed you.

13:16.805 --> 13:18.054
Couldn't have been more than I missed you.

13:19.558 --> 13:21.141
I'm sorry I didn't answer your letters.

13:22.527 --> 13:24.060
Oh, no, it's okay.

13:24.112 --> 13:25.478
I know they have rules.

13:25.564 --> 13:26.563
Yeah, that was part of it,

13:26.615 --> 13:27.864
but I felt really bad about

13:27.899 --> 13:29.566
what my uncle put everyone through.

13:31.737 --> 13:33.870
Crash, that wasn't your fault.

13:33.905 --> 13:36.656
But I appreciate you wanting to take

13:36.742 --> 13:38.158
responsibility for it.

13:41.463 --> 13:42.796
It's about time, right?

13:46.918 --> 13:48.168
Should have done it a long time ago.

13:56.061 --> 13:57.977
I guess we'd better go inside.

13:58.063 --> 13:59.095
Yeah.

14:18.893 --> 14:19.391
So what'd you do, like
combat scenarios and stuff?

14:19.443 --> 14:20.225
Yeah, some.

14:20.311 --> 14:21.393
And mostly, they just yell at you.

14:21.445 --> 14:22.945
"Full Metal Jacket," right?

14:23.030 --> 14:24.730
- You have not seen that movie.
- Yeah, I have.

14:24.799 --> 14:25.864
Hey, sorry I'm late.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.616
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.569
- Everything go okay?
- Yeah, barely okay.

14:30.654 --> 14:31.737
One down, one to go.

14:31.789 --> 14:32.738
Yeah, Hillary.

14:32.790 --> 14:34.156
Hey.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.325
- Hey, Max.
- Hey.

14:36.410 --> 14:38.243
Man, when did you get back?

14:38.295 --> 14:39.912
I just finished basic.

14:39.997 --> 14:42.331
- I'm in town for a couple of days, had to see Carter.
- Right on.

14:42.416 --> 14:43.582
- Dude, I like this.
- Thanks.

14:43.634 --> 14:45.250
- Yeah, it's weird.
- It's a good look.

14:45.302 --> 14:46.969
- Thanks.
- Max, sit.

14:48.839 --> 14:50.255
Hey, guys.

14:54.762 --> 14:55.928
Can you pass the bread?

14:55.980 --> 14:57.312
Yeah.

15:00.518 --> 15:01.600
Chow Fun.

15:01.652 --> 15:03.268
Oh, cool, Chinese.

15:03.354 --> 15:04.987
I thought we were going
out with the Wilsons.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.105
Yeah, I thought so, too.

15:10.828 --> 15:13.412
So Elizabeth won't be moving in with us.

15:13.447 --> 15:15.330
She decided to stay with David.

15:17.785 --> 15:19.117
That sucks, I'm sorry.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.120
She made you nothing but miserable.

15:22.206 --> 15:24.873
Yeah, well...

15:24.959 --> 15:26.792
I let it happen.

15:28.379 --> 15:30.512
I should have shut things
down a long time ago.

15:33.217 --> 15:34.349
- Let me see your phone.
- For what?

15:34.435 --> 15:35.634
- No, no...
- Come on, come on.

15:37.471 --> 15:38.854
- Tinder profile.
- No, no, no, no way.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.722
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Give it.

15:40.808 --> 15:42.191
Come on, are you kidding me?

15:42.276 --> 15:43.642
Handsome widowed cop?

15:43.727 --> 15:46.144
You're gonna have a ping
before the dumplings cool.

15:46.197 --> 15:47.729
I am handsome.

15:47.815 --> 15:49.147
But no thanks.

15:52.486 --> 15:54.152
How am I gonna go off to college

15:54.238 --> 15:56.288
- and not worry about you?
- Hey, slow down.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.656
You still have your senior year, okay?

15:57.708 --> 16:00.075
Besides, it's my job to worry, not yours.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.411
Eat your Chow Fun.

16:02.496 --> 16:03.712
If you say so.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.052
What?

16:12.506 --> 16:13.672
You're a good kid.

16:16.844 --> 16:18.093
I'm proud of you.

16:20.848 --> 16:21.763
Thanks.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.567
I'm proud of you, too.

16:28.939 --> 16:30.022
And you know what?

16:30.107 --> 16:31.857
I think we do all right on our own.

16:31.909 --> 16:34.192
Last thing we need is
another cop around here.

16:35.946 --> 16:37.246
You're right.

16:37.331 --> 16:38.697
That's the last thing we need.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.750
Hey, all right, you know what?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.619
Let me see what you were doing.

16:43.704 --> 16:45.587
- How many swipes did I get?
- How tall do you want to be?

16:45.673 --> 16:47.456
Come on, six-five, at least.

16:47.541 --> 16:48.707
- Six-five?
- Yeah.

16:48.792 --> 16:50.042
Hung?

16:50.094 --> 16:51.877
Okay, so you're always
hungry, you're always tired

16:51.929 --> 16:54.296
and you're basically at the
mercy of everyone around you.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.597
It sounds like raising children.

16:55.683 --> 16:56.882
Exactly.

16:56.934 --> 16:58.350
You know what, almost
everyone there comes from

16:58.385 --> 16:59.718
some kind of troubled background.

16:59.803 --> 17:01.637
You realize that bad
stuff happens to everyone,

17:01.722 --> 17:04.439
but they train you to
get your crap together

17:04.525 --> 17:06.141
and stop whining and grow up.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.560
That's pretty amazing, knowing
that you can overcome it.

17:08.646 --> 17:09.895
Well, here's to you, Crash.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.313
You've come a long way,

17:11.397 --> 17:12.781
and I think I speak for everyone when I say

17:12.866 --> 17:14.566
- we are proud of you.
- Cheers.

17:14.652 --> 17:16.068
Congratulations.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.569
Cheers.

17:20.074 --> 17:21.573
I'd like to make a toast, too.

17:26.997 --> 17:28.630
To Taylor.

17:28.716 --> 17:30.382
This year has been one of change,

17:30.417 --> 17:31.883
and at times, a lot of difficulty,

17:31.919 --> 17:33.752
but through all that, you've persevered

17:33.804 --> 17:36.922
and earned straight "A"s and
now you've got this SAT score

17:36.974 --> 17:40.475
and I think that is something
to be admired and honored.

17:40.561 --> 17:42.260
I'm pleased but not surprised.

17:44.848 --> 17:45.814
I love you, Taylor.

17:47.768 --> 17:49.267
I can't do this.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.770
- Honey.
- No, Mom, it's fine.

17:51.855 --> 17:53.188
I got it.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.912
Would you like to fill
me in on what's going on?

18:00.948 --> 18:02.331
Oh, it's nothing.

18:05.085 --> 18:06.451
Taylor... Taylor, I'm sorry.

18:06.503 --> 18:07.619
I didn't mean to freak
you out with the toast.

18:07.705 --> 18:08.954
- Tell me how it happened.
- What?

18:09.039 --> 18:10.622
Who kissed who first, you or Carter?

18:10.674 --> 18:12.457
- No, Taylor, we're not going there.
- Max, please.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.626
Anything would be better than
what's in my head right now.

18:16.130 --> 18:18.463
I am sorry that that's
what's stuck in your head.

18:19.717 --> 18:21.600
If I could make it stop,
I would, you know that.

18:21.635 --> 18:23.352
How'd her necklace come off?

18:24.605 --> 18:25.971
I'm not talking to you about this.

18:26.023 --> 18:27.806
I'm not gonna hurt you
anymore than I already have.

18:27.891 --> 18:29.524
This is the only way

18:29.610 --> 18:31.059
that I will move past this.

18:31.145 --> 18:32.227
I need to know.

18:33.447 --> 18:35.864
Taylor, my best friend was really hurting

18:35.949 --> 18:37.449
and she and I did something

18:37.484 --> 18:41.486
that we used to do whenever
life got messed up, okay?

18:41.572 --> 18:44.072
It's a leftover from a long time ago

18:44.158 --> 18:45.874
when everything was
different for the both of us.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.660
But you gotta believe me, hurting you

18:48.712 --> 18:50.545
is the last thing that I ever wanted to do.

18:52.800 --> 18:53.749
Well, you did.

18:55.052 --> 18:57.386
You could try to remember
how much I love you.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.088
Everything we had.

19:00.174 --> 19:01.556
Things are messed up right now,

19:01.642 --> 19:04.059
I'll give you that, but
that is not all there is.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.261
It's not everything
about us, and you know it.

19:07.848 --> 19:09.231
I need a minute.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.184
I'll see you back at the table.

19:41.799 --> 19:42.714
Crash?

19:44.768 --> 19:45.767
Yeah?

19:49.440 --> 19:50.889
I think there's something you should know.

19:53.861 --> 19:55.727
Is your napkin on your lap?

19:55.813 --> 19:57.195
Doesn't need to be.

19:57.231 --> 19:58.697
No, it's all crumpled up, that's why.

19:58.732 --> 20:00.649
No, you put it on your lap.

20:00.734 --> 20:01.733
Hey.

20:01.819 --> 20:02.651
Hey.

20:02.736 --> 20:04.536
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.455
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

20:11.912 --> 20:13.128
You okay?

20:13.213 --> 20:14.880
Yeah, sure.

20:14.915 --> 20:17.048
Hey, Crash, here comes
the best part... dessert.

20:17.084 --> 20:19.251
No, man, I don't think
I can eat another bite.

20:19.336 --> 20:20.252
Come on, it's tiramisu.

20:20.304 --> 20:21.753
It's made with brandy

20:21.805 --> 20:24.506
and it's the only time I can
have liquor and it's legal.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.347
How'd it go with Hillary?

20:32.432 --> 20:35.400
I called and left a message
saying, "We need to talk."

20:35.435 --> 20:37.152
And 30 seconds later, she texted back

20:37.237 --> 20:38.770
saying, "Are we breaking up?"

20:40.073 --> 20:42.107
- What'd you do?
- I didn't know what to do.

20:42.159 --> 20:43.775
I texted back, "Call me,"

20:43.861 --> 20:48.697
and she texted back, "O-M-G, G-T-H."

20:50.751 --> 20:52.334
Go to hell.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.002
I know.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.338
I wouldn't say it's so
much of an age difference

20:56.423 --> 20:57.706
is the big problem,

20:57.791 --> 21:01.259
it's more like an entire
cultural revolution.

21:01.295 --> 21:03.678
How did you even know what it was?

21:03.764 --> 21:05.430
- Looked it up.
- Right.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.382
On the, um...

21:07.467 --> 21:08.717
Interweb?

21:10.304 --> 21:11.520
Exactly.

21:13.724 --> 21:15.524
- I like this.
- Yeah, you like what?

21:15.609 --> 21:17.309
Us, brushing our teeth.

21:17.394 --> 21:19.895
Yeah, like an old married couple.

21:19.980 --> 21:21.279
Like us.

21:21.315 --> 21:22.480
The good us.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.700
The us I've missed.

21:31.074 --> 21:32.157
What?

21:32.242 --> 21:34.159
I don't know.

21:34.244 --> 21:36.161
I'm... nervous.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.133
You're beautiful.

22:02.322 --> 22:04.239
Can we please talk about this?

22:04.324 --> 22:05.740
Yeah, sure, why don't you start?

22:05.826 --> 22:07.359
What did Taylor tell you?

22:07.411 --> 22:08.610
She told me what I assume

22:08.695 --> 22:10.161
you weren't going to tell me.

22:10.197 --> 22:11.696
That you and Max hooked up.

22:11.782 --> 22:13.415
Okay, Crash, I was going to tell you,

22:13.500 --> 22:15.166
that's why I wanted to
speak to you after dinner.

22:15.202 --> 22:16.201
Okay.

22:17.871 --> 22:20.505
Did she tell you Lori
tried to kill herself?

22:20.540 --> 22:21.623
No.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.008
About a week ago, her doctor called me

22:23.043 --> 22:24.843
and asked me to come
visit her in the hospital,

22:24.878 --> 22:27.462
which I did, and Max came with me.

22:27.547 --> 22:28.930
And that's when it happened?

22:32.019 --> 22:34.135
She told me that she

22:34.221 --> 22:35.687
never wanted to see me again

22:35.722 --> 22:38.556
and that my entire
childhood had been a mistake

22:38.642 --> 22:41.142
and I just lost it.

22:44.031 --> 22:46.564
I don't even know why I
didn't think I cared anymore.

22:48.869 --> 22:50.952
But I wasn't thinking straight.

22:51.038 --> 22:52.570
I couldn't talk.

22:52.623 --> 22:54.072
I just...

22:56.710 --> 22:58.126
I don't know, he was just there.

23:00.464 --> 23:03.331
And I know that's not an excuse...

23:03.417 --> 23:04.749
in any way.

23:07.304 --> 23:10.171
But I promise you it didn't mean anything.

23:10.257 --> 23:12.090
Crash, I was out of my mind.

23:14.094 --> 23:15.644
Please believe me.

23:20.484 --> 23:21.650
I do.

23:24.104 --> 23:25.570
Would you tell your parents thank you

23:25.605 --> 23:27.605
for dinner again, for me?

23:28.775 --> 23:30.241
Crash, I don't want to end our first

23:30.277 --> 23:31.576
night together like this.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.028
Please tell me we can work this out.

23:33.113 --> 23:36.531
I just need a little time to...

23:36.616 --> 23:38.416
think, okay?

23:38.452 --> 23:39.951
We'll talk tomorrow.

23:40.037 --> 23:41.419
Yeah.

23:41.455 --> 23:42.871
- You promise?
- I promise.

23:44.174 --> 23:45.590
Okay.

23:57.471 --> 23:58.853
I was gonna tell him, Taylor.

24:00.724 --> 24:01.973
Too late.

24:05.979 --> 24:07.645
Did it make you feel any better?

24:07.731 --> 24:09.280
A little, yeah.

24:09.316 --> 24:10.648
Okay.

24:27.250 --> 24:28.717
Ah...

24:33.340 --> 24:34.839
How was dinner?

24:34.891 --> 24:36.257
It's not the best Italian in town,

24:36.343 --> 24:38.510
but I guess it's good when
you're eating family style.

24:38.595 --> 24:39.677
How long have you been following me?

24:39.730 --> 24:40.762
Oh, you knew I was gonna find you.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.097
Why'd you even bother running?

24:42.182 --> 24:43.681
What else was I supposed to do, man?

24:43.767 --> 24:46.351
Talk to me, not talk to
your girlfriend's cop mom.

24:46.403 --> 24:48.353
Look, I'm not interested in
you or anything you're doing.

24:48.438 --> 24:49.604
My mouth is shut.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.106
All I care about is getting back to base.

24:51.191 --> 24:52.690
As far as I'm concerned, you don't exist.

24:52.743 --> 24:54.576
Too bad I can't say the same thing for you.

24:57.364 --> 25:00.031
You're my sister's kid,
so I'm not gonna kill you,

25:00.117 --> 25:01.583
but I can't send you back to the army.

25:01.668 --> 25:02.867
Going AWOL, kid.

25:05.005 --> 25:06.621
If they catch me, I'll go to jail.

25:06.706 --> 25:09.124
If they catch us, we'll go to jail.

25:10.794 --> 25:12.043
Family style.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.432
- I need to see Carter.
- No, no way.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.100
You're not seeing her ever again.

25:37.066 --> 25:38.899
- Crash?
- Hey.

25:38.984 --> 25:41.618
- Are you still mad at me?
- Look, Carter, I gotta take off.

25:41.704 --> 25:43.203
- I wanted you to know.
- What?

25:43.238 --> 25:45.038
- Why?
- I borrowed my buddy's car

25:45.074 --> 25:47.240
- and I got to get it back to base.
- But you said we had three days.

25:47.292 --> 25:48.542
You promised we could talk.

25:48.577 --> 25:49.876
Well, things have changed.

25:49.912 --> 25:51.745
Crash, I told you it didn't mean anything.

25:51.797 --> 25:54.131
Look, I gotta go... I'm sorry.

25:54.216 --> 25:55.749
Okay, well, then let me
come back to base with you.

25:55.801 --> 25:58.251
I'll get a bus home or something.

25:58.303 --> 25:59.586
I'll figure it out, I just wanna...

26:02.925 --> 26:04.091
Don't take it personally,

26:04.176 --> 26:05.258
just don't want her looking for you.

26:05.344 --> 26:06.393
You got your little phone call.

26:06.428 --> 26:07.644
We gotta get on the road.

26:09.181 --> 26:11.014
Come on.

26:11.100 --> 26:12.516
Don't push me, man.

26:25.531 --> 26:27.197
Hey, you've reached Crash, leave a message.

26:31.336 --> 26:32.702
What's the hurry?

26:32.788 --> 26:35.288
Crash is leaving, maybe for good.

26:40.045 --> 26:41.211
Hey.

26:41.296 --> 26:42.796
- Did... did Carter just leave?
- Yeah.

26:42.881 --> 26:44.514
- When is she coming home?
- No idea.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.383
Sweetheart, what's going on with you two?

26:46.468 --> 26:48.185
I saw it last night,
I'm seeing it right now.

26:48.270 --> 26:49.469
Nothing, we're fine.

26:49.555 --> 26:51.471
- Thanks.
- What's up with you guys?

26:51.557 --> 26:53.273
We wanted to talk to all
of you at the same time.

26:53.308 --> 26:54.724
Well, Carter's gone

26:54.810 --> 26:57.861
and Grant's at Charlie's, so... what?

26:57.946 --> 27:00.230
- Why are you smiling like that?
- All right.

27:00.315 --> 27:01.982
Well, we're gonna tell you.

27:02.034 --> 27:04.367
Uh, we're getting back together.

27:05.988 --> 27:07.154
What?

27:07.206 --> 27:10.490
Wait... no divorce, no separation?

27:10.542 --> 27:12.626
No, honey, the whole thing's off.

27:12.661 --> 27:14.544
Well, what about Kyle and Hillary?

27:14.630 --> 27:16.496
- No, that's over.
- Done.

27:16.548 --> 27:19.216
Listen, we realize that we've
put you through a lot these

27:19.301 --> 27:21.501
past couple of months and we are so sorry.

27:21.553 --> 27:22.836
No parent wants to work out their

27:22.888 --> 27:24.671
marital stuff in front of their kids.

27:24.756 --> 27:27.174
Your father and I, we
realized how much we have

27:27.226 --> 27:28.391
and how much we've been through.

27:28.477 --> 27:29.676
- It's a lot.
- It is.

27:30.896 --> 27:32.596
And we don't want to throw it away.

27:38.103 --> 27:39.653
Hi, excuse me, I'm, uh...

27:39.688 --> 27:40.854
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

27:40.906 --> 27:42.405
He's a tall, blonde army guy.

27:42.491 --> 27:43.857
- Checked in yesterday.
- Yeah, yeah, the soldier.

27:43.942 --> 27:45.659
Yeah, do you know what room number he's in?

27:45.694 --> 27:47.694
I... he's gone.

27:47.746 --> 27:50.163
- But his car's still outside.
- He left with two men.

27:50.199 --> 27:51.331
- What, army guys?
- Army?

27:51.366 --> 27:52.949
I mean, I don't think so.

27:53.035 --> 27:55.252
- I mean, I don't know.
- What did they look like, the guys?

27:55.337 --> 27:58.705
Well, one was big, tattoos on his neck.

27:58.790 --> 28:00.290
The other was smaller,

28:00.375 --> 28:02.209
good looking, short blonde hair.

28:02.261 --> 28:03.710
They had an argument and they left.

28:11.220 --> 28:12.102
Hey.

28:12.187 --> 28:13.603
Hey.

28:13.689 --> 28:16.389
Uh, thanks for coming by.

28:17.693 --> 28:19.559
Do you want a drink or something?

28:19.645 --> 28:22.279
No, no, no, no, I'm good, thanks.

28:33.792 --> 28:35.659
So my parents aren't breaking up.

28:35.744 --> 28:37.244
- That's incredible.
- Yeah.

28:37.296 --> 28:39.796
They lied and cheated.

28:39.882 --> 28:41.798
Let each other down over and over again.

28:41.884 --> 28:43.133
I don't get it.

28:43.218 --> 28:45.502
How can they move on after
everything that they've done?

28:45.587 --> 28:46.920
They love each other.

28:49.758 --> 28:52.642
Max, I did something really mean

28:52.728 --> 28:54.928
that I feel really, really horrible about.

28:55.013 --> 28:56.479
What?

28:58.600 --> 29:00.267
I told Crash what happened.

29:02.070 --> 29:04.104
Before Carter could.

29:09.111 --> 29:10.527
How did he take that?

29:10.612 --> 29:11.995
Not very well, I think.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.330
Carter went to talk to him.

29:13.415 --> 29:14.948
I hope that they can work it out.

29:17.035 --> 29:18.368
Me too.

29:19.621 --> 29:21.621
Because I feel worse now than I did before.

29:24.626 --> 29:26.426
No, people mess up.

29:26.461 --> 29:28.345
You were hurt and you lashed out.

29:29.965 --> 29:31.181
That happens.

29:31.266 --> 29:33.466
I'm learning... how to forgive.

29:35.938 --> 29:37.637
But...

29:37.689 --> 29:39.556
- it's hard.
- I know.

29:39.641 --> 29:42.559
Giving up on people...

29:42.644 --> 29:43.810
doesn't change anything.

29:43.895 --> 29:45.645
It doesn't make them better people.

29:49.484 --> 29:51.484
So don't give up on me, okay?

30:29.858 --> 30:31.741
Mom, I can't find Crash.

30:33.195 --> 30:34.911
I don't know, I think something happened.

30:37.833 --> 30:39.582
I think Shay had something to do with it.

30:45.311 --> 30:46.310
Hey.

30:46.396 --> 30:47.528
Oh, hey, Mom.

30:47.614 --> 30:48.813
We're gonna find him.

30:48.898 --> 30:50.281
Okay, I, um...

30:50.316 --> 30:51.949
There is a security
camera in the parking lot.

30:51.985 --> 30:53.150
I got the manager to set things up

30:53.203 --> 30:54.485
so you can watch it in there

30:54.571 --> 30:55.703
and I told him not to
touch anything in the room

30:55.788 --> 30:56.871
in the meantime.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.239
You might have been disappointed with your

30:58.324 --> 31:00.491
SAT scores, but your cop skills, not bad.

31:01.995 --> 31:03.995
Mom?

31:04.047 --> 31:06.047
Do you think you're
gonna be able to find him.

31:06.132 --> 31:07.164
We're gonna try.

31:07.217 --> 31:09.000
Noel?

31:09.068 --> 31:11.752
- Can you bring her home, please?
- What? No, I'm not gonna leave.

31:11.838 --> 31:13.170
- You have to.
- Mom.

31:13.223 --> 31:15.640
As soon as I find him,
I will bring him home.

31:15.675 --> 31:17.675
Listen, you've got to let me do my work.

31:19.229 --> 31:20.561
I think we got something.

31:29.856 --> 31:31.522
Your mom just called.

31:31.608 --> 31:33.190
You want to sit and wait with us?

31:33.276 --> 31:34.859
Uh, yeah.

31:36.696 --> 31:38.529
- I'm going crazy.
- I know, it's hard.

31:38.615 --> 31:40.197
The love of my life is out there, too,

31:40.250 --> 31:42.867
but all we can do is wait and trust.

31:42.952 --> 31:44.168
"The love of your life"?

31:44.203 --> 31:45.703
You missed it, they're back together.

31:47.790 --> 31:48.873
Really?

31:48.925 --> 31:50.791
It'll be a new beginning for us.

31:50.877 --> 31:51.876
All of us.

31:54.631 --> 31:55.713
Will it?

31:57.717 --> 31:59.467
Okay, okay, hold on, hold on.

31:59.552 --> 32:01.552
- Can you rewind it, please?
- Yeah.

32:02.889 --> 32:04.105
Yes... okay.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.607
That's them walking out,
but I can't see the car.

32:06.693 --> 32:08.643
Well, there's... there's
another camera on the other side.

32:08.728 --> 32:11.479
- Yeah, will you go to it, please?
- There, there.

32:11.564 --> 32:14.231
That's... that's what the... the
car they drove up in, I think.

32:14.284 --> 32:16.901
- I'll call it in.
- Just rewind it a little bit further.

32:18.738 --> 32:20.404
You're gonna have to
give me a copy of this.

32:20.456 --> 32:25.042
I need a trace, Victor,
Bravo, Frank, 4-1-4-0, Indy.

32:25.078 --> 32:25.993
Copy.

32:26.079 --> 32:27.328
We got it.

32:27.413 --> 32:28.746
- Reported stolen three nights ago.
- Great.

32:28.798 --> 32:30.998
- Thank you for your help.
- Yeah.

32:32.468 --> 32:33.801
All units, I need an APB.

32:33.886 --> 32:35.753
for a red Mazda, Maryland plates,

32:35.805 --> 32:37.888
Victor, Bravo, Frank, 41-40.

32:37.924 --> 32:40.424
We're looking for three
white males, one early 20s,

32:40.476 --> 32:41.759
two early 30s.

32:41.811 --> 32:43.511
Assume that they're armed and dangerous.

32:50.269 --> 32:51.936
Yes.

32:52.021 --> 32:53.154
Yes, what?

32:53.239 --> 32:54.605
Yes, to the new beginning thing.

33:03.166 --> 33:05.082
- I'm really sorry.
- What for?

33:05.118 --> 33:07.585
Well, if I hadn't have told
Crash about you and Max,

33:07.620 --> 33:09.787
maybe he wouldn't have gone to the motel.

33:09.872 --> 33:11.622
No, Taylor, don't be ridiculous.

33:11.708 --> 33:13.758
They were following him, they
would have found him anyway.

33:13.793 --> 33:15.376
Okay, well, I'm still sorry.

33:15.461 --> 33:18.379
I thought it would somehow even the score,

33:18.464 --> 33:19.764
but it didn't.

33:19.799 --> 33:22.633
Look, Taylor, you have
every right to be angry.

33:22.719 --> 33:24.468
It's just human instinct to lash out

33:24.554 --> 33:25.686
when someone hurts you.

33:25.772 --> 33:27.888
I've done it tons of times.

33:27.974 --> 33:30.725
It's also human to

33:30.810 --> 33:34.145
seek comfort when you're in trouble.

33:34.197 --> 33:35.312
People can hurt each other,

33:35.398 --> 33:37.732
but they can still love each other.

33:37.817 --> 33:39.033
Think about Mom and Dad.

33:42.155 --> 33:44.655
To new beginnings.

33:46.209 --> 33:47.491
To new beginnings.

33:57.220 --> 33:58.969
How are you?

33:59.005 --> 34:00.471
I'm fine.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.723
I requested a transfer this morning.

34:02.809 --> 34:04.508
- Where?
- I don't know yet.

34:08.147 --> 34:10.264
Listen, Kyle, I know
that you're angry with me,

34:10.349 --> 34:12.183
but I am hoping one day

34:12.268 --> 34:14.068
- that we'll be able to be friends.
- We're not gonna be friends, Liz.

34:14.152 --> 34:15.603
I told you from the beginning,

34:15.688 --> 34:17.154
- I didn't know where my head was.
- Oh, come on.

34:17.190 --> 34:19.489
Let's just be honest here...
you used that as an excuse.

34:19.525 --> 34:21.692
You were scared and you
didn't wanna face being alone,

34:21.744 --> 34:23.777
so you leaned on me,
and that's what happened,

34:23.862 --> 34:25.329
and honestly, it's not my job

34:25.364 --> 34:27.031
to make you feel better about it anymore.

34:29.534 --> 34:31.869
I can't be your friend, Liz.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.536
I'm still in love with you.

34:35.958 --> 34:38.175
I always will be.

34:43.766 --> 34:45.382
Detective Wilson.

34:45.435 --> 34:46.467
Okay, I got it.

34:46.552 --> 34:47.935
We're on our way.

34:48.020 --> 34:49.770
A dealer downtown just ran Shay's plate.

34:49.856 --> 34:51.554
He's trying to switch out the stolen car.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.116
Three guys, no visible weapons,

35:02.201 --> 35:04.652
- they're keeping Crash close.
- All units, we're gonna need backup.

35:04.737 --> 35:06.737
You go wide, I go tight against the fence.

35:06.789 --> 35:08.906
- Let's make sure Crash is okay.
- Copy that.

35:31.848 --> 35:33.230
Silver caddy's us.

35:33.266 --> 35:34.348
- Freeze!
- Police!

35:34.433 --> 35:35.850
- Freeze!
- Let me see your hands!

35:35.935 --> 35:36.901
- Freeze!
- Let me see your hands up!

35:36.936 --> 35:38.519
Get down on the ground!

35:38.604 --> 35:40.771
- Okay, stay cool, we're good.
- Get down on the ground now!

35:40.857 --> 35:42.523
- We have nothing on us!
- Now!

35:42.608 --> 35:43.908
Crash, over there!

35:43.943 --> 35:45.109
Get down now!

35:46.362 --> 35:48.112
I've got him!

35:48.164 --> 35:49.163
Hold it!

36:00.293 --> 36:02.009
Shots fired, shots
fired, send me some units.

36:03.296 --> 36:04.211
Drop your weapon!

36:16.225 --> 36:17.141
Drop your weapon!

36:19.862 --> 36:20.811
Hold it!

36:35.878 --> 36:37.044
Drop your weapon!

36:40.082 --> 36:41.248
Crash, step away!

36:41.334 --> 36:42.383
Step aside!

36:42.468 --> 36:43.667
Step back!

36:46.088 --> 36:47.087
Sorry, Detective.

36:48.841 --> 36:49.640
No!

36:49.675 --> 36:51.225
Kyle!

36:58.818 --> 37:00.184
- You okay, partner?
- It's gone off.

37:00.269 --> 37:02.019
- What?
- I think his gun went off.

37:03.656 --> 37:05.155
It's all right, you're gonna be okay.

37:05.191 --> 37:08.075
Officer down, officer
down, all units respond.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.193
Crash!

37:09.278 --> 37:10.494
It's okay, let's get this off.

37:10.529 --> 37:11.862
Crash!

37:11.914 --> 37:14.081
I have a medical kit
in my car... get it now!

37:14.166 --> 37:16.166
- Let's get this off.
- Is it bad, is it bad?

37:20.604 --> 37:20.902
Let's get this off, let's get this off.

37:22.322 --> 37:24.356
I need medical now!

37:24.441 --> 37:25.941
You're gonna be fine.

37:26.026 --> 37:27.609
We're gonna stop the
bleeding, you'll be fine.

37:27.694 --> 37:29.861
Ambulance is on the way, okay.

37:29.947 --> 37:31.363
Apply pressure... get in here.

37:31.448 --> 37:33.248
- Celox and QuikClot in here.
- Yeah.

37:33.333 --> 37:35.534
- Give me some gauze.
- Can you move your legs at all?

37:35.586 --> 37:37.335
All right, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

37:37.371 --> 37:38.870
It's okay, its okay.

37:38.922 --> 37:40.789
- Stay with me.
- All right, the ambulance is almost here.

37:40.874 --> 37:42.207
Can you talk 'til they get here?

37:42.259 --> 37:44.843
- My leg, my leg...
- It's okay, you're in shock.

37:44.878 --> 37:47.596
You're in shock right
now, don't worry about it.

37:47.681 --> 37:49.598
Keep talking now, keep
talking to me, come on!

37:52.102 --> 37:53.268
Get in here!

37:53.353 --> 37:54.770
I have one here, one in back.

37:54.855 --> 37:57.389
- Cuff him!
- Ambulance is here, I'm gonna flag them down.

37:57.474 --> 37:59.558
Hey, you're gonna be just fine.

37:59.610 --> 38:00.609
You're gonna be fine.

38:02.729 --> 38:04.396
If this is your way of
getting my attention,

38:04.481 --> 38:05.814
you got it, partner.

38:05.899 --> 38:07.949
Just so you stay with me.

38:08.035 --> 38:10.485
Don't leave me, okay, partner?

38:10.571 --> 38:12.454
I need some help!

38:21.832 --> 38:23.582
I need some help!

38:26.637 --> 38:29.254
Look at me, look at me, look at me.

38:30.641 --> 38:31.756
Okay, hang on.

38:31.842 --> 38:33.642
- They got Shay.
- Oh, thank God.

38:33.727 --> 38:35.427
And Crash is on his way here.

38:35.512 --> 38:37.179
Oh my God.

38:37.264 --> 38:38.480
How's Mom?

38:38.565 --> 38:39.931
Mom's fine.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.018
Mom?

38:43.103 --> 38:44.019
Hi.

38:44.104 --> 38:45.237
Are you okay?

38:45.272 --> 38:46.404
Okay, good.

38:46.440 --> 38:47.572
I love you.

38:47.608 --> 38:48.607
I love you.

38:48.692 --> 38:49.941
Okay, here's Carter.

38:49.993 --> 38:51.493
Mom?

38:51.578 --> 38:53.411
How's Crash?

38:53.447 --> 38:55.030
Okay.

38:55.115 --> 38:56.281
Thank you.

38:58.752 --> 39:00.118
My mom says if it wasn't for you,

39:00.170 --> 39:02.454
Kyle wouldn't have even made it to surgery.

39:02.506 --> 39:04.039
I was just doing what they taught me.

39:06.126 --> 39:07.175
Are you okay?

39:08.512 --> 39:09.711
I'm fine.

39:12.099 --> 39:13.682
Crash, I'm sorry for what happened

39:13.767 --> 39:14.683
between me and Max.

39:14.768 --> 39:15.884
You already said that.

39:18.472 --> 39:19.688
I believe you.

39:21.642 --> 39:22.807
Okay.

39:24.811 --> 39:26.728
The base is only three
hours away from here.

39:26.813 --> 39:29.030
I was thinking you could
drive down on weekends.

39:31.318 --> 39:33.702
- What?
- Or I could come here.

39:33.787 --> 39:35.704
And we can...

39:35.789 --> 39:38.206
Skype, FaceTime, text,

39:38.292 --> 39:40.208
Instagram, Snapchat.

39:42.296 --> 39:44.546
What if you get stationed on
the other side of the world?

39:44.631 --> 39:46.047
I'll deal with that when it happens.

39:48.085 --> 39:49.167
I love you, Carter.

39:54.808 --> 39:56.057
I love you, too.

40:07.521 --> 40:09.020
Can't be easy being married to a cop.

40:12.409 --> 40:14.859
Every time she goes to
work, I spend the whole day

40:14.912 --> 40:16.861
waiting for her to come
back through that door.

40:26.456 --> 40:27.372
Mom?

40:29.710 --> 40:30.625
Hey.

40:30.711 --> 40:32.127
Liz... what?

40:34.097 --> 40:35.714
You should get to the hospital.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.132
Gabe's gonna need you.

40:37.217 --> 40:38.133
Why?

40:39.720 --> 40:40.936
Kyle's dead.
