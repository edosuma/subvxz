00:06.991 --> 00:12.303
Re: the unsolved murder of Gail
Vella on September 10th, 2019.

00:12.303 --> 00:14.292
What was Gail Vella digging into?

00:14.292 --> 00:16.591
Was it something that got
her killed?

00:16.591 --> 00:21.455
This programme contains some
strong language

00:21.455 --> 00:24.732
Ah!

00:24.732 --> 00:27.372
This was all crossed wires.
I'm being scapegoated here.

00:27.372 --> 00:29.775
"Scapegoated"?

00:29.775 --> 00:33.871
Charge him.

00:33.871 --> 00:37.007
What's this?We're going to share.

00:37.007 --> 00:41.172
Overcrowding.

00:41.172 --> 00:45.263
You've become unable
to lead your team.

00:45.263 --> 00:46.287
What?

00:46.287 --> 00:49.332
You'll be permitted to
retire with your full pension

00:49.332 --> 00:55.055
and avoid the ignominy of
disciplinary action and dismissal.

00:55.055 --> 01:08.412
Fortunately, there was
John's life insurance.

01:08.412 --> 01:09.647
It's as easy as that, Jo.

01:09.647 --> 01:12.079
I wanted to bring up
the other matter,

01:12.079 --> 01:13.692
my concerns with Ryan.

01:13.692 --> 01:17.135
Drop it, Kate.

01:17.135 --> 01:19.572
I don't know where you're getting
your figures from, but I...

01:19.572 --> 01:22.812
Well, the figures came from
your own office, Chief Constable.

01:22.812 --> 01:27.567
The barefaced liar,
promoted to our highest office!

01:27.567 --> 01:28.812
And what about you,

01:28.812 --> 01:31.663
do you still believe there's
a fourth man out there?

01:31.663 --> 01:50.223
"H"?

01:50.223 --> 01:52.812
The analysis detected
partial matches to a nominal

01:52.812 --> 01:55.343
whose DNA is stored on
other police databases.

01:55.343 --> 01:57.612
There's only one credible
explanation for Jo Davidson's

01:57.612 --> 01:59.823
DNA matching this individual.

01:59.823 --> 02:04.692
They're blood relatives.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.927
A prison officer making
a routine inspection

02:06.927 --> 02:09.372
found Jimmy Lakewell hanging,

02:09.372 --> 02:13.007
cold, not breathing, pulseless.

02:13.007 --> 02:16.655
Unfortunately, there's no CCTV
in here or outside the cell door.

02:16.655 --> 02:18.492
WHISPERS:Christ sake.

02:18.492 --> 02:21.012
It wasn't your fault, sir.

02:21.012 --> 02:23.567
It was Lakewell's decision
to come back to prison.

02:23.567 --> 02:25.935
In the prison van,
he gave me a lead.

02:25.935 --> 02:29.903
Gail Vella was digging
into Lawrence Christopher...

02:29.903 --> 02:33.132
..the death in custody in 2003.

02:33.132 --> 02:40.847
I'll get right on to it, sir.

02:40.847 --> 02:44.687
We've been looking at any possible
links between Gail Vella's murder

02:44.687 --> 02:46.095
and the bookies robbery.

02:46.095 --> 02:48.783
We've established there was a
rendezvous for all the armed robbers

02:48.783 --> 02:50.532
in the middle of the night.

02:50.532 --> 02:53.327
Now, Jake Kilorgan described
an industrial estate,

02:53.327 --> 02:56.532
it's about ten to 15 minutes' drive
from his address in Moss Heath.

02:56.532 --> 02:58.383
The location had metal gates,

02:58.383 --> 03:07.279
there's a short road servicing
five to six industrial units.

03:07.279 --> 03:10.223
Industrial sites
in a 15-minute radius.

03:10.223 --> 03:12.207
Doesn't look like too many.

03:12.207 --> 03:15.252
Just the first batch, ma'am,
the ones we could find online.

03:15.252 --> 03:18.415
The chances are the OCG are
using somewhere more covert,

03:18.415 --> 03:20.052
so the team's
studying street images

03:20.052 --> 03:21.871
and then they'll
recce the best matches.

03:21.871 --> 03:24.303
OK. Keep me updated.Ma'am.

03:24.303 --> 03:26.223
Boss, have you got a minute?

03:26.223 --> 03:31.983
Sorry, Kate, not now.

03:31.983 --> 03:34.735
DSU Davidson travelled
by car from the Hill,

03:34.735 --> 03:38.575
arriving at her home address
at 20:17 this evening.Right.

03:38.575 --> 03:40.367
Steve.

03:40.367 --> 03:41.711
Thank you for coming, Kate.

03:41.711 --> 03:44.719
This is by far the safest
location for you right now.

03:44.719 --> 03:46.063
Understood, sir.

03:46.063 --> 03:49.903
Did the SFC authorise you
to carry a concealed firearm?

03:49.903 --> 03:51.132
Good.

03:51.132 --> 03:53.551
Given what we've learned
about Ryan Pilkington,

03:53.551 --> 03:55.663
you have to look after yourself.

03:55.663 --> 04:01.487
So, what's happening on the Hill?

04:01.487 --> 04:02.772
Frankly, sir, I don't know.

04:02.772 --> 04:05.172
Jo's become cold
and distant towards me.

04:05.172 --> 04:08.591
I don't know what's
going on in the background.

04:08.591 --> 04:11.343
Carry on, Chloe.

04:11.343 --> 04:13.692
The surveillance team report

04:13.692 --> 04:17.743
they're unable to observe
activity from within the property.

04:17.743 --> 04:20.815
You've put Jo under surveillance?
Why?

04:20.815 --> 04:23.412
Yeah, well, this is why we've
called you in today, Kate.

04:23.412 --> 04:26.895
We've examined DSU Davidson's
family history.

04:26.895 --> 04:30.612
Her personnel file gives next
of kin as Samantha Davidson.

04:30.612 --> 04:34.383
However, we've discovered
Samantha Davidson is deceased.

04:34.383 --> 04:37.007
Our in-depth forensic
examination of Farida Jatri's home

04:37.007 --> 04:41.772
detected Davidson's DNA.

04:41.772 --> 04:47.183
Davidson's DNA's a partial
match for Tommy Hunter.

04:47.183 --> 04:48.975
That's not the worst of it.

04:48.975 --> 04:54.671
There's an unusually high percentage
 match and runs of homozygosity.

04:54.671 --> 04:56.052
Oh, my God.

04:56.052 --> 04:57.743
I know from Steve that
you've formed a view

04:57.743 --> 05:00.175
that Davidson isn't bent, Kate.

05:00.175 --> 05:37.572
But I'm sorry, it appears that she's
pulled the wool over your eyes.

05:37.572 --> 05:52.335
FAINT NEWSCAST PLAYS

05:52.335 --> 05:54.852
Yeah?

05:54.852 --> 06:00.527
Sir, we thought you'd want to
see what's on the TV.Oh, right.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.743
TV:For too long now,

06:01.743 --> 06:08.532
police officers have had to serve
faceless, unaccountable bureaucrats.

06:08.532 --> 06:11.791
We've even had to suffer
political opportunists

06:11.791 --> 06:14.671
trying to win votes by
vilifying police officers

06:14.671 --> 06:18.575
with false
allegations of corruption.

06:18.575 --> 06:24.335
My duty, and the duty of every one
of my officers, is very clear.

06:24.335 --> 06:28.815
We serve the public,
not politicians,

06:28.815 --> 06:32.847
and it is high time
we took back control.

06:32.847 --> 06:36.047
Policing should be left
to those who know best,

06:36.047 --> 06:38.095
police officers.

06:38.095 --> 06:39.972
Thank you.

06:39.972 --> 06:58.212
Right, everybody back to work.
Come on.

06:58.212 --> 07:01.263
Thank you, Charlotte.

07:01.263 --> 07:02.927
Good of you to see me, sir.

07:02.927 --> 07:04.692
No need to call me "sir" any more.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.895
The Chief's thrown me under a bus.

07:06.895 --> 07:08.943
Do nothing, I'm weakened.

07:08.943 --> 07:12.207
Fire him, I lose the support
of rank-and-file officers.

07:12.207 --> 07:14.831
I'm resigning.

07:14.831 --> 07:17.071
But why is the Chief doing this?

07:17.071 --> 07:21.372
I'd been fighting his
plan to scale back AC-12.

07:21.372 --> 07:23.023
Frankly, it's not been easy.

07:23.023 --> 07:25.212
You've been a bull in a china shop.

07:25.212 --> 07:28.692
I appreciate that, sir,
but you know me.

07:28.692 --> 07:32.652
If I see a bent copper, I only know
one way and that's full throttle.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.735
So prove it.

07:34.735 --> 07:41.172
It's down to you now, Ted,
in whatever time you've got left.

07:41.172 --> 07:59.567
Sir.

07:59.567 --> 09:12.015
Sir.Cheers, Fletch.

09:12.015 --> 09:13.743
Mate, I've nothing new.

09:13.743 --> 09:16.367
Every time we get close,
we get knocked back.

09:16.367 --> 09:18.031
Well, not entirely.

09:18.031 --> 09:19.503
Lakewell feared for his life.

09:19.503 --> 09:21.615
In transit, he agreed to
reveal some of what he knew,

09:21.615 --> 09:23.855
knowing it could never be
attributed to him in court.

09:23.855 --> 09:26.479
The case Gail Vella was
researching at the time of her death

09:26.479 --> 09:29.295
was the murder of
Lawrence Christopher.

09:29.295 --> 09:31.812
That was, what, 20 years ago?17.

09:31.812 --> 09:34.452
Is that what your text was about?

09:34.452 --> 09:37.487
No, something else.

09:37.487 --> 09:39.919
I carried out an unlawful search.

09:39.919 --> 09:45.807
You'll understand why.

09:45.807 --> 09:48.623
A banknote recovered from a
private residential property,

09:48.623 --> 09:49.967
part of a much larger sum,

09:49.967 --> 09:54.132
easily tens of thousands of pounds.

09:54.132 --> 09:57.583
And this property?

09:57.583 --> 10:00.015
Merseyside.

10:00.015 --> 10:01.423
Steph Corbett.

10:01.423 --> 10:03.252
I checked her financial records.

10:03.252 --> 10:05.327
There's no legit
source for the money.

10:05.327 --> 10:07.092
So, where's it come from?

10:07.092 --> 10:09.972
Forensic analysis
gives a 99.9% probability

10:09.972 --> 10:13.391
the banknote comes from the same
batch as Â£50,000 found last year

10:13.391 --> 10:15.759
in a bedroom of the Edge Park Hotel.

10:15.759 --> 10:18.012
The 50 grand the Gaffer
was duped into accepting

10:18.012 --> 10:21.012
and intended to return.Ah, shit.

10:21.012 --> 10:22.607
At the time, there was an allegation

10:22.607 --> 10:24.372
the true amount had
been a 100 grand.

10:24.372 --> 10:27.023
The allegation was dismissed
given the Gaffer's credibility

10:27.023 --> 10:29.967
and the fact the other
50 couldn't be found.

10:29.967 --> 10:39.375
Until now.

10:39.375 --> 10:42.255
OVER PHONE: Steve, it's me, Steph.

10:42.255 --> 10:45.492
I, uh, haven't heard from
you in a couple of weeks

10:45.492 --> 10:48.975
and I'm just checking to
see if everything's OK.

10:48.975 --> 10:52.495
I know you're busy and that. Sorry.

10:52.495 --> 10:57.295
Call me back.

10:57.295 --> 11:02.351
LINE RINGS

11:02.351 --> 11:04.692
Hiya.

11:04.692 --> 11:09.135
Sorry for rabbiting on,
I hate leaving messages.

11:09.135 --> 11:10.863
No, no.

11:10.863 --> 11:12.527
No, sorry I haven't called.

11:12.527 --> 11:14.319
You OK?Yeah.

11:14.319 --> 11:16.332
You?

11:16.332 --> 11:19.572
Yeah.

11:19.572 --> 11:22.639
This week isn't great for me,
I'm kind of snowed under.

11:22.639 --> 11:26.292
You OK if we leave it?

11:26.292 --> 11:28.335
For this week like, or...

11:28.335 --> 11:30.612
..or leave it leave it?

11:30.612 --> 11:33.852
I just meant this week.

11:33.852 --> 11:38.292
Why, do you want to leave it?

11:38.292 --> 11:42.372
Do you?

11:42.372 --> 11:44.655
Look, Steph, I'm still at work,

11:44.655 --> 11:47.412
I can't really talk right now.

11:47.412 --> 11:52.143
I'll call you when
I get the chance, OK?

11:52.143 --> 11:54.132
OK.

11:54.132 --> 11:56.175
Bye.

11:56.175 --> 13:02.735
Bye.

13:02.735 --> 13:14.412
Steve, it's me.

13:14.412 --> 13:19.247
Boss...

13:19.247 --> 13:23.052
..I think we might have
located the OCG workshop.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.175
That's great.

13:24.175 --> 13:26.351
Look, given the problem
we've had with leaks,

13:26.351 --> 13:28.399
I'd like to brief the
entire team straight away,

13:28.399 --> 13:30.063
with your permission, of course.

13:30.063 --> 13:31.855
Sure.

13:31.855 --> 13:34.415
Thanks, boss.

13:34.415 --> 13:36.372
Right, can everybody
report to the Incident Room

13:36.372 --> 13:54.639
for a briefing, please?

13:54.639 --> 13:58.031
Thank you. DI Fleming.Boss.

13:58.031 --> 14:00.655
I believe I've identified a site
matching the description

14:00.655 --> 14:04.572
given to us by Jake Kilorgan
of the OCG firearms workshop.

14:04.572 --> 14:07.375
Now, as you know, recommissioned
firearms and tailored ammunition

14:07.375 --> 14:11.663
were used in the murder of Gail
Vella and the recent OCG ambush.

14:11.663 --> 14:14.415
The workshop could provide
crucial forensic evidence

14:14.415 --> 14:16.783
in the hunt to find Gail's killer.

14:16.783 --> 14:21.327
The location is Lochside Yard,
an industrial estate in Moss Heath.

14:21.327 --> 14:24.852
We need to move quick and ensure
complete security on comms.

14:24.852 --> 14:27.663
Plus, I'd like all officers
to surrender their phones.

14:27.663 --> 14:29.135
What?What?
THEY HUFF

14:29.135 --> 14:30.543
Come on, ma'am, seriously?

14:30.543 --> 14:33.252
Look, whatever way word got out
on the op to arrest Carl Banks

14:33.252 --> 14:38.351
isn't happening this time.

14:38.351 --> 14:41.935
Phones...

14:41.935 --> 14:51.732
Please do as DI Fleming says.

14:51.732 --> 14:58.332
Bullshit.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.047
Thank you.

15:00.047 --> 15:03.695
We'll need a search warrant,
plus all relevant authorities

15:03.695 --> 15:05.935
for ARVs fully crewed with AFOs.

15:05.935 --> 15:08.111
Deployment roles will
come from DI Fleming.

15:08.111 --> 15:10.223
I'd like to TL within the hour.

15:10.223 --> 15:14.652
Nobody leaves these rooms
except myself and DI Fleming.

15:14.652 --> 15:17.455
Carry on.Boss.Ma'am.

15:17.455 --> 15:20.335
Right, we'll deploy two
ARVs to the white aspect,

15:20.335 --> 15:24.012
no black in play,
plus GPD if required.

15:24.012 --> 15:26.223
Chris, can you
arrange route planning?

15:26.223 --> 15:29.052
We'll also need full
forensic deployment available.

15:29.052 --> 15:31.932
Boss.Ma'am.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.572
Crack on.

15:34.572 --> 15:36.143
What now, Kate?

15:36.143 --> 15:54.255
Boss, there's something
I need to tell you.

18:49.487 --> 18:51.151
We'll move on to the other sites.

18:51.151 --> 18:53.412
What other sites?

18:53.412 --> 18:56.292
Kate informed me three
locations match the criteria,

18:56.292 --> 18:58.255
this was the nearest.

18:58.255 --> 19:00.559
I'm sorry, Chris, but I was
worried about potential leaks,

19:00.559 --> 19:03.972
so I only informed Acting DSU
Davidson of the other two.

19:03.972 --> 19:05.935
Right. God's sake.

19:05.935 --> 19:07.471
It's nothing personal, Sarge.

19:07.471 --> 19:08.815
We'll split the team.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.863
I'll lead the deployment
to White Rock Park,

19:10.863 --> 19:13.487
DI Fleming will lead the
deployment to Knights' Courtyard.

19:13.487 --> 19:16.623

I'm going with the Boss.

22:41.935 --> 22:44.303
Ma'am, we attempted to arrest
two suspects at this site

22:44.303 --> 22:47.055
and, unfortunately, our AFOs
were forced to open fire.

22:47.055 --> 22:48.732
It gets worse.

22:48.732 --> 22:50.895
You still haven't told me
how you came to be here.

22:50.895 --> 22:53.532
We were led to this site by an
AC-12 surveillance operation

22:53.532 --> 22:55.572
of OCG men believed to be
linked to the recent ambush

22:55.572 --> 22:57.039
of a prisoner transport

22:57.039 --> 23:01.967
in which an AC-12
officer lost her life.

23:01.967 --> 23:10.332
Inside the unit, two men,
serious high-velocity GSWs.

23:10.332 --> 23:12.492
No respiration,
nothing's going to help.No.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.255
GSWs with severe haemorrhaging.

23:14.255 --> 23:15.663
We'll start resus and see what...

23:15.663 --> 23:17.071
All right, guys, stand down.

23:17.071 --> 23:21.132
You'll need to surrender yourself
for full forensic recovery.Sir.

23:21.132 --> 23:23.172
This is what we've been looking for.

23:23.172 --> 23:24.623
Yeah, we found it first.

23:24.623 --> 23:27.132
This location's of high
value to MIT's inquiry

23:27.132 --> 23:30.063
into the murder of Gail Vella.
It's ours, DI Arnott.

23:30.063 --> 23:32.532
Ma'am, we need full access
and full sharing of evidence.

23:32.532 --> 23:34.735
You've just ordered
your AFOs to stand down,

23:34.735 --> 23:47.172
I'm ordering you to do the same.

23:47.172 --> 23:49.583
Chris, as soon as the
casualties have been evacuated,

23:49.583 --> 23:52.399
cordon off this unit and bring
in a full forensic deployment.

23:52.399 --> 23:54.852
Ma'am.

23:54.852 --> 23:56.892
Mike India Five three, Control.

23:56.892 --> 24:01.615
State Six, White Rock Park.

24:01.615 --> 24:04.495
No resps, carotid pulse absent.

24:04.495 --> 24:07.247
KATE:MIT carried out a
successful operation.

24:07.247 --> 24:10.255
I was conscious a possible
leak would alert the OCG.

24:10.255 --> 24:12.559
Only one site was
disclosed to MIT officers.

24:12.559 --> 24:15.183
However, I took the decision
to inform DSU Davidson

24:15.183 --> 24:16.812
of all three possible sites.

24:16.812 --> 24:18.191
It's a big call, Kate.

24:18.191 --> 24:19.855
Well, I believe it paid off, sir.

24:19.855 --> 24:22.287
You said yourself the information
on Jo's family history

24:22.287 --> 24:24.975
strongly suggests she's
colluding with organised crime,

24:24.975 --> 24:27.663
but that doesn't fit with
what I've witnessed first-hand.

24:27.663 --> 24:29.652
We needed to know
one way or another.

24:29.652 --> 24:32.532
She had plenty of time to
tip off the OCG and she didn't.

24:32.532 --> 24:36.047
As far as I'm concerned,
that's proof she's not bent.

24:36.047 --> 24:38.095
Look, Davidson led the
deployment to White Rock,

24:38.095 --> 24:40.335
where the workshop just
happened to be located.

24:40.335 --> 24:41.807
Then she ordered me to stand down,

24:41.807 --> 24:44.559
enabling her to take
control of the crime scene.

24:44.559 --> 24:46.332
For all we know,
she played it that way,

24:46.332 --> 24:48.015
to appear straight
while still being able

24:48.015 --> 24:50.063
to manipulate the investigation.

24:50.063 --> 24:51.919
Steve's right, Kate.

24:51.919 --> 24:54.972
In my book, the jury's still out.

24:54.972 --> 24:56.591
Sir.

24:56.591 --> 25:00.252
So, what do we know
about these OCG suspects?

25:00.252 --> 25:02.671
White Rock Park.

25:02.671 --> 25:05.423
The suspects entered
the factory unit.

25:05.423 --> 25:07.471
AFOs were deployed on my order

25:07.471 --> 25:10.223
and, unfortunately, the
suspects failed to surrender.

25:10.223 --> 25:11.951
They were both
pronounced dead on arrival

25:11.951 --> 25:14.703
at City General Hospital, 15:27.

25:14.703 --> 25:16.303
Fingerprints taken from their bodies

25:16.303 --> 25:18.863
match Lewis Polkard
and Darren Morgan,

25:18.863 --> 25:20.335
both known violent criminals

25:20.335 --> 25:23.215
with longstanding links
to organised crime.

25:23.215 --> 25:25.967
But we got there before they
could destroy any evidence, right?

25:25.967 --> 25:27.311
Yes, sir.

25:27.311 --> 25:29.532
So what about Ryan Pilkington?

25:29.532 --> 25:31.023
At site one, Chloe and her team

25:31.023 --> 25:33.199
captured images of
PC Ryan Pilkington

25:33.199 --> 25:34.863
producing a concealed burner phone

25:34.863 --> 25:37.487
and appearing to make
a call at 14:24 today.

25:37.487 --> 25:39.983
A burner phone was recovered
from the body of Lewis Polkard,

25:39.983 --> 25:42.735
which showed a received
call at 14:24 today.

25:42.735 --> 25:44.532
Now, we believe
Pilkington tipped them off,

25:44.532 --> 25:46.212
but, obviously, we
can't close the loop

25:46.212 --> 25:48.012
without recovering
Pilkington's phone.

25:48.012 --> 25:50.292
Sir, the surveillance team
have obs on Ryan Pilkington.

25:50.292 --> 25:53.103
I've got AFOs standing by to
bring him in.Great work, Chloe.

25:53.103 --> 25:55.572
Could you just give us a
moment, Chloe? Thanks.

25:55.572 --> 26:02.895
Of course, sir.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.903
Let's look at the big picture here.

26:05.903 --> 26:09.167
Ryan Pilkington has been
groomed since childhood

26:09.167 --> 26:11.087
as a fixer for organised crime -

26:11.087 --> 26:14.095
exactly the same
history as Dot Cottan.

26:14.095 --> 26:16.847
Now, Pilkington has
inside information,

26:16.847 --> 26:18.767
you can be sure of that.

26:18.767 --> 26:22.159
But I can guarantee you,
if we bring him in now,

26:22.159 --> 26:24.143
he will say nothing

26:24.143 --> 26:29.652
and we will be left holding a sprat
when we should've landed a mackerel.

26:29.652 --> 26:32.463
Sir, Ryan Pilkington's
embedded within MIT.

26:32.463 --> 26:34.812
He's in a position to
sabotage ongoing operations

26:34.812 --> 26:37.711
and, in my view, he's a danger to
other officers, not least Kate.

26:37.711 --> 26:39.612
I know, listen,
he should be arrested.

26:39.612 --> 26:42.063
Of course, he should be
arrested, and the door locked

26:42.063 --> 26:45.071
and the key thrown away,
but he is the new Caddy

26:45.071 --> 26:49.871
and I can guarantee you he
did not join MIT by accident.

26:49.871 --> 26:52.367
The Fourth Man put him there.

26:52.367 --> 26:55.695
Now, we are so close, so close.

26:55.695 --> 26:59.892
And that is why we're going to keep
Ryan Pilkington under surveillance,

26:59.892 --> 27:02.172
and he will lead us to the big fish.

27:02.172 --> 27:06.852
Do I make myself clear?

27:06.852 --> 27:09.583
Sir.

27:09.583 --> 27:11.695
Sir.

27:11.695 --> 27:18.612
Now we're sucking diesel.

27:18.612 --> 27:20.783
I thought the gaffer was the
one wanting to pull him in

27:20.783 --> 27:22.831
and you talked him out of it?

27:22.831 --> 27:49.332
Looks like he's changed his mind.

27:49.332 --> 27:52.212
As you all know, the Gail Vella
murder weapon was never recovered.

27:52.212 --> 27:55.535
However, the cartridge and bullet
were recovered at the crime scene.

27:55.535 --> 27:57.372
NABIS concluded
the cartridge and bullet

27:57.372 --> 28:00.463
were tailored ammunition
for a workshopped firearm.

28:00.463 --> 28:02.895
The White Rock unit is
equipped with the exact machinery

28:02.895 --> 28:04.495
required for this process.

28:04.495 --> 28:06.132
Excellent.

28:06.132 --> 28:09.743
This is clearly a location
closely linked to OCG activity.

28:09.743 --> 28:13.007
It needs to be thoroughly
examined for fingerprints and DNA

28:13.007 --> 28:15.252
that might match Carl
Banks, or Terry Boyle,

28:15.252 --> 28:18.063
or any accomplices in
Gail Vella's murder.

28:18.063 --> 28:20.175
We've never been closer
to finding who killed Gail

28:20.175 --> 28:22.159
and who plotted her murder.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.335
Well done, everyone, get to it.

28:24.335 --> 28:34.575
Boss.Boss.

28:34.575 --> 28:37.967
Before he was found dead, Jimmy
Lakewell revealed to DI Arnott

28:37.967 --> 28:42.492
that Gail Vella was investigating
the murder of Lawrence Christopher.

28:42.492 --> 28:46.223
In April 2003, Lawrence
Christopher was attacked

28:46.223 --> 28:50.575
outside Edge Park Railway Station
by a gang of white youths.

28:50.575 --> 28:53.327
A passer-by found
Christopher wandering nearby

28:53.327 --> 28:56.783
in a confused state
and called triple nine.

28:56.783 --> 28:59.535
Officers found Christopher
to be uncooperative

28:59.535 --> 29:03.612
and took him into custody,
where he died later that night.

29:03.612 --> 29:07.092
Custody suite video shows
officers mocking Christopher

29:07.092 --> 29:09.492
while he lay
unresponsive in his cell.

29:09.492 --> 29:12.372
A disgrace to the uniform,
every single one of them.

29:12.372 --> 29:18.415
The postmortem detected
an undiagnosed skull fracture.

29:18.415 --> 29:21.935
The wound on Christopher's head
contained deposits of lead,

29:21.935 --> 29:25.135
suggesting he'd been struck
by a piece of lead piping.

29:25.135 --> 29:29.807
The initial police inquiry concluded
that the attack was gang-related.

29:29.807 --> 29:33.071
Following protests from
Christopher's family,

29:33.071 --> 29:35.375
the inquiry team eventually accepted

29:35.375 --> 29:38.319
that the victim had
no gang connections.

29:38.319 --> 29:40.367
In fact, Lawrence Christopher
was an architect

29:40.367 --> 29:42.415
who'd never been in
trouble with the law.

29:42.415 --> 29:45.252
By the time officers
redirected the case,

29:45.252 --> 29:47.292
already two weeks had passed by.

29:47.292 --> 29:50.095
In this time, police
received a number of tip-offs

29:50.095 --> 29:52.335
naming a small group of white youths

29:52.335 --> 29:55.092
with a history of racially
aggravated violence.

29:55.092 --> 29:57.263
Despite this, witnesses
weren't interviewed

29:57.263 --> 29:58.692
for at least another week.

29:58.692 --> 30:00.207
And most damning of all,

30:00.207 --> 30:04.303
forensic evidence from the
suspects homes was never secured.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.055
The SIO at the time
claimed he wasn't aware

30:07.055 --> 30:11.535
it was lawful to arrest the suspects
purely on suspicion of the crime.

30:11.535 --> 30:13.092
Astonishing.

30:13.092 --> 30:15.055
Absolutely beggars belief.

30:15.055 --> 30:16.975
Who was the SIO?

30:16.975 --> 30:22.607
Detective Chief Inspector
Marcus Thurwell.

30:22.607 --> 30:26.575
As a result of the failure to
secure any forensic evidence,

30:26.575 --> 30:30.492
the case against the
suspects was extremely flimsy.

30:30.492 --> 30:33.999
An identification parade took
place more than a month after

30:33.999 --> 30:35.855
Christopher's murder.

30:35.855 --> 30:41.295
By this time, all suspects had
shaved and had short hair cuts.

30:41.295 --> 30:44.559
Witnesses were unable to
provide a positive ID.

30:44.559 --> 30:46.991
All five suspects were
released without charge

30:46.991 --> 30:49.615
and granted anonymity.

30:49.615 --> 30:51.855
Family and friends of
Lawrence Christopher

30:51.855 --> 30:55.119
successfully campaigned for an
inquiry into police failings.

30:55.119 --> 30:57.743
The subsequent
report released in 2005

30:57.743 --> 31:00.175
concluded that procedural errors

31:00.175 --> 31:02.927
had occurred due to
institutional racism

31:02.927 --> 31:06.492
and the assumption that he was
an active participant in crime

31:06.492 --> 31:09.972
rather than an innocent victim.

31:09.972 --> 31:14.447
It's a shameful episode,
and no mistake, but I really...

31:14.447 --> 31:17.775
..I don't see how it could
lead to Gail Vella's murder.

31:17.775 --> 31:19.695
We'll keep digging, sir.

31:19.695 --> 31:24.012
Yes. Good work, good work.

31:24.012 --> 31:31.692
Carry on, you two.

31:31.692 --> 31:37.359
DOOR CLOSES

31:37.359 --> 31:39.855
Sorry you had to dredge all that up.

31:39.855 --> 31:42.671
You OK?

31:42.671 --> 31:46.255
The custody officers were laughing
and

31:46.255 --> 31:50.351
making monkey noises while
Christopher lay dying.

31:50.351 --> 31:52.812
They were all cleared of misconduct,

31:52.812 --> 31:55.452
took early retirement for stress

31:55.452 --> 31:58.095
and claimed tens of
thousands in compensation

31:58.095 --> 32:00.911
on top of their pension.

32:00.911 --> 32:03.855
SHE SCOFFS

32:03.855 --> 32:37.092
How could anyone be OK?

32:37.092 --> 32:42.383
Chloe.

32:42.383 --> 32:44.367
Marcus Thurwell's name
came up in connection

32:44.367 --> 32:45.852
with Sands View Boys' Home.

32:45.852 --> 32:47.375
It was before your time.

32:47.375 --> 32:50.575
Child Sexual Exploitation
involving Councillor Dale Roach,

32:50.575 --> 32:54.372
Chief Superintendent
Patrick Fairbank and others.

32:54.372 --> 32:56.892
Gail Vella interviewed
the PCC about this.

32:56.892 --> 32:59.292
She wanted to know why there
hadn't been a public inquiry.

32:59.292 --> 33:00.623
That's the one.

33:00.623 --> 33:02.479
A social worker named
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd

33:02.479 --> 33:04.719
tried to report the abuse.

33:04.719 --> 33:08.367
He was found dead in 1998 at the
same location, where, more recently,

33:08.367 --> 33:11.055
we found the bodies of
ACC Hilton and Maneet Bindra.

33:11.055 --> 33:13.423
Despite strong forensic
evidence of murder,

33:13.423 --> 33:15.663
Stephens-Lloyd's death was
written off as suicide.

33:15.663 --> 33:19.375
The SIO was Marcus Thurwell.

33:19.375 --> 33:22.575
So you've investigated
Thurwell before?

33:22.575 --> 33:24.943
By the time of our inquiry in 2015,

33:24.943 --> 33:29.103
Thurwell had taken early retirement,
believed to be living in Spain.

33:29.103 --> 33:34.159
The Spanish authorities were able to
capture a surveillance image for us.

33:34.159 --> 33:36.207
Then Thurwell vanished again.

33:36.207 --> 33:38.703
And anyway our inquiry had
convicted the prime suspect,

33:38.703 --> 33:41.172
Chief Superintendent
Patrick Fairbank,

33:41.172 --> 33:44.892
the senior officer most closely
linked to child sexual exploitation.

33:44.892 --> 33:47.172
Sir, I wonder if
Gail discovered the link

33:47.172 --> 33:49.692
between Thurwell and the
Lawrence Christopher case.

33:49.692 --> 33:52.463
Maybe she was
interested in Fairbank, too.

33:52.463 --> 34:05.455
Find out.Sir.

34:05.455 --> 34:24.207
COMPUTER PINGS

34:24.207 --> 34:26.383
Kate, have you got a minute?

34:26.383 --> 34:28.495
Sure.

34:28.495 --> 34:31.247
Steve Arnott claimed AC-12
happened to be at White Rock

34:31.247 --> 34:36.047
because they were
tracking the OCG men.

34:36.047 --> 34:38.223
Yeah.

34:38.223 --> 34:40.975
As well as informing
you of the three possible sites,

34:40.975 --> 34:45.647
I informed AC-12.

34:45.647 --> 34:50.191
Credit for not trying to
insult my intelligence.

34:50.191 --> 34:54.012
They're conducting a lawful inquiry,
   it's my duty to cooperate.

34:54.012 --> 34:58.639
Look, I'm telling you the truth,
Jo, because I trust you with it.

34:58.639 --> 35:01.391
I wouldn't want to
harm your career, Kate.

35:01.391 --> 35:03.567
It's best if you request a transfer.

35:03.567 --> 35:07.812
I'm sure AC-12 would take you back.

35:07.812 --> 35:11.292
You've been distant with me
for days. Is this personal?

35:11.292 --> 35:13.103
I'm your senior officer,

35:13.103 --> 35:14.703
I should be distant.

35:14.703 --> 35:18.799
I thought we were friends.
What's happening here?

35:18.799 --> 35:20.532
So you can tell AC-12?

35:20.532 --> 35:22.703
No. I wouldn't tell
them personal stuff.

35:22.703 --> 35:25.092
And, as for requesting a transfer,
I respectfully decline.

35:25.092 --> 35:39.492
I'm not leaving.

35:39.492 --> 35:41.583
Sir.Yeah?

35:41.583 --> 35:44.015
Patrick Fairbank was moved to
Queen's Chase Open Prison

35:44.015 --> 35:47.215
in 2016 due to declining health.

35:47.215 --> 35:50.892
Gail Vella made a request
to interview him last year.

35:50.892 --> 35:53.231
It was set for September 11th
but never took place,

35:53.231 --> 35:56.815
as she was murdered
the night before.

35:56.815 --> 36:07.932
Call them, set up an interview.Sir.

36:07.932 --> 36:11.215
DI Arnott, DC Bishop, AC-12.

36:11.215 --> 36:24.975
Go ahead, sir.

36:24.975 --> 36:29.711
I know where I'm going!

36:29.711 --> 36:32.532
See?!

36:32.532 --> 36:34.639
I told you!

36:34.639 --> 36:40.932
We'll shout if we need you.

36:40.932 --> 36:43.343
Chief Superintendent Fairbank.

36:43.343 --> 36:47.823
DI Steve Arnott.

36:47.823 --> 36:51.732
I was a DS when you last saw me.

36:51.732 --> 36:56.463
I don't mean to be rude,
I get very...

36:56.463 --> 36:59.727
..mixed up.
We've got some questions.

36:59.727 --> 37:02.543
OK.

37:02.543 --> 37:09.647
We're interested in one of your
former officers, Marcus Thurwell.

37:09.647 --> 37:11.892
Right.

37:11.892 --> 37:14.532
He worked under you
on the Sands View case.

37:14.532 --> 37:21.743
He was a DI back then.

37:21.743 --> 37:26.415
Here's Thurwell
after he became a DCI.

37:26.415 --> 37:29.103
You recognise him now?

37:29.103 --> 37:31.215
I should know the face...

37:31.215 --> 37:34.095
..I'm sorry...

37:34.095 --> 37:36.372
Well, our current inquiries
have linked Thurwell

37:36.372 --> 37:39.983
to the Lawrence
Christopher murder case.

37:39.983 --> 37:41.263
Who?

37:41.263 --> 37:45.492
Lawrence Christopher.

37:45.492 --> 37:46.895
Sorry.

37:46.895 --> 37:50.415
What about Gail Vella?

37:50.415 --> 37:51.972
Who is she again?

37:51.972 --> 37:53.772
Gail Vella.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.599
She was a journalist.

37:55.599 --> 37:59.375
She was investigating the
Sands View scandal.Sands View!

37:59.375 --> 38:03.732
Boys in care abused by Dale Roach
and his cronies, including you!

38:03.732 --> 38:06.372
There were complaints to police,

38:06.372 --> 38:08.015
but you made sure they went nowhere,

38:08.015 --> 38:18.383
so those kids just
carried on suffering!Sir...

38:18.383 --> 38:21.012
Sir...

38:21.012 --> 38:38.735
Get the prison officer.Sir.

38:38.735 --> 38:42.447
I'm sorry about that, Chloe, just...

38:42.447 --> 38:46.607
..you want him to remember what
he did, to acknowledge his crimes.

38:46.607 --> 38:48.372
Yeah.

38:48.372 --> 38:50.652
Yeah, I get it, sir.

38:50.652 --> 38:53.327
I'm sorry that he wasn't more help.

38:53.327 --> 38:56.532
I'll keep digging.

38:56.532 --> 40:50.383
Thank you.

40:50.383 --> 40:56.463
Sorry, boss, I know it's a
bit late.No, what you got?

40:56.463 --> 40:59.791
I've been looking into all
of Gail Vella's prison visits.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.095
Before seeking an interview
with Patrick Fairbank,

41:02.095 --> 41:03.503
she went to Blackthorn.

41:03.503 --> 41:05.231
Yeah, we know.
She talked to Jimmy Lakewell.

41:05.231 --> 41:06.895
That was always over the phone.

41:06.895 --> 41:09.391
She requested face-to-face
interviews

41:09.391 --> 41:12.852
with a number of inmates -
Manish Prasad, Hari Bains.

41:12.852 --> 41:15.791
She did the same at
Brentiss Prison with Roz Huntley,

41:15.791 --> 41:18.543
Tina Tranter and Jane Cafferty.

41:18.543 --> 41:21.743
Makes sense, all officers with past
links to organised corruption.

41:21.743 --> 41:23.772
She even put in a request
to Witness Protection

41:23.772 --> 41:26.863
to interview Gill Biggeloe
and Lisa McQueen.

41:26.863 --> 41:29.487
It was still going through the
pipeline at the time of her death.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.623
Only one person agreed to
be interviewed by Gail -

41:32.623 --> 41:34.159
Lee Banks,

41:34.159 --> 41:36.975
Carl Banks' brother.

41:36.975 --> 41:43.119
Lee Banks agreed to talk?

41:43.119 --> 41:48.372
This was two weeks before we
believe Carl Banks murdered Gail.

41:48.372 --> 41:55.983
Christ.

41:55.983 --> 41:59.823
Lee Banks, DI Steve Arnott, AC-12.

41:59.823 --> 42:03.919
Yeah, you nicked me.

42:03.919 --> 42:06.671
Did you think I'd forget?

42:06.671 --> 42:09.103
I'm looking into the
murder of Gail Vella.

42:09.103 --> 42:11.772
Your brother Carl
is our prime suspect.

42:11.772 --> 42:13.583
Of course he is,

42:13.583 --> 42:15.612
blame the dead guy.

42:15.612 --> 42:17.052
You do not have to say anything,

42:17.052 --> 42:19.692
but it may harm your defence if
you don't mention when questioned

42:19.692 --> 42:21.492
something you later
rely on in court.

42:21.492 --> 42:24.252
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

42:24.252 --> 42:27.407
Now, we know Gail Vella attempted
to interview a number of individuals

42:27.407 --> 42:29.412
in relation to organised corruption.

42:29.412 --> 42:33.103
You agreed to be interviewed
on the 26th of August, 2019.

42:33.103 --> 42:36.252
15 days later, Gail Vella
was found murdered.

42:36.252 --> 42:38.095
And?

42:38.095 --> 42:42.383
So you learned Gail Vella was
talking to people about OCG crimes.

42:42.383 --> 42:45.647
You took responsibility for
drawing out of her what she knew.

42:45.647 --> 42:49.423
You shared the information with
Carl, who passed it up the chain.

42:49.423 --> 42:55.119
The top man, or woman, gave
Carl the order to silence Gail.

42:55.119 --> 42:58.383
How's that for a theory?

42:58.383 --> 43:00.175
Can't help you.

43:00.175 --> 43:02.292
The only problem was
your brother couldn't help

43:02.292 --> 43:07.407
shouting his mouth off about it all.
 There's no way Carl was a rat!

43:07.407 --> 43:08.431
We're done here, mate.

43:08.431 --> 43:10.863
Lee, you're protecting the
people who killed your brother.

43:10.863 --> 43:14.292
You want to talk about rats?
Ask your boss.

43:14.292 --> 43:17.172
Superintendent Hastings?
You've lost me.

43:17.172 --> 43:19.375
Well, he told me there
was a rat in our crew

43:19.375 --> 43:23.292
and that rat turned out to
be an undercover copper,

43:23.292 --> 43:26.652
John Corbett.

43:26.652 --> 44:05.327
So have that.

44:05.327 --> 44:08.463
PHONE RINGS

44:08.463 --> 44:11.599
All right?

44:11.599 --> 44:13.839
Kate, sorry, I...

44:13.839 --> 44:16.591
..I probably shouldn't bother you,

44:16.591 --> 44:18.255
but I didn't know who else to call.

44:18.255 --> 44:21.583
What's up, mate?

44:21.583 --> 44:23.951
I think I've found the real
reason the gaffer gave

44:23.951 --> 44:26.652
50 grand to Steph Corbett.

44:26.652 --> 44:31.695
Go on, I'm listening.

44:31.695 --> 44:43.279
Steve?

44:43.279 --> 44:46.332
Kate.

44:46.332 --> 44:49.743
I want to address the
personal issues we discussed.

44:49.743 --> 44:53.412
I think it's best to do that
outside of a work setting.

44:53.412 --> 44:56.892
Yeah, yeah, we need to talk.

44:56.892 --> 44:59.772
I'll let you know the details later.

44:59.772 --> 45:31.663
Thanks, Jo.

45:31.663 --> 45:35.772
SHE EXHALES DEEPLY

45:35.772 --> 45:48.047
SHE SNIFFLES

45:48.047 --> 45:59.892
SHE SOBS

45:59.892 --> 46:02.412
The gang accused of killing
Lawrence Christopher

46:02.412 --> 46:06.252
were granted anonymity, but I've
uncovered old witness statements

46:06.252 --> 46:10.063
that consistently
named the same suspects.

46:10.063 --> 46:15.252
One of these suspects
was Darren Hunter.

46:15.252 --> 46:22.095
Darren Hunter was
Tommy Hunter's son.

46:22.095 --> 46:26.063
Which raises the distinct
possibility that Tommy Hunter

46:26.063 --> 46:27.855
ordered Marcus Thurwell to sabotage

46:27.855 --> 46:31.332
the Lawrence Christopher murder
inquiry to protect his son Darren.

46:31.332 --> 46:33.972
Sir, I've got no problem
believing Tommy Hunter

46:33.972 --> 46:36.012
manipulated corrupt
officers back in 2003,

46:36.012 --> 46:38.735
but, by the time of Gail Vella's
murder, Tommy was long dead

46:38.735 --> 46:42.612
and his son, Darren, I mean,
he seems too much like a small fry.

46:42.612 --> 46:45.775
So, what are you thinking, son?

46:45.775 --> 46:47.892
I think Gail Vella could
only have been murdered

46:47.892 --> 46:49.615
to protect someone
involved in the original

46:49.615 --> 46:51.151
Lawrence Christopher inquiry,

46:51.151 --> 46:53.007
which means that officer still
wields

46:53.007 --> 46:54.863
a high level of influence
over the OCG.

46:54.863 --> 46:57.372
He's still important enough
to warrant the fallout

46:57.372 --> 47:00.012
from killing someone
as high-profile as Gail Vella.

47:00.012 --> 47:02.052
Thurwell.

47:02.052 --> 47:03.631
Sorry, sir, um,

47:03.631 --> 47:05.487
I don't know if this is relevant,

47:05.487 --> 47:08.559
but I've been looking into other
members of Thurwell's team,

47:08.559 --> 47:10.351
all the officers that were involved

47:10.351 --> 47:17.263
in the Lawrence Christopher
murder inquiry.Yeah.

47:17.263 --> 47:26.223
Detective Constable Ian Buckells.

47:26.223 --> 47:31.343
Inspector Philip Osborne.

47:31.343 --> 47:33.903
Obviously, Osborne's now...

47:33.903 --> 47:37.935
It isn't only Thurwell who
benefits from Gail Vella's murder,

47:37.935 --> 47:41.412
so do Buckells and
the Chief Constable.

47:41.412 --> 47:44.172
It could've been any one
of them who gave the order.

47:44.172 --> 47:45.871
Mother of God.

47:45.871 --> 47:59.055
FAINT:Could all officers and staff
please report to the unit office?

47:59.055 --> 48:00.911
SHE CLEARS THROAT
Thank you.

48:00.911 --> 48:03.023
One or two familiar faces.

48:03.023 --> 48:06.223
One or two conspicuous
by their absence.

48:06.223 --> 48:09.871
For those of you for whatever
inexplicable reason don't know,

48:09.871 --> 48:14.927
I am Detective Chief Superintendent
Patricia Carmichael.

48:14.927 --> 48:16.975
I don't mind "ma'am" or "boss".

48:16.975 --> 48:20.623
I'm not a big fan
of "guvnor" or "gaffer".

48:20.623 --> 48:22.863
Speak of the devil.

48:22.863 --> 48:25.935
Superintendent Hastings.

48:25.935 --> 48:28.452
Sorry to barge in on you like this.

48:28.452 --> 48:33.999
All will become clear if I could
have a moment in your office.

48:33.999 --> 48:39.759
As you were.

48:39.759 --> 48:41.772
I take it you've been informed about

48:41.772 --> 48:43.727
the restructuring of
anti-corruption.

48:43.727 --> 48:45.135
Yes.

48:45.135 --> 48:46.479
But my officers haven't,

48:46.479 --> 48:50.063
so I would thank you for
your discretion, ma'am.

48:50.063 --> 48:52.367
Well, they'll figure
it out soon enough.

48:52.367 --> 48:54.543
This is a kick in the teeth.

48:54.543 --> 48:56.172
My team are the best
in the business.

48:56.172 --> 48:58.212
Really?

48:58.212 --> 48:59.599
Hm.

48:59.599 --> 49:01.455
I've reviewed your case against

49:01.455 --> 49:03.183
Detective Superintendent Ian
Buckells.

49:03.183 --> 49:05.743
The only evidence you have
are files that you recovered

49:05.743 --> 49:09.263
from the boot of his car, none
of which bear his prints or DNA.

49:09.263 --> 49:13.615
Buckells' Solicitor has lodged
a claim for wrongful imprisonment.

49:13.615 --> 49:15.855
Where's the courage of
our convictions, ma'am?

49:15.855 --> 49:20.292
We have a very strong case against
Buckells, a very strong case.

49:20.292 --> 49:23.215
Watertight?
No, not watertight, but...

49:23.215 --> 49:25.647
Therefore, I've recommended
to the Crown Prosecutor

49:25.647 --> 49:28.092
that proceedings against
Ian Buckells are dropped,

49:28.092 --> 49:32.431
so as to avoid the humiliation
of a cracked trial.

49:32.431 --> 49:36.015
Ma'am, you are
undermining AC-12's work.

49:36.015 --> 49:37.615
We have just pulled off

49:37.615 --> 49:41.292
a major, highly successful
surveillance operation

49:41.292 --> 49:43.932
that has stretched our
manpower to the limit

49:43.932 --> 49:45.852
and that is all
going to go for a burton

49:45.852 --> 49:49.212
the second that the Chief
Constable starts swinging his axe.

49:49.212 --> 49:51.132
Yes, since you've
raised surveillance,

49:51.132 --> 49:54.383
you've requested an upgrade to
Intrusive Surveillance on MIT's SIO.

49:54.383 --> 49:56.687
Yes, because we've learned
she has long-standing links

49:56.687 --> 49:58.095
to organised crime.

49:58.095 --> 50:00.335
Meanwhile, you're also
maintaining surveillance

50:00.335 --> 50:02.772
on a probationary constable -
Ryan Pilkington.

50:02.772 --> 50:05.652
I'm sure surveillance of Pilkington
will lead to bigger fish,

50:05.652 --> 50:07.247
I'm sure of it.

50:07.247 --> 50:10.575
Meanwhile, you're also maintaining
surveillance on Terry Boyle,

50:10.575 --> 50:13.135
the prime suspect in
the Gail Vella murder.

50:13.135 --> 50:15.183
Yes, for his own protection!

50:15.183 --> 50:17.743
What needs protecting is
the anti-corruption budget,

50:17.743 --> 50:19.855
which you're going through
like there's no tomorrow,

50:19.855 --> 50:21.492
which in your case
does actually apply.

50:21.492 --> 50:26.895
It takes 24 officers to maintain
surveillance on a single target.

50:26.895 --> 50:30.252
There'll be no money left
by the time I assume command.

50:30.252 --> 50:32.783
And so, for that reason,
and the Chief Constable agrees,

50:32.783 --> 50:35.215
I shouldn't start cold next month.

50:35.215 --> 50:40.143
Pending a budget review
by the Chief Constable and me...

50:40.143 --> 50:42.703
..I gave orders a
short while ago for all

50:42.703 --> 50:45.775
AC-12 surveillance operations
to be suspended immediately.

50:45.775 --> 50:47.892
Ma'am, I must protest.

50:47.892 --> 50:49.812
I have officers in the field.

50:49.812 --> 50:53.412
We are so close to breaking
open Operation Lighthouse

50:53.412 --> 50:56.847
and OCG involvement in Gail Vella's
murder!

50:56.847 --> 50:58.831
FAINT:Which is to be commended,

50:58.831 --> 51:04.335
but I do need to inherit a
department that's fit for purpose.

51:04.335 --> 51:07.092
What's going on?

51:07.092 --> 51:14.063
Nothing good.

51:14.063 --> 51:18.863
PHONE RINGS
Hi, sorry, Jo, just coming in now.

51:18.863 --> 51:21.167
Sorry, Kate, change of plan.

51:21.167 --> 51:25.711
I don't feel comfortable
meeting somewhere so public.

51:25.711 --> 51:28.975
I've just got here.
I'm happy to wait.

51:28.975 --> 51:35.567
I'll text you an address when
I think of somewhere better.

51:35.567 --> 51:36.975
Kate...

51:36.975 --> 51:39.855
..you still there?

51:39.855 --> 51:42.543
Yeah, um, OK.

51:42.543 --> 51:45.295
Text me.

51:45.295 --> 51:54.895
Bye.

51:54.895 --> 52:10.703
Nice one. Good work.

52:10.703 --> 53:10.932
PHONE PINGS

53:10.932 --> 53:12.527
Kate.

53:12.527 --> 53:14.703
Steve, I just wondered
if the surveillance team

53:14.703 --> 53:18.012
had reported anything
suspicious on Jo's obs?

53:18.012 --> 53:19.823
Surveillance just got pulled.

53:19.823 --> 53:21.679
What? Why?

53:21.679 --> 53:23.919
AC-12's being cut back and merged.

53:23.919 --> 53:25.519
Carmichael's taking command.

53:25.519 --> 53:27.972
It's on the Chief Constable's
orders and we just learned

53:27.972 --> 53:30.255
he could've been a beneficiary
of Gail Vella's murder.

53:30.255 --> 53:34.095
Jesus Christ. Listen, Steve, I'm
going to forward you an address.

53:34.095 --> 53:36.143
Jo asked to meet me
in the city centre

53:36.143 --> 53:38.127
and she's last
minute changed her mind -

53:38.127 --> 53:39.663
she's got me in some lorry park.

53:39.663 --> 53:43.247
OK, mate, you should pull out.

53:43.247 --> 53:46.511
Can you hand me your phone?

53:46.511 --> 53:50.095
That's an order.

53:50.095 --> 53:54.767
Thank you.

53:54.767 --> 53:56.559
DI Fleming, DCS Carmichael.

53:56.559 --> 53:58.223
On the orders of
the Chief Constable,

53:58.223 --> 54:02.063
I'm now SIO on the anti-corruption
inquiry into Operation Lighthouse.

54:02.063 --> 54:26.447
What's your sit rep?

54:26.447 --> 54:46.932
Shit, shit.

54:46.932 --> 54:49.743
Sir, Kate's just sent
through a location.

54:49.743 --> 54:52.092
Let's go.Chloe, with me.Sir.

54:52.092 --> 54:56.911
Fletch, get AFO's deployed
urgently to this address.Sir.

54:56.911 --> 54:58.383
Let's just take a breath, shall we?

54:58.383 --> 55:21.615
That's my officer out there.
I'll breathe when she's safe.

55:21.615 --> 55:23.727
Well...

55:23.727 --> 55:26.607
..this wasn't what I expected.

55:26.607 --> 55:27.887
Let's not hang around here, Jo.

55:27.887 --> 55:30.132
We'd rather be indoors
with a glass of wine.

55:30.132 --> 55:31.855
I'm sorry, Kate.

55:31.855 --> 55:34.095
Jo?

55:34.095 --> 55:36.271
I'm so sorry.

55:36.271 --> 55:39.151
What is going on?

55:39.151 --> 55:44.335
Jo wanted to give you a way out.

55:44.335 --> 55:47.052
Should've put in for that transfer.

55:47.052 --> 55:50.351
You've got the bottle if
somebody's already half-drowned.

55:50.351 --> 55:53.615
Put the gun down, stop trying to act
like a big man. You're a little boy.

55:53.615 --> 55:56.052
Try asking John Corbett.

55:56.052 --> 56:02.703
Try asking Maneet Bindra.

56:02.703 --> 56:04.239
You pull that trigger,

56:04.239 --> 56:07.119
there's going to be blood and
gunshot powder all over you,

56:07.119 --> 56:09.423
plus the cartridge and
bullet could go anywhere,

56:09.423 --> 56:10.703
you're never going to find it.

56:10.703 --> 56:12.047
Don't need to.

56:12.047 --> 56:14.863
It's a workshopped gun,
tailored ammunition.

56:14.863 --> 56:15.972
It's untraceable.

56:15.972 --> 56:20.815
Right, you've thought of
everything - except surveillance.

56:20.815 --> 56:23.695
AC-12 were watching the workshop.

56:23.695 --> 56:25.935
They saw you make
the call to the OCG.

56:25.935 --> 56:28.111
They've been tracking you both.

56:28.111 --> 56:30.543
You're never going to
get away with this.

56:30.543 --> 56:32.532
You knew about the surveillance?

56:32.532 --> 56:34.831
No, but it makes sense.

56:34.831 --> 56:36.252
It's what I'd do.

56:36.252 --> 56:37.839
Why would she come here otherwise?

56:37.839 --> 56:39.852
Christ sakes, Jo, you set me up!

56:39.852 --> 56:43.407
Don't move!AH!

56:43.407 --> 56:45.455
Drop the gun!

56:45.455 --> 56:47.183
I've done my bit.

56:47.183 --> 56:48.852
I don't have to stay here and watch.

56:48.852 --> 56:51.372
Ryan, drop the gun!

56:51.372 --> 56:53.532
Drop yours!Drop the gun!
Drop it, Kate!

56:53.532 --> 56:55.572
Drop it.No!Ryan!
Put your gun down!

56:55.572 --> 56:57.167
Drop the gun!
Put your gun down! Drop it!

56:57.167 --> 57:00.559
One more chance Ryan, one
more chance.No!Drop it now!

57:00.559 --> 57:02.172
Drop the fucking...
