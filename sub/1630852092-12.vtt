00:04.070 --> 00:05.270
<i>[Dolly] The only thing
powerful enough</i>

00:05.272 --> 00:08.407
<i>to distract me from darker
thoughts is food.</i>

00:16.216 --> 00:19.184
[voice breaking] <i>Somewhere,
there is this little glimmer of hope.</i>

00:19.186 --> 00:21.653
<i>I just wanna be a normal person.</i>

00:21.655 --> 00:24.256
[panting]

00:32.766 --> 00:35.901
you can't do it
and then I just get mad.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.803
<i>[woman] If I don't
make a change now,</i>

00:37.805 --> 00:39.938
<i>I'm scared
it's gonna be too late.</i>

00:43.510 --> 00:46.578
[groaning] It hurts!

00:46.580 --> 00:49.148
<i>[woman 2] I refuse
to stop fighting.</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:51.283
<i>I have to do this
for my children.</i>

00:56.790 --> 00:58.957
I just drove five hours

00:58.959 --> 01:01.293
to tell you how I feel.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.395
And I will not take her back.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.223
<i>[Dolly] When I wake up...</i>

01:37.797 --> 01:41.033
<i>Carrying around this much
weight hurts more than</i>

01:41.035 --> 01:43.302
<i>anyone can ever imagine.</i>

01:44.037 --> 01:46.105
<i>My whole body hurts.</i>

01:46.107 --> 01:49.007
My calves, my knees,

01:49.009 --> 01:52.311
and my feet, and my lower back

01:52.378 --> 01:55.147
<i>and my head.</i>

01:55.149 --> 01:58.984
<i>I can't even get out of bed
anymore, without needing help.</i>

01:59.619 --> 02:01.787
Chey-Chey.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.923
<i>I live with my mother
but my best friend Cheyanne</i>

02:04.925 --> 02:07.059
<i>helps me when she
is here sometimes.</i>

02:07.061 --> 02:08.694
Good morning.

02:08.696 --> 02:11.330
[Dolly whimpering]

02:19.906 --> 02:21.940
<i>[Cheyanne] I met Dolly
over the internet.</i>

02:21.942 --> 02:24.042
<i>We grew up
not too far from each other.</i>

02:24.044 --> 02:25.410
<i>We didn't know each other.</i>

02:25.412 --> 02:27.212
But the moment I met her,

02:27.214 --> 02:29.948
there was just, like, a spark, like
I have known her my whole life.

02:31.217 --> 02:33.418
<i>So we spend a lot
of time with each other.</i>

02:34.821 --> 02:36.421
[Dolly speaking]

02:37.857 --> 02:38.824
<i>So when I do move around,</i>

02:38.826 --> 02:39.892
<i>I move really slowly.</i>

02:39.894 --> 02:43.862
<i>And I have to be very cautious
of each movement.</i>

02:43.864 --> 02:47.399
And I have to wear this
nasal cannula all the time.

02:48.401 --> 02:50.135
24 hours a day.

02:56.042 --> 02:57.676
<i>My weight has affected my lungs.</i>

02:57.678 --> 03:00.412
I can hardly go
to the bathroom on my own.

03:01.414 --> 03:04.116
<i>I can't even help myself
in the shower.</i>

03:04.118 --> 03:05.417
<i>Somedays I skip it.</i>

03:05.419 --> 03:07.786
<i>And on the days that I do shower</i>

03:07.788 --> 03:10.422
<i>I need Cheyanne and my mom
to come wash me.</i>

03:10.690 --> 03:13.559
<i>Because I struggle to stand.</i>

03:13.561 --> 03:17.095
<i>I can only bear the pain
from standing for ten minutes,</i>

03:17.097 --> 03:19.898
<i>before it becomes excruciating.</i>

03:19.900 --> 03:21.099
Okay, hard part.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.035
Oh, God.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.375
Oh, God. Okay.

03:31.277 --> 03:32.911
<i>[Dolly] There's a lot to do.</i>

03:33.179 --> 03:38.016
<i>I've had a lymphedema mass around
my stomach for four years now. So...</i>

03:47.160 --> 03:50.295
Dolly needs care.

03:50.663 --> 03:52.764
Physical care,

03:52.766 --> 03:56.969
<i>that is hard on me, as a mother.</i>

03:57.403 --> 04:00.005
<i>There's times when I bathe her</i>

04:00.007 --> 04:03.675
<i>that I just can't stop crying</i>

04:03.677 --> 04:06.979
<i>because she's so miserable.</i>

04:07.146 --> 04:10.215
<i>And that hurts me to the core.</i>

04:10.850 --> 04:13.185
[groans] Okay.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.321
<i>We put cornstarch in my folds.</i>

04:22.128 --> 04:26.064
<i>I'll come here,
I'll help give her a shower.</i>

04:26.066 --> 04:28.300
<i>If she needs anything else,
I'll go and do it.</i>

04:28.534 --> 04:30.602
<i>I just love her like a sister.</i>

04:30.604 --> 04:32.971
Like, um... I mean, I haven't
known her my whole life.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.773
But I feel like I did know her.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.042
And she's worth it. [chuckles]

04:46.853 --> 04:48.720
<i>[Dolly] The only thing
powerful enough</i>

04:48.722 --> 04:52.224
<i>to distract me
from darker thoughts is food.</i>

04:52.892 --> 04:56.662
<i>Food is my go-to drug
that takes my pain away.</i>

04:56.664 --> 04:58.997
<i>And I love cooking for Cheyanne.</i>

04:58.999 --> 05:00.932
<i>Because Cheyanne loves
my eggs and bacon.</i>

05:00.934 --> 05:04.202
All right, Cheyanne,
I'm gonna go start breakfast.

05:06.906 --> 05:09.041
I guess I'll just sit here.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.077
Okay.

05:14.580 --> 05:18.250
<i>Food is more than just a
pleasure. It's my reason for existing.</i>

05:22.422 --> 05:24.122
[Cheyanne]
What was that? Like...

05:24.857 --> 05:25.824
15 eggs?

05:25.826 --> 05:28.093
[Dolly] Yeah.

05:28.594 --> 05:31.763
<i>I can't wait for
the first bite of something.</i>

05:31.765 --> 05:35.967
<i>That will make me forget
about all the misery of my life.</i>

05:36.502 --> 05:40.439
- Don't be afraid with the cheese.
- No, never.

05:41.441 --> 05:44.676
<i>Food has caused all the
things I hate about my life.</i>

05:44.678 --> 05:48.680
<i>But it's the only thing I've
ever had to help me feel good.</i>

05:48.682 --> 05:53.185
<i>And I don't know where to
even begin to change that.</i>

05:58.624 --> 06:03.695
Ever since I can remember, food
was just a coping thing, I guess.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.832
It just, like, made me happy.
It still does.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.034
Food just makes me happy.

06:09.669 --> 06:13.038
<i>Growing up, all I know
was, I was chunky.</i>

06:13.906 --> 06:15.974
<i>My mom was a massage therapist</i>

06:15.976 --> 06:18.877
<i>and a hospice caregiver.</i>

06:18.879 --> 06:22.481
<i>And she divorced my father
when I was, like, two years old.</i>

06:22.483 --> 06:25.851
<i>Because my dad
was a drug addict.</i>

06:25.853 --> 06:29.888
<i>And my mom, she gave
my father the ultimatum,</i>

06:29.890 --> 06:33.692
<i>"It's me and the child
or the drugs."</i>

06:33.694 --> 06:36.795
And he chose
the streets and the drugs,

06:36.797 --> 06:39.164
so that's what it is.

06:42.668 --> 06:45.971
- Can you give me a little bit more eggs, please?
- Yeah.

06:46.639 --> 06:50.142
- Is that good or more? Okay.
- No, that's good.

06:51.811 --> 06:56.782
<i>So, my mom raised me and
she did as good as she could.</i>

06:56.784 --> 06:58.784
<i>I was left alone a lot.</i>

06:58.786 --> 07:00.385
<i>And that's how it started.</i>

07:00.387 --> 07:01.853
<i>My relationship with food.</i>

07:01.855 --> 07:05.957
<i>It was just there, so I ate it.</i>

07:05.959 --> 07:11.329
Dolly has always been a bit
different than other children.

07:11.697 --> 07:15.534
<i>And other kids
are harsh and cruel.</i>

07:15.536 --> 07:18.937
<i>So, I've always been
the overprotective mother.</i>

07:18.939 --> 07:23.642
<i>But being singled out
as the fat girl</i>

07:23.644 --> 07:25.844
is quite uncomfortable.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.747
Her whole life
has been that way.

07:28.749 --> 07:31.049
<i>But she really loved her daddy.</i>

07:31.417 --> 07:33.552
<i>She was a lot like him.</i>

07:33.554 --> 07:36.221
<i>Lots of freckles, both of them.</i>

07:37.757 --> 07:41.626
<i>[Dolly] Whenever I would think
about my dad, I would turn to food.</i>

07:41.628 --> 07:44.729
<i>And I liked the feeling I had
when I was eating.</i>

07:44.731 --> 07:47.699
<i>My mom would find the wrappers
and get mad at me.</i>

07:47.701 --> 07:50.268
<i>But there's nothing
she could do, really.</i>

07:59.412 --> 08:02.781
I know that I am
a little Special Ed

08:02.783 --> 08:04.983
because I have mental issues.

08:04.985 --> 08:09.287
<i>But teachers made me feel like I
was more Special Ed than I am.</i>

08:09.655 --> 08:11.857
<i>It just made me wanna eat more.</i>

08:11.859 --> 08:15.393
<i>And by the time I was seven,
I was 120 pounds.</i>

08:16.863 --> 08:18.930
<i>A few years after my dad left,</i>

08:18.932 --> 08:21.533
<i>my mom decided
she was a lesbian.</i>

08:21.535 --> 08:24.035
My mom is someone that
says that she is a lesbian

08:24.037 --> 08:27.873
but I swear to you
that she is bisexual.

08:27.875 --> 08:28.874
[chuckles]

08:28.876 --> 08:31.977
<i>Whatever her orientation is,</i>

08:31.979 --> 08:34.412
<i>my mom being a lesbian,
was traumatic</i>

08:34.414 --> 08:39.918
because kids would make
fun of me and call me a lesbian.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.954
Saying, "Well, Dolly,
if your mom's that,

08:42.956 --> 08:45.757
you're just a fat,
awkward lesbian."

08:45.759 --> 08:48.994
<i>And that made me wanna eat more.</i>

08:49.695 --> 08:53.064
<i>[Cheyanne] During that time,
in the late 2000s,</i>

08:53.066 --> 08:56.568
bullying was an issue
but never really talked about

08:56.570 --> 08:59.671
until it was, like, 2010.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.574
<i>If you were just a little
different or spoke different</i>

09:02.576 --> 09:05.377
<i>or... just anything,
they would pick on you.</i>

09:15.288 --> 09:18.390
<i>[Dolly] I just steadily...
Just kept getting bigger.</i>

09:18.392 --> 09:22.460
<i>And I know that when I
was about 15 or 16 years old,</i>

09:22.462 --> 09:25.864
<i>I was approximately 300 lbs.</i>

09:25.866 --> 09:29.334
But I felt like there was
nothing that I could do about it.

09:29.336 --> 09:32.070
But I was, like, giving up hope.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.673
<i>And I just started
eating junk food</i>

09:34.675 --> 09:36.808
<i>and not giving a care</i>

09:36.810 --> 09:39.578
<i>about anything
and I just ate whatever.</i>

09:39.580 --> 09:41.846
<i>At that point,
I didn't care anymore.</i>

09:41.848 --> 09:45.417
<i>I'd had enough of high school,
and so, I dropped out.</i>

09:47.386 --> 09:49.888
I pulled her out
of regular high school

09:49.890 --> 09:52.824
because the bullying
got so intense.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.660
<i>Thinking that JobCore</i>

09:55.662 --> 10:00.999
<i>would do good things
for her self-esteem.</i>

10:01.001 --> 10:04.135
But of course,
doesn't matter where you go,

10:04.770 --> 10:06.805
people are gonna be cruel.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.540
<i>[Dolly] My mom had
told me about JobCore.</i>

10:08.542 --> 10:11.876
<i>I said, "Okay, sign me up."</i>

10:11.878 --> 10:15.981
<i>I figured things could be
different if I started earning.</i>

10:16.415 --> 10:18.817
<i>My weight did
stabilize for a while.</i>

10:18.819 --> 10:20.852
<i>And when I got
my High School diploma</i>

10:20.854 --> 10:22.721
<i>I was maintaining my weight</i>

10:22.723 --> 10:24.956
<i>at 250 lbs.</i>

10:25.057 --> 10:27.559
She was doing well.

10:27.561 --> 10:29.995
But still had issues.

10:30.763 --> 10:34.866
<i>Dolly is not really good
at bathing herself.</i>

10:34.868 --> 10:37.936
<i>She got in trouble for this
in JobCore.</i>

10:37.938 --> 10:43.074
For not keeping her body
clean and odor-free.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.411
<i>[Dolly] After I completed
my certificate,</i>

10:46.413 --> 10:49.648
<i>I worked for a restaurant
as a prep cook.</i>

10:49.650 --> 10:52.450
<i>Where you pretty much
have to stand for hours,</i>

10:52.452 --> 10:54.653
<i>working around a restaurant.</i>

10:54.655 --> 10:58.723
I was only able to stand up
for, like, 20-30 minutes.

10:58.725 --> 11:01.660
<i>So that only lasted
maybe three or four days.</i>

11:01.662 --> 11:03.294
I'm done, Cheyanne.

11:06.966 --> 11:09.167
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:13.406 --> 11:18.610
<i>After that, I tried working jobs
where I can sit down all day.</i>

11:18.612 --> 11:21.046
<i>I worked at
three different call centers,</i>

11:21.048 --> 11:24.015
<i>but none of those jobs
lasted very long.</i>

11:24.017 --> 11:26.584
'Cause of my asthma, my oxygen.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.119
My heart failure.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.989
<i>All I knew how to do was eat.</i>

11:30.991 --> 11:33.425
<i>And so, my focus
returned to food,</i>

11:33.427 --> 11:35.593
<i>and how to get more of it.</i>

11:35.595 --> 11:37.595
<i>So I was at this crossroads</i>

11:37.597 --> 11:39.964
<i>trying to figure out
what to do next.</i>

11:39.966 --> 11:42.267
<i>And my father took his own life.</i>

11:43.069 --> 11:46.571
His father had just passed
away a week before he did it.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.406
And he took it really hard.

11:48.408 --> 11:52.110
And so he did a whole
heap of methamphetamines,

11:52.112 --> 11:55.113
on purpose, to end his life.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.415
He was sad, he was depressed.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.686
<i>He wasn't a good dad.</i>

12:01.688 --> 12:03.421
<i>He wasn't even a good person</i>

12:03.423 --> 12:06.391
<i>but he was the only
father that I had.</i>

12:06.393 --> 12:09.627
I was in a really bad
depressed mood for a while.

12:09.629 --> 12:13.865
<i>And when I get depressed,
how I deal with that is that I eat.</i>

12:13.867 --> 12:17.001
She didn't have him
a lot, growing up.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.904
<i>So, in the latter years,
before he passed,</i>

12:19.906 --> 12:23.541
<i>she was really proud of that fact
that they were getting really close.</i>

12:23.543 --> 12:28.346
And when she's sad,
she eats those emotions.

12:28.348 --> 12:32.484
<i>[Dolly] I had just turned 21,
and I was 400 lbs.</i>

12:32.486 --> 12:37.021
<i>But I didn't have much income
and I didn't have no place to live.</i>

12:37.957 --> 12:40.859
<i>And that's when I met Ricky,
the man that I married,</i>

12:40.861 --> 12:44.062
<i>on a social media chat thread.</i>

12:45.931 --> 12:48.399
<i>Turned out we had
something in common.</i>

12:48.401 --> 12:51.970
<i>Because Ricky didn't have
anywhere to go either.</i>

12:53.072 --> 12:55.874
<i>Ricky lived close to me,
so we met in person.</i>

12:55.876 --> 12:58.042
<i>And not long after that,</i>

12:58.044 --> 13:00.378
<i>he invited me
to come stay with him</i>

13:00.380 --> 13:02.313
<i>in his bedroom at his mom's.</i>

13:02.315 --> 13:04.682
<i>Because that's where
he was living at the time.</i>

13:04.684 --> 13:08.620
Then I was like, "Okay,
I'm gonna move in with you."

13:08.622 --> 13:10.688
<i>After a few months
living with Ricky,</i>

13:10.690 --> 13:13.525
<i>Ricky would always
say mean things to me.</i>

13:13.527 --> 13:17.395
<i>And then there would be times
when he was abusive.</i>

13:18.831 --> 13:21.833
<i>But then I got pregnant,
so we got married.</i>

13:21.835 --> 13:24.736
<i>And by the time
February rolled around,</i>

13:24.738 --> 13:27.272
<i>I had a baby girl named Trinity.</i>

13:28.407 --> 13:31.109
She's the most
precious thing you never--

13:31.443 --> 13:35.079
She's a beautiful child.

13:35.081 --> 13:40.018
<i>Beautiful spirit. She's just
full of life, full of energy.</i>

13:41.053 --> 13:43.855
<i>I certainly didn't know
three years ago,</i>

13:43.857 --> 13:47.158
<i>I was gonna be a mama,</i>

13:47.160 --> 13:49.093
<i>basically again.</i>

13:49.095 --> 13:52.664
I was given this child by CPS

13:52.666 --> 13:54.399
when she was six days old.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.836
<i>A year later, we went to court</i>

13:57.838 --> 14:03.041
<i>and she and her husband,
at the time,</i>

14:03.043 --> 14:05.810
both proved to the judge

14:05.878 --> 14:08.213
very incompetent.

14:08.215 --> 14:13.351
So I've had custody of
this child, from the word go.

14:18.791 --> 14:23.428
<i>[Dolly] Giving birth to my sweet baby
daughter was the best day of my life.</i>

14:23.430 --> 14:25.730
<i>But there were complications
because of my weight</i>

14:25.732 --> 14:28.600
<i>and because of
all my mental health issues.</i>

14:28.602 --> 14:32.370
My mom ended up
getting custody of Trinity.

14:33.072 --> 14:36.407
<i>Which turned out
to be a blessing.</i>

14:36.409 --> 14:38.710
<i>Ricky was being abusive</i>

14:38.712 --> 14:40.678
<i>and I was really sick</i>

14:40.680 --> 14:43.748
<i>and I told my mom,
"I can't handle this anymore."</i>

14:43.750 --> 14:45.550
And so my mom
took me to the hospital

14:45.552 --> 14:46.751
and I was there for 11 days.

14:46.753 --> 14:49.354
And while I was there,
I had time to think.

14:53.859 --> 14:57.061
<i>[Staci] Ricky took
complete advantage of her.</i>

14:57.663 --> 14:59.631
<i>And he's done so much</i>

14:59.633 --> 15:01.633
<i>to change her life outcome.</i>

15:01.635 --> 15:05.203
He killed her soul.
He killed her spirit.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.906
And he kept making these
comments to my wife and I that--

15:07.908 --> 15:10.441
<i>All I wanted to do
was just feed her fried foods</i>

15:10.443 --> 15:12.143
<i>and watch her get bigger.</i>

15:15.848 --> 15:20.685
<i>[Dolly] Like, whenever I got out of the
hospital, I went home with my mother.</i>

15:20.687 --> 15:22.587
<i>I've been separated
from him ever since.</i>

15:22.589 --> 15:23.988
[Staci] Let's do this!

15:29.762 --> 15:33.998
<i>[Dolly] Me and Cheyanne, we
both have similar health issues.</i>

15:34.566 --> 15:38.236
<i>So when we first met, there
was, like, this immediate bond.</i>

15:39.705 --> 15:42.073
<i>[Cheyanne] I believe we
became best friends really quickly</i>

15:42.075 --> 15:44.409
because we're so much alike.

15:44.411 --> 15:48.846
That it got to the point where we
could finish each other's sentences

15:48.848 --> 15:51.416
and we have the same humor
and everything.

15:56.555 --> 15:59.157
[panting heavily, mumbling]

16:04.363 --> 16:07.632
It's hard to relate
to a skinnier person.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.735
'Cause they don't understand
the struggles we go through.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.838
<i>We get told on a daily,
"Oh, you're big."</i>

16:13.840 --> 16:16.841
<i>I know that I'm big,
you don't have to say it.</i>

16:16.843 --> 16:19.744
<i>It gets to a point where you
don't even look in the mirror</i>

16:19.746 --> 16:24.682
and no-one else
does want that, you know.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.151
- Try the chewy macadamia nut.
- Also my favorite.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.954
- It is? Go figure.
- Yeah.

16:31.857 --> 16:33.291
Um...

16:34.393 --> 16:35.893
I'm gonna put this in the cart.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.695
[Staci] Oh, my God, Dolly.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.665
I'll take one
Italian Cream one, too.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.134
[Staci] Can't believe
she had to have that [bleep].

16:48.474 --> 16:50.575
<i>[Dolly] My mom
tries to make me get</i>

16:50.577 --> 16:53.478
<i>more fruits and vegetables
or even meat.</i>

16:53.480 --> 16:56.714
So, I have a sugary,
salty craving.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.884
<i>I like grains
and breads and pastries.</i>

16:59.886 --> 17:03.988
<i>It's hard for me to get
things for myself usually</i>

17:03.990 --> 17:07.091
<i>because I have to
have my mom's approval.</i>

17:08.093 --> 17:12.830
Dolly's food addiction is sad,
if you really think about it.

17:12.832 --> 17:17.468
<i>Because that's been like a
best friend most of her life.</i>

17:17.470 --> 17:20.705
<i>It doesn't talk back,
all it does is soothe her.</i>

17:20.707 --> 17:24.575
But then she's mad at herself
after she's eaten way too much.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.211
<i>Or she gets--
Makes herself get sick...</i>

17:27.213 --> 17:30.214
Then she's mad.
She's upset with herself.

17:30.682 --> 17:32.250
Mom...

17:32.818 --> 17:35.053
- What?
- What about...

17:35.055 --> 17:37.588
The whole chicken for $18?

17:37.590 --> 17:40.324
[Staci] Yeah, I guess.

17:44.930 --> 17:46.397
<i>[Dolly] I prefer
to go to larger stores</i>

17:46.399 --> 17:50.068
<i>because they're more supportive
for someone in my condition.</i>

17:53.906 --> 17:57.275
Cheyanne's a bigger girl too.
We both get tired easily.

17:58.677 --> 18:00.244
[Staci] Dolly.

18:01.613 --> 18:03.381
It's okay, Dolly.
What do you want?

18:03.383 --> 18:06.050
- [Dolly] Let me get in front.
- Just-- Just do it.

18:06.052 --> 18:09.987
- I know. I wanna just do it but I can't get there.
- Okay. Oh-- Stop.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.122
Don't.

18:13.625 --> 18:14.692
No, don't.

18:14.694 --> 18:18.196
- Oh, God.
- Just do what I asked you to do.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.734
[Dolly] <i>At this point in
my life, I know that I am</i>

18:23.736 --> 18:25.903
killing myself with food.

18:25.905 --> 18:28.573
<i>And I know
that it's an addiction.</i>

18:28.575 --> 18:34.078
<i>I have a pretty serious illness
so if I don't change my ways</i>

18:34.080 --> 18:38.082
and the way I eat, I could,
potentially, not be here anymore.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.353
<i>And I have a three year old
to be here for.</i>

18:42.355 --> 18:44.288
<i>This is not the end for me.</i>

18:44.290 --> 18:47.625
<i>My worst fear is, that I die
and my daughter lives long</i>

18:47.627 --> 18:51.229
<i>and she wonders what life
could have been like with Mom.</i>

18:52.598 --> 18:56.367
That scares me. I will not let
that happen to my daughter.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.669
<i>I need to do
something about it now.</i>

18:58.671 --> 19:01.939
<i>[Staci] Bet she ends up in
the ER before the night's over.</i>

19:01.941 --> 19:06.244
- Huh?
- Bet you end up in the ER before the night's over.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.280
[Dolly] 'Cause I really feel
like I'm gonna pass out.

19:32.871 --> 19:34.205
[grunts]

19:36.208 --> 19:38.009
Hey, good morning.

19:38.810 --> 19:40.244
[Dolly mumbles]

19:42.681 --> 19:44.649
Not so fast.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.984
- Okay, your leg first?
- Yeah.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.388
You wanna move your leg first.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.392
How are you feeling today?

19:55.827 --> 19:58.262
Okay.

20:04.069 --> 20:06.137
<i>Today, I am traveling to Houston</i>

20:06.139 --> 20:07.004
<i>to see Dr. Now.</i>

20:07.006 --> 20:10.208
<i>To try to get help losing weight</i>

20:10.210 --> 20:12.176
<i>and getting a more normal life.</i>

20:15.914 --> 20:18.015
Mm... Yeah.

20:20.619 --> 20:22.386
[grunts]

20:24.690 --> 20:27.558
<i>Part of me is excited
because I want to change.</i>

20:27.560 --> 20:29.427
<i>But part of me is just scared.</i>

20:29.429 --> 20:33.197
<i>Because this is going to be
a very long drive...</i>

20:37.536 --> 20:40.671
<i>around six hours, and I
am already in a lot of pain.</i>

20:40.673 --> 20:44.075
<i>Because I have
a really bad rash.</i>

20:45.744 --> 20:49.847
And I am worried about how
bad it can get on the road.

20:49.849 --> 20:53.117
And how painful it might be
for me to drive all that way.

20:54.853 --> 20:56.254
[grunts]

21:00.926 --> 21:02.426
I'm having shortness of breath.

21:04.696 --> 21:05.663
[exhales]

21:06.765 --> 21:08.899
Should have had it on
in the first place.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.268
I'm having
a hard time breathing.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.071
Hi.

21:14.139 --> 21:15.339
Meow.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.341
Yeah-- meow.

21:18.143 --> 21:21.145
Okay, Trinity.
You're such a showoff.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.784
I forgot to-- Right.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.220
- You wanna spray?
- Yeah, cool.

21:29.222 --> 21:31.222
And then put it
in my bag, please.

21:36.228 --> 21:37.228
Okay.

21:38.430 --> 21:39.397
[grunts]

21:46.938 --> 21:49.073
It's time to load up.

21:49.508 --> 21:52.243
- Do not let her out.
- Move.

21:55.547 --> 21:57.915
<i>[Dolly] Thankfully,
I'll have my mom and Cheyanne</i>

21:57.917 --> 22:00.351
<i>to take care of me on the road.</i>

22:01.486 --> 22:04.922
<i>So it's gonna be
pretty full in the car.</i>

22:04.924 --> 22:07.625
<i>And I can already tell
that we're gonna need to stop</i>

22:07.627 --> 22:08.993
<i>for something to eat.</i>

22:08.995 --> 22:11.028
<i>Just for me
to get myself through it.</i>

22:11.030 --> 22:13.397
Put my oxygen on
when I get in here, Mom.

22:19.638 --> 22:22.173
- Huh?
- Pull yourself up.

22:25.444 --> 22:29.280
<i>[Dolly] I really hope that
Dr. Now says that he can help me.</i>

22:29.282 --> 22:32.350
<i>Because I know I need
his help if I want to live.</i>

22:54.973 --> 22:57.108
[Dolly groans]

22:58.276 --> 23:00.411
I wanted to pee
before I left the house.

23:00.413 --> 23:03.280
- We haven't even gotten out of Fort Worth yet.
- I know this.

23:04.549 --> 23:07.952
Not my fault.
It's the water pills' fault.

23:07.954 --> 23:11.122
[Staci] I have to stop every
five minutes to [bleep] what?

23:12.491 --> 23:14.225
<i>[Dolly] I'm in a lot of pain.</i>

23:14.227 --> 23:17.695
And I can't be done
with this ride soon enough.

23:17.697 --> 23:21.399
<i>Every time I move,
I feel this excruciating pain</i>

23:21.401 --> 23:25.436
<i>in my stomach area where
my rashes are beneath me.</i>

23:26.838 --> 23:28.339
<i>It stings.</i>

23:29.875 --> 23:34.345
<i>It's frustrating because I try to
keep it clean and dry all the time.</i>

23:38.917 --> 23:41.318
<i>But it's like,
there's nothing that I can do.</i>

23:41.320 --> 23:46.023
<i>So I'm just trying to hang on
as best as I can and get there.</i>

23:59.604 --> 24:04.141
A little nervous. Dr. Now is
not gonna sugarcoat anything.

24:06.678 --> 24:10.047
<i>We made it to Houston
in time for my appointment.</i>

24:12.484 --> 24:14.585
How am I gonna get through this?

24:14.587 --> 24:18.722
<i>But the pain I'm in from this
rash has only been getting worse.</i>

24:18.724 --> 24:23.060
<i>And the trip has been
really hard on my body.</i>

24:25.397 --> 24:28.365
<i>It's almost time
for me to step on the scale,</i>

24:28.567 --> 24:31.235
<i>and meet Dr. Now.</i>

24:31.237 --> 24:34.972
<i>And I'm nervous because
so much is riding on this.</i>

24:41.513 --> 24:43.247
Dolly?

24:50.789 --> 24:53.991
<i>[Dolly] I don't know
what Dr. Now is gonna say.</i>

24:53.993 --> 24:57.561
<i>Or if he is going to find
anything wrong with me</i>

24:57.563 --> 24:59.563
<i>that I don't already know about.</i>

24:59.565 --> 25:02.099
If you'll step up
on the scale, please.

25:05.837 --> 25:09.740
<i>I just hope it's not anything
that he can't help me with.</i>

25:09.742 --> 25:11.775
<i>Because if Dr. Now
can't help me,</i>

25:11.777 --> 25:13.410
<i>then no one can.</i>

25:27.025 --> 25:28.826
<i>[Dolly] I'm here
at Dr. Now's in Houston.</i>

25:28.828 --> 25:30.928
<i>To meet with Dr. Now.</i>

25:30.930 --> 25:32.196
<i>And to get my weight checked.</i>

25:34.065 --> 25:37.201
<i>I don't think I'd be
much more than 550.</i>

25:40.405 --> 25:41.972
[nurse] Step down.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.308
We're gonna be going
to room Five.

25:44.609 --> 25:46.911
<i>[Dolly] How did that happen?</i>

25:46.913 --> 25:50.214
<i>It's actually a lot more than
I thought I was going to see.</i>

25:52.651 --> 25:55.052
[Dolly panting heavily]

25:59.791 --> 26:02.993
<i>There's no way
I gained that much.</i>

26:04.262 --> 26:07.064
<i>So that makes no sense.</i>

26:07.999 --> 26:12.069
<i>That's impossible, unless my
scale at home must be wrong then...</i>

26:12.071 --> 26:14.271
- I feel hot...
- [knocking on door]

26:16.708 --> 26:18.742
Hello, how you all doing?

26:18.744 --> 26:21.111
- Doing good, sir.
- We're good.

26:21.113 --> 26:24.381
Good. Well,
you must be Dolly, huh?

26:24.383 --> 26:25.749
[Dolly] Yes, sir.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.484
And who is with you today?

26:27.486 --> 26:29.720
- My mom.
- All right.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.789
- Well, good to meet you both.
- Thank you.

26:31.791 --> 26:34.592
All right, Dolly,
what brought you here?

26:34.594 --> 26:37.461
Well, my weight
and my health brought me here.

26:37.463 --> 26:40.864
- So you're looking to lose weight?
- Mmm-hmm.

26:40.866 --> 26:47.137
All right, so you are
593 pounds and you're 5'2".

26:47.305 --> 26:51.575
- Yes, sir.
- So your BMI is 103.

26:51.577 --> 26:57.147
So that's very high BMI and your body
is under a lot of strain because of that.

26:57.149 --> 27:00.818
So I'm glad to hear you want to
change that and improve your health.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.753
You know what the normal
weight for your height is?

27:02.755 --> 27:05.122
- No.
- 120 pounds.

27:06.858 --> 27:10.427
So you have just over
450 pounds you need to lose.

27:10.429 --> 27:13.197
- And you're 25?
- Yes, sir, I am.

27:13.199 --> 27:17.368
Okay. Well, at what age did you
notice that you were overweight?

27:19.704 --> 27:22.039
Mom, any help from you?

27:22.774 --> 27:26.744
She's had weight issues
most of her life.

27:26.746 --> 27:29.046
You don't have a weight
problem yourself, huh?

27:29.048 --> 27:31.582
- I have had.
- You did?

27:31.584 --> 27:33.083
Just in the last
couple of years,

27:33.085 --> 27:36.820
- I've dropped over 200 pounds myself.
- Okay.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.889
What was your highest weight?

27:38.891 --> 27:42.192
I have been up over 400 myself.

27:42.194 --> 27:44.495
Now I sit at 155.

27:44.497 --> 27:45.829
Well, that's good.

27:45.831 --> 27:48.565
But it sounds like you had
a dysfunctional dynamic

27:48.567 --> 27:51.602
when she was younger, where
you showed her how to overeat,

27:51.604 --> 27:54.972
and then you improved
your health and lost weight.

27:54.974 --> 27:59.843
But you're still enabling her to
be overweight and helping feed her

27:59.845 --> 28:01.378
No, sir. That's not the case.

28:01.579 --> 28:02.846
It's not me.

28:02.848 --> 28:07.685
No, it was... It was mainly
my ex, my husband.

28:07.687 --> 28:10.421
I called my ex,
but we're not exes yet.

28:10.423 --> 28:12.589
I'm married, legally married.

28:12.591 --> 28:14.958
And I was living
with my husband.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.861
He was the one that
was feeding me too much.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.864
- So he was your enabler.
- He was my enabler.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.133
My mom's not
feeding me too much.

28:23.135 --> 28:27.237
Who bring your food?
Does she get it herself?

28:27.239 --> 28:29.873
I cook it and
she comes to the table.

28:29.875 --> 28:34.511
So if that's how she gets her
food, why don't you make less?

28:34.513 --> 28:38.549
I put a regular portion,
the same that I would eat.

28:38.551 --> 28:42.119
I can't help what
she eats between meals.

28:42.121 --> 28:45.289
So, Dolly, what you
eat between meals?

28:45.757 --> 28:48.392
I snack a little too much.

28:48.394 --> 28:51.995
- On what?
- Cookies, brownies. Chips.

28:51.997 --> 28:55.933
Okay, who buys cookies, who
buys brownies, who buys the chips?

28:55.935 --> 29:00.003
Um, so, sometimes
Mom and I buy them.

29:00.005 --> 29:02.506
Sometimes, we get it
from food pantries.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.409
So, Mom,
if I put it all together,

29:05.411 --> 29:08.746
I don't think you're
helping Dolly to lose weight

29:08.748 --> 29:10.948
Because you provide the food.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.217
So I'm gonna change that.

29:13.284 --> 29:14.852
Just don't bring in the house.

29:15.220 --> 29:21.425
So can we agree not to have any cookies
and brownies and chips in the house?

29:21.427 --> 29:22.459
Absolutely.

29:22.461 --> 29:25.996
All right. She's 25
and congestive heart failure

29:25.998 --> 29:31.068
that she's suffering from is in people
when they're seventies or eighties,

29:31.070 --> 29:34.238
so her body is
very close to its limit.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.073
And if anything happened

29:36.075 --> 29:39.443
where she pushes her body over
the limit, she's not going to make it.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.345
So this is very serious,

29:41.347 --> 29:45.616
and I'm going to give you some
instruction I want you both follow.

29:45.618 --> 29:50.387
I'm also going to give you some
instruction to do some exercise.

29:50.389 --> 29:54.324
How much you can walk
before you get out of stamina?

29:55.193 --> 29:57.528
From that parking lot to here.

29:57.530 --> 30:02.065
Her legs are probably going to be bloody
nubs by the time we get to the hotel.

30:03.001 --> 30:04.935
- My...
- You have any swelling in your feet?

30:05.103 --> 30:06.169
Yes.

30:08.573 --> 30:11.441
That's why she can't wear
anything but house shoes.

30:12.777 --> 30:15.946
And this big apron of fat that
you got hanging in your stomach

30:15.948 --> 30:18.549
how long have you had that?

30:18.551 --> 30:20.918
- A few years.
- Okay, all right.

30:20.920 --> 30:24.354
It's not just this
in between my legs.

30:25.190 --> 30:26.690
- It's...
- [mom] What do they call it?

30:26.692 --> 30:27.891
A fupa?

30:27.893 --> 30:30.794
I guess they call it
a fupa nowadays.

30:30.796 --> 30:32.863
I don't know
if you've heard that term.

30:32.865 --> 30:34.731
Well, you know,
that's where your body is

30:34.733 --> 30:37.835
trying to store
some fat here and there.

30:37.837 --> 30:40.671
Ran out of other places, it's
gonna store it over there, too.

30:40.673 --> 30:43.674
Dolly, it's very important
for you to start losing weight

30:43.676 --> 30:46.777
and you're struggling
to even breathe.

30:46.779 --> 30:50.681
If you lose 100 pounds, you
probably won't need that oxygen.

30:50.683 --> 30:52.716
Okay? So this is gonna
be something

30:52.718 --> 30:56.787
that we're gonna have to try a
real way to lose some weight, okay?

30:56.789 --> 30:59.957
Dolly, do you feel like you're
motivated to change your life?

30:59.959 --> 31:02.392
Yes, I have to do
something about my life,

31:02.394 --> 31:06.930
or it's not gonna be very long.

31:06.932 --> 31:07.731
You're very right about that.

31:07.733 --> 31:09.700
So the time to change is now.

31:09.702 --> 31:13.303
So I'm going to bring you
some stuff we are gonna go over.

31:13.305 --> 31:16.406
And if you follow all the
instructions I give you,

31:16.408 --> 31:19.543
you should be able to lose is
at least 80 pounds in a month.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.745
If you stick
with your diet, okay?

31:21.747 --> 31:25.582
But I'm going to give you two
months to lose at least 60 pounds

31:25.584 --> 31:27.551
to show me
you're serious about this.

31:27.553 --> 31:30.621
That's going to be
very easy going for you.

31:30.623 --> 31:33.857
All right, Dolly, I'm gonna go bring
some stuff for you and your mom.

31:33.859 --> 31:36.026
- Okay?
- [Dolly] All right, sir.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.295
- Thank you.
- [Dr. Nowzaradan] Mmm-hmm.

31:41.666 --> 31:43.867
He's not as mean
as everybody says he is.

31:43.869 --> 31:48.038
- Well, just wait.
- [indistinct]

31:49.607 --> 31:53.577
If you come back and you
haven't done what you've been told,

31:53.579 --> 31:56.046
then you're gonna find
the other side of him.

31:56.048 --> 31:57.147
I am gonna do
what I've been told.

31:57.149 --> 31:58.815
Oh, yeah, you're going to
do what you've been told.

31:58.817 --> 32:00.550
You're not gonna keep
that [bleep] in the house.

32:00.552 --> 32:01.685
I'm not gonna
have it in the house,

32:01.687 --> 32:04.988
and I'm gonna stay on you
like white on rice.

32:05.523 --> 32:08.325
There ain't gonna be
none of that, either. No rice.

32:09.861 --> 32:12.229
[Dr. Nowzaradan] <i>I have a
lot of concerns about Dolly.</i>

32:12.231 --> 32:14.631
My biggest concern right now is

32:14.633 --> 32:17.567
whether Dolly is willing
to start to grow up

32:17.569 --> 32:20.404
and take responsibility
for her life,

32:20.406 --> 32:24.841
or if she's still where she
wants to continue justifying

32:24.843 --> 32:28.412
her unhealthy choices
by finding an environment

32:28.414 --> 32:30.447
that supports that for her.

32:31.883 --> 32:34.051
All right.

32:36.854 --> 32:41.558
Well, this is what I want you
to read every day.

32:41.560 --> 32:45.696
The big question is if Dolly's
mom gets rid of the junk food

32:45.698 --> 32:48.532
and starts to make
the home environment

32:48.534 --> 32:50.801
a more positive
and supportive situation,

32:50.803 --> 32:54.204
how is Dolly
going to eventually react?

32:54.206 --> 32:58.608
To being where she can't justify
the same behavior anymore.

32:58.610 --> 33:05.382
Now I'm going to give you this book
near the chapter about exercise, okay?

33:05.384 --> 33:08.318
Is she going to rebel
against it and continue

33:08.320 --> 33:13.190
to seek out dysfunctional scenarios
that give her what she wants?

33:13.192 --> 33:18.061
Or is she going to grow up and
start taking responsibility for her life?

33:18.063 --> 33:19.763
All right.

33:19.765 --> 33:22.833
All right. I'm gonna give you
two months to lose 60 pounds.

33:22.835 --> 33:23.967
- Okay?
- Sure.

33:23.969 --> 33:26.269
So this is gonna
be a goal for you.

33:26.271 --> 33:28.038
So this is gonna
be very important.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.707
No stacking and stick
with healthy eating habit.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.075
Do your exercises.

33:32.077 --> 33:34.244
And if you need anything,
give me a call.

33:34.246 --> 33:35.679
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

33:35.681 --> 33:38.715
All right.
Nice to meet you guys.

33:38.717 --> 33:41.752
And I'm sure your mom is going
to help you to stay healthy.

33:41.754 --> 33:43.720
All right. See you all later.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.355
All right.
Nice to meet you. Thank you.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.324
[Dr. Nowzaradan]
Nice to meet you.

33:51.329 --> 33:55.832
<i>[Dolly] My first meeting with
Dr. Now went okay, I guess.</i>

33:55.834 --> 33:59.036
<i>Right now, I'm encouraged
because I think he can help me.</i>

33:59.038 --> 34:00.871
<i>And he is a nice man.</i>

34:00.873 --> 34:03.206
But it's a lot of weight
<i>to lose.</i>

34:05.376 --> 34:08.712
When Dr. Now said that
<i>I wouldn't live long,</i>

34:08.714 --> 34:14.384
<i>if I continue on this path, it
upset me and made me sad.</i>

34:15.853 --> 34:17.988
<i>I just gotta hunker down.</i>

34:18.790 --> 34:20.690
<i>Is it gonna be easy?</i>

34:20.692 --> 34:24.694
<i>Probably not. Probably gonna be
one of the hardest things I've ever done.</i>

34:24.696 --> 34:27.697
<i>Mom will have to ease me into it</i>

34:27.699 --> 34:31.068
<i>instead of just getting rid
of everything all at once.</i>

34:31.803 --> 34:33.537
<i>It'll be a little hard.</i>

34:33.539 --> 34:37.074
<i>Doing this weight loss
journey with my mom.</i>

34:40.711 --> 34:45.315
<i>Because me and my mom,
our attitudes clash and we argue.</i>

34:46.384 --> 34:48.785
<i>But I need to do this.</i>

34:48.787 --> 34:52.255
<i>I'm not saying I can't do it
because I know I can</i>

34:52.257 --> 34:53.990
<i>so to put my mind up to it.</i>

34:53.992 --> 34:56.259
All right. [panting]

35:08.906 --> 35:11.074
Hey, Dolly,
You wanna go work out?

35:11.076 --> 35:13.076
Yeah, let's go.

35:13.978 --> 35:15.412
Yeah.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.416
- Okay.
- Why don't you go first?

35:19.418 --> 35:23.120
[Dolly] <i>It's been a couple of
weeks since I first saw Dr. Now.</i>

35:25.323 --> 35:29.326
<i>And since then, I've been
really trying to stick with the diet,</i>

35:29.328 --> 35:33.230
<i>and also do all the exercises
that he talks about in his book.</i>

35:33.631 --> 35:36.399
<i>So far, it's been going okay.</i>

35:36.401 --> 35:39.236
Cheyanne has been helping
<i>me a lot with my exercises,</i>

35:39.238 --> 35:41.404
<i>and I'm grateful for that</i>

35:41.406 --> 35:44.975
<i>because I don't know if I could do
as good of a job without her help.</i>

35:44.977 --> 35:49.179
Okay, so... It's like this.

35:52.850 --> 35:56.419
<i>There's upper body that I
have to do and lower body, too.</i>

35:56.421 --> 35:59.389
<i>And I'm supposed to
do them twice a day.</i>

36:01.025 --> 36:05.095
<i>So Cheyanne has been there a
lot, and she's kind of like my trainer.</i>

36:06.531 --> 36:08.598
You do this for 20 times.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.101
And then you do it
the same way backwards.

36:13.137 --> 36:16.039
Once you do 20,
do it the other way.

36:17.208 --> 36:19.142
[Cheyanne laughing]

36:19.710 --> 36:21.311
Oh, my goodness.

36:21.579 --> 36:24.981
I'm the only...
Come on.

36:24.983 --> 36:28.952
All right, you don't have to do...
Exceed yourself every single time.

36:28.954 --> 36:31.855
Just work up to what you can do.

36:31.857 --> 36:34.024
- All right?
- Yeah.

36:34.026 --> 36:36.393
She can wait.
Go sit on the couch for now.

36:36.395 --> 36:37.427
[Cheyanne] Okay.

36:43.668 --> 36:45.535
[Dolly]
<i>One thing that is not cool</i>

36:45.537 --> 36:47.704
is that my mom got rid
<i>of all the junk food</i>

36:47.706 --> 36:50.440
<i>right from when we got back
from seeing the doctor.</i>

36:53.544 --> 36:56.179
Are you girls ready
for something to eat?

36:56.514 --> 36:59.749
-[Dolly] Yeah.
-[Cheyanne] Yeah, I'll take something.

36:59.751 --> 37:04.421
<i>[Dolly] And so that was kind of a
shock to my system that she did it so fast.</i>

37:04.423 --> 37:06.723
<i>I know I needed
those things gone,</i>

37:06.725 --> 37:09.626
<i>but I thought I'd be able
to ease my way out with them</i>

37:09.628 --> 37:12.963
<i>and that was actually
really hard for me.</i>

37:15.900 --> 37:18.001
<i>I wish my mom would have
talked to me about it</i>

37:18.003 --> 37:19.970
<i>or given me some say so.</i>

37:19.972 --> 37:21.871
<i>But I still want the surgery.</i>

37:21.873 --> 37:23.440
<i>So I'm trying
to do the best I can.</i>

37:24.842 --> 37:26.243
Looks good.

37:26.577 --> 37:29.179
us.

37:29.847 --> 37:33.183
[Dolly] I'm doing what <i>Dr. Now
says and what my mom says,</i>

37:33.185 --> 37:36.786
<i>and I'm working to get
approved for surgery.</i>

37:36.788 --> 37:41.658
<i>I don't feel like these are changes
that I can make for the rest of my life.</i>

37:41.660 --> 37:44.160
<i>But I do feel like I can do it
for the short term.</i>

37:44.162 --> 37:46.329
<i>If it's just to get approved.</i>

37:47.665 --> 37:51.101
<i>That's a big goal of mine,
and I'm working towards that.</i>

37:51.836 --> 37:55.071
- Okay, Mom, I'm done.
- Okay.

37:55.806 --> 37:57.173
Thank you for lunch.

37:57.175 --> 37:59.075
- You're welcome, kiddo.
- It was really good.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.944
Thank you.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.445
Glad you liked it.

38:02.447 --> 38:05.048
<i>[Dolly] And when I go back to see
Dr. Now for my next appointment,</i>

38:05.050 --> 38:08.952
<i>I really hope I get approved
for weight loss surgery.</i>

38:08.954 --> 38:11.021
<i>So I don't have to do this
first part for too long.</i>

38:11.023 --> 38:13.223
- [Staci] Need help?
- Uh... Yeah.

38:13.691 --> 38:16.293
<i>Because I'm not super happy.</i>

38:30.608 --> 38:34.477
I am excited about
seeing Dr. Now today.

38:34.479 --> 38:38.615
I'm nervous so well... I feel
like I have made some progress.

38:38.617 --> 38:41.918
I haven't. been eating
quite as much as I had.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.820
We'll see if I had some
weight loss change

38:43.822 --> 38:45.989
and see how
Dr. Now feels about it.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.358
Hopefully, I get an approval

38:48.759 --> 38:50.593
for surgery.

38:50.595 --> 38:53.963
- The scale don't line.
- Well, we're here.

38:55.666 --> 38:58.301
<i>[Dolly] I'm back
in here soon to see Dr. Now.</i>

38:58.303 --> 39:01.638
<i>And I'm about to find out
if I met my weight loss goal.</i>

39:01.640 --> 39:04.674
<i>I really hope I did,
because I basically have had</i>

39:04.676 --> 39:07.577
<i>really anything to eat
since my last appointment.</i>

39:07.579 --> 39:09.412
<i>Sure, I've been having cravings,</i>

39:09.414 --> 39:11.781
<i>but my mom has put
the house on lockdown.</i>

39:11.783 --> 39:14.984
<i>So that's most of the time
there's nothing around.</i>

39:18.756 --> 39:21.658
<i>It just feels unfair
'cause it's too strict.</i>

39:21.660 --> 39:25.128
<i>And if I was doing it for myself,
I would take it more slower,</i>

39:25.130 --> 39:27.964
<i>so it was less shock
to my system.</i>

39:27.966 --> 39:29.366
<i>But Mom doesn't listen.</i>

39:42.747 --> 39:44.013
Dolly?

39:46.984 --> 39:49.252
[Dolly breathing heavily]

39:53.023 --> 39:55.258
Okay, you can go ahead
and step on the scale.

40:12.009 --> 40:14.010
Okay.

40:16.113 --> 40:17.547
- You can go to room five.
- Okay.

40:17.549 --> 40:20.216
<i>[Dolly] I don't understand
what happened.</i>

40:20.218 --> 40:24.020
<i>It doesn't make any sense.
I worked so hard.</i>

40:25.756 --> 40:28.324
I just don't know how
<i>to do more than that</i>

40:28.959 --> 40:32.095
<i>because
my mental status is sucky.</i>

40:32.797 --> 40:36.099
<i>And I feel like I can't do it.</i>

40:36.101 --> 40:38.935
<i>It's too stressful at home.</i>

40:40.137 --> 40:43.339
I was more focused on
<i>being depressed</i>

40:44.008 --> 40:45.975
<i>and...</i>

40:46.610 --> 40:47.844
<i>and other stuff.</i>

40:47.846 --> 40:51.381
<i>And like, I mean,
I tried to do it.</i>

40:52.983 --> 40:55.985
<i>But the temptations
started to get a hold of me,</i>

40:55.987 --> 40:58.054
<i>and I let that win.</i>

40:58.656 --> 41:00.089
[knock on door]

41:01.792 --> 41:03.593
Hello. How are you all doing?

41:03.595 --> 41:05.462
- Good, sir.
- Thank you. How are you?

41:05.464 --> 41:09.799
Good. Well, Dolly,
what's going on with you?

41:09.801 --> 41:14.504
Well, it looks like I've lost
17 pounds since I've seen you.

41:14.506 --> 41:17.140
Well, that's a good start but

41:17.142 --> 41:20.910
you have to do a little bit
better than that.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.579
So what happened this time?

41:22.581 --> 41:24.547
I...

41:24.549 --> 41:26.916
I'm having a hard time
with my portion control.

41:26.918 --> 41:29.853
Essentially, you made
what changes to...

41:29.855 --> 41:32.956
Um, I stopped,
stopped with the bread

41:32.958 --> 41:37.126
and the pastas and rice
and all the sugary stuff.

41:38.028 --> 41:40.797
- Okay.
- No sodas, no juices.

41:40.799 --> 41:43.733
Mom, how is she doing
with her eating habits?

41:43.735 --> 41:46.236
It's just portion control.

41:46.238 --> 41:49.072
I'll put a portion on her plate.

41:50.307 --> 41:54.444
And then later on,
she'll go back for more.

41:55.613 --> 41:58.548
Does she go back
and eat more later on?

41:58.550 --> 42:00.416
That's what I'm saying.
Yes, sir.

42:00.418 --> 42:05.421
I had a craving,
and I let it override me.

42:06.824 --> 42:11.561
So, do you have, like,
something that I could go to

42:11.563 --> 42:13.696
instead of going home?

42:13.698 --> 42:17.600
That could help me with
my temptations and all this

42:17.602 --> 42:19.469
and to help me lose more weight.

42:19.471 --> 42:21.938
Well, why do you need
somebody else to do that?

42:21.940 --> 42:24.874
You have to start taking
responsibility for yourself

42:24.876 --> 42:27.744
and do some stuff for yourself.

42:27.746 --> 42:32.682
Not to depend on people
to do everything for you,

42:32.684 --> 42:35.385
and that is the issue
that you need to work on.

42:36.787 --> 42:39.522
Okay? Do you think
you can do that?

42:39.524 --> 42:41.357
Yes, I'm... I'm trying.

42:41.725 --> 42:45.595
Your life is gonna be
what you wanna make it to be.

42:45.597 --> 42:50.800
So it's going to be all up to you
if you want to be comfortable...

42:50.802 --> 42:55.838
And the life that is going to
be more productive for you.

42:55.840 --> 42:57.674
You're gonna have to
do your part.

42:57.676 --> 43:02.745
It's not going to be up to your
mom or me or rehab people

43:02.747 --> 43:07.417
or some environment
to take care of you.

43:08.586 --> 43:12.855
Essentially, you're going to
have to take care of yourself.

43:12.857 --> 43:16.192
So, you know, you start
doing things for yourselves.

43:16.194 --> 43:18.895
Start making proper decision.

43:18.897 --> 43:21.764
If you have a solution
that you need, ask us.

43:21.766 --> 43:23.399
Ask your mom.

43:23.401 --> 43:27.070
And, oh, we're gonna
tell you what to do

43:27.072 --> 43:31.274
but start doing things
for yourself, okay?

43:31.408 --> 43:32.809
Yes, sir.

43:32.811 --> 43:34.777
So how is your breathing
coming along?

43:34.845 --> 43:37.580
- My breathing?
- Yeah.

43:37.582 --> 43:40.984
It seems like it's getting
a little bit better, easier.

43:41.585 --> 43:45.021
Um, it felt like
it was a lot easier

43:45.023 --> 43:47.323
for me to walk from your
waiting room to here today.

43:48.859 --> 43:52.929
Okay, so 17 pounds made
a little bit of difference...

43:52.931 --> 43:54.797
A little bit
of difference, right.

43:54.799 --> 43:57.300
So what happens
if you lose 50 pounds?

43:57.302 --> 43:58.968
It'll feel a whole lot better.

43:58.970 --> 44:00.536
I know that.

44:00.538 --> 44:02.939
We've got to get you
off of that oxygen.

44:02.941 --> 44:05.675
- Yes, sir.
- And we've got to get you in better shape.

44:05.677 --> 44:08.645
So this is in a situation

44:08.647 --> 44:13.149
that you need to work hard
to change your life

44:13.151 --> 44:15.752
and get yourself
in better shape.

44:15.754 --> 44:16.719
- Yes, sir.
- Okay?

44:16.721 --> 44:19.989
So let's start working harder.

44:19.991 --> 44:22.558
- And if you need anything, give me a call.
- Yes, sir.

44:22.560 --> 44:23.993
Okay?

44:29.900 --> 44:31.634
Dolly seems to have
a lot of challenges

44:31.636 --> 44:34.804
<i>and this is a very difficult
situation to work with her.</i>

44:34.806 --> 44:37.774
<i>She wants everybody
to do everything for her,</i>

44:37.776 --> 44:41.611
and Dolly is not progressing
at this point.

44:41.613 --> 44:46.749
<i>I try to help her out to get
some of the situation addressed.</i>

44:46.751 --> 44:51.521
But Dolly seems to have issues
with the reality and talking things

44:51.523 --> 44:55.091
that may not be factually
<i>correct.</i>

44:55.093 --> 44:59.762
At this point, everything is going
to require a lot of social working

44:59.764 --> 45:01.998
with her and her mom.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.834
<i>I am expecting Dolly
to stick to her diet</i>

45:04.836 --> 45:07.336
and lose 50 pounds.

45:07.338 --> 45:10.273
<i>And we will find out
how she does with that.</i>

45:12.843 --> 45:16.045
<i>[Dolly] That was hard, but
it wasn't as bad as I thought.</i>

45:16.047 --> 45:17.914
<i>I just have to take
the progress I've made</i>

45:17.916 --> 45:20.016
<i>and grow on that.</i>

45:21.719 --> 45:23.853
<i>Yes, it's hard
to imagine doing more</i>

45:23.855 --> 45:26.022
<i>than I already did
this last month.</i>

45:26.024 --> 45:27.390
<i>But you know what?</i>

45:27.392 --> 45:28.825
<i>It's starting to pay off.</i>

45:29.059 --> 45:32.095
<i>It's just going to be hard to
keep doing what I've been doing.</i>

45:43.874 --> 45:44.407
[grunts]

45:48.846 --> 45:49.979
[groans]

45:50.814 --> 45:52.048
[Dolly panting]

46:02.760 --> 46:04.227
Hey, guys. Y'all hungry?

46:04.762 --> 46:05.995
[Staci] Yeah.

46:09.666 --> 46:11.634
Are you going to cook?

46:11.636 --> 46:13.269
Yeah, mommy's about to cook.

46:17.074 --> 46:18.541
[Dolly] <i>Since my last
appointment with Dr. Now,</i>

46:18.543 --> 46:20.810
two weeks ago,

46:20.812 --> 46:24.113
<i>[Dolly] it's just been really hard
being at the house with my mom.</i>

46:24.115 --> 46:26.149
How many pieces
of ham would y'all like?

46:26.151 --> 46:27.550
Just one for me.

46:27.552 --> 46:28.718
Cheyanne.

46:28.720 --> 46:30.419
[Cheyanne] One or two,
it doesn't matter.

46:30.421 --> 46:32.822
<i>[Dolly] She's stressing me out
every day</i>

46:32.824 --> 46:34.257
<i>over how much I'm eating.</i>

46:36.927 --> 46:39.262
<i>And it's making it harder
for me to do well.</i>

46:39.463 --> 46:41.430
<i>Because it makes me irritated,</i>

46:41.432 --> 46:45.201
<i>and it takes my focus off of
where it's supposed to be.</i>

46:46.637 --> 46:49.739
<i>So I've been trying to stick
with the diet and exercise.</i>

46:49.741 --> 46:52.074
<i>But no matter how hard I work,</i>

46:52.076 --> 46:55.978
<i>I just feel like my mom
is never satisfied with me.</i>

46:57.381 --> 46:59.749
<i>Softer than [indistinct]</i>

46:59.751 --> 47:02.785
<i>She treats me like another
three year old toddler.</i>

47:02.787 --> 47:04.187
<i>And it's not right.</i>

47:05.722 --> 47:07.156
The orange plate is mine.

47:10.761 --> 47:11.994
[Staci] She likes it a lot.

47:11.996 --> 47:13.229
Hang on me, baby.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.433
Okay, [indistinct]

47:19.036 --> 47:20.102
My spot.

47:21.405 --> 47:22.939
Move!

47:23.640 --> 47:26.375
<i>[Dolly] In fact, recently,
it's gotten so bad</i>

47:26.377 --> 47:27.410
<i>that I have to do something</i>

47:27.412 --> 47:30.880
<i>just to get away
from the house sometimes.</i>

47:30.882 --> 47:35.017
<i>Like I'll make up a lie about
going somewhere just to get out.</i>

47:35.786 --> 47:37.353
[toddler indistinct shouting]

47:47.598 --> 47:50.099
Do you mind dropping me off
at the park?

47:51.034 --> 47:53.236
[Staci] Sure, I was about
ready to walk out anyway.

47:53.837 --> 47:55.104
[Dolly] Okay.

47:57.941 --> 48:00.176
[wind blowing, leaves rustling]

48:05.048 --> 48:06.115
[smacks lips, grunts]

48:07.017 --> 48:09.085
[panting]

48:16.593 --> 48:18.060
[grunts]

48:36.947 --> 48:41.550
[Staci] Hey, kiddo, I'm gonna
have to just drop you off

48:41.552 --> 48:42.985
and let you do your thing,
all right?

48:42.987 --> 48:45.755
'Cause I've got
a few little errands

48:45.757 --> 48:47.423
and I'll come back and get you.

49:00.103 --> 49:01.370
[out of breath] Okay.

49:04.241 --> 49:05.408
I'll be back in a little bit.

49:05.410 --> 49:06.809
- Okay, love you.
- Love you, too.

49:06.811 --> 49:08.010
[ducks quacking]

49:10.781 --> 49:13.783
<i>[Dolly] I say that I'm going
to go get some exercise,</i>

49:13.785 --> 49:15.885
<i>but then, I don't really
exercise.</i>

49:15.887 --> 49:17.920
<i>Because I'm too tired usually.</i>

49:17.922 --> 49:21.123
<i>So instead, I like to feed
the birds or the ducks.</i>

49:21.725 --> 49:23.926
<i>Sometimes I wish
I was one of them</i>

49:23.928 --> 49:27.430
<i>because they just eat whatever
as much as they can.</i>

49:27.432 --> 49:29.265
<i>And their moms help them eat.</i>

49:31.401 --> 49:33.836
<i>And it feels unfair
that I have this problem,</i>

49:33.838 --> 49:35.972
<i>but I don't blame the ducks.</i>

49:36.873 --> 49:39.275
<i>I just feel trapped with my mom.</i>

49:41.244 --> 49:45.181
<i>So recently, my ex-husband has
been asking me to come back</i>

49:45.183 --> 49:46.515
<i>and live with him again.</i>

49:46.517 --> 49:49.685
<i>And I started to consider it
as a possibility.</i>

49:49.687 --> 49:52.655
<i>I know that he was
abusive and toxic,</i>

49:52.657 --> 49:54.890
<i>but I can't help but feeling
that my mom is</i>

49:54.892 --> 49:58.060
<i>pretty unhealthy for me
right now, too.</i>

49:59.896 --> 50:03.399
<i>And my ex is asking
for something different.</i>

50:03.401 --> 50:05.801
<i>This time, that might
actually be better.</i>

50:05.803 --> 50:08.404
Because he has a wife already.

50:08.406 --> 50:11.340
<i>And he wants to be kind of,
like his sister wife.</i>

50:11.742 --> 50:14.010
<i>So maybe, that would be better.</i>

50:14.012 --> 50:16.712
<i>Because the other girl
would be like more of a buffer</i>

50:16.714 --> 50:19.181
<i>to deal with him
when he's being mean.</i>

50:19.649 --> 50:22.184
<i>I just feel like
that way at least,</i>

50:22.186 --> 50:24.420
<i>I would have
a little bit of freedom,</i>

50:24.422 --> 50:26.756
<i>whereas I have no freedom
with my mom now,</i>

50:26.758 --> 50:28.824
<i>where I'm treated like a kid.</i>

50:28.826 --> 50:32.061
<i>She's just stressing me out
and making me eat more.</i>

50:32.696 --> 50:34.830
<i>So I don't know
what I'm going to do.</i>

50:34.832 --> 50:36.699
<i>I don't wanna be with my mom,</i>

50:36.701 --> 50:39.568
and I don't wanna be
<i>with my ex either.</i>

50:39.570 --> 50:41.170
<i>But I feel like
I need to do something</i>

50:41.172 --> 50:43.139
<i>if I'm going to get the surgery.</i>

50:56.686 --> 50:59.055
[dog barking]

50:59.057 --> 51:01.290
<i>[Dolly] It's been a week since
I moved out to my mom's house.</i>

51:01.925 --> 51:03.159
<i>I'm feeling great.</i>

51:03.161 --> 51:05.428
<i>It was my choice, not hers.</i>

51:05.430 --> 51:07.296
<i>I decided to do it on my own.</i>

51:09.699 --> 51:11.634
<i>The biggest thing is...</i>

51:11.636 --> 51:13.969
You know, now--
It's my husband, now.

51:15.872 --> 51:17.807
<i>Me and my mom had an argument.</i>

51:17.809 --> 51:20.910
And I decided I wasn't
gonna go home,

51:20.912 --> 51:23.412
and instead I went to
a homeless shelter overnight.

51:23.414 --> 51:24.814
<i>The next day.</i>

51:24.881 --> 51:26.715
<i>Sister wife got a hold of me.</i>

51:26.717 --> 51:30.453
And she said to get
a hold of him, so I did.

51:30.455 --> 51:34.657
I video-chatted with him and I
saw his face again and his smile.

51:34.659 --> 51:36.892
<i>I fell in love with him
again all over again,</i>

51:36.894 --> 51:40.029
<i>just from seeing him
on video and--</i>

51:40.031 --> 51:43.099
On the phone and hearing
his voice and his laugh.

51:44.401 --> 51:46.035
<i>So I just came home with him.</i>

51:46.037 --> 51:47.770
Where do you wanna
start off with?

51:47.772 --> 51:49.004
I'm just trying to...

51:49.673 --> 51:52.208
Put your arms like this.

51:52.210 --> 51:54.443
I mean, stretch, stretch your
arms like this, forward.

51:54.445 --> 51:56.078
<i>[Dolly] And then he came
and picked me up,</i>

51:56.080 --> 51:58.214
<i>and from there I moved in
with him that night.</i>

51:58.216 --> 52:01.250
<i>So, I've been eating less.</i>

52:01.852 --> 52:02.985
<i>Less portions.</i>

52:02.987 --> 52:03.953
<i>Like I should.</i>

52:03.955 --> 52:06.489
<i>I've been doing my exercises.</i>

52:06.491 --> 52:08.691
They're not easy,
but I'm doing them.

52:08.693 --> 52:10.693
They're getting a little bit
easier at a time.

52:10.695 --> 52:12.795
<i>But my mom doesn't
like my husband.</i>

52:12.797 --> 52:16.932
<i>So therefore, she is entirely
fed up and...</i>

52:16.934 --> 52:20.970
Pissed off and hurt
and all the other things

52:20.972 --> 52:22.872
that she can be
right now with me.

52:22.874 --> 52:26.675
<i>And I understand to a point,
but I am 25 years old</i>

52:26.677 --> 52:30.746
and I am an adult,
and we, as an adults,

52:30.748 --> 52:34.850
we have boundaries that need
to be set with our parents.

52:34.852 --> 52:36.118
[Ricky] Do you wanna
take a little walk?

52:36.120 --> 52:38.888
Walk this way,
start from this end?

52:38.890 --> 52:40.089
Come on. I'll help you.

52:40.690 --> 52:41.891
All right.

52:41.958 --> 52:43.893
- See, Mom didn't do none of this with me.
- All right.

52:43.895 --> 52:44.960
All right, come on.

52:44.962 --> 52:46.061
<i>[Dolly] But...</i>

52:46.096 --> 52:47.530
<i>I'm fine.</i>

52:47.532 --> 52:49.031
<i>It's life. It goes on.</i>

52:49.033 --> 52:52.034
<i>Having my husband there
to exercise with me</i>

52:52.036 --> 52:54.003
<i>makes me feel good.</i>

52:54.037 --> 52:55.938
<i>Makes me feel like...</i>

52:56.072 --> 52:58.274
<i>I'm special. I'm worth it.</i>

52:58.642 --> 53:00.442
Come on. You can do it.

53:01.978 --> 53:05.414
<i>[Dolly] I just need my mom,
her attitude to get better.</i>

53:05.416 --> 53:07.283
<i>Since she's always got one.</i>

53:11.788 --> 53:12.388
[Ricky] There you go.

53:13.023 --> 53:14.223
You got it.

53:15.759 --> 53:16.992
[Dolly] I wanna sit down.

53:16.994 --> 53:18.327
[Ricky] Yeah.
Yeah, sit down here.

53:18.329 --> 53:19.261
Break. Okay.

53:19.930 --> 53:20.896
There you go.

53:20.898 --> 53:22.198
[panting]

53:22.432 --> 53:23.432
Okay.

53:24.668 --> 53:26.969
[Ricky whispers]
There you go, babe.

53:26.971 --> 53:29.872
You know, my mom didn't ever
try to exercise with me.

53:29.874 --> 53:30.973
It's okay.

53:31.808 --> 53:33.042
I'll help you.

53:33.843 --> 53:36.011
- Okay?
- Appreciate you, baby.

53:36.013 --> 53:37.913
- No problem.
- I love you.

53:37.915 --> 53:39.148
I love you too, baby.

54:05.976 --> 54:08.010
How long are we staying?

54:09.012 --> 54:10.346
I gotta figure out.

54:14.050 --> 54:15.884
<i>[Dolly] So I met someone
a couple of weeks ago.</i>

54:15.886 --> 54:17.753
<i>And his name is Philip.</i>

54:17.755 --> 54:19.321
<i>And he is just about
the sweetest guy</i>

54:19.323 --> 54:20.856
<i>you're ever gonna meet.</i>

54:20.858 --> 54:23.959
<i>And I started dating him,
and one thing led to another.</i>

54:24.427 --> 54:26.228
And now, we moved in together.

54:26.230 --> 54:27.963
We still got seven days.

54:29.633 --> 54:30.366
Okay.

54:32.035 --> 54:34.370
So are you ready for breakfast?

54:35.605 --> 54:37.039
Definitely.

54:37.041 --> 54:38.507
<i>[Dolly] I thought that
being back with my ex</i>

54:38.509 --> 54:40.676
<i>would be a good idea.</i>

54:40.678 --> 54:44.647
<i>And I thought that that whole
situation with him had gotten better.</i>

54:44.649 --> 54:47.950
<i>But I wasn't there but a
few days when, sure enough,</i>

54:47.952 --> 54:50.953
<i>where he was back to his
old and controlling ways.</i>

54:50.955 --> 54:53.055
<i>Being crazy and mean.</i>

54:53.390 --> 54:54.657
<i>And even with Sadie there,</i>

54:54.659 --> 54:56.225
<i>it didn't even make
a difference.</i>

54:56.760 --> 55:00.062
<i>So he was being a jerk,
and the final straw was</i>

55:00.064 --> 55:02.965
<i>when he wouldn't drive me to
my appointment with Dr. Now.</i>

55:02.967 --> 55:05.067
<i>So I wound up missing it.</i>

55:05.069 --> 55:06.835
<i>And luckily, I was able
to reschedule</i>

55:06.837 --> 55:09.071
<i>for a few weeks from now.</i>

55:10.006 --> 55:12.508
<i>And when that happened,
I had flashbacks to the time</i>

55:12.510 --> 55:15.878
<i>that my dad died when Ricky
wouldn't drive me there.</i>

55:15.880 --> 55:19.048
And I just realized
he's still the same old jerk.

55:19.050 --> 55:21.383
<i>And he is never gonna
change his ways.</i>

55:22.719 --> 55:23.886
<i>He is always gonna be a jerk,</i>

55:23.888 --> 55:26.855
<i>and he's no real support
so I left.</i>

55:26.857 --> 55:28.390
<i>And that's when I
moved in with Philip.</i>

55:28.825 --> 55:30.292
Thanks, babe.

55:35.398 --> 55:38.000
<i>And Philip has been like
a godsend who rescued me</i>

55:38.002 --> 55:40.402
<i>because he took me to Houston.</i>

55:40.404 --> 55:42.171
<i>We're living in a hotel now.</i>

55:43.206 --> 55:44.907
<i>Philip is mostly deaf.</i>

55:44.909 --> 55:47.309
<i>But he does have a device
that he can hear with</i>

55:47.311 --> 55:48.510
<i>through his phone.</i>

55:48.512 --> 55:50.979
<i>And he's on disability
so he is using that</i>

55:50.981 --> 55:53.682
<i>to pay for the hotel
so we can be together,</i>

55:53.684 --> 55:55.317
<i>and I can be near Dr. Now.</i>

55:59.723 --> 56:01.090
What's on your mind, baby?

56:01.825 --> 56:03.292
My appointment tomorrow...

56:03.760 --> 56:05.094
With Dr. Now.

56:05.962 --> 56:08.197
And my grandma
and my best friend.

56:10.166 --> 56:12.134
We've got to go...

56:12.702 --> 56:13.936
Yep.

56:14.871 --> 56:16.338
We also got to go see my Mimi.

56:16.773 --> 56:17.906
Mm-hmm.

56:17.908 --> 56:20.075
<i>[Dolly] Philip is more
supportive of me</i>

56:20.077 --> 56:22.344
<i>than anyone else
in my life, ever.</i>

56:22.579 --> 56:24.780
<i>He's like my angel.</i>

56:24.782 --> 56:27.850
<i>He's the love of my life
that I've been waiting for,</i>

56:27.852 --> 56:30.018
<i>and I know the support
is the kind of support</i>

56:30.020 --> 56:31.153
<i>that I finally need.</i>

56:40.163 --> 56:41.730
Babe.

56:41.732 --> 56:43.132
- [Dolly] Yeah.
- The ride's here.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.033
[Philip] Let's go.

56:47.637 --> 56:48.503
Oh, yeah.

56:49.873 --> 56:52.040
Oh, you got the key card
for the room?

56:52.108 --> 56:53.041
I've got it.

56:53.109 --> 56:54.076
Okay.

56:54.078 --> 56:55.377
I have the key card.

57:01.618 --> 57:03.185
Let's take the elevator.

57:05.121 --> 57:07.322
<i>[Dolly] The last month
has been really good.</i>

57:09.225 --> 57:10.392
<i>I don't need oxygen as much,</i>

57:10.394 --> 57:13.228
<i>and I feel like I've made
a lot of progress.</i>

57:15.031 --> 57:19.268
<i>And a big part of that is because
Philip has been such a good support.</i>

57:21.204 --> 57:22.471
I got you, baby.

57:22.538 --> 57:25.941
<i>[Dolly] And I've been feeling
extra encouraged because...</i>

57:25.943 --> 57:29.144
<i>Philip proposed to me
to get married and I said yes.</i>

57:31.581 --> 57:32.915
<i>We haven't set a date yet</i>

57:32.917 --> 57:35.417
<i>because we want my surgery
to come first.</i>

57:37.053 --> 57:39.688
<i>And we want our wedding to be
the start of our new life.</i>

57:39.755 --> 57:41.990
[Dolly grunting]

57:42.892 --> 57:46.094
<i>So I'm really hoping today
that I get approved,</i>

57:46.096 --> 57:48.263
<i>because all of that
is waiting for me.</i>

57:48.265 --> 57:51.066
<i>And I am impatient
to get it all started.</i>

58:03.980 --> 58:05.180
Ow!

58:28.605 --> 58:30.272
- [door opens]
- Dolly?

58:37.981 --> 58:41.416
<i>[Dolly] At my last appointment
I was 576 pounds.</i>

58:43.186 --> 58:45.020
I know this thing weighs more.

58:47.524 --> 58:49.658
As you're ready, go ahead
and step on the scale.

58:49.660 --> 58:53.095
<i>[Dolly] And Dr. Now told me to
lose 60 pounds in two months.</i>

58:53.097 --> 58:54.696
<i>That was more than
two months ago,</i>

58:54.698 --> 58:56.532
<i>but if I lost sixty pounds,</i>

58:56.534 --> 59:00.235
<i>that would put me
down to 516 pounds.</i>

59:08.011 --> 59:10.012
<i>That's weird. I thought
I lost more than that.</i>

59:10.014 --> 59:10.946
We're gonna go over
to Room five.

59:10.948 --> 59:12.648
Okay.

59:12.650 --> 59:13.749
[whispers] Right.
Come on, honey.

59:13.751 --> 59:16.218
<i>[Dolly] But anyways,
I'm still excited</i>

59:16.220 --> 59:17.753
<i>because I've lost
almost 30 pounds now,</i>

59:17.755 --> 59:21.857
<i>and that's almost halfway to
Dr. Now's goal if you add it up.</i>

59:21.859 --> 59:25.594
<i>So I hope he sees the total
of everything that I've done.</i>

59:25.596 --> 59:26.995
<i>And how hard I've been working</i>

59:26.997 --> 59:28.764
<i>even with all this other stuff,</i>

59:28.766 --> 59:31.133
<i>going around all around me.</i>

59:31.768 --> 59:32.634
<i>And the fact that I've been able</i>

59:32.636 --> 59:35.504
<i>to do that much is pretty good.</i>

59:35.506 --> 59:39.241
<i>So maybe he'll approve me for
my weight-loss surgery anyway,</i>

59:39.243 --> 59:41.276
<i>because he knows
I'm really ready for it.</i>

59:43.413 --> 59:44.413
[door thuds]

59:47.850 --> 59:49.851
- Hello. How are y'all doing?
- Good.

59:49.853 --> 59:51.153
How are you doing
today, Dr. Now?

59:51.155 --> 59:53.121
I'm doing well. Thank you.

59:53.123 --> 59:55.190
Dolly, where's your mom?

59:55.592 --> 59:57.159
I moved out of my mom's.

59:57.161 --> 59:58.694
- We got into an argument.
- She moved out.

59:58.696 --> 1:00:00.929
So where are you living now?

1:00:00.931 --> 1:00:04.800
Right now, we're living--
Me and my fiance, Philip.

1:00:04.802 --> 1:00:07.402
We're living in a hotel
here in Houston.

1:00:07.404 --> 1:00:09.538
- So you're living together?
- Yes, sir.

1:00:09.540 --> 1:00:11.106
- Yes.
- Okay.

1:00:11.108 --> 1:00:15.777
- So this is I assume your fiance you just mentioned?
- Yes.

1:00:15.779 --> 1:00:17.145
Okay. Do you work?

1:00:17.647 --> 1:00:18.914
He gets disability.

1:00:18.916 --> 1:00:21.049
Well, you moved out
of your mom's place

1:00:21.051 --> 1:00:22.851
and now you're living in a hotel

1:00:22.853 --> 1:00:24.353
with your new fiance,

1:00:24.355 --> 1:00:26.855
who has no job
and you have no job.

1:00:26.857 --> 1:00:31.226
So how you're managing with
you carry on everything in your life?

1:00:32.795 --> 1:00:35.731
Uh, we just use his
disability check for...

1:00:35.798 --> 1:00:37.132
The hotel.

1:00:37.134 --> 1:00:38.900
For a place to stay,
and then we have...

1:00:38.935 --> 1:00:39.935
Food stamps.

1:00:39.937 --> 1:00:42.638
So we use food stamps
for food and...

1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:44.706
How long do you know each other?

1:00:44.708 --> 1:00:46.842
For like, six weeks
or something like that.

1:00:46.844 --> 1:00:49.978
Okay, Dolly,
you have a child right?

1:00:49.980 --> 1:00:51.613
Yes, and she lives with my mom.

1:00:51.615 --> 1:00:53.915
My mom's got
full custody of her.

1:00:53.917 --> 1:00:55.751
Well, there's at least
some good news

1:00:55.753 --> 1:00:58.186
that your daughter
has some stability,

1:00:58.188 --> 1:01:01.556
but this doesn't seem like
a healthy situation with you,

1:01:01.558 --> 1:01:03.892
and your lack of progress
shows that,

1:01:03.894 --> 1:01:07.029
because you only lost
ten pounds in three months.

1:01:07.031 --> 1:01:09.698
So that means you have
only been losing

1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:11.400
three to four pounds a month.

1:01:11.402 --> 1:01:15.003
You're still eating around
5000 calories a day,

1:01:15.005 --> 1:01:17.906
so I'm worried about that
and your overall situation

1:01:17.908 --> 1:01:20.008
and a lot of things.

1:01:20.010 --> 1:01:23.178
Have you ever seen
any psychiatrists or--

1:01:23.180 --> 1:01:24.046
No, sir.

1:01:24.048 --> 1:01:25.814
So I'm gonna set you up
to go to psych,

1:01:25.816 --> 1:01:29.718
and I wanted to go do that
with your mother, okay?

1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:32.487
Okay. It has to be in Houston
'cause this is where I am.

1:01:32.489 --> 1:01:35.657
Yes, that is in Houston, okay?

1:01:35.659 --> 1:01:39.194
So does this mean that you're
saying "Yes" to my surgery?

1:01:39.196 --> 1:01:42.431
I just have to get approval
from a psych?

1:01:42.433 --> 1:01:46.034
No, this means that I'm
concerned about your behavior,

1:01:46.036 --> 1:01:49.538
and I think it is important
that you start psychotherapy

1:01:49.540 --> 1:01:51.173
to see if they can help you,

1:01:51.175 --> 1:01:53.742
and I want your mom
to go with you for that.

1:01:53.744 --> 1:01:54.810
Okay.

1:01:54.812 --> 1:01:57.679
And also, I want you
to come back with your mom

1:01:57.681 --> 1:02:00.048
for your next appointment
because I trust

1:02:00.050 --> 1:02:04.052
she wants to support you
to get healthy.

1:02:04.054 --> 1:02:06.421
I don't live there anymore so
I'm not really seeing her right now.

1:02:06.423 --> 1:02:08.356
Dolly, if you want to show me

1:02:08.358 --> 1:02:11.626
that you're able and willing
to make the changes you need,

1:02:11.628 --> 1:02:14.863
you need to show me you have
some stability in your life.

1:02:14.865 --> 1:02:17.933
And you need to
at least lose 50 pounds

1:02:17.935 --> 1:02:20.068
over the next two months, okay?

1:02:20.169 --> 1:02:20.969
Okay.

1:02:20.971 --> 1:02:23.338
So, Dolly, we got
a lot of issues

1:02:23.340 --> 1:02:25.040
- that you need to address.
- Yes, sir.

1:02:25.042 --> 1:02:27.876
And at this point, you need to
stick with your diet, okay?

1:02:27.878 --> 1:02:29.077
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

1:02:29.079 --> 1:02:30.612
If you need anything,
give me a call.

1:02:30.614 --> 1:02:31.780
All right, I will do.

1:02:31.782 --> 1:02:34.950
All right, nice to meet you
and I'll see you all later.

1:02:34.952 --> 1:02:37.385
-All right. Thank you
-Nice meeting you, Dr. Now.

1:02:37.387 --> 1:02:40.021
- Okay. Bye now.
- [Dolly] Bye.

1:02:44.994 --> 1:02:47.329
Right now, I'm very
concerned about Dolly.

1:02:47.331 --> 1:02:49.397
<i>I'm glad she's losing
some weight,</i>

1:02:49.399 --> 1:02:52.834
<i>but at this rate, it is not
making much of a difference.</i>

1:02:52.836 --> 1:02:55.904
<i>I gave her a slightly
easier goal last time</i>

1:02:55.906 --> 1:02:59.407
<i>to try to encourage her,
to keep going, and do better</i>

1:02:59.409 --> 1:03:01.109
<i>but that didn't happen.</i>

1:03:01.111 --> 1:03:03.211
Instead, she lost
even less weight

1:03:03.213 --> 1:03:05.614
over a longer period of time,

1:03:05.616 --> 1:03:11.386
<i>and she seemed to be pursuing more
self-destructive situations for herself.</i>

1:03:11.388 --> 1:03:13.855
<i>Living with her mom
was providing her</i>

1:03:13.857 --> 1:03:17.859
<i>with some positive support,
and my concern was</i>

1:03:17.861 --> 1:03:20.529
that she seems to have
a pattern of rebelling,

1:03:20.531 --> 1:03:22.597
<i>against stable environments.</i>

1:03:22.599 --> 1:03:26.067
<i>And seeking out
dysfunctional relationships</i>

1:03:26.069 --> 1:03:29.871
<i>that helped her justify
an unhealthy lifestyle,</i>

1:03:29.873 --> 1:03:31.873
<i>that involves her overeating.</i>

1:03:31.875 --> 1:03:34.242
<i>And that looks
to be the case now.</i>

1:03:34.244 --> 1:03:36.678
With her finding
someone to live with

1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:40.515
and getting engaged to
in less than two months.

1:03:40.517 --> 1:03:43.785
<i>So this isn't a stable
situation with her</i>

1:03:43.787 --> 1:03:46.955
<i>where she can successfully
turn her life around.</i>

1:03:46.957 --> 1:03:49.791
<i>So I want her to go to
psychotherapy</i>

1:03:49.793 --> 1:03:51.893
<i>so we can see
if there is any way</i>

1:03:51.895 --> 1:03:54.162
<i>to break through to her.</i>

1:03:59.502 --> 1:04:01.536
<i>[Dolly] You know,
I actually had my hopes up</i>

1:04:01.538 --> 1:04:04.806
<i>that Dr. Now was gonna
approve me for surgery today.</i>

1:04:04.808 --> 1:04:07.409
<i>So, I'm disappointed
and frustrated</i>

1:04:07.411 --> 1:04:11.112
<i>because I feel like I've been
doing everything right.</i>

1:04:11.114 --> 1:04:13.715
<i>And it feels like with all
the support that I've had,</i>

1:04:13.717 --> 1:04:15.283
<i>and with how hard
I've been working,</i>

1:04:15.285 --> 1:04:17.719
<i>the scale should've
said something better.</i>

1:04:17.721 --> 1:04:22.023
<i>And it feels like Dr. Now is being
prejudiced about me not being with my mom.</i>

1:04:22.025 --> 1:04:23.959
<i>Like if I had been
with her today,</i>

1:04:23.961 --> 1:04:25.894
<i>he would have approved me.</i>

1:04:25.896 --> 1:04:27.863
<i>Even after the same weight.</i>

1:04:27.865 --> 1:04:29.998
<i>But Dr. Now doesn't get it.</i>

1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.300
<i>How my mom is to me right now.</i>

1:04:33.069 --> 1:04:35.704
<i>But whatever I have to do,</i>

1:04:35.706 --> 1:04:37.472
<i>I gotta do it now.</i>

1:04:37.474 --> 1:04:40.408
<i>Because I can't take
much more of this,</i>

1:04:40.410 --> 1:04:44.012
<i>and my life is depending
on getting the surgery.</i>

1:04:55.424 --> 1:04:56.358
[door closes]

1:04:58.327 --> 1:04:59.427
[Dolly out of breath] Okay.

1:05:00.663 --> 1:05:02.898
<i>Me and my mom are headed
to see the therapist</i>

1:05:02.900 --> 1:05:05.166
<i>that Dr. Now is sending us to.</i>

1:05:07.737 --> 1:05:09.838
<i>And I'm a little bit nervous</i>

1:05:09.840 --> 1:05:12.140
<i>about what we're gonna
have to talk about.</i>

1:05:12.541 --> 1:05:15.377
[panting]

1:05:20.783 --> 1:05:23.985
<i>Maybe it would be fun
if it was just me going.</i>

1:05:23.987 --> 1:05:27.088
<i>But with my mom
there, it's kinda stressful.</i>

1:05:31.193 --> 1:05:32.327
Okay.

1:05:32.828 --> 1:05:34.329
Are you Dolly?

1:05:34.331 --> 1:05:36.898
Hi, Dolly. I'm Dr Paradise.
Come on in.

1:05:36.900 --> 1:05:38.066
Have a seat right over there.

1:05:38.267 --> 1:05:39.334
[pants]

1:05:42.939 --> 1:05:44.773
- Comfortable? Okay.
- Yeah.

1:05:44.775 --> 1:05:45.373
I'm glad you're here.

1:05:45.708 --> 1:05:46.942
Nice to see you.

1:05:46.944 --> 1:05:48.710
Tell me a little bit
about yourself.

1:05:48.712 --> 1:05:49.711
So...

1:05:49.713 --> 1:05:51.680
I grew up in Fort Worth.

1:05:51.682 --> 1:05:52.948
- Who are you with?
- [Dolly] Me and my mother.

1:05:52.950 --> 1:05:54.015
You and your mother, okay.

1:05:54.017 --> 1:05:55.817
Where is your biological father?

1:05:55.819 --> 1:05:57.919
He passed away in 2018.

1:05:57.921 --> 1:06:00.422
Did you see your dad
when you were a little kid?

1:06:01.724 --> 1:06:04.960
Yeah. He would come into
my life every now and then.

1:06:04.962 --> 1:06:06.962
- Or try to.
- Okay.

1:06:07.096 --> 1:06:09.965
He was in and out of prison...

1:06:09.967 --> 1:06:12.867
- Doing drugs, dealing things.
- Okay, okay.

1:06:12.869 --> 1:06:15.470
What was your relationship
like with him?

1:06:15.472 --> 1:06:19.374
Uh, at first,
nothing at all really.

1:06:19.376 --> 1:06:21.343
You're kind of flat when you
talk about this stuff.

1:06:21.345 --> 1:06:23.244
This is kind of
emotional things.

1:06:23.246 --> 1:06:26.715
- It's sort of flat.
- I just kind of feel done with everything.

1:06:26.717 --> 1:06:29.951
Dolly, one of the consequences
of having an unreliable dad

1:06:29.953 --> 1:06:33.054
is it can make a kid
feel worthless.

1:06:33.056 --> 1:06:34.656
- I do feel worthless.
- Right.

1:06:34.658 --> 1:06:35.924
I have no self-worth.

1:06:35.926 --> 1:06:40.428
'Cause kids interpret
mistreatment by parents

1:06:40.430 --> 1:06:42.897
as being about their worth.

1:06:42.899 --> 1:06:44.833
And I'm worried that you have--

1:06:44.835 --> 1:06:47.335
And I'm hitting on something,
aren't I?

1:06:48.738 --> 1:06:53.074
Your sense of worth is,
like, this big, right?

1:06:54.944 --> 1:06:57.879
We gotta find something
to make you feel worthwhile.

1:06:57.881 --> 1:07:00.382
And it could be something
small, Dolly.

1:07:01.283 --> 1:07:03.118
What are you good at?

1:07:04.620 --> 1:07:06.621
Failing.

1:07:06.623 --> 1:07:08.923
Okay, well, we can
do better than that.

1:07:08.925 --> 1:07:10.825
Are you okay with me
checking in with your mom?

1:07:10.827 --> 1:07:12.027
Bringing her in?

1:07:12.029 --> 1:07:14.095
Maybe she can tell us
some of your successes.

1:07:14.097 --> 1:07:16.998
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Okay, I'm gonna go get her.

1:07:20.803 --> 1:07:21.702
- Are you Stacy?
- Yeah.

1:07:21.704 --> 1:07:23.405
Hi, Stacy. I'm Dr. Paradise.
Come on in.

1:07:25.674 --> 1:07:27.308
You can have a seat
right over there.

1:07:29.011 --> 1:07:30.779
Thanks for coming.
Welcome.

1:07:30.781 --> 1:07:34.482
You know what-- the thing
we've been talking about is,

1:07:34.484 --> 1:07:38.119
um... Dolly's self-worth is
like this. [chuckles]

1:07:38.121 --> 1:07:41.423
- She has like no self-worth.
- It didn't used to be.

1:07:41.425 --> 1:07:42.390
Tell me about that.

1:07:42.392 --> 1:07:45.894
What's brought her
down to this level...

1:07:45.896 --> 1:07:51.399
- The relationship.
- is picking men who are abusive

1:07:52.635 --> 1:07:55.904
and make her feel
a lot less than what she is.

1:07:55.906 --> 1:07:58.273
So why do you think
she does that?

1:07:59.075 --> 1:08:01.776
She doesn't like being alone.

1:08:01.778 --> 1:08:03.878
She never been alone.

1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:05.413
When are you--
Are you ever alone?

1:08:05.415 --> 1:08:06.548
Like, really just by yourself.

1:08:06.550 --> 1:08:08.016
No, I can't be.

1:08:08.018 --> 1:08:10.518
- Do you see her face?
- [Stacy] Yeah. She's scared.

1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:12.387
I don't wanna leave her.

1:08:12.389 --> 1:08:15.857
Where do you think this constant
need for backup comes from?

1:08:15.859 --> 1:08:18.159
'Cause I've always had
backup all my life.

1:08:18.161 --> 1:08:19.961
My mom's always
been there for me.

1:08:19.963 --> 1:08:22.263
And that's generally
a good thing,

1:08:22.265 --> 1:08:24.699
but I worry that
you didn't grow out of it.

1:08:24.701 --> 1:08:28.970
Are you tired of--
Of parenting her?

1:08:31.073 --> 1:08:33.541
No disrespect to you, but yes.

1:08:33.543 --> 1:08:35.844
I need my own life.

1:08:35.846 --> 1:08:39.447
What I see in your mom
is somebody who's, uh,

1:08:39.449 --> 1:08:43.618
really committed to you
and who also needs a break.

1:08:43.620 --> 1:08:48.223
You just rely on her in ways
that are like a little girl.

1:08:51.060 --> 1:08:52.427
How do we get you to grow up?

1:08:52.429 --> 1:08:55.063
I just feel stuck.

1:08:55.065 --> 1:08:59.134
A healthy person, when they're
confronted with stuff they need to change,

1:08:59.136 --> 1:09:01.436
gets motivated to change it.

1:09:02.905 --> 1:09:04.772
And I think you can be
a healthy person, Dolly.

1:09:04.774 --> 1:09:06.875
I really think you can.

1:09:06.877 --> 1:09:09.544
So, Dolly, I see your homework
as at least two things.

1:09:09.546 --> 1:09:13.381
The first thing is to start
spending some time by yourself.

1:09:13.383 --> 1:09:15.650
I mean, really spending
time with just you.

1:09:15.652 --> 1:09:20.622
And the second is to start
taking on some of these life skills

1:09:20.624 --> 1:09:23.091
that you've been having other
people around to do for you.

1:09:23.093 --> 1:09:25.527
So you could find
a place to live,

1:09:25.529 --> 1:09:26.895
interview the landlord,

1:09:26.897 --> 1:09:30.398
maybe go visit somewhere
and take a look at the apartment.

1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:32.400
Does that sound like
something you could do?

1:09:32.402 --> 1:09:35.136
- [meekly] Yeah.
- I think you're gonna do amazing things.

1:09:35.971 --> 1:09:37.972
Good to see you guys.
Take care.

1:09:40.075 --> 1:09:42.377
[grunts]

1:09:42.379 --> 1:09:45.146
-Take care, Dolly. Have a good night.
-All right.

1:09:47.016 --> 1:09:49.951
You're dragging your dress.
Be careful you don't fall.

1:09:50.786 --> 1:09:51.986
[grunts]

1:10:05.868 --> 1:10:08.937
[grunts]
Oh, gosh.

1:10:15.110 --> 1:10:16.444
All right.

1:10:30.492 --> 1:10:33.228
All right. So...

1:10:35.531 --> 1:10:38.466
-[Cheyanne] Don't start it yet.
-I know.

1:10:38.468 --> 1:10:41.803
<i>Ever since therapy with
Dr. Paradise,</i>

1:10:41.805 --> 1:10:45.573
<i>I've been coming up with a plan
to start doing more for myself.</i>

1:10:45.575 --> 1:10:48.810
<i>And I'm going to start by
doing my own laundry.</i>

1:10:48.812 --> 1:10:52.180
<i>And I think that's going to be
a big step for me.</i>

1:10:52.381 --> 1:10:56.618
Yeah, um,
let me help put some in.

1:10:56.620 --> 1:11:00.788
<i>I'm a little bit worried about not
having the energy to do it all yet.</i>

1:11:00.790 --> 1:11:01.923
- [groans]
- You wanna do it right there?

1:11:01.925 --> 1:11:03.992
- All right.
- [panting] Yeah.

1:11:04.393 --> 1:11:07.061
I'm short.
I can't reach things.

1:11:07.863 --> 1:11:11.733
<i>But, thankfully,
I have Cheyanne here with me</i>

1:11:11.735 --> 1:11:14.202
<i>to make sure everything
is all good.</i>

1:11:14.970 --> 1:11:16.170
[exhales] Okay.

1:11:17.740 --> 1:11:19.274
Hard part over.

1:11:19.276 --> 1:11:20.408
<i>Cheyanne is my rock.</i>

1:11:20.410 --> 1:11:21.876
<i>And I'm really excited because,</i>

1:11:21.878 --> 1:11:24.512
<i>for a little while now,
we've been talking</i>

1:11:24.514 --> 1:11:27.048
<i>about having her
move down to Houston.</i>

1:11:27.050 --> 1:11:30.318
<i>And it's starting to sound
like she's really gonna do it.</i>

1:11:31.020 --> 1:11:33.521
<i>With both Cheyanne
and Phillip helping me,</i>

1:11:33.523 --> 1:11:35.657
<i>and with my mom at
a safe distance,</i>

1:11:35.659 --> 1:11:40.662
<i>I know I'm gonna do it and succeed
and get the surgery next time.</i>

1:11:40.664 --> 1:11:44.699
<i>If I can just get more
independent like Dr. Paradise said,</i>

1:11:44.701 --> 1:11:46.968
<i>and then if we could
find a home to live in,</i>

1:11:46.970 --> 1:11:48.569
<i>the I'll be all set.</i>

1:11:48.571 --> 1:11:50.305
<i>So those are my big goals.</i>

1:11:57.713 --> 1:11:58.980
<i>And that's what I'm going to do.</i>

1:11:58.982 --> 1:12:01.849
<i>Ain't no stopping till
I get to my goal</i>

1:12:01.851 --> 1:12:04.018
<i>and get that dang surgery.</i>

1:12:08.223 --> 1:12:09.991
Okay.

1:12:29.545 --> 1:12:32.947
[grunting] Oh, God.

1:12:47.329 --> 1:12:51.132
<i>Well, me and Phillip finally
found a house to move in to,</i>

1:12:53.302 --> 1:12:56.037
<i>it took a lot longer to find
an option we could afford</i>

1:12:56.039 --> 1:12:57.672
<i>than I thought it would.</i>

1:12:57.674 --> 1:12:59.273
<i>But we finally found one,</i>

1:12:59.275 --> 1:13:02.310
<i>which means I can go back
and see Dr. Now.</i>

1:13:07.549 --> 1:13:10.685
<i>I was putting off my appointment
with him until we found a place,</i>

1:13:10.687 --> 1:13:12.954
<i>because I knew he was
gonna give me a hard time</i>

1:13:12.956 --> 1:13:15.857
<i>if I didn't have a
more consistent home,</i>

1:13:15.859 --> 1:13:18.259
<i>based on what he said last time,</i>

1:13:18.261 --> 1:13:20.027
<i>so I knew that was important.</i>

1:13:20.029 --> 1:13:22.163
Ah!

1:13:22.165 --> 1:13:23.631
Babe, this isn't gonna work.

1:13:23.633 --> 1:13:27.702
Um, they said there was another
entrance around the... side of the house.

1:13:27.704 --> 1:13:29.137
- You wanna go through it?
- Yeah.

1:13:29.139 --> 1:13:31.005
- Come back this way.
- Um, the floor's too...

1:13:31.007 --> 1:13:32.206
uh, creaky,

1:13:32.208 --> 1:13:34.208
so it won't hold my weight.

1:13:34.910 --> 1:13:36.277
So...

1:13:36.845 --> 1:13:38.146
[grunts]

1:13:38.881 --> 1:13:40.581
[panting]

1:13:40.583 --> 1:13:42.116
Okay.

1:13:44.086 --> 1:13:46.187
It's gonna be slippery
over here, baby.

1:13:47.055 --> 1:13:48.990
[Dolly] Um...

1:13:50.926 --> 1:13:54.195
- well...
- Walk this way.

1:13:54.197 --> 1:13:56.397
Any way's gonna be slippery.

1:13:57.065 --> 1:13:57.899
Um...

1:13:57.901 --> 1:14:00.201
[panting]

1:14:02.037 --> 1:14:03.938
- I can't walk through there.
- Well, that's...

1:14:04.740 --> 1:14:06.908
Sink down here.

1:14:06.910 --> 1:14:09.110
- It's more stable--
- What about through here?

1:14:09.112 --> 1:14:12.246
No. 'Cause you'll
sink right there.

1:14:12.514 --> 1:14:13.815
Come on.

1:14:22.558 --> 1:14:25.293
<i>I've been working with
Cheyanne to do more on my own,</i>

1:14:25.295 --> 1:14:27.695
<i>but I've had to balance
Phillip with that.</i>

1:14:27.697 --> 1:14:31.799
<i>Because he gets kind of jealous
and insecure when he's not needed.</i>

1:14:31.801 --> 1:14:36.370
<i>And then he gets upset that I'm
doing too much stuff by myself.</i>

1:14:36.372 --> 1:14:39.974
<i>But I haven't let that stop
me from doing what I need.</i>

1:14:39.976 --> 1:14:44.078
<i>And so, we found this place
online and what it is,</i>

1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:46.047
<i>it's like a bunch of people
all living there</i>

1:14:46.049 --> 1:14:48.182
<i>but everybody has
their own room.</i>

1:14:48.184 --> 1:14:50.017
- Okay.
- [Phillip] Ready?

1:14:52.287 --> 1:14:53.321
[grunts]

1:14:53.323 --> 1:14:54.722
<i>And it's cheap.</i>

1:14:54.724 --> 1:14:57.725
<i>And all we had to do was
pay the first month to get in.</i>

1:14:57.727 --> 1:15:00.161
<i>And it comes with a bed,
and stuff like that.</i>

1:15:00.163 --> 1:15:02.230
<i>So it's perfect for us.</i>

1:15:02.664 --> 1:15:04.565
<i>So I'm excited because</i>

1:15:04.567 --> 1:15:07.969
<i>I'm checking the boxes
Dr. Now needs me to check.</i>

1:15:07.971 --> 1:15:10.872
<i>So I think when I get there,
I'm where I need to be</i>

1:15:10.874 --> 1:15:14.408
<i>for Dr. Now to approve me
for weight-loss surgery.</i>

1:15:16.845 --> 1:15:19.747
<i>My rescheduled appointment
is for next month,</i>

1:15:19.749 --> 1:15:21.849
<i>so I'm gonna go in there
and tell him,</i>

1:15:21.851 --> 1:15:23.784
<i>and he'll see the progress
that I've made</i>

1:15:23.786 --> 1:15:25.987
<i>from following his instructions,</i>

1:15:25.989 --> 1:15:27.421
<i>and then I'm gonna get approved.</i>

1:15:27.423 --> 1:15:29.190
<i>I just know it.</i>

1:15:43.372 --> 1:15:44.872
<i>[Dolly] Me, my mom and Cheyanne</i>

1:15:44.874 --> 1:15:48.910
<i>are on the way to see Dr. Now
for another appointment.</i>

1:15:48.912 --> 1:15:52.413
<i>I thought having Cheyanne
here would be a good buffer</i>

1:15:52.415 --> 1:15:55.850
<i>for my mom
to make her be less intense.</i>

1:15:55.852 --> 1:15:58.019
<i>We've been arguing a lot lately,</i>

1:15:58.021 --> 1:15:59.487
<i>almost every time we talk.</i>

1:15:59.489 --> 1:16:01.889
And I wanted
to have Cheyanne here

1:16:01.891 --> 1:16:05.092
<i>because I know she would have
my back if necessary.</i>

1:16:06.395 --> 1:16:08.596
<i>Phillip isn't here, obviously,</i>

1:16:08.598 --> 1:16:11.766
<i>because he knows my mom
doesn't support our relationship</i>

1:16:11.768 --> 1:16:13.901
<i>and is not very cool about him.</i>

1:16:13.903 --> 1:16:17.338
<i>So we decided it was best
that he didn't come.</i>

1:16:17.340 --> 1:16:19.407
<i>But I'm hoping
for some good news today,</i>

1:16:19.409 --> 1:16:21.909
<i>because I feel like I've
been doing everything right</i>

1:16:21.911 --> 1:16:25.413
<i>with getting more independent
like doing my laundry</i>

1:16:25.415 --> 1:16:28.549
<i>and making some of my own meals.</i>

1:16:28.551 --> 1:16:31.586
<i>I was hoping to tell Dr. Now
that I was in a home already,</i>

1:16:31.588 --> 1:16:33.921
<i>but we got kicked out
the day after we moved in</i>

1:16:33.923 --> 1:16:36.390
<i>because the people tried
to raise the rent.</i>

1:16:36.392 --> 1:16:38.893
<i>So we had to go back
to the hotel.</i>

1:16:38.895 --> 1:16:40.461
<i>And that was
depressing and hard.</i>

1:16:40.463 --> 1:16:43.164
<i>But we're still looking
for another place.</i>

1:16:44.266 --> 1:16:47.201
<i>I wanted to have that
sorted out before I saw him,</i>

1:16:47.203 --> 1:16:50.271
<i>but he wouldn't let me push
my appointment back any further.</i>

1:16:50.273 --> 1:16:53.274
<i>So, it is what it is.</i>

1:17:06.555 --> 1:17:09.357
Dolly?

1:17:09.359 --> 1:17:14.495
<i>[Dolly] At my last appointment four
months ago, I weighed 566 pounds</i>

1:17:14.497 --> 1:17:17.732
<i>and Dr. Now wanted me to lose
60 pounds in two months.</i>

1:17:17.734 --> 1:17:22.470
<i>So if I did that I'd be
506 pounds today.</i>

1:17:22.472 --> 1:17:25.206
[nurse] Whenever you're ready
go ahead and step on the scale.

1:17:25.208 --> 1:17:27.942
<i>[Dolly] That was actually
four months ago,</i>

1:17:27.944 --> 1:17:32.413
<i>so that means I would have had to
lose 120 pounds to stay on target.</i>

1:17:32.415 --> 1:17:34.615
<i>And I'm pretty sure
I didn't do that.</i>

1:17:34.617 --> 1:17:38.285
<i>But I'm hoping I got to the
original goal of 60 pounds,</i>

1:17:38.287 --> 1:17:42.023
<i>which would put me down
around 500 today.</i>

1:17:45.927 --> 1:17:49.597
<i>[Dolly] All right. Well, now I've
lost a total of about 40 pounds.</i>

1:17:49.599 --> 1:17:52.867
<i>That's pretty good.
That's almost 60.</i>

1:17:52.869 --> 1:17:53.901
- Okay, we're gonna go to room five.
- Okay.

1:17:53.903 --> 1:17:56.237
<i>[Dolly] That's more than
I've ever lost before.</i>

1:17:58.740 --> 1:18:01.776
<i>So I'm hoping that should be
enough for Dr. Now</i>

1:18:01.778 --> 1:18:04.078
<i>to approve me for surgery.</i>

1:18:16.792 --> 1:18:18.159
[knocking on door]

1:18:19.795 --> 1:18:21.195
Hello, how you all doing?

1:18:21.197 --> 1:18:22.430
- Hello.
- Hi, how are you doing?

1:18:22.998 --> 1:18:24.565
I'm doing well.

1:18:24.567 --> 1:18:25.700
[Dr. Now] All right, Dolly.

1:18:25.702 --> 1:18:28.903
I'm glad to see you
back with Mom today.

1:18:28.905 --> 1:18:31.572
And I see you lost some
weight, which is positive.

1:18:31.574 --> 1:18:32.773
Yes, sir.

1:18:32.775 --> 1:18:35.042
But it's still not as much
as you should have lost,

1:18:35.044 --> 1:18:37.945
especially after another
four months.

1:18:37.947 --> 1:18:40.481
So, what is going on with you?

1:18:40.483 --> 1:18:42.850
Where are you staying now
and where's your boyfriend?

1:18:42.852 --> 1:18:46.454
Last time you had a new
boyfriend that you just met.

1:18:46.456 --> 1:18:50.024
Yeah. Right now he's
at the hotel,

1:18:50.026 --> 1:18:52.626
since you told me you wanted
me to come back with my mom.

1:18:52.628 --> 1:18:55.529
But I also wanted my best
friend Cheyanne to be here.

1:18:55.531 --> 1:18:57.898
- So that's your best friend?
- Yes.

1:18:57.900 --> 1:19:00.634
Okay. How long have you known
your best friend?

1:19:00.636 --> 1:19:02.837
[Dolly] Um, for maybe a year.

1:19:02.839 --> 1:19:05.639
It feels like we've known
each other forever though.

1:19:05.641 --> 1:19:07.708
[Dr. Now] Well, that's
not reality.

1:19:07.710 --> 1:19:10.711
Reality is that you're
choosing this support system

1:19:10.713 --> 1:19:13.547
with the people
you don't really know,

1:19:13.549 --> 1:19:17.752
after you rejected the support
system you needed with your mom.

1:19:17.754 --> 1:19:21.388
So, Mom, what happened
that she left home?

1:19:22.991 --> 1:19:26.160
I was told
that I'm too controlling.

1:19:26.162 --> 1:19:31.198
I've encouraged her
since she moved in with me

1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:32.767
to not overeat

1:19:32.769 --> 1:19:35.202
and to not eat
what she shouldn't

1:19:35.204 --> 1:19:40.307
and to focus on herself
emotionally, physically,

1:19:40.309 --> 1:19:43.010
all aspects of herself.

1:19:44.212 --> 1:19:47.815
- And she promised that she would do so.
- It's what I should have done.

1:19:47.817 --> 1:19:48.816
And she did not.

1:19:48.818 --> 1:19:52.787
She has moved in
and out of my home,

1:19:52.789 --> 1:19:56.991
in and out on her
3-and-a-half-year-old daughter,

1:19:56.993 --> 1:19:59.093
which is not good
for the child...

1:19:59.861 --> 1:20:01.228
several times.

1:20:01.630 --> 1:20:07.067
And I told her no uncertain
that if she did this again, that's it.

1:20:07.069 --> 1:20:10.337
And I am not going
to take her back in.

1:20:11.873 --> 1:20:13.207
I was cooking for her

1:20:13.209 --> 1:20:16.944
and doing every fricking thing
for her.

1:20:16.946 --> 1:20:18.279
I'm pissed off!

1:20:18.780 --> 1:20:20.147
I'm hurt.

1:20:20.649 --> 1:20:23.050
And I will not take her back.

1:20:23.052 --> 1:20:27.454
I have her 3-and-a-half-year-old
child that I've had custody of

1:20:27.456 --> 1:20:29.423
since she was six days old

1:20:29.425 --> 1:20:36.063
because Dolly does not take
life serious enough.

1:20:36.898 --> 1:20:40.801
She doesn't even have to take
care of her. Just be with her.

1:20:40.803 --> 1:20:44.004
Instead, she slipped out
to go be with her ex.

1:20:44.006 --> 1:20:49.009
Then to be
with this homeless individual.

1:20:49.945 --> 1:20:52.079
I'm sorry if I'm being...

1:20:53.548 --> 1:20:54.582
ugly.

1:20:54.584 --> 1:20:57.184
[Dr. Now] Well, you're
just telling me the truth.

1:20:57.186 --> 1:21:01.755
I just drove five hours
to tell you how I feel.

1:21:01.757 --> 1:21:05.459
- I understand.
- [Staci] I do love my daughter,

1:21:05.461 --> 1:21:09.697
but I will not tolerate
the way she's been living.

1:21:09.699 --> 1:21:14.535
So, obviously, I'm not who
needs to be taking care of you.

1:21:14.537 --> 1:21:17.972
And I certainly don't think
it's that homeless young man.

1:21:18.440 --> 1:21:20.908
[Dr. Now] So, what is
your plan now?

1:21:20.910 --> 1:21:25.880
So, it seems like you cannot
take responsibility for yourself

1:21:25.882 --> 1:21:29.950
and you'd like everybody else
to do everything for you

1:21:29.952 --> 1:21:34.521
and you don't have to make any
decision or be responsible for anything.

1:21:34.523 --> 1:21:38.559
But, you know, you cannot
mistreat everybody around you, too,

1:21:38.561 --> 1:21:43.664
and expect them
to be there for you, okay?

1:21:43.666 --> 1:21:48.569
So, this is something that you're
gonna have to figure out with a therapist

1:21:48.571 --> 1:21:51.906
because so far you have shown us
you're not willing to do what you need.

1:21:51.908 --> 1:21:54.775
And we can't wake you up
to do that.

1:21:54.777 --> 1:21:57.878
So, this is going to be
a long process for you.

1:21:57.880 --> 1:21:59.580
So, we're gonna work with you
for next year

1:21:59.582 --> 1:22:03.717
as long as you go to therapy
and keep losing some weight.

1:22:03.719 --> 1:22:07.655
And hopefully we get to some point
that you have some stability in your life

1:22:07.657 --> 1:22:10.925
and you can take
responsibility for yourself.

1:22:10.927 --> 1:22:13.961
Then weight loss surgery may
be an option later.

1:22:13.963 --> 1:22:15.029
- [Dr. Now] Okay?
- All right.

1:22:15.031 --> 1:22:17.331
So, at this point...

1:22:19.434 --> 1:22:25.773
I think you ought to listen
to the guidance from your mom

1:22:25.775 --> 1:22:30.411
because she's the only one
that has the best interest for you.

1:22:30.413 --> 1:22:33.414
And she's not only
taking care of you,

1:22:33.416 --> 1:22:37.184
she's also taking care
of your daughter.

1:22:41.723 --> 1:22:43.057
I haven't disowned you.

1:22:43.059 --> 1:22:46.026
I just want you to grow
the hell up.

1:22:46.494 --> 1:22:49.763
And take responsibility
for your own actions.

1:22:49.765 --> 1:22:53.334
I know. I should have listened
to you to begin with.

1:22:54.703 --> 1:22:58.672
Okay, Dolly, you have a lot
to figure out in your life,

1:22:58.674 --> 1:23:02.609
but we are going to set up an
appointment with psychotherapy

1:23:02.611 --> 1:23:04.178
for at least once a month.

1:23:04.180 --> 1:23:05.746
- [Dr. Now] Make sure you go to that, okay?
- Yes, sir.

1:23:05.748 --> 1:23:09.383
Well, Mom, I know how you feel.

1:23:09.385 --> 1:23:14.688
Hopefully, with some
psychotherapy, we can get to the point

1:23:14.690 --> 1:23:19.960
that she's gonna be more
responsible and do her own part.

1:23:19.962 --> 1:23:24.131
But until then,
don't give up on her.

1:23:24.133 --> 1:23:25.566
Oh, I'm not.

1:23:25.568 --> 1:23:29.570
Okay, Dolly. In the meantime, if
you need anything, give me a call.

1:23:29.572 --> 1:23:32.840
Now is the time to work hard
if you want to do this.

1:23:32.842 --> 1:23:36.944
And the next time I see you, I
want to see more weight loss.

1:23:36.946 --> 1:23:41.048
- And I hope you'll have some better news for me...
- [Dolly] Yes, sir.

1:23:41.050 --> 1:23:43.851
- regarding your living situation...
- [Dolly] I'll try harder.

1:23:43.853 --> 1:23:45.953
and what you're doing.

1:23:45.955 --> 1:23:49.089
All right, Dolly. I'll see
you around, okay?

1:23:49.091 --> 1:23:50.257
- All right.
- [Dr. Now] All right.

1:23:54.629 --> 1:23:56.263
Ouch. [inhales sharply]

1:23:58.400 --> 1:24:01.068
At this point, I think
that it is very clear

1:24:01.070 --> 1:24:04.505
<i>that Dolly currently has
no intention</i>

1:24:04.507 --> 1:24:08.575
to take responsibility for
herself and get her life together

1:24:08.577 --> 1:24:13.814
<i>because at the end of the day she
doesn't want to do what she should.</i>

1:24:13.816 --> 1:24:17.384
<i>So until Dolly chooses
to grow up and mature,</i>

1:24:17.386 --> 1:24:19.386
we are not moving
ahead with her.

1:24:19.388 --> 1:24:24.558
<i>But because she at least made some
progress each time she has come in,</i>

1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:26.693
<i>we will continue
to work with her</i>

1:24:26.695 --> 1:24:30.197
<i>and provide her
with psychotherapy.</i>

1:24:30.199 --> 1:24:32.399
<i>But everyday her health is
in this state,</i>

1:24:32.401 --> 1:24:36.737
<i>she's rolling the dice on her
body getting to a breaking point.</i>

1:24:36.739 --> 1:24:40.541
<i>And at some point if she
doesn't turn her life around,</i>

1:24:40.543 --> 1:24:42.376
she's gonna run out of time.

1:24:45.046 --> 1:24:47.181
<i>[Dolly] Well, I'm not going
to sugarcoat it.</i>

1:24:47.183 --> 1:24:49.850
<i>I'm upset. I'm really upset.</i>

1:24:49.852 --> 1:24:53.720
<i>And I'm disappointed because I
can't believe I've gone through all of this</i>

1:24:53.722 --> 1:24:56.623
<i>and weight loss surgery is
still far off.</i>

1:24:56.625 --> 1:24:58.859
<i>I don't feel like it's fair
and I'm upset</i>

1:24:58.861 --> 1:25:01.228
<i>because I didn't get
the chance to tell Dr. Now</i>

1:25:01.230 --> 1:25:04.531
<i>all the progress I've made
with doing laundry and stuff.</i>

1:25:04.533 --> 1:25:07.768
<i>He might have given me a
better chance if he knew that stuff,</i>

1:25:07.770 --> 1:25:11.371
<i>but I already know I've made
a world of a difference.</i>

1:25:11.373 --> 1:25:13.907
<i>And I lost 40 pounds,
so that's pretty good.</i>

1:25:13.909 --> 1:25:17.711
<i>So, I'm going to work pretty
hard to show him I can do this</i>

1:25:17.713 --> 1:25:21.548
<i>and that I can be ready
sooner than a year.</i>

1:25:21.550 --> 1:25:24.985
<i>Because I don't think
I need to wait that long.</i>

1:25:24.987 --> 1:25:27.154
<i>I think I can do it before then.</i>
