00:17.751 --> 00:18.843
That's her!

00:43.510 --> 00:44.738
Myon?

02:09.830 --> 02:10.854
Myon!

02:22.142 --> 02:23.871
Very impressive!

02:33.287 --> 02:34.276
<i>"Send message"</i>

02:36.823 --> 02:38.290
Hello?

02:43.564 --> 02:45.657

02:56.243 --> 02:58.541
<i>"One Way/Osaka-Tokyo"</i>

03:28.976 --> 03:30.671
You live around here?!

03:30.777 --> 03:32.802
Right under your nose, huh?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.843
Um, wanna ride?

03:39.253 --> 03:40.220
C'mon.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.116
You wish!

03:41.221 --> 03:43.849
You've got it all wrong!

03:43.957 --> 03:45.254
Oh, sure.

03:47.928 --> 03:52.763
I live with my sister, my dad lives with
a younger woman!

03:52.866 --> 03:54.231
It's a joke.

03:54.835 --> 03:58.236
Mom left one night when we bailed out.

03:59.273 --> 04:05.007
Sorry I haven't kept in touch.
My life's kind of a mess, well, still is!

04:05.112 --> 04:09.515
Don't worry!
Nice to see you're still the same... size!

04:09.616 --> 04:11.277
Haven't they gotten bigger?

04:11.385 --> 04:12.249
My breasts?

04:12.352 --> 04:15.412
Huh, no, your feet! Let's find you a drugstore!

04:15.622 --> 04:17.817
Better yet, a love hotel.

04:17.923 --> 04:18.913
Hey!

04:20.027 --> 04:23.360
Don't move!

04:27.768 --> 04:28.792
Thanks!

04:29.436 --> 04:30.095
Ouch!

04:30.604 --> 04:32.265
What're you doing?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.544
Nishi!

04:41.682 --> 04:43.547
Um!

04:46.153 --> 04:49.020
Would you be sad
if I went out with someone else?

04:49.890 --> 04:53.519
If I married him?

04:55.562 --> 04:56.790
Married!

04:58.665 --> 05:03.500
In junior high, I wrote her a note,
just, "I like you a lot. "

05:04.204 --> 05:07.503
Next day, her turn, "Me too. "

05:07.641 --> 05:09.632
Knocked me off my feet!

05:09.776 --> 05:13.109
We were just 11,
never even held hands after school.

05:13.213 --> 05:16.740
Being shy made things awkward right after!

05:16.850 --> 05:19.978
And we could only exchange letters!

05:20.087 --> 05:23.056
2 years later, during a school trip!

05:23.223 --> 05:26.522
Would you be sad
if I went out with someone else?

05:29.563 --> 05:30.291
<i>"Hotel Tariff"</i>

05:33.500 --> 05:41.339
Made me think! I never had the guts
to make a move, always playing it safe.

05:41.541 --> 05:45.500
Always waiting for someone
to help things develop!

05:46.813 --> 05:49.543
Nishi, what do you want?

05:49.649 --> 05:55.144
You don't fight, you don't get hurt,
you want me to do all the work.

05:55.255 --> 05:58.850
But that's unfair. 'Cos I'm scared too!

05:58.959 --> 06:01.951
We're not school kids anymore, y'know?

06:11.338 --> 06:12.430
What?

06:12.539 --> 06:13.699
I...

06:14.608 --> 06:21.878
I still love you. Don't marry that guy!
I've loved you for 11 years!

06:22.082 --> 06:27.714
You should marry me!

06:33.827 --> 06:35.124
I'm...

06:35.562 --> 06:37.052
I'm really happy!

06:44.838 --> 06:47.432
But I love him too.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.907
But I'm so happy now!

06:50.477 --> 06:54.072
Myon, I'm not sure I get it,
but give me some time!

06:54.181 --> 06:56.581
Give me a chance, please.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.912
OK, Nishi! Give it your best shot!

07:00.020 --> 07:02.648
You bet!

07:03.390 --> 07:04.687
Nishi?

07:05.859 --> 07:08.157
Nishi? Nishi!

07:10.130 --> 07:11.961
Think I'm too young to marry?

07:12.065 --> 07:13.930
Yeah.

07:16.570 --> 07:21.303
So, you'll be off limits to future suitors!

07:21.408 --> 07:26.175
Some are crying themselves to sleep right now.

07:26.713 --> 07:29.773
Well I hope you'll be really happy.

07:30.317 --> 07:35.516
Too bad! You don't like me
like you used to!

07:36.389 --> 07:41.884
What are you talking about?
I love you forever!

07:41.995 --> 07:43.257
You haven't changed.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.797
You can be sure about that!

07:45.899 --> 07:47.423
You want to eat yakitori?

07:47.834 --> 07:49.028
Sure!

07:49.636 --> 07:52.036
My sister and I have our own place!

07:52.138 --> 07:53.002
Really?

07:53.106 --> 07:54.733
Gotta make a living!

07:55.675 --> 07:58.405
We've given up on the loans.

07:59.045 --> 08:01.479
I'm gonna run forever!

08:02.549 --> 08:04.346
Cool!

08:13.527 --> 08:16.985
- Hi. Hey, Nishi!
- Hi!

08:17.297 --> 08:22.428
Nishi! What a surprise! Come sit over here!

08:22.536 --> 08:24.128
Thanks!

08:24.971 --> 08:26.666
Long time no see!

08:26.773 --> 08:31.005
Yang, today's special, and a beer.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.006
Have a drink first!

08:37.017 --> 08:41.010
What've you been up to?
Working on your manga?

08:41.154 --> 08:43.554
Yes! Got a job on the side.

08:43.657 --> 08:47.957
You're going to Tokyo, right? Tokyo's great!

08:48.261 --> 08:54.666
Lots of good looking women trying to make it
in TV and modeling.

08:54.768 --> 08:59.364
When I got married,
I often went there on business!

08:59.472 --> 09:06.810
I'd get invited to hostess bars where there'd
be a bunch of girls like that.

09:06.913 --> 09:12.215
And I'd pick one out and... Yum yum!

09:12.319 --> 09:16.221
Students promoting stuff on the streets,
game show assistants!

09:16.323 --> 09:19.053
- Sir!
- They sure were hot!

09:19.159 --> 09:23.357
- You cheated?
- I was having fun, but they'd fall for me!

09:23.463 --> 09:29.834
I had quite a rep, 5 girls in Tokyo,
3 in Osaka, those were the days!

09:29.936 --> 09:32.666
- Don't listen to him!
- Sorry about this.

09:32.772 --> 09:36.765
Meanwhile, these two popped out...

09:36.876 --> 09:40.812
- You don't sound too thrilled!
- Had to take care of them!

09:40.914 --> 09:43.576
So that was it!

09:44.951 --> 09:50.753
Y'know, if I'd gotten together with
that promo-girl...

09:51.257 --> 09:53.885
I wouldn't be broke now.

09:53.994 --> 09:56.758
Stop dreaming!

09:57.097 --> 09:58.291
That's him.

09:58.398 --> 10:02.129
Yep, dad hasn't changed at all!

10:02.235 --> 10:05.727
His girlfriend's the same age as me!

10:06.373 --> 10:08.204
Picked her up at a loanshark's office!

10:08.441 --> 10:12.673
Riko? She's not quite on par with
the others though!

10:12.779 --> 10:15.907
So you just forgot about her?

10:16.082 --> 10:19.745
What a waste! Like keeping roses in the can!

10:19.853 --> 10:24.813
- What?!
- Your wife! You didn't deserve her!

10:24.958 --> 10:26.949
Why are you taking her side?

10:27.060 --> 10:29.790
'Cause I love the women of the Uchida family!

10:30.864 --> 10:35.824
You were surrounded by
3 of the most beautiful women!

10:35.935 --> 10:40.372
I even planned a trip
to your home town last year!

10:40.473 --> 10:43.033
Thinking the place'll be
swarming with girls like them!

10:43.143 --> 10:45.043
Had to see the source!

10:47.681 --> 10:54.814
Myon, maybe you should marry Nishi.
You'd be happier that way.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.388
What're you talking about?

10:56.489 --> 11:01.119
You love him. You wrote about him
all the time when you were in school!

11:01.227 --> 11:06.631
- Wrote what?!
- Oh, Nishi this, Nishi that, Nishi, Nishi!

11:06.733 --> 11:07.791
Dad!

11:07.901 --> 11:12.395
Ryo's nice too! But I prefer Nishi!

11:14.708 --> 11:15.732
Hi!

11:15.842 --> 11:16.501
Hi!

11:16.609 --> 11:18.406
Ryo.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.340
Sir?

11:20.613 --> 11:22.376
Don't mind him!

11:22.482 --> 11:25.246
This is Nishi.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.384
This is Ryo!

11:27.487 --> 11:32.686
Hi, heard a lot about you! Pleased to meet you!

11:32.792 --> 11:33.759
Same here.

11:33.860 --> 11:34.986
Beer?

11:35.095 --> 11:35.857
Yes!

11:36.096 --> 11:38.656
Did you hear about Kenta's accident?

11:38.765 --> 11:39.789
Yeah.

11:39.899 --> 11:41.491
So please be careful.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.226
Here Nishi!

11:44.504 --> 11:46.438
Thanks!

11:46.539 --> 11:48.939
You create manga, right?

11:49.943 --> 11:52.912
Nishi promised to do one about me!

11:53.012 --> 11:55.572
Yes, something naughty and sexy!

11:55.815 --> 11:56.873
Can't wait!

11:56.983 --> 11:58.143
Stop it!

11:58.251 --> 11:59.684
Something nasty and kinky!

11:59.786 --> 12:01.879
I wanna see that!

12:02.922 --> 12:07.689
<i>Good looking guy, great bod',
seems trustworthy...</i>

12:07.794 --> 12:10.354
<i>But wasn't something a little...</i>

12:10.463 --> 12:13.125
<i>Odd when you came in?</i>

12:13.466 --> 12:18.995
<i>We were talking about ME,
'bout how I'm the one for Myon.</i>

12:19.973 --> 12:25.411
<i>You're in the way, pal, a third wheel,
can't you see it?</i>

12:28.281 --> 12:35.244
I shouldn't embarrass her by competing
with him. Don't want them to feel awkward.

12:35.555 --> 12:38.718
I'll get my truck on the 25th!

12:38.825 --> 12:40.656
Congratulations.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.923
Carries a 5 ton load! I'll be making money!

12:45.198 --> 12:48.964
- You're a truck driver?
- Thanks.

12:49.402 --> 12:53.600
I used to do things like that! Hard stuff!

12:53.706 --> 12:55.833
Had no idea, Nishi.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.536
Well, my body's all I've got going for me!

12:59.612 --> 13:01.443
<i>A real man alright!</i>

13:01.915 --> 13:08.514
<i>Sensitive can mean neurotic. Women are
happier with these rough and simple types!</i>

13:08.888 --> 13:13.416
<i>Nice smile too! I'm history. She's yours!</i>

13:27.073 --> 13:28.335
Hello!

13:41.588 --> 13:42.646
Here!

13:42.856 --> 13:45.689
It'll dry soon!

14:00.907 --> 14:02.534
Something wrong?

14:06.045 --> 14:07.569
Your beer!

14:09.382 --> 14:11.043
Hey!

14:36.376 --> 14:40.142
- You know this guy?
- The owner!

14:42.048 --> 14:49.511
He's off today! I'm only here part-time!
I'm not sure where he is. Sorry.

14:50.256 --> 14:51.587
OK!

15:00.733 --> 15:05.261
Settle down Atsu! We're gonna wait for him!

15:05.705 --> 15:07.935
Right here!

15:09.442 --> 15:13.970
I think he said he was taking
a couple of days off somewhere!

15:20.386 --> 15:24.948
I knew it, off to a holiday resort!

15:25.658 --> 15:31.221
With MY World Cup tickets, having fun.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.335
Stop it! I'll call the police!

15:45.878 --> 15:48.278
Say, you're kinda cute.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.312
What the fuck are you doing, you scum?

16:04.897 --> 16:07.331
And who do you think you are?

16:09.002 --> 16:10.469
Stop it!

16:13.806 --> 16:15.000
Ryo!

16:17.977 --> 16:19.308
Stop it!

16:21.547 --> 16:27.645
Atsu, that's enough, put that piece away!

16:28.521 --> 16:30.250
I said put it away!

16:42.368 --> 16:45.030
- What?!
- You don't know what's going on, bro'!

16:45.138 --> 16:46.833
I do.

16:46.939 --> 16:54.607
No, you don't! My little Riko,
that old fuck, he...

16:54.714 --> 16:57.148
He coerced her!

16:57.316 --> 17:04.654
I know Atsu, but you don't mix business
with private stuff! We're professionals.

17:05.691 --> 17:12.460
Y'know, I've been meaning to tell
you: you've got no taste.

17:12.732 --> 17:22.403
Teen car, fag watch, just plain bad taste.

17:22.508 --> 17:28.413
Me, I'm different, I'm a player!
Not a business man but an artist!

17:28.513 --> 17:30.414
Personal stuff IS my business!

17:30.516 --> 17:35.044
Watch your mouth! You don't even know
the meaning of the word artist!

17:37.690 --> 17:41.717
Oh! Atsu, sorry man,
didn't know you felt that way.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.194
Do whatever you want!

17:44.297 --> 17:48.358
I'm cool, it's just,
I get mad when I think about that guy!

17:48.634 --> 17:51.694
Raping my Riko, keeping her locked in!

17:52.071 --> 17:57.270
Yeah, well if you put it that way,
it's your call!

17:59.045 --> 18:01.741
Say Atsu, can I add something?

18:03.182 --> 18:05.047
NO!

18:15.828 --> 18:23.928
Too bad he's out! He'd understand how I feel,
my hurt, my grief!

18:24.036 --> 18:28.666
If he sees ME raping HIS girlfriend right here!

18:28.774 --> 18:33.905
I don't know this guy,
first time he came in here.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.508
Well it's true!

18:37.150 --> 18:39.584
Bro, this bitch is lying!

18:41.521 --> 18:43.284
You cunt!

18:44.557 --> 18:48.391
They give it up so quickly!

18:48.861 --> 18:51.455
All of 'em!

18:55.368 --> 18:58.895
Wow, great boobs!

19:00.173 --> 19:04.166
Don't move!

19:07.146 --> 19:09.478
That's right, like that!

19:10.683 --> 19:13.550
Shut the fuck up!

19:17.223 --> 19:21.250
Say, those are sexy undies!

19:25.698 --> 19:28.326
Kinda sparse down there, don't move,
show it to me!

19:31.370 --> 19:33.361
Nishi, are you there?

19:36.209 --> 19:37.870
Nishi?

19:38.778 --> 19:43.147
Is he here? Where is he, this way?

19:46.319 --> 19:50.619
This ball couldn't be him, now could it?

19:51.290 --> 19:54.384
Where are you?

19:56.028 --> 20:04.128
This you? Curled up like a ball?
You wanted some, didn't you?

20:04.470 --> 20:09.169
Well, turn around, take a look at that pussy.

20:09.275 --> 20:10.537
You know you want to!

20:10.643 --> 20:15.671
Your turn after, amigo!

20:15.781 --> 20:19.308
Come on, get up and get IT up!

20:20.686 --> 20:22.017
I...

20:22.355 --> 20:23.583
I...

20:23.689 --> 20:26.590
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

20:26.692 --> 20:28.057
Hurt you!

20:33.733 --> 20:35.223
No way!

20:38.371 --> 20:44.367
Ha! Did you hear that, gonna hurt you, he said!

20:44.477 --> 20:48.038
Put a bullet in him, on cue, just when he said,
"Hur!" Out the front before "t!"

20:48.381 --> 20:51.111
Miserable loser!

20:56.889 --> 20:58.789
That's not funny.

21:01.127 --> 21:05.120
I was looking at you, you're gross!

21:05.665 --> 21:07.724
What are you saying bro'?

21:08.501 --> 21:13.302
Too gross. Don't move! You piss me off!

21:13.506 --> 21:16.441
- I'm sorry, forgive me, please!
- Don't move!

21:16.542 --> 21:18.806
I'll do anything!

21:18.911 --> 21:20.310
ATTEN-TION!

21:23.282 --> 21:29.585
Say "shit-pee-dick" 10 times, very fast.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.856
And add a kiss to the last one!

21:33.959 --> 21:35.051
Bro'!

21:35.161 --> 21:38.653
Add a kiss and I'll forgive you!

21:39.432 --> 21:48.340
Shit-pee-dick! Shit-pee-dick!
Shit-pee-dick!

21:48.441 --> 21:51.171
Er, Shit-pee-dick-smack!

21:53.479 --> 21:55.674
You promised!

22:03.456 --> 22:08.553
Think about what you did on your way to hell.

22:10.463 --> 22:15.696
Sorry about the trouble,
but it's the owner's!

22:17.036 --> 22:18.469
Ah, forget it!

22:21.140 --> 22:22.505
I'll have a beer and a stick!

22:52.204 --> 22:55.731
If I only had one of those magic time belts,
turn it back!

23:29.408 --> 23:31.205
<i>"RECAP"</i>

23:31.811 --> 23:34.279
<i>"ANGER BAROMETER"</i>

23:34.380 --> 23:36.211
Nishi, are you there?

23:39.218 --> 23:45.282
Where is he, this way?

23:47.226 --> 23:49.786
This ball couldn't be him, now could it?

23:50.396 --> 23:57.063
This you? You wanted some, didn't you?
Well turn around and...

23:57.603 --> 23:59.002
I...

23:59.104 --> 24:00.537
I...

24:00.639 --> 24:03.301
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

24:03.576 --> 24:05.567
I'm gonna hurt you!

24:56.962 --> 24:58.020
- I'm
- No!

24:58.397 --> 24:59.489
- Gonna
- Stop!

24:59.965 --> 25:01.865
- Hurt you
- Stop, please!

25:25.024 --> 25:29.017
<i>"Sucks, doesn't it?"</i>

25:29.795 --> 25:34.755
<i>"Lame, aren't you?"</i>

25:37.169 --> 25:41.765
<i>"A fart, no?"</i>

25:43.175 --> 25:44.870
<i>"Snot?"</i>

25:44.977 --> 25:52.440
OK, I get it! I'm not cool!
I'm useless! And no fun!

25:52.551 --> 25:55.418
<i>"Bird shit?"</i>

25:55.521 --> 25:58.684
I'm a snot, I know! So, stop this!

25:58.791 --> 26:01.385
Stop! Stop!

26:01.493 --> 26:03.552
STOP!

26:28.087 --> 26:30.248
Something's wrong with my eyes!

26:30.489 --> 26:33.253
I keep changing, right?

26:33.525 --> 26:36.722
You can't decide what I should look like!

26:37.529 --> 26:39.360
Who are you?

26:45.804 --> 26:49.467
You know! It's flickering there in your mind!

26:50.242 --> 26:52.574
Come on, let it go.

26:53.178 --> 26:57.808
What's the first thing that comes to mind?

26:57.916 --> 26:59.907
<i>"G-O-D"</i>

27:00.019 --> 27:02.817
Go... God!

27:02.921 --> 27:06.220
There we are!
Not that how you call me matters!

27:06.325 --> 27:09.658
'A', 'B', they're just symbols anyway!

27:10.496 --> 27:13.431
Confused? Wanna see my tits?

27:13.732 --> 27:20.433
The only way to make it stop is to be honest.
Easier to see the truth that way!

27:20.572 --> 27:26.943
The truth for you, that is!
Too late for counseling though.

27:27.146 --> 27:33.210
Since you're DEAD! What a shame!

27:35.421 --> 27:39.858
Dead! I'm... Dead?

27:41.794 --> 27:43.227
Really?

27:43.595 --> 27:48.623
Just like that? Gone at 20?

27:49.168 --> 27:54.128
Why was I born then?

27:55.974 --> 28:02.880
So you could have fun at my expense?!

28:06.118 --> 28:08.143
What's wrong with that, huh?

28:10.422 --> 28:18.727
Yeah, so I made you on a whim!
I made you, dipshit, for my sheer enjoyment!

28:19.031 --> 28:20.965
What's wrong with that?

28:24.369 --> 28:26.997
Oops, I have to go!

28:27.272 --> 28:30.173
- Got a date!
- A date?!

28:31.410 --> 28:38.407
Time's up. Go straight that way
and keep walking. You'll soon disappear.

28:39.017 --> 28:40.678
And my next life?

28:41.286 --> 28:43.015
- Huh?
- Next life?

28:43.122 --> 28:48.651
Your what? Told you it's over. Start walking!

28:49.528 --> 28:57.025
And disappear? No afterlife? We're done?

28:58.804 --> 29:02.365
It's really over?!

29:03.776 --> 29:07.212
Really, really, really over?! God?

29:10.115 --> 29:16.918
Will you shut up! You saw how you got here,
multiple point of views of your brain exploding.

29:17.389 --> 29:22.417
A shocking documentary of your death,
deftly edited by Moi!

29:23.128 --> 29:28.657
You are DEAD!

29:28.767 --> 29:35.832
I'm officially dead?

29:36.275 --> 29:39.108
Them's the breaks, Nishi.

29:59.464 --> 30:02.092
Straight ahead and disappear!

30:04.269 --> 30:08.831
So if I go the other way...

30:14.813 --> 30:18.305
Hey! What're you doing?! I'll be late!

30:18.884 --> 30:20.442
Wait!

30:20.552 --> 30:23.487
Let me through, I'm going back!

30:24.957 --> 30:26.857
Not down for the count, huh?

30:27.793 --> 30:34.130
You're gonna fade away, that's how it works.
See, you're already fading.

30:38.971 --> 30:42.873
I don't believe you! I'm not gonna disappear!
I'm going back!

30:42.975 --> 30:44.272
Won't happen!

30:44.376 --> 30:48.335
I'll make it, I'll get there, you'll see!

30:51.316 --> 30:56.151
Not bad, can you keep it up?
With that brain? Body?

30:56.421 --> 30:59.822
I'm gonna take care of that creep!

30:59.992 --> 31:03.894
Be stronger! Determined! Free and happy!

31:03.996 --> 31:07.329
Live life to the fullest!

31:11.270 --> 31:12.066
Pretty good!

31:15.407 --> 31:18.308
Alright give it your best shot!

31:18.410 --> 31:23.074
YES! I'm going back! I'm gonna do this!

31:23.181 --> 31:25.877
I'm on your side! I'm on your side!

31:28.253 --> 31:34.886
Your turn after, amigo. Get up and get IT up!

31:38.397 --> 31:42.163
Never! Never!

31:45.003 --> 31:46.698
Never again!

31:50.542 --> 31:51.702
Don't move!

31:58.884 --> 32:00.408
Yang, come here.

32:03.855 --> 32:10.317
I'll blow your head off if you move,
I'm done being the loser!

32:11.630 --> 32:13.222
Give me the car keys!

32:13.799 --> 32:15.596
Nishi!

32:18.704 --> 32:21.798
You're on your own sir, come on, let's roll!

32:21.907 --> 32:22.805
Hey!

32:22.908 --> 32:24.102
Get in!

32:26.445 --> 32:28.436
Wait!

32:31.583 --> 32:33.244
Atsu got wasted!

32:34.553 --> 32:39.786
My fault! They're in my car, we'll get them.

32:39.891 --> 32:43.452
My apologies!

32:54.873 --> 32:57.341
Nishi, watch out!

32:57.609 --> 32:59.509
Help!

33:06.752 --> 33:10.017
And a hero is born!

33:10.122 --> 33:11.851
Hands on the wheel!

33:12.424 --> 33:18.363
Don't worry, I'm on it! I'll protect you!
I love you both!

33:18.597 --> 33:25.594
Moron, eyes on the road! Why are we running?
We should go to the police, self defense, right?

33:25.704 --> 33:32.974
No! No! No! No cops, no questions,
no regrets! I'm through with that!

33:33.078 --> 33:36.514
Making a break for it, with you two!
Like I want!

33:36.615 --> 33:40.642
No one's gonna get in my way!

33:40.786 --> 33:45.280
I'm following my heart's desires!
Like an outlaw!

34:02.140 --> 34:04.904
<i>Hey, can you hear me?</i>

34:05.410 --> 34:12.407
<i>I do hope you realize you were living
in paradise till today.</i>

34:12.818 --> 34:19.849
<i>Like angels flying around in heaven.</i>

34:20.391 --> 34:25.091
<i>But now you're on a super express to hell!</i>

34:29.568 --> 34:37.270
The guy you smoked, that bald SOB, Atsu?

34:37.375 --> 34:45.908
Fine football player and athlete,
known as the Maradona of Osaka!

34:46.618 --> 34:51.146
For good and for bad reasons.

34:51.656 --> 35:00.530
Beautiful bod' like a wild animal!
Not that it has to do with anything.

35:00.799 --> 35:13.275
You knew Atsu was packing, that the car was full of
drugs and money, you knew all that, you planned it.

35:13.378 --> 35:17.337
A clear cut armed robbery and murder case.

35:17.883 --> 35:25.221
His folks abandoned him,
he grew up without love!

35:25.757 --> 35:30.785
Got tickets for the World Cup,
for him and his girl.

35:30.896 --> 35:34.525
A model Japanese footie fan.

35:35.066 --> 35:42.632
But just before the game,
a young guy like you puts out his light.

35:44.042 --> 35:47.569
Ah, the ever-egocentric,
unfeeling youth of today!

35:47.812 --> 35:52.249
<i>Immature adults on the loose,
everything a blur except their friends.</i>

35:52.350 --> 36:03.818
<i>Living life like a video game,
finger on the reset button!</i>

36:03.929 --> 36:08.127
<i>You're a roller-coaster with no breaks!</i>

36:10.268 --> 36:13.328
It's not true, you're making it up.

36:13.538 --> 36:21.172
Typical story, nice and easy
for the cops to follow!

36:22.447 --> 36:28.113
What I'm sayin' is, nobody's on your side!

36:29.087 --> 36:31.817
This is it, kids! Make it a good game!

36:34.993 --> 36:37.393
Nice speech old man.

36:37.495 --> 36:39.429
Will you stop it!

36:40.398 --> 36:46.132
- I can see you sweating in front of a prompter!
- Nishi!

36:46.838 --> 36:48.135
It's improv!

36:49.507 --> 36:50.838
OK!

36:51.309 --> 36:53.038
What?!

36:57.749 --> 37:04.780
This roller-coaster you're trying to stop
is a genuine Angel Express!

37:06.224 --> 37:10.422
And I can see you moved to tears
as you watch that mystic angel!

37:10.528 --> 37:15.056
Spread its wings and disappear into the sky.

37:16.101 --> 37:17.295
The fuck?!

37:41.293 --> 37:42.225
Fuck!

37:53.204 --> 37:54.933
Nishi!

37:55.206 --> 37:56.764
Offside!

38:01.513 --> 38:04.676
Asshole, this ain't football!

38:07.752 --> 38:09.879
Now get in as close as you can!

38:11.089 --> 38:13.216
Offside-trap!

39:15.286 --> 39:17.049
STUNT DRIVING!

39:24.596 --> 39:25.995
My nose is bleeding!

39:26.097 --> 39:26.995
Mine too!

39:27.098 --> 39:28.793
Mine too!

39:29.000 --> 39:31.560
The bridge!

39:41.045 --> 39:43.878
What the fuck are you doing?!

40:05.970 --> 40:08.438
My Pitch, my little pitch!

40:11.242 --> 40:14.973
Pitch! You came back! Pitch!

40:30.762 --> 40:32.593
No more fooling around.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.098
<i>We'll get 'em on the bridge.</i>

40:35.700 --> 40:43.197
Perfect defense plan. Even Zidane and Figo
couldn't get through. We'll get 'em.

41:32.257 --> 41:33.747
Whale?

41:47.372 --> 41:49.272
What, you again?!

41:49.374 --> 41:51.308
Not just yet!

41:53.244 --> 41:55.041
You there, Nishi?

41:55.880 --> 41:58.246
Are we... dead?

41:58.349 --> 42:02.046
You both there? Wait a sec!

42:03.454 --> 42:04.751
Where is it?

42:07.325 --> 42:08.189
Bingo!

42:11.930 --> 42:13.363
We're alive!

42:14.065 --> 42:14.929
Thank God!

42:15.033 --> 42:17.365
Seawater? Can't see shit.

42:18.970 --> 42:20.232
Near the harbour, maybe.

42:20.338 --> 42:22.533
Smells fishy!

42:28.379 --> 42:29.573
Have no fear!

42:29.681 --> 42:34.584
Fear takes the shape we're willing to give it!

42:34.686 --> 42:37.917
Let's light a candle in our hearts,
make it gleam.

42:38.089 --> 42:39.818
Try to enjoy the moment!

42:40.391 --> 42:43.519
In spite of this turn of events.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.426
<i>"This is FUN"</i>

42:45.863 --> 42:49.026
This will shed a new light on things!

42:52.870 --> 42:55.361
Remember our days in grade school?

42:55.773 --> 43:00.972
When it was all play,
no restrictions or tomorrows?

43:01.613 --> 43:04.776
We didn't end up here 'cos we were chased!

43:05.049 --> 43:08.678
We came here seeking adventure!
An epic journey!

43:09.220 --> 43:11.085
Let the party begin!

43:15.059 --> 43:17.721
Hey, there's a boat!

43:20.765 --> 43:22.392
Let's check it out!

43:23.267 --> 43:28.068
Lane No. 1, Nishi! 3rd Grade! And I'm off!

43:32.276 --> 43:33.368
Hey, let's go.

43:36.748 --> 43:41.378
Lane No. 2, Myon!
Also, 3rd Grade, and here I go!

43:58.670 --> 44:00.968
Wow, what a wreck.

44:30.868 --> 44:32.335
Where are we?

44:32.437 --> 44:33.904
Stinks!

44:34.405 --> 44:39.104
I'm starving! Good for my figure, though!

44:39.210 --> 44:41.974
Your body is DOPE!

44:42.080 --> 44:45.516
Which you haven't seen. I just look slim.

44:46.317 --> 44:47.511
Show me then!

44:47.618 --> 44:48.949
No way!

44:49.053 --> 44:50.315
Please!

44:50.421 --> 44:51.183
Nope!

44:51.289 --> 44:52.756
Please!

44:53.524 --> 44:54.718
Sugar on top!

44:54.826 --> 44:55.622
Nah!

44:55.727 --> 45:00.061
- Aw, c'mon!
- Nishi! What now, huh?!

45:00.364 --> 45:02.264
You almost got us killed!

45:02.366 --> 45:05.699
Sure they were scum,
but you also popped a guy!

45:05.937 --> 45:07.802
What's with the "enthusiasm?"

45:09.607 --> 45:13.634
I was killed! Shot by that creep!

45:13.745 --> 45:17.579
What the hell are you talking about?
He's the one that's gone, dodo!

45:17.682 --> 45:22.881
Before that. See, I was so scared
I lucked out on getting angry.

45:22.987 --> 45:25.979
And that's when he shot me! Cueball mother!

45:26.991 --> 45:29.289
Then I was sucked up to heaven and...

45:29.694 --> 45:31.218
You've lost it.

45:31.329 --> 45:35.993
But I believed in myself,
believed like nothing else, and I was back!

45:36.100 --> 45:40.400
To live true to yourself,
sincerely, without restraint!

45:40.505 --> 45:44.908
I realized it's the only weapon
against any wall!

45:47.712 --> 45:51.739
OK, you've lost me.
But THIS is where it got us!

45:51.849 --> 45:54.818
We're only here 'cos we were lucky!

45:55.052 --> 46:00.115
It's a miracle we're alive!
But if this keeps up, we'll be dead in no time!

46:08.566 --> 46:10.534
I... I...

46:12.270 --> 46:13.897
I...

46:16.574 --> 46:20.237
I've got... a radio!

46:22.814 --> 46:23.872
A radio?

46:23.981 --> 46:26.677
This place is dangerous, we need to move!

46:27.018 --> 46:28.576
Hurry! Hurry!

46:29.120 --> 46:33.557
- What the fuck?!
- C'mon, hurry!

46:39.430 --> 46:41.523
- What is this?
- An earthquake? A tsunami?

46:41.632 --> 46:45.966
- You guys are reckless!
- The fuck, old man?!

46:46.070 --> 46:51.337
Hurry up! Grab an ore and row!

46:53.544 --> 46:56.012
- Tidal wave?
- Tsunami!

46:58.049 --> 47:01.416
Move it, people!

47:03.855 --> 47:05.482
Over there!

47:05.590 --> 47:06.750
Almost there!

47:07.158 --> 47:09.524
Hang on!

47:29.146 --> 47:33.048
Meal time's over. We're OK now!

47:34.385 --> 47:35.852
Let's go up!

47:55.439 --> 47:59.500
Wow! It's like a top secret lair!

48:00.945 --> 48:05.507
TV, microwave, audio set, PC,
you've got everything!

48:06.284 --> 48:07.842
So they just washed up?

48:09.720 --> 48:10.914
Ah, and food!

48:13.324 --> 48:17.192
And sexy lingerie! You dirty old man!

48:18.629 --> 48:20.961
Let's see what's inside.

48:22.199 --> 48:26.533
No power, huh?
This stuff's just for show, then?

48:26.704 --> 48:27.932
Gross!

48:28.039 --> 48:29.870
Think of it as modern art!

48:31.642 --> 48:33.940
Want to freshen up?

48:34.378 --> 48:38.508
Plenty of clean hot water?

48:38.616 --> 48:41.585
- You mean have a bath?
- Yes! Yes!

48:42.486 --> 48:43.817
I'd like that!

48:43.921 --> 48:46.549
Yeah? Me too!

49:00.671 --> 49:02.400
This is bliss!

49:04.742 --> 49:09.406
But boy we're in some mess! It's surreal!

49:10.314 --> 49:15.217
I mean, we're in God-knows-where
enjoying a total stranger's hospitality!

49:15.319 --> 49:19.050
Having a bath! Unbelievable.

49:20.958 --> 49:25.292
Well, he's on the way to a Happy Meal,
but he seems nice!

49:58.629 --> 50:01.621
Once a perv, always a perv, huh?

50:02.066 --> 50:06.127
I feel like it's the first time
we're having a real talk.

50:10.307 --> 50:12.867
We'll leave clean clothes here!

50:14.078 --> 50:17.138
Those bastards! Not very subtle are they?!

50:17.248 --> 50:20.445
Let's pretend they're costumes!

50:20.551 --> 50:23.281
Hey, find something we can actually wear!

50:24.855 --> 50:27.016
Wow! Looks amazing!

50:28.325 --> 50:29.815
You made this?

50:30.227 --> 50:31.524
Gramps?

50:31.929 --> 50:33.521
Should've seen him at work!

50:33.631 --> 50:37.761
Really? It's like a NY sushi bar!

50:37.868 --> 50:41.031
Where'd you learn to cook, gramps?

50:46.377 --> 50:48.572
Whoa!

50:51.782 --> 50:53.249
Yeah, it's delicious!

50:53.350 --> 50:54.977
5 stars in my book!

50:55.319 --> 50:57.583
Bon apetit!

50:59.557 --> 51:01.024
Wow.

51:01.125 --> 51:02.387
What a meal!

51:02.493 --> 51:03.926
Thanks!

51:04.028 --> 51:07.862
Much better than some fancy
rotating sushi bar in Kita.

51:08.866 --> 51:13.701
They started serving
Westernized sushi last year.

51:13.804 --> 51:15.567
Rotating sushi bars.

51:16.407 --> 51:19.001
Rotating sushi.

51:19.477 --> 51:21.672
Rotating sushi!

51:21.779 --> 51:23.838
Not like that!

51:25.116 --> 51:26.140
No, no.

51:26.250 --> 51:28.844
In front of the customers.

51:34.625 --> 51:37.116
Mine's dead too!

51:37.828 --> 51:39.796
It's a cell phone?

51:39.897 --> 51:43.458
A phone, a mobile phone?!

51:43.567 --> 51:45.535
I knew it!

51:46.170 --> 51:49.230
So, can we make contact with
the outside world?

51:49.673 --> 51:54.474
Can't! It's soaked! Probably a goner!

51:55.946 --> 52:00.110
So, um, do robots exist now?

52:00.718 --> 52:05.849
I saw a robot aisle at the hardware
store the other day!

52:06.157 --> 52:07.021
Yeah?

52:07.124 --> 52:10.958
Yes! I knew it!

52:14.532 --> 52:17.968
- How about flying cars?
- Huh?

52:19.803 --> 52:22.738
Hmm, how long have you been here exactly?

52:26.143 --> 52:29.579
More than 30 years!

52:31.882 --> 52:34.510
I had a big deal going down!

52:34.618 --> 52:38.019
Hid my stash in a comic book case!

52:42.193 --> 52:44.252
But I took the wrong one!

52:49.500 --> 52:53.334
Coastguards and DEA knew all about it anyway.

52:56.140 --> 53:00.008
Was running, lights flashing everywhere!

53:00.711 --> 53:05.978
When a huge whale swallowed me!

53:06.450 --> 53:07.974
Couldn't believe it.

53:12.523 --> 53:13.888
And then what?

53:14.058 --> 53:17.289
Got caught in the waves!

53:17.995 --> 53:20.896
It was pitch dark when I came around!

53:21.699 --> 53:25.226
Tried to escape but the waves were too rough!

53:25.970 --> 53:28.666
<i>"TIME BOY"
Tried again! And again.</i>

53:30.507 --> 53:35.877
I couldn't have survived without my friends.

53:38.749 --> 53:40.683
Um, where's the toilet?

53:40.784 --> 53:45.187
The washroom? Straight ahead! I'll take you!

53:45.289 --> 53:49.157
Nah, it's okay! Straight ahead, right?

53:56.433 --> 53:57.764
Oh my God!

54:13.217 --> 54:15.117
Hey, keep talking!

54:19.623 --> 54:23.115
- Where's the "exit?"
- All the way down there!

54:23.827 --> 54:25.920
- Oh, right!
- But of course!

54:26.630 --> 54:28.120
Back to square one!

54:28.432 --> 54:32.562
Got to know your own limits!

54:51.555 --> 54:53.318
We're outta here!

54:55.993 --> 54:57.517
We can go this way.

54:59.096 --> 55:01.496
It's wobbling!

55:01.865 --> 55:03.992
It's the only way, c'mon!

55:06.770 --> 55:08.499
It'll be alright!

55:12.242 --> 55:15.040
You'll get killed!

55:15.312 --> 55:17.576
He's hungry again!

55:17.948 --> 55:18.915
Hurry!

55:19.016 --> 55:20.881
Come back!

55:20.984 --> 55:22.417
Wait!

55:22.619 --> 55:25.281
- The water's coming!
- Nishi!

55:28.759 --> 55:30.784
There! The exit!

55:32.596 --> 55:34.826
Put these on!

55:40.671 --> 55:43.265
Nishi! Come back!

55:44.074 --> 55:45.769
Nishi!

56:15.706 --> 56:17.867
Hey, let go of me!

56:17.975 --> 56:21.342
What the?!

56:35.259 --> 56:37.955
Nishi, you're awake!

56:38.295 --> 56:42.288
What a relief! He's come around!

56:43.600 --> 56:47.536
And here's something to cheer you up!

56:47.638 --> 56:49.902
<i>And a "Happy Mornin'" to y'all!</i>

56:50.007 --> 56:51.998
<i>Wow, is this a beautiful day or what?</i>

56:52.109 --> 56:57.672
<i>You wouldn't believe how blue the sky was
this morning.</i>

56:57.781 --> 56:59.681
In line with the solar system!

56:59.783 --> 57:04.243
Thought I'd drive
all the way to Brazil, y'know?

57:04.354 --> 57:07.687
<i>Well, it's gonna be booming
at the resorts today!</i>

57:07.791 --> 57:13.730
<i>Certainly not a day for school
or work, I tell ya!</i>

57:17.134 --> 57:21.798
Now, now, now!

57:22.105 --> 57:24.835
C'mon, cheer up!

57:24.942 --> 57:30.710
You're homesick, I've been there.
I cried and got angry too.

57:30.814 --> 57:33.749
But I realized after coming here!

57:33.851 --> 57:36.581
Oh, whatever!

57:36.820 --> 57:40.017
Got an idea! There's a place
that'll cheer you up.

57:40.123 --> 57:41.784
Great friends too!

57:41.892 --> 57:44.122
Let's go! Everybody!

57:46.363 --> 57:48.092
<i>So wrecked cars are popping up everywhere!</i>

57:48.198 --> 57:51.258
<i>Must've been some monster car chase!</i>

57:51.735 --> 57:54.602
You haven't eaten properly in 3 days!

57:54.705 --> 57:56.798
You're not gonna last that way!

57:56.907 --> 57:59.842
You need to eat for your breasts' sake!

57:59.943 --> 58:02.878
And Nishi, you've eaten nothing!

58:02.980 --> 58:04.971
Forget about getting it up!

58:06.884 --> 58:08.078
Hey!

58:09.353 --> 58:10.752
Just shut up, okay?

58:28.238 --> 58:32.868
Gramps, will you take me to that fun place
you mentioned about?

58:33.277 --> 58:35.745
Wanna go? It'll be fun!

58:36.013 --> 58:37.071
I need a change!

58:37.180 --> 58:40.946
That's the spirit! You'll love it!

58:41.051 --> 58:43.110
Nishi?

58:43.220 --> 58:44.653
You too!

58:45.756 --> 58:48.316
Nah! Count me out!

58:48.425 --> 58:51.417
It'll be fun! You can meet my friends too!

58:51.528 --> 58:54.190
Hearts'll sore! Heads'll explode!

58:54.331 --> 58:57.732
Cut it, Gramps! I'm not in the mood!

58:57.834 --> 58:59.529
Just leave me alone!

59:02.005 --> 59:04.735
Join us later if you feel like it, okay?

59:04.841 --> 59:06.502
Let's go, Myon.

59:06.810 --> 59:08.744
Let's go, let's go!

59:09.046 --> 59:10.707
This'll be a blast!

59:11.181 --> 59:14.173
You'll love my friends.

59:26.763 --> 59:29.960
Fuck! The look on his face!

59:30.067 --> 59:32.297
He doesn't have a clue!

59:32.402 --> 59:36.270
I only said those things
'cos he was being inconsiderate!

59:36.373 --> 59:38.102
How about a little kindness, huh?

59:38.208 --> 59:40.369
I'm hurt!

59:42.079 --> 59:44.206
I have doubts about humanity!

59:46.149 --> 59:48.743
What about my start in manga?!

59:48.852 --> 59:52.117
What about my glorious campus life, huh?!

59:57.394 --> 59:58.452
Asshole!

59:58.562 --> 01:00:00.052
Loser!

01:00:18.382 --> 01:00:21.374
<i>"Help me God I'm sorry"</i>

01:00:26.757 --> 01:00:29.749
<i>30 years! 30 years!</i>

01:01:45.769 --> 01:01:48.169
<i>Gotta drink your milk, honey!</i>

01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:04.718
<i>30 years!</i>

01:02:32.816 --> 01:02:33.748
You okay?

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:36.614
Isn't it amazing, Nishi?

01:02:41.792 --> 01:02:44.192
Gramps, I...

01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:48.628
Er, what I said back there was...

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:55.301
I'd become a bad person!

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:58.374
I wanted to boast about my evil ways.

01:02:58.475 --> 01:03:02.104
I wanted to be known as a tough, rugged man!

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:05.545
I wanted to walk over everybody.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:09.051
But I wound up here and...

01:03:09.553 --> 01:03:11.453
I struggled!

01:03:11.555 --> 01:03:14.683
But I managed to survive!

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.260
I can swim again!

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:22.127
Catch things, walk, see.

01:03:22.666 --> 01:03:24.429
Isn't that fun?

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:30.666
Seawater's salty! This place stinks!
But it gives me joy!

01:03:30.774 --> 01:03:36.110
Would you rather lie around doing nothing?
Or would you rather feel alive?

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:39.073
Which is more fun?

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:08.687
She sure can swim!

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:12.529
She wanted to go to the Olympics
till she was about 15.

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:13.966
Had a coach and all.

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:17.198
Come to think of it,
I remember her winning something!

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:19.400
Bronze at the Kinki Races.

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:22.872
Stopped when her boobs got bigger!

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:25.743
No kidding! Gotta go with the flow, huh?

01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:28.477
Yeah, with the flow!

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:32.485
How is it?

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:38.087
Wow! Fantastic!

01:06:38.194 --> 01:06:41.493
Right, my turn!
Quality entertainment coming up!

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.377
Got one!

01:07:02.485 --> 01:07:04.453
Nishi!

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:45.078
Nishi, remember when we found a stray dog?

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:46.921
In kindergarten?

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:50.287
And you said you'd take care of it?

01:08:50.827 --> 01:08:53.352
That made me so happy!

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:54.930
Yeah?

01:08:55.532 --> 01:08:58.524
I'm gonna take him home with me.

01:08:58.902 --> 01:09:01.462
You will? Thank you!

01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:05.029
I already have a sea-monkey, so it'll be fine!

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:10.673
Wanna see? C'mon, I'll show ya!

01:09:11.214 --> 01:09:12.442
Myon.

01:09:13.683 --> 01:09:15.582
So this is the new plot!

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:18.216
In the far, distant future,

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:22.814
where the world is starving from
over-population and environmental destruction,

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:27.790
Earth decides to send
a spaceship in search of food.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.535
But something goes wrong.

01:09:36.206 --> 01:09:38.197
They land on a strange planet.

01:09:38.308 --> 01:09:43.041
There's water and oxygen,
but nothing edible for humans!

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:49.211
Except for one thing, they soon discover:

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:57.617
A certain creature's pooh.

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:00.126
Oh, gross!

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:03.631
And it's the perfect food for humans.

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:04.894
<i>"It's delicious!"
And it's the perfect food for humans.</i>

01:10:06.903 --> 01:10:10.634
But the creature's unbelievably bad at hunting
and on the verge of extinction!

01:10:10.807 --> 01:10:12.331
There's only one?

01:10:13.643 --> 01:10:17.340
Our men help the creature hunt, look after it!

01:10:17.847 --> 01:10:22.546
And they live like that for a while
until a new enemy arrives.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:28.388
Higher species of plants begin to fight
for food, which is also creature chips!

01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:30.322
A pooh-war, huh?

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:33.920
But what happens then? The crew?

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:39.026
Guess we need to send them home safely, huh?

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:42.993
The planet is ideal in its own way, but...

01:10:44.507 --> 01:10:48.705
In fact, the planet's some kind of cell!

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:52.406
Our crew must've ended up there
after being shrunk!

01:10:52.515 --> 01:10:53.709
A cell?

01:10:53.816 --> 01:10:55.943
Yeah, of a human body.

01:10:56.052 --> 01:10:57.212
Whose?

01:10:57.587 --> 01:10:58.246
Yours!

01:10:58.354 --> 01:10:59.651
Mine?

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:04.382
Let's just say! It was the leader's fault.

01:11:04.961 --> 01:11:10.524
His love for his girl,
his determination to find that planet,

01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:13.761
his desperation led the ship there.

01:11:14.671 --> 01:11:19.267
But one day, they realize
their bodies have grown bigger.

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:20.637
Why?

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:22.108
Wonder why!

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:28.214
And they hear a voice! From inside your tummy
as you're sitting on the toilet.

01:11:28.318 --> 01:11:31.617
"Oh my God!
We're growing bigger and bigger!"

01:11:31.721 --> 01:11:33.552
Yikes!

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:38.252
But they can communicate that way.
And they realize they're inside your stomach.

01:11:38.361 --> 01:11:39.623
- Then what?
- They've gotta get out!

01:11:39.729 --> 01:11:42.459
- From where?
- At this point, they're moving along the colon!

01:11:42.565 --> 01:11:43.793
Not happening!

01:11:44.067 --> 01:11:47.366
But what else can they do?
They keep getting bigger.

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:48.694
Your belly'll explode!

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:51.740
- I said no!
- "We're almost out, don't flush us!"

01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:53.365
I AM flushing them!

01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:55.811
"We're out! We're out!"

01:11:56.713 --> 01:11:58.237
NO!

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:46.682
Myon!

01:13:46.789 --> 01:13:48.484

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:52.357
Nishi! Myon!

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:54.092
We're up here!

01:13:54.197 --> 01:13:55.824
You guys OK?

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:57.559
A- OK!

01:13:58.067 --> 01:14:02.504
I'm relieved! We were worried!

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:06.006
That was a surprise attack! So sudden!

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:28.554
Told ya so! It's wicked, man!
A miracle, I say!

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:32.259
<i>The Other World by Robin Nishi.

01:14:32.902 --> 01:14:37.498

01:14:37.607 --> 01:14:39.006
Roger that.

01:14:39.342 --> 01:14:42.140

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:50.908

Fuckin' cool!

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:04.325
Excuse me, you're Robin Nishi, right?

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:06.594

01:15:09.105 --> 01:15:10.094

01:15:39.569 --> 01:15:41.537
Yes!

01:15:42.438 --> 01:15:44.872
- This is like, your average day?
- Yeah!

01:15:44.974 --> 01:15:48.375
- Awesome!
- I feel so alive!

01:15:48.477 --> 01:15:50.672
Robin, I'll pick up the tab!

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:52.380

01:15:52.481 --> 01:15:53.880
Hiroshi, you idiot!

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:03.013
Hiroshi, kids shouldn't worry
about things like that.

01:16:03.259 --> 01:16:05.352
Have fun and become a man!

01:16:06.162 --> 01:16:09.723

Want to?

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:40.352

01:19:58.544 --> 01:19:59.841
Jump!

01:20:21.433 --> 01:20:25.529
That's odd and it wasn't even time yet.

01:20:28.307 --> 01:20:32.334
Good God! I was about to go fetch you!

01:20:36.315 --> 01:20:37.441
Gramps.

01:20:37.549 --> 01:20:39.210
What's going on?

01:20:44.656 --> 01:20:47.750
The water level's increasing.

01:20:48.594 --> 01:20:51.722
And he's eating less.

01:20:52.164 --> 01:20:53.529
Meaning?

01:20:55.667 --> 01:20:59.899
Can't say for sure, but he could be dying.

01:21:00.506 --> 01:21:04.738
Dying? But what happens to us then?

01:21:05.144 --> 01:21:07.669
Eventually, this place'll sink.

01:21:10.716 --> 01:21:13.776
We've gotta leave. It's that or drown.

01:21:13.886 --> 01:21:15.444
But how?

01:21:15.554 --> 01:21:17.317
The boat, of course!

01:21:17.422 --> 01:21:20.255
- The cops'll be looking for us.
- So?

01:21:20.359 --> 01:21:22.827
The Yakuza'll come after us!

01:21:22.928 --> 01:21:25.522
So what! I wanna get out!

01:21:26.331 --> 01:21:28.060
'Cos there's so much out there!

01:21:28.167 --> 01:21:31.432
So many different people,
living different lives!

01:21:31.537 --> 01:21:34.097
Incredibly good guys, bad guys!

01:21:34.206 --> 01:21:38.267
Folks completely different from us!
It's one huge melting pot!

01:21:38.677 --> 01:21:43.011
See, it's not about success,
dying in the streets, who's better, who's not!

01:21:43.115 --> 01:21:45.345
I just want to be a part of it!

01:21:45.584 --> 01:21:49.076
I realized that even if I've no connections,
no talent,

01:21:49.254 --> 01:21:51.188
even if I'm one big loser,

01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:56.023
I want to use my hands and feet to think
and move, to shape my own life!

01:21:56.728 --> 01:22:00.755
We can just die here or we can try!

01:22:00.866 --> 01:22:03.596
See what we've got!

01:22:06.405 --> 01:22:10.808
It's impossible.
Motivation's not gonna get us over that wave.

01:22:11.243 --> 01:22:12.972
We need a motor boat!

01:22:16.415 --> 01:22:18.042
We've got a motor!

01:22:18.283 --> 01:22:19.682
Right here!

01:22:22.521 --> 01:22:23.988
But there's no fuel!

01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:28.959
Sure there is!
We came here by car, remember?

01:22:34.666 --> 01:22:35.325
Yes!

01:22:35.434 --> 01:22:36.264
It could work!

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:37.665
It will work!

01:22:41.773 --> 01:22:44.173
We're going to make it!

01:22:44.743 --> 01:22:46.677
We're so gonna make it!

01:22:47.679 --> 01:22:48.976

Oh, yeah!

01:23:58.383 --> 01:24:01.784
I think this is our only chance!

01:24:01.987 --> 01:24:06.788
Maybe the whale's come here for us!

01:24:07.025 --> 01:24:08.754
And we're going for it!

01:24:40.592 --> 01:24:43.584
You're older. Lend it to her!

01:24:43.929 --> 01:24:45.226
I don't want to!

01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:46.228
Yang.

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:49.232
Don't run like that, Myon'll follow you.

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:51.063
Sorry, Myon!

01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:55.196
I don't like that uniform!

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:57.474
- I'll work!
- Sorry Yang!

01:25:04.983 --> 01:25:06.041
Wanna try?

01:25:29.007 --> 01:25:31.942
I'm not gonna let you carry
all the load anymore!

I'll grow up.

01:25:35.147 --> 01:25:36.580
I'm sorry.

01:25:36.681 --> 01:25:40.947
I always knew you were the one
that needed support.

01:25:43.955 --> 01:25:47.618
It's your turn now!

01:25:47.993 --> 01:25:50.427

Water striders float!

01:28:11.102 --> 01:28:15.095
Using surface tension
from the hairs on their legs.

01:28:38.129 --> 01:28:38.857
I'm sorry.

01:29:08.226 --> 01:29:11.320
Your bones won't get strong
if you don't drink milk.

01:29:11.429 --> 01:29:12.794
Yes, mom!

01:29:18.637 --> 01:29:21.162
Ah, not again!

01:29:21.806 --> 01:29:23.933
I'll put it in your food then!

01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:20.409
This'll be perfect.

01:33:21.546 --> 01:33:24.310

- The baby!

01:33:24.415 --> 01:33:27.976
- You OK?
- It's heavy!

01:33:28.086 --> 01:33:29.417
There!

01:33:29.921 --> 01:33:33.015
Mmm, too much space for a little kid!

01:33:33.124 --> 01:33:35.115
Ah, he'll be big in no time!

01:33:35.393 --> 01:33:37.691
Wonder what he'll be like.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.600
Be right there, sweetie!
