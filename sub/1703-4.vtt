00:02.469 --> 00:05.302
<i>Air and naval forces</i>
<i>of the United States...</i>

00:05.372 --> 00:08.034
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities-</i>

00:08.108 --> 00:10.941
<i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed</i>
<i>into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:11.011 --> 00:13.741
<i>He has sanctioned</i>
<i>acts of terror in Africa,</i>
<i>Europe and the Middle East.</i>

00:13.813 --> 00:17.112
This will not stand,
this aggression against Kuwait.

00:17.183 --> 00:19.083
<i>...his relentless pursuit of terror.</i>

00:19.152 --> 00:22.883
<i>- We will make no distinction-</i>
<i>- The U.S.S.</i> Cole
<i>was attacked while refueling-</i>

00:22.956 --> 00:24.821
This was an act of terrorism.

00:24.891 --> 00:27.325
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

00:27.394 --> 00:30.921
The next number we're gonna play for you
is one of the good ol' favorites.

00:30.997 --> 00:33.431
...until something stops him.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.264
<i>I-I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

00:38.405 --> 00:41.033
<i>We got a plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:42.409 --> 00:43.967
<i>...thousands of people running-</i>

00:44.044 --> 00:46.342
We must, and we will...

00:46.413 --> 00:47.971
remain vigilant at home and abroad.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.514
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

00:57.824 --> 01:00.019
<i>Fuckl I missed something once before.</i>

01:00.093 --> 01:03.119
<i>I won't- I can't let that happen again.</i>

01:05.364 --> 01:07.959
<i>It was 10 years ago.</i>
<i>Everyone missed something that day.</i>

01:08.034 --> 01:10.696
<i>Yeah, everyone is not me.</i>

01:10.770 --> 01:12.032
<i>Once you've gotten to this position.</i>

01:20.513 --> 01:23.038
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland.

01:23.116 --> 01:26.176
An American prisoner of war
has been turned.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.049
Hello.

01:28.121 --> 01:32.387
<i>Jessica? It's me. Brody.</i>

01:32.459 --> 01:35.895
<i>We need eyes and ears on</i>
<i>Brody from the minute he steps off that plane.</i>

01:35.962 --> 01:37.827
Wait, there's no camera in the garage?

01:37.897 --> 01:41.230
And now he's placing a bag containing
God knows what in our blind spot?

01:41.301 --> 01:43.895
Three days ago,
we were about to tell your kids.

01:43.970 --> 01:45.528
He's my husband, Mike.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.802
I know this is hard, but that's his job
now- to be a public figure.

01:48.875 --> 01:52.208
You know, Mom, it'd be a lot less phony if
you weren't fucking his good friend Mike.

01:52.278 --> 01:54.542
We need Brody in the public eye...

01:54.614 --> 01:56.946
reminding America
that this is far from over.

01:57.016 --> 01:59.541
- How has the homecoming been?
- It's been great.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.610
For all of us.

02:01.688 --> 02:04.316
Five days ago, on Prince Farid's yacht...

02:04.390 --> 02:07.689
the prince's majordomo announces
that the prince has a surprise visitor.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.318
Abu Nazir.

02:09.395 --> 02:12.694
His Highness has a special favor to ask.
A job he wants you to do.

02:12.765 --> 02:15.325
She was D.O.A. At Providence.

02:15.401 --> 02:19.394
Apparently, they had her wearing some
crown jewel type necklace that's vanished.

02:19.472 --> 02:23.340
Maybe Abu Nazir really went on that boat to
talk to someone in the prince's entourage.

02:23.409 --> 02:25.206
<i>You're looking for</i>
<i>a money transfer, right?</i>

02:25.278 --> 02:28.179
<i>Jewelry is the easiest way to move wealth.</i>

02:28.248 --> 02:30.512
400.

02:30.583 --> 02:32.983
- Where did the money go?
- Could be anywhere.

02:33.052 --> 02:35.953
Congratulations.
I hope you'll be happy here.

02:36.022 --> 02:38.456
For us, it's perfect.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:40.553 --> 03:42.953
Service A's today, Marine.

03:43.022 --> 03:44.512
Shirt first.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.787
Green pants.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.125
Khaki tie.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.563
You left it on the back
of the bathroom door.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.608
<i>Hey, Jess, have you seen my tie?</i>

04:02.675 --> 04:04.905
<i>It's in the bathroom, behind the door.</i>

04:24.897 --> 04:26.956
And smile for the cameras.

04:29.936 --> 04:33.133
What can I tell you
that you don't already know?

04:33.940 --> 04:35.805
Not much.

04:35.875 --> 04:40.073
But here goes.
This is what I learned over there.

04:40.146 --> 04:43.411
Friendly fire isn't.

04:43.483 --> 04:46.350
In an ambush, shoot for the knees.

04:46.419 --> 04:48.387
Never lie.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.615
Never leave a man behind.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.649
And if you pick it, it will not heal.

04:55.995 --> 04:58.486
Good luck on your deployment.
Remember your training.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.395
<i>God bless you...</i>

05:00.466 --> 05:01.990
<i>and God bless America.</i>

05:02.068 --> 05:04.434
<i>Go marinesl</i>

05:05.371 --> 05:08.340
Look at him.

05:08.408 --> 05:10.273
Ever since that
Lawrence O'Donnell interview...

05:10.343 --> 05:11.867
it's been like this wherever he goes.

05:11.944 --> 05:14.640
He's been blogged and tweeted about,
offered book deals...

05:14.714 --> 05:18.150
been solicited by
every national talk show.

05:18.217 --> 05:21.675
The vice president tells me you had a hand
in convincing Sergeant Brody...

05:21.754 --> 05:24.018
to go public with his story.

05:25.358 --> 05:26.950
The vice president didn't send...

05:27.026 --> 05:28.687
his chief political operative here...

05:28.761 --> 05:30.524
to thank me for delivering Brody.

05:30.596 --> 05:32.621
You're right.

05:32.699 --> 05:36.135
I came to find out how closely
the public image...

05:36.202 --> 05:38.067
matches the man.

05:38.137 --> 05:40.264
For someone who's been through
what he's been through...

05:40.340 --> 05:43.309
Sergeant Brody seems remarkably composed.

05:43.376 --> 05:45.867
Are you asking me
if he's emotionally stable?

05:45.945 --> 05:47.776
Is he?

05:49.148 --> 05:51.048
I'm not a psychiatrist.

05:51.117 --> 05:55.213
But you ordered his psych evaluation in
Germany, which I'm sure you reviewed.

05:55.288 --> 05:58.257
So, if we look under the hood,
what would we find?

05:58.324 --> 06:01.088
Well, we weren't exactly vetting him
for national office.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.288
That is why you're here, isn't it?

06:04.364 --> 06:08.391
In the most preliminary sense.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.663
Then again,
if his psychological profile checks out...

06:10.737 --> 06:13.205
and his politics are correct...

06:13.272 --> 06:15.035
why not?

06:15.108 --> 06:18.271
I sure know a lot of folks who would
open their checkbooks to him right now.

06:21.748 --> 06:25.013
Sorry to interrupt, sir,
but Saul Berenson is outside.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.587
Tell him I'll be right out.

06:30.656 --> 06:33.625
I'm sorry, Ms. Gaines,
but I need to take this.

06:33.693 --> 06:37.254
My colleague has never learned
how to take no for an answer.

06:37.330 --> 06:41.733
The vice president remembers well your
conversation regarding a directorship.

06:41.801 --> 06:47.171
Any information you could give us on
Sergeant Brody would be... much appreciated.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.265
- How much longer is he gonna be?
- He'll be right with you.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.867
Did you tell him I have an operational
protocol for him to sign off on?

06:51.944 --> 06:53.844
Sir, right now he's in a meeting with-

06:55.648 --> 06:57.878
- Lizzie.
- Saul.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.720
- We'll see ourselves out.
- Nice to meet you.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.815
Major.

07:08.127 --> 07:11.153
So, tell me what's so important
that it couldn't wait.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.323
Abu Nazir, David. Remember him?

07:13.399 --> 07:16.459
Two horns, long tail,
a strong scent of sulfur?

07:16.536 --> 07:19.198
I think we found out
how he's financing his attack.

07:19.405 --> 07:23.102
This is a photograph of the prince's
chief aide, Latif bin Walid...

07:23.176 --> 07:25.508
taken nine hours
after Lynne Reed was killed.

07:25.578 --> 07:28.741
And the necklace she was wearing
that the police reported as stolen-

07:28.815 --> 07:30.908
we believe it was in this package.

07:30.983 --> 07:33.474
You're saying that was the money transfer
we've been looking for?

07:33.553 --> 07:35.487
It's a working theory.

07:35.555 --> 07:39.389
Hard to believe Latif would park a half
a million dollars in some Laundromat.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.428
Not when that Laundromat's
doubling as a <i>hawala</i> broker.

07:42.495 --> 07:46.022
Hundreds of millions move through
these informal networks every day.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.464
And because they're based
on an honor code, there are no records...

07:48.534 --> 07:51.435
which makes financial transactions
nearly impossible to track.

07:51.504 --> 07:53.631
Yeah, but <i>hawala</i> systems
are typically used...

07:53.706 --> 07:57.972
to transfer funds across borders,
internationally, not as dead drops.

07:58.044 --> 08:01.536
What you're suggesting
is pretty unorthodox, isn't it?

08:01.614 --> 08:04.378
Abu Nazir is always unorthodox. That's why
he's still out there.

08:04.450 --> 08:06.782
Our friends at the Bureau
have ongoing surveillance...

08:06.853 --> 08:09.219
of the five known <i>hawala</i> operations
in the metro area.

08:09.288 --> 08:13.190
That's where we got
this photo of Latif at the Laundromat.

08:13.259 --> 08:16.626
Since then, 51 customers
have come and gone.

08:16.696 --> 08:20.792
One of them may have the necklace
or its cash equivalent.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.358
One of them may have
the money that Abu Nazir is using...

08:23.436 --> 08:25.529
to fund an attack on American soil.

08:25.605 --> 08:29.234
Why not just ask the guy who runs
the place which one came for the necklace?

08:29.308 --> 08:31.367
Same reason we're not extraditing Latif.

08:31.444 --> 08:34.470
Arrests at this time
would be of negative value.

08:34.547 --> 08:37.880
We don't want to spook Abu Nazir before
we know how many others he's activated.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.712
Lynne Reed was killed three weeks ago.

08:39.784 --> 08:42.116
That means we're three weeks
behind the bad guys.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.588
Which is why we need to initiate
an operation immediately.

08:44.657 --> 08:46.818
Work up files on all these people.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.727
Do it.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.059
All right. You heard him.

08:54.133 --> 08:56.158
Let's start putting everybody
through facial recognition...

08:56.235 --> 09:00.103
cross-referencing with I.N.S., D.M.V. -
every database we've got.

09:00.172 --> 09:04.472
And once that happens, we'll split into
five two-person teams and run 'em down.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.739
That means background checks,
limited surveillance...

09:06.812 --> 09:09.747
selective face time with family,
friends, employers.

09:30.336 --> 09:32.702
Okay. I gotta go. Bye.

09:32.772 --> 09:35.036
Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

09:35.107 --> 09:37.541
The FISA warrant expires tomorrow.

09:37.610 --> 09:40.670
- If you're asking me
to try and extend it, don't.
- At least hear me out.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.044
I had to drag a skeleton
from Judge Turner's closet...

09:43.115 --> 09:45.106
to get you those four weeks
in the first place.

09:45.184 --> 09:47.744
- I know what you did.
- And you still haven't
produced a single lead...

09:47.820 --> 09:51.153
connecting Sergeant Brody
to this or any plot against America.

09:51.223 --> 09:52.884
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.984
It just means he may be
laying low for a while.

09:55.061 --> 09:58.121
Turned and trained, but a sleeper.

09:58.197 --> 10:01.064
You're arguing against yourself, Carrie.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.795
We can't watch him indefinitely.
You know it.

10:03.869 --> 10:05.496
- But, Saul-
- Listen to me.

10:05.571 --> 10:07.698
Listen carefully.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.298
This intelligence
your asset gave up her life to acquire-

10:10.376 --> 10:12.310
Do not squander it
by continuing to invade...

10:12.378 --> 10:15.006
the constitutionally protected
privacy of the Brody family.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.242
It's not an either-or proposition.

10:17.316 --> 10:20.444
The money we're tracking is connected
to Brody. I just haven't found out how.

10:20.519 --> 10:22.851
If you're right, the money will eventually
lead back to him.

10:22.922 --> 10:25.390
But until then,
you need to take down that surveillance.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.052
First chance you get, you will remove
the cameras and microphones...

10:28.127 --> 10:30.357
from Sergeant Brody's house
and cover your tracks.

10:30.429 --> 10:32.397
Are we clear?

10:41.674 --> 10:44.165
I'm just saying.
They were a bunch of kids.

10:44.243 --> 10:46.905
They're marines, and they were looking
at you like a rock star.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.243
Not because I was
a P.O.W. For eight years.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.773
Because my face has been plastered
all over TV for the last three weeks.

10:52.852 --> 10:56.811
Whatever the reason,
your visit meant a lot to them, Brody.

10:56.889 --> 10:58.720
Well, I'll take your word for it.

10:58.791 --> 11:01.259
- Good. I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

11:03.162 --> 11:06.188
Hey. You hungry?
I think we have steaks on the grill tonight.

11:06.265 --> 11:08.756
Thanks. I'm good. I'm just gonna grab
something on the way home.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.927
- You sure you don't want to come in?
- Yeah.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.698
Why not?

11:12.772 --> 11:18.870
Mikey, all I'm saying is, for the last two
weeks, you've hardly come by once.

11:18.944 --> 11:22.277
I've been driving your ass around every
day. I figured you'd be sick of me by now.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.316
See, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

11:24.383 --> 11:28.786
Every time I invite you into the house,
you make up some lame-ass excuse.

11:31.557 --> 11:35.823
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think you were avoiding us.

11:37.096 --> 11:39.326
Hey, I just figured-

11:39.398 --> 11:41.332
I thought I'd give you some space.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.927
I mean, let you be alone with your family
without me getting in the way.

11:46.939 --> 11:48.668
Well, I appreciate that, Mike.

11:48.741 --> 11:50.971
You looking out for the family.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.806
And for Jessica.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.369
Like you did while I was gone.

11:57.283 --> 11:59.808
You'd have done the same for me.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.815
You know what?

12:05.157 --> 12:07.250
I'm not sure I would have.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.832
I'll see you tomorrow, Mike.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.935
All right.

12:38.224 --> 12:40.192
What's so interesting?

12:40.259 --> 12:42.284
There, in the woods.

12:45.064 --> 12:47.089
See the antlers?

12:47.867 --> 12:49.767
It's an eight-point buck.

12:49.835 --> 12:54.534
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah- until it tramples
those tulips you planted.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.704
- How'd it go with the recruits?
- Great.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.404
Good.

12:59.478 --> 13:01.742
Yeah. When's dinner?

13:03.015 --> 13:04.642
Whenever you want.

13:04.717 --> 13:08.414
Okay. Well, we need some more propane.

13:11.323 --> 13:14.383
Don't worry, honey.
Probably just had a bad day.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.725
Forget it. Doesn't matter.

13:19.899 --> 13:22.094
Come on. Let's go wash up.

13:32.211 --> 13:34.202
Are the kids asleep?

13:39.985 --> 13:42.579
Well, then, what are you waiting for?

14:33.539 --> 14:35.837
Yo, wild man.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.103
Cut that shit out.
You're gonna miss the war.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.258
Come on. Tuck in your shirt.

16:03.195 --> 16:05.390
Dana. She's waiting in the car.

16:06.665 --> 16:09.327
- Did you see the flowers?
- I did.

16:09.401 --> 16:12.495
- I told you.
- I'll put out some soap flakes.

16:12.571 --> 16:14.505
Soap flakes?

16:14.573 --> 16:16.598
Yeah. The deer think
they're smelling people.

16:16.675 --> 16:20.577
If that doesn't work, we can build a fence.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.615
Build a fence- there's an idea.

16:23.682 --> 16:25.775
Maybe Mike could do it. He's pretty handy.

16:32.958 --> 16:36.052
Carrie, are you ready?

16:38.931 --> 16:41.058
Come on. We don't have all day.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.431
They're only gonna be at church
for like an hour and a half.

16:43.502 --> 16:46.232
Rolling up this operation
is a fucking mistake.

16:49.508 --> 16:52.238
- You don't agree?
- It's not like we have a choice.

16:52.311 --> 16:54.370
Saul said that he would have
my head on a stick...

16:54.446 --> 16:56.380
and parade it out in front
of the inspector general.

16:56.448 --> 16:59.417
Yeah, but what do you think? I mean, you've
been watching Brody as long as I have.

16:59.485 --> 17:00.975
You must have an opinion.

17:01.053 --> 17:03.453
Look. We've been on him for a month,
and we've come up empty.

17:05.790 --> 17:08.259
Wh-What about Max?
What does Max think?

17:08.327 --> 17:11.819
He thinks the wife is hot, okay? Come on.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.062
I have been looking all over for you.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.795
- Just a second. I-
- We're done here. It's time to go.

20:11.777 --> 20:14.940
- You ready?
- There's one camera left.

20:15.013 --> 20:16.981
Thought I'd let you do the honors.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.500
Hey. How are you?

20:40.572 --> 20:42.665
- Good.
- Hey, buddy.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.301
- That was a beautiful service.
- Yes, sir. It was.

20:45.377 --> 20:47.345
Sergeant, this is Elizabeth Gaines.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.937
She's one of the vice president's
closest advisers.

20:50.015 --> 20:51.983
It's an honor to meet you, Sergeant Brody.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.644
This happened yesterday?

20:55.721 --> 20:58.383
- When I dropped him off.
- What did he say exactly?

20:58.457 --> 21:00.516
He asked why I haven't been
coming around the house.

21:00.592 --> 21:04.187
I told him I didn't want to intrude.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.527
- Think Dana said something?
- No.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.532
Maybe we should just go ahead
and tell him ourselves.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.966
What we should have done is tell him
right away when he first got back.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.526
Now it's turned into this big lie.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.368
Your story has inspired
a nation in need of inspiration.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.635
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

21:17.709 --> 21:19.734
I asked Major Foster to introduce us...

21:19.811 --> 21:22.575
because there's something
I'd like to discuss with you.

21:22.648 --> 21:24.843
May I take you to lunch next week?

21:26.351 --> 21:27.841
Yes, ma'am.

21:27.919 --> 21:30.149
Don't drive yourself crazy.

21:33.091 --> 21:35.855
I just think that maybe we should...

21:35.927 --> 21:40.057
try to find a way for us all to be together
again without feeling so damn awkward.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.227
We're having some people over
tomorrow night.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.107
Good. Good. I'll be there.

21:51.109 --> 21:52.406
Hey.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.570
We've barely spoken in three weeks.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.547
I'm kind of- I'm worried about you.

21:59.918 --> 22:01.886
I'm fine.

22:01.953 --> 22:04.080
Tell me.

22:05.891 --> 22:07.381
It's just-

22:08.827 --> 22:10.317
He's so-

22:12.531 --> 22:14.829
- What?
- Nothing.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.629
Jessica, I want to know.

22:25.444 --> 22:27.912
Work permit expires
at the end of November.

22:27.979 --> 22:30.072
Lives with two roommates in Tenleytown.

22:30.148 --> 22:32.082
Single mother back in Jakarta.

22:32.150 --> 22:35.642
So she's sending money home, which
explains her visit to the <i>hawala</i> broker.

22:35.721 --> 22:39.487
Personal references all check out,
and I called up her supervisor at Exotech.

22:39.558 --> 22:43.426
- Mm-hmm.
- Diligent, super bright,
star of his I.T. Department.

22:43.495 --> 22:45.292
All right. Moving on.

22:47.332 --> 22:49.732
- Where's Carrie?
- Oh, she should be here soon.

22:49.801 --> 22:51.792
She said she was running late.

22:52.838 --> 22:55.306
- She say why?
- No, sir.

22:57.642 --> 22:59.473
How well do you know her?

22:59.544 --> 23:02.069
I'd like to think we're friends.

23:02.147 --> 23:06.049
I understand she's a bit of a folk hero
to some of you analysts.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.848
Well, we've all read the cables, sir,
heard the stories.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.455
With you it's more than that, isn't it?

23:12.524 --> 23:14.355
You want to do what she does.

23:14.426 --> 23:19.193
- It's no secret I've put in for Operations.
- Three years in a row.

23:19.264 --> 23:22.097
You know, you don't look like a Galvez.

23:22.167 --> 23:24.226
I take after my mother, sir.
She's Lebanese.

23:24.302 --> 23:26.167
- And your father?
- Guatemalan.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.035
They met at the D.M.V.

23:28.106 --> 23:31.200
My mom refused to
take off her head scarf for the photo...

23:31.276 --> 23:34.177
and my dad was the guy taking the pictures.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.147
- America.
- Yes, sir.

23:37.215 --> 23:41.345
- Your file says you're fluent in Arabic.
- And Spanish, sir.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.878
You know, there might be something
opening up in the Cairo station.

23:44.956 --> 23:48.517
My recommendation would carry weight.

23:48.593 --> 23:52.620
Which brings us back to Carrie Mathison.

23:52.697 --> 23:54.824
I didn't put you with her by accident.

23:56.468 --> 23:58.265
I don't understand.

23:58.336 --> 24:02.864
During a debrief, Carrie mentions
Abu Nazir's name out of the blue.

24:02.941 --> 24:07.571
Three days later, one of her assets reports
the first Nazir sighting in over seven years.

24:07.646 --> 24:09.705
Maybe it's coincidence.

24:11.016 --> 24:14.042
Or maybe there's something
she's just not telling us.

24:16.354 --> 24:18.322
You want a taste of Operations?

24:18.390 --> 24:21.882
Find out if she's running
something on the side.

24:25.597 --> 24:27.565
Sir, I-

24:27.632 --> 24:30.567
I'm not sure I-I'm comfortable with-

24:30.635 --> 24:32.227
Spying?

24:35.540 --> 24:38.566
I'm making sure there are no loose cannons
rolling around on my deck...

24:38.643 --> 24:42.238
because if there are,
I need to tie them down.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.456
- Hey, Carrie.
- David, hi.

24:51.523 --> 24:53.957
Sorry I'm late.

24:54.025 --> 24:55.754
What was that all about?

24:55.827 --> 24:59.957
Uh, he wanted to review the, uh,
Jalbani file before he cleared it.

25:00.031 --> 25:04.263
So we're on to the next case.

25:04.336 --> 25:09.000
Raquim Faisel,
assistant professor at Bryden University.

25:17.415 --> 25:20.316
That woman you were
talking to at church today- who is she?

25:20.385 --> 25:22.717
Oh, she works for the vice president.

25:22.787 --> 25:26.382
- Works for him how?
- Some kind of adviser.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.926
What did she want?

25:29.895 --> 25:31.886
She wants to have lunch with me.

25:31.963 --> 25:35.729
- Why?
- No idea.

25:40.739 --> 25:43.367
I invited Mike over tomorrow night.

25:43.441 --> 25:46.137
He knows most of the people
who are coming, so-

25:46.211 --> 25:48.679
No, it's a great idea, Jess.
The more the merrier.

25:56.154 --> 25:59.123
I better go check on Chris,
make sure he's doing his homework.

26:30.355 --> 26:32.118
Yeah?

26:32.190 --> 26:34.181
What happened to you?
You just disappeared.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.454
I had some personal stuff to take care of.

26:36.528 --> 26:38.462
- Off campus?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

26:40.999 --> 26:45.436
Well, uh, okay, listen. I just, uh,
finished running background on Faisel.

26:45.503 --> 26:48.995
Listen to this. Three trips to Lahore
in the last 18 months.

26:49.074 --> 26:51.042
- <i>For what purpose?</i>
- Unclear.

26:51.109 --> 26:53.077
<i>I put in a call to Pakistani intelligence.</i>

26:53.144 --> 26:54.839
Oh, I don't trust those fuckers.

26:54.913 --> 26:57.575
Make some appointments at the university,
find out what you can.

26:57.649 --> 27:01.745
And tomorrow, you and I will spend
some quality time with our professor.

27:16.201 --> 27:20.763
You know, it's customary to wait for someone
to say "Come in" before you actually come in.

27:20.839 --> 27:23.399
You didn't say anything
to your father, did you?

27:24.409 --> 27:26.604
About what?

27:30.181 --> 27:31.739
No, I didn't.

27:31.816 --> 27:34.444
- 'Cause if you did-
- Ma, I didn't say a word.

27:36.721 --> 27:39.451
Jesus, it's like
the Spanish Inquisition around here.

27:39.524 --> 27:41.515
I believe you, okay?

27:55.507 --> 27:57.475
What are you doing, Ma?

27:58.877 --> 28:01.141
I'm sitting on your bed.

28:01.212 --> 28:02.907
Well, yeah, I can see that.

28:02.981 --> 28:06.246
- Is that a crime?
- No.

28:06.317 --> 28:08.979
- Not exactly.
- What, then?

28:14.659 --> 28:16.627
Is something wrong?

28:18.063 --> 28:19.553
No.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.496
Are you guys gonna get a divorce?

28:28.907 --> 28:31.740
No. We're not getting divorced.

28:35.447 --> 28:39.349
'Cause if you are, I just want you
to know that... I'm cool with it.

28:39.417 --> 28:41.681
I just think you guys
should do whatever's best for you.

28:41.753 --> 28:44.586
Dana, no one's getting a divorce, okay?

28:44.656 --> 28:47.250
Okay.

28:51.296 --> 28:53.321
You should probably tell Chris that.

28:53.398 --> 28:58.301
'Cause he's, like, totally certain you and
Dad are gonna ruin his life or something.

29:06.611 --> 29:08.545
Rumor or fact?

29:08.613 --> 29:10.638
What, me and Estes?

29:10.715 --> 29:12.706
Why are you so interested all of a sudden?

29:12.784 --> 29:15.048
I don't know.
I keep hearing you guys had a thing once.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.987
Is it any of your business?

29:24.095 --> 29:25.960
We had a moment.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.864
Misguided. Ancient history now.

29:30.935 --> 29:33.870
- What?
- I was on the wrong side of that bet.

29:35.874 --> 29:37.967
Why? Does it seem so unlikely?

29:38.042 --> 29:40.408
Kind of.

29:40.478 --> 29:43.413
Well, he was the smartest
guy in the Near East Division by a mile.

29:43.481 --> 29:47.383
It's not that. It's just I don't see
a lot of love lost between you two.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.881
- It didn't end well.
- Does it ever?

29:51.956 --> 29:53.150
Ah-

29:57.128 --> 29:59.096
That's our guy.

30:23.454 --> 30:25.547
I thought you said
he lived in Truxton Circle.

30:25.623 --> 30:27.113
He does.

30:27.192 --> 30:29.353
Not headed there now.

30:35.233 --> 30:36.894
Hello?

30:36.968 --> 30:39.334
- <i>Where is he?</i>
- It's after 4:00.

30:39.404 --> 30:42.805
- He should be on his way here.
- <i>Tell him the traffic</i>
<i>is bad on the Beltway.</i>

30:42.874 --> 30:45.866
- What did you say?
- <i>He should use an alternate route.</i>

30:45.944 --> 30:48.139
<i>Tell him now.</i>

31:28.186 --> 31:31.314
Guy hasn't broken the speed limit once.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.914
Does that make him
more or less suspicious?

31:34.692 --> 31:36.683
Makes him boring as shit.

31:36.761 --> 31:38.729
We tailed him all afternoon.
After class...

31:38.796 --> 31:41.788
he drove to a Moroccan restaurant
near the airport, where he dined alone.

31:41.866 --> 31:43.800
Second team's outside his apartment now.

31:43.868 --> 31:46.996
His briefcase looked full,
so my guess is he's in for the night.

31:47.071 --> 31:50.563
- What's he an assistant professor of?
- Mechanical engineering.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.576
Tenure track. Generally liked.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.703
- Published, peer-reviewed.
- Muslim?

31:54.779 --> 31:57.077
Yeah, but not a Koran thumper.
Worships at Kalid Muhammud.

31:57.148 --> 31:59.013
What about those three trips to Pakistan?

31:59.083 --> 32:01.381
Lecturing at the University of Lahore.
It all checks out.

32:01.452 --> 32:05.354
He was delivering a series of papers
on alternative energy applications.

32:05.423 --> 32:08.654
All right. Then see what second team
comes up with tonight.

32:08.726 --> 32:10.489
If nothing, move on.

32:13.398 --> 32:15.332
Hey, uh, whose birthday is it again?

32:15.400 --> 32:17.231
I think it's Mitchell's.

32:17.302 --> 32:18.997
- I'm gonna go buy him a drink.
- Sure.

32:19.070 --> 32:22.039
- How about you? You want another?
- Uh, no. I should go.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.631
Stay... and visit.

32:25.343 --> 32:27.311
Visit?

32:27.378 --> 32:29.107
Why not?

32:31.783 --> 32:33.717
Why are you being nice to me?

32:33.785 --> 32:35.252
Do I need a reason?

32:35.320 --> 32:38.915
Not unless you want me
to believe a word you're saying.

32:40.158 --> 32:41.887
All right.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.587
Okay.

32:43.661 --> 32:47.563
It occurs to me that I've been holding
on to the idea of being angry at you...

32:47.632 --> 32:50.123
rather than actually being angry at you.

32:52.503 --> 32:58.499
Just so we're clear, are we talking about
Baghdad or what happened pre-Baghdad?

32:59.877 --> 33:01.504
Both.

33:01.579 --> 33:04.742
Did you just get diagnosed with cancer
or something, David?

33:04.816 --> 33:08.081
You see? It's a habit for you too.
Neither of us can get past it.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.888
Past what exactly?

33:11.956 --> 33:14.550
Our period of distrusting each other.

33:14.625 --> 33:18.755
Well, that could have been
pretty much any time, couldn't it?

33:21.199 --> 33:23.133
I don't know about that.

33:31.175 --> 33:33.837
Well, if I never said it, I'll say it now.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.114
I'm sorry, David.

33:40.718 --> 33:44.017
Just so I'm clear, are we talking about
Baghdad or what happened pre-Baghdad?

33:44.088 --> 33:47.182
Both. Both.

33:47.258 --> 33:50.227
- But mostly pre.
- I can't believe I chased you
up to New York like that.

33:50.294 --> 33:52.489
No, I never should have
left in the first place.

33:52.563 --> 33:54.463
You deserved an explanation.

33:54.532 --> 33:57.524
I don't know.
I might have run away from me too.

33:57.602 --> 33:59.832
If I had known your marriage
would break up, David-

33:59.904 --> 34:01.462
No, no.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.633
The truth is it was probably over anyway.

34:08.746 --> 34:10.976
How is Victoria?

34:11.516 --> 34:13.108
Remarried-

34:13.184 --> 34:15.947
to a nice Jewish guy from Fort Lauderdale-
a doctor.

34:16.020 --> 34:17.851
She and the kids converted last year.

34:17.922 --> 34:20.254
You're kidding me. Victoria?

34:22.726 --> 34:25.889
Well, mazel tov.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.831
So how's it been?

34:37.909 --> 34:40.070
Mmm.

34:40.143 --> 34:43.476
- It's been tough. I won't lie.
- Well, at least he's home.

34:43.547 --> 34:46.415
Joanie's husband is still over there,
and she only gets to talk to him...

34:46.484 --> 34:48.815
once a month on the sat phone
when he's back at battalion.

34:48.886 --> 34:50.683
Yeah.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.780
How's the sex?

34:53.524 --> 34:56.049
I know.

34:56.127 --> 34:57.856
It's awful, right?

34:57.929 --> 34:59.954
More like nonexistent.

35:00.031 --> 35:02.864
- Dennis couldn't get it up for almost a year.
- Really?

35:02.934 --> 35:05.869
- Oh, yeah.
- What about drugs, like Viagra or whatever?

35:05.937 --> 35:08.997
No, the problem
wasn't between his legs. It's-

35:09.073 --> 35:13.169
Have I ever been with an impotent man?
I don't think so.

35:13.244 --> 35:16.145
Well, you haven't lived.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.813
Mmm. Ooh.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.545
Oh, uh, looks like they might be-
Hang on.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.952
Oh, there she is. Hey, Jess.

35:25.022 --> 35:26.922
- Hi.
- This is Demmie. Demmie, Jessica.

35:26.991 --> 35:28.253
Jessica, Demmie.

35:28.326 --> 35:30.317
Debbie, nice to meet you.

35:30.394 --> 35:31.861
It's Demmie.

35:31.929 --> 35:33.419
With two M's.

35:34.966 --> 35:38.026
Demmie. Come in.
Let me get you guys something to drink.

35:50.648 --> 35:54.084
- Where'd you find her?
- It was short notice, all right?

36:01.225 --> 36:03.352
- So where's Brody at anyway?
- I don't know.

36:03.427 --> 36:06.294
I haven't seen him for a little while.
I have no idea where he is.

36:06.364 --> 36:09.197
- Want me to go find him?
- That'd be great. Thanks.

36:09.267 --> 36:10.825
All right.

36:21.579 --> 36:23.809
I'll be right back.

36:34.992 --> 36:36.857
Brody.

36:43.768 --> 36:45.395
Brody?

36:45.469 --> 36:48.836
- So when are you going back to work full time?
- This week, I think.

36:48.906 --> 36:51.397
That'll be good.
Get you out of the house a little more.

36:51.475 --> 36:54.069
Are you hungry? I am starving.

36:56.681 --> 36:57.978
Brody?

37:00.151 --> 37:01.812
Brody?

37:04.255 --> 37:06.189
What's going on? Is everybody all right?

37:06.257 --> 37:09.192
Looks like the soap flakes
didn't really work, Jess.

37:09.260 --> 37:12.491
- I killed the deer.
- Give me the gun, Brody.

37:12.563 --> 37:14.428
- Back off, Mike.
- Mom.

37:14.498 --> 37:18.161
Go back inside, Chris.
Everything's gonna be fine.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.932
Come on, Chris.
Let's go inside. It's gonna be okay.

37:21.005 --> 37:23.530
You know what, Mike? I can handle this.
Can you please just tell everybody to go home?

37:23.608 --> 37:26.168
- No, I'm not leaving you alone.
- Just go, please.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.871
Do what she says, Mike.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.642
Make sure Chris stays inside.
I don't want him coming back out here.

37:33.718 --> 37:35.777
Chris? Why? What's the problem?
What do you think I'm gonna do?

37:35.853 --> 37:38.583
I don't think you're gonna do anything.

37:38.656 --> 37:40.317
All right.

37:40.391 --> 37:43.883
I'm gonna go get a shovel, clean up
this beast before the flies get to it.

37:43.961 --> 37:46.896
Goddamn it!
Don't walk away from me, Brody.

37:46.964 --> 37:50.195
He was eating all your flowers,
for Christ's sake. What's the big deal?

37:50.268 --> 37:53.066
You fired a weapon.

37:53.137 --> 37:56.334
In front of our friends,
in front of our son.

37:56.407 --> 37:58.375
You want to believe
that's normal, go right ahead.

37:58.442 --> 38:00.205
- There's nothing wrong with me.
- Is that right?

38:01.512 --> 38:03.070
You barely sleep...

38:03.147 --> 38:06.014
you turn your back on your friends,
you scare your children.

38:06.083 --> 38:08.551
- I mean, you won't even-
- Say it.

38:08.619 --> 38:10.348
You can't even fuck your wife.

38:15.493 --> 38:17.324
We need help, Brody.

38:18.729 --> 38:20.629
I see what this is.

38:20.698 --> 38:23.064
Time for me to get my head shrunk,
go to Psych Services?

38:23.134 --> 38:26.900
I don't give a shit who you talk to, as
long as you talk to somebody.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.462
What if I say no?

38:32.143 --> 38:34.941
Then I can't do this anymore.

39:48.586 --> 39:50.952
There's no point in imagining the worst.

39:51.021 --> 39:53.353
I'm not imagining.
They followed me to this house.

39:53.424 --> 39:55.858
They followed you <i>past</i> this house.

39:55.926 --> 39:58.793
Darling, I promise,
no one knows we're living here.

39:58.863 --> 40:00.990
- How can you be so sure?
- Because if they did...

40:01.065 --> 40:03.363
they'd be tearing apart the living room,
not driving by outside.

40:03.434 --> 40:06.631
No. I still think we should leave.

40:06.704 --> 40:08.604
Our instructions were to sit tight.

40:10.574 --> 40:14.533
In the meantime,
we owe it to ourselves not to panic.

40:16.347 --> 40:18.281
You have a class to teach.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.579
In less than an hour.

40:20.651 --> 40:23.176
It's important that you do
exactly what you always do-

40:23.254 --> 40:25.347
go to work.

40:30.494 --> 40:32.621
We knew this would not be easy.

40:57.188 --> 40:59.122
All right.

41:11.569 --> 41:14.766
- Who's next?
- Sheikh Eyad Hassoun.

41:14.839 --> 41:18.240
He's a groundsman for the Islamic House
on Constitution Avenue.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.038
- Any red flags?
- It depends.

41:20.110 --> 41:22.772
- On what?
- What you consider a red flag.

41:22.847 --> 41:27.045
He was arrested 12 years ago
for refusing to leave an un-permitted rally.

41:27.117 --> 41:28.846
What was he protesting?

41:28.919 --> 41:31.581
The presence of U.S. Troops
in Saudi Arabia.

41:33.457 --> 41:37.553
All right. Start with his immigration
status. I-I'll be right back.

41:37.628 --> 41:39.596
- Any luck?
- Not yet.

41:39.663 --> 41:42.063
Keep laboring in the vineyards.
Something will turn up.

41:42.132 --> 41:44.999
What I wouldn't give right now
for a little retail intelligence.

41:45.069 --> 41:48.766
Disenchanted imam,
an Islamist kid halfway to the bomb belt.

41:48.839 --> 41:51.501
A live source. That'd be nice.

41:51.575 --> 41:53.440
Anything else on your Christmas list?

41:54.345 --> 41:56.040
Yeah.

41:57.815 --> 42:01.307
Let me put Virgil and Max back on Brody,
but this time we leave no footprint.

42:01.385 --> 42:04.047
- Just a light tail. Two 12-hour shifts.
- No.

42:04.121 --> 42:06.749
But we're following
all these other targets.

42:06.824 --> 42:09.987
In case you hadn't noticed, there's a lot
of political heat on the good sergeant.

42:10.060 --> 42:12.255
Now more than ever,
we need to keep our distance.

42:13.631 --> 42:15.656
I know it's hard.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.166
I can't help but feel
I'm missing something.

42:19.236 --> 42:20.760
You're missing him.

42:22.406 --> 42:24.806
When you're on somebody all the time,
it's like that.

42:24.875 --> 42:27.070
You know that as well as anybody.

42:27.144 --> 42:29.669
He's in your rearview now, Carrie.

42:29.747 --> 42:31.738
You're moving in another direction.

42:34.051 --> 42:35.848
Understood?

42:38.289 --> 42:40.223
Yeah.

43:47.524 --> 43:49.014
Hey.

43:49.093 --> 43:51.391
Are you all right?

43:51.462 --> 43:54.863
Yeah. Just watching the storm.

43:54.932 --> 43:56.923
Oh, yeah?

43:57.001 --> 43:59.094
Is it coming or going?

43:59.169 --> 44:00.898
Hard to tell.

44:02.206 --> 44:03.867
Coming, I think.

44:07.511 --> 44:09.172
You want to join me?

44:10.948 --> 44:13.280
I was just getting ready to go.

44:16.220 --> 44:17.847
There's a, uh-

44:17.921 --> 44:20.754
There's a veterans support group meeting
at the church tonight.

44:22.559 --> 44:24.049
Okay.

44:24.128 --> 44:27.962
Thought I'd-
Thought I'd drop in and just try it out.

44:29.199 --> 44:30.689
Okay.

44:33.303 --> 44:36.431
- Thank you.
- Yeah, don't thank me yet.

44:36.507 --> 44:39.533
I don't think I'm gonna be able to
stomach it for more than about five minutes.

44:44.148 --> 44:46.844
Well, let's get you an umbrella,
just in case.

46:08.632 --> 46:10.862
Stay away from the milk. Spoiled.

46:11.769 --> 46:14.135
Thanks.

46:18.942 --> 46:21.308
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Hey, no worries. No worries.

46:23.080 --> 46:24.911
Hey, I know you.

46:24.982 --> 46:27.348
- You were in the debrief at-
- Please.

46:27.417 --> 46:31.080
- What?
- It's just I'm- I-

46:31.922 --> 46:33.822
I'm not supposed to be here.

46:33.891 --> 46:35.791
Why not?

46:35.859 --> 46:37.622
Okay. Seats, everybody.

46:37.694 --> 46:39.457
- Time to begin.
- Oh, shoot.

46:42.733 --> 46:44.223
Hey.

46:48.672 --> 46:50.196
Hey, wait.

46:51.542 --> 46:53.032
Hey, wait.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.135
Wait. Wait.

46:56.213 --> 46:59.239
Look. I'm sorry. I really had no idea
you were in this group.

46:59.316 --> 47:01.876
I'm not. It's my first time.

47:01.952 --> 47:03.943
Well, then, I'll leave you to it.

47:04.021 --> 47:06.046
Hey. Hold on. Hold on a second.

47:06.123 --> 47:08.023
What'd you say your name was again?

47:08.091 --> 47:11.117
Carrie. Carrie Mathison.

47:11.195 --> 47:14.926
Look. I don't understand.
It's, uh- What's the problem?

47:14.998 --> 47:17.558
- It's totally fine with me if you want to stay.
- No, it's not that.

47:17.634 --> 47:20.296
It's just, uh, no one in there can know
what I do for a living.

47:20.370 --> 47:22.133
I'm still an active intelligence officer.

47:23.073 --> 47:25.064
Your secret's safe with me.

47:27.110 --> 47:30.807
Besides, I'm better at spilling my guts
to total strangers anyway.

47:30.881 --> 47:33.577
I hardly ever go to
the same meeting twice.

47:33.650 --> 47:35.049
Sounds complicated.

47:37.387 --> 47:39.548
You all right?

47:39.623 --> 47:41.318
Are you?

47:43.961 --> 47:46.122
Anyway, you should go back in.
They're getting started.

47:46.196 --> 47:48.824
Look. I'm not going back in if it means
you can't go back in.

47:48.899 --> 47:51.732
Please. Really.
That's- That's not necessary.

47:51.802 --> 47:55.795
Maybe we can hold our own private meeting
out here. How's that sound?

47:57.641 --> 47:59.575
It's tempting.

47:59.643 --> 48:01.133
Right?

48:05.949 --> 48:07.746
Can I ask you a question?

48:07.818 --> 48:09.183
Sure.

48:09.253 --> 48:11.346
Where was it you said you served again?
Baghdad?

48:11.421 --> 48:13.252
Yeah.

48:17.594 --> 48:21.587
How come it's so hard to talk about
with people who weren't there?

48:24.167 --> 48:26.192
I have a better question.

48:26.270 --> 48:30.297
How come it's so hard to talk with anyone
who wasn't there about anything at all?

48:38.048 --> 48:40.516
Okay, now I really am going.

48:40.584 --> 48:42.643
Don't leave me like this.

48:42.719 --> 48:45.882
All alone, in the rain.

48:45.956 --> 48:48.049
You'll be fine.

48:48.125 --> 48:52.152
Nobody expects you to say anything
till the second or third meeting anyway.

48:52.229 --> 48:55.198
Well, that's assuming
I get to the second or third meeting.
