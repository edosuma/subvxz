SGT. STANLEY MARSH
IS TRAPPED BEHIND
ENEMY LINES.

00:42.489 --> 00:43.721
HIS ONLY CHANCE
OF SURVIVAL

00:43.723 --> 00:47.592
IS TO SNEAK PAST THE BOSNIAN
GUARD WHO STANDS WATCH.

00:48.061 --> 00:50.061
SGT. MARSH KNOWS
IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

00:50.063 --> 00:52.463
HE MUST MAKE
A RUN FOR IT.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.333
THE AMERICAN BASE
IS ONLY A FEW FEET AWAY...

00:55.335 --> 00:58.236
(shouting in
foreign language)

00:58.238 --> 01:01.072
(all imitating
gunfire)

01:01.608 --> 01:04.709
IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN
YOUR WEAK AMERICAN WEAPONS

01:04.711 --> 01:05.977
TO DESTROY ME.

01:05.979 --> 01:08.279
CARTMAN, WE SHOT
YOUR BOSNIAN FAT ASS!

01:08.281 --> 01:09.280
YEAH, YOUR DEAD!

01:09.282 --> 01:11.783
I HAVE CLASS-4
ARMOR ON THAT--

01:11.785 --> 01:12.850
NO, YOU DON'T!

01:12.852 --> 01:15.987
SPECIAL ARMOR
THAT'S IMPENETRABLE
TO AMERICAN BULLETS.

01:15.989 --> 01:19.123
DUDE, EVERY TIME WE PLAY
AMERICANS VS. BOSNIANS,

01:19.125 --> 01:19.958
YOU CHEAT!

01:19.960 --> 01:21.125
YEAH CARTMAN,
YOU SUCK.

01:21.127 --> 01:22.727
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY
AMERICANS VS. BOSNIANS ANYMORE,

01:22.729 --> 01:24.929
YOU CAN JUST
PLAY WITH YOURSELF.

01:25.465 --> 01:28.099
THAT'S FINE,
I LIKE PLAYING WITH MYSELF.

01:28.101 --> 01:30.401
I'LL PLAY WITH MYSELF
ALL DAY LONG.

01:30.403 --> 01:32.203
HA, HA, HA...

01:32.205 --> 01:32.704
WHAT?

01:32.706 --> 01:34.138
WELL, NOW WHAT ARE
WE GOING TO DO?

01:34.140 --> 01:35.006
I DON'T KNOW.

01:35.008 --> 01:36.174
HI, STAN.
HI, WENDY.

01:36.176 --> 01:38.743
KYLE, DOESN'T BEBE
LOOK PRETTY TODAY?

01:38.745 --> 01:39.811
I DON'T KNOW.

01:39.813 --> 01:41.679
SHE DOES, SHE LOOKS
VERY PRETTY.

01:41.681 --> 01:42.680
OKAY.

01:42.682 --> 01:45.850
STAN, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

01:50.256 --> 01:53.891
STAN, WOULDN'T IT BE FUN IF
WE FIXED KYLE UP WITH BEBE?

01:53.893 --> 01:54.692
NO.

01:54.694 --> 01:55.860
IF BEBE AND KYLE
WERE A COUPLE,

01:55.862 --> 01:57.862
THEN WE COULD INVITE THEM OVER
TO YOUR CLUBHOUSE FOR DINNER,

01:57.864 --> 02:00.465
AND PLAY PARLOR GAMES AND
HAVE MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS

02:00.467 --> 02:02.066
AND SIP COGNAC
BY THE FIREPLACE.

02:02.068 --> 02:02.934
WE COULD?
YES, STAN!

02:02.936 --> 02:05.570
BUT, DUDE, I DON'T
HAVE A CLUBHOUSE.

02:05.572 --> 02:06.170
YOU DON'T?

02:06.172 --> 02:07.638
I THOUGHT ALL GUYS
HAD CLUBHOUSES.

02:07.640 --> 02:09.741
JUST HOW MANY
GUYS' CLUBHOUSES
HAVE YOU BEEN IN?

02:09.743 --> 02:13.711
CARTMAN DON CARTMAN HAS WAYS
OF MAKING YOU TALK.

02:13.713 --> 02:15.246
(farting)

02:15.248 --> 02:16.914
STAN, YOU HAVE TO
BUILD A CLUBHOUSE,

02:16.916 --> 02:18.616
THEN ALL FOUR OF US
COULD SIT IN IT

02:18.618 --> 02:20.785
AND PLAY
"TRUTH OR DARE".

02:21.521 --> 02:22.553
TRUTH OR DARE, WOW!

02:22.555 --> 02:24.589
COME ON, KYLE,
WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

02:24.591 --> 02:25.189
WE DO?

02:25.191 --> 02:26.424
WE'RE GONNA
BUILD A CLUBHOUSE.

02:26.426 --> 02:27.825
I HAVE TO ASK
MY DAD FOR HELP.

02:27.827 --> 02:28.926
DID IT WORK?

02:28.928 --> 02:30.194
I THINK IT DID, BEBE.

02:30.196 --> 02:31.362
IF ALL GOES
AS PLANNED,

02:31.364 --> 02:33.097
KYLE WILL BE
YOUR NEW BOYFRIEND!

02:33.099 --> 02:34.198
I HOPE SO, WENDY.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.834
HE'S GOT SUCH
A HOT ASS!

02:39.372 --> 02:40.738
HEY, PHILLIP,
PULL MY FINGER.

02:40.740 --> 02:42.106
ALL RIGHT,
TERRENCE.

02:42.108 --> 02:43.107
UGH!

02:43.109 --> 02:44.475
OH WAIT,
PULL HARDER.

02:44.477 --> 02:45.710
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

02:45.712 --> 02:46.911
UGH!

02:46.913 --> 02:47.845
HA, HA HA,
HA, HA.

02:47.847 --> 02:49.580
DAMN IT, PULL REALLY
HARD, PHILLIP.

02:49.582 --> 02:50.515
OKAY.

02:50.517 --> 02:52.050
WAIT, UGH, UGH...

02:52.052 --> 02:55.219
OH BOY!

02:55.221 --> 02:58.456
UGH, UGH, UGH, UGH...

02:58.458 --> 03:00.858
WAIT, WAIT... UGH..

03:00.860 --> 03:02.126
(farts)

03:02.128 --> 03:03.661
HA, HA,
GOT YOU THERE.

03:03.663 --> 03:05.129
UH, OH,
HA, HA, HA.

03:05.131 --> 03:06.631
OH, YOU GOT
ME, TERRENCE.

03:06.633 --> 03:08.166
YES, I SURE DID.

03:08.168 --> 03:09.867
WHOA DUDE, YOUR
DAD IS WATCHING

03:09.869 --> 03:10.968
TERRENCE AND PHILLIP.

03:10.970 --> 03:12.837
NO, I WAS JUST FLIPPING
THROUGH THE CHANNELS.

03:12.839 --> 03:15.473
HEY, DAD, WE NEED TO
BUILD A CLUBHOUSE.

03:15.475 --> 03:16.240
OKAY.

03:16.242 --> 03:17.008
HOW DO
WE DO IT?

03:17.010 --> 03:18.743
YOU JUST GET A
HAMMER AND SOME WOOD.

03:18.745 --> 03:21.012
DO SOME GIRLS WANT TO PLAY
TRUTH OR DAY OR SOMETHING?

03:21.014 --> 03:22.313
YEAH, DUDE,
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

03:22.315 --> 03:23.714
HOW DO YOU THINK
I MET YOUR MOTHER?

03:23.716 --> 03:25.049
RANDY, MY
WEDDING RING.

03:25.051 --> 03:27.185
I LOST IT DOWN
THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL!

03:27.187 --> 03:28.219
OH BROTHER.

03:28.221 --> 03:30.121
HA, HA, HA.

03:30.123 --> 03:32.857
STANLEY, I THOUGHT
I TOLD YOU NOT TO WATCH

03:32.859 --> 03:34.092
THIS HORRIBLE
CARTOON.

03:34.094 --> 03:36.194
YEAH, STANLEY,
YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

03:36.196 --> 03:36.761
DUDE!

03:36.763 --> 03:40.364
HERE, STANLEY, YOU WATCH NICE
CARTOONS LIKE "FAT ABBOT".

03:40.366 --> 03:41.332
AHH.

03:41.334 --> 03:44.769
RANDY, WILL YOU PLEASE COME GET
MY WEDDING RING OUT OF SINK!

03:44.771 --> 03:46.070
OKAY, OKAY.

03:46.072 --> 03:48.372
HEY, HEY, HEY,
WHAT'S GOING ON, RUDY?

03:48.374 --> 03:50.308
MAN, FAT ABBOT,
YOU NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT.

03:50.310 --> 03:52.910
I LOSE WEIGHT WHEN
I FEEL LIKE IT, BITCH!

03:52.912 --> 03:54.979
SHUT YOUR
BITCH-ASS MOUTH, HO'!

03:54.981 --> 03:56.514
BITCH?
I'LL KICK YOUR ASS!

03:56.516 --> 03:57.648
WHOA DUDE!
SWEET!

03:57.650 --> 04:00.952
YOU THINK YOU'RE SLICK,
YOU PUNK-ASS, BLASPHEMOUS,

04:00.954 --> 04:02.053
DOPE-FIEND, BITCH.

04:02.055 --> 04:04.088
I HAD MY JIMMY WACKED
SEVEN TIMES LAST WEEK.

04:04.090 --> 04:06.290
I'LL BUST A CAP
IN YOUR (bleep) ASS SHIT.

04:06.292 --> 04:08.759
WOW, CARTOONS ARE
GETTING REALLY DIRTY.

04:08.761 --> 04:10.128
DID YOU FIND IT?

04:10.130 --> 04:11.696
GIVE ME A SECOND,
WOULD YOU?

04:11.698 --> 04:12.864
DON'T SNAP
AT ME!

04:12.866 --> 04:14.031
I DIDN'T
SNAP AT YOU.

04:14.033 --> 04:15.333
YOU SNAPPED
AT ME!

04:15.335 --> 04:16.367
WHATEVER.

04:16.369 --> 04:17.301
WHATEVER?

04:17.303 --> 04:19.203
IN 15 YEARS,
YOU'VE NEVER SAID
"WHATEVER" TO ME.

04:19.205 --> 04:21.205
I DON'T WANT FIGHT,
I'M SORRY.

04:21.207 --> 04:22.306
I'M SORRY TOO.

04:22.308 --> 04:23.474
I THINK
I FOUND IT.

04:23.476 --> 04:25.176
THAT'S NOT IT,
YOU IDIOT!

04:25.178 --> 04:26.844
HEY, BACK OFF,
BITCH!

04:26.846 --> 04:29.747
YOU JUST SAID
THE "C" WORD!

04:29.749 --> 04:30.681
DID I?

04:30.683 --> 04:33.551
THIS IS A SWEET SPOT
FOR A CLUBHOUSE.

04:33.553 --> 04:34.585
YEAH, HEY STAN,

04:34.587 --> 04:35.753
WHAT DID YOUR DAD
MEAN WHEN HE SAID

04:35.755 --> 04:36.787
WE'RE GONNA PLAY
TRUTH OR DARE?

04:36.789 --> 04:38.890
OH, UH, JUST THAT MAYBE
WHEN WE'RE FINISHED,

04:38.892 --> 04:41.159
WENDY AND BEBE CAN
COME OVER AND PLAY.

04:41.161 --> 04:42.960
DUDE, WHAT KIND OF
SICK JOKE IS THAT?

04:42.962 --> 04:44.028
GIRLS SUCK ASS.

04:44.030 --> 04:45.296
WELL, OF COURSE,
THEY DO, BUT...

04:45.298 --> 04:47.999
BUT WOULDN'T IT BE SWEET TO
PLAY TRUTH OR DARE WITH THEM?

04:48.001 --> 04:48.799
WHAT, WHY?

04:48.801 --> 04:51.536
BECAUSE, DUDE, WE COULD MAKE
THEM DO REALLY GROSS STUFF

04:51.538 --> 04:52.436
LIKE EAT BUGS.

04:52.438 --> 04:53.738
HEY, YEAH,
THAT WOULD BE SWEET!

04:53.740 --> 04:55.239
WE COULD TOTALLY
RUIN THEIR LIVES!

04:55.241 --> 04:56.874
WHAT ARE YOU
GUYS DOING?

04:56.876 --> 04:58.576
WE'RE BUILDING
A CLUBHOUSE.

04:58.578 --> 05:00.278
HA, HA, A CLUBHOUSE?

05:00.280 --> 05:01.779
THAT'S THE LAMEST THING
I'VE EVER HEARD.

05:01.781 --> 05:03.314
IT'S NOT LAME,
IT'S SWEET.

05:03.316 --> 05:04.615
AFTER WE BUILD
THIS CLUBHOUSE,

05:04.617 --> 05:06.484
WE'RE GOING TO GET GIRLS
TO PLAY TRUTH OR DARE.

05:06.486 --> 05:07.585
WHY?

05:07.587 --> 05:10.988
BECAUSE, DUMB-ASS, WE CAN
DARE THEM TO DO GROSS STUFF

05:10.990 --> 05:11.722
AND MAKE THEM CRY.

05:11.724 --> 05:12.790
WHAT, WERE YOU
BORN YESTERDAY?

05:12.792 --> 05:13.891
YEAH, NOW BEAT IT
YOU GUYS.

05:13.893 --> 05:15.159
THIS CLUBHOUSE
IS PRIVATE.

05:15.161 --> 05:15.893
THAT'S FINE.

05:15.895 --> 05:17.295
WE'LL BUILD
OUR OWN CLUBHOUSE.

05:17.297 --> 05:18.062
FINE.

05:18.064 --> 05:20.164
FINE, AND THEN WE'LL GET GIRLS
TO PLAY TRUTH OR DARE TOO.

05:20.166 --> 05:21.165
FINE.

05:21.167 --> 05:22.300
FINE.

05:22.302 --> 05:23.401
FINE.

05:23.403 --> 05:25.236
FINE!

05:30.043 --> 05:31.576
NO, KENNY,
YOU CAN'T LOOK.

05:31.578 --> 05:32.577
I'M THE FOREMAN.

05:32.579 --> 05:33.644
(mumble, mumble)

05:33.646 --> 05:35.880
BECAUSE, KENNY,
YOUR FAMILY'S POOR.

05:35.882 --> 05:37.481
YOU HAVE TO BE
THE WORKER.

05:37.483 --> 05:38.382
NO, KENNY!

05:38.384 --> 05:40.084
HOW'S THE TREEHOUSE
COMING ALONG, HON?

05:40.086 --> 05:42.486
MOM, IT'S NOT
A TREEHOUSE,
IT'S A CLUBHOUSE!

05:42.488 --> 05:43.454
SORRY, HON.

05:43.456 --> 05:46.524
MOM, CAN WE PULL UP
THE CARPETING IN
THE LIVING ROOM?

05:46.526 --> 05:48.359
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, ERIC.

05:48.361 --> 05:50.461
IF YOU DID THAT, THEN
THE FLOORS WOULD BE BARE.

05:50.463 --> 05:56.167
BUT MOM, THE BLUEPRINT SAYS WE
NEED CARPETING IN THE CLUBHOUSE!

05:56.169 --> 05:57.235
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

05:57.237 --> 05:58.603
KENNY, MY MOM SAYS YOU CAN
GO GET CARPETING

05:58.605 --> 05:59.704
IN THE LIVING ROOM NOW.

05:59.706 --> 06:01.572
(mumble, mumble)

06:01.574 --> 06:04.542
AND STOP
YOUR BITCHIN'!

06:05.245 --> 06:06.811
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING, SWEETHEART?

06:06.813 --> 06:07.511
GETTING A COOKIE.

06:07.513 --> 06:09.046
WE'RE BUILDING A CLUBHOUSE
AND THEN WE'RE--

06:09.048 --> 06:10.248
YOU MEN ARE
ALL ALIKE.

06:10.250 --> 06:12.383
FIRST YOU GET A COOKIE
AND THEN YOU CRITICIZE
THE WAY I DRESS

06:12.385 --> 06:13.684
AND THEN IT'S
THE WAY I COOK.

06:13.686 --> 06:15.319
I SUPPOSE NEXT
YOU'LL BE TELLING ME

06:15.321 --> 06:16.454
THAT YOU
NEED YOUR SPACE

06:16.456 --> 06:18.289
AND THAT I'M SABOTAGING
YOUR CREATIVITY.

06:18.291 --> 06:23.227
GO AHEAD, STANLEY, GET YOUR
GODDAMN COOKIE!

06:23.229 --> 06:23.961
'KAY.

06:23.963 --> 06:25.029
(school bell ringing)

06:25.031 --> 06:29.600
AND SO, CHILDREN, TODAY
WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON
AMERICAN HISTORY.

06:29.602 --> 06:30.401
RIGHT MR., TWIG?

06:30.403 --> 06:31.669
THAT'S RIGHT,
MR. GARRISON.

06:31.671 --> 06:33.104
AMERICAN HISTORY IS VERY--

06:33.106 --> 06:34.538
WHEN IS MR. HAT
COMING BACK?

06:34.540 --> 06:35.673
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

06:35.675 --> 06:36.907
WHEN IS MR. HAT
COMING BACK?

06:36.909 --> 06:40.211
I TOLD YOU TO NEVER TO MENTION
THAT NAME IN MY CLASSROOM AGAIN.

06:40.213 --> 06:41.912
MR. HAT IS A
TWO-TIMING WHORE,

06:41.914 --> 06:43.714
AND NOW WE ALL
LEARN FROM MR. TWIG!

06:43.716 --> 06:45.082
BUT MR. TWIG SUCKS.

06:45.084 --> 06:46.050
YEAH!
YEAH!

06:46.052 --> 06:47.184
THAT IS ENOUGH!

06:47.186 --> 06:48.986
MR. HAT IS GONE AND
HE ISN'T COMING BACK!

06:48.988 --> 06:50.288
AND I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT!

06:50.290 --> 06:54.025
ANYWAY CHILDREN, LET'S TURN OUR
HISTORY TEXTBOOKS TO PAGE 105,

06:54.027 --> 06:55.359
WHICH WOULD BE RIGHT AFTER...

06:55.361 --> 06:57.361
SO, HOW'S YOUR LAME-ASS
CLUBHOUSE, STAN?

06:57.363 --> 06:58.729
BETTER THAN
YOURS, FAT BOY.

06:58.731 --> 06:59.930
WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT.

06:59.932 --> 07:01.365
DON'T FORGET YOU NEED TO
CUT SCHOOL EARLY

07:01.367 --> 07:02.767
AND WAIT FOR
THE HOT TUB GUY.

07:02.769 --> 07:03.734
UH-HUH.

07:03.736 --> 07:05.202
IS THE CLUBHOUSE READY?

07:05.204 --> 07:06.037
ALMOST.

07:06.039 --> 07:07.305
STAN, ARE YOU
PAYING ATTENTION?

07:07.307 --> 07:08.472
YES, MR. GARRISON.

07:08.474 --> 07:12.310
WELL THEN, STANLEY,
WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

07:12.312 --> 07:12.843
UM...

07:12.845 --> 07:16.113
YOU SAID THAT EVEN THOUGH
CHARO APPEARED 12 TIMES ON
"THE LOVE BOAT",

07:16.115 --> 07:18.816
THE EPISODE WITH
"CAPTAIN AND TENNILLE"
GOT HIGHER RATINGS.

07:18.818 --> 07:23.721
WELL, OKAY, I SUPPOSE
YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION.

07:23.723 --> 07:25.356
ANYWAY, CHILDREN...

07:25.358 --> 07:26.590
GOOD GUESS, DUDE.

07:26.592 --> 07:27.591
PHEW!

07:27.593 --> 07:29.126
PSSST,
PASS THIS UP.

07:29.128 --> 07:30.528
PASS THIS UP.

07:30.530 --> 07:31.762
PASS THIS UP.

07:31.764 --> 07:32.763
PASS THIS UP.

07:32.765 --> 07:36.367
STANLEY, ARE YOU
PASSING NOTES TO KYLE?

07:36.369 --> 07:37.368
NO, I JUST--

07:37.370 --> 07:38.636
DON'T LIE, STAN,
LYING MAKES YOU STERILE.

07:38.638 --> 07:40.237
I'M NOT LYING,
SOMEONE JUST
HANDED ME--

07:40.239 --> 07:41.739
STANLEY, IF YOU THINK
IT'S SO IMPORTANT

07:41.741 --> 07:42.773
TO KEEP INTERRUPTING
MY CLASS,

07:42.775 --> 07:44.141
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
COME UP TO THE FRONT

07:44.143 --> 07:46.544
AND READ YOUR NOTE TO KYLE
FOR EVERYONE TO HEAR?

07:46.546 --> 07:47.912
BUT I DIDN'T
WRITE THE NOTE.

07:47.914 --> 07:49.980
MR. GARRISON, STAN'S
BEHAVIOR IS HAVING AN

07:49.982 --> 07:52.283
ADVERSE AFFECT ON
MY EDUCATION.

07:52.285 --> 07:53.484
SHUT UP, CARTMAN!

07:53.486 --> 07:56.120
STANLEY MARSH, YOU COME UP HERE
RIGHT NOW AND READ YOUR NOTE!

07:56.122 --> 07:58.522
OH MAN!

08:00.159 --> 08:02.660
"DEAR KYLE, YOU HAVE GOT
SUCH A GREAT ASS.

08:02.662 --> 08:06.464
"I COULD SLEEP FOR DAYS ON THOSE
PERK CHEEKS, LET ME TELL YOU.

08:06.466 --> 08:07.665
"I'D LIKE TO
LIVE WITH YOU

08:07.667 --> 08:11.635
AND WEAR YOUR ASS
AS A HAT FOR ALL ETERNITY."

08:11.637 --> 08:16.040
WHOA, DUDE!

08:16.042 --> 08:17.274
NOW, YOUNG MAN,

08:17.276 --> 08:19.977
SCHOOL IS A TIME
FOR LEARNING, OKAY.

08:19.979 --> 08:21.979
NOT FOR IMMATURE
SKY-LARKINGS.

08:21.981 --> 08:23.147
WHAT'S "SKY LARKINGS"?

08:23.149 --> 08:24.882
YOU KNOW, LIKE
"TOM FOOLERIES".

08:24.884 --> 08:26.016
WHO?
(knock on door)

08:26.018 --> 08:27.518
OH, YOUR
PARENTS ARE HERE.

08:27.520 --> 08:28.419
OH NO.

08:28.421 --> 08:29.820
THANK YOU FOR COMING
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

08:29.822 --> 08:32.890
I WAS JUST DISCIPLINING
YOUR SON FOR HIS SKY LARKINGS.

08:32.892 --> 08:37.294
STANLEY I--
SKY LARKINGS?

08:37.296 --> 08:38.129
OKAY?

08:38.131 --> 08:39.530
STANLEY, I WANT YOU
TO EXPLAIN TO ME

08:39.532 --> 08:41.232
WHY YOU WERE
PASSING NOTES IN SCHOOL.

08:41.234 --> 08:42.433
RANDY, LET ME
HANDLE THIS.

08:42.435 --> 08:43.868
NOW, STANLEY,
I WANT YOU
TO EXPLAIN TO ME

08:43.870 --> 08:46.003
WHY YOU WERE
PASSING NOTES
IN SCHOOL.

08:46.005 --> 08:47.304
IT WASN'T
MY NOTE, DUDE.

08:47.306 --> 08:48.105
IT WAS SOME GIRL'S.

08:48.107 --> 08:49.006
OKAY, STANLEY,
WE'RE ALL HERE

08:49.008 --> 08:51.041
TO GET TO THE ROOT OF
YOUR BEHAVIOR DISORDER.

08:51.043 --> 08:52.910
YOU REALLY SHOULD
KNOW BETTER, STANLEY.

08:52.912 --> 08:54.512
YOU NEED TO
SHAPE UP, MISTER.

08:54.514 --> 08:55.780
DON'T INTERRUPT ME.

08:55.782 --> 08:57.081
YOU ALWAYS
INTERRUPT ME
WHEN I TALK.

08:57.083 --> 08:58.215
CAN'T YOU
SEE THAT--

08:58.217 --> 08:59.350
I DON'T
INTERRUPT YOU.

08:59.352 --> 09:00.518
THERE, YOU
DID IT AGAIN.

09:00.520 --> 09:01.519
HE INTERRUPTED
ME AGAIN.

09:01.521 --> 09:04.789
OKAY, PERHAPS YOU SHOULD LET
YOUR WIFE FINISH TALKING,
MR. MARSH.

09:04.791 --> 09:06.590
NOW, STAN,
I WANT YOU TO--

09:06.592 --> 09:07.858
OKAY, I'M SORRY
TO INTERRUPT,

09:07.860 --> 09:09.326
BUT SHE ALWAYS TAKES OVER
ANY CONVERSATION.

09:09.328 --> 09:12.863
TAKING OVER ANY
CONVERSATIONS BAD?

09:12.865 --> 09:14.031
LIKE YOU'RE
ONE TO TALK.

09:14.033 --> 09:16.133
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU REALLY LISTENED

09:16.135 --> 09:17.334
TO WHAT I
HAD TO SAY?

09:17.336 --> 09:18.702
UH, UH, OKAY.

09:18.704 --> 09:21.372
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HAD
ANYTHING INTERESTING TO SAY?

09:21.374 --> 09:22.873
IT'S ALWAYS GOSSIP
AND STUPID CRAP.

09:22.875 --> 09:25.843
APPARENTLY, WE HAVE A BIT OF A
COMMUNICATION PROBLEM HERE.

09:25.845 --> 09:28.012
MR. MARSH, TELL ME
HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

09:28.014 --> 09:30.714
WELL, I FEEL LIKE
EVERYTHING I DO IS WRONG.

09:30.716 --> 09:32.283
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I SAY.

09:32.285 --> 09:33.684
OKAY, THAT'S VALID.

09:33.686 --> 09:35.719
NOW, MRS. MARSH,
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

09:35.721 --> 09:36.554
EXCUSE ME.

09:36.556 --> 09:37.655
LIKE I'M
A GHOST,

09:37.657 --> 09:39.356
LIKE HE SEES
RIGHT THROUGH ME.

09:39.358 --> 09:40.424
OH PLEASE!

09:40.426 --> 09:41.292
HELLO.

09:41.294 --> 09:42.226
OH PLEASE,
YOURSELF.

09:42.228 --> 09:43.594
WHO TRIES TO CONTROL
THE MARRIAGE?

09:43.596 --> 09:45.429
AND BY THAT,
I MEAN WHO'S DOMINATING

09:45.431 --> 09:47.798
THE ASPECTS OF
THE RELATIONSHIP?

09:47.800 --> 09:48.833
HE IS.

09:48.835 --> 09:49.967
NO, SHE IS.

09:49.969 --> 09:50.901
OH, I'M SORRY,

09:50.903 --> 09:52.236
I GUESS I'M
WRONG AGAIN!

09:52.238 --> 09:53.204
OKAY...

09:53.206 --> 09:54.338
LOOK AT IT, KENNY.

09:54.340 --> 09:57.074
IT IS THE GREATEST
CLUBHOUSE EVER BUILT.

09:57.076 --> 09:57.908
UH-HUH.

09:57.910 --> 09:59.276
AND WE BUILT IT,
WITH OUR OWN HANDS.

09:59.278 --> 10:01.745
NOW ALL WE NEED
IS CHICKS, KENNY.

10:01.747 --> 10:02.780
(mumbles)
YEAH!

10:02.782 --> 10:03.914
ALL RIGHT, YOU GO
FIND CHICKS, KENNY.

10:03.916 --> 10:05.382
(mumbling)
WHY AM I THE ONE
TO GO FIND CHICKS?

10:05.384 --> 10:06.917
BECAUSE I HAVE TO
STAY HERE AND WORK.

10:06.919 --> 10:08.152
I STILL GOT TO
SHINGLE THE ROOF,

10:08.154 --> 10:09.987
TEST THE FOUNDATION, RUN ALL
KINDS OF INSPECTIONS,

10:09.989 --> 10:10.955
I'VE GOT WAY
TOO MUCH TO DO,

10:10.957 --> 10:13.023
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS GO FIND CHICKS.

10:13.025 --> 10:15.292
NOW, STOP
YOUR BITCHIN'!

10:17.630 --> 10:19.897
MOM, CAN I WATCH
"AMERICAN GLADIATORS"?

10:19.899 --> 10:21.398
DUDE, WHERE
HAVE YOU BEEN?

10:21.400 --> 10:22.766
I'VE BEEN WAITING
ALL AFTERNOON.

10:22.768 --> 10:23.734
I GOT IN TROUBLE
FOR THAT NOTE

10:23.736 --> 10:25.269
BEBE WAS TRYING
TO PASS TO YOU.

10:25.271 --> 10:25.970
TO ME?

10:25.972 --> 10:27.204
I MEAN, NO,
NOT TO YOU, FORGET IT.

10:27.206 --> 10:28.572
COME ON, DUDE, WE HAVE TO
FINISH OUR CLUBHOUSE QUICK.

10:28.574 --> 10:31.775
THE GIRLS WANT TO PLAY
TRUTH OR DARE, TOMORROW.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.279
WE SHOULD
USE NAILS, DUDE.

10:35.281 --> 10:36.380
MY MOM
WON'T LET US.

10:36.382 --> 10:38.048
HI, GUYS, HOW'S
THE CLUBHOUSE COMING?

10:38.050 --> 10:39.483
PRETTY GOOD,
WE'RE ALMOST DONE.

10:39.485 --> 10:42.086
WELL HURRY, WE WANT TO
PLAY TRUTH OR DARE.

10:42.088 --> 10:43.521
WE'RE GOING
AS FAST AS WE CAN.

10:43.523 --> 10:47.691
KYLE, COULD YOU
TURN AROUND FOR A SECOND?

10:49.762 --> 10:51.395
THANK YOU.

10:51.397 --> 10:53.297
COME ON, DUDE, WE
HAVE TO HAMMER FASTER.

10:53.299 --> 10:57.034
HEY, STAN, DO YOU KNOW HOW TO
PLAY TRUTH OR DARE?

10:57.036 --> 10:57.735
NO!

10:57.737 --> 10:59.570
WELL, DUDE, HOW THE HELL ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO PLAY IT THEN?

10:59.572 --> 11:01.705
I DIDN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT THAT!

11:01.707 --> 11:04.708
...AND THEN THEY'LL
ASK, "TRUTH OR DARE?"

11:04.710 --> 11:05.743
AND I SAY "DARE."

11:05.745 --> 11:07.311
NO, NO,
YOU SAY "TRUTH."

11:07.313 --> 11:08.546
TRUTH?
BUT THAT'S BORING.

11:08.548 --> 11:09.813
I WANT TO GET
DARED TO KISS HER.

11:09.815 --> 11:11.582
YOU HAVE TO SAY TRUTH
THE FIRST FEW TIMES

11:11.584 --> 11:13.484
OR ELSE YOU'LL
SEEM TO EAGER.

11:13.486 --> 11:14.285
OH.

11:14.287 --> 11:15.352
YOU CAN'T
SEEM TO EAGER.

11:15.354 --> 11:16.420
YOU GOT TO
PLAY IT COOL.

11:16.422 --> 11:18.055
LIKE YOU DON'T EVEN
CARE WHAT HAPPENS.

11:18.057 --> 11:18.856
YEAH.

11:18.858 --> 11:22.192
THEN AFTER A FEW TRUTHS,
YOU FINALLY ANSWER "DARE."

11:22.194 --> 11:22.927
DARE!

11:22.929 --> 11:24.161
BUT NOT LIKE
THAT, SON.

11:24.163 --> 11:25.563
LIKE THIS:

11:25.565 --> 11:27.331
(slowly)
DARE...

11:27.333 --> 11:28.198
OH.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.968
AND THEN HER LITTLE FRIEND
WILL DARE YOU TO KISS WENDY.

11:30.970 --> 11:32.002
YOU REALLY
THINK SO?

11:32.004 --> 11:33.203
OF COURSE
SHE WILL.

11:33.205 --> 11:34.071
THEY'RE WOMEN.

11:34.073 --> 11:35.472
THEY'VE HAD THIS
WHOLE THING PLANNED OUT

11:35.474 --> 11:36.807
MONTHS AHEAD
OF TIME.

11:36.809 --> 11:38.242
WOW!

11:40.746 --> 11:43.280
HEY, HEY, HEY,
WHAT'S GOING
DOWN, Y'ALL?

11:43.282 --> 11:46.150
MAN, FAT ABBOT, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING ON THIS SIDE OF THE HOOD?

11:46.152 --> 11:48.018
YOU KNOW
SOMETHING, RUDY,

11:48.020 --> 11:49.987
YOU'RE LIKE SCHOOL
IN THE SUMMERTIME.

11:49.989 --> 11:51.655
SCHOOL IN THE
SUMMERTIME?

11:51.657 --> 11:52.656
YEAH, BITCH.

11:52.658 --> 11:53.791
SCHOOL IN
THE SUMMERTIME.

11:53.793 --> 11:56.193
OPEN YOUR FUCKING EARS OR
I'LL POP YOUR BITCH-ASS.

11:56.195 --> 11:59.563
I'LL-A POP-A YOUR-A BITCHA
ASS-A TOO-BA, BITCH-A.

11:59.565 --> 12:01.799
WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON IN THIS CARTOON?

12:01.801 --> 12:02.766
(doorbell)

12:02.768 --> 12:05.436
OH HEY, KENNY,
DID YOU FIND ANY CHICKS

12:05.438 --> 12:07.037
TO COME TO
THE CLUBHOUSE?

12:07.039 --> 12:08.238
UH-HUH.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.440
HI, WE RAN
AWAY FROM HOME.

12:09.442 --> 12:11.141
LIKE, THIS KID TOLD US
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO

12:11.143 --> 12:13.143
CRASH AT YOUR CLUBHOUSE
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

12:13.145 --> 12:15.713
HOLY CRAP!

12:15.715 --> 12:18.215
BEHOLD, EWOK VILLAGE 2000!

12:18.217 --> 12:19.917
OH, WELL, I GUESS
IT BEATS LIVING AT HOME.

12:19.919 --> 12:24.088
CAN I OFFER YOU LADIES A COOL
BEVERAGE OR A TASTY SNACK?

12:25.992 --> 12:27.591
(phone ringing)

12:27.593 --> 12:28.192
HELLO?

12:28.194 --> 12:29.526
HOW'S THE CLUBHOUSE
COMING, STAN?

12:29.528 --> 12:30.628
WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

12:30.630 --> 12:31.862
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
I'D TELL YOU THAT

12:31.864 --> 12:33.664
ME AND KENNY HAVE
FINISHED OUR CLUBHOUSE,

12:33.666 --> 12:35.899
AND WE ALREADY
HAVE CHICKS OVER.

12:35.901 --> 12:36.934
NO, YOU DON'T.

12:36.936 --> 12:38.902
(girls laughing
in the background)

12:38.904 --> 12:39.803
DUDE!

12:39.805 --> 12:40.904
IT'S ONLY A
MATTER OF TIME

12:40.906 --> 12:42.072
BEFORE WE'RE PLAYING
TRUTH OR DARE WITH THEM.

12:42.074 --> 12:44.308
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR
PIECE-OF-CRAP CLUBHOUSE.

12:44.310 --> 12:46.010
FAT ASS,
FAT HUNK OF FAT.

12:46.012 --> 12:47.244
MOM, WILL YOU
PLEASE ASK DAD

12:47.246 --> 12:48.479
TO COME HELP ME
BUILD MY CLUBHOUSE?

12:48.481 --> 12:49.880
STANLEY, I THINK
YOU SHOULD KNOW

12:49.882 --> 12:51.715
THAT YOUR FATHER
HAS MOVED OUT.

12:51.717 --> 12:52.683
WHAT!
WHY?

12:52.685 --> 12:54.852
BECAUSE... WE'RE
DIVORCED, STANLEY.

12:54.854 --> 12:56.020
DIVORCED, OH NO!

12:56.022 --> 12:58.288
DOES THAT MEAN YOU AND DAD
DON'T LOVE ME ANYMORE?

12:58.290 --> 13:00.524
THIS IS ALL
MY FAULT, ISN'T IT?

13:00.526 --> 13:01.859
YEAH, KIND OF.

13:01.861 --> 13:03.894
DUDE, YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO SAY THAT.

13:03.896 --> 13:07.798
BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO
MEET YOUR NEW STEPFATHER, ROY.

13:07.800 --> 13:08.899
HELLO, SON.

13:08.901 --> 13:09.800
WHAT?!

13:09.802 --> 13:11.301
I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE
TO GET ACQUAINTED.

13:11.303 --> 13:11.969
HELLO, STANLEY.

13:11.971 --> 13:13.637
I KNOW THIS MUST BE A VERY
DIFFICULT PERIOD
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW,

13:13.639 --> 13:16.106
AND THE ADJUSTMENT IS
GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME.

13:16.108 --> 13:17.274
BUT I'D LIKE
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

13:17.276 --> 13:19.476
SO WHEN YOU'RE READY,
I WANT YOU TO FEEL FREE

13:19.478 --> 13:21.211
TO COME TO ME WITH
ANYTHING YOU MIGHT NEED,

13:21.213 --> 13:24.515
WHETHER IT'S ADVICE OR JUST
SOMEONE TO PLAY CATCH WITH.

13:24.517 --> 13:25.516
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

13:25.518 --> 13:26.517
THIS IS HAPPENING
WAY TOO FAST.

13:26.519 --> 13:28.819
OH, JESUS, WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO CUT ME SOME SLACK, HUH?

13:28.821 --> 13:31.555
I HAVE TAKEN YOU UNDER
MY WING AND DONE MY BEST,

13:31.557 --> 13:33.457
AND ALL YOU EVER DO IS
WHINE AND MOAN ABOUT IT!

13:33.459 --> 13:36.960
NOW, FOR THE LAST TIME,
GO CUT SOME FIREWOOD!

13:38.798 --> 13:40.731
...SO I'M ON MY WAY
OUT THE DOOR AND SHE GOES,

13:40.733 --> 13:42.900
"MAKE SURE YOU'RE
HOME BEFORE MIDNIGHT."

13:42.902 --> 13:43.901
OH THAT'S WEAK.

13:43.903 --> 13:45.402
AND I GO, "LISTEN BITCH,
I DON'T NEED MY MOTHER

13:45.404 --> 13:46.770
GIVING ME
NO CURFEW."

13:46.772 --> 13:47.805
THAT'S KILLER.

13:47.807 --> 13:49.540
AND SHE GOES, "IF YOU'RE
NOT HOME BEFORE MIDNIGHT,

13:49.542 --> 13:51.041
DON'T BOTHER
COMING HOME AT ALL."

13:51.043 --> 13:52.142
THAT'S TOTALLY WEAK.

13:52.144 --> 13:54.244
SO I GO, "FINE,
I WON'T COME HOME."

13:54.246 --> 13:55.045
SWEET.

13:55.047 --> 13:56.313
AND THEN SHE GOES,
"FINE DON'T COME HOME."

13:56.315 --> 13:57.247
GETTING ALL IN
MY FACE AND CRAP

13:57.249 --> 13:58.549
AND ACTING ALL
TOUGH AND CRAP.

13:58.551 --> 13:59.316
KILLER WEAK SWEET.

13:59.318 --> 14:02.486
I'M 16, I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO DO WHAT I WANT, WHEN I WANT.

14:02.488 --> 14:04.822
I DON'T NEED HER BREATHING DOWN
MY NECK EVERY TWO SECONDS

14:04.824 --> 14:06.356
TELLING ME WHAT
I CAN AND CANNOT DO.

14:06.358 --> 14:08.158
I HAD THE SAME THING
WITH MY MOM THE OTHER DAY.

14:08.160 --> 14:10.794
I'M ALL LIKE, "HEY, I'M NOT
A LITTLE KID ANYMORE.

14:10.796 --> 14:14.298
"MOM, I'M EIGHT YEARS OLD,
AND IF I WANT TO FINGER PAINT,

14:14.300 --> 14:17.201
THEN I'M GOING
TO FINGER PAINT!"

14:19.338 --> 14:20.471
OKAY,
WE'RE DONE.

14:20.473 --> 14:22.773
DUDE, I DON'T THINK
THIS IS VERY STURDY.

14:22.775 --> 14:23.974
IT DOESN'T
MATTER, DUDE.

14:23.976 --> 14:25.809
IT ONLY HAS TO LAST
LONG ENOUGH TO PLAY
TRUTH OR DARE.

14:25.811 --> 14:27.544
I'M GOING TO GO
GET THE GIRLS.

14:27.546 --> 14:28.979
OKAY.

14:28.981 --> 14:31.248
(humming)

14:31.250 --> 14:31.882
OH!

14:31.884 --> 14:33.150
STANLEY, IT'S
TIME TO GO!

14:33.152 --> 14:33.884
GO WHERE?

14:33.886 --> 14:36.253
YOUR BASTARD FATHER HAS
VISITATION RIGHTS,

14:36.255 --> 14:37.454
AND THIS IS
HIS TIME WITH YOU.

14:37.456 --> 14:39.189
BUT MOM, I HAVE TO GO
GET THE GIRLS TO COME--

14:39.191 --> 14:40.591
COME ON, STANLEY.
WEAK!

14:40.593 --> 14:41.658
DAD?

14:41.660 --> 14:43.894
HEY, STANLEY,
HOP IN.

14:44.697 --> 14:45.362
LISTEN, STANLEY,

14:45.364 --> 14:46.797
I KNOW ALL THIS CHANGE
MUST BE TOUGH ON YOU,

14:46.799 --> 14:49.099
BUT YOUR MOTHER AND
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

14:49.101 --> 14:50.701
BEST FOR ALL OF US
IF WE SPLIT UP.

14:50.703 --> 14:52.636
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY WE HAVE TO--

14:52.638 --> 14:53.771
WELL HELLO, LADIES!

14:53.773 --> 14:54.805
HI, HANDSOME.

14:54.807 --> 14:56.540
WE'RE GOING TO BE
AT LARRY'S BAR TONIGHT.

14:56.542 --> 14:57.741
I'M ALREADY THERE.

14:57.743 --> 14:59.777
WHAT WERE WE
TALKING ABOUT?

14:59.779 --> 15:00.778
OH, YEAH.

15:00.780 --> 15:02.813
SEE, YOUR MOTHER AND I STILL
CARE ABOUT YOU AND YOUR SISTER,

15:02.815 --> 15:05.249
BUT WE JUST DON'T LIKE BEING
AROUND EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

15:05.251 --> 15:07.151
WELL, I DON'T LIKE BEING
AROUND MY SISTER ANYMORE,

15:07.153 --> 15:08.085
DOES THAT MEAN I CAN
LEAVE HER TOO?

15:08.087 --> 15:10.220
WELL, NO, BECAUSE YOU'RE FAMILY,
YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE FAMILY.

15:10.222 --> 15:12.656
YOU HAVE STICK WITH
FAMILY NO MATTER WHAT.

15:12.658 --> 15:16.560
BUT YOU AND MOM ARE FAMILY,
HOW COME YOU CAN JUST SPLIT UP?

15:16.562 --> 15:17.294
YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

15:17.296 --> 15:19.096
I THINK THAT WHEN YOU
AND MOM GOT MARRIED,

15:19.098 --> 15:19.730
YOU BECAME FAMILY.

15:19.732 --> 15:21.965
AND NOW THAT YOU ARE, YOU
SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO LEAVE HER

15:21.967 --> 15:23.767
ANY MORE THAN THAN
I CAN LEAVE MY SISTER.

15:23.769 --> 15:25.669
OH STAN,
YOU'RE SO YOUNG.

15:25.671 --> 15:26.970
YOU JUST
DON'T GET IT.

15:26.972 --> 15:28.405
WELL ANYWAY,
HAVE A NICE DAY.

15:28.407 --> 15:29.439
WHAT, THAT'S IT?

15:29.441 --> 15:30.808
YEAH, BUT I LOVED
OUR TIME TOGETHER.

15:30.810 --> 15:32.342
I HATE TO SEE IT END,
GO ON, GET OUT.

15:32.344 --> 15:34.845
YOU KNOW THAT NOTHING
IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME

15:34.847 --> 15:36.180
THAN YOU,
RIGHT, STAN?

15:36.182 --> 15:37.581
I GUESS, BUT--

15:41.620 --> 15:43.720
OKAY, DUDE, THE GIRLS
ARE GOING TO BE HERE

15:43.722 --> 15:44.755
TO PLAY TRUTH OR
DARE ANY MINUTE.

15:44.757 --> 15:45.756
STAN, IF I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU BETTER,

15:45.758 --> 15:46.824
I WOULD ALMOST THINK
YOU'RE DOING THIS

15:46.826 --> 15:48.292
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO
PLAY WITH GIRLS.

15:48.294 --> 15:49.459
NO WAY, DUDE,
DON'T BE SILLY.

15:49.461 --> 15:50.227
(Bebe)
COME ON, WENDY!

15:50.229 --> 15:51.628
WE HAVE TO SAY "TRUTH"
A COUPLE OF TIMES

15:51.630 --> 15:52.930
BEFORE WE
SAY "DARE", RIGHT?

15:52.932 --> 15:53.864
RIGHT, WHY?

15:53.866 --> 15:55.365
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T,
WE'LL SEEM TO EAGER.

15:55.367 --> 15:56.400
TO EAGER
TO WHAT?

15:56.402 --> 15:58.068
TO SAY DARE,
DUMB-ASS, GEEZ.

15:58.070 --> 15:58.936
HI GUYS.

15:58.938 --> 16:00.404
OH HI, WENDY,
WHAT'S UP?

16:00.406 --> 16:02.406
DON'T YOU GUYS STILL
WANT TO PLAY TRUTH OR DARE?

16:02.408 --> 16:04.975
YEAH, I MEAN...
SURE, WHATEVER.

16:04.977 --> 16:05.976
THEN COME ON!

16:05.978 --> 16:07.644
REMEMBER TRUTH THE
FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES.

16:07.646 --> 16:08.512
OKAY.

16:08.514 --> 16:09.913
WHO WANTS
TO GO FIRST?

16:09.915 --> 16:11.114
I WILL,
KYLE?

16:11.116 --> 16:12.015
YEAH?

16:12.017 --> 16:13.116
TRUTH OR DARE?

16:13.118 --> 16:14.017
UM, DARE?

16:14.019 --> 16:15.085
DUDE!
WHAT?

16:15.087 --> 16:16.119
(whispering)

16:16.121 --> 16:17.721
KISS BEBE
ON THE LIPS.

16:17.723 --> 16:20.023
WHAT? SICK, DUDE!
I'M NOT KISSING A GIRL!

16:20.025 --> 16:21.225
WHAT'S THE
MATTER, KYLE?

16:21.227 --> 16:22.693
IT'S JUST WRONG,
THAT'S ALL!

16:22.695 --> 16:23.827
DON'T BE A
CHICKEN, DUDE.

16:23.829 --> 16:24.661
JUST CLOSE
YOUR EYES.

16:24.663 --> 16:25.729
WHAT THE HELL HAVE
YOU GOTTEN ME INTO!

16:25.731 --> 16:26.763
DUDE, CARTMAN
IS IN HIS CLUBHOUSE

16:26.765 --> 16:28.031
PLAYING TRUTH OR DARE
WITH GIRLS RIGHT NOW.

16:28.033 --> 16:29.967
DO YOU REALLY WANT
HIM TO BEAT US?

16:31.737 --> 16:33.670
OH BOY.

16:36.709 --> 16:39.009
SICK!
AH, FUCKING SICKENING!

16:39.011 --> 16:40.844
WOW, LOOK AT
THAT ASS.

16:40.846 --> 16:42.145
SHAKE IT, BABY!

16:42.147 --> 16:43.380
YOUR TURN, BEBE.

16:43.382 --> 16:47.017
OKAY STAN,
TRUTH OR DARE?

16:50.155 --> 16:51.655
STAN,
TRUTH OR DARE?

16:51.657 --> 16:52.623
(slowly)
DARE.

16:52.625 --> 16:55.359
SON, COULD YOU PLEASE COME
HELP ME WITH THE FIREWOOD?

16:55.361 --> 16:57.895
DUDE, WE CUT FIREWOOD
ALL DAY YESTERDAY.

16:57.897 --> 16:59.296
WE HAVE ENOUGH
TO LAST 12 YEARS.

16:59.298 --> 17:01.498
WHEN WILL YOU LET ME IN,
LET ME LOVE YOU!

17:01.500 --> 17:03.834
NOW GET YOUR ASS
OUT HERE AND HELP ME.

17:03.836 --> 17:04.935
BYE, STAN.

17:04.937 --> 17:07.371
HOPEFULLY WE CAN PLAY
TRUTH OR DARE TOMORROW.

17:07.373 --> 17:08.505
CRAP!

17:08.507 --> 17:09.406
I THINK YOU
SHOULD BE ABLE

17:09.408 --> 17:11.074
TO MOVE OUT LEGALLY
WHEN YOU'RE 14.

17:11.076 --> 17:12.843
OUR MOMS WON'T EVEN
LET US SMOKE.

17:12.845 --> 17:14.177
YEAH, IT'S MY BODY.

17:14.179 --> 17:16.813
MY MOM ALWAYS GIVES ME
SHIT FOR SMOKING,
BUT IT'S MY BODY.

17:16.815 --> 17:18.215
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO
WHATEVER I WANT WITH IT.

17:18.217 --> 17:21.118
TOTALLY... MY MOM GIVES
ME SHIT SOMETIMES,

17:21.120 --> 17:24.454
AND I TELL HER TO
SHUT HER HOLE BEFORE
I KICK HER IN THE NUTS.

17:24.456 --> 17:26.123
(Eric's mom)
ERIC, POOKUMS,
IT'S TIME FOR MOMMY

17:26.125 --> 17:28.525
TO TUCK YOU INTO YOUR
SNUGGLE BED FOR NIGHT-NIGHT.

17:28.527 --> 17:32.029
ERIC, ARE YOU OUT THERE
IN YOUR CLUBHOUSE?

17:32.031 --> 17:34.231
COMING, MOM.

17:34.233 --> 17:35.933
OKAY, WE HAVE TO
PLAY TRUTH OR DARE, QUICK!

17:35.935 --> 17:37.534
WHAT'S UP?
HEY, GIRLS,

17:37.536 --> 17:38.635
OH HEY, SCOTT.

17:38.637 --> 17:39.836
WHO THE
HELL ARE YOU!

17:39.838 --> 17:41.338
OH, WE INVITED
SOME PEOPLE OVER.

17:41.340 --> 17:42.506
HOPE YOU
DON'T MIND.

17:42.508 --> 17:43.440
HOW MANY PEOPLE?

17:43.442 --> 17:44.808
KYLE, CAN I
TALK TO YOU?
OKAY.

17:44.810 --> 17:46.977
KYLE, THIS IS
VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME.

17:46.979 --> 17:48.812
I THINK WE
NEED TIME APART.

17:48.814 --> 17:49.646
HUH?

17:49.648 --> 17:50.747
I'M JUST FEELING
REALLY TRAPPED.

17:50.749 --> 17:52.382
I CAN'T GO ON WITH
THIS CO-DEPENDENCY.

17:52.384 --> 17:53.483
OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

17:53.485 --> 17:54.751
NO, NO,
DON'T SPEAK.

17:54.753 --> 17:55.953
JUST TRY AND
UNDERSTAND.

17:55.955 --> 17:57.421
IT HAS TO
BE THIS WAY.

17:57.423 --> 17:58.488
BUT I
DON'T CARE.

17:58.490 --> 18:00.190
PLEASE, JUST REMEMBER
THE GOOD TIMES WE HAD.

18:00.192 --> 18:02.459
I'LL NEVER
FORGET YOU, NEVER.

18:02.461 --> 18:04.094
OKAY, CLYDE,
WE CAN GO NOW.

18:04.096 --> 18:05.162
BITCHIN'.

18:05.164 --> 18:08.765
(t.v.)
THESE ARE CAFE CURTAINS
THAT REQUIRE NO SEWING.

18:08.767 --> 18:11.101
AND I KNOW
YOU ALL LOVE THAT!

18:11.103 --> 18:12.336
DO YOU MIND IF I
WATCH CARTOONS?

18:12.338 --> 18:13.603
I'VE HAD A ROUGH DAY.

18:13.605 --> 18:14.638
UH, UH.

18:14.640 --> 18:15.505
WHAT?

18:15.507 --> 18:16.707
CHORES,
DO CHORES.

18:16.709 --> 18:17.774
MY DAD LETS
ME WATCH CARTOONS.

18:17.776 --> 18:19.109
WELL, I'M NOT
YOUR DAD, OKAY?

18:19.111 --> 18:20.444
I'M NOT YOUR DAD!

18:20.446 --> 18:24.448
YOU CAN'T JUST GO AROUND
PLAYING GAMES WITH MY EMOTIONS.

18:24.450 --> 18:25.048
(CRYING)

18:25.050 --> 18:26.883
STANLEY, WHAT DID
YOU DO TO ROY?

18:26.885 --> 18:27.884
ROY'S A DICK.

18:27.886 --> 18:29.653
HE RUINED MY CHANCES
WITH WENDY IN THE CLUBHOUSE.

18:29.655 --> 18:31.555
STANLEY, YOU KNOW
YOU'RE THE MOST

18:31.557 --> 18:32.556
IMPORTANT THING
TO ME, RIGHT?

18:32.558 --> 18:34.758
IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN GET BACK
TOGETHER WITH DAD FOR ME.

18:34.760 --> 18:37.160
NOW, STANLEY, YOU HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND HOW DIVORCE WORKS.

18:37.162 --> 18:38.996
WHEN I SAY YOU'RE THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING TO ME,

18:38.998 --> 18:41.999
WHAT I MEAN IS, YOU'RE THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING AFTER ME,

18:42.001 --> 18:44.134
AND MY HAPPINESS
AND MY NEW ROMANCES.

18:44.136 --> 18:45.002
OH.

18:45.004 --> 18:46.203
BYE NOW... ROY?

18:46.205 --> 18:47.504
DIVORCE
IS STUPID.

18:47.506 --> 18:48.505
HEY, HEY, HEY...

18:48.507 --> 18:52.042
YOLANDA, WHY'S YOUR EYE ALL
BLACK AND BLUE AND SH-(beep)?

18:52.044 --> 18:55.445
MAN, FAT ABBOT, MY STEPDAD
POPPED ME IN MY EYE.

18:55.447 --> 18:56.413
STEPDAD?

18:56.415 --> 18:58.382
YOU GOT TO
OFF HIS ASS.

18:58.384 --> 18:59.349
REALLY?

18:59.351 --> 19:00.317
YEAH, BITCH!

19:00.319 --> 19:01.651
SNATCH HIS ASS
IN A BEAR TRAP.

19:01.653 --> 19:04.588
LEAVE THAT (beep)
SWINGING FROM A TREE
SO HIGH,

19:04.590 --> 19:06.323
NOBODY FINDS HIM
FOR DAYS.

19:06.325 --> 19:08.358
GLOCK-GLOCK,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

19:08.360 --> 19:10.727
DUMB-ASS, (beep)
PULLING (beep), DAMN!

19:10.729 --> 19:12.896
YOU'RE RIGHT,
FAT ABBOT, THANKS!

19:12.898 --> 19:13.897
NO PROBLEM, HO'.

19:13.899 --> 19:17.034
MAYBE LATER YOU CAN
SUCK MY (beep), BITCH HO'.

19:17.036 --> 19:20.670
WELL, FAT ABBOT AND THE GANG
SURE DID LEARN SOMETHING TODAY.

19:20.672 --> 19:22.973
IF YOU HAVE A STEPDAD
RIDING YOUR ASS,

19:22.975 --> 19:25.108
JUST SNATCH HIS ASS
IN A BEAR TRAP.

19:25.110 --> 19:26.543
CRACK, NO MORE STEPDAD.

19:26.545 --> 19:28.178
SEE YOU NEXT TIME,
EATING THE PUDDING.

19:28.180 --> 19:32.616
YEAH, YEAH, I THINK I'LL
WRITE A LITTLE NOTE FOR ROY.

19:32.618 --> 19:35.485
(party sounds)

19:37.089 --> 19:39.556
HEY, KID, GIVE ME
SOME OF THOSE.

19:39.558 --> 19:42.726
HEY, WHEN ARE WE
GONNA PLAY TRUTH OR DARE?

19:42.728 --> 19:43.560
WHAT?

19:43.562 --> 19:44.761
THAT GAME'S
FOR KIDS.

19:44.763 --> 19:45.929
THIS IS
BULLCRAP!

19:45.931 --> 19:47.230
OH BOY, IT'S
GETTING LATE.

19:47.232 --> 19:48.799
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
LEAVE THIS PARTY.

19:48.801 --> 19:49.833
THIS SUCKS, KENNY.

19:49.835 --> 19:51.568
I WISH WE'D NEVER
BUILT A CLUBHOUSE.

19:51.570 --> 19:53.036
(music starts)

19:53.038 --> 19:54.704
MOSH PIT!

19:54.706 --> 19:57.340
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

19:57.910 --> 20:01.078
OH MY GOD,
THEY KILLED KENNY!

20:01.080 --> 20:03.914
YOU BASTARDS!

20:04.750 --> 20:08.952
STANLEY, YOUR FATHER IS
COMING OVER FOR VISITATION.

20:08.954 --> 20:09.853
STAN?

20:09.855 --> 20:13.123
"MEET ME IN
THE CLUBHOUSE."

20:13.926 --> 20:18.228
SHARON, SHARON, HAVE YOU SEEN
MY COPY OF "HARPER'S"?

20:18.230 --> 20:20.697
(thinking)
"MEET ME AT THE CLUBHOUSE."

20:23.168 --> 20:25.168
OH, RANDY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

20:25.170 --> 20:28.538
I, UH, GOT A NOTE FROM STANLEY
TO COME OUT TO THE CLUBHOUSE.

20:28.540 --> 20:30.440
OH, I THOUGHT
THAT NOTE WAS FOR ME.

20:30.442 --> 20:31.475
OH, MAYBE IT WAS.

20:31.477 --> 20:33.510
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
OUR LITTLE STANLEY

20:33.512 --> 20:35.378
HAS BUILT HIMSELF
QUITE A CLUBHOUSE HERE.

20:35.380 --> 20:37.814
I REMEMBER NOT TOO LONG AGO
WE WERE JUST KIDS

20:37.816 --> 20:41.184
PLAYING KISSING
GAMES IN MY CLUBHOUSE.

20:42.387 --> 20:43.820
GOOD NIGHT.

20:43.822 --> 20:44.788
SHARON?
YES?

20:44.790 --> 20:45.622
TRUTH OR DARE.

20:45.624 --> 20:46.623
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR GAMES.

20:46.625 --> 20:47.891
NO, I'M SERIOUS,
PLEASE.

20:47.893 --> 20:49.159
TRUTH OR DARE?

20:49.161 --> 20:50.127
TRUTH.

20:50.129 --> 20:50.994
DO YOU STILL
LOVE ME?

20:50.996 --> 20:53.230
OH, RANDY I DO LOVE YOU,
BUT NOW I'M SO CONFUSED.

20:53.232 --> 20:54.297
I'M LIVING
WITH ROY,

20:54.299 --> 20:56.199
