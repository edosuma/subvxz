WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:05.744
- And I believe
that's all I've got.

00:05.788 --> 00:07.659
Oh, wait,
there's one more thing.

00:07.703 --> 00:10.010
Peralta gave me a note
before the meeting.

00:11.446 --> 00:15.058
Ugh, the penmanship is horrid,
but I think it says,

00:15.102 --> 00:17.147
"Ask if anyone has
an anal mint."

00:17.191 --> 00:19.149
- It's announcements,
and we do.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.585
- Wow, what an entrance.

00:20.629 --> 00:23.501
- Amy and I have
some big news to share.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.677
- I'm pregnant.
- We're pregnant!

00:25.721 --> 00:27.505
- Wow, I can't believe it.
- Congratulations.

00:27.549 --> 00:28.767
- What a surprise.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.334
- What the hell?
I thought you guys would be

00:30.378 --> 00:32.467
more excited than that.
Charles, you didn't even faint.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.817
- I'm so sorry, I'll try.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.340
It's not working.
Somebody choke me.

00:36.384 --> 00:37.385
- On it.
- Rosa.

00:37.428 --> 00:39.300
Sorry, we're so happy for you,

00:39.343 --> 00:41.563
but we also maybe,
kind of already knew.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.391
I mean, you didn't do
the best job of hiding it.

00:43.434 --> 00:46.307
Why have you been carrying
that box around so much?

00:46.350 --> 00:47.699
- I just love this box.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.179
- Why are you reading
that newspaper?

00:49.223 --> 00:51.051
It's two days old.
- I just love this issue.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.530
- Hey, why are you wearing
that hazmat suit?

00:52.574 --> 00:53.836
- I just love this look.

00:53.879 --> 00:55.664
- Okay, fine, so you all
knew we were pregnant.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.405
Good for you.
But I bet you didn't figure out

00:57.448 --> 00:59.233
that we're having twins.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.584
- No, not really.
It's one baby.

01:02.627 --> 01:04.325
I just needed
to see Charles faint.

01:24.388 --> 01:25.694
- Aw, Jake.

01:25.737 --> 01:28.392
I am excited that
you're having a kid.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.090
- Thank you, Dad.
Oh, and hey, if you're free

01:30.133 --> 01:31.656
next Friday, we're having
a sex reveal party.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.397
- Well, I went to one
of those in Amsterdam.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.399
I would not invite relatives.

01:35.443 --> 01:37.053
- What?
No, no, no.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.186
It's a party where we find out
the biological sex of the baby

01:39.229 --> 01:40.317
in a surprising way.

01:40.361 --> 01:41.623
- You better hope
you're having a girl.

01:41.666 --> 01:44.234
Peralta fathers do not
get along with sons.

01:44.278 --> 01:45.670
- What?
That's not true.

01:45.714 --> 01:47.411
I mean, look at us.
We're doing better than ever.

01:47.455 --> 01:49.326
This year, you even remembered
my birthday month.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.154
- Things are good now,
but honestly,

01:51.198 --> 01:53.809
it's probably just a blip.
- Well, that's fun to hear.

01:53.852 --> 01:55.332
- Well, that's just
the way it is.

01:55.376 --> 01:56.638
It's the family curse.

01:56.681 --> 01:58.901
I haven't talked to my father
since you were 10.

01:58.944 --> 02:01.338
His dad abandoned him
at the World's Fair.

02:01.382 --> 02:05.908
His dad fled to America after
drowning his dad in a well.

02:05.951 --> 02:07.257
- Oh, my God.

02:07.301 --> 02:09.781
Okay, so yes, fine,
there's a bit of a trend.

02:09.825 --> 02:11.609
But we're not cursed.
You and I are good.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.568
I bet you could even
fix things up with your dad.

02:13.611 --> 02:15.004
- The Admiral?

02:15.047 --> 02:16.875
I always hoped that I could
reconcile things with him

02:16.919 --> 02:18.616
one day, but he's not
going to let that happen.

02:18.660 --> 02:21.619
What can I tell you?
We're not meant to have sons.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.621
There's a demon in our genes.

02:23.665 --> 02:26.320
- Title of your sex tape.
- No, the title of my sex tape

02:26.363 --> 02:28.800
is "Cockpit Larry and
the Mile High Stewardae."

02:28.844 --> 02:29.932
- What?
- "Stewardae."

02:29.975 --> 02:31.934
It's plural
for stewardess.

02:31.977 --> 02:32.935
- Okay.

02:32.978 --> 02:34.632
- ADA Kurm, how are you?

02:34.676 --> 02:37.287
- Do you want the real answer,
about how my wife's leaving me,

02:37.331 --> 02:39.637
or do you just want me to say,
"Good, how are you?"

02:39.681 --> 02:41.117
- The latter?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.858
- Good, how are you?
- We're fine; why are you here?

02:42.901 --> 02:44.686
- You know that Carroll Street
Brownstone B&E?

02:44.729 --> 02:46.731
- Yeah, broken windows,
swiped an old TV.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.516
- The house belongs
to a friend of the mayor's.

02:48.559 --> 02:51.954
- Oh, I didn't realize
the case was a priority.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.390
I'll check into it right away.

02:53.434 --> 02:55.175
- Great, call me as soon as
you have anything.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.612
- Yeah.
Will do.

02:57.655 --> 02:59.614
Oh, God, what a nightmare.

02:59.657 --> 03:00.658
- Agreed.
Dude's a mess.

03:00.702 --> 03:01.659
You know he's only 24?

03:01.703 --> 03:03.183
- No, the Carroll Street case.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.315
I didn't realize that the mayor
was interested in it,

03:05.359 --> 03:07.926
and I think I did
something bad.

03:07.970 --> 03:10.451
- You gave Hitchcock and Scully
an important case?

03:10.494 --> 03:13.236
both:

03:13.280 --> 03:14.846
- Okay, here's the cake.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.370
If it's pink on the inside,
it's a girl.

03:16.413 --> 03:17.545
And if it's blue, it's a boy.

03:17.588 --> 03:19.199
- And why do you seem
so bummed by that?

03:19.242 --> 03:21.331
- Because I still think you
should have done the pig roast,

03:21.375 --> 03:22.811
where we start eating it
from the snout,

03:22.854 --> 03:24.813
and discover the baby's sex
when we get to the genitals.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.423
- Yeah, you know,
Amy wanted to do that too,

03:26.467 --> 03:27.555
but I just don't see it.
- Hmm.

03:27.598 --> 03:28.730
- I'm getting a text.

03:28.773 --> 03:30.732
Ooh.
"I will see you soon, sir."

03:30.775 --> 03:32.342
Guess who that was.
- Elton John.

03:32.386 --> 03:33.474
- What?

03:33.517 --> 03:34.649
- You said "sir,"
and that's on you.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.259
- No, it was my grandfather,
the Admiral.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.565
- Whoa, you tracked him down?

03:37.608 --> 03:38.827
- Yup, he's on his way
to my apartment right now.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.524
I'm going to fix
his relationship with my dad.

03:40.568 --> 03:41.873
It's going to be
very emotional.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.179
- It's going to be so dramatic.
You should be

03:43.223 --> 03:44.528
producing for Ellen.
- Do you really think so?

03:44.572 --> 03:45.964
'Cause I actually have
another idea for a segment

03:46.008 --> 03:47.749
where Ellen turns your home
into a haunted house.

03:47.792 --> 03:50.578
I call it "Extreme Makeover:
Bone Edition."

03:52.884 --> 03:55.017
But you know, I...
I don't have to do it.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.671
I like being a cop.
- And you're so good at it.

03:56.714 --> 03:58.020
- Yeah, okay, I'm going
to go meet my grandpa.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.239
- Yup.

04:01.502 --> 04:03.895
- Ooh, fun!
Terry's playing the flute.

04:03.939 --> 04:06.463
- At work.
Who are you, William Wonka?

04:06.507 --> 04:08.335
- No, this is police business.

04:08.378 --> 04:10.728
The flautist
for the NYPD band retired,

04:10.772 --> 04:12.730
and I'm going to audition
to take her spot.

04:12.774 --> 04:15.385
Captain Holt, you love music.
Can you give me some pointers?

04:15.429 --> 04:18.301
- I'd rather not.
The music they play is dreck.

04:18.345 --> 04:19.824
Last month,
they performed Sousa

04:19.868 --> 04:21.391
at a fallen officer's funeral.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.698
And the people were
so appalled, they cried.

04:23.741 --> 04:25.265
- Or they were crying
for the deceased.

04:25.308 --> 04:26.483
- No, she was very unpopular.

04:26.527 --> 04:29.312
The band made them cry.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.053
- Suffice it to say,
I don't respect what they do,

04:31.096 --> 04:32.489
so I wouldn't be
the right teacher.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.274
I'm sorry.

04:36.058 --> 04:37.712
- Hey, Grandpa.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.931
- Attention!
- Oh.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.977
- At ease.
Just pulling your leg.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.414
I'm your grandfather,
not your commanding officer.

04:44.458 --> 04:45.415
Now, come on.
- Aw.

04:45.459 --> 04:46.938
- Give me a handshake.
- Okay.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.157
Right, come on in.

04:48.200 --> 04:52.335
- Wow, it's really been
quite a while, huh?

04:52.379 --> 04:53.597
- Yeah.
- Are you still watching

04:53.641 --> 04:55.556
those cartoons
about the karate lizards?

04:55.599 --> 04:57.732
- The "Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles"?

04:57.775 --> 04:59.777
I am.
There was recently a reboot.

04:59.821 --> 05:00.996
They did
some interesting things

05:01.039 --> 05:02.606
with Splinter
and Krang's backstories.

05:02.650 --> 05:03.999
Anyways, I'm an adult now.
How are you?

05:04.042 --> 05:06.654
- Oh, me?
Well, I guess I'm...

05:11.006 --> 05:12.616
- Grandpa?
- What?

05:12.660 --> 05:13.922
- Oh, I was just asking
how you were.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.880
- Oh, sharp as ever.
- Yeah.

05:15.924 --> 05:17.447
- I'm so glad you
reached out to me.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.754
- Same, you know, now that
I'm having a baby of my own,

05:19.797 --> 05:21.495
I've started to realize
how important

05:21.538 --> 05:23.801
father/son/grandfather
relationships really are.

05:23.845 --> 05:26.717
Which reminds me,
my dad is also coming.

05:26.761 --> 05:27.805
- He is?

05:27.849 --> 05:29.111
I'm surprised
he wanted to see me.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.548
- Well, he doesn't exactly
know you're here.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.811
I thought it might be cool
to surprise both of you.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.987
- You know who else
thought surprises were cool?

05:36.031 --> 05:39.426
Admiral Yamamoto, and we all
know what happened then, huh?

05:39.469 --> 05:40.818
- We do?
- Pearl Harbor.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.646
- Pearl Harbor, right.
Some surprises can be bad.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.779
But this one's not gonna be.
This one's gonna be good,

05:44.822 --> 05:45.823
just like...
- The Battle of Midway.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.347
- The Bimble of Durbay.
Yup.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.435
We both said the same
thing at the same time.

05:48.478 --> 05:49.740
Oh, that's my Dad.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.786
This is going to be amazing.

05:51.829 --> 05:53.831
- Hey, Jakey.
- Roger Peralta.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.485
Prepare to hug and cry.

05:55.529 --> 05:58.880
This is your father.

05:58.923 --> 06:01.883
- Dad, you son of a bitch.

06:01.926 --> 06:03.885
- Uh-oh.
Ow!

06:07.236 --> 06:08.977
I can't believe you hit me.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.239
- I'm sorry.

06:10.282 --> 06:12.154
- My face is throbbing.
Hey, "Dino Bites."

06:12.197 --> 06:13.547
- What the hell is
my father doing here?

06:13.590 --> 06:15.287
- You said you wanted
to reconcile.

06:15.331 --> 06:16.985
- I meant after he was dead.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.552
I planned on standing
over his grave

06:18.595 --> 06:20.162
and yelling, "I forgive you."

06:20.205 --> 06:22.164
- Well, you may get the chance
sooner than you think.

06:22.207 --> 06:24.079
He keeps trailing off
and staring into space.

06:24.122 --> 06:26.429
That's his old trick.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.344
Whenever he doesn't want
to talk about something,

06:28.388 --> 06:29.998
he does that.
The old bastard.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.565
- Look, I know
you don't like him,

06:31.608 --> 06:35.220
but can you at least
try to be nice for me?

06:35.264 --> 06:37.353
- Okay.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.746
I'll be nice.

06:38.789 --> 06:41.009
I wish you were dead,
you lousy son of a bitch!

06:41.052 --> 06:42.489
- You said
you were gonna be nice.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.578
- I lied so I could say
the "son of a bitch" thing.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.057
- Dad!
- Okay.

06:46.101 --> 06:49.539
Your grandson would like us
to make peace.

06:49.583 --> 06:52.455
So, do you apologize
for being the worst father

06:52.499 --> 06:54.457
in the history in the world?
Even worse than fathers

06:54.501 --> 06:56.154
who chain their children
in basements?

06:56.198 --> 06:58.243
- I do not.
- That's on him. I tried.

06:58.287 --> 07:00.289
- I really don't think you did.
- Jake, you don't get it.

07:00.332 --> 07:01.508
He's a heartless jerk.

07:01.551 --> 07:02.857
When I was in high school,
I almost died.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.511
He didn't even visit me
in the hospital.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.426
- Okay, so maybe
start by asking him

07:06.469 --> 07:07.949
to apologize for that.

07:07.992 --> 07:11.300
- No, he should apologize to me
for being in the hospital.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.041
- I'm starting to see
the heartless thing now.

07:13.084 --> 07:16.044
- Growing up, he had a boat.
Meant everything to him.

07:16.087 --> 07:18.133
He named it "Walter,"
after himself.

07:18.176 --> 07:19.656
- She was the child
I never had.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.963
- I was the child you did have.

07:22.006 --> 07:24.400
Anyway, one day I took
Walter Junior out for a spin.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.055
I was trying to impress
one of the lake girls.

07:27.098 --> 07:29.536
Before I met your mom, I was
a bit of a ladies' man.

07:29.579 --> 07:31.538
- Yes, that continued
long after you met my mom.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.540
- He's always been a floozy.
- It was dark.

07:33.583 --> 07:36.238
I crashed into the dock;
I woke up in the hospital.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.544
- How was the girl?
- Flexible.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.241
Man, she could put her leg--
total--

07:39.284 --> 07:40.634
- No, I was--
after the accident.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.026
- Oh, right!
No.

07:42.070 --> 07:43.245
She was totally unhurt,
thank goodness.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.899
But I was in the hospital
for three weeks,

07:44.942 --> 07:48.119
and Admiral Ass
never visited me once.

07:48.163 --> 07:50.470
- I warned you
not to take the boat out.

07:50.513 --> 07:53.168
You make mistakes, you got
to accept the consequences.

07:53.211 --> 07:55.692
- I'm your son!
- And Walter was my daughter.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.477
- Okay, both of you, stop.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.261
You're acting like children.
You know what?

07:59.304 --> 08:01.219
That's it, if you're gonna
act like kids,

08:01.263 --> 08:03.265
then I'm gonna act
like a parent.

08:03.308 --> 08:05.136
- "Cry Hard with a Vengeance"?
- Yeah.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.356
It's Bruce Willis' book
about parenting.

08:07.399 --> 08:09.053
And we're gonna read it.

08:09.097 --> 08:12.274
- I just got another call from
the saddest ADA in the world.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.319
He's still pissed.
Did Hitchcock and Scully

08:14.363 --> 08:15.799
get anywhere?
- Hard to say.

08:15.843 --> 08:19.063
Their file contains a lot
of non-case related documents.

08:19.107 --> 08:20.238
- A bunch of menus?

08:20.282 --> 08:22.110
- A cease and desist letter
from TJ Maxx.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.459
- Multiple patent submissions

08:23.503 --> 08:25.069
for something called
a "pillow shoe."

08:25.113 --> 08:27.202
- An application
for a time share in Figi.

08:27.245 --> 08:29.987
- You mean Fiji.
- No, Figi with a G.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.381
They're getting scammed.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.339
- Wait.
This is good.

08:34.383 --> 08:36.037
There was a witness
who saw everything.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.300
Identified the thief, they even
described the getaway car down

08:38.343 --> 08:40.128
to a dent in the right bumper.
We're golden.

08:40.171 --> 08:42.217
- Yeah, but Hitchcock
and Scully forgot to write down

08:42.260 --> 08:44.088
the witness' name
or contact info.

08:44.132 --> 08:46.526
- What?
No, that's insane.

08:46.569 --> 08:48.397
Even they wouldn't
do something that dumb.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.573
- Dumb?
Excuse me.

08:50.617 --> 08:51.966
I don't need this crap.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.576
I could be on the beach
in Figi right now.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.317
- If we go to court,
we're gonna need

08:55.360 --> 08:56.579
the witness to testify.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.712
But now, we have no way
of contacting him.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.409
So there's no case.

09:00.452 --> 09:03.107
How could you not take down
the witness' contact info?

09:03.151 --> 09:06.067
- Well, unlike you dorks,
we don't do everything

09:06.110 --> 09:07.634
"by the book."
- We play by our own rules.

09:07.677 --> 09:09.636
- And we get results.
- Mm-hmm.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.028
- No!
You don't!

09:11.072 --> 09:12.726
That's why we're here!

09:12.769 --> 09:14.379
- So John McClain's advice
wasn't great,

09:14.423 --> 09:16.512
but I have other books.
This one says

09:16.556 --> 09:18.732
to make sure neither
of you has a full diaper.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.342
Feels like we can skip
that part.

09:20.385 --> 09:23.084
- I wouldn't be so sure.
- Dad, come on, all right?

09:23.127 --> 09:24.738
How about this?

09:24.781 --> 09:27.001
Dad, just name one happy memory
that you have with Grandpa.

09:27.044 --> 09:29.307
And don't say the memory you're
going to have at his funeral.

09:29.351 --> 09:32.615
- All right, when I was eight,
he was on shore leave,

09:32.659 --> 09:36.663
and we played catch
in the yard, and that was fun.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.534
- Hey, there you go.
That was great.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.363
And Grandpa, is there a happy
memory you want to share?

09:41.406 --> 09:43.495
- Well, can I pick
the catch thing too?

09:43.539 --> 09:44.801
- Yeah, sure.
- 'Cause that was really

09:44.845 --> 09:46.760
a nice time.
While we were playing,

09:46.803 --> 09:48.631
the neighbor kid
fell off his bike.

09:48.675 --> 09:51.199
- Yeah, he broke his arm.
- You could see the bone.

09:51.242 --> 09:52.722
Do you remember when we went

09:52.766 --> 09:55.203
skiing, and the guy fell off
the lift and busted his leg?

09:55.246 --> 09:56.770
- And you could see the bone.
- It was just, like,

09:56.813 --> 09:59.816
sticking right out of the skin,
and he's, like, screaming.

09:59.860 --> 10:02.166
We were laughing.
- Oh, oh, it was beautiful.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.646
- God, I hope
somebody found him.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.474
- Okay, well, you guys
are both monsters,

10:05.517 --> 10:06.780
but this is going great.

10:09.304 --> 10:10.348
- Yes, yes.

10:10.392 --> 10:11.698
- I know you're being positive,

10:11.741 --> 10:14.222
but I could use
some honest criticism.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.745
- Terry, I'd love
to help, but...

10:17.747 --> 10:20.402
Follow me.

10:20.445 --> 10:21.708
- Hello.

10:21.751 --> 10:23.623
You caught me stretching.
I've been doing this

10:23.666 --> 10:26.234
and nothing else for the
last half hour continuously.

10:26.277 --> 10:27.670
- I saw you watching Terry.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.237
You were finger conducting.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.326
- Fine.

10:31.369 --> 10:32.719
Yes.

10:32.762 --> 10:35.722
I may have overstated
my contempt for the music

10:35.765 --> 10:38.463
they play so that I wouldn't
have to help Jeffords.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.683
- Oh, no, am I so bad,
I can't be helped?

10:40.727 --> 10:43.164
Aw, man, I wanted to play
in the Thanksgiving Day Parade.

10:43.207 --> 10:44.687
Terry loves being
in and among floats.

10:44.731 --> 10:47.168
- You're not bad.
You're maybe even...

10:47.211 --> 10:49.083
Good.
But to make you great,

10:49.126 --> 10:52.260
I'd have to break you down
to nothing.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.610
It would ruin our friendship.
- I can handle criticism.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.394
My daughters criticize me
all the time.

10:56.438 --> 10:58.614
They're so mean now.
Please help me, sir, please!

10:58.658 --> 11:00.703
- Okay.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.487
Give me your flute.

11:02.531 --> 11:04.315
Wrong!
First rule:

11:04.359 --> 11:08.711
never give anyone your flute.

11:08.755 --> 11:11.235
- Hey, babe, how's it going?
- Amazingly well.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.107
My dad and my grandpa are
actually getting along.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.456
They've been catching up
nonstop.

11:14.499 --> 11:15.587
- Aunt Millie?
- Dead.

11:15.631 --> 11:16.763
- Uncle Thomas?
- Dead.

11:16.806 --> 11:17.764
- Aunt Janet?
- Dead.

11:17.807 --> 11:18.765
- Uncle Dean?
- Gay.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.114
- Ooh, good for him.

11:20.157 --> 11:21.593
What about Aunt Lyn?
- Dead.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.595
- Apparently there was a fire
at the family reunion.

11:23.639 --> 11:25.859
Lucky for my Uncle Dean, he
was not welcome at the event.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.861
- Wow. Dark.
- Yeah.

11:27.904 --> 11:30.124
- Well, I'm glad
everything's working out.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.734
Oh, I got to go.
Love you, bye.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.127
- Actually, I got
to go too, so...

11:34.650 --> 11:37.609
- I didn't even think
it was possible to put a cast

11:37.653 --> 11:39.916
on that part of the body.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.788
- That was Amy.
I hung up first.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.703
Looks like things are
still going great in here.

11:43.746 --> 11:46.270
- Yeah, they sure are.
Hey, Dad, toss me a beer.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.663
Bring the heat.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.273
Whoa!
both:

11:49.317 --> 11:50.361
- No, the sex reveal cake!
- Oh.

11:50.405 --> 11:51.580
- Nobody look at the floor!

11:51.623 --> 11:53.190
No one can see
the color of the cake.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.238
- How long are we doing this?
What's the plan?

11:57.281 --> 11:58.326
- I don't know yet!

12:01.329 --> 12:03.113
- Okay, we all heard
the cake splat

12:03.157 --> 12:04.636
on the other side
of the counter,

12:04.680 --> 12:06.116
which means we can probably
assume you can see the color.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.683
- Why does that matter?
- Because the color of the cake

12:07.727 --> 12:09.163
tells us if we're having
a boy or a girl.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.294
- How can that baker tell?

12:10.338 --> 12:11.818
- Because the baker
does the test.

12:11.861 --> 12:12.993
- No, the doctor does the test.
Then the doctor calls

12:13.036 --> 12:14.864
the baker, and the baker
makes the cake.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.866
- Okay, I hate to say this,
but can you start over?

12:16.910 --> 12:18.389
- No, we don't have time.
Just help me fix this.

12:18.433 --> 12:19.782
- You know, it's Roger's fault.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.305
All he had to do
was catch the beer.

12:21.349 --> 12:23.133
- Well, maybe I'd be better
at catch if I played it

12:23.177 --> 12:25.875
more than once growing up.
- Guys, focus up.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.398
We're all getting along,
remember?

12:27.442 --> 12:29.749
Now, we can't see the cake
before Amy, which means we have

12:29.792 --> 12:31.794
to figure out a way to clean
it up without looking at it.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.796
We have to "Birdbox" it.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.146
- And "Birdbox" is the bakery.
- No, "Birdbox" is a movie

12:36.190 --> 12:37.974
where people aren't allowed
to look at things.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.716
Just put on these blindfolds
and help me clean it up.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.979
- I "Birdbox-ed"
the stewardess in Sweden once.

12:43.023 --> 12:43.980
- Dad!

12:45.025 --> 12:47.679
Okay, that should be all of it.

12:47.723 --> 12:49.986
I think it's safe
to take off our blindfolds--

12:50.030 --> 12:51.031
Oh, !

12:51.074 --> 12:53.947
No, no!
Oh, God!

12:55.078 --> 12:57.341
What happened?
We were so careful.

12:57.385 --> 12:59.039
Here comes the mop.

12:59.082 --> 13:00.214
- Bag.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.389
- This is hard.
- Yeah.

13:01.432 --> 13:04.174
I could use a beer, you know?

13:04.218 --> 13:05.828
- Oh, oh.
- You okay?

13:05.872 --> 13:07.047
- The cake was blue.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.266
You're having a boy.
It's the curse.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.181
- No.
No, no, no, there's no curse.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.793
Look, we can still fix this.
All we have to do is clean

13:13.836 --> 13:16.099
every inch of this room,
and then bake a gourmet cake.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.058
- No one can do all that
in two hours.

13:18.101 --> 13:20.190
- Wrong, Dad.

13:20.234 --> 13:21.452
There is one who can.

13:24.238 --> 13:27.023
- Hello, fellas.
Let's get to work.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.506
- Oh, hey.
I got something.

13:31.549 --> 13:33.987
There was a security camera by
the Carroll Street brownstone.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.162
- And it got footage
of the perps?

13:35.205 --> 13:36.772
- No, but it caught
Scully and Hitchcock

13:36.816 --> 13:38.165
interviewing the witness.
- All right.

13:38.208 --> 13:39.862
Let's start canvassing
the neighborhood,

13:39.906 --> 13:41.168
see if anybody
recognizes that guy.

13:41.211 --> 13:42.212
- Yeah.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.258
- Wait!

13:44.301 --> 13:46.434
- What the hell?
- Sorry, I didn't want to run,

13:46.477 --> 13:48.218
and that was the only way
to stop the doors.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.786
- It wasn't, and it didn't.
- It worked, we're here.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.483
- Please, don't go looking
for that witness.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.094
- We're just trying
to fix your screw-up.

13:54.137 --> 13:56.226
- We didn't screw up.
The witness gave us his name,

13:56.270 --> 13:58.838
but he asked us not to write it
down because he's undocumented.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.884
- So he's scared to show up
to testify at the courthouse

14:01.928 --> 14:03.407
because he didn't want
to be detained by ICE.

14:03.451 --> 14:04.713
- Damn it.
- You know,

14:04.756 --> 14:06.497
that keeps lots of immigrants
from helping cops.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.195
- Yeah, we know that.
We're just surprised

14:08.238 --> 14:09.849
that you know that.
- That's insulting.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.502
I'm very concerned
with immigration issues.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.504
- And I've dated
my fair share of spicy--

14:13.548 --> 14:15.245
- No!
- Scully said the nice thing.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.117
You don't need
to go past it, Hitchcock.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.815
- Okay, I know you need help
and time is tight,

14:19.859 --> 14:21.425
but I see there is blue cake
on the floor,

14:21.469 --> 14:23.775
and I know what that means,
vis-à-vis the sex of the baby.

14:23.819 --> 14:27.040
So before we do anything,
I'm going to need a minute.

14:28.476 --> 14:30.521
Sorry for all the weeping
and the weird snort noise

14:30.565 --> 14:32.088
I made at the end.
It's genetic.

14:32.132 --> 14:34.482
Now, Jake, grab the mop,
you're on cleanup.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.179
Admiral, you're
making the batter.

14:36.223 --> 14:38.442
Captain, you're on
frosting duty.

14:39.617 --> 14:41.402
- Okay, Amy just texted.

14:41.445 --> 14:43.926
She's gonna be here
any second, so hide that thing.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.493
- The...

14:45.536 --> 14:48.931
Oh.
- Dad, that is so noticeable.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.106
- Nuh-uh, it's awesome.

14:50.150 --> 14:51.455
- All right, everybody,
act normal.

14:51.499 --> 14:52.587
Act normal.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.328
- Hey, guys.

14:54.371 --> 14:56.199
- Hey, welcome home.

14:56.243 --> 14:58.898
I'd like you to meet
my grandpa, Walter.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.334
- It's so nice to meet you.

15:00.377 --> 15:02.118
- Hello, things are
normal here.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.815
- Yeah, everything's
totally normal...

15:03.859 --> 15:05.165
Back here too,
behind the chair.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.949
- Yup, and that was
a normal thing to say.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.298
Are things normal
with you, Amy?

15:08.342 --> 15:09.604
- Sure.
- Cool.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.954
- I'm going to go get ready
for the party.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.216
- Oh, fun.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.135
Oh, my God, I can't believe
we pulled it off.

15:19.179 --> 15:20.658
Charles, we owe it all to you.

15:20.702 --> 15:23.270
- Stop, it was an honor to cook
and clean with all of you.

15:23.313 --> 15:26.403
- Boy, Jake is so lucky
to have you as his butler.

15:26.447 --> 15:27.404
- Oh, he's not--
- Thank you.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.492
- Oh.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.407
- I'm so glad
you're helping me.

15:30.451 --> 15:31.887
Maybe I won't blow it
after all.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.149
- Oh, you'll do
plenty of blowing...

15:33.193 --> 15:34.498
Of that flute.
Now, let's go.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.500
A five, six, seven, eight.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.112
- Stop.

15:39.155 --> 15:41.331
The nod meant start now,
not start one second later.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.072
Again.
Five, six, seven, eight.

15:44.639 --> 15:45.640
- Stop.

15:47.555 --> 15:49.600
Are you playing "The Muffin
Man" or "The Garbage Man"?

15:49.644 --> 15:51.341
- Huh?
- Do you know the Garbage Man?

15:51.385 --> 15:52.429
Because I do.

15:52.473 --> 15:53.909
Because I'm looking
right at him.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.650
Again.
Five, six, seven, eight.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.176
- ♪ Bum, bum, bum,
badum, bum, bum ♪

16:02.657 --> 16:04.267
Again.

16:06.313 --> 16:07.401
Again.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.055
♪ Bum, bum, bum,
badum, bum, bum ♪

16:11.231 --> 16:12.493
♪ Da, da, da, da

16:12.536 --> 16:14.060
Why did you stop playing,
Garbage Man?

16:14.103 --> 16:15.539
- I need some water.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.367
- What you need to do is
keep practicing, Garbage Man.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.629
- I don't have any more saliva.
- And I don't have any more

16:18.673 --> 16:21.284
time for your excuses,
Garbage Man.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.156
Now play again.
Five, six--

16:23.199 --> 16:24.548
- I don't want
your help anymore!

16:24.592 --> 16:28.944
I'm not a garbage man!
I'm a muffin man!

16:30.206 --> 16:31.599
- Attention, everyone.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.209
Thank you all so much
for coming.

16:33.253 --> 16:34.384
Please gather around.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.908
We're going to cut the cake
and find out

16:36.952 --> 16:40.651
what our baby's whole
downstairs situation is.

16:40.695 --> 16:42.523
- Why the accent?
- I don't know.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.046
I did so bad.
I should have let you talk.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.221
- Yeah, you should have.
- Okay.

16:45.265 --> 16:46.309
- I love you.
- Oh.

16:46.353 --> 16:47.397
- Okay, let's do this.

16:47.441 --> 16:49.225
Here we go.

16:49.269 --> 16:52.620
- All right, we are having a...

16:52.663 --> 16:54.578
Green.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.145
Oh, my God.
What's inside of me?

16:56.189 --> 16:58.582
- No, you just cut a bad slice.
Here, I'll get a good one.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.280
- I guess the bakery
must have messed up.

17:00.323 --> 17:01.629
- What are you talking about?

17:01.672 --> 17:03.500
Roger's the one that
added the food coloring.

17:03.544 --> 17:04.936
- Well, you mixed the batter.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.590
- Wait, did you guys
bake that cake?

17:06.634 --> 17:10.203
- Well, we just,
you could say that...

17:10.246 --> 17:11.595
- Jake?

17:11.639 --> 17:13.249
- Okay, fine.
Yes, we baked it.

17:13.293 --> 17:15.121
I'm so sorry.
I'll explain everything later.

17:15.164 --> 17:16.470
Dad, please stop
cutting the cake.

17:16.513 --> 17:17.688
- I'm trying to find
a good slice.

17:17.732 --> 17:20.387
- There is no good slice!
You screwed it up!

17:20.430 --> 17:21.910
You're a screw-up!
- Yeah?

17:21.953 --> 17:23.955
Well, if I'm a screw up,
it's 'cause you screwed me up.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.305
You screw-up.
- Screw you.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.307
I'm leaving.
- Wait, wait, no, don't go!

17:27.350 --> 17:28.351
We reversed the curse!

17:28.395 --> 17:29.570
Don't reverse
the curse reverse!

17:29.613 --> 17:31.224
- Actually, Jake,
I'm going too.

17:31.267 --> 17:32.573
- What?
No, why would you go?

17:32.616 --> 17:34.183
- I need to go to the hospital.

17:34.227 --> 17:35.358
I cut my thumb off.

17:35.402 --> 17:36.968
- Again?
- The other one.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.100
all:

17:38.144 --> 17:40.407
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

17:40.450 --> 17:43.018
Ah...
Get the "Dino Bites."

17:45.716 --> 17:48.197
- Hey, how are you feeling?
How's the thumb?

17:48.241 --> 17:50.547
- Great, looks perfect.
Like nothing ever happened.

17:50.591 --> 17:53.594
- It's the other thumb, Dad.
- Oh, no, yeah, that looks bad.

17:53.637 --> 17:55.596
- The doctor said it might
take a long time to heal,

17:55.639 --> 17:57.554
and that it might
never be as long again.

17:57.598 --> 17:59.817
- My thumb?
I don't care.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.602
Is my dad here?
- No.

18:01.645 --> 18:04.431
I called him and he said...

18:04.474 --> 18:05.910
How do I put this?

18:05.954 --> 18:08.565
- That I'm a useless screw-up
and he's done with me?

18:08.609 --> 18:10.785
- Yeah, something exactly
like that, verbatim, sure.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.787
Look, I'm really sorry
that I forced this

18:12.830 --> 18:15.442
whole reunion on you.
I think our family might be

18:15.485 --> 18:16.878
cursed, and I'm going
to be a bad dad.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.619
- No, I was wrong.

18:18.662 --> 18:22.797
There's no curse.
My dad is just a selfish dick.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.842
And I was too.

18:24.886 --> 18:27.802
All the other Peralta dads,
we probably just learned it

18:27.845 --> 18:30.109
from each other.
- Or it's just in our genes.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.893
- No, you proved that wrong.

18:31.936 --> 18:34.678
You care, and you do the work.

18:34.722 --> 18:38.552
You're reading parenting books
before your kid is even born.

18:38.595 --> 18:41.120
You tried to get me
and Dad back together.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.470
Hell, you even fished
my thumb out of the cake.

18:43.513 --> 18:44.688
- Yeah, that was gross.

18:44.732 --> 18:46.037
- You're so excited
about having a kid,

18:46.081 --> 18:47.648
you're having
a sex reveal party.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.215
I never did anything like that,

18:49.258 --> 18:50.825
except that one time
in Amsterdam.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.653
- I really wish you'd stop
bringing that up.

18:52.696 --> 18:55.003
- Jake, you're going
to be a great dad.

18:55.046 --> 18:57.832
And your son's
gonna love you.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.529
- Thanks.

18:59.573 --> 19:02.053
And I think you're going
to make a real good grandpa.

19:02.097 --> 19:03.229
- Hey,

19:03.272 --> 19:05.840
who's got two surgically
reattached thumbs

19:05.883 --> 19:08.234
and is super proud of his son?

19:08.277 --> 19:10.018
- Oh, you don't have to--

19:10.061 --> 19:11.237
- This guy--

19:15.241 --> 19:16.633
- My boss is furious.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.200
You ruined my 25th birthday.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.810
I want those guys punished.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.638
- Understood.
I'll talk to them right now.

19:21.682 --> 19:24.598
Without that witness,
the DA has nothing.

19:24.641 --> 19:26.165
Kurm is pissed.
- It's true.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.905
He kept calling you guys
the human centipede.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.603
- Because we have
our heads up our asses.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.735
Yes, we've heard that before.
- I never thought I'd say this,

19:31.779 --> 19:33.041
but you guys did
the right thing.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.738
- Unfortunately, Kurm
wants you disciplined.

19:34.782 --> 19:36.000
So effective tomorrow,

19:36.044 --> 19:38.002
you're each getting one week
paid suspension.

19:38.046 --> 19:40.614
- Like vacation?
- You deserve this punishment!

19:40.657 --> 19:42.572
-  It's punishment
where you don't have to work.

19:42.616 --> 19:43.704
- And we can go
anywhere we like?

19:43.747 --> 19:45.271
- You can go to hell
for all I care!

19:45.314 --> 19:47.055
-  Or to a resort
where you're being scammed.

19:47.098 --> 19:48.187
- Figi.
Good idea.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.231
- Now, get out of my face!

19:49.275 --> 19:50.711
Have fun.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.715
- Next.

19:54.758 --> 19:57.674
- Hi, my name is
Terry Jeffords.

19:57.718 --> 19:59.633
And I don't know how
this is going to go--

19:59.676 --> 20:00.982
- Wait!

20:01.025 --> 20:02.375
- Sir.

20:02.418 --> 20:04.203
- I'm Captain Raymond Holt
of the 99th precinct,

20:04.246 --> 20:05.943
and I need to tell you
about this man.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.945
Now, the audition piece
he's about to play may not

20:07.989 --> 20:10.774
be technically perfect.
In fact, it may hurt your ears.

20:10.818 --> 20:13.081
You may consider it
an insult to music.

20:13.124 --> 20:14.691
You may whisper to each other,

20:14.735 --> 20:15.953
"'Muffin Man'?
Pssh!

20:15.997 --> 20:17.607
More like Garbage Man."

20:17.651 --> 20:19.261
- Come on.
- But you would be wrong.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.611
This man has
taught me something.

20:21.655 --> 20:24.745
He's taught me that music
is about heart and soul.

20:24.788 --> 20:28.618
It's about perseverance.
Despite everything

20:28.662 --> 20:31.882
I put him through,
he showed up here today.

20:31.926 --> 20:35.364
And you would be a fool
not to put him in your band.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.627
- Thank you, Captain.
Lieutenant?

20:37.671 --> 20:38.889
What instrument do you play?

20:38.933 --> 20:40.195
- The flute.
- You're hired.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.805
- What?
I haven't even played.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.285
- You're the only flute
who auditioned.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.286
Welcome to the band.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.114
- Yes!
I did it!

20:47.420 --> 20:48.812
- Hey.
How's your dad doing?

20:48.856 --> 20:50.292
- Well, the doctor
said he'll be okay,

20:50.336 --> 20:52.120
but his hands are
basically claws now.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.687
I don't know why
they think that's okay.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.776
Hey, listen, I'm sorry
the cake was green.

20:55.819 --> 20:57.038
- It's okay.

20:57.081 --> 20:58.692
I'll love our little Shrek
no matter what.

20:58.735 --> 20:59.823
- Oh, my God.
That's right.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.172
You still don't know
the sex of the baby.

21:01.216 --> 21:02.783
With all the craziness,
I almost forgot.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.698
Emphasis on "almost."
- What?

21:04.741 --> 21:06.961
- Well, I got another cake
just for the two of us.

21:07.004 --> 21:09.050
- Jake, that's so sweet.

21:09.093 --> 21:11.835
- Here we go.
- I'm so excited.

21:11.879 --> 21:13.228
It's empty.
There's no cake inside.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.664
- What?
Where'd it go?

21:14.708 --> 21:16.318
- Hey, guys.
Do you have any milk?

21:16.362 --> 21:18.320
We're having a boy?

21:18.364 --> 21:19.843
- We're having a boy!

21:19.887 --> 21:21.976
- Hey, do you have milk or not?

21:22.019 --> 21:23.238
- Jeez.
- God.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.240
- Fremulon.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.286
- Not a doctor.
- Shh!
