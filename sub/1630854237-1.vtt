Jack.
<i>Previously on "Station 19"...</i>

00:05.339 --> 00:07.175
I wasn't adopted. I grew up
with our parents.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.677
I was demoted. I made a decision
on a call

00:09.710 --> 00:11.579
that went against
what my chief had ordered.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.514
So, insubordination.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.683
I want my job back. I know
you two are sleeping together.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.751
I want my job back,
or I'm going to report you.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.388

Republican, are you?

00:20.421 --> 00:22.823

Independent.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.425
Ooh!
Yes!

00:24.458 --> 00:25.993
I didn't run
right into the fire

00:26.026 --> 00:27.595
when I was
specifically told not to.

00:27.628 --> 00:30.731
It was all because of this woman
and the family

00:30.764 --> 00:33.201
who I so desperately
want to stick around for.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.602
I don't have to go to trial.
It's over.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.036

- Wow.

your stance on taxes.

your toes?

09:21.094 --> 09:23.296
My-- My hand really hurts.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.733
Alright.
It's probably air-bag burn.

09:25.766 --> 09:26.900
What about the other one?

09:26.934 --> 09:30.203
Um, yeah, it-- it hurts.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.707
I think.
But, actually, I'm not sure.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.943
Sorry. Sorry. That was just--

09:35.976 --> 09:37.945
That was just really scary,
and I can't think.
I know. I know.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.947
I'm sure it was scary.
Hey, can you do me a favor

09:39.980 --> 09:41.649
and turn your car off?

09:41.682 --> 09:43.717
Alright, see if you
can turn your--

09:46.353 --> 09:47.755
What is that?

09:52.693 --> 09:54.494
Oh, my God.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.132
Is that a--

09:59.166 --> 10:00.433
Tornado.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.771
Tornado!

10:03.804 --> 10:05.773
Everybody take cover!

10:13.947 --> 10:17.150
I think that is the problem
with owning a boat, yeah.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.919
Can I grab a photo
of you two?
Oh.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.087
Great. Just one shot.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.190
There's a seat
on the school board

10:23.223 --> 10:25.592
with your name on it, Norton.
Oh, wow.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.962
And, yet, I-I do think we need
to remember that, uh, most--

10:31.965 --> 10:34.134
What the hell is that?

10:34.167 --> 10:35.769
That's a tornado warning.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.838
In Seattle?
That's got to be a mistake.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.372
Let's act like it's not.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.308
Alright, everybody,
calm down.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.143
Enjoy the party.
We're gonna call the city

10:43.176 --> 10:45.178
and make sure--
Everyone, we are moving inside!

10:45.212 --> 10:47.948
If there is a basement,
that is where you are headed!

10:47.981 --> 10:50.517
Please start moving in
right now.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.519
This is absurd, Montgomery.
It's just a little windy.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.688
Sir, film later.
Move now.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.523
Dixon, you, too. Go!

10:56.556 --> 10:59.159
Nice and orderly.
Let's move, everybody!

10:59.192 --> 11:00.660
Let's go!

11:00.694 --> 11:02.395
Let's go, ma'am.
You got the shot.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.964
Let's go.
Let's go.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.301
Everyone stay calm!

11:08.335 --> 11:11.071
- Grab the kids!
- Everyone calm down!

11:11.104 --> 11:13.006
That's not gonna happen!

11:13.040 --> 11:15.008
- I can't find her!
- Inside! Inside!

11:15.042 --> 11:17.044
Everybody, inside your homes!

11:17.077 --> 11:19.146
Get inside!

11:19.179 --> 11:20.680
Go home! Go inside!

11:20.714 --> 11:22.582
- Chief, take cover!
- Come on, come on,

11:22.615 --> 11:24.084
come on, come on!

11:24.117 --> 11:26.887
- Ruiz, now!
- Alright, guys.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.822
Get me out of here!
Hallie!

11:28.856 --> 11:29.923
Get me out of here.
Hallie. Hallie, I need you

11:29.957 --> 11:31.591
to protect your head, okay?

11:31.624 --> 11:32.993
Herrera!
Cover your head.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.728
Alright, Hallie?
Cover your head.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.396
Oh, God! I'm trapped!

11:36.429 --> 11:38.231
I'll come back for you!
Cover your head!

11:38.265 --> 11:40.100
We can't help her.
You need to take cover.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.668
No!

11:41.701 --> 11:44.537
Stay low. Follow me.
Let's move.

11:44.571 --> 11:48.341
Ruiz, hurry! Come on!
Come on!

11:48.375 --> 11:50.844
Theo!

11:50.878 --> 11:52.846
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

11:52.880 --> 11:55.248
Get down, get down!

11:55.282 --> 11:58.585
Oh, hey, hey!
No, don't go that way!

11:58.618 --> 12:00.020
Theo, come on!

12:00.053 --> 12:02.089
Head down!

12:02.122 --> 12:03.791
I'm getting out of here!
Stop!

12:03.824 --> 12:06.093
Aah!

12:06.126 --> 12:08.361
19, take cover!

12:08.395 --> 12:09.729
Ruiz, now!

12:09.763 --> 12:10.898
Alright, come on!

12:10.931 --> 12:13.300
Get down!

12:13.333 --> 12:14.601
No, ma'am, I don't know
if it's real.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.436
But, look, you should
get in your basement

12:16.469 --> 12:18.271
and stay away from windows
until the alarm stops.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.808
W-What's happening?
It's a tornado warning.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.275
What? In Seattle?

12:22.309 --> 12:24.444
Is it-- Is it a drill?
I don't know.

12:24.477 --> 12:27.247
Well, I might be pregnant.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.216
Right.
You can't-- No, no. No--

12:29.249 --> 12:31.584
We'll be fine. We'll be fine.
Ugh!

12:31.618 --> 12:33.787
It's crazy.
I don't even understand this.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.422
Just come behind me.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.257
Honey, let's go outside.
Come on.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.395
Okay, well,
if there's no basement,

12:42.429 --> 12:43.897
can we at least get
another round of drinks?

12:43.931 --> 12:45.465
Alright, everyone go
to the center of the house.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.100
Everybody go to the center
of the house right now

12:47.134 --> 12:48.501
and get down.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.137
Stop grandstanding, Montgomery.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.905
The sun is out.
Okay, under an archway,

12:51.939 --> 12:53.773
a bathroom, a closet.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.275
Okay, this is ridiculous.
Let's go, Kitty.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.676
Come on.
I want to see what happens.

12:56.709 --> 13:00.280
Cover your heads with your hands
and get down.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.448
Please.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.817
Get down.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.788
Oh.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.157
It's really a tornado.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.126
It is.
It really is.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.597
Wow. You know, I have three kids
and a wife.

13:17.630 --> 13:21.168
I have a beautiful 3-year-old
who already lost her dad.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.802
And I am following
the rules.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.537
I-I am on desk duty
most of the time

13:24.571 --> 13:27.374
because I didn't want her
to lose another dad.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.709
I might get taken out
by an act of God anyway.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.513
Life is terrifying
and cruel.

13:33.546 --> 13:36.984
And-- And why do we
bring children into it?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.823
Oh, my God! Aah!

13:43.857 --> 13:46.726
No! What's happening?

13:46.759 --> 13:48.328
Everybody keep
their heads down. Hold tight.

13:48.361 --> 13:51.131
- Cover your head.
- Keep breathing.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.632
Stay low, stay low, stay low.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.801
No, no, no, no, no.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.503
Herrera, head down!

13:56.536 --> 13:58.972
We shouldn't have left her
in the car.

14:03.043 --> 14:06.246
Oh, my God. There it is.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.814
I can see it. It's real.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.983
What?
The tornado.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.584
And it's headed this way.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.653
So what do we do?
Right about now, you pray.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.722
Everybody stay down!

14:23.796 --> 14:25.265
I think that was it.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.767
I think we're alright.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.003
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.007
- You alright?
- You okay?

14:34.041 --> 14:35.408
- Come on.
- Here! Over here!

14:35.442 --> 14:37.410
I think I got hit
by something.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.511
- I can't find him.
- Oh, Hughes, give me a hand.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.746
Give me a hand.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.264
Hallie?
We need more aid cars.

14:57.297 --> 15:00.900
I'm coming.
Hang on, Hallie. I'm coming.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.303
- Are you okay, honey?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

15:03.336 --> 15:06.739
- We need some help.
- Hallie.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.076
- Where the hell did she go?
- We got it stabilized.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.911
- Yep, yep.
- Where the hell did she go?

15:11.945 --> 15:14.081
Her arm was crushed.
She-- She couldn't drive.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.548
We need to tape this up!

15:15.582 --> 15:16.950
You think?

15:16.984 --> 15:18.818
No.
Alright, back up.

15:18.851 --> 15:21.321
No.
Follow me.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.295
I think it passed us.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.562
How do we know for sure?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.198
Everybody stay down.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.444
Hello?

15:44.477 --> 15:46.146
Help!

15:46.179 --> 15:47.847
I-Is someone there?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.349
Hey! Are you okay?

15:52.485 --> 15:53.520
Hey.
Hello?

15:53.553 --> 15:55.755
Where am I?

15:55.788 --> 15:56.956
Don't move.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.459
Where did that come from?

15:59.492 --> 16:01.861
Hey.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.530
What's your name?

16:03.563 --> 16:05.532
Hallie.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.267
With an I-E.

16:15.775 --> 16:16.876
Warren, if you hear anything
over the comms, let me know.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.382
It's a yellow coupe. She's about
mid-30s, average build.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.151
Thanks.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.452
He's leaking brain.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.820
Organ donor at best. Yeah.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.989
Captain, we're out.

16:30.023 --> 16:33.726
Ruiz, 88 is sending an aid car
but don't know how long.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.829
Alright, Eduardo, I'm not
gonna take this thing out of you

16:36.863 --> 16:38.231
'cause I don't want to cause
any further damage.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.832
We're gonna get you
to the hospital,

16:39.866 --> 16:41.368
and they're gonna
figure it out, alright?

16:41.401 --> 16:43.603
I ran the stop sign.
It was me.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.574
It happens.
I ran the stop sign,

16:47.607 --> 16:50.077
and the lady got blown away
by a tornado.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.644
Hey, it's not
cause and effect, man.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.580
You ran a stop sign,
and you hit her, yeah,

16:53.613 --> 16:56.049
but no one saw
a tornado coming today, huh?

16:56.083 --> 16:57.217
There wasn't even
a warning siren

16:57.250 --> 16:59.219
till after the tornado
touched down.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.020
Dispatch,
this is Engine 19.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.889
Any word
on a yellow coupe

17:02.922 --> 17:05.192
with a 35-year-old
woman inside of it?

17:05.225 --> 17:07.494
<i>Herrera, this is Chief Ross.
We have your vehicle.</i>

17:07.527 --> 17:08.595
<i>It dropped out of the sky
on Hawkins Street.</i>

17:08.628 --> 17:10.497
Are you serious?

17:10.530 --> 17:13.032
<i>Strangest day I ever had
on this job.</i>

17:13.066 --> 17:14.334
Is-- Is the driver--

17:14.367 --> 17:17.003
<i>Alive and stable, yeah.</i>

17:17.036 --> 17:18.871
How? Uh-- Uh-- What?

17:18.905 --> 17:22.075
<i>Strangest day ever.</i>

17:22.109 --> 17:24.711
Oh, my God.

17:24.744 --> 17:28.515
Hallie? An ambulance is gonna
come as soon as it can, okay?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.117
Are you gonna get me out?

17:30.150 --> 17:31.618
I-I can't do that
without equipment,

17:31.651 --> 17:32.952
but I'm gonna stay
right here with you

17:32.985 --> 17:34.621
until they show up, okay?

17:34.654 --> 17:37.224
I have to call Adam.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.526
I hope he's not mad
about the car.

17:39.559 --> 17:43.396
I'm sure all he cares about
is that you're okay.

17:43.430 --> 17:46.933
Was I in a tornado?
In-- In my car?

17:46.966 --> 17:49.302
You were.
And you survived.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.404
You're some kind
of miracle woman.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.706
Oh, my God.
I-I have to get out of here.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.243
I-I can't stay in here. What if
the tornado comes back?

17:56.276 --> 17:57.277
Hallie, Hallie, look, look.
If you move,

17:57.310 --> 17:59.112
you could make it worse, alright?

17:59.146 --> 18:01.214
So look at me. I need you
to stay calm, alright?

18:01.248 --> 18:02.782
Okay.
Okay.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.984
Okay. You alright?

18:05.017 --> 18:06.419
No, I need to call Adam!

18:06.453 --> 18:08.588
Okay. Hey, can someone
get me a crowbar

18:08.621 --> 18:12.392
and just any other tools
that you may have?

18:12.425 --> 18:13.593
Just--
Alright, hey, Hallie, Hallie--

18:13.626 --> 18:15.162
Hey, listen.
Are you and Adam married?

18:15.195 --> 18:16.429
Yeah.
Yeah?

18:16.463 --> 18:18.498
Yeah.
When'd you get married?

18:18.531 --> 18:20.333
A year ago.
Just a year?

18:20.367 --> 18:22.435
Yeah, but we've been
together for five.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.736
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.173
Where'd you get married?

18:26.206 --> 18:28.341
My parents' backyard.
Oh, really?

18:28.375 --> 18:30.577
Yeah. It was--
It was really small,

18:30.610 --> 18:32.945
but, uh, it was
the best day of my life.

18:32.979 --> 18:34.481
God, I always hated it

18:34.514 --> 18:36.316
when women said that
about their wedding day.

18:36.349 --> 18:39.352
Like, nothing better
has ever happened to you

18:39.386 --> 18:42.155
except landing a husband?

18:42.189 --> 18:43.923
But being there
with everyone I love

18:43.956 --> 18:47.594
and everyone he loves,

18:47.627 --> 18:50.463
telling them about our love,
it was--

18:50.497 --> 18:53.166
I don't know. It was just really
the best day of my life.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.303
I just-- I need--
I need to call him.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.471
I know.
I-I need to get out of here.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.207
Hey, hey--
What if the tornado comes back?!

19:00.240 --> 19:03.009
Hallie, it's not coming back.
I have a crowbar here.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.212
And I brought my toolbox
and first-aid kit.

19:05.245 --> 19:08.114
And for what it's worth, son,
you have my vote.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.317
Thank you, sir. Will you go
grab a table from over there?

19:10.350 --> 19:12.319
Alright? We need to keep
her spine straight.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.620
I need a pair of hands,
somebody strong!

19:13.653 --> 19:15.154
Go, Trevor.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.160
I got you.
You shouldn't try and move her

19:21.194 --> 19:22.662
until the paramedics arrive.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.397
I <i>am</i> a paramedic.

19:24.431 --> 19:25.832
You don't have
the proper equipment.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.033
Please get me out!

19:27.066 --> 19:28.235
Okay, okay.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.802
Please get me out.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.204
Alright. Pull this table
all the way in.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.972
Yep, as far as it will go.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.674
Alright, great.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.478
Hey, hey.
Go out to the street,

19:38.511 --> 19:40.046
flag them down,
show them where we are.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.215
On it.
Alright, Hallie.

19:42.249 --> 19:46.386
I'm gonna very, very carefully
lift you onto this table.

19:46.419 --> 19:49.055
Alright. Nice and easy. Great.

19:49.088 --> 19:51.424
Okay. Right over here. Okay.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.759
We're gonna carry her
on 3. Ready?

19:52.792 --> 19:54.727
1, 2, 3.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.863
Easy. Easy.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.431
Alright.
Be careful, now.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.367
Hallie, I'm gonna find
that phone now.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.670
Okay.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.038
Nice work.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.774
- He was here, right?
- I mean, he's been a--

20:07.807 --> 20:09.442
You're very brave, miss.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.444
Okay, I found it!

20:11.478 --> 20:13.513
It's impressive,
what you just survived.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.781
Alright, dialing.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.082
Where you from, Hallie?

20:16.115 --> 20:18.685
Tacoma.
Beautiful place.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.686
Hey, Adam.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.953
Hey, listen to me.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.889
Hallie is just fine.

20:22.922 --> 20:26.593
She and her car did have
a small run-in with a tornado.

20:26.626 --> 20:29.596
I'm okay, babe.
Yep, she's-- Adam, she's okay.

20:29.629 --> 20:32.198
She's right here.
She wants to talk to you.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.901
Okay.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.202
Hi, babe.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.637
I'm okay.

20:37.670 --> 20:40.773
No, no. I think I'm--
I'm really okay.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.642
Yeah, but the car isn't.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.110
No, I-I love you, too.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.779
Nice trick.
What are you talking about?

20:46.813 --> 20:48.881
Helping someone in crisis? You
should try it once in a while.

20:48.915 --> 20:52.385
No, playing the hero
on-camera.

20:52.419 --> 20:55.555
It's my job. I'm not
as manipulative as you are.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.825
No, your job was
to keep her calm inside there

20:58.858 --> 21:01.127
until the aid car arrived.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.162
You pulled her out for
the cameras, and you know it.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.131
Is he a firefighter?

21:05.164 --> 21:07.266
Guess we're more alike
than you think.

21:15.675 --> 21:18.678
Yeah, okay, alright. Uh, call us
back if you need anything.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.413
Station 19.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.582
Yes-- Yes, ma'am, it was
a tornado. Are you hurt?

21:22.615 --> 21:25.685
Just your feelings. Okay.
Alright, take care.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.320
Hel-- Hello?

21:27.354 --> 21:30.690
Hel-- Yes, sir.
I can hear you.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.759
Well, congratulations. Your
bunker has great cell service.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.494
<i>You got Maya Bishop.
Leave it at the beep.</i>

21:34.527 --> 21:36.329
Okay, Maya, can you please

21:36.363 --> 21:38.164
let me know
you've survived the tornado

21:38.197 --> 21:40.600
and-- and call
your possibly pregnant wife?

21:40.633 --> 21:42.168
Please? Thank you.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.105
Hey, you're doing
the right thing.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.940
Staying safe
for your family.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.141
Thanks.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.344
Station 19.

21:51.378 --> 21:53.380
Hello, sir.
Hi, there. Uh, can you help?

21:53.413 --> 21:54.881
Uh, that's what we're here for.
What's up?

21:54.914 --> 21:56.115
Glass fell out of the sky. Ouch.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.950
Ooh.
That's what I said.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.652
Please hold.
Yes, I'll take this.

21:59.686 --> 22:01.421
Yeah, right this way, sir.
Follow me.

22:05.492 --> 22:08.127
At least he was
an organ donor.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.829
Yeah.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.698
You seen a tornado before?

22:11.731 --> 22:14.333
In Seattle? Never.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.235
You've seen one before
somewhere else?

22:16.268 --> 22:18.204
Yeah, when I was down South
for basic training,

22:18.237 --> 22:19.739
I saw a bad one.

22:19.772 --> 22:22.675
Almost destroyed a town.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.211
That where you met Chief Ross?
Bishop, what are you doing?

22:25.244 --> 22:26.579
Just making conversation.

22:26.613 --> 22:29.516
Oh, okay.

22:29.549 --> 22:32.251
Look, I know you're still mad
at me, but it's been six months,

22:32.284 --> 22:34.387
and you would have done
the same thing.

22:34.421 --> 22:36.923
And we're on the same team--
Anti-Beckett.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.425
I'm not Anti-Beckett.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.427
You reported him
for drinking on the job.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.228
Because I believed
he was drinking on the job.

22:42.261 --> 22:44.063
Yeah, just like I believed

22:44.096 --> 22:45.532
that you and Chief Ross
were sleeping together.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.935
Even if we were,
it's not the same thing, okay?

22:48.968 --> 22:52.171
Beckett was running the team
into the ground.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.741
Thank God I reported him,
because now he's dry.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.609
Yeah, which makes him
even more of a douche.

22:56.643 --> 22:58.445
Well, because he's doing it
without a program.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.847
He's white-knuckling.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.782
It's like giving up
your painkillers

23:02.815 --> 23:05.952
without doing anything about the
disease that's causing the pain.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.287
Look at you.
So much wisdom,

23:08.320 --> 23:10.289
so much empathy for Beckett
and not an ounce for me.

23:10.322 --> 23:12.091
Why is that?
Aww! Mm!

23:12.124 --> 23:14.360
Why am I still being punished
for my ambition

23:14.393 --> 23:16.729
by you, by Ross,
by Beckett?

23:16.763 --> 23:18.765
Blackmailing the chief
of the Fire Department

23:18.798 --> 23:21.300
is not ambition, okay?
It's a crime.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.102
Now, reporting a suspicion

23:23.135 --> 23:25.605
that you consider to be
out of bounds, that's valid.

23:25.638 --> 23:28.240
But threatening to report
that suspicion

23:28.274 --> 23:30.610
in exchange for a promotion?

23:30.643 --> 23:33.613
Come on. You're lucky
you still have a job at all.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.114
Yeah, I--

23:37.517 --> 23:39.051
It was an impulse.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.319
Yep, an impulse
that didn't go your way,

23:40.352 --> 23:42.755
and now you have
to live with it.

23:42.789 --> 23:46.425
<i>Engine 19 and Aid Car
19 requested to Elmhurst Drive.</i>

23:46.459 --> 23:47.760
Copy, Dispatch.

23:47.794 --> 23:50.129
Engine 19 en route.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.932
<i>Spin cycle today, 19. Let's go.</i>

23:52.965 --> 23:55.635
You did this to yourself,
Bishop, okay?

23:55.668 --> 23:57.937
You burned
your own bridges.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.306
And nobody's punishing you
but you.

24:08.548 --> 24:09.649
Okay, thanks. So, apparently,
Hallie landed in one piece

24:12.218 --> 24:14.921
not too far away.
She's stable.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.423
That's unbelievable.
Hell of a day
she's having, though.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.358
We know if anyone's inside?

24:19.391 --> 24:21.994
Yeah, neighbor says a woman
and her boyfriend live here.

24:22.028 --> 24:23.162
God, why do I know
this house?

24:23.195 --> 24:24.497
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

24:24.531 --> 24:26.265
Ooh. Ouch.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.001
He's inside!
He's-- He's in the bedroom.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.102
- Eva?
- Oh, my God.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.704
- Eva.
- He's-- He's inside.

24:31.738 --> 24:33.439
Oh, damn,
this is Vasquez's house.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.007
Widow of a fallen brother.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.843
Rigo Vasquez, I remember.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.377
You have to get him out.
Eva, Eva, slow down.

24:38.410 --> 24:41.447
Who's inside?
Jack. Ja-Jack's in there.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.815
Jack?
Jack--

24:42.849 --> 24:45.217
Gibson?
No. No, no, no, no.

24:45.251 --> 24:47.386
He--
He's in Kansas City.

24:47.419 --> 24:49.288
Uh, no, he's not.
He's been in my bed

24:49.321 --> 24:51.390
the last three months.

24:55.361 --> 24:56.629
Jack!

25:00.733 --> 25:02.635
[ Muffled ] Jack!
Are you inside?!

25:07.674 --> 25:09.876
Oh, hell.

25:09.909 --> 25:11.844
Jack? Are you in there?

25:11.878 --> 25:13.212
Aw, damn it.

25:18.718 --> 25:21.320
Are you kidding me?

25:21.353 --> 25:22.989
Oh, my God.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.327
I'm out on my afternoon walk

25:28.360 --> 25:30.362
when all this trash
just rains down out of the sky.

25:30.396 --> 25:32.665
I'm so busy cleaning the dust
out of my eyes,

25:32.699 --> 25:36.268
it takes four blocks for me
to realize that my arm hurts.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.605
I look down and see this.
Guess a tornado touched down

25:38.638 --> 25:41.007
just north of Holmsby.
And that's what we call

25:41.040 --> 25:44.110
a man-made climate catastrophe.
That's why my wife says

25:44.143 --> 25:47.013
I should take my mobile with me
when I go walking.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.381
But that's the opposite
of why I go for walks.

25:49.415 --> 25:51.250
I'm with you on that.

25:51.283 --> 25:54.220
Uh, I'm gonna grab
a few supplies.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.088
Just a second.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.890
Uh, and by
"grab a few supplies,"

25:57.924 --> 25:59.692
you mean that you're gonna
call an aid car

25:59.726 --> 26:01.293
to get him
to Grey-Sloan, right?

26:01.327 --> 26:03.429
It's only four
or five stitches, Ben.

26:03.462 --> 26:06.032
You don't want
to waste gas on that.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.734
Look, we've already
destroyed the planet.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.301
There is wind tunnels

26:09.335 --> 26:10.770
where there should not
be wind tunnels.

26:10.803 --> 26:13.105
There is trash
falling from the sky.

26:13.139 --> 26:15.474
If we want to save
what's left,

26:15.507 --> 26:17.576
if we want it at all
to be habitable

26:17.610 --> 26:19.378
for the little baby
that might be growing in me,

26:19.411 --> 26:20.947
we all need
to do our part.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.782
Okay, except that
this is not a hospital.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.383
This is a firehouse.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.753
And today's not a clinic day.
You don't work here!

26:26.786 --> 26:29.588
Look, I-I told you,
I am trying to be good,

26:29.622 --> 26:31.958
color inside the lines,
you know, follow the rules.

26:31.991 --> 26:36.495
Okay, but I did not make
such a promise, so...

26:36.528 --> 26:39.098
Listen, Beckett has been
on everyone's asses

26:39.131 --> 26:40.332
enough as it is
around here.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.301
I'm not afraid
of angry men.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.737
I was raised by one.
Carina, Carina, Carina,

26:44.771 --> 26:47.339
this isn't about
just an angry man.

26:47.373 --> 26:50.242
This is medical licenses
and liability.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.410
A tornado
just touched down.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.945
The phones are ringing
off the hook.

26:52.979 --> 26:54.781
There are aid cars
scattered all over the city.

26:54.814 --> 26:57.083
He needs our help now.

26:57.116 --> 27:00.086
Okay, Stu, let's get
that glass out of there.

27:04.356 --> 27:06.292
I mean, we could get the ladder,
lift it off.

27:06.325 --> 27:08.294
That would require
cutting a bigger hole.

27:08.327 --> 27:10.296
If we wanted your opinion,
we'd ask for it.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.598
Oh, wait.
You'd probably lie to us anyway.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.967
Of all the engine companies,
why did it have to be 19?

27:15.001 --> 27:16.969
Well, you're the genius
who chose to hide out

27:17.003 --> 27:19.105
four blocks from our station.
I'm not hiding out.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.439
The longer this tree
sits on his arm,

27:20.472 --> 27:23.642
the longer his blood flow
is decreased.

27:23.676 --> 27:25.544
Nice beard, Gibson.

27:25.577 --> 27:28.647
So, are we, uh,
lifting or cutting?

27:28.681 --> 27:30.516
No, cutting's gonna take
too long. This is massive.

27:30.549 --> 27:32.384
The four of us could lift it
quicker. We need medical ready.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.553
Look, I-I can feel
my fingers just fine.

27:34.586 --> 27:35.988
We need medical on standby.
Pain's not too bad.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.556
I don't think I have
compartment syndrome.

27:37.589 --> 27:39.726
Just cut the damn tree
and spare the roof.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.160
I just said cutting
could take too long.

27:41.193 --> 27:42.394
Plus, it would
jostle your arm,

27:42.428 --> 27:43.963
which could do more damage
to the tissue.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.998
My arm is fine.
Your arm is crushed.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.466
If it wasn't crushed,
chances are

27:47.499 --> 27:49.301
you could pull it out
from under the damn tree.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.237
Would you just-- just shut up
so we can do our job?

27:51.270 --> 27:53.706
I can't pull it
out 'cause it's handcuffed.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.141
Be-- Because what?

27:55.174 --> 27:57.209
- What was that?
- What'd he say?

27:57.243 --> 27:58.745
Handcuffed.
I said it's handcuffed, alright?

27:58.778 --> 28:00.246
I can't get my arm out
from under there

28:00.279 --> 28:01.914
because it's handcuffed
to the bed.

28:03.449 --> 28:06.018
So let's just cut
the damn tree, okay?

28:13.159 --> 28:14.126
Alright, your vitals look good.
Ruiz, I told you,

28:16.062 --> 28:17.263
I was in the kitchen
when it happened.

28:17.296 --> 28:18.865
It's just protocol.
I have to clear you.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.399
<i>Captain, we need Eva Vasquez</i>

28:20.432 --> 28:22.101
<i>to give us the keys
to the handcuffs.</i>

28:22.134 --> 28:23.702
What?
Keys to what?

28:23.736 --> 28:26.538
Oh, crap.
Forgot he was still cuffed.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.647
Oh, Gibson.

28:36.548 --> 28:40.719
Oh, wow. Okay, this is deeper
than I thought.

28:40.753 --> 28:43.355
Never felt much
in that arm since 'Nam.

28:43.389 --> 28:46.625
You were a soldier?
15 years, till the shrapnel.

28:46.658 --> 28:49.328
Funny coincidence
I'd take some again, same arm.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.899
Oh, my God. Oh.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.233
Oh, geez,
that doesn't look good.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.068
Uh, um--
What happened?

28:56.102 --> 28:59.806
Uh, the-- the-- the wound
was deeper than I thought.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.908
Here, well, just put pressure.
I know.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.475
Here.
We don't keep blood here.

29:03.509 --> 29:04.643
I know.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.583
Okay, uh, I'm gonna release
pressure, inject lidocaine.

29:11.617 --> 29:13.786
Yep. And then I will
put in a stitch

29:13.820 --> 29:16.422
that will stop
the bleeding vessel.

29:16.455 --> 29:17.957
Guess I really should have
gone to the hospital, huh?

29:17.990 --> 29:20.726
No. No. No. You're okay.
We got you.

29:20.759 --> 29:21.994
Are you a doctor?

29:22.028 --> 29:25.131
Yes.
Yes. We both are.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.833
I'm feeling woozy.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.400
Well, just hang on.
Hang on.

29:28.434 --> 29:29.768
Done in just a second.

29:29.802 --> 29:31.303
We're gonna get you
closed up.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.806
Okay. Okay.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.408
Hell of a day
to leave my phone at home.

29:38.811 --> 29:43.015
Oh, God.

29:43.049 --> 29:47.786
Look, Gibson, I don't know
what has happened to you

29:47.820 --> 29:50.589
in the past six months or why
you've been lying to me--

29:50.622 --> 29:52.091
to all of us.

29:52.124 --> 29:55.194
But what I do know is,

29:55.227 --> 29:57.129
you still have a family
here who loves you.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.800
Jack?

30:01.834 --> 30:04.837
It's just-- It's just,
you think you can't go lower.

30:04.871 --> 30:08.640
Then there's always lower,
you know?

30:08.674 --> 30:12.644
You learn that your family, uh,
basically threw you away

30:12.678 --> 30:16.382
and raised your siblings, and--
and so you quit your job

30:16.415 --> 30:17.816
because nothing feels real, right?

30:17.850 --> 30:21.520
Nothing feels like
it matters.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.890
So you start sleeping--
again--

30:23.923 --> 30:26.358
with the wife of the man
you basically killed,

30:26.392 --> 30:29.361
'cause, you know,
misery loves company.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.330
And then, you know,
she brings home handcuffs,

30:31.363 --> 30:34.366
and you think,
"Hey, that sounds like fun."

30:34.400 --> 30:37.970
And then somehow, you end up
pinned under a tree

30:38.004 --> 30:39.571
with all the people you've been
trying to avoid

30:39.605 --> 30:41.173
standing around you,
judging you.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.809
Jack, Jack,
we're not judging you.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.811
You can't go lower.
We-- We love you.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.715
Alright, everyone in position?
Here we go.

30:49.748 --> 30:50.883
Straight through.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.584
And up.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.191
Slow down, slow down.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.196
Hey.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.664
Here.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.266
I got you. Sorry.

31:07.299 --> 31:08.667
Let us clean that up
for you, Jack.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.836
Please don't.
I'm a grown man.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.005
I can walk myself
to the doctor.

31:13.039 --> 31:16.242
Thank you
for your time, though.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.544
What about
the rest of the tree?

31:18.577 --> 31:20.712
I think you should probably
call a handyman for that.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.788
You should, uh,
take him to the hospital.

31:29.821 --> 31:31.958
His wrist is not okay.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.361
Jack--

31:35.394 --> 31:38.264
Yeah, I don't have
any more sperm for you, Bishop.

31:38.297 --> 31:41.267
You know, the sperm bank's,
uh, run dry, so...

31:41.300 --> 31:43.235
Wow.

31:43.269 --> 31:45.371
Okay.
Good luck with all this.

31:49.808 --> 31:52.211
Okay, you know, Jack,

31:52.244 --> 31:55.147
it is not gonna
feel this way forever,

31:55.181 --> 31:57.283
unless you let it kill you.

31:59.651 --> 32:01.620
Don't.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.498
Did we not
save the guy's life?

32:12.531 --> 32:14.333
No, you-- Oh, my God.
That is not the point.

32:14.366 --> 32:15.901
What-- Then what is the point?
That is not the point!

32:15.934 --> 32:17.769
You're overreacting. Why--
I'm overreacting?

32:17.803 --> 32:19.671
Yes, you're overreacting.
Car fell out of the sky today.

32:19.705 --> 32:22.308
Did you hear?
Okay, I'm sorry, okay?

32:22.341 --> 32:24.410
You were right, and I was wrong.
No, he could have bled out.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.478
You would have lost
your medical license.

32:26.512 --> 32:28.247
And-- Oh, my God.
I sound like my wife.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.948
Uh-huh.
Is this how you all feel

32:29.982 --> 32:32.284
when I break the rules
and you warned me not to?

32:32.318 --> 32:33.919
How do you feel?
You know those dreams

32:33.952 --> 32:35.121
where you're driving the car
but the brakes don't work?

32:35.154 --> 32:36.755
Yep, that's
how we always feel.

32:36.788 --> 32:37.823
What did she do?

32:37.856 --> 32:40.626
Ohh. Performed surgery.

32:40.659 --> 32:43.795
In the barn.

32:43.829 --> 32:47.533
God, this is a horrible feeling.
I-I owe so many apologies.

32:47.566 --> 32:51.003
Well, I'm glad you could
learn something today, Ben.

32:51.037 --> 32:52.671
You-- Those hormones
make you so much meaner

32:52.704 --> 32:54.206
than you usually are.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.176
I-I know!
I know. Don't you think I know?

32:57.209 --> 32:59.545
And it's not--
it's not just the hormones.

32:59.578 --> 33:02.314
I'm 38, which,
in the fertility world,

33:02.348 --> 33:05.117
is considered "geriatric."
And this is my fifth try.

33:05.151 --> 33:08.020
And I've always wanted
to give birth.

33:08.054 --> 33:10.489
Not just have a baby,
give birth.

33:10.522 --> 33:13.192
And I might not get to,

33:13.225 --> 33:14.826
and this makes me
a little meaner, too.

33:14.860 --> 33:17.663
And, please,
somebody change the subject.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.501
Did you say a car
fell out of the sky?
It was bananas.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.803
Have you heard from my wife?
Uh, yeah. She-- She's fine.

33:24.836 --> 33:28.574
They're on their way back.
Uh, apparently, they found Jack.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.042
What do you mean
they found him?

33:30.076 --> 33:31.977
Something about handcuffs
and a tree.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.213
Whatever.
Jack is dead to me.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.819
She's so much meaner.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.921
I-I feel for her, but...

33:42.954 --> 33:45.191
yeah. So much.

33:48.427 --> 33:52.531
Bishop, you're
on engine cleanup.

33:52.564 --> 33:53.999
I was on that last week.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.568
Well, grunt work suits you.

33:56.602 --> 33:58.970
And make sure you get that
little pile of mints over there.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.641
Yes, sir.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.348
You-- You have no right
to be a dick to Maya.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.250
What is it?
You're such a small man

34:11.283 --> 34:13.051
that you feel
threatened by her,

34:13.085 --> 34:15.687
because she's a woman
who had your job before you?

34:15.721 --> 34:17.589
What is it?
Okay. You know,

34:17.623 --> 34:20.726
I'm actually, uh--
I'm into women with power.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.728
Oh, God. Oh, God. Disgusting.
It's my thing.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.696
Yeah, what I'm not into
is my employees

34:24.730 --> 34:28.300
committing crimes, blackmailing
my chief into firing me,

34:28.334 --> 34:32.438
or just, you know,
general insubordination.

34:32.471 --> 34:34.206
It's basic physics, Italy.

34:34.240 --> 34:36.242
You push me, I push you.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.444
Your wife blackmailed the chief,
had no proof of anything,

34:38.477 --> 34:40.546
and that brings us to today.

34:47.553 --> 34:48.254
Okay, that's not
what I'm saying.

34:50.589 --> 34:51.923
You are not listening to me.
You blackmailed your boss, Maya.

34:51.957 --> 34:53.425
Okay, I just need you
to be on my side.

34:53.459 --> 34:54.960
God, everyone is against me.
For the last six months,

34:54.993 --> 34:56.495
I've been eating crap
from everybody.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.664
Please just be on my side.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.899
For the last six months, you've
been keeping this from me.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.434
For the last six months,

35:02.468 --> 35:04.636
you come home miserable,
and I don't know why.

35:04.670 --> 35:07.573
And when I ask, you deny
that anything is wrong with you,

35:07.606 --> 35:09.141
and it's been
making me crazy.

35:09.175 --> 35:10.576
And now the truth is out,

35:10.609 --> 35:12.778
and you are not even
the one who told me.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.280
And you need me
to be on your side?

35:14.313 --> 35:15.747
You need me to be
on your side?

35:15.781 --> 35:17.749
This is emotional
blackmail, Maya,

35:17.783 --> 35:19.985
which is not entirely dissimilar
to what you did to Chief Ross.

35:20.018 --> 35:21.587
Hey, you know, I was trying
to get my job back, okay?

35:21.620 --> 35:24.490
For us, for our family.

35:24.523 --> 35:27.159
Do not give me that crap.
This was for you, and--

35:27.193 --> 35:29.461
You know what? Fine.
So what if it was?

35:29.495 --> 35:31.697
Okay? I want my job back.
Is that a crime?

35:31.730 --> 35:33.365
No.
But blackmail is a crime.

35:33.399 --> 35:35.000
And it's not even
about your job.

35:35.033 --> 35:36.935
It's-- It's about the chaos.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.970
You're constantly
in the middle of chaos.

35:39.004 --> 35:41.973
It's-- I don't think you know
how to live a normal life.

35:42.007 --> 35:43.809
It's constantly up and down
and up and down,

35:43.842 --> 35:44.810
and it reminds me
of my childhood,

35:44.843 --> 35:46.612
and it's crazy-making.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.615
Do you know how impossible
you are these days?

35:49.648 --> 35:51.817
And it's the hormones,
and I get it, and I am patient,

35:51.850 --> 35:53.385
but now I'm the one
that's acting crazy?

35:53.419 --> 35:55.187
That's really pot-kettle,
Carina.

35:58.390 --> 36:01.227
Yes. The hormones
make me emotional.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.462
And, yes, when I am angry,
I feel angrier.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.997
When I'm sad, I feel sadder.
But what you did,

36:06.031 --> 36:09.468
there is no hormones
to blame, my love.

36:09.501 --> 36:13.739
We were happy,
and you created chaos.

36:13.772 --> 36:17.543
We-- We were making a baby.
I had just gotten my green card.

36:17.576 --> 36:21.713
We had happiness,
and you needed to wreck it.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.315
You need to look into that.

36:23.349 --> 36:24.816
You need to do something.
I need to what?

36:24.850 --> 36:28.354
To fix it. You-- I can't--
I can't live like that.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.889
I can't make a baby
with that. I--

36:30.922 --> 36:32.190
Oh, w-with "that"?

36:32.224 --> 36:34.393
Yes, with you, like that.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.328
If we're going
to have a baby together,

36:36.362 --> 36:38.196
you need to get help.

37:13.399 --> 37:14.733
You alright?
Sort of.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.968
We survived a twister,

37:17.002 --> 37:19.538
so I'm trying
to be grateful,

37:19.571 --> 37:22.941
but, honestly,

37:22.974 --> 37:24.276
I'm scared as hell for Jack.

37:24.310 --> 37:26.478
Yeah, he's, uh--
he's in a bad way.

37:29.348 --> 37:32.751
But you know you can't
fix him, Andy, right?

37:32.784 --> 37:34.920
All you can do is, uh--

37:34.953 --> 37:37.489
You just have to be there

37:37.523 --> 37:40.091
if he, uh--
if he asks for help.

37:40.125 --> 37:41.760
You believe in signs?

37:41.793 --> 37:43.629
What do you mean?

37:43.662 --> 37:46.332
I mean a woman and her car
were lifted into the sky today,

37:46.365 --> 37:51.437
and somehow, miraculously,
she landed wheels-down

37:51.470 --> 37:53.171
right by the party
where Travis was,

37:53.204 --> 37:54.973
and he was able
to save her.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.275
Uh-huh.
She lived.

37:57.309 --> 37:59.645
My dad would say
that's a sign.

37:59.678 --> 38:01.947
Because, you know, he believed
in guardian angels.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.415
He didn't believe
in coincidence.

38:03.449 --> 38:06.418
He would say coincidence
was divine intervention.

38:06.452 --> 38:08.086
Mm.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.323
So you think
he sent you a sign?
