00:02.919 --> 00:04.336
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:04.504 --> 00:06.964
I saw the Porsche parked out front.

00:07.132 --> 00:10.509
Can I get the keys?
I'll take that bad boy for a spin.

00:10.677 --> 00:15.723
Ross drives it? When I ask,
you say you're the only one allowed to.

00:15.890 --> 00:19.393
He's my brother, plus he drives
so slow he couldn't hurt it.

00:19.561 --> 00:22.229
It's a car, Monica, not a rocket ship.

00:22.772 --> 00:23.814
Whatever, Ross.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.942
Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights
after you're done.

00:28.778 --> 00:30.195
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:30.363 --> 00:34.825
Saw the Porsche. Looking good.
When can I take it out again?

00:38.121 --> 00:42.541
- You let Joey drive it?
- I've never driven it. Not once.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.794
Okay, once. Okay, I drive it all the time.

00:48.173 --> 00:52.301
So much for the "you can drive it
but don't tell Rachel" plan.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.512
Wow, I can't believe you lied to me.

00:55.680 --> 01:00.642
I can fix this. Monica, Rachel thinks
all you can talk about is the wedding.

01:02.937 --> 01:07.483
I won't let you drive the Porsche
because you're a terrible driver.

01:07.692 --> 01:10.319
There. That wasn't about the wedding.

01:12.072 --> 01:16.825
If you want a ride in the Porsche,
I'll take you around the block.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.494
You got a couple hours?

01:58.993 --> 02:00.702
Whew, that was a brisk ride.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.791
- Take the top down, did you?
- Only way to fly.

02:07.502 --> 02:12.214
Give me the keys. Monica's wrong.
I'm an excellent driver.

02:12.382 --> 02:16.468
You're fast and irresponsible.
That adds up to a bad driver.

02:16.636 --> 02:20.222
In high school, that added up
to head cheerleader.

02:24.352 --> 02:27.813
Did you see the look
that girl just gave me, huh?

02:28.148 --> 02:30.774
She must've seen me cruising
in the bad boy.

02:30.942 --> 02:34.153
- She's checking out your beehive.
- What?

02:35.238 --> 02:37.406
- Give me a brush.
- Give me the keys.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.158
- No way!
- Well, no brush.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.201
Fine. It doesn't matter.

02:41.369 --> 02:45.455
If I remember correctly, there's a comb
on the floor of the bathroom.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.473
Alimony.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.981
We still haven't gotten an RSVP
from your dad.

03:11.232 --> 03:15.777
Oh, right. Um, maybe that's because
I didn't send him an invitation.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.032
Chandler, he's your father.
He should be at your wedding.

03:20.200 --> 03:24.203
I don't even know him.
I haven't seen him in years.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.914
And when he finds out he wasn't asked?

03:27.081 --> 03:29.374
We don't run in the same circles.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.669
I hang out with you guys and he...

03:32.837 --> 03:35.547
...stars in a drag show in Vegas.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.342
Ooh, I think I want to trade circles.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.179
You don't want him there.
Nobody will stare at the bride...

03:42.430 --> 03:45.724
...when the groom's father's
wearing a backless dress.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.059
Heh, so what?

03:47.227 --> 03:50.646
As long as he's not wearing
a white dress and a veil, I don't care.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.273
I think I need to do some shopping.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.905
Ah.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.866
Ooh, nice.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.536
My God!

04:07.872 --> 04:11.959
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just washing the windshield.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.841
There's no way I'll let you drive this car.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.844
- Just hand over the keys.
- Oh.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.096
Oh, ah-ah-ah!

04:24.264 --> 04:26.640
Do not start this car.

04:29.894 --> 04:32.688
Okay, okay. I will give you 20 bucks...

04:32.855 --> 04:36.358
...if you get out of this car right now. Hey!

04:38.361 --> 04:39.653
Look.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.406
If you're so freaked out, get in the car.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.283
With you? Yeah, right.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.701
All right.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.953
Okay, okay, okay.

04:51.791 --> 04:55.669
- What are you doing? Get in front.
- In the death seat?

05:02.343 --> 05:04.136
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, sweetie.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.639
- Ready to go?
- My purse is at Mon's. I'll be back.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.099
- Wait a minute.
- What?

05:09.267 --> 05:10.726
Oh.

05:11.853 --> 05:12.894
Ooh!

05:14.689 --> 05:15.814
Oops.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.108
Whoa, oh, that one kept going.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.073
So, you and Phoebe, huh?

05:25.241 --> 05:27.242
- How long have you been going out?
- A month.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.829
Wow. We ought to get to
know each other better.

05:30.997 --> 05:34.583
- Sure. I'd like that.
- Yeah. So, uh...

05:35.335 --> 05:37.210
What's your name?

05:39.589 --> 05:41.840
- It's Jake.
- Joey.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.551
- Do you like the Knicks?
- Yeah, big fan.

05:44.719 --> 05:48.388
Me too. There's a game Tuesday.
Do you want to go?

05:48.556 --> 05:52.309
Great! Let me make sure
I'm not doing anything Tuesday.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.027
Here.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.739
- What's this?
- Your suitcase. We're going to Vegas.

06:05.907 --> 06:08.992
Are you serious? Eloping?
No more stupid wedding stuff.

06:09.160 --> 06:13.580
No more these flowers, these flowers.
Think of the money we'll save.

06:13.790 --> 06:17.626
We're not eloping. I love the flowers.
Can our wedding be bigger, please?

06:18.711 --> 06:20.587
We're going to see your dad.

06:20.755 --> 06:23.298
I want to get to know my father-in-law.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.509
We already went over this and I won.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.637
No, you didn't. Honey, just so you know...

06:28.805 --> 06:31.640
Now that you're marrying me,
you don't get to win anymore.

06:33.184 --> 06:36.978
Forget it. I don't want to go.
I don't want to see him.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.856
I know your dad embarrassed you.

06:40.024 --> 06:42.567
All kids are embarrassed
by their parents.

06:42.735 --> 06:46.071
You need a new word
for what I went through.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.199
In high school,
he came to all my swim meets...

06:49.367 --> 06:52.577
...dressed as a Hollywood starlet.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.121
It's hard enough to be 14.

06:54.288 --> 06:58.417
You're skinny, wearing Speedos
your mom promised you'd grow into.

07:01.087 --> 07:04.047
You look up in the stands.
There's your dad cheering you on.

07:04.215 --> 07:08.135
Dressed as Carmen Miranda,
wearing a headdress with real fruit...

07:08.302 --> 07:12.848
...that he'll later give to your friends
as a healthy snack.

07:13.850 --> 07:18.270
The point is that he was at every one
of your swim meets cheering you on.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.397
That's a pretty great dad.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.524
He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi.

07:22.692 --> 07:25.986
- Who's Mr. Garibaldi?
- Does it matter?

07:27.738 --> 07:29.072
Chandler...

07:29.240 --> 07:34.077
You're not 14 anymore, okay?
Maybe it's time you let that stuff go.

07:35.163 --> 07:40.542
If he's not at your wedding,
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

07:42.837 --> 07:45.714
Okay, but I'm just doing this for you.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.299
Yes!

07:48.259 --> 07:52.262
- I never get to win anymore?
- How much did you ever win before?

07:56.309 --> 07:57.976
- Pheebs.
- Hey.

07:58.144 --> 08:01.938
You know how, uh, when you're wearing pants
and you lean forward...

08:02.106 --> 08:03.565
...I check out your underwear?

08:03.733 --> 08:05.233
Yeah.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.111
- Well, when Jake did it...
- Mm-hm.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.823
...I saw that he was wearing
women's underwear.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.742
I know. They were mine.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.660
Oh.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.664
No, no, wait. That's weird.

08:20.249 --> 08:23.668
We were goofing around,
and I dared him to try them on.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.253
That's weird!

08:25.421 --> 08:29.257
- I'm wearing his briefs right now.
- That's kind of hot.

08:29.967 --> 08:35.472
I think so too. And that little flap?
Great for holding my lipstick.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.395
I wouldn't know about that.

08:43.856 --> 08:48.109
Jake says that women's underwear
is actually more comfortable.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.279
He loves how silk feels against his skin.

08:51.447 --> 08:55.700
Next he'll say your high heels
are good for his posture.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.412
There's nothing wrong with Jake.
He is all man.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.331
I think, more than you.

09:01.499 --> 09:05.377
He looked like a real lumberjack
in those pink lacies.

09:06.462 --> 09:10.674
Only a man completely secure
with his masculinity...

09:10.841 --> 09:14.135
...could walk around in women's underwear.
I don't think you could.

09:14.303 --> 09:18.348
- I am secure with my masculinity.
- Okay, whatever.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.101
You've seen my huge stack of porn.

09:27.441 --> 09:30.235
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?

09:32.530 --> 09:35.490
God, I forgot how much I love driving.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.368
I have got to get my license renewed.

09:41.414 --> 09:45.375
You don't have a valid driver's license?
Pull over right now.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.628
You're so tense. You just gotta relax, okay?

09:48.796 --> 09:53.925
Okay? Just need to relax. All right?
Just need to relax.

09:54.093 --> 09:57.971
What are you...? That's not funny.
Stop horsing around.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.390
I am not horsing around, okay?

10:00.558 --> 10:03.852
I am "Porsche-ing" around.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.775
Uh-oh.

10:10.943 --> 10:16.072
Stay calm. Nothing will happen.
You're not in that much trouble.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.657
Really? You think so?

10:17.825 --> 10:20.619
I'm talking to myself. You're going down!

11:00.618 --> 11:04.245
I can feel something inside me say

11:04.413 --> 11:06.164
Has someone taken your order?

11:06.332 --> 11:11.878
Oh, yeah. She did. Um, he did. She?
I'm sorry, I'm new. I don't...

11:12.922 --> 11:13.963
Mm-hm.

11:14.131 --> 11:17.342
- I just ordered a beer.
- You're straight. I get it.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.389
If we called your dad,
we'd have better seats.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.434
I don't want him to know
we're here yet. I'm not ready.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.437
He won't be too happy to see me either.

11:29.605 --> 11:30.980
Why not?

11:31.857 --> 11:35.610
I don't know if I told you this,
but he's kind of tried to contact me...

11:35.778 --> 11:38.822
...a lot over the last few years.
- What?

11:38.989 --> 11:42.117
Yeah. He's made phone calls,
written letters.

11:42.284 --> 11:45.912
He even came to New York.
I said I was too busy.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.748
It's very "Cat's in the Cradle."
I don't want to get into it.

11:52.336 --> 11:53.628
Here we go.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.714
Ladies and gentlemen...

11:55.881 --> 12:00.218
...please welcome the incomparable
Helena Handbasket.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.724
Hello, darlings.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.184
And there's Daddy.

12:14.066 --> 12:18.319
Okay. Switch places with me. Come on!
I'll go under, you go over.

12:18.487 --> 12:21.322
- Yeah, I'll get right on that.
- Ugh, come on!

12:21.490 --> 12:23.074
What? No. Hey, Rach, come on.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.870
I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.290
God!

12:33.627 --> 12:37.464
Hi, officer. Was I going a little too fast?

12:37.673 --> 12:39.257
Oh, my God.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.136
- Can I see your license, please?
- Oh, yes, absolutely.

12:43.345 --> 12:47.849
It's weird. I had a dream last night
that I was stopped by a policeman.

12:49.226 --> 12:50.268
And then he, um...

12:50.519 --> 12:54.147
Well, I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.

12:55.024 --> 12:59.778
- Your license.
- Yes. Ahem. Here you go, Officer, uh...

12:59.987 --> 13:01.446
...Handsome.

13:02.239 --> 13:05.408
- It's Hanson.
- Oops, sorry. My mistake.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.577
Dear Lord!

13:09.079 --> 13:11.039
- Wow!
- Here it comes.

13:11.540 --> 13:12.874
This is a great picture.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.375
Ah!

13:14.543 --> 13:18.087
Really? You think so?
You know, I had just rolled right out of bed.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.923
You look phenomenal.

13:20.090 --> 13:23.009
She should! It was taken 10 years ago!

13:26.347 --> 13:28.473
You know, you're probably, um...

13:28.682 --> 13:30.642
Probably wondering about the old date.

13:30.893 --> 13:34.020
Yes, I am. You're an Aquarius, huh?

13:35.773 --> 13:38.066
- I'll bet you're a Gemini.
- No.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.567
- Taurus?
- No.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.569
- Virgo?
- No.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.780
- Sagittarius?
- Yep.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.407
I knew it. I knew it!

13:46.575 --> 13:49.577
- You won't speed anymore, right?
- I won't speed.

13:49.745 --> 13:52.539
- Promise to take care of this?
- I promise.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.666
Let him drive. Does he have a license?

13:54.834 --> 13:57.252
- Yeah.
- Can he handle a stick?

13:57.419 --> 14:00.922
- Oh, well...
- I can handle a stick!

14:04.969 --> 14:06.469
I feel pretty

14:06.637 --> 14:08.304
Oh, so pretty

14:08.472 --> 14:11.015
I feel pretty and witty and

14:11.183 --> 14:12.517
Gay

14:15.729 --> 14:20.233
- That can't be your father.
- I've been saying that for years.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.527
- Oh, my God!
- What?

14:22.695 --> 14:25.238
That's Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.117
For I'm loved

14:29.285 --> 14:34.247
By a pretty wonderful boy

14:39.253 --> 14:41.963
Hello, and welcome to the show.

14:42.131 --> 14:46.009
I see some of our regulars in the audience.

14:46.260 --> 14:49.512
And a couple of irregulars.

14:51.223 --> 14:55.268
- He's coming into the audience.
- Relax. You'll be fine.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.022
Oh, much better. You're invisible now.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.483
- Where are you from?
- Bakersfield.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.694
- I'm sorry?
- Bakersfield.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.906
No, no, I heard. I'm just sorry.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.618
I'll meet you back at the hotel.

15:13.162 --> 15:17.373
Look, a standing ovation already.
So early in the show.

15:17.625 --> 15:21.544
Turn around, darling.
Let me see your pretty face.

15:29.720 --> 15:33.932
Can we have our drinks, please?
Uh, waiter? ...tress?

15:45.527 --> 15:47.654
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.449
Check it out.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.826
Huh?

15:56.914 --> 15:58.998
How much of a man am I?

15:59.208 --> 16:03.836
Wow, nice. Manly, and also kind of a slut.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.174
You know, I'm beginning to see
what Jake was talking about.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.843
- Uh-huh.
- The silk feels really good.

16:11.595 --> 16:16.474
And things aren't as smashed down
as I thought they would be.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.850
That's great.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.770
You have so many more choices
than with men's underwear.

16:20.938 --> 16:26.359
Bikini, French cut, thong.
And the fabrics: Cotton, silk, lace.

16:26.527 --> 16:30.196
You know what I've always
wondered about? Pantyhose!

16:30.406 --> 16:34.534
The way they start at your toe,
then they go all the way up to...

16:37.705 --> 16:40.957
- I should go take these off.
- I think it's important you do.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.333
Mm.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.461
What's your name?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.507
Chandler.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.051
Chandler?

16:52.219 --> 16:54.512
What an unusual name.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.057
You must have had terribly
fascinating parents.

16:58.225 --> 17:00.184
Oh, they're a hoot.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.063
And who is your friend?

17:04.606 --> 17:07.108
I'm Monica.

17:07.276 --> 17:10.944
- Monica. Where are you from?
- New York.

17:11.655 --> 17:14.031
I'm not very fond of New York.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.784
Queens, I like.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.371
Ooh, what is this...

17:20.539 --> 17:24.291
...sparkling something, honey, huh?

17:25.961 --> 17:28.755
Actually, Monica and I are engaged.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.716
Really?

17:32.259 --> 17:34.135
Congratulations.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.679
When's the big day?

17:38.599 --> 17:40.433
In two weeks.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.061
I see.

17:44.521 --> 17:49.192
Well, I wish you both
a lifetime of happiness.

17:49.985 --> 17:52.320
So you're bald.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.155
Wait, wait.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.285
We'd really love it if you could be there.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.039
Really?

18:04.917 --> 18:07.126
I know it would make me happy...

18:08.337 --> 18:09.837
...ma'am.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.009
Then I wouldn't miss it for the world.

18:16.470 --> 18:19.013
Oh, I'm getting all misty here. Ha!

18:19.389 --> 18:22.225
You'd think I was having my legs waxed
or something.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.690
- You okay?
- Yeah.

18:29.858 --> 18:32.151
Thanks for making me do this.

18:33.112 --> 18:37.240
Before we go on with the show,
I want to say to the bride and groom...

18:37.407 --> 18:40.326
...how lucky they are to have
found each other.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.080
In every life a little rain must fall.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.623
Fortunately...

18:45.791 --> 18:47.792
...in my life...

18:51.421 --> 18:53.422
It's raining men

18:53.632 --> 18:55.258
Hallelujah

18:55.425 --> 18:58.845
- It's raining men, uh-huh
- Amen

19:02.558 --> 19:06.018
When I was growing up,
I played the one on the far left.

19:08.605 --> 19:11.774
And it's raining men, amen

19:17.447 --> 19:19.448
Remind me to introduce you to someone.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.159
- Who?
- Fourth gear.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.038
What?

19:26.206 --> 19:28.457
What does he want?
I wasn't doing anything.

19:28.625 --> 19:33.337
Maybe he saw your hands slip briefly
from the 10 and 2:00 position.

19:35.632 --> 19:40.052
Maybe it's, uh, Sergeant Sagittarius
coming back to flirt some more.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.265
It's a different guy.

19:47.394 --> 19:51.105
- Good evening, officer.
- Do you know how fast you were going?

19:51.315 --> 19:55.109
Uh, no, I don't, but it could not
have been more than 60.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.069
You're right. It was 37.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.286
You're not ticketing me
for driving too slow, are you?

20:05.495 --> 20:07.205
That's right.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.632
You know, officer, I, uh...

20:19.134 --> 20:21.552
I had the weirdest dream last night.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.971
Oh, my God!

20:24.640 --> 20:26.015
Your license, please.

20:27.684 --> 20:31.020
You don't want to hear about my dream...

20:31.230 --> 20:32.772
...Officer...

20:32.940 --> 20:34.357
...Pretty?

20:37.903 --> 20:39.528
It's Petty.

20:41.114 --> 20:43.574
I'll be right back with your ticket.

20:46.161 --> 20:49.205
- You have a son.
- I know. I know.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.422
- Feel better?
- Yeah. Much. Heh.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.258
Listen, uh...

21:00.425 --> 21:05.763
Not that I'm insecure about
my manhood or anything, but, uh...

21:05.931 --> 21:08.683
...I need to hook up with
a woman right now.

21:09.142 --> 21:12.019
- I understand.
- Yeah, okay.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.651
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.404
You look familiar. Do I know you?

21:21.571 --> 21:22.905
I don't think so.

21:23.073 --> 21:25.491
Maybe it's because I'm on television.

21:27.619 --> 21:31.497
- I'm an actor on Days of our Lives.
- Wow. Really?

21:31.707 --> 21:34.500
- Four-fifty, please.
- Oh, let me get this.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.721
These are for you.
