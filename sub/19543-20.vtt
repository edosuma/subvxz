00:02.503 --> 00:06.416
Gohan and the others,
in search of new Dragon Balls,

00:06.507 --> 00:09.169
arrive at last on Planet Namek.

00:10.386 --> 00:15.972
However, at that same moment,
Vegeta also lands on Planet Namek.

00:19.395 --> 00:24.560
An even greater foe was
already lying in wait, as well.

02:07.085 --> 02:10.577
Now there are three of them left.

02:14.885 --> 02:18.252
Hold on to those carefully, Dodoria-san.

02:18.347 --> 02:21.555
It appears that Vegeta is after them, as well.

02:25.646 --> 02:31.107
Freeza-sama, Kewie has just
landed, in pursuit of Vegeta.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.559
Also, the two large power readings

02:33.654 --> 02:35.861
that appeared shortly before Vegeta arrived

02:35.948 --> 02:38.189
suddenly disappeared, and remain so.

02:39.743 --> 02:42.655
Our men are searching the area
where the readings came from,

02:42.746 --> 02:45.738
so we should find out their source momentarily.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.575
Well, the problem is how to deal with Vegeta,

02:48.669 --> 02:51.331
who has turned against me.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.332
In that case, you need not worry.

02:53.423 --> 02:57.541
Kewie is on his way to dispose of Vegeta.

02:57.636 --> 03:00.127
The two of them have always hated each other,

03:00.222 --> 03:02.804
and their abilities are just about evenly matched.

03:02.891 --> 03:06.804
Whatever happens, Vegeta
will not come out unharmed.

03:08.647 --> 03:11.480
Vegeta, you won't get away!

03:15.028 --> 03:18.691
I found you, Vegeta. l have
orders from Freeza-sama.

03:18.782 --> 03:23.526
Do you read me, Vegeta? Now I can
kill you, without any reservations!

03:23.620 --> 03:28.159
Don't make me laugh, Kewie.
Do you really think you can kill me?

03:28.250 --> 03:30.957
Hurry up and get here. I'm waiting for you.

03:32.296 --> 03:35.709
What are you, blind? Take a
good look at your Scouter!

03:35.799 --> 03:39.667
My battle power is clearly higher than yours!

03:44.600 --> 03:47.717
In any event, we can't just stay here, huh?

03:47.811 --> 03:51.019
I'll let you guys take care
of getting the Dragon Balls.

03:54.026 --> 03:58.235
Okay, I'm going back to Earth, so good luck.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.735
Kuririn-san, someone is coming!

04:08.373 --> 04:11.240
The readings vanished right around here.

04:11.335 --> 04:12.825
Probably a Namekian.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.501
Who is it?

04:14.588 --> 04:17.125
It's probably a Namekian.

04:19.718 --> 04:22.209
That's not a Namekian!

04:24.389 --> 04:26.345
W-Who's that?

04:26.433 --> 04:29.891
T-They're not Namekians. Who are they?

04:32.481 --> 04:34.267
It doesn't really matter.

04:34.358 --> 04:39.148
We've got orders to kill everyone on this planet.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.943
Look at their outfits!

04:44.034 --> 04:46.070
They're just like what the Saiyans were wearing.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.152
But they aren't Saiyans!

04:49.873 --> 04:53.240
I don't know what any of this means,
but I've got a bad feeling.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.417
Y-Yeah. Any way you look at it,

04:55.504 --> 04:58.120
those are not the sort of faces
that say "let's be friends."

04:58.215 --> 05:02.254
Gohan, build up your Ki,
but keep your presence masked.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.005
R-Right.

05:07.349 --> 05:11.638
You see that? Their battle
power is pretty much trash.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.014
Are these guys just tourists?

05:14.106 --> 05:15.937
We won't have any fun if they get away from us.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.935
Take out their spaceship first.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.607
All right.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.029
Oh, no! The spaceship!

05:28.120 --> 05:31.954
These guys are unlucky to have
come here at a time like this.

05:32.040 --> 05:37.080
Gohan, release your Ki.
These guys aren't all that tough.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.376
Mm-hmm.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.919
Hey, did you hear that?

05:40.007 --> 05:43.795
Not that tough? Does he mean us?

05:50.267 --> 05:53.509
W-What's with these battle power ratings?!

05:53.603 --> 05:55.730
--Let's get them!
--Right!

06:09.161 --> 06:11.618
Hey, nice, nice!

06:11.705 --> 06:14.117
That was not nice!

06:22.132 --> 06:24.965
What do we do about that?

06:30.307 --> 06:33.424
Is something the matter, Zarbon-san?

06:33.518 --> 06:39.559
Yes, Freeza-sama. It concerns the
scouts that were sent out earlier.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.482
Apparently, these guys are
not your average people.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.151
For a moment, their battle powers rose,

06:45.238 --> 06:47.103
and then, after defeating our two scouts,

06:47.199 --> 06:49.190
their readings disappeared again.

06:49.284 --> 06:54.870
Ho, that is unusual. It doesn't
appear to be Vegeta, either.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.663
No, Vegeta's reading is separate.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.333
Both of these battle powers were around 1,500.

07:00.420 --> 07:05.585
1,500, you say? Nothing would
come of it if we left them alone,

07:05.675 --> 07:08.803
but their attitude seems poor.

07:08.887 --> 07:12.220
The next time they appear, eliminate them.

07:17.687 --> 07:23.808
It's hopeless! It's all over!
I'll never get back to Earth again!

07:23.902 --> 07:27.110
Bulma-san, for now,
let's get away from this place.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.314
There could be trouble.
Someone stronger might be coming.

07:30.408 --> 07:34.492
He's right. Those many Kithat we
sensed are apparently not Namekians,

07:34.579 --> 07:36.695
but friends of Vegeta,

07:36.790 --> 07:40.078
so we have to find someplace to hide.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.908
We'll manage something.

07:42.003 --> 07:46.246
I'm sure the Namekians will fix the spaceship.

07:46.341 --> 07:49.504
How nice that you're so optimistic.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.970
Bulma-san...

07:57.435 --> 07:59.596
Hmph, you're finally here...

07:59.688 --> 08:01.553
...yOU moron.

08:12.284 --> 08:17.654
The time is finally here, when we
can settle the score, as rivals.

08:17.747 --> 08:23.117
However, you've lost your touch.
With that battle power,

08:23.211 --> 08:25.372
you have no chance of beating me.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.920
As rivals, you say?

08:29.467 --> 08:31.924
Well, let me show you something.

08:32.011 --> 08:36.426
When I was on Earth, I picked up
something interesting from them.

08:36.515 --> 08:40.350
What, how to run away quickly?

08:40.437 --> 08:43.929
How to control my battle power.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.857
How to control your battle power?

08:48.778 --> 08:54.114
Take a good look at my battle
power rating on your Scouter!

08:54.201 --> 08:58.945
I-Impossible! Our battle powers
have always been evenly matched!

08:59.039 --> 09:03.157
You imbecile! I have been constantly
engaged in actual combat!

09:03.251 --> 09:06.459
The fight I had on Earth nearly killed me.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.003
Did you think I would remain
evenly matched with you,

09:09.090 --> 09:11.957
with you staying all curled up next to Freeza?!

09:13.553 --> 09:17.091
19,000... 20,000... 21,000... 22,000...!

09:20.852 --> 09:22.433
What happened, Zarbon?

09:22.520 --> 09:25.262
I-I think it was a malfunction,

09:25.357 --> 09:30.351
but the Scouter I had set to Vegeta
had a rating of around 22,000.

09:30.445 --> 09:34.154
22,000? That really must
have been a malfunction.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.402
Your Scouter is an older model, after all.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.360
I'll get the correct reading with mine.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.204
What's the rating?

09:43.291 --> 09:47.330
T-That's impossible! Is my newer
model malfunctioning, too?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.376
It's risen to 24,000!

09:49.464 --> 09:55.585
24,000? Are you saying that his
battle power is higher than ours?

09:55.679 --> 10:01.720
I-It can't be. His battle power
topped out at 18,000.

10:01.810 --> 10:04.517
There is no reason to be surprised.

10:04.604 --> 10:08.347
Vegeta has been fighting
at the forefront, after all.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.933
He must have come across
some trick while he was on Earth.

10:12.028 --> 10:12.813
But sir...

10:12.904 --> 10:17.819
It is only 24,000. At that level,
if you fight him together,

10:21.902 --> 10:26.084
it will be enough to beat him, will it not?

10:26.084 --> 10:32.375
W-Wait, Vegeta! Ijust had an idea!
Let me team up with you!

10:32.465 --> 10:39.633
I-I'II help you! I've never been fond
of Freeza-sama-- I mean, Freeza!

10:39.723 --> 10:44.433
N-Not a bad idea, right? W-With your
battle power, if we teamed up,

10:44.519 --> 10:48.182
I think we could handle Zarbon and Dodoria!

10:48.273 --> 10:50.855
Just keep spouting your worthless lies!

10:50.942 --> 10:53.354
You are one thoroughly sickening bastard!

10:55.572 --> 10:58.735
Believe me, Vegeta!

10:58.825 --> 11:00.486
Ah! Freeza-sama!

11:00.577 --> 11:01.817
What?!

11:01.911 --> 11:04.038
You fool!

11:30.357 --> 11:32.348
I don't care how much your
battle power has risen,

11:32.442 --> 11:35.809
if you took that unawares,
you don't stand a chance!

11:35.904 --> 11:37.860
You wish.

11:37.947 --> 11:41.280
That was a perfectly pathetic strategy,
coming from someone like you.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.733
I'm stunned.

11:42.827 --> 11:43.907
W-When did you...?

11:43.995 --> 11:49.865
If my battle power has risen,
it means my speed has risen, too!

11:49.959 --> 11:54.794
Which means, you've completely
enraged me with that move!

12:13.858 --> 12:15.473
Die!

12:19.114 --> 12:21.275
What a messy firework.

12:32.585 --> 12:37.375
V-Vegeta's rating of 24,000 was genuine after all.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.127
He defeated Kewie like it was nothing.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.209
It is no great concern.

12:42.303 --> 12:46.171
Now, to look for the fifth Dragon Ball.

12:47.434 --> 12:51.222
Thanks to their Scouters,
they'll know what action I've taken.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.052
Even if I'm careless enough to get close to them,

12:53.148 --> 12:55.730
though I may be able to take Zarbon or Dodoria,

12:55.817 --> 12:58.854
not even I could beat Freeza.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.152
Judging by the transmissions from Freeza's men

13:01.239 --> 13:03.230
that I heard on my Scouter,

13:03.324 --> 13:05.155
the Dragon Balls don't have any effect

13:05.243 --> 13:09.657
unless you have all seven
of them together. All right.

13:09.747 --> 13:14.958
I'll find just one of them.
Once they've gathered the other six,

13:15.044 --> 13:18.628
I'll find an opening to steal them.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.878
If it goes right, I'll have them all,
and gain eternal life.

13:21.968 --> 13:25.335
Then defeating Freeza will
be more than just a dream.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.638
I am reading ten or so
Namekians in that direction.

13:28.725 --> 13:34.436
Very well. It sure would be nice
if they have the fifth Dragon Ball.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.808
Please be sure not to let your guard down.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.686
After all, it appears that there
are some other curious fellows

13:38.776 --> 13:40.607
out there beside Vegeta.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.903
--Yes, sir.
--Now, let us be going.

13:46.784 --> 13:50.493
Once he's out of the way, I'll be Number One.

13:50.580 --> 13:54.869
I, the Saiyan, Vegeta,
will rule the entire universe!

14:00.548 --> 14:02.925
Bulma-san, we have to hurry it up a little more.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.671
We'll be spotted out here.

14:08.097 --> 14:11.931
You guys can fly, right? Then take me and fly.

14:12.018 --> 14:17.388
We'd like to do so, but we have
to walk to mask our presence.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.973
Bulma-san, up there is a good place.

14:20.068 --> 14:23.560
It will be hard to spot us inside that cave.

14:23.655 --> 14:27.273
How long am I going to have
to live in a place like that?

14:30.537 --> 14:31.902
Kuririn-san...

14:31.996 --> 14:34.703
Do you sense any Ki over there?

14:34.791 --> 14:38.579
You're right. These Ki feel
different from those others earlier.

14:38.670 --> 14:41.582
They could really be Namekians this time.

14:41.673 --> 14:45.632
Hide! There are some other Ki
coming this way from over there!

14:45.718 --> 14:47.970
--What, now?
--Come on, hurry!

14:48.054 --> 14:49.919
What in the world is going on?!

14:51.182 --> 14:52.797
They're coming this way.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.679
Do you think they know about us?

14:55.770 --> 14:57.385
I don't know.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.189
They're here!

15:21.212 --> 15:24.204
T-They're gone. Thank goodness.

15:24.299 --> 15:28.508
Apparently, we weren't what
they were after. But then,

15:28.595 --> 15:31.086
what exactly was that just now?

15:35.226 --> 15:37.683
What's the matter, you two?

15:40.607 --> 15:44.475
B-Bulma-san, would you confirm
something with the Dragon Radar?

15:44.569 --> 15:45.979
W-What?

15:46.070 --> 15:48.152
When you checked earlier,

15:48.239 --> 15:51.606
there were four Dragon Balls
gathered together, right?

15:51.701 --> 15:53.612
Would you see where they are now?

15:53.703 --> 15:56.115
All right, I'll look.

15:58.249 --> 16:01.036
All four of them are moving! Which means...

16:01.127 --> 16:02.583
Yeah, no doubt about it!

16:02.670 --> 16:05.412
Those guys just now were
carrying the four Dragon Balls!

16:05.506 --> 16:07.542
T-They were?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.170
I knew it.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.797
Gohan...

16:11.888 --> 16:13.219
Gohan!

16:13.306 --> 16:15.718
--Yes?
--Gohan, did you see him?

16:15.808 --> 16:18.220
The strange one who was
flying second from the front?

16:18.311 --> 16:19.926
Yes.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.637
I sensed a tremendous power from him.

16:22.732 --> 16:27.066
T-The moment I saw him, I was petrified.

16:27.153 --> 16:32.523
H-He could be much, much
worse than even Vegeta.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.279
I-It looked like there were
some other heavy hitters there,

16:35.370 --> 16:37.952
but he, for one, is in a league of his own.

16:38.039 --> 16:41.281
Worse than Vegeta? Oh, no. Who was he?

16:41.376 --> 16:45.665
I-I don't know, but I think
they were Vegeta's friends.

16:45.755 --> 16:48.371
They all had on the same sort of clothing.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.707
Damn it, how are we supposed
to get the Dragon Balls

16:50.802 --> 16:53.464
away from those guys?!

16:53.554 --> 16:54.714
Say, look here.

16:58.476 --> 17:01.183
What's going on? Do they have a Radar, too?

17:01.270 --> 17:02.931
What location is it?

17:03.022 --> 17:05.763
About 14 kilometers in this direction.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.440
Kuririn-san, that's the place where we sensed Ki

17:08.528 --> 17:10.314
that you said could be Namekians.

17:10.405 --> 17:14.444
I'm going to go there and see what's happening.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.614
I'm going, too!

17:15.702 --> 17:17.532
J-Just a minute!

17:17.619 --> 17:20.362
Are you going to leave me here, all by myself?

17:20.455 --> 17:22.117
It's far safer for you to stay here

17:22.208 --> 17:24.324
than it is to fumble your way around.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.579
When you put it that way, you're right.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.536
Okay, we're off.

17:28.631 --> 17:31.122
Hurry back, okay?

17:31.217 --> 17:34.880
Remember, Gohan, hurry, but suppress
your Ki as much as you can.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.552
--Can you do that?
--Yes!

17:36.639 --> 17:38.175
All right!

17:41.185 --> 17:45.303
There they go. I wonder if they're really all right.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.980
Oh yeah, I have to contact Earth.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.398
ReaHy?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.476
So then, are Gohan and the others okay?

17:51.571 --> 17:55.484
Yeah. They did in fact arrive
safely on Planet Namek.

17:55.575 --> 18:00.444
But Gohan and the others aren't
the only ones who went to Namek.

18:00.538 --> 18:04.030
That Saiyan named Vegeta is also there.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.956
Vegeta?! He's there?!

18:06.043 --> 18:09.285
And that's not all. In addition to Vegeta,

18:09.380 --> 18:12.998
there are a over a dozen of
his friends on Planet Namek.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.583
The spaceship they rode
there in was blasted by them,

18:15.678 --> 18:18.044
and they can't get back to Earth now.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.549
W-What?!

18:19.640 --> 18:21.767
What's more, they said that at least one of them

18:21.851 --> 18:24.934
had a Ki that was greater than Vegeta's.

18:25.021 --> 18:29.606
It can't be! A Ki greater than Vegeta's?
There's a guy like that?

18:35.907 --> 18:37.772
Yo, you still alive?

18:37.867 --> 18:41.576
What?! Here I come all this way
to see ya, why the long face?

18:41.662 --> 18:45.246
The senzu beans're finally ready.
Just a few of 'em, though.

18:45.333 --> 18:48.791
Karin-sama said to take all seven
of the senzu beans that're ready.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.961
Wow, all right! That's what I call good timing!

18:52.048 --> 18:53.083
Hurry up and give me one!

18:53.174 --> 18:56.416
S-See here! You mustn't give
strange foods to patients!

18:56.511 --> 18:58.172
Here ya go.

19:14.612 --> 19:17.024
I've been waiting for this moment!

19:18.616 --> 19:24.202
Here it is! Kaio-sama sent this
new gi to me, just for this day!

19:26.624 --> 19:29.582
All right, I'm off to Planet Namek now!

19:29.669 --> 19:32.786
Oh, thanks, I'll take the
remaining senzu beans with me.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.839
Planet Namek? How are
you planning to get there?

19:36.926 --> 19:39.668
When Bulma's daddy came to visit me,

19:39.762 --> 19:44.096
I made sure to ask him to build
me a spaceship, just in case.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.596
A spaceship? You mean like Kami-sama's?

19:47.687 --> 19:50.053
That was made from stuff that ain't from Earth,

19:50.147 --> 19:52.934
so not even Bulma's daddy could pull that off.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.061
S-So then...?

19:55.152 --> 19:57.234
I thought about it hard,

19:57.321 --> 20:02.190
and realized that there are two
other Saiyan spaceships on Earth.

20:02.285 --> 20:04.492
The spaceship my brother came here in,

20:04.579 --> 20:08.367
and the spaceship that I came
to Earth in when I was a kid.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.163
O-Oh, right!

20:10.251 --> 20:12.993
I had Bulma's daddy go look for it.

20:13.087 --> 20:15.624
My brother's blew up with that other one,

20:15.715 --> 20:19.378
but mine was from way back,
so it ended up unharmed.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.596
I'm having him repair and reconstruct it.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.762
Kinto Un!

20:24.849 --> 20:26.385
Okay, I'm gonna go save them.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.931
Mm-hmm.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.729
Take me to Bulma's house!

20:35.860 --> 20:38.317
He's going to save them? From what?

20:38.404 --> 20:40.486
As it turns out...

20:40.573 --> 20:44.816
If things're as hairy as all that,
Why'd that bastard look so happy?

20:44.911 --> 20:47.744
It must be his Saiyan blood, I'd say.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.446
It goes without saying that
he wants to save everyone,

20:50.541 --> 20:51.656
but more than anything,

20:51.751 --> 20:55.209
he seems to get a huge thrill
from fighting someone strong.

20:55.296 --> 21:01.007
That guy ain't normal, all right.
I can't keep up with him.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.176
Unbelievable. To think that
there's someone out there

21:04.263 --> 21:06.845
even stronger than Vegeta!

21:10.269 --> 21:14.182
Dark clouds loom over Planet Namek.

21:14.273 --> 21:18.892
Will it be Vegeta who has his wish granted?

21:18.986 --> 21:24.106
Or will it be the evil mastermind, Freeza?

21:24.200 --> 21:29.911
Hurry, Goku, to Planet Namek,
and its throng of powerful foes!

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yaburekabure omoikiri

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Tobu n da mugen no sora e

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340
Jetto kiryuu ni nokkari

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463
doko demo iku yo sokkou

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Mukoumizu tte saikou

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
Me mo sameru you na aoi chikyuu

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278
kakegaenai kono hoshi yuzurenai kara

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Hajiketobase kamehameha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
Yabame no kono jidai

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575
sekai wo mamoru tame umareta kara

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581
Yaburekabure omoikiri

22:19.672 --> 22:22.789
Yaru n da furupawaa

22:22.883 --> 22:26.842
Kibou ga ore no buki dakara

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171
mirai shinjite

22:36.105 --> 22:38.721
Whoo, this spaceship sure is huge!

22:38.816 --> 22:41.307
I can get to Planet Namek in six days aboard this?

22:41.402 --> 22:44.189
The people of this planet are so stubborn.

22:44.280 --> 22:49.240
They seem to all want to be killed
together, young fellows and all.

22:49.326 --> 22:52.159
Rats, what mean people these guys are!

22:52.246 --> 22:53.907
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:53.998 --> 22:57.456
"Protect the Dragon Balls!
The Namekians' All-out Attack. "

22:57.543 --> 23:00.250
They all look just like Piccolo-san!
