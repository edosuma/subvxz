WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.504
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:02.587 --> 00:05.090
I know you're working
with Saul Berenson.

00:05.173 --> 00:07.300
I also know he just took
a group to Moscow.

00:07.384 --> 00:08.551
Why are they there?

00:08.635 --> 00:10.720
To retrieve Simone Martin.

00:10.804 --> 00:13.515
Imagine Simone Martin back here
saying that publicly,

00:13.598 --> 00:15.725
that everything we've
been blaming on Keane

00:15.809 --> 00:17.310
- is actually Russians.
- A few words

00:17.394 --> 00:20.689
to the Russian ambassador,
and Saul's mission fails.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.988
<i>Plan A at the dacha
went to shit.</i>

00:29.072 --> 00:30.365
<i>Team walked into a trap.</i>

00:30.448 --> 00:32.659
Explain to me how you used
the 25th Amendment

00:32.742 --> 00:35.704
to oust a president
who is not in a coma,

00:35.787 --> 00:37.831
not in any way disabled,

00:37.914 --> 00:40.542
clearly in possession
of her faculties.

00:42.043 --> 00:44.629
<i>Elizabeth Keane
is no longer president.</i>

00:44.713 --> 00:46.881
<i>Whatever authorization
we had has vanished.</i>

00:46.965 --> 00:49.759
There are divisions on their
side we can use against them.

00:49.843 --> 00:51.094
What do you want?

00:51.177 --> 00:53.054
I want Simone Martin.

01:00.895 --> 01:02.814
This whole crazy thing is you.

01:02.897 --> 01:05.692
The Kremlin has lost control.
<i>You</i> are the problem.

01:05.775 --> 01:09.404
What do you think they'll do?
You are expendable.

01:25.044 --> 01:26.838
You good?

01:26.921 --> 01:28.173
Yeah.

01:32.844 --> 01:35.472
Keep down, okay?

02:02.123 --> 02:03.917
They're expecting us
at the embassy?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.794
Yeah.

02:05.877 --> 02:09.297
Was that always the plan?

02:09.380 --> 02:11.633
More or less. Difference
being we didn't expect

02:11.716 --> 02:14.761
- to have Yevgeny on our ass.
- Well, we don't.

02:14.844 --> 02:17.180
Not yet, anyway.

02:17.263 --> 02:19.390
Left here.

02:21.935 --> 02:23.812
<i>Live videos
taken on the ground show</i>

02:23.895 --> 02:25.939
<i>a violent assault in progress
at the headquarters</i>

02:26.022 --> 02:27.774
<i>of the GRU,</i>

02:27.857 --> 02:30.693
<i>Russia's main intelligence
directorate, where personnel</i>

02:30.777 --> 02:32.529
<i>are being dragged outside,</i>

02:32.612 --> 02:36.074
<i>beaten, and held at gunpoint
by members of the SVR,</i>

02:36.157 --> 02:38.159
<i>the Russian
foreign intelligence service,</i>

02:38.243 --> 02:39.577
<i>a modern successor of the KGB.</i>

02:39.661 --> 02:41.788
What is this? What's going on?

02:41.871 --> 02:45.041
Apparently, the Russians
are fighting each other.

02:45.124 --> 02:48.628
Bullshit. It's Saul Berenson,
and you sent him there.

02:48.711 --> 02:50.588
You thought what?
I wouldn't find out?

02:50.672 --> 02:54.843
I wouldn't notice you sent
a damn time bomb to Moscow?

02:54.926 --> 02:58.721
What is he doing?
What's the mission?

02:58.805 --> 03:00.849
He's...

03:00.932 --> 03:03.393
discussing
Russian active measures

03:03.476 --> 03:06.437
with members of
their intelligence community.

03:06.521 --> 03:10.733
Really? That is discussing
active measures?

03:10.817 --> 03:12.986
You don't want to answer
my questions? Fine.

03:13.069 --> 03:15.363
I'll pull him from
the field right now.

03:17.323 --> 03:19.325
Don't do that.

03:21.786 --> 03:25.748
Why not? Why shouldn't I?

03:27.792 --> 03:29.085
Why shouldn't I?

03:29.168 --> 03:32.797
- Simone Martin.
- What about her?

03:32.881 --> 03:35.592
I told you
she's a Russian operative.

03:35.675 --> 03:39.095
<i>- Was</i> a Russian operative.
- No.

03:39.178 --> 03:42.432
She's alive in Moscow.

03:42.515 --> 03:46.561
Saul has gone there
to bring her back.

03:46.644 --> 03:50.273
Simone is GRU.
That's GRU headquarters,

03:50.356 --> 03:52.483
So we assumed it was
part of Saul's mission,

03:52.567 --> 03:55.945
but obviously,
something has gone wrong.

03:56.029 --> 03:58.823
You think?

03:58.907 --> 04:00.491
I should've been
briefed on this.

04:00.575 --> 04:03.995
- You should've briefed me.
- I couldn't take that chance.

04:04.078 --> 04:05.455
What chance?

04:05.538 --> 04:07.165
That I would compromise

04:07.248 --> 04:11.002
an American operation
in progress on the ground?

04:11.085 --> 04:12.211
Yes.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.797
Why on earth
would I do that?

04:14.881 --> 04:19.344
For the same reason you stuck
a knife in my back two days ago.

04:39.739 --> 04:41.616
Saul.

04:43.618 --> 04:45.912
They have the package.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.956
Listen up.

04:48.039 --> 04:50.708
We're going home. We leave now.
Don't go to your rooms.

04:50.792 --> 04:53.336
Go straight
to the parking garage.

04:57.757 --> 05:00.051
Colonel.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.345
Mr. Berenson,
has something happened?

05:02.428 --> 05:03.805
What you predicted.

05:03.888 --> 05:06.474
All the changes in Washington.
I've been recalled.

05:06.557 --> 05:10.520
You're not national security
advisor anymore?

05:10.603 --> 05:12.355
I said recalled, not fired.

05:12.438 --> 05:14.774
New president wants
to consult with me.

05:14.857 --> 05:16.526
He also said I must invite
you and General Yakushin

05:16.609 --> 05:20.113
to Washington to continue
our discussions there.

05:20.196 --> 05:21.906
I'd like that.

05:41.759 --> 05:43.636
This is Saul Berenson.

05:45.304 --> 05:47.515
Get her in the van.

05:48.474 --> 05:50.101
Are we good?

05:50.184 --> 05:53.062
Police escort is waiting
outside. Plane is standing by.

05:53.146 --> 05:55.606
- Thanks, Jim.
- Don't thank me yet.

06:36.606 --> 06:39.150
Stop! Stop!

06:44.113 --> 06:46.365
- What's wrong?
- I want everyone
out of this van.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.034
- Excuse me?
- I said everyone out!

06:48.117 --> 06:50.369
Colonel, calm down.

06:50.453 --> 06:51.662
Turn off the car!

06:51.746 --> 06:54.123
Please, you're making
a fool of yourself.

06:54.207 --> 06:56.876
I am?

07:00.546 --> 07:02.215
<i>Da?</i>

07:18.064 --> 07:21.526
I'm sorry. Misunderstanding.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.486
Have a good flight.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.381
Who keeps calling you?

07:43.464 --> 07:46.342
- It's nobody. No, don't!
- Hey!

07:46.425 --> 07:48.511
Clint. Who?

07:51.180 --> 07:55.017
It's... Janet.
She works for Senator Paley.

07:55.101 --> 07:58.020
Tell me.

08:00.940 --> 08:03.234
She came to my house

08:03.317 --> 08:05.069
to find out what
Saul was doing.

08:05.153 --> 08:08.698
I have no idea how she even
connected me to it.

08:11.826 --> 08:14.537
She threatened you?

08:14.620 --> 08:17.081
And you told her about the plan
to exfiltrate Simone.

08:17.165 --> 08:20.042
That's why the Russians
were waiting at the dacha.

08:21.919 --> 08:24.672
Saul's en route to the airport.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.340
Have you said
anything to anybody

08:26.424 --> 08:29.051
- about what's happening now?
- No, nothing. Not a word.

08:29.135 --> 08:31.137
It's why I'm not
answering the phone.

08:33.598 --> 08:36.058
So she doesn't get any ideas
and try to find us.

08:39.103 --> 08:42.190
I'm really, really sorry.

08:42.273 --> 08:46.235
I'm sorry, too. But right now
I can't let you out of my sight.

08:46.319 --> 08:48.779
Come on. Come.

08:48.863 --> 08:51.949
Sit with me, okay?

09:02.627 --> 09:06.297
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

09:09.175 --> 09:10.593
- Max, can you hear me?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

09:10.676 --> 09:12.929
We're cut off from the embassy.
Where's Saul?

09:13.012 --> 09:16.015
He left the hotel five minutes
ago with the package.

09:16.098 --> 09:18.309
We have to buy time.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.603
40 minutes, maybe an hour,
till they're in the air.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.104
- Where are you going?
- They know the car.

09:22.188 --> 09:23.689
- I have to go on foot.
- I'm not leaving you.

09:23.773 --> 09:25.942
No, it's not up for discussion.
I agreed with Saul.

09:26.025 --> 09:27.360
If things go wrong,
this is the plan.

09:27.443 --> 09:29.195
What, to allow them
to fucking catch you?

09:29.278 --> 09:31.739
No, to buy time for
what really matters,

09:31.822 --> 09:33.449
which is not me,
it's Simone.

09:40.331 --> 09:42.792
They've seen us.

10:11.112 --> 10:13.322
- What station is that?
- Checking.

10:32.258 --> 10:36.846
Remember, we're a bunch
of diplomats heading home.

10:36.929 --> 10:39.473
So you know who you are.

10:40.933 --> 10:43.728
Carrie Mathison.
Your favorite.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.355
- What's happening with her?
- Don't worry about it.

10:46.439 --> 10:49.358
She came over the roof
to get me.

10:49.442 --> 10:52.278
Did you know that?

10:52.361 --> 10:54.697
You're just going
to leave her here?

12:32.420 --> 12:33.838
Saul.

12:39.468 --> 12:41.095
What do you think
you're doing?

12:41.178 --> 12:45.224
This is a diplomatic vehicle.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.643
- You. Out.
- Nobody's going anywhere.

12:47.726 --> 12:50.020
- This man is murderer.
- You're mistaken.

12:50.104 --> 12:54.191
We're United States diplomats.

12:54.275 --> 12:55.818
This man's wanted
with the police.

12:55.901 --> 12:59.363
This man killed somebody
in Sergiyev Posad.

12:59.447 --> 13:01.157
That's the dacha.
They have a photo.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.742
We have diplomatic immunity.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.953
His orders are
to make an arrest.

13:06.036 --> 13:08.581
No, that's not gonna happen.
We have diplomatic immunity.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.791
We're protected
by international law.

13:14.336 --> 13:17.089
Fuck off, asshole!
Lock it! Lock it!

13:23.596 --> 13:26.932
Get me the embassy. Now.

14:20.986 --> 14:23.531
<i>Mr. President,
I have Mr. Berenson for you.</i>

14:23.614 --> 14:24.990
<i>He says it's urgent.</i>

14:25.074 --> 14:27.493
Put him on.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.828
- Mr. Berenson.
<i>- Mr. President,</i>

14:29.912 --> 14:32.414
I'm at Ostafyevo Airport
outside Moscow

14:32.498 --> 14:35.459
on a diplomatic mission
initiated by President Keane.

14:35.543 --> 14:37.253
- I'm aware.
<i>- Then you're aware</i>

14:37.336 --> 14:39.964
<i>of the importance
of our work here.</i>

14:40.047 --> 14:43.425
- What do you want?
<i>- The guards are refusing
to let us board our plane.</i>

14:43.509 --> 14:44.843
<i>I need you to contact
the Russians and remind them</i>

14:44.927 --> 14:46.387
<i>this is a diplomatic mission,</i>

14:46.470 --> 14:48.013
<i>that all of us
have diplomatic immunity</i>

14:48.097 --> 14:49.723
and must be allowed to board.

14:49.807 --> 14:51.225
Why are they holding you?

14:51.308 --> 14:53.143
Police claim a member
of our group is wanted

14:53.227 --> 14:55.729
in connection with
a homicide outside of Moscow.

14:55.813 --> 14:58.274
- And was he involved?
<i>- No, sir.</i>

14:58.357 --> 15:00.067
Mistaken identity.

15:01.402 --> 15:04.780
And has the mission
been a success?

15:07.449 --> 15:09.326
- Sir?
<i>- You heard me.</i>

15:09.410 --> 15:12.162
Has the mission
been a success?

15:13.289 --> 15:14.665
Yes, it has.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.542
<i>But if our situation here</i>

15:16.625 --> 15:20.254
isn't resolved soon,
that will change.

15:20.337 --> 15:23.257
I'll have to
get back to you.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.766
He's got her, doesn't he?

15:32.850 --> 15:34.768
Simone Martin.

15:36.270 --> 15:38.188
So you know she's alive?

15:39.732 --> 15:40.774
Yes.

15:40.858 --> 15:43.027
And not a victim of
Keane's reign of terror,

15:43.110 --> 15:45.112
- as you've been saying.
- No.

15:45.195 --> 15:47.823
But that's not
the issue now.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.867
And what is the issue?

15:49.950 --> 15:52.369
If Saul Berenson returns
with Simone Martin

15:52.453 --> 15:53.871
to the United States,

15:53.954 --> 15:56.457
Keane'll be sitting behind
this desk again,

15:56.540 --> 16:00.085
feeling vindicated
and vindictive.

16:00.169 --> 16:03.213
You'll be back
to opening state fairs

16:03.297 --> 16:06.800
and Boy Scout jamborees.

16:06.884 --> 16:09.678
- What do you advise?
- The Russian ambassador was

16:09.762 --> 16:12.681
waiting in the Roosevelt Room
when I came in.

16:12.765 --> 16:15.684
Said he's been asking
to see you all morning.

16:15.768 --> 16:18.228
- Tell him the truth.
- Which is?

16:18.312 --> 16:20.564
You didn't send Berenson
to Moscow.

16:20.648 --> 16:23.275
You didn't cause
all this unrest.

16:23.359 --> 16:25.611
You are not responsible

16:25.694 --> 16:29.573
for Elizabeth Keane's
brinksmanship.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.841
Max, are you there?

17:28.924 --> 17:31.510
- Yeah.
<i>- Please tell me
Saul's on the plane.</i>

17:31.593 --> 17:33.971
No. There's a problem
at the airfield.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.974
<i>- They're not being
allowed to board.</i>
- Jesus.

17:54.658 --> 17:55.909
Mr. President.

17:55.993 --> 17:57.828
Mr. Ambassador,
sorry to keep you waiting.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.038
It's been a hell of a morning.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.707
Forgive me for getting
straight to the point,

18:01.790 --> 18:04.710
but events in Moscow are
causing us great concern.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.044
Mm, as they are me.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.630
Especially because we have
clear evidence

18:08.714 --> 18:11.467
they were instigated by
members of your own...

18:11.550 --> 18:13.969
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I think we have this

18:14.052 --> 18:16.305
the wrong way around.
I asked to see you,

18:16.388 --> 18:18.307
because right now
there's a situation

18:18.390 --> 18:20.601
developing at
Ostafyevo Airport.

18:20.684 --> 18:22.519
Your security forces
are preventing

18:22.603 --> 18:26.023
Saul Berenson and his team
from leaving the country.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.900
In fact,
they're being detained.

18:27.983 --> 18:29.485
I want them released
immediately.

18:29.568 --> 18:31.737
Mr. President, this is not
at all what we discussed.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.281
Let me finish, Senator.

18:34.364 --> 18:37.075
Mr. Berenson is there
on a diplomatic mission

18:37.159 --> 18:39.453
and therefore
has diplomatic immunity...

18:39.536 --> 18:43.457
- But he has flouted...
- ...no different than you.

18:43.540 --> 18:46.794
And if he and his people aren't
allowed to board their plane

18:46.877 --> 18:50.547
in the next five minutes,
I will close your embassy,

18:50.631 --> 18:54.343
and I will detain
every single Russian diplomat,

18:54.426 --> 18:57.262
starting with you.

18:59.890 --> 19:02.601
Call Moscow.

19:02.684 --> 19:04.603
Let Mr. Berenson go.

19:06.939 --> 19:09.024
And you, Senator,

19:09.107 --> 19:12.194
you can get the fuck
out of my White House.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.580
- Carrie.
- Yeah?

19:23.664 --> 19:25.332
<i>Anson made it
into the embassy.</i>

19:25.415 --> 19:28.168
Oh, thank God. What about Saul?

19:28.252 --> 19:30.963
<i>Not yet.</i>

19:31.046 --> 19:32.297
Saul.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.990
Max, I haven't got
much longer.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.658
<i>I'm with you, Carrie.</i>

20:14.464 --> 20:17.759
Drive.

20:43.201 --> 20:46.204
You.

20:50.125 --> 20:53.003
<i>Carrie, Saul is away.</i>

21:45.389 --> 21:47.349
<i>Security
is unusually tight today,</i>

21:47.432 --> 21:48.976
<i>ahead of Simone Martin's
testimony</i>

21:49.059 --> 21:51.186
<i>before the Senate
Intelligence Committee,</i>

21:51.269 --> 21:53.188
<i>testimony widely expected to be</i>

21:53.271 --> 21:55.691
<i>a complete vindication
of Elizabeth Keane,</i>

21:55.774 --> 21:58.318
<i>who was removed from office
five days ago.</i>

21:58.402 --> 22:00.487
<i>Senator Sam Paley,
who led that effort,</i>

22:00.570 --> 22:03.115
<i>was himself arrested
Tuesday morning</i>

22:03.198 --> 22:05.117
<i>in a dawn raid by the FBI</i>

22:05.200 --> 22:07.244
<i>and charged
with criminally conspiring</i>

22:07.327 --> 22:08.745
<i>with a foreign power.</i>

22:08.829 --> 22:10.414
<i>His chief of staff,
Janet Bayne,</i>

22:10.497 --> 22:13.208
<i>is said to be cooperating
with investigators.</i>

22:13.291 --> 22:15.335
<i>Meanwhile,
back at the White House,</i>

22:15.419 --> 22:17.921
<i>Ms. Keane is scheduled to be
re-sworn into office</i>

22:18.005 --> 22:20.173
<i>at noon Eastern Standard Time.</i>

22:20.257 --> 22:23.385
<i>Sources tell CNB
her first official act will be</i>

22:23.468 --> 22:25.679
<i>to sign a series
of executive orders</i>

22:25.762 --> 22:29.641
<i>dramatically expanding
sanctions against Russia.</i>

22:29.725 --> 22:33.311
<i>It appears Simone Martin has
just entered the hearing room.</i>

22:33.395 --> 22:34.730
<i>Let's watch.</i>

22:52.539 --> 22:55.292
In accordance with
the practice of the committee,

22:55.375 --> 22:58.712
would the witness
please rise and be sworn?

23:00.839 --> 23:02.257
<i>Do you swear that all
the testimony you will give</i>

23:02.340 --> 23:04.301
<i>in this proceeding will be
the truth, the whole truth,</i>

23:04.384 --> 23:07.012
<i>and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?</i>

23:07.095 --> 23:09.181
- I do.
- Be seated.

23:11.475 --> 23:13.268
Would you state
your full name, please?

23:13.351 --> 23:16.438
<i>- Simone Marie Martin.
- Ms. Martin,</i>

23:16.521 --> 23:18.607
<i>the Committee thanks you for
your appearance here today.</i>

23:18.690 --> 23:20.317
<i>There's a lot riding on</i>

23:20.400 --> 23:22.778
what you have to say, so
I'd like to just jump right in,

23:22.861 --> 23:25.155
if that's okay with you.

23:25.238 --> 23:27.115
Would you tell
the American people

23:27.199 --> 23:29.534
what the GRU is?

23:31.495 --> 23:34.956
<i>The GRU is a foreign military
intelligence agency</i>

23:35.040 --> 23:37.000
<i>of the general staff
of the armed forces</i>

23:37.084 --> 23:38.502
<i>of the Russian Federation.</i>

23:38.585 --> 23:41.546
What is your relationship
to that organization?

23:41.630 --> 23:44.508
I'm a captain in the GRU.

23:45.675 --> 23:48.136
That one's for you, Carrie.

23:48.220 --> 23:50.472
<i>Could you describe
for us, please,</i>

23:50.555 --> 23:52.641
<i>what a captain does, exactly?</i>

23:52.724 --> 23:54.518
Different things.

23:54.601 --> 23:57.354
Me, I'm an operations officer.
I work in the field.

23:57.437 --> 24:00.816
Ms. Martin, what was
your most recent operation?

24:05.028 --> 24:08.824
I was part of a team
sent here to disrupt

24:08.907 --> 24:11.827
the American political system.

24:11.910 --> 24:14.579
<i>How?</i>

24:14.663 --> 24:17.040
<i>By any means necessary.</i>

24:17.124 --> 24:20.836
<i>Give me an example
of what you tried to do.</i>

24:22.838 --> 24:26.466
Come on, baby,
just say it.

24:28.969 --> 24:31.263
We tried to compromise
your president

24:31.346 --> 24:33.348
and push her out of office.

24:33.431 --> 24:34.850
Yes!

24:37.644 --> 24:39.688
Feels good, doesn't it?

24:42.566 --> 24:44.317
To finally hear the truth.

24:46.153 --> 24:48.238
- Yeah.
- Sure does.

24:50.448 --> 24:52.534
You have no fucking idea.

24:57.164 --> 25:01.001
So this is the room
where it happened.

25:03.420 --> 25:06.089
Well, I wanted to come
and meet you all

25:06.173 --> 25:07.924
and say thank you.

25:11.094 --> 25:12.846
So, thank you.

25:15.182 --> 25:18.602
You guys kicked ass.

25:19.978 --> 25:21.396
I also wanted to tell you

25:21.479 --> 25:24.941
that I am doing
everything in my power

25:25.025 --> 25:30.030
to bring Carrie Mathison home.
Everything.

25:33.408 --> 25:36.870
You have my solemn promise
on that.

25:43.877 --> 25:46.213
Come on, Saul.
Introduce me to everybody.

25:46.296 --> 25:50.383
- Sandy Langmore.
- It's an honor to meet you,
Madam President.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.260
- Clint Prower.
- Hi.

25:52.344 --> 25:54.471
- Hi.
- Max Pietrowski.

25:54.554 --> 25:56.723
Hi.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.826
How's the book?

26:16.910 --> 26:19.788
It's good.

26:19.871 --> 26:22.707
Passes time.

26:22.791 --> 26:26.294
Yes. Thanks for
letting me have it.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.465
Come.

27:13.550 --> 27:15.844
Right. Of course.

27:18.763 --> 27:21.182
I guess this means
Simone's already testified,

27:21.266 --> 27:22.934
or is about to.

27:23.018 --> 27:24.394
Sit down.

27:24.477 --> 27:27.188
Well, I'm not gonna save
your asses now by reading

27:27.272 --> 27:31.151
some stupid statement saying
this was all a CIA plot.

27:31.234 --> 27:35.071
Oh, I think you will.

27:35.155 --> 27:38.074
What's the point, anyway?

27:38.158 --> 27:40.118
People will know
the statement was coerced.

27:40.201 --> 27:42.704
- No one will believe it.
- They don't have to.

27:42.787 --> 27:45.623
As long as the seed of doubt
is planted,

27:45.707 --> 27:47.334
that's all I need--

27:47.417 --> 27:50.795
something to water
and let grow.

27:52.756 --> 27:55.592
More reason
not to do it.

28:00.638 --> 28:03.058
Your medication.

28:03.141 --> 28:06.561
Your new medication.

28:06.644 --> 28:09.105
Yes, I know all
about that.

28:11.816 --> 28:13.526
Am I supposed
to be impressed?

28:13.610 --> 28:15.278
No, you're supposed
to ask yourself

28:15.362 --> 28:18.281
how do you want to spend
the rest of your days here--

28:18.365 --> 28:20.742
reading nice books
that Aleksandr brings you

28:20.825 --> 28:23.787
and exercising in the yard,

28:23.870 --> 28:26.956
or gone mad,

28:27.040 --> 28:29.959
locked up in an asylum?

28:32.045 --> 28:34.255
Make the statement.

28:34.339 --> 28:37.592
Admit your guilt,
apologize to the Russian people,

28:37.675 --> 28:41.513
and the pills are yours
as long as you need them.

28:49.687 --> 28:53.358
I said no.

28:53.441 --> 28:55.902
It will be months, Carrie.

28:58.405 --> 28:59.572
Maybe longer.

28:59.656 --> 29:02.826
Very powerful men
are upset.

29:02.909 --> 29:06.996
They're not gonna exchange
you soon, or for nothing.

29:17.549 --> 29:19.634
Think about it.

29:19.717 --> 29:22.971
You have till tomorrow
to decide.

29:23.054 --> 29:24.514
Aleksandr!

29:44.451 --> 29:47.412
Not yet.
Still a work in progress.

29:47.495 --> 29:49.497
Tell them they'll get
the full draft

29:49.581 --> 29:52.125
three hours before air.

29:54.961 --> 29:58.006
Well, that's up
to the president.

29:58.089 --> 29:59.841
Hold on. I'll ask her.

30:02.051 --> 30:04.262
Reiko's wondering
if she should mention that

30:04.345 --> 30:07.015
you chose tomorrow night
for the address

30:07.098 --> 30:11.227
because it's the anniversary
of Andrew's death.

30:12.896 --> 30:15.148
You know the answer to that.

30:15.231 --> 30:17.066
My son's off-limits.

30:19.777 --> 30:21.196
That would be a no.

30:21.279 --> 30:25.241
And, uh, I'll get back
to you on the other thing.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.164
What about me?

30:31.247 --> 30:33.291
When do I get
to see a draft?

30:33.374 --> 30:36.461
When I'm ready
to show it to you.

30:54.270 --> 30:56.356
Also, the vice president's
been asking

30:56.439 --> 30:59.025
for a moment of your time
after the re-swearing in.

30:59.108 --> 31:01.402
- What for?
- No idea.

31:01.486 --> 31:04.489
Well, find out. Then put him
back in his doll box

31:04.572 --> 31:07.617
and close the lid.
I'm done playing with him.

31:59.168 --> 32:02.297
Thank you.

32:05.049 --> 32:07.051
- Hello, Ralph.
- Madam President.

32:07.135 --> 32:08.303
Not quite yet.

32:09.762 --> 32:11.180
Thanks for holding down
the fort.

32:11.264 --> 32:13.766
It was
the honor of my life.

32:16.644 --> 32:19.731
And to all of you
for having my back...

32:19.814 --> 32:22.317
...thank you.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.985
Mr. Chief Justice.

32:24.068 --> 32:25.403
Ma'am.

32:25.486 --> 32:28.698
- Whenever you're ready.
- Now's good.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.952
Excuse me.

32:34.329 --> 32:36.205
Please place your left hand
on the Bible

32:36.289 --> 32:39.083
and raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

32:39.167 --> 32:41.628
Is it the same oath I swore
a hundred days ago?

32:41.711 --> 32:43.546
Yes, ma'am.

32:43.630 --> 32:45.006
Then I'm pretty sure
I got it down.

32:51.095 --> 32:54.891
I do solemnly swear that
I shall faithfully execute

32:54.974 --> 32:58.728
the office of the president
of the United States

32:58.811 --> 33:02.106
and will, to the best
of my ability,

33:02.190 --> 33:05.777
preserve, protect,
and defend

33:05.860 --> 33:09.614
the Constitution
of the United States.

33:09.697 --> 33:13.242
Hear, hear.

33:32.136 --> 33:34.222
Aleksandr...

33:34.305 --> 33:36.391
I need to ask you something.

33:36.474 --> 33:38.768
Of course.

33:38.851 --> 33:40.687
Come in a second.

33:50.697 --> 33:53.491
Yevgeny has
a bottle of pills--

33:53.574 --> 33:56.452
the medication I take.

33:56.536 --> 33:58.413
Without it...

33:58.496 --> 33:59.831
I'll lose my mind.

33:59.914 --> 34:02.542
I'll... go insane.

34:05.503 --> 34:09.090
I would do anything,

34:09.173 --> 34:11.050
anything...

34:16.848 --> 34:19.308
I don't know
if it's possible.

34:26.899 --> 34:28.901
I will try.

34:47.545 --> 34:50.423
- David said you wanted a word.
- I do.

34:50.506 --> 34:51.799
Please.

34:51.883 --> 34:55.720
Is it true about
the new round of sanctions

34:55.803 --> 34:57.680
you're planning to announce
tomorrow?

34:57.764 --> 35:00.975
It is. Am I overplaying?

35:01.058 --> 35:03.853
Not at all. The American
people need to know

35:03.936 --> 35:07.315
exactly where you stand
on Russia and why.

35:07.398 --> 35:08.775
What, then?

35:08.858 --> 35:11.694
The policy isn't the problem.
The method is.

35:11.778 --> 35:15.448
Executive orders
governing by fiat.

35:15.531 --> 35:18.868
I think you're-you're
missing an opportunity here.

35:18.951 --> 35:20.369
How so?

35:20.453 --> 35:23.915
The Russian rebuke is
the perfect bipartisan issue.

35:23.998 --> 35:26.667
Instead
of acting unilaterally,

35:26.751 --> 35:30.087
why not bring Congress in
as a partner?

35:32.757 --> 35:36.344
Because it's handing our agenda
over to a legislative body

35:36.427 --> 35:38.721
that has forgotten
how to legislate.

35:38.805 --> 35:41.182
You're right, of course.

35:41.265 --> 35:44.435
It's not with-without
its risks.

35:44.519 --> 35:47.522
But the upside is huge.

35:47.605 --> 35:48.940
Build a bridge now

35:49.023 --> 35:52.527
and push our domestic program
across it later.

35:52.610 --> 35:55.863
Exactly.

35:57.824 --> 36:01.077
I'm not sure
the timing is right.

36:02.995 --> 36:05.248
In this town,

36:05.331 --> 36:08.459
it's never a bad time to try
a new way of doing things.

36:08.543 --> 36:11.796
Otherwise, it's just Democrats
and Republicans,

36:11.879 --> 36:15.299
Republicans and Democrats,
whipsawing the country to death.

36:15.383 --> 36:17.468
Tell you what, Ralph.

36:17.552 --> 36:19.387
Let me think about it.

36:20.847 --> 36:22.431
Of course, Madam President.

36:22.515 --> 36:25.935
- David.
- Thank you.

36:33.109 --> 36:34.986
I can't believe you were
going for that.

36:35.069 --> 36:36.737
Oh, I don't know.
It didn't sound like such

36:36.821 --> 36:39.448
- a terrible idea to me.
- Come on.

36:39.532 --> 36:41.826
The man has instincts,
Elizabeth, and skills.

36:41.909 --> 36:43.578
Even the other side
likes him.

36:43.661 --> 36:46.163
But it's our foot on
their throats for once.

36:46.247 --> 36:48.791
I think that's his point.
Sooner or later,

36:48.875 --> 36:51.669
someone's gonna have to stop
this vicious cycle

36:51.752 --> 36:54.338
of partisan advantage
and start exercising

36:54.422 --> 36:58.593
- some restraint when in power.
- Does it have to be me?

37:00.136 --> 37:02.889
Okay, okay.

37:02.972 --> 37:06.267
I said I'll think about it.

37:06.350 --> 37:09.937
I will.

37:37.131 --> 37:38.549
What else?

37:38.633 --> 37:42.136
Did I hear you say that
Paley's been asking to see me?

37:42.219 --> 37:44.513
I'll just tell him
to piss off.

37:44.597 --> 37:46.349
Actually, no,
don't do that.

37:46.432 --> 37:50.019
Him, I might want
to talk to.

38:13.334 --> 38:15.920
I see three names,
but no Alexei Gorin.

38:16.003 --> 38:18.881
Gorin's a deal-breaker.

38:18.965 --> 38:20.883
If she's really
that valuable...

38:20.967 --> 38:24.845
I told you, I can't make Gorin
happen even if I wanted to.

38:27.598 --> 38:31.268
- Too bad.
- Chrissake.

38:31.352 --> 38:33.187
I'm offering you three
of the highest-level captures

38:33.270 --> 38:34.981
in the last decade.

38:35.064 --> 38:38.526
No one back in Moscow is much
in the mood to negotiate anyway.

38:38.609 --> 38:41.278
Maybe it's better
if you wait a few months.

38:41.362 --> 38:42.905
I can't wait a few months.

38:42.989 --> 38:46.283
I don't even know if she'll
be alive in a few months.

38:46.367 --> 38:49.787
Then... put Gorin back
on the list.

39:05.052 --> 39:07.430
Come on in.

39:22.194 --> 39:23.863
Madam President.

39:30.202 --> 39:33.456
I let
a terrible thing happen.

39:33.539 --> 39:36.208
People died.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.335
I beg your forgiveness.

39:41.464 --> 39:43.257
I'm not asking for me.

39:43.340 --> 39:47.928
I know I'm not getting out
of this place anytime soon.

39:48.012 --> 39:52.391
I'm asking for my family--
my wife, Sally,

39:52.475 --> 39:56.604
my boys, Harry and Sam Jr.--

39:56.687 --> 39:59.482
all blameless.

40:04.320 --> 40:07.573
I've been in public life
for 40 years.

40:07.656 --> 40:10.951
My first job--
animal control lieutenant,

40:11.035 --> 40:12.578
Pima County, Arizona.

40:12.661 --> 40:15.748
Literally the dog catcher.

40:17.416 --> 40:21.670
I haven't spent a day
in private sector.

40:21.754 --> 40:25.966
Never used any of my positions,
including United States Senate,

40:26.050 --> 40:28.094
to enrich myself.

40:28.177 --> 40:30.012
Maybe it's hard
for you to believe,

40:30.096 --> 40:33.724
but... I'm not a wealthy man.

40:33.808 --> 40:37.103
And without my pension,

40:37.186 --> 40:40.564
my family won't...
won't have enough to live on.

40:44.318 --> 40:47.363
Sally... you know...

40:47.446 --> 40:50.491
is not well.

41:17.393 --> 41:20.563
Elizabeth...

41:20.646 --> 41:23.899
please, I'm begging you.

41:25.109 --> 41:27.528
Punish me, not them.

41:36.829 --> 41:39.540
For God's sake,
say something.

43:03.249 --> 43:04.959
Dinner.

43:08.587 --> 43:12.007
Cauliflower
and carrot stroganoff.

43:12.091 --> 43:14.468
It is not horrible.

43:14.551 --> 43:16.262
Thanks.

43:25.062 --> 43:26.814
Thank you.

43:26.897 --> 43:28.899
Welcome.

43:32.236 --> 43:35.406
Come back later tonight?

45:56.171 --> 45:58.507
Reschedule for
our first press conference,

45:58.590 --> 46:00.342
and Todd will take care
of that...

46:00.426 --> 46:03.262
Let's go, guys.
Mic check. Where's the stand-in?

46:05.389 --> 46:08.058
- What's going on?
- POTUS changed her mind.

46:08.142 --> 46:09.726
- I thought you knew.
- Where is she?

46:09.810 --> 46:12.479
In the residence.
She asked not to be disturbed.

46:19.445 --> 46:22.448
Come in.

46:23.782 --> 46:27.202
Um... could-could
we have a moment, please?

46:27.286 --> 46:28.912
No, stay.

46:30.164 --> 46:32.791
Don't look so worried, David.

46:34.501 --> 46:36.753
We discussed this--
the East Room,

46:36.837 --> 46:39.214
the power walk to the podium,
you're always better

46:39.298 --> 46:41.508
- in front of a live audience.
- I'll be fine.

46:41.592 --> 46:44.928
Don't tell me you'll be fine.
Tell me what's going on.

46:45.012 --> 46:48.056
You're the one who wanted me
to listen to the vice president.

46:48.140 --> 46:52.352
- Well, I have.
- Okay.

46:52.436 --> 46:54.563
That's why I'm moving
the speech to the Oval.

46:54.646 --> 46:57.774
I want to sit down
and speak directly

46:57.858 --> 47:00.152
to the American people
from the heart,

47:00.235 --> 47:03.405
- like I did after Lucasville.
- Well, that is hardly the speech

47:03.489 --> 47:04.907
that's on the teleprompter
right now.

47:04.990 --> 47:07.034
I'm not going to use
the teleprompter.

47:07.117 --> 47:09.203
- What?
- You heard me.

47:09.286 --> 47:12.748
I'm gonna wing it,
let the spirit move me.

47:12.831 --> 47:15.918
You're kidding.

47:16.001 --> 47:17.211
I'm not.

47:17.294 --> 47:19.213
You're prepared to blow
your one chance

47:19.296 --> 47:23.217
to reintroduce yourself
to the country?

47:23.300 --> 47:25.886
There is still time.

47:25.969 --> 47:28.096
Let me and Josh
whip something up for you.

47:28.180 --> 47:31.016
No.

47:32.476 --> 47:34.811
Trust me, David.

47:34.895 --> 47:36.897
I got this.

48:06.969 --> 48:09.471
Well?

48:09.555 --> 48:11.014
What?

48:11.098 --> 48:13.976
Time's up.
You gotta decide.

48:15.394 --> 48:18.438
I told you. I'm not doing it.
No statement.

48:18.522 --> 48:21.942
Shame.

48:22.025 --> 48:24.903
I was really hoping you'd
make it easy for both of us.

48:24.987 --> 48:26.822
Tough shit.

48:26.905 --> 48:30.742
You know, it's really not
that much to ask.

48:30.826 --> 48:33.161
Surely I can
change your mind.

48:33.245 --> 48:36.415
Not a chance.

48:36.498 --> 48:40.919
Even if I told you that
Aleksandr has been reassigned.

48:41.003 --> 48:44.214
Consular security in Zurich.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.719
Aleksandr!

48:54.057 --> 48:56.685
You should congratulate him.
It's a promotion.

48:56.768 --> 49:00.314
Congratulations.

49:00.397 --> 49:03.525
And that pill

49:03.609 --> 49:06.528
he brought you last night?

49:08.447 --> 49:09.615
Sugar.

49:12.451 --> 49:15.579
I'm sorry to play with
your emotions like this,

49:15.662 --> 49:17.706
but I hope you can see
your situation

49:17.789 --> 49:20.208
a lot more clearly now.

49:22.294 --> 49:24.087
Fuck you.

49:25.547 --> 49:29.343
Last chance.
Read the statement.

49:29.426 --> 49:31.595
I won't ask again.

49:34.514 --> 49:36.850
Go to hell.

49:36.933 --> 49:38.894
No.

49:41.146 --> 49:45.025
I believe that's where
you're going.

50:17.683 --> 50:19.476
Of course, yeah.

50:19.559 --> 50:21.478
Is the script good to go?

50:21.561 --> 50:22.688
She's gonna be using it?

50:29.653 --> 50:32.531
Stand by studio, 15 seconds.

50:35.117 --> 50:36.952
Okay, everybody,
settle down now.

50:37.035 --> 50:40.956
Nice and quiet.
Eight seconds to air.

50:41.039 --> 50:43.500
Five, four,

50:43.583 --> 50:46.211
three, two...

50:46.294 --> 50:48.004
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

50:48.088 --> 50:49.798
<i>the president of
the United States.</i>

50:49.881 --> 50:53.218
Good evening.

50:53.301 --> 50:56.096
I was going to read
a prepared speech tonight

50:56.179 --> 50:59.641
about how Russia
has waged a covert war

50:59.725 --> 51:03.562
on my presidency
and on our country.

51:03.645 --> 51:06.606
Those of you who watched
the Senate hearings yesterday

51:06.690 --> 51:08.900
know what I'm talking about.

51:08.984 --> 51:11.570
You should also know
that none of this is new.

51:11.653 --> 51:14.823
We have been under one form
of Russian attack or another

51:14.906 --> 51:16.450
since the 1950s.

51:16.533 --> 51:19.411
<i>What's different today</i>

51:19.494 --> 51:22.330
<i>is what an easy target we are,</i>

51:22.414 --> 51:24.541
<i>as deeply divided a nation</i>

51:24.624 --> 51:27.794
<i>as I can remember.</i>

51:27.878 --> 51:31.631
For this, I must share
some of the blame.

51:31.715 --> 51:34.050
The attack on my life
earlier this year...

51:36.928 --> 51:39.222
It scared the hell out of me.

51:39.306 --> 51:43.977
Then it made me really angry,

51:44.060 --> 51:46.480
and then I tried to get even.

51:46.563 --> 51:49.483
I wasn't above using
the power of this office

51:49.566 --> 51:52.319
to lash out at my enemies.

51:52.402 --> 51:55.322
I don't believe
it was against the law,

51:55.405 --> 51:58.658
but it was wrong.

51:58.742 --> 52:01.745
For over 200 years,

52:01.828 --> 52:05.540
we have had an angel on
our shoulder in this country.

52:06.625 --> 52:08.293
Lately...

52:08.376 --> 52:11.671
I've been wondering
where she's gone.

52:11.755 --> 52:13.632
Look around.

52:13.715 --> 52:16.802
We're in trouble.
Our democracy is.

52:16.885 --> 52:19.763
And it is not Russia's fault.
It is ours.

52:19.846 --> 52:22.474
<i>We are the ones killing it.</i>

52:22.557 --> 52:25.018
<i>When we think
of democracies dying,</i>

52:25.101 --> 52:26.812
<i>we think of revolutions,</i>

52:26.895 --> 52:29.189
of military coup d'etats,

52:29.272 --> 52:31.566
of armed men in the street.

52:31.650 --> 52:35.153
<i>But that's less and less
how it happens anymore.</i>

52:35.237 --> 52:38.156
<i>Turkey, Poland, Hungary,</i>

52:38.240 --> 52:41.243
<i>Nicaragua, the Philippines.</i>

52:41.326 --> 52:43.662
<i>Democracies now die</i>

52:43.745 --> 52:45.372
<i>when we're not looking,</i>

52:45.455 --> 52:47.415
<i>when we're not paying
attention.</i>

52:47.499 --> 52:51.253
<i>And the end rarely comes
in an instant,</i>

52:51.336 --> 52:54.047
but arrives slowly,

52:54.130 --> 52:56.216
like twilight.

52:56.299 --> 52:58.051
And at first,

52:58.134 --> 53:01.471
our eyes don't notice.

53:05.392 --> 53:07.519
I spent much of the afternoon

53:07.602 --> 53:09.646
with Vice President Warner,

53:09.729 --> 53:13.525
who I have come to know as
a deeply honorable

53:13.608 --> 53:14.985
and decent man.

53:15.068 --> 53:19.614
He and I agree our country
is at a crisis point,

53:19.698 --> 53:21.825
locked in
an existential conflict

53:21.908 --> 53:26.121
over race and identity
and culture.

53:26.204 --> 53:28.206
The signs are everywhere

53:28.290 --> 53:30.584
<i>and flashing red.</i>

53:30.667 --> 53:33.128
<i>Something must change.</i>

53:33.211 --> 53:36.798
<i>Something bold must be done.</i>

53:36.882 --> 53:41.094
I don't pretend
to have all the answers,

53:41.177 --> 53:45.891
but I do know I have become
part of the problem.

53:45.974 --> 53:48.476
I open my mouth,

53:48.560 --> 53:50.937
and half of you
hear only lies.

53:51.021 --> 53:54.566
That's not only unacceptable,

53:54.649 --> 53:57.777
but unlikely to change
anytime soon.

54:02.407 --> 54:06.244
No single leader
can save a democracy,

54:06.328 --> 54:08.955
but without a leader
you can trust,

54:09.039 --> 54:12.667
no democracy can be saved.

54:12.751 --> 54:15.462
For that reason,
effective midnight tonight,

54:15.545 --> 54:18.506
I hereby resign the presidency
of the United States.

54:18.590 --> 54:21.051
The vice president will be

54:21.134 --> 54:24.054
<i>sworn in as president
at that time</i>

54:24.137 --> 54:26.139
in this office.

54:28.224 --> 54:32.771
People will say I'm stepping
down because I'm weak.

54:32.854 --> 54:34.189
I'm not.

54:34.272 --> 54:38.234
I am as strong
as I have ever been.

54:38.318 --> 54:41.655
People will say
it's because I'm a woman.

54:41.738 --> 54:44.324
Well, if it takes a woman
to shock this country

54:44.407 --> 54:47.911
back to its senses, so be it.

54:51.623 --> 54:55.293
So let's make a promise
here tonight--

54:55.377 --> 54:57.671
an American promise

54:57.754 --> 54:59.631
to each other--

54:59.714 --> 55:03.343
that instead of scorching
the earth between us,

55:03.426 --> 55:06.304
we will try every day

55:06.388 --> 55:09.391
to find common ground.

55:10.850 --> 55:12.227
There will be

55:12.310 --> 55:14.604
<i>a new president
in the morning.</i>

55:14.688 --> 55:16.564
<i>Help him.</i>

55:16.648 --> 55:19.609
<i>Pray for him.</i>

55:19.693 --> 55:23.196
Our future depends on it.

55:23.279 --> 55:26.783
Good night,
and God bless America.

56:33.141 --> 56:36.811
They're moving our way.

56:36.895 --> 56:39.314
Can we confirm it's her?

56:39.397 --> 56:41.191
90%.

56:43.318 --> 56:44.986
What shape's she in?

56:45.070 --> 56:46.321
Hard to tell.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.962
Shouldn't we be moving, too?

57:03.046 --> 57:04.631
Not yet.

57:04.714 --> 57:08.510
Wanna see her first
with my own eyes.

57:43.169 --> 57:45.964
That's her.

57:46.047 --> 57:47.632
Get the prisoners.

57:56.182 --> 57:58.518
Christ. Is that Gorin?

58:00.645 --> 58:02.188
Yeah.

58:02.272 --> 58:04.691
I had no idea.

59:17.597 --> 59:20.183
Carrie?

59:20.266 --> 59:23.937
Carrie.
You all right?

59:24.020 --> 59:25.647
Carrie.

59:33.238 --> 59:35.156
Carrie?
