00:02.125 --> 00:04.404
Josslyn Carver... Will you marry me?

00:04.429 --> 00:07.947
<i>- Yes! Yes!
- Previously on "Mistresses"...</i>

00:07.971 --> 00:10.527
- I like to live a certain way.
- Why me?

00:10.552 --> 00:12.608
You were just the easiest target, you know?

00:12.642 --> 00:14.799
[Engine revs]

00:15.555 --> 00:18.106
Karen: Anna's staying with
me. I don't know for how long.

00:18.131 --> 00:20.024
You have always led with your heart,

00:20.049 --> 00:21.651
and that's why I love you.

00:22.218 --> 00:24.186
April Malloy here to see agent Thomas.

00:24.220 --> 00:25.387
Do you have an appointment?

00:25.421 --> 00:28.390
I am here to find out why the FBI bugged

00:28.424 --> 00:30.058
my 12-year-old daughter's bedroom.

00:30.093 --> 00:31.694
Do I need an appointment for that?

00:33.429 --> 00:34.568
Daniel?

00:36.665 --> 00:37.799
Daniel?

00:37.833 --> 00:39.172
If we do that...

00:41.033 --> 00:43.305
What are you doing here?

00:43.339 --> 00:44.959
Um...

00:47.595 --> 00:49.116
Let's go into my office

00:49.141 --> 00:51.142
- so we can discuss this in private.
- Your office?

00:53.716 --> 00:55.229
April, um...

00:56.984 --> 00:58.652
I work for the FBI.

00:58.921 --> 01:00.423
[Exhales sharply]

01:01.286 --> 01:03.667
What? Are you telling me
this whole thing was a lie?

01:03.692 --> 01:05.358
How is that even possible?

01:05.382 --> 01:07.851
- I met you at an art show.
- You were brought there.

01:08.196 --> 01:09.830
No, I wasn't.

01:09.864 --> 01:12.704
I-I-I went with my girlfriends
and my friend Mickey.

01:15.979 --> 01:18.272
You used Mickey to get me there?

01:18.306 --> 01:20.659
- It wasn't...
- As I told you the other day,

01:20.684 --> 01:22.285
this is an extremely important case.

01:22.310 --> 01:23.443
Yeah, I got that.

01:23.711 --> 01:24.711
April...

01:24.746 --> 01:26.509
if you wanted information about Paul,

01:26.534 --> 01:28.167
why didn't you just come
to me in the first place?!

01:28.192 --> 01:29.878
Why would you go through all this trouble

01:29.903 --> 01:31.141
just to humiliate me?!

01:31.166 --> 01:32.633
Thomas: You already lied
to the authorities once

01:32.658 --> 01:33.691
to protect your husband.

01:34.121 --> 01:35.288
We didn't know if we could trust you.

01:35.322 --> 01:36.989
<i>Trust me?</i>

01:37.131 --> 01:38.599
That's funny.

01:38.993 --> 01:42.676
This whole thing... [Sighs]

01:43.183 --> 01:45.417
Oh. [Scoffs] I... I don't believe this.

01:45.442 --> 01:47.033
I never meant for you to find out this way.

01:47.068 --> 01:48.845
- If you'd just let me explain...
- Explain what?

01:48.870 --> 01:51.560
That this whole thing was a lie?!

01:51.585 --> 01:54.537
Look, all that matters now
is where we go from here.

01:54.562 --> 01:56.283
All that matters to you, maybe.

01:57.311 --> 01:58.343
April.

02:06.392 --> 02:09.229
What about a receptionist for a P.R. firm?

02:09.255 --> 02:10.723
That might be interesting.

02:10.776 --> 02:13.278
Maybe, if they didn't
require a college degree.

02:13.303 --> 02:15.536
All the decent listings require a degree.

02:15.861 --> 02:18.095
How did the apartment hunting go yesterday?

02:18.120 --> 02:20.700
I went to a few. Nothing great.

02:21.131 --> 02:24.301
I saw some of them online.
Didn't look that bad.

02:25.017 --> 02:26.540
They're not.

02:27.404 --> 02:30.869
But with the security deposit
and the first month down,

02:31.043 --> 02:34.394
the fact is I don't have enough
money for anything decent,

02:34.419 --> 02:37.604
and I can't realistically
stay on your couch forever.

02:38.392 --> 02:41.663
[Sighs] It all feels like a huge dead end.

02:41.721 --> 02:43.653
I wish I could just go home.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.423
Anna, we discussed this.

02:45.457 --> 02:46.992
Your apartment isn't safe enough.

02:47.026 --> 02:49.106
I meant home to Korea.

02:49.694 --> 02:50.733
Oh.

02:51.931 --> 02:54.499
I didn't realize that was
something you were considering.

02:54.799 --> 02:58.921
It's not. I mean, how could I?

02:59.304 --> 03:00.861
That would mean telling my parents

03:00.886 --> 03:03.021
I've been lying to them for years.

03:03.415 --> 03:07.818
They think I'm married
and happy and successful.

03:08.491 --> 03:12.548
Maybe if you gave them a
chance, they might surprise you.

03:12.573 --> 03:14.640
Or they might reject me.

03:16.587 --> 03:17.855
Sorry. I'm sorry...

03:17.889 --> 03:19.356
- [Chuckles]
- [Laughs]

03:19.390 --> 03:21.119
For being such a pain in the ass.

03:21.144 --> 03:23.200
Seriously, I'm so grateful to you.

03:23.327 --> 03:26.796
No one's ever shown
this much interest in me.

03:26.830 --> 03:27.964
[Chuckles]

03:27.998 --> 03:31.535
[Chuckles]

03:36.440 --> 03:38.080
She's not here.

03:38.441 --> 03:39.862
Yeah, I can see that.

03:40.010 --> 03:41.510
I'm heading out to lunch.

03:41.545 --> 03:44.224
Do you... Need something from me?

03:45.054 --> 03:46.662
Just enjoying the view.

03:46.687 --> 03:47.988
[Chuckles]

03:48.013 --> 03:49.313
Got to say, you, uh...

03:50.518 --> 03:52.021
You look like a million bucks.

03:52.454 --> 03:53.887
[Cellphone ringing]

03:57.394 --> 03:58.694
Jim, hey.

03:58.728 --> 04:00.696
Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.

04:00.730 --> 04:02.423
Yeah, listen, I, um...

04:03.733 --> 04:06.368
I wanted to talk to you about
one of your former associates,

04:06.403 --> 04:08.204
Antonia Ruiz.

04:08.238 --> 04:11.111
Yeah, that's right. Toni.

04:12.202 --> 04:15.000
Are you sure it's over between you and Dom?

04:15.144 --> 04:18.603
It seemed like there was so
much good stuff between you.

04:18.981 --> 04:20.281
I know. I know.

04:20.315 --> 04:22.880
But all that got messed up along the way.

04:23.065 --> 04:25.024
And it seems like we tried,

04:25.049 --> 04:27.483
but there was just nowhere to go, you know?

04:28.479 --> 04:30.358
- I'm so sorry, sweetie.
- [Bell jingles]

04:30.392 --> 04:32.023
Guess who's getting married!

04:32.048 --> 04:34.282
And if you guessed me, you guessed right.

04:34.307 --> 04:35.589
- Oh, my God!
- Aah!

04:35.614 --> 04:38.003
- Married to who?
- [Gasps] What? To Scott.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.710
Who else would it be?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:39.735 --> 04:41.402
Savi, why are you wearing the
depressed ponytail in here?

04:41.437 --> 04:42.468
What were you two just talking about?

04:42.493 --> 04:45.025
Savi and Dom broke up. Have I met Scott?

04:45.050 --> 04:46.518
Ohh. No. Are you okay?

04:46.543 --> 04:48.177
- It's okay.
- We can be sad about that later.

04:48.202 --> 04:50.574
Right now, I just want to freak out

04:50.599 --> 04:52.415
because my baby sister is getting married!

04:52.440 --> 04:53.814
Aah! [Laughs]

04:53.849 --> 04:54.949
Let me see the ring.

04:54.983 --> 04:56.884
- [Both gasp]
- I need to get it sized

04:56.918 --> 04:59.220
- 'cause it keeps falling off.
- Honey, it's beautiful.

04:59.245 --> 05:00.336
It is, isn't it?

05:00.361 --> 05:01.428
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God!

05:01.453 --> 05:02.820
- [Laughs]
- [Bell jingles]

05:02.923 --> 05:05.492
This is crazy! I'm so excited!

05:05.816 --> 05:07.700
Joss just told us she's getting married!

05:07.725 --> 05:09.759
But Savi and Dom are broken up.

05:09.930 --> 05:11.823
Daniel's an FBI agent.

05:11.932 --> 05:13.924
He was using me to get to Paul.

05:16.444 --> 05:18.497
I'm never playing this game with her again.

05:35.105 --> 05:38.267
[Door closes] Hey. I have some big news.

05:38.292 --> 05:40.943
Yeah? So do I. Greta is psychotic.

05:41.655 --> 05:43.326
Oh, no. What happened?

05:43.351 --> 05:44.485
Look at this e-mail from her.

05:44.519 --> 05:46.420
We're three weeks out from the soft open.

05:46.454 --> 05:48.922
I was literally about to have
you send the menus to the printer.

05:48.956 --> 05:50.019
- Yeah?
- And she wants to throw out

05:50.019 --> 05:51.019
everything.

05:51.044 --> 05:53.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa. But she
already approved the menus.

05:53.345 --> 05:55.796
Exactly, and now she's not
sure it's ambitious enough.

05:55.821 --> 05:57.622
She's thinking... Ho ho ho, wait for it.

05:57.647 --> 05:58.961
- Huh?
- "Japanese-y."

05:58.961 --> 06:00.011
She literally used that word.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.837
And... and look at this. Only in L.A.

06:01.862 --> 06:05.481
Her psychic says "to avoid using
all white and purple vegetables

06:05.506 --> 06:08.474
- until at least the spring of 2015."
- Oh, well, okay.

06:08.509 --> 06:10.110
This is a lot of interesting information.

06:10.144 --> 06:11.607
There's nothing interesting about it, Joss.

06:11.632 --> 06:14.266
I'm not a short-order cook
for some whack-job model

06:14.291 --> 06:16.426
who doesn't know a lentil from a snap pea.

06:16.650 --> 06:19.017
You know what? I-I'd just rather
walk out before I get fired.

06:19.042 --> 06:21.121
Oh, my... Harry! Stop it.

06:21.221 --> 06:22.901
You're not gonna get fired, okay?

06:22.979 --> 06:25.157
You two just need to
sit down and talk it out.

06:25.182 --> 06:27.747
It's all a part of the process.
I've seen it a million times.

06:27.772 --> 06:29.561
Usually it's on some reality show.

06:29.595 --> 06:31.230
But I think... you think
that I'm being difficult?

06:31.264 --> 06:33.732
What?! Of course not.

06:33.766 --> 06:35.325
No, you're being you.

06:35.350 --> 06:36.945
You're an amazing chef. She's being Greta.

06:36.970 --> 06:38.569
She's difficult. What
do you want? I mean...

06:38.594 --> 06:40.032
But she needs you, Harry,

06:40.057 --> 06:42.391
<i>and I really need you.</i>

06:44.733 --> 06:46.819
- Fine.
- [Sighs] Thank you.

06:46.988 --> 06:49.323
Okay, now come here. Breathe.

06:49.348 --> 06:52.805
Let's just see what she's
really even asking us, okay?

06:53.619 --> 06:54.753
Sensible people.

06:54.787 --> 06:55.821
[Groans]

06:55.855 --> 06:57.823
Look, chiquino peppers
are so hot right now.

06:57.857 --> 06:59.324
- What's your big news?
- Hmm?

06:59.359 --> 07:00.694
Your big news.

07:00.950 --> 07:02.338
Oh! Oh.

07:02.363 --> 07:04.832
- You know what?
- I don't even remember anymore.

07:04.857 --> 07:06.324
Let's talk menu.

07:06.349 --> 07:08.818
Uh, "without any evil
white or purple vegetables."

07:08.843 --> 07:10.616
- What does that even... ?
- [Scoffs]

07:15.750 --> 07:17.218
You got a minute?

07:20.768 --> 07:22.451
It's about Toni.

07:22.748 --> 07:24.373
Take it to H.R.

07:24.398 --> 07:26.805
Look, I spoke to Jim
Fletcher, one of the partners

07:26.830 --> 07:28.451
at the last firm Toni worked for.

07:28.476 --> 07:30.843
I wanted to find out why Toni
left there after just a year.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.299
You know what he said?

07:32.777 --> 07:34.612
He said he didn't want to get into it,

07:34.637 --> 07:36.437
which means he couldn't get into it.

07:36.462 --> 07:38.167
I'm guessing something happened there, too.

07:38.192 --> 07:40.175
I don't know. And I don't care.

07:40.231 --> 07:41.926
What I do know is that you had sex with

07:41.951 --> 07:43.433
two associates at this firm.

07:43.467 --> 07:44.954
And if I were you,

07:44.979 --> 07:47.070
I'd be mighty grateful
that I still had a job here.

07:47.138 --> 07:48.601
- Mitchell.
- Keep your head down.

07:48.626 --> 07:51.261
Do your work. Stay away
from both of those women.

07:51.642 --> 07:52.742
Understand?

07:59.417 --> 08:02.051
[Sighs]

08:02.085 --> 08:05.170
What do you think... tie or... or no tie?

08:07.257 --> 08:09.058
You know, it would be a lot easier to help

08:09.092 --> 08:11.060
if I knew what this interview's about.

08:11.094 --> 08:13.332
Oh, I'm not... not telling.
Don't want to jinx it.

08:13.357 --> 08:15.158
You're nervous, aren't you?

08:15.289 --> 08:18.424
I haven't had a job
interview in over 10 years.

08:18.701 --> 08:21.170
- I'm not used to winning people over.
- [Chuckles]

08:21.204 --> 08:26.000
Really? You won me over the
first five minutes I met you.

08:26.774 --> 08:29.075
You have a natural way
of putting people at ease.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.542
That's why you're such a good therapist.

08:36.022 --> 08:38.486
I love when you do that.

08:38.520 --> 08:41.155
Hey, you, uh... You busy tonight?

08:41.190 --> 08:44.662
Dinner, movie, maybe... My place?

08:44.687 --> 08:49.649
I wish I could, but, um, I
can't leave Anna that long.

08:49.698 --> 08:51.511
Uh, definitely not overnight.

08:51.536 --> 08:54.605
You mean Anna your... your new roommate?

08:54.971 --> 08:56.821
I know. I know.

08:57.071 --> 08:59.606
But at this point, all
I want to do is help her.

08:59.875 --> 09:02.510
So, Anna told me she wants
to go back home to Korea,

09:02.544 --> 09:05.179
but she's afraid of how
her parents will react.

09:05.213 --> 09:07.515
I keep thinking of how
I'd tell her to handle it

09:07.549 --> 09:09.203
if we were still in session.

09:09.384 --> 09:11.508
But you're not in session anymore.

09:11.533 --> 09:13.000
I mean, for better or worse,

09:13.025 --> 09:15.166
your relationship's completely changed.

09:16.310 --> 09:19.158
Maybe you should think about
what you'd say to her as a friend.

09:26.167 --> 09:29.303
I've already started to call some venues,

09:29.337 --> 09:31.972
and shutters can see
you as early as Friday,

09:32.006 --> 09:33.640
if you want to go beachy
with the whole thing.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.876
God, you're officially gonna take
over this wedding, aren't you?

09:35.910 --> 09:37.544
Oh, yeah, just sit back

09:37.578 --> 09:41.047
and let my organizational
skills wash all over you.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.348
- [Laughs]
- Excuse me.

09:43.951 --> 09:44.985
Oh, thanks.

09:49.298 --> 09:50.974
Dude, that's not my car.

09:50.999 --> 09:52.900
[Chuckles]

09:54.290 --> 09:55.872
What is this?

09:55.897 --> 09:57.864
- "Joss, I can't wait to marry you."
- [Gasps]

09:57.889 --> 10:00.400
"You drive me insane. Drive safe.
Precious cargo. Love, Scott."

10:00.434 --> 10:01.552
What?

10:01.577 --> 10:03.513
Wait, wait, he bought...
he bought you this car?

10:03.537 --> 10:05.504
Oh, my God, he bought you this car?!

10:05.539 --> 10:06.877
Where's my car?

10:06.902 --> 10:08.737
Your fiancé drove it back home.

10:08.762 --> 10:10.162
Savi: Oh, my God!

10:17.699 --> 10:21.434
This is like being in the
cockpit of a private plane.

10:21.718 --> 10:23.009
[Sighs]

10:23.034 --> 10:24.802
You never told me Scott was loaded.

10:24.827 --> 10:26.518
Well, I never really thought about it.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.860
I guess we do go to nice restaurants,

10:28.894 --> 10:30.262
and his place is really great.

10:30.296 --> 10:33.088
Okay, you're the designated
driver from now on, okay?

10:35.468 --> 10:36.935
What's wrong?

10:36.969 --> 10:38.436
Hmm? Hmm?

10:38.470 --> 10:40.099
Oh, uh...

10:40.639 --> 10:43.441
Nothing, I just... I can't
believe this is my car.

10:43.475 --> 10:45.777
- [Laughs] Believe it.
- Hmm.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.018
Let's drive.

10:47.043 --> 10:49.512
[Laughing] Okay, Thelma. Calm down.

10:49.537 --> 10:51.991
Let me see if I can figure this sucker out.

10:52.952 --> 10:55.682
I mean... I think it's that thing.

10:55.707 --> 10:56.943
[Knock on door]

10:58.976 --> 11:00.757
All you have to do is hear me out.

11:08.276 --> 11:09.620
Are you even married?

11:09.934 --> 11:11.735
[Sighs] No.

11:11.769 --> 11:13.847
[Scoffs] Of course you're not.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.174
Even that was a lie. Everything was...

11:16.199 --> 11:17.661
No, not everything.

11:17.686 --> 11:19.517
- Oh, don't you dare.
- No, I loved you.

11:19.542 --> 11:20.666
I still love you.

11:20.691 --> 11:23.154
<i>No, you loved getting
information out of me.</i>

11:23.180 --> 11:24.447
It wasn't like that!

11:24.482 --> 11:26.116
Okay, yeah, I was sent to that art show

11:26.150 --> 11:27.783
to... to meet you and forge a relationship,

11:27.818 --> 11:29.700
but it... it was never
supposed to become...

11:29.778 --> 11:31.568
What? Sexual?

11:31.593 --> 11:34.262
[Sighs] I know I crossed the line.

11:36.054 --> 11:37.627
Were you supposed to get my little girl

11:37.661 --> 11:39.129
to fall in love with you, too?

11:39.163 --> 11:42.696
Don't say that. You know
how I feel about Lucy.

11:42.821 --> 11:44.299
Look, we'd been tracking Paul

11:44.334 --> 11:45.868
for over a year before we met, okay?

11:45.902 --> 11:48.037
And there were so many times
that I wanted to tell you.

11:48.071 --> 11:49.371
But you didn't!

11:49.405 --> 11:52.008
Because your job was so
much more important than me!

11:52.042 --> 11:54.935
No, it wasn't the job,
okay? It was the case.

11:55.378 --> 11:57.113
And I've been working on
it since the beginning,

11:57.147 --> 11:58.848
and there are some
serious criminals involved.

11:58.882 --> 12:01.016
And they're hurting good people every day.

12:01.050 --> 12:02.518
Look, it really doesn't matter.

12:02.552 --> 12:05.548
I don't care, and I'm
not doing this anymore.

12:05.821 --> 12:07.789
So you can tell agent Thomas I'm out.

12:07.823 --> 12:10.392
Find another way to get to Paul.

12:11.133 --> 12:13.028
It's not that simple.

12:13.062 --> 12:14.382
<i>It is that simple!</i>

12:14.664 --> 12:16.397
[Sighs]

12:16.431 --> 12:17.732
[Sighs]

12:17.767 --> 12:19.840
Now, can you please just leave my house

12:19.865 --> 12:21.699
and never come back?

12:23.222 --> 12:25.490
<i>Never come back, Daniel.</i>

12:29.683 --> 12:30.912
[Door opens]

12:32.439 --> 12:33.839
[Door closes]

12:50.304 --> 12:52.471
[Cellphone ringing]

12:54.500 --> 12:55.967
Zack. Hi.

12:56.001 --> 12:57.757
Savi, hey, I'm glad you picked up.

12:57.782 --> 12:59.824
Uh, did you ever get my message?

12:59.910 --> 13:00.915
I did.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.856
I was gonna call you back,

13:03.196 --> 13:05.164
and then I was gonna e-mail you back.

13:05.277 --> 13:08.624
And then I just chickened out completely.

13:09.753 --> 13:12.968
I just... I wasn't sure if you
were still mad at me or not.

13:13.118 --> 13:15.375
Oh, I was... I was never mad at you.

13:15.487 --> 13:19.364
So, uh, do you think we should
go back to being friends?

13:19.841 --> 13:21.736
Yeah. I'd like that.

13:22.627 --> 13:26.096
Hey, uh, before I forget,
did you ever wind up moving?

13:26.130 --> 13:30.033
No, I decided to keep my house. Why?

13:30.068 --> 13:32.169
So your address is still the same?

13:32.203 --> 13:34.647
Uh, yeah, h-ho... hold on one second.

13:34.784 --> 13:36.225
What is this?

13:36.670 --> 13:38.771
They just asked me to get your signatures.

13:43.714 --> 13:45.849
Uh, Zack, can I call you back?

13:45.883 --> 13:47.150
I'm at work right now.

13:47.185 --> 13:48.775
Yeah, no problem. We'll talk soon.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.290
Okay. Bye.

13:54.713 --> 13:57.035
Great. Coordinate with Davis.
He needs to be on the call.

13:57.060 --> 13:59.696
- Dom, can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh, not really.

13:59.730 --> 14:01.972
I just noticed I was taken
off the Breitling case.

14:01.997 --> 14:03.343
Yeah, well, you're gonna have
to take it up with Mitchell.

14:03.368 --> 14:04.734
Well, I'd rather take it up with you,

14:04.759 --> 14:06.711
<i>since you were there when
I was put on the case.</i>

14:06.736 --> 14:07.970
- [Sighs]
- Wait a minute.

14:08.005 --> 14:10.106
Are you seriously walking
away from me right now?

14:10.140 --> 14:12.975
I said take it up with Mitchell.
There's nothing more I can do.

14:13.010 --> 14:14.243
Look, I-I'm sorry, but I cannot be having

14:14.277 --> 14:16.057
this conversation with you right now.

14:16.082 --> 14:18.047
- Mitchell was very specific about us not...
- But...

14:18.072 --> 14:20.040
I don't want to be having this
conversation, either, okay?

14:20.065 --> 14:22.298
I really think we could
both use a little space.

14:22.323 --> 14:24.625
- Savi, I don't...
- But this is my job,

14:24.650 --> 14:27.145
and you can't just screw
me over on stuff like this

14:27.170 --> 14:28.419
just because you're mad at me.

14:28.444 --> 14:30.728
I'm the one who got you on
this case in the first place.

14:30.753 --> 14:32.656
So do me a favor... Stop complaining,

14:32.681 --> 14:34.648
or feel free to find a job someplace else.

14:44.076 --> 14:46.577
[Indistinct whispering]

14:54.319 --> 14:55.486
I'm seriously so embarrassed

14:55.520 --> 14:57.141
that I'm even bothering
you with any of this

14:57.166 --> 14:58.567
considering everything you're
going through with Daniel.

14:58.592 --> 15:00.271
- No, Daniel is over.
- [Sighs]

15:00.296 --> 15:02.708
And besides, I am so
happy for the distraction.

15:02.959 --> 15:04.760
So, what's the problem, okay?

15:04.785 --> 15:06.052
You had a fight with Scott?

15:06.447 --> 15:08.056
[Whimpers, sighs]

15:08.081 --> 15:09.186
Okay.

15:11.266 --> 15:12.967
He bought me a Tesla.

15:13.001 --> 15:14.801
I think we have different definitions

15:14.836 --> 15:15.857
of the word "problem."

15:15.882 --> 15:18.181
April, do you remember how excited I was

15:18.206 --> 15:19.306
when I bought my coupe?

15:19.341 --> 15:20.441
I saved every penny

15:20.475 --> 15:22.409
and I bargained my sweet little ass off

15:22.444 --> 15:24.344
to get the best deal
and it's finally paid off

15:24.518 --> 15:27.189
and it's cute and it's
dented and it sputters.

15:27.214 --> 15:29.039
But it's mine, and I love it.

15:29.122 --> 15:31.257
I could never, in a million
years, afford that Tesla.

15:31.385 --> 15:33.520
So Scott is making you pay
the payments on the car?

15:33.554 --> 15:35.698
No! That's the worst part.

15:35.723 --> 15:37.199
It's a gift... the gift of dependency.

15:37.224 --> 15:38.904
And you want to know the worst, worst part?

15:38.929 --> 15:40.202
I'm already getting used to it.

15:40.227 --> 15:42.228
What... it's okay to get
used to his lifestyle.

15:42.262 --> 15:44.130
You're marrying him. What's his is yours.

15:44.164 --> 15:45.631
[Sighs]

15:45.665 --> 15:46.866
Do you know what I always thought

15:46.900 --> 15:48.868
would be the hardest
part about marriage, hmm?

15:48.902 --> 15:50.136
Monogamy.

15:50.170 --> 15:52.438
- But you know what?
- I could sleep with only Scott

15:52.473 --> 15:54.573
for the rest of my life
and be totally fine.

15:54.608 --> 15:58.311
It's stuff like this crazy
Tesla thing that freaks me out.

15:58.345 --> 16:00.141
I've been a kept woman, April.

16:00.166 --> 16:02.700
- I can't do it again.
- Ah.

16:03.082 --> 16:06.184
Joss, this is not the same
as being someone's mistress.

16:06.219 --> 16:08.558
- Isn't it?!
- What kind of gift is that?!

16:08.583 --> 16:11.328
It completely throws the whole
balance of power out of whack!

16:11.388 --> 16:13.489
How am I ever supposed to get mad at him

16:13.514 --> 16:15.215
when he can hold a Tesla over my head?

16:15.423 --> 16:18.140
April, I've spent the last year
trying to get my life together,

16:18.165 --> 16:19.865
and I am finally the independent woman

16:19.890 --> 16:21.557
that Destiny's Child wanted me to be.

16:21.696 --> 16:23.162
- [Laughs]
- So tell me this...

16:23.197 --> 16:25.832
what if marrying Scott
changes all that, hmm?

16:27.024 --> 16:29.692
You're not considering calling
off the engagement, are you?

16:29.717 --> 16:32.520
I don't know. I don't want to lose Scott.

16:32.555 --> 16:34.336
But I don't want to lose myself.

16:36.289 --> 16:37.792
Hmm.

16:40.447 --> 16:42.000
I'm gonna ask my boss

16:42.025 --> 16:43.826
about picking up more shifts at the diner

16:43.851 --> 16:45.472
so I'm not in your hair so much.

16:45.497 --> 16:47.664
You're not in my hair at all.

16:51.448 --> 16:54.892
I was actually hoping we could
discuss this idea of yours

16:54.917 --> 16:57.348
about going back to Korea a little more.

16:57.410 --> 16:59.377
Ugh, I never should have brought that up.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.897
I'm glad you did.

17:00.922 --> 17:02.991
It gave me a lot to think about.

17:04.833 --> 17:07.367
Do you know why I wanted
to become a psychiatrist?

17:07.839 --> 17:10.541
You had a temporary lapse in sanity?

17:10.576 --> 17:12.544
No. [Chuckles]

17:12.578 --> 17:14.276
It was because of my parents.

17:14.965 --> 17:16.666
They wanted you to be a doctor.

17:16.692 --> 17:18.892
Or a lawyer. As long as it was successful.

17:18.916 --> 17:20.683
That's all that mattered to my mother.

17:20.752 --> 17:22.837
I felt like she was
always hovering around me,

17:22.862 --> 17:26.319
always pushing me, but never seeing me.

17:26.701 --> 17:29.670
Most of the time, I was lonely.

17:32.264 --> 17:35.930
As I was growing up, I
wanted to connect with people.

17:35.955 --> 17:39.079
I wanted to be meaningful in a way

17:39.104 --> 17:41.279
that I didn't feel with my own family.

17:42.207 --> 17:44.575
And I thought becoming a psychiatrist

17:44.609 --> 17:46.093
would help me achieve that.

17:46.118 --> 17:49.246
So I applied to every
school on the west coast.

17:49.348 --> 17:52.927
I wanted to get as far
away as I could. [Chuckles]

17:53.047 --> 17:54.781
And you got into Stanford.

17:54.806 --> 17:56.973
Oh, my mother was over the moon.

17:57.321 --> 17:58.856
It never occurred to her

17:58.890 --> 18:01.745
that she wouldn't be seeing
me more than once a year.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.280
But we didn't have much money,

18:04.305 --> 18:07.146
and flights to New York
were very expensive.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.544
As time went on,

18:09.992 --> 18:12.471
I wound up visiting less and less.

18:13.105 --> 18:17.046
I kept thinking to myself,
"I'll go next Christmas.

18:17.492 --> 18:19.392
I'll go next summer."

18:19.810 --> 18:22.684
Then one day, I got a call from my father

18:22.709 --> 18:25.711
that my... mother had passed away.

18:28.419 --> 18:29.537
[Chuckles]

18:29.893 --> 18:32.462
I'd finally become this successful woman

18:32.487 --> 18:34.455
she'd always wanted me to be,

18:34.608 --> 18:37.443
and she never got a chance to see it.

18:41.043 --> 18:44.365
[Voice breaking] And I never
got a chance to say goodbye.

18:45.235 --> 18:47.564
Why didn't you tell me any of this before?

18:47.904 --> 18:50.881
Well, our sessions were about you.

18:51.984 --> 18:53.764
But we're friends now.

18:54.244 --> 18:59.123
As my friend, I wanted you to know this

19:00.156 --> 19:03.032
because I don't want the
same to happen to you.

19:11.527 --> 19:14.029
Always fireworks with you two, huh?

19:15.404 --> 19:17.205
Should I leave you alone for a minute?

19:17.317 --> 19:19.091
Uh, no.

19:19.257 --> 19:22.125
No, it's fine. I'm... I'm okay. Thank you.

19:22.573 --> 19:23.874
Look, it's none of my business,

19:23.899 --> 19:26.200
but if I were you, I would
be reporting that crap.

19:26.225 --> 19:28.359
Yeah, you're right... it
is none of your business.

19:28.384 --> 19:32.020
He just humiliated you in
front of the entire office.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.746
Everyone knows you were screwing.

19:33.779 --> 19:36.427
Sounds like a hostile
work environment to me.

19:36.649 --> 19:38.302
Filing a fake harassment suit

19:38.327 --> 19:39.963
doesn't get you anywhere, okay?

19:39.988 --> 19:41.509
It's not gonna give me a leg up,

19:41.534 --> 19:43.708
and it's certainly not
gonna help me make partner.

19:43.845 --> 19:44.978
You know why?

19:45.028 --> 19:47.781
Because that's not how a
boys' club actually works.

19:49.309 --> 19:52.255
There are easier ways to make money.

19:52.922 --> 19:54.516
All you have to say is Dom made you

19:54.535 --> 19:57.268
feel uncomfortable after your
sexual relationship ended.

19:57.293 --> 19:59.728
Yeah, but he didn't make
me feel uncomfortable.

20:00.108 --> 20:02.375
Me, either, but that doesn't matter.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.044
All you have to do is
establish a pattern of behavior.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.454

what he's gonna do yet?

- Ohh, honey.
- I'm so happy for her,

She changed mine.

32:39.284 --> 32:41.692

of my profession to do it,

32:45.857 --> 32:47.888
which made me realize...

32:48.359 --> 32:50.927
I don't think this is the
right profession for me,

32:50.961 --> 32:52.095
not anymore.

32:52.129 --> 32:54.464
So I decided to quit.

32:55.065 --> 32:56.933
- What?
- What do you mean, "quit"?

32:56.967 --> 32:59.502
I mean, I'm not gonna be
a psychiatrist anymore.

32:59.536 --> 33:01.704

33:01.738 --> 33:03.482
I honestly have no idea.

33:04.241 --> 33:07.725

move to Boston with him.

- What?!
- Boston?!

33:15.485 --> 33:17.319

33:17.353 --> 33:19.228
Actually, we have been dating.
