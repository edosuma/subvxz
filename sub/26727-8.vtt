WEBVTT

01:40.350 --> 01:41.643
Complete transformation?

01:42.227 --> 01:43.520
Even though he hasn't had any blood?

01:46.397 --> 01:47.732
I have to get Tsukasa...

01:48.566 --> 01:49.442
He dodged me?

01:50.777 --> 01:51.778
Hey!

01:51.861 --> 01:56.324
Didn't you ask me to take Tsukasa
when you transform?

01:56.825 --> 01:59.577
Hurry and hand her over!
I'll take her to the hospital!

01:59.911 --> 02:01.329
Are you listening to me, Anzai?

02:02.831 --> 02:04.874
Mr. Anzai.

02:05.208 --> 02:10.463
What? Wasn't I just shot in the stomach?

02:13.007 --> 02:15.343
This stopped the bullet.

02:17.011 --> 02:18.596
This managed to block it!

02:19.347 --> 02:22.809
Zero-Seven, the sniper, gave this to me.

02:23.351 --> 02:24.477
I have to thank her...

02:27.730 --> 02:30.650
Even though he has transformed,
he managed to stay conscious.

02:31.192 --> 02:35.530
If he gets proper training,
he will be able to control himself.

02:36.614 --> 02:37.699
Permission to fire?

02:38.116 --> 02:40.326
Granted. I'm counting on you, Zero-Six.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.791
I recognize that face. Makimura?

02:53.631 --> 02:58.052
If only all vampire and human couples
were like you two.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.557
Did she say something?

03:03.558 --> 03:05.810
Our work here is done.
Time to go, Zero-Nine.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.562
Are you okay?

03:08.146 --> 03:09.439
My injury? It's nothing.

03:09.689 --> 03:10.773
Not that!

03:11.316 --> 03:14.611
That's the first time you shot
a human, right? Are you okay?

03:16.362 --> 03:18.114
I'm not sad.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.950
It wasn't very different
from killing a vampire.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.952
Really? All right, then.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.997
Sniping means I'm far away, after all.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.377
Tsukasa, do you always
inject him with sedatives?

03:31.753 --> 03:33.129
This is only the second time.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.757
But it's better that I know how to do it.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.259
I reported it.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.721
There were gunmen
on two different rooftops.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.683
But I didn't mention Ushio.
It's better that I didn't, right?

03:46.559 --> 03:48.561
Someone else should get him.

03:48.853 --> 03:51.105
-I'll ask Sawazaki.
-Okay.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.148
Tsukasa.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.107
Oh, yes?

03:53.441 --> 03:55.026
There's something I want to tell you.

03:56.069 --> 03:56.945
Do you want to talk?

03:58.988 --> 04:00.823
Hey! Hold on.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.951
-A foreigner?
-His Japanese is so good!

04:03.493 --> 04:05.745
A doctor friend of Yanagi told me,

04:06.621 --> 04:10.375
"For a vampire to be able to control
himself, he must first know himself."

04:10.917 --> 04:15.922
He said it's important for me to know
when and exactly how much I'll transform.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.969
Honestly, I didn't agree.

04:21.970 --> 04:26.140
In order to protect you,
I thought I needed to stay away,

04:26.557 --> 04:29.102
since you're usually involved
when I transform.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.355
If I try to learn more
about my transformations,

04:32.814 --> 04:34.983
you'll somehow be involved.

04:36.025 --> 04:38.403
It would mean exposing you to more danger.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.447
I thought I couldn't let that happen.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.202
I never really told you this.

04:48.830 --> 04:52.458
What happened was the same
as when you saved me at the college.

04:54.043 --> 04:57.880
Even when I was bleeding,
you still rescued me, right?

04:58.506 --> 05:01.592
I could have been shot earlier
and bled a lot,

05:02.343 --> 05:04.178
but you rescued me anyway. I'm so happy.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.888
I missed you.

05:08.391 --> 05:12.645
Would you still say the same thing
if I went crazy and bit you?

05:13.521 --> 05:15.815
It wouldn't be just a bite.
Vampires drink blood,

05:16.024 --> 05:17.859
and worse...

05:18.693 --> 05:21.529
I think Lee would stop you
before it came to that.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.949
Isn't that why you two came together?

05:25.366 --> 05:27.577
Just in case something happens.

05:28.411 --> 05:32.665
Don't worry.
I won't die from just one or two bites.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.252
It hurts, you know. Being bitten.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.797
Was she always this trusting?

05:40.173 --> 05:46.304
Physical pain doesn't hurt that much,
compared to not being with you.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.017
I see. It's not that she's naive.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.436
She's just honest.

05:54.020 --> 05:57.023
Maybe I am just being selfish.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.026
I'm sorry! This must be hard for you.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.278
She never lies.

06:03.654 --> 06:07.075
Doesn't it disgust you
when you look at my face?

06:07.158 --> 06:08.493
What? Why?

06:09.452 --> 06:11.287
Did someone tell you that?

06:11.913 --> 06:15.208
Don't listen to cruel words like that!

06:15.833 --> 06:16.834
It was me.

06:18.252 --> 06:21.923
I'm the one disgusted with myself.

06:23.424 --> 06:26.677
And that's normal.
You're the one who's different.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.430
I think it's dangerous for us
to be together,

06:29.764 --> 06:33.351
but it would be dangerous
to leave you on your own, too.

06:34.435 --> 06:36.312
The doctor told me that.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.733
There are ways to control your bloodlust.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.445
But for that, you'll need
your girlfriend's help.

06:46.322 --> 06:49.659
I don't know what it takes
to control a vampire,

06:50.076 --> 06:52.495
I'm still not really sure, but...

06:56.040 --> 06:58.417
Let's stay together.

07:01.796 --> 07:02.630
Yes, you're right.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.716
Bye! Thank you!

07:08.970 --> 07:10.721
Oh, well...

07:13.224 --> 07:14.225
Actually, never mind!

07:15.017 --> 07:16.936
What is it? I'm curious.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.729
No, it's...

07:19.230 --> 07:20.398
Come on. Tell me.

07:21.482 --> 07:25.570
Are we dating now?

07:26.320 --> 07:28.239
What? Seriously?

07:30.158 --> 07:31.075
You're laugh--

07:31.159 --> 07:32.827
Dating?

07:37.832 --> 07:41.461
We never talked
about the important stuff before.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.129
Will you go out with me?

07:45.548 --> 07:47.383
Yes, I will.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.219
Then please take care of me.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.762
Likewise.

07:55.057 --> 07:57.685
Oh, do you mind if I just...

08:01.564 --> 08:04.984
The sedative hasn't worn off yet,
so I don't think I'll transform.

08:06.194 --> 08:10.615
Anzai is a quiet one, isn't he?
Tsukasa, you better watch out!

08:10.740 --> 08:12.158
OVERNIGHT EMERGENCY ENTRANCE

08:14.035 --> 08:15.828
Is that right?

08:16.954 --> 08:17.872
I'm sorry.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.916
The manager of Bar Cross,

08:20.374 --> 08:23.503
Kiwako Oe, and her employee, Wataru Akase,

08:23.586 --> 08:24.754
both dead.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.632
Ryunosuke Katagiri is suspected of hiding,

08:28.299 --> 08:30.259
but he won't be able to move
in the near future.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.470
Two are dead because of him.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.472
That should be enough warning.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.184
Squad C, Ushio, private line.
Status report.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.729
Zero-Seven and Zero-Nine
appear to have escaped Mino Hotel.

08:42.897 --> 08:46.400
Workers who inspected the rooftop
water tank had their clothes stolen

08:46.901 --> 08:48.444
and were left tied up on the roof.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.071
What about the hostage?

08:50.488 --> 08:51.322
Unknown.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.866
A vampire showed up and took her.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.786
According to Zero-Six,
it was Anzai, from Squad F.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.579
So, it was him?

08:58.829 --> 08:59.747
How should we proceed?

09:00.164 --> 09:02.542
Apparently, a tip came in from someone
with a young man's voice.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.921
He said there were snipers on the roofs
of the Mino Hotel and the Grand Hotel.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.968
The blood on the roof will reveal
that Makimura was there,

09:12.552 --> 09:15.972
but there was no tip revealing
that you're a spy.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.181
Why?

09:17.640 --> 09:18.474
Who knows?

09:18.599 --> 09:21.269
But Anzai is a junior officer.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.854
He might not have been able
to decide on his own.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.816
Monitor Squad F's movement.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.109
Got it.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.528
Can you determine
the hostage's background?

09:31.070 --> 09:32.071
I'll look into it.

09:32.446 --> 09:33.406
And this is just a hunch,

09:33.906 --> 09:36.242
but I think the hostage and Anzai
are romantically involved.

09:38.411 --> 09:42.999
So he fell in love with a human,
just like his father did.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.793
Aside from his hair, he is just like him.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.589
If he follows the path his father took,
it'll be tragic.

09:50.214 --> 09:52.883
A half-breed with a mass murderer
for a father.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.845
You just keep getting more
and more interesting,

09:56.262 --> 09:58.180
Yuki Anzai.

10:00.224 --> 10:03.477
Once I move to the bar,
we'll be able to see each other every day.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.313
I guess so.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.608
What a mess.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.985
The repairmen will be coming next month.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.236
Next month?

10:13.070 --> 10:14.697
Make sure to bring your valuables.

10:15.072 --> 10:17.033
This place isn't safe anymore.

10:18.659 --> 10:19.827
You can take that, you know.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.416
I guess we won't be back here for a while.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.003
Once things calm down,
I hope we can relax at the kotatsu again.

10:31.505 --> 10:32.632
Someone's suspicious out there.

10:33.132 --> 10:36.052
He's not with the police.
It's an amateur spy.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.137
It could be a reporter
or just someone curious,

10:38.304 --> 10:39.805
looking to catch a glimpse of Ms. Taira.

10:40.097 --> 10:42.933
Many people saw Ms. Taira
at the Ikebukuro incident.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.519
People are leaking her name
and where she's studying online.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.437
TSUKASA TAIRA?

10:46.729 --> 10:47.855
Oh, no.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.565
This is unrelated,

10:49.774 --> 10:53.444
but there's a rumor that a group
was set up to take out the vampires.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.237
What the heck?

10:55.571 --> 10:57.406
The group's name is CCC.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.408
"Chosen Civil Community."

10:59.950 --> 11:02.078
A community of chosen civilians.

11:02.912 --> 11:03.996
Sounds shady.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.458
Groups like this appeared
after the Ikebukuro incident,

11:07.708 --> 11:10.044
I can believe it, but...

11:10.544 --> 11:13.714
It's a bit early for them
to pop up, right?

11:13.881 --> 11:14.965
That's right.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.050
Excuse us.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.469
Oh, you two made it!

11:18.969 --> 11:21.389
Let's start the bloodlust training.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.558
The two of you will be in guest room A.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.645
Yanagi and I will be in room B next door.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.731
I've brought along some restraints.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.109
They're all designed
especially for vampires.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.194
So, what exactly are we doing?

11:35.611 --> 11:37.029
You'll be getting hot and heavy.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.032
And then you'll transform.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.577
Wait! Isn't this a training
to control my transformation?

11:44.495 --> 11:47.164
You need to know the timing
of your transformation to control it.

11:47.248 --> 11:51.085
Then you need to try and control yourself
once you've transformed.

11:51.377 --> 11:55.089
Restraint doesn't mean isolating yourself.
It needs control.

11:55.423 --> 11:59.969
Stop dating women
if you only want to stop your bloodlust.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.887
Don't worry.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.806
That's why I brought these.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.558
Help yourself.

12:06.016 --> 12:09.228
I'll be watching you live from room B.

12:09.645 --> 12:11.105
Yanagi, can you hear me?

12:12.273 --> 12:13.649
Loud and clear.

12:13.941 --> 12:14.900
What the heck?

12:15.317 --> 12:17.653
Don't we only need a doctor around
if we're doing it?

12:17.820 --> 12:21.991
It's just easier to communicate
between rooms A and B.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.659
It'll be off the whole time.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.579
Besides, you might end up
wanting to do it anyway.

12:26.954 --> 12:27.913
Shut up!

12:28.080 --> 12:32.293
Anyway, I'll be in room B with Yanagi,
measuring your body temperature.

12:32.543 --> 12:35.713
When your body temperature exceeds
the baseline level after transforming,

12:35.796 --> 12:39.467
we'll open the channel and address you.

12:39.675 --> 12:42.303
We'll ask you if you're hurt,
among other things.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.722
Make sure you answer.

12:44.972 --> 12:48.100
If you don't,
we'll open the video feed on our end.

12:52.271 --> 12:55.232
This is really offline, right?

12:55.691 --> 12:58.861
If it isn't, that doctor
has some serious issues.

13:00.112 --> 13:03.782
Maybe it is! The mic and camera
are both crossed out.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.160
Then, it's probably all...

13:08.621 --> 13:09.622
Mr. Anzai?

13:12.374 --> 13:13.709
Don't force yourself.

13:15.503 --> 13:16.795
Do you want to relax for a bit?

13:17.588 --> 13:19.215
No, I'm okay.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.050
Should we try these on?

13:26.013 --> 13:29.808
"It will protect your nails
once they've grown to their full size."

13:30.476 --> 13:32.770
These are handcuffs? They're heavy.

13:37.608 --> 13:40.152
Should we take them off now?
They're a bit in the way.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.197
No, let's keep them on.
Better safe than sorry.

13:43.572 --> 13:44.406
Really?

13:44.532 --> 13:46.784
We can hide them, like this.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.161
That's even worse!

13:49.245 --> 13:50.120
That hurts!

13:50.955 --> 13:53.666
Oh, sorry! I hit you right where
you were shot, didn't I?

13:53.999 --> 13:56.835
Oh, it's already healed.

13:58.045 --> 13:58.879
Look.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.716
-What's wrong?
-Oh, well...

14:05.261 --> 14:06.470
Does it hurt?

14:06.887 --> 14:10.099
Not anymore, but it feels a little tight.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.936
Sorry, it's just natural to touch...

14:14.728 --> 14:16.188
Go ahead. I don't mind.

14:20.734 --> 14:21.902
You smell good.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.160
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.122
Sorry for shrieking like that.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.257
Do you want to touch?

14:47.678 --> 14:49.054
His pulse has slightly...

14:49.138 --> 14:51.181
His body temperature
has risen a degree, too.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.482
I'm sorry. Didn't you like that?

15:00.941 --> 15:01.775
No, I did.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.611
Don't worry. Just stay...

15:06.655 --> 15:07.489
It started moving.

15:07.698 --> 15:08.824
What's his baseline temperature?

15:09.074 --> 15:12.286
He still has four degrees until he reaches
the average temperature

15:12.870 --> 15:13.954
during transformation.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.212
You can take off my bra.

15:24.798 --> 15:25.758
Three degrees.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.676
Calm down.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.346
Touch me down there.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.640
Two. One.

15:37.895 --> 15:41.565
Your temperature has exceeded
its normal range. Time for the questions.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.275
Any injuries to report?

15:45.444 --> 15:46.779
No.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.990
Didn't he hear him?

15:50.658 --> 15:53.285
If he doesn't answer soon,
the video feed will...

15:55.287 --> 15:56.789
Anzai, any injuries?

15:57.039 --> 15:57.873
No.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.544
For safety reasons, I'll be turning on
the video feed. You have a minute.

16:03.712 --> 16:04.546
Understood.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.051
Sorry for not stopping right away.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.680
So, he did hear him.

16:13.097 --> 16:16.934
Once you calm down,
we have more questions.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.228
I'm going to cool off outside
for a minute.

16:24.900 --> 16:29.488
His voice was so cute
when I touched his nipple.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.490
I hope I can hear it again.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.994
When I pushed her down...

16:35.703 --> 16:37.913
When we were lying there,
our bodies pressed together,

16:38.539 --> 16:41.875
I definitely heard a faint sound.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.923
She was wet. She wanted me.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.262
I want to hold her.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.556
To touch her.

16:55.848 --> 16:56.682
To put it in her.

16:56.890 --> 16:57.808
To move in her.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.226
To lick her.

16:59.727 --> 17:00.561
To be in her.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.187
To suck her.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.737
To suck her?

17:10.362 --> 17:14.366
We may need to consider getting
a new leader for Public Security Squad F.

17:14.950 --> 17:18.996
He tends to overlook cases
when agents are told to standby.

17:19.496 --> 17:20.330
Squad F.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.041
Sawazaki, right?

17:22.833 --> 17:23.667
What's wrong?

17:23.917 --> 17:27.379
There was an incident between him
and a vampire officer.

17:29.631 --> 17:31.842
It's sunny. The forecast was wrong.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.971
This is my first time here
since my trip to Tokyo, Director Anzai!

17:36.513 --> 17:38.474
Don't get excited! We're not here for fun.

17:38.682 --> 17:40.893
And call me by my maiden name
while we're here.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.771
I'm Director Sako
until we return to Obihiro.

17:43.854 --> 17:49.651
-Vanquish the vampires!
-Vanquish the vampires!

17:49.860 --> 17:52.362
The Redeyes' Rights Protection Committee.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.698
Also known as R2PC.

17:54.948 --> 17:58.202
This committee works
for the growth of vampires' rights.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.162
I happen to be a member.

18:00.579 --> 18:04.374
The real reason I came to Tokyo
was to attend this meeting.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.335
Why are we here?

18:06.794 --> 18:08.378
And Tsukasa as well.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.588
Is there a reason for it?

18:10.255 --> 18:13.425
You must be tired from training,
I thought I would give you guys a break.

18:14.009 --> 18:18.305
I can get two guests a free dinner.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.562
ONL RESEARCH DIVISION CHIEF
MIDORI SAKO

18:28.816 --> 18:30.484
How is ONLO these days?

18:31.151 --> 18:34.321
Nothing much has changed.
It's peaceful. Everyone's doing well.

18:34.530 --> 18:37.908
I heard more senior students
are hoping to be police officers now.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.868
How's the laboratory doing?

18:41.161 --> 18:43.580
I thought you promised not to pry?

18:43.831 --> 18:44.915
Oh, you're right.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.418
Also, you might run
into a gentleman later.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.754
He brought me here today.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.381
What the heck?

18:54.216 --> 18:55.884
What a beautiful view!

18:56.093 --> 18:57.886
It is the 46th floor and all.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.472
The restaurant is one floor down.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.475
It opens at 6:00 p.m.,
should we head down?

19:04.226 --> 19:05.269
I'll just use the bathroom.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.311
Go ahead.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.815
Going out?

19:10.149 --> 19:12.985
We made it official, but what happens now?

19:14.069 --> 19:15.779
If we continue my training,

19:17.364 --> 19:18.657
more naturally...

19:25.747 --> 19:26.582
Can I help you?

19:27.207 --> 19:28.792
Oh, no.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.045
I'm sorry. I thought I knew you.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.088
My apologies.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.006
It's nothing.

19:34.089 --> 19:34.923
MIDORI SAKO

19:35.007 --> 19:36.675
Aren't you attending the conference?

19:38.051 --> 19:41.972
I'm not a member.
I'm just here to accompany someone.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.266
Sorry to keep you waiting!

19:45.309 --> 19:46.268
I'm sorry!

19:47.186 --> 19:49.479
Well, we'll be going then. Excuse me.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.360
I hope the two of you enjoy yourselves.

19:57.988 --> 19:58.822
Yes.

20:00.741 --> 20:01.617
Do you know her?

20:01.909 --> 20:03.702
No, we just met.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.956
She looked a little like you, didn't she?

20:11.126 --> 20:13.879
"You might run into a gentleman."

20:14.671 --> 20:15.797
That old man.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.842
Yuki has become a good young man.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.969
I wish I could show you, too,

20:22.095 --> 20:23.013
Tamaki.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.975
I will speak frankly.

20:27.517 --> 20:28.852
It is in our best interest to postpone

20:28.936 --> 20:33.398
the bill allowing sex between humans
and vampires in the presence of a doctor.

20:34.316 --> 20:38.320
ONLO is pursuing the development
of restraints for sexual activity,

20:38.695 --> 20:43.450
but the need to run safety checks
and ensure availability remains.

20:43.825 --> 20:46.954
Passing this bill while failing
to take such precautions

20:47.412 --> 20:48.956
would be like setting a trap.

20:49.456 --> 20:53.293
Vampires are now exposed to the world
because of the Ikebukuro incident.

20:53.377 --> 20:56.964
It could be that the government
is using the laws to capture vampires

20:57.422 --> 21:00.634
and eliminate them from society.

22:40.442 --> 22:42.360
OBIHIRO NATIONAL RESEARCH FACILITY

22:42.861 --> 22:46.948
I ran into him by chance,
and I couldn't tell him I was his mother.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.202
But he's all grown up now.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.245
He even had a human girlfriend with him.

22:54.122 --> 22:55.916
I'm a little worried, too.

22:56.291 --> 22:59.503
But I'm confident that they'll be okay.

22:59.836 --> 23:01.671
Their faces told me that much.

23:02.464 --> 23:05.675
I wanted to tell you so badly
that I hurried all the way back here.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.928
But there weren't any more direct flights.

23:09.387 --> 23:10.597
I want to hug...

23:11.556 --> 23:13.600
Yuki? Or me?

23:15.268 --> 23:16.353
Both of you.

23:17.229 --> 23:21.691
Right. I hope we can, someday,

23:22.317 --> 23:23.151
Tamaki.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.122
Devils' Line.

23:35.747 --> 23:36.665
Line 9.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.250
Command.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.836
