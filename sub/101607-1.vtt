WEBVTT

01:00.930 --> 01:04.629
I grew up in a quiet suburban
town just north of New York.

01:04.673 --> 01:07.893
On special occasions, my dad
would take me into the city

01:07.937 --> 01:11.375
and we would go and get dessert
at the Waldorf or the Plaza.

01:11.419 --> 01:14.465
I loved watching the
people around us.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.424
They seemed to have
interesting lives.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.122
I wanted to be one of them.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.081
I wanted to write novels,

01:21.124 --> 01:23.822
and speak five
languages and travel.

01:25.433 --> 01:26.956
I didn't want to be ordinary.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.047
I wanted to be extraordinary.

01:34.268 --> 01:36.748
Those memories came storming
back to me last year

01:36.792 --> 01:39.882
when I came to visit my
best friend in New York.

01:39.925 --> 01:41.927
I was only supposed
to stay a few days,

01:41.971 --> 01:43.451
and then return to Berkeley,

01:44.278 --> 01:46.149
where my boyfriend
was waiting on me.

01:49.413 --> 01:50.501
But something shifted.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.243
I wanna stay in New
York for a while.

01:54.331 --> 01:55.854
A while?

01:55.898 --> 01:57.943
What do you mean a while?
What about your semester?

01:57.987 --> 01:59.554
- Yeah, but see that's just it,

01:59.597 --> 02:01.425
I don't want to analyze other
people's work anymore, Karl.

02:01.469 --> 02:02.296
I wanna write.

02:03.297 --> 02:04.559
In New York?

02:04.602 --> 02:05.429
Yeah.

02:08.432 --> 02:09.259
In New York.

02:11.305 --> 02:13.220
Isn't that what
aspiring writers did?

02:13.263 --> 02:16.353
Live in cheap apartments
and write in cafes?

02:17.833 --> 02:21.315
Yeah, I know, but
it's what I wanted.

02:55.218 --> 02:58.961
My boss says we're going
paperless, all emails.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.789
It's driving me nuts

03:00.832 --> 03:02.878
with everyone writing
about nothing,

03:02.921 --> 03:06.055
answering thanks or
worse, you're welcome.

03:06.098 --> 03:08.623
My colleague sends
me emails to ask me

03:08.666 --> 03:10.015
when I'm having lunch.

03:10.059 --> 03:12.844
I hope this is just a
trend that will phase out.

03:12.888 --> 03:14.585
I miss your rants.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.545
Everyone in Berkeley
is so serious,

03:17.588 --> 03:20.156
and the jogging
and wearing Tivos.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.375
Fucking Tivos?

03:23.377 --> 03:26.336
I'm like this big cloud
of East Coast irony
haunting Southern California.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.556
Turning everything into Ash.

03:29.557 --> 03:30.384
That's me.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.604
Does Karl feel the same?

03:37.521 --> 03:39.306
Um, it's not really
the same for him

03:39.349 --> 03:41.830
'cause he's been there
for a couple of years

03:41.873 --> 03:45.877
and the university sorta
treats him like a star.

03:45.921 --> 03:46.791
Huh, well-

03:47.792 --> 03:48.619
Hey, Jenny.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.710
I don't know exactly how
long I'm gonna be staying

03:52.754 --> 03:53.581
in New York.

03:54.886 --> 03:57.889
Don't worry, just keep
making yourself at home.

03:57.933 --> 03:58.977
Eat anything.

04:01.371 --> 04:02.242
Okay.

04:10.467 --> 04:14.515
MA in English
literature, University College
in London,

04:14.558 --> 04:16.908
I suppose that would
make you more appealing

04:16.952 --> 04:20.129
to some publishers,
less to most.

04:21.435 --> 04:24.264
You published poetry?

04:24.307 --> 04:27.310
Yes, yes, in the Paris Review.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.704
I just won their
student contest.

04:29.747 --> 04:32.359
Leave that out. Publishers
avoid wannabe writers.

04:32.402 --> 04:37.189
Oh, that is what I want
to do though. Eventually.

04:38.321 --> 04:40.628
Oh, I got it.

04:40.671 --> 04:45.285
Not a publisher. How
about a literary agency?

04:47.591 --> 04:48.679
Great.

04:48.723 --> 04:51.116
The oldest in New
York. Do you type?

04:51.160 --> 04:53.945
Uh, I took typing
in seventh grade.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.033
Of course you don't type.

04:55.077 --> 04:56.208
She's gonna ask
you if you can type

04:56.252 --> 04:57.297
and you are gonna say?

04:59.299 --> 05:00.300
Yes.

05:01.475 --> 05:02.432
60 words a minute

05:10.135 --> 05:12.312
But do you type on a typewriter?

05:13.400 --> 05:16.620
It's very different from typing
on one of those computers.

05:17.752 --> 05:18.579
Yes.

05:21.364 --> 05:22.670
What do you like to read?

05:26.413 --> 05:27.327
Everything.

05:28.632 --> 05:32.157
Laurie, Hammet, Donald Westlake.

05:32.201 --> 05:35.552
I just finished "A Sentimental
Education" and I loved it.

05:35.596 --> 05:38.120
It was so contemporary,
I was amazed

05:38.163 --> 05:42.167
but to be in this field,

05:42.211 --> 05:45.127
you'll need to read
authors who are alive.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.346
I love Flamel.

05:47.303 --> 05:50.350
I like Westlake. He's funny.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.267
I guess you can start
after Christmas.

05:55.311 --> 05:57.008
We'll talk about Jerry then.

05:57.052 --> 05:58.270
Ah, Jerry.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.837
I'm sure you've
heard that he's crazy

05:59.881 --> 06:03.145
or senile or a
misanthrope, all lies.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.755
He's not the problem.

06:04.799 --> 06:07.671
It's these people
who relentlessly
call for his address,

06:07.715 --> 06:10.979
his phone number, asking to
be put in touch with him.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.937
Or even with me.

06:12.981 --> 06:17.377
Reporters, students,
university deans, producers.

06:17.420 --> 06:20.510
They can be persuasive,
manipulative,

06:20.554 --> 06:25.515
but you must never ever
give out his address.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.648
Do you understand?

06:28.475 --> 06:30.390
I understand.

06:30.433 --> 06:33.871
Good, remember,
there's no shortage

06:33.915 --> 06:36.744
of college graduates
who want this job.

06:39.007 --> 06:41.488
Be prepared for long hours.

06:41.531 --> 06:43.228
Pam will give you a key

06:44.273 --> 06:45.709
Pam, okay.

06:46.841 --> 06:48.146
Thank you so much.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.235
I can't tell you how
honored and thrilled I am.

06:50.279 --> 06:53.543
No need to be honored,
thrilled maybe.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.066
Margaret is pretty thrilling.

06:58.592 --> 06:59.767
I'm Daniel by the way.

07:12.954 --> 07:13.911
That Jerry.

07:21.092 --> 07:24.531
I didn't know yet
what a literary agency was,

07:24.574 --> 07:28.448
but it felt like I'd stepped
closer to the world of writers.

07:29.405 --> 07:34.410
I was to be surrounded by
god-like literary names.

07:34.628 --> 07:37.457
No doubt their proximity
would inspire my own writing.

07:44.464 --> 07:48.555
- Well, Congratulations
on your new job.

07:48.598 --> 07:49.991
Here's your key.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.950
Do not lose it.

07:52.994 --> 07:56.258
We will expect you at
8:00 AM sharp, January 8th.

08:00.349 --> 08:02.046
I never went back to Berkeley.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.875
New York was to be my new
home, writing my new life

08:04.919 --> 08:06.877
with a coveted job
to pay the rent.

08:06.921 --> 08:07.748
Hi.

08:07.791 --> 08:08.662
Hey.

08:08.705 --> 08:11.839
Hey, come, come, come join us.

08:12.970 --> 08:13.754
Hi.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.451
This is Joanna.

08:16.321 --> 08:17.627
This is Mark, this is Lisa.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.760
They just got engaged, so-

08:19.803 --> 08:23.546
Oh wow. Oh my goodness,
congratulations.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.330
Sit down.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.986
The office is incredible.

08:29.030 --> 08:31.772
It's like nothing's
changed since 1927,

08:31.815 --> 08:35.384
and I'm guessing
my boss represents-

08:35.427 --> 08:36.559
- Anne Rice.
- The Pope.

08:36.603 --> 08:37.604
Thomas Pynchon.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.562
J. D. Salinger.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.346
- No way.
- He's still alive?

08:41.390 --> 08:43.392
Yeah, he is, he lives
up in New Hampshire

08:43.435 --> 08:45.655
in basically total isolation.

08:45.699 --> 08:48.005
Reporters are always trying to
ambush him in the local diner

08:48.049 --> 08:49.746
or try to sneak
onto his property.

08:49.790 --> 08:50.834
I love "Catcher In The Rye",

08:50.878 --> 08:52.532
but "Franny and
Zoe" is my favorite.

08:52.575 --> 08:55.360
My friend Kat used to
work at his publishers.

08:55.404 --> 08:56.971
And one night, she
was working late.

08:57.014 --> 09:00.496
Like 1:00 AM late, and the
phone rings in the office

09:00.540 --> 09:02.019
and keeps ringing.

09:02.063 --> 09:05.327
So she picks it up and she
heard someone screaming.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.547
The manuscript is okay!

09:07.590 --> 09:11.333
I saved the manuscript
from the fire.

09:11.376 --> 09:12.682
Salinger?

09:12.726 --> 09:14.423
His house had burned down

09:14.466 --> 09:16.338
and he called in the
middle of the night

09:16.381 --> 09:18.775
assuming someone would
be at the office.

09:18.819 --> 09:19.907
Isn't that crazy?

09:19.950 --> 09:20.995
I read that he's still writing,

09:21.038 --> 09:22.431
but that he doesn't
wanna publish.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.259
Writing makes you a
writer, not publishing.

09:24.302 --> 09:25.652
Publishing is commerce.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.915
Such a crock of shit, Don.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.830
This is some preemptive
strike argument

09:29.873 --> 09:32.920
in case he never sells a novel,
if you ever finish writing.

09:32.963 --> 09:35.705
I will, but today
is about Joanna

09:35.749 --> 09:37.228
and her crossing
to the dark side

09:37.272 --> 09:39.970
with the book munchers, cheers.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.581
Cheers.
Thanks.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.280
I had met Don days earlier
in a socialist bookstore

09:45.323 --> 09:46.586
where he worked part time.

09:48.849 --> 09:51.068
Haven't seen you
around here before.

09:51.112 --> 09:53.767
Let me guess, you're an
intern at the New Yorker.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.465
Besides fighting materialism

09:56.508 --> 09:59.642
and raising class awareness,
Don was into boxing,

09:59.686 --> 10:01.426
Norman Mailer, and?

10:01.470 --> 10:02.732
I'm writing a novel.

10:02.776 --> 10:05.343
He was straightforward
about being a writer.

10:05.387 --> 10:06.910
I admired his confidence.

10:06.954 --> 10:09.565
Do you know the Panama Cafe?

10:09.609 --> 10:12.437
It's on Avenue Way, it's kind
of like a writers' hangout.

10:12.481 --> 10:13.656
I do actually. Yeah,
they have poetry-

10:13.700 --> 10:14.570
Poetry reading.

10:17.225 --> 10:19.531
Love is the one
who's hard to find,

10:19.575 --> 10:21.882
love's the one who
knows your mind,

10:21.925 --> 10:24.232
love's the one who
feeds your soul,

10:24.275 --> 10:27.148
love's the one to have and hold.

10:27.191 --> 10:29.585
But hold a minute, hold how,

10:29.629 --> 10:31.979
there's a hundred hungry
ways to hold her up

10:32.022 --> 10:33.197
or hold her down.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.547
Will she still be
able to get around.

10:35.591 --> 10:37.767
Will she be able to hold
her breath .

10:46.341 --> 10:47.647
Where the hell were you?

10:48.473 --> 10:49.997
Cut the goddamn grass today

10:50.040 --> 10:52.303
or else I'm selling
your K car, you hear?

11:01.878 --> 11:04.881
Dear Mr. Salinger,
I read your book,

11:04.925 --> 11:07.492
"The Catcher In The
Rye" three times now.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.973
It's a masterpiece, and I
hope you're proud of it.

11:10.017 --> 11:11.627
I mean, you certainly should be.

11:13.324 --> 11:16.676
Most of the crap that's written
today is so uncompelling

11:16.719 --> 11:18.242
it makes me sick.

11:18.286 --> 11:19.940
I mean, not too many
people write anything

11:19.983 --> 11:21.463
that even approaches sincerity.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.247
And I don't mean to
say that everyone

11:23.291 --> 11:24.727
who reads your book gets it.

11:24.771 --> 11:28.470
Not at all, lots
of people don't.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.733
I mean I can give you
plenty of idiotic examples,

11:30.777 --> 11:31.603
but I won't.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.696
Hell, you might be
laughing out loud right now

11:36.739 --> 11:39.220
at the thought but
I think I get it.

11:40.308 --> 11:41.135
Maybe I don't.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.097
Wow.

12:04.419 --> 12:07.074
Well, you are here.

12:07.117 --> 12:08.423
- I am.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.730
- We know you can type, hooray

12:10.773 --> 12:12.775
but have you ever
used a dictaphone?

12:14.821 --> 12:16.083
At ease.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.954
It can be tricky at first,

12:17.998 --> 12:19.913
but I'm sure you'll
get the hang of it.

12:21.349 --> 12:26.180
Play, rewind, and I think
those control speed.

12:26.223 --> 12:27.659
- Hugh can help.
- Hugh?

12:27.703 --> 12:29.531
You can get started with these.

12:33.230 --> 12:38.061
This is our technological
area. It is all very new.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.716
This is a Xerox machine
you'll use to make copies

12:40.760 --> 12:42.239
of my correspondence.

12:42.283 --> 12:45.721
I believe that is the button
you press to make a copy.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.157
Did she give you her speech

12:47.201 --> 12:49.203
about the evils of
the digital age yet?

12:49.246 --> 12:51.335
Max, this is Joanna,
my new assistant.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.729
Hello, Joanna. Nice to meet you.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.168
So there are no computers?

12:58.212 --> 13:00.823
We choose not to use computers.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.259
I've seen them in action.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.871
They just make more work
for everyone, wasting time.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.179
All right, as you can see,

13:09.223 --> 13:12.704
we have a relaxed,
cordial environment.

13:12.748 --> 13:15.142
We ask that you don't
wear dungarees, sneakers,

13:15.185 --> 13:18.449
T-shirts, sweatshirts,
especially the kind with hoods.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.147
No open-toed shoes,

13:20.190 --> 13:23.193
but it's perfectly fine to wear
trousers if you're a woman,

13:23.237 --> 13:26.022
and no need to wear
stockings in the summer.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.894
Bare legs are perfectly fine.

13:27.937 --> 13:30.418
And if Jerry calls you just say,

13:30.461 --> 13:33.421
"Yes, Jerry, I will
let my boss know."

13:33.464 --> 13:34.335
Jerry Salinger?

13:34.378 --> 13:36.250
Well of course, Jerry Salinger.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.644
And above all, you
never ever call him.

13:39.688 --> 13:42.517
Why would I
call Jerry Salinger?

13:42.560 --> 13:44.736
Jerry doesn't wanna hear
about how much you love

13:44.780 --> 13:46.347
"The Catcher In The Rye".

13:46.390 --> 13:49.132
And he doesn't want
to read your stories.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.351
Don't have stories.

13:50.394 --> 13:53.397
Good, writers make
the worst assistants.

13:54.224 --> 13:55.051
Get to work.

14:09.631 --> 14:13.504
The
proprietor hereby grants to the
publisher.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.420
Starting from the day...

14:18.335 --> 14:20.816
I'm Hugh, you must be Joanna.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.905
Yes, hi. Nice to meet you.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.255
If you need anything,
I'm right here.

14:25.299 --> 14:30.043
I take care of contracts, legal,
copyrights, the fun stuff.

14:31.783 --> 14:34.917
Salinger's letters, fan mail.

14:34.961 --> 14:38.878
You need to answer
them using these.

14:39.966 --> 14:42.011
There's one for each
type of inquiry;

14:42.055 --> 14:44.405
adaptation, autobiography,

14:44.448 --> 14:48.322
autograph, photograph,
interview, celebrity auction.

14:52.935 --> 14:53.936
Mr. Salinger does not wish

14:53.980 --> 14:55.416
to receive mail
from his readers.

14:55.459 --> 14:58.114
Thus we cannot pass
your kind note onto him.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.899
1963?

14:59.942 --> 15:02.553
That's the year he stopped
responding himself.

15:02.597 --> 15:06.035
You need to take the new one
based exactly on this verbatim.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.210
No change.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.300
So Salinger doesn't
get any of his mail?

15:10.344 --> 15:13.390
Not one. You shred
them in the shredder.

15:13.434 --> 15:14.957
You should always read them.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.046
Yes, indeed.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.656
- Just in case.
- Just in case.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.050
In case of what?

15:21.094 --> 15:22.225
We've been extra careful

15:22.269 --> 15:24.619
since the Mark
David Chapman thing.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.621
John Lennon's assassin.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.318
When the police
arrived at the Dakota,

15:28.362 --> 15:30.930
they found Chapman calmly
sitting on the sidewalk

15:30.973 --> 15:32.932
reading "Catcher In The Rye".

15:32.975 --> 15:34.324
At his trial Chapman said,

15:34.368 --> 15:37.588
that the big part of him
was Holden Caulfield?

15:37.632 --> 15:39.634
- And the small part of him was,

15:42.898 --> 15:43.812
the devil.

15:49.861 --> 15:52.255
Did Chapman write to Salinger?

15:52.299 --> 15:54.997
We'll never know, since
we throw away the mail.

15:56.651 --> 15:59.001
Read everything thoroughly.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.394
Use your judgment.

16:28.683 --> 16:31.164
I think about Holden a lot.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.817
When I first think about him,

16:32.861 --> 16:34.863
I get a stupid grin
on my face, you know?

16:35.777 --> 16:38.084
Thinking about what a
funny guy he is and all.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.262
But then I usually
get depressed as hell

16:43.350 --> 16:44.829
'cause I only think about Holden

16:44.873 --> 16:46.701
when I'm feeling
very emotional and,

16:48.442 --> 16:50.400
I can get quite emotional.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.797
I can get quite emotional.

16:57.929 --> 17:00.497
This boy is so earnest.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.195
A major loser is what he is.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.676
- Hey, he is not.
- He is.

17:05.720 --> 17:06.895
He's very sweet.

17:08.201 --> 17:10.029
He's a little funny,
but he's sweet.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.160
And he cares so much.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.466
I can't send him a
letter that says,

17:12.509 --> 17:15.425
"Dear kid, Mr. Salinger
has no interest in you.

17:15.469 --> 17:16.948
So please fuck off."

17:18.080 --> 17:19.560
Look, this one is
from the Netherlands.

17:19.603 --> 17:23.085
Me and my wife trace Holden's
steps around New York.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.173
Did you know that the ducks

17:24.217 --> 17:26.697
in Central Park
stay through winter?

17:26.741 --> 17:29.961
My God, literally a bunch
of obsessive freaks.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.883
I haven't read
"Catcher In The Rye".

17:38.927 --> 17:40.668
You're kidding.

17:40.711 --> 17:42.452
I haven't read any Salinger.

17:45.368 --> 17:48.545
Wow, everybody's read
Catcher at the very least.

17:48.589 --> 17:51.418
Yeah, well, at the risk
of disappointing you,

17:51.461 --> 17:55.161
there are actually a few
writers that I've yet to read.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.379
Well, I'm shocked.

17:57.815 --> 18:01.080
Okay, look, this girl is
ready to go to bed with him.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.604
He's 70 something.
Don't be naive.

18:03.647 --> 18:06.259
Good literature is a
powerful aphrodisiac.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.873
I never had that
teenage Salinger moment.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.093
We never read "Catcher
In The Rye" at school.

18:14.136 --> 18:18.923
And later I was interested
in difficult, gritty fiction.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.925
Hey, hun.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.971
Jenny's not here right now.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.278
- Oh, I'll be in the kitchen.

18:25.321 --> 18:26.931
I imagine
Salinger's books

18:26.975 --> 18:31.936
to be insufferably cute,
quirky and precious.

18:33.634 --> 18:34.939
I didn't want to be entertained.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.289
I wanted to be provoked.

18:59.312 --> 19:02.967
- My shoulder hurts from
carrying all those manuscripts.

19:03.011 --> 19:04.186
- Hey, Joanna.
- Hi.

19:06.014 --> 19:08.451
Oh, I found a writer for
Max out of the slush pile.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.671
The stories are so good,
I read them last night

19:10.714 --> 19:12.151
and I was sobbing by the end.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.680
What's the slush pile?

19:19.723 --> 19:21.421
The slush pile?

19:21.464 --> 19:23.118
Okay, it's like the most amazing

19:23.162 --> 19:25.120
and most horrible
part of our job.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.035
The stack of manuscripts
nobody wants to read.

19:27.078 --> 19:29.472
Basically it's all the
unsolicited query letters.

19:29.516 --> 19:32.432
People with no referral
who write to agents cold.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.825
The slush pile is
like 99% crazy shit.

19:34.869 --> 19:37.350
Though some of it is
seriously hilarious.

19:37.393 --> 19:41.702
But very, very occasionally
you find something amazing.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.401
Your boss doesn't let you read?

19:46.533 --> 19:48.274
I'm available to
read manuscripts,

19:48.317 --> 19:49.840
should that be something
that you're interested in

19:49.884 --> 19:51.538
at home or my free
time of course.

19:52.887 --> 19:54.062
Manuscripts?

19:55.933 --> 19:57.196
No.

20:00.764 --> 20:04.028
Tabs wrong, margins wrong,

20:04.072 --> 20:07.510
proper names wrong,
really, everything wrong.

20:07.554 --> 20:10.209
You can start retyping today.

20:10.252 --> 20:14.082
And here as a bonus
is today's dictation.

20:15.431 --> 20:18.260
Forget about manuscripts.

20:18.304 --> 20:20.567
You need to get that right.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.093
Is it on?

20:28.749 --> 20:32.056
As you know, I believe
that computers make work

20:32.100 --> 20:33.710
rather than alleviate it.

20:33.754 --> 20:36.365
But I agreed to install
one in the office

20:36.409 --> 20:38.062
on a trial basis because-

20:38.106 --> 20:40.587
It came in an elegant black.

20:40.630 --> 20:44.025
Because Hugh
discovered that people,

20:44.068 --> 20:45.374
I don't know who
these people are

20:45.418 --> 20:46.941
and why they don't have
more important things

20:46.984 --> 20:48.421
to do with their lives,

20:48.464 --> 20:52.251
but people have been publishing
whole Salinger stories

20:52.294 --> 20:55.079
on their personal e-webs.

20:55.123 --> 20:57.038
Web blogs.

20:57.081 --> 20:58.561
Web blogs, ridiculous.

20:58.605 --> 21:01.085
This is blatant
copyright infringement.

21:01.129 --> 21:05.089
And we're going to have
to scour the worldwide web

21:05.133 --> 21:06.482
to put an end to it.

21:06.526 --> 21:09.833
And that is all the
computer is to be used for.

21:09.877 --> 21:12.445
Sorry to interrupt.
Just passing through.

21:14.142 --> 21:15.448
Don't mean to cause a fuss.

21:18.973 --> 21:20.322
We can turn it off now.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.585
Uh, it's already off.

21:22.629 --> 21:23.978
Okay, good.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.284
And then maybe the little
coat that goes over it,

21:25.327 --> 21:27.286
I've seen it in
pictures. Thank you, Max.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.679
I'm afraid
we don't have...

21:31.986 --> 21:34.945
There were
hundreds of us, thousands maybe,

21:34.989 --> 21:39.602
all girls working at literary
agencies or publishing houses.

21:39.646 --> 21:41.735
We answered calls
for our bosses,

21:41.778 --> 21:44.868
ushered in the writers,
fetched them water.

21:44.912 --> 21:46.130
Never belying the fact

21:46.174 --> 21:48.611
that we wanted to be
writers ourselves.

21:49.569 --> 21:51.527
We whispered about
the lucky ones,

21:51.571 --> 21:53.616
the ones who were
mentored by their bosses,

21:53.660 --> 21:57.316
who were allowed to take
on books or clients.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.796
The ones who broke the
rules to show initiative.

22:03.191 --> 22:05.149
The ones who wanted
it badly enough.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.239
Please find two
copies of the contract

22:08.283 --> 22:10.764
with St. Martin publishing.

22:11.939 --> 22:14.985
Let's face it. I
was a secretary.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.013
Hello?

22:43.057 --> 22:44.841
Hello? Hello?

22:44.885 --> 22:46.016
- Hello.

22:46.060 --> 22:49.150
- Speaking to? It's Jerry.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.327
- Hello, Mr. Salinger.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.981
- Who is this?

22:54.024 --> 22:55.678
- This is Joanna.

22:55.722 --> 22:57.288
- Who?

22:57.332 --> 23:00.204
- I'm Joanna, I'm
Margaret's new assistant.

23:00.248 --> 23:02.685
- Oh, Margaret's new assistant.

23:02.729 --> 23:03.991
Nice to meet you, Susanna.

23:04.034 --> 23:05.209
How do you like your job?

23:05.253 --> 23:06.472
- I love it.

23:06.515 --> 23:07.690
- Good to hear.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.866
I'm calling to
speak to your boss.

23:09.910 --> 23:12.216
- Unfortunately, she's
not in right now.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.783
Can I leave her a message?

23:13.827 --> 23:16.395
- Oh, no. I'll call back.

23:16.438 --> 23:17.700
Well, I'm sure you
have a lot of work.

23:17.744 --> 23:20.224
It was very nice
talking to you, Susanna.

23:20.268 --> 23:23.010
I'm looking forward to
meeting you in person.

23:23.053 --> 23:23.880
- You too.

23:25.752 --> 23:26.709
Have a great day.

23:26.753 --> 23:27.667
- Goodbye.

23:33.194 --> 23:35.065
- I never say have a great day

23:35.109 --> 23:35.936
Jerry?

23:37.416 --> 23:39.853
He's deaf, explosion
during the war.

23:39.896 --> 23:42.464
- She just left?
- Yes.

23:42.508 --> 23:43.422
Better go tell her.

23:51.212 --> 23:52.039
Quicker.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.785
Margaret. Sorry.

23:59.742 --> 24:00.526
I'm sorry to disturb you,

24:00.569 --> 24:01.788
we just got a call from,

24:02.832 --> 24:04.443
your client just called.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.445
I wonder which one.

24:07.271 --> 24:08.925
I have to take this.

24:08.969 --> 24:11.232
Go ahead, boss. I'll wait
for you at the restaurant.

24:12.581 --> 24:14.191
You did the right thing.

24:14.235 --> 24:16.716
Salinger wants to
publish a book.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.721
The press is gonna go nuts.

24:21.764 --> 24:24.724
No press, no one must
know, that's our job.

24:25.594 --> 24:26.682
So it's true. He's been writing.

24:26.726 --> 24:28.510
Well, no, it's an old story.

24:28.554 --> 24:30.860
Hapworth, publisher.

24:30.904 --> 24:33.646
Clifford Bradbury
approached him to publish it

24:33.689 --> 24:35.952
as a standalone book.

24:35.996 --> 24:38.781
He has been thinking
about it for eight years.

24:38.825 --> 24:41.480
The publisher wrote
to him back in '88.

24:41.523 --> 24:44.787
Jerry liked the fact that
he wrote on a typewriter.

24:44.831 --> 24:46.572
How did he get Jerry's address?

24:46.615 --> 24:48.399
He addressed it
to J.D. Salinger,

24:48.443 --> 24:49.966
Cornish, New Hampshire.

24:50.010 --> 24:51.272
Postman delivered it.

24:51.315 --> 24:54.057
That's brilliant.

24:54.101 --> 24:55.798
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, Margaret.

24:55.842 --> 24:58.148
What kind of publisher is this?

24:58.192 --> 25:00.107
It can't be Little Brown
or any major house,

25:00.150 --> 25:01.195
they would have just called you.

25:01.238 --> 25:03.023
Oh boy, you're gonna
love this, Max.

25:03.066 --> 25:07.549
It is a tiny press in Virginia,
kind of a one-man operation.

25:07.593 --> 25:10.160
Marygold press.

25:10.204 --> 25:11.727
Mary Bell's Press?

25:11.771 --> 25:15.252
Yes, that's it. You know them?

25:15.296 --> 25:18.647
They publish poetry and I
like a few of their poets.

25:18.691 --> 25:21.737
Are you
fucking kidding me?

25:21.781 --> 25:24.697
A one-man press is going
to publish the first book

25:24.740 --> 25:27.438
from Salinger in three decades?

25:27.482 --> 25:28.918
That's fucked.

25:28.962 --> 25:31.965
Publishing Salinger is different
than publishing poetry.

25:32.008 --> 25:33.183
Thank you.

25:33.227 --> 25:35.011
Obviously, we have
to proceed carefully.

25:35.055 --> 25:39.059
Find out everything we can
about this Clifford Bradbury.

25:39.102 --> 25:40.495
I'll call 'em.

25:40.539 --> 25:43.585
I won't mention Salinger
and I'll ask for his catalog

25:43.629 --> 25:45.326
and a sample for our records.

25:45.369 --> 25:47.241
Good thinking.

25:47.284 --> 25:50.244
Hugh, get me the contract
with the New Yorker, please.

25:54.596 --> 25:55.771
What's Hapsworth?

25:56.990 --> 25:59.993
It was published in
the New Yorker in '65.

26:00.036 --> 26:02.386
Took up almost the
whole magazine.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.389
Pretty common in those days.

26:05.433 --> 26:08.001
Esquire did it, Cosmo.

26:08.044 --> 26:10.046
That's where I got my start,

26:10.090 --> 26:12.614
buying stories for a magazine.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.790
For Cosmo?

26:14.834 --> 26:16.531
For Playboy.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.926
How did you end up
working for Playboy?

26:20.883 --> 26:22.798
Enough chit chat, Joanna.

26:22.842 --> 26:23.712
Back to work.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.236
Hi, is this Clifford Bradbury?

26:27.498 --> 26:29.370
Hi, this is Joanna Rakoff.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.807
I work for ANF
Literary Management.

26:31.851 --> 26:34.418
The job of an agent is
to open up opportunities

26:34.462 --> 26:35.985
for their clients.

26:36.029 --> 26:40.686
But when it came to Salinger,
the logic was reversed.

26:40.729 --> 26:43.514
We had to shield him
from the outside world,

26:43.558 --> 26:47.518
bolstering his reputation
as a complicated recluse.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.043
But publishing
Hackworth was going

26:50.086 --> 26:52.219
to get a lot of attention.

26:52.262 --> 26:54.134
Nobody understood
his change of heart.

26:55.222 --> 26:56.527
Night, Jerry.

26:56.571 --> 26:59.922
Maybe I thought I understood.

26:59.966 --> 27:02.011
Maybe he realized
that what he wanted

27:02.055 --> 27:03.534
wasn't what he wanted at all.

27:06.015 --> 27:07.451
Are you serious?

27:07.495 --> 27:11.281
You're like, yeah,
visiting me in my room.

27:55.151 --> 27:57.545
What are you writing?

27:57.588 --> 28:01.157
Writing a very bad
poem.

28:04.813 --> 28:08.469
Listen, Brett and
I were talking and,

28:11.646 --> 28:15.389
look, when you first
got back to New York

28:15.432 --> 28:17.739
and I said that you
could stay here,

28:17.783 --> 28:21.743
to be honest, I thought you'd
go back to Berkeley with Karl.

28:23.919 --> 28:25.878
You're kicking me out?

28:25.921 --> 28:30.012
No, like I'm happy
to have you here.

28:30.056 --> 28:32.667
And you can stay if you want.

28:32.711 --> 28:36.540
But what did you plan on
doing, what are your options?

28:41.894 --> 28:43.504
We disinfected the apartment

28:45.767 --> 28:48.727
'cause the man before
had seven cats,

28:49.815 --> 28:52.426
but young, married,
couple like you

28:53.470 --> 28:55.472
take better care of it, yeah?

28:55.516 --> 28:57.126
We're not married.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.563
The man next door, he
takes care of little things

28:59.607 --> 29:00.913
if you need it.

29:02.871 --> 29:07.876
He's Mexican, he drinks,
but he works hard.

29:08.529 --> 29:09.443
How much?

29:10.574 --> 29:13.795
- 560.
- We'll think about it.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.579
No, we'll take it.

29:16.406 --> 29:20.106
Oh, good deal.
You're Jewish, yeah?

29:20.149 --> 29:21.585
- Me?
- Mm?

29:21.629 --> 29:22.717
No.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.111
I like very responsible

29:27.940 --> 29:30.507
Let's sign the paper.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.901
The lease is gonna
be under her name.

29:32.945 --> 29:33.772
Hm?

29:36.426 --> 29:38.602
Could just given ourselves
a day to think about it.

29:38.646 --> 29:40.213
This is New York
city, young lady.

29:40.256 --> 29:41.214
The big time.

29:41.257 --> 29:42.911
I barely make $300 a week.

29:42.955 --> 29:45.174
No, wait, we split
the rent, booba.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.349
I'm gonna pay my half.

29:46.393 --> 29:48.569
I just have to avoid
the credit check.

29:50.353 --> 29:52.878
Look, I'll take care of
the furniture, all right?

29:52.921 --> 29:53.835
There's no sink.

29:55.619 --> 29:56.490
What?

29:56.533 --> 29:58.187
There's no sink in the kitchen.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.798
I knew that there was something
off about the apartment

29:59.841 --> 30:00.886
but I couldn't put
my finger on it.

30:00.929 --> 30:03.236
And there's no sink
in the kitchen.

30:03.279 --> 30:05.847
We just signed a lease for
an apartment with no sink.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.501
But we can do the
dishes in the bath tub,

30:07.544 --> 30:08.894
it's no big deal.

30:08.937 --> 30:10.504
There's a tub. Trust me.

30:29.915 --> 30:33.832
Dear Mr. Salinger, please
forgive my bad English.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.703
I work much at
night and I like it

30:35.746 --> 30:39.011
because I don't have to
talk to people so much.

30:39.054 --> 30:42.884
My heart is troubled, just
like Holden Caulfield-

30:42.928 --> 30:45.669
Holden is like my
grandfather, you know?

30:45.713 --> 30:47.193
A no-bullshit man.

30:47.236 --> 30:50.849
He taught me a lot
about human nature.

30:50.892 --> 30:53.677
He warned me, I will be
disappointed by most people.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.244
We would be very honored

30:55.288 --> 30:57.899
if you would serve as our
commencement reader next year.

30:57.943 --> 31:00.423
We would, of course provide
you with accommodation

31:00.467 --> 31:03.557
in a very fine inn
where your privacy,

31:03.600 --> 31:05.602
which I know is
important to you,

31:05.646 --> 31:07.866
would be scrupulously respected.

31:07.909 --> 31:11.434
The fishing helps me, a nice
refuge from my nightmares.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.916
It's been 27 years
since Vietnam.

31:16.222 --> 31:18.398
They just keep getting worse.

31:20.095 --> 31:22.576
You know, seeing
your dead friends,

31:22.619 --> 31:24.056
having their guts ripped out.

31:25.492 --> 31:27.363
I'm sure you must have
similar type dreams

31:27.407 --> 31:28.669
being a veteran who-

31:28.712 --> 31:30.889
Does not wish to receive
mail from his readers.

31:30.932 --> 31:34.022
Thus, we can not pass along
your kind note to him.

31:34.066 --> 31:37.547
We thank you for your interest
in Mr. Salinger's book.

31:37.591 --> 31:39.723
My daughter died from leukemia.

31:39.767 --> 31:41.812
She was a talented young writer.

31:41.856 --> 31:44.641
I'm founding a small literary
magazine in her memory,

31:44.685 --> 31:47.383
and I'd like permission
to call it Banana Fish.

31:47.427 --> 31:48.645
The Salinger was her-

32:06.272 --> 32:07.838
Titles can't be copyrighted?

32:07.882 --> 32:09.318
Absolutely, Jerry.

32:09.362 --> 32:11.059
I could write a novel and
call it "The Great Gatsby"

32:11.103 --> 32:12.365
if I wanted to.

32:12.408 --> 32:15.585
So yes, she can call her
magazine Banana Fish.

32:15.629 --> 32:17.109
Great.

32:17.152 --> 32:20.808
But the agency can't advise her.

32:22.636 --> 32:24.116
- Really?
- Yup.

32:24.159 --> 32:26.814
I'm just telling you this
for your own edification.

32:26.857 --> 32:28.947
Send the form letter
and finish shredding.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.209
That's absurd.

32:30.252 --> 32:31.123
Well, of course,
you're right.

32:31.166 --> 32:32.080
She's gonna start yelling at me

32:32.124 --> 32:33.690
the minute she's off the phone.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.999
Pleasure to talk to
you, Jerry, as always.

32:38.043 --> 32:38.957
Goodbye.

32:40.306 --> 32:41.960
Crap sandwich.

32:42.003 --> 32:42.873
Hugh?

32:42.917 --> 32:44.005
Yes.

32:44.049 --> 32:45.789
Do you have the
Salinger contract ready?

32:45.833 --> 32:47.182
Yes, almost there.

32:47.226 --> 32:49.010
Ask Pam to call a messenger

32:49.054 --> 32:52.318
so we can get it over to
the New Yorker before 6:00.

32:52.361 --> 32:54.798
- The New Yorker?
- Yes.

32:54.842 --> 32:57.192
Probably best if I just
bring it myself then, no?

33:01.022 --> 33:03.285
I grew up reading the New Yorker

33:03.329 --> 33:05.287
following my father's ritual.

33:05.331 --> 33:07.115
He would start with
the movie reviews

33:07.159 --> 33:09.204
and then turn to the
talk of the town,

33:09.248 --> 33:10.553
and then the features.

33:11.511 --> 33:14.340
In college, everyone
was into The New Yorker.

33:19.736 --> 33:21.173
Hi.

33:21.216 --> 33:22.348
My boss wanted me to make sure

33:22.391 --> 33:24.393
this was delivered right away.

33:24.437 --> 33:25.264
Thank you.

33:31.183 --> 33:33.141
Can I help you with
something else?

33:33.185 --> 33:34.664
No, no, no, no.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.362
That was it. Thanks.

33:52.204 --> 33:55.859
I was at the Algonquin
serving him a martini.

33:55.903 --> 33:59.689
Anyway, I used my Cosmo
ID to get in the room.

33:59.733 --> 34:02.910
I recognized the agent,
he did not recognize me.

34:02.953 --> 34:04.738
And we spent the evening talking

34:04.781 --> 34:08.046
about William's tragic
death and the agency.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.351
And?

34:09.395 --> 34:11.875
- And I lost my job at
Cosmo for not showing up

34:11.919 --> 34:12.789
the next morning.

34:14.356 --> 34:17.533
But I kept the man's
card, and a year later,

34:17.577 --> 34:20.841
I gave him a call at the agency.

34:20.884 --> 34:22.364
Hi.

34:22.408 --> 34:24.932
And he hired me, and
the rest is history.

34:24.975 --> 34:27.108
Joanna, what is it?
Something wrong?

34:27.152 --> 34:28.631
No.

34:28.675 --> 34:32.113
She was walking by looking
cold and hungry and forlorn.

34:32.157 --> 34:33.549
And I invited her in.

34:33.593 --> 34:34.594
Joanna, please sit down.

34:34.637 --> 34:35.725
I really don't
want to interrupt.

34:35.769 --> 34:36.596
Don't be silly.

34:37.771 --> 34:38.554
This is my wife, Helen.

34:38.598 --> 34:40.208
Nice to meet you.

34:40.252 --> 34:41.427
We were just reminiscing,

34:41.470 --> 34:42.906
telling tales about
the lost generation.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.212
Hemingway, Fitzgerald.

34:44.256 --> 34:45.735
Do you know the agency
represented Fitzgerald?

34:45.779 --> 34:47.128
Of course, yes.

34:47.172 --> 34:50.088
And Dylan Thomas, Langston
Hughes, Agatha Christie.

34:50.131 --> 34:52.220
And you've read all
their work, of course

34:52.264 --> 34:55.615
I have, however, my boss
suggests that I read writers

34:55.658 --> 34:56.877
that are alive.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.271
Speaking of living writers,

34:59.314 --> 35:01.186
are you familiar
with Rachel Cusk?

35:01.229 --> 35:02.578
Don't take the bait, Joanna.

35:02.622 --> 35:04.232
I am. Yes, I am, I am.

35:04.276 --> 35:07.235
Her first novel,
"Saving Agnes" was huge.

35:07.279 --> 35:08.758
It won the Whitbread, I think?

35:08.802 --> 35:11.935
And everyone that I knew
in London was reading it.

35:11.979 --> 35:14.982
It was our lives basically,
or it was my life.

35:15.025 --> 35:16.114
What is it about?

35:18.638 --> 35:20.988
Well, it's a coming-of-
age tale, definitely.

35:21.031 --> 35:22.816
I guess it's about the
ways in which women

35:22.859 --> 35:26.298
need to get over this self
-loathing of their bodies say.

35:26.341 --> 35:30.258
I'd say it's more about how
the patriarchy imposes rigid

35:30.302 --> 35:33.305
and terrifying ideas of
femininity onto young women.

35:33.348 --> 35:37.613
How that paralyzes them, and
strips them of their dignity.

35:37.657 --> 35:39.441
I don't know, it doesn't feel
quite that didactic to me.

35:39.485 --> 35:42.009
It's a very introspective novel.

35:42.052 --> 35:43.750
It doesn't really read
like social commentary.

35:43.793 --> 35:47.014
Okay, Joanna meet Rachel Cusk.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.799
- Hello.
- No, no.

35:51.018 --> 35:52.498
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

35:52.541 --> 35:54.456
It's lovely to meet you.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.284
You're a novelist yourself?

35:56.328 --> 35:59.287
Joanne is my assistant.
I don't hire writers.

35:59.331 --> 36:01.333
I'm very particular about it.

36:01.376 --> 36:02.464
Really?

36:02.508 --> 36:03.857
I thought all
publishing assistants

36:03.900 --> 36:05.467
were writing novels
at their desk.

36:05.511 --> 36:06.860
If you can write a
novel at your desk

36:06.903 --> 36:08.818
while fetching coffee for
a tyrant like Margaret,

36:08.862 --> 36:10.298
good luck.

36:10.342 --> 36:11.952
Well, you really
have to love it.

36:11.995 --> 36:14.215
You have to want it more than
anything in the entire world.

36:14.259 --> 36:18.480
More than a boyfriend or a
closet full of pretty dresses,

36:18.524 --> 36:22.180
or a fancy job that
makes everyone jealous.

36:22.223 --> 36:25.313
You need to be
okay with saying no

36:25.357 --> 36:27.185
when you're invited to a party,

36:27.228 --> 36:28.490
and you really need to be okay

36:28.534 --> 36:31.232
with having your mother
and father hate you.

36:31.276 --> 36:34.017
Joanna, don't you have
some dictation to finish?

36:34.061 --> 36:35.802
- Yes, I do.
- Margaret.

36:35.845 --> 36:37.804
Those St. Martins contract memos

36:37.847 --> 36:39.327
need to go out immediately.

36:39.371 --> 36:41.199
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

36:41.242 --> 36:42.678
It was nice to meet
you all, thank you.

36:42.722 --> 36:45.028
- Bye.
- Lovely to meet you.

37:25.068 --> 37:25.895
Hi.

37:27.767 --> 37:31.249
You got a letter from your
high school sweetheart, Karl.

37:34.687 --> 37:36.428
Does he know about us?

37:39.082 --> 37:40.258
Yeah, I'm sure I mentioned it.

37:40.301 --> 37:42.085
Joanna, did you
break up with him?

37:42.129 --> 37:43.217
Like a proper breakup?

37:43.261 --> 37:45.219
"Dear Karl, it's
not you it's me.

37:45.263 --> 37:48.570
I'm sorry, it's over," you
know, the normal stuff?

37:48.614 --> 37:50.746
We haven't talked
in three months

37:50.790 --> 37:53.358
and he knows that I'm not
going back to California.

37:56.448 --> 37:59.102
Did you talk to the
landlady about the heating?

38:00.452 --> 38:01.888
Why do you need a heater?

38:01.931 --> 38:03.803
Your love should keep you warm.

38:34.660 --> 38:36.444
I was hoping you might find
the time to write back,

38:36.488 --> 38:39.317
but I bet you must be
getting a lot of letters.

38:40.492 --> 38:42.624
But I feel like writing again,

38:42.668 --> 38:43.799
if you don't mind me doing so

38:43.843 --> 38:46.324
'cause well, I feel
depressed as hell.

38:47.673 --> 38:49.501
And I figured it's the
honest thing to do.

38:50.980 --> 38:53.331
Your characters are the
only ones in literature

38:53.374 --> 38:54.680
who are truly like me.

38:55.594 --> 38:56.856
I mean, they take action.

38:56.899 --> 38:58.553
They don't sit around
contemplating suicide.

38:58.597 --> 39:01.774
They pick up a gun and they
shoot themselves in the head.

39:01.817 --> 39:03.602
He's challenging Jerry.

39:03.645 --> 39:06.082
It's a game and
you're falling for it.

39:06.126 --> 39:08.171
I feel this boy just
deserves a proper response,

39:08.215 --> 39:09.738
not our usual bullshit.

39:09.782 --> 39:10.609
Bullshit?

39:12.524 --> 39:17.137
You are confusing
judgment with empathy.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.966
I have read hundreds of
letters just like this one.

39:21.054 --> 39:24.797
It can get overwhelming,
but just do your job.

39:37.897 --> 39:38.941
Did you send my letter
to Mr. Salinger?

39:38.985 --> 39:40.508
Did you send my
letter to Salinger?

39:40.552 --> 39:43.163
You have no right
to keep my letter.

39:44.294 --> 39:46.514
You can't read
other people's mail.

39:46.558 --> 39:49.299
I wat at least expecting
a confirmation.

40:02.095 --> 40:05.054
Dear Mr. Salinger,
I hate school.

40:06.099 --> 40:08.144
Especially English class.

40:08.188 --> 40:11.234
"Catcher In The Rye" is
the only book I liked.

40:11.278 --> 40:13.541
My teacher is going
to make me flunk.

40:13.585 --> 40:15.021
She says I'll have
to repeat my year

40:15.064 --> 40:17.632
and that's gonna
be so embarrassing.

40:18.633 --> 40:20.940
So I asked her, "What can I do?"

40:20.983 --> 40:23.377
"Write a letter to J.D.
Salinger," she told me.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.858
"And make it so good
that he'll write back.

40:25.901 --> 40:27.860
If he writes back,
I'll give you an A."

40:29.383 --> 40:32.734
Please write back,
so I can get an A.

40:36.434 --> 40:40.438
An A earned by trickery
means absolutely nothing.

40:40.481 --> 40:42.265
You'll soon find
out that young women

40:42.309 --> 40:45.443
are often held to
double standards when
it comes to success.

40:48.228 --> 40:51.100
You need to prove to
yourself and to your peers

40:51.144 --> 40:53.233
that you do not need
special treatment.

40:54.495 --> 40:57.237
If you desire an A
or a passing grade,

40:57.280 --> 41:00.153
you must do the work
assigned to you.

41:00.196 --> 41:03.635
And if you want to uphold
the spirit of Holden,

41:03.678 --> 41:06.768
try not to care too much
about how people judge you.

41:06.812 --> 41:09.075
This might mean
being more humble,

41:09.118 --> 41:11.425
but it's the only way.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.906
Sincerely, Joanna Rakoff.

41:20.956 --> 41:24.046
You've become quite the expert
in what Salinger would say.

41:25.526 --> 41:28.529
"If you want to uphold
the spirit of Holden",

41:28.573 --> 41:30.052
have you read Catcher yet?

41:32.664 --> 41:33.839
You haven't?

41:36.406 --> 41:37.233
Unbelievable.

41:44.458 --> 41:46.329
Brett got accepted
at Case Western.

41:47.374 --> 41:48.810
I thought he's going
to Brooklyn Law.

41:48.854 --> 41:50.420
He's from the Midwest.

41:50.464 --> 41:51.596
He misses it, you know?

41:52.771 --> 41:55.077
So you'll stay here
until he's done?

41:55.121 --> 41:58.559
Of course not. I'm
going with him.

41:58.603 --> 41:59.821
We're engaged, remember?

42:01.388 --> 42:03.825
Wait, you're moving?

42:06.654 --> 42:08.613
I thought you loved your work?

42:08.656 --> 42:11.920
I do, but Cleveland
is a cool city.

42:11.964 --> 42:14.401
We're already looking for
a place in Shaker Heights.

42:15.881 --> 42:18.623
Wow. Suburbs.

42:21.669 --> 42:23.149
Have you been writing lately?

42:25.412 --> 42:26.935
I don't really write anymore.

42:28.633 --> 42:31.549
I know we used to say that
we wanted to become writers

42:31.592 --> 42:33.638
but that was more your thing.

42:34.508 --> 42:35.727
I kind of grew out of it.

42:39.861 --> 42:43.604
You make it sound
like a teenage phase.

42:43.648 --> 42:45.214
Isn't that what it was?

42:45.258 --> 42:46.651
I don't understand.

42:46.694 --> 42:47.869
You're dropping everything
for Brett's project?

42:47.913 --> 42:49.479
Whoa, Joanna stop.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.134
I don't wanna be a writer.

42:52.178 --> 42:54.615
You keep saying you want to
write, but you work long hours

42:54.659 --> 42:58.619
for other writers while Don
is at home writing his novel.

42:58.663 --> 43:00.055
Oh, we both write,

43:00.099 --> 43:01.622
and we're supportive
of each other's work.

43:01.666 --> 43:03.493
Well, then I'm
happy for you guys.

43:04.364 --> 43:05.670
Please be happy for me.

43:10.370 --> 43:11.197
I'm sorry.

43:17.290 --> 43:20.206
Why don't we go to the
Waldorf and get dessert?

43:21.294 --> 43:23.078
I'll have the $12 cheesecake.

43:23.122 --> 43:24.384
Maybe we'll catch my boss

43:24.427 --> 43:26.038
on her martini
ones or something.

43:26.995 --> 43:27.822
I gotta get back to work.

43:40.966 --> 43:42.358
Everything to your liking?

43:42.402 --> 43:43.795
Yes, thank you.

44:33.105 --> 44:35.063
May I get you a cab?

44:35.107 --> 44:37.283
It's such a nice day,
I think I'll walk.

44:37.326 --> 44:40.025
It is a beautiful day.
You enjoy it then.

44:40.068 --> 44:40.895
Thanks.

44:51.210 --> 44:52.472
Hello.

44:52.515 --> 44:54.604
- Hello, Susanna.
How are you today?

44:54.648 --> 44:55.736
- I'm great. How are you?

44:55.780 --> 44:57.346
How's the weather in Cornish?

44:57.390 --> 44:59.000
- It's very pleasant.

44:59.044 --> 45:00.654
- Tell me something, Susanna.

45:00.698 --> 45:04.266
I was looking at those books
from this fellow, Clifford,

45:04.310 --> 45:07.052
in Virginia, Mary Bells Press.

45:07.095 --> 45:07.922
- Yes.

45:07.966 --> 45:09.924
- What do you think of them?

45:09.968 --> 45:12.753
- Honestly, I think the
design isn't great.

45:12.797 --> 45:15.887
I think they'd really benefit
from hiring a designer.

45:17.018 --> 45:20.282
But as far as the
books themselves,
I've only read a few.

45:20.326 --> 45:23.416
I do like some of the
poets they publish though.

45:23.459 --> 45:24.765
- Well, you read poetry?

45:24.809 --> 45:26.549
- I do, yes. A lot.

45:26.593 --> 45:28.160
- Do you write poetry yourself?

45:28.203 --> 45:29.030
- I do.

45:30.118 --> 45:31.598
- Oh, I'm very glad to hear
that.

45:31.641 --> 45:34.732
Poetry is food for the
soul. Never forget that.

45:35.863 --> 45:37.212
Susanna.

45:37.256 --> 45:39.345
- Food for the soul,
I've got it.

45:40.694 --> 45:43.044
- Susanna, it's important
to write every day.

45:43.088 --> 45:43.915
You know that?

45:45.394 --> 45:46.656
- I'll keep that in mind.

45:47.614 --> 45:49.659
- Jerry wants to meet Clifford.

45:50.660 --> 45:54.099
Gosh, gotta find
somewhere discreet.

45:54.142 --> 45:55.665
Well, it won't be.

45:55.709 --> 45:58.451
Jerry's driving down to
Washington on Wednesday.

45:58.494 --> 46:01.802
They're meeting in a cafeteria
at Georgetown University.

46:01.846 --> 46:03.717
That's awful. Awful.

46:04.849 --> 46:07.808
Do we trust this
Clifford fellow?

46:07.852 --> 46:09.201
I don't know.

46:09.244 --> 46:13.814
So we're presuming he's
not gonna tip off The Post

46:13.858 --> 46:15.685
that the world's
most reclusive writer

46:15.729 --> 46:16.948
who barely leaves his home,

46:16.991 --> 46:19.341
who hasn't given an
interview in decades,

46:19.385 --> 46:24.390
will be having
lunch at Georgetown
University on Wednesday?

46:24.956 --> 46:26.218
Yeah.

46:26.261 --> 46:29.264
You have mentioned this
possibility to Jerry?

46:29.308 --> 46:32.615
I have not. Jerry thinks
of Clifford as a pal.

46:32.659 --> 46:34.530
If I say anything
negative about him,

46:34.574 --> 46:36.837
Jerry will not take it kindly.

46:36.881 --> 46:38.317
That's it. Back to work.

46:40.319 --> 46:41.233
Oh, Joanna.

46:42.495 --> 46:44.149
Tell me what you think of this.

46:47.239 --> 46:48.631
Judy Blume?

46:48.675 --> 46:50.808
- You've heard of her?
- Of course, I have.

46:51.678 --> 46:53.462
I read all of her
books as a kid.

46:53.506 --> 46:54.942
I love her. Everyone loves her.

46:54.986 --> 46:57.989
She was a client of my
predecessor, Claire.

46:58.032 --> 47:00.034
She's not written a
book in a long time.

47:00.078 --> 47:01.949
Have you ever read Judy Blume?

47:01.993 --> 47:04.822
No, I don't read
children's literature.

47:04.865 --> 47:06.649
But they're so wonderful.

47:06.693 --> 47:09.609
I'm sure, Claire had
impeccable taste.

47:11.698 --> 47:12.568
You wanna go out?

47:13.787 --> 47:14.614
We're broke.

47:15.745 --> 47:18.531
So? We'll split a beer.

47:20.750 --> 47:22.448
It's open mic night at the KGB.

47:25.103 --> 47:27.279
- What?
- You can bring a poem.

47:28.454 --> 47:29.890
They'll love you.

47:29.934 --> 47:32.545
- You're not funny.
- I'm not trying to be.

47:34.590 --> 47:36.201
Your poems are good.

47:37.463 --> 47:39.508
I have a Judy Blume
manuscript to read.

47:39.552 --> 47:40.422
Judy Blume?

47:42.033 --> 47:43.643
Judy fucking Blume?

47:44.731 --> 47:47.429
I loved "Then Again
Maybe I Won't".

47:47.473 --> 47:48.996
You liked Judy Blume?

47:49.040 --> 47:52.391
Yeah, I mean, I was a kid
once and like a hero, Tony,

47:52.434 --> 47:53.871
my parents were working class

47:53.914 --> 47:55.524
and moved to middle-class area.

47:55.568 --> 47:59.267
- It's about social class.
- No, it's not.

48:00.965 --> 48:03.881
It turns you on that I like
pedestrian stuff, doesn't it?

48:21.420 --> 48:23.596
To be given Judy Blume's
new book was like

48:23.639 --> 48:26.642
going from sitting in the
stands to hitting a home run.

48:28.166 --> 48:29.907
I felt lucky to
be on the inside.

48:32.779 --> 48:34.955
- Well?
- I like it.

48:34.999 --> 48:36.478
Really?

48:36.522 --> 48:37.871
But what do you make of it?

48:39.307 --> 48:41.092
I'm not sure what you mean.

48:41.135 --> 48:42.615
Well, it's not a
kid's book, is it?

48:42.658 --> 48:46.271
No, no. It's about
kids for grownups.

48:46.314 --> 48:47.750
It's about female friendship.

48:47.794 --> 48:51.929
But will adults buy a book
about kids? Can I sell it?

48:55.541 --> 48:58.936
Lots of books have child
protagonists, "Oliver Twist".

48:58.979 --> 49:02.548
This is not Oliver Twist,
but you would buy it?

49:03.549 --> 49:04.376
I would.

49:06.682 --> 49:07.640
Many people would.

49:09.555 --> 49:10.991
There's the nostalgia factor.

49:11.035 --> 49:13.689
You know, my entire generation
grew up on Judy Blume.

49:15.169 --> 49:17.171
- Maybe.
- Definitely.

49:21.480 --> 49:23.351
All right, you've had your fun.

49:27.921 --> 49:30.532
I've put new tapes on your desk.

49:30.576 --> 49:31.490
Close the door.

49:44.285 --> 49:47.549
Judy, Margaret's expecting you.

49:49.377 --> 49:50.204
Coffee?

49:51.684 --> 49:53.381
That's very exciting. Yes.

49:54.687 --> 49:56.123
What is it?

49:56.167 --> 49:57.690
- Judy Blume's here.
- Shit.

49:59.170 --> 50:00.910
Michael, hold on one second.

50:02.042 --> 50:03.609
That's today?

50:03.652 --> 50:05.176
I thought we had more time.

50:06.220 --> 50:08.135
She's going to blow
this, isn't she?

50:08.179 --> 50:09.006
I think so.

50:10.877 --> 50:14.489
Hey, we've been renovating,
moving everything around

50:14.533 --> 50:18.319
which is why your books are
down there and out of order.

50:19.364 --> 50:20.539
Don't worry about it.

50:20.582 --> 50:22.149
I'm Joanna, I'm
Margaret's new assistant.

50:22.193 --> 50:24.325
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

50:24.369 --> 50:25.848
That's very sweet of you.

50:25.892 --> 50:27.241
Really nice to meet you.

50:27.285 --> 50:30.940
Judy, how lovely to see
you. Come into my office.

51:01.928 --> 51:06.715
Joanna, why don't you
answer your phone?

51:06.759 --> 51:09.327
There's someone at the
reception who wants to see you.

51:09.370 --> 51:10.197
Me?

51:18.901 --> 51:21.339
- Are you Joanna Rakoff?
- Yes.

51:21.382 --> 51:22.557
Is that your real name?

51:22.601 --> 51:23.993
'Cause it's so ridiculous,
it sounds fake.

51:26.605 --> 51:29.390
You have no right to keep my
letter from J.D. Salinger.

51:29.434 --> 51:31.436
I'm sorry. Who are you?

51:31.479 --> 51:33.394
Because of you, I'm
going to fail English.

51:33.438 --> 51:34.395
Is everything all right here?

51:34.439 --> 51:35.570
- No.
- Yes. Yes.

51:35.614 --> 51:36.441
No.

51:37.833 --> 51:39.139
Why don't we go downstairs
and get a coffee, okay?

51:40.140 --> 51:40.967
Joanna.

51:43.796 --> 51:45.537
Aren't you supposed
to be in school?

51:45.580 --> 51:46.755
Who do you think you are?

51:46.799 --> 51:49.106
It's my job here to
answer Jerry's mail.

51:49.149 --> 51:52.805
Oh, it's Jerry to you.
Is he your sugar daddy?

51:52.848 --> 51:56.374
No, I've never
even met him, okay?

51:56.417 --> 51:59.116
Mr. Salinger does not
want to receive his mail.

51:59.159 --> 52:01.640
So instead you lecture
me like you're my mother.

52:02.989 --> 52:05.296
You're right, okay?

52:05.339 --> 52:08.473
I'm sorry. I apologize.

52:08.516 --> 52:09.909
Your letter was different

52:09.952 --> 52:11.563
and I thought you
deserved a real response

52:11.606 --> 52:13.173
instead of our, I'm sorry,

52:13.217 --> 52:16.220
we can not pass along
your kind note bullshit.

52:16.263 --> 52:18.178
So I wrote you
something more personal.

52:20.049 --> 52:21.616
What makes you think
your advice is better

52:21.660 --> 52:23.140
than some bullshit response?

52:26.317 --> 52:27.709
I'm going to summer school.

52:28.667 --> 52:30.843
So thanks a lot, Ms. Rakoff

52:46.075 --> 52:48.339
You sent a personal
letter to one of the fans

52:48.382 --> 52:49.905
and she came storming in here?

52:53.257 --> 52:54.171
Oh my gosh.

52:56.129 --> 52:57.043
Oh my gosh.

52:59.219 --> 53:01.569
Do you have any
idea how many times

53:01.613 --> 53:03.180
when I was answering
Salinger's letters

53:03.223 --> 53:04.877
I wanted to write
my own one back?

53:05.878 --> 53:07.923
- Really?
- Of course.

53:07.967 --> 53:10.578
"Dear Sir, obsess
over another writer.

53:10.622 --> 53:13.146
I hear Kurt Vonnegut
answers his own fan mail."

53:14.060 --> 53:15.409
I mean sometimes
you just wanna go,

53:15.453 --> 53:16.889
"Hey, loser."

53:18.238 --> 53:23.025
And then others,
they're so engaging.

53:23.069 --> 53:25.593
You just want to
champion them, you know?

53:25.637 --> 53:27.073
Yes, yes, exactly.

53:30.337 --> 53:32.296
But you've crossed the line.

53:32.339 --> 53:36.517
It's a huge rabbit hole
ethically and legally.

53:36.561 --> 53:38.780
I'm taking you off
Salinger's mail.

53:38.824 --> 53:41.043
No, no, Hugh, please?

53:41.087 --> 53:42.349
I love these letters so much,

53:42.393 --> 53:44.743
I promise you this won't
happen again, I promise.

53:46.092 --> 53:46.919
Judy?

53:52.490 --> 53:54.056
- It's all over.
- Judy?

53:54.100 --> 53:57.059
- She's leaving us.
- For whom?

53:57.103 --> 53:58.539
Does it matter?

53:58.583 --> 54:00.237
I were Judy, I
would have left too.

54:01.499 --> 54:02.326
Joanna.

54:03.718 --> 54:04.545
Why?

54:06.765 --> 54:08.897
Tell me, I'm curious.
Why would you leave?

54:08.941 --> 54:10.247
No, I'm really, really sorry.

54:10.290 --> 54:12.292
I didn't mean that, I just...

54:12.336 --> 54:16.078
I'm just sad to see
her leave, that's all.

54:16.122 --> 54:19.647
Well, until you can
articulate a reason

54:19.691 --> 54:21.083
that will enlighten us,

54:21.127 --> 54:23.521
you can go back to
typing your dictation

54:23.564 --> 54:26.915
and fetch Daniel's
prescriptions when you're done.

54:29.396 --> 54:30.267
Close the door.

54:51.462 --> 54:53.115
Okay, you think that
when a man falls in love

54:53.159 --> 54:55.248
he doesn't look at
another woman, hm?

54:55.292 --> 54:57.598
But I have news for you,
every man in this world

54:57.642 --> 55:00.297
is looking at every
woman in this world
and deciding whether or not-

55:00.340 --> 55:01.994
He wants to fuck her.

55:02.908 --> 55:05.127
She's sexy, right?

55:06.346 --> 55:09.436
Don, I think you
might be in a hole.

55:09.480 --> 55:10.829
You maybe wanna stop digging.

55:10.872 --> 55:13.919
You think women don't
look at other men? We do.

55:13.962 --> 55:15.312
We even look at other women.

55:16.487 --> 55:18.837
We just don't drool
while we do it.

55:21.448 --> 55:26.453
Booba, booba. I drool
exclusively for you.

55:29.021 --> 55:30.805
- Hey.
- White wine?

55:30.849 --> 55:33.460
No, thanks. I'm gonna go.

55:36.376 --> 55:41.468
I know, I actually
came to give you this.

55:41.512 --> 55:44.079
What's this?
It's from Karl.

55:44.123 --> 55:46.995
He's coming to
Washington for a concert.

55:47.039 --> 55:48.345
He really wants you to go.

55:49.476 --> 55:51.391
You've been in touch with Karl?

55:51.435 --> 55:53.785
He wrote you a letter
but you never answered.

55:59.225 --> 56:01.793
- Wednesday in DC.
- Yeah.

56:04.448 --> 56:05.318
What is it?

56:06.275 --> 56:07.842
Someone should go to the meeting

56:07.886 --> 56:10.410
in Washington with
Clifford Bradbury.

56:10.454 --> 56:11.890
Make sure that he's prepared,

56:11.933 --> 56:14.501
and walk them to the
agency's protocol.

56:16.547 --> 56:18.418
He did sound jittery
on the phone.

56:19.724 --> 56:22.509
I can't leave New York,
but I suppose I could send-

56:22.553 --> 56:23.380
Me!

56:24.468 --> 56:25.338
- You?
- Me.

56:27.558 --> 56:28.385
Why?

56:29.690 --> 56:31.953
Take notes and assist Clifford.

56:33.477 --> 56:35.261
Just let me do this
for the agency.

56:39.134 --> 56:41.485
You are to go to Washington,

56:41.528 --> 56:43.617
be the agency's eyes and ears.

56:43.661 --> 56:45.880
Find out who this
Clifford person is.

56:45.924 --> 56:47.404
You are to meet
with him beforehand

56:47.447 --> 56:48.622
and debrief him afterward.

56:48.666 --> 56:50.929
But you are not to
meet with Jerry.

56:50.972 --> 56:53.932
Jerry must think they
are meeting on their
own, understood?

56:54.889 --> 56:56.456
You will not regret this.

56:56.500 --> 56:57.588
We'll see about that.

57:02.027 --> 57:02.854
Hey!

57:04.943 --> 57:07.685
I've got a gift for you.

57:07.728 --> 57:09.426
My birthday was two months ago.

57:11.166 --> 57:12.907
Well, birthdays
are for Hallmark.

57:14.082 --> 57:16.433
It's, it's my novel.

57:18.478 --> 57:19.348
You finished it?

57:21.002 --> 57:22.047
Don't you wanna read it?

57:23.614 --> 57:25.006
Oh, of course I do.

57:26.834 --> 57:27.879
Thanks.

57:30.098 --> 57:30.925
Congrats!

58:05.438 --> 58:06.308
Mr. Bradbury?

58:07.396 --> 58:08.310
Yes. Joanna?

58:08.354 --> 58:10.095
- Hi.
- Hi.

58:10.138 --> 58:11.749
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

58:11.792 --> 58:14.839
I've widened the spine see,
to give the book some length

58:14.882 --> 58:16.057
because it's too thin.

58:16.884 --> 58:18.886
I also retyped it all
from the New Yorker.

58:18.930 --> 58:20.671
I didn't scan it
and good thing too,

58:20.714 --> 58:22.586
because there were
a few small typos.

58:23.848 --> 58:25.632
New Yorker doesn't make typos.

58:25.676 --> 58:28.766
Oh yes, small ones
but typos still.

58:28.809 --> 58:31.377
Salinger is such a
stickler for details.

58:31.420 --> 58:33.727
- I made two mock-ups.
- Wow.

58:33.771 --> 58:35.468
Do you think I should
have made more?

58:35.512 --> 58:36.774
No.

58:36.817 --> 58:39.124
Oh, I think I should've
made more, yeah.

58:39.167 --> 58:42.214
Mr. Bradbury, it's
gonna go very well.

58:42.257 --> 58:44.303
Just forget everything
that you've heard

58:44.346 --> 58:45.870
about Mr. Salinger.

58:45.913 --> 58:48.307
I think that you'll find that
he's very straightforward.

58:48.350 --> 58:50.439
It's important that
you just be yourself.

1:00:20.704 --> 1:00:21.835
What happened?

1:00:23.184 --> 1:00:25.709
Jerry Salinger
paid for my lunch.

1:00:25.752 --> 1:00:26.753
But how did it go?

1:00:28.450 --> 1:00:31.018
- We agreed on everything.
- That's great.

1:00:33.934 --> 1:00:35.414
Because I just
missed him then, huh?

1:00:35.457 --> 1:00:38.156
- Except the typos.
- What do you mean?

1:00:38.199 --> 1:00:40.158
He did not want me
to correct them.

1:00:40.201 --> 1:00:42.334
Yeah, he seemed peeved
that I fixed them.

1:00:42.377 --> 1:00:43.683
You know, I thought
at one point he'd say

1:00:43.727 --> 1:00:45.642
let's just forget the
whole thing, you know?

1:00:45.685 --> 1:00:46.555
Did he say why?

1:00:48.122 --> 1:00:50.211
He wants it printed exactly
as it ran in the New Yorker

1:00:50.255 --> 1:00:52.953
as if the typos were
actually intentional,

1:00:52.997 --> 1:00:54.781
it makes no sense.

1:00:54.825 --> 1:00:58.306
Hey, don't fix any more typos.

1:00:58.350 --> 1:00:59.960
Don't tell anybody
about the book.

1:01:00.004 --> 1:01:01.092
No interviews.

1:01:01.135 --> 1:01:02.876
That would ruin the whole deal.

1:01:02.920 --> 1:01:05.444
Yeah, we don't want to do that.

1:01:05.487 --> 1:01:06.706
Great work, Mr. Bradbury.

1:01:06.750 --> 1:01:08.708
My boss is going to
be very pleased, okay?

1:01:09.840 --> 1:01:10.667
Bye.

1:01:59.628 --> 1:02:00.455
- Jo!
- Hi.

1:02:05.547 --> 1:02:07.375
You got my invitation.

1:02:08.202 --> 1:02:09.029
Yeah.

1:02:11.031 --> 1:02:15.079
I'm so glad you're
here. You look great.

1:02:15.122 --> 1:02:15.949
So do you.

1:02:23.304 --> 1:02:24.305
I'm glad you're here, Jo.

1:02:24.349 --> 1:02:25.916
I've been wanting
to go apologize.

1:02:26.873 --> 1:02:27.744
What?

1:02:29.006 --> 1:02:30.921
I was angry when I
sent you the letter.

1:02:30.964 --> 1:02:32.792
I wrote stuff I didn't mean.

1:02:32.836 --> 1:02:34.881
No, don't apologize.
You should be angry.

1:02:34.925 --> 1:02:38.145
I'm angry at you for
not being angry at me.

1:02:38.189 --> 1:02:41.627
Well, I'm not angry and
that's absurd by the way.

1:02:44.673 --> 1:02:47.807
You hurt me, and I
needed to unleash.

1:02:47.851 --> 1:02:51.115
I deserved a proper
breakup, you know?

1:02:52.812 --> 1:02:54.161
"Karl, I'm leaving you."

1:02:55.293 --> 1:02:56.120
The usual stuff.

1:03:00.341 --> 1:03:01.473
The usual stuff.

1:03:03.170 --> 1:03:05.129
felt
depressing when you left.

1:03:07.653 --> 1:03:09.742
I didn't read, I didn't
read your letter.

1:03:11.048 --> 1:03:11.875
Why?

1:03:16.401 --> 1:03:17.837
I couldn't make it past Jo.

1:03:20.405 --> 1:03:21.841
Nobody else calls me Jo, so...

1:03:25.889 --> 1:03:28.065
I want you back in my life.

1:03:29.370 --> 1:03:31.546
You know, even if
it's just a phone call

1:03:31.590 --> 1:03:32.983
every once in a while.

1:03:34.158 --> 1:03:36.073
You were my best friend.

1:03:38.858 --> 1:03:40.077
I miss you, Jo.

1:04:10.237 --> 1:04:11.717
I miss you too.

1:04:52.932 --> 1:04:56.544
- I've learned that as
phony as it may be,

1:04:56.588 --> 1:04:58.242
you can't go around revealing

1:04:58.285 --> 1:05:01.027
your goddamn emotions
to the world.

1:05:01.071 --> 1:05:02.811
Most people don't
give a flying hoot

1:05:02.855 --> 1:05:04.552
about like what you think

1:05:04.596 --> 1:05:07.425
and feel most of
the time, I guess.

1:05:08.948 --> 1:05:10.471
And if they see a weakness,

1:05:10.515 --> 1:05:15.085
I mean why for God's sake is
showing emotion a weakness?

1:05:16.260 --> 1:05:18.436
Boy, do they jump
all over you, right?

1:05:20.003 --> 1:05:22.788
They seem to get right
in your goddamn face

1:05:22.831 --> 1:05:25.747
and revel in the fact

1:05:25.791 --> 1:05:27.880
that you are actually
feeling something.

1:05:33.538 --> 1:05:34.365
Is it good?

1:05:36.149 --> 1:05:36.976
What?

1:05:37.020 --> 1:05:38.499
The manuscript, is it good?

1:05:41.807 --> 1:05:42.808
It's interesting.

1:05:44.070 --> 1:05:45.245
But you hate it?

1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:50.947
I don't hate it, or
maybe I do hate it

1:05:53.471 --> 1:05:54.776
and that's why it's good.

1:05:56.778 --> 1:05:58.955
- It's weirdly addictive.
- But?

1:06:00.130 --> 1:06:02.219
I don't want to read
about his sex life.

1:06:02.262 --> 1:06:04.090
No one wants to read
about his sex life.

1:06:06.701 --> 1:06:08.965
Maybe I'm just annoyed
by his nonchalance.

1:06:10.879 --> 1:06:11.706
Or because?

1:06:17.321 --> 1:06:18.670
He's writing and I'm not.

1:06:53.922 --> 1:06:54.749
I understand.

1:07:01.843 --> 1:07:02.714
What's going on?

1:07:03.802 --> 1:07:06.413
Well, keep us posted
and thank you.

1:07:14.508 --> 1:07:16.032
Apparently he shot himself.

1:07:17.685 --> 1:07:19.165
Wait, who, who shot himself?

1:07:19.209 --> 1:07:22.951
Daniel, Joanna. Daniel
committed suicide.

1:07:24.344 --> 1:07:25.171
The Daniel?

1:07:26.607 --> 1:07:30.350
In the living room while
Margaret was in the bedroom.

1:07:30.394 --> 1:07:32.091
This can't be right.

1:07:32.135 --> 1:07:33.658
Daniel is a beautiful man.

1:07:33.701 --> 1:07:35.573
He's sweet, he's kind.

1:07:37.879 --> 1:07:40.491
This can't be happening.

1:07:40.534 --> 1:07:42.101
But he looked fine.

1:07:42.145 --> 1:07:45.757
He was bipolar, Margaret took
care of him all these years.

1:07:45.800 --> 1:07:47.106
He was her brother?

1:07:47.150 --> 1:07:50.414
Lover, for 20 years.

1:07:52.242 --> 1:07:54.592
Wait, are we talking
about the same Daniel?

1:07:54.635 --> 1:07:57.377
Daniel was married to
Helen whom you've met.

1:07:57.421 --> 1:07:59.771
He lived half the
week with Helen

1:07:59.814 --> 1:08:01.903
and the other half
with Margaret.

1:08:01.947 --> 1:08:04.950
They shared his care.

1:08:06.169 --> 1:08:07.344
They shared him.

1:08:11.130 --> 1:08:13.959
Margaret shared a man
with another woman?

1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:18.094
Joanna, if anyone calls, tell
them she's working from home

1:08:18.137 --> 1:08:19.095
and take a message,

1:08:19.138 --> 1:08:22.620
and no mention of this.

1:08:22.663 --> 1:08:23.925
What about if it's Jerry?

1:08:23.969 --> 1:08:26.102
Especially, if it's Jerry.

1:08:54.478 --> 1:08:58.090
Can you please do
that some other time?

1:08:58.134 --> 1:08:58.960
Fine.

1:09:03.487 --> 1:09:04.314
Thanks.

1:09:28.338 --> 1:09:30.731
Margaret's office,
Joanna speaking.

1:09:30.775 --> 1:09:32.994
Hi, Joanna, it's
Jerry. How are you?

1:09:33.038 --> 1:09:34.866
- Hi. I'm well, how are you?

1:09:35.780 --> 1:09:36.998
- How's the weather down there?

1:09:37.042 --> 1:09:38.174
- Muggy.

1:09:38.217 --> 1:09:39.827
- Is your boss around?

1:09:39.871 --> 1:09:41.960
- No, I'm afraid she's out.

1:09:42.003 --> 1:09:43.875
She's been out a lot lately.

1:09:44.789 --> 1:09:48.662
Yeah, she's very busy.
Lots of meetings.

1:09:49.663 --> 1:09:51.752
Is there anything I
can help you with?

1:09:51.796 --> 1:09:53.014
- Let me ask you something.

1:09:53.058 --> 1:09:57.236
This Clifford Bradbury fellow.

1:09:57.280 --> 1:09:58.106
- Sure.

1:09:58.150 --> 1:09:59.325
what do you make of him?

1:09:59.369 --> 1:10:00.979
- I like him.

1:10:01.022 --> 1:10:02.850
Sometimes I think he
can overthink things,

1:10:02.894 --> 1:10:05.549
but he just doesn't
wanna let you down.

1:10:06.854 --> 1:10:09.205
- Have you been writing every
day?

1:10:09.248 --> 1:10:11.032
A lot of days.

1:10:11.076 --> 1:10:13.252
They've given me more
responsibility around here.

1:10:13.296 --> 1:10:15.863
So I've been
reading manuscripts.

1:10:17.038 --> 1:10:19.867
- You're a writer,
Joanna, aren't you?

1:10:19.911 --> 1:10:23.219
Not an agent, not a secretary?

1:10:25.003 --> 1:10:25.830
- I don't know.

1:10:27.135 --> 1:10:29.573
- Sorry, I missed that.
I'm a little bit deaf.

1:10:31.096 --> 1:10:33.229
- Yes. Yes.

1:10:35.100 --> 1:10:36.623
- I'm a writer.

1:10:36.667 --> 1:10:41.237
- To write, even if it's just
15 minutes in the morning,

1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:44.065
protect that sanctuary, okay?

1:10:44.109 --> 1:10:47.547
Don't get stuck answering
the phone, Joanna.

1:10:47.591 --> 1:10:48.418
You're a poet.

1:11:34.812 --> 1:11:36.901
What's it like working
for the New Yorker?

1:11:38.119 --> 1:11:40.426
Well, why don't you come
by the office one day,

1:11:40.470 --> 1:11:41.558
we'll show you around.

1:11:43.299 --> 1:11:44.604
I would like that very much.

1:11:45.475 --> 1:11:46.737
Do you write yourself?

1:11:49.392 --> 1:11:52.003
It's okay, we won't
tell your boss.

1:11:53.004 --> 1:11:55.136
I published two poems
in the Paris Review,

1:11:55.180 --> 1:11:57.269
I'm working on
some new material.

1:11:58.139 --> 1:12:00.316
Well, we'd be happy to take
a look at your material

1:12:00.359 --> 1:12:01.665
when you feel it's ready.

1:12:02.753 --> 1:12:05.277
That would be great. That
would be really great.

1:12:06.278 --> 1:12:07.671
- Well, let's cheers to that.
- Okay.

1:12:08.672 --> 1:12:10.717
It's satirical stuff I like.

1:12:10.761 --> 1:12:13.329
I know, but the New
Yorker's fiction is a joke

1:12:13.372 --> 1:12:17.594
and that soppy talk of the
town thing,

1:12:17.637 --> 1:12:18.421
Don.

1:12:18.464 --> 1:12:20.074
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:12:20.118 --> 1:12:21.424
I know you love that shit, that,

1:12:21.467 --> 1:12:23.730
"Oh, let's all go meet
up at the Algonquin.

1:12:23.774 --> 1:12:26.733
I do so wish you can
join us" bullshit.

1:12:30.650 --> 1:12:31.825
So when's the wedding?

1:12:37.309 --> 1:12:40.268
It's Columbus Day
weekend, right?

1:12:40.312 --> 1:12:42.619
Or am I making that up?

1:12:43.533 --> 1:12:45.404
It's next weekend, Don.

1:12:45.448 --> 1:12:47.014
Joanna, you're coming, right?

1:12:48.102 --> 1:12:50.017
Yeah, yeah. Exciting.

1:12:53.673 --> 1:12:55.762
You're an asshole.
You know that, right?

1:13:01.202 --> 1:13:03.074
I knew that if I told you
about it, you'd start planning

1:13:03.117 --> 1:13:06.120
like let's rent a car,
let's stay in this B&B.

1:13:06.164 --> 1:13:07.121
What am I gonna wear?

1:13:07.165 --> 1:13:08.775
And then you'd buy that dress

1:13:08.819 --> 1:13:10.081
and you'd make all these plans,

1:13:10.124 --> 1:13:11.517
and then you'd flip out
at me when I told you

1:13:11.561 --> 1:13:12.953
that I wanted to go alone.

1:13:17.393 --> 1:13:19.917
You wanna go to your best
friend's wedding alone?

1:13:20.874 --> 1:13:23.834
Listen, I don't need to justify
myself to you, all right?

1:13:23.877 --> 1:13:26.097
- Really?
- Really, booba.

1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:27.925
All my bros from Hartford
are gonna be there.

1:13:27.968 --> 1:13:29.274
It's gonna be the end of an era,

1:13:29.317 --> 1:13:30.667
and I don't wanna have to worry

1:13:30.710 --> 1:13:32.625
about whether you're
having fun or not.

1:13:37.369 --> 1:13:40.633
Right, maybe you'll
meet some hot blonde

1:13:40.677 --> 1:13:41.939
that wants you to
rip her panties off

1:13:41.982 --> 1:13:43.506
and fuck her up the ass

1:13:43.549 --> 1:13:45.551
and write an unreadable
story about her.

1:13:46.552 --> 1:13:49.120
What, where's this coming from?

1:13:49.163 --> 1:13:51.383
Where is the sweet naive
girl I met last Christmas,

1:13:51.427 --> 1:13:53.690
'cause you know what, I'd
like her back, please booba.

1:13:53.733 --> 1:13:55.953
Stop calling me, booba, okay?

1:13:55.996 --> 1:13:57.389
I'm not a child.

1:13:57.433 --> 1:13:59.391
I call you booba
because I love you.

1:14:00.261 --> 1:14:02.220
It's what my grandmother
calls my mom.

1:14:05.266 --> 1:14:06.833
- You love me?
- Of course.

1:14:08.008 --> 1:14:09.793
I mean, would I be
here if I didn't?

1:14:11.142 --> 1:14:12.752
I told you I've never
lived with a girl before,

1:14:12.796 --> 1:14:13.710
you changed me.

1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:20.064
You love me, but
you don't want me
to go to Mark's wedding?

1:14:20.107 --> 1:14:21.369
Correct.

1:14:29.465 --> 1:14:31.379
Look, I am older than you.

1:14:31.423 --> 1:14:34.818
I try not to remind you of
this, but it is true, all right?

1:14:34.861 --> 1:14:36.297
And one day when you are my age,

1:14:36.341 --> 1:14:37.777
you will realize that two
people can love each other

1:14:37.821 --> 1:14:39.997
and not agree on everything,

1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:41.999
and not have to do
everything together.

1:14:58.972 --> 1:15:01.714
Do you think I
should pack a tie?

1:15:04.108 --> 1:15:06.023
Booba? You're good with
this kind of thing.

1:15:06.066 --> 1:15:09.592
Like I don't even have
a suit, so you think,

1:15:09.635 --> 1:15:12.159
you think just the
shirt and a tie?

1:15:14.814 --> 1:15:15.772
You're depressed.

1:15:18.122 --> 1:15:20.907
I swear, I mean I
recognize the symptoms.

1:15:20.951 --> 1:15:22.692
I get like that
when I'm emotional.

1:15:23.780 --> 1:15:26.565
Well, I can get quite emotional.

1:15:28.306 --> 1:15:29.307
I'm not depressed.

1:15:31.701 --> 1:15:32.919
I'm a very happy person.

1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:34.747
What?

1:15:36.357 --> 1:15:37.184
Nothing.

1:15:43.626 --> 1:15:45.062
Getting a kiss goodbye?

1:15:54.288 --> 1:15:59.293
All right, goodbye Joanna.

1:16:27.931 --> 1:16:29.410
I think about Holden a lot.

1:16:30.716 --> 1:16:31.587
When I first think about him,

1:16:31.630 --> 1:16:33.763
I get a stupid grin on my face.

1:16:33.806 --> 1:16:38.115
You know, thinking about what
a funny guy he is and all.

1:16:38.158 --> 1:16:40.770
Then I usually get
depressed as hell

1:16:41.814 --> 1:16:43.294
because I only
think about Holden

1:16:43.337 --> 1:16:45.252
when I'm feeling very emotional.

1:16:47.211 --> 1:16:49.300
I can get quiet emotional.

1:16:55.959 --> 1:16:59.484
That's what I had
become, quiet emotional.

1:17:12.323 --> 1:17:13.803
Dear boy from Winston-Salem.

1:17:15.761 --> 1:17:19.635
My most profound apologies
for taking so long to reply.

1:17:20.984 --> 1:17:23.464
I've been thinking about
your letters for months.

1:17:24.770 --> 1:17:25.641
I suppose that

1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:31.516
I too can get quite emotional
about things sometimes.

1:17:34.737 --> 1:17:35.563
But you're right.

1:17:37.435 --> 1:17:40.438
Can't go around revealing your
goddamn emotions to the world

1:17:41.961 --> 1:17:45.356
but if you can't reveal
your emotions to the world,

1:17:45.399 --> 1:17:47.575
then what are you
supposed to do with them?

1:17:47.619 --> 1:17:48.489
How do you go on?

1:17:51.188 --> 1:17:54.452
'Cause I feel like
crying all the time.

1:18:46.765 --> 1:18:49.072
Joanna, what is it?

1:18:49.115 --> 1:18:50.726
Has something happened
at the agency?

1:18:50.769 --> 1:18:52.423
No, no, no, everything's fine.

1:18:54.164 --> 1:18:57.558
I brought you these, and
some soup from Mangia.

1:18:57.602 --> 1:18:59.430
I know you like their
mushroom barley.

1:19:00.518 --> 1:19:01.737
That's very thoughtful.

1:19:03.434 --> 1:19:05.175
You do pay attention, don't you?

1:19:19.624 --> 1:19:22.279
You did a fine job
on those contracts.

1:19:23.628 --> 1:19:25.804
Those electronic clauses,

1:19:26.936 --> 1:19:28.676
they'll be the
death of publishing.

1:19:31.462 --> 1:19:32.724
On the other hand,

1:19:32.768 --> 1:19:35.161
engaging with Jerry's
fans was irresponsible,

1:19:35.205 --> 1:19:37.337
immature and dangerous.

1:19:37.381 --> 1:19:38.425
You know about that?

1:19:38.469 --> 1:19:40.819
I have fired
assistants for less.

1:19:42.125 --> 1:19:44.083
Why didn't you fire me?

1:19:44.127 --> 1:19:45.781
Because it's highly unlikely

1:19:45.824 --> 1:19:48.305
you will make the
same mistake twice.

1:19:48.348 --> 1:19:49.828
Also Jerry likes you.

1:19:49.872 --> 1:19:53.179
I am reluctant to
alter his routine.

1:19:53.223 --> 1:19:54.702
I don't wanna be a routine.

1:20:03.189 --> 1:20:07.846
I have a couple of stories
from long-term clients.

1:20:09.413 --> 1:20:14.026
Read them, and figure
out which magazines

1:20:14.070 --> 1:20:16.724
they'd be right for,
and send them out.

1:20:22.513 --> 1:20:23.731
What if I don't like them?

1:20:23.775 --> 1:20:25.821
Then it's your job to
figure out who will.

1:20:26.734 --> 1:20:27.561
Right.

1:20:28.867 --> 1:20:29.694
Thank you.

1:20:32.392 --> 1:20:33.872
Better get back to the office.

1:20:35.004 --> 1:20:36.832
Why do you think
Judy Blume left?

1:20:38.268 --> 1:20:39.835
I'm sorry that I said that.

1:20:39.878 --> 1:20:41.184
No, please.

1:20:41.227 --> 1:20:44.274
I would like to
know what you think.

1:20:55.415 --> 1:20:59.767
When you met with Judy, did
you discuss her writing?

1:21:00.594 --> 1:21:03.467
The quality of her writing
was never an issue.

1:21:05.382 --> 1:21:08.907
Maybe she wasn't looking
for the perfect sales pitch.

1:21:10.604 --> 1:21:14.782
Maybe she just wanted
to hear what you thought

1:21:14.826 --> 1:21:17.960
about the story,
what it meant to you,

1:21:20.049 --> 1:21:22.747
or if you love books the
same way that she loves them.

1:21:24.227 --> 1:21:25.706
I'm not sure my love of books

1:21:25.750 --> 1:21:27.795
was relevant to that discussion.

1:21:28.840 --> 1:21:30.450
Maybe it was relevant to her.

1:21:34.237 --> 1:21:35.455
I know it would be to me.

1:21:37.631 --> 1:21:38.458
Oh.

1:21:41.766 --> 1:21:46.379
You know, I sold my first
book when I was in my 20s.

1:21:46.423 --> 1:21:48.425
It was about this
young woman journalist

1:21:48.468 --> 1:21:50.035
in the Spanish Civil War,

1:21:50.079 --> 1:21:52.908
and it was actually
written by a man.

1:21:54.126 --> 1:21:58.217
And yet he seemed to
understand intimately

1:21:58.261 --> 1:22:01.046
what it would be like
for her as a woman.

1:22:01.090 --> 1:22:04.049
Anyway, I sold the book,

1:22:04.093 --> 1:22:08.924
and then my boss said that I
should represent the author.

1:22:08.967 --> 1:22:11.230
And naturally I said, yes.

1:22:11.274 --> 1:22:12.753
And then like right away,

1:22:12.797 --> 1:22:16.496
I started to get
nervous, almost panicky.

1:22:17.584 --> 1:22:22.111
And what if, what if the author
disappointed me as a person?

1:22:23.764 --> 1:22:25.941
And what if I liked the
writing, but not him?

1:22:27.986 --> 1:22:29.640
You know, it was about
three weeks later

1:22:29.683 --> 1:22:33.078
we met for lunch at Elaine's,

1:22:33.122 --> 1:22:36.690
and at 9:00 PM, we
were still there,

1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:42.305
just laughing and
talking and sharing

1:22:42.348 --> 1:22:45.134
our aspirations and
our love of music

1:22:48.006 --> 1:22:49.312
and our love of books.

1:22:53.098 --> 1:22:53.969
Daniel?

1:22:56.449 --> 1:22:57.276
Yeah.

1:22:59.017 --> 1:22:59.844
Daniel.

1:23:09.114 --> 1:23:10.507
My condolences, Margaret.

1:23:11.551 --> 1:23:13.336
I'll pull my socks up.

1:23:18.863 --> 1:23:19.690
Oh.

1:23:59.077 --> 1:24:02.907
For months, I had been
touched by anonymous fans.

1:24:02.950 --> 1:24:05.736
Touched by their desire
to connect with Salinger.

1:24:08.217 --> 1:24:09.957
Their letters had changed me.

1:24:13.918 --> 1:24:16.877
The time had come to see for
myself what had moved them.

1:24:32.980 --> 1:24:37.724
Salinger's nothing like
I thought, nothing.

1:24:39.248 --> 1:24:44.253
He's brutal, brutal and
funny. And I love it.

1:24:44.470 --> 1:24:46.211
I love Franny the most.

1:24:47.473 --> 1:24:49.736
There's that moment when
the guy in Princeton

1:24:49.780 --> 1:24:51.912
is waiting for Franny
at the train station,

1:24:51.956 --> 1:24:55.655
and he has the letter in
his pocket, Franny's letter.

1:24:55.699 --> 1:24:59.572
And he's read it a thousand
times, he knows it by heart.

1:24:59.616 --> 1:25:03.402
But when she gets off
the train and asks,

1:25:03.446 --> 1:25:05.361
"Did you get my letter?"

1:25:05.404 --> 1:25:07.624
- He says,
- "Which letter?"

1:27:06.264 --> 1:27:07.352
Hey, booba.

1:27:09.398 --> 1:27:10.834
Thought you'd be at work.

1:27:12.270 --> 1:27:13.489
I took the morning off.

1:27:16.013 --> 1:27:17.493
I missed you, booba.

1:27:30.593 --> 1:27:31.594
Are you going somewhere?

1:27:33.596 --> 1:27:34.771
I'm leaving you, Don.

1:27:41.343 --> 1:27:43.040
I get it. This is
about the wedding.

1:27:43.083 --> 1:27:44.563
Something hit me
while you were gone.

1:27:44.607 --> 1:27:46.261
Why are you making
a thing out of this?

1:27:46.304 --> 1:27:48.088
Listen to me, something
hit me while you were gone.

1:27:48.132 --> 1:27:49.568
But they were never
really engaged.

1:27:49.612 --> 1:27:51.309
I didn't miss you.
What?

1:27:51.353 --> 1:27:53.616
I didn't think about
you, not for one second.

1:27:55.357 --> 1:27:58.751
Okay, so you needed some
time on your own. I get that.

1:27:58.795 --> 1:27:59.622
You can keep the
apartment, all right?

1:27:59.665 --> 1:28:01.188
You need it more than I do.

1:28:01.232 --> 1:28:02.581
You're gonna give me
the, sorry, it's not you,

1:28:02.625 --> 1:28:04.583
it's me bullshit?

1:28:04.627 --> 1:28:06.977
I should have broke
up with you before.

1:28:07.020 --> 1:28:09.371
I'm not in love
with you. I'm sorry.

1:30:00.786 --> 1:30:02.048
I knew you could do it.

1:30:03.789 --> 1:30:04.964
I knew it!

1:30:05.008 --> 1:30:05.922
Come with me. Hugh!

1:30:07.140 --> 1:30:09.055
Stop doing what you're doing.

1:30:09.099 --> 1:30:11.623
Max, we're coming
into your sanctum.

1:30:11.667 --> 1:30:13.059
I have an announcement to make.

1:30:13.103 --> 1:30:14.365
What is it?

1:30:14.409 --> 1:30:17.281
Joanna has sold a story
I gave her this summer.

1:30:17.324 --> 1:30:19.849
Congratulations.

1:30:19.892 --> 1:30:22.112
Not surprised. Good job.
You're on your way.

1:30:22.155 --> 1:30:23.243
Of course she is.

1:30:23.287 --> 1:30:24.593
I knew the moment you walked

1:30:24.636 --> 1:30:27.160
through the door that
you were agency material.

1:30:27.204 --> 1:30:30.860
Now you can start to build
your very own client list.

1:30:30.903 --> 1:30:33.036
A most exciting
feeling for an agent.

1:30:33.079 --> 1:30:34.733
Isn't that right, Max?

1:30:34.777 --> 1:30:36.692
For once I have to agree
with Margaret, yes.

1:30:36.735 --> 1:30:38.563
We will celebrate at lunch.

1:30:38.607 --> 1:30:40.565
Hope you like martinis.

1:30:40.609 --> 1:30:42.262
Oh, she'll learn to like them.

1:31:21.345 --> 1:31:23.478
You know, we have some authors

1:31:23.521 --> 1:31:26.872
who would prefer to
be with you, I think

1:31:26.916 --> 1:31:28.178
than an old fogy like me.

1:31:29.396 --> 1:31:31.007
Some people I think you'll like.

1:31:34.053 --> 1:31:34.880
What is it?

1:31:35.925 --> 1:31:37.796
I'm so grateful.

1:31:37.840 --> 1:31:39.842
I'm so, so grateful.

1:31:45.412 --> 1:31:46.239
You're leaving.

1:31:47.806 --> 1:31:50.548
I was planning on talking
to you sometime this week.

1:31:50.592 --> 1:31:52.724
But you're doing so well.

1:31:52.768 --> 1:31:56.859
I mean you have it in you to
become a really fine agent.

1:31:57.729 --> 1:32:01.254
You have good
instincts, a good heart.

1:32:01.298 --> 1:32:02.125
Thank you.

1:32:03.953 --> 1:32:04.954
Thank you, Margaret.

1:32:07.478 --> 1:32:08.523
My mind is made up.

1:32:10.133 --> 1:32:13.528
Of course I'll stay until
you can find a replacement.

1:32:16.618 --> 1:32:18.576
You have other aspirations.

1:32:20.491 --> 1:32:21.318
I do.

1:32:23.712 --> 1:32:25.757
We just never really
talked about anything

1:32:26.845 --> 1:32:28.499
other than the
agency's business.

1:32:30.588 --> 1:32:31.546
It's very true.

1:32:38.596 --> 1:32:41.991
But I like working with
you. I like working here.

1:32:42.034 --> 1:32:43.427
I really, really do.

1:32:44.994 --> 1:32:48.214
There's just other
things I want to do.

1:32:48.258 --> 1:32:52.871
And I'm afraid that if I don't
do them now, I never will.

1:32:58.834 --> 1:33:00.009
I understand.

1:34:05.683 --> 1:34:09.252
Hi, Kevin told me to drop
this by at my convenience.

1:34:10.296 --> 1:34:11.776
Would you like to give
it to him yourself?

1:34:11.820 --> 1:34:12.821
I think he's in.

1:34:14.344 --> 1:34:17.260
That would be lovely. Thanks.

1:34:27.662 --> 1:34:30.926
Hey there. Oh, guess
who's visiting.

1:34:56.647 --> 1:34:58.083
Hello?

1:34:58.127 --> 1:35:00.825
Listen, I'm thinking, if I
was the guy who put myself

1:35:00.869 --> 1:35:03.175
on a paper and it came out
as "Catcher In The Rye"

1:35:03.219 --> 1:35:05.569
I'd get a bang out of the
bastard writing me a letter

1:35:05.612 --> 1:35:08.703
pretending to be able to
do the same, follow me?

1:35:57.708 --> 1:36:00.232
Oh, Jerry. May I
introduce you to-

1:36:00.276 --> 1:36:03.018
Joanna, it's so good
to finally meet you.
