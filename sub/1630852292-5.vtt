Unfortunately,
Melinda took a hard hit,

19:43.382 --> 19:45.817
you couldn't continue, so I'll
be seeing you in the Arena.

19:45.817 --> 19:47.920
Casey, you got lucky
and attempted

19:47.920 --> 19:49.655
one more jump than Melinda,

19:49.655 --> 19:52.257
or else you would've been
the one in the Arena.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.526
I don't ever wanna
see you quit again.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.962
I feel like I'm screwed.
I didn't finish

19:56.962 --> 19:58.597
the challenge today
because I'm an asshole,

19:58.597 --> 20:00.699
but I have people

20:00.699 --> 20:04.102
that will keep me
out of this elimination.

20:04.102 --> 20:06.838
TJ: All right.
For the men, Steve,

20:06.838 --> 20:08.607
you lost today's challenge,
unfortunately.

more pissed off at myself.

20:12.311 --> 20:13.812

20:13.812 --> 20:15.914
Go big or go home, and, uh,

20:15.914 --> 20:17.749
I've set myself up
to go home.

20:17.749 --> 20:19.518

for the men,

20:19.518 --> 20:22.087
two guys were seconds apart.

20:22.087 --> 20:23.121
Wow.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.760
And that was Brad and Darrell.

20:29.795 --> 20:31.363
BRAD: Since Darrell and I
are kind of aligned

20:31.363 --> 20:33.432
at this point in the game,
I'm kind of hoping

20:33.432 --> 20:34.866
he wins because, if he does,

20:34.866 --> 20:36.234
he's gotta nominate
four players.

20:36.234 --> 20:37.836
I haven't had
that kind of heat

20:37.836 --> 20:39.271

was Darrell.

the winner...

on the chopping block.

what I wanna do.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.062

that happens.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.203
by winning today's challenge,
you are not only safe

21:11.203 --> 21:13.372
from elimination, but you are
also gonna go back to the villa

21:13.372 --> 21:16.875
and nominate four players,
two of which will be selected

21:16.875 --> 21:19.177
by the rest of the group
to go against our losers.

21:19.177 --> 21:21.713
Brad, Ayanna,
as the life shield holders,

21:21.713 --> 21:24.216
you'll have a chance to save
one of those nominated players.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.752
Up to you.
I'll see you guys at the Arena.

21:26.752 --> 21:29.388

21:29.388 --> 21:32.224
Steve and Melinda lost,
and with them losing,

21:32.224 --> 21:33.925
that means
that we lose two votes,

21:33.925 --> 21:35.761
which also means
that the King's Palace

This is really the one guy
that I got, like,

strong ties to

22:13.899 --> 22:15.500

I'm loyal,

Derrick leaving the game

like, that's real talk.

So at this point, I've got
a little bit of game talk

22:31.249 --> 22:33.151
with Darrell going,
but I'm realizing

22:33.151 --> 22:35.954
that I can now grab one of
the strongest female competitors

in the history of the game

22:38.990 --> 22:40.659

We gotta flush her out.

23:37.849 --> 23:40.452
I have to put in Teck
versus Steve

23:40.452 --> 23:41.887

23:41.887 --> 23:43.555
more than he has mine.
But Ayanna

23:43.555 --> 23:45.290

her life shield to save Teck.

29:44.849 --> 29:47.185
Um, okay, well,
it's kind of tough

29:47.185 --> 29:49.654
because I know that
this is a game.

29:49.654 --> 29:51.289
I do know that
if you keep me around,

29:51.289 --> 29:53.591
I'll be good company.
I'll keep you in laughs

29:53.591 --> 29:55.193

Sorry, Casey.
Don't vote for Tina.

29:58.263 --> 30:00.431
(laughing)

30:00.431 --> 30:03.168
Based on performance,
I am thinking that

30:03.168 --> 30:05.703
a lot of these people would vote
for Casey to go in.

30:05.703 --> 30:09.707
It's me versus Casey,
so I'm sitting golden here.

30:09.707 --> 30:11.709
In the words of Marshawn Lynch,

30:11.709 --> 30:13.778
I'm just here
so I won't get fined.

30:16.047 --> 30:18.316
- That's all you're gonna say?
- I mean,

30:18.316 --> 30:20.151
I don't have
anything else to say.

30:20.151 --> 30:23.021
It just hurts, the news,
that has got me downright upset.

30:23.021 --> 30:24.923
I heard Steve wanna go
against your boy

30:24.923 --> 30:26.424
in the elimination arena.

30:26.424 --> 30:28.960
Bruh, it's Teck,
the brother that brought you

30:28.960 --> 30:30.962
into the alliance.
You living foul

30:30.962 --> 30:33.164
right now, bro.
You're living foul.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.236
All right,
so this is my man.

30:38.236 --> 30:40.038
I-- there's no way
I'm voting against him

30:40.038 --> 30:41.806
in any way, shape, or form.

30:41.806 --> 30:43.374
I'd vote against
every last one

30:43.374 --> 30:45.176
of you motherfuckers
when it comes to this guy.

30:45.176 --> 30:47.245
Tyler. Tina.

30:47.245 --> 30:51.950
Even if Steve wants Teck,
he may not get Teck

30:51.950 --> 30:53.418
if we can rally the votes.

30:53.418 --> 30:54.953
I'm loyal to the end.

30:54.953 --> 30:57.322
So my vote is
gonna be for Casey.

30:57.322 --> 31:00.358
Teck is my guy, so my vote
is gonna be for Tyler.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.393
I hope that nobody
takes this personally.

31:02.393 --> 31:05.330
My vote is going to be
for Casey and Teck.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.932
Sorry about that, man.

31:07.932 --> 31:10.635
I'm sorry, Teck,
I'm gonna have to put you in.

31:10.635 --> 31:12.904
Tina, I'm sorry,
I have to put you in.

31:12.904 --> 31:15.940
- My vote is for you, Tina.
- Oh, shit.

31:15.940 --> 31:18.543
Casey sort of gave up
on the challenge.

31:18.543 --> 31:22.180
So it's remarkable to see
where the votes are going.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.215

at this game.

for the girls is Tina.

31:27.619 --> 31:31.189

Okay, um--

31:43.968 --> 31:46.170

For the men, it's Teck.

32:09.494 --> 32:12.263

Yep, there it is.

hello and goodbye.
Hello, nice meeting you.

I got my bell rung

my time to redeem myself

to the sudden realization

that I did not like

what I was made of
in this elimination.
