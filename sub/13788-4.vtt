10:23.754 --> 10:25.656
HUMANITY HAS FACED
MANY TROUBLES...

10:25.656 --> 10:27.658
ACCOMPLISHED
REMARKABLE FEATS...

10:27.658 --> 10:31.101
AND AMASSED A HUGE LIBRARY
OF STOCK FOOTAGE...

10:31.101 --> 10:34.104
BUT NOTHING IN ALL
OF HUMAN HISTORY

10:34.104 --> 10:36.336
HAS PREPARED IT FOR THIS...

10:36.336 --> 10:38.669
( laughs ) AH...

10:38.669 --> 10:41.341
OH, HELLO, WORLD.
I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.343
I'M STAN. ( clicks tongue )

10:43.343 --> 10:45.415
OH, YEAH!

10:45.415 --> 10:49.079
STAN, WHAT DID YOU DO?
WHAT IF THAT VIDEO GETS OUT?

10:49.079 --> 10:51.982
YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE A RECORDING
LIKE THAT LYING AROUND.

10:51.982 --> 10:53.984
I DIDN'T JUST
LEAVE IT LYING AROUND.

10:53.984 --> 10:57.327
I LEFT IT IN THE CAMERA
IN THE FAMILY ROOM
ON THE TRIPOD.

10:57.327 --> 10:58.729
OH, BOY.

11:01.031 --> 11:03.734
OH, GOOD, IT'S STILL HERE.

11:03.734 --> 11:06.797
WE HAVE TO DELETE
THE MEMORY CARD
BEFORE MOM AND DAD FIND IT.

11:06.797 --> 11:11.802
GOOD IDEA. YOU DON'T WANT
MOM AND DAD TO FIND OUT
WHAT YOU DID.

11:11.802 --> 11:15.105
OKAY! GREAT WORK, EVERYONE!

11:15.105 --> 11:17.447
IF THIS HAD BEEN A REAL COVER UP
AND NOT A DRILL,

11:17.447 --> 11:20.781
WE WOULD'VE BEEN CAUGHT, SO
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SHAVE ABOUT
TEN SECONDS OFF OUR TIME.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.453
BUT THANK YOU, DAD,
FOR HELPING OUT.

11:23.453 --> 11:25.786
HEY, DAD, EVERYONE!
LET'S GIVE HIM A HAND!

11:25.786 --> 11:27.818
GIVE IT UP FOR DAD!
ALL RIGHT!

11:27.818 --> 11:29.960
WHAT DID YOU DO?

11:29.960 --> 11:31.421
WHAT COULD WE HAVE DONE?

11:31.421 --> 11:34.995
WHEN HAVE WE EVER DONE
ANYTHING BAD WITH THE CAMERA?

11:34.995 --> 11:38.729
MILK CARTON.
KITCHEN TABLE. GLUE.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.887
( laughs )

11:58.448 --> 12:01.051
LISTEN, YOUR MOM
IS OUT APPLYING FOR A JOB.

12:01.051 --> 12:03.754
SHE--
DON'T ASK.

12:03.754 --> 12:04.795
AND I'VE GOT A PATIENT WAITING.

12:04.795 --> 12:06.026
WHEN MOM GETS BACK,

12:06.026 --> 12:08.228
WE ARE GONNA FIND OUT
EXACTLY WHAT IS ON THIS TAPE

12:08.228 --> 12:09.930
AND EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.804
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
HE SAID "TAPE."

12:13.804 --> 12:17.437
WHAT IS THIS, 2005?

12:17.437 --> 12:20.871
STAN'S SECRET IS IN JEOPARDY
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING ABOUT?

12:20.871 --> 12:22.212
THANK YOU, AVERY.

12:22.212 --> 12:23.513
BUT "TAPE"?

12:23.513 --> 12:27.377
WHERE DOES HE GET
HIS NEWS FROM? A NEWSPAPER?

12:27.377 --> 12:29.279
( laughs )

12:29.279 --> 12:30.781
I KNOW, RIGHT?

12:32.823 --> 12:35.786
Stan: ( laughs )
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.793
SO, ELLEN. HAVE A SEAT.

12:43.894 --> 12:47.497
OH, WISH I HAD MY STOOL SAMPLE.

12:49.269 --> 12:53.273
SO, I SEE YOUR LAST JOB
WAS AT TOWER RECORDS,

12:53.273 --> 12:56.346
AND THEN THERE SEEMS TO BE
A BIT OF A GAP HERE.

12:56.346 --> 12:59.509
WELL, I WAS ROOM PARENT
FOR THREE YEARS RUNNING

12:59.509 --> 13:03.914
AND TEAM SNACK MOM
UNTIL THE FERMENTING INCIDENT.

13:03.914 --> 13:06.256
BUT I THINK THIS JOB
WILL BE A GREAT FIT,

13:06.256 --> 13:10.060
BECAUSE I REALLY LOVE
ANIMAL... PUNS.

13:10.060 --> 13:14.364
SO IT WOULD BE PURR-FECT FUR ME
TO WORK HERE WITH EWE.

13:14.364 --> 13:16.796
OOH, THAT'S A DOUBLE!

13:16.796 --> 13:21.932
ACTUALLY,
I WAS SPELLING "YOU" E-W-E:
THE FEMALE SHEEP. TRIPLE!

13:21.932 --> 13:23.573
YOU'RE HIRED, KID!

13:23.573 --> 13:24.574
( laughs )

13:24.574 --> 13:25.936
Both: GOAT JOKE!

13:25.936 --> 13:27.277
( both laugh )

13:27.277 --> 13:29.079
IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE,
YOU CAN START RIGHT NOW.

13:29.079 --> 13:31.441
YOU'VE HAD YOUR SHOTS, RIGHT?
( laughs )

13:31.441 --> 13:35.385
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
A LOT OF THESE ANIMALS
HAVE DISEASES.

13:35.385 --> 13:37.817
THIS WON'T HURT... ME.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.289
( laughs )

13:39.289 --> 13:41.291
THAT'S NOT FUNNY ANYMORE.

13:42.422 --> 13:46.556
HE'S TRYING TO PULL MY NOSE
INTO HIS SHELL!

13:46.556 --> 13:48.558
HE'S NOT EVEN
A SNAPPING TURTLE.

13:48.558 --> 13:51.962
HE MUST REALLY HATE YOU.

13:51.962 --> 13:54.564
THERE'S A FERRET
UP MY PANT LEG!

13:54.564 --> 13:59.309
SHE'S JUST LOOKING
FOR SOMEPLACE WARM
TO HAVE HER BABIES.

13:59.309 --> 14:01.611
I'VE NEVER SEEN
SUCH A LARGE POOL OF SICK.

14:01.611 --> 14:04.945
I'M SORRY, DOCTOR,
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN I GET SCARED.

14:06.476 --> 14:10.320
WELL, THAT'S IT.
MY LETTER OF RESIGNATION.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.982
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY, JERRY.

14:11.982 --> 14:14.624
YOU AND ALL YOUR FILTHY,
TERRIFYING ANIMAL FRIENDS

14:14.624 --> 14:18.428
HAVE DRIVEN ME AWAY FROM MY
CALLING OF WORKING WITH ANIMALS.

14:18.428 --> 14:20.460
HEY, PRETTY LADY.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.862
JUST BROUGHT YOU SOME LUNCH
ON YOUR FIRST DAY OF WORK.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.535
OR AM I TAKING YOU HOME NOW?

14:25.535 --> 14:28.098
I'VE GOT "ITYS"
ALL LOCKED AND LOADED.

14:28.098 --> 14:29.339
JUST HAVE TO HIT SEND.

14:29.339 --> 14:33.403
NO, NOT TAKING ME ANYWHERE,
NOT HITTING SEND.

14:33.403 --> 14:38.078
JUST HANGING HERE WITH
MY NEW BEST FRIEND, JERRY,
AS HE DIGESTS HIS LUNCH.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.650
OH, IS THAT A MOUSE
IN ITS THROAT?

14:40.650 --> 14:42.983
NO, IT'S MY CELL PHONE.

14:42.983 --> 14:46.616
SO ANY TEXTS YOU SEND TO ME
WILL GO TO JERRY.

14:46.616 --> 14:48.618
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HAVING FUN.

14:48.618 --> 14:50.620
I GUESS I WAS WRONG.

14:50.620 --> 14:54.264
YES, YOU WERE. NOW IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME, I HAVE WORK TO DO.

14:54.264 --> 14:57.267
SO THANK YOU FOR THE LUNCH,
BUT WE'RE VERY BUSY TODAY.

14:57.267 --> 14:58.568
OKAY, SEE YOU AT HOME.

14:58.568 --> 15:00.100
OKAY.

15:02.572 --> 15:05.505
WELL, JERRY, IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M STUCK HERE FOR AWHILE.

15:10.580 --> 15:12.112
JERRY?

15:14.284 --> 15:15.615
JERRY?

15:23.493 --> 15:25.695
( cell phone rings )

15:25.695 --> 15:28.128
IS THAT THE PHONE RINGING?

15:28.128 --> 15:32.432
IT'S COMING
FROM INSIDE THE SNAKE!

15:32.432 --> 15:35.635
( laughs )

15:40.070 --> 15:42.072
ALL RIGHT, IF WE WANT
TO PROTECT STAN'S SECRET,

15:42.072 --> 15:46.276
WE HAVE TO GET THAT CAMERA
BACK FROM DAD BEFORE HE SEES
THAT STAN CAN TALK.

15:46.276 --> 15:47.947
I'M SORRY, GUYS, IT'S MY FAULT.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.080
I WANTED SO BAD
TO LEAVE A LEGACY.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.453
IT'S OKAY, STAN.
WE JUST NEED SOME CLEVER IDEAS.
LET'S HEAR THEM.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.086
WE COULD RELEASE A HONEY BADGER
IN HIS OFFICE.

15:56.086 --> 15:57.587
HE'D FORGET ALL ABOUT US.

15:57.587 --> 16:01.131
NOBODY MESSES WITH
A HONEY BADGER.

16:01.131 --> 16:02.692
WHERE WOULD WE GET
A HONEY BADGER?

16:02.692 --> 16:05.335
"BED, BADGER, AND BEYOND."

16:05.335 --> 16:06.496
THAT'S NOT A STORE.

16:06.496 --> 16:09.699
THEN WHO KEEPS SENDING ME
THE 20% OFF COUPONS?

16:09.699 --> 16:12.702
OKAY, ANY OTHER IDEAS?

16:12.702 --> 16:15.205
MAYBE SOMETHING,
I DON'T KNOW, POSSIBLE?

16:15.205 --> 16:17.547
IT'S TOO BAD WE JUST CAN'T WALK
IN THERE AND TAKE THE CAMERA

16:17.547 --> 16:19.979
WHILE DADDY'S
VISITING MOMMY AT HER NEW JOB.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.611
WAIT, DAD'S NOT HERE?

16:21.611 --> 16:25.455
WE COULD JUST WALK IN THERE
AND TAKE THE CAMERA?
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

16:25.455 --> 16:27.287
YOU SAID WE NEEDED
A CLEVER PLAN.

16:27.287 --> 16:30.620
WALKING IN THERE'S NOT CLEVER.
IT'S BARELY A PLAN.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.631
I DIDN'T KNOW GOLDFISH
COULD BITE SOMEONE.

16:41.631 --> 16:43.503
THEY CAN'T.
THEY DON'T HAVE TEETH.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.175
I DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS HAPPENED.

16:45.175 --> 16:46.406
( phone rings )

16:46.406 --> 16:48.238
WELL, THIS HAS BEEN
A CHALLENGING DAY,

16:48.238 --> 16:50.080
BUT I'M SURE
THE WORST IS BEHIND ME.

16:50.080 --> 16:53.243
HOW COULD IT NOT BE?

16:53.243 --> 16:55.215
OH, OUR NEXT CLIENT
IS ON THE WAY IN.

16:55.215 --> 16:58.718
ONE OF OUR CLIENTS FOUND
THIS LOVELY PARROT IN THE PARK.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.751
( squawks ) ELLEN CAN'T COOK!

17:01.751 --> 17:04.224
LUCY.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.526
( squawks ) LUCY.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.298
NOT AGAIN!

17:08.298 --> 17:09.529
( squawks ) AGAIN! AGAIN!

17:09.529 --> 17:12.662
( screams )

17:14.734 --> 17:16.206
ARE YOU OKAY?

17:16.206 --> 17:18.538
NO, I AM NOT OKAY.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.370
WHENEVER IT COMES
TO ME AND ANIMALS,

17:20.370 --> 17:22.172
THINGS JUST GO HORRIBLY WRONG.

17:22.172 --> 17:24.644
LIKE THAT PARROT
WHO'S JUST WAITING UP THERE
FOR ME TO COME OUT

17:24.644 --> 17:26.776
SO SHE CAN GOUGE OUT MY EYES
OR RIP OUT MY THROAT

17:26.776 --> 17:29.119
OR SAY HURTFUL THINGS ABOUT ME!

17:29.119 --> 17:33.683
BUT I CAN'T QUIT
BECAUSE MY HUSBAND
WILL SAY "I TOLD YOU SO."

17:33.683 --> 17:35.655
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO FIRE YOU?

17:35.655 --> 17:38.458
WOULD YOU?
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING!

17:38.458 --> 17:40.160
IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.792
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?
YELL AT A CLIENT?
STEAL SOMETHING?

17:42.792 --> 17:45.335
NO, WHAT YOU HAVE
DONE ALREADY IS JUST FINE.

17:45.335 --> 17:48.498
THIS IS CALLED
"GROSS INCOMPETENCE."

17:48.498 --> 17:51.841
"GROSS INCOMPETENCE"--
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

17:51.841 --> 17:53.643
GROSS INCOMPETENCE.

17:53.643 --> 17:56.576
( squawks and laughs )

17:59.679 --> 18:01.681
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT IT,
NOW LET'S DELETE IT.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.283
ARE YOU KIDDING?

18:03.283 --> 18:05.355
IF WE DELETE IT, DAD'LL SEE
THAT THERE'S NOTHING ON IT

18:05.355 --> 18:06.616
AND FIGURE OUT WE DELETED IT.

18:06.616 --> 18:08.658
WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING.

18:08.658 --> 18:12.662
I GET IT. WE HAVE
TO REPLACE STAN'S RECORDING
WITH ANOTHER RECORDING

18:12.662 --> 18:14.624
THAT WE'D WANT
TO HIDE FROM MOM AND DAD.

18:14.624 --> 18:16.696
HOW ARE YOU
AHEAD OF ME ON THIS?

18:16.696 --> 18:19.529
I DON'T LISTEN IN CLASS
AND I NEVER DO HOMEWORK.

18:19.529 --> 18:21.671
THAT LEAVES MY BRAIN FREE
FOR PLANS, SCHEMES,

18:21.671 --> 18:24.304
AND THINGS SO CRAZY
THEY JUST MIGHT WORK.

18:24.304 --> 18:27.106
OKAY, SO WHAT DO WE RECORD
O REPLACE STAN?

18:27.106 --> 18:30.580
SOMETHING BAD ENOUGH
THAT WHEN THEY SEE IT, THEY SAY,
"WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?"

18:30.580 --> 18:32.582
BUT NOT SO BAD
THAT THEY TRY TO FIX YOU.

18:32.582 --> 18:35.585
THE WORST IS WHEN DAD LETS YOU
KNOW IT'S OKAY TO CRY...

18:35.585 --> 18:37.817
BY CRYING.

18:37.817 --> 18:41.821
NO, THE WORST IS WHEN
DAD SNEAKS INTO MY ROOM
TO ANALYZE MY ART WALL.

18:41.821 --> 18:45.595
SOMETIMES I PAINT
HEADLESS CLOWNS
JUST TO MESS WITH HIM.

18:45.595 --> 18:49.299
THOSE ARE THE NIGHTS
I CAN'T SLEEP IN YOUR ROOM.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.302
CHLOE, WHERE WERE YOU?

18:52.302 --> 18:54.204
GETTING MY SMOOTHIE
FROM THE FRIDGE.

18:54.204 --> 18:57.707
I FIGURED TWO PEOPLE
AND A TALKING DOG COULD PICK UP
A CAMERA IN AN EMPTY ROOM.

18:57.707 --> 19:00.310
DID YOU NEED A LITTLE GIRL?

19:03.913 --> 19:06.616
AH. I'M HOME.

19:06.616 --> 19:08.748
OH, YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.581
AND SEND.

19:11.581 --> 19:15.385
THE JOKE'S ON YOU. I TOLD YOU
I DON'T HAVE MY PHONE.

19:15.385 --> 19:17.387
( quacking )

19:17.387 --> 19:21.831
JERRY?! DID YOU EAT A DUCK?!

19:21.831 --> 19:25.535
AND YOU DON'T GET
TO SAY "I TOLD YOU SO"
BECAUSE I DIDN'T QUIT.

19:25.535 --> 19:29.369
I WAS FIRED. GROSS INCOMPETENCE.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.601
HA! WHO FEELS STUPID NOW?

19:35.245 --> 19:38.508
ALL RIGHT, LET'S FIND OUT
WHAT YOU KIDS HAVE BEEN HIDING.

19:40.710 --> 19:46.786
AVERY, I KNOW THAT MOM AND DAD
WOULD NOT APPROVE OF US
PLAYING KITCHEN TENNIS.

19:46.786 --> 19:53.323
WHOA! WHAT?! CHLOE, WHY ARE YOU
RECORDING US DOING THAT WHICH
WE ARE FORBIDDEN TO DO?

19:53.323 --> 19:56.666
NOTICE THAT SHE SAID
"RECORDING," NOT "TAPING."

19:56.666 --> 19:59.669
YOU SEE, TAPING IS SOMETHING
PEOPLE USED TO DO BEFORE 2005

19:59.669 --> 20:01.671
WHEN THERE WAS
ACTUALLY TAPE IN THE CAMERAS.

20:02.972 --> 20:06.676
HEY, TYLER, WATCH OUT FOR THAT
VASE OF FLOWERS OVER THERE!

20:06.676 --> 20:09.809
WE'D GET IN A LOT OF TROUBLE
IF WE HIT THAT WITH THE BALL!

20:09.809 --> 20:10.880
WHOOPS!

20:12.211 --> 20:13.513
OH, MAN, I MISSED!

20:13.513 --> 20:14.784
Avery: STAN!

20:14.784 --> 20:16.646
HEY, I KNOW THAT
WASN'T PART OF THE PLAN,

20:16.646 --> 20:18.548
BUT I SEE A BALL,
I'M GOING FOR IT.

20:18.548 --> 20:22.692
OH, MY GOSH, IS THAT HOW I RUN?

20:23.923 --> 20:24.924
Tyler: STAN!

20:24.924 --> 20:27.697
Avery: OH, NO! NOT THE TABLE!

20:27.697 --> 20:29.629
( clattering )

20:29.629 --> 20:30.860
Avery: OH!

20:30.860 --> 20:32.762
Tyler: OH, WATCH OUT!

20:36.606 --> 20:39.269
HUH. THAT'LL WORK,
TOO, I GUESS.

20:43.273 --> 20:47.747
( slurping )

20:47.747 --> 20:50.550
THAT'S IT.
NO TV FOR A WEEK.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.821
WHAT?!
NO!

20:51.821 --> 20:54.584
IS IT BECAUSE OF
MY POOR CAMERA WORK?

20:54.584 --> 20:56.656
AVERY, I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU,

20:56.656 --> 21:00.730
BUT I' AM GOING
TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY
AT YOUR ART WALL TONIGHT.

21:03.733 --> 21:06.596
SO, WHAT DO YOU
THINK THE KIDS REALLY DID

21:06.596 --> 21:08.838
THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO COVER UP
WITH THAT RIDICULOUS VIDEO?

21:08.838 --> 21:10.370
PROBABLY SOMETHING
A WHOLE LOT WORSE,

21:10.370 --> 21:11.701
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

21:11.701 --> 21:12.842
I'VE HAD THE WORST DAY.

21:12.842 --> 21:16.005
I HAVE BEEN BITTEN, SCRATCHED,
MAULED, AND PUKED ON,

21:16.005 --> 21:18.948
AND ONLY ONE OF THOSE
WAS SELF-INFLICTED.

21:22.512 --> 21:23.813
I'M REALLY SORRY, GUYS.

21:23.813 --> 21:25.315
IF I HADN'T MADE THAT VIDEO,

21:25.315 --> 21:26.786
NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY

21:26.786 --> 21:28.558
AND YOU WOULDN'T BE
PAYING FOR IT.

21:28.558 --> 21:32.422
IT'S OKAY, STAN.
ANYTHING IS WORTH
KEEPING YOUR SECRET SAFE.

21:32.422 --> 21:35.064
YEAH, YOU BEING HERE
MAKES UP FOR ANY PUNISHMENT.

21:35.064 --> 21:38.067
BEING WITH YOU GUYS
IS ALL THAT MATTERS TO ME, TOO.

21:38.067 --> 21:41.431
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S MY LEGACY.

21:41.431 --> 21:45.635
YOU LIVE ON IN THE HEARTS
OF THOSE WHOSE LIVES YOU TOUCH,
DON'T YOU?

21:45.635 --> 21:46.976
WELL, UNTIL THEY DIE.

21:46.976 --> 21:50.510
TYLER, YOU'RE NOT HELPING.

21:50.510 --> 21:54.714
BESIDES, STAN, NO ONE KNOWS
HOW LONG TALKING DOGS LIVE.

21:54.714 --> 21:57.046
MAYBE YOU'LL LIVE WAY LONGER
THAN REGULAR DOGS.

21:57.046 --> 21:58.548
OR MAYBE WAY SHORTER.

21:58.548 --> 21:59.989
TYLER!

21:59.989 --> 22:02.822
IT'S TRUE I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG I HAVE,

22:02.822 --> 22:08.027
BUT HOWEVER LONG IT IS,
MY LEGACY IS THE PEOPLE I LOVE.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.760
NOW I'M GONNA GO ONTO THE BED,
BADGERS, AND BEYOND SITE

22:10.760 --> 22:12.432
AND PRINT A RETURN LABEL.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.734
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH THESE DISCOUNT COUPONS.

22:14.734 --> 22:17.867
YOU END UP BUYING BADGERS
YOU DON'T REALLY NEED.

22:17.867 --> 22:20.410
WHERE'D THEY GO?

22:20.410 --> 22:21.571
( Ellen screams )

22:21.571 --> 22:22.872
OH, BOY.

22:22.872 --> 22:27.917
( screams )
THERE'S BADGERS IN MY ROBE!

22:30.580 --> 22:32.722
WHOA! COOL!

22:32.722 --> 22:35.725
I DID LIVE WAY LONGER
THAN REGULAR DOGS!

22:35.725 --> 22:38.087
I EVEN OUTLIVED PLANET EARTH!

22:38.087 --> 22:39.589
( slurping )
OH, NO!

22:39.589 --> 22:42.562
I'M BEING SUCKED
INTO A BLACK HOLE!

22:42.562 --> 22:44.434
( slurping )

22:44.434 --> 22:46.636
OKAY, THAT MAKES
A LOT MORE SENSE.
