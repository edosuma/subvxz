WEBVTT

01:38.099 --> 01:40.602
I have a ship waiting
to take your son, Ivar,

01:40.685 --> 01:42.479
back to your kingdom.

01:44.814 --> 01:47.233
The captain wishes
to leave today.

01:49.194 --> 01:51.404
I need to say
goodbye to him.

01:56.076 --> 01:58.286
I'll have him
brought to you.

02:00.371 --> 02:02.499
I want to talk
to him alone.

03:13.611 --> 03:16.114
We have orders
to take the cripple.

03:19.117 --> 03:21.202
I have
some good news.

03:21.286 --> 03:25.081
King Ecbert has
arranged for a boat.
You are going home.

03:27.041 --> 03:29.085
I'm not going without you.

03:34.507 --> 03:36.885
They aren't going
to release me.

03:39.053 --> 03:40.555
I have to die.

03:44.642 --> 03:46.936
Then I'll die, too.
I'm thinking of
being burned alive.

03:47.020 --> 03:48.855
Don't be stupid.

03:50.982 --> 03:52.942
I don't want
you to die.

03:56.279 --> 03:59.282
It is far more important
that you stay alive.

04:07.999 --> 04:10.668
People think that
you are not a threat.

04:11.878 --> 04:13.838
But I know differently.

04:15.298 --> 04:20.178
Out of all of my sons,
it was you I wanted
to bring here,

04:20.261 --> 04:23.598
and it is you
that I believe

04:23.681 --> 04:26.893
is the most important
to the future of our people.

04:30.855 --> 04:33.483
I'm just about prepared
to believe you.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.027
Shut up and listen, idiot.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.988
You have many gifts,
and anger is a gift.

04:39.072 --> 04:41.366
What is in here
is a gift.

04:43.117 --> 04:46.621
You do not think
like other men.
You are unpredictable.

04:47.664 --> 04:49.874
And that will
serve you well.

04:51.292 --> 04:54.128
Use your
anger intelligently,

04:54.212 --> 04:55.880
and I promise you,
my son,

04:55.964 --> 05:02.845
that one day
the whole world will know
and fear Ivar, the Boneless.

05:11.062 --> 05:12.355
I wish...

05:13.314 --> 05:15.942
I wish I wasn't
so angry all the time.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.366
Then you would be nothing.

05:26.536 --> 05:28.454
I might have been happy.

05:28.538 --> 05:30.540
Happiness is nothing.

05:33.626 --> 05:36.546
I was only joking. Idiot!

05:53.855 --> 05:59.277
Ecbert is handing me
over to King Aelle,
who will kill me.

06:00.653 --> 06:02.697
If this Aelle is
going to kill you,

06:02.780 --> 06:06.284
then me and all my
brothers will seek him
for revenge and you know that.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.702
Yes.

06:08.494 --> 06:10.788
Oh, you must seek revenge,

06:12.582 --> 06:14.208
but not on Aelle.

06:18.212 --> 06:19.547
On Ecbert.

06:32.185 --> 06:34.979
Everyone will
always underestimate you.

06:37.106 --> 06:39.317
You must make them
pay for it.

06:58.544 --> 07:00.254
I will, Father.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.011
Be ruthless.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.075
Move!

07:41.712 --> 07:42.880
Move out!

08:22.837 --> 08:25.923
<i>I have always
known you as an eloquent man.</i>

08:26.507 --> 08:28.551
Why don't you
speak to me?

08:32.889 --> 08:34.807
Words lead to actions.

08:38.352 --> 08:42.190
In this case,
I would wish
things were otherwise,

08:42.273 --> 08:45.026
but I have no power
to change them.

08:45.109 --> 08:49.780
So, words don't help.

08:59.499 --> 09:03.836
You have been astonishing.

09:04.921 --> 09:08.591
You have given me freedoms,
extraordinary freedoms,

09:08.674 --> 09:10.593
and yet you have not
claimed me as your property,

09:10.676 --> 09:14.138
so I'm still
married to my husband
in a proper Christian way.

09:16.474 --> 09:18.851
I would have
been torn to pieces.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.566
I love you.

09:26.484 --> 09:28.194
I cannot help that.

09:29.487 --> 09:33.824
Without knowing it,
you have helped me

09:33.908 --> 09:37.119
through the most
difficult years of my life.

09:39.372 --> 09:42.083
And yet,
you thrive on adversity,

09:42.166 --> 09:45.670
and you know
there is no difficulty
that cannot be met.

09:55.346 --> 09:56.847
But now...

09:58.349 --> 10:03.145
I must do
something that I would
not wish on anyone.

10:05.523 --> 10:07.650
I have to destroy something,

10:08.401 --> 10:12.196
someone truly great.

10:15.366 --> 10:18.536
And I have to
commit a friend to death.

10:28.588 --> 10:30.214
You have no choice.

10:30.298 --> 10:32.842
Oh, is that true?

10:34.927 --> 10:37.054
Is that really true?

10:37.680 --> 10:41.017
So, do I just
wash my hands of him?

10:41.892 --> 10:44.103
Like Pontius Pilate?

10:53.237 --> 10:56.032
Well, I have no doubt
Aelle will enjoy
the sight of your death.

10:56.115 --> 10:57.116
Mmm.

10:58.242 --> 11:00.745
I'm sure he'll make it
a big spectacle.

11:05.124 --> 11:07.710
So I will have
the chance to speak.

11:09.754 --> 11:11.881
I will talk about the gods,

11:13.758 --> 11:17.428
about my joy
of entering Valhalla.

11:20.890 --> 11:23.267
Even though
you don't believe it.

11:27.021 --> 11:28.272
I don't.

11:31.192 --> 11:32.735
But my sons do.

11:34.236 --> 11:35.696
My people do.

11:37.239 --> 11:42.495
Faith is as important
to them as it is to you,
King Ecbert.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.863
Let's not
keep them waiting.

14:16.315 --> 14:18.192
This was your father's.

14:22.196 --> 14:27.201
May it comfort you
as it has comforted me.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.336
Thank you.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.381
I will never forget you.

14:47.221 --> 14:50.641
I think it will
console you to know,
in the end,

14:51.517 --> 14:53.519
Athelstan chose your God.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.993
Soldiers, turn!

15:11.579 --> 15:14.206
Prisoner escort, advance!

15:57.207 --> 15:59.335
I've heard
a lot about you.

16:00.377 --> 16:02.129
Eight foot tall,

16:03.631 --> 16:06.050
killed thousands
of my countrymen,

16:07.635 --> 16:09.053
eats children.

16:11.764 --> 16:13.766
The last one is not true.

16:16.185 --> 16:18.145
Maybe none of it's true.

16:19.688 --> 16:24.485
Still, I could smell
the fear of everyone around.

16:25.027 --> 16:28.656
They're terrified
you are going to kill 'em.

16:30.908 --> 16:32.159
Tell me,

16:33.827 --> 16:36.080
how are you
going to escape?

16:37.081 --> 16:39.500
I have no intentions
of escaping.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.270
Ecbert?

19:10.275 --> 19:11.318
Hmm.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.271
Where are we?

19:47.437 --> 19:50.274
I don't know.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.777
You'd do better
to ask the horses.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.114
They know.

19:59.491 --> 20:00.951
You're blind.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.286
Sure am.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.455
But the horses
know the way.

20:06.123 --> 20:07.749
But don't worry,

20:08.417 --> 20:11.712
I can see you,
Ragnar Lothbrok.

20:12.963 --> 20:14.548
I can see you.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.435
When will we
reach King Aelle's?

20:26.518 --> 20:28.270
Not until tomorrow.

20:39.489 --> 20:42.993
It will be at
least another day
before I am put to death.

20:44.161 --> 20:46.079
You and your gods
are wrong.

20:46.163 --> 20:48.206
You see, I guided my fate.

20:49.416 --> 20:53.754
I fashioned
the course of my life
and my death. Me.

20:53.837 --> 20:56.006
Not you. Not the gods. Me.

20:56.840 --> 21:00.218
This was my idea,
to come here to die.

21:01.261 --> 21:05.515
You believe that,
so it is true, to you.

21:06.516 --> 21:09.269
Ah, the riddles
you speak.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.980
They have no real meaning.

21:12.064 --> 21:14.566
Your words can be interpreted
in so many ways

21:14.650 --> 21:18.487
that they cease
to cause comfort or knowledge,

21:18.570 --> 21:20.364
but rather confusion.

21:21.490 --> 21:24.910
Your so-called prophecies
are dangerous.

21:25.786 --> 21:26.995
How so?

21:29.581 --> 21:33.418
By telling Lagertha
that she would never
have another child.

21:33.877 --> 21:37.714
Yet she got pregnant.
But then,
because of your words,

21:39.883 --> 21:42.344
she put her
unborn baby in danger.

21:43.595 --> 21:46.306
So, what if she
didn't hear your words?

21:46.556 --> 21:49.685
What if she thought
her baby would survive?

21:49.768 --> 21:52.521
She would have rested
and protected it.

21:52.604 --> 21:56.525
And now maybe she would
be the proud mother
of a healthy child.

21:57.734 --> 22:00.862
Something she always wanted,
more than anything.

22:03.740 --> 22:08.787
So, you presented
her a destiny
and she manifested it.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.875
Perhaps it was
her fate to have

22:13.959 --> 22:17.337
the child perish
in exactly the way it did.

22:17.754 --> 22:19.006
But what if it wasn't?

22:19.089 --> 22:20.590
What if it was?

22:22.592 --> 22:25.345
I don't believe
in the gods' existence.

22:26.263 --> 22:29.141
Man is the master
of his own fate,
not the gods.

22:29.307 --> 22:31.018
The gods are man's creation
to give answers

22:31.101 --> 22:34.146
that they are too afraid
to give themselves.

22:35.272 --> 22:37.941
You may be right,
Ragnar Lothbrok.

22:38.817 --> 22:43.739
I am only the Seer.
I have walked among
the lowest of the dead.

22:44.823 --> 22:47.075
And I have groped
for meaning.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.245
And I may have been wrong.

22:53.123 --> 22:54.791
What did you say?

22:56.543 --> 22:58.420
I didn't say anything.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.331
Brother.

24:15.956 --> 24:17.374
Don't kill me.

24:21.962 --> 24:23.213
<i>Without the word of God,</i>

24:25.173 --> 24:27.050
<i>there is only darkness.</i>

26:11.404 --> 26:14.908
It's taken you
a long time to return,
Ragnar Lothbrok,

26:16.159 --> 26:18.536
but at last you are here.

26:19.329 --> 26:23.833
And I thank God
and all his angels that
I have kept my promise,

26:24.793 --> 26:27.504
and I'm still alive
to witness this day.

26:30.840 --> 26:34.344
And I swear,
before you die,

26:35.011 --> 26:39.599
you will atone
for your sins
against my countrymen.

27:34.779 --> 27:36.406
Burn the dog!

28:24.788 --> 28:28.124
This is a good day,
Ragnar Lothbrok.

28:28.208 --> 28:31.252
For this is the day
that the souls

28:31.336 --> 28:34.964
of every innocent
Christian man, woman,
and child

28:35.048 --> 28:37.300
that you and your
pagans slaughtered

28:38.968 --> 28:42.806
shall escape
from their purgatory
and sing hallelujah.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.184
For I am about
the Lord's work.

28:47.018 --> 28:49.646
God has chosen me,
without doubt,

28:50.271 --> 28:52.941
as the instrument
of his judgment.

29:22.762 --> 29:26.850
Get him! Kick him! Get up!

29:27.934 --> 29:29.352
Leave him!

29:31.688 --> 29:33.356
- Get him up!
- Bring him!

29:44.576 --> 29:46.327
Ask for absolution.

30:05.263 --> 30:08.558
<i>That's why
we should sail west.</i>

30:08.641 --> 30:10.977
<i>I've heard
such tales, Rollo.</i>

30:11.060 --> 30:13.021
<i>Great towns and cities.</i>

30:13.104 --> 30:17.650
<i>Treasures and hordes
of gold and silver,
and a new God.</i>

30:28.077 --> 30:30.371
Ask for absolution.

31:03.321 --> 31:05.240
Ask for absolution.

31:59.669 --> 32:02.505
How the little piggies
will grunt

32:03.589 --> 32:07.468
when they hear
how the old boar suffered.

34:14.595 --> 34:15.805
My brother.

34:32.905 --> 34:35.700
Our Father,
who art in Heaven...

34:36.993 --> 34:38.578
<i>Our Father,</i>

34:38.870 --> 34:40.455
who art in Heaven...

34:40.538 --> 34:43.708
Hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come,

34:43.791 --> 34:47.003
Thy will be done on Earth
as it is in Heaven.

34:47.378 --> 34:49.839
Give us this day
our daily bread

34:49.922 --> 34:51.924
and forgive us
our trespasses,

34:52.008 --> 34:55.261
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

34:55.344 --> 34:57.597
And lead us not
into temptation

34:57.680 --> 35:01.017
but deliver us
from evil. Amen.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.649
To your ropes.

35:16.616 --> 35:17.700
Pull!

35:35.384 --> 35:37.094
<i>Not unto us,
oh Lord,</i>

35:37.553 --> 35:42.391
not unto us,
but unto Thy name
give glory.

35:42.642 --> 35:48.022
Their idols are
silver and gold,
the work of men's hands.

35:48.773 --> 35:52.235
They have mouths,
but they speak not.

35:53.277 --> 35:57.031
Eyes have they,
but they see not.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.143
Kill him!

36:53.546 --> 36:56.465
<i>Deliver me, Lord,
from the evil man.</i>

36:58.301 --> 37:02.471
Preserveth me
from the violent man.

37:04.307 --> 37:09.770
Surely, the righteous
shall give thanks
unto Thy name.

37:11.147 --> 37:15.318
The upright shall
dwell in Thy presence.

37:27.330 --> 37:30.583
Oh Lord, hear my prayer.

38:04.742 --> 38:09.622
It gladdens me
to know that Odin
prepares for a feast.

38:10.039 --> 38:14.251
Soon, I shall be
drinking ale from
curved horns!

38:19.173 --> 38:23.386
This hero that
comes into Valhalla
does not lament his death!

38:25.554 --> 38:29.058
I shall not enter
Odin's hall with fear.

38:37.149 --> 38:40.903
There, I shall wait
for my sons to join me.

38:42.071 --> 38:44.407
And, when they do,

38:44.490 --> 38:48.077
I will bask
in their tales of triumph.

38:56.794 --> 38:59.296
The Aesir will welcome me!

39:01.799 --> 39:04.927
My death comes
without apology!

39:07.221 --> 39:12.393
And I welcome the valkyries
to summon me home!

39:16.147 --> 39:21.277
Deliver me, oh Lord,
from mine enemies!

43:15.969 --> 43:17.721
Where is
our father?

43:22.393 --> 43:24.019
Where is Ragnar?

43:28.816 --> 43:32.152
King Ecbert handed him
over to King Aelle,

43:32.236 --> 43:34.363
knowing that
Aelle would kill him.

43:40.828 --> 43:42.663
Why would he
give him to Aelle?

43:42.746 --> 43:46.709
That doesn't matter.
Our father is
probably dead by now.

43:49.128 --> 43:51.422
And we will
have to avenge him.

43:55.050 --> 43:56.885
That is what matters.

44:15.404 --> 44:17.614
We have something
to tell you.

44:21.910 --> 44:23.036
Ubbe?

44:32.921 --> 44:34.465
Mother is dead.
