(calm music playing)

00:45.567 --> 00:49.600
(birds chirping)

01:05.367 --> 01:09.200
Blanche, would you mind coming over
and actually doing something?

01:09.266 --> 01:12.300
Are you implying
I'm not pulling my weight?

01:12.367 --> 01:14.767
That's between you
and the laws of physics.

01:17.900 --> 01:20.900
These are your father's things.
You should be helping.

01:20.967 --> 01:23.834
The auction's only days away.
There's lots to do.

01:23.900 --> 01:26.100
It's just so hard for me.

01:26.166 --> 01:30.000
Big Daddy's been gone a year,
and I'm selling off his things.

01:30.066 --> 01:33.100
-Oh, it has to be done.
-I know it.

01:33.166 --> 01:37.200
I didn't realize seeing these things
would bring back so many memories.

01:37.266 --> 01:42.433
Like Big Daddy's Bible.
Never went anywhere without this.

01:47.867 --> 01:49.700
Whiskey! (inhales)

01:49.767 --> 01:53.000
That explains why every Sunday
after services he'd stand up and yell,

01:53.066 --> 01:55.166
"I can lick any man in this church!"

01:56.800 --> 02:01.834
Ah. Oh, pussycat.
Just the person I was looking for.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.533
I have a question.
Strictly hypothetical.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.900
Let's say a man wants
to take you out.

02:06.967 --> 02:08.700
Why is that hypothetical?
(laughs)

02:08.767 --> 02:10.433
Check your calendar, pussycat.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.900
Um, now, would you rather
this man had looks,

02:15.967 --> 02:17.333
personality, or money?

02:17.800 --> 02:19.233
Personality.

02:20.367 --> 02:22.166
Looks?

02:22.233 --> 02:23.967
Money?

02:24.834 --> 02:26.834
Why did you ask me that?

02:26.900 --> 02:30.133
No reason. Just wanted to get
your honest opinion. phew.

02:32.633 --> 02:34.533
Here are the answers
to that questionnaire.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.467
Uh-huh.

02:35.533 --> 02:38.467
If Dorothy finds out I hired her
a matchmaker, she'll kill me.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.100
Oh, I understand.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.667
I'd like to change
the answer on number 10.

02:43.734 --> 02:46.333
I think a prison record does matter.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.867
Ok, but you just
cut her chances in half.

02:52.467 --> 02:54.266
Never mind. Whatever you got.

02:55.266 --> 02:58.467
-Sofia, you know what you're doing?
-Of course.

02:58.533 --> 03:03.533
What do you think of a woman who cries
because she's bored and lonely?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.934
-Your daughter does that?
-I do that.

03:07.633 --> 03:11.800
If you fix Dorothy with somebody
maybe I can get out of the house

03:11.867 --> 03:14.400
or at least stay in
and walk around naked.

03:15.433 --> 03:18.600
-Look, you better be going.
-Ok, I'll call you tomorrow.

03:18.667 --> 03:22.400
Wait a minute. You forgot
the questions on the back,

03:22.467 --> 03:24.233
and I need a picture.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.700
-How about a thousand words?
-No.

03:26.767 --> 03:29.567
I'll get a picture.
Now, move, move!

03:29.633 --> 03:31.633
(indistinct chatter)

03:31.700 --> 03:34.266
Hey! That sign says,
"No soliciting."

03:34.333 --> 03:36.800
Come back here
and I'll blow your head off!

03:41.000 --> 03:43.200
-(telephone rings)
-I'll get it.

03:43.266 --> 03:45.967
Pussycat, I have another
hypothetical question.

03:46.033 --> 03:48.333
Let's say a man is interested in you.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.266
This won't stop until one of us dies.

03:51.333 --> 03:52.266
No.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.700
Which of the following characteristics
could you live with?

03:56.767 --> 04:00.266
Body odor, schizophrenia...

04:01.033 --> 04:02.367
...extra toes.

04:04.633 --> 04:06.767
Ma, I couldn't live with any of those.

04:06.834 --> 04:12.066
I'm perfectly capable of attracting a man
who is charming, good-looking,

04:12.133 --> 04:14.767
and interested
in personal hygiene.

04:15.567 --> 04:18.166
Are you going to take this
seriously or not?

04:18.567 --> 04:20.166
(Blanche sobs)

04:20.233 --> 04:23.967
-Blanche, are you all right?
-I'm stunned. I'm just stunned.

04:24.033 --> 04:26.133
-Honey, what's wrong?
-That call--

04:26.200 --> 04:30.834
It was Viola Watkins.
She used to be my mammy.

04:30.900 --> 04:33.033
-You're what?
-My mammy.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.367
She took care of me when I was little.

04:35.433 --> 04:40.633
I'm sorry. I've never heard anyone
called mammy before. (chuckles)

04:41.633 --> 04:43.567
What about Mrs. Eisenhower?

04:51.467 --> 04:53.467
Mammy Eisenhower.

04:53.533 --> 04:56.633
I think only the Nixon kids
got to call her that.

05:00.533 --> 05:04.133
Mammy said she'll be in town.
She wants to see me.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.734
You don't sound happy.
Didn't you like her?

05:06.800 --> 05:09.934
Oh, I adored her.
She was like another mother.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.767
She was the only friend I had.
I was a lonely child.

05:14.834 --> 05:18.667
My sisters refused to play with me
because I was so beautiful.

05:21.734 --> 05:25.367
Do you know what that's like?
No, of course you don't.

05:29.967 --> 05:33.233
I loved her.
I thought she loved me.

05:33.300 --> 05:36.567
Then one day, when I was 10,
she left.

05:36.633 --> 05:40.600
No goodbyes, no explanation,
just disappeared.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.700
I was devastated.

05:42.767 --> 05:45.166
We southerners
don't forget things like that.

05:45.233 --> 05:48.734
It's true.
Possum is brain food.

05:51.700 --> 05:55.767
I had a nanny when I was a child.
She was my best friend.

05:55.834 --> 05:59.633
I could tell her anything,
and she'd keep it a secret. (chuckles)

05:59.700 --> 06:03.767
Oh, we'd spend the days running
and playing in the meadow,

06:03.834 --> 06:06.066
or playing hide and seek in the barn.

06:06.133 --> 06:10.000
My nanny treated me just like
I was her own kid.

06:10.066 --> 06:11.467
Excuse me.
(crying)

06:14.000 --> 06:17.734
Is there anyone here who doesn't think
she was talking about a goat?

06:22.967 --> 06:25.333
(slow music playing)

06:27.166 --> 06:30.200
Hi, pussycat.
Gee, you look nice tonight.

06:30.266 --> 06:31.300
Thank you.
(laughs)

06:31.367 --> 06:34.166
But lean over and smile.
There's something on your teeth.

06:34.233 --> 06:35.500
Oh, really?

06:35.567 --> 06:37.033
(camera shutter clicks)

06:45.266 --> 06:47.033
Ma, why did you do that?

06:47.100 --> 06:50.700
Playboy's running a spread
on the substitute teachers of Miami.

06:52.567 --> 06:54.400
(doorbell rings)

06:54.467 --> 06:56.200
Oh, I'll get it.

07:00.700 --> 07:04.734
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Blanche Devereaux.

07:04.800 --> 07:08.300
-Mammy? Mammy Watkins?
-Blanche?

07:08.367 --> 07:11.000
I sure could use a hug.

07:12.667 --> 07:14.467
Okey-dokey.

07:19.233 --> 07:22.734
-I was speaking to Blanche.
-Oh.

07:23.934 --> 07:26.767
-Dumpling!
-Oh!

07:26.834 --> 07:30.467
Mammy, I want you to meet my friends.
This is Dorothy Zbornak.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.600
-Nice to meet you.
-And this is Rose Nylund.

07:33.667 --> 07:35.700
Oh, we've met.
(laughs)

07:35.767 --> 07:37.400
Won't you sit down?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.633
Blanche, I wanted to tell you

07:40.700 --> 07:43.467
how sorry I was to hear
of your father's passing.

07:43.533 --> 07:45.967
He was a wonderful,
wonderful man.

07:46.033 --> 07:46.900
Thank you.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.066
As a matter of fact,
that's the reason I'm here.

07:50.133 --> 07:50.934
Oh?

07:51.033 --> 07:55.767
My friends read you'd be selling off
his things here in Miami.

07:55.834 --> 07:59.166
Before you did,
there's something I'd like to ask for.

07:59.233 --> 08:01.834
-The Bible?
-No, thanks, I don't drink.

08:05.834 --> 08:09.400
It's a music box.
I gave it to your family.

08:09.467 --> 08:12.033
I can't bear the thought
of a stranger buying it.

08:12.100 --> 08:15.500
(laughs)
I'm afraid I can't bid for it myself.

08:15.567 --> 08:20.767
-I was hoping you could give it to me.
-Let me get this right...

08:20.834 --> 08:23.734
I don't hear from you
for years and years.

08:23.800 --> 08:28.533
Then you come waltzing in,
telling me you want a music box?

08:28.600 --> 08:33.266
Oh, wait!
It's Mamie! (gasps)

08:35.667 --> 08:37.934
Just under the buzzer, Rose.

08:39.066 --> 08:42.900
It was of great sentimental value,
Blanche. I assure you.

08:42.967 --> 08:45.233
We haven't found any music box.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.567
-Yes, we have--
-Shut up, Rose.

08:48.567 --> 08:53.200
I'm sorry you wasted a trip, but
we're not handing out free gifts today.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.867
Drop by in another 30 years.
We'll see what we can do.

08:59.633 --> 09:01.266
(door slams)

09:01.333 --> 09:04.033
They grow up so quickly, don't they?

09:08.033 --> 09:12.166
-I had a wonderful time tonight, Jack.
-Good. So did I.

09:12.233 --> 09:16.367
I don't ever go out on blind dates
but Ma was so insistent,

09:16.433 --> 09:19.266
and you sounded
so nice on the phone.

09:19.333 --> 09:23.867
I am nice, heh. They don't call them
correctional facilities for nothing.

09:25.600 --> 09:29.166
And a sense of humor, too.
(laughs)

09:29.967 --> 09:31.433
Ok.

09:33.567 --> 09:37.467
I bet we're both relieved Mrs. Contini
did a great job matching us up.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.834
Ah, I'll have to thank her in the morning.

09:39.900 --> 09:43.533
Wait. Could we back that up?
Who is Mrs. Contini?

09:43.600 --> 09:45.400
What do you mean,
"Matching us up"?

09:45.467 --> 09:48.166
Mrs. Contini,
the matchmaker who brought us together.

09:48.233 --> 09:50.900
I realize the process
is hopelessly old-fashioned,

09:50.967 --> 09:54.567
but it's more personal than
video-dating services, don't you think?

09:54.633 --> 09:58.266
I'm afraid there's been a mistake.
Uh, I think you'd better go.

09:58.333 --> 10:00.166
Wait! Can I see you again?

10:00.233 --> 10:04.266
Probably not. I'll be at the
Florida State Women's Prison.

10:04.333 --> 10:08.300
Oh, The one in Jacksonville?
They used to come to our dances.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.667
-Why you going there?
-Murder!

10:15.100 --> 10:18.100
Oh, you're going
to meet some great gals.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.033
-Hi, pussycat.
-Say goodbye, old woman.

10:32.834 --> 10:35.967
-Have a good time?
-Do I sound like I did?

10:36.033 --> 10:38.333
How should I know?
You're always like this.

10:39.266 --> 10:41.867
Your matchmaker set me up
with a criminal.

10:41.934 --> 10:43.500
White collar.

10:44.533 --> 10:48.133
Stop meddling in my life.
I'm sick of it.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.200
If I want a date, I can find one.

10:51.266 --> 10:54.967
Oh, Dorothy. (laughs)
Dear, sweet, delusional Dorothy.

10:55.767 --> 10:59.433
Blanche, I'm having a heart-to-heart
with my mother.

11:00.166 --> 11:03.567
Now listen up,
you withered old Sicilian monkey!

11:05.834 --> 11:09.533
I don't have to take this.
Next time, I'll take you to Shady Pines.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.867
-That's where I take you.
-Ouch!

11:11.934 --> 11:13.967
I guess I backed into that one.

11:17.734 --> 11:20.500
Blanche, what do I do
with Big Daddy's encyclopedias?

11:20.567 --> 11:23.400
Put them with the Bible
in the liquor cabinet.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.567
(doorbell rings)

11:30.700 --> 11:32.066
What are you doing here?

11:32.133 --> 11:35.500
I came here for more than a music box.

11:35.567 --> 11:38.567
It was wonderful to see you
after all these years.

11:38.633 --> 11:40.734
You're still my little dumpling.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.700
That's very sweet, but you're not
getting the music box!

11:44.767 --> 11:47.133
Blanche Marie Hollingsworth, sit down!

11:47.200 --> 11:50.266
-I'm not a little girl anymore.
-I said, sit!

11:52.266 --> 11:55.500
Blanche, that music box
is more important to me

11:55.567 --> 11:59.166
than you could possibly know,
I didn't give it to your family,

11:59.233 --> 12:02.967
I gave it to your father,
it was a special gift.

12:03.433 --> 12:07.900
-I don't understand.
-Blanche, I loved your father.

12:07.967 --> 12:10.233
Of course you did.
Everybody loved Big Daddy.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.800
No, I mean I loved your father.

12:15.867 --> 12:17.734
Get out of here!

12:19.900 --> 12:22.967
-We were lovers, Blanche.
-That's impossible.

12:23.033 --> 12:25.100
Big Daddy was a republican.

12:27.867 --> 12:32.500
These are letters he wrote me.
They're personal.

12:32.567 --> 12:35.000
I wouldn't have
another person read them,

12:35.066 --> 12:39.066
but they explain everything
better than I ever could.

12:39.133 --> 12:43.600
I'm sorry, Blanche.
I know this comes as a surprise.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.266
Look, Blanche.
(chuckles) Oh, hi.

12:47.333 --> 12:50.433
This picture of your parents,
what should I do with it?

12:55.300 --> 13:00.800
(slow music playing)

13:02.900 --> 13:05.567
-Mrs. Zbornak.
-Mrs. Petrillo.

13:06.767 --> 13:09.066
Oh, good. You two are talking.

13:10.133 --> 13:11.400
We're not talking.

13:11.467 --> 13:14.934
I'm still furious with ma
for hooking me up with that matchmaker.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.500
That reminds me of St. Olaf's
most famous matchmaker--

13:18.567 --> 13:20.867
Oh, please, Rose.
(sobs)

13:20.934 --> 13:25.934
Spare me the endless, inane details
of how Heidi Flugendugelgurgenplotz

13:26.000 --> 13:29.066
successfully matched a bull with a duck.

13:30.800 --> 13:35.033
And how their bull-duck daughter
ran a small tattoo parlor in Carmel.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.133
Honey, what's the matter?

13:46.066 --> 13:49.633
I just found out that Mammy Watkins
and Big Daddy had an affair.

13:50.700 --> 13:54.567
They were lovers
for over 50 years. (whimpers)

13:54.633 --> 13:57.266
And we can't get anybody
to do our windows.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.500
Honey, are you sure?

14:04.567 --> 14:07.767
Yes, Mammy gave me these letters
Big Daddy wrote to her.

14:09.800 --> 14:13.934
"I'd swim across many oceans
for a glimpse of your face.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.600
I'd climb the tallest mountains
for the sound of your voice.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.800
I'd walk a million miles
for one of your smiles."

14:27.567 --> 14:29.367
Seems authentic.

14:30.834 --> 14:32.133
I can't get over it.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.900
-Over what?
-San Juan Hill, Rose.

14:35.967 --> 14:39.934
Over the fact that her father
had an affair with her Mammy.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.200
-Oh...
-I don't know.

14:42.266 --> 14:45.200
This changes everything
I've ever thought about Big Daddy.

14:45.266 --> 14:49.433
I assumed he and mama
had a wonderful sex life.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.967
I walked in on them once
when I was little,

14:52.033 --> 14:55.600
there was all this huffing and puffing
and high-pitched sounds.

14:55.667 --> 14:58.567
Then suddenly Big Daddy shouted,
"Glory!"

14:58.633 --> 15:01.333
And they both lit up cigarettes.

15:03.600 --> 15:07.300
I vowed then and there,
I'd never do anything so repulsive.

15:07.367 --> 15:08.700
So what happened?

15:09.166 --> 15:12.633
Oh, Bobby Joe Porter explained to me
that the cigarette part was optional.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.433
Remember the time
you walked in on me?

15:19.500 --> 15:22.467
Oh, yeah. I still remember
what you said--

15:22.533 --> 15:24.867
"Mommy's sick. Get help."

15:27.533 --> 15:31.467
I would've died if I caught
my parents having sex.

15:31.533 --> 15:33.066
You never walked in on them?

15:33.133 --> 15:36.433
Once, but they were
only playing leapfrog.

15:47.467 --> 15:50.266
-Rose, have you seen Blanche?
-I think she's in her room.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.000
I need to talk to her.

15:52.066 --> 15:55.333
You always go to your mother
or Blanche to talk.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.433
No one ever talks to me. Why?

15:57.500 --> 16:02.033
Your advice always comes
with one of those St. Olaf stories.

16:03.033 --> 16:08.066
I can give advice without one.
Now, what's wrong?

16:08.133 --> 16:12.834
I don't think it was right of ma to hire
that matchmaker behind my back.

16:12.900 --> 16:16.233
Why does she always meddle in my life?

16:16.300 --> 16:21.500
I recently read about a man in Paris,
France.

16:22.967 --> 16:25.700
-Named--
-Rose.

16:26.100 --> 16:28.467
Pierre Frudenstoyfer.

16:28.533 --> 16:33.600
He worked in his father's herring,
no, quiche factory.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.467
And his father, Lars--

16:35.533 --> 16:38.300
Do I look like I just fell off
the turnip truck?

16:39.400 --> 16:43.767
No. But you do look like
the women who drove it.

16:46.867 --> 16:49.834
Her name was Ula Van Heflin.
No relation.

16:49.900 --> 16:52.200
Although she too collected string.

16:52.266 --> 16:54.600
-Well, one day--
-Rose, stop yourself.

16:54.667 --> 16:57.333
You're doing two of them
at the same time.

16:59.233 --> 17:02.300
I know and I'd like to try to handle it.

17:06.834 --> 17:09.967
I feel like Hans the plate-sinner.

17:10.033 --> 17:11.767
-Funny thing about--
-Rose!

17:12.934 --> 17:15.934
Oh, my God, I need help.

17:16.400 --> 17:21.033
You're headed for a meltdown.
Now make a point. Any point.

17:21.100 --> 17:24.967
The point of the story,
actually two of the stories,

17:26.166 --> 17:29.867
is that you let your pride
get in the way too often.

17:29.934 --> 17:33.934
Your mother did what she did
so you wouldn't be lonely.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.467
The idea of a matchmaker
is kind of sweet.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.667
Dorothy, can we talk?

17:42.400 --> 17:45.333
I just want you to understand
why I did what I did.

17:45.400 --> 17:50.367
I was wrong by not talking to you
before hiring a matchmaker.

17:50.433 --> 17:55.000
You see, where I come from,
matchmaking is an age-old tradition.

17:55.066 --> 17:59.333
For centuries, people have been
brought together by a third party.

17:59.400 --> 18:04.667
Ma, I understand. I really appreciate
what you're trying to do.

18:05.133 --> 18:09.133
Good. In keeping with that spirit,
I sold you to the Sultan of Fatah.

18:10.934 --> 18:13.233
-Ma.
-What? You're a substitute teacher.

18:13.300 --> 18:18.367
-It'll be just like the king and I.
-Why do you do this?

18:18.433 --> 18:21.100
-I want you to be happy.
-I am happy.

18:21.166 --> 18:25.266
I know you think there's something missing
from my life, but there isn't.

18:25.333 --> 18:30.900
If the right person comes along, great.
I don't need a man to be happy.

18:30.967 --> 18:32.467
I didn't realize that about you.

18:32.533 --> 18:35.734
On Mrs. Contini's questionnaire,
there's a box about that.

18:38.166 --> 18:41.767
-Anybody for barbecued chicken?
-We're out of charcoal, honey.

18:41.834 --> 18:44.300
Who needs charcoal?
That's what these letters are for.

18:44.367 --> 18:47.867
With that music box,
we'll have a big old fire.

18:47.934 --> 18:49.400
Blanche, what are you doing?

18:49.467 --> 18:52.233
I certainly can't let Mammy Watkins
have these things.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.600
That'd be giving my consent
to what happened.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.433
For my sake and mama's,
I cannot do that.

18:57.500 --> 19:02.066
Blanche, your father obviously
loved this woman.

19:02.533 --> 19:06.800
You loved this woman.
You'll feel better if you talk to her.

19:07.433 --> 19:11.266
All right, I'll talk to her,
but I can't promise anything else.

19:13.800 --> 19:18.400
-I once wrote some letters to my nanny.
-We know, Rose. She ate them.

19:22.934 --> 19:25.433
(soft music playing)

19:25.900 --> 19:27.633
(doorbell rings)

19:34.166 --> 19:36.700
-Thank you for coming.
-I'm glad you called.

19:36.767 --> 19:38.200
Please sit down.

19:46.767 --> 19:51.066
This has been difficult for me.
I want you to know I forgive you.

19:51.467 --> 19:53.433
I don't need your forgiveness.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.934
I'm not ashamed of anything
I've done.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.533
Your father and I were in love.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.734
We didn't mean for it to happen.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.734
In another time and place,
we would have been married.

20:03.800 --> 20:09.400
At that time, it wasn't an option.
And it wasn't only physical, either.

20:09.467 --> 20:13.133
You don't go through
what Curtis and I did just for sex,

20:13.200 --> 20:15.400
although that was reason enough.

20:16.533 --> 20:18.600
-(gasps)
-Blanche, did I shock you?

20:18.667 --> 20:22.333
Yes. I've never heard anybody call
Big Daddy by his first name before.

20:23.900 --> 20:27.600
He was the only man I ever loved,
and now he's gone. (sobs)

20:28.767 --> 20:31.967
I'd like to have the music box.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.500
No.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.233
Fine.

20:37.967 --> 20:40.834
Yeah, that's right.
Walk out, just like the last time.

20:40.900 --> 20:44.033
-What are you talking about?
-You didn't even say goodbye.

20:44.100 --> 20:48.033
I woke up one morning
and you were gone. I loved you.

20:48.100 --> 20:53.967
I spent the next few years wondering what
I'd done or said to make you leave me.

20:54.033 --> 20:56.233
So that's what this is all about.

20:56.300 --> 20:59.066
Honey, you didn't do anything wrong.

20:59.133 --> 21:04.000
I had to leave that night because your
mother found out about your father and me.

21:04.967 --> 21:09.633
You don't love a little girl for 10 years
and then just walk out of her life.

21:10.133 --> 21:12.567
Oh, face it.
You didn't care. (chuckles)

21:12.633 --> 21:17.900
Did you or did you not wear your very
first formal white with pink trim

21:17.967 --> 21:19.667
to the junior prom?

21:19.734 --> 21:23.133
And did you not come home
wearing a football jersey?

21:27.400 --> 21:29.500
It was dark in that hay loft.

21:31.033 --> 21:36.000
Your father and I spent many an hour
trying to figure out what to do with you.

21:36.066 --> 21:38.300
You drove that man to distraction.

21:38.367 --> 21:42.600
All right, maybe you talked about me.
That's not the same as being there.

21:42.667 --> 21:44.266
I know that.

21:44.667 --> 21:48.934
I remember a wedding reception,
early one June,

21:49.000 --> 21:51.367
when the most beautiful bride
I'd ever seen

21:51.433 --> 21:53.967
danced with her
equally handsome father.

21:54.367 --> 21:57.900
-You were there?
-The song was "Tennessee Waltz".

21:57.967 --> 22:02.667
You asked the band to play it twice
so you could dance with him longer.

22:03.467 --> 22:06.967
I stood in the back with the caterers
so no one would notice.

22:07.033 --> 22:07.934
(Blanche sobs)

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
You don't know how much
I wanted to hug you.

22:11.066 --> 22:14.867
(crying) I just had to see my dumpling
on her wedding day.

22:20.700 --> 22:22.467
(crying)

22:24.667 --> 22:25.767
(Blanche)
Here.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.800
I think Big Daddy would want you--

22:31.934 --> 22:36.633
-I want you to have this.
-Blanche, I don't know what to say.

22:36.700 --> 22:38.033
(chuckles)

22:38.100 --> 22:43.100
-This isn't that music box.
-That's the only music box there is.

22:43.166 --> 22:47.967
The music box I gave your father was
black enamel and played Stardust.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.600
<i>(Bonanza</i> theme playing)

22:57.967 --> 23:00.066
The theme from <i>Bonanza.</i>

23:01.834 --> 23:07.233
Well, then. I guess we went through
all this for nothing.

23:07.300 --> 23:10.133
Oh, I wouldn't say for nothing.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.433
(kisses)

23:11.500 --> 23:16.467
Then who the hell gave him
this music box?

23:16.867 --> 23:21.133
(slow music playing)

23:23.900 --> 23:27.834
(theme music playing)
