01:58.460 --> 02:02.660
Groups of unemployed workers, who have
grown in number due to the tax reforms...

02:02.700 --> 02:06.000
...enacted by the former Prime Minister,
are rioting all across the country.

02:06.030 --> 02:09.600
And with the confusion among members of
Parliament sparked by the comments of...

02:09.634 --> 02:12.970
...Finance Minister Takanashi
during a recent Parliament inquiry,

02:13.070 --> 02:15.561
there seems to be no compromise in sight
between the government and opposition.

02:17.612 --> 02:19.272
Hey. What'll it be?

02:19.482 --> 02:21.382
Give me three peanuts.

02:22.922 --> 02:24.682
Let's see here...

02:39.472 --> 02:41.802
We've herded those Clown
bastards onto Route 5.

02:45.073 --> 02:47.773
Damn it, don't scare me like that!
Open the damn door quietly!

02:47.813 --> 02:50.683
You wouldn't be so jumpy if you
didn't have something to hide!

02:53.614 --> 02:55.389
Try selling some normal
drinks sometime, huh?

02:55.424 --> 02:59.514
How about buying something for once?!
This ain't a hangout!

02:59.524 --> 03:01.224
And drink that dog piss you sell?!

03:05.364 --> 03:09.324
Twin ceramic rotor
drives on each wheel...

03:09.964 --> 03:14.305
And these are... Computer
controlled anti-lock brakes...

03:15.345 --> 03:18.105
200 horsepower at 12,000 rpm...

03:20.715 --> 03:22.645
You wanna ride it, Tetsuo?

03:23.345 --> 03:25.005
All right, let's go!

03:27.556 --> 03:31.246
That bike's been customized just for me.
It's too wild. You couldn't handle it.

03:32.326 --> 03:34.696
I don't see how you can ride
something like that, man.

03:36.826 --> 03:38.316
I could!

03:38.796 --> 03:41.596
If you want one so bad,
steal a big one for yourself.

04:47.741 --> 04:48.801
Unbelievable.

04:48.841 --> 04:50.971
School kids these days...

04:51.941 --> 04:53.431
Wait! Hey, waiter!

04:57.681 --> 05:00.151
They ran into the alley! After 'em!

05:13.862 --> 05:16.533
This isn't a game, you idiot!

05:19.743 --> 05:21.103
Shit...!

06:25.106 --> 06:26.367
That's...

06:27.177 --> 06:28.877
This is car 375.

06:28.917 --> 06:33.677
We've got reports of biker gangs fighting
near the intersection of Highway 14 south!

06:34.087 --> 06:37.387
Request immediate assistance!
Car 375, en route to the scene!

06:38.987 --> 06:40.318
It's the cops! What should we do?

06:40.558 --> 06:43.428
Damn, and my motor coils
Were just getting warmed up...

06:48.738 --> 06:50.258
Bastards...

06:50.468 --> 06:52.268
Let's go, Tetsuo!

06:52.538 --> 06:53.528
Right!

06:53.768 --> 06:55.708
Damn!

07:04.849 --> 07:08.009
A skirmish has broken out
Between student protesters...

07:08.049 --> 07:11.020
...and riot police assigned as security.
There appear to be some casualties.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.090
Furthermore...

07:29.040 --> 07:30.240
What the...?

07:33.110 --> 07:34.670
What the hell's going on?!

07:34.710 --> 07:37.311
Move it, jerk!
I'm in a hurry!

07:52.672 --> 07:54.192
What was that?!

07:54.232 --> 07:55.632
Call the police!

08:02.142 --> 08:05.172
Repeal the tax reforms!

08:21.864 --> 08:27.634
This area is off-limits!
Go back! It's dangerous!

08:28.104 --> 08:29.164
Something's strange here...

08:29.304 --> 08:31.134
Let me through!
I'm sorry, let me through!

08:31.174 --> 08:32.264
What's the big idea?

08:40.284 --> 08:41.684
Look! Blood!

08:42.855 --> 08:44.255
Who are they?

08:44.284 --> 08:45.515
- Excuse me.
- Hey! Don't push!

08:45.555 --> 08:46.315
Excuse me.

08:46.355 --> 08:48.186
Hey! Watch it, jerk!

08:51.636 --> 08:53.596
Pardon me. I'm sorry.

08:54.296 --> 08:55.236
Ryu!

08:55.706 --> 08:57.036
Hey! He ran away!

09:03.206 --> 09:04.476
He's got a gun!

09:10.187 --> 09:11.117
Fire!

09:13.917 --> 09:16.047
Hold your fire!
There's a kid with him!

09:26.268 --> 09:27.758
Run...

09:28.938 --> 09:30.168
Hurry...

09:34.978 --> 09:36.338
Go to Ryu...

09:36.878 --> 09:38.869
Ryu will help you now...

09:43.489 --> 09:46.279
Hurry... Get out of here...

10:18.521 --> 10:19.551
Kei!

10:21.861 --> 10:23.551
What are you doing? Hurry!

10:28.131 --> 10:29.891
He vanished...!

10:38.613 --> 10:40.343
He's to the west.

10:41.083 --> 10:44.073
The west? He's in
the old city, then.

10:55.063 --> 10:56.053
Eat this!

11:08.814 --> 11:10.365
Tetsuo!

11:49.557 --> 11:52.047
Ryu! Ryu, where are you?

11:55.997 --> 11:56.887
Kei!

12:23.759 --> 12:24.749
No, that's...!

12:46.350 --> 12:47.780
How you like that?!

12:57.061 --> 12:59.621
Well? Who is it?

12:59.761 --> 13:01.781
It's not him!
It's not Tetsuo!

13:02.501 --> 13:03.861
Okay! Let's go!

13:08.972 --> 13:13.772
You little...
What did you do...?

13:27.192 --> 13:29.312
Tetsuo!
Hang on! Hey!

13:32.232 --> 13:33.623
Huh? What did you say?

13:33.793 --> 13:35.734
That kid...

13:38.434 --> 13:40.024
He's hurt bad!

13:41.304 --> 13:43.534
Hey! Wait!

13:44.704 --> 13:45.764
We gotta get him to a hospital!

13:45.814 --> 13:48.774
- He needs an ambulance!
- We can't move him!

13:58.924 --> 14:00.284
W- What the hell?!

14:15.136 --> 14:17.196
There's no escape.

14:23.546 --> 14:25.346
We've come for you.

14:31.126 --> 14:36.527
We can't survive on the outside.
Come on, let's go home.

14:39.437 --> 14:41.397
It's the army!
Those are army helicopters!

14:48.848 --> 14:49.868
Move out!

15:01.258 --> 15:02.918
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!

15:03.258 --> 15:06.129
Um... We're just, uh...

15:06.159 --> 15:08.389
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!

15:17.939 --> 15:20.000
Ow... Damn it, that hurts!

15:20.310 --> 15:21.170
Kai!

15:27.480 --> 15:28.250
Hey!

15:28.280 --> 15:29.310
Sir?

15:29.490 --> 15:30.320
Who are they?

15:30.350 --> 15:32.340
They seem to be an
ordinary bike gang, sir.

15:48.641 --> 15:50.111
We're going back.

15:51.341 --> 15:53.101
Ow! Hey, wait a minute!

15:53.141 --> 15:55.082
My arms don't bend that way, damn it!

15:55.112 --> 15:57.312
Load the wounded onto the helicopter!

15:58.352 --> 15:59.412
Tetsuo!

15:59.452 --> 16:01.112
Wait! Where are you taking him?

16:02.052 --> 16:03.042
Kaneda!

16:03.792 --> 16:06.453
What the hell?
We didn't do anything!

16:06.963 --> 16:08.623
He's heavy...!

17:08.926 --> 17:14.827
So you and your friends went out at night
on your bikes to visit your dying mother,

17:15.367 --> 17:18.797
and a group of hooligans called the
Clowns picked a fight with you.

17:19.107 --> 17:21.467
They hurt your friend,
So you lost your temper,

17:21.567 --> 17:25.307
which is why eight Clown
members are now in the hospital.

17:25.337 --> 17:26.436
That's your story?

17:27.676 --> 17:28.737
She's cute!

17:30.347 --> 17:31.607
Hey! You can't look at this!

17:31.777 --> 17:33.118
And how's your mother doing?!

17:33.388 --> 17:34.718
Huh? Oh.

17:34.748 --> 17:37.088
Luckily, she made it through
the worst of it last night.

17:37.418 --> 17:40.478
And I suppose she's made it over
the mountains on a bike by now?

17:46.629 --> 17:48.329
It couldn't be these bozos.

17:48.369 --> 17:50.029
You can tell that just by looking.

17:51.799 --> 17:54.139
Wait on that bench. Understand?

17:54.739 --> 17:56.539
How much longer are we
gonna have to wait?

17:57.509 --> 17:59.709
Okay! The next five,
come get in here!

18:02.009 --> 18:04.350
So the army's working
with the police...

18:04.950 --> 18:07.480
...to hunt down anti-government
groups now, huh?

18:13.530 --> 18:15.460
- Wanna put up a fight, huh?
- He's holding something!

18:19.201 --> 18:20.791
Bastard!

18:22.971 --> 18:25.461
Long live the freedom revolution!

18:28.711 --> 18:29.871
He's got a grenade!

18:36.722 --> 18:38.382
Crazy son of a bitch!

18:45.632 --> 18:47.962
All right, that's enough!
Take him away!

18:49.102 --> 18:51.092
We'll really teach him a lesson later.

18:51.132 --> 18:54.733
You dumb bastard! If you wanna die,
just hang yourself or something!

18:55.003 --> 18:59.033
Hey! You people can go.
We've contacted your school.

18:59.743 --> 19:01.103
What? You son of a...

19:01.143 --> 19:02.474
Hey, hold on a minute, pops!

19:03.644 --> 19:05.084
"Pops"?!

19:05.214 --> 19:06.804
There was one more of us.

19:07.314 --> 19:07.944
What?

19:08.354 --> 19:09.284
Pardon me.

19:13.424 --> 19:14.584
What're you...

19:14.754 --> 19:16.854
This is her.
Can she leave with us?

19:17.194 --> 19:19.854
Who are you calling "Pops" you punk?

19:20.034 --> 19:20.694
Ow!

19:21.294 --> 19:25.564
Look here, kid! I'm only 25!
I'm not even married!

19:26.034 --> 19:29.335
So watch your mouth!
She can go with you!

19:31.305 --> 19:32.906
Call a doctor!

19:33.946 --> 19:38.606
So I think the army was chasing
that weird kid Kaneda saw...

19:38.686 --> 19:40.746
I think I saw him, too.

19:40.786 --> 19:42.376
And what about Tetsuo?

19:42.526 --> 19:44.986
Why the hell wouldn't they
tell us what hospital he's in?

19:45.086 --> 19:46.456
What did you say?!

19:46.696 --> 19:49.996
I was just wondering if you wanted to
grab some tea or something over there.

19:50.226 --> 19:54.926
I figured we could have a nice,
long talk about that "revolution" deal.

19:56.736 --> 19:59.436
Skirt-chasers will try
anything these days...

20:00.006 --> 20:02.877
You'll help anyone so long
as it's a girl, won't you?

20:02.907 --> 20:05.668
No way! I have high standards!

20:05.848 --> 20:08.748
It's not their looks that count.

20:08.778 --> 20:12.778
It's their... I dunno, their
sensitivity that makes me do it.

20:12.818 --> 20:16.878
I suppose I owe you one.
Thank you very much, uh...

20:17.128 --> 20:18.588
I'm Kaneda.
Nice to meet you.

20:18.628 --> 20:19.718
See you around, Kaneda.

20:21.198 --> 20:23.858
You're leaving already?
Don't be like that!

20:24.168 --> 20:28.068
Hey, come on!
I did save you and all!

20:32.779 --> 20:34.769
At least tell me your
name, you bitch!

20:37.749 --> 20:41.770
I'll try talking with them for
the time being, but it's risky.

20:42.150 --> 20:46.250
If they think you're trying to avoid taking
responsibility, it'll blow up in your face.

20:47.490 --> 20:50.430
I can't believe that there's a
mole on the executive council.

20:51.290 --> 20:52.780
Even if that's true...

20:53.060 --> 20:54.890
That isn't important.

20:55.100 --> 20:59.260
What's important is diplomacy and political
maneuvering, which you seem to despise.

20:59.570 --> 21:01.801
I never studied them in school, you see.

21:02.001 --> 21:04.971
In any case, at the next
executive council meeting,

21:05.011 --> 21:09.771
your poor management of this last
incident will be called into question.

21:13.751 --> 21:15.812
There's a phone call for the Colonel.

21:18.252 --> 21:21.022
You should put your affairs in order.

21:24.432 --> 21:25.362
It's me.

21:47.083 --> 21:48.573
This way, Colonel.

21:49.623 --> 21:51.594
I'm terribly sorry to call you here,

21:51.894 --> 21:54.554
but there's something
you really must see.

21:59.234 --> 22:00.595
Please observe.

22:00.735 --> 22:03.825
It's the special pattern
from that young boy.

22:03.975 --> 22:05.935
It doesn't resemble
any I've seen so far,

22:06.205 --> 22:08.975
and I've never seen a developmental
speed or configuration like this.

22:09.315 --> 22:13.445
It may have begun with the shock of
contact with Number 26, or possibly...

22:13.985 --> 22:16.475
Have you finished running a
comparison with Akira's pattern?

22:16.655 --> 22:18.515
I'll superimpose it over this one.

22:23.295 --> 22:28.286
This projection was constructed using
mixed data, so a comparison is difficult,

22:28.866 --> 22:32.997
but I believe this boy's
pattern is the key to solving...

22:33.037 --> 22:35.197
...the riddle of Akira's
pattern growth process.

22:35.977 --> 22:37.437
All right. Continue.

22:37.777 --> 22:39.437
Very well, sir. Thank you.

22:39.477 --> 22:42.677
I'm sure he'll turn out to be a
worthy addition to the Numbers.

22:44.577 --> 22:46.477
It may be rough on him,

22:46.517 --> 22:49.747
but I thought we might try starting
him off with level 7 capsules.

22:50.057 --> 22:51.147
Is it safe?

22:51.317 --> 22:52.547
Leave everything to me.

22:52.587 --> 22:53.747
That's not what I meant!

22:54.787 --> 22:59.728
I'm asking that if he turns out to
have power like Akira's like you said,

22:59.828 --> 23:03.029
will we be able to control it?

23:03.339 --> 23:05.029
Well, that's...

23:05.669 --> 23:07.159
Can I leave this to you?

23:07.469 --> 23:12.969
Well, if we use the latest examination
equipment to collect even more data...

23:13.009 --> 23:16.349
...and do a multifaceted
analysis, then surely...

23:19.149 --> 23:22.419
Maybe we shouldn't
touch that power.

23:23.459 --> 23:25.549
The power of God?

23:28.729 --> 23:31.460
A... ki... ra...

23:31.660 --> 23:37.160
But we have to.
We have to touch it and control it.

23:37.740 --> 23:41.541
If it looks like it's too much for us
to handle, terminate him at once!

23:41.671 --> 23:42.971
There can be no hesitation!

23:43.511 --> 23:45.031
Very well, Colonel.

23:46.111 --> 23:48.111
This school is your last chance!

23:48.751 --> 23:53.421
If trash like you that can't keep up with
the academic ability of regular students...

23:53.451 --> 23:57.291
...and can't adapt to living in a group
screw up here, it's the end of the road!

23:57.661 --> 24:01.112
Even if you're under 15, if you get more
than 50 penalty points on your record,

24:01.332 --> 24:03.522
you're sent to the regular courts!

24:03.662 --> 24:06.132
Bite me! Don't mess
with us, you bald goat!

24:06.172 --> 24:07.722
Aren't any of you listening?

24:07.772 --> 24:09.062
You lost me halfway through!

24:09.102 --> 24:10.332
Discipline!

24:10.372 --> 24:11.632
Discipline!

24:11.672 --> 24:12.932
- Discipline!
- OW!

24:12.972 --> 24:14.173
Discipline!

24:14.213 --> 24:15.433
Discipline!

24:15.473 --> 24:16.703
Discipline!

24:16.883 --> 24:17.903
Dismissed!

24:18.783 --> 24:21.753
Thank you very much, sir!

24:23.483 --> 24:26.823
You bastard! You and me are
gonna go at it someday, jack!

24:26.853 --> 24:27.883
We're gonna remember this!

24:27.923 --> 24:29.084
I hope you rot and die!

24:29.124 --> 24:30.684
You sick bastard!

24:30.894 --> 24:31.884
Shit...

24:37.534 --> 24:39.224
Yamagata!

24:39.274 --> 24:41.174
What happened to your cheek?

24:41.204 --> 24:42.224
Shut the hell up.

24:42.534 --> 24:44.474
Let me guess, Jaws from P.E.?

24:44.504 --> 24:47.374
They say you fought the Clowns
on a highway in the old city!

24:47.414 --> 24:47.804
Yeah.

24:47.844 --> 24:51.145
Why don't you just wipe 'em out?
Those guys are so gross!

24:51.185 --> 24:52.645
And last night...

24:52.785 --> 24:54.755
There were demonstrators,
cops, and even the damn army!

24:54.785 --> 24:56.585
And that idiot Tetsuo
had an accident, too.

24:56.825 --> 24:58.486
What happened to Tetsuo?

24:58.526 --> 25:00.496
He's in the hospital, I guess,
but we don't know where.

25:00.526 --> 25:02.786
The idiot was trying to show off.

25:05.826 --> 25:07.056
That idiot...

25:07.096 --> 25:08.796
What, you mean Tetsuo?

25:09.096 --> 25:11.436
Shut up! I've had enough
Of your damn flirting!

25:12.106 --> 25:13.896
What's gotten into you?!

25:29.388 --> 25:32.688
Tetsuo? It's time for your medication.

25:34.028 --> 25:36.258
Doctor! There's a problem!

25:40.638 --> 25:45.228
I can't. The dorm mother throws
a fit if you go out before ten.

25:45.468 --> 25:48.268
Yeah, the one with the face like a goat.

25:48.438 --> 25:52.208
That old bag's such a pain... She's
always yammering on and on and on.

25:52.478 --> 25:54.878
Tomorrow at three?
Sure, that'd be okay.

25:55.278 --> 25:57.979
Hey, what happened to
that girl a while back?

25:58.649 --> 26:02.320
I don't like her much. Her personality
just gets on my nerves.

26:02.690 --> 26:03.890
Kaori...

26:06.160 --> 26:07.460
Tetsuo!

26:08.060 --> 26:12.120
Everyone's been worried about you!
They thought you might be dead.

26:18.910 --> 26:23.240
When I woke up, I was on an
operating table or something.

26:23.510 --> 26:25.380
And that examination...

26:25.710 --> 26:29.671
It's like... they were messing
around inside my head.

26:30.251 --> 26:32.311
I don't want to go back there.

26:32.921 --> 26:34.321
Let's run away...

26:34.621 --> 26:35.821
Where?

26:37.462 --> 26:41.952
Someplace. Someplace far away.

26:44.932 --> 26:46.872
- What's your problem?
- That's mine!

26:46.902 --> 26:47.872
I wanna get laid!

26:47.972 --> 26:49.937
Hey! Today's independent study!

26:49.972 --> 26:54.942
Say what? What about
my burning desire to study?!

26:55.042 --> 26:56.242
Drag his butt in here!

26:58.053 --> 26:59.953
Kaneda! Your bike!

27:00.023 --> 27:01.143
My bike?

27:02.823 --> 27:03.813
Look!

27:07.493 --> 27:08.463
Tetsuo!

27:11.193 --> 27:12.394
Are you sure this is okay?

27:12.434 --> 27:14.454
Shut up! Just keep
quiet and hang on!

27:26.014 --> 27:26.945
Huh?

27:26.985 --> 27:28.075
What's wrong?

27:30.555 --> 27:31.545
Shit!

27:31.655 --> 27:32.580
Oh, no...

27:32.615 --> 27:35.125
We're stopping...
We stopped.

27:36.125 --> 27:40.995
Oh, okay. The engine can't drop below
5,000 even when you're changing gears.

27:41.025 --> 27:42.925
- My butt hurts.
- Okay, I get it...

27:43.495 --> 27:44.695
Look, bikes!

27:46.065 --> 27:47.796
Is that Kaneda and...?

27:48.006 --> 27:50.436
It's not them!

27:53.376 --> 27:54.366
Kaori!

27:58.247 --> 27:59.647
Any sign of him?

27:59.687 --> 28:01.707
Kuwata and the others went
to look around Kisarazu.

28:01.947 --> 28:04.647
All that's left now is
the industrial area!

28:04.887 --> 28:06.447
Okay, let's go!

28:09.657 --> 28:12.927
We owe you for the other night!

28:21.307 --> 28:22.397
Shut up!

28:25.639 --> 28:27.609
Kaori! What did they do, Kaori?!

28:34.689 --> 28:39.779
Don't! If you so much as scratch
that bike, I'm gonna kill you!

28:45.799 --> 28:47.029
Run!

28:47.069 --> 28:48.329
Don't let 'em get away!

28:55.310 --> 28:56.270
Wait!

29:06.081 --> 29:07.451
Tetsuo!

29:24.771 --> 29:27.172
That's enough, Tetsuo!
Are you trying to kill him?

29:27.212 --> 29:30.202
Yes! I'm gonna kill him!
I'll split his damn head open!

29:30.242 --> 29:31.712
Knock it off!.

29:32.042 --> 29:35.613
This happened because you
took my bike for a joy ride.

29:36.083 --> 29:36.953
Enough, already!

29:36.983 --> 29:39.953
Shut up! Don't order me around!

29:40.793 --> 29:42.193
We were worried about you.

29:42.493 --> 29:44.653
Why do you always have
to come and save me?

29:46.433 --> 29:50.623
I could've handled it myself!.
I admit I got beat up that one time,

29:51.033 --> 29:54.333
but I won't always be
on the receiving end!

29:54.874 --> 29:56.334
Understand?!

30:00.944 --> 30:02.034
Tetsuo...

30:03.584 --> 30:04.944
Shut up! Stay away from me!

30:07.954 --> 30:09.885
Hey, wait!
Where are you going?

30:11.685 --> 30:12.655
Leave me alone!

30:15.355 --> 30:16.345
Akira!

30:20.635 --> 30:21.525
Tetsuo!

30:24.966 --> 30:25.956
What's wrong?

30:27.076 --> 30:28.126
Akira!

30:28.176 --> 30:29.696
I don't know who that is!

30:52.567 --> 30:54.828
Tetsuo, are you...

30:54.938 --> 30:55.728
Hey!

31:00.708 --> 31:02.338
This is strange.

31:02.438 --> 31:04.638
I'm getting a blue
pattern on scope #3!

31:05.508 --> 31:08.568
Oh, no! Retrieve
the subject! Hurry!

31:22.399 --> 31:24.870
What're you doing to my friend?!

31:28.500 --> 31:32.130
What's with you? You just
come back from a funeral?

31:39.110 --> 31:40.050
Tetsuo!

31:40.650 --> 31:41.550
Kaneda!

31:43.420 --> 31:44.720
Shit...

31:54.261 --> 31:55.291
Wait!

32:02.342 --> 32:04.172
Hey, Kaneda...

32:15.822 --> 32:20.852
I see we have some youngsters doing their
thing in spite of the tight checkpoints.

32:21.292 --> 32:24.093
That just means that
they're stupid, don't it?

32:28.133 --> 32:31.623
This is boring.
Hey, let's go home.

32:32.604 --> 32:34.264
But it's still early!

32:34.304 --> 32:38.264
Yeah, but without their bikes they're
just skirt-chasers out of water.

32:38.314 --> 32:39.434
You mean "fish"!

32:39.544 --> 32:41.744
Come on, let's go.
Let's toss these fish back!

32:43.084 --> 32:46.484
Hey, Kaneda, what're we gonna do?

32:49.184 --> 32:49.954
What the...?

32:51.124 --> 32:52.094
Look!

33:17.986 --> 33:18.976
That's...

33:19.516 --> 33:22.487
Here we go again... Let's get out of
here before we get involved again.

33:23.497 --> 33:24.327
Huh?

33:25.457 --> 33:26.517
Kaneda?

33:26.567 --> 33:27.617
Hey!

33:29.167 --> 33:32.967
This area is being cordoned off
due to a terrorist bombing.

33:33.537 --> 33:35.367
Those who wish to get through,
line up in single file,

33:35.467 --> 33:38.407
present your ID and proceed
through the checkpoint.

33:49.418 --> 33:50.248
Get in.

33:50.818 --> 33:52.759
What's wrong? Hurry.
I'll be right behind you.

33:54.989 --> 33:56.259
You know the rendezvous point, right?

33:57.999 --> 34:00.759
- Be careful.
- You too, Ryu.

34:14.449 --> 34:16.109
Stop! Stop, damn it!

34:18.880 --> 34:20.150
She's got a gun!

34:31.831 --> 34:33.201
Okay, that's far enough!

34:34.101 --> 34:35.291
Drop the gun!

34:42.771 --> 34:43.931
Drop it now!

34:50.321 --> 34:51.411
Stop!

35:05.503 --> 35:07.163
I think it came from over here!

35:07.433 --> 35:09.233
- There were two shots!
- No, three!

35:09.273 --> 35:10.363
It's just up ahead!

35:11.003 --> 35:13.033
Hey. Let's get out of here.

35:13.843 --> 35:14.833
Come on!

36:21.518 --> 36:22.408
Kaneda!

36:48.539 --> 36:51.880
So, what's the matter?
Try telling me about it.

36:52.680 --> 36:54.770
I had a dream.

36:55.550 --> 36:56.880
A dream?

36:58.720 --> 37:03.160
The city will be covered by a dark
shadow and start to crumble.

37:03.930 --> 37:05.920
Lots of people died...

37:06.490 --> 37:10.230
...and we met Akira again.

37:10.900 --> 37:11.890
Akira?!

37:12.270 --> 37:18.541
The city will crumble,
and so many people will die...

37:19.441 --> 37:23.282
When?! When will it happen, Kiyoko?!

37:23.312 --> 37:25.582
You mustn't let that boy go.

37:26.352 --> 37:28.322
His power, it...

37:35.922 --> 37:37.022
What did she mean?!

37:37.062 --> 37:42.522
Well, there's nothing
physically wrong with her.

37:43.032 --> 37:44.502
Her medication is normal, too.

37:44.532 --> 37:48.022
There's no sign of any abnormalities
in her ECG or EEG, either.

37:49.242 --> 37:53.944
I think what Number 25 said was
her precognitive power at work.

37:54.914 --> 37:58.284
This must be presented to the supreme
executive council for inquiry, but...

37:59.784 --> 38:01.084
Do you believe her?

38:01.654 --> 38:03.914
I have no doubts regarding
Number 25's abilities.

38:04.124 --> 38:06.094
We have all sorts of data
that substantiate her abilities.

38:07.024 --> 38:08.684
What about you, Colonel?

38:09.764 --> 38:13.824
My job isn't to believe or disbelieve.
It's to act or not to act.

38:26.845 --> 38:27.645
Here, sir.

38:27.986 --> 38:31.616
Cold gear, Colonel.
Please put it on. You, too, Doctor.

38:43.566 --> 38:47.496
The other day, a young
researcher asked me something.

38:48.336 --> 38:52.467
He wondered if their power was the form the
next stage of human evolution was taking,

38:52.507 --> 38:56.497
and perhaps that we'll all
be able to control it some day.

38:58.117 --> 39:00.947
Scientists are a bunch of romantics.

39:01.047 --> 39:03.277
Military men always
consider the risks first.

39:04.218 --> 39:06.378
It's taken thirty long years.

39:06.858 --> 39:09.688
We've come so far from the rubble.

39:10.928 --> 39:12.948
We can't just trade one for the other.

39:13.098 --> 39:17.258
I've always thought that you
hated this city, Colonel.

39:17.898 --> 39:21.569
The passion to build has cooled and
The joy of reconstruction forgotten,

39:23.339 --> 39:26.639
and now it's just a garbage heap
made up of hedonistic fools.

39:27.309 --> 39:30.039
So you're trying to save the city, then.

39:31.219 --> 39:34.309
It's how a soldier thinks.
A scientist wouldn't understand.

39:38.459 --> 39:40.050
Colonel, we're here.

39:40.690 --> 39:41.750
This way, sir.

40:02.211 --> 40:05.551
Room 10, 148 degrees Kelvin.

40:05.981 --> 40:07.821
Fluctuation tolerance range, check.

40:08.721 --> 40:12.821
Room 9, 118 degrees Kelvin.
Fluctuation tolerance, check.

40:13.291 --> 40:15.232
Emergency power generator, check.

40:16.162 --> 40:16.892
Open it.

40:17.202 --> 40:18.063
Yes, sir.

40:18.633 --> 40:19.103
Uh...

40:19.133 --> 40:20.433
Go to the Control Room!

40:20.473 --> 40:21.453
Yes sir!

40:38.453 --> 40:43.723
Room 1 is at 0.0005 degrees Kelvin.
It's within tolerances.

40:44.463 --> 40:47.053
No abnormalities detected
in any of the rooms'...

40:47.093 --> 40:49.064
...Dewar Walls or in
the defense system.

40:49.564 --> 40:53.095
No abnormal atmospheric
concentrations or reactions recorded.

40:53.405 --> 40:55.375
All systems nominal, then?

41:05.145 --> 41:08.515
Look at what they abandoned
in their panic. They were afraid!

41:08.555 --> 41:10.915
They were too scared, so they
hid it away from the public.

41:11.155 --> 41:13.145
They forgot all shame and honor...

41:13.585 --> 41:17.456
...and cast off the civilization
and science we had created,

41:18.096 --> 41:22.326
and shut the lid of the Pandora's
Box they themselves had opened.

41:27.137 --> 41:27.837
Ryu!

41:27.877 --> 41:29.967
Hey, we're still young.

41:30.237 --> 41:32.437
I think we can start over.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.107
I'll go with you to the police.

41:34.317 --> 41:35.037
Ryu!

41:35.277 --> 41:36.837
Come on, turn yourself in!

41:36.877 --> 41:39.107
That was the first time you
ever killed somebody, right?

41:39.147 --> 41:39.777
Ryu!

41:39.817 --> 41:42.647
Anyway, once you've
purified your body and soul,

41:42.787 --> 41:44.517
let's go out for tea or something.

41:45.157 --> 41:47.248
Don't kick yourself over it, okay?

41:47.298 --> 41:50.728
What's done is done.
The guy's dead.

41:58.238 --> 41:59.098
Who're you?!

42:00.608 --> 42:03.009
Ryu! You're okay!

42:03.309 --> 42:04.839
- Kei, is that you?
- Ryu!

42:06.209 --> 42:07.339
Who's this?

42:08.379 --> 42:09.779
Who, me?

42:09.949 --> 42:15.719
Well, I guess saying I'm Kei's
boyfriend might be stretching it a bit.

42:16.119 --> 42:19.460
But we haven't gotten physical
or anything yet, understand?

42:19.690 --> 42:20.720
- Are you a spy?!
- No!

42:20.760 --> 42:21.460
Liar!

42:26.700 --> 42:28.130
Is he really okay?

42:28.440 --> 42:30.500
All I know for sure is
that he's not a spy.

42:32.010 --> 42:32.970
Ow...

42:35.210 --> 42:37.401
Sneak into their lab?!

42:37.451 --> 42:40.051
Are you serious? Don't you remember
the fiasco with that kid?!

42:40.086 --> 42:43.071
Last-minute orders.
Besides, the plan's already in place.

42:46.692 --> 42:48.682
The lab passes they
issue once a week...

42:49.662 --> 42:50.952
They're from Mr. Nezu?

42:51.692 --> 42:52.682
What's the objective?

42:53.162 --> 42:55.652
Detailed data on the new subject.

42:55.932 --> 42:57.452
New subject?

42:57.572 --> 43:03.772
Yes. Last week, on the night we tried
to abduct the subject called Number 26,

43:04.742 --> 43:08.612
a boy who was in an accident on an
old city highway was brought to the lab.

43:09.582 --> 43:11.772
Looks like he's a student at
a vocational training school,

43:12.182 --> 43:15.053
but he's now their new subject
for human experimentation.

43:19.554 --> 43:20.584
Ow!

43:20.824 --> 43:23.594
OW! What's the big idea?!

43:24.434 --> 43:25.084
You!

43:25.394 --> 43:26.884
He heard us! Let's kill him!

43:26.994 --> 43:27.654
Ryu!

43:27.704 --> 43:31.564
W- Wait a minute! Listen to me!
Listen to what I have to say!

43:31.774 --> 43:32.824
He saved me!

43:32.874 --> 43:33.994
Twice!

43:34.244 --> 43:36.104
Maybe it was just to get close to us.

43:36.304 --> 43:39.874
The guy who was in that accident in
the old city is a friend of mine!

43:39.914 --> 43:42.904
I know it's hard to believe,
but it's the truth!

43:43.044 --> 43:44.984
I was there when it happened!

43:45.855 --> 43:49.086
Don't they say the only foolish
questions are unasked ones?

43:49.886 --> 43:52.356
Huh? They don't?

43:53.826 --> 43:56.196
That's an intriguing story.

43:57.026 --> 43:59.866
Will you be taking the boy with you?

44:00.066 --> 44:04.406
He knows the subject, and I think we
can use him as a decoy if necessary.

44:04.806 --> 44:07.366
Neo Tokyo is going to change.

44:08.776 --> 44:13.836
In all respects, this city is saturated.
It's like an overripe fruit.

44:14.016 --> 44:16.817
And within it is a new seed.

44:16.847 --> 44:20.977
We only need to wait for the
wind which will make it fall.

44:21.027 --> 44:23.017
The wind called Akira!

44:24.198 --> 44:26.218
Ryu, look!

44:27.868 --> 44:28.933
What is it?

44:28.968 --> 44:31.628
We aren't the ones who will change it,

44:31.668 --> 44:34.368
but rather, those citizens
who hope for Akira will.

44:35.838 --> 44:39.438
That which is called science
perverts providence!

44:39.738 --> 44:42.078
That which is called progress
encourages extravagance!

44:43.148 --> 44:47.349
That which is called civilization
devastates the spirit of man!

44:47.689 --> 44:51.379
The time of atonement is upon us!

44:51.719 --> 44:53.659
The time of his awakening is nigh!

44:53.959 --> 44:57.259
The time of Lord Akira's
awakening draws near!

44:57.329 --> 45:00.665
Are your hearts prepared?!

45:00.700 --> 45:02.670
Holding meetings
here is prohibited!

45:02.705 --> 45:04.540
Break up this illegal gathering!

45:06.040 --> 45:08.400
Terrorist activities carried out by...

45:08.440 --> 45:11.900
...anti-government elements
have skyrocketed this month.

45:12.080 --> 45:16.141
The army, riot police, and even traffic
police have been fully mobilized.

45:16.311 --> 45:19.511
The overtime costs alone have
used up the public safety budget.

45:19.721 --> 45:22.081
And then there's the
abduction of Number 26!

45:22.191 --> 45:25.181
Isn't their existence supposed
to be highest of state secrets?

45:25.421 --> 45:28.621
No one's ever heard of" Peace and
Order" here in Neo Tokyo, then?

45:28.991 --> 45:32.551
And then there's this request of yours...

45:32.601 --> 45:37.592
...for further funding because of
subject Number 25's prediction.

45:37.642 --> 45:39.102
You must be joking!

45:39.202 --> 45:44.233
We Parliament members have been
begging the public to bear with us...

45:44.483 --> 45:48.913
...while we straighten out the former Prime
Minister's historic tax reform blunders,

45:49.783 --> 45:52.653
so where, exactly, are we supposed
to get that kind of money?!

45:52.883 --> 45:57.383
You've spent a fortune, and all we have to
show for it is that grotesque kindergarten!

45:57.623 --> 46:00.093
The Olympics are next year.
The postwar period is over.

46:00.223 --> 46:03.663
How much longer will you keep
spending money on some ghost?!

46:03.963 --> 46:07.123
I always said that we should've put
that money into the welfare program!

46:07.163 --> 46:08.293
Shut up, old man!

46:08.333 --> 46:09.233
What?!

46:09.333 --> 46:12.674
That power is starting to walk
around free as we speak.

46:13.204 --> 46:15.975
Unless we control it now,
we'll lose everything!

46:16.015 --> 46:18.605
Who do you think you're
talking to, youngster?

46:18.785 --> 46:21.475
It was your lack of policy that
started this mess in the first place!

46:21.815 --> 46:26.085
There's still no proof that the last
World War was caused by Akira!

46:26.455 --> 46:30.485
Won't you even try to
understand anything at all...

46:30.595 --> 46:32.325
...unless an Akira disaster
actually happens?!

46:32.595 --> 46:35.065
Has anyone actually
seen this "Akira"?

46:35.165 --> 46:37.155
Wasn't Akira Number 25?

46:37.195 --> 46:38.995
No, I think he was Number 21...

46:39.765 --> 46:42.565
The Colonel has lost sight
of his duty as a soldier.

46:43.676 --> 46:45.666
I've had reports that anti-government
elements are using...

46:46.046 --> 46:51.877
...this "Akira" madness of yours as an
excuse to whip up their terrorist fervor!

46:51.917 --> 46:53.507
No! That's not true!

46:54.017 --> 46:56.577
Then what about that Akira
world renewal movement?

46:56.657 --> 46:58.677
Wouldn't you say that
information's being leaked?

46:58.727 --> 47:01.957
World renewal movement?
End of the world, more like!

47:02.227 --> 47:05.997
Aren't you just using Akira as camouflage
to cover up your misconduct?

47:06.127 --> 47:07.097
What are you getting at?

47:07.967 --> 47:13.338
Colonel, we can no
longer leave the peace...

47:13.538 --> 47:16.528
...of Neo Tokyo to your
sole discretion.

47:16.678 --> 47:17.608
Right!

47:17.648 --> 47:20.978
You are to be put before
an inquiry committee.

47:21.018 --> 47:22.139
I agree!

47:26.089 --> 47:27.049
Excuse me!

47:27.919 --> 47:29.979
Colonel!
Colonel, where are you...

47:30.019 --> 47:32.649
Wait! This discussion isn't over yet!

47:32.689 --> 47:33.959
Explain yourself!.

47:33.989 --> 47:37.189
Are you trying to insult the
supreme executive council?!

47:37.229 --> 47:38.159
Colonel...!

47:38.199 --> 47:39.629
Wait, Colonel!

48:01.651 --> 48:03.551
W- Water...

48:36.183 --> 48:38.153
Hey, wait a minute...

48:38.193 --> 48:41.753
Isn't that cable replacement
scheduled for next week?

48:42.194 --> 48:45.724
The cable they ordered came in early.

48:45.764 --> 48:48.964
Besides, I'm going on vacation
at the end of the week.

48:49.964 --> 48:52.334
I've brought some workers with me, too.

48:53.304 --> 48:57.264
I could take it back, but the work's
gonna be done sooner or later.

49:02.984 --> 49:04.214
Okay, let's go.

50:35.150 --> 50:36.370
What the...?

51:05.812 --> 51:06.782
Milk?

51:15.453 --> 51:16.653
Stay away!

51:29.903 --> 51:30.703
Blood!

51:30.743 --> 51:31.764
I'm scared!

51:40.915 --> 51:42.045
Jerk!

51:42.915 --> 51:44.905
W- Who the hell are they?

52:40.578 --> 52:44.069
Room 887, Tetsuo Shima...

52:44.419 --> 52:46.219
A problem with the automatic lock?

52:51.629 --> 52:54.319
Hey! You can't just walk
off from your room!

52:59.699 --> 53:01.189
Come on, let's go back.

53:01.239 --> 53:04.029
What the hell happened?
What a mess!

53:27.161 --> 53:30.761
There are 58 blocks with circuits
that the computer won't display.

53:31.231 --> 53:35.131
Of those, nearly 40 are concentrated
on underground levels 7 and 8.

53:35.771 --> 53:36.791
That's probably the place.

53:39.212 --> 53:41.612
The central wiring shaft
should be up ahead.

53:41.942 --> 53:44.002
We should be able to use it to
go straight to the sublevels.

53:45.982 --> 53:48.382
Be careful, it's deeper in the middle.

53:49.282 --> 53:50.812
What a stink!

53:50.852 --> 53:51.682
Quiet!

53:51.722 --> 53:54.523
What? I said it stinks
because it stinks!

53:54.963 --> 53:57.193
- Is your nose busted?
- Hurry up and stay quiet!

53:59.233 --> 54:00.783
Damn! Hide!

54:01.903 --> 54:03.233
Huh? Where?

54:03.333 --> 54:04.823
What're you doing, you idiot?!

54:19.254 --> 54:20.274
They left?

54:20.924 --> 54:22.444
Looks like they've beefed up security.

54:22.654 --> 54:23.984
Must be that siren we heard.

54:24.394 --> 54:25.654
What should we do?
Scout around some?

54:25.854 --> 54:26.514
No.

54:27.354 --> 54:28.514
- Are you okay?
- Let's keep going.

54:28.624 --> 54:30.685
I want to check out their
security at the very least.

54:31.135 --> 54:32.115
All right.

54:32.265 --> 54:34.165
We've been spotted! Run!

54:35.165 --> 54:36.395
Shit!

54:36.435 --> 54:38.526
Don't! Don't shoot!

54:41.906 --> 54:45.806
Shimazaki! Shit!

54:45.846 --> 54:47.146
Forget about him! Run!

54:51.386 --> 54:52.646
What the hell is that?

54:54.486 --> 54:55.646
Here it comes!

54:56.656 --> 54:57.956
Forget it! You can't do any good!

55:03.696 --> 55:05.187
Die!

55:06.437 --> 55:08.098
This is Unit 304, Shaft H!

55:08.138 --> 55:11.468
Have encountered intruders and
am engaging! Request backup!

55:12.508 --> 55:13.598
Here it comes!

55:39.939 --> 55:40.840
Kei!

55:43.870 --> 55:44.900
Where's that gun?!

55:45.740 --> 55:47.400
Damn it...!

55:50.010 --> 55:50.910
Kaneda!

56:01.460 --> 56:02.930
Kei, this way!

56:04.190 --> 56:05.390
Hurry!

56:07.461 --> 56:09.331
Kaneda, hurry!

56:24.882 --> 56:26.042
Kaneda!

56:39.403 --> 56:41.023
The brakes!
Where are the brakes?!

56:41.603 --> 56:42.833
That's not it?

56:42.873 --> 56:44.833
This is the central wiring shaft!

56:44.873 --> 56:47.133
It's gotta be this one, then!

56:52.714 --> 56:54.914
Okay, I'm getting the hang of this!

56:55.684 --> 56:57.654
Ask the Colonel for
clearance to fire!

56:57.984 --> 56:58.784
Turn that up!

57:00.084 --> 57:01.554
There must be some mistake.

57:01.594 --> 57:03.884
That boy looks like the patient
They admitted to the lab.

57:04.324 --> 57:07.655
The boy, the subject named
Tetsuo Shima, broke out of his room.

57:07.695 --> 57:09.495
I think he's headed for the Baby Room.

57:09.795 --> 57:10.895
Tetsuo?!

57:10.965 --> 57:13.525
He is an extremely dangerous state!
Don't let him through!

57:13.865 --> 57:16.095
I repeat, do not let him through!

57:44.667 --> 57:45.757
What the...?

57:53.447 --> 57:55.237
It's no use hiding.

57:55.277 --> 57:57.147
We have no choice, then.
Use your guns!

57:57.477 --> 57:59.947
We can't let him go any farther,
no matter what it takes!

58:01.757 --> 58:03.088
Fire!

58:42.801 --> 58:45.061
So, here you are...

58:50.601 --> 58:51.871
Stop it!

58:54.111 --> 58:56.911
How long are you gonna
keep playing around?!

59:03.851 --> 59:05.792
Where'd the other one go?

59:07.292 --> 59:08.382
Why, you...

59:10.022 --> 59:11.222
Die!

59:13.963 --> 59:14.933
Takashi!

59:25.643 --> 59:30.303
What the hell is going on?
Am I dreaming or something?

59:30.943 --> 59:34.113
I never knew I had powers like this!

59:41.394 --> 59:43.414
Damn it, which way should I go?!

59:43.964 --> 59:47.264
Straight. Straight ahead...

59:47.564 --> 59:48.434
Huh?

59:48.664 --> 59:50.655
There's a freight elevator.

59:52.705 --> 59:55.265
We can take it to sublevel 8.

01:00:03.885 --> 01:00:06.406
Good, you're all together.

01:00:08.056 --> 01:00:10.816
You thought you could kill me?

01:00:11.726 --> 01:00:15.756
You tried to mess with me...
I'm gonna kill you!

01:00:21.536 --> 01:00:23.796
That was you...

01:00:23.966 --> 01:00:24.766
Takashi!

01:00:25.407 --> 01:00:26.897
Attack him together!

01:00:27.437 --> 01:00:29.167
O- Okay.

01:00:33.918 --> 01:00:35.938
You little twerps!

01:00:52.298 --> 01:00:53.788
That's enough!
All of you!

01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:04.080
Who the hell are you?!

01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:11.020
What's the matter? Does your
head hurt, Tetsuo Shima?

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:13.090
Your power isn't fully matured.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.280
If you push yourself, you might
do irreparable damage.

01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:17.360
Just do as we tell you.

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:22.390
What the hell did you
people do to my head?!

01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:32.900
Calm yourself, Tetsuo Shima!

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.671
He can't control it.

01:01:40.222 --> 01:01:41.282
What?!

01:01:41.322 --> 01:01:46.622
She said that big people like you
should never use the power like that.

01:01:47.062 --> 01:01:48.822
She says something
horrible will happen.

01:01:49.632 --> 01:01:51.322
Mind your own business.

01:01:54.102 --> 01:01:57.662
What? More powerful than me?

01:01:59.902 --> 01:02:04.273
He's the one! He's been popping
in and out of my head lately!

01:02:05.143 --> 01:02:08.043
Where is he?!
Where's this "Akira"?!

01:02:08.083 --> 01:02:08.573
What?!

01:02:08.613 --> 01:02:12.144
Kiyoko said that
you'll awaken Akira.

01:02:12.954 --> 01:02:15.474
If that happens, no one will
be able to stop him.

01:02:15.924 --> 01:02:17.654
So before that can happen,
we have to stop you.

01:02:17.694 --> 01:02:19.594
Impossible! Akira's already...

01:02:19.624 --> 01:02:22.294
WHERE IS HE?!

01:02:23.764 --> 01:02:24.754
Stop it!

01:02:25.104 --> 01:02:26.224
Shut up!

01:02:32.144 --> 01:02:35.905
Threat level to facility
integrity has passed level 7.

01:02:35.945 --> 01:02:39.035
Enacting disaster protocols.

01:02:40.115 --> 01:02:43.715
Threat level to facility
Integrity has passed level 7.

01:02:43.755 --> 01:02:46.845
Enacting disaster protocols.

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:48.316
What the...?!

01:02:55.766 --> 01:02:57.066
Hands up!

01:03:00.306 --> 01:03:02.206
Where the hell is the " Baby Room"?!

01:03:14.647 --> 01:03:16.087
Oh, no! Run!

01:03:21.287 --> 01:03:23.658
Gangway, coming through!
Coming through!

01:03:23.698 --> 01:03:25.288
Damn it, move!

01:03:27.268 --> 01:03:28.528
Kiyoko...

01:03:48.419 --> 01:03:50.119
Damn, that hurt...

01:03:50.389 --> 01:03:53.519
Kaneda? What're you doing here?

01:03:56.759 --> 01:03:59.660
Tetsuo! Are you okay?
I'm here to rescue you!

01:04:02.141 --> 01:04:05.901
Hurry up, you moron! If we don't get out
of here, those guys outside are gonna...

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.171
There he is! Catch him!

01:04:12.611 --> 01:04:14.671
Stay away from me!

01:04:18.891 --> 01:04:19.981
Kaneda!

01:04:22.621 --> 01:04:25.061
Oh, right. I forgot you
were there, Kaneda.

01:04:27.091 --> 01:04:29.061
That's okay, Kaneda.

01:04:29.301 --> 01:04:32.862
I won't be needing you
to save me anymore.

01:04:33.872 --> 01:04:36.603
From now on,
I'll be saving you.

01:04:36.773 --> 01:04:39.743
All you have to do is ask, Kanny.

01:04:40.073 --> 01:04:44.533
Say what? Who the hell do
you think you're talking to?!

01:04:45.853 --> 01:04:48.343
You don't like the way I talk?

01:04:48.753 --> 01:04:50.273
Does it make you mad?

01:04:50.323 --> 01:04:51.813
Well, what're you
gonna do about it?!

01:04:52.023 --> 01:04:55.653
Huh, Kaneda?! What're
you gonna do about it?!

01:05:05.304 --> 01:05:10.105
That's enough!
Don't hurt anyone else!

01:05:12.115 --> 01:05:14.075
Where's this "Akira" guy?!

01:05:14.775 --> 01:05:16.215
He...

01:05:16.985 --> 01:05:20.005
The Olympic stadium...?
In an underground facility?

01:05:20.315 --> 01:05:23.345
No! You're wrong! Akira is...

01:05:25.595 --> 01:05:26.485
Wait!

01:05:36.736 --> 01:05:40.966
What the hell?
I can do this, too?!

01:05:47.177 --> 01:05:49.007
Kiyoko, are you okay?

01:05:49.317 --> 01:05:51.077
It doesn't look like she's hurt.

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:53.847
What about you, Masaru?
You're bleeding.

01:05:54.057 --> 01:05:55.387
What happened to him?

01:05:55.887 --> 01:05:57.327
He flew away.

01:05:57.357 --> 01:05:59.447
How can he have so much power...?

01:06:02.298 --> 01:06:05.428
How could this have happened?
Is anyone here?

01:06:06.238 --> 01:06:09.498
He's developed so much
power in such a short time...

01:06:10.068 --> 01:06:11.768
Find him! Find Tetsuo!

01:06:12.308 --> 01:06:15.708
- Find him! Go after him!
- Kaneda! Hang on, Kaneda!

01:06:15.748 --> 01:06:18.338
Hurry up!
Get that rubble cleared!

01:06:20.718 --> 01:06:22.479
He went to where Akira is.

01:06:22.519 --> 01:06:26.419
What?
You're all safe!

01:06:26.559 --> 01:06:30.290
He's heading for the facility below
the Olympic construction site.

01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:31.730
How did Tetsuo find out about that?!

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.100
You mean he's gone outside?

01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:45.630
Damn it! We'll follow him!
Prepare for pursuit!

01:06:45.810 --> 01:06:46.870
- Yes sir!
- He's heading west!

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:49.770
He's heading for the
Olympic construction site!

01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:52.780
Tell them to beef up their security!

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:54.550
- You...!
- Set up checkpoints on all...

01:07:01.022 --> 01:07:04.932
According to the defense team, intruders
were encountered in the wiring shaft.

01:07:05.502 --> 01:07:07.332
Two disguised as workers resisted
and were shot, and the rest are at large.

01:07:07.362 --> 01:07:10.092
He has to be stopped
Before his powers mature...

01:07:12.642 --> 01:07:14.932
Your objective is the boy Tetsuo Shima.

01:07:15.572 --> 01:07:18.672
If we are unable to capture him, you will
lure him out to the old city and attack.

01:07:19.012 --> 01:07:20.872
Request assistance from the
Eastern District Battalion.

01:07:21.442 --> 01:07:21.912
Yes sir!

01:07:21.952 --> 01:07:23.672
Tell them there isn't a moment to lose!

01:07:26.482 --> 01:07:28.252
I've been waiting for you, Colonel.

01:07:29.853 --> 01:07:30.843
Who the hell are you?!

01:07:33.264 --> 01:07:36.854
I'm here to inform you of the supreme
executive council's decision.

01:07:39.204 --> 01:07:43.534
At 2400 hours today, the Colonel is hereby
stripped of his command and rank,

01:07:43.574 --> 01:07:45.564
and will be placed under arrest.

01:07:45.974 --> 01:07:46.874
What?!

01:07:48.144 --> 01:07:49.334
Please come with us.

01:07:50.674 --> 01:07:54.404
You expect me to hand Neo Tokyo
over to those fools at a time like this?

01:07:57.754 --> 01:07:58.985
- Shoot him.
- Yes sir!

01:07:59.225 --> 01:08:00.205
What?

01:08:01.185 --> 01:08:02.415
W- Wait!

01:08:04.155 --> 01:08:08.096
Enough! Open your eyes and
look at the big picture!

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:10.656
We can't dance to the tune of
corrupt politicians and capitalists!

01:08:15.506 --> 01:08:18.566
Don't you understand?!
It's pointless to fight anymore!

01:08:23.316 --> 01:08:27.305
Announce a state of emergency, arrest
all members of the executive council...

01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:29.546
...and remove them from
the chain of command!

01:08:30.487 --> 01:08:32.187
We're going after Tetsuo!

01:08:32.357 --> 01:08:35.987
Urgent message to all district
battalion commanders!

01:08:46.008 --> 01:08:47.858
Hey, what's up?
You by yourself?

01:08:51.928 --> 01:08:54.368
Weren't you in an
accident or something?

01:08:54.468 --> 01:08:57.627
Everybody's been worried.
So, you feeling better?

01:08:58.068 --> 01:09:00.269
Gimme some... capsules.

01:09:01.779 --> 01:09:05.509
Hey, are you sure about that?
You don't look so hot.

01:09:05.549 --> 01:09:07.309
Just hand 'em over!

01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:10.408
All right, if you say so.

01:09:10.849 --> 01:09:14.479
But with all those demonstrations and
terrorist attacks lately, things are rough.

01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:19.180
They're hard to come by,
so they're pretty expensive.

01:09:25.569 --> 01:09:30.031
Tetsuo's run off, Kaneda's disappeared...
I guess the team's finished.

01:09:30.310 --> 01:09:35.441
And the checkpoints are so strict,
even the Clowns are staying put.

01:09:45.151 --> 01:09:46.321
What's wrong?

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.051
He's dead!

01:09:51.191 --> 01:09:51.991
What?!

01:09:54.632 --> 01:09:55.792
What the...?

01:10:01.503 --> 01:10:02.633
Tetsuo?

01:10:02.813 --> 01:10:06.543
What are you doing here?

01:10:07.643 --> 01:10:10.043
You want some, too?

01:10:10.483 --> 01:10:13.973
What are you talking about, damn it?!
What the hell happened here?!

01:10:14.083 --> 01:10:15.883
The barkeep's dead!

01:10:19.723 --> 01:10:22.383
A fish out of water dies, huh?

01:10:22.763 --> 01:10:27.224
You are Tetsuo... Aren't you?

01:10:28.904 --> 01:10:31.035
Kaneda sends his regards.

01:10:31.135 --> 01:10:32.435
You saw Kaneda?!

01:10:32.675 --> 01:10:35.305
He's probably dead by now...

01:10:38.375 --> 01:10:41.905
You did this, Tetsuo?

01:10:41.945 --> 01:10:46.315
So anyway... Where's Kaneda's bike?

01:10:46.525 --> 01:10:47.415
Tetsuo!

01:10:48.785 --> 01:10:50.985
I don't need a piece of junk
like that anymore...

01:10:51.025 --> 01:10:52.395
You son of a...

01:10:58.136 --> 01:10:59.036
Yamagata!

01:11:06.147 --> 01:11:07.977
Shit...

01:11:14.987 --> 01:11:16.547
He went to where Akira is?

01:11:16.887 --> 01:11:18.357
That's what that girl said.

01:11:19.087 --> 01:11:23.217
The army, you, and Ryu are all
looking for this "Akira" guy,

01:11:23.527 --> 01:11:25.427
so that's why you're
chasing after Tetsuo.

01:11:25.827 --> 01:11:28.098
It has something to do with
that power of Tetsuo's, right?

01:11:30.098 --> 01:11:32.088
What the hell is this "Akira"
thing you keep talking about?

01:11:35.338 --> 01:11:39.568
Ryu told me about it once.
He said that Akira is absolute energy.

01:11:40.348 --> 01:11:41.709
Absolute energy?

01:11:42.379 --> 01:11:46.039
Humans do all kinds of things
during their lifetime, right?

01:11:46.419 --> 01:11:50.319
Discovering things, building things...

01:11:51.319 --> 01:11:57.700
Things like houses, motorcycles,
bridges, cities, and rockets...

01:11:58.930 --> 01:12:01.830
All that knowledge and energy...
Where do you suppose it comes from?

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:07.200
Humans were like monkeys once, right?

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.470
And before that, like reptiles and fish.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:15.350
And before that, plankton and amoebas.

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:19.521
Even creatures like those have
incredible energy inside them.

01:12:19.991 --> 01:12:23.151
Because of genes, I guess.

01:12:23.421 --> 01:12:27.692
And even before that, maybe there
were genes in the water and air.

01:12:28.592 --> 01:12:30.532
Even in space dust, too, I bet.

01:12:31.202 --> 01:12:34.892
If that's true, what
memories are hidden in it?

01:12:35.672 --> 01:12:39.372
The beginning of the universe, maybe.
Or maybe even before that.

01:12:39.512 --> 01:12:43.312
Hey, what's the matter?
Are you okay?

01:12:43.512 --> 01:12:45.912
Did you get hit on
the head back there?

01:12:46.052 --> 01:12:49.212
Maybe everyone has those memories.

01:12:49.852 --> 01:12:52.482
What if there were some mistake
and the progression went wrong,

01:12:52.793 --> 01:12:57.124
and something like an amoeba
were given power like a human's?

01:12:59.034 --> 01:13:00.864
That's what Akira is?

01:13:01.694 --> 01:13:04.324
Amoebas don't build
houses and bridges.

01:13:05.004 --> 01:13:07.634
They just devour all
the food around them.

01:13:07.834 --> 01:13:11.964
That's what Tetsuo's doing?
You're saying he has that kind of energy?!

01:13:12.574 --> 01:13:17.074
A long time ago, there were people
who tried to control that power.

01:13:17.244 --> 01:13:19.614
At the government's request, you see.

01:13:19.654 --> 01:13:24.084
They failed, and it
triggered the Fall of Tokyo.

01:13:25.154 --> 01:13:28.816
That power is still too much for...

01:13:31.396 --> 01:13:32.386
What?!

01:13:33.166 --> 01:13:34.526
The door's unlocked.

01:13:38.266 --> 01:13:39.256
Huh?

01:13:44.476 --> 01:13:47.006
This has got to be a trap.

01:13:47.576 --> 01:13:48.676
Go back, then.

01:13:48.716 --> 01:13:52.086
No, we ought to find out
how much of it is a trap...

01:13:54.716 --> 01:13:58.847
By the way, what's with
you and that Ryu guy?

01:13:59.897 --> 01:14:01.917
- What do you mean?
- You're always together.

01:14:01.957 --> 01:14:03.798
That's none of your business!

01:14:04.798 --> 01:14:08.498
What I'm saying is, he doesn't
know about us, does he?

01:14:09.738 --> 01:14:10.638
" Us"?

01:14:10.668 --> 01:14:13.068
Hey, wait a minute!
What's that supposed to mean?

01:14:14.108 --> 01:14:15.508
Do you think this will work?

01:14:15.578 --> 01:14:21.638
It can't be helped. At this point,
our only option is to use her.

01:14:22.118 --> 01:14:28.719
The fact that she turned up right under
our noses says as much, I think.

01:14:29.059 --> 01:14:30.079
I guess...

01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:47.560
Have arrived at Ward 13,
East Ginza intersection. Over.

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:51.040
Northern District battalion has not
responded to mobilization request.

01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:54.411
Special search team to HQ!
Special search team to HQ!

01:14:54.451 --> 01:14:57.781
We're at the Haruki-ya snack bar near
the highway interchange in Ward 8.

01:14:58.891 --> 01:15:04.121
It doesn't look like a bomb explosion,
so we think it was him.

01:15:04.931 --> 01:15:08.231
It was almost certainly the work of the
subject that escaped from the lab.

01:15:08.761 --> 01:15:11.061
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
Understood!

01:15:18.312 --> 01:15:19.302
Kaneda!

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:22.842
What?! Yamagata's dead?!

01:15:23.052 --> 01:15:25.813
Something seemed strange about
him from the second I saw him.

01:15:25.953 --> 01:15:28.383
He was wearing what looked
like a white hospital gown.

01:15:28.883 --> 01:15:31.053
It was like he was
a different person.

01:15:31.893 --> 01:15:36.263
Yamagata asked him if
he was really Tetsuo.

01:15:36.963 --> 01:15:40.903
And then... Yamagata, he...

01:15:44.303 --> 01:15:46.293
We've always been together.

01:15:46.903 --> 01:15:52.604
I've known everything about him
since we were in the children's home.

01:15:53.384 --> 01:15:56.715
He was a klutz, and
everybody made him cry.

01:15:58.315 --> 01:16:01.915
Oh, right... He wanted to
know where your bike was.

01:16:02.825 --> 01:16:04.385
My bike...?

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:14.235
What're you gonna do?

01:16:15.605 --> 01:16:17.965
I'm gonna send Yamagata his bike.

01:16:22.515 --> 01:16:24.846
You dumb bastard!

01:16:28.247 --> 01:16:29.237
Kaneda!

01:16:45.697 --> 01:16:46.687
Kei!

01:16:47.767 --> 01:16:48.767
What's wrong?

01:16:52.878 --> 01:16:55.898
You! You were there that night...

01:16:59.318 --> 01:17:00.178
Wait!

01:17:06.559 --> 01:17:07.549
Kei!

01:17:11.629 --> 01:17:13.129
They disappeared!

01:17:14.829 --> 01:17:17.829
You were the ones who changed
Tetsuo too, weren't you?

01:17:18.369 --> 01:17:22.429
Akira's power exists within everyone.

01:17:23.410 --> 01:17:24.470
Who's there?!

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:31.740
But when that power is awakened,
you must choose how to use it,

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:36.090
even if you weren't prepared for it.

01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:41.221
And he has made his choice.

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:46.291
Tetsuo is our newest companion.

01:17:47.901 --> 01:17:51.891
We're partly to blame for his actions.

01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:54.802
Why did you take Kei, then?!

01:17:55.342 --> 01:17:57.972
We want her to help us.

01:17:58.112 --> 01:18:01.012
You can't just use people like that!
Bring Kei back!

01:18:01.452 --> 01:18:05.472
Tetsuo's our friend! If anyone's
gonna kill him, it should be us!

01:18:08.252 --> 01:18:09.352
Hey!

01:18:10.762 --> 01:18:11.752
Damn it!

01:18:12.292 --> 01:18:16.023
Mr. Omi and the other executives
have been arrested by the coup...?

01:18:16.603 --> 01:18:17.623
Y- Yes, that's right.

01:18:17.863 --> 01:18:19.923
The house guards are
fighting them right now.

01:18:20.473 --> 01:18:21.263
Yes.

01:18:21.874 --> 01:18:23.864
I'd like to have a helicopter
waiting at West Haneda.

01:18:24.574 --> 01:18:25.264
Yes.

01:18:26.414 --> 01:18:29.604
That damned Colonel...
I can't believe he's taken up arms.

01:18:32.784 --> 01:18:34.214
I underestimated him.

01:18:38.984 --> 01:18:40.614
Hold them here! Damn!

01:19:11.586 --> 01:19:12.886
Mr. Nezu...

01:19:13.956 --> 01:19:16.686
R- Ryu?! Is that you?

01:19:16.926 --> 01:19:18.416
I'm sorry, sir...

01:19:18.826 --> 01:19:21.026
The mission was a failure.

01:19:21.437 --> 01:19:22.597
What are you doing here?!

01:19:23.237 --> 01:19:25.228
I've told you, you can't be seen here!

01:19:26.678 --> 01:19:28.338
All of my men...

01:19:28.808 --> 01:19:30.708
They've all been killed.

01:19:30.748 --> 01:19:34.268
Y- You sold me out,
didn't you, you bastard?!

01:19:34.318 --> 01:19:35.438
What? You can't be...

01:19:39.388 --> 01:19:41.188
Kei...

01:19:46.628 --> 01:19:49.528
I got fresh fish in here, buddy!
I'm gonna get compensated for 'em, right?

01:19:49.568 --> 01:19:52.969
Please, I have to catch a flight at noon!

01:19:53.739 --> 01:19:54.459
What?

01:19:55.339 --> 01:19:57.029
7th Avenue is just ahead!

01:19:57.439 --> 01:19:59.269
It intersects this road
100 meters from here!

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:05.240
Prepare for battle!

01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:16.560
Right, we've spotted the subject.

01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:20.320
What? Attack?!

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:23.891
But he's just a...
We're attacking a boy?!

01:20:28.201 --> 01:20:29.361
Look! There he is!

01:20:29.401 --> 01:20:30.171
Impossible!

01:20:30.211 --> 01:20:31.471
Is this for real?

01:20:43.652 --> 01:20:45.182
Firing preparations complete.

01:20:48.022 --> 01:20:49.892
Damn it! Fire!

01:21:03.343 --> 01:21:05.313
- Akira!
- It's Lord Akira!

01:21:05.343 --> 01:21:07.143
It's the advent of Lord Akira!

01:21:08.313 --> 01:21:09.833
That's not him!
Don't be fooled!

01:21:10.113 --> 01:21:11.144
That's not Lord Akira!

01:21:11.184 --> 01:21:12.554
Shut up!

01:21:13.454 --> 01:21:15.354
Long live Lord Akira!

01:21:16.794 --> 01:21:17.844
Fire!

01:21:19.194 --> 01:21:20.185
Huh?

01:21:20.225 --> 01:21:21.315
What's wrong?

01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:51.685
Neo Tokyo Broadcasting is
exclusively covering the news...

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:54.380
...in spite of martial law in the
name of freedom of the press!

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.591
What in the world is happening
here in Neo Tokyo?

01:22:58.801 --> 01:23:01.531
What you see here seems to be
fires caused by tank cannons.

01:23:01.771 --> 01:23:04.701
But who is this young boy?

01:23:04.801 --> 01:23:07.671
Is he fighting the coup
forces all by himself?.

01:23:08.111 --> 01:23:14.141
Viewers, the army has just
illegally ordered us to land!

01:23:14.611 --> 01:23:15.671
Freedom of the press
is now in jeopardy!

01:23:16.951 --> 01:23:18.251
What happened?
Were they cut off?

01:23:19.422 --> 01:23:21.322
The bridge! He's heading
for the bridge!

01:23:23.192 --> 01:23:24.552
Let's go see!

01:23:41.213 --> 01:23:43.073
Are you really going alone?

01:23:44.213 --> 01:23:46.403
He wants this, doesn't he?

01:23:47.013 --> 01:23:49.244
We should call the gang together.

01:23:50.224 --> 01:23:50.914
Hey!

01:23:51.624 --> 01:23:53.484
I wouldn't want to keep him waiting.

01:23:55.854 --> 01:23:57.954
Hey, Kaneda! Wait!

01:24:05.104 --> 01:24:07.224
Half seem to be
anti-government demonstrators.

01:24:07.534 --> 01:24:11.875
The rest are... Well, they're more
like some crazy cult than onlookers.

01:24:12.075 --> 01:24:14.735
They're following after the subject,
and more and more keep coming.

01:24:18.516 --> 01:24:22.746
Oh, flames of purity,

01:24:22.786 --> 01:24:25.256
raze this corrupt city!

01:24:25.456 --> 01:24:30.186
Consume our unclean hearts!

01:24:31.026 --> 01:24:33.426
Fear not!

01:24:33.566 --> 01:24:38.366
Your bodies will be
purified in the flames!

01:24:39.876 --> 01:24:40.856
Ready!

01:24:43.246 --> 01:24:44.106
Fire!

01:24:50.188 --> 01:24:52.878
Set the switch to hold for three
seconds and converge your beams!

01:24:54.058 --> 01:24:54.988
Aim!

01:24:55.258 --> 01:24:56.188
Fire!

01:25:02.258 --> 01:25:04.158
Watch this!

01:25:10.108 --> 01:25:11.768
Look out!
Let's get out of here!

01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:24.680
Help me!

01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:33.450
Ground forces!
Ground forces, come in!

01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:35.860
Report! What is the subject's status?!

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.220
Ground forces!

01:25:39.630 --> 01:25:40.830
Call the Doctor.

01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:44.360
We have confirmation of his recent
movements and are in pursuit.

01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:46.740
His present position is... Let's see...

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:51.641
Coordinates 99871 by 4332.

01:25:52.251 --> 01:25:56.012
That'sabout2kmsouth of the Olympics
construction site in the old city.

01:25:56.052 --> 01:25:57.042
What?!

01:26:02.622 --> 01:26:04.062
What was that?

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:05.632
Look!

01:26:06.702 --> 01:26:09.162
That's near the toll booth that's
being guarded by the 2nd platoon.

01:26:10.472 --> 01:26:11.452
Wha...?

01:26:13.032 --> 01:26:14.092
Huh?

01:26:16.813 --> 01:26:20.743
Please turn around!
This area's off limits to civilians!

01:26:20.783 --> 01:26:23.113
What? That's the subject?!

01:26:23.413 --> 01:26:24.743
S- Stop!

01:26:24.983 --> 01:26:26.173
Stop, damn it!

01:27:32.117 --> 01:27:34.177
Nice place you have here.

01:27:41.967 --> 01:27:44.728
Wait, you were with Kaneda.

01:27:44.898 --> 01:27:48.929
You shouldn't use your power this way.

01:27:49.539 --> 01:27:50.409
What?

01:27:50.679 --> 01:27:55.139
In the end, you won't
be able to control it.

01:27:55.509 --> 01:27:56.569
The kids...

01:27:57.019 --> 01:27:58.379
You're those brats, aren't you?!

01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:18.531
Okay, then...!

01:28:40.661 --> 01:28:41.721
What the...?

01:28:53.312 --> 01:28:54.363
It's not safe here, Colonel!

01:29:35.715 --> 01:29:38.155
Well, what're you gonna do?

01:31:05.150 --> 01:31:06.240
Open up!

01:31:17.462 --> 01:31:19.152
What the hell?

01:31:19.562 --> 01:31:22.162
That's Akira, Tetsuo!

01:31:22.532 --> 01:31:25.802
That's the "Akira"
you wanted to meet.

01:31:25.902 --> 01:31:28.372
There's your Messiah!

01:31:28.702 --> 01:31:30.902
After his transcendental awakening,

01:31:31.272 --> 01:31:35.682
his body was subjected to
every test known to science.

01:31:36.112 --> 01:31:39.982
And that's what was left of it.

01:31:49.163 --> 01:31:53.154
The scientists back then were
unable to solve the mystery,

01:31:53.464 --> 01:31:57.734
so they decided to entrust their
collected data and test samples...

01:31:57.774 --> 01:32:01.134
...to future generations by
preserving them in a frozen capsule.

01:32:03.304 --> 01:32:04.904
SOL... We'll use SOL!

01:32:04.944 --> 01:32:05.934
Sir?

01:32:08.044 --> 01:32:10.574
Akira is already dead!

01:32:11.154 --> 01:32:14.175
Well? Are you satisfied now, Tetsuo?

01:32:19.225 --> 01:32:21.555
So come back with us!

01:32:21.725 --> 01:32:22.825
Like hell!

01:32:24.135 --> 01:32:25.925
Contact the central defense center...

01:32:26.135 --> 01:32:29.766
...and tell them to patch us
through to SOL's control circuits!

01:32:29.906 --> 01:32:30.666
Yes sir!

01:32:46.927 --> 01:32:48.787
Hey, watch it!

01:32:48.957 --> 01:32:52.657
Damn it, move!
Get out of the way!

01:33:09.438 --> 01:33:11.959
What is this, science class?

01:33:29.059 --> 01:33:31.849
What's wrong?
Have some trouble?

01:33:32.289 --> 01:33:35.319
Yeah, but I already took care of it.

01:33:36.059 --> 01:33:38.159
If you were here earlier,
you could've watched the show.

01:33:38.199 --> 01:33:40.260
You had me worried again.

01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:44.061
I figured you'd be standing here,
sobbing like a little baby.

01:33:44.341 --> 01:33:47.971
Kaneda, you've always
been a pain in the ass.

01:33:49.081 --> 01:33:53.171
You've been telling me what
to do ever since we were kids.

01:33:53.851 --> 01:33:55.641
You always treat me like a kid.

01:33:56.051 --> 01:33:58.381
You always show up and
start bossing me around!

01:33:58.951 --> 01:34:01.011
And now you're a boss, too...

01:34:01.051 --> 01:34:02.991
Of this pile of rubble.

01:34:03.121 --> 01:34:04.111
Kaneda!

01:34:04.461 --> 01:34:06.821
That's Mister Kaneda to you, punk!

01:34:07.131 --> 01:34:09.391
Die!

01:34:18.813 --> 01:34:20.173
Tetsuo!

01:34:43.834 --> 01:34:45.204
Son of a...

01:34:59.255 --> 01:35:00.145
Kei!

01:35:02.225 --> 01:35:03.245
Oh, hell!

01:35:07.295 --> 01:35:09.155
Let's do it!

01:35:20.536 --> 01:35:21.936
Got him!

01:35:23.346 --> 01:35:24.236
Huh?

01:35:29.417 --> 01:35:30.407
The battery?!

01:35:30.987 --> 01:35:32.647
What's the matter, Kaneda?

01:35:34.317 --> 01:35:36.757
God damn it!
This ain't fair, Tetsuo!

01:35:36.857 --> 01:35:38.487
Fight with your bare hands!

01:35:41.728 --> 01:35:43.158
Oh, this is funny...

01:35:44.898 --> 01:35:46.458
Feeling frustrated, Kaneda?

01:35:47.498 --> 01:35:50.498
Now do you understand how it feels?

01:35:56.948 --> 01:35:58.878
What's this light?

01:36:09.789 --> 01:36:10.820
Well, did you hit him?

01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:13.960
We're too close to the impact point.
There's too much electrical interference.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.490
Prepare a second volley!

01:36:38.451 --> 01:36:42.952
Hey! Kaneda!

01:37:01.242 --> 01:37:03.912
Tetsuo!

01:37:19.504 --> 01:37:20.554
Shit...

01:37:21.304 --> 01:37:22.664
Huh?

01:37:22.804 --> 01:37:23.794
What the...?

01:37:59.706 --> 01:38:01.506
Correcting for tracking system error.

01:38:01.546 --> 01:38:03.036
T- minus-20 to energy alteration.

01:38:03.576 --> 01:38:05.066
- Fire extinguishers!
- Are you okay?

01:38:05.116 --> 01:38:05.636
Hurry! Hurry!

01:38:05.916 --> 01:38:08.006
What happened?
What's going on?

01:38:17.297 --> 01:38:19.027
Kaneda!

01:38:20.697 --> 01:38:22.067
Kai! Kei!

01:38:22.097 --> 01:38:23.297
- Kaneda!
- Kaneda!

01:38:23.638 --> 01:38:24.498
Get on!

01:38:24.538 --> 01:38:25.768
Get on? Where?

01:38:25.808 --> 01:38:26.928
Hurry! Hurry!

01:38:49.629 --> 01:38:50.559
What's that?

01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:07.140
They say it's SOL.

01:39:18.091 --> 01:39:19.461
Magnificent...

01:39:29.501 --> 01:39:33.131
When Tetsuo's power reaches its peak?

01:39:33.711 --> 01:39:34.932
That's when we do it.

01:39:35.612 --> 01:39:37.973
But will it work?

01:39:39.113 --> 01:39:43.643
The future doesn't proceed
along a single course.

01:39:44.183 --> 01:39:47.713
There ought to be a
future we can choose.

01:39:57.663 --> 01:39:59.133
What's Tetsuo's status?

01:39:59.403 --> 01:40:00.733
Ah. Colonel...

01:40:01.433 --> 01:40:04.373
We set up a camera in the
stadium a while ago.

01:40:04.903 --> 01:40:06.273
We have him under observation.

01:40:08.074 --> 01:40:11.675
Colonel, you must take
a look at this data!

01:40:12.355 --> 01:40:15.145
We're still analyzing the energy
given off by the subject, but...

01:40:15.525 --> 01:40:18.485
It's magnificent.
Absolutely magnificent.

01:40:18.555 --> 01:40:21.085
This is clearly a proton collapse.

01:40:21.425 --> 01:40:25.195
We're also detecting a fair number of
what we believe to be unknown particles.

01:40:25.595 --> 01:40:28.425
If we can put this into a
theoretical framework, physics...

01:40:28.635 --> 01:40:29.895
No, science...

01:40:30.065 --> 01:40:33.065
Humanity itself could touch the
fundamental truths of the universe!

01:40:35.505 --> 01:40:36.705
Oh. That's...

01:40:37.376 --> 01:40:39.276
We still haven't finished
making our adjustments.

01:40:40.076 --> 01:40:41.406
Uh, Colonel!

01:40:47.087 --> 01:40:48.847
T- That's...!

01:40:52.127 --> 01:40:54.597
You bastard!
What did I tell you?!

01:40:54.627 --> 01:40:55.957
B- But, Colonel!

01:40:56.397 --> 01:40:59.127
I couldn't throw away such
a magnificent subject!

01:41:00.467 --> 01:41:01.457
Shut up!

01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:26.559
Shit! It's on fire!

01:41:26.999 --> 01:41:28.159
The battery! The battery!

01:41:28.299 --> 01:41:30.959
My bike! It's burning up!

01:41:31.369 --> 01:41:33.929
Hey, what's a bike or two?

01:41:33.969 --> 01:41:36.940
What? Then there's nothing wrong
with using yours, right?

01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:39.300
You heard that?

01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:40.570
Yeah, I did!

01:41:40.610 --> 01:41:42.100
Hey, your bike's still on fire.

01:42:24.052 --> 01:42:25.042
Tetsuo?

01:42:37.234 --> 01:42:41.604
Tetsuo, why does everyone
call you "Akira"?

01:42:41.704 --> 01:42:44.644
He never existed in the first place.

01:42:46.284 --> 01:42:48.304
They didn't care who it was.

01:42:50.954 --> 01:42:52.884
Just so long as he destroyed things.

01:42:53.954 --> 01:42:54.944
Your arm!

01:42:56.454 --> 01:42:59.654
It doesn't look like much,
but it works pretty good.

01:43:03.294 --> 01:43:05.285
What's wrong? Are you okay?

01:43:08.135 --> 01:43:09.156
It's nothing!

01:43:09.876 --> 01:43:10.736
Tetsuo...

01:43:10.776 --> 01:43:12.326
Shut up! Just go away!

01:43:20.246 --> 01:43:21.516
Medicine...

01:43:22.656 --> 01:43:25.316
What's wrong, Tetsuo?
Are you in pain?

01:43:26.026 --> 01:43:29.316
Go back to the lab and get
me some of that medicine!

01:43:29.756 --> 01:43:31.416
Did you hear that, Doctor?

01:43:31.596 --> 01:43:32.786
Yes, Colonel.

01:43:33.026 --> 01:43:34.726
Well? Can you see any signs of it?

01:43:35.397 --> 01:43:37.427
I'm not entirely certain,

01:43:37.997 --> 01:43:41.407
but it seems that the power that had been
held back by the drugs is breaking free.

01:43:42.407 --> 01:43:45.608
He may not be able to control power
that has awakened so suddenly.

01:43:46.008 --> 01:43:48.208
At any rate, he's in an
extremely dangerous condition!

01:43:49.478 --> 01:43:53.378
If you don't go back to the lab and
receive proper treatment, you may die.

01:43:56.918 --> 01:44:00.408
You want me to enroll in that
kindergarten and live happily ever after?

01:44:00.858 --> 01:44:06.159
Take my medicine every day
and shrivel up like those kids?!

01:44:11.699 --> 01:44:12.689
Kaori...

01:44:13.509 --> 01:44:14.399
Kaori...

01:44:15.779 --> 01:44:19.139
Please... I need that medicine...

01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:20.740
No...!

01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:22.710
Tetsuo!

01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:25.580
Tetsuo!

01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:28.620
Tetsuo...

01:45:01.092 --> 01:45:01.992
Kaneda?!

01:45:40.595 --> 01:45:41.495
Huh?

01:45:49.305 --> 01:45:50.795
Son of a...

01:45:54.915 --> 01:45:56.905
You kids... What are you doing here?

01:46:03.186 --> 01:46:04.986
You never learn, do you?

01:46:07.357 --> 01:46:08.517
Tetsuo!

01:46:23.347 --> 01:46:24.777
Takashi...

01:46:27.517 --> 01:46:28.737
Akira...

01:46:42.329 --> 01:46:45.729
Kaneda...? H-Help me...!

01:46:55.509 --> 01:46:56.839
Kaori...

01:47:00.519 --> 01:47:02.750
Help me...!

01:47:14.530 --> 01:47:16.090
Help me!

01:47:16.570 --> 01:47:17.961
Stop it!

01:47:35.582 --> 01:47:36.552
Kaori?

01:47:36.592 --> 01:47:37.782
Kaori!

01:47:38.052 --> 01:47:39.352
Kaori!

01:47:39.622 --> 01:47:41.822
Tetsuo? Is that you, Tetsuo?!

01:47:42.422 --> 01:47:45.262
Kaori! Kaori's gonna die!

01:47:45.592 --> 01:47:47.822
What?! What did you say?!

01:47:48.402 --> 01:47:50.492
My body's not doing what I tell it to!

01:47:51.072 --> 01:47:52.902
My power's acting on its own...!

01:47:53.703 --> 01:47:55.403
Kaori!

01:47:56.173 --> 01:47:57.803
Kaori's dying!

01:47:58.373 --> 01:48:00.543
Kaneda, help me!

01:48:00.713 --> 01:48:02.114
Stop, Tetsuo!

01:48:02.784 --> 01:48:04.044
Stop it!

01:48:04.984 --> 01:48:08.384
Kaori's pain is coming into me...!

01:48:10.394 --> 01:48:12.754
Tetsuo!

01:48:12.994 --> 01:48:16.864
Kaneda! Run away!

01:48:29.845 --> 01:48:31.976
Tetsuo!

01:48:43.826 --> 01:48:47.126
Kiyoko! Takashi! Masaru!
Get away from here!

01:48:51.966 --> 01:48:53.126
Come on!

01:48:59.606 --> 01:49:01.877
I can't believe it. It's as if...

01:49:14.988 --> 01:49:17.828
Kiyoko! Taka...

01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:56.130
Hi, Akira.

01:50:05.041 --> 01:50:06.711
Th-This is...

01:50:08.181 --> 01:50:10.411
But that's... Oh, no!

01:50:19.832 --> 01:50:21.052
W- Where am I?

01:50:22.462 --> 01:50:24.362
Hurry! Get into the tunnel!

01:50:24.802 --> 01:50:26.202
You'll be safe in there.

01:50:26.232 --> 01:50:27.822
Kiyoko! Where are you?

01:50:42.853 --> 01:50:44.443
Tetsuo!

01:50:44.853 --> 01:50:47.053
Kaneda!

01:50:47.453 --> 01:50:48.353
Hang on!

01:50:50.893 --> 01:50:52.084
If you don't get out of
here now, you'll...

01:50:52.124 --> 01:50:53.254
Out of the way!

01:50:53.534 --> 01:50:55.024
Tetsuo!

01:50:55.064 --> 01:50:56.324
Don't go!

01:51:03.575 --> 01:51:05.475
No, Takashi!

01:51:06.145 --> 01:51:09.115
If you went in now,
you'd be trapped, too.

01:51:09.685 --> 01:51:13.015
But none of this is his fault!

01:51:20.555 --> 01:51:21.755
Takashi!

01:51:21.895 --> 01:51:23.085
Takashi!

01:51:29.907 --> 01:51:35.777
If we went in, we wouldn't be
strong enough to come back out.

01:51:37.077 --> 01:51:40.907
But if the three of us worked together,
maybe we could at least save that boy.

01:51:41.347 --> 01:51:42.647
You're right.

01:51:43.047 --> 01:51:44.517
Together, the three of us could...

01:51:53.757 --> 01:51:55.317
Oh, man...!

01:51:55.897 --> 01:51:58.197
We should get out of here. Hey!

01:51:59.468 --> 01:52:00.658
Kaneda...

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:37.360
Look, you're not revving
your engine enough.

01:52:37.410 --> 01:52:40.741
When you go into a corner, lean like
you're trying to kill yourself. Watch!

01:52:41.211 --> 01:52:42.841
What're you doing?

01:52:42.881 --> 01:52:44.571
Cornering, man.

01:52:46.381 --> 01:52:48.351
Got it, Tetsuo...?

01:52:54.391 --> 01:52:56.121
Look, there's another one!

01:52:56.331 --> 01:52:58.491
- Another transfer student?
- He was abandoned.

01:52:58.632 --> 01:53:00.292
You can see it in his face.

01:53:04.402 --> 01:53:09.062
Are... Are these your dreams, Tetsuo?

01:53:10.942 --> 01:53:11.932
Wait!

01:54:29.488 --> 01:54:32.258
This is Akira...?

01:54:32.698 --> 01:54:35.328
Yes. We called him.

01:54:36.068 --> 01:54:38.328
To have him take Tetsuo away.

01:54:38.368 --> 01:54:41.358
Take him away?
Take him where?

01:54:41.768 --> 01:54:43.798
It's too much for Tetsuo.

01:54:44.178 --> 01:54:46.768
And for us. And for Akira.

01:54:47.808 --> 01:54:50.838
It's too big for us as we are now.

01:54:51.578 --> 01:54:54.518
But someday, we'll
also be able to...

01:54:55.588 --> 01:54:58.019
You see, it's already begun.

01:54:58.819 --> 01:55:00.820
Your friend's...

01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:02.420
My friend?

01:55:03.930 --> 01:55:06.490
Kei! You mean Kei, don't you?

01:55:32.561 --> 01:55:33.621
Tetsuo...

01:55:38.802 --> 01:55:40.262
This is yours, right?

01:55:46.472 --> 01:55:50.412
They're always like that with the new kids.
You came today, right?

01:55:50.882 --> 01:55:52.172
They beat me up, too.

01:55:52.582 --> 01:55:55.072
But the truth is,
those guys are wimps.

01:55:55.882 --> 01:56:00.113
I'm Tetsuo. Tetsuo Shima.

01:56:01.853 --> 01:56:04.853
To tell you the truth,
I just got here myself.

01:56:05.023 --> 01:56:06.123
I'm...

01:56:07.033 --> 01:56:08.363
Kaneda...

01:56:09.763 --> 01:56:10.823
Kaneda?

01:56:12.034 --> 01:56:12.764
Kaneda!

01:56:12.804 --> 01:56:13.534
Kei?

01:56:39.865 --> 01:56:42.695
W- What's happening?
What in the world is happening?

01:56:45.765 --> 01:56:47.706
B- But this isn't...

01:56:48.276 --> 01:56:52.366
If this is correct, it's almost as if...
Is this the birth of a universe?!

01:56:58.917 --> 01:57:01.857
Kei!

01:57:07.657 --> 01:57:09.057
What happened?

01:57:11.467 --> 01:57:13.827
It's disappearing...!
It's disappearing!

01:58:25.112 --> 01:58:27.672
Kaneda!

01:58:50.833 --> 01:58:52.093
Tetsuo...

01:58:55.144 --> 01:58:56.194
Kaneda...

01:58:58.144 --> 01:58:59.334
Thanks.

01:59:00.984 --> 01:59:03.604
You called to me, right?
I heard you.

01:59:11.125 --> 01:59:13.495
Kaneda, don't tell me you're...

01:59:14.265 --> 01:59:15.625
What about Tetsuo?

01:59:16.665 --> 01:59:18.095
He left.

01:59:19.465 --> 01:59:21.095
So did those three kids.

01:59:21.635 --> 01:59:22.765
Akira, too.

01:59:22.935 --> 01:59:25.236
Kaneda, back then, you...

01:59:27.206 --> 01:59:31.406
Kaneda! You're alive?!

01:59:32.346 --> 01:59:36.946
I thought you were
in there for sure!

01:59:39.286 --> 01:59:40.346
Tetsuo...

01:59:40.386 --> 01:59:41.916
What happened to Tetsuo?

01:59:42.556 --> 01:59:43.746
Is he dead?!

01:59:43.996 --> 01:59:47.057
I'm not so sure.
But he's probably...

02:00:13.118 --> 02:00:15.988
But someday, we'll
also be able to...

02:00:17.028 --> 02:00:19.498
You see, it's already begun.

02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:41.810
I am... Tetsuo.
