01:39.659 --> 01:42.494
Lucrezia.

01:45.065 --> 01:47.833
What have I done?

01:47.901 --> 01:50.836
Will God ever forgive me?

01:53.640 --> 01:58.244
God may forgive you father,
but I never will.

02:01.748 --> 02:03.682
Lucrezia!

02:03.750 --> 02:08.687
[Moaning softly]

02:11.424 --> 02:14.927
Lucrezia!

02:27.741 --> 02:31.777
Lucrezia!
[Breathing hard]

02:45.792 --> 02:48.227
You didn't snore.

02:50.130 --> 02:52.598
But you wept...

02:52.699 --> 02:55.868
all night.

02:55.969 --> 02:58.070
That has to stop.

02:59.973 --> 03:02.708
And you bled, thank God.

03:02.776 --> 03:08.981
A virgin. You must be unique
in your family.

03:09.082 --> 03:10.612
"A Borgia," they said.

03:10.637 --> 03:12.337
"Is that how little I am
valued?" I said.

03:12.385 --> 03:14.787
"The pope's daughter,"
they said.

03:14.821 --> 03:17.890
"For shame," I said.

03:17.991 --> 03:21.960
Your dowry was worthy
of a <i>princessa.</i>

03:21.995 --> 03:26.165
Lucrezia Borgia Sforza.
[Stifled sob]

03:26.232 --> 03:29.134
Do you hunt?

03:29.169 --> 03:32.671
No? Well, that's good.

03:32.772 --> 03:36.508
Then we need hardly
see each other.

03:36.576 --> 03:39.778
Except when
marital duties call.

03:39.846 --> 03:42.514
And then I'll keep them brief

03:42.615 --> 03:46.151
and business-like.

03:48.154 --> 03:51.690
[Door opening and closing]

03:51.825 --> 03:54.960
[Sobbing]

03:58.264 --> 04:00.265
Oh, go away.

04:00.333 --> 04:03.635
Do nightmares ever plague
the vice-chancellor?

04:03.703 --> 04:07.172
Hm. The very office is
a nightmare, Your Holiness.

04:07.207 --> 04:10.709
Of plots, petty intrigues
and petitions,

04:10.810 --> 04:15.180
which I do my utmost to keep
from your presence.

04:17.050 --> 04:21.452
I need your assurance...

04:21.553 --> 04:24.556
of the welfare of my daughter...

04:27.460 --> 04:30.629
...in the castle of your cousin,
Giovanni Sforza.

04:30.730 --> 04:33.966
You suspect
she is ill used?

04:34.033 --> 04:37.069
Our nightmares tell us so.

04:37.137 --> 04:41.407
He will be putty in
her soft hands, Your Holiness.

04:41.508 --> 04:44.977
Yes, he inherited
the Sforza name,

04:45.044 --> 04:48.414
the Sforza wealth,
but none of its vigour.

04:48.548 --> 04:51.917
And the Sforza appetite
for intrigue?

04:52.018 --> 04:55.821
Hmm. Yes, well.
Yes, that he did inherit.

04:55.889 --> 04:59.525
But intrigue is no match
for Borgia intelligence

04:59.592 --> 05:02.194
as whole Rome has discovered.

05:04.097 --> 05:08.000
So, I need your
further assurance that...

05:08.067 --> 05:09.935
he and another cousin,

05:10.036 --> 05:13.105
the Duke of Milan,
will be constant

05:13.206 --> 05:16.742
in their support
for our papacy.

05:18.611 --> 05:21.947
We have merged our fortunes

05:22.015 --> 05:26.285
with the Sforza name.

05:26.352 --> 05:28.720
The consequence

05:28.788 --> 05:32.458
of that trust being betrayed

05:32.592 --> 05:35.461
would be most severe.

05:38.998 --> 05:42.434
- Do you speak to me as
vice-chancellor, Your Holiness?

05:45.605 --> 05:49.741
No. As a Sforza.

05:56.049 --> 05:59.084
[Bells ringing
distantly]

06:16.135 --> 06:17.803
My eyes...

06:17.937 --> 06:21.206
You can believe them,
Cardinal.

06:21.307 --> 06:24.943
I asked to confess to you,
in person.

06:25.044 --> 06:29.381
But I must confess,
I have nothing to confess.

06:29.482 --> 06:32.484
Then why?

06:32.585 --> 06:34.653
Because I had to see you.

06:34.754 --> 06:37.990
And I had to see you

06:38.091 --> 06:40.125
but couldn't you have chosen
a more personable venue?

06:41.995 --> 06:43.929
There was an altercation
at your sister's wedding.

06:43.997 --> 06:46.665
A promise of a reckoning.

06:46.766 --> 06:49.334
I would beg you to desist from
pursuit of your mother's honour.

06:49.435 --> 06:52.371
You may know little of me,
but those who know me know

06:52.438 --> 06:55.908
that I remember such things.

06:55.975 --> 06:58.544
You are concerned
for your husband's safety?

06:58.611 --> 07:00.379
For yours.

07:00.480 --> 07:05.317
He is a brute, a <i>condotiorre,</i>
<i>the veteran of many battles.</i>

07:05.451 --> 07:08.420
Your calling is the Church,
not the sword.

07:08.488 --> 07:10.622
If you were harmed,

07:10.657 --> 07:14.159
I could not forgive myself.

07:14.260 --> 07:18.096
I could not, perhaps, live.

07:18.164 --> 07:21.833
You care so much
for one you hardly know?

07:23.836 --> 07:26.471
Yes.

07:26.573 --> 07:28.473
It is a puzzle.

07:28.508 --> 07:32.177
Or a mystery.

07:32.278 --> 07:36.748
Your visage is before
my eyes when I'm asleep,

07:36.849 --> 07:39.918
when I wake,

07:39.986 --> 07:43.255
when I close them.

07:43.323 --> 07:46.091
I thought my eyes deceived me.
Now I think, mine ears.

07:46.159 --> 07:48.460
Neither.

07:48.528 --> 07:50.362
Bring your lips close
to mine, Cardinal.

07:50.496 --> 07:52.631
I would feel your breath.

07:54.534 --> 07:56.468
And I would kiss you,

07:56.536 --> 08:00.305
but for this barrier
between us.

08:00.373 --> 08:02.541
God is watching.

08:02.642 --> 08:04.710
As the Bible tells us,

08:04.844 --> 08:07.946
He is a jealous God.

08:10.149 --> 08:13.218
There may always be
a barrier between us.

08:13.286 --> 08:16.288
But if you promise me you will
not put yourself in harm's way,

08:16.389 --> 08:19.891
then my heart's kiss
will be yours.

08:20.026 --> 08:22.661
I promise then.

08:22.729 --> 08:25.998
I will not put myself
in harm's way.

08:26.065 --> 08:29.301
But you asked for deliverance,
Ursula Bonadeo.

08:31.237 --> 08:33.071
The Lord will decide
my fate

08:33.172 --> 08:37.676
and it will be
my fate to accept.

08:37.744 --> 08:40.679
But now I must leave before
my soul flies from these lips.

08:44.550 --> 08:47.586
You loved my father.

08:49.522 --> 08:52.224
Fool that I am, my son,

08:52.325 --> 08:54.693
perhaps I love him still.

08:54.761 --> 08:57.929
Can it be cured?

08:57.997 --> 09:00.098
No.

09:00.233 --> 09:04.036
It can be endured,

09:04.103 --> 09:09.341
embraced and suffered.

09:09.442 --> 09:12.511
You are suffering, my son?

09:15.081 --> 09:17.416
I have met a woman, Mother.

09:23.089 --> 09:25.223
Who is married.

09:25.291 --> 09:28.460
And she makes you suffer.

09:32.699 --> 09:36.034
[Sigh]
Perhaps she suffers too.

09:37.737 --> 09:40.272
She does.

09:42.275 --> 09:45.410
But if I can rid her
of her impediment...

09:45.445 --> 09:48.580
She will be yours?

09:48.681 --> 09:51.683
To endure a life
like you did, Mother.

09:51.784 --> 09:55.120
You could leave the Church.

09:57.857 --> 10:01.693
And displease your father.

10:01.794 --> 10:03.762
If you dare.

10:11.237 --> 10:14.773
I fear nothing, Mother.

10:18.811 --> 10:20.645
[Whinnying]

10:20.780 --> 10:22.647
[Woman in the distance]:
I hope you will enjoy them.

10:22.782 --> 10:26.585
Baronessa.

10:26.652 --> 10:28.887
- Thank you.
- <i>Dio ti Benedica.</i>

10:28.988 --> 10:30.756
- God bless you, my lady.
- Thank you.

10:30.823 --> 10:33.492
Sister, we need your help
in the infirmary.

10:42.568 --> 10:45.871
How did you find me?

10:45.938 --> 10:48.707
I have my spies.

10:48.775 --> 10:50.675
And they told you...

10:50.777 --> 10:53.612
There was a vision,
on a white horse,

10:53.679 --> 10:58.850
that rides out every morning
between <i>prime</i> and <i>terce.</i>

10:58.918 --> 11:02.120
I am observed then.

11:02.188 --> 11:04.122
As are we.

11:04.190 --> 11:08.493
My husband does insist
I am accompanied.

11:08.528 --> 11:11.630
Can they be discreet?

11:11.697 --> 11:13.765
I see no need
for discretion.

11:15.768 --> 11:17.803
No need.

11:19.806 --> 11:21.973
Why do you have
spies, Cardinal?

11:22.041 --> 11:24.543
A cardinal must have spies.

11:24.644 --> 11:28.780
Does it displease you
that I searched you out?

11:28.848 --> 11:32.450
No. Far from it.

11:32.552 --> 11:36.321
There are many things that
please me about you, Cardinal.

11:36.389 --> 11:39.357
Among them, the fact
that you are a cardinal.

11:39.392 --> 11:42.527
Can you explain?

11:48.401 --> 11:51.169
If I can find the words.

11:54.073 --> 11:58.243
Your priestly collar makes me
hope my heart is safe.

12:00.746 --> 12:04.182
Because I am not fully
in command of it.

12:04.250 --> 12:07.085
So the fact that you are
a cardinal pleases me

12:07.153 --> 12:10.255
as it distresses me.

12:10.389 --> 12:13.992
I thought I would not be
cardinal for today.

12:16.329 --> 12:18.096
Then my heart is in danger.

12:18.164 --> 12:20.999
Would you endanger it,
Cardinal Borgia?

12:21.100 --> 12:23.435
I would put it in fear
of its life.

12:23.569 --> 12:25.904
Ah.

12:26.005 --> 12:29.174
But I would never harm it.

12:32.078 --> 12:34.012
That sounds like a riddle.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.615
Are you good at riddles,
Cardinal Borgia?

12:36.682 --> 12:38.950
Sadly, I must live
in one.

12:39.051 --> 12:40.552
As must I.

13:03.476 --> 13:06.912
[Door creaking and closing]

13:12.151 --> 13:14.386
And your name is?

13:14.453 --> 13:18.123
Francesca.

13:23.496 --> 13:26.564
What do you know
of marriage, Francesca?

13:26.632 --> 13:30.735
I know, my lady,

13:30.803 --> 13:33.305
it should not be thus.

13:44.083 --> 13:46.952
It was retrieved from
a confessional in Florence.

13:49.021 --> 13:51.323
And it was not used
for opening letters?

13:51.424 --> 13:53.325
No, Your Eminence.

13:53.426 --> 13:56.661
It was found impaled in the eye
of a mendicant friar.

13:59.799 --> 14:03.368
And who impaled him?

14:03.502 --> 14:06.771
The one we commanded him
to follow.

14:11.043 --> 14:13.378
Can you do nothing right!?

14:16.315 --> 14:19.684
Blink once

14:19.785 --> 14:22.053
and you will be eyeless.

14:22.154 --> 14:27.158
And I would still serve you
without one eye, Your Eminence.

14:27.226 --> 14:29.894
Or without two.

14:31.731 --> 14:35.400
So we lost him
and you know not where?

14:35.534 --> 14:37.802
Milan.

14:39.739 --> 14:42.407
You should wear
a clown's hat.

14:48.247 --> 14:50.982
Della Rovere has left Florence.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.984
With or without satisfaction?

14:53.085 --> 14:55.587
We have the papal armies,
the Sforza armies,

14:55.654 --> 14:58.757
our allies in the Romagna
all under my command.

15:00.659 --> 15:03.528
To hell with Florence!

15:03.596 --> 15:07.165
My fear is the cardinal would
invite apocalypse.

15:08.934 --> 15:13.538
He would open the 7 seals?

15:13.606 --> 15:16.875
No, Father. Let us not talk
in metaphors.

15:16.942 --> 15:19.944
My fear is...

15:20.079 --> 15:22.113
he would go to France,

15:22.214 --> 15:24.883
conspire with the French
to invade us,

15:24.950 --> 15:27.085
arrange free passage
of their armies

15:27.119 --> 15:29.187
through the Republic
of Florence,

15:29.255 --> 15:31.623
through the Duchy
of Milan.

15:31.724 --> 15:34.526
- And the French King would...
- Depose you,

15:34.593 --> 15:38.463
march south to Naples.

15:38.564 --> 15:41.132
His armies are hardened
by a 100 years of battle

15:41.233 --> 15:43.902
with England. There is nothing
here to match them.

15:43.969 --> 15:46.971
Duke Ludovico Sforza
of Milan.

15:47.106 --> 15:49.240
He is cousin
to our sister's husband,

15:49.308 --> 15:51.443
Giovanni Sforza.
[Snicker from Cardinal]

15:51.544 --> 15:55.914
Lucrezia did not marry
Ludovico Sforza, Brother.

15:55.981 --> 15:58.650
And they don't call him
<i>Il Moro</i> for nothing.

16:00.586 --> 16:05.924
I hear he keeps his own cousin
caged beneath his castle floors.

16:05.991 --> 16:08.259
He would betray us
in a moment

16:08.327 --> 16:12.330
if he thought
his dukedom was in peril.

16:12.465 --> 16:14.999
What he fears

16:15.101 --> 16:18.336
is that his nephew will
wear his crown.

16:18.437 --> 16:21.906
Well,

16:22.007 --> 16:24.008
perhaps we should threaten him

16:24.076 --> 16:26.744
with just that possibility.

16:28.981 --> 16:32.484
And you should go to Florence

16:32.585 --> 16:35.353
tease out their intentions.

16:35.421 --> 16:37.922
Those Medici bankers

16:37.990 --> 16:40.758
have a preacher,

16:40.826 --> 16:43.528
Savonarola,

16:43.629 --> 16:46.664
who accuses them of usury.

16:50.870 --> 16:55.106
Perhaps we should offer them
an excommunication...

16:57.209 --> 17:00.211
...public burning

17:00.312 --> 17:04.848
if they support
our just cause.

17:17.762 --> 17:20.265
They call me <i>Il Moro,</i>
<i>Cardinal.</i>

17:20.332 --> 17:23.835
Can you imagine why?

17:23.868 --> 17:27.105
Because of Your Highness'
dark complexion?

17:27.205 --> 17:30.108
Because of my cunning.

17:30.176 --> 17:32.710
Like the Moors of old,

17:32.811 --> 17:35.413
I outwit them all.

17:35.481 --> 17:38.783
You will have given my proposal
the grace of your cunning then?

17:38.851 --> 17:42.754
Hmm...

17:42.821 --> 17:44.989
[Soft laughter]

17:45.124 --> 17:47.225
You...

17:47.293 --> 17:50.094
wish me to grant
French arms

17:50.162 --> 17:52.096
safe passage

17:52.164 --> 17:54.465
through the Duchy of Milan.

17:56.835 --> 17:59.971
But why would the French King
march south, hm?

18:00.005 --> 18:02.607
Because, most honourable duke,

18:02.675 --> 18:05.410
of his claims
on the Kingdom of Naples.

18:05.477 --> 18:10.181
Ah! The great game of Naples.

18:10.282 --> 18:13.785
Everybody wants Naples.

18:13.852 --> 18:15.753
My nephew,

18:15.821 --> 18:18.590
GIAN GALEAZZO,

18:18.691 --> 18:21.759
thinks it part
of his inheritance.

18:21.827 --> 18:25.196
But then...
[Laughter]

18:25.331 --> 18:29.133
He thinks Milan is his. Hm!

18:35.007 --> 18:38.042
AM I RIGHT, NEPHEW?

18:38.143 --> 18:40.945
You think it Christian

18:41.013 --> 18:43.781
to have him so caged?

18:43.882 --> 18:46.351
Until he comes
to his senses.

18:46.452 --> 18:50.521
WHO AM I?

18:50.556 --> 18:53.491
You are Ludovico Sforza.

18:53.559 --> 18:55.727
I am not the Duke of Milan?

18:55.828 --> 18:57.996
That title is mine.

19:00.899 --> 19:03.234
MINE!

19:03.369 --> 19:07.705
Admit it and you'll have
wine to drink.

19:16.682 --> 19:19.684
Politics is a delicate game.

19:21.687 --> 19:23.554
So I observe, my lord.

19:25.391 --> 19:27.392
You, Cardinal?

19:27.459 --> 19:29.861
Have you come to liberate him?

19:29.895 --> 19:31.796
I have come to ask

19:31.897 --> 19:34.065
for the safe passage
of French arms.

19:34.166 --> 19:36.234
Indeed.

19:36.302 --> 19:39.704
From the Duke of Milan.
[Snicker]

19:39.805 --> 19:42.206
Well, Cardinal.

19:42.241 --> 19:44.876
I will consider it.

19:44.977 --> 19:48.146
[Bell ringing]
[Woman in the distance]:
Fresh bread! Bread, bread!

19:48.247 --> 19:51.149
[Man in the distance]:
Cabbages this way! More cabbages
for your money! Over here!

19:51.250 --> 19:53.151
- You got 2 plump ones for me?
- Yes, of course, <i>signore.</i>

19:53.252 --> 19:55.320
- Well fed, are they?
- Fresh bread here!

19:55.421 --> 19:57.522
[Man]: Florence,
the time will come,

19:57.589 --> 19:59.524
when all your finery,

19:59.591 --> 20:03.928
goods, and chattels will
profit you nothing.

20:04.063 --> 20:08.766
You have lived in usury,
Florence, like pigs in heat.

20:08.867 --> 20:13.237
The riches of your banking may
astound the world,

20:13.339 --> 20:18.943
but one day
they will be your undoing!

20:19.078 --> 20:22.680
Owing to your avarice,
neither you

20:22.748 --> 20:25.717
nor your children lead
a good life.

20:25.784 --> 20:28.119
You have already discovered

20:28.220 --> 20:30.888
many devices of gaining money...

20:30.956 --> 20:33.891
It was rumoured a cardinal had
graced Florence with his presence.

20:33.959 --> 20:37.628
...which you call just,
and are most unjust.

20:37.696 --> 20:39.597
- You are?
- Niccolo Machiavelli.

20:39.631 --> 20:41.799
...likewise has...

20:41.900 --> 20:43.801
Ambassador of the
House of Medici.

20:43.902 --> 20:47.605
...corrupted the magistrates
and their functions.

20:47.639 --> 20:51.809
This friar would burn
your Florence to the ground.

20:51.877 --> 20:53.878
Not quite.

20:53.946 --> 20:57.548
Oh, no one can persuade you
it is sinful to lend at usury.

20:57.616 --> 20:59.550
He would reduce us
to his own status.

20:59.618 --> 21:01.319
...and make
unjust bargains...

21:01.420 --> 21:03.321
- Which is?
- ...on the contrary...

21:03.422 --> 21:06.157
A pile of straw
on a monastery floor.

21:06.291 --> 21:08.726
- ...you defend yourselves.
- He disapproves...

21:08.794 --> 21:10.728
...to your souls' damnation!

21:10.796 --> 21:14.799
...of display,
ornament, artistry.

21:14.833 --> 21:16.768
- Nor does any man...
- Even comfort.

21:16.802 --> 21:18.703
...take shame to himself...

21:18.771 --> 21:23.207
Perhaps Cardinal Cesare Borgia
can be of some help.

21:23.275 --> 21:27.078
He would meet with my master,
Piero de Medici?

21:27.146 --> 21:29.647
- ...fools who refrain from it.
- No.

21:29.748 --> 21:31.649
He would meet with you,
Ambassador.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.786
Thus, thy fulfilled
the saying of Isaiah-

21:34.820 --> 21:37.422
Aha, a conspiracy then.

21:37.489 --> 21:39.223
"They declare their sin
as Sodom"

21:39.291 --> 21:44.228
No.
More like an inquisition.

21:44.296 --> 21:47.165
...and of Jeremiah,
"Thou hast a whore's forehead."

21:47.232 --> 21:50.768
Perhaps you should
follow me.

21:50.836 --> 21:54.005
"...thou refusedst
to be ashamed."

21:54.106 --> 21:56.007
Another cardinal came
through here

21:56.108 --> 21:58.676
some days ago.

21:58.744 --> 22:03.281
He left his mark, I believe,
on a confessional door.

22:03.348 --> 22:07.084
There was
a friar found murdered.

22:07.152 --> 22:10.354
But that cardinal claimed
to be a man of peace.

22:10.422 --> 22:13.691
We all do,
<i>Signor</i> Machiavelli.

22:13.792 --> 22:16.360
You make the same claims?

22:16.462 --> 22:19.163
For the moment.

22:19.198 --> 22:21.165
But I would hazard,

22:21.200 --> 22:22.967
if this cardinal passed
through Florence,

22:23.035 --> 22:25.473
he did more than pinion
a mendicant friar to

22:25.474 --> 22:26.600
a confessional door.

22:26.605 --> 22:29.707
- You would?
- Yes, I would hazard he met

22:29.775 --> 22:33.611
with the Florentine ambassador
and his master, de Medici.

22:33.679 --> 22:36.714
And <i>if</i> he did?

22:36.849 --> 22:39.817
I would hazard there was
a purpose to that meeting.

22:39.885 --> 22:42.286
The purpose being?

22:42.387 --> 22:45.523
That Florence unite
with his cause.

22:45.557 --> 22:50.194
No. On the contrary.
He asked for nothing.

22:50.229 --> 22:53.064
Nothing?

22:53.131 --> 22:55.066
Or, to be more specific,

22:55.133 --> 22:57.068
he asked
that Florence...

22:57.135 --> 23:01.172
do...
nothing.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.241
He requested
that Florence do nothing,

23:03.375 --> 23:07.545
in the event
of a great something.

23:11.250 --> 23:13.551
You are far too clever
for a cardinal.

23:13.652 --> 23:15.553
The times have
made me so.

23:15.654 --> 23:19.657
He requested
that Florence do nothing,

23:19.725 --> 23:23.427
and allow a great passage
of arms through its republic.

23:25.497 --> 23:27.832
Perhaps.

23:27.900 --> 23:30.434
And Florence promised him?

23:32.404 --> 23:35.740
Why should I tell you
what Florence told him?

23:38.710 --> 23:40.444
I could perhaps ensure

23:40.579 --> 23:43.381
that instead
of your beautiful Florence,

23:43.448 --> 23:47.451
Friar Savonarola
himself burns.

23:47.586 --> 23:50.855
Hmph!

23:50.923 --> 23:54.392
An impressive offer.

23:54.459 --> 23:58.863
So, Florence offered
the good cardinal?

23:58.964 --> 24:01.599
What he offered Florence.

24:01.633 --> 24:04.802
Nothing.

24:08.073 --> 24:11.642
So the arms of France cannot
pass through your fair republic?

24:11.777 --> 24:15.146
In a sentence.

24:15.213 --> 24:17.048
And if these times have made
you clever,

24:17.149 --> 24:22.320
the coming months may thrust
genius upon you.

24:45.143 --> 24:47.178
My lord is...

24:49.481 --> 24:51.415
My lady.

24:51.483 --> 24:53.317
Forgive me
for startling you.

24:53.418 --> 24:56.687
My lord is hunting.

24:56.788 --> 24:58.689
Would my lady have me saddle
her a horse so she can

24:58.790 --> 24:59.928
ride out after him?

24:59.945 --> 25:02.245
There is nothing your
lady would like less.

25:07.265 --> 25:11.502
He is a good huntsman,
your lord?

25:11.536 --> 25:14.305
No deer is safe from him.

25:14.373 --> 25:17.441
Pity the poor deer then.

25:17.509 --> 25:20.211
But at least
their agony ends.

25:20.312 --> 25:25.316
Yes. He's a clean killer.

25:25.384 --> 25:28.219
And your name is?

25:28.320 --> 25:30.454
Paolo.

25:33.725 --> 25:35.726
Your shirt is torn, Paolo.

25:37.729 --> 25:39.964
Would you like me
to stitch it?

25:40.032 --> 25:41.966
I could never ask, my lady.

25:42.034 --> 25:46.003
And stop this "my lady"
nonsense.

25:46.071 --> 25:49.073
My name is Lucrezia.

25:51.009 --> 25:53.411
Say it.

25:53.545 --> 25:56.914
Lucrezia...
my lady.

25:57.015 --> 25:59.550
...in summation,
Your Holiness,

25:59.584 --> 26:01.552
I would reiterate

26:01.586 --> 26:04.255
his Highness' pleasure
at the possibility

26:04.322 --> 26:07.324
of an union between
the Kingdom of Navarre

26:07.392 --> 26:09.427
and the Borgia family.

26:09.494 --> 26:12.897
Between the <i>Gonfaloniere</i>
<i>Juan Borgia</i>

26:12.998 --> 26:18.335
and his beloved niece,
the Princess Sylvia,

26:18.403 --> 26:20.371
whose portrait is
now my pleasure

26:20.439 --> 26:24.275
to present
to the Papal Court.

26:29.781 --> 26:31.782
We thank his Royal Highness.

26:31.883 --> 26:35.619
And if this depiction
does justice

26:35.687 --> 26:37.621
to the Princess Sylvia,

26:37.723 --> 26:40.191
then her beauty

26:40.292 --> 26:44.361
is indeed without compare.

26:47.899 --> 26:52.203
Her reputation...
does precede her.

26:54.306 --> 26:57.908
We will consider
your gracious suit

26:57.976 --> 27:00.478
in the fullness of time.

27:12.424 --> 27:16.160
And do the horses
have names, Paolo?

27:16.294 --> 27:18.896
Indeed they do, my lady.

27:18.964 --> 27:22.133
- Lucrezia.
- My lady Lucrezia.

27:24.503 --> 27:26.637
This is Diablo.

27:26.671 --> 27:28.506
The devil.

27:28.607 --> 27:30.474
Yes.

27:30.509 --> 27:32.476
He was the devil for speed
until he tumbled on a break

27:32.511 --> 27:36.113
and shattered his hoof.
And now?

27:36.181 --> 27:39.183
His fire is gone entirely.

27:39.251 --> 27:42.319
He will end up pulling hay.

27:42.420 --> 27:45.956
There are worse
fates, Paolo.

27:49.327 --> 27:52.496
And this one?

27:52.597 --> 27:56.300
An Arab mare...
Fatima.

27:56.368 --> 27:58.275
One could not have
them in the same stable

27:58.300 --> 27:59.403
when he was in his prime.

27:59.404 --> 28:02.673
But after his break...
He was chastened.

28:02.774 --> 28:05.910
He is like a mare
himself now, my lady.

28:07.946 --> 28:10.347
Lucky Fatima.

28:10.482 --> 28:13.017
She can sleep
well at night.

28:17.589 --> 28:20.524
Show me your hands, Paolo.

28:20.625 --> 28:23.127
Bring them here.

28:23.195 --> 28:25.663
I would touch them.

28:27.766 --> 28:29.767
Soft.

28:31.703 --> 28:34.839
Will they be hard some day?

28:34.873 --> 28:37.208
I know not, my lady.

28:37.275 --> 28:39.476
Lucrezia.

28:42.380 --> 28:46.717
♪ I took a bow
and aimed it low ♪

28:46.818 --> 28:48.819
You know it?

28:48.887 --> 28:53.324
[Together]: ♪ And caught you
on the chin, chin, chin ♪

28:53.391 --> 28:56.560
♪ My mother said
Now go to bed ♪

28:56.695 --> 29:01.065
♪ I'll have
to lock you in, in, in ♪

29:11.309 --> 29:14.678
My lady

29:14.746 --> 29:17.314
Lucrezia.

29:17.382 --> 29:20.084
Say it.

29:22.220 --> 29:24.555
Lucrezia.

29:30.362 --> 29:32.930
She is ugly, Father.

29:32.998 --> 29:34.832
No more than all the others.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.667
They are all ugly.

29:39.604 --> 29:41.605
I'll marry none of them.

29:41.706 --> 29:43.234
Second-rate royalty,

29:43.909 --> 29:46.801
cousins of half-brothers
of princes.

29:49.180 --> 29:53.284
I'll marry a king's daughter
or nothing.

29:53.385 --> 29:57.955
Nothing, I'm afraid,
is not an option, my dear son.

29:58.023 --> 30:00.858
Let Joffre marry instead.
King Ferrante of Naples

30:00.926 --> 30:02.960
has an illegitimate daughter.

30:06.431 --> 30:10.534
- Sancia.
- And the pope does need some

30:10.635 --> 30:12.970
security in Naples.

30:14.906 --> 30:19.877
A union between you and Sancia

30:19.978 --> 30:22.713
could have some benefits.

30:22.814 --> 30:24.615
Are you deaf, father?

30:24.716 --> 30:27.151
She is the half-bred bastard
of an ailing dotard.

30:27.252 --> 30:31.221
Let Joffre marry her.
I will marry a true princess

30:31.289 --> 30:33.958
or I will take my pleasures
where I find them.

30:36.995 --> 30:39.330
[Laughter]

30:39.431 --> 30:41.799
Your Holiness--

30:41.833 --> 30:44.435
Forgive me, Cardinal,

30:44.502 --> 30:47.838
I had hoped to find you alone.

30:47.939 --> 30:50.908
And, Your Holiness,
my cousin was just, huh...

30:51.009 --> 30:53.177
- Your cousin?
- Gabriella Visconti,

30:53.244 --> 30:54.912
at your service.

30:54.980 --> 30:58.182
A Sforza?

30:58.249 --> 30:59.408
Twice removed.

30:59.433 --> 31:01.300
Well, we would hope
more than twice.

31:03.922 --> 31:08.158
Well, Cardinal,
you are awash with cousins,

31:08.193 --> 31:11.261
which is why we wish
to speak with you.

31:11.329 --> 31:14.531
At Your Holiness' pleasure.

31:19.804 --> 31:22.206
We would discuss
another cousin,

31:25.010 --> 31:29.113
in whose hands the survival
of our papacy may lie.

31:29.180 --> 31:31.882
Your Holiness refers
to the Duke of Milan?

31:31.950 --> 31:37.121
Indeed. Cardinal Della Rovere
heads there as we speak.

31:37.222 --> 31:39.456
Well, if I can be
of any assistance...

31:39.557 --> 31:43.027
Well, you could disembowel
the dear cardinal.

31:43.128 --> 31:47.297
Does the office of
vice-chancellor extend so far?

31:47.399 --> 31:52.069
To include executions?
Sadly not.

31:52.170 --> 31:55.205
But you could inform
your cousin, the Duke of Milan,

31:55.240 --> 31:57.307
that we could well see

31:57.375 --> 32:00.044
the justice
of his nephew's cause,

32:00.178 --> 32:02.513
should the duke choose

32:02.547 --> 32:06.183
to act against our wishes.

32:15.960 --> 32:18.362
Is your betrothed old,
Francesca?

32:18.396 --> 32:21.632
Nine months older
than me, my lady.

32:21.733 --> 32:24.735
You are lucky then.

32:24.803 --> 32:28.405
The older male is like a boar.

32:28.540 --> 32:31.008
He bristles with hair.

32:31.076 --> 32:34.244
And when he doesn't beat,

32:34.312 --> 32:37.815
he thrusts.

32:37.882 --> 32:39.917
Did he beat last night?

32:39.984 --> 32:43.554
No, but he thrusted.

32:45.523 --> 32:47.991
I counted 27 of them.

32:48.059 --> 32:50.160
32 the night before.

32:50.228 --> 32:52.396
Already, more bearable.

32:52.530 --> 32:55.632
You must quicken his pleasure.

32:55.733 --> 32:57.501
Is that possible?

32:57.569 --> 33:01.238
Indeed. You can reduce it
to single figures.

33:01.339 --> 33:05.042
And for the sake
of one's own endurance,

33:05.076 --> 33:06.810
I find it helps to count.

33:06.911 --> 33:08.912
To count?

33:09.013 --> 33:11.348
Sheep.

33:13.384 --> 33:16.420
[Laughter]

33:18.323 --> 33:20.891
Sancia of Naples.

33:20.925 --> 33:24.428
- What of her?
- Is she beautiful?

33:24.529 --> 33:26.530
In the Neapolitan way.

33:26.598 --> 33:29.366
Ooh, what way is that,
my love?

33:29.434 --> 33:31.902
Dark.

33:31.936 --> 33:35.606
Sicilian.
Almost Moorish.

33:35.740 --> 33:39.376
And I have heard
her temper is Sicilian too.

33:39.444 --> 33:42.946
Would she make a bride for-

33:43.047 --> 33:45.549
Juan?

33:45.617 --> 33:49.853
A match made in...

33:49.921 --> 33:51.763
Where?

33:51.788 --> 33:53.401
Wherever such matches are made.

33:57.428 --> 33:59.429
No, not Juan.

33:59.497 --> 34:02.499
Juan will do what Juan will do.

34:02.567 --> 34:04.868
Cesare? Now that would be--

34:04.936 --> 34:07.771
No, you know Cesare can
never marry.

34:07.872 --> 34:11.074
No, for...

34:11.176 --> 34:13.677
for Joffre.

34:13.745 --> 34:16.246
Good God.

34:24.054 --> 34:27.257
Will you never stop?

34:30.128 --> 34:31.795
Never.

34:31.896 --> 34:36.533
You are going to ensnare
the whole of Europe

34:36.634 --> 34:38.969
in your progeny.

34:40.304 --> 34:44.875
What else are families
for, hm?

34:52.150 --> 34:56.085
Ah! 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

34:56.154 --> 34:58.155
What?
What are you saying?

34:58.256 --> 34:59.823
I am counting, my lord.

34:59.891 --> 35:02.893
- Counting?
- Sheep, my lord.

35:02.994 --> 35:05.629
Could you count in silence?

35:22.447 --> 35:26.250
Counting sheep.

35:26.317 --> 35:28.919
Can she sleep now?

35:29.020 --> 35:32.189
I truly hope so.

35:50.508 --> 35:54.011
You disappoint me, Cardinal.

35:57.615 --> 36:00.517
We are family, after all.

36:00.585 --> 36:04.021
If I am your cousin, my liege,

36:04.122 --> 36:06.690
I am also cousin
to your cousin, Gian Galeazzo,

36:06.824 --> 36:09.693
who lays claim
to your throne.

36:09.794 --> 36:12.162
This Borgia pope threatens--

36:12.196 --> 36:14.598
No, His Holiness does
not threaten.

36:14.666 --> 36:16.600
His Holiness merely reminds
the duke

36:16.668 --> 36:19.703
of where his best interests lie.

36:19.804 --> 36:21.705
And in the event
of a French invasion--

36:21.806 --> 36:24.174
He would pretend
to see the justice

36:24.208 --> 36:26.543
of this pretender's cause--

36:26.644 --> 36:28.278
As we would hope
that you would see--

36:28.379 --> 36:32.215
[Growl]

36:32.317 --> 36:35.786
AH! A CHAMPION! AT LAST,
YOU SNIVELING PRETENDER,

36:35.853 --> 36:39.156
YOU HAVE A CHAMPION!

36:39.223 --> 36:43.560
You would release him, Cardinal?

36:43.661 --> 36:45.896
My lord, I would not be
so precipitous--

36:46.030 --> 36:50.200
No, but I insist!
Release him!

36:50.234 --> 36:53.236
Have him dine with us tonight!

36:53.338 --> 36:56.373
What is it you hunger
for most!?

36:58.042 --> 37:00.744
Freedom.
And pheasant.

37:00.812 --> 37:06.917
So, Cardinal. Let us feed
that hunger of his, hmm?

37:07.018 --> 37:09.019
[Short kiss on head]

37:12.523 --> 37:16.426
Freedom and
pheasant it is.

37:24.369 --> 37:28.438
He wolfs his pheasant so.

37:28.573 --> 37:32.209
Mother never taught him manners.

37:32.276 --> 37:34.211
Another.

37:34.278 --> 37:36.546
Indeed.

37:36.614 --> 37:39.282
You are the Duke now,
are you not?

37:39.350 --> 37:41.718
Have mine.

37:47.759 --> 37:52.095
And you,
cousin cardinal,

37:52.196 --> 37:54.431
can tell that Borgia pope,

37:54.565 --> 37:56.433
that Catalan clown,

37:56.567 --> 37:59.336
that Spanish nonentity

37:59.404 --> 38:00.904
that marries
his bastard daughter

38:00.938 --> 38:04.775
to my cousin and thinks
he will buy my friendship!

38:04.909 --> 38:06.777
Tell him he will never have it!

38:06.878 --> 38:09.079
Tell him I will welcome

38:09.113 --> 38:12.249
French arms with open arms
of my own!

38:12.283 --> 38:15.018
Spit it out!

38:15.086 --> 38:17.921
Poison!

38:17.955 --> 38:19.790
Gluttony, more like.

38:19.924 --> 38:21.725
[Snickering]

38:24.395 --> 38:27.564
Duke for an hour.

38:27.632 --> 38:30.634
Undone by his table manners.

38:30.768 --> 38:32.803
[Snickering]

38:47.552 --> 38:49.453
You have no servants?

38:49.487 --> 38:51.288
Thank you, my lady.

38:51.389 --> 38:53.490
Some tasks one must
perform oneself.

38:53.591 --> 38:57.127
- Such as?
- Distribution of alms.

38:57.228 --> 39:00.564
In the convent of St. Cecilia,
there are many hungry souls.

39:00.631 --> 39:03.733
I stand in awe,
Ursula Bonadeo.

39:03.801 --> 39:06.470
Of what?
Of loaves of bread?

39:06.571 --> 39:09.906
Of goodness.

39:09.974 --> 39:13.310
- Would that I were good.
- Don't move so quickly.

39:13.411 --> 39:16.313
What is that mark
under that veil?

39:16.347 --> 39:18.648
I beg you, heed it not.
It is in his nature.

39:18.683 --> 39:20.484
So it seems.

39:20.518 --> 39:22.752
And it is not in yours.
So heed it not.

39:22.854 --> 39:26.490
Forget him and forget me.

39:35.933 --> 39:38.468
You cannot stand for this.

39:38.536 --> 39:40.370
The groom saw.
The groom talked.

39:40.505 --> 39:43.373
My husband struck.
It's what husbands do.

39:45.309 --> 39:47.844
You must free yourself.

39:58.055 --> 40:00.023
He rides to Ostia
tomorrow night.

40:00.057 --> 40:02.492
For 2 days,
I will be free.

40:20.912 --> 40:24.080
You requested these,
Your Eminence.

40:24.181 --> 40:26.249
Yes.

40:28.252 --> 40:31.688
Since I have become eminent,
I have grown indolent.

40:31.756 --> 40:34.591
I believe one goes
with the other, Your Eminence.

40:34.692 --> 40:37.894
Call me Borgia
this good morning.

40:37.995 --> 40:39.896
And I shall call you baron.

40:39.997 --> 40:42.933
Baron?

40:43.034 --> 40:44.935
Yes.

40:45.036 --> 40:48.271
I made a promise
to a favoured lady

40:48.372 --> 40:51.508
that I would not put myself
in harm's way. So...

40:55.379 --> 40:57.781
...put me in harm's way.

41:05.256 --> 41:07.624
Come on, Baron,
I would see your best.

41:07.725 --> 41:10.794
[Clashing swords]

41:14.799 --> 41:16.800
Now, my best

41:16.867 --> 41:19.436
would break
your promise, Borgia.

41:24.942 --> 41:27.243
Show me then.

41:27.311 --> 41:32.148
[Grunts and clashing swords]

41:55.773 --> 41:58.441
One blade is never enough,
Your Eminence.

41:58.509 --> 42:01.645
Yes.

42:01.679 --> 42:05.849
And eminence has dulled
my edge.

42:10.121 --> 42:12.188
Again.

42:14.959 --> 42:17.827
Where does he hunt?

42:17.862 --> 42:22.365
In the high mountain passes.

42:22.466 --> 42:26.302
He is brave with those deer.

42:28.973 --> 42:31.107
Perhaps.

42:31.208 --> 42:35.011
But they suffer
less than me, do they not?

42:35.112 --> 42:37.380
He kills them quickly.

42:37.481 --> 42:40.283
Do you suffer?

42:40.351 --> 42:42.952
- Nightly.
- It must stop.

42:43.020 --> 42:45.555
It is a crime against...

42:45.656 --> 42:48.024
Against what?

42:49.694 --> 42:51.828
Against you.

42:51.896 --> 42:55.198
Your beauty.

42:55.232 --> 42:58.968
You are the pope's daughter.
How can he stand it?

42:59.036 --> 43:02.706
The pope doesn't know.

43:04.675 --> 43:06.710
If I could write,
I would send him a letter.

43:09.847 --> 43:13.450
Am I beautiful, Paolo?

43:15.720 --> 43:18.188
You are the most beautiful
thing I have yet seen.

43:20.958 --> 43:23.393
Lift me down.

43:32.570 --> 43:35.371
I could adjust his saddle.

43:35.406 --> 43:40.076
You could adjust
my lord's saddle

43:40.144 --> 43:42.245
He would fall.

43:42.379 --> 43:46.583
He would break.

43:46.650 --> 43:49.185
He would return home,

43:49.253 --> 43:51.755
tamed.

43:51.822 --> 43:54.591
Broken.

43:56.327 --> 43:59.863
- What if he died?
- From a fall? He would never.

44:01.832 --> 44:04.934
What if I had you whipped
for wickedness?

44:05.035 --> 44:06.936
You would never.

44:07.037 --> 44:11.107
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

44:11.242 --> 44:13.843
Of that I am sure.

44:13.911 --> 44:17.447
The cardinal was shocked
to the core.

44:17.581 --> 44:21.117
Apparently, he dropped dead
right in front of him

44:21.218 --> 44:23.219
at the duke's table.

44:23.287 --> 44:26.122
Poison.

44:26.190 --> 44:29.025
So it is rumoured.

44:29.093 --> 44:33.029
Gluttony, it is said.

44:33.130 --> 44:35.298
But the result's the same.

44:37.401 --> 44:39.235
If the French army moves,

44:39.303 --> 44:43.139
it will have free passage
through Milan.

44:43.207 --> 44:46.309
And the only force to stop it
will be Florence.

44:48.979 --> 44:51.781
And Florence can
hardly stand alone.

44:55.920 --> 45:00.290
No, I think it might be time
to give Naples what they want.

45:00.324 --> 45:02.992
An alliance?

45:03.093 --> 45:06.062
Better than that.

45:06.163 --> 45:08.598
A wedding!

45:10.568 --> 45:13.136
Who this time, Father? Me?

45:17.274 --> 45:20.510
Ah! Five... Six...

45:20.578 --> 45:23.346
[Whimpers]

45:23.414 --> 45:25.515
Seven...
[Grunts]

45:25.616 --> 45:28.351
Eight...
[Restrained sob]

45:28.452 --> 45:32.689
Nine...
[Grunts]

45:32.756 --> 45:36.125
Eleven...
[Whimpers]

45:36.193 --> 45:38.328
Twelve.
[Whimpers and grunts]

46:37.922 --> 46:40.089
My wife is to receive
no visitors

46:40.157 --> 46:43.359
in my absence.
Yes, my lord.

46:52.903 --> 46:55.004
You should let me deal with
him, Your Eminence.

46:57.007 --> 46:59.909
Did he insult
your mother?

46:59.944 --> 47:02.211
Then we should
both do it.

47:04.214 --> 47:07.750
Where would the valour
be in that?

47:10.788 --> 47:14.290
Or the pleasure?

47:14.391 --> 47:17.260
No.

47:17.294 --> 47:20.763
I shall do this...

47:20.864 --> 47:23.099
alone.

47:34.979 --> 47:37.280
An accident, my lady.

47:37.314 --> 47:39.315
The Lord Sforza.

47:39.416 --> 47:42.552
[Cat purring]

47:56.767 --> 48:00.770
You, Cardinal, have been
nosing round my wife.

48:00.838 --> 48:04.507
And you, Baron,
slandered my mother.

48:04.608 --> 48:07.110
You mean the Spanish whore?

48:09.580 --> 48:11.781
I mean my mother.

48:11.849 --> 48:15.651
From the whorehouse to the
Vatican is quite a journey.

48:15.686 --> 48:18.588
But it ends here.

48:20.591 --> 48:23.326
[Whinnying]
- Ah!
- Oh!

48:34.805 --> 48:37.040
[Clanging swords]

48:42.179 --> 48:47.316
[Cry of agony]

48:53.724 --> 48:57.126
Your wife prayed
for liberation.

48:57.194 --> 49:01.064
<i>Libera me domine</i>
<i>de morte aeterna.</i>

49:11.141 --> 49:13.876
You never forget
your first.

49:13.977 --> 49:17.580
Lift!
I felt the life go from him.

49:17.648 --> 49:20.683
Better him than you. But at
least you are still breathing.

49:27.124 --> 49:29.826
Was I in harm's way,
Micheletto?

49:29.893 --> 49:33.229
Not for a moment,
Your Eminence.

49:40.804 --> 49:43.906
- Leave me alone!
- It is a break, my lord,

49:43.907 --> 49:45.875
but you will survive it.
Water, please.

49:45.909 --> 49:47.584
A muslin cloth
and a splint,

49:47.609 --> 49:49.126
a piece of wood
between his teeth.

49:49.980 --> 49:52.148
My husband!

49:52.249 --> 49:54.317
Forgive me, my lord.

49:54.384 --> 49:57.320
You will feel some pain.
Be brave, my husband.

49:57.421 --> 49:59.388
On the count of 3.

49:59.423 --> 50:02.925
1, 2,

50:02.950 --> 50:04.150
3.

50:04.718 --> 50:09.220
[Crack!]
[Scream of pain]

50:12.703 --> 50:14.937
You killed this man
with grace, Your Eminence.

50:15.038 --> 50:17.240
You should be proud.

50:19.209 --> 50:22.879
- Will I be thanked for it?
- In my experience,

50:22.946 --> 50:25.681
one rarely is.

50:25.749 --> 50:28.518
A thankless task then.

50:28.585 --> 50:32.421
The river will be grateful
for him, Your Eminence.

50:32.523 --> 50:35.625
It loves a skewered corpse.
