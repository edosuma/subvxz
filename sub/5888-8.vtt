BARBIE: A few weeks ago, an invisible
dome crashed down on Chester's Mill,

from the rest of the world.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.936
Isn't being sheriff a little low
on the totem pole for you?

13:35.106 --> 13:40.351
Look, protection of this town
has always been my first priority.

13:40.528 --> 13:43.270
Now that Barbie's gone,
someone has to wear the star.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.397
Just, uh...

13:46.242 --> 13:48.949
- ...hope I can live up to it.
- Still a politician at heart.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.735
No, I'm not.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.164
Things are different.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.531
The dome has revealed
it has plans for me.

13:55.710 --> 13:58.167
So now you think
the dome speaks to people.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.913
I'm sorry I didn't believe you
when you said it, son.

14:02.091 --> 14:05.925
Look, if I'd understood,
you know, everything,

14:06.471 --> 14:09.804
- maybe I could've protected Angie.
- Don't use her to sell me on this.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.680
Look, l'mjust saying
I have made mistakes.

14:11.851 --> 14:15.264
I should've put my trust
in family, first and foremost.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.144
I should've trusted you, son.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.140
REBECCA [OVER RADIO]:
Big Jim, you there?

14:20.485 --> 14:22.521
- Yeah, Rebecca. What?
- Not sure exactly,

14:22.695 --> 14:24.196
but we got a problem
at the Sweetbriar.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.531
- Police need to see this.
- Okay, be right there.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.650
Why don't you hold down the fort?

14:31.162 --> 14:32.698
I'll go check this out.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.575
Why don't I come with you?

14:34.749 --> 14:36.831
Show the department's
new employee the ropes.

14:38.961 --> 14:39.996
After you.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.675
What can we do for you?

14:49.472 --> 14:50.882
What's going on, Rebecca?

14:51.057 --> 14:54.345
I went to check on the windmill
and someone had cut it down.

14:54.519 --> 14:58.432
I kept searching for it,
and found it here.

15:00.358 --> 15:01.848
Who the hell
would destroy this thing?

15:02.026 --> 15:06.269
Especially after it saved us all
from choking to death a few days ago.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.780
Someone's trying
to send me a message.

15:09.951 --> 15:13.489
- Not everything's about you, Dad.
- Well, it's gotta mean something.

15:13.663 --> 15:16.325
WOMAN: Hello, police?
- Yeah, it's Junior. What's going on?

15:16.499 --> 15:18.364
WOMAN: There's a ﬁre
at Map/e and Thornton.

15:18.543 --> 15:19.908
- We need help.
- Be there in a sec.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.166
You in, Barbie?

15:28.344 --> 15:29.379
Yeah, I'm in.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.886
Hey, if this is a setup,
you're gonna have a hell of a time

15:32.056 --> 15:33.671
picking up your teeth
with broken fingers.

15:33.850 --> 15:37.513
I get it, you're tough. Just get to his
computer and put in the jump drive.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.308
It's password protected.

15:41.482 --> 15:42.858
Put in thejump drive.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.238
House security makes their rounds
every two minutes.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.273
How long is this gonna take?

15:54.412 --> 15:55.868
About that long.

15:56.038 --> 16:00.202
- I take it you're not in gardening.
- I'm in computing, but don't worry.

16:00.376 --> 16:04.369
I fight the good fight. Now open a
browser and go to houndsofdiana.com.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.381
I've been seeing that graffiti
around town.

16:09.552 --> 16:13.340
It's my website to tell the world
it's being lied to about the dome.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.050
Okay, I'm there.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.181
Can you see that box up top?

16:18.352 --> 16:22.095
- Type in the code "dromas. "
- Dromas.

16:26.152 --> 16:29.895
- Uh, I might've screwed something up.
- Nope.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.772
Go ahead and take the jump out,
and I'll take it from here.

16:41.209 --> 16:44.042
Here's the real e-mail
your father sent her.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.002
So "Julia, I love you.
We'll see each other soon.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.959
All it takes is a leap of faith.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.381
So get the egg

16:52.303 --> 16:54.419
and bring it with you."

16:55.389 --> 16:57.004
Oh, my God, he did change it.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.298
Now do you believe me?

16:58.476 --> 16:59.966
What does my dad
want with the egg?

17:00.144 --> 17:03.386
- Yeah, what is that thing?
- I can't let Julia jump.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.977
What are you doing?

17:07.527 --> 17:11.190
- Not every day I get a backstage pass.
- No. I've got everything that I needed.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.982
- Yeah. Relax, Barbie.
- We're done. Get out of there.

17:18.871 --> 17:19.951
What the hell?

17:20.122 --> 17:22.784
DON: I could ask you the same thing.
- Hey, Dad.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.241
Stall him.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.833
Son, what're you doing in here?

17:30.007 --> 17:31.998
Nothing. I wasjust
trying to check my e-mail.

17:32.176 --> 17:35.009
See if Julia replied,
but I couldn't log in.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.555
Well, she wouldn't have replied.

17:36.722 --> 17:40.135
Yeah, no, I know,
it's a military firewall,

17:40.309 --> 17:42.391
but I was just hoping
there's a chance.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.427
Oh, look at this.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.438
This photo. I love this photo of Mom.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.229
Where was this taken?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.019
The lake house.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.188
- On our anniversary.
- Right.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.527
Come on, come on.

18:04.959 --> 18:09.168
Yeah, see?
Like I said, wouldn't let me log in.

18:10.298 --> 18:12.914
I just wish there was a way
to get her another message.

18:14.635 --> 18:15.670
Dale,

18:17.430 --> 18:19.136
I need you to come with me.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.403
ANDREA: I was stepping out
to get some supplies for the diner

18:40.578 --> 18:42.409
and spotted the car wild with fire.

18:42.580 --> 18:43.911
Thank God you gave me this walkie.

18:44.081 --> 18:47.198
Yeah, you did a good job, Andrea.
Thanks. We'll take it from here.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.163
People in this town are losing it.

18:49.837 --> 18:53.876
- Or someone's on a vandalism spree.
- You're still not seeing the pattern?

18:54.050 --> 18:55.756
First they hit the windmill
that I put up,

18:55.926 --> 18:59.339
now under a sign for my dealership,
they torch a car.

19:00.723 --> 19:01.758
A car that I sold.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.014
You've sold two-thirds
of the cars in town.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.300
It's not a coincidence, son.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.343
REBECCA: Technically,
two events are a coincidence.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.772
Takes three to make a pattern.

19:08.939 --> 19:11.772
Well, I'm not gonna wait
till that's my head on a platter.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.309
It's the only lead we got. Follow it.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.234
Haven't been here in a while.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.900
The company's grown a lot.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.949
I haven't been entirely
truthful with you.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.162
About?

19:31.337 --> 19:32.827
The message you had me
send to Julia?

19:33.005 --> 19:35.621
It went to her,
but not through the military.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.916
It came from here?

19:38.219 --> 19:40.756
Aktaion Energy has other divisions.

19:40.930 --> 19:43.171
Satellite imaging,
telecommunications.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.806
You're a government contractor.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.886
After the dome came down,

19:50.147 --> 19:52.263
we were hired
to monitor radiation levels.

19:52.441 --> 19:56.605
But we were the first to discover a way
to get a Wi-Fi signal into the dome.

19:56.779 --> 19:59.691
Which you then shared
with your friends in the military.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.150
For a healthy profit.

20:01.325 --> 20:04.738
But we kept a back door
as a way to be able to use it ourselves.

20:04.912 --> 20:05.947
That can't be legal.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.704
No, which is why it was a huge risk
for us to send that message.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.078
And the one we're about to send.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.336
Oh, he's not here.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.047
Yes, I am, sir.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.554
Oh, Hunter May,
meet my son, Dale.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.432
How are you? Nice to meet you.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.467
Ahem. Yeah, likewise.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.011
DON:
We need you to work your magic.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.690
Send one more message
into the dome.

20:33.858 --> 20:34.973
Dale will dictate it to you.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.189
All right.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.233
Well, fire when ready.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.089
What did you decide to ask him?

21:00.259 --> 21:01.920
If he remembers who he caught

21:02.094 --> 21:04.551
going through his stuff
at home a few days ago.

21:04.722 --> 21:05.882
That was me.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.047
And only the three of us
know about it.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.972
Okay.

21:12.146 --> 21:14.762
- Wrap your note around this.
- What is this?

21:14.940 --> 21:17.272
JOE: A paperweight Big Jim
used to give out with every car.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.934
My dad hated it almost as much
as the lemon Jim sold him.

21:20.321 --> 21:23.063
It'll take your note straight through
whatever the hell is down there

21:23.240 --> 21:26.653
and it'll also prove to Barbie
that it's actually from Chester's Mill.

21:27.578 --> 21:29.660
All right, next stop,

21:30.915 --> 21:32.371
Barbie.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.156
Hopefully.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.009
Wait, wait. The signal's back.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.635
Barbie sent you another e-mail.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.518
"Julia, hang in there.

21:51.685 --> 21:54.813
Whenever you get scared,
just remember the first time we kissed.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.063
At the dome
by Joe's house at sunset.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.314
The stars coming out.

21:59.485 --> 22:02.192
I can't wait to hold you there again.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.859
Love, Your Stray."

22:07.701 --> 22:08.907
He's alive.

22:10.538 --> 22:12.074
Quick, let's write something back.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.743
- The signal's lost.
JULIA: It doesn't matter.

22:16.210 --> 22:18.201
- He's alive.
- So you're gonna jump?

22:18.379 --> 22:19.664
No, he doesn't want me to.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.421
- He wants to meet face to face.
- How do you know that?

22:22.591 --> 22:24.707
He proved it was him
by signing it, "Your Stray."

22:25.135 --> 22:26.511
I called him that once.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.294
The thing about the first kiss,

22:28.472 --> 22:31.839
wrong place, wrong time,
wrong weather.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.394
"At the dome by Joe's house.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.598
At sunset. Stars coming out."

22:36.772 --> 22:40.435
It was actually in the middle of town
late at night in the pouring rain.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.146
Heh. The dude does have
some romance in him.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.441
- But why be so mysterious?
- Maybe he has to be.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.321
Maybe wherever he is
someone's watching him.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.699
Guess it's worth a shot
going out to the dome.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.697
- I'm going alone.
- But we wanna see him.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.784
- And we should be with you.
- I know, but we don't know if it's safe.

22:55.958 --> 22:58.665
It's just something
I need to do by myself.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.169
I'm still not sure we should do this.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.834
Sam, I know it's a risk,

23:09.013 --> 23:12.505
but I have to find out if he knows
a way back into Chester's Mill.

23:12.683 --> 23:14.219
Okay.

23:16.186 --> 23:20.270
But if he has a bad reaction
or I don't get the dosage exactly right...

23:20.441 --> 23:22.352
This is no way for anyone to live.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.936
- You can't...
SAM: Even for him.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.352
But don't get a good lather with it.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.021
It's that dry
and it won't raise the beard.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.359
All right, pal.

23:30.534 --> 23:33.241
That if the soap's dry,

23:33.412 --> 23:34.777
and you won't get a lather,

23:35.414 --> 23:38.372
then you raise that beard, you're--
It's not gonna--

23:38.709 --> 23:40.119
Not gonna be clean.

23:40.461 --> 23:42.201
I'm gonna give you something
to help you out.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.755
You don't wanna-- You don't want...

23:46.091 --> 23:48.503
Want it-- You don't want it to just...

23:50.679 --> 23:52.055
Ow.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.215
It hurt.

24:05.194 --> 24:07.606
- Now what?
- Now we wait.

24:23.045 --> 24:25.502
Oh! Dude, this is getting old!

24:25.673 --> 24:27.288
Why didn't you say
you work for my dad?

24:27.466 --> 24:29.502
Yo, baby steps.
You're wound kind of tight.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.547
- Does he know you found me earlier?
- No. That's between us.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.339
I swear.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.768
- How long have you worked here?
- Ever since they caught me

24:41.939 --> 24:43.520
sneaking into their server
two years ago,

24:43.691 --> 24:45.647
finding out stuff
they didn't want anyone to know.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.605
- So they co-opted you.
- It was that or get tossed to the feds.

24:48.779 --> 24:51.737
So I'm on the payroll, securing
the systems against people like me.

24:51.907 --> 24:56.025
Hey, since we're opening up, how
the hell did you get out of that dome?

24:56.203 --> 24:57.613
And you never answered
my question.

24:57.788 --> 24:59.619
Why is your old man
obsessed with that egg?

24:59.790 --> 25:01.746
Shh! You talk way too much.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.791
- You say you're my friend, right?
- Yeah, man.

25:04.962 --> 25:07.704
Yeah, well, now you're gonna get
a chance to prove that.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.212
You're gonna get me to the dome.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.874
The place where the National Guard
shoots trespassers on sight?

25:12.052 --> 25:14.919
Yeah. And you're gonna do it,
or the military's gonna find out

25:15.097 --> 25:17.509
that you've been breaking
through their firewall.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.558
Certain things are more difficult
to accomplish than others.

25:21.729 --> 25:23.685
Like my dad said, work your magic.

25:27.234 --> 25:30.226
So, what, you're just gonna hole up
here till we catch whoever did this?

25:30.404 --> 25:32.110
No, I'm not lying low for anyone.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.817
So who do you
think'll be mad at you?

25:34.491 --> 25:35.480
This could take a while.

25:35.659 --> 25:38.071
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.531
Some people in this town
aren't my biggest fans.

25:42.583 --> 25:45.120
- Well, there's Roger Lopez.
- Mm-hm.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.704
When the windmill went up,

25:46.879 --> 25:49.586
