She's at the Fillmore all the time.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.909
She's at the Fillmore Lounge?

12:58.978 --> 13:00.969
Yeah, she drinks every day.

13:01.046 --> 13:05.346
She's got the gene, you know?
The disease. Our parents had it, too.

13:06.085 --> 13:08.383
She use drugs?

13:08.454 --> 13:10.217
I think she does a little coke.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.450
How much is a little?

13:12.525 --> 13:18.293
I don't know. Few times a week, maybe.
I mean, how much is a lot?

13:18.364 --> 13:20.798
Few times a week's a lot.

13:20.866 --> 13:23.960
Then she does a lot.
I don't know anything about that.

13:24.036 --> 13:28.439
I put the plug in the jug myself,
I got 23 years sobriety, so, I'm good.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.806
Congratulations.

13:36.081 --> 13:38.049
Do you mind if we see her room?

13:55.100 --> 13:57.864
- Kidnapped the furniture, too?
- Patrick.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.251
WOMAN ON RADIO:
10-7 investigation.

14:18.457 --> 14:20.152
Solved it yet?

14:21.293 --> 14:24.660
Captain, Patrick Kenzie.
This is my associate, Angie Gennaro.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.095
Mmm-hmm?

14:26.432 --> 14:29.026
I see Beatrice went on
and hired someone.

14:30.236 --> 14:32.136
I take it that wasn't
your recommendation.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.432
It was not.

14:34.406 --> 14:37.500
That woman would mortgage her home
to every snake doctor

14:37.576 --> 14:40.670
taking credit cards if she thought
it would help find her niece.

14:40.746 --> 14:44.045
My job's hard enough
without inviting the circus in here.

14:44.116 --> 14:46.607
Captain, this isn't
about the money for us.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.849
You ever investigated
an abduction before?

14:51.924 --> 14:53.391
I think Mrs. McCready was hoping
we could help

14:53.459 --> 14:56.656
with the neighborhood aspect of this
investigation, the people, you know.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.321
How old are you?

14:59.465 --> 15:02.263
- I'm 31.
- He just looks young.

15:08.007 --> 15:11.135
A four-year-old child is on the street.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.804
It's 76 hours and counting.

15:13.879 --> 15:15.574
And the prospects
for where she might be

15:15.648 --> 15:18.048
are beginning to look grim,
you understand?

15:18.117 --> 15:22.076
Half of all the children in these cases
are killed, flat out.

15:22.154 --> 15:24.452
If we don't catch the abductor
by day one,

15:24.523 --> 15:27.321
only about 10% are ever solved.

15:27.393 --> 15:29.327
This is day three.

15:32.164 --> 15:35.065
He may look young,

15:35.134 --> 15:38.228
but if he wants to work this case,
he'd better not act it.

15:38.304 --> 15:41.967
Well, he's been hired by a woman
who's the victim of a crime,

15:42.041 --> 15:44.339
and by law he's entitled
as her representative

15:44.410 --> 15:47.402
to be cooperated with
by the Boston Police Department.

15:47.479 --> 15:49.037
So he expects to be.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.242
And he will be.

15:54.987 --> 15:59.822
He and his better half will be contacted
by two of my senior men,

15:59.892 --> 16:03.658
at their convenience,
and be permitted to observe.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.290
We're just trying to help, Captain.

16:11.904 --> 16:16.398
Look, I don't care who does it.
I just want it done.

16:20.512 --> 16:22.070
Good afternoon.

16:25.284 --> 16:26.376
Ready to get started?

we heard Helene comes in here.

We're not asking
for the combination to the safe.

16:42.968 --> 16:47.632
Listen, I ain't saying a fucking word.
I already talked to the fucking cops.

16:47.706 --> 16:49.901
All right.

16:49.975 --> 16:52.375
- Dave, right?
- Big Dave.

16:52.444 --> 16:54.605
Big Dave. All right.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.945
I'm Medium Patrick. Nice to meet you.

- Oh, yeah.

STEVE: Yeah, listen,
I been fucking everywhere

17:28.714 --> 17:31.740
putting up posters, man, you know?

17:31.817 --> 17:35.719
Every project hallway,
all over City Point, everywhere.

17:35.788 --> 17:36.812
You know? I mean, it's a real tragedy.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.789
She used to come in here,
sit up at the bar and shit.

17:38.857 --> 17:42.054
- You know, she was like our mascot.
- Helene brought Amanda in here?

17:42.127 --> 17:45.995
No, mostly in the afternoons.
I mean, it's no place for a child at night.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.623
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

17:47.699 --> 17:51.135
Hot tempers, lot of drugs, trust me.

17:51.203 --> 17:53.694
So how often Helene come down here?

17:53.772 --> 17:55.137
Five nights a week.

17:55.207 --> 17:58.074
Come on, guys, please.
She's a fucking coke ho, okay?

17:58.143 --> 18:00.338
She's in here fucking doing lines
just about every night.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.380
Trust me, all right?
It's not a real shocker, so...

18:02.448 --> 18:05.315
- She's that bad, huh?
- Huh?

18:05.384 --> 18:07.079
Oh, she's fucking terrible.

18:07.152 --> 18:09.882
Listen, remember that night
when the kid got kidnapped?

18:09.955 --> 18:10.979
You saw her on the news, right?

18:11.056 --> 18:14.787
She's saying, "Oh, I was at my
neighbor's house for a half hour."

18:14.860 --> 18:18.921
Bullshit. She was in here for, like,
two hours bumping rails. Oh, yeah.

18:18.997 --> 18:22.489
- ANGIE: What time did she come in?
- 8:00.

18:22.568 --> 18:24.695
- Are you sure it was the same night?
- Fucking positive,

18:24.770 --> 18:27.864
'cause she was in the shitter,
fucking banging down rails with Ray,

18:27.940 --> 18:29.498
and I was banging on the fucking door.

18:29.575 --> 18:31.770
- Who, Ray? Skinny Ray?
- Yeah. Ray Likanski.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.607
He's in there ducking me
like a fucking faggot.

18:33.679 --> 18:34.668
I was banging on the door.

18:34.746 --> 18:35.804
He thought I didn't know
he was in there,

18:35.881 --> 18:37.473
but I know he's fucking in there.

18:37.549 --> 18:40.575
- Don't lend him any money...
- Hey, Stevie.

18:40.652 --> 18:44.611
- What the fuck you doing?
- Nothing. What's up, Lenny?

18:44.690 --> 18:46.783
Don't talk about people you don't know.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.121
What do you mean?
These are my friends.

18:48.193 --> 18:50.354
- I know them for years.
- What's the problem, guy?

18:50.829 --> 18:52.660
You said you weren't a cop.
Right, "guy"?

18:52.731 --> 18:55.427
- Yeah, I'm not a cop.
- Yeah, then why don't you fuck off?

18:55.501 --> 18:57.332
Why don't you mind your business?

18:57.402 --> 18:59.768
He's gonna come in here
and be a smartass?

18:59.838 --> 19:02.204
You're awfully worried
about people's asses there, Dave.

19:02.274 --> 19:05.573
Yeah, you probably got
a fucking ass like a Skippy jar.

19:05.644 --> 19:09.444
What are you doing here, anyway?
Dave can't make a martini worth a shit.

19:09.515 --> 19:12.177
Trying to help Helene
find her daughter. Is that all right?

19:12.251 --> 19:13.616
Listen, don't come in here
running your mouth,

19:13.685 --> 19:15.380
thinking you're better than me.

19:15.454 --> 19:17.615
I'm not the fucking one.

19:17.689 --> 19:19.589
- All right, just cool it.
- LENNY: Cool it.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.525
- Listen to this douchebag.
- Bet she fucks this asshole in half.

is the matter with you guys?

19:25.898 --> 19:28.128

19:37.042 --> 19:39.169
We're leaving, all right?

I think it's your good looks...

in here tonight.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.563
Open that door, rummy.

20:03.335 --> 20:05.565
- Open the door, Mike.
- Now.

let me know.

20:23.188 --> 20:26.385
How's that, motherfucker?
Now you know.

20:26.458 --> 20:29.427
Keep your fucking mouths closed.

What, you wanna
say some shit, Fat Dave?

20:31.430 --> 20:32.454
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

20:32.531 --> 20:34.795
Make me a martini,
you fucking fat bastard!

20:34.866 --> 20:35.890
- Make it!
- Get the fuck out.

20:35.968 --> 20:39.233
Make me a fucking martini,

21:49.107 --> 21:51.974
and his handsome wife, Roberta.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.136
(PATRICK EXCLAIMS)

21:53.278 --> 21:56.645
The Tretts were released six
and eight months ago, respectively.

21:56.715 --> 21:57.875
They have drug habits.

21:57.949 --> 22:00.713
We don't know where they are,
but we think Corwin's with them.

22:00.786 --> 22:04.381
Jailhouse snitch claims
that Corwin confided in him

22:04.456 --> 22:08.119
and told him when he got out,
he was gonna move in with his family.

22:08.727 --> 22:09.887
Apparently the three of them

22:09.961 --> 22:12.930
have some kind of
Addams Family deal going on.

22:12.998 --> 22:16.365
Corwin's plan is to keep a kid
in the house to have sex with.

22:16.435 --> 22:19.871
- Well, that sounds promising.
- Not for Amanda, it doesn't.

22:19.938 --> 22:21.235
ANGIE: Do you think
this is who has Amanda?

22:21.306 --> 22:22.739
Well, there's a lot
of holes in our theory.

22:22.808 --> 22:25.003
I mean, Corwin likes
little boys, you know?

22:25.077 --> 22:27.944
He likes them seven or eight or nine.

22:29.881 --> 22:33.282
So that's it, that's all we got,
there's no other leads, three days in?

22:33.352 --> 22:34.410
No, we got more.

22:34.486 --> 22:37.046
We got six psychics telling us to look
in six different states,

22:37.122 --> 22:38.817
we got Lionel and Bea
with airtight alibis,

22:38.890 --> 22:40.551
we've interviewed every neighbor
in a mile radius

22:40.625 --> 22:42.354
and we got a convicted finger-blaster

to cut off his ankle bracelet.

to your Harry Potter book.

22:58.543 --> 23:01.603
Isn't it usually somebody
who knows the victim?

23:01.747 --> 23:04.978
I think there's plenty of people
in Helene McCready's life

23:05.050 --> 23:07.348
that are capable of doing this.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.021
So then you probably
talked to Ray Likanski.

23:11.089 --> 23:13.284
- Who?
- Ray Likanski.

- Never heard of him.
- Well, with all due respect,

23:24.669 --> 23:26.830
I think we might be able
to contribute on that point.

23:26.905 --> 23:29.499
- Really? How's that?
- The night Amanda went missing,

23:29.574 --> 23:31.098
Skinny Ray was down
at the Fillmore Lounge

23:31.176 --> 23:33.440

23:55.700 --> 23:57.292
Oh, yeah?
Thought you were from here.

23:57.369 --> 24:00.202
Well, it all depends
on how you look at it.

24:00.772 --> 24:05.607
I mean, you might think that you're
more from here than me, for example.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.807
But I been living here

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:08.558
The little boy's sitting on the bed

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:12.089
holding onto his PlayStation
for dear life.

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:14.692
There's no expression on his face,

01:11:16.238 --> 01:11:18.468
tears streaming down.

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:23.677
He wants to tell me he just learned
his multiplication tables.

01:11:23.746 --> 01:11:24.906
Christ.

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:27.574
I mean, the father's got him
in this crack den,

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:30.346
subsisting on Twinkies
and ass-whippings,

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:36.051
and this little boy just wants someone
to tell him that he's doing a good job.

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:40.527
You're worried what's Catholic?

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:42.723
I mean, kids forgive.

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:46.965
Kids don't judge.

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:49.368
Kids turn the other cheek.

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:52.337
What do they get for it?

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:54.606
So I went back out there,

01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:56.770
I put an ounce of heroin
on the living room floor,

01:11:56.845 --> 01:12:00.212
and I sent the father on a ride,
seven to nine.

01:12:03.452 --> 01:12:06.421
- That was the right thing?
- Fucking A!

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:10.884
You gotta take a side.

01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:16.889
You molest a child, you beat a child,

01:12:18.133 --> 01:12:19.657
you're not on my side.

01:12:19.735 --> 01:12:21.202
If you see me coming, you better run,

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:24.171
because I am gonna
lay you the fuck down!

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:29.267
Easy.

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:36.748
Don't feel easy.

01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:39.687
Is the kid better off without his father?

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:41.648
Yeah.

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.586
But okay, I mean,
could be out there right now,

01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:48.186
pumping with a gun in his waistband.

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:50.762
It's a war, man.

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:53.863
Are we winning?

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:56.963
No.

01:13:02.878 --> 01:13:06.211
Would you do it again?
Clip Corwin Earle?

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:10.216
No.

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:14.849
Does that make you right?

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:18.450
Hmm?

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:20.825
I don't know.

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:23.364
Doesn't make it wrong, though,
does it?

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:32.201
(SIGHS)

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:41.980
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:45.786
How's Remy?

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:49.046
He lied to me.

01:13:50.559 --> 01:13:53.255
What did Remy say about Ray
back in Roxbury?

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:55.159
- Never heard of him.
- Never heard of him.

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:58.290
Now he says Ray's been snitching
for him for 15 years.

01:13:58.567 --> 01:14:00.558
He called him his "old pal."

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:03.503
Said he couldn't find
enough people to snitch out.

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:04.800
Patrick...

01:14:04.873 --> 01:14:07.865
And Ray Likanski is the reason
Amanda got taken in the first place,

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:10.104
and Remy lies about knowing him.

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:14.672
Let it go.

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:17.275
Why would he lie?
What's he have to hide?

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:19.377
Amanda's dead.

01:14:19.888 --> 01:14:21.549
Let it go.

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:26.424
(EXHALES)

01:14:29.565 --> 01:14:30.964
ANGIE: Babe.

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:34.093
Nick died.

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:49.716
Left. Left.

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:57.783
Mr. Kenzie.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:01.019
Nice fucking job on Corwin Earle.

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:13.597
(PRAYING IN LATIN)

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:16.939
Amen.

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:19.708
(PRAYING IN LATIN)

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:55.444
- Sorry about Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.

01:15:57.619 --> 01:16:01.111
I was thinking about our conversation
the other night.

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:03.350
Well, I said some things
I shouldn't have.

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:06.019
You know, too much rum.

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:07.789
Yeah, like what?

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:12.265
Don't fuck with me, Patrick. Not today.

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:15.702
Oh, I wouldn't fuck with you.

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:20.766
Oh, you wanna play it like that, huh?
Okay.

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:25.635
Forget about the other night,
and we'll be friends.

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:29.442
What if I don't?

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:32.976
That's not an "if"
you wanna bring into your life.

01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:37.523
MAN: Had lunch with him last week.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:38.753
Dana had lunch with him last week?

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:40.294
Excuse me.

01:16:40.395 --> 01:16:41.828
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:43.089
Hey, Dev.

01:16:43.565 --> 01:16:47.001
- Hey, how you doing?
- All right, how you been?

01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:49.196
I can't complain.

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:51.705
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

01:16:52.708 --> 01:16:54.573
Not here.

01:16:54.643 --> 01:16:58.044
(SCOFFS) If it's like that, then
you're gonna have to buy me lunch.

01:16:58.113 --> 01:17:01.810
- How's the Chart House, half hour?
- Sounds about right.

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:05.652
Hey, Remy used to work Narcotics
with you, right?

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:07.416
DCU, yeah. What's up?

01:17:07.489 --> 01:17:09.013
Why'd he leave?

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:12.652
Had a habit of just
rubbing people the wrong way.

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:14.787
Like what? What'd he do?

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:17.331
Like marry a prostitute, for one.

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:18.491
Come on.

01:17:18.567 --> 01:17:20.262
Might not wanna do that
if you're a cop, right?

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:21.927
Might not wanna do that
if you're a plumber.

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:23.437
(LAUGHING)

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:25.801
So, what happened?

01:17:25.874 --> 01:17:28.570
He says he loves her,
tells Mike Snell to go fuck himself,

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:29.736
and puts in for a transfer.

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:30.835
What, to Doyle?

01:17:30.912 --> 01:17:34.609
Doyle brought Remy
from Louisiana, back in '72.

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:38.119
You don't think that Remy's
dirty, though, do you?

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:40.051
What's "dirty"?

01:17:41.623 --> 01:17:44.922
- I know he planted evidence once.
- Oh, you do?

01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:48.462
Yeah. Why?

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:51.090
Look, man. CSI is killing us out here.

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:54.693
Every other juror, all they wanna know
is where the microfibers are.

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:56.567
Certain people are workers.

01:17:56.638 --> 01:17:58.265
Don't wanna plant it,
but you know how it is.

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.501
So they don't mind it.

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:06.140
So tell me something,
what you fucking with him for?

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:10.083
He lied to me.

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:12.416
I can't think of one reason
big enough for him to lie

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:15.115
that's small enough not to matter.

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:21.756
All right, look.

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:26.290
I know one thing, but it's third party,
so you gotta play it like that.

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:29.394
Helene and Ray took Cheese's money
back in June, right?

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:30.495
Yeah.

01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:33.541
One week later,
Remy goes to a cop in DCU

01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:36.076
asking if anybody knew
who robbed Cheese.

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:37.338
So what?

01:18:37.412 --> 01:18:39.175
So my informant tells me,

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:42.774
Cheese didn't even know
he got robbed until two weeks later.

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:45.918
So Remy knew Cheese got robbed
before Cheese did?

01:18:45.987 --> 01:18:47.887
How'd he know that?

01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:50.854
Let me tell you something.

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:51.984
You better think long and hard

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:55.052
before you start running around here
investigating the police.

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:59.965
You try and take food out their mouths,
and they will fuck you up.

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:04.471
Thanks for the steak.

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:06.869
All right.

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:21.687
Hey.

01:19:23.725 --> 01:19:25.215
I got it.

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:27.795
PATRICK ON PHONE:
We need to talk to you, Lionel.

01:19:27.863 --> 01:19:29.296
LIONEL ON PHONE:
About what?

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:32.094
About the acoustics in your apartment.

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:33.725
What?

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:35.702
Oh, we live
in a three-decker, too, Lionel.

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:37.636
I got nothing to talk about.

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:40.800
Well, that's fine.
We can talk to the state police.

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:44.071
Meet me at Murphy's Law.

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:04.021
LIONEL ON PHONE: I don't meet him
down Murphy's,

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:05.396
he's gonna call the staties.

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:07.833
REMY ON PHONE: He's putting a
move on you. Don't go down there.

01:20:08.436 --> 01:20:09.994
I can handle Patrick Kenzie.

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:11.766
- This is an oath we took.
- I started this.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.808
- This has to be protected.
- I got things to protect, too.

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:14.967
- Listen to me!
- All right, Remy.

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:17.409
You leave that house,
you're an enemy to me.

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:19.811
- Just trust me, all right?
- No! Trust me!

01:20:19.881 --> 01:20:24.545
Where I come from,
you die with your secrets!

01:20:50.779 --> 01:20:53.213
How long have you known Remy?

01:20:53.281 --> 01:20:56.409
Detective Bressant? Just in...

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:59.749
Met him through
the investigation of Amanda.

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:01.789
- That's it?
- Yeah.

01:21:05.193 --> 01:21:07.354
How long you known Remy?

01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:09.590
What is this?

01:21:09.664 --> 01:21:12.633
They got the Internet, now, Lionel.

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:15.067
You know how it is in town.
Everybody knows everybody.

01:21:15.136 --> 01:21:17.604
No. Everybody don't know everybody.

01:21:17.672 --> 01:21:19.299
- What're you talking about?
- Why you lying?

01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:20.363
I'm not.

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:23.206
You bragged about taking a hard bust
on the first day we met you.

01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:24.836
- No, I didn't.
- Bullshit.

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:27.404
You're hiding something, Lionel,
and you better fucking tell it,

01:21:27.482 --> 01:21:30.417
'cause you came to our house
and you asked us for help.

01:21:30.485 --> 01:21:32.715
And we killed ourselves
trying to save Amanda.

01:21:32.787 --> 01:21:34.618
And I know you ain't being 100%
with me right now,

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:36.623
and it's really fucking pissing me off
that you're lying,

01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:39.159
so you better interrupt me at any time,
'cause I'm about to lose...

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:42.128
Okay. Fine, fine. All right?
Don't have a heart attack.

01:21:43.298 --> 01:21:45.425
I haven't been honest with you.

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:48.469
It's just not something I'm proud of.
You know?

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:51.403
I got in a bar fight back in the day.

01:21:51.473 --> 01:21:52.701
The other guy cracked his skull.

01:21:52.774 --> 01:21:55.265
At some point,
I must've said, "I'll kill you."

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:59.712
So they had me up for attempted.
It's my word against this other guy's.

01:21:59.781 --> 01:22:02.545
Witness testified to my version
and the jury believed him.

01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:05.518
- 'Cause he was a cop.
- Yeah, he testified for me.

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:07.248
So you knew Detective Bressant.

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:09.620
- It's not like we were best friends.
- But you lied.

01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:12.922
- Why did you call Remy?
- He's a cop.

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:14.859
- That's not why you called him, Lionel.
- Come on.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.795
It's a small place.
You heard them arguing.

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:18.457
- They were being loud.
- Who? Who... Who...

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:22.936
So you called Remy, and you and him
took Amanda to blackmail your sister.

01:22:23.004 --> 01:22:24.369
(SCOFFS)

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:27.736
Why would I do that?

01:22:27.809 --> 01:22:30.835
I don't know, Lionel. I really don't know.

01:22:30.912 --> 01:22:33.904
Maybe because after all the
"I put the fucking plug in the jug,"

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:35.973
and the "count your blessings"
and the "watch your language,"

01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:38.212
you're just like everybody else.

01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:40.186
You saw a bag of money
and you wanted it.

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:41.847
And you thought
you could get away with it.

01:22:41.923 --> 01:22:44.050
But Bea called the media
and made a big thing of it.

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:46.491
And then she called us,
and then you were fucked.

01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:48.688
The case is closed, Patrick.
The case is closed.

01:22:48.763 --> 01:22:51.061
Coke-dealing Haitian's
a pretty easy target for a frame.

01:22:51.132 --> 01:22:52.429
- Lionel?
- Excuse me.

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.558
- Look at me.
- Okay. Excuse me.

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:55.262
You took your niece,
and you laid it off on a black guy.

01:22:55.337 --> 01:22:56.565
- Pardon me.
- Lionel, tell me what happened.

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:58.765
Can I get some service?

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.205
Yeah.

01:23:04.012 --> 01:23:05.411
(EXHALES)

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:08.381
What?

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:13.113
- Three shots of Cutty and a tallboy.
- Yeah.

01:23:13.188 --> 01:23:14.678
Thank you.

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:18.016
Just give me a second.

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:52.225
Twenty-three years
is something, right?

01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:06.238
Go.

01:24:10.345 --> 01:24:13.542
I come up to check on Amanda.
She was alone as usual.

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:18.342
I was reading her a story
when Helene and Ray come home.

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.512
They didn't know I was there.

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:23.114
Stop fucking yelling,
my daughter's sleeping in there.

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:24.749
(ARGUING)

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:27.888
They started talking about how
they'd robbed this drug dealer.

01:24:27.962 --> 01:24:30.055
You know what he's fucking gonna do
if he finds out?

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:31.894
What's the monkey gonna do?

01:24:31.966 --> 01:24:33.297
- Oh, you know...
- I'm not...

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:36.531
And they were talking
about leaving the state.

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:38.071
So I called Remy and told him.

01:24:38.139 --> 01:24:40.801
There's another drug run
up to Nashua. Taking cocaine...

01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:42.536
And then what?

01:24:46.314 --> 01:24:47.440
We took her.

01:24:50.285 --> 01:24:53.015
Remy laid out this plan.
It seemed easy.

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:55.955
We take her, force Helene and Ray
to cough up the cash,

01:24:56.024 --> 01:24:58.049
then we put her back. You know?

01:24:58.126 --> 01:25:00.185
Amanda gets to spend
a weekend in the country.

01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:01.785
My sister learns a lesson.

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:04.894
And fuck it, everybody gets paid
on top of it.

01:25:04.966 --> 01:25:07.935
I got no problem taking money
from a guy like Cheese.

01:25:08.002 --> 01:25:09.560
They were gonna handle the cops.

01:25:09.637 --> 01:25:11.867
But Bea, she went nuts.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:14.500
Started calling the papers. Hired you.

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:16.908
Lionel don't want me coming here,
now you don't want the job?

01:25:16.978 --> 01:25:20.971
But once you found the money,
they had Amanda and the money.

01:25:21.049 --> 01:25:25.179
So they decided to set up
a fake exchange for you to witness.

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:27.915
They got Chris Mullen
to set up Cheese at the quarry.

01:25:27.989 --> 01:25:31.584
15K and a chance to be the boss.

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:36.693
Cheese figured out
what was happening.

01:25:36.764 --> 01:25:40.222
Even though it was too late,
he started shooting.

01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:42.235
Panicking.

01:25:44.873 --> 01:25:47.205
And she just fell. I mean, she just...

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:48.936
She fell in.

01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:52.038
She's gone.

01:25:52.113 --> 01:25:54.308
It was an accident.
It was just an accident.

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:56.577
She was your sister's kid, Lionel.

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:02.149
- Your sister's child.
- You think I don't miss her?

01:26:02.223 --> 01:26:04.783
She was more my kid than Helene's.

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:09.990
Last summer, Helene and Dottie
took Amanda to the beach.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:14.295
It was a real hot day.
Amanda fell asleep.

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:17.261
They left her in the car
while they go off into the dunes,

01:26:17.338 --> 01:26:19.101
smoke a doobie with some guys.

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:20.903
Two hours.

01:26:22.644 --> 01:26:25.340
Amanda literally roasted.

01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:28.104
She was three.

01:26:30.885 --> 01:26:35.151
Later on, I was holding her,
trying to help her get to sleep.

01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:40.855
My little Amanda, she was so hot.

01:26:43.097 --> 01:26:46.066
She felt like something
just come out of the oven.

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:49.700
Like a fucking pot roast.

01:26:51.839 --> 01:26:54.171
So don't feel too sorry for my sister.

01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:58.008
Because she never gave a shit
about anyone but herself.

01:26:59.147 --> 01:27:00.045
(DOOR BANGS)

01:27:00.114 --> 01:27:02.947
Bartender. Open the safe. Now.

01:27:04.619 --> 01:27:08.578
Everybody needs to shut up and stay
calm. On the floor. On the floor!

01:27:08.656 --> 01:27:10.317
- Hands on your head. Do it.
- MAN: Oh, my God.

01:27:10.391 --> 01:27:11.983
Everybody stays calm,
this'll be over in a minute.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.995
Hey, do you know
whose bar this is, shithead?

01:27:15.563 --> 01:27:18.430
Or you can get wise, it's up to you.

01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:22.966
What did you say?

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:25.763
You're a talker, huh?

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.398
Just keep revving, motherfucker.

01:27:27.475 --> 01:27:29.568
WOMAN: Don't antagonize him.
He's got a gun.

01:27:29.644 --> 01:27:32.977
- Oh, just keep yapping away.
- I didn't say nothing.

01:27:33.047 --> 01:27:34.912
You should learn
to keep your mouth shut.

01:27:34.983 --> 01:27:36.416
WOMAN: Shut the fuck up,
for Christ's sake.

01:27:36.484 --> 01:27:39.214
- Just keep talking, pal.
- I didn't say nothing.

01:27:39.287 --> 01:27:40.652
Close your eyes.

01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:41.848
- Fuck!
- Remy Bressant.

01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:44.255
Amanda McCready
was taken by Remy Bressant.

01:27:44.325 --> 01:27:47.055
Oh, fuck, God. Amanda McCready
was taken by Remy Bressant!

01:27:47.128 --> 01:27:48.959
- Wait. Wait. Jesus.
- PATRICK: Remy Bressant.

01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:50.588
God damn it. Remy Bressant!

01:27:50.665 --> 01:27:51.723
Amanda McCready was taken

01:27:51.799 --> 01:27:52.925
- by Remy Bressant.
- Jesus. I told him.

01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:55.492
I told him we took her for ransom.
I told him. I told him, Remy.

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:59.006
Please, I told him we took her
for ransom. I did it.

01:27:59.073 --> 01:28:00.938
Remy, please.

01:28:01.175 --> 01:28:02.642
Please.

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:07.646
(GUN FIRES)

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:14.084
(GRUNTING)

01:28:20.928 --> 01:28:22.793
Are you all right?

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:23.888
(PANTING)

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:24.989
Stay with him.

01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:29.125
Drop your gun.

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:32.560
Put it down!

01:29:37.305 --> 01:29:40.797
That bartender wasn't fucking around.

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:51.975
What did you do?

01:29:52.854 --> 01:29:54.344
Did you get her killed?

01:29:57.225 --> 01:29:58.920
Say yes.

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:05.229
Say yes.

01:30:06.167 --> 01:30:07.634
Say yes!

01:30:08.536 --> 01:30:12.700
What're you gonna do? Shoot me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:22.573
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:30:27.054 --> 01:30:29.079
She was a child.

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:33.125
I love children.

01:31:09.964 --> 01:31:13.559
Why would I expose a conspiracy
that I was a part of?

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:18.496
I mean, did Lionel contradict
anything I've said?

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:22.971
Did any of the witnesses at the bar
contradict anything I've said?

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:26.707
A police officer was killed today.
That's not looked on lightly.

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:28.976
Is corruption looked on lightly?

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:30.711
Is a little girl getting killed
looked on lightly?

01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:32.013
OFFICER: Whoa, hold on.

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:34.520
You charge people money
as a detective.

01:31:34.589 --> 01:31:38.525
Now, you're at the quarry
the other night, right?

01:31:38.593 --> 01:31:41.528
And you have no idea
that this is a setup?

01:31:41.596 --> 01:31:43.996
You're baffled. Right?

01:31:45.533 --> 01:31:49.993
No, because, strange as it might seem,

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:53.302
I believe the police
when they tell me something.

01:31:54.008 --> 01:31:55.236
You're a fresh prick. You know that?

01:31:55.309 --> 01:31:57.539
And because I had a ransom note
and Amanda McCready's blanket

01:31:57.612 --> 01:31:58.704
put in my mailbox.

01:31:58.779 --> 01:32:01.805
And because I read a transcript of
a call that Cheese put into the station.

01:32:01.883 --> 01:32:02.975
A 911 call?

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:06.110
No, it was a call
Cheese made to the station.

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:07.484
To Remy Bressant at the station.

01:32:07.555 --> 01:32:09.614
Or that Chris Mullen made,
pretending to be Cheese.

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:11.487
Or whatever the fuck it was,
but it was recorded,

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:13.459
and there was a call.

01:32:13.528 --> 01:32:15.462
We don't record calls
coming into the station,

01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:18.328
and we don't do transcripts, smart guy.

01:32:20.434 --> 01:32:22.994
OFFICER: So, did you hear a tape?

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:26.670
- No, I didn't hear a tape.
- Okay.

01:32:26.741 --> 01:32:28.971
Did you see a transcript?

01:32:33.714 --> 01:32:36.274
No, I must've remembered it wrong.

01:32:46.527 --> 01:32:47.994
Kids forgive.

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:49.552
What do they get for it?

01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:52.064
Amanda literally roasted.

01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:02.569
LIONEL: You think I don't miss her.

01:33:02.643 --> 01:33:05.077
She was more my kid than Helene's.

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:07.273
I love children.

01:33:11.786 --> 01:33:16.018
This is the kind of thing that if you do,
Patrick, you wanna be sure.

01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:20.021
Are you sure?

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:22.127
No.

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:27.832
Are you coming?

01:33:28.469 --> 01:33:29.766
No.

from Louisiana back in '72.

the highlighted portion?

Patrick Kenzie.

To what do I owe the pleasure?

01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:09.869
Remy Bressant died last night.

01:34:10.411 --> 01:34:13.437
I was told. It's a shame.

01:34:14.882 --> 01:34:19.478
Yeah, it's hard to understand.
Because he seemed like a good man.

01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:21.384
He was a good man.

01:34:22.723 --> 01:34:25.385
We don't know
why people do what they do.

01:34:25.726 --> 01:34:28.058
Everybody looks out his own window.

01:34:28.295 --> 01:34:30.456
And everyone's got their reasons.

(DOOR OPENS)

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:42.570
- Hey.
- Hi.

- How are you?
- Good.

01:34:44.011 --> 01:34:46.070
REMY: Nick! They're firing at me.

01:34:46.147 --> 01:34:47.842

They're firing at me!

- Ambush! Ambush!

- Something went in!
- Run. Remy. Run!

LIONEL: Panicking.

01:34:56.524 --> 01:34:59.357
Amanda got scared.
She started running.

01:34:59.427 --> 01:35:02.362
She just fell. I mean, she just fell in.

Chris Mullen

01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:09.468
was gunned down last night

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:10.799
in an apparent robbery.

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:13.999
You go back inside with Frannie.
Papa will come in soon.

01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:15.235
Make you a sandwich, okay?

01:35:15.309 --> 01:35:16.537
- All right.
- That's my girl.

01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:17.634
REMY: Don't go down there.

01:35:17.712 --> 01:35:19.407
If I think he has the evidence,
I'll take the hit.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.606
I got no problem doing the time.

01:35:20.681 --> 01:35:23.115
Fuck up, and it's Amanda and her life.

01:35:23.184 --> 01:35:24.515
JACK: All right.
LIONEL: I got things to protect, too.

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:26.849
REMY: You leave that house,
you're an enemy to me

01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:28.115
and you're a danger to Amanda.

01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:30.316
Please, I told him
we took her for ransom. I did it.

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:32.450
I told him. Remy, please.

01:35:37.598 --> 01:35:38.860
So now you know.

LIONEL: My sister's not stable.
She's on crack.

01:35:42.303 --> 01:35:44.396
She's talking about leaving the state.
I'm scared for my niece.

01:35:44.472 --> 01:35:46.667
- Who's gonna take care of her?
- We'll do something.

01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:48.868
REMY: We'll figure it out.
She's an addict.

Bigot. Drug mule.

Not even his wife.
Or he'll never see her again.

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:03.913
It's worth it to him.
Know she'll have a better life.

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.097
REMY: Enough.

01:36:15.903 --> 01:36:17.700
Does it make you feel better?

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:21.939
Telling yourself you did it
for the right reasons?

01:36:22.009 --> 01:36:24.341
That you took her to be saved.

01:36:24.411 --> 01:36:26.276
From her own mother?

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:31.646
We're just trying to give
a little girl a life.

01:36:32.887 --> 01:36:36.220
Wasn't your life to give.
Helene's her mother.

01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:39.020
If you thought she was a bad mother,
you should've gone to Social Services.

01:36:39.093 --> 01:36:43.029
Short of that, she's her mother,
and that's where she belongs.

01:36:44.431 --> 01:36:46.456
You turn around.

01:36:46.534 --> 01:36:50.732
You go back to your fucking car,
and you wait 30 years.

01:36:52.206 --> 01:36:54.697
You don't know
what the world is made of yet.

01:36:56.977 --> 01:37:00.071
I'm calling state police in five minutes.
They'll be here in ten.

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:02.911
Thought you would've
done that by now.

01:37:05.252 --> 01:37:07.482
You know why you haven't?

01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:13.326
Because you think
this might be an irreparable mistake.

01:37:13.394 --> 01:37:18.058
Because deep inside you, you know
it doesn't matter what the rules say.

01:37:18.132 --> 01:37:20.191
When the lights go out
and you ask yourself,

01:37:20.267 --> 01:37:24.169
"Is she better off here or better off
there," you know the answer.

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:26.229
And you always will.

01:37:28.108 --> 01:37:33.171
You... You could do a right thing here.

01:37:33.247 --> 01:37:34.976
A good thing.

without getting this chance.

You walk away from it,

01:37:40.154 --> 01:37:42.452
you may not regret it
when you get home.

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:43.888
You may not regret it for a year,

01:37:43.958 --> 01:37:47.621
but when you get to where I am,
I promise you, you will.

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:52.865
I'll be dead, you'll be old. But she...

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:58.132
She'll be dragging around a couple of
tattered, damaged children of her own,

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:02.740
and you'll be the one
who has to tell them you're sorry.

01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:05.939
You know what? Maybe that'll happen.

01:38:06.013 --> 01:38:10.177
And if it does, I'll tell them I'm sorry,
and I'll live with it.

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:14.715
But what's never gonna happen
and what I'm not gonna do

01:38:14.788 --> 01:38:16.517
is have to apologize
to a grown woman

01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:17.648
who comes to me and says,

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:19.818
"I was kidnapped
when I was a little girl,

01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:22.124
"and my aunt hired you to find me.

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:25.757
"And you did, you found me
with some strange family.

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:28.631
"But you broke your promise
and you left me there.

01:38:28.702 --> 01:38:31.569
"Why? Why didn't you bring me home?

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:36.503
"Because all the snacks and the outfits
and the family trips don't matter.

01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:40.805
"They stole me.

"It wasn't my family
and you knew about it

01:38:44.685 --> 01:38:47.882
"and you knew better
and you did nothing."

01:38:49.623 --> 01:38:51.147
And maybe that grown woman
will forgive me,

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:53.693
but I'll never forgive myself.

01:38:57.865 --> 01:39:02.598
I did what I did for the sake of the child.

01:39:04.238 --> 01:39:07.867
All right. For me, too.

01:39:10.544 --> 01:39:15.846
But now, I'm asking you
for the sake of the child.

01:39:18.519 --> 01:39:20.350
I'm begging you.

01:39:25.492 --> 01:39:27.483

01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:38.499
She's happy.

01:39:40.207 --> 01:39:41.640
What?

01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:44.906

and he makes her sandwiches?

Because he loves her.

- Helene loves her, too.
- Helene doesn't treat her that way.

01:40:07.401 --> 01:40:09.335
Well, maybe she'll change.

01:40:09.603 --> 01:40:11.594
She won't change.
People don't change.

Helene is arsenic.

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:15.570

"and we're gonna
make everything okay."

01:40:24.918 --> 01:40:27.045
Everything will be okay.

01:40:27.121 --> 01:40:28.247
Because we're gonna leave her here,

01:40:28.322 --> 01:40:30.483
and every now and then
we're gonna talk about her.

01:40:30.557 --> 01:40:33.685
And where she is,
and about what grade she's in.

01:40:34.328 --> 01:40:37.786
And that'll be okay, because
we're gonna know what school she's in,

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:40.231
and we're gonna know she's happy,
and she's got birthday parties,

01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:43.269
and she smiles every day,
and she has sleepovers.

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:47.563
Baby, I'm sorry.

01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:51.270

to do something that I can't do.
