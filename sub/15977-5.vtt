WEBVTT

02:51.838 --> 02:54.671
How long do you think until
you can ID all the girls?

02:54.716 --> 02:57.833
Well, we're working
on it, but who's to say.

02:57.844 --> 03:01.211
If you'd found them sooner, there
wouldn't be so much animal activity.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.339
They'd still have their faces.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.398
What about Lieutenant
Skinner? Why haven't you started on him?

03:17.406 --> 03:21.069
Deputy commissioner said
he wanted to attend the autopsy.

03:21.076 --> 03:24.034
Wants me to wait. Politics, I guess.

03:29.626 --> 03:33.539
Once the deputy com signs off,
I want a copy of the full autopsy.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.038
Forensic and ballistic evidence on Skinner.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.381
- You got it?
- Okay.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.098
Reddick's got nothing.

03:47.102 --> 03:49.058
He's got everything.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.269
It's all circumstantial.

03:51.273 --> 03:56.233
There's no way he can prove those bullets
came from my gun. Nothing has changed.

03:56.236 --> 04:00.229
We should keep working our case,
focus on Margaret. We'll be fine.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.315
That's Kallie.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.038
That's her earring.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.254
Look at me.

04:21.219 --> 04:24.177
It's our word versus his.

04:24.181 --> 04:27.844
We stay focused, we keep our
stories straight and our mouths shut,

04:27.851 --> 04:29.842
we get through this.

04:29.853 --> 04:32.265
- Dad? Dad?
- Bethany.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.809
- Get away. Oh, my God, Dad!
- Sweetheart.

04:34.816 --> 04:38.149
- Bethany. Shh.
- Dad! Dad!

04:38.153 --> 04:40.735
Dad! Oh, my God, Dad.

04:40.739 --> 04:43.276
Get her out of here. Get her out of here.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.195
- Linden, where the hell are you going?
- Daddy.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.034
Daddy.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.787
I'm a police officer,
get out of my way.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.411
I'm sorry, ma'am, but
we've been given strict orders.

04:57.422 --> 05:01.665
Colonel Rayne, I have
some questions for you!

05:01.676 --> 05:06.511
Detective, get ahold of yourself.

05:07.349 --> 05:10.261
You can only hide behind
these walls for so long.

05:10.268 --> 05:14.011
This is private property, do I need to
get a restraining order to keep you away?

05:14.022 --> 05:17.560
Your car was spotted at a gas station
between here and the Stansbury house

05:17.567 --> 05:18.272
the night of the murder.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.188
So that's why
you've been harassing me?

05:22.072 --> 05:25.940
And I know you sat outside the Stansbury
house late at night, early in the morning.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.158
I saw pictures of your car.
What were you doing there?

05:28.161 --> 05:30.618
What do you think I've
been doing there, Detective?

05:31.748 --> 05:33.204
You tell me.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.248
Your desperation is understandable.

05:36.253 --> 05:40.622
But I find it sloppy and pathetic
that a woman in your position

05:40.632 --> 05:45.376
lets her emotions compromise
her judgment so easily.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.098
I'm getting a warrant.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.969
When I come back here I'm taking you down.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.485
Colonel Rayne wants to see you, cadet.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.703
Enter.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.872
Ma'am.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.744
- Good morning, cadet.
- Good morning, ma'am.

06:20.755 --> 06:23.041
I'm sorry about last night. I was...

06:23.049 --> 06:24.209
I overreacted.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.879
Thank you for helping me see
the situation for what it was.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.843
Of course.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.384
Your state of mind was
completely understandable

06:31.391 --> 06:34.007
considering the circumstances.

06:34.019 --> 06:37.762
I'm happy to know that
you have moved past it.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.437
I don't know if you're aware,

06:43.445 --> 06:46.482
but tomorrow is Family
Day for first-year cadets.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.400
If you feel

06:48.408 --> 06:51.150
uncomfortable about attending
any of the activities

06:51.161 --> 06:54.494
- and would like to be excused...
- No, ma'am. I'm fine.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.033
Kyle...

07:02.547 --> 07:04.412
if you would like to talk further about

07:04.424 --> 07:09.043
what happened last night or anything else,

07:09.054 --> 07:11.887
you know you can talk
to me. About anything.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.006
I know that, ma'am, but I'm okay.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.682
Very well, then.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.597
Dismissed, cadet.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.876
Get the fuck out of here.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.456
I know you put those plans in my textbook.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.046
And that gun on my desk.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.465
You don't know shit.

07:52.472 --> 07:56.090
I know more than you think I do.
It's coming back, all of it.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.183
Everything that happened
that night is coming back to me.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.474
I totally don't believe you.

08:04.025 --> 08:08.644
But if you did remember, you
wouldn't be butt buddies with AJ.

08:11.157 --> 08:14.615
You still don't remember what he did to
you that last fucking Family Day?

08:14.619 --> 08:16.610
What are you talking about?

08:18.540 --> 08:21.373
Why don't you go look at
that picture of your mom.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.496
See if you remember why we all got one.

08:30.802 --> 08:34.169
Bang, you're dead.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.352
- What do you got?
- Where the hell you been?

08:50.363 --> 08:53.150
Did you get anything on
Margaret's car? Come on, Holder.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.741
Been chasing paper on Margaret all morning.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.531
Cell phone records? Bank statements?

08:58.538 --> 09:04.249
I've gone through it all. None of the
usual red flags, but I did find this.

09:05.587 --> 09:09.626
Philip Stansbury's credit card
records cross-referenced with Margie.

09:09.632 --> 09:14.296
Past couple of years, they got
corresponding out of town hotel bills.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.841
Olympia, Portland, Vancouver.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.468
Same cities, same dates.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.807
They were having an affair.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.553
Sounds like a bunch of
out-of-town fuck fests to me.

09:25.857 --> 09:28.018
You put in for a warrant
to impound her car, right?

09:28.026 --> 09:29.357
I haven't heard back yet.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.861
What the hell's taking so long?

09:30.862 --> 09:32.978
We have more than enough
PC. Call them back.

09:32.989 --> 09:36.447
- Now.
- All right, chill, Linden.

09:36.451 --> 09:39.409
Do some push-ups or something.

09:46.336 --> 09:49.078
Yeah, it's Detective Holder, badge 4592.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.796
Yeah, I put in for a warrant this morning.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.506
Yeah, that's the one.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.378
Are you fucking kidding me?

10:00.850 --> 10:03.592
Yeah, whatever, whatever.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.559
It was denied.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.065
That's bullshit.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.474
I'll have to re-file.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.151
Where are you going?

10:17.158 --> 10:18.614
Linden.

10:27.877 --> 10:32.837
Caroline, we need a warrant approved.
Right now, it can't wait.

10:32.841 --> 10:35.583
Excuse me for a moment. I'm sorry.

10:35.593 --> 10:36.628
What are you doing here?

10:36.636 --> 10:40.379
One of our warrants was denied, and we
need to know what the hell's going on.

10:40.390 --> 10:44.633
Never happened to us before.
Doesn't add up, we got the PC.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.260
- Which judge denied it?
- Chamberlain.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.637
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.640
I'll make some calls in the morning,
try to find out what his reasoning was.

10:51.651 --> 10:55.519
No, we can't wait. It can't be tomorrow,
it needs to be right now.

10:55.530 --> 10:59.114
We just got hit with 10 more
bodies in the Pied Piper case.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.824
Not to mention your Lieutenant
Skinner being found dead.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.693
Things are a little crazy right now.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.663
If you don't want to help us do
our job, you can just say that.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.782
Hey, Linden, chill.

11:08.793 --> 11:13.082
I'll do what I can to help you,
but it'll have to wait. I'm sorry.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.792
What is her problem?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.216
Just do what you can.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.722
How long is Jack in town?

11:33.067 --> 11:35.274
Until tomorrow night.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.020
Maybe you should go
spend some time with him.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.317
You know? Go get a burger or something.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.236
What's that supposed to mean?

11:43.328 --> 11:46.070
You need to calm the fuck down, Linden.

11:46.831 --> 11:50.119
You can't be running around burning
the only bridges we got left.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.617
We're not gonna get through this.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.753
I thought you wanted to solve this case.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.297
Ido.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.835
You can't steamroll Caroline like that.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.008
And we need her help.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.382
Whatever.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.351
Give me the keys.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.813
It's my car. I don't want
you smoking in it.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.583
She's here, right?

12:43.012 --> 12:45.344
I saw the bodies on the news.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.931
They have my little girl too, right?

12:49.936 --> 12:51.722
They found her?

12:58.861 --> 13:00.397
She's at the morgue.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.993
Can I see her?

13:10.498 --> 13:12.363
That's not a good idea.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.121
I just want to say goodbye.

13:16.129 --> 13:20.463
Ijust wanna talk to her, I got
so many things I gotta tell her.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.253
I need to see her. I need...

13:23.261 --> 13:25.593
I need to see her face
just one more time. She's...

13:25.596 --> 13:27.052
You can't.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.140
- Fuck you, you can't stop me.
- There's nothing left to see.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.264
She doesn't even have a face anymore.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.689
She doesn't look like a human being.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.643
You want to see that?

13:43.698 --> 13:46.110
Wanna say goodbye to that?
Let's go, come on, let's go.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.857
Let's go say goodbye to Kallie. Let's go.

13:47.869 --> 13:50.155
You have no right!

13:50.830 --> 13:53.617
No right.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.766
Gotta love that feeling.

15:00.650 --> 15:04.188
It's a rough case. We've all been there.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.777
No, no, no, that's not what I meant.

15:06.781 --> 15:09.238
You know that feeling, that moment...

15:10.243 --> 15:12.609
that split second

15:13.329 --> 15:15.035
when you look across
the table at your guy

15:15.039 --> 15:17.701
and they still think
they got away with it?

15:19.377 --> 15:20.833
But you know it's over.

15:36.227 --> 15:37.808
I know.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.015
Skinner was the Pied Piper.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.986
It's Bethany's ring.

15:50.158 --> 15:53.400
Photos of Skinner's car following Adrian.

15:55.163 --> 15:59.782
Your gun conveniently being stolen.

16:02.128 --> 16:05.370
I know you and Holder were
both out at the lake that night.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.260
You pulled the trigger, didn't you?

16:20.563 --> 16:22.849
I've misjudged you.

16:25.109 --> 16:28.226
You're even more
incompetent than I thought.

16:32.909 --> 16:36.447
Because if you had anything more
than this fucked-up, made-up story,

16:36.454 --> 16:38.615
I'd be in cuffs right now.

16:43.503 --> 16:47.667
It's only a matter of time
until I get proof.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.881
The bad guys all make mistakes.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.178
Ask your partner.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.185
Only reason we dredged the lake

17:00.186 --> 17:02.677
is because Holder blabbed

17:02.688 --> 17:05.725
at a NA meeting
about what you two did.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.861
It's always the one with the conscience.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.271
That's messed up, AJ.

17:51.279 --> 17:54.146
It's a standing order. Always.

17:54.156 --> 17:58.490
And if she don't like it, you just bend
her over and yell, "Fire in the hole!"

17:59.120 --> 18:00.360
Every single time.

19:18.783 --> 19:21.149
I just got off
the phone with one of the ADAs

19:21.160 --> 19:24.152
who used to clerk for Judge Chamberlain.

19:24.163 --> 19:28.406
Apparently, the judge is an alum and
large contributor to St. George's,

19:28.417 --> 19:30.533
and he's not the only one.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.623
Just go to another judge. I
mean, there's dozens of them.

19:33.631 --> 19:36.088
Yeah, sure, but you'd be
committing career suicide.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.628
You go behind his back,

19:37.635 --> 19:41.423
Chamberlain will make sure that no
judge ever signs a warrant for you again.

19:43.307 --> 19:47.050
The head of St. George's filed
a formal complaint with the DA

19:47.061 --> 19:50.053
against you and Sarah for harassment.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.733
You have to think about
your priorities, Stephen.

19:56.445 --> 20:01.565
You can't afford to throw away your
career or our future over some case.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.041
Have a good day.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.509
Skinner was found at Sawyer?
I tell you, we're gonna get this guy.

20:29.520 --> 20:32.262
- Not sure they found the bodies.
- Yeah, well, there's two.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.138
Two officers down there right now.

20:34.150 --> 20:37.438
I heard that.
Skinner's autopsy report...

20:38.904 --> 20:40.895
We need to get that
warrant on Margaret's car.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.568
She could be destroying
evidence as we speak.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.617
I've been doing some digging
into Margaret's background.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.828
I contacted a friend of mine at Justice.

20:50.541 --> 20:53.408
Seems she was honorably discharged
from the Army during Iraq.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.499
We're fucked.

20:56.005 --> 20:59.623
Chamberlain is a St. George
alum and a bigtime booster.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.248
Never gonna get that warrant.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.125
We're going to a different judge, then.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.469
You do that and both our careers are over.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.304
We don't do that, we can't help Kyle.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.048
Is he the only one you care about?

21:13.606 --> 21:16.814
You see this fucking shitstorm
we're right in the middle of, right?

21:17.860 --> 21:20.067
Caroline's got you by the balls.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.155
It's you and me, Linden.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.442
We're on the same team, remember?

21:29.246 --> 21:30.497
Are we?

21:36.962 --> 21:40.295
Ijust wanted to set the
record straight, detectives.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.176
My vehicle's parked outside.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.554
How long do you think it'll take
your people to search my car?

21:49.558 --> 21:51.264
Depends on what they find.

21:54.230 --> 21:57.017
Judge Chamberlain sends his regards.

21:57.024 --> 22:00.892
He hopes you're doing everything you
can to solve the Stansbury murders.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.983
You and Philip Stansbury were
having an affair, weren't you?

22:05.699 --> 22:07.075
Yes, we were.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.816
Ca re to elaborate?

22:08.828 --> 22:12.195
What kind of details
would you like, detective?

22:12.873 --> 22:15.285
How long was it going on for?

22:15.292 --> 22:17.544
On and off for the past few years.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.207
So you must have known
his house inside out, then.

22:20.214 --> 22:23.832
You guys meet up there when the wife and
the kids were on their dressage lessons?

22:23.843 --> 22:26.334
No, we would rendezvous
when he was out of town.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.711
Taking Kyle to his piano
competitions and recitals.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.338
Aw, ain't that sweet?

22:32.059 --> 22:34.550
But the affair wasn't
enough for you, was it?

22:35.688 --> 22:37.770
You wanted more.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.568
You watched him, you followed him.

22:45.239 --> 22:48.652
That's your car, isn't it, Margaret?

22:50.035 --> 22:52.526
I know women like you.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.241
Alone in the world.

22:57.793 --> 23:01.377
No one to come home to,
nothing but an empty house.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.628
Time's running out and you
feel it every day, don't you?

23:08.679 --> 23:12.342
Did Philip promise to
leave his wife for you?

23:13.893 --> 23:16.475
Were you pathetic enough to believe him?

23:17.771 --> 23:24.768
I didn't kill him and massacre his
entire family, if that's your point.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.484
Bet he got tired of you.

23:31.160 --> 23:36.075
Moved on to greener pastures.
That's when you snapped.

23:37.124 --> 23:40.992
Hell hath no fury like
a crazy psycho bitch.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.092
Results on the car, detective.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.601
That's convenient.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.971
You got your car
completely re-upholstered.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.474
- When'd you do that?
- Recently.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.977
Cleanliness is a form of self-respect.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.445
Something you might want
to practice more often.

24:12.660 --> 24:15.743
And if you need to know my whereabouts
the night of the Stansbury tragedy,

24:15.746 --> 24:19.455
I was attending a school fundraiser
at the Four Seasons Hotel downtown.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.289
Can anyone corroborate this?

24:21.293 --> 24:25.753
My friend Charles Ross
was with me all night.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.877
He'll verify what I just told you.

24:28.884 --> 24:32.047
You can find him at the
dance studio he owns.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.464
- He's my instructor.
- I'll bet he is.

24:39.478 --> 24:43.847
Not everything is always
what it seems, Detective.

24:43.857 --> 24:46.473
Why did you leave the Army?

24:47.444 --> 24:49.526
You were a Black Hawk pilot, correct?

24:51.699 --> 24:55.487
My service ended.
I was honorably discharged.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.995
It was time to walk away.

24:56.996 --> 25:00.409
But you didn't walk away,
you were forced out.

25:00.416 --> 25:03.158
Because of what happened in the Gulf
when your helicopter went down.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.374
You killed civilians.

25:12.636 --> 25:17.471
Have you ever fired your weapon, Detective?

25:18.392 --> 25:21.350
Or watched someone die
right in front of you?

25:23.397 --> 25:25.809
Hindsight is not a luxury
that a soldier has.

25:25.816 --> 25:27.647
We were in hostile territory,

25:27.651 --> 25:31.269
a car approached, but didn't
heed our warning shots.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.022
I ordered my men to eliminate the threat.

25:34.033 --> 25:37.821
I gave an order and I
would give that order again.

25:38.579 --> 25:41.116
I accepted and I still
accept the consequences

25:41.123 --> 25:43.865
that the military handed down to me.

25:43.876 --> 25:47.209
That is the way that
things work in my world.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.954
But your men didn't listen
to your order, did they?

25:53.969 --> 25:57.336
So you were the one that
opened fire on the threat.

26:01.351 --> 26:03.478
A father and his
three-year-old son.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.232
What was it like?

26:11.028 --> 26:13.440
Watching them die in front of you?

26:57.366 --> 26:59.231
What are you doing here, cadet?

27:00.536 --> 27:03.198
I'm... I'm looking for Colonel Rayne.

27:03.205 --> 27:06.493
- She's off campus till this evening.
- For what?

27:10.254 --> 27:12.495
Is there something
I can help you with, cadet?

28:47.017 --> 28:49.850
I didn't realize you knew where I lived.

28:49.853 --> 28:52.060
I looked it up.

28:56.109 --> 28:58.395
Would you like some coffee
or something to drink?

28:58.403 --> 28:59.563
I've got some cake and...

28:59.571 --> 29:01.482
No, I don't want anything.

29:02.532 --> 29:04.193
Thank you.

29:07.204 --> 29:08.865
I...

29:11.333 --> 29:13.870
I need you to do something for me.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.498
If...

29:17.506 --> 29:22.000
If anything happens to me
or if I have to go away...

29:22.844 --> 29:25.551
I need you to take care of Jack.

29:29.309 --> 29:34.099
He doesn't have anywhere else to go,
no one else to take care of him.

29:34.106 --> 29:37.724
I've never asked you for anything.

29:37.734 --> 29:40.020
Of course.

29:42.155 --> 29:43.861
What's going on?

29:46.493 --> 29:48.779
Sarah, what's going on?

29:52.666 --> 29:54.372
It's nothing.

30:00.674 --> 30:02.539
Is that your husband?

30:03.802 --> 30:07.761
Yes. He passed three years ago.

30:08.515 --> 30:10.551
He was a good man.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.933
And that's Matt and Clara.

30:31.621 --> 30:33.202
Why do you have this?

30:34.082 --> 30:37.290
I never stopped
thinking about you, Sarah.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.502
Thinking about that day.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.460
The parade in Ballard,

30:44.468 --> 30:47.835
and you insisted on getting that pinwheel.

30:47.846 --> 30:52.590
You said you liked it
because it was red like our hair.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.306
I remember.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.982
I remember it was summer.

31:02.986 --> 31:07.605
The air smelled like caramel,
caramel popcorn.

31:09.743 --> 31:12.860
And I remember hoping
that day would last forever.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.163
But then it got dark,

31:17.167 --> 31:20.580
the crowd started pushing
to get a better look,

31:20.587 --> 31:23.329
and I dropped my pinwheel

31:23.340 --> 31:25.797
to hold your hand

31:25.801 --> 31:28.292
and somehow it just got

31:28.303 --> 31:30.464
swept away.

31:33.475 --> 31:35.932
And then you were gone too.

31:43.860 --> 31:47.193
I don't remember how long
it took you to find me.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.319
But it felt like forever.

31:56.665 --> 31:59.498
Why did you let go of my hand?

32:05.382 --> 32:07.464
Iwas young...

32:08.301 --> 32:10.257
and alone.

32:11.805 --> 32:13.761
I was afraid...

32:20.272 --> 32:24.185
It was hard to stay.

32:27.529 --> 32:29.861
It's always been hard for me.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.492
I'm not good at staying.

32:38.999 --> 32:41.331
I think you're a lot like me.

33:28.590 --> 33:32.003
Thank you, ma'am, cadet.
Welcome to St. George's.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.425
Ma'am.

33:40.185 --> 33:43.643
This is a great day for your son, ma'am.
We'll take good care of him.

33:43.647 --> 33:46.013
- You enjoy the rest of the day.
- Kyle?

33:47.317 --> 33:49.023
What do you want?

33:49.819 --> 33:52.105
AJ told me to be ready
and waiting at midnight.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.773
- For what?
- I don't know.

33:56.785 --> 34:00.369
I guess it's some tradition they
do every Family Day for new cadets.

34:02.165 --> 34:04.030
Did they do it to you?

34:05.752 --> 34:08.368
Hey, Jake, you gotta
wait over there, buddy.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.961
Okay.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.503
Go back to your room.

34:15.428 --> 34:17.840
Go. Now.

34:25.105 --> 34:27.471
AJ put one on my door.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.416
Can I help you?

34:49.838 --> 34:52.204
Detective Linden, Detective Holder.

34:52.215 --> 34:54.957
Seattle Homicide. You Charles Ross?

34:54.968 --> 34:56.754
Yes, I am. What's going on?

34:56.761 --> 34:59.468
We have questions
about some murders.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.885
My apologies, Amanda,
we'll pick up here next week?

35:02.892 --> 35:04.223
Sure.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.721
How long have you known Margaret Rayne?

35:08.773 --> 35:11.890
She's been a student of mine
for the past four or five years.

35:11.901 --> 35:13.516
We dance twice a week.

35:13.528 --> 35:16.395
Your relationship isn't just
professional though, is it?

35:18.033 --> 35:19.148
What do you mean by that?

35:19.159 --> 35:22.697
Come on, Chuck, we've
all seen Dirty Dancing.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.413
Were you with Margaret
the night of March 7th?

35:27.417 --> 35:29.123
The night the family was murdered?

35:29.127 --> 35:31.834
Yeah. I...

35:31.838 --> 35:35.330
I was helping her schmooze at a
fundraiser at the downtown Four Seasons.

35:35.342 --> 35:37.708
And after the fundraiser?

35:39.888 --> 35:42.504
Did she pay you
to stay with her all night?

35:43.808 --> 35:45.594
It's not what you think.

35:45.602 --> 35:48.685
- It never is, is it?
- Margaret enjoys my company,

35:48.688 --> 35:50.269
and I enjoy hers.

35:50.315 --> 35:53.728
What transpired between us was as friends.

35:54.361 --> 35:58.104
We didn't have sex, detective.
We just slept in the same bed.

35:58.698 --> 36:00.654
She likes to be held.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.149
What's the crime in that?

36:02.160 --> 36:04.867
That's it? GI. Jane just wants a hug?

36:06.331 --> 36:07.821
Look.

36:09.042 --> 36:10.873
Margaret told me

36:10.877 --> 36:14.165
she lost a child a long time ago.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.255
I think it's the only thing she
hasn't been able to get over.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.214
She has a lot of regrets.

36:19.219 --> 36:20.379
Bullshit.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.296
Let's go to the hotel and
check the security tapes.

36:24.307 --> 36:28.471
If you are lying to me, I'm coming back
here and arresting you for obstruction.

36:28.478 --> 36:30.264
Linden, let's go.

36:42.492 --> 36:44.198
I miss you too.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.318
Like, a lot.

36:46.329 --> 36:49.071
Didn't you get my stalker texts?

36:50.291 --> 36:52.418
Yeah, I love you.

36:52.419 --> 36:55.627
I mean, it's, like, obvious, right?

36:57.841 --> 36:59.752
My grandma?

36:59.759 --> 37:03.468
She was, whatever. Old, but nice.

37:03.471 --> 37:05.587
My mom lost it on her.

37:06.683 --> 37:08.594
I don't know.

37:08.601 --> 37:11.263
You should see this place.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.189
Ijust feel bad about
lying to her, you know?

37:17.444 --> 37:20.060
Saying that my dad didn't want me.

37:21.698 --> 37:23.313
But, like,

37:23.324 --> 37:26.236
she's just got no one else.

37:26.244 --> 37:30.783
And I don't want her
to be alone all the time.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.746
I mean,

37:32.751 --> 37:36.619
I guess I just wish she still
had someone to talk to.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.597
Well, if you're not gonna
hold yours, hold mine.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.815
My back's sore.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.778
Those black aiguillettes on the doorknobs,

38:04.449 --> 38:08.158
I had one on my door. It was on Family Day.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.577
The night my family was killed.

38:11.581 --> 38:13.537
What do they mean?

38:13.541 --> 38:16.248
Why does AJ put them on the doors?

38:16.252 --> 38:19.289
What are you hiding from me?

38:19.297 --> 38:21.538
Quit playing games with me and tell me.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.505
Don't come to the showers tonight.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.250
What? Why?

38:25.261 --> 38:27.968
- Get the fuck away from me, man.
- Why?

38:27.972 --> 38:31.635
- Fucking faggot.
- Why? Why?

38:49.202 --> 38:51.318
He's remembering.

38:51.329 --> 38:54.241
He won't stop asking me about that night.

38:54.249 --> 38:57.537
I'm telling you, he's
not leaving this alone.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.201
Lincoln's right.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.457
It's just a matter of time.

39:02.465 --> 39:05.502
- Well, what the fuck are we gonna do?
- Nothing. Nothing.

39:05.510 --> 39:09.298
We stick with the plan and
everything will be fine.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.681
The plan's falling apart.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.389
You told us the doctor said
Kyle would never remember.

39:13.393 --> 39:16.009
- We have to do something now.
- No.

39:16.020 --> 39:19.512
I told you to keep an eye on
him in case his memory came back.

39:19.524 --> 39:22.357
Nothing has changed. Kyle still
doesn't remember anything...

39:22.360 --> 39:27.821
- Ijust told you that he does...
- No, you are wrong.

39:27.824 --> 39:30.531
Now, both of you need to calm down,

39:30.535 --> 39:34.244
and stop acting like
hysterical, stupid children.

39:35.206 --> 39:38.448
Stupid? Well, ifI hadn't gone
back in the house that night

39:38.459 --> 39:40.495
to get that other gun, we'd be fucked.

39:40.503 --> 39:44.371
You are out of order, cadet.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.215
And you shouldn't have put that damn
gun in Kyle's room, and those plans.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.334
What the hell were you thinking?

39:50.013 --> 39:52.345
You were lucky that AJ found them
before something else happened.

39:52.348 --> 39:55.840
Well, if Kyle would've just blown his
damn brains out, this would all be over.

39:55.852 --> 39:59.344
I am done talking about this.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.855
You need to leave, both of you, right now.

40:02.859 --> 40:08.525
No. I followed your plan and trusted
you from the very beginning.

40:09.282 --> 40:11.318
I even became that loser's friend.

40:12.744 --> 40:16.578
I've done everything you said
to protect us and this academy.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.783
Now, we're gonna find out
exactly what he remembers.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.620
Kyle

40:25.632 --> 40:29.545
is not to be touched.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.961
Do you understand me?

40:34.140 --> 40:36.301
You're getting soft, Colonel.

40:36.309 --> 40:41.019
And frankly, you're
coddling that little shit.

40:43.566 --> 40:49.277
Don't you ever disrespect me.

40:53.034 --> 40:56.447
You have your orders. Dismissed.

40:58.081 --> 40:59.321
Dismissed.

41:01.334 --> 41:03.040
Dismissed.

41:09.509 --> 41:13.468
Between 2-buck Chuck's alibi and the
security cameras at the Four Seasons,

41:13.471 --> 41:16.634
there's no way Margaret's the shooter.
We're spinning our wheels, Linden.

41:16.641 --> 41:19.508
Just because she didn't pull the trigger
doesn't mean she didn't give the order.

41:19.519 --> 41:24.263
She's got 250 toy soldiers at her disposal
and all of them can't wait to kill.

41:24.273 --> 41:26.764
We've gotta get in there.
Kyle's in trouble.

41:26.776 --> 41:30.268
You're paranoid. This ain't
"Bombs Over Baghdad."

41:30.279 --> 41:32.361
Margaret could still try to kill him.

41:32.365 --> 41:35.072
She killed a child before,

41:35.076 --> 41:36.862
she'll do whatever it
takes to protect herself.

41:36.869 --> 41:39.326
If she wanted to kill him,
he'd already be dead.

41:41.249 --> 41:44.082
How the fuck you know Kyle's so innocent?
Maybe he's the one taking her orders.

41:44.085 --> 41:47.828
- You ever consider that?
- No, he's telling me the truth.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.455
I trust him. I can see it in his eyes.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.379
He's not the one lying to me.

41:54.429 --> 41:56.169
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

41:57.015 --> 41:59.552
I know what you said at the NA meeting.

42:00.852 --> 42:03.218
You told everyone what we did.

42:08.317 --> 42:10.182
What "we" did?

42:12.238 --> 42:14.103
I didn't do anything.

42:15.241 --> 42:17.232
You're the one who did it.

42:17.243 --> 42:19.199
You're the one who couldn't
keep your shit together.

42:19.203 --> 42:20.943
I was just trying to help you.

42:20.955 --> 42:22.695
Yeah, well, thanks for all the help.

42:25.126 --> 42:28.664
I told you to walk away,
you wanted to stay.

42:29.839 --> 42:32.125
I would've been a lot better off on my own.

42:35.011 --> 42:39.675
Look, I'm sorry, Linden.
I fucked up, okay?

42:40.266 --> 42:43.554
I just felt like the whole world
was coming crashing down on me

42:43.561 --> 42:45.552
and I was about to explode.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.975
Yeah, well, I was wrong about you.

42:48.858 --> 42:51.349
You're just a fucking
junkie like the rest of them.

42:54.155 --> 42:56.692
Some kind of father you're gonna be.

42:58.576 --> 43:01.033
How's Jack doing, by the way?

43:01.037 --> 43:04.245
Weren't you supposed to take
him to the airport right now?

43:05.249 --> 43:07.501
- Shit.
- Oh, snap, classic Linden,

43:07.502 --> 43:10.960
not giving a shit about anyone who's
still alive, not even your own son.

43:12.340 --> 43:13.876
I'm the one who's fucked up?

43:13.883 --> 43:16.124
The only people you care about are dead.

43:18.012 --> 43:20.173
- Tell the little man I said adios.
- Fuck you!

43:20.181 --> 43:22.342
Yeah, fuck you too.

43:30.858 --> 43:32.769
Passenger
loading and unloading only.

43:32.777 --> 43:34.608
You got everything?

43:36.447 --> 43:38.984
You don't have to worry about me, okay?

43:40.368 --> 43:41.699
What's going on, Mom?

43:42.411 --> 43:44.993
- Nothing.
- Yeah, okay, whatever.

43:44.997 --> 43:46.612
- Jack, wait.
- I'm gonna miss my plane.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.205
Just wait. Just stop.

43:50.211 --> 43:52.167
Just look at me.

43:52.171 --> 43:57.040
I'm just not great at this,
being a mom.

43:59.387 --> 44:02.379
I was just a kid myself, I wasn't
that much older than you

44:02.390 --> 44:04.221
when I had you,

44:04.225 --> 44:06.682
and I had nobody to show me how.

44:11.816 --> 44:14.523
I don't want you to worry about me.

44:17.446 --> 44:20.859
I want you to get on that plane,

44:22.827 --> 44:25.409
and go back home.

44:29.250 --> 44:31.286
And I want

44:32.295 --> 44:35.207
for you to grab every piece of life,

44:35.214 --> 44:39.583
every piece of it, never let go.

44:39.594 --> 44:41.676
And...

44:42.513 --> 44:45.300
And never be ashamed of anything.

44:47.101 --> 44:49.968
Because no matter what happens to me,

44:49.979 --> 44:54.018
you were always my best thing.

44:55.109 --> 44:57.851
You're my best thing, Jack.

45:11.375 --> 45:12.751
I'll see you summer break?

45:13.502 --> 45:14.878
Yeah.

46:35.710 --> 46:37.120
Where is he?

46:39.422 --> 46:41.788
Where is he? Where is he?

46:48.306 --> 46:50.217
Where is he?

46:54.395 --> 46:56.226
Where is he?

47:26.344 --> 47:28.175
We need to talk.

47:28.179 --> 47:30.044
I don't got time.

47:30.056 --> 47:32.047
I know about Skinner.

47:35.811 --> 47:38.598
I know what you and Linden did to him.

47:39.648 --> 47:41.604
I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

47:41.609 --> 47:44.772
I got both your phones
traced to the lake that night.

47:46.530 --> 47:48.066
That don't mean shit.

47:49.533 --> 47:51.865
I'm trying to help you, Holder.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.235
Don't be stupid.

47:55.122 --> 47:56.453
The only reason we dredged the lake

47:56.457 --> 47:59.665
is because Skinner's
wife saw Linden out there.

48:01.545 --> 48:04.036
She was tossing something into the water.

48:09.512 --> 48:12.879
You know, killers get caught,

48:12.890 --> 48:14.972
because they do something stupid.

48:19.438 --> 48:21.815
Like return to the crime scene.

48:21.816 --> 48:25.024
Linden is bringing you down, man.

48:25.027 --> 48:27.188
You got a kid on the way.

48:27.196 --> 48:29.778
You got a family to think about.

48:30.408 --> 48:32.740
You want to tell your side of the story?

48:34.829 --> 48:37.115
Just go on the record.

48:37.873 --> 48:40.740
Tell me what really happened that night.

48:43.838 --> 48:45.749
I can help you.

48:46.715 --> 48:50.299
I can help you cut a deal, man. Holder.

48:51.470 --> 48:53.051
Holder.

48:56.809 --> 49:00.267
I'm going to the deputy com tomorrow
morning and I'm telling him everything.

49:02.898 --> 49:05.105
So this is your chance

49:05.109 --> 49:07.816
to dig yourself out of your grave.

49:08.863 --> 49:12.447
Protect your kid, your family.

49:19.415 --> 49:21.030
Call me.

50:23.103 --> 50:24.388
Strip, ladies.

50:39.161 --> 50:41.197
What are you waiting for, cadet?

50:52.716 --> 50:54.331
Kyle?

50:55.636 --> 50:57.547
You're such a fucking idiot.

51:05.604 --> 51:07.469
Get his pants.

51:23.163 --> 51:26.246
Your little bitch-ass
wanted to know what happened?

51:30.963 --> 51:32.373
Does that bring anything back?

51:34.675 --> 51:36.586
Don't play dumb.

51:37.511 --> 51:39.467
We know you know what we're talking about.

51:43.142 --> 51:45.224
What? Did you think you
were gonna get a free pass?

51:46.353 --> 51:48.730
That we were just gonna forget about you?

51:50.274 --> 51:54.187
You still haven't shown your slut
mother how much it is that you love her.

51:57.239 --> 52:01.278
Well, come on, little buddy,
get nice and hard for Mommy.

52:03.412 --> 52:04.822
Starting to remember now?

52:08.709 --> 52:11.371
We have a Family Day
tradition in this battalion.

52:11.378 --> 52:15.542
A "wel-cumming" ritual for
all our first-year cadets.

52:17.509 --> 52:22.594
Your mother sent you to us
because she loves you.

52:23.432 --> 52:28.472
She wants us to turn her
little boy into a man.

52:30.147 --> 52:32.354
Well, men in this battalion
must love their mothers.

52:32.358 --> 52:33.814
Yes.

52:33.817 --> 52:38.277
And you're not a man in this
battalion until you prove that to us.

52:39.823 --> 52:42.314
Show Mommy how much you love her

52:42.326 --> 52:46.365
and cum all over her pretty little face.

52:50.376 --> 52:52.162
What, are you some kind of faggot, cadet?

52:55.714 --> 52:57.329
Cadets, you all love your mothers, right?

52:57.341 --> 52:58.626
Yes, sir!

52:58.634 --> 53:01.171
We all love our mothers.

53:04.264 --> 53:06.596
You want to be one of us, don't you, Kyle?

53:09.645 --> 53:11.055
Go on.

53:14.650 --> 53:18.142
- Go on.
- There we go.

53:19.238 --> 53:21.479
- Attaboy.
- There we go.

53:21.490 --> 53:24.072
Make Mommy proud.

53:25.452 --> 53:27.192
There we go.

53:28.706 --> 53:31.197
If you think your life is
tough now, if you don't do this,

53:31.208 --> 53:34.575
your life here is gonna
be more of a living hell.

53:37.506 --> 53:40.589
Now, do it, you little fucking pussy.

53:40.592 --> 53:43.334
Cum all over that bitch's face.

53:43.345 --> 53:46.587
Fuck that bitch. Fuck her.

53:46.598 --> 53:50.341
Fucking kill her. Kill that bitch.

53:50.352 --> 53:52.559
- Kill her!
- Kill her.

53:52.604 --> 53:56.847
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

54:06.660 --> 54:08.321
You did this to me that night.

54:10.581 --> 54:13.288
You did this to me the
night my family was killed.

54:15.085 --> 54:16.950
Did you kill my mom?

54:17.546 --> 54:18.956
What the fuck?

54:18.964 --> 54:21.296
- Did you kill my family?
- What the fuck's he talking about?

54:21.300 --> 54:23.586
I don't know. He's crazy.
His brain's shot up and shit.

54:23.594 --> 54:26.131
It's post-traumatic
stress bullshit...

54:26.138 --> 54:27.298
- Hey! Hey!
- What the...?

54:28.640 --> 54:30.505
- Hey! Hey!
- Let him go.

54:30.517 --> 54:32.553
Fucking freak.

54:51.580 --> 54:53.320
- Please, help me. They're after me.
- Kyle.

54:53.332 --> 54:55.163
AJ and Lincoln and them, they're after me.

54:55.167 --> 54:57.249
They took me to the
latrines and they made me...

54:57.252 --> 55:00.369
Easy, easy, easy, just slow down.

55:00.380 --> 55:02.120
I remember. That night.

55:02.132 --> 55:05.124
- You remember what happened that night?
- I was in the latrines, on my knees...

55:05.135 --> 55:07.046
Oh, God. I don't wanna remember.

55:07.054 --> 55:09.796
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

55:09.807 --> 55:11.468
Everything's gonna be all right.

55:11.475 --> 55:14.342
You're safe now, okay?
Just breathe, breathe.

55:14.353 --> 55:16.344
Just take a breath.
All right? That's better.

55:16.396 --> 55:18.387
I'm gonna get you some water.

55:18.398 --> 55:20.354
Just keep breathing.

56:17.165 --> 56:18.871
Kyle.

56:21.003 --> 56:22.539
It's not what you think.

56:24.798 --> 56:26.538
Please.

56:28.760 --> 56:31.092
- You need to believe me.
- Stay away from me.

56:35.392 --> 56:36.757
Kyle.

56:36.768 --> 56:39.475
You knew? You lied to me?

56:39.521 --> 56:43.309
- You were always lying?
- No. No.

56:43.317 --> 56:45.399
No, I've been protecting you.

56:45.402 --> 56:47.984
Only doing what is best for you.

56:47.988 --> 56:51.697
And you need to believe me.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.236
Stay away from me!

56:59.583 --> 57:01.198
Kyle.

57:02.085 --> 57:05.168
I just want to help you.

57:05.756 --> 57:07.747
Please trust me.

57:11.595 --> 57:13.301
Kyle.

57:14.181 --> 57:15.421
Kyle.

57:16.475 --> 57:17.715
It's okay.

57:19.811 --> 57:21.267
Just let me take the gun.

57:27.027 --> 57:31.737
It's gonna be okay.
Please, it's gonna be okay.

57:38.455 --> 57:42.323
I would never

57:43.126 --> 57:45.503
let anyone hurt you.

57:49.341 --> 57:53.175
Kyle! Kyle, don't go. Don't go.
Listen to me. Come back, please.

57:54.429 --> 57:56.135
Kyle!
