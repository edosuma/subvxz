<i>Everything was delicious, sweetie.</i>

00:29.160 --> 00:33.112
Thanks, baby.
So, how was work?

00:33.198 --> 00:38.251
Slow and painful.
Same as always.

00:40.338 --> 00:44.874
Except for when I got
promoted to shift supervisor.

00:44.959 --> 00:46.926
I knew it.

00:50.181 --> 00:52.215
We need to celebrate.

00:54.719 --> 00:59.472
- Do you have anything in mind?
- As a matter of fact...

01:01.309 --> 01:03.976
Go on, get things started.
I'll clean up in here.

01:04.111 --> 01:07.814
- You sure?
- Of course, baby.

04:04.709 --> 04:09.328
- Easy.
- You're welcome for saving your life.

04:09.414 --> 04:11.747
Only after I saved yours.

04:22.977 --> 04:26.562
- What?
- What are you doing here?

04:26.681 --> 04:28.481
I'm trying to help you.

04:28.566 --> 04:31.150
No, that's not what I mean.

04:32.820 --> 04:37.773
- What are you doing?
- What I have to.

04:37.859 --> 04:42.612
No... that's bullshit.

04:48.002 --> 04:50.002
No, you don't do what I do.

04:50.088 --> 04:54.507
<i>You can leave.
There's a whole world out there.</i>

04:57.879 --> 05:02.682
The life that you're choosing,
it ends one way.

05:02.767 --> 05:07.803
Maybe.
But at least it's my choice.

05:13.311 --> 05:14.727
Jesus Christ.

05:26.574 --> 05:30.326
I need you to leave.
I need you to go.

05:31.462 --> 05:33.379
- No.
- Get out of...

05:36.167 --> 05:37.917
Don't.

06:22.130 --> 06:25.014
<i>Did you know that
Rebecca Bowman was pregnant?</i>

06:26.801 --> 06:28.634
You've asked me that
three times already.

06:28.770 --> 06:32.605
And I'm gonna keep asking
it till I'm satisfied.

06:35.276 --> 06:36.609
Did you know?

06:39.731 --> 06:41.731
No.

06:44.152 --> 06:46.736
Tell me about your
relationship with Rebecca.

06:46.821 --> 06:49.705
- It wasn't a relationship.
- Then what was it?

06:49.824 --> 06:52.241
Like just friends with benefits
or something until you killed her?

06:52.326 --> 06:54.660
- Fuck you, Brock.
- No, fuck you.

06:56.464 --> 06:59.415
Look, I don't think
you're killing young girls.

07:00.802 --> 07:03.002
But I don't know that you're not.

07:03.087 --> 07:05.839
The only thing I know is
you've been lying to me

07:05.840 --> 07:08.591
since you got to Banshee.
And the lies end here.

07:08.676 --> 07:11.343
<i>When was the last
time you saw her alive?</i>

07:11.429 --> 07:13.179
I don't know.
A while ago.

07:13.314 --> 07:14.680
I need you to be more
specific than that.

07:14.816 --> 07:16.515
I don't keep a fucking diary.

07:16.601 --> 07:19.402
Her car's GPS proves she was at
your cabin the night she was killed.

07:22.824 --> 07:24.690
- Like I told you, I didn't see her.
- Really?

07:24.776 --> 07:26.692
How do you know? I mean, you
don't keep a fucking diary.

07:31.916 --> 07:33.749
I think you did see her that night.

07:33.868 --> 07:38.188
I think she told you she was pregnant.
Knowing you, you probably

07:38.189 --> 07:40.289
didn't take that news too well,
so you argued.

07:40.374 --> 07:43.709
- Maybe it turned violent, physical.
- No.

07:45.129 --> 07:47.296
Why is your blood in her car?

07:47.381 --> 07:49.098
I don't know.
Why don't you ask Proctor?

07:49.217 --> 07:51.050
- I'm asking you.
- Well, I don't remember.

07:51.185 --> 07:55.354
Well, do you remember cutting
the hearts out of these two girls?

07:55.440 --> 07:57.106
Jesus Christ.
Come on, you know me, Brock.

07:57.225 --> 07:59.442
No, see, I don't!
I don't know you.

07:59.560 --> 08:03.052
The only thing I know is that you went off
the deep end when Siobhan was killed.

08:03.087 --> 08:05.397
<i>You snapped and maybe
you're reenacting her death</i>

08:05.533 --> 08:07.783
over and over and over
again like some psychotic...

08:07.902 --> 08:11.487
Jesus, open your fucking eyes, Brock!
This didn't happen in the moment.

08:11.572 --> 08:17.993
Whoever did this shit
took time to plan it! Think!

08:18.079 --> 08:21.997
What, you think I got
them pregnant as well? Huh?

08:22.083 --> 08:25.501
- You fucking know it wasn't me.
- I don't know anything!

08:25.586 --> 08:28.454
Yeah, well, that about sums it up.

08:35.563 --> 08:39.097
Ted, Sheryl, and Martin.
How y'all doing this morning?

08:39.232 --> 08:41.267
<i>Have a seat, Mr. Watts.</i>

08:44.105 --> 08:46.772
<i>State your name for the record.</i>

08:46.908 --> 08:48.440
Randall Cody Watts.

08:48.576 --> 08:51.494
Good morning, Mr. Watts.
I'm Commissioner Ted Smith.

08:51.612 --> 08:53.829
I'm joined today by
Commissioner Sheryl Golden

08:53.948 --> 08:57.961
<i>- and Commissioner Martin Davis.
- Yeah, we've all met.</i>

08:59.036 --> 09:00.703
Today is your...

09:00.788 --> 09:03.789
sixth appearance before
this board of parole.

09:03.925 --> 09:05.958
If you say so, Teddy.
I've lost count.

09:06.043 --> 09:09.879
- Sheryl, I see you finally had that baby.
- I did.

09:09.964 --> 09:12.431
I hope you and Mr. Golden
picked out a nice Anglo name.

09:12.517 --> 09:14.600
<i>Mr. Watts, I suggest you
take this hearing seriously.</i>

09:14.685 --> 09:16.051
What about the kike sitting next to you?

09:16.137 --> 09:17.636
You think she's taking this seriously?

09:17.722 --> 09:19.054
<i>- Mr. Watts!
- Shut the fuck up, Martin.</i>

09:19.140 --> 09:20.973
<i>- Mr. Watts.
- We all know the drill.</i>

09:21.058 --> 09:23.434
You're going to deny
my parole, then go home

09:23.435 --> 09:25.811
congratulating yourselves on
making the world a safer place.

09:25.897 --> 09:29.107
But what you minimum wage
pencil dicks can't possibly

09:29.108 --> 09:32.318
understand is that however
repulsive you seem to think I am,

09:32.453 --> 09:34.820
that the darkness
swallowing this country whole

09:34.906 --> 09:36.739
and coming for you and
your half-breed families

09:36.824 --> 09:38.908
is a million fucking times worse.

09:38.993 --> 09:40.993
We're done here, Mr. Watts.

09:41.128 --> 09:43.212
Go fuck yourself, Ted.

09:46.751 --> 09:48.717
Oh, and, Sheryl...

09:48.836 --> 09:52.721
you be sure to give little Shoshanna
Golden a big kiss from her Aryan uncle

09:52.840 --> 09:56.399
'cause you know I'm gonna
be thinking about her.

10:09.574 --> 10:11.991
<i>The pain is only psychological.</i>

11:13.587 --> 11:16.255
Sheriff's giving you five minutes.

11:25.299 --> 11:28.083
You finally get to
visit me in jail, huh?

11:30.438 --> 11:33.247
Better late than never.

11:36.610 --> 11:39.828
- I didn't do this.
- I know.

11:41.615 --> 11:46.785
<i>- Do you have any idea who did?
- Not yet.</i>

11:49.006 --> 11:51.040
I don't know if you'll make bail,

11:51.125 --> 11:53.759
but I can use my house
as collateral if you do.

11:55.463 --> 11:57.012
Thanks.

12:04.138 --> 12:05.804
How's Job?

12:09.643 --> 12:11.560
They did a real number on him.

12:14.732 --> 12:18.784
- He'll be okay.
- How about you?

12:24.542 --> 12:27.540
I really need to get
the fuck out of here.

12:55.072 --> 12:57.573
Hello, Ted.

13:03.948 --> 13:09.251
- How is he?
- Innocent and Brock knows it.

13:09.370 --> 13:13.839
Well, the evidence says otherwise
and the sheriff has to follow up.

13:14.842 --> 13:16.508
You got something for me?

13:17.878 --> 13:20.712
I did.
It can wait.

13:20.798 --> 13:23.766
No, I need the distraction.

13:30.775 --> 13:34.977
It's the details of a drug processing
and distribution facility.

13:35.062 --> 13:38.614
- Proctor's?
- Mm-hmm.

13:39.817 --> 13:44.153
- Thank you, Bunker.
- Be careful, Mrs. Hopewell.

14:25.412 --> 14:29.248
- You just made bail.
- I didn't kill her.

14:29.333 --> 14:32.117
Maybe you did, maybe
you didn't. Either way.

14:32.253 --> 14:34.253
What the hell is this?
Get away from there!

14:34.338 --> 14:39.458
- Proctor, what the hell are you doing?
- I posted the prisoner's bail.

14:39.543 --> 14:43.128
- Bail? This is bullshit.
- Hood is coming with me.

14:43.264 --> 14:45.013
- The hell he is.
- Let him in.

14:45.132 --> 14:46.584
- No.
- Get out of my way, Brock!

14:46.619 --> 14:48.267
- Not gonna happen.
- I'm the fucking mayor!

14:48.352 --> 14:52.020
- And I'm the fucking sheriff!
- Get out of the fucking way.

14:53.107 --> 14:55.524
You give me those keys
or I will shoot you.

15:01.398 --> 15:05.984
Wow.
Everybody is so angry.

15:06.070 --> 15:08.820
- Ma'am, you cannot be back here.
- Why not? Everybody else is.

15:08.906 --> 15:11.990
- Bunker, take this woman up front, please.
- Stay put, Bunker.

15:12.076 --> 15:16.578
Special Agent Veronica Dawson.
Violent Crimes.

15:18.215 --> 15:21.667
Yeah, that always seems to suck
the air right out of the room.

15:21.802 --> 15:25.254
I take it you're Sheriff Lotus.

15:25.339 --> 15:29.007
- And you are?
- Kai Proctor.

15:29.143 --> 15:32.928
Mr. Proctor, I am truly
sorry for your loss.

15:33.013 --> 15:34.596
Let's go, Proctor.

15:34.682 --> 15:36.315
- I got this.
- Get your fucking hands off me!

15:36.400 --> 15:40.018
I got this, Sheriff.
Mr. Proctor, I can only imagine

15:40.154 --> 15:43.021
how frustrated you must be with
how things have been handled.

15:43.107 --> 15:45.524
But this is my investigation now

15:45.609 --> 15:48.327
and while I've got a little
bit of lost time to make up for,

15:48.412 --> 15:50.329
I can assure you I'm a quick study

15:50.414 --> 15:52.447
and I plan to get to
the bottom of things.

15:52.533 --> 15:56.668
Do me a favor, give me some time
to sort things through,

15:56.754 --> 16:00.422
and as soon as I do,
you'll be the first to know.

16:03.928 --> 16:06.878
You have 24 hours.

16:07.264 --> 16:09.935
Then what happens?

16:30.070 --> 16:32.904
What a fun group.

16:51.925 --> 16:54.226
Shh.

17:03.771 --> 17:05.569
Do you think she's pretty?

17:07.608 --> 17:09.941
I think he'll be happy.

18:12.756 --> 18:16.876
Lucas Hood.
Onetime sheriff.

18:16.877 --> 18:19.478
<i>Part-time mountain man.</i>

18:19.563 --> 18:23.014
<i>And now the primary
suspect in three homicides.</i>

18:23.100 --> 18:24.933
<i>It's a hell of a résumé.</i>

18:28.772 --> 18:31.523
<i>Sheriff Lotus told me
you don't talk much.</i>

18:33.277 --> 18:36.995
<i>Well, maybe I just
don't talk to him much.</i>

18:38.532 --> 18:41.917
He also told me about Deputy Kelly.

18:42.035 --> 18:46.588
You two were a couple
at the time of her death?

18:46.707 --> 18:51.543
<i>God, losing a deputy and
a lover in one fell swoop.</i>

18:51.678 --> 18:54.129
<i>That must have been tough.</i>

18:54.214 --> 18:57.748
I've been there.

18:58.936 --> 19:01.770
My husband Paul.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.724
He was leading a tactical operation.

19:05.859 --> 19:07.809
Some low-level terrorist
we could lean on

19:07.895 --> 19:11.563
to get us some bigger fish.
By the book, breach and arrest.

19:11.698 --> 19:14.675
He had the perp facedown
and zip-tied when in walks

19:14.676 --> 19:17.652
the guy's 13-year-old
nephew holding a Glock 9.

19:17.738 --> 19:20.989
Paul could have dropped
him in a heartbeat.

19:21.074 --> 19:24.125
I mean, who can't outshoot a kid, right?

19:25.462 --> 19:28.580
But instead he tried to talk him down.

19:28.715 --> 19:31.800
I guess that kid didn't
feel like talking.

19:33.754 --> 19:38.306
He shot Paul in the neck.
Killed him instantly.

19:45.816 --> 19:49.935
- You've been doing this a while.
- Long enough.

19:50.020 --> 19:52.687
Long enough to know that
the fake husband story

19:52.773 --> 19:55.490
is not gonna work on someone like me.

19:58.162 --> 20:03.198
So either you think I'm an idiot
or you wanted me to call you on it.

20:05.252 --> 20:08.170
What, so that I would
feel like I'm in control?

20:09.756 --> 20:11.706
<i>Seeing as we both know that's not true,</i>

20:11.792 --> 20:15.760
why don't you cut the bullshit
and ask me what you want to ask?

20:17.181 --> 20:19.047
Okay.

20:20.517 --> 20:22.968
Did you kill Rebecca Bowman?

20:24.471 --> 20:27.389
- No.
- Well, that was easy.

20:27.474 --> 20:29.891
<i>I so appreciate your
cooperation, Mr. Hood.</i>

20:29.977 --> 20:32.811
- You're welcome.
- I'm sure we'll meet again.

20:34.948 --> 20:38.116
I'm guessing you don't have
a lot of pals down at the bureau.

20:38.202 --> 20:42.737
- You know a lot about the FBI, do you?
- No, not really.

20:42.823 --> 20:46.524
But I know a little something
about burnouts.

20:48.879 --> 20:52.414
Yeah, I'll bet you do.

21:00.257 --> 21:02.140
He didn't do it.

21:02.226 --> 21:04.643
Really? You decided
that in five minutes?

21:04.728 --> 21:07.012
No, I decided that in about two.

21:07.097 --> 21:11.483
- The evidence...
- The evidence is shit and you know it.

21:11.568 --> 21:16.505
The evidence isn't shit.
It's circumstantial.

21:20.027 --> 21:21.860
I'll cut him loose.

21:21.995 --> 21:24.362
- Not yet.
- Why?

21:24.498 --> 21:26.665
Because the minute we release him,

21:26.750 --> 21:29.167
Hood's gonna try to find
Bowman's killer on his own.

21:29.253 --> 21:32.087
And I'd like
a little bit of a head start.

21:36.176 --> 21:37.676
For the record,

21:37.761 --> 21:40.545
I also knew that your
husband story was bullshit.

21:40.631 --> 21:41.880
Mmm...

22:21.254 --> 22:24.131
Did you know that Proctor
was in the drug business

22:24.132 --> 22:27.008
- with your old crew?
- What are you talking about?

22:28.395 --> 22:32.147
There are neo-Nazis crawling
all over his warehouse.

22:32.265 --> 22:34.232
How do you know that?

22:34.318 --> 22:36.017
<i>I'm looking at them right now.</i>

22:36.103 --> 22:38.486
Kurt, did you know?

22:38.605 --> 22:41.106
If I knew, I would have
said something to you.

22:41.191 --> 22:44.492
Look, we need to take a step
back and figure things out.

22:44.611 --> 22:46.728
This changes things.

22:47.614 --> 22:49.247
Not for me, it doesn't.

22:49.333 --> 22:53.118
<i>Carrie.
Carr...</i>

23:26.821 --> 23:28.821
_

23:28.822 --> 23:30.205
Why didn't you tell me?

23:30.323 --> 23:33.708
I wanted the new
facility to be a surprise.

23:34.828 --> 23:36.211
When will it be operational?

23:36.329 --> 23:39.080
The end of this week,
maybe a little sooner.

23:39.166 --> 23:42.333
We can run double shifts, triple
the output in the first month.

23:42.469 --> 23:44.085
I'll hire a new
foreman to oversee...

23:44.171 --> 23:47.806
Rebecca, the Brotherhood will
be managing this operation.

23:48.892 --> 23:50.508
What?

23:50.644 --> 23:51.976
<i>- Yeah.
- Why?</i>

23:52.062 --> 23:55.930
They can provide the distance
and the insulation I require as mayor.

23:56.016 --> 23:58.433
- This should be mine.
- No, I know.

23:58.518 --> 23:59.818
But you have to trust me on this.

23:59.903 --> 24:01.853
I have something much
bigger planned for you.

24:01.938 --> 24:04.022
Yes, your big plan.

24:04.157 --> 24:05.440
Meanwhile nothing is happening

24:05.525 --> 24:07.409
and you're handing over
our business to Nazis?

24:07.527 --> 24:09.904
I know that's how it looks to you,
but I promise this

24:09.905 --> 24:12.864
- is what's best for us.
- No, this is what's best for you.

24:12.999 --> 24:16.117
<i>And that's all you've
ever really cared about.</i>

24:16.203 --> 24:18.503
I wish you'd stop
treating me like a child.

24:18.588 --> 24:21.771
I will when you stop acting like one.

24:22.592 --> 24:24.709
When you were my age, you
were already running things.

24:24.795 --> 24:26.127
There was no one holding you back.

24:26.213 --> 24:27.846
There was no one protecting me either.

24:27.931 --> 24:30.715
- I don't need your protection!
- Yes, you do!

24:30.801 --> 24:35.169
<i>- This is a dangerous business.
- I'm fucking dangerous!</i>

24:37.390 --> 24:40.358
You have no idea how dangerous I am.

24:48.735 --> 24:51.736
<i>Grandma means well, honey.</i>

24:51.872 --> 24:55.957
<i>I think she's just worried about you.</i>

24:56.076 --> 24:58.493
<i>You're just gonna have
to give her a chance.</i>

25:02.048 --> 25:04.415
Well, could you at
least pretend for Max?

25:07.337 --> 25:10.305
'Cause I need you to set
a good example, that's why.

25:17.931 --> 25:19.564
Honey, hold on.

25:21.101 --> 25:22.400
Job?

25:26.656 --> 25:28.857
Deva, I'm gonna call you right back.

26:01.441 --> 26:04.225
- Fuck, Job!
- Fuck!

26:04.311 --> 26:05.693
I almost shot you!

26:07.781 --> 26:09.948
Imagine my fucking relief.

26:10.033 --> 26:11.733
You shouldn't even be out of bed.

26:11.818 --> 26:15.153
And you shouldn't be storing
your AKs next to your Ann Taylor.

26:16.373 --> 26:20.191
- How'd you get in there?
- It's a motherfucking tumbler.

26:24.965 --> 26:27.966
You got enough firepower
in here to start a war.

26:30.220 --> 26:34.255
Not start one.
Just finish it.

27:13.546 --> 27:17.548
Amen.
Evil from us deliver but...

27:17.634 --> 27:19.767
<i>...us against trespass...</i>

27:19.886 --> 27:23.221
...who those forgive us as...

27:23.356 --> 27:26.140
<i>...heaven in is it as Earth on...</i>

27:28.144 --> 27:30.361
...name thy be hallowed...

27:30.447 --> 27:32.814
<i>...heaven in art who...</i>

27:32.899 --> 27:35.700
...Father our.

27:54.087 --> 27:55.637
Hot date?

27:57.390 --> 27:58.640
You should really get some sleep.

27:58.758 --> 28:00.975
That would require me
closing my eyes.

28:02.429 --> 28:05.313
It's gonna take time, Job.

28:08.852 --> 28:12.437
- Fuck this. I'm coming with you.
- That's a bad idea.

28:12.522 --> 28:15.306
No, it's the worst
motherfucking idea ever.

28:16.943 --> 28:18.493
You're not coming.

28:18.611 --> 28:21.362
Not you or nobody get to tell me
what to do anymore.

28:21.448 --> 28:23.781
You are not leaving me in
this motherfucking house alone.

28:23.917 --> 28:25.783
Just don't...
don't...

28:25.869 --> 28:30.338
don't... leave... me.

28:34.427 --> 28:35.927
You're staying in the car.

28:37.514 --> 28:39.380
You're gonna need someone
to watch your back.

28:39.466 --> 28:42.183
- You're gonna need somebody...
- I'm serious.

28:44.304 --> 28:45.970
Fine.

28:53.613 --> 28:56.030
Got your message.
What happened?

29:01.154 --> 29:03.204
- Have a drink.
- Come on, man.

29:03.323 --> 29:05.707
I dropped everything 'cause I
thought you were in trouble here.

29:05.825 --> 29:08.376
Shit, I need to get back to Proctor's...

29:08.495 --> 29:10.294
Fuck Proctor.

29:10.380 --> 29:14.799
Now sit down and show
me some goddamn respect.

29:29.315 --> 29:33.735
No, no, don't be a fucking pussy.
Okay?

29:34.904 --> 29:36.738
There you go.

29:38.324 --> 29:40.108
Drink.

29:50.036 --> 29:52.286
You all right, man?

29:55.759 --> 30:00.311
Watts should have never
made a deal with Proctor.

30:01.131 --> 30:06.717
He's so busy
chasing his own retirement plan

30:06.803 --> 30:10.021
that he's abandoned

30:10.106 --> 30:13.858
everything that we've been
fighting for all these years.

30:16.229 --> 30:21.032
He may be blinded by Proctor's money,

30:21.117 --> 30:22.984
but I'm not.

30:24.621 --> 30:26.788
And I'm not gonna keep
my mouth shut anymore.

30:26.906 --> 30:29.073
Calvin, you're drunk, buddy.

30:29.159 --> 30:32.376
- Whatever you're thinking...
- No. No.

30:32.462 --> 30:34.745
I'm done thinking, Joe.

30:36.800 --> 30:40.251
I'm done being Watts' bitch.

30:42.639 --> 30:47.035
It's time for me to man the fuck up.

30:53.983 --> 30:56.350
Watts has to fucking go.

31:14.087 --> 31:16.838
<i>We've been at this for months, Job.</i>

31:16.956 --> 31:18.789
<i>You must be getting tired.</i>

31:18.925 --> 31:21.292
<i>Let's change the mood, shall we?</i>

31:27.851 --> 31:29.217
<i>Job.</i>

31:30.854 --> 31:32.637
<i>Job. Job.</i>

31:35.475 --> 31:40.027
- You okay?
- I'm fine. How about you?

31:40.146 --> 31:43.481
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look fucking fine.

31:43.616 --> 31:44.815
Not now.

31:44.951 --> 31:49.904
Just in case I do have
to drive home alone,

31:49.989 --> 31:52.523
you want to tell me what
this is really about?

31:53.660 --> 31:57.995
Why are you doing this?
Hmm?

32:04.420 --> 32:07.271
Do you think all this...

32:07.272 --> 32:11.142
Catwoman bullshit is
what he would have wanted?

32:13.179 --> 32:14.845
Stay in the car.

32:30.196 --> 32:34.782
<i>- Hey, what did he say?
- He said you're gonna die.</i>

32:34.867 --> 32:39.620
Oh, what the hell is this?
Hey, this is private property.

32:39.706 --> 32:42.540
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>

32:42.625 --> 32:44.375
<i>I asked you a question.</i>

32:44.460 --> 32:47.261
Are you deaf, you stupid bitch?

32:47.380 --> 32:50.264
No, I hear you loud and clear...

32:52.185 --> 32:55.636
- ...bitch.
- Shit!

34:44.496 --> 34:46.130
Come on back, bitch.
Come on.

35:06.018 --> 35:07.234
Come on.

35:27.707 --> 35:30.791
Bitch... bitch, move.
Move!

35:30.877 --> 35:32.309
Run!

35:47.810 --> 35:52.146
- So how'd that go?
- Like clockwork.

35:58.037 --> 36:01.572
<i>Unlock gate 13.</i>

36:09.749 --> 36:11.665
See you again real soon there, convict.

36:11.751 --> 36:14.552
And you fuck your mama, Larry.

36:23.980 --> 36:25.980
You my ride?

36:26.098 --> 36:29.266
Nice car. Them Krauts
always done it best.

36:29.352 --> 36:31.268
We headed to Banshee?

36:31.354 --> 36:34.071
Mr. Proctor would like to see
you at your earliest convenience.

36:34.157 --> 36:35.906
Well, then what the
hell are we waiting for?

37:01.634 --> 37:03.968
- Fuck.
- FBI, skeezy fuckers.

37:05.304 --> 37:07.137
Put the pipe down.

37:07.273 --> 37:11.308
What are you doing?
Get the fuck out of here. Go.

38:35.895 --> 38:37.728
Dawson.

38:38.948 --> 38:42.060
On my way.

38:50.159 --> 38:53.327
Raven, this is Agent
Dawson from the FBI.

38:53.412 --> 38:56.463
- Yeah, what do we got?
- Coroner estimated she was killed

38:56.582 --> 39:00.718
9 or 10 hours ago
based on body temp and lividity.

39:00.803 --> 39:03.087
- MO is the same?
- Yeah.

39:03.222 --> 39:07.841
- Attractive female, 18-24.
- Son of a bitch cut her heart out, too.

39:21.273 --> 39:24.158
Cut isn't surgical, but it is precise.

39:24.276 --> 39:29.279
He's in a safe place when he does this.
Takes his time.

39:29.365 --> 39:31.415
Defensive wounds?

39:31.500 --> 39:35.285
Ligature marks,
just like the other victims.

39:35.421 --> 39:39.039
She was tied up. Some kind
of rope, heavy braiding.

39:39.125 --> 39:42.292
- Enough to bruise like this?
- She was bound for a while.

39:42.378 --> 39:44.178
He doesn't kill them right away.

39:44.296 --> 39:46.597
No signs of sexual abuse.

39:47.800 --> 39:50.100
No, he doesn't see them sexually.

39:52.638 --> 39:55.356
Right here. He drugged her.

39:55.474 --> 39:59.143
Just like the others.
Butchered her alive.

40:01.947 --> 40:05.399
- Got an ID?
- No, nothing yet.

40:05.484 --> 40:07.034
<i>What'd the witness say?</i>

40:07.153 --> 40:08.902
<i>Caught a glimpse of
someone dragging the body</i>

40:08.988 --> 40:10.821
into the woods just after 5:00 A.M.

40:10.956 --> 40:13.907
And why the hell did they
wait four hours to call it in?

40:13.993 --> 40:17.410
Because his mommy thought
he was making it up.

40:18.497 --> 40:20.581
What's the kid's name?

40:22.168 --> 40:24.885
<i>- Tocho.
- Tocho.</i>

40:25.004 --> 40:26.887
Let's cover her up.

40:27.006 --> 40:30.340
<i>- Make sure the coroner gets all those notes, yeah?
- Are you Tocho?</i>

40:30.476 --> 40:32.009
Is that you?

40:32.144 --> 40:37.431
Can you... Can you tell
me what you saw? Hmm?

40:37.516 --> 40:40.434
Was it a man or a woman, huh?

40:40.519 --> 40:43.437
- Young or old?
- Come on, that's enough.

40:43.522 --> 40:46.607
<i>No more questions, huh?
Come on, Tocho.</i>

40:53.499 --> 40:56.116
Okay, I'm gonna finish
cutting this for you

40:56.202 --> 40:57.751
<i>and you're gonna eat all of it.</i>

40:57.870 --> 41:00.504
<i>- And then treats.
- Okay.</i>

41:00.589 --> 41:02.790
<i>But the vegetables, too.</i>

41:02.875 --> 41:04.341
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

41:04.427 --> 41:06.126
<i>- Promise?
- Yeah.</i>

41:06.212 --> 41:08.846
How are the potatoes?

41:10.933 --> 41:16.303
- Dry?
- I'm sorry. I must have overcooked them.

41:35.207 --> 41:36.623
Stay here.

41:45.918 --> 41:49.219
- What the fuck?
- It's nice to see you, too, Calvin.

41:49.305 --> 41:52.205
And, yes, I'd love to come inside.

41:53.926 --> 41:58.562
- Do I smell Magpie's cooking?
- How did you get out?

41:58.647 --> 42:00.397
It's a hell of a story.

42:00.483 --> 42:03.600
- Oh?
- Maybe I'll tell it to you sometime.

42:03.736 --> 42:05.635
Daddy.

42:08.774 --> 42:10.991
- You're out?
- Good news, baby.

42:11.110 --> 42:13.243
I've been rehabilitated.

42:14.446 --> 42:16.330
Mwah.

42:17.750 --> 42:21.869
And who might you be?

42:23.339 --> 42:26.540
Uh, Hank, this is your grandfather.

42:26.625 --> 42:30.344
You just call me Papa, sweetheart.

42:36.719 --> 42:40.103
Uh, okay, we're gonna go
up and take a bath now.

43:05.247 --> 43:08.248
You know what?
Fuck a man's heart.

43:09.835 --> 43:14.121
You want love,
go right to his stomach.

43:35.494 --> 43:40.147
Congratulations.
You're not a serial killer.

43:51.594 --> 43:54.127
I'll need you to fill
out some paperwork.

44:38.913 --> 44:42.850
_

45:52.715 --> 45:55.415
<i>Need a ride?</i>

45:55.501 --> 45:58.752
You don't seem like the
type to hold a grudge.

45:59.838 --> 46:03.090
- You kept me locked up.
- I just got here.

46:03.175 --> 46:07.060
- Had to get my bearings.
- I'm glad I could help.

46:12.518 --> 46:16.269
- You knew I was innocent.
- I think innocent

46:16.355 --> 46:18.488
might be a bit of a stretch, don't you?

46:18.574 --> 46:20.240
Yeah, fuck you.

46:20.359 --> 46:22.943
Hey, you're welcome for
that alibi, by the way.

46:27.499 --> 46:29.282
Look, Hood, I know where you live.

46:29.368 --> 46:32.669
It's a long walk to that cabin of yours.

46:38.577 --> 46:40.761
I need a drink.

46:40.879 --> 46:43.680
You definitely need a drink.
