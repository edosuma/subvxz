      HERE COMES THE HEAT.
           - [sighs]

00:08.009 --> 00:10.209

   - OH, IT'S COMING AT YOU.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.648

00:21.454 --> 00:23.222
              OH!
          YOUR POINT!

00:23.224 --> 00:25.190

   OVER-THE-FENCE HIGH FIVE.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.330
      WE SHOULD GET A DOG.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.232
    - WHO SHOULD GET A DOG?
         - ALL OF US--

00:33.234 --> 00:36.802
      YOU, ME, AND MY MOM.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.437
  - LIFE LESSON COMING AT YOU,
         DEAR MARCUS--

00:38.439 --> 00:40.339
       WHAT WE HAVE HERE
       IS CALLED A FENCE,

00:40.341 --> 00:42.508
         AND IT'S HERE
  BECAUSE WE ARE NOT AN "US."

00:42.510 --> 00:45.244
        YOU AND YOUR MOM
          ARE AN "US."

00:45.246 --> 00:46.779
       I AM JUST A WILL.

00:46.781 --> 00:49.615
 - YOU WOULDN'T BE JUST A WILL
   IF THE FENCE WASN'T THERE.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.350
   - WELL, BARRING A TORNADO,

00:51.352 --> 00:53.185
       WHICH IS UNCOMMON
        IN THIS REGION,

00:53.187 --> 00:56.555
           THIS BABY
 ISN'T EVER COMING DOWN, EVER.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.058
           - IT WILL
     WHEN YOU MARRY MY MOM.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.259
         I MEAN, IF...

01:00.261 --> 01:04.096
      IF YOU MARRY MY MOM.

01:04.098 --> 01:06.265
         - UH, LISTEN,
 I GOT--I--THERE'S SOMEWHERE--

01:06.267 --> 01:07.766
        I-I--THERE'S A--
        I HAVE A THING.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.401
         I HAVE A THING
       THAT'S BEEN VERY--

01:09.403 --> 01:10.469
      I HAVE A WILL THING.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.571
      WHY DON'T WE, UH...
          - BUT WAIT.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.406
     WE'RE NOT DONE PLAYING
          DAD-MINTON.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.743
      I-I MEAN, BADMINTON.
           BADMINTON!

01:17.745 --> 01:20.512
         - HEY, FIONA.
    WE--WE GOT A SITUATION.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.181
       - IS MARCUS OKAY?
            - NOPE.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.515
  HE THINKS THAT I'M GONNA BE
          HIS FATHER.

01:23.517 --> 01:24.716
   - WHY DOES HE THINK THAT?

01:24.718 --> 01:26.285
    - BECAUSE HE'S CONVINCED
         THAT YOU AND I

01:26.287 --> 01:27.753
    ARE GONNA START DATING.
  - I MEAN, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.455
    I WOULD NEVER DATE YOU,
          EVER, EVER.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.290
         - WELL, MARCUS
      DOES NOT KNOW THAT.

01:31.292 --> 01:34.193
        - WELL, I THINK
   I KNOW MY NEIGHBOR, OKAY?

01:34.195 --> 01:36.361
   - OKAY, AND BESIDES THAT,

01:36.363 --> 01:37.863
          MARCUS KNOWS
       THAT I DON'T DATE.

01:37.865 --> 01:40.132
        - UH--EXCUSE ME?
        - OH, I'M SORRY.

01:40.134 --> 01:42.234
   YEAH, I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY
 YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:42.236 --> 01:45.237
I KNOW YOUR LIFE IS A REVOLVING
  DOOR OF SEXUAL INTERLUDES...

01:45.239 --> 01:49.208
      - BUT NORMAL PEOPLE,
    WHEN THEY HAVE CHILDREN,

01:49.210 --> 01:50.676
         THINGS CHANGE.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.212
    YOU TAKE THE SEXUAL PART
          OF YOURSELF,

01:53.214 --> 01:54.680
    AND YOU PUT IT ON PAUSE.

01:54.682 --> 01:58.117
     - AND EXACTLY HOW LONG
      HAVE YOU BEEN ON...

01:58.119 --> 01:59.251
        [British accent]
             PAUSE?

01:59.253 --> 02:01.220
        - WELL, I'M NOT
      GONNA TELL YOU THAT.

02:01.222 --> 02:05.257
  TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ON
SEXUAL PAUSE SINCE MARCUS' DAD.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.126
        FIONA, THE KID--
         THE KID IS 9.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.261
         - HE'S NOT 9.
            HE'S 11.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.363
            WHY CAN
    YOU NEVER REMEMBER THAT?

02:11.365 --> 02:14.333
     - IT'S BEEN 11 YEARS?
     - WELL, OF COURSE NOT.

02:14.335 --> 02:18.871
   MARCUS' FATHER AND I HAVE
A VERY COMPLICATED SEXUAL PAST.

02:18.873 --> 02:20.205
           - OH, MY--
        - AND I DON'T--

02:20.207 --> 02:21.440
  IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

02:21.442 --> 02:25.144
WHEN THAT LITTLE DUDE OUT THERE
    CALLED IT "DAD-MINTON."

02:25.146 --> 02:27.279
    - LOOK, IF HE'S CONFUSED
  ABOUT YOUR ROLE IN HIS LIFE,

02:27.281 --> 02:28.480
         THAT'S ON YOU.
            - WHAT?

02:28.482 --> 02:29.615
        - IF HE SEES YOU
      AS A FATHER FIGURE,

02:29.617 --> 02:30.616
          IT'S 'CAUSE
       YOU ACT LIKE ONE.

02:30.618 --> 02:31.884
         - NO, I DON'T.
        - WELL, YOU DO.

02:31.886 --> 02:33.318
         YOU'RE ALWAYS
  OUT THERE PLAYING WITH HIM,

02:33.320 --> 02:37.256
      AND YOU BUILD FORTS
     WITH MY GOOD PILLOWS.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.258
    YOU DO FATHER-SON THINGS
           TOGETHER.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.527
     - WE DO KID-KID THINGS
           TOGETHER.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.762
   - WELL, HE DOESN'T SEE IT
           LIKE THAT.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.165
       ACTUALLY, THIS IS
      A GOOD CONVERSATION

02:46.167 --> 02:47.432
  THAT WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW

02:47.434 --> 02:50.702
    BECAUSE YOU NEED TO STOP

02:50.704 --> 02:52.838
      ACTING LIKE A FATHER

02:52.840 --> 02:55.807
        AND START ACTING
     MORE LIKE A NEIGHBOR,

02:55.809 --> 02:59.845
   BECAUSE YOUR RELATIONSHIP
 WITH MY SON IS VERY UNHEALTHY.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.849

      YOU SOMETHING, OKAY?

03:03.851 --> 03:07.486
WHAT YOU GUYS GOT GOING ON HERE
  IS A BATES MOTEL SITUATION.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.860
   I GOT TO GO TAKE A SHOWER.
       AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:14.862 --> 03:17.763
 NOW I CAN'T EVEN TAKE A SHOWER
     'CAUSE I'M TOO SCARED.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.298
           LISTEN...

03:19.300 --> 03:21.200
FOR MARCUS' EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING
       AND FOR MY SAFETY,

03:21.202 --> 03:23.535

JUST TEACH HIM HOW TO MAN THE--

        NOT A GOOD IDEA.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.779
           BADMINTON?
         - OH, REALLY--

06:53.781 --> 06:56.748
   - NO, I AM GRILLING, GUYS,
          ALONE HERE.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.049
           - WITH ME.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.584
       HE MEANS WITH ME.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.621
   IT MAKES ME FEEL INVISIBLE
     IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.756
       - ALL RIGHT, FINE.
          I'LL JUST--

07:04.758 --> 07:07.893
         I'LL JUST PLAY
      BADMINTON BY MYSELF.

07:07.895 --> 07:11.530
 - DUDE, THAT WAS REALLY HARSH.
 IT MADE ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.833
    - SETTING BOUNDARIES IS
 SOMETIMES UNCOMFORTABLE, OKAY?

07:14.835 --> 07:18.537
         CAN YOU PLEASE
         NOT BE A PUSS?

07:18.539 --> 07:20.639
          - NOW I FEEL
      TERRIBLY DEPRESSED.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.809
          SERVE ME UP
 SOME CHARRED CARCASS, PLEASE.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.777
            - HERE.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.180
         LAURIE--LAURIE
     WILL APPROVE OF THAT.

07:28.182 --> 07:29.681
          - HILARIOUS.
            - YEAH.

07:29.683 --> 07:32.217
     THIS'LL HAVE NO EFFECT
      ON YOUR CHOLESTEROL.

07:33.786 --> 07:34.786
       - [clears throat]

07:34.788 --> 07:36.755
           SO, LOU...

07:36.757 --> 07:39.691
         FIONA TELLS ME
   YOU'RE AN AMAZING PLUMBER.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.927
  - I HOPE THAT'S NOT SARCASM,
   'CAUSE I STAND BY MY WORK.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.962
AND I APPRECIATE YOU NOT GIVING
   ME A NEGATIVE YELP REVIEW

07:43.964 --> 07:45.797
  UNTIL I HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE
   WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN HERE.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.800
         - OH, IT'S NOT
        SARCASM AT ALL.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.769
       WILL YOU JUST SAY
       SOMETHING FLIRTY?

07:50.771 --> 07:53.839
     - I WOULDN'T GIVE YOU
       A NEGATIVE REVIEW.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.740
   - WELL, JUST AS I THOUGHT.

07:55.742 --> 07:58.710
     BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY
      AN ACT OF VANDALISM.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.212
       WHATEVER HAPPENED
    DOWN THERE WAS VIOLENT,

08:00.214 --> 08:01.780
    AND IT WAS INTENTIONAL.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.014
  BUT I ALREADY DID SOME WORK
          ON THE SINK,

08:03.016 --> 08:05.150
        SO IT'S COVERED
   UNDER MY SERVICE WARRANTY.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.918
  - YEAH, AND I CAN'T DO THIS.
        - YES, YOU CAN.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.620
        - NO. I-I CAN'T.
           - PLEASE?

08:08.622 --> 08:11.990
 I CAN'T MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS,
      BECAUSE IT WAS HER.

08:11.992 --> 08:16.061
          SHE DID IT,
   AND SHE YANKED MY SPRAYER.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.763
           [whistles]
             - OH.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.966
         YOU GUYS HAVE
  A LITTLE DOMESTIC SKIRMISH?

08:20.968 --> 08:22.868
     - OH, NO, WE'RE NOT--
      WE'RE NOT DOMESTIC.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.971
      - YEAH, WE'RE JUST--
  WE'RE TWO HETEROSEXUAL GIRLS

08:25.973 --> 08:28.173
     LOOKING TO MEET A MAN
    IN THIS CRAZY-ASS WORLD.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.075
 - WELL, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT
       TO YOUR OWN SINK?

08:30.077 --> 08:31.710
        I MEAN, IT'S A--
     IT'S A WONDERFUL SINK.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.246
    - SHE KNEW THAT I JUST--
WELL, I WANTED TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

08:34.248 --> 08:36.982
    - SEE? AND HERE YOU ARE.
             FATE.

08:36.984 --> 08:41.086
     - I'M SORRY. WHAT--WHY
WOULD YOU WANT TO SEE ME AGAIN?

08:43.756 --> 08:45.056
              OH.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.058
              ME?
           SERIOUSLY?

08:47.060 --> 08:49.761
           UH, WELL,
       I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

08:49.763 --> 08:51.930
      I'M STILL GONNA HAVE
TO CHARGE YOU FOR THE--FOR THE--

08:51.932 --> 08:54.666
  FOR THE SINK, BUT HOW WOULD
  YOU LIKE TO GO FOR DINNER--

08:54.668 --> 08:55.867
             - YES!

08:57.270 --> 08:59.137
        [knock at door]

08:59.139 --> 09:00.572
           - DARLING?

09:00.574 --> 09:02.607
         CAN I COME IN?

09:02.609 --> 09:05.744
     I JUST WANTED TO TALK
    TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.746
             SO...

09:07.748 --> 09:10.615
         YOU AND I ARE
    LIKE TWO PEAS IN A POD.

09:10.617 --> 09:13.552
   AND FOR THE LAST 11 YEARS,
  IT'S BEEN A VERY TIGHT POD,

09:13.554 --> 09:15.820
        PROBABLY TIGHTER
        THAN IS HEALTHY.

09:15.822 --> 09:18.757
   WHAT I'VE COME TO REALIZE
       IS THAT SOMETIMES

09:18.759 --> 09:20.992
         IT'S IMPORTANT
      FOR ONE OF THE PEAS

09:20.994 --> 09:23.595
       TO VENTURE BRIEFLY
         OUT OF THE POD

09:23.597 --> 09:26.765
         TO HAVE DINNER
    WITH A THIRD-PARTY PEA.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.767
       DO YOU UNDERSTAND
 WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY TO YOU?

09:28.769 --> 09:30.735
          - I'M AFRAID
 YOU MAY HAVE OVER-METAPHORED.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.971
  CAN YOU BACK UP TO THE PART
   ABOUT THE THIRD-PARTY PEA?

09:32.973 --> 09:36.741
     SO THE THIRD-PARTY PEA
           IS A MAN,

09:36.743 --> 09:39.311
          AND THAT MAN
  HAS ASKED ME OUT FOR DINNER.

09:39.313 --> 09:40.912
        HOW DO YOU FEEL
          ABOUT THAT?

09:40.914 --> 09:43.748
        - HOW DO I FEEL?
         I FEEL GREAT!

09:43.750 --> 09:46.151
          OH, MY GOSH.
        WILL IS THE PEA!

09:46.153 --> 09:47.886
  WILL IS THE THIRD-PARTY PEA!

09:47.888 --> 09:51.156
         - NO, MARCU--
        OH, BLOODY HELL.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.926
       [doorknob jiggles]

09:54.928 --> 09:57.295
             WILL?

09:57.297 --> 09:59.130
          WILL, WHY IS
        OUR DOOR LOCKED?

09:59.132 --> 10:01.900
           - BECAUSE
    I'M SETTING BOUNDARIES.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.869
       - [gasps] HOW DARE
    YOU CHEAT ON MY MOTHER!

10:04.871 --> 10:07.672
       GET YOUR OWN POD!
       GET YOUR OWN POD!

10:07.674 --> 10:09.741
            - OKAY.
           - MOTHER?

10:09.743 --> 10:11.276
             - SHH.

10:13.846 --> 10:14.079
               .

10:14.081 --> 10:15.280
           - [sighs]

10:15.282 --> 10:17.716
 I DON'T LIKE THIS, MARGUERITE.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.884
   I DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.853
        [doorbell rings]
   - I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE!

10:21.855 --> 10:24.889
 MARGUERITE, CAN YOU GRAB THAT?

10:28.794 --> 10:30.895
             - OH.
   HEY, THERE, LITTLE FELLA.

10:30.897 --> 10:33.898
       IS YOUR MOM HOME?
 - MOTHER'S IN THE OTHER ROOM.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.400
  SHE WILL BE OUT MOMENTARILY.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.968
           - [laughs]
             OKAY.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.972
       WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.340
          MINE'S LOU.

10:42.342 --> 10:46.745
 IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF MY TIME
    TO COMMIT IT TO MEMORY,

10:46.747 --> 10:48.713
   FOR YOU ARE MERELY A BLIP,

10:48.715 --> 10:52.417
      A MOMENTARY PIT STOP
  ON THE ROAD TO WILLS-VILLE.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.818
           - MARCUS!

10:53.820 --> 10:55.320
             HELLO.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.790
   UH, I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.058
           THANK YOU
   FOR COMING TO PICK ME UP.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.226
         - NO PROBLEM.
          NO PROBLEM.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.360
         YOU LOOK GOOD.
             - OH.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.295
   - LIKE YOU MADE AN EFFORT.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.031
          - THANK YOU.
            - YEAH.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.833
        - YOU LOOK LIKE
    YOU MADE AN EFFORT TOO.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.101
         [both chuckle]

11:10.103 --> 11:11.770
           - THANKS.
            THANKS.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.371
           - OH! AH.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.907
          - ALL RIGHT.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.342
        - BYE, DARLING.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.914
         OH, THANK YOU.

11:22.916 --> 11:27.152
    - IT'S A BIT OF A CLIMB.
   YOU GOT TO PUT YOUR FOOT--

11:27.154 --> 11:28.787
           - [laughs]
     - OH--OH, HERE WE ARE.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.321
             JUST--
    - OH, HOLD ON, HERE'S--

11:30.323 --> 11:31.756
      - WELL, I'LL JUST--
             - OH!

11:31.758 --> 11:33.024
            [laughs]
      [truck door closes]

11:33.026 --> 11:34.826
          [both laugh]

11:34.828 --> 11:36.094
          - ALL RIGHT.
        - MARGUERITE...

11:36.096 --> 11:38.296
      I NEED TO HAVE WORDS
         WITH SOMEONE.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.965
         DON'T WAIT UP.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.441
        [music playing]

11:49.443 --> 11:51.076
             - HEY.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.911
     ¶ I WANTS THE SHASTA ¶

11:52.913 --> 11:55.747
        WHERE'S SHASTA?
       - WE NEED TO TALK.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.849
            - WHAT?
      WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:57.851 --> 11:59.851
   - I'M EATING MY FEELINGS.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.820
         - NO, PUT DOWN
  THE CHEESE PLATTER, MARCUS.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.421
      HONESTLY, WE'RE NOT
       DOING THIS, OKAY?

12:03.423 --> 12:05.490
           ALL RIGHT,
 WE'RE NOT GETTING A DOG, OKAY?

12:05.492 --> 12:09.861
       AND I SURE AS HELL
  AM NOT GONNA DATE YOUR MOM,

12:09.863 --> 12:11.763
       NOT NOW, NOT EVER,

12:11.765 --> 12:14.432
           SO BACK UP
   OFF THE CHEESE PLATE, MAN!

12:14.434 --> 12:16.501
[music continues in background]

12:16.503 --> 12:17.769
       MARCUS, I'M SORRY.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.804
    - WHY CAN'T YOU JUST TRY
          TO LIKE HER?

12:19.806 --> 12:20.905
         - MARCUS, I--

12:20.907 --> 12:22.407
      - YOU DIDN'T LIKE ME
           AT FIRST,

12:22.409 --> 12:24.309
         BUT EVENTUALLY
        I WORE YOU DOWN.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.844
  SHE COULD WEAR YOU DOWN TOO.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.046
   - YOUR MOTHER DOESN'T WANT
     TO WEAR ME DOWN, OKAY?

12:28.048 --> 12:29.881
         OUR FEELINGS--
      OUR LACK OF FEELINGS

12:29.883 --> 12:31.816
      ARE ENTIRELY MUTUAL,
           ALL RIGHT?

12:31.818 --> 12:35.153
 LIKE, I LIKE YOUR MOM, BUT I--
     JUST NOT IN THAT WAY.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.355
      - WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
        WHAT'S THAT WAY?

12:37.357 --> 12:39.958
     - YOU KNOW, THAT WAY.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.761
  THE--THE WAY I LIKE SOMEONE
          LIKE SHASTA.

12:42.763 --> 12:46.765
     THAT SHASTA WAS BELOW
  NORMAL HUMAN INTELLIGENCE...

12:46.767 --> 12:47.932
           - WELL...
      - AND THAT SOMETIMES

12:47.934 --> 12:49.300
  SHE FORGETS HER UNDERPANTS.

12:49.302 --> 12:55.240
  - WELL, YES, BUT I-I-I WANT
    TO DO THINGS TO SHASTA,

12:55.242 --> 12:57.509
 THINGS THAT I DEFINITELY DON'T
   WANT TO DO TO YOUR MOTHER.

12:57.511 --> 12:58.977
         - WHAT THINGS?

13:00.813 --> 13:02.480
       - ALL RIGHT, DUDE,
         YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:02.482 --> 13:04.282
     I'M JUST GONNA LAY IT
     ON THE TABLE FOR YOU.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.984
       YOUR MOTHER AND I
        AREN'T ATTRACTED

13:05.986 --> 13:08.319
    TO EACH OTHER SEXUALLY.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.088
      - THAT'S A CONFUSING
          AREA FOR ME.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.456
         - YEAH, WELL,
       GET IN LINE, DUDE.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.224
     - LIKE, I KNOW BABIES
       AREN'T REALLY MADE

13:13.226 --> 13:14.859
          WHEN A CLOUD
      HIGH-FIVES A RAINBOW

13:14.861 --> 13:16.494
   DURING A FAIRY-DUST STORM.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.897
  THAT'S JUST SOMETHING MY MOM
   TOLD ME WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.865
       - YOU AND YOUR MOM
       HAVE HAD THE TALK,

13:20.867 --> 13:21.933
      THE SEX TALK, RIGHT?

13:21.935 --> 13:24.102
          - SHE TRIED
     TO SAY SOMETHING ONCE,

13:24.104 --> 13:26.404
        BUT THEN I WENT
      INTO A FUGUE STATE.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.873
   SHE CALLS IT "MY ADORABLE,
   LITTLE COPING MECHANISM."

13:28.875 --> 13:31.042
       - OKAY, THAT IS--
     THAT'S--THAT'S WEIRD,

13:31.044 --> 13:33.311
        BUT LISTEN, MAN,
      THERE ARE THINGS...

13:33.313 --> 13:35.547
       THERE ARE FEELINGS
  THAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND.

13:35.549 --> 13:39.350
            - COOL.
         A LIFE LESSON.

13:41.555 --> 13:45.323
     I SWEAR TO GOD, THAT'S
   WHAT KEEPS ME IN BUSINESS.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.591
  I MEAN, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
       SOME OF THE STUFF

13:46.593 --> 13:48.259
          THAT I PULL
 OUT OF THESE PIPES, BUT HAIR?

13:48.261 --> 13:50.595
       WHY I CAN TAKE YOU
  TO A FANCY PLACE LIKE THIS.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.597
           [chuckles]
     - AND ALSO THE REASON

13:52.599 --> 13:54.265
          THAT WE MET.
             - HA!

13:54.267 --> 13:56.968
         YOU'RE RIGHT.
       YOU'RE RIGHT--OH.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.571
     ISN'T THAT SOMETHIN'?

13:59.573 --> 14:01.840
            - NOW...

14:01.842 --> 14:03.975
   AREN'T THOSE PIPES LOVELY?

14:03.977 --> 14:06.511
    THEY MUST BE INTERESTING
     FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.413
       IS THAT WHY YOU--
     YOU PICKED THIS PLACE?

14:08.415 --> 14:10.982
     - NO, NO, IT IS NOT--
            WHAT A--

14:10.984 --> 14:12.584
         WHAT A MOCKERY
       OF MY PROFESSION.

14:12.586 --> 14:14.919
         LOOK AT THIS.
  THEY DON'T EVEN GO ANYWHERE.

14:14.921 --> 14:17.622
     - THEY GO IN A SQUARE.
    - WELL, THAT IS STUPID.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.991
             RIGHT?
            - YEAH.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.893
             - UGH.
     [mutters indistinctly]

14:21.895 --> 14:24.128
   - UM, YOU KNOW, I-I KNOW.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.164
     YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

14:26.166 --> 14:31.002
          IN ENGLAND,
       A LOO IS A TOILET.

14:31.004 --> 14:34.105
     AND YOUR NAME IS LOU.
             - YEP.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.341
   THAT'S, UH...THAT'S GOOD.
           - I JUST--

14:36.343 --> 14:38.409
          IT WAS A...
            - YEAH.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.879
   - THEN NINE MONTHS LATER,
         A BABY'S BORN,

14:40.881 --> 14:44.349
  BUT ONLY IF THE INTERCOURSE
         WAS SUCCESSFUL

14:44.351 --> 14:47.018
       OR NOT SUCCESSFUL,
         DEPENDING ON--

14:47.020 --> 14:49.153
      DEPENDING ON, UH...

14:49.155 --> 14:50.622
           YOU KNOW,
    WE'RE GONNA STOP THERE.

14:50.624 --> 14:52.657
          YEAH, THAT'S
    A LITTLE MORE ADVANCED.

14:52.659 --> 14:55.193
          SO DO YOU--
   DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

14:55.195 --> 14:57.328
    DOES IT ALL MAKE SENSE?

14:57.330 --> 14:58.930
         ARE YOU OKAY--

14:58.932 --> 15:00.899
         ARE YOU IN A--
   ARE YOU IN A FUGUE STATE?

15:00.901 --> 15:02.233
        [knock at door]

15:02.235 --> 15:03.902
    - I'M--I'M STILL HERE...

15:03.904 --> 15:05.937
           - COMING.
           - I THINK.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.538
           - [sighs]

15:07.540 --> 15:09.607
             - OH.
          - HI, WILL.

15:09.609 --> 15:10.942
             - WOW.
             - MM.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.077
         - MY GOODNESS.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.514
       SO, SHASTA, UM...

15:16.516 --> 15:18.983
  WOULD YOU MIND, UH, WAITING
        OUT ON THE PORCH

15:18.985 --> 15:19.984
    FOR, LIKE, TWO MINUTES?

15:19.986 --> 15:21.486
            - OKAY.
            - YEAH.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.354
          - BUT HURRY,
   BECAUSE I'M TOTALLY HORNY.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.423
          - [chuckles]

15:27.059 --> 15:28.927
            - I KNOW
      WHAT THAT MEANS NOW.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.296
  ALL THOSE PLAYGROUND JOKES--

15:31.298 --> 15:32.931
      IT MAKES SENSE NOW.

15:32.933 --> 15:36.167
        IT'S LIKE A VEIL
        HAS BEEN LIFTED.

15:36.169 --> 15:40.238
   I NEED TO GO PROCESS THIS
     IN A COOL, DRY PLACE.

15:43.342 --> 15:46.044
        YOU DISGUST ME.

15:47.046 --> 15:48.479
      - THAT KID IS WEIRD.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.281
           - [sighs]

15:50.283 --> 15:52.317
            MARCUS.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.986
      MARCUS, THAT IS NOT
       A COOL, DRY PLACE!

15:54.988 --> 15:56.654
            MARCUS!

16:00.693 --> 16:02.694
   THIS IS NOT COOL, MARCUS!

16:02.696 --> 16:06.197
 - IT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN A WHILE

16:06.199 --> 16:08.700
   SINCE I'VE BEEN ON A DATE.

16:08.702 --> 16:10.268
             - HMM.
        - BUT, YOU KNOW,

16:10.270 --> 16:14.138
    THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
      INCREDIBLY AWKWARD.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.673
         - THEN I GUESS
     WE'RE DOING IT RIGHT.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.608
           - HOORAY!
         [both chuckle]

16:26.018 --> 16:28.453
           - [pants]
       KEEP IT OUT FRONT.

16:28.455 --> 16:31.089
        I WON'T BE LONG.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.658
        BACK THE HECK UP
         OFF MY MOTHER!

16:33.660 --> 16:36.427
      I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.
       THIS IS FOREPLAY.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.663
         DON'T YOU DARE
        INTERCOURSE HER!

16:41.201 --> 16:45.136
       - MOM, I NEED YOU
          TO END THIS

16:45.138 --> 16:48.172
         BECAUSE I HAVE
    SOME THINGS TO TELL YOU

16:48.174 --> 16:51.175
         THAT ARE GONNA
      ROCK...YOUR...WORLD.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.578
 - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
      - INTERCOURSE, MOM.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.580
 I'M TALKING ABOUT INTERCOURSE!
             - OH--

16:55.582 --> 16:57.115
         - WHOA, OKAY.
       HEY, THERE, SPORT.

16:57.117 --> 17:00.218
 LOOK, I WOULD NEVER LAY A HAND
       ON YOUR MOTHER...

17:00.220 --> 17:02.353
       UNLESS, YOU KNOW,
    YOU WANTED ME TO, FIONA.

17:02.355 --> 17:05.656
   - DARLING, WHERE ON EARTH
    DID YOU HEAR THAT WORD?

17:05.657 --> 17:07.125
           - OH. HI.

17:07.127 --> 17:10.461
       HOLD ON A SECOND.
            HOLD ON.

17:10.463 --> 17:13.364
            OH, HEY.
      YOU'RE THE PLUMBER.

17:13.366 --> 17:17.167
      YES, I'M SO SORRY--
  OH--ABOUT THE INTERRUPTING.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.436
     I'M GONNA TAKE MARCUS.
        - HEY, HEY, HEY.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.772
      ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
      ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

17:21.775 --> 17:23.174
           - UH, HEY,
         YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:23.175 --> 17:24.175
    I'M--I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
        AND MARCUS' DAD

17:24.176 --> 17:26.810
       - OH, NO, NO, NO.
   - THAT'S NOT MARCUS' DAD.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.447
       - AFTER EVERYTHING
     THAT WE TALKED ABOUT,

17:29.449 --> 17:31.182
       YOU HAD THE TALK--
           <i> THE TALK--</i>

17:31.184 --> 17:33.518
          WITH MY SON?
    - OKAY. OH! I'M SO SORRY

17:33.520 --> 17:36.187
   THAT A 10-YEAR-OLD DOESN'T
  KNOW WHERE BABIES COME FROM.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.688
           - I'M 11.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.457
       WHY CAN'T YOU EVER
      REMEMBER THAT, DUDE?

17:39.459 --> 17:41.159
          - ALL RIGHT.
   I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP--

17:41.161 --> 17:43.795
   - I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.
    I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

17:43.797 --> 17:47.131
   DARLING, WE'RE GONNA TALK
  ABOUT THIS LATER PRIVATELY,

17:47.133 --> 17:49.600
     IN A COOL, DRY PLACE,
    WHERE WE BOTH FEEL SAFE.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.736
 - OKAY, HEY, UH, I DON'T KNOW
     WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,

17:51.738 --> 17:54.138
 BUT I SEEM TO BE IN THE MIDDLE
       OF SOME SORT OF...

17:54.140 --> 17:56.541
  VERY WEIRD FAMILY CONFLICT.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.110
 SO I'M JUST GONNA NOT BE HERE
           RIGHT NOW.

17:59.112 --> 18:00.545
    - NO, NO, NO, YOU STAY.
      WE'LL GO. WE'LL GO.

18:00.547 --> 18:03.147
            COME ON.
   - I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

18:03.149 --> 18:05.616
       - FIONA, THANK YOU
      FOR A VERY LOVELY--

18:05.618 --> 18:07.485
   WELL, EVENING NONETHELESS.
    AND, UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:07.487 --> 18:09.087
         I'LL CALL YOU.
           - REALLY?

18:09.089 --> 18:10.221
      - NO, PROBABLY NOT.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.523
            - GOOD.
    HE FINALLY GOT THE HINT.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.859
            [sighs]
      SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

18:14.861 --> 18:18.229
         SHOULD WE, UH,
        ORDER SOME APPS?

18:20.332 --> 18:22.133
        [bicycle thuds]

18:22.135 --> 18:25.203
 - MARCUS, I'M JUST GONNA TALK
     TO WILL FOR A MINUTE.

18:28.207 --> 18:29.774
         [door closes]
     - OKAY, BEFORE YOU GET

18:29.776 --> 18:31.476
     ALL ANGRY, ALL RIGHT,
    I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

18:31.478 --> 18:33.177
     THAT I TURNED DOWN SEX
          WITH A WOMAN

18:33.179 --> 18:36.214
    NAMED AFTER A SOFT DRINK
   TO HELP YOUR SON TONIGHT.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.882
       - HOW VERY TRAGIC.

18:37.884 --> 18:41.252
      I COULD'VE GOT LAID
    TONIGHT, TOO, YOU KNOW?

18:41.254 --> 18:43.421
           - REALLY?
             - NO.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.889
            [sighs]
   I MEAN, IT WAS A DISASTER

18:44.891 --> 18:46.691
       EVEN BEFORE MARCUS
      YELLED "INTERCOURSE"

18:46.693 --> 18:48.259
         IN THE MIDDLE
    OF A CROWDED RESTAURANT.

18:48.261 --> 18:51.829
     BUT HERE'S THE THING--
     I GOT BACK OUT THERE.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.498
        I DIPPED MY TOE

18:53.500 --> 18:57.435
 IN THE REVOLTING DATING POOL.

18:57.437 --> 19:00.638
   [sighs] YOU WERE SUPPOSED
   TO BE SETTING BOUNDARIES.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.874
        -<i> YOU</i> COMPLETELY
        DROPPED THE BALL

19:02.876 --> 19:05.243
  ON THE "BIRDS AND THE BEES"
         CONVERSATION.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.644
   - YEAH, BUT I'M THE MUMMY.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.180
  I GET TO DECIDE WHEN TO HAVE

19:09.182 --> 19:11.249
        THE CONVERSATION
     ABOUT SEX WITH MY KID.

19:11.251 --> 19:15.820
  AND WHEN YOUR SON COMES OVER
     AT INCONVENIENT TIMES,

19:15.822 --> 19:18.656
     ASKING INAPPROPRIATE,
       AWKWARD QUESTIONS,

19:18.658 --> 19:21.626
       I'M GONNA ANSWER,
          BECAUSE I...

19:25.164 --> 19:28.833
      BECAUSE I'M ATTACHED
         TO HIM, FIONA.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.302
    HE'S A GOOD LITTLE DUDE.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.838
      I MEAN, HE'S WEIRD,
       BUT HE'S A GOOD--

19:33.840 --> 19:39.810
   AND SOMETIMES LITTLE DUDES
    NEED BIG DUDES' WISDOM.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.280
           - [sniffs]

19:42.282 --> 19:47.185
             WELL,
    JUST HOW GRAPHIC WAS IT?

19:49.655 --> 19:50.888
       - PRETTY GRAPHIC.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.657
        [knock at door]

19:52.659 --> 19:55.193
           - MARCUS?
     - HEY, CAN WE COME IN?

19:55.195 --> 19:56.627
   - YOU ALL RIGHT, DARLING?

19:56.629 --> 19:59.830
           SO YOUR--
      YOUR NEIGHBOR AND I

19:59.832 --> 20:01.599
     WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
        ABOUT SOMETHING.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.668
     - YOUR MOTHER THOUGHT
    IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA

20:03.670 --> 20:06.437
       IF WE SPOKE TO YOU
      ABOUT THIS TOGETHER.

20:06.439 --> 20:09.707
         - WE BOTH CARE
        ABOUT YOU A LOT,

20:09.709 --> 20:11.742
          AND THAT IS
      NEVER GONNA CHANGE.

20:11.744 --> 20:15.580
         BUT WILL AND I
  ARE NEVER GONNA GET MARRIED.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.615
        - NEVER, EVER...
            - EVER.

20:17.617 --> 20:18.883
         - EVER, EVER.
    - 'CAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE

20:18.885 --> 20:20.585
    EACH OTHER IN <i> THAT</i> WAY?

20:20.587 --> 20:23.254
             - YES.
            EXACTLY.

20:23.256 --> 20:26.224
        SO ARE WE GOOD?
      - YEAH, WE'RE GOOD.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.525
          - ALL RIGHT.
      - OKAY. WELL, WAIT.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.993
          DO YOU HAVE
      ANY MORE QUESTIONS?

20:28.995 --> 20:30.962
       - ARE YOU SERIOUS?
  YOU COULDN'T JUST LET IT GO?

20:30.964 --> 20:32.663
     YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE ME
            THE "W"?

20:32.665 --> 20:35.233
    - HE MIGHT BE CONFUSED.
      - I'M NOT CONFUSED.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.301
           I GET IT.
       I DON'T LIKE IT...

20:37.303 --> 20:39.670
         BUT I GET IT.
      - NOW WE'RE TALKING.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.906
       GOOD NIGHT, DUDE.
    - GOOD NIGHT, SWEET PEA.

20:41.908 --> 20:45.009
        - GOOD-BYE, MOM.
        GOOD NIGHT, DAD.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.712
            KIDDING.
  - THAT WASN'T FUNNY AT ALL.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.248
        - GET--GET OUT.
     - TURN OUT THE LIGHT.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.920
     - THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
- I'M NEVER GONNA SEE HIM AGAIN.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.022
       IT WAS A DISASTER.
      - THE GOOD NEWS IS,

20:58.024 --> 20:59.991
    IS YOU GOT IN THE SADDLE
         A LITTLE BIT.

20:59.993 --> 21:02.560
   YOU WARMED YOUR THIGHS UP,
   YOU SCARED AWAY SOME MOSS,

21:02.562 --> 21:05.329
          AND YOU PUT
      YOUR CHAPS BACK ON.

21:05.331 --> 21:08.466
             - OH!
           - [gasps]

21:08.468 --> 21:09.800
            - WHOO!
            - YEAH!

21:09.802 --> 21:11.702
            [laughs]
          both: WHOO!

21:11.704 --> 21:13.971
 - WE CAN TRY THE NEXT PLUMBER
          ON THE LIST.
