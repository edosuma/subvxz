WEBVTT

00:00.492 --> 00:03.515
- <i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>
- Welcome home, Bruce.

00:03.602 --> 00:04.913
BULLOCK: The Court's readying a weapon

00:04.937 --> 00:07.015
- that could destroy the city.
- (man grunts)

00:07.039 --> 00:09.339
KATHRYN: You've done it.
You've weaponized the virus.

00:09.375 --> 00:10.807
We have to escape.

00:10.843 --> 00:12.354
There's only one way
that's gonna happen.

00:12.378 --> 00:14.311
- We work together.
- So that we may be free

00:14.346 --> 00:15.646
to murder each other outside.

00:15.681 --> 00:16.681
(grunting)

00:17.983 --> 00:19.616
How do you expect to win, Oswald?

00:19.652 --> 00:22.419
I have an army of Hugo Strange's
monsters at my command.

00:22.454 --> 00:24.154
- (Selina grunting)
- Selina!

00:24.189 --> 00:26.197
- Selina, stop!
- He's not Bruce!

00:27.095 --> 00:29.259
Where is Bruce?

00:30.696 --> 00:32.040
BRUCE 2: Bruce is serving
a greater purpose.

00:32.064 --> 00:33.104
(metal clangs, body thuds)

00:33.132 --> 00:34.364
GORDON: We found another owl.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.900
We think this map indicates
the secret hideouts of the Court.

00:36.935 --> 00:38.268
James Gordon.

00:38.299 --> 00:41.305
You loved him, and
that love doomed Mario.

00:41.340 --> 00:44.908
- But guess who's really to blame?
- I am.

00:45.699 --> 00:48.679
TEMPLE SHAMAN: We will destroy
the Court of Owls

00:48.714 --> 00:52.015
and then you will do whatever I say.

00:52.051 --> 00:53.850
- Won't you?
- Yes.

00:53.886 --> 00:56.253
GORDON: The virus sample
we got from Hugo Strange,

00:56.299 --> 00:57.765
- it's gone.
- Maybe Lucius took it.

00:57.790 --> 01:00.157
No, Lee has it, too.

01:04.029 --> 01:05.174
(gasps)

01:13.806 --> 01:17.955
TEMPLE SHAMAN: The day of
judgment has come to Gotham.

01:18.151 --> 01:21.424
And to the Court of Owls.

01:22.281 --> 01:26.016
Three years ago,
a great crime was committed.

01:26.383 --> 01:29.742
Thomas and Martha Wayne were murdered.

01:29.888 --> 01:33.490
Their blood is on the Court's hands.

01:33.851 --> 01:36.186
On your hands.

01:36.280 --> 01:38.695
Thomas Wayne stood against the Court.

01:39.022 --> 01:40.931
He threatened to expose us.

01:41.077 --> 01:43.014
He paid the price.

01:43.225 --> 01:44.668
BRUCE: And my mother?

01:47.688 --> 01:49.694
She had to die as well?

01:51.233 --> 01:53.061
Why is Bruce Wayne here?

01:53.169 --> 01:55.764
He has come to pass judgment.

01:57.295 --> 01:58.894
Enough of this.

01:59.094 --> 02:00.526
You are the leader of the Court.

02:00.586 --> 02:02.184
No one disputes that.

02:02.285 --> 02:05.582
But you absent yourself from
Gotham for years at a time.

02:05.657 --> 02:07.848
Decisions had to be made.

02:08.526 --> 02:11.208
The ruling council
stands by its actions.

02:15.367 --> 02:17.267
They were your parents, Bruce.

02:17.302 --> 02:20.570
You knelt in their blood
that night in the alley.

02:20.892 --> 02:24.439
Let blood avenge blood.

02:24.804 --> 02:26.270
Give the order.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074

02:38.023 --> 02:39.489
(claps loudly)

02:40.926 --> 02:42.159
(low murmuring)

02:45.464 --> 02:47.664
(council members grunting and gasping)

02:59.411 --> 03:01.362
You hesitated.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.159
Next time, I won't.

03:09.655 --> 03:10.987
I promise.

03:11.023 --> 03:13.556
Mm. Mm.

03:14.306 --> 03:15.877
No,

03:16.353 --> 03:18.395
I know you won't.

03:19.865 --> 03:21.642
Mm.

(sirens wailing)

03:39.551 --> 03:41.218
(tires screeching)

03:42.521 --> 03:45.881
- BULLOCK: Keep me informed.
- ALFRED: Bullock, any word from Bruce?

03:45.967 --> 03:47.535
Alvarez said he wasn't at that location,

03:47.559 --> 03:49.759
but they're checking out
the next black site on the map.

03:49.795 --> 03:51.995
All right, everybody knows the score.

03:52.030 --> 03:54.498
The Court of Owls is planning
an attack on the city.

03:54.533 --> 03:56.032
They've kidnapped Bruce Wayne.

03:56.068 --> 03:57.901
And now they know we're coming for them.

03:57.936 --> 04:00.485
So be ready for anything. Let's go.

04:05.496 --> 04:07.098
GORDON: This is the ruling council.

04:07.161 --> 04:08.394
Who could've done this?

04:08.484 --> 04:10.317
Straight up execution.

04:10.415 --> 04:11.781
(coughing)

04:13.785 --> 04:15.367
Gordon.

04:15.454 --> 04:16.720
We got a breather.

04:21.125 --> 04:23.293
Gordon... traitor.

04:23.328 --> 04:24.761
Yeah.

04:24.796 --> 04:27.464
I'm a traitor. Where's Bruce Wayne?
Where's the bomb?

04:27.499 --> 04:30.259
We were betrayed. (coughs)

04:30.402 --> 04:32.454
The leader, Bruce Wayne,

04:32.673 --> 04:34.504
they killed us.

04:42.748 --> 04:44.147
ALFRED: That geezer's lying.

04:44.182 --> 04:45.615
If Master Bruce was in that room,

04:45.651 --> 04:47.484
he's being held prisoner or something

04:47.519 --> 04:49.119
I mean, it's absurd to think

04:49.154 --> 04:50.887
he had anything to do with that carnage.

04:50.923 --> 04:52.595
I still don't get
why the leader would whack

04:52.619 --> 04:53.673
his own ruling council.

04:53.728 --> 04:56.159
I mean, does this mean the virus
bomb plan thing's off?

04:56.194 --> 04:57.827
Until we have the bomb
in our possession,

04:57.863 --> 05:00.074
we have to assume the plan's still on.

05:00.465 --> 05:02.098
Maybe the leader was cleaning house.

05:02.134 --> 05:03.400
So what's the next step?

05:03.435 --> 05:06.469
Because we hit every spot
on that crystal owl and all we got

05:06.505 --> 05:08.471
were dead people wearing owl masks.

05:08.507 --> 05:10.473
We run their identities,
we track their holdings,

05:10.509 --> 05:12.842
we see where it leads us.
It worked with Kathryn.

05:12.878 --> 05:14.778
Yeah? And how long's that
gonna take then, mate?

05:15.258 --> 05:18.648
We're all trying to find Bruce, Alfred.
We're doing everything we can.

05:18.684 --> 05:20.265
Well...

05:20.632 --> 05:23.032
if only that were enough, eh?

05:26.625 --> 05:27.824
He's worried about the kid.

05:27.859 --> 05:29.536
I don't blame him.

05:29.731 --> 05:32.223
I have no idea how Bruce fits
into the Court's plans.

05:32.297 --> 05:33.723
But what we saw today,

05:33.802 --> 05:37.200
them executing their own,
they're zealots, capable of anything.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.936
Gordon, those unis you put on
Thompkins' brownstone,

05:39.972 --> 05:41.471
they called, she's home.

05:44.625 --> 05:46.629
I know what you're thinking, brother,

05:46.801 --> 05:48.840
Lee stealing the virus, that's weird.

05:49.047 --> 05:51.536
But injecting herself? Hmm?

05:51.637 --> 05:52.853
This is Lee we're talking about.

05:52.877 --> 05:55.564
You didn't hear what she
said to me last night, Harvey.

05:56.026 --> 05:57.492
Okay, fine.

05:57.541 --> 05:58.807
Go.

06:00.878 --> 06:02.778
GORDON: I'll be back as soon as I can.

06:08.426 --> 06:10.118
Come again?

06:10.277 --> 06:14.206
I said, Oswald Cobblepot is alive.

06:14.292 --> 06:15.490
He's lying.

06:15.526 --> 06:16.808
I wish that were true.

06:16.860 --> 06:18.994
He disappeared for days,
and then he shows up

06:19.060 --> 06:20.994
with some insane story
about him and Penguin

06:21.050 --> 06:23.729
being trapped in bird cages
and escaping together?

06:23.834 --> 06:26.168
- What'd you say you used, pudding?
- Red Jell-O.

06:26.203 --> 06:28.203
How stupid do you think we are?

06:28.659 --> 06:30.372
You really want me to answer that?

06:30.579 --> 06:31.812
It's a setup.

06:31.950 --> 06:34.419
BARBARA: (scoffs) Well, you would know,

06:34.545 --> 06:36.612
being an expert in betrayal.

06:36.903 --> 06:38.847
- Keep pushing me.
- GILZEAN: Calm down.

06:38.882 --> 06:41.956
Both of you. In the
interest of cooperation...

06:43.409 --> 06:45.050
...your partner's backstabbing

06:45.151 --> 06:46.901
actually led to an answer
you were seeking.

06:48.893 --> 06:53.303
Who... controls... Gotham?

06:53.864 --> 06:57.693
It's an organization calling
themselves the Court of Owls.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.639
And?

06:59.834 --> 07:01.737
Who are they? What do they want?

07:01.882 --> 07:03.805
Well, unfortunately,
my interaction was limited

07:03.841 --> 07:05.671
to a woman named Kathryn,

07:05.880 --> 07:08.247
who had a stern updo.

07:08.804 --> 07:11.132
But I can tell you there's
no interest in the underworld.

07:11.234 --> 07:13.515
So, at least for now,
you shouldn't worry about them.

07:13.550 --> 07:14.714
You should...

07:15.918 --> 07:17.722
...worry about Penguin.

07:17.855 --> 07:20.389
I'm sorry, how is that
our problem again?

07:20.424 --> 07:22.858
You're the one that shot him
and dumped in the river.

07:22.893 --> 07:24.531
Oh, Butch.

07:24.836 --> 07:26.633
I knew that your hand was made of lead,

07:26.867 --> 07:29.297
- forgot that your brain was as well.
- Cute.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.945
Thank you.

07:31.164 --> 07:35.006
The three of you conspired
to help me murder him.

07:35.561 --> 07:36.793
So in Penguin's eyes,

07:37.148 --> 07:38.795
we're all guilty.

07:40.165 --> 07:42.053
He's right.

07:42.601 --> 07:45.202
I'll get a team to hit
Penguin's house right away.

07:45.302 --> 07:46.685
Don't bother.

07:46.792 --> 07:49.052
He knows it's the first place we'd stop.

07:49.441 --> 07:51.693
He's probably stowed away
in some safe house.

07:51.844 --> 07:53.826
Good thing I know where they all are.

07:53.912 --> 07:55.993
Here we go. Together again.

07:56.115 --> 07:57.876
Oh, I should've told you,

07:58.050 --> 08:01.313
Penguin's recruited an army
of Hugo Strange's monsters.

08:02.388 --> 08:04.388
(talking indistinctly)

08:07.749 --> 08:09.234
OFFICER: Yeah, we'll see.

08:09.294 --> 08:11.742
I'll take it from here.
Head back to the station.

08:13.065 --> 08:14.965
(car engine starts)

08:16.001 --> 08:18.001
(siren wailing)

08:27.479 --> 08:28.745
Lee?

08:30.683 --> 08:31.948
It's Jim.

08:33.751 --> 08:34.985
Lee?

08:40.759 --> 08:41.991
Lee?

08:49.228 --> 08:50.767
THOMPKINS: Hello, Jim.

08:51.804 --> 08:54.905
(footsteps)

08:55.532 --> 08:57.393
I knew you'd come.

09:01.597 --> 09:03.280
Are you surprised?

09:03.859 --> 09:05.859
You look surprised.

09:06.507 --> 09:10.380
There's been a squad car
outside my house all morning.

09:10.833 --> 09:13.450
That tells me you knew
I stole the virus.

09:13.841 --> 09:15.981
Thought you'd assume I'd inject myself.

09:18.132 --> 09:19.699
I'd hoped I was wrong.

09:19.742 --> 09:21.270
Well, that'll teach you.

09:21.426 --> 09:23.723
Can I get you something? I know
how you like your whiskey.

09:24.770 --> 09:25.980
Why'd you do this?

09:26.259 --> 09:28.032
You know why, Jim.

09:28.962 --> 09:31.720
You blame yourself over
what happened to Mario?

09:32.021 --> 09:34.054
You didn't shoot him,
you didn't infect him.

09:34.605 --> 09:36.274
Wasn't your fault.

09:37.274 --> 09:39.548
I'd have to disagree
with you on that one.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.196
But, honestly, the whole
argument is moot at this point.

09:42.231 --> 09:44.263
No, it isn't, Barnes was infected

09:44.308 --> 09:46.785
for weeks before the
virus fully took hold.

09:46.839 --> 09:48.521
We can get you help.

09:48.938 --> 09:50.531
I'm no virologist, but I'd say

09:50.609 --> 09:52.648
we missed the boat on that one. (laughs)

09:53.242 --> 09:54.749
Come on, we can fight this.

09:54.822 --> 09:56.273
Come with me.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.772
Don't you want to know what the virus
has brought out in me, Jim?

10:04.086 --> 10:05.519
What it's shown me?

10:06.201 --> 10:07.662
No.

10:09.358 --> 10:11.295
My love for you.

10:14.563 --> 10:16.597
It's pretty obvious
when you think about it.

10:17.292 --> 10:19.479
Perfect Dr. Lee Thompkins.

10:19.776 --> 10:23.222
Why would she be drawn to a
man with so much darkness?

10:23.300 --> 10:26.159
Such an appetite for violence?

10:26.242 --> 10:30.365
Unless something inside her... liked it.

10:31.677 --> 10:33.669
Craved it.

10:34.841 --> 10:36.247
Needed it.

10:38.130 --> 10:39.563
That's not true.

10:40.256 --> 10:44.680
The virus has shown me how
to give in to my deepest desires.

10:45.995 --> 10:48.040
And I will no longer deny myself

10:48.641 --> 10:50.655
what I really want.

10:56.339 --> 10:59.351
There's a problem, though,
Jim, isn't there?

11:00.371 --> 11:02.665
You know what the problem is, don't you?

11:02.713 --> 11:03.846
Yeah, you need help.

11:03.893 --> 11:06.736
- No, the problem...
- (choking)

11:06.986 --> 11:09.101
is that you are always denying yourself

11:09.171 --> 11:10.866
who you really are.

11:12.124 --> 11:13.701
But I can help you with that.

11:13.795 --> 11:16.053
You see, Jim, I have a secret.

11:16.156 --> 11:18.724
(grunts)

11:18.861 --> 11:20.861
(distant siren wailing)

11:23.614 --> 11:25.614
Harvey, I found something.

11:26.202 --> 11:28.335
Right. This is a mock-up
of the map that Lucius made

11:28.371 --> 11:30.146
of all the Court's black sites, right?

11:30.232 --> 11:31.583
One problem.

11:31.677 --> 11:34.308
The place where Bruce and I found
the original crystal owl

11:34.343 --> 11:35.509
should be here.

11:35.544 --> 11:36.904
Marked.

11:37.302 --> 11:38.512
But it's not.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.749
Well, maybe it's an old owl
that hasn't been updated.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.114
No, mate, no. You're missing
the point. No, look.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.787
The Court hasn't marked all hideouts.

11:47.493 --> 11:50.443
So how did you find the house
when you stole the owl?

11:51.293 --> 11:52.943
Well, it was this little, uh,

11:53.195 --> 11:55.896
Ukrainian smuggling firm
called the Whisper Gang.

11:56.740 --> 11:59.193
And you're thinking that maybe
they know of other locations?

11:59.263 --> 12:01.122
Do you know where
we can find these clowns?

12:01.396 --> 12:02.872
I do.

12:03.906 --> 12:05.915
If there's any left alive.

12:10.012 --> 12:11.749
(grunting, glass shatters)

12:11.774 --> 12:13.444
What's he so angry about?

12:13.469 --> 12:15.215
(grunting)

12:15.251 --> 12:17.658
Oh, we hunted down these freaks

12:17.705 --> 12:20.064
- to help him destroy Nygma and Barbara.
- Mm-hmm.

12:20.089 --> 12:21.455
We got this Freeze guy

12:21.490 --> 12:23.857
and your pal Bridgit,
who does the... the fire thing.

12:23.893 --> 12:25.557
Wait, you found Bridgit?

12:25.995 --> 12:27.661
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

12:27.734 --> 12:29.229
Pengy disappeared the other day,

12:29.272 --> 12:30.709
and she and Freeze figured
he wasn't coming back,

12:30.733 --> 12:32.132
so they split.

12:32.429 --> 12:34.984
- Can you find her?
- Why?

12:35.171 --> 12:38.230
There is a war coming
between me, Ed Nygma,

12:38.255 --> 12:39.406
and Barbara Kean.

12:39.442 --> 12:40.574
I need my army.

12:41.044 --> 12:42.935
What's in it for me?

12:43.591 --> 12:45.345
My gratitude.

12:45.381 --> 12:46.691
Hmm.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.015
Fine.

12:48.050 --> 12:50.818
(booming thud)

12:51.511 --> 12:52.853
- (thud)
- Uh, you guys,

12:52.888 --> 12:54.838
we got company... not the good kind.

12:54.863 --> 12:56.155
Ivy, let's go.

12:56.180 --> 12:57.669
- Well, I can't leave Penguin.
- (banging on door)

12:57.693 --> 12:59.640
(sighs): Oh, suit yourself.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.205
You do have a way out, right?

13:01.489 --> 13:03.817
Of course. This is a safe house.

13:04.926 --> 13:06.467
- Oswald!
- (gasping shriek)

13:08.167 --> 13:09.603
Edward.

13:10.806 --> 13:13.667
No army of monsters, huh? Such a shame.

13:14.323 --> 13:17.354
- You want to kill him, or can I?
- Wait.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.291
Something's wrong.

13:25.378 --> 13:27.054
Oh, Ed.

13:27.686 --> 13:29.523
So smart.

13:29.558 --> 13:32.459
(beeping, shutters clanging)

13:32.495 --> 13:34.394
(alarm bell ringing)

13:34.926 --> 13:36.730
No!

13:37.519 --> 13:38.599
Damn it!

13:38.816 --> 13:40.348
Bravo, Oswald!

13:40.436 --> 13:41.735
(alarm bell continues)

13:41.921 --> 13:44.100
But you're just delaying the inevitable.

13:44.561 --> 13:46.073
Where's your far better half?

13:50.927 --> 13:52.384
Where you going, kitty cat?

14:04.001 --> 14:05.861
Bruce.

14:09.751 --> 14:12.499
What were you thinking about?

14:14.215 --> 14:15.547
My parents.

14:17.039 --> 14:19.399
I've wanted justice for them
for so long.

14:21.024 --> 14:22.983
And now that I've achieved it...

14:25.850 --> 14:27.670
What do you feel?

14:29.852 --> 14:31.184
Failure.

14:32.286 --> 14:34.341
I did not give the order.

14:35.153 --> 14:36.778
You will get another chance

14:36.849 --> 14:38.775
- to prove yourself worthy.
- (door opens)

14:39.995 --> 14:41.962
(approaching footsteps)

14:44.466 --> 14:46.199
Hello, Bruce.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.442
It is good to see you again.

14:50.882 --> 14:52.482
Hello, Professor.

14:54.343 --> 14:56.020
Fascinating.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.813
He's completely docile.

15:00.612 --> 15:03.089
I'd like to hear your techniques,

15:03.815 --> 15:05.185
sensei.

15:05.956 --> 15:07.521
One day, Professor.

15:09.025 --> 15:10.490
Show me the weapon.

15:19.210 --> 15:23.077
I told you, Bruce,
that I did not serve the Court.

15:23.217 --> 15:27.003
TEMPLE SHAMAN:
I... we made use of the Court

15:27.043 --> 15:29.262
for our own ends.

15:29.378 --> 15:32.145
The one I serve believes
you have a great destiny.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.915
My task has been to prepare you for it,

15:34.950 --> 15:38.062
but a final step remains
in your journey.

15:45.961 --> 15:49.444
This detonator will trigger the bomb.

15:49.608 --> 15:52.420
Thousands will be
infected with the virus,

15:52.490 --> 15:54.668
the city will be torn apart,

15:54.809 --> 15:57.488
and out of the ashes...

15:58.160 --> 16:01.356
a dark hero will rise.

16:01.610 --> 16:02.996
You.

16:03.262 --> 16:04.614
Mm.

16:07.994 --> 16:11.404
When the time comes, you
must press this button.

16:12.083 --> 16:15.055
Are you ready to embrace
your destiny, Bruce?

16:15.607 --> 16:17.090
Yes.

16:19.623 --> 16:21.995
Gotham must fall.

16:27.567 --> 16:30.097
Jim, me and Alfred got
a possible location on Bruce

16:30.167 --> 16:32.261
from a bunch of Ukrainian
yucks wearing muzzles,

16:32.300 --> 16:33.502
if you can believe it.

16:33.547 --> 16:35.079
Give me a call when you can.

16:35.131 --> 16:37.751
- Where the hell is Gordon, anyway?
- He had to do something.

16:41.723 --> 16:45.188
We're gonna have to give you a badge
or something one of these days.

16:50.365 --> 16:52.398
(distant sirens wailing)

16:54.674 --> 16:59.463
STRANGE: Please be very careful with this.

17:03.345 --> 17:04.611
GCPD! Nobody...

17:08.383 --> 17:10.415
(gunshot)

17:10.599 --> 17:12.396
Go get Bruce!

17:12.721 --> 17:13.989
Don't move a muscle.

17:14.161 --> 17:17.270
Obviously, I surrender.

17:20.727 --> 17:22.827
You know where to take it.

17:23.098 --> 17:24.531
Bruce!

17:27.035 --> 17:28.560
ALFRED: Oh, thank God.

17:28.966 --> 17:31.239
So you're the top boy, are you?

17:31.872 --> 17:33.206
The leader?

17:35.644 --> 17:37.744
Step away from Bruce, or I swear to God

17:37.779 --> 17:39.700
I will shoot you straight in the face.

17:39.915 --> 17:43.848
You had best put down
the weapon, Mr. Pennyworth.

17:44.085 --> 17:46.421
Not bloody likely, mate.

17:50.091 --> 17:51.804
ALFRED: Bruce?

17:54.563 --> 17:56.551
Bruce, get out of the light.

17:57.747 --> 17:59.270
No, Alfred.

17:59.801 --> 18:01.754
I will not let you hurt him.

18:03.004 --> 18:04.912
What's he done to you?

18:05.530 --> 18:08.334
He has lifted the burden of my past.

18:08.819 --> 18:11.076
Revealed my true destiny.

18:12.747 --> 18:15.915
Gotham must fall by my hand.

18:17.868 --> 18:19.430
No.

18:19.711 --> 18:20.987
Bruce!

18:32.200 --> 18:33.559
- Dwayne.
- Yes, sir.

18:33.602 --> 18:36.836
Hey, Steve, put this animal in a cage.

18:37.090 --> 18:39.730
I'll be back
to bust your head in a minute.

18:47.041 --> 18:48.994
Alfred, hey.

18:49.384 --> 18:50.750
Are you okay?

18:51.096 --> 18:53.041
Far from it.

18:53.221 --> 18:54.654
I mean, the leader of the Court

18:54.697 --> 18:56.133
has turned Bruce into
some kind of, like,

18:56.157 --> 18:57.523
weird zombie zealot.

18:57.869 --> 19:00.978
I mean, I wouldn't have believed it
if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

19:01.072 --> 19:03.263
I think he wants Bruce
to detonate the bomb.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.178
- What?!
- Bruce said something about

19:05.220 --> 19:07.233
it being his destiny.

19:07.694 --> 19:10.108
How Gotham must fall by his hand.

19:10.205 --> 19:11.710
This is bad.

19:11.873 --> 19:13.975
We got to find that friggin' bomb.

19:14.030 --> 19:16.304
Let's go see baldy-locks
and see what he can tell us.

19:16.374 --> 19:17.610
CAMPOS: Harvey.

19:17.646 --> 19:19.123
Heard from the unis at Doc Thompkins'.

19:19.147 --> 19:20.788
No sign of her or Gordon or his car.

19:21.225 --> 19:23.384
Put a BOLO out on Jim Gordon.

19:23.852 --> 19:27.129
- And put one out on Lee Thompkins, too.
- I'm right here, Harvey.

19:33.361 --> 19:36.062
Lee. Hey.

19:38.151 --> 19:39.532
BULLOCK: It's good to see you.

19:43.805 --> 19:45.986
You wouldn't happen to know
where Jim is, would you?

19:46.111 --> 19:49.493
As a matter of fact,
he's probably waking up

19:50.064 --> 19:54.687
right about now.

20:16.271 --> 20:18.271
(panicked breathing)

20:46.917 --> 20:48.479
Lee.

20:50.839 --> 20:52.237
Lee.

20:53.034 --> 20:55.875
Lee...!

20:56.036 --> 20:58.099
Lee...

20:58.247 --> 21:01.896
(muted): Lee! Lee...!

21:02.154 --> 21:04.544
Lee!

21:07.751 --> 21:11.306
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy, everybody.

21:11.391 --> 21:14.022
Guns down, people. It's all right.

21:14.069 --> 21:15.944
Everybody just step back.

21:18.108 --> 21:20.358
You really did it, huh?

21:20.767 --> 21:22.671
You injected yourself with the virus?

21:22.726 --> 21:25.046
You're just like Jim, you seem
to think it's a bad thing.

21:25.444 --> 21:26.960
Where is he?

21:27.540 --> 21:29.245
He went to see you at your brownstone,

21:29.300 --> 21:30.586
and now we can't get in touch with him.

21:30.610 --> 21:33.144
THOMPKINS: Well, look at you,
all worried about your hero.

21:33.531 --> 21:35.539
You put him up on this pedestal,

21:35.617 --> 21:37.802
forced him to deny his true self.

21:38.547 --> 21:42.880
I am going to free Jim
and show everyone who he really is.

21:42.956 --> 21:44.922
Where the hell is he?

21:47.760 --> 21:51.327
He's in a coffin, six feet underground.

21:52.031 --> 21:53.598
Did you kill him?

21:53.633 --> 21:55.199
(laughs)

21:55.235 --> 21:57.079
Who said anything about killing him?

21:58.063 --> 21:59.829
Oh, bloody hell.

22:00.118 --> 22:02.313
I said he was in a coffin.

22:02.542 --> 22:04.142
He's not dead.

22:04.243 --> 22:05.289
Not yet.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.712
Oh, geez.

22:11.102 --> 22:14.401
I forgot how jumpy
everybody is around here.

22:15.141 --> 22:16.774
Jim, are you there?

22:16.803 --> 22:17.968
(radio crackling)

22:18.322 --> 22:20.204
THOMPKINS: <i>Jim, you there?</i>

22:21.040 --> 22:22.606
(beeps)

22:22.642 --> 22:24.641
Lee, what the hell are you doing?

22:24.877 --> 22:25.943
<i>Stay calm.</i>

22:26.243 --> 22:28.078
<i>You've got to conserve your air.</i>

22:28.453 --> 22:30.314
- Listen to me...
- <i>(Thompkins laughs)</i>

22:30.349 --> 22:32.283
Little late for that.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.318
<i>Why don't you say hi
to Harvey and the gang?</i>

22:34.380 --> 22:35.927
Harvey? You there?

22:37.239 --> 22:38.816
We're here, buddy. Where are you?

22:39.019 --> 22:40.676
GORDON: <i>Harvey, she's got the virus.</i>

22:40.707 --> 22:42.316
- <i>She's buried me alive...</i>
- Shh.

22:42.996 --> 22:44.465
<i>I do the talking.</i>

22:44.587 --> 22:45.919
<i>Now, if you're quiet,</i>

22:45.996 --> 22:47.387
<i>I'll let you listen.</i>

22:48.017 --> 22:49.590
So, here's the deal.

22:50.829 --> 22:54.071
I buried Jim Gordon alive

22:54.790 --> 22:57.264
in a location that you might
find if you looked long enough,

22:57.424 --> 22:59.166
but certainly not
before he runs out of air.

22:59.393 --> 23:02.479
<i>Meaning, I'm the only one
who knows where he is.</i>

23:02.605 --> 23:03.937
But...

23:04.041 --> 23:06.010
now here's the kicker...

23:07.450 --> 23:09.420
I left him a way out.

23:10.038 --> 23:11.745
You hear that, Jim?

23:12.506 --> 23:16.311
<i>I left you an escape hatch.
Have you found it yet?</i>

23:19.922 --> 23:21.794
<i>You should've found it by now.</i>

23:33.354 --> 23:34.868
You left me the virus.

23:34.904 --> 23:36.462
(laughs)

23:36.487 --> 23:39.940
I told you I would help you
find your darkness.

23:40.270 --> 23:41.441
Now,

23:41.504 --> 23:43.285
<i>I can't do it for you.</i>

23:43.574 --> 23:45.379
<i>You've got to do it yourself.</i>

23:45.504 --> 23:48.793
I won't. I won't do it, Lee.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.823
You've got two options.

23:52.121 --> 23:53.587
You can take the virus,

23:53.760 --> 23:56.073
<i>and find the strength
and get out of there,</i>

23:56.299 --> 23:59.960
or you can make that coffin
your permanent home.

23:59.995 --> 24:01.729
Lee, please. Please.

24:02.073 --> 24:06.198
In the name of all
that is holy and not insane...

24:07.303 --> 24:08.987
...tell us where he is.

24:09.271 --> 24:11.716
I swear to God, I'll let you
walk right out of here.

24:11.903 --> 24:13.503
Tell us where you buried him.

24:13.567 --> 24:15.771
Why would I want to walk
out of here, Harvey?

24:16.403 --> 24:19.613
I'm gonna miss the look
on all of your faces

24:19.648 --> 24:21.315
when he takes that virus.

24:21.489 --> 24:24.846
And seeing that he's got roughly
an hour left of oxygen,

24:25.237 --> 24:27.409
I'm not gonna have long to wait.

24:34.388 --> 24:36.196
Can I get a cup of coffee?

24:37.568 --> 24:39.708
Get the lady a cup of coffee.

24:40.044 --> 24:41.168
Put her in a cell.

24:41.203 --> 24:42.502
(clears throat)

24:42.538 --> 24:44.338
(laughs)

24:44.373 --> 24:46.440
Don't worry, I'm not gonna bite.

24:48.043 --> 24:51.101
All right, everyone,
Bruce Wayne is still missing.

24:51.149 --> 24:52.749
There's still a freaking
terrorist attack

24:52.790 --> 24:55.382
that could go down at any minute,
so get back to your jobs,

24:55.462 --> 24:59.019
do what you're supposed to be doing.
Let me worry about Jim Gordon.

24:59.855 --> 25:01.855
(people clamoring)

25:14.703 --> 25:15.919
BULLOCK: <i>Jim.</i>

25:15.990 --> 25:17.337
<i>It's me. You there, buddy?</i>

25:17.412 --> 25:18.705
Harvey.

25:19.060 --> 25:21.702
These radios run
on a shortwave frequency.

25:21.727 --> 25:23.876
<i>I've got to be close.
Get it over to Lucius.</i>

25:23.946 --> 25:25.979
He should be able to run down
a general fix.

25:26.352 --> 25:27.631
Hang tight, we're on it.

25:27.751 --> 25:28.882

25:29.204 --> 25:30.657

25:32.948 --> 25:34.597

25:50.629 --> 25:52.456
So you were just holed up
together for kicks?

25:52.511 --> 25:54.089
No.

25:54.206 --> 25:56.535
- Ivy just asked me to come by.
- Why?

25:57.066 --> 25:58.702
None of your business, lunk.

25:59.536 --> 26:01.285
Now I got to take lip off a kid?

26:03.389 --> 26:05.490
You're friends with
that firebug, aren't you?

26:05.546 --> 26:06.988
Her name's Bridgit.

26:07.061 --> 26:09.061
(laughs)

26:12.269 --> 26:15.160
Penguin's army of monsters deserted him.

26:15.741 --> 26:18.335
And he needed your help finding them.

26:18.420 --> 26:21.873
You're gonna tell Penguin
that you know where this Bridgit is

26:21.908 --> 26:23.842
and that you'd like to meet.

26:24.010 --> 26:25.543
And we'll take care of the rest.

26:26.899 --> 26:28.453
Fine.

26:28.664 --> 26:31.446
But I need cash to get out of town.

26:32.836 --> 26:36.087
- Fine.
- And nothing happens to Ivy.

26:37.946 --> 26:40.558
She's stupid, but not a traitor.

26:41.004 --> 26:43.561
Those things aren't mutually exclusive.

26:44.590 --> 26:47.064
Shoo. The grown-ups need to talk.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.245
Oh, and forgive me if I don't
want you knowing the details.

26:49.269 --> 26:51.669

26:51.704 --> 26:53.273

27:04.868 --> 27:06.407
BULLOCK: <i>Jim.</i>

27:06.686 --> 27:08.152
Harvey, what'd you find?

27:08.188 --> 27:09.687
<i>You were right about the walkie.</i>

27:09.722 --> 27:11.274
It's got a one mile radius.

27:11.328 --> 27:13.593
Lucius couldn't trace a signal,
but when we looked at a map,

27:13.617 --> 27:15.504
we figured there was only
one place she could take you:

27:15.528 --> 27:16.532
Jackson Park.

27:17.471 --> 27:20.391
I should've known.
But that's nothing but dense forest.

27:20.416 --> 27:22.011
- <i>You'll never...</i>
- It's a place to start.

27:22.035 --> 27:23.942
We're gonna find you, brother,
I promise.

27:24.090 --> 27:26.153
Harvey. Listen, I know he's your mate,

27:26.215 --> 27:27.645
but with everything else
that's going on,

27:27.669 --> 27:30.020
with Bruce missing, the bomb,

27:30.419 --> 27:33.344
you certain searching for Jim
is the best use of your time?

27:33.450 --> 27:36.152
If the situation were reversed,
he'd do the same for me.

27:36.277 --> 27:37.782
Besides, I got you.

27:38.012 --> 27:40.011
- What do you mean?
- I want you to squeeze Strange,

27:40.035 --> 27:41.301

27:41.340 --> 27:43.434
I saw how you dealt
with that Kathryn bird.

27:43.465 --> 27:46.018
- You like to get your hands dirty.
- Wait, are you sure about this, mate?

27:46.042 --> 27:48.009
I want you to get your hands
really dirty.

27:48.486 --> 27:51.062
I want you to find out where
the leader's taking Bruce.

27:51.175 --> 27:52.930
Find the bomb,
and however much or little

27:52.966 --> 27:55.466
is left of Strange after that,
even if it's just a pinky,

27:55.546 --> 27:57.284
we will throw in jail.

27:57.937 --> 27:59.847

in Jackson Park, now!

28:05.718 --> 28:07.500
You can't save him, Harvey.

28:07.614 --> 28:09.359
He's gonna take the virus.

28:09.449 --> 28:12.347
And we're gonna be together
the way we were meant to be!

28:13.378 --> 28:15.620
It's gonna be beautiful.

28:19.221 --> 28:21.783

28:22.408 --> 28:23.666
Get off.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.667
I find this shouting
and screaming deeply upsetting.

28:27.703 --> 28:29.561
It affects my concentration.

28:29.705 --> 28:30.837
And my grip!

28:30.873 --> 28:32.873
(gasping)

28:33.118 --> 28:36.037
Please. Don't let me fall.

28:36.111 --> 28:39.642
We can discuss this
in a civilized manner!

28:39.712 --> 28:41.625
Oh, that's rich, coming
from the likes of you.

28:41.650 --> 28:42.582

thousands of people

28:44.219 --> 28:46.579

28:47.222 --> 28:49.575
Now, where is Bruce Wayne?

28:49.625 --> 28:52.114
And where is the bomb?

28:53.176 --> 28:56.106
If I tell you, you drop me.

28:56.231 --> 28:59.824
I end up dead, either way.

29:00.785 --> 29:02.736
Self-preservation, is it?

29:02.793 --> 29:05.590
That's your game?
All right, then, Humpty.

29:07.409 --> 29:09.075
I got a swapsie for you.

29:09.111 --> 29:10.710

29:13.548 --> 29:16.756

29:17.882 --> 29:20.086
You don't have
the authority to let me go.

just to hang you

29:21.590 --> 29:23.790

29:25.160 --> 29:27.554
Hey, see that fire escape over there?

29:27.664 --> 29:29.062
That leads directly to the street

29:29.097 --> 29:30.997

Now, I won't stop you.

- Why?

29:55.659 --> 29:57.393
What time is the bomb going off?

29:57.471 --> 29:59.800
5:00 p.m., but that's not what I mean.

30:00.659 --> 30:03.764

30:05.133 --> 30:08.030

how strong that boy is.

30:19.274 --> 30:21.177

30:22.404 --> 30:23.668

Slag.

30:41.970 --> 30:45.934

with your manservant.

30:46.329 --> 30:47.562
No.

30:49.568 --> 30:51.910

30:52.738 --> 30:54.495
I do not want to fail.

everything the Court of Owls
set in motion,

38:43.899 --> 38:45.527
This is a trap?

38:45.891 --> 38:48.863
MOONEY: No, not exactly.

38:52.963 --> 38:54.353
Fish.

38:54.691 --> 38:56.815
Hello, Oswald.

38:58.611 --> 39:00.182
Now, see that there?

39:00.653 --> 39:02.653
That's a look of respect.

39:03.971 --> 39:05.557
Or is it fear?

39:06.057 --> 39:07.495
Hi-ya, Fish.

39:07.816 --> 39:10.047
- How you been?
- Well, let's see.

39:10.313 --> 39:12.133
I was alive...

39:12.513 --> 39:13.812
and then I was dead.

39:15.727 --> 39:17.497
And then I was alive.

39:19.702 --> 39:21.368
Things are looking up.

39:23.557 --> 39:26.284
My, my, my.

39:26.917 --> 39:30.096
Now, this is quite a gathering.
You have to love Gotham.

39:30.158 --> 39:32.312
People always
pointing guns at each other.

39:32.525 --> 39:33.781
Why are you here?

39:34.484 --> 39:35.781
You...

39:36.018 --> 39:37.195
shall...

39:37.836 --> 39:39.687
see.

39:42.742 --> 39:44.853
And as for you, whoever you may be,

39:45.728 --> 39:47.353
please excuse us.

39:48.413 --> 39:50.634
My little penguin and I...

39:52.040 --> 39:53.748
will be leaving.

39:58.998 --> 40:01.616
Please, carry on.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.982
Woman always knew how
to make an entrance.

40:11.153 --> 40:12.219
(door closes)

40:12.333 --> 40:14.154
MAN (over P.A.):
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

40:14.216 --> 40:17.380
<i>This is an emergency.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

40:17.443 --> 40:19.092
Gordon, there you are.

40:22.528 --> 40:24.315
MAN (over P.A.):
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

40:24.389 --> 40:28.678
<i>This is an emergency.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

40:31.592 --> 40:33.006
It's time.

40:34.143 --> 40:35.891
Press the button.

40:36.626 --> 40:38.579
Claim your destiny.

40:39.391 --> 40:43.407
Let Gotham fall so you may rise.

40:50.647 --> 40:52.360
No!

40:55.428 --> 40:57.932
Whatever destiny he's sold you,
Bruce, he's lying.

40:58.066 --> 40:59.398
- Press it, Bruce.
- Don't.

40:59.744 --> 41:01.150
Bruce, don't.

41:01.666 --> 41:03.545
I won't have him turn you
into a murderer.

41:05.466 --> 41:07.443
MAN (over P.A.): <i>This is an emergency.</i>

41:07.506 --> 41:09.621
<i>Please proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

41:13.279 --> 41:14.846
(grunting)

41:20.153 --> 41:22.716
Are you going to shoot me, Alfred?

41:23.156 --> 41:25.036
I want to help you.

41:26.479 --> 41:28.745
We'll reverse what he's done to you.

41:30.229 --> 41:33.713
Bruce, if you press that detonator,
there's no coming back.

41:34.975 --> 41:36.264
He won't shoot you.

41:36.764 --> 41:39.553
He's weak, Bruce, but you are not.

41:42.981 --> 41:44.609
Bruce, please.

41:46.535 --> 41:48.279
Give me the detonator, son.

41:49.503 --> 41:51.545
- No. You will press it.
- (detonator beeps)

41:53.153 --> 41:56.354
(bomb beeping, whirring)

41:57.612 --> 41:59.533
- (beeping)
- THOMPKINS: Hello, lover.

42:03.997 --> 42:05.997
I guess we're gonna have company.

42:06.565 --> 42:09.854
Seek out the Yuyan building.

42:09.924 --> 42:12.651
Find the demon's head.

42:13.268 --> 42:16.077
Fulfill your destiny.

42:16.142 --> 42:18.142
(exhales slowly)

42:21.584 --> 42:22.999
Bruce.

42:24.584 --> 42:26.017
(yells)

42:29.823 --> 42:31.556
(shouting)

42:34.294 --> 42:36.895
When you're ready, come and find me.

42:37.730 --> 42:39.606
It's only a matter of time.

42:39.699 --> 42:40.898
(bomb beeping)

42:44.304 --> 42:46.504
(people screaming)

42:53.513 --> 42:55.375
It's too late.

43:04.924 --> 43:06.791
(people clamoring)
