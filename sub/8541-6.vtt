[instrumental music]

00:09.270 --> 00:12.142
[indistinct chattering]

00:27.897 --> 00:30.117
- Sophie.
- Hmm.

00:30.204 --> 00:32.293
Do you think you could
persuade your sister

00:32.380 --> 00:35.165
to make at least
a token appearance?

00:35.252 --> 00:36.688
I doubt it.

00:36.775 --> 00:38.429
Please try.

00:38.516 --> 00:40.953
- Sure, mom.
- Okay.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.391
[whispers]
Oh, how are you?
Good to see you.

00:44.348 --> 00:45.654
My condolences.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.222
[knocking on door]

00:52.313 --> 00:53.705
Abs.

00:59.363 --> 01:00.321
Abs.

01:00.408 --> 01:01.365
[knocks on door]

01:02.497 --> 01:04.368
Abby, are you awake?

01:06.936 --> 01:08.155
[gasps]

01:09.286 --> 01:10.896
[gasps]

01:13.377 --> 01:15.553
- Okay, go in.
- 'Yeah, I'm on my way.'

01:15.640 --> 01:17.381
[indistinct chattering on radio]

01:19.209 --> 01:20.776
Yeah. Alright. Alright.

01:20.863 --> 01:21.777
I'm heading through
the front entrance right now.

01:21.864 --> 01:23.735
What's your 20?

01:23.822 --> 01:26.695
[indistinct chattering]

01:28.349 --> 01:29.915
Hey, boss.

01:30.002 --> 01:32.614
Victim's name is Austin Marr,
23, multiple stab wounds.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.920
Killed in the guesthouse
last night around 2 a.m.

01:35.007 --> 01:36.487
What's with all the security?

01:36.574 --> 01:37.532
Well, the house belongs
to a federal judge

01:37.619 --> 01:38.794
named Pauline Fitzwilliam.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.100
Her mother just died.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.492
Lot of VIPs are
here for the wake.

01:41.579 --> 01:43.364
Stiff security for a wake.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.017
- Where's Jane?
- Who knows?

01:45.105 --> 01:46.236
He can catch up
when he gets here.

01:46.323 --> 01:47.498
[male #1]
'Metal items in'

01:47.585 --> 01:48.978
'the plastic
containers, please.'

01:53.852 --> 01:55.071
I was looking for Abby.

01:55.158 --> 01:57.378
I didn't even know
Austin was in the house.

01:57.465 --> 01:59.858
- He doesn't live here?
- No.

01:59.945 --> 02:01.512
He's Abby's boyfriend.

02:01.599 --> 02:04.515
[sniffles]
He's sweet and gentle.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.474
Who would do this to him?

02:07.823 --> 02:09.781
I need you to stay
with me, Sophie.

02:11.087 --> 02:12.175
Okay.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.177
Does Austin have
family in the area?

02:14.264 --> 02:16.179
[exhales]
No.

02:16.266 --> 02:18.573
Sophie, do you know
where Austin works?

02:18.660 --> 02:21.445
I'm not sure. He's..

02:21.532 --> 02:24.361
He's an illustrator
for children's books.

02:24.448 --> 02:26.320
And how was his
relationship with Abby?

02:27.538 --> 02:29.061
They were in love.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.499
Austin treated her like gold.

02:31.586 --> 02:34.241
When was the last time
you saw your sister?

02:34.328 --> 02:36.547
Yesterday afternoon.

02:36.634 --> 02:38.549
Where is she?
What's happened to her?

02:38.636 --> 02:40.551
That's what we're
trying to figure out.

02:40.638 --> 02:43.685
We'll let you know as soon
as we find anything out.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.208
- Thank you for your time.
- But she's okay, right?

02:45.295 --> 02:47.384
'Cause she's my baby sister.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.299
- We'll let you know.
- Okay.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.347
I talked to security.

02:53.434 --> 02:55.262
They say they've got a sealed
perimeter around the estate.

02:55.349 --> 02:58.134
No one goes in or out
unless it's through them.

02:58.221 --> 03:00.092
Abby came in yesterday
morning at 8:40

03:00.180 --> 03:02.269
but there's no
record that she left.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.575
- So she's still in the house?
- That's the thing.

03:04.662 --> 03:07.317
Local PD and security
searched the property.

03:07.404 --> 03:10.059
Every building, every room.
They can't find her anywhere.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.191
Well, maybe she
left with someone.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.322
Security's saying no.

03:12.409 --> 03:13.497
They check everyone that leaves.

03:13.584 --> 03:14.977
They even search their cars.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.196
So Abby's missing

03:16.283 --> 03:18.328
but security says
she never left?

03:18.415 --> 03:19.938
I was having
such a good day.

03:20.025 --> 03:24.769
Cho, check out Austin.
Home. Work. Other friends.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.162
Van Pelt, get with security.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.555
I want the names of everybody

03:27.642 --> 03:29.296
who was on the property
at the time of death.

03:29.383 --> 03:30.862
- 'And I want to talk to 'em.'
- On it.

03:30.949 --> 03:33.256
Uh, and if you see Jane,
tell him he's officially tardy.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.913
[male #1]
'Sir, all metals items
in the plastic bins, please.'

03:38.000 --> 03:38.957
[beeping]

03:39.044 --> 03:40.002
Sir, please, step back.

03:40.089 --> 03:41.960
Uh...I'm with CBI.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.962
I'm in a hurry.
I'm just gonna go around.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.313
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where's your badge?

03:46.400 --> 03:48.315
- You just grabbed my arm.
- Oh, maybe you didn't hear me.

03:48.402 --> 03:52.101
Marcus Whiteside, security
chief here. Where's your badge?

03:52.188 --> 03:53.624
- That's my badge.
- Okay, then, now.

03:53.711 --> 03:54.886
- Go through the gate.
- Where's your badge?

03:54.973 --> 03:56.105
Are we gonna have
a problem here?

03:56.192 --> 03:57.280
No. Not at all.
I'm just asking.

03:57.367 --> 03:58.455
Through the gate.

03:58.542 --> 03:59.891
I'm one of the good
guys here, man.

03:59.978 --> 04:02.024
- I'm-I'm here to help.
- Family, friends, CBI.

04:02.111 --> 04:03.504
Everyone goes
through the gate.

04:03.591 --> 04:04.766
- Got it?
- I got it.

04:04.853 --> 04:05.854
That means you go
through the gate too?

04:05.941 --> 04:08.117
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

04:08.204 --> 04:10.075
Marcus, please,
be my guest. After you.

04:10.162 --> 04:11.729
The least I could do.

04:18.693 --> 04:19.824
[sighs]

04:19.911 --> 04:21.130
[beeping]

04:25.265 --> 04:26.396
Hmm.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.712
[beeping]

04:40.802 --> 04:42.238
Uh, you know, I-I may..

04:42.325 --> 04:44.284
Can I just...
please. Thank you.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.287
Mm.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.507
Seems to be working.

04:53.205 --> 04:54.903
[beeping]

04:54.990 --> 04:57.906
[theme music]

05:05.696 --> 05:07.481
Come on. I want a bite.
Just give me a bite.

05:07.568 --> 05:08.873
-No. You don't deserve it.
- I just want one bite.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.135
Well, maybe I'm just
gonna have to take it then.

05:10.222 --> 05:12.050
[Abby on TV]
'Then take it. No?'

05:15.750 --> 05:18.230
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.277
Oh. You hear that?
She loves me.

05:21.364 --> 05:23.366
[inhales deeply]

05:23.453 --> 05:25.107
I know what's
happened here.

05:26.543 --> 05:29.198
What's that, judge?

05:29.285 --> 05:30.330
Three months
ago I sentenced

05:30.417 --> 05:31.853
a man named
Raymond Tubbs

05:31.940 --> 05:34.159
to forty years without parole.

05:34.246 --> 05:36.118
He's a white supremacist,
runs a gang

05:36.205 --> 05:38.816
that's been robbing banks
up and down the coast.

05:38.903 --> 05:41.645
Mr. Tubbs swore he would
kill me and my family.

05:41.732 --> 05:45.519
So, obviously...
someone working for him

05:45.606 --> 05:48.739
killed poor Austin
and took Abby.

05:48.826 --> 05:51.655
But your security team says
nobody entered the compound.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.788
Well, they also said
Abby must still be here

05:53.875 --> 05:55.485
and they've searched
and haven't found her.

05:55.572 --> 05:59.881
So, obviously...they're
wrong in some respects.

05:59.968 --> 06:01.970
Where's Tubbs doing time?

06:02.057 --> 06:05.234
Folsom. That doesn't stop him.

06:05.321 --> 06:06.844
Last month he sent
a member of his gang

06:06.931 --> 06:08.150
to break into our house.

06:08.237 --> 06:11.066
That's when we
stepped up security.

06:11.153 --> 06:15.418
Did your forensics get
anything from the crime scene?

06:15.505 --> 06:16.985
Ma'am, we prefer
not to give details

06:17.072 --> 06:18.378
of our investigation
until it's compl--

06:18.465 --> 06:20.118
Agent, I was a DA for 12 years.

06:20.205 --> 06:22.294
I can pick up the phone
and find out what you've got

06:22.382 --> 06:24.949
or you can just tell me.

06:25.036 --> 06:27.561
Partial prints on the murder
weapon and Austin's blood.

06:27.648 --> 06:30.085
- We're running it now.
- Fine.

06:30.172 --> 06:32.696
You'll find that it belongs
to someone working for Tubbs.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.132
You track him

06:34.219 --> 06:36.352
you will find Abby.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.136
We'll look into Tubbs.

06:38.223 --> 06:40.530
But there are other
avenues to explore.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.880
Such as.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.100
Ma'am, as a matter of course

06:45.187 --> 06:47.581
we looked into
Abby's background.

06:47.668 --> 06:50.453
She has issues with
drug and alcohol abuse.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.107
Had issues.

06:52.194 --> 06:53.456
She's been clean for months.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.806
And what has that to do
with this situation?

06:55.893 --> 06:58.418
Parents aren't always the first
to know about a relapse

06:58.505 --> 07:00.376
and drug dealers are
dangerous company.

07:00.463 --> 07:03.118
- Abby was clean and sober.
- And Austin?

07:03.205 --> 07:05.120
He was the same.

07:05.207 --> 07:06.948
And how was their
relationship lately?

07:07.035 --> 07:09.298
It was good.

07:09.385 --> 07:12.344
There were
wounds on his face.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.259
Fingernail scratches
which suggests

07:14.346 --> 07:17.349
he had a fight with a female
shortly before he was killed.

07:21.092 --> 07:23.268
Are you suggesting..

07:23.355 --> 07:26.750
..that Abby fought with
Austin and then killed him?

07:26.837 --> 07:29.971
Like I said, ma'am,
other avenues to explore.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.714
Agent, if my
daughter comes to harm

07:33.801 --> 07:35.280
because you frittered
away your time

07:35.367 --> 07:38.153
looking into her personal
life, your career is over.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.981
Do you understand me?

07:41.417 --> 07:43.680
Ma'am, I understand
your distress

07:43.767 --> 07:45.813
during this difficult time.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.032
But we'll go wherever
this investigation takes us.

07:48.119 --> 07:49.730
It's my duty.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.168
Ah.

08:02.438 --> 08:05.223
[instrumental music]

08:09.227 --> 08:10.402
[tapping]

08:17.148 --> 08:18.628
Can I help you?

08:18.715 --> 08:21.022
Well, that depends.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.632
Who are you?

08:22.719 --> 08:24.504
- Ed Saban.
- Uh, I just..

08:24.591 --> 08:26.549
Oh. And you are?

08:26.636 --> 08:28.420
Patrick Jane, CBI.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.379
Oh, I-I spoke with
one of your colleagues.

08:30.466 --> 08:33.382
Uh...Van Pelt, I believe.

08:33.469 --> 08:35.602
Does that mean you've
had enough of questions?

08:35.689 --> 08:37.212
Uh...n-no. That-that's not--

08:37.299 --> 08:39.170
Good. Where were
you last night?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.956
Uh...here.

08:42.043 --> 08:44.741
Uh, i-i-in bed. I..

08:44.828 --> 08:48.353
I was tired from
working all day and..

08:48.440 --> 08:50.617
...took a sleeping pill.

08:50.704 --> 08:53.271
[crunching]

08:54.098 --> 08:55.230
Hmm.

08:56.361 --> 08:59.016
I'm not actually a cop.

08:59.103 --> 09:03.934
I'm what you, uh, would
refer to as a...consultant.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.196
Oh.

09:06.284 --> 09:07.982
- Funny.
- No.

09:08.069 --> 09:11.899
You have
a distinctly medical air.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.988
Are you a family doctor?

09:14.075 --> 09:18.558
Uh, Ethel's. I, uh, I took
care of her the last year or so.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.516
- Oops.
- Ethel was 93.

09:20.603 --> 09:21.909
I think, all
things considered

09:21.996 --> 09:24.868
we gave her
a reasonably peaceful end.

09:24.955 --> 09:27.392
[sniffles]
Hmm.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.177
So what do you think's
happened to Abby?

09:29.264 --> 09:31.222
Who?

09:31.309 --> 09:34.443
Abigail Fitzwilliam.
Uh, Ethel's granddaughter.

09:34.530 --> 09:37.228
Oh, Abby. Yeah.
What about her?

09:37.315 --> 09:39.100
She's missing, i-isn't she?

09:39.187 --> 09:41.581
Is she?
Do the police know?

09:43.017 --> 09:44.714
- You're joking again.
- Yes.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.237
[both laugh]

09:48.196 --> 09:49.937
How would you describe Abby?

09:50.024 --> 09:51.503
Oh, uh, uh..

09:51.591 --> 09:54.115
...a good-hearted young woman.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.901
Full of life. Vivacious.

09:57.988 --> 09:58.946
[cell phone ringing]

09:59.033 --> 10:01.949
Oh. Uh, excuse me..

10:02.036 --> 10:03.472
Um, please.

10:03.559 --> 10:05.866
Oh. Uh..

10:05.953 --> 10:07.998
[clears throat]

10:08.085 --> 10:09.217
Lisbon, hello.

10:09.304 --> 10:10.827
Jane, where are you?

10:10.914 --> 10:13.656
I'm just talking with
the family doctor here.

10:13.743 --> 10:14.831
He says our missing girl

10:14.918 --> 10:16.877
is an unstable
nymphomaniacal stoner.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.705
- Interesting, no?
- Uh, I didn't say that.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.620
Yes, you did.
You practically screamed it.

10:20.707 --> 10:21.751
I'm at the front door now.

10:21.838 --> 10:23.013
- Meet me here.
- Yeah.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.449
I-I'll be right there.

10:24.536 --> 10:25.494
Thanks for your time.

10:28.671 --> 10:29.977
- 'No sign of the girl?'
- 'No.'

10:30.064 --> 10:31.239
[Lisbon]
'And the security people say'

10:31.326 --> 10:32.588
'she couldn't have
possibly left'

10:32.675 --> 10:34.242
the property without
their knowledge.

10:34.329 --> 10:35.373
We should see
if she was sleeping

10:35.460 --> 10:36.679
with any of the security people.

10:36.766 --> 10:37.724
It's a thought.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.290
And the mom says neo-Nazis

10:39.377 --> 10:40.944
'staged a raid,
but security said'

10:41.031 --> 10:43.773
nobody came on the property,
so...puzzle that out.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.993
- Give me a minute.
- 'Cho.'

10:46.080 --> 10:47.734
Yeah, I need you to
check out Raymond Tubbs.

10:47.821 --> 10:50.040
He's in federal
prison in Folsom.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.434
Yeah, talk to him, see what he
knows about the Fitzwilliams.

10:52.521 --> 10:56.003
Also, did you get anything on
those fingerprints? Let me know.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.265
Okay. Minute's up.
What's the answer?

10:57.352 --> 10:58.440
Well, that was not a minute.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.137
That was less than
30 seconds, even.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.226
- You are something else.
- Agent Lisbon.

11:02.313 --> 11:05.403
You said that, um, if you found
anything you'd let me know.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.970
- Have you?
- No, Sophie.

11:07.057 --> 11:08.580
- I'm sorry.
- I got it.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.886
- What?
- You asked me to puzzle it out.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.018
I puzzled it out.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.497
- What? What is it?
- Uh.

11:12.584 --> 11:13.977
Well, there's been
no ransom demand

11:14.064 --> 11:15.718
so that rules out abduction.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.764
Leaves three options for
your sister's disappearance.

11:17.851 --> 11:23.117
One, she was killed and her body
was removed from the compound.

11:23.204 --> 11:26.163
Two, she was killed and her
body was hidden on the compound.

11:26.250 --> 11:30.080
Or three, she killed
Austin and fled the scene.

11:30.167 --> 11:32.126
No, that can't be.

11:32.213 --> 11:35.999
- You're hiding something.
- What? No?

11:36.086 --> 11:39.611
Obviously something about
your sister. What is it?

11:39.699 --> 11:41.265
- No.
- Oh, come on.

11:41.352 --> 11:43.006
You can tell me.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.878
You don't know Abby.

11:44.965 --> 11:47.707
- She would never hurt Austin.
- 'You want to believe that.'

11:47.794 --> 11:50.144
But you know it's
not true, don't you?

11:50.231 --> 11:53.713
You ever notice that...feeling,
that physical unwell feeling

11:53.800 --> 11:55.018
you get when you
know you should say

11:55.105 --> 11:57.064
or do something
and you don't?

11:57.151 --> 11:59.240
Heart pounds,
headache, backache.

12:00.589 --> 12:03.157
You can feel better..

12:03.244 --> 12:04.375
...immediately..

12:04.462 --> 12:06.029
...if you tell the truth..

12:07.988 --> 12:09.467
...right now.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.905
[inhales deeply]

12:11.992 --> 12:13.950
Yesterday, I went to
the guesthouse to see Abby.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.691
Mm-hmm.

12:15.778 --> 12:18.520
Austin was there,
and they were arguing.

12:18.607 --> 12:21.566
I have never seen
them like that.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.133
Abby tried to leave

12:23.220 --> 12:26.180
and Austin started
to shake her..

12:26.267 --> 12:28.660
...and he was yelling
at her and shaking her.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.793
What did Abby do?

12:30.880 --> 12:33.448
- She hit him in the face.
- Yeah.

12:33.535 --> 12:34.710
He was bleeding.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.713
Then what happened?

12:37.800 --> 12:39.410
I don't know. I left.

12:39.497 --> 12:40.455
[cell phone ringing]

12:40.542 --> 12:42.239
Excuse me.

12:42.326 --> 12:43.501
Of course.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.590
Well, thank you, Sophie.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.331
That was very valuable.

12:47.418 --> 12:48.724
Now you should take
a little lie-down

12:48.811 --> 12:50.813
maybe catch up on some sleep.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.120
[whispers]
Okay.

12:53.207 --> 12:55.383
When you wake up, you're
gonna feel a lot better.

12:57.385 --> 12:58.995
Thank you.

12:59.082 --> 13:00.780
Forensics got a match
from the prints

13:00.867 --> 13:02.738
from the knife that was
used as the murder weapon.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.218
They're Abby's.

13:09.005 --> 13:11.138
I'm telling you, Abby did
not leave that compound.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.444
You and your men searched
the house and the grounds.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.098
She wasn't there.

13:15.185 --> 13:17.405
Is it possible that
there's a hole in the system?

13:17.492 --> 13:19.711
There are cameras, regular
patrols, and motion sensors.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.061
It's just not possible.

13:21.148 --> 13:22.540
We'll have to search
the place again is all.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.891
- We must've missed her.
- First things first.

13:24.978 --> 13:27.110
Could somebody in the family
have helped Abby escape?

13:27.197 --> 13:29.199
None of them have access
to the security system.

13:29.286 --> 13:30.984
Not even Pauline.

13:31.071 --> 13:34.117
What about your men?
Are any of them vulnerabilities?

13:34.204 --> 13:36.685
They're ex-military
and law enforcement.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.861
I handpicked them myself.

13:38.948 --> 13:40.080
We're gonna need
a list of their names.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.908
You're wasting your time.

13:41.995 --> 13:43.300
You should be talking
to all the people who were

13:43.387 --> 13:45.476
onthe compoundwhen Austin was killed.

13:45.563 --> 13:49.002
We have talked to them. Six
in total, not including Abby.

13:49.089 --> 13:54.137
Pauline, Sophie, Ed Saban,
two maids, Ethel's cousin, Ruth.

13:54.224 --> 13:55.835
We're looking into all
of them, but right now

13:55.922 --> 13:58.011
what I am interested
in is finding Abby.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.537
So, Abby and Austin have
a fight and then later on

14:02.624 --> 14:03.625
that night she kills him?

14:03.712 --> 14:04.756
That's what it looks like.

14:04.844 --> 14:05.801
Still doesn't explain

14:05.888 --> 14:07.150
how she got off the estate.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.761
When we find Abby,
we'll have our answer.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.242
Whiteside sent me a list of
the names of his security team.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.462
Run background checks on them.
See if anything comes up.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.029
- Yeah, you got it.
- Hey, boss.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.944
Abby Fitzwilliam used her
credit card three hours ago

14:18.031 --> 14:19.467
at a boutique
in San Francisco.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.208
The store faxed over
an itemized receipt.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.470
Let's go check it out.

14:24.254 --> 14:26.343
"Marin Life" magazine?

14:26.430 --> 14:28.868
Mm. It's a good read.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.392
Abby liked to party,
just like the doctor said.

14:31.479 --> 14:34.830
She and her posse
are all through this.

14:34.917 --> 14:35.875
The point is..

14:35.962 --> 14:37.093
I'm exploring the world

14:37.180 --> 14:38.616
of the suspect.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.836
Well, you enjoy exploring.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.186
We'll go get on her
trail and arrest her.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.362
What did Abby
buy at the store?

14:45.449 --> 14:49.801
Um..."skirt suit, blazer,
and a Tumi bag." Why?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.803
No reason.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.850
[instrumental music]

14:54.937 --> 14:58.680
- She was in a few hours ago.
- Okay.

14:58.767 --> 15:02.945
She spent $800 on a skirt suit,
blazer, and a handbag.

15:03.032 --> 15:05.948
- Okay. Mm, uh..
- Here's her picture.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.690
Oh, yeah. I remember.
Blonder, though.

15:08.777 --> 15:10.735
- Was she with anyone?
- No.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.650
Do you remember
anything else about her?

15:12.737 --> 15:16.611
Fierce shoes.
Oh, she left an address.

15:16.698 --> 15:19.048
Jacket needed altering.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.094
Do you want it?

15:21.181 --> 15:22.312
Yes.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.362
Put your badge away.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.016
If she thinks we're
cops, she might run.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.539
I don't feel like running.

15:31.626 --> 15:32.844
[banging on door]

15:35.021 --> 15:37.632
Hi. We have a delivery
from L Couturier.

15:37.719 --> 15:40.896
- You want to open the door?
- 'She's lying.'

15:40.983 --> 15:42.332
Abby Fitzwilliam,
you're under arrest.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.507
I'm not Abby.

15:45.118 --> 15:46.989
Put your hands
in the air now!

15:47.076 --> 15:49.252
Lisbon, Grace,
where's your manners?

15:49.339 --> 15:51.994
This is Daniella,
Abby's best friend.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.996
Come in. Have a seat.

16:00.829 --> 16:03.745
[indistinct chattering]

16:05.442 --> 16:07.705
Okay. You win.
How'd you find Daniella?

16:07.792 --> 16:09.272
What's my prize?

16:09.359 --> 16:10.752
Abby Fitzwilliam
is a party girl

16:10.839 --> 16:12.493
with a rebellious streak.

16:12.580 --> 16:14.843
She dresses like one.
Lots of animal prints.

16:14.930 --> 16:17.759
- The receipt.
- Skirt suit, blazer, Tumi bag.

16:18.803 --> 16:20.109
Very East Coast prep.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.111
No way Abby would've
bought any of that.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.113
Daniella is the only one of
Abby's friends with that, uh

16:24.200 --> 16:25.549
appropriate sense of style.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.595
- How'd you find her?
- ESP.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.293
No, I had Cho
look up her address.

16:30.380 --> 16:31.338
Hmm.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.906
Why did you steal
Abby's credit card?

16:34.994 --> 16:37.213
I didn't.
She loaned it to me.

16:38.214 --> 16:40.564
She was a good friend.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.349
I have friends, Daniella.

16:42.436 --> 16:44.481
I don't loan them
my credit card.

16:44.568 --> 16:47.658
Well, what can I say?
Abby is generous.

16:47.745 --> 16:50.487
I have a job interview
in a few days.

16:50.574 --> 16:52.446
She said I needed
to look my best.

16:53.969 --> 16:56.667
She always helped me
when I needed it.

16:56.754 --> 16:59.018
Even if I said no,
she wouldn't listen.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.672
It's true. Ask around.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.196
She did it for
lots of people.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.241
When did she
give you the card?

17:05.328 --> 17:08.505
Um...three days ago.

17:08.592 --> 17:11.943
The day before
she went missing?

17:12.031 --> 17:14.076
Abby called me and told me
her grandma was really sick

17:14.163 --> 17:16.035
and that she wasn't
gonna last much longer.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.255
I went over to be with her.

17:19.342 --> 17:20.561
How'd she seem?

17:20.648 --> 17:22.041
She was sad.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.870
Crying a lot.

17:25.957 --> 17:28.047
She and her grandma
were really close.

17:31.789 --> 17:36.881
And she was drinking. It was,
it was just wine, but still.

17:36.968 --> 17:39.623
I told her I didn't
think it was a good idea.

17:39.710 --> 17:42.148
You know, she had problems
with that kind of stuff.

17:42.235 --> 17:43.627
Was Austin there?

17:43.714 --> 17:46.326
Abby wouldn't have
been drinking if he was.

17:46.413 --> 17:48.284
Austin's totally
straight-edged.

17:48.371 --> 17:50.069
He got her sober.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.636
The night Abby went
missing, where were you?

17:52.723 --> 17:54.290
In LA for work.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.641
Boss, need you out here.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.868
I said Mr. Jane.
I want to talk to Mr. Jane.

18:06.955 --> 18:08.348
- Where is he?
- I turned my back for a second.

18:08.435 --> 18:09.523
You know how he is.

18:09.610 --> 18:10.915
He's not here right now, Sophie.

18:11.002 --> 18:12.308
What's the problem?

18:12.395 --> 18:15.137
I, um, I got this message.

18:15.224 --> 18:16.617
I don't know what it means.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.619
What message?
What are you talking about?

18:18.706 --> 18:20.099
[man on phone]
'Tell your bitch mom
that's what she gets'

18:20.186 --> 18:22.057
'for messing
with Raymond Tubbs.'

18:22.144 --> 18:24.233
'Your sister and her friend
were just the beginning.'

18:24.320 --> 18:27.367
'You will reap the whirlwind.
Eight, eight!'

18:27.454 --> 18:29.630
I've never heard
that voice before.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.066
"Eight, eight."
What does that mean?

18:31.153 --> 18:32.589
It's a code used
by white supremacists.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.461
The eighth letter
of the alphabet. H, H.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.202
- HeilHitler.
- It's blocked.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.160
Sophie, we're gonna need
your phone for a little while.

18:38.247 --> 18:39.205
- Get a trace on it.
- Yeah, you got it.

18:39.292 --> 18:40.684
You said Abby did this.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.643
You said her fingerprint
was on the knife.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.166
We don't know
what this means

18:44.253 --> 18:45.689
but right now you
shouldn't be alone.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.561
I'm gonna have
an agent bring you home.

18:47.648 --> 18:50.346
What about Abby? Did these
people do something to her?

18:50.433 --> 18:51.913
That's what we're gonna
find out. Come with me.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.132
Okay.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.224
[buzzes]

19:00.226 --> 19:01.836
Raymond Tubbs?

19:01.923 --> 19:03.359
Yeah. Who are you?

19:03.446 --> 19:05.927
I'm Agent Cho from the CBI.

19:06.014 --> 19:06.971
I'd like to ask
you a few questions

19:07.058 --> 19:08.234
about Pauline Fitzwilliam.

19:08.321 --> 19:09.844
[sighs]

19:09.931 --> 19:11.454
What about her?

19:11.541 --> 19:13.239
A man was killed on
the Fitzwilliam compound.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.197
A family member is missing.

19:15.284 --> 19:18.287
Another family member
received a voice mail.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.985
It said, "That's what you get
for messing with Raymond Tubbs."

19:21.072 --> 19:23.031
[sighs]

19:23.118 --> 19:24.859
Leadership's a bitch, huh?

19:24.946 --> 19:26.426
You try to keep
your folks on point

19:26.513 --> 19:29.646
and then some darn
fool opens his mouth.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.996
Where you hail from, Agent Cho?

19:32.083 --> 19:33.737
Oakland.

19:33.824 --> 19:35.783
[sighs]
Okay.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.611
- Where are your parents from?
- Korea.

19:37.698 --> 19:41.136
Koreans. Good people.
Know who they are.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.921
A lot of people today don't
know who the heck they are.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.967
A man without
knowledge of his roots

19:46.054 --> 19:47.751
is like a cabbage
in this society.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.492
That's true.

19:49.579 --> 19:50.972
So you deny any
connection to the incidents

19:51.059 --> 19:52.016
at the Fitzwilliam compound?

19:52.103 --> 19:53.192
Heck, no.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.889
There's an Aryan
soldier who honors

19:54.976 --> 19:56.543
and respects me
inside the compound.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.719
He carried out
the mission for me.

19:58.806 --> 20:01.069
I'm just saying I wouldn't
call anyone about it.

20:01.156 --> 20:02.766
That's just dumb.

20:02.853 --> 20:05.116
But I guess there's
a dummy in any group.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.249
Right,Agent Cho?

20:07.336 --> 20:10.078
[intense music]

20:10.165 --> 20:13.081
[instrumental music]

20:19.043 --> 20:20.393
Mr. Jane, may I ask--

20:20.480 --> 20:23.265
Marcus, if I wanted
to break into this compound

20:23.352 --> 20:25.398
where would be
the best place to do it?

20:25.485 --> 20:28.618
- Excuse me?
- Where's the weak link?

20:28.705 --> 20:31.839
This property
is 100% secure.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.362
When you learned
someone had been murdered

20:33.449 --> 20:35.495
in the guesthouse, something
popped into your mind.

20:35.582 --> 20:38.759
An image of a location you've
been worried about, a weakness.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.543
What was it?

20:40.630 --> 20:42.241
- No.
- Yes.

20:44.721 --> 20:47.420
- It's nothing, but, uh..
- Go on.

20:47.507 --> 20:49.117
North wall.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.771
Property bends
around a gully.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.251
Curve in the wall makes
it hard for the sensors

20:52.338 --> 20:54.253
to pick up movement.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.516
Okay.

20:58.866 --> 21:00.084
You'll need to go
through the gate.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.304
Okay. Of course.

21:05.089 --> 21:07.091
This Aryan soldier,
give me a name.

21:07.178 --> 21:10.094
Yeah. No.
Why would I do that?

21:10.181 --> 21:11.835
You've had your revenge already.

21:11.922 --> 21:14.273
Why not give up your man?

21:14.360 --> 21:15.839
Life could be a lot
easier for you in here

21:15.926 --> 21:17.624
if we tell the warden
you're helping us out.

21:17.711 --> 21:19.321
Extra smokes, more yard time?

21:19.408 --> 21:22.106
Yeah. Like that.
Flat screen TV maybe.

21:22.193 --> 21:26.328
You don't understand. There's
honoramong us race warriors.

21:26.415 --> 21:27.721
'Loyalty.'

21:27.808 --> 21:29.462
'Brotherhood.'

21:29.549 --> 21:31.420
Yeah, right.

21:31.507 --> 21:34.162
What do you mean,
"Yeah, right?"

21:34.249 --> 21:35.598
It means you're
wasting my time.

21:35.685 --> 21:36.991
You have no one
inside the compound.

21:37.078 --> 21:38.645
There are no Aryan
warriors out there

21:38.732 --> 21:40.995
'awaiting your orders.'

21:41.082 --> 21:42.736
You're a sad little
man alone in a box

21:42.823 --> 21:44.955
living on delusions
of grandeur.

21:45.042 --> 21:47.306
You are 100% wrong.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.873
I got an army behind me.
An army.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.267
And I got a guy inside.

21:52.354 --> 21:55.139
- 'No, you don't.'
- Hey, wait a minute!

21:55.226 --> 21:57.228
Howard Dressler is his name.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.753
Myguy.Inside.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.146
So choke on that, Cho.

22:02.233 --> 22:03.278
Thanks.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.497
HeilHitler.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.368
[bangs on table]

22:06.455 --> 22:07.804
[Velcro rips]

22:07.891 --> 22:09.850
Blood pressure's still high.

22:09.937 --> 22:11.504
So is your heart rate.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.593
I'm gonna give you a Xanax
to help calm you down.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.769
I don't want any
medication. Not today.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.251
Any word on Abby?

22:20.339 --> 22:21.340
No.

22:22.993 --> 22:25.909
Then if you'll excuse me
my mother's funeral

22:25.996 --> 22:29.391
is this afternoon, and I really
need to finish her eulogy.

22:29.478 --> 22:31.350
- I'll come back later.
- Thank you, Ed.

22:39.096 --> 22:41.534
So you're holding
the service here?

22:41.621 --> 22:44.319
Yes. She's being buried on
the property beside my father.

22:44.406 --> 22:46.582
Surprising you're
going ahead with it.

22:46.669 --> 22:49.106
Given recent events.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.937
What would you
have me do, Mr. Jane?

22:54.024 --> 22:56.723
I'm sorry if I'm not behaving
the way you think I should.

22:56.810 --> 22:58.202
It's not every day
my mother dies

22:58.289 --> 23:01.467
and my daughter goes missing.

23:01.554 --> 23:03.294
Now if there's..

23:03.382 --> 23:04.992
...anything else you need?

23:07.429 --> 23:08.430
No.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.345
Good.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.347
Because I really
mustfinish this.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.088
By all means.

23:17.700 --> 23:18.962
Hmm.

23:21.356 --> 23:23.314
That's a beautiful rug.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.968
- Thank you.
- It's very nice.

23:25.055 --> 23:30.147
Held up well...especially
having kids in the house.

23:30.234 --> 23:32.411
That's because I never
let the girls play on it.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.805
You said that.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.807
But Abby didn't
listen to you, did she?

23:40.114 --> 23:41.985
No.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.552
Whatever she was told not to do

23:43.639 --> 23:45.598
that's exactly
what she would do.

23:45.685 --> 23:47.556
Always contrary.

23:47.643 --> 23:50.733
Hard for someone like
you to handle, I imagine.

23:50.820 --> 23:52.605
Someone like me?

23:52.692 --> 23:54.781
Disciplined. Rigorous.

23:56.086 --> 23:58.611
Wound. You are wound.

23:59.525 --> 24:01.091
It wasn't all bad.

24:03.398 --> 24:05.313
She's a beautiful girl.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.621
She's strong and funny..

24:10.710 --> 24:14.801
...and we'd grown apart
these past few years because..

24:14.888 --> 24:17.064
Well, ever since
my husband died

24:17.151 --> 24:20.415
but even so, there were times
when Abby and I were together

24:20.502 --> 24:22.199
and it was as if
she were a girl again.

24:22.286 --> 24:24.637
And...we were happy.

24:29.380 --> 24:31.382
She's dead, isn't she?

24:32.514 --> 24:34.473
My daughter's dead.

24:36.823 --> 24:38.694
It's not unlikely.

24:42.742 --> 24:44.047
Excuse me.

24:52.665 --> 24:53.753
What's this?

24:53.840 --> 24:55.450
Visitor logs from
the security team.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.278
Every person who entered
and left the compound

24:57.365 --> 24:58.714
over the last three months.

24:58.801 --> 25:01.587
Lisbon wants us
to look through 'em.

25:01.674 --> 25:02.892
Raymond Tubbs
said he had a man

25:02.979 --> 25:05.025
named Howard Dressler
inside the compound.

25:08.376 --> 25:10.247
Is that new?

25:10.334 --> 25:12.119
Oh. Yes.

25:13.816 --> 25:15.644
- 'It's a gift?'
- Uh-huh.

25:17.428 --> 25:19.518
From O'Laughlin, huh?

25:19.605 --> 25:20.562
Uh-huh.

25:20.649 --> 25:22.303
He has good taste.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.391
Thanks.

25:25.219 --> 25:26.829
What was that name again?

25:26.916 --> 25:29.571
Uh, Howard Dressler.

25:29.658 --> 25:31.660
- Got him.
- Nice.

25:34.054 --> 25:36.839
[instrumental music]

25:56.163 --> 25:57.077
[cell phone ringing]

25:58.687 --> 26:00.297
- What's up?
- 'We found Howard Dressler.'

26:00.384 --> 26:01.690
[Grace]
'He tried to run,
but we caught him.'

26:01.777 --> 26:03.213
'We're gonna take him
in now for questioning.'

26:03.300 --> 26:06.216
Nice work. I'll call
you back. What's going on?

26:06.303 --> 26:07.566
Perimeter sensor's
been tripped.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.437
Someone's trying to
break onto the compound.

26:09.524 --> 26:10.481
We're on our way.

26:11.831 --> 26:13.615
CBI! Don't move.

26:13.702 --> 26:15.574
Turn around slowly
with your hands up.

26:19.186 --> 26:20.230
Jane?

26:20.317 --> 26:21.797
Hey, Lisbon.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.756
When did you get here?

26:27.890 --> 26:30.197
[instrumental music]

26:33.069 --> 26:35.245
Hey, hey, hey. Jane.

26:36.377 --> 26:38.466
How are you guys doing today?

26:39.859 --> 26:42.426
I, myself..

26:42.513 --> 26:45.299
...am having a great day.

26:45.386 --> 26:48.345
I got a call from
a Pauline Fitzwilliam

26:49.477 --> 26:53.524
a Federal Judge...Fitzwilliam..

26:53.612 --> 26:55.309
...saying that
a CBI consultant

26:55.396 --> 26:58.791
was caught stealing
a rug from her residence.

26:58.878 --> 27:01.707
- Ma'am, I sincerely apologize--
- Oh, hush, Lisbon.

27:01.794 --> 27:04.666
There's no reason to apologize.
I was working the case.

27:04.753 --> 27:05.885
The rug was a stand-in corpse.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.451
I just wanted to see
if it was possible

27:07.538 --> 27:10.237
for the killer to leave
the compound with Abby's body.

27:10.324 --> 27:12.282
And is it possible?

27:12.369 --> 27:14.371
Not unless the culprit
was a mountain gorilla.

27:18.071 --> 27:21.683
So now you've had your
fun, to no useful end

27:21.770 --> 27:23.946
and now she's asking me
to remove you from the case.

27:24.033 --> 27:26.688
Is there any reason why
I shouldn't do as she asks?

27:30.213 --> 27:32.259
[sighs]

27:32.346 --> 27:33.956
She's a suspect.

27:37.220 --> 27:38.482
Really?

27:38.569 --> 27:41.094
She hasn't been
excluded, has she?

27:41.181 --> 27:43.270
Then she's still a suspect..

27:43.357 --> 27:46.490
...and it would look bad to be
seen allowing a murder suspect

27:46.577 --> 27:49.624
dictate the terms
of an investigation.

27:49.711 --> 27:50.973
Right?

27:52.235 --> 27:54.324
Is this true, Lisbon?

27:54.411 --> 27:56.283
Is she a suspect?

27:56.370 --> 27:59.808
She has not been excluded.

27:59.895 --> 28:01.418
Okay.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.638
I'll give you some more rope.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.684
Don't hang yourself with it.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.295
And, you know,
next time call me..

28:08.382 --> 28:09.992
...when you want to do
some more foolishness.

28:10.079 --> 28:11.690
"Foolishness," I think,
is a little harsh--

28:11.777 --> 28:13.909
- Go.
- Okay, I'm leaving.

28:14.780 --> 28:15.998
I have your numbers.

28:19.132 --> 28:21.482
Come on, Howard.
Don't lie to me.

28:21.569 --> 28:23.919
Already spoke to Raymond Tubbs.

28:24.006 --> 28:26.226
Raymond Tubbs?

28:26.313 --> 28:27.357
What about him?

28:27.444 --> 28:29.446
Well, you tell me.

28:29.533 --> 28:31.100
He's an American patriot.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.538
I subscribe to some
of his newsletters.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.366
There's no crime in that.

28:36.453 --> 28:39.456
Well, Tubbs says you're his guy
inside the Fitzwilliam compound.

28:39.543 --> 28:41.284
Says that
you're the, uh

28:41.371 --> 28:43.939
"Aryan warrior that avenged
his unjust imprisonment.

28:44.026 --> 28:45.201
- Killed Austin Marr."
- Whoa.

28:45.288 --> 28:46.681
I had nothing
to do with that.

28:46.768 --> 28:48.596
Okay. If you say so.

28:48.683 --> 28:50.119
But you can see
how it looks.

28:50.206 --> 28:52.643
- Not good.
- No, no, no.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.472
I keep my business and my
politics totally separate.

28:55.559 --> 28:56.952
Oh, The Third Reich
Pool Cleaning Company

28:57.039 --> 28:58.954
doesn't play so good, huh?

28:59.041 --> 29:00.695
[sighs]

29:00.782 --> 29:02.697
I've exchanged a few
e-mails with Tubbs.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.613
That's all. If he says
any different, he's lying.

29:10.531 --> 29:12.925
I got immunity for what
I say in here, right?

29:13.012 --> 29:14.317
No.

29:16.885 --> 29:17.843
Okay.

29:17.930 --> 29:20.497
Occasionally..

29:20.584 --> 29:22.586
...I got stuff for Abby.

29:22.673 --> 29:25.938
Stuff? You sold her drugs?

29:26.025 --> 29:28.592
A little coke. Some meth.

29:28.679 --> 29:30.464
When was the last time
you scored for her?

29:30.551 --> 29:31.813
Not for a couple of months

29:31.900 --> 29:33.772
but then the other
day she hit me up.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.469
She was in a real bad way.

29:35.556 --> 29:39.386
She asked me for...an eight
ball and some downers.

29:39.473 --> 29:42.476
It took me a few days,
but I got 'em.

29:42.563 --> 29:44.304
But the morning I showed up,
there was cops everywhere.

29:44.391 --> 29:46.262
I didn't even get
to give 'em to her.

29:48.003 --> 29:51.006
Look, I know I screwed up,
but I didn't kill Austin.

29:52.921 --> 29:55.315
There was a useful
end, by the way.

29:55.402 --> 29:58.231
We now know for sure that nobody
entered or left the property

29:58.318 --> 30:00.059
the night of the murder,
so she must've been murdered

30:00.146 --> 30:02.061
in the guest room
along with Austin.

30:02.148 --> 30:04.759
- Then the killer hid her body.
- We searched.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.065
She's not on the compound.

30:06.152 --> 30:07.762
You searched for
a living, breathing woman

30:07.849 --> 30:09.546
and not a dead body,
big difference.

30:09.633 --> 30:11.461
Why would the killer
hide one victim

30:11.548 --> 30:12.549
and leave
the other one behind?

30:12.636 --> 30:14.551
Good question.

30:14.638 --> 30:15.639
We'll search
the property again.

30:15.726 --> 30:16.902
This time we'll
get cadaver dogs

30:16.989 --> 30:19.339
and more personnel.

30:19.426 --> 30:21.732
No need. I know exactly
where the body is hidden.

30:23.430 --> 30:26.085
- Wait. What are you gonna do?
- Just talk.

30:26.172 --> 30:27.521
But they're in
the middle of the funeral.

30:27.608 --> 30:29.915
You can't just walk
in there willy-nilly.

30:30.002 --> 30:32.526
- Yeah. That's right.
- Thank you.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.963
- I forgot to call Hightower.
- Hightower? Why?

30:36.530 --> 30:37.531
Voice mail.

30:37.618 --> 30:39.098
Hey, Hightower.
It's Jane.

30:39.185 --> 30:41.404
Just wanted to let you know
that, uh, there's gonna be

30:41.491 --> 30:43.232
what you like to call
"foolishness" going on

30:43.319 --> 30:45.017
at Ethel Sebring's funeral.

30:45.104 --> 30:46.975
That's it.
Have a great day.

30:48.281 --> 30:50.849
She told me to call.

30:50.936 --> 30:53.199
- Better hurry.
- Jane.

30:53.286 --> 30:54.200
Jane.

30:55.201 --> 30:57.029
"God, our Father..

30:57.116 --> 30:59.422
"...your power
brings us to birth.

30:59.509 --> 31:02.164
'"Your providence
guides our lives..'

31:02.251 --> 31:05.515
"...and by your command,
we return to dust.

31:05.602 --> 31:07.343
"Unite us together in one family

31:07.430 --> 31:11.173
to sing your praise
forever and ever, amen."

31:11.260 --> 31:13.697
In the name
of the Father and of the Son

31:13.784 --> 31:16.265
'and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.'

31:16.352 --> 31:18.267
Amen. Thank you, father.

31:18.354 --> 31:19.834
Uh, good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

31:19.921 --> 31:21.270
My name is Patrick Jane.

31:21.357 --> 31:22.532
For those of you
who don't know me

31:22.619 --> 31:25.666
I am a consultant with the CBI.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.059
I know that
you're all here today

31:27.146 --> 31:30.105
to mourn the loss
of Ethel Sebring.

31:30.192 --> 31:32.064
But I have a very
important announcement

31:32.151 --> 31:33.587
that simply can't wait.

31:33.674 --> 31:34.675
What is the meaning of this?

31:34.762 --> 31:36.068
Uh, just bear with me, please

31:36.155 --> 31:37.721
for one moment.

31:37.808 --> 31:39.549
'Well, there's no
easy way to say this'

31:39.636 --> 31:41.943
so I'm just gonna come
straight out with it.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.119
Abby Fitzwilliam is dead.

31:44.206 --> 31:46.382
- No.
- Yeah, it's true, Sophie.

31:46.469 --> 31:48.907
I'm very sorry for your loss.

31:48.994 --> 31:50.647
[sobbing]

31:50.734 --> 31:52.127
How?

31:52.214 --> 31:53.868
We don't know all
the details as yet

31:53.955 --> 31:56.001
but we will know very soon.

31:57.567 --> 31:58.873
Where is she?

32:03.747 --> 32:05.793
[Jane]
'She's hidden in your
grandmother's casket.'

32:05.880 --> 32:07.664
[indistinct chattering]

32:07.751 --> 32:08.796
It's quite clever, actually.

32:08.883 --> 32:09.840
It's...it's one place

32:09.928 --> 32:11.581
you wouldn't look for a body

32:11.668 --> 32:14.933
other than the obvious...
exception, of course.

32:15.020 --> 32:17.631
Are you playing some
sort of demented joke?

32:17.718 --> 32:19.154
I wish I could say I was.

32:19.241 --> 32:20.460
Uh..

32:21.722 --> 32:23.550
They were both small women.

32:23.637 --> 32:26.814
They could fit comfortably
together in this box.

32:26.901 --> 32:30.861
The only way we can tell
for sure...is if we, uh..

32:35.257 --> 32:37.433
Well, we're gonna have
to take a quick peek.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.088
'Um, w-we will do it inside.'

32:40.175 --> 32:43.483
Uh, Dr. Saban will
oversee proceedings

32:43.570 --> 32:46.181
to make sure that
everything is shipshape.

32:46.268 --> 32:49.184
Agent, have you no
control over this buffoon?

32:49.271 --> 32:51.230
Lisbon, trust me. You
gotta trust me on this one.

32:54.233 --> 32:56.539
Mr. Jane is making
a valid point.

32:56.626 --> 32:58.324
Ma'am, you know more
about the law than we do.

32:58.411 --> 33:00.543
We can get a warrant, but..

33:00.630 --> 33:03.372
...I think this will be
quicker and less intrusive..

33:04.591 --> 33:06.462
...with all due respect.

33:11.119 --> 33:13.295
Checking the perimeter now.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.907
- This is wrong.
- Oh, please.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.997
Ethel was dignified in life.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.911
She'd want to
remain so in death.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.696
Doctor, you of all people,
should know there's nothing

33:22.783 --> 33:24.263
dignified about death.

33:24.350 --> 33:26.265
What's going on?

33:26.352 --> 33:28.832
Oh. You got my message?

33:28.919 --> 33:30.878
Ma'am, everything
is under control.

33:30.965 --> 33:32.184
What's he doing to that casket?

33:32.271 --> 33:33.837
Well, that's what
I was calling you about.

33:33.924 --> 33:34.969
Opening it.

33:35.056 --> 33:36.275
Jane says that
Abby Fitzwilliam's

33:36.362 --> 33:37.798
body is in the casket.

33:37.885 --> 33:39.278
Oh, my God.

33:39.365 --> 33:41.454
Have you gone completely insane?

33:41.541 --> 33:43.586
No, I don't think so.

33:43.673 --> 33:46.894
[Dr. Saban]
There we go.

33:46.981 --> 33:48.765
Pauline, are you sure
you wanna do this?

33:48.852 --> 33:50.550
Just get it over with.

33:58.123 --> 33:59.167
What?

33:59.254 --> 34:00.386
Oh.

34:01.691 --> 34:02.953
Oh, no.

34:09.786 --> 34:10.744
Oh.

34:10.831 --> 34:11.788
[thwacks]

34:23.409 --> 34:25.976
The guests have been sent home.
The funeral's been postponed.

34:26.064 --> 34:29.110
- I hope you're happy.
- Oh, it doesn't make sense.

34:29.197 --> 34:31.460
Abby's body is
not in this coffin.

34:31.547 --> 34:33.506
- You promised me.
- Yeah, I thought she was.

34:33.593 --> 34:35.551
I was certain that
she was in there.

34:35.638 --> 34:37.162
Well, you were wrong.

34:37.249 --> 34:38.859
Well, it doesn't make
sense that I was wrong.

34:38.946 --> 34:40.426
Stop saying that.

34:40.513 --> 34:42.297
But this is the perfect
place to hide the body.

34:42.384 --> 34:44.517
It's the one place that
no one would think to look.

34:44.604 --> 34:46.867
- Jane, that's enough.
- No, we..

34:46.954 --> 34:48.738
She's on this compound.
I know that.

34:48.825 --> 34:49.783
I know that she's
on this compound.

34:49.870 --> 34:50.914
Jane.

34:51.001 --> 34:52.264
We need to get the sniffer dogs

34:52.351 --> 34:53.961
and the helicopters and..

34:54.048 --> 34:57.573
'Cause she is here.
I am so sorry.

34:57.660 --> 34:59.445
[whispers]
Sorry.

34:59.532 --> 35:02.404
Okay. Alright. Um..

35:02.491 --> 35:05.451
At first light tomorrow,
I want you to start

35:05.538 --> 35:08.323
a comprehensive
search for Abby's body.

35:08.410 --> 35:11.326
If she's here...find her.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.287
[sighs]

35:17.115 --> 35:18.768
She's here.

35:18.855 --> 35:20.509
Lisbon, what were you thinking?

35:20.596 --> 35:22.946
It was...no excuses, ma'am.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.774
He asked me to
trust him, and I did.

35:24.861 --> 35:26.907
Your job is not to trust him.

35:26.994 --> 35:29.562
Your job is to trust
yourjudgment, not his.

35:31.694 --> 35:33.348
That poor woman
was in the ground.

35:33.435 --> 35:35.524
Not in the ground,
but on her way.

35:35.611 --> 35:36.960
I mean, aren't
we all on our way?

35:37.047 --> 35:39.615
You have messed with
the funeral of a High Court

35:39.702 --> 35:41.748
judge's mother on
the very day she finds out

35:41.835 --> 35:44.664
that her daughter
is most likely dead.

35:44.751 --> 35:48.624
That is a very bad
career move for all of us.

35:51.018 --> 35:53.020
Sorry, if I got
you guys into trouble.

35:53.107 --> 35:55.240
- I made a mistake.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Say that again.

35:55.327 --> 35:58.373
I made a mistake. I said it
twice. I won't say it again.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.680
Because it just now occurs to
me that perhaps I'll be proven

36:00.767 --> 36:02.682
not quite as wrong as I appear
to be in this very moment.

36:02.769 --> 36:05.075
- Is that right?
- Yes. In fact, I'm sure of it.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.295
So don't worry.
Your careers are safe.

36:07.382 --> 36:08.949
Judge Fitzwilliam
will change her tune

36:09.036 --> 36:10.385
once I reveal her
daughter's killer.

36:10.472 --> 36:13.214
- Won't she?
- I imagine she will.

36:13.301 --> 36:14.607
When do you plan
on doing that?

36:14.694 --> 36:16.609
- This very evening.
- This very night?

36:16.696 --> 36:18.350
- But you have to trust me.
- Right.

36:18.437 --> 36:19.786
And what if
you're wrong again?

36:19.873 --> 36:21.614
Well, if I'm wrong,
then we're in deep trouble.

36:21.701 --> 36:23.398
But what are
the chances, really

36:23.485 --> 36:25.531
'of me being wrong
twice in a row?'

36:25.618 --> 36:28.316
Think about that one.

36:28.403 --> 36:30.797
Of course, if either
of you have a better idea

36:30.884 --> 36:33.278
how to find Abby's body
and catch her killer

36:33.365 --> 36:35.062
please, these
are not taxi doors.

36:35.149 --> 36:36.977
They're ears.

36:48.684 --> 36:50.120
[breathing loudly]

36:51.818 --> 36:53.820
[whispering]
It's not gonna work
unless you're quiet.

36:53.907 --> 36:57.693
[whispering]
I can't keep quiet.
My legs are asleep.

36:57.780 --> 36:58.868
[sighs]

37:00.435 --> 37:03.525
What do you mean,
your legs are asleep?

37:03.612 --> 37:05.397
Legs don't sleep.

37:05.484 --> 37:07.834
It's absurd. I don't
know why people say that.

37:09.444 --> 37:11.011
[door opening]

37:36.732 --> 37:39.257
[intense music]

37:50.920 --> 37:52.095
[cell phone ringing]

37:52.182 --> 37:53.880
[whispering]
Oh, damn.

37:53.967 --> 37:55.360
[ringing continues]

38:00.060 --> 38:01.191
[ringing continues]

38:02.192 --> 38:03.368
[whispers]
Damn.

38:03.455 --> 38:04.586
[ringing continues]

38:06.284 --> 38:08.155
[whispers]
Where the hell is it?

38:09.330 --> 38:10.810
[ringing continues]

38:18.513 --> 38:19.993
[ringing continues]

38:26.869 --> 38:27.827
[beeps]

38:30.133 --> 38:31.309
Hello.

38:31.396 --> 38:33.528
[Jane]
'What's up, doc?'

38:33.615 --> 38:35.487
Put your hands in the air!

38:36.879 --> 38:38.751
Sorry. Did we scare you?

38:42.494 --> 38:46.149
You hid Abby's body and not
Austin's because you had to.

38:46.236 --> 38:49.501
Evidence of your
guilt was inside Abby.

38:49.588 --> 38:52.460
Come on. We both know
the autopsy will confirm it.

38:52.547 --> 38:54.462
You were giving Abby drugs.

38:59.380 --> 39:01.904
A few days before Ethel died..

39:01.991 --> 39:04.559
...Abby relapsed.

39:04.646 --> 39:07.170
[Dr. Saban]
She was an addict.

39:07.257 --> 39:08.737
She was either
gonna get her drugs

39:08.824 --> 39:10.913
from me or from the street.

39:12.872 --> 39:14.830
I was managing her addiction.

39:16.702 --> 39:19.487
It's recognized
therapeutic practice.

39:19.574 --> 39:21.489
For which you were paid.

39:21.576 --> 39:23.883
Well, yes, of course.
I'm a doctor.

39:23.970 --> 39:27.495
[Lisbon]
Of course. So you weren't
doing it to help Abby out.

39:27.582 --> 39:29.932
You were doing it for the money.

39:30.019 --> 39:32.370
With Ethel dying, you needed
a new source of income.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.763
[Lisbon]
Then along came Abby,
a rich, young addict.

39:35.938 --> 39:38.245
[Abby moaning]

39:38.332 --> 39:40.465
Abby, it's okay. You're okay.

39:40.552 --> 39:41.509
[Abby moaning]

39:41.596 --> 39:44.469
'You're okay. Abby.'

39:44.556 --> 39:47.602
Abby. Abby.
Ab-Ab-Abby, stay with me.

39:49.125 --> 39:51.301
She OD'ed so fast.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.303
I couldn't save her.

39:56.263 --> 39:59.179
- Austin came back.
- What's going on?

39:59.266 --> 40:01.181
[Dr. Saban]
Saw what had happened.

40:01.268 --> 40:02.400
W-what'd you do to her?

40:02.487 --> 40:04.793
He was gonna go to the police.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.099
Turn me in.

40:09.885 --> 40:11.234
My whole life was over

40:11.321 --> 40:14.107
if he made that call.

40:14.194 --> 40:15.674
I picked up the knife..

40:15.761 --> 40:18.198
...just to stop him,
not to hurt him.

40:20.505 --> 40:23.464
I wasn't thinking.

40:23.551 --> 40:25.945
Ah!

40:26.032 --> 40:29.383
I figured if I made it
look like Abby did it..

40:31.211 --> 40:32.995
...people would believe it.

40:37.913 --> 40:39.524
I knew if they
found Abby's body

40:39.611 --> 40:41.700
they'd find the drugs
in her system.

40:42.962 --> 40:45.007
So I hid her in my room

40:45.094 --> 40:46.922
in the closet.

40:47.009 --> 40:50.491
I was so scared when the police
came to search the house.

40:50.578 --> 40:53.755
I was sure they'd find her.

40:53.842 --> 40:56.062
You took advantage of Abby.

40:56.149 --> 40:57.846
She trusted you,
and you preyed on her

40:57.933 --> 41:00.849
in her weakest moment.

41:00.936 --> 41:02.851
She never had a chance.

41:02.938 --> 41:05.811
[instrumental music]

41:08.596 --> 41:11.033
[footsteps approaching]

41:11.120 --> 41:14.167
- Hey.
- Mmm.

41:14.254 --> 41:16.386
So I just talked
to Judge Fitzwilliam.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.823
And?

41:17.910 --> 41:20.216
And she says that
if you will apologize

41:20.303 --> 41:22.044
for the cavalier
manner with which you

41:22.131 --> 41:25.657
disrupted her mother's
burial, she will not pursue

41:25.744 --> 41:27.615
disciplinary action against you

41:27.702 --> 41:30.052
or Lisbon or myself.

41:30.139 --> 41:31.140
Hmm.

41:31.227 --> 41:32.751
Tell her, Jane says

41:32.838 --> 41:34.274
she's a self-righteous

41:34.361 --> 41:36.450
embittered old bat
and she should thank me.

41:36.537 --> 41:38.496
Oh, God, Jane, please.

41:38.583 --> 41:40.280
[Pauline]
'You're right, Mr. Jane.'

41:42.456 --> 41:45.807
I came here for an apology.

41:45.894 --> 41:48.723
But I realize now I was
wrong to stand on my dignity.

41:50.899 --> 41:51.987
'I am embittered.'

41:53.249 --> 41:55.730
And your
arrogant, callous

41:55.817 --> 41:57.123
'juvenile behavior did'

41:57.210 --> 42:00.648
reveal the truth
after all, so..

42:00.735 --> 42:02.476
...thank you.

42:02.563 --> 42:03.695
'Thank you very much.'

42:05.610 --> 42:06.698
Good evening to you.

42:06.785 --> 42:08.221
Good evening.

42:11.964 --> 42:12.878
Sorry.

42:17.143 --> 42:19.275
Okay, then.

42:19.362 --> 42:21.887
[sighs]
Everyone's happy.
