Previously
on "Future Man":

00:06.094 --> 00:08.473
There's a power in you
greater than any

00:08.474 --> 00:10.603
we've ever seen.
Welcome to the Pointed Circle.

00:10.604 --> 00:12.105
'Cause this procedure
will 100% kill him.

00:12.106 --> 00:13.107
Kill him?

00:15.196 --> 00:16.364
Hachi machi.

00:16.365 --> 00:17.992
You used my biotic DNA

00:17.993 --> 00:19.328
to create the cure.

00:19.329 --> 00:20.748
Made it so I
destroyed humanity.

00:20.749 --> 00:22.167
No, you saved it.

00:22.168 --> 00:23.419
I still don't know
who I am,

00:23.420 --> 00:25.131
or how I got this way.

00:25.132 --> 00:26.760
I'm alone.

00:26.761 --> 00:28.137
Well, that's where you're wrong.

00:28.138 --> 00:29.933
Tiger, Ty-Anne, my daughter.

00:29.934 --> 00:31.394
Hi.

00:31.395 --> 00:33.649
- Here he is.
- Welcome back, Torque.

00:33.650 --> 00:35.235
Which one of you cats
am I married to?

00:35.236 --> 00:37.072
What did I say?
Who did I offend?

00:37.073 --> 00:38.491
It's all of us, Torque.

00:38.492 --> 00:40.161
You leaving again,
Papa Torque?

00:40.162 --> 00:42.457
I was just going out
to check on something,

00:42.458 --> 00:44.796
but it can wait.

Oh!

02:34.224 --> 02:36.310
The fuck am I?

02:43.910 --> 02:45.913
It's so hot.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.173
Water plant?

02:59.775 --> 03:01.361
Yeah.

03:18.061 --> 03:20.023
The water table!

03:25.326 --> 03:26.703
Fuck, who am I kidding?

03:41.525 --> 03:43.654
Come on, it's just pee.

03:43.655 --> 03:46.158
Oh, shit.
God damn it.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.787
This is life or death.
This is life or death.

03:47.788 --> 03:49.122
People do this all the time,
all right?

03:49.123 --> 03:51.001
This is--this is
"127 Hours,"

03:51.002 --> 03:52.880
this is those--
those Chilean miners.

03:52.881 --> 03:54.132
Okay, uh, who else?

03:54.133 --> 03:55.886
No!

03:55.887 --> 03:57.472
No, no, no!
Please, no!

03:57.473 --> 03:59.101
No, no, no!

03:59.102 --> 04:01.397
No!

04:12.879 --> 04:16.970
Come on.

04:23.150 --> 04:25.571
I have one question,
and just one question only.

04:25.572 --> 04:28.367
Robot or clone?

04:28.368 --> 04:30.121
- Honey--
- One of them's gonna make me

04:30.122 --> 04:31.498
really angry,

04:31.499 --> 04:33.377
and the other one's
gonna be fine.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.177
I don't care anymore.

04:37.178 --> 04:38.722
Okay, so if you didn't
sign anything,

04:38.723 --> 04:40.308
you're free to go.

04:40.309 --> 04:42.730
I hereby release you!

04:42.731 --> 04:43.982
Go.

04:46.362 --> 04:48.324
If you wanted to impress me,

04:48.325 --> 04:51.246
you should've just gotten
a motorcycle,

04:51.247 --> 04:53.292
and then just drove it
off a cliff.

04:55.297 --> 05:00.599
Just kidding.
I love you, Daaaaaaa!

05:00.600 --> 05:02.477
And...

05:02.478 --> 05:03.814
There it is.

05:07.989 --> 05:11.078
Our relationship
is complicated.

05:11.079 --> 05:12.247
What else did you do

05:12.248 --> 05:13.374
with that purple hair, Stu?

05:13.375 --> 05:15.211
I only created a super cure

05:15.212 --> 05:17.006
to cure all diseases.
That--that's it, I swear.

05:17.007 --> 05:19.010
And how do you explain
that abomination?

05:19.011 --> 05:22.643
Well, you can imagine
my surprise when

05:22.644 --> 05:23.854
34 years ago,

05:23.855 --> 05:26.066
a baby with your exact DNA

05:26.067 --> 05:28.487
popped up in a birthing pod
outside of New Bakersfield.

05:28.488 --> 05:30.199
She came from a pod?

05:30.200 --> 05:32.705
Has--has no one told you
where babies come from?

05:32.706 --> 05:34.834
Of course
I know about pods.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.336
I'm not an idiot.

05:36.337 --> 05:38.299
I just--you know,
who supplied the baby juice?

05:38.300 --> 05:40.428
Um...

05:40.429 --> 05:42.265
Ty-Anne's parents
were soldiers

05:42.266 --> 05:44.687
who were killed in the year 100
of the Cure Wars,

05:44.688 --> 05:46.816
so her pod, unclaimed,

05:46.817 --> 05:48.277
was scheduled for termination.

05:48.278 --> 05:49.864
This would've been legal
back then,

05:49.865 --> 05:51.576
because it was within
the eighth trimester.

05:51.577 --> 05:53.872
This was back when people
thought that pod life

05:53.873 --> 05:55.542
began in the 14th trimester.

05:55.543 --> 05:56.920
Course, now, we know, it's--

05:56.921 --> 05:59.800
Holy fucking shit,
get to the point.

06:01.805 --> 06:04.059
You saved my life.

06:04.060 --> 06:06.396
I thought this was my chance
to save your life,

06:06.397 --> 06:09.027
or what I thought
was your life.

06:09.028 --> 06:11.908
So that's me
from this timeline.

06:11.909 --> 06:13.870
I pictured, uh, different.

06:13.871 --> 06:15.582
I'm sorry.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.295
I--this--
this is a crazy idea.

06:18.296 --> 06:21.009
I--I thought you were looking
for some connection,

06:21.010 --> 06:23.347
and she needs--

06:23.348 --> 06:25.393
still trying to figure
that out.

06:25.394 --> 06:27.188
Don't blame yourself.

06:27.189 --> 06:28.858
Growing up,
the only parent I had

06:28.859 --> 06:30.862
was a damp pole
I called "Mother."

06:30.863 --> 06:32.323
I turned out fine.

06:33.786 --> 06:35.413
Hey, will you at least
stay for lunch?

06:35.414 --> 06:37.918
Dad, no!

06:47.104 --> 06:48.480
So, uh,

06:48.481 --> 06:50.234
how you liking those collards?

06:50.235 --> 06:52.781
Yeah, it's missing lard
and ham hocks.

06:52.782 --> 06:55.286
- I know.
- I'm sorry.

06:55.287 --> 06:56.496
The last pig

06:56.497 --> 06:59.419
passed away 74 years ago.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.465
His name was Percival.

07:01.466 --> 07:03.177
He was my friend.

07:07.019 --> 07:08.897
Honey, I really wish
you wouldn't reality-bounce

07:08.898 --> 07:11.152
at the table.

07:14.534 --> 07:15.703
Fine.

07:21.632 --> 07:22.758
You said I had to come.

07:22.759 --> 07:25.096
You didn't say I had to talk.

07:25.097 --> 07:27.183
This how every meal is?

07:27.184 --> 07:28.520
I'm sorry, no, I'm--
it's just--

07:28.521 --> 07:30.314
it's--it's a little weird,

07:30.315 --> 07:31.859
okay?

07:31.860 --> 07:34.155
The time-traveling version
of me shows up,

07:34.156 --> 07:36.994
and your first instinct
is lunch?

07:36.995 --> 07:38.540
Yeah, yeah, it's weird.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.544
Okay, so you both agree
on something.

07:40.545 --> 07:42.171
This is--it's weird.

07:42.172 --> 07:44.384
Okay, settle down.

07:45.805 --> 07:47.140
Huh.

07:47.141 --> 07:48.810
Does your--does your elbow
do this?

07:56.200 --> 07:57.870
Your knee?

07:57.871 --> 07:59.957
Can you do this?

07:59.958 --> 08:01.669
Ah, no.

08:01.670 --> 08:04.007
Ah, that's your juvenile
arthritis talking.

08:04.008 --> 08:07.973
Luckily, the gravity on Mars
is only 38% of what it is here.

08:07.974 --> 08:12.356
Ooh, that's such
a fun fact, Dad.

08:12.357 --> 08:14.319
I'm not going to Mars.

08:15.615 --> 08:16.824
She loves to dangle that,

08:16.825 --> 08:18.243
but she is definitely coming.

08:18.244 --> 08:19.830
She's gonna come.

08:19.831 --> 08:21.667
- Mm-hm.
- Over my dead body.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.378
Yeah, your body will be dead
if you do not come to Mars

08:23.379 --> 08:26.259
- with every other human being.
- Mm.

08:26.260 --> 08:28.305
She did the same thing
with her semester abroad

08:28.306 --> 08:30.017
at Mons Barcelona.

08:30.018 --> 08:31.562
But somebody ended up
loving it.

08:31.563 --> 08:33.983
Mm, I liked the tapas.

08:33.984 --> 08:37.031
Wait, so there's more
of these nerd farms?

08:37.032 --> 08:39.787
I call them self-sufficient
energy-neutral proto-colonies.

08:39.788 --> 08:41.832
So many words.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.418
But they are everywhere.

08:43.419 --> 08:44.880
All over the world.

08:44.881 --> 08:46.466
And unfortunately,
he's at every one.

08:46.467 --> 08:48.011
You should see
how boxy he looks

08:48.012 --> 08:49.390
in a kimono.

08:52.522 --> 08:55.234
Sometimes, I wish I had
a time machine.

08:55.235 --> 08:59.492
No, you don't wish you saw
anything that I've seen.

08:59.493 --> 09:00.912
Wolf and I are lucky

09:00.913 --> 09:02.498
that we're even alive
in this time.

09:02.499 --> 09:04.503
Wolf?

09:04.504 --> 09:06.172
What's, uh,

09:06.173 --> 09:07.551
her deal?

09:07.552 --> 09:09.387
He's a man in the NAG.

09:09.388 --> 09:10.849
My demolitions expert.

09:10.850 --> 09:13.771
Oh, well,
th--that's dangerous work.

09:13.772 --> 09:16.151
Is--is he missing a hand,

09:16.152 --> 09:18.196
or--or two?
Uh... an eye?

09:18.197 --> 09:19.992
There must be
some heavy scarring.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.204
No, no, he's got both hands,
and just

09:22.205 --> 09:24.125
just enough scars
to make him look like a man

09:24.126 --> 09:26.421
- who's really lived.
- Oh, so he's--he's an

09:26.422 --> 09:28.593
elderly fellow, like a--
like a Grandpa Wolf?

09:28.594 --> 09:31.599
No, he's a--
a muscular 35.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.688
Don't know why
you had to say "muscular,"

09:34.689 --> 09:36.232
but okay.

09:37.528 --> 09:39.531
Oh...

09:39.532 --> 09:41.994
my god.

09:41.995 --> 09:43.665
You're into her!

09:43.666 --> 09:45.794
- I am not!
- I'm just making

09:45.795 --> 09:47.421
lunch conversation.

09:47.422 --> 09:49.133
You don't want us to get
to know each other.

09:49.134 --> 09:50.762
You just want to stick
your ghost-dick

09:50.763 --> 09:52.641
in my time-twin.

09:56.817 --> 09:59.823
Ew, Dad, you're so weird.

10:07.212 --> 10:09.634
You guys have
a great relationship.

10:10.427 --> 10:11.846
Working on it.

10:11.847 --> 10:13.558
Another wheel,
another deal.

10:13.559 --> 10:14.810
Cha-ching.

10:14.811 --> 10:17.941
Wow, looks like the jar
is full.

10:17.942 --> 10:20.362
- Yep.
- Guess we should, uh,

10:20.363 --> 10:21.991
shut the business down,

10:21.992 --> 10:24.287
go our separate ways
until we run out of chits.

10:24.288 --> 10:25.707
Oh, no, you don't
stop working

10:25.708 --> 10:27.502
when the jar is full.

10:27.503 --> 10:29.380
You get another jar.

10:31.093 --> 10:32.846
Is this one of the things
I should be writing down?

10:32.847 --> 10:34.641
No, you--

10:34.642 --> 10:36.144
no, you don't need
to write it down, son.

10:36.145 --> 10:37.815
You just need
to breathe it in.

10:39.861 --> 10:41.488
Look, we're not soldiers

10:41.489 --> 10:44.243
locked in some
intractable conflict,

10:44.244 --> 10:45.872
blowing up laboratories

10:45.873 --> 10:48.961
and... risking our lives
to save humanity.

10:48.962 --> 10:51.550
We're doing something better.

10:51.551 --> 10:57.813
Making wheels.

10:57.814 --> 11:01.737
Take it for a spin.

11:01.738 --> 11:04.116
- Wheel-come to the store.
- How can we torque you?

11:04.117 --> 11:05.787
Gah!

11:05.788 --> 11:07.749
Idiot!

11:07.750 --> 11:09.126
- Take it easy, son.
- You gotta walk

11:09.127 --> 11:10.337
before you roll.

11:10.338 --> 11:12.466
See, see, that makes sense.

11:12.467 --> 11:13.761
What you looking for, friend?

11:13.762 --> 11:15.305
One wheel, please.

11:15.306 --> 11:16.349
Making a barrow.

11:16.350 --> 11:18.521
A wheelbarrow?

11:18.522 --> 11:21.317
Oh, no, don't tell me
you're still barrowing.

11:21.318 --> 11:23.823
- Still barrowing?
- What else is there?

11:23.824 --> 11:25.743
Well,

11:25.744 --> 11:27.329
if you're still using
a wheelbarrow,

11:27.330 --> 11:30.127
you're steering yourself
onto a dead-end street.

11:30.128 --> 11:32.298
Isn't that right, Pump?

11:32.299 --> 11:33.843
What do I say?

11:33.844 --> 11:35.053
Look,

11:35.054 --> 11:37.517
turn toward the horizon.

11:37.518 --> 11:39.730
Imagine the sound
of your wheel

11:39.731 --> 11:43.988
crunching the crisp dirt
alongside--what's that?

11:43.989 --> 11:45.575
Three other wheels.

11:47.747 --> 11:49.040
Wagon.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.879
Whoa.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.593
See, barrows, they get stuck
in every rut, pothole,

11:54.594 --> 11:56.972
crevice, cranny, crater,
and crag.

11:56.973 --> 11:58.517
You make a wagon,

11:58.518 --> 11:59.937
that wheel gets stuck,

11:59.938 --> 12:01.649
well, it's got three pals

12:01.650 --> 12:03.653
to help pull him
right out of there.

12:03.654 --> 12:05.280
Yeah,

12:05.281 --> 12:08.078
we're providers, right?

12:08.079 --> 12:09.790
How'd you like to have
three pals

12:09.791 --> 12:11.752
providing just as much as you?

12:11.753 --> 12:13.421
Sure would take
the pressure off.

12:13.422 --> 12:14.800
Oh, boy.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.346
But I make barrows.

12:17.347 --> 12:19.433
I'm Clamp Barrowmaker.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.855
Oh, no, see,

12:21.856 --> 12:25.445
all I hear is "Clamp"
and "maker."

12:25.446 --> 12:27.282
The rest is up to you.

12:30.206 --> 12:32.126
Got 'em right here!

12:32.127 --> 12:35.132
Ooh, sure wish I had
that wagon right about now.

12:35.133 --> 12:37.094
You will soon, Clamp...

12:37.095 --> 12:39.056
Wagonmaker.

12:42.063 --> 12:43.481
Mm!

12:43.482 --> 12:45.235
Oh.

12:45.236 --> 12:46.989
I know.

12:55.048 --> 12:58.303
Josh.
Josh!

13:04.984 --> 13:08.031
Jesus?

13:08.032 --> 13:09.993
Oh.

13:09.994 --> 13:12.498
I was so happy to see you.

13:12.499 --> 13:14.460
Could you maybe turn

13:14.461 --> 13:16.715
some of this sand
into some wine,

13:16.716 --> 13:18.928
and then maybe turn
some of that wine

13:18.929 --> 13:21.892
into some water?
I really need help.

13:21.893 --> 13:24.105
- Josh.
- Yeah?

13:24.106 --> 13:27.111
You will go
to the Dagobah system.

13:27.112 --> 13:28.572
Dagobah?

13:28.573 --> 13:30.910
There you will learn
from Yoda,

13:30.911 --> 13:33.123
the Jedi master
who instructed me.

13:33.124 --> 13:34.835
Yoda?

13:37.090 --> 13:39.176
Oh.

13:39.177 --> 13:40.721
I'm dying.

13:49.197 --> 13:50.741
Oh, God.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.662
I'm saved.

13:52.663 --> 13:54.958
Please, you gotta--

13:54.959 --> 13:56.753
You gotta--you gotta
help me out here.

13:56.754 --> 13:59.593
Oh, yeah, I'll help you,

13:59.594 --> 14:01.429
you filthy Stray.

14:01.430 --> 14:02.641
Huh?

14:09.947 --> 14:12.367
Better now?

14:12.368 --> 14:13.746
I guess.

14:13.747 --> 14:15.625
Maybe it is weird
that I have feelings

14:15.626 --> 14:16.919
for a woman
who's the genetic copy

14:16.920 --> 14:17.921
of my own daughter.

14:17.922 --> 14:19.966
Your adopted daughter.

14:19.967 --> 14:21.553
Yeah, but Ty-Anne's right.

14:21.554 --> 14:23.431
It's--it's not normal.

14:23.432 --> 14:26.354
You've talked a lot
about what Ty-Anne thinks,

14:26.355 --> 14:28.943
more proof of what a loving
and attentive father figure

14:28.944 --> 14:30.278
you are,

14:30.279 --> 14:31.823
but what about...

14:31.824 --> 14:33.326
what you think?

14:33.327 --> 14:35.288
I--I don't know.

14:35.289 --> 14:37.417
I mean,

14:37.418 --> 14:40.006
let's say you love
the Counting Crows,

14:40.007 --> 14:41.300
and they break up,

14:41.301 --> 14:42.762
and then the fan site,

14:42.763 --> 14:44.139
Crows Nest,

14:44.140 --> 14:45.266
says that they're never

14:45.267 --> 14:46.477
gonna get back together again,

14:46.478 --> 14:47.981
and you accept that.

14:47.982 --> 14:50.276
That'd be a tough pill
to swallow.

14:50.277 --> 14:51.905
I'm a Duritz-head,
through and through.

14:51.906 --> 14:53.491
Right.

14:53.492 --> 14:55.830
So you adopt
a Counting Crows cover band

14:55.831 --> 14:57.290
and you raise it
as your own,

14:57.291 --> 14:59.044
and you love her,

14:59.045 --> 15:00.881
and when she plays
"Mr. Jones,"

15:00.882 --> 15:04.723
it's--it's almost
like the real thing,

15:04.724 --> 15:07.227
and then the real Crows
get back together.

15:07.228 --> 15:09.023
You're gonna go see 'em,
right?

15:09.024 --> 15:11.444
I'm logging on
to ticketmaster.com right now.

15:11.445 --> 15:13.406
You get it.

15:13.407 --> 15:15.326
But it's--
it's still weird.

15:15.327 --> 15:18.792
Stu, I need to reset
your compass.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.838
It's not weird one bit.

15:20.839 --> 15:22.382
Sure, they have the same DNA,

15:22.383 --> 15:24.178
but they're from
different planes of existence.

15:24.179 --> 15:26.474
But I raised her
since she was a baby!

15:26.475 --> 15:28.896
Oh, so back in 2017,

15:28.897 --> 15:30.691
did you go on a date
with a baby?

15:30.692 --> 15:32.570
No.

15:32.571 --> 15:34.490
Seeing Tiger and Ty-Anne
as the same person

15:34.491 --> 15:35.785
is narrow-minded,

15:35.786 --> 15:37.245
and, if you don't
mind me saying,

15:37.246 --> 15:38.708
a little racist.

15:39.794 --> 15:41.337
You know, sometimes,

15:41.338 --> 15:43.174
you're too human, Stu.

15:43.175 --> 15:45.053
Oh, my--

15:45.054 --> 15:46.723
Maybe I should
just patch my software,

15:46.724 --> 15:48.769
get rid of all my flaws
and insecurities,

15:48.770 --> 15:51.023
and ascend to a higher plane
of consciousness

15:51.024 --> 15:53.194
as an all-knowing,
all-powerful super-being.

15:54.532 --> 15:56.910
No, no.

15:56.911 --> 15:59.456
That's the easy way out.

15:59.457 --> 16:01.837
That's the Stu
I'm inside.

16:07.975 --> 16:09.476
Fuck, yeah.

16:11.899 --> 16:15.238
What you working on
over there, buddy?

16:15.239 --> 16:17.075
Just a dream.

16:17.076 --> 16:18.787
I was thinking,

16:18.788 --> 16:22.169
you know the way you turned
that, uh, wheelbarrow

16:22.170 --> 16:23.755
into a wheel-wagon?

16:23.756 --> 16:25.383
- Yeah.
- What if we took

16:25.384 --> 16:26.720
a bicycle

16:26.721 --> 16:30.101
and added, like,
a bunch more wheels?

16:30.102 --> 16:31.730
I added six more wheels.

16:31.731 --> 16:33.942
That looks like
that big wheel back there

16:33.943 --> 16:35.571
is not even touching
the ground.

16:35.572 --> 16:37.575
I know.

16:37.576 --> 16:40.121
It's purely decorative,
and it was a dumb idea,

16:40.122 --> 16:41.165
but I just--
I love it.

16:43.504 --> 16:44.505
What?

16:44.506 --> 16:46.175
Yeah.

16:46.176 --> 16:48.471
There's beauty
in its impracticality.

16:52.188 --> 16:54.066
Just like this place.

16:57.783 --> 17:02.374
New, brimming with hope
and possibility,

17:02.375 --> 17:04.002
like a young foal:

17:04.003 --> 17:05.380
wobbly on its legs,

17:05.381 --> 17:07.677
but destined for greatness,

17:07.678 --> 17:10.599
to be a thoroughbred.

17:11.727 --> 17:12.853
Get out, Stray!

17:12.854 --> 17:14.106
Filthy Strays!

17:14.107 --> 17:15.901
Ooh!

17:15.902 --> 17:17.571
Yes!

17:17.572 --> 17:18.907
A rock to the face!

17:18.908 --> 17:21.287
- Why are you smiling, Binx?
- Ow.

17:21.288 --> 17:23.625
This pain is the price
of freedom.

17:23.626 --> 17:24.961
We're literally in chains.

17:24.962 --> 17:26.965
The chains of freedom!

17:26.966 --> 17:28.301
This is the first step

17:28.302 --> 17:29.344
toward becoming a part

17:29.345 --> 17:31.098
of this amazing community!

17:31.099 --> 17:32.350
You're here voluntarily?

17:32.351 --> 17:33.520
Well, of course I am.

17:33.521 --> 17:35.064
I come to these rocky shores

17:35.065 --> 17:36.818
a lowly Stray,

17:36.819 --> 17:39.489
weave my way into the fabric
of this great society,

17:39.490 --> 17:41.243
can have a Cluster of my own,

17:41.244 --> 17:42.412
so that one day,

17:42.413 --> 17:44.124
my children

17:44.125 --> 17:46.504
and my children's children--

17:46.505 --> 17:49.552
they can be the ones
throwing rocks.

17:49.553 --> 17:50.846
I don't know, man.

17:50.847 --> 17:52.975
That's a pretty
fucked-up dream.

17:52.976 --> 17:54.394
I'm pretty sure Cramble
over here

17:54.395 --> 17:55.396
is already dead.

17:55.397 --> 17:56.858
Get out of here!

17:58.362 --> 18:00.532
Oh, what's going on
out there?

18:00.533 --> 18:03.830
Fresh batch of Strays
are gonna be browned in.

18:03.831 --> 18:05.291
- What's wrong with them?
- What--what crime

18:05.292 --> 18:07.128
did they commit?

18:07.129 --> 18:08.715
The worst crime of all:

18:08.716 --> 18:10.301
not being born here.

18:10.302 --> 18:13.182
They think they can
just sneak into the NAG,

18:13.183 --> 18:15.854
get an easy ride
off our hard work,

18:15.855 --> 18:17.733
and steal our jobs.

18:17.734 --> 18:20.154
They're lazy
and they want to work?

18:20.155 --> 18:22.117
Yeah, that's right.

18:22.118 --> 18:23.829
But I got a basket
of giant rocks

18:23.830 --> 18:25.624
just for this.

18:25.625 --> 18:27.419
That doesn't really make--

18:27.420 --> 18:29.966
Citizens of the NAG!

18:29.967 --> 18:33.598
These Strays were caught
sniffing around our borders.

18:33.599 --> 18:36.437
They come from the wastelands
of Malibu,

18:36.438 --> 18:39.944
the volcanoes
of Catalina,

18:39.945 --> 18:41.781
and the Valley.

18:41.782 --> 18:44.161
Boo!

18:44.162 --> 18:47.793
They tried to sneak
into our above-ground paradise,

18:47.794 --> 18:51.008
live amongst us,
eat our beans,

18:51.009 --> 18:53.137
Sow in our circles,

18:53.138 --> 18:55.308
contribute to our society!

18:55.309 --> 18:58.022
Well, what do we say
to that?

18:58.023 --> 18:59.441
Not yet!

18:59.442 --> 19:00.611
That's right!

19:00.612 --> 19:02.865
Can just anybody
live here?

19:02.866 --> 19:03.909
No!

19:03.910 --> 19:06.371
Can Bio-Techs live here?

19:06.372 --> 19:07.833
No!

19:11.090 --> 19:12.467
Say it with me.

19:12.468 --> 19:14.680
If your pants make brown...

19:14.681 --> 19:16.684
Welcome to our town!

19:16.685 --> 19:18.939
And if your pants
stay dry...

19:18.940 --> 19:21.109
You're gonna die!

19:21.110 --> 19:23.072
Eat the shroom!

19:23.073 --> 19:25.284
God, sewer mushrooms.

19:25.285 --> 19:27.080
- Eat it!
- Mushroom!

19:27.081 --> 19:29.710
Binx, we're about
to shit ourselves,

19:29.711 --> 19:30.838
and it's gonna be bad.

19:30.839 --> 19:32.716
Nope.

19:32.717 --> 19:34.762
It's gonna be great.

19:34.763 --> 19:36.473
- Yeah!
- Mushroom!

19:38.771 --> 19:41.693
- Come on, Torque.
- Let's get past the splash zone.

19:41.694 --> 19:43.822
If someone fails
the Bio-Tech test,

19:43.823 --> 19:46.076
we gotta be part
of the slaughter mob.

19:47.706 --> 19:48.874
Oh, God, please don't--

19:48.875 --> 19:50.084
please don't--

19:50.085 --> 19:51.713
don't--

19:51.714 --> 19:53.465
Yeah!

19:55.387 --> 19:58.769
Futturman.

20:04.573 --> 20:07.745
Mm, knock denied!

20:07.746 --> 20:09.289
You're not even allowed here,
Dad!

20:09.290 --> 20:11.335
Uh, it's me.

20:11.336 --> 20:14.800
I mean, you, or whatever.
Can I come in?

20:14.801 --> 20:16.261
Fine.

20:16.262 --> 20:18.516
Just tell Dad
I'm not coming out.

20:18.517 --> 20:21.438
Right, yeah, he's--
he's not out here.

20:21.439 --> 20:23.317
That's weird.

20:23.318 --> 20:25.071
Usually, when I storm off
like that,

20:25.072 --> 20:26.616
he's lurking in the hallway,

20:26.617 --> 20:27.910
begging for my forgiveness.

20:27.911 --> 20:29.538
- Why?
- Can't he just, like,

20:29.539 --> 20:30.874
walk through the door?

20:30.875 --> 20:33.128
He wishes.

20:33.129 --> 20:34.255
We made a deal

20:34.256 --> 20:35.257
when I was 15

20:35.258 --> 20:36.259
that I would stop

20:36.260 --> 20:37.638
wearing napple-dazzlers

20:37.639 --> 20:39.182
and he would take my room
off the grid

20:39.183 --> 20:40.811
so that I could become a woman
in private.

20:40.812 --> 20:41.938
Mm.

20:41.939 --> 20:43.440
Nice, uh, pantlets.

20:43.441 --> 20:45.529
- They're jorts.
- I made them.

20:45.530 --> 20:47.950
I design all my own clothes
that only I wear

20:47.951 --> 20:49.160
because everyone else
is wearing

20:49.161 --> 20:50.329
those stupid jumpsuits,

20:50.330 --> 20:51.916
just running around the Mons,

20:51.917 --> 20:54.839
banking energy like a bunch
of solar sheep.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.926
Yeah, they do look
pretty stupid.

20:56.927 --> 20:58.722
You know, um, back in the '50s,

20:58.723 --> 21:02.311
I used to, uh,
mend my own socks.

21:02.312 --> 21:05.234
A pretty nimble

21:05.235 --> 21:07.155
darning stitch right there.

21:07.156 --> 21:09.451
- That's some nice needlework.
- Yeah.

21:09.452 --> 21:11.998
Wait, uh, is this wool?

21:11.999 --> 21:13.543
- Yeah.
- I have never seen

21:13.544 --> 21:15.087
wool before.

21:15.088 --> 21:16.841
You could actually--
you could have them

21:16.842 --> 21:19.680
if--mean--if you want.
They're all yours.

21:19.681 --> 21:23.772
Mm, I see what you're doing.

21:25.317 --> 21:26.861
You have a time machine.

21:26.862 --> 21:29.491
You could survive
literally anywhere,

21:29.492 --> 21:31.369
any place, any time,

21:31.370 --> 21:34.000
but you're here,

21:34.001 --> 21:35.837
looking for a home.

21:37.299 --> 21:39.219
M-maybe.

21:39.220 --> 21:41.264
Come on, Tiger.

21:41.265 --> 21:42.976
If you can't be honest
with yourself,

21:42.977 --> 21:44.563
who can you be honest with?

21:46.275 --> 21:47.401
Wolf?

21:50.952 --> 21:55.251
He doesn't know the truth
about you, does he?

21:55.252 --> 21:58.090
He just--
he wouldn't understand.

21:58.091 --> 22:02.223
The plan wasn't to come back
to a world like this,

22:02.224 --> 22:03.643
but...

22:03.644 --> 22:06.231
if you're here, and...

22:06.232 --> 22:08.443
you're not that bad,
then, well,

22:08.444 --> 22:10.907
it's easier for me to imagine

22:10.908 --> 22:12.995
a home here.

22:12.996 --> 22:14.330
Oh.

22:17.004 --> 22:19.215
This home's taken.

22:19.216 --> 22:21.178
Nobody wants you here,

22:21.179 --> 22:22.514
so why don't you leave

22:22.515 --> 22:24.643
and take your smelly socks
with you?

22:32.409 --> 22:35.372
Hey, you slept
through the hose-off.

22:35.373 --> 22:37.043
Oh, you must have
really been out of it,

22:37.044 --> 22:40.175
because that water was cold
and hard.

22:41.260 --> 22:42.512
Oh, God.

22:42.513 --> 22:43.973
I gotta get out of here.

22:46.772 --> 22:48.232
Wolf!

22:48.233 --> 22:50.779
I had to wait
till after the hose-down.

22:50.780 --> 22:53.242
Meet me around back.

22:53.243 --> 22:54.870
Just him.

22:54.871 --> 22:56.624
Okey-dokey.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.588
Eh.

22:59.589 --> 23:01.759
Spoink, huh?

23:01.760 --> 23:03.470
Oh, yeah, I remember that game.

23:03.471 --> 23:05.182
You gotta go in low and hard.

23:05.183 --> 23:07.353
Otherwise, you get out-spoinked
every time.

23:07.354 --> 23:10.192
You're focusing
on the wrong thing here, Wolf!

23:10.193 --> 23:11.904
I was kidnapped
by time terrorists.

23:11.905 --> 23:13.908
They're gonna start a war.
I'm scared,

23:13.909 --> 23:16.121
I'm dying,
I haven't had any water yet!

23:16.122 --> 23:18.500
That's a lot of breath
for a dying man.

23:18.501 --> 23:20.212
Hey, Torque, nice wagon!

23:20.213 --> 23:21.507
- Oh, hey.
- My daughter loved

23:21.508 --> 23:22.926
that bean cake
you dropped by.

23:22.927 --> 23:24.304
- Oh, yeah?
- My hubby Lathe

23:24.305 --> 23:25.557
could learn a thing or two

23:25.558 --> 23:27.268
from your Funnel.

23:27.269 --> 23:28.980
Fuck is happening?

23:33.114 --> 23:35.536
- Here you go.
- All right.

23:39.753 --> 23:43.634
Okay, so you're Torque now,

23:43.635 --> 23:46.181
and--and you have a family,

23:46.182 --> 23:48.268
and a small business.

23:48.269 --> 23:51.024
F--how many years
you been here?

23:51.025 --> 23:54.155
Oh, I think I'm going
on three...

23:54.156 --> 23:55.240
days?

23:55.241 --> 23:56.242
Days.

23:56.243 --> 23:57.871
And, uh,

23:57.872 --> 24:00.502
it's called a Cluster,
not a family.

24:00.503 --> 24:02.798
Once the wagon boom hits,

24:02.799 --> 24:06.180
this business is gonna
be anything but small.

24:11.566 --> 24:13.151
God, shit.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.530
Oh.

24:14.531 --> 24:16.534
Too good for bean juice,
are you?

24:16.535 --> 24:18.121
I thought you were dying.

24:20.584 --> 24:23.130
Wolf, is anything normal?

24:23.131 --> 24:25.093
Please, I'm--I'm begging you.

24:26.262 --> 24:28.724
- Oh, man, I'm sorry, buddy.
- Come here.

24:28.725 --> 24:31.062
Come here.

24:31.063 --> 24:33.108
I know being terror-snatched

24:33.109 --> 24:34.193
probably isn't the best way

24:34.194 --> 24:35.279
for this to come about,

24:35.280 --> 24:38.911
but I'm...

24:38.912 --> 24:40.497
I'm happy to see you.

24:43.505 --> 24:45.466
Wolf,

24:45.467 --> 24:46.844
I'm barely hanging on.

24:46.845 --> 24:48.514
Do you have anything to drink

24:48.515 --> 24:50.935
besides... bean juice?

24:50.936 --> 24:52.522
Oh.

24:52.523 --> 24:54.568
I could probably rustle up
some All-Nut milk.

24:54.569 --> 24:57.406
I'm allergic to nuts.

24:59.369 --> 25:00.830
I gotta do it.

25:00.831 --> 25:02.458
Okay.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.097
You got it, bud.

25:11.895 --> 25:13.648
It's very bean-forward.

25:13.649 --> 25:15.442
Yeah, makes sense.

25:15.443 --> 25:20.244
Get all of it there.

25:20.245 --> 25:22.122
Oh, you left

25:22.123 --> 25:24.377
just a little bit right there.

25:24.378 --> 25:25.673
Actually, it's quite a lot.

25:30.516 --> 25:32.645
Uh, where is Tiger?

25:35.693 --> 25:38.864
- I don't know.
- Your guess is as good as mine.

25:38.865 --> 25:40.577
She left me here to recover.

25:40.578 --> 25:42.454
She's probably off
doing recon or something.

25:42.455 --> 25:43.583
You guys haven't seen
each other

25:43.584 --> 25:45.127
since you've been back?

25:45.128 --> 25:46.170
Yeah, well, I was shot up
pretty good,

25:46.171 --> 25:47.716
and turns out, I have

25:47.717 --> 25:49.678
this pretty complicated
life here,

25:49.679 --> 25:51.849
so...

25:51.850 --> 25:53.853
You mean Torque does.

25:53.854 --> 25:55.397
Me, Torque, same diff.

25:55.398 --> 25:57.694
Look, I--I got six mouths
to feed,

25:57.695 --> 25:59.363
five spouses
to satisfy,

25:59.364 --> 26:00.908
and a daughter

26:00.909 --> 26:02.621
whose artistic ambitions
I'm trying to nurture.

26:02.622 --> 26:04.833
Also, there's
my plucky apprentice, Pump,

26:04.834 --> 26:08.298
who I'm helping
through some confidence issues.

26:08.299 --> 26:09.509
Literally none

26:09.510 --> 26:11.054
of your fake you problems

26:11.055 --> 26:13.308
mean anything right now.
We need to find Tiger

26:13.309 --> 26:15.354
and go back
and un-fuck this timeline.

26:15.355 --> 26:17.149
No.

26:17.150 --> 26:18.401
Listen to me.

26:18.402 --> 26:19.988
You can't leave the NAG.

26:19.989 --> 26:21.449
There are rules.

26:21.450 --> 26:23.119
People watching
your every move.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.790
This place is on lockdown.

26:24.791 --> 26:27.504
There is no way anyone
is getting out or in.

26:27.505 --> 26:28.756
Wolf.

26:28.757 --> 26:31.260
Pack your shit.
We're leaving.

26:31.261 --> 26:33.431
Oh, you're not dead.

26:33.432 --> 26:35.143
Fun.
You can come, too.

26:35.144 --> 26:36.187
Let's go.

26:36.188 --> 26:38.776
Hm.

26:38.777 --> 26:42.366
Guess she figured it out.
