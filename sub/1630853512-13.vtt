00:21.847 --> 00:23.458
FELIX:
Hey, Murph.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.373
How about some breakfast?I'm good.

00:27.723 --> 00:28.985
Funeral starts
in a couple hours.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.639
You might want to
eat something.

00:34.686 --> 00:36.471
No, I said I'm good.
I don't want anything.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.606
Come on, you haven't
had any food in days.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.348
[grunts]

00:44.392 --> 00:47.308
Will you just take one
bite for me, please?

00:47.351 --> 00:48.570
I'm not hungry, Felix.

00:52.313 --> 00:53.401
Murph...

00:54.576 --> 00:55.794
[sighs]

00:57.318 --> 00:58.928
It's gonna get easier.

01:02.323 --> 01:04.629
You're going to find
a reason to live again.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.765
I can't imagine
how you must feel,

01:09.808 --> 01:11.419
but I promise you'll
get through this.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.944
And...
[clears throat]

01:14.987 --> 01:18.121
[echoing]: I know it feels like
there's no point of anything.

01:18.165 --> 01:20.167
Of living,
even. But...

01:21.472 --> 01:22.778
...what you've been
going through--

01:22.821 --> 01:25.955
let's just take it
day by day, all right?

01:25.998 --> 01:27.783

01:41.536 --> 01:43.494
[indistinct conversation]

01:43.538 --> 01:45.583
[organ playing in distance]

01:55.637 --> 01:57.639
Hang on. Just
gi-give me a minute.

01:59.684 --> 02:01.338
Oh, my God,
I'm so hot.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.645
Yeah, it's finally
warming up, huh?

02:04.602 --> 02:06.648
[exhales]

02:08.606 --> 02:10.042
You okay?

02:10.086 --> 02:11.827
No, I'm not.

02:14.308 --> 02:17.006
On my way here, I'm just
thinking about how, like...

02:18.442 --> 02:19.791
...nothing changes.

02:19.835 --> 02:22.838
The people are still
getting their coffee,

02:22.881 --> 02:25.667
and texting their dumb friends,
and sitting in traffic and...

02:28.235 --> 02:30.802
The world doesn't even stop
for, like, a second,

02:30.846 --> 02:32.413
like, or one minute
so I can breathe.

02:32.456 --> 02:33.501
JOSH:
Hello, Murphy.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.290
What are you doing here?

02:41.465 --> 02:43.815
Thought I'd come by
and pay my respects.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.817
How you holding up?

02:45.861 --> 02:47.297
DARNELL:
Just walk away, Josh.

02:47.341 --> 02:49.604
FELIX:
Darnell, he's not worth it, man.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.693
I'll see you
in there.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.047
LESLEY:
Don't let him
get to you, Murphy.

02:58.090 --> 02:58.874
Just ignore him.

03:03.618 --> 03:04.880
FELIX:
We should go inside.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.621
DARNELL:
Yeah, let's...

03:08.188 --> 03:09.928
FELIX:
You ready?

03:33.517 --> 03:35.693
[sniffles, clears throat]

03:39.131 --> 03:40.524
Um...

03:42.309 --> 03:44.963
I'm not good
at these things, at-at, uh...

03:45.007 --> 03:47.096
I'm not good at...

03:47.139 --> 03:50.273
talking about my feelings
to, uh, a bunch of people.

03:50.317 --> 03:53.276
I'm not even good at talking
about my feelings to...

03:53.320 --> 03:55.583
like, one person. Um...

03:59.587 --> 04:02.981
That was the thing about Max.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.159
He somehow, like...

04:08.552 --> 04:10.337
...pulled my emotions out of me.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.688
I-I was kicking and screaming,
but he still did it.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.864
And he called me stubborn.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.344
[chuckles softly]

04:23.350 --> 04:25.003
Um, I remember one time...

04:25.047 --> 04:27.310
[sniffles]

04:27.354 --> 04:30.270
...Max was lying next to me
he was, he-he was sleeping.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.314
And...

04:32.315 --> 04:34.535
[chuckles softly]

04:34.578 --> 04:36.014
And-and he laughed.

04:36.058 --> 04:37.799
He-he laughed
while he was sleeping.

04:42.238 --> 04:44.980
I mean, he had every reason
to be self-loathing

04:45.023 --> 04:47.330
and-and feel sorry for himself,

04:47.374 --> 04:48.897
for the hand he was dealt,
but he-he didn't.

04:51.639 --> 04:52.988
He laughed
in his sleep.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.167
[sniffles]

05:06.393 --> 05:07.959
He gave me happiness.

05:11.136 --> 05:13.138
I didn't even think
that was possible, like...

05:14.575 --> 05:15.750
...to actually be happy,

05:15.793 --> 05:17.360
but he-he gave...

05:17.404 --> 05:19.014
he gave me that.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.715
And I will miss him
every single second

05:24.759 --> 05:26.630
of every single day.

05:29.198 --> 05:31.026
For the rest of my life.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.556
[sniffles]

05:39.600 --> 05:41.253
People-people
keep saying to me,

05:41.297 --> 05:44.213
"Oh, uh...

05:44.256 --> 05:45.388
God called him home."

05:45.432 --> 05:46.911
Well...

05:48.826 --> 05:50.437
...God had
nothing to do with this,

05:50.480 --> 05:52.830
and I'm pretty sure
that if God does exist,

05:52.874 --> 05:54.615
he has enough people
to hang out with.

05:54.658 --> 05:58.183
He did not need Max, too.
I needed him.

05:58.227 --> 06:01.839
And the reason Max isn't here...

06:01.883 --> 06:04.320
is because of
another human being.

06:06.104 --> 06:08.672
There is a person out there

06:08.716 --> 06:10.979
that took the love of my life

06:11.022 --> 06:12.807
away from me.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.292
I was just told

06:20.336 --> 06:22.338
that I need to find
a reason for living,

06:22.382 --> 06:23.339
I need to find a purpose.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.389
Well, I found one.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.435
I have one.

06:32.479 --> 06:35.699
I am going to find
the person that did this.

06:35.743 --> 06:38.659
And I am going to make them pay

06:38.702 --> 06:40.617
for what they've done!

07:01.116 --> 07:03.901
You know, I feel like I have
to say for the record,

07:03.945 --> 07:05.860
um, that's not
really what I meant.

07:05.903 --> 07:08.602
No, I know,
but I have to do this.

07:08.645 --> 07:09.994
Okay, so...

07:10.038 --> 07:11.256
what's your big plan--

07:11.300 --> 07:12.519
you gonna break
into prison

07:12.562 --> 07:13.650
and cut off Jimmy
McKay's ding-dong or...

07:13.694 --> 07:15.217
No, I don't care about Jimmy.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.348
He's gonna rot in prison.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.657
I'm after whoever
tipped him off.

07:21.832 --> 07:23.138
Whoever called him, that...

07:24.792 --> 07:26.794
Whoever wanted everything
to get messed up--

07:26.837 --> 07:29.405
that's the person that is
responsible for Max's death.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.233
Jimmy's just the one
who pulled the trigger.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.453
Murphy?

07:36.760 --> 07:38.370
Hey, Chloe.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.763
Hey, Chlo.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.417
I'll give you
two a minute.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.684
You came.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.382
[sighs]

07:50.426 --> 07:53.516
I heard what happened about Max.

07:55.039 --> 07:57.781
And I don't know
all the details,

07:57.825 --> 07:59.957
but...

08:00.001 --> 08:01.568
I know it had something to do

08:01.611 --> 08:04.527
with that stupid pill I took.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.486
No, Chloe. No.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.445
It has nothing
to do with you.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.230
I don't want you
feeling guilty for one second.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.756
Okay.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.758
Well...

08:17.801 --> 08:20.543
I still wanted to come
and say I'm sorry.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.240
[sniffles]

08:22.284 --> 08:23.807
I'm really happy you're here.

08:27.594 --> 08:28.769
[chuckles]

08:28.812 --> 08:31.467
It's nice to see her
smile, though.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.730
Okay, but you did
tell her she can't do

08:33.774 --> 08:35.558
whatever it is she's
planning on doing, right?

08:35.602 --> 08:37.168
No, I'm just...
[clears throat]

08:37.212 --> 08:38.735
gonna give her
a little bit of time.Felix.

08:38.779 --> 08:40.998
What? She...
This is how she copes.

08:41.042 --> 08:43.392
She needs to focus on something.
I don't know.

08:43.435 --> 08:44.959
I mean, at least
she's off the couch, right?

08:46.221 --> 08:47.614
Whatever.
Let's just hope

08:47.657 --> 08:49.833
she doesn't find
whoever this person is.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.096
How would
she do that?

08:52.140 --> 08:54.098
[door buzzes][lock clicks]

08:54.142 --> 08:56.579
You know, when I saw your name
on the visitor's log,

08:56.623 --> 08:58.973
I have to admit I was surprised.

09:00.322 --> 09:02.846
Yeah, well, I just came to ask
who called you that night.

09:02.890 --> 09:05.893
[exhales] I'm sorry?Someone called you

09:05.936 --> 09:08.286
to tell you we were
setting you up. Who was it?

09:10.375 --> 09:12.029
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

09:17.121 --> 09:20.777
You know, the prosecution is
going to call me as a witness.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.518
I know you're claiming
self-defense,

09:22.562 --> 09:23.998
that Max attacked you.

09:25.347 --> 09:28.872
And I was planning on
telling the truth, but...

09:28.916 --> 09:31.179
...I'm willing to go along
with your little story.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.662
All you have to do is tell me
who called you that night.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.057
And if you don't...

09:41.406 --> 09:43.104
...I'll bury you.

09:45.454 --> 09:47.282
[laughs]

09:49.676 --> 09:52.374
Oh, relax. Just relax.

09:54.681 --> 09:57.597
He said he was with Chicago PD.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.773
He had a British accent.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.777
Was his name Josh Wallace?

10:05.430 --> 10:07.911
Yeah. Yeah, that was it.

10:13.003 --> 10:16.616
Josh?Yep. I know.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.008
Oh, my God.

10:21.185 --> 10:22.230
Oh, my God.

10:22.273 --> 10:25.233
I want to kill Josh.
Serious.

10:25.276 --> 10:26.756
You're not gonna kill anyone.Yeah, I am.

10:26.800 --> 10:27.975
Murph, you're not just
gonna kill someone.

10:28.018 --> 10:29.150
Yeah, I am.
It's not just someone.

10:29.193 --> 10:31.152
It's Josh.

10:31.195 --> 10:33.241
And he loved that this happened.
He went to the funeral to gloat.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.373
He's-he's a psychopath.

10:37.071 --> 10:39.203
He's psychotic.

10:39.247 --> 10:40.727
Murph.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.206
I'm just asking you to
take a beat, please.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.861
I'm taking a beat.
What do you think this is?

10:44.905 --> 10:46.254
This is beat to figure out

10:46.297 --> 10:47.777
how to kill Josh
without getting caught.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.387
Oh, my God.That's my beat.

10:49.431 --> 10:50.650
Okay, look.

10:50.693 --> 10:51.912
I know we've done some...

10:51.955 --> 10:53.696
very bad things.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.306
Okay? In our lives,

10:55.350 --> 10:58.440
And I know you've-you've
seen more death than,

10:58.483 --> 11:01.617
you know, the
average joe.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.053
But you've never...

11:03.097 --> 11:04.011
you've never actually
killed anyone.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.493
Murphy...

11:09.669 --> 11:13.063
Max loved you, okay?

11:13.107 --> 11:16.066
He loved you so much.

11:16.110 --> 11:19.504
And he would not want you
to spend the rest of your life

11:19.548 --> 11:21.332
behind bars
on his account.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.988
He would want you
to live your life.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.122
That's what
he would want.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.081
So, please.

11:32.126 --> 11:35.477
Just... drop this.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.131
For his sake.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.529
Yeah.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.711
You're right. I'm just...

you weren't there.

I didn't come here...

16:30.206 --> 16:31.294
I swear. I didn't
come here to do anything.

16:31.338 --> 16:33.122
Oh, okay.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.515
So you just broke into
his house for a cup of tea?

16:34.558 --> 16:37.257
I just needed to talk to him.Talk to him.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.085
Yes.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.043
Okay? I listened
to everything you said.

16:41.087 --> 16:44.786
And I...
I really think I need...

16:44.829 --> 16:47.310
I need to confront Josh,
I need closure.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.356
That's how I'm gonna move on.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.053
And I was afraid
you wouldn't believe me,

16:51.097 --> 16:52.533
so I took the bus.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.362
Closure?Yes.

16:55.405 --> 16:56.624
Closure.

16:57.886 --> 17:00.062
But he's not even here,
so I'm just gonna wait for him.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.368
You can go.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.112
Well, you know,
it is 4:00 in the morning.

17:06.155 --> 17:07.722
Did you think maybe he's not
coming home tonight?

17:09.028 --> 17:11.073
Where would he be?I don't know.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.814
His dog isn't here.

17:12.857 --> 17:14.207
All of his clothes are gone.

17:15.425 --> 17:16.948
He left town.Well,

17:16.992 --> 17:17.949
after what you said
at Max's funeral,

17:17.993 --> 17:19.038
I don't blame him.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.691
Coward.

17:20.735 --> 17:22.737
[sighs]

17:22.780 --> 17:24.043
well, what if he...

17:24.086 --> 17:26.567
He could have gone
back to London.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.352
What if he went...
what if he went home?

17:29.396 --> 17:31.050
What if he...
He could be gone for years.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.747
What if he doesn't come back?

17:32.790 --> 17:34.096
What if he never
comes back here?Okay, okay.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.576
What if I don't get to see him

17:35.619 --> 17:37.143
and talk to him?Okay.

17:37.186 --> 17:38.448
What if I never see him?Shh. Take a breath.

17:40.885 --> 17:42.191
[sighs]

17:44.628 --> 17:48.371
Maybe we can both find out
where he went together.

17:48.415 --> 17:49.851
Okay?

17:55.422 --> 17:56.988
Any clue what
his password is?

17:58.599 --> 17:59.991
No.

18:00.035 --> 18:01.819
Great.

18:01.863 --> 18:04.387
Okay, well, then...

18:04.431 --> 18:07.216
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on a second.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.784
Looks like he printed this
out before he left.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.133
What is it?

18:11.177 --> 18:13.875
Okay, here we go.

18:13.918 --> 18:16.051
Vacation rental house
in Branson, Missouri.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.097
We can go to this address
and see if he's there.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.621
You don't have to
drive me, though.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.013
Yeah, I'll just
let you hitchhike.

18:22.057 --> 18:23.276
Of course I'm
gonna drive you.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.495
I'm gonna be with you every step
of every way

18:25.539 --> 18:27.410
in full support,

18:27.454 --> 18:29.238
'cause I think this could
actually be a good idea.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.893
Mm-hmm.Talking to Josh.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.243
Talking to Josh.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.291
Okay.

18:40.336 --> 18:44.079
â™ª Why do you keep
torturing me? â™ª

18:44.123 --> 18:45.689
â™ª Let me know you love me

18:45.733 --> 18:48.431
â™ª Or set me free

18:48.475 --> 18:49.824
â™ª Let me know

18:49.867 --> 18:52.435
â™ª Just how you feel...

18:52.479 --> 18:53.828
Are we there yet?

18:53.871 --> 18:55.786
[nasal voice]: Are we
there yet? Are we there yet?

18:55.830 --> 18:57.005
[normal voice]:
Like a five-year-old.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.181
Well, are we?No, we are not there yet.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.140
If we were there, the car
would not be moving.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.184
Five minutes.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.491
â™ª Your love is true

19:04.534 --> 19:05.666
â™ª Like the love

19:05.709 --> 19:08.756
â™ª I have for you

19:08.799 --> 19:11.150
â™ª Yeah, let me know
if your love is... â™ª

19:11.193 --> 19:12.803
This is the road.

19:12.847 --> 19:15.415
â™ª You know that love can be...

19:15.458 --> 19:17.808
Max would be proud
of you, you know?

19:19.506 --> 19:20.594
Yeah.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.511
I'm sorry, I...[exhales] It's okay.

19:24.554 --> 19:25.903
â™ª All ni...

19:35.174 --> 19:36.392
[exhales]

19:38.089 --> 19:41.615
Text Erika dog sitter.
"Just arrived.

19:41.658 --> 19:42.920
How's Oliver doing?"

19:42.964 --> 19:44.618
[phone beeps]

19:44.661 --> 19:47.360
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Cellular service not available.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.014
[sighs] Great.

20:14.604 --> 20:16.040
[engine stops]

20:17.520 --> 20:20.088
FELIX:
[sighs] We're here.

20:20.131 --> 20:23.874
Okay, wait, I think
I should go in alone.

20:23.918 --> 20:25.398
What?

20:25.441 --> 20:27.269
Yeah, I appreciate you...

20:27.313 --> 20:29.358
you know, wanting
to be here for me,

20:29.402 --> 20:32.013
but I-I don't need,
like, a guy

20:32.056 --> 20:33.667
to support me, so....

20:33.710 --> 20:35.799
I-I got-I got it.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.366
Okay.Okay.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.760
I'll be here.All right.

20:39.803 --> 20:42.806
Where's the...
Which way is the house?

20:42.850 --> 20:45.331
It's just, uh, about
30 feet to your left.

20:45.374 --> 20:46.419
Okay.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.552
Thank you.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.773
Why are you bringing
your backpack?

20:54.427 --> 20:55.776
I always take
my backpack with me.

20:55.819 --> 20:57.778
No, you don't.

20:58.822 --> 21:00.433
Okay. Well, I want it.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.609
Ready, buddy?You're just gonna
talk to him?

21:02.652 --> 21:04.306
Yes.
What is the big deal?

21:06.656 --> 21:08.223
Can I see the backpack?

21:09.572 --> 21:10.660
No.

21:12.009 --> 21:13.576
Murphy, can I see
the backpack?No, Felix.

21:13.620 --> 21:14.969
Stop it!

21:15.883 --> 21:18.320
I said no.
Felix!

21:18.364 --> 21:21.584
Stop it.What the hell is this?!

21:21.628 --> 21:23.847
Murphy?

21:23.891 --> 21:25.588
Are you still
planning on...Yep.

21:25.632 --> 21:28.025
Okay.Planning on killing him.

21:28.069 --> 21:30.811
Oh, my God.I am going to kill him.

21:30.854 --> 21:31.855
You lied to me.Okay, well...

21:31.899 --> 21:33.292
You manipulated me.

21:33.335 --> 21:34.771
You're the one
that showed up to Josh's

21:34.815 --> 21:36.817
and you forced me
to let you drive me here.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.209
Yeah, and you're the one who
gave me that whole moving thing

21:38.253 --> 21:39.646
about how you
need closure!

21:39.689 --> 21:40.864
This is my closure.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.258
Killing Josh
is not closure.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.868
Yeah, well,
we'll see, okay?

21:44.912 --> 21:46.827
Murphy.Get off.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.655
Get off, Felix.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.091
Murph, I told you.

21:50.134 --> 21:51.440
This is not what Max
would have wanted.

21:51.484 --> 21:53.747
Well, Max isn't here.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.139
I am!

21:56.358 --> 21:57.794
So I'm gonna deal with it
how I want.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.013
Murphy.

22:00.928 --> 22:02.538
Find inside. Go, go.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.148
You know, I hate-I hate
to be that guy here,

22:04.192 --> 22:06.020
but, um, you're blind.Shut up.

22:06.063 --> 22:08.022
So I don't know what you
think you're gonna do in there.Shh!

22:08.065 --> 22:10.241
Okay? You're
going to get caught!You're the one causing a scene.

22:10.285 --> 22:11.634
Shut up.[door slams]

22:13.941 --> 22:15.464
You're trespassing.FELIX: Oh, my God.

22:15.508 --> 22:18.162
Okay.
He's got a gun.

22:20.121 --> 22:22.341
What are you gonna do?

22:22.384 --> 22:23.516
Are you gonna kill me too?

22:23.559 --> 22:26.345
Just go home!

22:28.912 --> 22:31.306
Or what?JOSH: Or I'll pull the trigger.

22:32.263 --> 22:33.439
MURPHY:
[chuckles] Yeah?

22:33.482 --> 22:34.614
Then do it.

22:34.657 --> 22:36.006
[shouts]

22:36.050 --> 22:37.399
[grunting]

22:37.443 --> 22:38.618
MURPHY:
Oh!

22:38.661 --> 22:40.315
What's happening?

22:40.359 --> 22:41.403
Felix?

22:42.535 --> 22:44.406
Felix?

22:44.450 --> 22:46.103
Felix, what's happening?

22:48.584 --> 22:49.411
Whoa!

22:52.414 --> 22:55.286
Don't worry. I got the gun!

22:55.330 --> 22:56.723
Are you okay?Where's Josh?

22:56.766 --> 22:58.159
He's in the car.

22:58.202 --> 22:59.247
MURPHY: No, stop him.[engine starts]

22:59.290 --> 23:00.248
Stop him!

23:00.291 --> 23:02.468
Uh...

23:02.511 --> 23:03.730
Hey!

23:03.773 --> 23:06.341
Get out!
Get out of the car. Now!

23:06.385 --> 23:08.430
Josh, stop!
What are you doing?

23:08.474 --> 23:09.562
Aah!Aah!

23:12.129 --> 23:14.741
[engine revving]

23:18.005 --> 23:19.789
What happened?[mumbles]

23:21.051 --> 23:23.271
Get out of the car!

23:23.314 --> 23:25.926
Get out of the car now!Okay!

23:25.969 --> 23:28.929
Okay. Okay.

23:33.716 --> 23:35.326
Don't look at me.

23:35.370 --> 23:36.676
Move it!

23:39.722 --> 23:41.071
God...

23:41.115 --> 23:42.551
Pretzel.

23:46.468 --> 23:49.166
[crickets chirping][owl hooting]

23:49.210 --> 23:50.994
[Josh shouting, muffled]

23:54.171 --> 23:55.956
[muffled shouting continuing][chair clattering]

24:01.352 --> 24:04.181
FELIX:
Okay, so Josh is...

24:04.225 --> 24:06.749
tied up. He's not
going anywhere.

24:06.793 --> 24:08.664
Um...

24:10.710 --> 24:13.887
Okay, so...
I say we call the cops.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.279
No, we're not gonna
call the cops.

24:15.323 --> 24:16.803
They'll arrest us.No, they won't.

24:16.846 --> 24:18.674
Because we will tell them
that he pulled a gun on us

24:18.718 --> 24:19.762
then stole our car,

24:19.806 --> 24:21.068
then tried to
run us over with it.

24:21.111 --> 24:23.113
He'll probably do time in jail.

24:23.157 --> 24:24.506
Isn't that enough revenge?

24:26.552 --> 24:29.729
No.Oh, come on.

24:29.772 --> 24:32.471
Murphy, come on.
Please, don't do this.

24:34.342 --> 24:36.126
I have nothing left.You have the rest
of your life.

24:36.170 --> 24:37.998
What life?

24:39.565 --> 24:40.566
What life?

24:41.697 --> 24:44.265
He was everything.
He was my life.

24:55.798 --> 24:58.627
I know I'm not Max.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.151
But...

25:02.457 --> 25:03.502
...you have me.

25:05.591 --> 25:08.071
I need you.

25:08.115 --> 25:09.508
You're kind of like
my everything.

25:10.683 --> 25:13.207
Not like a, you know,
just in...

25:13.250 --> 25:16.253
You're my best friend.
You're my only friend.

25:17.820 --> 25:18.952
And where's that
gotten you?

25:18.995 --> 25:20.301
What?

25:20.344 --> 25:21.824
Where has that gotten you?

25:24.566 --> 25:25.567
Look around, Felix.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.091
Look around.

25:28.135 --> 25:29.615
Look at where you are.

25:29.658 --> 25:31.312
Look at what
I've turned you into.

25:31.355 --> 25:33.488
You didn't turn me in anything.Okay.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.577
As a matter of fact,

25:35.621 --> 25:38.580
you have made my life
a billion times better.

25:38.624 --> 25:39.842
[scoffs]You have.

25:39.886 --> 25:41.409
Just, you're so...
Shut up.

25:41.452 --> 25:43.106
You're so delusional.
Just...

25:43.150 --> 25:44.630
Wow.I don't know what
you want me to say.

25:46.457 --> 25:47.807
I have to do this.Why?

25:47.850 --> 25:49.286
Because.Why?

25:49.330 --> 25:50.679
Because.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.685
Choose me.Felix...

25:56.729 --> 25:58.426
Choose me.

25:59.645 --> 26:00.907
Murphy.

26:00.950 --> 26:03.039
Oh, my God.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.737
Choose our friendship.[sighs]

26:06.173 --> 26:08.523
The world sucks.
It's falling apart.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.308
You're like my
driftwood, you know,

26:11.352 --> 26:13.746
that I desperately cling
to in this tsunami of

26:13.789 --> 26:15.399
relentless garbage.

26:15.443 --> 26:17.271
Just really pulling out
all the stops here.

26:20.361 --> 26:22.972
I've never actually cared
about another person.

26:23.016 --> 26:24.974
I've only cared about myself.

26:27.803 --> 26:29.457
You changed that.

26:33.504 --> 26:36.290
You taught me how to not be
such an entitled dick.

26:38.901 --> 26:42.513
Like, how to actually
be a friend.

26:45.038 --> 26:46.648
Don't do this.

26:46.692 --> 26:48.607
I need you.

26:58.747 --> 27:01.054
I'm so hungry. Can you see
if there's any food in here?

27:02.229 --> 27:03.534
[short chuckle]

27:06.450 --> 27:08.888
Pizza's disgusting.I know.

27:11.151 --> 27:12.674
Can I, um,

27:12.718 --> 27:15.155
suggest somethingto you?

27:15.198 --> 27:17.548
Without you killing
me too, of course.

27:17.592 --> 27:19.420
I don't know.
What is it?

27:19.463 --> 27:20.813
Well...

27:20.856 --> 27:22.728
why don't you try
talking to him?

27:24.860 --> 27:26.906
What?

27:26.949 --> 27:28.821
I mean, I know you were lying
when you said you wanted

27:28.864 --> 27:30.866
to talk to him to
get closure, but...

27:30.910 --> 27:31.911
it's actually not
the worst idea.Why would...

27:31.954 --> 27:33.608
why would I possibly do that?

27:33.652 --> 27:35.610
Because, may-maybe
he feels bad.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.090
Maybe he knows what he
did is really messed-up.

27:37.133 --> 27:38.569
No.Maybe he's... it's
eating him alive.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.659
Yeah, he feels zero remorse.
None.

27:42.399 --> 27:43.705
Well, can you just try?

27:43.749 --> 27:45.185
Why?Because.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.492
You want me to try something
I know is not gonna work?

27:49.755 --> 27:50.843
Yeah.

27:54.063 --> 27:55.195
Fine.

27:56.152 --> 27:57.719
Thank you.

27:59.503 --> 28:00.853
[both sigh]

28:04.030 --> 28:05.684
Geez.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.691
Hmm.

28:12.734 --> 28:15.650
Uh... Pretzel looks like

28:15.694 --> 28:17.521
he really has to pee.
He's all antsy, eyeing the door.

28:17.565 --> 28:19.132
Do you want to take him out
before you talk to Josh?

28:19.175 --> 28:21.525
MURPHY:
Fine. Whatever.

28:21.569 --> 28:23.745
Pretzel, come here.

28:23.789 --> 28:25.529
Come on.
We're going outside.

28:27.009 --> 28:28.881
[sighs]

28:28.924 --> 28:30.273
See you soon.

28:30.317 --> 28:31.710
[door closes]

28:33.015 --> 28:34.800
Okay, here's the deal.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.237
Here's the deal.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.979
I am literally about
to save your life,

28:40.022 --> 28:42.459
but you have to do
exactly what I say, okay?

28:42.503 --> 28:44.331
I have convinced Murphy
to have a conversation.

28:44.374 --> 28:46.028
You are gonna be remorseful.

28:46.072 --> 28:48.248
I don't care if that's how
you actually feel or not,

28:48.291 --> 28:50.467
but you're gonna make
it sound like you do.

28:50.511 --> 28:52.643
I don't want her to kill you.

28:52.687 --> 28:54.733
So say you're sorry.
You understand?

28:57.039 --> 28:58.737
[muffled]: Fine.[door opens]

28:58.780 --> 28:59.563
MURPHY:Felix?

28:59.607 --> 29:01.043
FELIX:
Yeah?

29:01.087 --> 29:02.741
Where are you?Oh.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.310
His gag fell off,
so I was just, uh...

29:07.354 --> 29:08.834
tightening it.

29:10.226 --> 29:11.967
Why? I thought you were
forcing me to talk to him.

29:13.664 --> 29:15.797
Oh, yeah. [chuckles]
Stupid. Yeah.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.625
Okay, if you're ready.

29:17.668 --> 29:19.018
And everybody's ready.

29:20.976 --> 29:22.369
Let's do it.

29:35.686 --> 29:38.472
Okay. Well...

29:38.515 --> 29:39.995
here we are.

29:44.957 --> 29:47.481
A lot has happened
between the two of you.

29:47.524 --> 29:50.310
But we're all adults here.

29:50.353 --> 29:52.486
So, call me optimistic,

29:52.529 --> 29:54.444
but I think we can come
to some sort of truce.

29:56.751 --> 29:58.013
This is so stupid.JOSH: Murphy, wait.

30:03.018 --> 30:04.846
I'm sorry.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.806
I'm so sorry.

30:09.285 --> 30:12.332
I went insane, okay?

30:13.899 --> 30:15.204
I went insane.

30:16.379 --> 30:17.816
I don't know what came over me.

30:19.252 --> 30:21.515
I don't know
what I was thinking.

30:23.038 --> 30:24.823
I...

30:26.389 --> 30:28.783
I-I needed to see you suffer.

30:30.132 --> 30:32.134
Because I was suffering so much.

30:34.789 --> 30:36.138
You killed me.

30:38.358 --> 30:39.881
You destroyed me.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.452
You broke my heart.

30:46.975 --> 30:49.021
And-and now look
what you were gonna do.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.460
Look at you were gonna do
because...

30:53.503 --> 30:55.854
because your heart
is broken too.

31:00.293 --> 31:01.860
Please.

31:08.475 --> 31:10.085
Powerful stuff.

31:10.738 --> 31:12.131
Communicating.

31:12.174 --> 31:14.785
Let's keep it going.
It's very good.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.311
Listen.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.227
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

31:22.532 --> 31:23.838
And-and if

31:23.882 --> 31:25.840
there's even
the slightest of chances

31:25.884 --> 31:28.538
that my dying

31:28.582 --> 31:30.105
will take your pain away...

31:32.673 --> 31:35.806
....then I'll put the knife
through my own heart.

31:43.205 --> 31:46.426
A load of crap.

31:46.469 --> 31:49.124
What?You'll put the knife
through your own heart?

31:50.647 --> 31:51.735
Shut up.

31:53.172 --> 31:54.738
Oh, good idea, mate.

31:54.782 --> 31:56.653
What did you
just say?

31:59.918 --> 32:02.529
Hmm?What did he just say?

32:02.572 --> 32:04.400
Him?
He didn't say anything.

32:04.444 --> 32:05.575
Nothing.

32:07.490 --> 32:08.839
Did you put him up to this?

32:08.883 --> 32:10.929
I didn't...
I did not put him up to this.

32:10.972 --> 32:13.322
What, are you
on his side now?I am not...

32:13.366 --> 32:16.499
The only side I'm on
is you not killing anybody.Felix! what are you doing?

32:16.543 --> 32:18.501
Please, Murphy, please.Are you kidding me?

32:18.545 --> 32:19.981
Come on, this is not
who you are.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.070
No, stop saying that.
This is who I am.

32:22.114 --> 32:24.029
This is who I am.
You obviously

32:24.072 --> 32:25.378
don't know me as well
you think you do.Yes, I do.

32:25.421 --> 32:27.162
No, you don't.If you cross this line,

32:27.206 --> 32:29.295
you cannot uncross it.I'm doing it.

32:29.338 --> 32:31.906
Do you understand?I'm doing it.
I'm doing it, Felix.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.864
I'm doing it.
It's what he deserves.

32:35.127 --> 32:37.303
And there's nothing you can say
or do to talk me out of it.

32:37.346 --> 32:39.348
So you can sit either
here and watch,

32:39.392 --> 32:40.828
or you can get out.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.047
I'm not gonna sit here
and watch.

32:42.090 --> 32:43.831
Then get out!Fine!

32:51.708 --> 32:53.536
Sorry I couldn't stop you.

32:53.580 --> 32:55.799
I don't know what else to say.

32:57.149 --> 32:58.846
I'm taking this so at least
he can't hurt you.

33:06.288 --> 33:07.202
JOSH:
Felix!

33:07.246 --> 33:08.987
[grunts]
Felix.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.640
Stay.

33:10.684 --> 33:12.555
Just, just, just...
please, stay.

33:12.599 --> 33:13.992
Look, all three of us.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.515
All three of us,
we c-we can work this out

33:15.558 --> 33:17.038
and we can talk through it.

33:17.082 --> 33:18.431
Just, just, just, please, stay.

33:18.474 --> 33:20.955
Go, Felix.Felix, please.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.697
Just, just stay.
Felix! Felix!

33:23.740 --> 33:26.091
Felix, come back!

33:26.134 --> 33:27.962
Felix, come on. Oh, God.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.877
Felix, you know
she's gonna kill me!

33:50.202 --> 33:53.857
[chuckles] You know what
the true irony is here?

34:01.604 --> 34:04.259
You were convinced I was this

34:04.303 --> 34:05.347
deranged...

34:05.391 --> 34:07.001
Murphy.murderer.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.350
A murderer.Please don't do this.

34:10.004 --> 34:12.354
But the truth is...Please, just-just stop.

34:12.398 --> 34:13.834
Just-just...

34:13.877 --> 34:14.791
...I've never actually
killed anyone.

34:14.835 --> 34:16.010
This-this is so stupid.
Just...

34:16.054 --> 34:17.185
Ever.

34:17.229 --> 34:20.319
Stop! Please.

34:20.362 --> 34:21.755
Until now.

[grunting]

34:27.152 --> 34:28.283
You...

34:29.632 --> 34:32.374
...turned me into the
psychopath you thought I was.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.943
You did.

34:45.431 --> 34:46.997
Josh?

Whatever's cheapest.

Hey.

â™ª For I knew
everything I touched â™ª[sighs]

39:59.962 --> 40:02.138
â™ª Would wither
and would die... â™ª

40:02.182 --> 40:03.488
Why are you wearing that?

40:03.531 --> 40:05.620
â™ª And love...

40:05.664 --> 40:07.622
I wanted a souvenir.

40:07.666 --> 40:11.365
â™ª And grow from
all these seed... â™ª

40:16.501 --> 40:18.938
Smells like smoke.
Are you smoking again?

40:18.981 --> 40:20.548
Maybe. Maybe I have. Yes.Well...

40:20.592 --> 40:22.768
well, it's disgusting.

Just shockingly pungent

Where?

40:27.816 --> 40:30.776
â™ª Sparkled in the mornin' dew

40:30.819 --> 40:33.387
â™ª I braided twigs of willows [snorts]

Thank you.For what?

40:50.491 --> 40:52.928
â™ª I leaned against
a bark of birch... â™ª

40:52.972 --> 40:54.539
I don't know.
Just being my friend.

40:54.582 --> 40:56.497
Mm.

40:56.541 --> 40:58.804
â™ª I saw a northbound
flock of geese â™ª

â™ª Against a sky
of baby blue... â™ª

41:02.547 --> 41:04.636
â™ª Beside the lily pads

â™ª I carved a whistle

â™ª Mother Nature's quite a lady

â™ª Flesh and blood
needs flesh and blood â™ª

41:16.952 --> 41:19.694
â™ª And you're the one I need

41:31.489 --> 41:34.317
â™ª A cardinal sang just for me

41:34.361 --> 41:36.929
â™ª And I thanked him
for the song â™ª

â™ª Then the sun went
slowly down the west â™ª

41:40.280 --> 41:43.283
â™ª And I had to move along

â™ª These were some
of the things â™ª

41:45.764 --> 41:48.549
â™ª On which my mind
