00:20.812 --> 00:22.731
LINDA:
Oh, I love the flea market.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.441
You never know what you're gonna find.

00:24.524 --> 00:25.692
Hopefully not fleas.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.485
You kids looking for
anything in particular?

00:27.569 --> 00:30.447
-Knives.
-A really loud musical
instrument would be nice.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.574
-Hatchet.
-Maybe something
of the plastic horse variety.

00:32.657 --> 00:33.575
Nunchucks.

00:33.658 --> 00:34.826
And what about you, Bob?

00:34.909 --> 00:37.078
Well, I'll be looking for
old cast iron pans.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.080
-To use as a weapon?
-For cooking.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.624
But as a weapon, I guess,
if it came to it.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.168
Like if you had to fend off a Hamburglar?

00:43.251 --> 00:44.252
-Maybe.
-Just be careful, Dad.

00:44.336 --> 00:45.837
Thank you, Tina.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.839
Okay, kids, here's a couple of bucks each.

00:47.922 --> 00:48.923
-Go nuts.
-(phone vibrating)

00:49.007 --> 00:50.842
Or buy some nuts.
Other people's used nuts.

00:50.925 --> 00:53.803
-Hey, Gayle.
-Linda, is it dangerous to eat a tangerine

00:53.887 --> 00:55.680
with a carrot? They're both orange.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.933
-It's fine. I've done it many a time.
-Okay, bye.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.102
-(sighs) That was Gayle.
-Did she want to know if it was okay

01:01.186 --> 01:02.562
to combine something with something else?

01:02.645 --> 01:05.774
Yeah. Orange foods. It's okay, right?

01:05.857 --> 01:08.610
GENE: What are all these small
pictures of baseball players?

01:08.693 --> 01:11.196
They don't look that athletic,
but they are holding bats.

01:11.279 --> 01:13.406
-Is this guy smoking?
-Oh, yeah.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.951
Oh, look at that sweater.
Ooh, look at that rug.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.245
Ooh, look at the painting. Sunset.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.164
Is it a good painting, Bob? I can't tell.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.708
Me neither.
H-How do you tell if a painting is good?

01:23.792 --> 01:25.293
I don't know. Shapes?

01:25.377 --> 01:26.753
Lin, I just don't know if we need

01:26.836 --> 01:28.672
a steamer trunk full of old <i>TV Guides.</i>

01:28.755 --> 01:30.131
Oh, my God!

01:30.215 --> 01:31.591
LINDA:
The Wheelie frickin' Mammoth!

01:31.675 --> 01:33.051
Bob, it's the Wheelie frickin' Mammoth!

01:33.134 --> 01:34.719
-I know.
-It found us!

01:34.803 --> 01:37.389
How did it find us? Why did it find us?

01:37.472 --> 01:39.057
We got rid of it. Are we cursed?

01:39.140 --> 01:40.225
It's not our fault.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.060
The kids completely
stopped playing with it.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.978
<i>BOB:</i>
<i>And it was way too big for our apartment.</i>

01:44.062 --> 01:45.230
<i>LINDA: Way too big.</i>

01:56.241 --> 01:57.534
Aah!

01:57.617 --> 01:59.285
And it's not like
we planned on getting rid

01:59.369 --> 02:00.787
of our kids' huge toy.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.872
-It just happened.
-Yeah. The truck

02:02.956 --> 02:04.082
<i>was just... it was there.</i>

02:04.165 --> 02:06.292
<i>BOB:</i>
<i>And the kids were at school.</i>

02:06.376 --> 02:08.211
They didn't play with it anymore.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.341
And we thought they would
just kind of forget about it.

02:13.425 --> 02:15.093
-We were sure they'd forget.
-But then they didn't.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.512
<i>LOUISE:</i>
<i>Oh, hey, Mom, Dad,</i>

02:17.595 --> 02:19.305
have you guys seen
the Wheelie Mammoth anywhere?

02:19.389 --> 02:22.475
We want to jump off
the fire escape and land on him.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.561
Um, first of all,
don't jump off the fire escape.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.104
Isn't that what fire escapes are for?

02:26.187 --> 02:27.856
That's what fire escapes are for, Dad.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.149
Yeah, it's safe.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.526
Uh, no. Secondly, uh, we thought you guys

02:31.609 --> 02:33.695
didn't really play
with Wheelie Mammoth anymore,

02:33.778 --> 02:36.364
so, um, we donated it.

02:36.448 --> 02:37.532
KIDS:
You what?!

02:37.615 --> 02:39.492
You got rid of the sixth Belcher?!

02:39.576 --> 02:40.910
-Uh, yeah.
-Months ago.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.456
And, uh, you're
only noticing now, I might add.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.624
How could you?
Is your heart made of stone?

02:46.708 --> 02:49.627
Well, we donated it to a-a special place

02:49.711 --> 02:51.796
that'll make you guys <i>not</i> mad at us.

02:51.880 --> 02:55.008
Um, somewhere Wheelie
could live a better life.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.718
To a roller rink.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.636
Uh, yeah.
'Cause it's got wheels.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.013
The roller rink in town?

03:00.096 --> 03:01.556
Uh, no, no.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.016
A different town.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.018
Still kind of mad here, people.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.895
Trying not to lose my cool.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.730
Why would you do that?!

03:08.813 --> 03:12.025
Uh, 'cause these aren't just,
uh, regular kids.

03:12.108 --> 03:13.526
They're, um...

03:13.610 --> 03:14.861
-Orphans!
-Yup.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.279
They're orphans.
Yup.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.365
Sad little orphans,
with soot-covered faces,

03:18.448 --> 03:20.033
and the only joy in their lives

03:20.116 --> 03:22.202
is getting out on the rink
with that mammoth.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.454
-GENE: Hmm.
-Yeah, and we've been wanting
to tell you guys,

03:24.537 --> 03:26.539
but we were waiting for...

03:26.623 --> 03:28.583
A-A signed thank-you card
from all the orphans.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.627
I don't know what's taking them so long.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.629
Uh, maybe they're busy with orphan stuff.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.172
Scrubbing floors and stairs...

03:34.255 --> 03:37.550
Hiding in laundry baskets,
singing about tomorrow.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.552
Huh.
And you guys are for real right now?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.262
-Promise.
-Absolutely.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.390
Well, I guess Wheelie
is probably having a better life

03:43.473 --> 03:45.392
at that rink than it was here.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.394
And doing more good.
It tripped me a lot.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.687
Like, a lot.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.438
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to my room

03:50.522 --> 03:51.898
to write a tribute song about Wheelie.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.692
I'm thinking of calling it
"Rollin' Down the River,"

03:53.775 --> 03:54.818
if that's not taken.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.403
Or "Dream On," if it is.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.696
LINDA:
And now the bastard's here.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.280
I'm freaking out.
What do we do?

03:59.364 --> 04:01.074
Do we-do we tell the kids the truth

04:01.157 --> 04:02.992
about how we didn't
tell them the truth before?

04:03.076 --> 04:05.578
Are you nuts? They'd never
look at us the same way again.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.997
It'll be all right--
my parents lied to me and Gayle

04:08.081 --> 04:09.124
-all the time.
-Uh-huh.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.710
But Gayle turned out to be Gayle.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.628
We cannot let the kids see this.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.630
Okay, let's think.
Wh-What are out options?

04:15.714 --> 04:18.049
-Besides telling the truth?
-Oh, yeah, besides that.

04:18.133 --> 04:21.428
This palomino is now a pal-o'-mine-o.
(chuckles)

04:21.511 --> 04:23.888
Hey, guys, I'm gonna go show
Mom and Dad my new horse

04:23.972 --> 04:25.640
and probably say that palomino/
pal-o'-mine-o thing again

04:25.724 --> 04:27.684
-to them again.
-Yeah, you definitely should.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.144
You're gonna love my room.

04:29.227 --> 04:31.104
It smells pretty okay most of the time.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.231
You're used to a barn,
so you should be fine with it.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.858
Okay, the kids haven't seen it,
so we're fine.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.860
We just need to gather them up, go home

04:36.943 --> 04:38.903
before they...
Oh, my God, there's Tina!

04:38.987 --> 04:40.530
Oh, crap, oh, crap, oh, crap!

04:42.615 --> 04:45.744
You are my mane man.
Heh.

04:45.827 --> 04:46.995
There's more where that came from.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.955
No, no, no.
She's gonna see the Wheelie Mammoth.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.666
-(grunts)
-Oh, my baby!

04:51.750 --> 04:53.251
Look how big you're getting.
(grunts)

04:53.335 --> 04:54.836
But Mama can still carry you.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.213
(straining): Look at me go.
Look at me stand.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.591
Very impressive, Mom, but...
can you put me down?

04:59.674 --> 05:00.967
Wasn't that fun?

05:01.051 --> 05:04.095
Uh, yup. Hey, did I hear you and Dad
scream a second ago?

05:04.179 --> 05:06.306
Oh, hey, I-I just came over here to...

05:06.389 --> 05:08.683
-to see you.
-Oh, maybe you heard us, um, yell,

05:08.767 --> 05:12.145
because we were shocked
at the price of an old CD.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.688
Three dollars?
For music?

05:13.772 --> 05:16.191
"No, thank you, Dave Matthews,"

05:16.274 --> 05:17.942
is what we said, loudly.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.070
Oh, hey, do you like this horse I got?

05:20.153 --> 05:23.406
This palomino is now a pal-o'-mine-o.
(quiet chuckle)

05:23.490 --> 05:24.824
Great, great, great.
Uh, hey, let's find

05:24.908 --> 05:26.701
-your brother and sister.
-Yeah, let's go this way.

05:26.785 --> 05:27.994
Come on, Tina.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.788
Hey, kids, I know
we haven't been here long,

05:29.871 --> 05:32.040
but, uh, what do you say
we get on home, huh?

05:32.123 --> 05:33.625
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.960
Did you know all this stuff is used?
It's gross.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.421
We should leave. Now.
Out that far exit.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.048
Is that even where we came in?

05:40.131 --> 05:41.299
Let's say it is.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.301
But I've spent neither of my two dollars.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.595
And I've only spent $1.50.
And got the greatest thing

05:45.679 --> 05:47.222
in the world, 'cause this palomino is...

05:47.305 --> 05:49.099
Uh, let's go talk about it
in the car, right?

05:49.182 --> 05:51.643
-Come on, let's go, let's go.
-Mom, what's going on?

05:51.726 --> 05:53.687
You guys are acting weirder than usual.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.522
We came all this way for dumb stuff,

05:55.605 --> 05:57.524
and we've barely looked at anything dumb.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.192
Yeah, I got my eyes on a rusty screwdriver

05:59.275 --> 06:01.194
and some of those baseball guys,
but I don't know

06:01.277 --> 06:03.196
-what else is out there.
-I've still got 50 cents.

06:03.279 --> 06:05.532
And 50 cents at the flea market
is like a thousand dollars

06:05.615 --> 06:07.659
-at an inside store.
-LOUISE: Uh...

06:07.742 --> 06:10.370
Ooh, Louise, switchblades!
Look! Stabby stabby.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.579
Yes, please.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.415
Yeah, go play with the knives, kids.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.542
Okay, they're not going along
with the leaving plan,

06:15.625 --> 06:17.210
so we got to sneak over
and buy the Wheelie Mammoth,

06:17.293 --> 06:19.796
ditch it here someplace
where the kids can't see it,

06:19.879 --> 06:21.673
-and then we're in the clear.
-Seriously?

06:21.756 --> 06:23.508
-You got a better idea?
-(sighs) No.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.051
So I'll keep the kids busy.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.137
You go and take care
of the Wheelie Mammoth, capisce?

06:27.220 --> 06:29.222
-Got it.
-I need to hear you say "capisce."

06:29.305 --> 06:30.557
-Why?
-Just say it.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.226
-(sighs) Fine. Capisce.
-There you go.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.979
Hey, uh, that big, uh, stuffed animal

06:36.062 --> 06:37.647
looks sort of interesting, I-I guess.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.107
-(chuckles softly)
-Um, well,

06:39.190 --> 06:40.859
-what are you asking for it?
-A hundred.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.277
(high-pitched):
Hundred dollars?

06:42.360 --> 06:44.029
I-I mean, uh, a hundred, huh?

06:44.112 --> 06:45.488
Yeah, it's pretty special.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.907
Big, majestic creature
wearing those roller skates.

06:47.991 --> 06:51.327
Imagine a time when these things
used to roam the land. Man!

06:51.411 --> 06:53.121
I'm hardly interested in it at all.

06:53.204 --> 06:56.583
I'm over here, looking at this,
uh, <i>Remains of the Day</i> poster.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.585
I'm-I'm a huge Anthony Hopkins fan.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.546
Or A-Hop, as I call him.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.631
LOUISE: I've been wondering
if my room has the right amount

07:03.715 --> 07:05.675
of swords in it--
'cause right now it's at zero,

07:05.759 --> 07:07.469
and I feel like that's low.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.846
Um, maybe we should stay
in the pocket knife family.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.057
Does it seem like Mom and Dad
are acting weird to you?

07:12.140 --> 07:13.641
Ooh, you think someone's gonna propose?

07:14.893 --> 07:16.811
-(whispers): Hello.
-Linda, did you know

07:16.895 --> 07:18.521
you could wear a turtleneck as pants?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.482
I don't have time for this
right now, Gayle.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.525
You just need a safety pin for the middle.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.694
Mom's on the phone, Mom's off the phone,

07:24.778 --> 07:26.529
Mom and Dad are whispering to each other,

07:26.613 --> 07:28.365
Mom's picking people up
and carrying them around.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.824
-Some of us.
-Lucky.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.701
Do you think maybe Mom and Dad
came to the flea market

07:31.785 --> 07:32.911
to do something weird?

07:32.994 --> 07:34.913
-Like this is a cover?
-Like spy stuff?

07:34.996 --> 07:36.247
Or drug stuff?

07:36.331 --> 07:37.916
(gasps)
Are they drug spies?

07:37.999 --> 07:39.334
Oh, my God, Mom and Dad are drug spies.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.960
-That's hot.
-You think Mom and Dad

07:41.044 --> 07:42.962
-LINDA: Uh-huh. Okay.
-are flea market drug spies?

07:43.046 --> 07:44.756
-It just makes sense.
-Mom's the brains.
-Right.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.216
-Dad's the body.
-No.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.592
It's way too cool for them.

07:47.676 --> 07:48.635
But something is up.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.762
Look at her on that phone all secret-like.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.263
-Oh, Gayle, I got to go.
-No...

07:52.347 --> 07:54.349
-Bob, talk to me.
-It's so expensive, Lin.

07:54.432 --> 07:57.143
-She wants a hundred dollars.
-You want me to come over there
and negotiate?

07:57.227 --> 07:59.270
'Cause I'm a much better
negotiator than you.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.897
That's not true.
We're both bad.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.899
Well, I'm less bad.
Look, I got to go.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.484
Make it happen.
I love you.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.695
I love you, too.
You're worse at negotiating.

08:06.778 --> 08:09.739
Well, that was
a normal conversation. Hi, kids.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.450
So normal of you to say that.

08:12.534 --> 08:15.620
Hi again.
Uh, I'd like to formally offer you,

08:15.704 --> 08:18.873
uh, ten dollars in cash
for the stuffed animal.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.626
And I'm sorry to say,
this offer is time sensitive,

08:21.710 --> 08:25.463
because I have to...
fly to a business meeting.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.298
(whistles)
You're really good at this.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.883
Uh, I guess I could do $90.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.553
(sighs): Look, I'm not flying
to a business meeting.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.805
-You're not?
-No, and I don't have a lot of money.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.558
We own a restaurant
that not many people eat at.

08:36.641 --> 08:39.561
But I could give you free burgers instead,

08:39.644 --> 08:41.688
-if you eat burgers.
-Are they good burgers?

08:41.771 --> 08:43.857
I mean, I-I do try really hard.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.067
Tell you what, how about you give me...

08:46.151 --> 08:49.362
ten bucks now and, uh,
30 free burgers down the road.

08:49.446 --> 08:52.073
Wait. 30 burgers is way more than $90.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.284
Eh, yes and no.
You own a restaurant.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.995
You understand
hard costs versus soft costs.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.163
I don't, actually.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.956
Fixed costs versus variable costs.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.875
Mm-mm, don't recognize those words.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.543
Trust me, this works for both of us.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.628
Slightly more for me.
But you're getting a great deal.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.964
-♪ ♪
-If you think about it,

09:08.048 --> 09:10.383
an accordion is just burping with notes.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.885
Sounds so good, sweetie.

09:11.968 --> 09:15.138
Okay, you keep looking around,
in this area, and don't go

09:15.221 --> 09:16.973
-to a different area.
-Sure.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.808
-How'd it go?
-I got it.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.268
You did?
You made the deal?

09:20.352 --> 09:22.187
Please tell me you didn't
pay a hundred dollars, Bob.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.355
All right, enough of this.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.273
Let's go listen in on that sneaky pants.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.275
Okay, I really don't know
how much I paid for it.

09:27.359 --> 09:28.651
There's really no way to know.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.112
But I've got it, and now
I've got to get rid of it.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.322
Um, do the kids suspect anything?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.157
I think we're good.
As far as they know,

09:34.240 --> 09:35.950
that mammoth is still rolling
on that rink,

09:36.034 --> 09:38.370
-up to his butt in orphans.
-"That mammoth"?

09:38.453 --> 09:39.662
Did she just say "that mammoth,"

09:39.746 --> 09:41.539
-as in Wheelie Mammoth?
-I think she did.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.376
So they didn't donate Wheelie
to the orphans at the roller rink.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.336
Our parents are lying liars.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.797
How do they sleep at night-- <i>lying</i> down?

09:48.880 --> 09:51.257
-On their lies?
-I knew there was something fishy

09:51.341 --> 09:52.550
about that donation stuff.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.969
I just couldn't put my finger
on what it was

09:55.053 --> 09:58.139
about that orphan roller rink
story that didn't add up.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.933
I think Mom and Dad need to be punished.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.268
within the maximum recommended
sentence of the law,

10:02.352 --> 10:04.437
-Sword?
-Worse. We mess with them.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.563
GENE:
Mm?

10:15.407 --> 10:17.742
GENE:
Oh, I'd wear a kimono all the time.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.160
There are pockets in the sleeves.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.329
I can put chicken wings in here,
dip in here...

10:21.413 --> 10:23.039
-Mm-hmm.
-(panting): Oh, hey, guys.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.916
-There you are.
-You're pretty sweaty.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.836
Oh, yeah.
Someone was, um... selling a treadmill.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.879
So, I think I've seen enough dumb stuff.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.172
Should we get going?

10:31.256 --> 10:32.841
Um, sure.
Yeah, yeah.

10:32.924 --> 10:35.093
-Yeah, I could go home now, I suppose.
-Goodbye, kimono.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.678
(whispers):
Wait for me.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.805
Don't sell it to Steven Tyler!

10:38.888 --> 10:40.807
Except I actually don't feel like

10:40.890 --> 10:43.018
going home just yet.
Do you guys?

10:43.101 --> 10:44.519
-Uh-uh.
-No, I don't feel like going home.

10:44.602 --> 10:45.562
Y-You don't?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.772
We don't.
I just bought this little guy,

10:47.856 --> 10:49.441
and I thought to myself,

10:49.524 --> 10:51.526
“You know who would appreciate
this more than me?”

10:51.609 --> 10:52.777
Mm, who?

10:52.861 --> 10:54.571
The orphans at that roller rink

10:54.654 --> 10:56.906
where you guys donated
the Wheelie Mammoth.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.408
-Uh-huh-huh...
-Okay...

10:58.491 --> 11:00.118
So I would like to go there.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.120
And we can also say hi
to our old pal, Wheelie.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.247
That is where he is, right?

11:04.330 --> 11:07.000
Yeah!
Of course that’s where he is, silly.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.418
He’s <i>so</i> there.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.295
Good!
Well, I hope he’s not too busy

11:10.378 --> 11:12.422
helping orphans learn to skate to say hi.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.424
So shall we go
to that roller rink right now?

11:14.507 --> 11:16.051
Uh, I don’t see why not.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.594
Uh, yeah, we could do that.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.928
Uh-huh. Yep.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.930
Great, I love going to places
where things are.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.057
It’s the best.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.433
Crap.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.312
Okay, so not ideal.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.855
Yeah, Louise clearly knows.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.398
Nah-uh.
She only thinks she knows,

11:30.482 --> 11:32.442
because she doesn’t know she knows.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.319
Because she doesn’t know, you know?

11:34.402 --> 11:36.863
Right. Also, that was
a really dumb lie we made up.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.740
Well, it sounded good at the time.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.367
I always wanted to help orphans.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.035
(sighs)
Can’t we just tell them the truth?

11:42.118 --> 11:45.205
No. Never. What we got to do
is turn this lie into a truth.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.916
-Then it’s not a lie anymore.
-That doesn’t sound right.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.626
How about this:
you drive the kids

11:49.709 --> 11:51.836
to that roller rink in Bog Harbor.

11:51.920 --> 11:52.879
You know the one, on route 16.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.631
But drive very slowly.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.633
The Wheelie Mammoth and I
get a ride with Gayle.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.510
-Gayle?
-Yeah, she’s got a car.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.845
She can take a break
from eating tangerines and carrots.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.889
We’ll beat you guys there,
get everything in place,

12:02.972 --> 12:04.557
and-and we’ll get out.

12:04.641 --> 12:05.892
Okay, where’d you hide the thing?

12:05.975 --> 12:07.185
Uh, by a tree over there.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.521
Oh, God, with a note.
Uh, you better hurry.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.690
-Also this is the worst plan.
-Great plan.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.359
So Mom’s staying to go to the bathroom

12:14.442 --> 12:17.237
at the porta-potty because she likes it?

12:17.320 --> 12:18.238
She loves it.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.156
And we’re not waiting for her?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.158
No way.
I mean, this is her special time.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.661
So we’ll swing by
after we’re done at the rink

12:24.744 --> 12:26.037
and see if she’s finished.

12:26.121 --> 12:27.414
This all makes sense, Dad.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.541
Just a couple more questions about the...

12:29.624 --> 12:31.376
Oh, my God, I love this song.
I want to sing.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.627
We should all sing.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.720
Gayle! Over here! Gayle!

12:41.803 --> 12:43.388
I came as fast as I could.

12:43.471 --> 12:46.057
I didn’t even change-- look, turtle pants.

12:46.141 --> 12:48.143
LOUISE:
So, Dad, when you donated

12:48.226 --> 12:50.937
Wheelie to the roller rink,
did they give you a receipt?

12:51.021 --> 12:52.522
You know, something for your records?

12:52.605 --> 12:54.149
Ah, I’d love to see it sometime.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.984
Or would you rather discuss the orphans?

12:56.067 --> 12:58.111
And their therapeutic roller skating?

12:58.194 --> 13:01.406
Uh... (sing-songy):
who wants ice cream?

13:01.489 --> 13:03.408
-Yay!
-Yay!

13:03.491 --> 13:05.660
Gayle, you got to step on it.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.746
I’ll tell you what,
if you get a ticket, I’ll pay for it.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.497
You will?
That’s fun.

13:09.581 --> 13:10.749
I like going fast.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.167
Should I keep my eyes open?

13:12.250 --> 13:13.626
Yes, keep your eyes open!

13:13.710 --> 13:16.755
I can’t believe you let us
get a second cone.

13:16.838 --> 13:18.214
The line was so long.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.091
But you just wanted
to get right back in there.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.177
And then you wanted to taste every flavor.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.512
And then you counted out
your money so carefully.

13:24.596 --> 13:28.058
It’s almost like you’re not in a hurry
to get to the roller rink.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.143
What?
Come on.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.644
Oh, boy.

13:31.728 --> 13:32.896
What do you mean "oh boy"?

13:32.979 --> 13:35.732
Oh, boy...
Uh, look at those trees off

13:35.815 --> 13:38.735
to the right-- they look
just like the trees in that movie.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.070
I mean, I guess.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.780
What movie am I thinking of?

13:41.863 --> 13:43.656
You’re gonna think of it before I do.

13:43.740 --> 13:44.991
(muffled):
Hi, Bob, it's me, Gayle!

13:45.075 --> 13:46.534
But keep looking that way.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.912
Keep looking at the trees
and tell me what movie.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.914
<i>-Amadeus?</i>
-No, that's not it.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.583
What is it?
Oh, God, keep looking.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.293
LINDA:
Go, go, go! Park around back!

13:55.377 --> 13:57.462
-Park around back!
-GAYLE: Okay, okay.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.009
Manager! Manager!
Is there a manager here?!

14:03.093 --> 14:04.678
Manager!

14:04.761 --> 14:06.638
I’m the manager.
Is everything okay?

14:06.721 --> 14:08.390
Ooh.
Who’s this big furry fella?

14:08.473 --> 14:11.059
Listen, my husband and kids
are gonna be here any minute,

14:11.142 --> 14:13.353
and I need you to pretend
like this huge Wheelie Mammoth

14:13.436 --> 14:15.772
has been here for months
because we donated it to you.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.774
And it helps orphans learn to skate.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.234
and my husband and I are great parents.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.403
Okay, sure.
No problem.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.821
Really?
You’d do that?

14:22.904 --> 14:24.030
Yeah, I’ve been stuck in a lie

14:24.114 --> 14:25.073
with my kids before.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.491
I told them if you swallow gum,

14:26.574 --> 14:28.034
it stays in your stomach for seven years.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.244
I had to get a radiologist

14:29.327 --> 14:30.578
to make a fake X-ray of a kid

14:30.662 --> 14:31.996
with a lot of gum in their stomach.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.289
Great, so you get it.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.958
Okay, so can you just kind of

14:35.041 --> 14:37.210
put it out there on the rink,
and tell these kids

14:37.293 --> 14:39.295
they can push it around or something?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.256
And if they could shout,
"This thing is really teaching me

14:41.339 --> 14:43.550
-how to skate," that would be great.
-I don’t see why not.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.760
And, uh, maybe rub some soot
on the kids' faces?

14:45.844 --> 14:47.512
Too far, too far.
Never mind, never mind.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.222
Uh, thank you so much.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.849
Oh, and I wasn’t here or her.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.976
It’s gonna be hard to forget this.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.311
But you do it.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.147
LOUISE:
Well, here we are.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.899
I’m sure we’ll see
the Wheelie Mammoth any minute now.

14:59.983 --> 15:02.193
I-I’m, uh, sure we-we will.

15:02.277 --> 15:03.945
Huh.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.697
And-and there’s Wheelie Mammoth!
Ha-ha!

15:05.780 --> 15:08.116
I mean, uh, there he is, uh, obviously.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.868
-Would you look at that?
-Huh.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.995
Hi, do you need to rent skates?

15:12.078 --> 15:14.414
No, uh, no, we, uh, just came

15:14.497 --> 15:16.958
to see that woolly mammoth.

15:17.042 --> 15:19.961
Oh, yes!
Thank you so much for donating him.

15:20.045 --> 15:23.298
Really? My mom and dad
really did donate him here?

15:23.381 --> 15:24.674
They sure did.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.760
And are the orphans enjoying him?

15:26.843 --> 15:28.845
The orphans just adore him.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.098
Oh, my God. Wheelie
really is teaching kids how to skate.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.266
GENE:
Barely.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.143
LINDA:
I mean, it’s not a big deal

15:35.226 --> 15:37.187
if you think about it.
Sometimes parents got

15:37.270 --> 15:39.272
to tell little fibs to their little kids,
‘cause they’re

15:39.356 --> 15:41.066
too little to hear the truth, you know?

15:41.149 --> 15:43.151
Uh-huh.
Do you think my car likes me?

15:43.234 --> 15:45.612
It’s like Mom and Dad
and your immortal goldfish.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.280
Like how they would replace your goldfish

15:47.364 --> 15:48.323
every time it died.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.200
-What?
-I mean, uh, nothing.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.118
Let’s, uh, talk about your car liking you.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.370
I think it does.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.915
My beloved goldfish lived 18 years with me

15:56.998 --> 15:59.459
before getting sent
to the National Aquarium

15:59.542 --> 16:01.544
to be studied and to relax.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.879
Uh, right, yeah.
No, no, I know.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.464
Forget I said anything.

16:04.547 --> 16:07.717
Are you telling me
Mom and Dad lied to me?!

16:07.801 --> 16:11.554
Are you telling me
Goldylicious isn’t immortal

16:11.638 --> 16:14.641
and doesn’t see the birthday cards
I send her every year?

16:14.724 --> 16:17.352
What?
No, no, come on.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.229
I cannot believe this.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.356
Gayle!
Gayle, where are you going?

16:21.439 --> 16:23.525
I will not let you

16:23.608 --> 16:25.694
pull a Goldylicious on your kids.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.530
Gayle, no!
(grunting)

16:28.613 --> 16:29.948
Oh, come on!

16:30.031 --> 16:32.409
Oh. Oh, my foot.
Oh, my butt! Ow! Oh...

16:32.492 --> 16:35.036
You’re a hero
and you’re a family of heroes.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.871
-Keep it up.
-Well, I’ll be.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.416
-How about that.
-Dad, I don’t know what to say.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.918
We didn’t think you and Mom
were telling the truth.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.503
Sorry?

16:43.586 --> 16:45.505
No, no, no, no, no! No!

16:45.588 --> 16:47.340
Hey, Aunt Gayle.
What are you doing here?

16:47.424 --> 16:48.758
Linda lied!

16:48.842 --> 16:50.510
-To your faces!
-BOB: Mm-mmm.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.345
-Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm, mm-mmm...
-We took the Wheelie Mammoth

16:52.429 --> 16:55.306
here today from the flea market.

16:55.390 --> 16:58.601
And I drove over 90 miles per hour

16:58.685 --> 17:00.437
with my eyes open.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.689
Ha! I knew it!
Well, I take back that sorry.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.232
Is that true, Dad?

17:04.315 --> 17:07.193
Uh... who wants ice cream?

17:07.277 --> 17:08.695
-Me!
-Gene!

17:08.778 --> 17:09.988
I mean, I’m so mad at you right now

17:10.071 --> 17:12.782
I could eat ice cream or ribs!

17:14.868 --> 17:16.536
<i>LOUISE:</i>
<i>It feels weird</i>

17:16.619 --> 17:18.997
to say this, but,
Aunt Gayle, keep talking.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.624
-Tell us everything.
-Okay, there I was...

17:21.708 --> 17:22.834
LINDA:
Don’t listen to Gayle!

17:22.917 --> 17:24.502
She’s just pranking you!

17:24.586 --> 17:26.421
-It’s, it’s a fun prank.
-Oh really, Mom?

17:26.504 --> 17:28.840
Then why are you here?
Are you part of the prank?

17:28.923 --> 17:31.593
Yeah! Yeah.
I ran into Gayle at the porta-potty

17:31.676 --> 17:33.178
at the flea market
and we decided to come here

17:33.261 --> 17:34.929
and prank you guys.
Isn’t that funny?

17:35.013 --> 17:36.765
So your prank is for Aunt Gayle

17:36.848 --> 17:38.767
to show up and tell us you lied to us?

17:38.850 --> 17:40.810
-Yeah.
-I don’t know what to believe.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.187
How dare you.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.064
You’re just like Mom and Dad.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.858
You’re a liar and you’re married
and you had kids.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.985
Lin, maybe we just... you know?

17:49.069 --> 17:50.737
-What?
-You know?

17:50.820 --> 17:52.947
(chuckles)
You mea-you mean keep having fun

17:53.031 --> 17:55.241
with this really great prank
that’s going really well?

17:55.325 --> 17:57.994
-(chuckles weakly)
-I am so disappointed in you.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.829
Were those even movie trees, Dad?

17:59.913 --> 18:02.123
We will discuss your punishment
when we get home.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.376
There will be spanking.
On both cheeks.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.169
You tell ‘em, kids!

18:06.252 --> 18:08.963
Ugh. Oh, fine.
I’m sorry.

18:09.047 --> 18:12.008
It all happened so fast
over several months.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.802
And several hours today.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.970
-And it was mostly your mom’s idea.
-Thanks, Bob.

18:16.054 --> 18:18.098
Seriously though, I am sorry, too.

18:18.181 --> 18:19.849
I was happy to see it go.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.560
But, I guess, as a dad, I should’ve known

18:22.644 --> 18:25.355
it’s wrong to steal toys from children.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.108
Most of the time.
It’s not stealing if it’s at the park

18:28.191 --> 18:29.984
and you give it to your cat, right?

18:30.068 --> 18:32.070
Oh, we’ll go get the mammoth.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.280
And try to all
fit in the apartment with it, I guess.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.324
Hi.
Oh, you guys still here?

18:36.408 --> 18:37.534
You want to rent skates?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.119
Uh, sorry, uh, we just

18:39.202 --> 18:41.538
have to get the mammoth and bring it home.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.415
Oh, uh, that’s not gonna work for me.

18:43.498 --> 18:44.582
What do you mean?

18:44.666 --> 18:47.043
We did the big lie
and we made the lie real.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.795
And it’s great.
This thing’s our mascot now.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.547
I already updated the website.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.132
-You did?
-Yeah, check it out.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.967
Oh, it looks good.
Ooh, I like that design.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.427
This is a game changer.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.053
In the rink business,
you get a break like this

18:57.137 --> 18:59.639
once in a lifetime. I mean,
that thing probably costs a fortune.

18:59.723 --> 19:01.933
Probably.
But, you know, soft cost.

19:02.017 --> 19:04.144
Never mind.
Listen, our kids are really mad at us,

19:04.227 --> 19:07.022
and the only way to try and make it right
is to take this home.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.481
What about the orphans?

19:08.565 --> 19:10.191
They’re not orphans.
We made that up.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.818
I bet at least a couple of them are.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.779
This magical guy is staying right here.

19:14.863 --> 19:17.782
Please, sir, um, don’t...
(laughs) Don’t do this.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.909
So much of my life
I let slip through my fingers.

19:19.993 --> 19:20.952
Not this time.

19:21.036 --> 19:22.871
We need this mammoth!

19:22.954 --> 19:24.664
Linda, keep pulling.
He’s got no traction.

19:24.748 --> 19:25.790
He’s on wheels.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.001
Orphans, attack!

19:28.084 --> 19:30.128
Please, I think you need
a day off or something.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.546
Bob, we can take this guy.

19:31.629 --> 19:32.964
We can take him!
I’m gonna bite him!

19:33.048 --> 19:34.382
Aah!
Don’t bite me!

19:34.466 --> 19:35.884
Hey!
We’re whipping him around.

19:35.967 --> 19:37.302
Keep whipping, Bob!
Keep whipping!

19:37.385 --> 19:39.137
Aah! Aah!

19:39.220 --> 19:41.681
Hey, hey, hey! Stop! Stop!

19:41.765 --> 19:43.683
Look, we’ve had a little talk.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.311
-We want to leave Wheelie here.
-Huh?
-You do?

19:46.394 --> 19:48.229
We want to make the lie real.

19:48.313 --> 19:50.732
We don’t like how it got here,
but it seems

19:50.815 --> 19:53.026
-like the right home for him.
-He’ll be happy here.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.153
Lot of space, good vibes, cool jams.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.113
And he’s a sucker for a disco ball.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.324
-I mean, who isn’t?
-Uh, I’m not.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.618
It’s a bunch of broken glass
spinning around.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.995
Ugh, terrifying.
It could kill us all.

20:04.079 --> 20:06.498
Kids, that’s so nice of you.
So mature.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.458
Yeah, I’m impressed.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.710
You know, we-we thought
you wouldn’t be able to handle

20:10.794 --> 20:13.088
having to give away a huge stuffed animal

20:13.171 --> 20:15.006
that didn’t fit in any room.

20:15.090 --> 20:16.508
But we should have been honest with you

20:16.591 --> 20:18.551
and trusted that you could handle it.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.679
We got more handles
than a grocery bag, baby.

20:20.762 --> 20:23.390
So I’m gonna let go of this,
and no one’s gonna take it?

20:23.473 --> 20:24.974
-And no one’s gonna bite me?
-Aw, yeah.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.726
Sorry I said I was gonna bite you.

20:26.810 --> 20:28.561
I wasn’t gonna do that.
I’ve never bitten anybody.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.105
ALL:
That’s a lie.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.356
We call her piranha mama.

20:31.439 --> 20:32.691
She bit a guy at the grocery store.

20:32.774 --> 20:34.234
W-We’re still not allowed
to go to that one.

20:34.317 --> 20:36.152
-Well, I’m not, you are.
-Hey, one last skate

20:36.236 --> 20:37.737
with Wheelie before we go?

20:39.322 --> 20:40.865
I’m not good at this at all!

20:40.949 --> 20:42.450
I’m usually so graceful!

20:42.534 --> 20:44.452
I-I think this is how I die.

20:44.536 --> 20:46.121
I can only go backwards.

20:46.204 --> 20:48.456
Tell me if there’s anyone there.
Tell me if there’s anyone there!

20:48.540 --> 20:50.417
Whoa! I-I don’t want Wheelie
to remember us this way.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.378
Listen, if you ever want
to bust out of here, no questions asked,

20:53.461 --> 20:55.130
you call me, okay?
And, hey,

20:55.213 --> 20:57.340
-keep it wheel.
-Yeah, you just slip them on.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.718
You can pee right through the neck hole.

20:59.801 --> 21:00.844
<i>It's so convenient.</i>
