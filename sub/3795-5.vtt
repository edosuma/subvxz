00:02.836 --> 00:04.571
The only thing that's important
to me is Vince's career.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.640
Script's great,
good work, Scott.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.508
You have a ping-pong table?
Come on, let's play. I'll go easy on you.

00:08.543 --> 00:09.609
Oh-hh!

00:09.644 --> 00:12.079
It's gonna be a long day
for "uncle Jesse."

00:12.113 --> 00:13.280
I think we should
stick together.

00:13.314 --> 00:14.981
- Ahem...
- No hug.

00:15.016 --> 00:17.050
- Do you want to talk about the show?
- I'll talk to Phil.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.919
I beat him at golf once, he
didn't talk to me for two years.

00:18.953 --> 00:21.354
You know maybe this is something you
could've told me before the meeting.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.223
I need a face for
my family's tequila.

00:23.257 --> 00:26.693
Alex tells me that you are very
close friends with Vincent chase.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.262
Lizzie, I was hoping that we
could part on good terms.

00:29.297 --> 00:32.165
Huh... you can go
fuck yourself, Ari.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.267
You beat me right now and
I'll do your tv show.

00:36.938 --> 00:38.705
Stay tonight.
Sleep on it.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.740
Are we sleeping on it together?

00:40.775 --> 00:42.242
- So I guess that's it, huh?
- Let me read the script first...

00:42.276 --> 00:44.611
- yes! Yes!
- But I'll consider it.

00:44.645 --> 00:45.912
You screwed me,

00:45.947 --> 00:47.948
and I am gonna do everything
I can to pay you back.

you read a book a week?

Some of them
don't even have pictures.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.041
I'm not... I'm not trying
to be insulting.

02:22.076 --> 02:23.943
I'm just impressed
if I read a book a month.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.345
I'm sure you have
bigger priorities.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.948
Okay, now you're insulting me.
I got it.

02:28.982 --> 02:32.185
How do I know that girl
Vince is talking to?

02:32.219 --> 02:34.020
No clue.
I've never seen her.

02:34.054 --> 02:36.489
Sure you have.
That's Sasha grey.

02:36.523 --> 02:38.458
The porn star?!

02:38.492 --> 02:40.560
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

02:40.594 --> 02:43.663
And she did Soderbergh's
movie, so she's legit now.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.431
I read for that.

02:45.466 --> 02:49.102
- Yo, boys.
- Hey, Scotty!

02:49.136 --> 02:52.138
Hey, I want to thank you all for the
invite out with the internal crew.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.574
- It means a lot to me.
- Now that e can tolerate you.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.743
- You hear from Stamos?
- No. You believe it?

02:56.777 --> 02:58.911
The guy probably hasn't
even read the script yet.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.713
It's 40 pages.
How long could it take?

03:00.748 --> 03:03.282
Relax, drama. If he doesn't call
you by tomorrow, I'll call him.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.751
- Thanks, e.
- Where's Vince?

03:04.785 --> 03:07.253
At the bar
talking to Sasha grey.

03:07.287 --> 03:10.356
No. The anal
specialist, oh my God.

03:10.390 --> 03:13.426
<i>- Think Vince knows who she is?
- No way.</i>

03:13.460 --> 03:15.661
- Maybe we should tell him.
- He'll find out later.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.163
Way more fun coming from her.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.699
Actions do speak
louder than words.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.701
Oh God, I bet her ass
sings opera.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.237
<i>- I've never done the ass.</i>

03:24.271 --> 03:26.939
- Really? Oh, you should.
- Is it that great?

03:26.974 --> 03:30.243
Are you kidding?
Vagina's my third favorite hole, bro.

03:30.277 --> 03:32.378
- Nice.
- What about you, e?

03:32.412 --> 03:35.414
- None of your business.
- That's a no.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.583
- You an ass virgin, e?
- Yeah, drama, unlike you

03:37.618 --> 03:39.218
my ass remains untouched.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.487
Wait a minute, e.
You've gotta try it at least once

03:41.522 --> 03:43.289
before you get married.
You have to!

03:43.323 --> 03:44.924
Aw, Sloan's not
that kind of girl.

03:44.958 --> 03:47.727
- And I mean that in a good way.
- I'm not talking about Sloan.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.563
You gotta find, like, a civilian broad.
Get it out of your system.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.799
It's not in my system,
so let's move on.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.568
I'd like to stay right
here for a second, e,

03:55.602 --> 03:57.470
and I say this
with all due respect...

03:57.504 --> 04:00.907
if it's about Sloan or her ass,
please don't say anything at all.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.042
You gotta do it
before you get married.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.279
You wait 10 years to ask, she's gonna
think it's because you're not happy.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.881
Why don't you guys just worry
about the ass you're not getting?

04:08.916 --> 04:11.751
- Please.
- I'm getting closer by the minute.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.619
- With what?
- A cute girl.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.088
- Tell him. - Yeah, she's cute,
but he ain't getting any closer.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.591
<i>- We made out all night.</i>

04:18.625 --> 04:21.093
You made out all night where?
At the freshmen dance?

04:21.128 --> 04:23.596
It was a business meeting that
turned into a makeout session.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.498
Business he won't
tell us anything about.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.433
You'll hear about it
soon enough.

04:27.467 --> 04:30.403
- We're holding our breath.
- Guys, this is Sasha.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.271
Hey, how you doing?

04:32.306 --> 04:35.141
I just want to say I loved you
in "the girlfriend experience."

04:35.175 --> 04:37.143
- Thank you.
- How was working with Soderbergh?

04:37.177 --> 04:39.111
- Amazing.
- Yeah, I bet.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.613
<i>If it makes you feel
any better</i>

04:40.647 --> 04:43.049
I read for your old show five
times and didn't get it.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.885
- It does actually.
- If the roles were reversed

04:45.919 --> 04:48.387
we could have watched drama
in "the boyfriend experience."

04:48.422 --> 04:50.256
And all the hard research
leading up to it.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.359
<i>- She's funny, vin.
- And she reads.</i>

04:53.393 --> 04:56.762
Her porn name came from Oscar wilde's
"the picture of Dorian gray."

04:56.797 --> 04:59.532
<i>- How hot is that?
- I guess he does know who she is.</i>

05:00.834 --> 05:03.703
<i>- We're gonna take off.
Later.</i>

05:03.737 --> 05:05.771
He's got a big meeting tomorrow.
Don't keep him out too late.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.673
Don't worry.
We're going straight to bed.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.609
She's gonna give me
lessons in her craft.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.911
- That's fucked up.
- I got all her DVDs.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.881
I will give them to you so you can
see what you're missing tonight.

05:14.915 --> 05:18.017
Give them to e so he can see what
he's been missing his whole life.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.988
- Ow ow!
- Sorry, baby.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.957
- Why are you so angry?
- Do I seem angry?

05:27.394 --> 05:29.662
Sorry, I am a little bit angry, baby.

05:29.696 --> 05:33.065
- It's Lizzie Grant.
- You were thinking about her

05:33.100 --> 05:34.867
while you were
having sex with me?

05:34.902 --> 05:36.569
You think I'm happy about it?!

05:36.603 --> 05:39.205
- Do you have some confession
to make or something? - What?

05:39.239 --> 05:41.774
No, she's going after
my clients is all.

05:41.808 --> 05:45.244
Do you really think that she's a
viable candidate to replace you?

05:45.279 --> 05:48.047
Well, since the merger
and now with the N.F.L.,

05:48.081 --> 05:49.949
I've... I've neglected
some of them.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.318
Yeah, you've been neglecting
some other people too.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.654
- Who?
- Are you kidding me?

05:54.688 --> 05:56.422
Baby, we were just having sex.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.491
<i>- You were having sex.
- Oh, come...</i>

05:58.525 --> 06:01.127
that's what marriage is for, so
you can bang out your anger.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.829
- Oh my God.
- I'm sure you've done it to me, baby.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.465
You can't just leave me like this.
Come on!

06:07.401 --> 06:08.768
How am I gonna work?!

06:08.802 --> 06:11.170
Work yourself, Ari.

06:16.243 --> 06:18.311
Morning, Ari.
Why are you walking angry?

06:18.345 --> 06:21.113
- Has Lizzie Grant contacted any
of your clients? - No no no.

06:21.148 --> 06:24.583
- But I heard she's talking to Aaron Sorkin.
- I heard Jessica Simpson too.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.619
- Who is she working for?
- Mmmm.

06:26.653 --> 06:29.622
Okay, people,
we are at war here!

06:29.656 --> 06:33.326
Former colleague Lizzie Grant
is trying to take clients

06:33.360 --> 06:35.828
- from this agency.
- She called Mike Tyson.

06:35.862 --> 06:37.797
She's calling
the sports department.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.199
Okay, who is she working for?
C.A.A.?

06:40.233 --> 06:42.868
<i>I.C.M.?
Let's make it simple.</i>

06:42.903 --> 06:45.538
I have never allowed any agent

06:45.572 --> 06:47.707
to leave and take
a client with them.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.675
I'm not about
to allow it to happen today.

06:49.710 --> 06:53.813
Any one of your clients, I don't
care how big or how small,

06:53.847 --> 06:58.017
if they're wavering, tell me.
I will personally go and talk to them.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.986
Jake!

07:00.020 --> 07:02.355
Yes, Ari?

07:02.389 --> 07:05.224
You're about to witness
what made me who I am today.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.260
Call Aaron Sorkin, Mike Tyson
and Jessica Simpson.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.428
Now!

07:09.463 --> 07:12.198
- Who should I start with?
- Figure it out.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.569
You want to take me to the nuart
for a godard double feature?

07:16.603 --> 07:19.171
- You could use some culture.
- Who the fuck are you?

07:19.206 --> 07:22.341
Just a cool chick
who likes art and sex.

07:22.376 --> 07:25.811
Mmm, I know that's not drama's
crappy cooking I smell.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.813
I hope you like pancakes.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.616
I like the way they smell, so I'm
sure I'll like the way they taste.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.019
- Hey look, I got Mickey mouse.
- Aww.

07:33.053 --> 07:36.288
- What do you got for me?
- How about this one?

07:36.323 --> 07:39.125
- I'd prefer tits.
- That's fucking rude.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.662
- I'm kidding.
- She really is funny.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.932
- I think a sitcom's in my future.
- The next Mary Tyler Moore.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.701
<i>What do you
got there, turtle?</i>

07:48.735 --> 07:50.870
- My future.
- Tequila?

07:50.904 --> 07:53.572
- Yep.
- Ooh, I love tequila.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.441
- Bust it open.
- Now?

07:55.475 --> 07:57.843
- What better way to start the day?
- Totally.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.945
- Okay.
- So this is the business?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.415
Well, I wanted you
to taste it first

08:02.449 --> 08:04.884
so you could tell me if you
think there is a business.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.253
Oh, e called... wanted to make sure
you're gonna be at your meeting on time.

08:07.287 --> 08:10.556
Tell him I'm not.
But I will be.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.725
<i>Well, to a good meeting</i>

08:12.759 --> 08:14.493
that will lead
to a great movie.

08:14.528 --> 08:17.797
- Movies. Sounds like a franchise.
- Let's hope.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.435
- You like?
- That's very good.

08:22.469 --> 08:24.737
- Very smooth. - I'm not crazy, right?
It's good shit.

08:24.771 --> 08:27.073
- No, so what do they want you to do?
- Promote.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.041
Oh, you can definitely do that.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.010
Maybe you want to get
involved also?

08:31.044 --> 08:32.977
Sure.
What do you want me to do?

08:33.013 --> 08:35.948
- I'm gonna talk to e about that.
- Okay.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.217
Here's a good luck pancake.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.152
You are an artist.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.254
Cheers.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.823
Same.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.393
- One more.
- Yeah.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.261
<i>- One more, one more.
- You're drinking all my stuff.</i>

08:49.296 --> 08:52.698
Stamos is obviously not calling
me, so I need you to call him.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.700
<i>- I already left word.
- Well, leave word again!</i>

08:54.734 --> 08:57.369
- Because something's definitely up.
- Relax, drama!

08:57.404 --> 09:00.072
I can't relax, e.
I got no job, no auditions, nothing.

09:00.107 --> 09:03.275
I will call again and as soon as I
hear something I will call you back.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.545
<i>- Okay?
- Okay. Later.</i>

09:07.747 --> 09:09.482
- Morning, jennie.
- Morning.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.817
- Any word from stamos yet?
- Uh, no, but...

09:11.852 --> 09:14.353
Bizarrely enough, Bob
Saget is in your office.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.188
Why?

09:20.293 --> 09:23.562
<i>- Hey, Bob.
- Hey, Eric.</i>

09:23.597 --> 09:26.532
What kind of phone do you use?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.601
A blackberry.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.035
Blackberry?
Can I see it?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.937
<i>- Why?
- I'm thinking of switching</i>

09:31.972 --> 09:34.740
but I don't want to do anything
rash, so I want to see it first.

09:34.774 --> 09:36.342
- May I?
- Yeah sure.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.377
Thanks.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.882
- Christ.
- What?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.817
I have a blackberry, Eric.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.986
I rolled through your calls.
You haven't changed your number.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.722
I called you four times this
morning and you ignored me.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.725
I just walked in the door.
You were going to be my first call.

09:52.759 --> 09:56.529
You think if I call you four times, it
could maybe be something important?

09:56.563 --> 10:00.199
I don't call anybody four times in a
row unless I'm trying to fuck them.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.168
Bob, I'm here now,
so what's so important?

10:02.202 --> 10:04.537
- Sloan's on the phone.
- Tell her I'll call her back, please?

10:04.571 --> 10:06.305
She sounds
a little freaked out.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.808
Gotta take this, Bob.
You know how it is.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.377
Oh, please, be my guest.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.981
Hello?
Everything okay?

10:16.016 --> 10:17.883
- This is awkward.
- What is?

10:17.918 --> 10:21.620
I wasn't snooping.
I was just on looking for our registry

10:21.655 --> 10:24.957
and happened to see your
search history on the computer.

10:24.991 --> 10:27.927
<i>- Yeah, and?
- Did you Google anal sex?</i>

10:30.931 --> 10:33.365
- Uh...
- I mean, I hope it was for me

10:33.400 --> 10:34.667
and not someone else, 'cause...

10:34.701 --> 10:36.835
well yeah, I mean,
of course it was for you.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.871
I just... I thought maybe...

10:38.905 --> 10:40.506
maybe you wanted to try it.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.209
E, we've tried it once.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.010
You couldn't look at me.

10:45.045 --> 10:48.180
You just kept patting me on the
head saying you were sorry.

10:48.215 --> 10:52.117
Well yeah, I know. I thought maybe we were
doing it wrong so I googled the steps.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.385
Yeah, I read that.

10:53.420 --> 10:57.823
- Eric!
- Uh, Sloan, I have Bob Saget

10:57.857 --> 10:59.792
- in my office.
- Oh my God.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.695
<i>- Am I on speaker?
- No, but could we, uh,</i>

11:02.729 --> 11:04.496
could we talk
about this tonight?

11:04.531 --> 11:06.799
<i>- Maybe.
- Maybe?</i>

11:06.833 --> 11:08.834
Yeah, I might be
hiding from you tonight.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.903
Okay, I love you.
Bye.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.938
Love you.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.177
Were you just talking about
ass sex or something?

11:20.013 --> 11:23.315
- What can I do for you, Bob?
- I'll tell you what you can do for me, Eric.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.385
I read a script this morning...
a really great script.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.287
A friend gave it to me.
I want to do it.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.022
Okay, what is it?
I'll get right into it.

11:30.056 --> 11:33.726
- I've already gotten into it.
Stamos sent it to me. - Jesus.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.594
You sent it to stamos?

11:35.629 --> 11:39.398
Stamos and I have been trying to do something
together since "full house" ended.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.967
And now you... my manager
is trying to keep me from it?

11:42.002 --> 11:45.337
- Bob, that is not how it happened.
- I am perfect for this.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.641
- Phil Yagoda thinks so also.
- You spoke to Phil Yagoda?

11:48.675 --> 11:52.077
Yes, I did. Which means there's
no commission in this for you.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.614
And I still may even fire you.
I'm weighing my options.

11:57.851 --> 12:01.287
What I need really is
a steady respectable job.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.322
Something 9:00 to 5:00,
you know?

12:03.356 --> 12:05.758
- I need more structure in my life.
- I'm not following you.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.626
Are you talking about
something in sales?

12:07.661 --> 12:10.262
Because I think the intimidation
factor could work in your favor

12:10.297 --> 12:12.197
- or it could be a liability.
- No no.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.067
I want to do a real tv show.
A real one.

12:15.101 --> 12:17.102
Okay...

12:17.137 --> 12:19.004
- Uh...
- Scripted scripted.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.774
Scripted? Oh, I could see you
being like the next detective

12:21.808 --> 12:23.642
- on like a "C.S.I.," huh?
- No no.

12:23.677 --> 12:25.744
I want to do
the black "brady bunch."

12:25.779 --> 12:28.247
I'm trying to rehab my image.
I want to dispense

12:28.281 --> 12:31.450
some of this worldly wisdom that I
picked up on my journey in life.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.586
Then if Bobby doesn't listen
to you, you bite his ear off.

12:36.489 --> 12:39.191
- It was a joke, Mike.
- But it wasn't funny, Ari.

12:39.225 --> 12:40.826
- Okay?
- Well...

12:40.860 --> 12:44.029
- It just wasn't funny.
- Listen, I'm going to get into it.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.898
I also have a call
into Todd Phillips

12:45.932 --> 12:48.267
to make sure he puts you
in that "hangover" sequel.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.769
Hey, Todd Phillips knows not
to fuck me out of that sequel.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.672
I need more money and I need
more talking time.

12:53.707 --> 12:56.108
Listen, you got it.
I just need one thing from you.

12:56.142 --> 12:58.377
I need a commitment
to this agency.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.612
Don't fuck with me, all right?

13:00.647 --> 13:02.981
Let's not fuck each other.
There we go.

13:03.016 --> 13:06.151
- All right, you got it, buddy.
- Ari, Jessica Simpson's on one.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.721
Ooh, she'd be
a hot Carol Brady.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.622
Show me you're working for me.
Show me.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.726
Prove all that
lip service you've been giving me.

13:13.760 --> 13:17.529
- Jess, how are you? - Are you seriously
trying to summon me in for a meeting?

13:17.564 --> 13:20.532
- What? No. - I haven't heard
from you in over a year

13:20.567 --> 13:22.735
and your assistant said you want
me to come in for a meeting.

13:22.769 --> 13:25.204
I would love for you
to come in for a meeting.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.939
- Ask her.
- I just want to tell you

13:26.973 --> 13:29.341
how sorry I am about
the loss of your dog.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.877
- That was a year ago!
- It's still horrible.

13:31.911 --> 13:34.213
<i>And you never
called to say sorry.</i>

13:34.247 --> 13:37.116
Jess, I am... I am so...
I am so sorry.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.219
<i>- It's too late, Ari. I'm going with Lizzie.
- Go with her where?</i>

13:40.253 --> 13:41.954
<i>C.A.A.?</i>

13:41.988 --> 13:43.489
Jess?

13:43.523 --> 13:46.925
- Ask!
- What do you think about doing a remake

13:46.960 --> 13:49.328
of the "brady bunch"
with Mike Tyson

13:49.362 --> 13:52.664
as Mike Brady?
You love it?

13:52.699 --> 13:56.168
<i>- Okay, that's fantastic.
- Money in the bank, baby.</i>

13:58.571 --> 14:01.273
- Are you nervous?
- No, because you're coming with me.

14:01.307 --> 14:03.609
- Really?
- Unless you think you'll be bored?

14:03.643 --> 14:06.678
- I'm never bored. - Oh good, then
you can be my manager for the day.

14:06.713 --> 14:09.415
- Does that mean I get to tell
you what to do? - You can try,

14:09.449 --> 14:11.150
<i>- t I don't always listen.
- Really?</i>

14:11.184 --> 14:13.952
- That the shirt you're gonna wear?
- No good?

14:13.987 --> 14:16.889
I mean, it's cool, but you look
a little sloppy for a meeting.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.960
I'll be right back.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.896
I'll kill Bob Saget.

14:23.930 --> 14:26.765
No, I'm serious.
I will actually kill him.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.835
Did you talk to Phil
about this?

14:29.869 --> 14:32.004
- He's not returning my calls.
- Then I'll kill Phil.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.839
He's probably dealing
with the network.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.841
You have to learn to be
a little patient, drama.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.477
- Have you at least heard
from stamos? - Yes.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.345
He loves it and he would
do it with you,

14:40.380 --> 14:43.115
but he and Bob are best friends,
so what's he supposed to do?

14:43.149 --> 14:45.684
It's not called "show friends,"
it's called "show business"!

14:45.718 --> 14:47.686
<i>- Drama, you need to calm down.
- No no.</i>

14:47.720 --> 14:49.788
You've got to get up
and get angry.

14:49.823 --> 14:51.790
This script was written for me

14:51.825 --> 14:53.859
and Bob Saget steals it?!

14:56.129 --> 14:57.796
He's a fucking dead man.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.432
<i>He's a fucking dead man.</i>

15:00.467 --> 15:03.335
Drama, where are you going?

15:03.369 --> 15:05.103
To talk to Saget!

15:05.138 --> 15:07.840
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Do I ever?

15:08.808 --> 15:11.009
Eric, turtle's on the phone.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.911
Put it through.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.214
<i>- Hey, what's going on?
- Are you busy?</i>

15:15.248 --> 15:17.516
- Yeah, kind of. What's up?
- I need a meeting.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.750
<i>- With who?
- With you.</i>

15:18.785 --> 15:20.419
<i>- About what?
- About Vince.</i>

15:20.453 --> 15:22.554
Oh boy,
this doesn't sound good.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.823
Don't be so negative.
I want to take you for lunch.

15:24.858 --> 15:27.326
Just tell me what's going on.
I don't have time for lunch.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.628
<i>- Then I'll come there then.
- Don't come here!</i>

15:29.662 --> 15:31.396
- I'll see you in 20.
- Uh...

15:33.333 --> 15:35.734
It feels like old times.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.770
- You want a demotion?
- Oh, papa Ari is cranky

15:38.805 --> 15:40.906
because he hasn't chased
clients in a while.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.941
I'm not cranky.
I'm just in the zone.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.944
- Hide the dog. - He's a puppy, Ari.
Look at the little guy.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.813
Hide the dog.

15:50.884 --> 15:53.185
Look who it is... the guy
that used to be my agent.

15:53.219 --> 15:55.020
- That's not nice.
- I'm on a tight schedule,

15:55.054 --> 15:57.756
- so let's make the groveling quick.
- No groveling.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.259
- Just a gift.
- Ta-da!

16:00.293 --> 16:02.461
- What the hell?
- I know how devastated you were

16:02.495 --> 16:05.964
after losing little Daisy, so I thought
little rose here would ease the pain.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.900
- You really are an asshole.
- I know.

16:07.934 --> 16:11.336
I didn't call. I never called.
I don't deal well with death.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.472
- Have you ever had a dog, Ari?
- I-I have one now.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.174
You should know they're not like cars.
You don't just replace them.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.510
- Look how fluffy she is.
- Hi, I'm fluffy.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.480
- I've been talking to Lizzie.
- And who? Who's she with?

16:21.514 --> 16:23.782
- She seems to get me.
- She's a teenager.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.651
- And you clearly don't.
- Jess.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.086
And Daisy was a maltipoo.
That's just a poo.

16:29.188 --> 16:30.956
Asshole.

16:32.058 --> 16:33.792
You got her the wrong breed?

16:33.826 --> 16:36.962
- You gave me 30 minutes.
That's all they had. - Idiot.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.797
Can I keep him?
I'm already attached.

16:40.066 --> 16:42.367
I always wanted to fuck the
hulk when I was younger.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.002
- Is that weird?
- Uh, a little.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.104
What about aquaman?
You want to fuck him?

16:46.139 --> 16:48.140
- I liked the sequel better.
- Pfft.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.076
- I'm kidding.
- Look, the shocker.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.678
You're gross.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.180
- Oh, and you're so innocent.
- You're sick. You're sick.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.382
- An innocent girl, huh?
- You're sick.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.652
Vince, Randall and Stan
are ready for you.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.287
We're ready for them.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.388
Yeah...

17:06.559 --> 17:08.492
<i>- Vinnie chase!
- Hey, Randall.</i>

17:08.528 --> 17:09.994
- So good to see you again.
- You too.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.964
- This is Sasha. - And this is
the man, the myth, the legend,

17:12.999 --> 17:14.700
- Stan Lee.
- Hi.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.835
- So nice to meet you, Stan.
- Oh, you as well.

17:16.868 --> 17:20.606
And sasha...
oh, you look familiar.

17:20.640 --> 17:24.242
Well, Sasha just did Steven Soderbergh's
"the girlfriend experience."

17:24.277 --> 17:27.378
Oh, I didn't see that.
What else have you done?

17:27.413 --> 17:30.449
- I've done a bunch of stuff.
- Really? Anything I've seen?

17:30.483 --> 17:33.018
Uh, she's done
dozens of independents.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.654
<i>At your age?
Boy, that's terrific.</i>

17:38.524 --> 17:40.659
Get down here, Bob,
and take your beating.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.995
Drama, you're acting insane.
Put the bat down.

17:43.029 --> 17:45.330
Yeah, leave him alone.
Bob is a good man.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.566
Yeah, a good man who's
trying to steal my life!

17:47.600 --> 17:50.035
<i>- I didn't steal anything!
- Oh yeah?</i>

17:50.069 --> 17:52.204
A guy writes a script for me,

17:52.238 --> 17:54.473
and you just swoop in
and take it?

17:55.775 --> 17:58.577
Now get down here before
I start smashing cars!

17:58.611 --> 18:01.079
Please don't hit the volkswagen!
That one is mine.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.615
<i>Who says he wrote it for you?</i>

18:03.650 --> 18:06.051
Roger Jay says.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.920
- The writer?
- I know Roger, drama.

18:08.955 --> 18:11.056
He told that to everybody.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.859
He gave it to me six months ago.
I just never opened it.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.460
Yeah right!

18:15.495 --> 18:17.429
Come inside.
We'll call Roger together.

18:17.463 --> 18:20.165
- I'll prove it to you.
- Are you kidding?

18:20.199 --> 18:22.567
My hand to God.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.304
Jesus Christ.

18:26.339 --> 18:29.374
I'll give you a blowjob if
it'll make you feel better.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.511
What? I'm just trying to
make him feel better.

18:32.545 --> 18:35.514
I've got Sunnin
coming in for lunch.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.349
Great kebabs.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.418
I don't want kebabs, Bob.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.486
I want a life.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.689
I'm sorry, drama.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.791
I really am.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.360
- Are you out of your mind?
- You're not even listening to me.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.829
I heard every word you said,
turtle, not one of which I like.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.564
- Why not?
- Because Vince isn't going

18:52.598 --> 18:55.233
to be the face of some tequila company.
He's not aunt jemima.

18:55.268 --> 18:58.003
You know, I could have just asked
him, skipped right over you.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.738
And I appreciate that,
but still.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.907
He just gave you 30 grand
for your car service.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.408
The car service ain't working.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.744
I'm sorry about that.
I know how hard you tried.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.080
Can you at least consider how
hard I would try on this?

19:08.114 --> 19:10.215
Okay, I just got off the
phone with Randall Wallace.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.551
<i>- How'd the meeting go?
- Not great.</i>

19:12.585 --> 19:14.386
- Vince brought Sasha.
- Come on.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.655
- Yeah, and apparently he was drunk.
- Drunk?

19:16.689 --> 19:18.390
Vince?

19:19.559 --> 19:21.560
I wasn't drunk.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.695
<i>Well, they said you
smelled like Mexico.</i>

19:23.730 --> 19:26.264
That's 'cause I had some of
turtle's tequila for breakfast.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.166
<i>But I totally sobered up
before I got there.</i>

19:28.201 --> 19:30.268
<i>I'm not dumb enough to go
to a meeting drunk, e.</i>

19:30.303 --> 19:33.472
- Yeah, but you're dumb enough to
bring a porn star.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.308
I told you.
Stan Lee totally knew who you were.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.377
I know. I saw the moment when he
placed me... he turned beet red.

19:39.412 --> 19:42.013
- All right, so what did he say?
- They'd like you for the movie,

19:42.048 --> 19:45.150
but they've seen a lot of fuck-ups in
this town and they're concerned, Vince.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.519
E, the truth is I had
a Vicodin this morning,

19:47.553 --> 19:50.088
<i>which I wouldn't have had
if I knew I'd be drinking.</i>

19:50.123 --> 19:53.959
- Why'd you take a Vicodin?
- My back... it's been hurting since the accident.

19:53.993 --> 19:57.229
E, just tell him I'm fine.
I'll go back, I'll meet him again.

19:57.263 --> 20:00.565
I told him you were fine.
I also told him we needed an offer immediately.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.567
Oooh, I like
the aggressive attitude.

20:02.602 --> 20:05.437
<i>- All right, I'll talk to you later.
- Later.</i>

20:09.075 --> 20:11.176
Would you at least try this?

20:12.345 --> 20:13.812
- I don't have to be involved?
- Yes.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.547
I don't know why you're
being so aggressive.

20:15.581 --> 20:17.349
I'm just...
is Andrew coming back?

20:17.383 --> 20:20.719
- Have we not a had a good six months without him?
- Answer the fucking question.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.622
No, he is not coming back.
He is a coke-fiend sex addict

20:23.656 --> 20:26.792
who wrote checks out of this
company's account to buy hookers.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.727
So no, he will never
work here again.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.062
Addiction's a disease.
You have no sympathy.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.365
I have sympathy.
I'm just trying to help your career.

20:33.399 --> 20:36.301
- My career's in great shape.
- It's gotten even better since you got here, right?

20:36.335 --> 20:38.703
- I like that Lizzie.
- Well don't, because she's bad news.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.273
If I've gotta have an agent, why
can't I have one who's attractive

20:41.307 --> 20:44.509
- and bright and attractive?
- You know she's not gonna fuck you, right?

20:44.544 --> 20:46.178
I'm certain that's not
what I meant.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.146
- You know she fucked Andrew?
- Seriously?

20:48.181 --> 20:50.048
That's what caused
his whole spiral.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.185
It wasn't the drugs.
It was her evil pussy that lured him in.

20:53.219 --> 20:54.786
That's why I have no sympathy.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.621
I know,
but you're still a douche

20:56.656 --> 20:59.224
and I don't need your help
getting work or laid.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.859
Where'd she go?
She go to u.T.A.?

21:00.893 --> 21:03.495
I'm... I'm sorry.
Ari, Jessica Simpson's here.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.297
- Right now?
- Yes, what should I tell her?

21:05.331 --> 21:07.365
Tell her I'll be with her
in one second.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.435
I'm glad I'm leaving, that way you don't
have to end my meeting early for a pop star.

21:10.469 --> 21:13.004
She acts as well, by the way.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.407
<i>- She looks great.
- She looks perfect.</i>

21:15.441 --> 21:17.509
And she's single.
You know what John Mayer said about her.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.945
- No, I don't and you're an animal.
- Sexual napalm.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.980
You love the smell
of napalm in the morning.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.115
- It smells like victory.
- All right.

21:24.150 --> 21:27.552
Jessica!
You changed your mind.

21:27.587 --> 21:29.020
- I'm working on her, Ari.
- Go.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.423
I can't stop thinking about the dog.
I want him.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.491
Come in, come in.
I want you to meet someone.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.660
Jessica, this is
the great Aaron sorkin.

21:35.695 --> 21:37.929
- Hi, it's really nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

21:37.964 --> 21:40.265
I saw the previews for "the social network.
" It looks great.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.267
That's really nice of you
to say... and it's actually

21:42.301 --> 21:44.436
- more than Ari's had to say about it.
- What are you talking about?

21:44.470 --> 21:46.972
I'm now on Facebook because of you.
I got 600 friends.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.673
And John Mayer's
not one of them.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.876
How many of those friends
actually like you, Ari?

21:50.910 --> 21:52.944
- I've set the over-under at none.
- Wow.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.913
You two play off
each other really well.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.816
I say you kids go to dinner
and possibly you write something

21:57.850 --> 22:00.318
serious for her,
like Mariah in "precious,"

22:00.353 --> 22:02.787
only she's younger and southern.
It'll be amazing.

22:02.822 --> 22:06.091
- I may have a better idea.
Are you free? - Yeah, absolutely.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.126
- I want the dog.
- I want a commitment

22:08.160 --> 22:10.762
from both of you that you will
stay with this agency.

22:10.796 --> 22:13.531
- For now.
- Where's the dog?

22:13.566 --> 22:15.200
Lloyd!

22:17.970 --> 22:21.006
- Isn't he delicious?
- Find something else to cook for dinner.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.641
- Jessica's taking him.
- No...

22:22.675 --> 22:24.943
- Here we go, honey.
- Hi.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.211
- Huh?
- Hi.

22:26.245 --> 22:28.280
Perfection.
Take a picture, Lloyd.

22:28.314 --> 22:31.049
Take a picture.
Look at that.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.817
Any word when he'll be in?

22:32.852 --> 22:35.787
He hasn't checked in.
I'm sorry, you really should go.

22:35.821 --> 22:38.590
- I got nowhere to be.
- What are you doing here, drama?

22:38.624 --> 22:40.725
I'm not doing anything.
What are you doing here?

22:40.760 --> 22:42.928
I came here to make sure you
didn't do anything stupid.

22:42.962 --> 22:45.230
- Phil's not here. - Yeah, I know.
I spoke to him.

22:45.264 --> 22:48.900
- Where is he? - He's been
battling with the network all day.

22:48.935 --> 22:51.803
They want Saget.

22:51.837 --> 22:54.839
- I wish I could've done more.
- I'm not mad at you, e.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.742
I'm not even mad at Saget.

22:57.777 --> 23:01.279
It's that piece-of-shit
writer I want dead.

23:01.314 --> 23:02.781
You just gotta let it go.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.350
I mean, you were too good-looking
for that part anyway.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.053
- Yeah.
- What part was that?

23:13.626 --> 23:15.927
<i>♪ First off,
it's the righteous baby... ♪</i>

23:15.962 --> 23:18.697
<i>- go! - ♪ See how some
girls go crazy... ♪</i>

23:18.731 --> 23:21.566
you're too good.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.935
- Hey, turtle.
- What up?

23:23.970 --> 23:26.071
I gotta say
I'm loving this tequila.

23:26.105 --> 23:27.939
We're gonna have
to get some more.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.308
That may have been
the last case.

23:30.343 --> 23:32.610
Bummer!
Why?

23:34.146 --> 23:36.247
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

23:36.282 --> 23:39.017
E says you had a rough day.
Are you okay?

23:39.051 --> 23:41.720
- Don't I look okay?
- Yeah.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.688
- I guess you do.
- Well, good!

23:43.723 --> 23:46.491
Come, drink!
Tell us your troubles.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.099
Jesus, what are you doing here?

23:54.133 --> 23:57.435
I saved the most important
meeting of the day for last.

23:57.470 --> 23:58.937
- Well, you seem happy.
- I am.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.538
I set out to conquer and I did.

24:00.573 --> 24:03.441
- It seems I can still hustle.
- You haven't sold me yet.

24:03.476 --> 24:06.578
- Let me show you how much you mean to me.
- Maybe I want to hear it.

24:06.612 --> 24:09.080
I... ba... can we do it after?
I can't focus.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.182
I still have blue balls
from this morning.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.885
- You lost your hustle.
- I love you.

24:13.919 --> 24:17.822
You are the most important
person in the world to me.

24:17.857 --> 24:20.759
<i>I'm sorry that
I take you for granted.</i>

24:20.793 --> 24:24.262
I owe everything to you
and you're beautiful.

24:24.296 --> 24:27.065
Okay, you can tell me more
after we're done.

24:28.768 --> 24:31.636
- Wow.
- Mmm.

24:38.277 --> 24:41.079
<i>- Please stop ringing.</i>

24:42.148 --> 24:43.381
What are you doing, baby?

24:43.416 --> 24:45.617
I'm giving you a taste
of your own medicine.

24:45.651 --> 24:48.586
- Hello? - Hi, I have Amanda
Daniels calling for Ari.

24:48.621 --> 24:51.256
Just a second.
Amanda Daniels.

24:54.860 --> 24:56.895
Hello.

24:56.929 --> 24:59.631
<i>- Good evening, Ari.
- Please don't tell me you're the one</i>

24:59.665 --> 25:02.300
who picked up the stray Lizzie
from the harsh gutter of life.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.969
I couldn't believe someone who's
always had such an eye for talent

25:05.004 --> 25:06.671
was willing to let her go.

25:06.705 --> 25:09.374
<i>I think your eye has
grown cataracts,</i>

25:09.408 --> 25:11.476
because as you've seen
by the day's events,

25:11.510 --> 25:13.778
anyone she wants or has,

25:13.813 --> 25:17.449
be it a sitcom actor or a
circus freak, I'm going after.

25:17.483 --> 25:19.651
Well, she's going
after you too, Ari.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.020
<i>- And I'm gonna help her.
- How's that?</i>

25:22.054 --> 25:23.988
I've been watching Lizzie
for a while.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.524
I actually offered her
a job six months ago.

25:26.559 --> 25:30.361
She turned me down, said the future
looked very bright with you.

25:30.396 --> 25:34.833
I said, okay, perhaps.
But in case you're wrong, just keep a journal,

25:34.867 --> 25:38.269
<i>write down everything
that goes on over there.</i>

25:38.304 --> 25:40.004
<i>So she did.</i>

25:40.039 --> 25:42.674
- So what? - So I'm going
to make your life miserable

25:42.708 --> 25:44.409
like you once made mine.

25:44.443 --> 25:45.610
Good night, Ari.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.815
- What was that all about? - Nothing.
Baby, let's go back to us.

25:50.850 --> 25:53.017
- Are you angry?
- Uh-huh.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.453
I think I'll take a rain check.

26:00.092 --> 26:02.560
I've already disappointed
enough people today.

26:02.595 --> 26:04.996
- We don't have to do this.
- Don't move.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.332
It says I move, you stay.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.100
I'm staying.

26:09.135 --> 26:11.870
You sure we shouldn't go back and
spend a little more time on step one?

26:11.904 --> 26:13.938
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

26:16.041 --> 26:17.742
- Is it in?
- Yes.

26:17.776 --> 26:19.477
- You sure?
- Shhh.

26:23.682 --> 26:25.817
- Are you kidding?
- What?

26:25.851 --> 26:28.319
I just want you to take your time.
I don't want to bug you.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.288
<i>- Focus.</i>

26:30.322 --> 26:32.123
<i>- You're mean.</i>

26:32.158 --> 26:34.859
- Ow!
- Seriously?

26:34.894 --> 26:37.295
- You' strangling it!
- Deal.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.397
- We are going to do this.
- We don't have to.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.332
Don't be a pussy.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.603
Ow, motherfucker!

26:45.638 --> 26:48.106
- Oh my God, I am so sorry.
- Why did you do that?

26:48.140 --> 26:49.607
Well, you called me a pussy.

26:53.379 --> 26:55.580
What are we doing?

26:55.614 --> 26:58.449
I don't know. I like your vagina.
Is that so wrong?

26:58.484 --> 27:00.251
No.

27:02.588 --> 27:05.089
Oh my God, I need another shot.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.025
Pour me one too.

27:07.059 --> 27:09.394
<i>- Are you sure you're okay?</i>

27:09.428 --> 27:12.363
Uh, no.
Here's your phone.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.465
I'll be lying here recovering.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.634
- Hey, what's up, Vince?
- Don't be mad, e.

27:16.669 --> 27:19.437
<i>- This doesn't sound good.
- Turtle did not betray you.</i>

27:19.471 --> 27:21.973
- I got it out of him.
- Are you drunk again?

27:22.007 --> 27:24.242
No no no, it's not drunk.
It's like a high.

27:24.276 --> 27:27.078
This tequila's special and...

27:27.112 --> 27:28.513
I want to be involved.

27:28.547 --> 27:30.348
<i>Can we talk
about this tomorrow?</i>

27:30.382 --> 27:32.150
There's nothing
to talk about, e.

27:32.184 --> 27:35.620
We take care of our own
and turtle is one of ours.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.789
Good night.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.427
You look like I feel.
