WEBVTT

00:07.999 --> 00:07.999
 Lemonis:

00:07.999 --> 00:07.999
TONIGHT ON "THE PROFIT"...

00:08.999 --> 00:10.999
Andreas: MEAT IN THE GYRO?

00:10.999 --> 00:11.999
Lemonis:

00:10.999 --> 00:11.999
...MY BIG FAT GREEK GYRO

00:11.999 --> 00:14.999
IS A SMALL FRANCHISE

00:11.999 --> 00:14.999
WITH A GROWING FOOTPRINT.

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
ARE YOU GUYS STILL IN LOVE

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
WITH THIS BUSINESS?

00:16.999 --> 00:18.000
-Mike: I AM.

00:16.999 --> 00:18.000
-Kathleen: I AM.

00:18.999 --> 00:20.999
Lemonis: ALREADY, THERE ARE

00:18.999 --> 00:20.999
FIVE LOCATIONS UP AND RUNNING.

00:20.999 --> 00:22.999
-HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

00:20.999 --> 00:22.999
-Jace: A LITTLE OVER 3 YEARS.

00:22.999 --> 00:25.999
Lemonis: AND AS THE BUSINESS

00:22.999 --> 00:25.999
HAS GROWN, SO HAVE THE PROBLEMS.

00:25.999 --> 00:26.999
Mike: YOU'RE MY PARTNER.

00:26.999 --> 00:27.999
YOU CAN PICK UP THE SLACK,

00:26.999 --> 00:27.999
AS WELL.

00:27.999 --> 00:29.999
Kathleen:

00:27.999 --> 00:29.999
YOU'RE GONNA PUT IT ON ME NOW?

00:29.999 --> 00:31.999
Lemonis: HUSBAND-AND-WIFE TEAM

00:29.999 --> 00:31.999
WHO STARTED IT

00:31.999 --> 00:32.999
HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO RUN IT.

00:32.999 --> 00:35.999
Rich: I'VE LOST RESPECT FOR MIKE

00:32.999 --> 00:35.999
AS AN INDIVIDUAL.

00:35.999 --> 00:36.999
Lemonis:

00:35.999 --> 00:36.999
THEIR FOOD MISSES THE MARK.

00:36.999 --> 00:37.999
THEY'RE ACTUALLY TERRIBLE.

00:37.999 --> 00:38.999
Andreas: YOU DON'T LIKE THEM?

00:38.999 --> 00:39.999
Lemonis: NO.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.999
THEIR BRANDING

00:40.000 --> 00:41.999
IS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

00:41.999 --> 00:43.999
HAMBURGERS AND HOT DOGS?

00:43.999 --> 00:45.999
AND THE FRANCHISEES

00:43.999 --> 00:45.999
AREN'T GETTING ANYTHING CLOSE

00:45.999 --> 00:47.999
TO THE HELP THEY NEED.

00:47.999 --> 00:48.999
Kane: THE ONLY HELP

00:47.999 --> 00:48.999
WE EVER GOT FROM THEM

00:48.999 --> 00:50.999
WAS ON THE FIRST OF THE MONTH,

00:50.999 --> 00:51.999
THEY CAME AND PICKED UP

00:50.999 --> 00:51.999
THEIR ROYALTY CHECK.

00:51.999 --> 00:54.999
Lemonis:

00:51.999 --> 00:54.999
FOR THIS BUSINESS TO SURVIVE,

00:54.999 --> 00:57.999
I'LL HAVE TO PUT A CLEAR PROCESS

00:54.999 --> 00:57.999
IN PLACE AND FIX WHAT'S BROKEN.

00:57.999 --> 00:59.999
YOU CAN'T TELL SOMEBODY ELSE

00:57.999 --> 00:59.999
HOW TO RUN THEIR HOUSE

00:59.999 --> 01:01.999
WHEN YOU CAN'T RUN

00:59.999 --> 01:01.999
YOUR OWN HOUSE RIGHT.

01:01.999 --> 01:04.998
OTHERWISE, THIS WOULD-BE EMPIRE

01:04.998 --> 01:06.999
WILL BE A BIG, FAT BUST.

01:06.999 --> 01:07.999
Kathleen: TELL HIM,

01:06.999 --> 01:07.999
"THIS IS MY LIVELIHOOD."

01:07.999 --> 01:09.999
Lemonis:

01:07.999 --> 01:09.999
MY NAME IS MARCUS LEMONIS,

01:09.999 --> 01:11.999
AND I FIX FAILING BUSINESSES.

01:11.999 --> 01:15.999
IF YOU DON'T LIKE MONEY,

01:11.999 --> 01:15.999
DON'T FOLLOW MY PROCESS.

01:15.999 --> 01:16.999
I MAKE THE TOUGH DECISIONS.

01:16.999 --> 01:18.999
WE'RE CLOSING THE STORE.

01:16.999 --> 01:18.999
WE'RE DONE.

01:18.999 --> 01:20.999
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT IT

01:18.999 --> 01:20.999
ANYMORE.

01:20.999 --> 01:23.999
I BACK THEM UP,

01:20.999 --> 01:23.999
SPENDING MY OWN MONEY.

01:23.999 --> 01:25.999
IT'S NOT ALWAYS PRETTY...

01:25.999 --> 01:26.999
Man: PERFECT FLAVOR.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.999
Lemonis:

01:26.999 --> 01:28.999
...BUT THIS IS BUSINESS.

01:28.999 --> 01:29.999
YOU GOT TO TRUST THE PROCESS.

01:29.999 --> 01:32.999
I DO IT TO SAVE JOBS,

01:29.999 --> 01:32.999
AND I DO IT TO MAKE MONEY.

01:32.999 --> 01:33.999
THANKS FOR YOUR BUSINESS.

01:33.999 --> 01:36.999
THIS IS "THE PROFIT."

01:41.999 --> 01:43.999
JUST ABOUT 15 MILES

01:41.999 --> 01:43.999
SOUTH OF PITTSBURGH

01:44.000 --> 01:46.999
IN A SMALL TOWN

01:44.000 --> 01:46.999
CALLED McMURRAY, PENNSYLVANIA,

01:46.999 --> 01:49.999
THERE'S A FAST CASUAL RESTAURANT

01:46.999 --> 01:49.999
KNOWN AS MY BIG FAT GREEK GYRO.

01:49.999 --> 01:51.999
Michael:

01:49.999 --> 01:51.999
WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU?

01:51.999 --> 01:52.999
Woman: GYRO AND FRIES.

01:52.999 --> 01:55.999
Lemonis:

01:52.999 --> 01:55.999
HUSBAND AND WIFE MIKE FERENCE

01:52.999 --> 01:55.999
AND KATHLEEN KAMOYEROU...

01:55.999 --> 01:57.999
Kathleen:

01:55.999 --> 01:57.999
THEY PREFER OUR SAUCE.

01:57.999 --> 01:59.999
Lemonis: ...STARTED THE BUSINESS

01:57.999 --> 01:59.999
10 YEARS AGO.

01:59.999 --> 02:01.999
KATHLEEN'S PARENTS EMIGRATED

01:59.999 --> 02:01.999
FROM GREECE.

02:01.999 --> 02:04.999
Man: WE USED TO MAKE THE GYRO

02:01.999 --> 02:04.999
BY HAND.

02:04.999 --> 02:06.999
Lemonis: AND SHE WANTED

02:04.999 --> 02:06.999
TO CELEBRATE THE CULTURE

02:06.999 --> 02:08.999
AND ENJOY THE FOOD

02:06.999 --> 02:08.999
SHE GREW UP WITH.

02:08.999 --> 02:09.999
Man: IT'S ONE OF THE BEST.

02:08.999 --> 02:09.999
PERIOD.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.999
Lemonis: AND MIKE WANTED

02:10.000 --> 02:11.999
TO TURN THE GYRO

02:11.999 --> 02:15.000
INTO THE NEXT BIG THING

02:11.999 --> 02:15.000
IN FAST CASUAL DINING.

02:15.999 --> 02:16.999
THEY'VE ALREADY SOLD

02:15.999 --> 02:16.999
FOUR FRANCHISES

02:16.999 --> 02:18.999
AROUND

02:16.999 --> 02:18.999
THE GREATER PITTSBURGH AREA.

02:18.999 --> 02:20.999
Andreas: IF YOU COULD

02:18.999 --> 02:20.999
JUST SIGN THAT FOR ME.

02:20.999 --> 02:23.999
Lemonis: AND NOW KATHLEEN'S

02:20.999 --> 02:23.999
SONS, MICHAEL AND ANDREAS,

02:23.999 --> 02:26.999
ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BUYING

02:23.999 --> 02:26.999
THE ORIGINAL FLAGSHIP STORE.

02:26.999 --> 02:28.999
Andreas:

02:26.999 --> 02:28.999
IT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GOT

02:28.999 --> 02:30.999
TWO YOUNG, STRONG BULLS

02:28.999 --> 02:30.999
WHO ARE READY TO TAKE THE HORNS.

02:30.999 --> 02:32.999
Lemonis: BUT THE FRANCHISES

02:30.999 --> 02:32.999
ARE UNDER-PERFORMING,

02:32.999 --> 02:35.999
AND THERE'S CONFUSION

02:32.999 --> 02:35.999
ABOUT HOW TO GROW.

02:35.999 --> 02:37.999
Andreas:

02:35.999 --> 02:37.999
MIKE -- HE'S NOT INVOLVED.

02:37.999 --> 02:40.999
Lemonis: I LOVE THE CONCEPT,

02:37.999 --> 02:40.999
AND MY DAD IS GREEK,

02:40.999 --> 02:43.999
AND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED

02:40.999 --> 02:43.999
TO FIND AN OPPORTUNITY

02:43.999 --> 02:44.999
TO SHARE MY CULTURE.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.999
IF THIS FAMILY TAKES MY LEAD,

02:46.999 --> 02:50.999
I BELIEVE WE CAN TAKE THIS

02:46.999 --> 02:50.999
FRANCHISE TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

02:57.999 --> 02:59.999
-HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

02:57.999 --> 02:59.999
-Andreas: GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

02:59.999 --> 03:00.999
-Lemonis: I'M MARCUS.

02:59.999 --> 03:00.999
-Andreas: I'M ANDREAS.

03:00.999 --> 03:02.999
-Lemonis: NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:00.999 --> 03:02.999
-Andreas: NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:02.999 --> 03:03.999
Lemonis:

03:02.999 --> 03:03.999
IT WAS KIND OF HARD TO FIND.

03:03.999 --> 03:05.999
Andreas: YEAH, IT IS.

03:03.999 --> 03:05.999
IT'S A HIDDEN TREASURE.

03:05.999 --> 03:06.999
THIS IS MY MOTHER.

03:06.999 --> 03:08.999
-Lemonis: [ SPEAKS GREEK ]

03:06.999 --> 03:08.999
-Andreas: [ SPEAKS GREEK ]

03:08.999 --> 03:09.999
THIS IS MY BROTHER, MICHAEL,

03:08.999 --> 03:09.999
BY THE WAY.

03:09.999 --> 03:11.999
Lemonis: HOW YOU DOING, MICHAEL?

03:11.999 --> 03:12.999
Andreas: THIS IS MY STEPDAD.

03:12.999 --> 03:13.999
-THIS IS BIG MIKE.

03:12.999 --> 03:13.999
-Mike: MIKE FERENCE.

03:13.999 --> 03:14.999
-Lemonis: HOW YOU DOING, MIKE?

03:13.999 --> 03:14.999
-Michael: MY PLEASURE.

03:14.999 --> 03:16.999
Lemonis: NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:14.999 --> 03:16.999
I'M MARCUS.

03:16.999 --> 03:17.999
-Mike: PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

03:16.999 --> 03:17.999
-Andreas: COME ON IN.

03:19.999 --> 03:21.999
-Lemonis: YOU GUYS ARE MARRIED.

03:19.999 --> 03:21.999
-Mike: WE ARE.

03:21.999 --> 03:22.999
Lemonis: SO, YOU OWN

03:21.999 --> 03:22.999
THE BUSINESS TOGETHER.

03:22.999 --> 03:24.999
Kathleen: TOGETHER.

03:22.999 --> 03:24.999
WE'RE PARTNERS.

03:24.999 --> 03:26.999
Mike: AND THEN WE'RE GONNA

03:24.999 --> 03:26.999
CONCENTRATE

03:26.999 --> 03:27.999
HOPEFULLY MORE ON FRANCHISES.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.999
-Lemonis: LEGITIMATE FRANCHISES?

03:27.999 --> 03:29.999
-Mike: LEGITIMATE FRANCHISES.

03:29.999 --> 03:31.999
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE

03:29.999 --> 03:31.999
A 10-YEAR FRANCHISE AGREEMENT

03:31.999 --> 03:33.999
WITH US WHERE THEY PAY

03:31.999 --> 03:33.999
AN UP-FRONT FEE.

03:33.999 --> 03:34.999
Lemonis: HOW MUCH WAS THAT?

03:34.999 --> 03:35.999
Mike: IT'S $10,000 PER STORE.

03:35.999 --> 03:38.999
AND THEN THEY PAY

03:35.999 --> 03:38.999
AN ONGOING ROYALTY FEE, AS WELL.

03:38.999 --> 03:39.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

03:39.999 --> 03:42.999
FRANCHISING IS AN INCREDIBLY

03:39.999 --> 03:42.999
ATTRACTIVE BUSINESS MODEL

03:42.999 --> 03:44.999
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU

03:42.999 --> 03:44.999
TO GET PAID

03:44.999 --> 03:45.999
ONCE YOU PERFECT A CONCEPT.

03:45.999 --> 03:49.999
MY BIG FAT GREEK GYRO

03:45.999 --> 03:49.999
ONLY GETS ABOUT $10,000

03:49.999 --> 03:51.999
WHEN THEY SIGN UP

03:49.999 --> 03:51.999
A NEW FRANCHISE.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
IN SUCCESS,

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
THAT FEE COULD GROW MUCH HIGHER.

03:53.999 --> 03:55.999
BETTER STILL,

03:53.999 --> 03:55.999
EACH OF YOUR FRANCHISEES

03:55.999 --> 03:58.999
PAY THE OWNER A ROYALTY

03:55.999 --> 03:58.999
ON A MONTHLY BASIS.

03:58.999 --> 04:01.999
THAT COULD BE ANYWHERE

03:58.999 --> 04:01.999
BETWEEN 4% AND 12%

04:01.999 --> 04:02.999
OF YOUR MONTHLY SALES.

04:02.999 --> 04:05.999
Mike: RIGHT NOW WE'RE MAKING

04:02.999 --> 04:05.999
ABOUT $60,000, $65,000

04:05.999 --> 04:06.999
ANNUALLY ON ROYALTIES.

04:06.999 --> 04:08.999
Lemonis:

04:06.999 --> 04:08.999
THEY PAY AN UP-FRONT FEE.

04:08.999 --> 04:09.999
Mike: CORRECT.

04:09.999 --> 04:10.999
Lemonis:

04:09.999 --> 04:10.999
YOU CONTROL THE BRANDING.

04:10.999 --> 04:11.999
Mike: CORRECT.

04:11.999 --> 04:13.999
Lemonis:

04:11.999 --> 04:13.999
WHO PICKS THE LOCATIONS?

04:13.999 --> 04:16.000
WHO GOES OUT AND VETS IT

04:13.999 --> 04:16.000
'CAUSE IT'S YOUR BRAND?

04:16.999 --> 04:17.999
Mike: I DO.

04:17.999 --> 04:20.999
Lemonis:

04:17.999 --> 04:20.999
WHO DEVELOPED THE MENU?

04:20.999 --> 04:22.999
Kathleen: WE DID.

04:22.999 --> 04:25.999
Lemonis: I WAS GONNA TAKE A TRIP

04:22.999 --> 04:25.999
TO GREECE THIS SUMMER,

04:25.999 --> 04:28.999
AND I'M LOOKING

04:25.999 --> 04:28.999
FOR TATER TOTS...

04:28.999 --> 04:31.999
CHEESE STICKS,

04:28.999 --> 04:31.999
CHEDDAR BALLS, MUSHROOMS.

04:31.999 --> 04:33.999
-HUMMUS ISN'T GREEK.

04:31.999 --> 04:33.999
-Andreas: LEBANESE.

04:33.999 --> 04:36.999
Lemonis: WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY

04:33.999 --> 04:36.999
MAKE YOURSELF?

04:36.999 --> 04:38.000
Mike:

04:36.999 --> 04:38.000
WE HAVE THE TRADITIONAL GYRO.

04:38.999 --> 04:40.999
WE HAVE STEAK.

04:38.999 --> 04:40.999
WE HAVE FRESH CHICKEN.

04:40.999 --> 04:42.999
AND THEN WE HAVE SOUVLAKI,

04:40.999 --> 04:42.999
WHICH IS A PORK.

04:42.999 --> 04:44.999
AND YOU CAN EITHER HAVE A

04:42.999 --> 04:44.999
SANDWICH, A SALAD, OR A PLATTER.

04:44.999 --> 04:46.999
Lemonis: DO YOU KNOW HOW TO

04:44.999 --> 04:46.999
HAND-ROLL GRAPE LEAVES?

04:46.999 --> 04:47.999
Mike: ABSOLUTELY, WE DO.

04:47.999 --> 04:49.999
Kathleen:

04:47.999 --> 04:49.999
YEAH, BUT WE BUY THEM FROZEN.

04:49.999 --> 04:52.999
Mike: WE DON'T HAVE

04:49.999 --> 04:52.999
THE SQUARE FOOTAGE FOR IT.

04:52.999 --> 04:54.999
Kathleen: YEAH, YOU CAN'T --

04:52.999 --> 04:54.999
DID YOU SEE OUR KITCHEN?

04:54.999 --> 04:55.999
Mike: HERE,

04:54.999 --> 04:55.999
WE'LL SHOW YOU THE KITCHEN.

04:55.999 --> 04:56.999
YOU'LL GET

04:55.999 --> 04:56.999
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING.

04:56.999 --> 04:59.999
Kathleen: THIS IS OUR KITCHEN.

05:01.999 --> 05:02.999
Lemonis: WHAT KITCHEN?

05:02.999 --> 05:04.999
Mike: IT'S A BROOM CLOSET

05:02.999 --> 05:04.999
WITH A REFRIGERATOR.

05:04.999 --> 05:06.999
Lemonis: YOU GUYS SAID YOU WERE

05:04.999 --> 05:06.999
TAKING ME INTO THE KITCHEN.

05:06.999 --> 05:07.999
-Mike: WE WERE BEING FACETIOUS.

05:06.999 --> 05:07.999
-Lemonis: OH.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.999
[ LAUGHTER ]

05:12.999 --> 05:13.999
A LOT OF FROZEN STUFF.

05:13.999 --> 05:16.999
THIS FOOD BARELY QUALIFIES

05:13.999 --> 05:16.999
AS GREEK.

05:16.999 --> 05:19.999
AND WORSE OFF, MOST OF IT'S

05:16.999 --> 05:19.999
NOT EVEN MADE FRESH.

05:19.999 --> 05:20.999
SPANAKOPITA'S FROZEN?

05:20.999 --> 05:22.999
-YOU BUY IT FROZEN?

05:20.999 --> 05:22.999
-Kathleen: YES.

05:22.999 --> 05:23.999
Lemonis: I'M GONNA TEACH YOU

05:22.999 --> 05:23.999
HOW TO MAKE SOME.

05:23.999 --> 05:25.999
I DON'T CARE

05:23.999 --> 05:25.999
HOW SMALL THE KITCHEN IS.

05:25.999 --> 05:27.999
YOU WANT TO HAVE

05:25.999 --> 05:27.999
A GOOD BUSINESS?

05:27.999 --> 05:29.999
DON'T SERVE FOOD

05:27.999 --> 05:29.999
OUT OF THE FREEZER.

05:29.999 --> 05:30.999
I DON'T KNOW ANY GREEKS,

05:30.999 --> 05:32.999
AT LEAST MY YIA-YIA AND MY AUNTS

05:30.999 --> 05:32.999
AND UNCLES --

05:33.000 --> 05:37.999
THEY'RE NOT GETTING SPANAKOPITA

05:33.000 --> 05:37.999
OUT OF THE FREEZER, RIGHT?

05:37.999 --> 05:40.999
FROZEN FOOD IS NEVER GONNA BE

05:37.999 --> 05:40.999
AS TASTY AS FRESH FOOD.

05:40.999 --> 05:42.999
AND, IN FACT,

05:40.999 --> 05:42.999
IT'S A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE.

05:42.999 --> 05:44.999
BUYING FROZEN FRIES

05:42.999 --> 05:44.999
FROM A DISTRIBUTOR

05:44.999 --> 05:48.999
COSTS MY BIG FAT GREEK GYRO

05:44.999 --> 05:48.999
48 CENTS PER SERVING.

05:48.999 --> 05:50.999
BUT IF THEY BUY RAW POTATOES

05:50.999 --> 05:52.999
AND PREPARE THE FRIES

05:50.999 --> 05:52.999
THEMSELVES,

05:52.999 --> 05:57.999
THAT COST DROPS NEARLY 71%

05:52.999 --> 05:57.999
TO 14 CENTS PER SERVING.

05:57.999 --> 06:00.999
IF THEY SELL 200 ORDERS OF FRIES

05:57.999 --> 06:00.999
EVERY DAY,

06:00.999 --> 06:04.999
THEY'VE JUST EARNED

06:00.999 --> 06:04.999
AN ADDITIONAL $68 FOR THAT DAY.

06:04.999 --> 06:08.999
AND OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR,

06:04.999 --> 06:08.999
THAT'S ALMOST $25,000.

06:08.999 --> 06:10.999
THAT'S MONEY IN THE BANK.

06:10.999 --> 06:12.999
FROZEN GRAPE LEAVES.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.999
Lemonis: THEY TASTE...

06:16.999 --> 06:18.999
THEY'RE ACTUALLY TERRIBLE.

06:18.999 --> 06:19.999
Andreas: YOU DON'T LIKE THEM?

06:19.999 --> 06:20.999
Lemonis: NO. DO YOU?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.999
Michael:

06:21.000 --> 06:22.999
I CAN'T EAT THEM LIKE THAT.

06:23.999 --> 06:25.999
Lemonis: FOR A RESTAURANT

06:23.999 --> 06:25.999
TO BE SUCCESSFUL,

06:25.999 --> 06:27.999
THEY NEED TO MANAGE

06:25.999 --> 06:27.999
THEIR FOOD COSTS.

06:27.999 --> 06:29.999
I'M WONDERING

06:27.999 --> 06:29.999
IF MIKE AND KATHLEEN KNOW

06:29.999 --> 06:31.999
HOW TO MAKE HEALTHY MARGINS

06:29.999 --> 06:31.999
FROM THEIR BIGGEST SELLER --

06:31.999 --> 06:32.999
THE GYRO SANDWICH.

06:32.999 --> 06:34.999
WHAT DOES THIS ACTUALLY COST?

06:34.999 --> 06:36.999
Mike: ABOUT 16 CENTS APIECE.

06:36.999 --> 06:37.999
Lemonis: HOW MUCH IS THE FOIL?

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
Mike: FOIL'S ABOUT

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
4 CENTS APIECE, SO WE HAVE...

06:39.999 --> 06:40.999
Lemonis:

06:39.999 --> 06:40.999
16 CENTS FOR THE BREAD,

06:40.999 --> 06:41.999
-4 CENTS FOR THE FOIL.

06:40.999 --> 06:41.999
-Mike: CORRECT.

06:41.999 --> 06:44.999
WE'RE PUTTING ABOUT $1.20 WORTH

06:41.999 --> 06:44.999
OF MEAT ON THERE.

06:44.999 --> 06:46.999
Lemonis:

06:44.999 --> 06:46.999
OKAY, HOW MUCH IS THAT SAUCE?

06:46.999 --> 06:47.999
Mike:

06:46.999 --> 06:47.999
IT'S ABOUT 22 CENTS TO MAKE.

06:47.999 --> 06:49.999
Lemonis:

06:47.999 --> 06:49.999
SO NOW I'M AT $1.52?

06:49.999 --> 06:51.999
-Mike: MM-HMM.

06:49.999 --> 06:51.999
-Lemonis: OKAY, WHAT'S NEXT?

06:51.999 --> 06:53.999
Mike: THEN WE'RE GONNA SPRINKLE

06:51.999 --> 06:53.999
A LITTLE BIT OF ONION.

06:53.999 --> 06:54.999
Lemonis: OKAY. WHAT ELSE?

06:54.999 --> 06:56.999
Mike: AND THEN LETTUCE,

06:54.999 --> 06:56.999
AND THEN TOMATO, AS WELL.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.999
Lemonis: WE'RE AT $1.52 NOW.

06:58.999 --> 07:00.999
HOW MUCH DOES THE LETTUCE,

06:58.999 --> 07:00.999
ONION, AND TOMATO COST?

07:00.999 --> 07:01.999
Mike:

07:00.999 --> 07:01.999
PROBABLY ABOUT 9 TO 10 CENTS.

07:01.999 --> 07:03.999
-Lemonis: SO WE'RE AT $1.62.

07:01.999 --> 07:03.999
-Mike: CORRECT.

07:03.999 --> 07:05.999
Lemonis:

07:03.999 --> 07:05.999
WHAT DO YOU SELL THIS FOR?

07:05.999 --> 07:06.999
Mike: WE SELL IT FOR $7.50.

07:06.999 --> 07:07.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

07:07.999 --> 07:09.999
IT APPEARS AS THOUGH IT COSTS

07:07.999 --> 07:09.999
ABOUT $1.62

07:09.999 --> 07:10.999
TO MAKE A GYRO SANDWICH.

07:10.999 --> 07:16.000
AND THEY SELL IT FOR $7.50,

07:10.999 --> 07:16.000
A 78% MARGIN.

07:16.999 --> 07:18.000
NOW, I KNOW THE OTHER PRODUCTS

07:16.999 --> 07:18.000
THAT ARE FROZEN

07:18.999 --> 07:19.999
AND SOURCED

07:18.999 --> 07:19.999
FROM OTHER MANUFACTURERS --

07:19.999 --> 07:21.999
THEY DON'T COME

07:19.999 --> 07:21.999
WITH THE SAME MARGINS,

07:21.999 --> 07:23.999
WHICH IS ALL THE MORE REASON

07:23.999 --> 07:25.999
TO ADD MORE FRESH, HOMEMADE,

07:23.999 --> 07:25.999
AUTHENTIC ITEMS.

07:30.999 --> 07:31.999
WHO CAME UP WITH THE NAME?

07:31.999 --> 07:32.999
-Kathleen: YOU DID.

07:31.999 --> 07:32.999
-Mike: YEAH, I DID.

07:32.999 --> 07:34.999
Kathleen: WE HAVE ISSUES

07:32.999 --> 07:34.999
WITH THE NAME, TOO.

07:34.999 --> 07:35.999
Lemonis: WHAT ARE THE ISSUES?

07:35.999 --> 07:37.999
Mike: WELL, THERE WAS A COMPANY

07:35.999 --> 07:37.999
IN CALIFORNIA

07:37.999 --> 07:42.999
THAT ACTUALLY TRADEMARKED

07:37.999 --> 07:42.999
"MY BIG FAT GREEK."

07:43.999 --> 07:45.999
Lemonis: YOU EVER HAD

07:43.999 --> 07:45.999
ANY DIALOGUE WITH THEM?

07:45.999 --> 07:46.999
Mike:

07:45.999 --> 07:46.999
ONE E-MAIL CONVERSATION.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.999
-Lemonis: NO PHONE CALL.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.999
-Mike: NO.

07:48.999 --> 07:49.999
IT WAS VERY SHORT

07:48.999 --> 07:49.999
AND VERY BRIEF.

07:49.999 --> 07:50.999
Lemonis: "GO POUND SAND.

07:49.999 --> 07:50.999
YOU GO POUND SAND."

07:50.999 --> 07:52.999
Mike: PRETTY MUCH.

07:52.999 --> 07:54.999
Lemonis: NORMALLY, WHEN THERE'S

07:52.999 --> 07:54.999
A TRADEMARK DISPUTE IN A NAME,

07:54.999 --> 07:55.999
IT'S SOMETHING

07:54.999 --> 07:55.999
YOU CAN WORK THROUGH,

07:55.999 --> 07:57.999
ESPECIALLY

07:55.999 --> 07:57.999
IF IT'S A SINGLE LOCATION.

07:57.999 --> 07:58.999
BUT IN THIS CASE,

07:58.999 --> 08:01.999
WE'VE SOLD THE RIGHTS

07:58.999 --> 08:01.999
TO THE NAME TO FRANCHISEES.

08:01.999 --> 08:03.999
NOW WE'RE FINDING OUT

08:01.999 --> 08:03.999
WE CAN'T ACTUALLY USE THE NAME.

08:03.999 --> 08:05.999
YOU GOT A PROBLEM.

08:05.999 --> 08:07.999
HOW MANY FRANCHISEES

08:05.999 --> 08:07.999
DO YOU HAVE?

08:07.999 --> 08:08.999
Mike: FIVE OTHER STORES.

08:08.999 --> 08:10.999
-Lemonis: INCLUDING THIS ONE?

08:08.999 --> 08:10.999
-Kathleen: YES.

08:10.999 --> 08:12.999
Lemonis:

08:10.999 --> 08:12.999
AND SO THE OTHER FOUR,

08:12.999 --> 08:15.999
IN ADDITION TO THIS ONE,

08:12.999 --> 08:15.999
HOW DO THEY DO?

08:15.999 --> 08:17.999
Mike:

08:15.999 --> 08:17.999
THEY DO -- THEY DO...OKAY.

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
Lemonis:

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
SO, WHO HAS THE BEST LOCATION?

08:19.999 --> 08:20.999
-Mike: THE MARKET SQUARE STORE.

08:19.999 --> 08:20.999
-Kathleen: MARKET SQUARE.

08:20.999 --> 08:21.999
-Lemonis: WHERE'S THAT?

08:20.999 --> 08:21.999
-Kathleen: DOWNTOWN.

08:21.999 --> 08:23.999
Lemonis: DOWNTOWN.

08:21.999 --> 08:23.999
WHO HAS THE WORST LOCATION?

08:23.999 --> 08:25.999
Kathleen: RIGHT NOW?

08:25.999 --> 08:26.999
-Mike: PROBABLY MT. LEBANON.

08:25.999 --> 08:26.999
-Kathleen: MT. LEBANON.

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
Lemonis: HOW OFTEN

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
DO YOU SEE THEM IN PERSON?

08:28.999 --> 08:32.999
Mike: A COUPLE TIMES A MONTH,

08:28.999 --> 08:32.999
WE TRY TO, AT MINIMUM.

08:32.999 --> 08:33.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
SO, HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO DO.

08:35.999 --> 08:37.999
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA SPEND

08:35.999 --> 08:37.999
SOME TIME JUST WITH THEM.

08:37.999 --> 08:40.999
SINCE ANDREAS AND MICHAEL

08:37.999 --> 08:40.999
ARE NOW FRANCHISEES,

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
I WANT TO GET A FEEL

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
FOR THEIR RELATIONSHIP

08:42.999 --> 08:43.999
WITH BOTH THEIR MOM AND MIKE

08:43.999 --> 08:45.999
AND FIND OUT

08:43.999 --> 08:45.999
IF THEY'RE GETTING THE SUPPORT

08:45.999 --> 08:46.999
THAT THEY REALLY NEED.

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
Andreas:

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
SO FAR, MARCUS, I CAN SHOW YOU.

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
Lemonis:

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
HOW YOU DOING? WELCOME.

08:50.999 --> 08:51.999
-Andreas: COME ON IN.

08:50.999 --> 08:51.999
-Lemonis: TI KANIS.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.999
SO, THAT'S ONE THING

08:51.999 --> 08:53.999
THAT I WOULD DO --

08:53.999 --> 08:56.999
INSTEAD OF SAYING "HELLO,"

08:53.999 --> 08:56.999
I WOULD JUST CHANGE IT.

08:56.999 --> 08:57.999
MAKE IT STRAIGHT-UP,

08:56.999 --> 08:57.999
LIKE, GREEK.

08:57.999 --> 09:00.999
Michael:

08:57.999 --> 09:00.999
AT ONE POINT, WE STARTED

08:57.999 --> 09:00.999
PLAYING GREEK MUSIC HERE,

09:00.999 --> 09:02.999
AND MIKE DIDN'T LIKE IT.

09:02.999 --> 09:04.999
Lemonis: WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

09:02.999 --> 09:04.999
"MIKE DIDN'T LIKE IT"?

09:04.999 --> 09:06.999
Michael:

09:04.999 --> 09:06.999
HE'S VERY STUBBORN, VERY...

09:06.999 --> 09:08.999
Lemonis:

09:06.999 --> 09:08.999
IT'S A GREEK RESTAURANT.

09:08.999 --> 09:09.999
Andreas: MY BROTHER AND I

09:08.999 --> 09:09.999
WOULD LIKE TO, LIKE,

09:09.999 --> 09:12.999
POP IN EACH STORE

09:09.999 --> 09:12.999
ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS

09:12.999 --> 09:16.999
AND LET ME TASTE THE SAUCE

09:12.999 --> 09:16.999
CONSISTENCY, EVERYTHING.

09:16.999 --> 09:20.999
Lemonis:

09:16.999 --> 09:20.999
WHAT IS ONE THING THAT'S BROKEN

09:16.999 --> 09:20.999
IN THIS OVERALL CONCEPT?

09:20.999 --> 09:22.999
Andreas: ONE THING THAT'S BROKEN

09:20.999 --> 09:22.999
IS CONFORMITY.

09:22.999 --> 09:25.999
MIKE -- HE'S NOT INVOLVED.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
Lemonis: HOW IS THE RELATIONSHIP

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
BETWEEN HIM AND YOUR MOM?

09:27.999 --> 09:29.999
IT SEEMS A LITTLE STRAINED

09:27.999 --> 09:29.999
RIGHT NOW.

09:29.999 --> 09:30.999
Michael: IT'S THE WAY

09:29.999 --> 09:30.999
THAT HE TALKS TO YOU.

09:30.999 --> 09:32.999
IT DRIVES HER CRAZY.

09:32.999 --> 09:34.999
IT DRIVES THE OTHER

09:32.999 --> 09:34.999
FRANCHISE STORES CRAZY.

09:34.999 --> 09:35.999
Lemonis:

09:34.999 --> 09:35.999
WHOEVER HE'S TALKING TO.

09:35.999 --> 09:36.999
Michael: ANYBODY.

09:36.999 --> 09:37.999
Lemonis:

09:36.999 --> 09:37.999
I KEEP HEARING FROM EVERYBODY

09:37.999 --> 09:39.999
HOW MIKE TALKS TO PEOPLE,

09:37.999 --> 09:39.999
BUT I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

09:39.999 --> 09:40.999
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT.

09:40.999 --> 09:43.999
MAYBE HE'S ON

09:40.999 --> 09:43.999
HIS BEST BEHAVIOR FOR ME.

09:43.999 --> 09:44.999
THAT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME.

09:44.999 --> 09:46.999
GROWING UP, DID YOU --

09:44.999 --> 09:46.999
DID, YOU KNOW,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.999
MIKE AND YOUR MOM --

09:47.000 --> 09:49.999
DONE A GOOD JOB RAISING YOU?

09:49.999 --> 09:51.999
Michael: WELL, WHEN YOU SAID,

09:49.999 --> 09:51.999
"GROWING UP,"

09:51.999 --> 09:52.999
IT WASN'T GROWING UP.

09:52.999 --> 09:55.999
I WAS 15, HE WAS 13

09:55.999 --> 09:57.999
WHEN OUR FATHER PASSED.

09:57.999 --> 09:59.999
Lemonis: OH, MY GOSH.

09:59.999 --> 10:00.999
-YOUR FATHER DIED.

09:59.999 --> 10:00.999
-Michael: YEAH.

10:00.999 --> 10:02.999
Lemonis: HOW DID HE DIE?

10:02.999 --> 10:06.999
Michael: MY MOM AND HIM

10:02.999 --> 10:06.999
WERE GOING ON A TRIP TO VEGAS.

10:06.999 --> 10:08.999
THEY WERE RAN OFF THE ROAD

10:06.999 --> 10:08.999
BY A SEMITRUCK.

10:10.999 --> 10:11.999
Lemonis:

10:10.999 --> 10:11.999
YOUR MOM WAS IN THE CAR.

10:11.999 --> 10:13.999
Michael:

10:11.999 --> 10:13.999
MY MOTHER SURVIVED BECAUSE

10:11.999 --> 10:13.999
SHE HAD HER SEAT BELT ON.

10:13.999 --> 10:15.999
REALLY THINK

10:13.999 --> 10:15.999
IT CHANGED HER LIFE.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
Lemonis: DO YOU THINK

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
YOUR MOM'S RECOVERED

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
FROM THAT ACCIDENT

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
MENTALLY, EMOTIONALLY?

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
Michael: I THINK SHE FEELS

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
BLESSED TO JUST BE HERE.

10:21.999 --> 10:23.999
Andreas: SHE LIVES FOR US.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.999
SHE -- IT'S ALL ABOUT US.

10:25.999 --> 10:28.999
Lemonis: THIS FAMILY SUFFERED

10:25.999 --> 10:28.999
A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY,

10:28.999 --> 10:31.999
AND IT'S LEFT THEM ALL IN,

10:28.999 --> 10:31.999
I WOULD SAY, A VERY TOUGH PLACE.

10:31.999 --> 10:32.999
THIS BUSINESS

10:31.999 --> 10:32.999
IS IMPORTANT TO THEM

10:32.999 --> 10:34.999
NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE WAY

10:32.999 --> 10:34.999
THEY MAKE THEIR LIVING

10:34.999 --> 10:36.999
AND IT'S A WAY

10:34.999 --> 10:36.999
THAT THEY PAY THEIR BILLS,

10:36.999 --> 10:38.999
BUT IT'S A WAY

10:36.999 --> 10:38.999
THEY KEEP THEIR FAMILY TOGETHER.

10:38.999 --> 10:40.999
IT'S A WAY THAT

10:38.999 --> 10:40.999
THEY SPEND TIME TOGETHER.

10:40.999 --> 10:43.999
AND I THINK KATHLEEN NEEDS IT,

10:40.999 --> 10:43.999
AND SO DO THE BOYS.

10:43.999 --> 10:45.999
HOW DID YOU GET PAST

10:43.999 --> 10:45.999
THE ACCIDENT?

10:45.999 --> 10:48.999
Kathleen: MY KIDS.

10:49.999 --> 10:52.999
IT'S HUGE FOR ME AND MY KIDS.

10:52.999 --> 10:55.999
I NEVER GOT TO MOURN

10:52.999 --> 10:55.999
ANY OF THAT.

10:55.999 --> 10:58.999
I HOLD A LOT IN.

10:58.999 --> 11:01.999
Lemonis: YOU WERE IN THE CAR.

11:01.999 --> 11:04.999
Kathleen: YES.

11:04.999 --> 11:07.999
IT'S HARD.

11:07.999 --> 11:09.999
BUT THEY -- THESE KIDS

11:07.999 --> 11:09.999
ARE WHAT KEEP ME GROUNDED.

11:09.999 --> 11:11.999
THEY KEEP ME WHOLE.

11:11.999 --> 11:12.999
AND MIKE KNOWS THAT, AS WELL.

11:12.999 --> 11:14.999
Lemonis: HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

11:14.999 --> 11:16.999
Kathleen: I'M VERY FRUSTRATED.

11:16.999 --> 11:20.999
I JUST FEEL LIKE I BUILT

11:16.999 --> 11:20.999
SOMETHING SO GREAT HERE,

11:20.999 --> 11:22.999
AND TO PUT IT OUT THERE

11:22.999 --> 11:25.999
AND NOT SEE IT DO AS WELL

11:22.999 --> 11:25.999
AS I WANT IT TO DO,

11:25.999 --> 11:27.999
IT'S FRUSTRATING.

11:27.999 --> 11:29.999
Lemonis: YOU MEAN

11:27.999 --> 11:29.999
WITH THE OTHER LOCATIONS?

11:29.999 --> 11:31.999
Kathleen:

11:29.999 --> 11:31.999
IT'S OUR BIGGEST ARGUMENT.

11:31.999 --> 11:33.999
WE FIGHT ALL THE TIME

11:31.999 --> 11:33.999
ABOUT THE OTHER FRANCHISES.

11:33.999 --> 11:36.999
THAT WAS, LIKE,

11:33.999 --> 11:36.999
A MESS FROM THE BEGINNING.

11:36.999 --> 11:40.999
I THINK IT WAS VERY MISMANAGED,

11:36.999 --> 11:40.999
AND THAT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY.

11:40.999 --> 11:42.999
'CAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT

11:40.999 --> 11:42.999
FOR MIKE.

11:42.999 --> 11:44.999
I JUST WANT THINGS TO BE

11:42.999 --> 11:44.999
THE RIGHT WAY.

11:44.999 --> 11:46.999
I DON'T FEEL LIKE

11:44.999 --> 11:46.999
I'M BEING HEARD.

11:46.999 --> 11:49.999
I JUST FEEL LIKE

11:46.999 --> 11:49.999
I'M BEING HELD BACK.

11:49.999 --> 11:50.999
Lemonis:

11:49.999 --> 11:50.999
WHAT'S BECOMING CLEAR TO ME

11:50.999 --> 11:53.999
IS THAT THE FRANCHISEE MODEL

11:50.999 --> 11:53.999
THAT MIKE SET UP

11:53.999 --> 11:54.999
SEEMS TO BE

11:53.999 --> 11:54.999
PRETTY DYSFUNCTIONAL.

11:54.999 --> 11:57.999
I NEED TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS

11:54.999 --> 11:57.999
TO SEE THE BIG PICTURE.

11:57.999 --> 12:00.999
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS

12:00.999 --> 12:02.999
WHAT DOES THE PARENT COMPANY

12:00.999 --> 12:02.999
LOOK LIKE?

12:02.999 --> 12:05.999
AND THEN WHAT DO

12:02.999 --> 12:05.999
ALL THE INDIVIDUAL FRANCHISES

12:05.999 --> 12:06.999
UNDERNEATH HIM LOOK LIKE?

12:06.999 --> 12:08.999
AND SO WHERE'S

12:06.999 --> 12:08.999
THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIALS?

12:08.999 --> 12:13.999
Mike: THAT WOULD BE

12:08.999 --> 12:13.999
JUST OUR PERSONAL RETURNS.

12:13.999 --> 12:16.999
WE WERE ACTING AS A FRANCHISOR

12:13.999 --> 12:16.999
THROUGH OUR PERSONAL INCOME.

12:16.999 --> 12:19.999
Lemonis: RIGHT,

12:16.999 --> 12:19.999
BUT WHAT IS THE LEGAL ENTITY?

12:19.999 --> 12:21.000
WHERE IS THE PARENT COMPANY?

12:21.999 --> 12:25.000
Mike: WE JUST SET UP

12:21.999 --> 12:25.000
THE MY BIG FAT GREEK GYRO LLC

12:25.999 --> 12:28.999
AS THE FRANCHISE,

12:25.999 --> 12:28.999
OR MODEL FOR THE FRANCHISEES.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.999
Kathleen: BUT WE JUST DID THAT.

12:30.999 --> 12:33.999
Lemonis: AND SO THIS IS

12:30.999 --> 12:33.999
KIND OF A NEW BUSINESS.

12:35.999 --> 12:37.000
WHO DOES THESE FINANCIALS?

12:37.999 --> 12:38.999
Mike: WE HAVE AN ACCOUNTANT.

12:38.999 --> 12:39.999
Lemonis:

12:38.999 --> 12:39.999
OKAY, THE MOST RECENT YEAR,

12:39.999 --> 12:43.999
THIS LOCATION

12:39.999 --> 12:43.999
DID $300,000 IN SALES

12:43.999 --> 12:45.999
-AND MADE $100,000.

12:43.999 --> 12:45.999
-Mike: CORRECT.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.999
Lemonis:

12:45.999 --> 12:47.999
GREAT RETURN ON CAPITAL.

12:47.999 --> 12:49.999
HOW MUCH DEBT

12:47.999 --> 12:49.999
DOES THE BUSINESS HAVE TODAY?

12:49.999 --> 12:50.999
-Kathleen: NO DEBT.

12:49.999 --> 12:50.999
-Lemonis: NO DEBT.

12:50.999 --> 12:52.999
AND DOES THE BUSINESS

12:50.999 --> 12:52.999
HAVE A LOT OF CASH TODAY?

12:52.999 --> 12:54.000
Mike: ON HAND? NO.

12:54.999 --> 12:56.999
Lemonis: EVEN THOUGH

12:54.999 --> 12:56.999
THIS PLACE IS MISMANAGED

12:56.999 --> 12:58.999
AND THE MENU

12:56.999 --> 12:58.999
IS LARGELY UNINSPIRED,

12:58.999 --> 13:02.999
IT STILL MAKES $100,000

12:58.999 --> 13:02.999
ON $300,000 IN SALES.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.999
AND WHILE

13:02.999 --> 13:04.999
I'M IMPRESSED WITH THAT,

13:04.999 --> 13:06.999
I'M FRUSTRATED WITH THE FACT

13:04.999 --> 13:06.999
THAT THE FRANCHISEES

13:06.999 --> 13:09.999
AREN'T GETTING THE GUIDANCE

13:06.999 --> 13:09.999
THAT THEY DESERVE.

13:09.999 --> 13:11.999
SO I WANT TO GO MEET

13:09.999 --> 13:11.999
SOME OF THE FRANCHISEES

13:11.999 --> 13:13.000
AND GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

13:13.999 --> 13:15.999
OF HOW THIS OPERATION

13:13.999 --> 13:15.999
ACTUALLY FUNCTIONS.

13:21.999 --> 13:22.999
-HOW YOU DOING?

13:21.999 --> 13:22.999
-Jace: GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

13:22.999 --> 13:24.999
-Lemonis: I'M MARCUS.

13:22.999 --> 13:24.999
-Jace: JACE.

13:24.999 --> 13:26.999
Lemonis: ACCORDING TO MIKE,

13:24.999 --> 13:26.999
THE MT. LEBANON FRANCHISE

13:26.999 --> 13:29.999
IS THE ONE THAT'S STRUGGLING

13:26.999 --> 13:29.999
THE MOST, AND I CAN SEE WHY.

13:29.999 --> 13:32.999
IT'S DARK. IT'S DIRTY.

13:29.999 --> 13:32.999
THE MENU'S CONFUSING.

13:32.999 --> 13:33.999
DO THEY SERVE

13:32.999 --> 13:33.999
HAMBURGERS AND HOT DOGS,

13:33.999 --> 13:35.999
OR DO THEY SERVE GYROS?

13:35.999 --> 13:37.999
YOU WONDER

13:35.999 --> 13:37.999
WHY PEOPLE AREN'T COMING HERE?

13:37.999 --> 13:38.999
YOU'RE NOT GIVING THEM

13:37.999 --> 13:38.999
A REASON TO COME.

13:38.999 --> 13:40.999
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

13:40.999 --> 13:41.999
Jace:

13:40.999 --> 13:41.999
A LITTLE OVER THREE YEARS.

13:41.999 --> 13:43.999
Lemonis:

13:41.999 --> 13:43.999
HOW MUCH DO YOU INTERACT

13:43.999 --> 13:44.999
WITH YOUR FRANCHISORS?

13:44.999 --> 13:46.999
HOW MUCH DO YOU INTERACT

13:44.999 --> 13:46.999
WITH THEM?

13:46.999 --> 13:48.999
Jace: UH, NOT TOO MUCH.

13:48.999 --> 13:51.999
THEY COME IN THE FIRST

13:48.999 --> 13:51.999
OF THE MONTH TO GET THEIR CHECK,

13:51.999 --> 13:53.999
AND THEN I DON'T SEE THEM

13:51.999 --> 13:53.999
TOO MUCH AFTER THAT.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.999
Lemonis:

13:53.999 --> 13:55.999
THEY DON'T COME IN AND HELP

13:55.999 --> 13:59.999
AND TALK ABOUT IDEAS

13:55.999 --> 13:59.999
AND HELP MARKET THE PLACE?

13:59.999 --> 14:00.999
Jace: NOT REALLY, NO.

14:00.999 --> 14:03.999
LIKE, I DON'T SEE THEM

14:00.999 --> 14:03.999
UNLESS IT'S THE FIRST.

14:03.999 --> 14:04.999
Lemonis: MAKE GOOD MONEY?

14:04.999 --> 14:06.999
Jace: NO.

14:06.999 --> 14:07.999
NOT THE MONEY

14:06.999 --> 14:07.999
WE WANT TO BE MAKING.

14:07.999 --> 14:09.999
Lemonis: SO, HOW DO YOU

14:07.999 --> 14:09.999
KEEP THE DOORS OPEN?

14:09.999 --> 14:12.999
Jace: WE'RE JUST --

14:09.999 --> 14:12.999
SKIN OF OUR TEETH RIGHT NOW.

14:14.999 --> 14:16.999
Lemonis: ALL RIGHT, MY MAN.

14:14.999 --> 14:16.999
NICE MEETING YOU.

14:16.999 --> 14:17.999
Jace: IT WAS VERY NICE

14:16.999 --> 14:17.999
MEETING YOU, TOO.

14:17.999 --> 14:19.000
Lemonis: TAKE CARE.

14:19.999 --> 14:20.999
I'M ON MY WAY

14:19.999 --> 14:20.999
TO THE MARKET SQUARE LOCATION.

14:20.999 --> 14:23.999
IT'S IN THE HEART OF DOWNTOWN

14:20.999 --> 14:23.999
AND GETS A TON OF TRAFFIC.

14:23.999 --> 14:24.999
HOW ARE YOU?

14:24.999 --> 14:25.999
-Sasha: HI.

14:24.999 --> 14:25.999
-Lemonis: I'M MARCUS.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.999
Sasha: I'M SASHA.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.999
NICE TO MEET YOU.

14:27.999 --> 14:28.999
-Lemonis: NICE TO MEET YOU.

14:27.999 --> 14:28.999
-Rich: HI, MARCUS.

14:28.999 --> 14:30.999
-I'M RICHARD. HOW ARE YOU?

14:28.999 --> 14:30.999
-Lemonis: NICE TO MEET YOU.

14:30.999 --> 14:32.999
MARKET SQUARE SERVES GYROS,

14:30.999 --> 14:32.999
BUT BEYOND THAT,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.999
THERE ARE FEW SIMILARITIES

14:33.000 --> 14:35.999
TO THE OTHER LOCATIONS.

14:35.999 --> 14:37.999
THE COLOR SCHEME AND SEATING

14:35.999 --> 14:37.999
ARE DIFFERENT.

14:37.999 --> 14:38.999
EVEN THE LAYOUT'S DIFFERENT.

14:38.999 --> 14:40.999
SAME BRAND,

14:38.999 --> 14:40.999
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE.

14:40.999 --> 14:42.999
NOT A GOOD IDEA.

14:42.999 --> 14:44.999
HOW'S BUSINESS?

14:42.999 --> 14:44.999
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT.

14:44.999 --> 14:46.999
Rich: WELL, AS FAR

14:44.999 --> 14:46.999
AS BUSINESS IS CONCERNED,

14:46.999 --> 14:47.999
WE DO ABOUT A HALF A MILLION

14:46.999 --> 14:47.999
A YEAR.

14:47.999 --> 14:48.999
Lemonis: HALF A MILLION

14:47.999 --> 14:48.999
IN SALES?

14:48.999 --> 14:50.999
Rich: WELL, TO BREAK EVEN.

14:51.999 --> 14:53.999
Lemonis: SO, HOW OFTEN

14:51.999 --> 14:53.999
DO YOU SEE MIKE AND KATHLEEN?

14:53.999 --> 14:55.999
Sasha: THE FIRST OF THE MONTH,

14:53.999 --> 14:55.999
LIKE CLOCKWORK.

14:55.999 --> 14:57.999
Rich: THEY'RE HERE

14:55.999 --> 14:57.999
TO GET THEIR ROYALTY CHECK.

14:57.999 --> 14:59.999
Lemonis: DO THEY STAY FOR A DAY

14:59.999 --> 15:00.999
AND WORK ON YOUR BUSINESS

14:59.999 --> 15:00.999
AND HELP YOU?

15:00.999 --> 15:01.999
Rich: NO.

15:01.999 --> 15:05.000
WE PUT $175,000

15:01.999 --> 15:05.000
OF OUR OWN MONEY INTO IT.

15:05.999 --> 15:07.999
WE JUST GUTTED

15:05.999 --> 15:07.999
THIS ENTIRE BUILDING.

15:07.999 --> 15:09.999
Lemonis: SO, YOU PUT IN

15:07.999 --> 15:09.999
ALL THIS EQUIPMENT,

15:09.999 --> 15:11.999
THE FLOORS, THE CEILINGS,

15:09.999 --> 15:11.999
THE WHOLE THING.

15:11.999 --> 15:12.999
Sasha: EVERYTHING.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.999
Lemonis: $175,000'S

15:12.999 --> 15:14.999
A LOT OF MONEY TO INVEST

15:14.999 --> 15:16.000
WITHOUT GETTING SUPPORT.

15:16.999 --> 15:17.999
Sasha: YEAH.

15:17.999 --> 15:19.999
Lemonis: AFTER VISITING

15:17.999 --> 15:19.999
A NUMBER OF THE LOCATIONS,

15:19.999 --> 15:21.999
IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME

15:19.999 --> 15:21.999
THAT THERE'S NO SYSTEM,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.999
THERE'S NO PROCESS,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.999
AND THERE'S NO CONSISTENCY.

15:24.999 --> 15:27.999
IT'S A BIGGER PROBLEM

15:24.999 --> 15:27.999
THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE.

15:30.999 --> 15:32.999
YOU KNOW,

15:30.999 --> 15:32.999
IT'S A LOT TO TAKE IN HERE.

15:32.999 --> 15:33.999
I'M A LITTLE DISILLUSIONED

15:33.999 --> 15:37.999
BY WHAT I THOUGHT

15:33.999 --> 15:37.999
I WAS COMING TO INVEST IN.

15:37.999 --> 15:41.999
I THOUGHT THERE WAS A TRUE

15:37.999 --> 15:41.999
FRANCHISOR/FRANCHISEE MODEL

15:41.999 --> 15:43.999
WITH A PARENT COMPANY ON TOP

15:43.999 --> 15:47.999
THAT HAD FRANCHISEES UNDERNEATH

15:43.999 --> 15:47.999
THEM THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL,

15:47.999 --> 15:51.999
AND THAT I EXPECTED TO FIND

15:47.999 --> 15:51.999
A LOT MORE AUTHENTICITY.

15:51.999 --> 15:56.999
AND, REALLY, WHAT I FEEL LIKE

15:51.999 --> 15:56.999
I'VE COME TO IS A NICE CONCEPT

15:56.999 --> 16:01.999
THAT FEELS A LOT MORE

15:56.999 --> 16:01.999
LIKE A STARTUP TO A FRANCHISE

16:01.999 --> 16:05.999
THAN IT REALLY IS

16:01.999 --> 16:05.999
A WELL-OILED FRANCHISE MACHINE.

16:05.999 --> 16:06.999
THIS IS A STARTUP.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.999
Mike:

16:06.999 --> 16:08.999
FOR THE MARKET SQUARE STORE,

16:08.999 --> 16:12.999
I PERSONALLY SHOPPED

16:08.999 --> 16:12.999
FOR THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION.

16:12.999 --> 16:14.999
THERE HAS BEEN SWEAT EQUITY

16:12.999 --> 16:14.999
THAT WE INVESTED

16:14.999 --> 16:15.999
IN THESE PARTICULAR STORES.

16:15.999 --> 16:16.999
Lemonis:

16:15.999 --> 16:16.999
YOU DIDN'T INVEST ANY SWEAT

16:16.999 --> 16:17.999
INTO THOSE OTHER LOCATIONS.

16:17.999 --> 16:19.999
YOU GUYS DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

16:19.999 --> 16:21.999
Mike:

16:19.999 --> 16:21.999
THE VOLUME OF WORK THAT YOU --

16:21.999 --> 16:22.999
Lemonis: HAVE TO DO?

16:22.999 --> 16:23.999
Mike: TODAY IS GONNA BE

16:22.999 --> 16:23.999
A FRACTION OF WHAT,

16:23.999 --> 16:24.999
IN REALITY, YOU DO.

16:24.999 --> 16:26.999
-Lemonis: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

16:24.999 --> 16:26.999
-Mike: NO, I'M NOT.

16:26.999 --> 16:27.999
Lemonis:

16:26.999 --> 16:27.999
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE NAME,

16:27.999 --> 16:29.999
RE-MARKET IT,

16:27.999 --> 16:29.999
REBUILD THE STORES,

16:29.999 --> 16:31.999
COME UP WITH A NEW CONCEPT,

16:31.999 --> 16:32.999
FIGURE OUT HOW TO COMMUNICATE

16:31.999 --> 16:32.999
WITH THESE GUYS,

16:32.999 --> 16:34.999
PUT IN A SYSTEM.

16:34.999 --> 16:36.999
Mike: THESE ARE

16:34.999 --> 16:36.999
ALL VERY DOABLE THINGS.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.999
Lemonis: WELL, YOU JUST NOW

16:37.000 --> 16:40.999
DECIDED TO STOP PROCRASTINATING?

16:40.999 --> 16:42.999
Mike:

16:40.999 --> 16:42.999
THAT'S NOT A BAD THING, IS IT?

16:45.999 --> 16:47.999
Lemonis:

16:45.999 --> 16:47.999
I'M STRUGGLING WITH WHAT IT IS

16:47.999 --> 16:49.999
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE ME

16:47.999 --> 16:49.999
TO INVEST IN.

16:49.999 --> 16:52.999
THIS BUSINESS NEEDS STRUCTURE,

16:49.999 --> 16:52.999
DISCIPLINE,

16:52.999 --> 16:54.999
AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY,

16:52.999 --> 16:54.999
LEADERSHIP.

16:54.999 --> 16:56.999
THOSE OTHER FRANCHISES --

16:56.999 --> 16:58.999
THEY GAVE YOU A CHECK

16:56.999 --> 16:58.999
FOR $10,000.

16:58.999 --> 17:00.999
THEY PAY YOU ON A MONTHLY BASIS.

17:00.999 --> 17:03.999
WHAT ARE YOU GIVING THEM

17:00.999 --> 17:03.999
IN RETURN?

17:03.999 --> 17:04.999
Kathleen:

17:03.999 --> 17:04.999
WHAT ARE WE GIVING THEM?

17:04.999 --> 17:05.999
Mike:

17:04.999 --> 17:05.999
NOT AS MUCH AS THEY DESERVE.

17:05.999 --> 17:06.999
Lemonis: NOTHING.

17:07.999 --> 17:09.999
-YOU DON'T GO VISIT THEM.

17:07.999 --> 17:09.999
-Mike: NO, WE DO.

17:09.999 --> 17:11.999
Lemonis: YOU DON'T PROVIDE

17:09.999 --> 17:11.999
THE LEADERSHIP THAT THEY NEED.

17:11.999 --> 17:12.999
YOU DO NOT PROVIDE

17:11.999 --> 17:12.999
THE STRUCTURE.

17:12.999 --> 17:15.999
Kathleen: WE VISIT THEM,

17:12.999 --> 17:15.999
BUT WE DON'T -- HE'S RIGHT.

17:15.999 --> 17:16.999
-WE DON'T.

17:15.999 --> 17:16.999
-Mike: NO, WE DON'T.

17:16.999 --> 17:17.999
WE NEED TO.

17:17.999 --> 17:18.999
Lemonis:

17:17.999 --> 17:18.999
WHAT WERE YOU GONNA SAY?

17:18.999 --> 17:20.999
Kathleen: I WOULD LIKE

17:18.999 --> 17:20.999
TO STAY THERE FOR HOURS

17:20.999 --> 17:22.999
AND JUST TELL THEM

17:20.999 --> 17:22.999
WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND NOT DOING

17:22.999 --> 17:23.999
AND HOW TO DO THIS

17:23.999 --> 17:24.999
AND HOW TO DO THAT,

17:23.999 --> 17:24.999
TASTE THEIR SAUCE.

17:24.999 --> 17:26.999
Lemonis: DO YOU FEEL LIKE

17:24.999 --> 17:26.999
YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT?

17:26.999 --> 17:27.999
Kathleen:

17:26.999 --> 17:27.999
I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.

17:27.999 --> 17:29.999
Lemonis: DO YOU FEEL LIKE

17:27.999 --> 17:29.999
YOU KNOW MORE THAN MIKE

17:29.999 --> 17:30.999
ON HOW TO DO IT OPERATIONALLY?

17:30.999 --> 17:32.999
Kathleen:

17:30.999 --> 17:32.999
HE'LL SAY THAT HE KNOWS MORE,

17:32.999 --> 17:33.999
-BUT I THINK I KNOW MORE.

17:32.999 --> 17:33.999
-Lemonis: I'M ASKING YOU.

17:33.999 --> 17:35.999
-Kathleen: YES, I DO.

17:33.999 --> 17:35.999
-Lemonis: OKAY.

17:35.999 --> 17:37.999
WHY SHOULD I INVEST

17:35.999 --> 17:37.999
WITH YOU GUYS?

17:38.999 --> 17:40.999
Kathleen: I THINK WE HAVE

17:38.999 --> 17:40.999
A GREAT CONCEPT.

17:40.999 --> 17:42.999
Lemonis:

17:40.999 --> 17:42.999
A NEW NAME HAS TO BE CREATED.

17:42.999 --> 17:44.999
A NEW CONCEPT HAS TO BE CREATED.

17:44.999 --> 17:47.999
A NEW MENU HAS TO BE CREATED.

17:47.999 --> 17:52.999
I HAVE SERIOUS DOUBTS

17:47.999 --> 17:52.999
ABOUT WHO I'M GONNA PARTNER WITH

17:52.999 --> 17:54.999
AND HOW MUCH OF THE LIFTING

17:52.999 --> 17:54.999
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO.

17:54.999 --> 17:56.999
IT SCARES ME.

18:05.999 --> 18:06.999
ABOUT WHO I'M GONNA PARTNER WITH

18:10.999 --> 18:12.999
AND HOW MUCH OF THE LIFTING

18:10.999 --> 18:12.999
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO.

18:12.999 --> 18:14.999
IT SCARES ME.

18:14.999 --> 18:17.999
Kathleen: I COULD BE A LEADER,

18:14.999 --> 18:17.999
BUT I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU.

18:17.999 --> 18:19.999
I FEEL LIKE

18:17.999 --> 18:19.999
YOU HOLD ME BACK SOMETIMES.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.999
Lemonis: HOW?

18:21.999 --> 18:23.999
Kathleen: I WOULD LOVE TO GO

18:21.999 --> 18:23.999
AND IMPLEMENT THE THINGS

18:23.999 --> 18:25.999
THAT I TELL YOU TO DO,

18:25.999 --> 18:28.999
BUT YOU PUT ME IN A SITUATION

18:25.999 --> 18:28.999
LIKE IT'S SOMETHING

18:28.999 --> 18:30.999
THAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING

18:28.999 --> 18:30.999
AND I SHOULDN'T.

18:30.999 --> 18:31.999
...FIGHTING AND ARGUING.

18:31.999 --> 18:33.999
Mike: MY INTENT IS NEVER

18:31.999 --> 18:33.999
TO MAKE YOU FEEL THAT WAY,

18:33.999 --> 18:35.999
AND IF I DO,

18:33.999 --> 18:35.999
THEN I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT

18:35.999 --> 18:37.999
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT MY INTENT.

18:37.999 --> 18:41.999
Lemonis: I THINK THE IDEA

18:37.999 --> 18:41.999
OF THE BUSINESS IS VERY SMART.

18:41.999 --> 18:44.999
I THINK THE EXECUTION IS AWFUL.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.999
WHAT BOTHERS ME

18:44.999 --> 18:47.999
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE

18:47.999 --> 18:49.999
IS THAT WE TOOK MONEY

18:47.999 --> 18:49.999
FROM FRANCHISEES,

18:49.999 --> 18:52.999
AND WE DIDN'T DELIVER ON WHAT

18:49.999 --> 18:52.999
WE SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.999
Mike: WHAT WE SOLD THEM

18:54.999 --> 18:57.999
IS SOMETHING THAT WE

18:54.999 --> 18:57.999
FIRMLY, FIRMLY BELIEVE IN.

18:57.999 --> 18:58.999
Lemonis: YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT

18:58.999 --> 18:59.999
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T EXECUTE IT

18:58.999 --> 18:59.999
HERE.

18:59.999 --> 19:01.999
YOU CAN'T TELL SOMEBODY ELSE

19:01.999 --> 19:03.999
HOW TO RUN THEIR HOUSE

19:01.999 --> 19:03.999
WHEN YOU CAN'T RUN

19:03.999 --> 19:05.999
-YOUR OWN HOUSE RIGHT.

19:03.999 --> 19:05.999
-Kathleen: RIGHT.

19:05.999 --> 19:07.999
Lemonis: LET ME TELL YOU

19:05.999 --> 19:07.999
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE BUSINESS.

19:07.999 --> 19:10.999
WHEN I LOOK AT THE FINANCIALS

19:07.999 --> 19:10.999
OF THIS LOCATION

19:10.999 --> 19:15.999
AND IT DOES $300,000 IN SALES

19:10.999 --> 19:15.999
AND MAKES $100,000,

19:15.999 --> 19:16.999
IT'S PHENOMENAL.

19:16.999 --> 19:20.999
AND SO YOU'VE PROVED TO ME

19:16.999 --> 19:20.999
THAT THE CONCEPT CAN WORK.

19:20.999 --> 19:22.999
THAT'S WHAT HAS KEPT ME

19:20.999 --> 19:22.999
SITTING HERE.

19:22.999 --> 19:28.999
AND SO MY OFFER IS $350,000.

19:28.999 --> 19:32.999
BUT FOR MY $350,000,

19:28.999 --> 19:32.999
I WANT 55% OF THE BUSINESS.

19:32.999 --> 19:33.999
FULL CONTROL.

19:33.999 --> 19:35.999
I'M INVESTING

19:33.999 --> 19:35.999
IN THE PARENT COMPANY.

19:35.999 --> 19:37.999
YOU ARE A PARTNER

19:35.999 --> 19:37.999
OF THE PARENT COMPANY.

19:37.999 --> 19:42.999
YOU WILL MAINTAIN 100% OWNERSHIP

19:37.999 --> 19:42.999
OF THIS FRANCHISE.

19:42.999 --> 19:46.999
AS WE SELL FRANCHISES

19:42.999 --> 19:46.999
AROUND THE COUNTRY,

19:46.999 --> 19:49.999
WE WILL SHARE IN EVERYTHING

19:46.999 --> 19:49.999
WE DO GOING FORWARD.

19:49.999 --> 19:50.999
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

19:50.999 --> 19:53.999
Mike: UM...

19:53.999 --> 19:56.999
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S...

19:56.999 --> 19:57.999
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ENOUGH,

19:57.999 --> 20:02.999
BASED ON THE POTENTIAL

19:57.999 --> 20:02.999
THAT OUR CONCEPT HAS.

20:02.999 --> 20:04.999
Lemonis: THE POTENTIAL

20:02.999 --> 20:04.999
THAT I'M GONNA CREATE?

20:04.999 --> 20:05.999
Mike:

20:04.999 --> 20:05.999
BECAUSE OF THE HARD WORK

20:05.999 --> 20:08.999
THAT I'M WILLING TO PUT IN

20:05.999 --> 20:08.999
DOWN THE ROAD,

20:08.999 --> 20:10.999
YOU ARE GONNA REAP THE BENEFITS

20:10.999 --> 20:14.999
THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW

20:10.999 --> 20:14.999
WERE CAPABLE OF BEING REACHED.

20:14.999 --> 20:16.999
I WANT YOU TO, I DON'T KNOW,

20:16.999 --> 20:17.999
PUT A LITTLE BIT MORE FAITH

20:16.999 --> 20:17.999
IN US,

20:17.999 --> 20:19.999
JUST LIKE WE'RE PUTTING IN YOU,

20:19.999 --> 20:20.999
-EVEN THOUGH IT'S HARD TO DO.

20:19.999 --> 20:20.999
-Lemonis: I HAVE FAITH IN YOU.

20:20.999 --> 20:22.000
I'M PUTTING A CHECK

20:20.999 --> 20:22.000
ON THE TABLE.

20:22.999 --> 20:23.999
SO, DO WE HAVE A DEAL

20:22.999 --> 20:23.999
AT $350,000?

20:23.999 --> 20:25.999
'CAUSE I'M NOT WILLING

20:23.999 --> 20:25.999
TO PAY MORE.

20:25.999 --> 20:27.999
AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK,

20:25.999 --> 20:27.999
I UNDERSTAND.

20:29.999 --> 20:31.999
Kathleen:

20:29.999 --> 20:31.999
I-I-I'M READY TO MAKE A DEAL.

20:31.999 --> 20:33.999
I-I-I-I'M READY.

20:33.999 --> 20:34.999
YEAH.

20:37.999 --> 20:42.999
Mike: 45% OF A LOT IS BETTER OFF

20:37.999 --> 20:42.999
THAN 100% OF A LITTLE.

20:44.999 --> 20:45.999
Lemonis: DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

20:45.999 --> 20:46.999
-Kathleen: WE GOT A DEAL.

20:45.999 --> 20:46.999
-Lemonis: ALL RIGHT.

20:46.999 --> 20:48.999
Kathleen:

20:46.999 --> 20:48.999
I'M READY FOR NEW BEGINNINGS.

20:48.999 --> 20:49.999
Mike: MM!

20:49.999 --> 20:51.999
Lemonis:

20:49.999 --> 20:51.999
I'M INVESTING $350,000

20:52.000 --> 20:54.999
THAT'S ALL GONNA GO INTO

20:52.000 --> 20:54.999
THE FRANCHISEE LOCATIONS.

20:54.999 --> 20:56.999
TODAY, FIVE FRANCHISE LOCATIONS

20:57.000 --> 20:59.999
PAY THE PARENT COMPANY

20:57.000 --> 20:59.999
$65,000 IN FEES.

20:59.999 --> 21:05.999
SO STARTING DAY ONE,

20:59.999 --> 21:05.999
I GET 55% OF THAT -- $35,750.

21:05.999 --> 21:07.999
IF I CAN IMPROVE THEIR BUSINESS

21:05.999 --> 21:07.999
COLLECTIVELY

21:07.999 --> 21:09.999
$1 MILLION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS,

21:09.999 --> 21:13.999
THE FRANCHISOR WILL COLLECT

21:09.999 --> 21:13.999
AN ADDITIONAL $50,000.

21:13.999 --> 21:17.999
MY SHARE OF THAT

21:13.999 --> 21:17.999
WILL BE $27,500,

21:17.999 --> 21:21.999
TAKING MY TOTAL RETURN

21:17.999 --> 21:21.999
TO $63,250,

21:21.999 --> 21:23.999
AN 18% ANNUAL RETURN.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.999
NOW YOU CAN SEE WHY I'M

21:24.000 --> 21:26.999
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FRANCHISEES.

21:26.999 --> 21:28.999
IF THEY WIN, I WIN.

21:32.999 --> 21:34.999
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

21:36.999 --> 21:38.999
GATHER OVER THERE.

21:40.999 --> 21:42.999
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

21:42.999 --> 21:45.999
THAT THE THREE OF US

21:42.999 --> 21:45.999
HAVE MADE A DEAL.

21:45.999 --> 21:47.999
WE'RE NOT GONNA FIX THIS PLACE

21:45.999 --> 21:47.999
IN A WEEK.

21:47.999 --> 21:50.999
IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME,

21:47.999 --> 21:50.999
AND WE'RE GONNA TRY THINGS.

21:50.999 --> 21:52.999
AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS

21:50.999 --> 21:52.999
GONNA BE FUN.

21:52.999 --> 21:56.999
BUT MY JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

21:52.999 --> 21:56.999
YOU GUYS HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE.

21:56.999 --> 21:57.999
Andreas:

21:56.999 --> 21:57.999
YOU GUYS DESERVE THIS,

21:57.999 --> 21:58.999
AND WE'RE GONNA

21:57.999 --> 21:58.999
WORK OUR ASSES OFF.

21:58.999 --> 21:59.999

22:13.999 --> 22:14.999
LET'S GO.

22:14.999 --> 22:15.999
Kathleen: WHOO!

22:15.999 --> 22:16.999
Lemonis:

22:15.999 --> 22:16.999
THE FIRST THING I'M GONNA DO

22:16.999 --> 22:18.999
IS NARROW THIS MENU.

22:18.999 --> 22:20.999
AND I WANT TO GET RID

22:18.999 --> 22:20.999
OF EVERYTHING THAT'S FROZEN.

22:20.999 --> 22:22.999
Kathleen:

22:20.999 --> 22:22.999
NO MORE CHEESE STICKS.

22:22.999 --> 22:23.999
Lemonis:

22:22.999 --> 22:23.999
IN ORDER FOR US TO IMPROVE

22:23.999 --> 22:25.999
THE PROFITABILITY

22:23.999 --> 22:25.999
OF THIS BUSINESS,

22:25.999 --> 22:27.999
WE HAVE TO ADD MORE AUTHENTIC,

22:25.999 --> 22:27.999
HOMEMADE GREEK ITEMS.

22:27.999 --> 22:29.999
WE'RE GREEK, OR WE'RE NOT GREEK.

22:29.999 --> 22:31.999
-WHAT ARE WE?

22:29.999 --> 22:31.999
-Woman: GREEK!

22:31.999 --> 22:33.999
Lemonis: IF WE DON'T MAKE IT,

22:33.999 --> 22:34.999
OUR MARGINS AREN'T GONNA BE

22:33.999 --> 22:34.999
GOOD ENOUGH.

22:34.999 --> 22:38.999
MUSHROOMS, CHICKEN TENDERS,

22:34.999 --> 22:38.999
TATER TOTS.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.999
WE'RE GONNA DONATE THIS FOOD.

22:40.999 --> 22:41.999
I DON'T WANT IT

22:40.999 --> 22:41.999
AROUND HERE ANYMORE.

22:41.999 --> 22:43.999
ALL RIGHT, LET'S HEAD DOWNTOWN.

22:43.999 --> 22:44.999
Mike: ALL RIGHT.

22:45.999 --> 22:47.999
Lemonis:

22:45.999 --> 22:47.999
THE NEXT THING I WANT TO DO

22:47.999 --> 22:49.999
IS TAKE KATHLEEN AND MIKE TO

22:47.999 --> 22:49.999
MEET WITH ALL THE FRANCHISEES.

22:49.999 --> 22:51.999
WHEN I FIRST MET

22:49.999 --> 22:51.999
A COUPLE OF THEM,

22:51.999 --> 22:53.999
IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS TO ME

22:51.999 --> 22:53.999
THAT MIKE AND KATHLEEN

22:53.999 --> 22:54.999
WERE WAY OUT OF TOUCH.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.999
MY INVESTMENT WASN'T

22:55.000 --> 22:57.999
INTO A SINGLE BUSINESS.

22:57.999 --> 22:58.999
IT WAS INTO A SYSTEM.

22:58.999 --> 23:00.999
I DON'T WANT FIVE RESTAURANTS.

23:00.999 --> 23:02.999
I WANT 50 OR 500.

23:02.999 --> 23:04.999
AND I WANT TO FIX

23:02.999 --> 23:04.999
THE RELATIONSHIP

23:04.999 --> 23:06.999
BETWEEN MIKE, KATHLEEN,

23:04.999 --> 23:06.999
AND THE FRANCHISEES.

23:06.999 --> 23:09.999
I WANTED TO GET YOU GUYS

23:06.999 --> 23:09.999
TOGETHER TODAY

23:09.999 --> 23:11.999
TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE

23:09.999 --> 23:11.999
ON WHAT'S TRANSPIRED,

23:11.999 --> 23:14.999
BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY,

23:11.999 --> 23:14.999
TO START THE PROCESS

23:14.999 --> 23:17.999
OF HAVING GOOD AND OPEN LINES

23:14.999 --> 23:17.999
OF COMMUNICATION.

23:17.999 --> 23:19.999
AND WHAT I THOUGHT

23:17.999 --> 23:19.999
I WAS COMING TO HELP

23:19.999 --> 23:22.999
WAS A VERY HEALTHY

23:19.999 --> 23:22.999
FRANCHISE ORGANIZATION

23:22.999 --> 23:24.999
THAT WANTED TO GROW.

23:24.999 --> 23:29.999
INSTEAD, WHAT I FOUND WAS A VERY

23:24.999 --> 23:29.999
UNHEALTHY FRANCHISE ORGANIZATION

23:29.999 --> 23:34.000
WHOSE FRANCHISEE/FRANCHISOR

23:29.999 --> 23:34.000
RELATIONSHIPS ARE BROKEN.

23:34.999 --> 23:38.999
AND SO THE DEAL THAT I MADE

23:34.999 --> 23:38.999
IS TO PUT $350,000 UP

23:38.999 --> 23:40.999
AT THE PARENT COMPANY,

23:38.999 --> 23:40.999
THE FRANCHISOR LEVEL.

23:40.999 --> 23:42.999
I'M GONNA TAKE THAT MONEY,

23:42.999 --> 23:45.999
AND I'M GONNA RE-INVEST AND

23:42.999 --> 23:45.999
HELP YOU FIX YOUR BUSINESSES.

23:45.999 --> 23:48.999
IN MY OPINION,

23:45.999 --> 23:48.999
I THINK WE'VE FAILED YOU GUYS,

23:48.999 --> 23:51.999
BUT I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU ON

23:48.999 --> 23:51.999
WHAT YOU THINK WE'VE DONE WRONG.

23:51.999 --> 23:53.999
Kane: WE'VE BEEN OPEN SINCE --

23:53.999 --> 23:55.999
IT WAS FOUR YEARS

23:53.999 --> 23:55.999
THIS PAST JUNE.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.999
WE HAVE YET TO MAKE MONEY.

23:57.999 --> 23:58.999
THE ONLY HELP WE EVER GOT

23:57.999 --> 23:58.999
FROM THEM

23:58.999 --> 23:59.999
WAS ON THE FIRST OF THE MONTH,

23:59.999 --> 24:01.999
THEY CAME AND PICKED UP

23:59.999 --> 24:01.999
THEIR ROYALTY CHECK.

24:03.999 --> 24:06.999
I MEAN, WE HAVE BEEN

24:03.999 --> 24:06.999
ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL

24:06.999 --> 24:08.999
SINCE MONTH TWO.

24:08.999 --> 24:09.999
I MEAN, WE'VE PUT OUR HEART

24:08.999 --> 24:09.999
AND SOUL INTO THIS.

24:09.999 --> 24:11.999
I LAY AWAKE AT NIGHT.

24:11.999 --> 24:13.999
Sasha: WITH THE ROYALTY FEES,

24:11.999 --> 24:13.999
I NEVER SAW THEM

24:13.999 --> 24:14.999
BEING PUT BACK

24:13.999 --> 24:14.999
INTO THE BUSINESS.

24:14.999 --> 24:16.999
THERE WAS NO VISIBILITY

24:14.999 --> 24:16.999
FOR THE BUSINESS IN GENERAL.

24:16.999 --> 24:18.999
ADVERTISING --

24:16.999 --> 24:18.999
YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL UP --

24:18.999 --> 24:20.999
LEFT TO DO THAT OURSELVES,

24:18.999 --> 24:20.999
AND THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

24:20.999 --> 24:23.999
Karla: I'M A SINGLE MOM.

24:20.999 --> 24:23.999
I CAN'T SUPPORT MY FAMILY.

24:23.999 --> 24:26.999
Rick: HAVING NOT DONE THIS

24:23.999 --> 24:26.999
BEFORE -- BEEN IN A FRANCHISE,

24:26.999 --> 24:28.999
I JUST ASSUMED

24:26.999 --> 24:28.999
THIS WAS THE WAY IT WAS.

24:29.999 --> 24:32.999
Rich: YOU KNOW, WE'VE NEVER

24:29.999 --> 24:32.999
COME TOGETHER AS A GROUP.

24:32.999 --> 24:33.999
Lemonis: IS THIS THE FIRST TIME

24:32.999 --> 24:33.999
YOU'VE EVER GOTTEN TOGETHER?

24:33.999 --> 24:34.999
Sasha:

24:33.999 --> 24:34.999
I'VE NEVER MET THESE PEOPLE.

24:34.999 --> 24:36.000
-Kathleen: AS A GROUP.

24:34.999 --> 24:36.000
-Lemonis: YOU NEVER MET THEM?

24:36.999 --> 24:37.999
Kane:

24:36.999 --> 24:37.999
WE WEREN'T EVEN ALLOWED TO TALK

24:37.999 --> 24:38.999
TO THE OTHER FRANCHISE PEOPLE.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.999
Mike: I DON'T WANT TO

24:38.999 --> 24:40.999
LOOK IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR

24:40.999 --> 24:42.999
AND SAY, "WOW, BOY,

24:40.999 --> 24:42.999
DID WE REALLY JACK THINGS UP."

24:42.999 --> 24:46.999
I CAN JUST LOOK AT WHERE WE'RE

24:42.999 --> 24:46.999
AT NOW AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO.

24:46.999 --> 24:47.999
Lemonis: YEAH,

24:46.999 --> 24:47.999
BUT IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD,

24:47.999 --> 24:49.999
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

24:47.999 --> 24:49.999
WHAT THE ISSUES ARE.

24:49.999 --> 24:51.999
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS MET

24:49.999 --> 24:51.999
ALL THE TIME.

24:51.999 --> 24:53.999
-Kane: NO.

24:51.999 --> 24:53.999
-Rick: NO.

24:53.999 --> 24:55.999
Rich: THAT'S PROBABLY ONE

24:53.999 --> 24:55.999
OF THE MOST UPSETTING ELEMENTS

24:55.999 --> 25:00.999
OF ME BEING IN THIS BUSINESS

24:55.999 --> 25:00.999
WAS THAT LACK OF SUPPORT.

25:00.999 --> 25:01.999
Lemonis: WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED

25:00.999 --> 25:01.999
ABOUT THE MOST?

25:01.999 --> 25:05.999
Rich: I HAVE TO RESPECT SOMEONE

25:01.999 --> 25:05.999
THAT I TAKE DIRECTION FROM.

25:05.999 --> 25:08.999
Lemonis: HAVE YOU LOST

25:05.999 --> 25:08.999
BUSINESS RESPECT FOR MIKE?

25:08.999 --> 25:11.999
Rich: I'VE LOST RESPECT FOR MIKE

25:08.999 --> 25:11.999
AS AN INDIVIDUAL.

25:14.999 --> 25:16.999
Lemonis: SO, THIS NAME CAME FROM

25:14.999 --> 25:16.999
A BRANDING EXPERT.

25:16.999 --> 25:17.999
Kathleen: I HATE THIS NAME.

25:17.999 --> 25:19.999
Lemonis: BUT YOU'RE NOT

25:17.999 --> 25:19.999
A BRANDING EXPERT.

25:19.999 --> 25:21.999
Kathleen: OKAY.

25:19.999 --> 25:21.999
I'M OFFENDED.

25:21.999 --> 25:22.999
Lemonis:

25:21.999 --> 25:22.999
DON'T TRUST THE PROCESS?

25:22.999 --> 25:24.999
DON'T TAKE MY MONEY.

25:29.999 --> 25:31.999
Lemonis: HAVE YOU LOST BUSINESS

25:29.999 --> 25:31.999
RESPECT FOR MIKE?

25:31.999 --> 25:34.999
Rich: I'VE LOST RESPECT FOR MIKE

25:31.999 --> 25:34.999
AS AN INDIVIDUAL.

25:34.999 --> 25:36.999
Lemonis: THE FACT THAT

25:34.999 --> 25:36.999
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TOGETHER --

25:36.999 --> 25:39.999
YOU GUYS HAVEN'T GOTTEN TOGETHER

25:36.999 --> 25:39.999
AS A GROUP IS MIND-BOGGLING.

25:39.999 --> 25:41.999
Sasha: IT'S MIND-BLOWING

25:39.999 --> 25:41.999
TO ME THAT WE JUST DIDN'T,

25:41.999 --> 25:42.999
EVEN ONCE A YEAR,

25:41.999 --> 25:42.999
HAVE A MEETING.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.999
Kane: "YOU BOUGHT THE NAME.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.999
GO DO IT."

25:44.999 --> 25:46.999
Lemonis: WELL, THE NAME

25:44.999 --> 25:46.999
YOU BOUGHT, BY THE WAY,

25:46.999 --> 25:47.999
ISN'T ALLOWED TO BE USED.

25:47.999 --> 25:50.999
FIRST TIME

25:47.999 --> 25:50.999
YOU EVER HEARD ABOUT THIS?

25:50.999 --> 25:52.999
Sasha: YES.

25:52.999 --> 25:53.999
Kane: WHY ISN'T SOME OF THAT

25:52.999 --> 25:53.999
COMMUNICATED?

25:53.999 --> 25:56.999
DO WE NOT DESERVE TO KNOW

25:53.999 --> 25:56.999
SOME OF THESE THINGS?

25:56.999 --> 25:58.999
Kathleen: NO, YOU DEFINITELY

25:56.999 --> 25:58.999
DESERVE TO KNOW.

25:58.999 --> 25:59.999
Kane:

25:58.999 --> 25:59.999
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN THAT?

25:59.999 --> 26:01.999
Mike: THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON

25:59.999 --> 26:01.999
FOR YEARS.

26:01.999 --> 26:02.999
Rick: WHAT WE THOUGHT

26:01.999 --> 26:02.999
WE WERE PAYING FOR

26:03.000 --> 26:04.999
WAS "MY BIG FAT GREEK GYRO"

26:03.000 --> 26:04.999
NAME.

26:04.999 --> 26:05.999
Lemonis: HERE'S THE DEAL.

26:05.999 --> 26:08.999
THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF.

26:05.999 --> 26:08.999
IT'S ME.

26:08.999 --> 26:09.999
WHAT ARE YOUR TOTAL SALES?

26:09.999 --> 26:11.999
Kane: $261,000.

26:11.999 --> 26:12.999
Lemonis:

26:11.999 --> 26:12.999
AND HOW MUCH DID YOU MAKE?

26:12.999 --> 26:13.999
Kane: NOTHING.

26:13.999 --> 26:15.999
Lemonis:

26:13.999 --> 26:15.999
DOES YOUR BUSINESS MAKE MONEY?

26:15.999 --> 26:16.999
Rick: NO.

26:15.999 --> 26:16.999
NO, I PUT MONEY INTO IT.

26:16.999 --> 26:17.999
Sasha: WE DON'T MAKE MONEY.

26:17.999 --> 26:19.999
Lemonis: YOU DON'T MAKE MONEY?

26:19.999 --> 26:21.999
SO, NO ONE HERE'S MAKING MONEY

26:19.999 --> 26:21.999
EXCEPT YOU GUYS.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.999
IN MY OPINION,

26:23.999 --> 26:25.999
MIKE AND KATHLEEN HAVE

26:23.999 --> 26:25.999
A BIG PROBLEM ON THEIR HANDS.

26:25.999 --> 26:27.999
THEY SOLD PEOPLE

26:25.999 --> 26:27.999
ON THIS CONCEPT,

26:27.999 --> 26:28.999
BUT THE EXECUTION

26:27.999 --> 26:28.999
HAS BEEN HORRIBLE.

26:28.999 --> 26:30.999
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN CHARGE

26:28.999 --> 26:30.999
OF THINGS

26:30.999 --> 26:34.999
LIKE PROCESS, DIRECTION,

26:30.999 --> 26:34.999
GIVING THESE PEOPLE GUIDANCE.

26:34.999 --> 26:36.999
THEY HAVEN'T DONE

26:34.999 --> 26:36.999
ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

26:36.999 --> 26:38.999
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR

26:36.999 --> 26:38.999
FROM PEOPLE IS FOR THEM

26:38.999 --> 26:40.999
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

26:38.999 --> 26:40.999
FOR THEIR ACTIONS.

26:40.999 --> 26:41.999
Kane: RIGHT.

26:41.999 --> 26:43.999
Lemonis: DO YOU GUYS FEEL LIKE

26:41.999 --> 26:43.999
THEY FAILED YOU?

26:43.999 --> 26:44.999
-Kane: YES.

26:43.999 --> 26:44.999
-Karla: YES.

26:44.999 --> 26:46.999
Rick: YEAH.

26:48.999 --> 26:50.999
Mike: I'M GONNA REITERATE

26:48.999 --> 26:50.999
FOR THE 50th TIME.

26:50.999 --> 26:52.999
Lemonis:

26:50.999 --> 26:52.999
WITHOUT BEING CONDESCENDING.

26:52.999 --> 26:56.999
Kane:

26:52.999 --> 26:56.999
'CAUSE YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT.

26:56.999 --> 26:57.999
Mike: WE HAVE SCREWED UP.

26:57.999 --> 26:59.999
AND I MEAN THAT SINCERELY.

26:59.999 --> 27:02.999
IT KILLS ME TO KNOW

26:59.999 --> 27:02.999
THAT WE'RE IN THIS SITUATION

27:02.999 --> 27:05.999
BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT

27:02.999 --> 27:05.999
FOLLOWED THROUGH

27:05.999 --> 27:08.999
WITH WHAT YOU HAD

27:05.999 --> 27:08.999
EXPECTED US TO DO.

27:08.999 --> 27:10.999
I TAKE ABSOLUTE

27:08.999 --> 27:10.999
FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

27:10.999 --> 27:15.999
WE DID NOT RE-INVEST OURSELVES

27:10.999 --> 27:15.999
OR HELP YOU GROW.

27:15.999 --> 27:20.999
WE HAVE FAILED YOU MISERABLY

27:15.999 --> 27:20.999
IN NOT ACCEPTING YOUR VOICE.

27:20.999 --> 27:23.999
YOU GUYS NOT ONLY BOUGHT

27:20.999 --> 27:23.999
INTO THE CONCEPT,

27:23.999 --> 27:26.999
BUT I THINK, MORE IMPORTANTLY,

27:23.999 --> 27:26.999
YOU BOUGHT INTO US.

27:26.999 --> 27:30.999
AND THE FACT THAT WE HAD FAILED

27:26.999 --> 27:30.999
HURTS ME A LOT.

27:30.999 --> 27:33.999
IT DOES.

27:33.999 --> 27:36.999
Karla:

27:33.999 --> 27:36.999
I'M SO GLAD THIS DAY CAME

27:36.999 --> 27:39.999
BECAUSE THERE ARE DAYS

27:36.999 --> 27:39.999
THAT I HAVE JUST --

27:39.999 --> 27:41.999
COULDN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT

27:39.999 --> 27:41.999
AND CRIED MYSELF

27:41.999 --> 27:44.999
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY

27:41.999 --> 27:44.999
TO INVEST.

27:44.999 --> 27:46.999
Kane: WE CAN'T FIX IT.

27:44.999 --> 27:46.999
FINANCIALLY, WE CAN'T FIX IT.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.999
I'VE TAKEN ALL THE MONEY I CAN.

27:52.999 --> 27:54.999
Lemonis: WE'RE MOVING FORWARD.

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
WE ARE GONNA COME UP

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
WITH A NEW NAME,

27:57.999 --> 28:00.999
BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY,

27:57.999 --> 28:00.999
WE'RE CHANGING THE CONCEPT.

28:00.999 --> 28:02.999
IF YOU FOLLOW THE PROCESS,

28:02.999 --> 28:04.999
I'M GONNA PUT AS MUCH MONEY

28:02.999 --> 28:04.999
AS I HAVE TO

28:04.999 --> 28:05.999
TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL.

28:05.999 --> 28:08.999
LOOK, CHANGE IS DIFFICULT,

28:05.999 --> 28:08.999
RIGHT?

28:08.999 --> 28:09.999
IT'S VERY HARD.

28:09.999 --> 28:11.999
BUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE

28:09.999 --> 28:11.999
A LOT OF MONEY TOGETHER.

28:11.999 --> 28:13.999
Sasha: I'M READY.

28:11.999 --> 28:13.999
I'M READY FOR THAT.

28:13.999 --> 28:16.999
IN MT. LEBANON, I'M GONNA MAKE

28:13.999 --> 28:16.999
THAT PLACE LOOK AWESOME.

28:17.999 --> 28:19.999
LOOK, CHANGE IS DIFFICULT.

28:19.999 --> 28:23.999
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN TOMORROW.

28:19.999 --> 28:23.999
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN RIGHT NOW.

28:23.999 --> 28:25.999
WE'RE GONNA START

28:23.999 --> 28:25.999
THE PROCESS NOW.

28:25.999 --> 28:26.999
Sasha:

28:25.999 --> 28:26.999
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

28:26.999 --> 28:29.999
[ APPLAUSE ]

28:32.999 --> 28:34.999
Lemonis: YOU KNOW,

28:32.999 --> 28:34.999
I CAN'T BE HERE EVERY DAY.

28:34.999 --> 28:35.999
Mike: I KNOW.

28:35.999 --> 28:37.999
Lemonis:

28:35.999 --> 28:37.999
AND THESE PEOPLE WANT A LEADER.

28:37.999 --> 28:39.999
AND I DON'T KNOW

28:37.999 --> 28:39.999
IF YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

28:39.999 --> 28:40.999
Mike: OH, I'M READY.

28:40.999 --> 28:42.999
AND I'M MORE THAN CAPABLE

28:40.999 --> 28:42.999
OF CARRYING THE LOAD.

28:42.999 --> 28:45.999
Lemonis: I WANT TO TELL YOU

28:42.999 --> 28:45.999
THAT I'M CONVINCED, BUT I'M NOT.

28:47.999 --> 28:50.999
I HATE PUTTING MY NAME ON THINGS

28:47.999 --> 28:50.999
THAT PEOPLE AREN'T PROUD OF.

28:50.999 --> 28:53.000
I HATE IT.

28:50.999 --> 28:53.000
I HATE IT.

28:53.999 --> 28:54.999
-IT'S A BIG DEAL FOR ME.

28:53.999 --> 28:54.999
-Mike: I'M MORE PROUD OF THIS

28:54.999 --> 28:56.999
THAN I'VE EVER BEEN PROUD

28:54.999 --> 28:56.999
OF ANYTHING.

28:56.999 --> 28:57.999
Lemonis: YOU SHOULDN'T BE PROUD

28:56.999 --> 28:57.999
OF THIS RIGHT NOW.

28:57.999 --> 28:59.000
IT'S A DISASTER.

28:59.999 --> 29:00.999
THE ONLY WAY

28:59.999 --> 29:00.999
THIS IS GONNA WORK --

29:00.999 --> 29:03.999
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE

29:00.999 --> 29:03.999
VERY SPECIFIC DIRECTION FROM ME

29:03.999 --> 29:05.999
BECAUSE IF WE TELL THEM

29:03.999 --> 29:05.999
ONE THING

29:05.999 --> 29:07.999
AND WE DO SOMETHING ELSE,

29:07.999 --> 29:08.999
I'LL HAVE TO FIRE YOU.

29:08.999 --> 29:11.999
I THINK YOU SOLD THEM

29:08.999 --> 29:11.999
A BILL OF GOODS,

29:11.999 --> 29:14.000
AND YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW THROUGH.

29:14.999 --> 29:17.999
I NEED TO GET CONVINCED THAT

29:14.999 --> 29:17.999
YOU'RE THE RIGHT GUY TO LEAD.

29:23.999 --> 29:25.999
Kathleen: I'M JUST SO GLAD

29:23.999 --> 29:25.999
THIS ALL CAME TO A HEAD

29:25.999 --> 29:26.999
BECAUSE IT NEEDED TO HAPPEN.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.999
WE NEED TO MAKE THINGS BETTER.

29:28.999 --> 29:31.000
Mike: I JUST FEEL HORRIBLE

29:28.999 --> 29:31.000
THAT YOU FIND OUT

29:31.999 --> 29:33.999
THAT PEOPLE LOSE RESPECT

29:31.999 --> 29:33.999
FOR YOU.

29:33.999 --> 29:34.999
WHEN RICH SAID THAT,

29:33.999 --> 29:34.999
THAT'S JUST --

29:34.999 --> 29:36.999
IT'S LIKE A PUNCH TO THE GUT.

29:36.999 --> 29:37.999
IT'S THE WORST.

29:37.999 --> 29:39.999
Kathleen: YOU GOT TO BUILD

29:37.999 --> 29:39.999
THAT RESPECT BACK UP

29:39.999 --> 29:41.999
BECAUSE IT'S THE LAST THING

29:39.999 --> 29:41.999
YOU NEED.

29:41.999 --> 29:42.999
Mike:

29:41.999 --> 29:42.999
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

29:42.999 --> 29:44.000
LITTLE BY LITTLE, DAY BY DAY.

29:44.999 --> 29:45.999
-Kathleen: I KNOW.

29:44.999 --> 29:45.999
-Mike: I'M READY.

29:45.999 --> 29:47.999
TIME TO STEP IT UP

29:45.999 --> 29:47.999
AND MAKE IT RIGHT.

29:58.999 --> 30:01.999
Lemonis: I BROUGHT THE TEAM

29:58.999 --> 30:01.999
TO A NEW SUSHI CONCEPT

30:01.999 --> 30:02.999
IN DOWNTOWN PITTSBURGH

30:02.999 --> 30:04.999
THAT I FEEL HAS

30:02.999 --> 30:04.999
A REALLY CUTTING-EDGE IDEA.

30:04.999 --> 30:08.999
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS PLACE

30:04.999 --> 30:08.999
IS HOW SIMPLE AND CLEAN IT IS.

30:08.999 --> 30:11.999
THIS IS THE BASE.

30:08.999 --> 30:11.999
ADD WHAT YOU WANT.

30:11.999 --> 30:13.999
HERE ARE OUR SIDES.

30:11.999 --> 30:13.999
AND HERE'S WHAT'S FEATURED.

30:13.999 --> 30:15.999
THE MENU'S SIMPLE,

30:13.999 --> 30:15.999
AND IT'S EASY TO ORDER.

30:15.999 --> 30:17.999
NOT ONLY DOES IT MAKE

30:15.999 --> 30:17.999
THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE BETTER,

30:17.999 --> 30:20.000
BUT IT MAKES IT A HECK

30:17.999 --> 30:20.000
OF A LOT EASIER FOR THE STAFF.

30:20.999 --> 30:21.999
Kathleen:

30:20.999 --> 30:21.999
BEAUTIFUL PRESENTATION.

30:21.999 --> 30:22.999
VERY NICE.

30:22.999 --> 30:23.999
Lemonis:

30:22.999 --> 30:23.999
AND THERE'S LESS WASTE.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.999
AND LESS WASTE MEANS MORE MONEY.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.999
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD

30:26.000 --> 30:27.999
EXECUTE THIS

30:27.999 --> 30:28.999
-AT YOUR PLACE?

30:27.999 --> 30:28.999
-Andreas: FOR SURE.

30:28.999 --> 30:30.999
Lemonis: IF YOU'RE GIVING THEM

30:28.999 --> 30:30.999
DIFFERENT WAYS

30:30.999 --> 30:31.999
TO USE THE ASSETS THAT YOU HAVE,

30:31.999 --> 30:34.999
THEN I CAN ONE DAY COME

30:31.999 --> 30:34.999
AND HAVE A PITA SANDWICH,

30:34.999 --> 30:37.999
ANOTHER DAY COME

30:34.999 --> 30:37.999
AND HAVE A RICE BOWL,

30:37.999 --> 30:39.999
ANOTHER DAY

30:37.999 --> 30:39.999
COME AND HAVE A SALAD.

30:39.999 --> 30:42.999
AND SO THE GOAL WOULD BE TO

30:39.999 --> 30:42.999
INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF VISIT.

30:42.999 --> 30:43.999
Andreas: FOR SURE.

30:43.999 --> 30:44.999
Lemonis: DO YOU GUYS --

30:44.999 --> 30:45.999
STARTING TO GET THE IDEA

30:44.999 --> 30:45.999
OF WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR?

30:45.999 --> 30:47.999
-Kathleen: ABSOLUTELY.

30:45.999 --> 30:47.999
-Michael: ABSOLUTELY.

30:47.999 --> 30:50.999
IT'S A SIMPLE PROCESS WHERE

30:47.999 --> 30:50.999
YOU GO INTO AN ORDERING SYSTEM

30:50.999 --> 30:53.999
AND YOU GO STATION BY STATION,

30:50.999 --> 30:53.999
BUILDING YOUR OWN INGREDIENTS.

30:53.999 --> 30:55.999
THIS IS KNOWN AS FAST CASUAL.

30:55.999 --> 30:58.999
WHILE THERE'S PLENTY

30:55.999 --> 30:58.999
OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES

30:55.999 --> 30:58.999
FOR CONCEPTS LIKE THIS,

30:58.999 --> 31:01.999
NO ONE IS DOING IT

30:58.999 --> 31:01.999
IN THE GREEK FOOD BUSINESS.

31:03.999 --> 31:05.999
WITH THE NEW CONCEPT IN PLACE,

31:05.999 --> 31:07.999
I WANT TO MAKE ONE FRANCHISE

31:05.999 --> 31:07.999
A PROTOTYPE,

31:07.999 --> 31:10.999
SO I'M STARTING WITH MT. LEBANON

31:07.999 --> 31:10.999
BECAUSE IT'S IN THE WORST SHAPE.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.999
THIS WON'T BE A BAR ANYMORE.

31:12.999 --> 31:14.999
THIS IS PRETTY MUCH

31:12.999 --> 31:14.999
PRESENTATION.

31:14.999 --> 31:15.999
Jace: THIS IS IT, YEAH.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.999
Lemonis: AND SO THE CUSTOMER

31:15.999 --> 31:17.999
WILL COME DOWN,

31:17.999 --> 31:18.999
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY

31:17.999 --> 31:18.999
WHERE THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

31:18.999 --> 31:20.999
AND SO WE'LL PROBABLY

31:18.999 --> 31:20.999
ADJUST THIS A LITTLE BIT.

31:20.999 --> 31:23.999
WE'LL CUT IT DOWN

31:20.999 --> 31:23.999
SO THAT IT'S A.D.A. COMPLIANT,

31:23.999 --> 31:26.999
BUT WE'LL ALSO PUT

31:23.999 --> 31:26.999
A BLOCKER HERE.

31:26.999 --> 31:28.999
WITH MORE SIMPLE ELEMENTS

31:26.999 --> 31:28.999
AND CLEANER LINES,

31:28.999 --> 31:30.999
IT'S EASIER TO DUPLICATE.

31:30.999 --> 31:32.999
WHETHER IT'S THIS BOX

31:30.999 --> 31:32.999
OR 100 OTHER BOXES,

31:32.999 --> 31:34.999
WE COULD SCALE THIS

31:32.999 --> 31:34.999
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

31:34.999 --> 31:37.999
DO YOU WANT THEM TO PAY FIRST

31:34.999 --> 31:37.999
OR PAY LAST?

31:37.999 --> 31:39.999
Jace: DEFINITELY LAST 'CAUSE YOU

31:37.999 --> 31:39.999
CAN UP-SELL THINGS

31:39.999 --> 31:40.999
-AT THE END.

31:39.999 --> 31:40.999
-Lemonis: PERFECT.

31:40.999 --> 31:42.999
WE'RE GONNA PROBABLY HAVE

31:40.999 --> 31:42.999
TO CLOSE FOR A COUPLE WEEKS.

31:42.999 --> 31:44.999
GET THIS STUFF DONE, ALL RIGHT?

31:45.999 --> 31:48.999
OUR NEXT STEP IS TO MAKE

31:45.999 --> 31:48.999
OUR OWN FOOD FIT THIS MODEL.

31:50.999 --> 31:53.999
SO YOU'RE GONNA GET THESE

31:50.999 --> 31:53.999
GREEN BEANS CUT AND SEASONED.

31:54.999 --> 31:58.999
WE'RE GONNA SEASON OUR CHICKEN

31:54.999 --> 31:58.999
WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE LEMON,

31:58.999 --> 31:59.999
A LITTLE BIT MORE

31:58.999 --> 31:59.999
SALT AND PEPPER.

31:59.999 --> 32:03.999
SO I WANT TO GET THE GREEK

31:59.999 --> 32:03.999
FLAVORS UP IN ALL THE FOOD.

32:03.999 --> 32:07.999
INSTEAD OF USING WATER

32:03.999 --> 32:07.999
AND GREEK RICE,

32:07.999 --> 32:08.999
I USE CHICKEN BROTH.

32:08.999 --> 32:10.999
WATCH THIS.

32:10.999 --> 32:12.999
SEE, IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT

32:10.999 --> 32:12.999
OF CHAR ON IT.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.999
Mike:

32:12.999 --> 32:14.999
MORE DILL, LESS CUCUMBER?

32:14.999 --> 32:15.999
Lemonis:

32:14.999 --> 32:15.999
I THINK IT'S PERFECT.

32:15.999 --> 32:16.999
Jace: OPA!

32:16.999 --> 32:17.999
Kathleen: THAT'S IT!

32:17.999 --> 32:19.999
YOU GOT THAT.

32:17.999 --> 32:19.999
I LIKE THAT THE BEST.

32:19.999 --> 32:22.999
Lemonis: NOW THAT WE'VE MADE

32:19.999 --> 32:22.999
A SIMPLE AND AUTHENTIC MENU,

32:22.999 --> 32:23.999
I WANT TO SHOW THE TEAM

32:23.999 --> 32:24.999
HOW WE'RE GONNA SERVICE

32:23.999 --> 32:24.999
OUR CUSTOMERS.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.999
OKAY, COME ON UP.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.999
Kane: HELLO.

32:28.999 --> 32:30.999
Jace: WOULD YOU LIKE TO

32:28.999 --> 32:30.999
START OFF WITH A BOWL OR PITA?

32:30.999 --> 32:31.999
Kane: A BOWL, PLEASE.

32:31.999 --> 32:32.999
Jace: BOWL?

32:39.999 --> 32:40.999
Lemonis: HOW'S THAT BOWL?

32:40.999 --> 32:42.999
Kane: GREAT.

32:49.999 --> 32:50.999
Jace: WHAT'S UP?

32:50.999 --> 32:52.999
Kathleen: HEY, GUYS,

32:50.999 --> 32:52.999
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

32:52.999 --> 32:54.999
WHERE'S THE CONSTRUCTION PEOPLE?

32:54.999 --> 32:56.999
Rick:

32:54.999 --> 32:56.999
DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.

32:56.999 --> 32:57.999
Jace: YEAH, I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

32:57.999 --> 32:58.999
Mike: WHEN DID THEY START?

32:58.999 --> 32:59.999
Jace: ON WEDNESDAY.

32:59.999 --> 33:01.999
Mike: HOW LONG DID THEY SAY

32:59.999 --> 33:01.999
IT WAS GONNA TAKE?

33:01.999 --> 33:03.999
Jace:

33:01.999 --> 33:03.999
THEY SAID LIKE 10 DAYS.

33:03.999 --> 33:05.999
Mike:

33:03.999 --> 33:05.999
THIS IS DAY NUMBER THREE.

33:05.999 --> 33:06.999
THESE FLOORS

33:05.999 --> 33:06.999
DON'T LAY THEMSELVES.

33:06.999 --> 33:09.999
Kathleen: THIS IS NEVER

33:06.999 --> 33:09.999
GONNA BE DONE IN 10 DAYS.

33:09.999 --> 33:11.999
DID THEY SAY

33:09.999 --> 33:11.999
WHEN THEY WOULD BE BACK?

33:11.999 --> 33:14.999
Jace: I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA

33:11.999 --> 33:14.999
BE HERE AT 8:00 THIS MORNING.

33:14.999 --> 33:16.999
-Kathleen: WHAT TIME IS IT?

33:14.999 --> 33:16.999
-Mike: 9:20, ALMOST.

33:16.999 --> 33:18.999
-Jace: YEAH.

33:16.999 --> 33:18.999
-Kathleen: WOW.

33:18.999 --> 33:19.999
Mike: WHY DON'T YOU CALL HIM

33:18.999 --> 33:19.999
AND SEE WHERE HE'S AT?

33:19.999 --> 33:22.999
SAY WE'RE A LITTLE ANXIOUS

33:19.999 --> 33:22.999
TO GET THIS BALL ROLLING.

33:22.999 --> 33:24.999
Kathleen: TELL HIM,

33:22.999 --> 33:24.999
"THIS IS MY LIVELIHOOD."

33:24.999 --> 33:25.999
DEREK:

33:24.999 --> 33:25.999
Yeah, what's up, buddy?

33:25.999 --> 33:27.999
Mike: HEY, DEREK.

33:27.999 --> 33:29.000
DEREK: Yeah. How are you?

33:29.999 --> 33:30.999
Mike: I'M -- I'D PROBABLY BE

33:29.999 --> 33:30.999
A LOT BETTER

33:30.999 --> 33:32.999
IF THERE WERE GUYS HERE WORKING.

33:32.999 --> 33:34.999
WHAT TIME

33:32.999 --> 33:34.999
ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO BE HERE?

33:34.999 --> 33:36.999
DEREK: I don't know

33:34.999 --> 33:36.999
what the schedule is 'cause --

33:36.999 --> 33:37.999
Kathleen: WHAT?

33:37.999 --> 33:39.999
Mike: IS THERE A DIFFERENT

33:37.999 --> 33:39.999
CONTACT NUMBER

33:39.999 --> 33:41.999
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE

33:39.999 --> 33:41.999
OTHER THAN YOURS

33:41.999 --> 33:43.999
SO WE CAN KIND OF COORDINATE THE

33:41.999 --> 33:43.999
SCHEDULES A LITTLE BIT BETTER?

33:43.999 --> 33:45.999
DEREK:

33:43.999 --> 33:45.999
No, I'll get it figured out.

33:45.999 --> 33:48.999
Mike: I THINK

33:45.999 --> 33:48.999
WE WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION

33:48.999 --> 33:51.000
THAT THIS BUILD-OUT WOULD TAKE

33:48.999 --> 33:51.000
ABOUT 10 DAYS.

33:51.999 --> 33:52.999
DEREK: Absolutely.

33:52.999 --> 33:53.999

33:52.999 --> 33:53.999

33:53.999 --> 33:55.999
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT,

33:55.999 --> 33:57.999
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SEE THE

33:55.999 --> 33:57.999

33:57.999 --> 33:59.999
DEREK: Right.

but I'll find out right now.

34:16.998 --> 34:17.998

34:20.998 --> 34:22.998
WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

34:20.998 --> 34:22.998
WELL, DON'T LET US HOLD YOU UP.

34:22.998 --> 34:24.998
Lemonis: MIKE HAS SEVEN DAYS

34:22.998 --> 34:24.998
TO HELP ME IMPLEMENT

34:24.998 --> 34:26.998
THE RENOVATION

34:24.998 --> 34:26.998
OF THE MT. LEBANON LOCATION.

34:26.998 --> 34:27.998
I WANT TO BRIGHTEN UP THE PLACE

34:27.998 --> 34:31.998
BY PUTTING IN SUBWAY-TILE WALLS

34:27.998 --> 34:31.998
AND NEW LIGHT FIXTURES.

34:31.998 --> 34:33.998
A NEW COUNTER AND SERVING AREA

34:31.998 --> 34:33.998
WILL BE BUILT

34:33.998 --> 34:36.998
TO IMPROVE AND STREAMLINE

34:33.998 --> 34:36.998
THE ORDERING PROCESS.

34:36.998 --> 34:39.998
NEW TABLES, NEW EQUIPMENT,

34:36.998 --> 34:39.998
AND NEW FLOORS.

34:39.998 --> 34:44.998
IN ALL, I'M SPENDING $85,000

34:39.998 --> 34:44.998
OF THE $350,000 I INVESTED.

34:44.998 --> 34:47.998
IT'S A BIG RENOVATION

34:44.998 --> 34:47.998
FOR A PRETTY SMALL SPACE.

HEY, GUYS.

34:56.998 --> 34:57.999
-Mike: HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

34:56.998 --> 34:57.999
-Kathleen: HI!

34:57.999 --> 34:59.999
Lemonis: I'M REALLY EXCITED

34:57.999 --> 34:59.999
TO GATHER UP THE FRANCHISEES

34:59.999 --> 35:00.999
AT MARKET SQUARE.

35:00.999 --> 35:03.999
I WANT TO SHOW THEM THE NEW LOOK

35:00.999 --> 35:03.999
AND THE NEW NAME --

35:03.999 --> 35:04.999
THE SIMPLE GREEK.

35:04.999 --> 35:07.999
Lemonis: SO, THIS NAME CAME

35:04.999 --> 35:07.999
FROM A BRANDING EXPERT.

35:07.999 --> 35:10.999
Kathleen:

35:07.999 --> 35:10.999
UM, "SIMPLE GREEK"?

35:10.999 --> 35:12.999
I'M OFFENDED.

35:12.999 --> 35:14.000
Mike: THE FEELING THAT I GET

35:12.999 --> 35:14.000
IS THAT WHEN YOU SAY,

35:14.999 --> 35:15.999
"THE SIMPLE GREEK," IT'S ALMOST,

35:14.999 --> 35:15.999
LIKE, CONDESCENDING.

35:15.999 --> 35:17.999
LIKE YOU'RE CALLING THEM

35:15.999 --> 35:17.999
SOMEBODY NOT TOO SMART,

35:17.999 --> 35:19.999
LIKE A VERY SIMPLE PERSON,

35:17.999 --> 35:19.999
LIKE A SIMPLE ARSE.

35:19.999 --> 35:22.999
IT'S A MATTER OF SEMANTICS,

35:19.999 --> 35:22.999
IF YOU WILL.

35:22.999 --> 35:24.999
Lemonis: NOW, WITH ALL

35:22.999 --> 35:24.999
DUE RESPECT, YOU'RE NOT GREEK.

35:24.999 --> 35:26.999
I'M GREEK.

35:24.999 --> 35:26.999
I'M NOT OFFENDED BY IT.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.999
I DON'T FEEL LIKE

35:26.999 --> 35:28.999
YOU'RE CALLING ME STUPID.

35:28.999 --> 35:29.999
Kathleen: I'M OFFENDED.

35:29.999 --> 35:31.999
Lemonis: SO THAT'S ONE TO ONE SO

35:29.999 --> 35:31.999
FAR IN TERMS OF BEING OFFENDED.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.999
Kathleen: ARE YOU OFFENDED?

35:33.999 --> 35:36.999
Andreas: INITIALLY, I DIDN'T

35:33.999 --> 35:36.999
REALLY LIKE "THE SIMPLE GREEK,"

35:36.999 --> 35:38.999
BUT WHEN I SEE IT ON PAPER,

35:36.999 --> 35:38.999
IT DOESN'T REALLY BOTHER ME.

35:38.999 --> 35:40.999
Lemonis: ARE YOU OFFENDED

35:38.999 --> 35:40.999
BY "THE SIMPLE GREEK"?

35:41.999 --> 35:42.999
-Michael: I COULD BE.

35:41.999 --> 35:42.999
-Lemonis: YOU COULD BE.

35:43.000 --> 35:43.999
Michael: YEAH.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.999
Kathleen: I HATE THIS NAME.

35:45.999 --> 35:48.999
Lemonis: BUT YOU'RE NOT

35:45.999 --> 35:48.999
A BRANDING EXPERT, AND I AM.

35:48.999 --> 35:50.999
HERE'S THE OPTION.

35:50.999 --> 35:53.999
BECAUSE I WANT TO RESPECT

35:50.999 --> 35:53.999
YOUR DECISION,

35:53.999 --> 35:55.999
YOU CAN CALL IT

35:53.999 --> 35:55.999
WHATEVER YOU WANT,

35:55.999 --> 35:56.999
BUT IF YOU TAKE MY MONEY,

35:56.999 --> 35:59.999
THEN IT'S GOING TO BE CALLED

35:56.999 --> 35:59.999
SOMETHING THAT WORKS.

35:59.999 --> 36:02.999
DON'T TRUST THE PROCESS?

35:59.999 --> 36:02.999
DON'T TAKE MY MONEY.

36:05.999 --> 36:09.999
IN ANY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS,

36:05.999 --> 36:09.999
SOMEBODY HAS TO BE THE LEADER.

36:11.999 --> 36:13.999
THAT'S JUST WHAT HAPPENS.

36:13.999 --> 36:15.999
IF WE'RE GONNA GO TO BATTLE,

36:13.999 --> 36:15.999
IT CAN'T BE LIKE,

36:15.999 --> 36:17.999
"ALL RIGHT, WHICH WAY

36:15.999 --> 36:17.999
ARE WE GOING? EVERYBODY VOTE."

36:17.999 --> 36:18.999
IT JUST DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

36:18.999 --> 36:21.999
YOU GOT TO PICK A PATH,

36:18.999 --> 36:21.999
AND YOU GOT TO GO.

36:21.999 --> 36:25.999
I THINK THAT BRANDS AND NAMES

36:21.999 --> 36:25.999
SHOULD BE CONVERSATIONAL.

36:25.999 --> 36:27.999
THEY SHOULD BE ENTERTAINING.

36:27.999 --> 36:30.999
I LIKE THE FACT THAT THE NAME

36:27.999 --> 36:30.999
"THE SIMPLE GREEK"

36:30.999 --> 36:33.999
IS A BIT FUNNY

36:30.999 --> 36:33.999
AND IT'S A BIT IRONIC

36:33.999 --> 36:37.999
AND IT'S OKAY ONCE IN A WHILE

36:33.999 --> 36:37.999
TO MAKE FUN OF YOURSELF.

36:37.999 --> 36:40.999
IT'S THE GREATEST WAY TO GET

36:37.999 --> 36:40.999
PEOPLE TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.

36:40.999 --> 36:43.999
Mike: THEY'RE ALSO GONNA

36:40.999 --> 36:43.999
REMEMBER "THE SIMPLE GREEK,"

36:43.999 --> 36:44.999
AND THERE IS AN IRONY TO IT.

36:44.999 --> 36:46.000
AND I THINK

36:44.999 --> 36:46.000
THAT WHEN YOU WALK IN

36:46.999 --> 36:47.999
AND YOU SAY,

36:46.999 --> 36:47.999
"WHAT MAKES IT SO SIMPLE?"

36:47.999 --> 36:48.999
IT'S NOT AS THOUGH

36:47.999 --> 36:48.999
THE EMPLOYEES ARE DUMB.

36:48.999 --> 36:50.999
IT'S JUST THE PROCESS

36:48.999 --> 36:50.999
IS THAT EASY.

36:50.999 --> 36:52.999
-Lemonis: RIGHT.

36:50.999 --> 36:52.999
-Sasha: WE ARE BEING SIMPLE.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.999
THE PROCESS IS SIMPLE,

36:53.000 --> 36:55.999
SO IT DOES MAKE SENSE.

36:55.999 --> 36:56.999
Kathleen: ALL RIGHT.

36:56.999 --> 36:59.999
THAT'S FINE.

36:56.999 --> 36:59.999
I WILL GO WITH IT.

36:59.999 --> 37:00.999
-Mike: GOOD.

36:59.999 --> 37:00.999
-Lemonis: OKAY.

37:00.999 --> 37:03.999
THIS IS WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.

37:00.999 --> 37:03.999
YOU GOT TO TRUST THE PROCESS.

37:15.999 --> 37:18.999
WHEN I WALK IN THE DOOR,

37:15.999 --> 37:18.999
IT FEELS LIKE A DIFFERENT PLACE.

37:18.999 --> 37:20.999
-Jace: IT REALLY DOES.

37:18.999 --> 37:20.999
-Kathleen: ABSOLUTELY.

37:20.999 --> 37:23.999
Lemonis: I AM BLOWN AWAY

37:20.999 --> 37:23.999
WITH HOW THE PLACE LOOKS.

37:23.999 --> 37:25.999
IT USED TO LOOK DARK AND DINGY,

37:25.999 --> 37:29.999
AND NOW IT'S BRIGHTER, CLEANER,

37:25.999 --> 37:29.999
AND MORE SIMPLE.

37:29.999 --> 37:31.999
WE REPLACED THE OLD LIGHTING

37:29.999 --> 37:31.999
WITH NEW FIXTURES,

37:31.999 --> 37:36.999
AND WE PUT IN RECESSED LIGHTING

37:31.999 --> 37:36.999
THAT REALLY LIGHTS UP THE PLACE.

37:36.999 --> 37:39.999
BEFORE, IT WAS A CLUTTERED,

37:36.999 --> 37:39.999
DISORGANIZED WORK SPACE.

37:39.999 --> 37:42.999
AND NOW THE NEW KITCHEN

37:39.999 --> 37:42.999
IS WAY MORE ORGANIZED

37:42.999 --> 37:44.000
AND SUPPORTS

37:42.999 --> 37:44.000
OUR ORDERING PROCESS.

37:44.999 --> 37:46.999
SO YOU TOOK THE LEAD,

37:44.999 --> 37:46.999
AND YOU DID IT.

37:46.999 --> 37:48.999
GOOD JOB.

37:48.999 --> 37:50.999
WHILE I FEEL LIKE

37:48.999 --> 37:50.999
WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK,

37:50.999 --> 37:53.999
I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

37:50.999 --> 37:53.999
US MAKING TONIGHT'S OPENING.

37:53.999 --> 37:54.999
THERE'S NO TABLES AND CHAIRS.

37:54.999 --> 37:56.999
THERE'S NO SIGNAGE ON THE WALLS.

37:56.999 --> 37:57.999
THERE'S NO FOOD PREPARED.

37:57.999 --> 37:58.999
I DON'T KNOW

37:57.999 --> 37:58.999
HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS.

37:58.999 --> 38:02.000
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

37:58.999 --> 38:02.000
IS WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER.

38:02.999 --> 38:04.999
WE'RE GONNA GET THE FURNITURE

38:02.999 --> 38:04.999
UP HERE AND READY TO GO.

38:04.999 --> 38:06.999
I WANT THIS THING TO BE OPEN

38:04.999 --> 38:06.999
BY TONIGHT.

38:10.999 --> 38:12.999
FOR BUSINESS ADVICE

38:10.999 --> 38:12.999
AND EXTRA SCENES FROM THE SHOW,

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
Lemonis: WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
IS WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER.

38:14.999 --> 38:16.999
I WANT THIS THING TO BE OPEN

38:14.999 --> 38:16.999
BY TONIGHT.

38:19.999 --> 38:21.999
Mike: SEE HOW THAT MAKES IT

38:19.999 --> 38:21.999
A LITTLE BIT BIGGER?

38:21.999 --> 38:23.999
GET ONE OF THOSE CLIPS AND MAKE

38:21.999 --> 38:23.999
SURE THEY FIT ON ALL OF THEM.

38:23.999 --> 38:24.999
YEAH, THAT HEIGHT'S GOOD

38:23.999 --> 38:24.999
RIGHT THERE.

38:26.999 --> 38:29.999
YEAH, THIS HAS TO COME DOWN,

38:26.999 --> 38:29.999
LIKE, A LITTLE BIT.

38:31.999 --> 38:35.999
THIS ONE HERE --

38:31.999 --> 38:35.999
I WOULD SCREW THIS IN FIRST.

38:35.999 --> 38:38.999
Kane: SO, IT'LL GO BASE,

38:35.999 --> 38:38.999
PROTEIN, SIDES,

38:38.999 --> 38:39.999
SAUCE AND EXTRAS,

38:38.999 --> 38:39.999
AND SWEETS AND DRINKS.

38:39.999 --> 38:40.999
Mike: CORRECT.

38:40.999 --> 38:42.999
[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]

38:51.999 --> 38:53.999
[ HORN HONKS ]

38:55.999 --> 38:57.999
Lemonis: I LOVE THE FACT

38:55.999 --> 38:57.999
THAT EVERYBODY SHOWED UP,

38:57.999 --> 38:58.999
AND THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER.

38:58.999 --> 39:00.999
IT'S LIKE ONE BIG TEAM.

39:00.999 --> 39:02.999
I THINK THE BIGGEST THING

39:02.999 --> 39:04.999
THAT I'VE SEEN

39:02.999 --> 39:04.999
IN THIS ENTIRE PROCESS

39:04.999 --> 39:07.999
IS THAT MIKE HAS BUILT A RAPPORT

39:04.999 --> 39:07.999
WITH THE FRANCHISEES.

39:07.999 --> 39:09.999
THEY HAVE RALLIED AROUND HIM,

39:09.999 --> 39:12.999
ALL HANDS ON DECK,

39:09.999 --> 39:12.999
ALL PULLING FOR THE SAME CAUSE.

39:12.999 --> 39:15.999
AND IN THE END, THAT'S THE SIGN

39:12.999 --> 39:15.999
OF A GOOD LEADER --

39:15.999 --> 39:17.999
A PERSON THAT CAN RALLY PEOPLE

39:15.999 --> 39:17.999
AROUND THEM

39:17.999 --> 39:20.999
TO COME THROUGH

39:17.999 --> 39:20.999
IN A TIME OF NEED.

39:20.999 --> 39:22.999
MA'AM, ARE YOU EATING

39:20.999 --> 39:22.999
THE PROFITS?

39:22.999 --> 39:23.999
THIS FOOD LOOKS AMAZING --

39:23.999 --> 39:28.999
FRESH, CLEAN, HOMEMADE,

39:23.999 --> 39:28.999
AUTHENTIC, SIMPLE, AND GREEK.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.999
THIS IS THE KIND OF FOOD

39:29.000 --> 39:31.999
I'M PROUD TO PUT MY NAME ON.

39:31.999 --> 39:33.999
WE KNEW

39:31.999 --> 39:33.999
THAT THE FRANCHISE SYSTEM

39:33.999 --> 39:37.999
WAS REALLY STRUGGLING

39:33.999 --> 39:37.999
ON THE COMMUNICATION SIDE.

39:37.999 --> 39:38.999
IN ANY BUSINESS,

39:37.999 --> 39:38.999
I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE

39:38.999 --> 39:40.999
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW

39:38.999 --> 39:40.999
THEIR NUMBERS.

39:40.999 --> 39:41.999
AND IN ORDER TO KNOW

39:40.999 --> 39:41.999
THEIR NUMBERS,

39:42.000 --> 39:43.999
YOU HAVE TO HAVE

39:42.000 --> 39:43.999
THE RIGHT SYSTEMS IN PLACE.

39:43.999 --> 39:46.999
I HAD AT&T COME IN,

39:43.999 --> 39:46.999
AND THEY SET EVERYTHING UP,

39:46.999 --> 39:48.999
SO ALL OF THE STORES

39:46.999 --> 39:48.999
WILL HAVE WI-FI.

39:48.999 --> 39:50.999
THEY'LL ALL HAVE

39:48.999 --> 39:50.999
A NEW P.O.S. SYSTEM,

39:50.999 --> 39:51.999
AND IT INCLUDES MOBILE PAY.

39:51.999 --> 39:53.999
SO IF YOU DO

39:51.999 --> 39:53.999
ANY STREET FESTIVALS

39:53.999 --> 39:55.999
OR GREEK FESTIVALS,

39:55.999 --> 39:56.999
IT'S HOOKED RIGHT UP

39:55.999 --> 39:56.999
TO YOUR SYSTEM.

39:56.999 --> 39:57.999
YOU CAN SWIPE AND PAY.

39:57.999 --> 39:59.999
THE THING FOR ME

39:57.999 --> 39:59.999
THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS

39:59.999 --> 40:01.999
IT'S GOT AN INVENTORY SYSTEM.

40:01.999 --> 40:05.999
IT'S REALLY ABOUT COMMUNICATING,

40:01.999 --> 40:05.999
WHICH WE WEREN'T DOING BEFORE.

40:05.999 --> 40:08.999
WHILE THEY'RE FINISHING,

40:05.999 --> 40:08.999
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS.

40:08.999 --> 40:09.999
NOW THAT WE'VE COMPLETED

40:09.999 --> 40:11.999
THE RENOVATION

40:09.999 --> 40:11.999
OF THE MT. LEBANON LOCATION,

40:11.999 --> 40:13.999
I'M CONFIDENT

40:11.999 --> 40:13.999
THAT IT'S TIME TO MOVE FORWARD

40:13.999 --> 40:14.999
ON THE OTHER LOCATIONS.

40:14.999 --> 40:16.999
OVER THE NEXT

40:14.999 --> 40:16.999
SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS,

40:16.999 --> 40:17.999
WE'LL HAVE COMPLETED

40:16.999 --> 40:17.999
ALL OF THEM,

40:17.999 --> 40:20.999
WITH THE FIRST ONE BEING

40:17.999 --> 40:20.999
MARKET SQUARE IN MID-JANUARY.

40:20.999 --> 40:22.999
THIS IS IT.

40:22.999 --> 40:26.999
SALT-AND-PEPPER-SHAKER CONTAINER

40:22.999 --> 40:26.999
LOOKS WEIRD THERE.

40:26.999 --> 40:28.999
LET ME GET RID OF THESE LADDERS.

40:28.999 --> 40:29.999
WE'RE MOMENTS AWAY

40:28.999 --> 40:29.999
FROM THE OPENING,

40:29.999 --> 40:32.999
AND IT'S IMPORTANT

40:29.999 --> 40:32.999
FOR EVERY PERSON IN THIS GROUP

40:32.999 --> 40:35.000
TO SEE HOW FAR WE'VE COME

40:32.999 --> 40:35.000
IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

40:35.999 --> 40:38.999
WHAT I WANTED TO DO

40:35.999 --> 40:38.999
BEFORE WE WENT INSIDE

40:38.999 --> 40:40.999
IS HAVE YOU GUYS

40:38.999 --> 40:40.999
LOOK THROUGH THE GLASS

40:40.999 --> 40:42.999
AND REALLY SEE YOUR FUTURE.

40:47.999 --> 40:48.999
Lemonis: JACE.

40:48.999 --> 40:50.999
-YOU DID AN AWESOME JOB.

40:48.999 --> 40:50.999
-Jace: THANK YOU.

40:50.999 --> 40:51.999

40:50.999 --> 40:51.999
MIKE, YOU PULLED IT OUT, BUDDY.

40:51.999 --> 40:53.999
Mike: THANK YOU.

40:53.999 --> 40:54.999
Lemonis: YOU DID EVERYTHING

40:53.999 --> 40:54.999
YOU NEEDED TO DO.

40:54.999 --> 40:58.999
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE

40:54.999 --> 40:58.999
OF A TEAM WORKING TOGETHER.

40:58.999 --> 40:59.999
HOW DO YOU GUYS LIKE

40:58.999 --> 40:59.999
THE WAY THE LOGO LOOKS?

40:59.999 --> 41:01.999
-Karla: I LOVE IT.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.999
-Kane: I LIKE IT.

41:01.999 --> 41:02.999
-Sasha: I LOVE IT.

41:01.999 --> 41:02.999
-Kathleen: IT LOOKS NICE,

41:02.999 --> 41:04.999
-BUT I DON'T LIKE WHAT IT SAYS.

41:02.999 --> 41:04.999
-Lemonis: OKAY.

41:04.999 --> 41:05.999
Kathleen: YOU SAID

41:04.999 --> 41:05.999
I DIDN'T HAVE TO LIKE IT.

41:05.999 --> 41:07.999
Lemonis: YOU'RE GONNA LIKE

41:05.999 --> 41:07.999
THE CHECKS THAT IT PRINTS.

41:07.999 --> 41:08.999
Kathleen: OKAY, YEAH.

41:08.999 --> 41:09.999
Kane:

41:08.999 --> 41:09.999
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

41:09.999 --> 41:11.999
Lemonis: SO, WHY DON'T WE

41:09.999 --> 41:11.999
GO INSIDE? LADIES FIRST.

41:11.999 --> 41:13.999
WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE,

41:13.999 --> 41:16.999
MY BIG FAT GREEK GYRO

41:13.999 --> 41:16.999
WAS A PRETTY BROKEN BUSINESS.

41:16.999 --> 41:17.999
IN FACT,

41:16.999 --> 41:17.999
IT WAS MORE OF A STARTUP.

41:17.999 --> 41:19.999
BUT AS WE OPEN

41:17.999 --> 41:19.999
THESE DOORS TONIGHT,

41:19.999 --> 41:21.999
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD

41:19.999 --> 41:21.999
TO THE FUTURE.

41:21.999 --> 41:23.999
COME ON IN OUT OF THE COLD.

41:26.999 --> 41:28.999
Kathleen:

41:26.999 --> 41:28.999
YOUR FIRST CUSTOMERS.

41:29.999 --> 41:32.999
DID YOU FIND THE ORDERING

41:29.999 --> 41:32.999
PROCESS TO BE KIND OF EASY?

41:32.999 --> 41:33.999
Woman: VERY NICE.

41:33.999 --> 41:34.999
Lemonis:

41:33.999 --> 41:34.999
SIMPLY JUST PICK AND GO THROUGH.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.999
THIS IS INCREDIBLE,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.999
AND THE PLACE IS HOPPING.

41:38.999 --> 41:39.999
WHAT'S REALLY EXCITING FOR ME

41:39.999 --> 41:42.999
IS TO WATCH THE FRANCHISOR AND

41:39.999 --> 41:42.999
THE FRANCHISEES WORK TOGETHER.

41:42.999 --> 41:44.999
THEY'RE TRULY ACTING

41:42.999 --> 41:44.999
LIKE A TEAM NOW.

41:44.999 --> 41:45.999
Mike:

41:44.999 --> 41:45.999
I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT

41:46.000 --> 41:47.999
AND THANK EVERYBODY

41:46.000 --> 41:47.999
FOR COMING TONIGHT --

41:47.999 --> 41:50.999
THE LAUNCH OF THE SIMPLE GREEK.

41:50.999 --> 41:53.999
I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERY

41:50.999 --> 41:53.999
FRANCHISEE INDIVIDUALLY

41:53.999 --> 41:56.999
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART

41:53.999 --> 41:56.999
FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS.

41:56.999 --> 41:58.999
I KNOW THAT CHANGE

41:56.999 --> 41:58.999
IS VERY DIFFICULT,

41:58.999 --> 42:01.999
BUT I THINK THAT THIS CHANGE

41:58.999 --> 42:01.999
IS GONNA BE WELL, WELL WORTH IT.

42:01.999 --> 42:04.999
HERE'S TO MR. LEMONIS,

42:01.999 --> 42:04.999
AND HERE'S TO THE SIMPLE GREEK.

42:04.999 --> 42:06.999
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

42:06.999 --> 42:08.999
Andreas: OPA!

42:08.999 --> 42:11.999
Lemonis: WITH THE SIMPLE GREEK

42:08.999 --> 42:11.999
MT. LEBANON LOCATION COMPLETED,

42:11.999 --> 42:13.999
I'M EXCITED TO MOVE FORWARD

42:11.999 --> 42:13.999
ON TO THE OTHER LOCATIONS

42:13.999 --> 42:15.999
AND CONTINUE THIS

42:13.999 --> 42:15.999
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

42:15.999 --> 42:18.999
WHAT I FEEL BEST ABOUT IS

42:15.999 --> 42:18.999
I NOW BELIEVE IN THE PRODUCT

42:18.999 --> 42:20.999
AND THE PROCESS.

42:20.999 --> 42:22.999
BUT I ESPECIALLY BELIEVE

42:20.999 --> 42:22.999
IN THE PEOPLE.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.999
THE FUTURE OF THE SIMPLE GREEK

42:22.999 --> 42:25.999
NOT ONLY LOOKS BRIGHT,

42:25.999 --> 42:27.999
BUT IT LOOKS VERY PROFITABLE.

42:27.999 --> 42:29.999
All: OPA!

42:29.999 --> 42:32.999
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
