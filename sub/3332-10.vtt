00:00.001 --> 00:00.429
Latin lover narrator:
Is this thing on? Okay, good.
(thumping)

00:00.001 --> 00:04.770
<i>Hi, friends. Let's jump</i>
<i>right in. As you know, jane was</i>

00:04.772 --> 00:08.040
<i>Accidentally inseminated</i>
<i>with rafael's sperm.</i>

00:08.042 --> 00:09.541
But I've never had sex.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.643
<i>And, wow, a lot</i>
<i>has happened since then.</i>

00:11.645 --> 00:13.245
<i>First, jane and rafael</i>
<i>discovered the truth</i>

00:13.247 --> 00:15.481
<i>About his ex-wife</i>
<i>petra's identity.</i>

00:15.483 --> 00:17.549
She's not who she says she is.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.685
Natalia.
Jane: <i>Turns out the real petra,</i>

00:19.687 --> 00:22.388
Well, she died
in the czech republic in 2008.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.423
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Meanwhile, tensions between</i>
<i>jane's ex-fiancÃ© michael</i>

00:24.425 --> 00:26.692
<i>And her current flame</i>
<i>rafael were at</i>

00:26.694 --> 00:29.194
<i>An all-time high, and jane</i>
<i>was caught in the middle.</i>

00:29.196 --> 00:31.430
Something's going on
with him-- something shady.

00:31.432 --> 00:32.731
Latin lover narrator:
<i>See, michael was convinced</i>

00:32.733 --> 00:34.533
<i>Rafael was involved</i>
<i>with sin rostro,</i>

00:34.535 --> 00:36.035
<i>A big, bad drug dealer.</i>

00:36.037 --> 00:38.437
<i>He thought he had a lead,</i>
<i>but it evaporated.</i>

00:38.439 --> 00:40.172
We lost a serbian
war criminal.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.341
Listen, I have a theory.
Sin rostro went underground

00:42.343 --> 00:43.809
Around the same time
rafael got cancer.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.245
As soon as rafael's better
and takes over the hotel,

00:46.247 --> 00:49.448
Sin rostro resurfaces
and there are two murders.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.116
Where's your evidence?
Latin lover narrator:
<i>So he broke into</i>

00:51.118 --> 00:53.052
<i>Rafael's office,</i>
<i>where he found this.</i>

00:53.054 --> 00:55.387
<i>Unfortunately, when he</i>
<i>went back, with a warrant,</i>

00:55.389 --> 00:57.689
<i>The safe was empty.</i>
<i>And then this happened.</i>

00:57.691 --> 01:00.359
<i>It was an omg moment, right?</i>

01:00.361 --> 01:02.094
<i>And to make matters worse,</i>

01:02.096 --> 01:05.431
<i>A tropical storm</i>
<i>is heading their way.</i>

01:05.433 --> 01:08.434
<i>It should be noted</i>
<i>that at an early age,</i>

01:08.436 --> 01:10.636
<i>Jane gloriana villanueva</i>
<i>was already</i>

01:10.638 --> 01:12.438
<i>A quick learner</i>
<i>with many skills.</i>

01:12.440 --> 01:13.839
100 in math,

01:13.841 --> 01:17.342
100 in social studies,
98 in spelling,

01:17.344 --> 01:19.344
But that's because
I used the british spelling

01:19.346 --> 01:22.614
Of "amphitheater," so I think
I can argue that tomorrow.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.217
Xiomara: Great job, hon.
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted that</i>

01:25.219 --> 01:26.852
<i>Xiomara gloriana villanueva</i>
<i>was also</i>

01:26.854 --> 01:30.155
<i>A very quick learner</i>
<i>with many skills.</i>

01:31.357 --> 01:33.659
<i>Unfortunately, cooking</i>
<i>was not one of them.</i>

01:33.661 --> 01:35.194
Thank you.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.362
"ask your parent

01:37.364 --> 01:39.631
To cook a dish
from the country you're from."

01:39.633 --> 01:42.234
Hey, honey, why didn't you
tell me about this?

01:42.236 --> 01:45.370
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Because she was going to ask</i>
<i>alba to cook for heritage day.</i>

01:45.372 --> 01:46.872
I forgot.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.740
It'll be fun.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.210
Maybe I'll make, like,
a chicken empanada or an arepa?

01:51.212 --> 01:52.878
(gasps)
young jane: <i>Abuela?</i>

01:52.880 --> 01:55.380
Can you teach me how to pray?

01:55.382 --> 01:57.282
Like, the right way,
with your rosary?

02:09.129 --> 02:11.897
I just want heritage day
to go well.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.732
Mom's cooking,

02:13.734 --> 02:16.335
And I don't want anyone
to get seriously sick.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.150
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And from that moment on,</i>

02:31.152 --> 02:33.318
<i>When jane felt</i>
<i>especially desperate,</i>

02:33.320 --> 02:36.321
<i>She would often</i>
<i>turn to prayer.</i>

02:36.323 --> 02:37.823
(thunder rumbling)

02:37.825 --> 02:40.759
<i>And jane needed</i>
<i>the power of prayer now</i>

02:40.761 --> 02:43.295
<i>More than ever.</i>

02:43.297 --> 02:45.297
(mouthing)

02:45.299 --> 02:46.198
Hi, ms. Villanueva?

02:46.200 --> 02:48.500
Yes.
Yes.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.202
She's my mother,
her grandma.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.703
What's going on?
How is she?

02:51.705 --> 02:53.805
Well, the good news
is she's stable.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.241
And she gives every indication
that she will wake up.

02:56.243 --> 02:58.243
Okay, so what's
the bad news?

02:58.245 --> 02:59.878
We don't know when that will be.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.514
There was some
internal bleeding caused by

03:02.516 --> 03:04.683
The head injury.
And until she does wake up,

03:04.685 --> 03:06.285
We won't know whether
there will be

03:06.287 --> 03:08.287
Any long-term
ramifications.

03:08.289 --> 03:11.423
Like, you mean
her memory? Or...

03:11.425 --> 03:13.225
That, among
other things--

03:13.227 --> 03:14.760
Speech, certain skills.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.764
All we can do is wait.

03:18.766 --> 03:21.366
Okay. Thank you.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.435
Thanks.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.311
She would want
us to pray.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.278
What?

03:33.280 --> 03:35.447
Abuela.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.217
Where's her rosary?

03:38.219 --> 03:39.551
I don't know.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.320
No, I saw her put it
in her purse

03:41.322 --> 03:42.821
Before we went
to the awards show.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.323
It must've fallen out
when she fell.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.391
Okay, I'm gonna
go to the hotel to get it.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.626
Come on, jane.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.394
There's a tropical storm
outside.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.330
Mom, do you remember
when I was applying

03:51.332 --> 03:53.432
To get my teaching degree
and she prayed with the rosary

03:53.434 --> 03:54.566
That I'd get in?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.235
Two days later, I got in.

03:56.237 --> 03:57.736
Because you're smart,
not because of some beads

03:57.738 --> 03:59.304
She got at a church flea market.

04:01.341 --> 04:03.308
Mom, I can't just
sit around and do nothing.

04:04.477 --> 04:05.811
Okay? I'll take the car--

04:05.813 --> 04:07.412
Ten minutes there,
ten minutes back.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.480
Please?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.818
Okay, let me know
if anything changes.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.886
(thunderclap)

04:21.661 --> 04:23.562
Latin lover narrator:
<i>You'll recall we last</i>
<i>left michael and nadine</i>

04:23.564 --> 04:26.531
<i>In a rather exciting position.</i>

04:26.533 --> 04:28.600
<i>Not that one, you perv.</i>

04:28.602 --> 04:30.902
<i>They had discovered</i>
<i>sin rostro's</i>

04:30.904 --> 04:32.938
<i>Secret tunnel</i>
<i>beneath the hotel.</i>

04:39.345 --> 04:41.346
You sure we shouldn't
call for backup?

04:41.348 --> 04:43.415
The serbian could
still be down here.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.484
We don't even know where
this tunnel leads.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.520
Hold up.
(whispers): Whoa.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.289
It's a retinal scanner.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.057
This must be where
sin rostro keeps the drugs.

04:52.059 --> 04:55.060
We got to get inside.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.396
Agreed.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.463
Let's call for backup

04:58.465 --> 05:00.932
And bust through this thing.

05:00.934 --> 05:04.770
Lachlan is stuck
in key largo.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.338
Oh, that's too bad.
Yes, it is,

05:06.340 --> 05:07.873
Because I have to head out.

05:07.875 --> 05:08.874
The storm's really
picking up, darling.

05:08.876 --> 05:09.941
Maybe you shouldn't fly.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.777
I have to; it's-it's important.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.345
Then don't worry.

05:13.347 --> 05:16.381
I can handle the marbella
in your absence.

05:16.383 --> 05:17.849
Come on, dad.
I've done it before.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.619
And your tenure
wasn't that successful.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.020
And I've learned
from my mistakes.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.323
Come on, you have
proven your point.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.791
Just give me a chance.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.092
There's a lot
to do right now.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.795
The storm is picking up.
We got to prepare the hotel,

05:29.797 --> 05:31.897
We have to relocate patients
from their recovery suites

05:31.899 --> 05:33.932
To hospital in case
our generators fail.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.969
Just let me get started.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.371
Please.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.039
All right.

05:43.710 --> 05:46.345
One thing.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.680
Lachlan was about to institute

05:48.682 --> 05:50.816
15% layoffs
across all departments

05:50.818 --> 05:52.084
To offset our losses.

05:52.086 --> 05:54.353
Now you can do it.

05:54.355 --> 05:56.355
It's only fair,

05:56.357 --> 05:58.523
Since it was
your mistakes that put us

05:58.525 --> 06:00.592
In this spot
in the first place.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.528
Will that be a problem?

06:05.064 --> 06:07.132
No. Not at all.

06:12.672 --> 06:15.140
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted that,</i>

06:15.142 --> 06:16.775
<i>Despite the unpleasant task,</i>

06:16.777 --> 06:20.379
<i>Rafael found himself</i>
<i>briefly optimistic.</i>

06:20.381 --> 06:21.847
Hello, rafael.
Latin lover narrator: <i>Yup.</i>

06:21.849 --> 06:23.849
<i>Briefly.</i>

06:23.851 --> 06:25.617
What do you want, petra?

06:25.619 --> 06:27.986
Or... Whatever your name is.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.421
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Natalia, actually.</i>

06:29.423 --> 06:33.024
Look, I didn't
come here to fight.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.029
The divorce papers.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.632
I signed them.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.534
You won.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.603
And I'll leave as soon
as you pay out my prenup.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.838
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes, her prenup.</i>

06:46.840 --> 06:48.173
<i>Petra's golden ticket.</i>

06:48.175 --> 06:51.543
Here's the thing
about the prenup.

06:51.545 --> 06:54.146
Petra andel signed it.

06:54.148 --> 06:55.714
You're not petra andel.

06:55.716 --> 06:59.050
Rafael, please.
I have nothing.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.520
And you deserve nothing.
Yes, I know.
You're right.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.455
Let me at least tell you
the truth about everything.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.692
I lied about my identity

07:07.694 --> 07:10.429
Because I've been running
for a very long time

07:10.431 --> 07:12.931
From a very evil man.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.934
Yeah, so here's the problem.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.571
I don't believe you.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.072
It's the truth.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.208
Should we go over
all the crazy lies

07:23.210 --> 07:25.977
And the things you've done
just in the last six months?

07:25.979 --> 07:27.546
'cause we can.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.114
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ooh, yes, let's.</i>

07:33.219 --> 07:35.487
Rafael, listen...

07:35.489 --> 07:38.156
Man (over p.A.):
Attention guests and staff.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.826
Tropical storm florentina
has gained speed and is now

07:40.828 --> 07:42.894
A category 2 hurricane.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.730
Authorities tell us
the roads will soon be closed.

07:45.732 --> 07:48.533
For your own safety,
please stay indoors.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.836
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Uh-oh. Jane still hadn't</i>
<i>found alba's rosary.</i>

07:50.838 --> 07:53.238
Jane?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.507
I found this
when I was cleaning up.

07:55.509 --> 07:56.908
I heard you were
looking for it.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.577
<i>It felt like a miracle.</i>

07:58.579 --> 08:01.813
Oh, my god. Thank you, regina.
I owe you big-time.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.582
Hey, you taught my gaby
how to make the best

08:03.584 --> 08:04.916
Grilled cheese
on the planet.

08:04.918 --> 08:08.520
It's the least I could do.
(chuckles)

08:08.522 --> 08:10.622
(thunder rumbling)

08:10.624 --> 08:12.924
Please stay off the roads
and in your homes.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.260
The national weather service
has upgraded this...

08:15.262 --> 08:19.498
Wow! I have to say, the wind
is really picking up out here!

08:21.634 --> 08:24.669
Emilio: I told you,
I have no choice.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.171
I'm getting out
before the storm hits.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.106
The move is next week.

08:28.108 --> 08:31.510
I'll need five
million for allegria.

08:34.213 --> 08:36.882
Darling. I didn't
know you were awake.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.518
Oh, I couldn't sleep,
with the wind.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.620
You sounded upset.
Is everything all right?

08:41.622 --> 08:44.789
Yes, yes. It's my driver, he's
just waiting for me downstairs.

08:44.791 --> 08:47.592
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ooh. That didn't sound</i>
<i>like his driver.</i>

08:47.594 --> 08:49.194
Do you really
have to go tonight?

08:49.196 --> 08:51.630
Yes, I do. But I'm gonna call
you as soon as I get to prague.

08:51.632 --> 08:55.634
And next week, you and me,
we're going away together.

09:01.641 --> 09:03.975
So you two found this

09:03.977 --> 09:06.845
Hydraulic bathtub...

09:06.847 --> 09:08.547
How, exactly?

09:12.118 --> 09:15.287
Just good old-fashioned
detective work.

09:15.289 --> 09:17.556
Well, great job.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.024
Thank you.
(phone ringing)

09:20.326 --> 09:23.028
Hey.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.329
Okay, we're on our way.

09:24.331 --> 09:27.065
They got through
the lock.

09:38.611 --> 09:41.346
What the hell?

09:41.348 --> 09:44.182
Maybe sin rostro

09:44.184 --> 09:46.651
Kills people here
from rival cartels.

09:48.354 --> 09:50.722
Looks more like a...

09:50.724 --> 09:53.592
Surgical room.

09:53.594 --> 09:56.294
Yeah, but why the hell does
sin rostro need a surgical room?

09:57.897 --> 10:00.699
Make sure all the outdoor
furniture is moved inside.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.367
The wind will toss everything.
And get those storm shutters up,

10:02.369 --> 10:03.735
And remember,
first sign of flooding,

10:03.737 --> 10:06.171
We kill the main breaker.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.906
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

10:07.908 --> 10:10.008
I thought you were
at the hospital.
No, no, I...

10:10.010 --> 10:12.010
I came to grab my grandmother's
rosary. I have to get back.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.912
No, the roads are really bad.
No, but it's close.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.947
You are pregnant.
If something were to happen...

10:21.721 --> 10:23.622
Hey, make an announcement.
It's no longer safe for anyone

10:23.624 --> 10:25.357
To leave the hotel.
The marbella is now on lockdown.

10:32.164 --> 10:34.299
I know you want to go,
but it's not safe, okay?

10:34.301 --> 10:37.102
Not until the road clears.
No, you're right.
I'm gonna call my mom.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.804
I-I got to go talk to them.
Do you want to wait out
the storm in my penthouse?

10:39.806 --> 10:42.140
No, no, no. I'm gonna find
my friends, see how I can
help. Go. I'll figure it out.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.276
Go, go, go, go.
Just-just text me
if you need anything.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.645
Okay.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.146
Okay, so this room

10:48.148 --> 10:50.248
Is also connected to the hotel's
medical recovery suites.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.416
There were
five patients

10:51.418 --> 10:53.385
Registered there
as of this afternoon.

10:53.387 --> 10:56.087
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted</i>
<i>that michael and nadine</i>

10:56.089 --> 10:58.289
<i>Are thinking</i>
<i>the same exact thing.</i>

10:58.291 --> 11:00.825
Where are the patients?

11:00.827 --> 11:02.394
They were relocated
to holy crown hospital

11:02.396 --> 11:04.029
Before the hurricane hit.
What?

11:04.031 --> 11:06.264
Apparently, the guy
that runs the hotel

11:06.266 --> 11:07.265
Did it as a precaution.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.333
Rafael solano?

11:08.335 --> 11:09.768
Yeah.
Head over to
holy crown.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.369
I don't care if those
roads are closed.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.705
We need those patients
identified immediately.

11:13.707 --> 11:14.939
Got it.

11:14.941 --> 11:17.342
It's rafael. I knew it.
Okay, just calm down

11:17.344 --> 11:19.177
And let's think this through.
He ran this hotel.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.046
He knows everything
that happens here.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.048
There's no way he didn't know
about this place.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.916
Nadine,
think about it.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.918
Roman zazo,
one of sin rostro's contacts,

11:26.920 --> 11:28.887
Was rafael's college roommate.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.256
Then there's the
multiple passports
from different countries,

11:31.258 --> 11:33.191
Cash and burner phone
inside his safe...

11:33.193 --> 11:34.359
Which we never found.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.960
I know what I saw.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.295
You know me
well enough to know

11:37.297 --> 11:38.697
I would not make that up.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.065
He must have moved them.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.900
Look, rafael is definitely
a suspect, okay?

11:41.902 --> 11:43.368
But if he's involved,
I got to think

11:43.370 --> 11:45.270
He's working for his father.
I mean,

11:45.272 --> 11:46.905
Emilio is the one
that financed the hotel.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.440
And zazo was murdered
the same night

11:48.442 --> 11:50.041
That emilio got here.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.276
Either way,
rafael's involved.

11:51.278 --> 11:54.279
I bet the retinal scanner
recognizes him.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.281
The tech had to break the
scanner to get through the door.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.348
(sighs)

11:57.350 --> 12:00.852
Then I'm gonna
go rattle his cage.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.487
(thunderclap)

12:02.489 --> 12:04.856
Okay, I've seen <i>titanic,</i>
<i>like, a hundred times.</i>

12:04.858 --> 12:07.726
Nobody cares about
the third-class passengers.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.194
We're gonna get locked
in here and drown.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.729
Okay, you do know we're
not actually on a boat,

12:10.731 --> 12:12.397
Right?
Guys.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.033
What's wrong? Oh, my god,
I knew it. I had a bad feeling.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.035
I just heard from housekeeping
carla, who's dating that bellboy

12:17.037 --> 12:20.305
Whose sister works in hr,
that people are getting fired.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.207
Like, a lot
of people.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.341
(thunderclap)
(gasps)

12:23.343 --> 12:25.343
During a hurricane?!

12:25.345 --> 12:26.978
Oh! Jane, jane,
jane, come here.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.379
Jane: Sorry, I was
just changing.

12:28.381 --> 12:29.481
I've been looking for you guys.

12:29.483 --> 12:31.149
Frankie heard
cuts are coming.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.917
Will you ask rafael
if it's true

12:32.919 --> 12:34.352
And who's getting fired?

12:34.354 --> 12:36.020
Oh, I-I don't think
that's a good idea.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.022
Oh, please, jane?
I need this job.

12:38.024 --> 12:40.525
I drink for free,
and it's so close to my gym.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.094
Yeah, I don't think I can use
that argument with rafael.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.430
Why?
I-I don't want to take advantage
of our relationship.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.498
Luca:
Come on, jane.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.032
I just moved into a new place.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.334
If I can't pay rent,
I will literally

12:49.336 --> 12:50.769
Be homeless.
You guys, it's fine.

12:50.771 --> 12:51.770
Don't pressure her.

12:51.772 --> 12:54.105
We just need
a heads up.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.941
Okay. All right.
I'll talk to him.

12:56.943 --> 13:00.345
But he's been busy, so I-I'll
just wait till I see him later.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.514
Okay, well, he's over there
talking to your ex-fiancÃ©,

13:02.516 --> 13:04.783
Right there.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.484
I told you, I don't know
anything about secret tunnels

13:06.486 --> 13:08.486
And I want to see them.
And I told you
I don't believe you.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.488
And you can't see them--
it's a potential crime scene.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.857
Hey. Hey there.
What are you guys talking about?

13:12.859 --> 13:16.528
Uh, we're actually discussing
police business.

13:16.530 --> 13:17.962
I assume you don't
want her to stay.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.430
She can absolutely stay.

13:19.432 --> 13:22.300
Okay, so what am I
staying for exactly?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.469
We discovered a secret tunnel
underneath the marbella.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.104
It leads to
a surgical room,

13:26.106 --> 13:27.839
Connecting to
the recovery suites,

13:27.841 --> 13:31.376
Which we believe is connected
to a criminal enterprise.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.478
What kind
of criminal enterprise?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.113
There's a big drug dealer.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.382
He's known as sin rostro.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.552
The man without a face?
Yes.

13:40.554 --> 13:42.587
No one's I.D.'d him,
but we have reason to believe

13:42.589 --> 13:44.522
He's based here;
the most obvious reason being

13:44.524 --> 13:46.457
That two of his known
associates were murdered

13:46.459 --> 13:48.326
In the marbella.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.961
Exactly.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.196
The police
should have solved it.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.463
Do your job.

13:52.465 --> 13:53.498
I am.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.499
Right now.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.000
For the record,
you're claiming

13:56.002 --> 13:58.069
You have no connection
to any of this?

13:58.071 --> 14:01.072
For the record? Of course not.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.975
Latin lover narrator:
<i>For the record, michael</i>
<i>is really enjoying this.</i>

14:03.977 --> 14:05.543
Just like those passports
and the burner phone

14:05.545 --> 14:07.879
Weren't inside your safe?

14:07.881 --> 14:10.114
Listen, I've already told
you everything I know,

14:10.116 --> 14:13.151
And this is all
very upsetting.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.286
And now I'm gonna have
to hire my own security firm

14:15.288 --> 14:17.055
Until you figure out
how to catch this guy.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.623
Jane.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.125
Excuse me, detective.

14:24.630 --> 14:27.265
What was all that about?

14:27.267 --> 14:29.934
That was your ex-fiancÃ©
trying to make me look bad.

14:29.936 --> 14:31.870
Petra:
<i>Mother, enough.</i>

14:31.872 --> 14:33.872
Look, it's bad enough
my whole life is falling apart.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.174
You don't have to ride me
every second of the day, okay?

14:36.176 --> 14:38.576
(sighs)
look, we have to move on.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.178
And I have a plan.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.180
Oh. I'm all ears.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.649
I'll sell my wedding ring,
the rest of my jewelry.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.018
I'll be able to afford
a little place, a one-bedroom.

14:47.020 --> 14:50.088
Oh, yeah. Well,
what about him?

14:50.090 --> 14:51.656
(thunder rumbling)

14:53.592 --> 14:56.661
Look, h-how about we let
the bygones be bygones?

14:56.663 --> 14:59.097
You all have been
very nice to me.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.598
You could let me go.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.268
I will not tell milos.
I promise.

15:03.270 --> 15:06.237
Would make things easier.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.007
Petra, don't be idiot.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.508
We'd need two-bedroom.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.947
Wait, what? I can't hear you.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.683
I know.
The reception is spotty.

15:18.685 --> 15:19.684
How's grandma?

15:20.619 --> 15:22.353
The same.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.689
I'm just sitting here

15:24.691 --> 15:27.091
With a big pile of forms
that I wish you could fill out.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.093
I know. I'll be there
as soon as I can.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.562
Yeah, because...
(thunder rumbling)

15:31.564 --> 15:34.132
Damn it.

15:34.134 --> 15:37.335
Woman:
El presidente.

15:39.705 --> 15:42.707
How did you even get here
with the storm?

15:42.709 --> 15:45.143
I pulled some strings.
I got a police escort.

15:47.579 --> 15:50.214
(sobs)

15:50.216 --> 15:52.150
What's that?

15:52.152 --> 15:54.218
Oh. It's a swag bag.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.558
From the after-after party.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.162
I'm so glad you're here.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.164
Of course I'm here.

16:06.166 --> 16:09.600
We're family,
and nothing is more important.

16:13.505 --> 16:15.707
I'm sorry.
So many designer gifts.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.675
It's hard to find
what you're looking for.

16:19.745 --> 16:22.213
(sniffles)

16:25.751 --> 16:27.251
Oh, no. What's wrong?

16:27.253 --> 16:29.187
We're all getting fired.
That's it, isn't it?

16:29.189 --> 16:30.755
You can tell us
the truth.

16:30.757 --> 16:34.492
<i>Jane had completely forgotten</i>
<i>about the layoffs.</i>

16:34.494 --> 16:35.493
I totally flaked.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.728
I'm sorry.

16:36.730 --> 16:38.663
There's a lot going on.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.332
<i>Jane was about to tell them</i>
<i>about her grandmother.</i>

16:41.334 --> 16:43.334
Right.
<i>But then lina did that.</i>

16:43.336 --> 16:45.570
Did you just roll your eyes
at me, dude?

16:45.572 --> 16:48.573
It just seems like maybe
you're not in a big rush

16:48.575 --> 16:50.575
To find out if we're getting
fired because obviously

16:50.577 --> 16:51.743
You're not getting fired.

16:51.745 --> 16:54.379
Wait, what does that mean?
I could be.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.748
Really? Your boyfriend's
gonna fire you?

16:56.750 --> 16:59.283
You know, probably not.

16:59.285 --> 17:02.787
But that's because I've taken
three sick days in four years,

17:02.789 --> 17:05.490
And I've been twice voted
employee of the month.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.658
You keep telling yourself that.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.795
Look,
all lina's saying

17:10.797 --> 17:13.798
Is... You're in a slightly
different situation now.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.300
You've got a rich dad suddenly
and a rich baby daddy.

17:16.302 --> 17:18.536
We just don't have

17:18.538 --> 17:19.804
The same kind of safety net.

17:23.142 --> 17:24.742
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.413
Thank you.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.149
Bad time?

17:31.151 --> 17:32.683
No, come in.

17:32.685 --> 17:35.053
I was just getting an update
from our maintenance department.

17:35.055 --> 17:38.489
(thunder rumbling)

17:38.491 --> 17:40.458
Is everything okay?

17:40.460 --> 17:41.759
Yeah.

17:41.761 --> 17:45.696
It's just, uh...
My friends heard

17:45.698 --> 17:47.832
That there are gonna be layoffs,
and they're freaking out.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.068
And I hate to ask this,
but is it true?

17:50.070 --> 17:52.503
Yes.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.505
Unfortunately.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.507
My dad wants to...

17:56.509 --> 17:59.510
Institute a 15% cut
across the board.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.380
So I've just been up here
trying to make a list.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.782
Latin lover narrator:
<i>A list which jane</i>
<i>absolutely did not want to see.</i>

18:04.784 --> 18:06.417
Can I see it?

18:06.419 --> 18:09.654
You really think
that's... Appropriate?

18:09.656 --> 18:10.755
Probably not.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.323
<i>Yes. Good answer, jane.</i>

18:12.325 --> 18:14.759
But I feel like I have to
because of my friends.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.661
<i>Oy.</i>

18:18.630 --> 18:20.298
Okay.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.568
If it's that important to you.

18:46.325 --> 18:47.425
Ms. Villanueva,

18:47.427 --> 18:48.893
There's no easy way to say this.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.328
Oh, no.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.762
Did the test results...
No, no.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.598
Her condition remains unchanged.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.534
Look, the hospital's
cracking down...
On what?

18:56.536 --> 18:58.536
Your mother
is in this country illegally.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.371
She has no insurance.

19:00.373 --> 19:03.174
And the hospital cannot afford
to absorb the cost of her care.

19:03.176 --> 19:04.842
I-I don't understand.
What does that mean?

19:04.844 --> 19:08.880
That when the hurricane lifts,
we will have to notify ice,

19:08.882 --> 19:11.182
And they will deport her
to venezuela,

19:11.184 --> 19:13.818
Where she can continue
to receive care if she needs.

19:15.187 --> 19:17.655
What? That can't be legal.

19:22.628 --> 19:24.462
It's called
medical repatriation.

19:26.431 --> 19:28.432
Frankie:
<i>No.</i>

19:28.434 --> 19:30.434
I can't lose this job.
I don't have anything saved.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.270
Can't you ask rafael
to not fire me?

19:32.272 --> 19:34.305
Frankie, I...

19:34.307 --> 19:38.876
When you were tired and
needed someone to cover
those shifts, I did it.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.212
And you know I hate this. I
fought for you to get this job.

19:41.214 --> 19:44.815
You did. But now you can't even
fight to help me keep it?

19:44.817 --> 19:47.485
It's not my place.

19:49.454 --> 19:52.356
Wow. You have changed.

19:57.963 --> 20:01.232
Latin lover narrator:
<i>The truth is, jane didn't know</i>
<i>quite what to do.</i>

20:01.234 --> 20:03.801
<i>But she figured she could talk</i>
<i>to rafael about it,</i>

20:03.803 --> 20:05.903
<i>To clear her conscience</i>
<i>and get back to normal.</i>

20:05.905 --> 20:07.905
Hold the elevator!

20:07.907 --> 20:09.674
Okay.

20:14.613 --> 20:16.681
Hey.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.451
Are you following me?

20:20.453 --> 20:22.853
I am in the middle
of an investigation, jane.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.590
(clears throat)
and, yes, I am following you.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.491
But only because I'm worried.
Something bad's

20:27.493 --> 20:29.860
Going on here, and it has
to be connected to rafael.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.362
Michael, what
are you doing?
I saw the passports and phone

20:31.364 --> 20:33.598
Inside his safe myself.
Stop. Can you just stop?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.233
(loud clang)

20:35.235 --> 20:36.500
What was that?
<i>That, my dear,</i>

20:36.502 --> 20:38.002
Is the classic telenovela trope

20:38.004 --> 20:41.339
<i>Known as the "stuck</i>
<i>in the elevator" scenario,</i>

20:41.341 --> 20:44.275
In which two characters at odds
<i>are... Stuck in an elevator.</i>

20:44.277 --> 20:45.676
Seriously?

20:45.678 --> 20:46.944
What?

20:46.946 --> 20:48.479
I did not do this.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.314
This cannot be happening
right now.

20:50.316 --> 20:52.383
<i>Oh, it's happening.</i>

20:52.385 --> 20:54.885
(groans)
<i>in the dark.</i>

20:58.924 --> 21:00.925
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Please note, michael was</i>
<i>usually very good</i>

21:00.927 --> 21:03.261
<i>At breaking the tension</i>
<i>in awkward situations.</i>

21:03.263 --> 21:06.430
So, does this qualify as
mood lighting? (chuckles)

21:06.432 --> 21:07.665
<i>I said "usually."</i>

21:07.667 --> 21:09.567
Nope.

21:11.336 --> 21:12.670
(groans)

21:12.672 --> 21:14.772
Well, I radioed nadine.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.340
She's letting
maintenance know.

21:19.378 --> 21:20.811
Woman (over radio):
...Rapid development

21:20.813 --> 21:22.346
Of a mid-city
apartment building fire...

21:22.348 --> 21:24.649
Wow. Impressed you even
made it up that hill.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.651
(thunder rumbling)
I'm here to see luisa alver.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.719
I'm her stepmother.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.388
Latin lover narrator:
<i>That's one way to put it.</i>

21:30.390 --> 21:31.656
(thunderclap)

21:31.658 --> 21:34.492
...Of north baird street
and business loop 269.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.627
Residents of the 12-story
grayson apartment building...

21:36.629 --> 21:39.397
We have a visitor here
for luisa.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.565
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>It's been a while.</i>

21:41.567 --> 21:43.534
<i>I should stop</i>
<i>and catch you up on luisa.</i>

21:43.536 --> 21:45.936
<i>Surprisingly, luisa had</i>
<i>actually been enjoying her time</i>

21:45.938 --> 21:48.005
<i>In the mental hospital.</i>

21:48.007 --> 21:51.709
<i>She got three balanced meals</i>
<i>a day, plus dessert.</i>

21:51.711 --> 21:56.681
She thrived under the stability
<i>of a regular routine.</i>

21:56.683 --> 22:00.484
<i>And best of all, her roommate</i>
<i>was a really great listener.</i>

22:00.486 --> 22:02.386
And then my shaman was like,

22:02.388 --> 22:05.890
"you're finally seeing the
world through your third eye."

22:05.892 --> 22:07.958
(thunder rumbling)

22:13.031 --> 22:15.099
Luisa. Hi.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.768
What are you doing here?

22:17.770 --> 22:19.570
(whispers):
It's rose.

22:20.739 --> 22:22.506
I need to see you.

22:22.508 --> 22:25.476
I feel so terribly
about what happened.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.512
What I did.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.815
Latin lover narrator:
<i>That was true.</i>

22:30.817 --> 22:32.883
<i>Rose did feel terrible</i>
<i>about what happened.</i>

22:32.885 --> 22:36.721
<i>It was not, however,</i>
<i>the real reason she came.</i>

22:36.723 --> 22:38.089
Look, you were
threatening to tell

22:38.091 --> 22:40.991
About our affair,
and I panicked.

22:40.993 --> 22:45.062
I just panicked,
and I feel... So ashamed.

22:45.064 --> 22:47.865
I mean, I'm an adult,
and it's 2015,

22:47.867 --> 22:51.068
And I'm not ready to admit
that I want to be with a woman.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.037
That I want to be with you.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.676
I just have such a nice life
with your father.

22:58.678 --> 23:01.112
Good.

23:01.114 --> 23:03.013
Go back to it.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.916
Luisa, please. I... I haven't
been able to sleep.

23:05.918 --> 23:08.085
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:08.087 --> 23:11.389
I'm in a mental institution.

23:11.391 --> 23:12.790
Do you realize what your father

23:12.792 --> 23:14.692
Would put us through
if he found out?

23:14.694 --> 23:16.093
You could have
broken up with me.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.661
You didn't have to commit me!

23:17.663 --> 23:18.863
Luisa, please...
Get out of here!

23:20.031 --> 23:21.665
Now!

23:25.937 --> 23:28.706
(thunder rumbling)

23:39.918 --> 23:42.486
Magda:
Petra?

23:42.488 --> 23:45.656
Are you back yet
with the t.P.?

23:48.059 --> 23:49.894
Jane:
Rafael must know

23:49.896 --> 23:52.897
That the elevators
are stuck.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.465
He'll send someone.

23:54.467 --> 23:57.001
Right. Nothing ever happens
in this hotel

23:57.003 --> 23:58.836
Without rafael
knowing about it.

23:58.838 --> 24:01.172
Stop.
The tunnels,
the murders.

24:01.174 --> 24:03.007
Please, stop, please!

24:03.009 --> 24:05.543
I'm just done.

24:05.545 --> 24:07.011
Between my friends
and my grandma

24:07.013 --> 24:08.846
Unconscious in
the hospital...

24:08.848 --> 24:10.748
What?

24:10.750 --> 24:12.883
Yeah. She fell.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.985
Is it bad?

24:14.987 --> 24:17.755
They say she may wake up,
but they don't know...

24:17.757 --> 24:19.924
If she'll have
permanent damage.

24:20.692 --> 24:22.760
I am so sorry.

24:25.197 --> 24:27.832
Is, um...Is your mom...
Is your mom with her?

24:27.834 --> 24:31.001
But the last time I talked
to them, I lost reception,

24:31.003 --> 24:34.071
And I haven't heard
from them in a while.

24:34.073 --> 24:36.640
Um, there's a cop
in the hospital.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.709
I'll see if I can
reach him on the radio

24:38.711 --> 24:39.944
And get your mom
on the line.

24:39.946 --> 24:40.945
(static crackles)
really?

24:40.947 --> 24:43.481
Thank you.

24:43.483 --> 24:44.915
She hasn't even
opened her eyes yet,

24:44.917 --> 24:46.484
And they want
to deport her?

24:46.486 --> 24:47.785
I mean, how can
they do this?

24:47.787 --> 24:50.621
Xiomara, I will figure this out.
If my fame and money

24:50.623 --> 24:52.756
Cannot help keep
your mother in this country,

24:52.758 --> 24:54.158
Then what is it all for?

24:55.760 --> 24:59.196
Back off, buddy! You're not
taking my mother anywhere!

24:59.198 --> 25:01.932
You have a call.
Push to talk.

25:03.869 --> 25:05.803
Hello?

25:05.805 --> 25:07.137
Mom, it's me.

25:07.139 --> 25:08.706
(sighs)

25:08.708 --> 25:09.974
How is she?

25:09.976 --> 25:13.177
Physically, no change.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.012
What is it?
What's going on?

25:47.312 --> 25:49.914
Okay, yeah.
I love you, mom.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.682
(static crackles)

25:53.685 --> 25:55.920
What's going on?

25:55.922 --> 26:00.958
The hospital knows that
my grandma doesn't have papers.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.193
She can be deported.

26:06.631 --> 26:08.766
(thunder rumbling)
how dare she?

26:08.768 --> 26:11.035
How dare she?
You know what I mean?

26:12.237 --> 26:13.971
How dare she just...

26:13.973 --> 26:15.873
Just come in here
and expect me...

26:15.875 --> 26:18.676
(door creaks open)

26:18.678 --> 26:20.578
(thunderclap)

26:22.714 --> 26:25.616
Mother? Mother?!

26:25.618 --> 26:27.184
Mother?!

26:27.186 --> 26:28.852
Mother?!

26:28.854 --> 26:30.621
Ivan:
Hello, petra.

26:30.623 --> 26:32.189
Let us talk.

26:33.658 --> 26:34.658
You give me

26:34.660 --> 26:36.660
The rest of your jewelry,

26:36.662 --> 26:38.696
And I will not
kill your mother.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.631
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Petra knew that ivan's gun</i>

26:40.633 --> 26:41.999
<i>Was inside that drawer.</i>

26:42.001 --> 26:43.267
<i>What she didn't know</i>

26:43.269 --> 26:46.670
<i>Was if she could</i>
<i>get to it in time.</i>

26:46.672 --> 26:48.939
Go ahead. I know
you're probably going

26:48.941 --> 26:51.141
To kill her anyway.
Petra!

26:51.143 --> 26:52.876
You would rather me
kill your mother

26:52.878 --> 26:54.044
Than part with your jewelry?

26:54.046 --> 26:57.014
I need to start over.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.083
And you've seen the way
she speaks to me.

26:59.918 --> 27:01.652
(magda yells, ivan grunts)

27:01.654 --> 27:03.153
Magda:
Kill him, petra.

27:04.222 --> 27:06.256
(grunts)

27:07.926 --> 27:09.193
Now what?

27:17.168 --> 27:19.203
(mouthing)

27:27.045 --> 27:30.114
It's my grandma's rosary.

27:30.116 --> 27:33.417
Oh. The one you used
before heritage day?

27:35.086 --> 27:39.189
Dear god, please, please,
let heritage day go well.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.225
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And a few days later...</i>

27:48.166 --> 27:52.036
Mom, these are amazing.

27:52.038 --> 27:54.304
<i>Jane knew</i>
<i>her prayer had worked.</i>

27:54.306 --> 27:57.441
I forgot I told you that story.

27:57.443 --> 28:00.210
Yeah.

28:02.414 --> 28:05.049
I haven't been around as much.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.217
With everything going on--
the pregnancy

28:07.219 --> 28:09.186
And the teaching job--

28:09.188 --> 28:11.789
I just haven't been around
as much.

28:11.791 --> 28:14.058
She knows you love her.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.459
I'm sorry.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.194
Come here.
Come here. It's okay.

28:17.196 --> 28:20.431
(elevator hums,
elevator bell dings)

28:22.434 --> 28:24.234
Are-are you okay?

28:27.372 --> 28:30.474
Um, let me know if you hear
anything about your <i>abuela.</i>

28:30.476 --> 28:33.377
Uh, I got to get back.

28:33.379 --> 28:36.046
I will. Thank you.

28:38.149 --> 28:39.383
Rogelio:
Okay. I left word

28:39.385 --> 28:42.419
With the un ambassador
and gloria estefan.

28:42.421 --> 28:45.022
One of them will
stop the deportation.

28:45.024 --> 28:47.291
Most probably
gloria estefan.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.759
I should hear
back shortly.

28:48.761 --> 28:50.861
Thank you.

28:50.863 --> 28:52.362
(thunder rumbling)

28:56.768 --> 28:59.803
I wasn't the daughter
she wanted, you know?

29:01.740 --> 29:05.175
I wasn't good or religious.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.311
She loves you
very much, xiomara.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.246
I'm certain of that.

29:09.248 --> 29:12.349
Oh, god, I must look
like a mess right now.

29:12.351 --> 29:15.953
Here. Have some concealer.

29:18.323 --> 29:21.125
Wow. That swag bag
really does have everything.

29:21.127 --> 29:24.294
This is mine. I always
carry it, just in case.

29:27.365 --> 29:29.133
(thunder rumbling)

29:29.135 --> 29:31.135
Rafael:
Everything okay?

29:31.137 --> 29:33.370
I wanted to talk
to you about frankie.

29:33.372 --> 29:35.405
Look, I looked up your
friend. She's a new hire.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.241
And she's been late a lot.
(electricity crackling)

29:37.243 --> 29:39.209
It's just...

29:39.211 --> 29:41.545
We go way back,
and she's got nothing saved.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.313
And I just got
my job back,

29:43.315 --> 29:45.249
And I have
to get the books in order,

29:45.251 --> 29:47.985
And what you're asking me
to do is...

29:47.987 --> 29:51.121
It-it's out of line.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.890
I know.

29:52.892 --> 29:55.359
And I wouldn't be asking
if it wasn't important.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.161
(sighs)

29:59.130 --> 30:01.532
The next person
on the list is...

30:01.534 --> 30:03.167
Regina johnson.

30:03.169 --> 30:05.302
Jane:
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no.</i>

30:05.304 --> 30:07.471
She's got two kids,
and she's always so sweet.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.573
It's either frankie
or it's regina.

30:09.575 --> 30:12.142
These things are never easy,
but they have to be done.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.311
Mr. Solano?
Coming.

30:14.313 --> 30:18.015
Check the circuit breaker.

30:18.017 --> 30:20.284
I would have left,
but the roads are closed.

30:20.286 --> 30:22.286
Get out!
Luisa,

30:22.288 --> 30:24.855
Please just let me say
one thing to you.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.258
I'm sorry.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.294
And I love you.

30:30.296 --> 30:33.430
And... Here.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.866
Latin lover narrator:
<i>You'll recall,</i>
<i>powdered sugar donuts are</i>

30:35.868 --> 30:38.402
<i>Rose and luisa's</i>
<i>post-coital go-to snack.</i>

30:38.404 --> 30:41.038
You think this makes up
for you locking me up?

30:41.040 --> 30:43.407
No, no. I can't...

30:43.409 --> 30:46.109
I can't make that up to you.

30:48.346 --> 30:52.182
But I can do other things.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.428
(gasps)

31:05.463 --> 31:08.465
Aah. That hurts.

31:08.467 --> 31:11.134
That's the point.

31:25.950 --> 31:29.519
Look, I'm gonna tell your
father the truth about us.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.555
I will.

31:31.557 --> 31:34.191
(sighs):
It's just...

31:34.193 --> 31:36.526
Now is not a good time.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.962
He's been
so on edge lately.

31:38.964 --> 31:42.432
Have you ever heard
of somebody named allegria?

31:42.434 --> 31:45.402
That's my grandmother
on my mom's side.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.437
My dad really loved her.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.406
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Rose wondered why emilio</i>

31:49.408 --> 31:51.408
<i>Would be spending money</i>
<i>on a dead woman.</i>

31:51.410 --> 31:53.377
He even named his house
in croatia after her.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.145
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

31:55.147 --> 31:58.048
<i>You see, this is</i>
<i>the information rose came for.</i>

32:00.351 --> 32:02.653
God...

32:02.655 --> 32:04.454
It's me, xo.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.456
Yeah, I know
it's been a while.

32:06.458 --> 32:09.626
Jane's not here.
She went to get her rosary,

32:09.628 --> 32:13.363
The one she used to pray that
I wouldn't mess up heritage day.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.232
So, I heard
you and jane

32:15.234 --> 32:17.701
Talking about how she's scared
I'll mess up the food.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.169
Can you make it?

32:19.171 --> 32:21.238
I don't want
to embarrass her.

32:24.075 --> 32:25.575
But, ma!

32:31.249 --> 32:33.550
Mom, these are amazing!

32:36.220 --> 32:37.621
See?

32:37.623 --> 32:40.057
That's my mom.

32:40.059 --> 32:42.392
She's always there.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.161
Even though

32:44.163 --> 32:47.030
I've made loads of mistakes,
she's always there.

32:47.032 --> 32:49.366
Help her, please.

32:49.368 --> 32:53.170
And in exchange...

32:53.172 --> 32:55.372
I'll live a better life.

32:55.374 --> 32:58.508
More... Godlike and all that.

32:58.510 --> 33:02.446
And maybe it was a coincidence,
<i>alba waking up as xo prayed.</i>

33:02.448 --> 33:04.581
<i>Or maybe it really was</i>
<i>a miracle.</i>

33:04.583 --> 33:06.350
I'll live a chaste life.

33:06.352 --> 33:09.419
<i>But the facts remain--</i>
<i>alba did wake up.</i>

33:09.421 --> 33:11.555
And I won't let a man
between these legs again

33:11.557 --> 33:13.190
Without a ring.

33:13.192 --> 33:16.159
<i>Not that she'd</i>
<i>let xiomara know that.</i>

33:19.097 --> 33:22.666
Okay... Thanks for
hearing me out.

33:26.337 --> 33:29.339
(gasps):
You're awake! Oh, my god!

33:29.341 --> 33:32.342
<i>Because sometimes faith</i>
<i>needs a little nudge.</i>

33:32.344 --> 33:35.045
My mom!
She's awake!

33:35.047 --> 33:36.179
Okay?

33:36.181 --> 33:38.015
Do you remember
the accident, ma?

33:44.322 --> 33:46.523
All right, well,
her vitals look good,

33:46.525 --> 33:48.125
And the swelling has gone down.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.426
Xiomara:
Oh, thank god.

33:53.531 --> 33:55.632
I think it's safe to say
that there's no sign

33:55.634 --> 33:57.134
Of any long-term damage.

33:57.136 --> 33:59.136
But we will run tests
to make certain.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.604
Now, as to the other matter...

34:00.606 --> 34:02.105
Oh. Please...

34:02.107 --> 34:03.473
Not here.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.275
Apparently, it has gone away.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.443
You must have friends

34:06.445 --> 34:07.511
In high places.

34:07.513 --> 34:09.279
Anyway, I was glad to hear it.

34:09.281 --> 34:13.116
<i>In this moment,</i>
<i>xiomara wanted to kiss rogelio</i>

34:13.118 --> 34:15.452
<i>For what he had done.</i>

34:15.454 --> 34:18.555
<i>But then she remembered</i>
<i>her promise to god</i>

34:18.557 --> 34:21.124
<i>About keeping her legs closed</i>
<i>and all.</i>

34:26.464 --> 34:29.633
Thanks...
For everything.

34:29.635 --> 34:32.569
A-as much as I'd like
to take credit,

34:32.571 --> 34:34.504
This wasn't my doing.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.576
Frankie:
Hi. Well,

34:39.578 --> 34:41.845
I guess I can finally say
I "stayed" at the marbella.

34:43.414 --> 34:44.614
(chuckles)

34:44.616 --> 34:48.151
So, look, I, uh...

34:48.153 --> 34:49.653
I talked to rafael.

34:49.655 --> 34:52.155
I'm sorry, frankie,
there's nothing I can do.

34:54.125 --> 34:55.659
Nothing you can do?

34:55.661 --> 34:58.495
If it's not you,
it's someone else.
Wow.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.230
What's going on?
I'm fired.

35:00.232 --> 35:00.864
What?

35:00.866 --> 35:02.532
Luca:
Come on,

35:02.534 --> 35:05.435
Let's get some breakfast.

35:11.676 --> 35:12.843
(phone ringing)

35:12.845 --> 35:15.112
Mom? How's abuela?

35:17.548 --> 35:20.717
Thank god.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.622
Hey. Going home
to crash?

35:25.624 --> 35:28.258
Mm, can't. I got to take
the kids to school.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.894
I swear, they drain all
the life out of you.
(chuckles)

35:30.896 --> 35:33.463
Oh, um... But
they're worth it.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.832
Oh... (laughs)
they are... They
are so worth it.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.734
Thank you.

35:42.206 --> 35:44.441
I owe you an apology.

35:44.443 --> 35:47.777
I put you in
a terrible situation.

35:48.746 --> 35:50.147
Thank you.

35:50.149 --> 35:51.715
I appreciate that.

35:51.717 --> 35:54.484
Can I ask you a question?

35:54.486 --> 35:55.552
Sure.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.587
I wasn't on that list.

35:57.589 --> 35:59.589
Of course not.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.758
Because of my stellar record
as a waitress?

36:01.760 --> 36:03.660
Uh, yes.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.629
Because we're having a baby?

36:05.631 --> 36:08.465
It would be weird if
I fired you, don't you think?

36:08.467 --> 36:11.201
Probably.

36:11.203 --> 36:14.237
I just have to accept the fact
that things have changed,

36:14.239 --> 36:16.740
That I've changed,
just like my friends said.

36:16.742 --> 36:19.242
You have not changed.
Okay? You would have never

36:19.244 --> 36:21.578
Gotten someone else fired
in frankie's place.

36:21.580 --> 36:22.846
No, of course not.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.848
But, like, in other ways.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.550
I'm different now.

36:26.552 --> 36:29.753
And I see babies,
and I find myself

36:29.755 --> 36:31.254
Trying to guess their age.

36:32.390 --> 36:34.224
What?

36:34.226 --> 36:35.625
I-I...

36:35.627 --> 36:37.561
I do that, too.

36:38.729 --> 36:40.764
And I am always so off,
by the way.

36:40.766 --> 36:43.800
Oh, my god, me, too!

36:43.802 --> 36:44.801
Come here.

36:49.574 --> 36:51.908
Rafael solano's prints weren't
found anywhere in that room.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.644
But here are the patient records
from the recovery suites.

36:57.315 --> 36:59.449
(sighs)

37:02.853 --> 37:05.222
â™ª

37:25.843 --> 37:28.712
Michael:
<i>They were performing</i>

37:28.714 --> 37:30.847
Plastic surgery
on criminals in this room.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.582
Changing their faces.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.285
What?
Microscopic bone fragments
were found on the floor.

37:35.287 --> 37:37.621
That had to come from
cutting into facial bones.

37:37.623 --> 37:40.257
If you're performing boob jobs
or harvesting organs,

37:40.259 --> 37:41.558
You're not cutting
through bone.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.026
Oh, my god.
The silicone we found

37:43.028 --> 37:45.996
Could have been for... For
chin or-or cheek implants.

37:45.998 --> 37:48.531
Exactly. Then I found this
in the recovery suite.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.834
Patient 3-2-0.

37:52.737 --> 37:54.804
Look at the two x-rays.
They were taken 12 hours apart.

37:54.806 --> 37:58.275
Same patient, but you can see
their facial structure

37:58.277 --> 38:00.277
Is slightly different
post-surgery.

38:01.846 --> 38:04.614
These were taken the same day
the serbian disappeared.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.449
Could he be patient 3-2-0?

38:06.451 --> 38:07.651
Talk to me,
talk to me.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.286
Is he there?

38:09.288 --> 38:11.988
He must have signed himself out
when the roads reopened

38:11.990 --> 38:13.490
About an hour ago.

38:13.492 --> 38:14.891
We have his picture--
we can send out

38:14.893 --> 38:15.859
An apb with his face on it.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.560
Don't bother.

38:17.562 --> 38:19.863
That is not his face anymore.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.805
I'll sell my jewelry.

38:28.807 --> 38:29.939
We'll be okay.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.808
I'd say we got

38:31.810 --> 38:34.010
48 hours before milos finds out

38:34.012 --> 38:34.978
Where we are,

38:34.980 --> 38:38.581
And then the real storm begins.

38:41.752 --> 38:43.687
The aluminum windows should
have withstood the hurricane.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.355
If they need repairs,
we'll have to talk

38:45.357 --> 38:47.924
To the contractor, but
I went over every square inch

38:47.926 --> 38:49.459
Of the renovation plans
with him.

38:49.461 --> 38:50.927
Nothing ever happens
in this hotel

38:50.929 --> 38:52.095
Without rafael knowing about it.

38:54.365 --> 38:56.900
Hey.
Hi.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.369
Are you ready
to go see your grandma?

38:59.371 --> 39:00.870
Yeah. Thanks for driving me.

39:00.872 --> 39:01.771
Of course.

39:01.773 --> 39:02.806
What's wrong?

39:02.808 --> 39:04.441
Look, I-I'm...

39:04.443 --> 39:06.843
I'm sorry to even ask this,
but the passports

39:06.845 --> 39:09.713
And the phone that michael said
he saw in your safe,

39:09.715 --> 39:11.681
Did he just make that all up?

39:13.017 --> 39:15.852
No. Not all of it.

39:16.987 --> 39:18.388
I do keep cash in there,

39:18.390 --> 39:19.889
And I needed
an international phone

39:19.891 --> 39:21.391
When I traveled
to find luisa.

39:21.393 --> 39:22.959
And I heard
that michael

39:22.961 --> 39:25.128
Was snooping around,
so I moved it.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.563
Look,

39:26.565 --> 39:28.098
The guy's got it in for me.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.367
He's trying to get in your head,
and he clearly has,

39:30.369 --> 39:31.901
Because you are
standing in front of me

39:31.903 --> 39:34.637
Thinking that I might be
some kind of bad guy.

39:34.639 --> 39:37.073
That I might have something
to do with this...

39:37.075 --> 39:40.076
Crazy sin rostro.

39:40.078 --> 39:41.711
I know you don't.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.413
I'm sorry I even asked.

39:43.415 --> 39:46.049
Please don't let michael
get between us.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.818
No. I won't.

39:49.987 --> 39:51.454
(chuckles)

39:53.557 --> 39:55.525
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Remember when I said luisa</i>

39:55.527 --> 39:57.927
<i>Had been enjoying her time</i>
<i>in the mental hospital?</i>

39:57.929 --> 39:59.763
<i>That was certainly true.</i>

39:59.765 --> 40:04.167
<i>However, she enjoyed</i>
<i>her freedom much, much more.</i>

40:04.169 --> 40:07.704
â™ª

40:07.706 --> 40:09.172
Hey, betty,

40:09.174 --> 40:12.442
Do you know anything
about picking locks?

40:16.547 --> 40:20.183
Rose? What's going on?
You sounded upset.

40:20.185 --> 40:21.851
I am.

40:22.787 --> 40:24.621
Rafael, it's your father.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.890
I'm worried he's involved
in something criminal.

40:26.892 --> 40:29.058
Wait, what?

40:29.060 --> 40:30.627
I heard him on the phone

40:30.629 --> 40:32.629
Taking five million
out of his account

40:32.631 --> 40:35.064
And secretly planning
to move to allegria,

40:35.066 --> 40:36.833
His house in croatia.

40:42.206 --> 40:45.141
I think he's going to try
to flee the country.

40:45.143 --> 40:47.977
Whoa, wait, wait, wait. Why do
you think he would try to flee?

40:47.979 --> 40:49.446
What if your father

40:49.448 --> 40:51.514
Is sin rostro?

40:55.085 --> 40:56.553
(phone beeps)

40:57.555 --> 40:58.688
Detective cordero.

40:58.690 --> 40:59.889
Michael,

40:59.891 --> 41:00.890
It's xo.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.492
Oh, hey.

41:02.494 --> 41:03.660
How's alba?

41:03.662 --> 41:06.229
Much better, thanks to you.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.033
What do you mean?

41:10.035 --> 41:11.901
(sighs)
come on, you're the only one

41:11.903 --> 41:13.536
Besides jane and rogelio

41:13.538 --> 41:16.139
Who knew that alba was
in trouble with deportation.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.741
This is detective cordero with
the miami police department.

41:18.743 --> 41:21.511
We need a patient of yours,
alba villanueva.

41:21.513 --> 41:25.482
She is a very important witness
in an ongoing investigation.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.150
Well, please don't tell jane.

41:27.152 --> 41:31.187
She'll think I did it just to...
Try and win her back.

41:31.189 --> 41:34.491
You still love her, don't you?

41:34.493 --> 41:36.559
I'm not just gonna
give up on us.

41:36.561 --> 41:39.062
You know?

41:39.064 --> 41:41.498
We belong together.

41:41.500 --> 41:44.167
And I'll never stop
believing that.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.836
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And for as long</i>
<i>as michael lived,</i>

41:46.838 --> 41:49.272
<i>Until he drew</i>
<i>his very last breath,</i>

41:49.274 --> 41:51.074
<i>He never did.</i>
