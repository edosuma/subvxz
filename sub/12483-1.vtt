02:49.461 --> 02:51.086
Oh, man.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.885
That's it.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.930
Nice grab.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.518
Oh, yeah.

03:09.105 --> 03:12.107
- All right, Danny, your turn.
- What? I didn't get my full turn.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.777
You did. I counted.
That was 25. That's what we said.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.653
- That's not fair.
- It's exactly fair.

03:16.821 --> 03:20.115
Come on, Danny. Time for your turn,
then I gotta work for an hour.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.910
You're not the only one
who gets a turn.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.787
"The only one who gets a turn."

03:24.954 --> 03:26.372
Guys.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.332
All right.

03:29.250 --> 03:33.087
Keep your eye on the ball.
You got it this time. Ready?

03:36.007 --> 03:39.218
All right, that's a good try.
It was a bad throw. It's a bad throw.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.137
Sorry. My bad.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.266
Okay. Here we go.
You can do this.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.644
Here we go. Ready?

03:49.813 --> 03:51.063
Okay.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.982
A deep fly ball to right field.

03:54.150 --> 03:57.069
Clemente back,
running on his horse real fast.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.113
Can he get it? Can he get it?

03:59.280 --> 04:02.408
Oh, and Milton Bradley with
his dive-and-roll catch.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.744
- Dodgers win.
- You're such a dick.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.167
What? It was a great grab.

04:14.295 --> 04:20.426
Danny?

04:31.813 --> 04:35.607
Danny, you should not be using that
kind of language with your brother.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.735
But it's true.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.113
Listen, kiddo,
when I was 6 years old...

04:41.281 --> 04:44.116
- Six and three quarters.
- When I was 6 and three quarters...

04:44.284 --> 04:46.452
...catching was hard for me too.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.620
Well, it's not hard for Walter.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.372
Well, Walter's 10.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.708
So? He's still better than me
at everything.

04:52.876 --> 04:56.003
No way.
He's not better than you at piano.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.213
I hate that stupid thing.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.843
Someday you're gonna be
really happy I got you that piano.

05:03.011 --> 05:07.306
- You'll be at a party, there'll be a girl...
- Like you and Mom?

05:12.896 --> 05:14.980
Look, Danny...

05:15.148 --> 05:16.982
...you and Walter
are different people.

05:17.150 --> 05:21.236
He's good at some things, you're good
at other things. That's how people are.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.739
He beats me at everything.

05:23.907 --> 05:26.575
Listen to me, this is important.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.286
You're a very special kid.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.749
That's what people say
when they can't think of anything.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.834
You know how you always
make up games...

05:36.002 --> 05:38.504
...and pretend to be characters?

05:38.672 --> 05:41.548
You have an incredible imagination.

05:42.509 --> 05:47.096
Amazing imagination.
A whole universe of an imagination.

05:47.263 --> 05:51.767
And I use my imagination for a living,
so I know what I'm talking about.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.271
- Is it better than Walter's?
- What?

05:56.439 --> 05:59.817
Is my imagination better
than Walter's?

06:04.948 --> 06:06.782
You're different than Walter.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.958
- Don't do that.
- You wanna play catch?

06:16.126 --> 06:18.127
- We just played catch.
- No, football catch.

06:18.294 --> 06:19.712
I have to work for an hour.

06:19.879 --> 06:23.173
- But it's Saturday.
- Tell me about it.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.303
- All you ever do is work.
- Nice try.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.431
- This is so unfair.
- Hello.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.474
Bill, I am so sorry.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.477
I'll call you back in two minutes.
Is that okay?

06:35.645 --> 06:36.895
Thanks.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.982
I have an important meeting
this afternoon.

06:40.150 --> 06:43.277
- I've... I really have to be ready for it.
- You're going out?

06:43.445 --> 06:45.988
Yes, I'm going out.
Well, I'm going to a meeting.

06:46.156 --> 06:49.074
You're gonna be at Mom's house.
She's coming to get you at 3.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.576
We go to Mom's tomorrow.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.953
- No, today.
- This is a four-day Dad week.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.913
Three-day Dad week.
Four-day last week...

06:55.081 --> 06:56.749
...four-day next week,
three-day this week.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.542
Four-day Mom week this week.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.461
But that's not fair.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.338
- To whom?
- To anyone.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.672
I have to work.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.675
We'd have all the time
if Danny wasn't around.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.719
Well, Danny is around.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.014
All right, five throws.

07:12.182 --> 07:15.225
How do I put this? Let me think.
I have to work.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.062
Dad, I'm ready to play
"Smash Bros."

07:18.229 --> 07:20.022
You told him you'd play
"Smash Bros."?

07:20.190 --> 07:22.524
I didn't tell him I was gonna
play "Smash Bros."

07:22.734 --> 07:25.944
- You're playing catch with Walter?
- He might if you weren't around.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.405
You're so mean.
Everybody wants to ruin my life.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.366
You never keep your promises.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.117
There's only one of me, okay?

07:32.786 --> 07:35.829
I don't like this situation either,
it sucks, is what it does...

07:35.997 --> 07:38.040
...but it's the best I could
come up with.

07:38.208 --> 07:42.211
So climb off my back and give me
about two inches of space, will you?

07:59.354 --> 08:04.692
There are some days, boys,
when you gotta grow up all at once.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.736
I need today to be
one of those days.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.330
Wanna play Chutes and Ladders?

08:19.457 --> 08:20.749
No, you'll cheat.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.584
Stratego?

08:23.545 --> 08:25.254
No, you cheat at board games.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.923
But you can't even cheat at Stratego.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.717
Trust me, you'll find a way.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.260
Hey. Sorry about that.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.679
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.347
I'm not meeting him till 3:30,
I can finish by then.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.183
Walter, look what I found.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.269
Those belong to me. Put them back.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.395
But you never play with them.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.356
So? They're still mine.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.608
When did you get so mean?

08:46.776 --> 08:48.193
I'm not mean, Danny.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.529
I'm in fourth grade,
I have a girlfriend.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.614
You know how Dad said
we have to grow up?

08:52.782 --> 08:54.450
Well, this is what it looks like.

08:54.617 --> 08:57.286
Can we please play "Army Men"?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.250
Copy that.

09:03.418 --> 09:06.879
Sergeant, there is a helicopter on fire.
Let's get it.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.964
The drawings all match
the foam mock-up.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.632
- Get back here.
- Let me hold it.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.634
- Yes, red.
- Give me.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.220
Cranberry, right.
It's whatever color they picked.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.638
I worked from the chits.

09:16.806 --> 09:21.310
Can I call you back one more time?
It's a small domestic emergency here.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.062
I... I... I know. I know.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.814
- Dad.
- It's not a problem. Okay, thanks.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.983
- Look what he did.
- I was on the phone.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.486
- It was an accident.
- You're such a baby.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.571
- I'm not a baby.
- You break all my stuff.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.573
- You can't catch a ball...
- Enough.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.909
...and nobody wants you around.
- You shut up!

09:40.747 --> 09:42.831
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.879
It's 10 minutes to the office.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.173
I have to run off another copy.
I'll be back.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.842
You're gonna leave us alone
in this creepy old house?

09:54.010 --> 09:56.345
- It's not creepy, it's old.
- I like Mom's better.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.430
Well, so did she, and now it's hers.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.022
Look, this is a very special house.

10:07.190 --> 10:11.276
The reason I'm working to fix it up
is I wanna make a home for us here.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.613
I know it's not Mom's house,
and I know it's a little creaky...

10:14.781 --> 10:17.449
...but give it some time,
it's gonna grow on you.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.201
I don't wanna stay here alone.

10:19.369 --> 10:22.621
Well, you're not gonna be alone.
I'm going to wake up Lisa.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.873
- Don't wake up Lisa.
- What, are you crazy?

10:25.041 --> 10:26.959
She's sleeping. Let her sleep.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.545
Honey.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.047
Lisa. Honey.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.799
Get up.

10:33.967 --> 10:38.053
I need to go out. I need you to
look after your two favorite people.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.597
Come on.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.227
I can't. I have a date tonight.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.937
What time?

10:47.355 --> 10:49.148
We're hooking up at, like, 8.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.735
- It's 2.
- So?

10:52.902 --> 10:55.529
- So that's six hours from now.
- What's your point?

10:55.697 --> 10:57.072
I need you to look after the boys.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.075
By the way, it makes me uncomfortable
when you say "hooking up."

11:00.243 --> 11:03.245
Why? It's not like it means anything.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.914
- Hope it doesn't.
- It doesn't. It's just an expression.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.834
- Hope it is.
- It is. God.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.086
We never should have
rented Thirteen.

11:11.254 --> 11:14.840
Keep your eye on them. Make sure
they don't burn down the house.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.551
- Okay?
- I'm not deaf.

11:18.261 --> 11:19.887
- I'm not deaf.
- What?

11:20.055 --> 11:21.305
Dad, okay.

11:21.473 --> 11:24.016
Fifteen minutes, just close the door.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.769
Thank you.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.284
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I am.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.119
Yeah, hold on.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.978
Hey!

12:10.563 --> 12:11.980
Dad said no video games.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.316
He did not.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.443
Fine.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.658
It's a giraffe.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.500
- This is SportsCenter.
- Hey.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.460
I was watching that.

12:33.837 --> 12:37.172
It is Oakland. It is Boston.
It is Manny Ramirez.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.967
- Can't we watch SpongeBob?
- No.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.970
- You used to like it.
- Times change.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.139
Tartar sauce.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.515
I'm hungry.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.392
What do you want me
to do about it?

12:48.560 --> 12:50.310
Make me macaroni and cheese?

12:50.478 --> 12:51.687
I don't know how.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.856
I'm hungry.
What do you know how to make?

12:54.024 --> 12:55.524
Water.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.694
Two-run shot. Are you kidding me?

12:58.862 --> 13:00.738
Next batter, Jason Varitek.

13:00.905 --> 13:04.783
In the air to deep right field.
Down the line, towards the pole.

13:05.952 --> 13:09.455
- How about if you and me play catch?
- No.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.544
The first guy to give up
walk-off home runs...

13:15.712 --> 13:18.714
...on consecutive days since 1998.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.966
Bo Sox win it 6 to 5.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.727
History-making moment for...

13:32.896 --> 13:34.229
You're dead!

13:34.397 --> 13:36.607
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.668
Danny?

13:57.754 --> 13:59.963
Where are you?

14:03.968 --> 14:06.095
Danny?

14:08.056 --> 14:10.182
Where are you, Danny?

14:14.229 --> 14:15.979
Danny?

14:16.773 --> 14:18.816
Where are you?

14:20.819 --> 14:23.070
- There you are.
- I said I was sorry.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.115
Don't. No.

14:27.325 --> 14:30.786
- Don't do that, it's not funny.
- You'll be safe here till Dad gets back.

14:30.954 --> 14:34.873
You're just jealous because
Dad thinks I'm smarter than you.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.459
I didn't mean that.

14:39.421 --> 14:43.882
Walter. No. Pull me up. Don't.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.300
What's the matter, Danny?

14:45.468 --> 14:48.137
Not still scared of the basement,
are you?

14:48.638 --> 14:51.223
Walter! No, Walter!

14:51.391 --> 14:53.058
It's not funny! No!

14:55.270 --> 14:57.813
Pull me up! Walter!

14:57.981 --> 15:00.816
Three-year-olds
are scared of basements.

17:19.289 --> 17:21.248
You're really mean.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.084
Dad said not to play in there.

17:26.796 --> 17:29.506
Look what I found in the basement.

17:29.841 --> 17:31.800
Looks dumb and old.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.927
I like it.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.971
Yeah, you would, it's for babies.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.481
Walter, this is so cool.
Check this out.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.784
What's Zathura?

18:10.006 --> 18:12.007
- Will you play with me?
- No.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.843
- I won't cheat.
- Yeah, you will.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.548
- A card came out.
- Fascinating.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.220
"Me... Mete...

18:58.388 --> 19:01.724
Meor sho...

19:01.891 --> 19:05.394
Meeor sh... sho..."

19:06.354 --> 19:07.396
Read this for me.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.151
"Meteor shower.
Take evasive action."

19:12.318 --> 19:13.861
What's evasive action?

19:14.029 --> 19:15.612
It's when you get out of the way.

19:15.780 --> 19:19.158
What exactly am I supposed to
get out of the way of, exactly?

19:19.325 --> 19:22.411
I have no idea.
All it says is "Take evasive a..."

19:47.520 --> 19:48.937
Grandma.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.780
It's meteors!

19:57.947 --> 20:03.243
Take evasive action!

20:27.977 --> 20:29.228
Danny, in here.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.729
Danny, hurry up. It's safe.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.272
Danny, come on. Hurry.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.899
Danny, come on, hurry up.

20:34.067 --> 20:37.444
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Come on. Get in, get in.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.670
This is SportsCenter.

20:56.047 --> 20:58.465
Schilling deals no love...

21:21.197 --> 21:24.742
I don't think we should play
that game anymore.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.886
That's weird.

21:44.763 --> 21:47.014
It only hit the living room.

22:03.698 --> 22:06.617
Wow, outer space.

22:06.785 --> 22:08.369
No, that's just nighttime.

22:10.330 --> 22:14.166
I don't know, Walter.
Night never looked so close before.

22:21.424 --> 22:22.716
Wait.

22:27.931 --> 22:30.391
Walter, check this out.

23:58.855 --> 24:00.481
- Tell her.
- You tell her.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.524
You should,
she won't freak out as much.

24:02.692 --> 24:04.485
We shouldn't really even be in here.

24:04.652 --> 24:06.820
Dude, we're in outer space.
It doesn't matter.

24:06.988 --> 24:08.530
Then you wake her.

24:08.698 --> 24:10.366
Fine.

24:11.659 --> 24:12.993
Lisa.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.537
Lisa. Lisa...

24:15.705 --> 24:18.165
- Go away.
- Lisa, you gotta get up.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.167
What's the rule about
being in my room?

24:20.335 --> 24:22.336
We're not allowed
unless it's an emergency.

24:23.004 --> 24:24.380
And what's the emergency?

24:24.547 --> 24:27.216
There was a meteor shower
and everything got wrecked.

24:27.384 --> 24:29.385
- We can't get back to Earth.
- Shut up!

24:29.552 --> 24:31.553
- Just look.
- Yeah.

24:34.557 --> 24:36.392
- Oh, no.
- What do we do?

24:36.559 --> 24:38.435
It's already dark?
I'm gonna be so late.

24:38.603 --> 24:40.396
- It's not dark.
- We're in outer space.

24:40.563 --> 24:42.898
I saw Saturn outside.

24:44.442 --> 24:46.235
Lisa, open up.

24:46.403 --> 24:48.529
Shut up and listen to me.

24:48.697 --> 24:50.614
Dad put me in charge
until he got home.

24:50.782 --> 24:52.783
Which means you guys
need to do what I say.

24:52.951 --> 24:55.494
Do me a favor. Go downstairs
and stay out of my face.

24:55.662 --> 24:56.912
But it's an emergency.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.747
- Is the house on fire?
- No.

24:58.915 --> 25:00.416
- Is anyone hurt?
- No, but...

25:00.583 --> 25:02.334
- Then leave.
- Lisa, please.

25:02.502 --> 25:05.421
We're really scared. Can you just
watch what this game does?

25:08.425 --> 25:11.677
lf this is some weird joke you guys
are trying to pull, you're dead.

25:11.845 --> 25:13.137
No, it's not a joke.

25:13.304 --> 25:15.597
Here, watch this. Watch this. Here.

25:15.765 --> 25:19.184
- Okay. So wind the key.
- All right.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.520
- So now I'm winding the key.
- Yeah, see?

25:21.688 --> 25:23.689
- And then push the button.
- So I push it?

25:23.857 --> 25:25.107
- Yeah.
- Pushing the button.

25:25.275 --> 25:28.193
Then the number winds,
and whatever the number is, like nine.

25:28.361 --> 25:29.945
Then your ship... The blue ship...

25:30.113 --> 25:32.448
...because the red ship is mine,
I got a five.

25:32.615 --> 25:36.201
So then it goes to nine,
which would be that thing.

25:36.369 --> 25:38.370
- All right.
- Then the card's gonna pop out.

25:38.538 --> 25:39.580
- The card.
- The card.

25:39.748 --> 25:41.457
- The card!
- The card!

25:41.958 --> 25:43.625
- The card.
- Here's the scary part.

25:44.461 --> 25:46.295
"You're promoted to
a starship captain.

25:46.463 --> 25:47.921
Move ahead two spaces."

25:50.300 --> 25:51.550
Fascinating.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.844
- Lisa, no, no! Lisa!
- No, wait, Lisa!

25:54.012 --> 25:57.097
Wait, that one didn't count.
Let me go. Let me go. Here. Okay.

26:00.143 --> 26:01.393
It's stuck.

26:01.561 --> 26:04.480
Maybe we have to take turns.

26:05.065 --> 26:06.648
See? It was my turn.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.026
- Four.
- Yeah, four.

26:13.615 --> 26:14.823
Card.

26:16.785 --> 26:20.329
"Shipmate enters cryonic
sleep chamber for five turns."

26:20.997 --> 26:22.498
What the heck does that mean?

26:36.596 --> 26:38.138
Lisa?

26:38.306 --> 26:41.016
Does "cryonic" mean ice?

26:41.267 --> 26:43.018
Lisa.

26:45.939 --> 26:47.439
Help.

27:15.385 --> 27:17.052
I killed her.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.595
You didn't kill her.

27:18.763 --> 27:21.140
She's frozen in cryonic sleep.

27:23.393 --> 27:25.227
I gotta melt her.

27:41.453 --> 27:43.412
Are you crazy?

27:43.580 --> 27:45.414
We can't just leave her here
like this.

27:45.582 --> 27:48.334
Maybe we should read
the instructions.

27:53.256 --> 27:55.883
"Zathura.
Attention, space adventurers.

27:56.051 --> 27:57.676
Zathura awaits.

27:57.844 --> 28:00.179
Do you have what it takes
to navigate the galaxy?

28:00.347 --> 28:02.264
It's not for the faint of heart.

28:02.432 --> 28:04.183
For once you embark
upon your journey...

28:04.351 --> 28:06.602
...there's no turning back
until Zathura's reached.

28:06.770 --> 28:08.729
Pieces reset
at the end of each game.

28:08.897 --> 28:11.440
Play again and again
for different adventures."

28:11.608 --> 28:14.193
That's it. We gotta keep playing.

28:14.361 --> 28:16.236
I'm not playing that thing.

28:16.404 --> 28:18.864
Yes, we are.
It says we go home if we win.

28:19.032 --> 28:20.866
It... It didn't say that.

28:21.034 --> 28:23.619
Yes, it did. "Pieces reset
at the end of each game."

28:23.787 --> 28:25.788
That means we go home
when we're finished.

28:25.955 --> 28:29.708
All I know is that when we play
this game, bad things happen.

28:29.876 --> 28:32.211
All I know is that when I played,
I got promoted.

28:32.379 --> 28:34.171
So I'm gonna win this
and get us home.

28:34.339 --> 28:36.090
- Wait, can we...?
- Don't be a baby.

28:36.257 --> 28:37.549
I'm not a baby.

28:45.141 --> 28:46.809
Look, eight, I'm halfway there.

29:01.408 --> 29:03.409
"Your robot is defective."

29:03.660 --> 29:05.160
What does that mean?

29:05.328 --> 29:06.745
Means my robot's broken.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.331
But you don't even have a robot.

29:37.068 --> 29:40.320
Emergency.

29:47.579 --> 29:49.163
That's your robot?

29:49.330 --> 29:51.707
- At least I got one.
- Well, what does it do?

29:51.875 --> 29:55.336
Anything I want.
Get me a juice box, beyotch.

29:55.503 --> 29:57.546
- Don't do that.
- Why not? It's my robot.

29:57.714 --> 29:59.798
- You might make it mad.
- It's 3 inches tall.

29:59.966 --> 30:02.384
I'll punt it across the room.
My robot, the card says.

30:02.552 --> 30:05.554
I never said it wasn't your robot.
You don't have to be a jerk.

30:05.722 --> 30:08.349
Dude, you're just jealous
I have a robot and you don't.

30:08.516 --> 30:10.559
- Why would I want...?
- Emergency.

30:12.479 --> 30:14.355
Emergency.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.451
Alien life form.

30:27.619 --> 30:29.495
Must destroy.

30:29.662 --> 30:32.414
Walter, I think he's talking
about you.

31:29.723 --> 31:31.557
Alien life form.

31:31.725 --> 31:33.642
Must destroy.

31:34.686 --> 31:37.312
Danny, take your turn.

31:47.032 --> 31:49.199
- There's no key.
- Find it.

32:14.517 --> 32:16.518
Take it, take it. Come on, hurry.

32:40.710 --> 32:42.878
Take your turn!

33:01.147 --> 33:03.232
Why didn't you go?
I could have been killed.

33:03.400 --> 33:06.527
I was scared. But it's okay,
he's gone, isn't he?

33:52.782 --> 33:54.783
Danny, take your turn.

34:06.796 --> 34:09.547
- Danny, give me the card.
- It's still moving.

34:12.802 --> 34:14.762
Hurry up, Danny.

34:16.431 --> 34:17.973
The card.

34:37.744 --> 34:40.079
What did the card say?

35:08.608 --> 35:12.361
"You pass too close to Tsouris-3.
Enter gravity field."

35:26.459 --> 35:54.528
Danny!

35:55.280 --> 35:57.156
Walter!

36:47.082 --> 36:48.791
What?

36:53.797 --> 36:56.048
- What happened?
- It's Lisa.

37:03.473 --> 37:05.933
Is she okay?

37:14.484 --> 37:17.486
Walter, do you think she's okay?

37:18.279 --> 37:20.989
I guess. She's still in one piece.

37:22.158 --> 37:23.784
What happened to the robot?

37:42.178 --> 37:43.679
What are you doing?

37:43.847 --> 37:45.973
I think it's dead.

37:53.231 --> 37:54.857
Get up here.

38:46.993 --> 38:49.244
Do you think the door
will hold the robot?

38:49.412 --> 38:50.871
No.

38:51.790 --> 38:53.415
Great.

38:53.583 --> 38:57.878
Yeah, once he fixes himself,
we're screwed.

38:58.046 --> 38:59.630
He's fixing himself?

38:59.798 --> 39:01.423
How should I know?

39:12.060 --> 39:13.686
Looks about right.

39:13.853 --> 39:15.604
You think she's okay?

39:15.772 --> 39:18.607
I don't wanna be here
when she wakes up.

39:18.775 --> 39:20.984
Where are you going?

39:22.904 --> 39:24.446
Taking my turn.

39:24.614 --> 39:28.283
Are you crazy?
That thing's messed up.

39:31.788 --> 39:35.624
"You're promoted to fleet admiral.
Move ahead four spaces."

39:43.174 --> 39:47.177
- Okay, your turn.
- I'm not playing.

39:53.893 --> 39:56.603
- What are you doing?
- Making mac and cheese.

39:58.189 --> 40:00.482
There's no water, dummy,
we're in outer space.

40:06.322 --> 40:07.614
Why are you doing that?

40:07.866 --> 40:10.868
Because I'm hungry and I know
you're not gonna take care of me.

40:11.494 --> 40:13.162
Don't bother, the gas won't work.

40:15.874 --> 40:17.624
Any more advice?

40:17.792 --> 40:20.210
You've gotta turn it up more.

40:24.591 --> 40:26.258
Can we at least talk about this?

40:26.426 --> 40:28.594
There's nothing to talk about,
I'm not going.

40:31.556 --> 40:36.018
Danny, I just wanna go home,
and I can't unless you play.

40:37.020 --> 40:38.854
Don't you wanna get home?

40:39.022 --> 40:40.689
What's so great
about home, anyway?

40:40.857 --> 40:43.692
What do you mean? Everything
was great until you came along.

40:43.860 --> 40:46.028
See? You treat me
like everything's my fault.

40:46.196 --> 40:48.864
You're the one who pushed the button
in the first place.

40:49.032 --> 40:52.326
I just wanted to play
a game with you, Walter.

40:53.161 --> 40:54.495
Fine, what do you want?

40:55.914 --> 40:58.874
I want you not to be mean to me,
not ignore me...

40:59.042 --> 41:01.335
...and I want you to treat me
like your brother.

41:01.503 --> 41:04.380
- Fine.
- Do we have an understanding?

41:04.547 --> 41:06.215
Yeah.

41:07.258 --> 41:09.009
Wasn't that easy?

41:21.731 --> 41:23.399
Six.

41:34.828 --> 41:36.412
"You are visited by Zorgons."

41:37.080 --> 41:39.081
What's a Zorgon?

41:39.249 --> 41:42.584
I don't think it's bad. Just visitors.

42:06.109 --> 42:07.943
Zorgons!

42:46.983 --> 42:48.400
Maybe they're friendly.

42:51.946 --> 42:53.947
They're not friendly!

42:56.868 --> 43:00.162
The fireplace. Hide in the fireplace.

43:21.351 --> 43:22.851
Run!

43:36.324 --> 43:39.159
Told you I didn't wanna go.
You're the one who made me spin.

43:39.327 --> 43:40.994
There's nothing else we could do.

43:51.047 --> 43:53.674
- Are you crazy?
- Got any better ideas?

44:05.645 --> 44:08.355
"Reprogram"?
What the heck does that mean?

44:08.523 --> 44:09.982
How am I supposed to know?

44:14.237 --> 44:15.571
Reprogram!

44:32.714 --> 44:34.757
It didn't work.

44:34.924 --> 44:36.383
We'll figure it out later.

44:44.100 --> 44:45.559
Go.

44:45.727 --> 44:47.519
- No.
- Go.

44:47.687 --> 44:49.229
- No!
- Go!

45:10.543 --> 45:14.797
"Rest on standing AstroTurf."

45:15.465 --> 45:18.801
- What?
- Rest on standing AstroTurf.

45:19.260 --> 45:21.178
- Let me read it.
- No, I know how to read.

45:21.346 --> 45:25.808
- I know how to read.
- Let me read it. God.

45:25.975 --> 45:27.893
"Rescue stranded astronaut."

45:28.061 --> 45:29.937
What stranded astronaut?

45:30.105 --> 45:33.440
I guess there's gonna be some
stranded astronaut or some...

46:03.596 --> 46:05.889
Did you lock the door?

46:06.683 --> 46:08.017
I don't know.

46:56.608 --> 46:58.192
Which one of you spun me?

47:00.403 --> 47:03.572
- Who was it?
- Him.

47:04.240 --> 47:06.533
Don't be so quick
to sell out your brother, kid.

47:06.701 --> 47:08.410
He's all you got.

47:12.874 --> 47:15.876
Looks like you got a pretty serious
Zorgon problem.

47:16.044 --> 47:17.336
Yeah, what do we do?

47:18.922 --> 47:20.589
- Hide.
- Hide?

47:20.757 --> 47:23.175
They'll just explode
the whole house.

47:23.510 --> 47:25.886
We're gonna hide the house.

47:35.480 --> 47:37.940
Turn off all the lights
and electrical appliances.

47:38.108 --> 47:40.275
- Me?
- Yes, you. Go. Do it.

47:42.278 --> 47:43.779
Okay.

47:46.282 --> 47:48.283
You. Come on,
kill that flame on the stove.

47:48.451 --> 47:49.535
Okay.

47:58.878 --> 48:02.548
Burning gas. That's probably what
brought them in the first place.

48:08.304 --> 48:11.265
Okay. Now get the pilot light
on the furnace.

48:11.599 --> 48:12.808
What's a pilot light?

48:13.560 --> 48:17.938
In the basement.
Little blue flame under the big heater.

48:18.356 --> 48:20.649
Blow it out like a candle. Like this:

49:14.371 --> 49:18.374
Walter, the astronaut guy
is wrecking Dad's couch.

49:25.590 --> 49:26.632
Come on.

49:32.639 --> 49:34.223
That's Dad's nap couch.

49:48.905 --> 49:50.823
You wanna help me
get this out of here?

50:10.218 --> 50:13.637
Hit it.

50:13.805 --> 50:16.432
- What's happening?
- Come on.

50:16.599 --> 50:18.767
Take it.

50:18.935 --> 50:22.354
Follow it.

50:25.692 --> 50:27.401
There you go.

50:28.069 --> 50:29.737
That's it.

50:38.246 --> 50:40.205
Zorgons.

50:40.373 --> 50:42.499
They're big, gnarly lizards.

50:42.667 --> 50:44.752
Cold-blooded heatseekers.

50:45.587 --> 50:49.173
And the tiniest spark of warmth
will bring them in like moths.

50:49.341 --> 50:50.841
Flying all around the galaxy...

50:51.009 --> 50:53.302
...looking for anything to burn up.

50:53.511 --> 50:55.637
Why don't they just burn up
their own planet?

50:55.805 --> 50:57.431
Oh, they already did.

50:57.599 --> 50:59.141
That's not even the worst of it.

50:59.893 --> 51:02.853
The real problem
is their ravenous appetite.

51:03.021 --> 51:04.563
They never stop eating.

51:04.898 --> 51:06.148
What do they eat?

51:06.566 --> 51:09.610
- Meat.
- That's good.

51:10.820 --> 51:13.989
Dude, you're meat.

51:43.103 --> 51:45.688
Are you doing this
to keep Zorgons away?

51:47.190 --> 51:48.774
Nope.

51:49.484 --> 51:53.112
I'm doing this because I've been
eating paste out of a tube for 15 years.

52:12.340 --> 52:15.175
- This totally sucks.
- Why?

52:15.343 --> 52:17.011
He's eating all our food.

52:17.178 --> 52:20.097
So? Lupe just went shopping.

52:20.265 --> 52:22.433
How long do you think
we're gonna be out here?

52:22.600 --> 52:24.268
It could be weeks. Then what?

52:24.436 --> 52:26.020
I don't know.

52:26.187 --> 52:29.565
What about air? How long is it gonna
last before he breathes it all up?

52:31.568 --> 52:34.111
- I guess.
- I'm gonna say something.

52:34.279 --> 52:37.031
No, wait. Walter. Walter.

52:39.200 --> 52:41.368
Dude, that's our food.

52:41.911 --> 52:45.831
Yep. And you're running low
on supplies.

52:45.999 --> 52:48.250
Yeah, I know. You're eating it all.

52:50.086 --> 52:53.964
Well, as I recall, the card said,
"Rescue stranded astronaut."

52:54.132 --> 52:57.092
Looks to me like I'm the only one
that's doing any rescuing...

52:57.260 --> 53:01.013
...so I don't think a couple Dagwood
sandwiches is too much to ask for.

53:01.348 --> 53:03.474
Dog, you're eating it all.

53:05.393 --> 53:08.312
I passed through a time sphincter
to get here.

53:08.480 --> 53:10.272
You realize how difficult that is?

53:10.565 --> 53:12.024
What's a time sphincter?

53:12.192 --> 53:15.277
A wormhole, about yay big:

53:15.737 --> 53:17.071
You squeeze through there...

53:17.238 --> 53:20.199
...and tell me you're not
hungry enough to eat a carpet shark.

53:20.950 --> 53:23.535
Sounds like you got a long trip
ahead of you.

53:24.662 --> 53:26.288
Oh, you telling me to leave?

53:26.456 --> 53:30.292
Well, I mean, once you get
finished eating, yeah.

53:31.127 --> 53:33.629
I hate to break it to you,
but that's not your call.

53:34.005 --> 53:37.132
He spun me, so it's up to him.

53:41.054 --> 53:43.806
I'm fleet admiral,
and I'm telling you to hit the road.

53:48.895 --> 53:52.439
I apologize, sir. I didn't... I didn't
realize you were a fleet admiral.

53:54.150 --> 53:55.818
In fact, I...

53:56.861 --> 53:58.153
I'm a fleet admiral too.

53:59.656 --> 54:01.782
It's just a card, bug nuts.

54:02.784 --> 54:04.993
Well, he wants you to leave too.

54:05.161 --> 54:06.995
That true, Danny?
You want me to split?

54:07.163 --> 54:08.997
- Of course he does.
- Hey, mouthpiece...

54:09.165 --> 54:12.501
...let him answer, all right?
I need to hear it from the big guy.

54:13.503 --> 54:15.087
Well...

54:15.463 --> 54:17.256
Danny, tell him
you want him to leave.

54:17.424 --> 54:20.509
Well, he did help out a little.

54:20.677 --> 54:23.637
Help? He burned our couch
and now he's eating all our food.

54:23.805 --> 54:25.097
You call that helping?

54:26.182 --> 54:28.100
You know what?

54:28.643 --> 54:31.770
I'm just gonna go.
I feel like a third wheel anyways.

54:31.938 --> 54:35.274
I mean, you guys are such a tight,
unified team here.

54:35.442 --> 54:40.654
You're doing great too. I gotta tell you,
the house looks fantastic.

54:40.822 --> 54:42.573
So I'll just get out of your hair...

54:42.741 --> 54:46.535
...and let you guys whomp
some more Zorgon butt without me.

54:46.745 --> 54:48.537
Wait.

54:48.705 --> 54:50.497
Whose brother are you,
his or mine?

55:02.385 --> 55:03.635
You can stay.

55:07.265 --> 55:09.600
Orders are orders.

55:09.768 --> 55:12.644
Come on, admiral, your turn.

55:17.233 --> 55:19.485
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

55:19.652 --> 55:20.903
I think he can help.

55:28.495 --> 55:31.955
Okay. Why haven't
you guys started yet?

55:32.123 --> 55:33.374
We're waiting for you.

55:33.541 --> 55:36.543
Okay, well, I'm here,
so turn that clockwise...

55:36.711 --> 55:39.546
- Yeah, I know how to play the game.
- Okay.

55:42.550 --> 55:44.218
Hang on a second.
Something's wrong.

55:44.386 --> 55:45.427
What?

55:47.013 --> 55:48.263
I was ahead of you.

55:49.974 --> 55:52.434
Somebody must have
kicked the board?

55:52.602 --> 55:53.977
No, nobody kicked the board.

55:54.145 --> 55:55.729
- You cheated.
- No, I didn't.

55:55.897 --> 55:57.398
You cheated.
I knew you'd cheat.

55:57.565 --> 55:59.942
- "Cheater's" a strong word.
- I didn't cheat.

56:00.110 --> 56:02.277
- I didn't cheat!
- Guys, guys. Please.

56:02.445 --> 56:06.073
Bring it down. Indoor voices.
Now, did you move the piece?

56:07.701 --> 56:12.913
Maybe I moved the piece
by an accident.

56:13.081 --> 56:14.873
Okay. It was an accident.

56:15.041 --> 56:16.625
How can you move a piece
by accident?

56:16.793 --> 56:19.128
It's stuck to the game.
It's impossible. You cheated.

56:19.295 --> 56:22.297
No, no, no, let's not use that word.
No, stop saying "cheated."

56:22.465 --> 56:25.134
- You cheated! Cheater!
- I didn't cheat!

56:25.301 --> 56:29.304
Come on. Okay?
Now, where did you move from?

56:29.472 --> 56:31.473
I was right here.

56:31.641 --> 56:34.643
No, you weren't.
You were back there.

56:34.811 --> 56:36.603
Okay.

56:37.063 --> 56:38.731
Okay. Here, careful.

56:40.650 --> 56:42.901
- God.
- Okay, it's fixed.

56:43.069 --> 56:44.903
- You're such a baby.
- I'm not a baby.

56:45.071 --> 56:46.238
Slow down. Slow down.

56:46.406 --> 56:47.906
- I'm not a baby.
- You're a baby.

56:48.074 --> 56:49.324
Nobody is a baby here.

56:49.492 --> 56:51.493
- I am not a baby!
- You're a little baby!

56:51.661 --> 56:53.328
I'm not a baby!

56:53.830 --> 56:57.333
Jeez, it won't stop! Please.

56:57.751 --> 56:59.668
Okay, let's play the game.

56:59.836 --> 57:01.462
Fine.

57:08.303 --> 57:10.012
Won't stop spinning.

57:12.182 --> 57:14.183
- What's wrong with it?
- You broke it.

57:14.851 --> 57:17.770
Oh, look, there's the card.
See? It fixed itself.

57:19.898 --> 57:22.858
"Caught cheating.
Automatic ejection"?

57:23.777 --> 57:26.487
- Does it mean me?
- Well, you did move the piece.

57:26.654 --> 57:27.863
He's the one who cheated.

57:32.535 --> 57:35.204
Walter!

57:41.503 --> 57:43.545
Hang on, Walter!

57:44.255 --> 57:46.006
I'll save you.

57:46.925 --> 57:47.966
Help!

57:49.344 --> 57:51.887
Wait a minute! I got an idea!

57:59.187 --> 58:01.355
I'm gonna swing
this lamp up to you...

58:01.523 --> 58:03.857
...and you grab it,
and I'll pull you down.

58:04.025 --> 58:05.359
I can't hang on any longer!

58:11.074 --> 58:13.867
Don't worry, I'll get another lamp.

58:15.912 --> 58:17.496
Stand back.

58:36.808 --> 58:38.809
Walter?

58:46.234 --> 58:48.027
Walter.

58:56.286 --> 58:58.287
Oh, no.

59:14.346 --> 59:16.096
You okay?

59:17.891 --> 59:19.767
Are you okay?

59:22.479 --> 59:24.188
Get away from me.

59:27.442 --> 59:28.984
Sorry.

59:29.152 --> 59:31.528
Don't talk to me till we get home.

59:34.449 --> 59:35.949
That look cool from down here?

59:36.117 --> 59:38.410
Because up there it was...
It was pretty intense.

59:38.578 --> 59:42.164
My heart's pumping pretty good.
That was fun.

59:42.332 --> 59:45.626
Can you just play so I can get
out of here and get away from you?

59:45.794 --> 59:48.671
- I told him I was sorry.
- Whatever.

59:48.838 --> 59:50.422
Okay, you know what
we need to do?

59:50.590 --> 59:52.341
We need to get
our heads right, okay?

59:52.509 --> 59:55.010
Pull it together. As a team.

59:55.178 --> 59:56.428
The three of us.

59:57.138 --> 59:59.473
You're up, big man. Bring us home.

59:59.891 --> 01:00:02.518
I got you, buddy. I promise.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.875
- What's it say?
- He can't read.

01:00:30.672 --> 01:00:32.965
"Lose map of galaxy.
Go back two spaces."

01:00:47.022 --> 01:00:48.564
I'm freezing my ass off.

01:00:49.065 --> 01:00:52.484
Forty degrees? Those savages.

01:01:08.543 --> 01:01:10.753
Yes. Nine.

01:01:11.379 --> 01:01:14.089
- Good roll.
- Good roll?

01:01:14.257 --> 01:01:17.009
- Nine's a great roll.
- I meant great.

01:01:19.971 --> 01:01:21.555
It's gold.

01:01:26.561 --> 01:01:29.271
"Shooting star.
Make a wish as it passes."

01:01:29.939 --> 01:01:32.274
That's gotta be the best card
in the whole game.

01:01:32.442 --> 01:01:35.444
I'm almost to the end, look.
A few more and I win.

01:01:35.612 --> 01:01:38.280
I hope you win.
I don't care who wins.

01:01:38.448 --> 01:01:40.616
- Because you never win at anything.
- Hey.

01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:42.618
That's why he cheats,
he can never win.

01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:43.994
- No, I don't.
- You do.

01:01:44.162 --> 01:01:45.746
And you almost got me killed.

01:01:45.914 --> 01:01:48.582
- It wasn't my fault.
- It's not your fault?

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:51.377
How is it not your fault?
This is all your fault.

01:01:51.544 --> 01:01:53.003
Everything's your fault.

01:01:53.213 --> 01:01:54.838
It's your fault Mom and Dad
got divorced.

01:01:55.006 --> 01:01:57.299
- Hey.
- You suck.

01:01:59.094 --> 01:02:00.594
Danny.

01:02:08.353 --> 01:02:10.771
I get my wish now, don't I?

01:02:11.815 --> 01:02:13.315
Yeah.

01:02:28.957 --> 01:02:30.499
Don't do it.

01:02:31.918 --> 01:02:33.919
Don't do what?

01:02:34.087 --> 01:02:35.838
Don't wish what you're thinking.

01:02:36.006 --> 01:02:37.840
You don't know what I'm thinking.

01:02:38.008 --> 01:02:39.842
Yeah, well, I can tell it ain't good.

01:02:44.097 --> 01:02:47.599
Listen. No matter how good an idea
seems like when you're angry...

01:02:47.767 --> 01:02:50.394
...it never is. You gotta trust me
on this one, Walter.

01:03:06.619 --> 01:03:08.037
What'd you wish for?

01:03:08.204 --> 01:03:10.497
- I can't tell you.
- Tell me.

01:03:10.665 --> 01:03:13.375
You know the rules about wishing.
lf I told you, it won't...

01:03:13.543 --> 01:03:14.877
Tell me what you wished for.

01:03:15.045 --> 01:03:16.920
Get off me.

01:03:19.632 --> 01:03:23.844
Danny.

01:03:35.607 --> 01:03:37.649
The card worked.

01:03:37.817 --> 01:03:41.236
Yeah. It worked, congratulations.

01:03:41.404 --> 01:03:44.239
We're stuck in space now forever.

01:03:45.116 --> 01:03:46.408
Leave him alone.

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:54.083
What did you wish for?

01:03:55.585 --> 01:03:59.004
- This.
- You wished for a football?

01:03:59.422 --> 01:04:01.757
Signed by Brett Favre.

01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:03.592
Why'd you wish for a football?

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.678
You could have
just wished the game over.

01:04:05.845 --> 01:04:07.554
You could have wished us
out of here.

01:04:07.722 --> 01:04:11.350
I was under a lot of pressure.
He was yelling at me.

01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:15.396
Why were you yelling at him?

01:04:20.193 --> 01:04:22.486
Okay, guys.

01:04:22.654 --> 01:04:24.530
Here's the thing.

01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:28.742
I've played this game before.

01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:33.247
Okay? I played it
with my own brother 15 years ago.

01:04:33.707 --> 01:04:37.292
- You're a player?
- Yeah. Just like you guys.

01:04:37.794 --> 01:04:40.170
We were fighting a lot back then.

01:04:40.338 --> 01:04:43.257
And when the game started,
it got even worse.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:47.553
Every time we spun, we got madder
and madder at one another.

01:04:47.721 --> 01:04:50.222
And then I landed on the star space.

01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:52.266
The same one
that Walter just landed on.

01:04:53.101 --> 01:04:58.147
Well, I was so mad at him,
that when the star passed...

01:04:59.149 --> 01:05:01.108
...I made my wish.

01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:03.485
What'd you wish for?

01:05:04.487 --> 01:05:06.613
I wished that my brother
had never been born.

01:05:07.407 --> 01:05:08.991
Oh, my God.

01:05:09.159 --> 01:05:11.035
Soon as I did it, I felt horrible.

01:05:11.202 --> 01:05:13.412
I thought, you know,
if I could spin again...

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:17.499
...maybe I... I could land on another
star space and... And wish him back.

01:05:17.667 --> 01:05:19.835
But the game wouldn't let me...

01:05:20.837 --> 01:05:22.588
...because it wasn't my turn.

01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:25.299
Walter.

01:05:25.675 --> 01:05:27.676
There are some games...

01:05:27.844 --> 01:05:30.012
...you can't play alone.

01:05:31.556 --> 01:05:32.973
So, what do we do now?

01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:37.269
We go back downstairs and
we finish this thing once and for all.

01:05:37.437 --> 01:05:39.855
No more cheating.
No more arguing.

01:05:40.023 --> 01:05:43.025
All you guys have to do
is spin a few more times.

01:05:43.193 --> 01:05:45.444
I'll help you fight off
whatever comes out.

01:05:45.612 --> 01:05:47.279
Deal?

01:05:47.447 --> 01:05:50.115
- Deal.
- Deal.

01:05:51.576 --> 01:05:52.868
Is it getting hot in here?

01:05:55.372 --> 01:05:57.956
You blew out the pilot light
on the furnace, right?

01:06:03.713 --> 01:06:05.673
Stay put.

01:06:25.777 --> 01:06:27.403
Zorgons.

01:06:28.738 --> 01:06:31.824
My gerbil was in there.

01:06:31.991 --> 01:06:34.159
This is bad.

01:06:34.327 --> 01:06:35.911
This is very bad.

01:06:36.579 --> 01:06:38.831
Why? We didn't get eaten.

01:06:38.998 --> 01:06:40.708
Where did you leave the game?

01:06:43.294 --> 01:06:45.879
In the living room.

01:06:46.047 --> 01:06:47.631
Great.

01:06:47.799 --> 01:06:51.427
The game's our only way home,
and now the Zorgons are burning it.

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:54.555
There is one thing we can do.

01:07:00.103 --> 01:07:01.937
Waiting for an invitation?
Come on.

01:07:12.615 --> 01:07:15.075
- Put your back into it.
- Come on.

01:07:17.704 --> 01:07:19.955
Why are we doing this?

01:07:40.769 --> 01:07:42.644
Walter?

01:07:53.823 --> 01:07:56.325
You guys actually
set the house on fire!

01:07:56.493 --> 01:07:58.660
- Lisa's back.
- Lisa's unfrozen.

01:07:58.828 --> 01:08:01.163
You're okay. You're okay, Lisa.

01:08:01.331 --> 01:08:04.667
Get off me! Get off me!
Try and find the fire extinguisher!

01:08:04.834 --> 01:08:07.670
- No, Lisa, wait. No, Lisa, wait.
- No, Lisa, no.

01:08:07.837 --> 01:08:10.798
- Stop! Lisa, don't.
- The Zorgons are attracted to fire.

01:08:10.965 --> 01:08:12.299
Lisa, stop.

01:08:12.467 --> 01:08:13.509
No, Lisa, don't do it!

01:08:13.677 --> 01:08:15.803
Lisa, don't do that.
We gotta keep the fire.

01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:19.765
- The Zorgons are attracted to fire!
- Lisa, wait. No, Lisa, don't do it.

01:08:19.974 --> 01:08:21.475
No, Lisa.

01:08:24.104 --> 01:08:26.979
- Great.
- Now we'll never get the game back.

01:08:27.148 --> 01:08:31.026
Okay. Don't worry. They're back.

01:08:31.361 --> 01:08:34.446
- Who the hell are you?
- The astronaut.

01:08:34.656 --> 01:08:36.698
From the game we're in.

01:08:36.866 --> 01:08:38.408
Danny spun me.

01:08:47.335 --> 01:08:50.629
What is that? What is that?

01:08:51.131 --> 01:08:52.840
What's going on? Where are we?

01:08:53.716 --> 01:08:56.343
Somebody please
talk to me right now!

01:08:57.554 --> 01:09:01.473
All right, they're arming the harpoons.
They're gonna board us.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.642
- What's gonna board us?
- Guys, look alive.

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.644
- What's gonna board us?
- The Zorgons.

01:09:05.812 --> 01:09:08.939
- What's a Zorgon?
- They're lizard-men. They eat meat.

01:09:09.107 --> 01:09:10.566
We're meat!

01:09:16.281 --> 01:09:19.408
- Come on, let's hide downstairs!
- Okay, listen, when they dock...

01:09:19.576 --> 01:09:22.118
...I'll sneak on the ship and
steal the game. Got it?

01:09:22.287 --> 01:09:23.453
- Hang on.
- What?

01:09:23.621 --> 01:09:26.457
- Did she say downstairs?
- Oh, no.

01:09:38.928 --> 01:09:39.970
Hey, hey.

01:09:40.388 --> 01:09:42.930
Just stay with us,
and everything will be okay.

01:09:47.103 --> 01:09:48.437
I'll never leave you.

01:09:54.986 --> 01:09:56.904
Move, move, move.

01:10:00.617 --> 01:10:02.284
Go, go.

01:10:40.407 --> 01:10:43.701
Okay. It's gotten
pretty serious out there.

01:10:43.868 --> 01:10:45.786
I need you guys to hide in here.

01:10:45.954 --> 01:10:47.788
I'll keep in touch with these.

01:10:47.956 --> 01:10:49.540
They won't work.
Danny broke them.

01:10:49.708 --> 01:10:52.751
He pulled off the antenna.
They're completely destroyed.

01:10:54.629 --> 01:10:56.296
Testing.

01:10:57.007 --> 01:10:58.716
It works.

01:10:59.092 --> 01:11:01.844
Listen, keep the volume low.

01:11:02.012 --> 01:11:03.512
Only use that if you need me.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:06.348
Wa... Wait, where are you going?

01:11:06.516 --> 01:11:08.642
I'm gonna go find the game.

01:11:19.195 --> 01:11:21.530
He has gorgeous eyes.

01:11:24.409 --> 01:11:25.868
What?

01:11:26.703 --> 01:11:29.663
He obviously feels
very protective over me.

01:11:30.665 --> 01:11:32.333
I just...

01:11:32.625 --> 01:11:34.376
I just feel so safe around him.

01:11:35.128 --> 01:11:36.670
Zorgons.

01:11:36.838 --> 01:11:38.297
Oh, my God.

01:11:38.465 --> 01:11:42.134
The place is crawling with them.
They're all over the basement.

01:11:42.302 --> 01:11:46.013
Wait, I think in the corner
I see the game.

01:11:46.181 --> 01:11:47.806
Yeah, the box is right there.

01:11:48.224 --> 01:11:51.560
Hang on, I'm... I'm gonna get closer.

01:11:54.064 --> 01:11:55.230
Did he get the game?

01:12:02.822 --> 01:12:05.366
- Hello?
- What's going on?

01:12:05.533 --> 01:12:07.076
Are you there? Hello?

01:12:07.243 --> 01:12:09.328
- What's happening?
- Hello?

01:12:09.496 --> 01:12:10.746
Is he dead?

01:12:45.365 --> 01:12:47.616
The game was right there.

01:12:48.618 --> 01:12:51.620
It was right across from the furnace.
I couldn't get it.

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:55.416
There's too many of them down there.
They're all over the basement.

01:12:55.792 --> 01:12:57.626
Are there any upstairs?

01:12:57.794 --> 01:13:00.337
Not yet. But as soon as
they're done down there...

01:13:00.505 --> 01:13:02.423
It's okay. You tried your hardest.

01:13:03.049 --> 01:13:05.134
- We believe in you.
- Will you please?

01:13:07.053 --> 01:13:08.429
Okay.

01:13:08.763 --> 01:13:11.640
- The dumbwaiter.
- What?

01:13:11.933 --> 01:13:14.476
The dumbwaiter is across
from the furnace.

01:13:14.644 --> 01:13:16.311
It's a little elevator.

01:13:16.855 --> 01:13:18.731
You could sneak right in it...

01:13:19.024 --> 01:13:20.816
...we'll lower you down...

01:13:21.234 --> 01:13:22.776
...you could grab the game...

01:13:22.944 --> 01:13:24.987
...and we'll pull you right back up.

01:13:25.613 --> 01:13:27.156
So easy.

01:13:27.323 --> 01:13:28.991
Right, Walter?

01:13:29.159 --> 01:13:31.452
Yeah, but he's too big.

01:13:31.995 --> 01:13:33.829
Yeah.

01:13:33.997 --> 01:13:35.831
It was a good plan, though.

01:13:36.207 --> 01:13:37.583
It was a great plan.

01:13:37.751 --> 01:13:39.001
Yeah, it was.

01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:40.586
It was.

01:13:40.754 --> 01:13:42.921
Too bad he wouldn't fit.

01:13:43.089 --> 01:13:45.341
I wouldn't even fit.

01:13:49.721 --> 01:13:53.015
I sure wish we knew someone
that was small enough.

01:13:53.975 --> 01:13:57.186
Do we really need the game?

01:14:07.447 --> 01:14:09.656
How you doing in there?

01:14:11.534 --> 01:14:12.951
Okay.

01:14:13.119 --> 01:14:16.372
Listen to me.
It's gonna be real easy, okay?

01:14:16.539 --> 01:14:20.042
Just gonna lower you down there,
grab the game, and we'll pull you up.

01:14:20.585 --> 01:14:21.835
Yeah.

01:14:22.003 --> 01:14:24.254
Nothing's gonna happen
to you, okay?

01:14:24.422 --> 01:14:26.799
- Yeah.
- Because I'm your brother.

01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:29.426
And that's what
being a brother means.

01:14:29.803 --> 01:14:31.887
Means I'll never let
anything happen to you.

01:14:32.055 --> 01:14:35.182
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:14:35.725 --> 01:14:38.852
Okay. This is just gonna
take a few seconds, okay?

01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:41.814
- Hey, Walter?
- Yeah?

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.400
I'm sorry I cheated.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.568
I know.

01:14:52.158 --> 01:14:55.202
- You ready to do this?
- I'm ready.

01:15:52.218 --> 01:15:54.595
He's right there.

01:15:54.763 --> 01:15:58.057
Guys, why did you stop?

01:16:10.987 --> 01:16:13.822
Guys, come on.

01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:16.075
I'm not at the bottom yet.

01:16:26.461 --> 01:16:28.170
Help me. Come on.

01:16:30.173 --> 01:16:32.424
That's it. Pull, pull.
Come on, come on.

01:16:32.592 --> 01:16:34.468
Go. Go.

01:16:40.975 --> 01:16:44.019
They're back.
They're coming up the stairs.

01:16:44.187 --> 01:16:46.230
Get out of here. Go on.

01:16:46.398 --> 01:16:47.773
Go, go, go.

01:17:34.612 --> 01:17:36.030
Oh, no.

01:18:19.074 --> 01:18:20.491
Guys.

01:18:20.658 --> 01:18:23.494
It was just the box.

01:18:35.048 --> 01:18:38.592
Wait. I see the game.

01:18:39.094 --> 01:18:41.470
It's on the Zorgon ship.

01:18:45.975 --> 01:18:48.936
But I think I can get it.

01:18:50.271 --> 01:18:52.981
Danny, do not get on that ship.

01:18:53.149 --> 01:18:55.484
Just stay put.
We'll come and get you.

01:19:53.543 --> 01:19:55.127
Danny.

01:19:56.254 --> 01:19:57.713
Danny. Danny, listen to me.

01:19:57.881 --> 01:20:00.632
The Zorgons are up here.
Just stay put.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.801
The pulley broke...
- figure out...

01:20:02.969 --> 01:20:06.180
We got rope... So just stay put.

01:20:07.182 --> 01:20:09.475
Danny. Danny, are you there?

01:20:09.642 --> 01:20:11.435
Danny, the Zorgons are up here.

01:20:11.603 --> 01:20:13.354
lf you can hear me, listen.

01:20:13.521 --> 01:20:17.149
We're not pulling you up right now.
Stay put.

01:20:17.317 --> 01:20:19.026
We just saw one. Hold tight.

01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:57.439
It's just a goat. It's just a goat.

01:20:57.857 --> 01:20:59.775
It's just a...

01:21:00.443 --> 01:21:03.612
It's not a goat. It's not a goat.
It's not a goat.

01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:06.323
It's not a goat. It's not a goat.

01:21:06.491 --> 01:21:11.412
It's not a goat.

01:22:50.011 --> 01:22:52.221
Guys, pull me up.

01:22:55.308 --> 01:22:58.727
They got goats with four eyes.

01:23:47.569 --> 01:23:49.028
Guys! Quick!

01:23:49.195 --> 01:23:51.196
I have the game!

01:23:52.741 --> 01:23:54.283
Come on.

01:23:55.535 --> 01:23:56.952
Walter.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.706
I told you I wouldn't let anything
happen to you. Come on.

01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:24.188
Emergency.

01:24:27.442 --> 01:24:29.318
Alien life form.

01:24:29.486 --> 01:24:31.445
Must destroy.

01:24:31.613 --> 01:24:33.822
He still wants to kill me.

01:24:40.288 --> 01:24:43.248
Use the card. Quick.

01:24:43.416 --> 01:24:45.167
Reprogram.

01:25:03.687 --> 01:25:05.521
Alien life form.

01:25:08.191 --> 01:25:09.983
Must destroy.

01:25:38.388 --> 01:25:39.972
Alien life form.

01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:42.349
Must destroy.

01:25:46.688 --> 01:25:50.107
Guess that's what
the reprogram card's for.

01:25:50.275 --> 01:25:52.192
I like that card.

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.403
It's a good card.

01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:57.656
Where's Lisa?

01:26:03.371 --> 01:26:04.705
Lisa...

01:26:04.873 --> 01:26:06.373
...is upstairs.

01:26:06.541 --> 01:26:08.417
What fell?

01:26:11.421 --> 01:26:15.049
Little excessive, but I like it.
Come on.

01:26:15.759 --> 01:26:17.760
Come on, come on, come on.

01:26:25.101 --> 01:26:26.393
Okay, spin it, buddy.

01:26:35.945 --> 01:26:37.780
Almost there.

01:26:41.868 --> 01:26:43.327
I got it.

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:47.289
"Flunk space academy.
Go back one space."

01:26:51.211 --> 01:26:53.295
I'm not even gonna
comment on that.

01:26:56.132 --> 01:26:57.466
My turn.

01:27:16.152 --> 01:27:19.154
"Hit time warp. Go back three
spaces. Repeat last turn."

01:27:29.249 --> 01:27:31.000
I get another wish.

01:27:50.937 --> 01:27:52.771
Thanks for helping us out.

01:28:03.908 --> 01:28:07.661
I wish the astronaut
had his brother back.

01:28:35.148 --> 01:28:37.399
You wished for two of me?

01:28:37.567 --> 01:28:38.817
No. I...

01:28:38.985 --> 01:28:41.403
I wished the astronaut guy
had his brother back.

01:28:48.703 --> 01:28:51.246
- Danny.
- Who are you?

01:28:51.748 --> 01:28:53.415
It's me.

01:28:53.917 --> 01:28:56.835
It's Walter. I'm your brother.

01:28:57.003 --> 01:28:59.088
- What?
- Wha...?

01:28:59.255 --> 01:29:01.340
No, you're not.

01:29:01.508 --> 01:29:02.883
He is.

01:29:03.802 --> 01:29:05.260
Yes.

01:29:05.428 --> 01:29:08.222
I'm older, but I'm him.

01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:11.183
- I came back for you.
- What's going on here?

01:29:57.981 --> 01:30:00.149
That was awesome.

01:30:08.658 --> 01:30:10.200
Thank you.

01:30:10.994 --> 01:30:12.369
l...

01:30:12.537 --> 01:30:14.496
- I didn't...
- You did a good job.

01:30:15.123 --> 01:30:17.124
You did better than I did.

01:30:18.251 --> 01:30:19.585
Thanks.

01:30:20.086 --> 01:30:22.421
Now, make sure
he gets home safe, okay?

01:30:23.298 --> 01:30:24.757
Okay.

01:30:53.828 --> 01:30:56.205
- He was me.
- Yeah.

01:30:56.373 --> 01:30:58.540
Oh, my God. And I wanted to...

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:18.894
Ten. You need 10 to win.

01:31:19.187 --> 01:31:21.313
Need a 10. Need a 10.

01:31:33.243 --> 01:31:35.828
One. God, I suck.

01:31:45.171 --> 01:31:48.340
"Would you like to swing on a star?
Move ahead nine spaces."

01:31:50.593 --> 01:31:52.511
- Danny, you won.
- I won?

01:31:52.679 --> 01:31:55.097
- He won?
- You won, Danny. You beat the game.

01:31:55.265 --> 01:31:57.099
You won the game.
We can go home.

01:31:57.267 --> 01:31:58.934
I reached Zathura!

01:32:40.393 --> 01:32:43.729
"Game over.
Thank you for playing"?

01:32:44.356 --> 01:32:47.149
- That's it?
- Now what?

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:06.835
I think we're home.

01:33:11.299 --> 01:33:13.008
Walter!

01:33:17.555 --> 01:33:19.473
Lisa!

01:33:28.608 --> 01:33:31.026
It's a black hole!

01:33:31.194 --> 01:33:34.154
Zathura is a black hole!

01:34:10.859 --> 01:34:12.568
Danny!

01:34:15.321 --> 01:34:20.951
No!

01:34:23.163 --> 01:34:25.247
Two-run shot. Are you kidding me?

01:34:25.415 --> 01:34:28.625
A's up 5-4. Keith Foulke
leads the bigs in home runs...

01:34:28.793 --> 01:34:30.836
...given up by a reliever with six.

01:34:31.004 --> 01:34:32.963
Bottom nine. Red Sox down, 5-4.

01:34:33.131 --> 01:34:37.009
Octavio Dotel in for the save.
He ain't really saving a whole lot.

01:34:37.177 --> 01:34:38.927
He walks "Big Papi" Ortiz...

01:34:39.095 --> 01:34:41.972
...to tie up the inning.
Kevin Millar up next.

01:34:42.891 --> 01:34:45.100
After an Ortiz walk, ninth inning...

01:34:46.686 --> 01:34:48.270
Walter?

01:34:49.064 --> 01:34:51.982
- Don't push that button.
- Let's get back to the here and now.

01:34:52.150 --> 01:34:54.151
No way it's gonna
happen again, is it?

01:34:54.319 --> 01:34:55.986
No way.
No, it doesn't happen again.

01:34:56.154 --> 01:34:58.280
Millar pops out to left field.

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:13.128
Richard's back!

01:35:13.296 --> 01:35:15.047
- I did it.
- You won the game.

01:35:15.215 --> 01:35:17.591
- I won the game. I beat Zathura.
- We're home.

01:35:17.759 --> 01:35:19.551
- We're home!
- We did it. We're home.

01:35:19.719 --> 01:35:22.638
I distinctly remember asking you guys
not to kill each other.

01:35:22.806 --> 01:35:25.099
Dad, it was so awesome.
There was this game...

01:35:25.266 --> 01:35:27.976
...it sent us to outer space.
- There was a black hole.

01:35:28.144 --> 01:35:29.645
We almost had to stay forever.

01:35:29.813 --> 01:35:33.023
- I stole the game from the Zorgons.
- And I saw myself older.

01:35:34.109 --> 01:35:35.693
Sounds like a lot of fun.

01:35:35.902 --> 01:35:38.404
It's almost 3:00,
and Mom's gonna be here any minute.

01:35:38.571 --> 01:35:41.573
Grab all games and books,
whatever you wanna take to her house.

01:35:41.741 --> 01:35:43.575
Come on, get ready to go.

01:35:45.912 --> 01:35:49.123
Good throw. Right to the chest.
Catch this one.

01:35:50.542 --> 01:35:52.334
- Caught it.
- Nice.

01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:57.548
All right, ready? Here we go.

01:35:57.716 --> 01:36:01.093
Brett Favre takes the snap.
He's looking. It's a great pass.

01:36:01.886 --> 01:36:03.512
- Touchdown.
- Touchdown.

01:36:05.015 --> 01:36:07.099
- Just a second, Mom.
- Hey, Mom.

01:36:09.352 --> 01:36:12.021
What happened to the football
signed by Brett Favre?

01:36:12.188 --> 01:36:15.232
- It's gone.
- What happened to it?

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:17.026
It never happened.

01:36:17.193 --> 01:36:18.777
Oh, right.

01:36:20.989 --> 01:36:23.282
We never speak of this. Okay?

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.660
- Never happened.
- Never happened.

01:36:29.539 --> 01:36:31.790
Still think I have gorgeous eyes?

01:36:31.958 --> 01:36:34.543
- Walter.
- What?

01:36:35.305 --> 01:36:41.282
