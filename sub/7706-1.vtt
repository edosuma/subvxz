00:02.136 --> 00:04.436
The game of skleenball
is very simple, Brian.

00:04.438 --> 00:06.505
You just sling your anchovies

00:06.507 --> 00:08.607
into your opponent's
laundry basket.

00:11.679 --> 00:12.878
Aw, missed!

00:15.516 --> 00:18.484
Do we get to eat
the anchovies after the game?

00:18.486 --> 00:22.121
No! Does Marvin Haggler eat
his trunks after a fight?

00:23.557 --> 00:27.626
Okay, who dumped my clean
laundry out on the floor?

00:27.628 --> 00:29.028
Brian.

00:29.030 --> 00:30.996
Well, ALF told me to.

00:30.998 --> 00:33.732
I did it so
we could play skleenball.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.902
It's not nice
to rat on your friends.

00:36.904 --> 00:39.238
What's skleenball?

00:39.240 --> 00:41.907
A picture's worth
a thousand words.

00:47.148 --> 00:50.449
That picture
was worth a $1000.

00:51.886 --> 00:54.653
Well, maybe the frame
makes it look cheap.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.391
I am tired
of your breaking things.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.393
If this happens
one more time

01:01.395 --> 01:04.096
you will be living
in the garage.

01:04.098 --> 01:08.901
From now on, I'll treat this
house as if it were my own.

01:08.903 --> 01:11.103
Treat it as if
it were my house

01:11.105 --> 01:12.805
and don't break anything!

01:14.775 --> 01:15.908
Cheap frame!

01:17.678 --> 01:21.513
Well, I guess
it can be repaired.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.248
(ALF)
'Heads up!'

01:30.124 --> 01:31.490
Oops.

01:34.295 --> 01:37.529
[theme music]

01:55.049 --> 01:57.683
[music continues]

02:14.268 --> 02:16.969
[music continues]

02:35.356 --> 02:37.589
[instrumental music]

02:41.028 --> 02:42.594
Willie, I said I was sorry.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.297
How many times
do I have to say it?

02:45.299 --> 02:48.100
It's gotten to a point
where saying you're sorry

02:48.102 --> 02:49.134
is not enough.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.703
What if I write it down?

02:51.705 --> 02:54.706
- You don't get it, do you?
- Get what?

02:54.708 --> 02:58.210
This whole idea
of living together.

02:58.212 --> 03:01.280
You see, we make rules
and we follow them

03:01.282 --> 03:05.150
to keep our lives
from becoming chaos.

03:05.152 --> 03:07.386
Now, if anybody
breaks those rules

03:07.388 --> 03:10.556
'you or-or me, or anybody'

03:10.558 --> 03:14.393
'then life becomes impossible.'

03:14.395 --> 03:17.296
You're right.
I don't get it.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.566
Let me put it this way.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.969
You're staying in the garage
until we say you can get out.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.772
That I get.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.841
Let me ask you something.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.711
Did you act this way
in your parent's house?

03:32.713 --> 03:36.315
No. I lived
in their garage.

03:36.317 --> 03:39.585
Oh, sure! Draw parallels.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.588
Just think about
what I've said, okay?

03:42.590 --> 03:44.423
And we'll discuss it later.

03:44.425 --> 03:47.593
Willie, please.
You can't leave me out here.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.995
There are none
of the comforts of home.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.430
Well, alright.

03:51.432 --> 03:54.566
You can bring something
out from the house.

03:54.568 --> 03:58.003
Can it be something
that answers to "Hey, Lucky?"

03:59.406 --> 04:01.440
Just a thought.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.942
Wait, wait, wait, I want to ask
you something. It's important.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.010
What?

04:05.613 --> 04:06.812
Uhh..

04:07.615 --> 04:08.947
Uh..

04:10.918 --> 04:12.217
Goodbye, ALF.

04:12.219 --> 04:14.253
Oh, no, wait! Now I know
what I was gonna ask you.

04:14.255 --> 04:17.456
Instead of me wasting time
learning how to behave

04:17.458 --> 04:19.591
could I just suck up to Kate?

04:22.029 --> 04:24.863
Well, Kate and I agreed
about sending you out here.

04:24.865 --> 04:29.468
So, if anything, you're going to
have to suck up to both of us.

04:29.470 --> 04:33.472
Well, thanks.
I'll remember that. Handsome.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.542
[instrumental music]

04:49.089 --> 04:50.822
Willie!

04:50.824 --> 04:52.124
Willie!

04:55.562 --> 04:58.163
Our, our furniture!

04:58.165 --> 05:00.232
We've been robbed!

05:00.234 --> 05:02.467
[indistinct singing]

05:04.238 --> 05:06.004
Wishful thinking.

05:08.242 --> 05:12.177
¶ Stop in the name of love ¶

05:12.179 --> 05:15.914
¶ Before you break my heart ¶

05:15.916 --> 05:20.319
¶ Stop in the name of love ¶

05:20.321 --> 05:23.588
¶ Before you break my heart ¶

05:23.590 --> 05:27.159
¶ Think it over ¶¶

05:28.696 --> 05:29.928
Oh, hi.

05:29.930 --> 05:33.999
Oh, a housewarming gift.
How nice.

05:34.001 --> 05:37.336
Who told you you could bring
this furniture out here?

05:37.338 --> 05:39.371
Willie.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.939
I did not!

05:40.941 --> 05:43.175
You said I could bring
something from the house.

05:43.177 --> 05:47.446
I said you could bring
something. Not everything!

05:47.448 --> 05:51.450
Now, in all fairness, you did
not make that point clear.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.185
He did bring everything.

05:53.187 --> 05:56.321
I didn't take that hideous
Statue of Liberty clock.

05:56.323 --> 05:59.858
That clock was a gift
from my mother.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.062
Did I say hideous?

06:04.064 --> 06:07.799
I meant lovely.
As lovely as your mother.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.067
[ding]

06:09.069 --> 06:11.970
That must be the microwave.
Brisket anyone?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.873
Forget the brisket!

06:14.875 --> 06:17.376
ALF, I want you to take
everything back

06:17.378 --> 06:18.677
into the house tonight.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.413
And I emphasize
the word everything!

06:21.415 --> 06:23.749
And I emphasize
the word tonight!

06:23.751 --> 06:27.586
And if you don't, you will be
living out here permanently.

06:27.588 --> 06:30.722
I noticed you emphasize
the word permanently.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.393
Wait, don't go! Please.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.228
Can we sit down
and talk this out?

06:36.230 --> 06:37.829
Just give me one minute.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.199
Alright. Fine. Yes.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.367
You have one minute.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.102
Thank you.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.838
Hey, Willie, don't sit there.
That's my chair.

06:48.409 --> 06:49.941
That was my chair
in the house.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.077
Well, we're not in the house!

06:54.348 --> 06:55.781
Forty seconds.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.383
Well, that's not fair.
Willie talked, too!

06:58.385 --> 07:00.585
Penalize him!

07:00.587 --> 07:01.686
Thirty-five.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.622
What are you,
Mission control?

07:04.858 --> 07:06.792
- Thirty.
- Thirty seconds?

07:06.794 --> 07:09.528
I just had a minute
half a minute ago!

07:09.530 --> 07:13.432
[sighs]
Forget the minute.
Just say what you have to say!

07:13.434 --> 07:14.966
Uh.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.034
Uh..

07:16.970 --> 07:18.203
Uh..

07:20.040 --> 07:21.473
- Goodnight, ALF.
- Goodnight, ALF.

07:21.475 --> 07:25.644
No! No.
I need human companionship.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.646
I don't know how I ever
got along without it

07:27.648 --> 07:30.215
but now I'm hooked.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.317
I'm a people junkie.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.319
Please. Don't go.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.924
Oh, you go ahead, Kate.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.993
I'll sit out here
with him for a while.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.662
Willie, what are you doing?

07:44.631 --> 07:46.665
It seems like he
really misses us.

07:46.667 --> 07:49.167
I do, I do, I do.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.403
Willie, he's got
our furniture and our brisket

07:51.405 --> 07:53.505
now he's after us.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.640
Oh, you're right.
Of course, you're right.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.676
You're stayin' in the garage.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.745
Without us,
and without our brisket.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.013
Goodnight, ALF.

08:02.015 --> 08:05.183
Kate, wait, please!
Give me another chance.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.785
I know I could change.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.187
Just let me move back inside
for one week

08:09.189 --> 08:13.992
and I'll prove it to you.
I'll be on my best behavior.

08:13.994 --> 08:18.964
What if, during this week,
you don't change?

08:18.966 --> 08:21.700
Then, Willie and I will
move out here for good.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.537
Alright. You've got a deal.

08:25.539 --> 08:28.106
Kate, I don't want
to move out here.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.276
I didn't mean
that was part of..

08:31.278 --> 08:34.045
The deal is you stay
in the house for one week

08:34.047 --> 08:37.015
but if you mess up,
you're history.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.950
Hey, no problem!

08:38.952 --> 08:40.752
[crashing]

08:44.024 --> 08:45.924
The week hasn't
started yet, right?

08:46.560 --> 08:48.960
[instrumental music]

08:51.899 --> 08:54.900
Well, the furniture is back.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.736
Oh, and he's fixed
the painting.

08:57.738 --> 09:02.807
And everything seems so
much cleaner than usual.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.745
Uh, no offense.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.747
Good morning, sir.

09:08.749 --> 09:12.717
Madam, your eggs Benedict
is served.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.887
Oh, no!
He's using the stove again.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.723
He's wearing my shirt.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.592
My, that was fast.

09:20.594 --> 09:23.595
You two must be famished.

09:23.597 --> 09:26.531
ALF, what is going on?

09:26.533 --> 09:27.933
Going on, ma'am?

09:27.935 --> 09:30.368
Kate, this food looks great.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.770
Thank you, sir.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.406
I believe a meal should
be pleasing to the eye

09:34.408 --> 09:37.776
as well as to the palette.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.844
ALF, um,
just so that I know

09:39.846 --> 09:42.113
is the entire week
going to be filled

09:42.115 --> 09:46.117
with a lot of "sirs" and
"ma'ams" and haute cuisine?

09:46.119 --> 09:48.753
Well, ma'am, per our deal,
I wanted to show you

09:48.755 --> 09:52.857
how much it would
please me to please you.

09:52.859 --> 09:56.628
Well, thank you.
That's very nice.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.730
You know,
I appreciate that.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.565
I must admit
the eggs do look delicious

10:00.567 --> 10:03.034
and the house is very clean.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.704
It's amazingly clean.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.139
It's not that clean.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.874
I do hope you folks
will have a chance

10:09.876 --> 10:11.643
to check under the tables.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.812
I've scraped off
all the gum.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.081
There was gum
under the tables?

10:16.083 --> 10:19.451
Well, gum and other
crusty substances

10:19.453 --> 10:23.388
deposited there by someone who
will henceforth be known as

10:23.390 --> 10:25.457
"The old ALF."

10:25.459 --> 10:27.025
May he rest in peace.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.563
Mmm.
What smells so good?

10:31.565 --> 10:33.164
ALF, you look great.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.467
Did we have a cleaning crew
come in or something?

10:35.469 --> 10:36.968
The house looks fantastic.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.571
Oh, for crying out loud!

10:39.573 --> 10:41.172
ALF cleaned the whole house

10:41.174 --> 10:44.242
and he made us this
wonderful breakfast.

10:44.244 --> 10:47.245
Hmm. Tastes good.

10:47.247 --> 10:50.215
Better than that stinky stuff
mom usually makes, huh, Brian?

10:51.184 --> 10:52.384
Uh-huh.

10:54.488 --> 10:57.188
Wait a minute. I didn't think
ALF was allowed in the house.

10:57.190 --> 11:00.425
That was yesterday.
Today he's our butler.

11:00.427 --> 11:04.763
If you don't mind, madam,
I prefer the word "manservant."

11:04.765 --> 11:06.798
Helps keep me in my place.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.199
[knock on door]

11:08.201 --> 11:09.534
(Trevor)
'Hey, anybody home?'

11:09.536 --> 11:13.638
ALF. It's Trevor. You better..

11:13.640 --> 11:15.273
The new ALF moves fast!

11:16.810 --> 11:18.376
Uh, come on in, Trevor.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.647
Hi.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.949
Hey, Tanner,
who painted your fence?

11:24.951 --> 11:27.652
- It looks great!
- Oh, I don't know what..

11:27.654 --> 11:29.220
I don't what
you're talking abo..

11:29.222 --> 11:34.793
- Oh, wow! That does look great.
- Yeah. So who painted it?

11:34.795 --> 11:36.394
Uh..

11:36.396 --> 11:38.663
Happy birthday, dad.

11:38.665 --> 11:41.066
Oh, it's your
birthday present.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.235
I hope I didn't
ruin the surprise.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.403
Oh, no, no.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.839
I was going to look out
the window soon, anyway.

11:47.841 --> 11:51.142
- So, how old are you?
- I'll be 45 in August.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.380
That's six months away.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.249
It ain't your birthday.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.884
You just had
your fence painted

11:59.886 --> 12:02.854
so you can keep up
with the Ochmonek's.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.023
Well, I'm not
gonna tell you

12:05.025 --> 12:07.525
where I bought
my fluorescent flamingos.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.127
We blew it.

12:10.163 --> 12:13.331
Hey, Kate,
great looking breakfast.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.900
- Mom didn't make it.
- Who did?

12:15.902 --> 12:19.604
- Our manservant.
- You got a manservant?

12:19.606 --> 12:22.173
Just for the week.

12:22.175 --> 12:25.043
Well, do me a favor.
Don't mention it to Raquel.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.445
- You have our word.
- Thanks.

12:27.447 --> 12:31.249
She went ape when she found out
you had a vacuum cleaner.

12:31.251 --> 12:35.787
Hey, listen, you might have
Jeeves, give me a jingle.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.022
I might want him
to paint my flamingos.

12:38.692 --> 12:40.191
Will do.

12:42.295 --> 12:45.096
Oh, Jeeves.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.033
There's something
I'd like to ask you.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.637
I know what you're
going to say, sir.

12:52.639 --> 12:57.776
And I've already taken care
of those ghastly flamingos.

12:57.778 --> 12:58.877
You painted them?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.545
No, they've been removed.

13:00.547 --> 13:04.482
And tomorrow, I shall
terminate the lawn jockey.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.051
[instrumental music]

13:10.157 --> 13:12.157
Did you see
what ALF did in there?

13:12.159 --> 13:15.393
He embroidered "Milord
and Milady" on the towels.

13:16.663 --> 13:19.564
Yeah. He's amazing.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.166
You're telling me.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.502
He got that stubborn cranberry
stain off of my pajama tops.

13:25.505 --> 13:26.671
Yeah.

13:27.741 --> 13:28.973
He can do anything.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.509
Oh, yeah!

13:31.511 --> 13:33.178
I'll say.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.946
I can't believe I'm saying this

13:34.948 --> 13:39.017
but he, he's actually
making me feel..

13:39.019 --> 13:42.086
- Inadequate?
- I wasn't going to say that.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.354
Oh, I didn't mean..

13:43.356 --> 13:45.156
You're the one
who's making me feel inadequate

13:45.158 --> 13:46.624
and the kids too.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.827
I mean, everybody
is so carried away

13:48.829 --> 13:51.596
with the new ALF's
old world charm.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.199
Hope you're not
expecting that in me

13:54.201 --> 13:56.434
when things
get back to normal.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.037
Absolutely not..

14:00.373 --> 14:01.940
...Milady.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.446
Goodnight, Milord.

Morning, ma'am.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.099
ALF, it's your last day.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.101
There's no need to
wax the floor again.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.669
I'm free at the moment.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.939
And I've finished
shortening your dresses.

15:07.941 --> 15:10.208
You shortened my dresses?

15:10.210 --> 15:13.244
Well, they are showing
higher hemlines this year.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.380
And I didn't think
milady wanted to continue

15:15.382 --> 15:18.182
with the
"Nancy Reagan" look.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.686
Thank you, ALF Lauren.

15:22.789 --> 15:24.689
ALF Lauren?

15:24.691 --> 15:25.790
[laughing]

15:25.792 --> 15:27.425
Oh, good one, ma'am.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.595
I'll have to phone the other
manservants I've befriended

15:30.597 --> 15:34.299
and tell them that you've
unleashed yet another corker.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.802
Oh, brother.

15:37.804 --> 15:41.372
Uh, excuse me, ma'am,
but the wax isn't dry yet.

15:41.374 --> 15:45.043
If you must go into the kitchen,
I'll have to carry you.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.779
Thank you. I'll walk.

15:48.915 --> 15:51.049
I'll wax in your wake.

15:54.387 --> 15:57.989
Mom, how come you didn't
get a piggyback ride from ALF?

15:57.991 --> 15:59.557
I wasn't in the mood.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.693
What's that slop?

16:02.662 --> 16:04.495
It's eggs Florentine

16:04.497 --> 16:07.598
brushed with a
Mandarin orange glaze.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.735
How come we don't have anything
to drink except Perrier?

16:10.737 --> 16:13.471
ALF gets it at cost
from the French embassy.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.240
Oh, relax, Kate.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.743
We're gonna have
the old ALF back at sundown.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.278
I hope so.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.114
I don't want to take
any more quiche to school.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.350
Nobody will trade with me.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.752
Well, the week is over
as far as I'm concerned.

16:27.754 --> 16:30.088
I'm gonna have
a plain old orange.

16:41.701 --> 16:45.103
Willie, I don't think that
I can make it till sundown.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.172
Why don't we go
away for the day.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.842
- Good idea!
- Oh, come on, that's silly!

16:50.844 --> 16:52.977
Now, why don't we just
tell ALF that he's won?

16:52.979 --> 16:54.612
Well, I'm for that!
You've won!

16:55.648 --> 16:58.383
- Won, ma'am?
- The bet is off!

16:58.385 --> 17:00.818
You can turn in your whisk broom
and your phoney accent

17:00.820 --> 17:03.721
let out a big burp,
and get on with it!

17:03.723 --> 17:06.958
Yeah, ALF, let her rip!

17:06.960 --> 17:11.062
What we're saying is,
we want the old ALF back.

17:11.064 --> 17:15.233
Please, I must insist
that we follow this through.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.301
Isn't that
one of the rules?

17:17.303 --> 17:19.404
To follow things through?

17:19.406 --> 17:21.339
Otherwise, we'd have chaos.

17:21.341 --> 17:24.542
And our life
would be impossible.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.979
Alright, we're leaving.
We'll see you at 6:14.

17:27.981 --> 17:29.247
6:14?

17:29.249 --> 17:32.183
6:14. That's when
the sun goes down.

17:32.185 --> 17:35.086
And that means
pledge week is over.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.721
And you can go
back to being yourself.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.256
Where are we gonna go?

17:38.258 --> 17:39.690
Who cares? As long as
it's someplace dirty.

17:39.692 --> 17:40.925
Goodbye, ALF.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.093
- Bye, ALF.
- Bye, ALF.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.829
See you after
the metamorphosis.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.931
Oh, Sir William.

17:46.933 --> 17:50.735
Is there some special meal
you'd like for my last hurrah?

17:51.104 --> 17:53.571
Aw! Oh!

17:53.573 --> 17:56.441
Actually there is one thing

17:56.443 --> 17:58.776
that Kate's always
had a little trouble with.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.045
It's duck a l'orange.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.246
No problem.

18:02.248 --> 18:05.183
Shall I serve a nice
hearty burgundy?

18:05.185 --> 18:08.119
- That would be lovely.
- Count on it.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.353
(Kate)
'Willie, are you coming?'

18:09.355 --> 18:11.556
Oh yeah, you bet.

18:11.558 --> 18:15.927
And we don't want anything
fancy for dinner, either!

18:18.798 --> 18:20.865
[instrumental music]

18:25.772 --> 18:29.640
6:13. One minute to go,
Luckmeister.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.977
Then, I'll be down on you
like a buzzard on a gut-Wagon!

18:34.247 --> 18:37.381
Ah, the duck a l'orange
is ready.

18:37.383 --> 18:40.485
Have some wine.
It'll slow down your reflexes.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.927
<i> Zut alors!</i>

18:49.929 --> 18:51.629
The gas is on.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.432
But I forgot to
light the oven.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.401
Oh, well,
better late than never.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.641
[explosion]

19:12.986 --> 19:14.252
Argh.

19:22.428 --> 19:24.562

we'll have to order in.

19:39.112 --> 19:40.845
I love sweeps week.

19:42.815 --> 19:46.217
Uh-Oh. You'd better
look at this!

19:46.219 --> 19:48.219
Oh, my God!

19:48.221 --> 19:50.188
Just take it easy.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.023
You didn't lose everything.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.624
You've still
got your health.

19:55.962 --> 19:59.297
I'm sorry the firemen
had to chop their way in.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.065
You people should
give me a key.

20:02.235 --> 20:05.336
Trevor, Trevor,
what happened?

20:05.338 --> 20:08.239
I think I know.
What happened.

20:08.241 --> 20:11.375
Where is he?
Where is he!

20:11.377 --> 20:13.044
Oh, Jeeves?

20:13.046 --> 20:14.212
I think he took off

20:14.214 --> 20:15.780
when he saw
the mess in the kitchen.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.049
The kitchen!

20:18.051 --> 20:19.417
I want to see it!

20:21.421 --> 20:25.790
Lynn, why don't you see
if you can find Jeeves.

20:27.527 --> 20:30.595
Trevor, I think we can
handle this from here.

20:30.597 --> 20:34.031
Thanks for waiting
for us to come home.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.466
My pleasure.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.668
Hope you don't mind..

20:38.538 --> 20:40.538
I was a little hungry

20:40.540 --> 20:43.474
so I had some of the crispy duck
that was stuck to the wall.

20:44.777 --> 20:47.011
'Don't worry about it.
Have a good night.'

20:47.013 --> 20:50.047
No need to close the door
on your way out.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.115
Yeah.

20:52.685 --> 20:55.353
Mom, do you think
ALF's okay?

20:55.355 --> 20:56.687
Oh!

20:57.223 --> 20:58.956
I found ALF.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.659
He was hiding in the dryer
with grandma's rosary.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.463
I know what
you're gonna say

21:05.465 --> 21:07.765
and I've already
accepted my fate.

21:07.767 --> 21:11.469
I'm turning myself in
to the alien task force.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.871
I don't deserve to live.

21:13.873 --> 21:18.309
ALF, why do these things
always happen to you?

21:18.311 --> 21:20.144
Beats me.

21:20.146 --> 21:23.781
Maybe in a past life,
I was a wrecking ball.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.417
You were so good all week.
What happened?

21:26.419 --> 21:29.220
Yeah, we'd really
like to know.

21:29.222 --> 21:32.690
I'll keep it simple, Willie.
The kitchen blew up.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.893
This is like
a roadrunner cartoon.

21:37.163 --> 21:40.331
ALF, how did
the kitchen blow up?

21:40.333 --> 21:42.500
Beg your pardon, ma'am.

21:42.502 --> 21:46.070
How did the kitchen blow up?

21:46.839 --> 21:47.972
Uhh.

21:49.342 --> 21:50.808
Uhh..

21:52.679 --> 21:55.813
Just tell me
how the kitchen blew up?

21:55.815 --> 21:58.849
Well, the oven
was on for a while.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.118
Then I realized
I hadn't lit it.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.286
So, I struck a match..

22:02.288 --> 22:04.021
Didn't you smell the gas?

22:04.023 --> 22:06.524
At the time,
I thought it was dill.

22:07.460 --> 22:11.095
Well, goodbye and good luck.

22:13.032 --> 22:16.534
Oh, come on back, ALF.
You don't have anywhere to go.

22:16.536 --> 22:19.337
And we don't want
you to go.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.005
But I failed.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.474
I didn't live up
to the agreement.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.609
I don't deserve to stay.

22:25.611 --> 22:28.846
Oh, we know that,
but you're staying, anyway.

22:29.816 --> 22:30.881
Okay.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.984
Oh, come on, now.
The place is a mess.

22:33.986 --> 22:36.220
We've got a lot
of cleaning up to do.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.989
And if there's one thing
that ALF proved this week

22:38.991 --> 22:41.025
it's that he knows
how to clean up.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.828
Well, actually,
that was the new ALF.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.863
Now that
I'm the old ALF, I don't..

22:49.302 --> 22:51.635
I'll get the push broom, milord.

23:02.382 --> 23:06.317
ALF, I thought you want to take
these things back to Trevor.

23:06.319 --> 23:09.420
They're not Trevor's anymore.
I bought them.

23:09.422 --> 23:11.589
Well, actually,
you bought them.

23:11.591 --> 23:13.157
Your check's in the mail.

Hey, hit the switch, Willie,
you gotta see this.

See what?
