(chuckles):
Okay.

10:20.974 --> 10:23.378
Listen.

10:23.378 --> 10:25.015
Something is not right
on this one.

10:25.015 --> 10:26.552
Got a hit man,
has an open shot

10:26.552 --> 10:28.990
on two marshals,
doesn't take it.

10:28.990 --> 10:30.861
He knew
the transport route.

10:30.861 --> 10:33.132
He wanted us
to find the getaway car.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.436
So, what are
you saying?

10:35.436 --> 10:37.440
I'm saying I think
it's an inside job.

10:37.440 --> 10:40.279
And we don't know
who we can trust on this one.

10:44.020 --> 10:45.289
Listen, Rog.

10:47.426 --> 10:49.030
I'm gonna tell you something.

10:49.030 --> 10:52.571
But you can't tell anyone
else, or I'll deny it.

10:52.571 --> 10:53.773
All right?

10:55.442 --> 10:58.048
I think you're right
and you're a good cop.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.184
Look, we'll tackle
this tomorrow.

10:59.184 --> 11:00.854
But next time,
give me a jingle.

11:00.854 --> 11:01.589
No, let's do it tonight.

11:01.589 --> 11:04.260
I had to cancel
my camping trip

11:04.260 --> 11:06.431
at Lake Arrowhead,
lost the whole deposit.

11:06.431 --> 11:09.003
Oh, wow, so that cabin's just
gonna sit up there all empty.

11:09.003 --> 11:10.406
Yeah.
That's terrible.

11:10.406 --> 11:11.876
It's like
shredding money.

11:11.876 --> 11:13.445
You know what?

11:13.445 --> 11:14.380
You're right.

11:14.380 --> 11:16.886
Let's get on it.
I'm gonna grab my jacket.

11:36.626 --> 11:38.930
Alrighty! All right.

11:38.930 --> 11:40.199
(sighs)

11:40.199 --> 11:41.802
Let's go.

11:44.642 --> 11:45.610
You know, I got to use
the bathroom.

11:45.610 --> 11:47.480
Roger, no, no, no!

11:47.480 --> 11:49.117
No, no, no, wait!

11:51.488 --> 11:54.360
Yeah, see, the uh, the
plumbing's been out for weeks,

11:54.360 --> 11:57.099
so I've just been pooping
and peeing in the ocean.

11:57.099 --> 11:59.003
It's quite liberating.
You should try it.

12:02.209 --> 12:04.180
Yeah, false alarm.

12:10.593 --> 12:13.198
Good morning, baby.

12:13.198 --> 12:14.000
Hmm?
Mwah.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.971
Did you even come
to bed last night?

12:15.971 --> 12:18.208
No, I couldn't sleep.

12:18.208 --> 12:19.979
Oh, I had
trouble, too.

12:19.979 --> 12:22.216
Our baby is graduating.

12:22.216 --> 12:23.485
(laughs):
Oh, my gosh.

12:23.485 --> 12:26.091
Makes me feel old.

12:26.091 --> 12:28.495
No, it was work stuff.

12:28.495 --> 12:30.099
Got my head all spun around.

12:30.099 --> 12:33.238
Let me guess.

12:33.238 --> 12:34.240
Riggs.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.244
Mm.

12:36.244 --> 12:38.281
What did he do this time?

12:38.281 --> 12:40.653
I don't know, but it's so crazy.

12:40.653 --> 12:41.989
I feel guilty

12:41.989 --> 12:44.260
even considering he
may have done it.

12:44.260 --> 12:45.530
Wow.

12:45.530 --> 12:47.266
Well, you know him
better than anyone.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.571
Do you think he's capable
of doing whatever it is?

12:49.571 --> 12:52.410
Trish, if I say yes,

12:52.410 --> 12:56.284
it means deep down inside
I do not believe in him.

12:56.284 --> 12:59.558
And I don't
want that.

12:59.558 --> 13:01.629
So, what does your gut tell you?

13:01.629 --> 13:05.235
My gut says I need an antacid.

13:05.235 --> 13:06.839
(chuckles)

13:12.249 --> 13:14.655
(sighs)

13:14.655 --> 13:16.559
Any tips you have,
you know,

13:16.559 --> 13:21.669
on, uh, torture or anything
like that, always welcome.

13:21.669 --> 13:23.171
What's the end game here?

13:23.171 --> 13:25.275
Well, it depends,

13:25.275 --> 13:27.681
how long it takes you
to tell the truth.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.150
No, I get that part.

13:29.150 --> 13:30.419
Then what?

13:30.419 --> 13:31.889
I let you go.

13:33.693 --> 13:34.695
(laughs)

13:34.695 --> 13:36.164
Yeah, you'll run.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.705
I'll hunt you down,

13:39.705 --> 13:41.575
shoot you in the face
like a gentleman,

13:41.575 --> 13:43.579
and that'll be
the end of it.

13:43.579 --> 13:46.585
A cop gonna murder
someone in cold blood?

13:46.585 --> 13:48.455
You're just not
that kind of man.

13:48.455 --> 13:50.325
Guess we'll just
have to wait and see.

13:50.325 --> 13:53.098
You've had me here
for, what? Ten hours?

13:53.098 --> 13:54.601
And the trailer
before that?

13:54.601 --> 13:58.074
Still got all my fingers,
toes, teeth.

14:00.112 --> 14:01.281
You're scared.

14:03.418 --> 14:04.688
Of you?

14:04.688 --> 14:07.159
Of yourself.

14:07.159 --> 14:10.032
Yeah, see, to
truly break a man,

14:10.032 --> 14:12.303
there's certain lines
you got to cross.

14:13.438 --> 14:15.309
(chuckles)

14:15.309 --> 14:16.612
No.

14:16.612 --> 14:18.181
You're not ready.

14:18.181 --> 14:19.217
Hmm.

Hey.

14:52.383 --> 14:54.153
Where's Riggs?
He's not in yet.

14:54.153 --> 14:55.255
You try his phone?

14:55.255 --> 14:56.391
Three times.

14:56.391 --> 14:58.128
What's so important
he can miss work

14:58.128 --> 14:59.665
with a fugitive out there?

14:59.665 --> 15:03.606
I'm the one that's got a kid
that's graduating in 24 hours.

15:03.606 --> 15:04.608
Track his phone.

15:04.608 --> 15:06.477
Seriously?

15:06.477 --> 15:08.749
That's a violation
of trust.

15:08.749 --> 15:10.252
You don't think...?

15:10.252 --> 15:11.622
You're the boss.

15:15.362 --> 15:16.497
Hmm.

15:16.497 --> 15:18.769
Looks like we won't
be seeing Riggs

15:18.769 --> 15:20.640
anytime soon.
Why's that?

15:20.640 --> 15:22.644
Well, he's a few hours away
in Lake Arrowhead.

15:22.644 --> 15:24.514
Near Cedar Grove Lane?

15:25.650 --> 15:26.985
Yeah. How'd you know?

15:28.522 --> 15:30.125
Where you going?

15:30.125 --> 15:31.294
You gonna bring
his ass in?

15:31.294 --> 15:32.262
Yeah, I am.

15:39.811 --> 15:42.282
You gonna burn me
with that thing now?

15:45.556 --> 15:47.159
No.

15:47.159 --> 15:49.330
That's a good idea.

15:49.330 --> 15:51.467
Geez, Gideon.

15:51.467 --> 15:53.171
Everything about
torture with you?

15:53.171 --> 15:54.708
Huh?

15:54.708 --> 15:56.344
You're not even asking
the right questions.

15:58.181 --> 16:01.120
You keep wanting to know,
did I kill her.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.657
When you know
I didn't.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.160
I wasn't driving
the truck.

16:06.665 --> 16:08.803
What you really
want to know is

16:08.803 --> 16:10.405
did I give the order.

16:10.405 --> 16:12.009
Right?

16:14.413 --> 16:17.319
See, that would be
a better question.

16:19.290 --> 16:20.258
Did you?

16:20.258 --> 16:25.302
Or, a more interesting
question would be...

16:25.302 --> 16:27.339
what did she look like?

16:27.339 --> 16:30.580
You know,
at the end.

16:30.580 --> 16:32.449
Did she die on impact,

16:32.449 --> 16:37.192
or just gurgle
her last few breaths?

16:50.887 --> 16:53.626
No.
(clicks tongue)

16:53.626 --> 16:54.761
You weren't there, silly.

16:54.761 --> 16:56.899
Yes, I was.

16:56.899 --> 16:59.504

watching, waiting.

went to the hospital.

I gave the order.

17:24.219 --> 17:25.355

about this, the better.

18:13.652 --> 18:14.654
Why, Riggs?

18:14.654 --> 18:17.392
That's what I need
to know: why?

18:17.392 --> 18:18.428
He killed Miranda.

18:18.428 --> 18:19.931
You believe that?

18:19.931 --> 18:21.568
Palmer told me.

23:18.227 --> 23:19.329
Why would he lie?

23:19.329 --> 23:21.233
Maybe he misspoke because
you were torturing him.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.805
No‐‐ I was questioning him.

23:23.805 --> 23:25.942
You told me you broke
a couple of his fingers.

23:25.942 --> 23:27.546
Sprained, partially,
like, fractured.

23:27.546 --> 23:30.752
Look, Rog, he was fine
when I was questioning him.

23:30.752 --> 23:32.956
Okay? I mean, up until
the point you killed him.

23:32.956 --> 23:34.326
Riggs, Riggs, I‐I can't...

23:34.326 --> 23:35.662
No, you <i>can</i> do this. We are
gonna fly under the radar.

23:35.662 --> 23:38.568
We're gonna go down
to Texas, we're gonna
find out what they know.

23:38.568 --> 23:39.970
They got great barbeque!
I'm getting a new partner!

Hey, it's my son's

25:40.444 --> 25:42.048

I know.

25:50.331 --> 25:52.468
I got mirrors.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.339
So what you working on?

25:54.339 --> 25:55.775
What's this?

25:55.775 --> 25:57.913
Riggs' arrest files
from El Paso.

25:57.913 --> 25:59.917
Told me to flag any
connections to the cartel.

25:59.917 --> 26:01.186
When? When did he tell you that?

26:01.186 --> 26:03.290
Yesterday. Early evening.

26:03.290 --> 26:06.129
You know what, Bailey?
You need to shut this down.

26:06.129 --> 26:09.168
Okay. But do you at least
want to know what I found?

26:09.168 --> 26:11.039
No. Because there's
nothing to find.

26:12.743 --> 26:14.880
Is there?
Is there something to find?

26:14.880 --> 26:16.049
Well, it's hard to say for sure,

26:16.049 --> 26:17.051
but I was able...
Okay, you know what?

26:17.051 --> 26:18.186
I'm not going down this road.

26:18.186 --> 26:19.757
I told Riggs it's a dead end.

26:19.757 --> 26:20.659
It's a dead end.

26:22.161 --> 26:23.765
Is it a dead end?

26:23.765 --> 26:25.167
Do you want me
to tell you or not?

26:25.167 --> 26:27.171
I don't even want...
I don't want to know.

26:27.171 --> 26:30.044
What'd you find?

26:30.044 --> 26:32.214
DELGADO: <i>So what can</i>
<i>I do for you, Martin?</i>

26:32.214 --> 26:36.791
I believe I'm responsible
for Miranda's death, Ronnie.

26:36.791 --> 26:40.230
Martin...

26:40.230 --> 26:42.101
Martin, it was an accident.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.807
You need to let it go.

26:44.807 --> 26:46.109
Ronnie, don't
ask me how...

26:48.246 --> 26:49.817
...but I know it was a hit.

26:51.954 --> 26:53.958
A hit?

26:53.958 --> 26:55.094
(chuckles)

26:55.094 --> 26:55.895
For what?

26:55.895 --> 26:59.402
If I back off the
cartel in Texas.

26:59.402 --> 27:02.041
Because you busted
a couple of low‐level guys?

27:02.041 --> 27:04.178
Stop it.
You need to move on.

27:04.178 --> 27:06.182
That's what I'm trying
to do here, Ronnie.

27:06.182 --> 27:09.088
I'm just trying to come clean so
I can make sense of everything.

27:09.088 --> 27:10.792
By telling me
this nonsense?

27:10.792 --> 27:13.196
Getting me to fall
into this abyss with you?

27:13.196 --> 27:14.933
I won't do it.

27:14.933 --> 27:16.937
ROSIE:
Poppy?

27:16.937 --> 27:19.342
You said we were going
to the park.

27:19.342 --> 27:20.477
We are, sweetie.

27:20.477 --> 27:23.083
In just a minute.

27:23.083 --> 27:24.953
You remember Uncle Martin.

27:24.953 --> 27:27.258
Hi, Rosie.

27:27.258 --> 27:32.101
Last time I saw you,
you were that big.

27:32.101 --> 27:33.838
I was never that big.

27:33.838 --> 27:35.374
Meet you outside, <i>mija.</i>

27:35.374 --> 27:37.111
I'll be right there.

27:41.987 --> 27:44.258
(breathes deeply)

27:44.258 --> 27:45.528
I know it hurts.

27:45.528 --> 27:46.864
Yeah.

27:46.864 --> 27:49.001
I feel it every day.

27:51.139 --> 27:52.576
But you have to let go.

27:52.576 --> 27:55.748
It's what she'd want.

27:57.284 --> 28:00.057
I know. I know.

28:00.057 --> 28:01.994
And I'm trying, Ronnie.

28:01.994 --> 28:04.967
Forget that nonsense
about Gideon.

28:13.517 --> 28:16.857
How did you know
it was Gideon?

28:16.857 --> 28:17.993
What?

28:20.297 --> 28:22.301
I never said his name.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.539
(scoffs)

28:24.539 --> 28:26.442
That's who you had in custody.

28:26.442 --> 28:28.280
I‐I just assumed.

28:28.280 --> 28:29.282
MIRANDA:
<i>Hey, Daddy.</i>

28:29.282 --> 28:31.152
Wait, wait. Slow down.

28:31.152 --> 28:33.423
He's freaking out. I think
he's more nervous than you are.

28:33.423 --> 28:37.031
You were so nervous
that morning.

28:37.031 --> 28:39.035
What morning?

28:39.035 --> 28:40.605
When she was killed.

28:40.605 --> 28:42.207
I thought we just got past this.

28:42.207 --> 28:44.178
Miranda was
nine months pregnant,

28:44.178 --> 28:46.316
and you wanted her
to get out of town.

28:46.316 --> 28:47.484
Why?

28:47.484 --> 28:49.322
It‐it wasn't logical.

28:49.322 --> 28:51.326
Uh, I was nervous.

28:53.363 --> 28:54.933
Or maybe you were afraid.

28:59.475 --> 29:02.281
Ronnie. Ronnie, Ronnie, hey.
Everything's gonna be fine.

29:02.281 --> 29:05.320
Look, we're about to have
a nice breakfast,

29:05.320 --> 29:07.291
<i>blueberry pancakes...</i>

29:09.195 --> 29:11.165
I told <i>you</i> about the pancakes.

29:11.165 --> 29:12.167
What?

29:12.167 --> 29:13.269
The cartel wasn't
watching us.

29:13.269 --> 29:15.307
Why would they be watching us?
They were listening.

29:15.307 --> 29:17.044
Okay, I think you should leave.
Why would they be
listening to me?

29:17.044 --> 29:19.916
Because I was just chasing
low‐level cartel guys, right?

29:19.916 --> 29:22.054
You said so yourself.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.630
They were listening to you.

29:26.630 --> 29:28.366
<i>(cell phone ringing)</i>

29:28.366 --> 29:30.605
Hey, baby.

29:30.605 --> 29:33.243
Got to finish a couple of things
at work, and then I'll be home.

29:33.243 --> 29:34.613
Okay, we'll wait for you, then.

29:34.613 --> 29:36.517
RJ's having trouble
with his tie.

29:38.954 --> 29:41.092
Are you seriously
this dense?

29:41.092 --> 29:42.394
How are they
letting you graduate?

29:42.394 --> 29:44.398
Oh, yeah.

29:44.398 --> 29:46.402
Dad, I could really
use some help.

29:46.402 --> 29:48.641
Ha, finally.

29:48.641 --> 29:50.277
I got you, son.

29:50.277 --> 29:51.647
Don't let him tie his tie
without me.

29:51.647 --> 29:53.383
I'm on my way.

29:53.383 --> 29:54.519
Okay, love you.

29:54.519 --> 29:57.291
MURTAUGH:
<i>I love you, too.</i>

29:57.291 --> 29:59.395

29:59.395 --> 30:01.299

30:09.181 --> 30:10.417
(panting)

30:11.553 --> 30:13.156
(tires screech)

30:19.603 --> 30:21.607
So now what?

30:21.607 --> 30:24.211
You just... you work
for the cartel?

30:24.211 --> 30:27.050
Is that how
this works?

30:27.050 --> 30:28.754
I don't say no anymore.

30:28.754 --> 30:31.727
What choice do I have?

30:31.727 --> 30:33.496
I have other daughters.

30:33.496 --> 30:35.467
Grandchildren.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.505
You don't know

30:37.505 --> 30:39.609
what these people
are capable of.

30:41.747 --> 30:44.084
I have a pretty good idea.

30:55.775 --> 30:57.477
Who ordered the hit, Ronnie?

31:01.553 --> 31:04.191
Who's responsible for
killing your daughter?

31:05.728 --> 31:07.331
My wife.

31:10.203 --> 31:11.372
Your grandson.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.351
(crying)

31:23.229 --> 31:24.498
Flores.

31:26.235 --> 31:28.507
It's been
all Tito Flores.

31:30.243 --> 31:32.114
(vehicle approaching)

31:40.263 --> 31:41.265
(grunts)

31:43.136 --> 31:44.806
Your partner's
a lousy shot.

31:44.806 --> 31:47.679
Yeah, it's been a real issue.

31:47.679 --> 31:49.415
You know, we're working on it.

31:49.415 --> 31:50.417
But me,
on the other hand...

31:50.417 --> 31:52.287
Hey there, sweetie.
(grunts)

31:52.287 --> 31:53.423
That your Uncle Martin?

31:53.423 --> 31:57.431
You think he might go for
a ride to see his partner?

31:57.431 --> 31:59.435
Yeah.

32:08.252 --> 32:09.421
Come here, Rosie.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.272
Yeah.

32:18.272 --> 32:19.576
I'm sorry, Martin.

32:19.576 --> 32:21.847
I didn't mean for
it to end this way.

32:21.847 --> 32:25.019
Come on, Ronnie.
It was supposed to end this way.

32:28.426 --> 32:30.330
(engine starts)

32:45.326 --> 32:46.863
Hey.
Yeah?

32:46.863 --> 32:49.201
This is all your fault.
You know that, right?

32:49.201 --> 32:52.508
Oh, that's a classy move, Rog,
pointing out the obvious.

32:52.508 --> 32:53.510
Hmm.

32:53.510 --> 32:54.612
You know what
really sucks?

32:54.612 --> 32:56.616
Yeah, that this is
the most important day

32:56.616 --> 32:59.622
of my son's life, and I'm here
bleeding out with you.

32:59.622 --> 33:02.427
Okay, yeah, that...
that‐that is bad.

33:02.427 --> 33:04.431
But worse is the fact
that you're gonna die

33:04.431 --> 33:05.433
because you're my partner,

33:05.433 --> 33:08.707
and, technically, you're
not really my partner.

33:08.707 --> 33:11.312
Yeah, that's, uh...
that is worse.

33:11.312 --> 33:12.447
Much worse.
Yeah.

33:14.184 --> 33:16.623
Hey, Riggs.
Yeah?

33:16.623 --> 33:19.461
I, uh... I looked into
your wife's death,

33:19.461 --> 33:22.501
and, um, you need
to know that, um,

33:22.501 --> 33:25.608
it wasn't your fault
that she died, it was...

33:25.608 --> 33:28.479
Delgado. Yeah, I know.

33:28.479 --> 33:30.784
When'd you find out?

33:30.784 --> 33:33.624
This afternoon,
around 4:00. You?

33:33.624 --> 33:35.628
About, uh, 3:50.

33:35.628 --> 33:37.665
So you looked at your watch
when you found out?

33:37.665 --> 33:40.236
No, I have a flawless
internal clock.

33:40.236 --> 33:42.240
RIGGS: An internal clock?
So what time is it right now?

33:42.240 --> 33:44.378
6:42.
6:42?

33:44.378 --> 33:46.248
Hey, bad guys,
who has a watch on?

33:46.248 --> 33:47.384
I want to know exactly
what time it is right now.
I swear to God,

33:47.384 --> 33:48.820
if I have to listen to you two
for one more second...

33:48.820 --> 33:49.956
You could let us go.

33:49.956 --> 33:51.392
You could let us go.
That's a good idea.

33:51.392 --> 33:52.662
Sure thing.

33:52.662 --> 33:55.834
But first, I need some answers.

33:55.834 --> 34:00.711
And I don't expect to get the
truth without some persuasion.

34:00.711 --> 34:02.615
Aw...
Yeah, torture. No,
that's his whole thing.

34:02.615 --> 34:04.619
He wasn't hugged
enough as a child.

34:04.619 --> 34:06.355
So...

34:06.355 --> 34:07.658
who wants to go first?

34:07.658 --> 34:08.894
I will.
He does.

34:08.894 --> 34:10.496
GIDEON: Good, good.
I'm glad you said that.

34:14.639 --> 34:15.674
RIGGS: No, no, no.
Wait a minute. No, no, no.
