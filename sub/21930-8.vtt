WEBVTT

00:01.611 --> 00:02.890
Can we start the movie?

00:03.405 --> 00:05.138
Before Sheldon gets here?

00:05.140 --> 00:07.807
Last time we did that, he didn't
talk to us for a month.

00:07.809 --> 00:10.610
So do it!

00:10.612 --> 00:12.178
Hold on. Where is he?

00:12.180 --> 00:15.381
Well, according to his text,
he was on the second floor,

00:15.383 --> 00:18.184
then he stopped
to tie his shoe.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.788
All tied, and...

00:21.790 --> 00:23.656
Hello!
Hi.

00:23.658 --> 00:25.091
Sorry we're late.

00:25.093 --> 00:28.561
Amy took forever
tying my shoe.

00:28.563 --> 00:29.829
All right!

00:29.831 --> 00:31.798
Who's excited
to see a documentary?

00:31.800 --> 00:33.099
Oh, I know this one.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.300
Nobody ever.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.669
Hey! This one's
going to be great.

00:36.671 --> 00:37.871
This is about the rivalry

00:37.873 --> 00:40.406
between a cool renegade
scientist, Nikola Tesla,

00:40.408 --> 00:42.775
and his arch-nemesis,
Thomas Edison.

00:42.777 --> 00:44.777
It's the greatest
scientific feud of all time.

00:44.779 --> 00:47.647
I mean, you can forget
about Leibniz and Newton.

00:47.649 --> 00:49.015
Done.

00:49.017 --> 00:52.886
So, Tesla's the one
that invented the electric car?

00:54.289 --> 00:55.655
No, Penny.

00:55.657 --> 00:58.358
No, the car is just
named after him.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.059
Okay, you don't have to be
so smug about it.

01:00.061 --> 01:01.694
You know, you went
to see that movie <i>It</i>

01:01.696 --> 01:04.330
because you thought
it was about scary I.T. guys.

01:06.601 --> 01:09.602
Tesla was a genius who
invented our electrical grid.

01:09.604 --> 01:11.738
Edison just wanted to
get rich and famous.

01:11.740 --> 01:13.339
Didn't he invent the lightbulb?

01:13.341 --> 01:15.008
That's what
he wants you to think.

01:15.010 --> 01:17.143
But without the foundational
work of Ebenezer Kinnersley,

01:17.145 --> 01:19.545
Warren de la Rue
and James Bowman Lindsay,

01:19.547 --> 01:21.648
you wouldn't know Edison
any more than you know

01:21.650 --> 01:24.817
Ebenezer Kinnersley, Warren de
la Rue or James Bowman Lindsay.

01:25.687 --> 01:28.955
Isn't he sexy
all fired up?

01:28.957 --> 01:30.890
He really gets
my current alternating,

01:30.892 --> 01:33.526
if you know what I mean.

01:33.528 --> 01:36.529
Edison was kind of a
publicity hog and a bully.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.298
Yeah, he electrocuted
an elephant named Topsy

01:38.300 --> 01:39.565
just to make himself famous.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.167
If I had an elephant
named Topsy,

01:41.169 --> 01:42.669
he would want for nothing.

01:43.838 --> 01:46.472
Also, he'd be named Jumbo.

01:46.474 --> 01:50.009
And worse than that, Edison
filmed the first on-screen kiss,

01:50.011 --> 01:53.346
so he's basically
a pornographer.

01:54.349 --> 01:56.082
Although every time
I put that in Wikipedia,

01:56.084 --> 01:59.185
someone takes it out.

01:59.187 --> 02:01.721
Is your current
still alternating?

02:01.723 --> 02:04.958
We're lucky there aren't
any elephants in here.

02:31.051 --> 02:32.918
You know, that documentary
last night was actually

02:32.920 --> 02:34.090
better than I
thought it would be.

02:34.114 --> 02:35.221
Really?

02:35.222 --> 02:36.989
Should've been about
Samuel Morse

02:36.991 --> 02:39.792
the way they telegraphed
that ending.

02:39.794 --> 02:41.794
I already pretended to laugh
at that joke once.

02:41.796 --> 02:43.796
Do I have to do it again?

02:43.798 --> 02:46.265
Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.968
Samuel Morse. You kill me.

02:52.106 --> 02:54.573
Leonard, can you
drive me to work?

02:54.575 --> 02:56.108
Yeah, sure.
Oh, hey, the guys and I

02:56.110 --> 02:57.810
were talking about
going to see the Tesla coil

02:57.812 --> 03:00.078
at the observatory later on,
if you want to join.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.214
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm busy.

03:02.216 --> 03:04.650
Why? What are you doing?
Leonard, what are <i>you</i> doing?

03:04.652 --> 03:07.452
He said he can't go.
Make a sad face, move on.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.421
It's fine.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.490
I couldn't tell you
even if I wanted to.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.958
What does that mean?
Leonard!

03:12.960 --> 03:15.427
Sad face, sad face.

03:15.429 --> 03:18.397
I mean, I would like to,
but I just can't, you know,

03:18.399 --> 03:20.599
because it's classified
and top secret.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.435
Hold on, are you still
working for the military?

03:23.437 --> 03:24.736
I'm so glad
you figured that out!

03:24.738 --> 03:26.905
It was killing me
keeping it a secret!

03:26.907 --> 03:28.540
I thought they
fired you guys.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.676
They did,
but then they hired me back.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.544
Well, you better not be
working on our project,

03:32.546 --> 03:33.679
because we're a team.

03:33.681 --> 03:36.849
Leonard, there is
no "I" in team.

03:36.851 --> 03:38.250
However,
there is an "I" in

03:38.252 --> 03:41.887
"I'm working with the military
and you're not."

03:41.889 --> 03:44.089
There's five of them, in fact.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.228
Hey, hey.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.929
I got a big surprise for you.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.098
Is it pie and ice cream?

03:54.134 --> 03:55.901
Wow, did I oversell it.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.569
It's Raj and Ruchi!

03:57.571 --> 03:59.171
Hello.

03:59.173 --> 04:00.405
Hey. Hi.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.673
Hey, what are
you two doing here?

04:01.675 --> 04:02.708
We won't stay long.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.376
I just wanted
to drop something off

04:04.378 --> 04:05.944
from me and the girls at work.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.981
None of the girls at work
like me enough to get me a gift.

04:08.983 --> 04:10.983
Okay, so you'll know
why everyone at the office

04:10.985 --> 04:12.651
has the same handwriting.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.153
I really appreciate
the thought,

04:15.155 --> 04:17.555
but it's not necessary.
I'll be back soon.

04:17.558 --> 04:20.325
Don't worry about work.
You take all the time you need.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.094
Yeah, just turn
off your brain

04:22.096 --> 04:24.463
and let your uterus
do its magic.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.600
It's the star
of the show now.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.671
Okay, wasn't sure how long
I should let you guys stay.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.240
Now I know!
Get out!

04:35.242 --> 04:37.309
Good to see you.
You look amazing.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.211
Thanks for coming!

04:40.214 --> 04:42.948
That bitch.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.017
Oh, come on, he means well.

04:45.019 --> 04:48.020
He's just trying
to impress his girlfriend.

04:48.022 --> 04:50.055
I'm talking about Ruchi.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.556
She's after my job.

04:51.558 --> 04:54.493
Why do you think she said,
"Take all the time you need"?

04:54.495 --> 04:57.095
Because she was being nice?

04:57.097 --> 05:00.165
No, she's trying to steal
my projects while I'm at home

05:00.167 --> 05:03.936
taking care of this useless
plant and my dumb family.

05:03.938 --> 05:07.639
I'm only saying this
because I love you

05:07.641 --> 05:09.875
and because you can't
reach me from that bed,

05:09.877 --> 05:12.077
but you sound a little crazy.

05:12.079 --> 05:15.280
I love you, too, but I could
fling this card in your eye

05:15.282 --> 05:18.183
like a ninja throwing star.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.985
I don't believe you.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.260
Why would the military
want Sheldon?

05:28.262 --> 05:31.630
I don't know. Target practice?

05:31.632 --> 05:34.533
Well, he better not be
working on our guidance system.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.034
That was my idea.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.402
Why don't we call
Colonel Williams

05:37.404 --> 05:39.071
and find out
what's going on.

05:39.073 --> 05:42.107
Great. I want answers
and he'd better give them to us.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.644
Hello, gentlemen.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.747
Hi, sir.
Um, Leonard has a question.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.785
Hey, is Sheldon working on
our project again?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.287
Did he say that?

05:55.289 --> 05:56.555
No, he wouldn't tell us.

05:56.557 --> 06:01.259
Huh. So he <i>can</i>
keep his mouth shut.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.362
How do I get him to do that?

06:03.364 --> 06:07.032
Is he working on
our guidance system or not?

06:07.034 --> 06:10.168
Dr. Cooper contacted us
with an idea on how to modify

06:10.170 --> 06:12.704
your technology into
a communication system,

06:12.706 --> 06:14.106
and it seemed interesting.

06:14.108 --> 06:17.709
But our team developed
that technology.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.311
And he was your team leader.

06:19.313 --> 06:20.946
Well, who said
he was team leader?

06:20.948 --> 06:22.347
He did.

06:23.317 --> 06:25.951
And I like that kind of
"take charge" attitude.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.153
We can have "take
charge" attitudes.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.689
Then why didn't either of you
ask to be team leader?

06:30.691 --> 06:33.291
We didn't want to step
on anyone's toes.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.160
Yeah, so we were just

06:35.162 --> 06:39.264
waiting for you to tell us who
you thought... Okay, I hear it.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.968
- Are we done?
- No, no.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.737
I am taking charge right
now and telling you

06:45.739 --> 06:47.205
that it is not okay
with us if...

06:47.207 --> 06:50.008
Okay, bye.

06:53.147 --> 06:55.547
Hey. I just got your text.
Everything okay?

06:55.549 --> 06:58.350
Yeah, there's just something
I need to ask you.

06:58.352 --> 07:01.119
Oh, Bernie,
I'd be thrilled.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.288
It's not be my birth coach.

07:03.290 --> 07:06.892
Okay, that hurts, but luckily I
know how to breathe through it.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.799
I need you to find out
if Ruchi's trying to steal

07:13.801 --> 07:15.934
my projects at work
while I'm on bed rest.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.637
She's not that
kind of a person.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.440
She's-she's generous
and charitable.

07:21.442 --> 07:23.542
You're just saying that
'cause she's sleeping with you.

07:23.544 --> 07:26.078
Yes, that's my favorite charity.

07:26.080 --> 07:31.016
I know I sound paranoid, but
I'm feeling really vulnerable.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.418
If there's anything you could
find out, it'd be great.

07:33.420 --> 07:37.456
And if she is up to anything,
what are you gonna do?

07:37.458 --> 07:38.957
Nothing.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.659
I'll just calmly
talk to her and explain

07:40.661 --> 07:43.161
there are certain boundaries
that need to be respected.

07:43.163 --> 07:47.165
It's really for the benefit
of everyone at the company.

07:49.002 --> 07:52.304
Uh, okay, what you're saying
sounds nice,

07:52.306 --> 07:53.905
but the way you're saying it

07:53.907 --> 07:57.642
is causing my testicles
to take cover in my abdomen.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.947
What do you want to watch?

08:01.949 --> 08:03.548
Oh, why don't you pick.

08:03.550 --> 08:05.450
Okay, how about comedy?

08:05.452 --> 08:08.253
Eh, I already laughed today.

08:08.255 --> 08:12.390
I know. It was when
I stubbed my toe.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.292
Still funny.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.628
Drama?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.697
Nah, I've already
seen someone cry today.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.866
It really hurt, Sheldon!

08:22.035 --> 08:23.602
Hey.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.370
We talked to
Colonel Williams.

08:25.372 --> 08:26.638
He told us everything.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.240
I'm sorry, can we do this
another time?

08:28.242 --> 08:32.376
Amy's just about to realize she
wants to watch a Hulk marathon.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.712
What's going on?

08:33.714 --> 08:36.681
Sheldon went to the Air
Force behind our backs.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.316
I did nothing of the sort.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.683
I had an idea

08:39.686 --> 08:41.419
for a neutrino-based
communication system,

08:41.421 --> 08:44.089
I presented it to them,
and they were interested.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.024
But y-your
communication system

08:46.026 --> 08:48.126
was based on our
guidance system.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.995
And sonar is based on bats.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.897
You don't see them
hanging upside down

08:51.899 --> 08:54.032
in a patent attorney's office.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.302
You know what, you like to think
that you're just like Tesla,

08:57.304 --> 08:59.671
but the truth is
you're exactly like Edison.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.106
You take that back.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.041
No, he's right.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.511
You are a bully, a credit
hog and a self-promoter.

09:06.513 --> 09:11.249
And if anyone around here
is like Tesla, it's us.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.587
Yeah.

09:18.292 --> 09:21.092
Can you believe they said
I was just like Edison?

09:21.094 --> 09:24.029
Yeah, and in front of
a lady, no less.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.131
Well, you are
building on their work

09:26.133 --> 09:27.632
and taking the
credit for it.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.067
That's a classic
Edison move.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.835
Oh, yeah?

09:30.837 --> 09:32.871
Well, if I'm Edison
and you love me,

09:32.873 --> 09:34.806
then what does that say
about you?

09:34.808 --> 09:36.541
I honestly don't know.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.310
Okay.

09:38.312 --> 09:40.612
Well, I have to Google
some stuff about Mrs. Edison.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.781
I'll be right back.

09:46.149 --> 09:47.548
You know whose fault this is?

09:47.550 --> 09:48.516
I do.

09:48.518 --> 09:50.118
Yours.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.320
No, my mother's.

09:52.322 --> 09:54.889
"Go make friends, Sheldon."

09:55.759 --> 09:56.858
What happens?

09:56.860 --> 09:58.860
20 years later,
they call me names.

09:58.862 --> 10:02.764
I don't think what they
called you is the point here.

10:02.766 --> 10:04.832
Oh, yeah?
How would you feel

10:04.834 --> 10:08.069
if I called you the name of a
neuroscientist you didn't like?

10:08.071 --> 10:10.405
Do you know the name
of any neuroscientist?

10:10.407 --> 10:11.873
Of course.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.207
Not me?

10:13.209 --> 10:16.611
Then no.

10:16.613 --> 10:19.414
Do you think they're right, Amy?

10:20.583 --> 10:23.284
Do you think I'm like Edison?

10:23.286 --> 10:27.221
Sheldon, I don't
think you're upset

10:27.223 --> 10:30.391
because of what kind of
scientist they said you're like.

10:30.393 --> 10:32.059
I think you're
upset because

10:32.061 --> 10:34.128
your friend''
feelings got hurt.

10:34.130 --> 10:37.298
You're right.

10:37.300 --> 10:40.301
I care too much about
other people's feelings.

10:41.838 --> 10:44.605
It's always been my fatal flaw.

10:44.607 --> 10:47.241
Sheldon, I
don't think...

10:47.243 --> 10:50.044
No, no, not now, Amy.
I'm growing as a person.

10:52.415 --> 10:55.183
Ah, that was fun.

10:55.185 --> 10:57.852
Put her there, buddy.

10:57.854 --> 11:01.189
I am not fist bumping
you after we have sex.

11:01.191 --> 11:03.891
You're the one who wanted
to keep things casual.

11:03.893 --> 11:06.494
There's a difference
between casual and weird.

11:06.496 --> 11:08.796
Not the way I do it.

11:10.633 --> 11:14.302
So, um... how was,
how was your day?

11:14.304 --> 11:16.504
Like, how's-how's work?

11:16.506 --> 11:18.005
Oh, great.

11:18.007 --> 11:19.407
With Bernadette gone,

11:19.409 --> 11:21.742
I'm getting to handle
all her projects.

11:21.744 --> 11:23.411
Well, she's-she's not gone.

11:23.413 --> 11:24.879
She'll be back soon.

11:24.881 --> 11:28.015
Not too soon, let's hope.

11:29.385 --> 11:31.719
So it turns out Ruchi is totally

11:31.721 --> 11:33.454
trying to take over
Bernadette's projects.

11:33.456 --> 11:35.523
Wow, she just told you
that out of the blue?

11:35.525 --> 11:37.325
Yeah, yeah,
we had just made love.

11:37.327 --> 11:39.360
It was so beautiful.

11:40.330 --> 11:41.829
Our caramel-colored bodies

11:41.831 --> 11:44.265
were entwined like
erotic taffy...

11:44.267 --> 11:46.100
Get to the point!
Oh.

11:46.102 --> 11:47.735
Uh, sorry, uh, yeah.

11:47.737 --> 11:50.304
I-I asked her about work,
and she just admitted

11:50.306 --> 11:52.340
she has her eyes
on Bernadette's projects.

11:52.342 --> 11:53.508
Can't believe she
would take advantage

11:53.510 --> 11:54.775
of a pregnant
lady like that.

11:54.777 --> 11:55.877
So what did you do?

11:55.879 --> 11:57.345
What do you think I did?

11:57.347 --> 12:00.615
I made small talk for 20 minutes
and had sex again.

12:00.617 --> 12:03.150
You have to say
something to Bernie.

12:03.152 --> 12:05.486
I don't know. If I do that,
she's gonna confront Ruchi,

12:05.488 --> 12:07.855
and then Ruchi's gonna
stop sleeping with me.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.557
Raj, you can't go on
sleeping with a woman

12:09.559 --> 12:10.925
who's trying to screw
over your friend.

12:10.927 --> 12:14.195
Can't or must?

12:16.566 --> 12:18.633
You know, that guidance system
was my idea.

12:18.635 --> 12:19.934
You figured out
how to make it work.

12:19.936 --> 12:21.335
We didn't even need Sheldon.

12:21.337 --> 12:24.171
Let's not forget your idea
was based on my theory.

12:24.173 --> 12:27.808
Hey, we're bagging
on Sheldon here! Focus!

12:28.978 --> 12:31.946
I guess it was pretty smart
using our quantum technology

12:31.948 --> 12:33.948
as the basis for
a communication system.

12:33.950 --> 12:36.884
Be even better if he swapped out
the helium for xenon.

12:36.886 --> 12:40.588
Ooh. So instead of having to
keep it at negative 271 degrees,

12:40.590 --> 12:42.690
you'd only have to keep it
at negative 108.

12:42.692 --> 12:44.058
It would be way more efficient.

12:44.060 --> 12:46.160
And xenon has a bigger nucleus,

12:46.162 --> 12:48.963
so coherence would make it
an easier signal to see.

12:48.965 --> 12:50.197
You're brilliant!

12:50.199 --> 12:51.232
We should tell Sheldon.

12:51.234 --> 12:52.833
You're an idiot!

12:53.803 --> 12:54.969
We don't tell Sheldon.

12:54.971 --> 12:56.537
We go to the military
behind his back

12:56.539 --> 12:58.573
and we screw him
like he screwed us.

12:58.575 --> 12:59.974
All right, you're right,
you're right, we don't need him.

12:59.976 --> 13:01.108
We can do this all on our own.

13:01.110 --> 13:02.066
Do you think
you can do the math?

13:02.090 --> 13:03.317
No.

13:05.415 --> 13:06.614
But if someone else does it,

13:06.616 --> 13:10.017
I can double check
the crap out of it.

13:11.220 --> 13:14.288
I want you to know,
I did what you asked.

13:14.290 --> 13:17.224
I talked to Ruchi and found out
what's going on at work.

13:17.226 --> 13:19.260
So is she trying
to steal my projects?

13:19.262 --> 13:21.062
No, not trying to,
sounds like it's a done deal.

13:21.064 --> 13:22.229
Here, have a brownie.

13:22.231 --> 13:24.465
I'm gonna kill her.

13:24.467 --> 13:26.334
Okay, don't take this
out on Ruchi.

13:26.336 --> 13:28.436
Is she trying to
take your job? Yes.

13:28.438 --> 13:29.937
Is she parking
in your space? Yes.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.973
Did she get a laugh
at a meeting yesterday

13:31.975 --> 13:34.275
by calling you "Pregnadette"?
Big one.

13:35.645 --> 13:39.080
But you would've done the exact
same thing, and you know it.

13:39.082 --> 13:41.482
I never would've
undermined a coworker.

13:41.484 --> 13:43.684
What? Oh, please.
Wh-What about that guy Eric,

13:43.686 --> 13:46.354
who you told it was
"Bring Your Cat to Work Day"

13:46.356 --> 13:49.156
when you knew
your boss had asthma?

13:49.158 --> 13:51.459
That was just a hilarious prank

13:51.461 --> 13:54.962
that ended with me
getting a corner office.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.964
All I'm saying is

13:56.966 --> 13:58.566
before you attack Ruchi,
maybe you should

13:58.568 --> 14:00.501
take a long hard look
in the mirror,

14:00.503 --> 14:01.936
because you know
what you'll see--

14:01.938 --> 14:04.505
apart from radiant skin
and luxuriously thick hair?

14:04.507 --> 14:06.007
Hypocrisy!

14:11.614 --> 14:14.615
It is thick.

14:15.785 --> 14:18.052
So what do you think?
Can you make it work?

14:18.054 --> 14:20.221
Uh, I just need to
use the cross section

14:20.223 --> 14:22.890
to calculate the probability
of the interaction.

14:22.892 --> 14:24.291
Can we help?

14:24.293 --> 14:25.626
Yes.

14:25.628 --> 14:28.362
Why don't you run
get me a can of Pringles.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.666
Leonard, I was--

14:31.668 --> 14:34.235
What's Kripke doing here?

14:34.237 --> 14:36.370
Oh, he's just helping us
develop a better, more efficient

14:36.372 --> 14:38.572
neutrino comm system that we're
gonna pitch to the military,

14:38.574 --> 14:39.740
making yours obsolete.

14:39.742 --> 14:40.841
Yeah,
Leonard thought of it.

14:40.843 --> 14:42.276
It's genius.
Oh, thanks.

14:42.278 --> 14:44.111
You see, instead of
using liquid helium...

14:44.113 --> 14:46.414
Good God, man, shut up!
Right, sorry.

14:46.416 --> 14:47.882
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:47.884 --> 14:50.051
You didn't tell me
we were doing this

14:50.053 --> 14:51.519
just to stick it to Sheldon.

14:51.521 --> 14:53.254
Oh, well...

14:53.256 --> 14:56.657
I messing with you. This sundae
just got a cherry on top!

14:57.994 --> 15:00.728
Fine. Good luck to you.

15:00.730 --> 15:02.797
The military is already
interested in my system,

15:02.799 --> 15:04.298
and my math is worked out.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.000
His still has a big gap in it.

15:06.002 --> 15:07.334
Where?

15:08.171 --> 15:10.004
There.

15:13.376 --> 15:16.043
- - Can I ask you a question?
Mm?

15:16.045 --> 15:18.679
Does a drug still count
as an antidepressant

15:18.681 --> 15:22.883
if its number one side effect
is uncontrollable weeping?

15:22.885 --> 15:27.488
I don't know. I always feel
better after a good cry.

15:27.490 --> 15:28.989
I've been trying
to ask Bernadette,

15:28.991 --> 15:31.559
but she's not answering
any of my texts.

15:31.561 --> 15:33.661
Yeah, uh, listen,
I think she might be

15:33.663 --> 15:35.496
a little threatened
by you, you know,

15:35.498 --> 15:38.766
because you can tie your own
shoes and laugh without peeing.

15:38.768 --> 15:40.735
Did she say something to you?

15:40.737 --> 15:42.269
No.

15:42.271 --> 15:44.004
I mean, well, kind of.

15:44.006 --> 15:45.506
But it's okay.
She's just hormonal.

15:45.508 --> 15:47.575
And, you know, don't worry,
I stood up for you.

15:47.577 --> 15:50.144
I don't need you
to stand up for me.

15:50.146 --> 15:51.545
You're not my boyfriend.

15:51.547 --> 15:53.681
Look, I care about you,

15:53.683 --> 15:56.383
and you can say that
this doesn't mean anything,

15:56.385 --> 15:58.152
but the truth is we're in
a relationship, okay?

15:58.154 --> 16:00.821
And you're gonna have to figure
out some way to deal with it.

16:01.891 --> 16:05.826
I can't believe
she dumped me.

16:05.828 --> 16:08.395
This is tough for
me, 'cause I can.

16:13.336 --> 16:16.337
Sorry things worked
out like that.

16:16.339 --> 16:19.607
Because I'm in pain or because
you don't have a spy anymore?

16:19.609 --> 16:21.242
Let's just leave
it at "I'm sorry."

16:21.244 --> 16:24.178
You're already sad.

16:25.348 --> 16:27.448
Based on Kripke's
calculations,

16:27.450 --> 16:29.116
I think this
is gonna work.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.051
Maybe we should pitch it
to Colonel Williams today.

16:31.053 --> 16:33.120
Why limit ourselves
to the U.S. military?

16:33.122 --> 16:35.723
I bet there's a lot of
other places we could take this.

16:35.725 --> 16:38.092
Without committing
criminal espionage?

16:38.094 --> 16:40.995
You know, it's easy
to shoot an idea down, Leonard.

16:42.498 --> 16:45.466
Well, I suppose
congratulations are in order.

16:45.468 --> 16:48.469
You set out to destroy me,
and you achieved your goal.

16:48.471 --> 16:49.603
What are you talking about?

16:49.605 --> 16:51.372
The military
canceled my project,

16:51.374 --> 16:53.140
because they're
going with yours.

16:53.142 --> 16:56.443
That's impossible.
We haven't even pitched it yet.

16:56.445 --> 16:58.479
Well, Colonel Williams said
another team at Caltech

16:58.481 --> 17:00.948
came up with a more efficient
neutrino comm system.

17:00.950 --> 17:02.149
Damn it!

17:03.686 --> 17:05.752
Excuse us.

17:05.755 --> 17:07.421
Kripke.

17:07.423 --> 17:09.656
What's up, fellas?

17:09.659 --> 17:10.958
Did you screw us over?

17:10.960 --> 17:12.693
Ooh, I can't tell you that.

17:12.694 --> 17:14.528
It's classified.

17:19.156 --> 17:21.690
Why did you tell
Barry Kripke your idea?

17:21.692 --> 17:23.058
This is all your fault.

17:23.060 --> 17:24.292
No, it's your fault.

17:24.295 --> 17:25.961
If you would've come to us
in the beginning,

17:25.963 --> 17:27.463
none of this would've happened.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.265
Well, if it helps,
you all behaved terribly

17:29.267 --> 17:31.200
and you deserve
what you got.

17:31.202 --> 17:33.936
Well, that doesn't help at all.

17:33.938 --> 17:37.173
You know, sometimes your
social skills are very poor.

17:38.242 --> 17:41.944
Can't believe we let
Kripke use us like that.

17:41.946 --> 17:43.979
You know, maybe you're all
more like the guy

17:43.981 --> 17:46.582
who didn't invent
the electric car

17:46.584 --> 17:51.387
and less like the guy
who didn't invent the lightbulb.

17:54.492 --> 17:58.761
She's right. Maybe we're all
a bunch of Teslas after all.

17:58.763 --> 18:02.131
Didn't Tesla die penniless,
forgotten and insane?

18:02.133 --> 18:05.501
You may have a point
about her social skills.

18:06.437 --> 18:07.803
He wasn't insane.

18:07.805 --> 18:10.206
He did fall in love
with a pigeon.

18:10.208 --> 18:11.707
Well, if we're gonna
call Tesla crazy

18:11.709 --> 18:13.475
for loving something
small and unappealing,

18:13.477 --> 18:15.744
might as well put Penny
in a padded cell right now.
