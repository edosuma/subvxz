WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:59.755 --> 02:01.051
I'd say your new training

02:01.076 --> 02:02.786
equipment is a success, Duncan.

02:03.625 --> 02:06.664
What's left of it you mean?
We can pick up the pieces later,

02:06.689 --> 02:09.801
right now Prince Adam is going
to be late for dinner unless...

02:09.826 --> 02:11.067
I hurry.

02:11.398 --> 02:12.465
Well, I'll see you there.

02:27.177 --> 02:31.668
Good evening, ladies and lords!
I thought there'd be a full house tonight.

02:32.656 --> 02:35.336
But no matter,
Orko the Great will entertain you

02:35.361 --> 02:37.875
all with a dazzling
display of amazing magic.

02:39.188 --> 02:41.269
Hey, that's not supposed to happen.

02:41.927 --> 02:45.423
It'd really be amazing if he ever
learns how to work that silly wand.

02:46.325 --> 02:47.325
Father.

02:47.442 --> 02:50.894
I heard that Man-At-Arms. You better have
some respect for my magic, or I'll...

02:52.723 --> 02:53.736
Oh, just watch this!

02:59.261 --> 03:03.196
And now the tricky part, I must have
absolute silence, I must concentrate.

03:04.838 --> 03:05.937
Concentrate...

03:12.989 --> 03:13.989
Bravo!

03:18.780 --> 03:21.032
Greetings Mother, Father. Sorry I'm late.

03:22.761 --> 03:25.014
Perfect timing, as usual, Prince Adam.

03:25.328 --> 03:26.526
Sorry Orko.

03:26.551 --> 03:29.343
You could at least make an
effort to get here on time.

03:29.628 --> 03:34.303
Sorry Teela, but you know how time
flies when you're... heh... having fun.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.404
That's the trouble.
You're ALWAYS having fun.

03:37.490 --> 03:41.001
Really, son. Such conduct
is not worthy of a future king.

03:41.639 --> 03:45.141
I think Adam inherited from me what
we earthlings call a "sense of humor."

03:46.043 --> 03:49.073
Well he'll need more than that
if he wants to rule some day.

03:49.734 --> 03:53.022
I'll be ready, Father,
but not for a long, long time, I hope.

03:53.778 --> 03:56.713
Oh very well, son. On with the magic, Orko!

03:56.756 --> 03:58.093
Now you're talking, Your Majesty.

03:59.247 --> 04:03.764
Behold, Demon Dust, the very thing to
conjure up a fearful creature from beyond.

04:04.540 --> 04:07.615
Lucky for us, the biggest thing he's
ever conjured up was a rabbit.

04:11.339 --> 04:16.661
"Now, by the powers of wizard and
elf, I command you demon, show yourself."

04:19.176 --> 04:21.555
Look, the spell is working!

04:21.873 --> 04:23.353
It is?  Hey, it is.

04:30.279 --> 04:31.708
Galloping galaxy,
how'd I do that?

04:32.315 --> 04:34.578
That's no demon.
You can say that again.

04:36.275 --> 04:42.303
Forgive my sudden arrival, Your Highnesses.
I am Magestra, a traveling magician.

04:42.687 --> 04:47.344
I have come hoping to entertain you
all with my wondrous illusions.

04:47.707 --> 04:51.043
Welcome, Magestra!
I'm sure we'd all love to see your

04:51.068 --> 04:54.441
illusions, however we already
have a court magician.

04:55.035 --> 04:57.560
But father,
I don't think Orko would

04:57.585 --> 04:58.788
mind. Sharing the

04:58.813 --> 05:00.586
stage with one as talented

05:00.611 --> 05:02.720
and as fair as Magestra.
What?

05:02.744 --> 05:06.193
My thanks, little one. Here, for you!

05:07.663 --> 05:08.663
Show off.

05:08.787 --> 05:11.118
Proceed, Magestra. Let us have music, then!

05:11.526 --> 05:14.666
Harmonies pleasing to kingly ears.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.014
Huh, Big deal!

05:28.338 --> 05:32.849
And now, Your Majesties,
the most mystifying spell of all!

05:33.755 --> 05:38.525
Behold! The cabinet of wonders!
To all outside

05:38.550 --> 05:43.015
appearances, an ordinary box. But inside...

05:43.702 --> 05:45.798
Just what is inside?

05:47.611 --> 05:49.489
See for yourself, Sire.

05:54.047 --> 05:55.047
Now?

05:55.271 --> 06:00.402
"Spirits of magic from far and near,
make His Majesty disappear"!

06:04.581 --> 06:06.056
What evil wizardry is this?

06:09.126 --> 06:12.542
Wait, your king is unharmed. Here he is.

06:15.689 --> 06:17.138
That's some trick.

06:26.979 --> 06:31.400
Well, magic has certainly sharpened
your appetite. Your Highness?!

06:31.425 --> 06:35.354
Oh... oh, well done Magestra,
yes, very entertaining.

06:35.550 --> 06:37.967
I invite you to stay with us a while longer

06:37.992 --> 06:40.605
my dear. You're too kind, Sire.

06:40.890 --> 06:43.854
Come, I'll have the guards
show you to your room.

06:43.879 --> 06:46.782
Nicely done, fool.
You nearly ruined everything.

06:47.877 --> 06:50.281
You worry too much, no one suspects us.

06:51.287 --> 06:52.903
There's something funny going on here,

06:52.928 --> 06:54.655
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

07:03.936 --> 07:07.979
Arise, Your Highness,
and greet your guests.

07:08.004 --> 07:12.128
Oh. The last thing I remember,
I was in the banquet hall.

07:13.463 --> 07:18.492
What? It's impossible, it's me. You're
no simple magician, who are you?

07:18.654 --> 07:22.288
I see, the time for deception, has ended.

07:26.582 --> 07:31.902
Evil-Lyn! Beast Man! You fiends dare
to come to palace Eternia, itself?

07:32.076 --> 07:36.526
I dare anything, Your Highness.
Now that I wield the shaping staff.

07:36.551 --> 07:40.607
This legendary wand can transform
any matter in the universe.

07:41.061 --> 07:45.450
But the shaping staff is just a myth,
a fairy tale. It was just a myth,

07:45.475 --> 07:49.681
until Beast Man and I found it in
a hidden cave near the Crystal Sea.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.370
Soon, I will hand it over to my master,

07:52.512 --> 07:57.666
Skeletor.
But first, I decided to test the wand here.

07:58.267 --> 08:01.291
On you.
Let you who were once king of

08:01.316 --> 08:04.646
Eternia,
now be king of goats!

08:10.637 --> 08:16.759
Now, with you posing as the real King,
Beast Man, Skeletor will rule Eternia!

08:16.863 --> 08:17.863
Through you!

08:22.879 --> 08:23.879
Get him!

08:24.312 --> 08:25.826
We can't let him tell the others!

08:30.032 --> 08:35.636
Stop him! I-I'm trying,
but he jumps around like a blasted cricket.

08:36.001 --> 08:41.051
Huh? Then a cricket he shall be!
Prince Adam, Prince Adam...

08:44.234 --> 08:45.951
That takes care of him.

08:55.885 --> 09:00.086
Behold Skeletor, the Shaping
Staff, as I promised.

09:00.833 --> 09:05.703
Well done, Evil-Lyn!
Now we begin, Phase 2.

09:06.017 --> 09:08.837
Tomorrow Beast Man and I, in disguise,

09:08.862 --> 09:11.549
will lead the forces of
Eternia to Grayskull!

09:11.687 --> 09:15.857
There I will hand over the
Shaping Staff to you, and then...

09:15.882 --> 09:20.450
Then we shall defeat the forces
of Eternia, in one fell swoop!

09:25.407 --> 09:29.128
You be careful now.
You must make Prince Adam believe,

09:29.153 --> 09:32.253
that you are his father.
You worry too much.

09:32.594 --> 09:33.950
You sent for us, Sire?

09:36.594 --> 09:39.671
Yes, Adam,
I've been speaking with Magestra,

09:39.696 --> 09:42.156
about the old castle in the forest.

09:42.806 --> 09:45.846
It's time we made Grayskull,
a part of our kingdom.

09:47.356 --> 09:50.858
But why father?
What use could Grayskull be to us?

09:50.883 --> 09:54.166
If you've no taste for conquest,
you can stay behind.

09:54.201 --> 09:56.113
Man-At-Arms, ready the troops,

09:56.138 --> 09:58.112
we march tomorrow. Yes, Sire!

09:58.145 --> 10:00.278
But why this sudden interest in the castle?

10:00.303 --> 10:02.339
I mean surely there are more important...

10:02.476 --> 10:06.701
You're a fine one to talk of
importance, Adam. You, and your lazy ways.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.747
Come Magestra, we have much to do.

10:11.676 --> 10:14.662
It's not like my father'd
ever consider attacking,

10:14.687 --> 10:17.195
Grayskull. He's always been a man of peace.

10:17.226 --> 10:19.250
Well, maybe I can reason
with him in the morning.

10:19.306 --> 10:22.893
He's getting suspicious. Leave him to me.

10:22.918 --> 10:27.784
After tonight, we won't have
to worry about Prince Adam.

10:42.070 --> 10:47.091
Who's there? A-Adam, are you asleep yet?

10:47.116 --> 10:50.251
Cringer, what do you want
at this time of night?

10:52.113 --> 10:56.996
Well... it does get rather drafty
sleeping outside, y'know.

10:57.021 --> 11:02.523
T-To say nothing of... Scared, huh?
Alright, come on in, old cat.

11:05.995 --> 11:07.772
Now what?

11:08.797 --> 11:10.141
A cricket!

11:10.166 --> 11:12.917
A-Adam, it's me!
Orko!

11:12.943 --> 11:16.877
The king is a fake...
It's Beast Man with Evil-Lyn...

11:16.902 --> 11:18.657
Pl-Please help!

11:18.682 --> 11:21.193
If he's a fake,
where's my father?

11:21.355 --> 11:23.275
He's in the dungeon!

11:24.516 --> 11:29.718
Don't worry Orko, we'll help you, and
rescure my father. Let's go Cringer.

11:30.051 --> 11:33.855
Oh, Do we have to?
Do you want me to go alone?

11:33.880 --> 11:37.359
Y-You sure you w-want
me to answer that...

11:38.815 --> 11:41.355
By the power of Grayskull!

11:48.080 --> 11:51.570
I have the power!

11:52.366 --> 11:55.566
Oh, I hate this part.

12:08.406 --> 12:10.821
Good evening, Prince...
He-Man!

12:10.827 --> 12:13.128
Evil-Lyn and Beast Man!

12:13.153 --> 12:16.154
So, Adam's fears were right.

12:16.301 --> 12:19.870
Yes, my enemy, but you'll not stop us.

12:21.619 --> 12:25.843
My sword can deflect magical bolts,
Evil-Lyn, or didn't you know that?

12:25.912 --> 12:27.753
Beast Man, help me!

12:31.587 --> 12:35.617
Father, that noise!
I know. it came from Adam's room!

12:46.223 --> 12:47.476
I can't see!

12:51.453 --> 12:53.882
He-Man!  Evil-Lyn!

12:55.167 --> 13:00.398
Get back before she reaches that staff!
I already have it, fool!

13:01.280 --> 13:04.864
Ah, I can see again!
Although you can deflect

13:04.889 --> 13:08.004
the Staff's magic, your friends cannot.

13:12.650 --> 13:13.650
Teela...

13:14.932 --> 13:19.204
Surrender He-Man,
or Teela will remain a little frog forever!

13:20.486 --> 13:26.202
Now, for you... First,
free Teela from your spell! No!

13:26.227 --> 13:30.533
She will join the others, in my menagerie.

13:30.558 --> 13:32.209
Don't you recognize them, He-Man?

13:32.255 --> 13:37.022
It's the former King of
Eternia, and his court clown.

13:37.276 --> 13:42.334
Release them, you evil witch, or I'll...
You'll do nothing!

13:42.700 --> 13:50.387
Except change. There.
A handsome golden present, for Skeletor!

13:54.753 --> 13:56.553
Gotcha!
Bah!

13:56.618 --> 14:00.065
You two are not worth
bothering about. To Grayskull!

14:15.434 --> 14:19.419
I will make another He-Man,
an evil one, called Faker!

14:23.365 --> 14:27.400
I have done it!
A perfect likeness of He-Man!

14:27.425 --> 14:30.581
Sometimes my power, even amazes me.

14:30.894 --> 14:35.266
Faker, you must get the Sorceress
to leave Grayskull. Outside

14:35.291 --> 14:39.310
the castle, her magic is
weaker, and I can overpower her.

14:40.018 --> 14:44.024
In this dim light,
she'll think you're He-Man.

14:44.149 --> 14:47.358
Call her, Faker! Yes, master.

14:47.489 --> 14:53.184
Sorceress, Sorceress, please hear me!
He-Man!

14:57.243 --> 14:59.531
What brings you here at this hour?

14:59.556 --> 15:02.366
I've been hurt. There's something wrong...

15:03.168 --> 15:05.156
Your voice sounds
different, He-Man.

15:05.181 --> 15:07.556
That's because I was ambushed,

15:07.581 --> 15:11.719
by Skeletor. I-I can't think clearly.

15:11.925 --> 15:14.924
Stay there, I'll come to you.

15:24.777 --> 15:27.811
Where are you?
Right here, Sorceress!

15:28.236 --> 15:29.347
Evil-Lyn!

15:31.014 --> 15:32.784
You should not have left your castle!

15:33.109 --> 15:36.305
Here my power is as strong as yours!

15:37.472 --> 15:42.023
Now that you're here, perhaps you'd
like a taste of the Shaping Staff.

15:42.360 --> 15:46.860
Remain rooted to that spot forever,
Sorceress, as a harmless tree.

15:48.273 --> 15:49.273
No!

15:51.139 --> 15:52.139
No!

15:59.067 --> 16:02.664
Very good Evil-Lyn!
I could have taken care of her myself,

16:02.689 --> 16:06.144
of course, but this fate is more fitting.

16:06.563 --> 16:11.254
Soon, Man-At-Arms will lead his troops
here to rescue He-Man and his friends.

16:11.416 --> 16:14.852
Let them come!
I'll face them with the combined

16:14.877 --> 16:18.502
powers of the shaping
staff, and Castle Grayskull.

16:18.523 --> 16:22.472
Sorceress, even in this transformed
state, I can still

16:22.497 --> 16:26.517
sense your thoughts.
Use your magic to break the spell.

16:26.697 --> 16:32.909
I-I can't. Evil-Lyn's power...
Too strong. Can't...

16:32.934 --> 16:38.309
Resist. You've got to
try, for all our sakes.

16:38.530 --> 16:44.422
Yes, must try.
Must... break the spell.

16:51.169 --> 16:53.030
Quick Skeletor!  The wand!

16:53.084 --> 16:55.804
We don't need a wand.
Not with Faker here.

17:04.912 --> 17:10.006
You, forget, He-Man, I have your power too.

17:10.618 --> 17:13.422
Let's see how well you can use that power.

17:17.301 --> 17:20.109
How do you like that, Hero? I don't

17:20.135 --> 17:23.333
like it Faker, and I like you even less.

17:28.342 --> 17:32.709
It's a long way down, He-Man.
Need a hand?

17:32.796 --> 17:36.910
In this case, a leg will do, just fine.

17:42.369 --> 17:43.692
Wait, stop!

17:52.725 --> 17:56.637
With this staff I can rescue
Faker from the bottomless gorge,

17:56.662 --> 17:59.942
but first you and I,
have some unfinished business.

18:27.089 --> 18:30.088
Have a nice trip down, Man-At-Arms!

18:30.534 --> 18:32.210
I must break his fall.

18:38.666 --> 18:41.843
Meddler, you'll pay for that.

18:48.625 --> 18:52.179
The staff... Get the staff.
Oh no you don't.

18:54.673 --> 19:00.528
The only way to break your evil spell
is like this. Thanks, He-Man.

19:00.830 --> 19:03.173
C'mon, let's get out of here. No,

19:03.198 --> 19:05.848
the staff is still strong
enough to stop them.

19:07.469 --> 19:12.495
Fools, with one wave of this
wand, I'll turn you all into...

19:17.764 --> 19:20.593
That'll teach you to
fool around with magic.

19:20.641 --> 19:25.691
Curse you all!
Once I've restored Evil-Lyn and Faker,

19:25.716 --> 19:30.671
I'll be back to have vengeance!
So swears, Skeletor!

19:35.860 --> 19:38.422
Well,
it's good to be on the throne.

19:38.547 --> 19:39.952
It's good to have you back, Father.

19:40.227 --> 19:45.380
And i-i-it's good to have you back,
little buddy. Thanks Cringe.

19:45.405 --> 19:47.772
Y'now I don't think I'd
like to be a cricket,

19:47.797 --> 19:50.112
but I sure wish I knew
how to do that trick.

19:50.256 --> 19:54.889
Adam, it's too bad you weren't around.
We certainly could have used some help.

19:55.373 --> 20:00.859
Thank goodness, He-Man showed up.
Funny, he's always there when we need him.

20:01.009 --> 20:03.030
Well, I hope I can
meet him someday. I'd

20:03.055 --> 20:05.273
really like to thank
him for helping us out.

20:05.354 --> 20:08.102
And for bringing my father back.
Thank you,

20:08.127 --> 20:10.936
son and now I think we
all deserve some fun.

20:11.096 --> 20:13.020
Orko, let's have some magic!

20:13.215 --> 20:16.948
Your wish is my command.
Now, for my first trick...

20:17.096 --> 20:23.044
For my first trick, I'm gonna disappear...

20:31.401 --> 20:34.770
In today's story, you saw what happened
when a stranger came to the palace,

20:34.854 --> 20:37.469
she turned out to be evil and dangerous.
Of course,

20:37.494 --> 20:40.033
turning people into animals
is only make-believe,

20:40.058 --> 20:42.289
but there is nothing make-believe about how

20:42.314 --> 20:44.621
dangerous some strangers
can be in real life.

20:44.647 --> 20:48.405
Never accept any food or toys or
money from strangers. Don't even talk

20:48.430 --> 20:52.081
to them. No matter what a stranger may
say, never go away with them.

20:52.162 --> 20:54.733
Terrible things have happened
to some kids who did.

20:54.873 --> 20:58.089
The smart thing is to just walk
away, or in my case just float away.
