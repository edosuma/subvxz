[grunts]

00:12.846 --> 00:14.055
Perfect.

00:17.058 --> 00:19.310
What are you doing to me?

00:20.437 --> 00:22.355
[Dr. Reznick] <i>Not the results</i>
<i>we'd hoped for.</i>

00:22.439 --> 00:25.150
Your labs confirm
what we saw on the ultrasound.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.193
You're in end-stage liver disease.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.446
But I always took my medicine.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.363
I know.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.699
You're the most compliant patient I have.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.243
But autoimmune hepatitis can progress

00:35.326 --> 00:36.494
even with treatment.

00:37.537 --> 00:38.955
You need a liver transplant.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.999
We talked about that before, remember?

00:42.834 --> 00:45.420
But you're gonna have
a fantastic team of surgeons

00:45.503 --> 00:47.547
working their tails off
to get you fixed up.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.341
We're gonna get you admitted.

00:50.425 --> 00:51.843
Do you have any questions?

00:54.095 --> 00:55.930
Someone has to die

00:56.014 --> 00:57.849
so I can live?

01:08.526 --> 01:09.527
[sighs]

01:09.611 --> 01:11.029
I want to pray,

01:11.112 --> 01:15.241
but I can't pray for someone else to die.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.541
[elevator bell dings, doors close]

01:23.625 --> 01:25.001
Ooh, hold the door!

01:26.127 --> 01:27.545
[sighs] Oh.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.798
Thank you! I'm late enough already.

01:30.757 --> 01:31.758
[sighs]

01:31.841 --> 01:33.134
What happened to you?

01:33.218 --> 01:34.219
Oh, not much.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.387
Just slept through my alarm,
stubbed my toe,

01:36.471 --> 01:38.139
got a parking ticket and a flat tire.

01:38.223 --> 01:41.309
You have a 50-year-old relic,
and you don't use Triple A?

01:41.392 --> 01:42.977
I drive a 44-year-old car,

01:43.061 --> 01:44.521
and it takes longer
to wait for help

01:44.604 --> 01:46.189
than it is
to put the spare on myself.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.733
-Surprised you know how to use it.
-Because I'm a woman?

01:48.817 --> 01:49.943
Because you're a millennial.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.195
I'm an engineer who used
to work for a car company.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.863
A computer company.
You built software.

01:53.947 --> 01:54.864
For self-driving cars.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.534
Sony is a car company
'cause they built stereos for cars…

01:57.617 --> 01:59.702
My point is I obviously know
how to change a tire

01:59.786 --> 02:01.579
faster than
any tow truck driver or you.

02:01.663 --> 02:04.624
Okay. No need to be hostile.
I'm just trying to make conversation.

02:04.707 --> 02:06.209
[elevator bell dings, doors open]

02:07.836 --> 02:09.045
Have a nice day.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.010
-What do you got?
-He almost drowned in the triathlon.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.846
We restarted his heart,
but he's obtunded,

02:17.929 --> 02:19.097
and breathing's labored.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.015
He was in the triathlon?

02:21.099 --> 02:24.519
Agonal respiration
with accessory muscle use.

02:24.602 --> 02:25.854
His sats are dropping.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.605
-It's Cort Graham.
-Eight liters oxygen.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.107
Are we supposed to know
who that is?

02:29.190 --> 02:31.401
Cancer survivor and endurance athlete.

02:31.484 --> 02:32.902
Also heads a big cancer charity.

-and fluid collection.
-[beeping]

02:36.030 --> 02:37.282
-I need a chest tube.
-On it.

02:37.365 --> 02:40.201
If he's an experienced swimmer,
something made him pass out.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.828
Could be a heart attack. Stroke.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.413
Head trauma? From swimming?

02:43.496 --> 02:44.664
I did a sprint tri once.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.624
The swim was like
a roller derby in water.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.376
Damn it. Pyxis won't open.

02:48.459 --> 02:50.378
I tried to put in my code,
but nothing happens.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.630
Well, figure it out.
We need the chest tube.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.675
I'm going to go in with a 10 blade.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.176
That won't release enough fluid.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.344
I know.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.226
Come on!

03:05.310 --> 03:06.978
[monitor alarm]

03:07.061 --> 03:08.688
He's cyanotic.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.815
Ugh! Come on, open!

03:10.899 --> 03:12.400
[Claire] Get out of the way.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.448
[glass shatters]

03:22.327 --> 03:23.953
Don't just stand there. Get the tube.

03:24.996 --> 03:25.997
Sorry. Sorry.

03:29.918 --> 03:32.086
What's going on? Why didn't it open?

03:32.170 --> 03:34.756
I don't know. The power's on,
but our computers are down.

03:34.839 --> 03:36.174
All of them? The whole hospital?

03:36.257 --> 03:37.467
Looks that way.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.559
[theme music playing]

03:54.901 --> 03:57.445
We'll need to temporarily close
the clinic, ER,

03:57.528 --> 03:58.696
and divert new patients.

03:58.780 --> 03:59.614
Good news is,

03:59.697 --> 04:01.699
the ORs are isolated from the network,

04:01.783 --> 04:04.410
so we won't be able to share imaging
on external monitors,

04:04.494 --> 04:07.038
but the MRI and radiology machines
are still functional.

04:07.121 --> 04:10.041
Well, great.
Let's postpone all elective procedures,

04:10.124 --> 04:12.252
keep the most urgent cases on the board.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.336
Got it.

04:13.836 --> 04:14.837
You call the cops?

04:14.921 --> 04:16.464
San Jose Police and the FBI

04:16.547 --> 04:19.217
and the Cyber Attack insurance carrier.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.052
-What's the ransom?
-[elevator bell dings]

04:21.135 --> 04:21.970
Two million.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.098
Well, we have the data backed up.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.100
Got it covered.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.144
[electronic warbling]

04:30.228 --> 04:31.813
We got a problem.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.231
If it's only one problem,

04:33.314 --> 04:35.024
it'll make me extraordinarily happy.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.067
No, it won't.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.861
They actually hacked into the network
over three months ago.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.197
Took their time to not only
encrypt our servers

04:41.281 --> 04:43.366
but our on-site
and cloud-based backups.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.201
Don't we have backups, data?

04:45.285 --> 04:46.494
Actually, we have three,

04:46.577 --> 04:48.204
which get rotated out every 30 days,

04:48.288 --> 04:50.248
which means the oldest backup we have

04:50.331 --> 04:53.042
was synched four days
after the bastards broke in.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.419
We have no data?

04:54.502 --> 04:55.962
Technically, we still have data.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.464
We just can't access it
without their encryption key.

05:00.174 --> 05:01.009
Okay.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.177
You can't pay the ransom.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.804
You don't negotiate with terrorists.

05:04.887 --> 05:07.724
What I can't do is pay
an exorbitant amount of money

05:07.807 --> 05:09.809
to an insurance company
and then not use them.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.602
They gave us 24 hours to get the Bitcoin.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.980
If I can find a mistake
in their encryption software,

05:14.063 --> 05:15.773
I might be able
to get our data back.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.151
Of course, I'll also have
to retrace the attack chain

05:18.234 --> 05:19.777
to find the exact door
they came in.

05:19.861 --> 05:23.740
Otherwise, we might as well toss every
computer we have in the recycle… bin.

05:23.823 --> 05:26.534
If you're trying to convince me
to not pay the ransom,

05:26.617 --> 05:29.037
you maybe shouldn't have said
that last part.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.705
I realized that as I was saying it.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.541
[sighs]

05:35.877 --> 05:37.712
You've got 24 hours.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.762
The surgery shouldn't be a problem,
but finding a liver will be.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.180
Her MELD score puts her first up.

05:47.263 --> 05:50.933
On our list, still leaves her competing
with every patient in the region.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.019
No procurement coordinator is
gonna discriminate

05:53.102 --> 05:56.147
against a patient with Down Syndrome,
but they will give a patient

05:56.230 --> 05:58.149
with shorter life expectancy
a low priority.

05:58.232 --> 06:01.277
She also lives alone and doesn't have
family to help with recovery.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.614
She's worked hard to be independent,
and it's gonna be held against her?

06:04.697 --> 06:06.532
It sucks, but it's not unfair.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.117
I'm not giving up.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.914
You don't have to worry about the list
if you can find a living donor.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.416
Look for one who's already
volunteered to give a kidney.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.086
Get help. With the network down,
it'll take longer,

06:18.169 --> 06:19.754
and she doesn't have much time.

06:22.965 --> 06:25.802
I couldn't have gotten kicked.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.553
Wasn't even close to the pack.

06:27.637 --> 06:28.513
[chuckles]

06:28.596 --> 06:30.389
I thought swim
was your strongest section.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.810
Usually, but I let my ego
get the best of me.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.770
I went out way too fast

06:35.853 --> 06:37.563
and got dropped at the first turn.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.607
Well, I'm impressed
you're even out there.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.192
I can barely finish a 5K.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.069
I used to be the same way, too.

06:43.152 --> 06:45.113
Cancer actually made me a better runner.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.572
That can't be true.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.741
The chemo you had
reduces lung capacity,

06:48.825 --> 06:51.577
and how could losing a leg
make you a faster runner?

06:51.661 --> 06:54.330
Well, once you get past a mile,
it's not about speed.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.667
It's about pain and how much
you're willing to push through.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.502
And my threshold definitely increased

06:59.585 --> 07:00.795
after chemo and rehab.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.881
And seeing the hope I give survivors

07:03.965 --> 07:07.135
every single time
that I cross the finish line,

07:07.218 --> 07:08.553
that doesn't hurt either.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.513
His cancer could be back.

07:10.596 --> 07:13.141
The odds of sarcoma reoccurrence
are very high.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.725
[Claire] It could be lots of things.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.769
It could be a virus or bacteria.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.062
More likely cancer.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.648
Overtraining can weaken
the immune system.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.317
I'm a motivational speaker,

07:23.401 --> 07:25.486
so literally a professional optimist.

07:25.570 --> 07:26.571
[chuckles]

07:26.654 --> 07:28.281
I can handle the truth.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.575
Dr. Murphy is probably right,

07:30.658 --> 07:33.870
but we'll do a full blood panel
and chest CT to be sure.

07:36.914 --> 07:39.876
The good news is,
it's clearly an underfunded startup.

07:39.959 --> 07:43.254
Their website's garbage, the ransom's
only half your cyber policy limit.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.089
Underfunded? Startup?

07:45.173 --> 07:46.966
Website? Where do I start?

07:47.049 --> 07:50.219
Despite what you see on TV,
these attacks don't come from lone wolves.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.471
It's a global business.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.723
With websites
and customer service call centers.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.099
Our IT Director thinks

07:55.183 --> 07:56.934
that we might be able
to decrypt the data.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.103
Even if he could do that,
which is impossible,

07:59.187 --> 08:01.314
it wouldn't do any good
unless he can also retrace

08:01.397 --> 08:02.482
the entire attack chain.

08:02.565 --> 08:03.983
She explained that.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.528
She also said that
she might be able to do both.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.489
I'm sure your IT Director's excellent.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.990
I'm also sure

08:11.073 --> 08:13.326
that this is outside
her area of expertise.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.369
The only way to retrieve your data

08:15.453 --> 08:16.287
is to pay the fee.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.040
Now, I'm sure I can negotiate it down
to a few hundred grand.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.208
From two million?

08:20.291 --> 08:22.001
Well, they're amateurs.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.294
I'm not.

She's about to close
the most important deal of her life.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.058
Retired firefighter,
peak physical condition.

08:37.141 --> 08:38.184
I did.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.520
He was at a bar at 3:00 p.m.

08:40.603 --> 08:43.564
Doesn't give me hope that
his liver will be in perfect condition.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.691
Mm, not ideal, but not disqualifying.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.652
Rachel Trainor is a better option.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.071
She's local, preschool teacher,

08:50.154 --> 08:52.114
and an extremely devout Christian.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.116
What makes you think
her faith helps us?

08:55.743 --> 08:57.495
I'm a devout Christian, and I'm not sure

08:57.578 --> 08:59.622
I'd be a live liver donor
for a family member,

08:59.705 --> 09:00.957
much less a stranger.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.167
Well, you may be devout,
but you're also selfish.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.506
Um, we all are,

09:08.589 --> 09:10.091
relatively speaking.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.426
So what makes you think Rachel isn't?

09:12.510 --> 09:13.511
Her Instagram.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.930
I mean, you'd be surprised
by how much you can learn

09:16.013 --> 09:17.181
from what people "like,"

09:17.265 --> 09:19.517
and Rachel likes everything she sees.

Like, literally everything.

[elevator bell dings]

09:26.440 --> 09:28.401
We rescheduled
the chemo appointments we could,

09:28.484 --> 09:30.903
but there's still three
that need their infusions today.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.822
We're doing our best
to modify the regimens.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.991
Okay. Check and see
if they got second opinions

09:35.074 --> 09:37.159
from other oncologists. And if so,

09:37.243 --> 09:40.079
-then maybe we can use those records.
-Okay.

09:40.162 --> 09:42.331
-And keep me posted.
-Yes.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.292
What the hell?

09:45.167 --> 09:46.544
You said I had 24 hours.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.838
God, you're gonna
give me a heart attack.

09:48.921 --> 09:52.341
I authorized a negotiation.
I didn't authorize a payment.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.718
You don't trust me?

09:53.801 --> 09:56.387
It's not about trust. It's about

09:56.470 --> 09:58.097
weighing the costs of a delay.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.600
Well, then you should know
your costs just went up.

10:02.476 --> 10:04.312
They sent us a Signal text.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.649
What's a bot worm?

10:08.733 --> 10:11.193
It's what happens when
you listen to an insurance rep

10:11.277 --> 10:13.029
instead of your own Head of IT.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.574
They were insulted by the offer,

10:16.657 --> 10:19.535
so they doubled the ransom
and activated malware.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.787
If we don't pay,
they're gonna delete our data

10:21.871 --> 10:25.291
and destroy all of our MRI, CT,
and X-ray machines.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.844
They obviously just figured out
what the policy limit is,

10:36.927 --> 10:39.597
which means they didn't do their research
and are improvising.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.681
They're playing catch-up.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.017
Can we still get them down
to a few hundred K?

10:43.100 --> 10:45.311
No. That was before
they had the policy information.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.188
Now we'll end up somewhere between

10:47.271 --> 10:48.731
their initial and current demands.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.400
This is just a piece of paper
and a check to you, isn't it?

10:51.484 --> 10:54.612
You're upset because your insurance rep
wants to promptly pay a claim?

10:54.695 --> 10:56.947
The frequency of these attacks
is skyrocketing

10:57.031 --> 10:59.408
because insurance companies
make it so easy to collect.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.911
I'd quibble with the analysis
but accept the compliment.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.205
It's just a matter of time
before they kill someone.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.165
Do you have a solution or just a lecture?

11:06.248 --> 11:07.667
Give me the time I asked for

11:07.750 --> 11:09.710
to decrypt the data
and restore the network.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.338
-Not gonna be able to restore…
-How do you even know that?

11:12.421 --> 11:13.381
Never seen it done.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.299
-It would take a 1000 years
-I'm not running

11:15.383 --> 11:17.134
-a brute force…
-to run all the sequences.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.427
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

11:18.511 --> 11:19.595
Enough.

11:19.678 --> 11:21.889
Your solutions aren't mutually exclusive.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.182
You keep negotiating,

11:23.265 --> 11:26.352
and you do whatever you do
to get the network back online.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.773
[door opens]

11:30.856 --> 11:32.191
[door closes]

11:33.150 --> 11:34.443
We have some good news.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.821
Your cancer hasn't returned.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.155
You have a fungal infection

11:38.239 --> 11:40.449
that is causing a bleed
in your left lung.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.034
-That's great.
-No, it's not.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.787
The best treatment is surgical excision
of the infected lobe,

11:44.870 --> 11:45.704
but we can't do that

11:45.788 --> 11:48.416
because of scarring from the Bleomycin
you were treated with

11:48.499 --> 11:49.667
during chemotherapy.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.670
They always do this good cop,
bad cop thing?

11:52.753 --> 11:54.547
-Um…
-I'm sorry.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.133
Dr. Murphy just has
a more direct bedside manner.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.926
That's good. I like direct.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.595
You can't climb an obstacle
until you're facing it head-on.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.306
We're gonna start you on
an anti-fungal drug.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.933
If surgery's the best,

12:06.016 --> 12:07.226
that's what I want.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.730
The chemo was over 10 years ago.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.983
Bleomycin weakens the lungs permanently.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.526
For most people.

12:15.609 --> 12:17.987
I climbed five of the Seven Summits
with these lungs.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.031
It's my decision.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.366
I want the surgery.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.286
I'm sorry, but sometimes

12:25.369 --> 12:27.455
a positive attitude just isn't enough.

12:27.538 --> 12:30.541
We may have to try you
on several different drugs

12:30.624 --> 12:32.001
before we see some improvement,

12:32.084 --> 12:34.211
so you're gonna have to be patient.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.381
It's not one of my strengths.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.382
Me neither.

12:38.466 --> 12:41.302
But we're gonna get through this together.

12:47.850 --> 12:51.353
Turkey, avocado, and Swiss
on wheat bread with mayonnaise.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.272
It's your favorite.

12:53.355 --> 12:54.356
I don't have time.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.443
Low blood sugar can decrease
your ability to concentrate.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.862
I've had five energy drinks
and three granola bars.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.030
Okay.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.203
I have an interesting patient.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.955
He said he thought
cancer made him stronger,

13:10.039 --> 13:12.458
-but that is obviously not true…
-Shaun!

13:14.960 --> 13:17.922
Would you walk in on Glassman
while he's doing brain surgery,

13:18.005 --> 13:19.590
offer him a sandwich,

13:19.673 --> 13:21.592
and start telling him about your day?

13:22.218 --> 13:23.636
That's different.

13:24.887 --> 13:25.888
Of course.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.974
Because his job's important
and mine's not.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.019
Do you have any idea

13:32.102 --> 13:34.522
how insulting it is
to hear you demean what I do,

13:34.605 --> 13:37.107
just like every man
I've worked under and over

13:37.191 --> 13:38.108
my whole career?

13:38.943 --> 13:39.777
You…

13:41.529 --> 13:43.364
You don't respect me.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.787
You can't bring sandwiches into an OR.

14:00.839 --> 14:01.924
I have to go.

14:09.473 --> 14:11.183
-[Rachel] Ah.
-[chuckles]

14:11.267 --> 14:12.476
King me.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.561
Hmm.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.940
We have a problem.

14:19.066 --> 14:21.110
Am I too sick for the transplant?

14:22.152 --> 14:23.153
No.

14:23.612 --> 14:24.989
But you are.

14:25.072 --> 14:28.826
Your bloodwork indicates
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.370
It's a minor case which should
be manageable with diet,

14:31.453 --> 14:34.832
but it means you can't be a liver donor.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.589
Wouldn't a fatty liver
be better than nothing?

14:41.672 --> 14:43.299
It wouldn't be safe for either of you.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.552
There has to be another way.

14:47.344 --> 14:50.431
-[voice breaking] We can't give up.
-We're not giving up, but…

14:55.227 --> 14:57.146
Thank you for trying to help me.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.775
I'm sorry you are sick, too.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.830
Your kidney is fine.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.665
Would you be willing to donate it?

15:17.249 --> 15:19.001
Uh, of course.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.295
But how does that help Jamie?

15:21.378 --> 15:23.797
You might be able to save
two lives with one kidney.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.345
-[monitor alarm]
-What's going on?

15:29.428 --> 15:31.347
Blood oxygen level dropping.
He's hypoxic.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.515
[exhales sharply]

15:33.599 --> 15:36.018
The anti-fungal regiment
isn't working, but don't worry.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.854
-There are other drugs we can try.
-I want the surgery. Please.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.564
I'll take the risk, whatever it is.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.358
Not a risk. It's a guarantee.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.193
Increase voriconazole
by 320 milligrams

15:44.276 --> 15:46.195
and add Amphotericin
at 24 milligrams.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.906
-We may need to intubate you.
-Stop! Stop.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.201
I would survive the surgery.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.702
-No, you…
-Yes.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.329
I would.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.207
Because I never had the drug.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.503
Because I never had cancer.

16:15.683 --> 16:18.060
[Dr. Lim] So, how'd he lose his leg?

16:18.143 --> 16:20.729
Drunken motorcycle accident
when he was 22.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.897
It's good news.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.860
Now we can give him
the surgery he needs.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.321
No way. He needs to find new doctors,

16:29.405 --> 16:32.157
and we need to figure out a way
to alert the charity.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.827
He faked cancer
so he could steal money,

16:34.910 --> 16:36.996
date models, and get his face
on a Wheaties box.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.832
He didn't steal the money.
He gave it all to charity.

16:39.915 --> 16:41.834
I don't care what he did with it
after he lied

16:41.917 --> 16:43.627
and cheated
thousands of people to get it.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.629
He should be in prison, not our OR.

16:45.713 --> 16:48.090
Can we even do that?
Refuse to treat him?

16:48.173 --> 16:50.718
We refuse to treat
noncompliant patients all the time.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.177
What's going on?

16:52.261 --> 16:55.180
I mean, he's obviously not
the first patient who's lied to you.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.682
[sighs]

16:56.765 --> 16:59.560
He didn't just hide
how much he smokes or drinks.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.061
He weaponized people's empathy,

17:01.145 --> 17:02.896
and he kept pushing his lie

17:02.980 --> 17:04.648
until he was some sort
of national hero.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.692
-How does that not piss you off?
-It does.

17:06.775 --> 17:09.194
But I can be pissed off
and professional.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.241
Get him prepped for surgery.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.663
A multi-organ chain.

17:19.747 --> 17:22.916
We need to find someone who wants
to give a kidney to their loved one

17:23.000 --> 17:25.878
but isn't a match,
but is a match to Jamie.

17:25.961 --> 17:28.088
And the loved one has to be
a match to Rachel.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.215
We have to match blood
and tissue types,

17:30.299 --> 17:31.216
as well as organ size,

17:31.300 --> 17:33.719
and kidneys and livers have
different test requirements.

17:33.802 --> 17:35.888
And we need another donor
willing to do a surgery

17:35.971 --> 17:38.891
that's more painful and dangerous
than the one they signed up for.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.059
Twice the challenge.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.769
To save twice as many lives.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.730
Park and I will start
calling hospitals.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.648
Asher, back to social-media stalking.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.609
Jordan, check local news reports

17:48.692 --> 17:51.111
and any other corner
of the Internet you can scour.

17:59.161 --> 18:02.039
Stay back or you're gonna
contaminate my clean room.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.042
I found an error.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.585
Not theirs. Ours.

18:06.668 --> 18:09.296
The serial numbers on the server
didn't match up.

18:09.379 --> 18:12.382
Turns out one of my techs
spilled coffee on a server,

18:12.466 --> 18:13.509
didn't want to tell me,

18:13.592 --> 18:16.220
so he switched it out
three days before the hack.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.722
His screw-up might just save our ass.

18:19.932 --> 18:20.933
[sighs]

18:21.016 --> 18:22.476
So it's not encrypted?

18:22.559 --> 18:26.563
No, but it is corrupted
from the coffee and dust and dirt.

18:26.647 --> 18:29.691
I found it under a pile of junk
in the recycling bin.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.027
But if my patient pulls through,

18:32.111 --> 18:33.862
I'll be able to restore the network

18:33.946 --> 18:36.406
without having to pay
the hackers a dime.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.075
Wow.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.368
-That's great.
-Yeah.

18:45.749 --> 18:49.044
The insurance guy came to an agreement
with the hackers, didn't he?

18:52.089 --> 18:54.091
Actually, he negotiated them down

18:54.174 --> 18:56.135
below the original ransom amount.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.348
I didn't authorize it yet.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.520
You have till 9:00 a.m.
to get us back online.

19:07.938 --> 19:08.856
[softly] Okay.

19:10.691 --> 19:11.900
[door closes]

19:13.235 --> 19:14.319
[monitor beeping]

19:14.403 --> 19:16.488
We will get one more chest CT,

19:16.572 --> 19:17.906
and then we will insert

19:17.990 --> 19:20.826
the central venous line
and the arterial line

19:20.909 --> 19:22.369
to finalize your surgical prep.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.538
-[machine beeps]
-[sighs]

19:24.621 --> 19:26.623
You must think I'm a sociopath, but…

19:26.707 --> 19:28.250
Don't even bother.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.669
It's not like I planned this all out.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.754
It just happened.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.882
You just forgot

19:34.965 --> 19:37.342
the drunk driving on a motorcycle detail

19:37.426 --> 19:40.262
while you raked in cash
and collected famous friends?

19:42.806 --> 19:44.308
I went back to school

19:45.017 --> 19:48.103
and got my MBA in nonprofit finance.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.774
My first interview after graduation

19:52.858 --> 19:55.277
was with this small cancer charity. And…

19:56.778 --> 19:58.614
for some reason,

19:59.448 --> 20:02.075
the woman assumed
I lost my leg to cancer.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.871
And I didn't correct her.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.750
It was a weak

20:10.375 --> 20:12.377
stupid moment.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.671
It wasn't just a moment.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.799
It was years.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.594
Where I was raising money,

20:20.677 --> 20:23.388
helping thousands of cancer survivors.

20:24.306 --> 20:27.392
And I knew if the truth came out,
that would all end.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.187
I have helped

20:31.188 --> 20:35.025
far more people over the last ten years
than I have hurt.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.449
You're scheduled for surgery
first thing in the morning.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.464
[footsteps approach]

20:58.173 --> 20:59.258
Hey, what's going on?

20:59.341 --> 21:00.259
Hey.

21:01.551 --> 21:04.054
Don't you have a thoracotomy to prep for?

21:04.137 --> 21:05.430
Yeah, I just

21:06.098 --> 21:07.182
needed a break.

21:10.143 --> 21:11.228
I'm fine.

21:12.604 --> 21:16.441
"I'm fine" is a pretty reliable indicator
that someone is not fine.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.740
[sighs]

35:02.809 --> 35:05.770
-…just saved the whole hospital…
-Will you shush for a second?

35:06.687 --> 35:07.939
Wait for the compliment.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.318
Thank you.

35:12.902 --> 35:13.986
Well done.

35:15.530 --> 35:17.657
You're welcome.

35:18.282 --> 35:21.327
If I ever have another poker night,
you're invited.

35:36.259 --> 35:40.096
You'll need to take all three of these
every morning and before bedtime.

35:44.058 --> 35:45.977
Call me if you need anything.

35:49.021 --> 35:50.106
Thank you

35:50.189 --> 35:52.108
for not giving up on me.

36:05.913 --> 36:07.915

36:07.999 --> 36:09.792
I've never been fired before,

36:09.876 --> 36:11.961
but I'm pretty sure that's how it works.

36:12.044 --> 36:13.087
I'll talk to Lim.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.922
Convince her to give you a second chance.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.299
I do not think she'll do that.

36:16.382 --> 36:17.800
She was willing to fire you,

36:17.884 --> 36:20.303
-and she likes you a lot more than her.
-Shaun…

36:21.262 --> 36:22.263
It's okay.

36:24.056 --> 36:26.684
I've enjoyed working with you both.

36:28.811 --> 36:29.896
Thank you.

36:33.524 --> 36:35.651
Um, if there is anything I can do,

36:35.735 --> 36:37.403
don't hesitate to call.

36:45.036 --> 36:45.953
I'll miss you.

36:46.996 --> 36:48.831
But I don't want to hug you.

36:52.126 --> 36:53.336
[chuckles]

37:00.801 --> 37:02.011
Surgery went well.

37:02.094 --> 37:04.513
You'll be back to competition
in a couple months.

37:10.019 --> 37:10.937
Was it you?

37:11.646 --> 37:12.730
Oh.

37:12.813 --> 37:15.149
I can't claim credit for that good deed.

37:16.108 --> 37:18.736
Not a terribly convincing denial.

37:18.819 --> 37:21.239
If I cared about convincing you,
I'd try harder.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.785
I knew this day would eventually come.

37:27.703 --> 37:32.041
And I expected I'd feel vulnerable,

37:32.124 --> 37:33.542
exposed.

37:33.876 --> 37:35.086
And I do.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.506
But I also didn't expect that,

37:38.589 --> 37:40.007
you know, I'd feel

37:40.675 --> 37:41.759
relieved.

37:43.219 --> 37:44.887
It's a little like

37:45.763 --> 37:48.015
getting back in the water the first time

37:49.183 --> 37:50.685
without my prosthetic.

37:51.602 --> 37:54.689
I had to awkwardly

37:54.772 --> 37:56.315
hop to the water,

37:56.399 --> 37:58.025

37:59.902 --> 38:01.529
But once I got in, I…

38:03.197 --> 38:04.573
