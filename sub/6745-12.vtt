my opening statement,

00:03.771 --> 00:06.372
let me read to you
from the signed confession

00:06.374 --> 00:08.540
the defendant gave
on the night of the murder

00:08.542 --> 00:09.775
10 months ago.

00:09.777 --> 00:13.312
He says,
"it was our third anniversary.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.414
We were going to dinner.

00:15.416 --> 00:18.751
Lisa had dropped off the baby
with her mom.

00:18.753 --> 00:22.354
I started celebrating early
and got drunk.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.390
Lisa argued with me.

00:24.392 --> 00:27.993
I don't remember why,
but I slapped her.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.962
She packed a bag to leave.

00:29.964 --> 00:34.433
I pushed her, and she fell
over the second-floor railing

00:34.435 --> 00:38.637
of our house and hit her head
on the tile below.

00:38.639 --> 00:41.507
I know I should've called
911 right away,

00:41.509 --> 00:45.077
but for some reason
I'll never understand,

00:45.079 --> 00:46.812
I went out to a bar.

00:46.814 --> 00:49.248
I don't remember which one.

00:49.250 --> 00:53.552
I didn't notice Lisa
on the floor when I came home,

00:53.554 --> 00:56.021
and I passed out on the sofa.

00:56.023 --> 00:59.391
The defendant has since
withdrawn his first confession,

00:59.393 --> 01:01.960
replacing it with a statement
insisting he simply

01:01.962 --> 01:04.930
can't recall what happened
the night his wife was murdered.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.299

Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

01:20.448 --> 01:24.950

And the night that she died...

01:26.987 --> 01:28.220
[ Sighs ]

01:28.222 --> 01:30.789
Well,
not my client's finest hour,

01:30.791 --> 01:34.693
for he failed to exhibit
the maturity one often

01:34.695 --> 01:37.329
associates with the words
"husband..."

01:38.699 --> 01:41.333
"...father."

01:41.335 --> 01:44.503
And after a drunken blackout,

01:44.505 --> 01:49.274
he even let the police fill in
his memory blanks for him.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.510
But I don't blame the police

01:51.512 --> 01:54.880
for focusing their
investigation on Mr. song.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.716
He certainly is no superhero.

01:57.718 --> 02:01.720
Which means,
in addition to falling short

02:01.722 --> 02:04.323
to the needs
of his wife and daughter,

02:04.325 --> 02:07.559
he also could not alter
the laws of physics,

02:07.561 --> 02:12.865
nor could he exceed the limits
of his molecular structure,

02:12.867 --> 02:15.534
because he's not a superhero.

02:15.536 --> 02:19.538
The defense intends to introduce

02:19.540 --> 02:22.174
scientifically-irrefutable
evidence

02:22.176 --> 02:25.244
that Mr. song
did not murder his wife.

02:25.246 --> 02:28.213
So, we won't ask for mercy.

02:28.215 --> 02:30.682
We won't ask for forgiveness.

02:30.684 --> 02:33.919

that he just this moment

02:49.870 --> 02:51.803
found evidence exonerating
his client,

02:51.805 --> 02:54.239

to be included in discovery.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.708

-Jack bluffs.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.912
Did Mr. song write out his
confession in his own hand?

02:59.914 --> 03:02.114
Yes, and when the police
showed up at his house,

03:02.116 --> 03:03.749
he was covered
in his wife's blood.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.083
It's a no-brainer.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.786
I offered manslaughter because
I was iffy on intent.

was just his address

and advice
from the 911 operator.

03:55.603 --> 03:58.704
So, I'm assuming
that detective bell tried

03:58.706 --> 04:02.441
to corroborate Mr. song's claim
that he'd been drinking.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.842
Of course.
We all did.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.744
But Mr. song couldn't remember
where he went.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.913
And detective bell
would've kept at it, too,

04:07.915 --> 04:10.315
but six days after the arrest,
he had a stroke.

04:10.317 --> 04:12.818
Besides,
it's always the husband.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.720
And we got
a great confession.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.089
So what could Jack raydor
possibly have

04:17.091 --> 04:18.590
that would
invalidate that?

04:18.592 --> 04:20.792
Something about

You know,
I would hate to be accused

04:31.005 --> 04:34.506
of reopening an investigation
because the defense attorney

04:34.508 --> 04:35.774
was my ex-husband.

09:39.846 --> 09:42.247
Please,
please track down the bar

09:42.249 --> 09:44.449
where Ken song was drinking,
and, rusty...

09:44.451 --> 09:48.486
Yeah?
Remember, don't ask slider
anything about mariana's murder.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.922
-I won't.
-Okay.

09:50.924 --> 09:54.693
Grove: If you were withholding
information from this court,

09:54.695 --> 09:56.361
that would be
a serious offense.

09:56.363 --> 09:59.364
The defense received
this new evidence only recently.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.967
I spent several days trying
to authenticate it.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.302
Your honor, in order to prove
this video's authenticity --

10:04.304 --> 10:06.671
I've watched it several times.
It's clearly the defendant.

10:06.673 --> 10:09.874
And he's also clearly someplace
else when the murder occurred,

10:09.876 --> 10:12.010
unless the time stamp's
erroneous.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.713
The LAPD is trying
to determine that, your honor.

10:14.715 --> 10:18.683
But if you can't say
the video's fake,

10:18.685 --> 10:20.285
how do you go forward,
Andrea?

10:20.287 --> 10:23.188
Question the time line that you
established with the fitbit?

10:23.190 --> 10:25.323
Your honor,
we've had less that 16 hours

10:25.325 --> 10:27.726
to properly evaluate
this new evidence.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.861
Excuse me,
but that's not true.

10:29.863 --> 10:33.098
The state has had months
to follow up on this

10:33.100 --> 10:37.068
using the d.A.'S investigative
division or the LAPD,

10:37.070 --> 10:40.405
the third largest police
department in the country.
Uh, uh, uh -- Mr. raydor,

10:40.407 --> 10:43.308
this may shock you,
but I'm fairly well-acquainted

10:43.310 --> 10:45.243
with the local law-enforcement
community, okay?

10:45.245 --> 10:47.579
Of course, your honor.
I'm sorry.
Make your point.

10:47.581 --> 10:50.081
Well, your honor,
the defense requires

10:50.083 --> 10:54.185
neither more time
nor more time lines.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.291
Okay.

11:00.293 --> 11:03.028
Andrea, the law here
is not on your side.

11:03.030 --> 11:06.398
I will allow the people a day
to disprove the video,

11:06.400 --> 11:08.133
and then we
have to pick up this trial

11:08.135 --> 11:12.370
where we left off, at, uh,
1:30 tomorrow afternoon.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.572
Yes.
Thank you, your honor.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.975
Thank you, judge.
Excuse me.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.784
Ultimately,
if Mr. song is innocent,

11:25.786 --> 11:27.952
this is a good thing.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.088
Beverly:
Yesterday morning,

11:30.090 --> 11:32.791
you told me
he was guilty as sin,

11:32.793 --> 11:34.292
that this was
an open-and-shut case,

11:34.294 --> 11:35.827
and the bastard
would spend

11:35.829 --> 11:37.796
the rest of his life in jail
for killing my girl.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.130
He confessed.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.466
He had my sister's blood
all over him.

11:41.468 --> 11:44.235
But we just received a video
that seems to suggest

11:44.237 --> 11:45.904
that Mr. song was
in a bar

11:45.906 --> 11:48.073
during the time
that Lisa was attacked.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.442
Ken was in a bar
every night of his life.

11:50.444 --> 11:52.777
Whatever video you have
proves nothing.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.479
Oh!
I can't believe this.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.947
You said trust you.

11:55.949 --> 11:59.784
Trust the system,
and now he's getting out.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.119
If the video is real,

12:01.121 --> 12:03.254
we would be convicting
the wrong person.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.690
My God, I --
does he get Mia, too?

12:05.692 --> 12:07.425
If he's found innocent,

12:07.427 --> 12:10.595
Mr. song would likely have his
parental rights restored.

12:10.597 --> 12:12.363
But, look, Mrs. lowe --

12:12.365 --> 12:14.933
no, I won't look.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.435
Not after all
we've been through.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.504
God.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.075
I don't get it.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.511
How could you have been
so wrong this whole time?

12:26.513 --> 12:29.647
Provenza: We have
our heads in the cloud,

12:29.649 --> 12:32.317

apparently is a place

12:32.319 --> 12:34.519
that computer stuff
hangs out together.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.955
Every document, picture,
piece of music in the could

12:36.957 --> 12:39.190
has its own unique
digital signature,

12:39.192 --> 12:40.692
rather like a strand
of DNA.

12:40.694 --> 12:43.161
Now, to see if someone fussed
with the video's --

12:43.163 --> 12:45.263
Mike, what she wants to know is

12:45.265 --> 12:48.666
could anyone have altered
this time stamp?

12:48.668 --> 12:51.035
Doesn't look
like it yet.

12:51.037 --> 12:54.639
Okay, it would be very helpful
if we knew the name of the bar.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.107
Flynn: Well,
we're closing in on it.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.709
Buzz: In starting this video,
we've come across

12:57.711 --> 13:00.545
several clues we're using
to help focus our search.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.914
If you look at this guy
in the background right here,

13:02.916 --> 13:05.316
you can see him adjusting
a mic on the stage.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.353
And under the mic looks like
a karaoke machine,

13:08.355 --> 13:10.155
though that doesn't narrow
the field all that much.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.757
Hey, buzz, can you, uh, zip
ahead a few seconds, please?

13:12.759 --> 13:14.626
Sure.

13:14.628 --> 13:17.328
Okay, stop right there. Thanks.
All right, you see that?

13:17.330 --> 13:21.232
This place was hosting a
storms vs. Reina viewing party,

13:21.234 --> 13:22.567
which required a license fee.

13:22.569 --> 13:25.003
What are these
little note pads right here?

13:25.005 --> 13:27.105
Buzz, can you
hit play again?

13:29.276 --> 13:32.477
Right there.
Oh, those note pads are
for trivia tournaments.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.946
It's a thing now.
Flynn: All right,
all we have to do now

13:34.948 --> 13:37.081
is find the bar
that licensed the fight,

13:37.083 --> 13:39.617

in there by mistake.

that night specifically.

Hobbs: Hate to say it,

15:03.069 --> 15:06.037
but maybe
I'm prosecuting the wrong guy.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.973
What if Mr. song documented
his time at the bar

15:08.975 --> 15:10.875
so someone else
could do the murder?

15:10.877 --> 15:13.878
The video conveniently shows up
at trial

15:13.880 --> 15:15.446
after jeopardy's attached.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.748
He's found innocent,

15:16.750 --> 15:20.251
and he can never be tried
for his wife's murder again.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.621
But then,
if that was his plan,

15:23.623 --> 15:27.892
why did he confess to this crime
to begin with?

15:27.894 --> 15:30.295
Flynn had to run
to the doctor.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.497
-Why? What's wrong?
-Nothing.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.592

It was gross. She got upset
and left for some reason.

18:55.435 --> 18:56.601
I thought
your mother was a cop.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.903
Yeah, my adopted mother
is a cop.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.905
My biological mother is...

19:00.907 --> 19:06.010
Is an addict with a great
disappearing act.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.578
Oh.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.647
Is that how you ended up
on the street?

19:09.649 --> 19:11.149
When you said you lived
on the street?

19:11.151 --> 19:12.884
Your mother put you there,
is that it?

19:12.886 --> 19:14.552
Yeah, basically.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.654
Anyway, when she was
where you are,

19:16.656 --> 19:18.489
she said that anything
that interrupted

19:18.491 --> 19:20.324
her daily routine here
was worthwhile.

19:20.326 --> 19:23.127
Well, guess what, man?
I'm not your mother.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.796
I did not kill this Alice,
mariana --

19:25.798 --> 19:28.232
whatever her name was.
Slider, I am not allowed
to talk with you about that.

19:28.234 --> 19:30.067
What I was hoping
to speak with you about --

19:30.069 --> 19:31.636
weren't you brought up
an American?

19:31.638 --> 19:34.438
I mean, don't you believe in
innocent until proven guilty?

19:34.440 --> 19:36.474
My lawyer says
I'm guaranteed that --

19:36.476 --> 19:39.076
innocent
until proven guilty.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.945
Hobbs: We are way beyond

19:40.947 --> 19:42.880
the "shadow of a doubt"
part of this conversation.

19:42.882 --> 19:46.017
If you withheld crucial evidence
for 10 months, Jack...

19:46.019 --> 19:48.452
Taylor: That's not only
an ethical breach, Jack,

19:48.454 --> 19:51.255
but maybe an act
of criminal conspiracy.

19:51.257 --> 19:53.724
Do you all want
to be bad losers?

19:53.726 --> 19:56.327
Folding your hands,
blaming your cards?

19:56.329 --> 19:58.963
Or you want to hear
what happened?
Sharon:
Oh, you're gonna explain.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.665
This should be
fascinating.

20:00.667 --> 20:04.268
If you notice,
on the flyers we circulated,

20:04.270 --> 20:07.305
respondents were asked
to type in the subject line

20:07.307 --> 20:10.208
of their e-mails
the name Ken song.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.143
Instead, the girl
who sent the evidence

20:12.145 --> 20:14.979
typed in
"video of my birthday"

20:14.981 --> 20:18.282
from what appeared to be
a spam e-mail address.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.951
This went directly

20:19.953 --> 20:22.320
to my top-notch investigator's
junk file.

20:22.322 --> 20:27.458
Uh, I --
do you actually think anyone
would believe this?

20:27.460 --> 20:29.327
I don't care
what you believe.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.696
As the trial approached,
I asked the investigator

20:31.698 --> 20:35.366
to put together all
of the e-mails he had received,

20:35.368 --> 20:37.034
and voilà.

20:37.036 --> 20:41.472
So, you saw this video,
what, two days ago?

20:41.474 --> 20:43.474
Possibly two weeks.

20:43.476 --> 20:46.978
You sat on evidence
after your client confessed.

20:46.980 --> 20:50.147
But I couldn't place the bar
in which it was shot.

20:50.149 --> 20:54.018
Oh, and by the way, thank you
for providing a witness

20:54.020 --> 20:56.654
that was actually there
and remembers so much.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.789
It should come in handy
down the road.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.726
Because it strengthens
a civil suit

21:01.728 --> 21:04.996
your client can file
when his case is dismissed?

21:04.998 --> 21:09.267
That's why you held onto this
evidence for so many months?

21:09.269 --> 21:11.569
Naturally,
Mr. song should be compensated

21:11.571 --> 21:13.437
for his
wrongful imprisonment.

21:13.439 --> 21:16.674
Oh, that witness
that you're so happy about

21:16.676 --> 21:19.644
also remembers Ken
making out with a woman

21:19.646 --> 21:21.812
who left the bar
shortly before the murder.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.981
Well, make sure you tell
that to the judge

21:23.983 --> 21:27.652
so I can have it ruled
prejudicial and inadmissible.

21:27.654 --> 21:30.955
You can say what you want,
but you turned down a deal
for manslaughter,

21:30.957 --> 21:33.724
which means
you'd seen that video.

21:33.726 --> 21:38.763
Jack raydor, we could've
released Ken song last march,

21:38.765 --> 21:42.566
and you kept an innocent man
locked up in jail.

21:42.568 --> 21:43.834
There's the nagging voice

21:43.836 --> 21:46.370
of someone else's
conscience again.

21:46.372 --> 21:49.040
Well, here's the truth.

21:49.042 --> 21:51.509
Like it or not,

21:51.511 --> 21:54.745
if all of you had done
as good a job as I had on this,

21:54.747 --> 21:57.548
we wouldn't be here
working through

21:57.550 --> 22:01.185
all this little
<i> contretemps.</i>

22:01.187 --> 22:03.087
Would we?

22:03.089 --> 22:05.890
I'll see myself out.

¶¶

22:10.997 --> 22:12.330

22:12.332 --> 22:13.831
The worst part is,

22:13.833 --> 22:18.569
his explanation
of the evidence works, legally.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.871
And even if it didn't,
the video is still admissible.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.873
-Sharon?
-Hm?

22:22.875 --> 22:24.075
Any thoughts?

22:24.077 --> 22:25.376
Just one, really.

22:25.378 --> 22:28.312
If Ken song didn't murder
his wife...

22:28.314 --> 22:30.081
Who did?

22:30.083 --> 22:32.183
Sykes: Captain,
this name popped out at me.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.018
We were looking
through all the bar receipts,

22:34.020 --> 22:36.287
and guess who else was there
the night of the murder?

22:36.289 --> 22:38.222
Mary lowe.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.423
The victim's sister.

22:39.425 --> 22:42.693
I know.
I saw her in court.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.496
She was at buttersweets
at 7:05 P.M.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.931
Are we sure it was her?

22:46.933 --> 22:49.500
Well, I ran that picture
by ainsley, our birthday girl,

22:49.502 --> 22:50.868
in a six pack,
and she I.D.'D Mary

22:50.870 --> 22:53.537
as the woman that was making out
with Ken song.

22:53.539 --> 22:54.872
If she left the bar
after signing this receipt,

22:54.874 --> 22:57.808
she could have easily driven
to Lisa's house.

22:57.810 --> 23:01.011
And if Mary was in love
with her sister's husband,

23:01.013 --> 23:02.947
well, that's motive.

23:02.949 --> 23:05.649
Okay, let's invite Mary
for a visit

23:05.651 --> 23:08.819
and see if she's up to something
worse than adultery.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.087
Thank you.

23:13.993 --> 23:17.661
The doctor said, since I had
that little dustup with the car,

23:17.663 --> 23:21.532
um, let me see, uh, what --
some kind of lining

23:21.534 --> 23:23.401
got stretched or snapped --
who knows?

23:23.403 --> 23:25.870
Anyway, resulting
in a bit of coag--

23:25.872 --> 23:28.239
coagulation?

23:28.241 --> 23:29.774
Andy,
you have a blood clot?

23:29.776 --> 23:31.876
Uh, little one --
very small.

23:31.878 --> 23:34.445
They gave me some meds
to break it down,

23:34.447 --> 23:36.347
but if that doesn't work,
I have to get surgery.

23:36.349 --> 23:38.482
Surgery?
What kind of surgery?
Very common.

23:38.484 --> 23:40.851
You know, they open up
my artery and just take

23:40.853 --> 23:43.187
that little sucker
right out of my neck.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.989
In your carotid artery?

23:45.825 --> 23:47.591
That's where
the blood clot is?

23:47.593 --> 23:50.728
Uh, listen, before we
go any further, um...

23:50.730 --> 23:54.198
First,
I had to report to provenza

23:54.200 --> 23:55.599
as my immediate supervisor,

23:55.601 --> 23:58.602
and then to you
as my commanding officer,

23:58.604 --> 24:01.505
uh, that I need clearance
from my physician

24:01.507 --> 24:04.208
before I return to work.
That's not a problem.

24:04.210 --> 24:08.212
And since the doctor says I need
to be monitored 24/7,

24:08.214 --> 24:10.714
provenza spoke with patrice
who, if you remember,

24:10.716 --> 24:13.250
used to be a professional nurse,
and -- and she's agreed

24:13.252 --> 24:16.620
to hang with me when you and
the kid aren't at your condo --

24:16.622 --> 24:20.157
I mean, if I can stay there
until the clot goes away.
Of course.

24:20.159 --> 24:23.093
Oh, uh, [Stammers]
There's just one more thing.

24:23.095 --> 24:26.230
Um, can we just keep
this whole thing about

24:26.232 --> 24:28.999
my blood-clot situation
between you and me?

24:29.001 --> 24:31.669
And -- you know, and provenza?
I mean, you can tell your kids.

24:31.671 --> 24:34.705
I don't want them to think
that I'm moving in or something.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.240
Otherwise...
[ Chuckles ]

24:36.242 --> 24:39.109
Okay.
I'll keep it very quiet.

24:39.111 --> 24:42.980
And, um,
Emily and Ricky and rusty

24:42.982 --> 24:45.583

understand.

24:45.585 --> 24:46.784
Uh, yeah.

24:46.786 --> 24:49.420
Um...I'm still healing.

24:49.422 --> 24:50.821
-I'm sorry.
-So no hugs.

24:50.823 --> 24:54.959
Also, there's no running,
no reaching above my head,

24:54.961 --> 24:57.161
no crossing my legs
for some reason.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.762

All right,
no bending over, and no driving.

25:03.269 --> 25:07.071
So I'll need a ride home,
uh, I mean to your condo.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.806
Hobbs:
So, on the list you gave me

25:08.808 --> 25:11.175
of your movements
on last January 22nd,

25:11.177 --> 25:13.410
you just forgot
to mention you had drinks

25:13.412 --> 25:16.313
with your sisters murderer
right before he killed her?

25:16.315 --> 25:18.716
Because to me,
that sounds like you were trying

25:18.718 --> 25:21.285
to have the justice system
off the guy.

25:21.287 --> 25:25.823
No, no, no, I -- I was trying
to calm Ken down.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.992
He and Lisa got
into a terrible fight.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.561
<i> He was afraid that she was</i>
<i> going to leave him</i>

25:30.563 --> 25:31.762
<i> and take the baby.</i>

25:31.764 --> 25:33.497
<i> She wouldn't have.</i>

25:33.499 --> 25:35.266
<i> She loved him too much.</i>

25:35.268 --> 25:38.536
But Ken called me to meet,
and I felt --

25:38.538 --> 25:40.437
you felt what?

25:40.439 --> 25:42.840
Look.

25:42.842 --> 25:46.076
I already told you,
he needed reassurance.

25:46.078 --> 25:49.146
Lisa loved Ken, but she could be
mean to him sometimes.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.981
Was that because
of Ken's drinking,

25:50.983 --> 25:53.684
or because
he was screwing her sister?

25:54.854 --> 25:58.088
<i> Oh, I think</i>
<i> we touched a nerve.</i>

25:58.090 --> 26:01.058
<i> And that's my cue</i>
<i> to leave.</i>
<i> Why?</i>

26:01.060 --> 26:03.294
Because, Mary, you're not
just a witness anymore.

the questions,

neatly on a piece of paper

against the glass

his tongue down her throat

29:46.519 --> 29:47.918
Before 7:30.

that he and Lisa were supposed
to leave for their reservation.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.225

he'd be right behind me.

lied to me.

38:58.503 --> 39:01.805
I never saw any of this shit
before in my life.

39:01.807 --> 39:03.206
I see.

39:03.208 --> 39:06.643
Well, would you mind just
answering the third question?

39:06.645 --> 39:09.946
Just at the --
near the top of the page, there?

39:09.948 --> 39:11.815
Yeah.
Yeah, I mind.

39:11.817 --> 39:14.651
Okay, well...

39:14.653 --> 39:18.121
Well, could you just read
the third question for me?

39:18.123 --> 39:20.757
Out loud?

39:20.759 --> 39:23.226
Or the second question.

39:23.228 --> 39:25.328
Again, you don't --
you don't have to answer it.

39:25.330 --> 39:27.130
Just read it to me.

39:29.634 --> 39:32.035
Does it not make sense
to you?

39:37.042 --> 39:39.442
Is it that you don't want
to read it...

39:41.313 --> 39:43.279
...or you don't know how?

39:43.281 --> 39:47.150

[ sighs ]

39:49.888 --> 39:52.255
Jack:
What is taking so long?

39:52.257 --> 39:54.424
You've already
questioned Ken.

39:54.426 --> 39:56.292
His whole family
is desperate to see him.

39:56.294 --> 39:59.462
Enough!
-Here they come, Jack.

39:59.464 --> 40:02.031
Oh, Ken, thank God.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.266
I told you we'd win.

40:03.268 --> 40:05.735
And we're gonna win again,
and this time we're gonna --

40:05.737 --> 40:09.139
you're fired.
You let me think I killed Lisa.

40:09.141 --> 40:10.807
You let me rot in jail.

40:10.809 --> 40:16.045
Oh, n-no, no, I -- what --
what I did was I-I ran out

40:16.047 --> 40:18.181
the clock so they
couldn't prosecute you again.

40:18.183 --> 40:20.150
You were hoping
to collect a percentage

40:20.152 --> 40:22.352
of my damages
for wrongful imprisonment.

40:22.354 --> 40:24.087
Well, I'm finding
a new attorney.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.423
And you'll be one
of the people I'm suing.

40:26.425 --> 40:28.691
Ahh...

40:30.195 --> 40:33.430
Ooh.
What ingratitude.

40:33.432 --> 40:36.266
Save a guy from life
in prison...

40:36.268 --> 40:38.001
And he turns on you.

40:38.003 --> 40:40.470
Well,
don't give up hope, Jack.

40:40.472 --> 40:44.240
Maybe when you learn to do
your job as well as we do ours,

40:44.242 --> 40:46.843
these things might stop
happening to you.

40:46.845 --> 40:50.547
[ Sighs ]
I gloated too early.

40:51.917 --> 40:54.384
I see that.

40:54.386 --> 40:56.419
Oh, well.

40:56.421 --> 40:59.255
Have your little laugh.

40:59.257 --> 41:04.794
Oh, and may I say,<i> quel dommage.</i>

41:04.796 --> 41:08.798
<i> Quel dommage</i> about Andy Flynn.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.900
Maybe his present health crisis

41:10.902 --> 41:13.536
is not as bad as Emily
made it sound,

41:13.538 --> 41:17.240
but I still think that we should
all pray for his total recovery.

41:18.743 --> 41:22.078
See ya,<i> mes amis.</i>

41:22.080 --> 41:24.280
[ Door opens ]

41:24.282 --> 41:26.749
Well, what's wrong
with lieutenant Flynn?

41:26.751 --> 41:29.652
That's
an excellent question.

41:29.654 --> 41:32.255
Where is he, anyway?
