WEBVTT

00:02.654 --> 00:03.655
Previously onDynasty...Heidi?

00:03.699 --> 00:04.874
"I'm sorry, but it's your turn

00:04.917 --> 00:06.180
to be the parent now."

00:06.223 --> 00:08.356
ADAM:
I poisoned Jeff Colby,

00:08.399 --> 00:10.880
and I did so at the request
of my father.

00:10.923 --> 00:13.013
JENNINGS:
The fire department cleaned up
and left the scene.

00:13.056 --> 00:14.666
It's being reported
as an accident.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.581
They won't find anything
that can lead them back to us.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.061
VANESSA:
After all of that crap

00:18.105 --> 00:20.107
about how you thought of me
as your own child,

00:20.150 --> 00:22.022
you go and screw my boyfriend?!

00:22.065 --> 00:23.371
With all that publicity,

00:23.414 --> 00:27.114
I was able to sell House of Deveraux.

00:33.337 --> 00:35.296
Good morning.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.080
It was.Vanessa, come on.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.082
You can't avoid me forever.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.257
It's a big house.

00:40.301 --> 00:41.737
I know I made a mistake.

00:43.826 --> 00:46.829
Calling someone the wrong name
is a mistake.

00:46.872 --> 00:48.744
You slept withmy boyfriend.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.920
You taped it, and
you released it.

00:50.963 --> 00:53.096
I told you, we were drunk.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.837
It was bad judgment.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.752
And I don't even knowhow it got out.

00:56.795 --> 00:58.101
I must have been hacked.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.972
Why would I believe anything
that you say?

01:00.016 --> 01:02.149
After everything
I've done for you?

01:02.192 --> 01:03.802
I got you a record deal,

01:03.846 --> 01:06.153
this roof over your head,
that croissant.

01:06.196 --> 01:08.068
Oh, you want this back?

01:08.111 --> 01:09.504
Here, take it!

01:10.983 --> 01:12.724
BLAKE:
What the hell's
going on here?

01:12.768 --> 01:14.726
WOMAN:
Cut! Can we
take that again?

01:14.770 --> 01:16.815
Just fromthe croissant throw.

01:16.859 --> 01:18.078
Who are you?

01:18.121 --> 01:20.471
This is Abby,
one of the producers of this

01:20.515 --> 01:22.386
documentary project of ours.

01:22.430 --> 01:23.735
We're calling it

01:23.779 --> 01:25.085
House of Deveraux.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.782
What do you think?

01:26.825 --> 01:30.481
I think this is the house
of me, not some movie set.

01:30.525 --> 01:34.094
And I don't want any of
this anywhere near me.

01:37.184 --> 01:39.055
You're in my chair.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.145
Why don't we pick this up later?

01:42.189 --> 01:44.191
Sure.

01:50.197 --> 01:52.155
Sweetheart?

01:52.199 --> 01:53.852
Have you spoken to Michael?

01:53.896 --> 01:55.115
Not since the party.Wait.

01:55.158 --> 01:57.465
Vanessa...

01:57.508 --> 02:00.032
House of Deveraux
is your story.

02:00.076 --> 02:02.513
And that story started
before that tape,

02:02.557 --> 02:04.167
and Michael was a part of it.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.691
The world needs to know that
you had a good relationship.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.693
What do you want me to do?

02:08.737 --> 02:10.695
Reenact my life
before you ruined it?

02:10.739 --> 02:12.697
Pretend that me and
Michael are still together,

02:12.741 --> 02:14.569
that I don't know
you slept with him?

02:14.612 --> 02:16.875
That's my girl.
I knew you'd get it.

02:19.226 --> 02:22.142
And it's only been a day.How far could Heidi have gotten?

02:22.185 --> 02:23.708
Well, I talked
to the detective,

02:23.752 --> 02:26.189
and she hasn't
turned in her rental car.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.104
Which I'm hoping means
she didn't get on a plane.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.193
Or the car is sitting
in some airport parking lot,

02:30.237 --> 02:32.195
and Heidi is on a beach
in Capri.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.936
That lucky bitch.

02:33.979 --> 02:35.155
Well, I hope not.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.939
There's only so long
Connor will believe

02:36.982 --> 02:38.593
his mom's on another
job interview.

02:38.636 --> 02:41.335
Liam?

02:41.378 --> 02:42.771
Can I have some
chicken fingers?

02:42.814 --> 02:45.121
Didn't you just havescrambled eggs

02:45.165 --> 02:47.384
and-and yogurt and,

02:47.428 --> 02:49.778
like, three of the sugar packetsfrom my coffee?

02:49.821 --> 02:50.996
Chicken fingers.

02:51.040 --> 02:51.910
Coming right up, okay?

02:51.954 --> 02:53.825
Do you thinkhe has a tapeworm?

02:53.869 --> 02:57.177
Can you call room service?
Got to go check in with my guy.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.179
Okay, but if your guydoesn't find anything,

02:59.222 --> 03:01.181
we are gonna need a lot morethan room service.

03:01.224 --> 03:03.618
Like a nannyand a really good shrink.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.054
Oh.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.925
Kids are pretty resilient.

03:07.970 --> 03:10.059
The shrink was for me.

03:16.108 --> 03:17.197
Uh-uh.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.270
WOMAN :
Dr. Sherman to 324.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.403
Dr. Sherman to 324.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.755
Mm-hmm.

04:02.372 --> 04:03.504
Mm-hmm.

04:40.497 --> 04:43.413
Oh, passionfruit.
My favorite.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.415
Here, let me
pour you some coffee.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.112
Uh, no, thanks.

04:47.156 --> 04:48.113
I'm having tea this morning.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.332
What kind of tea?

04:49.376 --> 04:51.116
It's an herbal blend.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.857
Would you pass me
the salt, please?Sure.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.772
There you go.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.906
What's this for?

04:57.949 --> 04:59.081
You just asked for it.

04:59.124 --> 05:01.301
No, I asked for
sugar for my tea?

05:02.345 --> 05:04.434
Of course.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.480
My mistake.

05:08.046 --> 05:09.874
How do you feel?

05:09.918 --> 05:12.399
Mm, uh, great,
actually. Uh...

05:12.442 --> 05:15.010
You know, Blake buying
that pharma company

05:15.053 --> 05:16.664
might have been a
blessing in disguise.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.970
I don't see how that's possible.

05:19.014 --> 05:21.712
They were at least a decade awayfrom any sort of treatment.

05:21.756 --> 05:24.715
I don't have ten years to wait,
so what was I really chasing?

05:24.759 --> 05:27.283
Let Blake have it.And what are you gonna do?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.372
Well, I'm doing it.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.809
Nature's pharmacy.

05:31.853 --> 05:35.073
I've been reading up online, andmy acupuncturist hooked me up

05:35.117 --> 05:37.772
with this amazing doctor who
specializes in all this stuff.

05:37.815 --> 05:41.253
Hey, I am all forthe holistic approach,

05:41.297 --> 05:43.125
but Western medicine...

05:43.168 --> 05:44.735
I'm feeling good, Alexis.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.650
Better than I have
in a long time.

05:46.694 --> 05:48.826
I thought you'd
be happy for me.Of course.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.741
I... I am.

05:50.785 --> 05:53.396
Good.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.398
MICHAEL:
I understand your concern,

05:55.442 --> 05:58.401
but that tape was made
without my consent

05:58.445 --> 06:00.403
and has nothing to do
with the Atlantix.

06:00.447 --> 06:01.926
Now, I can assure you,

06:01.970 --> 06:04.929
this is stilla family-friendly organization.

06:04.973 --> 06:06.366
Well, y...

06:06.409 --> 06:08.803
I-I hope that you'll reconsider.

06:10.413 --> 06:11.762
Of course.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.373
They won't reconsider.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.463
That's the eighth sponsor
that we've lost.

06:16.506 --> 06:19.379
And there's three moreon hold, but...

06:19.422 --> 06:21.381
you have a visitor.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.821
Vanessa.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.301
I didn't expect
to see you here,

06:29.345 --> 06:31.129
at least not without a weapon.

06:31.173 --> 06:32.304
Oh, I considered it.

06:32.348 --> 06:36.004
I wanted to scream at you,maybe punch you,

06:36.047 --> 06:38.398
until I realized it wouldn'tchange anything that happened.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.443
What's done is done, and...

06:40.487 --> 06:44.404
I just want to move forward.Well, that's incredibly
mature of you.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.188
Well, don't look so surprised.

06:46.231 --> 06:49.278
Look, I don't wantthat tape to define me.

06:49.321 --> 06:52.586
And right now, I have a chance
to tell the rest of my story.

06:52.629 --> 06:56.154
And, like it or not,
you're a part of it.

06:56.198 --> 06:59.331
So, I was hopingthat you could help me?

06:59.375 --> 07:00.768
Well, of course.

07:00.811 --> 07:02.770
I mean, anything I can do.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.772
So, we're actuallyshooting something.

07:04.815 --> 07:07.035
It's kind of a documentary
about my music.

07:07.078 --> 07:09.951
We have a producer,
a camera crew, all of that.

07:09.994 --> 07:12.170
We? You mean Dominique?

07:12.214 --> 07:13.476
She helped put it together.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.783
Why am I not surprised?

07:15.826 --> 07:18.742
Vanessa,
you do not need Dominique

07:18.786 --> 07:20.701
pushing you
into some reality show.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.485
You are smart.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.139
You're talented.

07:24.182 --> 07:26.315
Do you know
how many smart and talented

07:26.358 --> 07:29.231
singer-songwriters there are,
just in Atlanta?

07:29.274 --> 07:30.493
Most of themnever make it,

07:30.537 --> 07:32.060
and I don't want to be
a bartender forever.

07:32.103 --> 07:34.932
Look, I know thatDominique made that tape,

07:34.976 --> 07:37.108
but she didn'tmake it alone.

07:37.152 --> 07:40.198
And you saidyou wanted to make things right.

07:40.982 --> 07:43.375
Of course she didn't.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.421
And of course I do.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.989
I'm not asking you
to be some reality star

07:48.032 --> 07:50.121
or for us to get back together.

07:50.165 --> 07:51.993
I'm just asking for one day

07:52.036 --> 07:53.951
to pretend
like the tape never happened.

07:53.995 --> 07:55.823
It's the least you could do.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.522
ADAM:
So then he goes, "Well,

07:59.566 --> 08:01.132
at leastI don't have cancer."

08:03.395 --> 08:05.006
I appreciatethe warm welcome.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.095
It's really good to bepracticing medicine again.

08:07.138 --> 08:09.576
Um, speaking of which,I should get back to work.

08:09.619 --> 08:11.752
I'll see you soon.Thanks.

08:13.144 --> 08:16.017
Don't you look handsome
in your white coat.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.584
Mother,what are you doing here?

08:17.627 --> 08:19.281
I didn't know who
else to talk to.

08:19.324 --> 08:21.370
I think Jeff is
getting worse.

08:21.413 --> 08:23.590
This morning at breakfast,
he asked for the salt

08:23.633 --> 08:25.635
instead of the sugar
and didn't even realize it.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.071
Doctor.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.943
It's aphasia. Is it
the first time it's happened?

08:28.986 --> 08:30.379
Well, that I've noticed.

08:30.422 --> 08:32.729
But he's been taking all
these weird herbs and teas.

08:32.773 --> 08:35.123
What kind of herbs?I just told you-- weird.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.081
Well...And they're clearly
not helping.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.692
I don't know what
Blake's new drug company

08:38.735 --> 08:40.302
has been working on,
but whatever it is,

08:40.345 --> 08:41.869
it's got to be
better than this.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.348
Okay, what do you want me to do?

08:43.392 --> 08:46.700
Jeff needs a real doctor,
which you are... sort of.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.310
And I don't need
to remind you

08:48.353 --> 08:50.442
that if anything happens to him,the blood is on your hands.

08:50.486 --> 08:52.096
Okay, okay, let's notget too dramatic,

08:52.140 --> 08:54.969
and can you pleasekeep your voice down?Adam, you con...

08:57.058 --> 09:01.192
You confessed to poisoning
him, Adam, on video.

09:01.236 --> 09:04.195
If that gets released,
you will go to jail.

09:04.239 --> 09:06.981
And you'll be left in the cold.Exactly.

09:07.024 --> 09:10.245
We need to get Jeff
better, Dr. Carrington,

09:10.288 --> 09:12.508
or we're all gonna
pay the price.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.602
LIAM:
Hey, I got something.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.212
Me, too. I think it's an ulcer.

09:21.256 --> 09:25.042
Heidi's debit card was used at
a gas station in Montgomery.

09:25.086 --> 09:26.914
What? Alabama?

09:26.957 --> 09:28.132
The investigator's
trying to get there

09:28.176 --> 09:29.612
to see the security footage.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.745
Now, if it was Heidi, she
couldn't have gotten far.

09:31.788 --> 09:32.963
It'll only take
three hours

09:33.007 --> 09:34.225
if I leave first thing
tomorrow morning.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.749
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.794
I mean, can't he just, you know,like, bring her back here?

09:37.838 --> 09:39.100
Why do we have to go to Alabama?

09:39.143 --> 09:41.319
To find her.
But, obviously, I...

09:41.363 --> 09:43.887
I can't bring Connor to
look for his runaway mom.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.236
So what are you gonnado with him?

09:45.280 --> 09:46.455
I thought you could
stay here with him.

09:46.498 --> 09:47.761
It won't be more
than a day.

09:47.804 --> 09:50.198
By myself?Have you seen me with that kid?

09:50.241 --> 09:52.200
I mean, what if he asks me
where you are?

09:52.243 --> 09:54.115
I'll tell him I have to work.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.945
Fine. Okay, okay.

09:57.988 --> 09:59.511
Just please be back before 8:00,

09:59.555 --> 10:01.209
because Vanessa's single
comes out tomorrow,

10:01.252 --> 10:03.820
and I'm supposed to go
to the release party.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.605
You're a hero.Okay.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.650
No, no, not on the algae.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.248
Mmm. Wow.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.511
Well, good morning to you, too.

10:42.554 --> 10:46.080
Mm. I like to check
my cardio off early.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.952
Does that mean we get to stayin bed the rest of the day?

10:48.996 --> 10:49.953
Mm.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.563
I wish.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.304
I should really get moving.

10:53.348 --> 10:55.002
I still have to pack.

10:55.045 --> 10:56.699
Pack? For what?

10:56.743 --> 10:58.701
Mexico.

11:00.355 --> 11:03.314
My friend Adriana's
bridal shower tomorrow?

11:03.358 --> 11:04.751
I told you
weeks ago.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.927
You said to use the plane.

11:06.970 --> 11:09.886
Oh. Well, it musthave slipped my mind.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.933
Well, lucky for you,
it's ladies only.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.151
So...

11:14.195 --> 11:15.283
you're off the hook.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.764
I don't know.
It sounds like fun.

11:17.807 --> 11:19.635
Braiding each other's hair,

11:19.679 --> 11:21.289
lingerie pillow fights.

11:21.332 --> 11:24.031
Uh, you're thinking
of a sleepover,

11:24.074 --> 11:25.293
not a bridal shower.

11:25.336 --> 11:28.165
And you've clearly
never been to either.

11:28.209 --> 11:31.429
It's mostly just board
games and junk food.

11:31.473 --> 11:32.953
But then you have pillow fights?

11:32.996 --> 11:34.215
Very funny.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.004
VANESSA:
Coffee, babe?

11:41.048 --> 11:43.180
Uh, yes, please.

11:43.224 --> 11:44.834
And pancakes are done.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.749
Ooh, you are the best.

11:46.793 --> 11:50.100
Aw. You guys areso sweet together.

11:50.144 --> 11:53.800
It's actually hard being aroundsuch a happy couple, while I,

11:53.843 --> 11:56.890
a single, wealthy hotel owner,
am back on the market

11:56.933 --> 11:58.413
and ready for a good time.

11:58.456 --> 11:59.544
Speaking of which,

11:59.588 --> 12:01.503
we should move this partyto La Mirage.

12:01.546 --> 12:03.070
FALLON:Oh, God.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.899
Please don't tell me this issome kind of sex tape sequel.

12:05.942 --> 12:06.943
Cut.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.684
Oh, oh. Is it...is it a music video?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.425
For the single?Because I have some thoughts.

12:10.468 --> 12:11.382
Uh, it's a series,actually.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.297
About my lifeand music.

12:13.341 --> 12:16.953
And Dominique. She's trying
to be the next Kris Jenner.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.346
I guess Vanessa's Kim

12:18.389 --> 12:21.088
but with kind ofa Kylie twist.

12:21.131 --> 12:23.003
So that makes Culhane...

12:23.046 --> 12:24.178
Kanye?

12:24.221 --> 12:25.919
No, more of a Travis Scott.

12:25.962 --> 12:28.530
What about the S-E-X T-A-P-E?

12:28.573 --> 12:30.140
CONNOR:Mm.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.228
I can spell.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.752
And I'm hungry.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.492
Where's Liam?

12:34.536 --> 12:35.537
Working.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.192
Okay.Hey.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.324
You eat pancakes,don't you?

12:40.368 --> 12:42.370
With syrup?Sure.

12:44.198 --> 12:45.286
Look at that.

12:45.329 --> 12:46.374
Yum, yum, yum.

12:48.332 --> 12:49.856
Ew.

12:49.899 --> 12:52.380
What?This syrup tastes weird.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.512
I want the kind my mom buys.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.471
Oh, you meanthe high-fructose corn syrup

12:56.514 --> 12:57.864
that comes outof a plastic bottle?

12:57.907 --> 13:01.606
No, this comes fromthe finest trees in Vermont.

13:01.650 --> 13:04.218
I can takethe top one off, all right?

13:04.261 --> 13:05.480
You can eatthe ones underneath.

13:05.523 --> 13:06.829
It got on all of them.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.135
Really?

13:08.178 --> 13:09.397
Fine. I see your point.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.138
Look, let's forgetabout the pancakes.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.661
Why don't we go watch a movie.

13:12.704 --> 13:13.880
I'm still hungry.

13:13.923 --> 13:15.490
Okay. Well, we'll make
popcorn, all right?

13:15.533 --> 13:16.839
I mean,
I'm not gonna make popcorn,

13:16.883 --> 13:18.058
but maybe someone will.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.557
Ready when you are.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.298
PILOT:We're just waiting for one more.

13:41.342 --> 13:42.299
What?

13:42.343 --> 13:43.300
Who?

13:43.344 --> 13:45.433
I didn't invite anyone.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.001
Blake. Uh...

13:48.044 --> 13:49.219
What are you doing here?

13:49.263 --> 13:50.655
BLAKE:Surprise.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.788
Look, I know the shower'sjust for you and your girls,

13:52.832 --> 13:54.921
but I thought we could continuethe pillow fight after

13:54.964 --> 13:57.097
in a beachfront villasomewhere.

13:57.140 --> 13:59.708
I told Anders to hold my calls.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.492
Beto? What-what's hedoing here?

14:01.536 --> 14:02.929
What happened to him?

14:06.367 --> 14:08.195
FALLON:
Maybe a movie
wasn't the best idea.

14:08.238 --> 14:09.544
Hey!

14:09.587 --> 14:12.286
Why don't we go down
to look at the horses?

14:12.329 --> 14:15.028
You know? Burn off that sugar
with a nice brisk walk.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.856
Or some chloroform.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.248
You have real horses?

14:18.292 --> 14:19.467
Of course.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.251
You're looking
at the Southeast Regional

14:21.295 --> 14:23.993
Junior Show Jumping Champion,
2009.

14:24.037 --> 14:26.648
I can jump. Want to see?Not particularly.

14:26.691 --> 14:28.476
Hey, hey, hey,
hey! Hey, hey.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.391
I'm a horse.Stop. What are you doing?

14:30.434 --> 14:31.609
Hey. Hey, hey.
Connor.

14:31.653 --> 14:33.568
Oh, my God.
Well, this is winter white.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.570
What is the matter with you?

14:35.613 --> 14:37.093
Oh, my God! Connor!

14:37.137 --> 14:38.747
Connor! God.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.836
Is this what your mother's been
dealing with for ten years?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.012
No wonder she ran away.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.840
My mom ran away?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.146
I didn't say that.

14:46.189 --> 14:47.799
Yes, you did. Where is she?

14:47.843 --> 14:50.106
Uh...
Okay, that's a fair question.

14:50.150 --> 14:51.891
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Please don't cry.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.414
Please don't cry.
I'm not good with feelings,

14:53.457 --> 14:54.545
yours or mine.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.460
Connor! Wait!

14:56.504 --> 14:57.592
Wait! Come back here!

15:03.380 --> 15:05.295
He came to surprise me.He was on his way

15:05.339 --> 15:06.470
into Fallon's partywhen the explosion happened.

15:06.514 --> 15:07.907
My God,
why didn't you say something?

15:07.950 --> 15:10.257
I-I just found out yesterday.

15:10.300 --> 15:13.129
And he called me from the
hospital when the police came

15:13.173 --> 15:15.131
to ask him questions.

15:15.175 --> 15:17.568
I told them what
I could remember.

15:17.612 --> 15:20.310
I-I left the car, I was
walking to the party,

15:20.354 --> 15:22.747
and, boom,
I woke up on the ground.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.445
Wrong place at the wrong time,
I guess.

15:24.488 --> 15:26.838
But the police
might not think that.

15:26.882 --> 15:28.623
Especially with our last names.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.320
And I couldn't risk him
staying here

15:30.364 --> 15:32.279
and getting blamedfor something that he didn't do.

15:32.322 --> 15:33.715
You should have told me.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.543
I didn't want to put it
on your plate,

15:35.586 --> 15:37.197
with everything else.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.764
So I lied
about the bridal shower.

15:43.072 --> 15:45.466
You don't ever
have to lie to me.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.642
We're a team,
remember?

15:48.860 --> 15:50.123
Now, let's get him home.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.298
PILOT:Ready, Mr. Carrington?

15:51.341 --> 15:52.212
Yeah.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.044
Thank you.

15:58.087 --> 16:01.047
I can't believe someoneis serving me drinks here.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.527
Wasn't long ago thatI was standing behind that bar.

16:03.571 --> 16:07.357
Yeah. And now you're about
to record your first album.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.403
I think I already know what
the first single's gonna be.

16:09.446 --> 16:10.752
Have I heard it?

16:10.795 --> 16:12.232
Nobody has.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.408
But you can bethe first.

16:14.451 --> 16:17.019
♪ Do you want

16:17.063 --> 16:18.194
♪ Do you want

16:18.238 --> 16:21.110
♪ Do you want me?

16:21.154 --> 16:23.591
♪ Oh, you know

16:23.634 --> 16:27.334
♪ What you do to me

16:27.377 --> 16:30.250
♪ You know the way I feel

16:30.293 --> 16:32.861
♪ You knowthe way I feel... ♪

16:32.904 --> 16:34.558
Brava!

16:34.602 --> 16:36.169
Ay, Vanessa.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.648
I-I knew

16:37.692 --> 16:40.434
you had something special
from the moment I hired you.

16:40.477 --> 16:42.610
I don't want to say I
discovered her, but, uh,

16:42.653 --> 16:45.395
remember who gave you your firstgig here in Atlanta.

16:45.439 --> 16:46.831
Monica?

16:46.875 --> 16:49.791
The point is that I'm a
patron of the arts, okay?

16:49.834 --> 16:51.880
Speaking of which,
how's the album coming?

16:51.923 --> 16:55.188
I go into the studio next week.No, no, no, no. Cut, cut.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.842
How come no one told me that
my shirt looked like this?

16:57.886 --> 16:59.409
You can't just yell cut, Sam.

16:59.453 --> 17:00.845
Well, no one told me that,
either.

17:00.889 --> 17:02.586
Can we just
take it again?

17:02.630 --> 17:04.371
From my entrance?Sure.

17:04.414 --> 17:05.502
You know what...

17:05.546 --> 17:06.895
I don't think
this is the right shirt.

17:06.938 --> 17:08.244
I'm gonna go change.
It'll be quick.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.468
Look, so, I don't knowwhat you're up to tonight,

17:14.511 --> 17:17.906
but we're having a little partyfor the single release.

17:17.949 --> 17:19.690
And I just figured,since you were

17:19.734 --> 17:21.475
a part of the whole album
coming together,

17:21.518 --> 17:23.216
you should celebrate with us.

17:24.304 --> 17:25.914
If you want to.

17:25.957 --> 17:28.221
SAM:
Okay. Ready.

17:28.264 --> 17:31.485
Thank God. Let's roll.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.054
How did you get all this?

17:35.097 --> 17:36.098
I just called
the company

17:36.142 --> 17:37.839
and said I was Mr. Carrington.

17:37.882 --> 17:40.015
I didn't say
which Mr. Carrington.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.408
Mmm. You mighthave Blake's name,

17:41.451 --> 17:43.714
but you gotyour resourcefulness from me.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.412
So, it turns out that Chlorcyte

17:45.455 --> 17:47.762
was onto something
for neurotoxicity.

17:47.805 --> 17:49.633
Jeff said they were years away.Well,

17:49.677 --> 17:51.331
the drugs they were studying
are already on the market,

17:51.374 --> 17:53.115
just for other uses.
The problem is,

17:53.159 --> 17:55.074
the potential side effects,
when taken together,

17:55.117 --> 17:57.859
are too risky for the FDA
to approve a human trial.

17:57.902 --> 17:59.600
Which is why none of his
doctors brought it up.

17:59.643 --> 18:02.385
But I think this is
the best chance we have

18:02.429 --> 18:04.605
to stop his decline.Can you get the pills?

18:04.648 --> 18:06.085
Not legally.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.478
I'd have to find a wayto steal them from the hospital,

18:08.522 --> 18:12.439
and if someone found out,
I'd lose my license for good.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.615
Not to mention,
this is still a risk for Jeff.

18:14.658 --> 18:17.400
If the disease doesn't kill him,the treatment might.

18:17.444 --> 18:19.054
But I think
it's worth it.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.273
I can explain it to him.No.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.101
Maybe I should do that.

18:22.144 --> 18:25.365
He's not exactly
your biggest fan, and, well,

18:25.408 --> 18:28.150
I have a very good
bedside manner.

18:29.673 --> 18:31.458
Connor?

18:31.501 --> 18:33.416
Connor, I don't know
if you can hear me,

18:33.460 --> 18:36.506
but I-I really, really didn't
mean what I said earlier.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.639
I mean, I...
I meant it at the time,

18:38.682 --> 18:41.642
but you can have all the candy
you want if you just come out.

18:41.685 --> 18:43.339
Connor?

18:43.383 --> 18:46.386
Fallon. What are you doing here?

18:46.429 --> 18:50.520
Well, I... Right now,
looking for a missing child.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.479
Have you seen Connor?No. what happened?

18:52.522 --> 18:53.697
Oh, no, no, no.
Nothing, nothing.

18:53.741 --> 18:55.873
We were just, uh,
playing hide-and-seek.

18:55.917 --> 18:58.137
Oh, darling.
That's what the help is for.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.442
Okay, well, it was
his turn to hide,

18:59.486 --> 19:01.009
and I'm afraid
he might have gotten lost.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.576
So I know he went this way.

19:02.619 --> 19:05.187
Maybe if you take the south
side and I can take the north?

19:05.231 --> 19:06.754
Uh...Oh, I'm sorry.

19:06.797 --> 19:09.409
Unless you have something
more important you have to do.

19:09.452 --> 19:11.106
Of course not.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.369
Great.
I'll meet you by the pond.

19:14.414 --> 19:15.545
Connor?

19:15.589 --> 19:17.417
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.464
Really?

19:21.508 --> 19:25.033
Well, I think that went great.
Don't you?

19:25.076 --> 19:28.036
This print? So much better.

19:28.079 --> 19:29.994
I'd say it was the best part.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.171
You're joking, but, uh,
I'm not gonna let Dominique

19:32.214 --> 19:33.476
milk this whole thing herself.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.651
All right?

19:34.695 --> 19:36.392
I am performing
a public service here,

19:36.436 --> 19:39.047
if you think about it,
and if it happens

19:39.090 --> 19:41.397
to help the hotel
or get me laid,

19:41.441 --> 19:43.225
I'll take it.
See?

19:43.269 --> 19:45.009
You don't even need a wingman.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.229
Speaking of which,
Vanessa invited me

19:47.273 --> 19:49.057
to her single release party.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.320
She wants you
to stay on the show?

19:51.364 --> 19:52.756
I don't know what she wants.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.889
When she asked me
to be a part of this,

19:54.932 --> 19:57.239
she made it pretty clear thatwe're not getting back together,

19:57.283 --> 19:59.850
and now I'm getting
mixed signals.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.243
Must have been the pancakes.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.549
Bro.

20:02.592 --> 20:05.291
I'm being serious.
I can't tell who's asking,

20:05.334 --> 20:07.031
whether it's
Vanessa the reality star

20:07.075 --> 20:08.337
or Vanessa the person.

20:08.381 --> 20:10.687
And if she is actually
reconsidering us,

20:10.731 --> 20:12.472
the cameras are still gonna
be there, and do I want

20:12.515 --> 20:14.517
to be a part of this show
more than I already am?

20:14.561 --> 20:15.823
And this close to Dominique?

20:15.866 --> 20:17.868
Whoa, whoa.
Slow down, superstar.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.828
Just take it
one party at a time.

20:20.871 --> 20:22.308
So you think I should go?

20:22.351 --> 20:25.354
Well, I think that every
relationship has its baggage,

20:25.398 --> 20:27.269
and if you're not ready
to let Vanessa go,

20:27.313 --> 20:31.317
then don't let Dominique
scare you away.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.623
Come on, man.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.629
Well, did you look in your olddoll room or the gun closet?

20:39.673 --> 20:41.109
I mean, I could go look.Yeah, yeah.

20:41.152 --> 20:42.719
Why don't you check thewine cellar while you're at it?

20:42.763 --> 20:43.894
Maybe he needed a drink.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.287
Well, excuse me
for trying to help.

20:45.331 --> 20:46.984
I'm not the one
who lost him.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.682
I-I had to close my eyes.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.988
Okay? Peeking duringhide-and-seek

20:51.032 --> 20:53.513
is a fundamental violation
of the social contract.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.343
How do you know which
direction he went?

20:58.344 --> 21:00.520
Fine, Sherlock.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.304
We weren't playing
hide-and-seek.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.915
I might have accidentally
let it slip

21:04.959 --> 21:07.178
that his mother abandoned him.Heidi's gone?

21:07.222 --> 21:08.832
Yes. She left a note
and disappeared,

21:08.876 --> 21:11.966
which, in the scheme of things,is way worse than what I did.

21:12.009 --> 21:13.489
Not something to brag about.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.317
I am not the guilty one here,
okay?

21:15.361 --> 21:16.449
And if there's anyone to blame

21:16.492 --> 21:18.277
about my lack
of maternal instincts,

21:18.320 --> 21:19.974
it's you.Oh, here we go again.

21:20.017 --> 21:22.019
I'm here now, aren't I?

21:22.063 --> 21:25.414
Despite pressing business
of my own, not that you asked.

21:25.458 --> 21:28.199
No, but I should have guessed.Because even when you were here,

21:28.243 --> 21:30.071
you were never really here.

21:30.114 --> 21:31.464
Why don't you just go.

21:31.507 --> 21:33.683
Fallon...No, no, no, no, no.
I mean it, okay?

21:33.727 --> 21:35.729
I have figured things out
without you before.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.513
I can do that now.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.395
Connor?

21:50.700 --> 21:52.354
What are you
doing up there?

21:56.793 --> 21:58.317
PILOT:
We should be on the ground

21:58.360 --> 22:00.188
in Mexico in 30 minutes.

22:09.284 --> 22:10.329
BLAKE:Uh, honey, hey.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.722
It's a small plane.
He'll be okay.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.430
BLAKE:Beto? Hey.

22:24.473 --> 22:25.648
Beto? Hey, hey.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.302
Can you hear me?He's not breathing.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.390
Oh, he's not breathing!

22:28.434 --> 22:29.913
He's choking on something.

22:39.227 --> 22:40.184
Oh, he's breathing.

22:40.228 --> 22:43.231
What are you taking in there?

22:43.274 --> 22:44.580
Pain pills.

22:44.624 --> 22:47.366
He must have been trying
to take more.

23:09.605 --> 23:11.564
Am I interrupting something?

23:11.607 --> 23:14.001
I don't want to havethis conversation again, Alexis.

23:14.044 --> 23:16.133
All right?
I need to concentrate.

23:16.177 --> 23:17.439
Damn it.

23:17.483 --> 23:18.397
I lost count again.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.442
I'm sorry.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.748
I didn't mean to be dismissive,

23:21.791 --> 23:24.011
and I didn't mean to yesterday.

23:24.054 --> 23:26.448
I'm just worried about you.Yeah, well,

23:26.492 --> 23:28.537
I'm a grown man, okay?I know.

23:28.581 --> 23:31.497
And I know that this isa pragmatic arrangement,

23:31.540 --> 23:33.281
but you're my husband.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.459
Well, I appreciate that.

23:37.503 --> 23:38.852
Uh...

23:38.895 --> 23:42.029
I'm just not used to
being taken care of.

23:42.072 --> 23:46.163
You're usually the onelooking out for everyone else.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.470
And you've made itthis far.

23:48.514 --> 23:50.037
I just don't want you
to miss out

23:50.080 --> 23:51.517
on something
that could help you.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.215
Including traditional medicine.

23:54.258 --> 23:56.609
Look, I told you,
traditional medicine

23:56.652 --> 23:58.785
is at least a decade
away from helping me.

23:58.828 --> 24:01.570
What if Chlorcyte was closer
than you thought?

24:02.702 --> 24:04.486
What do you know
about Chlorcyte?

24:04.530 --> 24:06.619
Adam got his handson their research.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.882
The drugs that they'relooking at are out there.

24:08.925 --> 24:11.885
It's just a matterof putting them together.

24:11.928 --> 24:14.627
It's a risk, of course,

24:14.670 --> 24:16.629
but he can get the pills.

24:16.672 --> 24:19.588
So, you want me to accept
controlled substances

24:19.632 --> 24:21.590
from the guy who
already poisoned me?

24:21.634 --> 24:22.852
I thought we were past that.

24:22.896 --> 24:24.506
How do you get past that?Okay,

24:24.550 --> 24:26.856
but he wantsto make things right.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.946
He is willing to riska lot to help you.

24:29.990 --> 24:31.948
This is my life, Alexis.

24:31.992 --> 24:34.429
And there's no way I'm
putting it in his hands.

24:37.171 --> 24:38.912
You can't stay up there forever.

24:38.955 --> 24:40.348
CONNOR:Leave me alone.

24:40.391 --> 24:42.176
Look, as much as my neck hurts,

24:42.219 --> 24:44.700
and I can barely
feel my toes anymore,

24:44.744 --> 24:47.529
I'm pretty sure this qualifies
as child endangerment, so...

24:47.573 --> 24:48.617
Aren't you cold?

24:48.661 --> 24:49.923
Maybe I can
take you inside

24:49.966 --> 24:51.664
and leave you alone there?

24:51.707 --> 24:53.709
No. I want my mom.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.581
Yeah. Not as much as I do.

24:55.624 --> 24:58.584
But your, uh...
Liam is going to get her.

24:58.627 --> 25:00.586
He said he was working.

25:00.629 --> 25:02.022
Yes. On that.

25:02.065 --> 25:04.198
And I promise, he is gonna
bring her back here...

25:04.241 --> 25:05.591
LIAM:Fallon.

25:05.634 --> 25:06.592
What's going on?

25:06.635 --> 25:08.681
Though maybe not today.

25:08.724 --> 25:11.553
Um, well, it's actually
a really long story, um...

25:11.597 --> 25:14.121
Fallon said my mom ran away.

25:14.164 --> 25:16.210
Okay, so maybe it's a
shorter story than I thought.

25:16.253 --> 25:17.733
I really...
I didn't mean to.

25:17.777 --> 25:20.693
I told you, this is way above
my childcare pay grade.

25:20.736 --> 25:21.868
LIAM:
Hey, Connor, buddy?

25:21.911 --> 25:23.130
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

25:23.173 --> 25:24.958
I actually just talked
to your mom.

25:25.001 --> 25:27.264
She got lost on her way
back from an interview.

25:27.308 --> 25:28.265
Is that true?

25:28.309 --> 25:29.658
:No. We missed her.

25:29.702 --> 25:31.486
I want to talk to her.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.053
Okay, well, come down,
and we can call her.

25:33.096 --> 25:34.271
No.

25:34.315 --> 25:36.578
Call her now
and put her on speakerphone.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.145
You see?
This is what happens

25:38.188 --> 25:40.364
when kids get
too much screen time.

25:40.408 --> 25:42.018
Okay, hey, hey.
I'm-I'm calling her right now.

25:42.062 --> 25:44.020
:It's worth a try.

25:45.631 --> 25:46.936
HEIDI:
Hi. You've reached Heidi.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.242
Sorry I missed you.

25:48.285 --> 25:50.287
I knew it!
You were lying!

25:50.331 --> 25:51.767
Okay, now what?

25:51.811 --> 25:54.248
Hey, I'm coming up thereright now so we can talk, okay?

25:54.291 --> 25:56.424
No. Get away.

25:59.862 --> 26:01.908
PILOT:We should be back on the groundin Atlanta

26:01.951 --> 26:03.518
in just under four hours.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.086
BLAKE: Yeah, let's hope the
return flight's less eventful.

26:06.129 --> 26:08.218
Yeah, we deserve a drink
after the last few hours.

26:08.262 --> 26:09.655
No, a toast.

26:11.657 --> 26:15.356
Honey, Beto is with
the best doctors in Mexico.

26:15.399 --> 26:17.445
And if something comes up
with the police,

26:17.488 --> 26:19.490
we'll deal with it.
All right?

26:20.535 --> 26:21.971
He didn't do anything.

26:24.017 --> 26:25.888
Right.

26:25.932 --> 26:27.586
To us.

26:27.629 --> 26:29.152
No matter what
life throws our way,

26:29.196 --> 26:30.458
we always make the play.

26:30.501 --> 26:34.027
It's a baseball thing.I know what it means.

26:34.070 --> 26:35.768
Then what's going on with you?

26:37.378 --> 26:38.640
I want to help,

26:38.684 --> 26:40.294
but if you don't tell me,
I can't.

26:42.470 --> 26:44.037
I thought we were
on the same page.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.516
Nothing but the truth
from now on.

26:47.518 --> 26:50.043
The explosion
wasn't an accident.

26:50.086 --> 26:52.262
I mean, it was,

26:52.306 --> 26:54.917
kind of, but...

26:54.961 --> 26:57.920
Beto wasn't in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

26:57.964 --> 26:59.835
He was trying to plant a bomb.

27:01.924 --> 27:03.534
It went off too early.

27:03.578 --> 27:06.625
A bomb?

27:06.668 --> 27:07.756
Why?

27:08.844 --> 27:11.586
To blow up Alexis's car.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.935
And kill her.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.676
BecauseI asked him to.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.373
You tried to kill Alexis?

27:16.417 --> 27:19.681
After what she'd done to us,
I just couldn't move on.

27:19.725 --> 27:22.423
I needed to make her pay.

27:24.164 --> 27:26.645
And then I almost killed
my own brother in the process.

27:26.688 --> 27:30.474
Hey, hey, nobody died, Cristal.

27:30.518 --> 27:32.694
Beto's okay.
Alexis is okay.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.348
But I wanted to kill her.

27:34.391 --> 27:36.698
Do you know how many times
I wanted to kill Alexis?

27:36.742 --> 27:38.134
How could I blame you

27:38.178 --> 27:39.309
after what happened with Mack?

27:39.353 --> 27:40.920
How could you not?

27:40.963 --> 27:42.617
It's not okay, Blake.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.576
None of it is okay.
And I don't want it to be.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.317
Well, what's beating
yourself up gonna do?

27:47.361 --> 27:48.971
You sound just like my father.

27:49.015 --> 27:51.713
Justifying one thingafter another until

27:51.757 --> 27:52.845
nothing's ever wrong.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.284
It's why I had to get away
from my family.

27:57.327 --> 27:58.851
And then I just
walked right back

27:58.894 --> 28:00.374
into the same thing with you.

28:00.417 --> 28:01.375
Oh, that's not fair.

28:01.418 --> 28:03.246
Maybe not.

28:03.290 --> 28:06.728
But... I have to
break this cycle.

28:08.295 --> 28:10.514
Even if I have to do it alone.

28:21.438 --> 28:23.745
Sorry. Took a littlelonger than expected

28:23.789 --> 28:25.138
to get everything I needed.

28:25.181 --> 28:27.053
Had to tie up the pharmacy techin the broom closet.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.271
You what?!

28:28.315 --> 28:29.708
I'm kidding.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.622
But seriously,the less you know, the better.

28:31.666 --> 28:33.015
Adam, stop.

28:33.059 --> 28:34.713
Jeff isn't gonna do it.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.889
Because of the side effects?No, more because of you.

28:36.932 --> 28:38.542
Maybe we should just
give him some more time

28:38.586 --> 28:40.066
and let him see
the herbs don't work.

28:40.109 --> 28:42.155
The sicker he gets,the less these drugs

28:42.198 --> 28:43.547
will reverse the damage.

28:43.591 --> 28:46.028
If he can't see the forest
for the trees,

28:46.072 --> 28:49.510
maybe we need to do it for him,and then...

28:49.553 --> 28:51.512
he can thank us later.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.993
You want to drug him
without his consent?

28:54.036 --> 28:56.256
I'm guessing this is not
the first lie you've told him,

28:56.299 --> 28:58.040
and at least
this is for his own good.

28:58.084 --> 28:59.433
You mean ourown good.

28:59.476 --> 29:00.826
Everybody wins.

29:00.869 --> 29:03.176
And it's really simple. Look.

29:03.219 --> 29:05.221
I wrote it down.

29:05.265 --> 29:07.789
Here, um...

29:07.833 --> 29:09.878
This one is one capsule

29:09.922 --> 29:11.793
every morning
on an empty stomach.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.708
You can put it in his tea.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.232
And then these two
are both with food.

29:16.276 --> 29:18.191
Um, avoid alcohol
with all of these.

29:18.234 --> 29:19.627
You want to protect the liver.

29:19.670 --> 29:22.021
And you can start
with these today.

29:22.064 --> 29:24.980
But he's on his way
to Vanessa's party.

29:25.024 --> 29:27.548
I'm sure you'll find a way.

29:27.591 --> 29:29.593
I hear you're very resourceful.

29:33.815 --> 29:37.950
♪ Walk once,
where did everything go? ♪

29:37.993 --> 29:41.605
♪ If it feels good...

29:41.649 --> 29:44.565
VANESSA:
I mean, I grew up
listening to Whitney, so...

29:44.608 --> 29:46.610
I showed her The Bodyguard
when she was 12,

29:46.654 --> 29:49.570
and now here we are
celebrating her debut.

29:49.613 --> 29:51.354
SAM: Why is, like,

29:51.398 --> 29:52.703
everyone at this party hot?

29:52.747 --> 29:54.705
It's honestlykind of stressful.

29:54.749 --> 29:56.011
Uh, you're one to talk.

29:56.055 --> 29:58.187
I can count your abs
through your shirt.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.841
Mmm.You look like
some sort

29:59.885 --> 30:01.016
of sexy superhero.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.061
Why, thank you.

30:02.104 --> 30:03.714
I call him Sammy Ho.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.325
Sam, would you liketo get a drink?

30:05.368 --> 30:06.630
The bar's rightover there, darling.

30:06.674 --> 30:08.371
Well, I was hopingone of these Adonises

30:08.415 --> 30:11.331
would ask me, but I guessthey can get the next round.

30:11.374 --> 30:13.115
Have you seen Fallon?

30:13.159 --> 30:15.335
I'd like for her
to introduce your performance.

30:15.378 --> 30:17.076
No, not yet.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.603
I'll be back.

30:25.867 --> 30:27.913
You came.

30:27.956 --> 30:31.699
Well, it's not every day thatyou release your first single.

30:31.742 --> 30:35.224
And I'm kind of Sam's
standing wingman, so...

30:35.268 --> 30:37.226
Uh, can I get you a drink?

30:37.270 --> 30:38.662
Yeah.
Why don't I go with you?

30:38.706 --> 30:39.881
Can you give
us a minute?

30:39.925 --> 30:41.883
Well, I mean,I don't want to take you away

30:41.927 --> 30:43.711
from your own party.Please do.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.370
Vanessa, where
are you going?

30:50.413 --> 30:51.893
It's almost time
for you to sing.

30:51.937 --> 30:53.112
They'll wait.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.246
LIAM:
It's getting
pretty cold, Connor.

30:57.290 --> 31:00.684
What do you say we go inand get some hot chocolate?

31:00.728 --> 31:02.861
Yeah, I tried the same thingthree hours ago.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.732
CONNOR: I'm not going with you.

31:04.775 --> 31:06.125
With exactlythe same result.

31:06.168 --> 31:07.169
Connor, come on.

31:07.213 --> 31:09.128
No. You're a liar.

31:10.172 --> 31:12.827
You're right. He is.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.874
Seriously?We both are.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.484
Look, Connor, we, uh...

31:17.527 --> 31:19.225
we were tryingto protect you

31:19.268 --> 31:21.923
by not telling you the truthabout your mom,

31:21.967 --> 31:24.447
but I mean,now you don't have much reason

31:24.491 --> 31:26.667
to trust eitherof us, do you?

31:28.190 --> 31:30.323
Yeah.
All right, look,

31:30.366 --> 31:33.630
I'm gonna tell you something,
but you have to promise me

31:33.674 --> 31:35.937
you will never repeat it
to anyone. Okay?

31:37.330 --> 31:39.854
The truth is
I know exactly how you feel.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.856
Because my mom ran away, too.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.250
Now, I was a little olderthan you,

31:44.293 --> 31:46.687
but I was still a kid.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.732
And I remember how scary it was.

31:48.776 --> 31:50.647
But your mom is here.

31:50.691 --> 31:53.085
Yeah, well, she came back,
eventually.

31:53.128 --> 31:54.913
And I'm sure your mom will, too.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.437
But in the meantime,

31:57.480 --> 32:02.703
it is okay to feel scared,
and it's okay to feel mad.

32:02.746 --> 32:06.750
And it is definitely okay
to come down from that tree.

32:08.143 --> 32:10.711
Come on.

32:12.756 --> 32:14.410
I want to get down.

32:14.454 --> 32:16.064
Okay, I'm coming
to help you, bud.Go get him.

32:17.109 --> 32:19.328
What was that?He's gonna fall.

32:19.372 --> 32:21.287
LIAM: Connor!

32:27.858 --> 32:29.469
He can't swim. Hang on!Oh, my God.

32:37.172 --> 32:38.826
Connor.

32:38.869 --> 32:41.916
I got you, buddy, I got you.
I got you. Hang on to me.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.049
Got to calm down.
Hang on.

32:44.092 --> 32:45.920
Connor...

32:45.964 --> 32:47.661
You got to calm down, okay?

32:47.704 --> 32:49.576
Connor, Connor, Connor,
come here.

32:49.619 --> 32:51.360
Liam! Liam.I heard yelling.What happened?

32:51.404 --> 32:53.145
He fell in, he fell in.

32:54.494 --> 32:56.235
Get him!

32:57.279 --> 32:58.802
Connor, I got you.

32:58.846 --> 32:59.934
Calm down.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.502
I got you. I got you.Grab his arm.

33:02.545 --> 33:03.764
Yeah, yeah. Get him.

33:03.807 --> 33:05.766
Come on.Just grab his arm.

33:09.770 --> 33:11.511
Here you go.

33:13.904 --> 33:15.515
Connor. Are you okay?

33:15.558 --> 33:17.865
Come on, buddy.He's freezing.

33:17.908 --> 33:19.867
CULHANE:
Let's get him inside.

33:19.910 --> 33:21.738
Okay. Yeah.And call a doctor.

33:23.131 --> 33:24.741
I still don't even know
what we're doing here.

33:24.785 --> 33:27.701
You hate Dominique.I'm just here
to support Vanessa.

33:27.744 --> 33:29.355
And pee in Blake's pool.

33:29.398 --> 33:31.922
Where is Vanessa?

33:31.966 --> 33:34.316
And what on earth
is going on out there?

33:34.360 --> 33:37.537
I don't know. Something
by the lake, it looks like.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.843
Oh, God. It's not Fallon, is it?

33:39.887 --> 33:41.932
She was down there earlier.

33:41.976 --> 33:44.196
Will you go see
what's happening?

33:44.239 --> 33:45.719
I'll wait for your seltzer.

33:47.851 --> 33:49.549
♪ She looking in my eyes

33:49.592 --> 33:51.159
♪ Sucking the straw
in her cup... ♪

33:57.165 --> 33:58.558
We need to get him dry.

33:58.601 --> 33:59.863
FALLON:Okay, okay.I'll get some towels.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.826
Do we really not have
any towels in this place?

34:05.869 --> 34:07.306
I got it.ADAM: How is he?

34:07.349 --> 34:08.742
FALLON:
Well, he's freezing.
We need to warm him up.

34:08.785 --> 34:10.831
Towels.Thank you.

34:10.874 --> 34:13.268
Whoa, oh, oh, oh.
It's okay. It's okay. Hey.

34:13.312 --> 34:16.054
He's a doctor. Sort of.

34:19.144 --> 34:20.928
All right. He's not hypothermic.

34:20.971 --> 34:23.409
And his pulse is strong,
so that's good.

34:23.452 --> 34:25.846
He's okay?He will be.Are you?

34:26.890 --> 34:29.937
Thank you.
For everything.

34:31.939 --> 34:33.419
You're okay, bud.

34:33.462 --> 34:34.637
Fallon's fine.

34:36.030 --> 34:37.118
SAM:Connor fell in the lake,

34:37.162 --> 34:39.120
and then Liamwent in after him.

34:39.164 --> 34:41.775
And then Culhane went inafter both of them.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.255
Well, are they okay?I think so.

34:43.298 --> 34:45.300
Adam's checking Connor outin the kitchen.

34:45.344 --> 34:47.128
Fallon's gonna kill me
for leaving her.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.956
I'll be right back.

34:48.999 --> 34:50.044
SERVER:Champagne?

34:50.088 --> 34:51.524
Yes, sir. Right here.

34:51.567 --> 34:53.526
Of course.Thirsty?

34:53.569 --> 34:55.658
Why not?

34:55.702 --> 34:57.095
Cheers.

35:01.969 --> 35:03.057
Uh, hold this.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.798
Who the hell
are all these people?

35:04.841 --> 35:06.365
Dominique invited them.

35:06.408 --> 35:08.149
I don't care who invited them.

35:08.193 --> 35:11.326
I want everyone out of my house!

35:12.501 --> 35:14.590
Especially you.

35:14.634 --> 35:16.636
Out!

35:26.080 --> 35:28.082
Can we watch a movie?

35:28.126 --> 35:30.650
Aren't you tired? We've
all had a long day, buddy.

35:30.693 --> 35:32.869
Aw, let him have ten minutes.Yes!

35:32.913 --> 35:34.567
Oh! Ooh. Connor.

35:34.610 --> 35:36.482
Uh, sorry.

35:37.657 --> 35:39.049
That's okay.
That's all right. Listen.

35:39.093 --> 35:41.139
The first one up the stairs
gets to pick the movie.

35:44.054 --> 35:45.012
Mom?

35:58.330 --> 36:00.114
Hi, sweetheart.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.421
Oh, my God,
I missed you so much.

36:02.464 --> 36:04.205
LIAM:
Heidi?

36:04.249 --> 36:05.859
Where the hell have you been?

36:07.121 --> 36:09.123
I'm sorry, I just...

36:09.167 --> 36:11.995
needed to clear my headfor a minute, you know?

36:12.039 --> 36:14.998
A-After ten yearsof doing this all by myself,

36:15.042 --> 36:18.001
I-I wasn't even surewho I was anymore.

36:18.045 --> 36:19.612
I-I panicked.

36:19.655 --> 36:22.876
So, you dumped him with tworelative strangers and took off?

36:22.919 --> 36:25.574
Hey, buddy. Why don't
you go over there

36:25.618 --> 36:28.316
and let me talk to
your mom for a second?

36:28.360 --> 36:32.146
You guys have a good life,
and I thought

36:32.190 --> 36:34.931
Connor could have a better one
here with you.

36:34.975 --> 36:36.890
But it didn't take longfor me to realize

36:36.933 --> 36:39.109
that I can't have
a good one without him.

36:39.153 --> 36:43.244
I... I'm his mother.

36:43.288 --> 36:46.291
I really am sorry for putting
you through all this stress.

36:46.334 --> 36:49.294
Us? What about your son?

36:51.557 --> 36:53.733
I'm so sorry, baby.

36:53.776 --> 36:55.822
We're going home,

36:55.865 --> 36:59.217
and I'm not going anywhere
ever again.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.609
She can't just take him.

37:00.653 --> 37:01.915
She's his mom.

37:01.958 --> 37:03.482
Okay, well, you're his dad.

37:03.525 --> 37:05.440
And I'm his cool stepmom.

37:08.051 --> 37:09.575
We're not justgiving up on him.

37:09.618 --> 37:12.621
No. Not without a fight.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.494
VANESSA:
Are you sure you're okay?

37:15.537 --> 37:18.366
Yeah. Everyone made itout in one piece.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.281
Except your clothes.

37:20.325 --> 37:23.458
Good thing they had someextra uniforms laying around.

37:23.502 --> 37:25.547
Sorry about the party, though.

37:25.591 --> 37:27.201
You didn't even get to sing.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.333
Everybody's heard it anyway.

37:28.376 --> 37:30.160
But it was supposedto be your moment.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.338
The moment's definitely over.

37:33.381 --> 37:35.165
You can get that.

37:40.083 --> 37:41.041
What's wrong?

37:41.084 --> 37:43.173
It's actually good news.

37:44.218 --> 37:45.524
One of our biggest sponsors

37:45.567 --> 37:47.917
was going to bolt yesterday
after everything,

37:47.961 --> 37:50.180
but they've just decided
to keep our deal.

37:50.224 --> 37:51.399
That's amazing.Yeah, apparently,

37:51.443 --> 37:54.184
they saw a video
of what happened tonight?

37:54.228 --> 37:56.361
Down at the lake.
I don't know how.

37:56.404 --> 38:01.322
But they've decided the Atlantixare family-friendly after all.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.368
Michael Culhane saving
a little kid's life

38:03.411 --> 38:06.414
sounded like something
people needed to see.

38:08.024 --> 38:09.374
It was you?

38:09.417 --> 38:10.766
You're more
than that tape.

38:10.810 --> 38:14.117
I just thought
that they should know that.

38:14.161 --> 38:17.730
It has been a
rough road so far.

38:17.773 --> 38:20.254
I know that you're worried
about all this.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.821
My stepmom, the show.

38:21.864 --> 38:24.302
But it's not all bad.

38:24.345 --> 38:26.086
I just thought
you should know that.

38:26.129 --> 38:29.524
In case you were thinking
of giving this another shot.

38:29.568 --> 38:31.352
Were you?

38:31.396 --> 38:33.876
I wouldn't say no.

38:48.282 --> 38:51.285
Are they all gone?

38:51.329 --> 38:52.460
Finally.

38:54.941 --> 38:57.465
I told Dominiqueto pack her bags, too.

38:57.509 --> 38:59.467
It was just a party, Blake.

38:59.511 --> 39:02.514
Do you think she deserves
a second chance?

39:02.557 --> 39:05.125
Everyone does.

39:05.168 --> 39:06.692
At least, I hope so.

39:06.735 --> 39:09.390
Me, too.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.305
I don't want to lose you.

39:18.486 --> 39:21.446
I wasn't trying to give you
an ultimatum.

39:21.489 --> 39:24.405
I don't want to make you dosomething you don't want to do.

39:24.449 --> 39:27.147
I want to do better.
With you, if you'll let me.

39:27.190 --> 39:28.931
But if you want

39:28.975 --> 39:31.325
to be alone, if you're trying
to get out of this marriage...

39:31.369 --> 39:32.761
I love you, Blake.

39:34.763 --> 39:36.504
It's me that I can't live with.

39:36.548 --> 39:39.942
Not like this, at least.

39:39.986 --> 39:42.118
You're the best thing
in my life, Cristal.

39:42.162 --> 39:43.946
I'll do whatever I can
to make yours better.

39:43.990 --> 39:45.208
You just tell me how.

39:48.386 --> 39:53.216
Well, I was thinking of
working with patients again,

39:53.260 --> 39:55.436
at a clinic.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.265
And if we got the Carrington
Foundation involved,

39:58.308 --> 40:00.267
we could do even more.

40:00.310 --> 40:02.051
Like, a program
at the hospital

40:02.095 --> 40:04.053
for patients who
can't afford to pay.

40:04.097 --> 40:05.446
Well, that's exactlythe kind of thing

40:05.490 --> 40:08.188
the foundation is for.

40:08.231 --> 40:10.190
You see?

40:10.233 --> 40:12.235
We're already better together.

40:19.852 --> 40:22.289
VANESSA:
I'll take one of those.

40:22.332 --> 40:23.899
Did Michael leave?

40:23.943 --> 40:25.466
I just walked him out.

40:25.510 --> 40:26.685
Well?

40:26.728 --> 40:28.382
Is it done?

40:28.426 --> 40:32.125
He is in.
For the moment, at least.

40:32.168 --> 40:35.258
Well, that certainly calls
for a drink.

40:35.302 --> 40:40.002
To House of Deveraux'snewestcast member Michael Culhane

40:40.046 --> 40:42.831
and the whole new audience
he opens up for us.

40:42.875 --> 40:44.267
And to my girl,

40:44.311 --> 40:47.706
for doing whatever it takesto keep him on the show.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.408
I'm gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

40:54.452 --> 40:55.627
Uh...

40:55.670 --> 40:57.411
Actually, I-I think
I should go to bed.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.631
I'm-I'm not feeling so well.

40:59.674 --> 41:01.154
What's wrong?

41:01.197 --> 41:03.417
I don't know.
A little dizzy, I guess.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.767
I only had a few drinks
at the party, but...

41:05.811 --> 41:07.769
they must have
hit me pretty hard.

41:07.813 --> 41:09.118
You were drinking?

41:09.162 --> 41:10.816
It was a party.

41:10.859 --> 41:12.339
Let me get you some water.

41:12.382 --> 41:14.384
Nah, I'll-I'll get it.Don't be silly.

41:14.428 --> 41:16.430
Have a seat. I'll be right back.

41:20.434 --> 41:23.350
Get it together. Okay.
