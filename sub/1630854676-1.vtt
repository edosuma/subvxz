WEBVTT

00:48.791 --> 00:51.416
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

00:55.958 --> 00:57.333
Go, go, go! Go, go!

00:57.916 --> 01:00.250
We went over the plan five times.

01:00.250 --> 01:02.250
I got the package, didn't I?

01:02.250 --> 01:03.625
Just keep moving.

01:20.708 --> 01:24.208
Does this unscheduled break mean
you are fully versed in every ship

01:24.208 --> 01:25.375
in the Imperial fleet?

01:25.375 --> 01:29.291
Do I have to do this right now?
We're on a mission.

01:29.291 --> 01:31.958
That does not give you a pass
on your studies.

01:34.083 --> 01:37.041
Tech, we've got the cargo,
but we could use some firepower.

01:38.416 --> 01:40.333
<i>Wrecker woke the pod, didn't he?</i>

01:42.416 --> 01:45.375
Yeah, and they're not happy.
We need a pickup.

01:46.291 --> 01:47.708
Copy that. We're on our way.

01:53.750 --> 01:56.291
Tech, we caught something.
And I think it's big.

01:57.041 --> 01:59.791
Release the line.
We do not have time to reel--

02:06.583 --> 02:08.083
Omega!

02:09.875 --> 02:11.541
- I'm okay.
- Hang on.

02:14.666 --> 02:16.000
They're wrecking the ship!

02:16.000 --> 02:17.500
I cannot shake them.

02:42.916 --> 02:44.291
Uh-oh.

02:52.708 --> 02:53.708
<i>Grab the line.</i>

03:05.083 --> 03:07.000
Tech, where are you?

03:10.833 --> 03:12.750
Why is Omega hanging off the ship?

03:12.750 --> 03:14.833
<i>It is an unscheduled study break.</i>

03:41.375 --> 03:44.541
I thought the beach
was gonna be relaxing.

03:44.541 --> 03:49.416
Appreciate the backup,
but try staying inside the ship next time.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.250
I'll try.

03:53.416 --> 03:54.875
But it was still pretty fun.

04:04.166 --> 04:07.250
Greetings. It is I, AZI-345211--

04:07.250 --> 04:08.833
Yeah, yeah, we know.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.333
You are all quite late.

04:11.833 --> 04:15.041
Mistress Cid has been extremely vocal
about her displeasure.

04:15.041 --> 04:16.583
Well, there's a surprise.

04:19.416 --> 04:24.416
Well, well, well.
The space lugs decided to finally show up.

04:24.416 --> 04:27.708
Better late than dead, I always say.

04:28.291 --> 04:30.375
And who are you?

04:30.958 --> 04:32.541
Wouldn't you like to know?

04:34.166 --> 04:38.708
So, this is the top team
you've been talking about?

04:39.416 --> 04:44.583
The rogue clones on the run
from the Empire, huh? How juicy.

04:44.583 --> 04:45.875
You told her?

04:45.875 --> 04:47.458
Don't get twitchy.

04:47.458 --> 04:50.916
Phee's a friend.
She's the most trustworthy pirate I know.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.958
Is that supposed to be comforting?

04:53.541 --> 04:57.583
Aren't clones supposed to look alike?
So much for quality control.

04:58.208 --> 05:03.208
This one's too big. This one's too small.
This one's got a face tattoo.

05:04.125 --> 05:05.500
Yeah, real subtle.

05:05.500 --> 05:09.916
Oh. Hey now. Got a name, brown eyes?

05:10.500 --> 05:13.750
Tech. However, the phenotypic eye color
for all clones is brown.

05:13.750 --> 05:15.875
Iris pigmentation was not affected
by our mutat--

05:15.875 --> 05:20.583
Well, as fascinating as this has been,
I have places to be.

05:22.916 --> 05:26.041
You, let's see those muscles in action.

05:26.041 --> 05:28.083
Grab that and follow me.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.166
Uh, y-yes, ma'am.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.458
And, Cid, that intel is not free.

05:34.458 --> 05:38.458
I expect a cut
if your "top team" comes through.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.375
What is she talking about?

05:46.375 --> 05:50.500
Your next mission.
You lot are heading to the Outer Rim.

05:53.791 --> 05:57.666
That is Castle Serenno,
the former home of Count Dooku.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.166
Who's that?

05:59.166 --> 06:03.541
A Jedi who betrayed the Republic
and led the Separatists in a war.

06:04.541 --> 06:08.708
With him being dead,
Dooku's entire war chest is up for grabs.

06:08.708 --> 06:11.875
The Empire has already started pillaging
his palace,

06:12.583 --> 06:16.083
but there is still time to strike
before it's all gone.

06:18.166 --> 06:19.583
Too much of a risk.

06:20.083 --> 06:23.041
You want that war chest? You go after it.

06:27.916 --> 06:30.958
What class of shuttle? <i>Lambda</i> or Delta?

06:30.958 --> 06:32.125
<i>Lambda</i>-class.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.500
Very good.

06:33.500 --> 06:34.625
I'm in too.

06:34.625 --> 06:37.458
Good. Then we're all in agreement.

06:37.458 --> 06:41.041
Now, all we gotta do
is convince dark and broody.

06:41.541 --> 06:43.291
Convince me about what?

06:44.125 --> 06:49.208
Uh, well, we took a vote,
and we wanna go after the war chest.

06:50.541 --> 06:54.250
It's unanimous.
Even killjoy over here agreed.

06:55.083 --> 06:58.541
Serenno is Imperial occupied.

06:58.541 --> 07:01.291
We've stayed off the Empire's radar
since Kamino.

07:01.791 --> 07:03.000
Why chance it now?

07:03.000 --> 07:06.625
Because the contents
of just one of those containers

07:06.625 --> 07:10.416
would be worth more than all the jobs
you pulled for me combined.

07:10.916 --> 07:12.500
You can buy your freedom.

07:13.083 --> 07:14.458
We're already free.

07:15.041 --> 07:16.666
It's cute you think that.

07:16.666 --> 07:21.208
Clearly, you're not paying attention
to what's happening out there, but I am.

07:21.208 --> 07:24.666
It's only a matter of time
before the Empire comes here.

07:24.666 --> 07:30.375
And then my little operation is over,
which means no more jobs for you.

07:30.375 --> 07:33.375
She does have a valid point.

07:33.375 --> 07:35.583
You wanna really be free?

07:35.583 --> 07:40.041
Then pull off this heist,
and you'll have the means to disappear.

07:40.041 --> 07:43.583
No more risky missions.
No more living hand to mouth.

07:43.583 --> 07:48.041
You can have a future.
Isn't that what you're after?

08:11.625 --> 08:13.833
I know why you agreed to this mission.

08:14.416 --> 08:18.375
But we can do better things
with Dooku's fortune than hide, Hunter.

08:19.541 --> 08:23.333
With what we're up against,
we have to be prepared to fight.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.083
That means numbers and weapons.

08:25.666 --> 08:27.958
That's not the kind of life
this kid deserves.

08:27.958 --> 08:31.750
Our lives are like this because of Omega.

08:33.250 --> 08:36.291
Taking her off Kamino
was the right thing to do.

08:36.291 --> 08:39.041
But there are others out there
who need our help.

08:39.583 --> 08:42.791
We've seen what the Empire is doing
throughout the galaxy.

08:43.375 --> 08:45.750
We should be doing more.

09:28.375 --> 09:31.208
So, where is this palace?

09:31.208 --> 09:34.083
The city is on the opposite side
of this mountain range.

09:36.416 --> 09:37.416
Are you coming?

09:58.625 --> 10:01.916
That's the city? What happened to it?

10:01.916 --> 10:06.208
Imperial orbital bombardment.
Same as on Kamino.

10:24.416 --> 10:28.333
It appears that they are beginning
to transport the war chest off-world.

10:28.333 --> 10:31.125
Our window of opportunity
is quickly closing.

10:37.875 --> 10:40.166
There's over 40 troopers
down there.

10:40.166 --> 10:42.416
That's nothing.

10:42.416 --> 10:44.875
Stealth, Wrecker. Remember?

10:55.333 --> 10:57.250
Imperial escort ships.

10:57.250 --> 11:00.958
The standard protocol for when
high-level cargo is being transported.

11:00.958 --> 11:03.916
Get to the nearest container
and grab what you can.

11:03.916 --> 11:05.958
I'll be the eyes on the ground.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.291
If things go sideways,

11:07.291 --> 11:09.833
I'll divert their forces
and buy you some time.

11:26.416 --> 11:29.208
In position.
And the second transport's launching.

11:38.291 --> 11:40.625
We've got roving patrols. Stay alert.

11:55.625 --> 11:56.625
Let's go.

12:25.375 --> 12:28.166
What? I did it quietly.

12:28.166 --> 12:31.291
They will definitely notice
when he does not report in.

12:31.291 --> 12:33.541
Well, let's be gone by then.

12:33.541 --> 12:35.666
I'll keep watch. Start loading up.

12:37.875 --> 12:42.083
Whoa.
So this is what a war chest looks like.

12:42.666 --> 12:45.833
This is only a fraction of it,
but that is all we need.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.541
The priority is items of high value.

12:48.541 --> 12:49.666
Like what?

12:49.666 --> 12:52.708
Anything shiny or heavy is a start.

12:53.500 --> 12:57.041
Retrieve the remaining containers
from the palace. Stay on schedule.

13:02.958 --> 13:04.875
<i>Final launch in ten mikes.</i>

13:04.875 --> 13:06.166
Copy that.

13:06.750 --> 13:07.750
Did you hear that?

13:14.416 --> 13:16.250
It's nothing.

13:29.791 --> 13:31.250
Echo...

13:32.041 --> 13:35.833
I'd say that qualifies as high value.

13:35.833 --> 13:37.958
How could all of this
belong to one person?

13:37.958 --> 13:41.333
It is safe to assume
that the majority of Dooku's fortune

13:41.333 --> 13:44.250
came from the many worlds
he controlled and exploited.

13:44.250 --> 13:46.708
All in the name of his war effort.

13:46.708 --> 13:48.583
That's what corrupt people do.

13:48.583 --> 13:51.166
But isn't that what we're doing?

13:51.166 --> 13:53.125
Depends on how we use it.

13:54.541 --> 13:57.000
Sir, CT-8801 is not reporting in.

13:58.583 --> 14:00.833
CT-8801, report.

14:01.458 --> 14:02.958
<i>CT-8801, come in.</i>

14:04.208 --> 14:06.875
Hunter,
I think we're about to have some company.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.291
Find that trooper.

14:09.083 --> 14:10.458
<i>Are you clear?</i>

14:10.458 --> 14:12.916
Negative.
We could use that diversion about now.

14:12.916 --> 14:14.000
<i>On it.</i>

14:22.125 --> 14:24.083
Explosion on deck!

14:24.083 --> 14:25.625
<i>Send damage control!</i>

14:26.291 --> 14:29.333
Transport team,
fall back and hold your positions!

14:30.833 --> 14:32.541
<i>I'm heading your way. Be ready.</i>

14:32.541 --> 14:35.083
Let's speed this up.
Wrecker, that one goes first.

14:48.625 --> 14:49.791
The damage was contained,

14:49.791 --> 14:51.791
but two of the escort ships
were destroyed.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.375
What caused the blast?

14:53.375 --> 14:54.708
Unknown, Captain.

14:54.708 --> 14:57.125
All systems were normal
prior to the explosion.

15:00.083 --> 15:02.625
Transport Three, secure your cargo
and prepare to launch.

15:02.625 --> 15:05.083
All squads, return to the courtyard
and hold the perimeter.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.625
That is concerning.

15:22.208 --> 15:23.250
Where are the others?

15:23.250 --> 15:24.500
Still in the container.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.000
Tech, the ship's taking off.
Get out of there.

15:30.250 --> 15:31.750
Hurry, Echo.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.750
It's externally sealed. I can't open it.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.625
<i>Hunter,
we're trapped in the container.</i>

15:35.625 --> 15:37.416
-<i>We can't get out.</i>
- On our way.

15:37.416 --> 15:41.291
Uh, Boss?
I think they know something's up.

15:41.291 --> 15:43.583
We're done hiding anyway.

15:50.291 --> 15:52.333
We have a perimeter breach. Launch now!

15:59.750 --> 16:03.166
Ha ha! Come and get me!

16:07.250 --> 16:09.625
Oh, I'm starting to regret this.

16:18.625 --> 16:19.750
We gotta go.

16:19.750 --> 16:20.833
Go where?

16:22.375 --> 16:23.208
Jump!

16:27.375 --> 16:30.916
This isn't any better!

16:34.958 --> 16:36.500
Hunter, where are you?

16:36.500 --> 16:38.583
<i>Sorry, kid.
We got a little sidetracked.</i>

16:38.583 --> 16:41.500
You need to get off that ship
before it jumps to hyperspace.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.708
<i>If we gain access
to the ship's main hold,</i>

16:43.708 --> 16:45.541
<i>we could commandeer an escape pod.</i>

16:45.541 --> 16:48.041
Do it.
We'll get to the <i>Marauder</i> and recover you.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.208
It's gonna take a while.

16:53.333 --> 16:54.416
Quick! Inside.

16:55.458 --> 16:57.375
I want this area locked down.

16:57.375 --> 17:00.000
Security team, with me.
We'll flush them out.

17:01.750 --> 17:04.375
Are you sure this hatch
will lead into the ship?

17:04.375 --> 17:08.333
If I am incorrect, we will instantly
be sucked out and perish.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
I am seldom wrong.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.458
Congratulate yourself after we escape.

17:13.458 --> 17:16.208
The closest escape pod
is five corridors away.

17:34.958 --> 17:38.375
This place gives me the creeps.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.333
Freeze!

18:15.166 --> 18:17.291
Find an alternate route to the pod.

18:18.250 --> 18:19.916
<i>Captain Wilco,</i>

18:19.916 --> 18:22.041
<i>there are intruders
aboard Transport Three.</i>

18:22.916 --> 18:25.541
Release the escape pods.
It's their only way off the ship.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.625
They just ejected all the escape pods!

18:37.666 --> 18:39.791
There has to be another way off
of this ship.

18:39.791 --> 18:42.750
Other than overtaking this vessel,
what do you suggest?

18:42.750 --> 18:46.333
This is a class four freighter, isn't it?

18:46.333 --> 18:47.666
Yes, why?

18:47.666 --> 18:51.375
Containers on class four freighters
are equipped with reentry thrusters.

18:51.375 --> 18:53.583
We can escape in a cargo container.

18:55.166 --> 18:57.375
You are correct. I am impressed.

18:57.375 --> 19:01.291
However, the containers must be ejected
before leaving the atmosphere,

19:01.291 --> 19:03.750
which means our window is rapidly closing.

19:15.625 --> 19:16.625
Fall back!

19:22.291 --> 19:24.208
Any idea how we're getting out of here?

19:30.875 --> 19:33.291
We're not going out. We're going down.

19:33.291 --> 19:35.333
There's a lift below us. Cover me.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.375
What is taking you so long?

19:46.375 --> 19:48.958
I'm trying. Tech usually does this.

19:54.291 --> 19:55.291
It's jammed.

19:55.291 --> 19:56.958
Well, I can fix that.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.708
Wait! Don't! No!

20:26.583 --> 20:28.291
How much time do we have?

20:28.291 --> 20:29.375
Very little.

20:34.708 --> 20:37.083
Initiating the cargo release.

20:44.541 --> 20:46.750
When are the reentry boosters
supposed to fire?

20:46.750 --> 20:48.708
I think they should have by now.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.000
That is going to be a problem!
