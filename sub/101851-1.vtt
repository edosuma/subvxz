[woman] Fears of another wave intensify as the worldwide death toll rises.

00:04.349 --> 00:07.076
[man] As Los Angeles enters its 213th week of lockdown, the Health Department...

[male reporter
speaking Spanish]

00:09.216 --> 00:11.321
[female reporter 1]
...the Health Department
has raised...

00:11.459 --> 00:13.703
[male reporter 2]
Experts are reporting
COVID-23 has mutated.

00:13.841 --> 00:15.912
[male reporter 3
speaking foreign language]

00:16.050 --> 00:18.811
[female reporter 2] Today, Los Angeles opened its first quarantine zone.

00:18.949 --> 00:21.366
The Q-zone was created
to house the sick
and the dying...

[male reporter 4
speaking foreign language]

00:23.299 --> 00:25.611
[female reporter 1] Anyone with a fever will be taken to the Q...

00:25.749 --> 00:30.754
[reporters speaking
foreign languages]

00:30.892 --> 00:34.482
[woman] The mortality rate has risen to 56%.

00:34.620 --> 00:37.796
[man] Only the few people immune to the virus are able to leave their homes.

00:37.934 --> 00:41.317
[overlapping newscasts
in foreign languages continue]

00:41.455 --> 00:42.835
[female reporter 2]
Today, the CDC

00:42.973 --> 00:45.631
unveiled designs for America's new immunity passes.

00:45.769 --> 00:48.289
These passes come in the form of canary yellow--

00:49.290 --> 00:52.190
[birds twittering]

00:53.984 --> 00:56.608
[dog barking,

-[line ringing]

01:36.199 --> 01:37.097
[male voice] What?

01:37.235 --> 01:38.719
Yeah, I got a delivery here.

01:38.857 --> 01:40.100
You're late, asshole.

01:40.238 --> 01:42.171
Just put it in the box.

01:42.309 --> 01:45.277
[automated female voice]
UV sanitation activated.

01:47.279 --> 01:48.142
[machine chimes]

01:48.280 --> 01:50.627
UV sanitation complete.

01:50.765 --> 01:51.801
[machine beeps]

01:53.113 --> 01:54.804
-All good?
-[male voice] No tip.

01:54.942 --> 01:57.462
And tell Lester I want
a new delivery guy next time.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.740
You just hate me 'cause
I'm immune and you're not.

01:59.878 --> 02:01.224
What did you say?

02:01.362 --> 02:03.709
I said, "Don't forget
to toast the apocalypse."

02:03.847 --> 02:04.779
[helicopter whirring]

02:04.917 --> 02:07.196
[female voice]
Curfew is now in effect.

02:07.334 --> 02:10.440
All unauthorized citizens
must stay indoors.

02:11.683 --> 02:15.687
Remember the good old days of fake news? Real news is worse.

02:16.722 --> 02:20.554
Because any day, the antibody test is coming.

02:20.692 --> 02:24.351
Antibody test? I signed up for that #### shit three years ago.

02:24.489 --> 02:26.387
In a Burger King
drive-through.

02:26.525 --> 02:28.631
Guess what?
Burger King's gone.

02:29.908 --> 02:33.256
What'd they tell us for the last three #### years?

02:33.394 --> 02:35.879
Stay home and wash your hands.

02:36.017 --> 02:39.469
[male reporter 5] New data confirms the virus attacks the brain tissue.

02:39.607 --> 02:41.299
I've been hearing
a lot of weird rumors

02:41.437 --> 02:44.094
about the institutional corruption at the Department of Sanitation.

02:44.233 --> 02:46.925
[female voice] ...will be arriving in four to six hours.

02:47.063 --> 02:48.513
You must not attempt
to leave your home.

02:48.651 --> 02:50.860
Check out the new
immunity bracelet.

02:50.998 --> 02:53.414
Literally, can't leave
the house without this.

02:53.552 --> 02:56.728
I wonder if that's how dinosaurs went. Just like...

02:56.866 --> 02:58.454
[female reporter 3]
The global death count

02:58.592 --> 03:01.111
is now over 110 million.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.044
It's the end
of the world, bro.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.323
-[man] As Los Angeles enters its 213th... -It feels like the apocalypse.

03:05.461 --> 03:07.256
So, we just got to sit home,

03:07.394 --> 03:09.948
like gerbils, in our little bullshit cages.

03:10.086 --> 03:12.778
[man on PA] Noncompliance will be met with severe penalty.

03:12.916 --> 03:15.333
-Guess what.
-[man on PA] Lockdown
is in full effect.

03:15.471 --> 03:17.335
There ain't
no good news coming.

03:17.473 --> 03:19.682
[woman on PA] ...or you
will be shot on sight.

03:20.545 --> 03:22.098
[male courier] Hey, Lester. I'm held up, man.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.273
They're checking bags,
they're checking tags.

03:24.411 --> 03:25.998
Sanitation is on one today.

03:26.136 --> 03:29.450
[Lester]
Stop messing around, guys.
Rich people need their shit!

03:29.588 --> 03:31.383
[male courier 2] Lester, nobody's here for the pick-up.

03:31.521 --> 03:32.833
I've been waiting
about 15 minutes.

03:32.971 --> 03:34.559
Okay, turn that around
as soon as you can.

03:34.697 --> 03:36.423
Jonie, you're ten minutes late
getting to me. Come here.

03:36.561 --> 03:38.079
Hey, man, don't get bitchy with me.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.461
Anthony,
it's a left on Fountain. Left!

03:40.599 --> 03:41.911
[Anthony]
Man, I'm turning left.

03:42.049 --> 03:44.293
Put your left hand out,
check mark with the right.

03:44.431 --> 03:47.434
-Jeez, I gotta teach you
your ABC's too?
-I'm going right. Sorry.

03:47.572 --> 03:49.332
[man on radio] We're having a little delay.

03:49.470 --> 03:51.886
We're seeing a new checkpoint right there on Hollywood and Highland.

03:52.024 --> 03:54.717
Kyle Kuzma, he advances.
He gets it to LeBron.

03:55.821 --> 03:58.410
Lebron dunks for the win!
Yes, the crowd goes wild!

03:58.548 --> 04:00.826
[imitates crowd cheering]

04:00.964 --> 04:02.069
[phone ringing]

04:02.207 --> 04:03.622
You made
that priority drop yet?

04:03.760 --> 04:05.210
It's next on my list.

04:05.348 --> 04:08.593
Priority means
it's first on your list.

04:08.731 --> 04:10.284
Lester,
it's all the way across town.

04:10.422 --> 04:11.768
Hold up.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.046
Are you at the court?

04:14.184 --> 04:16.739
Uh... No.

04:16.877 --> 04:18.396
I have GPS.

04:18.534 --> 04:20.329
Then maybe.

04:20.467 --> 04:23.435
Make a three for Kobe
and get going.

04:30.442 --> 04:32.651
Hi, guys. What's up?
This is Larray.

04:32.789 --> 04:35.102
My best friend didn't pass his thermal scan

04:35.240 --> 04:38.830
and the Department
of Sanitation took him
to the Q-zone.

04:38.968 --> 04:43.041
So, I'm worried, 'cause once you go to the Q-zone, you don't ever leave.

04:44.007 --> 04:44.939
Good morning, Marie.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.734
Good morning, señora.

04:46.872 --> 04:48.391
I cut some fruit for you
in the kitchen.

04:48.529 --> 04:50.013
Thank you.

04:53.569 --> 04:54.742
Good morning.

04:54.880 --> 04:55.743
God, kid.

04:55.881 --> 04:57.642
-I have a question for you.
-Yes?

04:57.780 --> 05:01.231
So, I was wondering
about the whole Ellie thing.

05:01.370 --> 05:02.681
Yeah, what about it?

05:02.819 --> 05:05.995
So, her mom says
that it's fine

05:06.133 --> 05:10.310
if she comes and hangs out
for a little while.

05:10.448 --> 05:12.933
I'm sorry. You know
we can't have people over.

05:13.071 --> 05:15.453
-All we're--
-Not to mention,
it is illegal.

05:15.591 --> 05:17.247
What are you gonna do?

05:17.386 --> 05:20.527
Call Sanitation
on two 12-year-olds?
Have them take us to the zone?

05:20.665 --> 05:23.461
You keep pushing it,
and you might just find out.

05:23.599 --> 05:25.255
Did you take your vitamins?

05:25.394 --> 05:26.740
-Yes, Mom.
-Do you have your inhaler?

05:26.878 --> 05:29.398
-Uh-huh.
-Okay, you're up.

05:30.399 --> 05:32.573
[automated female voice]
Virus check in progress.

05:32.711 --> 05:36.715
Three, two, one.

05:38.476 --> 05:39.684
No virus detected.

05:39.822 --> 05:41.548
-Straight A's.
-Have a great day.

05:41.686 --> 05:43.653
So please go tell your dad
it's time to take
the temp test.

05:43.791 --> 05:46.622
Dad! Mom said
it's time for your temp test!

05:46.760 --> 05:48.451
I could have done that.

05:48.589 --> 05:50.902
[female reporter 4] ...by order of the mayor, who stated martial law

05:51.040 --> 05:53.594
shall remain in place for the foreseeable future.

05:53.732 --> 05:56.045
Today, the Department of Sanitation announced the opening

05:56.183 --> 05:58.392
of a new Q-zone
in Boyle Heights.

05:58.530 --> 06:02.120
The facility would be
the fifth of its kind
established in the city

06:02.258 --> 06:04.985
despite recent controversy over a leaked report

06:05.123 --> 06:08.057
describing conditions in these zones as barbaric.

06:08.195 --> 06:10.162
[automated female voice] Virus check must be completed.

06:10.300 --> 06:11.681
You have five minutes to--

06:12.302 --> 06:13.959
Virus check in progress.

06:14.097 --> 06:16.721
Three, two, one.

06:16.859 --> 06:20.000
No virus detected.
Have a great day.

06:28.491 --> 06:30.838
It's Nico, from Lester's Gets.

06:30.976 --> 06:34.048
Missus,
the delivery boy is here.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.535
Great, these are ready to go.

06:37.673 --> 06:39.053
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

06:50.789 --> 06:52.135
[automated female voice]
UV sanitation activated.

06:52.273 --> 06:53.999
[Nico] Ready?

06:54.137 --> 06:57.313
[Emma chuckles]
Do you think we're just
fish in a bowl to him?

06:57.451 --> 06:58.832
[chuckles]

07:02.042 --> 07:03.077
[machine beeps]

07:06.046 --> 07:08.220
[automated female voice]
UV sanitation activated.

07:11.396 --> 07:13.260
UV sanitation complete.

07:13.398 --> 07:14.606
Okay.

07:17.126 --> 07:18.161
Thank you.

07:19.369 --> 07:20.647
Really, thank you.

07:22.062 --> 07:23.546
[both laugh]

07:23.684 --> 07:25.445
Go this way.

07:28.551 --> 07:31.347
Yo, yo, yo!
Checking in per usual.

07:32.279 --> 07:35.109
New strain, new year.
Isn't that great?

07:35.247 --> 07:37.353
Looks like this one'll
kill you quick.

07:37.491 --> 07:41.219
They're saying people who are catching this are dropping dead within 48 hours.

07:45.050 --> 07:46.638
Yesterday I saw
a 10-year-old girl

07:46.776 --> 07:50.055
getting dragged from her house and taken to the Q-zone.

07:50.193 --> 07:53.196
Well, we know what
the "Q" stands for.

07:54.128 --> 07:55.405
"Quick death."

07:56.441 --> 07:58.339
All I'm saying is,
if you see those guys

07:58.478 --> 08:01.239
in those big-ass yellow suits coming up your block,

08:01.377 --> 08:03.344
you better hide
your little sister.

08:03.793 --> 08:05.485
[phone chimes]

08:06.486 --> 08:07.314
[chuckles]

08:07.452 --> 08:09.558
Good evening, Miss Garcia.

08:10.248 --> 08:11.663
Still on for date night?

08:11.801 --> 08:13.872
Oh, every night.
You can't get rid of me.

08:14.459 --> 08:16.392
You're such a stalker.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.670
Yeah, well,
it's easy when my victim
can't leave her home.

08:18.808 --> 08:20.154
You're not missing much
out here.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.018
Yeah, except for that view.

08:22.156 --> 08:23.951
Oh, you like that?

08:26.022 --> 08:28.715
This is my view, though.
I think mine's better.
Say hi, Lita.

08:28.853 --> 08:30.475
Hola, Nico. ¿Cómo estás?

08:30.613 --> 08:32.339
Hey, Lita. How are you?

08:32.477 --> 08:34.306
Muy bien, Lita, ¿y tú?

08:34.444 --> 08:37.965
-Estoy bien, ¿y tú?
-[young woman laughs]

08:38.103 --> 08:40.727
-Nico, please don't fall.
-I'm not gonna fall.

08:40.865 --> 08:44.006
If I did, I wonder how long it would take someone to find me out here.

08:44.144 --> 08:45.628
Are you kidding?

08:45.766 --> 08:48.769
Lester would have
a cleanup crew there in, like,
ten minutes, tops.

08:48.907 --> 08:52.152
[in deep voice]
Because a dead courier
is bad for business.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.948
I sounded just like him,
didn't I?

08:55.086 --> 08:58.089
I'll see you later, stupid.
I miss you.

08:58.227 --> 08:59.711
Give me an hour.

08:59.849 --> 09:02.093
I got one more drop-off I'm late for.

09:02.231 --> 09:04.060
I'm not going anywhere.

09:18.419 --> 09:19.628
[phone chimes]

09:23.839 --> 09:26.151
[phone rings]

09:26.289 --> 09:28.878
[Lester] Dozer, I need eyes on one of my couriers.

09:29.983 --> 09:31.950
High and tight.
High and tight.

09:42.202 --> 09:43.306
[beeping]

09:43.755 --> 09:45.032
Hello.

09:45.170 --> 09:47.241
Yeah, Piper, it's Steve, Gwen's husband.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.830
You did that save the rhino thing for us a few years back.

09:49.968 --> 09:54.973
Oh, yeah.
That was a great party.
What can I do for you?

09:55.111 --> 09:56.147
We, um...

09:56.285 --> 09:59.150
We wanna take a trip beyond the city limits.

09:59.288 --> 10:00.979
Heard you might have the hookup.

10:01.117 --> 10:03.741
Something to help us get past the checkpoints.

10:03.879 --> 10:06.571
Party will cost you 300 grand.

10:06.709 --> 10:07.883
Done.

10:08.021 --> 10:10.230
Okay, great.
Well, we'll be in touch.

10:16.236 --> 10:17.789
[pings, buzzes]

10:19.135 --> 10:20.481
[sizzling]

10:20.620 --> 10:22.449
[female newscaster] Three apartment buildings in Van Nuys

10:22.587 --> 10:24.106
were condemned today

10:24.244 --> 10:26.522
after a number of residents failed their daily virus check.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.145
A spokesperson
from the Department
of Sanitation

10:29.283 --> 10:31.354
issued a response
to the outbreak

10:31.492 --> 10:34.944
warning that the department was currently completely overwhelmed by the caseload

10:35.082 --> 10:37.913
and reminding citizens
that COVID is airborne.

10:38.051 --> 10:41.157
No one should leave their home for any reason.

10:41.951 --> 10:44.402
[man on radio, indistinct]

10:48.371 --> 10:50.166
[male courier 3] ...closed down in Echo Park.

10:50.304 --> 10:51.927
[Dozer] I have eyes on the target.

10:52.065 --> 10:54.688
Repeat, I have eyes on the target.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.356
What?

11:10.324 --> 11:12.188
[chuckles]

11:14.225 --> 11:15.951
[helicopter whirring
overhead]

11:16.089 --> 11:17.642
[indistinct radio chatter]

11:17.780 --> 11:20.680
-Stop! Show us your hands.
-Hey, whoa, whoa! I'm immune!

11:20.818 --> 11:21.784
Get on the ground! Now!

11:21.922 --> 11:23.130
I'm immune!

11:23.268 --> 11:24.787
[checkpoint guard]
He's got a bracelet.

11:24.925 --> 11:26.824
Guy's immune.
Have him walk on.

11:27.617 --> 11:30.310
Wow. You gotta be kidding me.

11:30.448 --> 11:32.381
You guys really need to work
on your people skills.

11:32.519 --> 11:35.487
-No loitering.

Help us to protect you. Please remain in your homes.

1:00:40.740 --> 1:00:42.362
I need you to get up
and get in the bathroom.

1:00:42.500 --> 1:00:44.675
-What's happening?
-Come on, honey.

1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:48.714
Shh...

1:00:51.717 --> 1:00:53.166
Put this on.

Now where is that girl?

1:01:14.463 --> 1:01:17.466
You think you can hide?
I'll find you.

1:01:17.604 --> 1:01:20.366
Bingo! Found Grandma!

Bag and tag the hag!

1:01:23.541 --> 1:01:24.991
Hey, where are you?

1:01:27.476 --> 1:01:30.687
Where the hell
is that little duckling?

[automated female voice] Stay in your homes. Repeat, stay in your homes.

My kingdom for a beer.

1:01:49.291 --> 1:01:50.430
Nothing.

1:01:51.224 --> 1:01:52.398
Oh, shi--

1:01:54.849 --> 1:01:56.471
Roses are red...

1:01:59.923 --> 1:02:01.165
violets are blue...

1:02:03.754 --> 1:02:05.756
you think you can hide...

1:02:06.999 --> 1:02:08.345
but I'll find you.

[man] Hey!

1:02:55.357 --> 1:02:56.945
Hey, give me a hand with this!

1:02:57.083 --> 1:02:58.153
Are you okay, Bobby?

1:02:58.291 --> 1:03:00.017
[heavy breathing continues]

1:03:03.641 --> 1:03:05.264
Then get her outta here.

1:03:11.097 --> 1:03:13.893

[gun cocks]

1:03:27.769 --> 1:03:30.427
How dare you
come into my house.

1:03:31.566 --> 1:03:33.292
I'm not here to hurt anyone.

1:03:34.155 --> 1:03:36.157
You've already
put my daughter's life at risk

1:03:36.295 --> 1:03:38.366
just by stepping foot in here.

1:03:38.504 --> 1:03:42.370
I came to you for help,
and you tried
to have me killed.

1:03:42.508 --> 1:03:44.821
Look,
I just needed information

1:03:44.959 --> 1:03:49.101
because I can't allow anyone
to know what we're doing here.

1:03:49.239 --> 1:03:52.621
Nobody knows, and no one will.

1:03:52.759 --> 1:03:55.866
Mrs. Griffin, I understand
you're just trying
to protect your daughter.

1:03:56.004 --> 1:03:57.937
I get that.

1:03:58.075 --> 1:04:02.114
Because I'm trying to save
the one person left in my life
that matters to me.

1:04:09.190 --> 1:04:11.468
I can't leave here
without that pass.

1:04:16.335 --> 1:04:17.439
Please.

Please help me.

Come on, get it down.

1:04:33.904 --> 1:04:35.250
Open it up.

1:04:36.562 --> 1:04:39.703
You better not
make me regret this.

1:04:39.841 --> 1:04:43.189
[automated female voice]
This building
has been condemned.

1:04:43.327 --> 1:04:45.640
The safest place
is your own home.

[Piper]
What's her name?

1:05:00.862 --> 1:05:03.002
I assume it's a girl.

1:05:03.865 --> 1:05:05.591
Sara Mia Garcia.

1:05:09.043 --> 1:05:10.423
Now what?

1:05:10.561 --> 1:05:12.011
Now we wait.

Stay in your homes.
We are here to help.

1:05:34.275 --> 1:05:39.556
If you believe your neighbor is defying mandatory lockdown, give us a call.

1:05:44.906 --> 1:05:46.701
Do you know
where you're gonna go?

1:05:48.220 --> 1:05:49.807
Far away from here.

1:05:50.947 --> 1:05:54.260
We're all just trying to
protect the ones we love.

[computer chimes]

1:06:05.685 --> 1:06:07.549
Thank you.

1:06:09.206 --> 1:06:10.414
Take care.

1:06:19.837 --> 1:06:21.563
Oh, shit.

1:06:21.701 --> 1:06:24.221
Hey, guys! Hold off!

1:06:24.359 --> 1:06:25.636
Stop!

1:06:25.774 --> 1:06:28.260
Okay, call them to stop.
Call them to stop!

1:06:28.398 --> 1:06:30.227
The girl is in a hazmat suit.

1:06:30.365 --> 1:06:33.161
[sanitation man]
Secure all personnel,
girl is in disguise. Over.

Yeah. Yeah.

1:06:56.736 --> 1:06:58.393
[line ringing]

1:06:58.531 --> 1:07:01.293
Hey, are you sure
it's okay if I come?

1:07:02.087 --> 1:07:04.813
No, it's fine.
Of course. Of course.

1:07:04.951 --> 1:07:07.816
-I'll see you soon. -Be safe getting over here.

Okay.

1:07:44.715 --> 1:07:46.338
Oh, shit.

Goddamn it.

1:07:55.795 --> 1:07:57.659
Get out of the car, May.

1:07:57.797 --> 1:07:58.867
You wanna play?

1:08:00.041 --> 1:08:03.009
-Please leave me alone!
-What? You wanna play?
Let's play!

1:08:03.148 --> 1:08:05.564
Let's play! Get out!

1:08:07.807 --> 1:08:10.293
Get out of the car
or I'll kill you.

1:08:10.431 --> 1:08:12.398
Did you think
you were just gonna leave me?

1:08:12.536 --> 1:08:15.815
I'll drag you out
by your neck.
Get out! Get out!

Breathe it in.

You don't get it, do you?

1:09:23.331 --> 1:09:24.953
[laughs]

1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:27.542
You're not stupid.

1:09:29.130 --> 1:09:31.408
No symptoms...

1:09:31.546 --> 1:09:36.448
after being locked up
with your infectious grandma.

1:09:37.932 --> 1:09:41.970
You'd be coughing up
your lungs right now,

1:09:42.108 --> 1:09:44.973
and that makes you immune.

1:09:47.804 --> 1:09:49.737
If that's true,
then let me go.

1:09:50.703 --> 1:09:52.464
I'm so sorry.

1:09:53.948 --> 1:09:55.674
That's not how it works.

1:09:55.812 --> 1:09:57.331
Take her.

1:10:08.065 --> 1:10:08.997
Sara!

1:10:09.135 --> 1:10:10.344
Sara!

1:10:36.370 --> 1:10:38.820
Well, she really captured
your likeness.

1:10:38.958 --> 1:10:40.512
Talented girl.

1:10:42.376 --> 1:10:43.687
Who are you?

1:10:44.516 --> 1:10:47.967
Before this shit started
to hit the fan,

1:10:48.105 --> 1:10:53.318
I used to drive garbage trucks
for the Department
of Sanitation.

1:10:54.250 --> 1:10:58.012
Then all of a sudden,
my superiors...

1:10:58.150 --> 1:11:00.083
they started to die off.

1:11:00.221 --> 1:11:01.981
[chuckles]

1:11:02.119 --> 1:11:03.673
And then one day,

1:11:03.811 --> 1:11:08.505
I was running
the whole damn department.

1:11:08.643 --> 1:11:11.301
[laughs] I did it. Four aces.

1:11:11.439 --> 1:11:13.855
It's called the Idiot. Look.

1:11:14.787 --> 1:11:16.996
Happens once in a lifetime.

1:11:17.134 --> 1:11:21.691
Emmett D. Harland,
once a lowly refuse collector,

1:11:21.829 --> 1:11:26.212
is now the thin blue line
between death...

1:11:26.351 --> 1:11:30.216
[chuckles]
and a miserable existence.

1:11:30.355 --> 1:11:32.771
Hey, uh, what about yourself?

1:11:33.496 --> 1:11:35.567
What did you do
before the fall?

1:11:36.982 --> 1:11:38.604
I was a paralegal.

1:11:39.778 --> 1:11:41.814
I was putting myself
through law school.

1:11:42.677 --> 1:11:43.851
Oh.

1:11:43.989 --> 1:11:46.612
Well, I guess it didn't
work out for everybody.

1:11:47.648 --> 1:11:49.753
That's your problem, Nico.

1:11:50.616 --> 1:11:54.551
You don't seem
to understand how good...

1:11:54.689 --> 1:11:57.658
us munies have it, huh?

1:11:57.796 --> 1:12:03.733
Only a handful of us,
like you and me, we're allowed
to roam around as we like.

1:12:03.871 --> 1:12:08.013
You want a new car?
Just go to the dealership
and drive it off.

1:12:08.151 --> 1:12:12.086
Go into a house
up in the hills
and just take over.

1:12:12.604 --> 1:12:14.951
We're untouchable.

1:12:15.469 --> 1:12:17.885
You see, munies...

1:12:18.575 --> 1:12:21.509
we're not human anymore.

1:12:22.441 --> 1:12:25.341
[chuckles] We're gods.

1:12:25.479 --> 1:12:28.930
And how do you use
your godly power? Huh?

1:12:30.069 --> 1:12:31.381
You run around

1:12:31.519 --> 1:12:37.111
and you try to save
some specimen
that is bound to die.

1:12:37.836 --> 1:12:39.355
I mean, what's wrong with you?

1:12:39.493 --> 1:12:42.806
You could have
the whole fucking world.

1:12:44.118 --> 1:12:45.084
Where's Sara?

1:12:45.222 --> 1:12:47.742
Oh, Sara? I don't know.

1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:51.746
She's halfway
to the Q-zone by now, I guess.

1:12:52.264 --> 1:12:53.610
I'm sorry.

1:12:54.266 --> 1:12:55.405
You won't be joining her.

1:13:04.103 --> 1:13:07.037
It's nice to know there's
something still out there
that can kill you.

1:13:07.175 --> 1:13:08.556
[Harland coughs]

1:13:09.868 --> 1:13:11.628
[groans]

1:13:32.373 --> 1:13:34.962
[recorded ringtone]
Answer the phone.
Answer the phone.

1:13:35.100 --> 1:13:36.550
-Answer the--
-Nico?

1:13:36.688 --> 1:13:37.999
I got something
I gotta tell you.

1:13:38.137 --> 1:13:39.725
Yeah, you told the Griffins
I was at their house.

1:13:39.863 --> 1:13:42.418
-Fair to say you owe me one?-I'm sorry, man.

1:13:42.556 --> 1:13:45.800
There's a sanitation transport
headed for the Q-zone.
I need to find it.

1:13:45.938 --> 1:13:47.561
That ain't gonna be easy.

1:13:47.699 --> 1:13:51.047
I have an ID, 0715-GLS.

1:13:54.430 --> 1:13:56.984
[Lester] I think I might know someone who can help.

1:14:05.441 --> 1:14:06.821
[line rings]

1:14:12.378 --> 1:14:15.899
I've already mapped out
every route from
Sara's place to the zone.

1:14:16.521 --> 1:14:18.212
We gotta search grid by grid.

1:14:18.350 --> 1:14:19.593
Copy that.

1:14:28.947 --> 1:14:30.189
[beeping]

1:14:33.089 --> 1:14:36.057
Keep heading southeast.
We're not seeing
anything behind you.

1:14:50.278 --> 1:14:51.970
H-Hold up! Hold up!

1:14:54.455 --> 1:14:56.802
Yup, 0715-GLS.

1:14:56.940 --> 1:15:01.013
The truck is headed
south on Western.
I repeat, south on Western.

1:15:04.603 --> 1:15:07.710
[Dozer]
We have visual confirmation.
Target is heading...

1:15:08.469 --> 1:15:10.367
Heading east on 8th.
We got 'em.

1:15:10.506 --> 1:15:11.783
Nico! We found her.

1:15:11.921 --> 1:15:14.302
She's headed east on 8th,
just past Western.

1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:16.477
They're almost at the zone, so you better book.

1:15:16.615 --> 1:15:18.617
[Nico] I copy that.

1:15:18.755 --> 1:15:21.068
[Lester] You're not gonna make it, man. Hurry up!

1:15:25.555 --> 1:15:27.799
[woman, through PA]
You have arrived
at Q-zone Alpha.

1:15:27.937 --> 1:15:29.490
Welcome to Q-zone Alpha.

1:15:29.628 --> 1:15:31.147
You must follow
all directions.

1:15:31.285 --> 1:15:33.218
All instructions
are mandatory.

1:15:33.356 --> 1:15:35.323
