[woman] Fears of another wave intensify as the worldwide death toll rises.

00:04.349 --> 00:07.076
[man] As Los Angeles enters its 213th week of lockdown, the Health Department...

[male reporter
speaking Spanish]

00:09.216 --> 00:11.321
[female reporter 1]
...the Health Department
has raised...

00:11.459 --> 00:13.703
[male reporter 2]
Experts are reporting
COVID-23 has mutated.

00:13.841 --> 00:15.912
[male reporter 3
speaking foreign language]

00:16.050 --> 00:18.811
[female reporter 2] Today, Los Angeles opened its first quarantine zone.

00:18.949 --> 00:21.366
The Q-zone was created
to house the sick
and the dying...

[male reporter 4
speaking foreign language]

00:23.299 --> 00:25.611
[female reporter 1] Anyone with a fever will be taken to the Q...

00:25.749 --> 00:30.754
[reporters speaking
foreign languages]

00:30.892 --> 00:34.482
[woman] The mortality rate has risen to 56%.

00:34.620 --> 00:37.796
[man] Only the few people immune to the virus are able to leave their homes.

00:37.934 --> 00:41.317
[overlapping newscasts
in foreign languages continue]

00:41.455 --> 00:42.835
[female reporter 2]
Today, the CDC

00:42.973 --> 00:45.631
unveiled designs for America's new immunity passes.

00:45.769 --> 00:48.289
These passes come in the form of canary yellow--

00:49.290 --> 00:52.190
[birds twittering]

00:53.984 --> 00:56.608
[dog barking,

-[line ringing]

01:36.199 --> 01:37.097
[male voice] What?

01:37.235 --> 01:38.719
Yeah, I got a delivery here.

01:38.857 --> 01:40.100
You're late, asshole.

01:40.238 --> 01:42.171
Just put it in the box.

01:42.309 --> 01:45.277
[automated female voice]
UV sanitation activated.

01:47.279 --> 01:48.142
[machine chimes]

01:48.280 --> 01:50.627
UV sanitation complete.

01:50.765 --> 01:51.801
[machine beeps]

01:53.113 --> 01:54.804
-All good?
-[male voice] No tip.

01:54.942 --> 01:57.462
And tell Lester I want
a new delivery guy next time.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.740
You just hate me 'cause
I'm immune and you're not.

01:59.878 --> 02:01.224
What did you say?

02:01.362 --> 02:03.709
I said, "Don't forget
to toast the apocalypse."

02:03.847 --> 02:04.779
[helicopter whirring]

02:04.917 --> 02:07.196
[female voice]
Curfew is now in effect.

02:07.334 --> 02:10.440
All unauthorized citizens
must stay indoors.

02:11.683 --> 02:15.687
Remember the good old days of fake news? Real news is worse.

02:16.722 --> 02:20.554
Because any day, the antibody test is coming.

02:20.692 --> 02:24.351
Antibody test? I signed up for that #### shit three years ago.

02:24.489 --> 02:26.387
In a Burger King
drive-through.

02:26.525 --> 02:28.631
Guess what?
Burger King's gone.

02:29.908 --> 02:33.256
What'd they tell us for the last three #### years?

02:33.394 --> 02:35.879
Stay home and wash your hands.

02:36.017 --> 02:39.469
[male reporter 5] New data confirms the virus attacks the brain tissue.

02:39.607 --> 02:41.299
I've been hearing
a lot of weird rumors

02:41.437 --> 02:44.094
about the institutional corruption at the Department of Sanitation.

02:44.233 --> 02:46.925
[female voice] ...will be arriving in four to six hours.

02:47.063 --> 02:48.513
You must not attempt
to leave your home.

02:48.651 --> 02:50.860
Check out the new
immunity bracelet.

02:50.998 --> 02:53.414
Literally, can't leave
the house without this.

02:53.552 --> 02:56.728
I wonder if that's how dinosaurs went. Just like...

02:56.866 --> 02:58.454
[female reporter 3]
The global death count

02:58.592 --> 03:01.111
is now over 110 million.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.044
It's the end
of the world, bro.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.323
-[man] As Los Angeles enters its 213th... -It feels like the apocalypse.

03:05.461 --> 03:07.256
So, we just got to sit home,

03:07.394 --> 03:09.948
like gerbils, in our little bullshit cages.

03:10.086 --> 03:12.778
[man on PA] Noncompliance will be met with severe penalty.

03:12.916 --> 03:15.333
-Guess what.
-[man on PA] Lockdown
is in full effect.

03:15.471 --> 03:17.335
There ain't
no good news coming.

03:17.473 --> 03:19.682
[woman on PA] ...or you
will be shot on sight.

03:20.545 --> 03:22.098
[male courier] Hey, Lester. I'm held up, man.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.273
They're checking bags,
they're checking tags.

03:24.411 --> 03:25.998
Sanitation is on one today.

03:26.136 --> 03:29.450
[Lester]
Stop messing around, guys.
Rich people need their shit!

03:29.588 --> 03:31.383
[male courier 2] Lester, nobody's here for the pick-up.

03:31.521 --> 03:32.833
I've been waiting
about 15 minutes.

03:32.971 --> 03:34.559
Okay, turn that around
as soon as you can.

03:34.697 --> 03:36.423
Jonie, you're ten minutes late
getting to me. Come here.

03:36.561 --> 03:38.079
Hey, man, don't get bitchy with me.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.461
Anthony,
it's a left on Fountain. Left!

03:40.599 --> 03:41.911
[Anthony]
Man, I'm turning left.

03:42.049 --> 03:44.293
Put your left hand out,
check mark with the right.

03:44.431 --> 03:47.434
-Jeez, I gotta teach you
your ABC's too?
-I'm going right. Sorry.

03:47.572 --> 03:49.332
[man on radio] We're having a little delay.

03:49.470 --> 03:51.886
We're seeing a new checkpoint right there on Hollywood and Highland.

03:52.024 --> 03:54.717
Kyle Kuzma, he advances.
He gets it to LeBron.

03:55.821 --> 03:58.410
Lebron dunks for the win!
Yes, the crowd goes wild!

03:58.548 --> 04:00.826
[imitates crowd cheering]

04:00.964 --> 04:02.069
[phone ringing]

04:02.207 --> 04:03.622
You made
that priority drop yet?

04:03.760 --> 04:05.210
It's next on my list.

04:05.348 --> 04:08.593
Priority means
it's first on your list.

04:08.731 --> 04:10.284
Lester,
it's all the way across town.

04:10.422 --> 04:11.768
Hold up.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.046
Are you at the court?

04:14.184 --> 04:16.739
Uh... No.

04:16.877 --> 04:18.396
I have GPS.

04:18.534 --> 04:20.329
Then maybe.

04:20.467 --> 04:23.435
Make a three for Kobe
and get going.

04:30.442 --> 04:32.651
Hi, guys. What's up?
This is Larray.

04:32.789 --> 04:35.102
My best friend didn't pass his thermal scan

04:35.240 --> 04:38.830
and the Department
of Sanitation took him
to the Q-zone.

04:38.968 --> 04:43.041
So, I'm worried, 'cause once you go to the Q-zone, you don't ever leave.

04:44.007 --> 04:44.939
Good morning, Marie.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.734
Good morning, seÃ±ora.

04:46.872 --> 04:48.391
I cut some fruit for you
in the kitchen.

04:48.529 --> 04:50.013
Thank you.

04:53.569 --> 04:54.742
Good morning.

04:54.880 --> 04:55.743
God, kid.

04:55.881 --> 04:57.642
-I have a question for you.
-Yes?

04:57.780 --> 05:01.231
So, I was wondering
about the whole Ellie thing.

05:01.370 --> 05:02.681
Yeah, what about it?

05:02.819 --> 05:05.995
So, her mom says
that it's fine

05:06.133 --> 05:10.310
if she comes and hangs out
for a little while.

05:10.448 --> 05:12.933
I'm sorry. You know
we can't have people over.

05:13.071 --> 05:15.453
-All we're--
-Not to mention,
it is illegal.

05:15.591 --> 05:17.247
What are you gonna do?

05:17.386 --> 05:20.527
Call Sanitation
on two 12-year-olds?
Have them take us to the zone?

05:20.665 --> 05:23.461
You keep pushing it,
and you might just find out.

05:23.599 --> 05:25.255
Did you take your vitamins?

05:25.394 --> 05:26.740
-Yes, Mom.
-Do you have your inhaler?

05:26.878 --> 05:29.398
-Uh-huh.
-Okay, you're up.

05:30.399 --> 05:32.573
[automated female voice]
Virus check in progress.

05:32.711 --> 05:36.715
Three, two, one.

05:38.476 --> 05:39.684
No virus detected.

05:39.822 --> 05:41.548
-Straight A's.
-Have a great day.

05:41.686 --> 05:43.653
So please go tell your dad
it's time to take
the temp test.

05:43.791 --> 05:46.622
Dad! Mom said
it's time for your temp test!

05:46.760 --> 05:48.451
I could have done that.

05:48.589 --> 05:50.902
[female reporter 4] ...by order of the mayor, who stated martial law

05:51.040 --> 05:53.594
shall remain in place for the foreseeable future.

05:53.732 --> 05:56.045
Today, the Department of Sanitation announced the opening

05:56.183 --> 05:58.392
of a new Q-zone
in Boyle Heights.

05:58.530 --> 06:02.120
The facility would be
the fifth of its kind
established in the city

06:02.258 --> 06:04.985
despite recent controversy over a leaked report

06:05.123 --> 06:08.057
describing conditions in these zones as barbaric.

06:08.195 --> 06:10.162
[automated female voice] Virus check must be completed.

06:10.300 --> 06:11.681
You have five minutes to--

06:12.302 --> 06:13.959
Virus check in progress.

06:14.097 --> 06:16.721
Three, two, one.

06:16.859 --> 06:20.000
No virus detected.
Have a great day.

06:28.491 --> 06:30.838
It's Nico, from Lester's Gets.

06:30.976 --> 06:34.048
Missus,
the delivery boy is here.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.535
Great, these are ready to go.

06:37.673 --> 06:39.053
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

06:50.789 --> 06:52.135
[automated female voice]
UV sanitation activated.

06:52.273 --> 06:53.999
[Nico] Ready?

06:54.137 --> 06:57.313
[Emma chuckles]
Do you think we're just
fish in a bowl to him?

06:57.451 --> 06:58.832
[chuckles]

07:02.042 --> 07:03.077
[machine beeps]

07:06.046 --> 07:08.220
[automated female voice]
UV sanitation activated.

07:11.396 --> 07:13.260
UV sanitation complete.

07:13.398 --> 07:14.606
Okay.

07:17.126 --> 07:18.161
Thank you.

07:19.369 --> 07:20.647
Really, thank you.

07:22.062 --> 07:23.546
[both laugh]

07:23.684 --> 07:25.445
Go this way.

07:28.551 --> 07:31.347
Yo, yo, yo!
Checking in per usual.

07:32.279 --> 07:35.109
New strain, new year.
Isn't that great?

07:35.247 --> 07:37.353
Looks like this one'll
kill you quick.

07:37.491 --> 07:41.219
They're saying people who are catching this are dropping dead within 48 hours.

07:45.050 --> 07:46.638
Yesterday I saw
a 10-year-old girl

07:46.776 --> 07:50.055
getting dragged from her house and taken to the Q-zone.

07:50.193 --> 07:53.196
Well, we know what
the "Q" stands for.

07:54.128 --> 07:55.405
"Quick death."

07:56.441 --> 07:58.339
All I'm saying is,
if you see those guys

07:58.478 --> 08:01.239
in those big-ass yellow suits coming up your block,

08:01.377 --> 08:03.344
you better hide
your little sister.

08:03.793 --> 08:05.485
[phone chimes]

08:06.486 --> 08:07.314
[chuckles]

08:07.452 --> 08:09.558
Good evening, Miss Garcia.

08:10.248 --> 08:11.663
Still on for date night?

08:11.801 --> 08:13.872
Oh, every night.
You can't get rid of me.

08:14.459 --> 08:16.392
You're such a stalker.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.670
Yeah, well,
it's easy when my victim
can't leave her home.

08:18.808 --> 08:20.154
You're not missing much
out here.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.018
Yeah, except for that view.

08:22.156 --> 08:23.951
Oh, you like that?

08:26.022 --> 08:28.715
This is my view, though.
I think mine's better.
Say hi, Lita.

08:28.853 --> 08:30.475
Hola, Nico. Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡s?

08:30.613 --> 08:32.339
Hey, Lita. How are you?

08:32.477 --> 08:34.306
Muy bien, Lita, Â¿y tÃº?

08:34.444 --> 08:37.965
-Estoy bien, Â¿y tÃº?
-[young woman laughs]

08:38.103 --> 08:40.727
-Nico, please don't fall.
-I'm not gonna fall.

08:40.865 --> 08:44.006
If I did, I wonder how long it would take someone to find me out here.

08:44.144 --> 08:45.628
Are you kidding?

08:45.766 --> 08:48.769
Lester would have
a cleanup crew there in, like,
ten minutes, tops.

08:48.907 --> 08:52.152
[in deep voice]
Because a dead courier
is bad for business.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.948
I sounded just like him,
didn't I?

08:55.086 --> 08:58.089
I'll see you later, stupid.
I miss you.

08:58.227 --> 08:59.711
Give me an hour.

08:59.849 --> 09:02.093
I got one more drop-off I'm late for.

09:02.231 --> 09:04.060
I'm not going anywhere.

09:18.419 --> 09:19.628
[phone chimes]

09:23.839 --> 09:26.151
[phone rings]

09:26.289 --> 09:28.878
[Lester] Dozer, I need eyes on one of my couriers.

09:29.983 --> 09:31.950
High and tight.
High and tight.

09:42.202 --> 09:43.306
[beeping]

09:43.755 --> 09:45.032
Hello.

09:45.170 --> 09:47.241
Yeah, Piper, it's Steve, Gwen's husband.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.830
You did that save the rhino thing for us a few years back.

09:49.968 --> 09:54.973
Oh, yeah.
That was a great party.
What can I do for you?

09:55.111 --> 09:56.147
We, um...

09:56.285 --> 09:59.150
We wanna take a trip beyond the city limits.

09:59.288 --> 10:00.979
Heard you might have the hookup.

10:01.117 --> 10:03.741
Something to help us get past the checkpoints.

10:03.879 --> 10:06.571
Party will cost you 300 grand.

10:06.709 --> 10:07.883
Done.

10:08.021 --> 10:10.230
Okay, great.
Well, we'll be in touch.

10:16.236 --> 10:17.789
[pings, buzzes]

10:19.135 --> 10:20.481
[sizzling]

10:20.620 --> 10:22.449
[female newscaster] Three apartment buildings in Van Nuys

10:22.587 --> 10:24.106
were condemned today

10:24.244 --> 10:26.522
after a number of residents failed their daily virus check.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.145
A spokesperson
from the Department
of Sanitation

10:29.283 --> 10:31.354
issued a response
to the outbreak

10:31.492 --> 10:34.944
warning that the department was currently completely overwhelmed by the caseload

10:35.082 --> 10:37.913
and reminding citizens
that COVID is airborne.

10:38.051 --> 10:41.157
No one should leave their home for any reason.

10:41.951 --> 10:44.402
[man on radio, indistinct]

10:48.371 --> 10:50.166
[male courier 3] ...closed down in Echo Park.

10:50.304 --> 10:51.927
[Dozer] I have eyes on the target.

10:52.065 --> 10:54.688
Repeat, I have eyes on the target.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.356
What?

11:10.324 --> 11:12.188
[chuckles]

11:14.225 --> 11:15.951
[helicopter whirring
overhead]

11:16.089 --> 11:17.642
[indistinct radio chatter]

11:17.780 --> 11:20.680
-Stop! Show us your hands.
-Hey, whoa, whoa! I'm immune!

11:20.818 --> 11:21.784
Get on the ground! Now!

11:21.922 --> 11:23.130
I'm immune!

11:23.268 --> 11:24.787
[checkpoint guard]
He's got a bracelet.

11:24.925 --> 11:26.824
Guy's immune.
Have him walk on.

11:27.617 --> 11:30.310
Wow. You gotta be kidding me.

11:30.448 --> 11:32.381
You guys really need to work
on your people skills.

11:32.519 --> 11:35.487
-No loitering.
-I'm sorry.
Am I holding up the line?

11:35.625 --> 11:37.524
Keep it moving,
you munie scum.

11:37.662 --> 11:39.112
Yeah, keep your mask on.

11:39.975 --> 11:41.770
Don't take that mask off.

11:45.152 --> 11:46.947
[over earphones]
It's your boy Adam W.

11:47.085 --> 11:51.158
Hey, check it out. So today, I want to shout out all of our immune workers.

11:51.296 --> 11:52.953
You mythical creatures,
you legends.

11:53.091 --> 11:57.061
So, these munies live alone. Total isolation.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.443
Talk about social distancing.

12:00.581 --> 12:02.204
And the whole time
they're out there,

12:02.342 --> 12:03.826
they're getting coated
in COVID.

12:03.964 --> 12:06.311
It's in their hair,
their clothes.

12:06.449 --> 12:10.039
And as one guy put it to me, that shit sticks.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.389
They can't go near friends or family, 'cause they might get them sick.

12:15.527 --> 12:19.739
Remember that the next time your pining for one of those yellow bracelets.

12:28.506 --> 12:29.852
Good as new.

12:32.130 --> 12:37.239
[engine starts, revs]

12:37.377 --> 12:38.550
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

12:48.250 --> 12:50.114
Thank you, Mrs. Griffin.

13:03.403 --> 13:05.163
[Nico] Spoke to my buddy
in Big Sur again.

13:05.301 --> 13:07.476
He says they haven't had
a case in six months.

13:07.614 --> 13:10.686
[young woman] If only we could get out of the city.

13:10.824 --> 13:14.069
[Nico] I'm still putting feelers out to get black-market passes.

13:14.207 --> 13:16.623
No hits yet,
but once we have those,

13:16.761 --> 13:20.075
I quarantine for three weeks and then we're gone.

13:20.213 --> 13:22.456
[young woman]
Hey, at least you got
your ride back.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.769
[Nico] More deliveries a day means more money to save.

13:24.907 --> 13:29.222
Who would have thought
Lester's Gets is actually good
at getting things?

13:29.360 --> 13:31.051
The man doesn't disappoint.

13:32.397 --> 13:38.472
Tomorrow, Nico and Cielito
will ride again.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.855
I still can't believe
you named that
sick-ass bike Cielito.

13:41.993 --> 13:43.546
I know, it's great, right?

13:43.684 --> 13:45.065
No.

13:46.411 --> 13:47.516
There she is.

13:47.654 --> 13:50.519
[young woman] Your one true love.[chuckles]

13:50.657 --> 13:52.279
[Nico] Here, check this out.

13:53.315 --> 13:56.249
Hey, your garden's not dead.

13:56.387 --> 13:58.182
Give it time.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.633
God, I swear all I do is love and nurture these things and all they do is die on me.

14:01.771 --> 14:04.360
We should take 'em with us
when we leave.

14:05.189 --> 14:06.984
Lita has green fingers.

14:07.122 --> 14:09.710
We're getting Lita
her own place, by the way.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.609
-Are we?
-Yeah.

14:11.747 --> 14:13.749
I figure we have a lot
of lost time to make up for,

14:13.887 --> 14:15.544
and we're not gonna want
a chaperone, are we?

14:15.682 --> 14:17.028
I'm telling her you said that.

14:17.166 --> 14:18.788
-Do not tell her I said that.-I am.

14:18.927 --> 14:20.135
You know I'm terrified of her.

14:20.273 --> 14:21.861
That's why I'm telling her.

14:25.830 --> 14:30.179
[sirens wailing in distance]

[bell dings]

15:11.634 --> 15:12.981
Bingo.

15:14.534 --> 15:17.951
Hey, guys. It's me, May. This is May Sings the Blues.

15:18.089 --> 15:21.437
I'm a struggling singer-songwriter who still remembers the good old days

15:21.575 --> 15:23.267
when we could still listen to music all together.

15:23.405 --> 15:25.269
So, you can make any requests

15:25.407 --> 15:27.650
and you can hit like if you like what you hear

15:27.788 --> 15:29.825
and maybe even subscribe.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.275
So, what's next?

15:31.413 --> 15:33.346
Let's lighten the mood
a little bit.

15:33.484 --> 15:38.420
[May chuckles]
Vanilla Ice? No, that's
the wrong stream, buddy.

you played a great cover
of 'American Pie' once.

15:47.877 --> 15:53.228
Your songs got me
through some rough days
when I was in the military."

16:00.821 --> 16:02.892
Well, MD...

16:03.031 --> 16:04.964
this one is for you
and the boys.

16:06.103 --> 16:10.348
âª Take a deep breath Everything will be all rightâª

some pencils for you."

17:46.686 --> 17:48.688
You stole them,
Nicholas James.

17:48.826 --> 17:50.655
How did I steal 'em?
There's nobody around.

17:50.793 --> 17:52.450
They're just sitting there, but if you don't want 'em...

17:52.588 --> 17:54.728
No, no.
Give me, give me, please.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.558

18:08.949 --> 18:12.091
Yeah, well, someday.

The way I figure, by the time I'm 87 and you're, what is it, 84,

18:17.579 --> 18:19.339
we should have enough
put away...

-Shut up.
-...to buy passes
and get out of the city.

18:21.721 --> 18:23.102

[Nico] What's up, boss?

18:35.321 --> 18:37.944
What the hell are you doing?
Don't you have
somewhere to be?

18:38.082 --> 18:40.395
Like a high-priority drop
on the west side?

I'm on it. Say hi to Sara.

Now get going.

18:55.444 --> 18:57.481
-I gotta get going.
-Yep.

18:59.483 --> 19:01.036
I'll call you tonight?

19:01.174 --> 19:03.245
I don't know.
I think I have to check
my busy schedule,

I can make it work.

It's nice to meet you.

No, I know you're May.

20:30.919 --> 20:33.646
You miss it, Dozer,
the way things were?

20:34.992 --> 20:38.685
I was on lockdown
long before
it was fashionable.

20:39.928 --> 20:41.343
How come?

20:42.896 --> 20:46.245
When I got back from the war, people didn't want to talk about it.

20:46.383 --> 20:48.143
You're a vet in a wheelchair, people are--

20:48.281 --> 20:50.697
They see you, they put
their face in their phones.

20:50.835 --> 20:52.872
They don't want
to have to face that.

20:55.495 --> 20:58.429
Somewhere down the line,
I just...

20:59.568 --> 21:01.052
stopped going out.

For how long?

[May] Wow. You're a pro at lockdowns.

21:14.411 --> 21:16.827
This must be a cakewalk
for you.

Is it as bad as it seems out there?

21:32.049 --> 21:34.293
It's worse. It's way worse.

21:34.431 --> 21:37.157
But it pays the bills.

21:38.607 --> 21:42.508
[man in film] Three thousand dollars. It might as well have been three million.

21:43.509 --> 21:45.545

I'm at the theater.

21:50.964 --> 21:53.829

have to squint a little,

21:53.967 --> 21:57.005
but, I mean, it's basically
like Mann's Chinese out here.

21:57.626 --> 22:00.215
Mmm. That was my favorite one.

22:00.353 --> 22:03.252
You know I used to
go there every Friday
for matinees, right?

22:04.392 --> 22:07.912
Do you think that
maybe we were there
for the same showings?

22:08.050 --> 22:11.985

this really hot girl that
I was too scared to talk to.

from the old office.

that place out, huh?

Oh, there's nothing left.
Everything's here.

out of my house right now.

Yeah, my mom would be proud.

the guy in front if he could
please remove his hat?

25:32.254 --> 25:33.635
Nico, please hurry.

25:37.432 --> 25:39.261
[Alice] Stop! No! Please!

25:41.194 --> 25:44.335
Somebody help me, please!
Somebody help me!

25:44.473 --> 25:45.820
Get off me!

25:53.552 --> 25:55.623
[Alice's whimpering fades]

25:55.761 --> 25:57.556
[intercom buzzing]

26:02.491 --> 26:04.597
I know you're in there.

26:09.326 --> 26:10.430
Hello.

26:10.569 --> 26:13.088
Are you Ms. Garcia?

26:14.434 --> 26:17.437
I'm terribly sorry
to inform you

26:17.576 --> 26:20.820
that there's been an outbreak of cases in this building,

26:20.958 --> 26:22.684
including your poor neighbor.

26:22.822 --> 26:24.479
Have you ever left
your apartment?

26:24.617 --> 26:27.724
Maybe a glass of wine
with Mrs. Grant?

26:27.862 --> 26:30.623
Like, a little gossip?
A little talk?

26:30.761 --> 26:32.832
Breaking the lockdown?

26:34.454 --> 26:36.387
No, we follow the rules here.

26:36.525 --> 26:40.978
You wouldn't believe
how many times
I've gotten that answer.

26:41.116 --> 26:44.741
And before you know it, I'm back at the same address.

26:44.879 --> 26:46.259
That's...[laughs]

26:46.397 --> 26:47.951
Yeah, you know, it's--

26:48.089 --> 26:54.716
Disobedience is, like,
spreading like a tornado.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.754
Well, don't forget your
TempCheck in the morning.

26:57.892 --> 27:01.447
And remember, stay safe, sane and sanitized.

27:01.585 --> 27:02.586
[clicks tongue]

27:02.724 --> 27:04.933
[breathing heavily]

27:37.552 --> 27:40.762
[Sara's grandmother coughing]

27:45.215 --> 27:47.804
No! No, you have to
stay away from me.

27:47.942 --> 27:49.875
[in Spanish]

27:51.048 --> 27:52.809
Please,
just let me help you, okay?

28:04.924 --> 28:06.995
For all we know,
it's just a cold, Lita.

28:07.651 --> 28:08.756
[in Spanish]

28:08.894 --> 28:12.138
[coughing] No, Sara,
stay away from me.

28:13.174 --> 28:15.935
[coughing]

28:20.008 --> 28:21.389
[phone rings]

28:21.527 --> 28:23.840
Hey, I just got here.
How is she?

28:24.392 --> 28:25.324
She's not good.

28:25.462 --> 28:27.015
She has a fever.

28:27.153 --> 28:28.948
Oh, shit.

28:33.884 --> 28:36.093
Temp test
is at 9:00 a.m., Nico.

28:39.338 --> 28:40.511
Okay.

28:42.099 --> 28:44.723
They'll take us both.
You know that, right?

28:46.241 --> 28:48.243
They'll take both her and me.

28:49.486 --> 28:50.521
Sara...

28:52.247 --> 28:53.041
Hey, hey.

28:53.179 --> 28:55.734
No one's taking you from me.

28:57.666 --> 28:59.461
[coughing continues]

29:00.877 --> 29:03.880
She needs me.
You should go, okay?
It's not safe here.

29:04.432 --> 29:05.398
Yeah, right.

29:09.886 --> 29:11.370
I'm not going anywhere.

29:12.612 --> 29:13.993
Thank you.

29:28.283 --> 29:30.354
-[Piper] Breaking curfew?
-Oh, Jesus.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.019
Harland needs to see me.

29:40.157 --> 29:42.194
-Oh, does he?
-[William] Yeah.

29:42.332 --> 29:43.678
Mm.

29:43.816 --> 29:47.095
He has those passes
that we need.

29:47.233 --> 29:48.441
Mm.

29:52.342 --> 29:55.034
So may I leave?

29:55.172 --> 30:00.453
You know, every time
you open that door, you risk
letting in what's out there.

30:00.591 --> 30:04.216
Yeah, I know. I also know
that it is the only way

30:04.354 --> 30:06.494
that we are keeping a roof
over our heads.

30:06.632 --> 30:09.462
Those are your words.
Not mine-- Jesus.

30:10.325 --> 30:13.466
Piper, you think
I want to go out there?

30:13.950 --> 30:15.848
I think you love it.

30:19.472 --> 30:22.924
And just because
you wear that bracelet,
doesn't make it true.

30:23.062 --> 30:29.793
So be a good boy
and burn that sleek
little outfit of yours

30:29.931 --> 30:32.589
before you come back
into the house.

30:41.874 --> 30:44.187
[gas hisses]

30:46.775 --> 30:48.087
[door shuts]

30:56.613 --> 30:57.994
[whispers] Nico?

31:00.928 --> 31:02.136
Nico?

31:03.551 --> 31:04.863
I'm here.

31:05.725 --> 31:07.417
She's sleeping.

31:09.143 --> 31:10.869
She needs to rest.

31:15.218 --> 31:17.945
It's like I can feel you
through this door.

31:25.573 --> 31:27.471
[chuckles]

31:28.576 --> 31:29.611
Hey...

31:34.030 --> 31:36.204
Do you remember
when we first met,

31:37.136 --> 31:38.862
and you were yelling at me
in Spanish?

31:39.000 --> 31:40.208
[chuckles]

31:41.002 --> 31:42.901
I have no recollection
of that.

31:43.660 --> 31:45.765
[Nico] I blame
Lester's handwriting.

31:45.904 --> 31:50.632
It said 31,
but I read it as 37,

31:50.770 --> 31:53.912
and I came pounding on
your door like a jackass.

31:57.605 --> 31:59.158
Do you ever wonder
what would've happened

31:59.296 --> 32:01.712
if you knocked
on some other girl's door?

32:03.473 --> 32:05.993
Well, I knock
on a hundred doors a day.

32:13.241 --> 32:15.554
But I've never met
anyone like you.

32:16.762 --> 32:20.248
I'm really glad
Lester messed up that address.

32:22.802 --> 32:24.321
Yeah, me too.

32:32.674 --> 32:33.848
Oh, hey, Mom.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.643
What are you
still doing awake?

32:35.781 --> 32:39.129
I heard voices. Did Dad leave?

32:39.267 --> 32:42.477
Yeah, he had to go out,
but he'll be back.

32:43.271 --> 32:46.274
He shouldn't do that.
It's not safe.

32:47.413 --> 32:49.001
I know.

32:49.139 --> 32:53.592
But sometimes
we have to do things
we don't want to survive.

32:59.356 --> 33:00.461
Mom...

33:02.532 --> 33:04.741
Do you ever wish
I was different?

33:05.984 --> 33:08.434
What? No, sweetie.

33:08.572 --> 33:10.505
What do you mean?

33:12.231 --> 33:14.475
Ellie said with you
being immune,

33:14.613 --> 33:17.202
there's a 50% chance
I would be.

33:17.340 --> 33:19.549
-[Piper] Oh, honey.
-And I'm not.

33:20.860 --> 33:23.173
Instead, I'm even weaker
than a normal person.

33:23.311 --> 33:26.073
You are not weak.

33:27.522 --> 33:30.180
But if I wasn't like this,
you could go places.

33:30.318 --> 33:32.113
You wouldn't have to
worry about me.

33:32.251 --> 33:36.600
And why would I
wanna go anywhere
if you couldn't be with me?

33:38.671 --> 33:39.707
Listen to me.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.779
You are perfect.

33:43.331 --> 33:45.437
Absolutely perfect.

33:45.575 --> 33:50.407
And I wouldn't change
one thing about you.

33:52.340 --> 33:54.480
And neither would your father.

what happens to us...

or even worse...
-You do not. I know.

41:44.294 --> 41:46.365
-...we get thrown
into the Q-zone.
-Really?

41:46.504 --> 41:48.229
And then what happens to Emma?

41:49.230 --> 41:52.579
Piper, I told the kid
to go away.

41:52.717 --> 41:54.512
What else
do you want me to do?

41:54.650 --> 41:56.237
I'd like to know
how he knows about us.

41:56.375 --> 41:58.481
Well, why don't you do it?
Why don't you find out?

41:58.619 --> 42:01.898
I'm so sick of cleaning
up your shit.

42:02.036 --> 42:04.107
-Uh, Nico?
-Mrs. Griffin?

42:04.245 --> 42:06.731
I think my husband
is just being extra cautious,

42:06.869 --> 42:08.664
but I think I can help you.

42:09.527 --> 42:10.631
Thank you, Mrs. Griffin.

42:10.769 --> 42:15.567
Hey, listen, um,
who told you about us?

42:16.326 --> 42:18.087
Nobody. Nobody told me.

42:18.225 --> 42:21.331
I had nowhere to go,
so I came here. I figured
you guys had connections.

42:23.333 --> 42:26.613
[Piper] Listen, we don't have
what you're looking for,

42:26.751 --> 42:29.995
but, um,
I know someone who does.

42:30.617 --> 42:31.894
Marie.

42:32.032 --> 42:34.172
Can I give you what I have?
It's not much.

42:38.659 --> 42:40.074
I don't need your money.

42:41.144 --> 42:44.009
[automated female voice]
UV sanitation activated.

42:44.147 --> 42:46.874
Mrs. Griffin, you have no idea how much this means.

42:47.012 --> 42:49.118
Thank you, and you're saving a life.

42:58.921 --> 43:00.578
[sanitation man]
It's not done yet.

43:00.716 --> 43:02.441
[Nico] I have a lead.
I'm on my way there now.
How's Lita?

43:02.580 --> 43:05.617
She's not good.
There's armed guards
outside my door.

43:05.755 --> 43:07.654
[automated female voice]
Do not attempt
to leave your home.

43:07.792 --> 43:09.966
[Nico] I'll call you
when I have the passes.
Just be ready, okay?

43:10.104 --> 43:11.209
Okay.

43:27.363 --> 43:28.295
Sara.

43:28.433 --> 43:29.814
[in Spanish]

43:41.998 --> 43:44.207
[sobbing chuckle]

44:19.622 --> 44:21.348
[Sara in Spanish]

44:54.899 --> 44:56.832
[machinery whirring]

44:59.904 --> 45:03.631
[man singing opera
in distance]

45:03.770 --> 45:05.047
Hello?

45:10.742 --> 45:11.674
Hello?

45:11.812 --> 45:13.883
[man] âª Mariaâª

45:14.021 --> 45:19.717
âª Mariaâª

45:19.855 --> 45:23.065
[operatic singing continues]

45:32.764 --> 45:34.939
[sighs, laughs]

45:35.077 --> 45:37.493
It's like La Scala in Milan.

45:38.736 --> 45:39.978
You see, in this country,

45:40.116 --> 45:43.395
most people think
that Puccini is a mushroom.

45:43.533 --> 45:45.397
You want a smoke?

45:45.535 --> 45:47.261
No, I don't smoke.

45:47.399 --> 45:49.574
Do you know
what I love about smoking?

45:49.712 --> 45:54.682
It's nice to know
there's something out there
that still can kill you.

45:54.821 --> 45:56.926
[chuckles]

45:59.135 --> 46:02.449
Now, a little bird
came flying,
landed on my shoulder,

46:02.587 --> 46:07.316
whispered in my ear
that you need two passes.

46:07.834 --> 46:09.352
Yeah.

46:10.353 --> 46:11.492
Follow me.

46:17.671 --> 46:23.677
Don't worry,
I'm a regular guy like you
just trying to make a living.

46:23.815 --> 46:25.472
You're a munie, right?

46:25.610 --> 46:29.200
So I assume these passes,
they're not for you?

46:29.338 --> 46:32.582
No, my girl's grandma
got sick.

46:32.720 --> 46:35.137
Let's start with the girl.
Age?

46:35.275 --> 46:36.724
Twenty-six.

46:36.863 --> 46:39.417
Her full name and social,
please?

46:43.801 --> 46:45.181
I need a name...

46:46.148 --> 46:48.253
because I have to program
these passes.

46:48.391 --> 46:49.461
You with me?

46:50.946 --> 46:52.464
Sara.

46:53.120 --> 46:55.398
I need her full name.

46:56.848 --> 46:59.264
I get it.
You gotta be cautious
and you gotta be smart,

46:59.402 --> 47:01.404
especially these days,
you know.

47:01.542 --> 47:04.545
I didn't set up this meeting.
You did.

47:05.512 --> 47:08.101
And I'm here
wasting my goddamn time.

47:08.239 --> 47:09.999
If you don't trust me, leave.

47:10.793 --> 47:12.070
No.

47:12.760 --> 47:13.692
I'm good.

47:13.831 --> 47:15.384
You good?

47:16.488 --> 47:22.494
You know, we're kinda lucky
because we're two munies.

47:22.978 --> 47:24.324
I give you my word.

47:24.462 --> 47:27.741
And I would like
to back it up...

47:27.879 --> 47:29.156
the old-fashioned way.

47:32.884 --> 47:34.472
What do you say?

47:39.132 --> 47:40.167
[chuckles] Good.

47:40.305 --> 47:41.824
Feels good, doesn't it?

47:41.962 --> 47:44.102
It's like a childhood memory.

47:44.827 --> 47:47.554
A bite out of
grandma's cookies.

47:48.348 --> 47:50.177
So I need the name
of the girl,

47:50.315 --> 47:54.112
and I need the name
of whoever knows
about this meeting.

47:54.250 --> 47:55.907
Do you understand?

47:57.219 --> 48:00.947
And I can stick as many holes
in you as I like.

48:01.085 --> 48:03.156
-[Harland shouts]
-[Nico grunts]

48:06.711 --> 48:09.887
[Harland] Come on. Just go in!

48:15.409 --> 48:17.618
[panting]

48:28.802 --> 48:31.218
[gunshots ricocheting]

49:01.869 --> 49:03.630
[sanitation man]
Get on the ground!

49:08.876 --> 49:10.395
Come on!

49:17.644 --> 49:19.197
-What's your name, soldier?
-Nico.

49:19.335 --> 49:21.579
-Nico, Boomer.
-Why are you even helping me?

49:21.717 --> 49:24.237
They drag and pull schmucks
like you down here
to their death.

49:24.375 --> 49:26.446
Today, I'm drawing a line
in the sand.

49:27.274 --> 49:29.311
I like you, bro.

49:29.449 --> 49:31.761
One dead body down here
stinks up the whole building.

49:31.899 --> 49:34.592
Once you get that smell
in your nostrils, it lingers.

49:34.730 --> 49:35.869
You can't blow it out.

49:36.007 --> 49:38.044
Tired of it, man. No more.

49:38.182 --> 49:40.080
-[sanitation man] Over here!
-Shit!

50:18.946 --> 50:19.878
What are you doing?

50:20.017 --> 50:21.639
I'm staying.

50:21.777 --> 50:24.642
Head downstairs.
That'll get you back
to the elevators.

50:27.334 --> 50:29.716
Stay safe, pilgrim.
I'm rooting for ya.

50:30.199 --> 50:32.270
Come on!

50:39.036 --> 50:40.761
Oh, jeez.

50:41.348 --> 50:43.316
How hard can it be, guys?

50:46.698 --> 50:48.976
Hey!

50:49.115 --> 50:50.771
[dogs howling]

50:50.909 --> 50:53.084
[ringtone: Lester's voice] Answer the phone. Answer the phone.

50:53.222 --> 50:54.844
Answer the phone.
Answer the phone.

50:54.982 --> 50:56.225
-[beeps]
-Lester's Gets.

50:56.363 --> 50:59.297
-Distribution--
-Cut the crap. Where is he?

50:59.435 --> 51:00.919
Who are we talking about now?

51:01.058 --> 51:02.921
Your courier, Nico.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.751
He showed up here at my house

51:04.889 --> 51:07.719
and he accused me of
selling black-market passes.

51:08.651 --> 51:10.653
[sighs] Well,
he's not working today.

51:10.791 --> 51:13.104
Don't bullshit me, Lester.
I know you sit there

51:13.242 --> 51:15.900
and watch your guys
drive around all day
like rats in a maze.

51:16.038 --> 51:19.800
Just give me his GPS
or I'm gonna take
my business elsewhere.

51:23.114 --> 51:26.393
He-- Looks like
he disabled his GPS.

51:26.531 --> 51:28.740
I'll let you know
if he comes back online.

51:29.258 --> 51:30.708
Yeah, you do that.

51:32.606 --> 51:33.400
So?

51:33.538 --> 51:35.747
He slipped the leash.

51:35.885 --> 51:38.302
What do we pay Harland for?

51:38.440 --> 51:40.373
He better get this contained.

51:40.511 --> 51:41.546
Yeah.

51:42.927 --> 51:45.861
[May] So, it was pre-pandemic, and I met this record exec online,

51:45.999 --> 51:49.209
and he saw
one of my YouTube videos,
and he invited me out here,

51:49.347 --> 51:51.315
and he told me that I was gonna be a big star,

51:51.453 --> 51:55.905
and then all the shit hit,
and I got trapped here.

51:56.043 --> 51:59.875
And the record deal that never existed now was gone.

52:00.013 --> 52:01.187
It was never gonna happen.

52:01.325 --> 52:03.706
He keeps doing
this weird dance with me

52:03.844 --> 52:05.846
like somehow
things are gonna be different,

52:05.984 --> 52:09.471
or somehow things
are gonna be the way
that they were, but the--

52:09.609 --> 52:12.681
You know that nothing is ever gonna be the same.

52:14.061 --> 52:15.753
And I'm lonely, you know?

52:17.824 --> 52:18.825
[exhales]

52:18.963 --> 52:21.414
Well, this is nice
and light conversation.

52:21.552 --> 52:23.726
-You know what I mean?
-[laughs, sniffles]

52:23.864 --> 52:26.522
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

52:30.871 --> 52:32.252
What's the matter?

52:32.390 --> 52:34.668
-Are you okay?
What's going on?
-Nothing.

52:41.848 --> 52:43.090
Is it that guy?

52:43.229 --> 52:45.058
The suit
you were telling me about?

52:45.196 --> 52:47.923
You gonna save me, Dozer?

52:48.061 --> 52:50.995
I don't know if you're kidding
or not. Do you need saving?

52:51.133 --> 52:54.550
-'Cause I'll come over there. -No, it's okay.

52:55.275 --> 52:57.346
If you got it, you got it.

52:57.967 --> 53:00.763
No, I'm gonna handle it.

53:02.006 --> 53:04.698
-Are you sure?
-I'm gonna handle it.

53:09.220 --> 53:11.326
-[breathing heavily]
-[line ringing]

53:14.156 --> 53:15.640
Hey.

53:16.848 --> 53:18.195
Hi.

53:20.473 --> 53:21.922
What is it?

53:24.339 --> 53:25.719
She's gone.

53:32.347 --> 53:34.625
Please tell me
you have the passes.

53:40.424 --> 53:41.804
I don't.

53:43.392 --> 53:44.945
I don't have the passes.

53:55.128 --> 53:56.267
It's okay.

53:57.164 --> 53:58.752
Now I know
where I can get some.

53:58.890 --> 54:02.066
But when they come,
you have to hide.

54:02.204 --> 54:03.585
Okay?
You cannot let them find you.

54:03.723 --> 54:06.381
You do whatever you
have to do, but just don't--

54:06.519 --> 54:08.797
I need you
to buy me a little time.

54:08.935 --> 54:10.592
Okay.

54:11.317 --> 54:12.732
I'm sorry.

54:15.528 --> 54:17.323
I love you.

54:20.084 --> 54:21.637
I love you too.

54:38.205 --> 54:40.553
[automated female voice]
Curfew is now in effect.

54:40.691 --> 54:43.314
Daytime essential workers must now return home.

54:45.040 --> 54:49.596
Curfew is now in effect.
All essential workers
must now return home.

55:11.446 --> 55:14.000
Hey,
I need to see you tonight.

55:15.381 --> 55:17.728
No, we--
We're done, okay?

55:17.866 --> 55:20.765
What, are you playing
hard to get?
You're driving me crazy.

55:20.903 --> 55:22.595
Just-- please just let me
come over.

55:22.733 --> 55:25.977
We don't have to do anything.
I just-- I need to talk.

55:26.115 --> 55:27.876
There's nothing to talk about.

55:29.222 --> 55:33.985
And whatever this
arrangement is, it's over.

55:34.123 --> 55:36.367
May, come on, don't do this.

55:36.505 --> 55:37.989
I have tapes.

55:38.127 --> 55:41.924
I have tapes of you promising
black-market immunity passes.

55:42.822 --> 55:44.548
[William]
You were recording me?

55:44.686 --> 55:47.723
It was just a little
life insurance policy.

55:49.415 --> 55:51.002
You're dumping me
on the phone!

55:51.140 --> 55:53.108
William, leave me alone!

55:54.489 --> 55:56.042
Or it all goes viral.

55:57.112 --> 55:58.665
Okay?

55:59.597 --> 56:02.773
-[call disconnects]
-[sniffles, sighs]

56:05.051 --> 56:06.742
Bitch.

56:13.611 --> 56:15.268
What the hell?

56:15.406 --> 56:17.132
Going out again?

56:19.272 --> 56:20.825
What are you doing?

56:21.826 --> 56:23.932
I know about your girlfriend.

56:24.070 --> 56:25.796
So what?

56:25.934 --> 56:30.456
Oh, no, you think I care
that you're screwing someone?

56:30.594 --> 56:35.530
No, no. This is about Emma,
our daughter.

56:35.668 --> 56:38.118
What chance does she have
if she gets this thing?

56:38.256 --> 56:42.053
I don't know, Piper.
What chance do any of us
have if we get this thing?

56:42.191 --> 56:43.917
I want you out.

56:44.055 --> 56:45.747
Give me the gun.

56:45.885 --> 56:47.749
Piper,
I don't have time for this.

56:47.887 --> 56:50.510
You let her tape you?
You dumb prick.

56:50.648 --> 56:53.548
Give me the gun,
let me clean up my mess.

56:53.686 --> 56:56.482
You want me to clean it up?
Give me the gun.

56:58.173 --> 56:59.519
I want you out.

56:59.657 --> 57:02.108
What are you gonna do?
You gonna shoot me?

57:02.246 --> 57:04.041
Get out!

57:06.457 --> 57:07.907
[softly] Get out.

57:14.776 --> 57:18.124
[door opens, slams]

57:37.246 --> 57:39.007
-[grunts]
-[gate rattles]

57:56.576 --> 57:58.647
[phone ringing]

58:07.000 --> 58:07.967
Hello.

58:08.105 --> 58:10.072
[Piper] This is Piper Griffin.

58:10.694 --> 58:13.179
I believe you know my husband.

58:15.699 --> 58:18.702
I think we might be able
to help one another.

58:21.636 --> 58:23.810
William's on his way
over to you.

58:23.948 --> 58:27.504
I suggest that you
not be there when he arrives.

58:30.714 --> 58:32.094
Thank you.

58:50.734 --> 58:51.907
No.

58:52.425 --> 58:54.910
No, no, Nico!

59:11.375 --> 59:12.928
[ringing]

59:15.413 --> 59:16.656
Hello.

59:16.794 --> 59:19.590
Hi, uh, this is Lester
from Lester's Gets.

59:19.728 --> 59:21.316
We're one big happy family.

59:21.454 --> 59:22.835
Yeah, I know who you are.

59:22.973 --> 59:25.976
It's Piper.
What can I do for you?

59:26.114 --> 59:30.774
Yes, your husband called me
earlier today looking
for one of my couriers.

59:31.395 --> 59:32.741
Yes, have you found him?

59:32.879 --> 59:35.295
Yeah, I think so.

59:35.433 --> 59:37.125
The thing is...

59:37.263 --> 59:39.334
I think he's...

59:39.472 --> 59:41.163
inside your house.

59:50.310 --> 59:52.209
[automated female voice]
Stay in your homes.

Help us to protect you. Please remain in your homes.

1:00:40.740 --> 1:00:42.362
I need you to get up
and get in the bathroom.

1:00:42.500 --> 1:00:44.675
-What's happening?
-Come on, honey.

1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:48.714
Shh...

1:00:51.717 --> 1:00:53.166
Put this on.

Now where is that girl?

You think you can hide?
I'll find you.

1:01:17.604 --> 1:01:20.366
Bingo! Found Grandma!

Bag and tag the hag!

1:01:23.541 --> 1:01:24.991
Hey, where are you?

1:01:27.476 --> 1:01:30.687
Where the hell
is that little duckling?

My kingdom for a beer.

1:01:49.291 --> 1:01:50.430
Nothing.

1:01:51.224 --> 1:01:52.398
Oh, shi--

Roses are red...

1:01:59.923 --> 1:02:01.165
violets are blue...

1:02:03.754 --> 1:02:05.756
you think you can hide...

1:02:06.999 --> 1:02:08.345
but I'll find you.

[man] Hey!

1:02:55.357 --> 1:02:56.945
Hey, give me a hand with this!

1:02:57.083 --> 1:02:58.153
Are you okay, Bobby?

1:02:58.291 --> 1:03:00.017
[heavy breathing continues]

1:03:03.641 --> 1:03:05.264
Then get her outta here.

1:03:11.097 --> 1:03:13.893
[sanitation man on radio] We have one deceased, one in the wind. Over.

[gun cocks]

1:03:27.769 --> 1:03:30.427
How dare you
come into my house.

1:03:31.566 --> 1:03:33.292
I'm not here to hurt anyone.

1:03:34.155 --> 1:03:36.157
You've already
put my daughter's life at risk

1:03:36.295 --> 1:03:38.366
just by stepping foot in here.

1:03:38.504 --> 1:03:42.370
I came to you for help,
and you tried
to have me killed.

1:03:42.508 --> 1:03:44.821
Look,
I just needed information

1:03:44.959 --> 1:03:49.101
because I can't allow anyone
to know what we're doing here.

1:03:49.239 --> 1:03:52.621
Nobody knows, and no one will.

1:03:52.759 --> 1:03:55.866
Mrs. Griffin, I understand
you're just trying
to protect your daughter.

1:03:56.004 --> 1:03:57.937
I get that.

1:03:58.075 --> 1:04:02.114
Because I'm trying to save
the one person left in my life
that matters to me.

1:04:09.190 --> 1:04:11.468
I can't leave here
without that pass.

1:04:16.335 --> 1:04:17.439
Please.

Please help me.

Come on, get it down.

1:04:33.904 --> 1:04:35.250
Open it up.

1:04:36.562 --> 1:04:39.703
You better not
make me regret this.

1:04:39.841 --> 1:04:43.189
[automated female voice]
This building
has been condemned.

1:04:43.327 --> 1:04:45.640
The safest place
is your own home.

[Piper]
What's her name?

1:05:00.862 --> 1:05:03.002
I assume it's a girl.

1:05:03.865 --> 1:05:05.591
Sara Mia Garcia.

1:05:09.043 --> 1:05:10.423
Now what?

1:05:10.561 --> 1:05:12.011
Now we wait.

Stay in your homes.
We are here to help.

1:05:34.275 --> 1:05:39.556
If you believe your neighbor is defying mandatory lockdown, give us a call.

1:05:44.906 --> 1:05:46.701
Do you know
where you're gonna go?

1:05:48.220 --> 1:05:49.807
Far away from here.

1:05:50.947 --> 1:05:54.260
We're all just trying to
protect the ones we love.

[computer chimes]

1:06:05.685 --> 1:06:07.549
Thank you.

1:06:09.206 --> 1:06:10.414
Take care.

1:06:19.837 --> 1:06:21.563
Oh, shit.

1:06:21.701 --> 1:06:24.221
Hey, guys! Hold off!

1:06:24.359 --> 1:06:25.636
Stop!

1:06:25.774 --> 1:06:28.260
Okay, call them to stop.
Call them to stop!

1:06:28.398 --> 1:06:30.227
The girl is in a hazmat suit.

1:06:30.365 --> 1:06:33.161
[sanitation man]
Secure all personnel,
girl is in disguise. Over.

Yeah. Yeah.

1:06:56.736 --> 1:06:58.393
[line ringing]

1:06:58.531 --> 1:07:01.293
Hey, are you sure
it's okay if I come?

1:07:02.087 --> 1:07:04.813
No, it's fine.
Of course. Of course.

1:07:04.951 --> 1:07:07.816
-I'll see you soon. -Be safe getting over here.

Okay.

Oh, shit.

Goddamn it.

1:07:55.795 --> 1:07:57.659
Get out of the car, May.

You wanna play?

1:08:00.041 --> 1:08:03.009
-Please leave me alone!
-What? You wanna play?
Let's play!

1:08:03.148 --> 1:08:05.564
Let's play! Get out!

1:08:07.807 --> 1:08:10.293
Get out of the car
or I'll kill you.

1:08:10.431 --> 1:08:12.398
Did you think
you were just gonna leave me?

1:08:12.536 --> 1:08:15.815
I'll drag you out
by your neck.
Get out! Get out!

You don't get it, do you?

1:09:23.331 --> 1:09:24.953
[laughs]

1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:27.542
You're not stupid.

1:09:29.130 --> 1:09:31.408
No symptoms...

1:09:31.546 --> 1:09:36.448
after being locked up
with your infectious grandma.

1:09:37.932 --> 1:09:41.970
You'd be coughing up
your lungs right now,

1:09:42.108 --> 1:09:44.973
and that makes you immune.

1:09:47.804 --> 1:09:49.737
If that's true,
then let me go.

1:09:50.703 --> 1:09:52.464
I'm so sorry.

1:09:53.948 --> 1:09:55.674
That's not how it works.

1:09:55.812 --> 1:09:57.331
Take her.

1:10:08.065 --> 1:10:08.997
Sara!

1:10:09.135 --> 1:10:10.344
Sara!

1:10:36.370 --> 1:10:38.820
Well, she really captured
your likeness.

1:10:38.958 --> 1:10:40.512
Talented girl.

1:10:42.376 --> 1:10:43.687
Who are you?

1:10:44.516 --> 1:10:47.967
Before this shit started
to hit the fan,

1:10:48.105 --> 1:10:53.318
I used to drive garbage trucks
for the Department
of Sanitation.

1:10:54.250 --> 1:10:58.012
Then all of a sudden,
my superiors...

1:10:58.150 --> 1:11:00.083
they started to die off.

1:11:00.221 --> 1:11:01.981
[chuckles]

1:11:02.119 --> 1:11:03.673
And then one day,

1:11:03.811 --> 1:11:08.505
I was running
the whole damn department.

1:11:08.643 --> 1:11:11.301
[laughs] I did it. Four aces.

1:11:11.439 --> 1:11:13.855
It's called the Idiot. Look.

1:11:14.787 --> 1:11:16.996
Happens once in a lifetime.

1:11:17.134 --> 1:11:21.691
Emmett D. Harland,
once a lowly refuse collector,

1:11:21.829 --> 1:11:26.212
is now the thin blue line
between death...

1:11:26.351 --> 1:11:30.216
[chuckles]
and a miserable existence.

1:11:30.355 --> 1:11:32.771
Hey, uh, what about yourself?

1:11:33.496 --> 1:11:35.567
What did you do
before the fall?

1:11:36.982 --> 1:11:38.604
I was a paralegal.

1:11:39.778 --> 1:11:41.814
I was putting myself
through law school.

1:11:42.677 --> 1:11:43.851
Oh.

1:11:43.989 --> 1:11:46.612
Well, I guess it didn't
work out for everybody.

1:11:47.648 --> 1:11:49.753
That's your problem, Nico.

1:11:50.616 --> 1:11:54.551
You don't seem
to understand how good...

1:11:54.689 --> 1:11:57.658
us munies have it, huh?

1:11:57.796 --> 1:12:03.733
Only a handful of us,
like you and me, we're allowed
to roam around as we like.

1:12:03.871 --> 1:12:08.013
You want a new car?
Just go to the dealership
and drive it off.

1:12:08.151 --> 1:12:12.086
Go into a house
up in the hills
and just take over.

1:12:12.604 --> 1:12:14.951
We're untouchable.

1:12:15.469 --> 1:12:17.885
You see, munies...

1:12:18.575 --> 1:12:21.509
we're not human anymore.

1:12:22.441 --> 1:12:25.341
[chuckles] We're gods.

1:12:25.479 --> 1:12:28.930
And how do you use
your godly power? Huh?

1:12:30.069 --> 1:12:31.381
You run around

1:12:31.519 --> 1:12:37.111
and you try to save
some specimen
that is bound to die.

1:12:37.836 --> 1:12:39.355
I mean, what's wrong with you?

1:12:39.493 --> 1:12:42.806
You could have
the whole fucking world.

1:12:44.118 --> 1:12:45.084
Where's Sara?

1:12:45.222 --> 1:12:47.742
Oh, Sara? I don't know.

1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:51.746
She's halfway
to the Q-zone by now, I guess.

1:12:52.264 --> 1:12:53.610
I'm sorry.

1:12:54.266 --> 1:12:55.405
You won't be joining her.

1:13:04.103 --> 1:13:07.037
It's nice to know there's
something still out there
that can kill you.

1:13:07.175 --> 1:13:08.556
[Harland coughs]

1:13:09.868 --> 1:13:11.628
[groans]

1:13:32.373 --> 1:13:34.962
[recorded ringtone]
Answer the phone.
Answer the phone.

1:13:35.100 --> 1:13:36.550
-Answer the--
-Nico?

1:13:36.688 --> 1:13:37.999
I got something
I gotta tell you.

1:13:38.137 --> 1:13:39.725
Yeah, you told the Griffins
I was at their house.

1:13:39.863 --> 1:13:42.418
-Fair to say you owe me one?-I'm sorry, man.

1:13:42.556 --> 1:13:45.800
There's a sanitation transport
headed for the Q-zone.
I need to find it.

1:13:45.938 --> 1:13:47.561
That ain't gonna be easy.

1:13:47.699 --> 1:13:51.047
I have an ID, 0715-GLS.

1:13:54.430 --> 1:13:56.984
[Lester] I think I might know someone who can help.

1:14:05.441 --> 1:14:06.821
[line rings]

1:14:12.378 --> 1:14:15.899
I've already mapped out
every route from
Sara's place to the zone.

1:14:16.521 --> 1:14:18.212
We gotta search grid by grid.

1:14:18.350 --> 1:14:19.593
Copy that.

1:14:28.947 --> 1:14:30.189
[beeping]

1:14:33.089 --> 1:14:36.057
Keep heading southeast.
We're not seeing
anything behind you.

1:14:50.278 --> 1:14:51.970
H-Hold up! Hold up!

1:14:54.455 --> 1:14:56.802
Yup, 0715-GLS.

1:14:56.940 --> 1:15:01.013
The truck is headed
south on Western.
I repeat, south on Western.

1:15:04.603 --> 1:15:07.710
[Dozer]
We have visual confirmation.
Target is heading...

1:15:08.469 --> 1:15:10.367
Heading east on 8th.
We got 'em.

1:15:10.506 --> 1:15:11.783
Nico! We found her.

1:15:11.921 --> 1:15:14.302
She's headed east on 8th,
just past Western.

1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:16.477
They're almost at the zone, so you better book.

1:15:16.615 --> 1:15:18.617
[Nico] I copy that.

1:15:18.755 --> 1:15:21.068
[Lester] You're not gonna make it, man. Hurry up!

1:15:25.555 --> 1:15:27.799
[woman, through PA]
You have arrived
at Q-zone Alpha.

And in a stunning revelation,

1:19:56.792 --> 1:20:00.312
Griffin's own wife and a popular online streamer who had evidence of the crimes

1:20:00.450 --> 1:20:03.350
worked together to expose the conspiracy.
