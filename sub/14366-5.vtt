00:12.790 --> 00:15.725
Prime, what we have
here is an experimental

00:15.727 --> 00:18.728
<i>all-terrain expeditionary
fighting vehicle,</i>

00:18.730 --> 00:21.965
<i>designed by the finest engineers
in our M.A.S.K. division.</i>

00:24.101 --> 00:28.905
Thank you, Agent Fowler.
This will most certainly do.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.916

01:33.584 --> 01:37.724
Return trajectory fluctuations
have been stabilized.

01:37.724 --> 01:40.294
Ultra Magnus, we are
ready to receive you.

01:54.755 --> 01:58.855
We didn't find much else in
the rubble of the former base.

01:58.855 --> 02:02.525
You call this...
"not much else?"

02:06.295 --> 02:09.935
Wheeljack!
You could've caused serious damage.

02:09.935 --> 02:11.905
To me!

02:15.605 --> 02:17.005
What in the Sam hill?

02:21.986 --> 02:24.386
<i>A little help here?</i>

02:24.386 --> 02:26.956
What were you thinking, soldier?

02:26.956 --> 02:30.556
I was thinking Bulk
would catch that lob.

02:30.566 --> 02:32.796
Allow me to make myself clear.

02:32.796 --> 02:35.536
As Optimus Prime's
second-in-command,

02:35.536 --> 02:38.666
I have no intention of
tolerating Wrecker behavior.

02:38.666 --> 02:42.394
Some things never change.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.717
Jackie...

02:48.417 --> 02:50.857
Need I remind you that it
was Optimus Prime himself

02:50.857 --> 02:53.727
who assigned me to command
your Wreckers back on Cybertron

02:53.727 --> 02:56.597
and get you loose cannons under control?

02:56.597 --> 03:00.327
<i>An effective combat unit
begins with discipline.</i>

03:00.337 --> 03:01.827
If you won't accept that,

03:01.837 --> 03:04.697
feel free to choose the
path of least resistance...

03:04.707 --> 03:06.467
As you did before.

03:09.218 --> 03:14.248
If my ship weren't a twisted wreck
at present, I'd do that... sir.

03:23.428 --> 03:26.368
So, any word from Optimus?

03:26.368 --> 03:33.109
He's investigating recent Decepticon
activity, hopefully an Energon mine.

04:14.260 --> 04:17.860
How rad would it be if you
all had jetpacks like Optimus?

04:18.950 --> 04:20.870
Quite rad, Miko.

04:20.870 --> 04:25.411
But the Forge has been depleted
of its power to do that.

04:25.411 --> 04:28.521
Now it's only good
for pounding out dings.

04:35.461 --> 04:37.291
Smokescreen?

04:39.161 --> 04:41.261
Aw, what gave me away?

04:43.231 --> 04:46.231
Come on, "robots in disguise," right?

04:48.742 --> 04:53.052
- Where have you been, soldier?
- Scanning new war paint.

04:53.052 --> 04:55.752
Thought it'd be proactive
to follow Optimus' lead...

04:55.752 --> 04:57.222
and Bumblebee's.

04:59.092 --> 05:03.262
Now you can look your best
while stacking those empty cubes.

05:03.262 --> 05:06.132
Yes, sir.

05:06.132 --> 05:09.432
I was nearly a Prime,
but somehow I'm still a rookie.

05:11.032 --> 05:12.613
What was that about a "Prime?"

05:12.613 --> 05:18.553
Uh... no, time.
Time to stop acting like a rookie.

05:23.453 --> 05:26.153
Smokescreen was the
only one who went back.

05:26.153 --> 05:30.993
If it weren't for him,
Optimus might not be with us today.

05:30.993 --> 05:33.763
Arcee, we were under
the strictest of orders.

05:33.763 --> 05:36.983
The three of you had your
human partners to protect.

05:36.983 --> 05:40.144
But we are fortunate that Smokescreen

05:40.144 --> 05:44.714
is inexperienced enough not
to have followed protocol.

05:49.654 --> 05:52.354
There. I can see it.

05:55.964 --> 05:58.194
<i>Abandon the excavation.</i>

06:01.004 --> 06:02.355
<i>Now.</i>

06:06.075 --> 06:08.045
Attack!

07:00.447 --> 07:03.087
Optimus, did you find Energon?

07:03.087 --> 07:06.987
No.
But I did uncover this.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.527
It cannot be.

07:14.967 --> 07:16.167
Be what?

07:16.167 --> 07:21.378
The ancient remains...
of a Predacon.

07:28.683 --> 07:31.661
<i>Though it remains
unclear why such a skull </i>

07:31.661 --> 07:33.358
<i>would be found on your planet,</i>

07:33.358 --> 07:36.778
its presence reveals all
too much about the Predacon

07:36.778 --> 07:39.888
which Megatron recently
sent in pursuit of us.

07:39.926 --> 07:42.569
You mean that dragon bot we put on ice?

07:42.569 --> 07:48.179
Except that Predacons have
been extinct since, well...

07:48.179 --> 07:51.579
Since before most life
began on Cybertron.

07:51.579 --> 07:54.799
- They're like Earth's dinosaurs.
- Which means, for you guys,

07:54.813 --> 07:58.319
running into one would be
like us meeting a T-Rex.

07:58.319 --> 08:02.259
- So then what were dinobots?
- Totally different.

08:02.259 --> 08:06.220
With Megatron's seeming new interest
in the excavation of prehistoric

08:06.220 --> 08:11.870
skeletons and a certain scientist
back among the Decepticon ranks...

08:11.880 --> 08:14.240
It would stand to reason

08:14.250 --> 08:18.710
that Shockwave cloned the
beast from one such find.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.850
And now Megatron's
looking to clone another.

08:21.850 --> 08:26.660
What makes you think buckethead
would stop at just one?

08:26.660 --> 08:29.290
We could have beast wars on our hands.

08:29.290 --> 08:33.241
And if Shockwave only
requires a single strand of CNA

08:33.241 --> 08:36.010
from which to clone a beast...

08:36.010 --> 08:40.881
He already possesses what he
needs to engender this one.

08:40.881 --> 08:45.581
Autobots, we must become Beast Hunters.

08:45.581 --> 08:50.591
One thing still doesn't follow.
Predacons went extinct on Cybertron.

08:50.591 --> 08:53.921
So what would their bones be doing here?

08:53.931 --> 08:55.691
<i>On Earth?</i>

08:58.672 --> 09:02.742
I mean, isn't it just
a little preposterous?

09:02.742 --> 09:06.142
They are not the remains
of Predacons, Starscream.

09:06.142 --> 09:12.622
But, rather, the remains of
Predacon clones. For you see...

09:12.622 --> 09:16.722
<i>Our recent Autobot hunter
wasn't the first bestial super-soldier</i>

09:16.722 --> 09:20.592
<i>Shockwave ever attempted to breed
from prehistoric matter.</i>

09:20.592 --> 09:23.933
<i>During the war for Cybertron,</i>

09:23.943 --> 09:27.143
<i>I sanctioned the
dispatch of a small army</i>

09:27.143 --> 09:31.443
<i>of these preda-clones to
Earth to unleash the beasts</i>

09:31.443 --> 09:35.043
<i>on unwitting Autobot
forces stationed here.</i>

09:35.053 --> 09:37.883
<i>Once they accomplished their mission,</i>

09:37.883 --> 09:40.053
<i>the surviving Predacons held sentinel</i>

09:40.053 --> 09:45.563
<i>on this very world for ages to come,
guarding the Energon reserves</i>

09:45.563 --> 09:50.134
<i>they had managed to secure
while awaiting my arrival.</i>

09:50.144 --> 09:53.544
Of course, our reunion
here was much delayed,

09:53.544 --> 09:58.814
and it would seem we lost the beasts
to the ravages of time.

09:58.814 --> 10:01.114
But not their endo-matter,

10:01.114 --> 10:05.854
from which I am logically
able to extract their very CNA.

10:05.854 --> 10:11.765
Pff. Another scavenger hunt?
How logical would it really be

10:11.765 --> 10:16.905
to locate all the dusty
remains of your former pets?

10:16.905 --> 10:20.445
You are not suggesting that
I would send my creations

10:20.445 --> 10:24.845
to a distant planet without first
having them... micro-chipped?

10:24.845 --> 10:28.385
Well... well, I was.

10:28.385 --> 10:30.785
But, seriously, you did?

10:36.794 --> 10:39.336
...from our historical texts.

10:39.336 --> 10:41.806
But those are metal
versions of creatures

10:41.806 --> 10:44.436
from our Greek mythology
and medieval literature.

10:44.446 --> 10:46.006
Not dinosaurs.

10:46.006 --> 10:49.226
It would stand to
reason that Predacons did

10:49.226 --> 10:52.446
indeed walk upon this
Earth in ancient times,

10:52.446 --> 10:56.816
as they seem to have been the basis
for much of humankind's folklore.

10:56.826 --> 11:00.656
Illustrating once again that the pasts

11:00.656 --> 11:04.437
of Earth and Cybertron
are inextricably linked.

11:17.347 --> 11:20.747
- Synthetic Energon?
- Indeed.

11:20.757 --> 11:22.917
I am concerned that without access

11:22.917 --> 11:26.051
to any Energon reserves
since our base was destroyed,

11:26.051 --> 11:30.338
Our ability to deal with impending
crises will be severely hampered.

11:30.338 --> 11:34.938
- A wise decision, old friend.
- Just, please...

11:34.938 --> 11:37.578
manage your expectations.

11:37.578 --> 11:39.878
I am working with even
more rudimentary hardware

11:39.878 --> 11:41.978
- than before.
- Prime!

11:41.978 --> 11:45.618
Satellite surveillance has picked
up two signs of Decepticon activity:

11:45.618 --> 11:47.788
one near an oil field
outside of El Paso,

11:47.788 --> 11:51.436
<i>the other near the
Hebrides bluffs in Scotland.</i>

11:51.436 --> 11:53.769
So don't forget to pack your kilts.

11:53.769 --> 11:56.499
We must divide our resources.

11:56.499 --> 12:00.469
Ultra Magnus, lead the
Wreckers to the bluffs.

12:00.479 --> 12:01.809
Yes, Optimus.

12:04.009 --> 12:06.309
Uh...

12:06.309 --> 12:07.609
What's a kilt?

12:09.779 --> 12:13.249
Agent Fowler can, at times, be oblique.

12:13.259 --> 12:16.852
I find it best to
simply nod and mobilize.

12:16.852 --> 12:20.370
Bulkhead, Wheeljack, let's roll.

12:23.870 --> 12:28.580
Optimus, I know there are many
emotions tied to the Forge.

12:28.580 --> 12:31.840
This is no time to stand on ceremony.

12:37.550 --> 12:41.717
I would be honored to put
this to some practical use.

12:55.881 --> 12:57.941
I will search this quadrant.

13:43.803 --> 13:48.213
Hey 'Bee, have you ever thought
you might wanna be a Prime?

13:51.383 --> 13:53.883
Not now. Someday.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.834
"Warrior."
Yeah, you and me both.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.604
But I've seen you in action,

14:02.604 --> 14:05.174
Optimus knows you can
scrap with the best of 'em.

14:05.174 --> 14:07.404
Why won't he just promote
you from scout already?

14:10.644 --> 14:15.444
Your choice?
Hmm. So, why wait?

14:22.695 --> 14:26.795
Guess it would be more meaningful
to graduate back home on Cybertron.

14:26.805 --> 14:31.465
You're one patient guy.
I should take a cue.

15:53.828 --> 15:56.798
Like I said, you got
nice chops for a scout.

16:32.562 --> 16:34.232
How epic was that?

17:15.979 --> 17:19.541
<i>Whoo!
And that's why he's a Prime!</i>

17:30.152 --> 17:31.982
<i>Soundwave.</i>

18:26.424 --> 18:27.954
Enough.

20:10.118 --> 20:11.783
No!

20:12.939 --> 20:15.469
We have all that we need.

20:36.225 --> 20:38.970
"A single strand of CNA..."

20:47.780 --> 20:50.080
<i>Shockwave.</i>

20:51.080 --> 20:55.690
I understand that you engaged
Optimus Prime in the field.

20:55.690 --> 20:59.320
Only in order to secure
the specimen, lord Megatron.

20:59.320 --> 21:05.301
I believed that you had perished
once, my most prized engineer,

21:05.301 --> 21:11.241
and I highly doubt that project
Predacon can be completed without you.

21:11.241 --> 21:14.681
I shall leave the fetching
of bones to Starscream,

21:14.681 --> 21:19.051
and confine myself to my laboratory
in order to accelerate results.

21:19.051 --> 21:23.273
Excellent...
for I am rather impatient

21:23.282 --> 21:30.202
to witness my army of beasts
trample humankind underfoot.
