WEBVTT

00:06.880 --> 00:10.760
I blew off roll call 'cause I got that
itch, man. It's hot up here.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.428
Yo, dawg, I'm feeling this spot.

00:13.096 --> 00:16.141
-Yeah, why's that?
-Man, I just... I can smell it.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.517
We about to get that work.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.521
Look at this cat right here.

00:23.898 --> 00:26.526
See that?
That right there is a drug deal.

00:26.608 --> 00:28.778
It's 11:30 in the morning, man.
How the fuck do you get that?

00:28.861 --> 00:30.030
Come on, man.

00:30.112 --> 00:32.657
Fucking make of car.
The backpack he's wearing.

00:32.739 --> 00:34.743
In Baltimore, it's all the PC we need.

00:35.576 --> 00:37.661
Hey, Sean, I like these two cats
in the black Acura.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.247
Let's jack these fools.

00:39.329 --> 00:40.706
Let's light them up.

00:51.550 --> 00:53.094
-Show me hands!
-Hands! Hands!

00:53.428 --> 00:55.180
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

00:57.974 --> 00:59.475
Come on! Let's go, man! Let's go!

01:02.978 --> 01:05.940
17-0-2, be advised.
We're in pursuit of a black Acura

01:06.024 --> 01:08.276
travelling at a high speed on Belle.

01:08.359 --> 01:12.238
Headed towards Gwynn Oak.
Wanted on CDS violations.

01:12.321 --> 01:14.865
-17-0-2, 10-4.
-Motherfucker, you wanna roll? Roll.

01:14.948 --> 01:17.117
-The driver's wanted for CDS.
-Get on the right! Get on the right!

01:17.618 --> 01:20.162
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
-Just take it slow. See me on the back?

01:20.497 --> 01:22.164
-Stay the fuck there!
-KGA to 17-0-2,

01:22.247 --> 01:23.625
-break off pursuit.
-Shut the fuck...

01:23.708 --> 01:25.292
-Break this off, motherfucker.
-Do you copy?

01:25.375 --> 01:26.377
Careful, bro.

01:30.881 --> 01:33.510
I ain't gonna fucking stop, motherfucker.
I'm right on you now.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.931
Hang on! Hang on!

01:38.014 --> 01:39.933
Ah, come... Motherfucker!

01:45.771 --> 01:46.813
Slow down.

01:48.650 --> 01:49.609
Copy.

01:57.115 --> 01:58.701
-Show me your hands!
-Get out of the car!

01:58.785 --> 02:00.077
-Get the fuck out of the car!
-Hands!

02:00.160 --> 02:01.411
-Hands!
-Hands!

02:01.495 --> 02:03.832
-Out of the car! Hands!
-On the ground! On your belly!

02:03.915 --> 02:05.333
Hands behind your back!

02:06.416 --> 02:07.459
Why the fuck did you book?

02:08.585 --> 02:10.380
-Get up. Come on.
-Man, we didn't know you were cops.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.798
-You didn't even show us your badge.
-Don't give me that fucking bullshit.

02:12.881 --> 02:14.550
You seen our misery lights.
I don't wanna hear that.

02:14.634 --> 02:15.884
Man, I ain't seen shit!

02:17.678 --> 02:18.845
Cross your legs.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.306
-Damn!
-44-51.

02:20.389 --> 02:22.599
-10-4, 44-51.
-Yeah, I need an ambulance at the corner

02:22.684 --> 02:23.934
of Gwynn Oak and Belle Ave.

02:24.018 --> 02:25.478
-You're not gonna find nothing.
-Okay.

02:25.561 --> 02:27.354
Requesting a 10-38 at Belle and Gwynn Oak
right away.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.232
Ma'am... ma'am, are you hurt?

02:29.565 --> 02:31.734
Ma'am... ma'am, I need you to try
to hold still, okay?

02:31.817 --> 02:33.695
There's an ambulance on the way,
all right?

02:33.777 --> 02:35.488
-Ma'am, I need you to try to breathe.
-Please, Allen...

02:35.571 --> 02:37.282
-Are you hurt?
-...wake up!

02:37.364 --> 02:39.700
-Okay.
-No, no, no!

02:39.784 --> 02:40.784
Fuck!

02:42.954 --> 02:44.581
Told you, there's nothing in there.

02:44.663 --> 02:45.915
I don't have that number in the system.

02:45.998 --> 02:47.417
-Please repeat the last four.
-Car's clean!

02:47.499 --> 02:49.002
-Bullshit!
-5-4-0-1.

02:49.084 --> 02:51.713
You know these fuckers are dirty.
What'd you do? You toss it out the window?

02:51.795 --> 02:52.963
-No.
-What's up?

02:53.047 --> 02:54.674
-No.
-5-4-0-1,

02:54.756 --> 02:56.883
running it through the system. Standby.

02:56.967 --> 02:58.261
-Fuck!
-Why? You got nothing?

02:58.343 --> 02:59.845
-No, man.
-23-12.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.557
23-12, go ahead.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.520
They're clean, there's nothing on 'em.

03:08.645 --> 03:09.646
23-15, copy?

03:10.397 --> 03:12.608
Jenks. They're clean.
There's nothing on 'em.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.151
I'mma call the sergeant.

03:51.063 --> 03:52.105
-Back up.
-Back up.

03:55.318 --> 03:59.863
Baltimore is a poster child
for the basic failure to stop lawlessness.

04:00.781 --> 04:02.824
No justice, no peace!

04:02.909 --> 04:05.036
I've heard your calls for
"no justice, no peace."

04:05.369 --> 04:06.955
No justice, no peace!

04:35.775 --> 04:37.109
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

04:38.194 --> 04:41.447
These officers, they're 1930s-style
gangsters.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.627
You said Jenkins was worried, why?

04:55.043 --> 04:56.296
There's only a few situations

04:56.379 --> 04:58.798
where we're supposed to initiate
or continue a high-speed chase.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.758
A narcotics offense ain't one of them.

05:02.592 --> 05:03.885
I mean, we've got helicopters up there

05:03.969 --> 05:06.723
that could track a fleeing vehicle
without endangering innocent people.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.726
And the old man in the Monte Carlo?

05:11.852 --> 05:13.313
He rolled a seven, yeah.

05:13.687 --> 05:15.273
He was pronounced dead at the ER
at University.

05:15.814 --> 05:17.274
Baker 10, good morning...

05:18.067 --> 05:20.695
That's quite a CDR. Make sure
you add it to inventory.

05:21.570 --> 05:22.697
Right on.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.825
This was fatal.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.754
Hey, Sean.

05:39.546 --> 05:41.716
Do me a favor and just go toss the car
one more time.

05:41.799 --> 05:42.967
You know? In case we missed something.

05:54.687 --> 05:55.730
Jenkins...

06:09.744 --> 06:10.952
Jenk!

06:11.036 --> 06:12.704
It was on the floor, right under the seat.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.291
Man, you fucking planted that shit!

06:15.375 --> 06:18.335
Man, y'all cruddy as hell!
Y'all petty as shit. That's what y'all is.

06:18.794 --> 06:21.756
Get off me, man! Look, you guys know damn
well I ain't do that shit!

06:21.838 --> 06:23.089
I ain't got nothing to do with that!

06:23.174 --> 06:25.175
Man, you fucking planted that shit
on me, yo!

06:25.259 --> 06:26.718
You tryin' to frame my ass!

06:26.802 --> 06:29.387
Hey, how you gonna do me like that
knowing I had nothing to do with it?

06:29.721 --> 06:31.516
Everyone sees you looking at me.
It was nothing!

06:32.349 --> 06:35.977
Detective Ward, do you have any knowledge
of the Umar Burley incident

06:36.061 --> 06:38.689
that Wayne Jenkins was involved in
back in 2010?

06:39.689 --> 06:41.025
No, sir. I wasn't with Wayne then.

06:45.362 --> 06:50.450
Before we go any further,
my client, Mr. Ward, has something to say.

06:52.077 --> 06:53.119
Go ahead.

06:54.830 --> 06:56.624
I just wanna say I was wrong.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.253
I was involved in some bad things.

07:01.711 --> 07:03.672
I knew it was wrong at the time
and I know it now.

07:05.882 --> 07:09.553
I'm sorry for what I did.
Not just 'cause I got caught, but...

07:10.680 --> 07:11.722
sorry for real.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.016
I just want y'all to know that.

07:17.061 --> 07:18.019
Let's move on.

07:23.985 --> 07:28.156
By the time you got together with Jenkins
in 2015,

07:28.489 --> 07:29.698
he had made sergeant, correct?

07:30.575 --> 07:34.412
Yeah, Sergeant Jenkins invited me
to a new SES squad.

07:35.371 --> 07:38.039
I was hyped
because Jenkins was considered

07:38.124 --> 07:39.750
one of the best guys we had
in plainclothes.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.377
Nobody warned you about him?

07:44.172 --> 07:47.508
The only blowback I got
was from this guy I knew

07:47.591 --> 07:50.636
from the Western, Sean Suiter,
who... who works Homicide now.

07:52.054 --> 07:56.016
Suiter said, learn what I could from
Jenkins, and get out of the squad.

07:56.933 --> 07:59.060
He said Wayne was involved
in some crazy shit.

08:01.104 --> 08:02.106
Sean said...

08:03.106 --> 08:04.482
they protect Jenkins,

08:05.443 --> 08:07.904
and they leave the guys who work for him
to the wolves.

08:08.778 --> 08:11.240
-Who's "they"?
-The brass.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.534
I should've listened,
especially when I heard

08:15.035 --> 08:18.206
Jenkins just got off of being
in some jackpot over some case of his

08:18.288 --> 08:19.248
that went south.

08:20.248 --> 08:21.250
Elaborate.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.088
All I know, they took him off the streets
for a couple months.

08:27.047 --> 08:30.550
And the complaint came
from the State's Attorney's Office.

08:32.761 --> 08:34.222
But you joined the unit anyway?

08:38.558 --> 08:39.644
I made a poor decision.

08:46.650 --> 08:47.817
When I was making that list,

08:48.610 --> 08:50.362
I might have forgotten a few things.

08:51.071 --> 08:52.156
There were so many.

08:54.824 --> 08:55.785
Pick one.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.542
I can start with this one.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.422
What's BT stand for?

09:09.297 --> 09:10.298
Belvedere Towers.

09:12.175 --> 09:13.468
Okay, when did this happen?

09:14.679 --> 09:16.806
Spring, 2015.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.474
And who was with you?

09:20.517 --> 09:21.559
Jenkins and Taylor.

09:22.936 --> 09:24.605
Yo, we about to get up in that car trunk.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.524
Yeah, that's the fucking jackpot.

09:29.109 --> 09:30.276
Check out those two.

09:31.444 --> 09:32.612
Come on, let's get some.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.240
Dealers were always hangin' around the BT.

09:36.993 --> 09:37.951
It was hot.

09:38.743 --> 09:39.911
Shit.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.747
Let me see your hands, gentlemen.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.000
What's going on, fellas?

09:45.667 --> 09:49.295
Now, look, I am a federal agent.
We are conducting a wiretap.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.215
You are not the targets
of our investigation,

09:51.299 --> 09:53.216
but we did overhear
that there was going to be a drug deal

09:53.301 --> 09:54.594
on this lot.
That's why we're here.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.471
Now, we do detect the smell of marijuana.
For that reason,

09:57.555 --> 09:59.097
we're gonna have to go ahead
and search your vehicle.

09:59.180 --> 10:01.642
Why don't you guys do me a favor, go ahead
and take a seat on the curb for me?

10:01.726 --> 10:03.226
-Come on, man.
-Yo, I didn't give you permission

10:03.311 --> 10:04.478
to search my shit, yo.

10:04.561 --> 10:05.687
-Fuck is you talking about, yo?
-Calm down.

10:05.771 --> 10:06.981
-You can't do this.
-I don't think you listening, dumb-dumb,

10:07.064 --> 10:08.815
-I don't need a reason.
-I don't know who the fuck you think

10:08.899 --> 10:10.860
-you talking to. You don't know me.
-Tell your boy to calm down.

10:10.942 --> 10:12.485
Cross your legs. Hands behind your back.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.155
-And quiet.
-You don't know me.

10:14.863 --> 10:16.866
Y'all ain't got nothing better
to fucking do, yo.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.702
-Yo, this shit is phony as hell, yo.
-This shit is fucked up.

10:19.784 --> 10:21.327
You don't know what the fuck
y'all talking about.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.830
-What is that on your shoe?
-Quiet, yo.

10:22.912 --> 10:24.665
-What you talking...
-Look down. Don't look up, okay? Just...

10:25.458 --> 10:27.584
On that wall behind you
they've got a security camera.

10:28.126 --> 10:30.838
Just in case we find something in the car
and we want to put it in our car.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.256
Don't wanna get caught on camera, okay?

10:32.340 --> 10:35.092
So, just pull the car up a little bit and
lose the camera. Can you do that?

10:35.175 --> 10:36.302
-Copy.
-My man.

10:47.104 --> 10:48.397
Go and get a donut and coffee.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.776
You... You... You hungry right now?
I know you want that donut, yo.

10:52.233 --> 10:55.196
You need your man's help?
Look, he's gonna come up to me real quick.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.238
What's up fellas?

10:58.865 --> 11:00.034
You good, my man?

11:02.160 --> 11:03.578
Ain't got nothing better to do,
I hear you.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.538
You know, you need to be worried about
your mother at home.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.376
-Yo, don't worry about it, man.
-You ain't from around here, yo.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.169
They just got you on duty, yo.

11:11.294 --> 11:13.213
That's your little...
That's your puppet master over there.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.298
-For sure, yeah.
-Damn straight.

11:16.091 --> 11:18.094
Okay, gentlemen,
we're gonna cut you loose.

11:18.176 --> 11:19.511
You give their IDs back.

11:20.428 --> 11:22.973
You're gonna get something from us
in the mail called a target letter.

11:23.057 --> 11:25.059
Okay? We apologize for the inconvenience.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.770
We hope you guys have a good night.
You guys stay safe.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.609
-Think they got us, yo?
-Hell yeah.

11:34.609 --> 11:35.777
All the green.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.279
See you around.

11:38.488 --> 11:40.700
Hell yeah,
them thieving bitches got it all.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.993
I fucking hate them, yo. Bullshit.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.581
Where the fuck are we going, yo?

11:54.295 --> 11:55.463
Let's go.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.600
Well, I just gotta check to see
if there's a GPS tracker in here.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.104
I think we're good.

12:14.107 --> 12:15.400
That's five stacks for you.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.406
Five for you. Good shit, gentlemen.

12:20.738 --> 12:21.824
What about the rest?

12:22.908 --> 12:24.284
Come on, man.

12:24.367 --> 12:25.661
Come on, Sarge.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.122
Gonna buy a crash bar.

12:28.622 --> 12:29.707
-A crash bar?
-Crash bar?

12:29.790 --> 12:31.751
Yeah.
For the front of my new departmental.

12:32.584 --> 12:34.211
-Aw, hell no.
-For what? For that piece of shit?

12:34.294 --> 12:36.172
Hey, don't do that, don't talk shit
about my ride, all right?

12:36.254 --> 12:39.632
Hey, listen to me, listen to me.
You be smart. You understand?

12:40.384 --> 12:43.262
No fucking banks, all right?
Don't pay off fucking credit card bills.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.221
No shit like that.
You just go a little bit at a time.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.973
-Let it trickle out. You understand?
-Got it.

12:47.056 --> 12:48.766
-Yeah, you good?
-We got you.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.062
Shut the trunk.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

12:53.313 --> 12:56.566
I think we need to go look at some women.
How 'bout we hit up that Millstream?

12:57.609 --> 13:00.196
-That farm to table strip joint?
-That's the one.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.992
Hey, Maurice?
Man, what the fuck you doing?

13:05.074 --> 13:06.660
While we still got teeth in our heads!

13:07.203 --> 13:08.953
But I put my share of that money back.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.876
Why? Why would you do that?

13:16.419 --> 13:20.007
My wife is a BPD officer and she clean,
all right?

13:21.507 --> 13:22.675
But, also, I was scared.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.222
We took a whole lot of money
and pounds of weed.

13:26.304 --> 13:28.849
I... I didn't know who we just jacked up,
it could've been DEA,

13:28.932 --> 13:30.350
it could've been informants,
I didn't know.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.771
Look, I know y'all don't believe me,
but I put that money back.

13:33.853 --> 13:36.148
You can put me on the box under oath,
you'll see.

13:36.231 --> 13:40.611
Let me see if I understand this.
You were uncomfortable with taking money,

13:40.694 --> 13:42.655
or you were uncomfortable
with taking that amount of money?

13:43.864 --> 13:44.822
That amount.

13:45.533 --> 13:48.201
When I was in district plainclothes,
you know, we'd jack up corners

13:48.285 --> 13:49.535
and skim a little bit off the dealers.

13:49.619 --> 13:52.289
You know, tax 'em a little bit.
But, man, this was another level.

13:52.372 --> 13:53.915
It was... It was too much.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.875
So why take it in the first place?

13:57.835 --> 13:59.003
Jenkins was my sergeant.

14:00.296 --> 14:01.881
He told us what to do and we did it.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.634
Nobody bucked him.
We just did what he said.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.344
You gotta understand,
he'd been working plainclothes

14:06.427 --> 14:08.012
for like ten years at this point.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.641
And he was a damn legend for all the drugs
and guns he could put on the table.

14:11.725 --> 14:12.935
He owned them streets.

14:21.485 --> 14:22.860
There's a little more about that night.

14:24.279 --> 14:25.447
If you wanna hear it.

14:37.918 --> 14:40.045
Ain't you done, girl?
You smell good for a white girl.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.756
That's my fuckin' shit.

14:43.339 --> 14:46.635
-Holy motherfuckin' shit.
-Oh, my Lord.

14:46.718 --> 14:49.095
-You're on fire, baby.
-That's fire!

14:50.096 --> 14:51.931
I don't believe it...
She's fucking gorgeous.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.434
Holy shit!

14:55.977 --> 14:59.440
Okay. Okay, girl. Goddamn!

14:59.522 --> 15:02.276
Hey, this is the greatest
motherfuckin' place on earth.

15:02.358 --> 15:05.195
This is... Fuckin' look at her!
Hey, hey, hey, listen, listen.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.904
Do me a favor sweetheart, go talk to her.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.324
Get her ass off this stage,

15:08.407 --> 15:10.199
tell her to come meet me
in a VIP, all right?

15:10.284 --> 15:11.410
Yeah, yeah, I got you, boo.

15:11.492 --> 15:12.952
Shit. You know I'm gonna come correct.

15:13.036 --> 15:15.873
Fucking stick your fucking hand
out like that. Go get her. Boom.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.373
-Fuck you, man.
-Just go fucking get her.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.376
-Oh, she's twerkin'.
-Let me tell you something,

15:20.460 --> 15:21.587
I'mma fuck her.

15:21.669 --> 15:23.839
I swear to God. Mother...
Yes, I am. Watch me, I swe...

15:23.923 --> 15:25.423
Deadass, I'mma fuck her. Watch me!

15:25.507 --> 15:27.593
-Calm your ass down.
-I... I swear to God, on my own life,

15:27.675 --> 15:29.136
-I'm gonna fuck her.
-Jenkins, fuckin' how?

15:29.218 --> 15:31.639
What do you mean, how?
I'mma fucking handle my business, baby.

15:31.721 --> 15:33.264
What y'all gon' fucking do?

15:33.349 --> 15:35.017
-You don't think I will?
-Hell, no!

15:35.099 --> 15:36.185
This liquor got you horny.

15:36.267 --> 15:37.394
-That's the problem.
-Here she comes.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.395
What's up, you gorgeous thing?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.774
Goddamn, it's an honor to meet you,
sweet thing.

15:41.856 --> 15:43.316
-What's goin' on?
-I got you. You're mine.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.276
You's a nasty motherfucker.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.904
-You see how I roll.
-He's deadass.

15:50.198 --> 15:52.368
Hey, put it up there. Yes, sir. My man.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.411
Seventy-five percent
of that body weight is ass.

15:56.454 --> 15:58.289
-He's doing his thing, man.
-He goin' too hard.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.793
How was your steak, man?
Mine was fuckin' slappin'!

16:01.417 --> 16:03.878
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Variety in everything

16:03.963 --> 16:05.130
is the spice of life.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.382
Bro, that's some sick shit, bro.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.009
Let your man live.

16:09.092 --> 16:12.304
-What the fuck he about to do with that?
-Jenkins is crazy, man, but let him live.

16:12.387 --> 16:13.805
-Bro, that's... Bro.
-Why is that sick?

16:13.889 --> 16:15.683
You was just saying how she was twerking.

16:15.765 --> 16:16.933
Hey, yo. Yo, we gotta bounce.

16:17.017 --> 16:18.268
-That was quick.
-Shut the fuck up, man.

16:18.351 --> 16:19.728
When I say we gotta bounce,
we gotta bounce.

16:19.811 --> 16:21.522
Yo man, them steaks good?
I'll take this motherfucker.

16:21.604 --> 16:23.314
Lemme take the fucking beer too,
let's go.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.857
What's going on? Watch the fuck out.

16:26.192 --> 16:27.778
Come on man,
let's get the fuck outta here. Let's go

16:28.487 --> 16:31.406
-Come on, we gotta go.
-Come on, come on.

16:31.906 --> 16:34.034
Yo, what the...
Jenkins, what the fuck did you...

16:35.660 --> 16:37.871
-Hot damn, man!
-Get in the fucking car already.

16:40.623 --> 16:41.666
Let's go!

16:44.001 --> 16:46.129
Wayne, man.
We wasn't even in there an hour!

16:46.213 --> 16:47.464
Hey, look, man. All right, look, look.

16:47.547 --> 16:49.675
That little fucking mini-me motherfucker

16:49.757 --> 16:52.760
was on top of me for, like, five seconds.
I couldn't fit inside of her.

16:52.845 --> 16:56.139
So I knew that shit wasn't gonna happen,
so I just dumped her right on the ground

16:56.223 --> 16:57.891
-and I...
-She put it on you, didn't she?

16:57.974 --> 16:59.852
-Nah, man.
-She put it on you, didn't she?

16:59.934 --> 17:02.104
-I'll tell you what she didn't do...
-She put all that ass on him.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.688
Yeah, I'll tell you what happened
motherfucker.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.022
Hey, I grabbed her fuckin' money

17:05.107 --> 17:06.941
and I bailed the fuck out.
That's what happened.

17:07.483 --> 17:08.610
-You kidding me?
-Check this shit out.

17:08.693 --> 17:09.819
Yeah, you fuckin' heard me.

17:10.361 --> 17:13.364
Hey, look. It's like twice as much
as I fucking gave her.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.075
Hee-haw, motherfucker.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.787
-You robbed the midget stripper?
-Come on, don't put it like that, man.

17:23.124 --> 17:24.834
-That's not cool.
-Come on.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.627
That's not cool, Sarge.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.964
A midget?

17:30.090 --> 17:31.716
Dwarf is the preferred term.

17:32.758 --> 17:35.721
Pardon my language,
but that was one fucked-up night.

17:35.803 --> 17:38.307
Detective Ward, besides Suiter,

17:38.389 --> 17:40.475
you must've known about Wayne Jenkins

17:40.559 --> 17:42.102
even before you joined the SES,

17:42.185 --> 17:44.228
his... his reputation
had to have preceded him.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.774
Yeah, but mostly because of
his arrest numbers.

17:46.856 --> 17:48.150
I think I first met him

17:48.566 --> 17:51.028
before I joined the squad,
around the time he got his stripes,

17:51.111 --> 17:53.571
right before he got shipped off
to Northeast patrol.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.951
Ain't you something.
Shit, I can't afford this nice-ass car.

17:59.327 --> 18:00.828
How do you afford a car like this, sir?

18:00.913 --> 18:03.122
-I work.
-Shit, man.

18:03.206 --> 18:04.499
You got... You must have a nice job.

18:04.999 --> 18:07.795
-That's a fancy ass town.
-Come on, Hersl. Hurry it up.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.006
Look at this motherfucker?

18:12.089 --> 18:13.925
-Aye!
-Isn't this a beautiful day for justice?

18:14.009 --> 18:15.552
-You know what I'm sayin'?
-Look at this pretty bitch

18:15.635 --> 18:17.179
-in his dark blue ensemble.
-Oh, no.

18:17.261 --> 18:19.388
Three stripes for each arm,
each sleeve, man.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.479
You know, I heard it
and I did not motherfuckin' believe it.

18:25.561 --> 18:27.523
Hey.
You better get used to it, motherfucker.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.108
I guess they'll make anybody
a sergeant nowadays.

18:29.190 --> 18:30.692
God, it's a beautiful day
in America, innit?

18:30.775 --> 18:32.360
-Sup, big boy?
-Hey! Where you headed, baby?

18:32.444 --> 18:34.737
-I'm goin' up to the barn. Tell you what?
-All right, congrats, Wayne.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.156
Y'all come through, man, I appreciate you.

18:36.239 --> 18:38.324
So you're just goin' around showing
everybody your pretty new stripes?

18:38.407 --> 18:40.409
I gotta do what I gotta do.
Hey, youngster, you wanna come?

18:41.035 --> 18:42.371
Hey, you ever seen the Roger Rabbit?

18:44.456 --> 18:45.456
Oh, give it to him!

18:46.875 --> 18:48.793
-Spin off with it.
-This some bullshit, man.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.297
Hey, look, when you guys get done
with this bullshit, come on up.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.924
I bought a case of beer in my own honor.

18:54.298 --> 18:55.299
Oh, all right.

18:56.050 --> 18:57.803
Happy Wayne Jenkins Day, motherfuckers!

19:06.145 --> 19:07.520
Looks and sounds like an asshole.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.523
-Okay.
-Champ is here.

19:16.904 --> 19:18.699
What you think, LT?
See, this is about the best decision

19:18.781 --> 19:21.117
-this department ever made.
-Fucker finally made it.

19:21.867 --> 19:24.913
Tells me how fucked up the department is
that they gave you stripes.

19:28.041 --> 19:29.877
All right, so where are they sending ya?

19:31.128 --> 19:32.795
The northeast. Thank you, Charlie.

19:33.379 --> 19:34.880
I can't believe you drink that piss.

19:34.964 --> 19:37.008
What, did you confiscate it off
a 16-year-old girl?

19:37.092 --> 19:39.885
Ah, man... Hey, hey, look, man,
that's my super juice.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.306
Northeast,
so they probably just got you out there

19:43.055 --> 19:44.224
suppressing them kids on dirt bikes, now?

19:45.057 --> 19:46.392
Hey, man, I'mma make that money
wherever I'm at.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.062
Hey, happy Wayne Jenkins Day, everybody.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.355
Oh, fuck you.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.652
Describe your experience, please,
and tell us your juror number.

19:56.068 --> 19:57.738
Four-eighty-six, sir.

19:58.112 --> 20:01.574
Your Honor, I was beaten by police
as I was put in a jail van.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.285
And what were you being jailed for?

20:03.367 --> 20:04.869
I attended a BLM rally.

20:04.952 --> 20:06.622
Was there violence at that rally?

20:06.704 --> 20:08.080
As I said, I was beaten.

20:08.581 --> 20:09.915
Were you combative, sir?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.459
I'm a pacifist, Your Honor.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.753
Were the charges against you upheld?

20:13.836 --> 20:15.880
No, they were dropped eventually.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.800
From that experience, you feel
you could not credit the testimony

20:18.884 --> 20:20.593
of the police officers in this case?

20:20.677 --> 20:21.844
From that experience,

20:22.178 --> 20:25.264
I wouldn't believe a Baltimore officer
who'd testify that his mother loved him.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.226
-Is it soup yet?
-Hardly.

20:27.642 --> 20:29.977
-You are dismissed, sir.
-We won't have a full jury and panel

20:30.062 --> 20:31.520
until tomorrow at best.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.314
-Thank you for your service.
-What's taking so long?

20:33.398 --> 20:34.566
Well, what do you think?

20:34.649 --> 20:36.026
Now, what about juror number 574?

20:37.152 --> 20:38.111
Stand up, sir.

20:39.612 --> 20:42.032
Will you describe your experience
for the court, please?

20:42.115 --> 20:44.241
Your Honor, I was arrested
by Baltimore police.

20:44.325 --> 20:46.160
They picked me up for loitering
and disorderly.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.080
Were you loitering, sir?

20:48.580 --> 20:50.082
All I was doing was coming
from my sister's house.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.542
Police said I was there buying drugs,
I wasn't buying drugs.

20:53.459 --> 20:55.128
She just had a baby
and I was just bringing her

20:55.211 --> 20:56.295
some baby stuff, Your Honor.

20:56.380 --> 20:59.882
Because of that experience, you are sure
you could not be an impartial judge

20:59.965 --> 21:01.593
of the evidence in this case?

21:01.677 --> 21:03.220
Is the evidence coming from
Baltimore police?

21:03.594 --> 21:04.637
'Cause if that's the case,

21:04.721 --> 21:06.014
I know they ain't gonna
have no problem lying.

21:06.765 --> 21:09.016
Sir, can I ask, was this
your only experience

21:09.100 --> 21:10.643
with a Baltimore police officer

21:10.727 --> 21:13.771
falsifying evidence against you
or someone in your family?

21:13.855 --> 21:15.983
Aside from when I was locked up,
they also beat on my son.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.777
Then said he swung on them first.
That was a lie, too.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.781
-Was your son charged in that incident?
-For a New York minute.

21:23.114 --> 21:25.575
Once he got down to Eagle Street,
they dropped the charges quick,

21:25.659 --> 21:27.284
but he still got stitches
in his head though.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.828
And they wrote the thing in such a way

21:28.911 --> 21:30.580
that when we tried to complain
to the police department,

21:30.663 --> 21:32.916
they said, "No. He swung first
and needed to get hit."

21:32.998 --> 21:35.711
The court will strike juror number 574.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.087
You are dismissed, sir.

21:37.879 --> 21:39.423
Please report back
to the juror assembly room,

21:40.005 --> 21:41.717
and thank you for your service today.

21:42.967 --> 21:45.971
Are there any other jurors
who have had prior experiences

21:46.430 --> 21:49.432
that would cause them to disregard
the testimony of the police officers?

21:50.684 --> 21:51.977
Stand up, sir.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.231
Describe your experience, please,
and tell us your juror number.

21:57.314 --> 21:58.650
452, here.

22:02.571 --> 22:03.613
How's yours?

22:04.071 --> 22:05.030
Let's put it this way.

22:05.573 --> 22:07.576
Chi-town's got Maryland
beat on the crab cake front.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.077
Please, tell me something real.

22:12.247 --> 22:15.833
How's this? I've been doin' a deeper dive
on that list of officers and detectives

22:16.250 --> 22:18.586
that the circuit court trial teams
wouldn't put on the stand.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.423
There was a formal list at one point,
sent as a complaint

22:21.505 --> 22:23.258
to the police department
but now it's just something

22:23.340 --> 22:25.885
that gets passed around
by trial prosecutors.

22:25.968 --> 22:26.927
But get this,

22:27.346 --> 22:28.554
the list comes with specifics.

22:29.305 --> 22:32.351
Known histories of false statements
or perjury in open court.

22:33.143 --> 22:35.019
Sworn officers? Known perjuries?

22:36.312 --> 22:37.814
But here's the amazing thing,

22:39.149 --> 22:41.651
they're all supposedly
still on the street, doing what they do.

22:42.109 --> 22:43.528
Their arrests just never come to court.

22:43.611 --> 22:44.780
Not if the P.C. or evidence

22:44.863 --> 22:45.988
-requires their testimony.
-Wow.

22:47.449 --> 22:48.616
What, nobody ordered for me?

22:49.242 --> 22:51.202
All right, we're gonna leave you
to your lunch.

22:51.994 --> 22:53.078
Come on, Ahmed.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.456
I wanna see a man
answer a simple question,

22:56.291 --> 22:57.750
and I want you to watch him try.

23:02.129 --> 23:04.465
Motherfucker clocked the rearview
for two seconds too long.

23:04.548 --> 23:05.967
Then I seen that shoulder dip.

23:06.050 --> 23:08.053
I'm telling you,
there's an art to this shit, K-Stop.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.431
Boss man, I don't know
what you're laughin' at.

23:12.056 --> 23:13.891
Fucking string bean-looking motherfucker.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.226
Why does your car smell like that?

23:16.937 --> 23:17.938
What do you got?

23:18.312 --> 23:20.273
Got a little nine under the driver's seat,

23:20.357 --> 23:22.233
about 40 vials of coke in the glovebox.

23:23.025 --> 23:24.902
I can't wait to see
what's in this motherfucker's trunk.

23:25.694 --> 23:26.737
Give me one second.

23:27.947 --> 23:29.323
Shit. Give me a sec.

23:31.909 --> 23:32.952
What's goin' on, baby?

23:33.036 --> 23:34.745
We're at practice and he's saying
he doesn't want to play.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.290
He's your son. Talk to him.

23:37.373 --> 23:39.000
-All right, I'm on my way. Yeah.
-Okay.

23:39.959 --> 23:42.212
K-stop. I gotta go, man.

23:43.379 --> 23:44.548
You weren't gonna pop the trunk?

23:44.630 --> 23:47.884
Ah, you heard what I said.
This lockup's yours, bud.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.719
-What's the matter?
-It's my kid.

23:50.386 --> 23:51.762
You go on and take the collar.

23:51.847 --> 23:52.805
Copy that, Sarge.

24:00.521 --> 24:02.606
-What's goin' on, double trouble?
-Oh, man!

24:04.109 --> 24:05.985
-How you doin', hon?
-Hey, Wayne.

24:06.527 --> 24:10.031
Shit, man. Look at that uniform.
What are you, Officer Friendly?

24:10.115 --> 24:12.951
-Look at that shit, man.
-Hey, man, don't get used to it.

24:13.033 --> 24:15.452
I just got that transfer down to SES.

24:15.537 --> 24:17.372
-Already?
-Yes, sir. Ten months.

24:17.454 --> 24:18.915
Rotated out of plainclothes.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.542
I'm setting a record up in this bitch.

24:21.208 --> 24:23.752
Most of these humps, they do a year,
maybe two in patrol

24:23.837 --> 24:25.087
when they make sergeant, but hey,

24:25.464 --> 24:26.548
not Wayne Jenkins.

24:27.381 --> 24:28.924
Don't forget, takin' tomorrow off.

24:29.008 --> 24:31.261
We're gonna go to casino,
we gonna have some fun, man.

24:31.761 --> 24:34.639
We're gonna eat some better shit
than this right here, I'll tell you that.

24:34.722 --> 24:37.099
Listen, D,
I can't roll with you on that, man.

24:37.600 --> 24:38.977
-The fuck?
-Yeah, my oldest, he...

24:41.228 --> 24:45.025
he's got Peewee football try-outs,
and he's... he's all spinned out.

24:45.859 --> 24:48.569
He thinks he's not good enough,
might not do the league this year.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.989
-What?
-Yeah, I don't know, some kid,

24:51.072 --> 24:52.574
he rung his bell the other day, and...

24:53.658 --> 24:56.368
I don't know, it got him all shook.
I mean, I went right home to be with him.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.788
I mean, I'm in the middle of a gun arrest
over on Sinclair Lane,

24:58.872 --> 25:01.540
Kristy calls me, she says he's spiraling,
you know, he needs me.

25:01.624 --> 25:03.793
So I... Yeah, I just...
I left my squad right there,

25:03.876 --> 25:06.003
I just hightailed it home to him, and...

25:06.837 --> 25:09.173
Look, man, he's got a practice on Saturday
and I gotta go with him,

25:09.257 --> 25:10.342
that's what I'm doin'.

25:10.424 --> 25:13.260
-Well, you're just a good dad, then.
-Yes, I am.

25:15.638 --> 25:16.889
All right, well, great!

25:18.766 --> 25:19.767
Listen...

25:21.143 --> 25:24.147
Donny, let me run something by you.

25:24.229 --> 25:25.357
I don't know, I was just...

25:27.234 --> 25:28.192
you know...

25:28.777 --> 25:30.444
thinking about that thing
we were talkin' about.

25:35.491 --> 25:37.242
You know, if you wanna talk about it,
I'm just sayin'.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.497
You know, we could. For real.

25:41.831 --> 25:43.208
I ain't bullshitting you, Donny. I'm...

25:43.999 --> 25:45.918
I'm the best fuckin' cop
in this department, man.

25:46.877 --> 25:48.922
Straight up, man, these motherfuckers,
they cannot touch me.

25:49.004 --> 25:50.255
But I gotta listen to their bullshit.

25:50.339 --> 25:52.633
Them ragging on me 'cause I ain't got
their kinda fuckin' cash.

25:52.716 --> 25:54.344
I mean, fuck that, man. Fuck that.

25:56.553 --> 25:57.514
Yeah.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.516
I could offload it for a number upfront.

26:01.058 --> 26:02.936
What, man. Like, what you thinkin'?

26:03.894 --> 26:07.190
Well, you know,
I'm mostly into coke, so 15?

26:09.108 --> 26:10.651
If that's steady, 15 is good.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.571
-Yeah, steady's good.
-Yeah.

26:13.363 --> 26:16.491
And what about if, you know,
if I can get my hands on some other shit?

26:17.242 --> 26:18.993
Oh, I'd have to pass that along
right now.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.954
But you know, if this works out,

26:21.537 --> 26:23.163
there's gonna be plenty upfront,
all right?

26:24.498 --> 26:26.710
-Shit, man, that's cool too.
-Okay.

26:26.792 --> 26:29.670
This a good time
to introduce the other twin tower,

26:29.754 --> 26:31.255
Derek Hines,
he's joined the prosecution team.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.341
-Nice to meet you all.
-Erika, if you would.

26:36.261 --> 26:39.096
Well, we're getting good stuff
on the wiretaps.

26:39.180 --> 26:42.182
And it's becoming increasingly clear
there's a real problem

26:42.267 --> 26:43.893
in the department's gun-trace task force.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.562
Gondo, Rayam, maybe others.

26:47.104 --> 26:49.316
Supervision there is in flux
with their last commander,

26:49.399 --> 26:52.609
Sergeant Thomas Allers,
having signed on to the DEA task force.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.029
Who's got that unit now?

26:54.737 --> 26:57.490
Wayne Jenkins is taking over,
he's coming over from SES.

26:57.573 --> 26:59.576
He's got a reputation as a hard charger.

27:00.535 --> 27:02.995
I actually crossed paths with him
about three years ago

27:03.078 --> 27:05.582
when I was on the safe streets team.

27:05.956 --> 27:08.500
Somewhat of a cowboy,
but I don't think he's corrupt.

27:08.877 --> 27:13.381
Erika thought we might advise Jenkins
that he's walking into a buzzsaw

27:13.464 --> 27:14.424
with Gondo and Rayam.

27:17.092 --> 27:18.053
Something wrong, Scott?

27:20.680 --> 27:24.433
No, I... I don't know Jenkins personally,
but his name has come up a few times.

27:25.184 --> 27:29.104
Especially on a jailhouse call
that I listened to about three years ago

27:29.189 --> 27:31.316
between our two narcotics targets,

27:31.398 --> 27:32.359
Shropshire and Glen Wells.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.611
Not without them coming out
and saying it point blank...

27:36.071 --> 27:37.488
it felt like they knew he was dirty.

27:39.407 --> 27:41.493
We have a transcript of this call?

27:41.575 --> 27:43.370
Yeah, it's in our files,
and I'll... I'll get it to you.

27:45.413 --> 27:46.538
Why don't we let it run?

27:47.290 --> 27:48.457
Revisit this in couple weeks.

27:50.126 --> 27:51.127
Makes sense to me.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.129
Thank you.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.220
Why are these cops still on the street?

28:00.303 --> 28:02.555
If they can't even testify
in a Baltimore courtroom

28:02.639 --> 28:04.140
for having perjured themselves already?

28:04.224 --> 28:05.390
Between you and me,

28:05.475 --> 28:08.144
the history of this thing
is tangled up in all the infighting

28:08.227 --> 28:10.730
between the State's Attorney's office
and the department.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.525
It goes back to Pat Jessamy
and Fred Bealefeld

28:14.609 --> 28:15.860
being angry as hell at each other

28:15.944 --> 28:18.196
and not listening to anything that either
one had to say.

28:18.695 --> 28:19.738
Explain.

28:20.447 --> 28:21.658
When Fred was commissioner,

28:22.200 --> 28:23.826
he was furious at Jessamy

28:23.909 --> 28:26.495
for dropping cases
and refusing prosecutions

28:26.579 --> 28:29.708
and Jessamy was critical

28:30.124 --> 28:33.001
of the quality of the case work.
They stopped talking.

28:34.294 --> 28:37.757
And so, any list of officers
who was unwelcome to testify

28:37.841 --> 28:39.007
in circuit court

28:39.092 --> 28:42.762
was seen as just another shot fired
in that ongoing argument.

28:43.387 --> 28:46.599
So, these cops caught lying
remained on the street?

28:47.015 --> 28:49.227
They did, and here I am.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.898
-He's honest at least.
-To a point.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.653
He told us what happened
when Bealefeld was commissioner.

28:59.237 --> 29:01.489
But that list was still around
when Batts was commissioner

29:01.573 --> 29:02.615
and it's still around now.

29:03.198 --> 29:05.910
And whether or not the state's attorney
charges a criminal case,

29:06.618 --> 29:08.912
what's to stop this department from,
right now,

29:08.996 --> 29:10.915
researching all the false statements

29:11.248 --> 29:13.125
and firing every cop caught in a lie?

29:15.460 --> 29:16.795
That's a good point.

29:21.050 --> 29:22.594
-How the fuck did you run him over?
-Fuck!

29:22.677 --> 29:23.887
Hey, don't fucking freeze up on me.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.805
Cut that engine and go look at that lawn.

29:25.888 --> 29:26.848
Go find a gun.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.977
Hey, you trying to win
an Academy Award out here, huh?

29:32.978 --> 29:34.730
-Over here?
-You find anything?

29:34.813 --> 29:35.856
No.

29:36.399 --> 29:38.400
-How far can he fucking toss it?
-The fuck you run for, dawg?

29:39.151 --> 29:42.362
Let me get you an ambulance. 24-50.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.741
-10-4, 24-50.
-Yeah, I need an ambulance

29:44.824 --> 29:48.327
at the corner of Anntana and Belair Road.
I got a number one male hit by my vehicle.

29:48.745 --> 29:49.954
Also send A.I.U.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.372
-Sending a 10-38.
-Fuck.

29:52.415 --> 29:54.875
-Copy, ambo on the way.
-You find that gun?

29:54.959 --> 29:57.920
I'm not seeing it. There's no fucking gun.

29:58.588 --> 30:00.339
Oh, quit being a hump
and keep fuckin' looking.

30:01.674 --> 30:03.092
Son of a bitch.

30:13.018 --> 30:16.064
Keith, what's going on, man?
Hey, look, I need your help. I got...

30:16.146 --> 30:18.065
-I'm in a little bit of jam, all right?
-I'm eating.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.858
Hey, fuck your food, okay. I need a piece.

30:20.901 --> 30:23.528
No, I need it, all right.
I'm... I'm on Anntana Road, off Belair.

30:24.364 --> 30:26.282
Just hurry up.
The fucking shift commander just posted.

30:26.365 --> 30:28.951
-Copy, on my way.
-Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.424
-The fuck you do?
-Yo, dawg. I'm chasing this motherfucker.

30:43.799 --> 30:46.094
He runs across the street,
he stops, he points a gun right at me.

30:46.176 --> 30:47.427
I had to hit him with the car.

30:48.053 --> 30:49.973
Where's the gun?
It's around here somewhere, man.

30:50.055 --> 30:51.181
He fucking pointed right at me.

30:53.351 --> 30:54.768
Let's find this gun. All right.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.980
Fan out, canvass the area,
look for surveillance cameras.

30:57.313 --> 30:58.730
Casey, escort the ambo.

30:59.399 --> 31:00.983
Hey, hey, you check that yard?

31:04.279 --> 31:05.280
Nothing over here.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.907
Yo, how about those bushes?

31:08.615 --> 31:10.034
Got to recanvass that side.

31:11.661 --> 31:12.912
I got that, let me take a look.

31:14.664 --> 31:16.373
What exactly did you witness?

31:17.292 --> 31:19.251
I was responding to a 24-50 on my radio.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.878
I was the S.I.C. for the shift but...

31:23.131 --> 31:24.214
I got there after the event.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.591
Jenks had already run that boy over.

31:51.867 --> 31:55.079
Fuck, Wayne, Jesus fucking Christ.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.332
It's under the truck up there, all right?
Just be cool.

31:58.707 --> 32:00.208
Uniform's gonna find it, all right?

32:00.293 --> 32:01.501
-Appreciate it.
-You're all right.

32:03.463 --> 32:05.548
Found evidence.
You might wanna get back up here.

32:05.630 --> 32:08.008
-What kinda evidence do you have?
-A firearm.

32:08.426 --> 32:09.427
Shit.

32:10.635 --> 32:13.181
-Hey, you got a gun, brother?
-Just under the rear of the truck.

32:13.263 --> 32:16.058
All right. All right, hey, hey,
everybody stay the fuck back, all right?

32:16.141 --> 32:17.769
Let's just...
We're gonna wait for the crime lab.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.147
-Copy that.
-Yeah. Good shit.

32:25.233 --> 32:26.694
Keith, man, you saved my ass.

32:26.777 --> 32:29.530
Well, I was in the middle
of my goddamn Peruvian chicken dinner,

32:29.613 --> 32:31.074
motherfucker, down at the Inner Harbor.

32:31.157 --> 32:32.240
Yeah, well you know I owe you.

32:32.617 --> 32:33.575
You fuckin' A right.

32:35.745 --> 32:37.413
Now that... Now that's a good one.

32:38.580 --> 32:39.581
Shit is off the hook.

32:40.582 --> 32:42.085
You know how many jurors we requested

32:42.417 --> 32:43.752
at the Judge's court today?

32:44.462 --> 32:45.545
A hundred-eighty.

32:46.172 --> 32:48.841
And at the end of the day,
we had seven souls empaneled.

32:49.842 --> 32:51.928
The rest I had to strike
or wait for the Judge to do it.

32:52.261 --> 32:53.929
-Defense strikes?
-Just a few.

32:54.471 --> 32:56.264
Retired cops, sheriff's deputies,

32:56.349 --> 32:59.018
and one angry mother
whose kid was killed in a street robbery.

32:59.434 --> 33:02.771
Hey, you got seven actual Baltimoreans
who are willing to believe police.

33:02.855 --> 33:04.774
Well, this is what it's come to, Sean.

33:05.357 --> 33:07.526
I mean, you guys have locked up
and beat on so many people

33:07.610 --> 33:10.570
we can't get 12 in a box
who are willing to trust what a cop says.

33:12.906 --> 33:13.990
Yeah, see you later.

33:14.659 --> 33:15.618
Yeah.

33:21.540 --> 33:24.126
Following up any complaints that came in
on Wayne Jenkins,

33:24.209 --> 33:26.962
and I think I might've stumbled into
a little bit of ugly.

33:27.838 --> 33:30.049
-What do you have?
-Video...

33:30.424 --> 33:33.218
-of a car stop Jenkins did two years ago.
-And?

33:34.594 --> 33:36.556
He searches the car, comes up dry.

33:36.972 --> 33:39.183
He then talks to the defendant
for close to 60 minutes,

33:40.143 --> 33:42.185
both on a lot and in his undercover car.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.982
Then the tape ran out.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.818
But subsequently, the defendant is charged

33:48.900 --> 33:51.612
with possession of seven ounces of cocaine
found in his vehicle.

33:53.113 --> 33:54.991
Upon seeing the tape,
which outright contradicted

33:55.074 --> 33:57.033
Jenkins's signed arrest statement,

33:57.702 --> 33:59.412
the prosecutor dropped charges...

34:02.081 --> 34:04.583
and notified the department's
Internal Affairs Division.

34:05.876 --> 34:06.918
Let's take a look.

34:18.597 --> 34:19.599
But it's not on the tape.

34:21.808 --> 34:24.729
Wayne, they're accusing you of lying about
finding cocaine in the defendant's car

34:24.812 --> 34:26.105
and the seizure's not on the tape.

34:26.564 --> 34:28.399
I must've found the drugs
after the camera went off.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.526
Camera goes on, it goes off,
that's what they do.

34:30.609 --> 34:31.902
-Wayne
-I'll call the prosecutor.

34:32.235 --> 34:33.863
I'll explain everything,
I'll make it right.

34:35.198 --> 34:38.868
Well, it wasn't long before the prosecutor
got this text message from Jenkins.

34:39.577 --> 34:40.620
It spooked her.

34:41.077 --> 34:44.164
Jenkins complains
that she's slandering his good name

34:44.540 --> 34:45.583
by calling him a dirty cop.

34:45.957 --> 34:47.126
Then he ends with the following,

34:47.792 --> 34:49.085
"This is not a promise,

34:49.169 --> 34:52.090
nor is it a threat to you
in any way, shape, or form,

34:52.173 --> 34:54.591
this is just hurting me and my
reputation."

34:55.218 --> 34:56.426
And how did the department

34:56.511 --> 34:58.679
deal with the accusation that Jenkins lied

34:58.762 --> 35:00.515
and then allegedly planted drugs?

35:01.348 --> 35:04.559
Internal Affairs recommended
that Jenkins be demoted, transferred,

35:04.644 --> 35:06.145
and suspended for 20 days.

35:07.730 --> 35:08.688
Was he?

35:17.531 --> 35:19.826
Detective Ward, early in 2015,

35:20.200 --> 35:24.079
Sergeant Jenkins was nearly suspended
for falsifying arrest reports.

35:24.788 --> 35:26.749
That punishment was reduced
to verbal counseling,

35:26.833 --> 35:29.085
and then they put him
right back on the street.

35:29.834 --> 35:31.754
Wasn't no way they was gonna throw
a shadow on a hero.

35:32.128 --> 35:33.339
I don't follow.

35:33.421 --> 35:35.174
You wanna know what happened
to that disciplinary case?

35:36.091 --> 35:37.301
Freddie Gray happened.

36:02.994 --> 36:03.953
What's going on, Major?

36:04.453 --> 36:06.122
Where is it bad? Where is it worst?

36:10.417 --> 36:11.543
Motherfucker.

36:14.463 --> 36:15.506
Is that fucking Danny?

36:16.465 --> 36:18.593
Well, look at that shit, man.
Hersl is on TV.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.010
Look at this simple motherfucker.

36:21.637 --> 36:23.723
Okay. Danny Hersl takes no man's shit.

36:25.724 --> 36:27.935
I'm gonna tell you right now,
it ain't gonna be like that bitch-ass shit

36:28.019 --> 36:29.145
we seen in Ferguson.

36:29.227 --> 36:30.646
-Not in Baltimore.
-Signal 13. Signal 13.

36:30.730 --> 36:33.733
Any available units respond
to the entrance at Druid Hill Park

36:33.816 --> 36:35.108
to assist injured officers.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.903
-Signal 13. Signal 13.
-We got fucking officers down.

36:36.986 --> 36:38.778
Motherfucker. Fuck this shit.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.489
Hey, let's fucking go.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.824
I'm fucking going,
anybody wanna roll with me?

36:42.907 --> 36:44.492
-I'll go with you, Jenkins.
-Okay, Ms. Ellis.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.120
-Let's do it.
-Okay, let's get some then.

36:46.536 --> 36:48.121
Geez, fucking gun belt's too short.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.957
I haven't worn this shit
since Ripken was playing.

36:50.040 --> 36:51.459
Sarge, you're gonna have to put me
on report,

36:51.542 --> 36:52.627
I can't get into these things.

36:53.085 --> 36:54.587
Come on, all you shit-talkers,

36:54.670 --> 36:55.920
show us what you got out there.

36:56.004 --> 36:57.464
I am too out of shape for this.

36:57.547 --> 37:00.091
Fuck Freddie Gray. And fuck the rioters.

37:00.175 --> 37:01.844
What we got? We got shit.

37:02.552 --> 37:03.512
Fuck me.

37:04.721 --> 37:06.306
Could you slow down just a little bit?

37:08.475 --> 37:09.893
What the hell is wrong with you?

37:10.269 --> 37:12.479
Could you slow down?

37:27.160 --> 37:28.996
Come on, Ms. Ellis,
you know I keep it sexy.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.373
-Driving like a bat out of hell.
-Hey, Nicky, you good?

37:32.041 --> 37:32.999
Hey, what are you humps doin'?

37:33.333 --> 37:35.960
You guys wanna go get into something
and help these cats out? Let's go!

37:36.670 --> 37:38.713
Hey, my man, we gonna need that van, okay?

37:38.798 --> 37:41.008
Here's the deal. They're gonna hurt us,
we gonna hurt them worse.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.969
You understand?
That's how it's gon' work today.

37:43.052 --> 37:44.762
-Get out!
-Let's go! Let's get into this fight now.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.807
Let's go, load up!
Let's go. Load the fuck up.

37:50.058 --> 37:53.645
Hold on! Jesus!
Could you wait till I close the door?

38:03.531 --> 38:04.573
Fuck the police!

38:05.616 --> 38:06.908
Fuck the police!

38:08.243 --> 38:10.370
-Fuck the police!
-Fuck the police!

38:41.693 --> 38:43.737
Let's get these injured officers
into the van.

38:44.863 --> 38:45.905
Hey, you good?

38:46.823 --> 38:49.285
-Hey, look. I got you, I got you.
-You're going home. You're going home.

38:51.454 --> 38:52.662
-Head's up.
-Let's load these up, all right?

38:53.204 --> 38:54.540
Hey, keys in the ignition,

38:54.623 --> 38:56.625
we're getting them to the staging area
by the zoo.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.501
Open those doors, get them shields out.

38:58.586 --> 39:01.129
No peace! No justice, no peace!

39:01.213 --> 39:02.340
No justice, no peace!

39:03.006 --> 39:04.591
Let's go! Grab your signs, let's go.

39:05.051 --> 39:10.139
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!

39:10.222 --> 39:15.143
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!

39:16.019 --> 39:17.187
Make some space.

39:17.521 --> 39:21.192
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!

39:21.274 --> 39:22.234
They're just pissed.

39:26.238 --> 39:28.449
Every single one of us
is going home tonight.

39:28.531 --> 39:31.118
You understand? We're going home,
we hold this fuckin' line.

39:35.330 --> 39:37.582
Don't you fucking do it.
Don't you fucking do it.

39:37.957 --> 39:39.167
Don't you fucking do it.

39:39.667 --> 39:41.628
-Go on, man. Go ahead and throw it.
-Watch what happens.

39:42.463 --> 39:44.090
Motherfucker. Come on.

39:47.926 --> 39:49.552
Hold the line! Hold the line!

39:49.637 --> 39:50.846
We'll fucking show you.

39:52.222 --> 39:53.349
Motherfucking...

39:55.225 --> 39:56.893
Stand the fuck back, man. I see you.

39:57.603 --> 39:59.230
Hold this line.
Stop fuckin' throwing shit.

40:01.397 --> 40:03.983
That's right. I'm right here.
I'm right here.

40:04.860 --> 40:06.529
Come on, then. Come on then.

40:06.611 --> 40:08.154
-I can't breathe...
-Do something else!

40:08.238 --> 40:10.032
You're going to fuckin' jail, man.
You understand me?

40:10.116 --> 40:11.991
You're going to fuckin' jail, man.

40:12.076 --> 40:19.041
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

40:19.123 --> 40:26.005
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

40:27.632 --> 40:30.386
The CVS here at North and Penn
was the first to be looted.

40:30.469 --> 40:33.847
Again, this is the scene in Baltimore city
where officers in riot gear

40:33.930 --> 40:35.390
are still arriving.

40:35.473 --> 40:36.809
Trying to contain the crowd...

40:38.476 --> 40:39.854
Commissioner Batts, welcome back.

40:39.937 --> 40:42.898
Deputy Davis, I was on my way
to the airport when the mayor called.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.900
...Followed a smaller group
for a few blocks

40:44.984 --> 40:46.860
and saw several windows smashed.

40:47.443 --> 40:49.655
Thankfully it appears there isn't
a police officer inside...

40:49.738 --> 40:50.823
Sir?

40:50.905 --> 40:52.156
...but if there was...

41:22.770 --> 41:25.940
Hey, major. Are we gonna do anything
about that car?

41:26.024 --> 41:28.109
Sean, fuck that car.

41:28.526 --> 41:30.488
At this point,
it's better to let them blow off steam.

41:33.156 --> 41:35.075
This is fucking bullshit.
The fuck are we doing here,

41:35.159 --> 41:36.619
-watching this shit?
-Fuck y'all.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.765
Got chicken. What's going on, Freddy?

41:58.848 --> 42:00.934
You holding all right?
What's going on, y'all? Let's eat!

42:02.435 --> 42:06.482
The man here just plopped down
600 to feed your faces.

42:06.564 --> 42:07.732
Go on, pass them round.

42:07.816 --> 42:11.070
Don't leave no boxes or crumbs in the car.

42:11.153 --> 42:13.572
Make sure somebody else gets some,
I know you like that dark meat, girl.

42:15.241 --> 42:16.449
Come on, pass that out, y'all.

42:16.532 --> 42:18.201
Hey, make sure you guys
stay hydrated, all right?

42:18.285 --> 42:19.661
Everybody get some water, yeah.
Suck it down.

42:19.744 --> 42:22.705
A few hours ago,
Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's curfew

42:22.789 --> 42:24.874
went into effect across the city.

42:25.251 --> 42:26.710
But the fires still burn.

42:27.211 --> 42:30.839
For West Baltimore activist Danisha,
the curfew is not bringing peace

42:30.923 --> 42:33.467
-nor quiet.
-You can hear the helicopter...

42:53.153 --> 42:55.029
-You want backup, Sarge?
-Nah, I'm good.

42:55.113 --> 42:58.409
Fucking city has going batshit crazy.
Been chasing alarms all night.

42:58.492 --> 43:00.536
Got a 10-31, B and E in progress
at Maryland and Lanvale.

43:00.619 --> 43:03.037
I'mma stay here till this place
gets boarded up. Go and get that.

43:04.331 --> 43:05.291
And stay safe.

43:17.427 --> 43:18.429
Hey!

43:20.472 --> 43:21.515
Anyone else in there?

43:22.057 --> 43:23.058
Just us.

43:23.850 --> 43:25.519
Hey, drop that shit
and get the fuck goin'.

44:42.470 --> 44:44.055
We will fight for Freddie Gray.

44:44.138 --> 44:47.100
All night, all day,
we will fight for Freddie Gray.

44:51.730 --> 44:54.650
No justice, no peace.
No justice, no peace.

44:57.193 --> 44:58.862
All night, all day...

45:09.163 --> 45:10.123
What's goin' on, man?

45:10.791 --> 45:12.042
The fuck's this?

45:14.377 --> 45:16.963
Fucking animals were looting a Rite Aid.

45:17.338 --> 45:18.298
Shit.

45:19.341 --> 45:21.592
We got the entire
fuckin' pharmacy there, man.

45:21.676 --> 45:23.719
Tell you what, I don't even know
what half that shit is, man.

45:25.847 --> 45:28.767
It's fuckin' oxy, man.
It's worth 20 bucks a pop.

45:29.226 --> 45:31.895
Well, shit, good. What you want me to say?
Fucking good for us. God damn.

45:34.647 --> 45:36.649
But what the fuck
am I gonna do with all this?

45:40.070 --> 45:42.823
You'll figure it out. Let's get breakfast.

45:43.741 --> 45:47.243
Lieutenant Rice, Officer Miller,
and Officer Nero

45:47.327 --> 45:49.162
illegally arrested Mr. Gray.

45:49.496 --> 45:53.416
While each of these officers
are presumed innocent until proven guilty,

45:53.499 --> 45:55.836
-we have brought the following charges...
-You believe this fuckin' horseshit?

45:55.918 --> 46:00.048
...Officer Goodson is being charged
with second-degree depraved-heart murder.

46:00.549 --> 46:02.509
-Damn. Murder.
-What? Murder? That's extreme.

46:02.593 --> 46:04.927
-Are you fucking kiddin' me?
-...second-degree negligent assault.

46:05.012 --> 46:07.139
Bro, fucking murder?
What the fuck is that?

46:07.222 --> 46:09.224
-No fucking way, yo. No fucking way.
-You phony fucking bitch.

46:09.308 --> 46:11.810
-You phony fucking bitch. Bullshit.
-It's crazy.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.896
She's out here dishin' out fucking charges

46:13.979 --> 46:15.813
to these police officers
for doin' their job!

46:15.897 --> 46:17.356
-That's all they doin'.
-That's all they did!

46:17.440 --> 46:19.193
-They did their fuckin' job.
-The fuck else we gonna do?

46:19.276 --> 46:22.153
What the fuck is
"second degree depraved-heart murder?"

46:22.528 --> 46:24.865
Hey, why not charge him with fuckin'
mopery if you're makin' bullshit up?

46:26.033 --> 46:27.451
I mean, she loadin' up on the charges.

46:27.534 --> 46:30.788
Even if you pin negligence,
on the fuckin' wagon there,

46:31.121 --> 46:33.332
how the fuck do you come out
with second degree murder?

46:33.415 --> 46:34.624
-Fuckin' murder.
-It's crazy.

46:34.707 --> 46:36.626
-It makes no fuckin' sense.
-And them guys they charged

46:36.709 --> 46:38.378
for makin' the arrest? He ran.

46:38.462 --> 46:40.547
-And they got him with a knife.
-That's what the fuck I'm sayin'.

46:40.631 --> 46:42.381
-That's it
-And now this little fuckin' animal,

46:42.465 --> 46:44.134
they're gonna make him out
to be a fuckin' hero, watch.

46:44.218 --> 46:45.844
That's what they're gonna do,
you hear these people

46:45.928 --> 46:48.305
cheering for this bullshit?
Nobody has a fuckin' idea.

46:48.638 --> 46:50.933
Can you imagine our guys right now?
Seein' these charges?

46:51.642 --> 46:52.934
You know it's gonna fuck 'em up.

46:53.267 --> 46:54.686
Them motherfuckers
ain't gonna wanna work.

46:55.853 --> 46:58.315
I tell you what? Fuck it,
I'm goin' out with city-wide email.

46:58.398 --> 46:59.358
I'm doin' it tonight.

46:59.732 --> 47:01.360
I'm goin' to every fuckin' member
of this department.

47:01.443 --> 47:03.361
I don't care if you're retired or active.

47:03.778 --> 47:05.363
You fuckin' donate.
You're pitchin' the fuck in.

47:05.446 --> 47:06.532
You don't be selfish.

47:06.615 --> 47:08.867
You don't be judgmental.
You pitch the fuck in.

47:08.950 --> 47:10.618
We're goin' to have an answer
for this bullshit.

47:10.702 --> 47:12.245
You wanna help
your brothers and sisters in blue?

47:12.329 --> 47:14.581
You do it fuckin' now.
We fuckin' answer to this.

47:15.790 --> 47:16.749
Bullshit.

47:17.584 --> 47:19.377
Like I said,
there's more than one Wayne Jenkins.

47:22.422 --> 47:24.590
-So, what's next?
-According to Mr. Ward's list

47:25.551 --> 47:27.052
the robbery on Heathfield Road.

47:27.885 --> 47:28.844
Go ahead.

47:29.762 --> 47:32.014
So, it was Sergeant Jenkins,

47:32.390 --> 47:34.016
Taylor, Hendrix, and me,

47:35.059 --> 47:38.564
and Sergeant Jenkins is drivin'
the wrong way down Jonquil Avenue

47:38.646 --> 47:41.191
when he spots this guy, Brown,
getting into a mini-van.

47:41.567 --> 47:45.279
Now, Jenkins had this thing
about anybody over, like, 18,

47:45.362 --> 47:46.570
carrying a bookbag.

47:46.654 --> 47:48.739
He figured they were concealin' drugs
or weapons.

47:49.115 --> 47:51.451
Now, this one started off
like our usual takedowns, but...

47:53.869 --> 47:55.496
man, then it just went of the chain.

47:57.957 --> 47:59.542
-Shit, what the fuck, man?
-Hands!

48:00.084 --> 48:02.253
-Put your hands of the fuckin' wheel.
-Put your hands on the steering wheel.

48:02.712 --> 48:04.089
Put your hands
on the fuckin' steering wheel.

48:05.173 --> 48:07.341
-It's all right. I'm sorry, dude.
-Why you come in so fuckin' hot, man?

48:07.425 --> 48:08.594
I wouldn't worry about all that.

48:09.344 --> 48:10.721
You got something on you, player?

48:10.804 --> 48:13.390
-Half a key of coke.
-Oh, look. You a baller, huh?

48:16.142 --> 48:17.768
How much money was recovered?

48:18.562 --> 48:21.857
Twenty-one-five.
But we only submitted 15 thou.

48:21.939 --> 48:24.401
I think Sergeant Jenkins took 6,500
off the top.

48:24.483 --> 48:25.651
Then what happened?

48:25.735 --> 48:27.653
Then Sergeant Jenkins
told the two suspects

48:27.737 --> 48:30.032
he was a federal agent,
just like he did at the BT.

48:30.740 --> 48:32.450
And he told us

48:32.533 --> 48:34.452
Stevenson probably had
a lot more cash and coke.

48:34.535 --> 48:37.873
so he had dispatch run Stevenson
through the watch center,

48:38.457 --> 48:42.335
and they came up with an address
for the man's house up on Heathfield.

48:43.128 --> 48:44.671
So we tossed the house.

48:45.880 --> 48:46.840
Down in the basement,

48:47.174 --> 48:48.549
Jenkins hits the jackpot.

48:48.884 --> 48:49.968
Down here!

48:50.760 --> 48:52.971
My man. When was the last time you seen
one of those, huh?

48:53.346 --> 48:54.514
Oh, man.

49:05.733 --> 49:07.527
-What you got?
-Hey, come look out for yourself.

49:08.111 --> 49:09.655
You just know there's money up
in that bitch.

49:10.488 --> 49:11.447
Hella money.

49:12.908 --> 49:15.117
All right, Mo, you stay here.
You two, with me.

49:15.911 --> 49:17.870
-Where you goin'?
-We're gonna go get a warrant.

49:18.412 --> 49:19.372
Copy.

49:22.793 --> 49:24.294
Ain't this some shit.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.712
So they left me to guard the house

49:26.797 --> 49:29.466
and they're taking a while,
I'm startin' to get nervous.

49:29.549 --> 49:31.759
And I hear females come into the house.

49:32.426 --> 49:34.096
It was Stevenson's wife and her sister.

49:35.222 --> 49:36.848
And I advised them
as to what was going on,

49:36.932 --> 49:38.767
but the wife started actin' a fool.

49:38.850 --> 49:39.810
So I called Jenkins

49:40.519 --> 49:43.270
and he says he'll send Taylor back
and I was to call a marked unit.

49:44.022 --> 49:47.192
The uniform arrives, the females,
they settle down in the livin' room.

49:49.277 --> 49:50.904
So, this must've gone on for hours.

49:52.071 --> 49:53.280
Yeah, it was like a couple hours

49:53.365 --> 49:55.825
before Hendrix and Jenkins
finally showed up.

49:56.784 --> 49:59.162
And that's when they brought
the prybar and the ram.

50:07.378 --> 50:08.714
That shit popped.
Let's go, let's get it.

50:10.173 --> 50:11.341
Oh, fuck yeah.

50:11.424 --> 50:12.759
Holy shit.

50:12.843 --> 50:15.177
Fuck I tell ya? I told you Reese
was a big dog, right?

50:15.512 --> 50:16.762
The fuck I say?

50:16.847 --> 50:18.347
How much he say
was supposed to be in there?

50:18.432 --> 50:19.390
Hundred. Hundred thousand.

50:19.932 --> 50:21.727
That's a lot fuckin' more
than a hundred thou.

50:21.809 --> 50:23.894
Bet your ass, all right, let's go.
Let's get it out and count it.

50:24.395 --> 50:26.147
All right, let's go. Get it all out.

50:26.480 --> 50:27.983
Get it all out on the floor right there.

50:30.485 --> 50:31.653
I'd say there's about 10 Gs

50:31.735 --> 50:33.155
in each one of those stacks,
that seem right?

50:33.487 --> 50:35.406
-Same here.
-Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

50:35.489 --> 50:37.074
You count out ten of those piles,

50:37.159 --> 50:40.287
100,000 dollars, that goes in the safe.
All right? We're gonna shut that shit up.

50:40.912 --> 50:42.246
Everything else goes in the duffle bag.

50:42.329 --> 50:43.957
Okay? Right in that fuckin' duffle bag.

50:44.041 --> 50:45.083
Let's make it happen, let's go.

50:45.875 --> 50:46.834
Come on.

50:48.128 --> 50:49.171
Duffle bag, by the car.

50:52.340 --> 50:53.674
Got ten right here.

50:59.346 --> 51:03.058
All right, let me tell you...
tell you what we gonna do, okay?

51:03.935 --> 51:05.896
In case Stevenson makes
a little bitch-ass complaint,

51:06.563 --> 51:08.814
we gotta cover our ass, all right?
You take out your camera phone.

51:09.273 --> 51:10.776
Okay?
We gonna video this whole fuckin' thing.

51:10.858 --> 51:12.485
We gotta make a movie. You understand?

51:12.819 --> 51:14.362
You gonna pry that bitch open again.

51:14.445 --> 51:16.281
Do it the same fuckin' way.
You're gonna hit that bitch

51:16.364 --> 51:18.657
and you're gonna pry it. All right?
When it opens, you say,

51:18.741 --> 51:20.201
"Oh my God. Holy shit," all that.

51:20.284 --> 51:21.827
Believe in what the fuck you're saying,
all right?

51:21.911 --> 51:25.207
I'm gonna be upstairs.
You guys call for me when that shit opens.

51:25.290 --> 51:27.459
You make sure you get everything
on camera, you understand?

51:27.541 --> 51:29.126
-Everything. See the whole fuckin' world.
-Yes, Sarge.

51:29.210 --> 51:30.462
-You got it? All right...
-You got it.

51:30.545 --> 51:32.922
...let's go motherfuckers. Listen,
make sure you start at the same time.

51:33.006 --> 51:36.259
What's the shit that movie assholes say?
Fuckin' action. Right?

51:36.342 --> 51:38.427
Say, "action" then start.
Don't say "action" on camera.

51:38.511 --> 51:39.553
Where is my husband?

51:39.637 --> 51:41.180
Make sure you're on the same fuckin' page.

51:42.891 --> 51:44.559
-Do you have a warrant?
-Bro, what the fuck?

51:44.643 --> 51:46.728
-Ma'am, could you please listen to him...
-Are we really about to do this?

51:47.771 --> 51:50.732
-Y'all ready?
-Yeah, man. We got to.

51:50.816 --> 51:51.817
All right, back up.

51:52.691 --> 51:53.985
-Come on.
-Come on, let's go.

51:54.361 --> 51:55.570
-You ready?
-Yeah.

52:01.159 --> 52:02.117
I think I'm close.

52:03.494 --> 52:04.996
We almost got it open, Sarge.

52:08.125 --> 52:10.085
Oh, my God. Holy shit.

52:10.459 --> 52:12.087
All right,
somebody get a flashlight on it.

52:12.170 --> 52:13.963
-Jesus.
-Back off. Everybody stay the fuck away

52:14.046 --> 52:15.215
and just put a flashlight on it.

52:15.548 --> 52:17.007
Is there more than 5,000 dollars
in there?

52:18.343 --> 52:20.719
-Yes, sir.
-Okay. I gotta call the feds.

52:21.178 --> 52:23.223
Any time you get a seizure
of over 5,000 dollars,

52:23.305 --> 52:25.267
you gotta call the high-intensity drug
trafficking area agents.

52:25.600 --> 52:26.976
Excellent work, gentlemen.

52:29.186 --> 52:30.563
Just another seizure by the books.

52:31.814 --> 52:36.153
Sergeant Jenkins gave Hendrix,
Taylor, and me twenty thou each,

52:37.070 --> 52:38.070
and he kept the rest.

52:43.200 --> 52:45.160
Did he get 20,000?

52:45.244 --> 52:46.621
No, it was a lot more.

52:47.622 --> 52:51.168
Did anyone have a problem with him
getting more than the rest of you?

52:52.794 --> 52:54.421
No, he was Wayne Jenkins.

52:54.504 --> 52:56.797
He was the one who could see something
goin' down on the street

52:57.172 --> 52:58.466
and put all the pieces together.

52:59.551 --> 53:03.263
I mean, just drivin' down Jonquil Avenue
the wrong way, smart.

53:04.471 --> 53:07.309
And from that, we knocked off a big dog.

53:09.226 --> 53:10.687
So what did you do with the money?

53:12.689 --> 53:14.316
On my way home, I had time to think.

53:16.984 --> 53:19.737
I parked my car outside my house
and I took a walk.

53:36.378 --> 53:37.880
So you want us to believe

53:37.963 --> 53:39.965
that you tossed away your 20,000 dollars?

53:40.884 --> 53:41.968
Crazy, right?

53:42.886 --> 53:44.012
If it wasn't about the money...

53:45.055 --> 53:46.680
I wanted to get in with these guys.

53:46.764 --> 53:48.307
You know, you don't wanna be black-balled.

53:49.184 --> 53:50.685
You don't want them to think you a snitch.

53:51.770 --> 53:52.729
Right? So...

53:53.562 --> 53:57.525
And to be truthful, if I thought I could
take that money and not get caught,

53:57.609 --> 53:58.652
I probably would've kept it.

53:59.193 --> 54:01.987
But I didn't wanna bring that money
in my house and jeopardize my family.

54:04.658 --> 54:05.616
Bad outweighed the good.

54:12.414 --> 54:13.999
Shit. I'm an idiot.

54:15.417 --> 54:19.297
Last spring, if McDougal
and Kilpatrick hadn't flagged it,

54:20.089 --> 54:23.510
I was about to warn Jenkins
his squad was under investigation.

54:24.135 --> 54:26.137
And I could've fucked up this entire case.

54:27.471 --> 54:28.472
But you didn't.

54:31.434 --> 54:32.601
You don't even fucking wanna know.

54:33.520 --> 54:35.981
Then they came through with that...
Remember they came through

54:36.064 --> 54:37.232
with all that slash day bullshit, right?

54:37.773 --> 54:40.609
You know, push to get guns off the street.
We gonna give you a slash day

54:40.694 --> 54:42.069
for every gun you get.

54:42.152 --> 54:43.989
That didn't do shit. I mean, day off,

54:44.406 --> 54:45.739
that don't put money in your pocket.

54:45.823 --> 54:47.825
That don't fuckin' incentivize nobody,
right?

54:48.242 --> 54:50.120
So then the murder rate
starts to go crazy again.

54:50.203 --> 54:52.538
Everybody's fucking head
gets all fucked up, right?

54:52.622 --> 54:55.541
And they finally figured it out.
Let's turn on that overtime speed.

54:56.083 --> 54:58.003
Look, I don't know about you guys,
but over in S.E.S.

54:58.545 --> 54:59.753
What were we doing?

54:59.837 --> 55:01.964
-Putting in work. Grinding.
-Straight up. Straight the fuck up.

55:02.048 --> 55:04.092
Grinding.
What are we doing this for, right?

55:04.175 --> 55:06.468
-Money.
-That's right. That's fuckin' right.

55:06.552 --> 55:10.180
Fuck yeah. How about you just...
Tell 'em what you did.

55:10.264 --> 55:11.599
You know, last year, base.

55:12.766 --> 55:14.602
Like 72, 73 thou.

55:14.686 --> 55:16.146
Tell 'em what you made on overtime.

55:17.563 --> 55:18.605
Sixty-two.

55:19.648 --> 55:20.691
You got me beat.

55:21.943 --> 55:25.279
-Oh, shit, I only made 29.
-'Cause you don't do shit.

55:25.946 --> 55:26.989
Nigga, shut your...

55:27.073 --> 55:29.326
My base last year was 85
and my overtime was 83.

55:30.576 --> 55:32.202
Yeah, you heard that right.

55:32.287 --> 55:33.997
I don't know
if y'all are fuckin' math wizards,

55:34.079 --> 55:35.789
but I'll tell you right now,
that's 170,000.

55:35.873 --> 55:37.042
That ain't fuckin' bad for a sergeant

55:37.125 --> 55:38.417
-doing day work, right?
-Hell no.

55:38.501 --> 55:41.629
And now look. They just handed me
the gun-trace taskforce, right?

55:42.045 --> 55:43.672
Made my ass citywide, right?

55:43.757 --> 55:45.383
Great, and it's awesome, right?

55:45.467 --> 55:47.259
But you gotta ask yourself
why did they do that?

55:47.594 --> 55:49.554
See, these bosses,
they think I'm the golden boy.

55:49.971 --> 55:52.014
They think Wayne Jenkins can do no wrong.

55:52.098 --> 55:54.057
I mean, Mosby, she jams these guys up.

55:54.142 --> 55:55.601
What's goin' on
in this department right now?

55:55.684 --> 55:57.937
There's a work slowdown across
the entire fuckin' thing.

55:58.021 --> 56:00.898
But we were out there in the S.E.S,
we were fuckin' kickin' ass right?

56:00.982 --> 56:02.816
-Fucking right.
-We're puttin' in work, gettin' guns.

56:03.442 --> 56:05.820
Commissioner Davis comes up to me
and he says, "Well, how do you do it?'

56:06.363 --> 56:09.072
"How do you keep your men motivated
in an environment like this?"

56:09.156 --> 56:10.240
I say, "It's easy, sir."

56:10.325 --> 56:12.159
"It's just one little word
and that word's 'overtime.'"

56:12.659 --> 56:15.538
He said, "Cool. Shit.
Keep up the good work, son."

56:15.622 --> 56:16.872
That's what he said.
Well, you know something?

56:17.456 --> 56:20.418
That's exactly what the fuck we gonna do.
We gonna keep up that good work.

56:21.001 --> 56:22.669
So, starting tomorrow,
we gonna work eight to four,

56:22.753 --> 56:23.837
but we ain't comin' in till two.

56:25.423 --> 56:27.424
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Shit, I like that.

56:27.883 --> 56:29.719
But when we do come in, we come correct.

56:30.136 --> 56:32.513
We go proactive as a motherfucker.
You understand me?

56:32.596 --> 56:34.223
We go, and we come to fuckin' hunt.

56:34.307 --> 56:36.308
We go get those guns, you understand?

56:36.393 --> 56:38.393
'Cause as long as we do that,
as long as we produce,

56:38.811 --> 56:40.105
as long as we put those numbers up,

56:40.188 --> 56:42.148
they don't fucking give a shit
about what we do.

56:42.649 --> 56:44.525
We literally can do
whatever the fuck we want.

56:44.608 --> 56:45.609
You understand me?

56:49.114 --> 56:50.115
We own this city.

56:52.950 --> 56:54.119
We own it.

56:54.202 --> 56:56.995
-Aye, I'm with that shit. Hit me, nigga.
-Yeah. Yeah.

56:57.079 --> 56:58.456
-Fuck yeah.
-Dope.

56:59.833 --> 57:01.250
Sounds like
you runnin' for something, Jenkins.

57:03.418 --> 57:06.172
He tryna be the mayor or some shit?
I'm just sayin'.
