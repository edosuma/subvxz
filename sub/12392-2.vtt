13 YEARS IN THE MAKING.

00:17.310 --> 00:19.414
EVERYTHING HAS TO GO PERFECT LY.

00:19.450 --> 00:20.269
WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

00:20.320 --> 00:22.288
IS YOUR SUPPORT
AND YOUR COOPERATION.

00:22.320 --> 00:23.548
NOT YOUR SARCASM

00:23.590 --> 00:24.716
OKAY, BUDDY.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.251

00:26.290 --> 00:27.484

00:27.520 --> 00:28.748
WHERE'S YOUR GRAD PIC?

00:28.790 --> 00:30.280
OH, YEAH,

00:30.330 --> 00:31.752

DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

00:31.790 --> 00:32.757
YOU KNOW THAT WAS MY THING.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.153
INSTEAD OF NAME TAGS,

00:34.200 --> 00:35.155
WE'LL KNOW WHO EVERYONE IS

00:35.200 --> 00:36.224

00:36.270 --> 00:38.124
GREAT IDEA, RIGHT?

00:38.170 --> 00:39.489
IS IT MOCK TIME YET?

00:39.540 --> 00:41.064
JUST PUT IT ON, SHAWN.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.408

00:45.770 --> 00:47.408
SHAWN, THAT ISN'T YOU,

00:47.440 --> 00:48.407
NO, IT ISN'T.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.407
IT'S JUDD NELSON, ISN'T IT?

00:49.450 --> 00:50.542

OH, YEAH.

01:20.340 --> 01:21.329

01:23.410 --> 01:25.275
I SHOULD--
SHOULD SAY HELLO.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.511
ABIGAIL LYTAR.

01:31.550 --> 01:34.451
JUDD NELSON.

01:34.490 --> 01:35.479
IN THE FLESH.

01:35.520 --> 01:38.489
I LOVED YOU IN FROM THE HIP.

01:38.530 --> 01:40.122
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.696
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE THOSE
WHO BELIEVE

01:41.730 --> 01:43.493
I FLARED MY NOSTRILS
TOO MUCH IN THAT FILM.

01:43.530 --> 01:44.428
OH, NO.

01:44.470 --> 01:46.529
I MEAN, HOW ELSE
COULD WE HAVE POSSIBLY KNOWN

01:46.570 --> 01:48.299
HOW [inhales]
ANGST-RIDDEN YOU WERE?

01:48.340 --> 01:49.637
I AGREE.

01:49.670 --> 01:52.377
SO...

01:52.410 --> 01:54.674

SHAWN.

01:56.210 --> 01:57.472
HELLO, ABIGAIL.

01:57.510 --> 01:59.148
HI.

01:59.180 --> 02:00.738
I NEED YOU TO GO
TO THE CAFETERIA

02:00.780 --> 02:01.872
AND GRAB ANOTHER STACK
OF FOLDING CHAIRS FOR ME.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.182
WE'RE ALREADY SHORT.

02:03.220 --> 02:04.346
CONSIDER IT DONE.

02:04.390 --> 02:05.584
ONE PROBLEM:
WHERE'S THE CAFETERIA?

02:05.620 --> 02:06.917
DID YOU EVEN ATTEND THIS SCHOOL?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.313
JUST GRAB THE CHAIRS.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.657
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
I'M GOING.

02:09.690 --> 02:11.578
MAYBE ABIGAIL COULD HELP YOU.

02:11.630 --> 02:12.597
I LIKE THAT.

02:12.630 --> 02:15.451
I LIKE THAT VERY MUCH.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.789
YOU REALLY DON'T REMEMBER

02:21.840 --> 02:24.263
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US
IN HIGH SCHOOL, DO YOU?

02:24.310 --> 02:26.369
STERN'S WHARF SENIOR YEAR.

02:26.410 --> 02:27.934
THE CARNIVAL ON THE PIER.

02:27.980 --> 02:30.642
YOU PURSUED ME, LIKE,
EVERY DAY OF SENIOR YEAR.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.910
AND THEN I FINALLY AGREED
TO GO OUT WITH YOU,

02:32.950 --> 02:35.578
AND THEN YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP.

02:35.620 --> 02:38.339
I...UH, YEAH.

02:38.390 --> 02:39.516
YES.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.209
HERE'S THE THING, ABIGAIL.

02:41.260 --> 02:42.488
AND NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE
KNOW THIS.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.181
I WAS ACTUALLY WORKING
AS A MIDWIFE BACK THEN.

02:45.230 --> 02:46.128
FAMILY BUSINESS.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.491
AND I GOT A CALL
FROM A CLIENT LATE AT NIGHT

02:47.530 --> 02:49.293
GOING INTO LABOR.

02:49.330 --> 02:50.968
34 HOURS.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.262
THAT'S A LOT OF SCREAMING,
FAIR AMOUNT OF PUSHING,

02:52.300 --> 02:54.234
SOME DILATION, TONGS.

02:54.270 --> 02:55.897
OH, I CAN SEE
WHERE IT WOULDN'T

02:55.940 --> 02:56.759
HAVE OCCURRED TO YOU
TO CALL ME.

02:56.810 --> 02:57.936
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT WAS 13 YEARS AGO.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.278
HARDLY MATTERS NOW.

02:59.310 --> 03:00.629
EXACTLY IS WHAT I'M SAYING.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.772
IT'S LIKE FOREVER AGO.

03:01.810 --> 03:03.402
WE'RE ADULTS NOW,
DOING ADULT THINGS.

03:03.450 --> 03:06.248
AND YOU'RE A TEACHER.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.315
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

03:07.350 --> 03:08.669
OR ARE YOU STILL
IN MIDWIFERY?

03:08.720 --> 03:10.540
NO, NO.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.956
I'VE DABBLED IN QUITE
A FEW THINGS, ACTUALLY.

03:12.990 --> 03:16.289
BUT I LANDED QUITE NICELY
ON PSYCHIC DETECTIVE.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.957
[laughs]

03:17.990 --> 03:20.356
THAT'S FOR REAL.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.427
WHO WOULD ACTUALLY CHOOSE
TO BE A PSYCHIC?

03:24.470 --> 03:25.994
FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S A GIFT.

03:26.030 --> 03:27.395
IT'S NOT A CHOICE.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.237
AND I HAPPEN TO BE
VERY, VERY GOOD AT IT.

03:29.270 --> 03:30.532
[stifles laughter]

03:30.570 --> 03:31.867
I SOLVE CRIMES

03:31.910 --> 03:33.707

POLICE DEPARTMENT.

03:33.740 --> 03:35.002
IT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.008
YOU SOLVE CRIMES?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.802
ALL THE TIME.

03:38.850 --> 03:40.010
[chuckling]

03:40.050 --> 03:42.018
OKAY, WELL, YOU BE SURE
TO LET ME KNOW

03:42.050 --> 03:44.541
IF YOU SENSE THAT, YOU KNOW,
SOMEONE HERE AT THE REUNION

03:44.590 --> 03:46.558
IS GONNA STEAL MY LUNCH MONEY.

03:46.590 --> 03:47.750
[laughs]

03:47.790 --> 03:48.814
THAT'S VERY CLEVER.

03:54.960 --> 03:55.995
DID YOU SEE THAT?

03:56.030 --> 03:58.863
WHAT, IS SOMEONE GETTING
THEIR LUNCH MONEY STOLEN?

03:58.900 --> 04:03.269
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT
BIGGER THAN THAT.

04:29.900 --> 04:32.698

04:39.710 --> 04:41.678
ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME
ON PURPOSE?

04:41.710 --> 04:43.348

OF FOUL PLAY

04:43.380 --> 04:44.540

07:51.100 --> 07:52.988
ISN'T THAT THE GIRL
WHO STUFFED BOBBY COBE'ITS

07:53.040 --> 07:53.995
IN HIS OWN CAR TRUNK
WHEN HE WOULDN'T KISS HER

07:54.040 --> 07:55.132
AT THE SPRING FLING?

07:55.170 --> 07:56.569
WE MET AT THE SANTA BARBARA BOWL

07:56.610 --> 07:57.565
AT THE RAVI SHANKAR CONCERT

07:57.610 --> 07:58.804
LAST WEEK,

07:58.840 --> 08:00.808
AND SHE ASKED ME OUT
ON A DATE.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.102
WHO GOES
TO SOMEONE ELSE'S REUNION

08:02.140 --> 08:02.902
WHEN THEY BARELY EVEN KNOW THEM?

08:02.950 --> 08:05.077
WHO GOES
TO A RAVI SHANKAR CONCERT?

08:05.110 --> 08:06.202
LOOK, I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS A REUNION

08:06.250 --> 08:07.615
UNTIL I SHOWED UP.

08:07.650 --> 08:09.584
BUT WE HAVE
A VERY DEEP CONNECTION.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.781
SAME CONNECTION YOU HAVE
WITH THE SITAR.

08:11.820 --> 08:13.879
WHERE'S MY PUNCH, COREY?

08:13.920 --> 08:16.753
YEAH, WHERE'S HER PUNCH,
COREY?

08:16.790 --> 08:18.758
HELLO, MINDY.
YOU LOOK...NICE.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.098
OH, GIVE IT UP,
BU'ITON-UP.

08:20.130 --> 08:22.052
I ALREADY HAVE A DATE
TO THIS THING.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.692
MINDY, IT'S OFFICIAL.

08:23.730 --> 08:25.664
YOU'VE WON
BITCHIEST BANANA.

08:25.700 --> 08:26.860
AND NOW I AM GOING

08:26.900 --> 08:28.037
TO BORROW DETECTIVE LASSITER

08:28.070 --> 08:29.606
FOR AS LONG AS I'D LIKE.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.301
DETEC--

08:31.340 --> 08:32.807
WAIT, HE'S A COP?

08:32.840 --> 08:34.808
ALL RIGHT,
I HAVE TO BE DISCREET.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.979
GUS HAS A VERY WEAK CONSTITUTION
FOR THESE SORT OF THINGS.

08:37.010 --> 08:38.875
I WITNESSED A MURDER HERE
TONIGHT.

08:38.910 --> 08:39.808
WHAT?
WHO?

08:39.850 --> 08:40.976
I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.078
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

08:42.120 --> 08:43.815
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SEE
ANYTHING.

08:43.850 --> 08:45.989
I PSYCHICALLY WITNESSED IT
WITH MY THIRD EYE.

08:46.020 --> 08:47.612
WHERE'S THE BODY?

08:47.660 --> 08:48.752
THERE'S NOT ONE.

08:48.790 --> 08:49.688
LISTEN UP.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.651
LET ME IMPART TO YOU
A LITTLE POLICE WISDOM

08:50.690 --> 08:53.124
WE LIKE TO THROW AROUND
DOWN AT THE STATION.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.752
NO BODY, NO CRIME.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.949
WHAT, DO YOU GUYS PUT THAT
ON A T-SHIRT?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.922
FINE.
WHO DID IT AND WHY?

08:57.970 --> 08:59.858
I DON'T KNOW, BUT...

08:59.900 --> 09:00.867
I DON'T KNOW.

09:00.900 --> 09:01.867
DO YOU HAVE A MURDER WEAPON?

09:01.900 --> 09:02.867
NO.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.832
WELL, THEN GOOD NIGHT,
SPENCER.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.236
GUS.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.202
THIS SO-CALLED FOOTBALL TEAM
OF OURS,

09:11.250 --> 09:12.069
WERE WE ANY GOOD?

09:12.110 --> 09:15.614
YES, WE WON STATE CHAMP
OUR SENIOR YEAR.

09:15.650 --> 09:16.947
SERIOUSLY, YOU DIDN'T GO
TO ANY OF THE GAMES?

09:16.990 --> 09:18.719
THE GAMES WERE ON FRIDAYS.

09:18.750 --> 09:19.819
THAT WOULD MEAN MISSING
STEP BY STEP.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.157
BUT THIS WINNING STATE,

09:21.190 --> 09:23.829
WOULD THAT GET YOU
SOME SORT OF SPECIAL PIN?

09:23.860 --> 09:26.226
YES, SHAWN.
THE STATE CHAMPS PIN.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.367
I GOT IT.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.833
LASSIE, I KNOW WHO
THE MURDER VICTIM IS.

09:39.880 --> 09:40.869
WHO?

09:40.910 --> 09:43.902
CLASS OF '95,
SABERCATS' STARTING QUARTERBACK

09:43.950 --> 09:47.841
[imitates sports announcer]
HOWIE TOLKIN!

09:49.790 --> 09:50.745
SHAWN.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.815
WHAT?

09:58.990 --> 10:00.150
HOWIE.

10:04.070 --> 10:08.962
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.308
LOOK, JULES,

10:10.340 --> 10:12.706
JUST GET DOWN HERE
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

10:12.740 --> 10:14.298
I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP
ON THIS CASE.

10:14.340 --> 10:16.376
IT'S INTENSE.

10:16.410 --> 10:19.174
I WILL FILL YOU IN
ON THE REST WHEN YOU GET HERE.

10:19.210 --> 10:21.371
THANK YOU.

10:21.420 --> 10:22.648
[phone claps shut]

10:22.690 --> 10:25.318
SO CARL,

10:25.350 --> 10:26.419
THIS IS MY EX-BOYFRIEND

10:26.450 --> 10:28.782
FROM HIGH SCHOOL
ALL FOUR YEARS,

10:28.820 --> 10:30.219
ELDON.

10:30.260 --> 10:31.659
NICE TO MEET YOU, BUDDY.

10:31.690 --> 10:32.657
(Mindy)
YEAH.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.123
[sighs]

10:35.160 --> 10:36.422
[clears throat]
RIGHT.

10:36.460 --> 10:37.427
AND THIS IS HIS, UH,

10:37.470 --> 10:39.995
HIS BRAND-NEW WIFE,
STEPHANIE.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.792
YEAH.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.707
SO, UM, I'M DATING
A COP NOW.

10:44.740 --> 10:46.879
[chuckles]
OH, REALLY?

10:46.910 --> 10:48.207
YEAH.

10:48.240 --> 10:50.105
YOU EVER, UM, SHOOT ANYBODY?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.004
WELL, I DON'T--
OF COURSE HE HAS.

10:52.050 --> 10:53.449
PROBABLY A BUNCH
OF PEOPLE.

10:53.480 --> 10:54.845
A BUNCH?

10:54.880 --> 10:56.814
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WHAT IS A BUNCH REALLY?

10:56.850 --> 10:58.010
1--
[coughs]

10:58.050 --> 10:59.119
YES.

10:59.150 --> 10:59.957
WOMEN.

10:59.990 --> 11:02.879
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
BUT HEARTACHE, MAN.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.727
ALL THEY WANT
IS A RING, MAN.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.455
THEY WON'T STOP
TILL THEY GET THE RING.

11:06.490 --> 11:09.095
DUDE, I COULD NOT HAVE SAID IT
BE'ITER MYSELF.

11:09.130 --> 11:11.769
MAYBE CLEARER,
BUT I AGREE.

11:11.800 --> 11:12.767
I'M JUST LIKE YOU GUYS.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.689
I--I HOPE TO KISS ONE...
SOMEDAY.

11:15.740 --> 11:17.469
EXACTLY.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.738
YOU KNOW, DUDE,
YOU'RE JUST LIKE US.

11:18.770 --> 11:20.806
MARGINALLY EMPLOYED,

11:20.840 --> 11:21.807
SINGLE, NEVER BEEN MARRIED.

11:21.840 --> 11:22.772
I MEAN, YOU GET IT.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.208
DID YOU GUYS SEE SOMEONE
TAMPERING WITH THIS CASE?

11:31.250 --> 11:32.854
NO, BUT I WISH I'D THOUGHT
OF THAT.

11:32.890 --> 11:34.778
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE
THAT TOLKIN GUY GO DOWN.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.082
HE TERRORIZED ME
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.326
THEY BUILD A SHRINE
FOR HIM

11:37.360 --> 11:38.384
'CAUSE HE CAN THROW A FOOTBALL?

11:38.430 --> 11:39.385
PSHH.
WHO CARES?

11:39.430 --> 11:40.419
EXACTLY.

11:40.460 --> 11:43.429
HEY, WHY DON'T THEY BUILD
A SHRINE TO MY BU'IT?

11:43.470 --> 11:45.927
[laughing]

11:45.970 --> 11:47.460
THERE YOU ARE!

11:47.500 --> 11:48.762
I'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER
FOR YOU.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.267
DUDE, YOU TOTALLY LIED
TO US.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.868
YOU HAVE A GIRL,
AND SHE IS HOT.

11:51.910 --> 11:54.731
EXCUSE US, DUDES.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.099
OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

11:56.140 --> 11:57.107
WHAT?

11:57.150 --> 11:58.469
YOU SAID YOU WERE ON A CASE

11:58.510 --> 11:59.477
AND THERE WERE POSSIBLE
CRIMINAL SUSPECT S DOWN HERE

11:59.510 --> 12:01.478
THAT MIGHT GET SPOOKED
BY COPS SNIFFING AROUND.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.509
YEAH, BUT WHAT
ARE YOU WEARING?

12:02.550 --> 12:03.847
THIS IS A REUNION,
NOT THE PROM.

12:03.890 --> 12:04.481
I NEED YOU TO FIT IN.

12:04.520 --> 12:05.919
WHAT, THIS?

12:05.950 --> 12:07.212
THIS ISN'T A PROM DRESS.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.215
IT LOOKS LIKE A PROM DRESS.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.386
IT'S A LI'ITLE...POOFY.

12:09.420 --> 12:10.819
IT DOESN'T POOF.
THERE'S NO POOF.

12:10.860 --> 12:11.986
A SLIGHT POOF.

12:12.030 --> 12:13.349
LOOK, IT'S WHAT
I WAS GONNA WEAR

12:13.400 --> 12:14.856
TO MY HIGH SCHOOL REUNION
THAT I COULDN'T GO TO

12:14.900 --> 12:16.128
BECAUSE I WAS ON A CASE.
JULES--

12:16.160 --> 12:17.263
JUST SHOW ME WHERE
THESE SUSPECT S ARE

12:17.300 --> 12:18.392
THAT I NEED TO VET.

12:18.430 --> 12:19.465
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NEED
TO "VET" ANYTHING.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.489
THE ANIMALS ARE FINE.

12:20.540 --> 12:21.859
BUT LET'S POOF ON OVER,

12:21.900 --> 12:22.867
AND I'LL POINT 'EM OUT
TO YOU.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.901
OH, THANKS FOR PLAYING UP

12:24.940 --> 12:26.532
THAT WHOLE TOUGH GUY
COP THING,

12:26.570 --> 12:27.798
YOU KNOW, WITH ELDON.

12:27.840 --> 12:28.636
THAT WAS REALLY NICE
OF YOU.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.079
I THINK
THE "I'M PACKING HEAT" THING

12:30.110 --> 12:31.202
WAS A LITTLE OVERBOARD,

12:31.250 --> 12:32.239
BUT HE SEEMED TO BUY IT,
SO...

12:32.280 --> 12:34.214
BUT I AM PACKING HEAT.

12:34.250 --> 12:35.217
[laughs]

12:35.250 --> 12:36.512
OH, THAT'S CUTE.

12:36.550 --> 12:37.812
WHAT, DO YOU SQUEEZE
THE TRIGGER

12:37.850 --> 12:38.680
AND A LITTLE PEN COMES OUT

12:38.720 --> 12:39.880
SO YOU CAN WRITE PEOPLE
PARKING TICKETS?

12:39.920 --> 12:41.456
UM, BARNABY JONES,

12:41.490 --> 12:44.527
WHY DON'T YOU HOLD MY PURSE
WHILE I GO DANCE.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.790
I CALLED YOU
BECAUSE I NEED YOUR HELP.

12:46.830 --> 12:50.197
OH, MY GOD!
IT'S HOWIE AND EILEEN!

12:50.230 --> 12:53.233
ABE FROMAN,
SAUSAGE KING OF CHICAGO.

12:53.270 --> 12:55.238
YES!

12:55.270 --> 12:57.261
WE ALL SPENT OUR WONDER YEARS
TOGETHER.
RIGHT.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.937
YOU GUYS LOOK GREAT.

12:58.970 --> 13:00.073
ESPECIALLY YOU.

13:00.110 --> 13:02.101
I WANT YOU BA'ITIN' CLEAN-UP,

13:03.310 --> 13:03.969
LOOK AT THAT PACKAGE,
HUH?

13:05.550 --> 13:07.074
I--I DON'T MEAN
TO BE A DOWNER, GUYS,

13:07.120 --> 13:09.213
BUT DID YOU KNOW
THAT SOMEBODY TAMPERED

13:09.250 --> 13:10.581
WITH YOUR FOOTBALL SHRINE?

13:10.620 --> 13:11.882
OH, DUDE, SERIOUSLY,

13:11.920 --> 13:12.784
THAT'S JUST OLD HIGH SCHOOL
STUFF.

13:12.820 --> 13:13.855
I DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT THAT ANYMORE.

13:13.890 --> 13:17.121
I'M ACTUALLY ON
TO MUCH BIGGER STUFF NOW, SO.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.855
HOWIE JUST ANNOUNCED
HIS CANDIDACY

13:18.890 --> 13:20.096
FOR STATE ASSEMBLY
LAST MONTH.

13:20.130 --> 13:21.552
YEAH, DUDE.
I CARE ABOUT THE ISSUES

13:21.600 --> 13:23.192
I ACTUALLY THINK
I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

13:23.230 --> 13:24.822
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, BABE?

13:24.870 --> 13:26.394
THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.034
SEE, AFTER I FIX
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

13:28.070 --> 13:29.935
I'M GONNA WRITE
A MOTIVATIONAL BOOK

13:29.970 --> 13:31.005
FOR LOSERS WHO NEED HELP.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.577
AND THE WORKING TITLE RIGHT NOW
IS MOVE IT...

13:33.610 --> 13:34.872
[yelling]
OR MOVE IT!

13:34.910 --> 13:35.899
[laughing]

13:35.940 --> 13:38.477
WOW, THAT IS SO MUCH STUFF.

13:38.510 --> 13:39.841
WHEN WILL YOU FIND TIME

13:39.880 --> 13:41.142
TO TAPE LARRY LESTER'S
BU'IT CHEEKS TOGETHER?

13:41.180 --> 13:43.080
[laughs]

13:43.120 --> 13:45.315
NEVER SAW BREAKFAST CLUB?
EITHER OF YOU?

13:45.350 --> 13:46.886
WOW.

13:46.920 --> 13:47.887
OKAY, BABY.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.627
HOWIE WANTS ONE OF THOSE
LI'ITLE MINI QUESADILLAS.

13:50.660 --> 13:51.888
LET'S GET Al-TER IT.

13:51.930 --> 13:54.626
WHO HASN'T SEEN
THE BREAKFAST CLUB?

13:54.660 --> 13:55.922
MM.

13:55.960 --> 13:56.858
YOU HONESTLY DON'T THINK

13:56.900 --> 13:58.629
THERE'S ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS
ABOUT THOSE TWO?

13:58.670 --> 13:59.694
I'M NOT SURE.

13:59.730 --> 14:03.166
I MEAN, FOR A GUY
WHO'S CLEARLY STUCK IN THE PAST,

14:03.210 --> 14:05.508
HE SEEMED TO BRUSH OFF
THE WHOLE VANDALISM

14:05.540 --> 14:07.599
OF HIS TROPHY CASE THING
PRETTY EASILY.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.528
I COULD DUST THE CASE
FOR PRINTS,

14:09.580 --> 14:10.706
BUT THAT'S IT.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.945
JULES, ANYONE WHO ENTERS OR
EXITS THIS PLACE IS A SUSPECT.

14:12.980 --> 14:15.073
THIS THING ENDS
BEFORE I SOLVE THE HOMICIDE,

14:15.120 --> 14:16.576
YOU CAN KISS THE MURDERER
GOOD-BYE.

14:16.620 --> 14:17.917
GUS, THANK GOODNESS.

14:17.950 --> 14:18.712
I NEED TO GET TO THE ROOF.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.217
I NEED TO GET
INTO THE LIBRARY.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.409
I NEED TO PSYCHICALLY REMEMBER

14:21.460 --> 14:22.449
EVERYTHING ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL.

14:22.490 --> 14:23.980
THAT STUFF IS LOCKED UP TIGHT.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.521
THIS PLACE IS LIKE FORT KNOX
TONIGHT.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.549
FINE.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.624
WHERE'S THE GYMNASIUM?

14:28.660 --> 14:31.299
WE'RE IN THE GYMNASIUM,
SHAWN.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.907
WOW, BUDDY, YOU DID
A REALLY NICE JOB.

14:38.040 --> 14:41.271
[phone rings]

14:41.310 --> 14:43.005
HEY, SHAWN, WHAT'S UP?

14:43.050 --> 14:44.039
LISTEN, DAD,

14:44.080 --> 14:46.207
REMEMBER THAT BOX
OF MY OLD HIGH SCHOOL STUFF

14:46.250 --> 14:48.013
THAT MOM PUT AWAY
FOR ME?

14:48.050 --> 14:50.245
IT WAS JUST--
IT WAS A BOX OF STUFF.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.279
WHAT BOX?

14:51.320 --> 14:52.287
[Shawn on phone]
THE BOX.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.389
WHAT BOX, SHAWN?

14:53.420 --> 14:55.513
WHAT AM I THINKING?
MOM'S IN TOWN.

14:55.560 --> 14:56.379
DO ME A FAVOR.

14:56.420 --> 14:57.648
CALL HER,
FIND OUT WHERE SHE PUT IT.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.385
I CAN'T.
I CAN'T.

14:59.430 --> 15:00.499
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU CAN'T?

15:00.530 --> 15:01.519
I CAN'T.

15:01.560 --> 15:02.549
I JUST TALKED TO HER, SHAWN,

15:02.600 --> 15:03.919
AND I THINK SHE THOUGHT--

15:03.970 --> 15:05.392
I MEAN, SUPPOSEDLY SHE HAD
A SALAD.

15:05.430 --> 15:06.397
WHO AM I TO THINK

15:06.430 --> 15:07.658
THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE A SALAD?

15:07.700 --> 15:10.237
DAD, I NEED THIS BOX.

15:11.310 --> 15:13.073
JUST CALL HER,
LOCATE THE BOX.

15:13.110 --> 15:14.236
I WILL COME GET IT FROM YOU.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.429
FINE.

15:15.480 --> 15:16.947
FINE.

15:16.980 --> 15:19.039
WHAT IS HE TALK--
I DON'T--

15:21.750 --> 15:23.308
I JUST DON'T SEE IT.

15:23.350 --> 15:25.181
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING.

15:25.220 --> 15:26.289
THERE'S SO MUCH STUFF.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.719
WHAT IS ALL THIS CRAP?

15:27.760 --> 15:28.954
IT'S YOUR LIFE.

15:28.990 --> 15:30.526
THESE BOXES ARE NOT
MY LIFE.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.551
WELL, IT'S STUFF
FROM YOUR LIFE ANYWAY.

15:32.590 --> 15:34.626
I BOXED IT ALL UP
'CAUSE I THOUGHT

15:34.660 --> 15:36.389
MAYBE SOMEDAY YOU'D WANT
TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN...

15:36.430 --> 15:37.692
WHEN YOU'RE OLD
AND CROTCHETY.

15:37.730 --> 15:40.039
YEAH, WELL,
I JUST WANT TO DUMP IT ALL.

15:40.070 --> 15:42.265
WHICH IN YOUR CASE
WOULD BE TODAY.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.268
OOH.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.005
LOOKIT--LOOKIT THIS.
LOOK AT THAT.

15:46.040 --> 15:46.938
WHAT IS IT?

15:46.980 --> 15:48.572
IT'S A MATCHBOX CAR.
IT'S SHAWN'S FIRST ONE.

15:48.610 --> 15:50.339
I BOUGHT IT FOR HIM.
I BROUGHT IT HOME, REMEMBER?

15:50.380 --> 15:51.745
I DO.

15:51.780 --> 15:53.543
HE NEVER EVEN PLAYED
WITH IT.

15:53.580 --> 15:55.969
HENRY, YOU BOUGHT HIM
A SQUAD CAR.

15:56.020 --> 15:57.544
WELL, KIDS LOVE POLICE CARS.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.013
BUT THEY'RE ALL POLICE CARS.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.118
ALL 20 OF THEM.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.058
NO, NO, NO.
THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT.

16:02.090 --> 16:04.388
YOU SEE THAT ONE THERE?
THAT'S A SQUAD CAR.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.580
THIS ONE HERE--SEE THAT?

16:06.630 --> 16:09.758
THAT'S A PADDY WAGON.

16:09.800 --> 16:13.463
A PRISON TRANSPORT VEHICLE.
THAT'S AN OLD ONE.

16:13.500 --> 16:16.537
LOOK AT THAT.
CROWD CONTROL VAN.

16:16.570 --> 16:19.266
LOOK, IT EVEN HAS LI'ITLE TINY
WATER CANNONS UP ON TOP.

16:19.310 --> 16:22.768
HERE'S THE BOX HE WANTED.

16:22.810 --> 16:24.675
WOW.

16:24.710 --> 16:27.019
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD'VE BECOME,

16:27.050 --> 16:29.678
LIKE, A DOCTOR OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

16:29.720 --> 16:33.417
WELL, WHAT I DO
IS PRETTY FASCINATING.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.054
REALLY?
HOW SO?

16:36.090 --> 16:39.548
WELL, WITH MY SPECIALTY,

TRACKED DOWN A COUNTERFEITER,

UNVEILED A NANNY RING,

16:55.180 --> 16:57.045
SAVED THE SHOW AMERICAN DUOS,

16:57.080 --> 16:58.399

16:58.450 --> 16:59.542

16:59.580 --> 17:01.548
I REMEMBER THAT.

17:01.580 --> 17:04.140
I'M KIND OF WORKING

17:22.340 --> 17:23.466

17:23.510 --> 17:24.636
I ASKED YOU TO LOCATE
THE BOX

17:24.670 --> 17:26.137
SO THAT I COULD COME
PICK IT UP FROM YOU.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.331
NOT TO DRAG MOM DOWN
TO MY HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.404
LIGHTEN UP, HONEY.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.748
WHAT ARE YOU SO WORRIED ABOUT?

17:30.780 --> 17:32.577

I'M GONNA PULL OUT A KLEENEX,

17:32.610 --> 17:34.373
WET IT, AND THEN WIPE
THE CORNERS OF YOUR MOUTH.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.172

17:47.900 --> 17:49.219
OKAY, FINE.

17:49.260 --> 17:50.227

AWARD.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.623

BLAZER RENTAL PLACE

17:52.870 --> 17:53.837

18:03.550 --> 18:05.700
I JUST THINK A BETTER NAME

18:05.750 --> 18:08.310
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE YOU HAVE
SUCH A CUTIE PATOOTIE.

18:08.350 --> 18:09.817
OH!

18:12.620 --> 18:14.110
JUST ENOUGH TO REALIZE,
YOU KNOW,

18:14.160 --> 18:17.357
THAT I MIGHT'VE BEEN
A LITTLE SHORT WITH YOU BEFORE

18:17.390 --> 18:19.654
AND I'M VERY SORRY.

18:19.690 --> 18:21.157
CAN YOU FORGIVE ME?

18:21.200 --> 18:23.327
[giggIeSJ
MAYBE.

18:23.370 --> 18:24.792

WEENSY LITTLE TINY FAVOR

18:29.800 --> 18:31.836
TO ASK OF YOU.

18:31.870 --> 18:32.939
WHAT'S THAT?

18:32.970 --> 18:35.803
I NEED YOU TO MAKE A MOVE
ON ELDON'S WIFE, STEPHANIE,

18:35.840 --> 18:39.173
'CAUSE I WANT THAT PAINTED WHORE
OUT OF THE PICTURE, OKAY?

18:39.210 --> 18:40.518
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME?

18:40.550 --> 18:41.710
NO.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.183
NO, I CANNOT DO THAT
FOR YOU.

18:43.220 --> 18:45.780
FINE.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.879
YOU SUCK!

18:47.920 --> 18:49.649

WELL, THAT FIGURES.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.376
WHAT ARE THOSE?

19:10.410 --> 19:12.241
JUST A COPY OF EVERY KEY
IN THE SCHOOL.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.918
BY THE END OF SENIOR YEAR,

19:13.950 --> 19:15.815
I MANAGED TO BECOME
A MEMBER

19:15.850 --> 19:16.919
OF THE TRANS-AMERICAN
WESTERN CUSTODIAL UNION,

19:16.950 --> 19:18.838
LOCAL 456.

19:18.890 --> 19:20.255
DON'T HOLD ME TO THIS,

19:20.290 --> 19:22.918
BUT I BELIEVE I STILL HAVE
VOTING PRIVILEGES.

19:22.960 --> 19:26.384
IT'S BEEN 35 YEARS SINCE
I'VE WANDERED THESE HALLS.

19:26.430 --> 19:28.250
I THINK I'M GONNA TAKE
A LOOK AROUND.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.119
YOU WANNA JOIN ME?

19:29.160 --> 19:31.469
THAT DEPENDS.
DO YOU HAVE A HALL PASS?

19:31.500 --> 19:32.694
YOU KIDDING?

19:32.730 --> 19:35.767
I USED TO OWN THESE HALLS.

19:40.910 --> 19:42.605
DID YOU BRING ME
A GLASS OF PUNCH

19:42.640 --> 19:44.904
AS SOME SORT OF 13-YEAR
PEACE OFFERING?

19:44.950 --> 19:47.316
OH, NO.

19:47.350 --> 19:50.683
SORRY, THESE ARE BOTH
FOR ME ACTUALLY.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.779
I CAN GRAB YOU ONE THOUGH
IF YOU'D LIKE.

19:52.820 --> 19:53.855
NO.

19:53.890 --> 19:54.857
I DO HAVE A QUESTION
FOR YOU THOUGH.

19:54.890 --> 19:55.857
HMM?

19:55.890 --> 19:57.881
ASSUMING THAT PARKER STEVENSON

19:57.930 --> 20:01.229
HAD NEVER BEEN BORN,

20:01.260 --> 20:02.750
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
A VERY ATTRACTIVE MAN

20:02.800 --> 20:04.267
SOLVE A CRIME BEFORE?

20:04.300 --> 20:07.189
I DID SEE JOHN CUSACK PREVENT
A JAYWALKING ONCE.

20:08.770 --> 20:09.964
MM.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.300
[exhales]

20:14.340 --> 20:16.638
THIS IS GOOD.

20:16.680 --> 20:17.977
YEAH.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.546
JUST, UH,
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

20:19.580 --> 20:21.309
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO DO MY THING, OKAY?

20:21.350 --> 20:23.011
YOU MIGHT WANT TO STEADY
OR BRACE YOURSELF.

20:23.050 --> 20:24.586
WHY, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

20:24.620 --> 20:26.838
WELL, I CAN'T REALLY SAY
WITH ANY DEGREE OF ACCURACY.

20:26.890 --> 20:27.914
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT

20:27.960 --> 20:30.428
SOME ANIMALS, SLOW ADULTS,

20:30.460 --> 20:31.950
AND BEAUTIFUL GIRLS
HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO SWOON.

20:31.990 --> 20:34.254
YOU JUST CALLED ME SLOW.
EXCUSE ME.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.262
ARE YOU OKAY?

20:54.820 --> 20:56.469
I'M A SLAVE TO IT.

20:59.490 --> 21:00.616
[laughs]

21:00.660 --> 21:02.685
[breathes heavily]

21:02.720 --> 21:05.325
SHH.

21:05.360 --> 21:08.022
WAIT FOR IT.

21:08.060 --> 21:10.767
WAIT FOR IT.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.722
[stifled laugh]
DON'T DO THAT.

21:12.770 --> 21:13.964
DON'T MOCK THE SPIRIT.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.831
[laughs]
SHH.

21:15.870 --> 21:17.030
IT'S BEN EATH YOU.

21:17.070 --> 21:18.560
SHH.

21:21.740 --> 21:25.949
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED...

21:25.980 --> 21:27.572
WHY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN MARRIED
YET?

21:27.620 --> 21:30.339
I DON'T HAVE TO WONDER.
I KNOW WHY.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.641
WELL, WHY?

21:31.690 --> 21:34.716
I WILL GET MARRIED...
SOMEDAY.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.524
I JUST HAVEN'T MET HIM YET.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.857
YOU DON'T THINK.

21:38.890 --> 21:40.596
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

21:40.630 --> 21:42.996
WHAT ABOUT ME, ABIGAIL?

21:43.030 --> 21:47.569
LOTS OF STRAPPING,
BRILLIANT-TYPE GUYS

21:47.600 --> 21:49.090
NEVER GOT MARRIED.

21:49.140 --> 21:50.095
LU DWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.

21:50.140 --> 21:52.062
SIR ISAAC NEWTON, RIGHT?

21:52.110 --> 21:54.078
DOING HIS THING.

21:54.110 --> 21:57.671
JON LOVITZ.

21:57.710 --> 21:59.746
JON LOVITZ'S BROTHER.

21:59.780 --> 22:01.418
JON LOVITZ HAS A BROTHER?

22:01.450 --> 22:03.782
DOES IT REALLY. . . MA'ITER?

22:16.400 --> 22:17.424
I JUST FIGURED IT OUT.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.119
WHAT?
WHY YOU NEVER GOT MARRIED?

22:19.170 --> 22:25.962
NO--I KNOW WHO
OUR MURDERERS ARE.

22:26.010 --> 22:28.137
(Gus)
SO, WAIT--
NOW YOU ARE SAYING

22:28.180 --> 22:29.135
THAT HOWIE AND EILEEN
ARE THE KILLERS?

22:29.180 --> 22:30.033
(Shawn)
YEP.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.446
WASN'T HOWIE THE VICTIM
AT ONE POINT?

22:32.480 --> 22:33.879
GUS, THAT IS SO 40 MINUTES AGO.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.115
I BET YOU'RE STILL TELLING
YOUR FRIENDS TO "CHILLAX."

22:36.150 --> 22:38.618
SHAWN, WHY WOULD TWO PEOPLE
WHO JUST KILLED SOMEONE

22:38.650 --> 22:41.153
BE SO CASUAL:
SMILING, DANCING.

22:41.190 --> 22:42.452
I AGREE.

22:42.490 --> 22:44.424
IT IS BOTH SURREAL
AND DISTURBING

22:44.460 --> 22:46.121
TO WATCH TWO MURDERERS
DO THE CABBAGE PATCH.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.696
BUT THAT'S THE POINT, GUS.

22:47.730 --> 22:51.359
THEY'RE TRYING TO LOOK
AS CASUAL AS POSSIBLE.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.430
BUT I'M NOT FOOLED.

22:56.470 --> 23:01.430
THE QUESTION IS WHY
ARE THEY STICKING AROUND?

23:01.480 --> 23:03.471
LOOKING FOR INFO
ON OUR BELOVED COUPLE.

23:03.510 --> 23:06.047
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT SAY
"FUTURE KILLERS."

23:06.080 --> 23:07.843
WHAT DOES THAT WORD
EVEN MEAN ANYWAY:

23:07.880 --> 23:09.142
"GREATN ESS."

23:09.180 --> 23:11.148
IT'S LIKE THEY PURPOSELY
SET YOU UP FOR FAILURE.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.543
I MEAN, WHAT HAVE I DONE
IN MY LIFE

23:12.590 --> 23:14.478
THAT ANYONE WOULD SAY
WAS GREAT?

23:14.520 --> 23:15.885
DUDE, THE PERFECT COCOA
ROUNDNESS OF YOUR HEAD ALONE

23:15.920 --> 23:17.524
MAKES YOU GREAT.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.653
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU
TO SAY, SHAWN.

23:19.690 --> 23:22.158
NO ONE HAD ANY EXPECTATIONS
YOU WOULD AMOUNT TO GREATNESS.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.122
GUS, DON'T BE AN INCORRIGIBLE
ESKIMO PIE

23:24.170 --> 23:25.159
WITH A CARAMEL RIBBON.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.589
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THESE PEOPLE THINK OF YOU.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.699
BUT, AND I PUT THIS OUT THERE
AS A CHALLENGE TO YOU,

23:29.740 --> 23:31.105
YOU REALLY WANT TO SHOW 'EM

23:31.140 --> 23:32.869
YOU'VE LIVED UP
TO YOUR POTENTIAL?

23:32.910 --> 23:34.878
HELP ME SOLVE THIS CASE,
PLEASE.

23:34.910 --> 23:36.434
COME ON, HOW MANY
OF OUR CLASSMATES

23:36.480 --> 23:37.845
ARE OUT THERE SOLVING
A MURDER TONIGHT, HUH?

23:37.880 --> 23:38.869
A HAN DFUL MAYBE?

23:38.910 --> 23:40.571
YOU COULD BE ONE OF THEM.

23:49.860 --> 23:51.452
DUCKY.

23:51.490 --> 23:52.627
WHAT?

23:52.660 --> 23:54.218
DUDE!

23:54.260 --> 23:56.091
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
IN THE WRONG JOHN HUGHES MOVIE.

23:56.130 --> 23:58.189
THIS ISN'T BREAKFAST CLUB ,
OR CURLY SUE,

23:58.230 --> 24:00.460
OR MR. MOM AND IT CERTAINLY
ISN'T FLUBBER.

24:00.500 --> 24:01.467
WHY ARE YOU HATIN'
ON FLUBBER?

24:01.500 --> 24:02.592
I WOULD NEVER HATE
ON FLUBBER.

24:02.640 --> 24:03.959
I'M NOT FOLLOWING.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.762
WHAT DO ALL THE BEST
JOHN HUGHES MOVIES

24:05.810 --> 24:07.539
HAVE IN COMMON?
A LOVE TRIANGLE.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.571
THERE'S ALWAYS...

24:09.610 --> 24:10.577
A DUCKY.

24:10.610 --> 24:12.202
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
THAT GUY?

24:12.250 --> 24:13.569
VAGUELY.

24:13.620 --> 24:14.814
I DON'T KNOW
HIS NAME THOUGH.

24:14.850 --> 24:16.477
CHECK THE GRAD PICS.

24:20.620 --> 24:21.757
HE DIDN'T SHOW UP.

24:21.790 --> 24:23.087
17 NO-SHOWS.
HE'S ONE OF THEM.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.156
THE QUESTION IS WHICH ONE.

24:25.190 --> 24:27.124
DUCKY, WHERE ARE YOU?

24:27.160 --> 24:29.128
IS THIS THE SAME GUY?

24:31.630 --> 24:33.530
GOOD WORK, GUS.

24:33.570 --> 24:35.458
THIS IS GOOD.

24:37.770 --> 24:39.260
I THINK I JUST FIGURED
SOMETHING OUT.

24:39.310 --> 24:41.232
I GO'ITA MAKE
A QUICK STOP.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.601
ARE WE BACK IN BUSINESS,
PARTNER?

24:43.650 --> 24:44.742
MILO AND OTIS.

24:44.780 --> 24:45.906
I GET TO BE OTIS?

24:45.950 --> 24:46.905
THAT'S A GIVEN.

24:46.950 --> 24:48.269
OKAY, BUT LOOK,

24:48.320 --> 24:49.139
I HAVE TO GET BACK
TO THE GYM

24:49.180 --> 24:50.078
AND MAKE SURE
ALL THE BALLOTS ARE IN

24:50.120 --> 24:52.588
OR WE WON'T HAVE
A REUNION KING AND QUEEN.

24:52.620 --> 24:53.609
MEET YOU THERE?
YEAH.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.082
OR WE COULD MEET
BACK HERE

24:55.120 --> 24:56.212
AND GIVE EACH OTHER MAKEOVERS

24:56.260 --> 24:57.727
TO KARLA DEVITO'S
WE ARE NOT ALONE.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.079
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

25:16.340 --> 25:19.707
DAD?

25:19.750 --> 25:21.149
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

25:21.180 --> 25:22.613
HOW DID--

25:22.650 --> 25:23.810
HOW DID YOU EVEN
GET IN HERE?

25:23.850 --> 25:24.987
PLACE WAS OPEN.

25:25.020 --> 25:26.908
YOUR MOM AND I WERE JUST
LOOKING AROUND.

25:26.950 --> 25:27.917
SHE'S IN THE BATHROOM.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.656
SO WHAT, YOU JUST...

25:30.690 --> 25:32.328
YOU JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS A NORMAL THING

25:32.360 --> 25:33.793
SO SIT HERE IN THE DARK?

25:33.830 --> 25:35.650
SHAWN, I USED TO FIX UP CARS

25:35.700 --> 25:38.168
IN THIS VERY PLACE
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.599
I ACTUALLY DROPPED THE TRANNY

25:39.630 --> 25:40.892
OUT OF A '57 CHEW
JUST LIKE THIS ONE.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.636
PRACTICALLY REBUILT THE THING
FROM SCRATCH.

25:43.670 --> 25:44.659
WHEN THAT THING WAS DONE,

25:44.710 --> 25:47.679
BABY, I'LL TELL YOU,
IT PURRED.

25:47.710 --> 25:48.972
NOW I FEEL AWFUL.

25:49.010 --> 25:50.136
WHY?

25:50.180 --> 25:51.306
MOM.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.079
SHE'S STILL IN THE BATHROOM.

25:53.110 --> 25:54.270
SHE MISSED THAT ENTIRE STORY.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.673
SHAWN, IT'S NOT MY FAULT
THAT YOU NEVER CARED

25:55.720 --> 25:57.073
ABOUT ANYTHING IN HIGH SCHOOL.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.985
YEAH, WELL, AS IT TURNS OUT,

25:59.020 --> 26:01.181
IT SEEMS I DID CARE
ABOUT SOMETHING.

26:01.220 --> 26:03.859
I GUESS IT DOESN'T MA'ITER
MUCH ANYMORE.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.351
DAD, DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
MISS OUT ON A MOMENT?

26:08.400 --> 26:09.856
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:09.900 --> 26:10.696
LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY.

26:10.730 --> 26:12.664
YOU THINK YOU COULD MISS
AN OPPORTUNITY

26:12.700 --> 26:14.099
IN A MOMENT.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.028
YOU KNOW,
AND THEN IT'S TOO LATE.

26:16.070 --> 26:18.106
AND THE COURSE OF YOUR LIFE
IS CHANGED FOREVER.

26:18.140 --> 26:20.563
YEAH.
ABSOLUTELY.

26:23.110 --> 26:25.647
WAIT A MINUTE.
IS THIS ABOUT A GIRL?

26:25.680 --> 26:26.942
MAYBE.

26:26.980 --> 26:29.949
LIFE IS NOT MADE UP
OF A SINGLE MOMENT.

26:29.980 --> 26:31.914
IT'S MADE UP
OF A GAZILLION MOMENTS.

26:31.950 --> 26:34.180
WHAT DEFINES US
IS THE CHOICE WE MAKE

26:34.220 --> 26:36.313
IN THE NEXT MOMENT,
AND THE ONE Al-TER THAT.

26:36.360 --> 26:37.952
THESE MOMENTS, SHAWN,
THEY'RE HAPPENING.

26:37.990 --> 26:40.993
THEY'RE ALL AROUND US
ALL THE TIME.

26:44.730 --> 26:46.197
YOU'RE HAVING ONE RIGHT NOW.

26:46.230 --> 26:47.629
I JUST KEEP WONDERING,

26:47.670 --> 26:49.365
LIKE, WHAT IF I'D MADE
A DIFFERENT CHOICE,

26:49.400 --> 26:51.231
YOU KNOW,
LIKE, ON A PARTICULAR NIGHT,

26:51.270 --> 26:52.635
IN ONE OF THESE MOMENTS,

26:52.670 --> 26:54.638
WHO WOULD I BE NOW?

26:54.680 --> 26:57.808
WELL, I SUSPECT THAT YOU
WOULDN'T BE YOU.

27:04.350 --> 27:06.079
GOOD TALK, DAD.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.951
I GO'ITA RUN.

27:07.990 --> 27:10.151
ACTUALLY, THERE IS
ONE MORE THING.

27:10.190 --> 27:12.283
DO YOU THINK I COULD BORROW
YOUR UNDERPANTS?

27:12.330 --> 27:17.222
JUST--JUST FOR, LIKE,
TEN MINUTES.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.399
OH, COME ON!

27:19.430 --> 27:20.795
WE'RE ALREADY IN THE CAR!

27:20.840 --> 27:22.728
THESE ARE--THESE ARE ICONIC
FILM REFERENCES

27:22.770 --> 27:24.260
I'M MAKING TONIGHT.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.905
(Shawn)
HIS NAME IS PETER COLTER,
CLASS OF '95.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.669
(Gus)
CAN WE HURRY THIS UP?

27:29.710 --> 27:30.779
I'M DUE BACK IN THE GYM
TO MAKE MY PRESENTATION.

27:30.810 --> 27:32.277
IF CHIEF VICK KNEW I WAS
RUNNING NAMES FOR YOU GUYS,

27:32.310 --> 27:33.709
I'D LOSE MY ASS.

27:33.750 --> 27:34.876
WE DEFINITELY DON'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN.

27:34.920 --> 27:35.875
OH, WAIT--

27:35.920 --> 27:36.272
I HAVE SOMETHING.

27:36.320 --> 27:37.446
WHAT IS IT?

27:37.480 --> 27:38.947
WELL, IT'S NOT CRIMINAL,

27:38.990 --> 27:39.945
BUT IT'S AN ACCIDENT REPORT.

27:39.990 --> 27:40.957
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT

27:40.990 --> 27:42.309
ON JUNE 6TH, 1995.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.419
THAT WAS TH REE DAYS
BEFORE GRADUATION.

27:44.460 --> 27:46.257
(Juliet)
PETER COLTER WAS THE DRIVER.
ALCOHOL WAS INVOLVED.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.099
HE HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE
HEAD-ON.

27:48.130 --> 27:50.223
A MAN WAS THROWN FROM THE CAR
20 FEET.

27:50.260 --> 27:51.261
WE WAS RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL,

27:51.300 --> 27:53.063
SURVIVED IN A COMA
FOR SEVEN MONTHS

27:53.100 --> 27:55.466
AND EVENTUALLY DIED
FROM INTERNAL INJURIES.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.092
PETER COLTER WAS THEN CHARGED

27:57.140 --> 27:58.368
WITH INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER

27:58.410 --> 28:00.207
AND RECEIVED SIX YEARS
PROBATION.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.798
BUT THERE WERE
TWO OTHER PASSENGERS

28:01.840 --> 28:02.807
IN THE CAR WITH HIM.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.376
LET ME GUESS.

28:04.410 --> 28:06.378
HOWIE TOLKIN
AND EILEEN MAZWELL.

28:06.410 --> 28:07.206
YEAH, HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

28:07.250 --> 28:09.275
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN
PRETTY IN PINK,

28:09.320 --> 28:11.379
LIKE, 75 TIMES.

28:11.420 --> 28:13.479
WAIT, WAIT,
AND HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

28:13.520 --> 28:14.487
WELL, IT'S SMALL,

28:14.520 --> 28:15.748
BUT SOME PE'ITY THEI-T

28:15.790 --> 28:17.781
THAT WAS OUT OF STATE.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.923
SHOPLII-TING
IN FALLON, NEVADA,

28:19.960 --> 28:22.793
WHICH LEADS ME
TO A RESTRAINING ORDER.

28:22.830 --> 28:24.889
IT WAS PLACED ONE MONTH AGO

28:24.930 --> 28:26.727
BY EILEEN MAZWELL
AND PETER COLTER.

28:26.770 --> 28:27.930
FOR WHAT?

28:27.970 --> 28:29.494
HARASSMENT.

28:29.540 --> 28:33.431
[humming]

28:33.470 --> 28:34.732
PETER WASN'T DRIVING
THE CAR THAT NIGHT.

28:34.780 --> 28:35.735
IT WAS HOWIE.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.475
WHAT, AND HE TOOK THE RAP
FOR THE ACCIDENT?

28:37.510 --> 28:38.477
WHY?

28:38.510 --> 28:40.205
A MOMENT AND A CHOICE, GUS.

28:40.250 --> 28:41.478
LOOK, HOWIE AND EILEEN
KILLED PETER.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.272
I KNOW IT ALL NOW.

28:43.320 --> 28:44.878
BUT NO BODY, NO CRIME.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.182
SERIOUSLY, JULES?

28:46.220 --> 28:48.051
THAT HAS TO BE ON A POSTER
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

28:48.090 --> 28:49.455
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
WE SAY.

28:49.490 --> 28:50.514
WAIT, SO WE KNOW WHO
THE KILLERS ARE.

28:50.560 --> 28:51.925
WE KNOW WHO THEY KILLED.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.359
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A BODY?
WHERE IS IT?

28:53.390 --> 28:54.493
WELL, IF I WAS JUST
SOME AVERAGE GUY

28:54.530 --> 28:55.656
WITHOUT ANY SUPERPOWERS,
I'D SAY,

28:55.700 --> 28:58.260
[mumbling dumbly]
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY YOU ASKING ME?

28:58.300 --> 28:59.767
BUT AS HEAD PSYCHIC

28:59.800 --> 29:01.233
OF THE SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT,

29:01.270 --> 29:05.161
I'D SAY I DON'T KNOW,

29:05.210 --> 29:06.302
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME?

29:06.340 --> 29:07.500
SHAWN.

29:07.540 --> 29:09.508
IT'S STILL HIDDEN SOMEWHERE
AT THAT SCHOOL!

29:09.540 --> 29:11.508
O'HARA, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE THIS LATE?

29:11.550 --> 29:12.972
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE OFF TONIGHT.

29:13.010 --> 29:14.841
YEAH, UM, YOU KNOW,

29:14.880 --> 29:17.417
I WAS OUT, STOPPED BACK BY.

29:17.450 --> 29:19.418
I, UH, YOU KNOW,
FORGOT MY, UH, CHAPSTICK.

29:19.450 --> 29:21.884
WHICH I NOW HAVE.
YAY.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.512
WHERE WERE YOU AT,
YOUR PROM?

29:23.560 --> 29:24.925
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

29:24.960 --> 29:26.222
BECAUSE YOU'RE WEARING
A PROM DRESS.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.549
AND ARE YOU TWO ON A CASE?

29:30.600 --> 29:32.158
CHIEF.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.497
BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER
ASSIGNING YOU ONE.

29:33.530 --> 29:35.896
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

29:35.940 --> 29:37.532
SHE WAS HELPING ME.
I JUST MADE A BUST.

29:37.570 --> 29:38.832
UH, AND WHO IS THAT?

29:38.870 --> 29:40.531
THAT IS A REAL SCHIZOID.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.504
ELIZABETH REBA DAVIS,

29:42.540 --> 29:44.906
A.K.A. MINDY HOWLAND.

29:44.950 --> 29:45.905
WOMAN'S BEEN FILLING
FALSE PRESCRIPTIONS

29:45.950 --> 29:48.316
UNDER FAKE NAMES
SINCE '96.

29:48.350 --> 29:49.476
(Vick)
OH, OKAY.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.817
I SEE.

29:50.850 --> 29:53.819
WELL, GOOD WORK, PEOPLE.

29:54.590 --> 29:56.182
OH, AND BY THE WAY,

29:56.220 --> 29:58.029
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE REALLY WORKING ON,

29:58.060 --> 30:00.119
YOU'RE NOT BEING PAID
FOR THIS.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.388
OW.

30:05.430 --> 30:07.398
THANK YOU FOR THAT,
LASSITER.

30:07.430 --> 30:08.499
YEAH, SWEET.

30:08.540 --> 30:09.962
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'M GONNA GET BACK TO THIS.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.331
I DON'T WANT TO MISS
THE MUG SHOTS.

30:11.370 --> 30:12.860
I'M HAVING FUN.

30:12.910 --> 30:16.835
IT'S THE BEST DATE I'VE BEEN ON
IN A LONG TIME.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.075
(Shawn)
HE LANDED HERE.

30:19.110 --> 30:20.179
WE KNOW THAT.

30:20.210 --> 30:21.211
THERE'S NO OTHER ENTRANCE

30:21.250 --> 30:22.410
THEY COULD'VE GOTTEN INTO

30:22.450 --> 30:24.111
UNLESS THEY DRAGGED THE BODY
200 YARDS

30:24.150 --> 30:25.139
ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE GYM.

30:25.190 --> 30:29.286
RIGHT.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.878
WAIT A MINUTE.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.222
THAT...
IS THE GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM.

30:38.270 --> 30:41.467
OH, NOW THAT HE REMEMBERS.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.593
HOW WOULD THEY EVEN GET A BODY
DOWN THERE ANYWAY?

30:43.640 --> 30:45.904
THAT'S, LIKE, A 13-FOOT DROP.

30:45.940 --> 30:47.601
AH.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.870
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT, PARTNER.

30:49.910 --> 30:50.877
I'M GONNA EASE YOU DOWN,

30:50.910 --> 30:51.842
AND I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.609
YOU MUST BE OUT
OF YOUR DAMN MIND, SHAWN.

30:53.650 --> 30:54.969
I'M NOT GOING DOWN THERE
FIRST.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.078
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

30:56.120 --> 30:57.576
YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS
TO ME NOW

30:57.620 --> 30:59.485
AI-TER I'VE LAID
ALL THE GROUND WORK?

30:59.520 --> 31:01.010
NOW WILL YOU
JUST GET DOWN THERE?

31:01.060 --> 31:02.948
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
HELP ME BACK UP.

31:02.990 --> 31:04.526
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU'RE IN.

31:04.560 --> 31:05.527
HELP ME UP, SHAWN.

31:05.560 --> 31:06.584
ALL RIGHT.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.353
[grunts]

31:09.400 --> 31:10.549
[thud]

31:10.600 --> 31:13.091
UH.
OKAY.

31:13.130 --> 31:14.893
NOW YOU, SHAWN.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.965
SHAWN?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.901
DUDE, I AM SO SORRY.

31:19.940 --> 31:23.432
I DIDN'T REALIZE
I'VE HAD THE KEYS ALL ALONG.

31:23.480 --> 31:24.572
LET'S JUST GET TO IT.

31:24.610 --> 31:26.077
OKAY, INDEED.

31:26.110 --> 31:27.475
LET'S FIND US A BODY.

31:27.510 --> 31:31.583
BUT FIRST, LET'S BOTH OF US
TAKE A PRIVATE MOMENT

31:31.620 --> 31:33.952
TO PAY HOMAGE TO ALL
OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS

31:33.990 --> 31:35.287
THAT HAVE OCCURRED HERE
OVER THE YEARS.

31:35.320 --> 31:37.288
[door opens]

31:50.570 --> 31:52.561
[whispering]
DUDE, IT'S HOWIE
AND EILEEN.

31:52.610 --> 31:54.271
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVEN'T LEI-T
THE REUNION.

31:54.310 --> 31:56.039
THEY STASHED THE BODY,
BUT NOW THEY'VE GOT TO MOVE IT.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.968
YEAH, BUT WHERE IS IT?

32:02.650 --> 32:03.617
[door slams shut]

32:06.150 --> 32:07.617
(EHeen)
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

32:07.650 --> 32:09.208
(Howie)
I THINK THERE'S SOMEBODY
IN HERE WITH US.

32:09.260 --> 32:12.354
I THINK IT CAME
FROM THE STALLS.

32:18.500 --> 32:28.535
[door slams open]

32:28.540 --> 32:38.541
[door slams open]

32:48.600 --> 32:50.158
NOBODY'S THERE.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.964
CHECK THE LOCKERS.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.571
DO YOU HAVE A STICK
OR A SMALL LEAF?

33:10.620 --> 33:13.282
WHY WOULD I HAVE A STICK?

33:22.730 --> 33:23.992
OKAY.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.135
[raspy scream]

33:29.170 --> 33:31.263
TCH-TCH-TCH-TCH.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.232
WE GO'ITA GET THIS BODY
TO LASSITER

33:35.280 --> 33:36.599
IF I'M GONNA ACCUSE THEM
OF THE CRIME.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.505
WHY DON'T WE BRING LASSITER
DOWN HERE?

33:38.550 --> 33:40.302
YEAH, WE COME BACK AND
THE BODY'S GONE AGAIN, COME ON!

33:40.350 --> 33:41.339
IF TOLKIN FINDS US,

33:41.380 --> 33:42.608
HE'S GONNA STRANGLE US.

33:42.650 --> 33:45.210
HE STRANGLES PEOPLE,
SHAWN.

33:45.250 --> 33:46.478
HEAD OR FEET?

33:56.500 --> 33:59.492
SHAWN.
SHAWN SPENCER.

33:59.530 --> 34:01.532
WERE YOU GIRLS ABLE
TO GET SOME PUNCH?

34:03.470 --> 34:06.439
[rock music]

34:06.470 --> 34:10.531
*

34:10.580 --> 34:11.604
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TOMORROW?

34:11.650 --> 34:14.710
FLYING TO SAN FRANCISCO
FOR WORK.

34:14.750 --> 34:17.514
YOU KNOW I'M JUST HERE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

34:17.550 --> 34:18.642
YEAH, OF COURSE.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.510
I, JUST, I...

34:20.550 --> 34:22.086
ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT WANT TO SEE

34:22.120 --> 34:23.382
MY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

34:23.420 --> 34:24.853
YOU DID?

34:24.890 --> 34:27.279
YEAH, SURE, THIS IS...

34:27.330 --> 34:29.423
THIS IS ONLY HALF
THE PICTURE.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.696
[laughs]

34:36.740 --> 34:38.264
YEAH!
THAT WAS FUN, RIGHT?

34:38.310 --> 34:41.802
SO IT IS NOW TIME
TO ANNOUNCE

34:41.840 --> 34:45.344
THE REUNION PROM
QUEEN AND KING.

34:45.380 --> 34:48.372
HOWIE TOLKIN!

34:48.420 --> 34:50.615
[cheers and applause]

34:50.650 --> 34:52.481
AND HIS REAL LIFE BRIDE,

34:52.520 --> 34:55.387
EILEEN MAZWELL!

34:55.420 --> 34:57.809
[cheers and applause]

34:57.860 --> 34:59.179
HEY, HEY, HEY!
WHERE YOU GOING?

34:59.230 --> 35:00.379
HOWIE, EILEEN,
COME UP HERE!

35:05.430 --> 35:07.398
THIS IS EXCITING.

35:09.870 --> 35:11.167
CONGRATULATIONS.

35:11.210 --> 35:14.304
LOOKS LIKE HISTORY
HAS REPEATED ITSELF.

35:14.340 --> 35:16.831
THOSE CROWNS SURE ARE HEAW.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.404
YES, THEY ARE.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.510
HEAW WITH LIES.

35:21.550 --> 35:23.347
YOU SEE, MY FELLOW ALUMNI,

35:23.380 --> 35:27.419
ONE OF YOUR CLASSMATES
WAS MURDERED HERE TONIGHT.

35:27.450 --> 35:29.714
HIS NAME WAS PETER COLTER.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.352
HE WAS A SMART KID.

35:31.390 --> 35:32.823
HE WAS A A WIZ
AT FIXING CARS.

35:32.860 --> 35:34.555
HE WAS ALSO THE WATER BOY
FOR THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.488
THE REASON YOU PROBABLY
DON'T REMEMBER HIM VERY WELL

35:36.530 --> 35:40.466
IS BECAUSE HE LIVED
IN THEIR SHADOW.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.331
HE WORSHIPPED THEM,
DO ANYTHING FOR THEM,

35:42.370 --> 35:45.339
INCLUDING TAKING A RAP
FOR A TRAGIC CAR ACCIDENT

35:45.370 --> 35:49.579
THAT WAS ACTUALLY CAUSED
BY HOWIE.

35:49.610 --> 35:52.306
AND YOU LET HIM DO IT

35:52.350 --> 35:53.374
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE

35:53.410 --> 35:55.742
YOUR PRECIOUS SCHOLARSHIP.

35:55.780 --> 35:57.338
POOR PETER'S LIFE

35:57.380 --> 35:59.280
WAS STUCK IN THAT MOMENT,
AND HE NEVER RECOVERED.

35:59.320 --> 36:02.187
THAT'S WHY HE DIDN'T SHOW UP
TO TAKE HIS YEARBOOK PHOTO,

36:02.220 --> 36:03.289
AND THAT'S WHY HE MOVED AWAY

36:03.320 --> 36:05.322
AND ENDED UP COMMI'ITING
PE'ITY CRIMES.

36:05.360 --> 36:07.328
MEANWHILE, THE TWO OF YOU
MOVED ON

36:07.360 --> 36:08.327
TO UCLA.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.622
YOU MARRIED YOUR PROM QUEEN.

36:09.660 --> 36:11.423
PROBABLY NEVER GAVE
YOUR OLD FRIEND PETER

36:11.470 --> 36:12.459
ANOTHER THOUGHT.

36:12.500 --> 36:15.697
THAT IS...
UNTIL ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.367
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, EILEEN?

36:17.400 --> 36:18.367
SEEING IT'S NO COINCIDENCE

36:18.410 --> 36:20.264
THAT THE RESTRAINING ORDER
THE YOU FILED

36:20.310 --> 36:23.234
AGAINST PETER JUST HAPPENED
TO COINCIDE

36:23.280 --> 36:25.305
WITH HOWIE HERE
ANNOUNCING HIS CANDIDACY

36:25.350 --> 36:26.476
IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY.

36:26.510 --> 36:27.340
PETER COULDN'T TAKE IT
ANYMORE.

36:27.380 --> 36:29.712
HE NEEDED THE TRUTH
TO COME OUT,

36:29.750 --> 36:30.910
SO HE CONTACTED YOU.

36:30.950 --> 36:32.440
YOU TWO DID EVERYTHING
YOU COULD

36:32.490 --> 36:33.684
TO PREVENT HIM
FROM COMING HERE TONIGHT,

36:33.720 --> 36:35.210
BUT HE CAME ANYWAY.

36:35.260 --> 36:37.410
HE WORE
HIS LETTERMAN'S JACKET

36:37.460 --> 36:40.429
WITH HIS SPECIAL STATE
CHAMPIONSHIP PIN.

36:40.460 --> 36:44.419
STILL STUCK
IN THAT ONE MOMENT.

36:44.470 --> 36:45.562
HE VISITED ALL HIS OLD HAUNTS.

36:45.600 --> 36:49.468
MADE A STOP
AT THE AUTO SHOP.

36:49.500 --> 36:52.264
GOT A LITTLE UPSET
WHEN HE SAW THE TROPHY SHRINE

36:52.310 --> 36:53.231
BUILT TO CELEBRATE YOU.

36:53.270 --> 36:56.000
FINALLY, HE CONFRONTED YOU BOTH
ON THE ROOF,

36:56.040 --> 36:57.439
DRUNK AND UPSET.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.448
YOU COULDN'T LET HIM UNCOVER
THE TRUTH.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.448
IT WAS WAY TOO MUCH
TO LOSE.

37:01.480 --> 37:04.415
SO YOU GAVE HIM
ONE FINAL PUSH.

37:04.450 --> 37:07.715
SILENCED HIM ONCE AND FOR ALL.

37:07.750 --> 37:11.254
THREE ARRESTS IN ONE NIGHT.
NOT BAD.

37:11.290 --> 37:12.587
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU HAVE A BODY.

37:12.630 --> 37:13.654
IT'S THE FURRY SABERCAT
BACKSTAGE.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.829
GREAT!

37:15.860 --> 37:17.350
(man)
STAND UP, PLEASE.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.924
UP.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.564
HOMICIDE HOWIE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

37:23.570 --> 37:26.437
AND NOW I'D JUST LIKE
TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY

37:26.470 --> 37:27.937
TO THANK SOMEONE
WHO'S NOT ONLY RESPONSIBLE

37:27.970 --> 37:31.269
FOR PLANNING ALL OF THIS
TONIGHT,

37:31.310 --> 37:33.471
COMPLETE
WITH A RASTAFARIAN THEME

37:33.510 --> 37:35.717
THAT YOU ALL EMBRACED
SO HEARTILY,

37:35.750 --> 37:37.775
BUT WHO IS ALSO
THE MASTERMIND

37:37.820 --> 37:39.447
BEHIND THE SOLVING
OF TONIGHT'S CRIME.

37:39.490 --> 37:40.741
I KNOW IT'S TRUE,

37:40.790 --> 37:43.350
I'M THE PSYCHIC.

37:43.390 --> 37:45.449
BUT, UH, Ol-TEN TIMES
MY REVELATIONS

37:45.490 --> 37:47.481
ARE NOTHING BUT A CRYPTIC MESS.

37:47.530 --> 37:48.497
TONIGHT, FOR INSTANCE,

37:48.530 --> 37:49.690
ALL I COULD SEE

37:49.730 --> 37:51.049
WERE SCENES
FROM PRE'ITY IN PINK,

37:51.100 --> 37:53.398
A GIANT RHOMBUS
IN A T-SHIRT

37:53.430 --> 37:54.636
THAT READ "SOCCER MOMS
ARE EASY."

37:54.670 --> 37:56.399
NOW I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THESE THINGS MEAN,

37:56.440 --> 37:59.034
BUT GUS IS SOMEHOW
ABLE TO SHAPE THEM

37:59.070 --> 38:01.573
INTO COLD HARD
EVIDENTIAL FACTS.

38:01.610 --> 38:03.475
BUT THAT IS NOT
WHAT MAKES HIM GREAT.

38:03.510 --> 38:05.068
NO, SIR.

38:05.110 --> 38:07.305
BURTON GUSTER HAS BEEN
MY BEST FRIEND

38:07.350 --> 38:08.419
SINCE WE WERE FIVE.

38:08.450 --> 38:10.441
AND MAYBE,

38:10.480 --> 38:12.710
JUST MAYBE,

38:12.750 --> 38:14.615
IF ANY OF YOU CAN LOOK
YOURSELVES IN THE MIRROR

38:14.660 --> 38:15.786
AND KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN

38:15.820 --> 38:18.482
HALF AS GOOD A FRIEND
TO SOMEONE ELSE

38:18.530 --> 38:21.419
AS GUS HAS BEEN TO ME...

38:21.460 --> 38:24.918
WELL, YOU TOO
CAN BE CONSIDERED GREAT.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.530
GIVE IT UP
FOR MY BEST FRIEND,

38:27.570 --> 38:29.094
BURTON GUSTER.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.665
[applause]

38:31.710 --> 38:34.008
WHOO!

38:35.410 --> 38:36.479
OH, HENRY.

38:36.510 --> 38:38.546
WE MUST'VE DONE
SOMETHING RIGHT.

38:38.580 --> 38:41.003
THAT WAS ALL YOU.

38:41.050 --> 38:42.472
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.

38:51.490 --> 38:53.788
I MUST SAY
THAT WAS QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

38:53.830 --> 38:55.718
IF YOU'RE THAT GOOD
OF A DETECTIVE,

38:55.760 --> 38:57.398
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
WHAT SORT OF MIDWIFE YOU MADE.

38:57.430 --> 39:00.524
OKAY, THIS IS
13 YEARS OVERDUE,

39:00.570 --> 39:01.594
BUT HERE GOES.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.891
I KNOW THAT YOU THINK

39:02.940 --> 39:04.965
THAT I DIDN'T SHOW UP
THE NIGHT I WAS SUPPOSED

39:05.010 --> 39:06.363
TO MEET YOU AT THE CARNIVAL,

39:06.410 --> 39:08.878
BUT THE TRUTH IS I DID.

39:08.910 --> 39:11.970
YOU WERE STANDING AT THE END
OF THE PIER.

39:12.010 --> 39:15.969
YOU WERE WEARING A BLUE,
THIN-STRIPED BABY DOLL DRESS.

39:16.020 --> 39:19.512
DOC MARTEN SANDALS,
BLACK.

39:19.550 --> 39:21.916
YOU HAD A ROW OF RED BU'ITERFLY
CLIPS IN YOUR HAIR,

39:21.960 --> 39:24.155
SHORT JEAN JACKET
AND THE RIGHT POCKET WAS RIPPED

39:24.190 --> 39:26.920
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS USED
TO SHOVE YOUR FIST IN THERE

39:26.960 --> 39:27.858
WHEN YOU GOT NERVOUS.

39:27.890 --> 39:30.723
YOU WERE PACING BACK
AND FORTH THAT NIGHT.

39:30.760 --> 39:32.762
YOU WAITED AROUND
ALMOST AN HOUR

39:32.800 --> 39:34.768
BEFORE YOU WALKED AWAY.

39:34.800 --> 39:38.759
UM, THESE ARE OUR TICKETS
TO THE CARNIVAL.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.835
I SAVED THEM.

39:40.870 --> 39:43.430
I WAS SO NERVOUS,
I CHOKED.

39:43.480 --> 39:44.447
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:44.480 --> 39:45.674
THAT HARDLY EVER HAPPENS
TO ME.

39:45.710 --> 39:46.847
BUT THE TRUTH IS, ABIGAIL,

39:46.880 --> 39:50.543
I THINK I LIKED YOU
TOO MUCH.

39:50.580 --> 39:53.617
AND SOMEWHERE IN THE BACK
OF MY HEAD,

39:53.650 --> 39:55.811
I KNEW WHAT THAT NIGHT
WOULD MEAN

39:59.060 --> 40:01.085
IF I HADN'T LET YOU
WALK AWAY.

40:01.130 --> 40:04.691
BUT THIS
IS A DIFFERENT MOMENT,

40:04.730 --> 40:06.766
AND IT'S A CHANCE TO MAKE
A DIFFERENT CHOICE.

40:06.800 --> 40:09.462
AND YOU'RE REALLY AMAZING,

40:09.500 --> 40:11.536
AND I KNOW WE CAN'T GO BACK
IN TIME,

40:11.570 --> 40:13.709
BUT I DO WISH THAT
THERE WAS SOME WAY THAT I--

40:13.740 --> 40:16.709
[slow rock music]

40:16.740 --> 40:23.748
*

40:28.620 --> 40:30.053
SO I'LL JUST KEEP THINKING,

40:30.090 --> 40:32.979
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT COMES TO MIND,

40:33.030 --> 40:34.054
I'LL LET YOU KNOW

40:34.090 --> 40:37.491
THAT WAS...REALLY NICE.

40:37.530 --> 40:39.191
PRETTY MUCH PERFECT.

40:39.230 --> 40:40.663
YEAH.

40:42.070 --> 40:43.799
PRETTY MUCH PERFECT.

40:48.110 --> 40:50.169
SO WHERE DO WE GO
FROM HERE?

40:50.210 --> 40:51.871
I DON'T KNOW.

40:51.910 --> 40:55.073
MAYBE THIS IS WHAT...

40:55.120 --> 40:57.008
CLOSURE FEELS LIKE?

40:57.050 --> 41:01.589
MAYBE.

41:01.620 --> 41:03.918
I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE 20-YEAR REUNION.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.985
YEAH, UH...

41:06.030 --> 41:07.850
THOUGH KNOWING GUS
IT'LL PROBABLY BE OUR 23RD,

41:07.890 --> 41:10.199
BUT, UH, I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

41:10.230 --> 41:12.061
YEAH.
SURE.

41:12.100 --> 41:14.739
OKAY.

41:14.770 --> 41:22.029
