is broken.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.567
Oh, what? No way.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.528
Today's open house
has been canceled.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.864
So I need you all
out of the house while

10:55.947 --> 10:58.784
I get the AC guy here
to do some work.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.328
Also, uh, who is the AC guy?

11:01.411 --> 11:02.788
[Skye] Uh, do you want me
to look one up for you?

11:02.871 --> 11:03.955
Uh, no, no, that's okay.

11:04.039 --> 11:06.666
I'm certain Susannah has
her preferred technician

11:06.750 --> 11:09.378
and four approved backups
right here.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.880
Great. Now we don't have to
lie about the black mold

11:11.963 --> 11:13.382

Let's go to the beach.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.925

Let's just get out of here.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.520
You've already ruined my day.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.106

11:30.649 --> 11:32.526
Yeah, the boardwalk.

- [Taylor] Yeah, me too.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.863
[Conrad] Yeah, fine. Yeah.

11:36.947 --> 11:38.365
Hey, you should
come with us, Skye.

11:38.448 --> 11:42.828
Oh, um, sounds very state fair.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.414
I think I should
just stay with you, right?

11:45.497 --> 11:47.915
No. Wasn't my favorite,
but you might like it.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.543

I want to talk to you
about something.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.065
Yeah, sure, sure. What?

12:12.149 --> 12:15.402
I hope you're not mad
that I invited Skye.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.696
I know things are weird
with their mom.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.948
Oh, no, it was nice of you.

12:20.031 --> 12:22.409
Yeah, I just, I think that,
you know, once they get

12:22.492 --> 12:24.995
to see more of Cousins
and hang out with you guys,

12:25.078 --> 12:28.123
then they'll see why
we love this place so much.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.625
And, I mean, I just know
they'll be on our side.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.713
Like it. I'll follow your lead.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.423

It's actually kind of nice
to hang out with Skye.

You know, it's just me,
my dad and Conrad now,

12:44.931 --> 12:46.808
so it's nice
to feel like our family

12:46.892 --> 12:48.477
is a little bit bigger
than that.

My mom was hoping
it would be a chance to

all the shit from the past.
