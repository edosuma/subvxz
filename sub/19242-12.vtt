01:00.185 --> 01:03.104
Things weren't good between you
and Ma-rin after you got married.

01:03.938 --> 01:06.232
I'm really sorry
to have to say this.

01:06.858 --> 01:09.069
Go back now and break up
with Ma-rin if you can.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.072
For both your sake and hers.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.792
You disappeared
right in front of me.

01:24.751 --> 01:25.585
I'm sorry.

01:26.711 --> 01:28.630
I even held your hand,
but you disappeared.

01:29.672 --> 01:32.383
Can't even consider how shocked
and worried I must've been?

01:34.677 --> 01:36.805
So, what would you like me to do?

01:38.681 --> 01:42.268
What can I do to appease you?

01:45.980 --> 01:47.482
I'll ask you one last time.

01:49.442 --> 01:50.401
Don't go.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.906
Don't disappear from my sight.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.619
It scares me
and makes me so anxious.

02:00.495 --> 02:01.871
It worries me so much.

02:03.998 --> 02:06.084
I don't have the confidence
to live like this.

02:09.129 --> 02:09.963
Okay.

02:10.922 --> 02:11.923
Let's do that then.

02:14.634 --> 02:15.468
What?

02:15.927 --> 02:17.178
Marrying you...

02:19.013 --> 02:20.682
I think that was my mistake.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.395
We...

02:27.814 --> 02:28.982
should re-think things.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.029
What do you mean by that?

02:40.451 --> 02:42.453
I'm wondering if I misunderstood.

02:44.038 --> 02:45.165
What do you mean?

02:45.707 --> 02:46.916
I mean just what I said.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.044
I think we might not be suited
for each other.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.381
And?

02:53.464 --> 02:55.842
Things could get harder for you
because of me.

02:55.925 --> 02:56.801
And what?

02:57.677 --> 03:01.347
You said so yourself.
your life is abnormal now.

03:02.807 --> 03:04.767
Do you know how many times
you've said that?

03:05.560 --> 03:06.853
But, that's just me.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.899
I'm different from others.
I'm not normal.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.778
So, that life of happiness
that you want...

03:17.822 --> 03:19.532
I don't think
I can give that to you.

03:22.577 --> 03:26.831
I'm going to live how I want,
leave if you don't like it.

03:27.582 --> 03:28.833
Is that what you're saying?

03:32.212 --> 03:34.923
Let's try to understand each other
and compromise.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.051
Let's try to make it work.
Why can't you say that?

03:38.134 --> 03:39.928
I don't think trying will work.

03:41.846 --> 03:43.681
Because you don't want to bother trying?

03:46.684 --> 03:47.977
Today

03:48.895 --> 03:50.772
I saw you vanish
right in front of me.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.483
And all I did is worry
and wait for you.

03:54.108 --> 03:56.319
What did I do that was so wrong?

03:57.695 --> 04:01.366
Don't wait or worry!
It's a burden on me.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.381
Where are you going
this late at night?

04:17.507 --> 04:18.341
Song Ma-rin.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.762
Let go. I don't want to be
in the same house as you.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.556
You said we should
think things over.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.893
-Isn't this what you wanted?
-Ma-rin.

04:30.478 --> 04:33.106
I'm a burden to you? Let go!

04:33.773 --> 04:37.360
Okay, then I will leave.
You stay here at home.

04:37.485 --> 04:38.778
I'll go to Ki-doong's place.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.280
Why should I?

04:40.863 --> 04:42.282
This is your house.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.576
There's no yours or mine.
Why are you being so childish?

04:45.910 --> 04:47.870
You're the one who
pushed me to leave.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.250
Wait.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.211
Let's not make things difficult
like this.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.424
You think marrying me
was a mistake?

05:00.216 --> 05:01.509
Am I your mistake?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.430
We never registered our marriage,
so it works out.

05:06.222 --> 05:09.475
You can take back your mistake,
so think about it.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.739
What do you want me to do?

05:25.992 --> 05:28.119
We should never have met
to begin with.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.330
You and I were

05:32.123 --> 05:33.750
never destined to meet.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.502
You forcefully changed the future.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.089
That's why this happened.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.633
How much do you know?

05:43.676 --> 05:44.802
Once you return...

05:46.304 --> 05:48.181
end things with me
as soon as you can.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.560
Put my life back
to its original place.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.773
What do you want me to do?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.637
Oh! Ma-rin.

06:28.638 --> 06:29.764
What are you doing here?

06:31.766 --> 06:32.767
I'm a mistreated wife.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.936
What? A mistreated wife?

06:36.145 --> 06:37.980
Did your mother-in-law
come back to life?

06:39.440 --> 06:41.025
Is that supposed to be funny?

06:41.692 --> 06:42.652
We fought.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.446
I can stay a few days, right?

06:45.530 --> 06:47.198
I'm okay with it.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.118
Should we have soju?

06:50.201 --> 06:51.786
Sure. Should we go out and drink?

06:51.911 --> 06:53.371
Let's go out and talk about it.

06:54.455 --> 06:55.873
No, I'm not in the mood.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.548
He thinks marrying me
was a mistake.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.133
Realtor said that?

07:05.842 --> 07:07.135
He says I'm a burden.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.847
He wants to re-think
our relationship.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.186
I feel like dying.

07:22.608 --> 07:23.901
Oh my. What is this?

07:24.819 --> 07:25.736
Who is that?

07:25.820 --> 07:26.654
Hello.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.490
-My coat.
-Where do you think you're going?

07:30.158 --> 07:32.034
No, don't. Stop hitting him.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.828
-My socks.
-Okay.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.538
-So-ri, this is yours.
-Thank you.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.957
-Bye.
-I'm so sorry.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.667
I'm sorry!

07:41.043 --> 07:42.753
Message me when you get home.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.257
My phone.

07:47.842 --> 07:48.718
Bye now.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.600
What was that?
I thought he was a burglar.

07:56.976 --> 07:57.894
Who is that?

07:59.145 --> 08:00.021
Boyfriend?

08:00.104 --> 08:01.731
No, just a fling.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.734
The doorbell rang,
I thought it was my mom

08:04.817 --> 08:06.110
so I put him in the closet.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.156
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.535
Is marriage a joke?

08:16.078 --> 08:17.747
How could he say that to me?

08:18.664 --> 08:21.918
It's obvious that he is trying
to stand his ground with you.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.504
It's a battle of strength
between newlyweds.

08:25.379 --> 08:28.841
You were going overboard,
so he's taking it seriously too.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.426
No.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.096
He was the one
who was taking it seriously.

08:35.765 --> 08:36.933
You didn't see him.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.353
Looking at him,
you could see him wavering.

08:40.561 --> 08:43.272
Then he must have
said it out of anger.

08:43.731 --> 08:46.651
It's not like he's suddenly crazy.
How could he have meant it?

08:48.402 --> 08:50.863
Right?  It must be out of anger.

08:54.033 --> 08:57.495
Even if he was angry,
there are things he shouldn't say.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.790
I really can't let this go.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.293
That little jerk.

09:06.045 --> 09:09.131
His face looked just like this,
as if he was very wronged.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.511
He acts like he's responsible
for the world's problems.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.347
He has a dour expression
on his face.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.350
You think you're the only one
who's disappointed?

09:21.769 --> 09:22.853
You punk.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.275
Hey, you need to stay strong.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.778
Use this opportunity
to fix his habit.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.781
Now that you've
packed up and left,

09:33.864 --> 09:36.117
it's a war
that you can't back out of.

09:36.784 --> 09:40.955
If you give up first,
you'll lose to him forever.

09:42.665 --> 09:43.708
Am I insane?

09:45.084 --> 09:46.127
I'm Song Ma-rin.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.423
He'll have to come all this way.

09:51.299 --> 09:54.552
Then beg with tears
and a runny nose.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.513
I won't take a step until he does.

09:59.765 --> 10:00.600
Okay.

10:01.809 --> 10:06.355
Show him just how cold of a woman
you can be.

10:08.482 --> 10:09.984
Thank you, friend.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.279
You're a great source
of strength.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.948
Thank you.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.503
You're not going to call even once?

10:32.048 --> 10:33.841
I'll let you suffer, you jerk.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.187
I'll see tomorrow morning.

10:47.688 --> 10:51.609
You'll realize tomorrow morning
what you've done.

10:57.114 --> 10:59.116
So uncomfortable.

11:22.390 --> 11:25.267
"How to Survive in Vietnam"

11:33.401 --> 11:36.779
This is the first time
reading hasn't put me to sleep.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.490
Oh, my blood pressure is rising.

11:45.621 --> 11:46.747
Come out for a second.

11:47.289 --> 11:48.582
I need to talk to you.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.668
Can't you hear me?

11:55.005 --> 11:56.424
What? What do you want?

11:58.092 --> 12:00.720
I can't go to Vietnam.

12:01.303 --> 12:04.932
So, if you insist on going,
divorce me and go alone.

12:05.015 --> 12:07.143
Gun-sook, this is a chance for us

12:07.309 --> 12:12.606
to get enough money to live
without working ever again.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.609
If we endure a few years there,

12:15.693 --> 12:17.695
how much do you think we'll have?

12:18.154 --> 12:20.948
If you only knew,
you wouldn't bring up divorce.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.993
-You couldn't even say it.
-I...

12:24.493 --> 12:25.870
don't care about money.

12:26.036 --> 12:28.706
I don't want to go to a place
where I don't know anyone.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.875
Go to sleep.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.794
Why are you ignoring my words?

12:34.462 --> 12:36.297
You're going too far, seriously.

12:39.508 --> 12:42.136
Can't you feel and see it?
I can feel it and see it.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.014
This place is empty
and looks so common.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.099
It will turn into gold.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.143
I'm sure of it.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.563
Almost all of my investors
are optimistic about this.

12:52.646 --> 12:56.275
If you make your move,
we can get started right away.

12:57.401 --> 13:00.404
I thought about it.
Leave your company now.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.240
-Then I will just...
-No.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.159
I told you about that last time.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.121
I thought about it
and I can't invest in something

13:09.205 --> 13:10.706
that's not upfront.

13:25.888 --> 13:26.806
Nothing came.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.185
No call or text.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.314
Stop being so impatient.
It's still morning.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.317
That's true.

13:39.568 --> 13:42.404
It would be a bit much to call
in the morning to say sorry.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.574
Just eat.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.660
By the looks of you,

13:47.868 --> 13:50.996
you'll be surrendering
by the end of today.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.332
I don't want to eat.

13:56.877 --> 13:57.711
Why?

13:59.839 --> 14:01.215
I think I'm injured.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.801
You kicked me last night.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.305
Hello.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.225
What brings you by,
Photographer Song?

14:12.142 --> 14:14.728
Could I use a spare desk?

14:15.020 --> 14:15.980
Yes. Go ahead.

14:16.355 --> 14:19.149
Are you having trouble
working at home?

14:20.067 --> 14:21.735
I don't have a house anymore.

14:21.861 --> 14:22.987
What?

14:25.406 --> 14:28.284
I have a lot to fix up.

14:29.076 --> 14:31.161
I'll be coming into the office
for a  while.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.498
Sure, but you don't look too good.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.458
My heart doesn't feel good.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.731
He still hasn't called?

15:00.316 --> 15:02.526
You're going to hold back
with all your strength?

15:04.987 --> 15:06.697
We'll see who will beat who.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.576
Yesterday, I fought
with my husband and left home.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.203
I'm sure he didn't mean it.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.040
He said he wanted
to re-think our relationship.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.500
I slept at my friend's house.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.836
He still hasn't contacted me at all.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.839
Moms, what should I do?

15:24.632 --> 15:26.300
Should I continue holding out?

15:27.134 --> 15:28.886
I'm getting more and more scared.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.973
For reference,
we are a sweet newlywed couple.

15:47.237 --> 15:50.157
If it's that bad as a newlywed,
your married life seems over.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.744
Sounds like you need
to prepare divorce papers.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.121
He has no feelings for you.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.749
You are the one who loses
if you leave.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.125
You should have stayed.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.711
Your life is like Bap-soon's life.

16:02.878 --> 16:03.712
What?

16:06.215 --> 16:09.134
"Counseling services on divorce agreement,
division of property"

16:15.432 --> 16:17.893
She came to the office
to use the internet?

16:18.727 --> 16:20.646
-What?
-Can we talk?

16:21.772 --> 16:23.232
Honorary Chairman of the Board?

16:23.941 --> 16:26.819
Realtor? I mean, So-joon is?

16:27.444 --> 16:28.988
Oh, you didn't know.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.825
I bet So-joon might have forgotten
that he is, too.

16:33.534 --> 16:37.621
Since he first set this place up,
he stepped away from all of it.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.750
Our board has never seen So-joon
in real life.

16:42.584 --> 16:43.502
Oh.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.547
But we need to pick
a new chairman of the board

16:46.839 --> 16:48.841
to replace my dad.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.010
We need So-joon's final approval.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.971
You can't do it
without So-joon's approval?

16:54.388 --> 16:58.934
Yes, we can't hold the vote
without So-joon's attendance.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.770
So, you want me to persuade him.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.189
Yes, please talk to him.

17:05.274 --> 17:06.108
Of course, I will.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.153
If it's something like this,
of course I should.

17:10.529 --> 17:14.491
Seriously, I didn't want
to call him first.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.202
Just know that you're lucky, Yu So-joon.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.791
What can I do?
I have to call for work.

17:34.553 --> 17:38.182
Oh, don't worry about me
and please pick up.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.641
No, it's okay.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.102
Lawyer Song.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.230
I want to organize my assets.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.650
I want half to go to Song Ma-rin.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.486
-Please take care of that.
-Pardon?

17:51.361 --> 17:52.196
Half?

17:53.280 --> 17:54.698
Hey.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.493
You'll regret it later.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.745
I'd like it done
as soon as possible.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.830
By the end of this month.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.084
You mean it?

18:08.796 --> 18:09.630
A blind date?

18:10.005 --> 18:11.924
No, I don't want to.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.133
It's Tae-sung.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.762
No, of course, I don't have a girlfriend.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.014
Yeah, but I'm not
into blind dates.

18:20.015 --> 18:20.891
What?

18:22.017 --> 18:22.893
Is she that pretty?

18:25.145 --> 18:25.979
How old?

18:27.022 --> 18:30.192
Oh! Then I have to think about it.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.278
Hey, just set a date.
Ki-doong's already fallen for her.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.822
What are you doing? Hey!

18:35.823 --> 18:36.657
Good, right?

18:40.494 --> 18:43.455
-I can't go on a date now.
-I know you're thankful.

18:44.873 --> 18:47.167
You're making me feel conflicted.

18:47.251 --> 18:50.170
If you're going to be like this,
go see my love life.

18:50.254 --> 18:53.799
-I don't want to see your future.
-There's a girl I'm curious about.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.638
It might not be a stranger.

19:02.808 --> 19:03.642
If I look and

19:04.393 --> 19:05.936
it's not very good...

19:06.979 --> 19:08.522
would you stop seeing her?

19:10.649 --> 19:12.609
I don't know.
What should one do?

19:12.860 --> 19:13.861
What if

19:14.987 --> 19:17.239
the woman you like suffers
because of you?

19:18.949 --> 19:22.411
Would you still
date her knowing that?

19:23.453 --> 19:24.788
Why are you acting like this?

19:27.374 --> 19:31.295
Do you know something?
About my love life?

19:32.171 --> 19:33.005
No.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.759
Don't be curious if you don't have
those answers yet.

19:46.393 --> 19:49.605
You have to be in attendance
to vote for the Happiness chairman.

19:50.063 --> 19:53.192
It's too long to discuss over text.
Call when you have time.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.616
Okay. I'll call Se-young.

20:00.866 --> 20:01.700
What?

20:02.743 --> 20:03.577
This is it?

20:07.331 --> 20:08.165
Yes.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.172
What? Do you have something to say?

20:15.380 --> 20:18.842
I heard you invested
in Jangho too, Director.

20:18.926 --> 20:22.846
I heard about that, so I was curious.
How did that happen?

20:24.014 --> 20:28.727
I just got together
with acquaintances and some family.

20:28.852 --> 20:30.312
We barely managed to get enough.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.440
Where did you hear that?
Who told you?

20:33.523 --> 20:35.525
That's how you did it.

20:35.859 --> 20:39.279
Madam Kim has been saying
she didn't know how talented you were.

20:39.363 --> 20:42.491
What the hell! What's with her?

20:42.574 --> 20:44.451
She's a weird woman.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.579
She didn't even invest that much.
What's with her?

20:48.330 --> 20:49.748
Why is she getting in the way?

20:52.626 --> 20:54.628
Oh... I'm sorry.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.678
Does he have no feelings for me?

21:04.429 --> 21:07.891
Hey. It's only been a day
since you left home.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.061
If I think about it,

21:11.770 --> 21:13.230
I don't think I was right.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.692
I think I did interfere too much.

21:19.444 --> 21:20.362
Suppose

21:21.363 --> 21:23.073
Spiderman had a girlfriend.

21:23.532 --> 21:24.741
She says to him that

21:25.450 --> 21:28.120
she wants to break up
if he's going to keep shooting webs.

21:28.787 --> 21:29.871
So, she tells him that.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.000
What would happen to them?

21:34.042 --> 21:35.085
They would break up.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.879
What's so important about a girl? Hey.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.716
He's Spiderman, after all.

21:42.592 --> 21:43.468
Right?

21:46.263 --> 21:48.181
I was thinking too much
about my interest.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.600
I didn't let him ride the subway.

21:51.601 --> 21:52.436
Subway?

21:56.356 --> 21:59.192
What am I going to do
if he doesn't call me?

21:59.735 --> 22:03.196
If you're going to be this way,
just go back home to him.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.824
You can't take it.
Why did you come out?

22:05.907 --> 22:08.035
Why are you yelling at me
while I'm eating?

22:08.869 --> 22:11.038
It's hard enough to eat.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.915
This rice is really yucky.

22:14.249 --> 22:17.794
How could you make it so salty?
That's why you were mistreated.

22:17.878 --> 22:18.754
Mistreatment?

22:19.713 --> 22:21.340
You should not mistreat me.

22:21.965 --> 22:23.925
Realtor ate my food just fine.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.803
He ate it without complaining.

22:30.682 --> 22:31.725
Eat this.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.394
Is he home or not?

23:25.737 --> 23:26.571
Hey!

23:27.239 --> 23:28.407
What are you doing?

23:29.366 --> 23:31.159
How can you eat that up?

23:31.993 --> 23:33.245
You better come back here.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.539
You little rascal.

23:36.039 --> 23:38.166
You can't even tell
what you should eat or not.

23:38.583 --> 23:39.543
Spit it out.

23:43.505 --> 23:44.423
You stay put.

23:52.514 --> 23:53.348
Hello.

23:55.225 --> 23:56.268
I'm just at home.

23:58.353 --> 23:59.187
Now?

24:02.274 --> 24:03.358
Where should we meet?

24:35.432 --> 24:36.266
You're home?

24:36.850 --> 24:37.684
No.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.395
I'm here for a package.

24:41.021 --> 24:43.940
Oh, we didn't get a package yet.

24:45.567 --> 24:46.651
Oh, really?

24:49.112 --> 24:51.990
It's an international package
and I've been waiting a long time.

24:52.991 --> 24:55.994
I got a text
that it's arriving today, so I'll wait.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.539
Okay. Wait for it.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.166
I was on my way out.

25:02.876 --> 25:03.919
You're just leaving?

25:05.795 --> 25:07.214
You don't have anything to say?

25:08.256 --> 25:10.050
I have somewhere to be.

25:10.467 --> 25:11.343
See you next time.

25:19.142 --> 25:20.894
He took off his wedding ring.

25:45.126 --> 25:46.169
I'm on my way now.

25:46.670 --> 25:47.504
However...

25:48.547 --> 25:50.632
How do you know
Director Kim Yong-jin, anyway?

25:53.260 --> 25:55.095
Hand him over to the police.

25:56.763 --> 25:58.473
He will stab you in the back.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.184
No, he has already betrayed you.

26:02.185 --> 26:03.436
What are you talking about?

26:05.313 --> 26:07.857
I thought it would get complicated
if I got involved.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.151
I didn't want to use this.

26:11.152 --> 26:13.071
I can't let him
get away with it.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.491
This place is empty
and looks so common.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.660
It will turn into gold.

26:18.743 --> 26:22.330
If you make your move,
we can get started right away.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.250
What is he talking about?

26:25.792 --> 26:27.961
He went behind your back,
gathered investors,

26:28.044 --> 26:29.546
and bought Jangho.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.800
I thought it was just a rumor.

26:34.884 --> 26:36.469
Why do you have this, Mister?

26:39.014 --> 26:40.307
So-joon!

26:40.390 --> 26:41.558
So-joon!

26:41.808 --> 26:43.018
Listen to me first.

26:43.101 --> 26:45.895
You were the one who set
the trap for Director Kim first.

26:46.896 --> 26:49.899
He was going to take your company's money
and mishandle it anyway.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.152
No, he's going to do something
even worse.<i> </i>

26:52.652 --> 26:55.238
-So, all I did was--
-Something worse like what?

26:56.740 --> 27:00.368
He's going to destroy your company.
He's a really bad person.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.537
Then you should have told me.

27:03.538 --> 27:06.583
At first, I only wanted
to get him away from you.

27:06.666 --> 27:10.170
I tried to get him his own company,
so I even invested.

27:10.503 --> 27:13.673
But, he betrayed me in the end.
I gave him an opportunity.

27:13.798 --> 27:16.092
What am I supposed to do?
He's following his fate.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.179
What would you have done if I told you?

27:19.471 --> 27:21.640
Nothing had even happened yet.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.850
What could you do?
He hadn't done anything.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.560
Can you jail or fire him?

27:25.644 --> 27:28.855
At least you could tell me
so I could be on guard.

27:28.938 --> 27:31.858
Hey, imagine if you start
being on guard with Kim Yong-jin.

27:32.025 --> 27:34.778
Then he'll get angry and upset
and do more wrong.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.073
Did you do the right thing
by setting up Director Kim?

27:38.823 --> 27:39.658
What?

27:40.116 --> 27:43.662
Stop it with the nonsense
about his fate being set.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.121
What's the reality now?

27:46.164 --> 27:49.918
The reality is this now
because of the trap you set.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.671
Are you saying our reality is this
because of me?

27:53.088 --> 27:55.173
Even if you hadn't done what you had,

27:55.423 --> 27:58.176
how can you guarantee
Director Kim would have done this?

27:59.010 --> 28:02.013
Is there a law saying people
have to live out a pre-destined fate?

28:03.431 --> 28:06.267
Stop saying stupid things.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.062
Just come. Come on.

28:09.479 --> 28:12.482
All our conversations
are recorded on this.

28:13.149 --> 28:14.651
This is important evidence.

28:14.859 --> 28:17.737
Put him in jail
before he does anything worse.

28:17.862 --> 28:20.073
Look for embezzlement
or other things.

28:20.156 --> 28:22.283
The 9 million dollars
I didn't give him was

28:22.659 --> 28:25.370
taken from your company.

28:25.787 --> 28:28.248
I'm sure you can look into it
much faster than I can.

28:28.331 --> 28:30.333
I'll take care of it from now on.

28:31.167 --> 28:32.252
Stay out of it, Mister.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.921
How are you going
to take care of it?

28:36.965 --> 28:38.717
You need to put him away.

28:44.472 --> 28:45.306
Chairman.

28:47.434 --> 28:48.393
Come see me.

28:49.102 --> 28:51.521
I have to head out for a meeting.

28:51.604 --> 28:52.647
Follow me.

29:02.615 --> 29:05.827
Chairman, like I told you,
I have a meeting.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.579
-I need to head out.
-Wait.

29:07.662 --> 29:08.997
-I need to make a call.
-No.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.999
Please say what you need to say.

29:11.082 --> 29:11.916
Wait.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.211
Chairman, I'm late.

29:15.336 --> 29:16.296
Yes, Ki-doong.

29:16.921 --> 29:18.631
Call the internal audit team.

29:18.798 --> 29:22.761
Tell themto seize and investigate
everything in Director Kim's office.

29:25.555 --> 29:28.183
We got a tip
about a breach of trust.

29:32.061 --> 29:33.480
What did you just say?

29:34.647 --> 29:35.690
Breach of trust?

29:36.775 --> 29:39.944
I don't really know
what you're talking about, Chairman.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.405
I told you
Jangho city wouldn't work out.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.325
Were you that certain
about that land?

29:48.203 --> 29:49.245
I'll keep it short.

29:50.121 --> 29:54.584
Regarding the issue of Jangho,
the company won't pursue you legally.

29:55.126 --> 29:55.960
However,

29:57.170 --> 29:59.464
I want you
to leave the company immediately.

30:03.843 --> 30:04.677
Yes.

30:07.722 --> 30:08.556
I will.

30:11.935 --> 30:14.354
I understand what you're saying.
I'll do that.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.481
This is the only free pass you get.

30:17.357 --> 30:20.568
If we find proof
of other illegal activity or embezzlement

30:21.736 --> 30:24.322
you should prepare
to be held legally responsible.

30:25.865 --> 30:28.451
Or you can turn yourself in beforehand.

30:28.618 --> 30:30.411
What more could there be?

30:31.663 --> 30:32.997
We'll know soon.

30:34.249 --> 30:37.377
Regardless, you've worked hard
since the early stages of the company.

30:38.586 --> 30:41.506
I hope we don't see
each other again.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.094
Chairman.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.471
Why are you covering up

30:49.931 --> 30:51.224
the Jangho incident?

30:52.934 --> 30:54.686
We don't have a close relationship.

30:54.769 --> 30:56.354
I want to give you an opportunity.

30:57.647 --> 31:00.817
Don't throw this opportunity away
so easily.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.653
It could be your last one.

31:20.169 --> 31:22.297
I can't even kill that guy.

31:23.214 --> 31:25.216
"Director Kim Yong-jin"

31:39.647 --> 31:42.317
Things are really bad now.
They really are.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.277
This is trouble. Big trouble.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.029
What is it?

31:46.112 --> 31:47.280
-Talk.
-What?

31:47.363 --> 31:48.656
-Why did you do it?
-What?

31:48.740 --> 31:49.908
What are you hiding?

31:50.116 --> 31:52.493
I do not know anything.

31:52.577 --> 31:53.578
You do know.

31:53.661 --> 31:55.580
-Your clothes are nice.
-What?

31:55.663 --> 31:57.081
Oh my gosh. You scared me.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.834
-It's Jangho, right?
-Director, you totally scared me.

32:00.126 --> 32:01.044
I'm right, aren't I?

32:01.419 --> 32:02.378
It's Jangho.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.631
-I don't know anything.
-It's Jangho.

32:04.714 --> 32:07.592
-I don't know anything at all.
-Talk now. Talk.

32:07.675 --> 32:09.385
-I'm going to go now.
-Talk now. Talk.

32:10.553 --> 32:12.305
Look all you want.

32:13.181 --> 32:14.349
See if you find anything.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.690
I guess I can't wait
until it goes up.

32:23.650 --> 32:26.235
I should just organize my things
and get out of here.

32:47.215 --> 32:48.049
Who is it?

32:48.549 --> 32:49.550
You have a delivery.

33:35.722 --> 33:37.223
You're leaving again?

33:38.099 --> 33:40.059
-Yeah.
-Just stay home.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.145
I'll go to Ki-doong's place.

33:45.773 --> 33:47.150
You want to go this time?

33:53.781 --> 33:55.241
Why did you take your ring off?

33:58.703 --> 34:00.747
-It's nothing really.
-At this time,

34:01.247 --> 34:04.042
It's nothing
that you took your ring off?

34:04.125 --> 34:05.668
Don't jump to conclusions.

34:06.502 --> 34:08.046
You didn't finish hearing me out.

34:08.755 --> 34:10.757
How could you not call me,
even once?

34:12.383 --> 34:13.885
Why are you doing this to me?

34:15.094 --> 34:16.971
Do you think I came here
for my package?

34:17.055 --> 34:19.098
If you're angry,
you should go all the way.

34:20.308 --> 34:23.144
You get angry by yourself
and wait by yourself.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.229
You get hurt by yourself.

34:26.689 --> 34:28.775
How can you not give me
any space to think?

34:28.858 --> 34:30.234
What are you thinking?

34:31.652 --> 34:34.739
-What are you thinking?
-It's only been two days.

34:35.323 --> 34:39.994
-How can you not even wait two days?
-Two days felt like 20 years to me.

34:42.497 --> 34:44.499
Why are you so clear about everything?

34:45.792 --> 34:46.959
Why do you seem fine?

34:48.252 --> 34:50.505
Two days feel like 20 years to me.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.882
Why are two days
just two days to you?

34:52.965 --> 34:54.842
This is why I feel burdened by you.

34:55.301 --> 34:56.511
Do you live because of me?

34:56.761 --> 35:00.098
You should be cool, strong,
and confident even on your own.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.975
Can't you be that way,
so I don't have to worry so much?

35:04.769 --> 35:07.230
How did you live alone
before we got married?

35:11.609 --> 35:12.485
I don't remember.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.616
Before I met you...

35:19.992 --> 35:21.327
I don't remember anything.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.207
Do I seem pathetic to you?

35:31.087 --> 35:32.797
I don't want to seem that way to you.

35:34.173 --> 35:37.218
I have a lot to say,
but I can't look at you.

35:40.513 --> 35:41.597
Let's talk next time.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.600
I have lots to argue.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.062
I'm going to leave for now.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.262
I wanted to give him an opportunity.

36:23.681 --> 36:27.185
Whatever his fate was,
or his future is supposed to be...

36:28.769 --> 36:31.189
I want to give an opportunity
to change that.

36:32.315 --> 36:35.109
So, you're going to let
Kim Yong-jin off the hook?

36:36.277 --> 36:38.654
I want that same opportunity.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.991
Hey, you can't with Kim Yong-jin.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.620
He committed a crime,
he should get punished.

36:45.703 --> 36:46.787
That's enough.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.457
You have some responsibility too.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.418
I'm sure you were thinking of me though.

36:53.836 --> 36:58.132
I'm already confused
over what to do with me and Ma-rin.

36:59.383 --> 37:00.760
What am I going to do?

37:01.677 --> 37:02.553
Maybe...

37:03.971 --> 37:05.431
She could be left alone soon.

37:11.729 --> 37:14.440
I'm scared
about what might happen to me.

37:17.109 --> 37:19.111
I want to live a long and happy life.

37:20.988 --> 37:22.573
I'll just try to do that.

37:23.741 --> 37:26.494
I'll take responsibility for that.
Even then...

37:30.957 --> 37:32.416
I can't use Ma-rin's life...

37:34.085 --> 37:35.878
and act like I have power
that I don't.

37:38.589 --> 37:39.882
Maybe she'd be better off...

37:41.634 --> 37:43.135
living the life she has left.

37:45.888 --> 37:47.098
Being well on her own.

37:48.808 --> 37:51.102
I should get her
to stop having feelings for me.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.112
Mister.

38:03.906 --> 38:06.409
What is the best thing
I can do now?

38:51.871 --> 38:52.705
Who is it?

38:54.623 --> 38:55.458
Who is it?

38:55.791 --> 38:58.002
Is that you, Bap-soon?

38:58.753 --> 38:59.587
Gun-sook?

39:01.964 --> 39:02.882
Oh my.

39:04.050 --> 39:07.553
-Why are you dressed like that?
-Why are you here?

39:08.679 --> 39:11.557
Well, there's a taxi outside.

39:11.932 --> 39:14.769
Can you go pay for me?
I don't have my wallet.

39:18.272 --> 39:19.440
I don't have money.

39:20.816 --> 39:22.193
Hey, I don't have money.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.612
Just tell us.

39:25.237 --> 39:26.322
I'm dying of curiosity.

39:28.908 --> 39:32.244
Hey, you tell me first.
Why are you sleeping here?

39:35.664 --> 39:37.917
-I got in a fight and left home.
-Really?

39:39.001 --> 39:39.835
Me too.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.464
I told you
because you told me first.

39:44.632 --> 39:48.052
My house isn't a shelter
for mistreated wives.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.512
Mistreated wife?

39:49.845 --> 39:50.930
It's true!

39:52.556 --> 39:55.893
Even if you got in a fight,
why did you leave in your pajamas?

39:56.811 --> 39:58.437
I had my reasons.

40:07.571 --> 40:09.323
Gosh, seriously...

40:10.783 --> 40:12.868
I think I married the wrong guy.

40:14.703 --> 40:16.372
I'm going crazy.

40:18.165 --> 40:21.293
He has been acting
so weird lately.

40:21.752 --> 40:23.421
I felt like I couldn't deal with it.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.215
There's something going on.
There is.

40:26.298 --> 40:28.717
There's another woman
or he's up to something.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.805
Otherwise, he wouldn't be acting
like such a psycho.

40:37.309 --> 40:41.730
I'm going to find out why you're acting
like such a crazy person.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.024
I will find out.

40:48.195 --> 40:49.572
Why is it so clean?

41:09.967 --> 41:12.470
Hey. What are you doing?

41:14.263 --> 41:16.390
-Huh?
-What are you doing at this hour?

41:17.099 --> 41:18.976
No, it's just...

41:19.935 --> 41:21.604
I couldn't sleep.

41:21.896 --> 41:25.524
I thought I would clean the car
and get some air.

41:26.192 --> 41:28.402
-Did you go through my stuff?
-What?

41:28.861 --> 41:31.655
No, I didn't go through anything.
I was cleaning.

41:32.364 --> 41:33.240
But, it's clean.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.451
What's that in your hand?

41:36.285 --> 41:39.330
What? This is just a pen. It's a pen.

41:39.413 --> 41:40.456
What is that?

41:40.539 --> 41:42.708
Happiness, House of Love.
30th House Event.

41:43.542 --> 41:44.376
A pen.

41:46.587 --> 41:47.713
Gosh!

41:49.006 --> 41:50.758
Why would you
dig through my car?

41:51.008 --> 41:52.426
What's with you?
Give me.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.262
Get away.
I'm sorry. Get away from me.

42:02.603 --> 42:03.729
Hey, Lee Gun-sook!

42:04.271 --> 42:06.649
Hey!

42:07.107 --> 42:08.651
So-ri's house.

42:09.318 --> 42:10.819
What? So-ri's house?

42:11.403 --> 42:12.988
Oksu-dong, please.

42:13.155 --> 42:13.989
Hey!

42:14.490 --> 42:16.033
-Then....
-Hey!

42:16.450 --> 42:17.910
I felt chills up my spine.

42:18.911 --> 42:20.162
I was so scared.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.374
I just started to run away.

42:29.296 --> 42:30.756
It was this, here.

42:32.716 --> 42:34.760
Oh, this is one of ours.

42:36.679 --> 42:38.556
It's from the place
I've been working at.

42:38.639 --> 42:41.684
Really? That place
that builds houses for free?

42:41.767 --> 42:43.686
Yeah, I have one too.

42:46.021 --> 42:47.356
But, this...

42:48.524 --> 42:52.278
it was from a move-in event
and not many people have it.

42:52.736 --> 42:54.655
Is he cheating with a girl
who works there?

42:56.532 --> 42:57.366
No.

42:58.242 --> 43:01.787
No, it didn't feel like
it was about cheating at all.

43:02.705 --> 43:04.707
It felt dark and creepy.

43:05.624 --> 43:07.960
He really seemed psychotic.

43:10.170 --> 43:11.088
By any chance...

43:12.756 --> 43:13.591
What?

43:14.842 --> 43:17.678
-Does he have friends in research?
-No.

43:17.761 --> 43:19.763
Does he bring home
many new products?

43:20.764 --> 43:21.932
Does he take the subway?

43:24.351 --> 43:25.477
What do you mean?

43:27.730 --> 43:28.564
Nevermind.

43:32.610 --> 43:36.447
Anyway, someone probably dropped this
in the car.

43:36.947 --> 43:39.700
-It's only a pen.
-That's what I'm saying.

43:40.492 --> 43:42.161
What's so important about this?

43:42.870 --> 43:45.289
Why would he overreact and scream?

43:46.290 --> 43:48.250
I thought
he was going to eat me alive.

43:56.508 --> 43:58.802
Then will they choose
a new chairman

43:58.886 --> 43:59.970
during today's meeting?

44:00.429 --> 44:01.388
They probably will.

44:02.014 --> 44:03.515
I'm curious who they will choose.

44:04.141 --> 44:05.934
I'm more curious
about that person.

44:06.185 --> 44:07.019
Who?

44:07.645 --> 44:09.813
The Honorary Chairman of the Board
is coming.

44:09.897 --> 44:11.899
I've been so curious
about who he is.

44:12.024 --> 44:13.400
-We'll see him.
-He's coming?

44:14.401 --> 44:17.279
You should use honorifics.
He's probably much older.

44:17.863 --> 44:18.739
Is he coming?

44:19.740 --> 44:22.493
Unless he wants to shut Happiness down,
I'm sure he'll come.

44:27.498 --> 44:29.333
Who gave you the tip
about Kim Yong-jin?

44:30.084 --> 44:31.335
Let's talk about it later?

44:32.461 --> 44:35.589
Okay. I'm sure the internal audit team
will do a good job.

44:36.548 --> 44:38.550
"Happiness for Humanity"

44:42.012 --> 44:42.846
What is it?

44:43.389 --> 44:44.848
Are you nervous now?

44:45.557 --> 44:46.767
Nervous? No.

44:46.975 --> 44:49.311
-You are nervous.
-I'm not.

44:55.984 --> 44:56.902
Yeah, Se-young.

44:59.238 --> 45:00.280
We're out front.

45:01.615 --> 45:02.449
You came.

45:02.908 --> 45:04.868
I was worried you wouldn't come.

45:05.494 --> 45:07.413
Everyone will be surprised
to see it's you.

45:07.788 --> 45:09.081
We'll get a good show today.

45:10.249 --> 45:11.083
Let's go in.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.092
You were here?

45:21.468 --> 45:22.553
I came to work.

45:24.805 --> 45:27.391
Why are you two so awkward?
Did you fight?

45:27.641 --> 45:28.475
-No.
-Yes.

45:29.810 --> 45:30.644
We did fight.

45:30.894 --> 45:32.438
We are ready!

45:32.563 --> 45:34.022
-Oh, hello.
-Hello.

45:34.106 --> 45:36.108
-Hello.
-Hello.

45:36.191 --> 45:38.026
Seriously, what is this?

45:38.235 --> 45:40.404
You always came
to the construction site

45:40.571 --> 45:42.448
and now the office too?

45:43.157 --> 45:46.326
I know you two are newlyweds,
but you two must get along so well.

45:46.410 --> 45:47.244
I envy you.

45:48.245 --> 45:49.246
What is it?

45:50.164 --> 45:51.707
You look very good today.

45:53.417 --> 45:55.544
You look great in those clothes.

45:55.627 --> 45:58.297
-This is the Honorary Chairman.
-He's here? Where?

46:01.258 --> 46:03.051
What kind of joke is this?

46:03.844 --> 46:04.678
It's true.

46:06.430 --> 46:08.265
Come on.
Why are you being like that?

46:08.515 --> 46:10.726
Will the meeting be held here?

46:12.144 --> 46:13.771
Where should I sit?

46:14.730 --> 46:15.564
Center.

46:16.774 --> 46:17.900
Center?

46:18.859 --> 46:20.360
The middle, in the center.

46:20.819 --> 46:21.653
Okay.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.323
See you when I'm done.

46:29.912 --> 46:30.788
It's really true.

46:32.247 --> 46:33.081
Wait.

46:34.041 --> 46:34.875
Really?

46:34.958 --> 46:37.211
I had no idea
you'd be so young.

46:38.629 --> 46:40.339
How? At such a young age...

46:41.715 --> 46:43.675
I kept myself hidden for too long,
didn't I?

46:44.593 --> 46:47.471
I started this work
because I trusted Chairman Shin Sung-kyu.

46:48.055 --> 46:49.807
He did such a good job

46:49.932 --> 46:51.934
that I didn't need to step in.

46:53.268 --> 46:55.270
I provided the funds.

46:55.771 --> 46:57.731
I don't know much
about this line of work.

46:59.024 --> 46:59.858
Now...

47:01.860 --> 47:03.570
we had an unfortunate turn of events

47:04.446 --> 47:05.948
and now I am meeting all of you.

47:08.992 --> 47:12.287
I really don't know anything
about this industry.

47:13.539 --> 47:17.000
I will trust the opinions
of all you board members.

47:18.377 --> 47:19.503
Let's start the meeting.

47:23.423 --> 47:24.258
Se-young.

47:31.473 --> 47:32.307
What's wrong?

47:33.600 --> 47:34.434
Look at me.

47:38.564 --> 47:39.606
Come on.

47:41.942 --> 47:44.361
I pretended not to notice
because you acted so strong.

47:46.697 --> 47:48.156
It's been very hard, right?

47:51.660 --> 47:52.744
Dad...

47:55.747 --> 47:58.333
would have liked
seeing So-joon here.

48:01.587 --> 48:04.464
He told him to come
when he was alive and he never did.

48:05.757 --> 48:06.592
That jerk.

48:12.681 --> 48:13.515
Hey.

48:14.600 --> 48:15.559
Your dad...

48:17.144 --> 48:19.771
would be even happier to see
that you're back here.

48:42.044 --> 48:43.378
I miss him so much.

48:49.384 --> 48:50.302
Thanks for coming.

48:51.553 --> 48:53.847
Why the face?
Did the board members bother you?

48:53.931 --> 48:56.600
Why would they bother me?
They were so good to me.

48:57.309 --> 48:59.478
Where did Ma-rin go?

48:59.561 --> 49:01.563
She wasn't in the office.
Call her.

49:02.230 --> 49:03.482
Let's all go eat together.

49:03.857 --> 49:05.108
You two should go for now.

49:05.484 --> 49:07.986
Yeah, come on.
How come you have no sense?

49:08.070 --> 49:09.529
They got into a fight.

49:09.613 --> 49:11.865
We need to give them time to make up.

49:12.574 --> 49:14.368
-You and I can go on a date.
-What?

49:16.244 --> 49:17.204
We'll get going now.

49:21.333 --> 49:23.043
-Have a nice date.
-Okay!

49:41.937 --> 49:43.939
"Realtor"

49:55.033 --> 49:55.909
Don't go.

49:56.576 --> 49:57.661
You don't have to go.

50:02.582 --> 50:03.417
I'm sorry.

50:32.571 --> 50:34.448
Thank you for all your work today.

50:35.115 --> 50:36.742
You should all head home.

50:37.909 --> 50:38.744
Hello.

50:39.286 --> 50:41.413
-Hello.
-Is Ma-rin inside, by any chance?

50:42.622 --> 50:44.458
Oh, Photographer Song?

50:45.000 --> 50:46.334
Please, speak comfortably.

50:47.002 --> 50:48.336
It's a bit awkward for me.

50:49.004 --> 50:52.549
I don't think anyone is inside.
We just tidied up and came out.

50:52.966 --> 50:55.093
So, no one is inside?

50:55.469 --> 50:57.846
I'll go inside
and check once more.

50:57.929 --> 50:59.890
It's okay. I'll check.

51:00.223 --> 51:01.058
Thank you.

51:02.267 --> 51:03.477
Is anyone out there?

51:05.353 --> 51:06.813
Someone's up here!

51:30.170 --> 51:32.047
Where did she go
without her phone?

51:33.924 --> 51:36.426
Ma-rin.

51:40.430 --> 51:41.264
Where is she?

51:43.350 --> 51:46.186
I'm on the roof!
Please open the door.

51:48.063 --> 51:49.106
I'm so cold.

51:50.816 --> 51:54.694
Do I have to spend the night here?
I'm not going to freeze to death, am I?

51:55.362 --> 51:56.404
What do I do?

52:04.871 --> 52:05.789
I'll be okay.

52:06.748 --> 52:08.333
Just get through the night.

52:09.626 --> 52:11.211
It's not the middle of winter yet.

52:13.046 --> 52:17.467
Even if you get caught by a tiger,
you just need to stay alert.

52:18.677 --> 52:20.470
It's too cold for that saying.

52:22.639 --> 52:24.516
That old saying is so useless.

52:25.684 --> 52:27.686
Why am I suffering here like this?

52:28.436 --> 52:30.063
So-ri's place is better than this.

52:31.189 --> 52:32.065
Ma-rin...

52:32.899 --> 52:33.859
Song Ma-rin!

52:34.025 --> 52:34.901
I'm here!

52:35.944 --> 52:37.112
I'm on the roof!

52:41.908 --> 52:43.076
Here.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.286
It's locked.

52:44.953 --> 52:46.580
It's okay. I'm here.

52:47.455 --> 52:48.623
I'm saved.

52:50.458 --> 52:52.043
What are you even doing there?

52:53.044 --> 52:54.921
I came to get some air
and got locked out.

52:55.881 --> 52:58.633
Why did you stay there
until they locked up?

52:59.092 --> 53:01.428
Just open the door.
I'm so cold.

53:01.761 --> 53:03.513
Okay. Hold on a moment.

53:04.848 --> 53:07.017
Are you going to break the door down?

53:07.475 --> 53:08.852
I'll step back then.

53:09.227 --> 53:10.979
How can I break down a metal door?

53:12.022 --> 53:12.898
Hello.

53:13.398 --> 53:16.026
There's a locked door here.

53:16.902 --> 53:18.904
The roof of the Happiness building.

53:18.987 --> 53:20.572
Why aren't you saying anything?

53:21.323 --> 53:22.657
You didn't leave, did you?

53:22.741 --> 53:24.034
Please come quickly.

53:24.367 --> 53:25.577
Thank you. Hurry.

53:26.620 --> 53:28.788
If you leave now,
you're not even a human being.

53:30.832 --> 53:32.834
That punk must have really left.

53:34.628 --> 53:35.879
That punk is right here.

53:36.421 --> 53:38.340
Hold on a little longer.
I called someone.

53:39.507 --> 53:40.926
I'm so cold I could die.

53:42.594 --> 53:43.511
Are you that cold?

53:44.429 --> 53:47.557
Then try jumping in place
like this.

53:48.141 --> 53:50.060
One, two.

53:50.227 --> 53:52.812
You have to sweat to stay warm.

53:53.021 --> 53:55.232
Or try jumping
as high as you can.

53:55.482 --> 53:58.276
Like this. One... two.

53:59.819 --> 54:01.821
Ma-rin, are you listening?

54:03.448 --> 54:04.449
Answer me.

54:04.783 --> 54:06.451
-Yu So-joon.
-Yeah?

54:08.245 --> 54:09.746
Let me ask you one thing.

54:13.291 --> 54:16.378
What did you see in the future?

54:20.757 --> 54:24.678
I came up here and I thought
and thought about it.

54:25.220 --> 54:26.429
Then thought again.

54:27.681 --> 54:29.683
I didn't even hear them lock the door.

54:30.433 --> 54:31.768
I was thinking so hard.

54:34.854 --> 54:37.065
I wondered why you'd be doing this to me.

54:37.816 --> 54:39.651
There's no way
you'd be doing this to me.

54:40.402 --> 54:42.404
I have that much faith in you.

54:44.447 --> 54:45.282
And no matter

54:46.574 --> 54:49.494
how much I think about it,
I came to only one conclusion.

54:52.872 --> 54:56.584
You went on that subway
and saw something bad, right?

55:03.591 --> 55:05.427
Yes, you're right.

55:12.434 --> 55:13.685
But, you know what?

55:14.894 --> 55:16.521
I'm not curious at all.

55:17.564 --> 55:20.984
I don't want to hear
what your problems are.

55:23.403 --> 55:26.948
Do you know what I thought
before bed last night?

55:29.492 --> 55:31.077
I wish tomorrow wouldn't come.

55:32.996 --> 55:34.456
If it's going to be this hard...

55:35.832 --> 55:37.876
I wish tomorrow would never come.

55:40.170 --> 55:43.757
I can't afford to worry
about tomorrow.

55:44.049 --> 55:45.592
I can barely breathe right now.

55:46.634 --> 55:48.261
You must feel quite at ease now.

55:48.887 --> 55:50.722
You can afford
to worry about the future.

55:56.478 --> 55:59.397
Things could get harder for you
in the future because of me.

56:00.607 --> 56:01.983
I told you I'm not curious.

56:04.652 --> 56:05.945
I met the future you.

56:16.039 --> 56:16.873
Me?

56:21.002 --> 56:22.295
In the future...

56:23.880 --> 56:27.675
you told me to go back
and break up with you.

56:34.224 --> 56:37.811
That was why you were so cold to me?

56:45.819 --> 56:47.570
-It's open.
-Thank you.

56:48.196 --> 56:49.823
-Be careful.
-Bye now.

56:53.743 --> 56:55.328
You're really cold, right?

56:55.912 --> 56:57.789
Are you okay? Put this on.

56:58.415 --> 56:59.457
I'm not okay.

57:00.625 --> 57:01.793
You met another woman.

57:04.129 --> 57:04.963
What?

57:11.636 --> 57:12.595
This is me.

57:14.389 --> 57:17.892
I'm standing in front of you
and you can reach out and touch me.

57:19.394 --> 57:20.979
I'm looking into your eyes.

57:24.190 --> 57:25.108
Future me?

57:26.025 --> 57:28.111
That wench saying nonsense
in the other world?

57:29.154 --> 57:29.988
That's not me.

57:30.071 --> 57:31.156
Aren't you scared?

57:32.073 --> 57:34.951
Things will get hard for you later
and you'll come to regret it.

57:35.034 --> 57:37.203
It gets hard for me
because you act like this.

57:38.538 --> 57:40.999
You wavering like this
is what scares me the most.

57:45.253 --> 57:46.463
Let's keep this short.

57:47.213 --> 57:49.174
Choose a side now.
Is it her or me?

57:50.633 --> 57:51.759
Is it her or me?

57:52.719 --> 57:54.637
-It's not like that.
-I don't care.

57:56.055 --> 57:59.767
I don't like you seeing two people.
Is it her or me?

58:02.103 --> 58:03.855
I don't know either.

58:05.064 --> 58:08.568
Is the present important
or the future?

58:12.655 --> 58:14.616
You have to think
about something like this?

58:15.950 --> 58:17.160
Think carefully.

58:18.286 --> 58:19.871
You cheating idiot.

58:24.167 --> 58:25.001
Ma-rin.

58:46.981 --> 58:49.359
That is so funny.
It's my daughter.

58:50.151 --> 58:52.654
My pretty daughter.
Oh, Bap-soon.

58:53.112 --> 58:54.072
Mom?

58:54.155 --> 58:56.366
I'm at your aunt's restaurant.

58:56.449 --> 58:58.368
I'm having pork ribs and soju.

59:00.328 --> 59:01.162
What?

59:05.667 --> 59:08.545
What's wrong with your voice?
Did you cry?

59:08.962 --> 59:11.089
What? That little weasel.

59:11.506 --> 59:13.383
Seriously, that punk.

59:13.591 --> 59:16.970
I called him my son and gave him
all of my affection and now what?

59:17.554 --> 59:19.389
This is how he repays me?

59:19.472 --> 59:21.683
I'm going to pull out
his prostate and stretch it

59:21.766 --> 59:23.268
into a clothes-drying line.

59:33.778 --> 59:34.612
Hello.

59:36.030 --> 59:36.864
Son.

59:37.115 --> 59:37.991
Yes, Mother.

59:38.116 --> 59:39.617
You actually called me "mother?"

59:40.118 --> 59:42.370
-Pardon me?
-Come to my house now!

59:44.706 --> 59:46.541
Hello? Mother?

59:48.751 --> 59:50.753
How dare he make my daughter cry.

59:51.170 --> 59:53.172
He better not show up.
I'll break his legs.

59:54.549 --> 59:56.092
He's here.

1:00:02.515 --> 1:00:05.393
Mother, why are you out here waiting?

1:00:05.518 --> 1:00:06.561
What's this about?

1:00:06.853 --> 1:00:08.396
-Did you cheat?
-What?

1:00:08.521 --> 1:00:11.065
I heard you saw another woman.
I heard everything.

1:00:11.482 --> 1:00:12.358
Who said that?

1:00:13.484 --> 1:00:15.486
-Was it Ma-rin?
-Is it important who said it?

1:00:15.945 --> 1:00:17.405
Mother, that's not it.

1:00:17.488 --> 1:00:19.866
You think it's okay
because it's not illegal anymore?

1:00:19.949 --> 1:00:21.868
What do you mean adultery, Mother?

1:00:21.993 --> 1:00:24.787
I think there was
a miscommunication.

1:00:25.788 --> 1:00:27.540
What are you doing, Mother?

1:00:27.624 --> 1:00:30.877
I won't take one step
until you admit the truth.

1:00:31.336 --> 1:00:33.004
This is what your mother is like.

1:00:33.087 --> 1:00:34.547
I'm no average person.

1:00:34.631 --> 1:00:36.591
Why would you make my daughter cry?

1:00:36.674 --> 1:00:40.511
Mother, I really didn't cheat.
I really didn't.

1:00:40.595 --> 1:00:43.806
Do you know what I went through
to raise my Bap-soon?

1:00:44.182 --> 1:00:48.561
-How good was I to you?
-Mother.

1:00:48.686 --> 1:00:50.855
-I ought to just die.
-Mother.

1:00:50.938 --> 1:00:52.106
Please calm down.

1:00:52.190 --> 1:00:54.567
-I want to poke my eyes out.
-Don't do that!

1:00:54.651 --> 1:00:56.527
No, don't. I really didn't.

1:00:56.611 --> 1:00:59.030
You punk. How could you?

1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:01.282
You jerk!

1:01:01.366 --> 1:01:03.368
I didn't do it, Mother.

1:01:03.451 --> 1:01:05.286
You only heard
one side of the story.

1:01:05.370 --> 1:01:06.496
Calm down.

1:01:06.579 --> 1:01:08.122
Please stay still.

1:01:08.206 --> 1:01:09.540
Let go.

1:01:09.624 --> 1:01:13.503
I think Ma-rin did this
to get me in trouble.

1:01:13.878 --> 1:01:15.463
I really didn't do anything.

1:01:15.922 --> 1:01:19.384
We can bring Ma-rin
and all talk together.

1:01:19.467 --> 1:01:21.719
Then you need to tell me
what happened.

1:01:21.844 --> 1:01:25.390
Mother, Ma-rin is all I have.

1:01:25.473 --> 1:01:27.809
I like Ma-rin so much.

1:01:28.184 --> 1:01:31.396
I really cannot live
without Ma-rin.

1:01:36.067 --> 1:01:38.236
Then why did she say those things?

1:01:39.278 --> 1:01:40.947
Was she mistaken?

1:01:42.532 --> 1:01:44.283
Where is Ma-rin right now?

1:01:47.286 --> 1:01:48.663
Did I go too far?

1:01:49.664 --> 1:01:50.581
No.

1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:53.126
A beating is the cure
when you're thoughtful.

1:01:55.002 --> 1:01:57.463
Whatever the case may be,
he probably got in trouble.

1:01:58.506 --> 1:01:59.757
Knowing how my mom is.

1:02:05.930 --> 1:02:07.932
Hey. What's with you?

1:02:08.641 --> 1:02:10.059
Why did you do that?

1:02:10.226 --> 1:02:12.061
Do you know how much I got hit?

1:02:13.187 --> 1:02:14.021
What?

1:02:14.313 --> 1:02:16.232
-I told her the truth.
-What?

1:02:16.315 --> 1:02:19.777
I realized something
when I left home this time.

1:02:20.611 --> 1:02:21.821
It's heartbreaking.

1:02:24.031 --> 1:02:25.241
I'm in pain here.

1:02:25.908 --> 1:02:27.452
I almost had to sleep on a roof.

1:02:27.744 --> 1:02:30.079
-Who rescued you?
-Anyway...

1:02:30.997 --> 1:02:35.042
I'm not going take one step
out of this house.

1:02:36.294 --> 1:02:39.714
-Leave if you don't like it.
-So, it's okay if I suffer?

1:02:39.797 --> 1:02:41.007
Then make your choice.

1:02:41.382 --> 1:02:44.677
Is it that world or here?

1:02:48.556 --> 1:02:51.309
Is it a future you can't touch
or the present?

1:02:53.561 --> 1:02:54.395
Tell me.

1:02:55.354 --> 1:02:56.355
Is it her or me?

1:03:00.026 --> 1:03:01.194
Of course, it's you.

1:03:35.311 --> 1:03:37.188
I'm not going
to the other world anymore.

1:03:37.271 --> 1:03:38.940
<i>You're quitting</i>
<i>on the other world?</i>

1:03:39.357 --> 1:03:42.610
I'm betting that you'll be back
on the subway within three days.

1:03:42.693 --> 1:03:44.779
So-joon changed
after getting hit by my mom.

1:03:44.862 --> 1:03:48.699
That's exactly how I feel.
You're just like me.

1:03:48.783 --> 1:03:51.369
We'll think about tomorrow
when tomorrow comes.

1:03:51.911 --> 1:03:53.454
I can't stop now.

1:03:53.996 --> 1:03:55.706
Chairman needs to disappear now.

1:03:56.207 --> 1:04:01.087
How can I forget the brightest time
when I was loved?

1:04:02.046 --> 1:04:03.548
If you're watching this...<i> </i>

1:04:04.549 --> 1:04:07.093
it must mean that
I'm not by your side.

1:04:08.553 --> 1:04:09.387
Just...

1:04:12.765 --> 1:04:14.559
wait until you forget me.

1:04:16.394 --> 1:04:17.436
Also, I love you.

1:04:20.731 --> 1:04:21.691
I love you.
