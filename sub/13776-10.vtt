WEBVTT

00:00.331 --> 00:03.570
The answer's here.
It's here. Come on!

00:03.690 --> 00:04.689
What are you doing?

00:04.805 --> 00:06.004
I have a lineup problem.

00:06.124 --> 00:07.908
I-I got everything
but the flex.

00:07.909 --> 00:09.993
It's between Lamar
Miller or Greg Jennings.

00:09.994 --> 00:11.628
There are rankings
Web sites for this.

00:11.629 --> 00:14.331
The rankings Web sites list
them as equal, but they're not.

00:14.332 --> 00:16.332
I just have to figure out
the right calculations.

00:16.334 --> 00:18.535
And which calculation
is you writing "Miller" and

00:18.536 --> 00:19.720
"Jennings" over and over again?

00:19.721 --> 00:20.721
Please.

00:20.722 --> 00:22.339
Really a beautiful mind at work.

00:22.340 --> 00:23.340
Yeah, Russell Browe.

00:23.341 --> 00:26.560
So funny to watch you
obsess over trivial pursuits,

00:26.561 --> 00:28.845
where I have given myself
to the greater good.

00:28.846 --> 00:30.847
You know, today I'm working
with the Caring Comrades.

00:30.848 --> 00:31.515
That's great.

00:31.516 --> 00:34.151
You do a lot of calf implants, give
that money to someone who needs it.

00:34.152 --> 00:36.153
No, no, no, I'm not
giving money, Pete.

00:36.154 --> 00:37.738
I'm giving my friendship.

00:37.739 --> 00:38.355
What?

00:38.356 --> 00:39.356
I'm working with Donald.

00:39.357 --> 00:40.440
He, uh, has ALS.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.525
Lou Gehrig's disease.

00:41.526 --> 00:44.227
Today, today, today... I
feel like the most, most,

00:44.228 --> 00:46.163
most... unlucky
man in the world.

00:46.781 --> 00:48.865
I think the key with donations,
Andre, is it has to

00:48.866 --> 00:49.899
be something they actually want.

00:49.900 --> 00:51.535
You can't donate a
punch in the face.

00:51.536 --> 00:52.536
He loves this.

00:52.537 --> 00:55.505
He's confined to a hospital bed,
but he gets to experience Dre

00:55.506 --> 00:56.840
Town through me.

00:56.841 --> 00:58.908
So, by comparison, he realizes
that his life in the

00:58.909 --> 01:00.344
hospital isn't actually so bad.

01:00.345 --> 01:03.880
I'm offering you an opportunity
to be charitable today.

01:03.881 --> 01:05.098
Pete, are you with me?

01:05.099 --> 01:05.716
I'm good.

01:05.717 --> 01:06.717
Oh, Andre, ask me, ask me.

01:06.718 --> 01:08.352
Okay, Ruxin, would
you come with me?

01:08.353 --> 01:09.353
No!

01:09.354 --> 01:10.354
All right, I'll go with you.

01:10.355 --> 01:10.971
Thank you.

01:10.972 --> 01:13.056
It'll give me a break from this
lineup conundrum, and it'll

01:13.057 --> 01:13.974
look good at work.

01:14.809 --> 01:15.809
Ooh, text from Rachel.

01:15.810 --> 01:17.444
You're still dating that girl?

01:17.445 --> 01:20.113
What is your problem with this girl?
You guys are j... How old is she?

01:20.114 --> 01:21.698
She is 23 years old.

01:21.699 --> 01:23.950
That means that her first <i>Star
Wars</i> film was <i>The Phantom</i>

01:23.951 --> 01:24.901
<i>Menace.</i>

01:24.902 --> 01:26.903
<i>Her R2-D2 is Jar Jar Binks--
I'm good with that.</i>

01:26.904 --> 01:27.904
<i>Oh, Mr.</i>

01:27.905 --> 01:30.490
<i>Pete, the old, old man have
a small penis a-like you?</i>

01:31.492 --> 01:32.492
<i>What's that?</i>

01:32.493 --> 01:33.744
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:35.663 --> 01:37.664
<i>Good afternoon, gentlemen.</i>

01:37.665 --> 01:40.300
<i>Aw, Jesus, Taco, what did you
do to Uncle Frank's van?</i>

01:40.301 --> 01:42.636
<i>I hit the jackpot is what I did.</i>

01:42.637 --> 01:45.639
<i>Guys, when my puppies died, I
was feeling pretty depressed.</i>

01:45.640 --> 01:48.425
<i>Sweeping up dog hair, I was
thinking to myself, "What am I</i>

01:48.426 --> 01:49.726
<i>doing with my life?"</i>

01:49.727 --> 01:50.727
<i>And then it hit me.</i>

01:50.728 --> 01:54.064
<i>I could be sweeping up human
pubic hair that I cut.</i>

01:54.065 --> 01:55.065
<i>No.</i>

01:55.066 --> 01:56.066
<i>That's right, friends.</i>

01:56.067 --> 01:58.151
<i>I'm gonna be a barber
for down there.</i>

01:58.152 --> 01:59.152
<i>Taco, that's insane.</i>

01:59.153 --> 02:01.154
<i>Insane that no one's thought of it?
I know.</i>

02:01.155 --> 02:02.155
<i>It's the perfect business.</i>

02:02.156 --> 02:04.307
<i>I get to recycle the grooming
equipment from my puppy</i>

02:04.308 --> 02:05.409
<i>business, I get to make my own</i>

02:05.410 --> 02:07.828
<i>hours and I'm super
comfortable around genitals.</i>

02:07.829 --> 02:09.830
<i>Oh, you're gonna make your
nut on people's nuts.</i>

02:09.830 --> 02:10.478
<i>Exactly.</i>

02:10.750 --> 02:14.382

02:14.502 --> 02:16.453
<i>Donald, look, I
brought a friend.</i>

02:16.454 --> 02:19.339
<i>This is Kevin, and
this is Donald.</i>

02:19.340 --> 02:20.841
<i>And I am his Caring Comrade.</i>

02:20.842 --> 02:23.343
<i>You mean,
"I'm your Caring Comrade."</i>

02:23.344 --> 02:25.345
Why would you be
<i>my</i> Caring Comrade?

02:25.346 --> 02:27.180
Because you have cancer.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.266
I don't have cancer--
I-I'm just bald.

02:29.267 --> 02:30.267
I told you that.

02:30.268 --> 02:32.636
Then why are you so pale
and sickly looking?

02:32.637 --> 02:33.637
Enough.

02:33.638 --> 02:36.807
Did you notice, though, that his computer
voice sounds a lot like Ruxin's?

02:36.808 --> 02:39.476
My voice is too cold and
emotionless to be a human voice.

02:39.477 --> 02:41.478
Yeah, that's pretty much Ruxin.

02:41.479 --> 02:42.112
Yeah.

02:42.113 --> 02:45.115
So, Donald, would you like to go
out to lunch with the two of us?

02:45.733 --> 02:48.201
If it's not
for charity, I wouldn't have

02:48.202 --> 02:51.238
lunch with you if it was
the only cure for ALS.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.240
That's a good one, buddy.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.241
Fives.

02:55.827 --> 02:56.827
Come on.

02:56.828 --> 02:57.828
This is amazing.

02:57.829 --> 02:58.462
Yeah.

02:58.463 --> 03:00.464
Yeah, give you fifteens
for that one, yeah.

03:00.465 --> 03:02.466
God, Andre, you made it weird.

03:02.467 --> 03:03.550
You made it strange.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.886
He always does.

03:05.887 --> 03:09.589
Why do I always
have goddamn flex problems?

03:09.590 --> 03:11.057
The safe play is Lamar Miller.

03:11.058 --> 03:13.176
But there's something sexy about
that Greg Jennings at home on

03:13.177 --> 03:15.095
Sunday night against
his old team.

03:15.096 --> 03:17.180
Feel like everyone's gonna make
fun of me if I play a wide

03:17.181 --> 03:19.099
receiver instead
of a running back.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.518
Oh, sh...

03:21.519 --> 03:23.436
Oh!

03:23.437 --> 03:24.855
Where am I?

03:24.856 --> 03:26.740
Who's there?

03:26.741 --> 03:28.575
I'm Greg Jennings.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.160
And I'm your flex.

03:30.161 --> 03:32.162
Greg Jennings, are you
sure you're my flex?

03:32.163 --> 03:34.498
Let's take a look at some of the
bad decisions you've made in

03:34.499 --> 03:36.032
fantasy seasons past.

03:36.033 --> 03:39.753
Good luck finding them, Greg.

03:39.754 --> 03:41.621
Andre will never know.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.373
Cheating in fantasy football.

03:43.374 --> 03:44.374
I know. It didn't even help.

03:44.375 --> 03:46.376
It made no difference
whatsoever.

03:46.377 --> 03:49.713
I'm here to help you make better
decisions, starting with me.

03:49.714 --> 03:55.635
If you take my advice, this is how
your fantasy season could turn out.

03:55.636 --> 03:58.104
Oh, wow, Shiva.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.273
Let's clean you up,
you dirty girl.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.775
Showering with Shiva.

04:01.776 --> 04:02.776
I want that, Greg Jennings.

04:02.777 --> 04:03.944
That's my fantasy fantasy.

04:03.945 --> 04:05.946
And it all starts
with one decision.

04:05.947 --> 04:06.563
What?

04:06.564 --> 04:07.564
I'm your flex.

04:07.565 --> 04:09.566
You're so wise, Greg Jennings.

04:09.567 --> 04:10.650
What is the meaning of life?

04:10.651 --> 04:13.737
It's about spending time with your fam...
Am I doing the right thing

04:13.738 --> 04:14.287
with my hair?

04:14.288 --> 04:16.572
I mean, it's not quite
straight, it's not curly.

04:16.574 --> 04:20.243
It's sort of a wavy... Kevin,
I have to leave you now.

04:20.244 --> 04:21.327
No.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.412
Yes.

04:22.413 --> 04:23.413
Oh.

04:23.414 --> 04:27.634
Remember, Kevin, no fantasy team is
a failure if you have a great flex.

04:27.635 --> 04:28.635
Greg Jennings is my flex.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.636
Say it.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.637
Greg Jennings is my flex.

04:30.638 --> 04:31.638
Say it again.

04:31.639 --> 04:32.889
Greg Jennings is my flex.

04:32.890 --> 04:34.090
Yes.

04:34.091 --> 04:36.059
Greg Jennings is my flex.

04:36.060 --> 04:37.894
Greg Jennings is my flex.

04:37.895 --> 04:41.147
Greg Jennings is my...

04:41.148 --> 04:43.066
Shit! Holy shit!

04:43.067 --> 04:45.936
Oh, my God. Oh.

04:45.937 --> 04:48.021
Oh.

04:48.022 --> 04:50.440
That was amazing.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.860
I have clarity.

04:53.861 --> 04:54.861
Hi.

04:54.862 --> 04:57.497
Greg... I had a lovely
day, thank you for asking.

04:57.498 --> 04:58.498
How was yours?

04:58.499 --> 04:59.115
It was great.

04:59.116 --> 05:01.117
I almost got into a
near-fatal car accident.

05:01.118 --> 05:01.751
What?

05:01.752 --> 05:03.753
I saw this truck
coming right at me.

05:03.754 --> 05:04.754
I saw the light coming at me.

05:04.755 --> 05:07.007
Kevin... I would have
been decapitated.

05:07.008 --> 05:08.425
Oh, my God, are you okay?

05:08.426 --> 05:11.678
I saw, with clarity, exactly
who to play in my flex.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.713
Greg Jennings. He spoke to me.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.015
It was awesome, babe.

05:15.016 --> 05:16.132
Yes.

05:16.133 --> 05:18.468
You just had a near-death
experience, saw your whole life

05:18.469 --> 05:21.638
flash before your eyes...
and you saw your lineup?

05:21.639 --> 05:22.639
Yes.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.641
You didn't see your
wife or your kids?

05:24.642 --> 05:25.725
You saw Greg Jennings.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.360
No, I... Mmm.

05:27.361 --> 05:28.361
Y... I saw you.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.363
I think I saw someone
that looked like you.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.515
I was shouting. I was like, "Hey,
Jenny, Greg Jennings and I

05:32.516 --> 05:33.483
are going on a bike ride!

05:33.484 --> 05:34.985
It's a two-seater."

05:34.986 --> 05:36.236
And I saw the-the other ones.

05:36.237 --> 05:37.237
Being your children?

05:37.238 --> 05:38.238
Yes. Ellie and Chalupa.

05:38.239 --> 05:39.239
Christopher.

05:39.240 --> 05:39.873
CB.

05:39.874 --> 05:40.874
Christopher.

05:41.876 --> 05:42.876
Glad you're okay, Kevin.

05:42.877 --> 05:43.910
Thank you.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.379
Thank you so much.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.421
Terrific end to a
Terrific Lady Day.

05:49.541 --> 05:50.154
Mmm.

05:50.274 --> 05:51.107
Right?

05:51.108 --> 05:55.195
So is there something that
you would like me to do?

05:55.196 --> 05:58.064
Mmm, this is really nice,
but I'll think about it.

05:58.065 --> 06:00.450
Mm-hmm.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.410
What are you doing?

06:10.411 --> 06:12.462
I was just trying to give you a
hint that I figured out what I

06:12.463 --> 06:14.414
wanted and it was a
little B-jibbers.

06:14.415 --> 06:15.048
"B-jibbers"?

06:15.049 --> 06:18.051
Yeah, a little BJ Raji, a little...
What are you talking about?

06:18.052 --> 06:18.668
What?

06:18.669 --> 06:19.669
David Blowie?

06:19.670 --> 06:20.754
No, no.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.639
No, I don't want to do that.

06:22.640 --> 06:23.640
Why not, babe?

06:23.641 --> 06:25.058
Your bush is brambly.

06:25.059 --> 06:27.227
And I go down there,
I can't breathe.

06:27.228 --> 06:28.728
And it pokes my eye.

06:28.729 --> 06:29.930
Just trim that thing.

06:29.931 --> 06:30.931
It's thick.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.933
I'm not gonna trim
my pubic hair.

06:32.934 --> 06:33.934
I do it for you.

06:33.935 --> 06:37.103
And I'm so grateful that you do,
whether it's the breadstick

06:37.104 --> 06:38.488
or the pizza slice.

06:38.489 --> 06:41.658
But I'm working with a calzone--
it's natural, it's manly.

06:41.659 --> 06:43.026
You need to trim it.

06:43.027 --> 06:45.028
Okay, I'll trim it, I promise.

06:45.029 --> 06:47.030
But tonight, you've had
a Terrific Lady Day.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.833
Can I just get a
Terrific Man Minute?

06:49.834 --> 06:51.585
Fine.

06:51.586 --> 06:54.337
I'll just give myself a
Terrific Man 30 Seconds.

06:54.338 --> 06:56.339
Well, bring your weed whacker.

06:56.340 --> 06:59.092
I'm not afraid of doing
my own yard work.

06:59.093 --> 07:01.711
Rachel, that was the best
handcuff party I've ever been to.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.713
That was the <i>only</i> handcuff
party you've ever been to.

07:03.714 --> 07:06.349
All right, that might be...
Look, I found a bed.

07:06.350 --> 07:07.550
Oh, my gosh, what happened?

07:08.552 --> 07:10.804
Now, you have done
so much for me.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.138
What can I do for you?

07:12.139 --> 07:14.691
Oh, I don't know.

07:17.144 --> 07:18.695
Why are you tapping my head?

07:20.615 --> 07:23.450
Oh, okay, I get it.

07:23.451 --> 07:24.451
I get it, sure.

07:24.452 --> 07:25.452
I know this move.

07:25.453 --> 07:26.453
Mmm.

07:26.454 --> 07:27.787
Put the old tie back.

07:27.788 --> 07:28.405
Ah.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.407
Okay.

07:30.408 --> 07:34.494
Wow, these are really... tiny.

07:36.163 --> 07:38.965
Um, are those frosted tips?

07:38.966 --> 07:40.967
Do you like 'em?

07:40.968 --> 07:42.969
Have you been to a place
called Pubercuts?

07:42.970 --> 07:44.587
Maybe I have and
maybe I haven't.

07:44.588 --> 07:45.588
Wait, that's a "T."

07:45.589 --> 07:47.590
That's-that's the "Taco
by Taco" promotion.

07:47.591 --> 07:48.591
Oh, you know Taco?

07:48.592 --> 07:49.592
You should try it.

07:49.593 --> 07:51.311
Uh, uh, no, no, thank you, okay?

07:51.312 --> 07:53.379
I've used Taco's homemade
deodorant-- I'm not letting him

07:53.380 --> 07:54.314
put scissors down there.

07:54.315 --> 07:56.349
Pubic barbershops are, like,
totally in right now.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.400
Yeah, they're in a van.

07:57.401 --> 07:58.401
It's mobile.

07:58.402 --> 07:59.402
They come to you.

07:59.403 --> 08:00.570
You don't get this, do you?

08:00.571 --> 08:01.855
No, I think you don't get it.

08:01.856 --> 08:02.522
Oh.

08:02.523 --> 08:03.690
I'm just... I'm gonna go.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.191
You can keep my tiny underwear.

08:05.192 --> 08:07.577
I'll see you later.

08:10.064 --> 08:11.448
Taco.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.084
Bam! Touchdown, Greg
Jennings, from the flex.

08:14.085 --> 08:15.201
Deal with that.

08:15.202 --> 08:17.837
Wow. You should have a near-death
flexperience more often.

08:17.838 --> 08:19.839
I would love to, but Jenny
won't be happy about it.

08:19.840 --> 08:21.841
She didn't even like the
way this one turned out.

08:21.842 --> 08:22.792
Oh, I wonder why.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.045
Maybe it's because, when you
were dying, you didn't think

08:25.046 --> 08:26.046
about your wife and kids.

08:26.047 --> 08:26.963
This is <i>my</i> last moment.

08:26.964 --> 08:29.099
Can't it be about me
and <i>my</i> true fantasies?

08:29.100 --> 08:30.717
Why does your
lineup even matter?

08:30.718 --> 08:31.718
You're gonna be dead.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.720
I'll always play
fantasy football.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.355
I'll set my lineup
from the grave.

08:35.356 --> 08:37.423
Well, good luck in the
afterlife, Ghost Commissioner,

08:37.424 --> 08:38.975
but in this life you
have a very upset wife.

08:38.976 --> 08:39.976
I'll make it up to her.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.695
I'll-I'll take her to
dinner or something.

08:41.696 --> 08:43.697
I'll take her to that place,
Lemon, that you guys went to.

08:43.698 --> 08:45.315
Good luck getting a reservation.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.450
Sofia's sorority sister's the
hostess-- that's the only reason

08:47.451 --> 08:48.034
we got a table.

08:48.035 --> 08:50.036
But if you do go there, you
got to try the escargot.

08:50.037 --> 08:51.654
Taco... Mm-hmm?

08:51.655 --> 08:53.656
Are you trimming Rachel's pubes?

08:53.657 --> 08:55.291
Sorry, Pete, barber-patient
confidentiality.

08:55.292 --> 08:57.911
There is no such thing as
"barber-patient confidentiality."

08:57.912 --> 08:58.912
Oh, there isn't?

08:58.913 --> 09:01.881
Well, then, yes, Rachel has a standing
appointment with me... Oh...

09:01.882 --> 09:04.084
...every Tuesday for a simple
trim and some highlights.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.085
Unless she's on her period.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.720
Then... All right,
you know what?

09:06.721 --> 09:09.339
Enough. Let's just pretend there
is barber-patient confidentiality.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.340
What are you so upset about?

09:10.341 --> 09:12.425
You guys are Eskimo brothers to
begin with-- you both had sex

09:12.426 --> 09:13.343
with Heather.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.344
Very different.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.346
There was sufficient time
between me and Taco.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.347
It's like Chernobyl.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.349
I waited three weeks before I
got into the exclusion zone.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.351
What is the half-life for semen?

09:21.352 --> 09:23.103
I don't understand
what's the big deal.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.188
It's not like I notarized
her vagina or anything.

09:25.823 --> 09:27.907
I mean, professionally, what do
you do with men, though, in

09:27.908 --> 09:29.159
that kind of situation?

09:29.160 --> 09:30.160
Why-why do you ask?

09:30.161 --> 09:32.245
Sofia doesn't like playing
through the rough; she just

09:32.246 --> 09:33.246
wants to be on the green.

09:33.247 --> 09:35.448
Why don't you give Pubercuts a
ring and we'll pencil you in

09:35.449 --> 09:37.617
and I'll take that Questlove
down to a Kevin Hart in 20

09:37.618 --> 09:38.618
minutes.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.620
How 'bout it?

09:45.251 --> 09:48.020
Oh, Ruspin, welcome
to Pubercuts.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.221
Huh? What can I do you for?

09:49.222 --> 09:52.557
Um, honestly, I just was
hoping to get some clippers,

09:52.558 --> 09:54.476
maybe a little advice, and then
we could both be on our way.

09:54.477 --> 09:56.478
Look, Ruxin, this
isn't a Walgreens.

09:56.479 --> 09:57.112
Yeah.

09:57.113 --> 09:58.113
I'm an artist.

09:58.114 --> 10:00.198
How do you know my name is
Ruxin certain times and other

10:00.199 --> 10:01.233
times it's "Ruspin"?

10:01.234 --> 10:02.284
Your name is Ruspin Ruxin.

10:02.285 --> 10:04.286
You think my first
name is Ruspin?

10:04.287 --> 10:06.371
Yeah, but everyone calls you
Ruxin because you don't really

10:06.372 --> 10:07.489
like your first name.

10:07.490 --> 10:08.824
Yeah, that's right, Taco.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.877
Yeah. Look, Ruspin...
Sorry, Ruxin.

10:11.878 --> 10:12.878
Thank you.

10:12.879 --> 10:15.464
You want Sofia's luscious lips
to "B" that "D" ever again?

10:15.465 --> 10:17.666
Let me clean you up and give
her a clear path to it.

10:17.667 --> 10:20.385
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

10:20.386 --> 10:23.221
Okay, now, anything on the
menu catching your eye?

10:23.222 --> 10:24.806
What's the Fu Man Pube?

10:24.807 --> 10:27.426
Fu Man Pube is two thin strips
of hair going around your

10:27.427 --> 10:29.344
"D" all the way
down to your "A."

10:29.345 --> 10:30.979
Just a simple trim, okay, Taco?

10:30.980 --> 10:33.565
All right, let's get you ready
for your first Pubercut.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.068
All right, you comfortable?

10:36.069 --> 10:38.153
No, I feel like I'm about to give
birth to the worst decision

10:38.154 --> 10:39.521
I've ever made.

10:39.522 --> 10:40.906
Ah, that's what they all say.

10:40.907 --> 10:43.909
All right, let's see
what we got here.

10:43.910 --> 10:47.195
Oh, boy. It's like a front
lawn of a foreclosed home.

10:47.196 --> 10:48.447
All right.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.699
Let's just get
you started here.

10:50.700 --> 10:51.700
What is that?

10:51.701 --> 10:52.701
It's a straight razor.

10:52.702 --> 10:55.087
You're not coming close
to me with that.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.088
This is my tool.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.673
You got to trust... Ow.

10:57.674 --> 10:59.458
I'll use the clippers.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.843
Okay, here we go.

11:01.844 --> 11:03.595
Let's get you started.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.381
Okay, so, what do you want
me to do with your taint?

11:06.382 --> 11:07.382
It's pretty messy.

11:07.383 --> 11:09.017
I don't want you
to touch my taint.

11:09.018 --> 11:10.018
Have it your way.

11:10.019 --> 11:12.020
Don't blame me when Sofia
pays it no attention.

11:12.021 --> 11:13.021
Hey, Taco.

11:13.022 --> 11:14.022
Hey, Gus, come on in.

11:14.023 --> 11:15.023
Have a seat.

11:15.024 --> 11:15.891
Can't he wait outside?

11:15.892 --> 11:16.892
I'm not gonna wait outside.

11:16.893 --> 11:17.893
There's a chair in here.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.895
And you want to watch another
dude get his pubes trimmed?

11:19.896 --> 11:21.897
All right, what are you
looking for this week, Gus?

11:21.898 --> 11:23.899
Ooh, I don't know, probably
just a little off the bottom.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.535
If you like what I'm doing here...
Take a look at this.

11:26.536 --> 11:28.153
I'll just move the shaft out...
Jesus, Taco.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.154
Oh, boy.

11:29.155 --> 11:31.156
What? What-what just happened?

11:31.157 --> 11:33.158
I kind of accidentally
gave you the Skrillex.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.160
You shaved half of my pubes off?

11:35.161 --> 11:36.161
I will fix it.

11:36.162 --> 11:37.579
Don't you worry about a thing.

11:37.580 --> 11:38.964
And here we go.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.165
Take a little off there.

11:40.166 --> 11:42.250
And... done.

11:42.251 --> 11:43.635
All better.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.303
Taco, you shaved me bare.

11:45.304 --> 11:47.305
Gave you the
Hairless in Seattle.

11:47.306 --> 11:48.306
Are we done here?

11:48.307 --> 11:49.641
Absolutely. Hot towel?

11:49.642 --> 11:51.309
I don't want a hot towel...
All right, here.

11:53.312 --> 11:54.846
We're in, we're in.

11:55.848 --> 11:56.932
That was fun.

11:56.933 --> 11:59.935
Yeah, I've never been to a place
that has "beer bong" on the menu.

12:00.570 --> 12:02.571
It's fun to try new
things, isn't it?

12:02.572 --> 12:03.572
Yeah, it is.

12:03.573 --> 12:04.573
Yeah.

12:05.575 --> 12:07.576
Let's take this to
the bedroom, huh?

12:07.577 --> 12:08.577
The bedroom? No.

12:08.578 --> 12:10.245
Wh-Whoa. Wha... Whoa.

12:10.246 --> 12:11.413
On the couch.

12:11.414 --> 12:13.365
Okay. You know what?

12:13.366 --> 12:17.669
I am down and all on board
for the "Taco by Taco."

12:17.670 --> 12:18.670
Yeah?

12:18.671 --> 12:19.671
Oh, yes, let's do it.

12:19.672 --> 12:20.672
You are gonna love it.

12:20.673 --> 12:21.289
Mwah.

12:21.290 --> 12:23.291
You know what you're
gonna love even more?

12:23.292 --> 12:23.925
What?

12:23.926 --> 12:24.926
Your "Taco by Rachel."

12:24.927 --> 12:26.928
I don't know what that is, but
I love all things Rachel.

12:27.930 --> 12:28.913
Oh, there we go.

12:28.914 --> 12:29.931
Okay.

12:29.932 --> 12:30.932
Are you ready?

12:30.933 --> 12:32.517
I am ready.

12:32.518 --> 12:33.518
Oh, good.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.520
Okay. Mmm.

12:35.521 --> 12:36.605
Hmm?

12:36.606 --> 12:38.390
What-what is that?

12:38.391 --> 12:41.393
Is that, like, some weird
Japanese cell phone or something?

12:41.394 --> 12:43.645
I am going to shave you.

12:43.646 --> 12:45.864
Wh... Oh, no, no, no,
I've never done that.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.867
I, uh... No, no, that's... Hey,
there's a first time for everything.

12:48.868 --> 12:49.868
Oh, wait, does it hurt?

12:49.869 --> 12:52.621
How does... No, it hurts a little bit
the first time, but I promise it

12:52.622 --> 12:53.989
feels so good after that.

12:53.990 --> 12:54.990
Can we just talk about it?

12:54.991 --> 12:55.991
Can you please trust me?

12:55.992 --> 12:57.075
I want to trust you.

12:57.076 --> 12:59.127
I just want my first time
to be special, you know?

12:59.128 --> 13:00.128
It will be so special.

13:00.129 --> 13:01.129
Mmm.

13:01.130 --> 13:02.113
I will be so gentle.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.131
Mmm.

13:03.132 --> 13:04.132
I promise.

13:04.133 --> 13:06.134
Uh, can we start with
just the tip, please?

13:06.135 --> 13:07.219
Just the tip.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.303
Mmm, okay.

13:08.304 --> 13:09.337
I'll go so slow.

13:09.338 --> 13:10.338
Okay.

13:11.340 --> 13:12.841
Ooh.

13:14.393 --> 13:18.430
Ooh... Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh...
Ooh, it's so good.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.598
Oh, it feels weird.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.100
Mm, please, shh, shh...
Oh, my God.

13:22.101 --> 13:23.101
Whew. So much pubic hair.

13:23.102 --> 13:25.103
Can you guys take some
of this home with you?

13:25.104 --> 13:25.737
No.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.405
What do you want us to
do with the pubic hair?

13:27.406 --> 13:29.407
I don't know, stuff
some pillows with it.

13:29.408 --> 13:30.025
It's fluffy.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.193
Oh, make a crafternoon of it?

13:31.194 --> 13:33.745
Guys, you are not gonna
believe what happened to me.

13:33.746 --> 13:34.746
What?

13:34.747 --> 13:36.164
Rachel date-shaved me.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.084
This is not funny.

13:39.085 --> 13:41.319
She got me drunk, she took out
the clippers, and before I knew

13:41.320 --> 13:43.922
it, zip-- I had the
full-on Baby Geoffrey.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.707
I was violated and
I was deflowered.

13:45.708 --> 13:46.708
Please, you were deforested.

13:46.709 --> 13:49.344
Amateurs should not be clearing
that kind of heavy brush.

13:49.345 --> 13:51.963
Great, well, if you're the expert,
then get over here and fix it.

13:51.964 --> 13:54.015
The best I could do for you is
I could transfer some of the

13:54.016 --> 13:55.600
hair from your head
down to your crotch.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.602
You're gonna give me
a pubic hair wig?

13:57.603 --> 13:58.937
Mm-hmm. Hair's hair.

13:58.938 --> 14:00.138
A regular Vidal Buffoon.

14:00.139 --> 14:01.139
This sucks.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.140
I'm, like, on the I.R. now.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.676
It's gonna be three weeks before
I get a Howie Long going,

14:04.677 --> 14:06.895
another two years before
I get my Polamalu back.

14:06.896 --> 14:07.896
It's so itchy, too.

14:07.897 --> 14:09.531
Ruxin, how are you
dealing with this?

14:09.532 --> 14:11.950
Sofia's got this Puerto Rican
agave root formula that's

14:11.951 --> 14:14.286
supposed to stimulate growth,
so, uh, I'm all taken care of.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.287
Can you get me some?

14:15.288 --> 14:15.904
No.

14:15.905 --> 14:17.956
I'm your friend and I'm
in pain over here.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.958
I don't care about
your penis, Pete!

14:19.959 --> 14:23.211
Enough with the Puerto Rogaine
stuff-- I have a real issue.

14:23.212 --> 14:26.548
I need you to tell Sofia we need a
reservation for that Lemon place.

14:26.549 --> 14:28.049
No, no more favors, okay?

14:28.050 --> 14:30.418
This is not a great time
to ask Sofia for favors.

14:30.419 --> 14:32.671
Last night's unveiling
didn't go so well.

14:32.672 --> 14:35.307
Oh, Lady Ruxin did not
enjoy the Baby Geoffrey.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.392
My penis does not
look like my son's.

14:37.393 --> 14:39.844
He doesn't have the meaty
clackers that I'm working with.

14:39.845 --> 14:41.346
They haven't descended yet.

14:41.347 --> 14:44.649
I'm sure eventually he will grow
the big, beautiful meatballs

14:44.650 --> 14:45.684
that I have, all right?

14:45.685 --> 14:47.269
Sounds like someone has
testicular hubris.

14:47.270 --> 14:49.387
Well, I don't really give a shit
because I need some of that

14:49.388 --> 14:51.189
special juice to
make my pubes grow.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.824
And I need a Lemon reservation.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.826
No, no, no. Nobody's happy
unless this guy's happy.

14:54.827 --> 14:55.827
You're never happy.

14:55.828 --> 14:56.444
Yeah.

14:56.445 --> 14:57.779
Exactly.

14:58.781 --> 15:00.865
You know, I think I know of a
way that we can get Ruxin to

15:00.866 --> 15:03.451
call Sofia for us.

15:03.452 --> 15:05.921
Guys, guys, no, no, no,
we cannot do this.

15:05.922 --> 15:06.904
Come on.

15:06.905 --> 15:08.290
We cannot do this.

15:08.291 --> 15:10.959
Special
straw forever unsanitary.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.961
Holy shit, he sounds
just like Ruxin.

15:12.962 --> 15:14.596
What did I tell you, man, huh?

15:14.597 --> 15:16.478
Hey, Donald, it's me, Kevin.

15:16.598 --> 15:17.598
And this is my buddy, Pete.

15:17.599 --> 15:20.601
We were hoping to borrow your voice
so we could call our friend's wife.

15:20.602 --> 15:22.603
Donald, you don't
need to do this.

15:22.604 --> 15:24.021
Shut it, chemo.

15:25.023 --> 15:25.639
Great.

15:25.640 --> 15:27.641
What do you say,
Comrade, help us out?

15:27.642 --> 15:28.976
What's in it for me?

15:28.977 --> 15:30.144
I don't... I don't know.

15:30.145 --> 15:31.145
Whatever you want.

15:31.146 --> 15:31.779
Yeah.

15:31.780 --> 15:33.197
Is the wife hot?

15:33.198 --> 15:34.615
Yeah. Latin.

15:34.616 --> 15:37.618
Donald's disease makes it
impossible for him to get aroused.

15:37.619 --> 15:38.702
Not true.

15:38.703 --> 15:40.287
I get aroused up here.

15:40.288 --> 15:41.288
That's really creepy.

15:41.289 --> 15:42.289
All right, let's do this.

15:42.290 --> 15:43.907
Well, we'll just get
this out of the way.

15:43.908 --> 15:44.908
I'll get Sofia on speaker.

15:44.909 --> 15:45.909
You hang tight.

15:45.910 --> 15:47.911
You're gonna get me kicked
out of Caring Comrades.

15:47.912 --> 15:48.912
We don't give a shit.

15:49.998 --> 15:51.382
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

15:53.385 --> 15:55.386
Hey, babe.

15:55.387 --> 15:56.003
Hey.

15:56.004 --> 15:59.506
Can you call your friend at Lemon and
get us a reservation for Friday?

15:59.507 --> 16:00.674
Really? You want to go again?

16:00.675 --> 16:02.760
Put the reservation
under Kevin's name.

16:02.761 --> 16:04.094
Kevin and Jenny might join us.

16:04.095 --> 16:05.980
Oh, God, are you kidding me?

16:05.981 --> 16:07.431
You know how I feel about them.

16:07.432 --> 16:09.016
What the...?

16:09.017 --> 16:10.768
I do?

16:10.769 --> 16:13.737
What's the deal with that agave
stuff you put in your hair after

16:13.738 --> 16:15.272
that bad haircut?

16:15.273 --> 16:17.324
Um, I-I got that when
I was back home.

16:17.325 --> 16:18.525
Why?

16:18.526 --> 16:20.194
Back to Kevin and Jenny.

16:20.195 --> 16:22.196
Remind me what your
issue is with them.

16:22.197 --> 16:23.664
But, first, the hair formula.

16:23.665 --> 16:24.698
Where can I get some?

16:24.699 --> 16:26.116
Restaurant. Hair stuff.

16:26.117 --> 16:27.117
Rod... Rod-Rodney?

16:27.118 --> 16:29.703
Skittle-kylock-forkman-zebn,
K-K-K-K.

16:29.704 --> 16:30.704
Stop it.

16:30.705 --> 16:31.885
Babe, you sound
really stressed out.

16:31.897 --> 16:32.987
Are you okay?

16:33.107 --> 16:34.374
I am pretty stressed.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.009
Maybe you can help me relax.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.198
Over the phone.

16:37.433 --> 16:38.424
You mean like...

16:38.677 --> 16:40.436
- phone sex?
- Oh, God.

16:40.556 --> 16:41.637
Yeah.

16:42.153 --> 16:44.834
- Phone sex.
- Okay, I mean it's

16:44.954 --> 16:47.116
better than sticking my face
in your tumbleweed.

16:47.986 --> 16:49.843
So what are you wearing?

16:49.963 --> 16:51.404
I'm wearing that low-cut

16:51.442 --> 16:53.670
red and white dress that you like
so much.

16:53.720 --> 16:54.598
What are you wearing?

16:54.638 --> 16:55.658
Red wind breaker,

16:55.778 --> 16:58.251
- and some khakis.
- You can lie, Donald.

16:58.371 --> 17:00.104
Weird, but sexy.

17:00.143 --> 17:01.361
I wish I was there

17:01.411 --> 17:03.292
to put my good hand on your breast.

17:03.412 --> 17:05.769
Okay, I am rubbing my breast...

17:05.888 --> 17:08.144
What are you wearing under your dress?

17:08.263 --> 17:11.400
Oh, just a pair of skimpy
yellow lace panties.

17:11.401 --> 17:13.734
Take them off.

17:13.736 --> 17:15.904
Oh, God, I don't want to see
this guy's finger strokes.

17:15.905 --> 17:18.272
Okay, I just took them off.

17:18.273 --> 17:19.858
Holy shit, she did it!

17:19.858 --> 17:20.858
What?

17:20.859 --> 17:23.194
I mean, this is so hot.

17:23.195 --> 17:24.695
It is so hot.

17:24.696 --> 17:26.698
What else would you
like me to do?

17:26.699 --> 17:28.784
Oh, no, we got to... Stop. Ow!

17:28.785 --> 17:31.703
Send me a hot, naked
photo of yourself.

17:31.704 --> 17:35.874
I'm gonna send you a hot,
naked, dirty photo of me.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.093
But you better send me
one in return, Rodney.

17:38.094 --> 17:39.094
Oh, God.

17:39.095 --> 17:40.095
I'm not taking that.

17:40.096 --> 17:42.431
Here goes.

17:44.217 --> 17:46.718
Okay. Now your turn.

17:48.471 --> 17:50.055
Well, hello.

17:50.056 --> 17:52.140
All right, I can do
something with that.

17:52.141 --> 17:54.276
Just gonna
get this guy out.

17:54.277 --> 17:56.278
How 'bout this bird's-eye view?

17:56.279 --> 17:59.815
Now take my medical compression
socks off with your teeth.

17:59.816 --> 18:00.816
Okay, done, done.

18:00.817 --> 18:01.817
This is over.

18:01.818 --> 18:04.653
Thanks, jackass, now I'm
going to get blue balls.

18:04.654 --> 18:05.654
You can't get blue balls.

18:05.655 --> 18:06.738
It's not possible.

18:06.739 --> 18:08.707
Yes, it is. Up here.

18:08.708 --> 18:11.660
How do you
like that, sweetie?

18:12.662 --> 18:15.747
Oh, balls!

18:15.748 --> 18:18.166
Sir, license and registration.

18:18.167 --> 18:19.167
What's the problem, Officer?

18:19.168 --> 18:20.168
You were texting and driving.

18:20.169 --> 18:21.169
Uh, no, sir, I wasn't.

18:21.170 --> 18:22.170
Let me see your phone.

18:22.171 --> 18:23.805
No, why don't you
give me your phone?

18:23.806 --> 18:25.807
Step out of the car right now.

18:25.808 --> 18:27.559
Okay, here we are.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.761
Sir, give me your phone.

18:29.762 --> 18:31.263
Here you go.

18:31.264 --> 18:33.649
Is this child pornography?

18:33.650 --> 18:35.400
No, that's a dick pic.

18:35.401 --> 18:37.569
You're taking pictures
of children's penises?

18:37.570 --> 18:39.571
No, that is my penis.

18:39.572 --> 18:41.440
It just appears childlike.

18:41.441 --> 18:44.526
There's no way that this tiny
thing is a grown man's penis.

18:44.527 --> 18:45.944
It is! See those balls?

18:45.945 --> 18:48.163
Those are a couple
meaty clackers.

18:48.164 --> 18:51.533
It's like when you give a dog a
summer haircut, it looks smaller.

18:51.534 --> 18:52.534
It's still the same dog.

18:52.535 --> 18:53.535
Look, I'll show you, okay?

18:53.536 --> 18:55.537
Sir, sir, really, I don't... Just look!
Just take a peek.

18:56.172 --> 18:57.172
I'm not gay.

18:57.173 --> 18:58.790
I'm just showing you this... No!

18:58.791 --> 19:00.626
God, I hate flex dilemmas.

19:00.627 --> 19:03.095
Pierre Garcon, Wes Welker.

19:03.096 --> 19:04.379
Wes Welker, Pierre Garcon.

19:04.380 --> 19:06.381
Sir, I don't...
Sir, put that away.

19:06.382 --> 19:08.016
Whoa, whoa. Is that Ruxin?

19:08.017 --> 19:09.468
Oh, my God.

19:09.469 --> 19:11.853
Oh, shi...

19:15.058 --> 19:17.109
Hi, Mommy, we love you.

19:17.110 --> 19:18.277
Welcome to your life.

19:18.278 --> 19:21.446
No, no, no, where is my
near-death flexperience?

19:21.447 --> 19:24.199
Pierre Garcon or Wes Welker?

19:24.200 --> 19:25.400
We love you.

19:25.401 --> 19:27.619
Oh, this is bullsh...
...it!

19:29.238 --> 19:33.241
Oh, bullshit. Oh... You should
probably check on that.

19:33.242 --> 19:34.609
Get back here! Get back here!

19:34.729 --> 19:36.244
Come on!

19:36.431 --> 19:38.100
Oh, I'm so happy you're okay.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.638
I was having such a hard time figuring
out who to set Kevin up with.

19:40.639 --> 19:42.182
Dr. Nowzick.

19:42.302 --> 19:46.600
Uh... On behalf of the hospital, I'd
like to talk to you about Donald.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.722
Look, I totally understand if you want
to kick me out of Caring Comrades.

19:49.723 --> 19:53.859
- It was just... - What? No, I want to
thank you for your generous donation.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.311
Thank you.

19:55.312 --> 19:56.896
Here they are.

19:56.897 --> 20:00.149
Oh, boy, look at all these
happy faces in here, huh?

20:00.150 --> 20:01.150
Because of you.

20:01.151 --> 20:02.151
Y-Yeah.

20:02.152 --> 20:05.621
Because of your generosity,
they're having a lot of fun...

20:05.622 --> 20:07.573
Oh, look, they're drawing
hair on their dinosaurs.

20:07.574 --> 20:08.574
Uh, my generosity?

20:08.575 --> 20:11.577
Mm-hmm. I donated all my clippings
to Caring Comrades in your honor.

20:11.578 --> 20:12.578
These are pubic hair wigs?

20:12.579 --> 20:13.579
Yeah.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.581
You can't make pubic hair wigs.

20:15.582 --> 20:16.582
Hair's hair.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.584
How many clients did you have?

20:18.585 --> 20:19.668
That's mostly Ruxin.

20:19.669 --> 20:20.753
His bush was huge.

20:20.754 --> 20:21.754
Oh, my God.

20:21.755 --> 20:24.757
Because of your generosity, we
were able to wig the entire

20:24.758 --> 20:26.892
pediatric cancer ward.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.595
And we had some left
over for Donald.

20:31.481 --> 20:35.017
Look, uh, Donald, I-I can...
I know what it is.

20:35.018 --> 20:36.402
And I like it.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.405
Looking good, Robot Ruxin.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.319
Looking good.

20:40.439 --> 20:51.336
