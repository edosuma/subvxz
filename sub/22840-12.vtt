00:01.930 --> 00:04.771
<i>So Meigs gives the order
to bury the dead</i>

00:04.843 --> 00:06.856
<i>on Robert E. Lee's property.</i>

00:07.368 --> 00:09.280
Oh, boy.

00:09.391 --> 00:10.818
<i>We're gonna go kidnap</i>

00:10.895 --> 00:13.558
<i>Abraham Lincoln's dead-ass body.</i>

00:13.635 --> 00:15.785
Is somebody having sex
next to us?

00:15.906 --> 00:17.738
<i>Elmer McCurdy gets shot
in the chest...</i>

00:17.846 --> 00:21.718
<i>and becomes the bandit
who wouldn't give up.</i>

00:21.795 --> 00:23.335
Oh...

Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Death"</font>

00:40.460 --> 00:42.145
- Here we are.
- All right.

00:42.426 --> 00:45.434
Berg, we're still alive.
Let's do this.

00:46.121 --> 00:48.559
God, I spilled all over
my crotch.

00:48.936 --> 00:50.077
Christ.

00:50.552 --> 00:52.309
Bourbon balls now.

00:56.108 --> 00:57.665
Hello, my name is Steve Berg,

00:57.742 --> 01:00.770
and today we're gonna be
discussing General Meigs...

01:03.972 --> 01:06.059
And the cemetery revenge.

01:06.924 --> 01:07.924
Okay.

01:08.085 --> 01:10.738
<i>Let's take this back to 1837</i>

01:10.858 --> 01:13.207
<i>on the Harbor of St. Louis.</i>

01:13.730 --> 01:15.508
<i>Montgomery Meigs entered</i>

01:15.585 --> 01:17.790
<i>the United States
Engineering Corps,</i>

01:17.867 --> 01:19.336
<i>and one of the first gigs</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:21.984
<i>was... shadowing this big deal dude</i>

01:22.061 --> 01:24.051
<i>named Robert E. Lee,</i>

01:24.652 --> 01:27.117
<i>and Meigs is like,
Oh, Robert E. Lee</i>

01:27.194 --> 01:28.601
<i>is, like,
kind of the cool quarterback.</i>

01:28.678 --> 01:30.465
<i>He's, like, the dude.</i>

01:30.546 --> 01:33.317
<i>He's handsome, he's a leader of men,</i>

01:33.483 --> 01:37.270
<i>and he is the ideal of what
a Christian man should be.</i>

01:37.663 --> 01:39.908
<i>They worked together
the whole summer,</i>

01:39.985 --> 01:41.193
<i>and they became tight,</i>

01:41.270 --> 01:42.817
<i>like a tight-knit crew.</i>

01:43.645 --> 01:47.195
<i>So in mid-May of 1861,</i>

01:47.272 --> 01:50.180
the Civil "Ware"...
the Civil War...

01:50.257 --> 01:52.793
Was about to go down.

01:52.983 --> 01:55.890
<i>When Robert E. Lee says,
*** you, Union arm...</i>

01:55.967 --> 01:59.757
<i>Union army,
I'm going down to be the guy</i>

01:59.834 --> 02:02.593
<i>behind the guys
of the Confederate army.</i>

02:02.670 --> 02:05.297
<i>I'm gonna go
help out a bunch of rednecks</i>

02:05.374 --> 02:06.599
<i>who love slavery</i>

02:06.676 --> 02:08.750
<i>and help them do... do
a bunch of cool shit</i>

02:08.827 --> 02:09.836
that he thought was cool.

02:09.913 --> 02:10.951
I don't think it's cool.

02:11.027 --> 02:12.277
- Okay.
- So...

02:12.354 --> 02:15.570
<i>Montgomery Meigs
gets so pissed off.</i>

02:15.647 --> 02:17.387
<i>He's like, A guy I looked up to,</i>

02:17.694 --> 02:19.926
<i>the guy
who I modeled myself after,</i>

02:20.161 --> 02:22.383
<i>turned out to be one
of the biggest traitors</i>

02:22.460 --> 02:23.552
<i>since Benedict Arnold,</i>

02:23.629 --> 02:26.356
<i>and now I'm fighting against him?</i>

02:27.516 --> 02:30.090
<i>Game on, brother.</i>

02:30.296 --> 02:31.754
<i>Game on.</i>

02:33.378 --> 02:36.845
So at this time
at the Lee estate,

02:36.922 --> 02:39.870
<i>Mary Lee,
wife of Robert E. Lee,</i>

02:39.947 --> 02:42.778
<i>was walking around her
beautiful rose garden.</i>

02:42.883 --> 02:44.804
<i>She was like, This is my joint.</i>

02:44.881 --> 02:47.512
<i>This is my... this is my thing.</i>

02:47.671 --> 02:49.917
<i>This is my thing.
This is my thing I love.</i>

02:50.058 --> 02:51.935
<i>I love this environment.</i>

02:52.012 --> 02:53.557
<i>As far as
the who, what, and where,</i>

02:53.634 --> 02:55.102
<i>this is the "where" I want to be.</i>

02:55.179 --> 02:57.269
<i>The "who" and the "what,"
that's gonna come later.</i>

02:58.615 --> 03:01.750
<i>And Robert E. Lee is like,
Look, Mary, babe,</i>

03:01.827 --> 03:03.164
<i>there's gonna be bloodshed,</i>

03:03.241 --> 03:05.375
<i>brother upon brother
type of shit,</i>

03:05.452 --> 03:08.637
<i>so I'm gonna need you
to wrap it all up</i>

03:08.714 --> 03:10.113
<i>and get the hell out of there.</i>

03:11.212 --> 03:14.840
<i>So Montgomery Meigs gets
made quartermaster general.</i>

03:14.917 --> 03:17.836
<i>He takes his soldiers over
the Potomac,</i>

03:17.913 --> 03:21.258
<i>and they occupy
the Lee residence</i>

03:21.335 --> 03:24.784
<i>and make it kind of the
HQ of the Union army,</i>

03:24.861 --> 03:27.320
<i>and he's like, Yeah,
I'll fucking nail this job,</i>

03:27.397 --> 03:29.879
<i>especially now that
I'm so pissed off</i>

03:30.007 --> 03:32.457
<i>at my mentor, *** Robert.</i>

03:33.336 --> 03:36.257
<i>So in 1864, General...</i>

03:36.334 --> 03:38.132
Oh, boy.

03:38.541 --> 03:39.896
<i>General Robert...</i>

03:39.973 --> 03:41.575
Oh, my God.

03:41.652 --> 03:43.182
I love you, Steve.

03:45.133 --> 03:46.851
So go ahead. So General Lee...

03:46.928 --> 03:47.882
<i>And Ulysses...</i>

03:47.959 --> 03:49.343
<i>Ulysses S. Grant</i>

03:49.420 --> 03:53.438
<i>begin their 40-day
bloodbath massacre.</i>

03:53.515 --> 03:57.292
<i>82,000 people are killed in one month.</i>

03:57.465 --> 03:59.895
<i>Montgomery Meigs had to deal with</i>

03:59.972 --> 04:02.710
<i>all the incoming
Union dead soldiers,</i>

04:02.787 --> 04:05.019
<i>so every soldier
he has to bury</i>

04:05.182 --> 04:09.472
<i>makes him angrier and
angrier at Robert Lee.</i>

04:10.115 --> 04:11.816
<i>And all of a sudden
out of nowhere,</i>

04:11.893 --> 04:14.066
<i>he gets
the dead body of his son.</i>

04:15.444 --> 04:17.253
So Meigs has to bury him.

04:17.850 --> 04:19.212
<i>And Meigs is like...</i>

04:21.432 --> 04:23.305
<i>Should never have to see your...</i>

04:24.052 --> 04:26.016
<i>child go before you.</i>

04:27.203 --> 04:30.684
So Meigs, like
a quasi-madman,

04:30.761 --> 04:32.957
<i>says, I want to make
sure that Robert E. Lee</i>

04:33.034 --> 04:35.207
<i>can never come back,
and that if he does,</i>

04:35.284 --> 04:38.165
<i>he sleeps
among Union ghosts.</i>

04:38.242 --> 04:39.211
<i>Capisce?</i>

04:39.288 --> 04:42.055
<i>Haunting you,
Robert E. Lee.</i>

04:42.169 --> 04:44.893
<i>Meigs gives the order
to his soldiers</i>

04:44.970 --> 04:48.169
to start burying the dead
on Lee's property,

04:48.246 --> 04:50.614
and Meigs is
so excited about this.

04:50.691 --> 04:54.397
He's like, get those dudes
around the house, man,

04:54.474 --> 04:57.175
<i>around the porch,
and dig a giant pit</i>

04:57.252 --> 04:59.830
<i>right under Mary Lee's
beloved rose garden.</i>

04:59.907 --> 05:00.846
<i>Sweet.</i>

05:00.923 --> 05:02.150
<i>That's what we're doing.</i>

05:02.227 --> 05:04.443
<i>That is the whole point
of this situation,</i>

05:04.520 --> 05:06.202
<i>to *** their house.</i>

05:06.279 --> 05:08.204
<i>It's a zombie playground.</i>

05:08.925 --> 05:10.267
<i>It's dark.</i>

05:18.248 --> 05:21.448
<i>So the Civil War
officially ends,</i>

05:21.833 --> 05:23.234
<i>and Robert E. Lee and Mary Lee</i>

05:23.311 --> 05:25.732
<i>find that their precious
land that they loved so much</i>

05:25.809 --> 05:29.537
<i>had been turned into
a graveyard.</i>

05:31.343 --> 05:33.552
<i>And they're like,
are you kidding me?</i>

05:33.629 --> 05:35.010
<i>This guy.</i>

05:35.318 --> 05:36.993
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

05:37.070 --> 05:38.197
<i>Cool.</i>

05:39.569 --> 05:40.699
<i>Fine.</i>

05:41.398 --> 05:43.392
And do you know
what that place became?

05:43.798 --> 05:47.836
<i>It became the Arlington
National Cemetery.</i>

05:48.322 --> 05:49.465
Really?

05:49.950 --> 05:52.312
<i>And Mary Lee's
precious rose garden</i>

05:52.389 --> 05:54.400
<i>became
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</i>

05:56.643 --> 05:57.861
How about that?

05:57.938 --> 05:58.942
<i>Wow.</i>

05:59.019 --> 06:01.845
<i>Arlington National Cemetery,</i>

06:02.408 --> 06:04.611
<i>the heartbeat of America.</i>

06:06.010 --> 06:07.549
The heartbeat?

06:08.271 --> 06:10.126
That is weird, because there is

06:10.203 --> 06:12.236
<i>literally no heartbeats there.</i>

06:14.538 --> 06:16.002
Please let that be it.

06:16.079 --> 06:17.673
Bergie, great job.

06:17.750 --> 06:18.740
Thanks, man.

06:18.817 --> 06:20.727
Arlington National Cemetery.

06:20.804 --> 06:22.242
It's quite a tale.

06:25.895 --> 06:27.212
<i>Will you teach me some</i>

06:27.289 --> 06:28.331
<i>of your language?</i>

06:28.408 --> 06:29.810
Yeah. Okay.

06:32.148 --> 06:34.814
"Drunk History"
with Derek Waters.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.549
Derek Waters.

06:38.626 --> 06:39.647
You tried.

06:39.739 --> 06:42.132
I feel like
my voice was offensive.

06:42.416 --> 06:44.418
- Just don't say anything.
- Okay.

06:44.495 --> 06:46.414
- I get that note a lot.
- Okay, okay.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.279
"Drunk History"

06:49.356 --> 06:51.109
with Derek Waters.

06:52.441 --> 06:53.508
Mm.

06:55.052 --> 06:56.169
That's...

06:56.300 --> 06:57.355
What?

06:58.932 --> 07:01.446
Hello.
My name is Jimmy O. Yang,

07:01.523 --> 07:04.639
and today we're gonna
talk about the kidnapping

07:04.716 --> 07:06.157
of Lincoln's body.

07:06.533 --> 07:07.753
Mm.

07:08.581 --> 07:10.743
That makes you thirsty, huh?

07:12.947 --> 07:15.157
<i>The story began in 19...</i>

07:15.234 --> 07:16.393
<i>no, wait.</i>

07:16.470 --> 07:19.753
<i>1875, uh, in Chicago.</i>

07:19.830 --> 07:22.505
<i>This dude, Big Jim Kennally,</i>

07:22.582 --> 07:24.798
<i>had, like,
the best counterfeiting ring</i>

07:24.875 --> 07:25.871
<i>in Chicago.</i>

07:25.948 --> 07:27.840
But the real man
behind the scene

07:27.917 --> 07:29.360
<i>was this guy named Boyd.</i>

07:29.437 --> 07:32.164
<i>He was the guy
that made the best press,</i>

07:32.241 --> 07:33.989
<i>and his fake bills were
so good</i>

07:34.066 --> 07:35.418
<i>that people would look
at it and be like,</i>

07:35.495 --> 07:37.672
<i>Yeah, it looks like
real money to me.</i>

07:37.831 --> 07:39.577
But it's not.

07:39.654 --> 07:40.822
So...

07:40.899 --> 07:42.420
<i>So they were making
so much money</i>

07:42.497 --> 07:44.377
<i>that the Fed finally
caught up with them,</i>

07:44.454 --> 07:46.573
<i>and then Boyd took the heat.</i>

07:46.650 --> 07:47.948
And he went to jail.

07:48.025 --> 07:49.637
<i>And now Big Jim is like,</i>

07:49.714 --> 07:50.816
<i>Shit.</i>

07:50.893 --> 07:52.616
<i>I just lost my guy.</i>

07:52.693 --> 07:54.961
<i>I don't have
my cash flow anymore.</i>

07:55.038 --> 07:57.219
<i>What can I do about this?</i>

07:57.687 --> 07:59.205
<i>So he went to the saloon</i>

07:59.282 --> 08:01.326
<i>that he owned called The Hub,</i>

08:01.403 --> 08:03.259
<i>and he talked to
a couple of his goons</i>

08:03.336 --> 08:05.719
<i>called Mullen and Hughes.</i>

08:05.954 --> 08:07.400
<i>And he's like, Guys,</i>

08:07.477 --> 08:08.900
<i>we're gonna go kidnap</i>

08:08.977 --> 08:11.915
<i>Abraham Lincoln's
dead-ass body.</i>

08:11.992 --> 08:12.947
<i>Wow.</i>

08:13.024 --> 08:14.102
<i>And we're gonna...</i>

08:14.179 --> 08:15.537
<i>hold it for ransom</i>

08:15.614 --> 08:18.118
<i>for Boyd's release from prison.</i>

08:18.713 --> 08:21.430
<i>And 200 grand.</i>

08:21.839 --> 08:22.857
<i>Boom.</i>

08:22.934 --> 08:24.642
And then his buddies
Mullen and Hughes

08:24.719 --> 08:27.367
<i>were like, Big Jim at it again</i>

08:27.444 --> 08:29.045
<i>with the great ideas.</i>

08:29.122 --> 08:31.857
<i>And in the midst of
that conversation,</i>

08:31.934 --> 08:34.244
<i>this other guy
named Lewis Swegles</i>

08:34.321 --> 08:35.751
<i>came up to them and was like,
Hey, guys.</i>

08:35.828 --> 08:37.371
<i>You guys talking about stealing</i>

08:37.448 --> 08:38.643
<i>Lincoln's body?</i>

08:38.720 --> 08:41.485
<i>'Cause, um,
I don't mean to brag, but...</i>

08:41.650 --> 08:43.575
<i>I am the boss</i>

08:43.652 --> 08:45.135
<i>of body-snatching.</i>

08:45.212 --> 08:46.668
So then Mullen and Hughes was like,

08:46.745 --> 08:47.953
<i>Whoa.</i>

08:48.070 --> 08:49.407
<i>Swegles,</i>

08:49.617 --> 08:51.508
<i>you seem like a legit guy.</i>

08:51.718 --> 08:53.830
<i>Come on in in our crew.</i>

08:53.907 --> 08:56.422
And now
Hughes, Mullen, and Swegles

08:56.499 --> 08:58.420
are now in the kidnapping crew

08:58.497 --> 08:59.977
<i>of Lincoln's dead body.</i>

09:00.229 --> 09:02.750
<i>But little
did Hughes and Mullen know</i>

09:02.827 --> 09:04.652
that Swegles was actually

09:04.729 --> 09:07.395
<i>an informant for the new agency</i>

09:07.472 --> 09:09.133
<i>called the Secret Service.</i>

09:09.337 --> 09:11.420
<i>So he went back to the head</i>

09:11.497 --> 09:13.361
<i>of the Secret Service Agency,</i>

09:13.438 --> 09:15.021
<i>Patrick Tyrrell,</i>

09:15.545 --> 09:18.506
who was from the Tyrell
family of "Game of Thrones."

09:22.064 --> 09:23.584
Do you ever go outside?

09:23.661 --> 09:24.849
Not really.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.393
Mostly video games
and "Game of Thrones."

09:30.270 --> 09:31.270
Okay.

09:31.365 --> 09:34.049
<i>So Swegles... he's like, Yo, Pat,</i>

09:34.126 --> 09:35.506
<i>I got a scoop for you.</i>

09:35.821 --> 09:37.618
<i>These guys are planning to kill</i>

09:37.695 --> 09:38.849
<i>your dead president.</i>

09:39.102 --> 09:41.322
<i>Well, you can't kill a dea... I'm sorry.</i>

09:41.399 --> 09:43.179
<i>These guys are
plotting...</i>

09:43.256 --> 09:45.366
<i>To kidnap your dead president.</i>

09:47.914 --> 09:50.280
<i>You should go catch
their ass red-handed.</i>

09:50.357 --> 09:52.244
<i>So Patrick Tyrrell,</i>

09:52.321 --> 09:53.828
<i>he was super down with this.</i>

09:53.905 --> 09:54.978
<i>He was like, Yes!</i>

09:55.055 --> 09:56.077
<i>This is it.</i>

09:56.154 --> 09:58.035
<i>If we protect t
he dead president,</i>

09:58.112 --> 10:00.570
<i>that means we're protecting
the live president.</i>

10:00.647 --> 10:02.297
<i>This the publicity we need</i>

10:02.374 --> 10:04.099
<i>to cement ourselves</i>

10:04.176 --> 10:06.086
<i>as the goddamn Secret Service</i>

10:06.163 --> 10:08.678
<i>of the United States of America.</i>

10:10.363 --> 10:12.622
<i>So Hughes, Mullen, and Swegles</i>

10:12.699 --> 10:14.389
<i>went to the grave that night.</i>

10:14.502 --> 10:16.458
<i>And the Secret Service
guys were all camped out</i>

10:16.535 --> 10:17.797
<i>around the graveyard</i>

10:17.874 --> 10:20.202
to try to catch these guys red-handed.

10:20.309 --> 10:23.104
<i>And then when the three
guys got to Lincoln's grave</i>

10:23.181 --> 10:24.444
<i>they're like, whoa...</i>

10:25.897 --> 10:29.263
<i>I guess this is how, like,
rich people bury themselves.</i>

10:29.340 --> 10:30.836
<i>It's a mausoleum,</i>

10:30.913 --> 10:32.310
<i>a sarcophagus,</i>

10:32.387 --> 10:33.827
<i>and then a coffin.</i>

10:34.079 --> 10:35.622
<i>Oh, shit. What should we do?</i>

10:35.699 --> 10:37.349
<i>So Mullen took out his axe,</i>

10:37.426 --> 10:39.514
<i>and he was like,
I'm just gonna bash this shit</i>

10:39.591 --> 10:40.984
<i>and take Lincoln's body.</i>

10:41.061 --> 10:42.234
<i>And then Swegles, obviously,</i>

10:42.311 --> 10:43.844
<i>he didn't want to damage
Lincoln's body.</i>

10:43.921 --> 10:45.091
<i>He was like, whoa, whoa, guys.</i>

10:45.168 --> 10:47.121
<i>You can't...
you can't do that, dude.</i>

10:47.198 --> 10:49.301
<i>You know, that's gonna alert...</i>

10:49.378 --> 10:51.211
<i>uh, the graveyard owner,</i>

10:51.288 --> 10:53.229
<i>and we'll have less time to run.</i>

10:53.306 --> 10:54.396
<i>And then Mullen's like,</i>

10:54.473 --> 10:56.304
- <i>You know what?
- You're right.</i>

10:56.381 --> 10:57.925
<i>We're gonna do this...</i>

10:58.092 --> 11:00.051
<i>slightly more...</i>

11:00.397 --> 11:01.469
<i>What's the word?</i>

11:01.546 --> 11:03.495
<i>Like, sophisticated?
Slightly more...</i>

11:03.572 --> 11:04.974
So sophis...
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah.</i>

11:05.051 --> 11:06.747
<i>You know what? You're right.
We're gonna do this with</i>

11:06.824 --> 11:08.183
<i>a little more finesse.</i>

11:08.673 --> 11:10.949
So then Mullen

11:11.026 --> 11:13.026
<i>picked the padlock.</i>

11:13.436 --> 11:14.513
<i>Right.</i>

11:14.590 --> 11:15.606
<i>And then they got in the grave.</i>

11:15.683 --> 11:17.105
<i>They're like, Okay.</i>

11:17.267 --> 11:19.169
<i>Let's, uh, try to lift it,</i>

11:19.246 --> 11:20.945
<i>and then
we just take the whole thing.</i>

11:22.646 --> 11:24.122
<i>And then they realized</i>

11:24.199 --> 11:26.488
<i>they're all too weak to
lift the sarcophagus.</i>

11:26.565 --> 11:27.978
<i>So they're like, Shit.</i>

11:28.055 --> 11:29.980
<i>We really...</i>

11:30.147 --> 11:31.683
<i>were unprepared.</i>

11:32.178 --> 11:33.508
<i>So Swegles is like, all right,</i>

11:33.585 --> 11:35.622
<i>you know what, boys? You know,
I'm just gonna go outside,</i>

11:35.699 --> 11:37.980
<i>smoke a cigarette,
and think about this.</i>

11:38.310 --> 11:40.590
Is somebody having sex next to us?

11:40.757 --> 11:42.273
Uh, it's definitely an animal.

11:42.350 --> 11:43.429
I don't think it's sex.

11:43.506 --> 11:45.761
- It's an animal?
- I think it's a coyote or a dog.

11:46.805 --> 11:48.892
That's a sexy-ass coyote.

11:48.969 --> 11:51.644
<i>So Swegles used this opportunity</i>

11:51.721 --> 11:53.781
<i>to signal Patrick Tyrrell</i>

11:53.858 --> 11:55.652
<i>and the Secret Service guys.</i>

11:56.136 --> 11:58.864
<i>So they all, like, tippy-toed in there.</i>

11:58.941 --> 12:00.812
<i>But then this guy, George Hay,</i>

12:00.889 --> 12:02.616
<i>was so stoked and nervous,</i>

12:02.693 --> 12:05.051
he fired his firearm on accident.

12:05.375 --> 12:06.536
<i>Whoops.</i>

12:06.613 --> 12:09.023
<i>And everybody freaked out.</i>

12:09.100 --> 12:10.833
<i>So Hughes and Mullen say,
ah, shit.</i>

12:10.910 --> 12:12.145
<i>We got to get out of here.</i>

12:12.222 --> 12:13.715
<i>And all the Secret Service agents</i>

12:13.792 --> 12:14.909
<i>start, like, firing in the dark.</i>

12:14.986 --> 12:16.275
<i>They're like, boom.</i>

12:16.352 --> 12:18.550
<i>Man, this is *** bullshit, dawg.</i>

12:18.627 --> 12:20.823
<i>So by the time they
got to the mausoleum,</i>

12:20.900 --> 12:23.094
<i>Mullen and Hughes
has gotten away.</i>

12:23.171 --> 12:24.764
So it was a huge mess and the...

12:24.841 --> 12:26.234
Secret Service guys are like,

12:26.311 --> 12:27.273
<i>Ah, shit.</i>

12:27.350 --> 12:29.069
<i>We really *** this one up.</i>

12:29.159 --> 12:30.490
<i>So Hughes and Mullen,</i>

12:30.567 --> 12:32.949
<i>they didn't know
it was the Secret Service.</i>

12:33.026 --> 12:34.269
<i>They just thought it was</i>

12:34.346 --> 12:37.063
<i>some random dudes'
shoot-out at a graveyard.</i>

12:37.140 --> 12:39.439
<i>So they just went back
to The Hub.</i>

12:39.516 --> 12:41.040
And they're just chilling.

12:41.117 --> 12:42.402
<i>And then the Secret Service</i>

12:42.479 --> 12:43.811
<i>*** bust into the bar</i>

12:43.888 --> 12:45.042
<i>and catch up with them.</i>

12:45.119 --> 12:46.652
So they're all patting

12:46.729 --> 12:47.574
each other's backs.

12:47.651 --> 12:48.988
<i>They're like, we finally got</i>

12:49.065 --> 12:50.464
<i>these *** assholes,</i>

12:50.541 --> 12:51.254
<i>you know.</i>

12:51.331 --> 12:53.175
<i>This is the establishment</i>

12:53.252 --> 12:54.866
<i>of the Secret Service.</i>

12:54.943 --> 12:56.613
<i>We're gonna protect presidents,</i>

12:56.690 --> 12:57.891
<i>dead or alive,</i>

12:57.968 --> 12:59.312
<i>for now...</i>

13:00.235 --> 13:01.934
<i>To eternity.</i>

13:05.041 --> 13:06.199
<i>So in the end,</i>

13:06.276 --> 13:08.148
to quote my grandfather...

13:12.581 --> 13:15.391
Up, up, down, down, B,
A, B, A, select, start.

13:15.468 --> 13:16.838
<i>Sí, señor.</i>

13:22.691 --> 13:24.346
Hello, I'm JD Ryznar.

13:24.423 --> 13:26.046
Today I'm going to tell you
the story

13:26.123 --> 13:27.371
of Elmer McCurdy,

13:27.448 --> 13:29.771
the bandit
who wouldn't give up.

13:35.904 --> 13:36.963
Boy...

13:37.040 --> 13:38.539
So where does our story begin?

13:38.616 --> 13:39.559
This is gonna be great.

13:39.636 --> 13:41.461
You guys,
you're gonna nail this, okay?

13:41.538 --> 13:42.637
I'm gonna go...

13:43.098 --> 13:44.286
And when I pull this back,

13:44.363 --> 13:45.431
it's gonna be the past.

13:45.508 --> 13:47.264
It's gonna be 1911.
Ready?

13:48.108 --> 13:49.176
Whoosh.

13:49.412 --> 13:53.145
<i>1911 in Pawhuska, Oklahoma.</i>

13:53.289 --> 13:54.569
<i>Elmer McCurdy</i>

13:54.646 --> 13:56.562
<i>wanted to be a
famous outlaw</i>

13:56.639 --> 13:59.210
<i>like Bill Doolin
of the Wild Bunch.</i>

13:59.287 --> 14:01.182
<i>He was like,
Ah, the Wild Bunch.</i>

14:01.259 --> 14:04.152
<i>They did so many cool
robberies in the 1800s,</i>

14:04.229 --> 14:08.226
<i>and they were the sweetest
outlaws you could think of.</i>

14:08.303 --> 14:10.006
<i>That's who I'm gonna be.</i>

14:10.239 --> 14:13.113
<i>Let's find
some crimes for me to do.</i>

14:13.190 --> 14:14.830
<i>So he decided</i>

14:14.907 --> 14:16.631
to rob trains.

14:16.746 --> 14:18.732
<i>So he robs everybody in the train</i>

14:18.809 --> 14:20.146
<i>and hides out.</i>

14:20.236 --> 14:22.140
<i>But then the police show up,</i>

14:22.217 --> 14:24.205
<i>and say, Hey, Elmer McCurdy,</i>

14:24.282 --> 14:26.803
<i>we see you, and we're gonna
have a shoot-out with you now.</i>

14:26.880 --> 14:28.554
<i>And he's like, All right.</i>

14:29.667 --> 14:31.265
<i>And the cops are like...</i>

14:32.498 --> 14:33.990
<i>And he's like...</i>

14:35.270 --> 14:37.154
<i>Elmer McCurdy gets shot in the chest.</i>

14:38.433 --> 14:39.814
<i>And as he's dying, he goes,</i>

14:39.891 --> 14:42.490
<i>Heh, heh, heh, heh, you just watch.</i>

14:42.567 --> 14:45.724
<i>I'm the bandit who will</i>

14:45.858 --> 14:48.842
<i>never give up.</i>

14:49.164 --> 14:50.285
<i>And he dies.</i>

14:50.362 --> 14:51.367
<i>Mm.</i>

14:51.444 --> 14:53.324
<i>And they just take
him to the funeral home.</i>

14:53.401 --> 14:55.887
<i>And Joseph Johnson,
the funeral director,</i>

14:55.964 --> 14:58.722
<i>was like, Got an outlaw here.</i>

14:58.832 --> 15:00.192
<i>It's 1911.</i>

15:00.269 --> 15:02.532
<i>People love outlaws.</i>

15:02.609 --> 15:05.209
<i>So I'm gonna embalm
this piece of shit.</i>

15:05.286 --> 15:07.621
<i>Okay, so Joseph Johnson
sets him up</i>

15:07.698 --> 15:09.449
<i>in the back of his funeral home.</i>

15:09.819 --> 15:11.192
<i>And he says to people,</i>

15:11.269 --> 15:12.925
<i>Hey, everybody,</i>

15:13.169 --> 15:15.226
<i>who wants to see a dead outlaw?</i>

15:15.303 --> 15:17.721
<i>You put a nickel in the
dead outlaw's mouth,</i>

15:17.798 --> 15:18.905
<i>you can look at him.</i>

15:18.982 --> 15:20.531
<i>So people just coming back</i>

15:20.608 --> 15:21.882
<i>to the back of his funeral home</i>

15:21.959 --> 15:23.589
<i>and going like, Whoa.</i>

15:23.666 --> 15:25.478
<i>It's a dead outlaw.</i>

15:25.555 --> 15:28.105
<i>I'm putting this nickel
right in his mouth.</i>

15:28.983 --> 15:30.847
<i>Best nickel I ever spent.</i>

15:32.662 --> 15:34.547
<i>The funeral director had
Elmer McCurdy</i>

15:34.624 --> 15:36.210
<i>in the back of his funeral parlor</i>

15:36.287 --> 15:37.327
<i>for five years,</i>

15:37.404 --> 15:39.722
<i>just making nickels hand over fist.</i>

15:39.799 --> 15:41.839
<i>I got so many nickels.</i>

15:41.916 --> 15:44.769
<i>I'm payin' all my bills.</i>

15:44.870 --> 15:46.215
<i>Nickels, nickels,</i>

15:46.292 --> 15:48.433
<i>I'm rich with nickels.</i>

15:52.193 --> 15:54.879
A man throwing that
many nickels around...

15:54.956 --> 15:57.646
can't go without drawing
too much attention

15:57.723 --> 15:59.339
from other greedy people.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.807
<i>And so this dude comes by</i>

16:01.884 --> 16:04.816
<i>and is like, oh, what's going on, bro?</i>

16:04.893 --> 16:06.657
<i>I'm Elm... I'm...</i>

16:06.734 --> 16:08.678
<i>Elmer McCurdy's brother.</i>

16:08.755 --> 16:10.637
<i>I kind of want to give
him a proper burial</i>

16:10.714 --> 16:11.724
<i>in uh, look,</i>

16:11.801 --> 16:13.566
<i>California or wherever...</i>

16:14.811 --> 16:16.893
<i>And the funeral director's like, well...</i>

16:16.970 --> 16:18.639
<i>Made a lot of nickels.
That was cool.</i>

16:18.716 --> 16:20.894
<i>I'm not gonna make many
arguments about that.</i>

16:20.990 --> 16:24.230
<i>So turns out the guy
who took Elmer McCurdy's body</i>

16:24.307 --> 16:27.362
was not Elmer McCurdy's
brother as he had claimed.

16:27.439 --> 16:28.603
It was actually

16:28.680 --> 16:30.364
<i>one of the Patterson brothers.</i>

16:30.441 --> 16:32.027
<i>And the Patterson brothers</i>

16:32.104 --> 16:33.746
<i>were taking this dead body</i>

16:33.823 --> 16:35.393
<i>across a country</i>

16:35.518 --> 16:37.011
<i>and were like, Hey, everybody,</i>

16:37.088 --> 16:38.173
<i>come and check it out.</i>

16:38.250 --> 16:40.191
<i>Hey, we got a cool wax figure</i>

16:40.268 --> 16:41.800
<i>of Jesse James</i>

16:41.877 --> 16:43.910
<i>and Bill Doolin from the Wild Bunch.</i>

16:43.987 --> 16:45.171
<i>That's a cool bunch.</i>

16:45.248 --> 16:47.447
<i>And then
we also have a real dead body</i>

16:47.524 --> 16:49.135
<i>of the bandit</i>

16:49.287 --> 16:50.630
<i>who wouldn't give up.</i>

16:50.707 --> 16:52.740
<i>And people were like,
Oh, a real dead body.</i>

16:52.817 --> 16:54.917
<i>I'll pay a nickel, 25¢.</i>

16:55.036 --> 16:56.803
<i>And the Patterson brothers
were like,</i>

16:56.880 --> 16:57.707
<i>Cha-ching.</i>

16:57.784 --> 16:59.997
<i>Money, money, money,
money, money, money, money.</i>

17:00.074 --> 17:01.294
<i>Quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter,</i>

17:01.371 --> 17:02.901
<i>quarter, quarter, quarter.</i>

17:03.368 --> 17:04.369
<i>But...</i>

17:04.446 --> 17:05.709
<i>after a while,</i>

17:05.786 --> 17:07.623
<i>the Patterson brothers
made their money</i>

17:07.700 --> 17:10.303
<i>and then it... it just kind
of wore out its welcome.</i>

17:10.380 --> 17:13.338
<i>So Patterson brothers
sell him to somebody else.</i>

17:13.416 --> 17:16.181
This dead body
is being passed around.

17:16.258 --> 17:17.349
<i>And people are like,
Listen.</i>

17:17.426 --> 17:18.420
<i>We can't do too much</i>

17:18.497 --> 17:19.883
<i>with this dead body anymore.</i>

17:19.960 --> 17:21.816
<i>We're gonna cover
him in a bunch of wax</i>

17:21.893 --> 17:23.553
<i>and we'll just put him in storage</i>

17:23.630 --> 17:25.166
<i>in Hollywood.</i>

17:33.120 --> 17:34.652
That was a great story.

17:34.729 --> 17:36.111
No, it's...

17:36.201 --> 17:38.390
the story's not over yet,
Derek Waters.

17:38.467 --> 17:40.388
I'm sorry.
The story gets cra...

17:40.465 --> 17:42.314
The story gets crazy.

17:45.607 --> 17:46.745
I'm gonna put a nickel

17:46.822 --> 17:47.746
in Derek Waters' mouth

17:47.823 --> 17:48.996
'cause that's what people did

17:49.073 --> 17:50.309
to Elmer McCurdy.

17:51.944 --> 17:53.636
It's funny. It's fun.

17:53.713 --> 17:55.211
That was fun to do.

17:55.288 --> 17:56.552
That was worth a nickel.

17:56.629 --> 17:58.015
Let me take that nickel
out of your mouth.

17:58.092 --> 17:59.898
That was more uncomfortable

17:59.975 --> 18:01.025
as you taking it out.

18:01.102 --> 18:02.546
I'm gonna put it
in your mouth again.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.758
What a delight!

18:03.835 --> 18:05.027
This is great.

18:05.557 --> 18:07.113
Where was I?

18:08.545 --> 18:11.504
Okay, so Elmer
McCurdy's body spent...

18:11.671 --> 18:13.572
20 years in storage.

18:13.649 --> 18:15.930
And then
there was this amusement park

18:16.007 --> 18:17.297
<i>in Long Beach, California,</i>

18:17.374 --> 18:19.754
<i>that was like,
we need a spooky thing</i>

18:19.831 --> 18:21.322
<i>for our spooky house.</i>

18:21.399 --> 18:23.731
<i>So they took this thing,
and they hung it up.</i>

18:23.808 --> 18:26.047
<i>And they painted it bright orange.</i>

18:28.197 --> 18:30.915
<i>So now it's 1976</i>

18:31.019 --> 18:34.262
<i>when a production of
"The Six Million Dollar Man"</i>

18:34.339 --> 18:35.865
<i>came to the funhouse.</i>

18:35.942 --> 18:37.473
<i>And they're like, It'd be cool</i>

18:37.550 --> 18:38.992
<i>if the Six Million Dollar Man</i>

18:39.069 --> 18:42.501
<i>came through the funhouse
and got spooked by a thing.</i>

18:42.578 --> 18:44.986
<i>But that mummy right there in the noose?</i>

18:45.063 --> 18:46.106
<i>That's not spooky.</i>

18:46.183 --> 18:47.816
<i>We need to get something
spookier than this.</i>

18:47.893 --> 18:48.723
<i>Let's strike that.</i>

18:48.800 --> 18:51.055
<i>That means "move it"
in making movies.</i>

18:51.687 --> 18:54.497
<i>So the moving-the-things guy</i>

18:54.574 --> 18:57.032
<i>goes and moves the thing,</i>

18:57.392 --> 18:59.415
<i>and the arm falls off.</i>

19:00.052 --> 19:01.275
<i>And the guy looks at the arm</i>

19:01.352 --> 19:02.692
<i>and was like,</i>

19:02.769 --> 19:04.887
<i>It's a... there's a bone!</i>

19:04.964 --> 19:06.859
<i>It's a real human hand.</i>

19:06.936 --> 19:08.529
<i>It's a bone in here.</i>

19:08.606 --> 19:10.758
<i>Ah, this is a real dead body.</i>

19:10.835 --> 19:12.244
<i>I'm scared of this.</i>

19:12.321 --> 19:13.564
<i>So...</i>

19:13.641 --> 19:15.562
<i>the ambulance comes, and...</i>

19:15.639 --> 19:17.369
<i>the coroner takes a look at it,</i>

19:17.446 --> 19:19.410
<i>examines it very closely,</i>

19:19.487 --> 19:20.805
<i>and was like,</i>

19:20.882 --> 19:24.127
<i>Wait, there's a bunch of
nickels in this guy's mouth.</i>

19:24.204 --> 19:27.669
<i>He has a bunch of
carnival sideshow stubs</i>

19:27.746 --> 19:29.081
<i>shoved into his coat.</i>

19:29.158 --> 19:31.014
<i>We got a bullet wound in his chest.</i>

19:31.091 --> 19:33.479
<i>We've got some certain
scars on this and that.</i>

19:33.556 --> 19:36.481
<i>Oh, this is shitty Elmer McCurdy,</i>

19:36.558 --> 19:39.438
<i>the outlaw who wanted
to be a cooler outlaw.</i>

19:39.601 --> 19:41.547
<i>Oh, well, that's who it is.</i>

19:41.637 --> 19:44.829
So once they found out
it was a real dude...

19:45.211 --> 19:47.360
<i>they shipped him back to Oklahoma,</i>

19:47.476 --> 19:49.562
<i>and they had a big funeral for him.</i>

19:49.639 --> 19:51.422
<i>300 people showed up.</i>

19:51.750 --> 19:54.286
<i>And they buried him right
next to Bill Doolin,</i>

19:54.363 --> 19:56.944
<i>and he looks at Bill
Doolin's grave and he's like,</i>

19:57.021 --> 19:58.815
<i>I'm a big fan of yours.</i>

19:58.892 --> 20:01.057
<i>And then Bill Doolin's ghost says,</i>

20:01.134 --> 20:04.247
<i>You're just a ghost
talking to a grave, dude.</i>

20:04.324 --> 20:06.080
<i>Uh, you're a shitty outlaw.</i>

20:06.157 --> 20:07.326
<i>Eat a dick.</i>

20:07.403 --> 20:09.465
But Elmer McCurdy was the bandit

20:09.542 --> 20:10.824
who wouldn't give up,

20:10.901 --> 20:13.562
until he had a reputation
as a sweet bandit,

20:13.639 --> 20:15.277
and that's what he got.

20:15.811 --> 20:18.162
<i>Not bad, Elmer McCurdy...</i>

20:19.568 --> 20:21.227
<i>Not bad.</i>

20:21.717 --> 20:25.376
That's... that makes
me have hope for America

20:25.480 --> 20:28.266
that, like, you could
really make it here...

20:28.621 --> 20:31.461
as a dead body for 60 years.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.078
Who you winking at?

20:36.161 --> 20:38.516
Amer... I was winking at America.
