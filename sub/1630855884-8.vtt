[Verna] 84,000 people just last year.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.291
Just in the U.S.

00:24.833 --> 00:28.208
And that's just a guess.
It's impossible to know the real numbers.

00:29.416 --> 00:34.958

But we know better, don't we?

00:45.375 --> 00:47.541
Millions, Roderick.

00:47.541 --> 00:48.958
Millions.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.625
And that's just the deaths.

00:55.416 --> 00:56.333

Roderick Usher.

01:05.041 --> 01:06.375
It's really you.

01:07.291 --> 01:09.500
I'm sorry I couldn't accept
your resignation.

01:10.333 --> 01:14.541
I tried to explain that to your sister
that she wasn't going to change the math.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.333
And she had it in her head that--

01:17.333 --> 01:20.416
If I die, this stops?

01:21.291 --> 01:22.625
Which is bad faith.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.250
Isn't it?

01:24.750 --> 01:26.583
She tried to loophole me.

01:27.708 --> 01:29.208
Name your price.

01:29.208 --> 01:30.333
Oh, sweetie.

01:31.250 --> 01:32.583
You are funny.

01:33.875 --> 01:34.875
[chuckles softly]

01:35.375 --> 01:37.166

03:02.458 --> 03:06.041
They shouldn't have talked to you
without me here, and they know better.

03:06.041 --> 03:09.458
- Now you can give your real statement.
- My statement was the truth.

03:14.375 --> 03:18.833
The truth is, your father died
in a horrible accident

03:18.833 --> 03:21.041
but it's important he died upstanding.

03:21.750 --> 03:23.916
He brought your mother home
to care for her.

03:24.625 --> 03:27.041
Who knows what she might have
done to herself in her state.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.041
He mutilated her.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.583
Did he?

03:30.208 --> 03:31.375
Did you see that occur?

03:32.166 --> 03:35.291
Look, I don't expect you
to understand this,

03:35.291 --> 03:37.458
but your father was the swing vote
on the board.

03:37.458 --> 03:42.166
With him gone, the empire is balanced
on the head of a pin.

03:42.166 --> 03:44.666
He abused and mutilated my mother.

03:44.666 --> 03:47.708
And then went off on drugs,
I think, and got himself killed.

03:49.625 --> 03:54.041
Well, your mother,
as much as she's been through,

03:54.708 --> 03:56.708
she understands this family pretty well.

03:56.708 --> 04:02.166
And I promise you, after I talk to her,
she'll do what's right for the company.

04:03.833 --> 04:05.250
Then you won't talk to her.

04:06.166 --> 04:08.916
I don't care what's good for the family.
Or the company.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.750
This is about my mom.

04:11.875 --> 04:14.708
And if you think you're coming near her
with more pliers,

04:14.708 --> 04:17.291
over my dead body, you fucking ghoul.

04:20.833 --> 04:22.916
I'd like to make another statement.

04:22.916 --> 04:24.750
[Roderick] <i>Well, I mean,

04:27.083 --> 04:28.208

You know where she gets that from, right?

04:38.583 --> 04:39.750
Well, this is awkward.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.375
Did you tell him yet?

04:46.250 --> 04:47.375
Not yet.

04:47.375 --> 04:48.750
Tell me what?

04:50.458 --> 04:53.416
With Freddie gone, the board want a...
There's no easy way--

04:53.416 --> 04:54.583
I'm out.

04:55.166 --> 04:58.875
And Freddie gone, they need someone
to step in fast...

04:58.875 --> 05:00.250
- It's me.
- I bet.

05:00.250 --> 05:03.083

05:07.416 --> 05:10.208
The board's the board.
I don't control them more than you.

05:10.208 --> 05:13.125
They wouldn't dare. Not if they didn't
already have it cracked.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.541
You brokered this, Arthur?

05:14.541 --> 05:17.958
Made your move when?
After Vic? Just good math?

05:17.958 --> 05:19.166
[Madeline] This wasn't that.

05:20.041 --> 05:23.708
- It was equal parts math and mercy.
- [scoffs]

05:23.708 --> 05:26.416
But like you said, my math was good.

05:26.416 --> 05:28.041
[Roderick] Doesn't matter, Madeline.

05:30.291 --> 05:31.750
She wouldn't let me die.

05:36.708 --> 05:38.333
That's what did it in, you know.

05:38.875 --> 05:42.166
My boss said, we'd already won
once you were on the plate.

05:42.166 --> 05:44.791
"No point in pushing the case.
The dragon was slain."

05:44.791 --> 05:46.333
I told him he was wrong.

05:47.958 --> 05:53.291
He says, Roderick Usher lost his children,
and his company too.

05:53.291 --> 05:54.416
What else do you want?

05:54.416 --> 05:55.583
What else did you want?

05:55.583 --> 05:56.500
Justice.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.250
What does that look like?

05:59.125 --> 06:00.208
For what you've done?

06:01.166 --> 06:02.166
I don't know.

06:04.666 --> 06:06.500
Suppose I'll know it when I see it.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.125
- She is the best of us.

You speak so highly of her,
but you won't answer her texts.

06:28.166 --> 06:30.666
Of all of my children,
I'm most like Tamerlane.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.291
Outsourcing intimacy.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.291
Lenore always had that.

06:38.500 --> 06:45.000
And then it skipped Freddie and Tammy.
I don't... I don't know, maybe I...

06:48.791 --> 06:50.000
I choked it out of them.

06:51.625 --> 06:55.625
Annabel, she had custody and...

06:57.791 --> 06:59.208
I couldn't stand that,

06:59.208 --> 07:03.291
so I waited until they were old enough
and I just bombed them with money.

07:04.291 --> 07:08.416
Just flashed a whole life in front of them
and they picked me. Of course, they did.

07:08.875 --> 07:12.333
And when they showed up, at my door,

07:12.333 --> 07:16.083
and I looked at them and I saw myself.

07:17.291 --> 07:20.250
But whatever of their mother
had been in there...

07:23.500 --> 07:24.583
it was gone.

07:26.583 --> 07:27.958
It was killed by the money.

07:32.125 --> 07:36.583
And Annabel,
just couldn't live without them.

07:41.708 --> 07:43.958
But Lenore always had her in there.

07:44.750 --> 07:45.875
My fire, but...

07:48.375 --> 07:49.625
her grandmother's heart.

07:51.666 --> 07:53.083
Her grandmother's compass.

07:56.791 --> 07:58.250
Lenore always had that.

08:02.541 --> 08:03.666
I saw her today.

08:05.375 --> 08:06.208
Who?

08:08.000 --> 08:08.833

08:18.250 --> 08:20.958

08:23.041 --> 08:25.125

08:40.750 --> 08:44.000
<i>From the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee</i>

09:00.208 --> 09:01.458
How are you here?

09:07.291 --> 09:08.375
"He's rich."

09:11.125 --> 09:12.958
When people asked how you took them,

09:15.083 --> 09:17.166
how you convinced them away from me.

09:18.625 --> 09:21.291
"He's rich," I'd say. "He's rich."

09:22.250 --> 09:24.500
And you don't understand
what that word means.

09:27.541 --> 09:28.583
They were young.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.291
They only knew appetite,

09:32.291 --> 09:37.208
and "Here," you said, "come with me.
Gorge yourselves."

09:38.041 --> 09:39.791
How could I compete with that?

09:40.500 --> 09:42.750
You didn't feed them though, did you?

09:44.208 --> 09:45.916
You starved them.

09:47.250 --> 09:51.375
Less and less of them came back each time
until one day they were empty.

09:51.375 --> 09:52.833
They were syphoned.

09:54.416 --> 09:56.333
You started filling them up with...

09:59.291 --> 10:01.375
What did you fill them up with, Roderick?

10:03.125 --> 10:04.958
What did you have to fill them with?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.208
Because you weren't rich, were you?

10:12.625 --> 10:15.291
I thought you were a rich man
all this time, but I...

10:16.833 --> 10:17.916

The poverty of you.

10:37.125 --> 10:39.750
Maybe this is a kindness in disguise.

11:03.916 --> 11:05.458

- Auggie--
- He was doing the right thing.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.125
He's going to get fired, Roderick.

11:09.125 --> 11:12.708
Yeah, well, he made his own bed
and he was an idiot, to be honest.

11:12.708 --> 11:14.625
- Naive.
- What does that make me?

You know, I may have already said that.

15:41.416 --> 15:43.416
And that's... that's not even a lie.

15:43.416 --> 15:46.500
I mean, not anymore,
because you're my guy.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.916
I mean, listen, I had them change
the blueprints in the new building.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.541
They're building an office
next to mine. It's yours, okay?

15:52.541 --> 15:57.875
Everywhere I go, you are going.
You are a made man. You understand me?

15:57.875 --> 16:00.833
There is nobody on the face
of this fucking planet

16:00.833 --> 16:02.458
that I trust more than you.

16:02.458 --> 16:07.625
And there is not a single person,
friend or foe, who does not know that.

16:07.625 --> 16:08.916
Okay?

16:08.916 --> 16:10.833
- Let's have another drink.
- Way ahead of you.

16:11.750 --> 16:13.541
You're a sherry man, aren't you?

16:13.541 --> 16:15.583
Holy shit. What is it?

16:15.583 --> 16:16.916
Amontillado. Whoa!

16:16.916 --> 16:20.125
A powerful wine for a powerful man.

16:21.458 --> 16:22.333
Damn right.

16:23.041 --> 16:26.416
This bottle right here, this probably cost
more than a year of your s--

16:26.416 --> 16:28.708
Well, your former salary.

16:28.708 --> 16:32.666
Because after tomorrow, you can afford
to take a bath in this stuff.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.541
[Madeline] To Fortunato.

16:35.541 --> 16:36.750
[Rufus] Hear, fucking hear!

16:37.500 --> 16:38.500
To Fortunato.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.500
Mmm. Mmm!

16:44.791 --> 16:47.416
That's good. Hey, no, don't be shy,
bottoms up, let's go.

16:47.416 --> 16:48.458
I'm going to savor it.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.791
Actually, I gotta hit the head
real quick.

16:50.791 --> 16:52.208
Yeah, go, do your thing.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.833
Hey, well done, man. Fucking hero.

16:58.958 --> 16:59.875
Thanks.

17:00.833 --> 17:04.083
<i>♪ Do I make you feel so good ♪</i>

17:05.083 --> 17:07.583
<i>♪ Baby ♪</i>

17:08.250 --> 17:11.708
<i>♪ Am I being understood... ♪</i>

17:25.875 --> 17:28.791
- Ooh. Good choice.
- Mmm. Yeah?

17:28.791 --> 17:30.625
Nobody's going to wander down here.

17:31.208 --> 17:32.791
You know what this is, right?

17:33.916 --> 17:38.750
This... is going to be the foundation
of my new building.

17:39.750 --> 17:42.375
Which is going to be 70 stories tall...

17:44.875 --> 17:46.500
- Wow.
- You know what else?

17:51.666 --> 17:54.000
We can make all the noise we want.

17:56.166 --> 17:57.166
You promise?

17:57.833 --> 17:58.666
Uh-huh.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.333
[chuckles]

18:02.333 --> 18:03.416
Oh, okay.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.750
- Patience, baby.
- Yeah?

18:07.833 --> 18:08.708
[chuckles]

18:08.708 --> 18:10.208
I got to be honest with you.

18:10.208 --> 18:12.458
I thought you were a cold fish
when I met you.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.166
But I like you better this way.

18:14.166 --> 18:15.541
- Mmm.
- Ah!

18:17.750 --> 18:18.958
Stay.

18:23.416 --> 18:24.666
[exhales]

18:28.083 --> 18:31.125
If you can get over here,
you can do what you want to me.

18:31.125 --> 18:32.250
[chuckles]

18:34.291 --> 18:35.791
Accept that challenge.

18:36.583 --> 18:37.416
Hey.

18:37.416 --> 18:38.666
[exhales]

18:38.666 --> 18:40.500
Anything you want, stud.

18:41.208 --> 18:42.375
Whoa. [sighs]

18:44.833 --> 18:45.875
[groans]

18:47.208 --> 18:48.583
[sighs] What the fuck?

18:48.583 --> 18:53.875
You big, strong, powerful man.

18:56.625 --> 18:58.000
[thuds]

19:04.208 --> 19:05.791
[Rufus groans softly]

19:16.000 --> 19:16.916
What is this?

19:18.333 --> 19:19.958
[Madeline] Look, Roddie, he's awake.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.583
Did you drug me?

19:21.583 --> 19:23.583
I like how you pretended
to be impressed,

19:23.583 --> 19:26.416
like you can tell the difference
between sherry and amontillado.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.333
Whoa, what the fuck is this?

19:30.875 --> 19:32.208
It's a hostile takeover.

19:32.916 --> 19:34.083
[laughs]

19:37.041 --> 19:38.583
Seriously, what is this?

19:39.083 --> 19:41.041
I thought we would see
all the stages,

19:41.041 --> 19:42.666
but we may never get out of denial.

19:42.666 --> 19:44.666
We'll finish this wall
and still be hearing,

19:44.666 --> 19:46.291
"Seriously, what is this?"

19:46.833 --> 19:49.958
Hey! [screams]

19:49.958 --> 19:50.958
There we go.

19:50.958 --> 19:52.916
You let me out of here right fucking now!

19:52.916 --> 19:54.708
I will fucking kill you!

19:54.708 --> 19:55.875
Definitely not, then.

19:55.875 --> 19:59.458
And actually, I think that makes this
self-defense. So, thanks for that.

19:59.458 --> 20:01.333
You fucking fucks.

20:01.333 --> 20:06.583
I will dismember you and fuck each piece.
Do you hear me?

20:06.583 --> 20:08.583
Anger is going great.

20:08.583 --> 20:14.083
[screaming] Help! Somebody he...

20:14.083 --> 20:16.583
[laughs raucously] Okay. Okay.

20:17.541 --> 20:20.083
[continues laughing] Okay.

20:20.083 --> 20:21.875
You fucking got me.

20:22.916 --> 20:27.958
You got me. You two, holy shit.
You got me.

20:27.958 --> 20:29.708
You're real ballers, aren't you?

20:30.250 --> 20:31.416
Oh, thank you.

20:31.416 --> 20:33.000
Listen, I'm impressed.

20:33.625 --> 20:36.375
I can be the magic man.
I can change things for you.

20:36.375 --> 20:38.333
Here's the thing, Rufus.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.416
Roderick threw himself
in front of the Feds,

20:40.416 --> 20:42.666
took the bullet, got everyone clear,

20:42.666 --> 20:45.958
but that doesn't mean
that the Feds weren't right.

20:45.958 --> 20:48.541
Falsifying data, forging signatures,
fraudulent studies

20:48.541 --> 20:51.541
and, well, grave robbing.

20:51.541 --> 20:55.666
Corpses disappearing
after participating in Fortunato trials.

20:55.666 --> 20:59.500
I imagine because the chemicals
in their bodies would be incriminating.

20:59.500 --> 21:02.166
You stopped all that. You fixed that.

21:02.166 --> 21:03.791
[Madeline] Yeah, only so far.

21:03.791 --> 21:05.916
We go to the board and say
we dodged a bullet,

21:05.916 --> 21:07.250
but the cancer runs deep,

21:07.250 --> 21:10.250
and the man behind it all,
the man responsible,

21:10.250 --> 21:12.666
well, he has got to go, doesn't he?

21:13.458 --> 21:14.625
For the good of the company.

21:14.625 --> 21:17.041
You want me to what? Resign?

21:18.833 --> 21:19.833
Confess?

21:21.750 --> 21:23.083
What do you want me to do?

21:23.833 --> 21:24.791
Nothing.

21:27.083 --> 21:29.500
[sighs in exasperation]

21:29.500 --> 21:30.875
All right. Listen to me.

21:30.875 --> 21:35.500
Okay. I... Okay.
[breathing heavily] I get it.

21:35.500 --> 21:38.416
I never should have made Roderick
take the fall for this.

21:38.416 --> 21:40.416
Right? That's what this is, isn't it?

21:41.041 --> 21:43.250
And... And you're right, that was fucked!

21:43.250 --> 21:46.166
But I didn't know! Did I?
I didn't know who I was dealing with.

21:46.166 --> 21:48.583
I picked the wrong patsy.

21:48.583 --> 21:50.208
Okay? But that's over now.

21:50.208 --> 21:53.375
That's behind us. And now I know, okay?
I misjudged you.

21:54.791 --> 21:57.125
Fuck, listen to me,
I can get you things.

21:57.125 --> 22:02.500
I can get whatever you want.
Uh... stock options, promotion.

22:03.708 --> 22:06.791
Madeline, you should come work for us.
How does VP sound?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.666
I was thinking COO.

22:09.666 --> 22:12.291
Yes, fuck, yeah, okay. Why not?

22:12.291 --> 22:15.000
I mean, that'll be,
you know, take a minute,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.458
but that's a great goal. Long term, right?

22:19.041 --> 22:20.375
Stop.

22:20.958 --> 22:24.208
Stop! Stop! Stop! Okay...

22:27.166 --> 22:28.000
Three million.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.833
Dollars. Fucking each.

22:33.666 --> 22:34.500
To start!

22:35.083 --> 22:37.791
The board will be disturbed
when they learn what you've done.

22:37.791 --> 22:40.250
And that you disappeared, you ran off.

22:40.833 --> 22:43.208
To a beach somewhere without extradition.

22:43.208 --> 22:46.750
The company's in a tailspin,
can't promote the existing brass,

22:46.750 --> 22:48.500
they're all tainted goods.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.791
All named in the file too.

22:49.791 --> 22:52.083
Plus, no one wants to put their head
in that noose.

22:52.083 --> 22:54.458
Not if the Feds decide
to tighten it again.

22:54.458 --> 23:00.791
Unless, what if... there was a candidate
who already escaped the hangman once.

23:00.791 --> 23:02.958
Maybe someone the board's
heard a lot about.

23:02.958 --> 23:07.291
Someone even Rufus Griswold admitted
was a cut above,

23:07.291 --> 23:09.541
bulletproof, trustworthy beyond a fault.

23:09.541 --> 23:14.833
And given my celebrity status right now,
I'll be on the fast track.

23:14.833 --> 23:18.500
Especially after you talked him up
so damn much.

23:19.833 --> 23:20.666
And now...

23:21.708 --> 23:24.666
Like you said, you can make
all the noise you want.

23:24.666 --> 23:29.708
And no one's due back at work for a week,
so happy new year.

23:31.750 --> 23:34.166
Oh... wait.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.416
That candle will last you
an hour or so,

23:47.416 --> 23:49.708
then, I'm afraid, you're in the dark,

24:26.916 --> 24:28.916
[metallic clinking]

24:32.708 --> 24:34.541
You sure no one will come down here?

24:35.458 --> 24:36.750
No, not tonight.

24:36.750 --> 24:39.708
And he won't make it past morning,
not with the cyanide.

24:39.708 --> 24:42.208
I really can't believe he didn't taste it.

24:42.208 --> 24:46.750
He really... didn't know shit about sherry.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.083
Back upstairs for a bit?

24:49.666 --> 24:51.250
- Be seen some.
- Mmm.

24:53.666 --> 24:57.791
Thought so, but no. Too clean.
Better that they all saw us leave.

24:58.333 --> 25:02.375
If the cops ask, I fucked him in his car,

25:02.375 --> 25:07.291
he took off looking for some blow,
and you and I hit a second venue.

25:09.750 --> 25:12.125
Our job tonight is to be seen,
but not scrutinized.

25:12.125 --> 25:13.208
Do you get it?

25:14.666 --> 25:15.666
Smaller venue.

25:16.416 --> 25:18.000
Neighborhood bar.

25:19.250 --> 25:20.416
Something like that.

25:23.583 --> 25:25.375
Kind of thought he'd be louder.

25:26.458 --> 25:27.541
I know.

25:29.583 --> 25:31.208
["Another Brick in the Wall" playing]

25:31.208 --> 25:33.083
[Roderick] So where do we go now?

25:34.958 --> 25:38.708
[Madeline] She's wearing
a fur coat inside, dripping diamonds,

25:38.708 --> 25:41.458
and going on and on
about her house on the Cape.

25:41.458 --> 25:47.500
And then I look over at her meal ticket,
I'm sorry, her betrothed,

25:47.500 --> 25:50.791
and he is this bloated monster of a human,

25:50.791 --> 25:54.250
just stuffing his maw
with the company caviar,

25:54.250 --> 25:58.333
and I thought to myself,
if that is who I'd have to serve, to fuck,

25:58.333 --> 26:01.250
for diamonds and furs
and a house on the Cape, forget it.

26:02.041 --> 26:03.250
[Verna] So there is a limit.

26:03.250 --> 26:05.291
No, it's not a limit, it's a standard.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.291
I don't want it, any of it,

26:08.291 --> 26:11.000
if it involves serving
at some man's pleasure.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.166
What about a woman's?

26:12.166 --> 26:13.291
[Roderick] Hey.

26:14.041 --> 26:15.541
I thought we had a moment.

26:15.541 --> 26:16.958
I'm nothing if not versatile.

26:17.791 --> 26:19.625
What's your dealbreaker, handsome?

26:20.208 --> 26:21.916
[Roderick] Don't think I have one.

26:22.833 --> 26:24.500
Curiouser and curiouser.

26:25.583 --> 26:29.791
I find most people have
a threshold qualifier.

26:30.416 --> 26:33.666
Something or someone
they'd be unwilling to sacrifice,

26:33.666 --> 26:35.250
no matter how sweet the deal.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.291
Don't think I'm like most people.

26:37.291 --> 26:39.750
So what would you do
to make your dreams come true?

26:41.000 --> 26:44.500
People talk a good game,
but money where your mouth is.

26:45.166 --> 26:46.500
What would you be willing to do?

26:46.500 --> 26:49.208
For example, what if I told you right now

26:49.208 --> 26:53.000
that you could achieve
all the success you ever imagined?

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
All the money.

26:54.583 --> 26:59.166
All the power. A lifetime of luxury.
Comfort. What would you do?

27:00.333 --> 27:01.375
What would you give?

27:03.708 --> 27:07.375
Our mother used to tell us Bible stories.

27:08.625 --> 27:12.333
She talked about how the meek
would inherit the Earth.

27:12.333 --> 27:14.375
Well, she didn't inherit shit.

27:15.250 --> 27:19.083
So all these hypotheticals,
"Never Have I Ever," "Fuck Marry Kill,"

27:19.083 --> 27:21.208
"What Would You Do for a Klondike Bar?"

27:21.208 --> 27:23.208
"Devil at the Crossroads."

27:24.125 --> 27:25.416
It's all just fairytales.

27:26.333 --> 27:30.125
Magic beans and beanstalks,
bedtime stories for kids.

27:30.625 --> 27:36.291
The real world is Darwinian.
Survival, chaos, power.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Leverage.

27:42.375 --> 27:44.291
You're a killer, aren't you?

27:45.125 --> 27:46.375
Both of you.

27:46.375 --> 27:47.833
Couple of real killers.

27:48.541 --> 27:49.541
I wouldn't say that.

27:50.333 --> 27:53.083
Really? What else would you call it?

27:53.583 --> 27:56.541
I mean, you killed Rufus Griswold tonight,
didn't you?

27:58.833 --> 28:01.666
And you're here, building an alibi.

28:02.250 --> 28:05.708
This bartender would say
you were here all night.

28:07.625 --> 28:09.250
Closed the place and then some.

28:10.750 --> 28:15.666
What if I said I could guarantee
that you'll get away with it?

28:16.916 --> 28:17.875
And not just that.

28:18.625 --> 28:19.458
All of it.

28:20.500 --> 28:26.125
In good time, not a lot of time,
you'll be elected CEO, Roderick.

28:26.125 --> 28:28.125
Or Madeline, if you prefer.

28:29.333 --> 28:32.666
You will be the king and queen
of Fortunato. Your birthright.

28:33.833 --> 28:36.666
CEO, COO, whatever you want.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.583
And I'll sweeten the deal.

28:40.625 --> 28:43.666
No legal consequences. Guaranteed.

28:44.791 --> 28:45.958
For your whole life.

28:45.958 --> 28:51.416
People may try but you will never,
ever get convicted of a single crime.

28:52.625 --> 28:54.958
The company is yours
to do with what you want.

28:55.958 --> 28:58.041
Be altruistic, be charitable, or don't.

28:58.875 --> 29:00.458
I just want to see what you do.

29:00.958 --> 29:02.541
The fuck are you talking about?

29:02.541 --> 29:04.000
[Verna] You feel it.

29:04.583 --> 29:05.583
Both of you.

29:06.250 --> 29:07.416
In the air.

29:09.416 --> 29:11.625
We're sitting outside of time and space.

29:13.833 --> 29:18.666
This is the moment luck meets opportunity.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.833
That's a hell of an offer.

29:29.458 --> 29:32.958
And you're going to say it costs what?
Our... souls or whatever?

29:32.958 --> 29:34.416
[Verna chuckles]

29:34.416 --> 29:38.500
No such thing, for one,
and even if there was,

29:38.500 --> 29:41.083
you already sold them tonight,
one brick at a time.

29:41.083 --> 29:44.125
[chuckles] No, nothing so silly as that.

29:45.291 --> 29:46.875
It won't even go on your tab.

29:48.625 --> 29:52.125
What if I said you get all that,
the whole thing,

29:53.625 --> 29:54.958
and the price is deferred?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.916
Let the next generation foot the bill.

29:59.958 --> 30:00.916
So that's the deal.

30:01.750 --> 30:03.583
You get the whole world,

30:03.583 --> 30:06.500
and when you're done,
at the end of it all,

30:06.500 --> 30:09.083
just before you would have died, Roderick,

30:09.083 --> 30:11.291
just before you would have died anyway...

30:12.791 --> 30:14.583
your bloodline dies with you.

30:30.500 --> 30:35.541
Well, just hypothetically...

30:37.041 --> 30:38.750
how long would he live?

30:39.583 --> 30:40.833
[Verna] He?

30:40.833 --> 30:42.166
Not we?

30:42.166 --> 30:44.500
No dear, you two die together.

30:45.416 --> 30:48.416
You came into this world together,
and you go out of it together.

30:48.416 --> 30:49.500
Or no deal.

30:50.125 --> 30:51.791
I'm a creature of symmetry.

30:53.541 --> 30:54.833
You'd live a long time.

30:55.375 --> 30:58.375
Longer than any man
in the Usher family ever has.

30:59.041 --> 31:03.458
But when that curtain falls,
everyone takes a bow together.

31:08.416 --> 31:09.458
I mean...

31:11.875 --> 31:17.041
Those kids... would have quite the life.

31:18.250 --> 31:20.583
[Verna] They'd never want for anything.

31:20.583 --> 31:25.458
They could live decades
with every luxury, every opportunity.

31:26.041 --> 31:30.791
Or they could live
a little longer, but struggle.

31:32.291 --> 31:38.375
What's more loving?
Forty years, 50 years of a gilded life?

31:38.375 --> 31:43.125
Or 70, 80 years of anxiety,

31:43.125 --> 31:46.041
tribulation, and heartache?

31:48.000 --> 31:54.125
Every Usher that exists today,
and every Usher yet to be born,

31:54.875 --> 32:00.916
they will live a blessed, privileged life
and depart the stage together.

32:01.958 --> 32:02.833
Mmm.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.333
Hypothetically?

32:07.166 --> 32:08.125
No.

32:08.625 --> 32:09.625
Real deal.

32:10.333 --> 32:11.625
It's an offer.

32:11.625 --> 32:12.708
On the table.

32:13.666 --> 32:14.708
What do you say?

32:18.833 --> 32:19.916
I'd say that's a good deal.

32:19.916 --> 32:21.458
I'd say that's a done deal.

32:21.458 --> 32:22.625
[Verna] Then say it.

32:27.916 --> 32:29.333
You have a deal.

32:30.416 --> 32:31.916
[Verna] You too, Cleopatra.

32:32.541 --> 32:33.541
I...

32:35.541 --> 32:38.291
I don't even have kids, this is his thing.

32:38.291 --> 32:39.416
[Verna] You too.

32:48.333 --> 32:49.333
You have a deal.

32:53.500 --> 32:57.708
[Verna] In the ancient world,
we'd seal this with blood, or spit.

32:58.750 --> 33:00.541
And then later, papyrus.

33:01.083 --> 33:06.375
But, a deal's a deal all over the world.

33:07.291 --> 33:09.041
Tonight, we'll just drink.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.041
But not just any drink.

33:14.875 --> 33:19.583
Henri IV Dudognon Heritage Cognac.

33:22.708 --> 33:25.041
Aged 100 years in barrels.

33:25.666 --> 33:28.166
Named in honor of the beloved French king.

33:30.625 --> 33:31.791
Pricey stuff.

33:33.750 --> 33:36.083
You drink this
on the best day of your life.

33:37.041 --> 33:38.583
Or your last night on Earth.

33:41.666 --> 33:44.666
This moment calls for it.

33:47.791 --> 33:49.333
To the House of Usher.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.208
Whose time has come.

34:01.416 --> 34:02.500
Hmm.

34:11.458 --> 34:12.541
Hmm.

34:17.500 --> 34:18.666
You'd better get going.

34:19.708 --> 34:20.750
Get some sleep.

34:21.791 --> 34:23.541
Lots to do, you two.

34:23.541 --> 34:24.625
Lots to do.

34:28.625 --> 34:30.041
We should settle up.

34:33.708 --> 34:34.708
We just did.

34:58.708 --> 35:00.833
Well, that was loopy.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.625
Weird fucking lady.

35:05.666 --> 35:07.125
Do you think she meant what...

35:31.916 --> 35:33.958
[Roderick] <i>It faded like a dream.</i>

35:34.958 --> 35:37.458
And by the time we got home,
it didn't feel real.

35:39.166 --> 35:40.000
At all.

35:42.666 --> 35:46.833
And a day or two later, we were so worried
about someone finding Gris,

35:46.833 --> 35:52.375
we... both kind of blew it off.

35:53.791 --> 35:56.583
We were drunk. Maybe we were stoned.

35:57.875 --> 35:59.500
We remembered it differently.

36:00.708 --> 36:02.041
It was a <i>folie à deux.</i>

36:04.208 --> 36:06.041
A delusion shared by two.

36:08.625 --> 36:10.666
And then we never talked about it again.

36:12.333 --> 36:14.583
They never found Gris.
The cops never came.

36:14.583 --> 36:16.041
The board voted me in.

36:17.166 --> 36:18.458
And the work began.

36:19.750 --> 36:23.000
Ligodone began.

36:24.541 --> 36:26.958
And over the years,
it was just a weird dream.

36:30.250 --> 36:31.250
Nothing more.

36:34.875 --> 36:36.500
Pym was looking for this woman.

36:37.458 --> 36:39.208
- You said he found her.
- [Roderick] Yeah.

36:39.208 --> 36:40.333
Where was she?

36:42.583 --> 36:44.791
Same place she'd been
the whole fucking time.

37:00.250 --> 37:01.333
[door closes]

37:03.833 --> 37:05.625
[grunts]

37:06.708 --> 37:08.208
[breathing heavily]

37:10.541 --> 37:12.541
[breath trembling]

37:21.083 --> 37:23.083
[gasping]

37:51.125 --> 37:54.125
[tape ripping]

38:13.750 --> 38:14.750
[inhales]

38:21.166 --> 38:23.166
[line ringing]

38:27.750 --> 38:28.958
Ready for pickup.

38:29.500 --> 38:30.583
I'm leaving now.

38:31.625 --> 38:32.833
[Verna laughs]

38:34.291 --> 38:36.833
Wow, that was amazing.

38:37.666 --> 38:39.833
I'm sorry, I just... I couldn't help myself.

38:39.833 --> 38:43.750
You had your little guy parked out there
for two days and I thought, fuck it.

38:45.500 --> 38:47.583
I had the best seat in the house.

38:49.833 --> 38:51.500
Your reputation is warranted.

38:56.291 --> 38:58.041
You're beautiful at what you do.

38:59.708 --> 39:00.708
Can I get you a drink?

39:07.208 --> 39:08.041
Please, sit.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.708
I've been looking forward to this.

39:14.625 --> 39:16.708
So your guy, once he picked me up,

39:16.708 --> 39:19.458
he was gonna cut off
my hands and my head,

39:19.458 --> 39:24.000
and then the body goes into an oil drum
and gets dropped a hundred miles out.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.250
That still the dance?

39:28.500 --> 39:29.708
I apologize.

39:30.625 --> 39:32.083
It's nothing personal.

39:32.083 --> 39:33.333
Oh, I know, Arthur.

39:34.708 --> 39:36.083
And I kind of set you up.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.750
So, I apologize as well.

39:40.125 --> 39:41.583
You really don't remember me?

39:43.125 --> 39:45.250
I was so impressed with you lot.

39:45.916 --> 39:48.000
The Transglobe Expedition.

39:48.833 --> 39:52.208
Circumnavigating the planet. What a show.

39:52.791 --> 39:53.875
So much money.

39:54.750 --> 39:57.208
One of my favorite things
about human beings.

39:57.208 --> 40:03.416
Starvation, poverty, disease,
you could fix all that, just with money.

40:04.291 --> 40:05.541
And you don't.

40:06.333 --> 40:10.583
I mean, if you took just a little bit
of time off the vanity voyages,

40:10.583 --> 40:13.791
pleasure cruising, billionaire space race,

40:13.791 --> 40:17.250
hell, you stopped making
movies and TV for one year

40:17.250 --> 40:19.750
and you spent that money
on what you really need,

40:20.208 --> 40:22.958
you could solve it all.
With some to spare.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.041
But you were the first to do it.

40:26.666 --> 40:28.583
The Transglobe Expedition.

40:29.833 --> 40:34.958
That man in the desert,
they left him, didn't they?

40:36.208 --> 40:41.041
That guide in the Arctic.
The friendly fire, hit in the gut.

40:42.083 --> 40:43.583
And there was that woman too.

40:44.500 --> 40:45.916
That Inuit woman.

40:47.125 --> 40:48.083
Not you.

40:48.666 --> 40:49.916
You didn't partake.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.041
But you saw what they did.

40:54.875 --> 40:55.875
I saw.

40:57.875 --> 40:58.875
A lot.

41:00.333 --> 41:04.708
We're a... virus, I think.

41:05.666 --> 41:07.000
People, I mean.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.500
Hmm. But you're so damn interesting.

41:10.541 --> 41:12.291
That's why I had to go topside.

41:13.333 --> 41:16.500
I had to see the ship go by
with my own eyes.

41:18.250 --> 41:19.583
And you saw me too.

41:20.416 --> 41:21.416
Didn't you?

41:22.083 --> 41:23.250
Standing on the ice.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.583
The aurora above.

41:28.375 --> 41:30.750
What happens to you
when the Ushers are gone?

41:30.750 --> 41:33.041
Which is imminent, by the way.

41:34.250 --> 41:38.708
You've enjoyed a sense of immunity
throughout your life, but it isn't yours.

41:38.708 --> 41:41.166
It's theirs. Just reflected.

41:41.708 --> 41:42.708
Let me guess.

41:43.625 --> 41:45.291
You can do something about that.

41:45.291 --> 41:46.666
I can.

41:47.125 --> 41:50.041
Like I said to one of my clients,
when I'm done,

41:50.041 --> 41:52.750
you can stand in the middle of 5th Avenue
and shoot somebody,

41:52.750 --> 41:54.208
and it won't cost you a thing.

41:54.208 --> 41:56.750
Is his tab coming due any time soon?

41:57.916 --> 41:59.375
Even I've got my limits.

42:01.041 --> 42:04.166
Fortunato Pharma will be dissolved
in a bankruptcy settlement.

42:04.750 --> 42:08.208
The family trust will turn
over 4.5 billion,

42:08.208 --> 42:12.291
including federal settlement fees paid
in instalments over nine years.

42:13.291 --> 42:14.958
It's a pretty sweet deal.

42:14.958 --> 42:16.750
It's a fucking Christmas present.

42:16.750 --> 42:18.916
It's a slap on the wrist
that comes with a blowjob.

42:19.500 --> 42:20.958
And you can make this happen?

42:21.666 --> 42:23.583
Oh. no, this will happen without me.

42:24.916 --> 42:26.916
Humanity will shit that bed themselves.

42:27.875 --> 42:31.375
Corporate justice in this world
is a punchline.

42:31.916 --> 42:34.833
Then... what are you offering?

42:35.750 --> 42:36.708
There's a file.

42:37.291 --> 42:40.166
Camille L'Espanaye was very good
at what she did.

42:40.833 --> 42:42.333
She had a file on everyone.

42:42.750 --> 42:43.750
Even you.

42:44.250 --> 42:45.750
Barely scratches the surface,

42:45.750 --> 42:48.083
but the surface alone
will get you 20 to life.

42:49.583 --> 42:51.791
It gets found, or it doesn't.

42:53.083 --> 42:57.541
So you can either ride the phoenix
out of Fortunato's ashes,

42:57.541 --> 43:01.083
or you can watch it fly away
from a federal prison cell.

43:02.041 --> 43:03.166
This I can do.

43:04.375 --> 43:06.333
What are you asking in return?

43:08.000 --> 43:13.250
What do you have, Arthur,
in this life you've built for yourself?

43:13.750 --> 43:15.333
What assets have you acquired?

43:16.125 --> 43:20.708
I'm not interested in money,
property, or stock options.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.958
True assets.

43:25.125 --> 43:26.125
What have you got?

43:28.208 --> 43:29.291
No spouse.

43:30.375 --> 43:31.750
No children.

43:33.041 --> 43:36.916
No familial connections.
At least, none that you care about.

43:38.416 --> 43:41.375
But everyone loves something.

43:42.791 --> 43:46.208
And in that love there's collateral.

43:48.208 --> 43:49.208
No.

43:50.625 --> 43:52.125
I have no collateral.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
Collateral is leverage.

43:58.666 --> 44:00.500
And I won't be leveraged.

44:02.000 --> 44:07.708
No man or woman has leveraged me
in 70 years of life.

44:09.291 --> 44:16.208
And I'm not going to cede that ground,
not this close to the end.

44:17.500 --> 44:18.541
So...

44:20.125 --> 44:22.041
Thank you for your consideration.

44:23.291 --> 44:25.041
And for your generous offer.

44:26.416 --> 44:30.500
But I think I'll play out my hand.

44:32.125 --> 44:33.666
If it's all the same to you.

44:37.625 --> 44:38.625
Fair enough.

44:40.291 --> 44:41.208
Hmm.

44:48.291 --> 44:49.291
Thank you.

44:53.083 --> 44:54.666
This has been a pleasure.

45:08.750 --> 45:11.083
[Lenore] <i>I can't believe
you're not at the hospital.</i>

45:11.083 --> 45:15.291
Honey, I know more about hospitals
than anyone would ever want to.

45:15.291 --> 45:17.083
I'll never spend a single night in one.

45:18.500 --> 45:20.041
No, I'm much better here.

45:20.625 --> 45:21.625
I promise you.

45:24.083 --> 45:28.291
[grunts] I'm okay. You don't...
You don't have to stay.

45:28.291 --> 45:29.833
Where am I gonna go?

45:29.833 --> 45:33.916
Mom's in the ICU,
and I am never going home again.

45:34.958 --> 45:36.833
I can't believe Juno left you
by yourself.

45:36.833 --> 45:39.083
Don't be too hard on her.

45:39.083 --> 45:40.250
Where is she, anyway?

45:41.416 --> 45:42.375
Um...

45:42.375 --> 45:44.166
at the Four Seasons.

45:44.666 --> 45:45.791
For now, it's...

45:47.083 --> 45:48.666
Probably a clinic.

45:48.666 --> 45:49.750
Soon enough.

45:50.291 --> 45:51.666
But don't blame her, she's...

45:54.083 --> 45:55.500
She has to do her own thing.

45:55.500 --> 45:57.541
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

45:59.833 --> 46:02.625
And I think maybe...

46:03.458 --> 46:07.458
maybe not having Fortunato anymore...
maybe it's a good thing.

46:08.708 --> 46:10.083
For you.

46:10.666 --> 46:12.291
That place wasn't good, Grandpa.

46:14.875 --> 46:15.958
No, it wasn't.

46:18.791 --> 46:19.875
But it was mine.

46:23.500 --> 46:25.291
And maybe you'll make it good.

46:25.291 --> 46:26.416
Some day.

46:27.166 --> 46:28.750
Can you do that, do you think?

46:35.041 --> 46:36.208
I say this with love.

46:38.083 --> 46:39.083
Let it go.

46:39.916 --> 46:41.000
Let it all go.

46:41.916 --> 46:44.791
I mean, you've got more money
than you'll ever be able to spend.

46:44.791 --> 46:46.541
Than I'll ever be able to spend.

46:47.083 --> 46:48.333
Let's put it to work.

46:49.041 --> 46:50.166
Try to fix things.

46:52.041 --> 46:55.208
Let go of Fortunato, and Ligodone,
and all the bad stuff.

46:55.750 --> 46:57.541
We did bad stuff, Grandpa.

46:57.541 --> 46:59.583
Our family did bad stuff.

47:01.958 --> 47:03.416
It's not too late to fix it.

47:14.583 --> 47:15.583
Get some sleep.

47:15.583 --> 47:17.583
You know, you... you can stay.

47:18.166 --> 47:20.291
I had them make up one of the guest rooms.

47:20.291 --> 47:21.375
Way ahead of you.

47:23.375 --> 47:24.375
Goodnight.

47:40.250 --> 47:41.416
- Who are--
- [Verna shushes]

47:43.583 --> 47:44.833
You know, I told them.

47:46.708 --> 47:48.166
The terms were clear.

47:48.833 --> 47:53.000
And they're just... well, they always had
a hard time focusing on things

47:53.000 --> 47:55.500
outside of their immediate concerns,
didn't they?

47:56.291 --> 47:59.916
I mean, it shouldn't be on me
to have to spell out

47:59.916 --> 48:02.375
the definition of the word bloodline, but...

48:04.500 --> 48:05.333
Have a seat.

48:17.083 --> 48:19.166
There is a lot about my job I love.

48:20.166 --> 48:24.083
But there are moments like these
that bring me no joy.

48:25.458 --> 48:26.541
I hope you know that.

48:28.500 --> 48:31.916
Let me tell you a story about your mother.

48:32.708 --> 48:36.166
See, she recovers very well
now that she's in the clinic.

48:36.791 --> 48:40.208
Takes three years,
more than 100 skin grafts...

48:40.958 --> 48:43.291
physical therapy, reconstructive surgery.

48:43.291 --> 48:44.416
But she endures it.

48:45.083 --> 48:46.083
She's strong.

48:46.708 --> 48:48.791
Her battle scars become armor.

48:49.916 --> 48:53.666
She inherits a sizeable fortune
when Fortunato collapses.

48:54.500 --> 48:56.291
She puts it to work immediately.

48:56.916 --> 48:58.500
She gives most of it away.

48:58.500 --> 49:00.500
Domestic violence and abuse charities.

49:01.333 --> 49:03.666
But keeps enough to start a non-profit.

49:04.500 --> 49:07.583
She sets up chapters all over the world.

49:08.916 --> 49:10.666
She calls it the Lenore Foundation.

49:11.291 --> 49:12.291
After her daughter.

49:13.208 --> 49:15.041
And she saves a lot of lives.

49:16.291 --> 49:17.916
Would you like to know how many?

49:19.875 --> 49:21.583
Dozens in the first year.

49:21.583 --> 49:22.666
Then hundreds.

49:23.250 --> 49:24.708
Thousands soon after.

49:25.208 --> 49:27.208
And then a major burst of growth.

49:27.208 --> 49:33.750
600,000 five years in.
And in a decade, it's millions.

49:34.750 --> 49:36.583
More than 3,000,000, in fact.

49:37.958 --> 49:39.375
Then it gets hard to count.

49:39.958 --> 49:42.666
Because the people she helps help others.

49:42.666 --> 49:45.041
Who help others. And others.

49:45.750 --> 49:46.583
And so on and...

49:50.041 --> 49:52.833
This is the part
I really want you to hear.

49:54.500 --> 49:56.458
You did that.

49:58.333 --> 50:03.916
When you got her out of the house,
when you defied your father, you did that.

50:04.625 --> 50:06.250
You saved those people.

50:06.791 --> 50:11.291
That choice you made echoes
through millions of lives.

50:13.166 --> 50:14.791
I thought you should know that.

50:22.791 --> 50:24.666
[Auguste] <i>Wait.
What are you talking about?</i>

50:24.666 --> 50:26.458
Lenore Usher isn't dead.

50:26.958 --> 50:27.791
She is.

50:29.333 --> 50:30.583
She died earlier tonight.

50:31.208 --> 50:32.833
That's not possible, Roderick.

50:33.333 --> 50:34.208
That's not...

50:34.833 --> 50:36.708
She's been texting you all night.

50:37.166 --> 50:39.333
Madeline had this project.

50:42.083 --> 50:45.125
Sentient AI project.

50:45.125 --> 50:48.125
Scans your social media posts
and makes a digital you.

50:49.958 --> 50:51.208
She never did crack it.

50:51.833 --> 50:53.000
I think she would have.

50:53.583 --> 50:55.416
- [thunder rumbling]
- Given more time.

50:55.416 --> 51:00.750
But she... she used Lenore as a beta test.

51:02.083 --> 51:03.333
Made this...

51:06.333 --> 51:08.583
Lenore bot, a little bit ago.

51:12.208 --> 51:15.791
I guess the goddamn thing was activated
because it's been texting me.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
All night.

51:20.625 --> 51:21.958
It's stuck on...

51:26.333 --> 51:28.208
some nonsense.

51:29.958 --> 51:32.250
[thunder rumbling]

51:42.958 --> 51:46.375
<i>Once upon a midnight dreary</i>

51:48.791 --> 51:50.666
<i>While I pondered</i>

51:52.166 --> 51:55.875
<i>Weak... and weary</i>

51:56.833 --> 51:59.125
[thunder rumbling]

52:08.750 --> 52:10.750
[raven squawking]

52:16.958 --> 52:18.041
[squawks]

52:28.208 --> 52:29.041
[squawks]

52:29.041 --> 52:31.125
[thunder rumbling]

52:36.291 --> 52:42.583
<i>Deep into that darkness peering
Long I stood there, wondering, fearing</i>

52:42.583 --> 52:47.666
<i>Doubting, dreaming dreams
No mortal ever dared to dream before</i>

52:49.041 --> 52:54.500
<i>The silence was unbroken
And the stillness gave no token</i>

52:54.500 --> 52:59.833
<i>And the only word there spoken
Was the whispered word, "Lenore"</i>

53:06.166 --> 53:08.250
[squawking]

53:12.666 --> 53:14.416
[thunder rumbling]

53:26.250 --> 53:31.333
<i>And the raven never flitting
Still is sitting, still is sitting</i>

53:31.333 --> 53:35.583
<i>On the pallid bust of Pallas
Just above my chamber door</i>

53:36.916 --> 53:42.416
<i>And his eyes have all the seeming
Of a demon's that is dreaming</i>

53:42.416 --> 53:47.041
<i>And the lamplight o'er him streaming
Throws his shadow on the floor</i>

53:49.000 --> 53:53.958
<i>And my soul, from out that shadow
That lies floating on the floor</i>

53:54.583 --> 53:57.791
<i>Shall be lifted nevermore</i>

54:31.875 --> 54:33.750
I guess we've finally come to it.

54:36.166 --> 54:37.000
Haven't we?

54:43.875 --> 54:45.875
World without pain.

54:47.500 --> 54:48.750
That was the whole point.

54:52.750 --> 54:55.500
Nobody can stomach a little discomfort.

54:56.916 --> 55:01.166
It hurts. It hurts and they cry and cry,
and I took it away!

55:02.000 --> 55:05.500
I reached in and snuffed out those flames
in their backs,

55:05.500 --> 55:08.166
in their joints,
their heads and their hands.

55:08.166 --> 55:12.333
I waved my wand, wasn't enough.

55:13.666 --> 55:15.000
Was never enough.

55:17.041 --> 55:18.625
They just kept wanting more.

55:19.500 --> 55:20.875
More and more.

55:20.875 --> 55:22.375
[Verna] Oh, honey.

55:22.375 --> 55:24.083
Don't kid a kidder.

55:26.666 --> 55:28.416
Did you drive here like that?

55:29.458 --> 55:32.125
When was the last time
you drove your own car?

55:33.625 --> 55:38.166
And tonight you do it barefoot.

55:39.416 --> 55:40.541
Good for you.

55:41.833 --> 55:47.208
You know, I've worked with a lot
of truly influential people over the years

55:47.208 --> 55:53.250
but when it comes to sheer body count,
you're in my top five.

55:54.166 --> 55:55.041
Take a look.

56:00.750 --> 56:01.875
Those are your bodies.

56:03.541 --> 56:06.083
They'd each be alive today
if it weren't for you.

56:07.041 --> 56:10.625
New one every five minutes.
Just in the States, but...

56:12.583 --> 56:14.333
open it up to the world.

56:22.083 --> 56:23.625
Why did you come here tonight?

56:24.333 --> 56:25.416
On your way home.

56:26.333 --> 56:28.833
Your real home.

56:30.333 --> 56:31.875
Was it to say goodbye?

56:33.208 --> 56:38.291
One last look at your great tower.

56:40.291 --> 56:41.541
Your pyramid.

56:41.541 --> 56:43.166
[thunder rumbling]

56:53.916 --> 56:55.875
That's your true monument, Roderick.

56:56.958 --> 56:58.208
Out there.

56:58.708 --> 57:01.000
It's a wonder of the world.

57:01.541 --> 57:03.916
And it's eternal.

57:13.333 --> 57:14.833
That's your legacy.

57:18.375 --> 57:20.000
Give yourself a minute.

57:20.833 --> 57:22.250
And then find your way home.

57:23.583 --> 57:25.458
Our business is almost done.

57:26.916 --> 57:30.750
You're going to call Auguste Dupin
and ask him to meet you.

57:43.291 --> 57:45.375
And that was tonight?

57:46.041 --> 57:48.000
- [Roderick] It was.
- [thuds]

57:50.416 --> 57:52.250
You said that's Madeline down there.

57:56.125 --> 57:57.833
It is. At least, I think it is.

57:58.875 --> 58:01.041
I called you and I came here.

58:19.583 --> 58:20.583
Roderick?

58:22.458 --> 58:24.041
Roderick, are you here?

58:24.916 --> 58:25.916
[Roderick] Down here.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.916
I got your message
and I don't know what to say.

58:58.083 --> 58:59.416
So that's it, is it?

59:01.166 --> 59:02.583
Nothing more we can do.

59:02.583 --> 59:03.625
[chuckles]

59:03.625 --> 59:04.750
There is nothing.

59:05.916 --> 59:08.541
And she's giving us a few minutes
to talk, so...

59:08.541 --> 59:10.333
I guess there must be some...

59:11.500 --> 59:13.291
Something we're meant to wrap up.

59:15.375 --> 59:16.416
Drink?

59:16.416 --> 59:18.541
You know what? Yes, why the fuck not?

59:26.750 --> 59:29.666
You always said it was you and me
against the world.

59:30.958 --> 59:32.416
Said we'd change the world.

59:33.083 --> 59:34.416
We did, didn't we?

59:34.416 --> 59:35.541
We did.

59:39.666 --> 59:40.791
[sighs]

59:43.291 --> 59:45.208
When did you start bringing
this stuff here?

59:45.208 --> 59:46.666
Some of this is mine, isn't it?

59:46.666 --> 59:47.750
[Roderick] Few days ago.

59:48.666 --> 59:50.166
Same reason the pharaohs did.

59:52.166 --> 59:54.125
I mean this house, this...

59:55.625 --> 59:59.958
this carcass of a house, this is our tomb.

01:00:00.541 --> 01:00:03.583
So, we need all the dressing, all the...

01:00:04.458 --> 01:00:07.125
All this treasure, for the afterlife.

01:00:07.125 --> 01:00:10.291
Please, treasure.
What the fuck does that even mean?

01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:17.000
Gold's just a... transition metal element,
nothing special.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.958
Money's not even gold anymore,
it's just ones and zeros.

01:00:19.958 --> 01:00:22.291
It's a lie agreed upon.

01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:24.541
We built a life.

01:00:25.291 --> 01:00:30.041
A privileged fucking life,
out of nothing but dirt and trauma,

01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:32.791
empty pockets and broken hearts.

01:00:32.791 --> 01:00:36.125
We did that. And say what you will,
it was fucking substantial.

01:00:36.125 --> 01:00:37.208
It was.

01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:39.416
Would we have done anything different

01:00:39.416 --> 01:00:41.916
if we'd believed
that woman in the bar was real?

01:00:42.375 --> 01:00:44.375
I suppose that's the only question left.

01:00:45.416 --> 01:00:46.791
Did you believe it? I...

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:53.125
Honestly, I can't remember
what I believed.

01:00:53.125 --> 01:00:55.166
I believed it enough to get an I.U.D.

01:00:55.166 --> 01:00:58.166
And you still wouldn't glove up
with the fucking stewardesses.

01:00:58.166 --> 01:00:59.500
I was who I was.

01:01:00.333 --> 01:01:01.875
And I loved you for that.

01:01:04.958 --> 01:01:07.500
And the fucking people,
the fucking people out there, Roderick.

01:01:08.083 --> 01:01:10.000
You don't want Ligodone, don't buy it,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.958
you don't want to get addicted,
don't abuse it.

01:01:11.958 --> 01:01:14.875
They're mad because we made it
available and desirable.

01:01:14.875 --> 01:01:17.833
Hey, newsflash, it's our only fucking job.

01:01:17.833 --> 01:01:19.291
These people.

01:01:19.833 --> 01:01:23.208
They want an entire meal
for $5 in five minutes

01:01:23.208 --> 01:01:25.708
then complain
when it's made of shit and plastic.

01:01:25.708 --> 01:01:29.500
McDonald's would serve nothing
but kale salad all day and all night long

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.041
if that's what people fucking ate.

01:01:31.041 --> 01:01:33.083
It's available, no one buys it.

01:01:33.625 --> 01:01:35.625
We will get around to funding
AIDS research,

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:37.958
and diabetes, and heart disease,

01:01:37.958 --> 01:01:40.333
just as soon as we figure out

01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:43.791
how to keep our geriatric dicks
harder for a few more minutes.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.166
What's the market share
on wimpy dicks, Roderick?

01:01:47.166 --> 01:01:50.250
60-70% of the healthcare industry.

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:54.375
The Pentagon spent $83 million
on Viagra last year.

01:01:54.958 --> 01:01:59.958
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court,
the fucking Supreme Court does its part,

01:01:59.958 --> 01:02:04.791
tears the autonomy,
rips the liberty away from women,

01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:08.375
shreds not just their choice
but their future, their potential.

01:02:09.208 --> 01:02:12.500
We turn men into cum fountains
and women into factories,

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.750
cranking out, what,
an impoverished workforce,

01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:20.916
there for the labor and to spend
what little they make consuming.

01:02:21.875 --> 01:02:22.875
Hmm.

01:02:24.416 --> 01:02:26.333
And what do we teach them to want?

01:02:27.916 --> 01:02:31.250
Houses they can't afford.
Cars that poison the air.

01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:32.833
Single-serve plastics,

01:02:32.833 --> 01:02:37.291
clothes made by starving children
in third world countries,

01:02:37.291 --> 01:02:40.500
and they want it so bad
that they're begging for it,

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.083
they're screaming for it,
they're insisting upon it.

01:02:43.666 --> 01:02:46.458
And <i>we're</i> the problem?

01:02:47.416 --> 01:02:52.625
These fucking monsters,
these fucking consumers,

01:02:52.625 --> 01:02:54.000
these fucking mouths.

01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:57.166
They point at you and me
like we're the problem.

01:02:57.166 --> 01:02:58.583
They fucking invented us.

01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:01.166
They begged for us,
they're begging for us still.

01:03:02.708 --> 01:03:06.458
So I say,
we stand tall and proud, brother.

01:03:06.958 --> 01:03:08.041
Bill's come due.

01:03:08.041 --> 01:03:12.500
Let's not hide here in the basement
like we've got something to be ashamed of.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.375
No. Not us. You and me against the world.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.625
Don't care if it's Death herself.

01:03:17.625 --> 01:03:19.625
If she wants Madeline fucking Usher,

01:03:20.333 --> 01:03:24.125
she's going to have to look me
straight in the eyes.

01:03:31.833 --> 01:03:32.666
[grunts softly]

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.791
[breath trembling]

01:03:36.791 --> 01:03:37.833
[sighs]

01:03:38.708 --> 01:03:40.250
I'm sorry.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:42.625
You motherfuck...

01:03:43.375 --> 01:03:44.583
[gasps]

01:03:48.333 --> 01:03:49.333
I'm sorry.

01:03:50.291 --> 01:03:51.666
You're right.

01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:55.833
You're Madeline fucking Usher.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.291
You are a queen.

01:04:19.875 --> 01:04:20.791
You're a goddess.

01:04:22.791 --> 01:04:24.583
And you're gonna live forever.

01:04:28.416 --> 01:04:29.583
What did you do?

01:04:29.583 --> 01:04:31.500
I sent her off like a queen.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.750
[thuds]

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.041
Queen Twosret, as a matter of fact.

01:04:40.541 --> 01:04:41.916
She's getting acclimated.

01:04:42.875 --> 01:04:46.125
That's why they buried them
with the things they buried them with.

01:04:46.125 --> 01:04:47.625
Things needed in the afterlife.

01:04:47.625 --> 01:04:49.291
She'll have all she needs down there.

01:04:49.291 --> 01:04:50.541
[clattering]

01:04:50.541 --> 01:04:52.458
Just takes a little getting used to.

01:04:53.375 --> 01:04:54.833
What did you do to her?

01:04:54.833 --> 01:04:55.916
I loved her.

01:04:56.416 --> 01:04:57.666
I honored her.

01:04:57.666 --> 01:05:00.541
Right. And after you "honored" her...

01:05:01.541 --> 01:05:03.333
Are you sure she was dead?

01:05:07.625 --> 01:05:08.916
You know, maybe not.

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:15.250
Now you mention it,
it makes perfect sense. [chuckles]

01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:16.958
Our mother was the same way.

01:05:17.916 --> 01:05:20.750
Thank you for coming tonight, Auggie.

01:05:21.458 --> 01:05:26.208
I'm sorry for all the times
I inconvenienced you.

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:29.250
It may not have been perfect,

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:31.583
but you can't say
we didn't change the world.

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:35.875
How many people can say that at the end?

01:05:35.875 --> 01:05:37.500
[clattering]

01:05:42.166 --> 01:05:43.916
I promised my confession.

01:05:44.666 --> 01:05:45.708
And here it is.

01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:47.875
I knew.

01:05:49.791 --> 01:05:50.625
Deep down.

01:05:51.958 --> 01:05:53.041
In the witching hour.

01:05:54.541 --> 01:05:55.541
I knew.

01:05:56.666 --> 01:06:00.625
I knew I would climb to the top
of the tower on a pile of corpses.

01:06:02.541 --> 01:06:07.958
And we told them...
it was about soothing the world's pain.

01:06:07.958 --> 01:06:09.250
[loud clattering]

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:11.208
That's the biggest lie we told.

01:06:11.833 --> 01:06:13.958
You can't eliminate pain.

01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:18.541
There's no such thing as a painkiller.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.875
And imagine if we'd put that
on the bottle.

01:06:32.416 --> 01:06:33.958
I bet I still could have sold it.

01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:36.166
[thunderclap]

01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:37.416
[screaming]

01:06:47.333 --> 01:06:49.166
[screaming]

01:06:54.166 --> 01:06:55.000
Nevermore.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.583
[screaming]

01:07:56.708 --> 01:07:58.208
[squawking]

01:08:02.041 --> 01:08:04.791
[Auguste] <i>"There was a long tumultuous
shouting sound</i>

01:08:04.791 --> 01:08:07.750

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.583
<i>and the deep and dank tarn

01:08:14.583 --> 01:08:19.250
<i>and silently over the fragments

01:08:24.625 --> 01:08:27.000
<i>It pulled other things down
into the Earth with it.</i>

01:08:27.583 --> 01:08:30.125
<i>My case for one, pointless now.</i>

01:08:30.916 --> 01:08:32.208
<i>I put in for retirement.</i>

01:08:33.041 --> 01:08:34.208
<i>And I went home.</i>

01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:37.458
<i>Juno inherited everything.</i>

01:08:37.958 --> 01:08:40.458
<i>And she completely dissolved it.</i>

01:08:41.125 --> 01:08:46.041
<i>Fortunato Pharmaceuticals was shuttered.
Stripped for parts.</i>

01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:49.000
<i>Repurposed into the Phoenix Foundation.</i>

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.833

for rehabilitation programs,</i>

01:08:51.833 --> 01:08:53.916
<i>addiction and recovery research.</i>

01:08:53.916 --> 01:08:58.208
<i>And she weaned herself off Ligodone.</i>

01:08:58.791 --> 01:09:00.083
<i>Completely.</i>

01:09:03.083 --> 01:09:05.916
<i>Arthur Pym was arrested a few weeks later,</i>

01:09:06.625 --> 01:09:09.083
<i>after Camille's former assistants
turned over</i>

01:09:09.083 --> 01:09:11.458
<i>a mountain of files to the police.</i>

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.458
<i>He surrendered himself at the courtroom.</i>

01:09:22.208 --> 01:09:26.250
<i>And didn't utter a word in his defense.</i>

01:09:29.333 --> 01:09:33.125
<i>He remains the only conviction
from the Fortunato Pharmaceuticals case.</i>

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:35.958
<i>And he will die in prison.</i>

01:09:43.916 --> 01:09:45.583
The regulators are working.

01:09:47.083 --> 01:09:49.083
Trying to stop the bleeding.

01:09:49.916 --> 01:09:51.583
Opioid epidemic's with us now.

01:09:51.583 --> 01:09:55.541
You tattooed it on the world,
but they're trying to take it down.

01:09:56.083 --> 01:09:57.083
Take it apart.

01:09:57.916 --> 01:09:58.916
Heal it.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.500
Didn't know what to do with this.

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:14.458
Because it don't matter in the end
why you did any of it.

01:10:14.458 --> 01:10:16.375
I don't fucking care why you did it.

01:10:18.333 --> 01:10:24.166
We don't want your confession,
or your rationale, or your explanation.

01:10:25.041 --> 01:10:27.250
So take all that with you, why don't you.

01:10:30.833 --> 01:10:31.916
Goodbye, Roderick.

01:10:32.791 --> 01:10:33.875
I'm going home...

01:10:37.541 --> 01:10:38.541
to my husband.

01:10:39.375 --> 01:10:40.416
My kids.

01:10:41.125 --> 01:10:42.125
Their kids.

01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:46.875
I'm the richest man in the world.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:48.583
You know that?

01:10:57.125 --> 01:10:58.625
