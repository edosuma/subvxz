I'm ready to run

I don't currently
have the power necessary

00:06.824 --> 00:08.690
to protect
the people I love the most.

00:08.793 --> 00:11.744
This isn't about power,
but activism.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.495
They terrorized me.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.848
Some of the guys
were talking about us

00:15.950 --> 00:18.283
because isaiah might be gay.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.285

[ralph] I never thought
I see myself
leaving this land.

01:15.976 --> 01:17.526
It's in my blood, you know.

01:18.145 --> 01:19.611
I was born here.

I know things
are uncertain right now,

01:39.884 --> 01:42.968
but one thing
that I know for sure,

01:44.755 --> 01:46.472
is that wherever we are,

01:48.008 --> 01:50.109
that's exactly
where we're supposed to be.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.262
And nobody,

01:53.347 --> 01:56.515
not even the landrys
can change that.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.120
Our baby girl

02:04.041 --> 02:08.594
We need to prepare for her

02:08.712 --> 02:14.049
And if that includes
living on this land, so be it.

02:17.354 --> 02:19.721

the reason though we haven't

12:07.010 --> 12:08.927
seen full liberation
in america is because

12:09.012 --> 12:11.295
some black people don't know
they're not fully free.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.648
Hmm. Now that's the truth.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.735
Folk around here
are tip-toeing,
scared to live.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.154
You want to see to change,
maybe we got to be
the ones to do it.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.155
[micah] exactly.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.991
Black people have
to think outside the box.

12:23.110 --> 12:26.277
We have to think radically
and believe
change is possible,

12:26.363 --> 12:27.478
and do the work
to make it happen.

12:27.581 --> 12:28.980
-Every day.
-That's right.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.231
-That's strong.
-[hollywood] yeah.

12:34.838 --> 12:38.673
[phone ringing]

12:39.760 --> 12:41.092
twice in one day?

12:41.178 --> 12:42.627
You must really miss me.

12:42.712 --> 12:44.095
[davis on the phone]
<i> I do miss you.</i>

12:44.181 --> 12:45.430
So what do you doing tonight?

12:45.515 --> 12:48.933
Well, I'm
finishing some work now.

12:49.019 --> 12:52.103
Planning on relaxing
with a glass of wine,

12:52.189 --> 12:53.438
doing some reading.

12:54.391 --> 12:56.057
And if I didn't make
it clear,

12:56.810 --> 12:58.476
I miss you too.

12:58.562 --> 13:01.146
Okay, well I'm glad
you're planning to relax

13:01.231 --> 13:04.783
and not work because I got
you tickets to something fun.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.785
-What?
-[davis]
<i> there's a car outside.</i>

13:07.938 --> 13:10.655
[music playing]

13:10.740 --> 13:13.825
excuse me,
I have things to do, mr. West.

13:13.910 --> 13:15.627
You can't just go
throw in something

13:15.712 --> 13:17.378
like tickets at me.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.997
Car's outside.

13:19.082 --> 13:20.632
Call me
from the next location,

13:20.717 --> 13:21.716
and bring an overnight bag.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.335
-Wait, what?
-Bye.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.040
But, uh, where am I going?

13:29.142 --> 13:34.012
[music playing]

13:35.098 --> 13:37.232
I'm feeling the applebee's
on your playlists.

13:38.268 --> 13:40.485
I love it. Best music
I've ever heard.

13:40.570 --> 13:41.769
Hmm.

13:41.872 --> 13:44.022
The jazz-funk mixed with
the african rhythms
and chants.

13:44.107 --> 13:45.740
-Pure fire.
-Mm.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.725
Ay!

13:47.828 --> 13:49.410
-[both] ay!
-[both chuckle]

13:53.450 --> 13:56.334
st. John the baptist parish
is an interesting place.

13:56.419 --> 13:57.669
And a bloody one.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.255
The biggest slave uprising
in us history.

14:00.373 --> 14:03.241
Black bodies died here
trying to get to freedom.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.043
I'm working on a project right
now at the governor's office,

14:05.128 --> 14:07.045
it's part of the reclaimed
black land initiative.

14:07.130 --> 14:09.547
We find land that was stolen
from black folks
or destroyed.

14:09.633 --> 14:13.251
Get it declared historic site,
in that way it makes it much
harder to be torn down.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.719
-And what about developed?
-Mm.

14:14.804 --> 14:16.387
But not without a lot
of heartache and money.

14:17.474 --> 14:18.723
I was just in baton rouge,

14:18.808 --> 14:20.775
commemorating an
all black cemetery
called the sweet olive.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.227
The first of it's kind
back in the day.

14:23.146 --> 14:24.229
Respect.

14:24.314 --> 14:25.480
Thank you for doing that.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.736
Oh, oh, oh.

14:31.821 --> 14:33.621
-[nova chuckles]
-so, where are we headed?

14:33.740 --> 14:35.290
I have an idea,

14:35.408 --> 14:36.908
but I want it
to be a surprise.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.110
A surprise?

14:39.212 --> 14:40.078
Surprise.

14:40.547 --> 14:45.383
[music playing]

14:48.972 --> 14:49.888
[clears throat]

14:50.974 --> 14:51.923
how you doing, man?

14:53.310 --> 14:54.475
Straight.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.795
I know it's tough on you,
but I--

14:57.898 --> 14:59.347
but you were right.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.016
I messed up.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.752
I ain't going to be
doing that no more.

15:05.322 --> 15:06.771
Damn right you won't.

15:11.194 --> 15:12.160
We good?

15:19.669 --> 15:21.002
[ralph] I love you, wood.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.287
Love you too, brother.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.488
[micah] alright, gentlemen.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.592
Without further ado,
the exhibit is now open.

15:28.545 --> 15:30.428
Let's see what you're
working with, nephew.

15:30.513 --> 15:31.846
Come on in. Come on in.

15:32.515 --> 15:35.300
All right. Damn, nephew.

15:35.385 --> 15:37.936
We find out you got
all the talent in the family.

15:38.021 --> 15:40.021
You're trying to say
my barbecue's skill
ain't no talent?

15:41.775 --> 15:43.841
-[ralph] now this
is nice, nephew.
-[micah] thank you.

15:43.944 --> 15:47.645
Is this is what you mean
about changing things?

15:48.398 --> 15:49.647
What do you mean?

15:49.733 --> 15:51.699
[cardale]
y'all real close here.

15:51.818 --> 15:55.453
Y'all taking this brother love
to a whole another level.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.488
Oh, no offense,
but, it just sounds like

15:57.574 --> 16:00.208
you're not used to seeing
black men love on each other.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.160
Not like this, I ain't.

16:02.245 --> 16:04.495
What's wrong with two black
men showing each other love?

16:04.581 --> 16:06.381
Nothing. All right.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.383
-Hey, we good in here, right?
-Yeah.

16:10.754 --> 16:11.636
[sighs]

16:13.723 --> 16:14.973
[ralph] I don't want
to hear it.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.191
[music playing]

16:33.276 --> 16:34.242
[exhales]

16:48.208 --> 16:49.957
[heartbeat getting faster]

17:06.059 --> 17:07.258
-you all right?
-I'm straight.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.976
[cardale] I ain't like
this one here.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.528
They all up onto each other.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.647
Oh, cardale, you're
reading too much into it, man.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.116
-They're friends.
-And even if they wasn't...

17:15.902 --> 17:17.869
-So what?
-No, we're just friends.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.905
Look man,
I'm just saying you got
let people be who they are.

17:20.990 --> 17:23.541
My son used
to play with dolls,
I weren't tripping.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.493
If you spent
sometime overseas,

17:25.578 --> 17:28.162
you see men showing
each other affection in public

17:28.248 --> 17:29.714
and it's no problem.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.383
When I was in rwanda,
black men would hold hands

17:32.469 --> 17:34.452
just walking down the street.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.003
Okay, well.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.807
You ain't in rwanda no more.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.226
That's all I'm saying.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.489
I've driven
by this place so many times.

17:55.859 --> 17:57.492
Never thought
I step foot in it, though.

17:57.944 --> 17:58.976
Really?

17:59.079 --> 17:59.961
Why is that?

18:03.867 --> 18:05.416
We can leave if you want.

18:06.753 --> 18:07.785
No, we can stay.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.321
I believe it's
a self-guided walking tour,

18:10.423 --> 18:11.622
we just have
to download the app.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.257
Sounds good.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.881
-[dominic] it's like--
-[nova] feels like
an eerie, unquiet.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.966
-[dominic] yeah.
-[nova] aerie silence.

18:22.051 --> 18:23.167
[dominic]
walking through history.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.802
[nova] yeah.

18:37.567 --> 18:39.233
The things they did to us.

18:41.905 --> 18:43.404
And do to us.

18:46.743 --> 18:49.410
It's a wonder we
don't pick up every gun,

18:50.246 --> 18:52.130
knife, bat,

18:53.082 --> 18:54.415
rock, it's just...

19:00.173 --> 19:01.222
It's a wonder.

19:17.607 --> 19:20.041
[hollywood]
hey, baby, I'm home.

19:20.143 --> 19:23.578
Oh, baby, micah's gallery,
that thing was
something serious.

19:24.581 --> 19:25.780
[hollywood]
where you at, babe?

19:27.834 --> 19:28.749
Violet?

19:31.538 --> 19:33.154
-Oh, sh! Violet!
-Hmm?

19:33.256 --> 19:34.655
Baby.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.340
-What happened?
-I'm okay.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.209
-I'm okay. I'm okay.
-What happened?

19:41.214 --> 19:42.380
Well,

19:43.433 --> 19:46.250
I lost my balance
and took a 'lil fall.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.435
Come on, babe, we're going.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.721
-Going where?
-To the hospital.

19:50.807 --> 19:53.257
Hollywood,
I'm not going to the hospital.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.775
Violet,
don't fight me on this.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.044
Baby,

19:57.146 --> 19:59.697
you know this is
not my first flare up.

19:59.782 --> 20:00.931
I'm all right.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.183
Baby you're fainting.

20:02.986 --> 20:03.951
Look at your arm.

20:05.538 --> 20:10.074
All I need are some meds,
water, and a little rest.

20:10.159 --> 20:11.959
That's it. I'm good.

20:13.379 --> 20:14.829
I'm all right.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.780
Baby, if you
don't get no better,

20:16.883 --> 20:20.451
by the end of the night I'm
taking you to the hospital.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.419
Okay.

20:22.722 --> 20:23.754
Okay.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.290
-Grab my neck.
-All right.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.892
-Let's get up. Let's get up.
-Okay.

20:27.977 --> 20:29.093
-All right.
-Let's get up.

20:29.178 --> 20:30.344
-Ah! Okay. Yeah.
-Baby, you good?

20:30.813 --> 20:31.896
Yeah. Yeah.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.431
-All right. Come on.
-Yeah.

20:33.516 --> 20:35.933
Come on,
let's walk back and sit down.

20:36.019 --> 20:38.686
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

20:38.771 --> 20:39.904
-I'm good.
-All right.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.657
-I'll get you some water.
-Thank you.

20:54.871 --> 20:59.874
[girls playing and singing]

21:24.484 --> 21:25.866
[whispering indistinctly]

21:38.298 --> 21:39.680
[inaudible]

21:48.474 --> 21:50.675
you're very pretty.

21:50.760 --> 21:53.561
And you're very pretty too,
always know that.

21:54.347 --> 21:55.346
I do.

21:55.431 --> 21:56.380
Hey, come on girls.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.849
Come on, livvie pearl.
Daddy calling us.

22:08.711 --> 22:10.027
They

22:11.581 --> 22:13.331
are the wonder.

22:19.155 --> 22:20.988
Oh, man, I'm starving.

22:22.325 --> 22:24.158
Do I order pizza or something?
I promise not to...

22:25.128 --> 22:26.460
Put mushrooms
on it this time.

22:27.330 --> 22:28.662
No, I'm no hungry.

22:34.220 --> 22:36.137
Thinking about
where your next exhibit
is going to be?

22:37.006 --> 22:38.222
Not gonna be one.

22:39.675 --> 22:40.674
Why not?

22:41.394 --> 22:43.210
You just had
your first successful opening,

22:43.312 --> 22:44.562
you got
to keep up that momentum.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.013
That's what
you call successful?

22:46.899 --> 22:47.815
Come on, for--

22:47.900 --> 22:48.983
they didn't like my work.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.718
No, it was just
one random old dude.

22:51.821 --> 22:53.654
They probably didn't like it
either. They just...

22:53.740 --> 22:55.689
Had to defend me
because I'm their family.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.977
Or they actually
liked your photos.

23:04.033 --> 23:05.065
Come on, I know you.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.701
You got more confidence
in yourself than this.

23:09.705 --> 23:10.921
What's up?

23:11.023 --> 23:14.408
Ain't let that old school
talk gets to you, right?

23:14.510 --> 23:15.593
No, of course not.

23:16.212 --> 23:17.228
Good.

23:18.548 --> 23:20.548
Good, cause your work
is beautiful, man, really.

23:26.222 --> 23:27.221
Why are you tripping?

23:28.608 --> 23:30.508
I don't know man,
I just got a lot on my mind.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.060
Are you serious, micah?

23:35.698 --> 23:37.598
And you front like
your conscious, but really,

23:37.700 --> 23:38.866
you've just
been virtue signaling?

23:41.621 --> 23:44.054
You can't let
that toxic bullshit in.

23:49.912 --> 23:50.795
Talk to me.

23:58.588 --> 24:00.054
Right, no. Okay.

24:00.923 --> 24:02.139
You know, I wouldn't
be surprised

24:02.258 --> 24:04.675
if you're just
talking shit about
me with everybody else.

24:04.760 --> 24:05.976
That's what
you think about me?

24:07.480 --> 24:09.013
The only one who defends you
in the frat

24:09.098 --> 24:10.147
makes fun of you
for being gay?

24:10.266 --> 24:12.766
But I never said
what I was, I don't have to.

24:14.737 --> 24:17.638
My sexuality
doesn't need defending, micah.

24:17.740 --> 24:18.823
You are not a superhero.

24:23.162 --> 24:24.328
I don't know
where you are right now.

24:36.125 --> 24:37.508
[hollywood] baby,
how you feeling?

24:37.627 --> 24:38.626
Lousy.

24:40.930 --> 24:43.430
I bet you feel better
when you see who's here.

24:43.516 --> 24:46.884
Uh-uh, hollywood,
I don't want
to see anybody. I'm...

24:46.969 --> 24:48.018
Look, a hot mess.

24:48.137 --> 24:50.187
Oh, you wanna see who this is.

24:50.857 --> 24:51.939
Come on in.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.140
What?

25:01.868 --> 25:03.200
How you doing, aunt violet?

25:05.872 --> 25:07.705
Wood told me you
wasn't feeling good.

25:08.508 --> 25:09.823
I just want to check on you.

25:11.994 --> 25:13.160
I'm okay.

25:14.163 --> 25:16.347
I just have to rest.

25:16.449 --> 25:18.799
I know we kind of started
talking the other day, but...

25:20.670 --> 25:22.319
I still want to
make things right.

25:25.491 --> 25:27.541
-I've never seen--
-you're doing the best you can

25:27.643 --> 25:29.226
and that's all you can do.

25:29.328 --> 25:31.145
You're a good family man.

25:32.815 --> 25:34.181
Like your daddy.

25:36.018 --> 25:37.851
I looked up that school.

25:40.523 --> 25:43.641
And it was one of the best
schools in the country.

25:45.861 --> 25:51.115
And I am so proud that you
had the good sense

25:51.200 --> 25:55.336
to send blue there, so that
he can get a great education.

25:56.839 --> 25:58.672
I mean,
he indefinitely gifted.

26:00.876 --> 26:02.876
I can't hold 'em back,
you know.

26:03.763 --> 26:04.762
That's right.

26:07.183 --> 26:08.182
I was just hurt.

26:11.053 --> 26:12.519
Blue leaving us...

26:13.022 --> 26:14.254
Leaving me and...

26:14.357 --> 26:15.773
You know I miss him too.

26:17.893 --> 26:19.526
Really, I'm just glad
he wasn't here to see

26:19.612 --> 26:21.228
everything
going on with the farm.

26:22.448 --> 26:23.530
That's for sure.

26:24.617 --> 26:27.735
I saw what those damn landrys
did to your crop.

26:31.457 --> 26:34.825
You got so many forces

26:34.927 --> 26:37.745
up against you as a black man
in this world.

26:38.547 --> 26:40.914
As a black father
in this world.

26:44.253 --> 26:46.337
You get enough pain
from the outside,

26:46.422 --> 26:48.672
you don't need it
from your family.

26:48.758 --> 26:50.090
And when I was wrong?

26:51.227 --> 26:52.977
I made some bad decisions.

26:56.649 --> 26:59.316
I guess I just want you
to know where my heart was.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.653
Was in the right place?

27:02.772 --> 27:04.605
I know it is.

27:06.942 --> 27:09.460
But you ain't lost nothing
that you can't get back.

27:11.113 --> 27:12.579
You still got family.

27:13.949 --> 27:15.616
You still got love.

27:17.086 --> 27:18.102
That's what matters.

27:23.292 --> 27:25.659
But I promised your daddy

27:25.761 --> 27:27.628
that I was gonna
take care of y'all.

27:29.432 --> 27:31.715
No matter
how hard headed you are.

27:31.801 --> 27:33.267
I just don't wanna lose you.

27:34.970 --> 27:37.187
I need you to take
care yourself, aunt vi.

27:39.141 --> 27:41.108
I don't know what
I'd do if I lose you.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.477
Well, you don't
worry about that.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.647
Because, god willing,
I ain't going nowhere.

27:47.533 --> 27:48.532
Good.

27:49.652 --> 27:50.534
In fact,

27:51.654 --> 27:52.953
I'm already feeling better.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.348
after all that walking
we did today,

28:04.450 --> 28:06.800
I definitely could have a meal
that will stick to my ribs.

28:08.804 --> 28:10.054

It's my bosses.

28:13.142 --> 28:14.975
Everything okay?

28:15.061 --> 28:17.261
I was supposed
to turn something in to them
by the end of the day,

28:17.346 --> 28:19.646
but, uh, it's okay.

28:19.732 --> 28:21.565
It's worth it to come
on this trip. I needed it.

28:21.684 --> 28:24.151
You were wrestled
to the ground and handcuffed,

28:24.236 --> 28:26.987
and deserve a moment
to reflect, and just...

28:28.190 --> 28:29.239
Recalibrate...

28:31.026 --> 28:32.893
That day'll be with me
for the rest of my life.

28:32.995 --> 28:34.111
Yeah, I mean,
that kind of thing,

28:34.196 --> 28:35.446
leaves permanent scars.

28:35.531 --> 28:39.032
It's like... So many scars.

28:40.002 --> 28:41.919
Scars mean
healing has happened.

28:42.037 --> 28:43.370
We won't live in fear.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.340
We won't let them when win.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.293
I came on this trip

28:49.378 --> 28:51.595
because I wanted to make sure
that you're okay and safe.

28:52.598 --> 28:53.547
And, um...

28:54.850 --> 28:56.249
Honestly I...

28:56.352 --> 28:58.302
I just want to get
to know you better.

28:58.387 --> 29:01.355
It's worth
missing a couple of deadlines.

29:02.892 --> 29:04.858
I'm glad you want
to get to know me better.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.029
Thank you for coming with me.

29:15.955 --> 29:17.037
I'm sorry.

29:18.374 --> 29:19.456
I want to, but...

But, nova, I-I've come
to care about you a lot.

29:30.302 --> 29:33.053

29:33.139 --> 29:35.589
You are a beautiful
strong sister.

29:36.225 --> 29:37.307
But?

29:38.310 --> 29:40.677
But you are
in a vulnerable place.

29:40.763 --> 29:41.962
You just went
through something seismic

29:43.766 --> 29:44.765
This...

Can wait a minute.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.937
So that we can be
on steady ground for it.

I have some news too.

39:22.010 --> 39:23.343
About what?

39:24.096 --> 39:25.478
I got an apartment for us.

39:26.431 --> 39:28.715
It's in a really nice
part of the city

39:28.817 --> 39:30.883
and the rent is reasonable.

39:30.986 --> 39:33.520
It could be
like a fresh start.

39:35.357 --> 39:37.107
I still need a little
more time with that.

39:39.528 --> 39:40.660
Ralph angel,

39:42.831 --> 39:44.197
I love you,

39:45.650 --> 39:49.719
but we have to accept
that this might be happening.

39:51.957 --> 39:54.374
Even though it's incredibly
difficult to think about it,

39:54.459 --> 39:57.377
you can't just hide from it,

39:58.630 --> 39:59.846
or wish it away.

40:01.216 --> 40:02.382
I have a baby on the way.

40:04.052 --> 40:05.719
We have to think about her

40:06.304 --> 40:07.887
and her future.

40:07.973 --> 40:10.140
Yeah, I know.

40:10.225 --> 40:12.025
I don't want you worrying
about all that.

40:13.478 --> 40:15.145
I promised that
I'd take care of you.

40:15.230 --> 40:16.062
Right?

40:16.732 --> 40:17.647
How?

40:18.567 --> 40:19.566
I'll get a job.

40:20.869 --> 40:22.652
Go back
to the nursing home. I'll...

40:23.572 --> 40:25.071
I'll make honest living.

40:28.744 --> 40:29.826
That's my word.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.162
We 'gon be all right.

40:32.764 --> 40:33.696
Okay?

40:34.883 --> 40:36.032
Okay.
