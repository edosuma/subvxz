01:24.272 --> 01:25.638
- Anna.

01:25.639 --> 01:27.747
Anna, can you hear me?

01:27.748 --> 01:29.594
I need your help.

01:29.595 --> 01:31.555
I don't know what's wrong with me.

01:31.556 --> 01:33.460
It's so weird, I've got this weird feeling

01:33.461 --> 01:36.149
like everything's moving so fast,

01:36.150 --> 01:37.988
and I'm not in my body.

01:37.989 --> 01:39.510
It's so weird, I can't explain it,

01:39.511 --> 01:43.280
Anna, it's like I'm not
in my body, it's so,

01:43.281 --> 01:46.082
I feel like
something's really wrong with me.

01:46.083 --> 01:47.416
I can't explain.

01:49.690 --> 01:53.190
No, Anna, my heart, I can't really breath.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.457
Come now, Anna, please.

04:35.794 --> 04:36.794
- Hi.

04:37.863 --> 04:39.658
- I was having an anxiety attack,

04:39.659 --> 04:41.492
but I feel better now.

04:42.424 --> 04:45.757
- Clare, it's gonna get better, it will.

04:47.989 --> 04:49.789
I could just stay here for a little bit,

04:49.790 --> 04:51.957
and be here for you, okay?

04:52.881 --> 04:53.881
Okay?

04:54.972 --> 04:55.972
- Okay.

05:06.682 --> 05:07.849
- Clare, this is Jacob!

05:07.850 --> 05:09.435
I am trying to reach Anna,

05:09.436 --> 05:10.939
something terrible has happened,

05:10.940 --> 05:13.400
I can't get in touch with
her, she disappeared!

05:13.401 --> 05:16.314
- Mommy, get me out the car!

05:29.400 --> 05:31.968
- Clare, it's Jacob.

05:49.324 --> 05:50.741
- Are you asleep?

06:04.677 --> 06:06.510
- I'm sleeping, Clare.

07:00.301 --> 07:02.551
- I got it Clare, I got it.

07:04.608 --> 07:08.100
Jacob, please stop yelling at me.

07:08.101 --> 07:09.851
No, tomorrow, please.

07:22.715 --> 07:24.687
- I'm trying to be
available for a solution

07:24.688 --> 07:27.021
to be loving and supportive,

07:28.072 --> 07:30.731
and keep going, you know,
be grateful for what I have,

07:30.732 --> 07:34.554
and not just focus on what I've lost.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.124
I want to hear from you guys.

07:36.125 --> 07:39.375
- I'm too scared to get pregnant again.

07:40.740 --> 07:44.823
After two miscarriages,
I don't know if I want to.

07:46.149 --> 07:47.149
- Thank you.

07:48.099 --> 07:49.349
Joe, somethin'?

07:51.016 --> 07:53.349
- Yeah, I had a shitty week.

07:54.339 --> 07:56.406
I started my period.

07:56.407 --> 08:00.222
Spent that morning on the bathroom floor

08:00.223 --> 08:02.385
cursing my husband.

08:02.386 --> 08:05.303
And then, you know, cursing myself.

08:06.681 --> 08:09.764
And then at work, one of my coworkers

08:11.576 --> 08:15.499
found out she's pregnant with her third.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.417
An accident, of course.

08:21.472 --> 08:23.222
And I was just angry.

08:24.794 --> 08:25.794
I am...

08:27.401 --> 08:29.234
Angry all of the time.

08:30.339 --> 08:32.299
- My wife's not working,

08:32.301 --> 08:36.467
I'm doing these long hours,

08:37.321 --> 08:39.571
and the doctor said that...

08:48.940 --> 08:51.273
That she can't have a kid...

08:53.788 --> 08:55.342
Anymore.

08:55.343 --> 08:57.275
I just want to express to the whole group

08:57.276 --> 09:00.026
and people that I'm really angry.

09:03.695 --> 09:06.945
- I lost my baby about nine months ago.

09:07.939 --> 09:10.639
He had a really bad infection,

09:10.640 --> 09:13.890
and it just spread throughout his body,

09:15.175 --> 09:16.451
and he couldn't fight it.

09:16.452 --> 09:18.033
We kept thinking he would fight it.

09:18.034 --> 09:20.865
We kept hoping he would fight it,

09:20.866 --> 09:21.866
And...

09:25.244 --> 09:26.244
He couldn't.

09:27.321 --> 09:30.690
So, we took him off life
support after 11 days,

09:30.691 --> 09:33.608
so he lived, for 11 days, he lived.

09:35.635 --> 09:37.802
And then, we took him off,

09:38.672 --> 09:42.839
and then when he went off he
like put his little hands up,

09:43.853 --> 09:46.682
and his hands went like this, you know,

09:46.683 --> 09:48.548
they went in like this little position

09:48.549 --> 09:52.234
like he had found some kind of peace.

09:52.235 --> 09:53.671
And it was weird because it was like

09:53.672 --> 09:57.589
we all found some weird
piece when he did that.

09:58.668 --> 10:02.395
It was like he got to be free of the pain

10:02.396 --> 10:04.313
of this world, somehow.

10:05.185 --> 10:08.052
And I think we did the best thing for him

10:08.053 --> 10:10.470
because he just seemed happy.

10:13.356 --> 10:15.443
Then in the room, which just felt like

10:15.444 --> 10:17.290
there was something else there, you know,

10:17.291 --> 10:20.635
something really beautiful and bright.

10:21.508 --> 10:23.987
But I just don't know why
he had to go through it.

10:23.988 --> 10:27.846
I didn't know why he had
to have so much pain.

11:13.275 --> 11:15.549
- I felt like I should have a child

11:15.550 --> 11:19.924
because everybody was having
children at that time,

11:19.925 --> 11:23.794
and I didn't really feel this
huge calling to have a child,

11:23.795 --> 11:26.295
but I guess I went to college,

11:27.327 --> 11:30.159
I started my business, and I guess,

11:30.160 --> 11:33.283
the next thing to do was to have a child,

11:33.284 --> 11:35.201
so I had a child and...

11:36.220 --> 11:40.387
I didn't feel this deep connection
to him when he was born.

11:43.595 --> 11:45.345
I loved him, but I...

11:46.919 --> 11:50.919
I didn't feel this deep
overwhelming connection.

11:52.548 --> 11:56.322
He was a difficult baby, he was colicky,

11:56.323 --> 12:00.490
and I would have to stay up
with him night after night...

12:03.437 --> 12:04.854
Sleep well, baby.

12:12.623 --> 12:15.290
Shh, shh, shh, shh, go to sleep.

13:34.339 --> 13:35.628
- Do we have to? Please.

13:35.629 --> 13:37.560
I really don't want to.
- Clare, Clare.

13:37.561 --> 13:39.428
- Anna, you come with me.
- This is my best friend.

13:39.429 --> 13:43.501
- I can't believe you're
making me do this, Michael.

13:43.502 --> 13:45.835
- Clare, just an hour, okay?

13:46.873 --> 13:47.873
Hey guys.

13:48.785 --> 13:49.704
Hey, beautiful.

13:49.705 --> 13:50.719
- Nice to see you!

13:50.720 --> 13:51.594
Thank you for coming.

13:51.595 --> 13:52.728
- Thank you, thank you.

13:52.729 --> 13:55.018
I should of taken, maybe
I should take my Ativan.

13:55.019 --> 13:58.339
Oh my God, I'm starting
to see like little weird,

13:58.340 --> 14:01.529
like refracted light in
the corners of my eyes.

14:01.530 --> 14:03.696
- Just breath, breath, alright.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.754
- Ann, I can't see properly.

14:07.755 --> 14:10.447
There's something wrong with my eye.

14:10.448 --> 14:13.282
In my eye, there's some kind
of weird thing happening,

14:13.283 --> 14:15.554
I can't explain, Anna.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.358
Oh my God, it feels really weird.

14:17.359 --> 14:20.365
Can you get me my meds?
- Okay, okay, okay.

14:20.366 --> 14:22.356
- Okay, but don't be long.

14:22.357 --> 14:23.357
Oh my God.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.430
I'm just scared, I'm gonna duck down,

14:28.431 --> 14:32.547
I'm gonna duck down so no one can see me.

14:32.548 --> 14:33.548
Hmm.

14:34.531 --> 14:36.948
I can do this, I can do this.

14:38.539 --> 14:41.095
Alright, I can do this, I can do this,

14:41.096 --> 14:44.339
I can do this for Michael, I
can do this, I can do this.

14:44.340 --> 14:45.565
We're having to meditate,

14:45.566 --> 14:47.149
I'm gonna meditate.

15:14.816 --> 15:17.925
- Here, get up, I have your
purse, is this what you want?

15:17.926 --> 15:20.910
- My God you took so long,
oh my God, thank you.

15:20.911 --> 15:22.747
I don't wanna take these.

15:22.748 --> 15:24.953
- Okay, just get up, let's
go get some food, okay.

15:24.954 --> 15:26.105
Just get up.

15:26.106 --> 15:28.447
- You're gonna make me throw
up on an empty stomach.

15:28.448 --> 15:29.865
- Can I have one?

15:34.924 --> 15:39.505
- Sorry Anna, I
just wanna escape here.

15:39.506 --> 15:40.634
- Clare?

15:40.635 --> 15:42.324
- Just pretend you don't see them.

15:42.325 --> 15:43.208
- Clare.

15:43.209 --> 15:44.977
- Put this is your purse.

15:44.978 --> 15:45.932
- Okay, you know what?

15:45.933 --> 15:48.919
Yeah, let's go over, let's go over,

15:48.920 --> 15:50.072
I'll take my drink.

15:50.073 --> 15:51.671
Yeah, hi!

15:51.672 --> 15:53.928
- Hi! Thank
you so much for coming.

15:53.929 --> 15:55.012
- Hi!

15:56.045 --> 15:57.280
- Hey Clare, how are you doin'?

15:57.281 --> 15:58.212
- How are you?

15:58.213 --> 15:59.236
- Good to see you.

15:59.237 --> 16:00.464
- Good to see you.

16:00.465 --> 16:01.792
- Clare's sister, Anna.

16:01.793 --> 16:03.493
- Hey! How are you?

16:03.494 --> 16:04.504
- Good, thanks.

16:04.505 --> 16:05.532
- How's your little one?

16:05.533 --> 16:08.166
- Oh, he's not little
anymore, he's almost four.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.370
I'll be right back.

16:09.371 --> 16:10.972
- Where are you going?

16:10.973 --> 16:13.862
- God, time flies, she was such
a beautiful pregnant woman.

16:13.863 --> 16:15.325
She never gained an ounce,

16:15.326 --> 16:17.321
and I just feel fat.

16:17.322 --> 16:19.780
- That's so true, that's
what happens, right?

16:19.781 --> 16:22.213
Around the arms, that's
where it really shows.

16:22.214 --> 16:23.047
- Right.

16:23.048 --> 16:25.221
- It shows first in the
arms, and then yeah,

16:25.222 --> 16:27.878
I can see how like it's
already aging you a little bit.

16:27.879 --> 16:29.678
You know, it does do that, right, when...

16:29.679 --> 16:32.215
- Do you think you guys
will try for another baby?

16:32.216 --> 16:34.638
- I don't know, we never really have sex.

16:34.639 --> 16:35.472
What do you think?

16:35.473 --> 16:38.158
I, I, nah, it doesn't look
like it's in the cards really.

16:38.159 --> 16:41.159
He's always too tired, so, you know.

16:42.165 --> 16:44.225
But you know, how's it going with you?

16:44.226 --> 16:45.773
Do you have a good doctor?

16:45.774 --> 16:46.618
- Oh, yeah.

16:46.619 --> 16:48.968
- Yeah, we lucked out,
we got a really great...

16:48.969 --> 16:50.107
- Oh, you think so?

16:50.108 --> 16:52.098
Because mine was supposed
to be good, you know,

16:52.099 --> 16:53.978
everybody said he was
a really good doctor,

16:53.979 --> 16:56.904
he's like high ratings and everything.

16:56.905 --> 16:59.377
So, be careful, you can
never trust your doctor,

16:59.378 --> 17:00.884
okay, I'm just telling you...

17:00.885 --> 17:01.869
- We got somebody great.

17:01.870 --> 17:03.000
- Yeah, but you have to be careful.

17:03.001 --> 17:05.173
You have to be your own doctor, okay?

17:05.174 --> 17:07.837
So, things to really watch
out for is the water.

17:07.838 --> 17:10.555
Their pumping fluoride
into our water supply,

17:10.556 --> 17:11.948
and it's causing cancers,

17:11.949 --> 17:13.813
it's causing so many birth defects

17:13.814 --> 17:16.595
in especially pregnant women and babies,

17:16.596 --> 17:20.307
so I would just, don't drink
any, any water if you can.

17:20.308 --> 17:22.013
I recently saw a psychic,

17:22.015 --> 17:23.961
and the psychic told me,
you know, the psychic,

17:23.962 --> 17:24.903
she's not just a psychic,

17:24.904 --> 17:28.219
but she channels spirits and
she channels baby spirits

17:28.220 --> 17:30.096
and things like that,

17:30.097 --> 17:34.673
and she told me that the
reason my baby got an infection

17:34.674 --> 17:38.044
is because it was channeled
through the cellphone.

17:38.045 --> 17:40.137
So now, if your pregnant you're more,

17:40.138 --> 17:41.549
something about the rays,

17:41.550 --> 17:43.167
and the way you're more susceptible,

17:43.168 --> 17:44.750
if you talk on your cellphone you could be

17:44.751 --> 17:46.171
picking up all kinds of diseases,

17:46.172 --> 17:47.191
I'm not making this up.

17:47.192 --> 17:48.528
You could look it up on TedTalks.

17:48.529 --> 17:50.447
Go, do that, after your shower today,

17:50.448 --> 17:52.442
go look it up on TedTalks, okay?

17:52.443 --> 17:54.475
- Come on, let's go find Anna.

17:54.476 --> 17:56.363
- There are so many
things to be afraid of.

17:56.364 --> 18:00.676
What? Yeah, I'll go find
her, she's my sister.

18:00.677 --> 18:02.433
- I'm sorry.

18:02.434 --> 18:03.684
- Anna!

18:09.363 --> 18:10.363
Anna.

18:52.625 --> 18:53.625
- No, wait.

18:56.786 --> 18:57.786
Please.

19:01.106 --> 19:02.773
- Her name is Bella.

19:04.635 --> 19:09.254
I always wanted a little
girl, a little Bella.

19:09.255 --> 19:11.255
- I love the name Bella.

19:12.181 --> 19:13.181
Hi, Bella.

19:43.619 --> 19:44.619
- Clare.

19:45.883 --> 19:47.990
It's time to go.

19:47.991 --> 19:50.816
- Yeah, it'd probably be best.

19:50.817 --> 19:51.817
- Come on.

19:53.587 --> 19:54.586
Clare.

19:54.587 --> 19:56.505
- This must be very hard for you,

19:56.506 --> 19:58.506
but you should go, okay?

20:03.473 --> 20:05.723
- Come on, Clare.

20:11.988 --> 20:14.738
- We're gonna take Bella with us.

20:34.404 --> 20:37.457
This isn't really happening to me.

20:37.458 --> 20:39.125
This is a bad dream.

20:39.991 --> 20:40.991
A nightmare.

20:59.152 --> 21:02.408
- I'm so glad that both of
you were able to come in.

21:02.409 --> 21:05.600
I think we'll get a lot of
work resolved in this session.

21:05.601 --> 21:08.568
Anna, with hypnotherapy,
I can't make you do

21:08.569 --> 21:11.678
anything you don't wanna do.

21:11.679 --> 21:14.894
What we're trying to do is
we're trying to relax the brain

21:14.895 --> 21:18.227
from the alpha, to the beta,
down to the delta waves

21:18.228 --> 21:21.002
to access your subconscious
so that we can really

21:21.003 --> 21:24.322
get to a deep, deep, level of peace.

21:24.323 --> 21:26.576
What I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna count you down.

21:26.577 --> 21:29.378
We're gonna count down from one to ten,

21:29.379 --> 21:33.582
and I'm gonna ask you to please
close your eyes right now.

21:33.583 --> 21:37.250
And I'd like you to
take a nice deep breath.

21:38.193 --> 21:40.480
I'm gonna count you from one to ten.

21:40.481 --> 21:42.648
By the time we get to ten,

21:43.519 --> 21:46.023
you should be in a nice relaxed state.

21:46.024 --> 21:47.024
One.

21:48.682 --> 21:49.682
Two.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.134
Take in a nice deep breath.

21:52.135 --> 21:55.977
Let it fill all the way down to your toes.

21:55.978 --> 21:56.978
Three.

21:58.838 --> 21:59.838
Four.

22:00.585 --> 22:04.752
Take a nice deep breath that
fills your entire abdomen.

22:06.348 --> 22:07.348
Five.

22:08.936 --> 22:09.936
Six.

22:11.797 --> 22:12.797
Seven.

22:14.533 --> 22:17.085
You're fully supported.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.669
Your bodies and minds are safe.

22:24.146 --> 22:27.480
By remembering it, we
can release any trauma

22:27.481 --> 22:29.327
from our past and heal.

22:32.112 --> 22:33.606
Ten.

23:32.151 --> 23:33.151
Ten.

23:35.513 --> 23:36.513
Nine.

23:37.880 --> 23:38.880
Eight.

23:40.289 --> 23:41.289
Seven.

23:42.707 --> 23:43.707
Six.

23:44.732 --> 23:45.732
Five.

23:46.649 --> 23:47.649
Four.

23:48.674 --> 23:49.674
Three.

23:50.508 --> 23:54.675
Again, one last deep breath
all the way to your toes.

23:56.041 --> 23:57.041
Two.

23:57.773 --> 23:58.773
And one.

24:01.233 --> 24:04.118
Clare, how are you doing?

24:04.119 --> 24:06.317
- I think I feel better.

24:06.318 --> 24:07.422
- Good.

24:07.423 --> 24:09.134
Anna, what came forward for you?

24:09.135 --> 24:10.601
How are you doing?

24:10.602 --> 24:13.519
- I don't think that worked at all.

24:34.286 --> 24:37.408
- Well, well, well, if
it isn't Lopsy and Mopsy.

24:37.409 --> 24:38.576
- Dad.

24:40.380 --> 24:42.542
- Hey, Dad, no ones told us that

24:42.543 --> 24:44.757
since we were about 8.

24:44.758 --> 24:46.813
- I have to go to the bathroom.

24:46.814 --> 24:49.753
- You two were always
a handful to deal with.

24:49.754 --> 24:51.993
Haven't changed a bit.

24:51.994 --> 24:54.161
Always needed a good clop.

25:05.651 --> 25:06.651
- Mom.

25:08.103 --> 25:09.725
I miss you.

26:10.645 --> 26:11.478
- Amen.

26:11.478 --> 26:12.478
- Amen.

26:15.403 --> 26:16.403
Mom.

26:28.962 --> 26:29.800
- What's going on?

26:29.801 --> 26:31.835
You trying to burn the house down?

26:31.836 --> 26:32.836
- No, Dad.

26:34.341 --> 26:36.476
- I'll blow them out.

26:36.477 --> 26:39.283
Still lying to me like you
always use to, but I understand.

26:39.284 --> 26:42.630
You don't want dear ol' Dad
to know what's going on there?

26:42.631 --> 26:47.377
- Come on Clare, I've got
his prescription, let's go!

26:47.378 --> 26:48.378
- Bye Dad.

26:53.504 --> 26:55.170
I went to the doctor's office,

26:55.171 --> 26:58.517
and he basically put me right on bedrest.

26:58.518 --> 27:01.960
And he said that I have
to go into the hospital,

27:01.961 --> 27:03.481
and then I went into the hospital,

27:03.482 --> 27:06.281
and I was there for three weeks.

27:06.282 --> 27:08.372
They still kept telling me it was okay,

27:08.373 --> 27:10.691
and they kept saying,
"You're okay, you're okay,

27:10.692 --> 27:13.768
"you're okay, and the baby's okay."

27:13.769 --> 27:15.923
And then, one morning we just woke up,

27:15.924 --> 27:18.989
and his heart rate was going really fast.

27:18.990 --> 27:21.318
And now I just keep thinking
there's something wrong with me

27:21.319 --> 27:24.938
and I just go to doctor's all the time

27:24.939 --> 27:26.711
because I've got all these weird symptoms,

27:26.712 --> 27:30.119
like a lot of like physical pain,

27:30.120 --> 27:33.370
and they keep telling me that I'm fine.

27:35.593 --> 27:39.285
So, I don't really know who to trust now.

28:08.132 --> 28:10.834
- Thank you
for calling CHA Hospital.

28:10.835 --> 28:14.286

28:14.287 --> 28:17.795

28:17.796 --> 28:19.149
If this is an emergency,

28:19.150 --> 28:21.423
please hang up and dial again.

28:29.304 --> 28:31.976
- CHA Hospital,
how may I direct your call?

28:31.977 --> 28:34.873
- Could I please
have Jasper Coleman's room?

28:34.874 --> 28:36.601
- I'm sorry, but
unless you know the room number

28:36.602 --> 28:38.238
I can't put you through.

28:38.239 --> 28:40.743
- I just spoke to
someone, I'm his mother.

28:40.744 --> 28:42.065
Can you put me through?

28:42.066 --> 28:43.250
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

28:43.251 --> 28:45.634
We've been asked to block all
incoming calls to this room.

28:45.635 --> 28:48.905
- But please, I'm his mother!

29:23.464 --> 29:25.588
- We all come to this life to heal.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.136
Not just this life,

29:27.137 --> 29:29.874
but all of our other lives as well.

29:29.875 --> 29:33.542
Some souls, they only
come for a short time.

29:34.779 --> 29:37.677
Before you came to this life,

29:37.678 --> 29:41.595
you and he made an
agreement, a soul agreement.

29:43.138 --> 29:48.049
Your lessons together in
this life, they're done.

30:10.144 --> 30:14.311
♫ Oh everybody's hearts breaking now

30:16.114 --> 30:20.281
♫ And you feel the world is ending somehow

30:21.947 --> 30:26.114
♫ And you wonder how
we'll find our way out

30:27.437 --> 30:31.604
♫ Oh everybody's heart breaking now

30:44.530 --> 30:48.697
♫ Oh everybody's hearts breaking now

30:50.636 --> 30:54.803
♫ When the oceans and
the rivers turn brown

30:57.012 --> 30:58.365
- No condom, okay.

30:58.366 --> 30:59.356
- What?

30:59.357 --> 31:01.606
- I said no condom.

31:03.628 --> 31:05.132
- Are you crazy?

31:06.566 --> 31:09.149
♫ Breaking now

31:10.633 --> 31:13.216
♫ Breaking now

31:16.322 --> 31:17.168
What the fuck?

31:17.169 --> 31:19.751
What the hell's wrong with you?

31:21.056 --> 31:24.344
♫ And you walk through the fair

31:24.345 --> 31:27.928
♫ And you walk to the sign

31:32.419 --> 31:35.249
♫ But you don't know what's bad

31:35.250 --> 31:39.547
♫ And you hold onto too tight

31:39.548 --> 31:43.715
- Your lessons
together in this life are done.

32:06.531 --> 32:08.769
- Please make this stop.

32:08.770 --> 32:11.103
I'll do anything, I promise.

32:35.923 --> 32:37.471
- The other day I was with Jasper...

32:37.472 --> 32:40.972
- I don't wanna hear about Jasper.

32:44.754 --> 32:45.837
- God dammit.

32:46.814 --> 32:47.814
Fuck.

33:02.523 --> 33:04.356
Wow, that smells good.

33:09.307 --> 33:12.116
- I'm glad I
could cook for you guys.

33:12.117 --> 33:15.117
- You're not using any dairy, right?

33:18.550 --> 33:21.467
Michael, I thought we said no wine.

33:23.279 --> 33:25.709
We agreed, we don't
wanna fuck up the baby.

33:25.710 --> 33:29.371
- We don't have to drink, it's okay.

33:29.372 --> 33:30.372
- What baby?

33:33.007 --> 33:35.801
- We don't have to
drink if you don't want to.

33:35.802 --> 33:37.614
- I want wine, okay.

33:37.615 --> 33:38.615
Anna?

33:57.548 --> 33:59.091
- This looks disgusting.

33:59.092 --> 34:00.342
- Clare!

34:24.654 --> 34:25.656
- That's why we're here,

34:25.657 --> 34:27.422
that's why we keep coming, you know,

34:27.424 --> 34:31.353
to try and deal with the grief together.

34:31.355 --> 34:35.056
Trying to move past the shock of this,

34:35.056 --> 34:37.556
and the anger, and the denial.

34:39.094 --> 34:41.446
Right, the bargaining.

34:41.447 --> 34:42.831
All these stages that we're going through,

34:42.831 --> 34:46.588
we can go through them
together to get to acceptance,

34:46.589 --> 34:49.147
to have some hope to move on.

34:49.148 --> 34:52.315
That upward turn that we talked about.

34:54.406 --> 34:55.428
I'm glad we're here.

34:55.429 --> 34:56.806
Let's hear from Joe.

34:56.806 --> 34:57.807
How are you?

35:00.218 --> 35:03.385
- I asked him for a divorce this week.

35:05.073 --> 35:07.752
He said I was being silly.

35:07.753 --> 35:11.920
That we just needed to stop
the whole baby making thing,

35:14.359 --> 35:15.942
and go on vacation.

35:17.480 --> 35:18.480
Hawaii.

35:20.273 --> 35:22.440
And I just told him, "No,"

35:23.780 --> 35:27.780
that this is something
that I have to deal with.

35:29.305 --> 35:32.305
And I think I have to go this alone.

35:39.094 --> 35:41.638
- You're gonna love what's
in my goody box.

35:41.639 --> 35:42.722
- What is it?

35:51.474 --> 35:53.216
My pot candies.

35:54.936 --> 35:57.334
I got a pot lollipop that was too strong,

35:57.335 --> 36:01.502
so I cut them up into
little candies.

36:02.513 --> 36:05.536
Takes he edge off wherever I go.

36:05.537 --> 36:07.620
When I'm not at the bank.

36:08.844 --> 36:09.844
With Clare.

36:11.700 --> 36:14.461
It helps to take the edge off.

36:14.462 --> 36:15.629
It all floats.

36:16.895 --> 36:20.062
You'll see.

36:23.859 --> 36:27.776
- Hmm, this is good.

36:34.399 --> 36:37.476
So, is she always like this?

36:37.477 --> 36:38.894
- Yeah, you know.

36:41.064 --> 36:42.064
She's Clare.

36:44.638 --> 36:46.971
Always a little high strung.

37:09.041 --> 37:10.541
I love this movie.

37:13.823 --> 37:16.491
- I didn't really enjoy it anymore.

37:16.492 --> 37:19.916
It felt like this chore, this
drudgery I had to get through

37:19.917 --> 37:21.486
to make it to the next day.

37:21.487 --> 37:23.532
And then the next day was the same thing.

37:23.533 --> 37:26.616
Go to the park, bedtime, dinner time.

37:28.623 --> 37:31.250
The same thing everyday,

37:31.251 --> 37:35.427
and I should've...

37:35.428 --> 37:39.686
Realized he was this incredible
gift that I'm being given,

37:39.687 --> 37:40.770
but I didn't.

39:00.805 --> 39:01.723
- Hey.

39:01.724 --> 39:03.473
- Hi, did I wake you?

39:25.641 --> 39:26.641
I miss you.

39:28.778 --> 39:29.778
I miss us.

39:40.979 --> 39:42.979
- I'm just tired, Clare.

40:05.831 --> 40:07.581
I miss the old Clare.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.039
I miss the old us.

40:29.241 --> 40:31.324
Something's gotta change.

40:35.508 --> 40:37.591
Something's gotta change.

40:51.450 --> 40:52.617
I do love you.

41:19.224 --> 41:20.057
- Oh shit.

41:20.058 --> 41:22.140
- Anna, it's Jacob.

41:26.541 --> 41:28.316
- Hey, I was gonna call.

41:28.317 --> 41:30.896
- I've been trying to
reach you for three days.

41:30.897 --> 41:32.523
I need to talk to you now!

41:32.524 --> 41:34.193
- Jacob, not now.

41:34.194 --> 41:35.544
- What? Are you kidding me?

41:35.545 --> 41:36.378
Now is the time!

41:36.378 --> 41:37.294
- Jacob, please not now,

41:37.295 --> 41:39.404
I promise you I'm gonna
talk to you tomorrow.

41:39.405 --> 41:40.351
- I'm not waiting anymore, Anna.

41:40.352 --> 41:41.445
I wanna talk to you now.

41:41.446 --> 41:45.613
- Okay, just wait,
I'm gonna come out, okay.

41:50.946 --> 41:52.613
Clare, it's okay, I got it, okay.

41:55.673 --> 41:56.673
Jacob!

42:00.221 --> 42:02.046
Shh, do you have to do that?

42:02.047 --> 42:05.254
Please Jacob, I really,
it was an accident.

42:05.255 --> 42:07.255
I really didn't mean it.

42:10.636 --> 42:13.525
Jacob, please, you don't know!

42:13.526 --> 42:16.518
It's nonsense, don't you dare!

42:16.519 --> 42:17.769
Don't you dare!

42:19.138 --> 42:20.221
Jacob please!

42:21.424 --> 42:24.257
Anna.

42:55.599 --> 42:59.766
Anna, ever since you've been
here my anxiety is coming back.

43:11.362 --> 43:14.317
And something's wrong,
like I can barely breath.

43:14.318 --> 43:18.110
I'm having really bad heart palpitations.

43:18.111 --> 43:20.278
It's such a weird feeling.

43:22.143 --> 43:26.310
I'm sorry, Anna, I'm sorry,
but you have to leave.

43:37.803 --> 43:38.803
- Shit.

43:40.927 --> 43:44.844
I thought having you here
might mellow her out.

44:03.653 --> 44:05.472
- This has been
your third ultrasound,

44:05.473 --> 44:08.023
and we've come up with
nothing that's wrong with her.

44:08.024 --> 44:10.569
- But why am I having
so many weird symptoms,

44:10.570 --> 44:12.425
like I've had this weird pain that's been

44:12.426 --> 44:15.098
shooting up the side of my arm.

44:15.099 --> 44:17.708
It just feels like there's
something going on,

44:17.709 --> 44:19.097
and I know you're saying that I was fine,

44:19.098 --> 44:21.785
but you told me that I
was fine before, remember?

44:21.786 --> 44:25.302
I came into you and you
told me that I was okay.

44:25.303 --> 44:28.602
Yeah, and I told you that
I had a lot of pressure.

44:28.603 --> 44:30.871
So, why did you tell me
that I was okay then?

44:30.872 --> 44:32.027
- You were okay then.

44:32.028 --> 44:33.353
There are some things we can test for,

44:33.354 --> 44:35.375
and some things they
just happen in nature.

44:35.376 --> 44:37.842
- But remember, I should
have gotten that other test

44:37.843 --> 44:40.265
where, remember, you
took, they asked me to do

44:40.266 --> 44:42.481
that cervical exam, and then I declined.

44:42.482 --> 44:43.830
Maybe that was the thing,

44:43.831 --> 44:45.698
maybe that was the thing that did it.

44:45.699 --> 44:47.887
- Clare, you did nothing wrong.

44:47.888 --> 44:49.911
- But then I remember I had a lot of fear,

44:49.912 --> 44:51.242
I had a lot of fear,

44:51.243 --> 44:53.933
and I had a lot of negative
thoughts, you know.

44:53.934 --> 44:56.489
I kept thinking that maybe
something was gonna go wrong,

44:56.490 --> 44:59.041
and then I kept coming in to see you,

44:59.042 --> 45:00.814
but you told me I was okay, Doctor,

45:00.815 --> 45:02.864
and then maybe it was
something that you did,

45:02.865 --> 45:05.222
or you guys, or what about the hospital?

45:05.223 --> 45:07.055
- No, no, the
hospital checked everything.

45:07.056 --> 45:08.333
They ran the tests as they do...

45:08.334 --> 45:09.898
- But they weren't checking my blood.

45:09.899 --> 45:11.747
They weren't checking my urine.

45:11.748 --> 45:12.972
Maybe if they had done that,

45:12.973 --> 45:15.105
they would have found
that I had an infection.

45:15.106 --> 45:17.329
Maybe if they had given me antibiotics?

45:17.330 --> 45:21.271
Maybe something could've been different.

45:21.272 --> 45:24.398
- These things
happen in nature everyday.

45:24.399 --> 45:25.816
They just happen.

45:32.469 --> 45:33.977
- I wanted to wait and make sure

45:33.978 --> 45:36.762
everything was alright first,

45:36.763 --> 45:38.602
but I'm pregnant.

45:38.603 --> 45:40.051
I've gone to the doctors,

45:40.052 --> 45:41.725
and I've gotten checked out,

45:41.726 --> 45:45.394
and everything seems to be alright.

45:45.395 --> 45:49.562
- This is something to be
happy about, congratulations.

45:51.795 --> 45:54.926
- I'm happy now, I'm not in pain anymore.

45:54.927 --> 45:58.344
- A lot of change, a lot of change.

45:59.212 --> 46:03.129
That's great, well, we're
real excited for you.

46:06.856 --> 46:09.431
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

46:09.432 --> 46:10.884
- What?

46:10.885 --> 46:12.468
- How are you dear?

46:13.796 --> 46:15.379
How are you really?

46:17.818 --> 46:21.318
He wants me to tell you that he's alright.

46:22.807 --> 46:25.307
And that it wasn't your fault.

46:50.021 --> 46:53.854
- Can you give me CPA
Hospital of Los Angeles?

46:57.591 --> 47:00.758
Can you please connect me to room 305?

47:03.478 --> 47:04.728
He checked out?

47:49.966 --> 47:52.217
- Mommy, get me out of the car!

47:52.218 --> 47:55.045
- If I'm not here, they'll be better.

47:55.046 --> 47:56.743
I'm not fit.

47:56.744 --> 47:59.494
It's better if someone takes him.

48:00.415 --> 48:02.748
I know what I did was wrong.

48:36.949 --> 48:41.116
- Please, I never
pictured burying my baby.

48:42.945 --> 48:46.362
Please, I never pictured burying my baby.

49:32.226 --> 49:33.226
- Hi.

49:34.680 --> 49:36.465
- I don't want you here.

49:36.466 --> 49:37.967
- Jacob.

49:37.968 --> 49:39.576
This is my house too.

49:39.577 --> 49:41.511
- You're lucky I haven't
pressed charges, Anna.

49:41.512 --> 49:45.039
- Please, Jacob, I'm
sorry, I didn't think.

49:45.040 --> 49:48.444
- I don't wanna confuse Jasper.

49:48.445 --> 49:49.528
- Is he here?

49:51.632 --> 49:53.965
I was, I've been so worried.

49:56.530 --> 49:59.197
Can I just, he's alright, right?

50:00.853 --> 50:01.936
He's alright?

50:02.992 --> 50:05.060
- He's recovering, get it?

50:05.061 --> 50:08.061
You almost killed him, Anna, get it?

50:09.202 --> 50:12.274
- I didn't mean to, it was an accident.

50:12.275 --> 50:13.858
- I want you to go.

50:15.339 --> 50:17.472
- Please, I just wanna see him.

50:17.473 --> 50:19.327
Just for a minute, please.

50:19.328 --> 50:20.615
- I want you to go, Anna.

50:20.616 --> 50:24.530
- I just wanna tell him,
please, Jacob, please!

50:24.531 --> 50:26.249
Just for a minute!
- No!

50:26.250 --> 50:27.083
- Jacob!

50:27.083 --> 50:28.083
- Go!

50:58.225 --> 51:01.754
♫ Glorious thing

51:07.272 --> 51:08.272
- Clare.

51:10.081 --> 51:11.748
Jesus Christ, Clare.

51:15.741 --> 51:18.802
Jesus, Clare, what did you do to yourself?

51:18.803 --> 51:21.089
- I fell, I just fell.
- Clare.

51:21.090 --> 51:22.376
- It's okay, it's alright.

51:22.377 --> 51:23.851
- Baby, what
did you do to yourself?

51:23.852 --> 51:25.915
- I just, please, leave me alone.

51:25.916 --> 51:26.916
- Clare!

51:58.883 --> 52:03.050
I was there when they
turned the machines off too.

52:14.258 --> 52:16.341
- Please, please,

52:17.581 --> 52:18.581
speak to me.

52:21.449 --> 52:22.449
Please.

52:38.690 --> 52:41.379
Why did this happen to me?

52:41.380 --> 52:43.350
Why is this happening to me?

52:43.351 --> 52:45.676
What have I done wrong? I'm sorry.

52:45.677 --> 52:48.094
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

52:48.984 --> 52:53.307
I can't get out of here, it
feels so dark, I can't breathe.

52:53.308 --> 52:57.042
Please help me, what have I done wrong?

52:57.043 --> 52:58.094
I'm sorry.

52:58.095 --> 53:00.068
It's too dark.

53:00.069 --> 53:01.292
I'm sorry.

53:01.293 --> 53:03.126
It's my fault, please.

53:04.244 --> 53:05.214
Forgive me.

53:05.215 --> 53:06.898
I'm frightened.

53:06.899 --> 53:07.972
I'm sorry.

53:07.973 --> 53:09.373
I'm so tired.

53:09.374 --> 53:11.478
My mind, it hurts.

53:11.479 --> 53:12.604
It's too dark.

53:12.605 --> 53:13.518
I'm sorry.

53:13.518 --> 53:14.473
It's my fault.

53:14.473 --> 53:15.384
I can't see.

53:15.385 --> 53:16.508
It's my fault.

53:16.509 --> 53:17.475
I can't see.

53:17.475 --> 53:18.308
I can't take it anymore.

53:18.308 --> 53:19.141
I can't breath.

53:19.142 --> 53:20.704
My mind, it hurts.

53:20.705 --> 53:22.423
I can't get out of here.

53:22.424 --> 53:23.942
It feels so dark.

53:23.943 --> 53:25.443
Please forgive me.

53:27.170 --> 53:29.682
Must've been something I did.

53:29.683 --> 53:31.137
Whatever I've done.

53:31.138 --> 53:33.076
What did I do wrong?

53:33.077 --> 53:34.561
Why is this happening.

53:34.562 --> 53:37.471
- What did I do wrong?

53:37.472 --> 53:40.583
Why is this happening to me?

53:45.382 --> 53:47.947
- I'm so full of fear.

53:47.948 --> 53:50.137
- It's my fault.

54:44.428 --> 54:46.178
- Mom, it's me.

54:51.944 --> 54:52.944
I'm okay.

54:58.179 --> 55:01.679
It was supposed to be like this, remember?

56:44.882 --> 56:48.299
- I can't keep driving around in circles.

56:52.697 --> 56:55.011
I need to confess.

56:55.012 --> 56:56.929
I need to get him back.

57:11.819 --> 57:13.917
- Expect that
his savings would suffer.

57:13.918 --> 57:15.813
- That seems like robbery.

57:15.814 --> 57:18.614
They're just coming in and
taking money off people

57:18.615 --> 57:21.452
without any money in the bank.

57:21.453 --> 57:23.647
It's supposed to be secure, right?

57:23.648 --> 57:25.148
They just took it.

57:47.148 --> 57:49.155
- Dad, what happened? What did she say?

57:49.156 --> 57:51.758
- They want her to appear
in court, in court.

57:51.759 --> 57:54.661
The hand with the papers
said she was served,

57:54.662 --> 57:56.945
then she takes off like
you two always use to,

57:56.946 --> 57:59.325
never said a word to me.

57:59.326 --> 58:02.659
Clare, it's unforgivable, that poor kid.

58:03.735 --> 58:05.347
Of all things I've said or done,

58:05.348 --> 58:07.653
I'd never, would never in a million years

58:07.654 --> 58:09.916
do something like that.

58:09.917 --> 58:12.404
Its unforgivable, that poor child,

58:12.405 --> 58:14.395
I mean, you're accusing me
of things, I would never.

58:14.396 --> 58:15.229
- I know where she is.

58:15.230 --> 58:17.396
I'm gonna go look for her.

58:22.210 --> 58:23.210
Anna!

58:24.689 --> 58:25.817
Anna.

58:25.818 --> 58:27.485
Anna, open the door.

58:29.552 --> 58:31.429
Anna, what are you doing?

58:31.430 --> 58:33.339
Come on, Anna, you need to open the door.

58:33.340 --> 58:35.007
This is not helping.

58:45.249 --> 58:48.601
It's too hot.
- Just close the door.

58:48.602 --> 58:49.846
- I'm not gonna close the door...

58:49.847 --> 58:53.014
- Close the fuckin' door, Clare, okay!

58:55.602 --> 58:57.893
- Can we open the window?

58:57.894 --> 58:59.227
- Just be quiet.

59:05.802 --> 59:07.810
- What are you doing?

59:07.811 --> 59:09.695
- I wanna know what it
felt like to be him,

59:09.696 --> 59:11.779
I wanna know how he felt.

59:17.047 --> 59:18.143
Now, you can listen to me.

59:18.144 --> 59:20.819
No one ever has time for my life.

59:20.820 --> 59:22.469
Jasper was sick again,

59:22.470 --> 59:25.477
and Jacob's been in a pissy
mood since his dad died,

59:25.478 --> 59:28.232
you were missing in action.

59:28.233 --> 59:31.564
Another fucking day I couldn't stand.

59:31.565 --> 59:34.432
He's yelling, "Let me out the car, Mommy!

59:34.433 --> 59:35.772
"I wanna get out the car!"

59:35.773 --> 59:37.101
- Mommy, get me out the car!

59:37.102 --> 59:39.428
- Please, okay, stop screaming at me!

59:40.426 --> 59:42.177
I'm lost, Jasper, please
stop screaming at me.

59:42.178 --> 59:43.775
Mommy doesn't know where the hell I am.

59:44.727 --> 59:47.785
This stupid thing is not working anymore!

59:47.786 --> 59:50.786
This is the road we were driving on.

59:55.536 --> 59:59.113
Right here, I'm driving
and he's screaming.

01:00:00.084 --> 01:00:01.237
"I want to get out of the car!

01:00:01.238 --> 01:00:02.821
"Let me out of the car!"

01:00:02.822 --> 01:00:03.707
I'm losing my mind!

01:00:03.708 --> 01:00:05.682
"Jasper, please stop it, Mommy's lost!"

01:00:05.683 --> 01:00:06.516
- No!

01:00:06.517 --> 01:00:07.816
- Maybe he'll stop if I swerve.

01:00:09.061 --> 01:00:10.874
Please, okay, stop screaming at me!

01:00:10.875 --> 01:00:13.428
I pull up right here.

01:00:13.429 --> 01:00:16.361
"Jasper, please stop screaming at me.

01:00:16.362 --> 01:00:17.919
"Mommy is lost.

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:21.245
"I need you to stop screaming at me!"

01:00:21.246 --> 01:00:22.079
- No!

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:26.198
- Just stay here, scream
in the car, I've had it!

01:00:26.199 --> 01:00:27.158
Jasper!

01:00:27.158 --> 01:00:28.158
Jasper!

01:00:29.097 --> 01:00:31.605
Fine, go ahead and scream, scream!

01:00:31.606 --> 01:00:33.689
I'm gonna leave you here!

01:00:37.539 --> 01:00:38.706
I walked away.

01:00:39.977 --> 01:00:42.978
You should have seen his face.

01:00:42.979 --> 01:00:45.269
I just needed a minute.

01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:46.745
I walked to the corner,

01:00:46.746 --> 01:00:48.696
and then the next corner.

01:00:48.697 --> 01:00:50.853
I don't know how many blocks I walked,

01:00:50.854 --> 01:00:53.346
I don't know how long it was.

01:00:53.347 --> 01:00:56.248
Maybe half an hour, maybe more.

01:00:56.249 --> 01:00:59.999
I was calming down, I was calming down.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
It was hot.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.087
I left him, I left him right
here in the sun to bake.

01:02:02.047 --> 01:02:04.115
I didn't mean to,

01:02:04.116 --> 01:02:06.033
I just needed a minute.

01:02:08.415 --> 01:02:11.593
You'll tell them, you'll
tell them that I'll get help.

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:13.748
You'll tell them that I'll never do

01:02:13.749 --> 01:02:16.352
anything like that again, right?

01:02:16.353 --> 01:02:17.186
- Yeah.

01:02:17.187 --> 01:02:18.499
- You'll tell them, Clare!

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:22.064
- Yeah, it's gonna be alright, Anna.

01:02:22.065 --> 01:02:23.648
It's gonna be okay.

01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:06.591
- Dear friends, it
is with great love and sadness

01:03:06.592 --> 01:03:08.721
that we are writing to tell
you that little baby Charlie

01:03:08.722 --> 01:03:12.389
passed away in our arms
on Sunday afternoon.

01:03:14.914 --> 01:03:17.552
The E. Coli infection that
had been ravaging his system

01:03:17.553 --> 01:03:20.303
proved too powerful an adversary.

01:03:22.812 --> 01:03:24.985
Even if he had recovered
from the infection,

01:03:24.986 --> 01:03:26.456
the damage to his brain and organs

01:03:26.457 --> 01:03:28.024
would have put him into a vegetable state

01:03:28.025 --> 01:03:30.427
for the rest of his life.

01:03:30.428 --> 01:03:31.429
He was in great pain,

01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:33.930
and his suffering was visible.

01:03:36.027 --> 01:03:39.655
We decided as a family to
remove him from life support,

01:03:39.656 --> 01:03:43.906
and let him go peacefully
back to the spirit world.

01:03:43.907 --> 01:03:46.180
For the first time since his birth,

01:03:46.181 --> 01:03:48.199
we were able to hold him,

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.950
and took turns until he was gone.

01:03:54.033 --> 01:03:56.031
As parents, it was the most loving thing

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:57.790
we could do for him.

01:03:57.791 --> 01:03:59.994
After he took his last breath,

01:03:59.995 --> 01:04:04.054
a smile spread across his
face as if to thank us.

01:04:04.055 --> 01:04:05.472
It was beautiful.

01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:10.994
This has been an
incredibly difficult time.

01:04:10.995 --> 01:04:12.342
And we thank all of you who have helped

01:04:12.343 --> 01:04:14.838
even in the slightest way.

01:04:14.839 --> 01:04:16.065
We feel very blessed to be part of

01:04:16.066 --> 01:04:19.531

Please, Mommy.
