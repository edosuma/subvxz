00:10.377 --> 00:11.844
Hey, Potter!

00:11.878 --> 00:15.247
I scored us a buck! Half of it's for you!

00:15.282 --> 00:17.550
Don't come any closer, Jed.

00:17.617 --> 00:19.719
Jenny's got it... The Red Flu.

00:19.753 --> 00:23.189
Stumbled over a dead body by canyon creek.

00:23.223 --> 00:24.890
She didn't see the "X."

00:27.594 --> 00:29.528
I'm not gonna let you starve!

00:31.932 --> 00:33.966
I'm leaving you the buck!

00:55.555 --> 00:57.289
Grandpa, what'd you get?

00:57.324 --> 00:59.892
Game was a little scarce today, kiddo.

00:59.926 --> 01:03.062
Plainview is a full day's hike,
but a total score.

01:03.096 --> 01:04.330
Fully stocked and completely deserted.

01:04.364 --> 01:05.765
Oh, I love these!

01:05.799 --> 01:08.000
Let's put everything away in the pantry.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.503
Perishables in front, canned goods in back.

01:10.537 --> 01:12.138
And those are for breakfast.

01:13.673 --> 01:16.008
You shouldn't be going so
far out there by yourself.

01:16.042 --> 01:18.377
I think I saw an electronics store there.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.880
I could go back tomorrow and
get you that part you need.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.116
- What is it, a vacuum tube?
- You're not going.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.452
It's our only chance of
getting ahold of Tom.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.522
He's your son.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.290
If anyone can survive, it's him.

01:37.697 --> 01:41.400
It's a capacitor, not a vacuum tube.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.469
And bring a weapon.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.538
Yes, sir.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.655
The ceremony will be at 0900.

02:02.722 --> 02:07.159
We'll have seven gunners and
the ensigns at half-mast.

02:07.194 --> 02:09.428
It'll be a hero's farewell.

02:11.498 --> 02:13.566
He wanted to redeem himself.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.869
He never had to.

02:16.903 --> 02:19.972
He gave his life for mine.

02:20.006 --> 02:24.176
He gave his life for the mission.

02:24.211 --> 02:26.879
And now we're free...

02:26.913 --> 02:28.314
To finish it.

02:32.886 --> 02:36.021
Congratulations, little guy.
Your job here's done.

02:36.056 --> 02:39.158
I could actually do
with some help with these boxes.

02:39.192 --> 02:41.760
You can set them up over there. Thank you.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.762
At your service.

02:43.797 --> 02:46.632
Little more room between those cots,
please.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.170
So, uh... the peeps are asking.

02:51.204 --> 02:52.504
What's this whole

02:52.539 --> 02:54.907
Human guinea pig thing gonna look like?

02:54.941 --> 02:57.276
I mean, basically,
you infect the crew with the virus,

02:57.310 --> 02:59.211
you see what happens?

02:59.246 --> 03:01.146
Well, not the entire crew.

03:01.214 --> 03:05.150
Six individuals of varying
blood and genetic markers.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.686
First we administer the vaccine prototype,

03:07.721 --> 03:10.656
then we inject each of them with the virus.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.829
Ah, gotta tell you...

03:16.863 --> 03:19.398
I don't know if people are
gonna be lining up for that.

03:22.602 --> 03:24.703
Well, that's not my department.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.511
This is the last one we recorded.

03:33.947 --> 03:37.883
Hello? Is anyone listening?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.852
My name is Dominic.

03:39.886 --> 03:43.689
We're stranded on a boat
west of the island of jamaic.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.925
There are 50 of us.

03:45.959 --> 03:49.028
Many are sick. We need help.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.931
- Turn it off.
- Anyone. Please.

03:55.101 --> 03:59.071
I thought I wanted to hear his voice again,

03:59.105 --> 04:00.472
but not like that.

04:05.011 --> 04:07.046
It must have been so hard

04:07.080 --> 04:09.148
listening to all of that suffering.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.219
Are you sure that you want to be there?

04:14.254 --> 04:16.255
To watch the trials?

04:18.591 --> 04:21.827
It'll be part of my blood
flowing through those people.

04:23.229 --> 04:25.864
I have to see if it's going to work.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.076
Ready...

04:37.110 --> 04:38.744
Aim...

04:38.778 --> 04:40.546
Fire!

04:40.580 --> 04:42.481
Ready...

04:42.515 --> 04:44.049
Aim...

04:44.084 --> 04:45.985
Fire!

04:48.655 --> 04:50.522
Fire!

05:05.171 --> 05:07.539
How are we gonna ask them to do this?

05:07.574 --> 05:09.274
We don't have the time or resources

05:09.309 --> 05:12.144
to recruit from anywhere else.
I know, but six people?

05:12.178 --> 05:14.313
She doesn't have the equipment
to sustain a quarantine

05:14.347 --> 05:15.848
for more than a few days,

05:15.882 --> 05:18.017
which is just enough time for one trial

05:18.051 --> 05:20.352
with as many people as
she can fit into that lab.

05:23.890 --> 05:25.858
Well, then I have to volunteer.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.161
We just risked everything
to save your sorry ass

05:29.195 --> 05:30.462
so that you could lead.

05:30.497 --> 05:33.332
What kind of message does that send?

05:33.366 --> 05:35.034
You got rank, you can sit it out?

05:35.068 --> 05:36.835
Everyone else can be the Guinea pigs?

05:36.870 --> 05:38.370
Captain's right.

05:38.438 --> 05:39.738
Someone from a leadership position

05:39.773 --> 05:42.508
needs to volunteer to set an example...

05:42.542 --> 05:46.178
Which is why I already had
Dr. Scott do a work-up on me.

05:46.212 --> 05:49.214
Apparently I check off a few
of the boxes she needs...

05:49.249 --> 05:51.083
African-American, male over 40...

05:51.117 --> 05:53.252
- Southern baptist.
- Master Chief.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.487
With all due respect, gentlemen,
it's already been done.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.322
And you don't even know if you qualify.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.924
The crew needs you,

05:58.958 --> 06:01.160
in some ways, more than either one of us.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.795
I appreciate the sentiment, sir,

06:02.829 --> 06:04.797
but you both know we're all needed.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.832
And we're all dispensable.

06:08.768 --> 06:11.203
All right,
spread the word we need volunteers.

06:11.237 --> 06:13.806
Let the crew know it'll be
completely confidential.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.008
I don't want anyone feeling pressured.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.010
Aye, sir.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.584
Told you God put me here for a reason.

06:25.618 --> 06:27.086
Maybe this is it.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.525
Let's just line 'em up over here.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.027
Thanks.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.261
Hello, captain.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.597
You seem to be settling in well.

06:38.631 --> 06:40.499
Well, I thought I'd make myself useful.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.034
How's Ava?

06:42.068 --> 06:44.336
She's doing okay. Thank you.

06:46.873 --> 06:49.208
I need two chairs around these tables

06:49.242 --> 06:50.876
and the medical questionnaires.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.612
I...

06:53.646 --> 06:55.881
I haven't had the opportunity to thank you

06:55.949 --> 06:57.616
for what you did for my family...

06:57.650 --> 06:59.952
After what I did to you.

06:59.986 --> 07:02.087
Commander Slattery said
you were very helpful

07:02.155 --> 07:04.389
while I was on vacation.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.925
Still...

07:06.960 --> 07:08.560
I don't deserve what you did.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.030
Let's finish what we started.

07:19.005 --> 07:21.039
Any history of serious injuries?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.975
No, sir. Never even broken a bone.

07:23.009 --> 07:26.345
Any flu-like symptoms? Aches or pains?

07:26.379 --> 07:28.647
Just aching to do my part.

07:37.323 --> 07:40.025
I never expected this many.

07:40.059 --> 07:42.961
Do you really think you
qualify to volunteer

07:42.996 --> 07:46.265
when you barely survived
dengue fever last week?

07:46.299 --> 07:48.267
You're not even gonna test my blood?

07:48.301 --> 07:50.035
Danny.

07:50.069 --> 07:51.570
Hey!

07:51.604 --> 07:54.273
I'm looking for the Copacabana.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.508
Anyone point me in the right direction?

08:03.016 --> 08:05.450
Harvest queen 2008?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.619
You never told me you were royalty.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.456
Dr. Scott says we might
be in there a few days,

08:11.491 --> 08:13.692
so we should grab anything important.

08:13.726 --> 08:17.296
I think she wants us to
have something sentimental

08:17.330 --> 08:18.964
in case it goes south.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.842
You're gonna introduce me to her one day.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.581
Thank you.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.217
For not trying to talk me out of this.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.686
Mm.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.340
So you've just received

09:01.374 --> 09:04.376
what we're calling the prototype decoy.

09:04.444 --> 09:07.713
It will, uh, bind to the
virus and keep it occupied

09:07.747 --> 09:10.349
while your system creates the antibodies

09:10.383 --> 09:12.551
that it needs to defeat it.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.853
I will remind you that
you will likely experience

09:14.887 --> 09:17.422
some side effects similar to
the early stages of the virus,

09:17.457 --> 09:23.328
so... some headaches and
fever and exhaustion.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.763
Just like a good hangover.

09:24.797 --> 09:26.598
Ladies and gentlemen, your entertainment

09:26.633 --> 09:28.066
for the next three days.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.906
Um...

09:34.974 --> 09:38.677
I would just like to say that...

09:38.711 --> 09:41.546
You are all...

09:41.581 --> 09:44.916
You're remarkable people.

09:44.951 --> 09:48.920
And...

09:48.955 --> 09:52.090
It is an honor to...

09:52.158 --> 09:53.425
It's an honor.

09:56.863 --> 09:59.131
Well, I'll see you in there.

12:20.270 --> 12:22.071
Stop right there!

12:22.105 --> 12:23.806
Stay where you are!

12:23.840 --> 12:27.009
I need Olympia. Please. Please.

12:27.043 --> 12:28.344
Help me.

12:28.378 --> 12:29.678
Don't come any closer.

12:29.713 --> 12:31.513
I need Olympia. Please help. Please.

12:31.581 --> 12:33.248
Stop right there.

12:33.283 --> 12:35.551
Please. I need Olympia.

12:35.618 --> 12:38.120
- Olympia can't help you.
- Please!

12:49.966 --> 12:51.400
Anyone in here?!

12:51.434 --> 12:54.570
Anyone in here?! Show yourself immediately!

12:57.640 --> 12:59.441
What the hell?!

12:59.476 --> 13:02.845
I thought you said this area was clear!

13:02.879 --> 13:05.280
It was. I don't know how the
hell she got through, man.

13:05.315 --> 13:08.217
Damn it, we need to tighten the perimeter.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.888
- Give me that.
- We'll check again.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.423
All right, you men, spread out!

13:14.457 --> 13:16.425
I'll meet you on the
other side of the street!

13:20.229 --> 13:24.232
♪ celebrate your leaving with a song ♪

13:26.669 --> 13:28.870
This one's for you, Bertrise.

13:28.938 --> 13:32.040

13:32.075 --> 13:35.377

13:42.285 --> 13:45.053
You know, I still remember the
first time you examined me.

13:45.088 --> 13:46.555
Well,
that might just be because it was only

13:46.589 --> 13:49.491
three weeks ago, and thankfully,

13:49.525 --> 13:51.426
you do not have Alzheimer's.

13:51.461 --> 13:53.362
Oh.  That's some good news.

13:58.768 --> 14:00.736
Family heirloom?

14:00.770 --> 14:03.105
Just something to keep my hands busy.

14:03.139 --> 14:04.673
Man of mystery.

14:04.741 --> 14:08.410
That's a conversation for another day.

14:08.444 --> 14:11.580
Over... What, Martinis, maybe?

14:11.614 --> 14:13.615
Let me guess.

14:13.649 --> 14:15.384
Shaken, not stirred.

14:15.418 --> 14:17.018
Precisely, Moneypenny.

14:22.792 --> 14:25.127
Oh, she hated that.

14:25.161 --> 14:27.229
You might actually
be getting under her skin.

14:27.263 --> 14:28.797
In a good way?

14:28.865 --> 14:30.732
Hard to tell.

14:30.767 --> 14:32.000
Yeah.

14:37.874 --> 14:41.143
Old e-mails... From my boyfriend.

14:41.177 --> 14:42.978
Mickey, right?

14:43.012 --> 14:46.148
That night at the vigil,
you talked about him.

14:46.182 --> 14:49.151
Were you together a long time?

14:49.185 --> 14:51.653
Uh, about a year...

14:51.721 --> 14:53.789
If you count all the time we were at sea.

14:53.823 --> 14:56.324
Systolic 120. All good.

14:56.359 --> 14:57.659
Thanks.

15:01.697 --> 15:03.498
I hope he treated you right.

15:07.170 --> 15:09.771
I, uh... I'm an only child,

15:09.839 --> 15:12.441
and my parents died on 9/11.

15:12.475 --> 15:14.943
He's kind of the only person who...

15:14.977 --> 15:16.578
Might even be missing me.

15:20.082 --> 15:22.851
It reminds me of when Sam was born.

15:22.885 --> 15:24.453
He was a preemie, right?

15:24.487 --> 15:26.521
Five weeks in the n.I.C.U.

15:26.556 --> 15:29.825
All I could do was stand there, helpless.

15:35.231 --> 15:37.332
Is that your daughter?

15:38.835 --> 15:40.635
Lily.

15:40.703 --> 15:42.404
It was her birthday last month.

15:42.438 --> 15:44.172
She'd be 11.

15:49.111 --> 15:50.445
Do you have children?

15:50.480 --> 15:51.913
No.

15:51.948 --> 15:55.283
I never quite found the
time for that somehow.

15:55.351 --> 15:58.153
Better not to have a child

15:58.187 --> 16:00.322
than to not be there when they need you.

16:02.358 --> 16:04.059
Well, if this all goes as it should,

16:04.126 --> 16:06.361
you'll be back with her in a week or so.

16:06.395 --> 16:09.331
Oh, we'll be back. No doubt about that.

16:11.167 --> 16:12.968
Uh-huh.

16:13.002 --> 16:14.469
Right.

16:14.537 --> 16:15.837
Thanks.

16:15.872 --> 16:18.740
So far, so good. That's the word.

16:20.209 --> 16:22.210
Can't believe this could really be it.

16:22.245 --> 16:24.513
Going home with a vaccine.

16:24.580 --> 16:26.681
Any idea what the plan would
be for mass production?

16:26.716 --> 16:29.251
- I heard talk about the C.D.C.
- Nah, it's too far inland.

16:29.285 --> 16:30.785
Captain's thinking Fort Detrick...

16:30.820 --> 16:32.454
U.S.A.M.R.I.I.D.

16:32.488 --> 16:34.456
The question is whether or
not they have any power.

16:34.490 --> 16:36.558
We could rig something
to siphon off from the...

16:36.592 --> 16:39.194
Hey. Let's not jinx this, okay?

16:39.228 --> 16:41.263
It's only been six hours.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.133
Yeah, come on.

16:49.639 --> 16:51.806
- How am I doing?
- You're fine.

16:51.841 --> 16:53.575
The fever's your body's way

16:53.643 --> 16:55.277
of working to adjust to the treatment.

16:57.680 --> 17:00.415
Hey. When Lily was a baby,

17:00.449 --> 17:04.986
her temperature would run 102
every time she got her shots.

17:13.429 --> 17:16.598
My throat's sore. Is yours?

17:16.665 --> 17:19.099
No.

17:19.135 --> 17:20.902
But I feel like I
can't lift my arm.

17:20.936 --> 17:22.237
I'm so tired.

17:22.271 --> 17:24.606
Everything all right, Master Chief?

17:24.640 --> 17:26.741
I'm fine, but...

17:26.776 --> 17:29.678
Commander Garnett looks like
she's burning up over here.

17:29.712 --> 17:30.979
You should spend a little more time

17:31.013 --> 17:32.280
in the engine room, Master Chief.

17:32.315 --> 17:34.115
Everyone's body reacts differently.

17:34.150 --> 17:35.917
It's as we predicted.

17:38.054 --> 17:39.588
Hey.

17:39.622 --> 17:41.189
Come on, doc.

17:41.223 --> 17:43.358
That is way below your pay grade.

17:43.392 --> 17:45.627
- I got that.
- Oh, no, Tex, that's really not necessary.

17:45.661 --> 17:47.662
Trust me, I can handle it.

17:47.697 --> 17:50.398
Hi. My name is Tex.
I'll be your server this evening.

17:50.433 --> 17:54.536
To start with, this fine cocktail of H2O

17:54.570 --> 17:58.440
served straight up for
your dining pleasure.

17:58.474 --> 18:00.208
- Master Chief.
- Thanks.

18:00.242 --> 18:01.509
What a gentleman.

18:01.544 --> 18:03.945
Hello.

18:04.013 --> 18:05.981
Never got a chance to tell ya.

18:06.048 --> 18:09.017
It was a nice eulogy for Cossetti.

18:09.051 --> 18:11.353
I don't want any more funerals, Mike.

18:14.557 --> 18:16.992
I think she's got everything in hand.

18:19.061 --> 18:20.528
You were right about her.

18:23.065 --> 18:24.866
How you doing there, sugar?

18:24.900 --> 18:26.267
Good.

18:26.335 --> 18:28.169
- Good.
- I'm okay.

18:29.839 --> 18:32.907
I'm seeing a future with the doc,

18:32.942 --> 18:35.710
even if it is just carrying her water.

18:40.449 --> 18:42.717
Hey, come on, girl.

18:42.785 --> 18:45.020
Kara. Kara. Kara.

18:45.054 --> 18:48.390
Doc! We got a problem!

18:48.457 --> 18:51.793
Kara. Kara! Kara! Kara!

18:51.827 --> 18:53.828
She's not responding.

18:55.264 --> 18:58.366
Resps 32, heart rate 120.
Kara, it's Rachel.

18:58.401 --> 19:00.869
Can you tell me how you're doing? Kara?

19:03.372 --> 19:05.473
All right, she's seizing.
Give me some room.

19:18.597 --> 19:21.099
Intramuscular valium in.
Give me fresh vitals.

19:21.099 --> 19:23.433
Seizure is at the 3-minute mark.

19:23.468 --> 19:26.670
She's febrile to 104.
How's that line coming, Doc?

19:26.704 --> 19:29.439
- I'm working on it.
- Work faster or give it I.M.

19:29.474 --> 19:31.275
- Valium's not working.
- I'm in.

19:31.309 --> 19:34.444
60 milligrams ketorolac, I.V. push.

19:34.479 --> 19:36.813
- 3 minutes, 30.
- Pulse ox is down 82%.

19:36.848 --> 19:39.149
We've got to lower her core temperature.
I need ice!

19:42.954 --> 19:45.322
Get me an N.G. tube.

19:47.325 --> 19:48.625
Approaching four minutes.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.235
I got the ice!

19:58.303 --> 20:00.704
Pour the water over the
ice and bring it here.

20:00.738 --> 20:03.106
All right.

20:31.436 --> 20:33.236
103.

20:36.741 --> 20:38.208
102 and dropping.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.348
Everything's all right.

20:44.382 --> 20:46.750
It was just the fever.

20:53.992 --> 20:58.295
Thank you, Bertrise.

20:58.329 --> 20:59.930
I'll show you how to decontaminate

20:59.964 --> 21:01.732
your clothes on the way out.

21:03.401 --> 21:06.837
A 104 degree fever can't
be from the prototype.

21:06.871 --> 21:08.372
So what does that mean? Is it the virus?

21:08.406 --> 21:11.074
It's possible we didn't
build a strong enough copy

21:11.109 --> 21:12.676
of Bertrise's receptors.

21:12.710 --> 21:13.910
The decoys could be breaking down.

21:13.978 --> 21:15.679
We checked it a dozen times.

21:15.713 --> 21:17.848
We must have missed something
in her medical history.

21:17.882 --> 21:19.916
Repeat C.B.C. and lytes on everyone.

21:19.984 --> 21:22.419
Add on L.F.Ts and endocrine panels.

21:22.453 --> 21:24.955
That should tell us more
than their blood work.

21:24.989 --> 21:26.957
He doesn't seem convinced.

21:26.991 --> 21:29.693
In fairness to Quincy,
he hasn't been here.

21:29.727 --> 21:31.928
Is there anything you can give the others

21:31.963 --> 21:33.764
to help reduce the symptoms?

21:33.798 --> 21:35.065
Quincy, give them

21:35.099 --> 21:36.900
80 micrograms of interferon.

21:36.934 --> 21:38.402
Right.

21:38.469 --> 21:40.904
That should pump up their immune systems...

21:40.938 --> 21:43.073
Just in case.

21:53.551 --> 21:57.387
Dude, you're exhausted.
Let's just call it right here.

21:57.455 --> 21:58.889
I can't.

21:58.956 --> 22:01.191
I can't.

22:04.429 --> 22:07.397
I don't know what I'll do
if anything happens to her.

22:16.340 --> 22:17.974
Open.

22:24.615 --> 22:26.750
He went in after her.

22:26.784 --> 22:28.018
What?

22:29.554 --> 22:30.987
My father.

22:32.690 --> 22:35.158
He was a firefighter.

22:35.193 --> 22:37.227
He went into the north tower.

22:37.261 --> 22:39.196
Jesus.

22:39.230 --> 22:41.331
You trying to cheer me up?

22:41.365 --> 22:44.301
Anyway...

22:44.335 --> 22:46.103
That's why I signed up for the Navy.

22:48.673 --> 22:50.340
Lieutenant Chung said you'd want to see

22:50.374 --> 22:52.375
the latest engineering report.

22:52.410 --> 22:53.977
What can I say, doc?

22:54.011 --> 22:56.513
I'm a workaholic.

22:58.983 --> 23:00.817
Ooh, my fingers.

23:00.885 --> 23:04.221
I can't feel...

23:04.255 --> 23:07.324
Rub your fingers together.
It will help the circulation.

23:14.165 --> 23:16.633
Tex, let's lift up your shirt.

23:18.536 --> 23:21.004
Garnett's lost blood flow to her fingers.

23:21.038 --> 23:23.039
She's hypotensive. I'll get the saline.

23:26.377 --> 23:27.677
This rash...

23:27.712 --> 23:30.313
You have any idea when it started?

23:30.348 --> 23:33.483
No.

23:33.518 --> 23:35.285
It doesn't itch.

23:37.722 --> 23:39.823
All right, well,
you let me know if that changes.

23:39.857 --> 23:41.658
Yeah.

23:41.692 --> 23:43.727
- See if you can get some rest.
- Okay.

23:55.273 --> 23:57.374
I think you need to
consider the possibility

23:57.408 --> 23:59.209
that the decoys aren't working.

24:01.145 --> 24:03.446
We've never seen the virus behave this way.

24:03.481 --> 24:04.714
But we haven't been in the field

24:04.749 --> 24:06.917
with the virus for a very long time.

24:06.951 --> 24:10.921
We can't know how the
symptoms might have evolved.

25:34.338 --> 25:37.274
- Master Chief.
- Baby, I've been strong.

25:37.308 --> 25:39.142
- I've tried to be strong.
- Master Chief, sit down.

25:39.210 --> 25:41.645
- I want to see my girls. Where are they?
- Get me a sedative.

25:41.679 --> 25:44.014
- Sarah, Annie, my girls...
- Russ!

25:44.048 --> 25:45.982
- I want to see my...
- Master Chief! Sedative!

25:46.017 --> 25:47.817
- I want to come with you now!
- Master Chief! Sedative!

25:47.852 --> 25:49.853
No, where are my girls?

25:49.887 --> 25:51.855
- Master Chief...
- Look at me, Russ.

25:51.889 --> 25:53.523
Look at me. You're hallucinating.

25:53.557 --> 25:55.191
- Where are my girls?
- Focus on me!

25:55.226 --> 25:56.626
- Master Chief, it's not real!
- Where are my girls?

25:56.661 --> 25:58.128
- It's me... Tom.
- It's not real, Master Chief!

25:58.195 --> 26:01.364
I want to see them. Annie, Sarah! My girls!

26:01.399 --> 26:03.199
It's all right, Master Chief.
It's all right.

26:03.234 --> 26:04.834
You're just dreaming.

26:04.869 --> 26:06.636
You're hallucinating.

26:06.671 --> 26:08.338
It's all right. It's all right.

26:08.372 --> 26:10.707
Holy shit, did you see that?

26:10.741 --> 26:13.243
Maya?

26:13.277 --> 26:14.511
Maya?

26:15.846 --> 26:19.149
Doc?! Hey, doc!

26:22.420 --> 26:24.988
No.

26:27.146 --> 26:28.977
Significant progress has been made

26:29.077 --> 26:30.576
in treating the Red Flu.

26:30.577 --> 26:33.431
If you feel any symptoms, come to Olympia.

26:33.531 --> 26:35.889
We can help. You are not alone.

26:35.889 --> 26:38.417
Significant progress has been
made in treating the Red Flu.

26:38.928 --> 26:40.162
Oh!

26:40.196 --> 26:41.430
Damn it.

26:45.235 --> 26:46.769
Do you think they really had a treatment?

26:46.803 --> 26:48.737
At Olympia?

26:48.772 --> 26:51.707
Remember when this whole thing started?

26:51.741 --> 26:54.309
People were hoarding apple cider vinegar.

26:54.377 --> 26:56.411
Then they told us to
rush to the hot springs

26:56.446 --> 26:58.580
'cause that's a sure-fire cure.

26:58.615 --> 27:02.885
And now it's Olympia, whatever that is.

27:05.288 --> 27:07.556
Somebody's got to be
making progress somewhere.

27:11.127 --> 27:13.862
It's not true what you said...

27:13.930 --> 27:15.430
That no one would miss you.

27:17.233 --> 27:18.767
I will.

27:36.286 --> 27:39.221
I'll make arrangements for the service.

27:40.356 --> 27:43.025
I want her given the Navy cross.

27:59.843 --> 28:01.910
So these aren't side
effects from the vaccine.

28:01.945 --> 28:04.079
- It is the virus. You're certain?
- Yes.

28:04.113 --> 28:05.547
No, he can't be.

28:05.582 --> 28:08.717
Maya died from a heart attack,

28:08.785 --> 28:11.420
- which is not a symptom of the virus.
- But liver failure is,

28:11.454 --> 28:13.455
and that's what caused her
blood pressure to drop.

28:13.523 --> 28:15.657
The fevers, the delirium, the hemorrhaging.

28:15.725 --> 28:17.359
There is no other explanation.

28:17.383 --> 28:19.357
There is one. We just
haven't found it yet.

28:19.457 --> 28:20.729
No... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:20.763 --> 28:22.397
What's your solution?

28:22.432 --> 28:24.499
I.V.I.G. passive immunization.

28:24.534 --> 28:26.335
- It could kill her.
- Kill who?

28:26.369 --> 28:28.270
Bertrise.

28:28.338 --> 28:31.306
He wants to use the plasma from her blood

28:31.341 --> 28:33.642
and inject it directly into the patients.

28:33.676 --> 28:36.378
- To give them her antibodies.
- No, Quincy!

28:36.412 --> 28:38.647
The amount of blood that we'd
need to take from Bertrise...

28:38.681 --> 28:40.649
I am not willing to risk her life!

28:40.683 --> 28:43.051
Well, I'm not gonna sit
here and watch them die.

28:45.788 --> 28:49.291
You are too important, Bertrise.

28:49.359 --> 28:51.226
And if it's not the virus
that's causing this,

28:51.261 --> 28:52.761
it won't make the slightest
bit of difference.

28:52.829 --> 28:54.730
But if it is the virus, we can save them.

28:54.764 --> 28:56.498
We can manage it.

28:59.869 --> 29:02.871
If there's a chance, we have to take it.

29:06.576 --> 29:09.678
I'm willing, Dr. Scott. I am.

29:14.083 --> 29:15.851
How are you feeling?

29:17.186 --> 29:19.354
Just a little tired.

29:20.356 --> 29:23.058
All right, take a sip of this.

29:28.932 --> 29:31.099
I've got Kara's test results.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.788
Captain.

29:57.460 --> 30:00.329
I wasn't sure it was my place to tell you,

30:00.363 --> 30:02.397
but if it were me,

30:02.465 --> 30:04.032
I'd want to know.

30:07.971 --> 30:09.237
Kara's pregnant.

30:18.448 --> 30:20.782
Hey.

30:20.817 --> 30:22.484
Hi, sweetheart.

30:24.787 --> 30:25.988
Danny?

30:30.893 --> 30:33.595
Captain said we could have a visit.

30:33.629 --> 30:36.131
That can't be good news.

30:40.970 --> 30:43.605
Don't you dare leave me.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.661
Brief the crew.

31:08.297 --> 31:11.967
Anyone who wants a visit, now's the time.

31:28.058 --> 31:30.393
Rachel?

31:36.266 --> 31:39.936
I just needed somewhere to clear my head.

31:41.772 --> 31:44.774
You were right.

31:44.808 --> 31:47.176
The I.V.I.G. hasn't worked.

31:47.211 --> 31:51.280
Their symptoms...
They're getting even worse.

31:53.050 --> 31:54.417
And Bertrise?

31:54.485 --> 31:57.220
Dr. Rios is pumping her
full of saline and F.F.P.

31:57.254 --> 31:58.488
She'll be all right.

32:03.460 --> 32:05.728
Who did I think I was...

32:07.898 --> 32:10.566
That I could solve this?

32:13.403 --> 32:14.804
You're the best there is.

32:18.742 --> 32:22.111
Yet I've failed.

32:22.145 --> 32:25.247
Come on. We'll find another way.

32:38.094 --> 32:41.296
God...

32:45.702 --> 32:48.937
Why did it work on you?

32:48.972 --> 32:50.739
We never should have let this happen.

32:50.774 --> 32:54.076
Wasn't anything anybody could
have done any differently.

32:54.110 --> 32:55.944
I'm here to see Kara.

32:59.549 --> 33:03.152
Six people, Mike. Six.

33:05.088 --> 33:06.989
Can you hear me, buddy?

33:08.825 --> 33:11.026
Can you hear us a-at all?

33:14.664 --> 33:18.534
Come on, Miller. We still need you, man.

33:27.010 --> 33:28.677
You, uh...

33:28.745 --> 33:30.279
You gotta stick around, ma'am.

33:32.482 --> 33:35.517
You know I can't be chief engineer.

33:37.587 --> 33:40.389
Cheng Chung? Come on.

35:00.770 --> 35:02.938
When they tell the story

35:02.972 --> 35:04.740
about the great plague of the 21st century,

35:04.774 --> 35:06.175
they'll talk about you.

35:08.311 --> 35:10.579
The six.

35:19.689 --> 35:22.558
Quincy!

35:25.929 --> 35:28.130
Microcellular inflammation,

35:28.164 --> 35:30.933
oxidative stress,
immune vascular dysfunction.

35:30.967 --> 35:33.602
And Bertrise...
always sick when she was a kid

35:33.636 --> 35:35.070
and yet immune to this.

35:35.104 --> 35:36.572
How could I have missed it?

35:36.606 --> 35:38.640
Can't say that I'm following you.

35:38.708 --> 35:40.976
What we're seeing is an
autoimmune response...

35:41.010 --> 35:44.246
The rashes, the liver failure,
the poor circulation.

35:44.280 --> 35:47.216
What happened to Maya was her
own body attacking itself.

35:47.283 --> 35:48.984
The virus is adapting.

35:49.018 --> 35:51.753
Once it attached to the decoy,
it changed shape.

35:51.788 --> 35:55.057
It exposed its human gene. Niels' gene.

35:55.091 --> 35:56.725
And that signaled to their immune systems

35:56.793 --> 35:58.560
to launch an attack on
every cell in their body.

35:58.628 --> 35:59.995
The monkey doesn't have any human genes,

36:00.029 --> 36:01.463
so it didn't have the same reaction.

36:01.497 --> 36:03.065
So how do you stop it?

36:03.099 --> 36:04.967
It need to modify the decoy
and hide Niels' gene.

36:05.034 --> 36:07.269
If our immune systems can't
see it, it won't react.

36:07.303 --> 36:09.771
No, no, no. There is no
way to get their bodies

36:09.806 --> 36:12.274
to manufacture the modified
decoy on their own.

36:12.342 --> 36:14.109
Yes, there is.

36:14.177 --> 36:17.512
We use the Arctic strain as a Trojan horse.

37:20.243 --> 37:23.211
You're gonna be okay, buddy.

37:23.279 --> 37:24.746
We got this.

37:49.577 --> 37:51.945
It didn't work, did it?

37:53.281 --> 37:54.814
Take a look.

38:17.772 --> 38:21.441
I was thinking it might be
high time for the samba.

38:21.509 --> 38:23.710
- Tex.
- The merengue?

38:23.744 --> 38:25.912
In bed. Now.

38:25.946 --> 38:27.213
Oh, I thought she'd never ask.

38:31.285 --> 38:33.620
Hey, And?

38:33.654 --> 38:35.088
Put that down, relax.

38:35.122 --> 38:37.257
No, sir.

38:44.298 --> 38:45.632
I told you.

38:45.666 --> 38:48.101
Yes, you did.

38:51.939 --> 38:53.940
Dr. Scott?

38:57.011 --> 38:58.278
The baby?

38:59.714 --> 39:01.047
Will be born immune.

39:09.623 --> 39:10.890
It was touch and go there for a while.

39:20.034 --> 39:22.202
Hey, how's it goin'?

39:37.585 --> 39:39.052
Can we talk...

39:41.822 --> 39:45.291
About what I hope...

39:45.326 --> 39:46.793
Is going on in there?

39:52.199 --> 39:53.466
We have it.

39:56.604 --> 39:59.139
We have a vaccine.

40:01.242 --> 40:04.811
We don't just have...

40:04.845 --> 40:07.046
A vaccine.

40:07.081 --> 40:09.783
We have...

40:09.817 --> 40:11.584
The cure.

40:16.390 --> 40:17.590
You mean...

40:19.460 --> 40:21.060
I mean that we can save people

40:21.095 --> 40:23.263
who are already sick.

40:46.120 --> 40:47.854
Grandpa, what do you think?

40:47.922 --> 40:49.656
Looking good, kiddo.

40:49.690 --> 40:52.058
Don't forget the "151" on the hull.

40:56.897 --> 40:59.132
Thank you.

40:59.166 --> 41:01.367
Mm! Mm!

41:03.504 --> 41:05.472
Uh... uh...

41:05.506 --> 41:06.840
Hey, eat.

41:06.874 --> 41:10.410
- This is W6ABH.
- Oh...

41:10.444 --> 41:13.146
This is Jed Chandler, Clearwater, Virginia.

41:13.180 --> 41:17.417
I'm listening on 14.441 kilohertz,

41:17.451 --> 41:20.753
looking for U.S.S. Nathan James.

41:20.821 --> 41:23.223
Captain Tom Chandler...

41:23.257 --> 41:27.260
If you're still there, please respond.
Over.

41:27.294 --> 41:30.897
Looking for U.S.S. Nathan James.

41:32.333 --> 41:34.400
Captain Tom Chandler.

41:34.435 --> 41:38.104
If you're still out there, please respond.
