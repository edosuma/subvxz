00:04.099 --> 00:05.699
You know what I was watching
the other night?

00:05.700 --> 00:07.200
- What?
- Happy days.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.834
And something ocurred to me.

00:08.869 --> 00:10.803
I think Fonzie
may have been a mutant.

00:10.837 --> 00:14.006
- How so?
- I mean, how not?

00:14.041 --> 00:18.044
He's got power over women
like a Svengali, right?

00:18.078 --> 00:19.612
All right.
A lot of guys have that.

00:19.646 --> 00:21.547
Okay.
He beat an alien.

00:21.581 --> 00:23.983
He was the only human being
to best mork.

00:24.017 --> 00:25.184
Okay.

00:25.218 --> 00:27.319
I've seen Robin Williams
and mork, not that hard.

00:27.354 --> 00:29.004
And when's the last time
you banged on a jukebox

00:29.056 --> 00:30.423
And made it play?

00:30.457 --> 00:31.924
- Uh, I mean--
- Or a girl?

00:31.958 --> 00:33.259
[laughter]

00:33.293 --> 00:35.394
If somebody came up
and told you you could be Fonzie

00:35.429 --> 00:37.229
When you were a little kid, how
awesome would that have been?

00:37.247 --> 00:38.614
You're going to grow up
to be Fonzie.

00:38.665 --> 00:40.332
If they told me
I could be Fonzie now...

00:40.367 --> 00:42.301
[laughter]

00:45.338 --> 00:49.338

01:18.021 --> 01:20.990
Hello and welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,

01:21.024 --> 01:23.692
The only show that bases
all of its cereal choices

01:23.744 --> 01:24.994
On the mascots.

01:25.028 --> 01:26.545
I'm your host,
Kevin Smith.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.180
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:28.215 --> 01:30.116
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:30.150 --> 01:31.951
I told you before
about Anthony.

01:31.985 --> 01:34.353
He's become quite
a regular at the Stash,

01:34.387 --> 01:35.788
And we look forward to him
coming down because,

01:35.822 --> 01:38.090
I mean, this guy
has really cool stuff.

01:38.125 --> 01:39.942
This is the guy that
founded kryptonite rocks.

01:39.976 --> 01:41.994
Yes.

01:42.012 --> 01:43.362
Wow.

01:43.396 --> 01:44.830
This is pretty
darn impressive.

01:44.865 --> 01:48.167
So I give this dude an entry
into the store after that

01:48.201 --> 01:49.602
As much as he wants.

01:49.636 --> 01:51.604
- Anthony!
- Anthony!

01:51.638 --> 01:52.671
- How are you?
- What's up, man?

01:52.689 --> 01:53.906
- What's going on, ant?
- Welcome back.

01:53.924 --> 01:55.024
How you doing?
What's up?

01:55.058 --> 01:56.809
- Guys, here.
- What's this?

01:56.843 --> 01:58.043
It's, like,
a steak sandwich?

01:58.077 --> 01:59.345
That is a--
that's a smile right there.

01:59.379 --> 02:00.346
- Oh, there you go.
- Cheesesteak.

02:00.380 --> 02:01.564
All right.
You come bearing gifts.

02:01.598 --> 02:03.349
- Thank you. Oh!
- They're full, man.

02:03.383 --> 02:06.452
What else do you have for us?
You never come empty-handed.

02:06.486 --> 02:07.453
What do you got?

02:07.487 --> 02:09.020
I brought you
a little piece.

02:09.055 --> 02:12.691
Ooh.
Warner Brothers shadow box.

02:19.533 --> 02:20.933
Anthony, where do you
get this stuff, man?

02:20.967 --> 02:22.067
Every time
you come in here,

02:22.102 --> 02:24.670
You got something better
than the last time.

02:24.688 --> 02:25.838
I've been collecting
my whole life.

02:25.872 --> 02:27.673
I just have so much stuff.

02:27.707 --> 02:29.875
It's time to make
everybody happy.

02:29.909 --> 02:31.443
What does Anthony
need for a shadow box?

02:31.478 --> 02:33.813
Uh, I don't know.
Nickel?

02:33.847 --> 02:35.948
- 500, huh?
- That's the price.

02:35.982 --> 02:38.467
You know, last time he was in,
he brought his boys with him.

02:38.518 --> 02:41.220
His muscle.

02:41.254 --> 02:43.222
Hello.

02:43.256 --> 02:47.526
So I felt, you know, why not let
Ming get in on the negotiations?

02:47.561 --> 02:49.595
[laughter]

02:49.613 --> 02:53.165
So it's all on you, cuz.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.568
I mean,
this is a nice piece.

02:55.602 --> 02:59.238
I definitely remember it,
limited to 250 pieces.

02:59.272 --> 03:01.941
Yours got a--you know,
low number here. 33.

03:01.975 --> 03:03.942
I noticed one
of the feet down here--

03:03.960 --> 03:06.078
Not broken, but it moved over
a little bit.

03:06.112 --> 03:10.549
You know, that'll bring down
the price a little bit.

03:10.584 --> 03:12.685
Would you take
$250 for this?

03:12.719 --> 03:14.887
For what?
The whole thing?

03:14.921 --> 03:17.606
The whole thing.

03:17.657 --> 03:19.558
How about 400?

03:19.593 --> 03:24.563
- Uh, 275?
- How about 375?

03:24.597 --> 03:27.967
I can go up to 300,
and that's the highest.

03:28.001 --> 03:30.970
350.

03:34.440 --> 03:38.877
All right,
we can do 350.

03:38.895 --> 03:41.547
- Register is open.
- Take what you want.

03:41.581 --> 03:45.284
- What, do you need help?
- That's 350. Right on the nose.

03:45.318 --> 03:46.986
Did you feel
intimidated by Anthony

03:47.020 --> 03:48.554
During that whole process?

03:48.588 --> 03:50.956
I mean, he said--
you know, his implications--

03:50.991 --> 03:53.125
It's probably
just all talk.

03:53.159 --> 03:54.526
I was pretty cool.

03:54.561 --> 03:56.061
You don't sound
too certain, though.

03:56.096 --> 03:57.463
- "It's probably just all talk."
- Your voice is cracking now.

03:57.497 --> 03:59.231
Yeah, you're even scared
to talk about it now.

03:59.249 --> 04:01.116
He's not here.
You're safe.

04:01.167 --> 04:03.903
It would be so sad if Ming
died over a Batman shadow box.

04:03.937 --> 04:07.072
Ming, it wasn't worth it.
Oh, Ming, no.

04:07.107 --> 04:08.574
- You did the right thing, cuz.
- [stammering]

04:08.608 --> 04:11.944
I have a feeling
I did too.

04:11.962 --> 04:13.612
- Tell your boys I said hello.
- I will, definitely.

04:13.647 --> 04:14.763
- See you later, Ant.
- Take care, man.

04:14.798 --> 04:15.915
Thanks, fellas.

04:15.949 --> 04:18.050
I am impressed.
You did very, very well.

04:18.084 --> 04:21.887
Celebrate the fact that
you'll live to see another day.

04:21.922 --> 04:24.222
If there's anybody
in this entire world

04:24.240 --> 04:27.526
That I've celebrated comics
with, it's Walter Flanagan.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.696
Walter gave me my interest
in comic books to begin with.

04:30.730 --> 04:34.600
So for me to own a store,
it's a no-brainer for me

04:34.634 --> 04:36.602
To turn to Walt and be like,
"Please, please run it."

04:36.636 --> 04:38.153
And now it's coming up

04:38.204 --> 04:41.573
On walt's official
15th anniversary.

04:41.608 --> 04:43.409
So naturally, I had
to put something together.

04:43.443 --> 04:45.377
I want to do something
for him, so--

04:45.412 --> 04:46.511
- What do you have in mind?
- Something--

04:46.529 --> 04:48.397
- Pizza party.
- Pizza--

04:48.448 --> 04:49.848
- Something a little bigger
than that.

04:49.883 --> 04:52.651
Let's go down the list
of things he likes.

04:52.686 --> 04:55.187
- Um, it's a pretty short list.
- Pizza.

04:55.221 --> 04:56.939
- Pizza.
- Hockey.

04:56.990 --> 04:59.058
Hockey. What do you think
about hockey?

04:59.092 --> 05:01.860
- Go to a hockey game together?
- Maybe something bigger.

05:01.895 --> 05:03.495
Like, I know Kevin's
in tight with the NHL.

05:03.530 --> 05:05.464
Like, you know,
maybe he could help us out.

05:05.498 --> 05:06.832
Some vip passes.

05:06.866 --> 05:08.200
Signed Jersey.

05:08.234 --> 05:10.336
Think he'd like
a ride on a Zamboni?

05:10.370 --> 05:12.037
- What is he, eight?
- All right. Just an idea.

05:12.072 --> 05:14.423
Call Kevin.
I'm sure he has a ton of ideas.

05:14.474 --> 05:16.542
All right, I need
you guys behind me, though.

05:16.576 --> 05:18.711
I'm 100% with you,
conditionally.

05:18.745 --> 05:20.496
Wait, wait.
What's the condition?

05:20.530 --> 05:22.031
Well, if he gets mad
and hates it,

05:22.082 --> 05:24.216
Then I'm just going to say
I warned you against it.

05:24.250 --> 05:25.734
I'll say you guys
weren't even involved, then.

05:25.769 --> 05:29.154
- Deal.
- Good.

05:29.189 --> 05:31.623
- Oh, she's a beaut.
- No way.

05:31.658 --> 05:32.891
Didn't even know
that was there.

05:32.909 --> 05:36.495
This is an actual production
animation cel.

05:39.883 --> 05:40.983
Have you guys
ever wondered

05:41.017 --> 05:42.718
If you could take down
a super-villain?

05:42.753 --> 05:43.919
Does it have
to be a villain?

05:43.954 --> 05:46.021
All right,
any super-powered being.

05:46.056 --> 05:48.157
- Iceman.
- How you gonna take him down?

05:48.191 --> 05:50.459
You know, blowtorch,
flamethrower.

05:50.494 --> 05:52.161
- You're insane.
- I know.

05:52.195 --> 05:54.563
Like the greatest minds
in the world of superheroes

05:54.598 --> 05:56.265
Haven't figured out,
"Well, to take down Iceman,

05:56.299 --> 05:58.267
I guess I'll just
get a blowtorch."

05:58.268 --> 06:00.833
- [laughs]
- [sighs]

06:04.340 --> 06:06.242
Looking for a copy
of Giant-Size X-Men #1.

06:06.276 --> 06:08.344
Talk about timing.

06:08.378 --> 06:11.714
We had actually just got
this Giant-Size X-Men #1.

06:11.748 --> 06:13.082
We had won it
on online auction.

06:13.116 --> 06:14.216
Really didn't even
have a chance

06:14.250 --> 06:15.885
To even open it up yet
and inspect it.

06:15.919 --> 06:17.670
Everything you know
about the X-Men today

06:17.704 --> 06:20.055
Stems
from the giant-size annual.

06:20.090 --> 06:22.575
It's an evergreen.
It never goes down in price.

06:22.626 --> 06:24.360
It only ever goes up.

06:24.394 --> 06:27.179
The guy claims
it's a very fine minus.

06:27.214 --> 06:28.330
Let's see.

06:28.365 --> 06:32.001
Well...
Hmm, doesn't look bad.

06:39.042 --> 06:42.077
One of the biggest problems
with this book was the staples

06:42.112 --> 06:43.562
Always marred the cover.

06:43.597 --> 06:45.614
No way. You know
whose signature that is, right?

06:45.649 --> 06:47.383
That's Dave Cockrum's
signature.

06:47.417 --> 06:48.701
Whoa.

06:48.735 --> 06:50.920
Didn't even know that
was there. Holy mackerel.

06:50.954 --> 06:52.688
In the listing I won this from,
it did not even note

06:52.706 --> 06:54.857
That it was signed
by Dave Cockrum.

06:54.891 --> 06:57.927
Dave Cockrum was an artist
on the Giant-Size X-Men annual.

06:57.961 --> 06:59.829
So it's already added value.

06:59.863 --> 07:00.996
You open up that book,

07:01.031 --> 07:03.249
And suddenly,
it's like finding gold

07:03.283 --> 07:04.567
Within the pages.

07:04.601 --> 07:06.819
The price immediately
went up a couple bucks.

07:06.820 --> 07:08.120
[laughter]

07:08.205 --> 07:10.573
The dude's like, "rats."

07:10.607 --> 07:12.107
So...

07:12.142 --> 07:14.910
What are you looking to spend
on a Giant-Size X-Men #1?

07:14.945 --> 07:16.645
I was looking
to spend around $200.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.347
- 200?
- Yeah.

07:18.381 --> 07:20.349
So you don't want
a nice copy, then.

07:20.367 --> 07:21.817
You basically want
toilet paper.

07:21.851 --> 07:23.886
- No, not at all.
- I can't do it for that cheap.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.421
So what were you looking
for it?

07:25.455 --> 07:27.790
- We're looking to get 500.
- Oh.

07:27.824 --> 07:29.375
Yeah, 500 bucks.
Man.

07:29.409 --> 07:33.429
- Okay, well--
- I'm willing to go up to 280.

07:33.463 --> 07:35.097
It's a piece
of comics history.

07:35.131 --> 07:36.398
I agree.

07:36.416 --> 07:38.133
The highest right now
I could do honestly is 350.

07:38.168 --> 07:39.868
- I can't do it.
- Can't do it?

07:39.886 --> 07:40.970
Yeah.

07:41.004 --> 07:43.222
I gotta get something
for it and--

07:43.256 --> 07:45.040
- 350's something.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:45.058 --> 07:47.009
I meant more than
what I paid for it, so--

07:47.043 --> 07:48.377
You know,
this guy's tough.

07:48.395 --> 07:49.912
- He's very tough.
- He's--he's tough.

07:49.946 --> 07:51.747
And he's got that weasel smile
too, look at him.

07:51.765 --> 07:53.215
- Look at him.
- He's not a weasel.

07:53.249 --> 07:55.150
- He's not a weasel.
- [laughs]

07:55.185 --> 07:56.652
He knows he can
get the 500 for it.

07:56.686 --> 07:58.153
I know he can.

07:58.187 --> 07:59.738
Iyou know what?
You're buttering me up there.

07:59.773 --> 08:01.056
You see, you took it
as an insult.

08:01.074 --> 08:03.409
I like that.
I like that weasel smile.

08:03.443 --> 08:06.946
425, and it's yours.

08:06.997 --> 08:10.366
425.

08:13.169 --> 08:14.403
400 bucks.

08:14.437 --> 08:16.205
- Can't do it.
- Can't do it?

08:16.239 --> 08:18.107
Nah, I need to let it
get up there

08:18.141 --> 08:20.142
And get noticed by
the other customers who walk in

08:20.176 --> 08:23.345
Before I take the first offer
that comes in, you know?

08:23.380 --> 08:24.980
Don't be surprised
if I come back here

08:25.015 --> 08:26.315
And hopefully still see
that book on the wall,

08:26.349 --> 08:27.783
And maybe we'll talk again.

08:27.817 --> 08:29.234
Thank you so much, guys.

08:29.269 --> 08:31.320
All right.

08:31.354 --> 08:32.854
We can't just sell it
right away like that.

08:32.871 --> 08:34.523
I'm telling you,
put it on the wall,

08:34.541 --> 08:35.624
We'll get
what we're looking for.

08:35.659 --> 08:37.676
Guys like that
walk in here constantly.

08:37.711 --> 08:39.260
Someone will buy it
for what we want for it.

08:39.296 --> 08:42.331
Absolutely.

08:42.365 --> 08:43.765
You know
what I was wondering?

08:43.783 --> 08:46.769
What superhero
would you most hate to be?

08:46.770 --> 08:47.853
[sighs]

08:47.854 --> 08:49.188
The one you'd be like,
"I would rather

08:49.222 --> 08:51.807
Be a normal human being
than be this superhero."

08:51.841 --> 08:53.175
I'm going to go
with Aquaman.

08:53.193 --> 08:54.944
Lately in pop culture,

08:54.978 --> 08:56.829
Everybody's always going
after Aquaman. Why?

08:56.863 --> 08:59.481
- You can control fish.
- How's that going to help me?

08:59.516 --> 09:01.550
All the crimes
happen on land.

09:01.584 --> 09:02.818
What about you?

09:02.852 --> 09:04.153
I guess I wouldn't
want to be Robin.

09:04.187 --> 09:06.155
Second in command
all the time,

09:06.189 --> 09:07.573
Having to wear
the short shorts.

09:07.624 --> 09:09.024
Like Mike.

09:09.025 --> 09:11.250
[laughter]

09:15.966 --> 09:18.267
- Hey, how are you?
- What can we do for you today?

09:18.301 --> 09:22.037
I wonder if you're interested
in buying this particular piece.

09:22.072 --> 09:24.473
It's from
Ralph Bakshi's production

09:24.491 --> 09:28.293
Of Lord of the Rings
from 1978.

09:28.328 --> 09:31.313
It's an actual production
animation cel.

09:38.221 --> 09:40.673
Wow, look at that, man.
You know who that is?

09:40.707 --> 09:43.959
- Frodo, Gandalf.
- Oh, I thought that was Bryan.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.312
[laughter]

09:45.528 --> 09:47.196
Years
before Peter Jackson,

09:47.230 --> 09:48.797
There was
a Lord of the Rings feature.

09:48.832 --> 09:51.066
It was done
by the animator Ralph Bakshi,

09:51.101 --> 09:52.534
The guy
behind Fritz the Cat.

09:52.568 --> 09:54.770
He did a feature version,
which was kind of like

09:54.804 --> 09:57.823
One of the first
grown-up cartoons.

09:57.857 --> 09:59.575
Kind of violent.
There was war.

09:59.609 --> 10:01.710
It wasn't really
aimed directly at kids.

10:01.745 --> 10:03.846
And until Peter Jackson's stuff
came along,

10:03.880 --> 10:06.782
It was considered
the high watermark in its day.

10:06.816 --> 10:08.350
You're looking
to sell this, huh?

10:08.385 --> 10:10.002
- Yeah.
- Robert, come here.

10:10.036 --> 10:12.421
- Yeah?
- What do you think of this?

10:12.439 --> 10:15.591
- You remember that?
- Of course I remember that.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.092
It's nice,
in very nice condition.

10:17.110 --> 10:20.479
It's a piece of artwork
that's becoming obsolete,

10:20.513 --> 10:22.231
And I think
this one's worth more

10:22.265 --> 10:24.199
Because of the poses
of the characters--

10:24.234 --> 10:26.235
Eyes open,
looking forward,

10:26.269 --> 10:27.403
A lot of expression.

10:27.437 --> 10:28.704
How much is it worth?

10:28.738 --> 10:32.508
Retail, this market right now,
probably about 350.

10:32.542 --> 10:34.309
All right, what are
you wanting to get for it?

10:34.344 --> 10:39.681
Uh, how about 325?

10:39.716 --> 10:42.017
No,
I couldn't do that high.

10:42.052 --> 10:44.153
Um...

10:44.187 --> 10:45.871
200?

10:45.905 --> 10:49.458
That's probably
the best I can do. 200.

10:49.492 --> 10:52.127
- I've really got to get 300.
- You've got to get 300?

10:52.162 --> 10:53.495
Yeah.

10:53.530 --> 10:56.648
250.

10:56.683 --> 10:58.767
275.

11:02.655 --> 11:06.542
I can do 275.
You got a deal.

11:06.576 --> 11:07.976
- All right, thanks.
- Thank you.

11:08.011 --> 11:09.061
Ten years ago,
you'd be like,

11:09.095 --> 11:11.213
"I'd burn
an animation cel.

11:11.247 --> 11:12.765
It has no place here,"
but now you're like,

11:12.816 --> 11:15.484
"Eh, let's throw it up on
the wall and see what happens."

11:15.518 --> 11:18.520
Even as a geek,
you're growing.

11:18.555 --> 11:22.057
I need an epic comic book gift
for my boyfriend.

11:22.092 --> 11:23.292
No way.

11:23.326 --> 11:25.627
- Oh, my God, Ken Daneyko.
- [laughs]

11:27.115 --> 11:28.165
Do you guys
ever order anything

11:28.216 --> 11:29.467
Out of the back
of a comic book?

11:29.518 --> 11:30.951
- Oh, hell, yeah.
- X-ray specs?

11:30.952 --> 11:32.752
No, he gets the
X-ray specs.

11:32.753 --> 11:34.153
[laughter]

11:34.256 --> 11:36.090
The foot locker
full of toy soldiers?

11:36.124 --> 11:39.093
Yes! The, like,
100, 200 toy soldiers.

11:39.111 --> 11:41.095
- Yeah. You get 199.
- Yeah, I ordered those too.

11:41.129 --> 11:42.596
Now if you looked at them
in profile, yeah.

11:42.630 --> 11:43.848
It looked like
an army guy.

11:43.899 --> 11:45.349
Now if you flipped them
around to the other side,

11:45.400 --> 11:46.534
They were, like, this thin.

11:46.568 --> 11:48.202
- They were paper thin.
- Oh, are they?

11:48.236 --> 11:51.338
You tried to use the x-ray
specs on the army guys.

11:51.356 --> 11:53.040
Many a time
I went through a comic book,

11:53.075 --> 11:54.542
I always wanted
to order sea monkeys

11:54.576 --> 11:57.244
Because they made the ad
look so unbelievably fun.

11:57.279 --> 11:59.613
They have crowns.
There's a kingdom.

11:59.647 --> 12:01.515
Yes.
They were a sentient family.

12:01.550 --> 12:03.134
And they could look
at you and stuff,

12:03.168 --> 12:04.685
Interact with one another.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.170
- I had them.
- You bought sea monkeys?

12:06.204 --> 12:07.705
It was a tiny,
little aquarium

12:07.756 --> 12:10.324
That had, like,
these circles all over it,

12:10.358 --> 12:11.876
Which were
magnifying glasses.

12:11.910 --> 12:13.844
And I remember I had grown them,
and they were swimming around,

12:13.895 --> 12:16.030
And I accidentally
knocked it over onto the rug,

12:16.064 --> 12:17.431
And I was, like...

12:17.432 --> 12:18.932
[laughter]

12:19.067 --> 12:20.484
"I'm master
of this little world,

12:20.519 --> 12:21.836
But I ain't got time."

12:21.837 --> 12:23.558
[laughter]

12:33.100 --> 12:34.817
All righty.
Thank you so much.

12:34.851 --> 12:35.851
Bye, Ming.
Have a good day.

12:35.869 --> 12:37.803
See you later.
Have a nice day.

12:37.854 --> 12:38.955
"Bye, Ming"?

12:38.989 --> 12:40.606
Yeah, how does
she know your name?

12:40.657 --> 12:43.225
- She's in here a lot.
- Really?

12:43.259 --> 12:45.261
I've never seen her
in here before.

12:45.295 --> 12:46.829
Look how red-faced he is.

12:46.863 --> 12:48.364
I know. He's got himself
a little groupie.

12:48.382 --> 12:50.299
Yeah.
[laughter]

12:50.334 --> 12:51.834
She's not a groupie.
You got to be, like,

12:51.868 --> 12:54.036
A rock star or superhero
to get a groupie.

12:54.071 --> 12:56.589
- Superheroes have groupies?
- Sure.

12:56.623 --> 12:57.940
Spider-Man, Mary Jane.

12:57.975 --> 13:00.343
She could care less
about Spider-Man.

13:00.377 --> 13:02.345
She did kind of like him
in the movie, though.

13:02.379 --> 13:05.214
Remember that scene where
Spider-Man's hanging upside-down,

13:05.232 --> 13:07.400
And they do
that kiss upside-down,

13:07.434 --> 13:09.902
And she peels the mask?

13:09.936 --> 13:13.756
- Mm, like that.
- Give me one more.

13:13.790 --> 13:15.858
- Harley Quinn, Joker.
- Yup.

13:15.876 --> 13:17.192
In what way?

13:17.210 --> 13:19.195
When they first met,
was she dressed like a clown?

13:19.229 --> 13:20.463
- No.
- No?

13:20.497 --> 13:22.498
She was a psychiatrist
trying to heal him,

13:22.532 --> 13:25.768
But then she literally
went crazy for him.

13:25.802 --> 13:26.952
Come on.
If you can't see that one,

13:27.004 --> 13:28.404
Then, I mean,
I can't turn you then.

13:28.438 --> 13:30.606
I mean, he is the one
with the groupie that walked in.

13:30.641 --> 13:32.942
- So what do we know?
- [laughs]

13:36.312 --> 13:37.980
- Hello.
- Hey.

13:38.015 --> 13:40.916
I need an epic comic book gift
for my boyfriend.

13:40.951 --> 13:42.685
What's your budget
look like today?

13:42.719 --> 13:46.489
Let's say 500-ish.

13:46.523 --> 13:47.823
500ish, huh?

13:47.858 --> 13:49.759
What do we got
in the $500 range

13:49.793 --> 13:52.144
That will knock
someone's socks off?

13:52.195 --> 13:54.163
A little bit higher
than 500,

13:54.197 --> 13:57.249
But it might make it
worth your while.

13:57.284 --> 14:01.003
Giant-Size X-Men #1
signed by Dave Cockrum.

14:01.038 --> 14:02.838
Hmm.

14:02.873 --> 14:04.707
Makes it fancy-schmancy

14:04.741 --> 14:07.109
'cause Dave Cockrum's
no longer with us.

14:07.144 --> 14:10.446
And he does like the X-Men.
I would love to see this.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.647
I'll run up
and get it.

14:11.665 --> 14:13.366
This is something
he would be, like--

14:13.417 --> 14:14.750
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

14:14.785 --> 14:17.119
This is, you know,
high-rung, holy grail.

14:17.153 --> 14:20.272
Here she is,
with the signature.

14:20.307 --> 14:21.724
Wow.

14:21.758 --> 14:26.261
So you had said
a little more than 500--

14:26.279 --> 14:29.832
- 575.

14:29.866 --> 14:32.001
Okay.

14:32.035 --> 14:35.204
So you couldn't do 550?

14:35.238 --> 14:38.941
Um...

14:41.628 --> 14:44.080
Okay.
I'll do it.

14:44.114 --> 14:47.483
This is a great lesson
on the virtue of patience.

14:47.517 --> 14:49.852
I told that guy,
"somebody will come in here

14:49.886 --> 14:52.054
And buy that book from me
at the price I'm asking,"

14:52.089 --> 14:53.689
And what happened?

14:53.724 --> 14:56.342
And your patience paid off.
It paid off.

14:56.376 --> 14:57.659
- You were--
- And you were right.

14:57.677 --> 14:58.744
- I don't know what to say.
- All right, all right!

14:58.795 --> 14:59.995
"I'm not a bad employee,
Kevin.

15:00.029 --> 15:01.864
I'm not.
I'm not what he says I am."

15:01.898 --> 15:04.700
"I just can't be
Waltstradamus!"

15:04.701 --> 15:07.146
[laughter]

15:09.055 --> 15:12.742
- A dollar is your change.
- Thank you very much.

15:12.776 --> 15:14.210
- Thanks for coming in.
- Thank you, guys.

15:14.244 --> 15:17.847
- Bye.
- Take care.

15:17.881 --> 15:22.017
Walter has always been
a massive New Jersey Devils fan.

15:22.052 --> 15:23.886
So Ming
had the amazing idea,

15:23.920 --> 15:25.954
"Man, let's give him
a Devils celebration."

15:25.972 --> 15:27.890
I mean, I was like,
"That is brilliant.

15:27.924 --> 15:30.159
That is something
that he cannot deny."

15:30.193 --> 15:32.211
So I knew a few people,
and I called up.

15:32.262 --> 15:34.013
And I was like,
"Look, I got the uber-fan--"

15:34.047 --> 15:35.598
I couldn't even finish,
"I got the uber-fan,"

15:35.632 --> 15:38.868
Before somebody was like,
"Walt Flanagan?"

15:42.923 --> 15:46.208
No way.

15:46.243 --> 15:49.945
All four of us walk in,
and my heart stopped, I thought.

15:49.980 --> 15:52.748
- Did it?
- I don't know.

15:52.783 --> 15:55.384
It really was one
of those moments

15:55.418 --> 15:58.154
That I never, ever thought
it would ever happen.

15:58.188 --> 16:01.090
- Jim Dowd, number 11.
- Yes! Nice.

16:01.124 --> 16:04.927
Bruce Driver, 23.
Grant Marshall, number 29.

16:04.945 --> 16:08.597
Game seven, Ottawa.
That pass to Jeff Friesen.

16:08.632 --> 16:09.665
That's right, bud.
That's right.

16:09.699 --> 16:11.033
- Game-winning goal.
- Right.

16:11.067 --> 16:12.802
Mr. History.
How are you, man?

16:12.836 --> 16:15.221
- Mr. Devil.
- There you go, that's good.

16:15.255 --> 16:17.389
- Number three.
- How we doing? How we doing?

16:17.440 --> 16:20.042
- Oh, my God, Ken Daneyko.
[laughter]

16:20.076 --> 16:22.428
Since you love the Devils,
and we're pretty excited

16:22.462 --> 16:23.629
And pumped about that,

16:23.680 --> 16:25.097
We're going to give you
four Devil logo imprints

16:25.131 --> 16:26.115
- With the Stanley Cup rings.
- Permanent ones.

16:26.116 --> 16:29.916
[laughter]

16:30.286 --> 16:33.172
They pull out the most
powerful rings in the universe.

16:33.223 --> 16:36.942
All four of them put them out
and right in front of my face.

16:36.993 --> 16:39.528
All four Stanley Cup rings
are just right there,

16:39.563 --> 16:40.896
Right in front
of my mouth.

16:40.897 --> 16:42.497
[laughter]

16:42.532 --> 16:44.867
Sounded very erotic,
didn't it?

16:44.901 --> 16:46.318
That's a ring, man,

16:46.369 --> 16:49.438
That won't be felled
by yellow or wood.

16:49.472 --> 16:51.040
There ain't no impurities
can defeat

16:51.074 --> 16:52.641
A Stanley Cup
championship ring.

16:52.676 --> 16:53.926
Yeah, everybody thinks

16:53.960 --> 16:55.244
It's green lantern's
most powerful ring.

16:55.262 --> 16:57.096
Wrong.
It's a Stanley Cup ring.

16:57.130 --> 16:58.964
This is unbelievable,
man.

16:59.015 --> 17:00.516
I don't even know if I--
I'm just, like--

17:00.550 --> 17:01.767
You guys got
a bucket or anything?

17:01.768 --> 17:03.068
[laughter]

17:03.086 --> 17:06.321
- You're good to go, bud.
- [laughs]

17:06.356 --> 17:09.675
- Big Walt. Oh!
- Nice! Nice! Yeah!

17:14.891 --> 17:17.542
Been a long time
since I was on ice skates.

17:17.594 --> 17:18.894
I don't want
to embarrass myself.

17:18.929 --> 17:20.846
You've already embarrassed
yourself by the--

17:20.896 --> 17:22.998
What are you talking about,
man? I paid them tribute.

17:23.032 --> 17:24.784
Because you could see
the hearts above your head, man.

17:24.818 --> 17:26.484
It was, like, weird,
puppy-love-type stuff.

17:26.486 --> 17:27.786
[laughs]

17:27.838 --> 17:30.639
Like as if, like, when
Marsha Brady met Davy Jones.

17:30.674 --> 17:33.676
In fact, you were saying
the same things she said.

17:33.710 --> 17:36.378
You could tell?
It was that noticeable?

17:36.413 --> 17:39.415
- No, not at all.
- [laughs]

17:39.449 --> 17:42.551
What is it about a bunch
of dudes who used to play hockey

17:42.586 --> 17:44.954
That can reduce you
to tears?

17:44.988 --> 17:46.539
I followed them since--

17:46.590 --> 17:48.157
Pretty much
since they came to New Jersey.

17:48.191 --> 17:49.825
And they actually

17:49.860 --> 17:52.962
Went to the pinnacle
of their league

17:52.996 --> 17:55.297
And won the championship
multiple times

17:55.332 --> 17:58.300
And made you proud to say
you were from New Jersey.

17:58.334 --> 18:01.137
And I followed it
with such passion,

18:01.171 --> 18:02.905
And I lived
and breathed it.

18:02.939 --> 18:05.207
I went to bed many a night
wondering, like, you know,

18:05.242 --> 18:08.644
What would it be like to skate
on a shift with ken daneyko

18:08.678 --> 18:10.679
Or be line mates
with Jimmy Dowd

18:10.714 --> 18:13.249
Or take a pass
from Grant Marshall?

18:13.283 --> 18:14.533
And the woman lying
next to him was like,

18:14.568 --> 18:15.951
"Would you shut up?"

18:15.952 --> 18:18.680
[laughter]

18:18.688 --> 18:20.155
- You ready?
- I don't know.

18:20.173 --> 18:23.058
Walt, Walt, Walt,
Walt, Walt, Walt, Walt.

18:23.093 --> 18:25.027
Give me a couple
of strolls here.

18:25.061 --> 18:27.129
- You're good to go, bud.
- [laughs]

18:27.147 --> 18:28.164
You ready, Bryan?

18:28.198 --> 18:29.849
- I'm ready.
- All right, man.

18:29.883 --> 18:33.002
He's going to cover
a lot of the net anyway.

18:35.922 --> 18:38.373
I can see you guys
have been practicing.

18:38.374 --> 18:39.774
[laughs]

18:39.876 --> 18:41.577
Now Dano's been retired
for a few years,

18:41.611 --> 18:44.112
But when he passed it,
did he pass it with force?

18:44.130 --> 18:45.948
Like, when it hit your stick,
were you like, "aah"?

18:45.982 --> 18:48.083
I played, like, you know,
a couple--some pond hockey

18:48.117 --> 18:49.485
And everything.

18:49.519 --> 18:50.886
But, you know, you're taking
a pass from, you know,

18:50.920 --> 18:54.523
Like, somebody who's
on not an NHL caliber player,

18:54.558 --> 18:55.774
It's different.

18:55.809 --> 18:57.776
You got to be ready for it,
and you got to make sure

18:57.828 --> 19:00.262
You don't look like some sort
of wuss accepting that pass.

19:00.297 --> 19:03.599
Like, taking a pass
from a man, you know, finally.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.000
[laughter]

19:05.068 --> 19:07.436
Finally what?

19:07.470 --> 19:09.338
Walt's experimenting.

19:09.372 --> 19:12.074
Walt, feed me.

19:12.108 --> 19:16.111
- Oh, what a pass by Walt.
- [laughs]

19:16.145 --> 19:18.380
- Whoo!
- Let's go warm up Bryan.

19:18.414 --> 19:21.150
- All right.
- [laughs]

19:21.184 --> 19:22.201
Come on, Walt.
Are you ready?

19:22.235 --> 19:25.321
Let's go.
Come on, walt.

19:25.355 --> 19:27.172
Oh!

19:27.207 --> 19:30.926
Fivehole!
Five-hole, baby!

19:30.961 --> 19:33.429
- There it is.
- Oh!

19:33.463 --> 19:35.130
I missed that one.

19:35.131 --> 19:37.131
[metallic clang]
[laughter]

19:38.632 --> 19:41.332
[laughter]

19:41.421 --> 19:45.207
- He made one save.
- Oh, my God.

19:45.242 --> 19:47.509
- Don't get gun-shy on us.
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

19:47.544 --> 19:50.112
- Big Walt!
- Oh!

19:50.146 --> 19:53.365
Walt's going
for the melon.

19:54.618 --> 19:56.986
Oh!

19:57.020 --> 20:00.039
He's out!
Man down!

20:03.126 --> 20:04.727
I can't thank you guys enough.
It's been--

20:04.761 --> 20:06.262
- Thanks, guys, appreciate it.
- It's been spectacular.

20:06.296 --> 20:07.630
I can't even
put into words how--

20:07.664 --> 20:09.248
- Pleasure for us.
- How special it was.

20:09.282 --> 20:10.833
- It's been fun, Walt.
- Thank you, mr. Devil.

20:10.867 --> 20:12.134
- I hope you enjoyed it.
- Thank you, mr. Driver.

20:12.168 --> 20:13.936
- Very enjoyable.
- Thank you, mr. Marshall.

20:13.970 --> 20:15.271
I can't thank
you guys enough.

20:15.305 --> 20:17.656
You know, it--it was
the best anniversary gift,

20:17.691 --> 20:21.043
You know, a New Jersey-ite
could ever get.

20:21.077 --> 20:24.413
Daneyko played for 20 years
and all with the same team.

20:24.447 --> 20:26.916
So I hope that inspired you
a little bit.

20:26.950 --> 20:28.834
You're like a Daneyko.
You're our Daneyko, dude.

20:28.868 --> 20:30.452
- Iron Man, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:30.487 --> 20:32.538
All--all this time
with one organization.

20:32.589 --> 20:34.456
Soon I'm going
to surpass Dano,

20:34.491 --> 20:37.893
And maybe I'll get my number
hanging from the rafters

20:37.928 --> 20:39.328
At the Stash.

20:39.362 --> 20:40.946
If I worked at that store
for 15 years,

20:40.981 --> 20:43.299
I'd be hanging
from the rafters at the Stash.

20:43.300 --> 20:46.898
[laughter]

20:47.404 --> 20:49.204
Well, that's going to do it
for another episode

20:49.239 --> 20:50.472
Of Comic Book Men.

20:50.507 --> 20:51.907
I'm your host, Kevin Smith.

20:51.942 --> 20:53.475
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:53.510 --> 20:55.210
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:55.245 --> 20:57.846
Last one out of the Baxter
Building, turn the lights off.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.214
Good night.
