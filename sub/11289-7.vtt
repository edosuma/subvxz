WEBVTT

00:04.100 --> 00:06.700
Uh, Regine, it, uh, appears

00:06.766 --> 00:09.100
one of our wedding gifts
is, uh, missing.

00:09.166 --> 00:11.600
Obviously, you should've been
watching the gift table

00:11.666 --> 00:14.000
instead of Desmond Howard's
MVP behind.

00:16.332 --> 00:17.900
Excuse you!

00:17.966 --> 00:22.133
But I have never ever
misplaced a wedding gift.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.800
Even after that little melee
at Darrell's wedding

00:24.866 --> 00:28.333
when his trampy bride
swapped spit with the best man.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.732
Oh, Obie, how're we ever
gonna break it to Max

00:32.800 --> 00:33.766
that we lost her gift?

00:33.833 --> 00:34.800
What, Max?

00:34.866 --> 00:36.100
Oh, girl, please, now you know

00:36.166 --> 00:38.100
that cow is too cheap
to buy a gift.

00:40.300 --> 00:41.466
Yeah, don't you remember
that Christmas

00:41.533 --> 00:43.466
she wrapped up our toaster
and gave it to you.

00:45.566 --> 00:48.166
That's right. And there was
still a Pop Tart in it, girl.

00:49.833 --> 00:51.900
I'm still gonna have
a little chat with girly.

00:51.966 --> 00:54.566
Many times as she rolled up
on the buffet

00:54.633 --> 00:56.500
she should've gave us
three or four gifts.

00:56.566 --> 00:59.166
I mean, Khadijah,
the girl took home a ham.

01:02.906 --> 01:04.272
Now, hold up, Obie.

01:04.340 --> 01:06.440
Now, y..
You can't go at Max head‐on.

01:06.506 --> 01:08.173
You‐you'll get nothing.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.906
You've got to handle
this delicately.

01:11.406 --> 01:13.606
Max, I can't believe
you're too damn cheap

01:13.673 --> 01:16.406
to buy them a wedding gift.

01:16.473 --> 01:18.040
Excuse you.

01:18.106 --> 01:20.940
I would never forget
my dear friends.

01:21.006 --> 01:23.840
I just forgot
to give it to them.

01:23.906 --> 01:25.340
I'll go get it now.

01:28.073 --> 01:30.006

Now can you undo it so our place
don't look like such a dump?

02:15.613 --> 02:17.146
Fabulous news, kids.

02:17.213 --> 02:18.913
My new business cards
have arrived.

02:18.979 --> 02:23.313
So, if you meet
anyone rich or famous

02:23.380 --> 02:27.046
you can help me get into
their hearts and their wallets.

02:28.646 --> 02:29.880
And I'll be sure to tell them

02:29.946 --> 02:32.613
about that, uh, couscous
you made for our wedding.

02:32.680 --> 02:35.613
Mm‐hmm. Tasted like some
boujee grits to me.

02:37.646 --> 02:40.280
"Formal event planning
by Regine.

02:40.346 --> 02:42.780
"Specializing in
corporate parties, birthdays

02:42.846 --> 02:44.846
and bar mitzvahs."

02:46.580 --> 02:47.613
What?

02:47.680 --> 02:49.246
Oh, please,
after the religious part

02:49.313 --> 02:52.146
it's just a kids' party
with a rabbi instead of a clown.

02:54.180 --> 02:57.113
Oh, and anyway, I got
a great lead on this fundraiser

02:57.180 --> 02:59.413
being thrown by Dexter Knight.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.020
Oh, Dexter Knight.

03:01.086 --> 03:04.053
That's the brother that invented
the first black video game.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.053
‐ "Pacman in the hood."
‐ Mmm.

03:07.553 --> 03:09.253
You know, he's big.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.786
He's big alright.
About 300 pounds.

03:12.853 --> 03:15.386
You guys see him
on the cover of "Fortune?"

03:15.453 --> 03:17.586
Front and back.

03:18.753 --> 03:20.286
Come on, now.

03:20.353 --> 03:22.120
Cut the man some slack.

03:22.186 --> 03:25.020
'Cause, you know, he invented
my favorite video game.

03:25.086 --> 03:27.320
"Kricsa, Female Warrior."

03:27.386 --> 03:30.020
See, she travels through
all space and time

03:30.086 --> 03:33.020
decapitatin' evil doers
and buryin' their heads

03:33.086 --> 03:34.686
in her space garden.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.020
Well, uh..

03:38.086 --> 03:40.553
I'm gonna go and prepare
a sales pitch

03:40.620 --> 03:43.586
that'll make
his double chins drop.

03:43.653 --> 03:45.953
Millionaires love throwing
money at these shindigs

03:46.020 --> 03:48.020
and I just love
being the target.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.253
Hey, Shawshank!

03:56.086 --> 04:00.453
One wedding gift,
signed, sealed...and delivered.

04:00.520 --> 04:03.560
‐ Oh.
‐ Well, Max, you shouldn't have.

04:04.826 --> 04:06.460
Oh, yeah, she should have.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.360
"Congratulations..

04:11.193 --> 04:13.126
...on passing the bar?"

04:16.260 --> 04:18.692
Passing the bar, jump the broom,
what's the diff?

04:20.226 --> 04:22.793
Oh, look at this.
There's a check here for..

04:22.860 --> 04:24.393
W‐well, Max,
y‐you failed to fill out

04:24.460 --> 04:25.760
the amount on this check.

04:25.826 --> 04:27.926
Well, I just thought I'd leave
that up to you two kids.

04:28.760 --> 04:29.760
Mmm. Okay.

04:29.826 --> 04:32.260
How cheap am I now, Khadijah?

04:35.859 --> 04:39.126
And you have exactly seven
minutes to pitch your proposal

04:39.193 --> 04:41.860
to Mr. Knight which
by the looks of your resume

04:41.926 --> 04:43.926
should leave six minutes
for small talk.

04:46.860 --> 04:49.393
Good looks and a sense of humor.

04:49.460 --> 04:51.160
Aren't you a find?

04:59.526 --> 05:01.233
Okay, listen, God.

05:01.300 --> 05:04.500
Um, I‐I really need a miracle
here, okay?

05:04.566 --> 05:06.533
So, please get me this job.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.533
Please get me this job.

05:11.166 --> 05:12.500
‐ Miss Hunter?
‐ Uh!

05:15.300 --> 05:16.766
I'm Dexter Knight.

05:18.033 --> 05:19.333
[chuckles]

05:19.400 --> 05:21.333
You're Dexter K‐Knight?

05:22.966 --> 05:24.533
Oh, wait a minute,
wait, I‐I saw you

05:24.600 --> 05:27.233
on the cover of, of "Fortune"
and you were..

05:27.300 --> 05:29.533
Uh, were...husky.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.733
Please, I made
the nutty professor look skinny.

05:35.633 --> 05:36.766
But thanks to Oprah's chef

05:36.833 --> 05:39.000
and a few million miles
on a treadmill

05:39.066 --> 05:41.566
I've managed to shed
a few pounds.

05:41.633 --> 05:44.333
Um, looks like you held on
to the right ones.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.900
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say that.

05:48.966 --> 05:50.500
No, I mean, I meant to say it.

05:50.566 --> 05:52.400
I just didn't mean for it
to come out that..

05:52.466 --> 05:53.933
Can we start over?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.266
Hey, I'm flattered.

05:55.333 --> 05:57.133
Before I lost the weight,
the closest I ever got

05:57.200 --> 05:58.433
to a compliment was

05:58.500 --> 06:00.906
"Damn, man, you can
really put away that fudge."

06:04.906 --> 06:07.006
So, um...shall we
discuss the party?

06:07.940 --> 06:09.373
The party.

06:10.806 --> 06:12.706
The party, yes.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.873
The party. Ahem.

06:14.940 --> 06:18.873
You are hosting
a fundraiser for CHUMA.

06:18.940 --> 06:21.973
"Children of Harlem's
Underfed Minds Association."

06:22.040 --> 06:23.273
Well, you've done your homework.

06:23.340 --> 06:25.573
Well, you don't hear
a word like CHUMA

06:25.640 --> 06:27.706
without trying to figure out
what the hell it means.

06:27.773 --> 06:29.106
It's my pet charity.

06:29.173 --> 06:32.173
We fund education and resources
like the Schomburg Centre.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.773
I love the Schomburg.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.773
I was just there last week
for a poetry reading.

06:37.040 --> 06:40.873
"In secret we met,
in silence I grieve.

06:40.940 --> 06:44.306
"That thy heart could forget,
thy spirit deceive.

06:44.373 --> 06:47.706
And if I should meet thee
after long years.."

06:47.773 --> 06:49.940
"How should I greet thee?

06:50.006 --> 06:52.273
In silence and tears."

06:57.140 --> 06:58.473
[chuckles]

06:58.540 --> 06:59.880
That's my favorite poem.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.880
Mine too.

07:02.946 --> 07:04.213
You know, one day..

07:04.280 --> 07:06.013
[laughs]
When I was in the fourth grade

07:06.080 --> 07:08.646
I actually shared it
with my class.

07:08.713 --> 07:10.080
I got an A in English.

07:10.146 --> 07:12.880
And I got my butt kicked
all over the playground.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.580
You know,
nobody understood me either.

07:16.646 --> 07:18.646
So, I created imaginary worlds

07:18.713 --> 07:21.713
like Barbie's
dream villa in Italy.

07:21.780 --> 07:24.680
Of course, the gutters
of East Orange had to double

07:24.746 --> 07:26.113
for the canals of Venice.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.146
I love Venice.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.480
You, you've been to Italy?

07:29.546 --> 07:32.680
No. But, uh, I have a closet
full of Ferragamo pumps.

07:34.446 --> 07:36.246
(Mabel)
Yoo‐hoo, Mr. Knight.

07:38.446 --> 07:40.080
Linda Davis is here.

07:41.280 --> 07:44.680
She coordinated
the Jackie O auction.

07:44.746 --> 07:47.980
I heard the chicken wings
were scrawny and cold.

07:48.046 --> 07:49.813
Mabel..

07:49.880 --> 07:51.580
Have Linda wait.

07:51.646 --> 07:53.113
Of course.

07:54.846 --> 07:56.113
Half the people
bidding on this event

07:56.180 --> 07:57.580
don't give a damn
about the charity.

07:57.646 --> 07:59.246
They're just in it
for a big payday.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.786
Uh, leeches.

08:02.153 --> 08:03.453
I am committed to CHUMA.

08:03.520 --> 08:07.420
In fact, I would take
15% off of the lowest bid

08:07.486 --> 08:10.186
so that more money
can go to those kids.

08:10.253 --> 08:13.020
Miss Hunter,
I like your enthusiasm.

08:13.086 --> 08:15.686
Not to mention your style.

08:15.753 --> 08:17.020
You have got the job.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.153
Really?

08:19.220 --> 08:20.720
Just make sure
those chicken wings

08:20.786 --> 08:23.220
aren't scrawny and cold.

08:23.286 --> 08:24.353
Thank you.

08:24.420 --> 08:27.120
Thank you very much,
Mr. Right. K‐Knight!

08:28.586 --> 08:30.720
Please, call me Dexter.

08:31.986 --> 08:34.220
‐ Dexter.
‐ Yeah.

08:34.285 --> 08:35.753
And you may call me Regine.

08:35.820 --> 08:37.520
Thank you.

08:37.586 --> 08:39.186
Hey, you can call me
Nay‐Nay if you want.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.486
‐ "Nay‐Nay."
‐ Mm‐hmm.

08:42.553 --> 08:44.486
Charming name.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.686
It is now.

08:53.386 --> 08:54.486
Ooh!

08:54.553 --> 08:56.086
‐ Blank check from Max.
‐ Mmm.

08:56.153 --> 08:58.253
Girl, I feel like
we just won a Kentucky derby.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.053
Giddy up, mama.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.926
And what did we say
we'd do if we won?

09:01.993 --> 09:04.093
‐ Go to Africa!
‐ Go to Africa!

09:04.160 --> 09:05.426
Aha! Aha!

09:05.493 --> 09:07.526
I've always dreamed
of driving across the Serengeti.

09:07.593 --> 09:08.626
Zumbale‐baboole.

09:08.693 --> 09:12.626
Hah! Shirt open
from the hell‐like heat.

09:12.693 --> 09:15.493
Perspiration just glistening,
glistening.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.626
[ululating]

09:17.693 --> 09:20.093
Hoombalu. Hoombalu.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.326
Ooh.

09:21.393 --> 09:23.126
Star, I've got
the travel agent's number

09:23.193 --> 09:24.826
on speed dial. Let's go.

09:24.893 --> 09:26.826
Oh, slow your roll, King Tut.

09:26.893 --> 09:28.360
Now, if we take advantage of Max

09:28.426 --> 09:29.960
she'll never give us
another gift.

09:30.026 --> 09:31.126
Look here, mama.

09:31.193 --> 09:33.626
This right here
is the mountaintop.

09:33.693 --> 09:35.060
Kilimanjaro.

09:35.126 --> 09:37.393
I say, we get
while the gettin's good.

09:38.426 --> 09:39.460
Okay, fine.

09:39.526 --> 09:41.193
You write down a number.
I write down a number.

09:41.260 --> 09:42.926
We get the average,
put it on the check, okay?

09:42.993 --> 09:44.426
Go. Go.

09:48.493 --> 09:50.260
Oh, Obie, look at this,
we wrote the same number

09:50.326 --> 09:52.093
except mine doesn't have
all those zeros after it.

09:54.593 --> 09:56.226
You guys.

09:56.293 --> 09:58.826
Do you believe
in love at first sight?

09:58.893 --> 10:02.033
Is this about that fat guy
Khadijah was telling me about?

10:02.100 --> 10:05.500
Dexter happens
to have lost a 150 pounds

10:05.566 --> 10:07.633
and is fine as he wanna be.

10:08.866 --> 10:10.166
I'm telling you, man,
it was like..

10:10.233 --> 10:11.866
It was like Romeo and Juliet.

10:11.933 --> 10:14.600
Like, like Maria and Tony
in "Westside Story."

10:14.666 --> 10:16.433
Julia Roberts in "Pretty Woman."

10:16.500 --> 10:17.966
‐ Y‐yes!
‐ Yes!

10:21.733 --> 10:23.166
She was a hooker.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.200
Okay, so, she has a real career
and you don't.

10:32.566 --> 10:35.800
Did I mention
that I also got the job?

10:35.866 --> 10:37.466
If I ace this party, you guys..

10:37.533 --> 10:40.966
I‐I c.. I could be planning
a wedding of my own.

10:43.666 --> 10:45.466
Would you be my maid of honor?

10:48.200 --> 10:49.466
Uh‐uh.

10:51.100 --> 10:53.400
Ain't wearing
none of those fugly dresses.

10:55.066 --> 10:56.533
Oh, right.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.233
The budget
for the party came in.

10:58.300 --> 11:01.406
Yours truly sealed the deal
by promising to beat

11:01.473 --> 11:03.406
the lowest bid by 15%.

11:05.306 --> 11:07.440
Wait a minute, this..
This can't, this can't be.

11:07.506 --> 11:10.373
This, this budget isn't
enough to host 50 people

11:10.440 --> 11:11.873
let alone a hundred.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.206
Two words.

11:14.273 --> 11:15.806
Trail mix.

11:18.373 --> 11:19.773
Shut up!

11:21.040 --> 11:22.373
You guys,
thanks to this little screw up

11:22.440 --> 11:25.273
Dexter, Dexter might lose
all respect for me.

11:25.340 --> 11:27.373
Now, how is he gonna
love me after that?

11:27.440 --> 11:31.040
Love? Regine, you're trippin'.

11:31.106 --> 11:33.573
You know the rats in the alley
better than you know this man.

11:34.973 --> 11:37.406
You know what? Now,
looks like I may never know him.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.306
You know, maybe Regine Hunter

11:40.373 --> 11:42.440
is just meant
to die an old maid.

11:45.673 --> 11:47.606
Why should she be any different
from the rest of us?

11:54.206 --> 11:55.140
[sighs]

11:58.006 --> 11:59.640
[chuckles]

11:59.706 --> 12:01.380
Regine, cut the drama.

12:01.446 --> 12:04.013
I mean, there's gotta be a way
you can do this party.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.280
Yeah, I could do a great party
for a 100 people.

12:06.346 --> 12:08.713
It's just that 80 of them
won't be able to eat or drink.

12:11.013 --> 12:13.246
Oh, man, if I tell Dexter
that I can't make the budget

12:13.313 --> 12:15.113
he'll think I'm an amateur.

12:15.180 --> 12:18.013
Or worse, a scheming diva.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.446
Regine, you are a scheming diva.

12:22.780 --> 12:24.646
You know..

12:24.713 --> 12:25.880
You know that all my life

12:25.946 --> 12:27.613
I've done whatever it takes
to get the man.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.813
Mm‐hmm.

12:28.880 --> 12:31.980
But with Dexter,
I was completely honest.

12:32.046 --> 12:33.713
He'd ask me
if I'd ever been to Italy.

12:33.780 --> 12:36.213
Now, you know,
I have a dozen patented

12:36.280 --> 12:37.680
responses to that question.

12:37.746 --> 12:40.580
Some of which have me descended
from Venetian royalty.

12:42.013 --> 12:45.080
But what did I tell him? "No."

12:45.146 --> 12:47.380
And get this!

12:47.446 --> 12:49.380
I said he could call me Nay‐Nay.

12:50.913 --> 12:52.346
Damn, girl.

12:54.746 --> 12:56.413
You are sprung.

12:59.180 --> 13:00.520
What am I gonna do?

13:03.953 --> 13:07.520
Okay, Regine, I would never
give anybody this advice.

13:07.586 --> 13:09.186
Ever.

13:09.253 --> 13:10.853
Lie, girl! Lie!

13:11.986 --> 13:15.353
Y‐you dig deep
into that diva bag of tricks

13:15.420 --> 13:18.353
pull out the biggest, baddest
trick and go get that man.

13:20.453 --> 13:23.586
‐ I can't use that bag on him.
‐ Come on.

13:23.653 --> 13:24.986
‐ Just one more time.
‐ Mm‐mmm.

13:25.053 --> 13:26.753
Look, if it works, you'll have

13:26.820 --> 13:28.753
the rest of your life
to make it up to him.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.786
Of course,
there is always Russell.

13:36.220 --> 13:38.553
I guess I could come up
with a little some‐something.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.753
Sure you could.

13:42.820 --> 13:45.520
Yeah. I could, I could make
the hors d'oeuvres myself.

13:45.586 --> 13:46.820
Now, you're talking.

13:46.886 --> 13:49.053
‐ I can get you to help serve.
‐ Now, you trippin'.

13:51.986 --> 13:54.753
Hold the trays high
and walk as fast as you can.

13:54.820 --> 13:56.886
If anybody catches you
they're only allowed

13:56.953 --> 13:58.320
one shrimp per person.

13:58.386 --> 14:00.160
So remember their faces. Go.

14:01.993 --> 14:04.826
Uh, you guys, thank you
so much for helping out.

14:04.893 --> 14:06.393
It's nice to know
that I've got two friends

14:06.460 --> 14:07.893
who care enough
to just pitch in

14:07.960 --> 14:09.893
out of the goodness
of their hearts.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.226

for his next film.

14:16.860 --> 14:18.993
Mo' Better Synclaire.

14:19.060 --> 14:20.226
Yeah, and I'm gonna
audition for him

14:20.293 --> 14:22.693

14:22.760 --> 14:25.426

Here, knock yourself out..

14:27.993 --> 14:29.793
This salmon is
the only one that I have

14:29.860 --> 14:31.026
and it is for Dexter.

14:31.093 --> 14:34.026
Anybody touches it,
they draw back notes.

14:34.093 --> 14:35.793
Regine, the party is a big hit.

14:35.860 --> 14:36.860

14:36.926 --> 14:39.226
Oh, yes. She's a dynamic woman.

14:39.293 --> 14:40.826
And a wonderful boss.

14:40.893 --> 14:42.460
Yeah. Anyway, look here.

14:42.526 --> 14:44.760
I got a idea
for a new video game, right.

14:44.826 --> 14:48.060
Take a cyber hammer
and you hit a cyber nail.

14:48.126 --> 14:50.960
Sometimes you hit it.
Sometimes you miss.

a little nibble, huh?

15:09.800 --> 15:11.100
Thank you, Mabel.

15:11.166 --> 15:13.500
Senator Mason is one of CHUMA's
primary supporters.

15:13.566 --> 15:15.800
And the harder you laugh
at all his lame jokes

Hey, waiter, put the brakes
on that shrimp tray.

Come here.

Oh! Khadijah,
she's gonna ruin me.

15:40.133 --> 15:43.333
I bought enough food
for a party, not a country.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.500
Just relax. Relax.

I'm here to control her.

Oh, liar.

You're here to meet men.

Oh, that too.
And it is time to shop.

That old man is shopping too.

Wrong store, homie.

16:05.640 --> 16:06.906
Right, here's Max.

16:06.973 --> 16:09.873
Let's tell her we finally agreed
to an amount for her check.

16:09.940 --> 16:12.073
Hey, people.

16:12.140 --> 16:15.506
Now, when you decide
on an amount for that check

16:15.573 --> 16:17.706
you let me know. Alright?

16:17.773 --> 16:19.506
Because whatever
is left in the account

16:19.573 --> 16:21.606
is going to
the little CHUMA children.

16:21.673 --> 16:24.873
Mm‐hmm.

I'm sorry, I can't.

I would like you to meet
Regine Hunter.

The extraordinary woman
behind this event.

16:56.540 --> 16:58.140
A pleasure, Miss Hunter.

You know, Dexter, I'm a
little sad at your weight loss.

17:00.980 --> 17:04.613

count on him for two votes.

for 15 years.

confidential information.

that little pinch on my ass.

We didn't mean any harm.

17:40.613 --> 17:44.180
I mean, you know, you remind me
of a real young Pearl Bailey.

17:45.146 --> 17:46.346
‐ Me?
‐ 'Yes.'
