<i>From whence comes
the purpose of a person's life?</i>

00:28.595 --> 00:32.087
<i>Come it by chance, a casting of the lot,</i>

00:32.465 --> 00:36.128
<i>or does a call of destiny
beckon to each of us?</i>

00:39.239 --> 00:41.799
<i>Many have wondered
about my little Hadassah</i>

00:41.908 --> 00:44.001
<i>and why a simple Jewish orphan</i>

00:44.110 --> 00:48.444
<i>was chosen to stand against
the annihilation of her people.</i>

00:49.949 --> 00:53.146
<i>And yet the mystery of the girl
most know as Esther</i>

00:53.253 --> 00:55.244
<i>begins not where one might think,</i>

00:55.955 --> 00:58.253
<i>but 500 years earlier</i>

00:58.591 --> 01:01.458
<i>with a single act of disobedience.</i>

01:09.469 --> 01:11.369
<i>King Saul of the Israelites</i>

01:11.471 --> 01:13.803
<i>had been sent by the Prophet Samuel</i>

01:13.907 --> 01:18.241
<i>to wipe out
an ancient child-sacrificing enemy.</i>

01:19.112 --> 01:20.875
<i>So pervasive was their evil</i>

01:20.980 --> 01:24.381
<i>that not even their oxen nor sheep
were to be spared,</i>

01:24.784 --> 01:28.914
<i>and above all, no survivors left breathing.</i>

01:44.137 --> 01:48.574
My lord, I give you Agag,
king of the Amalekites.

01:49.075 --> 01:51.407
We have also seized for you his livestock.

01:51.511 --> 01:52.910
Even his queen.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.919
What dark portent bid me haste
to cross this land of ours?

02:12.031 --> 02:14.158
How would you accuse me now,
O Prophet?

02:14.267 --> 02:15.928
I carried out your lord's command.

02:16.035 --> 02:17.093
Then why do my ears

02:17.203 --> 02:21.071
ring with the lowing of oxen
and the bleating of sheep?

02:22.642 --> 02:25.133
Your Majesty, the Amalekite queen,

02:25.612 --> 02:26.977
she escaped.

02:28.448 --> 02:29.745
We have the king.

02:30.416 --> 02:31.781
What is one woman?

02:31.951 --> 02:33.612
You fool,

02:34.687 --> 02:36.154
she is with child.

02:40.627 --> 02:44.188
<i>While the Prophet Samuel
put a swift end to King Agag,</i>

02:46.599 --> 02:48.089
<i>Agag's queen,</i>

02:48.468 --> 02:52.336
<i>fleeing with the seed of vengeance
growing within her,</i>

02:52.705 --> 02:55.173
<i>the Jews never found.</i>

03:40.653 --> 03:42.416
Uncle Mordecai!

03:42.522 --> 03:45.548
Rebecca, what kind of housekeeper
do you think you are?

03:45.792 --> 03:48.659
Serves you right
for bringing home your work.

03:48.761 --> 03:50.820
The caravan arrived this morning.

03:51.297 --> 03:53.731
Well, Susa is the capital of the new world.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.528
Caravans arrive every day.

03:55.668 --> 03:57.226
Not from Jerusalem.

03:58.938 --> 04:00.462
Well, perhaps
you ought to go back and ask them

04:00.573 --> 04:03.041
if they'll arrive the same time next year.

04:03.676 --> 04:05.906
Next year? You promised.

04:06.112 --> 04:07.875
- Rebecca!
- Fight your own battles.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.848
You don't pay me enough
to fight the battle for you.

04:13.519 --> 04:15.953
- Good morning, Hadassah.
- And where have you been?

04:16.055 --> 04:18.579
I'm sorry, Grandmother,
the markets were really busy.

04:18.690 --> 04:20.089
There's a new caravan in from...

04:21.594 --> 04:23.824
- Sore subject.
- Uncle Mordecai,

04:24.197 --> 04:27.689
does not your own heart
long to see our people restored to glory?

04:27.800 --> 04:28.960
It does.

04:29.302 --> 04:33.329
Did not Cyrus the Great conquer Babylon
and free our people from captivity?

04:33.840 --> 04:34.807
He did.

04:35.608 --> 04:38.236
But do we embrace our freedom
and leave this pagan empire

04:38.344 --> 04:40.209
to embrace our destiny?

04:41.314 --> 04:43.248
- Of course not.
- Lord,

04:43.483 --> 04:45.075
I pray to you day and night

04:45.184 --> 04:46.913
to give me the patience of Job,

04:47.020 --> 04:48.749
give me the wisdom of Solomon.

04:49.055 --> 04:50.784
And what do you give me?

04:51.257 --> 04:54.317
You give me the endless equivocations

04:55.061 --> 04:57.427
of a beautiful, young woman.

05:23.823 --> 05:24.790
Look.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.627
Hadassah, always dreaming.

05:31.731 --> 05:32.959
Maybe...

05:34.567 --> 05:36.558
Here, then, you be the princess.

05:42.875 --> 05:46.641
<i>While many Jews had forgotten
the acts of centuries past,</i>

05:46.746 --> 05:49.909
<i>the descendants of Agag had not.</i>

05:50.983 --> 05:53.781
<i>For Agag's queen did indeed survive</i>

05:54.520 --> 05:56.681
<i>and gave birth to a son.</i>

05:58.991 --> 06:01.221
<i>And she forged for him a mark,</i>

06:02.595 --> 06:06.361
<i>prophesying that one day
an Agagite would arrive,</i>

06:07.266 --> 06:09.359
<i>a descendant of Agag,</i>

06:09.469 --> 06:12.404
<i>who would finally exact vengeance
upon the Jews.</i>

06:12.605 --> 06:15.301
Hadassah, read us a story!
Read us a story!

06:15.408 --> 06:17.103
A story? You want a story?

06:36.028 --> 06:38.829
- Hadassah, help!
- Over here.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.438
Are you okay?

06:55.348 --> 06:57.213
"And King Saul said to David,

06:57.950 --> 07:00.077
"'You cannot go before this Goliath

07:00.253 --> 07:01.880
"'for you are but a youth.'

07:01.988 --> 07:03.216
"David replied,

07:03.723 --> 07:07.159
"'While keeping my father's sheep,
there came a lion and a bear.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.750
"'And I slew them both.

07:08.861 --> 07:13.059
"'This Goliath shall be as one of them
for he defied the armies of the Lord."'

07:14.367 --> 07:16.699
As will Jesse Ben-Joseph,

07:16.803 --> 07:20.261
should he but take one step closer.

07:40.893 --> 07:42.360
With peace, Haman.

07:44.363 --> 07:47.355
- There's little but random news I bear.
- I judge that.

07:47.700 --> 07:48.997
Rumor has it

07:49.335 --> 07:52.998
Queen Vashti plans not to attend
the King's banquet this evening,

07:53.673 --> 07:55.231
in protest of the war.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.774
Apparently the King has no idea.

07:58.711 --> 08:01.805
Some see random news.
Others, opportunities.

08:02.448 --> 08:05.679
Of course,
this is why you are a dispatch rider,

08:05.818 --> 08:08.184
and I am a prince of the Fars.

08:08.888 --> 08:13.018
Tell me, Agagite, what do you do with
the extra darics you connive from me?

08:13.659 --> 08:15.320
I have 10 sons, my lord,

08:16.729 --> 08:18.856
and a wife that makes many demands.

08:22.034 --> 08:23.296
Ten sons?

08:25.171 --> 08:27.139
You serve the great king well.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.267
Come, come. Go you now.

08:30.810 --> 08:34.371
Speak of me
as you lavish your wife and sons.

09:12.985 --> 09:15.249
<i>Happy birthday, Hadassah!</i>

09:16.455 --> 09:17.786
A stone ball?

09:21.260 --> 09:24.957
Remember, Hadassah,
it is the glory of God

09:25.064 --> 09:26.588
to conceal a matter,

09:26.699 --> 09:28.826
the honor of kings to seek it out.

09:36.442 --> 09:38.205
It's from the Promised Land.

09:39.879 --> 09:42.347
Your great-grandmother
brought it with her.

09:42.548 --> 09:45.210
And like you, its true treasure

09:45.384 --> 09:48.046
is etched within.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.024
<i>Reconsider my proposition.</i>

10:01.133 --> 10:03.795
There is much need for leadership
in Jerusalem.

10:04.837 --> 10:06.065
More stew, my lord?

10:07.006 --> 10:08.906
I don't suppose that in your entire caravan

10:09.008 --> 10:11.340
you have a cook one half as good

10:11.811 --> 10:13.073
as our Rebecca.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.906
Here you are but a poor palace scribe,

10:16.215 --> 10:18.615
one who passes as a Persian, at that.

10:19.819 --> 10:23.050
Are you a Jew?
Or have you become a Gentile?

10:23.656 --> 10:25.123
We're a small people

10:25.524 --> 10:28.186
caught up in a vast and violent empire.

10:28.427 --> 10:29.792
We have capricious princes

10:29.895 --> 10:32.728
who could order our annihilation
with the flick of a finger.

10:32.832 --> 10:35.596
And your presence in the palace
might prevent it?

10:38.270 --> 10:39.464
Probably not.

10:40.106 --> 10:43.837
Look, tell me what I want to hear about.
Tell me about the Temple.

10:46.912 --> 10:51.406
What ecstasy to stand in the presence
of the Almighty!

10:51.984 --> 10:55.920
Like the intimate embrace
of a husband and wife.

10:56.522 --> 11:01.482
It's so much deeper
than mere mortal love.

11:02.962 --> 11:04.224
Oh, hello.

11:25.117 --> 11:28.951
<i>Now, it came to pass
in the days of King Xerxes,</i>

11:29.155 --> 11:32.716
<i>who ruled over the empire
of the Medes and Persians,</i>

11:32.858 --> 11:35.190
<i>from Ethiopia to India,</i>

11:35.361 --> 11:37.420
<i>that in the third year of his reign,</i>

11:37.530 --> 11:39.589
<i>he decreed a season of feasting.</i>

11:40.199 --> 11:42.565
<i>Rumors of war were in the wind, however,</i>

11:42.702 --> 11:47.298
<i>and some thought this the King's way
of stalling off a much-debated decision</i>

11:47.406 --> 11:51.433
<i>to march on Greece
in retaliation for his father's death</i>

11:51.677 --> 11:53.269
<i>four years before.</i>

12:01.454 --> 12:03.547
Queen Vashti, Your Majesty.

12:11.363 --> 12:12.330
Enter.

12:18.137 --> 12:21.072
The night's festivities
hold not your interest, dear?

12:26.312 --> 12:28.580
It is long since you summoned me here.

12:31.317 --> 12:34.150
- Your hands have not been idle.
- Not idle,

12:36.622 --> 12:37.987
not gifted either.

12:38.457 --> 12:40.584
Later, Hadassah,
we'll discuss this later.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.456
I have run out of laters.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.859
The caravan leaves tomorrow.

12:45.664 --> 12:48.064
Did not the priest even say
it would be good for me?

12:48.167 --> 12:49.964
That he would look after me?

12:51.103 --> 12:54.595
You have so much of your
mother and father in you, you know?

12:55.074 --> 12:57.440
And perhaps
I'm just being a very selfish old man.

12:57.543 --> 13:01.274
Do you really want to go to Jerusalem?

13:03.482 --> 13:04.449
Truly.

13:07.386 --> 13:09.081
Then go with my blessing.

13:11.857 --> 13:12.881
Thank you.

13:14.026 --> 13:15.425
Rebecca!

13:18.464 --> 13:21.194
Yes, well,
I will be late coming back tonight.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.928
The feasting has been extended.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.930
All Susa is invited.

13:26.338 --> 13:27.600
All of Susa?

13:30.009 --> 13:33.467
A drunken brawl is no place
for a young lady of purity.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.206
Then why is a good Jew like you going?

13:36.982 --> 13:39.450
All the scribes have to go!
There is war in the air!

14:08.080 --> 14:11.072
The Queen indeed
holds her own feast in protest.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.242
All is prepared as you have asked.

14:17.790 --> 14:21.920
You do know why the princes have asked
you to extend the feast another night.

14:25.231 --> 14:27.631
You are too late
if you seek me to deny them.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.064
Especially now.

14:29.201 --> 14:33.160
Such clamoring to march upon Greece
and avenge my father's death.

14:33.639 --> 14:36.164
How long have you dreamt
of molding Persia

14:36.542 --> 14:38.806
into a pillar of learning and culture?

14:39.545 --> 14:42.742
A flame to make even
the greatness of Greece but a shadow?

14:45.117 --> 14:46.607
You know as well as I,

14:47.486 --> 14:49.852
this is not something that is won in battle

14:49.955 --> 14:51.616
but in the hearts of men.

14:51.857 --> 14:53.950
You would have me do nothing, then?

14:55.861 --> 14:57.294
You're no warrior,

14:57.863 --> 14:59.125
no soldier.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.996
I'd have you stay,

15:10.676 --> 15:12.143
enhance your kingdom,

15:14.580 --> 15:15.842
preserve your throne.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.180
Looking for someone?

15:53.552 --> 15:55.315
I'm fine, thank you.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.012
You can run back to Rebecca now.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.555
Oh, I'm sure you're fine.

15:58.657 --> 16:00.352
Only tell me, Hadassah,

16:02.594 --> 16:04.027
or whoever you are,

16:04.563 --> 16:06.997
how do you intend to get into the palace?

16:08.434 --> 16:10.425
You didn't come to take me back?

16:11.270 --> 16:14.239
Come, or I shall call you
Hadassah the mouse.

16:19.912 --> 16:20.879
Wait!

16:23.015 --> 16:25.745
I appear to you by the gracious command

16:25.884 --> 16:27.749
of the great king of kings,

16:27.953 --> 16:32.014
the emperor of the world, Xerxes,
son of Darius.

16:56.515 --> 16:57.607
Great king.

17:01.387 --> 17:02.354
We drink.

17:02.588 --> 17:06.023
We drink also to my guard,
the immortal 10,000,

17:06.125 --> 17:09.652
but I fear I would soon have to send them
out to conquer new vineyards for me.

17:13.799 --> 17:17.666
Then let us drink to Queen Vashti,
the most beautiful in the land.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.762
Bring forth Vashti!

17:21.874 --> 17:23.171
Vashti!

17:24.643 --> 17:26.508
Bring forth Vashti!

17:28.012 --> 17:30.777
They are serious? They demand
Vashti be here before all?

17:30.883 --> 17:32.316
Already rumors circulate

17:32.418 --> 17:34.648
as to why the Queen holds her own feast

17:34.753 --> 17:36.243
instead of attending yours.

17:36.355 --> 17:37.982
They sound riotous, my lord.

17:38.090 --> 17:40.081
They fear a divided kingdom.

17:40.692 --> 17:43.991
My lord,
you know the Queen's position on the war.

17:46.965 --> 17:48.159
Send for her.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.672
They go to fetch the Queen.
She must be lovely,

17:54.907 --> 17:56.932
reigning in a place such as this.

17:57.042 --> 17:59.602
None is more lovely than you, my queen.

18:03.449 --> 18:05.576
- My thanks, fair prince.
- Prince?

18:08.487 --> 18:11.513
Why is it for years you threatened
to join the caravans to Jerusalem,

18:11.623 --> 18:13.113
yet you never do?

18:13.325 --> 18:14.792
What holds you back?

18:16.562 --> 18:18.655
Perhaps the courage to face it alone.

18:20.866 --> 18:23.025
What if you had someone to join you?

18:31.410 --> 18:33.241
The herald returns!

18:33.412 --> 18:35.744
The Queen asks the King's forgiveness.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.645
She cannot leave her guests.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.609
<i>I'm queen, not a pawn,</i>

18:40.719 --> 18:43.347
and I will not lower my dignity

18:44.389 --> 18:46.016
or shame my reign

18:46.892 --> 18:49.884
by wearing the royal crown
before your drunk

18:50.796 --> 18:52.821
and thinly veiled war council.

18:53.899 --> 18:55.696
What news of the Queen?

18:55.901 --> 18:57.493
Where is our queen?

18:58.370 --> 18:59.564
Queen Vashti!

18:59.771 --> 19:00.965
Queen Vashti!

19:01.940 --> 19:03.908
Am I to be a mockery before my subjects?

19:04.009 --> 19:05.374
Or Greece as well?

19:05.811 --> 19:08.245
- Continue, Cousin.
- Might not this

19:08.947 --> 19:10.471
deed of refusal

19:10.616 --> 19:12.277
travel abroad to all women,

19:12.384 --> 19:15.148
making their husbands
contemptible in their eyes?

19:15.354 --> 19:19.222
Will not it be said by all, "Xerxes
commanded his wife to come before him,

19:19.324 --> 19:20.484
"but she came not"?

19:20.592 --> 19:23.356
Vashti's guilty not only of
disobedience to the crown

19:23.462 --> 19:25.828
but against the protocol of our fathers.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.257
And tell me,

19:31.236 --> 19:33.261
what dictates the protocol?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.539
A royal edict must be issued

19:37.142 --> 19:39.440
and written into the rolls of the land

19:39.611 --> 19:40.805
that Vashti...

19:43.115 --> 19:46.243
That Vashti come no more before the King,

19:47.085 --> 19:50.748
but that her royal position
be given to a new queen,

19:50.856 --> 19:53.882
more worthy

19:54.793 --> 19:55.885
than her.

19:58.764 --> 20:01.756
My lord,
what answer do I send the Queen?

20:02.501 --> 20:03.490
Vashti!

20:03.735 --> 20:06.033
Vashti!

20:19.184 --> 20:21.675
The land has no more queen!

20:35.567 --> 20:37.899
I wish not to be queen here any longer.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.933
Mordecai is giving me his blessing.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.767
Let us leave tomorrow,

20:46.178 --> 20:47.145
together.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.532
<i>Thus the scribes were assembled,</i>

21:45.637 --> 21:47.571
<i>and a decree sent forth.</i>

21:47.973 --> 21:50.908
<i>The princes did indeed press upon Xerxes,</i>

21:51.009 --> 21:53.978
<i>the king, soon to depart for war,</i>

21:54.179 --> 21:56.409
<i>"Leave behind a queen</i>

21:56.915 --> 21:58.883
<i>"to keep the people unified."</i>

22:04.690 --> 22:06.783
<i>Every maiden was to be considered,</i>

22:07.326 --> 22:10.727
<i>the choicest of whom
to be brought from across the empire</i>

22:10.829 --> 22:12.319
<i>and into the palace.</i>

22:22.941 --> 22:24.932
<i>In accordance with the protocol,</i>

22:25.277 --> 22:28.212
<i>young men were also rounded up</i>

22:28.347 --> 22:29.871
<i>to become eunuchs</i>

22:29.981 --> 22:32.142
<i>who would serve the queen's candidates</i>

22:32.250 --> 22:34.275
<i>during their time of preparation.</i>

22:39.458 --> 22:41.153
<i>There's no need for alarm.</i>

22:41.660 --> 22:44.254
In all likelihood they will not come for you.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.628
And not all that are taken will be chosen.

22:47.733 --> 22:50.327
Doubtless, the queen
has already been selected

22:50.669 --> 22:52.534
through bribery or chicanery.

22:52.838 --> 22:54.703
How do I keep our laws?

22:55.140 --> 22:56.334
How do I pray?

22:57.242 --> 23:00.507
What excuse do I offer God
for not keeping his commandments?

23:00.912 --> 23:02.504
Oh, Hadassah.

23:03.348 --> 23:05.748
God sees the inward observance.

23:06.251 --> 23:08.344
The court is a dangerous place.

23:09.354 --> 23:11.049
I think it will be better

23:13.325 --> 23:15.418
if you forgot that you were a Jew.

23:16.828 --> 23:18.523
If this is a sin, then...

23:19.297 --> 23:21.060
Then let it be on my head.

23:21.533 --> 23:25.094
Promise me that you will do that
if you're taken. Promise me that!

23:25.904 --> 23:27.132
If I am taken,

23:27.839 --> 23:29.329
I will do as you say.

23:29.975 --> 23:33.206
I should give you a different name.
Hadassah is too Jewish.

23:36.815 --> 23:37.804
Esther.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.976
Esther is a good Babylonian name.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.815
Yes. That's what we shall call you
from now on.

23:44.556 --> 23:46.217
Esther of Susa.

23:47.993 --> 23:49.085
Promise me.

23:49.828 --> 23:51.625
Promise me if you are taken.

23:53.298 --> 23:55.596
I said, "If I am taken."

23:57.536 --> 23:58.662
If, if, if.

24:00.372 --> 24:01.464
But for now,

24:02.674 --> 24:05.507
you should look for me
in the streets of Jerusalem,

24:06.445 --> 24:07.412
dancing

24:09.514 --> 24:11.880
like David before the glory of the Lord.

24:13.051 --> 24:15.144
- Hadassah!
- Who?

24:24.830 --> 24:26.354
Uncle Mordecai!

24:45.750 --> 24:48.685
Is this the way
the King's orders are carried out?

24:49.120 --> 24:51.611
Senseless brutality
in the middle of the night?

25:23.321 --> 25:25.255
Father, please show us favor

25:27.192 --> 25:29.990
and turn these dungeons
into someplace wonderful.

25:36.167 --> 25:38.829
Is this the dungeon part
or the wonderful part?

26:05.397 --> 26:06.364
Look!

26:07.232 --> 26:09.723
Sarah, it matches your eyes.

26:10.035 --> 26:13.061
Have you ever found anything
so wonderful in your life?

26:15.173 --> 26:16.800
And Hannah,

26:17.375 --> 26:19.104
was it not made for you?

26:21.746 --> 26:24.214
Am I never going to see my mother again?

26:25.016 --> 26:26.677
Only if you wish not to.

26:27.185 --> 26:29.915
Two, three days, and who knows?

26:30.221 --> 26:31.347
Home you go.

26:34.059 --> 26:37.825
Do you think we're not beautiful enough
to be asked to stay, Hadassah?

26:39.264 --> 26:41.858
Welcome to a brand-new life.

26:42.734 --> 26:45.828
The method of your arrival
was not of my choosing.

26:46.638 --> 26:50.074
I am Hagai, His Majesty's Royal Eunuch.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.939
I have been assigned
to oversee your preparation.

26:54.646 --> 26:56.113
All right, it's okay.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.563
<i>Don't let them escape. Kill them all.</i>

27:19.104 --> 27:21.402
Which way to the quarter of the Jews?

28:40.585 --> 28:42.246
You have a very bad habit.

28:42.821 --> 28:44.948
The palace is no place for children.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.819
You think of me as a child?

28:48.226 --> 28:49.659
Well, you're wrong.

28:50.261 --> 28:52.058
I am much younger than that.

28:53.598 --> 28:55.088
How do they call you?

28:55.667 --> 28:57.658
- Esther.
- Curious name.

28:58.603 --> 29:00.264
From where do you come?

29:02.040 --> 29:03.632
I am of the wind

29:04.676 --> 29:06.803
whose sound is heard, yet none can tell

29:06.911 --> 29:09.175
from whence it comes or where it goes.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.542
Well, we gather within the hour.

29:13.218 --> 29:15.277
Try not to blow away before then.

29:22.293 --> 29:24.227
Another 4,000 talents

29:24.329 --> 29:27.423
for metal, weapons, armor.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.132
And we must not forget
the pay of the mercenaries.

29:30.235 --> 29:32.635
I know this is not a favored opinion,

29:32.971 --> 29:34.461
but if used for peaceful purposes,

29:34.572 --> 29:36.631
such amounts could serve many needs.

29:36.741 --> 29:39.073
Two different ways of life are involved.

29:39.177 --> 29:41.543
The Greeks have no king
and they want none.

29:41.646 --> 29:44.740
It is one thing to beat our chests
and parade our boldness

29:44.849 --> 29:47.340
pretending this is
still the empire of our fathers.

29:47.452 --> 29:50.319
But you hear the costs
of an actual campaign!

29:51.222 --> 29:53.383
If we are not honest with ourselves,

29:53.825 --> 29:56.555
I fear we lose much more
than just our stature.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.592
Then, let us sit back and do nothing?

29:58.696 --> 30:00.061
Let the Greeks conquer.

30:00.165 --> 30:02.395
Let them establish democracy.

30:04.035 --> 30:06.503
Would not the King be the first to suffer,

30:06.805 --> 30:08.136
the first to die?

30:08.473 --> 30:10.532
Or does the memory of his father's death

30:10.642 --> 30:14.203
not stir as deep in his bones
as it does in ours?

30:15.313 --> 30:18.373
I speak to you as one
not without empathy.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.182
I, too, have stood in the battle

30:21.419 --> 30:23.216
and stared into the unknown.

30:23.788 --> 30:27.053
For the very sword that took my eye

30:27.926 --> 30:30.622
took from me my manhood as well.

30:31.396 --> 30:32.693
<i>But be at peace.</i>

30:32.797 --> 30:35.265
<i>This is no warfare that you embark upon.</i>

30:35.967 --> 30:39.334
<i>This is only the life
that a great dreamer could imagine,</i>

30:40.138 --> 30:41.867
<i>or at least it can be,</i>

30:42.073 --> 30:43.973
<i>if you so choose to embrace it.</i>

30:57.088 --> 30:59.989
Think not I heard your
whispered orchestrations that night?

31:00.091 --> 31:01.922
And how you drew even me
into your schemes?

31:02.026 --> 31:05.257
In these troubled times
it is easy to name any man traitor.

31:05.964 --> 31:07.556
I even recall a certain campaign

31:07.665 --> 31:09.929
in lonia under King Darius,

31:10.034 --> 31:12.059
where someone allowed
the defeated Greeks

31:12.170 --> 31:13.831
to keep their own form of government,

31:13.938 --> 31:15.269
their democracy,

31:15.406 --> 31:17.966
instead of placing the protocol
of the empire in control.

31:18.076 --> 31:19.509
Favoring democracy.

31:19.777 --> 31:22.837
The very doctrine to which
all Persia is opposed.

31:23.848 --> 31:26.749
- I followed orders!
- Come. Come, come, come.

31:30.755 --> 31:33.189
We trouble ourselves with foolish things.

31:33.524 --> 31:36.015
The King asked me to speak. I did.

31:36.594 --> 31:38.892
I obeyed. As you obeyed.

31:41.699 --> 31:45.135
<i>With suspicion and mistrust
creeping into palace halls,</i>

31:45.737 --> 31:47.227
<i>Haman the Agagite</i>

31:47.605 --> 31:50.199
<i>found the opportunity
he had been waiting for.</i>

31:52.710 --> 31:54.575
<i>He began to strike out more openly</i>

31:54.679 --> 31:57.045
<i>at the Jews living in the outlying land,</i>

31:57.482 --> 32:01.111
<i>painting them
as the true Greek sympathizers,</i>

32:01.486 --> 32:06.014
<i>setting the stage
for his ultimate act of vengeance.</i>

32:52.236 --> 32:53.203
Look.

33:05.516 --> 33:07.074
I am curious

33:07.418 --> 33:10.114
to whether you frustrate me
out of sincerity

33:10.488 --> 33:13.150
or to ensure
that you're never chosen queen.

33:14.659 --> 33:17.651
You assume I actually care about
being chosen queen.

33:17.762 --> 33:19.024
I am serious.

33:19.330 --> 33:20.592
Serious of what?

33:20.698 --> 33:22.256
Finding a real queen?

33:23.334 --> 33:25.825
Is that why you subject us
to these beauty treatments,

33:25.937 --> 33:27.700
these classes?

33:27.905 --> 33:29.839
You do not like our fine instructors?

33:29.941 --> 33:32.034
They simply neglect to
teach us some things.

33:32.143 --> 33:34.043
- Such as?
- Well, seemingly

33:34.145 --> 33:36.545
anything to do with actually being queen:

33:36.647 --> 33:38.945
the thought well thought,
the word well spoken

33:39.050 --> 33:40.813
and the deed well done.

33:42.420 --> 33:44.320
As it is said in the great books.

33:44.422 --> 33:45.616
You read?

33:46.324 --> 33:47.518
Many tongues.

33:53.297 --> 33:55.993
Before I received your "invitation",

33:57.201 --> 33:59.328
I was reading of
Gilgamesh the Babylonian.

34:28.299 --> 34:31.029
<i>And Utanapishtim
spoke to Gilgamesh, saying,</i>

34:31.469 --> 34:34.404
"Gilgamesh, you look worn out
and exhausted.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.938
"What can I do
so that you can return to your land?

34:37.041 --> 34:39.407
"I will tell you a thing that is hidden.

34:39.877 --> 34:41.969
"There is a plant whose thorns

34:42.280 --> 34:44.373
"will prick your hand like a rose.

34:45.149 --> 34:47.117
"If your hands reach this plant,

34:48.018 --> 34:50.385
"you will become a young man again."

34:57.762 --> 35:00.595
<i>Gilgamesh in the original.</i>

35:01.032 --> 35:02.624
I read translation,

35:03.000 --> 35:04.934
never the original.

35:07.505 --> 35:08.563
You read?

35:10.274 --> 35:13.505
There are few pleasures left
to one such as I.

35:16.447 --> 35:19.041
You offer us Hagai's position, my lord,

35:19.417 --> 35:21.977
if we grant you the privilege
of picking a queen?

35:22.086 --> 35:24.418
- Misgath of Persepolis.
- Misgath?

35:26.124 --> 35:27.614
Of unusual beauty.

35:28.259 --> 35:29.556
But up here,

35:30.161 --> 35:32.823
- empty as a beggar's bowl.
- Consider her family.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.727
Daughter of a rug merchant?

35:35.133 --> 35:37.328
Will they not
also shower you with wealth?

35:44.976 --> 35:46.773
<i>While there were
certainly worse ways</i>

35:46.878 --> 35:48.937
<i>for the candidates to have spent their days</i>

35:49.046 --> 35:51.378
<i>than myrrh baths and beauty treatments,</i>

35:51.549 --> 35:54.643
<i>none of the rumors of riches and glory
stirred more excitement</i>

35:54.752 --> 35:58.518
<i>than the thought of gaining entry
to the royal treasury itself.</i>

35:58.856 --> 36:01.882
Whatever you chose
for your one night with the King

36:01.993 --> 36:04.427
will be yours for the keeping.

36:04.862 --> 36:08.389
Candidates, choose wisely.

36:24.715 --> 36:26.444
You stand not impressed?

36:26.684 --> 36:28.709
It matters not what impresses me.

36:28.819 --> 36:32.250
How is one to choose when
they know not what impresses the King?

36:32.356 --> 36:33.721
Will you teach me?

36:35.426 --> 36:38.190
I will do far more than that. Come.

36:44.502 --> 36:46.333
A recent acquisition.

36:46.437 --> 36:49.099
One, I believe,
the King will find most pleasing.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.669
Esther of Susa,

37:29.914 --> 37:30.881
come.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.252
Seat yourself on the stool

37:39.490 --> 37:40.889
and read the scroll.

37:40.992 --> 37:43.051
It is the chronicles of the King,

37:43.294 --> 37:44.727
the royal diary.

37:45.529 --> 37:48.692
Through these doors
you are no longer a candidate.

37:49.233 --> 37:50.723
You are a servant.

37:51.769 --> 37:53.361
Remember the protocol.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.297
To approach uninvited

37:56.874 --> 37:57.898
is death.

38:00.378 --> 38:01.811
I read for the King,

38:02.813 --> 38:03.780
alone?

38:04.649 --> 38:05.946
Like this?

38:56.667 --> 38:59.795
"Daily entry 23.

38:59.904 --> 39:02.464
"Egyptian wheat reserves were reported

39:02.573 --> 39:07.567
"at half the normal levels
due to a recent drought."

39:17.221 --> 39:20.190
"Admiral Xtes was honored

39:20.291 --> 39:23.226
"for serving twenty years
in the Royal Fleet.

39:23.327 --> 39:27.388
"After a lengthy speech,
he promptly keeled over and died."

39:34.305 --> 39:38.469
"Twenty-five. Three herd of sheep
were stolen from Dirmalmirah,

39:38.576 --> 39:40.635
"Satrap of Midea.

39:41.245 --> 39:44.703
"He requests that the crown send out
the proper authority."

39:47.485 --> 39:50.454
And so Jacob,

39:51.622 --> 39:55.080
also a shepherd by trade,

39:55.359 --> 39:58.817
was sent off into the far, far-off land

40:02.266 --> 40:05.599
where he came across the fair Rachel
tending her father's sheep.

40:05.703 --> 40:07.830
He was smitten,
and went and rolled the stone

40:07.938 --> 40:11.135
from the well,
and watered her flock for her.

40:11.642 --> 40:13.667
Then Jacob kissed Rachel

40:13.778 --> 40:16.474
and lifted up his voice and wept with joy.

40:16.580 --> 40:19.549
When Laban, Rachel's father, heard of this,

40:19.650 --> 40:24.246
he said to Jacob,
"Should you serve me for nothing?

40:24.355 --> 40:26.585
"Tell me, what shall your wages be?"

40:26.857 --> 40:30.918
Jacob said, "I will serve you seven years
for your daughter Rachel."

40:31.028 --> 40:35.055
So Jacob served seven years
tending Laban's sheep.

40:35.166 --> 40:40.126
And they only seemed but a few days,
for the love he had for her.

40:40.738 --> 40:41.898
Then Jacob said to Laban,

40:42.006 --> 40:45.498
"Give me my wife,
for my days are fulfilled."

40:45.609 --> 40:50.376
So Laban threw a great wedding feast,
but in the dark of the evening

40:50.481 --> 40:53.109
Laban brought
his older daughter in to Jacob.

40:53.851 --> 40:57.787
And, behold, in the morning
it was Leah, not Rachel.

40:58.856 --> 41:02.314
Jacob was shocked. He said to Laban,

41:02.726 --> 41:06.218
"What is this thou hast done unto me?

41:06.330 --> 41:08.855
"Did I not serve with thee for Rachel?

41:11.001 --> 41:13.731
"Why, then, have you beguiled me?"

41:13.838 --> 41:17.296
Why, then, have you beguiled me?

41:22.179 --> 41:25.080
I must admit that never before
has such a tale been found

41:25.182 --> 41:27.082
in the pages of a royal diary.

41:27.985 --> 41:31.113
Here I expect to be lulled to sleep
by tedious reports,

41:31.222 --> 41:34.680
instead I'm beguiled by a love story.

41:35.025 --> 41:39.928
And how ends your tale?
This Jacob, he's able to have his bride?

41:44.401 --> 41:46.733
He's able to have her?

41:51.709 --> 41:53.472
Only after serving

41:55.546 --> 41:57.878
seven more years for her, my lord King.

41:57.982 --> 42:01.440
Believeth you in such?

42:01.785 --> 42:03.548
Love?

42:03.654 --> 42:07.112
Is it not the greatest commandment?

42:07.458 --> 42:10.052
No matter what God one serves.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.890
- How do they call you?
- Esther of Susa.

42:12.997 --> 42:15.192
Susa? No.

42:15.299 --> 42:17.767
Nothing good ever comes out of Susa.

42:19.103 --> 42:20.468
Look at me.

42:26.076 --> 42:29.534
Come. Come, if you wish to see what I do.

42:43.627 --> 42:47.085
The Greeks, they have a god
of similar form.

42:48.198 --> 42:51.656
His arms will hold the bow,
whose arrows they say are

42:52.870 --> 42:55.031
tipped with love.

42:57.207 --> 43:00.399
Some archers' arrows are tipped
with poison, my lord.

43:00.511 --> 43:01.842
Sometimes

43:03.881 --> 43:07.874
it's hard to tell the difference.
The symptoms are the same.

43:11.322 --> 43:13.916
Perhaps in another time. Some

43:15.225 --> 43:16.192
other place.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.595
You will read to me again.

43:30.307 --> 43:32.571
You must tell no one of this night.

45:37.101 --> 45:40.400
- My Captain.
- Blame me not for this, my lord,

45:40.504 --> 45:43.371
but the princes have ordered us
to begin bringing you candidates

45:43.474 --> 45:46.102
- by the end of the week.
- You jest.

45:47.144 --> 45:51.672
- I am in the middle of...
- At least you'll get it over with.

45:51.782 --> 45:55.240
Besides, these men might enjoy
seeing some ladies around. No?

46:08.265 --> 46:10.893
They tell me you're called Esther now.

46:15.038 --> 46:16.505
Oh, Jesse.

46:18.375 --> 46:19.672
Hatach.

46:23.480 --> 46:25.971
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
were pagan names, too.

46:26.683 --> 46:28.275
We're in good company.

46:30.254 --> 46:32.950
Their names were Hananiah, Mishael
and Azariah.

46:33.724 --> 46:35.919
They were thrown into the furnace.

46:36.093 --> 46:38.721
But then what happened?

46:40.264 --> 46:43.233
Come on, I found a way out.

46:43.333 --> 46:46.234
And there's a caravan
leaving for Jerusalem tonight.

46:46.336 --> 46:49.032
So we can get out of this place.

46:49.306 --> 46:50.739
Escape?

46:52.943 --> 46:56.401
Jesse, I... I can't leave.

46:58.148 --> 46:59.410
What if...

47:01.151 --> 47:04.609
- What if I'm chosen?
- What if you're chosen what?

47:06.290 --> 47:09.748
What if you're chosen queen?
Look what they've done to us.

47:11.361 --> 47:13.454
What good could come out of any of this?

47:16.099 --> 47:19.557
Perhaps, instead of
asking questions of our trials...

47:21.672 --> 47:23.799
Trials are meant to ask questions
of ourselves.

47:23.907 --> 47:25.397
They cut me!

47:28.011 --> 47:29.308
I know

47:30.180 --> 47:31.841
we can't be what I hoped,

47:31.949 --> 47:34.417
- but...
- Jesse.

47:36.186 --> 47:39.553
I can't leave. I'm sorry.

47:42.392 --> 47:44.690
I'm sorry.

47:52.469 --> 47:54.562
<i>Today it begins.</i>

47:54.671 --> 47:58.004
<i>Each of you will be given
one night with the King.</i>

47:58.108 --> 48:01.703
<i>We gather first to honor
Misgath of Persepolis.</i>

48:01.812 --> 48:05.077
<i>You enter as a peasant
and leave a princess.</i>

48:12.823 --> 48:13.790
Here we go.

48:16.994 --> 48:18.484
Steady her.

48:23.667 --> 48:26.033
I'm so sorry...

48:26.303 --> 48:28.430
- Oh!
- Almost there.

48:33.310 --> 48:35.301
By the looks of it,
I must be allowing the candidates

48:35.412 --> 48:37.403
to keep their jewelry.

48:38.215 --> 48:41.673
Perhaps a horseback ride
is not the best idea, my lord.

48:53.430 --> 48:56.228
You weep not for the candidates
this evening.

48:58.268 --> 49:01.795
- My throat is sore.
- Your throat or your heart?

49:03.206 --> 49:06.664
It has only been a few days
since you read for him.

49:09.346 --> 49:12.247
A few days is a thousand years.

49:13.116 --> 49:18.053
If Xerxes had found pleasure in me,
surely he would've...

49:19.823 --> 49:22.485
You think a eunuch cannot know love?

49:22.592 --> 49:25.618
Back before I was a cripple of a man,

49:25.729 --> 49:27.663
there was one that held my heart.

49:30.233 --> 49:31.666
What became of her?

49:34.604 --> 49:36.697
I know not.

49:37.040 --> 49:40.498
I never found the courage to return
to face her again.

49:45.282 --> 49:48.740
She is beautiful but delicate,
Your Majesty.

49:50.721 --> 49:52.951
Just one more moment, please.

50:05.068 --> 50:07.036
You may approach.

50:13.143 --> 50:15.634
How do they call you?

50:43.974 --> 50:46.340
Esther.

50:47.411 --> 50:49.936
This is your day.

50:50.080 --> 50:52.947
<i>We gather to honor Esther of Susa.</i>

50:53.050 --> 50:56.508
<i>You enter as a peasant
and leave a princess.</i>

51:04.161 --> 51:06.095
You can let go of my arm now.

51:09.099 --> 51:12.557
He will be the fortunate one
to choose you.

51:14.538 --> 51:17.996
He will be the one
to whom congratulations are due.

51:22.179 --> 51:25.171
Esther, my arm.

51:43.433 --> 51:45.560
The scroll is on the stool.

51:45.702 --> 51:48.296
You may begin whenever you are ready.

51:52.476 --> 51:54.034
Is there a problem?

51:55.245 --> 51:58.703
Did they not tell you I weary
at this procession of candidates?

52:00.283 --> 52:03.116
I simply wanted someone to...

52:05.155 --> 52:08.613
Wait.
You are the one who read to me before.

52:08.725 --> 52:11.455
You tried to beguile me with love stories.

52:11.795 --> 52:16.289
Did you not think I had the sense
to see through your little parable?

52:16.399 --> 52:19.459
The arrogance! You speak to me
as if I was this Rachel

52:19.569 --> 52:21.833
in need of help to look after
my father's sheep.

52:21.938 --> 52:25.396
- My lord, I meant no...
- And this is how you come to see me?

52:26.743 --> 52:28.802
Your only adornment before your

52:29.713 --> 52:31.112
one night with the King.

52:32.816 --> 52:35.979
It is, Your Majesty.

52:37.420 --> 52:40.878
You consider yourself of so little worth

52:42.092 --> 52:46.222
- that I can purchase your love so cheaply?
- I was taught

52:49.533 --> 52:54.163
that when you visit a king,
rather than expect a gift,

52:54.271 --> 52:57.069
one should bring one to lay at his feet.

53:06.750 --> 53:10.208
This is my most
valuable possession in the world.

53:14.991 --> 53:19.951
It is my past, my present, and my future.

53:21.331 --> 53:24.061
And all of it is yours.

53:31.975 --> 53:36.708
Some would call you foolish indeed,
as they would call your Jacob.

53:36.813 --> 53:41.113
Of all commodities, love is the easiest,

53:43.253 --> 53:45.278
and most cheaply purchased.

53:49.192 --> 53:51.786
If it is for sale, my lord,

53:53.697 --> 53:54.755
it is not love.

53:56.433 --> 53:57.695
Even you.

54:00.570 --> 54:03.471
Even you must have a price.

54:03.673 --> 54:06.141
I am neither a buyer

54:08.979 --> 54:10.742
nor a seller of love.

54:14.217 --> 54:15.946
Suppose, my lady,

54:16.453 --> 54:19.616
a man offered you a more treasured gift,

54:20.657 --> 54:23.558
say, a kingdom.

54:39.175 --> 54:42.633
The only gift I would accept

54:44.381 --> 54:46.315
is your heart.

54:50.420 --> 54:53.321
Then it is yours.

54:54.591 --> 54:58.049
And you did not serve
seven years to get it.

54:58.561 --> 55:02.463
Tell me Esther of Susa,
who are you really?

55:05.168 --> 55:07.261
Tell me of your people.

55:08.204 --> 55:10.695
Teach me of your ways.

55:13.076 --> 55:14.703
My father taught me

55:17.314 --> 55:19.748
it takes the glory of God

55:20.216 --> 55:23.049
to conceal a matter,

55:24.187 --> 55:28.146
and the honor of kings to search it out.

55:34.497 --> 55:36.795
Then marry me.

55:40.136 --> 55:45.039
And we shall spend an eternity
discovering this truth,

55:47.143 --> 55:48.474
together.

56:48.138 --> 56:50.698
Persians, your queen!

56:57.213 --> 57:00.740
Know you how many times I tried to
come for you after that first night?

57:05.654 --> 57:07.645
How many evenings
I spent counting the stars

57:07.756 --> 57:10.020
to keep my mind off of you?

57:16.365 --> 57:18.765
How many excuses I created

57:19.502 --> 57:21.629
just to avoid the other candidates?

57:36.218 --> 57:37.947
Fools.

57:38.087 --> 57:39.748
Misfits.

57:40.623 --> 57:42.591
Donkey-brained caricatures of men,

57:42.691 --> 57:46.388
you guaranteed me that Misgath
would be chosen queen.

57:46.495 --> 57:49.953
Who is she? From whence did she come?
Who are her people?

57:50.232 --> 57:53.133
There is little known about her, my lord.

57:53.235 --> 57:56.534
She is called Esther of Susa. An orphan.

57:56.639 --> 57:59.369
We should've stuck to our first plan
and poisoned Hagai ourselves.

57:59.475 --> 58:00.908
- Quiet.
- Poison?

58:01.010 --> 58:04.343
He did not, my lord.
He is far too impetuous.

58:04.446 --> 58:07.472
- Far too...
- You know about poison.

58:07.583 --> 58:09.608
Of course you do.

58:09.952 --> 58:12.318
You were once the royal cupbearers.

58:14.423 --> 58:18.359
Suppose in theory,
you wanted to poison another.

58:22.131 --> 58:27.091
Suppose... Suppose this other
remained nameless,

58:28.137 --> 58:32.164
but was, in effect, one whom
you had once vowed to protect.

58:32.274 --> 58:34.071
My lord prince...

58:34.877 --> 58:38.335
Come, come. Don't look so distressed.

58:39.548 --> 58:41.209
We plot nothing here.

58:42.284 --> 58:43.842
My lord.

59:18.387 --> 59:20.218
From India to Babylon,

59:20.756 --> 59:24.214
my sword has spilt the blood of
traitors against the crown.

59:25.227 --> 59:29.755
Proud, arrogant "chosen ones".

59:31.000 --> 59:33.059
Allowed to return to their homeland.

59:34.470 --> 59:35.937
But do they go?

59:37.573 --> 59:38.904
Do they?

59:55.058 --> 59:56.252
Thank you.

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.525
How wonderful are the ways of the Lord

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:05.465
that he should have raised up
my little Hadassah

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:07.661
and made her queen.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:12.063
Have you told anyone our secret?

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:16.002
No.

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:19.548
If you continue to call me Hadassah,
it will no longer matter.

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:21.977
Will you not join me in the palace?

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:24.144
I could have you named
to any post you desire.

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:26.848
My Lord will take care of me.

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:30.652
Do you take care of your lord?

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:39.361
Remember not his orders?

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:43.132
Procure it not from the palace,
so nothing can be traced back to us.

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:45.841
The Jews have apothecaries.

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:54.513
Where is he now?

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:59.388
- You, over there...
- Why cannot a truce be arranged?

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.013
Truce?

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:05.349
That devil Memucan
has beaten me twice in a row.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.187
I fear losing you.

01:01:11.234 --> 01:01:13.134
I gave an oath

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:16.437
to my father.

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:20.636
He's the one I fear losing you to.

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:24.202
You must dream. You'll be gone much
in the coming months.

01:01:24.748 --> 01:01:26.443
Keep this for me.

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:31.248
- But it is yours. I...
- Then be at peace.

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:32.978
I always return for what is mine.

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:36.547
Will thou sit there all day, my lord?

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:45.097
This one.

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:57.008
Why would they
buy belladonna off you?

01:01:57.113 --> 01:02:01.413
Maybe they seek to poison someone.
Very deadly, very quick.

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:04.546
You sold them poison?

01:02:05.155 --> 01:02:09.387
A Jew sells poison
to the King's food tasters?

01:02:09.526 --> 01:02:12.620
Have you any idea for whom
it might've been intended?

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:28.861
Please, just allow me to see it.

01:02:28.972 --> 01:02:32.203
The scribe says it is
for the Queen's eyes only.

01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:35.105
That is what she told.

01:02:59.269 --> 01:03:00.930
A plot to kill the King.

01:03:01.205 --> 01:03:04.663
The King should be notified at once,
my lady.

01:03:06.009 --> 01:03:09.137
He and Memucan are a day's ride away
at the training grounds.

01:03:09.246 --> 01:03:12.272
Then it would be better, my lady,
if I send for the captain of the guard

01:03:12.382 --> 01:03:15.840
- to investigate.
- Who else is closest to the King?

01:03:15.953 --> 01:03:17.386
Admantha.

01:03:22.326 --> 01:03:24.294
This is treachery.

01:03:24.862 --> 01:03:29.356
If my lady will permit, I myself
will bring these two eunuchs to you.

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:33.633
I'm armed, so I doubt the need for force.

01:03:33.737 --> 01:03:35.705
That will not be necessary.

01:03:35.806 --> 01:03:39.264
The King's new captain of the guard
has gone to investigate.

01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:43.102
Time was of the essence, my lady.

01:04:05.536 --> 01:04:09.472
If only all shared your loyalty
to the King, my prince.

01:04:10.974 --> 01:04:13.340
Captain of the guards.

01:04:17.047 --> 01:04:19.515
Master Haman, my lady.

01:04:27.691 --> 01:04:30.057
What of the eunuchs?

01:04:31.295 --> 01:04:34.321
They are being led
to the gallows as we speak.

01:04:34.431 --> 01:04:37.229
I found this about their person.

01:04:39.002 --> 01:04:40.367
I interrogated them both.

01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:42.301
I'm convinced they plotted alone.

01:04:51.582 --> 01:04:54.380
Make sure Mordecai's name
is entered in the chronicles

01:04:54.484 --> 01:04:58.978
and that it is certified with my seal so
he may be properly rewarded by the King.

01:05:09.032 --> 01:05:11.057
Please, help yourself.

01:05:11.835 --> 01:05:13.166
Only a bite.

01:05:14.805 --> 01:05:17.330
Now I no longer ride the highways,
my appetite suffers.

01:05:17.441 --> 01:05:20.535
Then may I assume that your fee
for spying for me will be reduced?

01:05:20.644 --> 01:05:22.407
My appetite may be less,

01:05:22.512 --> 01:05:23.979
not of my sons,

01:05:25.649 --> 01:05:26.911
my wife.

01:05:28.452 --> 01:05:31.182
Well, that may cost you more, my prince.

01:05:31.855 --> 01:05:33.322
Much,

01:05:33.423 --> 01:05:35.914
- much more.
- What might you have done?

01:05:38.662 --> 01:05:42.120
I would save the King for last.

01:05:42.966 --> 01:05:46.129
As in the palace board game.
Rid yourself first

01:05:46.236 --> 01:05:48.761
of all of those pieces
that are closest to him.

01:05:48.872 --> 01:05:50.066
One

01:05:52.376 --> 01:05:53.502
by one.

01:06:08.392 --> 01:06:12.590
- My lady, this is foolish.
- I go with or without you.

01:06:12.696 --> 01:06:14.425
There are too many rumors
drifting through the palace,

01:06:14.531 --> 01:06:16.123
and not enough answers.

01:06:20.504 --> 01:06:22.267
These hinges are well-oiled.

01:06:22.539 --> 01:06:24.234
There must be plenty who use it.

01:06:24.341 --> 01:06:27.003
Lovers always find a way, my lady.

01:06:29.713 --> 01:06:32.739
The time has come,
my brothers and sisters,

01:06:32.849 --> 01:06:35.977
where we must root out
those amongst our midst

01:06:36.086 --> 01:06:38.316
who seek our wreck and ruin!

01:06:38.422 --> 01:06:42.290
When a field of crops is defiled by disease,

01:06:42.392 --> 01:06:45.156
do we not set it on fire?

01:06:46.863 --> 01:06:51.425
I am asked why I choose
to speak against these foreigners

01:06:51.535 --> 01:06:53.560
and strangers in our midst.

01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:57.128
- The Jew!
- The Jew!

01:07:00.644 --> 01:07:03.078
No, not the Jew.

01:07:03.547 --> 01:07:07.916
I, myself, know many an individual Jew
who I am proud to call friend,

01:07:08.018 --> 01:07:12.455
but put these individual Jews together,
and what are Egypt,

01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:16.648
Assyria, Babylon in their wake?

01:07:32.943 --> 01:07:35.741
Lead me away from here, quickly.

01:07:36.513 --> 01:07:38.413
You want proof?

01:07:39.316 --> 01:07:40.840
Proof!

01:07:42.352 --> 01:07:45.810
Pulled from the royal library,

01:07:48.992 --> 01:07:52.689
<i>the great scheme of
the Greeks and the Jews</i>

01:07:52.796 --> 01:07:55.424
to conquer the world!

01:07:58.068 --> 01:08:00.935
For let me tell you,
the Greeks and the Jew

01:08:01.037 --> 01:08:04.029
both live by the same evil doctrine.

01:08:04.141 --> 01:08:06.200
All men are created equal.

01:08:08.745 --> 01:08:13.444
- Do you believe you are equal to a slave?
- No!

01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:17.750
<i>And you believe neither in
the Jewish God, nor in Greek democracy,</i>

01:08:17.854 --> 01:08:21.312
but there are others in the palace that do.

01:08:22.492 --> 01:08:25.950
Let me now speak of Memucan.

01:08:26.662 --> 01:08:29.426
Prince. General.

01:08:29.666 --> 01:08:31.224
Arch traitor!

01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:35.365
"For services rendered to King Darius.

01:08:35.839 --> 01:08:39.296
"Pacification of the Babylonian provinces.

01:08:41.278 --> 01:08:44.145
"Payments made to Haman the Agagite."

01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:47.910
When? When?

01:08:48.852 --> 01:08:50.444
Ask of Memucan

01:08:50.554 --> 01:08:54.149
why he allowed the Greeks of lonia
to retain their democracy.

01:08:55.559 --> 01:08:59.120
Ask whose voice is loudest
against the war today

01:08:59.229 --> 01:09:01.857
and you will find out it is he!

01:09:05.202 --> 01:09:06.897
"Common year."

01:09:08.805 --> 01:09:11.069
Thirteen years ago.

01:09:17.314 --> 01:09:19.077
My lady.

01:09:29.893 --> 01:09:31.258
Are you alone?

01:09:35.332 --> 01:09:39.996
- Highly unsafe.
- I was just finishing.

01:09:48.345 --> 01:09:49.835
Please.

01:09:51.715 --> 01:09:53.841
Allow me.

01:10:13.336 --> 01:10:16.794
- Shall I return this for you?
- Thank you.

01:10:20.744 --> 01:10:24.646
Something must weigh heavy
on my queen's heart

01:10:25.382 --> 01:10:27.714
in order to be kept up
at this hour, reading.

01:10:30.287 --> 01:10:31.845
My queen.

01:10:40.497 --> 01:10:43.955
- Is her Highness unwell?
- I'm fine.

01:10:45.101 --> 01:10:47.331
Perhaps I should retire.

01:10:57.981 --> 01:11:00.541
You're not scheduled
at the palace for more than two weeks.

01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:02.584
She'll be wonderfully surprised,
think you not?

01:11:02.686 --> 01:11:04.950
Here, read this, my lord.

01:11:08.558 --> 01:11:10.890
You do not appear
to be a traitor, Memucan.

01:11:10.994 --> 01:11:12.928
Return with me, and I'll have
Admantha investigate

01:11:13.063 --> 01:11:14.690
Haman's accusations immediately.

01:11:14.798 --> 01:11:17.358
Haman is my appointment.

01:11:17.467 --> 01:11:19.935
And we do need him more than we realize.

01:11:20.036 --> 01:11:22.266
Truly, Memucan, at one moment you sulk,

01:11:22.372 --> 01:11:25.739
you say your name has been slurred,
now you plead for your accuser.

01:11:25.842 --> 01:11:29.073
I have enough lives on my conscience.

01:11:29.179 --> 01:11:33.172
Chastise him mildly,
and he will perform his duty well

01:11:33.283 --> 01:11:36.741
and be more grateful to you
for your leniency.

01:11:37.387 --> 01:11:38.854
Spoken like a true Persian.

01:11:38.955 --> 01:11:43.085
Never judging a man before all the good
and all the bad are weighed.

01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:45.453
Ride with me.

01:11:45.862 --> 01:11:49.764
- So you burnt the evidence?
- Worry not, action will still be taken.

01:11:50.433 --> 01:11:54.392
Lest you forget, this Haman
is now head of internal protection.

01:11:54.504 --> 01:11:56.904
And lest you forget, I'm still queen.

01:11:57.007 --> 01:12:00.568
Yes, but queen subject to
an ancient protocol that no doubt Haman

01:12:00.677 --> 01:12:02.872
knows how to manipulate
far better than you do.

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:12.579
Go not by the main gate.

01:12:12.689 --> 01:12:15.556
I wish not for the Queen
to be alerted to my coming.

01:12:17.761 --> 01:12:18.955
You must promise me

01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:21.854
that you will not reveal this to anyone.

01:12:24.367 --> 01:12:27.928
Any more such promises
and I shall have to take a vow of silence.

01:12:31.074 --> 01:12:33.269
Rusty old lovers' gate.

01:12:33.376 --> 01:12:36.436
I trust you used it much
in your youth, Memucan.

01:12:36.546 --> 01:12:40.004
Who do you think had it installed?

01:12:42.719 --> 01:12:44.653
Go now.

01:13:01.137 --> 01:13:04.197
My love. Oh, how I've missed you.

01:13:04.307 --> 01:13:07.003
- Have you?
- Now, what is that supposed to mean?

01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:10.040
You looked flushed. Busy morning?

01:13:10.146 --> 01:13:12.706
Not as busy as it could get.

01:13:12.816 --> 01:13:14.044
No visitors?

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:20.378
You sent for me, Your Highness?

01:13:22.592 --> 01:13:24.856
It appears you have
misplaced our necklace.

01:13:24.961 --> 01:13:28.419
I wonder if that is all you have misplaced.

01:14:22.852 --> 01:14:26.447
Perhaps Your Majesty would like to send
for one of the concubines.

01:14:34.731 --> 01:14:36.596
Perhaps not.

01:14:38.735 --> 01:14:40.566
You look so much like your father.

01:14:40.670 --> 01:14:43.605
Sometimes I forget
how different you truly are.

01:14:43.706 --> 01:14:48.666
Makes me wonder all the more why
you feel such need to follow in his steps.

01:14:52.615 --> 01:14:54.480
Give her a few more nights,

01:14:58.354 --> 01:15:00.686
and then have her brought to me.

01:15:04.928 --> 01:15:07.021
You call that public tirade subtle?

01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:08.722
You mock me, Agagite.

01:15:08.831 --> 01:15:11.595
I need but report
but once to the King of your arrogance.

01:15:11.701 --> 01:15:15.159
And your dreams of kingship die with me.

01:15:15.471 --> 01:15:18.372
You might be less harsh on the Jews.

01:15:18.474 --> 01:15:20.237
You should make yourself
a laughing stock.

01:15:20.343 --> 01:15:21.867
The Jews, my prince,

01:15:22.679 --> 01:15:25.614
will be your chief weapon by which
you attain power to the throne.

01:15:25.715 --> 01:15:29.674
Think, we plan to take the crown by force
when the King is deep in Greece.

01:15:30.386 --> 01:15:32.251
What excuse will you use?

01:15:32.855 --> 01:15:34.789
Who attacks the land?

01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:36.849
Well, no one, actually.

01:15:38.161 --> 01:15:41.619
Unless, of course,
you claim it was the Greek-loving Jews.

01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:47.158
Memucan expects an apology,
as you predicted.

01:15:47.437 --> 01:15:51.032
Well, an apology is a cheap enough price
to pay for a kingdom.

01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:53.802
<i>Invite, then, Memucan to your estate.</i>

01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:57.505
<i>Presumably so I can apologize to him.</i>

01:15:57.614 --> 01:16:01.072
<i>On the way, however,
he will be ambushed.</i>

01:16:01.551 --> 01:16:05.146
<i>- By whom?
- By my Jews, of course.</i>

01:16:05.255 --> 01:16:07.723
Jews who slew him
for being coupled with them as a traitor.

01:16:07.824 --> 01:16:11.282
- And what of Memucan's own guard?
- It's merely an apology.

01:16:11.894 --> 01:16:13.953
Perhaps you can suggest to Memucan

01:16:14.063 --> 01:16:15.394
that if he arrive with a large number,

01:16:15.498 --> 01:16:17.090
I might suspect he'd come
to punish me.

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:19.600
One or two guards my men can handle.

01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:22.802
And who'll handle you?

01:16:23.406 --> 01:16:25.169
Who but you,

01:16:25.975 --> 01:16:27.465
my king.

01:16:35.385 --> 01:16:37.649
Prepare to die, Greek-lover.

01:16:57.907 --> 01:17:00.000
Admantha's men.

01:17:01.177 --> 01:17:03.475
Thank the gods you are unharmed,
my lord.

01:17:07.317 --> 01:17:08.375
Come.

01:17:32.642 --> 01:17:33.870
My queen...

01:17:37.113 --> 01:17:38.603
Your Highness,

01:17:39.349 --> 01:17:41.817
blood has been spilled.
You are needed at once.

01:18:00.336 --> 01:18:03.772
But lord King,
an accusation by a dispatch ride.

01:18:03.906 --> 01:18:06.670
Why did you wait so long
to inform anyone of Admantha's plot?

01:18:06.776 --> 01:18:10.109
- Surely you don't...
- My lord, I had to but play the traitor

01:18:10.213 --> 01:18:11.976
to catch the traitor.

01:18:13.416 --> 01:18:17.318
Where are his witnesses, my lord?
What were my motives?

01:18:17.587 --> 01:18:22.047
Let this Haman prove his words
or be forever silent.

01:18:22.158 --> 01:18:23.682
But what would he have
me show, my lord?

01:18:23.793 --> 01:18:26.853
There are no witnesses
to plans forged in secret.

01:18:27.363 --> 01:18:28.853
You will not act like that, Admantha.

01:18:28.965 --> 01:18:32.867
And was it not even Admantha
who stirred the crowd into demanding

01:18:33.035 --> 01:18:36.664
Queen Vashti's appearance,
knowing she would not come?

01:18:36.939 --> 01:18:39.339
All lies. That's lies.

01:18:39.509 --> 01:18:42.672
Lies. I stand in a crumbling house of lies.

01:18:42.779 --> 01:18:46.112
- Remember before whom you plead.
- Plead for what?

01:18:47.784 --> 01:18:49.649
For your life, Admantha.

01:18:59.695 --> 01:19:02.528
Is it my foolish desire
to believe these stories I hear

01:19:02.632 --> 01:19:05.795
or my glaring inability
to perceive their mysteries?

01:19:06.769 --> 01:19:08.236
Perhaps you...

01:19:08.638 --> 01:19:11.903
You placed them back
upon the shelf to collect dust

01:19:12.642 --> 01:19:14.906
without ever truly completing them.

01:19:16.846 --> 01:19:19.212
Who is the one that gathers dust?

01:19:19.515 --> 01:19:21.449
I believed I was your Rachel.

01:19:22.885 --> 01:19:26.787
But it appears I'm only Leah,
and you serve time with me for another.

01:19:27.023 --> 01:19:31.483
No, my lord. It's not what you think.

01:19:33.596 --> 01:19:35.791
Nothing is as I think anymore.

01:19:36.566 --> 01:19:38.659
Plots slither through the night.

01:19:38.801 --> 01:19:42.567
Trust, it decays
like secret gates left to rust.

01:19:43.139 --> 01:19:47.007
Admantha is carried to torture
even as we speak.

01:19:54.584 --> 01:19:59.248
This Jacob and Rachel,
they are no mere story to you.

01:19:59.522 --> 01:20:03.014
Give me some incentive
to believe in who you really are.

01:20:03.226 --> 01:20:04.955
Give me some honor.

01:20:05.161 --> 01:20:08.961
For if it is truly the honor of kings
to seek out truth in lie,

01:20:11.133 --> 01:20:12.862
I am a man of scorn.

01:20:15.304 --> 01:20:17.067
I will answer you,

01:20:18.508 --> 01:20:21.500
my lord, if you first answer me.

01:20:22.378 --> 01:20:23.970
Answer you what?

01:20:24.313 --> 01:20:28.443
Why did you summon Vashti

01:20:30.686 --> 01:20:32.654
when you knew she would not come?

01:20:34.824 --> 01:20:37.622
I am king.

01:20:40.997 --> 01:20:42.794
And I need answer to no one.

01:20:55.778 --> 01:21:00.215
<i>After many days of torture,
Admantha, the great Midian prince,</i>

01:21:00.416 --> 01:21:02.316
<i>finally confessed all,</i>

01:21:02.418 --> 01:21:05.979
<i>and was dealt with
according to the protocol of the land.</i>

01:21:09.292 --> 01:21:13.956
<i>For his brave and valorous services,
Haman the Agagite</i>

01:21:14.096 --> 01:21:16.121
<i>was proclaimed a prince of the Fars</i>

01:21:16.265 --> 01:21:20.565
<i>to inherit Admantha's house,
wealth, prestige and power.</i>

01:21:22.004 --> 01:21:23.528
Pieces are falling into place

01:21:23.639 --> 01:21:27.131
we've spoken of, one by one.

01:21:28.978 --> 01:21:31.572
Soothsaying does not become you,
Haman.

01:21:31.881 --> 01:21:34.941
No, my darling,
I speak of the truth, not of stars.

01:21:36.352 --> 01:21:38.946
My burden I would not wish on any man.

01:21:41.891 --> 01:21:44.758
The blood of my forefathers
will be avenged.

01:21:46.095 --> 01:21:49.929
And the gods will smile down on our son
through our obedience.

01:21:50.299 --> 01:21:53.496
And are you mad? This is your plan?

01:21:54.203 --> 01:21:56.694
It is not that our allies
are unwilling, my lord,

01:21:56.806 --> 01:21:58.603
but they have not fared well.

01:21:58.708 --> 01:22:01.404
A storm has robbed the Phoenicians
of a good part of their fleet.

01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:05.310
Carthage finds herself short in timber
with which to complete our warships...

01:22:05.414 --> 01:22:08.178
Surely the fate of the empire
does not hinge on money?

01:22:08.284 --> 01:22:11.412
- Are you ready to furnish it, then?
- No, not I, my lord.

01:22:11.554 --> 01:22:14.352
But I'm aware of traitors
within our borders that could.

01:22:14.457 --> 01:22:16.755
The Jews? We are not children.

01:22:16.859 --> 01:22:18.349
Nevertheless, the money may be raised

01:22:18.461 --> 01:22:21.362
by the confiscation
of Jewish wealth and property.

01:22:21.464 --> 01:22:24.365
And the Jews will just
hand it over without a fight?

01:22:24.467 --> 01:22:26.059
No, of course not.

01:22:26.969 --> 01:22:29.096
First we must kill them all.

01:22:30.539 --> 01:22:32.302
Every last one of them.

01:22:32.408 --> 01:22:35.673
It is the only way to ensure
they do not rise up and seek revenge.

01:22:35.778 --> 01:22:38.246
He speaks of women
and children, my lord.

01:22:38.347 --> 01:22:40.281
Yes, women and children.

01:22:42.518 --> 01:22:43.678
I know.

01:22:46.922 --> 01:22:48.583
What is your solution?

01:22:48.691 --> 01:22:52.593
Or would you rather, my dear Memucan,
the Greeks and the Jews unite

01:22:52.728 --> 01:22:55.288
and, hand in hand,
murder us in our beds while we sleep?

01:22:55.398 --> 01:22:58.697
Is the past so mighty
that we must destroy our brothers

01:22:58.801 --> 01:23:00.632
to be free of its grasp?

01:23:03.305 --> 01:23:07.605
No kingdom was ever so grand
as the Jews' own King Solomon.

01:23:07.710 --> 01:23:11.476
He fought not one battle,
toiled through not one war,

01:23:12.181 --> 01:23:15.639
but prospered upon the peace
handed down by his father.

01:23:16.419 --> 01:23:20.219
Do not make void what your
own father's death has purchased.

01:23:20.356 --> 01:23:23.416
- By picking back up...
- Mind your tone, General.

01:23:24.026 --> 01:23:26.085
Why thirst you for warfare

01:23:27.196 --> 01:23:29.756
when we can drink so deeply of peace?

01:23:30.399 --> 01:23:33.300
You speak of peace,
let us speak of the Jews.

01:23:33.636 --> 01:23:37.595
They would rather bow down to their own
God than obey the laws of protocol.

01:23:37.707 --> 01:23:40.335
Their prophets even speak
of a coming king.

01:23:40.443 --> 01:23:44.311
A king who will reign over all kings
and set all men free.

01:23:46.949 --> 01:23:50.578
Is that not the very essence of democracy,
my dear Memucan?

01:23:50.686 --> 01:23:53.177
I do believe, under your guidance,
we are undone.

01:23:53.289 --> 01:23:56.554
If we are undone,
we are undone from within, indeed.

01:23:58.961 --> 01:24:00.861
March upon Greece, if you wish.

01:24:00.963 --> 01:24:03.796
But you march
with no general in your lead.

01:24:11.373 --> 01:24:14.171
Then it has not yet been signed into law?

01:24:15.945 --> 01:24:17.708
Not as yet, my lady.

01:24:18.581 --> 01:24:21.641
Perhaps guilt stirs men too hotly at times,

01:24:22.151 --> 01:24:24.278
and they seek the salve of the law

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.683
to ease the burning.

01:24:29.325 --> 01:24:31.555
And what would you have me do?

01:24:32.495 --> 01:24:35.623
I cannot seek him in the library
unless summoned.

01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:46.570
<i>If you arrived first,</i>

01:24:46.675 --> 01:24:50.167
<i>then he in effect
would be seeking you, would he not?</i>

01:24:55.084 --> 01:24:58.918
How came you pass my guard?
I demanded none use the library this night.

01:24:59.021 --> 01:25:01.512
I seek that which you seek, my lord.

01:25:06.529 --> 01:25:07.655
Truth.

01:25:09.932 --> 01:25:12.730
Perhaps the truth
of what exists between us?

01:25:13.736 --> 01:25:16.000
I have come on matters of state.

01:25:16.105 --> 01:25:17.697
Matters of state.

01:25:18.974 --> 01:25:20.100
I see.

01:25:22.077 --> 01:25:24.443
And what matters of state might that be?

01:25:24.547 --> 01:25:27.345
You desire more perfumes?
You request more condiments?

01:25:27.449 --> 01:25:30.009
Surely as queen of the kitchen,
you need not await me here.

01:25:30.119 --> 01:25:34.180
You know as well as I how quickly word
travels throughout the palace.

01:25:35.758 --> 01:25:38.192
Especially when murder's involved.

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:41.761
You are... You are learned, well-read.

01:25:42.565 --> 01:25:44.999
Offer me a story that
answers my dilemma.

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:48.297
- I have never pretended with you.
- Never pretended?

01:25:48.404 --> 01:25:50.065
Think you not that I see
Memucan's strings

01:25:50.172 --> 01:25:51.662
dangling above your head even now?

01:25:51.774 --> 01:25:54.504
You care more for these Jews
than you do for me.

01:25:54.610 --> 01:25:58.011
Do you enquire of my burdens,
do you offer me solutions?

01:25:58.247 --> 01:25:59.271
No.

01:25:59.849 --> 01:26:01.517
You just complain.

01:26:01.984 --> 01:26:04.612
- As Vashti did?
- Away from me!

01:26:04.753 --> 01:26:07.313
And come before me no longer,
no matter what pretense you seek,

01:26:07.423 --> 01:26:10.119
or your fate shall be worse than Vashti.

01:26:12.328 --> 01:26:15.263
- But I do love you.
- Love has failed me.

01:26:16.732 --> 01:26:19.792
Knowledge has failed me, thus
I bind myself to the protocol

01:26:19.902 --> 01:26:21.995
of my fathers and to my empire.

01:26:22.104 --> 01:26:24.265
By the next moon, I leave for war.

01:26:24.406 --> 01:26:28.103
And whatever my fate,
it shall no longer be shared with you.

01:26:44.627 --> 01:26:47.221
This was once your favorite reading.

01:26:47.329 --> 01:26:50.492
And though it may no longer
bear the story of love,

01:26:52.835 --> 01:26:55.099
it bears that of one Mordecai the Jew.

01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:00.803
One of whom you wish to destroy
saved your life.

01:27:04.046 --> 01:27:06.640
And you never even honored him for it.

01:27:15.691 --> 01:27:18.660
The casting of the lot, the Pur...

01:27:19.695 --> 01:27:23.256
It has determined upon which day
all the Jews of the kingdom will be slain.

01:27:25.367 --> 01:27:28.029
This day is to be the 13th day
of the month of Adar

01:27:28.137 --> 01:27:30.128
according to the calendar of the Jews.

01:27:30.506 --> 01:27:31.768
Prince...

01:27:35.611 --> 01:27:37.704
The annihilation of a people

01:27:38.781 --> 01:27:43.275
can only be authorized by one
who bears the signet of the King himself.

01:27:56.265 --> 01:27:58.529
<i>And those letters were sent
into all the land,</i>

01:27:59.268 --> 01:28:03.534
<i>to slay and annihilate all the Jews</i>

01:28:03.639 --> 01:28:06.802
<i>on the 13th of Adar,
some six weeks hence.</i>

01:28:07.710 --> 01:28:11.771
<i>Both young and old,
men, women and even children.</i>

01:28:13.148 --> 01:28:16.948
<i>And to plunder all of their possessions
for the sake of the crown.</i>

01:28:47.683 --> 01:28:51.414
The scribe insists that
all is dependent upon you, my queen.

01:28:52.421 --> 01:28:54.048
Dependent upon me?

01:28:54.823 --> 01:28:58.350
My queen might wish
to go before the King and intercede

01:28:59.228 --> 01:29:03.460
for those that have no other hope.

01:29:06.635 --> 01:29:07.932
My lady...

01:29:08.337 --> 01:29:10.805
Have you forgotten your protocol?

01:29:10.939 --> 01:29:12.873
To approach the King
unsummoned is death.

01:29:12.975 --> 01:29:16.570
Perhaps in court.
But surely you can visit him in private.

01:29:17.346 --> 01:29:18.904
In his chambers.

01:29:21.717 --> 01:29:23.275
Surely I cannot.

01:29:33.295 --> 01:29:35.286
<i>Obedient I have been.</i>

01:29:36.565 --> 01:29:39.227
<i>I walk before you with a loyal heart.</i>

01:29:41.370 --> 01:29:45.864
<i>And now I stand in the hour of trouble
precisely because of my obedience.</i>

01:29:48.010 --> 01:29:49.773
I beseech you, Father,

01:29:51.013 --> 01:29:53.004
<i>let there be another way.</i>

01:29:54.283 --> 01:29:57.013
<i>Rise up a deliverer and let this pass.</i>

01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:00.087
<i>Let this pass.</i>

01:30:01.123 --> 01:30:02.613
<i>"'Comfort,</i>

01:30:03.192 --> 01:30:05.490
"'comfort my people,' says your God.

01:30:06.128 --> 01:30:07.686
"Cry unto Israel

01:30:09.431 --> 01:30:11.592
"that her warfare is finished,

01:30:13.836 --> 01:30:15.701
"that her iniquity is removed.

01:30:16.638 --> 01:30:20.165
<i>"The everlasting
neither faints nor is weary.</i>

01:30:20.776 --> 01:30:24.007
<i>"His understanding no one can fathom.</i>

01:30:24.246 --> 01:30:27.943
<i>"He gives strength to the weary
and power to the weak.</i>

01:30:28.684 --> 01:30:31.949
<i>"Even the youth shall faint and be weary,</i>

01:30:32.421 --> 01:30:35.151
<i>"and young men shall utterly fail.</i>

01:30:35.290 --> 01:30:39.852
<i>"But those who wait on the Lord
shall renew their strength."</i>

01:30:40.829 --> 01:30:44.629
Lord, we wait on thee.

01:30:46.635 --> 01:30:48.330
Renew our strength.

01:30:48.904 --> 01:30:50.769
<i>Clear the way for he who comes.</i>

01:30:50.873 --> 01:30:53.034
Kneel before the great prince.

01:30:53.175 --> 01:30:56.872
Clear the way for he who comes.
Kneel for the great prince.

01:30:57.779 --> 01:30:58.905
You...

01:31:01.083 --> 01:31:04.109
Lower yourself to honor
the great Prince Haman. Kneel!

01:31:04.253 --> 01:31:05.982
- I said kneel.
- Stop!

01:31:15.797 --> 01:31:19.096
- Why do you not kneel?
- I kneel before my king.

01:31:20.002 --> 01:31:23.165
I abase myself
only before the God of my fathers.

01:31:23.472 --> 01:31:26.805
- What's his name, this God?
- The great I AM.

01:31:27.075 --> 01:31:30.374
The one true God,
the maker of heaven and earth.

01:31:30.812 --> 01:31:34.373
The God of Abraham,
of Isaac and of Jacob.

01:31:37.119 --> 01:31:38.245
A Jew.

01:31:38.754 --> 01:31:41.279
Mordecai Ben-Yair.

01:31:42.491 --> 01:31:43.856
Mordecai...

01:31:47.229 --> 01:31:49.720
I shall name my prize pig after you.

01:31:49.998 --> 01:31:53.525
Perhaps I may give you other reasons
to remember my name.

01:31:53.735 --> 01:31:55.726
You will remember mine

01:31:56.672 --> 01:31:57.895
for this!

01:32:04.012 --> 01:32:05.240
Move on.

01:32:09.551 --> 01:32:11.382
What good did that do?

01:32:11.486 --> 01:32:14.819
You still ended up
on the ground like the rest of us.

01:32:19.094 --> 01:32:20.857
But I did not kneel.

01:32:23.398 --> 01:32:27.459
Come, now, you are a mere three days
from being handed a kingdom.

01:32:27.569 --> 01:32:31.733
We must not let one Jew rob us of our joy.

01:32:31.974 --> 01:32:33.839
That is not good enough.

01:32:35.911 --> 01:32:38.903
Then seek permission
to honor the King's departure

01:32:39.014 --> 01:32:40.914
with a public execution of a rebel

01:32:42.084 --> 01:32:45.850
<i>a symbol of your authority
over those that remain.</i>

01:32:45.954 --> 01:32:50.914
<i>A gallows, 50 cubits high
with Mordecai right...</i>

01:33:10.345 --> 01:33:11.607
The chronicles.

01:33:28.196 --> 01:33:29.288
Rise.

01:33:29.665 --> 01:33:32.498
A matter disturbs me.
You may be of assistance.

01:33:32.868 --> 01:33:37.100
I am most pleased, my lord,
for I, too, desire your counsel on a matter.

01:33:37.539 --> 01:33:40.167
A certain man
has rendered great service to me.

01:33:40.275 --> 01:33:43.039
He has received many honors
amongst his people,

01:33:43.145 --> 01:33:45.136
but he once saved my life.

01:33:45.947 --> 01:33:50.509
I feel, despite everything, full recognition

01:33:50.652 --> 01:33:52.517
has not yet been given him.

01:33:52.621 --> 01:33:55.613
What think you, shall be done
for this man in whom the King delights

01:33:55.724 --> 01:33:56.986
to honor?

01:33:58.327 --> 01:34:00.693
Let a royal robe be sent for,

01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:03.990
one his Majesty has donned in public.

01:34:07.636 --> 01:34:09.035
And a horse

01:34:10.038 --> 01:34:13.974
on whose head a royal crest is set.

01:34:16.445 --> 01:34:21.382
Deliver them to
one of the noblest princes of the Fars,

01:34:21.783 --> 01:34:25.082
so that he can array the man
in whom the King delights.

01:34:26.021 --> 01:34:30.014
And then parade this man
through the streets, proclaiming,

01:34:30.158 --> 01:34:34.652
"Thus shall it be done to the man
in whom the King delights to honor."

01:34:36.198 --> 01:34:38.166
Most excellent proposal.

01:34:38.967 --> 01:34:42.027
Go yourself now
and do all you have suggested.

01:34:42.304 --> 01:34:43.532
My lord.

01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:46.732
To a one Mordecai,

01:34:48.610 --> 01:34:51.511
the scribe who
sits within the King's gates.

01:34:55.917 --> 01:34:57.145
Mordecai?

01:34:58.887 --> 01:35:00.081
The Jew?

01:35:16.071 --> 01:35:17.163
My lady.

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:21.707
- And who is this honored man?
- A scribe.

01:35:23.178 --> 01:35:26.807
A Jewish scribe,
who claims to have saved the King's life.

01:35:30.485 --> 01:35:34.922
I should think you would be honored
by such a privilege given by the King.

01:35:35.023 --> 01:35:36.217
Honored?

01:35:41.730 --> 01:35:43.994
The prestige of Persia is at stake.

01:35:44.433 --> 01:35:46.958
What will it be said of your husband,
the king, that he commands

01:35:47.068 --> 01:35:49.730
his highest prince
to lead a Jew through the streets?

01:35:49.838 --> 01:35:51.430
A Jew, my lady!

01:35:52.441 --> 01:35:57.037
And how is a Jew
any different than you or I?

01:35:57.212 --> 01:35:58.338
They are our enemy.

01:35:59.648 --> 01:36:01.479
They must be destroyed.

01:36:02.684 --> 01:36:06.643
They may be your enemy, but not mine.

01:36:06.988 --> 01:36:09.388
From the way that you defend them,

01:36:11.426 --> 01:36:15.624
- one might almost think...
- One might think what,

01:36:17.599 --> 01:36:18.930
my prince?

01:36:26.041 --> 01:36:29.101
One might think. That is all, my lady.

01:36:31.546 --> 01:36:33.104
One might think.

01:36:40.622 --> 01:36:43.682
Make your way for Mordecai,
the Jew.

01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:48.987
Make your way for Mordecai,
who saved the King's life.

01:36:49.397 --> 01:36:52.560
He is the man in whom
the King delights to honor.

01:36:54.703 --> 01:36:58.264
All hail for Mordecai, the Jew,
honored of the King.

01:36:58.807 --> 01:37:02.834
Beloved of the Queen.
All hail for Mordecai, the Jew.

01:37:03.545 --> 01:37:07.242
Honored of the King.
Beloved of the Queen.

01:37:44.486 --> 01:37:45.646
Guards...

01:37:48.223 --> 01:37:51.124
My queen,
I bring you word from Mordecai.

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:53.118
You've run out of time.

01:37:55.697 --> 01:37:57.858
When the King leaves
for Greece tomorrow,

01:37:57.966 --> 01:38:00.491
he will appoint Haman as his regent.

01:38:01.970 --> 01:38:05.133
It is our last chance
to stop this edict of death.

01:38:06.141 --> 01:38:09.338
He made me vow to speak his words.

01:38:13.048 --> 01:38:16.815
You will indeed risk your life
if you go before the King...

01:38:17.652 --> 01:38:21.019
<i>...but do not think
that if you keep silent</i>

01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:25.826
<i>your position
will save you alone from this edict.</i>

01:38:26.761 --> 01:38:30.857
<i>For if you keep silent,
deliverance for the Jews</i>

01:38:31.533 --> 01:38:34.627
will arise from someplace else,

01:38:35.837 --> 01:38:36.997
but you

01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:40.135
will surely perish.

01:38:41.843 --> 01:38:45.939
Who knows whether
you have come to the palace

01:38:47.182 --> 01:38:48.979
for such a time as this?

01:38:55.156 --> 01:38:58.387
He said to give you this.

01:39:10.205 --> 01:39:13.663
Tell Mordecai to assemble the Jews.

01:39:14.876 --> 01:39:16.810
Ask them to fast and pray.

01:39:18.179 --> 01:39:19.874
I will do the same.

01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:25.310
And in the morning,
arrange for me a litter.

01:39:26.788 --> 01:39:31.248
I will array myself as queen
and go before the King unsummoned,

01:39:33.762 --> 01:39:36.196
even though it is against the law.

01:39:44.606 --> 01:39:46.096
And if I perish,

01:39:48.309 --> 01:39:49.537
I perish.

01:39:59.154 --> 01:40:02.419
People of Persia,
servants of the crown,

01:40:03.191 --> 01:40:05.489
today we embrace our destiny

01:40:06.127 --> 01:40:10.291
to raid and rule the world over
and stand against the Greeks

01:40:10.699 --> 01:40:13.293
and all who would rob us of our glory.

01:40:14.569 --> 01:40:16.196
Her crown, quickly.

01:40:17.172 --> 01:40:19.265
The litter will be here any moment.

01:40:21.376 --> 01:40:23.810
- No litter is coming.
- What?

01:40:24.446 --> 01:40:27.210
I do not know what you plan, but...

01:40:27.582 --> 01:40:30.210
The King leaves for the outpost
within the hour.

01:40:30.318 --> 01:40:32.286
I have not time to wait out this rain.

01:40:32.387 --> 01:40:35.288
I am not going to allow you
to kill yourself.

01:40:37.625 --> 01:40:38.683
No...

01:40:40.195 --> 01:40:43.790
- Please tell me you did not.
- What possible assurance do you have

01:40:43.932 --> 01:40:46.924
he would lower his scepter
to spare your life?

01:40:48.403 --> 01:40:52.362
You do not go into a bedroom of a man,
you go into the hall of a king.

01:40:52.974 --> 01:40:56.501
This is not you against him.
This is you against protocol.

01:40:56.945 --> 01:40:58.810
You against the empire.

01:41:00.014 --> 01:41:03.677
Then I... I go as

01:41:05.587 --> 01:41:09.455
David did
before Goliath and the Philistines.

01:41:14.596 --> 01:41:18.794
Those are just stories, Esther.
Do you hear me? Just stories.

01:41:21.236 --> 01:41:26.105
Know you what I love most
about the story of David and Goliath?

01:41:28.943 --> 01:41:33.277
David's victory
came not because he fought well

01:41:36.785 --> 01:41:39.777
but because he believed well.

01:41:41.122 --> 01:41:45.058
Thus I leave you on this day,
your regent, in my absence,

01:41:46.127 --> 01:41:48.687
Lord Haman, prince of the Fars.

01:41:49.931 --> 01:41:52.923
<i>It is my will
that each of you obey him in every way,</i>

01:41:53.034 --> 01:41:55.502
exactly as you would regard your king.

01:43:02.337 --> 01:43:04.897
Unsummoned she comes before the King.

01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.268
She does.

01:43:18.519 --> 01:43:20.384
Is protocol not broken?

01:43:23.591 --> 01:43:25.889
- Yes, protocol has been broken.
- Guards!

01:44:33.795 --> 01:44:35.262
...before the King.

01:45:06.761 --> 01:45:10.356
- We have not time to waste.
- What did he say to your request?

01:45:10.465 --> 01:45:13.400
The timing, the faces... I could not ask it.

01:45:13.935 --> 01:45:15.869
Not there, not in court.

01:45:16.237 --> 01:45:18.728
What then? Do we perish?

01:45:21.376 --> 01:45:24.777
We have but one last chance.
You must help me prepare.

01:45:25.279 --> 01:45:28.442
A king may lower his scepter
to whoever he wishes.

01:45:33.955 --> 01:45:34.979
My lord,

01:45:35.089 --> 01:45:38.991
this day your kingdom
has all but been ripped from your hands.

01:45:42.563 --> 01:45:46.226
This Esther has dishonored you
more than Vashti ever could.

01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:55.236
See not you now
how she has trapped you?

01:45:57.211 --> 01:46:00.112
Inviting us to a banquet
to hear her request?

01:46:02.016 --> 01:46:05.952
If you go,
the people will deem you to be a pawn.

01:46:07.388 --> 01:46:08.946
If you refuse,

01:46:10.591 --> 01:46:11.558
a coward.

01:46:15.263 --> 01:46:17.561
There is but one way to proceed.

01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:02.138
Is the meal to your satisfaction, my lord?

01:47:03.611 --> 01:47:05.738
The night draws late.

01:47:07.982 --> 01:47:10.314
Once more I ask for
your petition, my queen.

01:47:23.764 --> 01:47:25.095
My petition,

01:47:27.435 --> 01:47:28.663
my lord,

01:47:31.472 --> 01:47:34.168
is that you allow me to finish a story.

01:47:35.710 --> 01:47:38.076
One that I began many nights ago.

01:47:50.358 --> 01:47:52.451
The story of Jacob, my lord,

01:47:54.162 --> 01:47:57.029
does not finish with marrying Rachel.

01:47:57.131 --> 01:47:59.463
Well, they go on to have 12 sons.

01:47:59.567 --> 01:48:04.368
And like these 12 pillars that surround us,
they became the pillars of a people.

01:48:04.572 --> 01:48:05.834
Surely...

01:48:06.574 --> 01:48:10.908
Surely you do not delay an army
only to finish a children's tale?

01:48:22.557 --> 01:48:25.390
If I still find favor in your sight,

01:48:26.994 --> 01:48:31.021
let my life be given me, at my petition.

01:48:32.667 --> 01:48:34.498
And my people at my request.

01:48:34.602 --> 01:48:38.436
You demand of me your life
and that of your people?

01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:41.105
My dear girl,

01:48:42.376 --> 01:48:47.336
I know not of your people.
You have yet to tell me who they are.

01:48:47.615 --> 01:48:52.075
Had we been merely sold as slaves,
I would have held my tongue.

01:48:52.954 --> 01:48:56.390
This Haman wanted our blood,

01:48:57.124 --> 01:49:01.584
my blood, the blood of Jacob, your Jacob.

01:49:02.964 --> 01:49:05.432
Your Jacob was given a new name.

01:49:06.467 --> 01:49:07.627
Israel.

01:49:10.838 --> 01:49:12.601
As, too, was I.

01:49:13.541 --> 01:49:15.702
You, Esther?

01:49:17.311 --> 01:49:18.471
A Jew?

01:49:21.882 --> 01:49:23.873
Not Esther, my lord.

01:49:34.161 --> 01:49:37.062
Hadassah Bat-Abihail,

01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:41.566
daughter of the tribe of Benjamin,

01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:45.065
child of the most high God.

01:49:47.108 --> 01:49:50.839
Never have I heard
a more pathetic story in my entire life.

01:49:51.245 --> 01:49:52.712
She is no Jew.

01:49:53.447 --> 01:49:55.210
She's another Vashti.

01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:58.048
Seems it not convenient to you?

01:49:58.185 --> 01:50:00.016
An army marches,

01:50:00.821 --> 01:50:04.086
and suddenly she is a Jew.

01:50:08.663 --> 01:50:11.530
Esther is a Jew.

01:50:11.999 --> 01:50:14.900
Your Vashti but protested
the notion of war.

01:50:15.002 --> 01:50:19.564
This queen seeks to counter
the very authority of your rule.

01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:23.642
A Jew? If such were true,
why did she hide it till now?

01:50:23.744 --> 01:50:26.235
Pray, do tell us.

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:36.456
The Almighty has indeed ordained

01:50:36.957 --> 01:50:41.257
that my words speak not truth unto you.
At least allow my heart.

01:50:49.103 --> 01:50:50.331
For this

01:50:51.639 --> 01:50:55.666
which I have offered you,
my most precious in all the world,

01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:59.402
the very identity etched within me.

01:51:14.795 --> 01:51:16.660
Well, is something supposed
to be happening here?

01:51:20.134 --> 01:51:23.467
The stars... Do you not see them?

01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:34.909
Do you not see them?

01:51:40.921 --> 01:51:42.252
A mockery.

01:52:04.678 --> 01:52:07.579
Perhaps not how
you had hoped it would end?

01:52:09.483 --> 01:52:11.747
Imagined you that I would beg?

01:52:16.991 --> 01:52:19.221
Think you I will beg?

01:52:20.027 --> 01:52:21.585
Beg for my life?

01:52:21.929 --> 01:52:26.161
Beg like my forefather Agag
before your sword?

01:52:26.834 --> 01:52:29.234
Would you like me to beg for you?

01:52:41.348 --> 01:52:42.315
Oh,

01:52:44.919 --> 01:52:46.887
please, my lady.

01:52:50.925 --> 01:52:53.189
Please, Your Highness.

01:52:54.328 --> 01:52:58.128
Please spare me.

01:52:59.133 --> 01:53:03.627
Spare me my life. You are a lady of mercy.

01:53:04.338 --> 01:53:05.532
Spare me.

01:53:06.474 --> 01:53:09.272
I beg for forgiveness.

01:53:09.410 --> 01:53:13.972
Spare me, spare me, you Jew!

01:53:16.684 --> 01:53:19.175
Would he also assault the Queen,

01:53:19.954 --> 01:53:21.216
my wife,

01:53:23.324 --> 01:53:25.918
while I am in my house?

01:53:30.164 --> 01:53:34.498
Harbonah has informed me that
the gallows post stands in Haman's yard

01:53:34.635 --> 01:53:39.595
even as we speak. Apparently
intended for one Mordecai the Jew.

01:53:40.441 --> 01:53:41.965
Hang him on it.

01:53:42.877 --> 01:53:43.866
No!

01:53:44.311 --> 01:53:45.278
No!

01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:56.781
What made you come back?

01:53:59.226 --> 01:54:00.420
I saw them.

01:54:05.399 --> 01:54:06.991
I saw the stars.

01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:24.848
<i>Thus with one faithful act</i>

01:54:24.952 --> 01:54:28.581
<i>has a new generation redeemed
the time of centuries past</i>

01:54:28.756 --> 01:54:30.849
<i>and stepped into their destiny.</i>

01:54:30.991 --> 01:54:35.121
On this day, I give you your new prince,
and master of audiences,

01:54:36.297 --> 01:54:37.628
Mordecai Ben-Yair.

01:54:37.965 --> 01:54:40.866
On the day appointed for their destruction,

01:54:41.335 --> 01:54:44.327
all Jews shall have the right

01:54:44.772 --> 01:54:46.467
to protect themselves

01:54:46.574 --> 01:54:50.601
and shall be entitled to take
all the property of their attackers.

01:54:51.946 --> 01:54:54.039
<i>And I send forth this story</i>

01:54:54.148 --> 01:54:57.481
<i>enjoining all to keep a day
of feasting and gladness.</i>

01:54:57.585 --> 01:55:02.284
<i>A celebration to be passed on and retold
through every generation,</i>

01:55:02.389 --> 01:55:04.220
<i>to be known as Purim,</i>

01:55:04.325 --> 01:55:07.726
<i>or the casting of the Pur
that determined its time.</i>

01:55:08.662 --> 01:55:13.031
<i>While we continue onward in the face
of a world filled with uncertainty,</i>

01:55:13.167 --> 01:55:17.035
<i>we can rejoice,
for hidden within its mysteries</i>

01:55:17.638 --> 01:55:19.970
<i>is the honor of a king.</i>

01:55:20.541 --> 01:55:24.033
<i>Thus dictated, I order this decree sent out</i>

01:55:24.178 --> 01:55:27.011
under the great seal of Mordecai,

01:55:27.648 --> 01:55:29.275
prince of Persia,
