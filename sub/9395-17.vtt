01:45.765 --> 01:46.620
Ready?

01:47.373 --> 01:53.179
You can’t shoot. You can’t score. You will beat us nevermore. Go Ravens Go…

01:53.230 --> 01:55.909
I guess you should feel pretty lucky you get to hang out with me like this.

01:56.010 --> 01:57.818
Do you have any other wishes I can grant?

01:58.126 --> 01:59.272
- Yeah.
- What?

02:00.082 --> 02:02.057
Why don’t you come to the tournament this weekend.

02:02.794 --> 02:05.160
Ugh. Alright. Yeah. You’re on.

02:05.232 --> 02:05.985
- Alright?
- Yeah.

02:06.184 --> 02:06.818
Alright.

02:07.671 --> 02:09.306
Thank you, genie. Catch you later.

02:10.417 --> 02:11.181
How’s it going?

02:11.791 --> 02:15.242
Well, in a startling new development, it looks like I’m going to be joining you at the classic.

02:15.319 --> 02:18.037
You and me in the same hotel? This weekend just got interesting.

02:18.099 --> 02:19.121
Down boy.

02:19.670 --> 02:23.239
Plus it’s probably better if I don’t leave you with all those cheerleaders anyway.

02:23.764 --> 02:25.108
So how’d it go?

02:25.533 --> 02:28.156
- I got the apartment.
- Ah, that’s great.

02:28.396 --> 02:31.949
I drained my savings, paid first and last month’s rent. It’s mine on Sunday.

02:32.072 --> 02:32.896
So cool!

02:35.852 --> 02:42.562
Okay. Theresa, terrible posture. Pinch that penny.

02:44.010 --> 02:49.254
Bevin, you need… a breath mint.

02:52.112 --> 02:54.675
Peyton. Nice form.

02:55.116 --> 02:57.256
And excellent betrayal of a best friend.

02:58.455 --> 03:02.449
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. You guys!

03:02.873 --> 03:07.201
This weekend is the Classic. It’s our biggest cheer competition.

03:07.292 --> 03:11.793
Aren’t you sick of Claire Young and Bear Creek Warriors taking home the trophy every year?

03:11.942 --> 03:16.647
Because I am. We need to get it together here and I’m not just talking about our routine.

03:16.677 --> 03:20.425
I’m talking hair, nails… underarms, Theresa.

03:20.506 --> 03:22.731
Brooke, cheerleading is supposed to be fun.

03:22.790 --> 03:24.715
Yeah? Well winning’s funner.

03:25.058 --> 03:27.547
And if you don’t like it you can go cheer for the wrestling team.

03:28.578 --> 03:29.569
Take five.

03:31.438 --> 03:36.328
Okay, you know what? You hate me, I get it. Fine. Just don’t take it out on our squad.

03:36.385 --> 03:38.693
Everything is not about you, Peyton.

03:39.196 --> 03:43.194
Did you ever think that maybe I’m being a psycho-hose-beast because I want us to do well this weekend?

03:43.282 --> 03:46.225
Those judges are not going to be as forgiving as I am.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.370
Funny, I didn’t know you were forgiving at all.

03:52.297 --> 03:53.382
Hey, Lips! Come here.

03:54.786 --> 03:55.902
It’s Mouth.

03:56.025 --> 03:58.733
I know. You’re going to be at the Classic this weekend, right?

03:58.800 --> 04:00.919
Ravenshoops.com, never miss a game.

04:01.410 --> 04:03.136
How’d you like to be my scout?

04:03.326 --> 04:06.117
Scope out the competition for me and I’ll pay you 20 bucks.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.857
Spy on cheerleaders?

04:08.922 --> 04:12.409
- I’ll do it for free.
- Really? Excellent.

04:12.465 --> 04:15.179
- Break’s over, girls.
- You said five minutes.

04:15.241 --> 04:17.088
Yeah well cry me a river. Let’s go.

04:23.817 --> 04:25.568
Lucas! Come in here.

04:28.051 --> 04:28.988
What’s up, Coach?

04:29.510 --> 04:30.553
How’s that shoulder?

04:31.394 --> 04:32.880
Therapy’s going kind of slow.

04:33.032 --> 04:36.790
Well, that’s too bad. We could use you this weekend.

04:36.868 --> 04:39.494
Ah come on, man. The Greyhounds suck on D.

04:39.854 --> 04:41.578
We’ll get your 500th win easy, Coach.

04:42.485 --> 04:43.841
Just wish I could do my part.

04:44.266 --> 04:47.004
Well, maybe you can.

04:48.132 --> 04:51.271
One of your teammates needs a little extra coaching.

04:52.075 --> 04:54.046
Okay. Sure, I’ll help whoever.

04:57.092 --> 04:59.292
- You wanted to see me?
- I did.

05:00.441 --> 05:04.793
With Lucas on the injured list, you’re going to see a lot more double teams.

05:05.290 --> 05:09.200
Now Lucas is damn good at creating space for open shots.

05:09.617 --> 05:11.397
I want you two to work together.

05:11.526 --> 05:14.054
There’s nothing he can teach me about my game or anything else.

05:14.142 --> 05:17.244
He can teach you to listen when I tell you to do something.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.135
I’d start now if I were you.

05:30.787 --> 05:33.997
You know, if those countertops get any cleaner we’re not going to need plates.

05:34.904 --> 05:35.846
Sorry.

05:36.746 --> 05:41.314
But how terrible of a mother am I that my own son wants to divorce me.

05:41.580 --> 05:43.398
Deb, you’re not mommy dearest.

05:43.670 --> 05:46.935
Nathan’s hurt but he’ll forgive you. It’s just going to take some time.

05:49.007 --> 05:49.808
Keith.

05:49.906 --> 05:51.784
Hey. Karen.

05:52.675 --> 05:55.323
I just wanted to get a cup of coffee to go.

05:55.978 --> 05:58.682
Oh sure. We haven’t seen you in a while.

05:59.003 --> 06:01.017
Yeah, I’ve been pretty busy at work.

06:01.927 --> 06:03.714
- Well that’s good.
- Yep.

06:06.197 --> 06:09.013
Okay, thanks. See you, Deb.

06:10.560 --> 06:11.137
Karen.

06:11.512 --> 06:12.736
Keith.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.622
Why don’t you come by some night for dinner.

06:17.538 --> 06:18.598
Like we used to.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.744
How about tomorrow night?

06:23.040 --> 06:23.805
Okay.

06:24.226 --> 06:24.768
Okay.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.407
Baby steps.

06:30.385 --> 06:34.751
Karen. Deb. So glad I found two booster moms in one place.

06:34.926 --> 06:38.064
Look, Judy Johnson backed out of the classic at the last minute

06:38.213 --> 06:40.277
and I need a fill in chaperone.

06:42.334 --> 06:45.129
Oh, I have a meeting with my attorney. I can’t cancel.

06:45.186 --> 06:47.808
I heard about you and Dan. How awful.

06:48.449 --> 06:51.843
So… Karen? How was Italy?

06:51.965 --> 06:54.095
You know we really missed you at the silent auction.

06:54.299 --> 06:56.973
And the pancake breakfast, and the bake sale, and...

06:57.019 --> 06:58.474
Okay, when does the bus leave?

07:00.956 --> 07:03.650
Hey, Matt. What are you doing?

07:03.896 --> 07:05.197
Making room for the new equipment.

07:05.325 --> 07:08.129
Hey, don’t let this guy get away with half days cause he’s related to the boss.

07:08.821 --> 07:10.834
Oh my God, I thought one of you was bad enough.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.397
That jumpsuit looks good on you, Keith. How’s your day going?

07:13.492 --> 07:18.571
Well let’s see. You changed my sign, you make me wear this monkey suit,

07:18.748 --> 07:20.458
and you’re replacing all my equipment.

07:20.797 --> 07:22.824
What’s next? You going to start fixing bicycles too?

07:22.880 --> 07:26.158
If it would turn a profit. Remember, Dan Scott is a name people trust.

07:26.204 --> 07:28.128
Yeah, maybe people don’t know him.

07:28.349 --> 07:32.318
Listen, this equipment in this place is obsolete anyway, I feel like I’m stuck in 1982 in here.

07:32.358 --> 07:35.241
- The machines work fine.
- Not as good as the new ones.

07:35.409 --> 07:38.916
Now I told you I was going to help you with your shop. This is part of the agreement.

07:39.085 --> 07:41.145
You got to start thinking like a business man, bro.

07:41.205 --> 07:44.036
I think you do enough of that for the both of us. Bro.

07:51.728 --> 07:54.333
If Whitey wants you to feel like you’re part of the team, fine, I just...

07:55.344 --> 07:57.759
I don’t understand why I have to baby-sit you.

07:57.994 --> 07:59.586
He just wants to make sure you’re going to be able to get open.

07:59.639 --> 08:03.816
- I don’t have a problem with getting open.
- Well you will with me out of the line up. Okay?

08:04.400 --> 08:06.950
The Fade-away is a great shot for creating space.

08:07.984 --> 08:10.692
- You want to work on it or what?
- I don’t need to work on it.

08:11.655 --> 08:13.611
Okay, show me. Come on.

08:20.410 --> 08:21.347
Try it again.

08:22.821 --> 08:25.805
I’ll tell you what. I’ll hit your fade-away, when you can do this.

08:31.133 --> 08:31.941
Thought so.

08:33.312 --> 08:35.443
Nathan, the point is you’re not going to be able to do that.

08:36.097 --> 08:36.799
Excuse me?

08:36.866 --> 08:39.113
You’re not going to be able to get to the rack like that. You’ll be double teamed.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.688
You know what? I don’t need your coaching.

08:45.168 --> 08:47.648
Just watch me get to the rack this weekend.

08:53.664 --> 08:56.931
Well, I just don’t want you to think I’m trailing you like some paranoid mother.

08:57.039 --> 08:58.087
- But you are.
- Ohh.

08:58.574 --> 08:59.244
It’s cool.

09:02.148 --> 09:03.322
Silent treatment.

09:04.007 --> 09:05.020
Like a mime.

09:07.063 --> 09:10.811
Okay, with the way you drive this thing we could have gotten there in 45 minutes

09:10.857 --> 09:12.640
and not had to deal with this whole bus mess.

09:12.681 --> 09:16.152
Yeah but I’ve got to embarrass you as much as possible in front of your friends.

09:16.453 --> 09:17.652
Make up for lost time.

09:18.533 --> 09:21.129
- Which one are you dating again?
- Try no one.

09:21.573 --> 09:23.641
- Larry Sawyer meet Karen Roe.
- Hi.

09:23.733 --> 09:25.941
You two are my chaperones.

09:26.059 --> 09:30.410
A lot of these kids think that the Classics is an excuse to party all weekend.

09:30.483 --> 09:32.699
It’s your job to see that that doesn’t happen.

09:32.966 --> 09:35.618
Oh we don’t have a prayer. I used to be one of these kids.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.692
You? I’ve got a beer bong in my over night bag.

09:37.938 --> 09:40.645
I don’t care how important this tournament is,

09:40.806 --> 09:45.633
people trump pom-poms. We can’t fit all that crap on the bus.

09:45.760 --> 09:49.242
Fine! You be responsible for ten very pissed off cheerleaders.

09:49.294 --> 09:51.259
Coach, if we’re short on room I can drive.

09:51.326 --> 09:54.782
- No, no, no, forget it.
- Why not? I can fit all that crap in my trunk.

09:58.346 --> 10:02.340
Alright. But you stay right behind the bus.

10:03.723 --> 10:04.399
Thanks.

10:04.823 --> 10:06.344
Sweet. Come on, Hales.

10:07.086 --> 10:08.969
Oh, uh, Lucas is saving me a seat.

10:10.035 --> 10:12.647
What are you in third grade? Come on, we’ll ride in style.

10:18.028 --> 10:20.429
Hey, um, I’m going to ride with Nathan. Is that cool?

10:20.823 --> 10:22.446
Yeah, no problem.

10:30.072 --> 10:34.904
Listen up. We’ve got a team meeting in the conference room right after dinner.

10:34.965 --> 10:36.860
Lights out at nine o’clock.

10:37.316 --> 10:39.697
Consider your room assignments final.

10:43.737 --> 10:44.780
You’ve got to be kidding me.

10:45.983 --> 10:51.124
Alphabetical order. Scott. Scott. Unalterable.

10:53.852 --> 10:55.467
You should have changed your name.

11:22.093 --> 11:23.365
I was listening to that.

11:23.777 --> 11:24.629
Not anymore.

11:25.186 --> 11:26.146
Watching TV.

11:31.974 --> 11:32.930
Not anymore.

11:38.910 --> 11:41.407
So which bed do you want? The window or the door?

11:41.808 --> 11:42.585
Whatever.

11:42.865 --> 11:44.548
Brooke, can we just make the best of this?

11:44.699 --> 11:48.315
Fine. But I’m not doing it for you, I’m doing it for the squad.

11:48.811 --> 11:50.138
Call it a cheer truce.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.843
Bam Chica Da Na.

12:05.134 --> 12:07.731
So you ladies order room service?

12:13.496 --> 12:17.166
God. Good to have an escape route incase she tries to smoother me with her pillow.

12:17.907 --> 12:18.693
How you doing?

12:19.974 --> 12:21.089
Jenny withdrawal.

12:21.340 --> 12:25.298
Yeah. No but you need a weekend away, just to relax and have a good time.

12:25.763 --> 12:27.171
Doesn’t happen too often.

12:27.458 --> 12:31.354
That’s true, but, there’s been some new developments.

12:31.421 --> 12:33.024
Oh really? What are they?

12:34.273 --> 12:36.311
Peyton, it’s an emergency, get in here.

12:36.419 --> 12:38.108
Ugh. Sorry.

12:38.573 --> 12:40.919
Cheer Nazi calls. See ya.

12:43.791 --> 12:45.537
Guess who’s in the lobby, I’ll tell you.

12:45.593 --> 12:48.554
Claire Young and her little hoe posy. We are going down there.

12:48.600 --> 12:52.055
Okay. And if an angry dance-off breaks out I got your back.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.462
Great. Just don’t stick another knife in it.

12:54.559 --> 12:58.402
Theresa, I want you to hit those pits and cover that zit. Points off for complexion.

12:58.504 --> 12:59.689
Let’s go.

13:09.895 --> 13:10.862
Hi, Claire.

13:12.501 --> 13:15.014
We just wanted to wish you good luck this weekend.

13:15.363 --> 13:18.234
Um, we’ve won four years in a row.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.572
Including Claire for best choreography.

13:20.792 --> 13:23.815
Yeah so maybe you should keep your luck for yourself.

13:24.097 --> 13:27.113
By the way. Who are you again?

13:28.265 --> 13:32.499
You know who I am. Brooke Davis. Captain of the Tree Hill Ravens.

13:32.761 --> 13:34.859
We roomed together last summer at spirit camp.

13:35.396 --> 13:36.789
Right, right.

13:37.495 --> 13:39.611
Don’t the Ravens lose every year?

13:41.383 --> 13:42.124
See ya.

13:47.646 --> 13:49.609
Oh it is so on.

13:56.609 --> 13:57.936
You scared me.

13:58.130 --> 14:01.110
Well, we’re not allowed to have girls in the room so I had to keep it covert.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.075
- Hang out for a little bit.
- Oh I can’t.

14:03.122 --> 14:06.066
I’ve got to meet Lucas for pizza in the lobby. I think I’m already late.

14:06.128 --> 14:09.362
So be later. We’ve got a whole hotel room to ourselves.

14:15.701 --> 14:17.929
Sorry, I thought we had plans.

14:18.123 --> 14:20.064
- We do.
- Naw, just do your thing.

14:20.684 --> 14:22.102
I’m sorry. Lucas.

14:23.617 --> 14:26.259
Luke. Will you just wait...

14:26.376 --> 14:28.910
Haley. It’s cool. Okay?

14:30.476 --> 14:32.474
Go be with your boyfriend.

14:38.464 --> 14:40.835
- Hello?
- Hey, Keith, it’s me.

14:41.167 --> 14:42.131
Oh hey, Karen.

14:42.469 --> 14:46.683
Look one of the booster moms trapped me into chaperoning the Classics,

14:46.719 --> 14:51.029
so now I’m in Charlotte. Um, can I get a rain check on dinner?

14:51.076 --> 14:56.334
Oh, sure. We’re pretty backed up at the shop so I was going to have to cancel anyway.

14:56.375 --> 14:59.196
Okay, well, I’ll see you when I get back.

14:59.796 --> 15:00.900
Hope so.

15:02.146 --> 15:03.688
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

15:10.554 --> 15:15.028
I cannot believe the nerve of that little third rate Britney trying to pretend like she doesn’t recognize me.

15:15.069 --> 15:18.279
Are you still obsessing over this? You made out with her boyfriend at camp.

15:18.329 --> 15:20.834
I didn’t know they were dating, unlike some people.

15:20.896 --> 15:23.512
And besides he was a yell leader, he was gay anyway.

15:23.619 --> 15:26.691
Hey, ladies. We’re sneaking out after curfew, spread the word okay?

15:26.752 --> 15:30.956
Tim, stay away from my squad we need to be fresh for tomorrow.

15:30.997 --> 15:31.786
Okay.

15:33.337 --> 15:35.820
Theresa I thought I told you to lay off the chocolate.

15:36.097 --> 15:38.555
- It’s a really good thing I have an acne medicine.
- Brooke this isn’t acne.

15:38.600 --> 15:45.415
It’s chicken pox. Karen called my parents. I’m out. Thank God.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.330
Okay, could this get any worse?

15:50.402 --> 15:53.547
Brooke, it’s okay. We’ll rework the routine.

15:53.612 --> 15:55.840
It’s perfectly crafted for ten girls.

15:55.901 --> 15:57.652
Okay, so we’ll find a replacement.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.727
Great idea, genius. Who are we going to ask?

16:01.244 --> 16:02.317
No way!

16:02.470 --> 16:05.845
Haley, come on. Do you remember when I made you those flyers for open mic night?

16:05.905 --> 16:07.934
That is weak, you’re a born artist.

16:08.035 --> 16:12.554
I’m a born klutz, okay? I almost drowned in the balls at chucky cheese.

16:12.608 --> 16:15.143
Okay but if we don’t find a replacement we’re going to have to forfeit.

16:15.194 --> 16:18.660
Don’t you guys, like, lose every year since grade school anyway? What’s the big deal?

16:18.855 --> 16:20.426
It’s important to Brooke.

16:21.946 --> 16:24.446
Do you know how terrible it is to be disconnected from your best friend?

16:25.646 --> 16:27.277
Look I really hurt Brooke.

16:27.496 --> 16:29.936
And I just don’t want her to be disappointed again.

16:32.254 --> 16:33.504
Hey, Matt, how’s it going?

16:33.567 --> 16:36.422
Good, we’re just about to close up. We’ll finish the rest tomorrow.

16:36.485 --> 16:39.931
Not tomorrow. Tonight. We’ve got a whole new slate tomorrow. What’s taking so long?

16:40.442 --> 16:43.150
We’re just getting up to speed on the new equipment.

16:44.947 --> 16:47.911
Uh huh. I’m sure you are. Thanks.

16:50.389 --> 16:51.705
Hey, Keith, how’s it going?

16:52.329 --> 16:56.022
Great. Just finished my taxes and I’m about to download some tunes.

16:56.511 --> 16:59.647
You know, the junior college offers manufacturers training.

16:59.979 --> 17:01.209
Might help you learn the system.

17:01.377 --> 17:04.132
It’s not about the system, Dan, it’s about the mechanic.

17:04.804 --> 17:06.077
A car is still a car.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.882
Anyone who drop out who takes high school shop knows more about these machines than you do.

17:10.373 --> 17:11.736
You should really think about enrolling.

17:11.858 --> 17:14.423
You should really think about stepping three feet back.

17:16.262 --> 17:18.279
If you had gone to college in the first place,

17:18.488 --> 17:21.018
you might not have to get your hands dirty at all.

17:25.355 --> 17:27.335
- Well, I think that’s everybody.
- Yeah.

17:27.371 --> 17:28.565
8:59, that’s not bad.

17:28.682 --> 17:32.518
Yeah, except for that Tim kid peeing in the ice machine, this was easy.

17:32.737 --> 17:35.513
Too easy. Think we should check again at ten?

17:35.840 --> 17:37.818
You want to grab a cup of coffee in about a half hour?

17:37.959 --> 17:39.659
Sounds like it’s going to be a late night.

17:40.009 --> 17:42.296
- Yeah. I’ll meet you downstairs.
- Alright.

17:59.248 --> 18:01.001
Just leave the cake and go.

18:01.439 --> 18:04.437
Well we’re safe. All the other girls have had chicken pox.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.413
Theresa always was a beat behind.

18:10.640 --> 18:11.503
How you doing?

18:14.753 --> 18:15.778
Pretty crappy.

18:17.073 --> 18:21.574
I put all my energy into this competition and it made me feel really good for a few days.

18:22.306 --> 18:25.721
Took my mind off everything, but now I’m just back to square one.

18:25.944 --> 18:30.007
You know, we haven’t had a chance to talk since you and Lucas broke up.

18:31.286 --> 18:32.495
I’m really sorry.

18:33.340 --> 18:34.361
His loss, right?

18:34.665 --> 18:35.803
He probably knows that.

18:37.383 --> 18:43.052
And I know it doesn’t seem like it, but I bet you and Peyton will get through this too.

18:45.931 --> 18:50.533
And now, from a former Ravens cheer captain to another,

18:50.584 --> 18:53.072
I think you have taken these girls too far to give up.

18:53.416 --> 18:57.441
Our routine is for ten girls, Karen. Without Theresa we’re only nine,

18:57.522 --> 18:59.545
so unless I can pull a cheerleader out of my ass...

18:59.616 --> 19:02.775
Hey. Haley said she’d fill in for Theresa.

19:03.815 --> 19:07.050
I make no apologies for my lack of coordination, it’s genetic.

19:07.762 --> 19:08.719
It’s impossible.

19:09.820 --> 19:11.280
Brooke, you’re a captain.

19:12.099 --> 19:16.477
We can still do it. You just need to get off your ass and stop pouting.

19:17.055 --> 19:18.504
We’d have to practice all night.

19:20.394 --> 19:22.825
And it’s past curfew.

19:24.066 --> 19:26.722
If anyone asks, I was never here.

19:29.964 --> 19:32.108
Okay. Okay.

19:32.318 --> 19:36.137
I’m going to get the rest of the girls. We’re going to need coffee, black, sleep is our enemy.

19:36.255 --> 19:38.985
And we’re going to need to do something about that hair.

19:40.785 --> 19:41.784
Let’s go.

19:46.798 --> 19:48.016
So I thought you were hanging out with Haley.

19:48.078 --> 19:50.699
Yeah, me too. She’s probably hanging with Nathan.

19:50.931 --> 19:51.584
Tim.

19:53.070 --> 19:53.745
Or not.

19:54.574 --> 19:56.612
We’re good. Whitey’s in for the night.

19:57.787 --> 20:00.534
So you ladies finally escaped psycho Brooke, huh?

20:01.624 --> 20:03.826
Psycho Brooke told you to leave her squad alone.

20:05.768 --> 20:06.842
Raven’s we’re back on.

20:07.023 --> 20:07.994
Come on, Brooke.

20:09.888 --> 20:12.781
Sad state of affairs when our own cheerleaders ditch us.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.679
Not really. I know this club.

20:15.111 --> 20:19.424
They’re a little loose on checking ID’s. That’s not the only thing that’s loose.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.378
Tim, just say it’s a strip club.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.446
How are we going to get in?

20:23.503 --> 20:25.740
Everybody chips in ten bucks and I grease the bouncer.

20:25.786 --> 20:27.496
And after that you can bribe him.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.195
5...6...7...8.

20:36.648 --> 20:40.450
No, no, no. Tutor girl. It’s feet together, apart, then clap.

20:40.598 --> 20:42.627
Okay, I’m really trying.

20:42.677 --> 20:44.326
Try harder cause we’re on in 12 hours.

20:45.043 --> 20:50.470
Aw, cute routine, girls. Too bad those moves are so ‘03.

20:50.957 --> 20:53.239
Where’d you find your choreographer anyway?

20:53.630 --> 20:56.399
In the yellow pages? Under ‘S’ for Sucks?

20:56.460 --> 20:59.529
No, actually that’s where I found your boyfriend.

20:59.604 --> 21:03.102
Oh, you know if I were you, I’d get some beauty sleep.

21:03.475 --> 21:05.565
I think it’s the only thing that’s going to help.

21:05.704 --> 21:08.800
If I were you, I’d step back from my friend.

21:10.828 --> 21:16.951
Whatever. Oh and remember, ladies. Jazz fingers!

21:21.997 --> 21:23.883
I’ll give her a jazz finger.

21:25.051 --> 21:28.557
Well, she’s obviously scared cause their routine probably sucks.

21:28.679 --> 21:30.674
Actually it’s good. I’ve seen it.

21:31.819 --> 21:32.594
How good?

21:32.751 --> 21:34.365
Lots of spins. Some tumbles.

21:34.431 --> 21:38.809
Okay, no, give me information I can use, Mouth. What are the moves exactly?

21:38.952 --> 21:40.049
First they do this.

22:13.824 --> 22:16.641
That is good. Do you want to replace tutor girl?

22:17.297 --> 22:18.652
No, thanks.

22:19.017 --> 22:22.273
Oh and by the way, three other team are using Junior-Senior.

22:24.367 --> 22:25.084
Okay.

22:25.953 --> 22:29.344
Okay, it’s time for plan B, we’re going to find Claire Young’s room and pull a Tonya Harding.

22:29.380 --> 22:30.978
We’re just going to hit her in the knee with a big stick.

22:31.017 --> 22:34.530
Okay Brooke. You’re a better choreographer than Claire has ever been. Okay?

22:34.571 --> 22:38.503
We still have time to win it, just teach us some new moves.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.020
Well what about our song?

22:42.072 --> 22:45.400
You handle the moves. Let me take care of the song.

22:52.125 --> 22:54.482
I got to hand it to you Tim, for once.

22:58.033 --> 22:58.887
Vodka?

22:59.357 --> 23:00.126
Water.

23:00.822 --> 23:02.854
Although the last couple of days I’ve been tempted.

23:04.134 --> 23:04.851
Tough week?

23:05.690 --> 23:06.495
Yeah.

23:08.058 --> 23:10.206
Jenny’s mom popped up unannounced.

23:10.359 --> 23:12.383
Wow. How’d that go?

23:12.443 --> 23:17.948
Oh, not good. But you now what, I don’t really want to talk about her.

23:17.994 --> 23:23.078
I don’t really get nights like this too often, so she’s not going to ruin it.

23:24.291 --> 23:26.396
What’s going on with you? Brooke? Peyton?

23:26.468 --> 23:28.004
Nothing anymore.

23:28.879 --> 23:30.338
And then there’s Nathan and Haley.

23:31.898 --> 23:34.880
Haley could be with anybody and I’d be happy for her. I mean even…

23:36.541 --> 23:39.150
Tim. But Nathan...

23:39.508 --> 23:42.957
Luke, I mean Nathan is not my favorite guy but I don’t know,

23:44.091 --> 23:46.666
if Haley sees something in him, there’s probably something there.

23:47.081 --> 23:48.761
She’s got pretty good taste in people, right?

23:48.884 --> 23:50.886
Welcome to the Peppermint Zebra.

23:53.118 --> 23:54.788
Is something a little off about this crowd?

23:55.008 --> 23:56.993
It’s ladies night!

24:06.922 --> 24:08.576
5...6...7...8...

24:08.656 --> 24:13.224
1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...

24:13.311 --> 24:17.693
1 and 2...3...4...5...6...7...8.

24:17.843 --> 24:20.305
Okay. Bevin, I want you to go into a high kick.

24:20.816 --> 24:23.392
- Tutor girl, I want you to do a diagonal.
- What’s a diagonal?

24:25.252 --> 24:25.834
Thank you.

24:26.508 --> 24:29.285
Alright, alright. Ripped and burned. It’s a remix.

24:29.517 --> 24:31.533
Trust me, nobody else is going to have this.

24:32.205 --> 24:33.197
This better be good.

24:33.955 --> 24:34.784
You’re welcome.

24:36.011 --> 24:38.911
We get this right to the music, I’ll spring for escorts, guys.

24:47.478 --> 24:48.818
Hey. Hotel’s this way.

24:49.516 --> 24:50.962
Yeah I’m just gonna go check out the gym.

24:52.439 --> 24:53.515
Hey you mind if I come?

24:54.436 --> 24:55.588
Uh yeah. Whatever.

25:00.675 --> 25:02.366
I’m gonna wipe this place up tomorrow.

25:02.922 --> 25:06.314
My dad’s not going to be here so I figured I’d go for season high just to piss him off.

25:06.591 --> 25:07.941
Where is he this weekend, anyway?

25:07.993 --> 25:11.189
The lawyers told him to skip a game. Show he’s not controlled by basketball.

25:11.533 --> 25:13.923
So he bought a satellite dish to bring in the live feed.

25:14.655 --> 25:16.129
Man, I wish I was out there.

25:17.681 --> 25:19.428
The way I feel like I'll be back.

25:19.473 --> 25:22.919
There’s always other sports. You don’t need arms to suck at soccer.

25:23.927 --> 25:26.549
I busted my elbows once a couple of summers ago.

25:27.439 --> 25:29.094
I was playing again in like six weeks.

25:29.656 --> 25:30.623
What’s the secret?

25:30.922 --> 25:34.761
There is no secret. You just start shooting one day and deal with the pain.

25:35.770 --> 25:37.749
Somewhere along the line it will get easier.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.170
So you been working on your fade-away?

25:42.379 --> 25:44.014
Fade-away’s soft, man.

25:45.237 --> 25:48.949
Look if the game is on the line and the rock is in my hand, I’m going to the hole.

25:49.103 --> 25:50.776
Every time, that’s my game.

25:57.510 --> 25:59.245
How’d you get him to open the hot tub?

25:59.548 --> 26:01.222
I sweet talked the night manager.

26:01.493 --> 26:04.781
I figured you guys could use it after reworking our entire routine tonight.

26:05.088 --> 26:06.172
Feels good doesn’t it.

26:06.388 --> 26:07.795
Yep. This is great.

26:09.776 --> 26:10.607
Ta Da.

26:12.037 --> 26:14.339
Tutor Girl you look bitchin’.

26:14.841 --> 26:16.147
Yeah I kind of do, don’t I?

26:17.017 --> 26:18.757
Now get your suit. Hot tub therapy.

26:19.505 --> 26:20.381
Both of you.

26:22.828 --> 26:23.473
Haley?

26:25.430 --> 26:27.646
I’m kind of filling in for Theresa.

26:28.078 --> 26:30.462
Works for me. I got a thing for cheerleaders.

26:30.523 --> 26:31.041
Oh yeah?

26:53.879 --> 26:56.001
They needed an extra. What do you think?

26:56.339 --> 26:58.443
I think you look kind of ridiculous.

26:59.744 --> 27:02.601
You do realize that both your former girlfriends are cheerleaders.

27:02.933 --> 27:05.693
Oh right, excuse me. I guess I’m not allowed to have any fun.

27:05.884 --> 27:06.615
That’s not it.

27:07.204 --> 27:10.302
Yeah, that is it. I’m having a good time, I’m happy.

27:10.736 --> 27:13.084
I’d think that my friends would be happy for me too.

27:13.195 --> 27:14.140
Haley get in!

27:15.895 --> 27:17.091
Nathan stop it!

27:33.401 --> 27:38.811
How in the hell am I going to win a ball game with a bunch of hung over idiots?

27:39.185 --> 27:44.801
I don’t know why you got on the damn bus in the first place if you weren’t going to take this serious.

27:45.815 --> 27:48.637
You call yourselves chaperones.

27:49.947 --> 27:51.277
It’s pathetic.

28:08.969 --> 28:11.005
Dude, you got to be kidding me.

28:12.566 --> 28:13.684
It’s 4 A.M.

28:14.174 --> 28:16.074
If I go to sleep now I’ll never wake up.

28:16.130 --> 28:17.896
I’ll be a total waste for the game tomorrow.

28:20.288 --> 28:24.595
It’s classic basketball. I’d give you next but you’d probably hurt yourself again.

28:24.696 --> 28:26.104
What is Whitey doing?

28:27.057 --> 28:29.878
Putting us together on the court and in this room.

28:29.986 --> 28:30.876
He’s just bored.

28:32.054 --> 28:32.719
And evil.

28:33.252 --> 28:36.021
You know, when I was younger I always wanted a little brother.

28:37.548 --> 28:40.169
Then I found out about you. Got over that in a hurry.

28:46.441 --> 28:48.188
What have you been doing to Haley, man?

28:49.539 --> 28:50.982
You were kind of a dick to her tonight.

28:51.367 --> 28:53.763
You know, she used to be this totally original…

28:55.371 --> 28:59.083
Haley. Then you came along.

28:59.784 --> 29:02.916
And as far as I can tell she’s still the same person she’s always been.

29:03.230 --> 29:04.991
The only difference is now she’s with me.

29:06.814 --> 29:08.615
So maybe the problem’s not with her.

29:09.327 --> 29:10.649
Maybe the problem’s with you.

29:20.474 --> 29:24.131
Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the Secret Sparkle Classic.

29:24.402 --> 29:27.268
First up, The Bear Creek Warriors.

29:28.112 --> 29:33.628
1...2...3...4. Bear Creek, Warriors.

29:33.869 --> 29:40.894
Champions to beat let’s hear it. Better than the Ravens. You’ll see.

30:18.146 --> 30:22.033
Four time champions Bear Creek Warriors. Led by captain Claire Young.

30:29.166 --> 30:32.129
Okay. I want you guys to think about Theresa.

30:32.621 --> 30:36.864
Lying at home, itchy, and gross and covered in calamine lotion.

30:37.402 --> 30:40.056
The last thing she said to me was, “This Sucks”.

30:40.393 --> 30:42.974
And this will suck unless we win.

30:43.783 --> 30:48.719
Next up at this year’s Sparkle Classic by Secret, the Tree Hill Ravens.

30:52.221 --> 30:55.144
5...6...7...8. RAVENS!

30:56.077 --> 30:56.674
Peyton.

30:57.729 --> 31:02.025
I just want to say thanks, for your help with Haley and the music.

31:02.077 --> 31:04.769
It’s important to you. So it’s important to me too.

31:05.392 --> 31:05.942
Come on.

31:08.408 --> 31:09.675
Let’s Go!

31:11.727 --> 31:13.853
The one, and only.

31:14.319 --> 31:16.699
Blue, black and white.

31:17.165 --> 31:19.653
The best of the best.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.485
That’s right.

32:29.418 --> 32:30.440
Haley.

32:32.554 --> 32:34.413
- That’s great.
- Can you believe?

32:34.465 --> 32:35.856
- You did awesome.
- Thank you.

32:38.673 --> 32:44.290
And second place this year goes to the New Hanover Wild Cats.

32:48.409 --> 32:53.798
And first place in this years Sparkle Classic by Secret goes to…

32:55.184 --> 33:00.475
The Bear Creek Warriors. Five years in a row. Way to go.

33:04.476 --> 33:07.283
Can I borrow you car, hose, and your garage?

33:07.499 --> 33:10.301
Brooke you did a great job. Okay? We all though so.

33:10.403 --> 33:11.671
Not good enough.

33:12.362 --> 33:18.133
And our final award of the competition, for best original choreography, goes to…

33:19.306 --> 33:23.365
Brooke Davis. Captain and Choreographer of the Tree Hill Ravens.

33:23.505 --> 33:24.271
That’s you!

33:28.550 --> 33:29.393
Congratulations.

33:29.601 --> 33:30.303
Thank you.

33:31.974 --> 33:32.807
Yeah Brooke.

33:33.870 --> 33:38.270
And we want to thank all of this years cheering teams on behalf of Secret

33:38.308 --> 33:43.042
and their entire sparkle collection. Thanks for making this years Classics a success.

33:43.252 --> 33:44.588
And Cheer on.

33:51.072 --> 33:51.707
Hey.

33:52.496 --> 33:53.019
Hey.

33:54.514 --> 33:55.925
You were really amazing out there.

33:56.454 --> 33:59.525
Yeah? I thought maybe I looked ridiculous.

34:02.882 --> 34:03.545
Look.

34:05.122 --> 34:06.197
So I was thinking.

34:07.375 --> 34:09.438
Things have been different since you started dating Nathan.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.155
I don’t spend anymore time with him than you did with Brooke.

34:13.212 --> 34:16.827
I know. I know and he’s… your boyfriend.

34:16.898 --> 34:19.377
Of course you’ll want to be with him. It’s just...

34:20.770 --> 34:22.100
I guess I miss my friend.

34:23.257 --> 34:28.228
Luke. I miss you too.

34:28.966 --> 34:33.190
But have you thought about how hard this is on my juggling the two of you guys?

34:34.121 --> 34:37.507
Luke, you’re really important to me. I care about you.

34:37.563 --> 34:39.498
But Nathan is important to me too.

34:39.851 --> 34:44.121
And if you want to be a part of my life, eventually, sooner or later,

34:44.204 --> 34:46.436
you’re gonna have to be a part of his too.

34:46.687 --> 34:47.333
You’re right.

34:51.532 --> 34:54.326
Alright well the game starts in a minute. Want to sit together?

34:54.357 --> 34:55.728
- Hell Yes!
- Alright.

34:56.875 --> 35:01.427
Oh I’m sorry! I am sorry.

35:02.036 --> 35:02.789
It’s okay.

35:04.536 --> 35:07.331
Fifteen seconds to go, the Tree Hill Ravens are down by one

35:07.387 --> 35:09.865
and could be on the brink of their first loss this season.

35:09.932 --> 35:12.164
Tim, you’re in bound to Nathan up top.

35:12.523 --> 35:15.615
We’re going spread offense. Nathan you find your open shot.

35:15.696 --> 35:19.465
If you can’t we’ll go with Jake. At least he’s not hung over.

35:19.921 --> 35:23.567
Let’s go fellas, come on. Raven’s on three. 1...2...3... Ravens!

35:27.025 --> 35:29.735
Get out the Tupperware folks. If the Raven’s don’t score

35:29.771 --> 35:32.705
we’ll have to save Coach Durham’s 500th win cake for another night.

35:32.761 --> 35:33.791
Go Nathan!

35:34.201 --> 35:37.063
Fifteen seconds left and the Ravens need a basket to win it.

35:37.262 --> 35:40.180
The inbound to Nathan Scott and he is immediately double teamed.

35:40.375 --> 35:43.181
He’s gonna have to give it up. He does. Finds Tim Smith.

35:43.304 --> 35:45.981
Tim with the ball. The time is running down. Back to Nathan.

35:46.110 --> 35:49.238
Eight seconds now. Now seven. Nathan dribbles and tries to drive

35:49.279 --> 35:50.646
but he can’t get through the double team.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.462
He’s gonna have to do something. Three seconds. Now two.

35:53.636 --> 35:56.924
Nathan spins up top and puts up the fade-away. It’s Good!

35:59.570 --> 36:04.639
Unbelievable! In a season of impossible finishes, Nathan Scott nailed the fade-away jumper.

36:04.685 --> 36:08.172
The Ravens reign undefeated and Coach Durham’s won 500 games.

36:08.551 --> 36:11.244
Hey. Were you rooting for Nathan?

36:12.248 --> 36:13.814
I was rooting for the team.

36:14.305 --> 36:16.082
Whatever you say.

36:33.846 --> 36:36.910
I make this shot, you get your asses back to work.

36:45.550 --> 36:46.515
Let’s go.

36:48.464 --> 36:52.481
Hey. I expect this from Keith but you’re supposed to be me when I’m not here.

36:52.978 --> 36:53.812
Get back to work.

36:55.626 --> 36:58.466
Why don’t you just lighten up, Dan? We were taking a break.

36:58.543 --> 37:00.080
Well break’s over, Axel Rose.

37:00.755 --> 37:04.001
You never had a strong work ethic. If you did, it would still be your name up on that sign.

37:04.262 --> 37:06.345
You know what? I’m done.

37:06.612 --> 37:07.882
We close shop at six.

37:07.955 --> 37:11.179
No, I’m taking Nathan’s lead and I’m getting the hell away from you.

37:11.518 --> 37:12.588
What is the matter with you?

37:13.627 --> 37:17.102
I do everything I can to help you keep your business and all you do is give me attitude.

37:17.145 --> 37:19.372
And all you do is lorded over me.

37:22.607 --> 37:25.940
Well thanks for the help, Dan. But I don’t want it anymore.

37:26.232 --> 37:28.671
You can take the shop. I quit.

37:31.860 --> 37:34.333
- Thank you so much.
- Alright.

37:38.531 --> 37:41.848
Hey Mouth. Part of this belongs to you, you know.

37:42.243 --> 37:44.435
Well we could share it. Trade off weeks?

37:44.507 --> 37:46.396
Uh, let me think about it… No.

37:46.913 --> 37:48.152
- Bye.
- Bye.

37:49.232 --> 37:51.981
Brooke. Hey. You’re uniform.

37:52.238 --> 37:54.525
It didn’t fit all that well anyways, so.

37:55.222 --> 37:58.034
You really saved us this weekend. Thanks, Haley.

38:01.796 --> 38:03.323
Did she just call me Haley?

38:06.651 --> 38:08.601
You know I would have hit that shot with or without you.

38:09.307 --> 38:10.779
Not if I was guarding you.

38:11.473 --> 38:13.075
Get your ass back and we’ll see.

38:14.029 --> 38:15.396
- Alright.
- Hey guys.

38:18.688 --> 38:19.763
This is a first.

38:20.684 --> 38:22.754
Haley! Hey what’s up?

38:22.902 --> 38:23.460
Hey.

38:23.885 --> 38:26.353
- Who’s that?
- I have no idea.

38:26.742 --> 38:29.498
Well I guess that’s a first too. Alright I’ll see you guys later.

38:29.571 --> 38:30.520
Okay. Bye.

38:31.021 --> 38:31.529
Bye.

38:33.642 --> 38:35.708
Hear that? He said you guys.

38:35.749 --> 38:38.913
Easy, match maker. So I’m headed back to the apartment.

38:39.363 --> 38:41.211
You sure you don’t want to get that cheerleading uniform back?

38:41.267 --> 38:42.051
Shut up!

38:48.268 --> 38:51.507
Okay. Is my dad flirting with your mom?

38:51.942 --> 38:53.566
Could he be any more obvious?

38:55.318 --> 38:56.607
This is too weird.

38:58.384 --> 38:59.213
Yeah, weird.

39:15.082 --> 39:16.976
Think Claire Young is still in shock?

39:17.295 --> 39:20.598
Look, Peyton, it was really fun to get caught up in the weekend

39:20.650 --> 39:22.489
and forget about all the crap between us.

39:22.591 --> 39:23.457
Yeah, it was.

39:23.974 --> 39:25.705
But it doesn’t change what you did.

39:26.841 --> 39:30.237
Okay? We’re not friends anymore, we’re just on the same squad.

39:32.115 --> 39:35.688
Brooke, you might not be my friend, but I’m still yours.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.628
And I’m going to prove it to you.

39:41.034 --> 39:42.012
I’ll see ya.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.369
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:16.030 --> 40:19.188
- I’m sorry that I missed our dinner.
- Oh you must be Keith.

40:19.543 --> 40:20.095
Hi.

40:20.366 --> 40:24.467
This is Larry Sawyer. He’s Peyton’s dad. We chaperoned together this weekend.

40:24.540 --> 40:28.627
More like Whitey chaperoned us. She’s trouble if you keep her up after midnight.

40:30.198 --> 40:32.963
So how was your weekend? We miss anything in Tree Hill?

40:33.341 --> 40:34.088
Not really.

40:37.185 --> 40:38.220
You want some coffee?

40:38.323 --> 40:43.432
You know I just remembered I have to... pick up an oil filter so...

40:43.489 --> 40:44.528
It was nice to meet you Larry.

40:45.501 --> 40:46.145
See ya.

42:04.707 --> 42:05.937
That’s one.
