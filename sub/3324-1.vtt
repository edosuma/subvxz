00:02.462 --> 00:03.793
Previously on "Teen Wolf":

00:03.963 --> 00:06.079
It was too dark to see much,
but I'm pretty sure it was a wolf.

00:06.299 --> 00:07.038
A wolf bit you?

00:07.258 --> 00:09.169
- Is this a party or a date?
- Maybe both.

00:09.385 --> 00:10.716
- And her name is...
- Allison.

00:11.721 --> 00:12.380
Who are they?

00:12.597 --> 00:14.462
Hunters. The kind that have
been hunting us for centuries.

00:14.682 --> 00:15.842
That's my dad.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.133
Lydia, run!

00:22.106 --> 00:23.437
I'm the Alpha now.

00:23.649 --> 00:26.391
It's my turn to get what I want.

02:43.205 --> 02:44.866
No, dad! Dad!

02:45.041 --> 02:46.827
He saved our lives! Your life!

02:47.043 --> 02:48.032
You can't do this!

02:48.210 --> 02:51.543
Dad, let him go! Please let him go,
and I'll do whatever you want!

02:51.714 --> 02:53.750
Okay? I swear.
I won't see him again.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.789
I promise, ever again, dad.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.174
Please, dad, please.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.047
Please! Please!

03:03.225 --> 03:05.511
Never again.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.296
How much time do we have?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.848
They'll be gone an hour.

04:30.563 --> 04:33.350
Just like that. No, no, you first.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.603
Me first?

04:44.702 --> 04:46.909
You want help
getting in the shower?

04:48.080 --> 04:50.662
Maybe if t was four.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.870
And still taking bubble baths.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.831
Right, I'll just wait outside then.

04:57.006 --> 04:59.713
Where it's slightly less sarcastic.

05:08.601 --> 05:10.307
He's been here all night.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.927
He's been here all weekend.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.226
You're dirty.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.233
Sorry.

06:07.326 --> 06:09.533
- That's okay.
- l'll fix it.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.747
Okay, that was your fault.

06:23.926 --> 06:24.961
Sorry.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.462
Do the right-side brakes on your
dad's SUV squeak a little bit?

06:29.640 --> 06:31.301
- Yeah.
- Then we're dead.

06:31.517 --> 06:33.178
Oh, my God. Hurry. Hurry.

06:38.774 --> 06:41.265
If you don't trust me enough
to let me have a lock on my door,

06:41.443 --> 06:44.355
- the least you can do is knock.
- Did I interrupt something?

06:44.572 --> 06:45.812
Just my studying.

06:46.031 --> 06:50.024
My life, my... happiness...
will to live.

06:50.202 --> 06:52.534
I picked up your dress for
the funeral tomorrow.

06:52.705 --> 06:54.616
You can just put it on my desk.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.296
Can I go back to studying now?

07:04.466 --> 07:06.548
Or would you like to do a
full body cavity search?

07:07.052 --> 07:08.087
Mom.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.131
Mom!

08:11.075 --> 08:12.690
Seriously? Come...

08:39.269 --> 08:40.258
Just...

08:40.437 --> 08:42.052
It's not gonna work.

09:59.683 --> 10:00.638
Lydia?

10:01.185 --> 10:02.265
Lydia!

10:02.644 --> 10:04.680
- What the hell was that?
- Lydia?

10:33.842 --> 10:34.957
Lydia?

10:40.474 --> 10:44.183
- Naked? As in nude?
- I'm pretty sure they mean the same thing,

10:44.353 --> 10:47.015
but, yes, as far as we know,
she left here clothing-optional.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.430
- You checked the whole hospital, right?
- Every last corner.

10:49.650 --> 10:52.437
- Nothing suspicious?
- Nothing. She just took off.

10:52.611 --> 10:55.318
All right, let's get an APB out
on a 16-year-old redhead.

10:55.489 --> 10:58.652
- Any other descriptors?
- 5'3", green eyes, fair-skinned,

10:58.826 --> 11:01.784
- and her hair is actually strawberry blonde.
- Is that right?

11:01.954 --> 11:04.411
- Yeah.
- Come here.

11:04.581 --> 11:08.699
- What the hell are you still doing here?
- Providing moral support?

11:08.877 --> 11:13.041
How about you provide your ass
back home, where you should be.

11:13.215 --> 11:15.206
- Okay, I can do that too.
- Yeah.

11:18.137 --> 11:20.219
We're gonna find her,
so don't worry.

11:28.564 --> 11:31.306
This is the one
she was just wearing?

11:31.525 --> 11:34.562
I'm not gonna let anyone hurt her.
Not again.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.899
All right, just shove the thing
in your face and let's find her.

11:38.991 --> 11:40.276
Wow!

11:41.368 --> 11:43.324
What are you doing here?
Someone's gonna see us.

11:43.495 --> 11:46.578
I don't care. She is my best friend,
and we need to find her before they do.

11:46.748 --> 11:50.036
- I can find her before the cops can.
- How about before my father does?

11:50.210 --> 11:51.620
- He knows?
- Yeah.

11:51.837 --> 11:55.455
ljust saw him and three other
guys leave my house in two SUVs.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.169
- Search party.
- It's more like a hunting party.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.594
Get in.

12:07.603 --> 12:10.015
All right, but if she's turning,
would they actually kill her?

12:10.189 --> 12:11.725
I don't know.
They won't tell me anything.

12:11.899 --> 12:15.141
Okay, all they say is, "We'll talk after
Kate's funeral, when the others get here."

12:15.319 --> 12:17.275
- What others?
- They won't tell me that, either.

12:17.446 --> 12:20.563
Okay, your family's got some serious
communication issues to work on.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.697
Scott, are we going the right way?

12:24.536 --> 12:25.821
Take the next right!

13:42.155 --> 13:43.611
What the hell?

15:30.931 --> 15:32.296
Need a hand?

15:47.989 --> 15:49.775
She came here?

15:49.950 --> 15:51.065
You sure?

15:51.785 --> 15:53.946
Yeah, this is where the scent leads.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.330
All right, but has
Lydia ever been here?

16:03.505 --> 16:04.836
Not with me.

16:11.555 --> 16:15.548
Maybe she came here on instinct,
like she was looking for Derek.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.184
You mean looking for an Alpha.

16:20.355 --> 16:22.391
Wolves need a pack, right?

16:23.525 --> 16:24.685
Not all of them.

16:24.860 --> 16:27.727
But would she have been
drawn to an Alpha?

16:27.904 --> 16:30.611
Is it an instinct to
be part of a pack?

16:30.782 --> 16:33.444
Yeah, we're stronger in packs.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.529
Like strength in numbers.

16:36.371 --> 16:41.411
No, like, literally stronger,
faster, better in every way.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.827
That the same for an Alpha?

16:48.758 --> 16:51.090
That'll make Derek stronger too.

16:56.141 --> 16:58.257
Ooh, hey, look at this.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.425
You see this?

17:01.813 --> 17:03.849
I think it's a tripwire.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.355
- Stiles...
- Yeah, buddy?

17:09.529 --> 17:10.609
Oh.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.401
Next time you see a tripwire...

17:15.410 --> 17:16.741
don't trip it.

17:17.245 --> 17:18.746
Yeah, noted.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.785
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:23.168 --> 17:25.124
Someone's coming. Hide!

17:26.546 --> 17:27.877
Go!

17:45.190 --> 17:46.179
Scott?

17:46.608 --> 17:47.563
Mr. Argent.

17:47.776 --> 17:49.641
How are you doing?

17:49.861 --> 17:52.523
Good. You know, just hangin' out.

17:53.865 --> 17:56.026
Is this one of yours?
It's, uh, good.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.066
Nice design. Very constricting.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.827
What are you doing
out here, Scott?

18:00.997 --> 18:03.784
- Looking for my friend.
- Ah, that's right.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.491
Lydia's in your group
now, isn't she?

18:07.212 --> 18:09.703
Part of the clique?
Is that the word you use?

18:09.965 --> 18:12.206
Or is there another way to put it?

18:13.051 --> 18:16.543
- Part of your pack?
- Actually, clique sounds about right to me.

18:16.721 --> 18:19.758
I hope so. 'Cause I know
she's a friend of Allison's,

18:19.933 --> 18:22.800
and one special circumstance,
such as yourself--

18:22.978 --> 18:25.936
one, I can handle.
Not two.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.398
No.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.986
Scott, do you know what
a hemicorporectomy is?

18:32.153 --> 18:34.280
l have a feeling
I don't want to.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.735
A medical term for amputating
somebody at the waist.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.404
Cutting them in half.

18:40.620 --> 18:45.956
Takes a tremendous amount of strength to
cut through tissue and bone like that.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.749
Let's hope a demonstration
never becomes necessary.

19:04.436 --> 19:05.676
You okay?

19:05.854 --> 19:08.971
It's just another life-threatening
conversation with your dad.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.269
Stiles, help me with this.

19:19.743 --> 19:20.949
Thanks.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.864
But I think I got it.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.195
Yeah.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.247
Comin'?

19:42.891 --> 19:44.301
It's Lahey.

19:44.476 --> 19:45.841
Isaac Lahey.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.267
You work for your father, Isaac?

19:48.438 --> 19:49.644
When he's not in school.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.063
Which is where he needs
to be in 20 minutes.

19:52.275 --> 19:53.685
Yeah, I understand that.

19:53.902 --> 19:57.394
But I've got a missing teenage girl,
and our K-9 unit led us here.

19:57.572 --> 19:59.858
She's not wearing any clothes,
and if she's out here tonight,

20:00.033 --> 20:03.070
- and the temperature really drops...
- I'm sorry, I didn't see anything.

20:03.244 --> 20:07.157
Trust me, if he saw a naked girl
outside a computer screen,

20:07.332 --> 20:08.868
he'd remember.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.619
How'd you get that
black eye, Isaac?

20:14.964 --> 20:17.091
- School.
- School fight?

20:17.258 --> 20:18.714
Nah, lacrosse.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.672
Lacrosse?
You play for Beacon Hills?

20:21.846 --> 20:23.427
- Yeah.
- My son plays for the team.

20:23.598 --> 20:24.963
Well, I mean, he's on the team.

20:25.183 --> 20:28.596
He doesn't technically play.
Not yet, anyway. It's, uh...

20:34.359 --> 20:37.442
- Something wrong, Isaac?
- No. Oh, no, sorry.

20:37.612 --> 20:41.696
I was just remembering, I actually
have a morning practice to get to.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.402
Just one more question.

20:43.618 --> 20:46.075
You guys get many
grave robberies here?

20:46.746 --> 20:47.826
A few.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.249
Usually, they just take
stuff like jewelry.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.408
What'd this one take?

20:52.627 --> 20:54.083
Her liver.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.058
- She ate the liver?
- No, I didn't say she ate it.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.689
I just said it was missing.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.270
And you know what?
Even if she did, so what?

21:18.445 --> 21:22.063
- It's the most nutritious part of the body.
- I never ate anyone's liver.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.946
Yeah, right, 'cause when it
comes to werewolves,

21:24.117 --> 21:26.403
you're a real model of self-control.

21:26.578 --> 21:27.818
Actually, wait--hold on.

21:27.996 --> 21:30.703
You're the test case for this, so we
should be going over what happened to you.

21:30.874 --> 21:32.080
What do you mean?

21:32.250 --> 21:34.866
I mean like what was going through your
mind when you were turning, you know?

21:35.044 --> 21:37.126
What were you drawn to?

21:37.797 --> 21:38.877
Allison.

21:39.048 --> 21:41.710
Okay, nothing else? Seriously?

21:41.885 --> 21:44.001
Nothing else mattered.

21:44.179 --> 21:46.090
But, no, that's good, though, right?

21:46.264 --> 21:49.256
'Cause the night that Lydia
was bit, she was with you.

21:49.434 --> 21:52.471
Yeah, but she was
looking for... Jackson.

22:09.913 --> 22:11.449
Nice car.

22:13.291 --> 22:16.408
Here's a dollar. Go find
another parking lot to die in.

22:17.712 --> 22:19.043
Security!

22:20.840 --> 22:23.001
Let's go!
I have an announcement.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.713
Gather round. Quicker!

22:25.887 --> 22:27.297
Danny, put a shirt on.

22:27.472 --> 22:29.258
Stilinski, that means you!

22:29.432 --> 22:32.014
Let's go, gather round.
Listen up.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.471
Police are asking for help
on a missing child advisory.

22:34.646 --> 22:38.104
It's a sick girl,
roaming around, totally naked.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.311
Now, it's supposed to get
below 40 degrees tonight.

22:41.486 --> 22:43.568
I don't know about you,
but the last time it was that cold

22:43.738 --> 22:46.320
and I was running around naked...

22:47.158 --> 22:49.740
I lost a testicle to exposure.

22:49.953 --> 22:52.569
Now, I don't want the same thing
happening to some innocent girl.

22:52.747 --> 22:55.284
So police are organizing
search parties for tonight.

22:55.458 --> 22:59.667
Sign up, find the missing girl,
you get an automatic "A" in my classes.

23:01.089 --> 23:04.206
If Lydia wants to take a naked hike
in the woods, why should I care?

23:04.384 --> 23:09.469
Because we have a pretty good idea
that she might be... you know, turning.

23:10.682 --> 23:13.594
- Turning?
- Yeah. Turning.

23:13.768 --> 23:15.554
Into...

23:17.730 --> 23:20.016
A unicorn.
What do you think, dumbass?

23:20.191 --> 23:23.979
Well, I think that if Lydia's turning,
she's not the one that's gonna need help.

23:24.153 --> 23:27.111
- What do you mean?
- Oh, God, you've got it all backwards, McCall.

23:27.282 --> 23:30.615
When I was with Lydia, you should have
seen the scratch marks she left on me.

23:30.785 --> 23:34.027
What do you think she's gonna do
with a set of real claws?

23:47.010 --> 23:50.423
All right, it's causing me severe mental
anguish to say this, but he's right.

23:50.597 --> 23:51.712
I know.

23:51.723 --> 23:54.681
What if the next body part she steals
is from someone who's still alive?

23:54.851 --> 23:57.433
This is a pop quiz,
Mr. Stilinski.

23:57.604 --> 24:00.391
If I hear your voice again, I may be
tempted to give you detention

24:00.565 --> 24:02.897
for the rest of your high school career.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.604
- Can you do that?
- Well, there it is again.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.109
Your voice.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.522
Triggering the only impulse
I've ever had to strike a student

24:10.700 --> 24:13.362
repeatedly and violently.

24:14.078 --> 24:16.535
I'll see you at 3:00 for detention.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.572
- You too, Mr. McCall?
- No, Sir.

24:25.423 --> 24:27.038
Dude... your nose.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.047
You okay?

24:54.160 --> 24:56.697
Oh, I'm fine, Danny.
Just go back to class.

25:01.626 --> 25:03.287
Just give me a second, okay?

25:07.382 --> 25:09.714
I said give me a frickin' second!

25:18.059 --> 25:19.139
Derek.

25:21.020 --> 25:24.183
You're looking a little pale there, Jackson.
You feeling okay?

25:25.233 --> 25:26.894
Never better.

25:27.610 --> 25:30.693
If something's wrong,
I need to know.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.728
You're with me now.

25:32.907 --> 25:34.898
Wait... With you?

25:35.076 --> 25:37.408
Me with... With you?

25:37.578 --> 25:39.489
What am I, your little pet?

25:39.664 --> 25:43.657
I mean, just because you gave me "the bite"
doesn't mean I'm part of your little wolf pack.

25:43.835 --> 25:47.373
Sorry, but to be honest, you don't exactly
show outstanding leadership qualities.

25:47.839 --> 25:49.375
Is that so?

25:49.549 --> 25:51.380
Look, I've got my own agenda.

25:51.551 --> 25:53.382
Which doesn't involve running
around the woods at night,

25:53.553 --> 25:55.418
howling at the moon with
you and McCall, okay?

25:55.596 --> 25:57.382
So why don't you just back the--

26:00.977 --> 26:02.433
What is it?

26:02.603 --> 26:04.264
What's happening?

26:06.024 --> 26:07.935
Body's fighting the bite.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.277
Why?

26:14.949 --> 26:16.280
I don't know.

26:16.534 --> 26:17.899
What does it mean?

26:21.330 --> 26:22.831
What does it mean?!

27:00.369 --> 27:01.745
Nice dress.

27:03.706 --> 27:05.287
Nice camera.

27:08.836 --> 27:12.328
Not her sister, her aunt.
The one who murdered all those people.

27:12.507 --> 27:15.169
You mean the crazy bitch
who killed all those people?

27:15.343 --> 27:17.550
Yeah, the fire, all those animal attacks--
it was her aunt.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.427
Are you kidding?
I sit next to her in English.

27:20.598 --> 27:22.213
Find a new seat.

27:36.447 --> 27:38.108
How'd you know?

27:38.282 --> 27:40.739
I could hear your heartbeat.
What is it?

27:40.910 --> 27:43.697
I-I-I can't--
I can't do this.

27:43.871 --> 27:46.738
I can't go to the funeral.

27:46.916 --> 27:49.282
Everyone is going
to be watching me,

27:49.460 --> 27:51.701
and there are going to be
cameras there, and I can't--

27:51.879 --> 27:53.289
Yes, you can.

27:54.423 --> 27:56.334
Allison, you'll be fine.

27:58.511 --> 28:00.342
Everything's gonna be okay.

28:00.513 --> 28:04.131
We're gonna find Lydia,
and it's all gonna be good.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.887
Just think about it--
No Peter.

28:07.103 --> 28:09.515
No psycho werewolf killings.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.142
Your dad and me.

28:12.817 --> 28:14.899
Well, that's a work in progress.

28:18.114 --> 28:20.355
I can't go and be like this.

28:23.119 --> 28:25.451
Aren't you supposed
to cry at funerals?

28:26.247 --> 28:27.362
For her.

28:27.915 --> 28:29.325
It doesn't matter.

28:30.501 --> 28:33.868
You know, you could be...
crying for you, you know?

28:34.380 --> 28:36.086
You lost someone.

28:37.049 --> 28:41.042
Mary Kate wasn't totally who you
thought she was, but you still lost her.

28:41.762 --> 28:42.717
Yeah.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.049
You'll be fine.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.014
I'll make sure.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.136
- I'll be there.
- What?

28:52.648 --> 28:54.809
I'll figure it out.
Okay, I'll be there.

28:54.984 --> 28:58.226
Not... right next to you.
But I'll be there.

29:00.364 --> 29:01.319
Okay.

29:07.330 --> 29:08.661
You first.

29:41.405 --> 29:42.520
Sit.

29:42.698 --> 29:45.610
- Well, but it's been an hour.
- My detention's an hour and a half.

29:45.785 --> 29:47.446
You can't do that.

29:48.829 --> 29:51.662
Oh... but I can.

29:53.417 --> 29:58.662
You see, Stiles, since your father was
so judicious in his dealings with me,

29:58.839 --> 30:02.457
I've decided to make you my personal
project for the rest of the semester.

30:02.635 --> 30:08.050
You are going to benefit from all the
best that strict discipline has to offer.

30:08.224 --> 30:13.764
Now... sit down, before I decide
to keep you here all night.

30:29.245 --> 30:32.863
Mrs. Argent, can we get a few words?
Just a few words!

30:33.165 --> 30:35.076
A few words, Mrs. Argent!

30:35.251 --> 30:37.537
Hold 'em, hold 'em, hold 'em.
That's it!

30:38.129 --> 30:41.417
- I knew this was a bad idea.
- Well, it wasn't my idea.

30:42.425 --> 30:46.418
I tried telling him.
But he insisted on making a point of it.

30:46.595 --> 30:49.257
Well, if he insisted, then he can
deal with this when he gets here.

30:49.432 --> 30:50.797
Who gets here?

30:51.517 --> 30:53.599
Just sit down, sweetheart.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.085
This looks expensive.

31:25.509 --> 31:27.591
Yeah, 900 bucks.

31:27.762 --> 31:29.798
And how expensive is this?

31:57.041 --> 31:58.656
Christopher.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.040
Gerard.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.924
I'm so sorry.

32:22.691 --> 32:24.022
Yo.

32:27.738 --> 32:29.353
Do you remember me?

32:32.827 --> 32:34.658
Who the hell is that?

32:39.417 --> 32:41.078
He's definitely an Argent.

32:43.003 --> 32:45.085
Considering I haven't seen
you since you were three,

32:45.256 --> 32:48.214
I don't suppose I can assume
you'd call me grandpa.

32:49.343 --> 32:53.302
So if it's comfortable,
call me Gerard for the time being.

32:54.390 --> 32:56.597
But I'd prefer grandpa.

33:06.235 --> 33:09.022
Hey, you know, maybe they're
just here for the funeral. I mean...

33:09.196 --> 33:11.357
what if they're the
non-hunting side of the family?

33:11.574 --> 33:14.782
There could be non-hunting Argents.
It's possible, right?

33:14.952 --> 33:16.692
I know what they are.

33:18.038 --> 33:19.903
They're reinforcements.

33:23.210 --> 33:25.747
Ah. The two of you.

33:25.963 --> 33:27.248
Unbelievable.

33:27.465 --> 33:29.831
- Pick up my tie.
- Got it. Sorry.

33:30.009 --> 33:31.840
I know, I'm supposed to ask.

33:33.929 --> 33:36.306
- 4-1-5 Adam.
- I didn't copy that.

33:36.474 --> 33:39.762
Did you say 4-1-5 Adam?

33:39.935 --> 33:41.596
Disturbance in a car.

33:41.770 --> 33:43.681
They were taking a heart
attack victim--D.O.A.

33:43.856 --> 33:46.347
But on the way to the hospital,
something hit 'em.

33:46.525 --> 33:49.267
- What... hit the ambulance?
- Copy that.

33:49.445 --> 33:52.812
I'm standing in front of it right now.
Something got in the back.

33:52.990 --> 33:55.481
There's blood everywhere.
And I mean everywhere.

33:55.659 --> 33:58.446
- All right, Unit 4, what's your 20?
- Route 5 and post.

33:58.621 --> 34:00.577
I swear, I've never seen
anything like this.

34:00.748 --> 34:03.114
All right, take it easy.
I'm on my way.

34:03.959 --> 34:06.041
Now, as for you two...

34:25.022 --> 34:27.308
What the hell is Lydia doing?

34:30.069 --> 34:31.184
I don't know.

34:32.196 --> 34:34.778
What kept you from doing that,
was it Allison?

34:34.949 --> 34:36.405
Ihopeso.

34:41.247 --> 34:42.953
Do you need to get closer?

34:48.254 --> 34:49.835
No, I got it.

34:56.637 --> 34:59.549
Just... ljust need you to find her.

35:00.766 --> 35:01.972
All right?

35:02.184 --> 35:05.301
Please, just... just find her.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.350
I will.

35:58.574 --> 35:59.939
You're not Lydia.

36:17.217 --> 36:18.593
Wait!

36:27.853 --> 36:29.218
Just...

36:31.857 --> 36:33.142
Lydia?

36:36.320 --> 36:37.560
Lydia?

36:40.157 --> 36:41.863
Lydia!

36:46.288 --> 36:50.827
Well... is anyone
gonna get me a coat?

36:58.300 --> 37:00.416
Jesus. Yep, here you go.

37:01.053 --> 37:02.213
Wait!

37:05.307 --> 37:06.387
Stop!

37:22.825 --> 37:25.191
- What are you doing? I can help him.
- They're already here.

37:25.411 --> 37:27.026
- I can help him!
- Quiet!

38:02.406 --> 38:03.816
Who are you?

38:05.492 --> 38:07.528
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

38:08.537 --> 38:10.653
Nothing, I swear.

38:10.873 --> 38:12.989
You're not from here, are you?

38:14.293 --> 38:16.284
- Are you?!
- No.

38:17.546 --> 38:21.539
No, I came-- I came
looking for the Alpha.

38:21.717 --> 38:23.253
I heard he was here.
That's all.

38:23.844 --> 38:25.300
Look, I didn't do anything.

38:26.054 --> 38:27.590
I didn't hurt anyone.

38:27.765 --> 38:29.426
No one living.

38:29.600 --> 38:32.387
He wasn't alive
in the ambulance.

38:32.561 --> 38:34.051
He wasn't, I swear.

38:34.229 --> 38:35.730
Gentlemen!

38:36.940 --> 38:39.773
Take a look at a rare sight.

38:41.069 --> 38:43.481
You wanna tell them
what we've caught?

38:43.697 --> 38:46.279
- An Omega.
- The lone wolf!

38:46.992 --> 38:49.825
Possibly kicked out
of his own pack.

38:49.995 --> 38:53.613
Or the survivor of a pack
that was hunted down.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.697
Maybe even murdered.

38:56.502 --> 39:00.336
And possibly alone
by his own choice.

39:01.840 --> 39:05.003
Certainly not a wise choice.

39:21.193 --> 39:24.060
Because, as I am
about to demonstrate...

39:27.658 --> 39:31.276
an Omega rarely survives...

39:32.621 --> 39:34.282
on his own.

39:43.590 --> 39:45.205
Look. Look.

39:45.384 --> 39:46.965
Look at them!

39:47.135 --> 39:49.091
You see what they do?

39:50.305 --> 39:52.387
This is why you need me.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.219
Why we need each other.

39:54.434 --> 39:57.016
The only way to fight
them is together.

39:58.564 --> 40:00.225
What are they doing?

40:02.568 --> 40:04.559
Declaring war.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.236
We have a code.

40:11.243 --> 40:13.950
Not when they
murder my daughter.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.789
No code. Not anymore.

40:19.960 --> 40:23.999
From now on, these things are just
bodies waiting to be cut in half.

40:24.172 --> 40:25.161
Are you listening?

40:27.342 --> 40:30.800
Because I don't care if
they're wounded and weak.

40:36.643 --> 40:39.100
Or seemingly harmless...

40:39.313 --> 40:41.178
begging for their life

40:41.356 --> 40:45.395
with the promise that they will
never, ever hurt anyone.

40:49.239 --> 40:52.857
Or some desperate, lost soul...

40:53.035 --> 40:56.402
with no idea
what they're getting into.

40:58.248 --> 40:59.624
We find them.

40:59.791 --> 41:00.780
We kill them.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.211
We kill them all.
