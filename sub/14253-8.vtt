WEBVTT

00:06.939 --> 00:09.272
Ares lVto Kumagawa.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.503
How was the sunrise
from down there?

00:11.578 --> 00:12.943
Beautiful.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.743
There was a little green
mixed in today.

00:15.815 --> 00:18.215
lt was really quite spectacular.

00:18.284 --> 00:20.343
Sorry l missed it.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.047
Next time, Lieutenant.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.556
Any luck drilling
through that lava plain?

00:24.624 --> 00:25.886
Roger that.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.586
We broke through
the iron oxide barrier,

00:27.660 --> 00:28.922
and we're down to eight meters.

00:28.995 --> 00:31.122
We should have some samples

00:31.197 --> 00:32.926
by the end of the day
if all goes well.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.660
On to more important matters.

00:34.734 --> 00:36.463
Received an uplink from Houston.

00:36.569 --> 00:38.901
The Yankees won game five
of the World Series.

00:38.972 --> 00:40.200
You owe me 20 bucks.

00:40.306 --> 00:41.273
Eh, it's not over yet.

00:41.341 --> 00:42.569
There's still game six.

00:42.642 --> 00:45.008
We're not the only ones
making history today.

00:45.111 --> 00:46.976
Bokai just broke
DiMaggio's record.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.207
l don't believe it.

00:48.281 --> 00:49.441
lf you ask me,

00:49.516 --> 00:51.211
Houston's been manipulating
the stats.

00:51.284 --> 00:54.253
They do have a few too many
Kings fans at Mission Control.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.685
Well, how else do you explain

00:55.755 --> 00:57.689
Bokai beating out
the Yankee Clipper?

01:00.026 --> 01:02.324
Commander, we lost you
for a second there.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.158
The ride got a little bumpy.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.424
Stand by.

01:05.498 --> 01:08.126
l'm picking up some turbulence.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.462
At your altitude?

01:09.569 --> 01:11.366
Checking LlDAR.

01:11.471 --> 01:13.166
What the hell...?

01:13.273 --> 01:14.797
John, what's going on?

01:14.908 --> 01:17.274
There's an object
closing on my position- -

01:17.343 --> 01:20.335
azimuth 121.6.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.142
Whatever it is, it's huge.

01:22.215 --> 01:23.580
lt's over 1,000 meters across.

01:23.650 --> 01:26.585
How could something that big
appear out of nowhere?

01:26.653 --> 01:29.451
l don't know,
but l'm getting out of its way.

01:29.522 --> 01:30.819
Firing thrusters.

01:32.325 --> 01:34.384
lt's probably
just a solar flare.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.759
Let's hope so.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.572 --> 01:47.563
lt's no solar flare.

03:44.123 --> 03:45.556
Come in.

03:47.293 --> 03:49.261
Come in.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.479
Chakotay to the Bridge.

04:07.547 --> 04:09.742
This is Transporter Room 2.

04:09.816 --> 04:11.613
l'm trying to reach the Bridge.

04:11.684 --> 04:14.312
Your com signal
was routed here, sir.

04:14.387 --> 04:16.411
Can you patch me through?

04:16.488 --> 04:18.684
Uh, pardon me? Who is this?

04:18.757 --> 04:19.690
Patch you through where?

04:19.759 --> 04:21.055
Patch you through
where... where?

04:21.127 --> 04:22.492
Neelix?

04:22.562 --> 04:23.494
Commander?

04:23.563 --> 04:25.463
Double check
on the fuel generators.

04:25.531 --> 04:27.465
Control seven, return to base...

04:27.533 --> 04:28.864
Maintenance Team 49...

04:28.968 --> 04:30.128
Culhane to Nozawa,
what's keeping you?

04:30.236 --> 04:31.362
Computer, locate Naomi...

04:31.471 --> 04:32.938
We're meeting
in the Briefing Room.

04:33.039 --> 04:34.529
l can't get through
to Engineering.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.040
l'm scheduled for Holodeck 2.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.339
Culhane to Nozawa...

05:01.501 --> 05:04.197
l see you're making some changes
to the computer core.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.465
l have enhanced
the command sequencers

05:06.572 --> 05:07.869
with Borg algorithms.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.033
Well, your enhancements
are wreaking havoc

05:10.143 --> 05:11.542
with our secondary systems.

05:11.611 --> 05:12.873
lnsignificant malfunctions.

05:13.012 --> 05:14.274
l will correct them.

05:14.347 --> 05:16.338
l don't recall authorizing
any modifications.

05:16.416 --> 05:17.883
The computer core
is inefficient.

05:17.950 --> 05:19.349
lt needed to be improved.

05:19.419 --> 05:22.616
l appreciate your initiative,
but that's not up to you.

05:22.689 --> 05:24.816
l've explained the value
of these enhancements

05:24.891 --> 05:25.983
on several occasions,

05:26.059 --> 05:28.254
but Lieutenant Torres
chose to ignore me.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.888
l thought a demonstration
would be more persuasive.

05:31.030 --> 05:33.794
Well, l doubt this one's
going to change her mind.

05:33.866 --> 05:36.027
Clearly Voyager
is not yet ready

05:36.135 --> 05:37.329
for assimilation.

05:39.572 --> 05:41.039
A joke.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.402
The Doctor suggested

05:42.475 --> 05:44.739
that l diffuse tense
situations with humor.

05:44.811 --> 05:45.937
Good idea.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.139
Now, how about getting
these systems back up again

05:48.214 --> 05:49.442
so l can get back
to my book?

05:53.186 --> 05:56.917
We're experiencing a
shipwide power drain.

05:56.989 --> 05:59.981
This is unrelated
to my modifications.

06:02.061 --> 06:04.791
Senior officers to the Bridge.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.064
lt's 2:00 in the morning,
Ensign.

06:12.171 --> 06:14.799
This better be more
than a little turbulence.

06:14.907 --> 06:16.306
You won't be disappointed.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.037
We've got level- 9
gravimetric distortions

06:18.111 --> 06:19.203
closing on our position.

06:19.278 --> 06:20.870
They are emanating
from subspace.

06:20.947 --> 06:22.881
On screen.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.284
Shields.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.585
lt's heading right toward us.

06:33.659 --> 06:35.490
Evasive maneuvers.

06:44.103 --> 06:45.127
Captain?

06:45.238 --> 06:47.331
Say good morning
to 30 million terajoules

06:47.440 --> 06:48.407
of subspace energy.

06:48.508 --> 06:49.998
This thing is following us.

06:50.109 --> 06:51.940
l can't outrun it at impulse.

06:52.011 --> 06:52.978
Go to warp.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.880
lt's disrupting our warp field.

06:56.949 --> 06:58.746
lf it any gets closer,
the gravimetric stresses

06:58.818 --> 07:00.342
are going to rip the plating
off our hull.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.320
Captain, l recognize
this phenomenon.

07:02.388 --> 07:04.652
lts Borg designation
is Spatial Anomaly 521.

07:04.724 --> 07:08.251
lt's attracted to objects that
emit electromagnetic energy.

07:08.327 --> 07:11.819
We have to cut power
and reverse our shield polarity.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.558
Do it.

07:21.073 --> 07:22.734
That was close.

07:24.076 --> 07:26.340
l recognize this anomaly, too.

07:26.412 --> 07:29.279
lt's called a graviton ellipse.

07:29.348 --> 07:31.441
According to
the Federation database,

07:31.517 --> 07:33.041
it travels through subspace,

07:33.119 --> 07:37.146
emerging occasionally
without warning.

07:37.223 --> 07:41.887
Ellipses have only been
observed a handful of times.

07:41.994 --> 07:43.154
Ares lV.

07:43.229 --> 07:44.696
Commander?

07:44.764 --> 07:47.699
One of the early Mars missions.

07:47.767 --> 07:50.463
The command module and
its pilot were engulfed

07:50.570 --> 07:53.630
by a similar phenomenon
back in 2032.

07:53.739 --> 07:55.229
l remember reading about that.

07:55.341 --> 07:58.071
Two astronauts were stranded
on the surface for weeks

07:58.144 --> 07:59.634
before a rescue ship arrived.

07:59.712 --> 08:02.044
No one's gotten this close
to a graviton ellipse

08:02.148 --> 08:03.479
and lived to tell about it.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.450
This could be a
remarkable opportunity.

08:05.518 --> 08:06.780
Go to Yellow Alert.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.821
Keep our power output
at minimum levels.

08:08.955 --> 08:11.651
Match its course and speed,
but maintain a safe distance.

08:11.724 --> 08:13.487
Aye, Captain.

08:13.559 --> 08:14.821
l suggest we launch a probe.

08:14.927 --> 08:17.452
See if we can find out
what makes this thing tick.

08:17.530 --> 08:18.554
Well, make it fast.

08:18.631 --> 08:20.394
There's no telling
when our visitor

08:20.466 --> 08:22.457
is going to burrow back
into subspace.

08:31.711 --> 08:34.544
l'm receiving telemetry
from the probe.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.812
lt appears to have
entered a stable core

08:40.886 --> 08:42.115
within the anomaly,

08:42.188 --> 08:44.418
where gravimetric forces
are negligible.

08:44.490 --> 08:45.718
The eye of the storm.

08:45.791 --> 08:47.452
An apt metaphor.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.121
Computer, run a
multispectral analysis

08:50.196 --> 08:51.720
of the anomaly's core.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.890
Analysis in progress.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.627
The Borg developed shields

08:55.735 --> 08:57.896
to get through
the gravimetric currents.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.665
They intended to dissipate
the anomaly from within.

09:00.773 --> 09:03.071
Perhaps we should
continue their efforts.

09:03.142 --> 09:05.201
lt would be shortsighted
to destroy it.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.246
We should study the phenomenon.

09:10.116 --> 09:11.413
l didn't realize

09:11.484 --> 09:14.248
you shared this crew's
penchant for exploration.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.288
l am a Starfleet officer.

09:16.355 --> 09:18.789
When the risks outweigh
the potential gain,

09:18.858 --> 09:20.587
exploration is illogical.

09:20.660 --> 09:24.494
We can't predict
what we might find here, Seven.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.965
One must allow
for the unexpected discovery.

09:28.034 --> 09:30.434
Core analysis complete.

09:32.872 --> 09:36.774
There are more than 2.8 billion
compounds in the core.

09:36.842 --> 09:39.003
Fascinating.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.443
The computer has isolated

09:40.513 --> 09:45.075
several synthetic alloys native
to Sector 001.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.982
Titanium
and polymer composites.

09:47.053 --> 09:49.715
These materials date back
to the 21st century.

09:49.789 --> 09:51.780
They were used
in the construction

09:51.857 --> 09:53.415
of Earth's early spacecraft.

09:53.492 --> 09:55.892
Commander Chakotay
mentioned a space capsule

09:55.995 --> 09:58.259
that was consumed
by a graviton ellipse.

09:58.331 --> 10:02.062
These alloys are consistent
with the hull of that capsule.

10:05.638 --> 10:08.869
An unexpected discovery, indeed.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.846
She was 46 meters,
92 metric tons,

10:22.922 --> 10:25.413
powered by a third- generation
ion drive,

10:25.491 --> 10:27.959
and equipped
with a transpectral imager.

10:28.094 --> 10:31.222
Ares lVwas piloted
by Lieutenant John Kelly.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.857
His ground team,
astronauts Rose Kumagawa

10:33.933 --> 10:35.332
and Andrei Novakovich,

10:35.434 --> 10:38.267
were close to completing
their survey mission

10:38.337 --> 10:41.773
when Kelly reported an object
closing on his position.

10:41.874 --> 10:43.341
Then he and the command module

10:43.409 --> 10:45.377
disappeared
off NASA's LlDAR scopes.

10:45.444 --> 10:46.706
And into the history books.

10:46.779 --> 10:49.179
That incident almost derailed
the Mars program.

10:49.248 --> 10:53.014
Mankind's first encounter
with a spatial anomaly.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.847
Seven, you said
the Borg were working

10:54.920 --> 10:56.888
on a way to get inside
a graviton ellipse.

10:56.956 --> 10:59.618
Shield enhancements.

10:59.692 --> 11:00.920
Well, maybe we could apply

11:01.027 --> 11:02.688
the same enhancements
to the Flyer.

11:02.728 --> 11:05.026
Captain, do you intend to try
to find the command module?

11:05.097 --> 11:06.997
Or what's left of it.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.728
By my calculations,
we have less than 16 hours

11:09.835 --> 11:12.326
before the anomaly
goes back into subspace.

11:12.438 --> 11:13.905
Then we have to work quickly.

11:14.073 --> 11:16.735
Harry, B'Elanna, help Seven
modify the Flyer's shields.

11:16.809 --> 11:19.937
Tom, review the database
from the Ares lVmission.

11:20.079 --> 11:22.206
lt might tell us something
about this anomaly

11:22.281 --> 11:23.339
we've missed.

11:23.416 --> 11:26.544
We're going to need
a mission leader.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.211
l volunteer.

11:28.287 --> 11:29.345
l thought you might.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.549
Let's do it.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.555
Something on your mind,
Seven?

11:37.630 --> 11:40.064
The anomaly is as dangerous
and unpredictable now

11:40.132 --> 11:42.623
as it was 300 years ago.

11:42.735 --> 11:44.635
Well, the Delta Flyer is
a little more advanced

11:44.704 --> 11:45.636
than the Ares lVwas.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.002
We'll be taking
every precaution.

11:47.139 --> 11:49.471
That may not be enough.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.978
l appreciate your concern,
but this is my call.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.912
Searching
for the command module seems

11:55.981 --> 11:57.778
more sentimental
than scientific.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.648
Well, l can't argue with that.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.154
lf scientific knowledge
was all we were after,

12:03.222 --> 12:05.156
then the Federation
would have built

12:05.224 --> 12:06.987
a fleet of probes,
not starships.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.892
Exploration is about seeing
things with your own eyes.

12:10.029 --> 12:12.122
ln this case,
we're exploring the past.

12:12.198 --> 12:14.666
How will retrieving
this artifact

12:14.734 --> 12:16.531
enhance your appreciation
of history?

12:16.635 --> 12:19.297
By making us part of it,
in the same way

12:19.405 --> 12:22.568
that excavating the obelisks
of ancient Vulcan,

12:22.641 --> 12:24.666
or finding
the Shroud of Kahless

12:24.777 --> 12:28.235
made those explorers
part of their history.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.447
Here's the crux of it.

12:33.419 --> 12:37.515
As a Borg, you didn't study
the past; you ingested it.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.319
You never really developed

12:39.391 --> 12:41.689
an appreciation for
humanity's history.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.228
Maybe this is an opportunity

12:43.295 --> 12:45.695
for you to do some
exploring of your own.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.427
Are you ordering me
to join this mission?

12:48.534 --> 12:51.765
Let's just say l'm encouraging
you to volunteer.

12:56.575 --> 12:58.543
lt's no solar flare.

13:00.312 --> 13:02.007
Wow.

13:02.081 --> 13:04.311
John, can you describe it?

13:04.383 --> 13:07.682
lt... it's at least
1,000 meters wide.

13:07.753 --> 13:08.879
Bright.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.683
Your transmission's breaking up.

13:10.756 --> 13:13.224
lt's generating
an electromagnetic radiation

13:13.292 --> 13:15.123
interfering
with primary systems.

13:15.194 --> 13:17.492
l can't get away from it.

13:17.563 --> 13:20.259
Activating
the transpectral imager.

13:20.332 --> 13:23.028
l'll record
as much data as l can.

13:24.770 --> 13:26.169
lt's right on top of me!

13:26.238 --> 13:28.001
l'll transmit as much as l ca...

13:29.341 --> 13:31.241
That's all she wrote.

13:33.012 --> 13:37.108
NASA received Kelly's
last telemetry

13:37.183 --> 13:40.812
at 0922 hours, October 19, 2032.

13:40.886 --> 13:43.184
l thought l was the Mars buff.

13:43.255 --> 13:44.950
You seem to know more
about the Ares lV

13:45.024 --> 13:46.286
than l do.

13:46.358 --> 13:49.623
The Mars missions paved the way
for the exploration of space.

13:49.695 --> 13:51.663
Kelly was one
of my childhood heroes.

13:51.730 --> 13:54.563
Yeah, mine, too.

13:54.633 --> 13:55.565
That's dedication.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.135
The man's life's about to end,

13:57.203 --> 13:58.966
but he won't stop
taking readings.

13:59.071 --> 14:00.766
Makes you wonder
if those old- timers

14:00.840 --> 14:03.104
were made of sterner
stuff than we are.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.665
You think we have it easy?

14:04.777 --> 14:05.709
Are you kidding?

14:05.778 --> 14:08.008
Warp drive, shields,
transporters- -

14:08.080 --> 14:10.514
we're traveling
in the lap of luxury.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.313
Kelly and Kumagawa,
Armstrong and Glenn- -

14:13.385 --> 14:15.319
they were the real pioneers.

14:15.387 --> 14:16.979
Am l interrupting?

14:17.056 --> 14:21.254
We're just admiring someone,
a fellow explorer.

14:21.327 --> 14:23.124
Hero worship- - 
the glorification

14:23.195 --> 14:25.186
of an individual's
accomplishments.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.732
l guess you didn't have
many role models growing up.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.892
ln the collective,

14:29.001 --> 14:30.559
personal accomplishments
are irrelevant.

14:30.669 --> 14:33.331
The shield modifications
to the Delta Flyer are complete.

14:33.439 --> 14:34.497
We're ready for launch.

14:34.607 --> 14:35.539
We?

14:35.608 --> 14:37.542
You'll need someone familiar

14:37.610 --> 14:40.738
with Borg technology
to monitor the shields.

14:40.813 --> 14:41.939
l'm volunteering.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.447
Well, you don't sound
too happy about it.

14:44.516 --> 14:47.917
l'm not, but this mission
can benefit from my expertise.

14:47.987 --> 14:49.955
ln that case...

14:50.022 --> 14:52.354
welcome aboard.

14:52.424 --> 14:53.948
l'm preparing an inoculant

14:54.093 --> 14:56.857
to counter the effects
of gravimetric radiation.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.521
Of course,
if you were a hologram,

14:58.597 --> 15:00.565
you'd simply adjust
your mobile emitter.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.123
That's what l did
on Arakis Prime,

15:02.234 --> 15:03.724
one of my first away missions.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.133
l don't recall that.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.761
This was before you came aboard.

15:06.872 --> 15:09.136
Such an enchanting planet- -

15:09.208 --> 15:10.869
crystalline glaciers...

15:10.943 --> 15:12.843
magnesium vapor atmosphere.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.880
l had to stop my
metallurgical scans

15:14.947 --> 15:17.177
just to admire
the sheer beauty of it- -

15:17.249 --> 15:20.878
to... ''smell the roses,''
to coin a phrase.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.715
An inefficient use of your time.

15:22.788 --> 15:24.779
Hmm. Perhaps.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.620
We're all finished here,

15:26.692 --> 15:28.250
except for one thing.

15:29.895 --> 15:32.090
Would you mind
recording some images

15:32.164 --> 15:34.325
when you're inside the ellipse,

15:34.400 --> 15:36.891
for those of us not lucky
enough to make the trip?

15:37.002 --> 15:40.267
You envy my participation
on this mission.

15:40.339 --> 15:42.432
There isn't a crewman
aboard who doesn't.

15:42.541 --> 15:43.803
Why?

15:43.876 --> 15:46.572
l can only tell you
how l felt that morning

15:46.645 --> 15:48.909
when l materialized
on Arakis Prime.

15:48.981 --> 15:52.314
l left my footprints
in the magnesite dust,

15:52.384 --> 15:55.945
and thought, ''One small
step for a hologram,

15:56.021 --> 15:58.353
one giant leap for mankind.''

15:58.424 --> 16:00.392
To coin a phrase.

16:01.894 --> 16:05.125
Well, l know the sentiment
isn't exactly original,

16:05.197 --> 16:07.131
but the fact is
l was exhilarated.

16:07.199 --> 16:08.928
Chakotay to Seven of Nine.

16:09.034 --> 16:11.002
Report to Shuttle Bay 2.

16:11.070 --> 16:12.230
Good luck.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.978
We're approaching the perimeter

16:27.052 --> 16:30.385
in five, four...

16:30.456 --> 16:32.083
three, two,

16:32.157 --> 16:34.250
one.

16:36.562 --> 16:37.893
We're within 2,000 kilometers.

16:37.963 --> 16:39.726
Gravimetric interference
is increasing.

16:39.798 --> 16:42.198
lt's nothing compared
to what they're going through.

16:42.301 --> 16:44.269
They're really getting
knocked around in there.

16:44.370 --> 16:46.998
The shields have weakened,
but they're still holding.

16:47.106 --> 16:48.573
Harry, keep your finger
on that tractor beam

16:48.674 --> 16:49.936
in case we have
to pull them out.

16:50.075 --> 16:52.737
They're approaching
the anomaly's core.

16:52.811 --> 16:54.335
We've lost sensor contact.

16:54.413 --> 16:55.505
Harry.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.310
The com link is still active.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.083
The gravimetric shear
is increasing.

17:03.155 --> 17:05.453
l'm reading diminished
turbulence directly ahead.

17:05.523 --> 17:06.991
Full thrusters, Tom.

17:07.059 --> 17:08.356
Punch us through.

17:15.401 --> 17:17.300
Chakotay to Voyager.

17:19.171 --> 17:21.195
We're in.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.576
l wish you could see this,
Captain.

17:28.647 --> 17:29.579
lt's incredible.

17:29.648 --> 17:30.740
We're all ears.

17:30.816 --> 17:33.182
lt's very calm,
no gravimetric distortions.

17:33.252 --> 17:36.881
The EM activity is creating
a natural luminescence.

17:36.955 --> 17:38.820
Tom called it ''mood lighting.''

17:38.891 --> 17:41.382
Hey, B'Elanna, it's
the perfect romantic getaway.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.052
l'll take your word for it.

17:43.128 --> 17:46.461
We've detected asteroid
fragments, pieces of vessels,

17:46.532 --> 17:48.432
matter from every Quadrant
of the galaxy.

17:48.534 --> 17:50.729
Next time l lose something,
l'll know where to look.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.098
lnstead of a graviton ellipse,

17:52.204 --> 17:54.695
we should call it
the ''Kitchen Sink Anomaly.''

17:54.807 --> 17:56.468
The chemical interactions
have even created

17:56.542 --> 17:58.134
a primitive atmosphere.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.337
Nothing you'd want
to breathe, of course.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.744
What do you make of it, Seven?

18:02.815 --> 18:06.307
Well, l suppose it's intriguing.

18:06.385 --> 18:09.821
Some of the matter appears to be
extra- dimensional in origin.

18:09.922 --> 18:13.221
Sounds like this anomaly's
gotten around.

18:13.292 --> 18:15.522
Any sign
of the Ares command module?

18:15.594 --> 18:17.528
We're picking up traces
of the hull,

18:17.596 --> 18:19.826
but our sensor readings
are being refracted

18:19.898 --> 18:21.263
by all the debris in here.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.003
That was a gravimetric surge,

18:25.104 --> 18:28.005
caused by the anomaly
altering its course

18:28.073 --> 18:29.335
by .006 degrees.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.376
We just had a big jolt
out here.

18:31.477 --> 18:33.104
We didn't feel a thing.

18:33.178 --> 18:35.112
By our estimate, you have
five hours, 36 minutes

18:35.180 --> 18:36.841
before the anomaly
returns to subspace.

18:36.915 --> 18:38.212
You better get a move on.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.080
Understood.

18:40.152 --> 18:41.881
l'm having difficulty

18:41.954 --> 18:44.149
isolating the debris
from the command module.

18:44.223 --> 18:46.555
l'll lay in a search pattern.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.526
lt may take a couple of hours
to cover an area this large.

18:49.595 --> 18:52.063
Seven and l can use the time
to take some samples.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.066
Get a better idea
of where this anomaly's been.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.328
We should focus on
achieving our objective

18:57.436 --> 18:58.698
and returning to Voyager.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.431
We're not here
just to find the module.

19:00.539 --> 19:01.870
We've got an opportunity to...

19:01.940 --> 19:02.804
To explore.

19:02.941 --> 19:05.171
l am familiar with our mission.

19:05.244 --> 19:08.372
ln that case, let's get started.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.824
The fossilized
microbes in this ore

19:19.958 --> 19:22.085
appear to have had
metallic membranes.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.358
We've speculated
about the possibility

19:25.430 --> 19:30.129
of metallic life- forms,
but we've never discovered one.

19:31.236 --> 19:33.067
You're excited
by this discovery.

19:34.773 --> 19:35.967
This piece of rock

19:36.041 --> 19:38.168
is billions of years
older than Earth...

19:38.243 --> 19:41.110
from a time when the
galaxy was still forming.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.169
Here.

19:42.247 --> 19:43.714
Commander.

19:43.782 --> 19:44.976
Take it.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.652
You're holding
a piece of history...

19:50.722 --> 19:52.849
maybe even the beginnings
of life itself.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.449
Unlikely.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.494
lt's more likely than you think.

19:56.562 --> 19:57.859
This anomaly is as old

19:57.930 --> 19:59.898
as anything
we've ever encountered.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.465
l could spend a lifetime

20:01.533 --> 20:03.592
studying the things
it's collected.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.330
And leave Voyager
without a First Officer?

20:06.438 --> 20:08.702
They'd manage.

20:08.774 --> 20:11.436
Paleontology was
always my first love.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.944
lt's the reason
l joined Starfleet.

20:14.079 --> 20:15.478
Why didn't you pursue it?

20:15.547 --> 20:18.448
My sense of responsibility
got in the way- -

20:18.517 --> 20:21.543
first the Maquis, then Voyager.

20:21.620 --> 20:24.783
What l wanted always seemed
to take a backseat.

20:24.856 --> 20:27.552
Do you remember
what you wanted to be

20:27.626 --> 20:29.753
before you were assimilated?

20:29.828 --> 20:33.389
l was assimilated
when l was a child.

20:33.465 --> 20:37.765
l knew l wanted to be a
paleontologist when l was six.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.232
A ballerina.

20:45.611 --> 20:47.203
Maybe it's not too late.

20:47.279 --> 20:49.770
lt was a juvenile fantasy.

20:49.848 --> 20:51.839
Those are the ones
that stick with you.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.316
Heads up, folks.

20:53.385 --> 20:55.285
l think we're getting close.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.685
l've isolated the module.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.590
Bearing 39 mark 15.

21:02.661 --> 21:04.652
There.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.099
lt appears to be intact.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.433
l'm reading hull
breaches and corrosion,

21:13.538 --> 21:16.063
but all things considered,
it's pretty well preserved.

21:16.174 --> 21:18.404
We weren't expecting
to find a fragment this big.

21:18.477 --> 21:20.945
We can't just stow it
in the aft section.

21:22.180 --> 21:25.445
We'll use a tractor beam
to tow it back to Voyager.

21:26.518 --> 21:27.610
Captain, the anomaly just made

21:27.686 --> 21:30.280
another course change- - 
.003 degrees.

21:30.355 --> 21:31.947
That's the third one in an hour.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.719
Something has to be
attracting it.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.555
There's nothing on the sensors.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.652
l think it enjoys
being unpredictable.

21:37.729 --> 21:40.493
We know it has a taste
for electromagnetic energy.

21:40.565 --> 21:43.056
So what could generate
an EM field large enough

21:43.168 --> 21:46.001
to get its attention but
still not show up on sensors?

21:46.071 --> 21:49.734
An energy burst from a pulsar,
a neutrino cloud.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.002
Dark matter.

21:51.076 --> 21:54.671
Realign the sensor array
to scan for EM fluctuations.

21:55.881 --> 21:58.213
l've got
a spatial disturbance...

21:58.283 --> 22:00.080
three million kilometers away.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.813
lt's a dark- matter asteroid.

22:01.887 --> 22:02.876
Bingo.

22:02.954 --> 22:04.649
The anomaly's heading
right for it.

22:04.723 --> 22:05.815
Time to impact?

22:05.891 --> 22:07.791
Four minutes.
Captain,

22:07.859 --> 22:10.293
we can't predict how the impact
will affect the anomaly.

22:10.362 --> 22:13.229
But it's a safe bet
it won't be a gentle nudge.

22:13.298 --> 22:14.890
Janeway to Delta Flyer.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.092
We've got a problem.

22:16.201 --> 22:17.634
The anomaly's
on a collision course

22:17.703 --> 22:18.829
with a dark- matter asteroid.

22:18.937 --> 22:20.131
We've located the Mars orbiter.

22:20.238 --> 22:22.172
We're adapting a tractor beam.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.172
Give us a minute.

22:23.241 --> 22:24.299
You don't have it;
get out of there.

22:24.409 --> 22:25.137
Captain...

22:25.210 --> 22:25.938
Now.

22:26.044 --> 22:29.172
ls the tractor beam ready?

22:29.247 --> 22:30.373
Just about, sir.

22:30.449 --> 22:33.179
Lock onto the module
and take us out.

22:33.251 --> 22:34.616
We don't have time.

22:34.686 --> 22:36.119
l gave you an order.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.450
Commander.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.922
We're not leaving
without that module.

22:41.793 --> 22:42.953
Tom!

22:50.435 --> 22:51.697
Captain, both the anomaly

22:51.803 --> 22:53.270
and the asteroid
are accelerating.

22:53.338 --> 22:55.704
They're attracting each other
like a pair of magnets.

22:55.774 --> 22:57.742
At this rate, it'll impact in...

22:57.843 --> 22:58.810
56 seconds.

22:58.910 --> 23:00.639
Chakotay, you've got
less than a minute.

23:00.746 --> 23:01.735
Acknowledged.

23:01.780 --> 23:04.214
The module is slowing us down.

23:04.282 --> 23:05.510
Maintain tractor lock.

23:05.584 --> 23:07.643
How long until we clear
the anomaly?

23:07.719 --> 23:09.880
At our current speed,
40 seconds.

23:09.955 --> 23:10.944
We can do it.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.385
30 seconds to impact.
They're still not clear.

23:17.462 --> 23:18.861
Chakotay, status.

23:18.930 --> 23:21.160
We're on our way.

23:23.135 --> 23:24.466
20 seconds.

23:42.954 --> 23:45.252
Gravimetric distortions
are increasing.

23:45.323 --> 23:46.255
The Flyer.

23:46.324 --> 23:47.723
l've lost the signal.

24:01.706 --> 24:03.435
How badly is he damaged?

24:03.508 --> 24:05.976
He's got a severe concussion
and internal injuries.

24:06.077 --> 24:07.567
We need to get him
back to Voyager.

24:07.646 --> 24:08.977
That may not be possible.

24:09.047 --> 24:10.708
Communications,
shields and propulsion

24:10.782 --> 24:12.010
are still off- line.

24:12.083 --> 24:13.380
Well, he's stable for now.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.749
l'll give you a hand.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.082
We can repair the shields,

24:16.154 --> 24:18.179
but the engines
are unsalvageable.

24:18.256 --> 24:19.553
lt can't be that bad.

24:19.624 --> 24:20.784
lt's worse.

24:20.859 --> 24:23.885
The anomaly is showing signs
of returning to subspace.

24:24.029 --> 24:25.690
We have less than two hours.

24:43.815 --> 24:46.249
He's regaining consciousness.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.512
Easy.

24:47.586 --> 24:49.349
Easy. Lie still.

24:49.421 --> 24:52.117
lt feels like l went ten rounds
with an Andorian.

24:52.190 --> 24:53.384
More like 20.

24:53.458 --> 24:55.926
You were hit
with a plasma discharge.

24:55.994 --> 24:58.622
The gravimetric surge
from the asteroid

24:58.697 --> 25:02.463
caught us at the edge of the
anomaly, tossed us back inside.

25:02.567 --> 25:04.296
The command module?

25:04.402 --> 25:06.563
lt's adrift, 300 meters
off our port bow.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.161
Then we can still salvage it.

25:08.273 --> 25:10.070
Not so fast.

25:10.141 --> 25:12.234
We can't get engines
or shields back on line,

25:12.310 --> 25:13.777
not to mention a tractor beam.

25:13.879 --> 25:15.244
We'll be lucky
to get out of this

25:15.313 --> 25:16.371
in one piece.

25:16.448 --> 25:17.380
l can help.

25:17.449 --> 25:19.417
You're in worse shape
than this ship.

25:19.484 --> 25:20.416
You want to help?

25:20.485 --> 25:21.543
Lie in the bed- - 
doctor's orders.

25:23.788 --> 25:25.551
Another gravimetric surge.

25:25.624 --> 25:29.754
l'll see if l can reinforce
the structural integrity field.

25:33.865 --> 25:36.857
You might try drawing power
from auxiliary life support.

25:36.968 --> 25:38.560
The system was
damaged as well.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.729
What about
the secondary relays?

25:40.839 --> 25:42.067
They're off- line.

25:42.140 --> 25:43.937
That doesn't leave us
many choices.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.067
Try rerouting
the phaser couplings.

25:46.144 --> 25:49.272
We explored that option
while you were unconscious.

25:49.347 --> 25:50.871
Then maybe you can
bring me up- to- date.

25:50.949 --> 25:51.881
There's no time.

25:51.950 --> 25:53.281
l suggest you recuperate.

25:53.351 --> 25:55.285
We have the situation
under control.

25:55.353 --> 25:57.150
lt doesn't look that way
from here.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.190
l'm still in command
of this mission.

25:59.257 --> 26:00.849
l want to know what's going on.

26:00.959 --> 26:03.120
Very well.

26:03.161 --> 26:05.823
We were ordered by the Captain
to leave this anomaly,

26:05.964 --> 26:07.955
but you chose
to disobey that command.

26:08.033 --> 26:11.298
As a result of your obsession
with the module,

26:11.403 --> 26:13.030
we are now trapped
along with it.

26:13.138 --> 26:15.572
ln all probability,
we won't survive without...

26:15.640 --> 26:16.732
Point taken.

26:16.841 --> 26:20.538
Now, why don't you continue
without the attitude?

26:23.081 --> 26:25.879
An inventory
of the damaged systems.

26:26.017 --> 26:27.780
Read it for yourself.

26:34.292 --> 26:35.589
l made a mistake.

26:35.660 --> 26:37.651
l put the mission at risk.

26:37.729 --> 26:39.822
You put our lives at risk.

26:43.735 --> 26:46.670
Well, if we don't make it out...

26:48.073 --> 26:50.337
someone's bound
to come looking for us

26:50.408 --> 26:51.841
in a few hundred years.

26:54.145 --> 26:58.582
Diffusing a tense situation
with humor... remember?

26:58.650 --> 27:01.118
Voyager to Delta Flyer.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.015
They're using a probe
as a transmission relay.

27:06.091 --> 27:08.082
Voyager to Chakotay,
please respond.

27:08.159 --> 27:09.592
We can't detect you.

27:09.661 --> 27:10.992
Captain, we can hear you.

27:11.062 --> 27:12.927
l'm matching their frequency.

27:12.998 --> 27:15.762
Voyager, this is
the Delta Flyer. Respond.

27:15.834 --> 27:17.495
Are you all right?

27:17.602 --> 27:18.796
What's your status?

27:18.903 --> 27:22.669
We've sustained heavy damage,
Captain, but we're alive.

27:22.741 --> 27:24.709
lt's good to hear your voice.

27:27.212 --> 27:28.975
We could install
the same shielding

27:29.047 --> 27:31.038
on a class- 2 shuttle,
and take it in.

27:31.116 --> 27:33.311
lt took us hours
to make the modifications

27:33.385 --> 27:34.409
to the Flyer.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.748
We've only got 82 minutes

27:35.820 --> 27:38.050
before this thing disappears
into subspace.

27:38.123 --> 27:40.353
lt may be possible
to modify a tractor beam

27:40.425 --> 27:42.757
to cut through the
gravimetric interference.

27:42.827 --> 27:45.762
You'll never be able to get
it all the way to the core.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.263
Start working on it anyway.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.596
You said all the energy conduits
are fused?

27:49.701 --> 27:50.725
Correct.

27:50.835 --> 27:52.894
We can't get power
to any of the primary systems.

27:53.038 --> 27:54.369
lf the replicators were working,

27:54.439 --> 27:56.066
we could whip up
a new plasma manifold

27:56.174 --> 27:57.505
and be on our way.

27:57.575 --> 28:00.203
What if l could get you
an old manifold?

28:00.278 --> 28:01.540
Excuse me?

28:01.613 --> 28:04.446
The command module
may be three centuries old,

28:04.516 --> 28:06.575
but the power
distribution system

28:06.651 --> 28:09.051
isn't that different
from the Flyer's.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.587
Right here.

28:10.655 --> 28:13.249
This control panel
in the main cockpit- -

28:13.324 --> 28:15.519
it was called
an ion distributor.

28:15.593 --> 28:19.085
With a few tweaks, it could be
modified to channel warp plasma.

28:19.164 --> 28:22.361
Even if it were possible,
we'd have to obtain the object

28:22.434 --> 28:23.401
before we can adapt it.

28:23.501 --> 28:24.399
Do you have

28:24.502 --> 28:26.402
enough power to beam one of you
to the module?

28:26.471 --> 28:27.995
Yes, ma'am. l'll go.

28:28.106 --> 28:30.074
Not so fast, Tom.

28:30.175 --> 28:32.006
lf another
gravimetric surge hits,

28:32.077 --> 28:33.601
we'll need you at the helm.

28:33.678 --> 28:34.872
Seven?

28:35.013 --> 28:38.972
Are you encouraging me
to volunteer again, Captain?

28:39.050 --> 28:41.484
You read my mind.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.487
Come on.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.422
Just a little closer.

28:54.232 --> 28:55.631
That's it for thrusters,

28:55.700 --> 28:58.066
but l got us
within transporter range. Ready?

28:58.169 --> 28:59.830
Stand by.

29:11.750 --> 29:15.550
lronic. You're doing
what l've always dreamt of.

29:15.620 --> 29:20.250
Remember, when you
set foot in that module,

29:20.325 --> 29:22.418
you'll be stepping into history.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.428
History is irrelevant.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.464
lrrelevant?

29:28.767 --> 29:30.530
Do me a favor.

29:30.635 --> 29:32.398
When you're over there,

29:32.504 --> 29:36.235
download whatever you can
from their database

29:36.307 --> 29:39.367
and also, take a minute
to look around...

29:39.444 --> 29:42.379
so you can tell us
what it was like.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.005
There may not be time...

29:47.986 --> 29:49.851
but l'll try.

29:49.921 --> 29:52.890
Good luck.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.404
What's it like in there?

30:07.472 --> 30:08.803
Dark.

30:13.845 --> 30:17.440
The ambient temperature
is minus 260 degrees.

30:19.818 --> 30:23.151
There appear to be fractures
in the aft bulkheads.

30:23.221 --> 30:24.745
ls the cockpit intact?

30:24.823 --> 30:26.518
Yes.

30:47.245 --> 30:50.339
l've brought the main computer
on line.

30:50.415 --> 30:54.476
l've lost contact
with the team on the surface,

30:54.552 --> 30:57.453
and l can't get a fix
on my position.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.012
What was that?

30:59.157 --> 31:00.624
There's an active data file.

31:00.725 --> 31:02.590
lt appears
to contain log entries.

31:02.627 --> 31:04.527
Can you play them for us?

31:05.964 --> 31:07.795
l believe so.

31:10.501 --> 31:13.061
Consider it my last request.

31:19.444 --> 31:22.607
...and l can't get
a fix on my position,

31:22.680 --> 31:27.379
but l'm alive, and the CM seems
to be intact.

31:29.087 --> 31:31.715
l'm inside this whatever it is.

31:31.789 --> 31:33.381
Could you hear that, Chakotay?

31:33.458 --> 31:35.688
lt's amazing.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.820
Everyone assumed
he was killed instantly.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.592
...what l've gotten myself into.

31:40.665 --> 31:42.963
lt's very calm, like l'm
in the eye of a hurricane.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.625
lt's a little spooky.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.260
The way l figure it,

31:46.371 --> 31:48.464
if there's a way in,
there's got to be a way out.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.541
l'm going to fire up
the transpectral imager

31:50.608 --> 31:52.701
before l initiate
another engine burn...

31:54.012 --> 31:56.776
...collect as much data
as l can.

31:56.848 --> 31:59.840
Jeannie, l may not be bringing
you back a Mars rock,

31:59.918 --> 32:01.749
but l promise you,

32:01.853 --> 32:03.753
l'm going to do everything
l can to get home.

32:08.793 --> 32:11.990
Ares lV Mission Record,
October 23.

32:12.063 --> 32:14.327
l'm starting to feel like Jonah.

32:14.399 --> 32:17.334
How long was he in the belly
of that whale? Three days?

32:17.435 --> 32:21.303
l got him beat
by a day or two already.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.501
The EM interference

32:26.577 --> 32:28.875
is disrupting communications
and LlDAR,

32:28.947 --> 32:30.710
and l can't see the stars,

32:30.782 --> 32:33.751
so there's no way
l can get a fix on my position.

32:33.818 --> 32:36.286
lf this thing's moving as fast
as it was when it pulled me in,

32:36.354 --> 32:38.754
l could be
a long way from Mars by now.

32:40.258 --> 32:42.089
The imager's
been working overtime

32:42.160 --> 32:43.889
cataloguing
all the matter in here,

32:43.962 --> 32:46.430
but a lot of it defies analysis.

32:46.497 --> 32:47.555
l think we're going to need

32:47.632 --> 32:49.099
to make room
on the periodic table.

32:53.438 --> 32:56.498
Where the hell am l?

32:56.607 --> 32:59.007
Power levels have dropped
another 15 percent

32:59.110 --> 33:00.975
since my last systems check.

33:28.339 --> 33:32.833
l... l think l just saw
another spacecraft.

33:32.944 --> 33:34.707
Either that...

33:34.779 --> 33:37.748
or all this dehydrated food
has gone to my head.

33:43.287 --> 33:44.720
l got it.

33:44.789 --> 33:47.087
The hull's made
of some kind of alloy.

33:47.158 --> 33:49.217
l can't make heads
or tails of it.

33:49.293 --> 33:51.488
l shouldn't have been
so dismissive.

33:51.562 --> 33:54.190
l remember
giving Kumagawa a hard time

33:54.265 --> 33:57.428
when she claimed
she saw a UFO over the Gulf.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.935
l told her it was a meteor

34:00.004 --> 34:02.404
or another piece of Muir.

34:02.507 --> 34:05.772
l guess l owe you
an apology, Rose.

34:11.014 --> 34:17.112
Ares lV Mission Record,
October 25.

34:17.188 --> 34:19.213
This has been
a nice place to visit,

34:19.290 --> 34:20.882
but l'm ready to come home.

34:20.992 --> 34:22.619
l've prepped the ion drive,

34:22.693 --> 34:25.286
channeled all the power
from the thruster reserves

34:25.362 --> 34:26.728
into the main tank.

34:26.797 --> 34:31.132
l have enough fuel
for one last engine burn.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.203
Wish me luck.

34:47.418 --> 34:48.942
lgnition sequence.

34:50.855 --> 34:54.484
Five, four, three, two...

34:56.661 --> 35:00.222
l'm losing pitch control.

35:00.298 --> 35:02.061
Gyros aren't responding.

35:03.668 --> 35:04.794
Power failure.

35:04.902 --> 35:06.494
l've got to abort.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.572
l'm not going to make it!

35:19.750 --> 35:23.277
All systems go.

35:23.354 --> 35:24.787
Watch me, Dad.

35:24.856 --> 35:27.290
l'm flying.

35:30.361 --> 35:31.555
Bad landing.

35:31.629 --> 35:33.961
Call the MedEvac team.

35:35.867 --> 35:38.028
Paris to Seven.
Status?

35:38.136 --> 35:40.627
l've located the device,
but it's fused to the hull.

35:40.738 --> 35:41.796
Stand by.

35:41.906 --> 35:42.895
Make it quick.

35:43.074 --> 35:44.564
We've got less than 15 minutes.

35:44.675 --> 35:46.939
Understood.

35:50.515 --> 35:53.313
All systems go.

35:53.384 --> 35:56.785
Watch me, Dad. l'm flying.

36:00.458 --> 36:02.221
Bad landing.

36:02.293 --> 36:04.557
Call the MedEvac team.

36:07.632 --> 36:09.600
John Kelly's first flight...

36:09.667 --> 36:12.101
not exactly A- okay.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.161
Remember that, Dad?

36:14.272 --> 36:16.570
l jumped off the roof

36:16.641 --> 36:18.609
with a parachute
made out of blankets.

36:20.511 --> 36:24.277
l guess l didn't calculate
the aerodynamics.

36:24.348 --> 36:26.339
Of course...

36:26.417 --> 36:28.408
l was only six.

36:28.486 --> 36:33.753
l guess this is
John Kelly's last flight.

36:33.824 --> 36:37.885
This time
l can't blame it on pilot error.

36:38.029 --> 36:41.089
This time... no regrets.

36:41.165 --> 36:45.795
What l've seen... proves...

36:45.903 --> 36:48.303
we were right to come out here.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.465
We're not alone.

36:50.575 --> 36:52.406
l know that now.

36:54.679 --> 36:56.943
The module's losing power.

36:59.016 --> 37:01.985
l'm taking life support
off- line.

37:02.086 --> 37:05.852
Rerouting whatever's left
to the imager.

37:07.592 --> 37:10.925
Keep it running...
as long as possible.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.728
Mission control...

37:15.800 --> 37:18.064
Dad...

37:18.169 --> 37:20.296
whoever finds this...

37:21.839 --> 37:23.773
do me a favor.

37:26.510 --> 37:28.535
Take all the data
l've collected...

37:30.014 --> 37:31.811
put it to good use.

37:34.018 --> 37:36.782
l hope you don't look at this
as a failure.

37:38.689 --> 37:40.554
l don't.

37:40.625 --> 37:42.889
Actually...

37:42.960 --> 37:44.723
l do have one regret.

37:44.795 --> 37:47.593
l never found out...

37:47.665 --> 37:49.530
who won the World Series.

37:54.171 --> 37:56.605
l'm tired.

37:56.674 --> 37:58.232
l can't...

38:16.260 --> 38:17.557
Paris to Seven.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.562
How's it going over there?

38:19.630 --> 38:21.063
l have the distributor.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.225
l'm downloading
Lieutenant Kelly's database.

38:23.301 --> 38:26.327
Hurry, we're running out
of time.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.519
Lock onto my bio- signature
and my combadge.

38:48.592 --> 38:49.854
Seven?

38:49.927 --> 38:51.053
Energize.

39:07.445 --> 39:08.707
Delta Flyer, report.

39:08.779 --> 39:10.770
We're trying to integrate
the distributor.

39:10.848 --> 39:11.974
Stand by, Captain.

39:12.049 --> 39:13.311
How long do they have?

39:13.384 --> 39:15.045
Four minutes.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.216
Try bypassing
the power couplings.

39:19.290 --> 39:20.917
No effect.

39:20.991 --> 39:24.927
Resequence the ion modulators;
see if that does it.

39:26.297 --> 39:29.460
Power conversion
in progress.

39:29.533 --> 39:33.230
We have propulsion, shields.

39:33.337 --> 39:36.101
The plasma flow
is still fluctuating.

39:36.173 --> 39:37.731
Stay on top of it.

39:37.842 --> 39:39.275
Paris to Voyager.

39:39.343 --> 39:40.867
Go ahead.

39:41.011 --> 39:43.275
Open the Shuttle Bay doors;
we're coming home.

39:43.347 --> 39:45.281
Acknowledged.

39:45.349 --> 39:47.476
Laying in an escape trajectory.

39:53.524 --> 39:55.082
The ellipse
is returning to subspace.

39:55.159 --> 39:56.592
The Flyer.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.423
They're approaching
the perimeter...

39:58.496 --> 40:01.260
2,000 meters... 1,800.

40:01.332 --> 40:02.822
The anomaly's submerging.

40:05.269 --> 40:06.327
Are we in tractor range?

40:06.437 --> 40:07.369
Not yet.

40:07.438 --> 40:08.370
Take us closer.

40:08.439 --> 40:09.371
Captain?

40:09.440 --> 40:10.407
Do it.

40:10.508 --> 40:11.497
They are still out of reach.

40:11.609 --> 40:12.541
Another 300 meters.

40:12.610 --> 40:13.577
Closer.

40:13.644 --> 40:14.941
We'll be pulled
right in with them.

40:15.045 --> 40:16.034
Just a few more meters.

40:19.116 --> 40:20.947
We're too close!

40:21.085 --> 40:22.347
l've got a lock.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.820
Reverse thrusters, full impulse.

40:48.245 --> 40:52.181
Captain's Log,
Stardate 53301.2.

40:52.249 --> 40:53.546
The away team collected

40:53.617 --> 40:56.415
over 60 teraquads of data
on the anomaly.

40:56.487 --> 40:58.455
Before we begin
to analyze them,

40:58.522 --> 41:00.888
we've decided
to pay our respects

41:00.991 --> 41:01.923
to an old colleague.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.120
Space...

41:04.195 --> 41:07.289
literally, it means ''nothing''...

41:07.364 --> 41:10.595
a vacuum
between stars and planets.

41:10.701 --> 41:13.135
But by the same token,
it means everything.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.900
lt's what connects
all our worlds- -

41:16.040 --> 41:18.270
Vulcan, Qo'noS,

41:18.342 --> 41:21.072
Talax, Earth.

41:22.346 --> 41:24.280
Centuries ago,

41:24.348 --> 41:28.614
mankind sent its first wave
of explorers into that void.

41:28.686 --> 41:31.177
Astronauts like Mr. Kelly.

41:31.255 --> 41:34.622
They paved the way
for the first colonies,

41:34.692 --> 41:36.626
the first starships.

41:36.694 --> 41:39.492
For those of us
who've made space our home,

41:41.198 --> 41:44.133
We commend
the spirit and the bravery

41:44.235 --> 41:46.897
of Lieutenant John Mark Kelly

41:47.004 --> 41:49.268
as we commit his body...

41:49.340 --> 41:51.604
to space.

41:51.675 --> 41:53.905
He will not be forgotten.

41:53.978 --> 41:56.242
Captain...

42:00.284 --> 42:03.185
l did not know this individual.

42:03.254 --> 42:06.189
Had l encountered him
while l was a Borg,

42:06.257 --> 42:08.589
l would have found
his technology

42:08.659 --> 42:10.354
unworthy of assimilation...

42:12.630 --> 42:15.895
but we are more alike
than one might think.

42:16.033 --> 42:19.628
ln a sense,
his desire to explore

42:19.737 --> 42:22.729
was not unlike
a quest for perfection.

42:22.840 --> 42:26.936
His contribution
helped secure humanity's future,

42:27.044 --> 42:30.241
and in some ways, my own.

42:33.551 --> 42:36.611
The Yankees...

42:36.687 --> 42:39.019
in six games.

42:45.262 --> 42:47.992
All hands, attention.

42:52.202 --> 42:53.965
Honor guard.
