John: <i>Previously on</i> Switched at Birth...

00:01.535 --> 00:03.220
I hate to trash your guy before me, but...

00:03.224 --> 00:05.489
He depreciated more assets than you had.

00:05.506 --> 00:08.342
I'm gonna do everything I
can to make this go away,

00:08.794 --> 00:10.026
but there will be pain.

00:10.042 --> 00:11.362
This doesn't reflect on you.

00:11.379 --> 00:13.777
That's why we hired a professional.

00:13.968 --> 00:15.022
Gabe: What if I said...

00:15.060 --> 00:16.723
That we should adopt a kid together?

00:17.060 --> 00:17.881
What?

00:17.971 --> 00:21.580
_

00:23.044 --> 00:24.327
Whoa! Emmett!

00:24.378 --> 00:28.090
_

00:28.413 --> 00:31.517
_

00:33.401 --> 00:35.282
Daphne: I have the chance to go to Mexico

00:35.317 --> 00:38.251
and give out hearing aids to
people who can't afford their own.

00:38.303 --> 00:39.343
That's great.

00:39.351 --> 00:41.949
And you're an awesome person for doing it.

00:42.467 --> 00:44.224
- Quinn: You have a boyfriend.
- Daphne: Yeah.

00:51.660 --> 00:52.749
I missed you.

00:53.484 --> 00:54.398
Me, too.

00:55.958 --> 00:59.211
Hey, I have something to
tell you about spring break.

01:00.256 --> 01:01.477
Okay.

01:02.038 --> 01:02.939
What?

01:07.140 --> 01:11.549
You are looking at the
2015 South Padre Island

01:11.567 --> 01:15.091
guns and buns contest winner, baby!

01:16.740 --> 01:18.219
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey!

01:18.245 --> 01:20.341
The competition was seriously intense.

01:20.358 --> 01:22.101
Oh, I bet it was fierce!

01:22.101 --> 01:23.372
So what about you?

01:23.381 --> 01:26.540
What sort of crazy stuff
did you get into in Mexico?

01:27.595 --> 01:28.479
Um...

01:28.887 --> 01:30.868
there were no buns

01:30.873 --> 01:32.757
and thankfully there were no guns.

01:32.958 --> 01:33.986
But...

01:34.599 --> 01:36.240
it was kind of life-changing.

01:36.474 --> 01:37.214
Wow.

01:37.334 --> 01:39.446
You can't believe what it's like to see

01:39.465 --> 01:42.532
a little girl hear her mom say
her name for the first time.

01:42.652 --> 01:43.567
It was amazing.

01:43.602 --> 01:45.743
Thanks for making my spring break triumph

01:45.760 --> 01:48.763
- sound a little bit more trivial.
- Aw...

01:51.060 --> 01:53.831
- So, I have a question for you.
- Shoot.

01:53.857 --> 01:57.381
John and Kathryn are having their
world famous grill night tomorrow,

01:57.381 --> 02:00.250
and Kathryn's asked if
I would bring you along.

02:00.633 --> 02:02.312
- Are you up for it?
- (Sighs)

02:02.349 --> 02:04.187
I have dinner tomorrow with the parents.

02:04.438 --> 02:06.192
Attendance is mandatory.

02:06.888 --> 02:09.184
Well, have you ever thought about

02:09.247 --> 02:11.127
maybe bringing them?

02:11.470 --> 02:14.898
You could meet J and K, and
I could meet your parents.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.131
Seriously?

02:16.147 --> 02:17.311
Are you ready for that?

02:18.086 --> 02:19.590
Sure!

02:19.797 --> 02:22.928
Meeting each other's parents
for the first time is so awkward.

02:22.997 --> 02:24.541
Let's just get it over with.

02:24.593 --> 02:25.642
Okay.

02:25.677 --> 02:27.694
I'll ask my parents, but
it sounds like a plan.

02:28.004 --> 02:28.745
Nice.

02:29.003 --> 02:30.747
(Both laugh)

02:33.702 --> 02:35.919
So even if you do get in,

02:35.940 --> 02:37.757
you're not gonna do
the Frida Kahlo program?

02:37.789 --> 02:39.012
She's still my favorite artist,

02:39.044 --> 02:42.360
but I just think that I need
to chart my own artistic path.

02:42.377 --> 02:43.426
- That's all.
- Hmm.

02:43.698 --> 02:46.935
I hear Emmett showed up to surprise Melody.

02:47.620 --> 02:48.816
Yeah...

02:49.018 --> 02:51.463
Rumor has it there were body shots

02:51.505 --> 02:53.802
- and a fist fight involved?
- And um...

02:53.807 --> 02:56.740
A texting incident with his new girlfriend.

02:57.135 --> 03:00.372
- Oh, boy.
- Not that it's an excuse, but...

03:00.393 --> 03:03.035
I think just knowing
he moved on so quickly,

03:03.673 --> 03:06.205
- it kind of messed with me.
- Totally understandable.

03:07.886 --> 03:11.665
Do you think that maybe it's
time for you to do the same?

03:11.785 --> 03:14.077
No. No. I am not ready yet.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.607
And I definitely don't want
to do the rebound thing.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.474
Okay.

03:24.336 --> 03:26.219
<i>♪ I feel lighter now ♪</i>

03:26.271 --> 03:28.355

Hmm? Oh! Sorry.

_

05:09.805 --> 05:12.208
_

05:12.328 --> 05:15.078
I'm not looking to hire him.

05:15.080 --> 05:18.283
I was thinking more
along the lines of a date.

05:18.613 --> 05:19.723
So...

05:20.377 --> 05:23.252
Tell me about the great guy part.

Hello.

05:41.881 --> 05:43.598
No, no, no.

05:43.651 --> 05:46.574
I didn't think you'd be
home for another hour.

05:46.643 --> 05:50.252
_

05:52.203 --> 05:54.084
Oof. Damn.

05:54.382 --> 05:56.669
I didn't think I'd get
so nervous, but I am.

05:58.565 --> 05:59.971
Turning on someone's

06:00.210 --> 06:02.191
ex-husband's cochlear implant

06:02.311 --> 06:04.258
is not the typical way

06:04.779 --> 06:06.379
to meet the love of your life.

06:07.156 --> 06:09.478
But that's what happened to me.

06:10.424 --> 06:11.663
The minute

06:12.317 --> 06:14.395
I met you, I fell hard.

06:14.852 --> 06:16.213
And right now,

06:16.224 --> 06:19.891
there is a kid out there who
is waiting for us to meet her.

06:25.727 --> 06:27.811
Melody Brooke Bledsoe...

06:29.006 --> 06:30.648
Will you marry me?

06:47.005 --> 06:48.384
Yes!

06:54.422 --> 06:56.346
Regina: He asked you? When?

06:56.410 --> 07:00.177
(Laughing) I'm so happy for you! Come!

07:04.567 --> 07:07.065
But I have to say I'm surprised.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.180
I thought you were worried

07:08.180 --> 07:10.056
- about the whole...
- _

07:11.571 --> 07:16.418
_

07:16.487 --> 07:18.150
_

07:18.183 --> 07:19.878
_

07:19.883 --> 07:20.957
You are?

07:21.019 --> 07:22.076
_

07:22.089 --> 07:24.771
Because we talked about
it like... a million times,

07:24.793 --> 07:27.566
how we're both so glad that we
don't have to go through that again.

07:27.587 --> 07:29.017
_

07:29.137 --> 07:31.185
Which I never expected.

07:31.185 --> 07:32.471
Plus, he's nine.

07:32.591 --> 07:35.203
Thank god I don't have to do
that whole baby thing again.

07:35.436 --> 07:37.211
_

07:37.331 --> 07:39.502
_

07:39.502 --> 07:41.633
_

07:42.069 --> 07:43.608
Then I love it!

07:43.728 --> 07:45.056
Try to get a nine-year-old boy!

07:45.062 --> 07:46.646
We'll do play dates with Will!

07:46.672 --> 07:49.727
_

07:49.743 --> 07:52.023
_

07:52.311 --> 07:54.176
Oh, look at us...

07:54.187 --> 07:55.973
you realize they're gonna have to wheel us

07:55.983 --> 07:57.987
into the PTA meetings, right?

07:58.970 --> 08:02.860
_

08:03.715 --> 08:05.798
Oh, god. I hope so.

08:08.887 --> 08:09.836
(Door opens)

08:10.062 --> 08:12.060
Oh, hey! Okay...

08:12.075 --> 08:15.897
So, you know that red top that you have?

08:15.907 --> 08:17.140
It's like, kind of lacey?

08:17.150 --> 08:19.536
- You wore it to the Drake concert?
- Yeah.

08:19.656 --> 08:20.813
I need it.

08:21.184 --> 08:23.055
- For what?
- I met a guy.

08:23.549 --> 08:25.261
- And he asked you out?
- No.

08:25.271 --> 08:28.620
That hasn't happened
yet. But I have a plan,

08:28.624 --> 08:30.773
and that top is part of my plan.

08:30.775 --> 08:32.472
Oh! Well who is he?

08:32.547 --> 08:35.567
You might know him from Carlton, actually.

08:35.571 --> 08:38.696
He's a few years older. Name's Garrett?

08:38.712 --> 08:40.783
- Garrett Banducci?
- Yeah!

08:40.784 --> 08:42.160
That guy's a player.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.501
Huh.

08:43.755 --> 08:44.954
I can roll with that.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.841
Oh, it looks like somebody's
ready to take the plunge.

08:48.877 --> 08:51.202
Yeah it's... it's time.

08:51.383 --> 08:52.977
- Good!
- Oh! And...

08:52.999 --> 08:56.169
If this all works out,
then I am going to have

08:56.171 --> 08:58.132
to take a rain check on grill night...

08:58.132 --> 08:59.434
Are you going?

08:59.743 --> 09:00.699
Yeah.

09:00.819 --> 09:04.574
Mingo is coming to officially meet J and K

09:04.694 --> 09:07.752
and he's bringing his parents.

09:09.793 --> 09:11.414
Whoa! That's big!

09:11.449 --> 09:12.415
I know.

09:12.450 --> 09:14.327
- I'm kind of nervous.
- Oh, please.

09:14.352 --> 09:15.435
They'll love you.

09:17.851 --> 09:19.854
- John: Remind me who he is again.
- Kathryn: Um...

09:19.886 --> 09:21.057
Mingo?

09:21.059 --> 09:22.392
I'm not sure I got the name right.

09:22.592 --> 09:25.128
I think that's the kid
I schooled in butts up.

09:25.248 --> 09:27.295
Don't get your wedding
planner out just yet.

09:27.415 --> 09:29.507
You might have to eat your words.

09:29.879 --> 09:32.969
Do you know how many of my friends
married their college sweethearts?

09:32.971 --> 09:34.604
And we're having his parents over, too?

09:34.614 --> 09:37.086
Whom we know nothing about? Shoot me now.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.975
It's just grill night.

09:39.169 --> 09:42.076
Besides, you know how important
this is to Daphne, so...

09:42.905 --> 09:44.614
I'm sorry. It's just...

09:44.734 --> 09:47.131
We got our first offer
on the car wash today.

09:48.167 --> 09:49.485
Not good, huh?

09:49.521 --> 09:51.962
I don't think "low-ball"
even does it justice.

09:52.005 --> 09:53.020
Well, we don't have to accept it.

09:53.036 --> 09:54.487
I'm sure there will be other offers.

09:54.509 --> 09:57.347
Why did we even have a business
manager for all those years?

09:57.363 --> 09:59.935
I cannot believe the mess Larry put us in.

10:00.466 --> 10:03.320
Okay, right now let's
not let it ruin tonight.

10:03.351 --> 10:04.729
I mean, who knows?

10:04.739 --> 10:07.083
We may be meeting Daphne's future in-laws.

10:11.192 --> 10:14.077
Do you think it's okay that I brought wine?

10:14.079 --> 10:15.374
I didn't want to come empty-handed,

10:15.395 --> 10:17.441
but I don't want your parents to

10:17.462 --> 10:20.380
think I'm like... like a
booze hound or something.

10:20.412 --> 10:23.362
Oh, my god, you're nervous.

10:23.580 --> 10:24.787
Aw.

10:26.339 --> 10:28.691
- Don't worry.
- Kathryn: There they are! Hey!

10:28.701 --> 10:29.741
- Hi, Mom!
- Hi, honey.

10:30.164 --> 10:31.249
Hi, sweetie.

10:31.796 --> 10:33.863
- Nice to see you again.
- Good to see you, sir.

10:34.318 --> 10:36.482
Oh! I heard this is good.

10:36.534 --> 10:38.235
Oh, that's really thoughtful.

10:38.298 --> 10:40.386
And your signing is getting good!

10:40.422 --> 10:43.439
- Thanks.
- So, um... Mingo?

10:43.441 --> 10:45.909
- Is that your first name?
- It's a nickname.

10:45.922 --> 10:48.059
My actual name is Greg.

10:48.090 --> 10:49.378
Greg Shimingo.

10:51.416 --> 10:52.720
Shimingo?

10:53.400 --> 10:57.129
Your dad's not Larry
Shimingo, the business manager?

10:57.452 --> 10:58.643
You know my dad?

11:01.026 --> 11:02.091
(Doorbell)

11:04.965 --> 11:07.935
- John, Kathryn...
- Oh, we've met.

11:08.382 --> 11:10.725
Daphne: Wow. What a small world.

11:10.845 --> 11:11.889
Hi, Larry.

11:11.958 --> 11:13.781
Hello, John, Kathryn.

11:14.230 --> 11:16.730
I don't think that we've met. I'm Kathryn.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.038
Nancy.

11:18.492 --> 11:19.518
Thank you.

11:20.156 --> 11:22.169
How do you all know each other?

11:22.523 --> 11:26.483
Larry used to be our business manager.

11:26.657 --> 11:28.234
No way!

11:28.514 --> 11:29.718
Used to be?

11:30.126 --> 11:31.106
Yeah.

11:31.662 --> 11:33.010
Used to be.

11:39.711 --> 11:42.875
Look, we had no idea it was you.

11:43.104 --> 11:44.865
We didn't put it together until Greg

11:44.869 --> 11:46.772
texted the address on the way over.

11:47.621 --> 11:48.975
Is there a problem?

11:49.095 --> 11:51.945
Oh, no. It's totally fine. Right, Mom? Dad?

11:54.536 --> 11:57.094
Honey, why don't you serve the appetizers?

11:57.140 --> 11:58.217
- Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

11:58.232 --> 12:00.075
You guys follow me out back,

12:00.096 --> 12:02.555
and John and Kathryn
will get dinner started.

12:12.694 --> 12:15.123
Our daughter is dating
Larry Shimingo's son?

12:15.143 --> 12:16.894
You have got to be kidding me!

12:17.014 --> 12:18.304
How did we not know this?

12:18.340 --> 12:19.734
How were we supposed to know?

12:19.763 --> 12:22.442
It's not like we run background
checks on all her boyfriends.

12:22.477 --> 12:23.813
Well, we have to start.

12:23.866 --> 12:25.078
What am I supposed to do?

12:25.113 --> 12:26.997
- Make nice with that guy?
- You have to.

12:27.034 --> 12:29.353
But... why don't we
just send them all home?

12:29.377 --> 12:31.181
Okay, fine. Then you tell Daphne

12:31.205 --> 12:32.842
why you have a problem with Larry

12:33.185 --> 12:34.749
'cause you're the one
who said you didn't want

12:34.769 --> 12:37.276
the kids to know about
our financial problems.

12:37.396 --> 12:38.640
No. I don't.

12:39.191 --> 12:40.786
Then you put on a good face,

12:40.906 --> 12:42.219
I'll handle Nancy,

12:42.301 --> 12:43.672
and we'll get through this night.

12:44.162 --> 12:45.285
Okay?

12:45.885 --> 12:46.864
Fine.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.274
Hey!

12:56.476 --> 12:58.460
_

12:58.580 --> 13:00.930
I'm canvassing the local businesses.

13:00.966 --> 13:04.734
Trying to convince the Cracked Mug
that we should start doing take-out.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.584
_

13:09.057 --> 13:10.544
Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out.

13:10.565 --> 13:13.149
So, I thought I would go around, you know?

13:13.165 --> 13:15.431
See what the people
around here like to eat.

13:15.517 --> 13:18.020
You know, sandwiches, pasta, burgers...

13:18.057 --> 13:19.927
Is that the kind of thing

13:19.934 --> 13:23.559
that you or your coworkers
would like to order?

13:24.630 --> 13:26.099
_

13:26.219 --> 13:26.873
Huh.

13:27.185 --> 13:28.463
Good to know.

13:28.583 --> 13:29.920
I will tell them.

13:30.659 --> 13:32.929
_

13:33.855 --> 13:35.227
Well, I better get back to work.

13:35.268 --> 13:39.583
I only have a few more
hours until I'm off, so...

13:40.697 --> 13:43.608
_

13:43.618 --> 13:46.407
_

13:46.461 --> 13:47.248
Hmm.

13:47.742 --> 13:48.542
Dinner...

13:49.392 --> 13:51.670
_

13:51.694 --> 13:53.042
_

13:53.491 --> 13:54.914
Seven. Hm...

13:55.082 --> 13:56.969
Um... yeah... no, no. Yeah, sure.

13:57.005 --> 13:58.225
Yeah. Why not?

13:58.299 --> 14:00.629
- _
- All right. See you then.

14:08.605 --> 14:10.503
Mingo: Our dads hate each other.

14:10.623 --> 14:12.719
- What do you think happened?
- Daphne: I don't know.

14:12.754 --> 14:15.148
But we're not letting
this turn into a disaster.

14:15.268 --> 14:18.115
The two of us will run interference
all night if we have to.

14:18.152 --> 14:19.107
Roger that.

14:19.912 --> 14:21.868
Daphne: Hey, guys! Who's hungry?

14:23.631 --> 14:25.818
Gary: Melody started her own deaf program.

14:25.855 --> 14:29.313
She was the guidance counselor at
a deaf high school for 16 years.

14:29.342 --> 14:30.204
(Laughs nervously)

14:30.265 --> 14:33.212
Which is all in the application.

14:34.690 --> 14:35.901
Interpreter: "And Gabe has...

14:35.933 --> 14:37.485
spent the last nine months...

14:38.415 --> 14:39.906
working full-time for a charity."

14:39.947 --> 14:42.286
Counselor: You're both
very impressive candidates.

14:42.352 --> 14:45.662
So I will set up individual
as well as joint interviews,

14:45.691 --> 14:47.887
and that's followed up
by a home inspection.

14:50.344 --> 14:51.303
Interpreter: "That's great.

14:51.931 --> 14:53.711
We're very, very patient.

14:54.196 --> 14:56.763
We know how the placement
process can take a long time."

14:56.951 --> 14:59.927
I have... I have friends
who waited for two years.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.249
Did they want a white baby?

15:03.638 --> 15:04.600
Uh...

15:05.106 --> 15:07.955
- You know, I'm not sure.
- Well, that's probably why.

15:07.959 --> 15:10.694
The waiting list is quite
long for healthy white infants.

15:10.727 --> 15:12.127
But you've indicated

15:12.135 --> 15:13.743
that you're open to a
wide range of children.

15:13.756 --> 15:14.772
Absolutely.

15:15.446 --> 15:16.315
Interpreter: "Of course."

15:16.435 --> 15:18.924
In my experience, this could
move along really quickly.

15:20.707 --> 15:21.637
Interpreter: "How quickly?"

15:21.757 --> 15:24.401
Counselor: Well, if you're truly
flexible as you indicated...

15:24.597 --> 15:26.463
Well, I've had some cases
where I've placed a child

15:26.479 --> 15:27.879
in a matter of weeks.

15:28.479 --> 15:29.912
Gabe: That's awesome!

15:30.214 --> 15:31.324
Weeks, honey!

15:35.979 --> 15:37.103
Interpreter: "That's crazy!"

15:38.004 --> 15:39.196
(Exhales)

15:45.504 --> 15:47.114
Those ribs look killer.

15:47.159 --> 15:47.811
(Laughs)

15:47.846 --> 15:49.934
Best griller in KC, right?

15:49.955 --> 15:50.983
Watch the sauce.

15:50.995 --> 15:52.464
You don't want to burn those bad boys.

15:52.550 --> 15:53.978
You know, Larry, I think I've had enough

15:54.011 --> 15:55.705
of your advice to last me a lifetime,

15:55.708 --> 15:56.484
thank you very much.

15:56.501 --> 15:59.432
- Yeah? Well maybe if you took it for once...
- Mingo: Hey, Dad,

15:59.552 --> 16:02.281
you've gotta hear this story
of how me and Daphne first met.

16:02.289 --> 16:05.538
Daphne: Yeah! It was last
semester at the dorm triathlon.

16:05.583 --> 16:07.791
Let's just say, we did not get along.

16:07.832 --> 16:09.608
You see, your son was trying to

16:09.616 --> 16:11.298
bend the rules just a bit.

16:11.314 --> 16:13.760
I guess the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.903
(Scoffs) That's rich coming from you.

16:15.948 --> 16:17.046
(Laughs awkwardly)

16:17.471 --> 16:18.193
Larry,

16:18.222 --> 16:21.185
you were always a little jealous
of us ball players, weren't you?

16:21.226 --> 16:22.691
Oh, I don't know.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.296
I seem to remember back in the day

16:24.316 --> 16:26.328
it was me carrying you up and down

16:26.345 --> 16:27.990
the basketball court at the club.

16:28.259 --> 16:30.724
Daphne: I play basketball!
You guys played together?

16:31.085 --> 16:33.411
Yeah. Larry and I were
on the country club team.

16:33.485 --> 16:34.922
- No way!
- Yeah.

16:34.966 --> 16:36.975
We even won the two-on-two
tourney one year.

16:37.004 --> 16:39.582
- Hey! Let's play a little two-on-two, huh?
- Yeah!

16:39.591 --> 16:41.538
You guys can get the old team back together

16:41.559 --> 16:43.126
and play me and Daphne.

16:43.967 --> 16:45.057
Yeah.

16:46.572 --> 16:47.809
Sounds good.

16:48.670 --> 16:49.817
I'm game.

16:52.744 --> 16:54.251
And... and how old is the mother?

16:55.275 --> 16:56.467
And... and are they healthy?

16:57.337 --> 16:58.321
Uh-huh...

16:59.313 --> 17:00.492
Uh-huh...

17:01.239 --> 17:03.154
yeah. I'll talk to her right away.

17:03.387 --> 17:05.277
- Thank you.
- (Phone beeps)

17:05.506 --> 17:06.477
Oh, my god.

17:07.375 --> 17:10.963
A birth mother in Chicago
saw our profile and loved us.

17:11.001 --> 17:12.580
_

17:12.585 --> 17:14.502
She has twins. Two months old.

17:14.569 --> 17:15.752
A girl and a boy.

17:15.776 --> 17:17.674
One is deaf, the other's hearing.

17:17.699 --> 17:19.806
They're African-American and healthy.

17:19.826 --> 17:23.145
She already has two kids, which is
why she can't take care of these.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.909
_

17:26.936 --> 17:28.150
_

17:28.166 --> 17:30.280
No. She wants them to stay together.

17:32.767 --> 17:34.391
_

17:34.436 --> 17:36.395
How many times did you
say that you felt bad

17:36.395 --> 17:37.882
that Emmett was an only child?

17:38.062 --> 17:41.152
I would love for our kid to have a sibling.

17:41.764 --> 17:44.732
_

17:44.753 --> 17:46.275
No. But this way,

17:46.471 --> 17:50.297
we would get to really bond
with them through every phase.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.738
_

17:54.697 --> 17:56.901
_

17:56.987 --> 17:59.021
I know, I know, but we would be

17:59.141 --> 18:01.906
a great bi-racial family.

18:01.972 --> 18:06.826
This patchwork of deaf,
hearing, black, white...

18:17.910 --> 18:19.457
Their names...

18:20.159 --> 18:22.388
Are Gigi and Otis.

18:22.604 --> 18:25.653
And she's sending us pictures tonight.

18:26.318 --> 18:27.800
Can we just look at them?

18:28.594 --> 18:29.693
Please?

18:33.136 --> 18:34.814
_

18:34.883 --> 18:36.202
_

18:37.440 --> 18:38.950
Gigi and Otis.

18:47.576 --> 18:52.149
It's so cool that I get to take
you to your first art opening.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.068
_

18:53.125 --> 18:55.456
_

18:55.534 --> 18:58.485
_

18:59.020 --> 19:00.907
Fun is good.

19:01.599 --> 19:04.395
Don't ask yourself, "what is this about?"

19:04.515 --> 19:05.732
Ask yourself,

19:05.797 --> 19:09.292
"what does this make me feel or think of?"

19:09.353 --> 19:12.627
What do you think that the
artist felt while making it?

19:13.382 --> 19:15.209
Or at least...

19:15.254 --> 19:16.604
That's what I do.

19:17.483 --> 19:20.087
_

19:20.777 --> 19:23.312
I could talk about art all night.

19:24.916 --> 19:27.019
_

19:27.084 --> 19:29.978
_

19:29.998 --> 19:31.880
_

19:32.458 --> 19:33.859
Okay.

19:34.357 --> 19:36.745
_

19:36.780 --> 19:39.850
_

19:47.730 --> 19:49.411
Sorry to keep you guys waiting.

20:06.030 --> 20:06.961
Hey.

20:07.659 --> 20:08.520
Hey.

20:10.116 --> 20:12.468
Garrett, uh... this is...

20:12.588 --> 20:13.513
Tank.

20:13.574 --> 20:14.656
Miles.

20:14.897 --> 20:17.529
I don't play football anymore.

20:18.297 --> 20:18.978
Right.

20:19.007 --> 20:20.986
Um... Sorry... um...

20:21.044 --> 20:23.015
Miles. Miles.

20:23.068 --> 20:25.138
Miles, this is Garrett.

20:26.023 --> 20:26.966
Hey.

20:28.114 --> 20:29.551
I didn't know you worked here.

20:29.579 --> 20:30.432
Yeah.

20:31.334 --> 20:32.440
Here I am.

20:34.459 --> 20:35.395
How are you?

20:35.636 --> 20:36.623
I'm good.

20:37.325 --> 20:38.579
Well, I'm okay.

20:40.110 --> 20:41.041
I'm fine.

20:43.731 --> 20:44.960
Well, so... uh...

20:45.080 --> 20:46.940
let me get you two some water

20:47.177 --> 20:50.594
and... I'll be right back
to tell you the specials.

20:51.055 --> 20:52.325
You don't have to do that.

20:52.369 --> 20:54.692
Yeah no, I'll get in
trouble if I don't, so...

20:54.812 --> 20:56.447
Right. Of course.

20:57.537 --> 20:59.297
Sorry. Thank you.

21:00.501 --> 21:02.542
_

21:04.032 --> 21:05.444
He, uh...

21:06.930 --> 21:08.457
_

21:08.577 --> 21:09.380
Kind of.

21:09.698 --> 21:11.090
It's complicated.

21:11.466 --> 21:14.568
_

21:17.426 --> 21:20.169
_

21:20.475 --> 21:21.149
Waiter: Hi there.

21:21.161 --> 21:22.949
Miles had an emergency
he needed to tend to,

21:22.982 --> 21:24.231
so I'll be taking over for him.

21:24.398 --> 21:25.656
Are you all ready with your drink order,

21:25.660 --> 21:26.713
or do you want another minute?

21:28.505 --> 21:29.395
Another minute.

21:29.440 --> 21:30.391
Okay.

21:33.051 --> 21:34.221
Could you excuse me?

21:34.641 --> 21:35.931
_

21:42.760 --> 21:43.699
Tank!

21:44.177 --> 21:47.201
- I have to be somewhere.
- Please talk to me.

21:53.076 --> 21:54.758
What do you want to talk about?

21:55.844 --> 21:56.999
How are you?

21:58.677 --> 21:59.685
Really?

22:02.213 --> 22:05.278
Okay. So you're working as a waiter.

22:05.290 --> 22:07.867
What's wrong with that?
I'm working as barista.

22:09.043 --> 22:12.036
Let's just say it's not the career
path I thought I'd be on right now.

22:12.312 --> 22:14.056
So you'll chart another one.

22:15.411 --> 22:16.240
Okay.

22:16.538 --> 22:18.159
- No! Wait.
- (Sighs)

22:18.159 --> 22:19.510
Are you in school?

22:19.845 --> 22:20.601
No.

22:21.756 --> 22:24.853
After I got expelled I
applied to a bunch but

22:25.209 --> 22:26.569
none would take me.

22:27.229 --> 22:28.331
Right.

22:31.054 --> 22:32.886
This is why I didn't want
to get into this with you.

22:33.135 --> 22:35.340
It's gonna sound like I'm
giving you a guilt trip.

22:35.460 --> 22:37.440
- I'm not.
- No!

22:37.504 --> 22:41.117
Look, I was affected by what happened, too.

22:42.071 --> 22:43.826
Emmett and I broke up.

22:44.292 --> 22:47.749
I'm taking this class at
UMKC, and everywhere I go

22:47.934 --> 22:50.008
people on campus keep whispering about me.

22:50.013 --> 22:52.146
But I keep telling myself that

22:52.391 --> 22:54.131
it doesn't have to define me.

22:54.438 --> 22:56.162
And that's true for you, too.

22:58.673 --> 23:00.436
That's what I thought.

23:02.015 --> 23:02.933
And then...

23:03.053 --> 23:05.770
I got set up with this
girl who I really liked

23:06.862 --> 23:08.485
and she Googled me.

23:09.347 --> 23:10.689
And that was it.

23:11.659 --> 23:13.449
It was over before it started.

23:14.828 --> 23:16.859
Do you know what it's like to realize

23:17.272 --> 23:18.619
that for the rest of your life,

23:18.696 --> 23:20.410
when someone searches your name,

23:20.650 --> 23:23.063
the word "rape" comes up next to it?

23:25.915 --> 23:27.421
I'm sorry.

23:28.212 --> 23:29.110
No,

23:30.397 --> 23:31.682
I'm sorry.

23:34.019 --> 23:35.642
I'm really sorry.

23:40.030 --> 23:41.765
I've imagined saying that

23:41.985 --> 23:44.399
a hundred times in the past few months.

23:45.730 --> 23:47.200
I would do anything

23:47.562 --> 23:50.370
to go back in time and do that night over.

23:51.370 --> 23:52.594
Anything.

23:52.895 --> 23:53.931
Me, too.

24:02.601 --> 24:03.876
Tank.

24:05.202 --> 24:07.157
We both made mistakes.

24:10.085 --> 24:11.907
It doesn't mean our lives are over.

24:14.459 --> 24:15.995
Feels like mine is.

24:19.149 --> 24:20.783
(Car engine starts)

24:38.585 --> 24:40.335
This is gonna be perfect.

24:40.381 --> 24:42.219
We'll let them win, and then by the end

24:42.245 --> 24:44.490
- of the dinner, they'll be besties.
- Sweet.

24:45.153 --> 24:47.607
Okay, so dads versus kids.

24:47.727 --> 24:50.000
- First team to 21 wins.
- John: Whoa.

24:50.383 --> 24:51.792
I've got a better idea.

24:52.031 --> 24:54.919
How about Shimingos versus the Kennishes?

24:55.039 --> 24:57.292
Losers gotta wash the dishes.

24:57.328 --> 24:58.690
- But we said...
- Hold on.

24:59.629 --> 25:00.879
You're on.

25:02.364 --> 25:03.410
You're on him.

25:05.150 --> 25:06.380
- You ready?
- Yeah.

25:06.416 --> 25:08.013
- Check it!
- Oof!

25:08.437 --> 25:09.488
Yeah.

25:10.825 --> 25:12.152
Come on.

25:13.499 --> 25:14.397
You know,

25:14.418 --> 25:17.893
Greg is the first young man that
Daphne's brought home to meet us.

25:19.112 --> 25:20.653
(Clears throat)

25:21.178 --> 25:23.102
They're great together, don't you think?

25:23.481 --> 25:24.424
Mm-hmm.

25:24.460 --> 25:26.699
Greg's in sports management.

25:26.756 --> 25:29.078
Does that mean he wants
to be a sports agent

25:29.088 --> 25:32.075
- or a physical therapist?
- He's not sure.

25:35.372 --> 25:37.726
Daphne's in pre-med.

25:37.762 --> 25:39.544
She's got a long haul ahead of her,

25:39.551 --> 25:41.483
but if anybody can do it, she can.

25:43.884 --> 25:45.112
So...

25:45.316 --> 25:47.842
I heard that Larry cut back.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.672
Is he enjoying his time off?

25:49.724 --> 25:50.923
No.

25:50.975 --> 25:52.608
What do you mean?

25:52.610 --> 25:54.048
He didn't cut back.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.512
Well, that's what he told John.

25:56.564 --> 25:59.119
That he was cutting back on
his clients, downsizing...

25:59.150 --> 26:01.528
Oh. Well, he only said that to
stop working with your husband.

26:02.386 --> 26:03.533
Excuse me?

26:10.498 --> 26:12.754
That's my girl! Yeah, baby!

26:12.874 --> 26:14.483
Would it kill you to play a little defense?

26:14.544 --> 26:16.049
- Come on, son!
- Dad, she's my girlfriend.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.953
It's not the NBA playoffs.
And take it down a notch.

26:17.963 --> 26:19.504
- Take it out.
- Hold up.

26:19.535 --> 26:20.612
Hold up. Hold on. What?

26:20.647 --> 26:21.591
What do you mean, "what?"

26:21.632 --> 26:23.571
You make it, you take
it. You know the drill.

26:23.691 --> 26:25.729
Old school rules, baby. Come on.

26:25.849 --> 26:27.643
But Mr. Shimingo's right.

26:27.684 --> 26:29.945
We scored. It's their turn.

26:29.981 --> 26:31.301
Come on. Play nice.

26:31.317 --> 26:33.832
No. We don't need any favors.

26:33.868 --> 26:36.237
You take it out, Daphne. Go ahead. Come on!

26:36.461 --> 26:39.136
Check it. Here we go. Come on.

26:48.877 --> 26:51.133
Yeah! Get that weak sauce outta here!

26:51.199 --> 26:52.746
Dad, take it easy! Geez.

26:52.786 --> 26:54.032
- Foul.
- What?

26:54.062 --> 26:55.419
- Yeah.
- So we're calling fouls now?

26:55.420 --> 26:57.109
It's a pick-up game, for god's sakes!

26:57.139 --> 26:58.104
John: It's a foul!

26:58.145 --> 27:01.482
I'm starting to think
basketball was a mistake.

27:02.125 --> 27:04.713
You know what? I'm gonna put this
aside for the night, for the kids' sake.

27:04.743 --> 27:06.264
What are you putting aside?

27:06.285 --> 27:09.010
The fact that your husband
put us close to financial ruin.

27:09.025 --> 27:10.173
Oh? Is that what John told you?

27:10.199 --> 27:11.305
That it was Larry's fault?

27:11.326 --> 27:14.147
We have been told that he made
terrible errors in judgment...

27:14.178 --> 27:16.336
writing things off that the
government would never allow,

27:16.362 --> 27:18.194
depreciating assets massively,

27:18.225 --> 27:21.356
- understating income...
- Which your husband directed him to do.

27:21.799 --> 27:24.522
- No.
- Oh, please!

27:24.642 --> 27:27.073
Larry anguished for years
about John's demands.

27:27.073 --> 27:28.789
He was always trying
to stay one step ahead,

27:28.795 --> 27:30.229
always in fear that he would get caught,

27:30.270 --> 27:32.581
and finally I said,
"enough. Get rid of John.

27:32.701 --> 27:34.668
"Tell him you're downsizing.
Whatever. Just get out."

27:34.714 --> 27:36.761
John would never do
that. He is not a cheater.

27:36.776 --> 27:38.639
Uh-huh. And then he told all
his buddies with the Royals

27:38.685 --> 27:41.499
to stop working with Larry because
Larry was the incompetent one?

27:41.619 --> 27:42.231
You know what, Nancy?

27:42.256 --> 27:44.072
There must be some misunderstanding here.

27:44.255 --> 27:45.869
Or someone's being lied to.

27:52.712 --> 27:53.936
Yes! Tie game.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.512
No basket! No basket!

27:55.586 --> 27:56.455
You were out of bounds.

27:56.496 --> 27:58.783
- Oh, come on. I was not.
- You stepped over the line!

27:58.844 --> 27:59.951
Are you accusing me of cheating?

27:59.977 --> 28:01.712
- You said it. Not me.
- Come on, guys.

28:01.752 --> 28:04.202
- It's just a game.
- Let's just play the points again.

28:04.574 --> 28:05.978
I don't cheat.

28:06.008 --> 28:06.896
Oh, really?

28:06.896 --> 28:09.284
Every April 15th you're kind
of an expert on the matter.

28:09.335 --> 28:11.177
And because of that, I'm pretty much broke.

28:11.243 --> 28:12.672
So thank you, Larry!

28:12.723 --> 28:14.806
- Thank you for all your expert advice.
- Hey!

28:14.826 --> 28:17.573
If you're broke, that's
your fault, not mine!

28:17.605 --> 28:18.670
John, what's going on?

28:18.683 --> 28:20.264
You told me you had ways
of working the angles

28:20.292 --> 28:22.465
and you could cover losses
by working the gray area.

28:22.481 --> 28:23.661
- Remember that?
- John?

28:23.702 --> 28:24.764
Yeah. And because of you,

28:24.780 --> 28:26.323
I lost a whole bunch of other clients!

28:26.352 --> 28:27.731
I was just warning my friends!

28:27.764 --> 28:29.798
You know, at least Larry
had the decency not to trash

28:29.830 --> 28:32.216
- your name to them.
- John would never do anything illegal.

28:32.239 --> 28:33.643
There must be one misunderstanding.

28:33.684 --> 28:34.994
- There's no misunderstanding.
- No, no, no.

28:35.006 --> 28:37.509
You were crystal clear for 20 years.

28:37.542 --> 28:39.416
- For 20 years!
- You told me you could make it work!

28:39.441 --> 28:40.588
You would have nothing to do with it?

28:40.600 --> 28:42.768
My hands are dirty,
you're clean as a whistle.

28:42.784 --> 28:44.846
You never once told me
that we crossed the line!

28:44.911 --> 28:46.014
Stop!

28:46.397 --> 28:47.764
What is happening?

28:47.772 --> 28:49.756
This is supposed to be a great evening

28:49.765 --> 28:51.883
and you're all just yelling at each other.

28:55.934 --> 28:57.510
Maybe we should end the night

28:57.862 --> 28:59.946
before things get any worse.

29:00.958 --> 29:02.105
I agree.

29:12.235 --> 29:13.545
Your ribs are burning.

29:19.114 --> 29:20.110
I'll text you.

29:33.953 --> 29:37.133
- John...
- That man is not welcome in this house.

29:37.253 --> 29:39.586
And for that matter, neither is his kid.

29:40.431 --> 29:42.783
Did you ask Larry to cheat?

29:42.903 --> 29:45.460
I never asked Larry to do anything illegal.

29:46.849 --> 29:47.747
But...

29:47.939 --> 29:48.942
But what?

29:49.245 --> 29:51.278
We have a great life, Kathryn. Okay?

29:51.298 --> 29:52.315
And that comes at a cost.

29:52.356 --> 29:53.732
I was just trying to make things work.

29:53.741 --> 29:55.304
No! I won't accept that.

29:55.459 --> 29:56.800
We wanted nice things,

29:56.818 --> 29:58.896
so you had to break the
rules to keep us happy?

29:58.924 --> 30:00.684
You don't think every
single person in this country

30:00.704 --> 30:02.774
doesn't write off an
extra thing here or there?

30:02.826 --> 30:05.659
Or bend the rules just a
little bit in their favor?

30:05.692 --> 30:08.116
Would you really want our
kids to hear you say that?

30:08.129 --> 30:10.411
That cheating is okay
because everyone else does it?

30:10.443 --> 30:11.978
Larry was the expert.

30:12.015 --> 30:14.330
If what I was asking for was so bad,

30:14.521 --> 30:16.106
he should've just said no, okay?

30:16.130 --> 30:17.714
And yeah, maybe I pushed him a little,

30:17.734 --> 30:19.677
but it was up to him to push back.

30:20.355 --> 30:24.470
Not everyone is comfortable
pushing you back, John.

30:29.679 --> 30:31.495
I didn't think of it as cheating.

30:32.308 --> 30:33.414
I really didn't.

30:35.264 --> 30:36.562
We have to tell Bay and Toby.

30:36.590 --> 30:39.065
I don't want them finding
out the way that Daphne did.

30:39.599 --> 30:40.945
They have to hear it from us.

30:42.522 --> 30:43.159
Oh,

30:43.567 --> 30:44.682
and one more thing.

30:45.167 --> 30:47.308
As long as our daughter is dating that boy,

30:47.821 --> 30:49.870
he is welcome in this house.

30:59.566 --> 31:00.368
Mom.

31:05.769 --> 31:07.388
I'm so sorry.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.663
How is this gonna work?

31:09.827 --> 31:12.451
How do I date a guy that my parents hate?

31:13.227 --> 31:15.251
You father's relationship with Larry

31:15.268 --> 31:17.076
has nothing to do with you two.

31:17.867 --> 31:19.170
We'll work it out.

31:19.603 --> 31:20.811
And by the way,

31:21.187 --> 31:23.388
I really like Mingo.

31:25.094 --> 31:26.086
Me, too.

31:29.152 --> 31:31.577
Is it true that you and John are having...

31:32.062 --> 31:34.059
financial issues?

31:34.899 --> 31:35.789
Yes.

31:36.749 --> 31:39.928
We didn't see the point in worrying you.

31:40.128 --> 31:41.541
I feel so bad.

31:41.859 --> 31:43.513
I lost that scholarship.

31:43.531 --> 31:44.878
I should have worked harder.

31:45.066 --> 31:46.454
We're gonna be okay.

31:46.682 --> 31:48.042
I promise.

31:49.349 --> 31:50.304
You sure?

31:51.463 --> 31:52.231
I'm sure.

31:52.941 --> 31:54.178
Now do me a favor.

31:54.247 --> 31:55.631
Go back to school

31:55.660 --> 31:57.680
and put this night out of your mind,

31:58.024 --> 31:59.174
and please

31:59.774 --> 32:00.897
don't worry.

32:14.033 --> 32:15.323
Oh, hey!

32:15.752 --> 32:17.776
_

32:17.824 --> 32:20.576
_

32:20.588 --> 32:23.421
Uh... not if she wants to stay in business.

32:23.882 --> 32:26.491
I'm just finishing up
installing a new speaker system.

32:26.536 --> 32:28.940
Oh! Congratulations, by the way.

32:29.103 --> 32:32.348
Engagement and adoption? I
mean... wow, that's amazing.

32:32.369 --> 32:33.904
_

32:35.495 --> 32:36.787
I know that face.

32:37.808 --> 32:40.674
That's the "what the
hell just happened" face.

32:41.122 --> 32:46.090
_

32:47.127 --> 32:49.336
_

32:49.357 --> 32:50.361
Honestly,

32:50.687 --> 32:53.079
if someone would've told me six months ago

32:53.121 --> 32:54.803
that I was gonna be a dad

32:54.819 --> 32:56.371
to a Down syndrome kid,

32:56.375 --> 32:58.349
I would've told them they were nuts.

32:58.808 --> 33:00.323
But now it's just

33:00.547 --> 33:02.266
my new reality.

33:02.386 --> 33:04.531
_

33:04.569 --> 33:06.222
- _
- Hey,

33:06.924 --> 33:09.612
I feel like I'm too young to do it,

33:09.732 --> 33:11.404
you feel like you're too old...

33:12.624 --> 33:14.192
No perfect time, I guess.

33:16.184 --> 33:17.568
How's Gabe?

33:18.764 --> 33:22.389
_

33:22.396 --> 33:26.236
Hey, well, maybe his
excitement will be enough to

33:26.356 --> 33:29.074
carry you through until you find yours.

33:31.595 --> 33:35.077
_

33:36.543 --> 33:42.111
_

33:44.319 --> 33:48.164
_

33:48.605 --> 33:50.267
Hey, no problem.

33:53.333 --> 33:55.348
Bay: He just seemed so sad.

33:57.455 --> 33:58.855
He was manipulating you.

33:58.867 --> 34:01.717
No, he wasn't. I had to drag it out of him.

34:03.484 --> 34:05.419
I feel really bad for him.

34:06.052 --> 34:07.010
Bay!

34:07.587 --> 34:11.239
What happened to Tank after he
assaulted you is not your responsibility.

34:11.791 --> 34:12.476
I know.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.199
You should not feel guilty for him

34:14.208 --> 34:15.764
having to face those consequences.

34:15.780 --> 34:17.434
- Okay.
- Sweetie...

34:18.728 --> 34:20.543
I understand the

34:21.303 --> 34:22.369
desire

34:22.940 --> 34:25.376
to want to make everyone
like you and to try to

34:25.496 --> 34:28.639
- make everything okay...
- We were friends.

34:30.001 --> 34:31.850
For a long time.

34:32.344 --> 34:35.291
I know who he is. He's a good
person who made a mistake.

34:35.315 --> 34:37.158
Which he has to live with.

34:37.174 --> 34:39.067
Why is it so wrong for
me to want to help him?

34:41.505 --> 34:42.856
That is

34:43.420 --> 34:45.264
a very kind impulse,

34:45.284 --> 34:47.106
and I respect you for having it,

34:47.668 --> 34:50.755
but sometimes, things get broken.

34:51.645 --> 34:53.636
And they can't be put back together.

34:54.821 --> 34:56.576
This is one of those times.

34:57.591 --> 35:00.082
I hope he gets back up on his feet,

35:01.047 --> 35:03.598
but this is not for you to fix, Bay.

35:04.077 --> 35:05.910
You need to let this be.

38:27.429 --> 38:30.276
is totally between them and
it has nothing to do with us.

I have to tell you something.

38:53.728 --> 38:55.776
I kissed someone in Mexico...

38:55.948 --> 38:58.025
Or he kissed me, but...

38:59.832 --> 39:01.278
It happened.

39:02.728 --> 39:05.734
- So what does that mean?
- Nothing.

39:06.025 --> 39:09.046
We were just on this big adventure

39:09.102 --> 39:12.302
and excited that we had
a breakthrough with Pati...

39:12.659 --> 39:14.745
But, it didn't mean anything.

39:14.774 --> 39:16.513
Was it with that... that audiologist guy?

39:16.570 --> 39:17.341
Quinn?

39:18.358 --> 39:19.015
Yeah.

39:19.669 --> 39:22.603
He travels the world
working with that charity.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.469
I'm probably never gonna see him again.

39:28.282 --> 39:29.321
Do you forgive me?

39:29.441 --> 39:30.477
Are we okay?

39:35.221 --> 39:38.822
If you say there's nothing
to worry about, then...

39:39.722 --> 39:40.479
Yeah.

39:40.638 --> 39:42.932
- I believe you.
- There is nothing to worry about.

39:44.129 --> 39:44.858
Yeah.

39:44.978 --> 39:45.806
Okay.

39:46.717 --> 39:47.787
Good.

39:48.930 --> 39:50.297
Uh...

39:51.700 --> 39:53.053
I gotta get to class.

39:53.816 --> 39:55.089
Okay. I'll see you later.
