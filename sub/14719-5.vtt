[music playing]

00:20.360 --> 00:21.160
Ted.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.120
Oh, my god.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.120
[theme music playing]

00:34.240 --> 00:35.120
SINGER: Watch your back.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.440
Watch your back.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.200
When you're walking
down the alleys.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.200
Try to watch your
back, watch your back,

00:40.320 --> 00:44.120
when you're out on the streets.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.600
I met a stranger on
a street these days.

00:46.720 --> 00:49.120
You can't see it through
the fog and haze.

00:49.240 --> 00:52.120
Well, everybody's going crazy.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.080
Everybody's going crazy.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.520
Everybody's going crazy.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.040
Hello, Bilkey.

01:05.160 --> 01:05.960
Not tonight.

01:06.080 --> 01:06.880
Piss off.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.680
Thanks for meeting me.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.600
What is it that's
so important?

01:15.720 --> 01:17.440
How does $100,000 sound?

01:17.560 --> 01:18.720
It's a security van.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.480
So the garage I've
been working at,

01:20.600 --> 01:23.080
it's got the job servicein all the security vans.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.680
And some days at
the end of the run

01:24.800 --> 01:27.640
there's easily $100,000 inthe back of the van, sometimes

01:27.760 --> 01:29.080
way more.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.040
Knowing how much is
inside is tempting,

01:32.160 --> 01:33.720
but it's not a lot of help.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.240
You think about
it, security vans are

01:36.360 --> 01:37.760
just like safes with wheels.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.800
But the thing about safesis they're usually standing

01:39.920 --> 01:42.600
still when you open them.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.800
And this bird has magicallygot the keys to the van.

01:45.920 --> 01:46.920
Not quite.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.200
I rigged the door
latch mechanism

01:48.320 --> 01:49.440
so that if I pull on
the wheel, it comes

01:49.560 --> 01:52.800
out through the wheel latch.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.560
This is Bert
we're talking about.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.680
That dirty knock.

01:55.800 --> 01:58.000
And you reckon
he's on the level?

01:58.120 --> 02:04.640
If I were a betting man, I'dsay yeah, but you're the boss.

02:04.760 --> 02:07.560
But you said you wanted therolls of fabric for the ladies

02:07.680 --> 02:08.800
to make their dresses.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.520
No one around here
wears this stuff.

02:10.640 --> 02:12.880
Are you being
racist to my fabric?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.480
That one and that one.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.840
The rest you can flog
off where it came from.

02:16.960 --> 02:20.920
Man you whisker me nothing butproblems and sleepless nights.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.120
I'm the one giving
you sleepless nights?

02:23.240 --> 02:24.040
Well, Wolf.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.200
Falani, there are two
ways of doing this.

02:30.320 --> 02:35.640
You tell me now or you tell melater after you've suffered.

02:35.760 --> 02:37.400
OK, I choose now.

02:44.680 --> 02:45.680
I know about this, man.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.560
It's all good.

02:47.680 --> 02:52.520
When you're with me, you'rean honorary [inaudible]..

02:52.640 --> 02:54.840
Wolf?

02:54.960 --> 02:55.880
Anne-Marie?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.880
Wow, look at you.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.480
You grew up.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.240
So did you.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.320
Where are you going?

03:02.440 --> 03:05.120
To Babes to see the babes.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.880
Do you like disco?

03:07.000 --> 03:07.760
Nah.

03:07.880 --> 03:08.760
Disco sucks.

03:08.880 --> 03:09.680
Come with us.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.840
Think [inaudible]
to sing about 9:00

03:23.960 --> 03:28.560
to 5:00ers The
[inaudible] hypocrite

03:28.680 --> 03:31.040
just got dirty social climber.

03:41.120 --> 03:44.520
Wolf has a girlfriend?

03:44.640 --> 03:45.920
I guess you could
say they're going out.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.120
She's a real girl,
what, that Anne-Marie.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.160
Anne-Marie?

03:53.280 --> 03:54.920
That was her name, yes.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.840
Anne-Marie Gibbs,
Dougal's daughter.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.120
Dougal from the
Magic Roundabout.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.760
Little

04:00.880 --> 04:03.440
Anne-Marie the wallflower whowouldn't say boo to a ghost.

04:03.560 --> 04:07.080
If that is her, than
she has changed a bit.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.640
So for [inaudible]
on your son, will

04:09.760 --> 04:10.680
you buy the rest of the fabric?

04:10.800 --> 04:12.480
No.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.840
So I hear you've beenseeing a bit of Anne-Marie.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.120
Anne-Marie Gibbs.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.240
She's a nice girl.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.080
Is she?

04:21.200 --> 04:24.240
Apparently, her and our sonwere out all night last night.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.520
Really?

04:25.640 --> 04:27.280
I wouldn't believe
everything Falani says.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.040
You were out all night?

04:29.160 --> 04:30.760
So were you.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.360
I'm not the one who's
still in bloody school.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.360
School's a waste of time.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.400
Well, the way Maldoon
and his blue fascists

04:36.520 --> 04:38.880
are ruining the country,you'll need all the education

04:39.000 --> 04:40.880
you can get to get a job.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.240
Dad, the sort of
jobs I'll be doing you

04:42.360 --> 04:44.600
don't need school for.
And you know it.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.240
Yeah?

04:46.360 --> 04:48.480
Well, you didn't exactlycover yourself in glory when

04:48.600 --> 04:50.240
I tried to teach you, did you?

04:50.360 --> 04:54.960
I'll beat this fucking safe.

04:55.080 --> 04:57.880
So you'll be staying in schooltill we say you can leave.

04:58.000 --> 04:58.920
That's bullshit.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.040
Don't you swear
at your father.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.000
You do.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.200
You might think it's allfun and games now, young man.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.400
But if you're going to
play this game properly,

05:06.520 --> 05:08.360
then you'll need to get
smarter than the cops.

05:08.480 --> 05:12.920
So it's school or
borstal, Your choice.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.320
But I'll tell you one
thing for nothing.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.080
No bloody son of mine
is going to borstal.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.760
We must get Anne-Marie
over for dinner.

05:24.880 --> 05:25.960
I haven't see her in ages.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.480
Thanks for agreeing to see me.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.240
I needed to look
you in the eye.

05:42.360 --> 05:43.600
OK, I get that.

05:43.720 --> 05:45.520
Are you still in
McCarthy's pocket?

05:45.640 --> 05:47.640
Not since your wife
tried to kill me.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.880
Fair enough.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.040
How is Rita?

05:51.160 --> 05:51.960
It's good.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.440
Thanks.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.720
So what did you tell Bilkey?

05:56.840 --> 05:58.480
Was that on the level?

05:58.600 --> 06:01.840
I'd never lie to you, Ted.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.000
I miss you guys so much.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.400
I miss everything
that we used to have.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.920
I miss the sound
of Phineas's voice.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.280
I miss the cologne Lefty wears.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.960
I get it, Bert.

06:12.080 --> 06:12.960
I want to make things right.

06:17.840 --> 06:22.000
All my notes, everything,you can have it.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.800
It's useless to me
without you guys.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.720
There's a couple of problems.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.840
The first one, time.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.600
Even if we get
away with the van,

07:12.720 --> 07:14.040
the guards will
have walkie talkies.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.560
So the pigs will becrawling all over the place

07:15.680 --> 07:18.800
while we're driving, sticking
out like dogs' balls.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.320
The time it will take to get thedoors open, transfer the loot.

07:21.440 --> 07:22.680
So it's off then?

07:22.800 --> 07:25.040
Unless we speed up
the process by relieving

07:25.160 --> 07:26.720
the guards of both
their walkie talkies

07:26.840 --> 07:28.040
and the keys to the kingdom.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.600
How do you propose we do that?

07:29.720 --> 07:32.480
With a little friend I liketo call my 12-gauge shotgun.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.600
No, no guns.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.600
We don't do armed robbery.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.320
Never have, never will.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.200
You're the boss.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.320
So is it on or is it off?

07:45.440 --> 07:46.880
I'm confused.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.280
Second problem.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.760
Bert, can we trust him?

07:49.880 --> 07:51.200
And the info he
gave us checks out.

07:51.320 --> 07:54.520
I personally think
he's on the level.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.800
But if anyone here is worried,we knock it on the head.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.640
I kind of miss the
little [inaudible]..

08:00.760 --> 08:02.360
Well, if he's
bullcrapping us, Lefty

08:02.480 --> 08:04.720
can use his shotgun on him.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.080
If you're good
with Bert, I'm good.

08:12.160 --> 08:16.480
[music playing]

08:16.600 --> 08:17.760
About time.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.000
Just because they're
married doesn't mean

08:19.120 --> 08:20.560
they own the bloody country.

08:20.680 --> 08:21.960
So you're on the
side of the cops then?

08:22.080 --> 08:23.600
I'm on the side
of all the people

08:23.720 --> 08:25.240
who think you can't
just build a few shacks

08:25.360 --> 08:27.960
and call the land yours.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.800
Hi, Rita.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.560
You after another
beer, Phineas?

08:31.680 --> 08:32.640
Yeah.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.560
No, I'm good.

08:34.680 --> 08:35.760
I've been talking to Carol.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.400
Oh.

08:37.520 --> 08:41.080
Having some real good chatsand walks, walking and talking.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.760
At the same time?

08:42.880 --> 08:43.760
Yeah.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.080
Yeah.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.880
It think And almost
ready to come back home.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.240
Has she said anything
to you about it?

08:51.360 --> 08:54.480
I haven't spoken
to Carol for ages.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.480
Well, anyways I reckon
it's looking good.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.200
I just thought you
might want to know.

08:59.320 --> 09:00.120
Thanks.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.400
I hope it all works out.

09:01.520 --> 09:02.280
Me too.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.720
Good luck with those
used goods, Phineas.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.160
[knocking]

09:11.280 --> 09:12.520
Anne-Marie, come in.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.400
Hi, I got invited over.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.440
Great.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.400
Rita.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.440
Dougal, long time, no see.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.400
Bless you.

09:26.520 --> 09:29.600
Wolf, wow, you've grown.

09:29.720 --> 09:30.640
[inaudible]

09:30.760 --> 09:31.680
Hello, Dougal.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.640
Looking good as ever.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.040
I hope you don't
mind, but punky monkey

09:36.160 --> 09:37.280
said she was coming over.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.960
Don't call me that.

09:39.080 --> 09:41.600
And I thought I haven't seenTed and Rita in [inaudible],,

09:41.720 --> 09:43.200
not since Janine shot through.

09:43.320 --> 09:45.040
It's quite all right, Dougal.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.960
Have you heard
from Janine lately?

09:47.080 --> 09:48.400
No.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.840
A bloke I know said hesaw her working at a club

09:50.960 --> 09:55.320
in King's Cross, which shouldbe about right for a whore.

09:55.440 --> 09:58.720
And this is little Sparky.

09:58.840 --> 10:01.560
Yes, not so little now.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.960
Say hello.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.800
Hello.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.280
He doesn't talk
much, I'm afraid.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.680
It's quite all right.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.600
Ted's out the back
if you want a word.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.120
Oh, cheers, Rita.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.280
[inaudible] for you.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.760
Come on, lump.

10:19.880 --> 10:23.240
So how are you, Anne-Marie?

10:23.360 --> 10:24.720
You want a beer, Dougal?

10:24.840 --> 10:25.600
Huh?

10:25.720 --> 10:26.760
Do you want a beer?

10:26.880 --> 10:27.640
Oh, no, no.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.920
I'm off the Grog.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.880
I've got to keep a clear head.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.240
Now it's just me
looking after my family

10:33.360 --> 10:36.280
after the bitch
fucking abandoned us.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.400
Yeah.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.560
Yeah, sorry to
hear about Janine.

10:40.680 --> 10:41.800
So how's it going?

10:41.920 --> 10:45.000
Oh, yeah, not
so good, you see,

10:45.120 --> 10:49.360
which is why I was hoping fora quiet word, just you and me,

10:49.480 --> 10:50.520
like.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.400
Yeah, sure.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.080
So how's school going?

11:03.200 --> 11:05.160
The woodwork class broke down.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.240
OK.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.520
The thing is, Ted,
work at the quarry

11:11.640 --> 11:14.280
has been a bit quiet lately.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.000
So they've been cutting back.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.960
And then some bastard
pointed the finger

11:18.080 --> 11:19.480
at me for punchy stuff.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.960
So I ended up getting the elbow.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.160
It's bloody tough
out there these days.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.200
And Anne-Marie has gone
all strange, all right?

11:26.320 --> 11:30.160
And the school expelled the boy,even though there's no proof

11:30.280 --> 11:32.240
that he started the fire.

11:32.360 --> 11:33.640
Yeah, it's though.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.160
It's real tough.

11:35.280 --> 11:38.000
So what I'm getting at,Ted, if you got anything going

11:38.120 --> 11:40.320
at the moment, and you're
looking for a bloke who

11:40.440 --> 11:42.800
knows his way around--

11:42.920 --> 11:46.200
Unfortunately, mate, we'vegot nothing at the moment.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.720
Otherwise, you'd be
the first guy I called.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.640
Right.

11:48.760 --> 11:49.600
Sorry.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.040
No, no, no.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.520
Worth a shot, aye?

11:53.640 --> 11:54.720
Thanks for thinking of me.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.160
Yeah, you got it, Dougal.

11:57.280 --> 11:58.760
Chin up, aye?

11:58.880 --> 12:00.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.080
So why is it called punk?

12:03.200 --> 12:04.480
I don't know.

12:04.600 --> 12:08.840
It just is because that'swhat we are, punks.

12:08.960 --> 12:09.960
Right.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.360
I don't expect
you to understand.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.560
It's not up to
me to understand.

12:13.680 --> 12:14.560
I'm just checking that you do.

12:14.680 --> 12:15.520
Come on, love.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.320
We've got to go.
- You go.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.280
I'm staying.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.360
Right.

12:21.480 --> 12:22.400
OK.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.680
Suit your self.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.720
Oh, we can dropAnne-Marie home tomorrow.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.120
Don't get ahead
of yourself, tiger.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.480
I'll leave when I want to.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.000
I thought you
might want to stay.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.440
I'll drop Anne-Marie homewhen we've finished our chat,

12:34.560 --> 12:35.360
won't I?

12:42.880 --> 12:45.880
What did Dougal want?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.120
A job.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.960
So why didn't
you give him one?

12:49.080 --> 12:50.800
Look, figuring out
how to shave time

12:50.920 --> 12:52.160
getting the van doors open.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.680
Then Dougal Gibbs walks
through the bloody door.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.240
Somebody's sending
us a message, Ted.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.800
You think McCarthy
got wind of the job.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.400
No, Phineas.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.640
I think when the guy who canblow those doors in a second

13:00.760 --> 13:01.840
turns up, you don't
send him away.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.280
It's bloody Dougal, Lefty.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.880
The guy is not exactly stable.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.720
But he knows his shit whenit comes to blowing shit up.

13:20.720 --> 13:21.840
Hello, stranger.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.120
Hi.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.760
Glad you could come.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.120
It was good to
hear your voice.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.760
And yours.

13:29.880 --> 13:33.240
And I hear you've beentalking to Phineas again.

13:33.360 --> 13:37.480
Yeah, sort of.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.000
He's kind of
got his hope's up.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.760
Has he?

13:40.880 --> 13:44.040
I just got to the stage,
you know, where I really

13:44.160 --> 13:45.440
needed someone to talk to.

13:45.560 --> 13:48.320
And the best person
I could think of,

13:48.440 --> 13:51.520
well, the only person
really was Phin.

13:51.640 --> 13:52.760
That's nice.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.480
But I just need to
know if he's getting

13:54.600 --> 13:55.840
these hopes up for nothing.

13:55.960 --> 13:56.840
That's all.

13:59.480 --> 14:04.520
I've been with heaps and heapsof guys, Rita, so many guys.

14:04.640 --> 14:08.520
And none of them
are like Phineas.

14:08.640 --> 14:13.160
And when I'm with a guy now, allI can think about is Phineas.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.840
His cock's got this littlebend in it even when it's hard.

14:15.960 --> 14:19.280
And it just fits perfectly.

14:19.400 --> 14:24.040
Me and him, we just
fit perfectly together.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.280
I'm tired, Rita.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.400
I'm tired of being alone.

14:31.640 --> 14:32.400
Oh, love.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.920
Sorry about the
state of things.

14:52.040 --> 14:55.240
You know what it's likewith two bloody kids, aye?

14:55.360 --> 14:59.320
Well, I suppose you wouldn'tbecause you've only got one.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.760
And Rita's a bloody marvel.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.400
There's a job if you want it.

15:05.520 --> 15:06.840
Really?

15:06.960 --> 15:09.600
I need someone who canblow a door quick, clean,

15:09.720 --> 15:10.880
no damage to what's inside.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.240
Oh, yeah, a piece
of piss, easy.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.880
This is big, Dougal.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.800
There's no room for stuff-ups.

15:18.920 --> 15:21.720
Well, I'm your man.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.120
Yes, you are.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.160
Good day, love.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.400
Good day, Rita.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.280
Nice of you to ask me for tea.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.720
You're very welcome.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.360
Are we expecting someone else?

15:36.480 --> 15:37.240
We are.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.160
Hi.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.160

15:42.280 --> 15:43.080

15:46.360 --> 15:48.520
You look beautiful.

15:48.640 --> 15:49.600
So do you.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.560
Carol dropped by the
shop today, Phineas.

15:54.680 --> 15:57.560
She was saying how much
she missed your company.

16:00.880 --> 16:04.480
She wants to get
back together again.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.040
She's standing right
over there, Phineas.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.280
Do want to get back together?

Screw them.

17:14.480 --> 17:15.520

20:01.520 --> 20:02.880
I said no guns.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.240
Get some clothes on.

23:59.560 --> 24:00.880
Where's your father?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.040
I don't know, work.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.720
Why?- None of your fucking business.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.640
What do you know about it?
- About what?

24:05.760 --> 24:06.840
You know.

24:06.960 --> 24:07.840
No.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.120
If I did, I wouldn't tell you.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.960
Loser father, loser son, aye?

24:11.080 --> 24:13.080
Get away from my son?

24:13.200 --> 24:13.960
What happened, Ted?

24:14.080 --> 24:15.320
What went wrong?

24:15.440 --> 24:16.520
No idea what
you're talking about.

24:16.640 --> 24:19.480
Do you have a
warrant to be here?

24:19.600 --> 24:21.080
What happened, Ted?

24:21.200 --> 24:22.160
About what?

24:22.280 --> 24:23.280
Get him out of here.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.840
What are you're
arresting us for?

24:24.960 --> 24:26.160
I'm not.

24:26.280 --> 24:28.680
He's assisting us
with our inquiries.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.400
And if you have a
problem with that, Rita,

24:30.520 --> 24:32.360
I'll come after you
as an accessory,

24:32.480 --> 24:33.960
ruin the life for
the both of you.

24:47.280 --> 24:48.520
Anne-Marie, you need to go home.

24:48.640 --> 24:49.400
What's happened?

24:52.000 --> 24:53.400
Go.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.160
I'm sorry, Mr. McCathy.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.960
As I have repeatedly
said, I have no idea

24:58.080 --> 24:58.920
what you're talking about.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.880
What went wrong, Ted?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.640
It's not your style to leavea dead body after the fact.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.560
Which may explain why I haveno clue what you're on about?

25:06.680 --> 25:10.680
Jeez, a dead body, that'spretty drastic, Mike.

25:10.800 --> 25:11.880
Wasn't a cop, was it?

25:15.440 --> 25:16.320
Watch your mouth.

25:16.440 --> 25:17.200
No.

25:17.320 --> 25:18.600
Sorry.

25:18.720 --> 25:20.560
Wish I could help, but I can't.

25:20.680 --> 25:21.760
Sorry.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.960
[inaudible] dead
bodies in my yard.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.920
Then maybe you shouldbury them in someone else's.

25:29.640 --> 25:31.440
I don't know nothing
about anything.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.600
Where were you this morning?

25:33.720 --> 25:34.680
Nope, nothing.

25:34.800 --> 25:35.600
Listen, you dumb shit.

25:35.720 --> 25:36.920
Tell me, or I'll--

25:37.040 --> 25:37.880
I'm not dumb.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.520
Don't call me dumb.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.760
You just hit a
fucking cop, you idiot.

25:41.880 --> 25:44.400
Ted, this is a man
with his head blown off.

25:44.520 --> 25:46.080
And deep in my waters,
I know you're involved.

25:46.200 --> 25:51.280
And if you are, our niceties areover, and I will crucify you.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.840
One of your young
cops out there

25:52.960 --> 25:53.920
said something about a shoddy.

25:54.040 --> 25:56.080
Is that right?

25:56.200 --> 26:00.720
Does that really
sound like me, Mike?

26:00.840 --> 26:04.080
I see you fellas fell
down the stairs too.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.720
This is all your
fucking fault.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.120
If you'd stuck to the plan,none of this would have fucking

26:07.240 --> 26:08.720
happened.
- Piss off.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.840
You want to point fingers,point them at Ted.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.880
[inaudible] lost his [inaudible]to [inaudible] bloody Dougal.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.160
The stupid bastard wouldn'thave blown his own head off.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.720
Is that how you
want to play it?

26:23.440 --> 26:25.640
Anything have anything
they need to tell me?

26:25.760 --> 26:27.040
Like what, Ted?

26:27.160 --> 26:29.600
Like anything theymight have told McCarthy?

26:29.720 --> 26:31.160
Nah, not me.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.920
Not a thing.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.080
Where's the money?

26:34.200 --> 26:35.160
Hidden.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.400
You happy?

26:36.520 --> 26:37.520
You happy with the take?

26:37.640 --> 26:38.720
Don't start
playing games, Ted.

26:38.840 --> 26:39.640
It's a job.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.400
Don't overthink it.

26:41.520 --> 26:43.720
What about Bert?

26:43.840 --> 26:45.360
Where's he?

26:45.480 --> 26:46.280
He should be here, right?

26:46.400 --> 26:47.200
So where is he?

26:47.320 --> 26:48.600
I think he knocked again.

26:48.720 --> 26:49.880
- Oh, man.
- [inaudible] to Bert.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.200
No.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.800
Lefty, you've done
more than enough today.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.720
Who is it?

27:03.840 --> 27:04.800
It's me.

27:04.920 --> 27:05.680
Come in.

27:05.800 --> 27:09.040
Thank god.

27:09.160 --> 27:12.800
I'm freaking out,
waiting for the cops.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.400
They didn't take you in?

27:15.520 --> 27:20.040
Nah, nothing They took you in?

27:20.160 --> 27:24.640
Yeah, all of us, except you.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.400
Man, you didn't
want to say anything?

27:26.520 --> 27:28.240
[inaudible] say
no, I believe them.

27:32.240 --> 27:33.960
So how come they
haven't taken you in?

27:37.600 --> 27:39.720
I see where you're
going with this.

27:39.840 --> 27:41.400
And what I'm thinking
is they think because

27:41.520 --> 27:43.040
of our last
misunderstanding where

27:43.160 --> 27:46.520
your wife tried to kill me,that I'm not your boy anymore.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.200
I think that's a fairassumption on their part.

27:48.320 --> 27:50.960
Yeah, and if they
do come calling?

27:51.080 --> 27:52.880
I'll say nothing,
because I was there.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.680
I saw you covered inblood and brains and shit.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.520
And just being there,
that's 10 years.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.840
Unless you cut a deal.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.320
I'll say nothing, Ted.

28:00.440 --> 28:01.280
I swear.

28:12.840 --> 28:13.640
You OK?

28:16.640 --> 28:18.520
Are we safe?

28:18.640 --> 28:19.440
I think so.

28:22.920 --> 28:23.800
Bert?

28:23.920 --> 28:25.800
Yeah, even Bert.

28:25.920 --> 28:27.720
I think he's more scared
of you than the cops.

28:36.760 --> 28:40.960
Anne-Marie was herewhen you were taken away.

28:41.080 --> 28:44.960
She was with Wolf doing
what young people do.

28:45.080 --> 28:45.880
I told her to go home.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.960
I couldn't tell her herfather was dead because she'd

28:51.080 --> 28:54.120
know that we knew.

28:54.240 --> 28:59.720
So I looked her in the eyeand I told her to go home.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.600
Cops would have
ID'd the body by now.

29:01.720 --> 29:04.040
And they will have told her.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.360
And she would have told them.

29:06.480 --> 29:08.000
I can't do
anything about that.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.320
I know.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.240
I know.

29:16.280 --> 29:17.160
Come to bed.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.800
If I'd known you
were coming, I'd

29:39.920 --> 29:41.240
have tidied up after the cops.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.160
Just wanted to make sureyou and Sparky are OK.

29:48.280 --> 29:50.760
Make sure we
hadn't seen anything.

29:50.880 --> 29:52.840
You knew, and you left
it to some constable

29:52.960 --> 29:56.800
to come here and tell
us my father's is dead.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.760
Don't worry, we didn't spill.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.120
But I know what dad was doing.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.520
He was happy for once,
proud to be working

30:04.640 --> 30:07.920
with the great Ted West.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.040
You know, if you say
any of this out loud,

30:11.160 --> 30:13.000
things will get worse, right?

30:13.120 --> 30:14.000
Can they?

30:14.120 --> 30:17.120
Yeah, very much so.

30:17.240 --> 30:21.160
But they can also get
better starting now.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.840
You two are not staying here.

30:22.960 --> 30:24.880
Do we have a choice?

30:25.000 --> 30:27.640
Do you see anyone else
coming to your rescue?

30:27.760 --> 30:28.560
Get your stuff.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.320
This is a really bad idea.

30:46.440 --> 30:50.240
Last time I checked,compassion wasn't a crime.

30:50.360 --> 30:53.440
Anything you know of
directly connecting you?

30:53.560 --> 30:54.440
Apart from the money?

30:54.560 --> 30:56.280
Apart from that.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.480
No.

30:57.600 --> 31:01.200
Yes, Anne-Marie,
and maybe Sparky.

31:01.320 --> 31:02.760
It's hard to tell.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.840
So we're better to keep them.

31:04.960 --> 31:09.240
Oh, Jesus, Rita, having
that reminder every day?

31:09.360 --> 31:12.600
Not your fault.
Keep saying that.

31:19.200 --> 31:23.360
All right, Sparky, firstroom on the left, that's yours.

31:23.480 --> 31:30.600
Anne-Marie, you can
sleep wherever you like.

31:30.720 --> 31:32.120
How long can we stay?

31:32.240 --> 31:33.040
As long as you like.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.520
And you and I need
to organize a funeral.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.120
Trust me, that won't be hard.

31:40.240 --> 31:41.360
[music playing]

31:41.480 --> 31:43.680
SINGER: Luck's on
your table tonight.

31:49.000 --> 31:55.040
Only you made out
21 years or so.

31:55.160 --> 32:01.920
Getting all the answers
to a man on the road.

32:02.040 --> 32:08.400
To be cheated with roses whenthe card's laid face down--

32:08.520 --> 32:10.240
Something on your
conscience, Ted?

32:13.680 --> 32:15.400
My son knows his daughter.

32:15.520 --> 32:17.440
He was someone I knew.

32:17.560 --> 32:18.880
Don't over read it, Mike.

32:19.000 --> 32:19.800
I don't think I am, Ted.

32:56.400 --> 32:57.160
Shit.

33:11.160 --> 33:11.960
Get out of the car.

33:17.400 --> 33:21.400
You're Ted West, right?

33:21.520 --> 33:22.800
Who wants to know?

33:22.920 --> 33:25.760
You've beeninstrumental in the death

33:25.880 --> 33:28.200
of an associate of ours.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.720
No.

33:29.840 --> 33:33.200
Dougal got the fuckingexplosive from us, numbskull.

33:33.320 --> 33:34.960
Half his share
was ours by right.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.720
Well, I'll put the word
out, see what I can do.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.280
You'll more than that.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.040
We've got a full
[inaudible] right now.

33:45.160 --> 33:46.200
There's a question of tribute.

33:46.320 --> 33:47.080
Tribute?

33:47.200 --> 33:48.240
Yeah.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.120
And how much tribute
are you talking?

33:50.240 --> 33:51.000
All of it.

33:54.960 --> 33:55.960
We'll get back to you soon.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.280
I mean, we know
where to find you,

34:00.400 --> 34:02.520
right, you and your family?

34:10.760 --> 34:13.960
I had no idea you had anythingto do with the horseman.

34:14.080 --> 34:16.400
Thank you, Phineas, for
that genius observation.

34:16.520 --> 34:19.560
The horseman can get fucked.

34:19.680 --> 34:21.400
Oh, and how's that, Lefty?Why?

34:21.520 --> 34:23.080
Because we got a shotgun now?

34:23.200 --> 34:25.760
Because we're not forking over$200,000 because they say so.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.200
$200,000 grand?

34:27.320 --> 34:31.040
$212,000 [inaudible],,
that's the count.

34:31.160 --> 34:33.080
I'm not walking
away from $40,000

34:33.200 --> 34:36.200
because some punk on amotorbike says so. $35,000

34:36.320 --> 34:38.160
with Dougal's share.

34:38.280 --> 34:39.400
Dougal screwed up.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.280
He doesn't get a share.

34:40.400 --> 34:41.960
And what about his kids?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.720
Well, serves him right forhaving an idiot for a father.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.000
Sorry if the truth hurts, Ted.

34:49.200 --> 34:50.920
Where do you want to go?

34:51.040 --> 34:54.240
I don't know, away from
here, somewhere where

34:54.360 --> 34:55.520
there's just the two of us.

34:55.640 --> 34:57.040
Like a deserted island.

34:57.160 --> 34:58.960
Yeah, that'll be good.

34:59.080 --> 35:01.960
Where we wouldn't even
have to wear clothes.

35:02.080 --> 35:04.440
I'm liking this
better and better.

35:04.560 --> 35:09.680
Hey, You're a mate
of Ted West, right?

35:09.800 --> 35:11.400
Who wants to know?

35:11.520 --> 35:13.400
I got a message for him.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.400
[yelling in pain]

35:30.320 --> 35:34.400
Baby, baby, baby, come on.

35:49.920 --> 35:51.640
They broke her jaw, Ted.

35:56.920 --> 36:01.880
The next one of those whore'sbastards I see, they're dead.

36:25.080 --> 36:26.760
Didn't know they
were still open.

36:26.880 --> 36:27.680
No, they're not.

36:27.800 --> 36:28.600
Just need a word.

36:28.720 --> 36:29.920
Fair enough.

36:30.040 --> 36:31.640
I need the money.

36:31.760 --> 36:32.560
Your share?

36:32.680 --> 36:33.800
All of it.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.720
Why?

36:35.840 --> 36:37.400
It's cursed.

36:37.520 --> 36:38.720
Cursed?

36:38.840 --> 36:40.880
Where is it?

36:41.000 --> 36:41.880
You know our system--

36:42.000 --> 36:43.160
I'm well aware of our system.

36:43.280 --> 36:46.120
But I need the
money now, tonight.

36:46.240 --> 36:47.600
Go home.
Think about this.

36:47.720 --> 36:48.480
We'll talk tomorrow.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.560
No, this needs to be--

36:50.680 --> 36:51.800
No, it doesn't.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.720
The alternatives
are we die or we all
