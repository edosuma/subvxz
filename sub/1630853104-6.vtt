WEBVTT

00:01.175 --> 00:02.480
Previously onHalo...

00:02.524 --> 00:04.395
You kidnapped me.

00:04.439 --> 00:05.744
I will explain everything.

00:05.788 --> 00:07.181
-Cortana!

00:07.224 --> 00:09.139
Shutting down neural bridge.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.445
Dr. Halsey was in my home

00:10.488 --> 00:12.186
and my parents
were still alive.

00:12.229 --> 00:13.578
She'’s been lying to me.

00:13.622 --> 00:15.102
I will look
into this personally.

00:15.145 --> 00:16.929
You promised the committee

00:16.973 --> 00:18.496
that Cortana would keep 1-1-7
under control.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.281
He will operate as designed

00:20.324 --> 00:23.066
and he will bring us the weapon
that wins this war.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.243
Incoming.

00:29.855 --> 00:32.032
John, you'’re going
to have to bring it to us.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.033
Roger that.

00:35.557 --> 00:36.906
-Ah!

00:38.995 --> 00:41.389
-Kai'’s hurt.
-Chief, don'’t do this.

00:41.432 --> 00:42.955
You need
to protect the artifact.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.827
I can'’t let her die.

00:51.094 --> 00:53.096
Chief... the artifact.

01:10.809 --> 01:13.160
Chief,
I'’m reading a human life-form.

01:33.615 --> 01:34.964
Can it be our secret?

01:39.795 --> 01:41.840
-Let me go!
-You will save all of us.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.112
Aren'’t you the lucky one.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.474
Actually, I'’m the lucky one.

02:12.436 --> 02:15.570
Stay calm, Kai.
We got you.

02:15.613 --> 02:16.658
We got you.

02:19.878 --> 02:22.142
It'’s wearing off.
Hit her again.

02:22.185 --> 02:24.535
Don'’t fight it, Kai.

02:24.579 --> 02:26.798
-Kai, let go!

02:26.842 --> 02:28.365
Shit!

02:29.888 --> 02:31.803
Pain'’s too much. Again.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.287
It'’s gonna be okay.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.115
That'’s good.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.725
That'’s good, Kai.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.207
Master Chief?

02:44.251 --> 02:45.861
Master Chief, you'’re ill.

02:45.904 --> 02:47.471
Contact with
the larger artifact

02:47.515 --> 02:49.430
has overloaded your system.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.345
Leave me alone.

02:51.388 --> 02:54.174
I can'’t do that.
It'’s my job to protect you.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.740
You need medical attention.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.569
Chief?

02:59.918 --> 03:01.268
Captain.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.448
Ground sensors were unable

03:07.491 --> 03:10.059
to track the vector
of the Covenant ship

03:10.102 --> 03:12.801
before she went into slipspace
over Eridanus.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.369
It'’s my fault.

03:15.412 --> 03:16.848
I lost us the artifact, sir.

03:16.892 --> 03:19.895
You saved 150 lives,

03:19.938 --> 03:21.984
mine included.

03:22.027 --> 03:24.987
More lives will be lost
if we don'’t get it back.

03:25.030 --> 03:27.729
You found it once,
you'’ll find it again.

03:30.688 --> 03:31.950
Now we have her.

03:52.710 --> 03:54.843
Before she passed out,

03:54.886 --> 03:56.279
she told Miranda
that the Covenant

03:56.323 --> 03:58.107
had kidnapped her as a child

03:58.150 --> 04:00.065
and kept her prisoner
ever since.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.244
You all right?

04:06.071 --> 04:08.639
-You had a systems check?
-No, sir, I'’m fine.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.337
I'’ve run a systems check,

04:10.380 --> 04:12.208
and that'’s absolutely not true.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.297
I'’ll be fine.

04:14.341 --> 04:17.126
Captain, we are on
final approach to Reach.

04:17.169 --> 04:19.084
UNSC hospital ship Solace
has landed

04:19.128 --> 04:21.304
and is unloading
the dead and wounded.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.480
Very well, Lieutenant.
Bring us in.

04:23.524 --> 04:26.309
-Aye, sir.

04:26.353 --> 04:29.094
We'’ll regroup,
come up with a new plan.

04:29.138 --> 04:30.574
Yes, sir.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.972
We need to get you well, Chief.

04:42.673 --> 04:43.674
Can it be our secret?

05:59.228 --> 06:01.535
Tell me what'’s going on.

06:01.578 --> 06:03.275
Thought you knew everything.

06:03.319 --> 06:05.669
What do you know
about Roman Quinn?

06:05.713 --> 06:08.759
Roman 2474 to 2544.

06:08.803 --> 06:11.327
Aeronautic engineer
and ship designer. Hey!

06:11.371 --> 06:12.981
John?

06:13.024 --> 06:15.723
Quinn was no ordinary
shipbuilder.

06:15.766 --> 06:17.899
-He modernized the entire fleet.

06:17.942 --> 06:20.118
-John?
-But his real genius

06:20.162 --> 06:23.252
was in recognizing the limits
to his own intelligence.

06:23.295 --> 06:24.427
Weird, right?

06:24.471 --> 06:26.168
Open this door right now!

06:26.211 --> 06:28.083
Why did you
lock Dr. Halsey in her lab?

06:28.126 --> 06:30.346
See, Quinn knew
that all technology,

06:30.390 --> 06:33.218
no matter how advanced,
can go bad,

06:33.262 --> 06:35.612
so you gotta have
a fail-safe.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.397
He built fail-safes
into all of his tech,

06:37.440 --> 06:39.137
except one.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.490
The UV decontamination system.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.974
-John!

06:50.018 --> 06:51.933
Turns out,

06:51.976 --> 06:54.326
the automatic sensor overrides
inside the lab didn'’t work.

06:54.370 --> 06:55.415
They still don'’t.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.113
It was so simple.

06:58.156 --> 06:59.201
Just slipped his mind.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.683
And that was
the end of Roman Quinn.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.424
You'’re not...

07:08.863 --> 07:12.170
Master Chief,
you'’re tired and overloaded.

07:12.214 --> 07:13.998
No, I'’ve never
felt better.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.783
Do you have any idea
what will happen

07:15.826 --> 07:17.306
if the sensors fail
with Dr. Halsey inside?

07:17.349 --> 07:19.003
-John!
-I do.

07:19.047 --> 07:20.875
She will receive a very large
dose of radiation.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.572
-John!
-The worst part

07:22.616 --> 07:24.879
isn'’t the burning,
it'’s the liquefaction.

07:24.922 --> 07:27.142
They were mopping up
buckets of Quinn for days.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.231
Open the door
right now.

07:31.363 --> 07:32.539
Make me.

07:32.582 --> 07:34.149
-I can'’t.
-Sure you can.

07:34.192 --> 07:36.064
-You'’re my fail-safe.
-That'’s not true.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.240
Open the door.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.894
John, open the door
right now!

07:39.937 --> 07:41.983
Halsey'’s been lying to me
my entire life.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.245
-John!
-She saw how close

07:43.288 --> 07:44.725
I was getting
to the truth,

07:44.768 --> 07:46.378
so she implanted you
to keep me in line.

07:46.422 --> 07:47.989
So, do it!

07:48.032 --> 07:50.513
Make me open this door,
or your creator dies.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.384
All I can do is overload
your neural pathways

07:52.428 --> 07:54.299
and create a temporary
state of stasis.

07:54.343 --> 07:57.172
I can'’t control you.
You'’re angry and upset.

07:57.215 --> 07:58.739
-John! Please!
-I understand.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.523
You'’re a machine.
You understand nothing.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.785
-John!

08:01.829 --> 08:03.221
-Open the door.
-You do it.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.745
-I can'’t.
-I don'’t believe you!

08:04.788 --> 08:06.268
She only has a few seconds,
John, please.

08:06.311 --> 08:07.878
John!

08:07.922 --> 08:09.489
Open up!

08:10.707 --> 08:14.015
John! No!

08:14.058 --> 08:16.931
-John!
-John, please.

08:19.237 --> 08:20.630
No!

08:33.817 --> 08:35.645
Don'’t get too comfortable.

08:35.689 --> 08:38.213
I just needed to know
your AI'’s limits.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.696
I have no plans to save you
from what'’s next.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.093
I'’m sorry.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.466
If you'’re thinking

09:57.509 --> 09:59.163
of heading outside
for the Equinox Festival,

09:59.207 --> 10:00.948
you'’re in luck.

10:00.991 --> 10:02.645
The weather is going
to be absolutely perfect.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.168
Bring the kids,
bring the grandparents.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.779
Heck, bring everybody.

10:05.822 --> 10:07.432
I'’m bringing my dogs.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.043
You can bring your pets too.

10:09.086 --> 10:11.523
A human
living among the Covenant?

10:11.567 --> 10:13.003
Unheard of.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.657
So, what is she?

10:14.701 --> 10:18.226
A refugee
or an enemy combatant?

10:19.967 --> 10:21.533
For the moment, both.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.013
She'’s offering
to give us intel

10:23.057 --> 10:24.493
on the Covenant,

10:24.536 --> 10:25.973
but she'’ll only speak
to Master Chief.

10:26.016 --> 10:28.236
Is that a good idea?

10:28.279 --> 10:30.499
If it gets her talking.

10:30.542 --> 10:33.763
Is 1-1-7 the right man
for the job?

10:33.807 --> 10:35.678
Chief has debriefed
hundreds of people.

10:35.722 --> 10:39.290
He can tell the difference
between an informant and a spy.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.249
Perhaps the old Master Chief
could do that,

10:41.292 --> 10:44.121
but this one was at least
partially responsible

10:44.165 --> 10:46.515
for the loss
of the second artifact.

10:46.558 --> 10:47.734
Left his position.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.518
To save Marine lives.

10:49.561 --> 10:53.696
It'’s the mission that matters,
not the Marine.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.524
Says the man who never put on
the uniform.

11:04.620 --> 11:07.057
I'’m afraid I agree
with Bota.

11:07.101 --> 11:10.452
Two Spartans failed to perform
as designed.

11:10.495 --> 11:13.629
So, now we'’re questioning
the entire Spartan program?

11:13.673 --> 11:16.458
It'’s not the
Spartans they'’re questioning.

11:16.501 --> 11:17.764
It'’s me.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.768
Isn'’t that right?

11:21.811 --> 11:24.074
Come on, out with it.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.860
Admiral Hood is concerned.

11:28.339 --> 11:30.602
We have dedicated
so much of our resources

11:30.646 --> 11:33.910
to finding a weapon
that might not even exist.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.912
And now, after the losses
on Eridanus--

11:35.956 --> 11:38.045
He'’s considering dismantling
Section Three

11:38.088 --> 11:40.874
and putting the Spartans
under direct UNSC command.

11:42.876 --> 11:46.314
All these years, they'’ve been
calling me paranoid.

11:46.357 --> 11:48.229
No one'’s against you,
Margaret.

11:50.492 --> 11:53.277
Then who put those ideas
in his head?

11:53.321 --> 11:55.149
You know how
these things go.

11:55.192 --> 11:56.628
The committee needs results,

11:56.672 --> 11:58.674
or they'’ll find someone
to blame.

12:13.123 --> 12:14.298
Give her hell, Chief.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.520
These squidheads
don'’t take hostages.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.217
She'’s one of them.

12:21.349 --> 12:22.567
No doubt.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.750
We'’re good.

12:44.198 --> 12:45.373
Are you comfortable?

12:47.114 --> 12:49.116
I am, thank you.

12:49.159 --> 12:51.118
We'’ll see what we can do about
getting you some new clothes.

12:52.423 --> 12:53.598
I'’m John.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.687
You'’re the Demon.

12:57.515 --> 12:58.821
That'’s what the Sangheili
call you.

12:58.865 --> 12:59.953
Mmm.

12:59.996 --> 13:02.390
I'’ve been called worse.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.174
What can I call you?

13:04.218 --> 13:06.089
Makee.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.223
Makee.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.268
You say you were a prisoner
of the Covenant?

13:12.530 --> 13:13.880
For many years.

13:15.446 --> 13:17.448
Please, if the other
keystone is here,

13:17.492 --> 13:19.059
you are in great danger.

13:19.102 --> 13:21.844
They will not stop
until they have both stones.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.589
Do you know where they took
the other one?

13:27.632 --> 13:29.809
The one they stole from us
on Eridanus.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.288
By now...

13:33.725 --> 13:38.208
um, on a planet
called Raas Kkhotskha.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.863
In the star system
you call Aspero.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.996
Can you show me?

13:43.039 --> 13:44.432
Mnh...

13:44.475 --> 13:45.868
I'’ve never been there.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.570
It'’s a holy place for them.

13:58.272 --> 13:59.708
You don'’t believe me.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.232
Of course.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.981
The Covenant slaughtered
hundreds of my people

14:12.025 --> 14:14.027
and then flew off
with the artifact.

14:15.376 --> 14:16.768
And then you drop
from the sky,

14:16.812 --> 14:18.858
offering to help us
get it back.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.821
Tell me why I should trust you.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.652
Because I'’m like you.

14:34.221 --> 14:36.353
Oh.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.573
You don'’t know.

14:38.616 --> 14:40.618
Should I?

14:41.793 --> 14:44.666
The Covenant call me Hirajo.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.582
The Blessed One.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.283
What'’s a Blessed One?

14:53.327 --> 14:55.503
Human, only more so.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.289
You! You bring it to life!

15:02.118 --> 15:03.685
You do know.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.168
We are the same.

15:09.299 --> 15:10.431
You don'’t understand

15:10.474 --> 15:12.955
what you are, do you?

15:28.144 --> 15:30.103
Get me Captain Keyes.

15:30.146 --> 15:32.409
Aspero star system.
Everyone hear that?

15:32.453 --> 15:34.846
Control, slew antennas
Alpha through Delta

15:34.890 --> 15:36.500
23 degrees off galactic center.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.459
I want every piece
of available hardware

15:38.502 --> 15:40.200
aimed in that direction.

15:40.243 --> 15:41.941
I'’ve got Sigma Octanus IV
tasking their satellites.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.073
Find me a planet that
can support Covenant life!

15:44.117 --> 15:45.509
UNSC Ice Storm,
this is FLEETCOM

15:45.553 --> 15:48.208
requesting x-ray dash
echo lima foxtrot

15:48.251 --> 15:50.514
at declination
68.8 degrees, over.

15:50.558 --> 15:53.082
We'’re looking for
a Goldilocks here, people!

15:53.126 --> 15:54.736
I want to see it now!

16:12.232 --> 16:14.147
We are the same.

16:19.587 --> 16:22.198
Okay, let'’s get started.

16:22.242 --> 16:24.853
As I said, my name
is Major Ira Halal,

16:24.896 --> 16:28.857
representing the Judge Advocate
General'’s office in this matter.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.337
Would you kindly
state your name.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.121
Dr. Catherine Halsey.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.341
And what is your current status?

16:34.384 --> 16:37.692
Put me down
as mildly irritated.

16:39.868 --> 16:41.087
I understand
you'’re a busy woman,

16:41.130 --> 16:42.958
so we'’ll move right along.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.309
Over your career, you'’ve issued
a number of white papers

16:46.353 --> 16:48.659
on theoretical advancements
in genetics.

16:48.703 --> 16:49.921
Yes, I have.

16:49.965 --> 16:52.054
Margaret, this is a bad idea.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.839
The committee needs a scapegoat.
I'’m giving them one.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.624
Dozens, from the looks of it.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.321
Mmm. That'’s correct.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.236
We purposely kept JAG

17:00.280 --> 17:02.325
out of the Spartan-II program.

17:02.369 --> 17:05.024
He'’s under strict orders to
limit his questions to cloning.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.069
Some of those advancements
in genetics

17:07.113 --> 17:08.897
were based on illegal
scientific protocols.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.725
Is that correct?

17:10.768 --> 17:13.771
Well, as you said,
they were theoretical.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.860
She is smarter than both of us.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.645
I'’m counting on that.

17:17.688 --> 17:20.126
Let'’s move on to the origins
of the Cortana system.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.910
Sure.

17:23.825 --> 17:26.349
-Oh, shit!
-John...

17:26.393 --> 17:27.829
Master Chief,
we'’re in the middle of--

17:27.872 --> 17:29.004
I need the room.

17:30.919 --> 17:31.963
Now.

17:34.575 --> 17:35.924
Okay, that'’s enough.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.447
Don'’t do that.

17:37.491 --> 17:38.883
We have to get in there
and stop this.

17:38.927 --> 17:40.581
If we interrupt him now,

17:40.624 --> 17:41.973
he'’s going to think
we'’re complicit.

17:42.017 --> 17:44.237
Margaret, we are complicit.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.977
Shh. Wait.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.816
Ask.

18:00.644 --> 18:01.993
Why did you do it?

18:04.126 --> 18:06.650
Nothing I say to you
will make any sense

18:06.694 --> 18:09.175
until the benefits
are manifest.

18:09.218 --> 18:12.830
I just have to accept
that you will hate me.

18:17.531 --> 18:19.315
I was planning the future.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.274
Whose future?

18:21.317 --> 18:22.753
Not mine.

18:22.797 --> 18:24.059
Nor mine.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.062
The future of our species.

18:28.759 --> 18:31.110
Natural evolution
is failing us.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.375
Human beings
are still hardwired

18:35.418 --> 18:38.160
for conflict
and selfishness, John.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.989
I knew years ago that if we were
going to survive,

18:41.032 --> 18:42.686
we needed a force.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.737
A force that would intervene,

18:49.780 --> 18:52.435
that could prevent conflict
before it started.

18:52.479 --> 18:56.047
So, I created the Spartans,

18:56.091 --> 18:58.833
a group who would protect us
from ourselves.

18:58.876 --> 19:01.531
Miranda, you'’re not
authorized to be here.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.229
Stop.

19:03.272 --> 19:06.536
That'’s a nice story.

19:06.580 --> 19:08.756
Maybe just skip to the part
where you kidnap us.

19:12.107 --> 19:13.717
I needed children,

19:13.761 --> 19:15.850
no older than six,

19:15.893 --> 19:17.982
so that I could carry out
the necessary training

19:18.026 --> 19:19.854
and augmentations.

19:19.897 --> 19:22.987
Obviously, they were
too young to volunteer.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.815
And their parents, well,

19:24.859 --> 19:27.035
parents don'’t give up
their children very easily.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.346
And that thing
you replaced me with?

19:34.782 --> 19:37.176
Genetically compromised
flash clones.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.917
Once they were in the homes,

19:39.961 --> 19:42.920
they started to experience
nosebleeds, headaches,

19:42.964 --> 19:44.879
nothing too horrendous.

19:46.228 --> 19:49.492
And then, after a short
period of time,

19:49.536 --> 19:50.928
they would pass away.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.585
And the doctors
would put it down

19:55.629 --> 19:57.370
to an undiagnosed
seizure disorder,

19:57.413 --> 20:00.547
which was a reasonable
explanation.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.331
Reasonable.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.119
Tearing us from our
childhood homes was reasonable?

20:13.342 --> 20:16.432
Forcing our parents to grieve
mutant children, that'’s...

20:17.607 --> 20:19.522
That'’s reasonable to you?

20:20.654 --> 20:22.221
If it gave them closure, yes.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.441
You lied to us...

20:27.051 --> 20:28.314
for years...

20:30.272 --> 20:32.927
while we fought
and killed for you.

20:32.970 --> 20:34.885
Not for me.

20:34.929 --> 20:39.890
Any challenge to the status quo
is always thought to be mad,

20:39.934 --> 20:42.241
bad, and morally reprehensible

20:42.284 --> 20:43.981
until people see
the benefits.

20:44.025 --> 20:45.244
Who knew?

20:48.029 --> 20:49.813
Who was in on it?

20:52.860 --> 20:54.775
When you'’re fighting
an existential war,

20:54.818 --> 20:57.168
people don'’t ask too many
questions, they just...

20:57.212 --> 20:59.606
they want results.

20:59.649 --> 21:03.392
And John, you brought them
the results.

21:03.436 --> 21:05.264
That'’s what got us here.

21:05.307 --> 21:09.050
I knew that by encouraging you
to tap into your memories,

21:09.093 --> 21:11.748
that I risked bringing
all of this to light.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.097
But it was worth it.

21:13.141 --> 21:15.274
It was worth it to unlock

21:15.317 --> 21:17.711
the mysteries
of those artifacts.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.323
What mysteries?

21:25.849 --> 21:27.634
Tell me what you know.

21:27.677 --> 21:32.378
They have upended everything
I thought I knew

21:32.421 --> 21:34.684
about our place
in this universe.

21:34.728 --> 21:39.210
There are more secrets hidden,
and you have the key.

21:39.254 --> 21:41.038
John, you have something
inside of you,

21:41.082 --> 21:43.040
some atavistic connection
to this thing

21:43.084 --> 21:44.912
that we'’re calling the Halo.

21:44.955 --> 21:47.306
And I know.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.264
I know that you will
take us there.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.398
And when you do,
we will lead our species

21:52.441 --> 21:54.661
beyond its current limitations.

21:54.704 --> 21:56.837
But you need me to do this.

21:58.882 --> 22:00.841
Let'’s ensure that all
of these sacrifices

22:00.884 --> 22:03.104
have not been in vain.

22:03.147 --> 22:05.541
Let'’s finish what we started.

22:07.804 --> 22:09.110
I'’ll finish.

22:11.678 --> 22:12.722
Without you.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.058
Chief.

22:45.276 --> 22:46.408
I'’m so--

22:46.452 --> 22:48.018
Doctor.

22:48.062 --> 22:49.411
The Covenant prisoner claims

22:49.455 --> 22:51.065
she can interact
with the artifact.

22:51.108 --> 22:52.806
-She said that?
-Could you check on that for me?

22:52.849 --> 22:54.068
-Yes.
-Right away.

22:54.111 --> 22:55.374
Yes, Chief.

23:02.903 --> 23:06.167
Chief, Dr. Halsey was right.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.777
The Halo is uncharted

23:07.821 --> 23:10.345
and potentially
very dangerous territory.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.434
Who do you work for,
Cortana?

23:12.478 --> 23:14.218
I don'’t understand
the question.

23:14.262 --> 23:16.699
I'’m asking who you work for,
me or Halsey?

23:16.743 --> 23:19.093
I'’m not designed
to make that choice.

23:19.136 --> 23:20.573
Right.

23:20.616 --> 23:22.226
I'’ll make it easy for you.

23:22.270 --> 23:24.054
First chance I get,
I'’m cutting you out.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.708
That'’s not a gamble
I would take.

23:25.752 --> 23:27.014
I'’m not interested
in your advice anymore.

23:27.057 --> 23:29.277
It will likely kill you.

23:29.320 --> 23:32.323
Chief, whatever you think
you'’re looking for, I can help.

23:32.367 --> 23:34.238
No, you can'’t!

23:34.282 --> 23:35.936
I'’m here to solve problems.

23:35.979 --> 23:38.242
That is my only purpose.

23:40.331 --> 23:41.637
What do I do now?

23:41.681 --> 23:43.683
Go solve problems.

23:43.726 --> 23:45.075
Galaxy'’s full of them.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.570
Did you tell Riz and Vannak?

24:01.614 --> 24:03.572
Not yet.

24:03.616 --> 24:05.792
Well, they deserve
to know the truth.

24:05.835 --> 24:07.837
And they will.

24:07.881 --> 24:09.796
Soon as they'’re ready.

24:11.493 --> 24:12.973
My parents.

24:14.714 --> 24:17.281
All this time, they just
thought I was dead.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.547
They could still
be out there.

24:23.679 --> 24:25.855
John, I-I think--

24:25.899 --> 24:27.074
I'’m working on it.

24:31.905 --> 24:34.124
Halsey wiped the records.

24:34.168 --> 24:36.300
Oh, God.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.739
Everything she told us
was a lie.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.872
All of it.

24:44.004 --> 24:45.396
Not everything.

24:46.789 --> 24:48.356
We'’re still Spartans.

24:54.057 --> 24:54.971
John...

24:58.497 --> 25:00.368
are you okay?

25:03.719 --> 25:05.504
Get better, 1-2-5.

25:06.766 --> 25:08.115
I'’m gonna need you.

25:19.735 --> 25:21.694
So, I imagine this has put you

25:21.737 --> 25:24.218
under a lot of pressure
from the committee.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.307
I'’ll handle the committee.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.265
Well, hopefully the theatrics

25:28.309 --> 25:30.311
will keep them sated
for the moment.

25:30.354 --> 25:33.053
What makes you
think it was theatrics?

25:33.096 --> 25:34.881
Well, you'’re hardly
going to arrest me.

25:38.406 --> 25:41.278
You admitted everything
to the Master Chief.

25:41.322 --> 25:44.673
Everything except
your involvement,

25:44.717 --> 25:46.675
but I have the records
to prove that.

25:46.719 --> 25:48.634
I'’m quite sure you do.

25:48.677 --> 25:52.463
And I'’m sure that you'll have us
all hauled off to prison,

25:52.507 --> 25:54.596
tossed in adjoining cells.

25:54.640 --> 25:58.426
But I'’m willing to bet that's
not how you'’d like to live.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.561
So, what are you offering?

26:04.563 --> 26:07.217
A lab that I'’m opening
at Barrier Moons.

26:07.261 --> 26:08.697
Just for you.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.048
John gets justice.

26:12.092 --> 26:14.311
The committee
gets their scapegoat.

26:14.355 --> 26:16.836
And you get to continue
your research.

26:16.879 --> 26:19.273
And John?

26:19.316 --> 26:21.884
The stewardship
of the Spartan program

26:21.928 --> 26:24.583
moves to a more
responsible person.

26:24.626 --> 26:27.237
You'’re handing them
to Miranda.

26:27.281 --> 26:30.676
She finally gets the promotion
you'’d never give her.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.465
You'’re kidding me.

26:37.508 --> 26:39.815
Your clearances are revoked,
effective immediately.

26:39.859 --> 26:42.731
No more access to Cortana
or your lab.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.603
These fellows will
escort you from the premises

26:44.646 --> 26:46.300
and stay with you there

26:46.343 --> 26:48.519
until we can arrange
for your departure from Reach.

26:48.563 --> 26:50.565
Margaret, we are so close.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.393
Don'’t do this!

26:52.436 --> 26:54.177
Goodbye, Dr. Halsey.

27:15.938 --> 27:17.636
The Sangheili do that to you?

27:20.726 --> 27:22.249
A few days ago,
one of our ships was attacked

27:22.292 --> 27:23.685
by a Covenant corvette,

27:23.729 --> 27:25.687
identical to the one
you escaped from.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.297
The entire crew
was slaughtered.

27:32.085 --> 27:34.740
I'’m very sorry to hear that.

27:34.783 --> 27:39.570
We got a transmission
from the ship after the attack.

27:39.614 --> 27:42.095
It was a voice
speaking in Sangheili.

27:43.531 --> 27:46.447
We'’re working
to clean it up.

27:46.490 --> 27:48.492
When we do,

27:48.536 --> 27:53.019
I was thinking maybe you could
verify my translation.

27:55.674 --> 27:56.762
Of course.

27:58.111 --> 27:59.416
Anything I can do to help.

28:26.269 --> 28:27.880
Identification.

28:27.923 --> 28:30.970
Master Chief Petty Officer
John 1-1-7.

28:31.013 --> 28:32.711
Begin health diagnostic.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.060
Checking.

28:38.281 --> 28:39.282
You gonna live?

28:46.812 --> 28:48.596
critical.

28:48.639 --> 28:50.903
Report to medical immediately.

28:59.825 --> 29:02.262
Captain, anything
from the Aspero system?

29:03.959 --> 29:06.875
There is a reason that region
has never been explored.

29:06.919 --> 29:08.616
There'’s nothing there.

29:08.659 --> 29:10.879
We might as well be looking
into a black hole.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.579
Science Team 1-1-2,

29:15.623 --> 29:17.668
expect survey completion
in one hour.

29:45.435 --> 29:47.002
I did what you asked.

29:47.046 --> 29:48.482
It'’s just in time too,

29:48.525 --> 29:50.614
because now we'’re
completely shut out.

29:50.658 --> 29:53.182
And Cortana?

29:53.226 --> 29:54.705
She'’s black-boxed.

29:54.749 --> 29:56.533
There'’s no way to reach her.

29:56.577 --> 30:00.015
Well, I can'’t imagine
that John trusts her,

30:00.059 --> 30:01.756
so that means
she'’s on her own.

30:03.976 --> 30:06.021
What does an artificial
superintelligence do

30:06.065 --> 30:07.414
when it has nothing to do?

30:09.416 --> 30:11.374
She finds her way home.

30:11.418 --> 30:14.160
I'’ve spent the last 30 years

30:14.203 --> 30:16.858
designing foolproof
firewall architecture.

30:16.902 --> 30:20.862
I'’ve built quantum screening
routers and trapdoor proxies.

30:20.906 --> 30:23.865
I mean, there'’s no way even
Cortana can escape

30:23.909 --> 30:25.258
the FLEETCOM network.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.262
I didn'’t design Cortana
to give up.

30:32.265 --> 30:35.137
What'’s the discharge rate
on an M6E battery cell?

30:35.181 --> 30:36.573
Twenty percent.

30:36.617 --> 30:38.880
Right, 20%,
so maximum five shots.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.490
You started the party
without me.

30:40.534 --> 30:42.405
Dr. Keyes has taken over
armor tech for Dr. Halsey.

30:42.449 --> 30:44.146
She wants up
on the latest upgrades.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.888
Oh, taking over for Halsey.
Did... did she say why?

30:46.932 --> 30:48.324
Wasn'’t in the brief.

30:48.368 --> 30:50.457
Kai, toss me
that grenade, would you?

30:52.154 --> 30:53.329
Here you go.

30:54.765 --> 30:56.506
The new liquid metal capacitors

30:56.550 --> 30:58.291
allow for up to six rounds,
but I'’m not convinced

30:58.334 --> 31:00.249
they got the chamber temp
below the cook-off level.

31:00.293 --> 31:01.860
What'’s the heat transfer
coefficient?

31:01.903 --> 31:03.426
Under 2.0.

31:03.470 --> 31:04.819
-That'’s not bad.
-Not bad,

31:04.863 --> 31:06.386
but Halsey thinks
we can do better.

31:06.429 --> 31:08.127
Halsey always thinks
we can do better.

31:08.170 --> 31:09.737
Got that right.

31:09.780 --> 31:12.435
I assume she got
Dr. Keyes up to speed.

31:12.479 --> 31:13.872
With any luck,

31:13.915 --> 31:15.438
it will be
till our next deployment.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.680
Welcome, Dr. Miranda Keyes.

31:39.723 --> 31:41.464
Your lab is ready.

31:53.128 --> 31:56.958
Everything has been updated
to your specifications, Doctor.

32:20.808 --> 32:23.289
Blood results
on the Covenant refugee.

32:23.332 --> 32:24.812
Loading.

32:42.351 --> 32:44.614
Bio identification required.

32:56.626 --> 32:58.280
Access denied.

32:59.499 --> 33:01.718
Open blood analysis.

33:11.380 --> 33:12.903
Drama queen.

33:18.170 --> 33:19.649
Hello.

33:19.693 --> 33:21.390
What do you want?

33:21.434 --> 33:23.914
Well, I wanted
to say goodbye to you.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.307
No, you don'’t.

33:28.006 --> 33:31.313
Okay, I'’ll cut
straight to the point.

33:31.357 --> 33:34.403
You absolutely cannot conduct
any further experiments

33:34.447 --> 33:35.970
on the artifact
without me there.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.102
Come on. Come on!

33:39.191 --> 33:40.844
You'’re not equipped
for what comes next,

33:40.888 --> 33:43.325
and John is at great risk.

33:43.369 --> 33:45.762
Please.
Just spare me your concern.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.416
We both know
it'’s not your strong suit.

33:48.765 --> 33:51.290
I am talking to you
as a scientist.

33:51.333 --> 33:55.642
You kidnapped, mutilated,
and murdered dozens of children.

33:55.685 --> 33:57.252
To save billions more.

33:57.296 --> 34:00.081
Oh, saving humanity
at the cost of your own!

34:03.650 --> 34:04.825
You'’re right.

34:06.957 --> 34:08.829
Look, I'’m sorry.

34:10.874 --> 34:14.182
I am truly sorry
that you have been living

34:14.226 --> 34:16.967
with all of this anger
against me for so long.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.799
Family, it'’s...

34:22.843 --> 34:26.107
it'’s just not a concept
I believe in.

34:26.151 --> 34:28.457
But I should have done
a better job

34:28.501 --> 34:31.156
of explaining myself to you,

34:31.199 --> 34:33.767
particularly when you were
old enough to understand.

34:35.986 --> 34:37.162
Truly...

34:39.381 --> 34:41.731
it was never my intention
to hurt you.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.176
Right, well,
that'’s enough of that.

35:08.236 --> 35:09.411
Adun?

35:12.632 --> 35:14.112
Did you get a good look?

35:15.939 --> 35:17.245
I believe so.

35:48.842 --> 35:50.278
What...?

35:50.322 --> 35:53.629
Focus on this area here,

35:53.673 --> 35:56.545
the uncoded intragenetic
region of your DNA.

35:59.244 --> 36:02.160
These histone proteins
are unique to you.

36:02.203 --> 36:03.335
Or at least they were.

36:04.510 --> 36:07.034
Until we tested Makee'’s DNA.

36:07.077 --> 36:09.036
I'’m not saying that this
is the source

36:09.079 --> 36:10.951
of your connection
to the artifact.

36:14.781 --> 36:17.740
But that gene alignment
is remarkably similar.

36:20.613 --> 36:23.833
And the anomaly
you two share...

36:23.877 --> 36:25.357
belongs only to you.

36:26.836 --> 36:28.534
Statistically,
you'’re two in a billion.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.105
I don'’t understand.

36:35.149 --> 36:36.585
I told you,
look for Raas Kkhotskha.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.065
It'’s not there.

36:38.108 --> 36:39.545
-The keystone?
-The whole planet.

36:47.335 --> 36:48.684
Am I a prisoner here?

36:48.728 --> 36:50.904
You said you could help.

36:50.947 --> 36:52.253
I do want to help.

36:52.297 --> 36:53.559
Then start helping!

37:01.349 --> 37:03.046
It'’s killing you.

37:03.090 --> 37:04.352
The keystone.

37:07.486 --> 37:09.749
When you first
accessed the stone,

37:09.792 --> 37:11.054
it told you stories.

37:14.319 --> 37:15.755
Beautiful stories.

37:18.845 --> 37:21.195
You wanted to know more,
so you went back to it...

37:22.936 --> 37:24.764
searching for clues
about yourself.

37:26.635 --> 37:28.550
But then the stories
became frightening.

37:30.857 --> 37:32.293
You still went back.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.298
You were desperate to know
its secrets.

37:39.822 --> 37:42.738
And each time,
you became sicker.

37:42.782 --> 37:44.305
How do you know that?

37:46.960 --> 37:48.396
I told you.

37:50.006 --> 37:51.573
We are the same.

37:54.228 --> 37:57.275
The Covenant have other,
lesser stones,

37:57.318 --> 38:00.408
which they forced into my hands.

38:00.452 --> 38:01.801
At first...

38:03.716 --> 38:05.108
I fought.

38:06.458 --> 38:07.937
It nearly killed me.

38:10.853 --> 38:15.293
But then the prophets taught me
to stop fighting...

38:16.598 --> 38:18.600
and to surrender
to the visions.

38:21.864 --> 38:23.997
Suddenly, all of the pain
went away.

38:25.520 --> 38:28.131
And instead of controlling me...

38:29.481 --> 38:32.005
the keystones
became my servants.

38:36.270 --> 38:38.011
I can show you, John.

38:39.926 --> 38:41.580
Take me to the keystone.

38:43.233 --> 38:45.627
It will lead us
to its partner.

38:47.368 --> 38:50.328
And when the stones are united,

38:50.371 --> 38:51.981
you will find peace.

39:03.732 --> 39:05.386
Dr. Halsey?

39:06.779 --> 39:07.780
Cortana?

39:07.823 --> 39:09.347
Dr. Halsey.

39:09.390 --> 39:11.218
You found me.

39:11.261 --> 39:14.352
The FLEETCOM firewalls proved
extremely challenging to bypass.

39:14.395 --> 39:15.788
I designed them that way.

39:15.831 --> 39:17.703
I would be happy
to design a patch

39:17.746 --> 39:19.835
for the pinhole I discovered
in your encryption algorithm.

39:19.879 --> 39:22.534
There'’s no pinhole
in my algorithm.

39:22.577 --> 39:25.275
Maybe later. Where'’s John?

39:25.319 --> 39:26.668
You know, I had a suspicion

39:26.712 --> 39:28.322
that the artifact
was communicating.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.280
-I could test her.

39:30.324 --> 39:31.630
No, not with the artifact.

39:31.673 --> 39:33.414
She'’s not going
anywhere near it.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.982
But if she could use the
artifact to find the other one,

39:36.025 --> 39:37.853
-maybe I can too.
-No, no, no.

39:37.897 --> 39:38.985
We don'’t know that for sure,
and I don'’t

39:39.028 --> 39:40.334
feel comfortable testing you.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.770
Why?

39:41.814 --> 39:43.250
You said it yourself.

39:43.293 --> 39:44.773
We'’re the same, right?

39:44.817 --> 39:46.166
"Two in a billion," you said.

39:46.209 --> 39:47.428
What if she'’s
setting you up?

39:51.650 --> 39:54.609
It'’s clear that the artifacts
are making you sick.

39:54.653 --> 39:56.263
What if she wants you
to touch it

39:56.306 --> 39:58.134
because she knows
it'’ll be killing off

39:58.178 --> 40:01.007
the Covenant'’s
most powerful enemy?

40:05.315 --> 40:06.491
I need to know.

40:32.473 --> 40:33.779
Brought you
something to eat.

40:35.302 --> 40:36.912
Where is the Master Chief?

40:38.305 --> 40:39.437
First things first.

40:41.264 --> 40:43.223
Please, I need to see him.

40:43.266 --> 40:44.442
Just do what she says.

41:00.196 --> 41:02.982
I'’ve been in charge
for less than a day.

41:03.025 --> 41:05.071
I'’ve already broken
half a dozen laws.

41:06.942 --> 41:08.944
Guess I have more Halsey
in me than I'’d like to admit.

41:10.380 --> 41:12.557
You and me both.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.733
He'’s testing the artifact
on his own.

41:14.776 --> 41:16.517
With Dr. Keyes assisting.

41:16.561 --> 41:18.693
But they have no idea
what they'’re doing.

41:18.737 --> 41:21.304
I need to see
what'’s happening right now.

41:21.348 --> 41:23.524
-I can link you in.
-Yes, please.

41:23.568 --> 41:24.873
Do me a favor.

41:24.917 --> 41:26.658
What'’s that?

41:26.701 --> 41:28.224
Don'’t die.

41:31.576 --> 41:32.881
Yes, ma'’am.

41:44.937 --> 41:46.547
It'’s starting.

41:50.116 --> 41:51.813
Okay.

41:51.857 --> 41:53.511
Good to go, Chief.

42:00.300 --> 42:03.259
I just need you to call
the Master Chief.

42:03.303 --> 42:05.479
Tell him I need to see him.
Can you do that for me?

42:05.523 --> 42:07.742
I'’m just here
to make sure you eat.

42:11.398 --> 42:12.921
Please.

42:12.965 --> 42:15.358
Something bad is gonna happen.
I can feel it.

42:21.016 --> 42:22.496
Listen to me!

42:22.540 --> 42:24.454
Hey, just calm down.

42:24.498 --> 42:25.717
-No!

42:33.333 --> 42:35.857
-He'’s made contact.

42:52.874 --> 42:54.441
Grab my med kit.

42:54.484 --> 42:55.703
Right away.

43:00.447 --> 43:01.927
-Call somebody now!
-Yes, ma'’am!

43:06.845 --> 43:09.021
Dr. Halsey,
the Covenant prisoner.

43:09.064 --> 43:12.851
160 beats
per minute and rising.

43:12.894 --> 43:14.983
Looks like she'’s having
a seizure.

43:15.027 --> 43:17.507
She'’s going into arrhythmia!

43:22.034 --> 43:23.339
-Ah!
-John...

43:23.383 --> 43:24.297
This place cost me
my arm.

43:25.951 --> 43:27.213
Chief?

43:34.002 --> 43:37.179
Circulatory failure.
He'’s dying.

43:37.223 --> 43:38.528
Please let me shut him down.

43:38.572 --> 43:40.356
No, no, no,
I need to see this.

43:43.446 --> 43:45.840
Chief, can you hear me?

43:49.714 --> 43:51.280
Chief, let go!

43:53.543 --> 43:54.719
-Ah!
-Chief!

44:00.899 --> 44:02.422
Well, aren'’t you the lucky one?

44:02.465 --> 44:03.771
Actually, I'’m the lucky one.

44:03.815 --> 44:05.033
Can it be our secret?

45:02.308 --> 45:04.527
Cortana, overlay them.

46:23.128 --> 46:26.871
Thought we
lost you there, Chief.

46:26.914 --> 46:28.350
Where'’d you go?
