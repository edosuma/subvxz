00:18.190 --> 00:20.399
Don't you recognize a
rocket when you see one

00:20.400 --> 00:22.139
I- I was merely
demonstrating a physics law

00:22.140 --> 00:25.069

A magician doesn't reveal his secrets

00:32.910 --> 00:34.459
But I thought you said it was physics

00:34.460 --> 00:35.860
Physics...magic

00:35.880 --> 00:36.640
Trust me

00:36.660 --> 00:40.095
It will not do you any
good to argue with him

Really starting to get

01:41.200 --> 01:42.379
You're

01:42.380 --> 01:46.439
You know if sarah doesn't put it
on the list she doesn't need it

01:46.440 --> 01:49.300
- She doesn't make mistakes

01:49.810 --> 01:51.500

02:08.759 --> 02:11.659
You better step off before I make
you wish you never walked up on me

02:11.660 --> 02:16.249
What,you think you a bad-ass now because
they pay you to wear that gun,mr Fbi

02:16.250 --> 02:19.889
Rodney,I proved a long time ago
I don't need a gun to take you out

02:19.890 --> 02:24.861
Past history,that's a dangerous
thing for you to count on,my friend

02:25.110 --> 02:26.850
Walk away

02:42.390 --> 02:43.480
Bitch

02:51.740 --> 02:53.160
You all right

02:54.390 --> 02:55.730
Just a fool

02:56.370 --> 02:58.199
come on,I'm taking you home

02:58.200 --> 03:00.580
There's something I gotta do

03:11.620 --> 03:12.999
That's the man,james

03:13.000 --> 03:14.139
Way to run a route

Nice job,nice job

Come on,damien

03:17.540 --> 03:19.099
You call that pass coverage

route every damned time

03:21.880 --> 03:24.250
Ok,let's bring it in,boys

03:24.490 --> 03:26.440
Get your helmets,let's go

03:34.940 --> 03:36.709
You pushed

03:36.710 --> 03:38.299
Man,you weren't close
enough to push off of

03:38.300 --> 03:39.219
I blew you away

03:39.220 --> 03:40.969
I could cover your ass all day long

03:40.970 --> 03:42.960
- Man,kiss it all day long

03:44.720 --> 03:45.620
Hey,hey,hey

Knock it off

03:48.680 --> 03:49.810
That's enough

03:50.920 --> 03:54.069
You did push off,james,on your
second cut,with your inside hand

03:54.070 --> 03:54.950
Damn right

03:54.970 --> 03:56.240
Hey

03:56.260 --> 03:57.839

It's a remote starter,mom

05:56.800 --> 06:00.999
You hit that button right there and it
starts your car from inside the house

06:01.000 --> 06:02.840
Why would I do that

06:02.860 --> 06:05.329
So it's nice and warm when you get in it

06:05.330 --> 06:06.300

This is some kind of sick joke,right

07:09.210 --> 07:10.759
Don't make us get physical

07:10.760 --> 07:13.780
It'll only make it worse for your family

07:16.530 --> 07:18.830
You're under arrest,derek

07:54.395 --> 07:56.515
how secrets deep

07:56.535 --> 07:58.765
how secrets become dark

07:58.785 --> 08:01.024
that's in the nature of secrets

08:01.025 --> 08:03.265
" Writer,cory doctorow

reason for doing that in front of my family

08:07.065 --> 08:08.794
You gonna tell me the charges now

Uncuff him

And you'll always be a
racist son of a bitch to me

08:19.115 --> 08:20.845
Right,derek

08:20.865 --> 08:22.475
That's all it is

Do you want a lawyer

08:50.545 --> 08:53.124

The fbi invented this

You're following me

Whose grave is that

10:43.745 --> 10:44.714
Why would you be following me

10:44.715 --> 10:46.175
Whose grave

10:47.525 --> 10:48.854
You know I don't know his name

10:48.855 --> 10:50.164
You paid to bury him,didn't you

10:50.165 --> 10:51.234
The neighborhood did

But you led the collection

10:52.775 --> 10:53.515
So

10:53.535 --> 10:54.794
And you visit him a lot

10:54.795 --> 10:55.734
Every time I come home

Ok,that's me at the youth center tossing
a ball around with a couple of kids

11:14.545 --> 11:16.884
You did a little more than that

12:08.095 --> 12:10.774
I have your superintendent's
personal cell number,

12:10.775 --> 12:13.544
and in the interest of not running
roughshod over another police agency

12:13.545 --> 12:16.505
I've resisted calling him so far

12:17.075 --> 12:19.525
I need to see agent morgan now

12:21.135 --> 12:21.954
I'll get gordinski

12:21.955 --> 12:24.455
He's the,uh,primary

12:26.865 --> 12:29.404
I don't like them calling him a suspect

12:29.405 --> 12:30.765
Me neither

12:31.515 --> 12:35.089
You're the last person
anyone saw with my victim

12:38.085 --> 12:39.555
You recognize him

12:39.575 --> 12:41.991
Found in an alley four years ago

12:42.905 --> 12:44.395
Still unidentified

12:44.415 --> 12:46.025
John doe

12:46.045 --> 12:50.064
Just like that kid whose grave you
visit every time you come to chicago

12:50.065 --> 12:51.545
Another boy

12:51.565 --> 12:53.264
Just after you left the city

12:53.265 --> 12:54.254
This is crazy

12:54.255 --> 12:55.355
No kidding

12:55.375 --> 12:57.215
Look,man,rodney harris

12:57.235 --> 12:59.544
He's been following me around
ever since I got back to town

12:59.545 --> 13:00.704
Rodney harris the gangbanger

13:00.705 --> 13:02.954
Yeah,he was waiting for me
outside of a corner store

13:02.955 --> 13:04.114
He did that drive-by yesterday

13:04.115 --> 13:06.304
So you think this looks like
something a gangbanger did

13:06.305 --> 13:08.947
Is that how you'd advise me,mr Fbi

13:10.575 --> 13:12.615
Dennison: Stan

13:14.625 --> 13:17.854
All right,tell him I'll be there in a minute

13:17.855 --> 13:23.267
You're gonna have to come up with
something better than a gangbanger,derek

13:29.615 --> 13:31.735
Detective gordinski,cpb

13:31.755 --> 13:35.264
You think an fbi agent,a bau
profiler committed a homicide

13:35.265 --> 13:38.845
Actually,three homicides
at least,over 15 years

13:38.865 --> 13:40.434
You-you think
he's a serial killer

13:40.435 --> 13:41.644
This is ridiculous

13:41.645 --> 13:42.854
Has he been charged with anything

13:42.855 --> 13:45.045
I got 72 hours for that

13:45.065 --> 13:46.464
I'd like to see him

13:46.465 --> 13:47.365
Be my guest

13:47.385 --> 13:48.405
This way

13:49.945 --> 13:51.234
Agent gideon,right

13:51.235 --> 13:52.155
Yes

13:52.175 --> 13:53.934
I owe you a big thank you

13:53.935 --> 14:00.485
I had no suspects at all until you looked
over my case for me and sent me this profile

14:01.335 --> 14:05.702
Everything in it points to
that son of a bitch,derek morgan

14:17.930 --> 14:19.540
I profiled him

14:19.560 --> 14:21.480
It's all right there

14:21.500 --> 14:23.899
Detective,a profile's just a guide

14:23.900 --> 14:25.419
Yeah,this one guided me to him

14:25.420 --> 14:29.649
They're really more useful in the elimination
of suspects rather than the inclusion

14:29.650 --> 14:31.380
That's not the way
you presented it to me

14:31.415 --> 14:33.850
Well,if I confused you,I'm sorry

14:33.870 --> 14:35.389
I'm not confused at all

14:35.390 --> 14:39.829
Look,whatever it is in here that made you consider
agent morgan a suspect has to be coincidencE

14:39.830 --> 14:41.429
You can't rely solely on this

14:41.430 --> 14:43.090
You're right,I'm not

14:46.030 --> 14:47.780
You ok

14:47.950 --> 14:49.150
This kid

14:50.040 --> 14:51.489
I was with him yesterday

14:51.490 --> 14:52.740
So

14:52.980 --> 14:54.990
So he's dead

14:55.010 --> 15:01.013
I drove him home,hotch,and gordinski's
saying I was the last person seen with him

15:01.050 --> 15:03.189
15 years ago,I was a new detective

15:03.190 --> 15:05.619
One of my first cases was a black kid

15:05.620 --> 15:08.569
12 or 13 years old,found
strangled in a vacant lot near here

15:08.570 --> 15:09.989
Boy was a john doe,right

15:09.990 --> 15:11.769
Still unidentified to this day

15:11.770 --> 15:14.359
Wait,a 12-year-old kid
that no one reported missing

15:14.360 --> 15:15.430
Ever

15:15.450 --> 15:17.819
Four years ago,another
body turns up,same M O

15:17.820 --> 15:20.959
Worked that case just as hard,came
up with just as much nothing

15:20.960 --> 15:22.999
Nobody in the area had
ever seen the kid before

15:23.000 --> 15:24.669
No one's looking for these kids

15:24.670 --> 15:29.069
Then a few months back,I attended a
seminar that you taught at cpd headquarters

15:29.070 --> 15:33.609
I told you about my case,you said to
send you the files and you'd look 'em over

15:33.610 --> 15:36.290
This is the profile you worked up

15:36.310 --> 15:38.589
There are about 3
million people in chicago

15:38.590 --> 15:44.989
Your profile said I was looking for a black
male,25 to 35,with a knowledge of the area

15:44.990 --> 15:50.199
Nonthreatening to children- either knows them
or is normal enough that he doesn't scare them

15:50.200 --> 15:52.580
A probable criminal record

15:53.070 --> 15:55.069
It also said the way the body was placed

15:55.070 --> 15:57.569
gently on a mattress,not
just tossed on the ground,

15:57.570 --> 16:02.859
indicated someone who was probably consumed
with guilt,especially for the first victim

16:02.860 --> 16:04.510
Your exact
words are-

16:04.530 --> 16:09.609
"with a guilt-ridden offender,"the bau postulates
the first victim is the most important "

16:09.610 --> 16:14.599
and the unsub may still visit the place
of the crime or even the victim himself

16:14.600 --> 16:18.309
" Care to guess who visits my
first victim every time he's in town

16:18.310 --> 16:20.890
Can't be just visiting the victim

16:20.910 --> 16:22.369
There has to be more than that

16:22.370 --> 16:23.290
Sure

16:23.310 --> 16:27.809
You said the unsub might try to inject himself
into the investigation to keep tabs on it

16:27.810 --> 16:31.329
Morgan has called our headquarters
many times since he joined the bureau

16:31.330 --> 16:32.709
Always about this case

16:32.710 --> 16:34.439
So,wait,he talked to you about it

16:34.440 --> 16:35.296
Headquarters

16:35.310 --> 16:36.699
He'd never call me

16:36.700 --> 16:39.929
After I got your profile,I
checked airline records

16:39.930 --> 16:43.809
Turns out derek had just left
chicago when the other body turned up

16:43.810 --> 16:47.410
Tell me the story from the beginning

16:48.800 --> 16:51.450
I- I guess it
starts when I was 15

16:51.470 --> 16:54.994
I was coming home from
football practice one day

16:55.330 --> 16:57.005
Me and
my boy,we were goofing off,

16:57.040 --> 17:00.199
you know,we were
throwing a football around

17:15.400 --> 17:19.358
The only person that
I'd ever seen dead before that was my father

17:19.359 --> 17:20.900
when I was ten

17:20.920 --> 17:23.969
I mean,there I was,I was looking at
this kid and he was my own age,hotch

17:23.970 --> 17:26.160
Dead in this vacant lot

17:26.200 --> 17:28.049
And he was never identified

17:28.050 --> 17:31.519
Nobody knew who he was,nobody
ever even reported him missing

17:31.520 --> 17:33.919
And that,that just
didn't sit right with me

17:33.920 --> 17:37.649
So I-I felt responsible for him,I
mean,I was the one that found him,right

17:37.650 --> 17:40.989
I went around the neighborhood,door
to door,trying to start a collection,

17:40.990 --> 17:46.159
and... eventually I got enough so I could
bury him,and... I gave him a little headstone

17:46.160 --> 17:49.549
What did you put on the
headstone if he wasn't identified

17:49.550 --> 17:51.980
Morgan: Just the date

17:52.770 --> 17:56.394
I left room for a name
if he was ever identified

17:56.650 --> 17:58.059
And you still visit him

17:58.060 --> 18:00.849
Hotch,I go see this
kid every time I'm home

18:00.850 --> 18:03.589
I just feel like he deserves
to have somebody look in on him

18:03.590 --> 18:08.589
Gordinski must read that as a guilty
conscience,a killer revisiting his victim

18:08.590 --> 18:11.209
But that can't be the
only reason he suspects you

18:11.210 --> 18:13.589
Believe me,that guy's had
it in for me my entire life

18:13.590 --> 18:17.270
He's supremely confident
that you're his killer

18:18.010 --> 18:23.829
Then yesterday another kid ends up dead and
the last person he was with was derek morgan

18:23.830 --> 18:26.699
In the boy's pocket we found
one of his fbi business cards,

18:26.700 --> 18:28.369
his cell number written
on the back of it

18:28.370 --> 18:31.439
In fact,every time morgan's
in town,he hangs out with kids

18:31.440 --> 18:32.919
This is all just coincidence

18:32.920 --> 18:34.289
A hell of a lot of coincidences

18:34.290 --> 18:35.869
It's purely circumstantial

18:35.870 --> 18:37.280
So's a fingerprint

18:37.300 --> 18:40.379
Did I mention that morgan
found the body in 1991

18:40.380 --> 18:42.029
Hidden way back in a vacant lot

18:42.030 --> 18:44.379
Now,don't you teach that
when a body is hard to find,

18:44.380 --> 18:47.640
the person finding
it is always a suspect

18:47.920 --> 18:51.349
Reid: There are key pieces of the
profile that don't fit,detective

18:51.350 --> 18:55.320
Uh,the age,25 to 35,morgan
was 15 or so at the time

18:55.340 --> 18:57.629
Also says that age is
the hardest to predict,

18:57.630 --> 19:01.619
and I should never exclude someone simply
because of a discrepancy with the age

19:01.620 --> 19:02.519
What about the speculation

19:02.520 --> 19:04.969
that since he didn't managed to leave
any evidence at the scene of the crime

19:04.970 --> 19:08.639
and he most likely has a criminal record
or previous law enforcement knowledge

19:08.640 --> 19:11.519
Derek wasn't even in the bureau
yet when the first body was found

19:11.520 --> 19:14.329
He may not have had a
knowledge of law enforcement

19:14.330 --> 19:18.010
but derek morgan definitely
had a criminal record

19:29.074 --> 19:31.594
A desperate detective here

19:31.614 --> 19:33.673
Three dead boys,no evidence at all,

19:33.674 --> 19:37.823
so he applies the profile directly
to someone he already suspected

19:37.824 --> 19:39.853
It's easy to get tunnel vision that way

19:39.854 --> 19:43.793
One begins to twist facts to suit
theories instead of theories to suit facts

19:43.794 --> 19:45.963
That's,uh,one of sherlock
holmes's favorite quotes

19:45.964 --> 19:49.883
We need to figure out who really killed
these boys before they decide to charge morgan

19:49.884 --> 19:50.833
What do you want us to do

19:50.834 --> 19:52.883
Last victim was someone
morgan was seen with

19:52.884 --> 19:55.913
Conveniently,morgan was already
a suspect in the other two

19:55.914 --> 19:57.704
Someone set him up

19:57.944 --> 19:59.753
We should consider morgan a victim

19:59.754 --> 20:02.053
Prentiss,you and reid talk to
his family,learn about him-

20:02.054 --> 20:03.713
especially around the
time of the first murder

20:03.714 --> 20:04.713
Do we have the address

20:04.714 --> 20:05.974
I can take you

20:06.564 --> 20:07.513
Oh,that's ok

20:07.514 --> 20:09.913
Gideon: No Actually,that's
not a bad idea

20:09.914 --> 20:10.894
Right

20:11.354 --> 20:13.720
Okey-doke,lead the way,detective

20:16.444 --> 20:18.773
According to morgan,he's got
a bad history with gordinski

20:18.774 --> 20:21.190
He's got a bad history generally

20:21.484 --> 20:24.443
Resisting
arrest,vandalism,aggravated battery

20:24.444 --> 20:26.034
This is morgan

20:26.054 --> 20:27.923
As a juvenile Look at the dates

20:27.924 --> 20:29.763
This isn't in his personnel file

20:29.764 --> 20:31.413
He said he told me everything relevant

20:31.414 --> 20:33.773
Then he either lied or he
doesn't consider this relevant

20:33.774 --> 20:38.154
Since when is the criminal
history of a suspect not relevant

20:38.874 --> 20:41.674
You just called him a suspect

20:46.814 --> 20:48.883
Get garcia into morgan's life

20:48.884 --> 20:50.044
Yes,sir

20:53.354 --> 20:55.364
Hey,hotch,I almost forgot

20:55.384 --> 20:57.543
There's a local banger out
here,his name is rodney harris

20:57.544 --> 20:59.743
He's been running these
streets for a while now

20:59.744 --> 21:01.682
You have a criminal record

21:03.064 --> 21:04.294
What

21:11.704 --> 21:12.673
Where did you get this

21:12.674 --> 21:13.803
What difference does that make

21:13.804 --> 21:17.274
Hotch... this was
supposed to be expunged

21:17.294 --> 21:18.403
My record's clean

21:18.404 --> 21:22.330
I asked you if there was
anything you hadn't told me

21:22.354 --> 21:25.453
A judge expunged this,it
doesn't exist anymore,man

21:25.454 --> 21:26.783
I was a kid,it's nothing

21:26.784 --> 21:28.414
Aggravated battery

21:28.954 --> 21:32.644
I-
Ok

21:32.664 --> 21:36.263
I was with some guys,we got
in a fight with some other guys

21:36.264 --> 21:38.953
Rodney,this cat I'm trying
to tell you about,it was him

21:38.954 --> 21:41.033
We got into it a little bit,we
knocked each other around,

21:41.034 --> 21:43.453
he got a couple stitches in his
head so they made it aggravated

21:43.454 --> 21:44.304
That's it

21:44.324 --> 21:48.623
So you're saying this rodney committed
three murders because you beat him up

21:48.624 --> 21:49.294
No

21:49.314 --> 21:51.703
I'm saying he's been following
me around since I got here,

21:51.704 --> 21:54.063
so go talk to him and
you might get something

21:54.064 --> 21:54.823
This was expunged

21:54.824 --> 21:55.983
You still should've told me

21:55.984 --> 21:58.643
You know how important accurate
information is to victimology

21:58.644 --> 22:02.034
Whoa

22:02.054 --> 22:03.694
Victimology

22:03.714 --> 22:06.923
It's very likely the latest
victim was an attempt to set you up

22:06.924 --> 22:08.534
Are you profiling me

22:08.554 --> 22:09.483
Morgan,we need
to look at- no

22:09.484 --> 22:11.303
We don't need to do anything

22:11.304 --> 22:13.418
Derek,you're in trouble here

22:13.674 --> 22:16.164
Hotch,I didn't do this

22:16.184 --> 22:18.023
I am not worried about
gordinski out there

22:18.024 --> 22:19.303
You still have three dead children

22:19.304 --> 22:22.174
Ok,ok,so you profile them

22:22.194 --> 22:24.224
That's the case

22:24.274 --> 22:26.423
Is there something else you
don't want us to find out about

22:26.424 --> 22:31.508
Hotch,I don't need the people I
work with going into my entire world

22:34.174 --> 22:35.663
Is,uh,derek all right

22:35.664 --> 22:37.253
He wouldn't let us go down there

22:37.254 --> 22:37.963
He's fine

22:37.964 --> 22:38.953
Our boss is with him

22:38.954 --> 22:42.213
Did he tell you gordinski's been
harassing him since he was a kid

22:42.214 --> 22:43.403
Reid: Why's that

22:43.404 --> 22:44.813
You'd have to ask that bastard

22:44.814 --> 22:45.834
Oh,sarah

22:45.854 --> 22:47.234
It's true,mom

22:47.254 --> 22:48.104
Sure it is

22:48.124 --> 22:49.983
What are you even doing
in my mother's house

22:49.984 --> 22:51.504
They asked me

22:51.524 --> 22:52.274
Oh,really

22:52.294 --> 22:55.583
I don't understand how
they could think he did this

22:55.584 --> 22:59.553
Someone may be trying to make
it look like he hurt those kids

22:59.554 --> 23:01.113
And the police believe it

23:01.114 --> 23:02.333
Just following the evidence

23:02.334 --> 23:04.414
But he's an fbi agent

23:04.434 --> 23:06.173
Reid: Actually... law
enforcement officials

23:06.174 --> 23:09.313
are just as probable statistically
to commit a crime as anyone else

23:09.314 --> 23:11.943
Look at the cross-section of a
society,there's a general population

23:11.944 --> 23:14.973
and a small fraction-
he's not actually saying

23:14.974 --> 23:16.823
we believe derek's involved in this

23:16.824 --> 23:18.053
Oh,no,no,yeah,not at all

23:18.054 --> 23:20.844
I'm merely,um-
speaking theoretically

23:21.014 --> 23:22.794
You're dr Reid,right

23:22.814 --> 23:24.124
Mm-hm

23:24.404 --> 23:26.154
Derek talks about you

23:26.174 --> 23:27.034
He does

23:27.054 --> 23:32.023
Anyway,so... someone may be trying
to make it look like this was derek

23:32.024 --> 23:34.134
But derek loves kids

23:34.154 --> 23:36.623
Every time he's here,he
goes to the youth center

23:36.624 --> 23:37.594
Youth center

23:37.614 --> 23:39.123
The upward youth center

23:39.124 --> 23:40.903
Does that have some sort
of significance for him

23:40.904 --> 23:44.453
Oh... are you saying there's
something in it for him

23:44.454 --> 23:47.073
Other than giving back to the
poor kids of your neighborhood

23:47.074 --> 23:51.074
Sarah... sarah,we're
friends of your brother'S

23:51.094 --> 23:52.353
We're here trying to help

23:52.354 --> 23:57.643
When we ask a question,it isn't to
denigrate or demean anything he's done

23:57.644 --> 24:02.473
We just have to know everything,so
we can figure out where to look next

24:02.474 --> 24:05.763
Is there some special
significance to the youth center

24:05.764 --> 24:09.014
The youth center saved his life

24:14.354 --> 24:16.213
Does this make any sense to you

24:16.214 --> 24:17.044
No

24:17.064 --> 24:19.103
He's clearly hiding something else

24:19.104 --> 24:21.283
Well,we know he isn't
involved in any murders

24:21.284 --> 24:22.234
No

24:22.254 --> 24:23.503
There are larger implications

24:23.504 --> 24:26.413
We can't have people on
this team who have secrets

24:26.414 --> 24:28.913
Oh,come on,hotch,we all have secrets

24:28.914 --> 24:31.217
Would you want us profiling you

24:35.864 --> 24:38.223
I feel terrible looking
into his life like this

24:38.224 --> 24:41.183
I know,just remember
we're trying to help him

24:41.184 --> 24:42.392
Garcia: Right,ok

24:42.844 --> 24:45.763
Graduated with honors
from northwestern law

24:45.764 --> 24:47.583
Did you know he was
a star football player

24:47.584 --> 24:50.623
Surprisingly,I don't
know much about him at all

24:50.624 --> 24:51.273
Quarterback

24:51.274 --> 24:53.443
That's the guy who throws the ball,right

24:53.444 --> 24:54.564
Yes

24:54.584 --> 24:57.034
Ha That's what he was

24:57.934 --> 25:00.134
Full ride athletic scholarship

25:00.154 --> 25:04.273
Sophomore year he severely injured
his left knee and he never played again

25:04.274 --> 25:06.273
Ok,garcia,look further back,ok

25:06.274 --> 25:07.404
Before college

25:07.424 --> 25:08.403
Garcia: Right Where are we

25:08.404 --> 25:10.464
Ok,um... wait

25:10.484 --> 25:13.924
He was mentioned in the
chicago register as...

25:17.234 --> 25:21.874
body of a ch-child in
a vacant lot in 1991

25:22.044 --> 25:23.723
That's our first victim

25:23.724 --> 25:25.273
Garcia: He never told me about this

25:25.274 --> 25:27.374
He never told any of us

25:27.394 --> 25:32.844
My husband,um,their father,was
killed when he tried to stop a robbery

25:33.004 --> 25:35.944
Derek was with him,he was ten

25:36.344 --> 25:39.833
A year or so later,he
started getting into trouble

25:39.834 --> 25:40.723
What kind of trouble

25:40.724 --> 25:42.663
He started running
around with older kids

25:42.664 --> 25:45.013
They would give him money
to run errands for them

25:45.014 --> 25:46.684
Not drugs

25:46.704 --> 25:49.443
No,derek would never
disgrace his father's name

25:49.444 --> 25:52.004
But they were gangbangers

25:52.024 --> 25:54.933
So people started looking at
derek like he was one of them

25:54.934 --> 25:59.043
One night,he and a friend were
attacked by some boys from another gang

25:59.044 --> 26:00.004
Big fight

26:00.024 --> 26:04.024
And one of the other
boy's head split open

26:04.044 --> 26:07.193
And that was the first
time gordinski arrested him

26:07.194 --> 26:09.773
Now,he wasn't a detective
yet,just a street cop,

26:09.774 --> 26:14.673
but from that night on,no matter what happened
in the neighborhood,he'd pick derek up for it

26:14.674 --> 26:15.953
Dennison: Probably
because he was involved

26:15.954 --> 26:17.184
The hell he was

26:17.204 --> 26:19.893
Stan's never arrested anyone
who didn't need arresting

26:19.894 --> 26:21.854
He did with derek

26:21.874 --> 26:24.354
Until carl buford stepped in

26:24.374 --> 26:25.354
Carl buford

26:25.374 --> 26:26.863
He runs a youth center

26:26.864 --> 26:28.978
He took derek under his wing

26:29.404 --> 26:30.424
Mentored him

26:30.444 --> 26:32.063
Became like a surrogate father

26:32.064 --> 26:35.413
He taught him football and
that changed derek's life

26:35.414 --> 26:39.383
He got a scholarship to
college,with it he got his degree

26:39.384 --> 26:40.993
Where is carl buford now

26:40.994 --> 26:42.873
He still runs the youth center

26:42.874 --> 26:45.024
I'd like to talk to him

26:45.044 --> 26:47.463
Detective,do you think you
could take me over there

26:47.464 --> 26:48.724
Just you

26:48.744 --> 26:49.534
Yeah

26:49.554 --> 26:53.873
I thought maybe you could stay here
and keep going through this stuff

26:53.874 --> 26:54.934
Good idea

26:54.954 --> 26:56.983
Yeah,keep going through the stuff

26:56.984 --> 26:59.074
Is there a criminal history

26:59.094 --> 27:00.252
Garcia: Criminal

27:01.504 --> 27:04.534
Garcia,is there a criminal history

27:04.554 --> 27:10.064
Jj,there's not gonna be a-
There's a sealed file

27:10.084 --> 27:10.673
Unseal it

27:10.674 --> 27:11.913
But it's a sealed file

27:11.914 --> 27:14.034
Garcia,helping him

27:14.054 --> 27:15.184
Ah

27:15.204 --> 27:16.334
Right

27:16.354 --> 27:21.764
Helping him,helping him...
that's a juvenile criminal record

27:21.784 --> 27:24.473
It was expunged and
sealed by a judge esposito

27:24.474 --> 27:28.283
after presentation of a letter and
testimonial from a local youth center director

27:28.284 --> 27:29.963
"Finest young man I've ever known,

27:29.964 --> 27:33.113
"criminal record could jeopardize
"potential scholarship offers...

27:33.114 --> 27:35.783
stake my personal and
professional reputation..."

27:35.784 --> 27:37.683
garcia: He was definitely
a fan of our boy

27:37.684 --> 27:39.254
Do we have a name

27:39.464 --> 27:40.944
Hang on a second

27:40.964 --> 27:42.143
I'm carl buford

27:42.144 --> 27:45.163
I've brought damien walters'
mother to see detective gordinski

27:45.164 --> 27:45.924
Hi,carl

27:45.944 --> 27:46.654
Stan

27:46.674 --> 27:48.323
Mrs Walters,thanks for coming

27:48.324 --> 27:49.604
This way

27:50.124 --> 27:51.274
Buford

27:51.794 --> 27:54.284
Did you just say buford

28:00.068 --> 28:02.717
would you just give me the hell out here

28:02.718 --> 28:04.847
That wouldn't be a good idea,would it

28:04.848 --> 28:06.568
Says who

28:06.708 --> 28:10.277
Apparently I provided the profile
that led them to arrest you

28:10.278 --> 28:11.838
You what

28:11.858 --> 28:13.947
They sent the case
to me a few months ago

28:13.948 --> 28:18.780
I did a routine consult but he
was looking for it to lead to you

28:21.348 --> 28:23.188
Preconception of guilt

28:24.148 --> 28:27.297
We just can't force 'em to let you go,it's
not gonna look too good with the local press

28:27.298 --> 28:30.620
Oh,like I give a damn
about the press,gideon

28:30.698 --> 28:35.168
Well,we cannot appear to
be covering something up

28:37.208 --> 28:40.017
You trying to say
something to me right now

28:40.018 --> 28:42.957
Only if you're hiding
something You need to trust us

28:42.958 --> 28:44.787
Trust us enough to tell us about it

28:44.788 --> 28:46.168
Gideon

28:46.968 --> 28:49.098
It's not about trust

28:49.378 --> 28:51.920
It's about having a little privacy

28:52.408 --> 28:54.977
I got the right to
keep something to myself

28:54.978 --> 28:58.691
Look at us,man,we practically
live together already

28:58.708 --> 29:03.288
Then the best way to clear
you is...find the real unsub

29:12.978 --> 29:14.907
Find anything out about morgan

29:14.908 --> 29:16.657
The record wasn't picked
up in his background check

29:16.658 --> 29:20.437
because everything in it was expunged
and the file sealed by a judge

29:20.438 --> 29:21.868
Forgiving judge

29:21.888 --> 29:23.147
It was based on the recommendation

29:23.148 --> 29:26.587
of an upstanding member of the community
who took personal responsibility for morgan

29:26.588 --> 29:29.107
That sounds like somebody we
should talk to for more background

29:29.108 --> 29:32.928
Should be easy,he's right over there

29:43.388 --> 29:44.578
Hello

29:44.598 --> 29:45.998
Mr Buford

29:49.828 --> 29:53.027
This guy's been honored by
everybody but the nobel society

29:53.028 --> 29:54.578
That's carl buford

29:54.598 --> 29:56.228
Who are you

29:56.248 --> 29:57.818
I'm with the fbi

29:57.838 --> 29:59.247
Do you know derek morgan

29:59.248 --> 30:00.667
Yeah,he's a friend of mine

30:00.668 --> 30:02.097
I've been trying to call him

30:02.098 --> 30:03.487
He's a little busy right now

30:03.488 --> 30:05.187
Is there something I can do to help you

30:05.188 --> 30:08.588
I just... a friend of mine

30:08.608 --> 30:10.057
Someone killed him yesterday

30:10.058 --> 30:11.957
Do you know something
about who might have done it

30:11.958 --> 30:13.248
No

30:13.268 --> 30:18.197
Derek's always telling me if I need somebody
to talk to,about anything,I can call him

30:18.198 --> 30:22.138
Guess I just wanted to... I don't know

30:22.158 --> 30:22.707
I'll tell you what

30:22.708 --> 30:26.947
Why don't you give me your name and I'll let
him know that you've been trying to reach him

30:26.948 --> 30:29.198
James barfield

30:29.688 --> 30:30.997
Does he know where to find you

30:30.998 --> 30:32.508
He can find me here

30:32.528 --> 30:33.998
Anytime

30:34.018 --> 30:35.688
All the time

30:35.708 --> 30:37.397
You folks work with derek morgan

30:37.398 --> 30:38.698
Yes,sir,closely

30:38.718 --> 30:40.247
You knew him well as a teenager

30:40.248 --> 30:42.077
One of the finest boys I ever coached

30:42.078 --> 30:42.958
Football

30:42.978 --> 30:44.037
I run a youth center

30:44.038 --> 30:48.277
I gather you were instrumental in helping
to get his criminal records expunged

30:48.278 --> 30:49.997
I feel terrible about that now

30:49.998 --> 30:50.848
You do

30:50.868 --> 30:52.317
Well,in view of what's happened

30:52.318 --> 30:54.127
What's happened is a mistake

30:54.128 --> 30:57.727
I'm confused,I thought stan said
there was all kinds of evidence

30:57.728 --> 30:59.643
There is

30:59.678 --> 31:01.687
Thanks,carl,you can take
miss walters home now

31:01.688 --> 31:02.757
Appreciate you bringing her in

31:02.758 --> 31:04.017
Of course,of course

31:04.018 --> 31:05.098
Derek morgan

31:05.118 --> 31:07.027
It's still hard for me to believe

31:07.028 --> 31:08.138
For them,too

31:08.158 --> 31:09.527
I can understand that

31:09.528 --> 31:12.847
Derek had a way of charming people
into looking past his deficiencies

31:12.848 --> 31:14.087
Excuse me,deficiencies

31:14.088 --> 31:15.367
Well,you've seen the records

31:15.368 --> 31:17.337
Derek was at the youth
center yesterday,wasn't he

31:17.338 --> 31:19.737
Playing football with damien
walters and some other boys

31:19.738 --> 31:21.427
Carl's the one that
saw 'em leaving together

31:21.428 --> 31:22.457
Did you talk to him

31:22.458 --> 31:23.527
I was working inside

31:23.528 --> 31:25.377
By the time I was done,they were leaving

31:25.378 --> 31:27.187
When was the last time
you did talk to him

31:27.188 --> 31:28.368
I don't know

31:28.388 --> 31:29.628
Years

31:29.648 --> 31:31.377
If you need anything else,stan

31:31.378 --> 31:32.167
Anything at all

31:32.168 --> 31:32.697
Thanks,carl

31:32.698 --> 31:34.198
Appreciate it

31:38.138 --> 31:40.167
You seem friendly with mr Buford

31:40.168 --> 31:42.667
I can't tell you how many times
that guy's come through for me

31:42.668 --> 31:44.967
Goin' way back to my beat cop days

31:44.968 --> 31:48.057
Carl buford knows the kids in this
neighborhood better than almost anybody

31:48.058 --> 31:50.547
He's knocked more than a few of them
back onto the straight and narrow

31:50.548 --> 31:52.737
Has he kept up with the investigation

31:52.738 --> 31:53.718
I'm sorry

31:53.738 --> 31:55.727
Over the years,does
he ask how it's going

31:55.728 --> 32:00.267
Yeah,he'S... wait a second,you're not gonna try
to turn this off on him to save your guy,are you

32:00.268 --> 32:01.237
Just a question

32:01.238 --> 32:03.458
Carl buford is a local hero

32:03.948 --> 32:05.148
I'm sure he is

32:08.228 --> 32:09.448
Carl buford

32:13.598 --> 32:14.328
What

32:14.348 --> 32:17.016
Carl buford,he runs the youth center

32:19.408 --> 32:20.697
What's that got to do with anything

32:20.698 --> 32:24.037
He's responsible for
getting your records expunged

32:24.038 --> 32:26.147
I told you to stay the
hell out of my business

32:26.148 --> 32:28.278
You said you visit the youth
center every time you come here

32:28.313 --> 32:28.743
So what

32:28.778 --> 32:30.577
Buford says he hasn't
spoken to you in years

32:30.578 --> 32:33.587
Why don't you visit the man
who made your career possible

32:33.588 --> 32:35.638
Damn you,hotch

32:36.158 --> 32:38.307
It is none of your damn business

32:38.308 --> 32:42.267
Buford's the one who told
detectives you were with damien

32:42.268 --> 32:44.668
I am warning you,hotch

32:46.028 --> 32:47.808
Back off

32:51.648 --> 32:53.607
I'm not saying it's mr Buford

32:53.608 --> 32:56.077
There's a huge amount of
investigation left to be done

32:56.078 --> 32:59.427
For 15 years he hasn't been
the slightest bit suspicious

32:59.428 --> 33:01.597
Morgan won't even talk about buford

33:01.598 --> 33:02.338
He won't

33:02.358 --> 33:04.177
Buford should be that kid's hero

33:04.178 --> 33:05.147
Something happened

33:05.148 --> 33:06.447
You talking about carl buford

33:06.448 --> 33:07.228
Yes

33:07.248 --> 33:08.858
We just left his office

33:08.893 --> 33:10.478
Dennison: Hey

33:11.468 --> 33:13.548
What,did we turn him loose

33:21.938 --> 33:23.648
You let him escape

33:30.232 --> 33:34.162
Black male,33,six foot
one,name is derek morgan

33:34.182 --> 33:35.391
You're standing there
trying to convince me

33:35.392 --> 33:40.091
that a local hero is my killer while you
let my suspect dance our the back door

33:40.092 --> 33:42.684
I'm gonna charge all of your asses

34:10.931 --> 34:12.752
Yes,as soon as possible

34:13.141 --> 34:15.400
You have to tell your officers
that morgan's not a threat

34:15.402 --> 34:16.431
Like hell I will

34:16.431 --> 34:20.773
But this- lady,as far as I'm
concerned,he is a threat,ok

34:23.742 --> 34:24.851
They're beyond reason

34:24.851 --> 34:26.071
We have to find hm first

34:26.072 --> 34:26.911
Any ideas

34:26.931 --> 34:30.331
His mother said that buford practically
raised him after his father died,

34:30.331 --> 34:33.101
he mentored him,took him on
trips,spent all of his time with him

34:33.101 --> 34:35.400
Basically became a surrogate father

34:35.402 --> 34:37.731
Jason,I think I know what
he was afraid we'd find

34:37.732 --> 34:40.702
Detective,we may know where he's heading

34:43.331 --> 34:45.152
Lookin' good there,kid

34:46.812 --> 34:48.674
I was tryin' to call you

34:49.252 --> 34:50.722
I'm here now

34:52.722 --> 34:54.542
Someone killed damien

34:56.242 --> 34:57.912
I know

35:03.202 --> 35:06.109
James,we need to talk about carl buford

35:06.492 --> 35:08.182
What about him

35:08.892 --> 35:10.880
You're a star player,right

35:11.132 --> 35:12.702
Center of attention

35:13.002 --> 35:14.882
Yeah,I guess

35:16.092 --> 35:17.231
You know,I used to be that guy

35:17.232 --> 35:18.802
Yeah,I know

35:19.522 --> 35:21.611
It's a lot of pressure,isn't it

35:21.612 --> 35:23.652
Always wanna make 'em happy

35:23.792 --> 35:25.062
Impress 'em

35:25.572 --> 35:27.242
I can handle it

35:27.262 --> 35:29.602
Oh,I'm sure you can,kid

35:34.112 --> 35:36.704
Does he ever take you to his cabin

35:36.812 --> 35:37.462
What

35:37.482 --> 35:40.282
Fishin' in wisconsin,camping

35:40.302 --> 35:42.861
Do things you wish you
had a real father for

35:42.862 --> 35:44.332
Sometimes

35:46.892 --> 35:49.192
Yeah,he's good like that

35:50.992 --> 35:53.082
You know about the cabin

35:55.652 --> 35:58.231
James,i told you,I used to be you

35:59.752 --> 36:01.762
What do you mean

36:15.812 --> 36:19.864
The first time you weren't
even sure what was goin' on

36:21.892 --> 36:25.092
He brushed up against you

36:26.442 --> 36:29.903
You thought it might
have just been an accident

36:31.992 --> 36:36.157
But then at the cabin,he let
you sit and drink with him

36:37.742 --> 36:40.212
You thought it was kinda cool

36:41.062 --> 36:42.942
Made you feel grown

36:42.962 --> 36:45.063
He gave you a glass of wine

36:46.232 --> 36:49.212
Maybe a little shot of something harder

36:52.472 --> 36:55.362
And then he took you swimming

36:55.802 --> 36:59.678
Only he told you to jump
in without your swimsuit on

37:01.772 --> 37:04.540
He did things to you,james,didn't he

37:09.982 --> 37:13.452
He did 'em to me,too

37:13.962 --> 37:16.151
You do whatever you think
you gotta do to keep him happy

37:16.152 --> 37:18.971
because he's the closest
thing to a father you got

37:18.972 --> 37:21.772
But what he's doin' to you is wrong

37:21.922 --> 37:24.051
And you don't have
to let it continue,man

37:24.052 --> 37:25.772
- Yeah,I do

37:25.792 --> 37:31.471
My oldest brother's in jail,my sister was
paralyzed in a drive-by,she's eight years old

37:31.472 --> 37:33.942
I'm all my mom's got left

37:34.022 --> 37:36.562
I gotta get us outta here

37:36.762 --> 37:39.231
Carl's gonna make
sure I get into college

37:39.232 --> 37:40.711
Then I can make something of myself

37:40.712 --> 37:42.331
James,you are something,man

37:42.332 --> 37:44.621
You're something right
here,right now,without carl buford

37:44.622 --> 37:46.031
You just gotta believe that

37:46.032 --> 37:47.801
Where's carl right now,huh

37:47.802 --> 37:49.732
Look at you,man

37:50.112 --> 37:51.831
You're out here in the
dark running pass routes

37:51.832 --> 37:52.832
That's you

37:52.852 --> 37:55.746
That ain't got nothin' to do with carl

37:58.012 --> 38:03.461
What you got inside of here,that's
what's gonna get you off these streets

38:03.552 --> 38:05.172
You never told

38:06.572 --> 38:08.752
Not until right now

38:10.862 --> 38:13.241
Damien always said I should call you

38:13.242 --> 38:15.112
What

38:16.302 --> 38:18.052
Damien knew

38:18.152 --> 38:20.555
I didn't think you'd believe me

38:21.442 --> 38:26.212
James... I got your back

38:27.202 --> 38:29.502
Forever

38:41.182 --> 38:42.652
Carl

38:49.432 --> 38:51.002
You've been let go

38:51.022 --> 38:52.812
Looks that way

38:53.132 --> 38:57.261
I told 'em it was crazy,thinkin'
you were involved in any killing

38:57.262 --> 38:58.772
Really

38:58.792 --> 39:01.681
Gordinski said you're the one
who told 'em I drove damien home

39:01.682 --> 39:03.541
Was that supposed to be a secret

39:03.542 --> 39:05.162
No

39:05.182 --> 39:07.442
That wasn'T

39:07.462 --> 39:09.772
I don't follow

39:12.672 --> 39:17.222
All these years,I kept my mouth shut

39:18.702 --> 39:21.902
I let you go on being a hero

39:22.072 --> 39:23.982
Carl buford,my mentor

39:24.002 --> 39:24.951
What are you talkin' about

39:24.952 --> 39:27.492
God,I was so afraid of you

39:28.542 --> 39:34.062
I was afraid of the police,afraid
of losing everything I was gaining

39:34.582 --> 39:37.081
But that's how you work,isn't it

39:37.082 --> 39:40.821
You make sure there's a hell
of a lot to lose,don't you

39:40.822 --> 39:42.401
I don't know what you think you remember

39:42.402 --> 39:45.991
No,no,no See,it's not what I
remember that's gonna hurt you,carl

39:45.992 --> 39:48.681
Our business is over way
too long ago to matter

39:48.682 --> 39:53.271
You're protected by a statute of
limitations and that's my fault

39:53.272 --> 39:54.702
Then good night

39:54.722 --> 39:57.112
You set me up

39:57.132 --> 40:01.323
You knew damien walters wanted
james to call me about you

40:01.372 --> 40:03.062
So you killed him

40:04.342 --> 40:07.451
You killed him because you knew
I'd come after you,didn't you

40:07.452 --> 40:09.031
Now you're just talking crazy

40:09.032 --> 40:12.061
God,I should have told somebody
about you when I was a kid

40:12.062 --> 40:14.522
When you were helping me

40:15.562 --> 40:17.961
Well,you know what
happens in cases like this

40:17.962 --> 40:20.702
Once that dam breaks,the flood comes

40:21.712 --> 40:23.601
One kid steps up,just one

40:23.602 --> 40:25.721
And then another one,and another

40:25.722 --> 40:27.801
Because they're not
scared of you anymore

40:27.802 --> 40:29.641
They know they're not alone

40:29.642 --> 40:31.371
James barfield is your dam

40:31.372 --> 40:33.761
Whatever lies james told
you... they're not lies

40:33.762 --> 40:35.321
You did the same thing to me

40:35.322 --> 40:37.732
I did nothing to you,to james

40:37.752 --> 40:41.531
One by one,they're gonna pile up
until there's so many accusations

40:41.532 --> 40:43.271
- You can't say that they're all lies

40:43.272 --> 40:47.261
any idea how many kids I've
helped get out of this neighborhood

40:47.262 --> 40:48.242
Hm

40:48.262 --> 40:51.592
How many lives I've provided

40:51.722 --> 40:55.322
Look at you. You'd
probaby be dead by now.

40:55.342 --> 40:58.052
yeah,well,it wasn't for free,was it

40:58.162 --> 41:00.351
I pulled you out of the gutter

41:00.352 --> 41:03.651
I pulled myself out of the
gutter,all the way to the fbi

41:03.652 --> 41:04.602
I did that

41:04.622 --> 41:08.976
You sayin' I had nothin' to
do with making you who you are

41:09.852 --> 41:11.492
No,carl

41:13.092 --> 41:18.239
Actually I'm saying you have
everything to do with making me who I am

41:19.222 --> 41:22.121
Because of you I'm somebody who
gets to spend the rest of this life

41:22.122 --> 41:24.201
making sure guys like you go down

41:24.202 --> 41:29.662
Look,derek... carl: I never hurt you

41:32.832 --> 41:35.362
You could have said no

41:40.342 --> 41:43.082
You're under arrest,carl

41:44.812 --> 41:46.511
I've helped a lot of kids

41:46.512 --> 41:48.332
Let's go

41:49.002 --> 41:51.211
The neighborhood won't
be the same without me

41:51.212 --> 41:53.381
It's gonna be worse without the center

41:53.382 --> 41:55.691
Somebody'll keep this center running

41:55.692 --> 41:57.181
The neighborhood will

41:57.182 --> 41:58.212
I will

41:58.232 --> 42:00.442
Wait Wait

42:04.132 --> 42:09.382
DereK... isn't there
something you can do for me

42:09.672 --> 42:11.662
You go to hell
