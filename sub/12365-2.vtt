WEBVTT

00:38.414 --> 00:39.995
[truck door closes]

00:43.419 --> 00:45.501
You said you found something?

00:45.713 --> 00:48.921
There was dirt in a shell
inside the shotgun

00:49.133 --> 00:50.964
Branch used to kill himself.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.553
How does that happen?

00:55.765 --> 00:57.596
Whoever fired the shotgun

00:57.808 --> 01:01.471
must've ejected the shell,
probably out of habit.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.473
That created a problem.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.645
Now it doesn't look
like a suicide.

01:05.858 --> 01:08.065
Because a dead man
could not eject his own shell.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.609
So, Branch's killer picked up

01:10.821 --> 01:13.483
the, uh,
spent shell off the ground,

01:13.699 --> 01:17.283
put it back in the shotgun.

01:17.495 --> 01:19.907
[Henry]
And then stages the scene.

01:20.081 --> 01:21.537
[Walt]
Yeah.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.614
So...

01:23.834 --> 01:26.211
I need to see
if the dirt from here

01:26.420 --> 01:28.502
matches the dirt in the shell.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.124
If it doesn't,

01:30.383 --> 01:34.922
that proves
that the body was moved.

01:35.096 --> 01:38.054
You think Nighthorse
did all of this?

01:38.266 --> 01:40.723
I do, and he knows that I do.

01:40.935 --> 01:43.017
He came by my cabin
with a few dozen friends

01:43.229 --> 01:45.015
just as a warning.

01:45.231 --> 01:48.473
-[static]
-[Ruby] Walt? Walt, you there?

01:53.239 --> 01:54.604
Yep.

01:54.824 --> 01:56.280
Couple of spooked kids
just called in.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.201
That might be outside
my jurisdiction.

02:05.418 --> 02:06.999
They said they heard
Asian voices, Walt,

02:07.253 --> 02:09.744
out by War Eagle.

02:12.258 --> 02:13.373
Thanks, Ruby.

02:13.593 --> 02:15.834
l'll head out at first light.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.759
[Henry]
First light?

02:17.972 --> 02:22.682
Why not drive to War Eagle now
while it is still dark?

02:22.893 --> 02:25.100
It's a two-hour drive,
and I'm busy.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.519
I could go with you,

02:26.731 --> 02:28.437
perhaps hold your hand
this time.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.480
I wasn't that afraid.

02:30.693 --> 02:33.480
-You whimpered.
-l was 12.

02:34.739 --> 02:36.024
Fine.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.946
I'll do it.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.531
lcan't think what else to do
about Branch's murder right now

02:43.748 --> 02:47.582
except get these soil samples
analyzed.

02:49.045 --> 02:51.502
You can do that a lot faster
than I can.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.789
My botanist friend
at the university.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.169
Can you call in a favor?

02:56.385 --> 02:58.467
Sure.

03:03.059 --> 03:06.392
-What is this for?
-I need to deputize you.

03:06.604 --> 03:10.267
Make sure the chain of custody
is airtight.

03:10.483 --> 03:11.939
I don't want Nighthorse
wriggling out

03:12.151 --> 03:14.107
from under a murder charge
on some technicality.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.076
Whose badge is this?

03:26.207 --> 03:28.493
Branch's.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.860
As soon as Henry gets those,
uh, soil samples tested,

03:58.072 --> 03:58.777
patch him through.

03:58.989 --> 03:59.819
Thanks, Ruby.

04:00.032 --> 04:01.613
Those tests take weeks.

04:01.826 --> 04:03.407
[Walt]
Henry knows someone.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.489
So, where are we headed
to again?

04:06.706 --> 04:08.116
War Eagle.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.664
[Vic] And what is that,
a Cheyenne ghost town?

04:10.876 --> 04:12.912
Ruby said it might be haunted.

04:13.129 --> 04:15.541
It's a former World War II
internment camp

04:15.756 --> 04:17.667
for Japanese Americans.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.857
[Vic]
You been here before?

04:41.073 --> 04:42.062
[Walt]
Once.

04:42.283 --> 04:44.365
[Vic]
You hear voices?

04:44.577 --> 04:47.159
Henry claimed
he heard some whimpering.

04:47.371 --> 04:48.872
ldon't believe him, though.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.787
[chuckles]

04:56.338 --> 05:00.172
Looks like those teens did more
than just hear voices.

05:06.766 --> 05:08.927
What is it?

05:09.143 --> 05:10.633
Amateur radio tower.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.186
Receiver must be inside.

05:14.398 --> 05:16.229
That would explain
the foreign voices.

05:17.443 --> 05:19.809
-You hope so.
-[Walt] Yeah.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.037
Anyone there?

05:35.252 --> 05:36.708
[radio chatter]

05:36.921 --> 05:38.161
Hello?

05:54.730 --> 05:56.345
[man]
Hello?

05:56.565 --> 05:59.398
Those drunk teens must've heard
the HAM radio last night.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.901
Someone's done a lot of work
since I was here last.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.448
-[Vic] And when was that?
-[Walt] Seventh grade.

06:08.661 --> 06:11.448
So, then everything here
is a historical artifact?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.376
Huh.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.166
I guess so.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.084
Except for this.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.424
Bingo.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.953
Maybe there's ID. on the body.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.298
There's no need.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.964
That's Thorvin Hampton.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.882
He's been, uh...

07:08.095 --> 07:09.596
working here for years

07:09.805 --> 07:12.763
trying to renovate this place,
turn it into a memorial.

07:15.686 --> 07:16.892
[Vic]
Sorry, Walt.

07:18.147 --> 07:19.182
Do you know the family?

07:20.357 --> 07:22.313
I don't know
if he's got any left.

07:22.526 --> 07:26.940
Both our fathers
were VFW drinking buddies.

07:27.156 --> 07:30.148
Thorvin was an only child.
ldon't think he ever married.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.107
[Vic]
Smart man.

07:36.457 --> 07:37.867
Okay.

07:38.083 --> 07:43.749
So, there's no blood,
no cuts, no bruising.

07:45.007 --> 07:47.669
There's no visible signs
of foul play.

07:47.885 --> 07:50.251
Other than being locked
inside this room.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.678
What, you think he was killed
somewhere else and dumped here?

07:54.767 --> 07:56.632
Thorvin was alive
when he was locked in here.

07:56.852 --> 07:58.433
Check his fingernails.

08:02.441 --> 08:04.352
[Vic]
Splinters.

08:04.568 --> 08:05.683
[Walt]
Yep.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.943
He tried to claw his way out.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.112
-Maybe he had a heart attack.
-Or exposure.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.243
[knocks]

08:16.455 --> 08:18.116
They put up these barracks

08:18.332 --> 08:19.663
quick and cheap
back in the '405.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.331
There was no insulation.

08:24.713 --> 08:28.001
You know,
maybe those drunk teens

08:28.258 --> 08:31.921
break into the donation box,
steal the money.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.002
Hampton catches them in the act.
They panic.

08:34.223 --> 08:36.054
They overpower him.
They lock him in here.

08:36.266 --> 08:37.426
[Walt]
Yeah.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.892
[Vic] You know,
I can take the lead on this.

08:41.105 --> 08:42.515
I'm sure you'd rather, uh,

08:42.731 --> 08:44.596
focus on investigating
Branch's murder anyway.

08:44.817 --> 08:46.148
[sighs] I would.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.100
But I can do both.

08:49.071 --> 08:50.777
Why don't you go ahead
and track down

08:50.990 --> 08:53.823
those teens that called Ruby,
check their stories.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.535
-You sure?
-I am.

08:56.537 --> 08:59.074
I wasn't elected
just to solve crimes

08:59.289 --> 09:01.371
when it was convenient.

09:01.583 --> 09:02.447
Okay.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.582
[sighs]

09:23.522 --> 09:25.638
[indistinct conversations]

09:39.747 --> 09:42.113
Hope you're not cruising around
on the company dime.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.583
What are you doing out here?

09:43.792 --> 09:45.953
Signing up for night classes.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.672
Employees are like family
to Malachi.

09:51.884 --> 09:55.126
He doesn't want to see them
making bad decisions

09:55.345 --> 09:57.427
or hanging out
with shady characters.

09:57.639 --> 09:58.924
Then I better get going.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.052
I would not want Malachi
to see me talking to you

10:01.268 --> 10:02.804
and get the wrong idea.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.851
[engine turns over]

10:19.286 --> 10:21.242
Thorvin grew up in this house.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.741
He must've moved back in
after his parents died.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.458
[radio chatter]

10:25.626 --> 10:26.866
Whoa.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.553
[radio turns off]

10:43.685 --> 10:46.472
There's a lot of classic rigs
in this place.

10:46.688 --> 10:50.601
That's an '82 Cobra
with the original mike.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.433
You know your way
around this equipment.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.860
Remember when my dad used
to drive truck when l was a kid?

10:55.072 --> 10:56.187
Yeah.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.567
CB's how he kept in touch.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.274
Ah.

11:00.536 --> 11:03.152
Looks like Thorvin was in touch
with a lot of folks.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.363
[Ferg] CBers tend
to be really friendly,

11:05.582 --> 11:08.790
but there's a lot of crazy
loners out there, too.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.583
Got in this argument
when l was in high school

11:10.796 --> 11:12.332
with a trucker

11:12.548 --> 11:15.290
about whether Elway or Marino
was a better quarterback.

11:16.218 --> 11:18.083
That's a pretty one-sided
argument.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.463
[Ferg]
Not to this guy.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.295
Scary thing is,
he tracked me down

11:21.557 --> 11:23.468
by monitoring
my signal strength.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.015
I didn't realize it
until he was right behind me

11:25.227 --> 11:27.058
trying to run my car
off the road.

11:27.271 --> 11:29.557
What was your handle?

11:33.235 --> 11:34.941
High Plains Drifter.

11:37.614 --> 11:41.152
Well, High Plains Drifter,

11:41.368 --> 11:42.528
why don't you see
if you can reach

11:42.744 --> 11:46.032
any of Thorvin's, uh,
recent contacts?

11:46.248 --> 11:48.455
Try to refrain from arguing
religion, politics,

11:48.709 --> 11:50.916
or AFC quarterbacks.

11:51.128 --> 11:53.244
Anything I should
be looking for in particular?

11:53.463 --> 11:55.749
Well, uh, looks like

11:55.966 --> 11:58.548
Thorvin's two passions
were radios and history.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.466
See if either of them got him

12:00.679 --> 12:03.546
into any heated arguments
lately.

12:03.765 --> 12:06.598
People don't like to be reminded
about that internment camp.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.893
[Ferg] Why was Thorvin
so interested in War Eagle?

12:10.105 --> 12:14.314
I don't know.
I do know he was rounding 60.

12:14.526 --> 12:17.768
And history gets heavier
the older you get, so...

12:19.615 --> 12:21.731
[cellphone rings]

12:21.950 --> 12:22.700
[beep]

12:22.910 --> 12:24.866
Hello?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.329
Yeah.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.033
Vic.

12:29.833 --> 12:30.663
Yeah.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.124
So, I talked to the two kids

12:32.336 --> 12:34.247
who called Ruby
about the voices.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.875
Both admit to being high
on mushrooms and trespassing,

12:37.090 --> 12:38.250
but they said they got scared
and ran off

12:38.467 --> 12:40.298
before they reached
the barracks.

12:40.510 --> 12:44.253
They also said that there was
a third kid named Caleb Jacky

12:44.473 --> 12:46.885
who did make it
all the way up to the camp.

12:52.856 --> 12:55.142
[Walt]
Vic, you still there?

12:55.359 --> 12:57.441
Sean.Sean.Sean.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.314
[breathing heavily]

12:59.529 --> 13:00.814
[screams]

13:07.454 --> 13:09.570
Vic, you still there?

13:12.084 --> 13:13.790
I think I'm gonna need
some backup.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.583
Okay.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.834
[indistinct shouting]

13:21.760 --> 13:23.125
Sorry to drag you
all the way out here.

13:23.345 --> 13:24.801
I know you got
a lot on your plate.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.002
No, it was smart.

13:26.223 --> 13:27.554
Last thing I want
is another deputy

13:27.766 --> 13:29.131
putting their life at risk.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.101
Which way?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.722
[shouting continues]

13:38.944 --> 13:41.151
[crowd cheering,
rock music playing]

13:43.115 --> 13:44.070
Bring it on, bro!

13:49.788 --> 13:53.872
II My dreams
turn into nightmares J‘J‘

13:54.084 --> 13:58.123
J‘J‘ What have I become? J‘J‘

14:00.048 --> 14:01.834
[crowd groans]

14:04.344 --> 14:06.380
[indistinct shouting]

14:10.851 --> 14:12.762
[cheers and applause]

14:17.441 --> 14:21.855
I've re-emerged
from the collective unconscious!

14:22.070 --> 14:24.686
lam everything you fear!

14:24.906 --> 14:27.818
lam Nightmare Fuel!

14:28.035 --> 14:29.821
[crowd cheering]

14:30.037 --> 14:35.248
Who else dares dip into the dark
recesses of the human mind?

14:35.459 --> 14:36.448
I do.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.914
[Rett] So, what did
my jackass of a son do now?

14:40.130 --> 14:41.620
We were just trying
to figure that out.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.955
I'll take that, son.

14:43.759 --> 14:46.250
So, uh, we talked
to your son's friends,

14:46.470 --> 14:47.880
Bradley and Spencer,

14:48.096 --> 14:49.927
so we know he was at War Eagle
last night.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.175
[Rett]
War Eagle?

14:51.391 --> 14:52.631
You said you were
over at Spencer's

14:52.851 --> 14:54.216
watching old Summerslam tapes.

14:54.436 --> 14:55.676
l was.

14:55.896 --> 14:56.851
But then I stepped out

14:57.064 --> 14:58.770
just for, like, a minute or two.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.893
Did you see anyone
while you were up at the camp?

15:01.109 --> 15:03.725
Someone you were worried
might get you in trouble?

15:03.945 --> 15:05.481
Caleb.

15:05.781 --> 15:09.319
Stand up straight, look them
in the eye, tell the truth.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.570
[sighs]
We just wanted to explore

15:11.787 --> 15:13.072
the old Jap internment camp

15:13.288 --> 15:14.494
to see if it was really haunted.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.037
We didn't see anything.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.534
But we heard some voices,

15:17.751 --> 15:19.912
so we ran back to Spencer's car
and left.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.163
That's it?

15:21.380 --> 15:23.371
Yeah. That's it.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.956
Because someone broke in
to the War Eagle donation box

15:26.176 --> 15:27.165
and took some money.

15:27.386 --> 15:28.626
You know anything about that?

15:28.845 --> 15:30.255
[scoffs] No.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.178
What about the dead body
that we found

15:32.391 --> 15:34.427
locked in one of the barracks
buildings this morning?

15:34.643 --> 15:36.133
A dead body?

15:36.353 --> 15:37.718
I told you I didn't see anything
up there.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.144
All I heard were those voices.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.142
Are you sure?
You seem frightened.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.895
Maybe you put the caretaker
in some kind of sleeper hold,

15:44.111 --> 15:45.021
dragged him inside.

15:45.237 --> 15:46.693
[Rett]
Wait a second.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.566
Thorvin Hampton
was the one killed?

15:48.782 --> 15:49.817
You knew him?

15:50.033 --> 15:51.534
[Rett]
Well, he's hard to miss.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.324
Walking up and down this county

15:53.537 --> 15:55.653
picking at scabs
that've been healed for decades.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.363
You think Thorvin might've done
something to get himself killed?

15:58.583 --> 16:01.325
Well, he was provoking people
enough.

16:01.545 --> 16:05.083
Hear him talk, you'd think
we built Auschwitz up there.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.005
We were at war.

16:07.926 --> 16:09.427
Heard of Pearl Harbor?

16:09.636 --> 16:11.797
Japanese attacked us.

16:12.556 --> 16:14.592
It's hard to know who was a spy
and who wasn't.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.719
And those internment camps,

16:16.935 --> 16:19.096
they were
for their protection anyway.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.439
You ask me,

16:21.648 --> 16:24.139
we don't have a damn thing
to apologize for.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.691
Sounds like Caleb's father
had more of an interest

16:30.991 --> 16:34.108
in going after Thorvin Hampton
than Caleb did.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.033
Find out what you can
about the Jackys

16:36.246 --> 16:37.531
and their interactions
with Thorvin.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.362
I'll go check
the autopsy report.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.040
Maybe the body shows signs
of a choke hold or something.

16:42.252 --> 16:43.537
Okay.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.368
Should probably leave that here.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.554
[bat thuds]

16:57.893 --> 16:59.554
Hello, Ruby.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.976
This is Deputy Standing Bear.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.726
Could you patch me through
to the sheriff, please?

17:05.942 --> 17:07.898
[Ruby]
Walt. Got Henry for you.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.061
What'd you find out?

17:11.281 --> 17:12.521
[Henry]
My friend from the university

17:12.699 --> 17:13.984
ran a preliminary test.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.941
The soil type from the creek bed

17:16.161 --> 17:18.743
and from the shotgun shell
do appear to be different.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.365
So, the body was moved.

17:20.582 --> 17:21.913
Not necessarily.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.535
Apparently different soil types

17:23.752 --> 17:26.368
can exist just feet apart
from one another,

17:26.588 --> 17:28.453
but the dirt
from the shotgun shell

17:28.673 --> 17:30.174
does have pollen in it.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.839
What does that mean?

17:32.052 --> 17:33.508
It means that we have to wait

17:33.720 --> 17:35.881
for my friend to run
another series of tests.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.388
lpushed,
but it may take a day or two.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.885
Also, you were right
to be concerned

17:40.101 --> 17:41.136
about Nighthorse.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.344
Darius Burns followed me
to the university,

17:44.564 --> 17:47.055
which means
Malachi's having me followed.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.482
At Nighthorse's request,
I'm sure.

17:49.694 --> 17:50.809
Keep an eye out.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.894
I already am.

18:13.176 --> 18:16.384
[Alicia] Dear Hector,
they say that you're dead.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.133
I don't want to believe that.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.010
My name's Alicia Musgraves.

18:21.226 --> 18:24.218
I'm the mother
of a beautiful boy named Louie.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.018
I do everything I can
to raise him right,

18:26.273 --> 18:29.686
but I have this neighbor,
Lane Potter.

18:29.901 --> 18:34.270
He's come over and stolen money
from me twice already.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.940
He says that no one
will believe me, though,

18:38.201 --> 18:40.237
because I used to be a junkie.

18:40.453 --> 18:45.072
Lane Potter has taken $220
from us so far.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.532
I don't want you to hurt him.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.959
[just want him to stop.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.914
I still believe
that you're out there, Hector.

18:55.343 --> 18:58.255
Nia'ish, Alicia.

19:00.265 --> 19:02.506
Mommy. Can I get this?

19:09.524 --> 19:11.310
[Alicia] Sweetie,
Mommy doesn't have

19:11.526 --> 19:12.982
enough money for all this food.

19:13.194 --> 19:14.570
[Louie]
Okay.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.690
[Alicia] I'm gonna have to put
some of it back.

19:17.907 --> 19:22.867
Like, uh, the sprinkle cheese,
the applesauce.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.694
We can put this back, too.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.286
[Alicia]
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

19:30.837 --> 19:35.046
That is a crystal-clear
10-4 there, Sunshine Sally.

19:36.301 --> 19:38.132
This here
is High Plains Drifter.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.676
[Sally] Hey, there,
High Plains Drifter.

19:40.889 --> 19:43.005
You're coming in
big and strong.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.052
I'm looking for a 10-35

19:45.352 --> 19:47.388
on a fella named
Thorvin Hampton,

19:47.604 --> 19:49.970
also known as, uh, Toe Tapper.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.556
Ah, Toe Tapper.

19:52.776 --> 19:53.856
[click]

20:07.957 --> 20:09.663
[gunshot]

20:17.926 --> 20:20.542
So, it turns out our father,
Rett Jacky,

20:20.762 --> 20:22.844
did have a run-in with
our victim a couple months ago

20:23.056 --> 20:25.342
in the parking lot
of a restaurant

20:25.600 --> 20:29.559
called General Custard's
Last Frozen Treat Stand.

20:33.108 --> 20:34.439
How bad of a run-in?

20:34.651 --> 20:36.107
It was bad enough
that we were called in

20:36.319 --> 20:37.069
to settle things down.

20:37.278 --> 20:38.404
I don't remember

20:38.613 --> 20:40.319
being called in on that.

20:40.532 --> 20:43.239
Uh, no, you weren't.
Um, it was Branch.

20:45.704 --> 20:48.446
And according
to Branch's report,

20:48.665 --> 20:50.326
Thorvin Hampton complained
that Rett Jacky

20:50.542 --> 20:52.157
had been harassing him
for weeks.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.204
That's Branch's computer, right?

21:00.135 --> 21:01.716
Find anything new?

21:02.387 --> 21:05.754
[sighs] Only his supposed,
uh, suicide note,

21:06.015 --> 21:08.722
which we now know
he didn't write.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.396
The weird thing about that note

21:12.605 --> 21:14.641
is that it actually does sound
like Branch.

21:14.858 --> 21:16.519
I mean, crazy Branch, but...

21:17.819 --> 21:19.605
Sounds like him.

21:26.369 --> 21:29.827
That's because whoever wrote it
knew Branch well.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.530
Maybe Nighthorse
left us some prints.

21:42.010 --> 21:43.671
| just talked with a local CBer

21:43.887 --> 21:45.627
who appears to be the world's
leading expert

21:45.847 --> 21:47.678
on the topic of Thorvin Hampton.

21:51.269 --> 21:54.136
[Walt]
So, I gather you knew him well?

21:54.355 --> 21:56.186
[Sally]
Me and Thorvin were soul mates.

21:56.399 --> 22:00.688
Or rather Sunshine Sally
and Toe Tapper were soul mates.

22:00.904 --> 22:03.065
You two talked a lot?

22:03.281 --> 22:05.647
We'd chew the rag
until the morning hours.

22:05.867 --> 22:07.949
About everything under the sun.

22:08.912 --> 22:10.823
Did Thorvin
tell you about his plans

22:11.039 --> 22:12.870
for reopening the camp?

22:13.082 --> 22:14.947
Talked about it all the time.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.453
You know, back in the war,

22:19.589 --> 22:21.705
How did Thorvin feel about that?

22:21.925 --> 22:23.256
[Sally]
Made him sick.

22:23.468 --> 22:25.550
I guess his father
and some other soldiers

22:25.762 --> 22:27.252
would even go into orphanages

22:27.472 --> 22:31.385
and round up little
Japanese babies for the camp.

22:31.601 --> 22:32.807
Babies.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.759
What were they gonna do?

22:34.979 --> 22:36.355
Drool on us to death?

22:36.564 --> 22:38.065
[scoffs]

22:38.274 --> 22:41.391
Is that why he started
the memorial, out of guilt?

22:41.611 --> 22:44.227
That and curiosity
about his half-brother.

22:44.447 --> 22:46.654
What half-brother?

22:46.866 --> 22:48.652
His father slept
with a young Japanese woman

22:48.868 --> 22:50.654
at the camp named Birdie.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.326
She got pregnant.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.530
The old man never bothered
to tell Thorvin

22:54.791 --> 22:56.998
about his half-brother
till he was on his deathbed.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.620
Did Thorvin ever find him?

22:58.837 --> 23:00.919
[Sally]
If he did, he would've told me.

23:02.799 --> 23:04.630
We told each other everything.

23:10.849 --> 23:12.885
On the table.

23:13.685 --> 23:16.552
Okay, uh,
go over the registration records

23:16.771 --> 23:19.183
for any male babies
born at War Eagle.

23:19.399 --> 23:20.809
See what you can find out.

23:21.025 --> 23:22.936
-Thanks, Vic.
-[beep]

23:23.152 --> 23:26.770
Want you to head over
to Thorvin's house.

23:26.990 --> 23:29.276
He may have some more secrets
we don't know about.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.073
Can you imagine?

23:31.286 --> 23:34.028
Somebody comes up to you
and says he's your half-brother.

23:34.247 --> 23:36.158
That his father
got your mother pregnant

23:36.374 --> 23:38.285
while she was in a prison camp.

23:39.252 --> 23:42.164
Is that gonna be a happy
family reunion?

23:42.380 --> 23:44.166
Not likely.

23:45.008 --> 23:47.465
[indistinct conversations]

23:53.975 --> 23:56.011
-[Alicia] Ready to go to class?
-[Louie] Yes, lam.

23:56.227 --> 23:59.014
l have my glasses, my lunch.

24:56.955 --> 24:58.695
So, I went through
the War Eagle records,

24:58.915 --> 25:00.906
and there were 25 male children
born there

25:01.125 --> 25:02.786
during the time
that it was open.

25:03.628 --> 25:08.418
Any of them now living
near Idaho Falls or Pocatello?

25:08.633 --> 25:10.544
[Vic]
Um...

25:10.760 --> 25:12.921
A guy named Francis lgawa.
Why?

25:13.137 --> 25:15.423
There was a road atlas open
to Idaho Falls

25:15.640 --> 25:17.130
in Thorvin's office.

25:17.350 --> 25:18.305
Let's start there.

25:23.856 --> 25:27.269
When you were talking
to Francis Igawa's daughter,

25:27.485 --> 25:30.648
did she say that Thorvin Hampton
visited them in Idaho Falls?

25:30.863 --> 25:32.239
Yeah.

25:32.448 --> 25:33.733
She mention anything

25:33.950 --> 25:36.612
about what it was about
or how it went?

25:36.828 --> 25:38.113
Nope.

25:46.170 --> 25:49.333
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

25:50.550 --> 25:54.088
I thought I should wait
till we were alone first.

25:54.303 --> 25:55.679
Really? What?

25:57.015 --> 25:58.425
Well...

26:00.143 --> 26:01.098
The bat thing.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.596
What bat thing?

26:03.813 --> 26:05.428
[Walt]
At the Jacky place.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.314
You've been through a lot
lately.

26:09.527 --> 26:11.063
Trauma is...

26:11.279 --> 26:13.110
It's complex.

26:13.322 --> 26:16.450
If you, uh --
you need to talk

26:16.659 --> 26:18.900
about what's been, you know,
on your mind,

26:19.120 --> 26:21.953
I can, uh, you know...

26:23.833 --> 26:25.448
I can do that sort of thing.

26:25.668 --> 26:27.454
Do you know what's on my mind?

26:27.670 --> 26:29.752
We have access to the entire

26:29.922 --> 26:31.708
national fingerprint database
back at the office,

26:31.924 --> 26:33.960
yet you're still sitting there
with a magnifying glass

26:34.177 --> 26:35.542
trying to match
Nighthorse's prints

26:35.762 --> 26:37.423
to the ones you lifted
off of Branch's computer.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.344
If you don't want to talk to me,
that's fine,

26:39.557 --> 26:41.388
but there are professionals

26:41.601 --> 26:44.263
who, uh, specialize
in this sort of thing.

26:44.979 --> 26:48.187
Oh, so you're saying that
I shouldn't just rely on myself,

26:48.399 --> 26:52.062
that I should utilize
all available resources.

26:52.278 --> 26:55.486
The only reason
I'm not using a digital database

26:55.698 --> 26:57.199
is because I don't want
to sound alarms

26:57.408 --> 26:58.989
and attract
Nighthorse's attention.

26:59.202 --> 27:00.612
Right.

27:00.828 --> 27:02.784
Because Nighthorse
has successfully infiltrated

27:02.997 --> 27:04.703
and manipulated
the federal government

27:04.916 --> 27:07.703
on behalf of a secret
Native American agenda.

27:08.836 --> 27:09.871
I'm being cautious.

27:10.088 --> 27:12.295
No, you're being paranoid.

27:12.507 --> 27:13.667
We have Nighthorse's prints

27:13.883 --> 27:15.089
from the last time
we booked him.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.586
As soon as we get back
to the station,

27:16.803 --> 27:17.792
I'm gonna run them
through the database.

27:18.012 --> 27:18.876
Fine.

27:19.097 --> 27:20.678
Fine.

27:20.890 --> 27:23.302
Which is exactly howl feel,
by the way.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.102
Yeah.

27:26.521 --> 27:29.058
I remember Branch
saying something like that.

27:41.077 --> 27:42.988
293 Oak Street, Idaho Falls.

27:43.204 --> 27:45.866
Red door, pear tree.
This looks like the place.

27:46.082 --> 27:47.367
If this is Thorvin's
half-brother,

27:47.583 --> 27:49.084
he might also be his killer.

27:49.293 --> 27:50.908
We don't know
how he might react.

27:52.964 --> 27:54.295
I'll keep cover

27:54.507 --> 27:56.418
in case he decides
to flip out or flee.

27:57.426 --> 27:58.256
[knock on door]

28:10.231 --> 28:11.220
Mr. lgawa?

28:11.440 --> 28:12.520
I'm Sheriff Walt Longmire

28:12.733 --> 28:14.644
from Absaroka County in Wyoming.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.601
This is Deputy Moretti.

28:16.821 --> 28:18.527
You mind if we come in
and speak to you?

28:18.739 --> 28:20.275
Thank you. Yes.

28:20.491 --> 28:24.075
The sake is ready to be poured.

28:24.287 --> 28:25.697
Uh, thank you,

28:25.913 --> 28:28.370
but, urn, you don't
have to put yourself out.

28:31.669 --> 28:32.749
No.

28:35.631 --> 28:36.461
[door closes]

28:37.216 --> 28:39.081
[Francis shouting in Japanese]

28:39.302 --> 28:40.542
[clattering]

28:43.431 --> 28:45.217
Dad?

28:45.433 --> 28:47.014
You okay?
What's going on?

28:47.226 --> 28:48.261
Uh, Shiori?

28:48.477 --> 28:50.388
Hi.
Uh, uh, Deputy Moretti.

28:50.605 --> 28:51.936
We spoke on the phone.

28:52.148 --> 28:53.308
Oh, right.

28:53.524 --> 28:55.185
Sorry, I lost track of time.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.484
[clattering,
Francis shouting in Japanese]

28:58.696 --> 29:00.027
[sighs]

29:00.239 --> 29:03.151
I better check on my dad
before he hurts himself.

29:06.621 --> 29:08.577
Dad.

29:08.789 --> 29:11.622
No, I don't know where it's at.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.461
Here.

29:14.670 --> 29:15.625
Try this.

29:15.838 --> 29:18.545
Ah!
[speaking Japanese]

29:30.144 --> 29:32.760
Dad.
They didn't steal anything.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.141
I'm sure it's around here
somewhere.

29:38.903 --> 29:41.815
[speaking Japanese]

29:42.031 --> 29:44.647
It might be better
if we speak in my room.

29:45.618 --> 29:47.700
[shouting]

29:53.125 --> 29:55.332
[sighs]
Forgive the mess.

29:55.544 --> 29:58.707
I work graveyard as an ER nurse,

29:58.923 --> 30:03.132
and when I get home,
I pretty much collapse.

30:03.344 --> 30:06.507
Do you, uh, take care
of your father all by yourself?

30:06.722 --> 30:08.462
I try to.

30:08.683 --> 30:11.641
Well, we're sorry
for upsetting him.

30:11.852 --> 30:13.353
I should apologize.

30:13.562 --> 30:17.271
My father's been struggling
with dementia for years,

30:17.483 --> 30:19.223
and all of a sudden,
he thought you two

30:19.443 --> 30:21.900
were the neighborhood bullies
he grew up with.

30:22.113 --> 30:25.947
How did your father react
when Thorvin Hampton came here?

30:26.158 --> 30:30.367
Uh... polite and welcoming,
as always,

30:30.579 --> 30:32.194
but then when I stepped
into the kitchen

30:32.415 --> 30:34.576
for just, like, a moment,

30:34.792 --> 30:36.953
he started having
one of his fits.

30:37.169 --> 30:40.753
Sort of frightened
the War Eagle guy away.

30:40.965 --> 30:42.626
My father's mind
might be slipping,

30:42.842 --> 30:44.798
but he's still
as strong as a mule.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.551
Do you know what caused
the outburst?

30:47.763 --> 30:49.264
[Shiori]
It could've been anything.

30:49.473 --> 30:54.593
A childhood memory,
a bluebird flying by the window.

30:54.812 --> 30:56.313
You think your father
would react badly

30:56.522 --> 30:58.854
if Thorvin Hampton told him
they were half-brothers?

31:00.985 --> 31:02.441
Wait, what?

31:04.405 --> 31:06.817
I think you must be mistaken.

31:07.033 --> 31:10.821
This man just wanted to ask
for donations for his camp.

31:11.787 --> 31:15.371
Besides, he was white.

31:15.583 --> 31:17.323
Thorvin Hampton's father

31:17.543 --> 31:19.875
was a guard at War Eagle
during the war.

31:20.087 --> 31:21.748
Apparently,
this guard had an affair

31:21.964 --> 31:25.001
with a Japanese-American woman
at the camp,

31:25.217 --> 31:28.050
and then the woman
became pregnant

31:28.262 --> 31:31.220
with your father, we believe.

31:34.518 --> 31:36.679
What was this woman's name?

31:37.813 --> 31:39.144
Birdie.

31:40.649 --> 31:42.105
Oh.

31:46.322 --> 31:48.813
That explains so much.

31:49.033 --> 31:50.773
How so?

31:53.287 --> 31:54.868
My grandparents have always been

31:55.081 --> 31:58.244
an off-limits topic
for my father.

31:58.459 --> 32:01.701
I mean, he wouldn't even
stand for me to bring it up.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.458
Did this Mr. Hampton
send you here?

32:05.758 --> 32:07.214
No.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.508
Is he afraid to come back?

32:09.720 --> 32:11.585
No, uh, unfortunately,

32:11.847 --> 32:14.179
someone recently killed
Thorvin Hampton.

32:15.059 --> 32:19.598
It appears that your father
is his closest living kin.

32:19.814 --> 32:21.224
So, we drove out to notify him.

32:23.025 --> 32:24.265
Oh.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.897
Uh, well...

32:28.114 --> 32:30.025
I guess you could try
to do that,

32:30.241 --> 32:32.357
but I don't know
how much he'll understand.

32:36.539 --> 32:39.155
So, you did know Thorvin --
I mean Toe Tapper.

32:39.375 --> 32:41.240
[man] Everyone knows Toe Tapper,
hombre.

32:41.460 --> 32:44.327
Hell ofa stand-up guy.
Shame what happened.

32:45.089 --> 32:47.626
He ever mention anything
about any enemies?

32:47.842 --> 32:49.457
Anything about a half-brother?

32:49.677 --> 32:51.167
Sounds like
you need to get in touch

32:51.387 --> 32:53.799
with Sunshine Sally
over on channel 19.

32:54.014 --> 32:56.266
If there was anything haywire,
he would've told her.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.011
Yeah, I actually talked
with Sally Hoagland

32:58.227 --> 33:00.058
yesterday in person.

33:00.271 --> 33:02.978
Thought you said
you were out in Wyoming.

33:03.190 --> 33:04.691
I am. Why?

33:04.900 --> 33:07.061
Well, amigo,
Sally resides in Florida.

33:07.278 --> 33:10.190
You know, Sunshine State,
Sunshine Sally.

33:10.406 --> 33:12.692
You must've talked
to someone else.

33:12.908 --> 33:14.694
Is the Sunshine Sally
you're talking about

33:14.910 --> 33:16.775
really into turtles?

33:16.996 --> 33:19.487
Yeah.
She won't shut up about them.

33:19.707 --> 33:22.323
Yeah, she lives out here
in Absaroka County now.

33:22.543 --> 33:23.578
Lucky you, then.

33:23.794 --> 33:24.749
Sunshine Sally

33:24.962 --> 33:26.918
is a stone-cold smokin' fox.

33:29.925 --> 33:31.301
She is.

33:33.554 --> 33:35.260
[Ferg]
Sheriff, you there?

33:36.974 --> 33:37.804
What do you got?

33:38.392 --> 33:40.007
I just found a picture
of Sally Hoagland

33:40.227 --> 33:42.809
taped to Thorvin Hampton's desk.

33:43.022 --> 33:44.637
I think we need to reconsider
whether we want to believe

33:44.857 --> 33:46.813
a single thing
she's told us so far.

33:49.153 --> 33:50.438
[sighs]

33:56.827 --> 33:59.068
When did you move
to Absaroka county?

33:59.288 --> 34:00.619
[Sally]
About six weeks ago.

34:02.166 --> 34:03.451
We all lived

34:03.667 --> 34:05.203
in Coral Springs, Florida,
before that.

34:05.503 --> 34:08.540
Your fellow CBers seem to think
you still live in Florida.

34:08.714 --> 34:11.205
Well, you can't exactly control
what people think.

34:11.425 --> 34:13.211
-Can you?
-[Walt] No.

34:16.764 --> 34:19.096
But you can try.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.592
Did Thorvin even know
that you'd moved here?

34:23.812 --> 34:27.896
Or did he still think that you
were her living in Florida?

34:33.405 --> 34:36.442
Did you move here
to be closer to him?

34:36.659 --> 34:39.275
Was he angry
that you lied to him?

34:41.413 --> 34:42.744
[scoffs]

34:42.957 --> 34:44.618
He had no idea.

34:50.089 --> 34:54.002
I tried to approach him
a few weeks ago at a bar

34:54.218 --> 34:58.211
just to, you know, introduce
myself to him as the real me.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.682
We'd bonded so much
over the radio.

35:02.476 --> 35:06.765
But when I walked up to him,
it was like I wasn't even there.

35:08.107 --> 35:10.769
I was just some old heifer
in his eyes.

35:10.985 --> 35:13.818
He wouldn't give me
the time of day, so I left.

35:14.572 --> 35:18.781
And later that night,
we were back on the radio,

35:18.993 --> 35:21.075
talking into the night
like always

35:21.287 --> 35:22.868
because he thought
I looked like this.

35:26.166 --> 35:29.124
I moved out here thinking
that he was my soul mate.

35:31.964 --> 35:34.171
Turns out
he was just another guy.

35:34.383 --> 35:35.873
Did that make you angry?

35:36.093 --> 35:37.879
Of course it made me angry.

35:38.095 --> 35:39.835
But that doesn't mean
I killed him.

35:40.764 --> 35:43.631
I've never even been
up to that damn War Eagle.

35:44.393 --> 35:47.226
How'd you know that was
where we found Thorvin's body?

35:58.657 --> 36:00.613
[Vic] You mean you can't
get ahold of Walt, either?

36:00.826 --> 36:03.442
[Ruby] He's not picking up.
Maybe I should try Ferg.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.410
[sighs]

36:09.627 --> 36:12.835
You're not exactly talking
in code out here.

36:16.634 --> 36:19.250
[rock music playing]

36:22.640 --> 36:26.383
Hey, babe, let me get
four top-shelf tequilas.

36:26.602 --> 36:29.685
None of that usual
watered-down cat piss, okay?

36:29.897 --> 36:31.307
Put it on my tab.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.775
Under what name?
Prince Charming?

36:33.984 --> 36:35.770
[chuckles]
Lane Potter.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.230
And if you bring it to us

36:38.447 --> 36:40.062
with the right kind of smile
on your face,

36:40.282 --> 36:41.613
I'll make it worth your while.

37:03.764 --> 37:05.629
[Vic] I ran both sets of prints
through the database.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.510
First of all,
the prints you pulled

37:07.726 --> 37:10.718
from Branch's computer do not
belong to Jacob Nighthorse.

37:10.938 --> 37:12.144
They belong to Branch.

37:12.356 --> 37:13.721
Second of all, Jacob Nighthorse

37:13.899 --> 37:16.185
is not actually
Jacob Nighthorse.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.018
Then who is he?

37:19.238 --> 37:20.648
Jacob Harold Blankenship.

37:20.864 --> 37:23.071
And under that name in 1978,
he was arrested

37:23.283 --> 37:25.865
for assaulting
an FBI agent in Washington, D.C.

37:26.078 --> 37:29.320
I never got that on any
of the background checks I ran.

37:29.540 --> 37:30.871
That's because
under Jacob Nighthorse,

37:31.083 --> 37:32.414
his record is clean.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.618
What about his record
as Jacob Blankenship?

37:36.839 --> 37:39.000
Well, it turns out
that Jacob Blankenship

37:39.216 --> 37:42.253
is a part-time political radical
and a full-time pain in the ass.

37:42.469 --> 37:45.051
In the, urn, early '80s,

37:45.264 --> 37:46.595
he was pretty active in a group

37:46.849 --> 37:49.511
called
the American Indian Movement.

37:49.727 --> 37:51.513
[Walt]
Yeah. A.I.M.

37:51.729 --> 37:53.014
It's sort of like

37:53.230 --> 37:55.596
the Black Panthers for Indians,
so...

37:55.816 --> 37:58.728
Well, Nighthorse,
or Blankenship, whatever,

37:58.944 --> 38:00.445
he also had a partner in crime.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.649
His name was Dennis Wabash.
He died in 1983.

38:03.866 --> 38:06.448
Guess what Wabash's
cause of death was.

38:07.828 --> 38:09.659
-Gunshot wound?
-To the head.

38:09.872 --> 38:11.328
Self-inflicted.

38:11.540 --> 38:13.451
Presumably.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.908
So, what did you find out
about Sunshine Sally?

38:17.796 --> 38:23.883
False identities, bad histories,
toxic grudge.

38:24.094 --> 38:25.379
Uh...

38:26.722 --> 38:28.053
Sally Hoagland

38:28.265 --> 38:30.722
was misrepresenting herself
to Thorvin.

38:30.934 --> 38:32.515
She also moved here
without telling him,

38:32.728 --> 38:34.264
maybe to stalk him.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.220
She was tracking our activities
on a scanner,

38:36.440 --> 38:40.479
so she knew Thorvin was dead
well before Ferg talked to her.

38:40.694 --> 38:42.685
You think she's gonna make
a run for it?

38:42.905 --> 38:44.190
I got Ferg
camped out at her house,

38:44.406 --> 38:46.237
so if she tries, we'll know.

38:46.450 --> 38:48.065
Why don't you check
her background,

38:48.285 --> 38:50.321
see if she's got any
sort of record back in Florida?

38:50.537 --> 38:52.038
[Vic]
What about Jacob?

38:52.247 --> 38:53.987
Uh, I'll find out

38:54.208 --> 38:56.790
what he was involved in
in his Blankenship days.

38:57.002 --> 39:00.415
Extremists tend to be made,
not born.

39:00.631 --> 39:03.213

39:26.198 --> 39:27.313

-[knock on door]
-Hey, shit bird,

39:37.835 --> 39:40.121
if you need to go that bad,
use the sink.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.925
Shit.

39:53.141 --> 39:55.553
Hey, man, what do you want?

39:56.478 --> 39:58.890
Listen,
I'm sure whoever sent you,

39:59.064 --> 40:00.804
it was just a misunderstanding.

40:04.945 --> 40:06.355
[door closes]

40:13.036 --> 40:14.367
Oh, shit.

40:22.254 --> 40:23.664
[door closes]

40:26.341 --> 40:29.458
Find anything from Florida
on Sally Hoagland?

40:29.678 --> 40:31.293
Not yet.

40:31.513 --> 40:32.593
What are you doing?

40:32.806 --> 40:33.966
Are you searching
Branch's computer

40:34.182 --> 40:35.262
for prints again?

40:35.475 --> 40:37.306
I'm searching.

40:42.691 --> 40:44.397
-[Rett] Come on, move it.
-[Walt] Mr. Jacky.

40:44.610 --> 40:45.770
Can we help you?

40:45.986 --> 40:47.692
-What?
-Here.

40:48.572 --> 40:50.028
-Dad.
-Get in there.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.571
What?

40:54.077 --> 40:55.237
[groans]

40:55.454 --> 40:57.740
I would like to apologize,
Sheriff.

40:57.956 --> 41:01.164
I thought I had raised my son
to tell the truth.

41:01.376 --> 41:02.957
But I was wrong.

41:03.170 --> 41:05.877
He did steal money from
that camp's damn donation box.

41:06.089 --> 41:08.375
And don't ask me
where he thought this idea

41:08.592 --> 41:09.877
was acceptable behavior.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.126
If I recall,
you're not exactly a fan

41:12.346 --> 41:13.961
of Thorvin's plans
for War Eagle.

41:14.181 --> 41:16.422
Oh, I do have issues
with them reopening that camp.

41:16.642 --> 41:20.009
But my son stole
and vandalized private property.

41:20.812 --> 41:23.303
Now we know he's a thief
and a liar.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.354
I'm just praying to God
he's not a killer, too.

41:25.567 --> 41:27.398
[grunts]
Damn it, Dad, I told you not --

41:27.611 --> 41:30.023
I didn't see anyone up there.
I didn't see anyone up there.

41:30.238 --> 41:31.694
[Rett]
Maybe you did, maybe you didn't.

41:31.907 --> 41:33.943
But that's the problem
with being a liar, son.

41:34.159 --> 41:36.696
People can't believe you
either way.

41:36.912 --> 41:40.370
Sheriff,
whatever my boy has done,

41:40.582 --> 41:43.574
I want him to suffer the full
consequences for his actions.

41:45.462 --> 41:46.998
I just thank God
his grandfather's

41:47.214 --> 41:49.205
not alive to see this.

41:49.424 --> 41:52.257
Jumping around
in his goddamn underwear.

41:55.222 --> 41:56.837
[Walt]
How much did he take?

41:57.057 --> 41:59.514
Uh, $87.

42:01.186 --> 42:03.677
And one historical artifact.

42:12.447 --> 42:14.563
I got the impression
that Francis lgawa

42:14.783 --> 42:16.739
was looking for a lighter
in his kitchen.

42:16.952 --> 42:18.908
So did I.

42:19.121 --> 42:20.031
Any idea what it says?

42:20.247 --> 42:22.329
Japanese? No.

42:22.541 --> 42:24.202
I don't know any Japanese.

42:24.418 --> 42:25.749
Do you?

42:25.961 --> 42:27.292
No.

42:27.504 --> 42:30.621
But I did go out to sushi
a few weeks ago.

42:30.841 --> 42:32.251
Cool little mom-and-pop place

42:32.467 --> 42:35.083
that operates
out of an old gas station.

42:35.303 --> 42:38.431
The menu's entirely in Japanese.

42:38.640 --> 42:40.050
-What are you doing?
-I had to download this app

42:41.226 --> 42:42.762
to be able to read
the sushi menu.

42:42.978 --> 42:46.266
It translates images into text.
Technology, right?

42:46.481 --> 42:48.437
In the meantime,
we could use this opportunity

42:48.650 --> 42:51.813
to talk about my feelings
regarding my past trauma.

42:57.409 --> 42:58.194
-Uh --
-[ding]

42:58.952 --> 43:01.034
Oh, look.
It's done translating.

43:01.246 --> 43:02.782
Good.

43:02.998 --> 43:04.454
Saved by the bell.

43:04.666 --> 43:06.406
[clears throat]

43:06.626 --> 43:10.915
"If this is my corpse,
bring the little birds

43:11.131 --> 43:13.463
so it's admitted
I said the name.

43:13.675 --> 43:18.044
Private J. lgawa."

43:18.263 --> 43:20.504
That is a huge coincidence

43:20.724 --> 43:24.012
that the Jacky kid just happened
to find this lighter

43:24.227 --> 43:25.842
after it's been sitting
up at War Eagle

43:26.063 --> 43:27.769
for the last 70 years.

43:27.981 --> 43:32.315
Or maybe Francis lgawa
left it there a couple days ago.

43:32.527 --> 43:34.392
[Vic]
We've seen him.

43:34.613 --> 43:35.978
No offense, but Mr. lgawa

43:36.198 --> 43:38.439
doesn't even know
what planet he's on.

43:38.658 --> 43:40.034
Unless, of course,
you think that he understands

43:40.285 --> 43:42.401
more than he's letting on.

43:42.621 --> 43:45.158
He understood
that his lighter was missing.

43:48.085 --> 43:49.495
[sighs]

43:51.880 --> 43:55.088
This is Sheriff Walt Longmire
from Absaroka County.

43:55.300 --> 43:56.756
Your father was upset

43:56.968 --> 44:00.005
about losing something
when we visited you.

44:00.222 --> 44:01.462
Was it a lighter?

44:01.681 --> 44:03.137
[Shiori]
I think that's what it was.

44:03.350 --> 44:04.760
Why?

44:04.976 --> 44:06.841
I think we found it.

44:07.604 --> 44:10.471
Does your father
ever get out of the house?

44:10.690 --> 44:12.226
Sometimes.

44:12.442 --> 44:13.978
I change the locks
and try to hide the keys,

44:14.194 --> 44:15.809
but he always seems
to find a way out.

44:15.987 --> 44:17.318
Dad.

44:17.531 --> 44:19.692
Does he ever
get out to your car?

44:19.908 --> 44:23.150
I'm doing the best I can.

44:23.370 --> 44:27.704
I'm sure you are,
but, uh, there's a problem.

44:27.916 --> 44:29.747
Soon after your half-uncle,
Thorvin Hampton,

44:29.960 --> 44:33.873
came to visit your father,
Mr. Hampton was murdered.

44:34.881 --> 44:37.964
Then we found your father's
lighter at the scene.

44:38.176 --> 44:42.135
Sheriff, what are you saying?

44:42.347 --> 44:44.303
I'd like to help your father

44:44.516 --> 44:48.805
live out his days in a facility
rather than a prison.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.147
Now, if you bring him
up to War Eagle,

44:51.398 --> 44:53.389
I may be able
to help him do that.

45:05.162 --> 45:08.700
Kind of tucked this place away,
didn't they?

45:08.915 --> 45:10.746
Out of sight, out of mind.

45:15.172 --> 45:16.662
Is this your father's?

45:19.217 --> 45:21.208
Grandfather's, actually.

45:22.846 --> 45:25.178
He took it with him
when he fought in World War II.

45:26.766 --> 45:29.382
"You found my body,
deliver this to Birdie

45:29.603 --> 45:32.345
so she knows I died
while singing her name.

45:33.773 --> 45:35.638
Private J. lgawa."

45:35.859 --> 45:38.771
My grandfather
was James Franklin lgawa.

45:40.030 --> 45:41.361
He and my Grandma Birdie

45:41.573 --> 45:43.404
were married
for just about three weeks

45:43.617 --> 45:45.858
when they were forced
to come here.

45:46.620 --> 45:48.076
Six months after that,

45:48.288 --> 45:50.404
Grandpa James was drafted
by the U.S. Army

45:50.624 --> 45:52.615
to fight overseas.

45:52.834 --> 45:54.950
[Walt]
Did your father tell you that?

45:55.170 --> 45:57.286
No.

45:57.505 --> 46:00.963
I put it together through family
friends and public records.

46:01.176 --> 46:04.589
I had to pull a couple of double
shifts at work this week.

46:04.804 --> 46:06.931
Think he made his way out here?

46:07.140 --> 46:10.803
Well, I think so.

46:11.770 --> 46:14.557
Let's see if we can, uh,
walk our way through this.

46:15.815 --> 46:18.807
If your father
didn't mean to kill Thorvin,

46:19.027 --> 46:20.813
that would really help his case.

46:36.962 --> 46:39.499
Does your father
have a history of violence?

46:39.714 --> 46:44.879
He's always had anger issues,
even before his dementia.

46:47.180 --> 46:51.139
He believed his belt
was the best way

46:51.351 --> 46:55.344
to teach me how to be a good,
obedient Japanese daughter.

46:56.856 --> 46:58.141
That sounds hard.

46:58.358 --> 47:00.690
Is this where it happened?

47:00.902 --> 47:02.813
No.

47:03.029 --> 47:06.192
Thorvin Hampton's body
was found right down here.

47:26.011 --> 47:28.423
You have any trouble
finding this place?

47:29.681 --> 47:30.761
Not really.

47:30.974 --> 47:33.215
I just followed the signs.

47:35.729 --> 47:37.435
You mean these signs.

47:40.025 --> 47:42.437
I took them all down
earlier today,

47:42.652 --> 47:46.440
but, uh, you remembered
how to get here anyway

47:46.656 --> 47:47.816
because you've been here before

47:48.033 --> 47:52.618
in this room
with your half-uncle.

47:57.584 --> 48:00.747
Are you gonna lock me in here
like you did Thorvin Hampton?

48:02.422 --> 48:07.257
You never thought it was my dad,
did you?

48:07.469 --> 48:09.300
I considered it.

48:09.512 --> 48:13.300
But what seemed much more likely
was that you drove out here,

48:13.516 --> 48:17.100
brought your father
because he couldn't be alone.

48:17.312 --> 48:22.602
You lured me out here
under false pretenses

48:22.817 --> 48:25.604
just so you could lock me up.

48:27.197 --> 48:29.813
I guess some things
never change.

48:32.535 --> 48:33.786
Shiori.

48:33.995 --> 48:35.155
Did you lock Thorvin in here?

48:35.372 --> 48:37.237
What else should I have done?

48:38.208 --> 48:40.369
Given him a donation?

48:40.585 --> 48:43.543
That man's father
ruined my family.

48:43.755 --> 48:46.667
My grandmother killed herself
out of shame,

48:46.883 --> 48:48.965
and now he wanted
to make a museum out of it

48:49.177 --> 48:51.213
so he could feel better
about himself.

48:51.429 --> 48:52.760
Maybe I should've given him
a picture

48:52.931 --> 48:54.546
of Grandma Birdie's headstone

48:54.766 --> 48:56.131
so he could stick it
on a T-shirt

48:56.351 --> 48:58.182
and sell it as a souvenir.

48:58.395 --> 49:03.059
Well, Thorvin Hampton's father
may have destroyed your family,

49:03.274 --> 49:05.014
but Thorvin
didn't do anything wrong.

49:05.235 --> 49:06.725
[Shiori]
Guess what.

49:06.945 --> 49:09.527
These people didn't
do anything wrong, either.

49:11.116 --> 49:14.279
They were just trying
to live their lives,

49:14.494 --> 49:17.156
just like I was trying
to live my life

49:17.372 --> 49:19.363
and take care of my father.

49:19.582 --> 49:22.540
And now Thorvin Hampton
barges in,

49:22.752 --> 49:25.619
announces that he's my dad's
long-lost half-brother,

49:25.839 --> 49:27.875
and leaves me
to deal with the damage.

49:28.091 --> 49:30.252
Did you come here
to get revenge for that?

49:33.555 --> 49:38.390
He invited us to visit,
for closure, he said.

49:39.602 --> 49:42.309
So, after a couple of days
of dealing with my father,

49:42.522 --> 49:44.558
I took him up on the offer.

49:45.483 --> 49:47.940
God knows I needed something.

49:49.154 --> 49:51.861
So, l-I drove us out here.

49:53.241 --> 49:55.277
-[sighs]
-[Walt] Did your father know

49:55.493 --> 49:56.824
where you were going?

49:57.662 --> 49:59.368
[Shiori]
Who knows?

49:59.581 --> 50:01.742
Yelled the whole way and refused
to get out of the car

50:01.958 --> 50:03.289
once we got here.

50:04.711 --> 50:10.047
So, I talked to this Thorvin guy
by myself.

50:10.258 --> 50:13.250
And he was so...

50:15.013 --> 50:16.969
...proud of himself,

50:17.182 --> 50:22.176
of his courage to put
this shit hole back together.

50:22.937 --> 50:28.682
He had no idea what this place
had done to my family,

50:28.902 --> 50:30.438
to me.

50:31.404 --> 50:34.020
So, he leads me in here
and shows me all this stuff

50:34.240 --> 50:37.824
and says, "I can only imagine
what it was like."

50:38.953 --> 50:41.160
And I thought, "You know,

50:41.372 --> 50:44.739
I can show you
exactly what it was like."

50:45.460 --> 50:47.416
So then you locked Thorvin
in here.

50:47.629 --> 50:50.541
Just like the government did
to us.

50:50.757 --> 50:52.088
And you just left.

50:52.383 --> 50:54.374
Well, first I had to track down
my father,

50:54.594 --> 50:56.334
who was off wandering
into some field,

50:56.554 --> 50:57.794
dropping his lighter,
apparently,

50:58.014 --> 51:00.551
but then, yeah.

51:01.559 --> 51:05.723
Yeah, l-l left
and pretended it never happened.

51:05.939 --> 51:07.019
Why?

51:07.232 --> 51:09.769
Because I'm an American.

51:09.984 --> 51:11.724
I don't like to live
in the past.

51:18.284 --> 51:20.115
[Walt]
That's true of a lot of people.

51:22.956 --> 51:24.662
But not Thorvin.

51:31.089 --> 51:32.750
[handcuffs clicking]

51:48.106 --> 51:50.222
[chuckles]

51:50.441 --> 51:53.433
It's so beautiful here.

51:58.157 --> 52:00.318
[man] You know, I never even
met the guy face-to-face.

52:00.535 --> 52:02.241
He was just a voice
on the radio.

52:02.954 --> 52:05.411
He was as good an amigo
as I ever had.

52:05.623 --> 52:06.908
[Sally] Maybe folks
should get together

52:07.125 --> 52:09.116
and have some drinks
in his honor.

52:09.335 --> 52:10.199
[man #2]
Who y'all talking about?

52:10.420 --> 52:11.284
Someone die?

52:11.462 --> 52:12.963
[man #1]
Toe Tapper.

52:13.131 --> 52:14.541
[Sally]
Thorvin Hampton.

52:14.757 --> 52:16.338
[man #2]
Oh, man, not Thorvin.

52:16.551 --> 52:18.382
They don't make them
like that anymore.

52:33.192 --> 52:34.648
Jess.
Where's Henry?

52:34.819 --> 52:36.480
Men's room cleaning up.

52:42.410 --> 52:43.900
Hooligans have been
writing graffiti

52:44.120 --> 52:45.576
on the mirror
in permanent marker.

52:45.788 --> 52:47.653
I got Ruby's note,
said you'd heard back

52:47.874 --> 52:49.910
from your contact
at the university.

52:50.126 --> 52:51.366
ldid.

52:51.586 --> 52:52.792
My friend identified the pollen

52:53.004 --> 52:54.585
in Branch's shotgun shell.

52:54.797 --> 52:57.049
It comes from
arrowleaf balsamroot,

52:57.258 --> 52:58.839
a common wildflower.

52:59.052 --> 52:59.962
Yeah.

53:00.178 --> 53:01.839
Grows out by my cabin.

53:02.055 --> 53:03.886
Just about everywhere else.

53:05.892 --> 53:07.257
[sighs]

53:10.855 --> 53:16.145
Although, Martha tried
to put some in pots one time.

53:16.361 --> 53:19.444
She overwatered the seedlings,
and they died.

53:19.656 --> 53:21.897
My friend did mention
that arrowleaf balsamroot

53:22.116 --> 53:25.074
is notoriously intolerant
of watery soils.

53:25.286 --> 53:28.744
Which means Branch was not shot
anywhere near the creek bed.

53:28.956 --> 53:30.332
The entire scene was staged.

53:30.541 --> 53:33.248
The evidence suggests
that that is correct.

53:33.461 --> 53:37.124
Our next step is to find
the actual crime scene.

53:38.132 --> 53:43.172
Now, if you want to step away
from this, I'll understand.

53:44.180 --> 53:46.842
I have never been one
to back down from a fight.

53:47.058 --> 53:48.423
[Walt]
Good.

53:48.643 --> 53:50.053
Me either.
