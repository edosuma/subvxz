WEBVTT

00:06.707 --> 00:08.238
PREVIOUSLY ON
"MELISSA & JOEY"...

00:08.239 --> 00:10.009
Joe: MY GRANDMOTHER
SOFIA IS FAILING

00:10.010 --> 00:12.082
AND ALL SHE WANTS IS TO SEE
ME AND TIFFANY TOGETHER.

00:12.083 --> 00:14.013
WHY DOES SHE WANT TO
SEE YOUR EX-WIFE?

00:14.014 --> 00:15.445
I NEVER TOLD HER THAT
WE GOT DIVORCED.

00:15.446 --> 00:17.087
OF COURSE I'M COMING, NONA!

00:17.088 --> 00:18.648
YOU... YOU'RE CHECKING...

00:18.649 --> 00:21.751
IT'S REALLY YOU! HI, TIFFANY!

00:21.752 --> 00:24.794
I NEED YOU TO KILL A RAT.

00:24.795 --> 00:26.096
YOU MEAN MURDER?

00:26.097 --> 00:28.098
I KNOW WHERE SHE OUGHTA
PUT HER TWO LIPS.

00:28.099 --> 00:29.799
- RIGHT HERE.
- LEAVE ME ALONE.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.432
THAT SOUNDED PRETTY
CLEAR TO ME, FELLAS.

00:35.206 --> 00:38.368
- WHAT IS THIS?
- THE RABBIT'S BREW HAS PRODUCED

00:38.369 --> 00:40.710
17 MARRIAGES AND 80 CHILDREN.

00:40.711 --> 00:42.813
IT'S A LOVE POTION.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.747
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:47.748 --> 00:51.751
- ( coughs )
- NONA. DUDE.

00:51.752 --> 00:55.054
THAT WAS THE BEST
99th BIRTHDAY PARTY

00:55.055 --> 00:57.427
I'VE EVER BEEN TO.

00:57.428 --> 01:02.192
THE BEST PART IS SEEING THE
FLAME OF LOVE GLOW AGAIN

01:02.193 --> 01:06.196
- BETWEEN MY JOEY AND HIS TIFFANY.
- ( chuckles )

01:06.197 --> 01:09.739
THAT'S WHO WE ARE,
ESPECIALLY ME.

01:09.740 --> 01:12.472
( laughs ) DON'T OVERSELL,
TIFFANY, ALL RIGHT?

01:12.473 --> 01:15.475
- I CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE, NONA.
- I BET YOU CAN.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.646
( both chuckle )

01:16.647 --> 01:18.748
I LEFT YOU A LITTLE NIGHTCAP...

01:18.749 --> 01:20.750
THE RABBIT'S BREW.

01:20.751 --> 01:23.254
WELL, HOP TO IT.

01:24.655 --> 01:26.786
ISN'T SHE ADORABLE?

01:26.787 --> 01:30.160
I MEAN, YOU HAVE AN
ADORABLE GRANDMOTHER.

01:30.161 --> 01:31.621
YOU KNOW, I JUST WANNA...
I JUST WANNA

01:31.622 --> 01:33.223
PUT HER IN MY PURSE AND
TAKE HER HOME WITH ME.

01:33.224 --> 01:34.824
AND THEN WHEN I GO
OUT WITH MY FRIENDS,

01:34.825 --> 01:37.468
I CAN TAKE HER OUT AND
SAY, "NONA IN YOUR FACE!"

01:40.431 --> 01:42.802
WHOA WHOA, MEL, NO WAY. I'M
ALREADY WAY OVER MY LIMIT.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.274
- I'M JUST HAPPY THEY DIDN'T HAVE A SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT...
- ( sloshes )

01:44.275 --> 01:47.237
- ...AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS.
- ( laughs )

01:47.238 --> 01:49.339
YOU ARE SO FUNNY, JOE.

01:49.340 --> 01:50.640
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
TELL YOU THAT ENOUGH,

01:50.641 --> 01:52.382
SO LET ME TELL YOU AGAIN.

01:52.383 --> 01:53.743
- OKAY.
- YOU...

01:53.744 --> 01:56.716
- YEAH?
- ...ARE SO FUNNY...

01:56.717 --> 01:58.548
JOE.

01:58.549 --> 02:00.490
( both laugh )

02:00.491 --> 02:02.752
HEY, MEL, MEL, LISTEN TO ME.

02:02.753 --> 02:04.424
LISTEN, I'MA TELL YOU SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT, ALL RIGHT?

02:04.425 --> 02:07.257
I WANT YOU TO PUT DOWN THE
BED AND GET TO DRINK, OKAY?

02:07.258 --> 02:09.299
- ( mutters )
- HERE'S WHAT I MEANT.

02:09.300 --> 02:12.862
I MEANT PUT DOWN THE BED AND
GET TO DRINK, ALL RIGHT?

02:12.863 --> 02:14.664

- I DID NAIL IT.

02:14.665 --> 02:16.406
TELL YOU WHAT I'MA DO.
I'M GONNA GO BUNK

02:16.407 --> 02:17.707

02:17.708 --> 02:19.309
- OKAY. NIGHT.
- NIGHT.

02:19.310 --> 02:21.312
( rattles )

02:22.573 --> 02:24.674
THIS DOOR'S LOCKED.

02:24.675 --> 02:27.146
WHY-WHY-WHY... WHY
IS THIS DOOR LOCKED?

02:27.147 --> 02:30.650
YOUR GRANDMOTHER LOCKED US IN!

02:30.651 --> 02:32.882
OH, YOU KNOW WHY?

02:32.883 --> 02:35.425
'CAUSE SHE WANTS US TO SPEND
THE NIGHT TOGETHER TONIGHT,

02:35.426 --> 02:38.928
- LIKE WABBITS.
- ( both laughing )

02:38.929 --> 02:42.662

CAN'T KILL A MAN.

04:27.938 --> 04:29.469
I'M SORRY, I JUST CAN'T.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.871
A MAN? I WANT YOU TO KILL A RAT!

04:31.872 --> 04:33.473
YOU KNOW... ( mimics rat )

04:33.474 --> 04:36.706
WHEN YOU SAID A RAT, I
THOUGHT YOU MEANT A WISEGUY

04:36.707 --> 04:37.747
WHO SANG TO THE COPS.

04:37.748 --> 04:39.950
WHAT ARE YOU, IN A
SCORSESE MOVIE?

04:40.951 --> 04:42.752
NOW LOOK, WHEN YOU SEE THE RAT,

04:42.753 --> 04:45.285
TWO TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD...
BAM BAM.

I KNOW YOU WON'T LET ME DOWN.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.792

04:58.369 --> 05:00.371

05:03.704 --> 05:05.675
SO, MISS OHIO,

05:05.676 --> 05:07.877
GOTTA SAY I REALLY ENJOYED
BEING WITH YOU TONIGHT.

05:07.878 --> 05:10.780
ME TOO, BUT YOU DO REMEMBER
THAT I'M LEAVING TOMORROW,

05:10.781 --> 05:13.584
- SO YOU AND I CAN'T...
- LET US NOT SPEAK OF TOMORROW.

05:18.789 --> 05:20.019
( chuckles )

05:20.020 --> 05:21.821
- ( switch clicks )
- ( gasps )

05:21.822 --> 05:23.793
HEY THERE.

05:23.794 --> 05:25.656
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT YOURSELF A...

05:26.657 --> 05:27.798
SITUATION.

05:28.859 --> 05:30.700
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE HE'S
UP TO YOUR USUAL...

05:30.701 --> 05:32.702
INTELLECTUAL STANDARDS, THOUGH.

05:32.703 --> 05:35.835
I KNOW. IT'S SO RELAXING.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.837
IT'S A GOOD THING YOU
AND ZANDER ARE ON A...

05:37.838 --> 05:40.009
- WHAT'D YOU CALL IT AGAIN?
- A PAUSE!

05:40.010 --> 05:41.841
- A PAUSE, YEAH.
- IT'S A REAL THING.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.013
TAYLOR SWIFT DOES
IT ALL THE TIME.

05:58.859 --> 05:59.890
OH BOY.

06:08.439 --> 06:10.770
( whispers ) GO BACK TO SLEEP.
BACK TO SLEEP.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.543
BACK TO SLEEP. ( chuckles )

06:13.544 --> 06:16.145
( moans ) GOOD MORNING, JOE.

06:16.146 --> 06:17.908
MORNING THERE, MEL.

06:19.510 --> 06:22.612
- ( thuds )
- OH, I HAD THE STRANGEST DREAM.

06:22.613 --> 06:25.815
I DON'T EVEN WANNA TELL YOU ABOUT IT.
IT'S TOO INAPPROPRIATE.

06:25.816 --> 06:27.588
MIGHT'VE HAD THE SAME DREAM.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.891
WAIT. WHOA.

06:32.062 --> 06:33.724
YOU AND I?!

06:34.825 --> 06:36.896
YEAH, YOU AND I.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.128
THE WHOLE THING?!

06:39.129 --> 06:42.002
LIKE FROM... FROM THE
EARTH TO THE MOON?

06:43.534 --> 06:44.775
ALL THE WAY.

06:45.736 --> 06:47.808
THE EAGLE'S LANDED.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.781
WE HAVE TO MAKE A PACT, OKAY?

06:51.782 --> 06:54.413
WHAT... WHAT HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT DIES WITH US.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.886
OKAY, NOBODY CAN EVER FIND OUT.

06:56.887 --> 06:59.118
- JOEY, BREAKFAST!
- OH MY GOD. ( gasps )

06:59.119 --> 07:01.751
WHOA.

07:01.752 --> 07:04.855
MOM! AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
YOU STILL DON'T KNOCK FIRST?!

07:06.757 --> 07:09.799
MEL BURKE, WHEN YOU
COMMIT TO A PART,

07:09.800 --> 07:11.761
YOU GO ALL THE WAY!

07:11.762 --> 07:13.533
NO, IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.834
IT NEVER IS.

07:14.835 --> 07:18.138
BUT DON'T WORRY. NO
ONE WILL KNOW BUT ME.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.842
( slams, locks )

07:22.843 --> 07:24.914
WHAT THE HELL?!

07:24.915 --> 07:26.817
THEY DID IT.

07:28.519 --> 07:29.920
SHE SAW NOTHING.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.786
SO I CORNERED THE
LITTLE GUY, LIKE A RAT.

07:36.787 --> 07:38.559
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
THEY SAY THAT.

07:39.990 --> 07:42.061
BUT IN THE END, IT WAS
EITHER ME OR HIM.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.894
I HAD THE SHOVEL.

07:44.895 --> 07:47.466
EXTRA PEPPERS AND
EGGS FOR THIS ONE.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.470
MY BOY BECAME A MAN LAST NIGHT.

07:52.543 --> 07:54.804
JOEY IS VERY QUIET THIS MORNING.

07:54.805 --> 07:57.978
MAYBE HE DIDN'T GET
SO MUCH SLEEP.

08:00.050 --> 08:03.482
GOOD MORNING, NONA.
( mimics kissing )

08:03.483 --> 08:06.916
GLORIA, SO GOOD TO SEE YOU
TODAY FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.

08:06.917 --> 08:10.621
- JOEJOEBEE.
- TIFFYPOP.

08:12.523 --> 08:15.926
HEY, HOW ABOUT LAST NIGHT? DID
YOU HEAR THOSE TWO GOING AT IT?

08:16.967 --> 08:18.829
LIKE HUMAN JACKHAMMERS.

08:20.971 --> 08:22.972
I THOUGHT IT'D NEVER STOP.

08:22.973 --> 08:24.503
( whispering ) WHY'D YOU
HAVE TO BE SO LOUD, HUH?

08:24.504 --> 08:25.876
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO BE SO GOOD?

08:26.937 --> 08:29.809
THE WHOLE HOUSE SHOOK.
BANG BANG BANG.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.781
WE GET IT. WE GET IT.
( chuckles )

08:31.782 --> 08:33.783
WHAT? WAS I THE ONLY
ONE THAT HEARD IT?

08:33.784 --> 08:35.184
THE PASCARELLI BROTHERS
GOT INTO A FISTFIGHT

08:35.185 --> 08:36.986
AND KNOCKED OVER ALL
THE TRASH CANS.

08:36.987 --> 08:40.620
OH! TRASH CANS. RIGHT, YEAH.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.251
BANG BANG.

08:42.252 --> 08:44.894
- YEAH, WHAT'D YOU THINK?
- NOTHING.

08:44.895 --> 08:46.926
NOBODY SHOULD THINK ANYTHING.
PEOPLE SHOULD JUST EAT.

08:46.927 --> 08:51.131
ALL RIGHT? AND APPRECIATE
HOW GREAT LAST NIGHT WAS.

08:52.202 --> 08:53.864
NONA'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

08:55.205 --> 08:57.667
YUP, 'CAUSE THAT'S THE
ONLY THING THAT HAPPENED.

08:57.668 --> 08:59.139
- ( Joey chuckles )
- ALL NIGHT.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.142
( laughs )

09:04.615 --> 09:07.847
HEY, VINNIE, THAT WAS A HELL
OF A PARTY LAST NIGHT, RIGHT?

09:07.848 --> 09:11.751
- SAL, WASSUP? HOW YOU DOIN'?
- STOP PLAYING WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.624
THERE ARE BIGGER THINGS GOING
ON RIGHT NOW. COME ON.

09:14.925 --> 09:17.326
LAST NIGHT, AUNT MEL SLEPT
OVER IN JOE'S ROOM,

09:17.327 --> 09:19.929
AND I MEAN LIKE
REALLY SLEPT OVER.

09:19.930 --> 09:22.862
COME ON, THAT MAKES NO SENSE.
THEY'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING.

09:22.863 --> 09:26.095
WELL, YEAH, BUT SOMETIMES
FIGHTING IS A KIND OF ATTRACTION.

09:26.096 --> 09:28.037
HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON

09:28.038 --> 09:30.300
BETWEEN JOE AND AUNT MEL
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS?

09:31.672 --> 09:34.243
- NO.
- WE'VE BEEN LIVING IN A HOUSE

09:34.244 --> 09:36.846
PERMEATED BY SEXUAL
TENSION AND FRUSTRATION.

09:36.847 --> 09:39.209
I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST ME.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.854
HEY, MEL, LOOK, WE HAVE SOME
IMPORTANT THINGS TO TALK ABOUT.

09:44.855 --> 09:46.886
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.958
I WAS THINKING IF WE
LEAVE BEFORE 3:00 P.M.,

09:48.959 --> 09:51.891
WE CAN MISS ALL THE SUNDAY
AFTERNOON TRAFFIC ON THE TURNPIKE.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.893
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT?
TURNPIKE TRAFFIC?

09:53.894 --> 09:56.065
WHAT ABOUT YOU AND ME, WHAT
HAPPENED IN HERE LAST NIGHT?

09:56.066 --> 09:58.268
YOU KNOW, FROM THE
EARTH TO THE MOON.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.170
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WAS
THINKING ABOUT THAT, TOO.

10:01.171 --> 10:04.905
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
WE WEREN'T EVEN THERE.

10:07.137 --> 10:08.839
OH, YOU WERE THERE.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.842
I MEAN, I WAS THERE, TOO.
( chuckles )

10:12.843 --> 10:15.044
I... I WAS JUST A LITTLE HIGHER.

10:15.045 --> 10:18.047
NO NO NO NO NO. YOU
AND I WERE NOT THERE.

10:18.048 --> 10:20.249
JOEJOEBEE AND
TIFFANY WERE THERE.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.221
- MEL, PLEASE WILL YOU STOP...
- NO, TIFFANY.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.824
I HAVE TO BE TIFFANY AND FOOL YOUR
GRANDMOTHER FOR TWO MORE HOURS.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.156
HEY, JOEY... AND TIFFANY,

10:27.157 --> 10:29.628
NONA WANTS TO SEE EVERYONE
IN THE LIVING ROOM...

10:29.629 --> 10:31.030
AN ANNOUNCEMENT OR SOMETHING.
YOU GUYS BUSY?

10:31.031 --> 10:32.261
ACTUALLY, WE WERE RIGHT IN THE
MIDDLE OF TALKING ABOUT...

10:32.262 --> 10:33.903
NOT AT ALL! HERE COMES TIFFANY!

10:33.904 --> 10:36.006
TRAMP, SLUT, TRAMP,
SLUT, TRAMP, SLUT...

10:38.068 --> 10:40.910
AS WONDERFUL AS THAT
BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS,

10:40.911 --> 10:42.641
IT WAS PROBABLY MY LAST.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.015
- ( all murmur disagreement )
- NO NO NO NO NO, ONE DAY SOON

10:46.016 --> 10:48.117
I'LL BE LAID OUT
HERE IN THIS PARLOR

10:48.118 --> 10:49.979
WITH NICE MAKEUP ON.

10:49.980 --> 10:53.252
NOT TOO MUCH, GLORIA. I
DON'T WANT TO LOOK CHEAP.

10:53.253 --> 10:56.085
NOW I WANNA TELL YOU

10:56.086 --> 10:59.059
WHAT I'M LEAVING
EACH OF YOU, OKAY?

11:00.931 --> 11:04.894
FIRST OF ALL, TO MY HANDSOME
GREAT-GRANDSON MARCO,

11:04.895 --> 11:06.966
MY LATE HUSBAND
ALFREDO'S COLLECTION

11:06.967 --> 11:10.800
OF RISQUE PLAYING CARDS.

11:10.801 --> 11:14.904
AND... I'VE NEVER REVEALED
THIS TO ANYONE...

11:14.905 --> 11:17.306
I AM THE QUEEN OF HEARTS.

11:17.307 --> 11:18.408
( murmur )

11:19.409 --> 11:22.753
NONA... NOT BAD.

11:23.914 --> 11:25.716
MORE LIKE THE QUEEN
OF HEARTBREAKERS.

11:26.957 --> 11:30.990
AND FOR MY GRANDNIECE ROSALIE...

11:30.991 --> 11:33.292
SO THAT'S WHY I DON'T WANT YOU

11:33.293 --> 11:35.324
TO BE PLANNING THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE AROUND ME.

11:35.325 --> 11:38.868
WE COME FROM TWO DIFFERENT
WORLDS AND I'M LEAVING TODAY,

11:38.869 --> 11:42.031
SO JUST DON'T FALL
IN LOVE WITH ME.

11:42.032 --> 11:44.234
HELLO. COULD YOU LOOK THIS WAY?

11:45.305 --> 11:48.137
GOT IT, GOT IT. NO FUTURE HERE.

11:48.138 --> 11:50.980
BUT LISTEN, COULD YOU
GIVE ME A GOODBYE KISS?

11:50.981 --> 11:55.284
A BIG ONE? AND...
FACE THIS DIRECTION.

11:55.285 --> 11:57.216
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- NOTHING. IT JUST OVER HERE

11:57.217 --> 11:58.447
THE SUN MAKES YOUR
HAIR LOOK JEALOUS...

11:58.448 --> 11:59.990
I MEAN NICE.

12:02.192 --> 12:04.954
THAT GIRL ON THE FIRE
ESCAPE IS STARING AT US.

12:04.955 --> 12:06.826
THAT'S MY GIRLFRIEND SHEILA...

12:06.827 --> 12:08.327
WELL, EX-GIRLFRIEND.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.729
WE'RE IN A GREY AREA.
SHE CALLED IT A...

12:10.730 --> 12:13.803
- A PAUSE?
- I KNEW IT WAS A FANCY WORD.

12:13.804 --> 12:17.336
SO I WAS THINKING IF I HUNG OUT
WITH THE PRETTY OUT-OF-TOWN GIRL,

12:17.337 --> 12:20.039
I COULD KIND OF UNPAUSE THINGS,

12:20.040 --> 12:22.872
GET SHEILA BACK IN THE MARCO
BUSINESS IN A BIG WAY.

12:22.873 --> 12:25.975
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU
WERE JUST USING ME

12:25.976 --> 12:27.777
TO RE-INTEREST YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

12:27.778 --> 12:30.179
- WELL, YOU WERE USING ME TOO, RIGHT?
- WELL, YEAH,

12:30.180 --> 12:34.153
BUT I DID IT FOR...
CULTURAL RESEARCH.

12:34.154 --> 12:37.027
OKAY, FINE, ONE KISS, BUT
BOTH HANDS ABOVE THE WAIST.

12:39.930 --> 12:42.331
( phone buzzes )

12:42.332 --> 12:45.364
IT'S SHEILA. SHE'S
COMING DOWN HERE.

12:45.365 --> 12:48.899
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN A GIRL
GRABS YOU BY THE HAIR, RIGHT?

12:55.946 --> 12:58.978
TO MY BELOVED
GRANDDAUGHTER THERESA

12:58.979 --> 13:00.880
WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN AT MY SIDE,

13:00.881 --> 13:05.015
I LEAVE YOU MY 1984
CHEVROLET IMPALA.

13:06.917 --> 13:08.217
ENJOY THERE, THERESE.

13:08.218 --> 13:10.059
YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF
THOSE ON THE ROAD ANYMORE.

13:10.060 --> 13:13.562
THAT'S IT? THAT CAR DOESN'T
EVEN HAVE REVERSE.

13:13.563 --> 13:15.865
NOW TO MY GRANDSON JOEY

13:15.866 --> 13:18.868
AND HIS CURVY SPOSA TIFFANY.

13:18.869 --> 13:20.870
NOW THAT YOUR LOVE
HAS BEEN REKINDLED,

13:20.871 --> 13:24.203
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A NEST FOR THIS
FAMILY THAT'S SURE TO COME...

13:24.204 --> 13:27.306
A HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
MY HOUSE.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.808
THE HOUSE THAT THERESA
IS HOUSE-SITTING.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.811
WHOA WHOA WHOA, OLD WOMAN. YOU
MEAN THE PLACE WHERE ME AND ANGELO

13:32.812 --> 13:34.243
HAVE LIVED FOR THE
PAST SIX YEARS?

13:34.244 --> 13:36.485
THE HOUSE WE'VE REMODELED
WITH OUR BLOOD AND OUR SWEAT?

13:36.486 --> 13:40.519
THAT'S THE ONE. ENJOY.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.853
HOLD ON, DO YOU WANNA KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT CURVY TIFFANY HERE?

13:43.854 --> 13:44.954
HEY, YO, THERESA,
IT'S A BAD TIME.

13:44.955 --> 13:46.195
SHE IS NOT WHO YOU THINK SHE IS.

13:46.196 --> 13:48.028
EITHER YOU TELL HER OR I WILL.

13:50.060 --> 13:52.001
- IS THIS TRUE?
- ( sighs )

13:52.002 --> 13:53.463
HEY HEY, YO YO, DON'T TOUCH...
AH!

13:55.335 --> 13:57.606
IT'S TRUE. I'M NOT THE
WOMAN YOU THINK I AM.

13:57.607 --> 14:01.040
NONE OF US ARE. I COLOR MY HAIR.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.943
NO. NO, THIS IS NOT THE
WOMAN THAT JOEY MARRIED.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.976
- THE TRUTH IS...
- THE TRUTH... I ACTUALLY FORGOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

14:06.977 --> 14:08.277
( whispers ) YOU CAN HAVE
THE HOUSE, ALL RIGHT?

14:08.278 --> 14:09.349
I DON'T WANT THE DAMN HOUSE.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.853
SO NICE TO SEE TIFFANY
HERE, ISN'T IT?

14:14.885 --> 14:17.226
ONE LAST THING YOU
MUST PROMISE ME:

14:17.227 --> 14:20.229
YOU TWO WILL STAY
TOGETHER FOREVER.

14:20.230 --> 14:22.932
WELL, NONA, SEE,

14:22.933 --> 14:25.434
FOREVER... IT'S
SUCH A LONG TIME.

14:25.435 --> 14:28.397
- PROMISE ME!
- WELL, BUT... BUT SEE...

14:28.398 --> 14:31.201
YES. YES, NONA. OF COURSE
WE'LL ALWAYS STAY TOGETHER.

14:32.943 --> 14:36.206
OH. NOW I CAN DIE HAPPY.
( laughs )

14:43.583 --> 14:46.885
OH MY GOD. IS SHE...?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.358
SHE'S GONE.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.891
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

14:53.924 --> 14:57.197
THIS WOMAN KNEW HOW
TO PICK A MOMENT.

14:58.328 --> 15:00.971
YOU KNOW WHAT NONA
WOULD WANT RIGHT NOW?

15:02.973 --> 15:04.904
- MUSIC.
- ( folk music playing )

15:07.277 --> 15:08.938
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU JUST SAID?

15:08.939 --> 15:10.439
WELL, IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.281
YOU JUST MADE A
DEATHBED PROMISE.

15:12.282 --> 15:14.413
IN THIS FAMILY, THAT IS SACRED.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.345
OH.

15:16.346 --> 15:18.018
SURE, NOW YOU TELL ME.

15:25.155 --> 15:26.956
- ( sighs )
- SO, MEL,

15:26.957 --> 15:29.158
WHEN YOU JUST SWORE TO NONA THAT
WE WOULD BE TOGETHER FOREVER,

15:29.159 --> 15:31.360
- DID YOU MEAN THAT?
- NO!

15:31.361 --> 15:34.603
IT WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENT. I
WAS MAKING LIGHT CONVERSATION.

15:34.604 --> 15:37.606
A DEATHBED PROMISE IS
NOT LIGHT CONVERSATION!

15:37.607 --> 15:41.110
WHY ARE YOU GETTING SO UPSET? IT
WAS TIFFANY WHO MADE THE PROMISE.

15:41.111 --> 15:42.641
AND NOW I KNOW WHY
YOU DIVORCED HER,

15:42.642 --> 15:44.543
'CAUSE THAT WOMAN IS
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

15:44.544 --> 15:47.377
IT WASN'T TIFFANY IN THE BEDROOM
LAST NIGHT, MEL, IT WAS YOU AND ME.

15:49.049 --> 15:52.351
( stammers ) YOU KNOW, I'M
THINKING THAT MAYBE...

15:52.352 --> 15:55.554
MAYBE YOU AND ME IS NOT
SUCH A CRAZY IDEA.

15:55.555 --> 15:59.558
I THINK THAT DEFINES
"CRAZY IDEA."

15:59.559 --> 16:02.131
I MEAN, AFTER ALL THIS
TIME, DON'T WE...

16:02.132 --> 16:06.036
DON'T WE OWE IT TO OURSELVES TO
AT LEAST GIVE THIS THING A SHOT?

16:07.467 --> 16:10.199
LOOK, JOE, MY HISTORY
WITH MEN HAS BEEN...

16:10.200 --> 16:13.272
TO PUT THE BEST POSSIBLE FACE ON IT...
DISASTROUS.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.573
HEY, BEFORE YOU KNEW ME,

16:14.574 --> 16:16.075
I WAS ENGAGED, AND THAT BLEW UP.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.746
AND THEN, WELL, YOU
REMEMBER GEORGE.

16:17.747 --> 16:19.308
YEAH, THE GUY WHO WAS 10
YEARS YOUNGER THAN YOU.

16:19.309 --> 16:22.751
FIVE. EIGHT. WHAT
AM I, UNDER OATH?

16:22.752 --> 16:24.653
THEN OF COURSE, THERE WAS
AUSTIN WHO WAS PERFECT FOR YOU

16:24.654 --> 16:26.416
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT
HE HAD A VASECTOMY.

16:27.657 --> 16:28.987
THE TOPIC WAS YOUR
FAILED RELATIONSHIPS.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.320
- I WAS HELPING YOU OUT!
- SEE, WE ALWAYS DO THIS.

16:31.321 --> 16:33.662
- WE TURN EVERYTHING INTO AN ARGUMENT.
- WE DO NOT!

16:33.663 --> 16:36.165
OKAY, THIS COULD NEVER WORK!
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:36.166 --> 16:39.228
I'VE GOTTA CATCH THE NEXT
FLIGHT BACK TO TOLEDO.

16:39.229 --> 16:41.430
I HAVE MEETINGS. YOU HAVE
A LOT OF FAMILY BUSINESS

16:41.431 --> 16:42.601
TO DEAL WITH NOW
THAT NONA'S GONE.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.603
- YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY, MEL.
- I AM NOT!

16:44.604 --> 16:45.635
( gasps ) LOOK, PASTA.

16:56.386 --> 16:58.548
MY MAN, VANILLA ICE.

17:00.050 --> 17:01.520
YOU ALWAYS KNEW THE LADIES.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.223
YOU COULD TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.654
( knocks )

17:05.655 --> 17:07.796
JOEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?!

17:07.797 --> 17:10.329
I HEARD MEL TOOK A
CAB TO THE AIRPORT.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.761
I THOUGHT SOMETHING HAPPENED
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

17:12.762 --> 17:15.564
SO DID I, MA, BUT SHE DIDN'T.

17:15.565 --> 17:17.706
I'M JUST GONNA STAY HERE
WITH YOU FOR A WHILE

17:17.707 --> 17:20.109
- HELP YOU PLAN NONA'S FUNERAL.
- SPOILER ALERT!

17:20.110 --> 17:23.372
SHE WINDS UP IN A
BOX IN THE GROUND.

17:23.373 --> 17:24.613
HEY, THAT'S NONA
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:24.614 --> 17:26.715
AND SHE WOULD WANT
YOU TO LIVE LIFE,

17:26.716 --> 17:28.117
TO GO AFTER YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

17:28.118 --> 17:30.048
NOW GET UP OFF THAT BED AND GO!

17:30.049 --> 17:32.551
SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND, MOM.
I TOLD YOU WE GOT NO FUTURE.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.084
- I THINK YOU DO!
- BUT ALL WE DO IS FIGHT!

17:35.085 --> 17:38.687
FIGHTING? THAT'S
ITALIAN FOR LOVE!

17:38.688 --> 17:40.729
HEY, MA, WHY YOU GIVING ME
SUCH A HARD TIME RIGHT NOW?!

17:40.730 --> 17:43.362
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.833
YEAH, I LOVE YOU TOO!

17:44.834 --> 17:47.736
YOU SEE HOW WE'RE TALKING?
THIS IS LOVE!

17:47.737 --> 17:52.541
NOW GO AFTER HER BEFORE
I REALLY GET MAD.

17:52.542 --> 17:54.504
THAT'S WHAT VANILLA
ICE WOULD DO.

17:55.705 --> 17:57.146
YOU KNOW WHAT, MA? YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:57.147 --> 17:58.707
I'M GONNA DO IT!
NOW GIMME A HUG.

17:58.708 --> 18:01.611
NOW! GO!

18:04.214 --> 18:07.216
- THERE'S LIKE 75 SANDWICHES IN HERE...
- ( car honking )

18:07.217 --> 18:10.559
...AND A QUART OF OLIVES.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.761
MOM DIDN'T WANT US TO HAVE
TO STOP FOR ANYTHING.

18:12.762 --> 18:16.195
DID SHE ALSO TELL YOU TO
DRIVE 190 MILES PER HOUR?

18:16.196 --> 18:17.666
WE MIGHT BEAT AUNT MEL HOME.

18:17.667 --> 18:19.598
IT'S GONNA BE CLOSE.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.730
( sighs ) IT'S ALMOST LIKE...

18:21.731 --> 18:23.672
YOU'RE CHASING HER.

18:23.673 --> 18:25.734
- ( rustling )
- WHAT'S THAT BOX DOING,

18:25.735 --> 18:27.676
SITTING IN YOUR BROTHER'S
LAP BACK THERE?

18:27.677 --> 18:29.678
- DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.
- WELL, NORMALLY I WOULDN'T,

18:29.679 --> 18:32.312
BUT THE... BOX IS MOVING.

18:33.543 --> 18:35.514
- ( squeaking )
- OH! IT'S THE RAT!

18:35.515 --> 18:37.686
HE SAID HE KILLED IT!

18:37.687 --> 18:39.788
WHAT? WHAT? WE HOME?

18:39.789 --> 18:41.550
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND THERE, BUDDY?

18:41.551 --> 18:43.392
YEAH, THAT'S JUST...
THAT'S CANNOLI.

18:43.393 --> 18:45.654
I WAS SUPPOSED TO KILL HIM FOR
MAMA GLORIA, BUT I DIDN'T.

18:45.655 --> 18:48.757
SO NOW HE'S IN THE RODENT
PROTECTION PROGRAM.

18:48.758 --> 18:51.630
EWW EWW EWW! THROW
HIM OUT THE WINDOW.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.333
EASE UP, OKAY? CANNOLI HERE

18:54.334 --> 18:56.305
HAS BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

18:56.306 --> 18:58.607
SO I'M GUESSING IF I ASK
YOU ABOUT AUNT MEL,

18:58.608 --> 19:02.371
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO DUCK, DODGE
AND NOT TELL ME ANYTHING, RIGHT?

19:02.372 --> 19:03.772
( sighs )

19:03.773 --> 19:05.544
ALL RIGHT, FINE,
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.716
I WON'T MENTION IT AGAIN.

19:07.747 --> 19:08.848
OKAY, HERE IT IS.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.181
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
IT'S KIND OF RIDICULOUS

19:12.182 --> 19:14.583
THAT WE'RE ALL STILL PLAYING
ALONG WITH THIS WHOLE,

19:14.584 --> 19:16.425
YOU KNOW, I-NEED-TO-BE-
YOUR-NANNY STORY.

19:16.426 --> 19:18.187
I MEAN, YOU'RE ALMOST IN COLLEGE

19:18.188 --> 19:21.331
AND RYDER'S, WHAT,
IN 14th GRADE NOW?

19:23.593 --> 19:26.196
I DON'T SEE WHY THERE'S ANY
REASON WHY YOUR AUNT AND I...

19:27.237 --> 19:28.597
CAN'T GO FOR THIS THING.

19:28.598 --> 19:30.440
ARE YOU SAYING YOU LIKE HER?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.343
YES.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.404
YES, I LIKE HER.

19:35.405 --> 19:36.705
AH! FINALLY!

19:36.706 --> 19:38.848
WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED?
WE HIT SOMETHING?

19:40.510 --> 19:43.782
Woman on TV: Ryan,
people said I was crazy,

19:43.783 --> 19:46.285
but crazy people take
chances on love.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.287
- Kiss me.
- ( stammers )

19:48.288 --> 19:50.389
YOU'RE RUINING A GREAT
FRIENDSHIP, JULIA.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.422
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE
ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER AGAIN.

19:53.563 --> 19:56.625
- ROMANTIC COMEDIES SUCK.
- ( knocking )

19:56.626 --> 20:00.269
GO AWAY! I'VE GOT A
VICIOUS DOG IN HERE!

20:00.270 --> 20:01.671
( barks )

20:06.506 --> 20:07.876
HEY, MEL.

20:07.877 --> 20:10.439
AUSTIN, WHAT ARE YOU...?

20:10.440 --> 20:13.482
LET ME GET THROUGH THIS, 'CAUSE
I PRACTICED THE WHOLE WAY HERE.

20:13.483 --> 20:15.744
- ( sighs )
- ( door closes )

20:15.745 --> 20:17.617
I WANT YOU TO GIVE
ME ANOTHER CHANCE.

20:18.688 --> 20:19.949
I WANT YOU IN MY LIFE.

20:21.591 --> 20:23.553
AND I WANT US TO HAVE
A FAMILY TOGETHER.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.395
BUT I THOUGHT YOU
NEVER WANTED KIDS.

20:26.396 --> 20:27.656
THAT'S WHY YOU HAD
THAT VASECTOMY.

20:27.657 --> 20:29.699
AND NOW I'M READY TO REVERSE IT.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.731
I COULDN'T FIND A GREETING
CARD TO SAY THAT,

20:32.732 --> 20:35.705
SO... I CAME HERE
TO TELL YOU MYSELF.

20:37.637 --> 20:41.471
WOW. THAT AND FLOWERS.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.579
OH, I'M SO EXCITED.

20:50.580 --> 20:52.751
I CAN SEE THE BIG
SMILE ON HER FACE.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.253
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO IN.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.825
YEAH, YOU SHOULD DO
THIS BY YOURSELF.

20:56.826 --> 20:58.927
RYDER AND I WILL PRETEND
TO UNLOAD THE CAR.

20:58.928 --> 21:00.389
BUT WE ARE UNLOADING THE CAR.

21:00.390 --> 21:04.893
YES, AND LET'S DO IT
VERY VERY SLOWLY.

21:04.894 --> 21:08.698
- GOOD LUCK.
- ( chuckles ) THANKS.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.745
- MEL.
- JOE.

21:21.851 --> 21:22.852
AUSTIN?
