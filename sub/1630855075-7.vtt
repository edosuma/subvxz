WEBVTT

00:19.853 --> 00:20.687
Captain?

00:21.688 --> 00:24.482
Ortiz. Just musing a bit.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.109
Upon what, sir?

00:26.735 --> 00:30.196
The journey back to Spain,
the difficulty of it.

00:30.739 --> 00:36.161
Yes, the crossing to get here was hard.
Many men died.

00:36.161 --> 00:42.333
You weren't even first mate then.
Only after Pablo died of scurvy.

00:43.752 --> 00:44.836
I thought you...

00:46.087 --> 00:48.840
Pretty sure he also had scurvy.

00:50.091 --> 00:52.802
But what if we just...

00:53.928 --> 00:54.888
Just...

00:55.472 --> 00:56.639
Go back.

01:00.226 --> 01:04.189
Just to clarify, the captain is
talking about stealing the gold.

01:05.231 --> 01:06.399
Is he?

01:07.442 --> 01:10.820
Human life is short, but gold is eternal.

01:11.404 --> 01:14.324
And only God can possess the eternal.

01:14.324 --> 01:17.869
- The king may not agree.
- If he finds out.

01:18.912 --> 01:23.374
And at most, we're talking
about a series of misdemeanors.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.585
I am sorry, captain.

01:25.585 --> 01:30.340
I still think it makes us criminals,
and I could not live with myself if--

01:34.385 --> 01:39.724
Ortiz has died of scurvy!
I need a new first mate!

01:43.978 --> 01:46.231
Attention, everyone! Tie up the sails.

02:15.051 --> 02:17.428
Shit. Fuck...

02:19.931 --> 02:22.725
Ma'am. Ma'am, hey. Hi.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.436
Hey. Okay. Just...

02:26.688 --> 02:29.482
Hang in there.
Ambulance is on its way, okay?

02:30.233 --> 02:33.153
Do you want me to call someone?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

02:34.445 --> 02:37.824
Oh, wait. No, shit.
Here, I need you to unlock your phone.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.617
All right. All right.

02:39.617 --> 02:40.535
Uh...

02:42.579 --> 02:45.331
Yes! Oh, fuck.

02:45.832 --> 02:46.958
Is it one of these?

02:47.584 --> 02:50.420
Oh, no, wait, wait.
That one was me. Mike. Mike?

02:52.046 --> 02:55.300
No, no, no! I'm calling.
Stay awake, stay awake. Fuck.

02:58.887 --> 02:59.762
Hey!

03:00.597 --> 03:02.098
I want my phone call now!

03:07.854 --> 03:09.439
About fucking time.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.481
Hey!

03:27.040 --> 03:28.750
<i>So where are Moss and Delly?</i>

03:28.750 --> 03:32.128
- What's happening at the dock?
- This was not the plan.

03:32.128 --> 03:34.547
No? This wasn't the plan?

03:36.507 --> 03:40.053
- Having me taken out by the police?
- You, yeah. Me, no.

03:41.721 --> 03:46.643
<i>That little suck Andy set me up.
He had me arrested.</i>

03:47.477 --> 03:50.063
For that old dude
that blew up in the porta-potty.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.818
And now thanks to him,
we don't have eyes on Moss.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.571
Moss is stupid, but he's not that stupid.

03:59.447 --> 04:03.660
If he saw us, both of us get arrested,
he's not going to the marina.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.204
- Which is why I used my call for Patsy--
- What?

04:06.204 --> 04:07.664
- Hey, hang on.
- You got a call?

04:07.664 --> 04:10.041
Shut up. Yes, I got a fucking phone call
and I called Patsy.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.086
So that her family could get out.

04:14.212 --> 04:15.088
Did she?

04:17.966 --> 04:20.551
- I don't know. She didn't answer.
- Shit.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.180
We don't know what that means.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.724
- Oh, come on.
- We don't.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.644
- Are you kidding me?
- It doesn't mean anything.

04:29.644 --> 04:32.063
It means that she wouldn't be in danger

04:32.063 --> 04:34.857
if you hadn't gotten me arrested
so you could take the gold.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.777
What's wrong with you?
Why do you always think the worst of me?

04:37.777 --> 04:39.821
I find it a very useful place to start.

04:39.821 --> 04:43.074
I had you arrested
because I didn't want you to kill Moss.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.952
Oh, what fucking bullshit.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.997
Bullshit? I wanted you to let us do it.

04:48.997 --> 04:52.959
- Why do you care so much about who did it?
- Because you're my son!

04:54.252 --> 04:56.754
It's a bridge I did not want you to cross.

04:59.173 --> 05:03.261
- I was a cop.
- And that's completely different, okay?

05:04.387 --> 05:07.015
Some old man dies,
some guy blowing up in a porta-potty,

05:07.015 --> 05:10.143
that's collateral damage, okay?
That shit happens.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.478
But you picking up a gun

05:13.104 --> 05:16.065
and shooting a guy
because you want him dead...

05:18.609 --> 05:20.570
that's something you don't come back from.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.795
Okay, Valentine. You made bail.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.339
Aha!

05:40.131 --> 05:41.841
- Of course he did.
- Yeah.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.094
- Right this way, sir.
- Shut up. Patsy got my message.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.017
Whoa, not you Valentine.

05:51.642 --> 05:52.602
Him Valentine.

05:54.979 --> 05:55.813
Let's go.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.240
<i>Yes. Hello, sir.</i>

06:06.240 --> 06:10.203
<i>Uh, this is Randy from the marina.
The lady cop's been shot.</i>

06:10.953 --> 06:13.122
<i>Yeah, she can't talk right now.</i>

06:13.122 --> 06:15.833
<i>It's pretty bad. She's bleeding a lot.</i>

06:15.833 --> 06:18.795
<i>And there's another guy here.
I think he's dead.</i>

06:18.795 --> 06:20.838
<i>I don't know. I don't wanna look.</i>

06:20.838 --> 06:22.632
<i>- Uh...</i>

06:22.632 --> 06:24.217
<i>Here! Here! Over here!</i>

06:29.931 --> 06:33.309
There's the reaction I wanted before.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.144
Surprise.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.981
- You shot Iris?
- No. Who's Iris?

06:39.565 --> 06:40.483
At the dock.

06:41.609 --> 06:42.693
Did you shoot her?

06:43.402 --> 06:46.405
No. I didn't go to the dock

06:46.405 --> 06:49.534
because we figured out
your little ambush plan.

06:50.326 --> 06:52.703
But don't say thanks
for bailing you out or anything.

06:52.703 --> 06:55.456
Fuck you. I need to get to the hospital.
What the fuck?

06:58.334 --> 07:00.461
You might end up there later.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.547
But you got work to do first.

07:09.137 --> 07:12.515
Let's go. All right? Come on. Come on.

07:18.187 --> 07:19.355
Get in.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.648
Iris has been shot.

07:20.648 --> 07:23.025
Tell this asshole
I need to get to the hospital.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.319
I get why you're upset.

07:25.319 --> 07:27.280
The wrong girl taking the bullet and all.

07:29.198 --> 07:30.908
What are you gonna do anyway?

07:31.742 --> 07:33.411
You're not a doctor.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.371
All you are is a driver.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.463
Now, take me to the fucking gold.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.299
Where it really is this time.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.077
Oh, I got you.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.206
Goddamn it! Andy!

08:18.206 --> 08:20.124
Just hold your horses, chief.

08:20.708 --> 08:25.254
- Oh, finally.
- I'm sorry I missed Mike in here with you.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.465
That would have been
a picture for your Christmas card.

08:30.968 --> 08:34.472
I don't know what bug you got up your ass,
but we can work it out later.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.099
No, no, no. You're good where you're at.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.976
I'm just here to visit.

08:49.362 --> 08:54.116
Look, I don't know
what you think I've done,

08:55.576 --> 08:57.286
but you need to listen to me.

08:57.286 --> 08:58.496
No, no.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.499
We're gonna do this
the other way around for once.

09:02.833 --> 09:06.420
See, what you did is you broke my heart.

09:08.839 --> 09:11.092
I tried to count them all up,

09:11.092 --> 09:13.344
the times I looked the other way,

09:13.344 --> 09:16.806
even when you didn't have
enough respect for me

09:16.806 --> 09:19.183
to bother to hide what you were up to.

09:19.183 --> 09:22.728
I told myself,
"It's nothing serious. Where's the harm?

09:22.728 --> 09:25.815
The old man's just making
a few extra bucks off smuggled cigars

09:25.815 --> 09:28.192
or maybe something a little stronger
now and then."

09:28.818 --> 09:31.195
- But you owe me.
- I owe you?

09:32.530 --> 09:33.614
Because what?

09:34.949 --> 09:36.576
I hurt your feelings?

09:37.785 --> 09:42.623
So you bring me in here,
and you bust me on some bullshit charges

09:42.623 --> 09:45.334
about some guy
who died from taking a crap?

09:48.671 --> 09:50.756
Man, that's not why you're in here.

09:55.761 --> 09:56.971
You know this guy?

09:58.806 --> 09:59.890
Whoo!

10:02.059 --> 10:03.477
- Fuck yeah!

10:03.477 --> 10:06.606
Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

10:06.606 --> 10:07.523
Yeah!

10:08.691 --> 10:12.820
- Never seen him before in my life.
- Yeah, he didn't know you either.

10:13.529 --> 10:17.033
But luckily,
in this closed system of ours,

10:17.033 --> 10:20.786
that being the underbelly
of Central Florida street drug crime,

10:21.621 --> 10:23.497
everybody knows somebody.

10:23.998 --> 10:27.126
So I give the cops
who I bought the drugs from,

10:27.835 --> 10:29.003
and I get a deal?

10:29.003 --> 10:30.880
I tell you my supplier and I walk.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.381
We don't meet in person.

10:32.882 --> 10:36.344
All I know is once my product comes in,
it goes up river on a boat.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.679
Whose boat?

10:39.555 --> 10:41.766
She's speedy, I'll give you that.

10:42.725 --> 10:43.601
Take care now.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.313
<i>It's like that funny poster you see,</i>

10:47.313 --> 10:50.483
where, one after the other,
a little fish gets eaten by a bigger fish,

10:51.067 --> 10:52.443
except the opposite.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.780
See, you got eaten
by the littlest fish of all.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.491
- You can't do this.
This isn't me.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.076
This is the DEA.

11:01.035 --> 11:04.163
- And that's federal.
My daughter's life is at stake.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.706
You need to help me.

11:05.706 --> 11:09.418
Oh, I don't, actually.

11:10.419 --> 11:13.714
This relationship is no longer symbiotic.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.592
But I'll call Patsy,

11:18.260 --> 11:19.804
and you call a lawyer.

11:27.978 --> 11:29.230
These are the floats.

11:29.230 --> 11:34.110
We dive down, we attach them
to each corner of the truck and the tires,

11:35.236 --> 11:36.654
inflate them with the compressor,

11:37.738 --> 11:39.240
the truck pops up,

11:39.240 --> 11:42.076
and then we float her to shore
like a fucking raft.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.285
Watch your step.

11:43.285 --> 11:46.872
We wouldn't want you to slip
and hurt yourself before we get started.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.207
Thanks. Now give me the phone.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.167
- I need to call the hospital.
Eh...

11:50.918 --> 11:52.753
I changed my mind on that.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.881
I feel like you'll work harder
if I let you call after.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.467
So get to work.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.138
It was supposed to be a four-man job.

12:02.763 --> 12:05.724
Then I guess
you'll have to work four times harder.

12:21.490 --> 12:26.996
My dad never-- What do you call it?
- groomed me for this.

12:26.996 --> 12:30.416
He never said,
"Son, someday all of this will be yours."

12:32.042 --> 12:33.252
It just was.

12:36.380 --> 12:42.011
Then everybody was looking at me
like the only thing I was, was not him.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.643
Everybody except you.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.399
You made me think I could be someone.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.402
You pulled me through.

13:03.866 --> 13:04.700
Same.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.162
Wait. Wait.

13:50.913 --> 13:51.956
Is it all ready?

13:53.582 --> 13:56.835
- You just have to turn on the compressor.
- Oh. Let me do it.

13:56.835 --> 13:59.463
I mean, I should earn my share, right?

14:01.215 --> 14:02.174
Red button.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.426
Just push it.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.341
Woo-hoo!

14:44.341 --> 14:47.803
- Did you see that? That's fucking awesome!
- Moss!

14:47.803 --> 14:49.722
That's fucking awesome. Hey.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.746
Come on.

15:33.974 --> 15:34.808
One thing.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.312
Hey, hey. Don't you pop that.

15:38.312 --> 15:41.065
I might, though. And down it goes.

15:41.565 --> 15:44.360
- Put the fucking knife away.
- Is shooting it any better?

15:49.406 --> 15:52.493
He won't sink it.
He wants the gold as much as I do.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.996
- More.
- Okay. What?

15:55.996 --> 15:57.373
So this gold...

15:58.415 --> 16:01.085
What's the split? A third each?

16:02.294 --> 16:06.173
Here's the split.
I take it all and I let you live.

16:07.132 --> 16:10.010
Counting on my will to live
is a sucker bet.

16:10.511 --> 16:14.056
How do you feel about your sister?
Be honest with yourself.

16:15.015 --> 16:17.184
You know
you'll never manage to pay me back,

16:17.184 --> 16:19.061
not if you live to be 100.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.105
So you know I'm being generous

16:21.105 --> 16:23.273
when I say
I will give you exactly as much gold

16:23.273 --> 16:25.359
as you need to pay me back for all that.

16:26.568 --> 16:29.863
And then we're square,
and your family is safe.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.032
On my word of honor.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.369
Mike.

16:36.412 --> 16:40.040
You've been saying this whole time
all you want is out, right?

16:50.634 --> 16:51.844
I should have gotten out

16:51.844 --> 16:54.722
the night you crawled back
into my motel room like a snake.

17:44.646 --> 17:47.566
Fucking gamblers, man.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.986
- There's nothing.
- It was always nothing.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.989
You're all the same, man.
Every one of you.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.866
Chasing some empty truck.

17:56.366 --> 17:59.369
You know what? I changed my mind.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.914
You can have all the gold.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.793
There's still the matter of your debt.

18:05.793 --> 18:09.046
I'm afraid I gotta settle it
the same way I settled Gil's.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.965
The two of you can have a laugh
over all this when you meet.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.512
I thought you didn't kill Gil.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.805
I didn't.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.974
That's right. He hasn't killed anyone
personally since my father.

18:20.974 --> 18:23.811
Because my dad told me to do it.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.104
We went over this.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.398
Just like Jimmy killed Gil
because I told him to do it.

18:28.398 --> 18:30.859
That's how the boss-employee
relationship works.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.928
You know what, Mike?

19:40.512 --> 19:41.680
Let me tell you why--

19:56.153 --> 19:57.696
Look what you made me do.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.158
Him or me?

20:05.621 --> 20:06.622
All of you.

20:12.794 --> 20:14.504
I do have a question, though.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.260
If you had that gun,
why didn't you use it before?

20:20.260 --> 20:23.222
Sure, and when would have been good?
At your sister's house?

20:23.764 --> 20:26.308
Or in the car
driving down the highway with a gun on me?

20:26.308 --> 20:27.809
Or in front of the police station?

20:27.809 --> 20:29.853
Plus, who I might actually have to shoot,

20:29.853 --> 20:33.523
since you were happy
to let me drive blindly into an ambush.

20:33.523 --> 20:36.777
- I thought you were with him.
- I know you did, and fuck you for that!

20:36.777 --> 20:39.404
I heard you in his motel room, Delly.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.032
- When?
- This afternoon.

20:42.032 --> 20:45.077
- You told him that you've been playing me.
- To save your life!

20:49.581 --> 20:51.208
Well, I know that now.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.585
Is that a thank you?

20:58.590 --> 20:59.424
Thank you.

21:12.020 --> 21:12.854
Freeze.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.190
Dude, I have the gun.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.985
I know you have the gun
'cause it's my goddamn gun!

21:17.985 --> 21:20.529
- What?
- Deputy Ketcher?

21:20.529 --> 21:21.446
Yeah.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.490
Wait, you know this guy?

21:24.533 --> 21:27.327
He's right. It's his gun. I stole it.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.204
Hard to mistake it.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.456
Wait, so he's a cop?

21:31.456 --> 21:33.500
- Yeah.
- Because, seriously...

21:35.043 --> 21:37.921
I don't care about that, okay?
I really don't.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.550
I'm not gonna go into everything
that's happened the last few days,

21:41.550 --> 21:43.218
except to say I have a new understanding

21:43.218 --> 21:45.345
for people living
on the margins of society.

21:46.596 --> 21:50.851
I did have a finger up my ass,
but all I wanted was a gun.

21:51.435 --> 21:52.436
That's it.

21:52.436 --> 21:55.522
You wouldn't think that would be
hard to get in Florida after all.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.357
But of course
I had to pick a murder weapon,

21:57.357 --> 22:00.277
which in retrospect was probably
also inevitable, given the odds.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.863
I probably rode past three or four of them

22:02.863 --> 22:04.865
by the side of the road on the way here.

22:04.865 --> 22:08.410
But right now,
I swear to you beyond any doubt,

22:08.410 --> 22:10.871
I have zero interest in either one of you.

22:10.871 --> 22:15.292
All I want right now in the whole world
is my gun back

22:15.292 --> 22:17.711
and to get the fuck out of Florida.

22:17.711 --> 22:21.423
Problem is, your gun
is now a murder weapon.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.051
And there's a bullet missing.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.763
A bullet from your personal weapon
inside a murder victim.

22:27.763 --> 22:30.640
That's something you don't want,
and you should take that too.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.437
- From his head?
- No, it probably went through.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.066
What was the angle?

22:40.984 --> 22:42.611
Right where she's standing.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.615
It could be lodged in that truck.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.201
Yeah, or maybe it ricocheted. There, look.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.130
- Here.
- Thank you very much.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.592
Hey, can you give me a hand before you go?

23:05.592 --> 23:07.344
Sure. With what?

23:41.419 --> 23:42.963
You wanna say something?

23:43.922 --> 23:46.466
My father told me
never to speak ill of the dead.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.178
But then
that degenerate fucker killed him.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.529
Thank you.

24:08.697 --> 24:09.739
Oh.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.367
I don't have enough money
for the bus home.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.452
That sucks, but it's not our problem.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.247
Sorry.

24:30.886 --> 24:31.928
Look left.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.514
- Look forward.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.234
Okay, now can we go?

24:52.199 --> 24:53.283
What?

24:56.578 --> 24:57.954
We have to make a stop.

25:01.625 --> 25:02.459
No.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.670
I need to go to the hospital.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.006
Are you fucking kidding me?

25:08.006 --> 25:09.549
To see if Iris is okay.

25:09.549 --> 25:11.968
- So call her.
- It's my fault she's hurt.

25:12.677 --> 25:13.929
But it's not mine.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.847
I need to give her the tape of Moss.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.015
What tape?

25:18.558 --> 25:19.768
Him confessing to murder.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.187
You have me doing murder. Give me that.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.772
I'll erase your part. Don't worry.

25:23.772 --> 25:24.814
Will you?

25:26.107 --> 25:28.193
- What do you mean, will I?
- I don't know, Mike.

25:29.361 --> 25:32.280
I just know
how many times I've sat around waiting

25:32.280 --> 25:36.159
while you take care of your needs,
and your wants,

25:36.159 --> 25:39.955
and your sister, and your ex-wife,
and now it's my turn, me.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.915
I need. I--

25:41.915 --> 25:45.335
I just fucking killed someone for you,
and what? Nothing.

25:47.712 --> 25:48.838
All of you.

25:48.838 --> 25:51.716
All you guys thought
I was just some character in your stories

25:51.716 --> 25:53.176
but this is my story.

25:53.176 --> 25:54.219
Always was.

25:54.219 --> 25:57.722
My shot at not having to
ask some man for what I want.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.308
My dad for a loan,
Moss to take care of me,

26:00.308 --> 26:02.769
you to help me with the gold,
and now there is no gold.

26:02.769 --> 26:05.939
I have to get
the fuck out of Dodge right now.

26:08.441 --> 26:11.361
And I don't need you to be in that part,
Mike. I don't. I'm fine.

26:11.361 --> 26:13.154
But I want you to be, so...

26:16.408 --> 26:18.868
Waiting around,
hoping you'll pick me for once, is over.

26:18.868 --> 26:22.956
So you can be in the next chapter or not.
Either way, it's now, so choose.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.305
Hi.

27:22.849 --> 27:23.850
Hi yourself.

27:26.811 --> 27:28.605
The good news is you're alive.

27:29.522 --> 27:30.857
The bad news...

27:30.857 --> 27:32.400
Still in Florida.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.360
Mm-hm.

27:34.652 --> 27:36.237
I'm afraid so.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.157
- Hey.
- Hmm?

27:40.033 --> 27:41.242
I got you a present.

27:46.206 --> 27:47.499
Moss's confession.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.584
Two murders.

27:49.584 --> 27:53.004
See? Name brand came through.

27:55.256 --> 27:59.636
When I get my phone back,
I'll get a warrant for Moss's arrest.

28:04.307 --> 28:06.101
Moss is gonna be hard to find.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.019
How hard?

28:12.690 --> 28:15.735
The important thing is that you got him
and closed your first case.

28:15.735 --> 28:17.946
Yeah, but I can't bring him in

28:19.114 --> 28:20.031
or say why.

28:20.031 --> 28:22.992
And you managed to ditch me
long enough to pull off your heist,

28:22.992 --> 28:26.663
so I'd say the big winner here is you.

28:27.997 --> 28:28.998
Not at all.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.335
I was shot.

28:33.920 --> 28:34.838
I know.

28:38.091 --> 28:40.760
But at least I wanted you
to have what you came here for.

28:43.888 --> 28:44.806
I did.

28:49.185 --> 28:51.771
I got to feel what it's like to be you.

28:54.941 --> 28:58.027
To bet everything you have
on a long shot...

29:00.488 --> 29:01.740
and lose.

29:05.285 --> 29:07.495
The only difference is I can quit.

29:11.958 --> 29:14.627
<i>We don't need the information
on the flash drive anymore.</i>

29:15.670 --> 29:17.172
Moss won't be a problem.

29:22.051 --> 29:23.386
I need different help.

29:24.929 --> 29:26.222
I need to disappear.

29:29.893 --> 29:32.353
That's something
I know you have experience in, so...

29:33.104 --> 29:34.814
No, I'm fine. I'm okay.

29:37.525 --> 29:38.359
Okay.

29:41.237 --> 29:42.238
Thanks, Mom.

Hello.

33:33.803 --> 33:35.763
Welcome to the Palm's Motel.

33:36.305 --> 33:38.558
Uh, how many nights
will you be staying with us?

33:38.558 --> 33:39.600
All of them.

33:40.852 --> 33:41.894
This is my motel.

33:46.399 --> 33:48.568
<i>A Florida man was hunting pythons</i>

33:48.568 --> 33:49.944
<i>in the Everglades yesterday</i>

33:49.944 --> 33:52.280
<i>when the hunter became the hunted.</i>

33:52.280 --> 33:55.867
<i>Wildlife authorities say
he was killed by an 18-foot snake,</i>

33:55.867 --> 33:59.037
<i>which then choked to death
trying to swallow him.</i>

33:59.037 --> 34:02.665
<i>While authorities say that python attacks
on humans are rare,</i>

34:02.665 --> 34:04.292
<i>they will eat alligators.</i>

34:04.292 --> 34:08.504
<i>So maybe it was confused
by the hunter's brand-new alligator boots.</i>

34:08.504 --> 34:10.590
I just wanted new alligator boots
and an airboat.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.759
Now I'll never get new alligator boots
and an airboat.

34:12.759 --> 34:17.138
<i>After the break, Chip Devons brings us
part four of his special report...</i>

34:17.138 --> 34:19.182
<i>Where's my gold?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

34:22.560 --> 34:23.561
Buzz is dead.

34:25.772 --> 34:26.606
How?

34:27.356 --> 34:28.566
Hunting snakes.

34:29.525 --> 34:30.359
Hmm.

34:31.194 --> 34:35.573
He was also wearing new alligator boots
and had a new airboat.

34:35.573 --> 34:38.284
Precisely the things
he said he would buy with the gold

34:38.284 --> 34:39.535
when he got it.

34:39.535 --> 34:42.455
Which he did, when you stole it.

34:43.164 --> 34:44.165
How could I?

34:45.249 --> 34:46.959
I've been locked up in here.

34:46.959 --> 34:49.045
You did it the night before.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.299
The night Dutch blew up.

34:54.675 --> 34:56.219
- What is this?
My boat.

34:56.761 --> 34:59.055
The heat is on you two,
and it's bad for all of us.

34:59.055 --> 35:02.725
Get on the boat, go somewhere.
I promise you'll get your cut.

35:02.725 --> 35:04.977
I'm not going back to that motel.

35:04.977 --> 35:08.272
You can stay at my place.
I'll crash with Ray-Ray.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.691
<i>The three of you
used the salvage equipment</i>

35:10.691 --> 35:12.401
<i>to raise the truck, get the gold.</i>

35:12.401 --> 35:15.738
<i>Sank the truck again and put
the equipment back on Ray-Ray's truck.</i>

35:15.738 --> 35:18.157
<i>What I didn't notice was
that it was still wet.</i>

35:23.955 --> 35:26.791
"Is it wrong to want the gold
that gives you a better life?"

35:28.501 --> 35:29.335
What?

35:30.211 --> 35:33.005
<i>Wagon Train.</i> You wouldn't remember it.

35:33.881 --> 35:36.509
Barbara Stanwyck?

35:36.509 --> 35:37.802
Yeah, I loved her.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.304
Delly's got a little bit of that in her.

35:40.304 --> 35:41.639
You know, I...

35:42.181 --> 35:45.017
I thought, I really did,
and that's my fault...

35:46.352 --> 35:48.896
but I thought for one minute
back in that cell that night

35:49.480 --> 35:52.733
that you did really care
more about me than the gold.

35:53.484 --> 35:56.487
But as you were saying that,
you had already stolen it.

35:56.487 --> 35:58.197
Not from you.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.492
From her.

36:02.577 --> 36:03.828
I didn't trust her.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.831
I tried to tell you that,
but you wouldn't listen.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.041
I let you think
there was nothing in the truck

36:09.041 --> 36:11.961
so she would leave
with that asshole boyfriend.

36:11.961 --> 36:14.005
Buzz and Ray-Ray
were gonna take their share

36:14.005 --> 36:16.090
and then were gonna hide ours, okay?

36:16.090 --> 36:19.093
Until the boyfriend and Delly were gone.

36:20.094 --> 36:23.347
Then Ray-Ray got himself killed,
and I got myself locked up in here.

36:23.347 --> 36:25.683
Unless you think that
that was part of the plan.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.977
Totally. Absolutely.

36:27.977 --> 36:31.272
I can see you doing a stretch in here
for $100 million.

36:31.272 --> 36:34.066
I wanna see
my granddaughter grow up, so no.

36:35.818 --> 36:37.987
- You just can't help it, can you?
- Help what?

36:37.987 --> 36:42.909
Lying. Just give me the truth
one time in my whole life.

36:43.659 --> 36:44.619
Just once.

36:48.414 --> 36:52.543
You were never going to
tell me about the gold, were you?

36:56.839 --> 36:57.673
Fine.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.469
I was never gonna tell you.

37:04.472 --> 37:05.431
There you go.

37:06.849 --> 37:07.725
Why not?

37:14.815 --> 37:16.275
Because you would have left.

37:19.195 --> 37:20.071
Okay?

37:25.409 --> 37:26.911
But you're here now...

37:29.163 --> 37:30.915
and I'll be getting out soon.

37:32.375 --> 37:36.212
You won't get out soon,
and I won't be here when you do.

37:37.463 --> 37:38.839
Where are you gonna be?

37:39.966 --> 37:41.092
Iris is gone.

37:41.759 --> 37:42.802
Delly is gone.

37:43.469 --> 37:46.264
<i>And you are right back here
where you started.</i>

37:47.390 --> 37:48.391
<i>Nowhere.</i>

37:49.058 --> 37:51.811
<i>I was really pulling for you and Iris.</i>

37:52.603 --> 37:54.146
<i>That Delly...</i>

37:55.856 --> 37:57.900
she brought out the me in you.

38:00.027 --> 38:02.905
And as a father,
I was really hoping for something better.

38:04.490 --> 38:08.869
But I guess in the end,
you and I are just the same.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.707
Some, yeah.

38:15.584 --> 38:16.877
The difference is...

38:19.463 --> 38:21.215
one of us can still walk out of here.

38:28.931 --> 38:30.182
<i>So you talked to Dad?</i>

38:30.808 --> 38:32.226
<i>He looks good in orange.</i>

38:34.353 --> 38:35.271
Rum and Coke?

38:36.188 --> 38:39.108
You want one? I get them for free.
My brother owns the place.

38:39.108 --> 38:40.985
Nah. He's just the manager.

38:42.069 --> 38:45.364
Oops. I hope I don't get him fired.
He has no other job skills.

38:46.741 --> 38:47.700
How are you?

38:49.243 --> 38:51.620
Still wearing the ring.
We'll see how that goes.

38:52.830 --> 38:53.664
What about you?

38:55.082 --> 38:57.585
I've lost everything
that ever mattered in my life.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.962
I'm stuck here in Florida.

38:59.962 --> 39:06.218
I live in a spare room
above a convicted felon's bar.

39:06.218 --> 39:08.554
So I'm golden.

39:09.096 --> 39:10.348
Oh, come on.

39:10.890 --> 39:12.600
You haven't lost everything.

39:13.809 --> 39:16.812
- You still have an angry ex-wife.

39:18.773 --> 39:21.609
I also have a sister
I owe a ton of apologies to.

39:22.151 --> 39:25.446
Don't start now.
It's a long list, and I can't stay.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.368
I'm sorry about Deacon.

39:31.827 --> 39:33.037
It needed to happen.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.499
I'm almost grateful. Not to you.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.210
Grateful I finally told the truth.

39:41.337 --> 39:42.546
What about the girl?

39:45.091 --> 39:45.925
No idea.

39:47.009 --> 39:47.927
Disappeared.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.471
Nobody disappears anymore.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.974
We're all a blinking blue dot
on someone's screen.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.687
All right, well, I gotta go.

39:58.687 --> 40:00.106
I gotta go to the laundromat.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.066
All right.

40:05.611 --> 40:06.445
