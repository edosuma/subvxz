WEBVTT

00:01.560 --> 00:03.427
Who is ready to strip?

00:03.429 --> 00:06.596
You see you mean strip wallpaper
at your new house,

00:06.598 --> 00:09.266
but me, myself, I always err
on the side of sexy. (moans)

00:09.268 --> 00:11.101
(wolf whistles)
Okay.

00:11.103 --> 00:12.769
You were up there
a long time, man.

00:12.771 --> 00:14.671
Yeah, I was running out
of imaginary dollar bills.

00:14.673 --> 00:17.107
Right, so we are off
to buy drinking water.

00:17.109 --> 00:20.077
Yes, the water at Jaipur Aviv
tastes like it's been fracked.

00:20.079 --> 00:21.912
See you guys there.

00:21.914 --> 00:24.448
Jaipur Aviv?
Yeah, Schmidt named
their house Jaipur Aviv

00:24.450 --> 00:26.650
to celebrate the union
of India and Israel

00:26.652 --> 00:28.085
that their marriage represents.

00:28.087 --> 00:30.087
So this is the future,

00:30.089 --> 00:31.488
the three of us.

00:31.490 --> 00:32.856
Do we need a name?
The winners.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.825
Winston and the Cuties.
Eh, I don't think
we need a name.

00:34.827 --> 00:37.027
But we do need a fourth
roommate, because I think...

00:37.029 --> 00:38.295
Oh, my God!

00:38.297 --> 00:40.497
This loft is enormous.
Thank you, Winston.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.599
I was going there,
but it was gonna be a long walk.

00:42.601 --> 00:45.469
This place is<i> way</i> too
big for three people.

00:45.471 --> 00:46.703
What about your dream
of having an in-loft

00:46.705 --> 00:47.704
multipurpose room?
Multipurpose rooms

00:47.706 --> 00:49.139
can't pay rent.

00:49.141 --> 00:50.273
That's the only purpose
they don't serve.

00:50.275 --> 00:52.142
So let's get a roommate.
Well,

00:52.144 --> 00:54.011
Cece and Schmidt'll
be here another six months,

00:54.013 --> 00:55.645
so we have time
to find someone we like.

00:55.647 --> 00:58.115
Someone... who's a girl.

00:58.117 --> 00:59.282
A girl, hmm.

00:59.284 --> 01:00.517
Winston, thoughts?

01:00.519 --> 01:02.285
Hmm? I'm in.

01:02.287 --> 01:05.188
I'm sorry. I was just distracted
by how<i> big</i> this loft is.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.456
First time you ever
thought about it?

01:06.458 --> 01:07.824
I'm gonna go look for echoes.

01:07.826 --> 01:09.292
¶ ¶

01:09.294 --> 01:10.527
WINSTON:
Hello.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.829
Hello.
WINSTON: Oh, my God!

01:12.831 --> 01:14.331
You guys hearing this?

01:14.333 --> 01:15.832
You guys hearing this?
Ha! Oh, my God!

01:15.834 --> 01:17.300
Stop. He'll go all day.

01:17.302 --> 01:19.369
¶ ¶

01:22.474 --> 01:24.141
Hello, wall.

01:24.143 --> 01:26.209
Prepare to be naked.

01:28.347 --> 01:31.081
Hey.
Oh, hey.

01:31.083 --> 01:32.315
What do you think about Reagan?

01:32.317 --> 01:34.251
Well, she's great.
A-plus posture.

01:34.253 --> 01:36.319
I mean she's moving
to L.A. next month.

01:36.321 --> 01:38.155
What do you think about
Reagan as our roommate?

01:38.157 --> 01:40.724
'Cause she would live in my
room, but she'd still pay rent.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.726
And then you could have
that multipurpose room

01:42.728 --> 01:44.327
where you could shower and cook.

01:44.329 --> 01:46.696
Well, I'd still use
the bathroom and the kitchen

01:46.698 --> 01:50.200
for showering and cooking, but I
would use the multipurpose room

01:50.202 --> 01:51.234
for everything else,
(chuckles)

01:51.236 --> 01:52.502
and I'd be living
across the hall

01:52.504 --> 01:54.938
from my ex and
his new girlfriend.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.908
Not sure why I said
those two in the same tone.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.743
You know what, forget it
actually. I-I... That's on me.
Wait, wait,

01:59.745 --> 02:02.212
wait, wait, wait.
I didn't think of the
ex-girlfriend thing. Forget it.

02:02.214 --> 02:03.914
She's a girl who we like,

02:03.916 --> 02:05.182
and she's lived there before.
I know.

02:05.184 --> 02:06.583
And then that gets us
out of the whole

02:06.585 --> 02:08.518
"Here's what you need to know
about Winston" conversation.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.220
That's always a long weekend.
I know.

02:10.222 --> 02:12.556
She<i> would</i> overlap
with Schmidt and Cece.

02:12.558 --> 02:15.258
And six people is a violation
of the loft agreement.

02:15.260 --> 02:18.462
But loft agreements
are reached to be amended.

02:18.464 --> 02:20.931
So you're really okay with this?
Yes.

02:20.933 --> 02:23.300
I mean, that's how a normal
person would say yes.

02:23.302 --> 02:25.469
I need the trademark
Jessica Day yes.

02:25.471 --> 02:27.370
Yes!
Okay, that's a
little bit too much.

02:27.372 --> 02:28.972
I think it's got to be
somewhere in the middle.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.107
Ye-Yes.

02:30.109 --> 02:32.309
Great.
(chuckles)

02:32.311 --> 02:34.211
Yeah.

02:34.213 --> 02:38.315
You know, there is something so
familiar about this room.

02:38.317 --> 02:40.851
I don't know. It's like
I've been here before.

02:43.555 --> 02:44.921
(sighing):
Wow...

02:44.923 --> 02:45.922
CECE:
Babe,

02:45.924 --> 02:47.324
I know you were
planning on doing

02:47.326 --> 02:49.326
all of the heavy lifting
when it comes to decorating...

02:49.328 --> 02:51.295
Interior design.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.263
Cece, this is a home.
It's not a Christmas cookie.

02:53.265 --> 02:54.498
So you've said.
But this is our

02:54.500 --> 02:57.400
first joint venture,
and I really want to help.

02:57.402 --> 02:58.735
The only thing better
than realizing

02:58.737 --> 03:01.338
my interior design vision
will be realizing

03:01.340 --> 03:03.406
<i>our</i> interior design vision.

03:03.408 --> 03:06.343
Great. Okay, so this
is what I'm seeing...

03:06.345 --> 03:07.744
A boar's head over the fireplace

03:07.746 --> 03:10.413
with a decorative
pedestal backing.

03:10.415 --> 03:12.449
Or...
How did I know that?

03:12.451 --> 03:15.452
This color for our bathroom.

03:15.454 --> 03:17.787
What do you think?
I love it.

03:17.789 --> 03:20.790
You do? Because I know that our
tastes haven't always jived.

03:20.792 --> 03:22.726
(doorbell playing
"La Cucaracha")

03:23.862 --> 03:26.363
You think that we're
greeting people in our home

03:26.365 --> 03:28.165
to "La Cucaracha"!

03:28.167 --> 03:31.434
This is the paint swatch choice
of a serious interior designer.

03:31.436 --> 03:33.370
You should save that
for when we renew our vows.

03:33.372 --> 03:34.604
I love you.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.208
Bathroom's going
to look<i> great.</i>

03:38.210 --> 03:40.310
Huh, that's a pretty color.

03:40.312 --> 03:42.012
Ooh-ee, yes, it is.

03:42.014 --> 03:44.047
For a Third World
doctor's office.

03:44.049 --> 03:45.682
I love this.
What is this, yellow?

03:45.684 --> 03:49.452
Six words you never get to hear:
Nick is calling a loft meeting.

03:49.454 --> 03:52.789
I call to order
this off-site loft meeting.

03:52.791 --> 03:53.890
Nick, you have the floor.

03:53.892 --> 03:57.027
I propose Reagan
move into the loft.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.295
She is a...

03:58.297 --> 04:00.964
likable girl who is not Coach.

04:02.334 --> 04:04.501
Thank you very much
for your time.

04:04.503 --> 04:05.902
As cosponsor of this bill,

04:05.904 --> 04:08.872
it has my full
and unconditional support.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.141
Full and unconditional support.

04:11.143 --> 04:12.309
Today, we will
vote to amend

04:12.311 --> 04:14.678
the No More Than Five
Damn People May Live

04:14.680 --> 04:16.313
in This Loft
at Any One Time Act.

04:16.315 --> 04:18.248
Formerly the No More Than

04:18.250 --> 04:21.051
Four Damn People May Live in
This Loft at Any One Time Act.

04:21.053 --> 04:22.319
We will be voting
as is our custom

04:22.321 --> 04:25.322
by secret ballot.
The vote must be unanimous.

04:25.324 --> 04:26.723
What'd you write?

04:26.725 --> 04:28.325
Shh.

04:30.495 --> 04:32.662
Okay.

04:32.664 --> 04:34.097
Three yays, two nays?

04:34.099 --> 04:35.265
What?

04:35.267 --> 04:36.533
What the hell?!

04:36.535 --> 04:38.435
Even after my speech?

04:41.540 --> 04:44.341
(loud buzzing)

04:44.343 --> 04:47.277
I really thought
this was gonna cheer me up.

04:47.279 --> 04:48.878
JESS: Nick.
(turns off sander)

04:48.880 --> 04:51.047
I swear I voted yay.
I know.

04:51.049 --> 04:52.282
And it means a lot to me,

04:52.284 --> 04:54.050
because I really want
her to move in.

04:54.052 --> 04:56.353
But I don't have the votes.
What can you do?

04:56.355 --> 04:58.421
You're only short two votes.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.523
I can get you two votes.
You can do that?

05:00.525 --> 05:03.093
Can a shark ruin
a family vacation?
No.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.761
I mean if it bites someone.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.896
Maybe, then yeah.

05:06.898 --> 05:09.099
Maybe?
It depends on the
vacation, but yeah.

05:09.101 --> 05:10.433
Can a puppy make a baby smile?

05:10.435 --> 05:11.701
I mean,
there's a lot of factors.

05:11.703 --> 05:13.470
Just...
Depends on...

05:13.472 --> 05:15.438
Thanks for helping
is what I meant to say.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.077
So the two votes
against Reagan

05:21.079 --> 05:22.946
moving in must be
Schmidt and Winston.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.080
Thank God
you had these magnets.

05:24.082 --> 05:25.548
Yeah, well they're a
backup housewarming gift

05:25.550 --> 05:28.885
for Schmidt and Cece in case
my quilt guy screws me again.

05:28.887 --> 05:31.755
Thank God<i> you</i> found this
mysteriously sticky wall.

05:31.757 --> 05:34.090
Let's go get Schmidt and Winston
and change their votes.

05:34.092 --> 05:35.492
I can't believe those two.

05:35.494 --> 05:36.393
You stay here and wait.
I can't.

05:36.395 --> 05:37.394
I'm going too crazy.

05:37.396 --> 05:38.395
I'm coming with you.
Nick,

05:38.397 --> 05:40.130
you're way too invested.
Plus, it's tacky

05:40.132 --> 05:41.431
to whip your own votes.

05:41.433 --> 05:43.667
We both know that never
works with these guys.

05:43.669 --> 05:45.769
Schmidt, Winston...

05:45.771 --> 05:47.103
prepare to be buttonholed.

05:47.105 --> 05:48.605
Did you just say "buttonholed"?

05:48.607 --> 05:51.675
I mean whatever you got
to do, Jess, but<i> gross.</i>

05:51.677 --> 05:54.477
(sighs)
It's only one room, one flaw.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.779
Every beautiful thing
has one flaw.

05:55.781 --> 05:58.515
Marilyn Monroe
has her beauty mark.

05:58.517 --> 06:01.518
"Thriller" has
its Vincent Price poem.
CECE: Babe.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.988
(exhales)
Do you like this ceiling fan?

06:04.990 --> 06:07.457
Wicker... wicker blades!
They are made

06:07.459 --> 06:08.792
from reclaimed hampers.

06:08.794 --> 06:11.027
It's like a dirty laundry
propeller above our bed.

06:11.029 --> 06:12.128
(laughing):
Yes.
Okay!

06:12.130 --> 06:13.129
(sighs)

06:13.131 --> 06:15.165
I love that we're
on the same page.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.499
That's right.

06:17.436 --> 06:19.969
Two flaws. Okay. Two flaws.

06:19.971 --> 06:22.272
No beautiful thing
has two flaws, only ugly things.

06:22.274 --> 06:24.474
It's spreading.
(gasps)

06:24.476 --> 06:26.643
Thank you, Winston.
Now I feel validated.
No, no, no, no.

06:26.645 --> 06:29.279
I just figured out
why I know this house.

06:29.281 --> 06:32.382
You see, it's in my favorite...

06:33.652 --> 06:36.286
...school district.

06:36.288 --> 06:38.788
That's nice.
Yeah.

06:38.790 --> 06:40.657
Hey, Nick.

06:40.659 --> 06:42.625
Sorry about the vote.
I don't want to talk about it.

06:42.627 --> 06:44.227
Cool. I need your help
with a situation.

06:44.229 --> 06:46.396
There is no situation
you could possibly describe

06:46.398 --> 06:48.865
compelling enough to get me
to want to help you.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.533
Schmidt and Cece's house
was the location

06:50.535 --> 06:54.371
for the 1971 pornographic film,
<i> Daddy's Longleg.</i>

06:54.373 --> 06:56.072
Okay, maybe
there's one situation.

06:56.074 --> 06:58.241
I'm 100% in.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.876
That piece is exquisite.
NICK: Oh!

06:59.878 --> 07:01.644
May I see it from another angle?

07:01.646 --> 07:03.480
WOMAN: He was my best friend...
(chuckling)

07:03.482 --> 07:05.415
until he became my enemy.
WINSTON: The boar goes up,

07:05.417 --> 07:07.417
and the robe comes... down.

07:07.419 --> 07:09.018
That's porn.

07:09.020 --> 07:11.087
You got this on
a heavy rotation.
Super heavy rotation.

07:11.089 --> 07:12.489
Please don't dance
while we're watching

07:12.491 --> 07:13.757
porn videos together.
Oh, sorry about that.

07:13.759 --> 07:16.493
But I mean this is Schmidt
and Cece's fireplace, right?

07:16.495 --> 07:17.861
It looks like it, doesn't it?

07:17.863 --> 07:20.597
But if it is, he can never know.

07:20.599 --> 07:22.065
(quietly):
Oh, come on...
You know that.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.066
Nick.
He can never know.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.234
Yes, but we're already keeping

07:24.236 --> 07:26.503
five secrets from him.
The secret vault is full.

07:26.505 --> 07:28.004
That's not true. We only have
four. We have a slot open.

07:28.006 --> 07:29.239
You always forget.

07:29.241 --> 07:30.273
Lost umbrella.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.574
I forgot about lost umbrella.
Mm.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.610
I always forget
about lost umbrella.

07:33.612 --> 07:34.778
(chuckling):
That's why it was lost.

07:34.780 --> 07:37.213
So we're at maximum capacity.
So what do we do?

07:37.215 --> 07:39.682
Okay, so pornographic house
has to go into the vault.

07:39.684 --> 07:41.918
Agreed.
So what do we declassify?

07:41.920 --> 07:44.721
Jalapeño 19?
Jalapeño 19? No way.

07:44.723 --> 07:48.358
Uh... Duck, Duck, Gavin?
Oh, Duck, Duck, Gavin
has to stay a secret.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.726
I would love to keep
Upper Deck Timeshare

07:49.728 --> 07:52.095
between us
and the guy we paid off.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.531
There are no good options.
Are you sure this is the house?

07:54.533 --> 07:57.700
I think so, but maybe not.
Okay, so here's what
we're gonna do.

07:57.702 --> 07:58.902
I'm going to watch with fresh
eyes and I'm gonna see

07:58.904 --> 08:01.571
what my gut tells me, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:01.573 --> 08:03.540
You go around the house,
you take photos...
Mm-hmm.

08:03.542 --> 08:05.092
for comparison.
Yes.

08:05.093 --> 08:06.643
We'll look at all the pics,
we'll come back here later,

08:06.645 --> 08:08.611
Mm-hmm.
then we'll make a...
you know, our final call.

08:08.613 --> 08:09.946
Boom.
(chuckles)

08:09.948 --> 08:11.648
I need the phone for pictures.
I need it to watch the porn.

08:11.650 --> 08:13.817
Use your phone.
It already started buffering.
It's two minutes in.

08:13.819 --> 08:16.453
(quietly): It's buffering.
Take mine... and take
pictures with that.

08:16.455 --> 08:17.654
Makes sense.
It's very smart,

08:17.656 --> 08:19.823
and<i> that</i> is why
we are The Keepers

08:19.825 --> 08:22.058
of the Five Secrets.
Keepers of the Five Secrets.

08:22.060 --> 08:24.127
(Chinese flute music playing)

08:27.933 --> 08:29.833
Shh.
(whispers):
Don't say a word.

08:29.835 --> 08:31.634
(groans)

08:31.636 --> 08:33.636
(sighs)

08:33.638 --> 08:35.171
Gah!

08:35.173 --> 08:37.073
Secret ballots are
<i> never really</i> secret.

08:37.075 --> 08:38.141
You know that, right?

08:38.143 --> 08:39.676
Okay fine.
You got me.

08:39.678 --> 08:40.844
I voted nay.

08:40.846 --> 08:42.779
It would just be six
people for too long.

08:42.781 --> 08:44.514
We would continue to be a
married couple living with

08:44.516 --> 08:45.782
three roommates.

08:45.784 --> 08:47.917
You want to make
it four, increasing

08:47.919 --> 08:50.987
our humiliation by 33%.

08:50.989 --> 08:54.123
Mr. Miller has no interest
in seeing you humiliated.

08:54.125 --> 08:58.127
And as such, I've been empowered
to offer you the following.

08:58.129 --> 08:59.796
I'm listening.

08:59.798 --> 09:01.631
As a symbolic gesture,

09:01.633 --> 09:04.601
Reagan cannot list the loft
as her official residence.

09:04.603 --> 09:07.203
Where will her mail go?
A P.O. Box.

09:07.205 --> 09:08.771
Oh, yeah.
All right, keep going.

09:08.773 --> 09:10.607
When asked where you live,
you and Reagan

09:10.609 --> 09:11.774
will say the following.

09:11.776 --> 09:13.042
"Geez, beats us.

09:13.044 --> 09:15.345
"We're just dumb kids living
paycheck to paycheck.

09:15.347 --> 09:18.214
"Thank gosh for our upwardly
mobile friends Schmidt and Cece,

09:18.216 --> 09:20.450
"and the three guest rooms
in their loft.

09:20.452 --> 09:22.552
"We're crashing with them
until we get our lives together

09:22.554 --> 09:24.621
and we remain there
at their pleasure."

09:24.623 --> 09:25.555
Do I have to memorize all that?
No,

09:25.557 --> 09:27.557
you can just read it
from the toilet paper.

09:27.559 --> 09:29.092
(sighs)
And finally...

09:30.996 --> 09:34.464
...you will allow Schmidt
to buy you one pair of jeans.

09:34.466 --> 09:35.832
Oh, he's serious.

09:35.834 --> 09:38.034
¶ ¶

09:42.173 --> 09:43.640
Hey, Jess.

09:43.642 --> 09:45.808
Did Schmidt tell you
I was gonna be in here?

09:45.810 --> 09:47.010
No.

09:47.012 --> 09:48.645
Then how come you
didn't get scared?

09:48.647 --> 09:50.680
Before I enter any bathroom,

09:50.682 --> 09:52.749
I take a moment
to myself and say,

09:52.751 --> 09:55.018
"No matter what
happens in there,

09:55.020 --> 09:57.420
don't get scared."

09:57.422 --> 09:58.755
And it works, you know,

09:58.757 --> 10:01.124
except for that one time
when I was at the Cubs...

10:02.761 --> 10:05.395
Okay Jess, don't move.

10:05.397 --> 10:06.429
What's happening?
Don't worry about it.

10:06.431 --> 10:07.830
Hey, do me a favor.

10:07.832 --> 10:09.832
Put an arch
in your back, just...

10:09.834 --> 10:10.934
(clicks)
Got it.

10:10.936 --> 10:12.835
Okay. Let's take one together.

10:12.837 --> 10:14.604
Oh, like a prom picture.
Yeah, kind of.

10:14.606 --> 10:16.239
(strains): Here we...
(clicking)

10:16.241 --> 10:18.074
Got it.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.375
I actually might need

10:19.377 --> 10:21.844
to retake that. I think my eyes
were closed. But first,

10:21.846 --> 10:25.448
let me see if any of this pork
makes your tummy rumble.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.083
Winston would like you
and Reagan to spend

10:27.085 --> 10:30.386
a mutually agreed upon amount of
time as a couple with Ferguson.

10:30.388 --> 10:31.788
We're talking about the cat?

10:31.790 --> 10:34.424
The only couples that Ferguson
knows are interracial.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.793
And while Winston views this
as progress, he knows

10:36.795 --> 10:40.063
that it's not an accurate
portrayal of... the world.

10:40.065 --> 10:41.631
You even think that cat
knows Winston exists?

10:41.633 --> 10:43.766
Definitely not. Next,
Winston would like to be

10:43.768 --> 10:46.235
the first person to see you
in your new jeans.

10:46.237 --> 10:47.971
And he will see you
under these circumstances,

10:47.973 --> 10:49.806
and these circumstances only:

10:49.808 --> 10:52.609
descending a grand
spiral staircase,

10:52.611 --> 10:54.711
as Winston waits at the bottom,

10:54.713 --> 10:57.046
weeping with pride,
holding your new belt.

10:57.048 --> 10:59.415
He wants me to go
upstairs without a belt.

10:59.417 --> 11:01.618
Some... We rent a
really nice mansion.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.286
Hey, you could do it,
like, a museum...

11:03.288 --> 11:04.821
I'm not going
to a public place

11:04.823 --> 11:05.655
and doing this with him.

11:05.657 --> 11:07.423
Do you want
the yays or not?

11:07.425 --> 11:08.992
I need the yays.

11:10.095 --> 11:12.228
The motion on the floor
is the same,

11:12.230 --> 11:14.831
with some riders,
most notably

11:14.833 --> 11:16.966
the Furguson Bishop,
White Immersion Program.

11:20.739 --> 11:24.240
Um, four yays, one nay?

11:24.242 --> 11:26.576
Who's this nay?
I asked you what you wanted.

11:26.578 --> 11:28.011
And I voted yay.

11:28.013 --> 11:29.278
That was about
the vote?

11:29.280 --> 11:31.514
I thought y'all just wanted
to get to know me better.

11:31.516 --> 11:32.949
I was already a yay.

11:32.951 --> 11:35.151
Well, that's everybody.
Who's left?

11:36.154 --> 11:39.222
Parikh,
prepare to be buttonholed.

11:43.795 --> 11:45.595
I'm sorry I took
your yay for granted.

11:45.597 --> 11:46.963
Let me wet your beak a little
bit-- you want sink time,

11:46.965 --> 11:49.165
you want fridge space,
you want Schmidt and Winston

11:49.167 --> 11:51.534
to let you in on
this whole jeans thing?

11:51.536 --> 11:52.835
No, I don't want
anything, okay.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.805
I voted nay because
I'm trying to protect you.

11:55.807 --> 11:58.341
From who?
From you, you lunatic.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.809
You were being
a good friend to Nick

11:59.811 --> 12:01.310
by letting Reagan move in,
but I wouldn't be

12:01.312 --> 12:03.980
a good friend to you
if I just let that happen.

12:03.982 --> 12:05.381
If Nick wants Reagan
to move in,

12:05.383 --> 12:06.849
then I want Reagan
to move in.

12:06.851 --> 12:10.053
I mean, I don't<i> want</i> her to
move in, but I... I support it.

12:10.055 --> 12:12.121
You can support something
without being the poster child

12:12.123 --> 12:14.724
for it, okay, so just maybe
take a step back.

12:14.726 --> 12:16.893
I can't do that, because
my love for Nick exists,

12:16.895 --> 12:18.161
so it has to
come out somewhere.

12:18.163 --> 12:19.996
If you put water
in Bugs Bunny's hole,

12:19.998 --> 12:22.699
it's gonna shoot out
some other hole

12:22.701 --> 12:24.801
where Elmer Fudd
least expects it.

12:24.803 --> 12:26.969
Is this other hole
friendship?

12:26.971 --> 12:29.572
Exactly. So I can't express
my feelings for Nick

12:29.574 --> 12:31.374
through my romance hole,

12:31.376 --> 12:34.911
so I need to express them
through my friendship hole.

12:34.913 --> 12:37.747
And I really regret
hitching my wagon to "hole."

12:37.749 --> 12:39.982
But you...
you get it, okay?

12:39.984 --> 12:43.586
I want you to know
I'm gonna be fine, okay?

12:43.588 --> 12:46.589
You promise?
I promise.

12:46.591 --> 12:49.559
Okay, all right,
I'll vote yay.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.528
<i>If</i> Nick and Reagan
aren't physical

12:52.530 --> 12:54.363
outside of their room.

12:54.365 --> 12:56.165
I'm sorry, but I have
to protect you a little,

12:56.167 --> 12:57.233
okay, so just deal with it.

12:57.235 --> 13:00.336
That's a really
great rider, Cece.

13:00.338 --> 13:01.771
You see, I think
this is the tub

13:01.773 --> 13:04.841
where Daddy bathes
the Soviet dissident.

13:04.843 --> 13:06.776
And this has to be
the window seat

13:06.778 --> 13:08.411
where he spanks
the Aztec twins.

13:08.413 --> 13:12.782
Hey, side note, thank you for
voting yay on the Reagan vote.

13:12.784 --> 13:14.784
I really want her to move in.
I think I'm ready for this.

13:14.786 --> 13:17.854
She will, and you are
very much so ready.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.224
Yeah. Yeah.

13:21.226 --> 13:22.959
So many close-ups.
It's so frustrating.

13:22.961 --> 13:25.061
I mean, for our
purposes of today.

13:25.063 --> 13:26.963
You know, mostly when they
cut to wide I'm thinking

13:26.965 --> 13:28.397
why the hell are you
showing me the room?

13:28.399 --> 13:29.766
But now I want
to see the room.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.033
I don't want to
see the close-ups.

13:31.035 --> 13:32.702
Well, there's only
one thing left.

13:32.704 --> 13:33.770
(phone chimes)

13:33.772 --> 13:35.972
Search the locations
manager

13:35.974 --> 13:39.609
for the 1971 adult film
<i>Daddy's Longleg.</i>

13:39.611 --> 13:40.710
Very smart.

13:40.712 --> 13:41.778
(chimes)
SEARCH VOICE: Searching now.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.781
(Chinese flute music playing)

13:44.783 --> 13:46.649
Secrets.
Secrets.

13:46.651 --> 13:48.785
Cece, this is
the hardest thing

13:48.787 --> 13:50.052
that I've ever had
to say to you.

13:50.054 --> 13:53.289
I had always assumed
that when you got serious

13:53.291 --> 13:54.891
about interior design,

13:54.893 --> 13:57.493
I was going to love
your ideas.

13:57.495 --> 13:59.428
Because I love you.

13:59.430 --> 14:00.897
I hate your ideas.

14:00.899 --> 14:02.832
I hate them almost
as much as I love you,

14:02.834 --> 14:05.234
which is so much.
I have to stop you
right there.

14:05.236 --> 14:07.637
I appreciate the fact that
you are a very dramatic man,

14:07.639 --> 14:10.006
but the next time
you start a conversation

14:10.008 --> 14:12.842
with, "This is the hardest
thing that I have<i> ever</i>

14:12.844 --> 14:15.645
had to say to you,"
it better end with,

14:15.647 --> 14:18.314
"I'm gay now,"
"I found a lump in my nut,"

14:18.316 --> 14:19.949
or, "He came out of nowhere,

14:19.951 --> 14:21.751
help me get the blood
off of my car."

14:21.753 --> 14:23.853
I can't live in a house
that you don't love.

14:23.855 --> 14:26.923
And I also can't live
in a house of<i> horrors!</i>

14:26.925 --> 14:28.191
Thank you for
taking my note

14:28.193 --> 14:29.759
about being dramatic.

14:29.761 --> 14:31.961
Next time you don't like

14:31.963 --> 14:33.696
one of my suggestions,
just tell me.

14:33.698 --> 14:34.931
I don't like your suggestions.

14:34.933 --> 14:36.632
Okay, well, then you
suggest something,

14:36.634 --> 14:37.934
and then I suggest something,

14:37.936 --> 14:39.936
and eventually we
reach a compromise.

14:39.938 --> 14:42.004
So let's try it.
Let's try it

14:42.006 --> 14:43.773
with the cabinets.

14:43.775 --> 14:47.276
I suggest a lighter wood,
like birch.

14:47.278 --> 14:48.344
Absolutely not.

14:50.782 --> 14:52.014
I mean...
(clears throat)
Mm-hmm.

14:52.016 --> 14:55.551
I suggest a darker wood,
like walnut.

14:55.553 --> 14:57.887
So now we try to find
something in the middle,

14:57.889 --> 14:59.956
like, how about oak?

14:59.958 --> 15:02.058
That's fine, that's fine,
I'm willing to go darker.

15:02.060 --> 15:04.861
Cherry? Mahogany?

15:04.863 --> 15:06.729
Walnut?
I love that suggestion!

15:06.731 --> 15:08.965
It was your suggestion.
It's not a compromise.

15:08.967 --> 15:10.333
Okay, fine, birch.
No!

15:10.335 --> 15:12.535
That was<i> my</i> suggestion.
That's still not a compromise.

15:12.537 --> 15:13.970
Now you're confusing me!

15:13.972 --> 15:15.972
JESS (shouting):
Emergency off-site loft meeting!

15:15.974 --> 15:18.808
JESS: Nick. Nick,
it's time for the final vote.

15:18.810 --> 15:20.810
Where are you?

15:22.080 --> 15:24.146
The motion now includes
the Cece Parikh

15:24.148 --> 15:25.414
Hallway Decency Act.

15:28.319 --> 15:31.921
Ugh! There's still
one nay in here!

15:31.923 --> 15:33.556
Okay, I voted yay, I swear.
Then who was it?

15:33.558 --> 15:34.924
WOMAN (on phone):
Roughstuff Productions.

15:34.926 --> 15:37.593
You have a real guilty look
on your face-- a real nay face.

15:37.595 --> 15:39.161
This is not my nay face.
This is...

15:39.163 --> 15:41.163
This is how does a man
compromise his vision face.

15:41.165 --> 15:42.598
MAN (on phone):
Roughstuff Productions,
this is Clem.

15:42.600 --> 15:46.168
Uh, yeah, Clem, um. I'm calling
about the whereabou--

15:46.170 --> 15:47.370
(grunting)
Winston!

15:47.372 --> 15:49.105
CLEM:
Sir, are you auditioning?
Admit it!

15:49.107 --> 15:52.508
Why?
Oh... Aah...

15:52.510 --> 15:54.176
Why?
It doesn't matter
who voted nay.

15:54.178 --> 15:55.344
The message is clear,

15:55.346 --> 15:56.746
somebody doesn't want Reagan
in the loft.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.514
So who cares who did it?
Let's move on.

15:58.516 --> 16:00.750
Who is that person?
I hate that person.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.919
Also, maybe somebody realized
moments before the vote

16:02.921 --> 16:04.954
that, if you think about it,
my bed...

16:04.956 --> 16:06.756
it-it tilts west.

16:06.758 --> 16:09.292
And so she could roll off the
bed in the middle of the night,

16:09.294 --> 16:12.128
and on the floor,
and my floor tilts east...
Nick.

16:12.130 --> 16:14.430
Which means she could
roll under my bed

16:14.432 --> 16:15.932
and be lost forever.

16:15.934 --> 16:18.134
Did you vote nay?
Yeah, of course I did.

16:18.136 --> 16:21.203
I don't know what I want.
I'm confused.

16:21.205 --> 16:24.640
Ooh-whee!
Politics!

16:29.147 --> 16:30.980
Schmidt, you need to take
these design blinders off

16:30.982 --> 16:32.748
and look around.

16:32.750 --> 16:35.418
We compromise
all the time.

16:35.420 --> 16:37.954
We named our house
Jaipur Aviv.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.956
That's right.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.791
I wanted to call it
Ghatak/Mossad HQ,

16:41.793 --> 16:43.960
and you wanted
to call it... Our House.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.161
Our House, yes.

16:45.163 --> 16:46.963
We met in the middle
and we called it Jaipur Aviv.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.164
You know what,
every compromise

16:48.166 --> 16:50.166
doesn't have to be 50-50.

16:50.168 --> 16:52.068
I've been looking
at cabinets online.

16:52.070 --> 16:55.071
They all look exactly
the same to me.

16:55.073 --> 16:56.639
No, they don't.
They really do.

16:56.641 --> 17:00.810
Birch, walnut, mahogany,
fiberglass, stainless steel.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.278
You can't tell the difference
between metal and wood?

17:02.280 --> 17:03.813
Not when it comes
to a cabinet.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.281
I just see cabinet,
and then I go, like,

17:05.283 --> 17:06.682
"Oh, my plate's in there."

17:06.684 --> 17:08.617
I think this is a bigger issue
than interior design.

17:08.619 --> 17:10.119
I think it just
applies to cabinets.

17:10.121 --> 17:12.488
And I accept the fact
that I am not good

17:12.490 --> 17:14.357
at interior design,

17:14.359 --> 17:16.158
and you're brilliant at it.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.694
So you should take
the lead on that.

17:18.696 --> 17:20.696
Just like I'm no good
at cooking Indian food.

17:20.698 --> 17:22.698
Mm.
You take the lead
on that.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.300
You always let me
make dessert.

17:24.302 --> 17:25.935
I always burn it.

17:25.937 --> 17:27.703
I just want you
to feel included.

17:27.705 --> 17:30.172
Even if it's in just some
small, symbolic way.

17:34.679 --> 17:38.047
(doorbell plays "La Cucaracha")

17:38.049 --> 17:39.582
(melody repeats)

17:41.519 --> 17:44.820
(melody repeats)

17:44.822 --> 17:46.222
Okay.

17:47.225 --> 17:48.624
Hey.

17:48.626 --> 17:50.059
Do you know how
<i> anything</i> works?

17:50.061 --> 17:52.228
I know you whipped
and you buttonholed

17:52.230 --> 17:53.829
and you swing-setted
your tail off

17:53.831 --> 17:54.964
to get all these votes.

17:54.966 --> 17:56.232
Who did I swing-set?

17:56.234 --> 17:57.833
Once I got the votes,
I panicked.

17:57.835 --> 18:00.136
Because I realized that
now I have to ask her,

18:00.138 --> 18:01.137
and what if she says no?

18:01.139 --> 18:03.706
Or worse, what if
she says yes,

18:03.708 --> 18:05.341
moves in with me,
and then regrets it?

18:05.343 --> 18:06.342
I wish we'd had
this conversation

18:06.344 --> 18:07.510
at the beginning
of the day,

18:07.512 --> 18:10.146
but yeah, I mean,
I get it, it's scary.

18:10.148 --> 18:12.314
Well, tell me I'm wrong
to be scared.

18:12.316 --> 18:13.516
You know, tell me
I should vote yay.

18:13.518 --> 18:15.551
Nick, I whipped
everyone's votes.

18:15.553 --> 18:18.087
I'm not gonna
whip yours.

18:18.089 --> 18:20.156
But whatever you decide,
I support you.

18:22.260 --> 18:23.325
We all do.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.501
If I vote yay,
all that means is

18:32.503 --> 18:34.703
is that I<i> can</i> ask her.

18:34.705 --> 18:36.238
Emphasis on "can."

18:36.240 --> 18:39.075
And that I don't<i> have</i> to.
Emphasis on<i> "have."</i>

18:39.077 --> 18:41.177
Wow. Well, no one loves
parsing more than I do,

18:41.179 --> 18:42.912
and even I
find this tedious,

18:42.914 --> 18:44.847
but... yes.

18:46.584 --> 18:47.683
All right, slide me over.

18:47.685 --> 18:50.186
Okay.
Okay.

18:51.689 --> 18:53.956
Whoa, is this wall
just sticky,

18:53.958 --> 18:57.359
or is it... magnetic?

19:00.131 --> 19:02.364
We have got to get
a magnetic wall.

19:02.366 --> 19:04.300
We will never buy
another coil of wires

19:04.302 --> 19:06.202
connected to a battery
again in our lives.

19:06.204 --> 19:08.804
It'll pay for itself
in a week. (scoffs)

19:27.158 --> 19:30.159
<i> (Daddy's Longleg</i> playing
over phone)

19:30.161 --> 19:33.562
Okay, Roughstuff
Productions referred me

19:33.564 --> 19:37.133
to their former subsidiary
Tick Tock Erotica, LLC,

19:37.135 --> 19:39.335
which split from Roughstuff
back in '09.

19:39.337 --> 19:40.836
But here's the thing.

19:40.838 --> 19:43.339
Tick Tock is
in the App space now,

19:43.341 --> 19:47.076
but they still use
the same headhunter.

19:47.078 --> 19:50.012
And<i> they</i> still had
the number

19:50.014 --> 19:53.849
for a Mr. Mort Capaco,
locations manager,

19:53.851 --> 19:55.184
<i> Daddy's Longleg.</i>

19:55.186 --> 19:58.154
Did he know where
they shot it?
He did not.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.255
All right, we've got to
give up a secret.

19:59.257 --> 20:00.823
The only question is
who breaks the news.

20:00.825 --> 20:03.159
I'll break the news if
I get to pick the secret.

20:03.161 --> 20:06.662
Deal. But I really recommend
that you tell him about

20:06.664 --> 20:08.264
BOTH:
...Halloween 2004.

20:08.266 --> 20:09.665
That's what I was
gonna say.

20:11.369 --> 20:13.269
(Chinese flute music playing)

20:13.271 --> 20:16.672
Secrets exchanged.
Secrets exchanged.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.674
Shh.

20:18.676 --> 20:20.009
WOMAN (over phone):
I could never say no to the man

20:20.011 --> 20:21.677
that saved my sled dogs.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.746
(porn music playing)

20:29.987 --> 20:32.288
Schmidt, I need
to tell you something

20:32.290 --> 20:35.057
unpleasant about
some candy you ate.
(door opens, closes)

20:35.059 --> 20:36.058
What?
Many years...

20:36.060 --> 20:37.359
It was shot in Seattle.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.795
<i> Daddy's Longleg</i> was
shot in Seattle.

20:39.797 --> 20:40.996
What's<i> Daddy's Longleg?</i>

20:40.998 --> 20:42.398
A pornographic movie
Winston and I really like.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.300
You don't have
to worry about it.
Because...

20:44.302 --> 20:47.236
it was...<i> not</i> filmed
in your home.

20:47.238 --> 20:48.871
So congratulations!

20:48.873 --> 20:50.673
Wow, we did it, honey.
Was that in question?

20:50.675 --> 20:51.707
Hey, did you ask Reagan?

20:51.709 --> 20:53.209
I've decided to ask her,

20:53.211 --> 20:54.710
but I haven't
asked her yet.

20:54.712 --> 20:55.911
I don't know how to.

20:55.913 --> 20:58.080
All I've got
right now is,

20:58.082 --> 21:00.516
"Hey, Nickname"-- that's what
we're calling each other

21:00.518 --> 21:02.251
until we can think
of something better-- uh,

21:02.253 --> 21:04.253
and after that,
I'm a little stumped.
Well,

21:04.255 --> 21:05.888
why do you want
Reagan to move in?

21:05.890 --> 21:07.489
Because I want to spend
a lot of time with her,

21:07.491 --> 21:08.891
and if she moves in,

21:08.893 --> 21:10.392
I'll be able to spend
more time with her.

21:10.394 --> 21:13.062
Well, if she moved in, how
would that make you feel, Nick?

21:13.064 --> 21:13.662
I'd feel honored.

21:13.664 --> 21:14.897
Honored or happy?

21:14.899 --> 21:16.265
Both.

21:16.267 --> 21:17.866
And what's your name?
My name is Nick.

21:17.868 --> 21:18.934
Probably could've got that
on my own.

21:18.936 --> 21:20.302
Noted.

21:21.672 --> 21:23.372
Wow.

21:23.374 --> 21:24.506
I mean, that's perfect.

21:24.508 --> 21:26.075
And it's already
in my phone.

21:26.077 --> 21:28.510
But there's just some things
I want to agonize over

21:28.512 --> 21:30.679
out loud with you guys.
And send.

21:30.681 --> 21:32.114
I wanted to agonize! I said
I needed to agonize over...

21:32.116 --> 21:34.116
Can we give you money?
That was great.
You're a beautiful man.

21:34.118 --> 21:35.084
God bless you.

21:35.086 --> 21:36.518
WINSTON:
<i> You're welcome, everybody.</i>

21:36.520 --> 21:38.153
JESS:<i> About this porn</i>
<i> you watched together...</i>
