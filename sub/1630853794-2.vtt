WEBVTT

00:19.394 --> 00:22.439
[Dick] Gotham City.
Demons are rising up.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.691
Criminals breathe
in the shadows.

00:24.774 --> 00:27.527
Blood paints the streets
like graffiti.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.821
My home needs Nightwing.

00:31.072 --> 00:33.116
Uh, anyone
want to switch seats?

00:33.199 --> 00:35.285
[theme music playing]

00:38.705 --> 00:40.498
Finally! Hey, next time
we steal an invisible jet,

00:40.582 --> 00:43.209
let's just, like, fly home
before it explodes.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.463
Hello, Alfred.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.840
Looks like the prodigal son
has returned... [grunts]

00:48.923 --> 00:52.844
What up, Gotham City?
You ready to lick off my toes?

00:52.927 --> 00:55.638
Harley and Ivy are back!

00:55.722 --> 00:58.141
That's how you wax poetic,
you fucking dork.

00:58.224 --> 01:00.810
-[Alfred] My word!
-[Harley laughs]

01:00.894 --> 01:03.646
-Hmm.
-I'll grab a cab.

01:05.607 --> 01:10.153
Mmm. Hoda Kotb,
your pantry is beyond
organized.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.989
An oatmeal shelf. I am gagged!

01:13.072 --> 01:16.034
My Meyer lemon tree
is finally producing fruit.

01:16.117 --> 01:18.328
You know, they're not like
regular lemons.

01:18.411 --> 01:21.331
It's that hint of sweetness
that makes all the diff--

01:22.874 --> 01:25.752
Hello, clayfaces
and shark men!

01:25.835 --> 01:27.670
[horn blaring]

01:27.754 --> 01:29.297
[Frank] And me!

01:29.380 --> 01:32.509
I got your cheap
Hudson News-ass
postcard from Paris.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.344
I know you got this shit
at the airport.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.304
Oui, oui, motherfucker!

01:36.387 --> 01:39.224
Oh, you're back! And creating
all kinds of fun new holes
in the wall.

01:39.307 --> 01:44.270
Did you know Mr. Kool-Aid
improved to that style of entry
on the day?

01:44.354 --> 01:46.105
Some talent you cannot teach.

01:46.189 --> 01:49.067
Well, stealing classic
commercial bits are only
the beginning

01:49.150 --> 01:52.987
because now that
the crew's back together,
we got mad plans, yo!

01:53.071 --> 01:55.365
I knew you'd come back
for a giant caper.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.908
So what are we going to do?

01:56.991 --> 01:59.702
Okay, Ivy came up with
the most badass, most genius,

01:59.786 --> 02:02.247
crazy, sexy, cool plan ever!

02:02.330 --> 02:03.540
Well, I...
I wouldn't go that far.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.874
It is so awesome and fucked-up,

02:04.958 --> 02:07.460
it would make Lex Luthor
shit his pants!

02:07.544 --> 02:09.921
That man does not shit
his pants for anything.

02:10.004 --> 02:12.215
Dear heavens, Harley,
tell us what the plan is.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.716
It's Ivy's plan.
You gotta ask her.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.553
I know you guys are used
to me being in charge,

02:16.636 --> 02:19.514
but this is all Ivy,
her time to shine.

02:19.597 --> 02:20.682
Hit it, Ivy.

02:22.141 --> 02:23.977
Oh, yes.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.395
I will hit it

02:25.478 --> 02:28.731
'cause I'm the boss lady,
if you will.

02:28.815 --> 02:32.360
The big honcho,
the top pepperoni. [chuckles]

02:34.153 --> 02:35.488
[clears throat]
You know what, guys?

02:35.572 --> 02:37.448
We just walked in.
I haven't even unpacked.

02:37.532 --> 02:41.119
I smell like a bus.
Can we just talk about
the plan in a little bit?

02:41.202 --> 02:44.539
You are gonna cream
when you hear this plan. Huh.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.917
And once again,
our house is a home.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.420
[suspenseful music playing]

02:51.754 --> 02:54.257
Huh. Feels smaller.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.886
Uh... Why does
this suit have boobs?

02:57.969 --> 03:00.513
If you want to keep that one,
I have a spare in my locker.

03:00.597 --> 03:04.309
This is my alcove,
and you're not Batman.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.685
He wishes, right?

03:07.186 --> 03:10.440
He doesn't wish. I'm Batgirl.

03:10.523 --> 03:14.986
And you're Dick Grayson.
Last of the Flying Graysons,
ward of Bruce Wayne,

03:15.069 --> 03:19.699
the original Robin, Teen Titan,
and now the protector
of Bludhaven.

03:19.782 --> 03:21.743
Nightwing!

03:21.826 --> 03:23.453
Nightwing. Got it.

03:23.536 --> 03:24.704
You were gone for a while.

03:24.787 --> 03:26.831
We had to make some
expansions stick.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.876
Well, I see you've installed
some new darkened corners,
and it's Nightwing.

03:29.959 --> 03:33.129
We're equals.
Not Batman and Robin.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.422
Got that right.

03:34.505 --> 03:36.341
Ah, I thought you were four.

03:36.424 --> 03:39.969
It's been eight years.
That's how time works, dickwad.

03:40.053 --> 03:40.970
What's with your voice?

03:41.054 --> 03:42.096
What are you talking about?

03:42.180 --> 03:43.890
It's a bit overly serious.

03:43.973 --> 03:46.976
I think it's an appropriate
amount of serious.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.270
[alarm beeping]

03:49.354 --> 03:51.522
Firefly's attacking
the Gotham corn factory,

03:51.606 --> 03:55.151
but he's going to see his plan
go up in flames.
To the Batmobile!

03:55.234 --> 03:56.235
Shotgun.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.990
Don't worry.
You can ride with The Macaroni.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.492
Who's The Macaroni?

04:04.327 --> 04:06.371
Your chariot awaits.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.498
Fuck The Macaroni.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.167
[Poison Ivy clears throat]
Good evening. Welcome.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.585
Bienvenue.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.963
Is this an MLM? 'Cause I'm in.

04:15.046 --> 04:18.633
-The dictionary defines
terraforming as...
-[Harley] Ooh, ooh, me!

04:18.716 --> 04:20.510
-Yes?
-You're doing great. [smooches]

04:20.593 --> 04:24.555
Thank you.
So thousands of years ago,
Gotham looked like this.

04:24.639 --> 04:27.225
Before it became
trash like this.

04:27.308 --> 04:31.521
We're going to reanimate
the dead plant matter
underneath the city

04:31.604 --> 04:35.191
and supercharge it
to terraform Gotham into this.

04:35.274 --> 04:39.487
-Well, I'm sold.
-Harls, just hang on a second,
I haven't said the actual plan.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.364
I thought she was finished too.

04:41.447 --> 04:45.451
Now, to terraform this city,
I need to create
the Eden Serum.

04:45.535 --> 04:50.415
But to do that, I need
a compound found only
in prehistoric mosquitoes

04:50.498 --> 04:52.250
that have been trapped in sap.

04:52.333 --> 04:55.128
-Like in Jurassic Park!
-Uh... Yeah.
I mean, I don't... Sure.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.380
-She's never even seen
Jurassic Park!
-[Poison Ivy] Guys...

04:57.463 --> 05:00.466
What? You are missing out
on 60% of my personality.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.886
Why do you think I kept making
Jeff Goldblum references?

05:03.970 --> 05:05.847
The good news is that

05:05.930 --> 05:09.559
our friends over at the
Natural History Museum
have such a mosquito.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.269
Then let us heist!

05:11.352 --> 05:14.897
I call the role of...
[in female voice]
Eleanor St. Cloud.

05:14.981 --> 05:19.694
She's a widowed
archaeologist fresh off
her latest find, love.

05:19.777 --> 05:22.113
Actually, if you go ahead
and pick up your binders,

05:22.196 --> 05:25.241
I've already assigned
each of you a fantastic role.

05:25.324 --> 05:26.743
"Lookout number two"?

05:26.826 --> 05:29.412
The roles have been carefully
chosen based on ability.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.540
And this heist has been
planned, dare I say,
to perfection.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.751
-What about hidden
security cams?
-It's in the binder.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.461
-What about lasers?
-Also in the binder.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.629
What if one of the day guards
picks up an extra shift

05:38.713 --> 05:41.090
so he can finally propose
to his high school squeeze?

05:41.174 --> 05:45.470
He quit smoking ages ago,
but carries around
a cigarette for the smell.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.555
-Nervous about the proposal...
-[sighs deeply]

05:47.638 --> 05:50.058
...he goes out for a whiff
of the old confidence stick
and spots us.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.976
That's not in the binder
because it's not
going to happen.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.519
Guys, I've thought of
everything, okay?

05:53.603 --> 05:55.646
I mean, look how sick
this binder is.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.523
That is leadership.

05:57.607 --> 06:00.401
I know I wasn't invited
on this adventure,
but I do have n-zotes.

06:00.485 --> 06:03.154
Not listening to you.
Okay, so that's the plan.

06:03.237 --> 06:06.365
[applauding] Great plan.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.951
Sorry if this clap
sounds sarcastic.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.913
I sprained my hand
playing table tennis.

06:11.996 --> 06:13.623
What the hell
are you doing here, Bane?

06:13.706 --> 06:17.251
I am here for revenge!

06:17.335 --> 06:22.632
I gave Amy and Kite Man
a very expensive pasta maker
for their wedding,

06:22.715 --> 06:24.926
but they didn't get married!

06:25.009 --> 06:27.095
[coughs] It's gauche
to keep the gift.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.972
Yeah, and it's double gauche
to ask for it back,
you dickstick.

06:30.056 --> 06:33.142
And we don't even know
where it is.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.478
[burping]

06:35.561 --> 06:42.151
I asked nicely, but next time
I return, there will be
no good manners.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.614
All right, boss,
time to steal a mosquito.

06:46.697 --> 06:47.698
Okay, on three.

06:47.782 --> 06:50.076
[all] One, two, three!

06:50.159 --> 06:54.122
Shit! Sorry I didn't tell you
what to say on three.
I just counted.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.082
Should we go again?
No, let's just go.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.751
[upbeat music playing]

07:04.465 --> 07:06.175
All clear.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.177
You know why I picked up
this extra shift?

07:08.261 --> 07:09.595
Because I need
a little extra money.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.597
I'm proposing to
my high school sweetheart,

07:11.681 --> 07:14.517
and I don't know why
this is so nerve-wracking.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.893
We're basically married.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.353
I quit smoking a long time ago.

07:17.436 --> 07:19.188
I just carry it around
for the smell.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.524
What, King Shark and his gang?

07:21.607 --> 07:23.192
[alarm blaring]

07:23.276 --> 07:24.652
Ah, shit on a pony,
there shouldn't be
guards here--

07:24.735 --> 07:25.444
[Harley] Come on,
let's go, let's go.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.369
-Ive, what do we do?
-Run!

07:33.452 --> 07:35.371
[King Shark]
Did she just ditch us?

07:35.454 --> 07:37.874
Okay. Ivy is not
leading our next thing.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.459
Okay, look, I'm sure
this is just part of the plan.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.461
She's got it
under control. Okay?

07:42.545 --> 07:44.172
Was this in the binder?

07:48.426 --> 07:50.553
Oh, good!
You got the magic bug.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.388
-What now, Ive?
-Should we escape
through the basement?

07:52.471 --> 07:53.764
Or bust open the front door?

07:53.848 --> 07:56.893
[all] Ivy! Ivy! Ivy!
Ivy! Ivy! Ivy! Ivy!

07:56.976 --> 07:58.227
Ah!

08:04.442 --> 08:08.446
How is an Ivy plan
even more of a disaster
than a Harley plan?

08:08.529 --> 08:09.947
It's a surprise to me too.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.868
Okay. Successful heist, right?

08:13.951 --> 08:15.578
-[all groan]
-All right.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.164
Yeah. It looks like
it went great, boss.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.917
Look, there's dead plant matter
under this piece of concrete,

08:21.000 --> 08:25.421
and when I apply the
Eden Serum, it will reanimate
the plant and enhance it.

08:25.504 --> 08:26.923
Watch and learn.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.051
[squeaks]

08:30.134 --> 08:31.928
Ah, yes!

08:32.011 --> 08:33.971
Oh-ho, success!

08:34.847 --> 08:36.474
Oh, my gosh, this is...

08:39.852 --> 08:41.854
-Oh, no!
-[King Shark groans]

08:41.938 --> 08:43.272
Aah!

08:45.191 --> 08:46.108
Oh!

08:47.944 --> 08:48.819
[screams]

08:53.032 --> 08:54.867
Oh, that's terrifying!

08:56.410 --> 08:57.578
Oh, my God.

09:00.623 --> 09:03.292
Shit! Shit! Shit!

09:03.376 --> 09:04.710
-[sizzles]
-[screams]

09:04.794 --> 09:06.587
[grunts]

09:06.671 --> 09:12.051
I'm not going to repeat
what that plant said,
but he fucking hates you.

09:18.015 --> 09:21.018
Knock, knock. I'mma coming in,
so I'm gonna... [grunting]

09:23.145 --> 09:24.480
[screams]

09:24.563 --> 09:26.691
Hey, Ive, I can't find the
opening to your flower.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.693
[chuckles] Which is a first.

09:30.361 --> 09:31.612
-[gasping] Hey!
-I screwed it up.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.823
I screwed up
the Eden Serum formula.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.408
What makes you think that?

09:35.491 --> 09:37.326
There are too many cooks
in the kitchen.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.746
It will be way better
if I can just work
on this plan alone.

09:40.830 --> 09:44.917
Yeah, no problem. I will tell
King Shark and Clayface
it is just gonna be us.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.210
I will let them down easy.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.380
I mean alone, Harley.
Like, just me.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.591
[gasps, sobs]

09:58.889 --> 09:59.974
[Batgirl]
Okay, what's the plan?

10:00.057 --> 10:01.225
Batgirl, take out the goons.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.727
Robin, get the sprinklers
back online.

10:02.810 --> 10:03.769
Nightwing...

10:03.853 --> 10:05.146
Wait. Where's Nightwing?

10:06.814 --> 10:08.274
Evening, gentlemen.

10:08.357 --> 10:10.651
Didn't your mom ever tell you
not to play with matches?

10:10.735 --> 10:12.695
Well, maybe
he doesn't have a mom

10:12.778 --> 10:15.072
or wasn't raised in
a traditional household.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.366
You're making a lot
of assumptions here.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.535
It's the Bat Family. Get them.

10:19.618 --> 10:20.995
Change of plans, I guess.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.712
The plan was to be discreet.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.213
I don't do discreet. [grunts]

10:32.673 --> 10:33.549
Hey!

10:38.179 --> 10:39.096
[grunts]

10:42.183 --> 10:43.684
Firefly, twelve o'clock.

10:46.103 --> 10:47.146
[Nightwing] I'm on it.

10:52.109 --> 10:53.277
-[gasps]
-Whoa...

10:53.361 --> 10:55.071
[both grunting]

11:03.496 --> 11:05.081
We need to do something
about the team.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.500
Yeah, I have notes
for everyone.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.336
-[groans]
-We're still getting
pizza after this, right?

11:10.419 --> 11:11.379
Give me that.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.507
Ugh, ugh!

11:14.590 --> 11:17.259
I cannot believe that
she doesn't want me.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.594
I mean us, us!

11:18.677 --> 11:21.138
If I've learned anything
from my one day

11:21.222 --> 11:23.557
on the set of
the Thomas Wayne biopic,

11:23.641 --> 11:27.311
everyone can be
a star in their own role.
Give her time.

11:27.395 --> 11:30.439
I'm sure Ivy will inhabit
the character of leader.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.608
[Frank] Good luck with that.

11:32.692 --> 11:36.779
I've known Ivy for 20 years
and she didn't even let me be
a part of the plant plan,

11:36.862 --> 11:38.948
and I'm a goddamn plant.
That's my thing.

11:39.031 --> 11:43.577
[groaning] I wish there was
some way to teach her
how important teamwork is.

11:43.661 --> 11:46.330
[man on TV] Are you
looking for a fun
team-building activity?

11:46.414 --> 11:48.791
[yelps] That's exactly
what I need.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.793
Something to
foster camaraderie.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.711
Perhaps you need
to foster group camaraderie.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.297
It's at the top of
my foster list
above the kittens.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.801
♪ If you want to have fun
And do it as a team
Then come on down ♪

11:58.884 --> 12:00.469
♪ To Green Street ♪

12:00.553 --> 12:01.762
I have an idea.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.931
Is it the commercial
we all just heard?

12:04.014 --> 12:07.560
No, I am not a dumb sponge
soaking up, spitting out
whatever I hear on TV. Okay?

12:09.603 --> 12:10.771
[automated beeping]

12:13.649 --> 12:17.236
Uh, usually when
a bomb beeps, it's a bad thing.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.489
Because they're about
to explo...

12:21.574 --> 12:22.825
Eh.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.118
-[alarm buzzes]
-Your card's been declined.

12:24.201 --> 12:26.328
Impossible. I use autopay.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.831
I also went paperless
to save the trees.

12:28.914 --> 12:31.041
Declined. There's a hold
for identity theft.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.168
You'll have
to talk to your bank.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.711
This is outrageous!

12:33.794 --> 12:36.130
I need to blow up
a mall tonight.

12:36.213 --> 12:37.673
Could you hold it for me?

12:37.756 --> 12:41.135
If I do that for you,
I gotta do it for everybody.

12:41.218 --> 12:44.180
You're giving my explosives
to freaking Calendar Man?

12:44.263 --> 12:47.224
What's he going to blow up?
Valentine's Day?

12:47.308 --> 12:48.642
I hate this place.

12:48.726 --> 12:53.731
I will take the full fury
of my business elsewhere.

12:53.814 --> 12:56.692
The ransom video said
they're holding Harley in here.

12:56.775 --> 12:57.902
Well, are you sure?

12:57.985 --> 13:00.196
What the hell
is this place? Huh?

13:00.279 --> 13:04.241
A great way to take your mind
off things and let those
creative juices flow.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.993
So, being kidnapped...

13:06.076 --> 13:08.537
Was, on second thought,
an over-the-top lie
to get you here,

13:08.621 --> 13:11.248
-which, by the way,
took a lot of work.
-And where is here?

13:11.332 --> 13:13.501
An escape room! Oh, no!

13:13.584 --> 13:17.254
Did we stumble upon
the abandoned home of
Professor Phineas T. Puzzler?

13:17.338 --> 13:20.341
Eccentric inventor
and noted recluse.

13:20.424 --> 13:22.718
The only way out of this
mysterious mansion

13:22.801 --> 13:25.930
is to solve a series of clues,
each more fiendish
than the next.

13:26.013 --> 13:28.265
You know, there's no way
I'm going to do that.

13:28.349 --> 13:32.645
Oh, it's just one hour, and I
already forged your signature
on the release, so, ha.

13:32.728 --> 13:33.771
[scoffs]

13:38.192 --> 13:40.611
Oh, great. Noobs.

13:40.694 --> 13:43.280
It was half price if we didn't
ask for a private group.

13:43.364 --> 13:46.492
I'm Nelvin Eckles,
escape room extraordinaire.

13:46.575 --> 13:47.910
You don't follow me on social?

13:47.993 --> 13:49.119
Yeah, I'm done.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.371
I'm not spending an hour
with this guy.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.125
Wait. Is this thing real?

13:55.209 --> 13:56.752
-Ahoy.
-Riddler?

13:56.835 --> 13:58.921
It's me, Professor Puzzler,

13:59.004 --> 14:01.924
who's trapped in an escape room
with minutes to spare.

14:02.007 --> 14:05.678
A wrong answer would lead you
to your mortal despair.

14:05.761 --> 14:08.597
Fail to solve the puzzle,
you'll be squashed like a bug.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.349
Win and you'll get
a group photo

14:10.432 --> 14:14.103
and personalized mug,
limited to 11 characters.

14:14.186 --> 14:17.398
Huh! The ad did not
mention this.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.025
[glass shatters]

14:20.109 --> 14:22.111
Guys, it's gonna be okay.
We'll figure this out.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.738
-Okay, we won't but Ivy will.
-Ah, shit maggots.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.533
I should be working
on the Eden Serum
right now. Ugh!

14:27.616 --> 14:31.495
And you're gonna totally figure
that out, right after you
help us out of this jam

14:31.579 --> 14:33.455
because there is no one--

14:33.539 --> 14:36.250
Damn it, Harley! Please stop
telling me how smart and
what a great leader I am.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.961
I don't want
the responsibility. I don't.
Not a good leader!

14:39.044 --> 14:41.630
You've got to stop hitting
things when you're mad.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.048
It's ironic, I know, but...

14:44.091 --> 14:46.302
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.141
[both chuckle nervously] Huh?

14:53.559 --> 14:56.645
-Okay, ID?
-I'm Bane.

14:56.729 --> 15:00.774
You know... Bane! Bane.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.735
Okay, so we put a hold
on your account

15:02.818 --> 15:05.195
due to suspicious activity,
and we can go through
the charges.

15:05.279 --> 15:08.157
So there's, like, $20
at Big Belly Burger
at 8:00 a.m.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.160
Yeah, I like that
breakfast sandwich
as much as the next guy.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.330
Another $30
at Big Belly Burger
at 9:00 a.m.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.457
Well, perhaps it's more
than the next guy.

15:16.540 --> 15:17.708
Twenty-five cases
of hard seltzer.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.169
One hundred cals
and cheaper in bulk.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.880
There's nothing suspicious
about these activities.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.923
The wedding dress
worn by Sarah Jessica Parker

15:25.007 --> 15:27.551
in the Sex and the City movie,
that was such a cash grab,

15:27.635 --> 15:30.888
and you paid $50,000 for it.
I'm sorry, what?

15:30.971 --> 15:35.059
You can't put a price
on a bespoke Vivienne Westwood.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.769
It's a work of art!

15:36.852 --> 15:38.937
I know I'm just, like, a simple
bank teller or whatever,

15:39.021 --> 15:42.983
but looking at your purchase
history, I'm just like,
are you depressed?

15:43.067 --> 15:45.194
No... [hesitates]

15:46.445 --> 15:47.905
I couldn't help but wonder.

15:47.988 --> 15:50.282
Was the teller
telling the truth?

15:50.366 --> 15:51.700
Was I depressed?

15:51.784 --> 15:55.037
Perhaps my identity
had been stolen,

15:55.120 --> 15:56.789
by myself.

15:58.207 --> 16:01.543
-[clock beeping]
-Mmm.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.129
-So we're gonna die,
aren't we?
-Oh, yeah.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.924
And it might be
incredibly painful.

16:07.007 --> 16:09.176
If you'd like, I can just eat
you right now.

16:09.259 --> 16:10.386
Just save you the trouble.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.888
Piss cakes of a dick...

16:12.971 --> 16:16.141
Let the game begin,
my sad little pawns.

16:16.225 --> 16:19.269
Your opponent awaits,
a chess master of brawls.

16:19.353 --> 16:22.398
Time's wasted in danger,
will never abate.

16:22.481 --> 16:27.152
So make haste and escape,
with a nimble checkmate.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.904
Gonna need you
to step aside, ma'am.

16:28.987 --> 16:31.657
Card-carrying Mensa member.
JK, Mensa doesn't gift cards.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.242
My incredible brain is my card.

16:36.995 --> 16:39.832
I know this is terrifying,
but I am so impressed

16:39.915 --> 16:42.292
-with the production value.
-Right?

16:42.376 --> 16:44.420
So what are you doing here?

16:44.503 --> 16:46.088
What are you doing here?

16:46.171 --> 16:48.006
I heard the commercial
and thought,
"That's what we need..."

16:48.090 --> 16:49.800
-Group camaraderie!
-Yes!

16:49.883 --> 16:51.468
Yes, that's why
I brought us here.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.095
We are so fricking smart.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.264
I can't believe we got tricked
into coming here by Riddler.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.640
It was a catchy commercial.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.350
It was so catchy.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.396
Ha! Checkmate, bitches.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.814
Whoo! [chuckles]

17:03.897 --> 17:05.858
You're welcome.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.986
Hey, Searching for Bobby
Fuckstick, you just killed us.

17:11.029 --> 17:11.947
You're right.

17:12.030 --> 17:13.824
[moans] I'm so stupid.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.868
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

17:15.951 --> 17:19.371
And on IMDB,
I'm actually listed as
Clayface, Roman numeral four.

17:19.455 --> 17:22.791
But I hope I'll reclaim numeral
one when they update my credits

17:22.875 --> 17:26.128
to include my role in the new
Thomas Wayne movie.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.963
What Thomas Wayne movie?

17:28.047 --> 17:31.091
Great, great, great, great!
I'm going to die
with the eighth Robin.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.177
I'm the first!

17:33.260 --> 17:37.306
I thought I could cape
crusade on my own, but I let
Tarantula kill Blockbuster.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.808
It was big news
in Bludhaven. [groans]

17:39.892 --> 17:41.268
If the Bat Family
knew about it,

17:41.351 --> 17:43.312
they'd know
what a failure I was.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.272
If it was big news,
don't you think
they'd already know about it?

17:46.398 --> 17:48.442
I'm going to kill myself.

17:48.525 --> 17:51.153
You do not have to do that.
We're going to die in, like,
three and a half minutes.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.696
Not fast enough!

17:52.780 --> 17:54.656
Hey, I want to get out of here,
and I'm trying to form

17:54.740 --> 17:57.117
a complete fucking thought
before acting on it.
Unlike you...

17:57.201 --> 18:00.329
Yeah, well, the spikes ain't
gonna wait for you to come up
with something perfect.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.456
You might as well
come up here with me.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.792
I should have never left
Gotham in the first place.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.543
I got restless and
Batman pushed me.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.004
Oh, my God, shut up!

18:09.087 --> 18:12.966
He said, "Failure isn't fatal,
but failure to change
might be."

18:13.050 --> 18:15.344
Later, I found out he was just
quoting John Wooden,

18:15.427 --> 18:17.012
which is so basic!

18:17.096 --> 18:19.973
Oh, maybe that's it.
Maybe we have to fail
to succeed.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.475
Riddler's shit about checkmate.

18:21.558 --> 18:24.978
He didn't say it was us
doing the checking, mate.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.939
Ugh, yeah, I'm going
to kill myself too.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.529
Try jamming the gears. Stall.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.532
Okay, Mensa boy,
what's the quickest way
to lose a chess match?

18:36.615 --> 18:38.325
That's easy.
It's called a fool's mate.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.369
-It dates back to...
-Ugh, just tell me
what to move!

18:40.452 --> 18:42.704
Okay, okay.
Move your F pawn up one.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.082
[grunts]

18:46.542 --> 18:48.502
Okay, now move
your G pawn up two.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.048
[straining]

18:54.800 --> 18:57.010
-I did it.
-Oh, my God!

18:57.094 --> 19:01.014
-We are not going to die.
-Haven't they exploited that
poor, rich Wayne family enough?

19:01.098 --> 19:04.268
Every few years, there's
another film depicting
the Waynes' murder.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.061
We get it. Crime alley.

19:06.144 --> 19:09.231
The pearls, those pearls,
their beautiful child

19:09.314 --> 19:12.442
watches them fall,
as life is extinguished

19:12.526 --> 19:15.153
from his mother's eyes,
so too is his innocence.

19:15.237 --> 19:18.073
It's one thing for Bruce Wayne
to talk about his trauma,

19:18.156 --> 19:20.534
but for others to do it
over and over again...

19:20.617 --> 19:23.412
Yes, yes, go on.
I can use all of this.

19:24.079 --> 19:26.123
[rumbling]

19:30.168 --> 19:32.880
-Oh, look, we did it.
-Teamwork!

19:32.963 --> 19:34.756
-Ive!
-Harles.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.925
Did my stupid,
smart escape room idea work?

19:37.009 --> 19:41.597
I mean, we still might die,
but sure. I don't know
how you did it,

19:41.680 --> 19:44.308
setting me up to tackle
my exact issue back there.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.226
I mean, embracing
failure to win.

19:46.310 --> 19:47.603
How did you find this place?

19:47.686 --> 19:49.187
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

19:49.271 --> 19:51.189
but no one expects you
to be perfect.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.691
We will always have your back,

19:52.774 --> 19:55.444
-even if you screw up.
-This is very touching,

19:55.527 --> 19:57.905
and it will make an
excellent Hallmark movie...

19:57.988 --> 20:00.198
But we're going to die
in three minutes!

20:00.282 --> 20:04.912
No, we're not
because I'm going to do
everything I can to save us.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.997
And who cares
if it's not perfect?

20:07.080 --> 20:08.540
-I am...
-I just finished it.

20:08.624 --> 20:09.958
-Thank God.
-Oh, great.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.877
Yeah, congrats.
You got it. Fuck you!

20:11.960 --> 20:13.712
Please exit to the right
and leave the upper view

20:13.795 --> 20:16.506
to collect your photo
and mug. Eleven characters!

20:19.885 --> 20:23.430
You've got this, Ive.
We are all here for you.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.933
You gave this to that
knobby-kneed dandelion.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.393
-This is too strong.
-Okay, just hand me that.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.899
If I fail, I fail.

20:33.982 --> 20:36.234
And we'll try again
tomorrow, right?

20:48.163 --> 20:49.831
Yes!

20:49.915 --> 20:52.668
You did it! Oh, you're such
a smokeshow
when you're planning.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.545
Oh, something's wrong.
Something's very wrong.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.172
Whoa! [coughs]

20:57.255 --> 20:58.632
[Poison Ivy] Not in a hot
and sexy way.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.342
Run, run!

21:00.425 --> 21:02.844
Shit... It went down my throat!

21:02.928 --> 21:04.680
[tires screeching]

21:04.763 --> 21:10.978
At last! I shall have
my revenge for the pasta maker.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.897
Oh, oh, wow.

21:14.815 --> 21:18.193
I... I feel nothing.

21:18.276 --> 21:20.362
I couldn't help but wonder.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.990
Did I need a therapist
after all?

21:24.449 --> 21:26.368
[grunting]

21:26.451 --> 21:30.622
Is anyone hurt?
Suffering from current
traumatic stress disorder?

21:30.706 --> 21:32.207
Oh, no. Frank didn't
make it out.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.585
Frank, are you...

21:35.669 --> 21:37.087
Are you okay?

21:38.922 --> 21:39.840
I am...

21:41.258 --> 21:43.343
a God!

21:46.263 --> 21:47.472
Do you have any fours?

21:47.556 --> 21:49.057
Okay, let's try again.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.101
Hi, I'm Nightwing.

21:51.184 --> 21:54.021
I know. Last of the Flying
Graysons, ward of Bruce Wayne,
the original Robin.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.272
[chuckles] No, no.

21:55.355 --> 21:58.650
Nightwing, member of
the Bat Family.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.069
[Robin] You forgot
"giant dickhead, "dickhead!

22:01.153 --> 22:02.904
-[sighs]
-It's Firefly.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.448
He's attacking an orphanage.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.033
Quick, Bat Family,
to the Batmobile!

22:06.116 --> 22:07.743
-Shotgun.
-You can ride with me.

22:07.826 --> 22:08.744
Thanks.

22:08.827 --> 22:09.911
Maybe next time...

22:13.206 --> 22:14.207
[yelps]

22:21.048 --> 22:22.215
