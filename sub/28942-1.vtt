03:19.741 --> 03:23.370
for the third time in a row,

03:23.996 --> 03:25.789
Miss Simone Wellington.

03:35.799 --> 03:36.800
Thank you.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.974
Thank you so much.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.517
Thank you, Linda.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.227
You know,

03:48.103 --> 03:53.274
you can choose any life you want

03:48.103 --> 03:53.274
as long as you take control

03:53.316 --> 03:56.111
and you tell yourself

03:53.316 --> 03:56.111
"I can do it."

03:56.153 --> 03:58.279
Let me hear you all

03:56.153 --> 03:58.279
say that with me.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.823
I can do it.

04:03.827 --> 04:04.912
I can do it.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.039
And yes you can.

04:09.332 --> 04:14.171
I would like to announce that my

04:09.332 --> 04:14.171
third best-selling motivational

04:09.332 --> 04:14.171
program entitled "Don't Quit"

04:14.213 --> 04:15.338
has just sold...

04:16.339 --> 04:18.632
- twenty million

04:16.339 --> 04:18.632
copies digitally.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.261
Whoo! Yeah!

04:21.511 --> 04:25.182
I'd also like to announce

04:21.511 --> 04:25.182
that Wellington Tech

04:25.224 --> 04:30.311
has just completed our new

04:25.224 --> 04:30.311
Intel processor software chip

04:30.353 --> 04:35.067
that will be in every laptop

04:30.353 --> 04:35.067
computer across the world

04:30.353 --> 04:35.067
in just a short time

04:35.109 --> 04:38.486
and that is thanks to my lead

04:35.109 --> 04:38.486
programmer Tyra Johnson.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.784
Hey, that's my wife.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.784
I just wanted to--

04:44.118 --> 04:45.285
Yeah!

04:47.037 --> 04:49.164
She invented the program

04:47.037 --> 04:49.164
and we could not do any

04:47.037 --> 04:49.164
of this without you.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.540
Thank you so much, Tyra.

04:51.083 --> 04:56.379
And of course the woman

04:51.083 --> 04:56.379
who brought Tyra to us,

04:51.083 --> 04:56.379
Miss Paige Davis.

04:59.841 --> 05:05.513
But I cannot even begin

04:59.841 --> 05:05.513
to take all of the credit.

05:05.931 --> 05:10.518
Linda, you have been

05:05.931 --> 05:10.518
there since day one

05:11.394 --> 05:16.775
and I could not have

05:11.394 --> 05:16.775
accomplished any

05:11.394 --> 05:16.775
of this without you.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.652
Thank you.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.572
Is my team amazing or what?

05:22.614 --> 05:25.033
Yeah!

05:25.408 --> 05:29.370
You guys give me two

05:25.408 --> 05:29.370
hundred percent every day.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.622
So at this time

05:31.999 --> 05:37.336
I would like to announce

05:31.999 --> 05:37.336
my new President

05:31.999 --> 05:37.336
of Sales, Paige Davis.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.386
Whoa!

05:47.806 --> 05:52.602
You have been my number one

05:47.806 --> 05:52.602
salesperson for a year straight

05:52.644 --> 05:55.563
and your hard work

05:52.644 --> 05:55.563
does not go unnoticed.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.399
So thank you for that,

05:55.605 --> 05:58.399
Madam President.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.402
Baby, are you crying? You okay?

06:01.444 --> 06:03.404
No, it's just my

06:01.444 --> 06:03.404
allergies kicking in.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.867
Baby, you don't--

06:04.781 --> 06:06.867
you don't have allergies.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.576
Well I do tonight.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.871
So this night is

06:08.618 --> 06:10.871
a little bittersweet.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.917
Wellington is

06:12.455 --> 06:15.917
at the top of its game

06:15.959 --> 06:18.045
and I would like

06:15.959 --> 06:18.045
to keep it that way,

06:18.545 --> 06:21.548
which is why it saddens

06:18.545 --> 06:21.548
me to announce

06:22.549 --> 06:25.719
that I will be selling

06:22.549 --> 06:25.719
Wellington Tech and retiring.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.095
Wait, what?

06:27.470 --> 06:29.264
What?

06:29.306 --> 06:33.392
I want to thank all of you

06:29.306 --> 06:33.392
for being so supportive

06:29.306 --> 06:33.392
throughout my career

06:33.935 --> 06:38.357
but it's time we reach

06:33.935 --> 06:38.357
the new level and you

06:33.935 --> 06:38.357
all carry on my legacy.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.733
My staff,

06:41.484 --> 06:43.402
my employees, my colleagues,

06:44.654 --> 06:46.698
you will continue the work

06:47.490 --> 06:51.410
and Wellington will be the

06:47.490 --> 06:51.410
greatest company that it can be.

06:52.787 --> 06:55.414
Thank you. And enjoy

06:52.787 --> 06:55.414
the evening.

06:57.167 --> 07:00.837
It's a party, come on!

06:57.167 --> 07:00.837
Dinner is served! Thank you!

07:00.879 --> 07:01.963
Good night!

07:22.525 --> 07:24.444
- Paige, right?

07:22.525 --> 07:24.444
- Hi.

07:24.485 --> 07:25.528
Congratulations.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.864
Thank you. I'm sorry,

07:25.570 --> 07:27.864
have we met?

07:27.906 --> 07:29.408
I've seen you around.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.868
President of Sales, right?

07:29.449 --> 07:31.868
That's big shoes to fill.

07:32.202 --> 07:35.580
Yes. And I will do everything in

07:32.202 --> 07:35.580
my power to make my team proud.

07:36.039 --> 07:40.501
I just think it's so wonderful

07:36.039 --> 07:40.501
how our company is quick

07:36.039 --> 07:40.501
to give the little guy a chance.

07:40.543 --> 07:44.005
Keep up the good work.

07:40.543 --> 07:44.005
We love ones like you,

07:40.543 --> 07:44.005
so eager to move up.

07:44.547 --> 07:48.260
Yes. Well maybe in a few

07:44.547 --> 07:48.260
years I'll be a partner. Yes.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.804
Wow, what a dreamer.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.804
I admire that.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.056
I was like you once

07:50.845 --> 07:53.056
and now look at me,

07:53.098 --> 07:56.351
partner of Wellington Tech

07:53.098 --> 07:56.351
in just two months.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.980
Wow! Really? In just two months?

08:00.021 --> 08:01.648
That's-- that's crazy, huh.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.900
I mean, well if that's the case,

08:01.689 --> 08:03.900
I should be partner.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.526
I didn't know that they were

08:03.942 --> 08:05.526
passing out the position.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.528
President of Sales

08:05.568 --> 08:07.528
is not partner material.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.531
And technically, I was

08:07.570 --> 08:10.531
brought in at a much higher

08:07.570 --> 08:10.531
position than you already,

08:10.573 --> 08:12.492
so it's not as crazy

08:10.573 --> 08:12.492
as it sounds.

08:13.160 --> 08:17.497
So I guess you work for me now.

08:13.160 --> 08:17.497
This should be fun.

08:17.538 --> 08:18.498
Really.

08:20.083 --> 08:23.128
Hey, hey, I'm Tyra. I work on

08:20.083 --> 08:23.128
the second floor programming.

08:23.170 --> 08:27.132
Alexa Sims, I see you

08:23.170 --> 08:27.132
every day on the elevator.

08:23.170 --> 08:27.132
I'm a huge fan.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.175
- Really?

08:27.174 --> 08:28.175
- Yes.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.511
- I'm flattered, Nina.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.511
- No, I'm Tyra.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.513
I work on the second

08:31.552 --> 08:33.513
floor programming.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.058
I'll see you around, Paige.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.559
Oh, Simone.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.480
That woman is my hero.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.563
Girl, shut up. She didn't

08:41.520 --> 08:43.563
even know your name.

08:43.606 --> 08:47.568
How could she be your hero?

08:43.606 --> 08:47.568
She's only been here two months.

08:43.606 --> 08:47.568
I should be your hero.

08:47.610 --> 08:51.531
No, you're not my hero.

08:47.610 --> 08:51.531
Girl, you're my best friend.

08:47.610 --> 08:51.531
That's my hero.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.575
I just don't understand

08:52.157 --> 08:54.575
how they brought her

08:52.157 --> 08:54.575
in here out of nowhere

08:54.617 --> 08:56.619
and she's already partner.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.580
That woman's the best.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.580
They brought her in from the

08:56.661 --> 08:59.580
biggest competitor corporation.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.208
You should be happy

08:59.622 --> 09:01.208
she's on our team.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.543
Whatever. She's

09:01.624 --> 09:03.543
not even all that.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.380
Let's go talk to Simone too.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.340
Oh no, no. We-- we're going

09:06.421 --> 09:08.340
to the restroom, remember?

09:08.382 --> 09:09.549
Oh yeah, right, restroom.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.178
Okay, but let's just go fast

09:11.468 --> 09:13.178
so that we can come back

09:11.468 --> 09:13.178
and talk to Simone too.

09:13.220 --> 09:13.970
Okay.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.305
♪♪

09:16.639 --> 09:18.808
It was a good event

09:16.639 --> 09:18.808
tonight. I'm so excited.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.061
- Wellington Tech.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.061
- Ladies.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.604
- Hi.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.604
- Spectacular evening, isn't it?

09:23.646 --> 09:25.690
Yes. I kind of don't want

09:23.646 --> 09:25.690
this night to end.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.903
You two are my stars.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.822
I am so proud of both of you.

09:32.864 --> 09:36.535
Paige, so glad that

09:32.864 --> 09:36.535
you're finally getting

09:32.864 --> 09:36.535
what you deserve.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.412
When this company sells,

09:38.453 --> 09:41.289
you two ladies are going

09:38.453 --> 09:41.289
to be taken care of,

09:38.453 --> 09:41.289
let me tell you that.

09:41.331 --> 09:47.337
Oh, thank you. But you decided

09:41.331 --> 09:47.337
to sell the company. Why now?

09:41.331 --> 09:47.337
It's our highest profit year.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.381
Why not?

09:49.923 --> 09:52.300
I've been doing this

09:49.923 --> 09:52.300
my entire life.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.095
I'm tired of working so hard.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.264
I want to spend time

09:55.554 --> 09:57.264
with my husband.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.641
Besides, I have a lot of money.

10:00.683 --> 10:01.601
- Yes.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.645
I'm thinking of buying

10:03.144 --> 10:04.645
an island in the Bahamas

10:03.144 --> 10:04.645
next year.

10:04.687 --> 10:08.608
Ooh. I want to be just like

10:04.687 --> 10:08.608
you when I grow up.

10:08.649 --> 10:12.279
Me too. And retire with class.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.741
Hey, I have an idea.

10:16.783 --> 10:21.371
I am giving a farewell speech

10:16.783 --> 10:21.371
in San Francisco this weekend.

10:21.413 --> 10:24.665
Why don't the two of you

10:21.413 --> 10:24.665
join me? All expenses paid.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.668
Think of it like a company trip.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.463
Leave the husbands at home.

10:29.921 --> 10:32.006
It'll be just us girls.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.343
What do you think? We'll

10:32.048 --> 10:35.343
have the time of our lives.

10:36.719 --> 10:37.804
Um,

10:38.430 --> 10:41.308
well, we would be honored,

10:38.430 --> 10:41.308
Mrs. Wellington.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.519
- We can't say no.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.519
- No, you really can't.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.273
- I'll have Jackie

10:45.979 --> 10:48.273
send you the details.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.273
- Thank you.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.276
- Yes, thank you.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.276
Cheers to that.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.276
- My pleasure.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.366
- She is a rich--

10:55.780 --> 10:58.366
- She's going to pay

10:55.780 --> 10:58.366
for everything.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.493
--Ass bitch.

10:59.534 --> 11:00.701
You're rich...

11:05.748 --> 11:09.043
Babe, babe, you're forgetting

11:05.748 --> 11:09.043
your lunch.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.671
I was in there working

11:09.085 --> 11:11.671
hard over the stove.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.508
- I love you.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.508
- I love you too.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.635
Look at this, wearing

11:14.549 --> 11:16.635
all my red lipstick.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.386
Now what time is this

11:16.675 --> 11:18.386
flight taking off?

11:18.428 --> 11:19.762
Flight's at 3:00 p.m.

11:19.804 --> 11:24.267
You know I can't take

11:19.804 --> 11:24.267
your sister with us.

11:19.804 --> 11:24.267
This is a work trip.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.102
But it's just for the weekend.

11:26.144 --> 11:30.731
And this is a great opportunity

11:26.144 --> 11:30.731
for her to finally get her mind

11:26.144 --> 11:30.731
off losing her job.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.527
And she really,

11:30.773 --> 11:33.527
really looks up to you.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.694
I know, I know, but you

11:33.568 --> 11:35.694
know what happened

11:35.736 --> 11:37.905
the last time I tried to take

11:35.736 --> 11:37.905
her with us somewhere.

11:37.947 --> 11:41.075
She embarrassed me in

11:37.947 --> 11:41.075
front of the entire family.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.495
It was a long time ago.

11:43.537 --> 11:44.745
Well, I'm going

11:43.537 --> 11:44.745
to miss you, babe.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.414
I'm going to miss you too.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.126
Then don't leave. Stay with me.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.045
- Oh...

11:50.168 --> 11:52.045
- I'm just playing.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.045
Or I can just go with you.

11:52.086 --> 11:55.756
No. You know my boss invited me

11:52.086 --> 11:55.756
personally with all the girls.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.758
Babe, you can't go this time.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.220
You went to three

11:57.800 --> 12:00.220
company trips already.

12:00.261 --> 12:05.684
This is a great opportunity

12:00.261 --> 12:05.684
for you girls to bond

12:00.261 --> 12:05.684
and go on a girls trip, right?

12:05.724 --> 12:08.436
Yeah, but your sister really

12:05.724 --> 12:08.436
isn't one of the girls.

12:08.936 --> 12:12.940
Damn. I've done

12:08.936 --> 12:12.940
favor after favor for you.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.775
You can at least

12:12.982 --> 12:14.775
do this one for me.

12:14.817 --> 12:18.154
Just go have a good time

12:14.817 --> 12:18.154
and make sure you call

12:14.817 --> 12:18.154
me when you land

12:18.196 --> 12:19.780
so I know you made it safe.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.824
Baby, I will, okay? I love you.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.495
- You know I can't

12:22.576 --> 12:25.495
say no to that face.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.495
- Oh.

12:28.289 --> 12:32.043
- Okay, okay. I'll take her.

12:32.335 --> 12:33.794
Best hubby in the world.

12:33.836 --> 12:36.839
I got to be. There's a lot

12:33.836 --> 12:36.839
of men out there trying

12:33.836 --> 12:36.839
to get my woman.

12:37.840 --> 12:42.053
God, I don't want you to go.

12:37.840 --> 12:42.053
I don't

12:37.840 --> 12:42.053
want you to go.

12:53.398 --> 12:57.611
I have to call my assistant's

12:53.398 --> 12:57.611
boss first to see if it's

12:53.398 --> 12:57.611
okay for me to take her.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.778
I can't just show up

12:57.652 --> 12:59.778
with a tag-along.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.406
- Thank you.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.406
- Hm.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.825
I knew you'd say yes

13:01.864 --> 13:04.825
so I gave her the information.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.825
She'll see you at the airport.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.705
Can I get a kiss?

13:15.044 --> 13:19.299
I emailed your schedule for the

13:15.044 --> 13:19.299
weekend so you're all set. Yeah.

13:19.882 --> 13:24.763
And if there's nothing else, I'm

13:19.882 --> 13:24.763
going to head home and spend

13:19.882 --> 13:24.763
the weekend with my husband.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.473
I am going to close

13:24.803 --> 13:26.473
the deal and I'm going

13:24.803 --> 13:26.473
to try to have fun.

13:26.514 --> 13:27.515
Perfect.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.183
- See you Monday.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.183
- Alright. See you Monday.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.438
- Hey, hey.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.438
- Hey, how are you?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.189
- Hey, hey.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.189
- Hey lady.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.857
You ready to go, old-timer?

13:36.899 --> 13:39.026
- Oh, who are you

13:36.899 --> 13:39.026
calling "old-timer"?

13:39.068 --> 13:40.153
Oh, it's me.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.240
I'm just ready

13:41.820 --> 13:44.240
as I'll ever be.

13:44.282 --> 13:49.036
I really haven't had a chance to

13:44.282 --> 13:49.036
tell you how exciting this is.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.830
I mean selling

13:49.078 --> 13:51.830
the company, that is big!

13:52.123 --> 13:53.750
Look how far we've come.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.209
Yeah, we did this.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.835
Yes, we did.

13:56.877 --> 14:00.298
I got to tell you though,

13:56.877 --> 14:00.298
I kind of miss the old days.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.090
Ooh.

14:01.132 --> 14:02.883
You and me in the basement.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.218
- Not so much.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.218
- No?

14:05.928 --> 14:09.349
Linda, you got a lot

14:05.928 --> 14:09.349
of good years left in you.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.849
I'm getting older.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.895
I want to spend some quality

14:12.935 --> 14:14.895
time with that hot husband

14:12.935 --> 14:14.895
of mine while I still can.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.314
As you should.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.856
- Prime of my life.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.856
- Yes.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.067
Alright.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.862
- Let's go close the deal.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.862
- Yes.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.906
And then promise me we're going

14:23.070 --> 14:25.906
to try to have a little fun.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.325
- A last hurrah?

14:25.948 --> 14:27.325
- Yes.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.327
- I am all in.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.327
- Okay.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.954
- See you soon.

- Alright. See you on the jet.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.418

27:18.636 --> 27:21.307
Oh, we must have

27:18.636 --> 27:21.307
been late last night.

27:23.641 --> 27:24.810
Simone, wake up.

27:25.269 --> 27:27.854
Girl, stop playing.

27:25.269 --> 27:27.854
Eh, wake up.

27:28.397 --> 27:29.898
Boss lady, eh.

27:31.942 --> 27:34.652
This is not funny. Simone?

27:36.447 --> 27:38.656
Simone. Boss lady.

27:39.617 --> 27:40.784
This is not funny.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.286
Simone?

27:43.496 --> 27:44.704
I don't like this.

27:44.746 --> 27:49.709
Boss lady. Simone.

27:44.746 --> 27:49.709
Oh, my God. This is not funny.

27:49.751 --> 27:50.668
Simone?

27:52.045 --> 27:52.963
Simone

27:54.923 --> 27:58.218
Simone? Eh, come on.

27:59.052 --> 28:01.555
Girl, why are you

27:59.052 --> 28:01.555
acting so confused?

28:01.930 --> 28:03.890
- What's wrong?

28:01.930 --> 28:03.890
- Ty.

28:04.475 --> 28:05.434
Yeah?

28:05.476 --> 28:06.726
I think she's dead.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.187
Oh, my God.

28:08.479 --> 28:11.190
- You think she's what?

28:08.479 --> 28:11.190
- I think we killed our boss.

28:12.065 --> 28:13.108
Well, check her pulse.

28:13.150 --> 28:15.068
I ain't touching no dead body.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.529
Well, neither am I.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.989
Oh, no.

28:20.907 --> 28:23.952
Oh, my God.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.539
The hell?

28:26.788 --> 28:29.166
Can somebody please

28:26.788 --> 28:29.166
shut that baby up?

28:32.836 --> 28:35.464
- It's not a baby, it's Paige.

28:35.506 --> 28:37.007
That figures.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.467
Oh, my God. What

28:37.049 --> 28:38.467
are we going to do?

28:38.967 --> 28:41.887
What? Why don't you tell

28:38.967 --> 28:41.887
me what's going on?

28:42.429 --> 28:44.431
Would you be quiet?

28:42.429 --> 28:44.431
I need to think.

28:44.806 --> 28:47.726
Why is Simone on the floor?

28:44.806 --> 28:47.726
Why is she not in her bed?

28:48.768 --> 28:51.146
I think she's... dead.

28:51.438 --> 28:54.774
Mm. Simone is not dead.

28:51.438 --> 28:54.774
She's probably just asleep.

28:54.816 --> 28:58.654
We had a lot to drink last

28:54.816 --> 28:58.654
night. Come on, Simone. Simone.

29:02.324 --> 29:03.158
What?

29:03.576 --> 29:05.744
I think you're right.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.162
Simone is dead.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.789
- I'm calling 911.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.789
- No, no, no, don't, don't

29:09.831 --> 29:12.792
Don't do that yet, okay?

29:09.831 --> 29:12.792
We-- just-- think about it.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.629
It's three African-American

29:12.834 --> 29:15.629
women in a hotel room

29:15.671 --> 29:18.798
with one of the most richest,

29:15.671 --> 29:18.798
most powerful white women dead.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.093
Hey, just think

29:18.840 --> 29:21.093
about how that'll look.

29:21.134 --> 29:24.804
I think Lexy's right. What if

29:21.134 --> 29:24.804
somebody killed her and now they

29:21.134 --> 29:24.804
are trying to frame us for it?

29:24.846 --> 29:27.807
That's life in prison.

29:24.846 --> 29:27.807
I can't go to jail, Ty--

29:27.849 --> 29:32.605
Nobody is going to jail.

29:27.849 --> 29:32.605
No one is going to jail. We

29:27.849 --> 29:32.605
don't even know what happened.

29:32.646 --> 29:34.856
She could have had a stroke

29:32.646 --> 29:34.856
or a heart attack or something.

29:34.898 --> 29:37.984
- Yeah. Yeah, we was popping

29:34.898 --> 29:37.984
a lot of pills last night.

29:34.898 --> 29:37.984
- Right. Yeah.

29:38.026 --> 29:40.613
- And drinking.

29:38.026 --> 29:40.613
And she's old.

29:38.026 --> 29:40.613
- Mm-Hm.

29:40.654 --> 29:44.742
Wait. What about if somebody

29:40.654 --> 29:44.742
ran up in here while we were

29:40.654 --> 29:44.742
sleeping and killed her or--

29:44.783 --> 29:48.287
or-- or maybe we roughed

29:44.783 --> 29:48.287
her up too much and knocked

29:44.783 --> 29:48.287
her out by accident?

29:48.328 --> 29:50.830
All I'm saying

29:48.328 --> 29:50.830
is Simone is dead.

29:50.872 --> 29:55.877
Whether she got killed

29:50.872 --> 29:55.877
or she OD'ed or the bitch

29:50.872 --> 29:55.877
just died of natural causes,

29:55.919 --> 29:59.715
how is that going to look

29:55.919 --> 29:59.715
if somebody finds out?

29:55.919 --> 29:59.715
My God.

29:59.757 --> 30:02.676
Why? I didn't do

29:59.757 --> 30:02.676
anything to this woman.

29:59.757 --> 30:02.676
I didn't kill her.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.722
Oh my God, it's the police.

30:06.764 --> 30:09.015
The police is

30:06.764 --> 30:09.015
here, they're here. They are

30:06.764 --> 30:09.015
going to take me. I know it.

30:09.057 --> 30:12.102
No, no, no, no.

30:09.057 --> 30:12.102
You guys just grab the

30:09.057 --> 30:12.102
body. Move the body.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.229
I ain't touching no dead body.

30:14.271 --> 30:17.232
- Come on, grab the body.

30:18.191 --> 30:20.569
One, two,

30:18.191 --> 30:20.569
three. Come.

30:18.191 --> 30:20.569
Up.

30:22.780 --> 30:25.365
One, two, three, go.

30:26.116 --> 30:28.327
- Okay. Okay. Come.

30:26.116 --> 30:28.327
- Okay, okay.

30:31.913 --> 30:35.626
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.544
Who is this?

30:43.425 --> 30:44.510
Who is it?

30:44.926 --> 30:46.845
- Open up, it's Keke.

30:44.926 --> 30:46.845
- Oh.

30:47.929 --> 30:51.642
It's Keke. She'll say something.

30:47.929 --> 30:51.642
Just act natural, okay?

30:51.684 --> 30:52.643
Natural.

30:53.935 --> 30:56.229
Hi. Hi, Keke. Welcome.

30:57.147 --> 30:58.816
How are you doing?

30:58.898 --> 31:02.110
How is my favorite

30:58.898 --> 31:02.110
sister-in-law this morning, huh?

31:02.152 --> 31:03.903
- Big sis, you okay?

31:02.152 --> 31:03.903
- Yeah.

31:03.945 --> 31:07.533
I went to your room.

31:03.945 --> 31:07.533
I figured you was in here.

31:03.945 --> 31:07.533
We was lit last night.

31:07.574 --> 31:08.367
- Yeah.

31:07.574 --> 31:08.367
- But

31:08.950 --> 31:10.452
what did you all do

31:08.950 --> 31:10.452
after I left?

31:11.286 --> 31:12.788
Looks like a lot.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.873
Actually-- actually you kind of

31:12.830 --> 31:14.873
got lost after the party buzz.

31:15.541 --> 31:20.086
Remember Ted?

31:15.541 --> 31:20.086
Linda's assistant?

31:15.541 --> 31:20.086
I stayed with him last night.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.673
Wait, Ted? When

31:20.504 --> 31:22.673
did you meet Ted?

31:22.715 --> 31:24.591
Well, when I bumped

31:22.715 --> 31:24.591
into Linda in the lobby,

31:24.633 --> 31:26.593
after I bumped into Ted

31:24.633 --> 31:26.593
in the bathroom.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.928
Wait, how long were you

31:26.635 --> 31:28.928
in the lobby before you

31:26.635 --> 31:28.928
went to the room?

31:28.970 --> 31:32.558
Twenty minutes,

31:28.970 --> 31:32.558
but it was instant, it was

31:28.970 --> 31:32.558
like love at first sight,

31:32.599 --> 31:34.017
Romeo and Juliet,

31:34.142 --> 31:37.103
only the black version because

31:34.142 --> 31:37.103
I'm black mixed with white

31:37.145 --> 31:39.523
because he's white, so now

31:37.145 --> 31:39.523
it's like we are mixing and--

31:39.565 --> 31:41.650
- Okay, we get it, Keke.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.650
- Keke, where's Ted now?

31:42.484 --> 31:46.279
- Why the twenty-one

31:42.484 --> 31:46.279
questions? What the hell?

31:42.484 --> 31:46.279
Oh, Keke.

31:46.321 --> 31:49.449
- Whose foot is that?

31:46.321 --> 31:49.449
- Keke, Keke, listen,

31:46.321 --> 31:49.449
brace yourself, okay?

31:49.491 --> 31:51.951
We're about to tell you

31:49.491 --> 31:51.951
something really,

31:49.491 --> 31:51.951
really, really bad.

31:51.993 --> 31:55.038
Remember when I told you

31:51.993 --> 31:55.038
whatever happens between

31:51.993 --> 31:55.038
us stays between us?

31:55.080 --> 31:56.498
Of course, big sis.

31:56.540 --> 31:57.916
Okay. Well,

32:00.001 --> 32:02.796
okay, Simone Wellington is--

32:04.172 --> 32:05.006
Is dead!

32:05.799 --> 32:06.925
Oh, my gosh!

32:07.175 --> 32:08.552
- Oh, my God!

32:07.175 --> 32:08.552
- Keke.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.721
- Oh, my God.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.721
- You're going to draw attention.

32:10.763 --> 32:12.598
Oh, my God! I got to call 911.

32:12.639 --> 32:14.974
- No, no, no,

32:12.639 --> 32:14.974
not yet, not yet. Okay?

32:12.639 --> 32:14.974
Relax.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.935
- Not yet.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.935
- No, no, no, listen.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.479
Lexy thought it would

32:17.352 --> 32:19.479
look suspicious, you know?

32:19.521 --> 32:23.316
White woman dead,

32:19.521 --> 32:23.316
black women alive, jail.

32:23.358 --> 32:24.484
I ain't going to jail.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.113
What are we going to do?

32:25.611 --> 32:28.113
Who else knows about this?

32:28.154 --> 32:30.949
Of course nobody knows.

32:28.154 --> 32:30.949
We just found her this morning.

32:33.034 --> 32:33.911
Wait.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.663
Keke, you're a genius.

32:37.038 --> 32:37.997
She is?

32:38.331 --> 32:39.958
Wait, why am I a genius?

32:40.626 --> 32:42.753
No one knows she's dead.

32:42.795 --> 32:44.880
What the hell are you

32:42.795 --> 32:44.880
getting at, Paige?

32:44.922 --> 32:46.840
No one has to know she's dead.

32:48.049 --> 32:50.510
Like chopping up her body

32:48.049 --> 32:50.510
and feeding it to the pigs?

32:50.552 --> 32:55.390
No, Keke, that's not what

32:50.552 --> 32:55.390
I'm saying. You need to stop

32:50.552 --> 32:55.390
playing so many video games.

32:55.432 --> 32:57.476
- What are you saying?

32:55.432 --> 32:57.476
- What I'm saying is

32:57.517 --> 33:00.186
if we contact the police,

32:57.517 --> 33:00.186
we don't know what's

32:57.517 --> 33:00.186
going to happen.

33:00.228 --> 33:03.022
But if we pretend

33:00.228 --> 33:03.022
she's still alive,

33:03.064 --> 33:06.025
then we can find out what

33:03.064 --> 33:06.025
happened and then go to the

33:03.064 --> 33:06.025
police with the answers.

33:06.067 --> 33:08.194
- You know what?

33:06.067 --> 33:08.194
That's a good idea.

33:06.067 --> 33:08.194
Yes.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.405
Wait a minute. I don't know if

33:08.236 --> 33:10.405
that's going to work, you guys.

33:10.447 --> 33:13.659
We might go to jail for

33:10.447 --> 33:13.659
tampering with evidence

33:10.447 --> 33:13.659
and then covering up a murder.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.869
Y'all crazy. You know,

33:13.700 --> 33:15.869
I'm calling 911.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.120
No, no, no.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.120
Wait, wait.

33:17.913 --> 33:19.205
Lexy.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.667
If it was a murder,

33:19.247 --> 33:21.667
we don't even know that yet.

33:21.708 --> 33:24.043
And I think Paige

33:21.708 --> 33:24.043
is onto something.

33:21.708 --> 33:24.043
This might just work.

33:24.085 --> 33:27.046
Of course it's going to work

33:24.085 --> 33:27.046
'cause I thought of it.

33:27.088 --> 33:28.882
Well the only way

33:27.088 --> 33:28.882
the idea will really work

33:28.924 --> 33:31.176
is if we figure out what her

33:28.924 --> 33:31.176
schedule is for the day.

33:31.217 --> 33:32.636
What do we need for that?

33:33.345 --> 33:36.348
Lexy, you know what?

33:33.345 --> 33:36.348
That might work.

33:33.345 --> 33:36.348
You're actually brilliant.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.057
Wait a second.

33:38.099 --> 33:40.101
I came up with the plan

33:38.099 --> 33:40.101
and she said something

33:38.099 --> 33:40.101
about some schedule

33:40.143 --> 33:42.938
and all of a sudden she's

33:40.143 --> 33:42.938
brilliant? How does that happen?

33:42.980 --> 33:47.066
Because if we have her schedule

33:42.980 --> 33:47.066
then we can stick to the plan

33:42.980 --> 33:47.066
and we can keep her schedule.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.068
Right. No one will

33:47.108 --> 33:49.068
get suspicious.

33:49.110 --> 33:51.070
- I'm down. Let's do it.

33:49.110 --> 33:51.070
Totally agree.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.072
- Okay.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.072
- Alright. You guys,

33:51.112 --> 33:53.072
let's find her phone.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.200
I'm sure her assistant

33:53.114 --> 33:55.200
sent her schedule to her phone.

33:55.241 --> 33:56.368
Great idea.

33:56.409 --> 33:57.285
- Alright.

33:56.409 --> 33:57.285
- Come on.

34:02.123 --> 34:04.292
- Got it. Got it. Alright.

Got it?

34:04.668 --> 34:05.836
Open it.

34:05.878 --> 34:07.128
- Open it.

34:05.878 --> 34:07.128
- It's locked.

34:07.170 --> 34:08.797
Okay, give it to me.

Wait, how are we supposed

34:22.895 --> 34:25.522
to convince her partner?

34:26.023 --> 34:28.440
- Oh no. We got to cancel.

34:26.023 --> 34:28.440
- No, no, no, no.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.109
If we cancel, that's going

34:28.483 --> 34:30.109
to make us look suspicious.

34:30.150 --> 34:31.527
We got to find out

34:30.150 --> 34:31.527
what happened to our boss.

So how do we do it?

Wait, y'all just playing, right?

34:37.324 --> 34:39.369
One of y'all got to give

34:37.324 --> 34:39.369
up your lace front.

34:39.411 --> 34:40.370
Well, give her yours.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.121
- Uh-uh.

This is cut and shaped

34:42.163 --> 34:46.125
to my head. I mean what

37:49.350 --> 37:51.228

What? No, I didn't. She

37:51.269 --> 37:54.606
rescheduled late last night.

37:54.647 --> 37:57.316
Well, I just got a call from one

37:54.647 --> 37:57.316
of Miss Wellington's associates

37:57.358 --> 38:00.319
who said that she was waiting

37:57.358 --> 38:00.319
on you at the restaurant.

38:00.361 --> 38:02.614
- Are you sure?

38:00.361 --> 38:02.614
- Yes, I am.

Look, I know how you

38:02.655 --> 38:05.909
always told me Mrs. Wellington

38:02.655 --> 38:05.909
never likes to be stood up.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.577
Would you like me

38:05.951 --> 38:07.577
to reschedule?

38:07.619 --> 38:11.456
Uh, no, that's okay.

My apologies.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.992

How are we going to do that?

39:06.427 --> 39:09.014
I can't golf, you can't golf.

39:09.430 --> 39:10.890
We-- we have to go.

39:10.932 --> 39:12.851

39:10.932 --> 39:12.851
to do that, Tyra?

39:12.892 --> 39:16.395
Simone can't golf.

39:12.892 --> 39:16.395
Uh, news flash, Simone is dead.

39:16.437 --> 39:20.399
And how are we supposed

39:16.437 --> 39:20.399
to convince the investors that

39:16.437 --> 39:20.399
she's alive but not talking?

39:20.441 --> 39:25.197
I don't know Paige, you

39:20.441 --> 39:25.197
were the one with this bright

39:20.441 --> 39:25.197
idea. You tell me, huh?

39:25.238 --> 39:28.449
- You figure it out.

39:25.238 --> 39:28.449
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

39:25.238 --> 39:28.449
Don't come for me, Tyra.

39:28.491 --> 39:31.410
Don't act like any

39:28.491 --> 39:31.410
of this was my fault. You

39:28.491 --> 39:31.410
better not talk to me like that.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.371
Listen, would you

39:31.452 --> 39:33.371
two cut it out?

39:33.412 --> 39:35.414
- Listen, we are in public,

39:33.412 --> 39:35.414
so act like such.

39:33.412 --> 39:35.414
- Okay.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.169
Okay, okay.

39:40.045 --> 39:43.464
Oh yes, now

39:40.045 --> 39:43.464
that was a massage.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.175
Look like you needed it.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.386
Have a seat, gentlemen.

Excuse us. Thank you so much.

specifically clear.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.405
Kill Wellington.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.033
Very simple.

40:11.492 --> 40:14.579
I don't understand.

40:11.492 --> 40:14.579
We did everything that

40:11.492 --> 40:14.579
you asked us to do.

40:15.496 --> 40:18.917
We planted the drugs

40:15.496 --> 40:18.917
in the room, gave Simone

40:15.496 --> 40:18.917
the lethal dose.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.419
We even checked

40:18.958 --> 40:21.419
her pulse. Nothing.

40:22.754 --> 40:26.091
Then why is she still alive?

40:37.643 --> 40:38.937
Mmm-hmm.

40:39.645 --> 40:41.356
Let me tell you something.

40:44.067 --> 40:47.028
If this company sells,

40:44.067 --> 40:47.028
I don't get anything.

40:47.528 --> 40:52.033
And as long as Simone is alive,

40:47.528 --> 40:52.033
the company will sell.

40:56.537 --> 40:59.332
Hmm. I just had a massage.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.500
I'm going to calm down.

41:04.087 --> 41:06.881
If you can't get this done,

41:09.550 --> 41:11.344
I'll have to do it myself.

41:12.053 --> 41:16.433
What are we supposed to do?

41:12.053 --> 41:16.433
Do you want it to get messy?

41:12.053 --> 41:16.433
'Cause we can get messy.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.392
No mess.

41:18.559 --> 41:20.645
And nothing that can

41:18.559 --> 41:20.645
lead back to me either.

41:21.562 --> 41:22.814
What about those women?

Hey! Thank you. Thank you.

42:33.009 --> 42:35.011
Hey, make sure

42:33.009 --> 42:35.011
she looks alive.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.930
Make her say yes

42:35.053 --> 42:37.930
and no or something

42:35.053 --> 42:37.930
like you're talking to her.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.975
How she gonna

42:38.931 --> 42:40.975
say yes or no?

42:38.931 --> 42:40.975
- I don't know.

42:41.017 --> 42:43.561
Say no. Say no.

42:41.017 --> 42:43.561
How she goes say

42:41.017 --> 42:43.561
yes or no? She is dead.

42:43.602 --> 42:45.563
Listen, I'm trying

42:43.602 --> 42:45.563
to make something--

42:43.602 --> 42:45.563
Let her wave.

42:47.232 --> 42:50.609
Hold her!

42:47.232 --> 42:50.609
Make sure she don't fall.

42:47.232 --> 42:50.609
Okay.

42:50.651 --> 42:52.070
Fix her hair.

42:54.655 --> 42:56.574
I don't even know

42:54.655 --> 42:56.574
how all of this happened.

42:57.658 --> 43:00.537
This was supposed to be

42:57.658 --> 43:00.537
the best weekend ever.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.621
- No, this is the worst

43:00.578 --> 43:02.621
weekend ever.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.621
- Yes.

43:02.663 --> 43:04.749
Listen, it's all going to

43:02.663 --> 43:04.749
be good. We're going to find out

43:02.663 --> 43:04.749
what happened to Simone

43:04.790 --> 43:06.584
and then everything

43:04.790 --> 43:06.584
will be back to normal.

43:06.876 --> 43:09.003
You guys, what about

43:06.876 --> 43:09.003
if we really did kill her?

43:09.045 --> 43:12.631
Would you stop it with all that?

43:09.045 --> 43:12.631
We don't even know if

43:09.045 --> 43:12.631
she was murdered, first of all.

43:12.673 --> 43:14.426
Yeah.

43:14.467 --> 43:15.968
And second of all,

43:14.467 --> 43:15.968
none of us are even

43:14.467 --> 43:15.968
capable of killing anybody.

43:16.010 --> 43:18.137
- Well, except for maybe Keke.

43:16.010 --> 43:18.137
- Not me.

43:20.181 --> 43:21.266
Well, you were with us so we

43:20.181 --> 43:21.266
won't even get into that.

43:21.307 --> 43:25.144
Wait, wait, wait. It's my

43:21.307 --> 43:25.144
husband Marques.

43:25.186 --> 43:27.021
- Oh, my God.

43:25.186 --> 43:27.021
- Answer it.

43:27.063 --> 43:28.647
- What do I do?

43:27.063 --> 43:28.647
- Answer it.

43:28.689 --> 43:30.149
Answer and act normal, Paige.

43:30.191 --> 43:31.609
Okay, okay, okay.

43:34.779 --> 43:37.656
Hello. Hi, baby.

43:34.779 --> 43:37.656
How you doing?

43:37.698 --> 43:39.658
Don't "baby" me

43:37.698 --> 43:39.658
like it's all good.

43:39.700 --> 43:42.203
Marques, why are

43:39.700 --> 43:42.203
you yelling at me?

43:42.745 --> 43:47.083
You trying to play me like

43:42.745 --> 43:47.083
I'm stupid. Well, I'm not

43:42.745 --> 43:47.083
stupid, Paige Davis.

43:47.125 --> 43:51.796
Wait, what are you talking

43:47.125 --> 43:51.796
about? You need to lower your

43:47.125 --> 43:51.796
voice, tone and delivery, okay?

43:51.837 --> 43:54.882
Ooh, that girl right now.

43:54.924 --> 43:56.259
She don't know what

43:54.924 --> 43:56.259
you're talking about.

43:56.301 --> 43:58.677
She's trying to tell me to lower

43:56.301 --> 43:58.677
my voice in my own h--

43:58.719 --> 44:01.055
lower my voice, I ain't

43:58.719 --> 44:01.055
going to-- you know

43:58.719 --> 44:01.055
what you need to do?

44:01.097 --> 44:04.058
You need to explain to me

44:01.097 --> 44:04.058
why I wake up in the morning

44:04.100 --> 44:07.686
to a video message

44:04.100 --> 44:07.686
from you from a strip club.

44:07.728 --> 44:10.356
- What's up with that? You don't

44:07.728 --> 44:10.356
even like strippers, Paige.

44:07.728 --> 44:10.356
- Apparently she do.

44:10.398 --> 44:12.984
What are you talking about? I

44:10.398 --> 44:12.984
would never go to a strip club.

44:13.025 --> 44:15.653
Lies, brother, lies, lies.

44:18.197 --> 44:19.698
Let her know--

44:18.197 --> 44:19.698
let her know now.

44:19.740 --> 44:24.120
You need to check your phone.

44:19.740 --> 44:24.120
You sent me a video message.

44:25.163 --> 44:26.664
Go ahead, check it!

44:27.415 --> 44:28.207
Wait.

44:29.750 --> 44:32.711
Let me give you all these

44:29.750 --> 44:32.711
quarters, all these quarters.

44:32.753 --> 44:35.131
My guy. Whoo!

44:35.173 --> 44:40.553
I wish you were here,

44:35.173 --> 44:40.553
big head. I'm doing it

44:35.173 --> 44:40.553
for the both of us.

44:42.138 --> 44:46.184
Oh my God. Girls, I sent him

44:42.138 --> 44:46.184
a video of us at the

44:42.138 --> 44:46.184
strip club last night.

44:46.809 --> 44:47.685
Damn!

44:48.227 --> 44:49.728
Okay, fine, you caught me.

44:49.770 --> 44:51.897
Oh shit, she fell!

44:51.939 --> 44:53.941
Oh, God. Oh, my god. She fell.

44:53.983 --> 44:55.776
- Oh, my toes.

44:53.983 --> 44:55.776
- It was an accident.

44:55.818 --> 44:57.487
Hurry up, grab her.

44:57.529 --> 44:58.946
I'm sorry. I'm gonna

44:57.529 --> 44:58.946
call you right back.

44:57.529 --> 44:58.946
I'm gonna call you back.

44:58.988 --> 45:01.157
Don't you break up, Paige,

44:58.988 --> 45:01.157
don't you-- don't you

44:58.988 --> 45:01.157
hang up this phone on me.

45:01.199 --> 45:03.700
It was accident.

45:01.199 --> 45:03.700
Just grab her.

45:01.199 --> 45:03.700
Pick her up.

45:04.785 --> 45:06.745
Okay, ready?

45:04.785 --> 45:06.745
Get my wig.

45:06.787 --> 45:08.747
Just grab

45:06.787 --> 45:08.747
her arms. Grab her legs.

45:06.787 --> 45:08.747
She's killing my wig.

45:08.789 --> 45:11.376
Ready? I'm going to get

45:08.789 --> 45:11.376
her from the middle.

45:08.789 --> 45:11.376
Ready, one, two, three.

45:11.792 --> 45:13.752
I got her arms.

45:11.792 --> 45:13.752
I got her arms.

45:11.792 --> 45:13.752
Girl body!

45:13.794 --> 45:15.712
Come on.

45:13.794 --> 45:15.712
One, two, three.

45:16.297 --> 45:17.756
This is one of my best wigs.

45:17.798 --> 45:19.800
Girl, ain't nobody paying

45:17.798 --> 45:19.800
attention to your wig.

45:19.842 --> 45:22.387
- We are going

45:19.842 --> 45:22.387
to San Francisco.

45:19.842 --> 45:22.387
- Are we?

45:22.428 --> 45:24.055
Yeah. We are going

45:22.428 --> 45:24.055
to San Francisco.

45:25.806 --> 45:29.435
I got eyes on them right now.

45:25.806 --> 45:29.435
Simone's still alive.

45:30.811 --> 45:33.814
She is with the same ladies that

45:30.811 --> 45:33.814
she was with earlier at lunch.

45:33.856 --> 45:35.983
You know we all will get

45:33.856 --> 45:35.983
into a lot of trouble for this.

45:36.025 --> 45:42.615
I know. I'm sorry. I'm just

45:36.025 --> 45:42.615
having a moment...

45:42.657 --> 45:45.117
Keke, what's that thing

45:42.657 --> 45:45.117
you always say?

45:45.159 --> 45:46.869
What happens in Vegas...

45:46.911 --> 45:48.538
Stays in Vegas.

45:49.746 --> 45:51.748
Okay, come on, we got to go

45:49.746 --> 45:51.748
make sure she's okay.

45:51.790 --> 45:53.084
Okay. Keke.

45:53.125 --> 45:55.002
- Come on, Paige,

45:53.125 --> 45:55.002
pull it together.

45:53.125 --> 45:55.002
- Okay.

45:57.505 --> 45:59.465
Alright, let's go.

46:01.050 --> 46:02.218
Guys, take

46:01.050 --> 46:02.218
the rope off of her.

46:02.260 --> 46:03.595
This?

46:02.260 --> 46:03.595
Yeah.

46:03.636 --> 46:05.012
Fix her hair. Okay.

46:03.636 --> 46:05.012
Right, right.

46:05.054 --> 46:06.805
Oh, here

46:05.054 --> 46:06.805
they are coming.

46:05.054 --> 46:06.805
She's good.

46:06.847 --> 46:08.057
- Okay. They are coming. Ready?

46:06.847 --> 46:08.057
Okay.

46:08.099 --> 46:08.891
Yeah.

46:10.142 --> 46:11.810
You guys stay here.

46:10.142 --> 46:11.810
Okay.

46:11.852 --> 46:15.398
- Hi. You must be Randy

46:11.852 --> 46:15.398
Haussmann and Alfred Tanner.

46:11.852 --> 46:15.398
- Hi.

46:15.440 --> 46:18.150
Such a pleasure to meet you.

46:15.440 --> 46:18.150
Simone has told us

46:15.440 --> 46:18.150
all about you two.

46:18.192 --> 46:20.737
Hope so. We're the two guys

46:18.192 --> 46:20.737
who're going to be buying

46:18.192 --> 46:20.737
Wellington Tech.

46:20.777 --> 46:22.113
Oh, yes. Wonderful.

46:22.154 --> 46:24.781
Simone. As punctual as ever.

46:25.575 --> 46:26.825
But no golf today?

46:26.867 --> 46:29.036
No, she's resting today.

46:30.288 --> 46:33.541
Okay, we're going to be playing

46:30.288 --> 46:33.541
the silent treatment now,

46:30.288 --> 46:33.541
huh, Simone?

46:35.876 --> 46:41.840
Well, Alfred and I have

46:35.876 --> 46:41.840
parsed this deal over and...

46:35.876 --> 46:41.840
one billion dollars.

46:41.882 --> 46:43.593
- One billion dollars, oh my!

46:41.882 --> 46:43.593
Keke.

46:43.635 --> 46:44.843
Oh my God.

46:43.635 --> 46:44.843
Focus.

46:44.885 --> 46:46.803
- Okay.

46:44.885 --> 46:46.803
Oh gosh.

46:44.885 --> 46:46.803
A billion dollars.

46:48.640 --> 46:49.641
You're right, Simone.

46:50.891 --> 46:53.603
She's too smart.

46:50.891 --> 46:53.603
We can't lowball this one.

46:54.771 --> 46:55.688
Pick it up.

46:57.523 --> 46:58.899
Two billion. How

46:57.523 --> 46:58.899
does that sound?

46:58.941 --> 47:01.736
Wonderful. Gentlemen,

46:58.941 --> 47:01.736
let's go this way.

47:01.778 --> 47:02.903
Let's go, shall we?

47:02.945 --> 47:06.532
Hi. My name is Paige Davis.

47:02.945 --> 47:06.532
How are you? Yes.

47:06.574 --> 47:12.413
Okay. Well, I am the president

47:06.574 --> 47:12.413
of sales and-- Tyra, Tyra, yeah.

47:12.455 --> 47:16.125
- Tyra is the head

47:12.455 --> 47:16.125
of programming, okay.

47:12.455 --> 47:16.125
- Hello.

47:16.167 --> 47:19.796
- And Keke over there,

47:16.167 --> 47:19.796
she is the head of lab security.

47:16.167 --> 47:19.796
Yes.

47:19.836 --> 47:21.880
So, what is it that

47:19.836 --> 47:21.880
you gentlemen said

47:19.836 --> 47:21.880
you were offering?

47:21.922 --> 47:22.839
- Yeah.

47:21.922 --> 47:22.839
- Well,

47:25.050 --> 47:30.139
we're offering enough that,

47:25.050 --> 47:30.139
well, quite frankly we'd like

47:25.050 --> 47:30.139
to speak directly to Simone.

47:30.181 --> 47:31.890
- I mean no

47:30.181 --> 47:31.890
offense, ladies.

47:30.181 --> 47:31.890
Yeah.

47:31.932 --> 47:35.561
I have to tell you this is all--

47:31.932 --> 47:35.561
all a bit strange.

47:35.603 --> 47:39.106
We received a call

47:35.603 --> 47:39.106
yesterday from Linda, it was,

47:39.148 --> 47:42.694
- who said that this deal was--

47:39.148 --> 47:42.694
this meeting was over.

47:39.148 --> 47:42.694
Mm-hmm.

47:42.735 --> 47:45.279
- And then we got a call today

47:42.735 --> 47:45.279
that said it was back on.

47:42.735 --> 47:45.279
- Oh.

47:45.321 --> 47:50.201
- And as I said, I'd really

47:45.321 --> 47:50.201
like to speak to Simone.

47:45.321 --> 47:50.201
- No, no.

47:50.242 --> 47:52.869
- You see, Simone is--

47:50.242 --> 47:52.869
- Mediating.

47:52.911 --> 47:54.622
- Mediating.

47:52.911 --> 47:54.622
Yeah, because--

47:52.911 --> 47:54.622
- Right.

47:54.664 --> 47:59.084
What happened is that

47:54.664 --> 47:59.084
Simone is in a deep stage

47:54.664 --> 47:59.084
of meditation right now

47:59.126 --> 48:02.380
and she said that--

47:59.126 --> 48:02.380
that I could speak for her.

48:02.421 --> 48:07.092
Oh boy. Well, we know

48:02.421 --> 48:07.092
when Simone doesn't talk

48:02.421 --> 48:07.092
that she means business.

48:07.134 --> 48:09.804
- You know her very well.

48:07.134 --> 48:09.804
- Exactly.

48:09.846 --> 48:11.180
We do?

48:11.222 --> 48:12.849
- I'll tell you what,

48:11.222 --> 48:12.849
let's not do this here.

48:11.222 --> 48:12.849
- Okay.

48:12.889 --> 48:15.518
Uh, how about dinner

48:12.889 --> 48:15.518
tonight at eight right

48:12.889 --> 48:15.518
after the conference?

48:15.560 --> 48:17.562
- You know what? Let me

48:15.560 --> 48:17.562
just check her schedule.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.562
Yeah.

48:18.312 --> 48:20.272
Simone, pass me the phone.

48:20.314 --> 48:22.817
What's that? Uh-huh. Yeah.

48:23.568 --> 48:25.944
Eight o'clock sounds great.

48:25.986 --> 48:28.155
- Simone would like

48:25.986 --> 48:28.155
to talk to you.

48:25.986 --> 48:28.155
- Okay.

48:28.197 --> 48:29.532
One sec. Okay.

48:30.991 --> 48:32.451
Okay, oh.

48:33.494 --> 48:35.287
What? You said what? No?

48:36.414 --> 48:38.957
- What's she saying?

48:36.414 --> 48:38.957
- Hey, I do whatever you say.

48:38.999 --> 48:40.917
You know, you're the boss.

48:38.999 --> 48:40.917
You're the boss lady.

48:42.086 --> 48:47.966
Um, yeah, Simone says that

48:42.086 --> 48:47.966
if you do a whole full business

48:42.086 --> 48:47.966
proposal by tonight,

48:48.008 --> 48:49.343
bam, you've got a deal.

48:50.010 --> 48:50.969
Mm-hmm.

48:51.011 --> 48:52.929
Well, yeah, I guess

48:54.014 --> 48:55.767
- eight o'clock will work.

48:54.014 --> 48:55.767
Great.

48:55.808 --> 48:57.059
- Okay, yeah, fantastic.

48:55.808 --> 48:57.059
Wonderful.

48:57.101 --> 48:59.604
Sorry to bother you, Simone.

48:57.101 --> 48:59.604
See you tonight?

48:59.645 --> 49:01.146
Okay, see you later.

48:59.645 --> 49:01.146
Okay.

49:01.188 --> 49:02.939
Yeah. Bye. Thank you, guys.

49:02.981 --> 49:04.692
Simone said don't be late.

49:04.734 --> 49:05.942
- She did?

49:04.734 --> 49:05.942
- Yeah.

49:05.984 --> 49:06.985
Right, Simone?

49:07.027 --> 49:08.738
- See, I heard it.

49:09.029 --> 49:11.323
Bye. See you.

49:09.029 --> 49:11.323
Thank you. See you tonight.

49:09.029 --> 49:11.323
Bye.

49:11.365 --> 49:14.869
So I guess we can mark Alfred

49:11.365 --> 49:14.869
and Randy off the list because

49:11.365 --> 49:14.869
they can't be suspects.

49:14.911 --> 49:16.788
They wouldn't offer

49:14.911 --> 49:16.788
that much money if they

49:14.911 --> 49:16.788
were going to kill her.

49:16.829 --> 49:18.247
Right. You're right

49:16.829 --> 49:18.247
about that, Lexy.

49:18.289 --> 49:19.916
We don't have a lot of time

49:18.289 --> 49:19.916
to figure this out.

49:19.956 --> 49:22.084
Well, now start

49:19.956 --> 49:22.084
looking for clues,

49:22.126 --> 49:24.169
you know, maybe things that are,

49:22.126 --> 49:24.169
you know, put out of place

49:22.126 --> 49:24.169
or something, I don't know.

49:24.211 --> 49:27.131
Maybe we can go back

49:24.211 --> 49:27.131
to the hotel and find something

49:24.211 --> 49:27.131
that was missing.

49:27.172 --> 49:28.215
- Good idea.

49:27.172 --> 49:28.215
- Right.

49:28.257 --> 49:31.009
Don't hotels have

49:28.257 --> 49:31.009
security cameras?

49:31.051 --> 49:32.720
Right.

49:32.762 --> 49:35.222
So, all we need to do is look

49:32.762 --> 49:35.222
at the hallway footage.

49:35.264 --> 49:38.601
This is a lot, seriously.

49:35.264 --> 49:38.601
I don't even know how

49:35.264 --> 49:38.601
we're going to do this.

49:39.226 --> 49:40.102
Alright.

49:42.062 --> 49:43.980
Good job on the

49:42.062 --> 49:43.980
security uniform.

49:44.148 --> 49:46.525
I got the security

49:44.148 --> 49:46.525
schedule from Greg.

49:46.567 --> 49:48.820
Okay. How'd you manage

49:46.567 --> 49:48.820
to do that, Lex?

49:48.861 --> 49:53.115
I have my ways. But listen,

49:48.861 --> 49:53.115
we got about thirty minutes

49:48.861 --> 49:53.115
before the lunch break is over.

49:53.157 --> 49:56.911
Within that thirty minutes

49:53.157 --> 49:56.911
no one is guarding the

49:53.157 --> 49:56.911
security room, okay?

49:56.953 --> 49:59.079
But it's not easy to get in to.

49:59.121 --> 50:02.082
Okay. Okay. I already got this.

49:59.121 --> 50:02.082
I've already checked out the

49:59.121 --> 50:02.082
hotel, I know the system.

50:02.124 --> 50:04.042
It doesn't seem like it's going

50:02.124 --> 50:04.042
to be that hard to crack.

50:04.084 --> 50:07.296
Perfect. Then you know

50:04.084 --> 50:07.296
what to do as soon as you get

50:04.084 --> 50:07.296
in the main security room.

50:08.088 --> 50:10.424
I'm going to go speak to the

50:08.088 --> 50:10.424
staff, see what I can get from

50:08.088 --> 50:10.424
them.

50:10.466 --> 50:12.551
Paige, you stay

50:10.466 --> 50:12.551
here with Simone.

50:13.051 --> 50:16.764
No, no, no, wait a minute.

50:13.051 --> 50:16.764
Why do I have to stay here

50:13.051 --> 50:16.764
and babysit Simone?

50:16.806 --> 50:19.350
Why can't Keke do it?

50:16.806 --> 50:19.350
Why can't I just go with Tyra?

50:19.391 --> 50:22.060
No offense, Paige,

50:19.391 --> 50:22.060
but you just don't seem

50:19.391 --> 50:22.060
like the security type.

50:22.102 --> 50:25.063
- Why not?

50:22.102 --> 50:25.063
- You're just not security

50:22.102 --> 50:25.063
material. That's all.

50:25.105 --> 50:27.859
Okay look, Paige, if you want

50:25.105 --> 50:27.859
to, you and I can switch.

50:27.900 --> 50:30.068
- Okay.

50:27.900 --> 50:30.068
- All you have to do is

50:27.900 --> 50:30.068
hack into the system.

50:30.110 --> 50:31.904
Okay.

50:31.946 --> 50:34.406
You have to steal

50:31.946 --> 50:34.406
the footage in the mainframe,

50:31.946 --> 50:34.406
reprogram the system

50:34.448 --> 50:38.076
and then wipe the hard drive

50:34.448 --> 50:38.076
so it looks like we were

50:34.448 --> 50:38.076
never there. It's easy.

50:38.118 --> 50:42.080
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think

50:38.118 --> 50:42.080
you're right, I'm going

50:38.118 --> 50:42.080
to stay here with Simone.

50:42.122 --> 50:43.958
What I'm doing?

50:44.000 --> 50:45.877
- You're going to be on lookout.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.877
- Once Tyra gets inside

50:44.000 --> 50:45.877
and does her thing,

50:45.918 --> 50:47.085
you're going to watch the door.

50:47.461 --> 50:50.422
But what if I got to pee and

50:47.461 --> 50:50.422
then somebody comes to the door?

50:50.464 --> 50:52.717
Okay. Okay, Keke,

50:52.758 --> 50:55.177
remember when you told me

50:52.758 --> 50:55.177
about your big moment in life?

50:55.219 --> 50:57.889
Like being a superhero one

50:55.219 --> 50:57.889
day and saving the world?

50:57.930 --> 51:01.099
Yeah, exactly. Just like that.

50:57.930 --> 51:01.099
Well, this is that moment.

51:01.141 --> 51:05.479
That's not saving the world.

51:01.141 --> 51:05.479
I'm not like disarming a bomb

51:01.141 --> 51:05.479
that's supposed to go off

51:05.521 --> 51:08.064
and kill a bunch of people

51:05.521 --> 51:08.064
like in the movies.

51:08.106 --> 51:13.069
Okay, Keke. Okay, Keke,

51:08.106 --> 51:13.069
um, that's never going

51:08.106 --> 51:13.069
to happen, okay?

51:13.111 --> 51:15.948
So, I need you to think

51:13.111 --> 51:15.948
smaller. Think small.

51:15.990 --> 51:16.991
Small?

51:17.033 --> 51:18.617
Can you do that

51:17.033 --> 51:18.617
for me Keke, please?

51:18.659 --> 51:20.244
I could do that, big sis.

51:20.285 --> 51:24.122
Okay, good. So, all we need

51:20.285 --> 51:24.122
you to do is stay and watch.

51:24.164 --> 51:25.374
I got you.

51:25.416 --> 51:28.544
Alright, great. Everybody know

51:25.416 --> 51:28.544
what they need to do? Good.

51:28.586 --> 51:33.089
We got less than two hours

51:28.586 --> 51:33.089
before Simone's speech.

51:28.586 --> 51:33.089
Let's go. I'll be right back.

51:34.842 --> 51:36.092
Okay, so. Okay.

51:53.986 --> 51:55.111
Wait, wait, wait.

51:56.072 --> 51:57.531
Hold on. Hold on.

52:28.228 --> 52:29.313
Oh, oh...

52:29.354 --> 52:32.066
Girl, what was that?

52:29.354 --> 52:32.066
You're going to hurt yourself.

52:32.108 --> 52:34.693
Too late. I didn't do

52:32.108 --> 52:34.693
that since high school.

52:34.735 --> 52:36.487
Okay, give me the keypad.

52:37.237 --> 52:38.154
Here.

52:55.798 --> 52:56.590
Perfect!

52:58.467 --> 53:00.136
Alright, we got twenty minutes

52:58.467 --> 53:00.136
before lunch is over.

52:58.467 --> 53:00.136
All I need is ten.

53:00.176 --> 53:02.554
- If anyone comes,

53:00.176 --> 53:02.554
you know what to do, right?

53:00.176 --> 53:02.554
- Yeah. Whodohoo!

53:08.519 --> 53:10.479
Girl. Mm-hmm.

53:10.521 --> 53:14.399
It's about to be lit tonight.

53:10.521 --> 53:14.399
Wait, this is ridiculous.

53:14.441 --> 53:17.235
What the hell do I look like

53:14.441 --> 53:17.235
talking to my dead boss?

53:17.277 --> 53:20.405
Wait, no, no, no. You know what?

53:21.490 --> 53:24.200
I really wish things would

53:21.490 --> 53:24.200
have been different but,

53:24.827 --> 53:28.747
hey, at least we have

53:24.827 --> 53:28.747
one-- at least we had

53:24.827 --> 53:28.747
one hell of a night.

53:28.789 --> 53:32.250
You know what I'm saying?

53:28.789 --> 53:32.250
A night to die for.

53:36.296 --> 53:37.589
You got it?

53:52.897 --> 53:55.149
Y'all don't know how to knock?

53:52.897 --> 53:55.149
You scared the hell out of me.

53:56.358 --> 53:59.235
Oh...

53:56.358 --> 53:59.235
- Paige, what are you doing here?

53:59.862 --> 54:01.279
With the body,

53:59.862 --> 54:01.279
what are you doing?

54:01.321 --> 54:03.615
What does it look

54:01.321 --> 54:03.615
like I'm doing?

54:03.657 --> 54:06.618
I'm doing her makeup

54:03.657 --> 54:06.618
for tonight's speech.

54:08.913 --> 54:11.289
Wait, did you get the footage?

54:11.331 --> 54:13.167
Yeah, it's right here.

54:11.331 --> 54:13.167
We got it.

54:20.132 --> 54:21.008
Get it in.

54:29.349 --> 54:30.266
Can you fast-forward?

54:32.686 --> 54:34.312
Wait, right there,

54:32.686 --> 54:34.312
right there. Zoom in.

54:34.354 --> 54:36.232
Two guys coming

54:34.354 --> 54:36.232
out of the room.

54:34.354 --> 54:36.232
Two guys.

54:36.272 --> 54:39.777
We need to figure out who

54:36.272 --> 54:39.777
these two guys are and

54:36.272 --> 54:39.777
turn them in to the police.

54:39.818 --> 54:42.029
Yeah. Who would

54:39.818 --> 54:42.029
want to kill Simone?

54:42.071 --> 54:43.822
Probably someone who didn't

54:42.071 --> 54:43.822
want the company to sell

54:43.864 --> 54:46.282
because they'd get cut

54:43.864 --> 54:46.282
out of the deal, like Lexy.

54:46.700 --> 54:47.785
No offense, Lexy.

54:49.078 --> 54:51.371
What? I watch "True

54:49.078 --> 54:51.371
Crime" on the ID channel.

54:51.413 --> 54:54.166
Besides Lexy, who wouldn't

54:51.413 --> 54:54.166
want the company to sell?

54:54.208 --> 54:55.918
Can we just keep my name

54:54.208 --> 54:55.918
out of it please?

54:55.960 --> 54:59.255
Right. Lexy

54:55.960 --> 54:59.255
couldn't kill a fly.

54:59.630 --> 55:00.714
Thank you.

55:00.756 --> 55:01.715
Then who?

55:03.759 --> 55:05.510
Linda.

55:05.552 --> 55:10.724
Linda's the only one that

55:05.552 --> 55:10.724
stands to lose something if

55:05.552 --> 55:10.724
the company sells to investors.

55:10.766 --> 55:13.227
I mean who knows what's going

55:10.766 --> 55:13.227
to happen if the company sells.

55:13.269 --> 55:15.353
Linda could lose her

55:13.269 --> 55:15.353
position like that.

55:15.395 --> 55:19.399
I mean I could too but I'm not

55:15.395 --> 55:19.399
as old as Linda is and I don't

55:15.395 --> 55:19.399
have that much invested.

55:19.441 --> 55:22.360
Technically you guys

55:19.441 --> 55:22.360
can lose your jobs too

55:19.441 --> 55:22.360
but that's not the point.

55:22.402 --> 55:23.319
The point is

55:25.114 --> 55:29.325
if Simone dies

55:25.114 --> 55:29.325
before the company sells,

55:25.114 --> 55:29.325
Linda inherits everything.

55:29.994 --> 55:32.246
Keke, you're a genius.

55:32.746 --> 55:33.538
I am?

55:34.456 --> 55:36.250
Yep, I am a genius.

55:36.667 --> 55:39.003
Oh my God, guys. Oh, my God.

55:39.753 --> 55:44.925
Linda must have had

55:39.753 --> 55:44.925
Simone killed before

55:39.753 --> 55:44.925
the company got sold.

55:45.509 --> 55:47.552
We kind of just figured

55:45.509 --> 55:47.552
that out, Paige.

55:47.928 --> 55:49.680
Right, right.

55:49.721 --> 55:52.348
And now we're going

55:49.721 --> 55:52.348
to take the fall for it.

55:52.390 --> 55:54.392
So, what we're going

55:52.390 --> 55:54.392
to do now, ladies?

55:54.434 --> 55:57.229
As long as they think Simone's

55:54.434 --> 55:57.229
alive, we're in danger.

55:57.271 --> 56:01.317
But if we let them know

55:57.271 --> 56:01.317
she's dead, then we

55:57.271 --> 56:01.317
could take the fall for it.

56:02.193 --> 56:06.238
Yeah, but we don't know who

56:02.193 --> 56:06.238
these two guys are and we don't

56:02.193 --> 56:06.238
even know if they're still here.

56:06.280 --> 56:09.074
You know, we should all go

56:06.280 --> 56:09.074
to the event as planned

56:09.116 --> 56:11.618
and just support Simone

56:09.116 --> 56:11.618
and act like nothing's wrong.

56:11.660 --> 56:13.954
Didn't y'all say Simone

56:11.660 --> 56:13.954
got a speech tonight?

56:13.996 --> 56:16.414
Don't worry about that.

56:13.996 --> 56:16.414
Keke, I have an idea.

56:16.456 --> 56:18.416
Okay, so I need you to stay

56:16.456 --> 56:18.416
in this room with Simone

56:18.458 --> 56:22.754
and under no circumstance

56:18.458 --> 56:22.754
allow anyone to come in this

56:18.458 --> 56:22.754
room. Can you do that?

56:22.796 --> 56:24.215
You already know I got you.

56:25.090 --> 56:27.843
Thank you, Keke.

56:25.090 --> 56:27.843
I'm really glad you came.

56:30.346 --> 56:31.387
Little sis.

56:31.763 --> 56:34.099
I'm glad I came too, big sis.

56:34.141 --> 56:35.142
Aw.

56:47.112 --> 56:49.489
Where in the hell are they?

56:51.407 --> 56:53.244
I can smell her.

56:51.407 --> 56:53.244
I know she's in here.

56:53.285 --> 56:56.872
I smell the cocoa butter

56:53.285 --> 56:56.872
and smell that Chanel No. 5.

56:53.285 --> 56:56.872
I know she's in there.

56:56.914 --> 56:59.457
They're here all upon

56:56.914 --> 56:59.457
that home wrecker.

56:59.499 --> 57:04.129
All upon and I mean

56:59.499 --> 57:04.129
Saturday night special

56:59.499 --> 57:04.129
all upon. I mean Beyoncé--

57:04.171 --> 57:06.924
Wait, no. You're here for me.

57:07.507 --> 57:09.343
My bad, brother.

57:07.507 --> 57:09.343
You know, I'm sorry.

57:09.385 --> 57:11.720
I can't right now. Get out of my

57:09.385 --> 57:11.720
face...

57:15.974 --> 57:18.185
Hi, how are you doing?

57:15.974 --> 57:18.185
I'm looking for my wife,

57:15.974 --> 57:18.185
Paige Davis.

57:18.227 --> 57:20.604
Could you please give me

57:18.227 --> 57:20.604
the information to her room?

57:20.645 --> 57:23.481
Sir, I do apologize but

57:20.645 --> 57:23.481
we can't give information

57:20.645 --> 57:23.481
on our guests.

57:23.523 --> 57:27.611
You don't understand.

57:23.523 --> 57:27.611
I'm her husband.

57:27.652 --> 57:29.487
We've-- we've traveled

57:27.652 --> 57:29.487
far to get here.

57:29.529 --> 57:32.408
Man, that's probably

57:29.529 --> 57:32.408
like an hour. It wasn't

57:29.529 --> 57:32.408
really that long.

57:32.950 --> 57:33.742
Not like that.

57:35.244 --> 57:37.621
I understand, but we can't give

57:35.244 --> 57:37.621
information on our guests.

57:38.414 --> 57:42.500
You don't understand. I need you

57:38.414 --> 57:42.500
to get my wife, Paige Davis.

57:42.542 --> 57:48.465
I'm her husband Marques Davis.

57:42.542 --> 57:48.465
You don't know who

57:42.542 --> 57:48.465
you're messing with.

57:48.506 --> 57:52.261
Somebody in here is

57:48.506 --> 57:52.261
going to catch a body! Whoo!

57:52.552 --> 57:54.721
I'm just saying, woman.

57:54.763 --> 57:57.515
Listen sir, I'm going to have

57:54.763 --> 57:57.515
to ask you to leave or I will

57:54.763 --> 57:57.515
have security escort you.

57:57.557 --> 57:59.226
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no.

57:59.268 --> 58:01.395
Oh, you don't know me.

58:01.437 --> 58:03.480
- We don't know. He don't know

58:01.437 --> 58:03.480
you. He don't know you. Sh.

58:01.437 --> 58:03.480
- I don't care who you are.

58:06.608 --> 58:08.526
I'm sorry, what did you

58:06.608 --> 58:08.526
say your name was?

58:08.568 --> 58:11.238
Samantha. And I'm going

58:08.568 --> 58:11.238
to need you to get your boy.

58:11.280 --> 58:12.864
- Oh, oh.

58:11.280 --> 58:12.864
- Sh!

58:13.449 --> 58:15.909
He's fine. It's just been

58:13.449 --> 58:15.909
a really long day.

58:15.951 --> 58:18.578
You have to understand like

58:15.951 --> 58:18.578
we came all the way down here

58:18.620 --> 58:21.498
to surprise his wife

58:18.620 --> 58:21.498
for their anniversary

58:21.539 --> 58:24.709
and to be honest,

58:21.539 --> 58:24.709
we've-- we've just got

58:21.539 --> 58:24.709
the runaround. So,

58:24.751 --> 58:28.672
if you could just help us

58:24.751 --> 58:28.672
find Paige Davis,

58:24.751 --> 58:28.672
that'd really be awesome.

58:29.173 --> 58:30.882
- Really.

58:32.592 --> 58:34.052
Hold on, give me a second.

58:36.305 --> 58:38.765
Mr. Johnson, can you please

58:36.305 --> 58:38.765
come to the front desk?

58:47.232 --> 58:48.233
What can I help you with?

58:48.650 --> 58:51.028
This gentleman says

58:48.650 --> 58:51.028
he's Mrs. Davis's husband.

58:52.237 --> 58:55.240
- Hi sir, you're

58:52.237 --> 58:55.240
Mrs. Davis's husband?

58:52.237 --> 58:55.240
- Yes, I am.

58:55.282 --> 58:57.534
Okay. Can I see

58:55.282 --> 58:57.534
some identification please?

59:00.537 --> 59:03.081
Thank you.

59:00.537 --> 59:03.081
And who's she a guest of?

59:03.123 --> 59:05.334
Mrs. Wellington.

59:08.712 --> 59:12.466
It does look like he's the

59:08.712 --> 59:12.466
husband. But we have

59:08.712 --> 59:12.466
a banquet going on, correct?

59:12.508 --> 59:13.550
Yes, we do.

59:15.802 --> 59:18.638
Sir, we currently have a banquet

59:15.802 --> 59:18.638
going on in the east villas

59:15.802 --> 59:18.638
and I do believe she's there.

59:18.680 --> 59:20.974
So, what I can do for you,

59:18.680 --> 59:20.974
I don't normally do this,

59:21.016 --> 59:22.934
but if you want to take

59:21.016 --> 59:22.934
a seat in the lobby,

59:22.976 --> 59:25.020
once it's done I'll give her

59:22.976 --> 59:25.020
a call and have her come out.

59:25.062 --> 59:27.064
- Thank you.

59:25.062 --> 59:27.064
- Sound good? Yes.

59:27.105 --> 59:28.899
- I appreciate you.

59:27.105 --> 59:28.899
- All right. Great.

59:29.858 --> 59:30.984
You're the man.

59:31.609 --> 59:33.362
The lobby is right

59:31.609 --> 59:33.362
over here, gentlemen.

59:33.404 --> 59:35.322
Oh no, we just got

59:33.404 --> 59:35.322
to go to the car and--

59:35.364 --> 59:37.408
- Real quick.

59:35.364 --> 59:37.408
- Get something out

59:35.364 --> 59:37.408
of it real quick.

59:37.449 --> 59:39.576
But we're going

59:37.449 --> 59:39.576
to come right back and--

59:37.449 --> 59:39.576
- Okay.

59:40.035 --> 59:41.703
- Thank you Mr. Johnson.

59:40.035 --> 59:41.703
Appreciate it.

59:40.035 --> 59:41.703
- You got it.

59:42.787 --> 59:44.789
- What do you mean we got it?

59:42.787 --> 59:44.789
- I'm just kidding.

59:58.678 --> 01:00:03.683
Since I am partner now,

59:58.678 --> 01:00:03.683
I think we should work together.

01:00:04.642 --> 01:00:06.103
I think we make a great team.

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:07.771
Do you not agree?

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.983
You just have nothing to say?

01:00:15.404 --> 01:00:16.613
You got to believe it.

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.076
Let me just cut to the chase.

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:26.664
I want in. Twenty-five percent

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:26.664
or I sing like a pop star.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:34.506
Sit down, get comfortable.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:34.506
Let me pour you some wine.

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:39.136
Come on. Come on.

01:00:40.429 --> 01:00:41.638
- Okay.

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:44.141
I like you, Lexy.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.810
I've always liked you.

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:49.854
And I like your style.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:51.648
Thank you.

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:53.984
But in this instance

01:00:55.444 --> 01:00:57.571
I don't think I know what

01:00:55.444 --> 01:00:57.571
you're talking about.

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:03.910
You know exactly

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:03.910
what I'm talking about.

01:01:05.703 --> 01:01:11.918
If Simone sells this company

01:01:05.703 --> 01:01:11.918
being sole owner of Wellington

01:01:05.703 --> 01:01:11.918
Tech, she retires a billionaire.

01:01:12.377 --> 01:01:13.504
But you,

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:18.509
you, the woman

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:18.509
who built this company,

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:18.509
walks away with nothing.

01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:21.428
Still having to work

01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:21.428
for new bosses.

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:24.806
That's if they decide

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:24.806
to keep you on.

01:01:25.516 --> 01:01:26.683
Come on, Linda.

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:29.645
We want the same thing.

01:01:30.395 --> 01:01:31.188
Simone dead.

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:38.445
And what do I

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:38.445
need you for again?

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:45.160
Because I'm getting the

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:45.160
feeling that you think I can't

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:45.160
handle this on my own.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.620
Well apparently not

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:51.542
because I know your first

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:51.542
attempt to kill Simone didn't

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:51.542
work because she's still alive.

01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:55.712
And the two guys you hired,

01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:55.712
they're ready to talk.

01:01:55.753 --> 01:02:01.385
You also have three

01:01:55.753 --> 01:02:01.385
other witnesses who

01:01:55.753 --> 01:02:01.385
can't wait to turn you in.

01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:11.687
- What do you want?

01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:11.687
- Like I said,

01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:11.687
twenty-five percent.

01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:16.149
I kill Simone for real this

01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:16.149
time, make sure it's done right.

01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:17.942
You get your guys

01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:17.942
to look like it's them,

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:21.572
I get my girls to develop

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:21.572
a serious case of amnesia.

01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:22.822
Twenty percent.

01:02:23.574 --> 01:02:25.783
Lucky and Dino

01:02:23.574 --> 01:02:25.783
will take the hit.

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:30.747
And you and your friends

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:30.747
can be very rich women.

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:35.419
One more thing.

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:40.006
Tyra and Paige keep their

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:40.006
position in the company.

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:44.595
Do we have a deal?

01:02:47.847 --> 01:02:51.017
Lexy, we're partners.

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:53.437
And around here we toast.

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:01.819
He said

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:01.819
it's on the inside.

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:01.819
- Yeah, inside.

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:03.780
Party got to be here. Come on.

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:08.744
No. They can't stop me.

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:08.744
You can't stop me.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.036
Right there, boom.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:13.123
What's going on?

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:13.123
Are they having a party?

01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:15.125
I know they are having a party.

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:20.088
That's right baby,

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:20.088
I'm coming for you, baby.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.839
Man, don't do that.

01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:24.801
- What's happening? Bro!

01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:24.801
- I don't know. I'm scared.

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:27.804
I'm-- I'm scared.

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:34.852
I can't.

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:34.852
I got you.

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:38.856
Marques, I'm stuck.

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:38.856
Oh, I'm stuck.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:40.858
- You okay? Come on.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:40.858
- Help me out.

01:03:42.694 --> 01:03:45.863
Man, you -- let's go

01:03:42.694 --> 01:03:45.863
find our wives, bro.

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:48.575
That's right. 'Cause she got

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:48.575
some explaining to do.

01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:50.868
Your wife being with her

01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:50.868
got some explaining to do.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:54.038
You got me jumping.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:54.038
- I'm not that, nigga. I told her

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:54.038
I want that nigga.

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:57.875
Get there, bitch.

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:01.755
Stop. Where are you going?

01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:07.385
Excuse me sir,

01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:07.385
my wife is in there.

01:04:07.427 --> 01:04:08.804
My wife-- my wife is in there.

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:11.014
- Are you guys

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:11.014
on the list tonight?

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:11.014
- I'm on the list.

01:04:11.055 --> 01:04:14.058
We're on the list. That's right,

01:04:11.055 --> 01:04:14.058
we are on the list. Davis.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.019
- Look at that.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.019
- What's your first name, sir?

01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:19.564
Marques.

01:04:20.982 --> 01:04:22.317
Sorry brother, I don't see

01:04:20.982 --> 01:04:22.317
you on the list anywhere.

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:24.569
So, unfortunately,

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:24.569
I'm not going to be able

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:24.569
to let you in tonight.

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:29.658
I'm sick of this, man! I'm going

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:29.658
to shut this shit down.

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.201
You're not going to keep

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.201
me from my wife, man.

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:33.286
You're not going to keep me

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:33.286
from my partner, brother.

01:04:33.328 --> 01:04:36.998
My wife is the president

01:04:33.328 --> 01:04:36.998
and I am the first man which--

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.627
anyway, she will care how

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.627
you're treating me out here

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.627
and that's not--

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:43.588
Look bro, I don't care

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:43.588
who your wife is or isn't.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:46.883
I'm overworked, I'm underpaid,

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:46.883
I make a minimum wage here.

01:04:46.924 --> 01:04:49.594
So, forgive me if I'm not as

01:04:46.924 --> 01:04:49.594
nice as you'd like me to be.

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:51.137
- Okay.

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:51.137
- Now take your midget

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:51.137
homie right here--

01:04:51.179 --> 01:04:53.931
Oh, I'm not his boy.

01:04:51.179 --> 01:04:53.931
Call me no midget.

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:56.893
- Boy, you got a problem?

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:56.893
- No, you just got some dust

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:56.893
on your shoulder, I was just--

01:04:57.977 --> 01:05:00.146
- I think we're good.

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:03.941
You're too tall for that,

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:03.941
brother. You're

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:03.941
wasting your life.

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:05.485
Yeah, that, yeah.

01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:07.529
That's a big ass.

01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:07.529
You should play some football.

01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:09.947
Thank you, thank you.

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:12.826
Good evening, everyone,

01:05:12.868 --> 01:05:17.581
and welcome to the sixteenth

01:05:12.868 --> 01:05:17.581
annual Wellington Tech

01:05:12.868 --> 01:05:17.581
Conference of America.

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:23.961
I'm so happy you

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:23.961
could make it tonight.

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:26.757
I know you're all expecting

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:26.757
to hear from Simone this evening

01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:30.218
but unfortunately she had

01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:30.218
an accident and she

01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:30.218
will not be joining us.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.720
Oh...

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.720
- But don't worry.

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:33.971
Here speaking

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:33.971
on Simone's behalf,

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:38.810
I have the President

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:38.810
of Sales, Miss Paige Davis.

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:45.567
Alright. Okay.

01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:47.944
Hi.

01:05:51.989 --> 01:05:53.950
What is technology?

01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:59.831
Um...

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:04.252
Simone Willington

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:04.252
wanted me to tell you

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:04.252
guys that she--

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:05.962
um,

01:06:07.255 --> 01:06:09.591
that she-- she's--

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:11.008
I--

01:06:13.762 --> 01:06:15.054
- Read this.

01:06:13.762 --> 01:06:15.054
- Okay.

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:28.151
Okay. She wanted me to read

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:28.151
you guys this so here I go.

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:32.572
Um...

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:37.994
"I cannot even begin

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:37.994
to take credit for this

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:37.994
incredible company.

01:06:38.536 --> 01:06:40.997
My business partner, Linda,

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.544
you have been there

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.544
by my side since day one.

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:49.005
I couldn't have accomplished

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:49.005
this without you.

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:56.721
And my team, my amazing team,

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:56.721
you guys give a hundred

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:56.721
and ten percent every day.

01:06:56.763 --> 01:07:03.019
So, at this time I'd like

01:06:56.763 --> 01:07:03.019
to announce the new President

01:06:56.763 --> 01:07:03.019
of Sales, Mrs. Paige Davis.

01:07:05.814 --> 01:07:07.190
That's me.

01:07:07.732 --> 01:07:10.234
I'm Paige Davis. Okay.

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:16.825
Simone is a visionary,

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:16.825
a woman of many talents,

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:18.827
someone we can all learn from.

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:24.040
No matter how hard

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:24.040
we try to stay alive,

01:07:25.082 --> 01:07:26.459
sometimes we die.

01:07:29.128 --> 01:07:30.046
Yeah!

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:34.050
But that's just

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:34.050
the circle of life.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:36.803
You know?

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:38.596
Okay.

01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:42.225
Well, we all know

01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:42.225
Simone's slogan,

01:07:42.893 --> 01:07:46.479
"I can do it." Come on guys,

01:07:42.893 --> 01:07:46.479
say it "I can do it."

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:48.899
"I can do it."

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.107
"I can do it."

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:51.985
Yes, you can!

01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:54.070
Yes, you can.

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:55.655
Yes we can.

01:07:56.364 --> 01:07:57.448
Oh, my God.

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:03.872
You can only imagine

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:03.872
the pain she felt when she

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:03.872
knew she couldn't make it.

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:10.127
But when she asked me,

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:10.127
the new President of Sales,

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:10.127
to do it, guess what I said.

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:13.172
- "Yes, I can."

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:13.172
Whoo!

01:08:13.214 --> 01:08:16.926
- Can everyone say

01:08:13.214 --> 01:08:16.926
"Yes, I can"? Yes, I can!

01:08:13.214 --> 01:08:16.926
- Yes, I can.

01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:18.094
Yes.

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:20.013
Yes, okay.

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.640
Yes, you can.

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:27.270
Goals

01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:30.189
are meant to be set

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:33.484
and records

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:33.484
are meant to be broken.

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:38.907
So, when you tell yourself

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:38.907
"I can do it" you damn well

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:38.907
better believe you can.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.323
Yeah.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.323
- Yeah!

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:47.999
Paige? What's Paige doing?

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:47.999
She got stage fright.

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:49.834
She ain't got it tonight.

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:53.046
Do you dare to dream? Where

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:53.046
are my dreamers at tonight?

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:54.965
Yeah.

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:54.965
- Come on. Don't be shy.

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:57.300
Where are my dreamers

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:57.300
at? I see you.

01:08:57.341 --> 01:09:00.011
Yes. I know right there.

01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:03.139
You know what?

01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:03.139
Martin had a dream.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:06.350
Kendrick had a dream.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:06.350
And I have a dream.

01:09:07.184 --> 01:09:12.064
So, we can all dream

01:09:07.184 --> 01:09:12.064
together. Let's dream.

01:09:07.184 --> 01:09:12.064
We can all have a dream.

01:09:12.107 --> 01:09:14.567
As long

01:09:12.107 --> 01:09:14.567
as it ain't a wet dream.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:19.196
What? Man, are you-- you're

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:19.196
always talking so much, you say

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:19.196
so much, you got a nasty mind--

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:22.198
Can I hear you say

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:22.198
"I can dream"?

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:25.996
- I can dream. I can dream, yes!

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:25.996
I can dream. I can dream.

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:32.961
I can dream. I can dream.

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:32.961
I can dream. I can dream.

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:38.215
So, to all the dreamers

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:38.215
here tonight and to all

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:38.215
the little people like me

01:09:38.256 --> 01:09:42.428
that didn't have anything

01:09:38.256 --> 01:09:42.428
growing up and the only thing

01:09:38.256 --> 01:09:42.428
they had was their dream,

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:44.263
never give up.

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:47.850
- Never give up no matter

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:47.850
what anybody tells you.

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:47.850
Yes.

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:49.935
- Believe in yourself.

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:49.935
Yes.

01:09:49.978 --> 01:09:53.229
- Believe in your dreams.

01:09:49.978 --> 01:09:53.229
There you go.

01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:57.110
Because one day

01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:57.110
they'll become true.

01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:58.653
Yeah.

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:00.196
Alright.

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:00.196
Yeah.

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:01.656
Yeah!

01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:06.119
Thank you. Goodnight.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.541
- How did I do?

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.541
- You did good.

01:10:11.582 --> 01:10:12.876
I did good?

01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:16.087
- I like that girl.

01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:16.087
- I see why Simone picked her.

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.925
So, what do you say

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.925
I fire up the jet later on?

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:25.388
I'm sitting here wondering

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:25.388
why this isn't done.

01:10:27.098 --> 01:10:28.558
We'll get it done.

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:31.769
Perfect.

01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:36.900
It was good.

01:10:36.941 --> 01:10:39.069
I must admit

01:10:36.941 --> 01:10:39.069
I was impressed.

01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:40.236
What was that?

01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:47.077
Gentlemen, come right in,

01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:47.077
you're right on time. Let's

01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:47.077
get down to business.

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:51.581
All right. Simone, you

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:51.581
remember Lucky, Dino?

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:53.457
Lexy? Yeah.

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:56.335
- You know these guys?

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:56.335
Yeah, you remember?

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:59.505
These are the two guys I was

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:59.505
telling you about from earlier.

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:07.346
Lexy, the only two guys

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:07.346
that you told us about was

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:07.346
the guys who killed Simon--

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:10.307
Oh! Those guys--

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:13.310
- I'm kind of scared now. I'm--

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:13.310
- What? Get it together!

01:11:13.352 --> 01:11:14.270
Where's Linda?

01:11:16.355 --> 01:11:17.440
Like, where is she at?

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.693
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.693
Hold on, wait a minute, guys.

01:11:20.735 --> 01:11:21.986
Put your guns down, okay?

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:24.948
They don't know anything.

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:24.948
My girls don't know anything.

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:26.365
- Get in there!

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:26.365
- Yeah, yeah.

01:11:30.161 --> 01:11:31.829
- And I got his back.

01:11:30.161 --> 01:11:31.829
- Whoo!

01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:33.330
Marques, you shouldn't be here.

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:37.334
- Be here? I know-- oh so you--

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:37.334
you rocking with the white boy?

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:37.334
No, no.

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:39.420
- You doing the swirl?

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:39.420
- No.

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:42.339
You're swirling here. You got my

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:42.339
sister here. That's what we

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:42.339
are, we are swirling?

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:43.841
Get over there.

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:47.095
We got college degrees.

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:47.095
We ain't messing with that.

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:47.095
We've got college degrees.

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:58.815
Someone please tell me

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:58.815
what the hell is going on here.

01:11:58.856 --> 01:12:00.900
I'll tell you what's

01:11:58.856 --> 01:12:00.900
going on here.

01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:05.446
About a billion of my dollars

01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:05.446
that I'll never get to see

01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:05.446
if Simone sells this company.

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:08.407
The new owners aren't

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:08.407
going to give a damn

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:08.407
about what I helped build.

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:11.619
The women power that Simone

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:11.619
and I always talked about,

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:14.413
they're just going

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:14.413
to get rid of the company

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:14.413
to some old bore guys

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:16.373
and there goes

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:16.373
my future as well.

01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:17.959
And why are you not dead?

01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:21.378
Lexy, I thought that you were

01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:21.378
going to take care of this.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.673
Well, Simone isn't

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.673
that easy to kill,

01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:26.759
especially with these idiots

01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:26.759
with her the entire time.

01:12:26.801 --> 01:12:29.179
Teddy Bear, what

01:12:26.801 --> 01:12:29.179
are you doing here?

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:30.847
He's with me.

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:35.643
What is she talking about?

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:35.643
We had sex.

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:37.895
You said it was sweet

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:37.895
like brown sugar.

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:39.480
Okay, that's too

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:39.480
much information.

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:42.358
Now, Lucky, this is how

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:42.358
it's going to go down.

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:58.415
I guess if you want something

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:58.415
done, you got to do it

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:58.415
yourself, huh, Lexy?

01:12:58.457 --> 01:13:01.377
Listen, we can still go through

01:12:58.457 --> 01:13:01.377
with the plan, alright?

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:03.504
You don't have

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:03.504
to kill anybody else.

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:09.219
Please don't kill us. Please

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:09.219
don't kill us. Listen, we are

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:09.219
not going to tell anybody.

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.428
We promise. We didn't

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.428
see anything, right y'all?

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.430
I didn't see

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.430
anything. I didn't see.

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:15.350
I-- I see

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:15.350
nothing, I'm legally blind.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.144
You're not going

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.144
to get away with this.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.144
- Oh yeah, says who?

01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:20.230
Linda, remember the deal.

01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:22.106
My girls said they

01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:22.106
didn't see anything.

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:25.484
You were here meeting

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:25.484
Simone, her killers burst

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:25.484
through the door,

01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:27.444
they tried to rob her,

01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:27.444
they shot her,

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:30.073
- you shot them in self-defense.

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:30.073
We're all witnesses.

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:30.073
Yes.

01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:31.991
- You get to walk away scot-free.

01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:31.991
Yeah, yeah.

01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:31.991
That's what happened.

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:35.411
Okay. That sounds good to me.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:37.747
I think I have a better plan.

01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:44.587
♪♪

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:04.815
Get off!

01:14:47.524 --> 01:14:49.819
- I'm losing blood.

01:14:47.524 --> 01:14:49.819
I'm losing blood.

01:14:47.524 --> 01:14:49.819
- What?

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:57.368
- I'm losing blood.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:57.368
- Keke, you're not shot.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:57.368
You're not shot.

01:14:59.578 --> 01:15:00.997
- What do we have here?

01:14:59.578 --> 01:15:00.997
- Oh!

01:15:02.957 --> 01:15:03.749
Lexy.

01:15:08.129 --> 01:15:09.672
You're welcome, Simone.

01:15:11.382 --> 01:15:15.678
Simone, you're alive? How?

01:15:11.382 --> 01:15:15.678
Wait, then who is that?

01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:20.683
That is me too, a fake me.

01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:20.683
Actually an exact replica.

01:15:20.724 --> 01:15:25.188
It's a new technology that we

01:15:20.724 --> 01:15:25.188
use just like a real person,

01:15:20.724 --> 01:15:25.188
only it doesn't breathe.

01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:27.564
Top-of-the-line, very expensive

01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:27.564
but worth every penny.

01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:29.233
She's just sitting

01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:29.233
there with my wig.

01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:31.735
Well, she really

01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:31.735
had me fooled.

01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:31.735
- My wig.

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:38.284
See, I knew what Linda was

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:38.284
planning, so I set her up along

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:38.284
with Agent Hopkins here.

01:15:38.326 --> 01:15:39.576
Agent?

01:15:39.618 --> 01:15:42.997
That's right, Agent

01:15:39.618 --> 01:15:42.997
Christine Hopkins, FBI.

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:47.584
When we found out that Linda was

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:47.584
trying to kill Simone, we set

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:47.584
up this whole sting operation.

01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:52.589
See, Simone always knew

01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:52.589
she could trust you ladies,

01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:52.589
along with Lexy, of course.

01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:55.592
Okay. So, what if things

01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:55.592
wouldn't have gone

01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:55.592
as planned, Lexy?

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:58.095
What if we would have

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:58.095
got shot? Paige and I

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:58.095
didn't have a vest.

01:15:58.137 --> 01:16:00.597
Yeah, that's some bull.

01:15:58.137 --> 01:16:00.597
I should have definitely

01:15:58.137 --> 01:16:00.597
gotten a vest.

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:02.433
You guys were never

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:02.433
in any danger.

01:16:02.475 --> 01:16:04.185
We had all eyes on you

01:16:02.475 --> 01:16:04.185
the whole time.

01:16:04.227 --> 01:16:05.186
Who eyes?

01:16:05.228 --> 01:16:06.603
I watched the whole

01:16:05.228 --> 01:16:06.603
thing go down.

01:16:06.645 --> 01:16:10.607
So, wait a minute, you mean

01:16:06.645 --> 01:16:10.607
to tell me that my plan

01:16:06.645 --> 01:16:10.607
wasn't a real plan?

01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:14.153
That my plan was already part

01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:14.153
of a planned plan? Wait, what?

01:16:14.653 --> 01:16:17.323
As crazy as it sounds, yes.

01:16:17.365 --> 01:16:22.245
But you ladies did good.

01:16:17.365 --> 01:16:22.245
We got the bad guys and Simone

01:16:17.365 --> 01:16:22.245
gets to retire as planned.

01:16:22.286 --> 01:16:23.079
But...

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:28.125
not before I offer you the

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:28.125
position of CEO at Wellington.

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:30.002
What?

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:30.002
- Oh, my--

01:16:30.044 --> 01:16:32.547
No one deserves it

01:16:30.044 --> 01:16:32.547
more than you, Paige Davis.

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:38.594
Oh, my God. Thank you.

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:38.594
Oh, thank you. Simone, thank

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:38.594
you so much. Thank you.

01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:41.638
And Tyra, come here, baby girl.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.849
We're going to be developing

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.849
a new smartphone

01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:47.270
to compete with Apple

01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:47.270
with the chip that you created.

01:16:47.644 --> 01:16:49.646
Someone needs

01:16:47.644 --> 01:16:49.646
to run that department.

01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:51.941
Thank you.

01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:51.941
I appreciate that.

01:16:51.982 --> 01:16:53.734
You girls

01:16:51.982 --> 01:16:53.734
are going to do very well.

01:16:54.693 --> 01:16:55.611
Excuse me.

01:16:56.571 --> 01:16:57.613
Yes, Simone here.

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:01.492
Yeah, Alfred,

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:01.492
I'll be right down.

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:01.492
I'll meet you in the lobby.

01:17:03.202 --> 01:17:04.870
It's time to go close this deal.

01:17:05.413 --> 01:17:06.539
Okay.

01:17:08.999 --> 01:17:11.043
- You ladies want

01:17:08.999 --> 01:17:11.043
to come with me?

01:17:08.999 --> 01:17:11.043
Why are you crying?

01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:11.877
Yes.

01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:17.049
Hey. You know,

01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:17.049
I really had a fun trip.

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:20.094
- Yeah.

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:20.094
- You know what?

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:20.094
We make a great team.

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:21.512
Actually, yes, we do.

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:25.475
- I'm good.

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:25.475
- Where's Keke?

01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:26.892
Keke, come here.

01:17:28.478 --> 01:17:30.563
You know, there's

01:17:28.478 --> 01:17:30.563
an opening at the Bureau.

01:17:30.605 --> 01:17:33.149
I'd love for you to come

01:17:30.605 --> 01:17:33.149
and train. I think you'll

01:17:30.605 --> 01:17:33.149
make a hell of an agent.

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:36.693
Secret agent? Like SHIELD?

01:17:37.111 --> 01:17:39.947
No, more like a regular

01:17:37.111 --> 01:17:39.947
agent, but yeah.

01:17:40.615 --> 01:17:43.033
Either way I want it.

01:17:40.615 --> 01:17:43.033
Count me in.

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:44.785
- Good.

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:44.785
- Keke.

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:53.252
- Well, on that note I'll say

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:53.252
goodbye. See you later.

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:53.252
- Bye, Lex.

01:17:54.044 --> 01:17:56.713
Agent Melvin Carter.

01:17:54.044 --> 01:17:56.713
Nice to meet you, Keke.

01:17:56.755 --> 01:17:59.509
No way, you're FBI too?

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:01.093
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you.

01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:03.971
I thought we had something.

01:18:04.388 --> 01:18:05.264
We did.

01:18:07.057 --> 01:18:09.977
So, what do you say we

01:18:07.057 --> 01:18:09.977
get out of here and do

01:18:07.057 --> 01:18:09.977
a little something again?

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:12.271
What do I call you?

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:16.609
Well, my name is Melvin

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:16.609
but right now why don't

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:16.609
you just call me Teddy Bear?

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:20.696
you of cheating.

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:23.949
Baby, I know

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:23.949
you're a good woman.

01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:27.495

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:30.706
and I don't ever have

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:30.706
to go anywhere else, okay?

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:33.584

01:19:07.577 --> 01:19:08.411
Okay.
