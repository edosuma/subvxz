00:37.496 --> 00:39.039
Oh, God. Me, too.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.707
You know, I just
saw Don Giovanni.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.210
In my opinion, the best opera
of the 18th century.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.753
Definitely.

00:44.837 --> 00:47.130
And the use
of recitative throughout...

00:47.214 --> 00:48.882
Mozart was a genius.

00:48.966 --> 00:53.470
Oh, yeah, reci-ta-teev is

You have no idea what I'm talking
about, do you?

00:58.350 --> 00:59.476
Sure, I do.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.019
Opera is bitchin'!

01:01.103 --> 01:04.314

Brian,
you're home early.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.411
What happened
with your date?

01:17.494 --> 01:18.620
Same thing that always happens.

01:18.704 --> 01:19.705
She was an idiot.

01:19.788 --> 01:20.998
Oh, Brian.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.534
I'll see you
next week.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.785
So what is it,
Brian?

01:58.869 --> 02:00.704
You don't think
these women understand you?

02:00.787 --> 02:02.956
You know, Lois,
I'm really not comfortable

02:03.040 --> 02:04.583
talking about this
a-melodically.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.418
Peter, I was wondering
if you could...

02:06.502 --> 02:08.253
Shh! Hang on
a second, Lois.

02:08.337 --> 02:10.380
And now back to The Life
and Times of Grizzly Adams.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.427
Um... Grizzly...
who's Steve?

02:15.511 --> 02:16.845
What?

02:16.929 --> 02:18.388
There's a message
on the machine

02:18.472 --> 02:19.848
from somebody
named Steve.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.141
Oh, yeah. Steve.

02:21.225 --> 02:23.644
Um... he's, uh...
new to the mountain.

02:23.727 --> 02:25.646
I met him down
at the general store.

02:25.729 --> 02:26.813
He makes canoes.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.857
Oh.

02:28.941 --> 02:30.859
How come
I've never met him?

02:30.943 --> 02:33.153
Mmm... He hasn't
really been here that long.

02:33.237 --> 02:34.863
Long enough
to get your number!

02:34.947 --> 02:37.241
Ben... Ben!

02:37.324 --> 02:38.992
Damn it.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.577
Look at that
Grizzly Adams, huh?

02:40.661 --> 02:42.871
Look at how confident
he is-- how majestic.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.498
Lois, I'm going
to grow a beard.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.333
Oh, Peter,
you know I hate beards.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.793
No, no, Lois.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.671
It's time I joined the ranks
of great men with beards.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.298
Why do you think Jesus Christ
was so popular? Huh?

02:53.382 --> 02:55.676
'Cause... 'cause
of all them magic tricks?

02:55.759 --> 02:57.219
Listen, Brian's very depressed.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.012
Could you and the guys
take him with you

02:59.096 --> 03:00.347
to the laser rock show tonight?

03:00.430 --> 03:02.391
Sure. If there's one thing
I'm good at doing

03:02.474 --> 03:03.600
it's cheering people up.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.270
Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey

03:06.353 --> 03:08.689
Jon-Benet's untimely
death is a tragedy

03:08.772 --> 03:11.275
and I will not rest
until I find her killer.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.693
Or killers.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.319
Oh, really, don't...
don't bother.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.280
Nothing's going to
bring our baby back.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.906
No, no, no. I insist.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.908
I will make it
my life's work to find out...

03:19.992 --> 03:21.326
We're fine!
Just drop it!

03:23.579 --> 03:26.874
MAN: The next laser rock show
will begin in 20 minutes.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.000
You hear that, Brian?

03:28.083 --> 03:29.084
A laser rock show!

03:29.168 --> 03:30.752
Come on.
Cheer up, would you?

03:30.836 --> 03:32.337
Aw, I don't
much feel like it.

03:34.173 --> 03:36.216
Binary code is the language
of computers

03:36.300 --> 03:37.801
in which words are translated

03:37.885 --> 03:39.636
into sequences
of zeros and ones.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.097
Anything at all can
be expressed in binary

03:42.181 --> 03:45.601
as we demonstrate in this famous
scene from The Miracle Worker.

03:45.684 --> 03:49.104
Zero-one-one-zero.
One-zero-zero-one.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.397
( speaking gibberish )

03:50.480 --> 03:53.400
Zero-one-one-zero.
One-zero-zero-one.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.403
Zero-one-one-zero.
One-zero-zero-one.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.364
Zero-one!
Zero-one!

04:04.244 --> 04:06.496
What? You don't think
this is amazing?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.999
When I saw this
at the 1904 World's Fair

04:09.082 --> 04:10.918
I nearly crapped my pants!

04:11.001 --> 04:13.462
All right!
Virtual reality!

04:13.545 --> 04:15.506
Whoa! You guys got to try this!

04:16.465 --> 04:17.799
Hey, look at me!

04:17.883 --> 04:19.134
I'm a pole in a strip club!

04:19.218 --> 04:21.762
Oh! It's show time!

04:21.845 --> 04:23.055
Uh... Oh, no! Oh, no!

04:23.138 --> 04:24.306
Oh! Oh! Hey, stop!

04:24.389 --> 04:25.974
False alarm!

04:26.058 --> 04:28.352
Oh, my God! I'm... I'm flying!

04:28.435 --> 04:30.479
I'm flying!

04:30.562 --> 04:32.523
Yes, I'll have a Diet Sprite.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.967
Okay, Johnny Depp
or Richard Grieco?

05:00.050 --> 05:01.593
Oh, that's gross!

05:01.677 --> 05:03.095
Yeah.
Let's not do this.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.806
Come on. If you're secure
in your masculinity

05:05.889 --> 05:07.724
you can answer
a simple hypothetical.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.142
All right, Johnny Depp

05:09.226 --> 05:11.228
'cause he kind of looks
like a chick, I guess.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.813
What about you, Peter?

05:12.896 --> 05:14.690
Oh, man. Uh...
uh... well, I don't know.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.942
Richard Grieco would
probably appreciate you more.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.777
You know, not
take you for granted.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.571
I mean, with
Johnny Depp, it's like...

05:20.654 --> 05:22.948
it's like he wouldn't
really need you, you know?

05:23.031 --> 05:24.700
He'd probably sneak out
after you fell asleep.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.034
Of course, with Johnny

05:26.118 --> 05:27.703
you'd get
the financial security.

05:27.786 --> 05:28.787
I... I'd go with Johnny.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.414
( siren wailing )

05:30.497 --> 05:31.623
Oh, great.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.002
Brian.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.004
Uh... hey, Joe.
How's it going?

05:37.087 --> 05:38.589
Pretty good.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.215
You were doing a little
swerving back there.

05:40.299 --> 05:41.592
Yeah. Yeah,
well, you know

05:41.675 --> 05:43.135
me and the boys
were just, uh...

05:43.218 --> 05:44.803
Whoa! You're off
the meter, Brian!

05:44.887 --> 05:46.221
You're under arrest.

05:46.305 --> 05:47.389
Oh, come on.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.183
Move it!

05:49.266 --> 05:50.934
Are one of you guys
all right to drive?

05:51.018 --> 05:53.020
Um... yeah. I can do it.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.771
( cans clattering )

05:54.855 --> 05:56.648
Great. I'll met you
at the Drunken Clam.

05:56.732 --> 05:57.858
We'll tie one on.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.026
I'm very disappointed in you.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.576
God! A DUI.

06:07.659 --> 06:08.827
I can't believe this.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.204
I could actually
go to jail.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.288
It's okay, Brian.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.664
You'll get
through this DUI

06:12.748 --> 06:14.416
and you'll be a
better person for it.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.834
Now, hold on
a minute!

06:15.918 --> 06:17.544
Don't disguise his alcohol dependence

06:17.628 --> 06:19.004
as a ticket to
self-realization.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.380
Look, you're
not one to talk.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.424
You remember that time
I gave you apple juice

06:22.508 --> 06:23.550
and told you
it was wine?

06:23.634 --> 06:28.514
I think you
are a special person.

06:28.597 --> 06:29.598
Thanks.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.016
No, now, come on.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.268
I'm... I'm being...
I'm being serious.

06:33.352 --> 06:36.355
I'm going to be serious
here for... for a second.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.608
Are you... are you going...
are you going to listen to me?

06:39.691 --> 06:41.652
Are you going
to listen to me so...

06:41.735 --> 06:43.862
so I can tell you
that I respect you?

06:43.946 --> 06:48.158
( drunken laughter )

06:48.242 --> 06:50.827
Now, Brian, I know
this is a bad time for you.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.746
And if I have any
advice to give you

06:52.829 --> 06:54.414
it is this: grow a beard.

06:54.498 --> 06:55.958
Peter, I wish
you'd shave that thing.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.084
Beards are so ugly.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.293
Hey!

06:58.377 --> 06:59.878
Oh, relax,
Wooly Willy.

06:59.962 --> 07:01.713
There's lots of fun things
you can do with that.

07:01.797 --> 07:02.923
There we go.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.049
Thanks.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.968
On the charge
of driving

07:06.051 --> 07:08.762
under the influence,
this court finds you guilty.

07:08.846 --> 07:09.972
( gasps )

07:10.055 --> 07:11.348
Yes! Good call!

07:11.431 --> 07:12.808
Churn the butter! Ooh-ooh!

07:12.891 --> 07:13.892
( sighs )

07:13.976 --> 07:15.561
In lieu of jail time

07:15.644 --> 07:18.188
I sentence you to 100 hours
of community service.

07:18.814 --> 07:19.815
Next item.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.400
Dearly beloved

07:21.483 --> 07:22.901
we are gathered here
to join these two

07:22.985 --> 07:24.278
in holy matrimony.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.530
If anyone objects
to this union

07:26.613 --> 07:29.032
speak now
or forever hold your peace.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.158
Quiet down.

07:30.242 --> 07:31.368
You had your chance.

07:33.704 --> 07:36.164
So what do you have to do
for your community service?

07:36.248 --> 07:38.625
I got assigned to the Outreach
to the Elderly Program.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.294
I got to take care
of some old woman

07:40.377 --> 07:42.504
who hasn't been out of her house
in 30 years.

07:42.588 --> 07:44.047
When I got
caught at school

07:44.131 --> 07:45.757
with my hand
down my pants

07:45.841 --> 07:48.093
I had to keep it there
for a whole week.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.720
Ha! What a week!

07:49.803 --> 07:51.221
I guess taking care
of this old woman

07:51.305 --> 07:53.682
will be just like baby-sitting,
only with bigger diapers.

07:53.765 --> 07:56.476
Aha! So they
do make bigger diapers!

07:56.560 --> 07:58.020
That deceitful
woman told me

07:58.103 --> 07:59.855
I'd have to learn
to use the toilet!

07:59.938 --> 08:01.440
Well, fie on the toilet!

08:01.523 --> 08:02.983
It's made slaves of you all.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.693
I've seen it sitting in there:

08:04.776 --> 08:06.778
lazy, slothful,
porcelain layabout

08:06.862 --> 08:08.655
feeding on
other people's doo-doos

08:08.739 --> 08:11.116
while contributing nothing
of its own to society.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.659
You get a job!

08:14.411 --> 08:16.288
( doorbell rings )

08:16.371 --> 08:17.664
Uh... Pearl Burton?

08:17.748 --> 08:19.750
Uh... my name's Brian.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.835
I'm here from the Outreach
to the Elderly Program.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.086
You're late.

08:23.170 --> 08:27.090
( many locks clicking )

08:27.174 --> 08:29.426
Ah! What
the hell is this?

08:29.510 --> 08:30.636
Delousing powder.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.638
Everyone on the outside
is filthy.

08:32.721 --> 08:33.805
You could have
given me some warning.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.015
Here's
your warning.

08:35.098 --> 08:37.100
It's going to burn
like hell in 30 seconds.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.102
Now, I like my tea at 4:00
and my dinner at 6:00.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.646
And I take my bath at
7:00 sharp

08:40.729 --> 08:41.980
so I can listen to Paul Harvey.

08:42.064 --> 08:43.357
You will warm up
my bathwater

08:43.440 --> 08:44.733
with quick bursts
from the faucet

08:44.816 --> 08:46.151
during commercials
only.

08:46.235 --> 08:47.903
It'll take you a while
to get the rhythm.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.738
Paul Harvey moves seamlessly
into commercials.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.114
By the way,
it's been 30 seconds.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.409
( screaming )

08:58.914 --> 09:00.791
Peter,
stop scratching that thing.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.459
I can't.
It's itching like crazy.

09:02.543 --> 09:03.919
Dad, can
I scratch your beard?

09:04.002 --> 09:05.546
Have you finished
your homework?

09:05.629 --> 09:06.755
Yes.

09:06.839 --> 09:08.173
Okay, then.

09:08.257 --> 09:09.883
( laughing )

09:09.967 --> 09:11.760
Brian, you've
been awfully quiet.

09:11.844 --> 09:13.554
Is the community service
not going that well?

09:13.637 --> 09:14.721
Oh, Lois, it's horrible.

09:14.805 --> 09:16.765
I was cleaning her house
all day.

09:16.849 --> 09:18.559
It's the worst job
I've ever had.

09:18.642 --> 09:19.643
Well, except for one.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.479
Uh... excuse me.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.898
Would you like to taste
my smoked meat log?

09:26.733 --> 09:27.734
Here you go.

09:27.818 --> 09:29.361
Enjoy your food.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.154
Enjoy your
studio apartment.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.324
Peter, you got a little
something right here.

09:34.408 --> 09:35.409
Where? Here?

09:35.492 --> 09:36.577
No, no, no.
Other side.

09:36.660 --> 09:37.995
Over here?
Left side, Peter.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.413
Your other
left side, Peter.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.664
Up a little.
Do I have it?

09:40.747 --> 09:42.082
Is it gone?
Up a little.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.500
Now go down.
Is it gone?

09:43.584 --> 09:45.669
( screaming ):
Oh, my God!

09:45.752 --> 09:48.005
Is it gone?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.965
Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off! Get it off!

09:50.048 --> 09:51.049
Hold still!
Hold still!

09:51.133 --> 09:52.342
Wait! Don't touch that bird!

09:52.426 --> 09:53.927
What's it to you, pal?

09:54.011 --> 09:56.555
I'm Dr. Goodman of the Quahog
Ornithological Society

09:56.638 --> 09:58.265
ironically dining
in a restaurant

09:58.348 --> 10:00.017
that exclusively serves poultry.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.351
Doctor,
what is this?

10:01.435 --> 10:03.145
Oh, it's a very
rare species:

10:03.228 --> 10:05.564
the endangered
White-Rumped Swallow.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.232
( giggling ):
Rump.

10:07.316 --> 10:08.609
This isn't funny,
Chris!

10:08.692 --> 10:11.069
( giggling ):
Swallow.

10:11.153 --> 10:13.197
Look, just get rid
of this bird, all right?!

10:13.280 --> 10:14.948
Unfortunately,
I can't do that.

10:15.032 --> 10:17.075
Once the swallow has chosen
its nesting place

10:17.159 --> 10:18.619
it's illegal
to disturb it.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.787
But he can't walk around
with a bird in his beard.

10:20.871 --> 10:22.122
I'm sorry. You have to wait

10:22.206 --> 10:23.790
until the bird departs
of its own accord

10:23.874 --> 10:24.875
or you'll be prosecuted

10:24.958 --> 10:26.335
to the full extent
of the law.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.420
Wow! You sure know
a lot of stuff.

10:28.504 --> 10:29.796
It's great to learn.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.089
ALL:
'Cause knowledge is power!

10:34.927 --> 10:36.803
What is this? Spit soup?

10:36.887 --> 10:37.888
Tomato bisque.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.474
What is this? Snot soup?

10:40.557 --> 10:41.558
Tomato bisque.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.645
What is this? Diarrhea soup?

10:44.728 --> 10:45.812
I'm not making
you anything else

10:45.896 --> 10:47.064
so just eat it.
All right?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.857
Fine. Then I'll have
to call the judge

10:48.941 --> 10:50.567
and that means
you'll go to jail!

10:50.651 --> 10:52.194
You're one phone call away

10:52.277 --> 10:55.364
from getting a human booster
shot from a guy named Molly.

10:55.447 --> 10:56.448
( sighs )

11:01.203 --> 11:04.122
( crunching )

11:08.502 --> 11:10.170
-Damn it all!
-Shh!

11:10.254 --> 11:11.380
-Shh!
-Shh!

11:11.463 --> 11:13.215
-Sorry. Sorry.
-( bird squawking )

11:13.382 --> 11:14.508
Shut up!

11:14.591 --> 11:15.717
Keep it down!

11:15.801 --> 11:17.469
There's nothing I can do,
all right?

11:17.553 --> 11:18.554
Take it
outside, pal!

11:18.637 --> 11:20.222
Look,
it's an endangered species!

11:20.305 --> 11:21.640
What am I supposed to do?

11:21.723 --> 11:23.517
I'll make you an
endangered species!

11:23.600 --> 11:24.935
Oh, oh, good comeback, Potsie!

11:25.018 --> 11:26.645
I'll kick your ass,
that's what I'll do!

11:26.728 --> 11:27.729
( all clamoring )

11:27.813 --> 11:29.273
Look, everybody just shut up!

11:29.356 --> 11:30.566
He has stopped squawking.

11:30.649 --> 11:31.733
He's receded into my beard.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.193
We can all watch the movie!

11:33.277 --> 11:34.528
Shut up!

11:34.611 --> 11:35.946
Eric,
if you're in here

11:36.029 --> 11:38.115
we're all going to Marty's
after the movie.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.286
Oh, I love
you so much.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.371
I love you, too, honey.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.747
( squawking )

11:45.831 --> 11:46.999
What's wrong?

11:47.082 --> 11:48.792
( squawking and screaming )

11:48.876 --> 11:50.669
That's it!
You're history, pal!

11:50.752 --> 11:51.795
No bird
Frenches my wife

11:51.879 --> 11:52.921
and gets away with it!

11:54.673 --> 11:58.051
PEARL:
Help! Help! I've broken my hip!

11:58.135 --> 11:59.219
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

11:59.303 --> 12:00.637
Brian!

12:00.721 --> 12:02.973
5.3 seconds.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.808
I could have been dead by now!

12:04.892 --> 12:05.976
What, you mean you're not...

12:06.059 --> 12:07.978
I heard you drop
that lightbulb, too.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.354
That'll be 67 cents.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.815
Now, go warm me up
some of that diarrhea soup!

12:11.899 --> 12:14.067
That's it! I have had it
with you, you old hag!

12:14.151 --> 12:16.653
Y-You're just a-a miserable,
dried-up shut-in

12:16.737 --> 12:19.406
trying to make everyone else
feel as bad as you do.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.117
Why don't you do the world
a big favor and drop dead!

12:26.914 --> 12:28.290
Uh, this last one won't open.

12:28.373 --> 12:29.458
You got to jiggle it
a little bit.

12:29.583 --> 12:30.584
Like... like this?

12:30.667 --> 12:31.668
Nah, here,
let me get it.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.003
Oh, thanks.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.923
And, uh, and,
you know, drop dead.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.049
( loud rock playing )

12:37.132 --> 12:42.763
Get out of my beard,
you squawking bastard!

12:42.846 --> 12:44.306
( sighing ):
Nothing.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.683
Well, I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.602
Oh, my God!
Peter, no!

12:48.685 --> 12:49.895
( both grunting )

12:49.978 --> 12:52.689
Lois, the bird must die!

12:52.773 --> 12:54.858
( both grunting )

12:57.569 --> 13:00.155
It's gone! It's gone!
Oh, thank God!

13:00.239 --> 13:02.366
-( chirping )
-Peter, what's that sound?

13:03.784 --> 13:06.078
Oh, my God, they're babies.

13:06.161 --> 13:07.496
Hey, look, Lois--

13:07.579 --> 13:10.082
there are three of them--
just like ours.

13:14.503 --> 13:15.921
And, uh...

13:18.340 --> 13:20.300
Sweet!

13:22.594 --> 13:24.930
We now return to E!'s
Mysteries and Scandals:

13:25.013 --> 13:26.849
"Pearl Burton,
the Jingle Queen."

13:26.932 --> 13:27.933
Pearl?

13:28.016 --> 13:29.142
I'm A.J. Benza.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.769
You won't find
Pearl Burton's name

13:30.853 --> 13:32.229
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame

13:32.312 --> 13:34.064
yet from 1945 to 1960

13:34.147 --> 13:36.400
you couldn't turn on
a radio or television

13:36.483 --> 13:38.944
without hearing
one of her trademark jingles.

13:39.027 --> 13:42.656
♪♪ You're only healthy
when you're tan ♪♪

13:42.739 --> 13:45.784
♪♪ So soak up
all the sun you can ♪♪

13:45.868 --> 13:49.872
♪♪ With copper Coppertone! ♪

13:49.955 --> 13:53.166
BENZA:At her peak, Pearl Burton
earned 26 grand a year

13:53.250 --> 13:54.751
which by today's standards

13:54.835 --> 13:56.795
would be just under
$49 billion.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.797
Brian, she's beautiful.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.925
Yeah, and-and that voice--
I... I had no idea.

14:02.050 --> 14:05.220
BENZA: In 1961, Pearl used
an appearance at Carnegie Hall

14:05.304 --> 14:08.015
to make the leap
from jingle singer to artist.

14:08.098 --> 14:11.810
( singing aria from Carmen
a cappella )

14:11.894 --> 14:13.937
That's "Habanera"
from Carmen.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.440
I've never heard it sung
so beautifully.

14:17.149 --> 14:18.150
Sing Coppertone!

14:18.233 --> 14:19.234
Yeah, Coppertone!

14:19.318 --> 14:20.402
Do Doan's Pills!

14:20.485 --> 14:22.821
Sing Gold Bond Medicated Powder!

14:22.905 --> 14:24.698
( audience booing
and shouting requests )

14:24.781 --> 14:26.575
No one has seen Pearl Burton

14:26.658 --> 14:29.036
since that fateful night
over 30 years ago.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.662
She's presumed dead.

14:30.746 --> 14:33.707
My God. And I said
all those awful things to her.

14:38.003 --> 14:39.755
( gasping :
Pearl!

14:45.344 --> 14:47.179
Come on, Pearl,
don't do this!

14:47.262 --> 14:48.722
You should be happy.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.016
I'm taking your advice
and doing the world a big favor.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.101
Now, move! Your fur
is making my feet sweat.

14:53.185 --> 14:55.395
Pearl, listen to me.
I heard you sing.

14:55.479 --> 14:58.732
It was the most beautiful sound
I've ever heard in my life.

14:58.815 --> 15:02.194
Oh, sure, warbling for
Vicks VapoRub and Dippity Do.

15:02.277 --> 15:03.403
No, no, Pearl, I mean...

15:03.487 --> 15:05.405
Oh, stop trying
to talk me out of it.

15:05.489 --> 15:07.032
I'm a pathetic sellout.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.992
No one who sings Carmen
like you is pathetic.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.244
What?

15:10.327 --> 15:12.120
I-I heard you
sing "Habanera."

15:12.204 --> 15:13.705
You were sublime.

15:13.789 --> 15:16.208
You... you liked my aria?

15:16.291 --> 15:17.626
I was overwhelmed.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.002
You're the first person

15:19.086 --> 15:21.129
who ever complimented
my "Habanera."

15:21.213 --> 15:22.589
Thank you.

15:22.673 --> 15:25.551
Well, I'd, uh,
I'd better get going.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.594
I'll, uh... I'll
see you tomorrow.

15:27.678 --> 15:29.137
But you're not
scheduled tomorrow.

15:29.221 --> 15:30.848
I know.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.521
( soft grunting )

15:55.414 --> 15:58.041
"And then the cow
came out of the barn."

15:58.125 --> 16:00.294
See? See? Look--
there's the cow.

16:00.377 --> 16:02.087
Now, what does a cow say?

16:02.171 --> 16:03.881
( chirping )
Yes, yes that's right--

16:03.964 --> 16:06.300
a cow says peep,
peep, peep, peep.

16:06.383 --> 16:09.386
You know, Peter, they're getting
awfully big. So?

16:09.469 --> 16:10.888
So every good mother knows

16:10.971 --> 16:12.848
when it's time for her babies
to leave the nest.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.725
Hey, they're free to go
anytime they want.

16:14.808 --> 16:15.851
Aah!

16:17.686 --> 16:19.688
Fine, I'll let them go.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.690
( operatic singing )

16:29.072 --> 16:31.366
Pearl, do you rent or own?

16:31.450 --> 16:32.576
Own what?

16:32.659 --> 16:34.953
Those wings, you angel.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.496
That was fantastic.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.165
That was so incredible!

16:38.248 --> 16:40.042
So, what do you want
for dinner?

16:40.125 --> 16:43.045
I was thinking about making us
that lamb and rice you love.

16:43.128 --> 16:45.214
You know, Pearl,
what I'd really like for dinner

16:45.297 --> 16:46.548
is, uh, to go out.

16:46.632 --> 16:48.884
Brian, you know I can't do that.

16:48.967 --> 16:51.178
I haven't left this house
in such a long time.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.763
I'm afraid.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.306
I know, but I'll be with you.

16:54.389 --> 16:56.683
