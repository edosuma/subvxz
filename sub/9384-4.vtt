Come on, honey.
He's been having accidents.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.314
Maybe he's trying to tell us he's ready.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.962

I'm washing them in fabric softener,

06:15.918 --> 06:18.253

you asked me if everything was okay.

Don't you want to pee
in a toilet bowl like a big boy?

all by myself.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.561
I was so proud.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.358
Hey, Lois! I did it!

06:40.484 --> 06:43.570
Well, perhaps I could give it
the old college try.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.114

06:46.698 --> 06:49.076
-It'll help me relax.
-Okay, buddy.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.372

can be psychological.

Take this one instead.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.466
That one's probably fine.

12:00.012 --> 12:01.138
Beautiful.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.561

Well, good-bye, Dr. Kaplan.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.420

I swear, I don't even remember doing it.
I don't understand this.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.796
Now, Brian,
we know you're not doing this on purpose.

13:15.879 --> 13:18.006
But maybe we should consider...

13:18.090 --> 13:19.842
-...crating.
-God.

13:19.925 --> 13:22.052
Or you could be an outside dog.

Would you like that?

13:25.305 --> 13:26.557
Outside?

13:28.100 --> 13:31.395
And how embarrassed was I
when the word "crate" came up?

13:31.478 --> 13:33.230
I thought I was past this.

the real issue yet. Drop it.

the last accident you remember...

13:44.199 --> 13:46.869
...did anything unusual happen
that might've triggered it?

Sure.

20:03.412 --> 20:05.706
...did your heart ever want
to ask something, but...

of what the answer might be?

Sometimes...

20:16.633 --> 20:17.843
Sometimes...

20:18.010 --> 20:20.429

for anything in the world.

for anything in the world either.

20:33.984 --> 20:35.277
I'm glad.

20:39.615 --> 20:42.910

-Yes.
