WEBVTT

00:01.573 --> 00:05.609
And then, he or she leaves
the money with the cashier

00:05.644 --> 00:07.411
and then brings home
the items you requested.

00:07.446 --> 00:08.844
Ian, it's impossible.

00:08.879 --> 00:10.845
You can't train a dog
to go grocery shopping.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.846
I can't even train you
to go grocery shopping.

00:12.881 --> 00:15.448
- Because that's dog work.
- Hey, wait, wait.

00:15.449 --> 00:18.816
Aren't you gonna offer to
help Mr. Norwood with his bags?

00:18.851 --> 00:20.583
Dad, if I offered to help every person

00:20.618 --> 00:24.519
carry their bags for them, they...
I could be rich.

00:24.554 --> 00:27.487
I'll call it
letmecarryallyourbagsforyou.com.

00:27.522 --> 00:29.088
That's a great idea.
You know why it works?

00:29.123 --> 00:31.923
'Cause you can picture it
on the side of an arena.

00:31.958 --> 00:34.390
- Ah, let me help you with these.
- Thanks, Mike.

00:34.425 --> 00:36.458
Next time, I'll splurge.
I'll buy some with wheels.

00:36.493 --> 00:40.493
Ah, sorry. Ian would've helped
you with your bags, but he...

00:40.528 --> 00:42.395
I don't even know how
to finish that sentence. Sorry.

00:42.430 --> 00:45.430
It's all right. Kids these days.
You know, they're in their own world.

00:45.465 --> 00:48.798
This whole twerking, you know,
I mean, is that a hell of a thing?

00:48.833 --> 00:50.799
Okay, is this it?

00:50.834 --> 00:53.100
I think we're over the weight limit.

00:53.135 --> 00:54.868
Hopefully, that's a ballpark number.

00:55.002 --> 00:56.803
<i>You must be going on quite a trip.</i>

00:56.837 --> 00:58.471
You know, I love New York.

00:58.505 --> 00:59.839
But there's one thing
New York doesn't have:

00:59.857 --> 01:02.742
- waterslides.
- Yeah, that's why they call it the...

01:02.776 --> 01:05.845
- city that never slides.
- When I was a kid, I loved waterslides.

01:05.879 --> 01:07.513
So as a treat to my younger self,

01:07.531 --> 01:09.749
I'm gonna take a waterslide
tour of the lower Southwest.

01:09.783 --> 01:11.217
So if anybody comes looking for me,

01:11.251 --> 01:14.987
- you tell 'em that's where I am.
- I'll be sure to spread the word.

01:16.790 --> 01:19.359
Hands up, Norwood!
You're under arrest.

01:19.593 --> 01:24.297
Man, they must take that weight
limit thing pretty seriously.

01:25.649 --> 01:28.717

<i><font color="yellow"> sync & correction by f1nc0

01:37.711 --> 01:39.879
There's a lotta cops down there.

01:39.913 --> 01:42.865
I can't believe there was a fugitive
living 10 feet from our children.

01:42.900 --> 01:46.669
I can't believe I missed the story.
Channel 6 got the scoop on this,

01:46.703 --> 01:48.638
and their weather map still
shows the Soviet Union.

01:48.689 --> 01:51.574
Eh, don't beat yourself
up, Dad. So you missed

01:51.575 --> 01:54.460
the fact that our neighbor
was an infamous mobster

01:54.494 --> 01:56.179
who's been in hiding
for the last 20 years.

01:56.230 --> 01:58.564
I mean, where's the story there?

01:58.582 --> 02:01.417
This just in..."local man's
love for daughter fading fast."

02:01.468 --> 02:02.969
Hey, if it makes you feel any better,

02:03.003 --> 02:05.271
- Norwood had everyone fooled.
- Not me. I always knew

02:05.289 --> 02:08.758
- there was something up with that guy.
- You knew?

02:08.809 --> 02:10.776
The guy whose shirt is on
backwards and inside out.

02:10.811 --> 02:13.663
- And it's my shirt.
- Yeah, well, I found it in my drawer.

02:13.714 --> 02:17.600
Makes the guns pop.
Bingo. Bango.

02:17.651 --> 02:21.287
Okay, what do we tell Graham?
Because he was friends with Norwood.

02:21.321 --> 02:24.924
- There are a lot of police outside.
- That's true.

02:24.942 --> 02:28.711
They're here to take
Mr. Norwood to a farm.

02:28.762 --> 02:32.432
- A farm?
- That worked with his gerbil.

02:32.466 --> 02:35.034
I thought they were taking
him to jail for being a mobster.

02:35.052 --> 02:36.936
And they're pretty
much raising themselves

02:36.970 --> 02:39.005
- at this point.
- Yeah, yep.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.125
Hey, Harris.
What are you doing here?

02:42.159 --> 02:44.110
Hey, Leigh.
This is a little awkward,

02:44.144 --> 02:45.978
but after our thing the other night,

02:45.996 --> 02:47.880
- I think I left my watch.
- Oh, yeah.

02:47.915 --> 02:50.933
I can't tell you how my
guys have left stuff here.

02:50.984 --> 02:52.785
I mean, not that many.

02:52.820 --> 02:55.254
Just like the regular amount
for a woman my... come in.

02:55.288 --> 02:59.842
- I'll just look for the watch.
- Oh, this is a nice place. 

02:59.877 --> 03:03.396
It looks different with my clothes on.

03:03.430 --> 03:06.065
Well, I don't see any
watches, but it could...

03:06.099 --> 03:07.316
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

03:07.367 --> 03:08.835
I'm sorry.

03:08.869 --> 03:11.454
Maybe I could interest
you in some cufflinks.

03:11.488 --> 03:13.689
No, well,

03:13.740 --> 03:15.875
if the watch turns up,
you know where to find me.

03:15.909 --> 03:19.228
Look, the other
night was a lot of fun.

03:20.497 --> 03:24.817
- Huh?
- But it can't happen again.

03:24.852 --> 03:28.287
- Can you imagine with Mike?
- Oh, yeah.

03:28.321 --> 03:30.389
With his boss and best friend
sleeping with his sister?

03:30.424 --> 03:33.176
He would not handle that well.

03:33.210 --> 03:37.263
Let's just chalk this
up to a one-time thing.

03:37.297 --> 03:39.398
Or maybe a two-time thing.

03:39.433 --> 03:42.869
- But now, really, this has got to be it.
- Otherwise, what?

03:42.903 --> 03:44.820
We start sneaking around
so Mike won't find out?

03:44.855 --> 03:47.139
Running off at odd hours
of the night, you know,

03:47.173 --> 03:49.075
coming up with elaborate cover stories.

03:49.109 --> 03:51.244
Wearing wigs to
each other's apartments

03:51.278 --> 03:54.580
- so we wouldn't be recognized.
- Yeah.

03:54.615 --> 03:58.519
It sounds... awful.

04:01.024 --> 04:05.260
Okay. So a three-time thing.

04:08.512 --> 04:12.731
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

04:12.749 --> 04:15.001
So according to Cha...
Channel 6,

04:15.035 --> 04:17.786
our old neighbor stole a
lotta money over the years,

04:17.821 --> 04:19.906
most of which is unaccounted for.

04:19.940 --> 04:23.376
Luckily, we had
someone on the inside.

04:23.410 --> 04:24.994
You know, Graham,

04:25.028 --> 04:27.480
sometimes the best way to
deal with losing a friend

04:27.514 --> 04:29.648
is to talk about everything
he's ever said to you.

04:29.666 --> 04:31.667
A few days ago, he gave me a statue,

04:31.718 --> 04:34.020
told me to hang on
to it for safekeeping.

04:34.054 --> 04:37.456
Those are his exact words?
"Hold on to it for safekeeping"?

04:37.491 --> 04:40.560
Graham, do you know how
valuable this statue could be?

04:40.594 --> 04:44.063
- Where'd you put it?
- Um...

04:44.081 --> 04:47.033
Maybe we'll get lucky
and it'll be on top.

04:48.602 --> 04:52.672
- At least it's dry.
- Yeah, it...

04:58.612 --> 05:00.930
I don't think they're gonna find it.

05:00.964 --> 05:03.248
<i>And you know how they say</i>

05:03.267 --> 05:06.352
<i>that no one ever makes it out
of a North Korean prison alive.</i>

05:06.386 --> 05:08.738
I may have missed the Norwood story,
but my intuition was

05:08.739 --> 05:10.956
still sharp enough to know
that Susan was about to rip into me.

05:10.974 --> 05:13.843
Well, it's true.
I mean, when I finally left there,

05:13.894 --> 05:17.613
I was clinically dead.
I mean, I saw god.

05:17.664 --> 05:18.998
- Hi, Mike.
- Damn it!

05:19.016 --> 05:22.385
Excuse me for a minute.
Hey, Mike, you have a second?

05:22.436 --> 05:24.020
All right, let's hear it.
I know you've probably been

05:24.071 --> 05:25.671
saving up Norwood jokes all morning.

05:25.706 --> 05:27.707
- Give me your best shot.
- What are you talking about?

05:27.741 --> 05:29.708
That could've happened to
anyone, I mean, all we have to

05:29.726 --> 05:31.677
care about now is where
Norwood stashed that cash.

05:31.711 --> 05:34.847
Wow. Cool.
I appreciate your professionalism.

05:34.865 --> 05:36.482
- I'm right on it.
- Good.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.001
If you need any help, just
ask my new assistant Al.

05:39.052 --> 05:41.237
- Al Capone.
- I'm her assistant, see?

05:41.271 --> 05:43.022
I'm sorry, Mike, she's
making me do this.

05:43.056 --> 05:46.092
This is all you got?
You got Doug in a cheap, rented suit?

05:46.126 --> 05:47.493
- This is my suit.
- I was expecting

05:47.511 --> 05:51.797
phone calls from Tony Soprano all day,
or a horse's head on my chair.

05:51.815 --> 05:53.866
- You're losing your touch.
- Yeah, maybe.

05:53.900 --> 05:57.119
But then again, you know,
I'm not the investigative journalist

05:57.170 --> 05:59.422
who had no idea that there was
a fugitive right under my nose.

05:59.473 --> 06:00.940
At least I've been
working with the same nose

06:00.974 --> 06:02.908
- my whole career.
- Ooh. Golly, Mike.

06:02.943 --> 06:05.961
You always manage to get the last laugh.

06:07.714 --> 06:10.399
And there's a stuffed
horse's head on my chair.

06:12.786 --> 06:14.486
<i>Harris.</i>

06:14.504 --> 06:17.223
<i>- Huh?
- There you are.</i>

06:17.257 --> 06:19.058
Listen, I know what
you're thinking, buddy,

06:19.092 --> 06:21.077
and let me just promise you...
I haven't lost my touch.

06:21.111 --> 06:23.395
Mike, I guarantee you
that's not what I was thinking.

06:23.413 --> 06:26.048
Because the thing is I thought
I could come back to work

06:26.083 --> 06:30.419
and just pick up where I left off,
but that's unfair to me.

06:30.470 --> 06:33.055
- Yeah, totally unfair, so...
- What it boils down to is...

06:33.106 --> 06:35.007
- Right, right. Boil it.
- I've been out of the game

06:35.025 --> 06:37.335
for a while, but like any
great athlete, it's gonna

06:37.336 --> 06:39.645
take me a while to get those
muscles back in shape again.

06:39.663 --> 06:41.330
Yeah, so get back out
there, champ! Immediately.

06:41.365 --> 06:42.981
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

06:42.999 --> 06:44.784
I'm gonna get an exclusive
interview with Norwood,

06:44.818 --> 06:46.585
and I'm gonna find out
where that money is.

06:46.620 --> 06:48.337
No need to know the process.
Just dazzle me with the results.

06:48.372 --> 06:54.176
I will, 'cause from now on...
nothing gets by me.

06:59.999 --> 07:02.301
That was close.

07:02.335 --> 07:04.770
Maybe we shouldn't do this
at your office anymore.

07:04.805 --> 07:07.673
Yeah, you're right.
Anyone can see us.

07:07.691 --> 07:12.177
It's just an...
unnecessary... risk.

07:14.197 --> 07:18.619
- I'll lock the door.
- Don't.

07:19.018 --> 07:21.120
You wanna be bad?
You wanna be bad?

07:21.154 --> 07:23.383
<i>You wanna be bad, huh?</i>

07:25.049 --> 07:29.145
<i>I've been worried Norwood may had
a bad influence on the kids. </i>

07:29.179 --> 07:32.114
I was making a statement to the police
when they were taking him away.

07:32.132 --> 07:34.216
Graham accused me of flipping.

07:34.251 --> 07:37.820
Annie, you're a great mother.

07:37.854 --> 07:41.874
One mobster isn't gonna undo years
of loving and attentive parenting.

07:41.925 --> 07:44.226
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

07:44.260 --> 07:48.130
You're acting super weird today.
You didn't second-guess my parenting.

07:48.165 --> 07:50.833
You didn't call any of the
girls at anthropologie a bitch.

07:50.867 --> 07:54.937
You haven't complained
about the royal baby once.

07:54.971 --> 07:57.757
- You're seeing someone.
- No.

07:57.791 --> 07:59.792
Yes, you are!
You're seeing someone!

07:59.843 --> 08:02.011
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Since when?

08:02.029 --> 08:03.562
You always talk about the guys you date!

08:03.614 --> 08:06.365
You even told me about the
undercover CIA agent you were seeing,

08:06.416 --> 08:09.585
- and that was technically treason.
- He wasn't a CIA agent.

08:09.603 --> 08:13.255
He played a CIA agent...
in a confidence scheme...

08:13.290 --> 08:16.592
that I fell for.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.978
So why would you wanna
keep this guy a secret?

08:19.012 --> 08:21.314
<i>Unless...</i>

08:21.348 --> 08:25.134
you think maybe he's the one,
but you're afraid you'll jinx it.

08:28.088 --> 08:31.340
That's it. Exactly.

08:31.374 --> 08:34.860
Now, let's change the subject
before we ruin my relationship.

08:34.910 --> 08:38.947
Hey, say no more!
I totally respect your privacy.

08:38.965 --> 08:40.466
What's Leigh's email password?

08:40.500 --> 08:42.183
I thought you were
gonna respect her privacy.

08:42.219 --> 08:43.669
Well, that's just something people say.

08:43.703 --> 08:44.870
Yeah, something people
who respect privacy say.

08:44.921 --> 08:48.291
I know who it is.
It's the doorman.

08:48.292 --> 08:50.559
I've definitely noticed them flirting.

08:50.593 --> 08:52.712
Oh, Mike.
He would be so good for her.

08:52.746 --> 08:56.298
He's courteous, responsible,
always opens the door for you.

08:56.333 --> 08:58.834
You realize you're just
describing a doorman, right?

08:58.852 --> 09:01.103
Besides, if he's into
anyone, he's into me.

09:01.121 --> 09:04.340
 No, I'm serious.
Whenever he has a delivery,

09:04.374 --> 09:05.641
he always puts a little
spin on the word "package."

09:05.676 --> 09:08.060
- Nice.
- That's what he says.

09:08.111 --> 09:12.048
- You have enough questions for Norwood?
- I... I think so.

09:12.082 --> 09:14.216
I had to strong-arm the D.A.
to get an hour with this guy.

09:14.251 --> 09:17.553
I gotta make it count.
The people deserve answers.

09:17.571 --> 09:20.380
My husband, so noble and relentless.

09:20.415 --> 09:22.792
Then I'm gonna rub those answers
in Susan's stupid face.

09:22.826 --> 09:27.496
- Also a little bit petty.
- It's "penis", by the way.

09:27.531 --> 09:29.315
I'm in.

09:31.134 --> 09:35.037
So it must get lonely down here,
opening doors for people all day.

09:35.072 --> 09:38.007
You have anybody special at
home opening doors for you?

09:38.041 --> 09:43.913
- I have a, uh, doorman at my place.
- No, I mean...

09:43.947 --> 09:46.916
- I mean, are you seeing anybody?
- Ah. 

09:46.950 --> 09:50.586
Andy, it's me!
It's Mrs. Henry from 5A!

09:50.604 --> 09:52.204
I used to call you Adam for a while.

09:52.239 --> 09:54.006
- You can talk to me.
- Okay, yes.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.208
There is someone, but we're
trying to keep it quiet.

09:56.259 --> 09:59.779
- My job makes it... complicated.
- Complicated. Gotcha.

09:59.813 --> 10:01.397
Just so you know...

10:01.431 --> 10:02.648
<i>I'm rooting for you and Leigh.</i>

10:02.699 --> 10:04.633
Leigh?

10:04.668 --> 10:07.415
The woman in 1A that keeps
badmouthing the royal baby?

10:07.450 --> 10:09.889
No. No.
No, my girlfriend's name is Tricia.

10:09.940 --> 10:13.843
The mail lady?
Why does that need to be a secret?

10:13.877 --> 10:17.046
Oh, it would be quite the scandal
in the lobby community.

10:17.047 --> 10:19.249
It really would.

10:19.816 --> 10:24.019
- Harris?
- Hey! Annie!

10:24.037 --> 10:29.391
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to see, uh... Mike.

10:29.426 --> 10:31.393
And bring him flowers.

10:31.427 --> 10:34.947
- Flowers?
- Yeah, that's right.

10:34.998 --> 10:37.116
You know, I think it's sad
that a male friend can't bring

10:37.167 --> 10:39.251
another male friend
flowers just because.

10:39.302 --> 10:40.803
I mean, I don't mean
to direct this at you.

10:40.837 --> 10:43.639
It's about society as a whole.
Well, anyway, what's new with you?

10:43.673 --> 10:45.391
Give me the latest on Annie Henry.

10:45.425 --> 10:47.793
Oh, I'm just preoccupied
with this whole Leigh thing.

10:47.828 --> 10:52.815
Oh, Leigh, your sister-in-law, right?
Yeah, what about her?

10:52.849 --> 10:55.184
She's dating some guy,
won't say who it is.

10:55.218 --> 10:58.687
And apparently... he's the one.

10:58.705 --> 11:02.324
Really? The one?

11:02.342 --> 11:05.594
Uh, yeah, yeah, what...
what fun for her...

11:05.628 --> 11:09.498
and whoever the guy might be.
Listen, I gotta go.

11:09.533 --> 11:11.733
So make sure Mike puts those
in water with a crushed aspirin.

11:11.751 --> 11:14.086
They'll last longer.

11:16.807 --> 11:21.060
- You have to pu...
- Yeah.

11:21.111 --> 11:24.947
- Yeah, and you go through it.
- Ease out...

11:24.981 --> 11:30.186
Mike. Mikey!
You are a sight for sore eyes.

11:30.220 --> 11:33.889
- I gotta tell you, prison's really rough.
- Not enough waterslides for you?

11:33.923 --> 11:36.525
You know, they say that you should
beat up a guy the first day. Heh.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.362
Easier said than done. A lot of
these guys, they're really strong.

11:40.397 --> 11:42.398
Well, I'm sorry to
hear that, Mr. Norwood.

11:42.432 --> 11:45.401
Or should I say
Joey "the Lip" Baldino?

11:45.435 --> 11:50.939
This guy was going down.
Two men enter, one man leaves.

11:50.957 --> 11:54.543
Of course, the other man was
handcuffed to the table, but still.

11:54.578 --> 11:57.580
Let's dive right in.
Millions of dollars are unaccounted...

11:57.614 --> 11:59.081
Before we get into that,
can I ask you something?

11:59.115 --> 12:01.783
Shoot, Joey.
Uh, figure of speech.

12:01.801 --> 12:03.469
You really didn't know who I was?

12:03.503 --> 12:07.866
I mean, really?
How could you not know?!

12:07.901 --> 12:10.824
You lived next door to me for ten years!

12:11.310 --> 12:14.630
That, sir, is a bald-faced lie.

12:14.648 --> 12:16.952
It was actually 11.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.462
So you had no clue.

12:22.001 --> 12:24.068
I mean, whenever we would
watch Goodfellas together,

12:24.102 --> 12:25.937
I'd sit on the couch.
I'd be yelling...

12:25.938 --> 12:29.274
- "No! No! No! They got it all wrong!"
- Well, I definitely noticed

12:29.308 --> 12:30.925
you were a bad person
to watch a movie with.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.910
But it's not like we spent
that much time together.

12:32.928 --> 12:34.412
What are you talking about?

12:34.446 --> 12:37.031
You used to come over to play poker.
Man, you'd clean up.

12:37.066 --> 12:40.101
Yeah, when you move as much as
I do, everything seems like a tell.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.936
Yeah. That's why the
guys loved you so much,

12:41.971 --> 12:43.671
which is probably why
they never shook you down.

12:43.706 --> 12:47.742
So these poker games involved
some of your associates?

12:47.793 --> 12:50.678
- On occasion.
- So would you say

12:50.729 --> 12:52.463
I successfully infiltrated
your poker game?

12:52.481 --> 12:57.585
- Not really.
- Could you say it?

13:03.709 --> 13:05.977
<i>...how bad I smell?
Ugh, is there still yogurt in my hair?</i>

13:06.011 --> 13:08.563
<i>- Yes, everywhere.
- Ugh.</i>

13:08.614 --> 13:11.115
- Hey, guys, great seeing you.
- Yeah, great for you, maybe.

13:11.133 --> 13:12.717
We spent the last two
days in the garbage.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.352
You know, a lot of people

13:14.386 --> 13:16.471
throw out handfuls of
band-aids down that chute.

13:16.505 --> 13:19.791
In the future when a
mobster gives you a statue,

13:19.825 --> 13:22.827
- you don't throw it out.
- Well, again, great seeing you.

13:22.861 --> 13:25.713
Why arare you being so weird?
Hey.

13:25.764 --> 13:28.900
- Hey, what's under that pillow?
- This is my private space.

13:28.934 --> 13:32.303
Oh.
Well, yeah, that checks out.

13:32.338 --> 13:34.255
All right, then.
Hey, we'll just be on our...

13:34.306 --> 13:35.306
Sneak attack!

13:35.340 --> 13:36.491
- Aghh!
- The statue!

13:36.525 --> 13:40.545
- Graham! Why did you lie to us?
- Because you said it was valuable,

13:40.579 --> 13:42.446
and I'm gonna trade it to
friend Ben for a cool rock.

13:42.464 --> 13:44.703
- No!
- Are you crazy?

13:44.738 --> 13:47.017
Graham! There's probablyomething
really valuable inside,

13:47.036 --> 13:49.821
like a stolen diamond or an
even more valuable owl statue!

13:49.855 --> 13:51.589
We gotta break it open!

13:51.623 --> 13:55.059
N...you can't break this open.
This is crime memorabilia.

13:55.094 --> 13:57.395
We can sell this online
and get like $500.

13:57.429 --> 13:59.997
You know what's cooler than $500?
$5 million.

14:00.032 --> 14:02.817
Uh, yeah.
No one's arguing the other side of that.

14:02.851 --> 14:04.102
I'm just saying if we break this open,

14:04.136 --> 14:06.854
and there's nothing inside,
then it will be totally worthless.

14:06.905 --> 14:08.706
- You're worthless!
- I want the rock!

14:08.741 --> 14:11.075
<i>Whoa! No!
Don't just stand there!</i>

14:11.093 --> 14:13.194
<i>Graham!</i>

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:25.190 --> 14:27.325
I caught it! Did you see that?

14:27.359 --> 14:29.877
Wait, I wanted it to break.

14:29.928 --> 14:31.379
Oh!

14:31.430 --> 14:33.097
Could you guys kill
each other more quietly?

14:33.132 --> 14:34.382
I'm trying to get through
Aunt Leigh's emails.

14:34.416 --> 14:37.368
Oh! Great.
Mom can be the tiebreaker.

14:37.402 --> 14:40.171
Okay, so Mr. Norwood
gave Graham this owl

14:40.205 --> 14:41.872
a few days before he was arrested.

14:41.890 --> 14:43.324
- Ian wants to break it open.
- Yeah.

14:43.358 --> 14:46.828
Graham wants to trade it for a rock,
and I want to sell it on ebay.

14:46.879 --> 14:51.132
All good ideas. I'm gonna
go with none of them.

14:51.166 --> 14:56.421
- Okay, we're taking that to the police.
- Oh, Mom. You're the worst.

14:56.455 --> 15:01.826
- Hey. Never speak against the family.
- Thank you, Graham.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.562
Maybe Norwood wasn't
such a bad influence.

15:04.596 --> 15:09.166
- Forget about it.
- Okay, I think he... yeah, he was.

15:13.922 --> 15:18.008
- Leigh.
- Damn it! You knew it was me?

15:18.026 --> 15:20.611
I thought for sure this would
throw people off the scent.

15:20.629 --> 15:23.548
You know, this is why you
never cheap out on a wig.

15:23.582 --> 15:25.733
No, I was just not
expecting to see you tonight.

15:25.767 --> 15:29.704
I don't feel so great. Do
not eat scallops in winter.

15:29.738 --> 15:31.655
Oh. We don't have to go to dinner.

15:31.673 --> 15:34.825
We could just stay in and
watch a show on Netflix.

15:34.843 --> 15:36.677
I've heard good things about
Lilyhammer,

15:36.728 --> 15:38.846
but it's two seasons so
it's kind of a commitment.

15:38.897 --> 15:43.308
- I don't want a commitment!
- Oh. All right, this is weird.

15:43.309 --> 15:46.670
- What's going on?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

15:46.688 --> 15:50.074
You know, Annie told me what you
said about me being "the one,"

15:50.108 --> 15:53.044
and don't take this
personally, but uh-uh.

15:53.078 --> 15:56.797
Oh, relax, buddy.
I just said that to Annie

15:56.832 --> 15:58.282
so that she would get off my back.

15:58.317 --> 16:01.952
Believe me, if there is "a one",
it is definitely not you.

16:01.970 --> 16:05.178
Oh, thank god.
You know, it's just...

16:05.179 --> 16:09.426
I'm happy with the way things are going.
You know, actually,

16:09.444 --> 16:11.529
I can't remember the last
time I had this much fun.

16:11.563 --> 16:13.364
To tell you the truth,

16:13.382 --> 16:15.666
this is all I think about
when we're not together.

16:15.700 --> 16:18.336
Yeah, me too.
I can't get you off my mind.

16:18.370 --> 16:20.087
And I can't concentrate
at work because I'm...

16:20.122 --> 16:22.073
Just thinking of ways
to sneak off to see you.

16:22.107 --> 16:24.025
Yeah!

16:27.079 --> 16:31.475
- Does that mean...
- Maybe you are the one.

16:33.051 --> 16:34.869
- Damn it.
- Damn it.

16:34.903 --> 16:36.153
<i>It's all right.</i>

16:36.188 --> 16:37.555
Oh, hey, Mike, what are you doing,

16:37.573 --> 16:39.056
looking at the footage
of your interview?

16:39.074 --> 16:40.825
- Yep. It's a triumph.
- Oh, good.

16:40.859 --> 16:42.627
- So much good stuff.
<i>- Don't you remember?</i>

16:42.661 --> 16:44.495
<i>You gave me that spare
key to your apartment?</i>

16:44.513 --> 16:46.130
<i>Mike: Yeah, but that was
just to water my plants.</i>

16:46.164 --> 16:47.798
<i>And when I get home, I'm counting them.</i>

16:47.832 --> 16:49.217
Almost too much.
Let me turn this off.

16:49.268 --> 16:50.818
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Bill! Randall!</i>

16:50.852 --> 16:52.320
<i>Come here! 
Come here!</i>

16:52.354 --> 16:54.822
<i>- This is the guy I was telling you about!
- Oh, no! No, no, no.</i>

16:54.856 --> 16:57.474
<i>This is Mike Henry!
He had no clue! Honest to god.</i>

16:57.492 --> 16:59.310
It turns out Bill and
Randall were big fans.

16:59.328 --> 17:02.997
Mm-hmm. Well, that's good,
Because they're our key demographic.

17:03.031 --> 17:04.315
- I signed a few autographs.
- Uh-huh.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.834
In crayon, 'cause it's hard
to make a shiv out of a crayon.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.618
Yeah, I know how
to make a shiv, Mike.

17:08.653 --> 17:11.756
You know what, Mike? I think
you've done enough on this project.

17:11.790 --> 17:13.656
I'm gonna follow the money
trail from here on out, okay?

17:13.675 --> 17:16.460
- We'll see about that.
<i>- He had no idea they were</i>

17:16.493 --> 17:19.576
<i>- filled with cash.
- Could somebody turn this off?</i>

17:21.856 --> 17:24.825
Susan wants take over
the Norwood story.

17:24.859 --> 17:26.174
I don't know.
Maybe it's for the best.

17:26.239 --> 17:28.249
I'm tired of dealing
with that sociopath.

17:28.300 --> 17:29.801
And Norwood.

17:29.835 --> 17:31.502
Mike, the interview's
gonna cut together fine.

17:31.536 --> 17:33.354
I mean, you got a great angle.

17:33.388 --> 17:35.323
What you don't know about
your neighbor may surprise you.

17:35.357 --> 17:37.508
Ooh!
Am I on the wrong side of the mic?

17:37.543 --> 17:39.610
- Because that sounded good.
- I don't know, Harris.

17:39.645 --> 17:41.762
Maybe five years is too
long to be out of the game.

17:41.814 --> 17:44.048
There was a time when
nothing would get by me.

17:44.066 --> 17:47.685
Like the creases in your shirt tell
me it's the spare one from your desk,

17:47.719 --> 17:50.054
which means you slept over
at a woman's last night.

17:50.072 --> 17:51.823
Maybe I just sat weird.

17:51.857 --> 17:53.324
And apparently, her
apartment is near mine.

17:53.358 --> 17:55.392
W-w-what would make you say that?

17:55.410 --> 17:57.620
You got a poppy seed in
your tooth, and you only like

17:57.621 --> 17:59.831
the poppy seed bagels from
the deli in my neighborhood.

17:59.865 --> 18:02.283
I had a craving.
And it's only 40 blocks.

18:02.334 --> 18:07.705
Well, that explains that.
But what it doesn't explain... is this.

18:07.739 --> 18:12.343
- Well, this isn't marshalls.
- How did you know she was in there?

18:12.377 --> 18:14.846
I didn't even know she was in there.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.514
I was waiting for the
right moment to surprise you.

18:16.548 --> 18:18.082
Well, it would've
been more of a surprise

18:18.100 --> 18:19.750
If you didn't reset
the thermostat to 75.

18:19.768 --> 18:22.803
- Harris likes it cool.
- You know, he does run hot.

18:22.855 --> 18:25.422
He usually has to take
a cold shower right after we...

18:25.440 --> 18:26.807
Well, I should've known.

18:26.859 --> 18:30.761
I can't keep a secret from Mike Henry.
You haven't lost a step.

18:30.779 --> 18:33.231
I mean, you're like Batman
crossed with the Mentalist.

18:33.265 --> 18:35.483
Ooh, I watched the
hell out of that show.

18:35.534 --> 18:39.487
Well, objectively speaking,
that thermostat thing was inspired.

18:39.538 --> 18:41.989
- I scare myself sometimes.
- You know what?

18:42.040 --> 18:47.495
- The bat mentalist, he doesn't gloat.
- Mike, what about us? Are you mad?

18:47.546 --> 18:51.332
What, about you two?
No, you're both...

18:52.371 --> 18:54.467
sort of adults.

18:55.137 --> 18:56.921
What do you have to say about that?

18:56.955 --> 18:58.839
I guess we don't have
to sneak around anymore.

18:58.891 --> 19:00.558
Yeah.

19:00.592 --> 19:05.096
- We don't have to sneak around anymore.
- No more wigs...

19:07.432 --> 19:12.049
- Huh.
- Huh.

19:14.239 --> 19:16.274
Sorry we got your statue taken away.

19:16.308 --> 19:17.525
But we found some cool
stuff from the tra...

19:17.576 --> 19:21.078
- Store. From the store.
- Yeah.

19:23.916 --> 19:27.625
All right. We're square.

19:29.087 --> 19:31.822
<i>Life's funny.
You wake up every day with no idea</i>

19:31.840 --> 19:34.658
<i>of what you might discover.</i>

19:37.796 --> 19:40.565
<i>Maybe it's love.</i>

19:40.599 --> 19:42.833
What do you mean, you can't
get me in to see Norwood?

19:42.851 --> 19:45.937
Oh, it didn't pan out?
Well, maybe you're not gonna pan out.

19:45.971 --> 19:48.785
Oh man, you've gotta stop crying.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.559
Listen, a lot of people's
wives are pregnant.

19:51.610 --> 19:54.061
<i>Or sometimes, it's
the answer to a mystery.</i>

19:54.112 --> 19:56.631
If you're still following
the money trail, you might

19:56.632 --> 19:59.150
check into the house Norwood's
mother bought last month.

19:59.184 --> 20:02.019
It's a pretty big purchase for a woman
who's been dead for five years.

20:02.037 --> 20:05.790
Wh... there's no... there's no...
How did... how did you know this?

20:05.824 --> 20:07.124
Well, it's an old
money laundering trick.

20:07.159 --> 20:12.461
It's something you pick up if you
play poker with your neighbors.

20:12.631 --> 20:14.248
<i>And sometimes these things
turn out to be a surprise.</i>

20:14.299 --> 20:17.368
So Harris and Leigh broke up.

20:17.386 --> 20:20.087
<i>And sometimes they play out
pretty much how you expected.</i>

20:20.138 --> 20:21.922
Did you know he was
the one she was dating?

20:21.974 --> 20:24.809
Of course, I knew.
I gave them my blessing.

20:24.843 --> 20:28.346
I figure if I hadn't, they would've
gotten married just to spite me.

20:28.380 --> 20:31.148
So what are we gonna do with this guy?

20:31.183 --> 20:33.267
Well, I told the kids we were
taking him to the police, so...

20:33.318 --> 20:35.102
- Break it wide open?
- That's what I'm thinking.

20:35.153 --> 20:37.521
Oops.

20:37.555 --> 20:42.326
- Parkinson's.
- Hey! Hey! Hey! What's this?

20:44.246 --> 20:46.280
It's a letter.

20:46.331 --> 20:51.535
"But no matter what you find,
never stop searching."

20:51.569 --> 20:55.906
Well, that's...
total nonsense.

20:55.924 --> 20:58.376
"Bet on endless summer
to win the derby."

20:58.410 --> 21:00.344
Wait a minute. This is...

21:00.379 --> 21:03.329
Five years old.
Already checked.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.469
Damn it!

21:07.648 --> 21:11.286
