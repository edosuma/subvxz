Please!

01:02.798 --> 01:03.368
Please!

01:08.177 --> 01:08.769
Help me!

01:12.775 --> 01:14.742
Help me!

01:14.777 --> 01:17.712
[crying]

01:45.709 --> 01:47.445
Pushed, you think?

01:47.480 --> 01:50.217
Yeah, or jumped or fell,
but no blood up here, though,

01:50.252 --> 01:53.616
so she was shot down there.

01:53.651 --> 01:55.222
Pushed, jumped, or fell.

01:55.257 --> 01:57.224
Shot in the back of the
head, dragging herself away.

02:00.493 --> 02:01.525
My god, that's awful.

02:05.498 --> 02:08.202
I hope we didn't pull you
away from the lovely Rita.

02:08.237 --> 02:09.632
Is that how this
is going to go?

02:09.667 --> 02:11.634
Rita's sprinkled into
every conversation now?

02:11.669 --> 02:13.735
Oh, of course not.

02:13.770 --> 02:15.803
Except yeah.

02:15.838 --> 02:19.136
But it's good, though.

02:19.171 --> 02:21.138
Last week, we would pulled
you away from, what,

02:21.173 --> 02:22.579
a can of soup and Jeopardy?

02:22.614 --> 02:23.976
You know what?

02:24.011 --> 02:25.219
There's nothing wrong
with soup and Jeopardy.

02:25.254 --> 02:26.715
They happen to
complement one another.

02:26.750 --> 02:28.849
The vehicle's registered
to Maggie Moore.

02:28.884 --> 02:30.521
Lives a few miles from here.

02:30.556 --> 02:31.588
You sent Maggie Moore?

02:31.623 --> 02:32.589
Weird, right?

02:32.624 --> 02:36.087
[music playing]

02:53.612 --> 02:56.041
So, did she take the
ring back, your wife?

02:56.076 --> 02:57.713
Nope.

02:57.748 --> 02:59.583
Unbeknownst to me., I entered
into a marriage contract,

02:59.618 --> 03:02.520
and she's entitled
to certain niceties.

03:02.555 --> 03:03.785
Niceties?

03:03.820 --> 03:06.524
The fuck is that?

03:06.559 --> 03:07.789
What the hell, man?

03:07.824 --> 03:08.856
Oh, it's fine.

03:08.891 --> 03:09.692
You just cut it off.

03:09.727 --> 03:10.693
Yes, not fine.

03:10.728 --> 03:11.892
This is fucking mold.

03:11.927 --> 03:13.366
It's just not edible.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.401
You know, you're paying
me $0.20 on the dollar.

03:15.436 --> 03:16.732
It's eat-able enough.

03:16.767 --> 03:17.601
Edible.

03:17.636 --> 03:21.099
Edible enough, Jesus.

03:21.134 --> 03:23.277
Marriage contract--
that's a thing?

03:23.312 --> 03:24.872
Yeah.

03:24.907 --> 03:27.105
Her shrink says I promised
Maggie I'd make big money.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.613
Fuck me if I'm running
behind schedule.

03:29.648 --> 03:31.142
But she bitches I'm
pinching pennies.

03:31.177 --> 03:33.551
I'm pinching fucking pennies.

03:33.586 --> 03:37.115
Try not buying $600 rings,
and let me get back on track.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.215
Yeah, simple math.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.459
Yes, simple math, right?

03:40.494 --> 03:42.428
But no, here I am,
serving up fucking

03:42.463 --> 03:45.794
expired food to make more money
to pay her shrink to tell her

03:45.829 --> 03:48.401
I'm pinching fucking pennies.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.095
Where's my shit?

03:50.130 --> 03:51.965
We're having a conversation.

03:52.000 --> 03:52.900
Yeah, you told me.

03:52.935 --> 03:54.033
Now, where's my shit?

04:04.309 --> 04:05.682
Don't tell me you lost it.

04:05.717 --> 04:07.079
That's some sensitive shit.

04:07.114 --> 04:07.684
Fuck me.

04:23.570 --> 04:24.162
Hey, Mags?

04:28.036 --> 04:28.639
Maggie?

04:40.752 --> 04:41.355
Mags!

04:46.923 --> 04:47.988
Hey, Mags.

04:48.023 --> 04:49.561
You OK?

04:49.596 --> 04:53.664
What kind of monster are you?

04:53.699 --> 04:57.162
Whatever that
is, it is not mine.

04:57.197 --> 04:57.899
You're lying.

04:57.934 --> 04:58.636
I'm not.
I'm not.

04:58.671 --> 04:59.802
I'm not.

04:59.837 --> 05:00.506
It's this work
guy, Tommy, Jesus.

05:00.541 --> 05:01.507
I swear to God.

05:01.542 --> 05:02.673
Don't you dare swear to God.

05:02.708 --> 05:05.170
You're not entitled
to swear to God.

05:05.205 --> 05:07.381
Jesus, what the
fuck is in there?

05:07.416 --> 05:13.343
Pictures of children,
of little children.

05:13.378 --> 05:15.048
Holy shit.

05:15.083 --> 05:18.018
I had nothing to do with that,
Maggie, and I mean nothing.

05:18.053 --> 05:19.723
I was just passing them along.

05:19.758 --> 05:24.321
MAGGIE: You brought this filth
into our home, into my home.

05:24.356 --> 05:25.894
Why do you have anything
to do with this freak?

05:25.929 --> 05:27.357
JAY: OK, he's a piece
of shit, all right?

05:27.392 --> 05:28.325
You think I don't know that?

05:28.360 --> 05:29.535
But those are not mine.

05:29.570 --> 05:31.702
You're providing them.

05:31.737 --> 05:35.068
This is a crime, and
you are an accessory!

05:35.103 --> 05:37.367
And that's if I
even believe you!

05:37.402 --> 05:39.611
What the fuck does that mean?

05:39.646 --> 05:41.415
You think I get
off on that shit?

05:41.450 --> 05:43.373
I don't know what
you get off on, Jay.

05:43.408 --> 05:44.946
JAY: It's just part of the deal.

05:44.981 --> 05:48.081
I pass along the packages,
and I get cheap food.

05:48.116 --> 05:49.588
If you can't figure
out how to make a buck,

05:49.623 --> 05:52.349
that's fine, but this?

05:52.384 --> 05:53.889
You need to leave!

05:53.924 --> 05:55.055
JAY: Oh, I need to leave?

05:55.090 --> 05:56.353
Yeah!

05:56.388 --> 05:57.563
This is my house,
Maggie, and I'm not

05:57.598 --> 05:59.257
leaving my own fucking house!

05:59.292 --> 06:00.599
I'm calling the cops.

06:00.634 --> 06:02.700
Hey, hey, do not--
do not call the cops!

06:02.735 --> 06:06.198
Get out, I said.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.640
[music playing]

06:10.435 --> 06:11.104
JAY: Fuck you, Mags!

06:25.857 --> 06:28.429
[tires screeching]

06:31.797 --> 06:33.797
Hey, are you crazy with this?

06:33.832 --> 06:34.963
Are you fucking insane?

06:34.998 --> 06:36.602
Maggie found those
pictures, man.

06:36.637 --> 06:37.570
Oh, we had an agreement, man.

06:37.605 --> 06:38.736
My business is my business.

06:38.771 --> 06:39.935
Nobody told you to open it.

06:39.970 --> 06:40.969
Yeah, well, I didn't open it.

06:41.004 --> 06:41.805
Maggie opened it.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.136
She threw me out.

06:43.171 --> 06:44.643
Oh, maybe she's using
that as an excuse.

06:44.678 --> 06:46.073
Maybe she's like
banging someone else.

06:46.108 --> 06:46.744
[grunting]
- What?

06:46.779 --> 06:48.009
No, she's not.

06:48.044 --> 06:49.483
Jesus.

06:49.518 --> 06:50.341
You're the one who should
be seeing a shrink,

06:50.376 --> 06:51.441
you fucking perv.

06:51.476 --> 06:52.409
What the hell is wrong with you?

06:52.444 --> 06:54.411
Hey, man, we had a deal.

06:54.446 --> 06:55.247
I do for you.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.248
Then you do for me.

06:56.283 --> 06:57.447
Now you take another side?

06:57.482 --> 06:59.119
That's fucking
Stockholm syndrome.

06:59.154 --> 07:00.824
OK, that is not Stockholm
syndrome, you fucking maniac.

07:00.859 --> 07:02.023
That's Stockholm syndrome.

07:02.058 --> 07:03.794
No, that is not
Stockholm syndrome.

07:03.829 --> 07:05.763
Stockholm syndrome is when you
get kidnapped and brainwashed.

07:05.798 --> 07:08.458
God damn it, are
you fucking thick?

07:08.493 --> 07:10.768
Oh, she's going to clean me out.

07:10.803 --> 07:11.428
So fucking what?

07:11.463 --> 07:12.363
Stay here, man.

07:12.398 --> 07:13.870
You got a can.

07:13.905 --> 07:16.708
You got a full kitchen,
hella meat, cheese, and--

07:16.743 --> 07:19.271
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's
my dream fucking scenario.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.548
Fuck, what if she goes to
the cops with those pictures?

07:21.583 --> 07:23.946
Then I'm an accessory
to your sick shit-- ah!

07:23.981 --> 07:24.518
Fuck!

07:24.553 --> 07:26.850
Ow!

07:26.885 --> 07:28.885
I got fucking plans, man!

07:28.920 --> 07:31.888
So it's best to keep me
out of the situation!

07:31.923 --> 07:34.055
So if you need help getting
those pictures back,

07:34.090 --> 07:37.322
which you better fucking
do, I know a guy.

07:39.898 --> 07:40.831
Ah!

07:40.866 --> 07:42.294
You understand?

07:42.329 --> 07:43.229
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:43.264 --> 07:43.966
I'll handle it.

07:44.001 --> 07:45.803
I'll handle it.

07:45.838 --> 07:48.168
Ah, oh.

07:48.203 --> 07:49.367
I want my fucking pictures!

07:53.241 --> 07:56.143
His life had taken
an unexpected turn.

07:56.178 --> 07:59.212
Every night, he ate a can
of soup in front of the TV,

07:59.247 --> 08:03.315
usually Jeopardy unless
a ballgame was on.

08:03.350 --> 08:06.890
His friends would call, but
he didn't want to see them.

08:06.925 --> 08:09.354
He didn't want their
well meaning pity.

08:09.389 --> 08:12.423
But it wasn't just that.

08:12.458 --> 08:15.932
For years, he had
the perfect life.

08:15.967 --> 08:18.572
It was too hard for him
to admit it was over.

08:26.978 --> 08:29.110
So was that autobiographical?

08:29.145 --> 08:32.047
Oh, no, just madeup stuff.

08:32.082 --> 08:33.884
I thought it
was really moving.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.447
How long you been writing?

08:36.482 --> 08:38.086
I wouldn't really
call it writing,

08:38.121 --> 08:39.692
but I've been playing around
with it since high school.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.694
This high school, in fact.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.289
Huh.

08:43.324 --> 08:44.763
Here.

08:44.798 --> 08:46.523
Defacing public property.

08:46.558 --> 08:47.392
Wow.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.394
So you were a hooligan.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.561
Well, I have since reformed.

08:51.596 --> 08:54.102
Glad to hear it.

08:54.137 --> 08:59.811
Hey, I was going to grab
a coffee down the street

08:59.846 --> 09:01.241
if you want to join me maybe.

09:01.276 --> 09:03.045
Oh, uh--

09:03.080 --> 09:04.816
Come on.

09:04.851 --> 09:07.346
You'll be miserable for 20
minutes tops, I promise.

09:15.587 --> 09:18.555
You know, sometimes,
in conversation,

09:18.590 --> 09:21.096
the other person might
ask, for instance,

09:21.131 --> 09:24.594
how long they've been writing,
you know, just as an example.

09:24.629 --> 09:26.563
Coincidentally,
I was just going

09:26.598 --> 09:30.468
to ask, even before
you mentioned that,

09:30.503 --> 09:32.239
how long have you been writing?

09:32.274 --> 09:35.847
Well, I got my first
diary on my 10th birthday

09:35.882 --> 09:39.950
and then tore through one
a month till I was 23.

09:39.985 --> 09:41.655
What happened to 23?

09:41.690 --> 09:45.417
Mm, got married, had a child
two months later-- my parents

09:45.452 --> 09:47.023
not happy about that.

09:47.058 --> 09:51.060
And 12 years flew
by, and here I am.

09:57.002 --> 10:00.971
Uh, so you're
married with a kid?

10:01.006 --> 10:05.943
Mm, I'm separated
with two kids.

10:05.978 --> 10:08.275
So what about you?

10:08.310 --> 10:12.180
What's your situation?

10:12.215 --> 10:13.346
No kids.

10:13.381 --> 10:14.050
No kids.

10:14.085 --> 10:16.822
My wife passed.

10:16.857 --> 10:20.056
Wow, I'm sorry.

10:20.091 --> 10:22.729
You know, life.

10:22.764 --> 10:24.797
It's what happens
while you're busy making

10:24.832 --> 10:29.901
other plans, which is not a
John Lennon quote, by the way.

10:29.936 --> 10:31.298
No, it is actually from a--

10:31.333 --> 10:33.740
[voice fading out]

10:33.775 --> 10:37.238
[leaf blower]

10:45.754 --> 10:46.511
Hey.

10:46.546 --> 10:47.644
Hey, Mags.

10:47.679 --> 10:49.217
I told you to stay away.

10:49.252 --> 10:50.922
I'm just getting it nice
and neat the way you like it.

10:50.957 --> 10:51.549
Come on.

10:51.584 --> 10:52.253
Come on.

10:52.288 --> 10:53.419
We got to talk.

10:53.454 --> 10:54.519
You're not answering the phone.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.553
Because I don't want to talk.

10:55.588 --> 10:56.829
You see how that works?

10:56.864 --> 10:58.655
And don't you dare
come by the diner.

10:58.690 --> 11:00.767
Hey, Mags, listen to me.

11:00.802 --> 11:02.769
Hey, listen.

11:02.804 --> 11:05.563
I know you're pissed, but
do not go to the cops.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.005
This guy, Tommy T,
he's a complete psycho.

11:08.040 --> 11:11.173
You go to the cops, I don't
know what he's going to do.

11:11.208 --> 11:12.240
To you or to me?

11:12.275 --> 11:14.572
You, me, both of us.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.673
But I'm worried about you.

11:16.708 --> 11:20.248
[scoffs] Fuck you, Jay!

11:20.283 --> 11:21.546
My lawyer's calling you.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.680
Waste your bullshit on her.

11:23.715 --> 11:26.287
You're calling a lawyer?

11:26.322 --> 11:27.761
Mags, come on.

11:27.796 --> 11:29.290
Mags!

11:29.325 --> 11:31.930
Seriously?

11:31.965 --> 11:35.527
What, did your shrink
tell you to do that?

[gong]

[asian music]

11:46.980 --> 11:49.277
You know, if you don't
mind, actually, I'm

11:49.312 --> 11:51.477
a little sore today, the
neck and shoulders area.

11:51.512 --> 11:52.643
Oh.

11:52.678 --> 11:54.282
First time for
everything, right?

11:54.317 --> 11:58.188
[chuckles] Yeah, I
got a lot of stress.

12:01.258 --> 12:04.754
Yeah, got a lot of decisions
to make that's going to affect

12:04.789 --> 12:09.000
my lifestyle, my
disposable income.

12:09.035 --> 12:11.904
You know Castle Subs,
Indian school in Highland?

12:11.939 --> 12:14.005
That was a sub place?

12:14.040 --> 12:18.570
Yeah, it's a sub
place, Castle Subs?

12:18.605 --> 12:21.177
I'm a franchisee.

12:21.212 --> 12:24.246
Just the one place for
now, but down the road,

12:24.281 --> 12:27.777
I imagine six, maybe
seven establishments.

12:27.812 --> 12:30.582
And then from there, you
know, sky's the limit.

12:30.617 --> 12:33.321
You know Howard Schultz?

12:33.356 --> 12:36.962
Starbucks guy, who
owns half the planet?

12:36.997 --> 12:39.360
I'm going to own the other half.

12:39.395 --> 12:40.592
Big dreams.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.297
What's stopping you?

12:42.332 --> 12:47.467
Nothing's stopping me, except
the potential legal impediment

12:47.502 --> 12:50.140
from my wife, of all people.

12:50.175 --> 12:52.670
Can you believe that?

12:52.705 --> 12:54.540
What would Starbucks guy do?

12:54.575 --> 12:57.543
[music playing]

13:05.520 --> 13:08.389
Hey, Tommy T. Set it up.

13:23.736 --> 13:26.704
[tv playing distantly]

13:50.400 --> 13:53.368
[knocking]

13:53.403 --> 13:56.569
Mr. Cosco!

13:56.604 --> 13:59.572
[planes flying on tv]

14:25.798 --> 14:27.303
Pretty loud, don't you think?

14:33.245 --> 14:34.244
[tv stops]

14:39.988 --> 14:42.483
Tommy T fill you in?

14:42.518 --> 14:44.287
My situation, he explain it?

14:48.161 --> 14:50.524
What, you got
laryngitis or something?

14:53.199 --> 14:56.068
Oh, you're deaf?

14:56.103 --> 14:56.893
Seriously?

14:56.928 --> 14:57.597
You're fucking deaf?

15:02.472 --> 15:05.770
So-- so you read lips?

15:08.544 --> 15:12.018
Oh, Jesus, OK.

15:12.053 --> 15:13.349
[shredding]

15:13.384 --> 15:16.484
Yeah, smart.

15:16.519 --> 15:17.518
No paper trail.

15:17.553 --> 15:18.354
I like that.

15:22.393 --> 15:31.367
OK, so, uh, my wife,
she is threatening

15:31.402 --> 15:34.634
to go to the cops over
some shit that Tommy T got

15:34.669 --> 15:36.867
involved with-- no judgment.

15:36.902 --> 15:42.279
So basically what I would
like from you is to scare her

15:42.314 --> 15:48.351
off the idea, which, you know,
ultimately is for the best

15:48.386 --> 15:52.190
because you know Tommy
T is no fucking angel.

15:56.988 --> 16:00.066
So that's why you didn't know
the TV was so fucking loud.

16:03.566 --> 16:05.896
As soon as possible.

16:05.931 --> 16:09.372
Yeah, you're really
doing me a solid, man.

16:09.407 --> 16:10.967
So tell you what?

16:11.002 --> 16:13.244
Free food at my
sub shop for life.

16:15.776 --> 16:16.742
It's a perk.

16:16.777 --> 16:18.216
You know, not like your fee.

16:24.950 --> 16:27.885
[shredding]

16:32.364 --> 16:35.728
And let me get a mega bowl.

16:35.763 --> 16:38.566
Ugh, can you even
imagine this much money?

16:38.601 --> 16:40.073
I wouldn't even
know where to start.

16:40.108 --> 16:41.569
Pretty sure the
taxes on the lump sum

16:41.604 --> 16:44.341
are like half, though, right?

16:44.376 --> 16:45.705
Yeah, I don't know.

16:45.740 --> 16:47.674
Yeah, pretty sure they are.

16:47.709 --> 16:51.249
I mean, I could live OK on
$100 million, though, right?

16:51.284 --> 16:52.041
What was the number?

16:52.076 --> 16:53.944
I just want to pay.

16:53.979 --> 16:55.880
No, you don't want to
miss out on these rewards.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.948
What's your phone?

16:57.983 --> 17:04.460
928-965-2541.

17:04.495 --> 17:06.231
Maggie Moore.

17:06.266 --> 17:07.793
JAY: My wife.

17:07.828 --> 17:09.531
Got it.

17:09.566 --> 17:11.368
Would you like to add your
name to the loyalty membership?

17:11.403 --> 17:12.600
Nope.

17:12.635 --> 17:13.766
OK, then we'll keep
it just your wife

17:13.801 --> 17:15.735
then on Hanover Court.

17:15.770 --> 17:18.111
Chip reader's not working
so you can just slide.

17:18.146 --> 17:22.071
Wait, we don't live
on Hanover Court.

17:22.106 --> 17:24.612
Yep, 32 Hanover Court.

17:24.647 --> 17:26.317
Nope, we live on Donna Circle.

17:26.352 --> 17:26.878
You know what?

17:26.913 --> 17:27.747
Forget it.

17:27.782 --> 17:28.484
Just forget the loyalty.

17:28.519 --> 17:29.122
Wait.

17:29.157 --> 17:30.255
Oh.

17:30.290 --> 17:31.949
Oh, I see.

17:31.984 --> 17:34.127
There's two Maggie Moores in
the system, the one at Hanover

17:34.162 --> 17:35.656
and then you guys on Donna.

17:35.691 --> 17:38.395
And then somehow the system
just like-- oh, wait.

17:38.430 --> 17:40.793
No, it didn't switch it.

17:40.828 --> 17:42.267
It's just under that one phone.

17:42.302 --> 17:44.137
That is so weird.

17:44.172 --> 17:45.028
I wonder how that happened.

17:48.704 --> 17:50.902
You never finished
telling me about your date,

17:50.937 --> 17:52.178
the co-ed from class.

17:55.645 --> 17:57.249
OK, first of all,
it wasn't a date.

17:57.284 --> 18:00.417
And second of all, she's a
grown woman with two kids.

18:00.452 --> 18:02.155
OK, what's wrong with that?

18:02.190 --> 18:03.651
I didn't say anything
was wrong with her.

18:06.656 --> 18:08.084
OK, this is going
to sound weird--

18:08.119 --> 18:10.196
I mean really sound weird.

18:10.231 --> 18:11.527
Lay it on me.

18:11.562 --> 18:12.957
Lay it on me?

18:12.992 --> 18:14.464
What are you?

18:14.499 --> 18:15.663
You're in the
States for 10 years,

18:15.698 --> 18:17.126
and that's what you pick up?

18:17.161 --> 18:19.535
You're deflecting.

18:19.570 --> 18:21.834
OK.

18:21.869 --> 18:24.342
Oh, god, we went
and had cheesecake

18:24.377 --> 18:25.607
at this place near class.

18:25.642 --> 18:28.104
She paid, and you
felt like a wuss.

18:28.139 --> 18:30.315
You're right, that's
really stupid.

18:30.350 --> 18:32.108
No, that is not what happened.

18:32.143 --> 18:36.112
She had cheesecake on her chin,
a little crumb of cheesecake.

18:36.147 --> 18:38.191
She had a little crumb
of cheesecake on her chin,

18:38.226 --> 18:39.852
and you found that unforgivable.

18:39.887 --> 18:41.392
Yeah, it just sat
there the whole time.

18:41.427 --> 18:43.955
Why didn't you
just lick it off?

18:43.990 --> 18:44.989
Too forward?

18:45.024 --> 18:47.464
Like a napkin?

18:47.499 --> 18:48.861
A gentle wipe?

18:48.896 --> 18:51.028
Look, you asked me how
it went, and I told you.

18:51.063 --> 18:51.798
OK?

18:51.833 --> 18:53.734
Done, there, fine.

18:53.769 --> 18:55.505
OK.

18:55.540 --> 18:56.836
But you understand this alleged
crumb as a reason to shut down

18:56.871 --> 19:00.378
a relationship is not rational.

19:00.413 --> 19:03.249
It's not.

19:03.284 --> 19:05.350
And when I say that it's
not rational, what I mean

19:05.385 --> 19:06.945
is there's something
terribly wrong with you.

19:12.458 --> 19:13.523
Morning.

19:13.558 --> 19:15.822
Hey, Rita.

19:15.857 --> 19:17.054
I haven't seen Jay around.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.396
I'm really late for work.

19:18.431 --> 19:19.331
Oh, sure.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.762
But we're not--

19:21.797 --> 19:24.270
Jay and I aren't going
to be together anymore.

19:24.305 --> 19:25.601
Oh, my goodness.

19:25.636 --> 19:29.242
Yeah, I mean, please
don't say anything.

19:29.277 --> 19:30.375
It's not for publication.

19:30.410 --> 19:31.904
No, no, of course.

19:31.939 --> 19:33.279
It's just like they
become completely

19:33.314 --> 19:35.204
different people, you know?

19:35.239 --> 19:35.776
I do.

19:35.811 --> 19:37.206
I do know.

19:37.241 --> 19:38.449
Save a lot of trouble
if they just told you

19:38.484 --> 19:40.682
their weirdo crap at the start.

19:40.717 --> 19:44.554
Anyway, I got to scoot.

19:44.589 --> 19:46.083
Hey, knock when you get back.

19:46.118 --> 19:49.020
We can open a wine
and have girl talk.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.791
Sorry, what?

19:50.826 --> 19:52.122
Have a great day.

19:52.157 --> 19:54.531
Take care.

19:54.566 --> 19:57.567
[music playing]

[dramatic music]

20:13.948 --> 20:14.947
[gasps] Oh!

20:17.919 --> 20:19.886
Oh, please.

20:19.921 --> 20:21.723
Please don't hurt me.

20:21.758 --> 20:22.361
Please.

20:26.796 --> 20:28.730
Please don't hurt me.

20:28.765 --> 20:29.698
Please don't.

20:37.609 --> 20:40.511
[phone ringing]

20:45.485 --> 20:46.682
Castle.

20:46.717 --> 20:47.683
JERRY CONNORS (ON
PHONE): Mr. Moore,

20:47.718 --> 20:49.245
Jerry Connors of corporate.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.456
You focused on the
operation over there?

20:51.491 --> 20:52.457
What?

20:52.492 --> 20:53.854
Uh, yeah, of course, we are.

20:53.889 --> 20:55.625
JERRY CONNORS (ON
PHONE): Because according

20:55.660 --> 20:58.661
to our records, it's been, it
looks like, over three months

20:58.696 --> 21:00.531
since you purchased
any inventory--

21:00.566 --> 21:03.963
meats, cheese, chips, produce,
the fresh cookie dough.

21:03.998 --> 21:05.932
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you know, I must

21:05.967 --> 21:08.605
have overbought at some
point because we got plenty.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.343
We are fully stocked.

21:10.378 --> 21:12.169
JERRY CONNORS (ON PHONE): Are
you saying you're still using

21:12.204 --> 21:13.808
product from three months ago?

21:13.843 --> 21:15.546
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

21:15.581 --> 21:17.878
You must be missing a couple
orders because our stuff

21:17.913 --> 21:19.143
is beautiful, fresh as can be.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.782
JERRY CONNORS (ON
PHONE): Mr. Moore,

21:20.817 --> 21:23.620
are you checking the expiration
dates on the packaging?

21:23.655 --> 21:25.457
Yeah, absolutely, every day.

21:25.492 --> 21:29.054
You know, Mr. Connors, we have
got customers out the door,

21:29.089 --> 21:31.320
but we will be
reordering very soon.

21:31.355 --> 21:32.794
I can promise you that.

21:32.829 --> 21:35.533
Hey, this one is
pretty gross, too.

21:35.568 --> 21:38.635
OK, Greg, well,
toss it and move on.

21:38.670 --> 21:41.066
Can you figure that out?

21:41.101 --> 21:44.069
[music playing]

22:01.055 --> 22:01.856
Hey, Shel.

22:01.891 --> 22:03.220
Mags in the kitchen?

22:03.255 --> 22:04.661
Heard you had quite
the knockdown dragout.

22:04.696 --> 22:06.058
It's a misunderstanding.

22:06.093 --> 22:06.927
Is she in the kitchen?

22:06.962 --> 22:08.434
54 is your change.

22:08.469 --> 22:09.567
Thank you.

22:09.602 --> 22:10.568
She didn't come
in, and she didn't

22:10.603 --> 22:12.702
call, which is not like her.

22:12.737 --> 22:16.101
Yeah, she's not answering
her cell phone either.

22:16.136 --> 22:17.003
You worried?

22:17.038 --> 22:18.268
Yeah, getting to be.

22:18.303 --> 22:19.709
If she checks in,
can you ever give me

22:19.744 --> 22:21.271
a call or text me or something?

22:21.306 --> 22:24.175
OK.

22:24.210 --> 22:25.781
Hi, how's everything?

22:25.816 --> 22:27.552
DISPATCH (ON RADIO):
Hey, I got a couple

22:27.587 --> 22:30.621
of calls about the fire up the
B Line and Sycamore trailhead.

22:30.656 --> 22:33.217
It's probably just some
idiot burning leaves.

22:33.252 --> 22:34.317
Give it a look, will you?

23:13.292 --> 23:14.291
Well, that's not good.

23:20.299 --> 23:21.639
I don't know.

23:21.674 --> 23:23.267
Gas leak or
something electrical.

23:23.302 --> 23:27.810
You'd think there'd be
time to go out of the car.

23:27.845 --> 23:30.549
Unless, you know,
spontaneous combustion.

23:33.378 --> 23:34.520
So let me get this straight.

23:34.555 --> 23:36.753
In your scenario
here, this person

23:36.788 --> 23:39.690
drives off the highway down
some random embankment,

23:39.725 --> 23:42.924
stops here, and spontaneously
bursts into flames?

23:42.959 --> 23:44.189
Can't even tell you the sex.

23:44.224 --> 23:45.696
Too badly burned.

23:45.731 --> 23:47.533
An accelerant was used,
though, and plenty of it.

23:47.568 --> 23:51.537
Ah, so not
spontaneous combustion.

23:51.572 --> 23:53.429
I'll get you
more from the lab.

23:53.464 --> 23:54.034
Thank you.

23:58.843 --> 24:02.174
You know, KB, that was
a person who died there,

24:02.209 --> 24:05.848
murdered in a horrible,
horrible fashion.

24:05.883 --> 24:06.882
I know.

24:06.917 --> 24:08.653
Why do you got to make jokes?

24:08.688 --> 24:09.478
It's not right.

24:09.513 --> 24:10.215
It's not respectful.

24:10.250 --> 24:12.019
Don't do it, OK?

24:12.054 --> 24:13.218
Yeah.

24:13.253 --> 24:14.989
Did you pull a
VIN off the car?

24:15.024 --> 24:16.958
No, dash and doors too melted.

24:16.993 --> 24:18.454
Did you check the battery?

24:18.489 --> 24:20.764
Sometimes there's a
serial number plate.

24:25.166 --> 24:26.198
Yeah, see?

24:26.233 --> 24:26.902
There.

24:26.937 --> 24:27.496
Yeah.

24:27.531 --> 24:29.135
Run that.

24:29.170 --> 24:31.907
Also, call around all
the taxicab companies--

24:31.942 --> 24:35.042
Uber, Lyft, places like that.

24:35.077 --> 24:37.308
See if they had any
pickups around here

24:37.343 --> 24:39.343
'cause I don't see our guy
hitchhiking out of here.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.128
[knocking]

25:02.643 --> 25:04.269
Mr. Moore?

25:04.304 --> 25:05.435
Can I help you?

25:05.470 --> 25:08.438
Oh, uh, yeah.

25:08.473 --> 25:11.375
I'm looking for Jay Moore.

25:11.410 --> 25:12.684
I don't think he's here.

25:12.719 --> 25:13.850
I mean, he's not here.

25:13.885 --> 25:15.412
They're separated.

25:15.447 --> 25:17.051
Oh.

25:17.086 --> 25:19.284
Big fight.

25:19.319 --> 25:20.758
Yeah?

25:20.793 --> 25:21.418
Huge.

25:25.325 --> 25:28.095
You know, this is
really not necessary.

25:28.130 --> 25:29.932
Well, you don't
want to watch me eat.

25:32.673 --> 25:33.529
OK.

25:33.564 --> 25:36.037
Well, thank you.

25:36.072 --> 25:37.368
So what can you tell
me about this fight?

25:37.403 --> 25:38.710
Were you over there?

25:38.745 --> 25:40.646
Uh, no, no, no, here.

25:40.681 --> 25:42.373
I don't know.

25:42.408 --> 25:45.750
I guess sound must carry at
night, but they were just--

25:45.785 --> 25:47.213
man, they were
really going at it.

25:47.248 --> 25:48.819
Do they fight a lot?

25:48.854 --> 25:50.821
More so lately.

25:50.856 --> 25:53.725
Oh, did Maggie file
a restraining order?

25:53.760 --> 25:55.320
Is that why you're here?

25:55.355 --> 25:57.729
Can't say.

25:57.764 --> 26:01.293
But maybe did you hear
anything specific about what

26:01.328 --> 26:02.635
they were fighting about?

26:02.670 --> 26:06.298
I mean, it was
pretty garbled, but she

26:06.333 --> 26:08.069
did yell the word "filth."

26:08.104 --> 26:10.401
I caught that.

26:10.436 --> 26:11.644
Filth.

26:11.679 --> 26:13.910
And then he was banished.

26:13.945 --> 26:16.110
He did come back one
day to work on the lawn,

26:16.145 --> 26:17.683
and that did not go over well.

26:17.718 --> 26:19.476
[coughing]

26:19.511 --> 26:20.444
Oh, no.

26:20.479 --> 26:21.313
Was there too much pepper?

26:21.348 --> 26:22.017
Wow.

26:22.052 --> 26:22.952
You want milk?

26:22.987 --> 26:23.986
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

26:24.021 --> 26:24.954
Please, please, please sit.

26:24.989 --> 26:25.988
I'm fine.

26:26.023 --> 26:27.957
It just caught me by surprise.

26:27.992 --> 26:30.828
I have this sick
thing for pepper.

26:30.863 --> 26:32.291
Mm.

26:32.326 --> 26:32.995
No, I get it.

26:33.030 --> 26:34.326
I get it.

26:34.361 --> 26:36.966
My wife, we have one
spice in our home.

26:37.001 --> 26:38.627
It's garlic salt. She
puts it on everything--

26:38.662 --> 26:41.674
steak, hamburger, cereal.

26:41.709 --> 26:42.708
I'm kidding, of course.

26:42.743 --> 26:43.709
She would never put it on steak.

26:43.744 --> 26:46.712
[laughs] OK.

26:46.747 --> 26:50.507
Well, you know, you're welcome
to take the shaker home

26:50.542 --> 26:52.113
and show her what
she's been missing.

26:52.148 --> 26:55.347
Uh, yeah.

26:55.382 --> 26:58.922
She passed away
about a year ago.

27:01.828 --> 27:03.487
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

27:07.592 --> 27:09.735
I'm divorced if you
were wondering why I drag

27:09.770 --> 27:12.199
strangers in to eat with me.

27:12.234 --> 27:14.498
[laughs] Well, you
must have friends.

27:14.533 --> 27:16.071
Oh, god, no.

27:16.106 --> 27:19.206
They all chose him, and frankly,
I can't make the effort.

27:19.241 --> 27:20.977
I've been trying to
pal up to Maggie.

27:21.012 --> 27:22.539
We'll see where that goes.

27:22.574 --> 27:23.507
She seems nice.

27:23.542 --> 27:25.850
Her husband's a little off.

27:25.885 --> 27:29.546
I'm finding it takes courage
to be happy, you know?

27:29.581 --> 27:31.449
I'm just not sure my
ex left me with any.

27:36.456 --> 27:37.092
I don't know.

27:37.127 --> 27:39.160
I bet you--

27:39.195 --> 27:41.228
I bet you have plenty.

27:41.263 --> 27:43.230
No, he broke me
down pretty good.

27:43.265 --> 27:48.741
[laughs]

27:48.776 --> 27:52.272
Well, where do
you think I might

27:52.307 --> 27:54.604
be able to find Jay Moore?

27:54.639 --> 27:55.847
Come on, man.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.013
It's my prom.

27:57.048 --> 27:59.213
Yeah, and prom's
a huge night for us.

27:59.248 --> 28:01.545
Yeah, but like who eats subs?

28:01.580 --> 28:04.581
Anyway, like, we're all dressed
up to go to real restaurants.

28:04.616 --> 28:05.791
Yeah, and you smoke weed.

28:05.826 --> 28:08.387
You get wasted and unpacked.

28:08.422 --> 28:09.190
Sorry, Greg.

28:09.225 --> 28:10.961
I can't spare you.

28:10.996 --> 28:12.424
[knocking]

28:24.273 --> 28:24.876
Hey there, officer.

28:24.911 --> 28:25.536
Mr. Moore.

28:25.571 --> 28:26.735
Yeah, yeah.

28:26.770 --> 28:27.472
Mind if I talk to
you for a second?

28:27.507 --> 28:27.978
Yeah, of course.

28:31.115 --> 28:31.949
No, no.

28:31.984 --> 28:33.445
No, that can't be right.

28:33.480 --> 28:36.118
It's possible there's
a mistake, no?

28:36.153 --> 28:37.713
When was the last
time you saw your wife?

28:37.748 --> 28:41.552
I was just over
to work on the yard.

28:41.587 --> 28:44.489
So you two were
living separately then?

28:44.524 --> 28:48.328
We had like a stupid
fight, and I tried

28:48.363 --> 28:49.835
calling her today to apologize.

28:49.870 --> 28:52.596
I even went to the diner
where she works, you know,

28:52.631 --> 28:56.765
trying to make up.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.767
Who would do this?

28:58.802 --> 29:02.078
Everybody just loved Mags.

29:02.113 --> 29:03.508
She was a rock star.

29:08.053 --> 29:10.779
We'll find out
sooner or later.

29:10.814 --> 29:11.516
We always do.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.356
I'm very sorry for
your loss, Mr. Moore.

29:24.135 --> 29:25.266
I'm sorry for your loss.

29:25.301 --> 29:29.006
[door banging open]

29:29.041 --> 29:30.007
TOMMY T (ON PHONE): What's up?

29:30.042 --> 29:31.371
He fucking killed her.

29:31.406 --> 29:32.273
Who's this?

29:32.308 --> 29:33.307
Jay?

29:33.342 --> 29:34.946
Chief of police was just here.

29:34.981 --> 29:36.046
Jesus fucking Christ.

29:36.081 --> 29:37.278
They're going to
nail me for this.

29:37.313 --> 29:38.807
You understand?

29:38.842 --> 29:40.644
That's what's up, dude,
but you know, there's still

29:40.679 --> 29:42.811
the matter of my finder's fee.

29:42.846 --> 29:44.285
What?

29:44.320 --> 29:45.682
What did you just say?

29:45.717 --> 29:47.519
I mean, look, I
get things went awry.

29:47.554 --> 29:48.289
But--

29:48.324 --> 29:49.862
Things went awry?

29:49.897 --> 29:53.965
He burned Maggie up
in her fucking car!

29:54.000 --> 29:58.167
Yeah, I hear you, dude,
but business is business.

29:58.202 --> 29:59.498
Fuck you!

29:59.533 --> 30:00.631
Fuck you!

30:00.666 --> 30:01.467
[banging]

30:01.502 --> 30:02.039
Fuck you!

30:02.074 --> 30:02.908
Fuck you!

30:02.943 --> 30:03.535
Fuck!

30:12.711 --> 30:13.611
Piece of shit phone.

30:22.259 --> 30:24.589
So you're telling me that
even if the potato chips or what

30:24.624 --> 30:26.558
have you are cheaper
somewhere else, that they have

30:26.593 --> 30:28.934
to buy Castle Subs products?

30:28.969 --> 30:30.595
JERRY CONNORS (ON PHONE):
That's right, officer.

30:30.630 --> 30:31.827
OK, got it.

30:31.862 --> 30:33.400
Thank you for your
time, Mr. Connors.

30:33.435 --> 30:34.731
JERRY CONNORS (ON
PHONE): My pleasure.

30:37.076 --> 30:39.538
Well, Jay Moore
is into something.

30:39.573 --> 30:42.079
Because he's selling
shitty no name chips?

30:42.114 --> 30:44.609
It's a breach of the
franchise agreement.

30:44.644 --> 30:47.117
He has to buy
Castle Subs product.

30:47.152 --> 30:49.581
If he buys from Liberty
Bell foods or wherever else,

30:49.616 --> 30:51.583
he stiffs corporate
out of their money.

30:51.618 --> 30:53.882
Either way, what's that got
to do with his murdered wife?

30:53.917 --> 30:55.389
I do not know.

30:55.424 --> 30:57.061
Because you seem really
worked up over this.

30:57.096 --> 30:59.888
Well, we have a victim who
was unable to yield any clues

30:59.923 --> 31:01.395
due to her--

31:01.430 --> 31:03.463
Crispiness.

31:03.498 --> 31:04.134
Christ's sakes.

31:04.169 --> 31:05.762
KB, will you--

31:05.797 --> 31:08.270
Sorry, it just happens.

31:08.305 --> 31:10.041
Don't do it anymore.

31:10.076 --> 31:12.571
What do you got?

31:12.606 --> 31:14.738
Called all the
transport companies.

31:14.773 --> 31:16.311
No one had a pickup
near the B Line.

31:16.346 --> 31:19.644
Also Jay's story checks
out at the diner.

31:19.679 --> 31:22.086
Also there's a record of
his call to Maggie's cell,

31:22.121 --> 31:24.055
just like he told you.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.122
So we've got nothing.

31:27.918 --> 31:29.995
Hey, two Maggie Moores guy.

31:30.030 --> 31:31.997
[bell]

31:33.429 --> 31:34.758
Uh, what?

31:34.793 --> 31:36.430
Two Maggie Moores
in the system, one

31:36.465 --> 31:38.465
at 32 Hanover,
you guys on Donna.

31:38.500 --> 31:39.268
Remember?

31:39.303 --> 31:40.467
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:40.502 --> 31:42.766
Dude, what a
crazy coincidence.

31:42.801 --> 31:45.307
[scoffs] What are
the odds of that?

31:49.115 --> 31:51.511
Mr. Moore.

31:51.546 --> 31:53.678
Mr. Moore.

31:53.713 --> 31:54.646
Mr. Moore.

31:54.681 --> 31:56.351
[bell]

31:56.386 --> 31:58.089
Yeah.

31:58.124 --> 32:01.323
Yeah, let me get a mega bowl
and a couple of those phones.

32:10.631 --> 32:14.204
No, it was weird for me to see
my name in a story like that.

32:14.239 --> 32:16.206
Mags, you seen my glasses?

32:16.241 --> 32:18.538
In here!

32:18.573 --> 32:20.045
Well, tell Daddy that I'm fine.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.806
It was just one of those
spooky coincidences, OK?

32:22.841 --> 32:24.478
So I'll see you on Tuesday, Mom.

32:24.513 --> 32:26.447
OK, I love you, too.

32:26.482 --> 32:28.152
OK, bye.

32:28.187 --> 32:30.022
Your folks OK?

32:30.057 --> 32:32.057
Yeah, I talked them down.

32:32.092 --> 32:35.060
[music playing]

33:42.085 --> 33:43.293
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

33:43.328 --> 33:43.887
It's me.

33:43.922 --> 33:44.492
It's me.

33:51.897 --> 33:54.238
[tv playing loudly]

33:55.670 --> 33:58.473
Why is it--

33:58.508 --> 33:59.111
[tv shutting off]

33:59.146 --> 34:00.112
[bang]

34:00.147 --> 34:01.036
Jesus!

34:01.071 --> 34:02.004
OK, sorry.

34:05.009 --> 34:08.043
MAN (ON TV): Let me
take a whack at it.

34:08.078 --> 34:09.319
Demented fuck.

34:14.986 --> 34:21.727
So, just asking, no disrespect,
because I know you're like--

34:21.762 --> 34:26.567
but I pretty clearly said
scare her, not, you know,

34:26.602 --> 34:29.339
set her on fucking fire.

34:29.374 --> 34:40.185
So like-- yeah.

34:40.220 --> 34:41.450
Yeah, that sounds like Maggie.

34:41.485 --> 34:44.112
Jesus Christ.

34:44.147 --> 34:47.654
So was she, like,
alive when you--

34:50.989 --> 34:51.955
Well, thank God for that.

34:55.059 --> 34:57.862
So I got the cops fucking
knocking on my door, man.

34:57.897 --> 35:00.271
So I got a plan.

35:00.306 --> 35:02.031
You know my wife's
name, Maggie, right?

35:02.066 --> 35:04.275
Maggie Moore.

35:04.310 --> 35:07.135
Well, there's another Maggie
Moore, same exact fucking name,

35:07.170 --> 35:09.214
only a couple of miles away.

35:09.249 --> 35:15.352
So what I'm thinking
is if we-- you--

35:15.387 --> 35:19.114
remove the second
Maggie Moore, it'll

35:19.149 --> 35:22.623
make it look like the
first removal, my Maggie,

35:22.658 --> 35:26.121
was just a mistake,
like it was an accident.

35:26.156 --> 35:27.056
And I'm off the hook.

35:31.865 --> 35:35.339
I mean, they're not twins, but.

35:38.839 --> 35:39.409
Yeah?

35:53.260 --> 35:55.326
You didn't say anything
about me, right?

35:55.361 --> 35:55.953
To Maggie?

36:08.704 --> 36:10.770
Fuck.

36:10.805 --> 36:13.245
What the hell?

36:13.280 --> 36:14.708
Why would you tell her that?

36:14.743 --> 36:15.940
[shredding]

36:15.975 --> 36:16.875
Jesus Christ.

36:22.146 --> 36:26.291
PASTOR: Maggie, as you
all know, loved children,

36:26.326 --> 36:29.591
but not having been blessed
with children of her own,

36:29.626 --> 36:33.298
she feared her life
would be without meaning.

36:33.333 --> 36:35.223
It was not.

36:35.258 --> 36:37.093
Maggie was able to
find new meaning

36:37.128 --> 36:39.304
through her work at the diner.

36:39.339 --> 36:40.899
Why are you making me do this?

36:40.934 --> 36:42.736
Why do you make me
interrupt my route to come

36:42.771 --> 36:44.804
here to get what's mine, huh?

36:44.839 --> 36:46.707
Finder's fee ain't much,
not the way you were talking

36:46.742 --> 36:47.774
what a divorce would cost.

36:50.614 --> 36:51.448
Come on, man.

36:51.483 --> 36:52.779
I got to be the pastor.

36:52.814 --> 36:54.715
Right, because otherwise
you'll go to hell.

36:54.750 --> 36:55.980
Like, that's why you'll go.

37:08.764 --> 37:10.896
PASTOR: --and the truth of our
relationships with our friends

37:10.931 --> 37:15.670
and loved ones, the
truth within ourselves.

37:15.705 --> 37:19.740
You see, life is not about
the houses we live in,

37:19.775 --> 37:23.645
the cars we drive,
or the money we make.

37:23.680 --> 37:26.318
In times like these,
we realize that only

37:26.353 --> 37:28.749
three things truly matter--

37:28.784 --> 37:32.522
our health, our
family, and our faith.

37:32.557 --> 37:33.952
[phone vibrating]

37:37.155 --> 37:39.188
Police Chief Sanders?

37:39.223 --> 37:42.125
Did I interrupt you
refilling the pepper grinder?

37:42.160 --> 37:44.765
No, no, pepper refills are
performed at 10:00 and 6:00

37:44.800 --> 37:45.634
daily.

37:45.669 --> 37:46.965
I'm good for the night.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.134
[chuckles] Hey, listen.

37:51.169 --> 37:55.941
I was thinking, would
you want to maybe get

37:55.976 --> 37:58.515
some ice cream or something?

37:58.550 --> 38:00.011
I could come by if
it's not too late.

38:03.313 --> 38:05.456
Is that a yes, then?

38:05.491 --> 38:06.457
I'll pick you up?

38:06.492 --> 38:07.491
Sure.

38:07.526 --> 38:08.217
See you in a bit.

38:20.363 --> 38:21.901
Is yours as good as it looks?

38:21.936 --> 38:24.541
I'm not sharing.

38:24.576 --> 38:26.136
Hey, you know a decent mechanic?

38:26.171 --> 38:29.040
Because my dash is like
all warning lights.

38:29.075 --> 38:31.306
Uh, I do, actually.

38:31.341 --> 38:32.582
Who won't cheat me?

38:32.617 --> 38:33.979
Oh, no, he'll
definitely cheat you.

38:34.014 --> 38:35.849
But his work is solid.

38:40.889 --> 38:42.823
You know, I know we don't really
know each other that well,

38:42.858 --> 38:44.429
but I feel like something
might be bothering you.

38:44.464 --> 38:45.529
Am I wrong?

38:48.798 --> 38:52.998
When you were at my house, you
obviously knew Maggie was gone.

38:53.033 --> 38:55.539
We had a whole
conversation that--

38:55.574 --> 38:59.235
I don't know-- I just think
it's a little strange.

38:59.270 --> 39:00.709
And you're annoyed?

39:00.744 --> 39:03.338
Absolutely not annoyed.

39:03.373 --> 39:05.615
Mildly put out.

39:05.650 --> 39:07.243
That's fair.

39:07.278 --> 39:09.916
That I didn't tell you
about Maggie's murder

39:09.951 --> 39:11.918
before I told her husband.

39:11.953 --> 39:13.689
It was just
strange, like I said,

39:13.724 --> 39:16.626
to see the news that night and
think back on our conversation

39:16.661 --> 39:18.595
and how you didn't say a word.

39:18.630 --> 39:21.895
I am obligated to
inform the next of kin

39:21.930 --> 39:23.193
before the next door neighbor.

39:23.228 --> 39:24.194
Whatever.

39:24.229 --> 39:24.898
I'm always the last to know.

39:37.979 --> 39:38.780
You have a lot that's--

39:38.815 --> 39:40.243
[laughs]

39:40.278 --> 39:41.211
Yeah, there you go.

39:41.246 --> 39:41.816
Thank you.

39:45.756 --> 39:46.689
Want to go for a walk?

39:51.256 --> 39:53.465
Then I see him come out of the
bathroom with this other guy.

39:53.500 --> 39:56.259
And Jim looks like he's been
shoved around a little bit.

39:56.294 --> 39:57.799
And then the other
guy just roars

39:57.834 --> 39:59.163
off in this delivery truck.

39:59.198 --> 40:00.131
I don't know.

40:00.166 --> 40:01.429
I just thought it was odd.

40:01.464 --> 40:02.430
Hey, do you like to gamble?

40:02.465 --> 40:03.937
Because I work at the casino.

40:03.972 --> 40:05.070
And I don't know-- if you
ever wanted to come up--

40:05.105 --> 40:06.610
Hold on, go back.

40:06.645 --> 40:10.174
So Jay misses the beginning
of his wife's funeral

40:10.209 --> 40:12.440
because he's been shoved
around by some guy

40:12.475 --> 40:14.585
that drives the delivery truck?

40:14.620 --> 40:16.015
It was odd, right?

40:16.050 --> 40:19.524
See, I'm usually so not
even close on this stuff.

40:19.559 --> 40:24.452
Did you happen to see the
name on the side of the truck?

40:24.487 --> 40:26.927
Maybe there's
security footage?

40:26.962 --> 40:27.963
I watch a lot of SVU.

40:31.032 --> 40:31.800
Liberty.

40:31.835 --> 40:33.263
Liberty Bell Foods.

40:33.298 --> 40:36.673
I remember the bell.

40:36.708 --> 40:38.136
Junior detective.

40:41.174 --> 40:43.438
Hey, look who's
a sex offender.

40:43.473 --> 40:44.373
I didn't do nothing.

40:44.408 --> 40:45.110
Why am I here?

40:45.145 --> 40:45.979
Child porn?

40:46.014 --> 40:47.145
That's nothing to you?

40:47.180 --> 40:48.982
You can't arrest
me on that again.

40:49.017 --> 40:52.183
That's eminent domain.

40:52.218 --> 40:55.318
Well, you got us there,
Tommy T. What do you

40:55.353 --> 40:58.156
and Jay Moore have going
on at the sandwich shop?

40:58.191 --> 40:58.959
Nothing's going.

40:58.994 --> 40:59.960
What?

40:59.995 --> 41:01.632
With Liberty Bell Foods?

41:01.667 --> 41:03.634
Jay buys from you,
instead of corporate.

41:03.669 --> 41:04.569
Pro tip.

41:04.604 --> 41:06.461
We already know.

41:06.496 --> 41:07.836
Hey, you don't know shit.

41:07.871 --> 41:09.134
Why don't you go back to France?

41:09.169 --> 41:11.169
Leave us hard-working
Americans alone.

41:11.204 --> 41:14.843
Keep in mind you're in
a massive shitstorm here.

41:14.878 --> 41:17.648
[sighs] And it's all expired.

41:17.683 --> 41:20.508
They're just going to throw
that shit out anyways.

41:20.543 --> 41:21.883
The chips?

41:21.918 --> 41:25.480
Yeah, the chips, the
meat, cheese, all of it.

41:25.515 --> 41:31.486
So Jay buys expired food from
you and sells it at his place?

41:31.521 --> 41:32.861
That is so disgusting.

41:32.896 --> 41:34.929
And what do you
get out of this?

41:34.964 --> 41:38.163
Nothing, a couple of bucks.

41:38.198 --> 41:40.770
Well, see, we heard that
Jay and his wife Maggie

41:40.805 --> 41:42.871
got in a big fight right
before she was murdered,

41:42.906 --> 41:45.269
and the word "filth" came up.

41:45.304 --> 41:48.910
So I'm wondering, maybe in
exchange for this cheap,

41:48.945 --> 41:53.112
expired food, Jay provided
you with some form

41:53.147 --> 41:55.510
of sexual gratification
that you're not allowed

41:55.545 --> 41:56.852
to have in your possession?

41:56.887 --> 41:58.414
You sick fuck.

41:58.449 --> 41:59.217
Uh-uh.

41:59.252 --> 42:00.053
That's crazy.

42:00.088 --> 42:01.417
False.

42:01.452 --> 42:03.122
That's why she kicks
him out of the house.

42:03.157 --> 42:05.388
That's why she
initiates the divorce.

42:05.423 --> 42:06.961
You kill Maggie
Moore, Tommy T?

42:06.996 --> 42:07.698
Me?

42:07.733 --> 42:09.557
No fucking way!

42:09.592 --> 42:11.295
Maybe you know somebody
in that line of work.

42:11.330 --> 42:12.428
No, no, man.

42:12.463 --> 42:14.529
I swear on my mom's life.

42:14.564 --> 42:16.201
See, I know I
should believe you

42:16.236 --> 42:17.708
because you're such
an upstanding citizen,

42:17.743 --> 42:18.874
but I don't know.

42:18.909 --> 42:20.744
I'm starting to
warm to my theory.

42:20.779 --> 42:23.780
[ominous music]

42:49.269 --> 42:53.678
Please, take my bag.

42:53.713 --> 42:54.305
Take my jewelry.

42:58.311 --> 43:00.751
There's credit cards in there.

43:00.786 --> 43:02.049
I can give you the pins.

43:05.890 --> 43:08.616
Would you mind if I
kept my insulin kit?

43:08.651 --> 43:09.991
I have diabetes.

43:10.026 --> 43:10.860
It's not worth anything.

43:13.733 --> 43:16.426
Here, here.

43:16.461 --> 43:19.396
[dramatic music]

43:44.654 --> 43:46.324
[screaming] Help me!

43:46.359 --> 43:49.360
[crying]

44:05.917 --> 44:09.754
You got the other
Maggie, too, right?

44:09.789 --> 44:12.086
Did you make her think
you'd let her go, too?

44:17.357 --> 44:19.654
Fuck you, you twisted
piece of shit!

44:19.689 --> 44:20.292
Oh!

44:46.958 --> 44:48.452
[gunshot]

44:59.399 --> 45:00.068
Wow.

45:00.103 --> 45:02.070
You know what?

45:02.105 --> 45:06.041
They just-- there's this new
invention they came up with.

45:06.076 --> 45:07.570
It's called a car wash.

45:07.605 --> 45:09.814
And what they do is they
take all of the dirt off

45:09.849 --> 45:10.980
of the outside of
the car, and then

45:11.015 --> 45:12.113
you can see what color it is.

45:12.148 --> 45:13.147
Huh.

45:13.182 --> 45:15.281
I can't see that catching on.

45:15.316 --> 45:16.447
Really?

45:16.482 --> 45:18.053
You're not an
investor, I hope.

45:18.088 --> 45:20.088
So I changed the oil, and
the tire pressure was low.

45:20.123 --> 45:23.795
And the gas sensor was
the passenger side airbag.

45:23.830 --> 45:25.896
You need a new one.

45:25.931 --> 45:27.095
How much?

45:27.130 --> 45:29.724
3,200 plus tax.

45:29.759 --> 45:31.902
For a passenger airbag?

45:31.937 --> 45:34.399
I can't think of anyone
that I like that much.

45:34.434 --> 45:36.500
Yeah, that's a pass.

45:36.535 --> 45:37.072
All right.

45:37.107 --> 45:37.842
Sorry.

45:37.877 --> 45:38.909
Give me a minute.

45:38.944 --> 45:39.503
Thanks, Bud.

45:39.538 --> 45:41.076
Boss.

45:41.111 --> 45:41.846
3,200?

45:41.881 --> 45:43.144
That's nuts.

45:43.179 --> 45:44.772
Well, to be fair,
I did say Buddy would

45:44.807 --> 45:47.951
most likely try to cheat you.

45:47.986 --> 45:51.020
Oh, uh, I got to go.

45:51.055 --> 45:52.252
Are you going to be OK here?

45:52.287 --> 45:53.022
Yeah.

45:53.057 --> 45:54.518
You heard the man.

45:54.553 --> 45:55.992
Half of my air bags are
in perfect working order.

45:56.027 --> 45:57.752
Go be a policeman.

45:57.787 --> 46:00.590
Police chief,
thank you very much.

46:00.625 --> 46:01.965
Fancy badge.

46:02.000 --> 46:02.658
I'll call you later.

46:06.070 --> 46:07.938
Wash your car.

46:07.973 --> 46:09.269
Wash your ass.

46:09.304 --> 46:11.469
I heard that.

46:11.504 --> 46:13.438
[siren]

46:13.473 --> 46:16.276
The vehicle's registered to
Maggie Moore, lives a few miles

46:16.311 --> 46:17.145
from here.

46:17.180 --> 46:18.311
You say Maggie Moore?

46:18.346 --> 46:20.016
Weird, right?

46:20.051 --> 46:22.480
Two dead Maggie
Moores one week apart.

46:22.515 --> 46:23.613
Yeah, that's weird.

46:23.648 --> 46:24.251
Hey, chief.

46:31.326 --> 46:34.129
First Maggie's a mistake, so
he chops off this ring finger

46:34.164 --> 46:36.560
to prove he got it right?

46:36.595 --> 46:37.869
Prove to who?

46:37.904 --> 46:39.464
I'm thinking the husband.

46:39.499 --> 46:41.499
I mean, who else
would know the ring?

46:41.534 --> 46:42.665
That's assuming
she was married

46:42.700 --> 46:44.876
and assuming she wore a ring.

46:44.911 --> 46:47.703
We don't know any of that.

46:47.738 --> 46:50.244
Imagine that conversation,
the husband telling the guy he

46:50.279 --> 46:51.410
killed the wrong Maggie Moore.

46:51.445 --> 46:52.147
You're sure?

46:52.182 --> 46:53.214
Yeah, I'm sure.

46:53.249 --> 46:54.743
She's right here
making meatloaf.

46:54.778 --> 46:56.811
It would mean Tommy T
and Jay are off the hook.

46:56.846 --> 46:59.418
Yeah, and the end of the whole
Liberty Bell Foods conspiracy.

46:59.453 --> 47:01.057
I know how much you wanted
to make that happen.

47:06.262 --> 47:08.933
Did your wife
wear a wedding ring?

47:08.968 --> 47:10.759
Yes, matching.

47:10.794 --> 47:12.200
Can I get a picture, please?

47:15.700 --> 47:18.008
Got it.

47:18.043 --> 47:21.374
What can you
tell us, Mr. Moore?

47:21.409 --> 47:23.112
Anything going on in her life?

47:23.147 --> 47:25.015
Duane Rich.

47:25.050 --> 47:29.118
If you want to know who
did this, Duane Rich.

47:29.153 --> 47:30.845
OK?

47:30.880 --> 47:34.288
He worked with Maggie, just
gave her nothing but trouble.

47:34.323 --> 47:36.092
Made her life goddamn miserable.

47:36.127 --> 47:37.225
Was this at the credit union?

47:37.260 --> 47:38.589
Yeah.

47:38.624 --> 47:39.458
What kind of trouble
are we talking about?

47:39.493 --> 47:41.196
Hate crime stuff.

47:41.231 --> 47:44.397
He would leave like notes
with swastikas on her desk.

47:44.432 --> 47:46.102
She would come back from
lunch, and there would be

47:46.137 --> 47:48.203
like a web page open to ovens.

47:48.238 --> 47:49.435
KB: Because you're Jewish.

47:49.470 --> 47:50.634
Well, no shit
because she's Jewish.

47:53.837 --> 47:55.606
She went to HR.

47:55.641 --> 47:58.081
They finally fired his ass.

47:58.116 --> 48:01.051
Was there any concern on
her part with this Duane Rich

48:01.086 --> 48:04.384
that her life might
actually be in danger?

48:04.419 --> 48:07.123
She asked me for a gun.

48:07.158 --> 48:08.784
That's how scared she was.

48:08.819 --> 48:11.721
But I talked her out of it.

48:11.756 --> 48:13.459
I told her that she
was overreacting.

48:13.494 --> 48:15.164
The guy was just a bully.

48:18.004 --> 48:20.895
I was supposed to protect her.

48:20.930 --> 48:21.764
Look what I did.

48:26.210 --> 48:28.309
Seemed legit.

48:28.344 --> 48:30.014
Well, just because he
feels bad doesn't mean

48:30.049 --> 48:30.806
he didn't do it.

48:38.453 --> 48:40.321
Ma'am, please, I
got nothing to say.

48:40.356 --> 48:42.026
Another woman was
murdered with the same name

48:42.061 --> 48:42.950
as your wife.

48:42.985 --> 48:43.621
You must have an opinion.

48:43.656 --> 48:44.919
My opinion?

48:44.954 --> 48:46.327
My opinion is that
I am grief stricken.

48:46.362 --> 48:48.857
And you should be
ashamed of yourself.

48:48.892 --> 48:50.793
Jesus Christ.

48:50.828 --> 48:52.927
Sorry about the
ruckus here, sir.

48:52.962 --> 48:53.763
I got this, Greg.

48:53.798 --> 48:56.667
Take out the trash.

48:56.702 --> 48:58.042
What are we having today, sir?

48:58.077 --> 49:03.542
Uh, turkey provolone
foot long on wheat.

49:03.577 --> 49:05.808
All right.

49:05.843 --> 49:06.677
Turkey provolone.

49:06.712 --> 49:07.876
How's your day going?

49:07.911 --> 49:08.547
Excellent.

49:08.582 --> 49:09.449
Yeah?

49:09.484 --> 49:11.451
You win the mega ball?

49:11.486 --> 49:12.221
Yeah, I'm just kidding.

49:36.874 --> 49:39.347
[clearing throat]

49:39.382 --> 49:40.876
Something wrong, sir?

49:45.685 --> 49:46.486
Seriously?

49:46.521 --> 49:47.322
You went undercover?

49:47.357 --> 49:48.224
This isn't our meat.

49:48.259 --> 49:49.159
This isn't our cheese.

49:49.194 --> 49:50.259
This isn't our produce.

49:50.294 --> 49:51.755
These aren't even
our snack chips.

49:51.790 --> 49:55.924
What you do have
is a lot of mold.

49:55.959 --> 49:59.862
Yeah, that's avocado,
I'm pretty sure.

49:59.897 --> 50:03.371
You're in breach of your
franchise agreement, Mr. Moore.

50:03.406 --> 50:06.704
Look, man, I
just lost my wife.

50:06.739 --> 50:09.872
The poor woman was murdered.

50:09.907 --> 50:11.280
I'm sorry for your loss.

50:11.315 --> 50:12.743
I am.

50:12.778 --> 50:14.085
But this is a serious violation.

50:14.120 --> 50:14.712
I know.

50:14.747 --> 50:16.087
I know.

50:16.122 --> 50:17.847
But can you just, like,
do me a solid human

50:17.882 --> 50:21.389
being a human being?

50:21.424 --> 50:22.588
I didn't even get
to say goodbye.

50:22.623 --> 50:23.754
She was burned up so bad.

50:27.331 --> 50:29.925
$600.

50:29.960 --> 50:31.729
Sorry?

50:31.764 --> 50:32.862
You're asking me to help you.

50:32.897 --> 50:34.600
I'm helping you.

50:34.635 --> 50:36.866
For $600?

50:36.901 --> 50:41.442
What price would you put on
keeping your shop open, huh?

50:41.477 --> 50:43.609
Get the fuck out.

50:43.644 --> 50:45.941
That's my fucking price?

50:45.976 --> 50:48.449
Get out of my shop, man.

50:48.484 --> 50:49.714
Go!

50:49.749 --> 50:51.320
Are you fucking
serious with this, man?

50:51.355 --> 50:52.882
OK.

50:52.917 --> 50:54.422
I'm a goddamn widower!

51:03.631 --> 51:04.201
Shit.

51:14.675 --> 51:15.278
Hey, hey.

51:18.217 --> 51:20.283
I'm sorry.

51:20.318 --> 51:21.647
It's been a rough
couple of weeks.

51:24.190 --> 51:25.189
600.

51:37.632 --> 51:38.202
Duane Rich?

51:43.209 --> 51:45.132
I don't know
what you've heard.

51:45.167 --> 51:48.311
Well, I'll tell you what
we've heard, Mr. Rich.

51:48.346 --> 51:50.940
Maggie's husband said that
you continuously harassed

51:50.975 --> 51:54.350
her and were anti-Semitic.

51:54.385 --> 51:56.946
And HR said that you
were fired from your job

51:56.981 --> 51:59.718
for those very reasons.

51:59.753 --> 52:02.688
Well, here's the thing is,
I don't dispute any of that.

52:05.528 --> 52:07.121
The way I behaved,
it was shameful.

52:07.156 --> 52:10.795
And I am mortified by it.

52:10.830 --> 52:13.501
Then why did you do it?

52:13.536 --> 52:19.309
Well, because I was a drunk.

52:19.344 --> 52:21.311
I'm an alcoholic.

52:21.346 --> 52:24.908
And getting let go,
that saved my life.

52:24.943 --> 52:27.141
I went to a meeting
that night and--

52:27.176 --> 52:28.747
What night?

52:28.782 --> 52:32.256
The night I got fired, and
I've been going ever since.

52:32.291 --> 52:35.853
So writing "death to
kikes" on her desk calendar,

52:35.888 --> 52:39.087
you attribute that to the booze?

52:39.122 --> 52:39.758
I liked Maggie.

52:42.631 --> 52:44.730
And I hit on Maggie, and
when she rejected me,

52:44.765 --> 52:47.095
I acted like a whiny
little high schooler.

52:47.130 --> 52:48.734
I don't hate Jews.

52:48.769 --> 52:51.165
I don't hate anybody.

52:51.200 --> 52:52.199
I was just a jackass.

52:52.234 --> 52:54.542
[doorbell]

52:54.577 --> 52:55.136
Excuse me.

53:02.618 --> 53:04.288
Hey.

53:04.323 --> 53:05.850
Just get started.

53:05.885 --> 53:06.455
I'll be down.

53:09.251 --> 53:11.427
We hold meetings here.

53:11.462 --> 53:14.221
Well, Mr. Rich, thank
you for your time.

53:14.256 --> 53:17.125
We'll let you know if
we find anything else.

53:17.160 --> 53:19.798
Put it back.

53:19.833 --> 53:22.834
[music playing]

54:00.676 --> 54:01.642
Ah.

54:01.677 --> 54:02.643
No.

54:02.678 --> 54:03.677
I think mine's defective.

54:03.712 --> 54:04.348
I don't get it.

54:04.383 --> 54:05.140
How about yours?

54:05.175 --> 54:06.009
Oh, always broken.

54:06.044 --> 54:07.615
No, I never win.

54:07.650 --> 54:09.419
I might as well just toss
my quarters in the street.

54:09.454 --> 54:10.684
Well, I wouldn't
take it personally.

54:10.719 --> 54:13.115
I do think losing is
kind of the point.

54:13.150 --> 54:14.083
No, I know.

54:14.118 --> 54:14.683
That's why I fit right in.

54:17.363 --> 54:18.252
Where else should we lose?

54:18.287 --> 54:20.991
Oh, so many choices.

54:21.026 --> 54:22.828
Hey, Rita, something to drink?

54:22.863 --> 54:25.292
Ooh, I will have
your finest white wine

54:25.327 --> 54:26.601
spritzer please, Jody.

54:26.636 --> 54:27.602
And a Budweiser.

54:27.637 --> 54:28.229
Thank you.

54:31.476 --> 54:33.300
That's impressive.

54:33.335 --> 54:35.038
Full eye contact
despite the boobage.

54:35.073 --> 54:36.644
Good job.

54:36.679 --> 54:38.041
What?

54:38.076 --> 54:40.274
Pretty girl with a nice
body is just genetics.

54:40.309 --> 54:41.979
If she could play the piano,
then I'd be impressed.

54:42.014 --> 54:44.982
[laughs] Oh, OK.

54:45.017 --> 54:47.853
Well, this is a game
of skill and strategy.

54:47.888 --> 54:49.987
Yes, I know roulette
is for suckers,

54:50.022 --> 54:52.693
but I have a foolproof system.

54:52.728 --> 54:54.288
Watch.

54:54.323 --> 54:56.565
DEALER: No more bets.

54:56.600 --> 54:57.566
I'm going to get us a room.

55:05.037 --> 55:06.575
DEALER: 24 black.

55:06.610 --> 55:08.445
Hey, look over there, huh?

55:11.681 --> 55:12.812
This is it.

55:12.847 --> 55:16.750
You ready for the sex?

55:16.785 --> 55:17.355
I'm ready.

55:29.226 --> 55:31.259
OK, that didn't go well.

55:31.294 --> 55:33.261
Yeah, I feel it's my fault.

55:33.296 --> 55:34.361
No, it's not.

55:34.396 --> 55:35.032
You're not into me.

55:35.067 --> 55:35.901
It's fine.

55:35.936 --> 55:36.836
That is not the case.

55:36.871 --> 55:39.267
That is not the case.

55:39.302 --> 55:42.776
I'm just feeling a little
guilty, I think, is all.

55:42.811 --> 55:43.843
Guilty about what?

55:43.878 --> 55:48.111
The sex, the having the sex.

55:48.146 --> 55:51.521
Oh, no, really?

55:51.556 --> 55:53.457
There's been no one?

55:53.492 --> 55:54.887
No.

55:54.922 --> 55:57.725
No, and I don't
know what to say.

55:57.760 --> 56:00.926
I just feel like
I'm still attached

56:00.961 --> 56:05.128
to her somehow in my heart.

56:05.163 --> 56:08.098
Yeah, I know.

56:08.133 --> 56:10.771
Believe me, I know how
cheesy that sounds.

56:10.806 --> 56:11.904
That doesn't make it not true.

56:16.240 --> 56:19.912
You know what else is true?

56:19.947 --> 56:23.080
Every day when I wake
up, I think about you.

56:23.115 --> 56:26.820
And every time I see you,
my heart beats so loud,

56:26.855 --> 56:29.119
I can't believe
you can't hear it.

56:29.154 --> 56:30.560
You don't have
to say that stuff.

56:30.595 --> 56:33.222
I know I'm no bargain.

56:33.257 --> 56:34.960
What?

56:34.995 --> 56:36.225
Why do you do that?

56:36.260 --> 56:38.799
Why do you put yourself
down like that?

56:38.834 --> 56:40.504
I don't.

56:40.539 --> 56:42.132
You do.

56:42.167 --> 56:45.135
You say things like,
my ex broke me,

56:45.170 --> 56:47.907
and I never can catch a break,
and I know I'm no bargain.

56:47.942 --> 56:49.139
Like, what is that?

56:49.174 --> 56:51.845
Why?

56:51.880 --> 56:53.341
Maybe we're both mental cases.

56:56.819 --> 56:58.379
I'm pretty sure they have robes.

57:04.992 --> 57:06.420
Ms. Novak, what
new information

57:06.455 --> 57:09.698
do you have on the murder
of Maggie Lee Moore?

57:09.733 --> 57:11.799
Andy would come into my
bar all the time, you know?

57:11.834 --> 57:15.264
Buy me a shot, flirt with me.

57:15.299 --> 57:17.871
Not really my type,
but I don't know.

57:17.906 --> 57:20.335
We kind of hit it off
after a little while.

57:20.370 --> 57:22.810
I didn't know he was
married, you know.

57:22.845 --> 57:28.013
What was it like the first
time after your divorce?

57:28.048 --> 57:31.049
It was pretty nerve
racking, actually.

57:31.084 --> 57:36.626
Different body, different
feel, different smell.

57:36.661 --> 57:38.155
I mean, all the
pieces were the same,

57:38.190 --> 57:43.028
but it was just so peculiar.

57:43.063 --> 57:44.491
But you got through it.

57:44.526 --> 57:46.031
I did get through it.

57:46.066 --> 57:48.803
Yeah, I persevered,
and I did my damnedest.

57:48.838 --> 57:52.070
And then when it was over,
I hydrated and stretched

57:52.105 --> 57:54.237
a little bit and
got back in there.

57:54.272 --> 57:55.238
Atta, girl.

57:55.273 --> 57:56.679
You are a true American hero.

57:56.714 --> 58:02.047
[chuckles] You're right
about the victim stuff.

58:02.082 --> 58:04.247
I could go through
the whole list--

58:04.282 --> 58:10.220
parents, boyfriends,
bosses, my ex, my realtor.

58:10.255 --> 58:11.661
Everybody gets their way.

58:11.696 --> 58:13.663
Don't mind me.

58:13.698 --> 58:16.490
I'm pathetic.

58:16.525 --> 58:17.524
And I just did it again.

58:17.559 --> 58:19.328
Yeah, stop doing that.

58:19.363 --> 58:21.396
Stop letting it happen.

58:21.431 --> 58:24.938
Stop letting yourself
get steamrolled.

58:24.973 --> 58:26.940
Otherwise, what's
even the point?

58:32.717 --> 58:33.276
What the hell?

58:36.820 --> 58:38.853
REPORTER (ON TV):
To be clear, are

58:38.888 --> 58:43.220
you claiming Andy Moore told you
he planned to murder his wife?

58:43.255 --> 58:46.091
About a month ago, he said
he wanted her gone so that we

58:46.126 --> 58:48.962
could be together, which I
thought was just a dumb line

58:48.997 --> 58:52.097
until, you know, she was gone.

58:52.132 --> 58:53.527
Did you hear that?

58:53.562 --> 58:55.397
She just dropped a dime
on Maggie Lee's husband.

58:55.432 --> 58:56.772
Yeah.

58:56.807 --> 58:58.807
I have to say, Andy
was a gentleman with me.

58:58.842 --> 59:02.140
But his eyes were always
a little weird, you know?

59:02.175 --> 59:05.539
He always scared
me just a little.

59:05.574 --> 59:08.245
And how long were you having
an affair with Mr. Moore?

59:08.280 --> 59:09.818
About four months.

59:09.853 --> 59:12.887
Off the record, tiny dick.

59:12.922 --> 59:14.152
But he loved the gem.

59:14.187 --> 59:16.550
He'd stay down there for hours.

59:16.585 --> 59:18.585
You do know you're talking
to the police right now, right?

59:18.620 --> 59:20.257
She's just giving
us a little color.

59:20.292 --> 59:22.556
She's just filling
in the details.

59:22.591 --> 59:25.130
Did Mr. Moore
ever mention to you

59:25.165 --> 59:26.835
how he planned on
dealing with Mrs. Moore

59:26.870 --> 59:28.562
and getting her
out of the picture?

59:28.597 --> 59:32.467
Oh, you mean like the lead
pipe or a rope or a revolver?

59:32.502 --> 59:33.974
Uh, no.

59:34.009 --> 59:35.646
No.

59:35.681 --> 59:37.604
Maybe did he ever say maybe
he was going to call somebody

59:37.639 --> 59:39.441
or that he knew a guy?

59:39.476 --> 59:42.752
Oh, yeah, Duane.

59:42.787 --> 59:45.821
I don't know his last name,
but I remember he said Duane

59:45.856 --> 59:47.790
would do it in a heartbeat.

59:47.825 --> 59:50.188
Do you have some way of
proving your relationship

59:50.223 --> 59:51.761
with Mr. Moore?

59:51.796 --> 59:54.698
He was very, very
careful about being seen.

59:54.733 --> 59:58.163
And he always paid, so I don't
have, like, any receipts.

59:58.198 --> 59:59.967
Maybe you could give
us a list of places

01:00:00.002 --> 01:00:01.463
you went so we can verify it.

01:00:01.498 --> 01:00:03.135
Oh, yeah, I can just do that.

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:06.875
I kept a journal in case there's
ever a book about my life.

01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:10.538
She had insurance,
BTW, Maggie did.

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:12.177
Life insurance?

01:00:12.212 --> 01:00:12.815
700k.

01:00:15.677 --> 01:00:18.348
This nutcase is setting me up.

01:00:18.383 --> 01:00:20.548
I mean, it's bad
enough what happened.

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:21.956
Now I got to deal with this?

01:00:21.991 --> 01:00:25.058
Any idea why she would
do this, set you up?

01:00:25.093 --> 01:00:26.994
Obviously, she's
an attention whore.

01:00:27.029 --> 01:00:29.128
I mean, look at her, right?

01:00:29.163 --> 01:00:30.525
She's loving this.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.999
OK, but how did she
know your wife had

01:00:32.034 --> 01:00:34.705
700k worth of life insurance?

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.905
Maybe she knows
someone who knew Maggie?

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.039
I mean, she mentioned
Duane, right?

01:00:39.074 --> 01:00:41.712
Maybe they're buddies
from Nazi camp.

01:00:41.747 --> 01:00:43.208
Well, right now,
there's nothing to suggest

01:00:43.243 --> 01:00:44.374
he was involved with this.

01:00:44.409 --> 01:00:45.980
Nothing to suggest
he was involved,

01:00:46.015 --> 01:00:48.719
the guy who wanted to actually
shove her into an oven.

01:00:48.754 --> 01:00:49.852
Do you say anything
at any point,

01:00:49.887 --> 01:00:51.348
or are you just here to observe?

01:00:51.383 --> 01:00:52.723
Answer the
officer's questions,

01:00:52.758 --> 01:00:55.022
Andy, and try to keep
an even temperament.

01:00:55.057 --> 01:00:56.650
This is not easy for anybody.

01:00:56.685 --> 01:00:57.486
Easy for you.

01:00:57.521 --> 01:00:59.059
You just sit there.

01:00:59.094 --> 01:01:00.588
What about a polygraph?

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:02.326
It might help to
clear some things up.

01:01:02.361 --> 01:01:03.360
I'm on Lexapro.

01:01:03.395 --> 01:01:05.428
It can screw with the results.

01:01:05.463 --> 01:01:09.366
If I had a lawyer, he
would back me up on that.

01:01:09.401 --> 01:01:12.369
At this point, I don't see
what else Mr. Moore can offer.

01:01:12.404 --> 01:01:14.778
He was here at work at the
time of his wife's death,

01:01:14.813 --> 01:01:17.044
and nothing connects him
with that horrific crime,

01:01:17.079 --> 01:01:20.784
except the unsubstantiated
claim of a complete stranger.

01:01:20.819 --> 01:01:23.248
So unless there's
something else,

01:01:23.283 --> 01:01:25.382
I see no reason to waste
any more of his time.

01:01:29.124 --> 01:01:30.453
Nope.

01:01:30.488 --> 01:01:32.422
I think that's all
we have for now.

01:01:32.457 --> 01:01:33.896
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:01:33.931 --> 01:01:34.556
Andy.

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:39.902
When he does say something,
he makes a decent point.

01:01:42.808 --> 01:01:45.402
What does that
word mean to you?

01:01:45.437 --> 01:01:46.469
Pleasure?

01:01:46.504 --> 01:01:48.042
Contentment?

01:01:48.077 --> 01:01:49.912
State of well-being?

01:01:49.947 --> 01:01:52.046
Does money make you happy?

01:01:52.081 --> 01:01:53.883
Does your partner?

01:01:53.918 --> 01:01:54.741
Good friends?

01:01:54.776 --> 01:01:56.413
A good steak?

01:01:56.448 --> 01:01:58.481
What about you?

01:01:58.516 --> 01:02:01.583
Figure it out because
that's your next assignment.

01:02:01.618 --> 01:02:03.156
REPORTER (ON TV): The
latest in the Maggie Moore

01:02:03.191 --> 01:02:04.993
murder case,
reporters confronted

01:02:05.028 --> 01:02:06.390
Andy Moore outside of his home.

01:02:06.425 --> 01:02:07.424
I don't know this woman.

01:02:07.459 --> 01:02:08.964
I had nothing to do with this.

01:02:08.999 --> 01:02:11.593
You want to talk to someone,
you talk to Duane Rich.

01:02:11.628 --> 01:02:13.430
Ask him about the death threats.

01:02:13.465 --> 01:02:15.465
Duane Rich.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.499
Yeah!

01:02:16.534 --> 01:02:18.501
Yeah, Duane Rich, motherfuckers!

01:02:18.536 --> 01:02:20.569
He killed both
our fucking wives!

01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:22.307
Yeah.

01:02:22.342 --> 01:02:25.915
Duane Rich, Duane Rich, Duane
Rich, Duane Rich, Duane Rich,

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:28.181
Duane Rich, Duane
Rich, Duane Rich,

01:02:28.216 --> 01:02:33.450
Duane Rich, Duane
Rich, Duane Rich,

01:02:33.485 --> 01:02:37.256
Duane Rich, Duane Rich, Duane!

01:02:37.291 --> 01:02:38.290
[helena, "do it to 'em"]

01:02:38.325 --> 01:02:39.027
HELENA: (SINGING) Do it to 'em.

01:02:39.062 --> 01:02:40.358
Do it to 'em.

01:02:40.393 --> 01:02:42.096
He going to love it
when I do it to 'em.

01:02:42.131 --> 01:02:42.932
Do it to 'em.

01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:43.790
Do it to 'em.

01:02:43.825 --> 01:02:47.200
Do it to 'em.

01:02:47.235 --> 01:02:48.597
Do it to 'em.

01:02:48.632 --> 01:02:50.973
Everywhere he's gotta
bust my fucking ears.

01:02:51.008 --> 01:02:52.205
HELENA: (SINGING) Do it to 'em.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.536
Do it to 'em.

01:02:53.571 --> 01:02:54.504
He going to love it
when I do it to 'em.

01:02:54.539 --> 01:02:56.176
Hey.

01:02:56.211 --> 01:02:56.847
Hey.

01:02:56.882 --> 01:02:59.641
Ugh!

01:02:59.676 --> 01:03:00.774
HELENA: (SINGING)
Here's a secret.

01:03:00.809 --> 01:03:02.512
This pussy undefeated.

01:03:02.547 --> 01:03:03.854
Bend it over, touch your toes.

01:03:03.889 --> 01:03:05.856
I know you want to see it.

01:03:05.891 --> 01:03:08.958
Ass so thick like a
panoramic picture.

01:03:08.993 --> 01:03:10.124
Show me something good.

01:03:10.159 --> 01:03:11.356
What the fuck, man?

01:03:16.066 --> 01:03:17.527
So the husband
pretty much fingered

01:03:17.562 --> 01:03:19.034
that Duane Rich guy for us.

01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:20.827
You following this?

01:03:20.862 --> 01:03:21.498
Got a light?

01:03:26.604 --> 01:03:27.977
You mind, darling?

01:03:28.012 --> 01:03:29.572
I'm trying to conduct
some business here.

01:03:29.607 --> 01:03:31.013
Then go rent a fucking office.

01:03:38.957 --> 01:03:41.683
You got to make it look
like a suicide, all right?

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:43.751
He kills himself out of,
like, guilt or whatnot.

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:45.489
We're home free.

01:03:45.524 --> 01:03:46.226
You feel me?

01:03:49.132 --> 01:03:49.724
All good, baby.

01:04:09.317 --> 01:04:10.118
How are we doing?

01:04:10.153 --> 01:04:11.350
Oh, all right.

01:04:11.385 --> 01:04:12.417
You?

01:04:12.452 --> 01:04:13.451
OK.

01:04:13.486 --> 01:04:16.454
I mean, under the circumstances.

01:04:16.489 --> 01:04:18.522
Still grieving, of course.

01:04:18.557 --> 01:04:20.293
Yeah, of course.

01:04:20.328 --> 01:04:21.855
Yeah, I don't know if
you've been keeping up,

01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:26.134
but they're closing in on
the guy, this Duane Rich.

01:04:26.169 --> 01:04:26.937
That's good.

01:04:26.972 --> 01:04:28.070
That's good news.

01:04:28.105 --> 01:04:29.104
Yeah.

01:04:29.139 --> 01:04:30.765
Yeah, it is for closure's sake.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.799
You know?

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:33.735
It'd be nice to finally move on.

01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:35.011
Well, it's only
been a few days.

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:42.150
I'm just saying, you don't
want to rush it emotionally.

01:04:42.185 --> 01:04:43.283
Oh, yeah.

01:04:43.318 --> 01:04:44.482
No, no, that's right.

01:04:44.517 --> 01:04:45.153
You're right.

01:04:45.188 --> 01:04:47.089
Take it slow.

01:04:47.124 --> 01:04:49.454
But just things are turning
around, is my point.

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:52.820
Well, I'm glad.

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:54.162
Have a great day.

01:04:54.197 --> 01:04:54.756
JAY: You, too.

01:05:00.599 --> 01:05:02.500
[phone rings]

01:05:05.934 --> 01:05:09.078
List of 13 different bars,
restaurants, and motels

01:05:09.113 --> 01:05:11.443
that Cassie Novak says she
and Andy Moore were together

01:05:11.478 --> 01:05:12.807
in just this last month.

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:16.349
March 4, 7:16 PM,
the Red Pub Inn.

01:05:16.384 --> 01:05:20.023
Six Sam Adams, two
margaritas, wings with ranch.

01:05:20.058 --> 01:05:22.256
She even wrote in
the extra napkins.

01:05:22.291 --> 01:05:23.653
Sure did.

01:05:23.688 --> 01:05:24.456
But here's the thing.

01:05:24.491 --> 01:05:27.162
It all checks out.

01:05:27.197 --> 01:05:28.460
It all checks out?

01:05:28.495 --> 01:05:29.692
I called every
place on the list.

01:05:29.727 --> 01:05:32.365
Every place has a
matching receipt.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:38.206
Well, I think we need to
pay Andy Moore another visit.

01:05:38.241 --> 01:05:39.108
Hey, Rita.

01:05:39.143 --> 01:05:40.142
Can I call you back?

01:05:40.177 --> 01:05:41.440
I'm just walking out the door.

01:05:41.475 --> 01:05:43.178
OK, but I just ran
into Jay at the house,

01:05:43.213 --> 01:05:46.115
and he said you're closing in
on Duane Rich for the murders.

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:47.347
Why would he say that?

01:05:47.382 --> 01:05:49.151
I just thought you
would want to know.

01:05:49.186 --> 01:05:50.548
He seemed pretty sure about it.

01:05:50.583 --> 01:05:53.023
Also, we haven't really
talked since the casino.

01:05:53.058 --> 01:05:54.057
Did I ruin everything?

01:05:54.092 --> 01:05:55.223
No.

01:05:55.258 --> 01:05:56.686
Like I said, I'm
just out the door.

01:05:56.721 --> 01:05:57.522
I'll talk to you later.

01:05:57.557 --> 01:05:59.161
RITA (ON PHONE): OK.

01:05:59.196 --> 01:06:01.559
Trouble in paradise?

01:06:01.594 --> 01:06:02.890
Maybe we're just friends, KB.

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:06.333
Not everything
has to end in sex.

01:06:06.368 --> 01:06:08.896
The Dew Drop Inn,
this was the 17th.

01:06:08.931 --> 01:06:10.733
Cash for the room,
cash for dinner,

01:06:10.768 --> 01:06:13.472
two ribeye, two baked
potato, butter on the side--

01:06:13.507 --> 01:06:14.737
OK!

01:06:14.772 --> 01:06:15.969
OK, yeah, yeah.

01:06:16.004 --> 01:06:17.641
OK, we had an affair.

01:06:17.676 --> 01:06:19.412
--on the apple pie.

01:06:19.447 --> 01:06:20.578
Why did you lie to us, Andy?

01:06:20.613 --> 01:06:22.415
[sighs] Because
it had no relevance

01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:24.813
to Maggie's death and could
only fuck me in the ass.

01:06:24.848 --> 01:06:26.551
OK, well, look at it
from our perspective.

01:06:26.586 --> 01:06:28.014
If you lied about
one thing, maybe

01:06:28.049 --> 01:06:29.554
you lied about another thing.

01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:32.326
Yeah, yeah, you know, I
realize it sounds insincere

01:06:32.361 --> 01:06:35.494
because I did lie about Cassie,
who is a lunatic, by the way,

01:06:35.529 --> 01:06:37.859
keeping track of butter,
but everything else,

01:06:37.894 --> 01:06:41.269
I swear to you, is the truth.

01:06:41.304 --> 01:06:43.106
So Cassie, she
made up the story

01:06:43.141 --> 01:06:45.207
of you getting Duane to kill
Maggie so the two of you

01:06:45.242 --> 01:06:46.505
could be together?

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:47.407
Yeah.

01:06:47.442 --> 01:06:49.904
We were stoned, you know?

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:53.776
It was a bullshit
heavy metal fantasy.

01:06:53.811 --> 01:06:57.219
Look, even if I wanted
out of the marriage,

01:06:57.254 --> 01:07:02.752
for Maggie's life to end like
that, I'd rather it was me.

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:07.625
You believe that?

01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:09.198
I'm not sure.

01:07:09.233 --> 01:07:11.761
So we've got nothing
solid on two murders now.

01:07:11.796 --> 01:07:13.598
How's that possible?

01:07:13.633 --> 01:07:16.436
Was Maggie 1 a
mistake for Maggie 2,

01:07:16.471 --> 01:07:18.273
or was Maggie 2 the
cover for Maggie 1?

01:07:24.809 --> 01:07:26.215
No evidence either way.

01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:29.218
Just a bunch of people
that deserve each other.

01:07:29.253 --> 01:07:31.286
Somebody out there is really
good at what they're doing.

01:07:39.164 --> 01:07:41.329
Good night, guys.

01:07:41.364 --> 01:07:41.989
Get home safe.

01:07:46.699 --> 01:07:48.138
[knocking]

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:54.243
Next time you leave
it, it's fine-- oh!

01:07:54.278 --> 01:07:57.279
[muffled grunting]

01:09:36.776 --> 01:09:37.247
Hey.

01:09:43.651 --> 01:09:46.179
Suicide note.

01:09:46.214 --> 01:09:47.917
But wait, there's more.

01:09:47.952 --> 01:09:50.656
Confessions to both
Maggie Moore murders.

01:09:53.463 --> 01:09:56.090
Well, that ties it all up in
a nice little bow, doesn't it?

01:09:59.469 --> 01:10:01.370
Oh, I share your misery.

01:10:01.405 --> 01:10:02.899
I really do.

01:10:02.934 --> 01:10:05.605
Closing two cases with
the murderer's confession.

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.068
It's the absolute worst.

01:10:07.103 --> 01:10:09.136
A confession
written on a laptop.

01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:10.874
What, you want a
handwritten note?

01:10:10.909 --> 01:10:12.942
Nobody writes anymore.

01:10:12.977 --> 01:10:14.581
You're lucky he didn't
post it on Snapchat.

01:10:17.784 --> 01:10:19.014
Because it would disappear.

01:10:22.492 --> 01:10:25.053
Well, 2 o'clock's
got her eye on you.

01:10:25.088 --> 01:10:27.055
2 o'clock is a
cigarette machine.

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:30.432
My 2 o'clock.

01:10:30.467 --> 01:10:33.127
My 10 o'clock, sorry.

01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:33.798
Yeah.

01:10:38.266 --> 01:10:38.869
Hi.

01:10:42.006 --> 01:10:43.313
I'm going to send
her a drink for you.

01:10:43.348 --> 01:10:44.974
Just think of something
clever to say.

01:10:45.009 --> 01:10:46.272
Tell you what, tell
you what, tell them

01:10:46.307 --> 01:10:49.814
that I'm going to go see Rita.

01:10:49.849 --> 01:10:52.113
I'm tired of being just friends.

01:10:52.148 --> 01:10:54.984
And what's the point of
Duane killing Maggie 1

01:10:55.019 --> 01:10:56.623
if he already knows Maggie 2?

01:10:56.658 --> 01:10:58.757
If he doesn't know Maggie
2, he kills Maggie 1, fine,

01:10:58.792 --> 01:10:59.692
it's a big mistake.

01:10:59.727 --> 01:11:01.628
But he does know Maggie 2.

01:11:01.663 --> 01:11:03.366
They work together.

01:11:03.401 --> 01:11:05.093
I'm just asking.

01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:07.667
To confuse the issue so we'd
have doubts he was our guy.

01:11:07.702 --> 01:11:09.438
I mean, look how it's working.

01:11:09.473 --> 01:11:10.439
He's a genius.

01:11:10.474 --> 01:11:12.639
Yeah, well, something's off.

01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:23.078
[knocking]

01:11:24.147 --> 01:11:24.849
Hey.

01:11:24.884 --> 01:11:25.784
Hey.

01:11:25.819 --> 01:11:27.390
Not too late, is it?

01:11:27.425 --> 01:11:30.558
No, just usually you call.

01:11:30.593 --> 01:11:32.153
Oh, I know.

01:11:32.188 --> 01:11:33.396
I'm trying to be a little
more spontaneous these days.

01:11:33.431 --> 01:11:34.991
I hear the ladies
really like that.

01:11:37.996 --> 01:11:39.699
Can I come in?

01:11:39.734 --> 01:11:43.439
Actually, I'm-- it's
not a real good time.

01:11:47.577 --> 01:11:48.202
Oh.

01:11:51.174 --> 01:11:52.415
Oh, Christ.

01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:57.981
Hey.

01:11:58.016 --> 01:12:00.654
You know, I have
opportunities, too.

01:12:00.689 --> 01:12:03.316
In fact, 10 minutes ago--

01:12:03.351 --> 01:12:04.152
He's a friend.

01:12:04.187 --> 01:12:05.494
I've known him forever.

01:12:05.529 --> 01:12:06.495
He's your fuck buddy, right?

01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:07.353
Is that what they say?

01:12:07.388 --> 01:12:09.564
He's your fuck buddy?

01:12:09.599 --> 01:12:10.356
I'm not judging you.

01:12:10.391 --> 01:12:11.401
Let me be clear.

01:12:11.436 --> 01:12:12.765
You're absolutely judging me.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.405
I absolutely am because
I thought maybe you

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:16.901
and I had something
here, you know?

01:12:16.936 --> 01:12:21.939
I thought you and
I had something.

01:12:21.974 --> 01:12:25.008
Well, none of
that has changed.

01:12:25.043 --> 01:12:27.450
Of course it's changed.

01:12:27.485 --> 01:12:28.275
Of course it has.

01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:34.182
He's my ex, OK?

01:12:34.217 --> 01:12:37.383
It's just once in a while.

01:12:37.418 --> 01:12:39.627
Your ex?

01:12:39.662 --> 01:12:42.927
The guy who broke
you down pretty good?

01:12:42.962 --> 01:12:45.028
I'll end it right
now if you tell me to.

01:12:45.063 --> 01:12:47.569
Well, what if your ex
tells you the opposite?

01:12:50.431 --> 01:12:51.298
I got to go.

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:04.080
I made a report on Maggie 2.

01:13:04.115 --> 01:13:07.215
Also, Tommy T busted.

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:09.921
Dipshit tried to pick
up a minor online.

01:13:09.956 --> 01:13:11.659
Anything in here
I need to know?

01:13:11.694 --> 01:13:15.421
Maggie 2 was type I diabetic,
insulin in her system.

01:13:15.456 --> 01:13:18.292
But otherwise, she's clean.

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:20.063
She has a fuck buddy.

01:13:20.098 --> 01:13:21.471
Maggie 2?

01:13:21.506 --> 01:13:22.901
Rita.

01:13:22.936 --> 01:13:24.639
Rita has a fuck
buddy, her ex-husband.

01:13:24.674 --> 01:13:27.268
Can you believe that?

01:13:27.303 --> 01:13:31.811
Well, obviously, you
weren't satisfying her.

01:13:31.846 --> 01:13:33.274
Think it's a girth issue?

01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:35.518
Do you know what
your problem is?

01:13:35.553 --> 01:13:40.347
You have no concept of when
it is OK to tell a joke.

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:42.987
I mean, not even
in the slightest.

01:13:43.022 --> 01:13:44.857
But he's a meaningless.

01:13:44.892 --> 01:13:46.628
The entire concept
behind a fuck buddy

01:13:46.663 --> 01:13:47.761
is the utter lack of meaning.

01:13:47.796 --> 01:13:50.258
Fuck buddy-- it's just sex.

01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:51.600
Have you ever been one?

01:13:51.635 --> 01:13:52.997
A fuck buddy?

01:13:53.032 --> 01:13:53.668
I wish.

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:00.235
Personal effects.

01:14:04.813 --> 01:14:06.142
Maggie 2 was diabetic.

01:14:06.177 --> 01:14:07.880
How come she didn't
have any meds on her?

01:14:07.915 --> 01:14:11.554
Contents of her purse, contents
of her car, her pockets.

01:14:11.589 --> 01:14:13.556
No insulin, no testing kit.

01:14:13.591 --> 01:14:16.185
Maybe she shot up
before she left the house.

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.219
That's not how it works.

01:14:17.254 --> 01:14:18.561
I have a niece that's type 1.

01:14:18.596 --> 01:14:20.530
She tests her blood
sugar all the time.

01:14:20.565 --> 01:14:23.830
She carries around a
little testing kit.

01:14:23.865 --> 01:14:26.162
Where's Maggie 2's testing kit?

01:14:26.197 --> 01:14:28.461
Maybe Duane kept
it as a token.

01:14:28.496 --> 01:14:30.067
Maybe he did.

01:14:30.102 --> 01:14:31.640
But why didn't it turn up
when we searched his basement?

01:14:31.675 --> 01:14:34.137
Why didn't it turn up when
we searched his house?

01:14:34.172 --> 01:14:37.338
I literally have no idea
where you're going with this.

01:14:37.373 --> 01:14:38.746
It's just bothersome.

01:14:38.781 --> 01:14:40.308
Everything about these
two cases is bothersome.

01:14:40.343 --> 01:14:42.409
Except the part where we
have Duane's confession.

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:45.148
Right, but I want to know
why he killed Maggie 1.

01:14:45.183 --> 01:14:46.886
And don't tell me it
was to confuse the issue

01:14:46.921 --> 01:14:49.856
because that's really flimsy.

01:14:49.891 --> 01:14:50.725
And you know what?

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.485
Here's another thing.

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.828
She says if I want, she'll break
it off with the fuck buddy ex.

01:14:54.863 --> 01:14:57.226
What does that even mean?

01:14:57.261 --> 01:15:00.097
How much simpler
can she put it?

01:15:00.132 --> 01:15:03.001
I'm not sure how I'm
supposed to get over this.

01:15:03.036 --> 01:15:05.102
It's a serious infraction.

01:15:05.137 --> 01:15:06.367
You know what's a
serious infraction

01:15:06.402 --> 01:15:08.072
is running a red light.

01:15:08.107 --> 01:15:09.502
This is human behavior.

01:15:09.537 --> 01:15:12.208
You get over it because
Rita makes you happy.

01:15:12.243 --> 01:15:15.277
Do I look happy?

01:15:15.312 --> 01:15:15.948
I don't get it.

01:15:15.983 --> 01:15:16.850
Duane's dead.

01:15:16.885 --> 01:15:17.851
You have his confession.

01:15:17.886 --> 01:15:19.512
Why are we still doing this?

01:15:19.547 --> 01:15:22.086
We just need to follow up on
a few loose ends, Mr. Moore.

01:15:22.121 --> 01:15:23.120
The ME had found--

01:15:23.155 --> 01:15:24.517
Medical examiner.

01:15:24.552 --> 01:15:26.387
The medical examiner
had found some insulin

01:15:26.422 --> 01:15:27.256
in Maggie's blood--

01:15:27.291 --> 01:15:27.894
Yeah, Mags was diabetic.

01:15:27.929 --> 01:15:29.555
So what?

01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:32.866
Right, but what we didn't
find was any meds on her person

01:15:32.901 --> 01:15:34.065
or in her personal effects.

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:36.133
OK, that's actually
kind of strange.

01:15:36.168 --> 01:15:38.036
Maggie never left the
house without her kit.

01:15:38.071 --> 01:15:39.609
She was super careful.

01:15:39.644 --> 01:15:42.106
Her grandfather had
his foot amputated.

01:15:42.141 --> 01:15:43.140
Ow.

01:15:43.175 --> 01:15:44.812
Let me see if it's upstairs.

01:15:44.847 --> 01:15:45.615
Appreciate that.

01:15:48.851 --> 01:15:51.753
Andy, you know you
left the front door open.

01:15:51.788 --> 01:15:55.416
Oh, hi, officers.

01:15:55.451 --> 01:15:59.288
Isn't it great about Andy
not murdering his wife?

01:15:59.323 --> 01:15:59.959
Sure is.

01:15:59.994 --> 01:16:01.994
Yeah.

01:16:02.029 --> 01:16:03.831
Would you like a
drink or some pie?

01:16:03.866 --> 01:16:04.931
No, thank you.

01:16:04.966 --> 01:16:05.833
They're not staying, Cass.

01:16:05.868 --> 01:16:06.460
Thanks.

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:07.637
OK.

01:16:07.672 --> 01:16:09.397
The kit's not
here, but I know she

01:16:09.432 --> 01:16:10.640
had it because that
morning she went

01:16:10.675 --> 01:16:12.840
out to pick up new test strips.

01:16:12.875 --> 01:16:15.568
Maybe she left it by
accident, was paying,

01:16:15.603 --> 01:16:17.339
got distracted or whatever.

01:16:17.374 --> 01:16:19.605
Yeah, would you have
to know what pharmacy

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.650
Maggie might have used?

01:16:20.685 --> 01:16:23.576
Bucklin Pharmacy on Thompson.

01:16:23.611 --> 01:16:27.415
Yeah, and it had a monogram,
the kit, her initials, MLM.

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:28.790
Great.

01:16:28.825 --> 01:16:29.824
Well, thank you for
your time, Mr. Moore.

01:16:29.859 --> 01:16:31.859
Cassie, nice seeing you again.

01:16:31.894 --> 01:16:32.585
Bye.

01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:35.357
Let's go.

01:16:35.392 --> 01:16:37.766
Unexpected.

01:16:37.801 --> 01:16:39.295
Fuck buddies.

01:16:39.330 --> 01:16:40.461
JAY: I already
dealt with you guys.

01:16:40.496 --> 01:16:41.198
It's taken care of.

01:16:41.233 --> 01:16:42.133
It's done.

01:16:42.168 --> 01:16:42.936
Dealt with this how?

01:16:42.971 --> 01:16:44.300
Like four days ago.

01:16:44.335 --> 01:16:45.807
One of your cronies,
we worked it all out.

01:16:45.842 --> 01:16:47.336
Customer, Greg!

01:16:47.371 --> 01:16:49.338
No one from the
Castle corporate office

01:16:49.373 --> 01:16:50.713
was here four days ago.

01:16:50.748 --> 01:16:52.979
Don't fucking tell
me no one was here.

01:16:53.014 --> 01:16:55.718
Greg, customer!

01:16:55.753 --> 01:16:57.379
Jesus.

01:16:57.414 --> 01:17:01.724
Carlson, greasy
hair, bad breath.

01:17:01.759 --> 01:17:03.825
That's not our company card.

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:05.156
That's our company card.

01:17:08.524 --> 01:17:09.160
JAY: What?

01:17:12.066 --> 01:17:15.562
Clearly, you've been using
outside and, in many cases,

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:16.838
rancid product.

01:17:16.873 --> 01:17:18.202
Well, why would--

01:17:18.237 --> 01:17:20.633
Greg.

01:17:20.668 --> 01:17:22.107
Where the fuck are you?

01:17:31.679 --> 01:17:32.755
That little fucker.

01:17:37.685 --> 01:17:40.191
Hey, hey, Mr.
Connors, I'm so sorry

01:17:40.226 --> 01:17:41.764
about that misunderstanding.

01:17:41.799 --> 01:17:44.833
On the upside, not
all your customers

01:17:44.868 --> 01:17:46.593
have come down with E coli.

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:47.770
You know what?

01:17:47.805 --> 01:17:50.003
Mr. Connors, I
just lost my wife.

01:17:50.038 --> 01:17:51.840
You maybe read about
it in the papers.

01:17:51.875 --> 01:17:55.602
We are shutting you down
effective immediately.

01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:58.044
Do not touch that.

01:17:58.079 --> 01:18:02.015
And don't ignore
our lawyer's call.

01:18:02.050 --> 01:18:07.856
It would have a monogram
on it, MLM, Maggie Lee Moore.

01:18:07.891 --> 01:18:09.253
Even if she did
leave it, I don't

01:18:09.288 --> 01:18:10.859
see how it changes anything.

01:18:10.894 --> 01:18:13.554
It would just help to
explain one damn inconsistency.

01:18:13.589 --> 01:18:15.457
Sorry, nothing like that.

01:18:15.492 --> 01:18:16.623
If it turns up,
I'll let you know.

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:17.294
Thank you.

01:18:17.329 --> 01:18:18.900
Thank you, sir.

01:18:18.935 --> 01:18:21.133
Hey, I didn't
mean to eavesdrop,

01:18:21.168 --> 01:18:24.037
but I heard you were
talking about Maggie Moore.

01:18:24.072 --> 01:18:25.368
I'm not sure which one.

01:18:25.403 --> 01:18:27.535
I know they both passed,
like super bizarre.

01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:28.272
Maggie Lee Moore.

01:18:28.307 --> 01:18:29.075
Why?

01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:30.472
Did you help her?

01:18:30.507 --> 01:18:33.948
No, but the husband of
the first one who died--

01:18:33.983 --> 01:18:35.741
yeah, it was the
first one-- he was

01:18:35.776 --> 01:18:37.380
in here just making a purchase.

01:18:37.415 --> 01:18:38.788
So I asked if he
had a loyalty card,

01:18:38.823 --> 01:18:40.152
and he said he wasn't sure.

01:18:40.187 --> 01:18:41.989
So I looked it up in
the system, and that's

01:18:42.024 --> 01:18:43.991
when I saw that there
were two Maggie Moores.

01:18:44.026 --> 01:18:45.652
But for some reason,
the system had

01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:49.062
both Maggie Moore's under
the first one's phone number.

01:18:49.097 --> 01:18:51.262
So you're saying
that Maggie Moore's

01:18:51.297 --> 01:18:55.937
husband found out that there was
another Maggie Moore from you.

01:18:55.972 --> 01:19:00.172
Yes, that is what I'm saying.

01:19:00.207 --> 01:19:01.811
Freaky, right?

01:19:01.846 --> 01:19:04.341
Did he ever come back in
here after his wife was killed?

01:19:04.376 --> 01:19:06.816
Yeah, always bought
beer, always bought

01:19:06.851 --> 01:19:08.345
snacks and the prepaid phones.

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:09.676
Oh, and Mega Ball.

01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:10.820
Prepaid phones?

01:19:10.855 --> 01:19:13.680
Yeah, like two at a time.

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:14.923
I was going to
ask, like, what do

01:19:14.958 --> 01:19:16.452
you do with all
those phones, but he

01:19:16.487 --> 01:19:17.992
didn't really like to chitchat.

01:19:18.027 --> 01:19:23.195
Some people just don't,
you know, like to chitchat.

01:19:23.230 --> 01:19:24.834
Yeah, I've heard
that about some people.

01:19:30.501 --> 01:19:35.141
OK, well, Sammy, thank
you so much for your help.

01:19:35.176 --> 01:19:36.439
You have yourself
a very nice day.

01:19:36.474 --> 01:19:37.176
Thank you very much.

01:19:37.211 --> 01:19:37.847
You, too.

01:19:43.415 --> 01:19:45.811
Think Sammy and I are
wondering what Jay Moore

01:19:45.846 --> 01:19:47.615
is doing with all those phones.

01:19:47.650 --> 01:19:50.321
Yep.

01:19:50.356 --> 01:19:51.751
[knocking]

01:19:54.195 --> 01:19:56.525
He's not at home
or at the shop.

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.659
No.

01:19:58.694 --> 01:20:00.463
Uh-oh.

01:20:00.498 --> 01:20:03.565
I think I left
something in the car.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.974
Deputy.

01:20:06.009 --> 01:20:07.668
Are you avoiding me?

01:20:07.703 --> 01:20:08.669
Of course not.

01:20:08.704 --> 01:20:09.835
I'm here on police business.

01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:11.078
Bullshit.

01:20:11.113 --> 01:20:13.575
Can't you just get over this?

01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:15.379
I don't know if I can, Rita.

01:20:15.414 --> 01:20:18.217
Sorry, just being honest.

01:20:18.252 --> 01:20:22.386
He means nothing to
me, like zero, less than.

01:20:22.421 --> 01:20:25.191
It's not like me and
you were doing it.

01:20:25.226 --> 01:20:26.588
Did you tell him it was over?

01:20:26.623 --> 01:20:28.392
Did you end it with him,
like you said you would?

01:20:28.427 --> 01:20:29.756
That's not what I said.

01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:31.692
I said I would end it
if you wanted me to.

01:20:31.727 --> 01:20:34.035
Rita, come on.

01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:36.235
Don't you have any say
in your own life at all?

01:20:41.638 --> 01:20:43.803
It must be nice to see
everything so clearly.

01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:50.876
If you don't mind my saying--

01:20:50.911 --> 01:20:53.956
Can you just not?

01:20:53.991 --> 01:20:55.452
Thank you.

[upbeat music]

01:21:08.764 --> 01:21:11.534
Did you think you can
play me, motherfucker?

01:21:11.569 --> 01:21:13.041
[screaming]

01:21:13.076 --> 01:21:16.473
Where's my 600,
you little bitch?

01:21:16.508 --> 01:21:17.474
Where's my money?

01:21:24.417 --> 01:21:25.482
Oh, my God.

01:21:25.517 --> 01:21:27.286
Someone call 911!

01:21:27.321 --> 01:21:29.156
Get help!

01:21:29.191 --> 01:21:29.783
It's OK.

01:21:38.299 --> 01:21:40.134
Anonymous note
says it belonged

01:21:40.169 --> 01:21:42.334
to Jay Moore, who
anonymous says was,

01:21:42.369 --> 01:21:44.567
quote unquote,
"up to something."

01:21:44.602 --> 01:21:45.832
Huh.

01:21:45.867 --> 01:21:47.636
Did anonymous say
where they found this?

01:21:47.671 --> 01:21:50.771
No, but these texts
that we pulled off

01:21:50.806 --> 01:21:51.772
you're going to want to see.

01:21:55.514 --> 01:21:57.448
Anonymous note with
an anonymous phone

01:21:57.483 --> 01:21:58.812
and some anonymous texts.

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:00.121
Any fingerprints?

01:22:00.156 --> 01:22:02.618
Clean as a whistle.

01:22:02.653 --> 01:22:04.587
Don't speak in
cliches, please.

01:22:04.622 --> 01:22:05.819
It's very lazy.

01:22:05.854 --> 01:22:07.491
We traced the serial number.

01:22:07.526 --> 01:22:11.627
And guess which local drugstore
sold this particular phone?

01:22:11.662 --> 01:22:15.169
Bucklin Pharmacy on Thompson.

01:22:15.204 --> 01:22:18.469
Go pick up Jay, right?

01:22:18.504 --> 01:22:21.043
Not yet.

01:22:21.078 --> 01:22:24.508
I talked to one guy, one
fucking guy, and he's a Fed?

01:22:24.543 --> 01:22:26.444
You thought he was
12, Tommy T, so let's

01:22:26.479 --> 01:22:28.842
not blame it on a bad break.

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:29.843
Texts.

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:30.976
They're not mine.

01:22:31.011 --> 01:22:32.879
Are they Jay Moore's?

01:22:32.914 --> 01:22:34.881
Maybe.

01:22:34.916 --> 01:22:36.817
Maybe you guys can help me out.

01:22:36.852 --> 01:22:39.622
You know what they do
to guys like me in here?

01:22:39.657 --> 01:22:40.722
Pedophiles?

01:22:40.757 --> 01:22:42.460
Yeah.

01:22:42.495 --> 01:22:44.825
The pedophiles get castrated
usually with a rusty homemade

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:45.793
shiv of some kind.

01:22:45.828 --> 01:22:47.531
Well, you'll see.

01:22:47.566 --> 01:22:49.962
So you can let Duane Rich take
the fall for both Maggie Moore

01:22:49.997 --> 01:22:52.338
murders and stay in here and
get castrated with the rest

01:22:52.373 --> 01:22:54.901
of the pedophiles.

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:56.573
Or?

01:22:56.608 --> 01:22:58.905
Or what?

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.907
What, is there no fucking or?

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:04.317
Or maybe you know
more about these texts

01:23:04.352 --> 01:23:06.055
than you're letting on.

01:23:06.090 --> 01:23:08.156
Well, can you guys
get me out of here?

01:23:08.191 --> 01:23:11.720
You know, grant me at least
some kind of invulnerability?

01:23:11.755 --> 01:23:14.195
No, no, no, you're
a disgrace to society,

Tommy T, and a menace, too.

01:23:17.266 --> 01:23:20.069
We-- can talk to the DA.

01:23:20.104 --> 01:23:23.369
Maybe they'll knock a few
years off of what's going to be

01:23:23.404 --> 01:23:24.766
an extremely long sentence.

01:23:24.801 --> 01:23:26.966
Extremely long
sentence with no dick.

01:23:33.579 --> 01:23:34.281
What do you think?

01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:40.287
There's this tough guy.

01:23:40.322 --> 01:23:42.586
Well, you wanted
to tie up loose ends.

01:23:42.621 --> 01:23:45.523
Now all we've got is more
loose ends that need tying.

01:23:45.558 --> 01:23:47.129
I don't disagree.

01:23:47.164 --> 01:23:48.625
Except for the
fact that we actually

01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:49.923
have a confessed murderer.

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:51.430
I mean, that end is
tight as it gets.

01:23:51.465 --> 01:23:52.728
Nothing loose about it.

01:23:52.763 --> 01:23:54.301
So what do you propose we do?

01:23:54.336 --> 01:23:55.203
Who, me?

01:23:55.238 --> 01:23:56.105
You want my opinion?

01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:57.271
Yes, I want your opinion.

01:23:57.306 --> 01:23:59.064
You're a damn fine
police officer.

01:23:59.099 --> 01:24:00.703
Obviously, we've got to
check the deaf guy out.

I don't disagree.

01:24:12.255 --> 01:24:13.716

You have a squatter?

01:25:14.647 --> 01:25:15.778
Yep.

me in LA, told me

Nope, no sign of him.

SANDERS: What's going
on at Jay Moore's house?

01:29:21.597 --> 01:29:23.256
DISPATCH (ON RADIO): Clear,
except for the deceased.

01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:24.466
All right, I
need an all points

01:29:24.501 --> 01:29:27.293
on a 2008 Honda
Accord gold, license

01:29:27.328 --> 01:29:29.570
plate Frank George Henry 332.

01:29:29.605 --> 01:29:30.604
It's filthy dirty.

01:29:30.639 --> 01:29:31.935
She never washes the damn thing.

01:29:31.970 --> 01:29:33.574
DISPATCH (ON RADIO):
Copy that, chief.

01:29:33.609 --> 01:29:34.267
MICHAEL: Right turn.

01:29:39.747 --> 01:29:40.812
Left and second right.

01:29:40.847 --> 01:29:41.714
RITA: We're not
going to make it.

01:29:41.749 --> 01:29:42.715
MICHAEL: We'll make it.

01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:45.718
We're not going to make it.

01:29:45.753 --> 01:29:46.279
Oh!

[honking]

01:29:52.254 --> 01:29:54.793
SANDERS: 10-mile radius
from Moore's house.

01:29:54.828 --> 01:29:56.729
DISPATCH (ON RADIO):
Copy that, chief.

01:29:56.764 --> 01:29:57.356
MICHAEL: Right turn.

01:29:59.998 --> 01:30:01.734
RITA: It's a dead end.

01:30:01.769 --> 01:30:03.395
It's your lucky day.

01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:05.672
I'm letting you out here.

01:30:05.707 --> 01:30:06.673
No, you're not.

01:30:06.708 --> 01:30:08.004
You're going to kill me here.

01:30:08.039 --> 01:30:10.743
Just say it.

01:30:10.778 --> 01:30:13.174
Just fucking say it.

01:30:13.209 --> 01:30:14.912
I'm going to kill
you right here.

01:30:14.947 --> 01:30:17.013
[laughs]

01:30:17.048 --> 01:30:18.586
Not so bad, right?

01:30:18.621 --> 01:30:20.786
Almost peaceful, nobody
gets out of your control.

01:30:34.461 --> 01:30:36.868
[screaming]

[shattering]

01:30:50.213 --> 01:30:54.523
SANDERS: Someone once told him
it took courage to be happy.

01:30:54.558 --> 01:30:57.724
He didn't understand it then,
but he thinks he might now.

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:04.533
The problem, he realized,
is all the heartbreak.

01:31:04.568 --> 01:31:06.227
For some, it comes
more often than others,

01:31:06.262 --> 01:31:10.935
but he knew well it
comes for everyone.

01:31:14.776 --> 01:31:16.875
The irony was how the
heartbreak somehow

01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:22.980
made his own life
clearer, showed him

01:31:23.015 --> 01:31:25.620
a path to the happiness he'd
been so desperate to find.

01:31:29.725 --> 01:31:32.220
Obviously, not everyone
has that difficult a time.

01:31:32.255 --> 01:31:35.762
Some people are born
happy and stay happy.

01:31:35.797 --> 01:31:40.162
And to those people, he
thought, good for them.

01:31:40.197 --> 01:31:40.800
What a gift.

01:31:43.904 --> 01:31:48.071
For others, he knew,
it's just the opposite.

01:31:48.106 --> 01:31:53.241
They fight, losing battle
after losing battle,

01:31:53.276 --> 01:31:57.113
until, finally,
they lose the war.

01:31:57.148 --> 01:32:01.755
The rest, the majority even,
it's a constant struggle.

01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:05.451
Some days good, some
days not so good.

01:32:05.486 --> 01:32:07.728
They keep at it, though,
wake up each morning,

01:32:07.763 --> 01:32:10.599
hoping to catch lightning
in a bottle, which

01:32:10.634 --> 01:32:13.866
he knew was a cliche,
but also believed

01:32:13.901 --> 01:32:16.363
that's what happiness was.

01:32:16.398 --> 01:32:19.432
The sad thing was when he
realized too late that he

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:22.776
had once held the bottle.

01:32:22.811 --> 01:32:25.108
He held that bottle
right in his hands

01:32:25.143 --> 01:32:28.980
with a lightning
buzzing around inside.

01:32:29.015 --> 01:32:34.315
He was just too stupid or
too foolish or too proud

01:32:34.350 --> 01:32:39.320
to realize it, and he
let it get away from him.

01:32:39.355 --> 01:32:43.390
So was that another
heartbreak, or another part

01:32:43.425 --> 01:32:45.997
of the struggle?

01:32:46.032 --> 01:32:48.967
The truth is, he
didn't know yet.

01:32:52.269 --> 01:32:57.745
He just knew it would take
some courage to find out.

01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:00.781

[TERI NORTON - "HONEY MOON
HOUSE (BUILD A BUNGALOW)"]

01:36:48.835 --> 01:36:52.243
(SINGING) I told the
stars and the sky

01:36:52.278 --> 01:36:57.248
are blue, just the
way that I love you.

01:36:57.283 --> 01:37:02.187
This is what they set
to do, build a bungalow,

01:37:02.222 --> 01:37:04.726
build a honeymoon house for two.

01:37:07.788 --> 01:37:11.493
I talked to the tree,
the tall oak tree.

01:37:11.528 --> 01:37:14.694
Here's what the tall
tree said to me.

01:37:14.729 --> 01:37:19.908
My very best advice to
you, build a bungalow,

01:37:19.943 --> 01:37:22.603
build a honeymoon house for two.

01:37:25.641 --> 01:37:36.353
Birds and bees, rivers
and trees, skies are blue,

01:37:36.388 --> 01:37:39.961
say you love me, too.

01:37:39.996 --> 01:37:43.591
I saw two bluebirds
sitting in a tree.

01:37:43.626 --> 01:37:47.232
Here's what the
bluebird said to me.

01:37:47.267 --> 01:37:50.631
Build a nest like lovebirds do.

01:37:50.666 --> 01:37:54.569
Build a bungalow, build a
honeymoon house for two.

01:37:57.574 --> 01:38:01.081
I talked to the
river deep and wide.

01:38:01.116 --> 01:38:04.579
I told it how I feel inside.

01:38:04.614 --> 01:38:08.154
It told me just
what I should do.

01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:12.356
Build a bungalow, build a
honeymoon house for two.

01:38:16.197 --> 01:38:23.598
I believe the stars
that cover the sky.

01:38:23.633 --> 01:38:27.866
I believe in the moon up above.

01:38:30.508 --> 01:38:37.348
I believe God made
them for you and I

01:38:37.383 --> 01:38:43.684
to dream on as we fell in love.

01:38:43.719 --> 01:38:50.427
I believe in dreams
for dreams come true.

01:38:50.462 --> 01:38:53.859
I believe in dreams.

01:38:53.894 --> 01:38:56.928
Don't you?

01:38:56.963 --> 01:39:07.983
I believe your love for me is
true because I believe in you.
