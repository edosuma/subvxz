WEBVTT

00:08.138 --> 00:10.967
<i>Please join us on the lido deck</i>

00:11.011 --> 00:13.230
<i>for our biggest party</i>

00:13.274 --> 00:14.492
<i>Gatsby Night.</i>

00:14.536 --> 00:16.929
No, no, no, honey.
I'm just home alone.

00:16.973 --> 00:18.670
Carol was supposed to come by,

00:18.714 --> 00:20.455
but she hadn't even started
the reading for the book club.

00:20.498 --> 00:23.632
Big surprise.

00:23.675 --> 00:26.026
Uh, wh-- No. No, no.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.636
This is-- I was--
The TV...

00:27.679 --> 00:29.116
I-I'm just watching
a baking show.

00:29.159 --> 00:31.161
And they're-they're
making soufflés,

00:31.205 --> 00:33.120
and the judges just hate them.

00:33.163 --> 00:35.078
It was hilarious.
Listen, honey, I have to go.

00:35.122 --> 00:37.515
I love you,
and I'll talk to you soon.

00:37.559 --> 00:40.083
Attention, guests,
reservations are open

00:40.127 --> 00:41.998
for the Kids Club.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.044
Because we all could use...

00:45.175 --> 00:46.611
Hello?

00:47.917 --> 00:50.006
Can someone help me, please?

00:50.050 --> 00:53.183
I'd like to use the sauna.

01:05.021 --> 01:07.154
Is someone in there?

01:07.197 --> 01:09.765
I hope you don't mind sharing.
I'm coming in.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.069
It's called Bandium
and it's gonna revolutionize

01:53.113 --> 01:54.201
how we share information.

01:54.244 --> 01:56.638
The platform's API's
already integrated

01:56.681 --> 01:58.292
with the NCIS tip line.

01:58.335 --> 02:00.163
And I have set up
custom channels

02:00.207 --> 02:01.469
to organize each case.

02:01.512 --> 02:02.470
Come again?

02:02.513 --> 02:04.167
It's an app
for communicating.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.690
Oh, I wasn't aware
we had issues,

02:05.734 --> 02:07.475
- uh, communicating.
We don't.

02:07.518 --> 02:09.912
But Bandium will make
communicating better digitally.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.827
We'll be able to bounce ideas
off each other,

02:11.870 --> 02:14.308
anywhere, anytime,
all in a virtual space.

02:14.351 --> 02:16.571
Or we could just, you know...

02:16.614 --> 02:18.181
talk to each other.

02:20.923 --> 02:21.880
- Was this your idea?
No, no.

02:21.924 --> 02:23.186
Not my idea at all.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.492
But I'm telling you,
this couldn't hurt.

02:24.535 --> 02:25.754
I've read a lot of
good things about Bandium.

02:25.797 --> 02:26.885
I don't know, man.

02:26.929 --> 02:28.322
I got enough crap on my phone.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.933
All right, what the hell?
I will give it a shot.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.500
Now, that's the spirit.

02:32.543 --> 02:33.718
Okay, come on.

02:33.762 --> 02:36.330
Come on.

02:36.373 --> 02:38.332
That wasn't so bad, was it?

02:38.375 --> 02:40.943
Ah, our first Bandium.

02:40.986 --> 02:43.206
We got a body in a cruise ship.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.686
That docked at Norfolk.

02:44.729 --> 02:45.817
Look at that,
we're in business.

02:45.861 --> 02:46.905
Working already.

02:46.949 --> 02:48.646
I hate it when Parker's right.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.692
Get used to it.

02:51.780 --> 02:54.870
Victim here is Navy Commander
Roger Burrows.

02:54.913 --> 02:56.219
60 years old.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.525
He was a guest
on the cruise.

02:57.568 --> 02:58.700
- Who found him?
- Another guest.

02:58.743 --> 02:59.875
She was here for the sauna.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.398
Most of this place was empty,
though.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.226
The other passengers and crew
were on the other side

03:03.270 --> 03:04.401
of the ship
attending a party.

03:04.445 --> 03:05.881
Nothing like this
ever happens here.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.970
I mean, this is
a five-star cruise line.

03:08.013 --> 03:09.363
We pride ourselves on having

03:09.406 --> 03:10.929
the highest safety rating
in the business.

03:10.973 --> 03:11.930
Tell that to the dead guy.

03:11.974 --> 03:14.803
The sauna must have
malfunctioned.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.370
It's just a horrible,
tragic accident.

03:16.413 --> 03:17.371
Maybe.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.807
But I don't know too many people

03:18.850 --> 03:20.852
- who wear a tux to the sauna.
- No.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.941
But, uh, guests have been known
to drink

03:22.985 --> 03:24.595
and wander into the wrong cabin.

03:24.639 --> 03:25.857
All right, well,
we'll need to look at

03:25.901 --> 03:27.685
- the ship's surveillance footage.
- Of course.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.252
Of course, but, um...

03:29.296 --> 03:30.775
no cameras in the spa.

03:30.819 --> 03:32.690
You know, it's, uh,
guest privacy.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.257
You understand that.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.564
Looks like your five-star
security has a blind spot, then.

03:36.607 --> 03:38.479
Oh, there you are.

03:38.522 --> 03:40.437
Been wandering
all over this place.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.352
You know this thing has
ten decks,

03:42.396 --> 03:43.875
four swimming pools.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.790
I'd like to take Victoria
on a cruise, you know,

03:45.834 --> 03:47.488
but she gets so seasick.

03:47.531 --> 03:48.793
I know the feeling.

03:48.837 --> 03:50.926
Ah, not a big fan of boats,
either, Parker?

03:50.969 --> 03:53.711
- No.
- Well, that's not gonna be
a problem on this job.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.974
Let's see,
what do we have here?

03:56.018 --> 03:57.802
I've got second-degree burns
on at least his face

03:57.846 --> 03:59.456
and his hands.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.632
Signs of severe dehydration.

04:01.676 --> 04:04.635
This poor guy literally cooked
in there.

04:04.679 --> 04:05.897
So the sauna killed him.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.725
No, not-- not necessarily.

04:07.769 --> 04:08.813
No, you see, he's got

04:08.857 --> 04:10.815
these two stab wounds
in his neck.

04:10.859 --> 04:12.861
Likely severed
his carotid artery.

04:12.904 --> 04:13.949
Then where's all the blood?

04:13.992 --> 04:16.473
Uh, we have
some faint smear here.

04:16.517 --> 04:17.996
More streaks there.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.650
Looks like somebody tried
cleaning it up.

04:19.694 --> 04:22.610
So Burrows was stabbed before
he was stuffed in the sauna.

04:23.654 --> 04:24.699
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.440
Uh, stabbed?

04:26.483 --> 04:27.658
Are you saying
he was murdered?

04:27.702 --> 04:28.877
I need this ship locked down.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.314
No guest or crew member is
allowed on or off

04:31.358 --> 04:32.881
until they're cleared.

04:32.924 --> 04:34.622
But we're set to depart on
another trip tomorrow morning.

04:34.665 --> 04:36.319
Not anymore.
We'll need access
to Burrows' cabin.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.016
I also want to interview

04:38.060 --> 04:39.801
the guest who found the body.
What's her name?

04:39.844 --> 04:41.803
Um...

04:41.846 --> 04:43.544
Judy Price.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.763
Cabin 7024.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.722
Wait, did you just say
Judy Price?

04:48.897 --> 04:51.116
Mid-60s, white hair,
talks a lot?

04:51.160 --> 04:52.944
Um, yeah, yeah,
that's right.

04:52.988 --> 04:55.382
- Oh, boy.

05:01.126 --> 05:04.086
Tim. Hey.
Slow down, man.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.002
What's going on?

05:07.045 --> 05:08.525
Dude.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.745
Tim.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.094
Oh, thank God you're here.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.054
Okay, so you know each other.

05:16.098 --> 05:20.102
Nick, I want to introduce you
to Judy Price Fielding,

05:20.145 --> 05:21.756
my mother-in-law.

05:34.595 --> 05:37.380
Oh, it was awful.
It was just awful.

05:37.424 --> 05:40.470
Judy... Every time I close my eyes,
I-I see that

05:40.514 --> 05:42.951
burnt up face staring at me.

05:42.994 --> 05:44.779
Judy.

05:44.822 --> 05:46.041
Okay, I can't do this.

05:46.084 --> 05:47.564
There's just
too much negative energy.

05:47.608 --> 05:50.001
I've got to, like,
clear my mind, be here now.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.612
Judy.
Ah.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.440
Where are my chakra stones?

05:53.483 --> 05:54.832
- Judy. Judy.
- What?

05:54.876 --> 05:55.920
Sit down for me, okay?

05:55.964 --> 05:57.444
What are you doing here?

05:57.487 --> 05:59.489
The security officer told me

05:59.533 --> 06:01.622
to come back to my cabin
and wait.

06:01.665 --> 06:04.755
She said something to do with
contaminating the crime scene?

06:04.799 --> 06:07.105
No, no, no. I mean here,
as in on the cruise ship.

06:07.149 --> 06:09.499
Oh. I'm-I'm just vacationing,
of course.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.545
Okay, you realize you never
told me and Delilah

06:11.588 --> 06:12.807
that you were going
on a cruise, right?

06:12.850 --> 06:15.549
I didn't?
Could've sworn I did.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.769
Oh, I guess it slipped my mind.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.902
You know how we old people are.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.686
You talked to Delilah
on the phone last night.

06:22.730 --> 06:25.080
Told her you were at home
watching a baking show.

06:26.690 --> 06:30.738
Okay. I just didn't want Delilah
to know about this whole cruise.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.740
You know how she gets.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.437
No, I mean, I love my daughter.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.918
I love her to death,
but she can be

06:36.961 --> 06:39.921
just so overly protective.

06:39.964 --> 06:43.185
You know, she panics
the moment I'm out of range.

06:43.228 --> 06:44.882
But getting back to
our murder investigation,

06:44.926 --> 06:47.145
we do have some questions we
need to ask you, Mrs. Fielding.

06:47.189 --> 06:48.625
Oh, Judy.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.061
Please.
Everyone calls me Judy.

06:50.105 --> 06:52.716
Okay, Judy. Uh...

06:52.760 --> 06:57.721
The man you found in the sauna,
his name was Roger Burrows.

06:59.027 --> 07:00.768
Yes, they told me that
last night.

07:00.811 --> 07:02.073
Horrible.

07:02.117 --> 07:03.945
Had you seen him
on board at all?

07:03.988 --> 07:05.076
Maybe talked to him?

07:06.687 --> 07:10.212
Maybe once or twice, you know,
like, on the deck.

07:10.255 --> 07:12.083
Just a few hellos.

07:13.911 --> 07:16.000
So, is that it?
Am I done?

07:16.044 --> 07:18.655
Well, we're, uh, we're gonna
need a written statement first,

07:18.699 --> 07:21.876
but, uh, w-we should be able
to release you soon after that.

07:21.919 --> 07:24.052
Okay. This whole thing
of me being on a cruise,

07:24.095 --> 07:26.141
that could just stay
between us, right?

07:26.184 --> 07:28.839
Because there's no reason
to bother Delilah with it.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.493
Judy,

07:30.537 --> 07:32.016
you know I can't do that.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.757
Of course
I have to tell Delilah.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.237
Okay, okay.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.500
I'm just worried about
how she'll react.

07:37.544 --> 07:38.719
You think?

07:40.242 --> 07:42.505
No, of course I didn't know
about the cruise.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.246
I just found out
about it myself.

07:44.289 --> 07:47.684
I understand. I have no idea why
she didn't tell you, Delilah.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.991
Yes. Okay. Yes.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.514
Yes.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.951
Yes. Yes.

07:53.995 --> 07:56.214
No. Yes.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.694
Yes, okay.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.130
Bye.

08:00.175 --> 08:02.307
Delilah didn't take it well?

08:02.351 --> 08:05.049
Dude, 2,000 people on that ship,

08:05.093 --> 08:07.138
and Delilah's mother is
the one that finds the body.

08:07.182 --> 08:08.618
What's the beef between them?

08:08.662 --> 08:10.664
Well, you met Judy.
You know, she's...

08:10.707 --> 08:12.187
a very free spirit type.

08:12.230 --> 08:14.058
And Delilah's not down
with it?

08:14.102 --> 08:16.060
Well, it's not that, it's...

08:16.104 --> 08:18.236
Ever since Delilah's dad died,

08:18.280 --> 08:20.064
she feels like she's got to be
protective over Judy.

08:20.108 --> 08:22.327
Right? And sometimes
she goes a little overboard.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.852
Case of, uh,
helicopter daughtering.

08:24.895 --> 08:26.244
Hmm, mothering the mama.

08:26.288 --> 08:27.811
It's like last year,

08:27.855 --> 08:30.248
Judy wanted to go skydiving,
Delilah's freaking out.

08:30.292 --> 08:32.033
I try and intervene.

08:32.076 --> 08:33.600
End up sleeping on the couch.

08:33.643 --> 08:36.559
Well, then, for your sake,
I hope this case ends very soon.

08:36.603 --> 08:39.040
What's going on?
My Bandium's been silent.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.999
No one has anything to share?
Not one little post?

08:42.043 --> 08:43.044
I'm dealing
with my mother-in-law.

08:43.087 --> 08:44.088
And my app keeps crashing.

08:44.132 --> 08:46.569
And I'm just not into it.

08:46.613 --> 08:49.354
Guys, I'm telling you,
this Bandium is a game changer.

08:49.398 --> 08:52.314
Okay.

08:52.357 --> 08:53.837
Where are we with the case?

08:53.881 --> 08:55.796
Navy Commander Roger Burrows,

08:55.839 --> 08:57.275
60. No living family.

08:57.319 --> 08:58.886
He was on deployment
for three months.

08:58.929 --> 08:59.887
Returned two weeks ago.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.018
And he chose to spend

09:01.062 --> 09:02.280
his free time back on a ship?

09:02.324 --> 09:03.586
That's odd.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.283
You're gonna love
what I found in his cabin.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.764
Wireless spy cameras

09:07.808 --> 09:09.679
with night vision,
transmitters, bugs.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.942
Just a little extreme
for your average tourist.

09:11.986 --> 09:14.075
- Anything on the cameras?
- Don't know.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.643
Memory cards were removed,
so there's no way of knowing

09:16.686 --> 09:17.731
what he was using them for.

09:17.774 --> 09:19.123
I can take a guess.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.864
He was spying on the guests
in their rooms.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.213
A Peeping Tom?

09:22.257 --> 09:24.085
People hide cameras
in hotel rooms all the time.

09:24.128 --> 09:26.827
Then they turn around and sell
the footage on the dark web.

09:26.870 --> 09:29.612
Maybe somebody caught Burrows
peeping and killed him for it.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.222
That's a big maybe.

09:31.266 --> 09:32.789
Torres, Knight,
get back to the ship.

09:32.833 --> 09:35.052
Find someone
who actually talked to Burrows.

09:35.096 --> 09:37.751
And don't forget to post updates
on Bandium.

09:38.839 --> 09:39.840
<i>This is illegal.</i>

09:39.883 --> 09:40.884
You can't keep us here.

09:40.928 --> 09:41.972
- We're already underpaid.
- Christopher,

09:42.016 --> 09:43.800
take your pay up with corporate.

09:43.844 --> 09:46.150
I'm doing everything in my power
to get everyone released.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.499
Yeah. This sucks.

09:47.543 --> 09:50.633
I-I swear, this is the last time
I work for Zenith.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.243
Captain Finch?

09:52.287 --> 09:55.159
NCIS Special Agents
Knight, Torres.

09:55.203 --> 09:57.118
Looks like you've got a mutiny
- on your hands.
- Entertainers.

09:57.161 --> 09:59.120
It's always drama with them.

09:59.163 --> 10:01.078
They're complaining
about missing gigs on land.

10:01.122 --> 10:03.037
The ship lockdown is
getting to people, huh?

10:03.080 --> 10:04.821
And every minute it continues,

10:04.865 --> 10:06.997
the further behind we fall
on our turnaround schedule.

10:07.041 --> 10:10.348
So tell me,
how can I help you help me?

10:10.392 --> 10:11.872
We spoke to
your activities director.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.351
She said that you had dinner

10:13.395 --> 10:14.831
with Commander Burrows
two nights ago?

10:14.875 --> 10:16.354
Every evening,
we invite a few guests

10:16.398 --> 10:18.008
to have dinner
at the captain's table.

10:18.052 --> 10:20.358
Oh, it's like, uh,
like <i>The Love Boat.</i>

10:20.402 --> 10:22.143
<i>Capitán</i> Stubing.

10:23.535 --> 10:25.842
Yeah, I used to watch the show
in Spanish with my mom.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.801
Do you remember speaking
with Burrows?

10:27.844 --> 10:30.673
Yeah. Yeah, he stood out
from the crowd we usually get.

10:30.717 --> 10:31.848
How so?

10:31.892 --> 10:33.676
He was very curious
about the ship.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.069
He asked a lot of questions.

10:35.112 --> 10:36.766
What kind of questions?

10:36.810 --> 10:38.159
Mostly about security measures,

10:38.202 --> 10:39.900
restricted access,
our cameras.

10:39.943 --> 10:41.423
And you didn't find that as odd?

10:41.466 --> 10:43.773
He told me he'd done some
surveillance work in the Navy.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.253
Figured he was just curious.

10:47.429 --> 10:50.301
The burns,
comma, punctures...

10:50.345 --> 10:52.347
No, no, not "coma."
No, I-I said "comma."

10:52.390 --> 10:54.871
Okay, uh, um, uh, delete.

10:54.915 --> 10:57.221
No, d-don't type "delete."

10:57.265 --> 10:58.266
Deleting all.
- Oh. Agent Parker.

10:58.309 --> 10:59.876
I didn't see you there. Ha.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.878
I was just, uh, posting
an update to the Bandium app.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.010
How's that going for you?

11:03.053 --> 11:05.229
It's not great,

11:05.273 --> 11:06.883
uh, if I'm being honest.

11:06.927 --> 11:09.451
But not to worry,
I am game to make it work.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.235
Not, not "twerk."

11:11.279 --> 11:12.889
-"Twerk," definition:
- Um...

11:12.933 --> 11:13.934
sexually provocative danceOkay, forget it.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.239
with thrusting... Stop recording.

11:15.283 --> 11:16.371
Stop recording.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.199
Don't type "stop recording."
I...

11:18.242 --> 11:20.723
- Pause.
- Thank you.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.769
Got anything yet?
Time of death?

11:22.812 --> 11:24.379
Yeah. Well, it's tricky.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.424
Uh, TOD is
generally determined

11:26.468 --> 11:29.427
by a loss of body heat
postmortem, but...

11:29.471 --> 11:31.386
Burrows' body cooked
- in the sauna.
- Right.

11:31.429 --> 11:34.258
So our temperatures are pretty
much worthless, but, um...

11:34.302 --> 11:36.521
However, uh, Knight checked in
with the spa

11:36.565 --> 11:38.262
and was able to determine
a time line

11:38.306 --> 11:40.177
between when the last person
left the spa

11:40.221 --> 11:42.179
and when Mrs. Fielding
found the body.

11:42.223 --> 11:44.355
We're looking at
between 7:00 and 10:00 p.m.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.487
What about cause?

11:45.530 --> 11:47.750
That is where it gets
interesting.

11:47.794 --> 11:50.100
Uh, Burrows has two stab wounds

11:50.144 --> 11:51.493
on his carotid artery here.

11:51.536 --> 11:54.148
But the jabs are unusual.

11:54.191 --> 11:56.324
They're small,
exactly one inch apart

11:56.367 --> 11:57.542
and one inch deep.

11:57.586 --> 12:00.502
You know, just like, uh...

12:00.545 --> 12:02.112
Fangs?

12:04.593 --> 12:06.160
Doesn't feel right, Mom.

12:06.203 --> 12:08.162
After what you've been through,
you shouldn't be alone.

12:08.205 --> 12:09.772
Delilah, I told you, it's fine.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.208
Well, I would really feel better

12:11.252 --> 12:13.167
if you stayed with us tonight.

12:13.210 --> 12:15.299
And the twins would love
to see you.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.910
I see what you're doing there.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.476
I'll see the kids
this weekend, okay?

12:18.520 --> 12:22.132
I just-- really just want
to sleep in my own bed.

12:23.220 --> 12:26.093
Tim, don't you think
we should bring Mom home?

12:26.136 --> 12:27.964
I-I...

12:28.008 --> 12:29.139
Oh, Tim has a lot of work to do.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.488
We don't want to bother him.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.490
No. Tim wouldn't be bothered.
Would you, Tim?

12:32.534 --> 12:33.883
Well, to be honest with you...

12:33.927 --> 12:35.580
He's already driven us
all the way over here.

12:35.624 --> 12:36.930
Well, then he can drive
all the way back.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.235
I've got an idea.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.889
Judy, how about you stay
at the condo tonight

12:39.933 --> 12:42.805
and we will check in on her
first thing in the morning.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.589
I think that's
a terrific idea.

12:44.633 --> 12:45.808
Sweetheart,

12:45.852 --> 12:47.984
I will see you
tomorrow, then.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.334
A-And call me tonight
before you, you know, go to bed,

12:50.378 --> 12:52.162
or... Just so I know
you're okay, and... Oh, okay.

12:52.206 --> 12:54.208
- Okay.
- At least let us get you settled
inside.

12:54.251 --> 12:55.949
Oh, totally unnecessary.

12:55.992 --> 12:58.821
In fact,
the alarm company set me up

12:58.865 --> 13:00.170
with this really
nifty program

13:00.214 --> 13:01.389
that turns my alarm off for me.

13:01.432 --> 13:02.999
Look, see?

13:09.440 --> 13:10.441
Wha...

13:18.928 --> 13:20.843
Hey, Kasie.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.192
- Any news on the McGees?
- All fine.

13:22.236 --> 13:23.541
They went to the hospital
just to be safe.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.108
- The doctor cleared them.
- Thank God.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.502
That bomb took out most of
Judy's living room.

13:27.545 --> 13:28.546
How's she taking it?

13:28.590 --> 13:30.070
Remarkably well.

13:30.113 --> 13:32.202
Said it gave her
a reason to remodel.

13:32.246 --> 13:33.813
Okay.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.467
Well, that Mama Fielding is
one tough lady.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.948
Man, if somebody bombed
my place...

13:38.992 --> 13:41.168
Second thought, I hate my place.

13:41.211 --> 13:42.952
I wish somebody would bomb it.

13:42.996 --> 13:43.953
Uh, you find anything here?

13:43.997 --> 13:46.521
Just your standard IED.

13:46.564 --> 13:49.132
Parts could've come
from any local hardware store.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.917
Nothing that'll help
us ID the bomber.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.092
What set it off?

13:52.135 --> 13:53.528
It was wired to Judy's alarm.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.573
So when she used her app
to turn it off...

13:55.617 --> 13:57.880
Kaboom.
Mm-hmm.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.882
Knight said she talked
to the condo manager.

13:59.926 --> 14:04.147
The manager said he let some guy
into Judy's condo yesterday.

14:04.191 --> 14:06.976
The guy claimed to be
from the alarm company.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.456
So, Commander Burrows
is murdered,

14:08.499 --> 14:12.155
and then 24 hours later,
Judy's condo explodes.

14:12.199 --> 14:14.331
- Yeah. Can't be a coincidence.
- The question is

14:14.375 --> 14:16.116
why target Judy?

14:16.159 --> 14:18.858
I might have an answer for that,
but you're not gonna like it.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.599
I found a set of prints
in Burrows' cabin.

14:21.643 --> 14:24.951
- They weren't his.
- Whose were they?

14:28.998 --> 14:29.956
This should
be interesting.

14:29.999 --> 14:30.957
Tim.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.089
What am I doing in here?

14:33.133 --> 14:34.917
Well..

14:34.961 --> 14:38.878
Judy, you, uh, you haven't
been entirely truthful with us.

14:40.053 --> 14:41.924
Are you talking about
the cruise thing?

14:41.968 --> 14:43.447
- I said I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

14:43.491 --> 14:44.971
This is about
Commander Burrows.

14:45.014 --> 14:47.190
You told us you really
didn't know him.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.670
That's true.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.586
Okay, then why did we find
your print

14:51.629 --> 14:53.414
on a wine glass in his cabin?

14:53.457 --> 14:56.025
Well...

14:56.069 --> 14:58.027
it must've been
the housekeeper.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.377
She probably took a glass
from my cabin,

15:00.421 --> 15:01.639
and then she just put it
back in his

15:01.683 --> 15:03.250
without cleaning it properly.

15:03.293 --> 15:04.904
Really?

15:06.993 --> 15:08.516
Okay, okay.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.213
Okay.

15:10.257 --> 15:13.303
We... we met on the second day
of the cruise.

15:13.347 --> 15:14.957
We hit it off.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.916
We spent some time together.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.048
One thing led to another...

15:19.092 --> 15:21.050
Oh, oh, okay....and then he took me
back to his cabin

15:21.094 --> 15:23.226
- Oh, boy. Oh, okay.
- Then we...

15:23.270 --> 15:24.532
No, I'm good, I'm good.
- You know, we...

15:24.575 --> 15:25.925
were intimate with each other.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.578
No, no, no. I got-- I...

15:27.622 --> 15:29.102
Would it help the investigation
if I went into more detail?

15:29.145 --> 15:30.277
No, no, no.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.931
- No, it would not.
- Yeah, I'm out.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.193
That's it.

15:33.236 --> 15:34.237
I'm out.

15:34.281 --> 15:36.544
Judy.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.502
Why did you not tell us this
- before?
- It's personal.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.201
I don't understand
what's the big deal anyway.

15:41.244 --> 15:43.290
The big deal is that this is
a homicide investigation,

15:43.333 --> 15:45.074
and you knowing the victim is

15:45.118 --> 15:47.468
a very important piece of
information for us to have.

15:47.511 --> 15:50.253
Oh... I'm sorry.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.995
Well, you know, I just didn't
want Delilah to know about it

15:53.039 --> 15:55.128
and think I was being slutty.

15:55.171 --> 15:57.086
Judy, whatever issues you have
with Delilah,

15:57.130 --> 15:59.045
they're not important right now.

15:59.088 --> 16:02.004
Someone tried to kill you, and
we need to figure out why, okay?

16:02.048 --> 16:04.572
I just... I don't know
how I can help with this.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.443
Did Commander Burrows tell you
anything?

16:06.487 --> 16:08.619
Did, uh... did he say
anything that might explain

16:08.663 --> 16:10.099
what he was doing on the ship?

16:12.145 --> 16:14.103
I think he said something about
having a niece,

16:14.147 --> 16:16.453
and that she had passed away.

16:16.497 --> 16:19.152
Burrows didn't have
any next of kin.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.458
<i>Woman Burrows was talking about</i>

16:21.502 --> 16:23.069
was named Allison Howell.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.592
Daughter of an old
family friend.

16:24.635 --> 16:25.723
Was like a niece to him.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.160
Guess where Allison worked?

16:27.203 --> 16:29.684
- Zenith Cruise Line ship.
- She worked there

16:29.727 --> 16:31.599
as a waitress
until three months ago,

16:31.642 --> 16:33.122
when she fell
off the top deck

16:33.166 --> 16:35.124
- and died.
- Ship had another death?

16:35.168 --> 16:36.560
We talked to her attorney.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.519
Turns out the family tried suing
for wrongful death,

16:38.562 --> 16:40.173
but the coroner ruled it
an accident.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.001
- And it wasn't?
- Don't know.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.480
There was never
a real investigation.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.569
This happens a lot
on cruise ships.

16:45.613 --> 16:48.485
About 20 or so people die
or vanish each year,

16:48.529 --> 16:50.400
and there's never really
a follow-up.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.446
They just kind of sweep it
- under the rug.
- And let me guess.

16:52.489 --> 16:54.448
The cruise line is
never held accountable.

16:54.491 --> 16:57.494
All right, so if Allison died
suspiciously,

16:57.538 --> 17:00.062
maybe Burrows was on the ship
investigating her death.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.412
Maybe he found something
and that's what got him killed.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.240
Okay. But why target Judy?

17:04.284 --> 17:05.502
Killer could've seen them
together

17:05.546 --> 17:06.764
and think that
she knows something.

17:06.808 --> 17:08.505
All right, let's dig
into Allison's death.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.029
Find somebody on the ship
who knew her.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.117
In the meantime,

17:11.160 --> 17:12.770
Judy's life is still in danger.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.381
She needs protective custody.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.558
Good luck
with that, bro.

17:19.168 --> 17:21.257
Where do you want these?

17:21.301 --> 17:22.693
Oh, just follow me back here.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.260
Look, all I'm saying

17:24.304 --> 17:26.393
is that I wish
I could see the twins.

17:26.436 --> 17:28.482
Your life is in danger, Mom.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.701
Your condo exploded.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.268
The kids are with Tim's sister
until we know

17:32.312 --> 17:33.269
our place isn't next.

17:33.313 --> 17:34.531
I'm not convinced, though,

17:34.575 --> 17:37.230
that this was not a gas leak.

17:38.274 --> 17:40.102
Mm. This is for you.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.712
A gift?

17:41.756 --> 17:44.193
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

17:44.237 --> 17:46.456
Oh, honey, I love this.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.067
You have always had
the best taste.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.112
Thank you, Mom.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.505
It's got a hidden
panic button

17:51.548 --> 17:53.202
on the back that you push...

17:53.246 --> 17:55.074
Wait, wait.
- A hidden what? What, what?
- Panic button.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.466
You push it twice,

17:56.510 --> 17:57.728
and it immediately sends
a text alert to Tim and me

17:57.772 --> 18:01.123
with your GPS location... My location?

18:01.167 --> 18:02.298
Delilah,

18:02.342 --> 18:03.473
I'm in your house.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.084
Where am I gonna go?

18:06.433 --> 18:08.739
Hey, appreciate all the help,
Jimmy. Thanks, pal.

18:08.783 --> 18:10.306
Don't mention it.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.439
I have had my share
of in-law drama.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.181
Uh, anyway, I should, um...

18:15.224 --> 18:16.312
What? No, no.
You can't leave yet. No.

18:16.356 --> 18:17.313
What do you mean?
Where are you going?

18:17.357 --> 18:19.141
We-we got to hang out.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.100
Uh, that's okay.
No, I-I really got to get back.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.276
I'll get you a drink.
I'll get you a drink.

18:23.319 --> 18:24.668
We got a Fresca.
You want a Fresca?

18:24.712 --> 18:26.409
Fine, if it'll make you happy

18:26.453 --> 18:28.107
- I'll wear it.
Thank you.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.631
You're welcome.
- Be strong, my friend.

18:32.633 --> 18:35.592
Where on earth
did you get this rug?

18:35.636 --> 18:37.290
The shop on the corner of 7th.

18:37.333 --> 18:38.595
The one with all the antiques?

18:38.639 --> 18:40.423
- That place is horrendous.
What?

18:40.467 --> 18:41.685
Wait, why?

18:41.729 --> 18:43.600
Delilah, the owner tried
to rip me off.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.254
Well, he seemed nice enough
to me.

18:45.298 --> 18:46.821
No, he's a monster.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.519
I'm missing dinner service
on the ship.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.347
My manager is gonna kill me.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.349
We'll try not to keep you.

18:54.481 --> 18:57.614
How well did you know
Allison Howell?

18:57.658 --> 18:59.790
Uh, we were hired together
as assistant waitresses.

18:59.834 --> 19:02.315
Didn't know that
waitresses had assistants.

19:02.358 --> 19:03.838
They do on cruises.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.622
Someone's got to shuttle...

19:05.666 --> 19:06.884
[phones buzzing]thousands of...

19:08.190 --> 19:09.191
...plates to, um...

19:12.194 --> 19:14.544
I'm sorry,
that's really annoying.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.590
Maybe you should
take that or...

19:16.633 --> 19:18.461
No, no, it's, um...

19:19.549 --> 19:21.160
It's this new app.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.379
Yeah, we're still trying to get
the hang of it.

19:23.423 --> 19:26.643
Okay, sorry about that.

19:26.687 --> 19:27.818
Continue.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.864
Oh, I was just saying
my job sucks.

19:31.692 --> 19:33.302
People think it's glamorous
working on a cruise

19:33.346 --> 19:34.912
because you get to travel.

19:34.956 --> 19:37.306
But really we're
like glorified servants.

19:37.350 --> 19:39.352
- Did Allison feel the same way?
- Yeah.

19:40.614 --> 19:41.832
At first.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.791
And things changed?

19:43.834 --> 19:45.488
A month before she died, uh...

19:45.532 --> 19:47.490
Allison somehow had more money.

19:47.534 --> 19:50.189
Like a lot more
than the cruise pays.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.494
Any idea how she got
all that cash?

19:51.538 --> 19:52.713
She never told me.

19:52.756 --> 19:55.542
But there is one person
who might know.

19:55.585 --> 19:58.632
Allison used to disappear
for hours in-between shifts.

19:58.675 --> 20:00.503
I always thought
she was seeing a guy.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.636
- Do you know who?
- No.

20:02.679 --> 20:05.421
Relationships on board
are discouraged.

20:05.465 --> 20:07.728
But if you want to know
what happened to Allison,

20:07.771 --> 20:09.643
he'd be the one to ask.

20:11.384 --> 20:13.908
<i>You are being ridiculous.</i>

20:13.951 --> 20:15.214
<i>I don't think so.</i>

20:15.257 --> 20:17.259
Uh, Tim, can you weigh in
on this, please?

20:17.303 --> 20:19.740
Be happy, be calm.

20:19.783 --> 20:21.481
- Be centered.
- Tim!

20:21.524 --> 20:23.439
Be one with the uni... Yeah. Sorry.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.615
Can you please explain
to my mother

20:25.659 --> 20:29.358
why she can't throw a party
at our house right now?

20:29.402 --> 20:31.230
It's not a party.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.362
It's just a few friends
coming over for book club.

20:33.406 --> 20:34.581
You cannot have guests, Mom.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.365
You're under protective custody.

20:36.409 --> 20:37.888
Feels more
like prison to me.

20:37.932 --> 20:40.500
Tim, uh, can you please?
I can't.

20:40.543 --> 20:41.936
Judy, she's right, okay?

20:41.979 --> 20:43.807
We-- You got to take this
more seriously.

20:43.851 --> 20:45.244
I am.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.289
I'm wearing this little
panic button thingy,

20:47.333 --> 20:49.726
and I'm staying away from
the windows like Delilah wanted.

20:49.770 --> 20:51.685
And this whole thing
is very stressful.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.687
Look, I understand,
but you got to listen to her.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.297
Okay? We're trying
to protect you here.

20:55.341 --> 20:56.864
By locking me up?

20:56.907 --> 20:58.735
Oh, that's my food.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.389
You ordered food?

21:00.433 --> 21:01.477
Well, of course.

21:01.521 --> 21:02.522
You expect me to have guests

21:02.565 --> 21:03.740
and not serve them food?

21:03.784 --> 21:05.046
I wasn't raised in a barn.

21:05.786 --> 21:06.917
Hold on, I'll get it.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.702
I'm gonna go set up the table.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.617
You don't know
where anything is.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.445
Huh.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.012
Parker, hey.

21:15.056 --> 21:17.624
Thought I'd swing by,
see how you're holding up.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.713
I wasn't criticizing... Please, come on in.

21:23.456 --> 21:24.935
- Yeah.

21:24.979 --> 21:27.024
Well, you know,
things are, uh...

21:27.068 --> 21:28.983
Oh, you don't like
the way I cook dinner?

21:29.026 --> 21:30.332
Let's talk about
how you cook dinner.

21:30.376 --> 21:31.681
Not good.
Things are not good.

21:31.725 --> 21:34.771
Figured as much.
Not easy dealing with in-laws.

21:34.815 --> 21:35.946
You ever been married?

21:35.990 --> 21:38.079
Once.

21:39.689 --> 21:40.777
Didn't work out.

21:40.821 --> 21:42.475
I'm still trying
to figure out why.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.826
Got a delivery
for Judy Fielding.

21:47.088 --> 21:48.655
Yeah, send it on up.

21:48.698 --> 21:51.048
Judy ordered food.

21:51.092 --> 21:53.660
She's driving Delilah crazy,
which is driving me crazy,

21:53.703 --> 21:55.357
and I have no idea what to do.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.359
Look, whatever you're dealing
with, none of my business,

21:57.403 --> 22:00.493
but I come from a big family,
like <i>Brady Bunch</i> big.

22:00.536 --> 22:01.798
And one thing I know,

22:01.842 --> 22:04.366
you can't play Switzerland
forever.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.542
Hmm.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.677
Hey, you want to stay
for dinner, maybe?

22:10.720 --> 22:12.331
Could use the backup.

22:12.374 --> 22:13.332
I could eat.

22:21.862 --> 22:23.472
Hey. Oh. You know what?

22:23.516 --> 22:25.039
Hold on one second,
let me get you a tip.

22:30.740 --> 22:31.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:32.002 --> 22:33.613
Down, down!
On the ground, now!
Oh, oh.

22:33.656 --> 22:34.831
- Get down, get down.

22:34.875 --> 22:36.006
- Don't shoot!
- On the ground!

22:36.050 --> 22:37.747
- Don't shoot!
- Hands! Let's see some hands!

22:37.791 --> 22:39.706
Hands!
Don't shoot.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.360
I just want to talk to her.

22:41.403 --> 22:42.796
Harold?

22:42.839 --> 22:44.711
Judy, you know this guy?

22:44.754 --> 22:47.757
Know me? We were engaged.

22:58.812 --> 23:00.422
You have a fiancé?

23:00.466 --> 23:02.685
Well, technically, ex-fiancé.

23:02.729 --> 23:04.121
We broke up a month ago.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.558
We? You're the one
that wanted "space."

23:05.601 --> 23:07.516
Quiet. We'll get to you
in a minute.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.518
Judy, how long were you engaged?

23:09.562 --> 23:10.911
About six months.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.521
- Ah. Oh, my God.
- Okay, were...

23:12.565 --> 23:13.609
were you planning
on telling us

23:13.653 --> 23:14.697
any of this at any point?

23:14.741 --> 23:15.959
I was,
but then we broke up,

23:16.003 --> 23:17.874
so I figured what's the point?

23:17.918 --> 23:19.615
"What is the point?"
What's the point?

23:19.659 --> 23:21.400
The point, Mom,
I am your daughter.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.097
Don't you think you should've
shared that with us?

23:23.140 --> 23:24.490
Okay, lover boy.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.056
Your turn.
If you two broke up,

23:26.100 --> 23:27.623
what are you doing here?

23:27.667 --> 23:30.017
I'm-I'm trying to
patch things up.

23:30.060 --> 23:33.107
I heard from Judy's neighbor
that she was staying here.

23:33.150 --> 23:34.717
But when I saw
all the security outside,

23:34.761 --> 23:36.719
I didn't think
I couldn't get in.

23:36.763 --> 23:41.115
I was gonna leave,
but then I saw the delivery guy.

23:41.158 --> 23:44.161
So, you borrowed the delivery
guy's jacket to sneak in here?

23:44.205 --> 23:45.554
You almost got shot.

23:45.598 --> 23:47.991
Would've been worth it
just to see her again.

23:48.035 --> 23:49.428
Harold. It's over.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.734
Please,
give me one more chance.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.997
I'm so sorry,

23:54.041 --> 23:58.480
but I met someone else
on the cruise.

23:58.524 --> 24:01.440
Granted, he was murdered,
but still, I've moved on.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.790
Fine.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.095
Then I want the bag back.

24:05.139 --> 24:07.141
You gave me that as a gift.

24:07.184 --> 24:09.012
Yeah, a very
expensive gift.

24:09.056 --> 24:11.450
Now that you've dumped me...

24:11.493 --> 24:13.495
do you know how much I could get
for that on eBay?

24:13.539 --> 24:14.540
- Mom, why don't yougive him

24:14.583 --> 24:15.845
the bag back so we can just

24:15.889 --> 24:17.064
end this night already?

24:17.107 --> 24:18.457
All right. All right.

24:25.725 --> 24:27.466
What is that?

24:27.509 --> 24:28.858
I don't know.
I've never seen it before.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.688
Judy, that bag ever been
out of your possession?

24:32.732 --> 24:34.168
No, uh...

24:34.211 --> 24:36.518
Well, except for when I went
to the bathroom, but...

24:36.562 --> 24:39.913
Which I did in Roger's cabin.

24:39.956 --> 24:42.481
Do you think that he put that
in there, my bag?

24:48.704 --> 24:49.966
A playing card?

24:50.010 --> 24:51.968
The Joker, to be specific.

24:52.012 --> 24:54.144
And we're sure Commander Burrows
put it there.

24:54.188 --> 24:56.103
We ran the writing
on the envelope

24:56.146 --> 24:57.887
against a handwriting sample
of his.

24:57.931 --> 24:59.541
It was a direct match.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.543
- So, what does the card mean?
- Don't know yet.

25:01.587 --> 25:03.545
- Kasie is still analyzing.
- But we're thinking

25:03.589 --> 25:05.547
that Burrows was running
his own investigation.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.157
He was looking into
the death of a family friend,

25:07.201 --> 25:08.898
and he might've found something
and left the clue

25:08.942 --> 25:10.160
with Judy for safekeeping.

25:10.204 --> 25:11.553
But why Judy?

25:11.597 --> 25:12.728
She told him that
her son-in-law worked

25:12.772 --> 25:14.687
for NCIS.
Maybe Burrows thought that

25:14.730 --> 25:16.558
if something happened
to him, we'd be able to

25:16.602 --> 25:17.820
finish what he started.

25:17.864 --> 25:19.561
So, all this is connected

25:19.605 --> 25:21.563
to Allison Howell's death
three months ago?

25:21.607 --> 25:23.783
Jimmy looked into
her autopsy report.

25:23.826 --> 25:26.133
She fell from a top balcony
and broke her neck.

25:26.176 --> 25:28.831
But amongst the bones that
she broke was her hyoid bone.

25:28.875 --> 25:32.269
Which is most commonly broken
in victims of strangulation.

25:32.313 --> 25:34.707
So, the accident was staged.

25:34.750 --> 25:35.751
Any idea who staged it?

25:35.795 --> 25:37.057
Her boyfriend
might be involved.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.798
We haven't IDed him yet,
but we're working on it.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.843
Well, work faster.

25:40.887 --> 25:43.063
My phone's been ringing
off the hook all morning.

25:43.106 --> 25:45.195
Turns out the CEO
of Zenith Cruise Line

25:45.239 --> 25:46.762
has some very powerful friends.

25:46.806 --> 25:47.763
Let me guess,

25:47.807 --> 25:49.896
he wants the ship released.

25:49.939 --> 25:51.245
Every day it's docked
is costing him a fortune.

25:51.288 --> 25:52.812
If he doesn't like it,
tell him people should

25:52.855 --> 25:54.553
stop dying on his boat.

25:54.596 --> 25:55.902
I'll give him the message.

25:55.945 --> 25:58.034
Until then, the sooner
we close this, the better.

25:58.078 --> 26:00.167
I can hold him off,
but I don't know how long.

26:04.606 --> 26:05.781
Mmm.

26:09.219 --> 26:11.221
Good pancakes, Judy.

26:11.265 --> 26:12.919
Amazing.

26:14.660 --> 26:17.097
Chocolate chips, awesome.

26:18.925 --> 26:20.666
Super fluffy, too.
I don't know how you do that.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.319
How do you make them
super fluffy like that?

26:22.363 --> 26:23.930
Careful, Tim.

26:23.973 --> 26:26.759
You're asking Mom to reveal
another one of her secrets.

26:28.064 --> 26:29.718
This is ridiculous.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.894
Tim, don't you have
another place

26:31.938 --> 26:34.723
where I can go
and be in protective custody?

26:34.767 --> 26:36.246
I really don't
feel safe here.

26:36.290 --> 26:38.727
Oh, now you care
about being safe?

26:38.771 --> 26:40.207
Will you stop being
so overdramatic?

26:40.250 --> 26:42.818
Oh, my God. Enough. Guys.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.124
Seriously.

26:44.167 --> 26:47.693
Listen to me right now.
Delilah, I love you.

26:47.736 --> 26:49.912
But you've got to give
your mother some space.

26:49.956 --> 26:50.957
I know that

26:51.000 --> 26:52.262
you are being
protective over her,

26:52.306 --> 26:53.655
but she is a grown woman.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.614
She can take care
of herself.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.093
Tim,
what are you talking about?

26:57.137 --> 26:58.921
Her life is in danger.

26:58.965 --> 27:00.923
I'm not talking about
the current situation.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.882
Delilah,
ever since your father died,

27:02.925 --> 27:05.188
you've been a little too
overprotective over your mother.

27:05.232 --> 27:06.712
That's not true.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.278
Really? How about when
you went through her emails?

27:08.322 --> 27:09.671
Wha...

27:09.715 --> 27:11.238
You did that?

27:11.281 --> 27:13.196
Uh...

27:13.240 --> 27:15.634
Do you know how many scams
target senior citizens?

27:15.677 --> 27:17.070
I was looking out
for her.
Oh, God.

27:17.113 --> 27:18.724
But it was an invasion
of her privacy.

27:18.767 --> 27:22.858
Thank you, Tim.
She is way too overprotective.

27:22.902 --> 27:24.860
Judy, I'm not
done here. Listen.

27:24.904 --> 27:27.254
You need to stop hiding things
from Delilah.

27:27.297 --> 27:28.647
She's your daughter.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.431
She just wants to be
a part of your life.

27:31.998 --> 27:33.042
Please don't shut her out.

27:33.086 --> 27:34.827
- I don't shut her out.
- Really?

27:36.002 --> 27:37.394
Okay, maybe a little.

27:37.438 --> 27:38.657
Here's the deal.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.136
You two need to learn

27:40.180 --> 27:41.834
how to communicate
with each other

27:41.877 --> 27:43.879
without me being involved, okay?

27:43.923 --> 27:45.794
So neither of you are
gonna leave this table

27:45.838 --> 27:49.189
until you are done listening
to what the other has to say.

27:49.232 --> 27:52.061
Okay?

27:52.105 --> 27:53.759
All right.

28:02.811 --> 28:05.074
- Nick?
- Yeah.

28:05.118 --> 28:06.728
Is this a cry for help?

28:06.772 --> 28:08.164
I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:09.209 --> 28:10.732
Your Bandium post?

28:12.865 --> 28:14.431
"You know what I think
Parker should do with his app?

28:14.475 --> 28:15.694
He can..."

28:15.737 --> 28:17.391
And I won't read
the rest out loud

28:17.434 --> 28:18.827
because I am a lady.

28:18.871 --> 28:20.263
I'm just venting.

28:20.307 --> 28:22.091
Then why is it a public post?

28:23.092 --> 28:24.050
What?

28:24.093 --> 28:26.356
Everyone can see this.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.315
Including Parker.

28:29.403 --> 28:32.275
See? This is why
I hate these apps.

28:32.319 --> 28:35.017
Okay. Delete.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.758
All right, there.
Boom, gone.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.194
All good.

28:38.238 --> 28:40.893
Unless Parker read it
before you deleted it.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.155
Oh, well, he's a big boy.

28:42.198 --> 28:43.373
I'm pretty sure
he can handle it.

28:43.417 --> 28:46.768
He is technically
your boss, though.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.901
I mean, if it were me,
I'd still talk to Parker

28:48.944 --> 28:50.380
and just explain it.

28:50.424 --> 28:52.382
Explain what?

28:52.426 --> 28:54.863
That we have an
update on IDing

28:54.907 --> 28:56.212
Allison Howell's boyfriend.

28:56.256 --> 28:57.823
Oh? What's the update?

28:57.866 --> 28:59.955
We can't ID him.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.740
I mean,

29:01.783 --> 29:03.045
not yet, at least.

29:03.089 --> 29:05.047
I have looked through her emails

29:05.091 --> 29:06.745
and her hard drives,
and so far, nothing.

29:06.788 --> 29:07.833
And I talked
to the rest

29:07.876 --> 29:09.486
of her coworkers on the ship.

29:09.530 --> 29:10.836
Dead end.

29:10.879 --> 29:12.228
Well, maybe not for long.

29:12.272 --> 29:14.230
McGee,
what are you doing here?

29:14.274 --> 29:15.754
Yeah.
Shouldn't you be at home

29:15.797 --> 29:17.407
in case more of Judy's exes
stop by?

29:17.451 --> 29:18.887
Well, I got two extra
agents there.

29:18.931 --> 29:20.019
Should be okay.

29:20.062 --> 29:22.151
So, anyway,
I was at home,

29:22.195 --> 29:24.414
uploading information
to the Bandium app, right?

29:24.458 --> 29:25.764
Got to thinking,

29:25.807 --> 29:26.982
what if the staff
on the ship had

29:27.026 --> 29:28.810
their own version
of a Bandium-like app?

29:28.854 --> 29:30.507
A way for them to communicate
with each other?

29:30.551 --> 29:32.248
You had me at Bandium.

29:32.292 --> 29:33.336
Talked to Allison's coworker.

29:33.380 --> 29:35.425
Turns out the staff
has their own

29:35.469 --> 29:37.079
version of an online
message board.

29:37.123 --> 29:38.124
Look what I found.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.823
"Miss you. Meet you
at the same place. CB."

29:41.867 --> 29:43.477
Could be Allison's boyfriend.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.479
Check his initials
- with the staff directory.
Done.

29:45.522 --> 29:48.438
C.B. could stand
for Christopher Blaze.

29:48.482 --> 29:50.397
He's listed as an entertainer
aboard the ship.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.181
I saw this guy talking
to the captain.

29:52.225 --> 29:54.183
He seemed in quite a hurry
to get off that ship.

29:54.227 --> 29:55.532
Oh, I just found something.

29:55.576 --> 29:58.187
Looking at Christopher Blaze's
website right now.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.059
Turns out, he is not just
an entertainer,

30:00.102 --> 30:01.408
he is a magician.

30:01.451 --> 30:03.932
And guess what his specialty is?

30:05.325 --> 30:07.022
Card tricks.

30:07.066 --> 30:08.981
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

30:09.024 --> 30:10.852
- We have a magic
trick for you.

30:11.897 --> 30:12.941
Voilà.

30:12.985 --> 30:14.551
Is this your card?

30:14.595 --> 30:16.466
Yeah, I use that brand.

30:16.510 --> 30:17.990
So what?

30:18.033 --> 30:19.948
So, can you explain
what it was doing

30:19.992 --> 30:21.384
in the possession
of Commander Burrows?

30:21.428 --> 30:22.951
I don't know.

30:22.995 --> 30:25.301
Maybe he came to my show,
and I did a trick for him.

30:25.345 --> 30:26.868
Kept the card
as a souvenir.

30:26.912 --> 30:29.088
Do you know how many shows I do
on that boat?

30:29.131 --> 30:32.134
Okay, Houdini.

30:32.178 --> 30:34.049
You remember her?

30:34.093 --> 30:37.270
Yeah. Waitress.
She used to work on the ship.

30:37.313 --> 30:39.446
- How well did you know her?
- Not very well.

30:39.489 --> 30:41.013
Well, that's interesting,
considering the love notes

30:41.056 --> 30:42.884
we found on the ship
message board.

30:42.928 --> 30:46.235
We also found 50,000
in cash in your cabin.

30:46.279 --> 30:49.456
Allison had a lot of cash
on her when she died.

30:49.499 --> 30:50.849
Where'd you get it?

30:50.892 --> 30:52.285
Tips.

30:52.328 --> 30:53.547
No, uh, we saw
your act online.

30:53.590 --> 30:55.114
You're not that good.

30:55.157 --> 30:57.333
You probably got that money
from selling drugs.

30:57.377 --> 30:58.857
We looked into
your record.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.859
Your real record.

31:00.902 --> 31:03.252
Christopher Blaze is
just a stage name.

31:03.296 --> 31:05.385
Your real name is
Chris Branzato,

31:05.428 --> 31:07.430
and you have a rap sheet
a mile long

31:07.474 --> 31:09.171
- for drug trafficking.
- And what happened?

31:09.215 --> 31:11.521
Allison find out where the
money was really coming from?

31:11.565 --> 31:13.567
She threatened to expose you
and you killed her.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.482
And then later,
you killed Burrows

31:15.525 --> 31:17.179
when he came around
asking questions.

31:17.223 --> 31:19.181
No, no. I didn't kill anyone.

31:19.225 --> 31:20.226
Got any, uh,
tricks up your sleeve,

31:20.269 --> 31:21.880
now would be
a good time to use them.

31:24.056 --> 31:25.579
Okay, yes.

31:25.622 --> 31:26.928
I was selling drugs.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.495
With Allison.

31:28.538 --> 31:30.236
We were partners.

31:30.279 --> 31:33.108
We sold mostly harmless stuff,

31:33.152 --> 31:34.893
like ED meds.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.547
The older guests pop 'em
like Tic Tacs.

31:37.591 --> 31:39.027
But the night Allison died,

31:39.071 --> 31:40.942
she said she was going down
to the engine room.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.335
Why the engine room?

31:42.378 --> 31:43.945
It's where we kept our stash.

31:43.989 --> 31:46.034
She went down there,
but never came back.

31:46.078 --> 31:48.689
I swear I didn't kill Allison
or Burrows.

31:49.951 --> 31:52.171
In fact, I can prove it.

31:52.214 --> 31:53.215
I have an alibi.

31:53.259 --> 31:55.391
Not for Burrows' death,
you don't.

31:55.435 --> 31:57.045
No. We, uh, we checked.

31:57.089 --> 31:59.134
You weren't scheduled to perform
that night.

31:59.178 --> 32:03.312
Yeah, but the guy who was
scheduled got food poisoning,

32:03.356 --> 32:05.575
and I filled in
at the last minute.

32:05.619 --> 32:08.013
I performed in front of
500 people.

32:09.231 --> 32:12.974
That's 500 witnesses
who can vouch for me.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.934
How's that for
a magic trick?

32:15.977 --> 32:18.545
I just made your case disappear.

32:18.588 --> 32:20.939
God, I hate magicians.

32:20.982 --> 32:22.418
Where's the playing card?

32:23.332 --> 32:25.204
Has anyone taken it
out of the evidence bag?

32:25.247 --> 32:26.248
Kasie, relax, relax.

32:26.292 --> 32:27.467
It's still sealed and safe.

32:27.510 --> 32:28.555
What's going on?

32:28.598 --> 32:29.948
I finished analyzing the stains

32:29.991 --> 32:31.036
I found on the card.

32:31.079 --> 32:33.386
Turns out
the card wasn't the clue.

32:33.429 --> 32:35.431
It's what was on the card
that's important.

32:35.475 --> 32:36.519
What was on it?

32:36.563 --> 32:38.434
Trace elements
of hazardous waste.

32:38.478 --> 32:41.089
We're talking
seriously toxic stuff.

32:41.133 --> 32:44.527
What is toxic waste doing
on a cruise ship with seniors?

32:54.146 --> 32:57.105
The toxic waste I found
is called EAFD,

32:57.149 --> 32:59.412
or electric arc furnace dust.

32:59.455 --> 33:01.588
It's a by-product
of steel production

33:01.631 --> 33:04.808
and contains hazardous elements
like lead and chromium.

33:04.852 --> 33:06.375
In other words,
stuff you wouldn't normally find

33:06.419 --> 33:08.029
on a cruise ship.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.770
Definitely not on the lido deck.

33:09.813 --> 33:14.079
This stuff is highly toxic
and very hard to dispose of.

33:14.122 --> 33:16.342
Unless, of course, you're
in the middle of the ocean

33:16.385 --> 33:17.734
with no one watching.

33:17.778 --> 33:18.822
You think someone
on the ship

33:18.866 --> 33:20.346
- was dumping it?
- Possibly.

33:20.389 --> 33:23.175
A lot of industrial companies
would pay good money

33:23.218 --> 33:25.829
to find an easy way
to dispose of this stuff.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.962
So the ship was dumping
toxic waste.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.486
Commander Burrows comes along,
discovers it, and then what?

33:30.530 --> 33:32.010
Puts it on a playing card?

33:32.053 --> 33:34.142
Must've used whatever he had
to collect a sample.

33:34.186 --> 33:35.578
Before he could tell anyone,
he was killed.

33:35.622 --> 33:38.190
So whoever was doing the dumping
could be our killer.

33:38.233 --> 33:39.191
If you want to
find this guy,

33:39.234 --> 33:41.367
your best bet is to figure out

33:41.410 --> 33:43.238
how he got the waste aboard
in the first place.

33:43.282 --> 33:44.848
Parker.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.285
You're kidding me.

33:47.286 --> 33:49.070
Yeah, but can't you just...

33:49.114 --> 33:51.377
Be-- No.

33:51.420 --> 33:53.031
No, no, I get it.

33:53.074 --> 33:54.554
Okay, we got a problem.

33:54.597 --> 33:57.035
The CEO of the cruise line
finally got the Coast Guard

33:57.078 --> 33:58.949
to release the ship.
They're leaving in three hours.

33:58.993 --> 34:00.560
It's a crime scene.
He can't do that.

34:00.603 --> 34:02.388
There's got to be
- some way we can fight this.
- We tried.

34:02.431 --> 34:04.042
But by that time,
the ship will be long gone

34:04.085 --> 34:05.347
in international waters.

34:05.391 --> 34:07.306
And so could our killer.

34:07.349 --> 34:09.264
Yes, I need
inspection reports

34:09.308 --> 34:11.353
for everything
that left port that day.

34:11.397 --> 34:13.355
Come on, Jonesy.
I'm just asking for you

34:13.399 --> 34:16.097
and your Coast Guard buddies
to stall the ship a little.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.099
You know, block it
with a tugboat or something.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.449
Took long enough, but I got
the dock surveillance footage.

34:20.493 --> 34:22.625
Great. Well, take some of
these cargo manifests,

34:22.669 --> 34:24.192
'cause I don't even know
what I'm reading anymore.

34:24.236 --> 34:25.889
Thanks, I owe you one.

34:25.933 --> 34:27.195
All right, I think
I bought us some time.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.501
- How we doing?
- Not good.

34:28.544 --> 34:30.198
The day the ship departed,

34:30.242 --> 34:33.114
there were hundreds of supplies
that were loaded on board.

34:33.158 --> 34:35.334
They could've smuggled it in
anywhere.

34:35.377 --> 34:38.337
We're talking about toxic waste
here, not cigarette cartons.

34:38.380 --> 34:39.947
Focus on large pallets.

34:40.948 --> 34:41.905
Hey.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.255
What are you doing here?

34:43.298 --> 34:44.473
We were going a little
stir-crazy at the house,

34:44.517 --> 34:45.605
so I figured we'd visit.

34:45.648 --> 34:47.346
Although, I don't know.

34:47.389 --> 34:49.522
Th-this might
not be a good time.

34:49.565 --> 34:50.914
Oh, well, yeah.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.133
We're kind of
in the middle of something.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.395
We're in a bit of
a time crunch here.

34:53.439 --> 34:54.570
Got a lead?
Maybe we could help.

34:54.614 --> 34:56.572
Uh, if you're offering,
we'll take it.

34:56.616 --> 34:58.618
Grab a manifest
and look through 'em.

34:58.661 --> 35:00.576
- What are we looking for?
- Inconsistencies.

35:00.620 --> 35:03.188
Anything that doesn't belong
on a pleasure cruise.

35:05.625 --> 35:06.930
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Yeah.

35:06.974 --> 35:08.018
Everything okay?

35:08.062 --> 35:10.456
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

35:11.979 --> 35:13.415
I'm-I'm not gonna lie,
what you said hurt,

35:13.459 --> 35:16.418
but it got Mom and me
to open up.

35:16.462 --> 35:18.159
It felt like,
for the first time,

35:18.203 --> 35:20.640
we actually listened
to each other.

35:20.683 --> 35:22.990
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.600
That's great, that's great.

35:24.644 --> 35:27.212
Yeah. Thank you for telling me
what I needed to hear.

35:35.263 --> 35:36.525
Huh.

35:36.569 --> 35:38.484
What-what-what is that program?

35:38.527 --> 35:39.702
It's not a program.

35:39.746 --> 35:41.356
That's surveillance,
uh, footage

35:41.400 --> 35:42.444
from the docks,
that's everything

35:42.488 --> 35:44.098
that was loaded on the ship.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.623
Well, in that case it is wrong,

35:47.667 --> 35:50.191
because that
was not on the ship.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.540
McDougal's Ginger Ale?

35:51.584 --> 35:53.368
They didn't have ginger ale?

35:53.412 --> 35:54.456
No, no,
they had ginger ale.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.718
They just didn't have
McDougal's.

35:55.762 --> 35:57.981
- Are you sure, Mom?
- Oh, yes, I'm sure.

35:58.025 --> 35:59.374
McDougal's is my favorite.

35:59.418 --> 36:01.202
But they only had Bulworth's,

36:01.246 --> 36:03.291
uh, which I absolutely hate.

36:03.335 --> 36:05.293
Always gives me the winds.

36:05.337 --> 36:06.642
That's true.

36:06.686 --> 36:09.993
No, I'm telling you,
that was not on the ship.

36:10.037 --> 36:13.475
They don't keep ginger ale
in 55-gallon drum barrels.

36:13.519 --> 36:15.173
No, but they do keep
toxic waste.

36:15.608 --> 36:16.609
I ran the plate

36:16.652 --> 36:18.001
on the delivery truck.

36:18.045 --> 36:19.568
It's registered to a company

36:19.612 --> 36:22.615
called Peterson Waste Management
in D.C.

36:22.658 --> 36:25.183
Take Torres, find out who they
were working with on the ship,

36:25.226 --> 36:26.532
and hurry up.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.495
Wait, did I just...
did I just crack the case?

36:33.539 --> 36:36.368
I just cracked the
case, didn't I?

36:41.111 --> 36:43.505
So, how long is this gonna take?

36:43.549 --> 36:45.203
Look, I-I-- The ship is
about to leave soon,

36:45.246 --> 36:47.205
- and I gotta get back.
- You're not gonna make it.

36:48.249 --> 36:49.337
You recognize this man?

36:51.383 --> 36:52.384
No.

36:53.428 --> 36:56.257
His name is Jake Peterson.

36:56.301 --> 36:58.216
He runs
a waste management company

36:58.259 --> 37:00.740
that was illegally
dumping toxic waste.

37:00.783 --> 37:02.220
With your help.

37:04.570 --> 37:06.746
Look, no, no, no.
He-- You got this wrong.

37:06.789 --> 37:08.400
Stop the denial.

37:08.443 --> 37:10.793
Peterson already confessed
that the two of you smuggled in

37:10.837 --> 37:12.491
over 500 barrels.

37:12.534 --> 37:16.103
He even had tapes of the two
of you discussing the deal.

37:16.146 --> 37:17.626
- Lucky for us.
- Yeah,

37:17.670 --> 37:19.062
but not so lucky for you.

37:23.328 --> 37:25.678
It was his idea.

37:25.721 --> 37:28.071
He called me up
and asked me

37:28.115 --> 37:30.160
if I wanted to make
some-some extra cash.

37:30.204 --> 37:32.467
I figured why not.

37:32.511 --> 37:35.340
Easy money.
No one gets hurt.

37:35.383 --> 37:38.256
Except for Allison Howell
and, uh, Roger Burrows, right?

37:38.299 --> 37:39.387
No, no. No.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.084
That-that wasn't
supposed to happen.

37:41.128 --> 37:42.434
Allison went down
to the engine room

37:42.477 --> 37:44.262
and witnessed you dumping
the waste, didn't she?

37:44.305 --> 37:46.438
But killing those people
wasn't my idea.

37:46.481 --> 37:47.569
Then whose idea was it?

37:48.657 --> 37:50.703
Anybody needs me,
I'll be on the bridge.

37:51.791 --> 37:54.446
Excuse me? Captain Finch.

37:54.489 --> 37:56.665
NCIS. Mind if we have a word?

37:56.709 --> 37:58.493
Well, make it quick, gentlemen.
We're about to push off.

37:58.537 --> 37:59.799
Eh, shouldn't take long.

37:59.842 --> 38:02.323
We just, uh, talked to
your security officer.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.760
Yeah, I heard you brought
Granger in for questioning.

38:04.804 --> 38:07.285
So, he's responsible
for those deaths?

38:07.328 --> 38:08.547
Ah... no.

38:09.591 --> 38:10.766
But you are.

38:10.810 --> 38:12.507
I'm sorry?

38:12.551 --> 38:14.161
Granger gave you up,
told us about

38:14.204 --> 38:16.642
how you killed Allison Howell
and Commander Burrows.

38:16.685 --> 38:18.818
Me? That's ridiculous.

38:18.861 --> 38:21.429
Allison saw Granger dumping
the toxic waste.

38:21.473 --> 38:23.126
Went to you to report it.

38:23.170 --> 38:24.780
And instead of doing
the right thing, you got greedy

38:24.824 --> 38:26.739
and asked Granger
for a piece of the pie.

38:26.782 --> 38:29.132
Only thing left was to make sure
Allison didn't talk.

38:29.176 --> 38:30.308
So you killed her.

38:30.351 --> 38:31.483
And when Burrows came
asking questions,

38:31.526 --> 38:32.788
you killed him, too.

38:32.832 --> 38:34.529
And the captain here thought
he was in the clear

38:34.573 --> 38:36.357
until he learned about Judy.

38:36.401 --> 38:37.576
Then you got scared.

38:37.619 --> 38:38.838
You thought she might
know something.

38:38.881 --> 38:40.230
You needed her gone.

38:40.274 --> 38:41.754
Right, but you were stuck
on the ship,

38:41.797 --> 38:43.886
so you called Jake Peterson
to handle things.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.714
This is absurd.

38:45.758 --> 38:46.889
I don't have time for this.

38:46.933 --> 38:49.239
Pretty soon time is
all you're gonna have.

38:49.283 --> 38:50.371
I don't think so.

38:52.199 --> 38:54.157
evidence.

38:54.201 --> 38:56.334
All you have is Granger's word
against mine.

38:56.377 --> 38:59.772
That, and...

38:59.815 --> 39:01.556
the murder weapon.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.602
Found this in your cabin.

39:03.645 --> 39:05.821
You know what this is,
old-fashioned navigation tool

39:05.865 --> 39:07.214
called a divider caliper.

39:07.257 --> 39:08.650
The fang maker.

39:08.694 --> 39:10.609
See, the thing is,
the pointed ends here

39:10.652 --> 39:14.395
match the puncture wounds we
found on Burrows' neck exactly.

39:14.439 --> 39:15.875
You messed up, Captain.

39:15.918 --> 39:18.225
Never keep a souvenir
of a murder.

39:19.574 --> 39:20.662
<i>Looks like Zenith Cruise Line</i>

39:20.706 --> 39:22.490
is gonna need a new captain.

39:22.534 --> 39:23.752
Good work, people.

39:23.796 --> 39:25.232
Couldn't have done it
without Judy.

39:25.275 --> 39:26.364
Yeah. You got that right.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.811
Hey, uh, Parker.

39:38.854 --> 39:41.291
Something I can help you with,
Agent Torres?

39:41.335 --> 39:44.469
Yeah, about this, uh,
Bandium app.

39:44.512 --> 39:45.818
I read your post.

39:45.861 --> 39:47.515
You did?

39:47.559 --> 39:49.778
I thought you could've been
more original,

39:49.822 --> 39:51.606
but, uh, I've heard worse.

39:51.650 --> 39:53.869
- So you're not upset?
- I get it.

39:53.913 --> 39:55.654
I'm the new guy,

39:55.697 --> 39:58.570
which means I'm gonna come up
with a lot of new ideas.

39:58.613 --> 40:00.223
But the whole point of the app

40:00.267 --> 40:02.312
was to get us talking,
which we're doing now.

40:02.356 --> 40:04.314
And if you have
a problem with me,

40:04.358 --> 40:06.491
uh, say it to my face.

40:06.534 --> 40:08.493
I will do that.

40:09.668 --> 40:11.452
- Good.
- Anyone up for a burger?

40:11.496 --> 40:12.540
I'm buying.

40:12.584 --> 40:14.847
I could eat.
Yeah, me, too.

40:14.890 --> 40:17.023
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

40:18.459 --> 40:20.243
What? Somebody's got
to stay here

40:20.287 --> 40:21.854
and finish these case reports.

40:23.290 --> 40:24.944
Right.

40:27.381 --> 40:28.991
I'm just messing with you.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.732
You can do it tomorrow.
Come on.

40:39.959 --> 40:41.569
Here you go, Harold.

40:41.613 --> 40:43.484
Mom, are you sure
you don't want to stay?

40:43.528 --> 40:45.747
The repairs at your condo aren't
gonna be done for a while.

40:45.791 --> 40:47.923
Oh, no. This is for best.

40:47.967 --> 40:49.664
Especially for Tim.

40:49.708 --> 40:53.581
Besides, Harold and I have
to make up for lost time.

40:53.625 --> 40:55.278
Yeah, you and Harold
getting back together.

40:55.322 --> 40:56.628
Didn't see that one coming.

40:56.671 --> 40:59.457
You know, what Harold did
was quite romantic,

40:59.500 --> 41:00.936
if you think about it.

41:00.980 --> 41:03.635
Impersonating a delivery guy
to sneak into our house?

41:03.678 --> 41:04.984
He's very creative.

41:05.027 --> 41:06.333
Oh.

41:06.376 --> 41:07.508
Ooh, okay, we got to scoot.

41:07.552 --> 41:08.596
We don't want to be late

41:08.640 --> 41:09.945
for our meeting
with the travel agent.

41:09.989 --> 41:11.294
Travel agent?

41:11.338 --> 41:13.471
- Where you going?
- We're going on safari.

41:13.514 --> 41:14.950
Africa.

41:14.994 --> 41:17.736
Africa?
Oh, I was planning
on telling you about it.

41:20.782 --> 41:23.481
Well, you-you have
a wonderful time, Mom.

41:25.744 --> 41:28.616
Thank you.
I love you.

41:28.660 --> 41:30.531
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

41:30.575 --> 41:31.750
Thank you.

41:31.793 --> 41:34.013
You're the best.

41:34.056 --> 41:37.407
Now, I will email you
the entire itinerary.

41:37.451 --> 41:38.713
I promise.

41:40.541 --> 41:41.542
Bye.

41:41.586 --> 41:42.804
Bye, love you.

41:42.848 --> 41:44.371
Bye, love you, too.

41:45.372 --> 41:46.460
Africa.

41:47.679 --> 41:49.463
You handled that well.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.465
I did, didn't I?

41:52.510 --> 41:53.685
I'm proud of you.

41:55.861 --> 41:57.732
I'm not gonna get an email,
am I?

41:57.776 --> 41:59.473
No, I don't think we're
ever gonna hear from them.
