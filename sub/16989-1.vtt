00:38.280 --> 00:39.839
Not.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.120
Not.

00:52.160 --> 00:53.160
Not.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.033
Now we're Glamthrax.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.680
And we take no shit.

00:56.960 --> 00:59.031
And we don't care
for writing hits.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.317
The sound you hear
is what we like.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.990
And I'll steal your
puppets like I stole your...

01:04.280 --> 01:05.873
Socks.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.600
Yo, man,
what's the matter with you?

01:07.680 --> 01:09.096
Sorry, I'll get it next time,
I promise.

01:09.120 --> 01:11.077
Colleen beats the beats,
the beats you beat.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.397
The only thing harder
is the smell of my feet.

01:13.680 --> 01:16.275
So listen up 'cause
you might get dissed

01:16.560 --> 01:18.313
go drain the lizard or take a...

01:18.640 --> 01:19.640
Chair.

01:19.720 --> 01:21.996
Damn, c'mon, girl,
watch the beat.

01:22.280 --> 01:23.600
I'm on your case
I'm in your face.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.280
Get you and your
father back in place.

01:25.560 --> 01:26.914
Step up sucker understand.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.720
- Don't you know that...
- I'm the man.

01:28.880 --> 01:29.880
- I'm the man.
- I'm bad

01:30.160 --> 01:31.560
I'm so bad
I should be in detention.

01:31.720 --> 01:32.756
I'm the man!

01:33.040 --> 01:34.040
All right.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.998
We've got real def rhythms.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.436
And fresh new jams.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.437
You say we got egos.

01:38.720 --> 01:39.790
But we're just hams.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.120
Roof shit, top shelf.

01:41.320 --> 01:42.320
And we like to skate.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.120
But we're never on time,
we're always...

01:44.400 --> 01:45.595
- Sleeping.
- Late.

01:45.880 --> 01:46.880
Damn it.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.216
The important thing
is that you tried.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.674
Yeah.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.639
I'm on your case
I'm in your face.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.336
Put you and your
father back in place.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.680
Step up sucker, understand.

01:55.000 --> 01:55.512
- Don't you know that...
- Colleen C.: I'm the man.

01:55.840 --> 01:56.840
I'm the man, I'm bad.

01:57.080 --> 01:58.256
I'm so bad I should be
in detention.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.670
- I'm the man!
- Colleen C.: All right.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.030
So.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.039
As this rap is winding down.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.596
It's plain to see
we wear the crown.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.951
You know Glamthrax is number one.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.959
But we don't care,
we just wanna have...

02:11.240 --> 02:12.720
A festival.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.560
Fun, Colleen,
girls just wanna have fun.

02:14.600 --> 02:15.716
Hey, that's a song

02:16.000 --> 02:17.593
Colleen.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.473
Mailed the mail,
the mail she mailed.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.160
We are the queens
so all shall hail.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.272
We're like a diamond is forever.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.631
And we'll remain the hardest.

02:25.920 --> 02:30.949
Ever

02:35.640 --> 02:37.836
I'm so bad it's a crime.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.120
Not.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.160
Not, not, not, not-not.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.400
Woo!

03:17.200 --> 03:18.200
Yeah.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.199
Look at his cute little nipples.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.870
- Oh, my god, Ichabod, cover up.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.151
You know, I don't have to come
and beat the skins

03:39.480 --> 03:40.480
for you two Beliebers.

03:40.560 --> 03:41.720
- Colleen M.: Shut up.
- Yeah.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.114
You know we love you, Icha-wad.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.160
Remember when he ripped
off his shirt before

03:45.200 --> 03:46.793
and we saw his yummy Icha-bod?

03:47.120 --> 03:50.716
I nearly wrote a whole blog about
it, girl, hasthtag Ichagod.

03:51.040 --> 03:53.157
- You did?
- I did not.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.238
- Not, not, not-not.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.480
No.

03:59.680 --> 04:03.310
- Shit.
- Ichabod: No, what's that noise?

04:03.600 --> 04:07.150
Oh, no, do you two
uncompromising rebel riot girls

04:07.440 --> 04:09.159
actually have to
go back to work?

04:09.440 --> 04:11.671
- Shut up, Icha-bodily functions.
- Yeah.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.316
Excuse me,
Condescending Riot Girls.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.428
Uh, we'll take two packs of
smokes, gimme a bag of milk,

04:18.720 --> 04:20.856
and why don't you throw in
the best most exciting years

04:20.880 --> 04:22.837
of your life
stuck behind a counter, eh?

04:23.120 --> 04:24.120
You're a dick, Ichabod.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.240
Oh, that's mean.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.232
I call you Dickabod.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.434
I can't believe it took you this
long to think of Dickabod!

04:53.760 --> 04:57.071
Sorry aboot that.
Sorry aboot that.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.159
Sorry aboot that.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.998
Sorry aboot that.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.310
Sorry aboot that.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.557
Now, that was a lot
longer than 10 minutes.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.958
My best friend was having lady
problems in the bathroom, okay?

05:12.280 --> 05:13.280
May I shop?

05:13.440 --> 05:14.440
Sure.

05:16.760 --> 05:18.991
Sir Pedophile-in-Denial.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.873
So I'll see you guys Friday, eh?

05:23.400 --> 05:25.790
I said, eh?

05:28.920 --> 05:31.879
Wunderbar.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.999
Hi.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.313
Um, True Norths,
this week's issue of Them,

05:45.600 --> 05:47.034
and his Pucky Charms.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.033
And, um...
Condoms.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.555
Oh, my god,
this is about you two.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.116
Yes, ma'am, and we hate it.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.232
It says here
that you saved a man's life.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.440
But it's, like, dumb
because the guy was a walrus

06:04.480 --> 06:06.790
- and not a manatee.
- There's a big difference.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.958
Yeah, a walrus has
tusks and manatees don't.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.960
Did you know they called
the manatee a sea cow?

06:12.240 --> 06:15.870
Moo, I'm utterly underwater, eh?
Moo, moo, eh?

06:18.160 --> 06:19.840
That's her underwater cow,
it's hysterical.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.151
That is funny. C'mon, Wayne.

06:27.520 --> 06:33.551
Moo, moo, moo.
I'm a loser, eh?

06:36.640 --> 06:38.552
Okay, that kid rules.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.752
More of that,
less of everything else ever.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.160
Hunter Calloway's here,
Hunter Calloway's here!

06:56.240 --> 06:58.994
Oh, my god,
could you stop being so basic?

06:59.280 --> 07:02.000
Oh, I gotta Gram the shit
outta this.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.837
The little Colleen Coalition.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.349
- The only sassy, sexy...

07:12.640 --> 07:16.156
sophomores in Honors history
rockin' the smocks.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.160
Where's the Pepto Bismol?

07:25.280 --> 07:27.556
- Ew, it's over there.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.111
Sorry aboot that,
he's such a sitcom.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.760
Yeah, well,
we close in 20 minutes,

07:32.000 --> 07:33.480
so if he pukes,
you're cleaning it up.

07:33.760 --> 07:36.878
Let me ask you somethin',
you ladies like workin' the Zed?

07:37.160 --> 07:38.799
- Not at all.
- Customers make it suck.

07:39.080 --> 07:42.039
Yeah, you know what
wouldn't suck?

07:42.320 --> 07:45.313
Colleen and Colleen
with me in between.

07:45.640 --> 07:48.599
The very definition of suck.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.395
Are the Colleen's, perchance,
working tomorrow?

07:51.680 --> 07:53.751
Not on a Friday night, no way.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.076
We're off, why?

07:55.400 --> 07:58.199
I would like to invite
you both to my party.

07:58.480 --> 07:59.480
A senior party?

07:59.560 --> 08:00.755
A neenior nardy?

08:01.080 --> 08:04.278
Now with two very
cool sophomores.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.559
May I have the honor of
your number, mademoiselle?

08:24.880 --> 08:26.109
Who's there?

08:27.840 --> 08:31.117
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

08:34.520 --> 08:38.116
Wunderbar.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.235
- Oh, oh.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.679
Get out of my bum!

08:48.680 --> 08:50.280
Ms. McKenzie:
A grade 12 party with boys?

08:50.320 --> 08:52.471
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.759
I'm not aboot to let you go to a
grade 12 party with boys, Colleen.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.399
It's just a grade 12 party,
it's not the Nazi Party.

09:04.720 --> 09:09.033
Senior boys only invite sophomore
girls to parties for one thing.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.158
- Well, me and Colleen
don't do that.

09:11.480 --> 09:14.552
And even if we did,
we have our periods this week.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.376
Ms. McKenzie:
No, you don't, little liar.

09:16.400 --> 09:19.393
We're always in-sync and I don't
get mine for two more weeks.

09:19.680 --> 09:22.195
Holy shit, you still get
your period Ms. McKenzie?

09:24.080 --> 09:25.878
Please, you have to
let me go to this party.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.954
It's only the most important
night of my entire life.

09:29.240 --> 09:32.233
No way. Just the thought of
going to a grade 12 party

09:32.520 --> 09:35.035
has you lying to me about
your menstrual cycle.

09:35.320 --> 09:38.119
And you know a woman's menstrual
cycle is sacred, Colleen.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.995
I'm talking aboot
the period blood of women.

09:42.920 --> 09:43.976
Colleen M.:
Please, just let me go, Mom.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.071
I promise won't sellout
on my gender ever again.

09:46.360 --> 09:49.831
On one condition,
you bring something stabby.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.316
They get cute, they get cut.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.875
Holy shit.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.117
I call her The Mohel,
she's my date knife.

09:56.440 --> 09:57.794
Thanks.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.599
So we start with
Pretentious Frog.

10:04.920 --> 10:07.719
Pretentious Frog,
"I only eat grass-fed flies."

10:14.480 --> 10:16.119
The Dissatisfied Customer.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.835
Dissatisfied Customer.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.311
"I don't like
the product you've given me."

10:23.640 --> 10:26.360
Atlas Shrugged, Atlas Shrugged.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.800
We've got Atlas
and then we shrug.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.600
Do Lasers from the Wrists,
Lasers from the Wrists.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.792
Yoga Fett, Yoga Fett.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.856
Awkward Conversationalist,
we put our foot in a mouth.

10:35.880 --> 10:36.916
Foot in the mouth.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.669
Upward Dog, our favorite canine.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.437
Downward Dog.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.791
Here we go
Three-Legged Dog.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.589
That's sad, Three-Legged Dog,
look at that dog.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.234
But you know what's sadder?

10:49.520 --> 10:51.512
Two-Legged Dog,
and he's in his little pushcart,

10:51.800 --> 10:55.316
his little makeshift wheelbarrow
and he's pushing himself along.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.479
We push right into
Lotus Position.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.998
And we feel positive
energy all around us.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.397
And let's hold onto that
positive energy in the room.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.720
But, you know,
I did read on the message boards

11:09.760 --> 11:11.336
at CanadianCorpses.com
that they've been finding

11:11.360 --> 11:13.477
body parts all over Winnipeg
for the last few months.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.072
Body parts?

11:18.400 --> 11:21.438
Oh, yeah, arms, legs,
heads, scalps, torsos,

11:21.720 --> 11:24.599
feet, hands, nipples, dinkies.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.872
- Dinkies?

11:27.200 --> 11:30.432
I said, "Take my dinky first,
but leave me my nipples."

11:30.720 --> 11:32.560
It's basically a vestigial
dinky at this point.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.355
But you take my nipples,
and that's my identity.

11:35.640 --> 11:38.314
There's some real negativity in
the world, girls. But remember,

11:38.600 --> 11:42.435
negative space can still be a design
asset, as long as you live the Yoga Way.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.877
And you breathe the Yoga Way.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.311
And. yes, you even have to
shit the Yoga Way.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.816
Seriously. sit in Lotus Position
next time you're on the toilet,

11:49.840 --> 11:53.311
everything just falls out of you.
Like you're dumping a book bag.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.233
A book bag full of poo.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.959
- Go.

12:07.800 --> 12:12.113
Okay. let me see.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.472
That one's cute. that one's cute,
don't post that one though.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.080
Okay. yeah, you look basic.

12:17.360 --> 12:21.195
Oh. what in the ham and
eggs is this all about?

12:21.480 --> 12:24.393
It looks like a
Vancouver Hockey Riot in here.

12:24.720 --> 12:25.760
What'd you do. rob a mall?

12:31.360 --> 12:32.794
- Hi. Dad.
- Hi, Mr. Collette.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.416
What are you doin'
with all these clothes?

12:34.440 --> 12:36.796
- We're screening outfits.
- Oh. yeah?

12:37.080 --> 12:39.176
Whatever gets the most likes. we
wear to the party tomorrow night.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.350
A grade 12 party.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.916
No!

12:43.240 --> 12:45.277
A grade 12 party already eh?

12:48.120 --> 12:50.430
Oh. where did my little girl go?

12:50.720 --> 12:53.633
Aw. stop.
You two are gonna make me cry.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.957
- Tabitha: I'm back.
- Hey. hey!

12:56.240 --> 12:58.914
That's gonna make me cry.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.953
- Bob: Hey. Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

13:07.560 --> 13:08.880
- A little tongue.
- I bit ya. eh?

13:10.800 --> 13:11.800
I got a bite!

13:17.680 --> 13:20.240
Oh. my god. It looks like a
Vancouver Hockey Riot in here.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.560
I know. I know.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.160
What is this.
What are you two doing?

13:23.400 --> 13:25.560
They're picking out their
outfits for a party tomorrow.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.756
A grade 12 party.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.077
Oh.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.471
- Bob: Big time. big time.
- Oh. with seniors now.

13:31.760 --> 13:32.238
I know.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.718
She's only supposed to go
to sophomore mixers. I thought.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.919
Yeah. right. C'mon. Tabs,
we all know you can't think.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.200
Mm-hmm.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.550
Okay. okay.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.536
When I went to count out
the register tonight.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.153
The back room was a mess.
Yeah?

13:45.440 --> 13:46.440
Colleen.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.936
Okay. they can't be
practicing in the back

13:47.960 --> 13:49.030
of the store anymore. Bob.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.711
Last year. they blew out
the power with their amps.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.336
Yeah. it's bad enough the
two of them are always

13:54.360 --> 13:56.400
with their faces in their
phones behind the counter.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.239
Such pretty faces too.
Pretty faces.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.711
Lock up the store and go
play their so-called music

14:01.000 --> 14:03.959
in the backroom with
that pederast loser.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.556
- He's not a loser.
- God knows what else. eh?

14:06.840 --> 14:08.911
That's disgusting.
Absolutely disgusting.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.640
And. like. who are we? You?

14:10.920 --> 14:12.877
Skeezing on losers
is your superpower.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.078
This isn't skeezing. okay?

14:15.360 --> 14:17.556
I fell in love with your father.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.957
After he made you manager.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.436
And as manager.
You know what I've noticed?

14:22.720 --> 14:24.120
Where'd all the
beaver stuffies go?

14:24.400 --> 14:26.119
Not the beavers!

14:26.400 --> 14:27.470
Oh yeah.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.996
- No. that's a big seller.
- Yeah. yeah.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.431
They didn't sell 'em.
I checked the receipts.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.479
She checked
She checked the receipts.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.871
Where'd all my beavers go?

14:37.160 --> 14:39.595
Frankly. Tabitha. I don't
give a damn about your beavers.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.080
Goddamned yoga hosers.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.880
Where's little
Miss Wo-Manager going?

14:46.160 --> 14:47.616
We're just gonna go in
our room and we're gonna

14:47.640 --> 14:49.552
I'm gonna we're just gonna
go watch a movie.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.753
- Okay?
- Oh can you just do me a favor?

14:53.040 --> 14:58.274
Can you just leave
the door open. though?

14:59.120 --> 15:00.270
Love you. Dad.

15:03.520 --> 15:04.520
Close the door. Bob.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.396
All the way. Bob.

15:11.720 --> 15:12.312
She told me not to.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.633
God. she's the daughter.
Bob, not the parent.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.957
You're in charge. not her.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.799
What do you want me to do. eh?

15:20.080 --> 15:22.754
That's my little girl.
That's my little girl.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.833
I'm your little girl. Bob.

15:26.880 --> 15:30.635
Bob. do you wanna ride
the Ferris Wheel. Bob?

15:30.920 --> 15:31.976
Don't talk about the
Ferris Wheel. don't talk about.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.673
Wanna go for a ride
on the Ferris Wheel?

15:33.960 --> 15:34.960
I don't wanna Oh!

15:35.120 --> 15:36.793
You wanna jump in
the bouncy house?

15:37.120 --> 15:38.640
You'll let me jump
in the bouncy house?

15:38.680 --> 15:40.319
Twice.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.160
- Oh. my god.
- What. you finished already?

15:55.200 --> 15:57.715
Oh. come on.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.594
- I'm sorry. sorry.

16:01.080 --> 16:02.719
What is she playing?

16:04.400 --> 16:10.158
Babe I'm leavin'
I must be on my way.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.632
- The time is drawing near.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.832
I used to sing this to her
when she was a baby.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.598
- My train is going

16:18.880 --> 16:22.430
- I see it in your eyes.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.270
The love. the need,
your tears.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.597
She she just remembers it.

16:28.920 --> 16:34.473
But I'll be lonely without you.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.554
And I'll need your love
to see me through.

16:37.880 --> 16:40.839
She's just growing up so fast.
You know?

16:41.120 --> 16:44.750
So please believe me my
heart is in your hands.

16:45.040 --> 16:50.115
Cause' I'll be missing you.

16:54.640 --> 16:58.475
You know it's you Babe.

16:58.760 --> 17:03.471
Whenever I get weary
and I've had enough.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.434
Feel like giving up.

17:06.720 --> 17:11.431
- You know it's you Babe.

17:11.720 --> 17:17.000
Giving me the courage and
the strength I need.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.431
Please believe.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.752
That it's true.

17:25.040 --> 17:30.274
Babe I love you.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.275
Goddamned yoga hosers.

17:50.280 --> 17:53.990
You know it's you Babe.

17:54.280 --> 17:59.639
Whenever I get weary
and I've had enough.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.752
Feel like giving up.

18:02.040 --> 18:06.592
You know it's you Babe.

18:06.880 --> 18:12.592
Giving me the courage and
the strength I need.

18:12.880 --> 18:16.510
Please believe that it's true.

18:19.920 --> 18:22.879
Babe I love you.

18:25.960 --> 18:30.796
Babe I love you.

18:32.280 --> 18:36.399
Oooh... Babe.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.472
Ladies. Up Dog.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.798
One. two. three.

18:57.360 --> 18:58.794
What a farce.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.800
I can't believe they
actually have the balls

19:00.920 --> 19:03.310
- to try to call this Yoga.
- I know.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.114
Ms. Wicklund: How are ya. girls?

19:09.400 --> 19:11.198
Ms. Wicklund.
You photo bombed us.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.312
Way hip. Ms. Wick.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.360
What makes you two
think that you can sit out

19:15.640 --> 19:16.915
of my yoga class this morning?

19:23.280 --> 19:26.478
This isn't yoga.
This is like a parody of yoga.

19:26.800 --> 19:30.157
And our yoga instructor gave us this
note to give to you. Ms. Wicklund.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.840
We have permission to
sit oot anytime you do yoga

19:35.920 --> 19:38.071
here in Phys Ed because he
doesn't want his teachings

19:38.400 --> 19:40.960
derailed by what he calls.
"The abortion of Phys Ed Yoga."

19:41.280 --> 19:44.717
Well far be it me to argue
with a strip-mall swami.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.559
Uh. technically he's a yogi.
Right?

19:46.840 --> 19:50.311
Technically.
There's a school honor policy

19:50.600 --> 19:51.829
aboot camera phones in PE.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.276
There is?

19:53.560 --> 19:56.439
Do any of you ladies want
to be photographed by these

19:56.720 --> 19:58.712
two while you're all
sweatin' like hogs?

19:59.040 --> 20:00.360
- All: No.
- I didn't think so.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.632
Is she talking aboot us?

20:02.960 --> 20:05.919
No. she's talking aboot the
other two Colleens behind us.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.440
Ms. Wicklund: I'm talkin' aboot
you're entire generation.

20:08.640 --> 20:12.156
Generation Why Me? I call it.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.000
You live on your phones.

20:15.280 --> 20:18.751
You have no idea how to function like
normal people in the real world.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.952
Ms. Wicklund.
This isn't the real world.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.634
This is Canada.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.513
Ms. Wicklund:
Oh. is that right. eh?

20:24.800 --> 20:26.600
Well. how about you save
your Can-bashin' sass

20:26.840 --> 20:29.150
for your tweets.
And your Facebookins'.

20:29.440 --> 20:32.399
And try clickin' like on this.
Girls.

20:32.680 --> 20:35.957
No phones for the
rest of the day!

20:36.960 --> 20:37.598
What?

20:37.920 --> 20:40.833
You can get 'em back at 2:45.
After the last bell.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.715
Ms. Wicklund.
Our phones are who we are.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.176
If you take away my phone like I'm
some sort of pygmy in Monaco.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.795
- Who am I supposed to be?
- I feel like I'm going to pass oot.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.992
And now Colleen M.'s
having hot flashes.

20:51.280 --> 20:53.556
Ms. Wicklund: You're on a new
phone plan now. girls.

20:53.840 --> 20:56.753
Unlimited minutes. unlimited
looks to the world around you.

20:57.040 --> 20:59.032
And no roaming charges.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.273
So go roam.
Withoot your phones!

21:02.560 --> 21:04.472
Here I go.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.356
Are you happy. Ms. Wicklund?
You killed Colleen.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.679
- The gym floor was really hard.
- I know. it's okay.

21:20.840 --> 21:23.639
Greetings.
Cess-bearing scholars.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.080
Are you ready to go deep
inside the annals of history?

21:32.880 --> 21:36.032
We're still talking aboot
World War II.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.880
Fascists. Genocide.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.755
The worst thing that has
ever happened to human kind.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.376
Why do we even gotta learn about
this old stuff anyway. Ms. Maurice?

21:45.400 --> 21:48.438
I mean. it happened. like.
A million miles away,

21:48.720 --> 21:49.720
like a million years ago.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.320
Mon dieu?

21:51.600 --> 21:54.035
You all think history
is so boring.

21:54.320 --> 21:57.791
Well. what if I told you.
During World War II.

21:58.120 --> 22:01.033
There were Nazis right here.
In Winnipeg?

22:01.320 --> 22:04.279
All of them making
preparation for the day Hitler

22:04.560 --> 22:07.519
finally came to conquer
Canada and the United States.

22:07.840 --> 22:10.071
There were Nazis here in Canada.
Ms. Maurice?

22:10.360 --> 22:13.797
Ms. Maurice: Let's see. what can
I tell you about Canadian Nazis?

22:14.760 --> 22:18.436
Well. many years back
in the 1930's there was

22:18.720 --> 22:21.110
a great depression
in the True North.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.794
Canadians were hungry.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.470
Some turned their hunger into anger.
And they looked for

22:25.760 --> 22:28.878
someone else to blame for
the country's financial woes.

22:29.200 --> 22:34.275
And as a result. in Toronto.
The first Swastika Club opens.

22:34.560 --> 22:37.678
A pub full of drunks.
Offering up anti-Semitic rabble

22:38.000 --> 22:40.469
aboot deporting Canadian Jews
to the Hudson Bay.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.434
Wait. they wanted
to send them shopping?

22:43.720 --> 22:46.758
Not to the Hudson Bay
department store. Ms. Collette.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.430
I'm talkin' aboot the
actual Hudson Bay.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.160
Like.
Put them all oot in the water?

22:51.320 --> 22:53.073
That's just so wrong.

22:53.360 --> 22:55.750
The Canadian Union of
Fascists was founded right here.

22:56.040 --> 22:59.158
In Winnipeg by a Manitoban.

22:59.480 --> 23:02.120
And over in Quebec. you had
the big kahuna of crazy himself.

23:02.440 --> 23:06.639
The nuttiest of all nut bars.
Adrien Arcand.

23:06.920 --> 23:09.116
The self-proclaimed
Canadian fuhrer.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.194
So. this Arcand guy was.
Like. Canadian Hitler?

23:12.480 --> 23:15.154
Is that as bad as.
Like. Canadian Idol?

23:15.440 --> 23:18.080
- Nothing's as bad as Canadian Idol.
- Right?

23:18.360 --> 23:21.717
Let me take you back to
a time in Canadian History

23:22.040 --> 23:25.033
this nation has tried
so very hard to forget.

23:25.560 --> 23:27.313
In this trying time...

23:27.600 --> 23:29.736
Ms. Maurice: Adrien Arcand
was an anti-Semitic journalist

23:29.760 --> 23:33.310
in Montreal who spearheaded
a series of fascist political

23:33.640 --> 23:36.314
movements in Quebec before
the start of World War II.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.069
Why are you hungry?

23:40.360 --> 23:42.317
Why are you unemployed?

23:42.640 --> 23:47.954
Is it. as our ally in Germany.
Adolf Hitler. tells us,

23:48.280 --> 23:51.637
the fault of the Canadian Jew?
Yes. it is!

23:54.520 --> 23:58.958
Now Henry Hamilton Beamish
suggests that to save

23:59.280 --> 24:02.990
Canada from ethnic ruin.
We must send all Canadian Jews

24:03.280 --> 24:04.999
to Madagascar.

24:05.280 --> 24:11.516
Instead. we at the Parti
National have a better plan.

24:17.200 --> 24:21.160
First. we will round
up all Canadian Jews

24:21.480 --> 24:24.314
and ship them off
to the Hudson Bay.

24:24.640 --> 24:28.600
Then we will fire cannons
at their boats

24:28.880 --> 24:30.837
and sink them!

24:32.880 --> 24:34.360
Why are you not applauding?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.472
Ms. Maurice: Naturally.
These atrocious ideas

24:36.760 --> 24:37.760
were met with derisions

24:37.880 --> 24:39.456
from the good and
mighty people of Quebec.

24:39.480 --> 24:42.154
This plan is the shit!

24:43.120 --> 24:45.840
Ms. Maurice: But not everyone in
attendance that day was from Quebec.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.390
Wunderbar! Wunderbar!

24:50.200 --> 24:52.376
Ms. Maurice: Andronicus Arcane
was a brilliant scientist

24:52.400 --> 24:55.871
from Berlin who was teaching at the
University of Lachute in Quebec

24:56.160 --> 24:59.392
when he first heard the
clarion call of the Nazi Party.

24:59.720 --> 25:03.191
So. Adrien Arcand took Andronicus
Arcane under his wing.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.996
And soon there were more.

25:07.960 --> 25:09.872
These jackbooted thugs
would torment immigrants

25:10.160 --> 25:12.629
and minorities
throughout Montreal.

25:12.920 --> 25:17.915
They called themselves the
National Unity Party of Canada.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.236
Which was a very
polite way of saying

25:21.520 --> 25:24.513
Canadian Nazis.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.237
So what ever happened
to these guys. Ms. Maurice?

25:36.520 --> 25:37.920
They ever get caught?

25:38.200 --> 25:42.831
In 1940 the Service de
Quebec arrested Adrien Arcand.

25:43.120 --> 25:46.033
And under the War Measures Act.
Arcand was locked up

25:46.320 --> 25:48.551
as a security threat to
our home and native land.

25:48.840 --> 25:52.516
He died in 1967 still believing
Hitler would rise again.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.160
But what aboot
the man from Berlin?

25:54.360 --> 25:56.556
Oh. Yeah. What aboot him?

25:56.840 --> 25:59.150
Andronicus Arcane?

26:01.280 --> 26:03.795
He was never found.

26:04.120 --> 26:06.271
Poof!
He just disappeared.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.758
- Both: Poof?

26:10.080 --> 26:14.120
Perfect timing class dismissed.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.314
How basic.

26:27.640 --> 26:31.077
Straight from the Eh-to-Zed
it's the Mountie McBeaver Doll.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.312
Oh. Where did
all my beaver stuffies go?

26:33.600 --> 26:34.600
Well. frankly Tabitha.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.554
I don't give a damn
about your beavers.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.035
Are you doing me?

26:40.840 --> 26:43.674
- That's hysterical.
- I know.

26:43.960 --> 26:45.440
C'mon. Isn't anybody on duty?

26:45.720 --> 26:47.632
Who's dropping a
doodie in my office? Oh!

26:54.160 --> 26:57.278
What a nice surprise.
It's Lulu and Lemon.

26:57.560 --> 26:59.472
Good afternoon
Principle Invincible.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.156
Good afternoon.
Colleen squared.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.669
We're here for our phones.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.536
Colleen M.:
We haven't had them since PE.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.199
Ms. Wicklund unjustly
confiscated them.

27:07.520 --> 27:08.795
And Colleen here fainted.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.799
- I passed oot.
- Oh!

27:11.080 --> 27:12.896
Colleen C.: We're not
pressing charges or anything.

27:12.920 --> 27:13.512
We're not going crazy.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.553
We just want our
phones back now. please.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.433
Oh. Of course girls.

27:17.720 --> 27:21.316
And I am so. so sorry
that that happened to you.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.195
The sad tale of
heart-wrenching woe.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.073
I mean. it could win an Oscar.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.795
Really. you could write it up,
sell it, and win an Oscar.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.839
Seriously. you could call it.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.436
Um. Twelve Years a Private
School Student.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.560
You see what I did there?

27:35.880 --> 27:38.554
I compared your privileged
lives to slaves.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.115
And that's weird.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.834
'Cause I'm black.

27:43.480 --> 27:44.480
That's not funny.

27:44.720 --> 27:46.916
Sorry.
Principle Invincible.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.474
Principle Invincible: Here.

27:50.760 --> 27:52.280
And keep your faces
out of your phones.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.836
I don't care if they do have
a cool gummy rubber cover

27:55.120 --> 27:56.120
that you can personalize.

27:56.280 --> 27:57.600
- We have the same case!
- I know.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.911
Very trendy. my friendy.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.197
Oh. Ladies. I am an educator.

28:02.480 --> 28:04.496
It is my job to shape the minds
of the young and the stupid.

28:04.520 --> 28:09.800
So I need to be able to think.
Like the young and the stupid.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.760
Which means I'm not gonna let
my students be cooler than me.

28:13.080 --> 28:16.471
I do my research.
I read this rag. weekly.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.956
Oh my god.
We read that every week.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.240
Oh. I know.

28:20.440 --> 28:23.194
The "Famous People Are Just
Like You" page is the best.

28:23.480 --> 28:24.736
You know. when they, like,
show the celebrities

28:24.760 --> 28:26.056
doing normal things.
Like. just like us.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.520
That is the best
part of Them Weekly.

28:27.800 --> 28:30.110
One time they showed
Harry Styles buying bacon.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.910
- It was so hot.
- So hot.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.880
Okay. all right.
I need to run this school.

28:41.160 --> 28:44.198
Be good Colleens.
And be nice, all right?

28:44.480 --> 28:46.312
There's enough haters
in the world already.

28:46.600 --> 28:50.196
Yes.
Principle Invincible.

28:52.920 --> 28:57.278
Oh my god. my phone's dead,
my phone's dead!

28:57.560 --> 28:59.517
Colleen M.:
Oh my god! My phone's dead!

28:59.840 --> 29:02.639
Guy Lapointe: Children should
not play with dead things.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.831
Bonjour.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.395
My name is Guy Lapointe.

29:17.200 --> 29:20.591
Righty-oh. So the good news is

29:20.920 --> 29:24.516
your school library does
indeed have a copy of my book.

29:24.800 --> 29:32.800
Guy Lapointe and the Quite Queer
Case of the Manitoba Manatee.

29:33.280 --> 29:37.593
The bad news is. regrettably.
Some naughty student

29:37.920 --> 29:42.995
has decided to deface it
by changing the word "Guy"

29:43.280 --> 29:46.751
and adding in "A"
so that it says "Gay".

29:48.480 --> 29:50.790
And also.

29:51.240 --> 29:55.154
They added a set of testicles
right under my nose.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.949
- You see that? You see that?

29:58.240 --> 30:01.039
With that kind of.
You know, awful poking hair,

30:01.360 --> 30:04.956
I don't know why.
Sticking out of them.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.680
You can put it down now.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.792
Oh. Okay.

30:09.080 --> 30:14.360
Haters have got to hate.
Like the douches have to douche.

30:14.640 --> 30:17.235
That's the life.
Right there in a nutshell.

30:17.520 --> 30:21.309
I'm not referring to
that nutshell either.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.316
I don't know if you
guys remember this.

30:24.600 --> 30:27.274
But you know we did meet
once before. Do you?

30:27.560 --> 30:29.119
- Oh. We remember you.
- Guy: You do?

30:29.400 --> 30:31.392
Yeah. you came to Eh-2-Zed
with that American girl

30:31.720 --> 30:32.720
and that podcaster.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.536
Yeah. You're the legendary
man hunter from Quebec.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.358
Yes. I am that man.

30:36.680 --> 30:38.399
The man who saved
the Winnipeg Walrus.

30:38.720 --> 30:42.430
Wow. you know something?
That's a very good title.

30:42.720 --> 30:46.953
Guy Lapointe and
the Winnipeg Walrus.

30:47.280 --> 30:50.796
Goddammit.
I should've chose that title.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.993
But. you know, still, we did
okay without it. I mean...

30:54.320 --> 30:56.630
One critic even described
my book as. like.

30:56.920 --> 31:02.473
You know. like a uh,
John Grisham-ist thriller

31:02.760 --> 31:04.752
who was set in the Canada.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.549
That review I
showed to my mother.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.360
- Aw.
- Mm.

31:09.640 --> 31:13.429
And you know, that was. like, the
good one, and the rest of them were

31:13.760 --> 31:15.319
not so kind. you see.

31:15.640 --> 31:19.031
I read one from the
Toronto Paper that said.

31:19.320 --> 31:24.156
"This is what happens when
you publish poop."

31:27.000 --> 31:29.310
People can be goddamn
mean. You know?

31:30.560 --> 31:32.472
Sorry. That was very rude.

31:32.760 --> 31:33.760
Sorry aboot that.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.196
Right. on to my
questions then.

31:36.480 --> 31:40.315
Do either of you recognize

31:40.600 --> 31:43.877
this very proud and
quite hairy Canadian?

31:44.160 --> 31:46.880
That was that giant fart
that called us yoga hosers.

31:47.160 --> 31:49.550
- Oh. Toilet Paper Man.
- Yeah.

31:49.880 --> 31:51.519
Why Toilet Paper Man?

31:51.840 --> 31:53.000
Cause he bought toilet paper.

31:53.160 --> 31:54.514
- He bought toilet paper.
- Duh.

31:54.840 --> 31:58.390
And for this reason alone you call
this man the Toilet Paper Man?

31:58.720 --> 32:00.234
- Well. yeah.
- Yeah.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.358
I don't mean to be a critic.
Maybe I do.

32:02.680 --> 32:04.114
Maybe you need to be hurt.

32:04.440 --> 32:07.160
I'm telling you now. that is
one of the stupidest names

32:07.480 --> 32:09.676
I ever heard in my life.
Very unimaginative.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.838
- That's pretty rude.
- Yeah.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.589
This man's name is
the Francois Jois.

32:14.880 --> 32:19.830
He's from Gatineau. Quebec.
And he was a fugitive

32:20.160 --> 32:22.994
from the law. and he was
hiding out right here.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.600
Hiding from what?

32:24.920 --> 32:27.515
He was hiding from the
investigating prowess of

32:27.840 --> 32:31.072
the Service de Quebec.
Which is kind of a joke.

32:31.360 --> 32:34.080
Because. like, they couldn't
find their own butt holes

32:34.360 --> 32:37.910
even with. like, a butt hole
application on their telephone

32:38.200 --> 32:40.920
to find their butt hole.

32:41.200 --> 32:42.475
Okay.

32:42.840 --> 32:44.877
I probably shouldn't say
butt hole

32:45.160 --> 32:47.038
to two 14-year-old girls.
I'm so sorry.

32:47.360 --> 32:48.840
We're 15 and a half.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.918
Well. whatever.

32:52.280 --> 32:58.720
You sold a roll of Eh-2-Zed
discount brand bathroom tissue

32:59.000 --> 33:02.118
to the Toilet Paper Man
at what time?

33:02.400 --> 33:03.400
Right aboot closing.

33:03.680 --> 33:06.149
Yeah. he was all mad because
we had the store closed

33:06.440 --> 33:09.239
for. like, five minutes 'cause
we were going to the bathroom.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.989
You went to the
bathroom together?

33:12.280 --> 33:13.280
Colleen M.: Well. yeah.

33:13.520 --> 33:17.070
I had to poop and I don't like to
go alone there. The toilet's weird.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.670
So while she's pooping.

33:20.880 --> 33:22.997
You're sitting there with her?

33:23.280 --> 33:25.715
Yeah. we're best
friends. Yeah.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Why would we not?

33:27.240 --> 33:29.391
That's quite disgusting.

33:31.040 --> 33:34.351
Best of luck on your
academic journey.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.791
Um. I don't know what you
plan to do in life.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.356
But I can promise you that
you won't need algebra.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.640
I knew it.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.673
Good day.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.595
Well. wait.
What'd Toilet Paper Man do?

33:47.240 --> 33:49.755
Oh.

33:53.560 --> 33:58.237
So. Toilet Paper Man was killed.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.914
Oh my god.

34:01.200 --> 34:04.034
He was cut into.
Like. a hundred pieces.

34:04.320 --> 34:05.959
Ew. no way.

34:06.240 --> 34:08.516
Well anyway. you two
girls with the same name,

34:08.800 --> 34:10.518
I thank you so
much for your time.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.154
And I give you the Au Revoir

34:12.480 --> 34:14.676
that I should have
given you before.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.679
I thank you.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.632
Okay.

34:21.600 --> 34:25.389
Ew. Why did your dad
text me. like, 37 times?

34:25.679 --> 34:27.797
Oh my god.
He's making us work tonight.

34:29.239 --> 34:30.536
Colleen C.:
You're going to Niagara Falls?

34:30.560 --> 34:33.120
Yup. Cruising like a couple
of Californians. How bout that?

34:33.400 --> 34:34.800
- Right now?
- Yeah.

34:35.080 --> 34:36.275
Colleen C.: You can't leave.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.516
It's Niagara Falls. Colleen.

34:38.840 --> 34:41.036
We're settin' sail on
the Maid of the Mist.

34:41.320 --> 34:42.320
When did this happen?

34:42.440 --> 34:43.719
Oh. Tabitha surprised me with it

34:43.760 --> 34:45.176
as an early
birthday present this morning.

34:45.199 --> 34:46.270
Tabitha.

34:46.600 --> 34:47.600
Okay. you listen to me.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.576
I left you 10 messages
and a bushel of texts.

34:49.600 --> 34:50.896
I'm sorry. but you gotta
work at the store tonight.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.070
We can't. actually.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.096
Yes. you can. Colleen M., 'cause
I cleared it with your mom

34:54.120 --> 34:55.815
and you're going to be staying with
the McKenzies until Sunday morning.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.799
Mr. Collette. we got invited
to a grade 12 party tonight.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.080
Do you not remember?

35:00.320 --> 35:02.710
All I remember is Tabitha
telling me somethin' about

35:03.000 --> 35:06.914
flying to Niagara Falls. and after
that it is a blur of bliss.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.836
So happy. Bob.

35:12.160 --> 35:14.000
I'll get that for ya.
I love the leopard print.

35:14.040 --> 35:14.473
I love the leopard print.

35:14.760 --> 35:16.376
Okay girls. you're gonna be
working from six pm

35:16.400 --> 35:17.600
until closing and don't forget

35:17.800 --> 35:19.473
to set the alarm before
you lock up. okay?

35:19.800 --> 35:21.176
You did this on purpose.
Didn't you?

35:21.200 --> 35:24.034
You could have taken him any
day. but you picked today.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.576
Just so we couldn't go
to the party.

35:25.600 --> 35:28.559
I have no idea what you're
talking aboot. Colleen.

35:30.760 --> 35:31.876
Goddamned yoga hosers.

35:32.160 --> 35:34.550
I love you so much.
Cauliflower. I love you so much.

35:34.840 --> 35:37.992
Listen. no boys. no boys.
No bull, no boys, no boys.

35:38.320 --> 35:39.456
- Okay. I gotta go.
- Colleen C.: Dad. Dad!

35:39.480 --> 35:44.111
- Dad.
- Dad! You can't leave.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.119
- Come on. please.
- Dad. we have...

35:49.400 --> 35:51.517
No!

35:55.640 --> 35:56.640
Oh. my god!

35:56.960 --> 35:59.429
No. no. no. no, no.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.752
Oh. you are killing me,
do you understand me?

36:02.040 --> 36:04.475
Killing me!

36:04.800 --> 36:06.473
Bark all you want.
Lawyer pants USA.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.712
I am not ceasing or desisting.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.320
Oh. Is that so?

36:10.640 --> 36:13.314
Well. I think you're being
rather obtuse and super fruity.

36:13.640 --> 36:16.678
So let's just say Namaste.
And leave it at that. eh?

36:16.960 --> 36:18.838
Namaste.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.680
You piece of beaver shit.

36:21.960 --> 36:24.156
Colleen M.: Beaver shit?

36:29.920 --> 36:31.639
Sorry. girls.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.389
I am so sorry you girls
had to hear that parasite

36:34.680 --> 36:37.070
stealing my energies.
With his legal entitlement.

36:37.360 --> 36:39.352
Why does that lawyer
from Warner Brothers even

36:39.640 --> 36:40.656
keep calling you Yogi Bayer?

36:40.680 --> 36:41.750
Oh. who knows?

36:42.040 --> 36:44.839
He says there's some cartoon
character that I'm violating.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.952
I mean. how can you
violate a cartoon?

36:47.240 --> 36:48.913
How do you own a cartoon. right?

36:49.200 --> 36:49.758
Yeah.

36:50.040 --> 36:53.397
It's like a thing that doesn't exist.
It's like owning a leprechaun.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.074
Rude.

36:55.360 --> 36:57.875
So rude.
Okay. let's get back into it.

36:58.160 --> 36:59.160
Enough Sasketoonin'.

36:59.320 --> 37:02.313
Let's get back into our
Warrior One.

37:04.560 --> 37:09.760
Up to Perfection. Colleen C..
Hold that pose Colleen M..

37:10.080 --> 37:11.514
Hold it.

37:11.800 --> 37:15.077
Warrior Two.

37:16.760 --> 37:19.400
Come and get me now.
You serenity stealers.

37:19.680 --> 37:22.514
All you need to handle
any situation in life.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.036
Are the Warrior One and
Warrior Two positions. girls.

37:25.320 --> 37:26.436
Okay?

37:26.760 --> 37:29.753
Master those and you will master
anyone who gives you shit.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.760
Now let's go Lotus for
our closing meditation.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.839
Yoga teaches us to take
what the universe gives.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.918
And what?

37:38.200 --> 37:39.554
- Colleen C.: Embrace it?
- Nope.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.275
Fight against it.
You fight against it.

37:42.560 --> 37:46.679
Yoga demands that we grab
the universe by the throat

37:46.960 --> 37:49.395
and we just choke it until
it bends to our will.

37:49.680 --> 37:52.434
We inflict yoga on our enemies
until they join us in peace.

37:52.720 --> 37:55.394
Always be peaceful change girls.

37:55.680 --> 37:58.434
But if you have to. you destroy
everything that threatens

37:58.720 --> 38:01.189
anyone or anything that you
love by hook or by crook.

38:01.480 --> 38:04.120
That's the yoga way.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.357
Wow.

38:06.640 --> 38:08.791
Please join me
in a final prayer.

38:09.080 --> 38:12.437
Yoga Fett. Yoga Fett.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.434
Yoga Fett. Yoga Fett.
Yoga Fett.

38:15.760 --> 38:19.993
Yoga Fett. Yoga Fett.

38:20.280 --> 38:24.638
And sorry not sorry.
Confetti feel.

38:26.240 --> 38:27.754
Radio Host:
Caller. go ahead.

38:28.040 --> 38:31.192
Oh. hey Bob, big fan
and a first time caller...

38:31.480 --> 38:35.360
Hey. pack of True North Menthol.

38:38.640 --> 38:39.640
Those are lights.

38:39.800 --> 38:42.713
Sorry aboot that.

38:44.200 --> 38:49.229
You know girls.
That's just not very Canadian.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.151
C'mon Robin.
Let's get out of here.

38:54.440 --> 38:59.196
When is one's
virginity technically lost?

39:00.880 --> 39:02.519
Like when what is the process

39:02.800 --> 39:04.439
when you're going
through the sex process

39:04.720 --> 39:07.110
of losing virginity.
That process?

39:07.440 --> 39:10.433
How can one come out at
the end and then say like...

39:16.240 --> 39:18.232
- Hunter's calling.
- So answer.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.075
Hello?

39:23.360 --> 39:25.272
Colleen McKenzie!

39:25.560 --> 39:27.040
Hunter.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.320
Where you at?

39:28.600 --> 39:32.310
You're missing a killer
grade 12 party over here.

39:32.640 --> 39:35.314
Please don't hate us. but we
got called into work tonight.

39:35.640 --> 39:36.640
That sucks.

39:36.760 --> 39:37.876
Yeah. it really sucks.

39:38.160 --> 39:40.550
Because there's like.
Nobody here tonight either.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.196
- Holy shit.

39:43.520 --> 39:44.795
What?

39:45.080 --> 39:50.360
We could have a
party right here.

39:54.360 --> 39:56.556
Hunter. Hello.
This is Colleen C.

39:56.840 --> 39:58.856
We unfortunately cannot make
it to your party tonight

39:58.880 --> 40:00.837
but we want to invite
you to another party...

40:01.160 --> 40:02.160
At Eh-2-Zed.

40:04.680 --> 40:07.149
Hold on. this shit's loud,
let me go in the bedroom

40:07.440 --> 40:08.999
so I can hear.

40:09.280 --> 40:12.159
Ah ha. sweet.
Sweet dude.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.671
You want me to bring
the party to you guys?

40:16.960 --> 40:20.112
Won't your dad flip if we're
drinkin' beers in the 'Zed?

40:20.400 --> 40:21.834
Oh. don't you worry aboot that.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.635
My dad's long gone in Niagara
Falls with the store manager.

40:24.920 --> 40:28.152
And bring beers.
We don't have any booze here.

40:28.480 --> 40:30.551
Did you say boobs?

40:30.840 --> 40:32.513
Colleen M.: Booze-uh.
Booze-uh.

40:32.800 --> 40:35.440
What time should
we head to the Zed?

40:35.720 --> 40:37.439
Colleen M.: Nine o'clock?

40:37.720 --> 40:39.598
Perfect. We'll be there.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.639
- And I can't wait...

40:41.920 --> 40:43.274
to see you. Colleen M.

40:43.560 --> 40:46.473
Show you what I'm
really all aboot.

40:48.320 --> 40:52.314
What the hell was that?

40:53.280 --> 40:54.714
Here we go.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.196
Going to the Zed
again is so stupid.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.958
Sorry.

41:02.240 --> 41:05.631
Now. follow me on this. Gordon.

41:05.920 --> 41:09.834
These girls just gift-wrapped
themselves for us.

41:10.120 --> 41:12.999
We were gonna have
to dig shallow graves

41:13.320 --> 41:16.233
after we cut 'em up.
Now we're goin' to their store.

41:16.520 --> 41:19.957
We kill 'em in the store.
Shit, we can take our time,

41:20.280 --> 41:22.511
do it right.

41:22.800 --> 41:25.634
We can leave their bodies
right between the Pucky Charms

41:25.960 --> 41:27.280
and the Chug-a-lugs.

41:27.560 --> 41:30.075
And all we gotta do is take
the money from the register.

41:30.360 --> 41:31.953
Break some shit
on the way oot...

41:32.240 --> 41:34.630
And make it look like a
failed robbery gone bad. eh?

41:34.960 --> 41:39.432
These stupid sophomore bitches
want to have a party at the Zed?

41:39.760 --> 41:42.434
- We'll give 'em a party
at the Zed.

41:42.760 --> 41:45.320
Their farewell party. yo.

41:52.480 --> 41:53.936
Colleen M.: Where should I kiss
Hunter tonight?

41:53.960 --> 41:55.360
Ew. lips only.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.472
I mean. in the store?

41:57.760 --> 42:00.832
Keep it tasteful. McKenzie. Don't
whore him on the first date.

42:01.160 --> 42:02.799
Casual. not contrived.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.120
You give the best advice.

42:04.240 --> 42:06.197
You're my best friend
in the whole world.

42:06.480 --> 42:07.960
Aw. you're mine.

42:10.600 --> 42:11.670
Hear that?

42:12.000 --> 42:14.310
That's our destiny
knocking at the backdoor.

42:23.880 --> 42:24.880
Hi.

42:25.080 --> 42:29.313
Ladies. we are here to
cordially accept your invitation

42:29.640 --> 42:30.790
to party hardy.

42:31.080 --> 42:32.080
We?

42:32.360 --> 42:33.680
Party. yeah!

42:33.960 --> 42:34.960
What's he doing here?

42:35.200 --> 42:38.318
And where's everybody else?

42:40.200 --> 42:42.112
Hmm. where's everybody else?

42:42.400 --> 42:44.756
Well. when I made
the other seniors

42:45.080 --> 42:47.117
the same very generous
offer you made me

42:47.400 --> 42:48.754
to move the party here.

42:49.080 --> 42:51.470
Yeah. they all laughed at you.

42:51.760 --> 42:53.877
Tonya Simmons said. and I quote.

42:54.160 --> 42:56.072
"A party at the scummy Eh-2-Zed

42:56.360 --> 42:58.397
with those two little
girls from honors history?

42:58.720 --> 43:00.234
No way. eh?"

43:00.520 --> 43:02.398
"I'd rather kiss
Gordon Greenleaf."

43:02.720 --> 43:03.995
I'd rather kiss...

43:04.280 --> 43:05.280
She didn't say that. man.

43:05.560 --> 43:07.392
She was thinkin' it.

43:07.720 --> 43:10.679
Anyways. I've never
been much of a follower.

43:10.960 --> 43:13.555
So I left all
those losers behind

43:13.840 --> 43:15.797
and came here to
hang with you two.

43:17.520 --> 43:19.239
You left your own party?

43:19.520 --> 43:21.352
Parties are basic.
This is better.

43:21.640 --> 43:23.996
This is what they call in
the states. a kickback.

43:24.320 --> 43:25.320
States. Eh?

43:25.440 --> 43:27.796
And. I brought Gordon
so Colleen C. would have

43:28.120 --> 43:31.636
someone to talk to while
little Miss Colleen M. gives me

43:31.960 --> 43:33.872
a private tour.

43:40.600 --> 43:42.398
Looks like it's just us. eh?

43:42.720 --> 43:46.680
Maybe we should form
the Just Us League?

43:46.960 --> 43:48.394
A little kickback hookup.

43:48.720 --> 43:51.474
Yeah... heh.

43:53.240 --> 43:57.473
So this is the
Eh-2-Zed backroom. again.

44:03.960 --> 44:05.519
Epic.

44:05.800 --> 44:07.678
Colleen and I call
it the Highway to Hell.

44:07.960 --> 44:09.633
'Cause Eh-2-Zed's right
through that door.

44:09.920 --> 44:12.276
And Eh-2-Zed's
pretty much our hell.

44:12.560 --> 44:14.472
Highway to Hell?

44:14.760 --> 44:16.479
Mm-Hmm.

44:17.240 --> 44:18.993
Wow.

44:19.440 --> 44:23.195
Devil talk always
gives me goosebumps.

44:23.480 --> 44:23.992
Oh?

44:24.280 --> 44:25.555
See?

44:26.640 --> 44:28.359
See?

44:28.680 --> 44:30.194
Yeah.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.550
You believe in Satan?

44:34.840 --> 44:37.674
I used to believe in Santa.
Does that count?

44:45.200 --> 44:47.271
So basic.

44:47.560 --> 44:48.755
Mmmmm.

44:50.240 --> 44:53.472
Me and Gordon
are way into Satan.

44:53.760 --> 44:54.760
Ooh.

44:54.800 --> 44:58.237
Kind of like how you and
Colleen are way into yoga.

44:58.520 --> 45:00.159
Or your band?

45:00.440 --> 45:01.157
Yeah.

45:01.440 --> 45:05.354
Now. the good news is that
we're Canadian Satanists.

45:05.680 --> 45:08.798
So we don't go in for
any of that touchy stuff.

45:09.080 --> 45:11.800
Your virtue stays intact.

45:12.080 --> 45:13.992
It's gotta.
You know why?

45:14.280 --> 45:15.316
Why?

45:15.640 --> 45:18.951
You see.
Satan seeks his souls pure.

45:19.240 --> 45:22.472
And there are no virgins
in grade 12.

45:22.760 --> 45:24.797
- Mm-hmm.
- All the virgins are in grade 10.

45:25.080 --> 45:28.039
Well. I've just been
waiting for the right person.

45:28.360 --> 45:29.953
In the right place.

45:30.280 --> 45:33.910
You are so adorable. McKenzie.
You think I want your body?

45:34.240 --> 45:37.119
I don't want your body.

45:37.400 --> 45:41.872
I just want your untouched.
Virgin soul.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.196
Okay.

45:43.480 --> 45:47.156
But. well,
the shit sandwich of it all,

45:49.720 --> 45:53.350
I kinda gotta cut
you open to get to it.

45:54.760 --> 45:55.876
Oh.

45:56.160 --> 45:58.436
You know. I'll be right back.
Just one sec.

45:58.720 --> 45:59.720
Colleen!

46:01.400 --> 46:03.835
I thank you for your sacrifice.
Colleen M.

46:04.120 --> 46:06.840
Every pure soul I give to
Satan brings me one step closer

46:07.120 --> 46:11.956
to meeting the beast
and that's gonna be so metal.

46:15.920 --> 46:16.920
What the hell's that?

46:17.160 --> 46:19.436
That's my mom's date knife
pointed at your balls.

46:21.160 --> 46:22.160
Okay.

46:22.200 --> 46:24.431
Is that enough metal for you.
Or do you want more?

46:24.760 --> 46:27.514
Oh. no. no. no, no.
Can we talk aboot this?

46:27.840 --> 46:28.478
Talk to The Mohel.

46:28.800 --> 46:29.870
Okay. okay.

46:30.160 --> 46:32.117
Put the knife down. pretty boy.

46:32.400 --> 46:37.634
- Okay. knife's down.

46:41.080 --> 46:42.720
I guess I got a little
carried away there.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
Sorry aboot that.

46:45.200 --> 46:47.999
And I was gonna let
you get to second base.

46:53.160 --> 46:55.152
There's something inside of me.

46:57.080 --> 47:00.960
- Are you okay?
- Help me.

47:12.800 --> 47:14.154
Oh my god!

47:14.440 --> 47:16.397
Wunderbar!

47:17.960 --> 47:19.633
Colleen?

47:20.440 --> 47:22.636
Colleen?

47:22.920 --> 47:24.991
Here we go.

47:25.320 --> 47:26.913
Colleen?

47:28.000 --> 47:29.832
Colleen?

47:30.960 --> 47:31.996
McKenzie?

47:39.000 --> 47:41.151
Gordon. please.
Stop begging. okay?

47:41.440 --> 47:42.715
You are not getting any.

47:43.040 --> 47:44.235
My ass.

47:44.520 --> 47:46.840
Gordon. I swear to God. If you
puke. you're cleaning it up.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.080
Somethin' just
crawled up in my ass!

47:52.080 --> 47:54.037
Is this what happens
when you smoke weed?

47:59.160 --> 48:00.958
Oh no!

48:08.680 --> 48:10.672
Oh my god.

48:15.400 --> 48:17.198
Uh. Colleen?

48:18.280 --> 48:21.239
Wunderbar!

48:31.600 --> 48:32.272
Hey.

48:32.560 --> 48:34.677
What the hell was that?

48:35.480 --> 48:38.234
Nein. Nein. Nein. nein.

48:39.280 --> 48:40.280
Nein.

48:40.520 --> 48:43.354
- Sh... Sheisse!
- Oh hell no!

48:46.800 --> 48:49.838
- Shut up. - Nein! - Shut up!

48:52.680 --> 48:55.912
Nein. Nein. Nein!

48:56.240 --> 48:59.597
- Nein. Nein. Nein. nein, nein!

49:00.920 --> 49:02.354
Auf wiedersehen.

49:09.320 --> 49:11.277
Did you know Hunter Calloway
was religious?

49:15.080 --> 49:18.198
Oh you piece of shit!

49:20.840 --> 49:22.911
Shut up!

49:23.200 --> 49:25.237
- Pull.
- Ew. no.

49:25.560 --> 49:27.950
- Pull!
- Okay. okay, okay, okay.

49:30.200 --> 49:32.954
Nein stretchy. Nein stretchy!

49:36.320 --> 49:38.551
Uhh.. Ah.

49:39.360 --> 49:43.718
Ahh... Ahhh.

49:44.840 --> 49:47.480
Mein kampf.

49:58.360 --> 49:59.635
Security lights.

50:01.960 --> 50:03.155
911. eh?

50:03.440 --> 50:05.400
Hello? We're being attacked
by little sausage men.

50:05.480 --> 50:06.576
With concentrated
sauerkraut for blood.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.512
That look like Adolf Hitler.
Go.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.234
Oh. Hitler. eh?

50:10.560 --> 50:12.153
Well. he sure is a nasty camper.

50:12.480 --> 50:15.632
Worse than Dr. Doom and
Darth Vader combined.

50:15.920 --> 50:17.400
Yeah. boy.

50:17.680 --> 50:18.680
Shut up. old man.

50:18.960 --> 50:20.416
Send a bunch of cops to the
Eh-2-Zed on Portage and Wayne

50:20.440 --> 50:21.896
- and bring some body bags.
- Little ones.

50:21.920 --> 50:23.115
Hurry!

50:23.400 --> 50:25.915
- Hello? Hello?

50:26.240 --> 50:28.072
Goddamned yoga hosers.

Wunderbar.

50:36.360 --> 50:37.635
Man.

We've got wieners.

50:41.440 --> 50:44.160
Check over there.

50:44.800 --> 50:49.431
- Wunderbar!

50:49.960 --> 50:50.996
Seriously?

50:53.000 --> 50:54.354
Sausage party.

50:54.640 --> 50:55.760
I don't wanna die in Canada!

50:56.000 --> 50:57.320
We're not gonna die in Canada.

50:57.600 --> 51:00.798
- There's no other way oot!
- There's always another way.

51:01.080 --> 51:01.752
The Yoga Way.

51:02.040 --> 51:03.520
- The Yoga Way?
- The Yoga Way.

51:04.840 --> 51:07.309
Okay. Warrior One.

51:07.600 --> 51:09.040
- Hold it. McKenzie. Hold it.
- Okay.

51:09.080 --> 51:11.390
Warrior Two. back to back.

51:11.920 --> 51:13.274
Das frauleins!

51:14.080 --> 51:16.356
Now. on Warrior Three.
We yoga the shit out of these

51:16.640 --> 51:18.359
- bratwurst bitches. Okay?
- Okay.

51:18.640 --> 51:19.640
Warrior three.

51:26.680 --> 51:30.196
I'm not even supposed
to be here today!

51:32.280 --> 51:33.280
Schnell!

51:33.480 --> 51:34.072
Nein! Nein! Nein!

51:34.400 --> 51:35.834
- Sheisse!

51:36.720 --> 51:39.952
- Take off!
- Nein. Wunderbar!

51:42.760 --> 51:43.760
Thank you.

51:47.040 --> 51:48.633
Yo.

51:48.920 --> 51:50.400
Slapshot.

51:54.520 --> 51:56.432
I've got aboot 10 left.

51:57.320 --> 51:59.073
Colleen M.:
I've got aboot the same.

51:59.360 --> 52:02.353
Then let's drop that puck. Go!

52:37.680 --> 52:40.832
Nein! Nein! Nein!

52:43.080 --> 52:45.436
Wow.

52:47.400 --> 52:49.551
Freeze.
Hands up. Hands up.

52:49.840 --> 52:52.150
Officer 2: Don't you move.
You goddamn yoga hosers!

52:52.480 --> 52:54.358
RCMP. freeze.

52:54.680 --> 52:55.955
Colleen M.: This is
so basic.

52:56.240 --> 52:58.072
This is beyond basic.

53:06.360 --> 53:07.794
- So basic.
- Shh.

53:12.800 --> 53:13.800
Stop it.
I'm itchy.

53:14.120 --> 53:15.236
Stop it.

53:18.840 --> 53:22.197
All right. C'mon. c'mon, c'mon.

53:23.560 --> 53:26.040
All right. You got aboot ten
minutes before the RCMP come back.

53:26.320 --> 53:28.710
I'll try to stall 'em
as long as I can.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.071
You know. thank you
very much for doing this.

53:31.360 --> 53:33.317
I cannot know how to
repay you for this.

53:33.640 --> 53:37.395
No. No. Thank you.
Look. this book, is my bible.

53:37.680 --> 53:41.515
And you're like a goddamn
Canadian Batman. Eh?

53:41.800 --> 53:44.440
Oh. That is so touching.
I cannot believe.

53:44.720 --> 53:45.720
I'll stall for a second.

53:54.200 --> 54:01.915
Um. I thought that maybe
you might need a stiff drink.

54:02.480 --> 54:04.995
You saw my mom?
Where is she?

54:05.280 --> 54:09.832
Well. she's out there and she's
trying to post bail. You know.

54:10.320 --> 54:14.075
Your father. who's name
I think is Bob Collette.

54:14.360 --> 54:17.876
They are having a heck of a time
getting in touch with that man.

54:18.160 --> 54:19.799
He's in Niagara Falls.

54:20.080 --> 54:23.118
The RCMP will not let your mommy

54:23.440 --> 54:28.515
bail you out of here
because the RCMP don't ever let.

54:28.800 --> 54:31.156
Eh. serial killers out on bail.

54:31.440 --> 54:34.512
And they're saying
that you are both

54:34.800 --> 54:38.077
the serial killers
because you killeded those...

54:38.360 --> 54:40.716
Those eh. two boys, you know.

54:41.040 --> 54:43.316
You killed the absolute
shit out of them.

54:43.600 --> 54:45.080
But we didn't kill the boys.

54:45.360 --> 54:46.510
We didn't kill anybody.

54:46.840 --> 54:47.840
They were gonna kill us.

54:48.120 --> 54:49.713
- They were devil worshipers.
- Yeah.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.836
I don't really know much about
the devil. but there we go.

54:56.560 --> 54:58.995
Somebody sure put their poop-holes
through hell. You know?

54:59.280 --> 55:02.512
We didn't do this.

55:02.800 --> 55:04.632
Who did then?

55:04.920 --> 55:06.479
It was the Bratzis.

55:06.760 --> 55:08.513
Bratzis?

55:08.800 --> 55:11.679
I want to know what this
Bratzi is. What is a Bratzi?

55:11.960 --> 55:14.376
It's like a foot-tall Canadian
Nazi and it's made of Bratwurst.

55:14.400 --> 55:15.856
They have concentrated
sauerkraut for blood.

55:15.880 --> 55:18.270
And they dress like
Mountie Beaver stuffies.

55:18.560 --> 55:21.280
Are you guys tripping
on the pot?

55:21.800 --> 55:26.750
I mean do you even hear
how crazy that sounds?

55:27.360 --> 55:32.480
Yes. So I go down
to the old Eh-2-Zed

55:33.280 --> 55:35.749
and I will look around myself.
You know?

55:36.040 --> 55:42.150
Guy Lapointe style. and you
want to know what I believe now?

55:42.480 --> 55:44.472
What?

55:44.760 --> 55:49.516
- I believe that I believe you.

55:49.800 --> 55:50.995
You saw them?

55:51.320 --> 55:53.471
Yeah.
I saw only this. You know.

55:53.760 --> 55:58.551
It was buried in a wad of cheese
at the back of the microwave.

55:58.840 --> 56:01.116
I found this.

56:04.880 --> 56:06.439
What's this?

56:06.720 --> 56:11.875
This is a land purchase
agreement signed in 1939

56:12.160 --> 56:14.720
by the self-proclaimed
Canadian Fuhrer.

56:15.000 --> 56:19.950
Adrien Arcand.

56:20.240 --> 56:24.314
For 100 acres in the Winnipegs.

56:24.640 --> 56:29.396
On this now sits a little
store that could be

56:29.680 --> 56:33.720
very near and dear to
your hearts. I think so.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.231
- Lulu Lemon?
- He's talking about the Zed.

56:36.520 --> 56:37.590
Oh.

56:37.880 --> 56:41.112
Canadian Nazis were
the original land owners

56:41.400 --> 56:45.633
of that piece of land
where that store is now.

56:45.960 --> 56:52.070
And it is my theory that these
horrific monsters never left.

56:53.680 --> 56:59.039
That's why I need both of
you to help me solve this

56:59.320 --> 57:04.190
quite queer case
of the untold tale

57:04.520 --> 57:09.311
buried beneath the
Canadian convenience store.

57:09.600 --> 57:11.956
Which is probably what I
should call the book. I think.

57:12.280 --> 57:15.591
Okay. so.
When do we get out of here?

57:15.880 --> 57:18.315
We don't get out of here. I do.

57:18.600 --> 57:21.240
You don't.
Because you're in the jail.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.037
- Right?

57:25.320 --> 57:27.360
I'm gonna speak to this
fool in French for a second.

57:28.240 --> 57:30.709
Excuse me.

57:31.040 --> 57:33.316
I can get you
inside the Eh-2-Zed.

57:33.600 --> 57:36.832
As you said. I can get
myself inside the Eh-2-Zed

57:37.120 --> 57:41.433
quite easily. little kitty cat
woman smarty pantsies.

57:41.760 --> 57:44.753
But you need me to show you
the secret passageway.

57:46.200 --> 57:50.797
She's saying that I need her
for the secret passageway.

57:51.080 --> 57:53.515
What secret passageway?

57:53.800 --> 57:55.712
The Colleen who
doesn't speak the French

57:56.000 --> 57:58.799
has never heard
of the passageway.

57:59.120 --> 58:00.840
My Dad showed
only me the secret passageway.

58:01.120 --> 58:02.520
And I'll take you there.

58:02.800 --> 58:04.678
But you have to
get us out of here.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.832
Understand?

58:07.160 --> 58:09.391
Shit...

58:11.840 --> 58:14.150
That means shit.

58:39.880 --> 58:42.475
Aw it's Hunter's chalk line.

58:43.120 --> 58:44.679
Ew.

58:45.320 --> 58:47.118
Maybe we should Instagram it.

58:47.400 --> 58:48.470
Ooh. right?

58:48.760 --> 58:51.116
Uh. Mr. Lapointe?
Can we have our phones back now?

58:56.040 --> 58:58.953
You want your phones?

58:59.240 --> 59:01.800
No. I didn't steal your phones.

59:02.080 --> 59:03.560
You didn't get our phones?

59:03.840 --> 59:07.675
Do you mean that when I was illegally
breaking you out of the jail

59:07.960 --> 59:10.395
that I forgot to steal your
precious telephones.

59:10.680 --> 59:12.000
Is that what you're
trying to say?

59:12.280 --> 59:15.034
Well. I'm sorry I'm so selfish.

59:15.360 --> 59:16.396
Right?

59:16.680 --> 59:18.273
How can I ever
make it up to you?

59:18.560 --> 59:21.632
Well. you can start by letting us
change out of these prison rags.

59:21.920 --> 59:23.912
Yeah. they make us look fat.

59:24.240 --> 59:26.550
You listen to me.
You Lady Gagas.

59:26.840 --> 59:29.560
You know that this is
not a photograph shoot

59:29.840 --> 59:31.593
for the Canadian Vogue.

59:31.920 --> 59:34.719
And I did not bring
for you wardrobe styles

59:35.040 --> 59:37.176
with all that frilly business.
So what would you like to do?

59:37.200 --> 59:39.760
Well. We have our Yoga
clothes and backup smocks

59:40.040 --> 59:42.120
in the bathroom. can we at
least go change into that?

59:42.160 --> 59:43.520
Yeah. and I'll take that
over this.

59:43.600 --> 59:46.672
Orange is the New Black
bullshit any day.

59:46.960 --> 59:48.679
You have one Manitoban minute.

59:48.960 --> 59:51.873
And then you will show me
the secret passage way.

59:52.160 --> 59:54.072
So you must hurry up.

59:54.400 --> 59:57.279
Hey. oh whoa.
No poopie stuff.

59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.997
Ew.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:04.040
Okay. Colleen. seriously,
why didn't you tell me about

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.317
this secret passageway?
That's so cool.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.796
Seriously. there is
no secret passageway.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.880
I'm pretty sure there
is a secret passageway.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:11.960
You said there was.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.960
I'm pretty sure I only said that to
get us oot of jail. Colleen. God.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.416
If we don't prove the Bratzis exist.
We're going away for murder.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:20.360
Colleen M.: But what do
we do aboot Guy Lapointe?

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.056
Colleen C.: I don't know.
Colleen. I guess it's time

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.311
to tell him there
is no secret passageway.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.431
Oh!

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.990
- Das boo!

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.235
Oh. you're awake.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.520
Wunderbar. Wunderbar.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:26.517
Wunderbar. Wunderbar.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.877
Bratzis. no?

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.230
Bratzis.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.000
I would like to welcome you.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:35.194
To my Canadian
Subterranean Stronghold.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:39.236
Located 37 feet below
the surface of Winnipeg.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.480
Und I am Andronicus Arcane.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.320
That's that guy Ms. Maurice
told us aboot in Honors History.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:47.636
The man from Berlin?

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.674
Poof. He disappeared.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.960
Poop?

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.032
Yah. frauleins.
I am from Berlin.

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.357
This is why I have
an accent that sounds

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.519
both scary und creepy.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.191
So in an effort to make
our future communications

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.075
less spooky and more friendly.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.795
I will now be speaking
only in the voice

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:12.437
of American movie star.
Al Pacino.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.514
I bet all you need
are the dulcet tones

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.396
of one of Hollywood's
greatest living actors.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.592
Hoowah.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.839
Do you know what. that's not
a half-bad Al Pacino there.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.634
Thank you.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.355
- Who?
- Al Pacino.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.190
Al Pacino. he was
an American president?

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.675
- Oh.
- Geez.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.357
You see. the Third Reich
imprisoned me here

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.156
inside this Canadian
Subterranean Stronghold.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:51.356
To build a clone army
that would conquer Canada

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.230
and the
United States of America.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.789
Hoowah.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:00.596
I used my own DNA and
made the clone bodies from

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.955
the finest bratwurst and sauerkraut
direct from Deutschland.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.472
So in 1945. I initiated

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.832
the 100 year-long
incubation process.

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.757
And I put myself on ice.
In a cryogenic chamber,

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:21.118
timed to wake up when my
little wiener babies

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.518
were full-grown clones.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.877
But 70 years later...

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.277
We've got real def. rhythms.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.152
And fresh new jams.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.476
You say we got egos...

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.951
The little Colleens
would change everything

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.358
simply by singin' a song.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.919
Goddamn it. Ichabod.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.720
How much did you plug
into that socket?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.920
You told me to plug
everything into that soocket.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.231
We're 14 years old. Ichabod.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.399
Yeah. what are we supposed
to know about physics. Ichabod?

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.832
You guys wouldn't talk to me this
way if I was covered in tattoos.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.880
The power outage in
the Eh-2-Zed that night.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.511
Shorted out my ancient Canadian
Subterranean Generator.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:12.796
So I woke up prematurely
from my cryogenic slumber.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:18.760
But the incubation process
had also been interrupted...

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.835
Papa.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.875
Forever stunting the growth
of my wiener babies.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.709
My life's work was a failure.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.158
Hoowah.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.234
That's so sad.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.432
Yeah. maybe it would be
less sad coming from

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.679
American tough guy.
Sylvester Stallone.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.629
So. you know.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:46.953
Even though making
clones was my life's work.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:50.039
It wasn't my passion. you know?

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.840
Colleen C.:
This guy sounds like Groot.

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:55.079
No. he was being
Sylvester Stallone.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.114
Who?

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:00.837
So. anyway,
before I got into science

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.396
and before the war.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:06.235
And then before I met
Adrien Arcand. I was like.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:07.755
"Yo. Adrien."

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.636
Adrian was the wife in the
movie of the Rocky Rambo.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.877
He's very good.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:17.312
And before the Nazi
No-good-nicks took over my life.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.240
I was an artist. you know?

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.671
And my art was sculpting.
You know.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.519
I'd chip away at the marble

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.553
until it was beautiful to me.
You know?

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.479
I loved being an artist.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.956
Except for one thing.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.391
I'm talkin' about the
goddamned critics. you know?

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.310
They told me I had no talent.
They told me I stink on ice.

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:41.435
They're so negative and hurtful.
They cut me. man.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.056
They drove me away from doing
the thing I really love to do.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.595
Ya know. being who I am.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:50.556
That's when I found
Adrien Arcand and Canadian Nazis

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:54.197
and. you know, Hitler.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.954
Oh.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.280
Right?

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.155
You know that this man is
not a puppy on the internet?

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.353
Maybe my Stallone
is too aggressive

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:06.439
I will switch to a Hollywood
impression that is less threatening.

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.038
So. I didn't want to be

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:11.560
a Nazi for the rest of my life.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:16.391
The exit tunnel of my Canadian
Subterranean Stronghold

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:18.956
got me to the backroom
of the Eh-2-Zed.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:23.280
And one night. after closing.
I took my first steps

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.273
into a brave new world.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.197
So. every night
after the store closed,

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.910
I would make myself at home
in the Eh-2-Zed backroom.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.237
Where I learned to speak
English and do voices.

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.871
By watching every
single thing on Netflix.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.032
I'll be...

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.360
I'll be back.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.593
And I discovered that this
modern world worships popular.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.200
Arts and entertainment.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.392
I'll be back. I'll...

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.194
So, for the past six months.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.278
I've been sculpting again.
Don't ya know?

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:57.634
Sculpting up a storm with the help
of my wicked little wiener babies.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.520
Wunderbar!

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:04.470
May I present the debut of
my first new work in decades.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:08.111
It's a sculpture
celebrating my beloved

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.960
adopted home of Canada.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:15.359
I call it. the Goalie Golem.

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:27.711
So. what does everybody think?

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.276
Well. I will tell you

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.395
that this giant Canada man
is very bold.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.319
And it's a real statement.
You know?

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:40.272
Mm-hmm.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.554
It captures perfectly
that kind of essence

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.270
of the True North. you know.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.319
Oh. thank you.

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.029
But it also captures the
actual people that you killed

01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:56.073
in the sculpture as well.
Regrettably.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:57.435
Hmm.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.600
So I'm thinking that we should
all be very afraid right now.

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:04.631
But. Mr. Lapointe,
you and the Colleens

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.752
were never in any jeopardy.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.350
You see. I brought the
Colleens here to help me.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.792
I have a need for their
very specialized skills.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.917
Um. I don't mean to be mean.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:17.112
But I don't know
who this is either.

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:18.629
Rats.

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.475
Do you want to try doing
someone we might recognize?

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.234
Hmm.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.115
Uh. do you know the actor
who played the Batman?

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:27.959
I can do him too.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.595
You see girls. each night
as I slaved away

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:37.874
over my masterpiece.
One dream fueled me.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.152
Uh. that does not
sound like Batman.

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:42.392
Yeah. Batman sounds like...

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:45.194
Where's the trigger?
Uhh.

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:47.038
Where's the trigger?

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:51.513
Uh. where's the trigger?

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.598
Uh...

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:57.669
No you don't understand.
He's doing the original.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.913
The real Batman from the
televisions. Adam West's Batman.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.350
- Wasn't it?
- Yes.

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.040
It's supposed to sound like...

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.312
Uh. where's the trigger. Joker?

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.115
Uh uh.
Where's the trigger?

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.520
Do you know he never once
said that line to the Joker.

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:12.560
So just stop it.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.990
The only thing I've dreamed
of for the past six months

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.797
is looking at a photograph
of me standing proudly

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.393
next to my sculpture on the
"Famous People are Just Like You"

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:27.673
page of Them Weekly magazine.

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.952
Oh my god. he reads it too!

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.714
Isn't that page. like, the best?

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.630
One time. they showed
Harry Styles buying bacon.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:44.272
- It was so hot.
- It was so hot.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:49.635
And this is my Harry Styles
buying bacon moment.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.400
Now you are pleased
to photograph me

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.280
for Them Weekly magazine.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.234
You're kidding!

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.559
You're never going to believe
this. Mr. Old Man. but

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.878
we don't have our phones.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:17.956
What?
Nein. nein. nein. nein, nein.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.550
So much nein it's almost 10.

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:23.639
How can this be? You always
have with the phones.

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.553
The cops took our phones.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.515
Surely you must have a phone.
Herr Guy.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.672
My phone has no camera.

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.474
What the fudge?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.799
So. nobody has a camera.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:41.438
I guess we have to go directly
to phase two of my master plan.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.110
Fly my pretties,
Fly! C'mon.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.440
Wunderbar!

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.877
That's right. yes.
Wiener babies, let's go!

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.520
C'mon. c'mon.

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:58.191
Let's all go to the lobby.
Let's all go to the lobby.

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:00.159
Whoa.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.274
They're just following orders.
That's all they're doing.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:07.952
And okay for you. Mr. Straggler.
Now you inside there.

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:16.069
Now. my wiener babies.
Bring mein art to life.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:19.797
Rise. rise!

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.320
Rise!

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.717
Yeah that's what I'm
talkin' about. baby!

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.433
- Wow.
- Wow.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.349
That's the same thing that.

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.200
Them Weekly magazine
is gonna feel

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:37.914
when they see this baby.

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.559
For tonight he is going to
start his bloody rampage

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:44.479
across the True North.

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:49.437
Killing every art critic
in Canada.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.200
What?

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.793
Go my Goalie Golem.

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:58.791
Go kill the critics and all
the haters that gotta hate.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.470
Oh. I hate those haters.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:04.514
- You can't let him do this.
- You've gotta stop him.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.599
Let me just hang on a minute.
Let's...

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:11.112
He's not talking about
killing real people.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.035
He's just talking
about killing critics.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.635
Mr. Lapointe!

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:18.116
Let it go!
Use the ladder!

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.153
- Go my Goalie Golem!

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
- We can do this.
- Yeah.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.240
We don't need his help.

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.936
We do tons of stupid
stuff without adults.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.400
- Both: All the time.
- All the time.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.592
It's just a bunch of
Bratzis in a giant suit.

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.960
And we beat a bunch of Bratzis before.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.720
Okay but what are we gonna do
aboot Guy Lapointeless over here?

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.834
This epic fail?

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.994
Unhand me. Unhand!

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:44.360
Okay all we have to
do is do every yoga pose.

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.989
Yogi Bayer ever taught us.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:47.316
That's your plan?

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:51.031
What in the heck did your
yogurt instructor teach you?

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.280
He taught us to destroy
everything that threatens

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.791
anything and anyone you love.
By hook or by crook.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.391
And that's the Yoga Way.
Frenchie. Let's go.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.551
Wunderbar. wunderbar, wunderbar!

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.557
Hey Bratzi Party.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.718
We wanna have a Weenie Roast.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:12.240
Wunderbar!

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.196
Nein. Das frauleins!

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:25.480
Wunderbar. Wunderbar.
Wunderbar...

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.555
Nein. nein, nein,
nein, nein, nein.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:32.117
You're objective is not
the Colleens. it's the critics.

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.399
- Golem: Nein wunderbar?
- Nein wunderbar.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.149
This is all bad.
This is all wrong.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.033
I give you two thumbs down.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.477
Das frauleins.

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:46.515
As your maker. I command
you to crush all the critics

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.519
and the negative peoples

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.632
and the haters who
gotta hate. hate, hate.

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.360
Mein heiny.

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.438
What you waiting for?
Haha..

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:58.037
I command you to kill a
negative critic right now!

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.118
Okey dokey. Papa.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.720
Oh. sheisse.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.834
They just killed their dad.

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:19.120
Wunderbar. wunderbar,
wunderbar...

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.552
All right. I'd say
we got his attention.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:24.840
Boss stage. biotch.

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.595
Wunderbar!

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:28.950
Warrior one!

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.277
Now. warrior two, back to back.

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.438
Okay. now warrior three...

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.599
We crush King Koopa
and save Princess Peach.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:41.472
Yeah okay.
Warrior three!

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:51.432
- Shit!

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.674
- Atlas Shrugged!

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:54.996
- Atlas Shrugged!

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.520
Dissatisfied customer!

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.156
"I don't like the
product you've given me!"

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.400
So. this is yoga.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.510
Warrior Two!

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.029
- Yoga Fett?
- Yoga Fett.

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:16.792
Yoga Fett.
Yoga Fett. Yoga Fett. Yoga Fett.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.195
Basic. right?

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.880
So basic.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.236
Ah schwein!

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.280
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.029
- Are you okay?
- It's been a long night.

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.834
Hey!

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:39.158
You big bear riding a bulldozer!

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:44.032
Wunderbar. Wunderbar.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:47.398
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size huh?

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.754
Wunderbar!

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.520
Don't come to me.

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:58.960
Wunderbar. Wunderbar.
Wunderbar.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.357
Auf wiedersehen!

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.229
Three-legged Dog!

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:08.790
What the...

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.034
Two-Legged Dog.
In a Push Cart.

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:22.910
Mein spine!

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.736
Of all the times not
to have our phones.

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:25.910
Right?

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:39.030
I am so sorry ladies.
But I seem

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.277
to have dropped my
book onto your wiener.

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.592
No, no, no, no, no!

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.776
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
But this is getting ridiculous.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.076
Now you're telling me that
you own Boo Boo Bayers too?

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.039
How can Warner Brothers
own something

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.999
that I just made up last week?

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.320
No. I did!

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.353
Yes. out of my own brain.

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.313
Smarter than what average bear?

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:13.600
No. No. No. I...

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.798
Sorry. sorry, may I speak?
Is it my turn to speak?

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.536
I think you need to
find some inner peace.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.560
Mr. Yelling Lawyer Man.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.552
So why don't you shove
your head up your anus

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:24.236
- and look for it? Namaste.

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.796
Piece of shit.

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.919
Young ladies. Young ladies.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:34.716
Might I just tell you I
am a huge. huge, huge fan.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.673
Out! Get out! Take off!

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.030
- I'm a fan!
- Shoo!

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:38.992
No. No. No. you go!

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:40.736
- Man: What am I. a dog?
- Yogi: Shoo, get going!

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:42.280
- No. go, go!
- But I want to see them!

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:44.640
You're smudging my glass with
your perverted energy. go!

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.638
Sorry aboot that. girls.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:49.360
I'm very incredibly satisfied
by those dissatisfied customers.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.875
No. We don't want it. right?

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.795
And release.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.400
Sorry about that guy.
Yogi Bayer.

01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:57.640
No. No. No. do not be sorry.
That is not the yoga way.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:01.231
In yoga. you're right
and they're wrong.

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.876
Savasana. ladies. Savasana.

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:13.196
You know. I am so
proud of you girls.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.073
You really
legitimized this place

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:17.400
and brought honor to the
sacred strip mall yoga dojo

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:20.792
and a 60 percent increase in
walking traffic to boot!

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.037
My two best pupils.

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.114
Both faced the ultimate
evil. the yoga way.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.114
And you kicked it's
little Nazi assner.

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:32.159
You girls are my kind of
superheroes.

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:32.998
And when I grow up.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.676
I want to be as colossal
as the Colleens.

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:36.960
- Thanks. Yogi.
- Thanks.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.953
Stop it. you're
going to make me cry.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.993
- Phones?

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:44.000
- You're on speaker phone. Dad.
- Hi. Mr. Collette!

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:45.794
You've got work tonight!

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.515
Ooh. Lucky you.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.273
You ready?

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.114
Already have a sign.

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.710
- Oh my god. Colleen!
- What?

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.673
Add another heart!

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:02.600
- Jesus.

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:03.996
- Better?
- Better.

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.396
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:19.071
En Francois!

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.512
Welcome to
Smodcast. I'm Kevin Smith.

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:03.512
Scott Mosier.

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.877
Hey. Scott.
So. from Edmonton.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.160
Good ol' YEG.

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:08.376
A team of police
officers were opening.

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:13.953
- Scott: Open up. Yoga hoser!

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.960
Yoga hoser. Genius.

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:19.038
Do you guys want some twig tea?

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.439
You look like you
could use some.

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:26.791
You look like a poutine eater.

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:30.680
I enjoy a good
poutine now and then?

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:32.736
- Scott: Yeah. who doesn't?
- Kevin: Hey. hey, hey.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.480
Don't engage with this guy.
Damn yoga hoser.

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.392
Don't go down the road with him.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.437
We got a database
of yoga hosers.

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:51.711
You're the termites of Canada.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000
God damn you hosers.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:56.836
Gnawing away at the foundation
of this great country.

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:08.680
With your smoky incense
and your patchouli.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:12.392
It smells like a
Chinese brothel in here!

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:23.071
It's really hard out here
for a yoga hoser. man.

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:26.239
I want to start a podcast.

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:32.896
That's Smodcast for this week.

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.520
- I'm Kevin Smith.
- Scott: Scott Mosier.

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:35.869
Have a week!
