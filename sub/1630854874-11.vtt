>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:36.436 --> 00:38.705
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:38.772 --> 00:41.074
I'M JOHN OLIVER, THANK YOU SO

00:41.141 --> 00:41.574
MUCH FOR JOINING US, AND

00:41.641 --> 00:42.075
NORMALLY, THIS IS WHERE

00:42.142 --> 00:42.675
WE'D DO A QUICK RECAP OF THE

00:42.742 --> 00:44.110
WEEK.

00:44.177 --> 00:45.678
BUT, AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED,

00:45.745 --> 00:49.649
WE'VE BEEN OFF AIR FOR THE LAST

00:49.716 --> 00:50.517
FIVE MONTHS DUE TO THE WRITERS

00:50.583 --> 00:51.851
STRIKE -- WHICH I'M VERY HAPPY

00:51.918 --> 00:52.519
TO SAY IS OVER, AND EVEN HAPPIER

00:52.585 --> 00:54.120
TO SAY WAS SUCCESSFUL.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.122
SO INSTEAD OF RECAPPING THE LAST

00:56.189 --> 00:57.690
WEEK, WE'RE GOING TO START BY

00:57.757 --> 00:58.591
RECAPPING EVERYTHING THAT'S

00:58.658 --> 01:00.527
HAPPENED IN THE LAST FIVE

01:00.593 --> 01:01.961
MONTHS -- WHICH HAS BEEN A LOT.

01:02.028 --> 01:03.096
AND WE'LL BEGIN IN THE U.S.

01:03.163 --> 01:06.499
SENATE WITH THIS:

01:06.566 --> 01:07.267
>> I GOT A NEW STRAP --

01:07.333 --> 01:11.404
STRAP-ON HARNESS TODAY.

01:11.471 --> 01:14.641
I CAN'T WAIT TO PUT IT ON YOU.

01:14.707 --> 01:16.676
IT WILL FIT MY FAVORITE DILDO

01:16.743 --> 01:17.944
PERFECTLY.

01:18.011 --> 01:20.580
YOU'RE GOING TO LOOKO HOT.

01:20.647 --> 01:22.215
I CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE YOUR COCK

01:22.282 --> 01:23.650
IN MY MOUTH.

01:23.716 --> 01:25.585
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE

01:25.652 --> 01:27.654
BLOWJOB OF YOUR LIFE THEN I WANT

01:27.720 --> 01:30.323
YOU INSIDE OF ME.

01:30.390 --> 01:31.524
>> John: LOOK.

01:31.591 --> 01:32.358
I KNOW YOU MAY HAVE BEEN

01:32.425 --> 01:33.460
WONDERING, "WHAT'RE THEY GOING

01:33.526 --> 01:34.093
TO TALK ABOUT WHEN THEY COME

01:34.160 --> 01:36.763
BACK?

01:36.830 --> 01:37.363
WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT IT HAS TO

01:37.430 --> 01:37.964
BE THE FIRST THING THEY BRING

01:38.031 --> 01:39.098
UP?"

01:39.165 --> 01:42.202
WELL, IT'S THIS.

01:42.268 --> 01:42.769
SINCE THE MOMENT THE PHRASE

01:42.836 --> 01:43.403
"STRAP-ON HARNESS" CAREENED OUT

01:43.470 --> 01:44.737
OF SENATOR FOGHORN LEGHORN'S

01:44.804 --> 01:46.773
MOUTH, IT WAS ALWAYS THIS.

01:46.840 --> 01:47.807
AND SURE, HE STUMBLES ON

01:47.874 --> 01:48.708
"STRAP-ON," BUT HE GLIDES

01:48.775 --> 01:52.645
BEAUTIFULLY THROUGH

01:52.712 --> 01:53.847
DOESN'T FALTER FOR A SECOND ON

01:53.913 --> 01:55.014
"COCK IN MY MOUTH,"

01:55.081 --> 01:55.648
THEN STICKS THE LANDING ON

01:55.715 --> 01:56.716
"BLOWJOB OF YOUR LIFE" WHILE

01:56.783 --> 01:57.317
PUNCTUATING IT WITH A PERFECT

01:57.383 --> 02:00.220
LOOK DOWN HIS GLASSES.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.422
IT'S A TRULY SUBLIME 25 SECONDS,

02:02.489 --> 02:03.056
AND IF WE DIDN'T HAVE SO MUCH TO

02:03.122 --> 02:04.023
CATCH UP ON TONIGHT, I WOULD

02:04.090 --> 02:05.058
PLAY IT ON REPEAT FOR THE REST

02:05.124 --> 02:07.060
OF THE SHOW.

02:07.126 --> 02:08.595
BUT CLEARLY, A LOT MORE HAPPENED

02:08.661 --> 02:09.896
IN THE WORLD OF POLITICS.

02:09.963 --> 02:10.964
THE SUPREME COURT EFFECTIVELY

02:11.030 --> 02:12.599
BANNED AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.

02:12.665 --> 02:13.633
TRUMP WAS INDICTED MULTIPLE

02:13.700 --> 02:14.834
TIMES, ONE OF WHICH GAVE US THIS

02:14.901 --> 02:16.336
MUG SHOT IN WHICH HE LOOKS LIKE

02:16.402 --> 02:17.604
HE'S STRUGGLING TO FIND WALDO ON

02:17.670 --> 02:20.473
A CROWDED SKI SLOPE.

02:20.540 --> 02:21.875
AND LAUREN BOEBERT WAS KICKED

02:21.941 --> 02:23.042
OUT OF A MUSICAL FOR

02:23.109 --> 02:24.244
INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.478
AND WHILE I WOULD LOVE TO JOKE

02:25.545 --> 02:26.513
ABOUT THAT, I DON'T WANT TO GET

02:26.579 --> 02:27.680
BOGGED DOWN IN IT.

02:27.747 --> 02:28.414
AFTER ALL, SHE WAS KICKED OUT OF

02:28.481 --> 02:29.382
THE SHOW.

02:29.449 --> 02:30.450
THAT IS PROBABLY PUNISHMENT

02:30.517 --> 02:30.884
ENOUGH.

02:30.950 --> 02:32.185
SO INSTEAD WE'RE GOING TO MOVE

02:32.252 --> 02:33.419
ON TO ITALY, WHERE ECONOMIC

02:33.486 --> 02:35.288
PROBLEMS HAVE PUT REAL PRESSURE

02:35.355 --> 02:36.856
ON PRIME MINISTER GEORGIA

02:36.923 --> 02:38.391
MELONI'S UPCOMING BUDGET --

02:38.458 --> 02:39.759
ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.060
JUST BRIEFLY, THE INAPPROPRIATE

02:41.127 --> 02:43.663
BEHAVIOR THAT BOEBERT ENGAGED IN

02:43.730 --> 02:45.365
APPARENTLY INVOLVED HER BEING

02:45.431 --> 02:46.165
LOUD AND REFUSING TO STOP VAPING

02:46.232 --> 02:49.702
AROUND A PREGNANT WOMAN.

02:49.769 --> 02:51.037
ALSO THERE WAS SOME FONDLING AND

02:51.104 --> 02:54.207
LIGHT OVER-THE-PANTS HAND STUFF

02:54.274 --> 02:55.141
WHICH WAS CAUGHT ON VIDEO.

02:55.208 --> 02:57.010
BUT AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO GET

02:57.076 --> 02:57.744
INTO THAT TOO MUCH, BECAUSE IN

02:57.810 --> 02:58.912
ITALY, MARKETS ARE DUBIOUS THAT

02:58.978 --> 02:59.679
MELONI WILL BE ABLE TO --

02:59.746 --> 03:03.316
IT WAS "BEETLEJUICE," BY THE

03:03.383 --> 03:04.183
WAY.

03:04.250 --> 03:07.854
THAT WAS THE MUSICAL

03:07.921 --> 03:09.222
LAUREN BOEBERT WAS WATCHING.

03:09.289 --> 03:09.822
IT WAS A TOURING PRODUCTION OF

03:09.889 --> 03:12.225
"BEETLEJUICE THE MUSICAL."

03:12.292 --> 03:13.126
I JUST NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT.

03:13.192 --> 03:13.760
I'M NOT SAYING IT'D BE

03:13.826 --> 03:14.561
APPROPRIATE TO ENGAGE IN HIGH

03:14.627 --> 03:15.161
SCHOOL FRESHMAN-ERA HAND STUFF

03:15.228 --> 03:16.229
DURING A PRODUCTION OF ANY

03:16.296 --> 03:16.896
MUSICAL, BUT I JUST WANTED TO BE

03:16.963 --> 03:18.364
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THIS

03:18.431 --> 03:19.666
WASN'T ONE OF THE MORE

03:19.732 --> 03:23.937
EXPLICITLY SEXUAL ONES

03:24.003 --> 03:24.737
LIKE "SPRING AWAKENING" OR

03:24.804 --> 03:27.040
"ROCKY HORROR" OR "CATS

03:27.106 --> 03:29.576
THIS WAS "BEETLEJUICE," A SHOW

03:29.642 --> 03:30.777
THAT'S QUITE LOUDLY ABOUT DEATH.

03:30.843 --> 03:31.444
I'M JUST SAYING, IF YOU'RE GOING

03:31.511 --> 03:32.378
TO GET YOUR NIPPLES TWEAKED AND

03:32.445 --> 03:33.780
YOUR PIPE SQUEAKED, YOU SAVE

03:33.846 --> 03:35.048
THAT SHIT FOR "FIDDLER" LIKE A

03:35.114 --> 03:36.849
GODDAMN ADULT.

03:36.916 --> 03:38.885
BUT AGAIN, IT'S AN OLD STORY,

03:38.952 --> 03:42.121
IT'S BEEN RESOLVED, AND IT

03:42.188 --> 03:43.523
FUNDAMENTALLY DOESN'T MATTER.

03:43.590 --> 03:44.857
WHAT MATTERS IS, IN ITALY,

03:44.924 --> 03:46.359
ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES ARE

03:46.426 --> 03:46.926
CAUSING SOME SIGNIFICANT --

03:46.993 --> 03:49.862
SORRY, THERE IS JUST ONE MORE

03:49.929 --> 03:50.730
THING ABOUT LAUREN BOEBERT.

03:50.797 --> 03:51.965
REPORTS SAY THAT AFTER RECEIVING

03:52.031 --> 03:53.733
A WARNING AT INTERMISSION, THE

03:53.800 --> 03:54.367
FINAL COMPLAINT THAT LED TO HER

03:54.434 --> 03:54.834
BEING KICKED OUT CAME

03:54.901 --> 03:56.135
FIVE MINUTES INTO ACT II.

03:56.202 --> 03:57.503
NOW, IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE SHOW,

03:57.570 --> 03:58.905
THAT PUTS US COMFORTABLY INTO

03:58.972 --> 04:00.373
"THAT BEAUTIFUL SOUND," A SONG

04:00.440 --> 04:01.908
WHERE BEETLEJUICE AND LIDIA

04:01.975 --> 04:03.009
GLEEFULLY TORTURE A SERIES OF

04:03.076 --> 04:04.944
VISITORS INCLUDING A GIRL SCOUT,

04:05.011 --> 04:06.212
A PIZZA DELIVERY PERSON, AND ONE

04:06.279 --> 04:09.716
OF THEIR NEIGHBORS.

04:09.782 --> 04:10.516
IT'S A SONG ABOUT HOW THEY LIKE

04:10.583 --> 04:12.118
THE SOUND OF TORTURED SCREAMS.

04:12.185 --> 04:12.986
IS IT THE LEAST SEXY THING

04:13.052 --> 04:14.454
PERSON CAN SIT THROUGH?

04:14.520 --> 04:14.621
NO.

04:14.687 --> 04:16.489
THAT WOULD BE THIS

04:16.556 --> 04:19.292
BUT IT IS UP THERE.

04:19.359 --> 04:20.126
ANYWAY, AS SHE WAS BEING

04:20.193 --> 04:20.793
ESCORTED OUT OF THE THEATER, SHE

04:20.860 --> 04:24.797
APPARENT SAID "DO YOU KNOW WHO

04:24.864 --> 04:25.965
I AM?" AND "I WILL BE CONTACTING

04:26.032 --> 04:26.532
THE MAYOR."

04:26.599 --> 04:27.166
WHICH ARE TWO JUST

04:27.233 --> 04:28.501
CATASTROPHICALLY BAD DECISIONS.

04:28.568 --> 04:29.902
IF YOU'VE BEEN CAUGHT FOR,

04:29.969 --> 04:31.971
AGAIN, SEXUAL ACTIVITY DURING

04:32.038 --> 04:37.076
"BEETLEJUICE THE MUSICAL," YOU'D

04:37.143 --> 04:38.378
HOPE NO ONE KNEW WHO YOU WERE

04:38.444 --> 04:39.012
AND YOU DEFINITELY WOULDN'T WANT

04:39.078 --> 04:40.013
TO IMMEDIATELY GET ON THE PHONE

04:40.079 --> 04:40.647
WITH THE MAYOR TO TELL HIM WHAT

04:40.713 --> 04:43.616
HAD JUST HAPPENED.

04:43.683 --> 04:48.021
AND THE THING IS, SADLY, THIS

04:48.087 --> 04:48.888
INCIDENT HAS NOW DERAILED ME SO

04:48.955 --> 04:49.689
MUCH, I DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO

04:49.756 --> 04:50.556
TALK ABOUT ITALY'S ECONOMIC

04:50.623 --> 04:51.157
STRUGGLES ANYMORE, SO -- MUCH

04:51.224 --> 04:52.091
LIKE LAUREN BOEBERT AND THE

04:52.158 --> 04:52.725
MUSICAL "BEETLEJUICE" -- YOU'LL

04:52.792 --> 04:53.292
NEVER GET TO KNOW HOW IT ALL

04:53.359 --> 04:56.529
TURNS OUT.

04:56.596 --> 04:57.630
INSTEAD, WE NEED TO CATCH UP ON

04:57.697 --> 04:58.197
WHAT HAPPENED IN NEWERSEY,

04:58.264 --> 04:58.931
WHOSE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR

04:58.998 --> 05:00.400
BOB MENENDEZ WAS INDICTED ON

05:00.466 --> 05:01.434
CORRUPTION CHARGES FOR ACCEPTING

05:01.501 --> 05:02.702
BRIBES TO AID LOCAL BUSINESSMEN

05:02.769 --> 05:03.436
AND BENEFIT THE EGYPTIAN

05:03.503 --> 05:04.437
GOVERNMENT.

05:04.504 --> 05:06.539
AND WHILE HE HAS DENIED THOSE

05:06.606 --> 05:08.474
CHARGES, SOME OF THE DETAILS

05:08.541 --> 05:09.642
LOOK PRETTY BAD.

05:09.709 --> 05:10.843
>> THE INDICTMENT ALLEGES

05:10.910 --> 05:13.046
MENENDEZ AND HIS WIFE RECEIVED

05:13.112 --> 05:13.846
NEARLY A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN

05:13.913 --> 05:15.348
CASH AND $150,000 WORTH OF GOLD

05:15.415 --> 05:17.684
BARS.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.018
PROSECUTORS ALSO SAY THAT THE

05:19.085 --> 05:20.219
DAY AFTER THE TWO RETURNED FROM

05:20.286 --> 05:21.854
A TRIP TO EGYPT, MENENDEZ

05:21.921 --> 05:25.291
SEARCHED ONLINE, "HOW MUCH IS

05:25.358 --> 05:27.794
ONE KILO OF GOLD WORTH?"

05:27.860 --> 05:30.430
>> John: YEAH, NOT GREAT, BOB!

05:30.496 --> 05:32.432
THAT IS PRETTY INCRIMINATING.

05:32.498 --> 05:33.566
NO ONE CASUALLY GOOGLES "HOW

05:33.633 --> 05:35.101
MUCH IS ONE KILO OF GOLD WORTH?"

05:35.168 --> 05:37.437
BECAUSE THEY'RE BORED.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.905
THEY GOOGLE, "DO BUTTERFLIES

05:38.971 --> 05:40.373
FEEL PAIN WHEN THEY FWAP THEIR

05:40.440 --> 05:41.474
WINGS?"

05:41.541 --> 05:42.809
"JUST HOW LITTLE LOVE CAN A

05:42.875 --> 05:43.876
PERSON LIVE ON?"

05:43.943 --> 05:44.844
AND "WHAT EXACTLY IS A

05:44.911 --> 05:47.213
TRAVIS KELCE?"

05:47.280 --> 05:48.715
"HOW MUCH IS ONE KILO OF GOLD

05:48.781 --> 05:49.449
WORTH?" IS AN INHERENTLY

05:49.515 --> 05:50.917
INCRIMINATING GOOGLE SEARCH,

05:50.983 --> 05:55.421
IT'S RIGHT UP THERE WITH "CAN

05:55.488 --> 05:56.189
YOU SNORT ADDERALL" OR "HOW TO

05:56.255 --> 05:56.989
GET BLOODSTAINS OUT OF YOUR

05:57.056 --> 05:58.124
WIFE."

05:58.191 --> 05:58.991
AND IT'S NOT JUST MENENDEZ WHO'S

05:59.058 --> 06:01.160
BEEN IN LEGAL JEOPARDY --

06:01.227 --> 06:01.994
PILLOW BARON MIKE LINDELL

06:02.061 --> 06:02.762
CONTINUES TO FACE LAWSUITS

06:02.829 --> 06:03.696
STEMMING FROM THE FALSE CLAIMS

06:03.763 --> 06:04.897
HE PROMOTED ABOUT VOTING

06:04.964 --> 06:05.932
MACHINES, AND A FEW WEEKS AGO, A

06:05.998 --> 06:07.734
DEPOSITION FROM ONE OF THOSE

06:07.800 --> 06:09.302
CASES CAME OUT, FEATURING THIS

06:09.368 --> 06:10.803
SPECTACULAR MOMENT, AS HE

06:10.870 --> 06:11.471
DISCUSSED WHAT SORT OF

06:11.537 --> 06:13.072
CUSTOMER SERVICE CALLS HIS

06:13.139 --> 06:14.107
COMPANY GETS.

06:14.173 --> 06:15.441
>> OKAY.

06:15.508 --> 06:18.377
AND I'M NOT ASKING ABOUT THE

06:18.444 --> 06:20.713
LUMPY PILLOW CALLS.

06:20.780 --> 06:21.714
>> NO, THEY'RE NOT LUMPY

06:21.781 --> 06:22.348
PILLOWS.

06:22.415 --> 06:24.450
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY CALL ON.

06:24.517 --> 06:25.585
OKAY.

06:25.651 --> 06:26.586
WHEN YOU SAY LUMPY PILLOWS, NOW

06:26.652 --> 06:27.220
YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE, YOU GOT THAT,

06:27.286 --> 06:28.121
YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE IS WHAT YOU

06:28.187 --> 06:28.821
ARE.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.256
>> MIKE, MIKE.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.891
>> NO, HE'S AN ASSHOLE.

06:31.958 --> 06:32.825
HE'S AN AMBULANCE-CHASING

06:32.892 --> 06:33.760
ASSHOLE.

06:33.826 --> 06:34.727
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

06:34.794 --> 06:36.729
LUMPY PILLOWS?

06:36.796 --> 06:37.497
KISS MY ASS.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.699
>> John: YOU KNOW, MY FAVORITE

06:39.766 --> 06:40.833
THING ABOUT MIKE LINDELL IS THAT

06:40.900 --> 06:42.101
HE'S THE RARE EXAMPLE OF HOW

06:42.168 --> 06:42.735
RECOVERING FROM A CRACK

06:42.802 --> 06:44.170
ADDICTION CAN ACTIVELY MAKE YOU

06:44.237 --> 06:46.806
WORSE.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.641
ALTHOUGH, FOR THE RECORD, MIKE,

06:48.708 --> 06:50.276
IF THEY ARE NOT LUMPY PILLOWS,

06:50.343 --> 06:54.180
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS AMAZON

06:54.247 --> 06:54.714
LISTING FOR YOUR PRODUCT,

06:54.781 --> 06:55.314
FEATURING A VERY REAL EXCHANGE

06:55.381 --> 06:56.415
IN WHICH ONE CUSTOMER ASKS

06:56.482 --> 06:56.983
"SHOULD IT BE THIS LUMPY AND

06:57.049 --> 06:59.619
FLAT?

06:59.685 --> 07:00.720
I JUST GOT IT."

07:00.787 --> 07:03.356
AND ANOTHER REPLIES "MINE WAS/IS

07:03.422 --> 07:04.223
LUMPY."

07:04.290 --> 07:04.857
OR THIS REVIEW TITLED, "IT IS A

07:04.924 --> 07:06.225
BAG O' LUMPS."

07:06.292 --> 07:07.727
OR THIS ONE TITLED "LUMPY," WITH

07:07.794 --> 07:12.765
WE ALSO MISSED A BCH OF

07:12.832 --> 07:13.566
INTERNATIONAL NEWS, LIKE THE

07:13.633 --> 07:18.437
CORONATION OF KING CHARLES, THE

07:18.504 --> 07:19.238
WORLD'S OLDEST BOY, DURING WHICH

07:19.305 --> 07:21.140
HE SAID "I COME NOT TO BE

07:21.207 --> 07:21.607
SERVED, BUT TO SERVE."

07:21.674 --> 07:22.708
ALTHOUGH HE CLEARLY DIDN'T MEAN

07:22.775 --> 07:23.442
THAT IN THE SENSE OF

07:23.509 --> 07:24.577
"SERVING LOOKS," GIVEN THAT THIS

07:24.644 --> 07:26.579
IS HIS OFFICIAL CORONATION

07:26.646 --> 07:29.749
PORTRAIT, IN WHICH HE SEEMS TO

07:29.816 --> 07:30.883
BE AIMING FOR "SUCCESSFUL PIMP"

07:30.950 --> 07:31.684
BUT ENDS UP LOOKING LIKE SOMEONE

07:31.751 --> 07:32.652
WEARING A SET OF TACKY DRAPES

07:32.718 --> 07:35.755
OVER A LAKERS JERSEY.

07:35.822 --> 07:37.390
ALSO, TURKEY HAD AN ELECTION,

07:37.456 --> 07:39.425
WHICH ERDOGAN NARROWLY WON.

07:39.492 --> 07:40.626
AND, FOR ABOUT A DAY AND A HALF,

07:40.693 --> 07:42.428
IT SEEMED LIKE THERE GENUINELY

07:42.495 --> 07:44.063
MIGHT BE A COUP IN RUSSIA, WHICH

07:44.130 --> 07:45.198
ENDED WITH ITS LEADER,

07:45.264 --> 07:48.668
YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, ACCEPTING A

07:48.734 --> 07:49.235
WEIRD DEAL BROKERED BY THE

07:49.302 --> 07:49.869
BELARUSSIAN PRESIDENT, AND THEN

07:49.936 --> 07:50.636
DYING IN THE MOST PREDICTABLE

07:50.703 --> 07:53.873
PLANE CRASH OF ALL TIME.

07:53.940 --> 07:54.740
AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT, CHINA

07:54.807 --> 07:56.042
WAS SHAKEN TO THE CORE BY THIS

07:56.108 --> 07:57.977
CONTROVERSY:

07:58.044 --> 08:01.247
>> IT'S BIZARRE VIDEO OF A

08:01.314 --> 08:02.582
SPECIES KNOWN AS A SUN BEAR

08:02.648 --> 08:03.416
THAT'S LEADING EVERYONE TO ASK,

08:03.482 --> 08:04.650
"IS THAT REALLY A BEAR OR JUST A

08:04.717 --> 08:06.152
GUY IN A BEAR SUIT?"

08:06.219 --> 08:08.421
THE CREATURE, NAMED "ANGELA,"

08:08.487 --> 08:11.390
STANDS UPRIGHT JUST LIKE A

08:11.457 --> 08:12.592
HUMAN, AND ARE THOSE WRINKLES?

08:12.658 --> 08:13.926
IT SURE GIVES THE IMPRESSION

08:13.993 --> 08:16.329
THAT IT'S A DUDE IN AN

08:16.395 --> 08:18.197
ILL-FITTING BEAR COSTUME.

08:18.264 --> 08:19.498
AND JUST LOOK AT THE WAY SHE

08:19.565 --> 08:20.867
WAVES.

08:20.933 --> 08:23.603
NOW CHINESE ZOO AUTHORITIES ARE

08:23.669 --> 08:24.570
SETTLING THE MYSTERY, DECLARING,

08:24.637 --> 08:26.172
"ANGELA IS DEFINITELY NOT A

08:26.239 --> 08:27.173
HUMAN."

08:27.240 --> 08:28.541
>> John: HEY!

08:28.608 --> 08:29.809
HEY!

08:29.876 --> 08:31.277
EVERYONE!

08:31.344 --> 08:35.381
LEAVE ANGELA ALONE!

08:35.448 --> 08:35.982
STOP TALKING ABOUT HER AWKWARD

08:36.048 --> 08:36.883
WAVE AND WRINKLY BOTTOM.

08:36.949 --> 08:40.920
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY I'M SO

08:40.987 --> 08:42.154
PERSONALLY INVESTED IN THIS --

08:42.221 --> 08:43.723
SOME OF US NEVER GET TO SEE OUR

08:43.789 --> 08:45.057
EXACT BODY TYPE ON SCREEN, AND

08:45.124 --> 08:47.460
FINALLY I GET WHY REPRESENTATION

08:47.526 --> 08:48.694
MATTERS.

08:48.761 --> 08:50.329
AND SPEAKING OF REPRESENTATIONS

08:50.396 --> 08:51.264
OF ME SPECIFICALLY, BACK IN

08:51.330 --> 08:53.032
JUNE, AFTER REDDIT ANNOUNCED A

08:53.099 --> 08:54.600
NEW POLICY TO CHARGE THIRD-PARTY

08:54.667 --> 08:56.969
APPS FOR ACCESSING ITS DATA,

08:57.036 --> 08:58.571
MANY OF ITS MEMBERS ENGAGED IN A

08:58.638 --> 09:00.339
STRIKING PROTEST.

09:00.406 --> 09:01.474
>> SOME OF THE BIGGEST FORUMS ON

09:01.540 --> 09:03.442
REDDIT ARE BEING FLOODED WITH

09:03.509 --> 09:04.410
PHOTOS OF COMEDIAN JOHN OLIVER.

09:04.477 --> 09:07.713
THIS IS ALL TAKING PLACE OVER A

09:07.780 --> 09:08.648
PROTEST TO CHANGES ON HOW THE

09:08.714 --> 09:11.250
WEBSITE IS BEING RUN.

09:11.317 --> 09:12.051
TWO OF THE MOST POPULAR

09:12.118 --> 09:13.686
SO-CALLED SUBREDDITS HAVE

09:13.753 --> 09:14.820
DECIDED TO POST NOTHING BUT

09:14.887 --> 09:16.255
PHOTOS OF OLIVER.

09:16.322 --> 09:18.691
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

09:18.758 --> 09:19.525
FOR WEEKS, IMAGES OF ME WERE

09:19.592 --> 09:22.228
USED AS A FORM OF PROTEST ON

09:22.295 --> 09:22.929
SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR

09:22.995 --> 09:23.829
SUBREDDITS.

09:23.896 --> 09:24.430
AND TO THEIR CREDIT, THEY USED

09:24.497 --> 09:25.431
SOME PRETTY GOOD ONES, LIKE THIS

09:25.498 --> 09:27.400
ONE OF ME AS A MUPPET,

09:27.466 --> 09:28.567
THIS ONE OF ME AS A BLOBFISH,

09:28.634 --> 09:30.102
THIS ONE OF ME APPEARING IN A

09:30.169 --> 09:31.837
PIECE OF TOAST,

09:31.904 --> 09:33.005
AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE,

09:33.072 --> 09:33.973
THIS ONE LABELED

09:34.040 --> 09:38.010
"JOHN OLIVER WICK,"

09:38.077 --> 09:40.212
WHICH IS A PRETTY GOOD WAY OF

09:40.279 --> 09:41.347
SHOWING YOU EXACTLY WHAT

09:41.414 --> 09:41.814
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF

09:41.881 --> 09:42.481
PROFESSOR SNAPE EVER COMMITTED

09:42.548 --> 09:43.349
ARMED ROBBERY.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.383
IT WAS A PRETTY INSPIRING ACT OF

09:44.450 --> 09:46.852
MALICIOUS COMPLIANCE, BUT JUST

09:46.919 --> 09:50.756
WATCH AS TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT

09:50.823 --> 09:51.590
SEEMED TO BREAK THE BRAINS OF

09:51.657 --> 09:52.625
THAT LOCAL NEWS TEAM.

09:52.692 --> 09:54.226
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS --

09:54.293 --> 09:54.827
SO ARE THEY FOR JOHN OLIVER?

09:54.894 --> 09:55.761
>> I ACTUALLY --

09:55.828 --> 09:56.162
>> OR AGAINST HIM?

09:56.228 --> 09:56.963
>> I -- I THINK THIS IS JUST

09:57.029 --> 09:58.164
PART OF THEIR-THEIR PROTEST.

09:58.230 --> 09:59.865
>> SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT UP

09:59.932 --> 10:01.300
SOMETHING THAT'S BORING, THAT

10:01.367 --> 10:03.302
NOBODY'S GOING TO CARE ABOUT.

10:03.369 --> 10:04.503
>> SILLY.

10:04.570 --> 10:05.371
>> IS THAT RIGHT?

10:05.438 --> 10:06.539
>> WELL, THIS SAYS -- MODERATORS

10:06.605 --> 10:07.306
OF A CERTAIN SUBREDDIT SAY THAT

10:07.373 --> 10:08.441
THEY'RE ONLY ALLOWING USERS TO

10:08.507 --> 10:09.308
POST PICTURES OF JOHN OLIVER

10:09.375 --> 10:10.609
"LOOKING SEXY."

10:10.676 --> 10:11.210
AND IN FACT --

10:11.277 --> 10:12.378
[LAUGHS]

10:12.445 --> 10:13.012
ANY PICTURE OF THE COMEDIAN WAS

10:13.079 --> 10:13.779
ALLOWED BECAUSE JOHN OLIVER IS

10:13.846 --> 10:14.380
ALWAYS SEXY.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.014
SO YOU'RE SAYING BORING --

10:15.081 --> 10:16.082
ACCORDING TO THE REDDIT USERS,

10:16.148 --> 10:16.582
THEY'RE DOING IT 'CAUSE

10:16.649 --> 10:18.117
HE'S SEXY.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.085
I DON'T KNOW!

10:19.151 --> 10:20.219
THIS IS ACCORDING TO THIS

10:20.286 --> 10:22.221
ARTICLE.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.189
>> John: OKAY, PUTTING MY

10:23.255 --> 10:24.757
FEELINGS ASIDE -- WHICH THEY

10:24.824 --> 10:30.496
CERTAINLY DID THERE -- WHY DOES

10:30.563 --> 10:31.797
IT SEEM LIKE EVERYONE ON THAT

10:31.864 --> 10:32.398
SHOW IS COMPLETELY UNPREPARED?

10:32.465 --> 10:32.965
THIS GUY IS CONFUSED BY THE

10:33.032 --> 10:33.499
STORY ENTIRELY, AND SHE'S

10:33.566 --> 10:36.202
GOOGLING IT LIVE ON AIR.

10:36.268 --> 10:37.136
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE HOSTING AN

10:37.203 --> 10:38.471
IMPROV SHOW WHERE THE AUDIENCE

10:38.537 --> 10:39.238
GAVE THEM THE WORDS "REDDIT,"

10:39.305 --> 10:41.207
"SEXY," AND "JOHN OLIVER," AND

10:41.273 --> 10:42.742
THEY HAD TO BUILD A SCENE AROUND

10:42.808 --> 10:43.142
THAT.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.377
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER MAJOR

10:44.443 --> 10:45.378
POP CULTURE NEWS WE MISSED?

10:45.444 --> 10:48.881
BARBENHEIMER!

10:48.948 --> 10:50.383
IT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST MOVIE

10:50.449 --> 10:51.017
EVENTS OF THE SUMMER, ALONGSIDE

10:51.083 --> 10:52.451
"SOUND OF FREEDOM," THE

10:52.518 --> 10:53.252
FEEL-GOOD CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING

10:53.319 --> 10:56.489
HIT WE'D ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.

10:56.555 --> 10:57.690
ALTHOUGH I'D ARGUE, IF YOU'RE

10:57.757 --> 10:58.824
LOOKING FOR THE SINGLE-BEST

10:58.891 --> 11:00.960
MOVIE OF THE SUMMER, IT'S GOTTA

11:01.027 --> 11:02.795
BE "COP SLIDE":

11:02.862 --> 11:05.998
>> IT ALMOST HURTS TO WATCH.

11:06.065 --> 11:08.000
A POLICE OFFICER IS TAKING A

11:08.067 --> 11:10.036
QUICK BREAK, HEADING DOWN A

11:10.102 --> 11:11.270
POPULAR SLIDE.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.639
OUCH!

11:13.706 --> 11:14.340
IT'S LIKE HE'S SHOT OUT OF A

11:14.407 --> 11:17.410
CANNON.

11:17.476 --> 11:18.377
HE HITS THE GROUND HARD.

11:18.444 --> 11:19.545
>> John: YEAH.

11:19.612 --> 11:20.112
YEAH, HE DOES HIT THE GROUND

11:20.179 --> 11:23.215
HARD.

11:23.282 --> 11:24.216
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

11:24.283 --> 11:32.558
FROM THE SOUND OF HIM THUNDERING

11:32.625 --> 11:34.527
DOWN THE SLIDE, TO HIS COP TOYS

11:34.593 --> 11:35.261
FLYING.

11:35.327 --> 11:35.795
IT'S CINEMA AT ITS FINEST.

11:35.861 --> 11:36.429
IT'S NOT THE FIRST, AND IT WON'T

11:36.495 --> 11:36.996
BE THE LAST TIME THAT I SAY

11:37.063 --> 11:37.630
THIS, BUT "I WISH COPS TURNED ON

11:37.696 --> 11:38.097
THEIR BODY CAMS MORE."

11:38.164 --> 11:38.898
BECAUSE I'D LOVE TO HAVE SEEN

11:38.964 --> 11:39.498
THAT FROM INSIDE THE SLIDE AS

11:39.565 --> 11:39.899
WELL.

11:39.965 --> 11:40.733
"COP SLIDE" TOOK THE INTERNET BY

11:40.800 --> 11:42.068
STORM, INSPIRING MEMES AND

11:42.134 --> 11:44.370
REMIXES, MY FAVORITE OF WHICH

11:44.437 --> 11:45.604
WAS THIS:

11:45.671 --> 11:47.039
>> ♪ PAIN STILL GROWS ♪

11:47.106 --> 11:48.974
♪ IT'S NO STRANGER TO YOU AND

12:03.622 --> 12:05.257

12:05.324 --> 12:05.758
EAT YOUR HEART OUT,

12:05.825 --> 12:06.559
"MIAMI VICE."

12:06.625 --> 12:07.059
THAT IS NOW THE ALL-TIME

12:07.126 --> 12:07.593
GREATEST USE OF THAT SONG.

12:07.660 --> 12:08.661
THE VIDEO WENT SO VIRAL,

12:08.727 --> 12:10.329
"BOSTON COP SLIDE" IS NOW LISTED

12:10.396 --> 12:12.064
ON GOOGLE MAPS.

12:12.131 --> 12:13.699
AND BECAUSE IT'S IN BOSTON, IT'S

12:13.766 --> 12:16.902
OF COURSE DOWN THE STREET FROM A

12:16.969 --> 12:17.770
DUNKIN', AND ACROSS THE PLAZA

12:17.837 --> 12:18.604
FROM ANOTHER DUNKIN', WHICH IS

12:18.671 --> 12:20.406
NEXT TO ANOTHER DUNKIN', WHICH

12:20.473 --> 12:21.640
IS ACROSS THE STREET FROM

12:21.707 --> 12:24.510
ANOTHER FUCKING DUNKIN'.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.545
THERE ARE FOUR DUNKIN'S WITHIN A

12:26.612 --> 12:27.480
ONE-BLOCK RADIUS OF COP SLIDE.

12:27.546 --> 12:28.414
AND IF YOU EXPAND IT A FEW

12:28.481 --> 12:28.914
BLOCKS, THERE ARE 13 OF

12:28.981 --> 12:31.917
THEM.

12:31.984 --> 12:32.651
BOSTON, YOU TRULY ARE A

12:32.718 --> 12:33.519
SELF-PARODY.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.488
THE POINT IS, WE MISSED SO MANY

12:35.554 --> 12:36.822
STORIES.

12:36.889 --> 12:38.057
I HAVEN'T EVEN BROUGHT UP THE

12:38.124 --> 12:41.060
TITAN SUBMERSIB!

12:41.127 --> 12:41.760
YEAH, WE MISSED THAT TOO!

12:41.827 --> 12:42.895
THAT WAS A WEIRD FEW DAYS,

12:42.962 --> 12:44.330
WASN'T IT?

12:44.396 --> 12:45.931
ALSO, THERE WAS A BATSHIT RAID

12:45.998 --> 12:47.233
ON A NEWSPAPER IN KANSAS,

12:47.299 --> 12:48.767
WILDFIRES IN MAUI, AND A

12:48.834 --> 12:49.902
SPECTACULAR BRAWL AT A DOCK IN

12:49.969 --> 12:51.003
MONTGOMERY WHERE SOME DRUNKEN

12:51.070 --> 12:52.138
WHITE ASSHOLES GOT THEIR ASSES

12:52.204 --> 12:53.305
AND A FOLDING CHAIR HANDED TO

12:53.372 --> 12:58.110
THEM.

12:58.177 --> 12:59.211
WE MISSED SO MUCH IT WOULD TAKE

12:59.278 --> 13:00.346
A WHOLE NEW VERSION OF

13:00.412 --> 13:00.946
BILLY JOEL'S "WE DIDN'T START

13:01.013 --> 13:01.814
THE FIRE" TO COVER IT.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.116
WHICH REMINDS OF SOMETHING ELSE

13:04.183 --> 13:05.284
WE MISSED: FALLOUT BOY RELEASED

13:05.351 --> 13:06.418
A NEW VERSION OF "WE DIDN'T

13:06.485 --> 13:08.754
START THE FIRE" THAT ABSOLUTELY

13:08.821 --> 13:09.822
NOBODY ASKED FOR, COVERING THE

13:09.889 --> 13:12.158
LAST 34 YEARS.

13:12.224 --> 13:14.093
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING, "HOLD

13:14.160 --> 13:14.660
ON, HOLD ON, 2001 WAS IN THE

13:14.727 --> 13:16.028
LAST 34 YEARS.

13:16.095 --> 13:17.163
THEY DIDN'T BRING UP THAT THING,

13:17.229 --> 13:18.497
DID THEY?"

13:18.564 --> 13:19.165
WELL, THE ANSWER IS, YES, THEY

COVERED ALL OF THESE STORIES

14:33.539 --> 14:34.006
BACK WHEN THEY ORIGINALLY

14:34.073 --> 14:34.473
HAPPENED.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.107
I WISH SO MUCH I COULD HAVE TOLD

14:35.174 --> 14:35.774
YOU THESE JOKES AT THE TIME.

14:35.841 --> 14:36.709
BUT I COULDN'T, BECAUSE OUR

14:36.775 --> 14:37.409
WRITERS -- THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE

14:37.476 --> 14:40.379
THOSE JOKES -- WERE FORCED TO

14:40.446 --> 14:40.980
STRIKE FOR A FAIR CONTRACT FOR

14:41.046 --> 14:42.848
THE LAST FIVE NTHS.

14:42.915 --> 14:43.983
AND IT WAS AN IMMENSELY

14:44.049 --> 14:49.054
DIFFICULT TIME, NOT JUST FOR

14:49.121 --> 14:50.589
THEM, BUT FOR EVERYONE ELSE

14:50.656 --> 14:51.624
WORKING ON THIS SHOW AND MANY

14:51.690 --> 14:52.658
OTHERS WHO COULD NO LONGER DO

14:52.725 --> 14:53.225
THEIR JOBS.

14:53.292 --> 14:53.792
AND TO BE CLEAR, THIS STRIKE

14:53.859 --> 14:54.860
HAPPENED FOR GOOD REASONS.

14:54.927 --> 14:55.728
OUR INDUSTRY HAS SEEN ITS

14:55.794 --> 14:56.929
WORKERS SEVERELY SQUEEZED IN

14:56.996 --> 14:58.764
RECENT YEARS.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.933
YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN STORIES

15:01.000 --> 15:04.970
ABOUT WRITERS AND ACTORS,

15:05.037 --> 15:06.438
WHOSE WORK YOU MAY EVEN

15:06.505 --> 15:09.375
RECOGNIZE, ROUTINELY NOT MAKING

15:09.441 --> 15:11.310
ENOUGH TO QUALIFY FOR

15:11.377 --> 15:12.011
HEALTH INSURANCE

15:12.077 --> 15:12.478
OR AFFORD BASIC NEEDS.

15:12.544 --> 15:13.345
SO THE WRITERS' GUILD WENT ON

15:13.412 --> 15:14.513
STRIKE, AND THANKFULLY WON, BUT

15:14.580 --> 15:15.147
IT TOOK A LOT OF SACRIFICES FROM

15:15.214 --> 15:15.781
A LOT OF PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE THAT.

15:15.848 --> 15:16.382
AND WHILE I'M HAPPY THAT THEY

15:16.448 --> 15:17.216
EVENTUALLY GOT A FAIR DEAL, AND

15:17.283 --> 15:17.783
IMMENSELY PROUD OF WHAT OUR

15:17.850 --> 15:19.752
UNION ACCOMPLISHED, I'M ALSO

15:19.818 --> 15:20.519
FURIOUS THAT IT TOOK THE STUDIOS

15:20.586 --> 15:24.757
148 DAYS TO ACHIEVE A DEAL THEY

15:24.823 --> 15:27.860
COULD'VE OFFERED ON DAY FUCKING

15:27.926 --> 15:28.994
ONE.

15:29.061 --> 15:29.995
BUT HOPEFULLY, THIS MAY

15:30.062 --> 15:32.164
ENCOURAGE OTHERS -- FROM

15:32.231 --> 15:33.098
AUTOWORKERS TO STARBUCKS

15:33.165 --> 15:34.166
BARISTAS TO HEALTH CARE

15:34.233 --> 15:34.967
PROVIDERS -- WHETHER THEY'RE IN

15:35.034 --> 15:36.702
UNIONS OR WOULD LIKE TO BE --

15:36.769 --> 15:38.771
TO FIND POWER IN EACH OTHER.

15:38.837 --> 15:40.272
AND WITHIN OUR PARTICULAR

15:40.339 --> 15:41.840
INDUSTRY, I REALLY HOPE THE

15:41.907 --> 15:43.075
ACTORS' UNION AND IATSE, WHICH

15:43.142 --> 15:44.476
REPRESENTS CREWS, WILL BE ABLE

15:44.543 --> 15:45.811
TAKE WHAT THE WRITERS ACHIEVED

15:45.878 --> 15:46.812
AND LEVERAGE IT TO WIN FAIR

15:46.879 --> 15:48.981
CONTRACTS FOR THEMSELVES TOO.

15:49.048 --> 15:50.749
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, IT TAKES

15:50.816 --> 15:52.484
MANY PEOPLE, WORKING REALLY

15:52.551 --> 15:54.386
HARD, TO MAKE FILM AND TV,

15:54.453 --> 15:56.622
ALL OF WHOM DESERVE A PIECE OF

15:56.689 --> 15:57.523
THE PIE.

15:57.589 --> 15:58.791
AND FOR THE ACTORS IN

15:58.857 --> 16:03.362
PARTICULAR, THEY CANNOT COME

16:03.429 --> 16:04.430
BACK TO WORK SOON ENOUGH.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.223
YET DESPITE ALL OF THAT, THE

19:51.290 --> 19:52.124
QUALITY OF CARE PRISONERS

19:52.190 --> 19:54.493
RECEIVE IS ABYSMAL.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.460
INVESTIGATIONS IN STATE AFTER

19:55.527 --> 19:57.029
STATE HAVE FOUND IT TO BE

19:57.095 --> 19:59.565
WOEFULLY DEFICIENT.

19:59.631 --> 20:00.566
AND A LAWSUIT AGAINST ARIZONA A

20:00.632 --> 20:01.433
WHE BACK MADE SOME HORRIFYING

20:01.500 --> 20:02.935
ALLEGATIONS.

20:03.001 --> 20:05.070
>> IT ALLEGES THAT PRISONERS ARE

20:05.137 --> 20:06.905
AT "SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF

20:06.972 --> 20:10.309
PAIN, AMPUTATION, DISFIGUREMENT,

20:10.375 --> 20:12.844
AND DEATH."

20:12.911 --> 20:13.946
IT CITES EXAMPLES OF PRISONERS

20:14.012 --> 20:15.347
BEING TOLD TO PRAY TO BE CURED

20:15.414 --> 20:17.215
OR DRINK ENERGY SHAKES

20:17.282 --> 20:18.817
TO TREAT CANCER SYMPTOMS.

20:18.884 --> 20:19.751
>> John: OKAY, THAT IS BOTH

20:19.818 --> 20:21.019
TERRIBLE ADVICE AND ALSO NOT

20:21.086 --> 20:22.721
EVEN CLOSE TO BEING TRUE.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.723
IF ENERGY DRINKS COULD TREAT

20:24.790 --> 20:25.991
CANCER SYMPTOMS, YOU WOULD HAVE

20:26.058 --> 20:27.392
HEARD ABOUT IT.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.027
RED BULL WOULD MENTION IT IN ALL

20:29.094 --> 20:30.028
OF THEIR ADS INSTEAD OF THEIR

20:30.095 --> 20:31.496
CURRENT MARKETING COPY, WHICH

20:31.563 --> 20:32.798
IS, "RED BULL, THERE'S NOTHING

20:32.864 --> 20:33.899
WE CAN DO ABOUT THE TASTE, BUT

20:33.966 --> 20:36.768
LET'S BE HONEST: YOU'RE 22 AND

20:36.835 --> 20:37.402
HUNGOVER AND JUST NEED SOMETHING

20:37.469 --> 20:38.036
TO GET YOU THROUGH YOUR SHIFT AT

20:38.103 --> 20:38.870
RED LOBSTER AND YOU'RE STILL A

20:38.937 --> 20:40.272
FEW YEARS AWAY FROM HAVING

20:40.339 --> 20:41.940
COCAINE MONEY, SO JUST SHUT UP

20:42.007 --> 20:45.944
AND PUT THIS POISON IN YOU."

20:46.011 --> 20:46.979
AND THE THING IS, THE

20:47.045 --> 20:49.514
CONSEQUENCES OF POOR CARE ARE

20:49.581 --> 20:50.382
ONLY GOING TO GET MORE DIRE,

20:50.449 --> 20:51.183
GIVEN OUR RAPIDLY AGING PRISON

20:51.249 --> 20:53.051
POPULATION.

20:53.118 --> 20:54.553
FROM 1999 TO 2015, THE NUMBER OF

20:54.620 --> 20:56.521
PEOPLE 55 OR OLDER IN PRISON

20:56.588 --> 21:00.559
INCREASED BY 264%.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.094
AND WHY ARE WE CONFINING SO MANY

21:02.160 --> 21:03.629
ELDERLY PEOPLE IN PRISONS WHEN

21:03.695 --> 21:04.896
WE SHOULD CLEARLY BE PUTTING

21:04.963 --> 21:06.164
THEM WHERE THEY BELONG:

21:06.231 --> 21:07.065
ON "THE GOLDEN BACHELOR,"

21:07.132 --> 21:11.436
TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF

21:11.503 --> 21:18.076
MENOPAUSE AND FUCKING RAW.

21:18.143 --> 21:20.245
I PRESUME THAT'S WHAT'S

21:20.312 --> 21:21.947
SO GIVEN ALL THIS, TONIGHT,

21:22.014 --> 21:22.514
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT PRISON

21:22.581 --> 21:23.115
HEALTHRE -- WHO PROVIDES IT,

21:23.181 --> 21:23.749
WHY IT'S SO BAD, AND HOW WE CAN

21:23.815 --> 21:24.282
IMPROVE IT GOING FORWARD.

21:24.349 --> 21:24.883
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

21:24.950 --> 21:25.417
THAT, AT ONE POINT, STATES

21:25.484 --> 21:26.451
THEMSELVES PROVIDED MEDICAL CARE

21:26.518 --> 21:28.553
FOR THEIR JAILS AND PRISONS.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.089
SOME STILL DO, IN FACT -- AND IN

21:31.156 --> 21:31.790
MOST PLACES, IT'S GENERALLY BEEN

21:31.857 --> 21:33.625
PRETTY BAD.

21:33.692 --> 21:36.061
THAT "TREAT CANCER WITH PRAYER

21:36.128 --> 21:36.962
AND ENERGY DRINKS" STORY IS FROM

21:37.029 --> 21:37.863
WHEN ARIZONA RAN ITS OWN PRISON

21:37.929 --> 21:40.432
HEALTHCARE.

21:40.499 --> 21:41.566
BUT INCREASINGLY, STATES HAVE

21:41.633 --> 21:43.168
STARTED CONTRACTING CARE OUT TO

21:43.235 --> 21:45.270
PRIVATE COMPANIES.

21:45.337 --> 21:46.738
AS OF 2018, MORE THAN HALF OF

21:46.805 --> 21:49.307
ALL U.S. STATES HIRE PRIVATE

21:49.374 --> 21:51.610
COMPANIES TO PROVIDE AT LEAST

21:51.677 --> 21:52.444
SOME OF THEIR PRISON HEALTHCARE.

21:52.511 --> 21:53.612
AND WHEN IT COMES TO OUR LARGEST

21:53.679 --> 21:54.713
JAILS, THAT NUMBER IS MORE THAN

21:54.780 --> 21:55.414
60%, ALL OF WHICH EXPLAINS WHY

21:55.480 --> 21:58.483
THIS IS NOW A ROUGHLY $4 BILLION

21:58.550 --> 21:59.251
INDUSTRY.

21:59.317 --> 22:00.052
AND THE SELL COMPANIES MAKE IS

22:00.118 --> 22:01.753
THAT THEY CAN TAILOR CARE TO THE

22:01.820 --> 22:04.322
PARTICULAR NEEDS OF THE

22:04.389 --> 22:05.290
INCARCERATED -- A POPULATION

22:05.357 --> 22:06.391
THAT CAN HAVE HIGH RATES OF

22:06.458 --> 22:06.958
SUBSTANCE ABUSAND MENTAL

22:07.025 --> 22:07.993
ILESS, BOTH OF WHICH DO POSE

22:08.060 --> 22:11.530
SPECIAL CHALLENGES.

22:11.596 --> 22:12.764
JUST LISTEN TO THIS PROMO FOR

22:12.831 --> 22:13.632
ADVANCED CORRECTIONAL

22:13.699 --> 22:14.433
HEALTHCARE, WHICH SERVES

22:14.499 --> 22:17.102
FACILITIES IN 21 STATES, AS IT

22:17.169 --> 22:18.804
MAKES A VERY BIG PROMISE.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.672
>> THE PURPOSE OF ADVANCED

22:20.739 --> 22:22.574
CORRECTIONAL HEALTHCARE IS TO

22:22.641 --> 22:23.208
SOLVE PROBLEMS FOR OUR PATIENTS

22:23.275 --> 22:23.975
AND CLIENTS AND MAKE THEIR LIVES

22:24.042 --> 22:27.212
EASIER.

22:27.279 --> 22:28.947
IN FACT, OUR DATA INDICATES YOUR

22:29.014 --> 22:30.115
DETAINEES WILL BE HEALTHIER IN

22:30.182 --> 22:30.716
YOUR JAIL THAN THEY ARE WHEN

22:30.782 --> 22:32.918
THEY GO TO THEIR OWN DOCTORS.

22:32.984 --> 22:34.553
>> John: WELL, THAT DEFINITELY

22:34.619 --> 22:36.221
DOESN'T IMMEDIATELY SEEM LIKE

22:36.288 --> 22:37.155
BULLSHIT, DOES IT?

22:37.222 --> 22:37.989
FROM THE FACT SHE'S CITING

22:38.056 --> 22:38.590
"OUR DATA" TO THE FACT

22:38.657 --> 22:40.759
THAT, WHEN YOU'RE GOOGLING FOR

22:40.826 --> 22:43.962
"BEST DOCTORS NEAR ME," THE TOP

22:44.029 --> 22:45.330
RESULT IS VERY RARELY "HAVE YOU

22:45.397 --> 22:46.031
TRIED YOUR LOCAL JAIL?"

22:46.098 --> 22:46.965
AND UNSURPRISINGLY, THE ROSY

22:47.032 --> 22:47.999
PICTURE THAT PROMO PAINTS

22:48.066 --> 22:49.167
DOESN'T REMOTELY LIVE UP TO

22:49.234 --> 22:50.502
REALITY.

22:50.569 --> 22:51.770
TAKE THIS STORY FROM A WISCONSIN

22:51.837 --> 22:52.838
JAIL THAT USED THAT COMPANY'S

22:52.904 --> 22:55.107
SERVICES.

22:55.173 --> 22:57.242
>> SIX MONTHS AGO, 39-YEAR-OLD

22:57.309 --> 22:58.376
DANTE WILSON WAS IN A WISCONSIN

22:58.443 --> 23:02.214
JAIL FOR A CHILD SUPPORT

23:02.280 --> 23:03.148
VIOLATION.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.249
HE COMPLAINED OF CHEST PAINS.

23:04.316 --> 23:05.050
THE JAIL NURSE CONCLUDED HE HAD

23:05.117 --> 23:06.752
HEARTBURN AND GAVE HIM TWO TUMS.

23:06.818 --> 23:08.086
LESS THAN AN HOUR LATER, WILSON

23:08.153 --> 23:09.488
ASKED FOR HELP.

23:09.554 --> 23:10.722
AGAIN, "RELAX" WAS THE

23:10.789 --> 23:12.724
NURSE'S ADVICE.

23:12.791 --> 23:14.593
SOON AFTER, WILSON DIED OF A

23:14.659 --> 23:18.230
HEART ATTACK.

23:18.296 --> 23:19.965
LATER...

23:20.031 --> 23:20.866
>> [BLEEP] HAPPENS.

23:20.932 --> 23:23.235
>> THE NURSE WAS FIRED.

23:23.301 --> 23:23.568
>> John: GOOD!

23:23.635 --> 23:25.203
SHE SHOULD'VE BEEN!

23:25.270 --> 23:26.204
BECAUSE THAT IS THE SINGLE WORST

23:26.271 --> 23:26.938
THING YOU CAN POSSIBLY SAY IN

23:27.005 --> 23:29.341
RESPONSE TO SOMEONE DYING OF A

23:29.407 --> 23:29.975
HEART ATTACK BECAUSE YOU SCREWED

23:30.041 --> 23:31.543
UP.

23:31.610 --> 23:32.544
AND WHILE I'M SURE SHE WAS UPSET

23:32.611 --> 23:38.683
AT LOSING HER JOB, IF I SHARE A

23:38.750 --> 23:41.153
QUOTE THAT IT SEEMS THERE'S

23:41.219 --> 23:41.720
SIMPLY NO BAD TIME FOR,

23:41.787 --> 23:42.387
"SHIT FUCKING HAPPENS."

23:42.454 --> 23:43.688
AND AT THIS POINT, YOU WILL NOT

23:43.755 --> 23:44.289
BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT IN

23:44.356 --> 23:44.856
INTERNAL TRAININGS, ADVANCED

23:44.923 --> 23:46.291
CORRECTIONAL HEALTHCARE SEEMED

23:46.358 --> 23:46.925
TO SPEND AN UNNERVING AMOUNT OF

23:46.992 --> 23:48.293
TIME TEACHING ITS EMPLOYEES WHAT

23:48.360 --> 23:50.996
CONSTITUTES THE LEGAL BARE

23:51.062 --> 23:53.131
MINIMUM OF CARE.

23:53.198 --> 23:53.832
THAT ROUGH DRAFT JENNIFER GARNER

23:53.899 --> 23:56.268
WAX FIGURE ONCE CONDUCTED A

23:56.334 --> 23:58.904
VIDEO SEMINAR FOR STAFF TITLED

23:58.970 --> 24:01.807
"A JAIL IS NOT A HEALTH SPA."

24:01.873 --> 24:02.841
AND JUST WATCH HER EXPLAIN THE

24:02.908 --> 24:03.542
IMPORTANCE OF AVOIDING

24:03.608 --> 24:06.945
"DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE" --

24:07.012 --> 24:07.979
BASICALLY, NOT BLATANTLY

24:08.046 --> 24:08.613
NEGLECTING TO TREAT PRISONERS --

24:08.680 --> 24:10.415
BY USING THE WEIRDEST POSSIBLE

24:10.482 --> 24:12.851
EXAMPLE.

24:12.918 --> 24:14.019
>> SO, HOW DO WE DEFINE

24:14.085 --> 24:14.986
"DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE" NOW?

24:15.053 --> 24:15.987
YOU MUST KNOW OF AND DISREGARD

24:16.054 --> 24:17.522
AN EXCESSIVE RISK TO INMATE

24:17.589 --> 24:20.025
HEALTH OR SAFETY.

24:20.091 --> 24:22.327
SOMETHING WHICH WOULD CAUSE THE

24:22.394 --> 24:23.762
UNNECESSARY AND WANTON OR

24:23.829 --> 24:27.165
MALICIOUS INFLICTION OF PAIN.

24:27.232 --> 24:28.934
A FEW YEARS BACK, THERE WAS AN

24:29.000 --> 24:31.837
NBA PLAYER WHO WAS ARRESTED FOR

24:31.903 --> 24:33.004
SHOOTING A GUN INTO THE AIR FIVE

24:33.071 --> 24:34.940
TIMES OUTSIDE OF A STRIP CLUB.

24:35.006 --> 24:36.474
THAT IS CRIMINAL RECKLESSNESS.

24:36.541 --> 24:40.846
THAT IS CONSCIOUSLY DISREGARDING

24:40.912 --> 24:41.413
A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF HARM.

24:41.479 --> 24:42.781
A STRAY BULLET COULD HAVE HIT A

24:42.848 --> 24:44.082
STRIPPER.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.218
>> John: OKAY.

24:46.284 --> 24:48.820
THAT IS DEFINITELY AN EXAMPLE.

24:48.887 --> 24:50.088
ALTHOUGH, TO BE HONEST, IT ONLY

24:50.155 --> 24:50.622
REALLY MAKES SENSE IF SHE

24:50.689 --> 24:51.189
EXPLAINS EVERY LEGAL CONCEPT

24:51.256 --> 24:52.023
LIKE THAT.

24:52.090 --> 24:53.024
ABDUCTION?

24:53.091 --> 24:54.226
A STRIPPER GETS KIDNAPPED.

24:54.292 --> 24:55.060
BANKRUPTCY?

24:55.126 --> 24:56.561
A STRIPPER STOPS STRIPPING.

24:56.628 --> 24:57.662
ESCROW?

24:57.729 --> 24:58.964
A STRIPPER BUYS A HOUSE BUT

24:59.030 --> 24:59.798
ENLISTS A THIRD PARTY TO

24:59.865 --> 25:00.966
TEMPORARILY HOLD ASSETS UNTIL

25:01.032 --> 25:03.335
THE DEAL IS FINALIZED.

25:03.401 --> 25:04.536
NOW, YOU SHOULD KNOW, THAT WOMAN

25:04.603 --> 25:06.037
WAS THE COMPANY'S SENIOR

25:06.104 --> 25:06.872
COUNSEL.

25:06.938 --> 25:07.772
AND I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT

25:07.839 --> 25:09.140
SHE IS NO LONGER IN THAT ROLE.

25:09.207 --> 25:10.508
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE SHE'S

25:10.575 --> 25:12.644
NOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE WHOLE

25:12.711 --> 25:13.912
MOTHERFUCKING COMPANY, Y'ALL!

25:13.979 --> 25:17.616
[GUNSHOTS]

25:17.682 --> 25:17.816
WHOO!

25:17.883 --> 25:21.353
BUT THE PROBLEM ISN'T JUST WITH

25:21.419 --> 25:23.255
THIS ONE COMPANY.

25:23.321 --> 25:29.294
IT'S WITH THE WHOLE INDUSTRY.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.262
A REVIEW OF 500 JAILS FOUND

25:30.328 --> 25:30.795
THOSE RELYING ON THE FIVE

25:30.862 --> 25:31.663
LEADING CONTRACTORS HAD HIGHER

25:31.730 --> 25:32.631
DEATH RATES THAN FACILITIES RUN

25:32.697 --> 25:33.832
BY THE GOVERNMENT.

25:33.899 --> 25:34.366
AND ONE OF THE KEY REASONS

25:34.432 --> 25:35.400
COMPANIES SO OFTEN DELIVER

25:35.467 --> 25:37.102
SUBSTANDARD CARE IS THAT THEY'RE

25:37.168 --> 25:37.936
ACTIVELY INCENTIVIZED TO DUE TO

25:38.003 --> 25:40.405
HOW THEY'RE PAID.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.941
>> IT'S BASICALLY A FIXED DOLLAR

25:43.008 --> 25:44.643
AMOUNT CONTRACT.

25:44.709 --> 25:45.477
IT'S 16 DOLLARS AND CHANGE PER

25:45.543 --> 25:47.712
PRISONER, AND THE CONTRACT

25:47.779 --> 25:50.815
ASSUMES 34,000 PRISONERS.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.618
SO IT'S BASICALLY, THIS IS HOW

25:53.685 --> 25:55.854
MUCH WE'RE GIVING YOU.

25:55.921 --> 25:58.523
AND THE MORE MONEY YOU SPEND ON

25:58.590 --> 25:59.291
PROVIDING HEALTHCARE, THE LESS

25:59.357 --> 25:59.991
PROFIT YOU MAKE.

26:00.058 --> 26:01.559
>> John: RIGHT.

26:01.626 --> 26:02.193
AND THAT IS A PRETTY OBVIOUS

26:02.260 --> 26:03.228
INCENTIVE TO CUT CORNERS.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.030
IF YOU GIVE YOUR BABYSITTER $100

26:05.096 --> 26:06.631
AND SAY "WHATEVER YOU DON'T

26:06.698 --> 26:07.866
SPEND ON DINNER YOU CAN KEEP,"

26:07.933 --> 26:10.368
DON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU COME

26:10.435 --> 26:11.736
HOME TO A VERY HAPPY BABYSITTER

26:11.803 --> 26:13.605
AND A BUNCH OF PISSED-OFF KIDS

26:13.672 --> 26:14.572
EATING TOP RAMEN.

26:14.639 --> 26:16.308
AND THAT PROFIT MOTIVE HAS LED

26:16.374 --> 26:18.109
TO SOME PRETTY OUTRAGEOUS

26:18.176 --> 26:19.244
POLICIES.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.211
A RECENT COURT CASE AGAINST

26:20.278 --> 26:21.980
WEXFORD, ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S

26:22.047 --> 26:23.548
LARGEST PRISONER HEALTHCARE

26:23.615 --> 26:24.516
PROVIDERS, REVEALED THAT FOR

26:24.582 --> 26:25.483
YEARS IT HAD HAD A DE FACTO

26:25.550 --> 26:27.218
"ONE GOOD EYE" POLICY, AS WHEN A

26:27.285 --> 26:29.054
69-YEAR-OLD PRISONER GOT

26:29.120 --> 26:31.222
CATARACTS IN BOTH EYES AND

26:31.289 --> 26:32.357
WANTED THEM FIXED, THE PRISON

26:32.424 --> 26:33.191
DOCTOR TOLD HER THAT SHE'D HAVE

26:33.258 --> 26:34.326
TO MAKE A CHOICE.

26:34.392 --> 26:36.094
WHICH EYE DID SHE WANT FIXED,

26:36.161 --> 26:38.496
THE RIGHT ONE OR THE LEFT ONE?

26:38.563 --> 26:39.998
WHICH IS CLEARLY AN IMPOSSIBLE

26:40.065 --> 26:40.932
QUESTION.

26:40.999 --> 26:41.599
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE ASKING WHICH

26:41.666 --> 26:42.934
PROPERTY BROTHER YOU'D LIKE TO

26:43.001 --> 26:43.902
KILL.

26:43.969 --> 26:45.637
THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE RESPONSE TO

26:45.704 --> 26:46.838
EITHER QUESTION IS, "BOTH.

26:46.905 --> 26:50.475
WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME CHOOSE?"

26:50.542 --> 26:51.810
BUT TO SHOW JUST HOW DANGEROUS

26:51.876 --> 26:53.011
THESE COMPANIES CAN BE, LET'S

26:53.078 --> 26:57.282
JUST LOOK AT ONE STATE, ARIZONA.

26:57.349 --> 26:57.849
BACK IN 2009, IT ANNOUNCED A

26:57.916 --> 26:58.950
PLAN TO SWITCH FROM STATE CARE

26:59.017 --> 27:01.119
TO PRIVATE PROVIDERS.

27:01.186 --> 27:01.853
AND THE INITIAL PITCH WAS THAT

27:01.920 --> 27:04.155
THIS WOULD BE A COST-SAVING

27:04.222 --> 27:05.223
MEASURE.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.358
BUT AS THIS WOMAN EXPLAINS,

27:06.424 --> 27:07.459
SOMETHING INTERESTING HAPPENED

27:07.525 --> 27:09.127
FAIRLY EARLY ON.

27:09.194 --> 27:10.295
>> THEY PUT OUT A REQUEST FOR

27:10.362 --> 27:11.596
PROPOSALS, AN RFP, AND NOBODY

27:11.663 --> 27:13.565
BID FOR IT BECAUSE NOBODY COULD

27:13.631 --> 27:15.166
DO IT FOR LESS THAN WHAT THE

27:15.233 --> 27:17.268
STATE WAS SPENDING, BECAUSE THE

27:17.335 --> 27:18.470
STATE WASN'T SPENDING VERY MUCH

27:18.536 --> 27:19.170
AS IT IS.

27:19.237 --> 27:20.105
A COUPLE YEARS LATER, THE

27:20.171 --> 27:25.410
LEGISLATURE CAME BACK AND

27:25.477 --> 27:26.077
SAID, "UH, WE'RE GONNA AMEND

27:26.144 --> 27:26.644
THAT PRIOR LAW.

27:26.711 --> 27:27.278
REMEMBER WHERE WE SAID IT HAS TO

27:27.345 --> 27:27.946
BE LESS?

27:28.013 --> 27:28.680
IT'S OKAY.

27:28.747 --> 27:30.315
IT CAN COST MORE."

27:30.382 --> 27:31.383
>> John: OOH, IT CAN, CAN IT?

27:31.449 --> 27:32.717
SO YOU DEMANDED A COMPETITIVE

27:32.784 --> 27:33.318
BID, AND WHEN NO ONE RESPONDED,

27:33.385 --> 27:34.753
YOU ROLLED OVER AND GAVE UP

27:34.819 --> 27:37.155
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING.

27:37.222 --> 27:37.756
IT'S A SHREWD TACTIC FROM THE

27:37.822 --> 27:38.356
FAMOUS BOOK ON NEGOTIATING,

27:38.423 --> 27:38.957
"THIS IS WHERE I'M SOFTEST AND

27:39.024 --> 27:42.027
OTHER BUSINESS IDEAS

27:42.093 --> 27:45.730
BY A TIMID PUPPY."

27:45.797 --> 27:48.466
BUT SINCE THEN, IT HAS BEEN A

27:48.533 --> 27:49.000
NIGHTMARE, AS ARIZONA HAS

27:49.067 --> 27:49.567
CYCLED THROUGH CONTRACTORS.

27:49.634 --> 27:53.772
THEY STARTED WITH WEXFORD,

27:53.838 --> 27:54.839
THE "ONE GOOD EYE" PEOPLE.

27:54.906 --> 27:55.440
BUT AS THINGS DIDN'T IMPROVE,

27:55.507 --> 27:56.174
LESS THAN A YEAR LATER, THEY

27:56.241 --> 27:56.775
SWITCHED TO A COMPANY CALLED

27:56.841 --> 27:57.075
CORIZON.

27:57.142 --> 27:58.043
BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, HEINOUS

27:58.109 --> 27:58.943
STORIES STARTED EMERGING ABOUT

27:59.010 --> 27:59.611
THE CARE THEY WERE PROVIDING

27:59.677 --> 28:01.112
TOO, INCLUDING ONE WE'VE

28:01.179 --> 28:02.313
ACTUALLY SHOWN YOU BEFORE, ABOUT

28:02.380 --> 28:03.748
A WOMAN WHO GAVE BIRTH BEHIND

28:03.815 --> 28:05.450
BARS AND WHOSE C-SECTION WOUND

28:05.517 --> 28:06.851
HAD NOT FULLY HEALED.

28:06.918 --> 28:08.620
AND I'LL LET HER MOTHER PICK UP

28:08.686 --> 28:10.488
THE STORY FROM THERE.

28:10.555 --> 28:11.556
>> THEY DECIDED SHE HAD BEEN

28:11.623 --> 28:12.824
THERE LONG ENOUGH THAT SHE COULD

28:12.891 --> 28:14.025
GO BACK TO HER YARD.

28:14.092 --> 28:15.160
BUT IT WAS STILL OPEN A LITTLE

28:15.226 --> 28:17.962
BIT.

28:18.029 --> 28:20.065
AND SO THEY DECIDED THAT, UM,

28:20.131 --> 28:20.832
THE BEST THING TO DO FOR THIS

28:20.899 --> 28:21.466
WOULD BE TO PACK IT WITH KITCHEN

28:21.533 --> 28:22.567
SUGAR.

28:22.634 --> 28:23.768
>> SUGAR?

28:23.835 --> 28:26.671
>> SUGAR.

28:26.738 --> 28:28.173
AND, WE'RE TALKING SUGAR THAT

28:28.239 --> 28:30.175
YOU GET FROM -- 'CAUSE THEY

28:30.241 --> 28:31.009
DONATE IT, FROM McDONALD'S, FROM

28:31.076 --> 28:32.777
BURGER KING.

28:32.844 --> 28:33.745
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE STANDING THERE

28:33.812 --> 28:35.080
RIPPING OPEN THESE LITTLE PACKS

28:35.146 --> 28:38.650
OF SUGAR AND FILLING THAT WOUND.

28:38.716 --> 28:40.085
PACKING IT IN WITH WHAT'S LEFT,

28:40.151 --> 28:42.220
AND --

28:42.287 --> 28:42.821
>> WITH SUGAR FROM A FAST FOOD

28:42.887 --> 28:43.388
RESTAURANT.

28:43.455 --> 28:44.255
>> YES.

28:44.322 --> 28:45.356
>> John: OKAY.

28:45.423 --> 28:46.091
LET ME BE CLEAR: I'M NOT A

28:46.157 --> 28:47.792
DOCTOR -- ALTHOUGH IF YOU PUT ME

28:47.859 --> 28:49.294
IN A LAB COAT, I DO THINK I

28:49.360 --> 28:50.295
COULD GET AWAY WITH IT FOR

28:50.361 --> 28:51.429
TWO TO SIX WEEKS.

28:51.496 --> 28:52.630
I HAVE AN ACCENT AND KNOW HOW TO

28:52.697 --> 28:53.832
SAY "SUBDURAL HEMATOMA" --

28:53.898 --> 28:54.732
I'M BASICALLY HALFWAY THERE

28:54.799 --> 28:56.134
ALREADY.

28:56.201 --> 28:57.735
BUT IF I HAD TO PICK THE WORST

28:57.802 --> 29:00.338
POSSIBLE THING FOR A PERSON

29:00.405 --> 29:01.372
RECOVERING FROM THE TRAUMA OF

29:01.439 --> 29:01.940
CHILDBIRTH, IT'D PROBABLY BE

29:02.006 --> 29:02.807
INJECTING McDONALD'S SUGAR

29:02.874 --> 29:04.642
STRAIGHT INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM.

29:04.709 --> 29:06.077
AND THE STATE LAWMAKER WHO

29:06.144 --> 29:07.545
SPEARHEADED THE MOVE TO TAKE

29:07.612 --> 29:09.013
ARIZONA'S PRISON HEALTHCARE

29:09.080 --> 29:10.982
PRIVATE, JOHN KAVANAGH, DIDN'T

29:11.049 --> 29:12.250
DISPLAY A GREAT DEAL OF EMPATHY

29:12.317 --> 29:14.452
WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THAT STORY.

29:14.519 --> 29:15.854
>> THAT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.055
YOU KNOW, PRISONERS HAVE, YOU

29:17.122 --> 29:18.990
KNOW, 24/7 TO THINK UP

29:19.057 --> 29:20.859
ALLEGATIONS AND WRITE LETTERS.

29:20.925 --> 29:23.027
I'M NOT SAYING THAT SOME OF THEM

29:23.094 --> 29:24.395
CAN'T HAVE A BASIS IN FACT, BUT

29:24.462 --> 29:25.497
YOU GOTTA TAKE THEM WITH A GRAIN

29:25.563 --> 29:27.065
OF SALT, OR IN THE CASE OF THE

29:27.132 --> 29:27.899
HOSPITAL, MAYBE A GRAIN OF

29:27.966 --> 29:28.933
SUGAR.

29:29.000 --> 29:29.968
>> John: OH, I GET IT!

29:30.034 --> 29:31.035
A JOKE!

29:31.102 --> 29:32.837
PRISON GEPPETTO HERE IS HAVING

29:32.904 --> 29:34.539
SOME FUN WITH WORDS.

29:34.606 --> 29:35.473
AND I'M SURE THAT PRISONER'S

29:35.540 --> 29:36.841
SIDES WERE SPLITTING.

29:36.908 --> 29:37.976
LESS FROM LAUGHTER, THOUGH, AND

29:38.042 --> 29:39.410
MORE FROM THE OPEN WOUNDS THAT,

29:39.477 --> 29:40.278
THANKS TO HIM, SHE'D HAD FILLED

29:40.345 --> 29:42.413
WITH FUCKING SUGAR.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.415
AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF MANY

29:44.482 --> 29:45.917
STORIES OF CORIZON PROVIDING

29:45.984 --> 29:47.585
ABYSMAL CARE, SEEMINGLY IN ORDER

29:47.652 --> 29:49.921
TO CUT COSTS.

29:49.988 --> 29:51.356
NOT ONLY WERE THEY REPEATEDLY

29:51.422 --> 29:52.490
ACCUSED OF REFUSING TO PAY

29:52.557 --> 29:54.292
SPECIALISTS, CAUSING HOSPITALS

29:54.359 --> 29:55.660
TO HAVE TO SEND EMAILS LIKE THIS

29:55.727 --> 29:56.461
ONE, IN WHICH THEY LITERALLY BEG

29:56.528 --> 29:58.096
FOR PAYMENT.

29:58.163 --> 29:59.264
BUT WHEN A CORIZON DOCTOR WAS

29:59.330 --> 30:00.932
DEALING WITH A PRISONER WHO'D

30:00.999 --> 30:02.267
HAD MULTIPLE SEIZURES AND

30:02.333 --> 30:03.735
SUGGESTED SENDING HIM OUT FOR AN

30:03.801 --> 30:06.638
EXAM, SHE WAS TOLD THAT WAS NOT

30:06.704 --> 30:07.372
GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT THAT THEY'D

30:07.438 --> 30:08.206
"ORDER A HELMET FOR HIM TO

30:08.273 --> 30:09.474
PROTECT HIS HEAD INSTEAD."

30:09.541 --> 30:12.010
AND WHILE IT IS CLEARLY NOT THE

30:12.076 --> 30:13.511
MOST IMPORTANT THING, WE TRACKED

30:13.578 --> 30:15.346
THAT DOCTOR DOWN TO ASK IF THEY

30:15.413 --> 30:16.614
EVER GOT THAT HELMET FOR HIM,

30:16.681 --> 30:17.415
AND YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT THE

30:17.482 --> 30:18.183
ANSWER WAS, UNLESS YOUR GUESS IS

30:18.249 --> 30:19.250
"NO," IN WHICH CASE, YOU'RE

30:19.317 --> 30:22.520
ABSOLUTELY FUCKING RIGHT.

30:22.587 --> 30:23.988
AND ALL OF THIS LED TO HORRIFIC

30:24.055 --> 30:26.124
CONSEQUENCES, LIKE THIS MAN,

30:26.191 --> 30:27.192
WHO HAD JUST TEN MONTHS LEFT ON

30:27.258 --> 30:28.159
HIS SENTENCE FOR VEHICLE THEFT

30:28.226 --> 30:30.428
WHEN HE COMPLAINED OF BACK PAIN.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.129
FOUR MONTHS LATER, HE FINALLY

30:31.196 --> 30:32.730
GOT X-RAYS DONE WHICH SHOWED

30:32.797 --> 30:33.731
SIGNS OF CANCER -- BUT EVEN

30:33.798 --> 30:36.367
THEN, CORIZON DRAGGED ITS FEET.

30:36.434 --> 30:38.002
>> THEY WOULDN'T DO AN MRI.

30:38.069 --> 30:38.970
THEY KEPT DENYING AN MRI,

30:39.037 --> 30:40.505
DENYING AN MRI.

30:40.572 --> 30:41.806
>> IN MAY, CT SCANS WERE ORDERED

30:41.873 --> 30:43.474
TO SEE IF VOCKE HAD CANCER, BUT

30:43.541 --> 30:45.877
CORIZON DENIED IT.

30:45.944 --> 30:47.579
FINALLY, AT THE END OF JULY

30:47.645 --> 30:50.181
2013, A CT SCAN WAS PERFORMED.

30:50.248 --> 30:52.684
IT CONFIRMED VOCKE HAD CANCER.

30:52.750 --> 30:53.685
MEDICAL RECORDS SHOW THERE WAS A

30:53.751 --> 30:55.086
LENGTHY DELAY IN TREATING

30:55.153 --> 30:57.388
VOCKE.

30:57.455 --> 30:59.023
>> AND IT WAS KIDNEY CANCER THAT

30:59.090 --> 31:01.059
COULD HAVE BEEN 95% SURVIVABLE.

31:01.125 --> 31:02.527
AND NOW THEY'RE SAYING THAT I

31:02.594 --> 31:03.895
CAN'T SURVIVE IT WHATSOEVER.

31:03.962 --> 31:05.263
>> VOCKE WAS GRANTED MEDICAL

31:05.330 --> 31:07.165
PAROLE SO HE CAN DIE SURROUNDED

31:07.232 --> 31:09.133
BY FAMILY.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.802
>> John: THAT IS A TRAGEDY.

31:10.868 --> 31:12.370
JUST TEN MONTHS LEFT ON HIS

31:12.437 --> 31:14.272
SENTENCE, SHOWING CLEAR SIGNS OF

31:14.339 --> 31:17.175
CANCER, AND NOTHING WAS DONE.

31:17.242 --> 31:19.444
AND AGAIN, HE WAS IN THERE FOR

31:19.510 --> 31:20.511
VEHICLE THEFT.

31:20.578 --> 31:21.045
THE PUNISHMENT FOR THAT IS

31:21.112 --> 31:21.913
CLEARLY NOT DEATH, BUT UNDER A

31:21.980 --> 31:23.648
SYSTEM THIS CRUEL, IT CAN TURN

31:23.715 --> 31:24.582
OUT TO BE.

31:24.649 --> 31:26.384
AND THIS WAS ALL PART OF A

31:26.451 --> 31:26.884
CONSISTENT PATTERN.

31:26.951 --> 31:28.553
THE STATE'S OWN RECORDS SHOWED

31:28.620 --> 31:29.487
THAT CORIZON HAD DELAYED

31:29.554 --> 31:32.190
DELIVERY OF MEDICAL CARE 16,000

31:32.257 --> 31:33.725
TIMES IN JUST ONE EIGHT-MONTH

31:33.791 --> 31:34.959
PERIOD.

31:35.026 --> 31:36.461
IT GOT SO BAD, ARIZONA WAS

31:36.527 --> 31:38.830
ACTUALLY FORCED TO PAY FINES FOR

31:38.896 --> 31:39.764
THE SUBSTANDARD CARE PRISONERS

31:39.831 --> 31:41.299
RECEIVED EVEN AS, MYSTIFYINGLY,

31:41.366 --> 31:42.667
IT CONTINUED TO PAY MORE THAN

31:42.734 --> 31:43.835
$2.5 MILLION IN PERFORMANCE

31:43.901 --> 31:46.904
BONUSES TO CORIZON'S EXECUTIVES.

31:46.971 --> 31:48.506
BUT EVENTUALLY ENOUGH WAS

31:48.573 --> 31:49.674
ENOUGH, AND THE STATE GOT RID OF

31:49.741 --> 31:50.808
CORIZON.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.443
THE COMPANY -- FUN FACT -- HAS

31:52.510 --> 31:54.045
SINCE DECLARED BANKRUPTCY, BUT

31:54.112 --> 31:55.413
REBRANDED AS "YESCARE," WHICH IS

31:55.480 --> 31:58.349
A BOLD NAME CHOICE FOR THAT

31:58.416 --> 32:00.051
COMPANY.

32:00.118 --> 32:01.052
IT'S LIKE APPLEBEES CALLING

32:01.119 --> 32:01.853
ITSELF "WON'T MAKE YOU POOP

32:01.919 --> 32:03.221
WEIRD!"

32:03.288 --> 32:08.760
TO PUT IT MILDLY, YOUR NAME

32:08.826 --> 32:09.727
IS A LITTLE MISLEADING.

32:09.794 --> 32:10.928
ANYWAY, ARIZONA REPLACED CORIZON

32:10.995 --> 32:11.562
WITH A COMPANY CALLED CENTURION.

32:11.629 --> 32:12.163
BUT THE SITUATION STILL DIDN'T

32:12.230 --> 32:12.397
IMPROVE.

32:12.463 --> 32:13.498
IN FACT, LAST JUNE, A

32:13.564 --> 32:14.599
JUDGE RULED THAT FOR YEARS,

32:14.666 --> 32:16.601
ACROSS MULTIPLE PROVIDERS, THE

32:16.668 --> 32:17.302
STATE HAD SHOWN "THE MOST

32:17.368 --> 32:18.536
CALLOUS AND INHUMANE

32:18.603 --> 32:19.937
INDIFFERENCE," SAYING "NO

32:20.004 --> 32:21.539
LEGITIMATE HUMANE SYSTEM WOULD

32:21.606 --> 32:23.007
OPERATE IN THIS MANNER."

32:23.074 --> 32:24.676
NOW, SINCE THAT RULING, THE

32:24.742 --> 32:25.910
STATE'S CONTRACTED OUT TO YET

32:25.977 --> 32:27.845
ANOTHER NEW PROVIDER, THIS ONE

32:27.912 --> 32:29.781
CALLED NAPHCARE, WHICH ITSELF IS

32:29.847 --> 32:30.782
FIGHTING ACCUSATIONS OF FORCIBLY

32:30.848 --> 32:31.816
INDUCING PREGNANT PRISONERS INTO

32:31.883 --> 32:33.584
LABOR AGAINST THEIR WILL.

32:33.651 --> 32:35.920
AND THAT'S THE THING -- IN SO

32:35.987 --> 32:38.222
MANY PLACES, STATES END UP JUST

32:38.289 --> 32:39.290
ROTATING AMONG A SMALL HANDFUL

32:39.357 --> 32:47.098
OF AWFUL PROVIDERS.

32:47.165 --> 32:48.633
PRISONS IN FLORIDA WENT FROM

32:48.700 --> 32:49.367
CORIZON, TO WEXFORD, TO

32:49.434 --> 32:50.134
CENTURION.

32:50.201 --> 32:50.702
ALABAMA WENT FROM CORIZON TO

32:50.768 --> 32:51.502
WEXFORD, TO YESCARE, WHICH,

32:51.569 --> 32:52.103
YOU'LL REMEMBER, IS BASICALLY

32:52.170 --> 32:53.671
JUST CORIZON REBRANDED.

32:53.738 --> 32:56.174
SO STATES CHOOSE HEALTHCARE

32:56.240 --> 32:56.708
PROVIDERS LIKE OLD MARRIED

32:56.774 --> 32:58.643
COUPLES CHOOSE SEXUAL POSITIONS:

32:58.710 --> 33:00.011
BY CYCLING THROUGH AN EXTREMELY

33:00.078 --> 33:01.412
LIMITED NUMBER OF OPTIONS, NONE

33:01.479 --> 33:03.314
OF WHICH REALLY GET THE JOB DONE

33:03.381 --> 33:05.950
IN A SATISFYING WAY.

33:06.017 --> 33:06.851
AND THE OPTIONS CAN BE SO

33:06.918 --> 33:08.286
LIMITED THAT, EVEN WHEN PUBLIC

33:08.353 --> 33:16.361
OFFICIALS DO TRY TO DO THE RIGHT

33:16.427 --> 33:17.428
THING AND DEMAND ACTION, THEY

33:17.495 --> 33:18.896
CAN OFTEN FIND THEMSELVES STUCK.

33:18.963 --> 33:19.364
TAKE WHAT HAPPENED IN

33:19.430 --> 33:20.565
FORSYTH COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA.

33:20.631 --> 33:21.199
IT HAD A CONTRACT WITH A COMPANY

33:21.265 --> 33:21.866
CALLED CORRECT CARE SOLUTIONS TO

33:21.933 --> 33:22.600
PROVIDE CARE IN ITS JAIL.

33:22.667 --> 33:23.801
BUT AFTER A SERIES OF

33:23.868 --> 33:24.902
CALAMITIES, INCLUDING TWO MEN

33:24.969 --> 33:25.636
DYING IN THE SPACE OF JUST 24

33:25.703 --> 33:26.704
DAYS, THIS COUNTY COMMISSIONER

33:26.771 --> 33:27.772
DECIDED TO VOTE AGAINST RENEWING

33:27.839 --> 33:29.374
THEIR CONTRACT, AND DID SO LIKE

33:29.440 --> 33:31.809
THIS:

33:31.876 --> 33:33.544
>> I CAN'T VOTE TO SUPPORT

33:33.611 --> 33:35.847
CORRECT CARE FOR ANY CONTRACT.

33:35.913 --> 33:38.483
YOU KNOW, I DON'T CARE ABOUT

33:38.549 --> 33:39.817
THREE MILLION, THREE YEARS, OR

33:39.884 --> 33:40.318
WHATEVER.

33:40.385 --> 33:41.986
I WOULDN'T GIVE CORRECT --

33:42.053 --> 33:43.721
CORRECT CARE SOLUTIONS $3,000

33:43.788 --> 33:45.123
FOR THREE DAYS IF I HAD MY WAY.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.524
SO I CAN'T SUPPORT IT.

33:46.591 --> 33:47.859
>> John: THAT'S A PRETTY STRONG

33:47.925 --> 33:50.762
"NO" FROM THAT MAN.

33:50.828 --> 33:51.996
AND AS COMPLETELY JUSTIFIABLE

33:52.063 --> 33:52.997
AS HIS RELUCTANCE TO RENEW

33:53.064 --> 33:54.899
CORRECT CARE'S CONTRACT WAS, AS

33:54.966 --> 33:56.000
THE COUNTY'S DEPUTY SHERIFF

33:56.067 --> 33:56.968
POINTED OUT, THERE WAS A BIT OF

33:57.034 --> 34:01.072
A PROBLEM.

34:01.139 --> 34:02.039
>> THE ONLY THING I WILL

34:02.106 --> 34:03.808
SAY, SIR, IS, WITH REGARD TO

34:03.875 --> 34:04.409
THIS, THIS WAS -- CORRECT CARE

34:04.475 --> 34:07.078
WAS THE ONLY VENDOR THAT BID.

34:07.145 --> 34:08.446
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

34:08.513 --> 34:09.580
THERE WAS NO OTHER OPTION.

34:09.647 --> 34:10.548
SO THE WHOLE VOTE WAS BASICALLY

34:10.615 --> 34:13.084
CEREMONIAL.

34:13.151 --> 34:14.051
IT'D BE JUST AS EFFECTIVE TO

34:14.118 --> 34:15.553
HOLD A VOTE ON THE QUESTION

34:15.620 --> 34:16.087
"SHOULD IT BE SUMMER NOW?"

34:16.154 --> 34:16.521
YES?

34:16.587 --> 34:17.422
YES?

34:17.488 --> 34:22.460
EVERYONE VOTES YES?

34:22.527 --> 34:23.394
WELL, BAD NEWS, EVERYONE,

34:23.461 --> 34:24.128
IT STILL ISN'T.

34:24.195 --> 34:24.662
AND WHEN YOU PUT ALL THIS

34:24.729 --> 34:25.263
TOGETHER, IT'S HARD TO ESCAPE

34:25.329 --> 34:25.863
TWO CONCLUSIONS: THAT ALL THE

34:25.930 --> 34:26.464
OPTIONS CURRENTLY ON THE TABLE

34:26.531 --> 34:27.198
ARE BAD AND THAT THE REASON

34:27.265 --> 34:28.332
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO BE SO BAD IS

34:28.399 --> 34:29.967
BECAUSE OF WHO THIS CARE IS FOR.

34:30.034 --> 34:32.069
AND I GET IT CAN BE DIFFICULT

34:32.136 --> 34:34.572
FOR SOME TO CARE ABOUT ISSUES

34:34.639 --> 34:35.940
AFFECTING PRISONERS.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.875
AND I ALSO GET THEIR HEALTH CARE

34:37.942 --> 34:39.277
MAY BE ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT TO

34:39.343 --> 34:40.111
RALLY AROUND, AS SO MANY ON THE

34:40.178 --> 34:42.013
OUTSIDE DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE

34:42.079 --> 34:42.914
THEMSELVES.

34:42.980 --> 34:43.915
I KNOW ALL OF THIS.

34:43.981 --> 34:44.916
BUT THE FACT REMAINS:

34:44.982 --> 34:47.885
PRISONERS ARE PEOPLE.

34:47.952 --> 34:50.354
100% OF THEM ARE, IN FACT.

34:50.421 --> 34:50.922
AND THERE ARE SOME SOLUTIONS

34:50.988 --> 34:53.357
HERE.

34:53.424 --> 34:53.958
I'D ARGUE THE BARE MINIMUM WE

34:54.025 --> 34:54.959
SHOULD DO IS TO STOP OUTSOURCING

34:55.026 --> 34:55.660
PRISON HEALTHCARE TO PRIVATE

34:55.726 --> 34:57.395
COMPANIES.

34:57.462 --> 34:58.663
AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL

34:58.729 --> 35:00.598
PRISON PROJECT AT THE ACLU PUTS

35:00.665 --> 35:01.532
IT, "GOVERNMENT-RUN PRISON

35:01.599 --> 35:02.500
HEALTH CARE IS OFTEN APPALLINGLY

35:02.567 --> 35:03.501
DEFICIENT, BUT AT LEAST WHEN A

35:03.568 --> 35:04.702
GOVERNMENT IS PROVIDING THE

35:04.769 --> 35:06.604
SERVICE, THERE IS SOME MEASURE

35:06.671 --> 35:08.105
OF OVERSIGHT."

35:08.172 --> 35:09.173
AND IT SHOULD SAY SOMETHING

35:09.240 --> 35:10.775
ABOUT JUST HOW BAD THINGS ARE

35:10.842 --> 35:12.009
THAT WHAT ACTIVISTS ARE PUSHING

35:12.076 --> 35:13.377
FOR HERE IS THE "APPALLINGLY

35:13.444 --> 35:15.179
DEFICIENT" OPTION.

35:15.246 --> 35:17.381
AND LOOK, OBVIOUSLY, THE PROBLEM

35:17.448 --> 35:18.716
IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN JUST

35:18.783 --> 35:20.218
SHITTY CONTRACTORS.

35:20.284 --> 35:21.285
IF THE ISSUE IS THAT PRISONS ARE

35:21.352 --> 35:22.453
OVERWHELMED WITH TOO MANY

35:22.520 --> 35:24.889
PATIENTS TO TAKE CARE OF,

35:24.956 --> 35:25.823
MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE FEWER

35:25.890 --> 35:27.391
PEOPLE IN THERE.

35:27.458 --> 35:28.326
IF IT'S THAT THE PRISON

35:28.392 --> 35:29.527
POPULATION IS GETTING OLDER

35:29.594 --> 35:30.161
BECAUSE OF THE INCREDIBLY LONG

35:30.228 --> 35:30.962
SENTENCES WE'VE IMPOSED UPON

35:31.028 --> 35:33.464
PEOPLE, MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER

35:33.531 --> 35:34.532
RELEASING THEM.

35:34.599 --> 35:36.801
IF IT'S THAT TOO MANY OF THEM

35:36.868 --> 35:37.468
ARE DEALING WITH ADDICTION AND

35:37.535 --> 35:38.603
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS,

35:38.669 --> 35:39.637
MAYBE WE SHOULD BE EXAMINING

35:39.704 --> 35:43.074
WHETHER PRISON IS THE BEST PLACE

35:43.140 --> 35:44.242
TO TREAT THOSE CONDITIONS.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.309
BECAUSE THE THING IS, IT'S

35:45.376 --> 35:46.878
IMPOSSIBLE TO SEPARATE THIS

35:46.944 --> 35:48.913
ISSUE FROM THE MUCH LARGER

35:48.980 --> 35:50.114
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT UNIVERSAL

35:50.181 --> 35:51.082
HEALTHCARE AND PRISON ABOLITION.

35:51.148 --> 35:52.683

35:52.750 --> 35:55.453

35:55.520 --> 35:56.521
PERPETUAL ELEPHANTS IN THE ROOM,

35:56.587 --> 35:57.154
THAT THE U.S. DOESN'T GUARANTEE

35:57.221 --> 35:57.955
ANY OF ITS CITIZENS THE DIGNITY

35:58.022 --> 35:59.190
OF GOOD HEALTHCARE, AND PUTS TOO

35:59.257 --> 36:00.658
MANY OF ITS PEOPLE IN CAGES --

36:00.725 --> 36:02.026
CAGES WHERE MANY WILL NEEDLESSLY

36:02.093 --> 36:04.295
DIE.

36:04.362 --> 36:06.163
