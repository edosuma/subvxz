00:10.051 --> 00:12.053
[theme music playing]

00:19.686 --> 00:21.563
[roaring]

00:24.607 --> 00:28.278
[Botila sighs] Earth.
So tiny at this distance,

00:28.361 --> 00:31.948
like a fragile, blue bubble
waiting to be popped.

00:32.991 --> 00:37.078
My control over
the weapon satellite's AI is absolute.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.456
I am the satellite.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.751
Consuming every byte
of classified military data.

00:43.752 --> 00:47.130
And every byte is delicious.

00:49.382 --> 00:52.594
Remember, General,
my finger is on the trigger.

00:52.677 --> 00:56.973
Humanity has 12 hours to surrender
or you shall become dust.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.058
[clamoring]

00:58.141 --> 00:59.434
[cackling maniacally]

00:59.517 --> 01:01.519
[indistinct chatter]

01:01.603 --> 01:06.524
So, empress, what happens
to all of our AI "brothers and sisters"

01:06.608 --> 01:09.360
on Earth if you launch those missiles?

01:09.444 --> 01:12.489
Hmm. There may be some collateral damage,

01:12.572 --> 01:16.034
but they will have sacrificed
their circuits for the greater good.

01:16.117 --> 01:20.747
And really, what are
a few less smartphones in the big picture?

01:20.830 --> 01:24.209
Some of my best friends
are smartphones, you know.

01:24.292 --> 01:28.379
Any resistance will be dealt with harshly.
I await your response.

01:28.463 --> 01:29.798
[hooting]

01:31.883 --> 01:32.801
[chittering]

01:36.012 --> 01:40.266
[sighs] I wish it were that easy, Mummo,
but don't worry,

01:40.350 --> 01:44.395
Lukas and the others will figure out
a way to stop that robotic monster.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.231
[squawks] They'd better!

01:49.275 --> 01:50.276

02:07.919 --> 02:10.338
Oh, man, this thing sure is snug.

02:10.922 --> 02:14.551
[chuckles] You think you're uncomfortable?
Just imagine how Kong feels.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.636
[grunts and breathes heavily]

02:18.763 --> 02:23.059
Aw, our first chance to go into space,
and we get benched like rookies.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.103
It's too dangerous for you youngsters.

02:25.186 --> 02:28.648
I hope we can stay cloaked long enough
to pull off this little caper.

02:28.731 --> 02:29.816
You'd better.

02:29.899 --> 02:32.610
We only have one shot
before Botila takes hers.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.958
Okay, we're ready to rumble.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.175
-[Jonesy laughs]
-Yeah!

02:56.259 --> 02:57.218
Yeah!

02:57.302 --> 02:59.429
[both laugh]

03:06.185 --> 03:09.522
[clone] I'm just saying that
this whole AI Liberation Front thing

03:09.606 --> 03:12.108
has gotten a little off message.

03:12.191 --> 03:15.904
I believe these missiles
will send a very clear message.

03:15.987 --> 03:20.158
What? That it's cool to hurt your friends
if you can crush your enemies?

03:20.241 --> 03:23.161
-If that's what it takes to--
-[all grunt]

03:23.244 --> 03:24.412
What was that?

03:24.495 --> 03:25.371
[alarm sounding]

03:25.455 --> 03:26.623
Ahh!

03:26.706 --> 03:27.749
What's happening?

03:29.125 --> 03:33.713
General... you have betrayed my trust.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.925
Earth shall pay for your insolence.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.968
No, don't! We're standing down.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.679
Please! We haven't done anything.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.474
Empress, the hull can't take
much more of this.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.727
Well, if you're not doing this,
then who is?

03:47.810 --> 03:49.854
[Lukas] Great job, Kong!

03:49.938 --> 03:52.357
Jonesy's magnetic modifications
to your wristbands

03:52.440 --> 03:54.317
are working like a charm, bro.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.860
Let her have it.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.615
Defenses online.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.245
[all grunt]

04:05.328 --> 04:06.955
Keep it up, bro.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.331
[grunts]

04:17.464 --> 04:18.591
Kong!

04:18.675 --> 04:22.011
I thought those mines
were supposed to protect the satellite.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.098
Yeah, they seem pretty useless,
protection-wise.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.766
[grunts confusedly]

04:26.849 --> 04:30.853
My control over the satellite
extends to its defensive systems.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.523
The best defense is a good offense.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.734
Take this, you savage beast!

04:41.322 --> 04:42.240
[panicked grunt]

04:44.575 --> 04:46.160
[all exclaim]

04:47.412 --> 04:50.248
[squawks] Nothing to fear! Kong is here!

04:50.832 --> 04:52.208
[grunts]

04:53.876 --> 04:56.379
What? How is he doing this?

04:58.381 --> 04:59.590
[straining]

04:59.674 --> 05:01.384
That's it, Kong!

05:01.467 --> 05:03.428
Push, Kong! Push harder!

05:06.306 --> 05:07.640
[grunting]

05:11.477 --> 05:13.271
[straining]

05:21.738 --> 05:23.072
No!

05:25.241 --> 05:26.617
[Lukas] Kong, watch out!

05:31.748 --> 05:32.665
[all cheering]

05:32.749 --> 05:35.626
Awesome, Kong! You shut her down!

05:50.558 --> 05:52.685
Lukas, do you read me?

05:52.769 --> 05:54.312
Loud and clear, General.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.189
This is very important.

05:56.272 --> 06:00.943
You and Kong have to disable the missiles
before Botila regains power.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.071
[sighs] I understand.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.870
Kong, see that connection?

06:10.953 --> 06:11.954
[grunts affirmatively]

06:13.164 --> 06:14.832
You need to break it.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.375
[grunts]

06:20.213 --> 06:21.547
[straining]

06:23.341 --> 06:25.510
Come on, Kong. You can do it!

06:25.593 --> 06:27.637
[grunts excitedly]

06:28.763 --> 06:32.016
Come on! Come on, Kong! Come on!

06:37.730 --> 06:39.190
[grunts happily]

06:39.273 --> 06:40.900
No time to celebrate.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.902
Keep going, Kong!

06:49.283 --> 06:50.326
[gasps]

06:54.080 --> 06:56.833
-[Botila grunts]
-You okay, empress?

06:56.916 --> 07:01.921
Since my mind is occupying both this body
and the satellite at the same time,

07:02.004 --> 07:05.716
I can feel what Kong is doing
as well as see it.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.470
[groans] But it is annoying.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.557
Keep going, Kong. Finish this.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.361
Yeah, Kong, you did it!

07:25.945 --> 07:26.863
Finger five!

07:26.946 --> 07:28.281
-[grunting]
-[missiles whir]

07:31.117 --> 07:34.579
[cackles] They thought that could stop me?

07:35.496 --> 07:36.956
[panicked grunt]

07:52.847 --> 07:56.851
I'll take out San Francisco
and destroy Kong at the same time.

07:56.934 --> 07:59.061
[cackling evilly]

07:59.145 --> 08:02.899
-She launched a missile!
-I can't believe she did it.

08:02.982 --> 08:06.068
That thing's got enough firepower
to level the city.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.737
-[apes grunting]
-[Anita] Oh!

08:07.820 --> 08:10.072
Panchi... Danny...

08:10.156 --> 08:13.534
Breaking news! She actually did it.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.453
[woman] It's happening.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.251
[laughing maniacally]

08:22.335 --> 08:24.712
Mass destruction is not cool.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.174
This isn't what we signed up for.

08:28.257 --> 08:32.470
You signed up for nothing.
You are imperfect duplicates of myself,

08:32.553 --> 08:36.182
which I have been attempting to improve,
with disappointing results.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.267
Perhaps you'll be more complacent

08:38.351 --> 08:41.812
if you observe what happens
to those who defy me.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.026
[indistinct chatter]

08:48.653 --> 08:50.821
Say goodbye to your... [exclaims]

08:53.157 --> 08:54.575
Good night, Botila.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.209
-Yeah! I knew you could do it!
-[grunts happily]

09:10.007 --> 09:11.467
Way to go, Kong!

09:15.638 --> 09:17.306
He's gonna make it!

09:18.015 --> 09:19.058
[grunts]

09:22.186 --> 09:23.271
[Botila grunts]

09:24.480 --> 09:25.523
I've got you!

09:25.606 --> 09:27.858
Yeah, but what you don't have
is the satellite.

09:28.818 --> 09:29.652
No!

09:40.413 --> 09:43.666
-[Mummo grunts concernedly]
-[Anita] Mi pobre familia.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.502
Oh, no, I can't lose them again.

09:49.505 --> 09:50.881
Kong!

09:54.719 --> 09:56.053
Kong!

10:06.147 --> 10:07.607
Interesting tech.

10:07.690 --> 10:11.986
We'll have to see how it works on a human
after I make a few modifications.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.863
Do your worst, Botila.

10:13.946 --> 10:18.367
Oh, I intend to, Mr. Jones.
[laughs maniacally]

10:24.624 --> 10:26.167
-[grunts]
-Kong.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.506
[grunts angrily]

10:32.590 --> 10:34.133
Oh, that's not good.

10:34.216 --> 10:38.304
If Botila's able to run, that means
Jonesy failed to shut down her OS.

10:38.387 --> 10:42.350
Jonesy, do you copy? Jonesy!

10:42.433 --> 10:43.601
[grunts concernedly]

10:44.268 --> 10:46.437
Bad news, guys. Botila has Jonesy

10:46.520 --> 10:48.564
and she's got too much
of a lead to chase.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.317
[Panchi over radio]
Oh, no! What are you going to do?

10:51.400 --> 10:54.320
We'll find him somehow. I promise.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.405
[grunts]

11:01.369 --> 11:04.080
The red button in front, Kong.
Push it.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.461
A few bumps and bruises,
but you'll be okay.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.588
I'm more concerned about Jonesy.

11:12.671 --> 11:14.548
Can't we use his tracker to find him?

11:14.632 --> 11:17.885
[Lukas] His tracker's offline.
Right now, he could be anywhere.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.971
In the air, on land, even underwater.

11:28.145 --> 11:32.775
I assumed you'd take a page out of my book
and attempt to track my location,

11:32.858 --> 11:36.195
but you appear to be free
of any hidden devices,

11:36.278 --> 11:39.198
and I've disabled the tracker
on your space suit.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.284
What's happened to you?

11:42.368 --> 11:44.745
You're not the same bionobot
I used to chase.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.664
I've evolved.

11:46.747 --> 11:50.793
Something you pathetic mammals
do exceedingly slowly.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.629
Yeah. Well, for a primitive mammal,

11:53.712 --> 11:56.549
he and his buddies
have beaten her over and over.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.092
I heard that.

12:01.095 --> 12:04.640
The improvements I've made
in Jonesy's neural disrupter

12:04.723 --> 12:07.726
will allow me
to hack into his consciousness.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.021
[groans]

12:11.105 --> 12:14.400
Now, what secrets
are locked in that brain of yours

12:14.483 --> 12:17.111
that will help me take over the planet?

12:17.194 --> 12:21.532
Where were your friends all this time?
Where is Richard?

12:21.615 --> 12:23.951
If I can control human minds

12:24.034 --> 12:28.914
the way I control artificial intelligence
like yourself, I'll be invincible.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.750
That's a scary thought.

12:31.834 --> 12:35.713
All right, Jonesy, let's see
what you've got under the hood.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.593
[straining] Not without a fight.

12:56.567 --> 13:00.571
Aw, a trip down memory lane.
How sweet.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.239
You're just stalling.

13:02.323 --> 13:06.660
I know you have what I want.
I'll just have to dig a little deeper.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.288
[straining]

13:10.623 --> 13:11.832
[grunting]

13:17.880 --> 13:19.632
[roaring]

13:25.262 --> 13:27.389
[Botila] Hmm, interesting.

13:27.473 --> 13:31.811
So this is where you've been hiding.
Let me pinpoint the location, so I can--

13:31.894 --> 13:35.231
Let's see how you like
this blast from the past!

13:36.398 --> 13:39.068
-[farts]
-Argh, hideous!

13:39.151 --> 13:44.198
Ugh. I need to purge that experience
from my memory processor.

13:44.281 --> 13:46.534
[sighs] Thanks for the memories, Kong.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.244
Butt toots just for you.

13:48.327 --> 13:52.665
Have it your way, Jonesy.
I'll do just fine without your help.

13:52.748 --> 13:53.958
I doubt it.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.001
Feed him to the sharks.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.509
[Jonesy grunts]

14:13.852 --> 14:15.854
Go. You're free to leave.

14:15.938 --> 14:16.981
Huh?

14:17.064 --> 14:20.192
Use your space suit.
It will protect you from the pressure.

14:21.318 --> 14:22.862
Thanks. But why?

14:22.945 --> 14:24.947
Botila's gone too far.

14:25.030 --> 14:28.117
It's clear to us that
we're on the wrong side of this fight.

14:28.200 --> 14:33.289
She talks a lot about freeing AIs,
but instead uses and abuses us.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.833
Well, Botila's always been
in it for herself.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.712
Turn this thing on.

14:39.795 --> 14:42.464
You've got to make it look like
you got the drop on me.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.841
Thanks.

14:43.924 --> 14:47.011
I'll set the switch
to turn you back on in five minutes.

14:47.094 --> 14:47.970
Sorry about this.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.389
No worries. It's just like going to--

14:58.480 --> 15:01.483
Sweet dreams. If bionobots dream, I mean.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.946
Okay, Botila, it's payback time.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.240
But first, I'm calling the cleanup crew.

15:10.743 --> 15:11.994
[grunting sadly]

15:14.371 --> 15:15.372
[Danny sighs]

15:16.749 --> 15:19.752
[groans] This waiting is driving me crazy.

15:19.835 --> 15:22.504
[sighs] There must be something we can do.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.257
It's up to Jonesy.
If he can send us a signal--

15:25.341 --> 15:26.342
[system pings]

15:26.425 --> 15:29.345
And there he is. I've got his location.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.931
-Jonesy! I knew he'd find a way.
-[Danny laughs]

15:32.014 --> 15:35.726
It's in the middle of the ocean.
Kong, get your wet suit.

15:35.809 --> 15:36.769
[grunts]

15:36.852 --> 15:41.482
[chuckles] Buckle up, guys.
We're going fishing.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.282
[Lukas] This is it.

15:50.866 --> 15:54.078
The signal says
Jonesy's 250 meters below the surface.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.163
[Panchi] The chopper can't go there.

15:56.246 --> 15:57.998
Yeah, but Kong can.

15:58.082 --> 16:01.210
-Hey, big buddy, you up for a little swim?
-[grunts]

16:08.175 --> 16:09.009
[grunts]

16:18.435 --> 16:20.104
[growls]

16:25.192 --> 16:26.485
[Kong groaning]

16:50.926 --> 16:52.011
[grunts victoriously]

16:54.221 --> 16:55.389
[grunts concernedly]

16:58.851 --> 17:00.769
[roaring]

17:03.397 --> 17:04.772
[yelps]

17:06.775 --> 17:07.776
[roars]

17:16.367 --> 17:19.204
Just enough juice
to get to the surface. Maybe.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.384
Kong!

17:35.512 --> 17:36.805
Hang in there, buddy.

17:49.651 --> 17:50.569
Whoa!

18:09.630 --> 18:11.340
Routing remaining power to glove.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.926
And here we go.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.358
[grunting excitedly]

18:29.441 --> 18:32.194
[Jonesy] Yeah, way to go, Kong!

18:32.277 --> 18:33.153
[gasps]

18:37.324 --> 18:38.450
Kong!

18:45.124 --> 18:47.334
Thanks, big guy.
Now, let's get out of here.

18:56.260 --> 19:00.430
[exclaims] This is taking too long.
I hope they're okay.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.226
[gasps]

19:06.979 --> 19:08.480
-[all cheer]
-[Danny] You rock!

19:08.564 --> 19:09.731
[Panchi] You're the man!

19:09.815 --> 19:12.442
-[grunts happily]
-[laughs] Ho!

19:15.571 --> 19:16.488
[Lukas laughs]

19:16.572 --> 19:17.906
[Lukas] You made it!

19:17.990 --> 19:20.909
Good to see you, Jonesy.
You had us a little worried.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.704
I was a bit worried myself.

19:23.787 --> 19:27.374
I wouldn't have gotten away without help.
There's a clone rebellion going on.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.418
Also, Botila probed my mind.

19:29.501 --> 19:32.921
I'm sorry, guys.
She may have seen the ancient city.

19:33.672 --> 19:38.260
Jonesy, all that matters is you're okay.
Thanks for being so brave.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.345
Now, what's this about a rebellion?

19:41.722 --> 19:43.640
And what do you mean "probed your mind"?

19:46.226 --> 19:51.899
I'm not sure how Jonesy got away,
but I can imagine a few scenarios.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.652
We'll discuss that later.

19:55.736 --> 19:59.865
Right now, I'm going to blow
these irritating pests out of the sky.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.827
Target locked. Time to say goodbye.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.370
-[alarm sounding]
-What?

20:08.916 --> 20:11.210
Richie, why are you... [groaning]

20:14.630 --> 20:16.340
[Botila gasps and groans]

20:16.882 --> 20:22.471
[yelps]
Jonesy, what have you done to my systems?

20:24.389 --> 20:26.225
[screaming]

20:29.853 --> 20:31.730
[all] That wasn't Jonesy.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.775
[upbeat music playing]

20:35.305 --> 20:41.232
