00:23.959 --> 00:28.292
As the number of defectors rise each year,

00:28.292 --> 00:31.042
the total number has reached 20,000.

00:31.501 --> 00:33.459
It was a living hell...

00:37.876 --> 00:40.626
Showbox/Mediaplex Presents

00:51.917 --> 00:54.542
A Greenfish and Showbox/Mediaplex Production

01:09.834 --> 01:11.584
Directed by WON Shin-yun

02:04.709 --> 02:06.792
Please don't kill me...

02:07.334 --> 02:09.417
Please don't kill me!

02:40.209 --> 02:42.709
The dryer is all wet.

02:43.001 --> 02:44.834
It won't last very long.

02:45.334 --> 02:48.917
I never got a chance to tell you last time,

02:48.917 --> 02:51.917
when the doc airs, people'll donate,

02:51.917 --> 02:53.001
even supplies...

02:56.834 --> 02:59.001
All the bullshit will catch up to you.

02:59.917 --> 03:02.084
Come on, out of the rain!

03:03.626 --> 03:06.709
One should be honest, you hear me?

03:07.001 --> 03:08.209
Shut your hole,

03:09.001 --> 03:11.459
and go shoot some nice rain inserts.

03:12.209 --> 03:13.584
I'm a reporter.

03:13.626 --> 03:15.334
Why am I doing this for?

03:15.334 --> 03:17.417
I even smuggled out equipment.

03:17.417 --> 03:19.542
And where's my exclusive?

03:19.542 --> 03:21.084
"Do this, do that..."

03:21.417 --> 03:22.751
It's been 3 months!

03:40.209 --> 03:41.542
Lee Gwang-jo, Seoul Lee Gwang-jo, Gyunggi

04:16.291 --> 04:17.209
Yo, this is all I got.

04:18.209 --> 04:19.416
Take it or leave it!

04:33.126 --> 04:33.876
Yes.

04:46.251 --> 04:47.126
You're here?

04:51.709 --> 04:55.917
Hyejoo Group's Chairman Park,
Visiting Pyongyang Tomorrow

05:05.376 --> 05:07.667
Your resignation is not finalized.

05:08.626 --> 05:11.209
Won't you come back to work?

05:12.042 --> 05:13.667
Thank you for looking after me.

05:14.626 --> 05:15.626
But I really must decline.

05:16.084 --> 05:18.709
Still not a real Southerner yet.

05:19.626 --> 05:22.417
Ain't easy to stand on your own
in this country.

05:24.084 --> 05:27.084
I got plenty of work, and it's quite fun.

05:27.417 --> 05:28.542
Fun?

05:29.459 --> 05:31.126
As a hired driver?

05:31.626 --> 05:35.209
Mr. Chairman, he might choke.

05:35.292 --> 05:37.626
How about letting him finish his meal first?

05:38.917 --> 05:41.834
I know exactly what you're doing
on your free time.

05:42.917 --> 05:45.417
Drop this nonsense and come back!

06:02.417 --> 06:08.042
Southerners think buckwheats grow well here.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.834
They're all wrong.

06:11.209 --> 06:13.084
It's much better in the North.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.251
Did you eat a lot of buckwheat rice?

06:22.126 --> 06:28.667
Oh well... You fled the damn place,
no point of reminiscing.

06:29.667 --> 06:31.042
Forgive me.

06:36.167 --> 06:37.709
I ate enough to last a lifetime.

06:39.001 --> 06:40.542
Made noodles,

06:40.876 --> 06:42.626
and side dishes.

06:44.209 --> 06:45.959
That's right.

06:47.167 --> 06:50.626
It's an amazing thing, it grows so well.

06:51.251 --> 06:56.001
Even without much sun and proper soil too.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.376
During the march, we didn't even have that...

07:02.501 --> 07:05.542
Yeah, it'll be okay now.

07:06.709 --> 07:08.584
Everything will be fine.

07:25.001 --> 07:27.917
The reason why the chairman looked after you...

07:28.792 --> 07:31.917
isn't only because you're from his hometown.

07:33.834 --> 07:38.876
You remind him of a son he left behind.

07:41.876 --> 07:43.209
It's his parting gift.

07:49.167 --> 07:53.001
Central district, Samik Mansion #308,
Lee Gwang-jo

07:53.084 --> 07:56.792
He knew you were looking for this person.

07:57.501 --> 07:59.292
He hesitated for a while...

07:59.709 --> 08:04.834
If you find him,
he hopes that you'll forgive him.

08:07.417 --> 08:08.459
And...

08:09.084 --> 08:10.167
your severance.

08:37.376 --> 08:39.876
Over the Wall, Towards Unification

09:37.542 --> 09:39.792
Who the fuck is that?

10:42.376 --> 10:43.542
Please...

10:45.001 --> 10:46.542
bury... this...

10:47.001 --> 10:48.292
Please...

11:10.542 --> 11:11.834
An outgoing call to the police.

11:13.042 --> 11:14.292
Should I intercept?

11:21.001 --> 11:22.334
Are you two the only ones here?

11:23.042 --> 11:25.876
Yes, at night we're the only ones.

11:28.459 --> 11:30.292
Who's that?

11:30.417 --> 11:33.001
That's Ji Dong-chul, he's a defector.

11:33.834 --> 11:37.001
The chairman was very fond of him.

11:46.751 --> 11:48.917
Sir, could I take a look at that?

11:51.459 --> 11:52.334
Let me see that.

11:53.376 --> 11:55.084
Why do you want this?

11:56.542 --> 11:58.417
Personal items of the victim...

12:10.959 --> 12:11.667
What happened?!

12:12.209 --> 12:13.834
He fled, we're searching.

12:18.126 --> 12:20.917
He's hiding here somewhere. Give us some time.

12:21.376 --> 12:23.001
Call it off, you idiot.

12:23.667 --> 12:25.376
Wanna wake the entire town?

12:26.126 --> 12:27.917
He won't be easily captured.

12:59.417 --> 13:02.626
Agent Kim, NSIA,
get me Defense Security Command.

13:06.167 --> 13:07.584
Do you have someone you love?

13:08.334 --> 13:09.667
Yes, sir!

13:09.667 --> 13:12.334
I can't hear you! Do you miss them?!

13:12.334 --> 13:14.209
Yes, sir!

13:17.459 --> 13:18.626
This is it.

13:19.751 --> 13:21.751
Call out her name and let's go to hell.

13:22.334 --> 13:23.001
Execute.

13:23.167 --> 13:27.126
- Mother! - Ji-eun!

13:38.626 --> 13:39.501
Let's

13:47.584 --> 13:49.584
Pyongyang is out there! Go!

14:05.709 --> 14:06.667
No drop! No drop!

14:26.334 --> 14:27.417
You can't!

14:29.334 --> 14:33.709
Sergeant will fall to his death!

14:34.084 --> 14:35.209
Then will you die for him?

14:48.501 --> 14:49.042
Colonel!

14:49.584 --> 14:50.792
Colonel!

16:05.501 --> 16:08.626
Go rescue your lover!

16:08.834 --> 16:10.376
Wake up!

16:11.251 --> 16:13.667
We're on the ground, asshole.

16:27.417 --> 16:28.417
Salute!

16:31.792 --> 16:33.709
Colonel Min! You have an emergency call!

16:34.667 --> 16:35.584
From whom?!

16:36.292 --> 16:38.376
No one dares to disrupt
the last week of boot camp.

16:38.709 --> 16:41.292
I was instructed to bring you in,
there's a target for you.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.334
Dammit...

16:43.001 --> 16:44.501
Who's the lucky SOB?

16:45.792 --> 16:47.376
His name is Ji Dong-chul.

16:54.001 --> 16:55.542
What did you say?

17:10.666 --> 17:11.709
That's nonsense!

17:12.834 --> 17:14.041
We helped them so much...

17:15.041 --> 17:15.709
Why would...

17:16.709 --> 17:17.959
the North do this?

17:17.959 --> 17:21.584
Don't expect a thank you card.
It's a complicated relations.

17:22.626 --> 17:23.709
I'll go and ask myself!

17:24.626 --> 17:27.041
You're free to do so, but on your return...

17:30.376 --> 17:32.084
you'll be arrested under National Security Law.

17:34.501 --> 17:35.709
Is that a threat?

17:40.876 --> 17:41.626
Yes.

17:55.251 --> 17:56.126
Dong-chul!

17:56.876 --> 17:58.417
The chairman was assassinated.

17:59.084 --> 18:00.292
Yes, I know.

18:01.001 --> 18:03.292
Where are you now?

18:06.501 --> 18:07.501
Please just listen.

18:09.542 --> 18:11.001
He left me something.

18:11.751 --> 18:14.334
He asked me to bury it,
but I have to do something first.

18:14.834 --> 18:16.834
Okay, where are you?

18:32.876 --> 18:35.167
Sir, where does the defector live?

19:19.084 --> 19:21.417
He's not answering again. You try it.

19:23.292 --> 19:26.542
If boss finds out what I'm doing here,
he'll pat me in the back.

19:31.709 --> 19:34.417
I friggin' dare you to ignore me...

19:36.126 --> 19:36.876
Drive.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.542
Unofficially,

19:45.876 --> 19:50.209
at 9 a.m., in order to apprehend the suspect,

19:50.334 --> 19:54.501
National Intelligence Service and DSC
began coordinating a joint op.

19:54.751 --> 19:58.417
The central command of this op
is NSIA HQ situation room 2,

19:58.417 --> 20:02.751
and NSIA is heading up the task force.

20:03.834 --> 20:08.209
As you know, Park was deeply involved
in the North-South relations,

20:08.376 --> 20:12.876
and he was scheduled to visit Pyongyang today.

20:13.917 --> 20:19.001
The suspect is an ex-ops defector,
who was under special care.

20:19.209 --> 20:23.042
You may have already realized
the gravity of this situation.

20:23.042 --> 20:24.376
We hear you loud and clear.

20:25.126 --> 20:27.126
So, who'll lead the search?

20:35.334 --> 20:36.334
Let me introduce you,

20:36.584 --> 20:39.792
the best counter-espionage officer,
Colonel Min Se-hun.

20:43.167 --> 20:46.959
The series is called
'Give Hope to the Defectors'.

20:47.167 --> 20:49.667
It's got a good audience base for a cable show.

20:49.959 --> 20:52.292
The donation is considerable.

20:53.167 --> 20:56.167
- Especially if your story is...
- What the heck?

20:57.501 --> 20:59.792
Holy shit! Park Gun-ho is dead!

21:00.376 --> 21:01.667
Hyejoo Group's chairman Park?

21:01.834 --> 21:03.292
You interviewed him recently!

21:03.292 --> 21:04.792
BREAKING NEWS: Homicide Ruled Out

21:04.792 --> 21:07.959
Despite ruling out possibility of homicide,

21:08.126 --> 21:10.876
the police refuse to comment about
the deaths of his housekeepers.

21:10.876 --> 21:14.251
Pyongyang Visit Cancelled

21:14.251 --> 21:16.292
- Oh yeah. - What?

21:16.417 --> 21:17.709
Didn't you visit the chairman...

21:29.292 --> 21:31.501
Why didn't you tell me about Ji's defection?

21:33.084 --> 21:36.001
You two aren't best buds,
didn't think it was necessary.

21:36.917 --> 21:39.542
Drop the sentimentality.
Who's the head on this?

21:41.042 --> 21:42.084
The President.

21:43.584 --> 21:45.459
He killed the housekeepers too?

21:46.001 --> 21:47.251
Two shots to the temple each.

21:47.376 --> 21:48.751
If it was him,

21:49.334 --> 21:51.709
it'd have been easy to fake it
as a natural cause.

21:54.459 --> 21:55.917
Leave that to the investigators.

21:55.917 --> 21:58.251
Your job is to find Ji Dong-chul, that's it.

21:59.126 --> 22:00.501
In need of a hunting dog?

22:01.334 --> 22:03.334
No need for dramatics.

22:03.584 --> 22:04.459
It's not?

22:05.167 --> 22:07.626
A dog that won't bark
but still gets the job done.

22:10.292 --> 22:11.584
This is for our nation.

22:12.126 --> 22:14.584
You're the best spy sniffer around.

22:39.084 --> 22:39.751
Salute!

22:43.376 --> 22:44.334
Conniving SOB...

22:46.917 --> 22:48.042
What the hell is that?

22:48.584 --> 22:50.834
Coming out of the closet?

22:50.834 --> 22:53.084
Well, it's, um...The chute wire scar...

22:53.084 --> 22:55.167
ls that gum or your lunch?

23:00.042 --> 23:01.334
I got him as your deputy.

23:01.834 --> 23:04.834
He did well in the counter-espionage TF.

23:05.917 --> 23:08.167
He's got plenty of data
on Ji Dong-chul as well.

23:08.459 --> 23:09.209
Fucking SPY-

23:10.792 --> 23:12.626
Plenty of data?

23:13.876 --> 23:15.292
Come on, colonel...

23:15.292 --> 23:18.209
You know I was assigned to that detail.

23:20.334 --> 23:20.792
Full attention!

23:25.334 --> 23:26.917
Let me introduce you to...

23:29.376 --> 23:31.334
Who has heard of Ryonggang Base?

23:32.334 --> 23:33.751
Ryonggang is...

23:34.376 --> 23:36.667
a small village to the west of Pyongyang.

23:37.501 --> 23:39.792
A military training facility is located there.

23:40.209 --> 23:44.417
About 10 officers are on deck
to train just 1 soldier.

23:44.876 --> 23:48.584
Only the best soldiers from various
special forces are accepted,

23:48.626 --> 23:53.667
most trainees get injured or die.
It's affectionately called 'Hell'.

23:57.709 --> 24:00.042
Less than 3% of the trainees
complete the program.

24:19.542 --> 24:24.001
Once they complete it,
they're dispersed all over the world.

24:24.334 --> 24:26.751
Interpol claimed that since mid-2000s,

24:26.917 --> 24:29.876
arms dealers from China, Kosovo,
Montenegro, among others,

24:30.209 --> 24:33.292
were kidnapped and killed by these spies,

24:33.334 --> 24:37.584
but didn't have any evidences
to back up their claims.

24:49.001 --> 24:51.626
$30 million in $100 bills.

24:57.709 --> 24:59.126
They're clean.

25:00.042 --> 25:01.292
Let's see those hands, motherfucker!

25:01.542 --> 25:02.792
You heard him asshole, get those hands up!

25:03.667 --> 25:06.167
I've spent last <i>2</i> Christmases away
from my family chasing you, motherfucker!

25:49.209 --> 25:53.001
Then in 2009, there was an incident
in Hong Kong.

25:59.417 --> 26:03.876
Our agents were dispatched to intercept
a deal by the North...

26:04.959 --> 26:08.001
But the intel was a decoy tactic,

26:09.834 --> 26:13.001
and weapons were sold to the Philippines
on another ship.

26:19.209 --> 26:19.876
On that mission,

26:22.501 --> 26:26.626
one of our agents was killed,
and 5 were critically injured.

26:54.084 --> 26:55.251
Not long after that,

26:55.251 --> 26:58.209
the same NK operator defected.

26:59.626 --> 27:03.917
And he verified everything
that I just told you.

27:04.542 --> 27:07.251
Yup, that's our target,

27:08.792 --> 27:09.542
Ji Dong-chul.

27:17.376 --> 27:20.834
Park was to visit North Korea today,
is this related?

27:22.417 --> 27:25.084
Why is National Security Intelligence
Agency involved?

27:38.584 --> 27:40.917
We start by creating a dragnet around him.

27:41.667 --> 27:44.959
Prioritize his recent calls and contact them,

27:45.042 --> 27:46.959
report anything we can use.

27:47.292 --> 27:50.084
He was a hired driver,
so focus on any repeated numbers.

27:51.042 --> 27:54.167
Contact his banks and flag his known accounts.

27:54.334 --> 27:58.417
Colleagues, creditors, fellow defectors,
call everyone.

28:02.792 --> 28:04.667
A gun was recovered at his home.

28:05.126 --> 28:06.709
It's likely the murder weapon.

28:11.001 --> 28:12.542
POV cam online.

28:12.542 --> 28:14.126
Patching the feed to the HQ.

28:17.042 --> 28:18.417
German-made Walther P99.

28:18.959 --> 28:21.584
- We got him now. - Lift fingerprints.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.709
Analyze the bullet with the one
recovered from Park's body.

28:26.001 --> 28:27.834
One bullet in the mag.

28:33.334 --> 28:34.251
What the heck?

28:34.251 --> 28:36.292
Lee Gwang-jo

28:36.667 --> 28:39.084
There is a list behind the map.

28:41.126 --> 28:42.126
Lee Gwang-Jo?

28:43.001 --> 28:44.417
Another target maybe?

28:44.876 --> 28:45.626
Look into it.

28:46.209 --> 28:48.042
Find out who and where he is.

28:48.959 --> 28:50.876
He made contact with someone an hour ago.

28:50.876 --> 28:51.709
Who?

28:51.709 --> 28:54.459
A documentary producer, and a cameraman.

28:54.876 --> 28:55.917
Bring them in!

28:55.917 --> 28:58.959
Dig their connections to Ji
and their recent location!

28:59.042 --> 29:00.084
Yes, sir.

29:10.751 --> 29:12.126
- Choi Kyung-hee? - Yes, sir.

29:12.584 --> 29:16.626
Fired as a reporter a year ago,
she produces documentaries now.

29:16.792 --> 29:19.501
- And the connection to Ji?
- She's working on a doc...

29:20.001 --> 29:20.834
about lives of defectors.

29:22.001 --> 29:25.334
But she has not produced anything,
so I dug further,

29:25.334 --> 29:27.834
and her studio doesn't exist,
it's just a front.

29:27.834 --> 29:28.542
No Hope for the Future

29:28.542 --> 29:29.209
Defector Suicide Rate 6.3%

29:37.001 --> 29:39.376
She looks prettier in person.

29:41.876 --> 29:43.001
Knock it off.

29:50.084 --> 29:53.709
Digging into defectors' lives
after getting fired...

30:00.626 --> 30:02.459
From fake proposal,

30:03.042 --> 30:05.001
to ghost company, what's the point?

30:05.542 --> 30:07.334
We know all about it, so fess up.

30:07.917 --> 30:09.709
Why are you after Ji?

30:10.042 --> 30:11.167
Wait...

30:11.501 --> 30:13.209
you searched the office?

30:14.251 --> 30:16.959
- You sons of bitches!
- Stop it!

30:16.959 --> 30:19.167
What's your name? Where do you belong to?

30:19.167 --> 30:20.584
Come on, will you stop that?

30:20.584 --> 30:22.584
Is harassing civilians part of your job?

30:22.667 --> 30:25.709
Don't you see what's going on?

30:26.167 --> 30:29.834
This is a murder case! Ji killed a man!

30:34.834 --> 30:37.626
Then... he found him?

30:38.167 --> 30:39.167
Found who?

30:39.751 --> 30:40.501
What?

30:42.376 --> 30:46.167
A man who claims to be Ji
just called the police dispatch.

30:48.084 --> 30:51.417
Isn't that...colonel Min?

30:51.417 --> 30:53.292
He was in your research file.

30:54.167 --> 30:56.584
He was pushed out by agent Kim
after the Hong Kong mission...

30:57.042 --> 30:58.001
The spy hunter!

30:58.251 --> 31:01.292
Shut up and play dumb. Don't dust up a storm.

31:01.459 --> 31:03.709
I'm scared shitless.

31:03.876 --> 31:06.751
I knew this was a mistake!

31:07.084 --> 31:08.501
Executive Breakdown Chart

31:08.501 --> 31:09.501
Chairman Park Gun-ho

31:09.501 --> 31:10.667
COO Song Sang-geun

31:13.709 --> 31:15.001
He popped UP-

31:15.667 --> 31:17.126
In eastern Seoul.

31:19.542 --> 31:20.417
Who's nearby?

31:20.709 --> 31:22.917
An operator and a handler.

31:24.126 --> 31:26.667
Secure the glasses and kill him.

31:27.917 --> 31:28.959
Do it clean.

31:28.959 --> 31:33.251
The thing is, the handler's name
popped up in Ji's room.

31:33.501 --> 31:36.334
Looks like Ji was looking for him
for some time now.

31:36.626 --> 31:37.751
Who's the handler?

31:38.376 --> 31:41.917
Lee Gwang-jo, also from Ryonggang,

31:42.417 --> 31:44.376
he's with the Order now.

31:44.376 --> 31:45.542
Lee Gwang-jo...

31:46.584 --> 31:48.459
Oh, him!

31:50.292 --> 31:53.126
This is good. We got a proper bait now.

32:16.209 --> 32:17.917
Are you in charge of the chairman Park case?

32:18.459 --> 32:20.042
Been a while, Ji Dong-chul.

32:20.917 --> 32:21.792
Who is this?

32:22.334 --> 32:24.167
Already forgot about me?

32:40.042 --> 32:41.584
Hands up and turn around.

32:45.792 --> 32:48.376
Since it's quiet, you must be alone.

33:00.251 --> 33:03.001
Colonel! Please help!

33:07.501 --> 33:08.751
Walk to the edge.

33:15.251 --> 33:16.959
Defense Security Command Colonel S. H. Min

33:17.292 --> 33:18.334
Shoot me.

33:20.209 --> 33:22.334
Or I will kill you.

33:53.001 --> 33:54.042
Buddy“.

33:54.834 --> 33:56.542
They abandoned you.

33:58.292 --> 34:03.042
Don't you see? They gave you up.

34:43.833 --> 34:45.542
Thanks to you, my life took a bad turn.

34:46.167 --> 34:48.001
Now I'm reduced to...

34:48.417 --> 34:49.833
a glorified drill sergeant.

34:50.251 --> 34:51.542
It's none of my business.

34:51.542 --> 34:54.501
Sure, we can settle this in person later.

34:56.958 --> 34:57.917
Central district.

34:58.542 --> 35:00.917
- Why did you kill him? - I'm innocent.

35:01.459 --> 35:03.167
I did not kill the chairman.

35:04.584 --> 35:06.167
So don't come after me.

35:06.667 --> 35:08.126
Sorry, my bad then.

35:08.292 --> 35:09.542
Someone else was there.

35:10.501 --> 35:12.709
- Holding a syringe.
- Expect me to believe that?

35:13.459 --> 35:16.042
They killed the chairman
and tried to take his glasses.

35:16.751 --> 35:17.751
Glasses?

35:18.376 --> 35:20.917
If you give me some time, I'll die quietly.

35:20.959 --> 35:25.584
No, I'll find you, and I will kill you.

35:29.417 --> 35:31.459
Samik Mansion in central district.

35:32.334 --> 35:33.959
You'll find my body there.

35:37.584 --> 35:39.959
Tact teams are 5 minutes out.

35:40.834 --> 35:42.751
Who else was there? What's this about glasses?

35:43.292 --> 35:45.459
Well...I'm not sure...

35:45.542 --> 35:46.751
You have to stop him!

35:48.709 --> 35:50.709
Why are they still here?!

35:50.709 --> 35:52.292
He's on a suicide mission!

35:53.209 --> 35:57.167
You can't be any more wrong!
He's after someone else!

35:57.376 --> 35:59.709
The one who killed his wife and daughter!

35:59.959 --> 36:02.084
He'll kill him and kill himself!

36:02.126 --> 36:04.334
- Out! Now! - Let me go!

36:50.001 --> 36:52.834
Lee Gwang-jo, your gun is right here.

37:05.667 --> 37:09.251
A hired gun for an agency?

37:11.751 --> 37:14.626
I gotta make a living, whatever it takes.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.042
You changed your name.

37:17.042 --> 37:19.167
National ID: Lee Young-jo

37:19.167 --> 37:20.667
Goes with switching sides.

37:22.584 --> 37:26.292
Fucker...Took me a long time...

37:26.709 --> 37:27.876
How did you find me?

37:29.001 --> 37:31.959
A little bird told me...as a gift.

37:42.126 --> 37:43.376
Speak.

37:45.459 --> 37:48.917
Tell me her last words, her dying words.

37:51.167 --> 37:52.584
Your wife?

37:57.542 --> 37:58.584
She begged for her life.

38:03.334 --> 38:04.251
And?

38:05.334 --> 38:07.042
That you'll find me...

38:11.251 --> 38:12.751
and kill me.

38:19.917 --> 38:21.167
Any last words?

38:51.209 --> 38:52.917
It's Park's real gift to you.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.001
Come and see.

39:02.334 --> 39:03.459
Should I come to you?

40:04.501 --> 40:06.292
Cover the exits and up the stairs!

40:17.251 --> 40:19.584
- Report! - There was a shootout.

40:19.626 --> 40:20.959
He fled the scene.

40:29.126 --> 40:30.042
Support team is approaching.

40:34.584 --> 40:35.584
Support is on-site.

40:41.667 --> 40:43.209
Where did he go?

40:52.584 --> 40:53.542
Check over there!

40:58.042 --> 41:00.917
Patch me to exit 4 cam.

41:09.376 --> 41:10.417
Exit 4 cam coming online.

41:11.376 --> 41:12.792
The fuck's right there.

41:18.667 --> 41:20.459
Pull up the 1st floor mall feed.

41:20.459 --> 41:22.417
Zoom in on the escalators.

41:22.417 --> 41:24.667
- Connecting to interior cams.
- Region 1 online.

41:24.667 --> 41:25.584
Region <i>2</i> online.

41:25.667 --> 41:27.126
Regions 3, 4, 5 online.

41:27.626 --> 41:29.459
Target spotted at D Mall!

41:30.167 --> 41:32.042
Moving to west end on the 1st floor!

41:32.042 --> 41:35.334
Mark him and sync with other CCTV feeds.

41:35.501 --> 41:37.334
- Marking.
- Syncing in progress.

41:37.876 --> 41:39.042
Ready.

41:44.292 --> 41:45.959
If we lose him, it's all over.

41:47.209 --> 41:48.792
On the escalator to the 2nd floor.

41:48.876 --> 41:52.251
Unit B to the east stairs
and unit A to the escalator.

41:57.792 --> 42:00.959
A and B maintain position,
unit C cover the exits.

42:14.626 --> 42:16.751
He's moving to the 3rd floor! Move your ass!

42:17.251 --> 42:17.959
On the move.

42:18.251 --> 42:19.751
3rd floor! Go!

42:25.417 --> 42:26.626
The hell's he doing?

42:27.584 --> 42:28.709
He's not trying to lose us.

42:29.542 --> 42:31.001
It's like he's chasing someone.

42:47.959 --> 42:50.501
I got visual, umbrella shop!

42:58.001 --> 42:58.959
Where did he go?

43:01.001 --> 43:03.084
Zooming in on the umbrella shop.

43:05.084 --> 43:06.792
Lost visual, we lost him.

43:07.834 --> 43:09.834
- No visual at regions <i>2</i> and 3.
- Check CCTV feeds!

43:10.126 --> 43:12.834
- Scanning nearby feeds.
- System okay.

43:13.376 --> 43:15.001
Elevator, the central elevator!

43:15.751 --> 43:17.334
He may've switched jackets.

43:17.751 --> 43:18.584
Exits covered?

43:32.834 --> 43:34.751
C maintain position,
A and B get to the basement!

43:34.751 --> 43:35.584
Move!

43:41.126 --> 43:41.917
Lee Gwang-jo.

43:43.292 --> 43:45.751
Lee Gwangi-jo, where are you?

45:23.001 --> 45:24.334
Who the hell is that?

45:24.334 --> 45:26.251
- He looks like one of ours.
- What?

45:26.251 --> 45:27.876
He has the same tech.

45:58.542 --> 45:59.667
I'm innocent.

46:00.209 --> 46:01.751
I did not kill the chairman.

46:02.376 --> 46:03.834
So don't come after me.

46:05.334 --> 46:07.501
- Sorry, my bad then.
- Someone else was there.

46:08.417 --> 46:10.792
- Holding a syringe.
- Expect me to believe that?

46:10.876 --> 46:13.376
They killed the chairman
and tried to take his glasses.

46:13.584 --> 46:14.584
What am I missing?

46:15.834 --> 46:17.751
I don't have the clearance to tell you that.

46:19.626 --> 46:20.501
And the glasses?

46:22.584 --> 46:26.501
Like you, I'm following my orders, I'm sorry.

46:27.042 --> 46:29.834
There's no doubt Ji is the killer.

46:30.584 --> 46:34.417
He has intel vital to national security.

46:37.917 --> 46:40.751
You grew some balls over the years.

46:43.084 --> 46:46.792
I'm not the same guy who waxed your boots.

46:47.501 --> 46:48.417
I see that.

46:48.417 --> 46:52.417
We left the academy together,
but only you moved up.

46:53.167 --> 46:56.001
You brought me in for that?
To grease your ego?

47:05.751 --> 47:10.126
I know you're puppeteering skilled defectors.

47:11.667 --> 47:12.751
The Order, I mean.

47:16.001 --> 47:19.792
I don't care what you do,

47:21.001 --> 47:22.251
just don't get caught.

47:28.709 --> 47:29.834
Have a nice meal.

47:31.292 --> 47:35.209
Don't you want your old seat?
How long will you drill newbies?

47:38.542 --> 47:40.667
If you lose a battle, you gotta win one.

47:43.626 --> 47:45.167
Grow some balls.

48:00.334 --> 48:01.876
Whose side are you on?

48:01.959 --> 48:03.501
If you're not on his, then follow me.

48:04.042 --> 48:06.376
I'm still a soldier. I know where I stand.

48:06.584 --> 48:08.417
That bastard's playing both sides.

48:09.209 --> 48:10.709
We gotta do the same.

48:14.542 --> 48:16.626
The police officially declared the death
of chairman Park as homicide,

48:16.626 --> 48:20.626
and are in pursuit of the killer
and the motive.

48:21.376 --> 48:23.709
In addition to chairman Park,

48:23.709 --> 48:31.126
two elderly housekeepers were found dead
at the scene.

48:31.126 --> 48:38.001
According to a source,
Park was accompanied by a hired driver,

48:38.042 --> 48:41.959
who has become the primary suspect...

49:06.334 --> 49:10.834
Aside from two open wounds
from gunshots, it's clean.

49:12.792 --> 49:14.251
Can't you read my report?

49:16.876 --> 49:17.751
Have you compared the slugs?

49:18.084 --> 49:21.834
The one found in the gun
and the one recovered are the same!

49:22.376 --> 49:23.709
And fingerprints on the gun?

49:24.292 --> 49:26.917
Isn't it obvious? Ji's prints are all over it.

49:27.667 --> 49:31.292
My job's done once my report is out.

49:31.292 --> 49:34.126
You should learn to trust us.

49:36.251 --> 49:37.501
Now, listen carefully.

49:38.167 --> 49:41.084
Due to continuing suspicion, the case reopens.

49:41.459 --> 49:46.667
There is a trail of an outside party
on the pathologist's call log.

49:47.126 --> 49:50.626
But another autopsy is impossible,
since the cortege is underway.

49:52.792 --> 49:54.084
And...

49:55.376 --> 49:56.626
what'd the brass think of this?

49:58.292 --> 50:02.459
If there was a backdoor deal,
those who made the deal...

50:04.667 --> 50:06.292
would get nervous.

50:06.751 --> 50:10.417
- They'd need a scapegoat.
- What are you insinuating?

50:13.001 --> 50:15.459
Once you compromise, it's over.

50:31.584 --> 50:32.376
Sir, check this out.

50:32.709 --> 50:36.667
This is from Ms. Choi's office.
She took efforts to hide Ji's files.

50:38.209 --> 50:39.917
Defection Route Report?

50:39.959 --> 50:43.167
Yes, it's very thorough, and quite a read.

50:43.542 --> 50:44.667
And this.

50:45.751 --> 50:48.251
It's Lee Gwang-jo's top secret dossier.

50:49.417 --> 50:50.917
Look carefully.

50:51.542 --> 50:55.459
After the HK mission,
Ji went back home on his own.

50:55.834 --> 51:00.251
Like Choi said, he had a wife and a kid.

51:08.292 --> 51:13.792
Before Kim Jong-il's death,
he appointed Kim Jong-un as his successor.

51:14.126 --> 51:17.417
Any potential threats were eliminated.

51:18.709 --> 51:23.501
Ji gave his life to his country
but realized this all too late.

52:04.459 --> 52:08.042
Fucking traitor, who is this?

52:08.667 --> 52:10.917
Defector Met in China

52:34.292 --> 52:36.209
As soon as he found his family's whereabouts,

52:36.709 --> 52:39.792
he escaped the military prison camp.

53:11.542 --> 53:14.709
Remember the murder case
of pastor Kim Johan and his wife?

53:16.042 --> 53:17.667
He worked as a broker for defectors.

53:17.667 --> 53:18.667
Pastor Kim Johan Murdered in China

53:18.917 --> 53:20.667
- Ji was there? - Yes.

53:20.917 --> 53:22.001
But a step too late.

53:25.667 --> 53:27.334
- Lee Gwang-jo? - Right.

53:27.959 --> 53:31.376
Also trained at Ryonggang,
Lee carried out the hit.

53:32.167 --> 53:35.751
And Ji's wife and child were there.

54:01.917 --> 54:04.459
What the fuck are you waiting for?!

54:10.459 --> 54:13.626
Please don't kill me...

54:25.084 --> 54:27.917
Soon afterwards, Lee defects to the South.

54:29.709 --> 54:31.042
Psychological trauma...

54:31.042 --> 54:33.292
The guilt was probably too much.

54:33.917 --> 54:37.459
Ji was a close comrade and she recognized him.

54:38.001 --> 54:41.459
- Then Ji was after... - Choi was right.

54:43.042 --> 54:44.209
To kill Lee.

54:45.667 --> 54:50.084
So he was chasing...Lee at the mall.

56:02.834 --> 56:04.167
Daughter

56:07.209 --> 56:10.584
is alive

56:19.334 --> 56:22.084
Ji was with chairman Park prior to his death,

56:22.667 --> 56:26.501
and his whereabouts were unknown
until yesterday...

56:26.501 --> 56:30.584
What do you think of him
as the case's primary suspect?

56:30.584 --> 56:32.001
It's utter nonsense.

56:32.001 --> 56:33.917
Any reason for your statement?

56:33.917 --> 56:35.709
He'd never do this.

56:49.584 --> 56:50.501
It's Ji Dong-chul!

56:52.501 --> 56:54.084
Aren't you supposed to be dead?

56:54.126 --> 56:56.001
I'll give you the glasses in exchange for Lee.

56:56.001 --> 56:57.959
Asshole, I don't negotiate!

56:58.251 --> 57:01.876
- I give a fuck about the glasses.
- Your boss too?

57:03.376 --> 57:04.501
Are you fucking with me?

57:04.501 --> 57:06.709
I will go to the media with this secret soon.

57:06.709 --> 57:09.751
Find Lee before then.

57:30.959 --> 57:33.251
No, no, no. High quality.

57:35.959 --> 57:37.126
It's confirmed.

57:37.917 --> 57:40.626
The resident of Samik is Lee.

57:45.542 --> 57:48.292
He changed his name to Lee Young-jo.

57:48.334 --> 57:51.042
He's also affiliated with the dead agent.

57:52.042 --> 57:54.376
- The Order? - Yes, that one.

57:54.584 --> 57:58.792
It's a private corporation headed by agent Kim,
it looks shady.

57:59.334 --> 58:02.459
Sniff around some more, and find Lee!

58:03.084 --> 58:03.834
Yes, sir.

58:04.667 --> 58:05.709
And this.

58:05.709 --> 58:06.876
Dongsung Production

58:06.876 --> 58:09.542
- Choi's file again?
- Take a closer look.

58:11.251 --> 58:13.876
She was dismissed due to external pressure.

58:15.501 --> 58:19.084
She wrote an exposé about corruption
within NSIA.

58:19.251 --> 58:20.376
This is pastor Kim?

58:20.626 --> 58:22.834
Found it while digging
into top secret NSIA files.

58:23.584 --> 58:24.667
Rather curious.

58:25.917 --> 58:31.667
So the source who leaked info
on Kim was the pastor?

58:31.959 --> 58:32.709
Right.

58:36.459 --> 58:43.667
So Kim released the location
of the pastor to the North.

58:43.876 --> 58:47.417
And Choi was digging into Kim, not Ji...

58:47.417 --> 58:49.459
Why did she go after Ji?

58:50.459 --> 58:52.251
Probably needed more evidence for her article.

58:52.709 --> 58:57.376
He's also a victim, and the Order
probably tried to recruit him.

58:57.709 --> 59:01.417
So Ji is both witness and evidence!

59:01.417 --> 59:03.542
Dongsung Production

59:13.959 --> 59:15.959
Mr. Vengeance

59:17.542 --> 59:19.167
Took forever to gather the data...

59:26.626 --> 59:27.792
Hello?

59:27.959 --> 59:28.751
It's Ji Dong-chul.

59:33.501 --> 59:34.917
I know you were a reporter.

59:35.792 --> 59:38.584
I got something to give you, can you help?

59:39.001 --> 59:40.167
Something for me?

59:53.209 --> 59:54.709
Have you found Lee yet?

59:54.709 --> 59:57.459
Dammit, it's not easy locating a former spy!

01:00:00.667 --> 01:00:02.126
Motherfucker!

01:00:03.292 --> 01:00:06.834
Hanging up on me?!

01:00:15.126 --> 01:00:16.834
Choi Kyung-hee is on the move.

01:00:17.292 --> 01:00:18.042
Where is she heading?

01:00:18.126 --> 01:00:19.751
West-bound, from sector C.

01:00:20.709 --> 01:00:22.667
Where are we on tracking Ji's phone?

01:00:23.084 --> 01:00:24.792
He's on Rivershore Express heading east.

01:00:28.251 --> 01:00:29.667
It's the opposite way.

01:00:29.667 --> 01:00:31.334
Did you put a tail on Choi?

01:00:31.709 --> 01:00:32.584
Of course.

01:00:34.001 --> 01:00:37.459
Send another team to where Ji is heading.

01:00:37.751 --> 01:00:39.001
Where are you going, sir?

01:00:39.501 --> 01:00:40.334
For a walk!

01:00:43.334 --> 01:00:44.542
Stay close to the mark.

01:00:48.042 --> 01:00:51.501
Ji is crossing the Hannam Bridge.
He's still on the phone.

01:00:52.084 --> 01:00:53.751
Clone Choi's cell phone and monitor it

01:00:55.459 --> 01:00:56.292
Sir...

01:00:56.751 --> 01:00:58.626
will you come across Ji while on your walk?

01:00:58.751 --> 01:00:59.959
Just find that rat, idiot!

01:01:17.792 --> 01:01:19.959
And the next stop is to the plastic surgeon.

01:01:19.959 --> 01:01:23.209
What His Highness Kim Jong-il
has not provided,

01:01:23.751 --> 01:01:26.084
plastic surgeon in Gangnam certainly will.

01:01:37.667 --> 01:01:39.251
The Order Agent SA2

01:01:43.792 --> 01:01:46.001
- Go buy me a pack of gum.
- What?

01:01:46.876 --> 01:01:47.876
Bubble gum.

01:01:49.959 --> 01:01:51.709
Don't forget the receipt.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:53.626
We got juniors...for that...

01:01:54.667 --> 01:01:55.417
Just go.

01:01:57.167 --> 01:01:58.459
Take your time.

01:02:14.292 --> 01:02:15.334
Where are you?

01:02:15.376 --> 01:02:16.834
I'm almost there.

01:02:17.959 --> 01:02:20.376
Orange cab, heading towards Gangnam station.

01:02:21.876 --> 01:02:22.626
Maintain distance.

01:02:30.209 --> 01:02:31.501
Is the source verified?

01:02:32.209 --> 01:02:34.751
Still on his cell phone,
probably a pre-paid phone.

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:36.292
We're moving in.

01:03:03.334 --> 01:03:04.542
What's going on?

01:03:04.709 --> 01:03:07.084
I only ran one light.

01:03:11.459 --> 01:03:12.251
Where are you?

01:03:12.251 --> 01:03:14.334
On your 3, there is a staircase.

01:03:14.917 --> 01:03:18.126
Find Joy Mart, and don't hang up.

01:03:18.292 --> 01:03:19.417
Locate Joy Mart.

01:03:25.626 --> 01:03:28.626
2nd floor, #153.

01:03:32.126 --> 01:03:33.001
I'm here.

01:03:33.001 --> 01:03:34.667
On the next shop wall, there is a note.

01:03:35.251 --> 01:03:36.376
Follow the direction.

01:03:36.376 --> 01:03:38.209
DVD Heaven has moved to #101

01:03:49.251 --> 01:03:50.042
DVD Heaven

01:03:56.709 --> 01:03:57.209
I'm here.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.042
You'll see a staircase beside it.

01:04:20.376 --> 01:04:21.709
Ji Dong-chul is in Choi's van!

01:04:45.709 --> 01:04:46.667
We lost them.

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:48.542
We're clear.

01:05:25.917 --> 01:05:26.667
Are you okay sir?

01:05:27.001 --> 01:05:28.751
- Where is the backup?
- They're approaching.

01:05:28.751 --> 01:05:30.209
Block the district bottleneck.

01:05:30.959 --> 01:05:31.584
Move in, move in!

01:05:44.584 --> 01:05:45.792
Have them ready!

01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:04.084
He's going into the parking structure.

01:06:11.834 --> 01:06:13.001
Where does this road lead?

01:06:13.376 --> 01:06:14.292
Wonhyo mall alley.

01:06:15.792 --> 01:06:19.334
Unit 3, left turn in 50m,
head to the back alley.

01:06:26.334 --> 01:06:27.667
Unit 3, hit him!

01:06:35.834 --> 01:06:37.251
Move the damn car!

01:06:59.667 --> 01:07:00.876
It leads to a residential area.

01:07:13.959 --> 01:07:15.126
Flank his right.

01:07:31.834 --> 01:07:32.709
Where's the backup?

01:07:32.792 --> 01:07:34.501
We're approaching sector 8.

01:07:36.501 --> 01:07:38.334
I'll cover the front, stay on his tail!

01:07:59.959 --> 01:08:01.001
Stay on him!

01:08:01.501 --> 01:08:02.334
There's a dead-end!

01:08:12.751 --> 01:08:14.084
Stairs, stairs!

01:08:14.917 --> 01:08:16.376
No, it's too steep!

01:08:58.542 --> 01:09:00.126
Unit 1 has rolled over!

01:09:07.417 --> 01:09:08.834
Son of a bitch!

01:09:18.626 --> 01:09:19.126
Get me backup!

01:09:20.334 --> 01:09:21.542
It'll take time, sir.

01:09:36.292 --> 01:09:37.792
What the hell?! He'll shoot!

01:09:46.376 --> 01:09:47.667
Colonel, civilians!

01:09:48.209 --> 01:09:49.876
I'm shooting the tires!

01:10:19.626 --> 01:10:21.001
What's up ahead?

01:10:21.292 --> 01:10:24.209
A small intersection and a main road in 100m.

01:10:52.667 --> 01:10:55.001
Colonel, you're coming up on a main road!

01:12:13.626 --> 01:12:16.084
I'm sorry, I got you involved.

01:12:16.792 --> 01:12:17.917
Don't worry.

01:12:19.292 --> 01:12:20.709
But the thing you mentioned...

01:12:29.001 --> 01:12:29.876
Huh?

01:12:31.084 --> 01:12:32.667
You kept it there?

01:12:42.334 --> 01:12:45.751
Nice to meet you, I'm head of NK division,
agent Shin.

01:12:46.251 --> 01:12:48.626
You tried to capture him yourself.

01:12:50.001 --> 01:12:51.417
It's all our fault.

01:12:52.667 --> 01:12:54.084
Someone tried to kill him before.

01:12:54.167 --> 01:12:57.334
'Tried to kill'? Watch your tone!

01:12:57.334 --> 01:13:00.751
Shouldn't I at least hear
why the mission is canned?

01:13:01.626 --> 01:13:03.292
Come on...

01:13:03.376 --> 01:13:06.542
You really are difficult
to talk to in a civil manner.

01:13:06.542 --> 01:13:09.626
Care to explain then? Why are you doing this?

01:13:10.251 --> 01:13:11.251
Explain?

01:13:14.417 --> 01:13:18.959
This pair of glasses was passed along
by chairman Park before his death.

01:13:20.334 --> 01:13:21.751
It looks transparent,

01:13:22.167 --> 01:13:27.292
but a microfiche is presumed to be embedded.

01:13:31.959 --> 01:13:33.501
Chemical weapon formula?

01:13:36.459 --> 01:13:38.459
It's a research lab,

01:13:38.667 --> 01:13:42.376
privately funded and built
by Park in Uzbekistan a year ago.

01:13:42.876 --> 01:13:49.042
This next-gen weapon has the explosive yield
of 4 kiloton,

01:13:49.042 --> 01:13:52.251
which is designed to withstand neutralization.

01:13:52.251 --> 01:13:56.417
It's the best gift North can ask for.

01:13:56.542 --> 01:14:00.417
So the glasses contain this formula?

01:14:28.459 --> 01:14:29.917
Looks like a chemical formula...

01:14:32.876 --> 01:14:34.084
Please...

01:14:34.084 --> 01:14:35.542
bury this...

01:14:36.209 --> 01:14:37.376
Please...

01:14:37.584 --> 01:14:41.959
A microfiche was recovered
from the chairman's glasses.

01:14:42.292 --> 01:14:45.042
We do not know the nature of its content
at this time.

01:14:48.626 --> 01:14:51.834
Park was closing his businesses recently.

01:14:52.251 --> 01:14:53.084
Naturally,

01:14:54.501 --> 01:14:57.292
he was planning to move back to the North.

01:14:57.292 --> 01:15:00.667
- So you eliminated...
- Don't presume anything.

01:15:01.626 --> 01:15:04.417
Your turn, colonel.

01:15:04.542 --> 01:15:08.042
Why are you so fixated on Ji Dong-chul?

01:15:09.376 --> 01:15:13.792
Perhaps he was liaison to the North.

01:15:13.792 --> 01:15:15.292
What are you doing?

01:15:15.501 --> 01:15:16.751
Watch it!

01:15:17.126 --> 01:15:19.792
Don't you get it already?!
Are you really that dense?

01:15:19.792 --> 01:15:22.876
Under the pretense of defection,
they committed acts of espionage,

01:15:23.209 --> 01:15:24.792
why are you defending him?

01:15:24.792 --> 01:15:26.292
I've had it with you!

01:15:26.834 --> 01:15:30.084
Remember the Hong Kong debacle?

01:15:31.834 --> 01:15:33.167
People are talking.

01:15:34.001 --> 01:15:39.542
Ji Dong-chul came back alive and so did you,
without your team.

01:15:39.626 --> 01:15:40.626
I was debriefed and cleared...

01:15:42.167 --> 01:15:43.292
In any case,

01:15:43.834 --> 01:15:48.751
you're in the same situation.

01:15:49.417 --> 01:15:50.334
Am I right?

01:15:55.501 --> 01:15:58.751
So... I'm a spy now?

01:16:06.667 --> 01:16:11.417
Your Hong Kong mission is being
reinvestigated thoroughly.

01:16:11.542 --> 01:16:16.417
We'll push for national security
and espionage charges.

01:16:20.001 --> 01:16:22.584
You'll be tried at military court soon.

01:16:31.501 --> 01:16:32.751
Good luck.

01:16:33.667 --> 01:16:35.084
I'll do my best.

01:16:38.876 --> 01:16:43.417
I brought you in to catch a spy, not to think.

01:16:45.084 --> 01:16:47.667
A thinking soldier don't last long.

01:16:47.834 --> 01:16:52.626
It's not over yet, there's still time
to reconsider.

01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:08.667
So they killed the housekeepers too then.

01:17:15.542 --> 01:17:17.959
This is what the chairman wanted to protect
till the end.

01:17:18.792 --> 01:17:20.542
We have to find out what this is first.

01:17:20.626 --> 01:17:22.417
I know someone who may be able to help.

01:17:23.167 --> 01:17:27.709
Then, we release your confession
with this formula,

01:17:28.209 --> 01:17:29.792
and clear your name.

01:17:29.792 --> 01:17:31.084
I'll be fine.

01:17:32.751 --> 01:17:34.584
I got another matter to take care of.

01:17:34.917 --> 01:17:36.917
Take care of this on your end.

01:17:38.334 --> 01:17:39.084
In return...

01:17:41.667 --> 01:17:42.209
What's wrong?

01:17:45.626 --> 01:17:46.667
Are you hurt?

01:17:51.084 --> 01:17:52.709
Did this happen in the van?

01:18:00.417 --> 01:18:02.084
Why did you say his kid is alive?

01:18:03.959 --> 01:18:07.167
Did he love her more than his wife?

01:18:13.084 --> 01:18:17.042
He has never seen her before.

01:18:22.209 --> 01:18:25.667
Indeed, I'm sick of my wife too.

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:29.167
Good work, we're almost there.

01:18:29.334 --> 01:18:33.626
Your family's at the Chinese embassy,
it's up to you now.

01:18:35.542 --> 01:18:37.167
Where's Choi Kyung-hee?

01:18:37.459 --> 01:18:40.876
- Probably with Ji.
- That bitch...

01:18:40.876 --> 01:18:42.709
I should've taken care of her.

01:18:42.917 --> 01:18:44.376
Choi, Ji and the colonel,

01:18:45.751 --> 01:18:48.959
eliminate them for good.

01:18:58.001 --> 01:18:58.709
I can do this, I can do this.

01:19:35.126 --> 01:19:36.959
Forgot to buy it again?

01:19:38.209 --> 01:19:41.042
The baby is due soon, I wanted to be prepared.

01:19:42.167 --> 01:19:44.376
I'm gonna tattle on you when she's born.

01:19:51.042 --> 01:19:52.584
Do you know?

01:19:53.417 --> 01:19:57.584
They say, talking about you
while she's the womb,

01:19:59.084 --> 01:20:02.584
she will recognize you on her first glance.

01:20:02.959 --> 01:20:07.834
But only when she's a child.

01:20:09.959 --> 01:20:15.292
I talk to her so much about you.

01:20:16.084 --> 01:20:17.209
Can you see?

01:20:18.376 --> 01:20:20.459
Daddy's home.

01:20:21.251 --> 01:20:22.667
He's home...

01:20:49.626 --> 01:20:51.792
Why aren't you answering your phone?

01:20:51.792 --> 01:20:55.042
Fucking traitor, what do you want?

01:20:55.042 --> 01:20:57.959
I'm sorry, I gotta save my neck too.

01:20:58.626 --> 01:21:00.709
I should've let you choke to death.

01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:03.751
213.213.

01:21:03.917 --> 01:21:06.167
What the hell are you blabbering on about?

01:21:07.042 --> 01:21:08.167
Come on.

01:21:14.667 --> 01:21:17.751
Go take a walk. River Terrace is quite nice.

01:21:17.959 --> 01:21:20.834
Parking lot 2, keep emergency lights on.

01:21:20.834 --> 01:21:21.709
What's your angle?

01:21:24.584 --> 01:21:27.459
You said to play both sides, already forgot?

01:21:27.459 --> 01:21:29.292
You double spying bastard!

01:21:52.042 --> 01:21:55.251
Like you said, I was a reporter.

01:21:55.709 --> 01:22:00.167
I was gonna catch the man who got me fired,

01:22:00.626 --> 01:22:04.917
and become a network reporter.

01:22:12.042 --> 01:22:15.251
What'll you do now?

01:22:20.334 --> 01:22:22.126
Those involved in this...

01:22:39.042 --> 01:22:40.292
I'll kill them all.

01:22:42.334 --> 01:22:44.542
I know you'll kill yourself too!

01:22:46.584 --> 01:22:47.751
Your daughter might be alive,

01:22:48.834 --> 01:22:50.459
she could be waiting for you.

01:23:02.751 --> 01:23:03.459
Sir!

01:23:06.459 --> 01:23:07.626
It's okay.

01:23:08.334 --> 01:23:12.292
He heads anti-redevelppment. He lived here.

01:23:12.292 --> 01:23:15.376
Don't you have money to get a room?

01:23:16.209 --> 01:23:19.584
- Shoulda said you had a man over.
- It's not like that.

01:23:20.251 --> 01:23:22.542
Has the charges been dropped?

01:23:22.626 --> 01:23:26.292
Yeah. Let's have a drink, since you're here.

01:23:41.084 --> 01:23:43.042
You should keep your phone on
if you need intel.

01:23:49.251 --> 01:23:52.542
Based on the needle mark on his sole,

01:23:52.542 --> 01:23:55.167
fatal amount of adrenaline was injected.

01:23:55.584 --> 01:23:58.251
- So the real cause is...
- Arteries were ruptured.

01:23:58.667 --> 01:24:02.501
It wasn't the gunshots, he was already dead.

01:24:06.251 --> 01:24:07.417
And this.

01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:13.792
The fingerprint on the gun is Ji's,

01:24:13.792 --> 01:24:16.501
but the print on the last bullet is different.

01:24:17.542 --> 01:24:20.584
It matches the partial print lifted
from the trigger,

01:24:20.959 --> 01:24:23.417
so the real killer likely inserted the bullets.

01:24:26.084 --> 01:24:29.959
I'll take this too.

01:24:31.042 --> 01:24:32.251
Yo, what are you doing?

01:24:39.834 --> 01:24:42.626
Why toss the car here?

01:24:47.834 --> 01:24:48.959
We found the van.

01:24:54.334 --> 01:24:58.167
Send backup teams,
and alert all local stations.

01:25:01.792 --> 01:25:02.334
Yeah?

01:25:02.334 --> 01:25:03.459
South Gajwa redevelopment area.

01:25:03.792 --> 01:25:06.042
Tact teams are en route.

01:25:06.042 --> 01:25:06.667
Okay.

01:25:06.667 --> 01:25:08.792
Get agent Kim's fingerprint
and send it to the lab.

01:25:09.001 --> 01:25:09.834
Fingerprint?

01:25:09.834 --> 01:25:11.792
Find anything of interest on his call log.

01:25:12.167 --> 01:25:14.167
And look into his deleted files too.

01:25:14.167 --> 01:25:15.667
I'm not FBI!

01:25:16.126 --> 01:25:18.709
It's easier than stealing candy from a baby!

01:25:18.876 --> 01:25:20.959
What about the firewall?

01:25:21.084 --> 01:25:22.459
You were on the counter-espionage TF.

01:25:23.501 --> 01:25:26.417
They don't change passwords afterwards.

01:25:26.417 --> 01:25:28.042
It's just an excuse to bump up security.

01:25:28.626 --> 01:25:30.792
- Shut the hell up!
- What did you say?!

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:33.876
Just kill me instead! You poked the wrong man!

01:25:34.126 --> 01:25:35.167
What the hell did you say?!

01:25:35.417 --> 01:25:38.251
I'll fucking snap your legs!
I'm hanging up, motherfucker!

01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:41.584
Debt collector.

01:25:46.876 --> 01:25:47.959
It's Ji Dong-chul.

01:25:51.417 --> 01:25:52.751
How was your breakfast?

01:25:53.126 --> 01:25:53.584
Who is this?

01:25:54.834 --> 01:25:56.209
Are the glasses safe?

01:25:56.626 --> 01:25:58.209
Have you found Lee?

01:25:59.251 --> 01:26:01.209
Of course.

01:26:01.376 --> 01:26:05.876
He'll come get the glasses,
so make nice before your demise.

01:26:06.584 --> 01:26:09.959
What do I mean? In 10 seconds...

01:26:10.542 --> 01:26:12.459
he'll snap your neck.

01:27:58.876 --> 01:27:59.709
Wake up.

01:28:01.626 --> 01:28:02.584
Where's Dong-chul?

01:29:59.667 --> 01:30:02.001
Is my daughter still alive?

01:30:04.126 --> 01:30:05.501
I told you...

01:30:07.376 --> 01:30:08.209
she's alive.

01:30:08.751 --> 01:30:10.167
I saw her dead body...

01:30:11.084 --> 01:30:12.751
with my own eyes.

01:30:14.417 --> 01:30:16.001
Why would...

01:30:18.209 --> 01:30:19.459
a dying man lie?

01:30:20.376 --> 01:30:21.584
Your kid...

01:30:23.667 --> 01:30:24.792
is alive...

01:30:27.292 --> 01:30:28.251
Believe me...

01:30:57.626 --> 01:30:59.084
You did the right thing.

01:30:59.501 --> 01:31:02.251
South is nice, especially with your family.

01:31:19.667 --> 01:31:21.417
Thanks, you'll get a premium.

01:31:21.417 --> 01:31:23.876
Kids and girls are always welcome.

01:31:33.792 --> 01:31:37.876
Agent Kim Suk-ho...sold your daughter...

01:31:41.751 --> 01:31:43.167
and killed the chairman...

01:31:46.459 --> 01:31:47.626
It was all him...

01:31:57.417 --> 01:31:58.417
Dong-chul...

01:32:03.876 --> 01:32:05.167
I'm sorry...

01:32:07.667 --> 01:32:08.709
I...

01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:14.292
wanted to live too...

01:33:01.001 --> 01:33:01.751
Got it?

01:33:03.459 --> 01:33:04.251
Good.

01:33:05.792 --> 01:33:09.126
Put out a full APB on Ji Dong-chul.

01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:12.584
He's dangerous, shoot to kill on sight.

01:34:02.542 --> 01:34:03.667
Dammit!

01:34:07.084 --> 01:34:07.709
Where's Ji?

01:34:13.792 --> 01:34:16.167
I know you were after agent Kim for a year.

01:34:16.376 --> 01:34:17.876
What you claim may all be true.

01:34:27.251 --> 01:34:28.501
Did Ji take the microfiche?

01:34:30.209 --> 01:34:31.751
You people took it!

01:34:32.751 --> 01:34:34.209
Kim Suk-ho, that fucker!

01:34:38.667 --> 01:34:39.584
Aren't you coming?

01:34:39.584 --> 01:34:41.417
Why should I come with you?

01:34:45.542 --> 01:34:46.792
Aren't you a reporter?!

01:35:00.626 --> 01:35:01.376
I see him!

01:35:04.667 --> 01:35:06.584
- Sniper unit ready.
- Target in sight.

01:35:32.667 --> 01:35:34.334
That bastard's kid is alive?

01:35:35.376 --> 01:35:37.792
I'm told agent Kim sold her off to China.

01:35:38.084 --> 01:35:39.709
He's probably after Kim's head.

01:35:40.126 --> 01:35:42.417
Do you still think Ji killed the chairman?

01:35:42.667 --> 01:35:44.126
I'll ask him in person.

01:35:45.542 --> 01:35:47.792
It was agent Kim all along.

01:35:48.209 --> 01:35:49.167
Where's the proof?

01:35:49.459 --> 01:35:51.959
Park said so himself when I interviewed him.

01:35:52.459 --> 01:35:54.542
That he and the North will exchange gifts.

01:35:57.751 --> 01:35:59.084
The suspect's on the church roof!

01:35:59.751 --> 01:36:00.501
Shoot!

01:36:28.584 --> 01:36:30.042
- Speak. - I sent the print.

01:36:30.667 --> 01:36:34.167
I checked agent Kim's call log,
it's definitely fishy.

01:36:34.417 --> 01:36:35.584
How fishy?

01:36:35.626 --> 01:36:39.167
He regularly spoke with the chairman
for a year.

01:36:39.667 --> 01:36:41.417
Many of them are outgoing calls.

01:36:41.709 --> 01:36:43.501
In return for backing Park's business
in the North,

01:36:44.084 --> 01:36:46.334
agent Kim must've wanted something.

01:36:46.542 --> 01:36:49.292
While scanning his recent log,
I found a weird number.

01:36:49.501 --> 01:36:53.001
Heard of Kim Do-soo?
The weapons dealer in Middle East.

01:36:53.251 --> 01:36:54.459
It was him!

01:36:56.292 --> 01:36:57.792
This is what he was after in return.

01:36:59.501 --> 01:37:00.876
The formula.

01:37:00.959 --> 01:37:03.876
But it doesn't make sense.

01:37:04.417 --> 01:37:06.334
The chairman would've put
safety measures in place.

01:37:06.542 --> 01:37:09.459
He was probably threatened,
because the work was done.

01:37:09.584 --> 01:37:11.542
Killed the chairman to eliminate the source.

01:37:15.292 --> 01:37:16.959
But Ji ran off with the end result?

01:37:16.959 --> 01:37:17.709
Right!

01:37:17.917 --> 01:37:22.126
Kim faked the chairman's death
but Ji got in the middle of it.

01:37:23.251 --> 01:37:23.917
Son of a bitch...

01:37:24.376 --> 01:37:26.126
Someone's with you? Sounded like a woman.

01:37:26.334 --> 01:37:28.042
I should've locked him up a long time ago.

01:37:28.667 --> 01:37:29.834
Are you with a girl?

01:37:30.334 --> 01:37:31.209
Is that all?

01:37:31.876 --> 01:37:33.501
No, there's more.

01:37:33.751 --> 01:37:35.042
Agent Kim also called a Hyejoo exec,

01:37:35.417 --> 01:37:37.209
named Song Sang-geun.

01:37:37.209 --> 01:37:38.501
Could've been about the case.

01:37:39.542 --> 01:37:41.792
An hour before his death? He called 3 times.

01:37:42.376 --> 01:37:44.042
Outta boy, good job.

01:37:44.209 --> 01:37:46.459
- So who's with you?
- Can't you go any faster?

01:37:46.459 --> 01:37:48.876
A girl, right? Sounds cute!

01:38:05.834 --> 01:38:07.001
Pain in the ass

01:38:08.876 --> 01:38:10.084
You're still alive?

01:38:10.084 --> 01:38:12.209
Fetch me 'Mr. Vengeance' DVD from the office.

01:38:12.542 --> 01:38:13.584
It's crucial data.

01:38:13.584 --> 01:38:16.001
Data? Screw that. No, I can't!

01:38:16.001 --> 01:38:19.292
- It's all in your head.
- Like hell!

01:38:19.292 --> 01:38:21.459
It's a life and death situation,
hurry the hell up!

01:38:21.459 --> 01:38:26.001
I wrote the chief a formal apology,
I might get fired.

01:38:26.001 --> 01:38:27.917
The truth is within reach
and you want to ignore it?

01:38:27.917 --> 01:38:30.376
You call yourself a reporter? You coward!

01:38:30.542 --> 01:38:31.376
Hello?

01:38:32.834 --> 01:38:34.959
I shoulda ignored it!

01:38:34.959 --> 01:38:36.542
Dammit!

01:38:41.084 --> 01:38:41.876
Block the road! Cover that side!

01:38:57.292 --> 01:38:58.209
Find him!

01:39:07.834 --> 01:39:10.167
He's in our car! Set up the barricade!

01:39:36.459 --> 01:39:38.709
Go kill Ji Dong-chul.

01:39:39.251 --> 01:39:42.459
Have a real duel like proper commies.

01:39:43.334 --> 01:39:46.209
If you don't, your family dies.

01:39:56.251 --> 01:39:57.876
Requesting support!

01:40:03.459 --> 01:40:04.834
He crossed the double lane.

01:40:09.334 --> 01:40:12.126
Eagle 1, visual on the suspect's vehicle.

01:40:27.917 --> 01:40:30.042
He's off the main road.

01:40:37.667 --> 01:40:38.709
Block off the road!

01:41:18.834 --> 01:41:19.834
Block the road!

01:41:23.667 --> 01:41:24.542
Over there!

01:41:36.251 --> 01:41:37.417
Catch up to it!

01:41:45.751 --> 01:41:47.042
Faster, asshole!

01:42:43.584 --> 01:42:47.501
Parking under Han River Express,
requesting medics!

01:43:17.876 --> 01:43:19.876
Over there! Stop the car!

01:44:20.751 --> 01:44:26.667
I'm standing at the bridge,
where Ji Dong-chul jumped off.

01:44:26.959 --> 01:44:31.542
The suspect's current status
is not yet verified.

01:44:31.709 --> 01:44:34.167
The police are coordinating with

01:44:34.334 --> 01:44:38.501
various agencies to apprehend the suspect.

01:44:38.626 --> 01:44:43.542
Security check points
are being set up around...

01:44:50.626 --> 01:44:52.376
around the city...

01:44:56.167 --> 01:44:57.626
I was born with a pair of balls...

01:45:00.084 --> 01:45:01.042
Still got them...

01:45:05.876 --> 01:45:08.542
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do!

01:45:11.917 --> 01:45:12.584
Hey!

01:45:39.084 --> 01:45:41.542
- Is that anthrax?
- It looks like it.

01:46:27.501 --> 01:46:30.001
- $30 million.
- On such short notice.

01:46:30.167 --> 01:46:31.834
Korea is the easiest country to launder money.

01:46:32.626 --> 01:46:35.292
It's a child's play here.

01:46:58.917 --> 01:46:59.834
Colonel Min.

01:47:01.334 --> 01:47:02.501
Where did you get this?

01:47:04.376 --> 01:47:06.667
- Ever heard of 'rutin'?
- ls it dangerous?

01:47:07.126 --> 01:47:08.209
The compound is...

01:47:08.542 --> 01:47:11.459
You know buckwheat?
It has a good amount of this.

01:47:11.459 --> 01:47:15.334
Because of it, buckwheat grows well
on barren and shaded soils.

01:47:15.334 --> 01:47:16.834
So is it dangerous or not?!

01:47:18.417 --> 01:47:19.542
Take a look at this.

01:47:20.084 --> 01:47:23.334
This is a compound for weaponized anthrax,

01:47:23.626 --> 01:47:27.334
and this is microbe that builds
resistance to herbicide.

01:47:28.084 --> 01:47:30.876
They look so similar that even pros
can't tell them apart.

01:47:31.126 --> 01:47:36.084
Microbes used on this strengthens
the plant's immunity.

01:47:36.292 --> 01:47:37.709
Why's it so complicated?

01:47:38.542 --> 01:47:39.626
Is it a weapon or not?!

01:47:40.417 --> 01:47:44.251
It looks like a chemical weapon
but it's a phenomenal new formula.

01:47:44.292 --> 01:47:48.792
Rutin was applied to
a new chemical weapon formula

01:47:48.917 --> 01:47:51.001
to create a modified super seed.

01:47:51.209 --> 01:47:53.417
This was the gift to the North.

01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:57.376
To solve the famine problem.

01:47:58.209 --> 01:47:59.334
That's what he meant by 'bury' this.

01:48:00.876 --> 01:48:01.751
That's right.

01:48:02.251 --> 01:48:05.251
This'd irradicate North Korea's famine.

01:48:15.042 --> 01:48:15.959
How did the deal go?

01:48:16.542 --> 01:48:18.126
Buckwheat seed?!

01:48:18.501 --> 01:48:21.084
Motherfucker! Are you kidding me!

01:48:21.667 --> 01:48:26.709
He wasn't making chemical weapons,
it was buckwheat!

01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:27.542
What?

01:48:27.542 --> 01:48:30.876
Didn't Kim Do-soo get a sample?
It's confirmed.

01:48:31.501 --> 01:48:33.376
Didn't you know he changed the research?!

01:48:33.459 --> 01:48:36.084
You expect to take over Hyejoo like this?!

01:48:36.209 --> 01:48:37.167
No, it can't be...

01:48:37.167 --> 01:48:38.792
Listen carefully!

01:48:38.876 --> 01:48:41.834
Do as I say if you want to live!

01:48:41.917 --> 01:48:45.876
From now on, this is buckwheat seed.

01:48:45.876 --> 01:48:50.167
It was buckwheat all along!
I never knew it existed, but you did!

01:48:50.167 --> 01:48:51.084
Also!

01:48:52.792 --> 01:48:57.209
My handling fee just went up,
it's now 5%, not 1%.

01:48:57.584 --> 01:49:01.334
$50 million! Have it ready in cash
before this case wraps up.

01:49:01.501 --> 01:49:02.501
Got that?!

01:49:15.667 --> 01:49:17.709
Yes, it'll start soon.

01:49:18.542 --> 01:49:20.709
Where did my camera go?

01:49:22.584 --> 01:49:27.084
A pistol was recovered
at the suspect's residence,

01:49:28.751 --> 01:49:32.626
a German-made Walther P99,

01:49:33.001 --> 01:49:34.709
which is mostly used by spies.

01:49:35.417 --> 01:49:37.626
Fingerprints on the gun

01:49:37.626 --> 01:49:42.459
were confirmed to be the ones
that belong to Ji.

01:49:43.417 --> 01:49:46.459
In order to apprehend the suspect,

01:49:46.876 --> 01:49:49.459
all available officers and agents are...

01:49:49.459 --> 01:49:50.334
It's Ji Dong-chul!

01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:54.209
There! Take the photo!

01:49:57.334 --> 01:49:58.959
Gun! He's got a gun!

01:50:02.542 --> 01:50:03.334
Everyone out!

01:50:17.626 --> 01:50:18.334
Where?

01:50:18.459 --> 01:50:19.667
Where are you?

01:50:21.376 --> 01:50:23.751
- Colonel, over here!
- Gather the reporters!

01:50:24.417 --> 01:50:25.292
What will you do?

01:50:25.292 --> 01:50:26.209
Report Choi'll take care of it.

01:50:26.667 --> 01:50:28.709
- Reporter Choi?
- She's right beside you.

01:50:49.501 --> 01:50:50.626
On the double!

01:51:21.126 --> 01:51:21.626
What the?

01:51:46.917 --> 01:51:49.834
Guest of honor shouldn't ruin the party.

01:51:56.626 --> 01:51:58.459
Just answer my questions.

01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:03.001
Where did you sell her to, asshole!

01:52:04.834 --> 01:52:07.626
Your daughter?

01:52:08.417 --> 01:52:09.584
Ji Se-bom?

01:52:10.834 --> 01:52:14.251
I know you've never seen her before.

01:52:15.626 --> 01:52:17.751
I'll fucking kill you!

01:52:22.667 --> 01:52:23.834
You can't kill me.

01:52:25.001 --> 01:52:25.834
Why?

01:52:26.584 --> 01:52:27.292
If I die.

01:52:28.917 --> 01:52:31.626
You'll never find her.

01:52:35.167 --> 01:52:37.667
Next bullet's to the head. Answer me.

01:53:00.501 --> 01:53:01.126
Out of my way.

01:53:07.292 --> 01:53:10.292
I'm sorry, sir, I was only briefed on this.

01:53:10.334 --> 01:53:11.834
What's the current situation?

01:53:18.251 --> 01:53:20.334
Attention! Attention!

01:53:44.542 --> 01:53:45.792
Changed your mind?

01:53:51.042 --> 01:53:53.376
Didn't I tell you not to get caught?

01:53:53.667 --> 01:53:54.917
Son of a bitch!

01:53:58.917 --> 01:54:00.667
You fuck...

01:54:01.542 --> 01:54:02.667
You're just a lapdog.

01:54:07.501 --> 01:54:11.542
I was gonna get rid of you, this is good.

01:54:11.542 --> 01:54:16.584
I heard you're being reinstated.

01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:23.042
This is Ji's gun,
so it'll work out in my favor.

01:54:24.084 --> 01:54:25.084
Everything's tied up.

01:54:25.876 --> 01:54:27.959
<i>2</i> birds with 1 stone.

01:54:44.084 --> 01:54:45.209
Please let me go.

01:54:45.626 --> 01:54:46.667
Then I'll die!

01:55:04.792 --> 01:55:06.667
Eyes front!

01:55:07.709 --> 01:55:09.376
At attention!

01:55:10.001 --> 01:55:12.126
Turn around!

01:55:15.084 --> 01:55:16.001
Listen up!

01:55:16.459 --> 01:55:19.876
Reporter Choi has an exclusive for you!

01:56:01.501 --> 01:56:05.334
Why do you have to be so difficult?

01:56:12.417 --> 01:56:14.126
This entire case was

01:56:14.126 --> 01:56:20.167
conspired by NSIA's Kim Suk-ho
and Hyejoo's Song Sang-geun.

01:56:20.542 --> 01:56:22.959
When will you take care of Park?

01:56:22.959 --> 01:56:25.917
I'll do it myself, so don't worry.

01:56:26.834 --> 01:56:29.209
In a full confession,

01:56:29.209 --> 01:56:33.084
Song stated that in order
to take over the company,

01:56:33.334 --> 01:56:36.209
he conspired with agent Kim
to kill chairman Park.

01:56:37.501 --> 01:56:41.209
In exchange for his assistance...

01:56:41.209 --> 01:56:43.501
This was my swan song...

01:56:48.334 --> 01:56:50.751
It's all your fucking fault!

01:57:03.792 --> 01:57:05.417
Gun sounds different without any bullets.

01:57:06.209 --> 01:57:07.542
Can't you tell?

01:57:16.376 --> 01:57:19.876
Moron, I just told you it sounds different.

01:57:26.334 --> 01:57:30.209
Feel this too, to stare at the end of a barrel!

01:57:31.334 --> 01:57:33.042
I feel this everyday.

01:57:34.667 --> 01:57:37.292
What's the point? There's no bullet.

01:57:38.334 --> 01:57:39.126
No,

01:57:40.751 --> 01:57:42.042
I got one, right here.

01:57:44.126 --> 01:57:44.834
Mine?

01:57:57.167 --> 01:58:00.667
If you fire it, the evidence is gone.

01:58:08.167 --> 01:58:09.334
Shoot me.

01:58:13.959 --> 01:58:15.584
Go on!

01:58:23.751 --> 01:58:24.834
Son of a bitch!

01:58:34.501 --> 01:58:35.751
Motherfucker!

01:58:48.501 --> 01:58:49.751
Where's my daughter?

01:58:51.167 --> 01:58:53.501
Who did you sell her off to?!

01:58:54.876 --> 01:58:55.959
You...

01:58:57.334 --> 01:58:59.376
came this far for your kid?

01:59:02.001 --> 01:59:05.542
Tell me before I snap your neck!

01:59:09.876 --> 01:59:11.292
Isn't living...

01:59:13.751 --> 01:59:15.542
harder...

01:59:18.084 --> 01:59:19.126
than dying?

01:59:24.584 --> 01:59:26.042
Please tell me.

01:59:31.042 --> 01:59:32.376
Please...

01:59:33.876 --> 01:59:36.376
Already dead.

01:59:38.792 --> 01:59:40.751
Isn't that obvious?

02:00:05.167 --> 02:00:07.167
Target in sight. Stand by.

02:00:07.251 --> 02:00:08.876
Hostage safety is imperative.

02:00:09.501 --> 02:00:11.167
Target 3m away from hostage.

02:00:19.042 --> 02:00:19.751
Countdown.

02:00:21.834 --> 02:00:22.584
2...

02:00:32.501 --> 02:00:33.501
Hostage is safe.

02:00:34.334 --> 02:00:38.167
- Verify target location.
- Target out of range.

02:00:41.626 --> 02:00:42.667
Confirm hostage safety.

02:00:50.667 --> 02:00:55.626
Do you know how many leverages I have?

02:00:56.042 --> 02:01:01.501
I bought off your boss,
his boss and the boss of his boss.

02:01:02.209 --> 02:01:06.251
Money trumps everything in this country.

02:01:11.626 --> 02:01:15.001
I'll get you off the espionage charges,

02:01:15.667 --> 02:01:19.792
so arrest that commie.

02:02:37.042 --> 02:02:38.251
Dumb fuck...

02:03:48.834 --> 02:03:50.376
Who shot agent Kim?

02:03:50.376 --> 02:03:53.126
What's DSC's official stance?

02:03:54.584 --> 02:03:56.626
What'll happen to Hyejoo's Song?

02:03:57.001 --> 02:03:59.167
What about Ji Dong-chul?

02:04:32.834 --> 02:04:33.959
Great work, colonel.

02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:37.917
Hand him over to NSIA. We'll take it from here.

02:04:38.417 --> 02:04:41.584
Come to DSC, after his debrief.

02:04:42.334 --> 02:04:43.126
What?

02:04:46.126 --> 02:04:46.876
Wait!

02:04:52.251 --> 02:04:53.917
Get them back! Back!

02:04:55.626 --> 02:04:58.709
This contains agent Kim's deleted files.

02:04:58.917 --> 02:05:00.334
He sold anything that was worth a damn.

02:05:01.042 --> 02:05:04.334
National security docs, and even the defectors.

02:05:04.792 --> 02:05:05.876
What about what I asked for?

02:05:07.584 --> 02:05:08.334
Here.

02:05:09.542 --> 02:05:13.042
Top Chinese organ dealer addresses.
It's from Kim's contacts.

02:05:14.667 --> 02:05:16.001
Dunno if his kid's still alive.

02:05:16.626 --> 02:05:17.709
Alright, wrap things up here.

02:05:18.001 --> 02:05:18.751
Salute!

02:05:19.709 --> 02:05:20.584
Clear the road!

02:05:22.459 --> 02:05:25.667
The conspiracy behind this murder case

02:05:25.667 --> 02:05:32.792
was devised by NSIA's Kim Suk-ho
and Hyejoo Group's Song Sang-geun,

02:05:32.792 --> 02:05:37.251
and both organizations will be
heavily criticized by this outcome.

02:05:37.334 --> 02:05:39.417
The National Assembly has revealed that

02:05:39.417 --> 02:05:42.292
a special committee will investigate
this case thoroughly,

02:05:42.292 --> 02:05:46.501
and suspect Ji Dong-chul
will be debriefed shortly...

02:05:58.459 --> 02:05:59.709
Remember that photo?

02:06:27.834 --> 02:06:29.709
Shandon, Yongchun #73, China

02:06:40.376 --> 02:06:42.084
Gonna buy some smokes, stay put.

02:06:49.709 --> 02:06:51.917
Don't give me that look,
I might start liking you.

02:08:20.042 --> 02:08:22.084
I can't believe this.

02:08:24.501 --> 02:08:25.751
Will you keep this up?

02:08:29.042 --> 02:08:30.292
Testimony - Min Se-hun.

02:08:30.376 --> 02:08:32.084
Defense Security Command

02:08:35.917 --> 02:08:37.126
Colonel Min!

02:08:38.251 --> 02:08:40.209
Stop this farce!

02:08:41.126 --> 02:08:42.209
I'm serious.

02:08:42.876 --> 02:08:45.126
I went to buy smokes and he was gone.

02:08:47.917 --> 02:08:48.959
What?

02:08:52.167 --> 02:08:53.959
Don't you speak Korean?!

02:08:54.209 --> 02:08:55.542
He escaped! Fled!

02:09:00.209 --> 02:09:01.876
You're driving me nuts!

02:09:06.001 --> 02:09:07.167
Seriously...

02:09:08.834 --> 02:09:12.084
In exchange for forfeiting
nuclear weapons program,

02:09:12.084 --> 02:09:18.167
North Korea have received genetically
modified buckwheat seeds.

02:09:18.459 --> 02:09:22.751
The President congratulated the North
and wished that

02:09:23.001 --> 02:09:26.501
