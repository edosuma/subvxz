04:37.702 --> 04:39.536
Surprise!

04:40.121 --> 04:42.741
Happy Birthday, Daddy!

04:52.216 --> 04:53.800
Make a wish!

04:54.051 --> 04:56.136
I wish...
I'm not going to tell you.

04:56.387 --> 04:58.263
Come on, blow them out!

05:03.394 --> 05:04.895
Give me some sugar, girl.

05:05.396 --> 05:08.398
One more candle and the smoke alarm
would've gone off.

05:12.737 --> 05:14.237
The big 5-0.

05:16.032 --> 05:19.618
You know, your beard's getting gray.
Kind of makes you look old.

05:19.827 --> 05:21.703
It's all right. I still love you.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.456
Bye, Pa.

07:12.523 --> 07:14.941
Good morning!

07:15.526 --> 07:18.153
- Where's Rianne?
- She's upstairs.

07:19.572 --> 07:21.281
Good morning.

07:21.532 --> 07:23.533
- That's my bacon!
- It's mine now.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.910
Don't you close doors around here?

07:26.120 --> 07:27.829
Baby, what's this on my tie?

07:29.332 --> 07:30.915
That is an ugly spot.

07:31.167 --> 07:33.376
Thanks. Sharp as a tack.

07:33.669 --> 07:36.046
I'm thinking of going on Jeopardy.

07:36.672 --> 07:39.090
Just don't take any questions
about cooking.

07:43.554 --> 07:45.347
Don't step in the egg!

07:46.557 --> 07:50.060
What am I thinking? I should have
checked the floor for egg!

07:51.854 --> 07:55.398
Do you know a man named
Michael Hunsaker?

07:58.402 --> 08:00.362
Jesus! Michael Hunsaker!

08:00.738 --> 08:02.656
- What did he want?
- Your office called.

08:02.990 --> 08:05.116
He's tried to reach you for three days.

08:05.368 --> 08:07.202
I haven't talked to him in...

08:08.996 --> 08:10.330
...twelve years!

08:11.165 --> 08:12.499
Wait a minute.

08:12.708 --> 08:14.709
That would make me...

08:15.711 --> 08:17.087
...fifty!

08:17.713 --> 08:19.214
That means that you're...

08:20.257 --> 08:21.800
We're not gonna discuss it.

08:22.093 --> 08:23.718
Forget the eggs.

08:27.390 --> 08:29.724
How come I never heard
of Michael Hunsaker?

08:29.975 --> 08:31.685
Just never talked about him.

08:31.936 --> 08:33.395
Vietnam buddy?

08:33.729 --> 08:35.730
Eat your own cake. Vietnam buddy.

08:37.607 --> 08:39.400
Nick and the kids
left without me.

08:39.652 --> 08:43.113
He left without you? Come on,
I never get enough of my baby.

08:43.322 --> 08:46.991
This is my New Year's Eve dress.
Do you like it? Isn't it cool?

08:47.243 --> 08:48.618
It's beautiful.

08:50.538 --> 08:52.372
Have a good birthday.

09:00.923 --> 09:02.632
Goddamn heartbreaker!

09:15.771 --> 09:17.772
Happy birthday, Rog!

09:27.408 --> 09:28.783
We got a hooker.

09:29.076 --> 09:32.662
No, it's Dixie. Would you please
tell these bozos to lay off?

09:33.080 --> 09:34.164
You bozos, lay off.

09:34.415 --> 09:37.167
Had a jumper here last night.
She saw it happen.

09:37.418 --> 09:39.294
Get her statement, send her home.

09:39.587 --> 09:42.213
Thanks. I'm beat.
You know how it is.

09:42.965 --> 09:44.674
All dressed up, no one to blow.

09:45.676 --> 09:48.470
You're hilarious!
I can't believe you damn cops!

09:48.721 --> 09:51.389
The jumper's name is Amanda Hunsaker.

09:52.183 --> 09:53.808
Age 22.

09:54.101 --> 09:58.062
Prostitute. One arrest,
no convictions. Born in Tennessee.

09:58.314 --> 09:59.981
- Parents...
- What was the name?

10:01.317 --> 10:02.859
The parents.

10:03.944 --> 10:05.487
Michael and Claire.

10:06.697 --> 10:07.989
You know them?

10:08.991 --> 10:12.035
Right. Find out who bought it,
who's paying the bills.

10:12.286 --> 10:14.871
- That will take some looking into.
- So look!

10:41.941 --> 10:43.316
Hello, honey.

10:44.527 --> 10:47.028
Give me the number
for Michael Hunsaker.

10:47.321 --> 10:49.948
The man we talked about?
Your Vietnam buddy?

10:50.241 --> 10:53.368
- You just mentioned him this morning.
- What's wrong?

10:53.577 --> 10:55.870
His daughter just dove out a window.

11:00.751 --> 11:02.001
I got it.

11:21.397 --> 11:23.314
Good, huh? Tasty? Smooth?

11:26.402 --> 11:29.279
- Yeah, that's good.
- You better fucking believe it.

11:29.905 --> 11:31.573
Let's do it. How much?

11:31.824 --> 11:33.533
How much for how much?

11:34.285 --> 11:35.451
For all of it.

11:35.703 --> 11:38.788
You want it all? He wants it all.

11:38.998 --> 11:41.916
- All right!
- Maybe a nice tree to put it under.

11:42.710 --> 11:44.168
You want a tree?

11:44.420 --> 11:45.920
I'll tell you what.

11:46.297 --> 11:49.090
I'll give you the best tree
on the lot for nothing.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.801
But the shit's gonna cost you...

11:52.595 --> 11:53.803
...a hundred.

11:54.054 --> 11:55.054
That much?

11:55.222 --> 11:56.973
That's a fair price.

11:59.351 --> 12:00.602
You only live once.

12:01.478 --> 12:02.812
Get this together here.

12:04.231 --> 12:05.899
20, 40...

12:06.150 --> 12:07.317
...50, 70...

12:07.526 --> 12:10.695
- What the fuck?
- Hey, man!

12:12.031 --> 12:13.406
Shut up, I'm losing count.

12:13.824 --> 12:16.326
93, 94, 95, 96...

12:16.827 --> 12:18.077
Forget it, dumbshit!

12:18.704 --> 12:20.413
One hundred thousand!

12:20.831 --> 12:23.124
One hundred thousand dollars!

12:24.627 --> 12:26.127
A hundred thousand?

12:26.462 --> 12:30.840
I can't afford that. Not on my salary.
But look, I got a better idea.

12:31.342 --> 12:35.637
Let me say I take the whole stash
off your hands for free...

12:36.847 --> 12:39.849
...and you assholes go to jail.
What do you say?

12:41.644 --> 12:45.855
I could read you your rights, but you
already know what your rights are.

12:49.610 --> 12:51.069
This badge ain't real.

12:51.528 --> 12:52.612
You ain't real.

12:52.863 --> 12:55.281
You sure are a crazy son of a bitch.

12:57.701 --> 12:58.701
I'm crazy?

12:59.787 --> 13:01.871
You think I am crazy?

13:02.039 --> 13:03.665
I'll show you...

13:07.378 --> 13:10.213
That's a real badge, I'm a real cop
and this is a real gun.

13:11.548 --> 13:12.548
Okay, pal.

13:12.925 --> 13:14.550
Noses in the dirt, assholes!

13:26.897 --> 13:28.189
Where's your buddy?

13:32.236 --> 13:33.236
What do you got?

13:33.529 --> 13:36.823
Three down and one loose.
He's got a red shirt.

13:37.074 --> 13:38.491
Okay, let's go.

13:40.536 --> 13:43.413
Freeze! Give me the gun! Up, up!

13:44.415 --> 13:46.040
How's it feel, sucker?

13:46.542 --> 13:47.583
Shoot him!

13:47.793 --> 13:48.793
Drop it!

13:49.086 --> 13:50.712
Shoot him! Shoot him!

13:51.088 --> 13:53.506
- Shut the fuck up!
- Shoot this prick!

13:54.717 --> 13:57.218
Shoot him! Somebody
shoot this prick!

13:57.553 --> 13:58.928
Shoot me.

13:59.221 --> 14:01.472
Shut up! Put them down!

14:01.849 --> 14:04.934
- I warn you! I'm going to shoot you!
- Shoot him!

14:05.144 --> 14:06.936
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

14:07.187 --> 14:09.313
Shoot me! Shoot him!

14:16.864 --> 14:18.239
Get him out of there.

14:19.742 --> 14:21.242
It ain't worth it.

14:30.002 --> 14:31.461
Hey, wait up already!

16:59.943 --> 17:01.611
Merry Christmas!

17:29.890 --> 17:31.682
I miss you...

17:34.353 --> 17:36.020
...Victoria Lynn.

17:49.993 --> 17:51.994
That's silly, isn't it?

17:57.793 --> 17:59.585
I'll see you later.

18:01.421 --> 18:03.339
I'll see you much later.

18:09.554 --> 18:12.181
Once more with feeling on three.

18:13.183 --> 18:17.186
Damn it, Cooley. Do it on three,
or go on the street.

18:21.775 --> 18:24.443
Silent night

18:25.487 --> 18:28.072
Are you telling me
Riggs is playing a game?

18:28.407 --> 18:31.784
Sure. He wants the cash.
But he'll come around.

18:32.077 --> 18:34.370
That's a very dangerous
attitude to take.

18:34.579 --> 18:39.292
Remember, his wife of 11 years
was just killed in a car accident.

18:39.668 --> 18:43.421
- He pulls his gun when he shouldn't.
- I know all about him.

18:43.714 --> 18:44.880
He's a tough bastard.

18:45.090 --> 18:48.384
He's on the edge. I'm telling you,
he may be psychotic.

18:48.552 --> 18:50.553
That's a bunch of psych bullshit.

18:50.721 --> 18:53.597
You're making a mistake
by keeping him in the field.

18:53.932 --> 18:55.599
The man is suicidal.

18:55.892 --> 18:58.686
You're sure of that diagnosis?
You have no doubts?

18:58.937 --> 19:00.604
There are no absolutes in life.

19:00.897 --> 19:03.441
End of discussion.
We're going to wait.

19:03.817 --> 19:06.402
If he offs himself,
then we'll know I was wrong.

19:06.611 --> 19:09.947
You're making a mistake,
because if you're wrong...

19:17.122 --> 19:18.831
Asshole!

19:19.374 --> 19:21.959
Roger, you're
way behind the times.

19:22.252 --> 19:26.130
The guys in the 80s aren't tough.
They're sensitive people.

19:26.548 --> 19:29.550
They show emotions around women,
shit like that.

19:31.261 --> 19:32.845
I think I'm an 80s man.

19:33.096 --> 19:34.597
How do you figure?

19:34.848 --> 19:36.265
Last night...

19:36.641 --> 19:38.642
...I cried in bed. How's that?

19:41.730 --> 19:43.397
Were you with a woman?

19:43.857 --> 19:47.276
I was alone. Why do you think
I was crying? Merry Christmas.

19:47.569 --> 19:49.653
Sounds like an 80s man to me.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.865
- News on the Hunsaker case.
- That was quick.

19:53.116 --> 19:56.494
So was the autopsy.
They're not calling it a suicide.

19:57.120 --> 20:01.082
Surprise, surprise. The coroner
found evidence she used barbiturates.

20:01.792 --> 20:03.292
Brilliant detective work.

20:03.460 --> 20:05.169
There were pills all over.

20:05.462 --> 20:07.797
Right. That's not the surprise.

20:08.131 --> 20:10.633
The surprise is the pills were doctored.

20:11.176 --> 20:13.677
The capsules were loaded
with drain cleaner.

20:13.929 --> 20:15.137
She'd have died anyway.

20:15.305 --> 20:16.305
This case stinks.

20:16.598 --> 20:20.309
You know,
you looked younger with the beard.

20:20.977 --> 20:22.311
Thanks, captain.

20:24.147 --> 20:25.272
You shaved the beard.

20:25.690 --> 20:26.982
Some detective.

20:27.484 --> 20:28.818
Two more things.

20:29.694 --> 20:32.154
The condition
of the sheets indicates...

20:32.489 --> 20:35.491
...someone else was
in bed with Amanda. That's "A."

20:35.700 --> 20:36.826
What's "B"?

20:36.993 --> 20:40.204
"B" is, you're breaking in
a new partner on this.

20:40.580 --> 20:41.664
Partner again?

20:41.832 --> 20:45.292
Some cat on loan from Dope.
Real burnout, on the edge.

20:45.627 --> 20:46.669
Perfect.

20:49.214 --> 20:50.256
Gun!

20:57.180 --> 20:58.889
Rog, meet your new partner.

21:02.686 --> 21:05.354
I'm too old for this shit.

21:09.651 --> 21:12.111
There are those who
say you're a good cop.

21:12.362 --> 21:13.737
I try.

21:14.448 --> 21:18.451
I heard about the little
stunt yesterday. Pretty heroic.

21:20.704 --> 21:22.371
I pulled your file.

21:22.706 --> 21:26.459
Said you worked in the Phoenix
project in Vietnam. That right?

21:26.668 --> 21:29.628
Assassination stuff.
It's over, you know.

21:30.130 --> 21:31.422
What is?

21:32.132 --> 21:33.132
The war.

21:33.383 --> 21:34.967
Yes, I know.

21:35.302 --> 21:36.969
Just thought I'd remind you.

21:39.097 --> 21:41.432
That's some serious shit you carry.

21:42.893 --> 21:44.560
Be my guest.

21:49.399 --> 21:53.152
9mm Beretta. Takes 15 in the mag,
one up the pipe...

21:53.487 --> 21:57.072
...wide ejection port, no feed jams.

21:57.449 --> 21:58.574
What have you got?

21:58.783 --> 21:59.909
Four-inch Smith.

22:01.453 --> 22:02.578
Six-shooter?

22:04.122 --> 22:05.748
A lot of old-timers carry those.

22:10.086 --> 22:12.755
File also said you're heavy
into martial arts.

22:12.964 --> 22:16.342
Tai chi and all that killer stuff.

22:16.676 --> 22:19.970
I suppose we have to register you
as a lethal weapon.

22:20.805 --> 22:24.683
Let's just cut the shit.
We both know why I was transferred.

22:24.935 --> 22:29.271
Everybody thinks I'm suicidal,
so nobody wants to work with me.

22:29.481 --> 22:31.941
Some think I'm faking
to draw psycho pension...

22:32.192 --> 22:36.153
...so nobody wants to work with me.
Basically, I'm fucked.

22:36.363 --> 22:37.446
Guess what?

22:37.822 --> 22:40.366
- I don't want to work with you.
- Then don't.

22:40.659 --> 22:44.787
Ain't got no choice.
Looks like we both got fucked.

22:44.955 --> 22:45.955
Terrific.

22:50.126 --> 22:51.877
God hates me, is what it is.

22:53.004 --> 22:55.214
Hate Him back. It works for me.

23:13.316 --> 23:15.818
- Good afternoon, Mr. Mendez.
- How you doing?

23:16.027 --> 23:17.319
Did you pat him down?

23:17.529 --> 23:20.197
- We went through this already.
- Go through it again.

23:20.532 --> 23:21.699
Who are you?

23:22.117 --> 23:25.035
That's hardly important,
but you may call me Mr. Joshua.

23:25.328 --> 23:26.328
Let's go.

23:26.538 --> 23:28.872
Great, swell. Mr. Joshua, huh?

23:33.670 --> 23:35.546
General, Mr. Mendez is here.

23:39.217 --> 23:43.053
You call this music? I can get
a better band for half the price.

23:43.388 --> 23:47.057
I don't want to hear any of this shit.
Let's get it right.

23:49.352 --> 23:51.395
Mr. Mendez, how are you?

23:51.855 --> 23:52.938
I'm fine.

23:53.648 --> 23:56.066
Where did you get him?
Psychos "R" Us?

23:56.276 --> 23:57.693
I don't think you're funny.

23:57.902 --> 24:00.654
I don't think this whole
goddamn setup is funny.

24:00.905 --> 24:03.574
You're using mercenaries.
Tell me I'm wrong!

24:04.034 --> 24:05.200
You're not wrong.

24:05.577 --> 24:07.870
And you expect me to trust these bozos?

24:08.163 --> 24:10.414
My people are loyal to me.

24:10.749 --> 24:12.249
Bullshit.

24:12.667 --> 24:13.751
Do you smoke?

24:14.044 --> 24:16.003
What does that have to do with it?

24:16.171 --> 24:17.171
Do you smoke?!

24:19.382 --> 24:20.716
Give me your lighter.

24:21.217 --> 24:22.926
- My lighter?
- Your lighter!

24:23.428 --> 24:24.720
Okay. Right here.

24:25.388 --> 24:26.472
Here. Take it.

24:26.723 --> 24:29.433
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

24:29.768 --> 24:31.060
Shut your mouth!

24:31.311 --> 24:32.686
Shut up!

24:33.104 --> 24:34.438
And don't move.

24:38.610 --> 24:41.195
Mr. Joshua, your left arm, please.

24:49.954 --> 24:54.124
Hey, you guys are fucking gone.
You know what I am saying?

24:54.459 --> 24:56.460
Jesus Christ, man!

24:57.462 --> 25:00.798
You guys are fucking
crazy, man. Come on!

25:05.595 --> 25:07.721
Have Endo look at that, Mr. Joshua.

25:09.766 --> 25:11.016
Yes, sir.

25:12.519 --> 25:14.645
You wish to do business with us, yes?

25:14.938 --> 25:16.105
Jesus Christ!

25:16.314 --> 25:18.732
You wish to make a purchase, yes?

25:20.026 --> 25:22.236
Yes, yes! Jesus Christ, yes.

25:24.614 --> 25:28.033
You guys are out there like
fucking Pluto, man. You're gone!

25:28.326 --> 25:32.454
The heroin will be here Friday night.
We'll make delivery at that time.

25:32.789 --> 25:34.873
Have the money ready, and no tricks.

25:35.166 --> 25:38.460
If you try anything,
you'll have to talk to Mr. Joshua.

25:39.671 --> 25:42.005
Right. Joshua. I got you.

25:43.007 --> 25:44.508
Merry Christmas.

25:44.759 --> 25:47.678
Yeah, right. You too, pal.

25:59.482 --> 26:00.691
Mike...

26:01.860 --> 26:06.655
...the autopsy report showed
that Amanda was poisoned.

26:07.574 --> 26:09.992
Even if she hadn't jumped,
she'd still be dead.

26:11.703 --> 26:14.371
She was murdered.

26:18.835 --> 26:20.210
Jesus!

26:24.674 --> 26:27.593
I can't take this.
I just can't take this.

26:31.598 --> 26:33.724
Why did you try
to get in touch with me?

26:37.562 --> 26:39.563
I heard that you were...

26:40.899 --> 26:43.734
Somebody told me you were
working out here.

26:46.029 --> 26:48.071
I thought you could get her out.

26:48.448 --> 26:50.032
Get her out of what?

26:52.952 --> 26:57.581
Get her out of the stuff she was into.
She was making...

26:58.208 --> 26:59.583
...videotapes.

27:01.461 --> 27:02.753
Pornographic...

27:04.088 --> 27:06.048
...videotapes.

27:06.424 --> 27:10.469
I thought maybe you could just
get her out. Help her.

27:24.275 --> 27:25.609
Easy, Mike.

27:32.575 --> 27:34.368
You owe me, Roger.

27:35.495 --> 27:36.495
Remember?

27:43.920 --> 27:45.170
I remember.

27:46.089 --> 27:49.299
I want you to find whoever's
responsible for this...

27:50.468 --> 27:52.803
...however many of them there are.

27:55.515 --> 27:59.393
I know you can do it.
Just find them and kill them.

27:59.686 --> 28:01.103
I'm a police officer.

28:01.312 --> 28:04.314
I don't give a shit
that you're a police officer!

28:04.774 --> 28:06.775
Kill them! Just kill them!

28:07.694 --> 28:09.486
Wait. Wait, Rog.

28:09.696 --> 28:12.155
Come on. You find them
and you kill them.

28:12.448 --> 28:15.534
You can do that. You owe me.

28:19.622 --> 28:20.956
I owe you.

28:23.042 --> 28:24.710
Gotta go, man.

28:32.343 --> 28:34.970
What did he mean
when he said you owed him?

28:35.221 --> 28:37.556
We served together in 1965.

28:37.974 --> 28:41.643
La Drang Valley. Saved my life.
Took a bayonet in the lungs.

28:41.936 --> 28:44.563
- That was nice of him.
- I thought so.

28:44.939 --> 28:47.941
- Want me to drive?
- You're supposed to be suicidal.

28:48.318 --> 28:50.944
Anybody who drives
in this town is suicidal.

28:51.237 --> 28:55.240
All units, possible jumper
at Santa Monica and Orlando.

28:55.658 --> 28:57.993
7-A-21, handle code two.

28:59.454 --> 29:02.706
- All units, come in, please.
- Gotcha!

29:03.166 --> 29:05.584
- What's the number of the car?
- 3-William-56.

29:05.835 --> 29:09.838
3-William-56 en route.
I love this job! It's so exciting!

29:10.048 --> 29:12.716
Copy.
Police psychologist on the way.

29:14.344 --> 29:16.762
Hey, boss, can we put the sirens on?

29:31.486 --> 29:33.195
Guys, I'm glad you're here.

29:33.404 --> 29:35.864
- Where's the psychologist?
- Stuck in traffic.

29:36.074 --> 29:37.199
Who's this guy?

29:37.367 --> 29:41.620
Name's McCleary. He was at an
office party and just went outside.

29:41.871 --> 29:44.790
- You think he'll go?
- Seems serious enough. Who knows?

29:45.917 --> 29:47.918
- I can handle this.
- Are you qualified?

29:48.211 --> 29:50.295
- I've done it before.
- You're elected.

29:51.297 --> 29:54.216
- No guns, just bring him down.
- Roger.

29:54.801 --> 29:56.134
10-4.

30:13.027 --> 30:14.945
- Who are you?
- Riggs, homicide.

30:15.238 --> 30:17.072
He's over there on the ledge.

30:28.418 --> 30:29.835
Merry Christmas.

30:30.753 --> 30:32.838
Leave me alone!

30:33.256 --> 30:34.256
What are you doing?

30:34.632 --> 30:36.091
None of your damn business!

30:36.801 --> 30:38.427
Fair enough.

30:39.053 --> 30:41.763
I'm just going to
come out there, okay?

30:41.973 --> 30:44.558
Don't!
You touch me, I'm gonna jump!

30:46.185 --> 30:48.270
Take it easy, for chrissake!

30:48.563 --> 30:50.814
I don't like this
any better than you do.

30:51.607 --> 30:53.442
I can't stand heights.

30:53.651 --> 30:54.943
This makes me dizzy.

30:55.111 --> 30:57.612
Just give me a chance
to talk to you.

31:00.324 --> 31:02.451
I'm gonna stand
on the ledge with you.

31:02.827 --> 31:05.287
Don't go. Not out on the ledge.

31:06.205 --> 31:09.583
You're not the first guy
to think of this, you know.

31:09.876 --> 31:12.711
A lot of people got problems
during this season.

31:13.463 --> 31:16.214
- You know shit!
- No, you're wrong, pal.

31:16.632 --> 31:18.884
You know nothing! Don't touch me!

31:19.218 --> 31:20.802
I didn't do anything wrong!

31:21.095 --> 31:23.972
I know that. It's not like
you're murdering anyone.

31:24.223 --> 31:26.141
- That's right!
- That's right.

31:26.642 --> 31:29.144
The only one I hurt is me! Me!

31:29.312 --> 31:31.980
That's right. I know
you're hurting. I get it.

31:33.149 --> 31:34.733
Don't come near me!

31:35.026 --> 31:37.402
Give me a break.
My boss is watching me.

31:37.653 --> 31:40.363
I got to make it look
like I'm trying to save you.

31:41.199 --> 31:42.199
Come on.

31:43.826 --> 31:47.245
I'm just gonna stand here
and talk to you. That's all.

31:47.914 --> 31:50.373
You won't try nothing?

31:50.666 --> 31:52.876
I'm square with you.
I won't try a thing.

31:53.336 --> 31:57.214
You think I want to fall off?
I promise, I'll just talk to you.

31:58.674 --> 31:59.925
All right.

32:00.343 --> 32:03.887
Here, you want a cigarette?
Come on, let's smoke, okay?

32:04.806 --> 32:06.389
Go on, take it.

32:06.682 --> 32:09.017
Take our time and both die of cancer.

32:25.284 --> 32:26.660
See this key?

32:27.203 --> 32:28.370
Bye-bye!

32:28.955 --> 32:30.038
You're crazy!

32:30.248 --> 32:34.209
You can jump, but you'd take me
with you, making you a murderer.

32:34.460 --> 32:36.670
- You bastard!
- You'd be killing a cop.

32:36.879 --> 32:38.421
Yeah, a psycho nut cop!

32:38.714 --> 32:40.799
I'm still a cop.
You coming in?

32:41.050 --> 32:43.718
- I'm jumping!
- Do you really wanna jump?

32:43.886 --> 32:47.264
Do you wanna?
That's fine with me. Come on!

32:47.598 --> 32:49.224
Let's do it, asshole.

32:49.433 --> 32:51.059
I want to do it.

33:03.948 --> 33:05.240
Shit!

33:12.748 --> 33:14.291
You want to go up again?

33:14.584 --> 33:16.251
Come on, it was great.

33:18.588 --> 33:20.922
Help me! Help me loose!

33:21.465 --> 33:23.091
He's trying to kill me!

33:23.467 --> 33:26.803
Did you see that?
He's out of his mind! He's crazy!

33:27.096 --> 33:29.264
I want my cuffs back.

33:29.599 --> 33:32.601
- Don't you touch me!
- What the fuck did you just do?

33:32.935 --> 33:36.104
I controlled the jump!
You wanted him down? He's down!

33:36.355 --> 33:37.480
Come here!

33:37.940 --> 33:39.482
Come here with me!

33:50.786 --> 33:52.537
Get in here!

33:56.334 --> 34:00.295
Okay, no bullshit!
You want to kill yourself?

34:00.546 --> 34:02.756
Shut up! Yes or no?
You want to die?

34:03.507 --> 34:05.175
I got the job done!

34:05.509 --> 34:07.344
Just answer the question!

34:07.553 --> 34:09.471
What do you want to hear, man?

34:09.679 --> 34:12.306
That sometimes I think about
eating a bullet?

34:13.643 --> 34:14.851
Well, I do!

34:15.143 --> 34:18.313
I got a special one for the occasion,
with a hollow point.

34:18.688 --> 34:22.025
Make sure it blows
the back of my goddamn head out!

34:22.485 --> 34:25.527
Every day I wake up and think
of a reason not to do it.

34:25.821 --> 34:27.989
Every single day.

34:28.699 --> 34:31.993
And you know why I don't?
This is gonna make you laugh.

34:32.286 --> 34:35.330
The job. Doing the job.
That's the reason.

34:35.873 --> 34:39.292
- You want to die!
- I don't. I'm not afraid of it.

34:39.793 --> 34:43.588
Here, take my gun. Don't nibble
on the barrel, pull the trigger.

34:43.839 --> 34:46.216
Be my guest!
Go ahead, if you're serious!

34:46.592 --> 34:48.342
You shouldn't tempt me.

34:49.178 --> 34:53.056
In your mouth. Bullet may go
through your ear and not kill you.

34:53.349 --> 34:55.350
Under the chin's just as good!

35:12.326 --> 35:15.370
You're not trying
to draw a psycho pension.

35:17.081 --> 35:19.082
You really are crazy.

35:23.546 --> 35:27.716
I'm hungry. I'm gonna go
and get something to eat.

35:38.477 --> 35:43.606
I don't know. He's hurting. There's
something eating away at this guy.

35:43.899 --> 35:48.236
I think he's on the edge.
I think Riggs has a death wish.

35:48.738 --> 35:52.407
Terrific. So you're
saying I should worry?

35:53.743 --> 35:55.410
I think you should worry.

35:55.619 --> 35:57.954
When he goes,
you don't want to be near him.

35:58.164 --> 36:01.082
Thank you, doctor.
You've been very helpful.

36:01.459 --> 36:02.917
You're welcome.

36:07.757 --> 36:10.175
I'm too old for this shit.

36:12.928 --> 36:14.095
You hungry?

36:14.430 --> 36:16.097
No! I'm not hungry.

36:16.640 --> 36:19.100
- Want me to drive?
- No! I'll drive!

36:19.435 --> 36:20.518
Get in that side!

36:20.770 --> 36:22.103
You drive.

36:29.153 --> 36:33.782
You get a bad personal call? What
is it? Did the stock market crash?

36:34.408 --> 36:36.659
Don't worry. Here, have a French fry.

36:43.125 --> 36:47.295
Fifty years old. What a birthday.
Fifty years old!

36:47.630 --> 36:52.342
Been on the force 20 years, not
a scratch on me. Got a wife, kids...

36:52.802 --> 36:57.680
...house, boat. I can kiss it all
goodbye because of your death wish.

36:57.932 --> 36:58.973
My life is over.

36:59.141 --> 37:00.809
Would you just shut up here!

37:01.018 --> 37:03.978
Why are you talking to me anyway?
I'm a dead man!

37:05.689 --> 37:09.442
I was driving before you were
an itch in your daddy's pants.

37:14.031 --> 37:15.740
- I didn't know that.
- Know what?

37:15.991 --> 37:18.076
That it was your birthday today.

37:18.994 --> 37:20.829
It was yesterday.

37:21.330 --> 37:24.207
Well, happy birthday for yesterday.

37:27.378 --> 37:29.504
Sincerely. Happy birthday, man.

37:29.713 --> 37:30.839
Thanks.

37:33.509 --> 37:37.345
Maybe we'll stay alive long enough
for me to buy you a present.

37:39.682 --> 37:41.349
Don't thank me now.

37:41.684 --> 37:45.687
It's the least I can do after
all the kindness you've shown me.

37:58.284 --> 38:00.910
Are you gonna tell me
where we're going?

38:01.787 --> 38:03.121
Are we together on this?

38:04.248 --> 38:08.626
Beverly Hills. We got an address
on Amanda Hunsaker's meal ticket.

38:08.878 --> 38:11.296
Remember, he's not a suspect yet.

38:11.630 --> 38:14.048
So we question him, not damage him.

38:14.258 --> 38:16.801
I won't hurt. You do all the talking.

38:17.052 --> 38:18.511
Let me do all the talking.

38:18.721 --> 38:20.722
Experience counts here.

38:23.392 --> 38:26.394
- You're not going to smoke in the car.
- Well, I am.

38:28.022 --> 38:31.232
- What? Does this bother you?
- It bothers me.

38:31.400 --> 38:32.817
- Does it?
- Yeah.

38:34.570 --> 38:36.070
I'll open a window.

38:36.447 --> 38:41.409
That's not the point. I have to watch
out for my lungs, take care of myself.

38:42.369 --> 38:44.579
4241 coming up.

38:44.830 --> 38:46.247
Bingo.

38:47.416 --> 38:51.419
- Do we have a warrant?
- We don't need one with the gate club.

38:51.921 --> 38:53.922
Didn't take them long, huh?

38:58.010 --> 39:00.803
Hey, guys, go on in!
Make yourselves at home!

39:01.180 --> 39:02.430
Merry Christmas!

39:04.934 --> 39:07.310
Don't need a warrant with an invitation.

39:09.063 --> 39:12.524
I saw this place on
"Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless."

39:22.409 --> 39:23.826
Get the door.

39:35.756 --> 39:37.757
Nice and easy.

39:40.594 --> 39:43.888
- Looks like the Garden of Eden.
- Look at this!

39:45.224 --> 39:46.641
Paradise.

39:49.937 --> 39:51.646
Isn't that sweet?

39:51.855 --> 39:54.232
I'm thinking probable cause.

40:06.745 --> 40:08.371
Get the girls!

40:09.665 --> 40:11.124
Okay, asshole!

40:11.667 --> 40:13.459
Move! Come on! Get out!

40:13.669 --> 40:15.503
Fast! Move!

40:16.797 --> 40:19.507
Get your hands on that tree
and face each other!

40:19.967 --> 40:21.426
Hands in front of you!

40:21.677 --> 40:24.762
- My leg...
- Don't move it, or I'll break your arm.

40:25.973 --> 40:26.973
Got them!

40:30.102 --> 40:31.644
Show me your hands!

40:32.021 --> 40:33.479
Right now!

40:34.106 --> 40:35.940
Put your hands out there!

40:40.863 --> 40:42.155
See how easy that was?

40:42.406 --> 40:45.908
Boom! Still alive.
Now we question him. You know why?

40:46.201 --> 40:49.537
Because I didn't shoot him
or jump off a building with him.

40:49.705 --> 40:51.205
The building guy lived.

40:51.415 --> 40:53.041
The point being, no killing.

40:53.417 --> 40:55.501
- No killing, right.
- Right.

40:55.711 --> 40:57.712
Piece of cake. Now I'm happy.

40:58.005 --> 41:00.673
Read him his rights.
I'll stand here being happy.

41:03.218 --> 41:04.302
He's got a gun!

41:48.097 --> 41:50.723
You ever met anybody you didn't kill?

41:53.894 --> 41:56.229
Well, I haven't killed you yet.

41:58.607 --> 42:00.233
Don't do me no favors.

42:00.609 --> 42:02.110
Don't you worry.

42:14.123 --> 42:17.792
The coroner gave the body
a ride downtown.

42:19.920 --> 42:21.921
I guess we can get out of here.

42:26.969 --> 42:29.429
I'm sorry about that shit
I said out there.

42:31.432 --> 42:34.100
You saved my life. Thank you.

42:40.441 --> 42:41.899
I bet that hurt to say.

42:44.445 --> 42:45.653
You'll never know.

42:47.781 --> 42:49.240
Let's get a bite to eat.

42:49.491 --> 42:50.825
Get my shoes on.

43:01.795 --> 43:04.547
- Mom, Rog is coming.
- Okay, Carrie.

43:13.682 --> 43:17.685
Here's my welcoming committee!
Where's my daughter? Which one...?

43:17.936 --> 43:21.314
- Come on, Daddy.
- This one's my daughter!

43:22.191 --> 43:24.484
Home, both of you. Dinnertime.

43:25.152 --> 43:26.486
How are you doing?

43:26.820 --> 43:28.362
I am doing all right.

43:28.655 --> 43:30.364
Is that a crook?

43:30.824 --> 43:33.367
No, this is my new partner, Martin.

43:37.206 --> 43:39.499
I'm glad you're home at a sensible hour.

43:39.792 --> 43:42.502
Well, I try to be a sensible dad.

43:42.878 --> 43:44.504
Come on in, Martin.

43:45.339 --> 43:47.340
Yeah, close the door.

43:47.883 --> 43:51.886
Hello, Nick. Get your legs
off the arm of the couch.

43:53.639 --> 43:57.558
How you doing? Is Mommy
in the kitchen? Let's sneak up on her.

44:02.815 --> 44:05.733
Hello, baby!
I want you to meet...

44:06.026 --> 44:08.820
I'd like you to meet
Daddy's new partner.

44:09.071 --> 44:10.655
- Martin Riggs.
- How are you?

44:10.906 --> 44:13.866
- This is my wife, Trish.
- Pleased to meet you.

44:14.159 --> 44:16.244
Martin's going to join us for dinner.

44:16.537 --> 44:19.205
- Roast okay with you?
- What's for dinner?

44:19.873 --> 44:22.208
We'll see what's for dinner.

44:23.043 --> 44:25.878
This is a brown, sticky...

44:26.380 --> 44:27.755
It's roast.

44:28.048 --> 44:30.424
How about a brown, roast-like substance?

44:30.676 --> 44:33.553
- Roger, you're being an asshole.
- I try not to be.

44:33.887 --> 44:35.638
- Want a drink?
- What do you got?

44:35.848 --> 44:37.932
We have Canadian Mist...

44:38.767 --> 44:42.353
- You like Canadian Mist?
- Honey, it's in the back.

44:44.565 --> 44:47.900
How come we didn't have fish?
I thought we had fish tonight.

44:48.235 --> 44:49.777
Don't worry about the fish.

44:50.070 --> 44:52.071
Getting defensive...
Ever go fishing?

44:52.364 --> 44:55.283
Not since I was a kid.
I used to go spearfishing.

44:57.244 --> 44:58.619
All I caught was a cold.

45:01.081 --> 45:02.707
I got that boat out there.

45:03.041 --> 45:05.042
Rianne, get the dessert.

45:05.419 --> 45:08.629
Rianne! Your mother said
get the dessert.

45:08.797 --> 45:11.173
- Get the dessert. Get to it!
- Shut up.

45:12.259 --> 45:16.762
Catalina Island. Nothing exciting,
but I catch my allotment.

45:17.139 --> 45:21.475
You can catch a few things out there.
I caught my wife out there.

45:23.061 --> 45:24.687
Nice fishing out there.

45:24.980 --> 45:26.439
Mr. Riggs, care for a tart?

45:26.982 --> 45:28.649
Thank you, yes. Call me Martin.

45:30.485 --> 45:32.153
Mr. Riggs.

45:32.487 --> 45:33.779
Sit down.

45:34.990 --> 45:37.742
Rianne, it's not the first time
we've had company.

45:43.457 --> 45:47.293
My name is Carrie, I'm no fairy
My sister's cherry

45:47.628 --> 45:49.962
She's in love with a guy
named Martin...

45:51.340 --> 45:52.340
Nicholas!

45:52.507 --> 45:55.134
Come on. It was really good!

45:55.510 --> 45:57.803
Yeah, Dad! Why don't you try it?

45:58.263 --> 45:59.263
It was good.

46:01.850 --> 46:03.351
Yeah, there you go.

46:03.644 --> 46:06.103
I'm gonna find a partner
My name is Roger

46:06.480 --> 46:10.024
And I need to be modger
And a secret hodger

46:10.859 --> 46:12.276
You need some help.

46:12.527 --> 46:13.986
I am awful!

46:28.168 --> 46:31.879
Hey, sarge! Thanks for
taking out the garbage.

46:32.506 --> 46:35.341
But, honey, I'm entertaining our guest.

46:38.971 --> 46:40.346
What do you think?

46:41.056 --> 46:43.808
It's nice. You know
anything about boats?

46:44.059 --> 46:46.727
- I know what they cost.
- Can you sail this?

46:47.270 --> 46:49.981
What's wrong with you?
It's not a sailboat.

46:50.732 --> 46:52.024
That's what I thought.

46:52.359 --> 46:57.196
There's no trick. That's the front,
that's the back, water all around.

46:57.489 --> 47:00.157
Why you gotta make things
so complicated?

47:04.204 --> 47:07.999
I don't. Things get complicated
all by themselves.

47:08.417 --> 47:10.668
You mean
Amanda Hunsaker's murder, huh?

47:10.919 --> 47:12.920
Did I mention that? I didn't.

47:14.047 --> 47:16.048
Didn't have to.
I can read your mind.

47:17.926 --> 47:20.052
What's the matter with you?

47:20.721 --> 47:22.930
- Why is there a problem?
- There's no problem.

47:23.181 --> 47:25.391
You got one dead girl
and one dead guy.

47:25.600 --> 47:30.062
The guy kills the girl. We kill him
because he wants us to be dead guys.

47:30.439 --> 47:32.189
That's easy for you to say.

47:33.567 --> 47:35.443
A sugar daddy is dealing drugs.

47:35.694 --> 47:39.238
She said, did or saw something
she wasn't supposed to.

47:39.448 --> 47:42.742
He pitches her off the balcony
into the sweet by-and-by.

47:43.827 --> 47:46.120
That's why he came at us
with a shotgun today.

47:46.329 --> 47:50.416
I'm sorry. It's just a little too neat.
I can't swallow it.

47:50.751 --> 47:54.712
Of course it's neat.
What's wrong with neat? I like neat.

47:56.089 --> 47:58.466
By neat, you mean simple.

48:01.094 --> 48:02.762
- You okay?
- Watch out!

48:03.430 --> 48:04.930
What button did you push?

48:06.099 --> 48:07.808
Where's my manual?

48:09.269 --> 48:11.562
Is this what you're
looking for, captain?

48:11.813 --> 48:13.105
You asshole!

48:13.940 --> 48:17.777
Didn't mean to interrupt one of those
intellectual conversations...

48:18.612 --> 48:20.905
Mark asked me to a club tomorrow night.

48:21.156 --> 48:24.283
- You're grounded. You know that.
- Please, Daddy?

48:24.493 --> 48:25.618
Which one is Mark?

48:25.869 --> 48:28.245
- The blond one.
- With pits in his face?

48:28.789 --> 48:30.164
Those are dimples.

48:30.373 --> 48:34.376
Pits. When he smiles, I can see
through his head. The answer is no.

48:34.961 --> 48:36.170
Have a heart, Rog.

48:36.379 --> 48:39.924
Hey, buddy. She smoked pot
in the house. She's grounded.

48:40.133 --> 48:43.886
Why can I have a beer
and I can't smoke a joint?

48:44.096 --> 48:45.387
It's not coke, you know.

48:45.597 --> 48:49.475
I'll tell you why.
Because now, at this moment...

48:49.810 --> 48:52.978
...beer is legal, grass ain't.
Right or wrong?

48:53.396 --> 48:55.439
- It's wrong.
- Right.

49:01.530 --> 49:04.406
They sit there drinking six-packs
and I get grounded.

49:05.951 --> 49:07.618
I'm gonna go home.

49:08.328 --> 49:10.704
Did we resolve anything here tonight?

49:10.956 --> 49:12.873
Yeah, we resolved plenty.

49:14.042 --> 49:16.460
We know your wife
takes out the garbage...

49:16.795 --> 49:19.463
...your daughter smokes grass
and it's illegal...

49:20.841 --> 49:23.676
...and you don't know
a lot about boats.

49:28.056 --> 49:30.474
You got a hell of a nice family there.

49:30.725 --> 49:31.809
Thank you.

49:32.644 --> 49:34.687
I enjoyed the meal. Thanks a lot.

49:34.896 --> 49:38.190
Bullshit. But thanks anyway.

49:44.489 --> 49:46.323
You don't trust me at all, do you?

49:47.742 --> 49:52.538
I tell you what. You make it through
tomorrow without killing anybody...

49:52.747 --> 49:56.709
...especially me or yourself,
then I'll start trusting you.

49:59.004 --> 50:00.379
Fair enough.

50:05.510 --> 50:06.969
I do it real good, you know.

50:07.554 --> 50:08.596
Do what?

50:11.850 --> 50:16.061
When I was 19, I did a guy
in Laos from 1000 yards out.

50:16.521 --> 50:18.731
A rifle shot in high wind.

50:21.193 --> 50:22.693
Maybe eight...

50:23.236 --> 50:26.405
...or even ten guys in the world
could have made that shot.

50:30.952 --> 50:33.537
It's the only thing I was ever good at.

50:36.124 --> 50:37.249
See you tomorrow.

50:39.127 --> 50:40.794
Yeah, see you.

50:47.761 --> 50:49.803
You really like my wife's cooking?

50:56.394 --> 50:57.394
No.

50:58.563 --> 50:59.813
See you tomorrow.

51:25.257 --> 51:27.258
Get out of there, Burbank.

51:46.861 --> 51:48.821
This is cute.

51:52.617 --> 51:55.286
What have we got here?
"Police evidence."

53:33.259 --> 53:35.886
Morning, Roger.
Here, have some coffee.

53:36.429 --> 53:41.225
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about the night Amanda Hunsaker died.

53:41.559 --> 53:43.394
- How did you get in?
- Trish let me in.

53:43.645 --> 53:45.604
- What time is it?
- Daytime.

53:46.064 --> 53:48.732
The night Amanda Hunsaker died, she...

53:49.234 --> 53:52.236
What was the name of that hooker
who witnessed the jump?

53:52.445 --> 53:55.948
Come on, we got to get up
and catch bad guys today.

53:56.241 --> 53:57.741
I'll get a shower.

53:57.992 --> 54:00.786
What was the name of that hooker?

54:00.995 --> 54:04.331
- Century City isn't her usual turf.
- Her name is Dixie!

54:04.582 --> 54:08.419
Give me that cup.
And get out of here!

54:12.757 --> 54:15.801
Someone was in bed with Amanda
the night she died.

54:16.094 --> 54:18.262
Until now, we assumed it was a man.

54:18.596 --> 54:20.264
Suppose it was Dixie.

54:20.515 --> 54:24.726
Disgusting, but okay. Let's say Dixie
put the drain cleaner in her pills.

54:24.936 --> 54:26.437
Say someone paid her.

54:26.646 --> 54:31.525
She thinks, "Amanda swallows a couple
downers and she's dead." Then Dixie...

54:31.943 --> 54:33.068
If it was her.

54:33.236 --> 54:38.365
If it was her. She's got plenty of time
to spritz the place up and get out.

54:38.533 --> 54:40.617
But Amanda jumps out the window.

54:40.952 --> 54:42.828
Or Dixie pushes her.

54:43.037 --> 54:45.998
She has to make a quick exit
because the body's public.

54:46.207 --> 54:47.749
So she hauls ass downstairs.

54:47.959 --> 54:49.960
People are saying, "What happened?"

54:50.211 --> 54:52.546
Somebody spots her,
and she says, "Shit!"

54:52.964 --> 54:55.048
That's right, she says, "Shit!"

54:55.341 --> 54:58.343
The point being that now
she has to cover her ass.

55:00.305 --> 55:04.975
So she grabs a flatfoot and says,
"Officer, I saw the whole thing."

55:06.311 --> 55:07.644
Right.

55:11.483 --> 55:13.066
That's pretty fucking thin.

55:13.318 --> 55:14.568
That's very thin.

55:14.903 --> 55:16.570
Thin's my middle name.

55:16.821 --> 55:19.239
Your wife's cooking, I'm not surprised.

55:20.658 --> 55:22.242
- What?
- Nothing.

55:22.577 --> 55:25.329
Those remarks won't get you
invited to Christmas dinner.

55:26.414 --> 55:29.082
My luck's changing
for the better every day.

55:31.336 --> 55:33.837
All right, baby, come to Roger.

55:36.174 --> 55:37.674
Center mass.

55:43.848 --> 55:45.724
Read them and weep.

55:49.020 --> 55:51.230
Do you sleep with that thing?

55:51.731 --> 55:53.273
I would if I slept.

55:53.608 --> 55:56.777
Step back. Let me show
what an old man can do.

55:57.695 --> 55:59.905
Just warming up,
just warming up.

56:07.539 --> 56:09.122
Watch carefully.

56:22.720 --> 56:26.223
Hey! Look at that, will you?
Not bad for an old man.

56:26.724 --> 56:28.892
Step aside, old man.

57:25.033 --> 57:26.867
Have a nice day.

57:32.540 --> 57:33.999
Shit!

57:37.712 --> 57:40.380
The policemen are here!

57:41.049 --> 57:44.384
Yeah, you're right.
Hello, policemen!

57:49.557 --> 57:51.475
- How you doing?
- Fine.

57:51.684 --> 57:54.353
Are you going to bust Dixie?

57:54.604 --> 57:57.397
We're just going over there
for a cup of coffee.

57:57.607 --> 57:59.775
We're going over here to have breakfast.

58:00.026 --> 58:04.988
You're gonna bust Dixie!

58:10.370 --> 58:13.538
- Like I said, thin.
- Probably nothing.

58:26.511 --> 58:28.929
Did you see that? Wasn't that great?

58:32.600 --> 58:34.101
What are you, a fag?

58:34.310 --> 58:36.019
Your coat's on fire!

58:40.400 --> 58:43.735
- Probably nothing.
- Thin. Very thin.

58:45.947 --> 58:48.740
You guys okay? Got all
your fingers and toes?

58:48.991 --> 58:51.118
Three William 56.

58:51.411 --> 58:54.329
We got a fire and explosion
at 111th and Larch.

58:54.622 --> 58:57.499
Request ambulance and fire department.

58:57.959 --> 59:00.293
Do it again! Do it again!

59:00.628 --> 59:03.505
- Give me a break, guys.
- Enough, enough!

59:03.798 --> 59:06.049
Do you think Dixie was home?

59:17.103 --> 59:18.478
What you got?

59:19.689 --> 59:21.064
Part of the device.

59:21.357 --> 59:23.817
This is artwork.
This is goddamn artwork.

59:24.026 --> 59:29.156
This is real pro stuff. I haven't seen
anything like this since the war.

59:30.616 --> 59:33.994
The CIA used to hire mercs.
They used the exact same setup.

59:34.245 --> 59:37.164
Mercury switches, gaflooey!
That's heavy shit.

59:38.750 --> 59:41.710
We got something.
The detective wants to see you.

59:51.888 --> 59:52.971
Okay, here it is.

59:53.222 --> 59:54.973
Some kids playing this morning...

59:55.183 --> 59:57.309
...one saw a guy checking the meter.

59:57.560 --> 59:59.686
- Where?
- Here at Dixie's.

59:59.937 --> 01:00:04.274
He was playing under the porch.
Says he saw the guy pretty good.

01:00:04.525 --> 01:00:07.986
- It could be a break.
- Those kids are six years old.

01:00:08.196 --> 01:00:10.697
- You call the gas company?
- Sure did.

01:00:11.032 --> 01:00:14.659
No one's supposed to check
that meter for at least a month.

01:00:16.037 --> 01:00:19.080
- Let me handle this.
- Be my guest.

01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:21.750
He's the little fellow that saw the guy.

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:25.754
My name is Detective Murtaugh.
What's yours?

01:00:25.963 --> 01:00:29.299
- Don't tell him your name.
- He'll put you in jail.

01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:30.801
You won't see your mom.

01:00:31.093 --> 01:00:34.930
It's all right. I won't
put you in jail. What's your name?

01:00:35.139 --> 01:00:38.266
- Don't tell him, Alfred.
- Alfred!

01:00:38.726 --> 01:00:42.062
This is Alfred! Hey, meet Alfred.
This is Alfred.

01:00:42.313 --> 01:00:44.940
Alfred, hi! How old are you?

01:00:45.316 --> 01:00:46.483
Six.

01:00:46.859 --> 01:00:50.487
Six years old. I bet you like Go-Bots.

01:00:50.696 --> 01:00:52.113
Is that a real gun?

01:00:52.573 --> 01:00:54.533
Yeah, this is a real gun.

01:00:54.992 --> 01:00:56.159
Do you kill people?

01:00:56.452 --> 01:01:00.747
No. If some guy is hurting someone,
I try to shoot him in the leg...

01:01:00.998 --> 01:01:02.374
...just to stop him.

01:01:02.583 --> 01:01:05.126
Mama says policemen shoot black people.

01:01:05.378 --> 01:01:07.295
- Is it true?
- Yeah, is it true?

01:01:07.505 --> 01:01:09.297
Is that true?

01:01:11.926 --> 01:01:14.177
Maybe we ought to get
the kids some...

01:01:14.595 --> 01:01:15.762
Ice cream.

01:01:16.222 --> 01:01:17.264
You like ice cream?

01:01:23.771 --> 01:01:26.398
No, not you, Alfred.

01:01:30.611 --> 01:01:33.947
The man you saw,
did you get a good look at him?

01:01:34.198 --> 01:01:36.491
- I saw him.
- Great!

01:01:37.159 --> 01:01:41.413
Picture him in your head.
Close your eyes.

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:44.249
Think what he looks like.

01:01:44.584 --> 01:01:45.709
Got it?

01:01:46.168 --> 01:01:47.627
Can you draw him?

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:52.132
Give me some drawing paper
and crayons.

01:01:52.592 --> 01:01:54.885
- This is good.
- Can it, man.

01:01:55.136 --> 01:01:57.470
We're gonna put out
an APB on Big Bird.

01:01:57.847 --> 01:02:00.640
"All units. Large
yellow bird, silly voice."

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:03.852
You're hilarious, Martin. It's enough.

01:02:04.061 --> 01:02:05.812
Tell me what he looks like.

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:08.106
Was he black?

01:02:09.317 --> 01:02:10.358
Was he white?

01:02:13.404 --> 01:02:15.238
Was he tall?

01:02:15.573 --> 01:02:17.115
Tall like me?

01:02:17.325 --> 01:02:19.409
What color was his hair? Brown?

01:02:20.661 --> 01:02:22.120
Black?

01:02:22.663 --> 01:02:24.122
Blond?

01:02:24.332 --> 01:02:25.832
His hair was blond.

01:02:26.959 --> 01:02:30.378
What did he have on?
Did he have jeans on?

01:02:30.588 --> 01:02:31.838
It was paint.

01:02:32.089 --> 01:02:33.340
Pained?

01:02:34.008 --> 01:02:35.008
I don't know.

01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:38.470
Painted?

01:02:39.805 --> 01:02:41.681
Painted. A tattoo?

01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:46.603
Like Popeye?
A tattoo like Popeye? No?

01:02:47.688 --> 01:02:48.855
It was that.

01:02:51.359 --> 01:02:52.817
Like that?

01:02:53.486 --> 01:02:54.986
Exactly like that?

01:02:56.656 --> 01:02:58.949
I saw it good. This is it.

01:02:59.158 --> 01:03:00.533
I remember.

01:03:00.993 --> 01:03:02.285
Are you sure?

01:03:02.828 --> 01:03:04.120
It had a knife, even.

01:03:15.675 --> 01:03:18.677
Roger, that's a Special Forces tattoo.

01:03:19.512 --> 01:03:20.679
Really?

01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:25.850
A Special Forces tattoo,
mercury switches...

01:03:29.855 --> 01:03:32.440
What the hell
have we gotten into here?

01:03:35.361 --> 01:03:38.697
Wonder if there's an opening
in the fire department?

01:03:48.916 --> 01:03:50.125
Want to tell me about it?

01:03:50.584 --> 01:03:52.961
- About what?
- Don't bullshit me.

01:03:53.212 --> 01:03:56.631
Your daughter wasn't killed
for something she was into.

01:03:56.882 --> 01:03:59.092
She was killed
for something you're into.

01:04:00.845 --> 01:04:02.053
Stop me if I'm wrong.

01:04:03.389 --> 01:04:05.432
I don't know what you mean.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.561
Keep your hands
away from your pocket, okay?

01:04:10.187 --> 01:04:12.063
- Easy, man.
- Fuck easy.

01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:18.528
You called me the other day
to blow the whistle, right?

01:04:19.238 --> 01:04:20.822
Blow the whistle on what?

01:04:21.032 --> 01:04:24.325
You were going to tell all,
so they killed your daughter.

01:04:24.577 --> 01:04:27.245
Tell me if I'm wrong.
Talk to me!

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:29.748
They killed your daughter.

01:04:30.041 --> 01:04:33.126
They paid off a hooker to poison
your little girl.

01:04:33.377 --> 01:04:35.420
Chrissake!
I've got another daughter.

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:38.965
- She'll be protected.
- You don't know these people.

01:04:39.467 --> 01:04:41.259
Acquaint me with them.

01:04:44.805 --> 01:04:46.514
It goes back to the war.

01:04:49.727 --> 01:04:53.980
I worked with a group called
"Air America." CIA front.

01:04:56.275 --> 01:04:58.902
They secretly ran
the entire war out of Laos.

01:04:59.612 --> 01:05:03.782
I was with a special unit called
"Shadow Company." Trained killers.

01:05:04.116 --> 01:05:07.619
When Charlie brought in heroin
to finance the VC government...

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:10.663
...Shadow Company burned
the whole thing down.

01:05:11.123 --> 01:05:12.957
We killed everybody.

01:05:18.005 --> 01:05:19.756
We also formed a plan.

01:05:20.174 --> 01:05:21.299
Keep talking.

01:05:27.515 --> 01:05:30.892
A few years ago, Shadow Company
got together again.

01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:32.977
The war was over.

01:05:33.979 --> 01:05:36.606
But we still had our sources in Asia.

01:05:37.858 --> 01:05:39.901
We've been bringing it in
ever since.

01:05:40.277 --> 01:05:41.569
Bringing in what?

01:05:42.655 --> 01:05:44.030
Heroin.

01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:46.741
Two major shipments a year.

01:05:50.162 --> 01:05:52.539
It's all run by ex-CIA.

01:05:53.332 --> 01:05:55.333
Soldiers, mercs.

01:05:56.168 --> 01:05:58.253
You son of a bitch!

01:05:58.462 --> 01:06:02.382
If you had cold feet, why did
they kill Amanda? Why not you?

01:06:02.591 --> 01:06:05.009
- They can't. They need me.
- Why?

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:10.306
My company is a perfect front. Makes
everything look great on tax reports.

01:06:14.019 --> 01:06:16.354
This is big business, Roger.

01:06:21.193 --> 01:06:22.735
Not anymore.

01:06:23.863 --> 01:06:25.864
I'm gonna burn it down.

01:06:26.073 --> 01:06:27.907
You can't. It's too big.

01:06:28.492 --> 01:06:31.494
These people are trained,
expert killers.

01:06:31.996 --> 01:06:36.124
Tell me about your next shipment:
Where it's coming in, how many...

01:06:36.333 --> 01:06:39.043
I can't tell you that, Roger.
I can't.

01:06:39.712 --> 01:06:44.340
I have another daughter. You can't
protect her. I'm in this too deep.

01:07:03.611 --> 01:07:07.238
Heroin.
You got off easy, you son of a bitch!

01:07:27.927 --> 01:07:29.093
You through?

01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:31.262
I haven't even started.

01:07:31.764 --> 01:07:36.100
Gen. McAllister, this is Delta One.
We're coming in. Over.

01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:39.229
- So your mission is accomplished?
- Yes, sir.

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.648
Mr. Hunsaker is dead, sir.

01:07:41.941 --> 01:07:44.817
I'm afraid, however,
that another problem exists.

01:07:45.069 --> 01:07:46.653
What is it? Explain.

01:07:46.904 --> 01:07:48.905
Hunsaker spoke to the police.

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:52.492
- Are they dead?
- No, I missed the opportunity.

01:07:52.743 --> 01:07:56.621
Very disappointing. So the police
may know the whole operation?

01:07:56.830 --> 01:07:58.498
That is correct, sir.

01:07:59.124 --> 01:08:01.501
Joshua, it's time
we turned up the heat.

01:08:01.752 --> 01:08:03.169
Come on home.

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:24.399
What's a nice Irish girl
like you doing out here?

01:08:24.608 --> 01:08:27.694
I'm looking for a guy,
had this girl in his stable.

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:30.988
- Never seen her.
- She's in your line of work. You sure?

01:08:31.282 --> 01:08:33.783
- Sure. Why?
- I'm a police officer.

01:08:33.993 --> 01:08:36.661
Don't worry, I won't drag your
ass to jail...

01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:05.564
You wore your vest!

01:09:06.649 --> 01:09:08.984
That was smart, kid. Come on.

01:09:11.196 --> 01:09:13.531
Hold on! I'm on your side.

01:09:16.201 --> 01:09:18.618
Son of a bitch, that hurts!

01:09:19.287 --> 01:09:21.747
I'm pissed, Roger! Now I'm pissed.

01:09:23.584 --> 01:09:25.001
Look at your face!

01:09:25.336 --> 01:09:27.462
Two inches higher,
he'd have hit your head.

01:09:27.671 --> 01:09:30.256
Two inches lower,
I'd be a falsetto for life.

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:32.383
I bet you'd sound nice too.

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:36.136
- Where's my gun?
- Here.

01:09:39.224 --> 01:09:40.933
Oh, shit! Roger!

01:09:41.769 --> 01:09:43.810
The guy who shot me...

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:47.982
The same albino jackrabbit
son of a bitch that did Hunsaker.

01:09:48.192 --> 01:09:49.901
- You sure?
- I'm sure, man.

01:09:50.069 --> 01:09:52.028
I never forget an asshole.

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:53.946
I got an idea.

01:09:54.698 --> 01:09:58.326
We fly first class to Detroit
and lay low for a couple weeks.

01:09:58.535 --> 01:10:00.912
Come on, be serious.
What do we do?

01:10:01.121 --> 01:10:02.246
What else?

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:05.166
We bury the fuckers.
And you know what else?

01:10:05.376 --> 01:10:09.504
We do this right, we get famous.
Do shaving ads. Girls. Money.

01:10:10.297 --> 01:10:12.965
With our luck, we'll do
Forest Lawn commercials.

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:15.468
Bullshit! We got the edge.

01:10:16.553 --> 01:10:20.181
Roger, they think I'm dead.
I'm a corpse.

01:10:26.438 --> 01:10:27.855
Brilliant.

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:31.651
Brilliant shit!

01:10:34.613 --> 01:10:36.322
We got a body for you.

01:10:36.573 --> 01:10:40.118
He was at Hunsaker's place.
I saw him, he saw me.

01:10:40.327 --> 01:10:42.328
Get someone else to do it, okay?

01:10:42.663 --> 01:10:46.791
Captain says give it to you.
About two blocks from your house.

01:10:47.292 --> 01:10:51.003
Yeah, sure. He's probably blond
with big dimples.

01:10:51.338 --> 01:10:53.673
How did you know that, sarge?

01:10:55.467 --> 01:10:56.467
Get in here!

01:10:57.970 --> 01:10:59.011
Trouble.

01:11:02.349 --> 01:11:06.227
They just gave a description
of the kid my daughter's dating.

01:11:33.714 --> 01:11:35.882
Let's be dark and quiet.

01:12:17.216 --> 01:12:19.425
The bastards got my daughter.

01:12:30.896 --> 01:12:31.938
What is it?

01:12:32.439 --> 01:12:33.439
Nothing.

01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:35.191
- What is it?!
- Nothing!

01:12:35.442 --> 01:12:38.194
Get back in your room.
Back in your room!

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:57.463
You have a beautiful daughter.

01:12:57.673 --> 01:13:01.133
I'd stick by the phone to find out
Where to meet us.

01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:08.891
They got my kid.

01:13:10.644 --> 01:13:12.728
Bastards took my baby.

01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:38.838
Sgt. McCaskey, pick up line three.

01:13:39.673 --> 01:13:41.424
Homicide, McCaskey speaking.

01:13:41.633 --> 01:13:42.967
This is KCOP news.

01:13:43.176 --> 01:13:47.555
We heard an officer was shot tonight.
Can you give us more information?

01:13:47.806 --> 01:13:51.559
Sgt. Martin Riggs was shot and killed.
Who is this?

01:13:51.768 --> 01:13:53.728
We'll send somebody right over.

01:13:58.233 --> 01:14:00.776
Bingo! Riggs is out of the picture.

01:14:01.194 --> 01:14:02.945
I want Murtaugh taken alive.

01:14:03.488 --> 01:14:04.947
He may not talk.

01:14:06.199 --> 01:14:08.117
We have his little girl.
He'll talk.

01:14:24.217 --> 01:14:27.053
You know they're gonna kill her,
don't you?

01:14:30.349 --> 01:14:34.769
And if you want her back,
you'll have to take her away from them.

01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:36.395
I know.

01:14:41.818 --> 01:14:45.738
We do this my way.
You shoot and you shoot to kill.

01:14:46.239 --> 01:14:50.701
Get as many as you can.
All you got to do is just not miss.

01:14:50.911 --> 01:14:52.453
I won't miss.

01:14:54.456 --> 01:14:57.375
We're going to get bloody on this one.

01:15:01.546 --> 01:15:03.255
Are you really crazy?

01:15:06.009 --> 01:15:08.302
Or are you as good
as you say you are?

01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:12.306
You're gonna have to trust me.

01:15:16.311 --> 01:15:17.645
Here we go.

01:15:24.361 --> 01:15:28.614
We don't want your daughter.
We want to know what Hunsaker told you.

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:32.868
Dry lake. Victorville.
Sunrise tomorroW. Be there.

01:18:38.096 --> 01:18:39.430
Murtaugh!

01:18:40.056 --> 01:18:41.473
Yes, that's right.

01:18:41.725 --> 01:18:43.684
Show me my daughter!

01:18:43.977 --> 01:18:46.812
Let me see her, then I'll come quietly.

01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:55.487
He wants to see the girl.

01:18:55.697 --> 01:18:56.947
Get out.

01:19:02.579 --> 01:19:03.829
Daddy!

01:19:04.331 --> 01:19:06.665
Okay, baby! I'm here.

01:19:07.167 --> 01:19:09.084
Okay, it's all right.

01:19:09.336 --> 01:19:10.336
Simple exchange.

01:19:11.338 --> 01:19:14.924
You come with us,
the girl takes a walk.

01:19:15.175 --> 01:19:16.634
Let her go now.

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:22.473
As I say, take your hands
out of your pockets.

01:19:22.682 --> 01:19:24.350
Sure thing, pal.

01:19:28.188 --> 01:19:29.188
It's alive.

01:19:31.691 --> 01:19:34.318
Let her go now, or we all die.

01:19:35.153 --> 01:19:36.236
Take him!

01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:37.821
He has a grenade!

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:41.033
He's bluffing!
He wouldn't risk killing his daughter.

01:19:41.826 --> 01:19:43.369
If she's gonna die...

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:47.039
...she's gonna die with me.
My way, not yours.

01:19:52.212 --> 01:19:56.590
Come on, Roger, get out of the way.
Move to your left. Come on!

01:19:56.841 --> 01:19:58.300
Put the pin back in.

01:19:58.802 --> 01:20:02.638
Officer Murtaugh, don't be foolish.
Look at the hardware.

01:20:02.973 --> 01:20:04.598
Move to your left.

01:20:10.271 --> 01:20:13.774
Look at the firepower.
You're grounded. Riggs is gone.

01:20:14.150 --> 01:20:16.318
Put the pin back in the grenade.

01:20:16.528 --> 01:20:18.112
If you come closer...

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:19.905
...then we all die.

01:20:21.449 --> 01:20:23.117
I don't think so.

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:32.918
Come on, honey.

01:20:35.005 --> 01:20:36.005
Just a smoker.

01:20:36.256 --> 01:20:37.464
Bingo.

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:44.555
- Where is he?
- It's Riggs.

01:20:46.975 --> 01:20:49.309
Rianne, get in the car!

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:52.688
Get in the fucking car!

01:21:10.665 --> 01:21:12.166
Go, Rianne, go!

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:15.252
Come on, cottontail,
stick your head up.

01:21:16.713 --> 01:21:19.214
That's it, you son of a bitch.
Good night.

01:21:22.886 --> 01:21:25.596
Don't try it, son.
You're not that fast.

01:21:27.599 --> 01:21:29.433
Hello, Joshua. Hello, Joshua.

01:21:29.642 --> 01:21:31.393
- Yes, sir.
- I got Riggs.

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:34.897
He's got Riggs. Go get the girl!

01:22:10.308 --> 01:22:12.309
Throw your weapon down!

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.895
Put your hands behind your head!

01:22:18.983 --> 01:22:22.653
You're Gen. Peter McAllister,
commander of Shadow Company.

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:25.739
I see we've heard of each other.

01:22:25.949 --> 01:22:29.493
Yep. It'll almost be a shame
when I nail you.

01:22:30.411 --> 01:22:34.748
I ran into some of those Shadow Company
pussies in Saigon in '69.

01:22:35.041 --> 01:22:36.333
You did, did you?

01:23:23.464 --> 01:23:25.299
Leave me alone!

01:23:52.035 --> 01:23:54.328
Save your strength.
You'll need it.

01:23:54.746 --> 01:23:55.746
Who's the Chin?

01:23:56.915 --> 01:23:59.499
Endo, meet Mr. Martin Riggs.

01:24:00.627 --> 01:24:03.587
Endo has forgotten more
about dispensing pain...

01:24:03.796 --> 01:24:05.047
...than we'll ever know.

01:24:06.925 --> 01:24:08.675
See, we have a problem.

01:24:08.885 --> 01:24:10.677
Since we have Murtaugh...

01:24:11.221 --> 01:24:12.512
...we don't need you.

01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:16.225
- I believe in being thorough.
- I've heard that about you.

01:24:18.436 --> 01:24:21.104
Our problem, and yours too...

01:24:21.856 --> 01:24:24.858
...is we have a shipment
of merchandise to deliver.

01:24:25.068 --> 01:24:26.944
Why don't you just call it heroin?

01:24:28.613 --> 01:24:30.989
It's rather large, this shipment.

01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:33.867
It would be unfortunate...

01:24:34.077 --> 01:24:36.828
...if we showed up
to deliver our heroin...

01:24:37.497 --> 01:24:39.248
...and were surrounded by 50 cops.

01:24:39.457 --> 01:24:40.666
That would be too bad.

01:24:40.917 --> 01:24:42.459
Yes, it would be.

01:24:43.419 --> 01:24:46.338
So we have to find out
all the cops know.

01:24:46.547 --> 01:24:49.508
We don't know shit.
You did Hunsaker before he could say...

01:24:51.886 --> 01:24:55.430
I wish I could believe you.
Unfortunately, I don't.

01:25:00.561 --> 01:25:03.438
Now, if you tell me
everything you know...

01:25:03.690 --> 01:25:05.983
...I promise you I'll kill you quick.

01:25:08.152 --> 01:25:09.903
I told you everything I know.

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:18.620
What is that thing?

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:21.915
I'll tell you.

01:25:22.875 --> 01:25:24.918
It's electric shock treatment.

01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:30.007
We're in for a long night,
because I don't know shit.

01:25:32.343 --> 01:25:33.719
We'll see.

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:43.437
Hit him again!

01:25:53.406 --> 01:25:54.406
Again!

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:01.330
Tell me about the shipment!

01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:06.293
I'm gonna fucking kill both of you!

01:26:06.544 --> 01:26:08.920
Very funny.
What about the shipment?

01:26:14.594 --> 01:26:16.678
The shipment, Mr. Murtaugh.

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:18.972
Go spit!

01:26:20.266 --> 01:26:21.266
Salt.

01:26:36.741 --> 01:26:40.577
Go spit, you son of a bitch.
Fuck you!

01:26:41.412 --> 01:26:43.038
This is getting nowhere.

01:26:43.247 --> 01:26:44.414
Mr. Large.

01:26:51.672 --> 01:26:53.006
He knows shit. We're safe.

01:26:53.216 --> 01:26:56.093
He'd have told us.
Nobody can take that.

01:26:56.803 --> 01:26:58.136
Fine.

01:26:58.346 --> 01:26:59.763
Badass soldier, huh?

01:27:14.404 --> 01:27:15.570
Get her up.

01:27:20.701 --> 01:27:23.370
Untie me and I'll kill
all of you bastards!

01:27:23.579 --> 01:27:25.330
Tell me what you know.

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:28.250
Fuck you, bastard!
I'll kill you!

01:27:35.716 --> 01:27:37.509
Sorry, pal.
Say good night.

01:27:59.365 --> 01:28:02.617
That's a real good-looking
young woman...

01:28:02.827 --> 01:28:05.203
...you got there, Mr. Murtaugh.

01:28:08.124 --> 01:28:09.332
I've told you everything.

01:28:09.542 --> 01:28:11.042
We'll soon know, won't we?

01:28:11.252 --> 01:28:12.836
I'm warning you.

01:28:13.212 --> 01:28:14.212
Don't.

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:16.798
Spare me, son. It's over.

01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:19.759
There's no more heroes
left in the world.

01:28:25.224 --> 01:28:26.475
Kill that son of a bitch!

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:39.613
That asshole's getting away!

01:28:39.864 --> 01:28:41.865
Who's fucking next?

01:28:42.325 --> 01:28:43.867
McAllister!

01:28:44.118 --> 01:28:45.285
Who's next?

01:28:48.372 --> 01:28:49.956
Pretty thin, huh?

01:28:50.208 --> 01:28:51.666
Anorexic.

01:28:59.175 --> 01:29:01.468
- Let's do what the shepherd did.
- What?

01:29:01.677 --> 01:29:03.470
Get the flock out of here.

01:29:15.399 --> 01:29:16.775
Is it him?

01:29:17.109 --> 01:29:19.236
No. It's not Joshua.

01:30:36.147 --> 01:30:37.981
Halt! Stop! Stop!

01:30:38.190 --> 01:30:40.942
Get out of the fucking car!
Come on, now!

01:30:43.779 --> 01:30:44.863
Police officers!

01:31:01.422 --> 01:31:06.343
I'm a police officer. Give me
some backup and take care of the girl.

01:31:36.415 --> 01:31:39.334
- He's going for the freeway!
- You okay?

01:31:43.839 --> 01:31:47.842
Cut over the 3rd Street bridge!
You'll get ahead of him.

01:31:50.971 --> 01:31:52.806
General McAllister...

01:31:54.475 --> 01:31:56.518
...time for you to die.

01:32:44.942 --> 01:32:46.109
Hold it!

01:33:08.841 --> 01:33:10.592
Get back in your car!

01:33:32.698 --> 01:33:34.824
Mind if I test-drive your Audi?

01:33:38.454 --> 01:33:40.663
Stop the son of a bitch!

01:33:45.711 --> 01:33:46.711
Shit!

01:33:48.798 --> 01:33:50.131
He got my car!

01:33:52.968 --> 01:33:55.053
- Get back!
- Hey, man, I'm cool.

01:34:06.190 --> 01:34:07.816
Let's get out of here!

01:34:11.779 --> 01:34:12.779
Open the door!

01:34:22.873 --> 01:34:25.166
Kill that cop son of a bitch!

01:34:27.586 --> 01:34:30.004
No way you live. No way.

01:35:56.091 --> 01:35:58.259
- Gangway!
- Hold it now.

01:35:58.510 --> 01:36:00.637
- Police officer.
- Go ahead.

01:36:06.101 --> 01:36:08.895
Well, shit!
What now, kid?

01:36:09.521 --> 01:36:12.148
First thing, we get you to hospital.

01:36:12.691 --> 01:36:14.359
Come on. Let's go.

01:36:15.402 --> 01:36:18.196
Don't breathe this stuff.
You'll see pink elephants.

01:36:18.447 --> 01:36:20.406
The slippery son of a bitch got away!

01:36:20.658 --> 01:36:23.326
- What do you mean he got away?
- Hey, fire me.

01:36:26.497 --> 01:36:27.664
Where you going?

01:36:27.998 --> 01:36:29.874
Sarge, I'm commandeering your car.

01:36:30.125 --> 01:36:31.417
What's the matter?

01:36:31.627 --> 01:36:34.212
My home!
The bastard knows where I live.

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:36.297
I'll drive, Cochise.

01:36:37.341 --> 01:36:40.009
- I got to look at him!
- He's all right.

01:36:43.389 --> 01:36:46.140
3-W-30 en route to
Sgt. Murtaugh's residence.

01:36:46.392 --> 01:36:48.685
Requesting additional units.

01:37:22.469 --> 01:37:24.303
Excuse me, sir.
May we help you?

01:37:24.805 --> 01:37:25.805
No, thank you.

01:37:53.167 --> 01:37:55.043
Good morning, sir.

01:37:56.253 --> 01:37:58.421
Tell me, what day is it?

01:37:59.798 --> 01:38:01.466
Goddamn Christmas!

01:38:03.010 --> 01:38:05.470
I'll give you a home
to come back to.

01:38:23.572 --> 01:38:25.782
Crazy son of a bitch!

01:38:45.344 --> 01:38:46.969
Give me that. Drop it.

01:38:56.688 --> 01:38:58.189
Looking for the general?

01:38:59.650 --> 01:39:03.486
He's barbecuing his nuts
on Hollywood Boulevard.

01:39:11.245 --> 01:39:13.079
What do you say, Jack?

01:39:14.081 --> 01:39:15.832
Like a shot at the title?

01:39:16.834 --> 01:39:18.501
Don't mind if I do.

01:39:35.185 --> 01:39:39.605
Okay, men! I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.
My responsibility here!

01:39:40.399 --> 01:39:42.066
Watch commander is en route.

01:39:42.317 --> 01:39:45.778
Until then, Sgt. Murtaugh
is in charge on site.

01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:52.034
Just keep the citizens clear.

01:40:04.006 --> 01:40:05.756
Keep everyone back!

01:40:14.016 --> 01:40:16.976
It's Sgt. Riggs' arrest.
I take full responsibility!

01:40:17.186 --> 01:40:19.562
The son of a bitch
killed two of our men!

01:40:25.485 --> 01:40:26.986
Get him, kid!
He's yours!

01:40:41.919 --> 01:40:43.669
Come on, Riggs! Come on!

01:40:52.221 --> 01:40:54.931
You wanna quit now?
You wanna quit?

01:41:04.483 --> 01:41:06.484
Give me your nightstick!

01:41:16.495 --> 01:41:17.536
Come on!

01:41:18.372 --> 01:41:19.789
Show me what you got!

01:41:26.713 --> 01:41:28.214
Eat this, sucker!

01:41:53.907 --> 01:41:54.991
Let them take him!

01:41:55.993 --> 01:41:57.493
Let me take him!

01:41:59.663 --> 01:42:01.247
No! Back off!

01:42:40.037 --> 01:42:41.412
Break his fucking neck!

01:42:49.463 --> 01:42:50.463
It's not worth it.

01:42:56.595 --> 01:42:57.928
You lose.

01:43:06.563 --> 01:43:08.731
Get that shit off my lawn!

01:43:13.862 --> 01:43:15.237
How you doing, kid?

01:43:40.847 --> 01:43:42.181
I got you.

01:43:42.641 --> 01:43:44.100
I got you, partner.

01:44:20.971 --> 01:44:23.139
Merry Christmas, Victoria Lynn.

01:44:24.891 --> 01:44:26.183
I love you.

01:44:51.334 --> 01:44:52.501
How are you?

01:44:53.170 --> 01:44:55.504
I'm going to be all right. You?

01:44:55.881 --> 01:44:57.173
I'm good.

01:45:00.343 --> 01:45:02.219
Give this to your dad, okay?

01:45:02.554 --> 01:45:05.723
It's a present for him.
Tell him I won't need it anymore.

01:45:06.516 --> 01:45:09.560
- It's a bullet.
- Yeah, it's a bullet.

01:45:10.353 --> 01:45:11.896
He'll understand.

01:45:13.607 --> 01:45:15.691
You want to come in?
We're building.

01:45:17.652 --> 01:45:19.612
No, I gotta go.

01:45:21.948 --> 01:45:24.033
You have a nice Christmas, though.

01:45:24.576 --> 01:45:25.868
Okay. You too.

01:45:26.912 --> 01:45:27.912
Okay. Bye.

01:45:28.205 --> 01:45:29.371
Bye.

01:45:44.387 --> 01:45:46.472
After all we've been through...

01:45:46.681 --> 01:45:50.893
...if you think I'm gonna eat
the world's worst turkey by myself...

01:45:51.144 --> 01:45:52.269
...you're crazy.

01:45:53.396 --> 01:45:56.273
- I'll tell you a little secret.
- What?

01:45:56.483 --> 01:45:57.816
I'm not crazy.

01:46:00.445 --> 01:46:01.445
I know.

01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:03.405
Oh, good. Let's eat.

01:46:04.991 --> 01:46:06.534
Hey, you know something?

01:46:06.743 --> 01:46:08.702
I think your daughter likes me.

01:46:08.954 --> 01:46:11.330
- If you touch her, I'll kill you.
- You'll try.

01:46:11.581 --> 01:46:14.833
- You mind if I bring a friend?
- Of course, bring a friend.

01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:25.469
I don't think the cat
will like this.

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.763
I'll put five on the mutt.

01:46:36.690 --> 01:46:38.899
I'm too old for this.

01:49:26.151 --> 01:49:28.152
