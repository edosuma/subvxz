WEBVTT

00:00.250 --> 00:01.956
<i>It was a drunken moment of weakness.</i>

00:02.001 --> 00:04.540
<i>It doesn't have to mean
anything more than that.</i>

00:04.713 --> 00:07.922
You need to stay away from Leah.
She's got nothing to do with any of this.

00:08.007 --> 00:10.000
- You're pregnant?
- Yeah.

00:11.470 --> 00:14.383
I've lost my engagement ring.
I think Rose took it.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.158
You sure you don't want
any more wine, Leah?

00:16.183 --> 00:17.264
- Give me that!
- Argh!

00:17.684 --> 00:19.801
<i>She set me up, Adam. She's clever.</i>

00:20.062 --> 00:23.226
Rose isn't just your student.
She's your sister.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.518
Your mother was the coward.

00:25.567 --> 00:29.151
And it's not Pam's fault your mother
didn't love you enough to stick around!

00:29.196 --> 00:31.529
You can't just cheat, Adam,
and expect to get away with it.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.654
St Helen's College, Porter's Office.
How can I help?

00:35.702 --> 00:37.864
Something bad's happened
and I need your help.

00:37.913 --> 00:42.248
You are still not convinced
that we got the right one.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074

01:35.304 --> 01:38.199
So you arrived back
at the house at around quarter past midnight

01:38.223 --> 01:39.259
is that correct?

01:39.975 --> 01:42.092
And that's where you spoke
to Adam about the photo?

01:42.603 --> 01:45.937
No, I spoke to Adam
about the photo the first time.

01:47.024 --> 01:49.562
I went back,
and that would have been about...

01:50.694 --> 01:51.694
ten.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.688
The second time... he was already...

01:56.325 --> 01:57.325
dead.

02:00.704 --> 02:05.199
So, er... I checked to see if he was...

02:05.500 --> 02:07.207
um, breathing, but there...

02:08.544 --> 02:10.752
So I phoned the police and, erm...

02:11.798 --> 02:14.506
I just held him until they arrived.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.469
So you arrived back at the party at 10:40

02:18.513 --> 02:21.005
but then you left again 40 minutes later.

02:21.516 --> 02:22.632
Why?
- I'm sorry.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.971
Why are we sat here doing nothing?
We know who did this.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.137
Have you found Rose?
Have you arrested her yet?

02:27.856 --> 02:32.647
There was a phone call made
from your home phone at 11:27.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.070
Did you make that call?

02:34.112 --> 02:36.445
No, because I didn't get back
until quarter past twelve!

02:36.490 --> 02:38.482
How many times do I have to say this to you?

02:38.533 --> 02:41.901
Sorry, Leah, I know this is hard,
but we just have to triple check.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.306
What was the argument about?

02:45.040 --> 02:46.076
With your father?

02:47.959 --> 02:49.666
Who... who was that to?

02:50.003 --> 02:51.960
- Sorry?
- That phone call?

02:54.508 --> 02:55.508
Who was it to?

02:58.595 --> 03:01.679
There was a call made
to this college at 23:27 last night.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.288
- Was it you that answered?
- Yeah, it would've been, yeah.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.267
D'you remember what it was about?

03:06.311 --> 03:09.645
We only get two or three calls
in the night, y'know

03:09.690 --> 03:11.810
it's mainly the international students.
Wait up, Tray.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.378
Here you are, mate.
- Thank you.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.769
There was a man asking to speak to his son.

03:15.821 --> 03:18.313
Err... it was a little bit earlier...

03:19.157 --> 03:21.490
what time did you say, 11:30?
- 11:27.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.778
Ah! That was a woman
asking to talk to a student.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.992
Do you remember the student's name?
- Rose Vaughan.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.370
You know her?
- Yeah, yeah. I mean, to speak to.

03:30.419 --> 03:32.331
I try and get to know the students
a little bit.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.836
Makes the job a bit more bearable.

03:34.965 --> 03:37.002
Thank you, that's very helpful.
- That's alright.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.220
Could you show me up
to Rose's room, please, sir?

03:39.261 --> 03:40.672
Yeah, no problem.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.003
Leah...

04:20.927 --> 04:23.089
Mum.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.680
- Love...
- I asked for you, Mum. What's he doing here?

04:30.812 --> 04:32.895
I'm sorry, I can wait...
- No, no. Hang on a minute.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.226
We need to sort this out.
- You could have stopped this.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.312
You had so many chances to tell the truth.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.774
Sweetheart, how could he possibly
have known what was gonna happen?

04:40.781 --> 04:42.488
Why are you defending him, Mum?

04:42.532 --> 04:45.400
He cheated on you
and he lied about it for 20 years!

04:45.452 --> 04:46.693
You know what?

04:47.954 --> 04:49.070
I don't give a shit.

04:51.374 --> 04:55.288
If you can live like that, if you can treat
Mum like that and live with yourself, fine.

04:55.462 --> 04:58.375
And Mum, if you wanna forgive him,
you wanna take him back, that's fine.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.007
I don't care.

05:02.511 --> 05:05.254
You saw what Rose was doing to me.
What she was putting me through.

05:05.305 --> 05:09.094
What she was putting me and Adam through
and you stood by and you did nothing.

05:10.811 --> 05:11.972
You're selfish, Dad.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.263
Leah, sorry. Sorry to interrupt.

05:15.315 --> 05:19.309
Just to let you know,
we'll need you to formally identify Adam.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.698
Sorry. Can you just give us a minute?

05:25.700 --> 05:27.236
Yeah. Sure. Of course.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.751
Thank you.
You'll get these back, don't worry.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.373
I can't believe it. Poor Adam.

05:42.801 --> 05:46.670
So you say you left here at 21:40...

05:47.264 --> 05:50.007
returning around midnight.
Can you tell us where you went?

05:50.934 --> 05:52.141
Just for a walk.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.061
Where did you go?

05:55.105 --> 05:57.813
Just... down by the river for a bit.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.539
You went down to the river at night
on your own for over two hours?

06:01.319 --> 06:02.435
I like it down there.

06:02.654 --> 06:03.770
Did you talk to anyone?

06:06.074 --> 06:09.533
So you weren't in your room
at 23:27 to receive a phone call?

06:10.620 --> 06:12.828
No.
- Does it have a answering service?

06:14.624 --> 06:17.742
Er... dunno. I hardly use it, to be honest.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.753
Do you mind if I check it?
- Yeah, sure.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.425
Y'know, whatever she's said about me,
it's not true.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.303
She hates me. You can ask anyone.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.806
Can you describe
your relationship with Adam Dale?

06:33.018 --> 06:34.018
Erm...

06:36.813 --> 06:38.395
I met him about six months ago.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.857
I was serving
at St Helen's Christmas function.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.936
I went outside for a cigarette
and he came out and asked me for one.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.731
So he was the one
who instigated the relationship?

06:48.617 --> 06:53.487
At that point it was just a conversation
but, yeah, I guess he did start it.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.489
So what happened next?

06:57.042 --> 06:59.409
He started waiting for me after class.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.374
Leave me little presents in my pigeon hole.

07:04.341 --> 07:05.548
So how far did it go?

07:06.468 --> 07:07.468
Erm...

07:09.471 --> 07:10.471
We slept together.

07:10.972 --> 07:11.972
When?

07:14.601 --> 07:15.637
A few months back.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.470
It was at Adam's house.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.893
Leah was at some conference.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.396
I felt terrible, so I told her everything.

07:25.904 --> 07:26.985
She got angry.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.156
Threatening.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.574
She bullied me in front of the whole class.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.994
She got obsessed.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.072
She broke in here. She even attacked me.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.670
She thought I'd stolen her engagement ring,
so she just ripped it off my finger.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.335
But you hadn't?
- Of course not.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.506
So it was you that ended
the relationship with Adam?

07:52.472 --> 07:53.472
Yeah, I tried to.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.474
We slept together once more after that.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.979
When was that?
- Last night.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.484
Excuse me?

08:06.403 --> 08:07.610
About nine o'clock.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.567
Did Leah find out about this?

08:12.826 --> 08:15.034
I guess so.
- You mean you didn't tell her?

08:17.122 --> 08:20.365
No, but I'm assuming that Adam did.

08:22.794 --> 08:26.037
I think it would be unfair
to describe it as an attack.

08:26.339 --> 08:30.379
But she forcibly removed the ring
from Rose's finger?

08:31.886 --> 08:33.548
Leah had lost hers earlier that day.

08:33.847 --> 08:37.260
The one Rose was wearing looked similar
but there was no inscription on the inside.

08:37.558 --> 08:38.595
She made a mistake.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.058
Would you say you and Leah were friends?

08:45.442 --> 08:47.274
I'd say we were friendly colleagues.

08:47.569 --> 08:50.357
Have you noticed a change
in her behaviour over the last few weeks?

08:50.613 --> 08:52.104
She's been under a lot of pressure.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.402
Did she ever speak about Adam?

08:54.993 --> 08:56.484
In passing, sometimes.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.821
What was the nature of those conversations?

09:01.291 --> 09:05.251
I don't know, I mean, look -
no relationship is perfect, is it?

09:18.016 --> 09:19.223
Why are we back in here?

09:19.350 --> 09:22.309
I... you said you wanted me to identify Adam?

09:22.353 --> 09:25.249
Sorry, Leah, it's just one or two
more quick questions, shouldn't take long.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.793
Why didn't you tell us that Adam and Rose
were having an affair?

09:30.320 --> 09:33.563
A bit of flirting and a... text.

09:33.615 --> 09:34.901
I'd hardly call that an affair.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.066
Rose says they slept together six months ago.

09:37.911 --> 09:38.911
Right...

09:43.208 --> 09:44.208
Rose is lying.

09:45.794 --> 09:49.913
Adam met her about ten days ago
when she turned up at our house

09:49.964 --> 09:52.672
in the middle of the night, uninvited.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.128
She says she told you about it.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.669
That you got angry. Started threatening her?

10:00.183 --> 10:04.928
Until two weeks ago,
Rose was just another student in my class.

10:05.772 --> 10:06.933
Barely noticed her.

10:06.981 --> 10:10.395
So you're telling us you're also unaware
that Adam and Rose slept together again

10:10.443 --> 10:11.318
last night at 9:00pm...

10:11.320 --> 10:14.062
She's a fucking liar!
How many times do I have to tell you?

10:19.577 --> 10:21.364
This was taken last night at 9:00 pm.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.821
About an hour before you spoke to Adam
at your house.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.060
Do you have a solicitor?

11:28.855 --> 11:30.062
Look, I can call Graham.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.644
Now, he does family law,
but I'm sure he could recommend...

11:32.692 --> 11:35.480
I am not getting a lawyer.
I haven't done anything wrong.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.922
Of course you haven't love, I just...

11:36.946 --> 11:38.507
And what does getting a lawyer
make me look like?

11:38.531 --> 11:42.070
Right, you think about that.
- Just go and take five minutes, sweetheart.

11:42.118 --> 11:45.202
I don't need five minutes, Mum,
I just need people to do their jobs properly.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.330
Leah, I just think you need to slow down!

11:49.292 --> 11:50.292
Oh, God...

11:52.337 --> 11:53.453
Right, here we are.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.788
D'you want me to open the window a bit?
It's a bit, er...

11:55.840 --> 11:57.581
Ah, thanks Ben, we'll take it from here.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.885
Oh, right, it's just I need to lock up.
- Yeah.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.427
We'll send someone to find you.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.181
Oh. OK.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.840
Yeah, good luck!

12:07.310 --> 12:09.768
Knife's been found in a bin
down the street from the house.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.348
Lab report should be in a few hours.

12:24.786 --> 12:27.324
Graham Monaghan, please?
It's Michael Shadley.

12:28.748 --> 12:29.748
Yes, thank you.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.582
Graham will be able to represent her.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.754
It'll be OK.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.879
Shouldn't we talk to Leah first?

12:38.424 --> 12:41.258
Graham. Yes. Yes.

12:41.719 --> 12:45.212
It's about something else actually.
Have you got five minutes?

12:58.611 --> 13:01.979
Well, well, well.
I wondered when you'd show up.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.399
The police were in touch.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.406
Asking me all sorts of questions.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.491
About what you were like as a child, or...

13:10.748 --> 13:13.240
all the blotches and blemishes
on your record.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.703
I'm happy to say I think
I fulfilled my civic duty to the full.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.295
Glad to hear it.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.132
Now what is it you've done exactly?

13:23.553 --> 13:26.045
I just came to tell you
that I'm going away for a while.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.799
You came all this way out here
just to tell me that, did you?

13:31.394 --> 13:33.932
Well, I need some money.
- Oh, yes, there we have it.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.393
You know, I always knew you had no morals

13:36.441 --> 13:39.605
but I thought you might have
a modicum of pride - obviously not.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.228
Dad, please can you...
- "Dad"?

13:42.989 --> 13:46.073
"Dad, Dad..." That's desperate, isn't it?

13:46.659 --> 13:47.659
Dad.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.597
Right, OK, then. Shall I just go,
and you'll never see me again?

13:50.621 --> 13:53.955
You see, I always tried to teach you
to stand on your own two feet.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.459
You should never let yourself become
dependent on one single other person.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.369
That way you become you too vulnerable.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.084
Just like your mother.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.613
Come on, boy.
- I can't believe how much of my life

14:06.637 --> 14:08.128
I spent scared of you.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.515
Yes, well, if you've finished begging,
I've got to get back to the hospital.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.634
Only really came out to clear my head.

14:14.145 --> 14:17.309
I wouldn't worry too much.
You move on pretty quick.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.147
Did last time.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.086
I don't know what it is you've done exactly

14:21.110 --> 14:23.944
but whatever it is,
I hope they throw you into a very dark hole.

14:24.572 --> 14:27.009
That way you'll go out of this world
the way you came into it.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.615
Rotten to the core.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.704
Oh! Sorry to disturb.

14:41.756 --> 14:46.091
I don't suppose you've got a spare key
for the filing cabinet in Leah Dale's office?

14:46.469 --> 14:48.176
Not that I would have, sorry.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.712
Oh. OK.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.092
Not to worry.

14:52.934 --> 14:56.974
Oh, by the way, you know that phone call
you transferred to Rose?

14:57.021 --> 14:57.938
Yeah?

14:57.940 --> 14:59.851
You transferred that straight away,
I presume?

15:00.650 --> 15:02.232
Yeah, well, basically, yeah.

15:02.527 --> 15:05.361
Oh, strange, cos she wasn't in
and there was no message.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.317
Oh! It must have been deleted.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.357
OK. Thank you.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.624
Hammond?

15:19.377 --> 15:20.959
Yeah. I'll be right there.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.045
- I'll chat to you later.
- Yeah.

15:30.638 --> 15:31.638
What you got?

15:32.598 --> 15:35.716
A letter to Leah from Rose,
telling her about the affair.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.639
Leah was lying to us.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.187
It's dated over three months ago.

15:42.733 --> 15:45.771
"I never meant for it to happen,
but your husband was persistent

15:45.820 --> 15:48.733
and I found his advances flattering
and hard to turn down.

15:49.991 --> 15:55.407
I have tried many times to end it with Adam,
but he keeps begging me not to stop."

15:58.124 --> 15:59.124
Erm...

16:00.126 --> 16:03.915
can you contact forensics and check
if they've found any of Rose Vaughan's prints

16:03.963 --> 16:05.454
in the Dale's bedroom, yeah?
- Ma'am.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.839
Good man.
- Lab report on the knife's in.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.090
What's it say?

16:09.427 --> 16:11.009
Two sets of partial prints.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.419
One belongs to Adam Dale.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.134
The other to Leah Dale.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.473
The police are in your office, Leah.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.878
<i>How long have they been there?
Who let them in?</i>

16:25.902 --> 16:29.361
A few hours apparently.
Erm... they had a warrant.

16:33.701 --> 16:34.701
Leah.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.569
You know I love you, don't you, mate?

16:42.084 --> 16:43.084
You still there?

16:44.253 --> 16:45.253
Yeah.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.380
<i>I just...</i>

16:47.798 --> 16:50.461
<i>If there's anything you need to tell me</i>

16:51.886 --> 16:53.468
I'll support you through anything.

16:55.556 --> 16:56.922
I just want you to know that.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.517
<i>I don't mean that you... I just, um...</i>

17:00.561 --> 17:02.018
<i>I just want you to know...</i>

17:09.819 --> 17:10.819
Leah?

17:11.405 --> 17:12.405
Leah!

17:29.507 --> 17:30.627
Thank you, everyone.

17:34.345 --> 17:35.345
Rose?

17:38.432 --> 17:39.548
We need to talk. Now.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.263
I don't think we should be talking...
- I need you to stop this.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.355
I need you to tell them.
It's... for your own good.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.891
They'll find something.
- I hope so.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.480
Stop that. Stop!

17:52.989 --> 17:54.651
I'm really sorry to hear about Adam.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.780
Have you got any idea what happened?

18:01.122 --> 18:03.990
What, you don't think that I could...
- They think I did it, Rose.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.668
Who else could it be?

18:16.887 --> 18:18.003
Tell me the truth.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.382
You really want to know the truth?

18:24.520 --> 18:25.520
Yeah.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.186
I'm your sister.

18:37.825 --> 18:38.825
And I love you.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.741
I wish there was a way
that we could both walk out of this

18:43.789 --> 18:44.905
but there isn't.

18:45.708 --> 18:46.708
We can't.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.226
I'm sorry.

19:23.704 --> 19:24.911
They've found something.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.170
Here.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.040
The truth will out, Rose.

19:42.932 --> 19:43.932
She's here.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.354
Here she is.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.810
Leah Dale, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of the murder of Adam Dale.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.097
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

20:05.121 --> 20:08.330
if you do not mention when questioned
something which you later rely on in court.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.366
Anything you do say may be given in evidence.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.934
I have never seen this letter
before in my life.

20:32.314 --> 20:33.646
It's got your fingerprints on it.

20:34.525 --> 20:36.642
Well, then she's written it on my paper.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.318
And how did she get into your office?

20:42.783 --> 20:44.991
I'm sorry, these are the questions
the police will ask.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.076
She's...

20:48.080 --> 20:50.242
This is insane...

20:51.500 --> 20:52.957
These questions are ridiculous.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.124
OK. What about the knife?

20:58.841 --> 21:01.629
Well, it's my knife,
so yes, it has my fingerprints on it.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.502
Yes, yours only.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.266
And Adam's.

21:08.809 --> 21:09.809
Not Rose's.

21:12.229 --> 21:16.098
OK, let's go through your movements
that night one more time.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.020
So... what have you got?

22:01.612 --> 22:04.821
As your report says, the knife was wiped down
but clearly in a hurry.

22:04.865 --> 22:08.404
The lab found blood particles from the victim
and two sets of partial fingerprints.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.243
One from Adam. One from Leah.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.057
Karen, you told us this yesterday.

22:12.081 --> 22:13.447
You said you had something new?

22:13.958 --> 22:14.958
Well...

22:19.171 --> 22:20.707
So, what are we looking at?

22:21.215 --> 22:24.879
This stab wound here in the chest
is consistent with the murder weapon

22:24.927 --> 22:27.761
but these two, here in the neck
and the second chest wound.

22:28.597 --> 22:31.010
- And they seem off slightly.
- Off?

22:31.058 --> 22:34.267
In terms of blade diameter
and possibly serration.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.556
So what are you saying?

22:35.604 --> 22:39.393
Well, I'm suggesting that these wounds
were made by two different knives.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.513
<i>I dunno, something doesn't feel right.</i>

22:51.537 --> 22:53.818
<i>You heard yourself, she's only half sure.</i>

22:54.206 --> 22:57.074
We've got enough to charge her.
- We've got until tonight though, right?

22:57.293 --> 23:00.036
Bould, she was in the house, twice,
by her own admission.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.357
We've got the murder weapon, a motive,
she lied about Rose

23:02.381 --> 23:04.748
it's more than enough, OK?
- I know, I know. It's just...

23:05.301 --> 23:07.463
I was going over some footage this morning

23:07.511 --> 23:10.845
and it looks to me like the jacket
Rose was wearing on the night

23:10.890 --> 23:13.507
is a different colour to the one she gave us.

23:14.476 --> 23:15.393
It's what?

23:15.395 --> 23:17.434
Look, the images aren't clear.
It's hard to be sure.

23:17.855 --> 23:18.855
I wanna search her room.

23:19.023 --> 23:21.731
Just for elimination purposes,
if nothing else.

23:23.527 --> 23:24.527
Please, sir.

23:25.946 --> 23:28.233
Five o'clock. Then I'm charging her.

23:32.244 --> 23:35.533
Hi, yeah, this is DS Bould.
Yeah, I'm gonna need a warrant.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.374
You need to have a word with her.
Ask her to cooperate.

24:21.418 --> 24:24.536
What about Rose? Can't you talk to someone?
- Michael, listen to me.

24:25.381 --> 24:26.981
The police have enough for a conviction.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.795
With a guilty plea,
I can probably get manslaughter.

24:31.929 --> 24:32.929
Have a word with her.

24:33.514 --> 24:35.380
I can't help her when she's being like this.

24:37.059 --> 24:38.766
What kind of advice is that?
- Michael...

24:38.811 --> 24:40.848
And the amount we're paying him...
- Michael.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.931
If anything happens to her,
I'll never forgive you.

25:30.446 --> 25:31.732
<i>I found two rings.</i>

25:32.531 --> 25:35.319
- Proves she was lying.
<i>- Yeah, but that's all it proves.</i>

25:35.367 --> 25:37.609
Oh, come on!

25:37.661 --> 25:40.574
<i>She said she slept with Adam
for the first time in his bedroom</i>

25:40.581 --> 25:41.725
but we didn't find a single print.

25:41.749 --> 25:43.643
And then there's the phone call
to the porter's office

25:43.667 --> 25:46.956
<i>and I just saw her, and it looks like
she's got marks on her neck.</i>

25:47.337 --> 25:50.501
Did you find the jacket?
Did you find any material evidence?

25:51.133 --> 25:52.795
<i>I wanna search Ben's accommodation.</i>

25:53.427 --> 25:54.427
No, Bould.

25:54.887 --> 25:55.887
I'm sorry.

26:17.409 --> 26:20.493
Leah Dale, I'm charging you
with the murder of Adam Dale.

26:21.622 --> 26:24.100
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence...

26:24.124 --> 26:27.083
when questioned something
which you later rely on in court.

26:41.391 --> 26:42.427
<i>What d'you want?</i>

26:42.476 --> 26:43.967
We need to talk.

26:44.770 --> 26:45.770
Why?

26:46.814 --> 26:48.146
Meet me tomorrow morning.

26:49.733 --> 26:50.733
No.

26:50.943 --> 26:51.943
Rose.

26:52.820 --> 26:53.820
<i>Bye, Michael.</i>

26:53.862 --> 26:58.482
Wait! What if I told you
to meet me at the Emerald Bay cafe?

26:58.659 --> 26:59.659
What?

27:00.911 --> 27:02.277
How'd you know about that place?

27:02.329 --> 27:04.241
<i>Just meet me there tomorrow morning.</i>

27:04.832 --> 27:05.832
Ten AM.

28:24.786 --> 28:25.902
Thank you for coming.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.325
How'd you know about this place?

28:29.374 --> 28:32.458
First you tell me the truth about Adam...
- Don't mess me about, Michael.

28:32.502 --> 28:35.142
How d'you know about this place?
- Not until you tell me the truth.

28:35.923 --> 28:38.415
OK. OK. Sit down. Sit.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.429
It was my idea to meet here
the night your mum passed.

28:46.433 --> 28:49.767
You, me and her were going to leave together

28:50.395 --> 28:53.263
on the ferry to France
and start a new life there.

28:54.483 --> 28:55.690
Why would we do that?

28:56.026 --> 28:58.609
It was just a fling.
- That's what I told everyone.

28:58.654 --> 29:01.067
But in fact your mother and I were...

29:02.366 --> 29:04.073
seeing each other for six years.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.200
Very much in love.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.113
You and I were quite good pals
when you were little.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.165
You're lying.

29:13.126 --> 29:16.745
I dunno why I kept these, but there we are.
See for yourself.

29:25.931 --> 29:28.014
I had a job lined up and everything.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.550
I promised her a new life.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.602
But I only made it as far as the entrance.

29:34.064 --> 29:35.851
I could see her through the window.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.107
Her back was to me, she was talking to you

29:38.318 --> 29:41.231
and you were laughing about something. I...

29:45.993 --> 29:47.450
I watched you both for a while.

29:47.786 --> 29:51.029
I vividly remember wondering
what you were laughing about.

29:54.835 --> 29:55.871
But I couldn't do it.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.373
Then I turned around
and went home to my wife.

30:02.843 --> 30:03.959
And what about me?

30:04.761 --> 30:07.845
I convinced myself
you were not my responsibility. I'm sorry.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.471
I don't think Mum saw it like that.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.633
If I had any idea
of what she was going to do...

30:11.685 --> 30:13.301
It was that table, wasn't it?

30:14.271 --> 30:15.352
That one.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.849
When you didn't turn up, she left me here.

30:21.445 --> 30:23.778
I sat there for hours before a waitress came.

30:24.031 --> 30:25.317
Called the police.

30:27.659 --> 30:31.369
I was just staring at the door,
waiting for her to come back.

30:32.456 --> 30:34.118
But she's not coming back, is she?

30:37.169 --> 30:39.456
What happened to Adam, Rose?
- Oh, shut up!

30:39.963 --> 30:42.125
Why are you telling me all this? Why now?

30:42.257 --> 30:45.170
Leah is going to prison for the rest
of her life, do you understand that?

30:45.594 --> 30:46.880
Why did you bring me here?

30:47.262 --> 30:49.675
It's not Leah's fault.
And it's not yours either.

30:49.723 --> 30:51.339
Do you know why? Because it's my fault.

30:51.391 --> 30:52.677
And what about me?

30:53.185 --> 30:55.051
I was just a kid. What about me?

30:55.437 --> 30:59.056
I'm sorry, but Leah does not deserve
to be punished for my mistakes.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.310
And neither do I.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.653
He put his hands around my neck.

31:06.239 --> 31:08.231
Look!
- You mean Adam? Adam did?

31:08.283 --> 31:11.321
He put his hands around my neck
and he squeezed until I couldn't see.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.702
I couldn't breathe.

31:19.419 --> 31:22.207
All I could feel was a thudding in my head
and his breath on my face.

31:22.381 --> 31:23.462
So you stabbed him?

31:24.674 --> 31:26.791
He was going to kill you,
so you killed him first

31:26.843 --> 31:27.879
is that what happened?

31:30.847 --> 31:33.555
I reached back,
and I felt something in my hand.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.352
I didn't even know I was doing it.

31:39.773 --> 31:40.773
But I had to.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.691
It was the only way to get him off me.

31:48.448 --> 31:49.529
You killed Adam?

31:55.414 --> 31:56.414
Yeah.

31:58.667 --> 31:59.667
I killed him.

32:04.297 --> 32:06.234
<i>If it was self-defence, why did you lie?</i>

32:06.258 --> 32:07.874
Because who's gonna believe me?

32:08.885 --> 32:11.423
No one has my whole life.
So why would they start now?

32:13.890 --> 32:15.597
I wish I'd told the police straight away.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.222
But it's too late now.

32:19.521 --> 32:22.309
No one'll believe me
and I'm sorry it's not fair on Leah

32:22.357 --> 32:24.690
but it's just the way it is.

32:31.241 --> 32:33.574
I'm sorry. Really am.

32:38.248 --> 32:39.534
So am I, Rose.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.043
Dad?

32:43.628 --> 32:44.709
What have you done?

32:45.380 --> 32:47.087
Because Leah comes first.

32:50.635 --> 32:54.128
Rose Vaughan, I am arresting you
on suspicion of the murder of Adam Dale.

32:54.181 --> 32:56.576
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

32:56.600 --> 32:59.787
if you do not mention when questioned
something which you later rely on in court.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.645
Anything you do say may be given in evidence.

33:03.064 --> 33:04.350
This is all on you.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.749
Well, I know how much
you hate service stations.

34:06.503 --> 34:07.503
Thank you.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.722
And if you're feeling tired, you should stop.

34:11.091 --> 34:12.091
Yeah.

34:14.511 --> 34:16.252
I'm so sorry it's come to this.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.393
Yeah.

34:46.126 --> 34:48.413
To mark the release of Leah's new book

34:48.795 --> 34:51.161
her second in just under three years

34:51.797 --> 34:54.380
which of course
is highly embarrassing for the rest of us.

34:58.013 --> 35:02.132
Now, this latest work
really is a remarkable achievement

35:02.309 --> 35:05.427
and it was a privilege
to be involved in some small capacity.

35:08.815 --> 35:11.558
So without further ado, to Leah!

35:12.152 --> 35:14.895
- To Leah!
- Thank you.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.306
Thanks, everyone. Thanks, Stephan.

35:17.866 --> 35:20.904
Do you think you can have him
for a few hours on Saturday for me, Mum?

35:20.952 --> 35:22.614
Yeah, course, I'd love to.

35:22.621 --> 35:26.080
Maybe take him to the city farm or something.
I might be gone the whole morning.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.535
Yeah, sure.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.541
What you up to?

35:30.503 --> 35:32.244
Look, Mum, don't worry, but...

35:32.797 --> 35:35.005
I've heard from Rose. She wants to talk.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.166
She's being let out three months from now

35:37.260 --> 35:39.217
so I need to go and see her
before she gets out.

35:39.262 --> 35:40.262
No.

35:40.972 --> 35:41.972
Oh...

35:43.183 --> 35:44.390
why would you do that?

35:44.768 --> 35:47.511
We haven't heard anything from her
for two years, it...

35:48.229 --> 35:49.390
worries me, Mum.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.229
I just don't understand

35:51.274 --> 35:53.106
why you still need to see her now.

35:54.694 --> 35:57.494
Because what am I gonna tell him, Mum?
When he asks me about his daddy?

35:57.530 --> 35:58.771
What am I gonna say to him?

36:00.158 --> 36:01.615
I need to look her in the eye

36:02.035 --> 36:05.028
and I need her to tell me
what she said to him that night.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.892
I need to understand
what there was between them.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.123
Why he did what he did.

36:11.711 --> 36:16.126
Cos every time I think about Adam,
she's there too, and I just...

36:19.010 --> 36:20.376
I want to miss him, Mum.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.181
Properly.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.230
Hi, Leah.

36:32.857 --> 36:33.857
How are you?

36:34.067 --> 36:35.478
How shall we do this?

36:36.695 --> 36:39.062
We've got half an hour, Leah.
What d'you want to talk about?

36:39.447 --> 36:40.447
Adam.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.482
I want you to tell me
what happened that night.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.235
And I want you to tell me
what he meant to you.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.161
You don't miss him, do you?

36:51.376 --> 36:52.376
It's OK.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.078
You can't help how you feel.

36:56.506 --> 36:59.044
It's amazing how quickly
you can adjust to life without someone

36:59.092 --> 37:01.052
if you never really loved them
in the first place.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.006
You don't know what you're talking about.

37:04.347 --> 37:05.347
OK.

37:06.099 --> 37:07.099
Why do you care?

37:07.392 --> 37:08.678
Because he attacked you.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.176
I want to know why.

37:11.438 --> 37:12.645
I didn't want to hurt you.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.524
Didn't want to stab Adam like I did.

37:17.819 --> 37:18.935
But I don't regret it.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.272
Well, you were protecting yourself,
weren't you?

37:23.450 --> 37:24.486
Come on, Leah!

37:25.702 --> 37:28.536
This is why you came here, isn't it?
To find out the truth?

37:31.082 --> 37:34.166
Well, the truth is that I did you
a fucking favour that night.

37:36.463 --> 37:37.463
What d'you mean?

37:39.382 --> 37:41.840
You never really believed
it was self-defence, did you?

37:45.972 --> 37:47.008
He deserved it.

37:50.852 --> 37:53.219
Do you know how easy it was
for me to flatter you?

37:54.147 --> 37:55.638
What, to get inside your head?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.231
It was just a joke.

37:58.026 --> 37:59.733
You should be ashamed of yourself.

38:04.407 --> 38:05.488
What's wrong with you?

38:07.535 --> 38:09.743
Alright then, er...
actually, I might tell Leah.

38:11.372 --> 38:13.910
I wonder if she'll keep that baby.
I know that I wouldn't.

38:16.336 --> 38:17.872
Everyone's got a breaking point.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.256
Adam barely touched me that night.

38:26.221 --> 38:27.678
Feels good, doesn't it?

38:29.849 --> 38:31.090
Get out of this house.

38:31.267 --> 38:33.634
Just get out.
I don't care what you do anymore.

38:33.686 --> 38:35.302
I just want you out of my fucking house.

38:38.274 --> 38:39.765
Got you a little present.

38:42.529 --> 38:43.736
Just to remember me by.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.536
No wonder your mother
couldn't live with herself.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.544
She gave birth to a monster.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.675
Y'know what, actually I might stay.

39:08.388 --> 39:09.424
Do what you like.

39:11.391 --> 39:12.723
I'm calling the police.

39:19.607 --> 39:20.643
Why are you lying?

39:22.485 --> 39:23.485
Why would I?

39:24.654 --> 39:26.771
<i>You told Dad it was self-defence.</i>

39:27.490 --> 39:29.482
<i>I just told him what he needed to hear.</i>

39:33.997 --> 39:35.659
There were bruises on your neck.

39:36.291 --> 39:37.291
Just do it.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.037
<i>It was Ben's idea.</i>

39:41.838 --> 39:42.999
<i>I called him that night.</i>

39:47.135 --> 39:49.502
St Helen's College, Porter's Office.
How can I help?

39:51.139 --> 39:53.051
<i>We made a plan to hide the evidence.</i>

39:54.934 --> 39:56.391
Right, take the knife that...

39:57.020 --> 40:00.980
<i>most closely matches
the letter opener you killed Adam with.</i>

40:01.858 --> 40:04.145
<i>Make sure you don't get
your fingerprints on it.</i>

40:05.945 --> 40:07.061
Stab him with it.

40:09.574 --> 40:10.690
<i>It was weird.</i>

40:11.743 --> 40:14.030
<i>Kind of like watching a film, really.</i>

40:15.455 --> 40:16.866
You lied about everything.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.746
Everything, the... the knife.

40:22.462 --> 40:23.462
The letter.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.631
I could have gone to prison
for the rest of my life.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.042
But you didn't, did you?

40:37.685 --> 40:40.849
My child is growing up
without his father because of you.

40:40.897 --> 40:41.933
Exactly!

40:43.191 --> 40:45.729
I put myself in here
so that you and him could be together

40:45.777 --> 40:48.269
and it really irritates me
that you can't even see it.

40:48.446 --> 40:49.446
Why?

40:50.490 --> 40:52.777
Why? He didn't deserve to die.

40:53.076 --> 40:54.317
He cheated on you, Leah.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.533
He slept with me
when he knew that you were pregnant.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.497
Don't tell me you're not happier without him.

41:04.796 --> 41:05.957
You don't need Adam.

41:06.005 --> 41:09.498
And you don't need that coward of a father
so why don't you let me help you?

41:10.259 --> 41:11.420
Do what you can't do?

41:29.946 --> 41:32.859
<i>He ruined my childhood.
He lied to you.</i>

41:32.907 --> 41:35.024
<i>Why do you need him?
Why do you even care?</i>

41:35.076 --> 41:36.076
Enough!

41:37.954 --> 41:41.573
You didn't help me,
you didn't do me a favour.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.115
You ruined my life.

41:50.216 --> 41:53.675
<i>And if you think the fact that we're sisters
means something to me, you're deluded.</i>

41:55.221 --> 41:58.305
You might have convinced everyone else,
Rose, but I see you.

41:59.225 --> 42:01.968
We're not the same
and there is nothing between us.

42:04.188 --> 42:06.680
And we're not the ones to blame, Dad and I.

42:09.694 --> 42:11.686
We're not the ones who made you who you are.

42:13.614 --> 42:16.106
You need to find something
to live for when you leave here

42:16.451 --> 42:18.158
because I will never see you again.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.367
And if you ever come anywhere near my son...

42:27.587 --> 42:28.703
I will kill you.

42:55.239 --> 42:56.239
Yeah?

42:56.866 --> 42:57.866
Hi, it's me.

42:59.869 --> 43:01.405
So what's it gonna be?

43:02.705 --> 43:03.705
<i>Yes or no?</i>

43:23.267 --> 43:25.634
Hello, pet. What...?

43:26.312 --> 43:27.678
I've got someone for you to meet.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.896
Eh, come in! Come on.

43:40.910 --> 43:42.276
- Ah!
- Hello.

43:48.501 --> 43:50.221
- Thanks for coming.
<i>- Dear Leah...</i>

43:50.419 --> 43:52.911
<i>I'm being released next week,
and I wanted to let you know.</i>

43:56.509 --> 43:59.547
<i>You don't have to worry about me.
You'll never see me again.</i>

44:01.305 --> 44:03.763
<i>I thought about what you said
that day when you came to visit.</i>

44:06.144 --> 44:07.635
<i>I wanted to thank you and promise you</i>

44:07.687 --> 44:09.895
<i>from the bottom of my heart
that I will leave you alone.</i>

44:12.775 --> 44:15.142
<i>All of you, even Dad.</i>

44:18.447 --> 44:20.655
<i>Because you're my family
and I want you to be happy.</i>

44:23.077 --> 44:25.865
<i>And you were right
about fixing my problems</i>

44:27.415 --> 44:29.281
<i>finding something to live for.</i>

44:30.626 --> 44:32.037
<i>So I followed your advice...</i>

44:35.006 --> 44:36.668
<i>...and I went back to the start.</i>

44:45.349 --> 44:46.965
<i>I realise the only way I can start again</i>

44:47.018 --> 44:49.454
<i>is if I learn to forgive Mum
and sort things out with William.</i>

44:49.478 --> 44:50.478
Hunter!

44:53.566 --> 44:54.566
Bloody dog...

44:55.902 --> 44:57.188
<i>So that's what I did.</i>

45:05.453 --> 45:07.490
<i>I think I've started to feel better already.</i>

45:09.207 --> 45:10.207
<i>Love, Rose.</i>
