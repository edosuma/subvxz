WEBVTT

00:11.477 --> 00:14.319
I'm getting a really sharp pain here.

00:14.320 --> 00:17.136
And the guy came up and
just went, bam bam bam!

00:17.137 --> 00:19.402
I'm driven insane by this.

00:19.403 --> 00:21.087
You saw an apparition of a woman here.

00:21.088 --> 00:22.253
Right here, yes.

00:22.254 --> 00:23.930
Stop it!

00:23.931 --> 00:26.671
He died in a mental hospital.

00:26.672 --> 00:30.595
I heard this female voice.
There was nobody there.

00:30.596 --> 00:33.236
He went insane.

00:33.591 --> 00:37.251
Oh, I think she got murdered.

00:39.462 --> 00:44.575
(Amy) We will hurt you.
Don't think that we won't.

00:44.576 --> 00:47.696
My name is Amy Allan.

00:48.050 --> 00:49.514
There's something down there.

00:49.515 --> 00:51.100
I see dead people.

00:51.101 --> 00:53.216
He doesn't want me back there.

00:53.217 --> 00:55.411
I speak to dead people...

00:55.412 --> 00:56.701
She's pissed.

00:56.702 --> 00:57.917
And they speak to me.

00:57.918 --> 01:00.303
She doesn't like the people who live here.

01:00.304 --> 01:03.518
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:03.519 --> 01:05.171
Someone did hang themselves here.

01:05.172 --> 01:06.835
- Where?
- There.

01:06.836 --> 01:08.883
I rely on my partner.

01:08.884 --> 01:12.207
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:12.208 --> 01:13.749
Did you want to kill him?

01:13.750 --> 01:17.119
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.962
She did die in this house.

01:18.963 --> 01:20.389
It's my job to reveal them.

01:20.390 --> 01:22.883
Would you be surprised if there
were bodies in the basement?

01:22.884 --> 01:23.690
No.

01:23.691 --> 01:25.224
But Steve and I never speak...

01:25.225 --> 01:27.184
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:27.185 --> 01:28.530
Until the very end.

01:28.531 --> 01:30.019
Not good.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.980
Will we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:31.981 --> 01:33.156
Will it get worse?

01:33.157 --> 01:34.381
Or time to get out?

01:34.382 --> 01:36.546
- Oh, yes.
- Whew.

01:36.547 --> 01:39.607

01:54.590 --> 01:58.250
Steve does the Detective work.

01:58.880 --> 02:02.816
He meets with the homeowners,
interviews the witnesses.

02:02.817 --> 02:04.867
And finds the evidence.

02:04.868 --> 02:10.448
So we can later find out if
there are any correlations.

02:12.267 --> 02:14.854
I'm pulling into Great Falls, Montana.

02:14.855 --> 02:18.614
It's a city that got its name from the
five waterfalls that surround the area.

02:18.615 --> 02:24.012
I'm going to investigate a house
that's about 120 years old.

02:24.013 --> 02:28.524
The home is occupied by a woman, Kelly, who
lives there with her 6-year-old daughter.

02:28.525 --> 02:33.085
Kelly says she's seen a female apparition.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.013
She thinks she's going
crazy, so I'm gonna go

02:37.014 --> 02:42.114
meet with her now and
find out what's going on.

02:48.210 --> 02:54.110
(Amy) Matt comes in before me to
make sure the location is clean.

02:56.485 --> 03:00.022
He takes down any information
that might seem leading.

03:00.023 --> 03:04.403
And could possibly influence my findings.

03:07.882 --> 03:12.212
He basically cleans the slate
before I come in and do my walk.

03:12.213 --> 03:15.213
(Eerie music playing)

03:29.829 --> 03:32.289
(Door creaks)

03:33.300 --> 03:35.640
(Amy sighs)

03:35.803 --> 03:37.495
So... much...

03:37.496 --> 03:39.536
Stress.

03:42.938 --> 03:47.476
Just feeling all these people, and
they're just so stressed out and...

03:47.477 --> 03:48.545
(Sighs)

03:48.546 --> 03:51.906
Worried and unhappy and...

03:55.737 --> 03:57.586
Stop it! Oh!

03:57.587 --> 04:01.067
I'm driven insane by this.

04:01.320 --> 04:05.160
I don't really like this place.

04:06.090 --> 04:09.090
(Eerie music playing)

04:21.110 --> 04:24.549
So, Kelly, now that I'm here, uh, why
don't you explain what's going on?

04:24.550 --> 04:26.515
Well, I bought this house
a couple years ago,

04:26.516 --> 04:29.861
and for some reason, I had to have it.
I felt compelled to buy it.

04:29.862 --> 04:33.827
It was the, um, founder of Great
Falls' home, Paris Gibson.

04:33.828 --> 04:37.696
- Well, what do you know about him?
- Well, he had the house built in 1890,

04:37.697 --> 04:42.588
and he is also the person
that founded Great Falls.

04:42.589 --> 04:47.217
So why don't you try to explain if you can
what, kind of strange things are going on?

04:47.218 --> 04:50.585
Well, when I bought the house
and I started renovating it,

04:50.586 --> 04:56.046
I realized that we weren't
really the only ones here.

04:57.826 --> 05:00.803
(Kelly) There was a lot of
remodel work that I had to do.

05:00.804 --> 05:02.922
I was standing here, looking at the floors,

05:02.923 --> 05:06.622
thinking about what to do with
them, and then I saw the woman.

05:06.623 --> 05:08.891
You saw an apparition of a
woman here in this room.

05:08.892 --> 05:12.422
- Right here, yes.
- Okay, can you describe her for me?

05:12.423 --> 05:16.585
She was very tall and
slender, very well-dressed.

05:16.586 --> 05:19.204
Old clothes, like around
the turn of the century.

05:19.205 --> 05:23.035
And I believe it's Valeria Gibson.

05:23.036 --> 05:24.581
Who's Valeria Gibson?

05:24.582 --> 05:30.482
Valeria Gibson was Paris Gibson's wife,
and I think she still lives here with us.

05:31.859 --> 05:34.462
- Have you ever told anybody that?
- Very few people.

05:34.463 --> 05:37.454
- Do they think you're crazy, or...
- Pretty much.

05:37.455 --> 05:40.431
And then all of a sudden,
after I saw her...

05:40.432 --> 05:42.324
She just tells me things.

05:42.325 --> 05:44.793
They sort of just come to
me, like, in my dreams.

05:44.794 --> 05:47.296
(Steve) Kelly's right...

05:47.297 --> 05:49.352
She may actually be crazy.

05:49.353 --> 05:52.678
If I'm getting this right, you're telling
me she's putting thoughts into your head.

05:52.679 --> 05:54.689
- Yes.
- Okay.

05:54.690 --> 05:58.675
She just sort of tells me what to do.

05:58.676 --> 06:00.876
I came here thinking she
was seeing a ghost.

06:00.877 --> 06:06.777
Now she's telling me that she has a ghost
that's actually controlling her dreams.

06:09.592 --> 06:12.592
(Floorboards creaking)

06:14.901 --> 06:17.747
Someone just walked from here...

06:17.748 --> 06:20.688
Over to the stairs.

06:25.084 --> 06:28.788
I think they're just spying on us.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.849
I think that maybe...

06:31.859 --> 06:35.197
People can see them sometimes.

06:35.198 --> 06:37.008
When I communicate with the dead,

06:37.009 --> 06:41.234
they sometimes tell me about the encounters
they've already had with the living.

06:41.235 --> 06:47.135
Somebody's definitely seen a dead
person here, like an apparition.

06:50.296 --> 06:55.353
When I saw her apparition, it gave me the
idea that I needed to tear this wall out.

06:55.354 --> 06:57.893
And when I tore the wall
out, this is what I found.

06:57.894 --> 07:00.986
This is an old, old inkwell...

07:00.987 --> 07:03.298
From, like, 1895.

07:03.299 --> 07:06.325
And I believe it was Valeria's.

07:06.326 --> 07:09.552
Now do you think she
wanted you to find this?

07:09.553 --> 07:12.253
Oh, I'm sure of it, because I would
never have taken this wall out.

07:12.254 --> 07:15.301
I had no reason to take the wall out.

07:15.302 --> 07:20.267
And I think there's a diary that's still
in this house, but I can't find it.

07:20.268 --> 07:24.544
Kelly's story sounds insane,
but it does make some sense.

07:24.545 --> 07:28.831
She dreamed she'd find something
hidden inside a wall, and she did.

07:28.832 --> 07:31.054
So I get that she would
expect the same result,

07:31.055 --> 07:33.800
when she dreams about a hidden diary.

07:33.801 --> 07:36.801
(Eerie music playing)

07:38.858 --> 07:41.738
(Heartbeat pounding)

07:42.613 --> 07:44.953
(Amy sighs)

08:01.881 --> 08:06.921
Man, they do not want me
to see this, do they?

08:08.255 --> 08:10.475
See what?

08:10.524 --> 08:16.224
I don't know why there's
screaming and yelling going on.

08:17.895 --> 08:21.255
What are you looking for?

08:27.825 --> 08:31.891
That's so weird, I feel almost like...

08:31.892 --> 08:34.628
There should be...

08:34.629 --> 08:36.729
A room.

08:37.097 --> 08:38.758
Mm...

08:38.759 --> 08:41.587
Somebody's putting stuff in there and...

08:41.587 --> 08:43.500
Who's putting stuff in there?

08:43.501 --> 08:45.661
A woman.

08:46.460 --> 08:51.800
(Matt) What kind of stuff
are they putting in there?

08:55.534 --> 08:57.514
Books.

08:59.342 --> 09:01.987
I feel like somebody's in there, but...

09:01.988 --> 09:04.928
Let's pull it out.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.782
Where the [Bleep] did they go?

09:11.783 --> 09:14.843
(Indistinct whispering)

09:25.604 --> 09:28.604
(Eerie music playing)

09:34.691 --> 09:37.445
I feel like it should go through somewhere.

09:37.446 --> 09:40.240
Well, why don't we pull it all out?

09:40.241 --> 09:44.385
(Amy) I can feel that this place was
used for hiding very important things.

09:44.386 --> 09:49.126
But now there's nothing
left but insulation.

09:56.510 --> 09:59.000
(Whispering) Ow.

09:59.001 --> 10:01.101
(Groans)

10:02.506 --> 10:06.276
I'm getting really sharp
pain through my chest...

10:06.277 --> 10:09.457
Really sharp pain here.

10:09.612 --> 10:12.981
I think this is the female.

10:12.982 --> 10:18.485
I'm hearing a female say, yes,
it's me, I died here. Mm-hmm.

10:18.486 --> 10:20.346
How?

10:22.023 --> 10:24.015
(Footsteps)

10:24.016 --> 10:26.896
I'm seeing stairs.

10:30.738 --> 10:32.634
(Steve) This is new territory for me.

10:32.635 --> 10:34.736
I'm standing here with a
woman who's convinced

10:34.737 --> 10:37.560
that a dead woman is implanting
thoughts into her head.

10:37.561 --> 10:40.508
I can tell you what she told
me what happened to her.

10:40.509 --> 10:44.646
She was up here writing, and,
um, her son Theodore came up,

10:44.647 --> 10:46.481
and they got into a confrontation.

10:46.482 --> 10:49.617
And he pushed her down the stairs.

10:49.618 --> 10:51.586
(Woman screaming)

10:51.587 --> 10:53.421
And she broke her neck and died.

10:53.422 --> 10:55.941
- That's what she's relayed to you?
- Yeah. Yes.

10:55.942 --> 10:59.261
That came to me in a... in a dream.

10:59.262 --> 11:02.163
(Amy) She's, like, running up the stairs...
(Heavy breathing)

11:02.164 --> 11:07.384
And then I do see her...
she's falling back down.

11:07.588 --> 11:10.838
Somebody did this to her?

11:10.839 --> 11:12.759
Um...

11:13.335 --> 11:17.295
She's saying it was done to her.

11:17.311 --> 11:20.969
You know, there was a lot
of things done to her.

11:20.970 --> 11:24.389
Her whole life was kind of...

11:24.390 --> 11:26.913
Dictated. And...

11:26.914 --> 11:29.854
How she died was...

11:30.143 --> 11:32.663
Also dictated.

11:33.624 --> 11:37.267
(Amy) I'm actually seeing a woman...

11:37.268 --> 11:40.028
Who was murdered.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.239
(Kelly) Valeria Gibson told me that there's

11:45.240 --> 11:48.543
underground tunnels
underneath the house, too.

11:48.544 --> 11:53.227
And they took her corpse
down to the basement.

11:53.228 --> 11:57.023
And through the tunnels to the Park Hotel.

11:57.024 --> 11:59.067
It says in the newspaper that,

11:59.068 --> 12:02.701
she jumped off the Park Hotel and committed
suicide, but she didn't do that.

12:02.702 --> 12:04.429
She didn't commit suicide.

12:04.430 --> 12:09.705
And I think that's what she wants people to
know, and that's why she's telling me that.

12:09.706 --> 12:13.881
From what you're saying, if she's saying
it, is that they made it look accidental.

12:13.882 --> 12:16.822
It was a cover-up.

12:17.805 --> 12:21.645
And Valeria's telling me that...

12:22.127 --> 12:25.054
The family got the tunnel system going.

12:25.055 --> 12:28.539
These tunnels are all
associated with this house?

12:28.540 --> 12:29.534
Yep.

12:29.535 --> 12:31.853
And you've never seen this tunnel yourself.

12:31.854 --> 12:33.788
- No.
- Okay.

12:33.789 --> 12:37.525
I had a dream, and I know where they are.

12:37.526 --> 12:40.695
But I haven't opened the one
up from underneath my house.

12:40.696 --> 12:42.930
- But I know where it is, yes.
- You do?

12:42.931 --> 12:44.911
I do.

12:54.709 --> 12:57.830
This is where I think the tunnels are.

12:57.831 --> 13:00.782
Okay, and you think that because Valeria...

13:00.783 --> 13:02.483
- Told me.
- Okay.

13:02.484 --> 13:05.966
This is where they took the corpse
out down to the Park Hotel.

13:05.967 --> 13:08.351
Did you ever have blueprints
for this house, by any chance?

13:08.352 --> 13:10.514
- I never did.
- Okay.

13:10.515 --> 13:13.118
When I bought the house, I
checked out City Hall...

13:13.119 --> 13:16.607
To see if I could get a set of
blueprints, and they're completely gone.

13:16.608 --> 13:18.878
There's nothing showing any
kind of a tunnel or anything.

13:18.879 --> 13:20.803
- That's why...
- All the tunnels are unrecorded.

13:20.804 --> 13:22.018
Right.

13:22.019 --> 13:24.332
I'm having a hard time believing
everything I'm hearing,

13:24.333 --> 13:27.603
but I've heard stranger things
that turned out to be true.

13:27.604 --> 13:31.445
And since I can't disprove any of this,
I'm gonna continue the investigation

13:31.446 --> 13:34.582
and see if there's anything I can validate.

13:34.583 --> 13:37.583
(Eerie music playing)

13:46.722 --> 13:48.882
Oh, man.

13:53.588 --> 13:58.328
I really... I really don't like it in here.

14:02.043 --> 14:04.045
(Rubbing hands together)

14:04.046 --> 14:06.086
(Sighs)

14:08.216 --> 14:10.796
(Door creaking)

14:11.153 --> 14:13.154
(Scoffs)

14:13.155 --> 14:15.675
What is that?

14:15.885 --> 14:21.225
See, I'm wondering if the
floor could go down more.

14:21.531 --> 14:25.495
I see probably, like, a few people...

14:25.496 --> 14:28.769
Um, down in the ground further.

14:28.770 --> 14:31.350
I feel like...

14:31.762 --> 14:35.182
There's like, more down...

14:37.712 --> 14:40.892
Like a little cellar area.

14:40.893 --> 14:44.073
Or something like that.

14:51.359 --> 14:53.461
(Steve) After speaking with Kelly today,

14:53.462 --> 14:57.153
I'm having a problem trying
to prove any of this.

14:57.154 --> 14:59.188
Basically, it's hearsay.

14:59.189 --> 15:03.437
I need to start with something concrete,
so I'm gonna go look into the tunnels.

15:03.438 --> 15:05.072
I called a guy named Brad.

15:05.073 --> 15:09.010
He's gonna use some radar equipment to see
if there's any tunnels under the house.

15:09.011 --> 15:10.995
Basically, it sends a signal down,

15:10.996 --> 15:13.781
which then reflects off of
things in the subsurface.

15:13.782 --> 15:17.885
If there's a change in reflectivity,
like from a void space,

15:17.886 --> 15:23.724
the signal comes back up very distinctly
and records on the instrument.

15:23.725 --> 15:26.725
(Eerie music playing)

15:44.323 --> 15:47.023
(Buttons beeping)

15:58.990 --> 16:01.510
(Device beeps)

16:01.697 --> 16:04.517
(Beeping increases)

16:11.183 --> 16:13.109
Okay, so what's the verdict?

16:13.110 --> 16:16.619
There was some change in the fill material.

16:16.620 --> 16:21.002
So it's possible there could have been a
tunnel there that was then filled in later.

16:21.003 --> 16:23.738
Okay, Brad's test found
an area of the basement

16:23.739 --> 16:27.876
filled with different dirt from the
rest of it, so maybe Kelly's right.

16:27.877 --> 16:32.017
There could be a tunnel under there.

16:33.615 --> 16:36.495
(Heartbeat pounding)

16:43.425 --> 16:45.945
What is that?

16:48.890 --> 16:50.640
Big man.

16:50.641 --> 16:54.901
Doesn't want me back there.
Does not want me back there.

16:54.902 --> 16:55.979
He's like...

16:55.980 --> 16:58.910
(Voice echoing) Get outta here. Shut up.

16:58.911 --> 17:03.687
(Normal voice) And he's calling me some
names like, you [Bleep], blah blah blah.

17:03.688 --> 17:07.288
He's telling me to go away.

17:07.892 --> 17:10.657
- Can you see him?
- Yeah, he's a big guy.

17:10.659 --> 17:16.559
I don't know how he fits in there,
because he's bigger than the door.

17:19.228 --> 17:25.005
He's probably, like, 6-foot, and
he's, like, a real stocky guy.

17:25.006 --> 17:28.463
He's very protective of this area.

17:28.464 --> 17:32.364
He's yelling in my ear really...

17:33.709 --> 17:35.869
Stop it.

17:40.056 --> 17:41.856
Mm.

17:42.326 --> 17:44.334
He's like, uh, (Clicks lips)

17:44.335 --> 17:46.363
Stop it. (Gasps)

17:46.364 --> 17:49.424
(Indistinct whispering)

18:00.979 --> 18:03.381
(Amy) Walking through the
basement of this house,

18:03.382 --> 18:07.591
there's a large man who's blocking the
doorway and won't stop yelling at me.

18:07.592 --> 18:11.495
I think he's trying to stop me from
seeing what's in the back of that room.

18:11.496 --> 18:15.494
He's, like, retreating,
because I didn't leave.

18:15.495 --> 18:20.604
And, um, he doesn't really want
to give me any more information.

18:20.605 --> 18:23.154
Um, and he's just like,
just don't touch anything.

18:23.155 --> 18:26.575
Just don't touch anything.

18:33.216 --> 18:37.806
(Steve) I still don't know what
to make of this woman Kelly.

18:37.807 --> 18:40.724
She lives in a house built by
the founder of Great Falls,

18:40.725 --> 18:44.595
and she thinks his dead wife is
planting thoughts into her head.

18:44.596 --> 18:47.765
I'm gonna go talk to the guys who
did remodeling in the house.

18:47.766 --> 18:50.879
I'm gonna find out if their story
jives with what Kelly is telling me.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.947
Kelly told me you guys
did some work in there,

18:52.948 --> 18:55.473
and she said you had some
strange things happen.

18:55.474 --> 18:58.868
Um, one time, when we were working on
the trim work in the living room area,

18:58.869 --> 19:01.813
we heard this female voice
coming from the kitchen area.

19:01.814 --> 19:04.984
And I said, well, great, Kelly's here.
So we walk out there and,

19:04.985 --> 19:08.045
there's nobody there.

19:08.110 --> 19:11.086
All of a sudden, we hear
these footsteps upstairs.

19:11.087 --> 19:13.279
So I said, well, she must be upstairs.

19:13.280 --> 19:18.211
And so Mark runs upstairs, and he came
back and he goes, there's nobody there.

19:18.212 --> 19:22.054
There'd be times, uh, that he'd
be gone picking me up material,

19:22.055 --> 19:24.667
and, uh, I'd hear somebody talking.

19:24.668 --> 19:27.624
You know, it's full
conversation, a woman's voice.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.653
And I'm thinking, oh, great, they're back.

19:29.654 --> 19:31.598
I go out there to go see where he parked

19:31.599 --> 19:33.493
and grab my material, and
they're not even here.

19:33.494 --> 19:37.121
Nobody's here, you know.
It's just me and the house.

19:37.122 --> 19:39.367
(Steve) Now you guys won't
go back in the house, right?

19:39.368 --> 19:41.768
- No.
- No.

19:42.973 --> 19:45.973
(Eerie music playing)

19:50.580 --> 19:53.280
(Stairs creaking)

19:59.979 --> 20:05.879
This woman's saying, you know, I just
don't want any more of this going on.

20:06.232 --> 20:11.374
You know, I just want to sleep,
and I just want to relax.

20:11.375 --> 20:14.104
- Who's saying this?
- This lady.

20:14.105 --> 20:17.432
It's the same lady as...

20:17.433 --> 20:19.833
Downstairs...

20:20.318 --> 20:24.325
But she's kind of, like,
walking away from me.

20:24.326 --> 20:27.419
She thinks, you know, that we're evil.

20:27.420 --> 20:31.560
And, uh, that we shouldn't be here.

20:32.122 --> 20:33.966
These children...

20:33.967 --> 20:37.627
She's trying to protect them.

20:41.264 --> 20:45.276
She can't do the things
that she wants to do.

20:45.277 --> 20:48.805
Um, because there's all these
different people that come.

20:48.806 --> 20:54.578
And different things happening,
and they don't make sense to her.

20:54.579 --> 21:00.479
And, uh, she's gonna leave, because
she thinks that we're evil.

21:03.989 --> 21:07.357
(Steve) Since Kelly's convinced she's
seeing the ghost of Valeria Gibson.

21:07.358 --> 21:12.458
I need to find out more
about the Gibson family.

21:14.931 --> 21:17.721
Paris Gibson is legendary in Great Falls.

21:17.722 --> 21:20.307
He founded the city in 1883.

21:20.308 --> 21:25.259
You can't even spit in this town without
hitting something with his name on it.

21:25.260 --> 21:29.112
What's weird is, I can't
find much on Valeria.

21:29.113 --> 21:33.750
Not even solid evidence as to when
or if she ever lived in that house.

21:33.751 --> 21:36.612
She did have two sons...
Theodore and Philip...

21:36.613 --> 21:39.362
Who were both very involved
in Paris' business.

21:39.363 --> 21:43.927
And two other children that were born
before them but died at a very young age.

21:43.928 --> 21:48.601
But I can't find a single portrait or
picture of Valeria around this town.

21:48.602 --> 21:51.101
And that's a bit suspicious.

21:51.102 --> 21:54.102
(Eerie music playing)

21:58.642 --> 22:01.462
(Footsteps echoing)

22:03.814 --> 22:08.497
(Amy) I'm hearing a guy yell at
me that nobody wants me here.

22:08.498 --> 22:10.520
Okay, this is a very...

22:10.521 --> 22:12.921
Quiet group.

22:13.995 --> 22:15.959
They don't like outsiders.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.361
(Men speaking indistinctly)

22:18.362 --> 22:20.163
There are men.

22:20.164 --> 22:23.361
How are these men that
are around her related?

22:23.362 --> 22:26.602
I think they're family.

22:36.112 --> 22:39.068
There's something really...

22:39.069 --> 22:41.109
Foul...

22:41.552 --> 22:43.592
Foul...

22:46.039 --> 22:48.319
And nasty.

22:48.456 --> 22:50.436
And...

22:52.095 --> 22:56.045
I think someone who was a little...

22:56.046 --> 22:58.368
Mentally unstable.

22:58.369 --> 23:00.589
(Laughter)

23:00.832 --> 23:05.432
They're screaming. They're
screaming, we will hurt you.

23:05.433 --> 23:08.923
Don't think that we won't.

23:08.924 --> 23:11.984
(Indistinct whispering)

23:20.311 --> 23:23.311
(Eerie music playing)

23:27.788 --> 23:32.435
How are these men that
are around her related?

23:32.436 --> 23:34.529
Um, I think...

23:34.530 --> 23:37.170
They're family.

23:38.867 --> 23:42.947
I think someone who was a little...

23:43.200 --> 23:45.153
Mentally unstable.

23:45.154 --> 23:46.985
(Laughter)

23:46.986 --> 23:49.655
And it's so weird. Yeah, it's weird.

23:49.656 --> 23:54.431
They're screaming. They're
screaming, we will hurt you.

23:54.432 --> 23:57.972
Don't think that we won't.

24:03.135 --> 24:05.776
(Steve) Continuing my research
into the Gibson family,

24:05.777 --> 24:10.242
I read some disturbing things about Paris
Gibson's sons Theodore and Philip.

24:10.243 --> 24:12.849
Since Theodore also lived in
Kelly's house for quite a while,

24:12.850 --> 24:16.154
I'm meeting with a town historian to
get his thoughts on the two sons.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.695
Uh, do you know anything
about the sons themselves?

24:18.696 --> 24:24.366
In many ways, I think of the
two sons as good cop/bad cop.

24:24.367 --> 24:27.371
Philip was a toughie.

24:27.372 --> 24:31.952
He was in fights. He was
Paris Gibson's enforcer.

24:31.953 --> 24:37.853
Uh, Theodore was the good cop, and it was
almost like they were playing roles.

24:39.382 --> 24:42.382
(Eerie music playing)

24:50.463 --> 24:54.543
(Amy) Some guy was hitting the guy.

24:55.398 --> 24:57.758
Sometimes when I touch objects,

24:57.759 --> 25:01.927
my mind is flooded with the residual
imprint that lives within them.

25:01.928 --> 25:06.810
It's basically like opening up a
window to another point in time.

25:06.811 --> 25:10.531
Somebody hit him on his hands.

25:11.952 --> 25:15.099
The guy came up and just went, bam bam bam!

25:15.100 --> 25:19.660
And I think he broke some of his fingers.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.699
- The other guy was a nut job.
- (Matt) Which one?

25:22.700 --> 25:27.620
The one who's hitting
this other guy's hands.

25:27.997 --> 25:30.895
The guy was, like, just in shock.

25:30.896 --> 25:33.228
(Voice echoing) What's wrong with you?

25:33.229 --> 25:37.009
What... why are you doing that?

25:42.311 --> 25:47.171
Philip, uh, was sent to
Warm Springs, Montana.

25:47.174 --> 25:50.119
To the state mental hospital.

25:50.120 --> 25:54.791
The medical records say in his
case it was exhaustion of paresis,

25:54.792 --> 25:56.492
and that is a mental disorder.

25:56.493 --> 25:59.395
And he died in the mental hospital.

25:59.396 --> 26:03.310
Ironically, later the other son, Theodore.

26:03.311 --> 26:06.848
Suffered some similar mental problems.

26:06.849 --> 26:10.787
And he was sent to Warm Springs, as well.

26:10.788 --> 26:13.976
So both of her sons died in
the state mental hospital?

26:13.977 --> 26:16.617
That's correct.

26:18.127 --> 26:20.525
The other guy was just like...
(Laughs crazily)

26:20.526 --> 26:23.598
Like, he thought it was just funny.

26:23.599 --> 26:27.019
He was definitely unstable.

26:30.842 --> 26:34.634
(Steve) Now that I have some solid facts
about the Paris Gibson family home.

26:34.635 --> 26:40.399
It's time to find out more about the
house after the family died off.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.498
Kelly's neighbor Mark was born and
raised in the house next door,

26:43.499 --> 26:45.875
and has lived there for over 40 years.

26:45.876 --> 26:48.540
Mark, as I was talking to Kelly
about what's going on at her house,

26:48.541 --> 26:50.858
she said that...

26:50.859 --> 26:53.446
She thinks she's living with
the spirit of Valeria Gibson.

26:53.447 --> 26:55.141
What... what do you think about that?

26:55.142 --> 26:59.682
Um, yeah, actually, I think it's...
it's very possible.

26:59.683 --> 27:04.300
And the reason being is, uh, things
I've experienced over there myself.

27:04.301 --> 27:06.122
Now have you seen anything at her house?

27:06.123 --> 27:07.984
I haven't seen anything,
but I've felt things.

27:07.985 --> 27:11.585
Absolutely, I've felt things.

27:11.731 --> 27:14.034
I have felt threatened...

27:14.035 --> 27:18.719
Um, times where I would
not go in that house.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.970
Well, that's strange, because she has
a totally different outlook about it.

27:21.971 --> 27:23.760
She doesn't have any fear of it.

27:23.761 --> 27:27.030
It seemed that, um, whatever
was going on over there,

27:27.031 --> 27:30.511
it was focused towards men.

27:30.798 --> 27:34.398
She had workers that would...

27:34.482 --> 27:38.894
Have a lot of issues, hear a lot of
things, and refuse to go in her home.

27:38.895 --> 27:40.512
What do you know about her house?

27:40.513 --> 27:42.971
I've been born and raised in this
neighborhood, in this house,

27:42.972 --> 27:44.512
and I know quite a bit about it.

27:44.513 --> 27:49.252
A lot of these older homes were
converted into apartments.

27:49.253 --> 27:54.176
Kelly's home was, um, turned
into a renter or boardinghouse.

27:54.177 --> 27:56.360
What kind of, uh, people were living here?

27:56.361 --> 27:59.463
In the early years, when they first
started, it was military personnel.

27:59.464 --> 28:01.483
In Kelly's place, it was
a little different.

28:01.484 --> 28:05.186
The people that were renting
exclusively over at...

28:05.187 --> 28:08.288
The Gibson home were...

28:08.289 --> 28:10.890
Mentally challenged.

28:10.891 --> 28:14.445
People that were out of,
um, an institution.

28:14.446 --> 28:15.767
- Really?
- Yes.

28:15.768 --> 28:19.124
The owner that I remember as growing up.

28:19.125 --> 28:20.710
He...

28:20.711 --> 28:23.311
He went insane.

28:23.312 --> 28:27.358
But I do remember him being
escorted out of his home.

28:27.359 --> 28:30.027
And I... that's what I remember,
sitting on the front porch,

28:30.028 --> 28:33.270
watching him being taken out...

28:33.271 --> 28:35.837
Literally in a white straitjacket.

28:35.838 --> 28:40.504
It was... it was a big ordeal,
and it was a spectacle.

28:40.505 --> 28:46.405
I mean, he was taken to Warm
Springs after living in that home.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.129
(Steve) So let me get this straight...

28:49.130 --> 28:52.650
This guy that used to own the Gibson
house wound up in a mental hospital?

28:52.651 --> 28:55.342
Paris Gibson's kids, too?

28:55.343 --> 29:00.191
If Kelly's having a mental breakdown, she
wouldn't be the first one in this house.

29:00.192 --> 29:03.192
(Eerie music playing)

29:13.237 --> 29:17.317
Man, I am getting a lot of people.

29:17.970 --> 29:23.126
When I first walked into this house, the
amount of activity I saw was pretty normal.

29:23.127 --> 29:26.350
But the longer I stay here,
the more I feel consumed

29:26.351 --> 29:30.300
by the abnormal amount of the
dead vying for my attention.

29:30.301 --> 29:35.521
There's a lot of, uh, of
people coming and going.

29:37.061 --> 29:42.034
I mean, there's more than,
uh, would be normal...

29:42.035 --> 29:44.555
In the house.

29:45.626 --> 29:47.666
(Sighs)

29:50.264 --> 29:53.684
What is with these people?

29:54.327 --> 29:57.087
It's just weird.

29:58.908 --> 30:01.629
And there's so much, uh...

30:01.630 --> 30:04.105
Sadness, uh...

30:04.106 --> 30:06.135
(Groans)

30:06.136 --> 30:09.256
And illness and, uh...

30:10.073 --> 30:15.973
Yeah, lots of people, like,
climbing in and out of the windows.

30:16.569 --> 30:22.469
And then people who don't want
to talk, who are taunting us.

30:22.598 --> 30:27.458
We have one who's having
psychological issues.

30:28.084 --> 30:33.904
And one who doesn't like us,
because we're not from here.

30:34.442 --> 30:38.679
(Amy) Is this really
happening, or am I crazy?

30:38.680 --> 30:41.740
(Indistinct whispering)

30:49.229 --> 30:52.229
(Eerie music playing)

31:06.253 --> 31:09.168
Now that Amy and I have finished
with our investigation,

31:09.169 --> 31:13.542
this is the first time we'll be
hearing each other's findings.

31:13.543 --> 31:16.457
Kelly's a little on edge about
what we're gonna reveal,

31:16.458 --> 31:19.744
so she asked her neighbor Mark to
join her for some moral support.

31:19.745 --> 31:21.335
He reluctantly agreed.

31:21.336 --> 31:24.902
The reason we were called in is
Kelly's had some issues in the house.

31:24.903 --> 31:27.749
I'd like Kelly to now tell
you about her interactions.

31:27.750 --> 31:29.771
(Kelly) A year and a half
ago, I bought this house.

31:29.772 --> 31:33.378
And Paris Gibson was the founder of
Great Falls, and this was his house.

31:33.379 --> 31:37.615
And, um, he lived here
with his wife Valeria.

31:37.616 --> 31:42.053
And I've been communicating with a
woman for the past year and a half.

31:42.054 --> 31:44.616
And I believe that it's Valeria.

31:44.617 --> 31:49.327
I would like to know if I am totally crazy.

31:49.328 --> 31:51.486
Well, you're not crazy.

31:51.487 --> 31:55.267
Um, I encountered a woman here.

31:55.528 --> 31:57.064
Wow.

31:57.065 --> 32:01.096
When I came in, she was the
first person I connected with.

32:01.097 --> 32:04.675
And had two children that she
was protecting with her.

32:04.676 --> 32:08.117
She thinks, you know, that we're evil.

32:08.118 --> 32:11.742
And, uh, that we shouldn't be here.

32:11.743 --> 32:13.844
These children...

32:13.845 --> 32:17.117
She's trying to protect them.

32:17.118 --> 32:20.584
During my background investigation, I
found out that Valeria had four children.

32:20.585 --> 32:22.748
Two of them actually died
at a very young age.

32:22.749 --> 32:25.315
One was 1, and one was 2.

32:25.316 --> 32:27.954
Um, well, I know she was protecting them.

32:27.955 --> 32:30.086
She wouldn't let me
interact with them at all.

32:30.087 --> 32:33.496
She wouldn't let me see them,
so that there would be no,

32:33.497 --> 32:35.120
interaction with the children.

32:35.121 --> 32:38.659
Because she wanted to protect
them as much as possible.

32:38.660 --> 32:40.398
And...

32:40.399 --> 32:43.166
She's surrounded by a lot of men.

32:43.167 --> 32:46.111
And it was hard to communicate with her,

32:46.112 --> 32:49.297
because the men didn't
want her to talk to me.

32:49.298 --> 32:51.953
And they were kind of
making her feel guilty.

32:51.954 --> 32:57.359
And she felt, um, that communicating
with me might be evil.

32:57.360 --> 33:00.393
Kelly, tell her the story
that you relayed to me

33:00.394 --> 33:03.001
about what you think
might have went on here.

33:03.002 --> 33:05.234
Well, Valeria Gibson...

33:05.235 --> 33:08.329
I feel, I guess, that she's
a very intelligent woman.

33:08.330 --> 33:11.541
And very outspoken, but she couldn't speak.

33:11.542 --> 33:14.092
She was repressed.

33:14.093 --> 33:17.095
She was not allowed to...

33:17.096 --> 33:18.990
To talk about anything.

33:18.991 --> 33:21.271
And she...

33:22.722 --> 33:28.045
Has sort of communicated to me that a lot
of bad things have happened in this house.

33:28.046 --> 33:31.826
And that those men were responsible
for a lot of very bad things.

33:31.827 --> 33:35.454
Yes, I would agree with that 100%.

33:35.455 --> 33:38.035
Um, in fact...

33:38.465 --> 33:41.281
I did get her death.

33:41.282 --> 33:46.861
I did see her running and
possibly falling down the stairs.

33:46.862 --> 33:49.968
(Amy) She's, like, running up the stairs.

33:49.969 --> 33:53.164
She's falling back down.

33:53.165 --> 33:56.825
Oh, I think she got murdered.

33:57.117 --> 33:59.404
I felt like her death was not natural.

33:59.405 --> 34:02.024
It... it was a murder.

34:02.025 --> 34:04.176
I... wow. Wow.

34:04.177 --> 34:06.893
Because that's exactly
what I said to Steve.

34:06.894 --> 34:09.911
What she's communicated to me...

34:09.913 --> 34:11.714
Wow, um...

34:11.715 --> 34:16.752
Is that she was pushed down the
third-floor staircase and broke her neck.

34:16.753 --> 34:18.914
- Wow.
- Mm hmm.

34:18.915 --> 34:21.500
And the... the newspapers had reported...

34:21.501 --> 34:24.070
That she fell off the Park Hotel.

34:24.071 --> 34:28.083
But that was not what happened.
She was murdered here.

34:28.085 --> 34:31.498
(Steve) The odd thing about it, there's not
much, I mean, there's newspaper articles.

34:31.498 --> 34:35.993
There's only two. One says she
died accidentally from a fall.

34:35.994 --> 34:38.853
And the other one just says she died.
They're contradicting.

34:38.853 --> 34:40.386
Mm-hmm.

34:40.387 --> 34:44.639
To top it all off, the death certificate
was signed off on, which I have.

34:44.641 --> 34:47.208
And it said that it was
an accidental death.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.190
But...

34:49.666 --> 34:52.250
That's it... just accidental.

34:52.251 --> 34:57.388
And it was actually signed off on by her
brother-in-law, her sister's husband.

34:57.389 --> 35:00.492
When you look at the facts
surrounding Valeria's death.

35:00.493 --> 35:03.217
A lot of fingers point
towards the Gibson family.

35:03.218 --> 35:06.068
Kelly might be on to
something, it's very possible,

35:06.069 --> 35:08.540
this could have been
some kind of a cover-up.

35:08.541 --> 35:11.894
She was transported through the
underground tunnel from this house,

35:11.895 --> 35:14.063
to the Park Hotel.

35:14.064 --> 35:17.298
And she... her body was dumped off.

35:17.299 --> 35:19.464
Wow. Okay.

35:19.465 --> 35:22.268
And that's what I told Steve.

35:22.269 --> 35:27.215
Amy, I saw the look on your face when
Kelly mentioned the underground tunnels.

35:27.216 --> 35:30.559
Um, what I can recall is that...

35:30.560 --> 35:34.452
I was in the basement, and I
wanted to go down further,

35:34.453 --> 35:36.890
which made no sense to me at the time.

35:36.891 --> 35:40.218
It was kind of a little frustrating.

35:40.219 --> 35:43.111
I feel like there's, like..

35:43.112 --> 35:44.911
More down.

35:44.912 --> 35:48.332
Like a little cellar area.

35:49.071 --> 35:50.889
When Kelly mentioned about the tunnels,

35:50.890 --> 35:55.034
I called in a guy, Brad, and he used a
system called ground-penetrating radar.

35:55.035 --> 35:57.027
They do a lot of this
testing around here for

35:57.028 --> 35:58.938
- old mine shafts and stuff like that.
- Oh.

35:58.939 --> 36:01.440
So I had him do a test here.

36:01.441 --> 36:04.235
Um, he didn't find any tunnels,

36:04.236 --> 36:06.593
but what he did find was, uh...

36:06.594 --> 36:11.183
Areas where it looked like there may
have been tunnels that were filled in.

36:11.184 --> 36:13.729
- They've been filled in.
- How do you know that?

36:13.730 --> 36:17.056
I don't know. I can't tell you that.
I just know it.

36:17.057 --> 36:20.229
Because you can't tell when you go down
there that there's anything at all.

36:20.230 --> 36:21.237
Right, I know.

36:21.238 --> 36:23.124
- Mark and I have talked about this...
- Yeah.

36:23.125 --> 36:25.443
And I'm like, I have to get in this tunnel.

36:25.444 --> 36:27.332
I have to get in this tunnel.

36:27.333 --> 36:31.506
Right. I understand that feeling totally.

36:31.507 --> 36:34.567
(Indistinct whispering)

36:35.557 --> 36:39.957
One of the things that uh,
I did get as well, was...

36:39.958 --> 36:43.618
Something about, uh, five men.

36:44.606 --> 36:46.159
And two of the men were...

36:46.160 --> 36:49.280
Were unstable mentally.

36:51.573 --> 36:55.398
(Amy) Some guy was hitting the guy.

36:55.399 --> 36:58.513
The guy came up and just went, bam bam bam!

36:58.514 --> 37:01.482
And I think he broke some of his fingers.

37:01.483 --> 37:04.423
Guy was a nut job.

37:05.165 --> 37:08.290
Well, when I was speaking with
Ken, the historian in town.

37:08.291 --> 37:13.527
He mentioned that the son Philip was
the muscle for the father, so...

37:13.528 --> 37:16.348
Is he still here?

37:18.166 --> 37:20.026
Yes.

37:21.937 --> 37:24.997
(Indistinct whispering)

37:37.594 --> 37:39.958
Is he still here?

37:39.959 --> 37:41.624
Yes.

37:41.625 --> 37:46.462
But he came in from outside,
and so he's not in the house.

37:46.463 --> 37:49.943
He's outside of the house.

37:50.092 --> 37:54.036
Well, it turns out that both the sons,
Theodore and Philip, went insane.

37:54.037 --> 37:55.028
(Gasps)

37:55.029 --> 37:56.287
Oh, my.

37:56.288 --> 37:59.047
And I got Theodore's
death certificate here,

37:59.048 --> 38:04.748
and it says exhaustion of general
paralysis of the insane.

38:04.938 --> 38:08.569
Philip went insane, also, according to the
documentation on his death certificate.

38:08.570 --> 38:11.157
Exhaustion of para... same thing... insane.

38:11.158 --> 38:12.826
Wow.

38:12.827 --> 38:15.665
The most frustrating thing
about this case for me...

38:15.666 --> 38:19.867
There's nothing about Valeria anywhere.
There's no portraits. There's no pictures.

38:19.868 --> 38:21.730
Apparently somebody wanted
her to be anonymous.

38:21.731 --> 38:23.673
Why is there no documentation on her?

38:23.674 --> 38:25.326
- Right.
- Why are there no photos of her?

38:25.327 --> 38:28.644
I don't get that. An
influential man like that...

38:28.645 --> 38:32.390
You would think the woman he's married
to, there would be something about her.

38:32.391 --> 38:34.541
- Yeah.
- I think she'd become a problem.

38:34.542 --> 38:37.425
Because of their stature in this town.

38:37.426 --> 38:42.025
Her murder needed to be just wiped
off the face of history, really.

38:42.026 --> 38:43.517
- Excuses.
- Well, that's the whole...

38:43.518 --> 38:47.594
The suppression and how she was
treated, which is horribly, so...

38:47.595 --> 38:50.838
Do you think the woman you saw
is the same woman she saw?

38:50.839 --> 38:53.196
I don't know. She didn't
tell me who she was.

38:53.197 --> 38:58.474
There was no opportunity, really, um,
just because of the men coming in.

38:58.475 --> 39:01.844
- She's in the house.
- She's guarding this house.

39:01.845 --> 39:04.251
- Yeah.
- This was her house.

39:04.252 --> 39:08.184
The woman in this house stayed
behind for a very specific reason.

39:08.185 --> 39:10.704
To guard the spirits of
these two young children,

39:10.705 --> 39:13.410
from all of the insanity around them.

39:13.411 --> 39:15.993
Kelly, explain to her what you
were talking with me about,

39:15.994 --> 39:17.497
the ink bottle you found here.

39:17.498 --> 39:19.001
And you said something about a diary.

39:19.002 --> 39:22.925
There's a diary. There's some
documentation that's written down...

39:22.926 --> 39:26.484
Somewhere in this house of
what happened to Valeria.

39:26.485 --> 39:31.285
But I cannot find it.
This just tortures me.

39:31.300 --> 39:34.081
Somebody's putting stuff in there.

39:34.082 --> 39:37.691
(Matt) What kind of stuff
are they putting in there?

39:37.692 --> 39:39.672
Books.

39:41.075 --> 39:43.300
I kind of saw like,

39:43.301 --> 39:47.104
her putting a little box in
there or books in there.

39:47.105 --> 39:50.313
She told me I needed to tear the
wall out to find the inkwell.

39:50.314 --> 39:52.896
I mean, I didn't even know it was there.

39:52.897 --> 39:56.151
Kelly, you just wake up sometimes
and you know things. Is that right?

39:56.152 --> 39:57.280
That's how she talks to me.

39:57.281 --> 39:58.969
- It's at night in my dreams.
- Right.

39:58.970 --> 40:02.204
I just know these things, and
I'm like, this is crazy.

40:02.205 --> 40:05.304
Um, you know, when you're
asleep is the easiest

40:05.305 --> 40:08.113
time for them to communicate with you.

40:08.114 --> 40:13.449
Because the brain is actually the
most active when we're asleep.

40:13.450 --> 40:16.986
Which may mean that it's so active,

40:16.987 --> 40:22.887
that it's actually open to receiving
the information from the dead.

40:24.029 --> 40:26.529
The other thing about the houses here...

40:26.530 --> 40:28.392
Uh, they made 'em into boardinghouses.

40:28.393 --> 40:31.191
So you had a lot of transient
occupants coming in and out of here.

40:31.192 --> 40:35.349
Mm-hmm. I got a lot of different stories.

40:35.350 --> 40:38.167
Why is there such a heavy feeling
or dark feeling still there?

40:38.168 --> 40:41.393
Sometimes a location will hold on to...

40:41.394 --> 40:45.388
Very traumatic, major
events that have occurred.

40:45.389 --> 40:48.278
That leave an imprint on the location.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.233
Is there anything that would help...

40:51.234 --> 40:54.824
Prove what we're talking about.

40:54.825 --> 40:59.625
Valeria's death... I
mean, is there anything?

40:59.662 --> 41:03.358
I really wish I could find more
evidence to support these theories.

41:03.359 --> 41:04.967
It seems very possible.

41:04.968 --> 41:09.151
The answers we're looking for
could be somewhere in this house.

41:09.152 --> 41:14.310
The main thing that the dead typically
want us to do is to tell their stories.

41:14.311 --> 41:17.121
I've been in positions where I've
had to tell the dead's story,

41:17.122 --> 41:20.568
and some people didn't
react very well to it.

41:20.569 --> 41:26.184
Um, so you do have to be careful about
how you go about it in some situations.

41:26.185 --> 41:30.743
(Amy) Kelly is communicating with a female
apparition on a very primitive level.

41:30.744 --> 41:33.991
With time, she can learn how
to hone her abilities...

41:33.992 --> 41:38.061
And establish a direct line of
communication with the spirit.

41:38.062 --> 41:41.173
If you want to, um, hear them out.

41:41.174 --> 41:43.439
Before you go to sleep
you could say, you know,

41:43.440 --> 41:46.376
it's okay to come and talk to me.

41:46.377 --> 41:48.501
Not through me.

41:48.502 --> 41:52.648
And show... you know, through my
dreams you can tell me your story.

41:52.649 --> 41:55.576
- It'll help them.
- That's amazing.

41:55.577 --> 41:57.411
I mean, it's just amazing,

41:57.412 --> 42:00.929
because it's not something that I
can really tell very many people.

42:00.930 --> 42:02.749
- I mean, Mark knows.
- Right.

42:02.750 --> 42:06.345
But that's not something you can actually,
like, have a complete conversation with,

42:06.346 --> 42:09.064
because they think you're a raging lunatic.

42:09.065 --> 42:11.045
Right.

42:12.071 --> 42:13.861
Thank you.
