00:00.242 --> 00:01.991
Felix, get your father.

00:03.843 --> 00:06.438
- How did it go at the doctor's?
- What's your problem?

00:06.439 --> 00:09.446
Oscar can walk, but my family
can't remember me.

00:09.447 --> 00:11.009
Jake, son.

00:11.034 --> 00:14.411
<i>It's not just that we've been forgotten.
There are whole new lives.</i>

00:14.412 --> 00:16.434
Like a different version
of the same reality.

00:16.459 --> 00:18.365
- Mum!
- I don't have a son.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.790
Are you that nut job
who came to my house yesterday?

00:20.798 --> 00:22.915
What are you doing
talking to my girlfriend?

00:22.940 --> 00:24.183
<i>Run, stalker!</i>

00:24.989 --> 00:26.762
<i>It was no storm.</i>

00:26.763 --> 00:29.692
<i>I think there might be forces at play
which we don't understand.</i>

00:29.896 --> 00:31.787
<i>She was that creepy woman
from the forest.</i>

00:31.812 --> 00:33.198
<i>Where'd you get that from?</i>

00:33.223 --> 00:36.296
- Adults only.
- The amulet picks you.

00:36.321 --> 00:38.155
Hey, watch out!

00:40.976 --> 00:42.976
You just saved my life.

Season 1, Episode 5

01:29.606 --> 01:32.606
Subbed by Reef
www.addic7ed.com

01:49.595 --> 01:53.417
It is so cool up here, Oscar.
You can see the whole of Bremin.

01:55.519 --> 01:57.377
Just a little bit further.

02:02.214 --> 02:06.457
- Come on, Oskie, what are you scared of?
- I'm not "scared".

02:13.565 --> 02:14.946
<i>Felix...!</i>

02:17.149 --> 02:18.605
- Aah...!
- Oscar, no!

02:21.636 --> 02:23.179
<i>My baby...</i>

02:25.537 --> 02:26.949
My baby...

02:31.219 --> 02:33.823
My poor baby boy...

02:37.917 --> 02:40.244
He's my baby...

02:48.416 --> 02:50.199
<i>This porridge is gross.</i>

02:51.075 --> 02:54.715
- Oh, poor baby...
- But it's not even cooked.

02:54.740 --> 02:57.617
Harden up, Andy, porridge
is the breakfast of champions.

02:57.654 --> 02:59.887
Oh, a little food movement, cool!

03:04.966 --> 03:07.084
- There's nothing left.
- You snooze, you lose.

03:07.085 --> 03:10.003
- Thanks a lot, so-called friends.
- You're welcome, freak.

03:10.028 --> 03:12.028
Will you stop calling me "freak"?

03:12.380 --> 03:13.808
No.

03:15.973 --> 03:17.806
I thought freakiness was his thing.

03:18.871 --> 03:21.747
- Do we have toilet paper?
- Dude, we don't even have a toilet.

03:35.620 --> 03:37.799
Hey, Oscar, just coming...

03:38.575 --> 03:40.018
...To see you.

03:43.661 --> 03:46.807
You know...
When you run away from <i>us</i>...

03:46.832 --> 03:48.832
Really hurts our feelings.

03:49.223 --> 03:50.971
- Doesn't it, Dyl'?
- Yeah.

03:52.487 --> 03:54.314
Would you look at that...

03:54.776 --> 03:57.233
The weiner has a little toy.

03:57.538 --> 03:58.807
Please don't...

03:59.883 --> 04:03.505
- Please, don't break it.
- Come on, guys, just... leave him alone.

04:03.928 --> 04:05.452
Do you like it, Dyl'?

04:05.477 --> 04:07.139
- No.
- No...?

04:10.781 --> 04:13.337
It's what you get for being
such a freak in front of us.

04:13.362 --> 04:14.896
Don't call him a freak!

04:17.596 --> 04:20.512
- Get off!
- Run, Oscar, run!

04:24.389 --> 04:27.292
Well, I think we can all agree
that was unexpected...

04:27.426 --> 04:29.426
Now, if you’ll just excuse me...

04:38.841 --> 04:42.019
This is a terrible idea.
We should be lying low.

04:42.044 --> 04:44.117
No, no, no, no,
we impress a few people,

04:44.118 --> 04:47.032
elevate our social status,
and then it's "good bye scavenging".

04:47.033 --> 04:49.230
People'll be lining up
to invite us to dinner.

04:49.255 --> 04:52.133
You know, speaking of jobs,
we could try making some cash.

04:52.158 --> 04:53.878
Way ahead of you, big man...

04:53.911 --> 04:57.257
Hello, Bremin.
Prepare to fall in love with me.

04:57.282 --> 04:58.808
Again.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.043
Fascinating.

05:02.505 --> 05:05.273
It's like he's the president
of his own fan club.

05:07.789 --> 05:09.734
___

05:10.983 --> 05:12.824
___

05:20.996 --> 05:22.419
Jake...

05:26.951 --> 05:29.146
First, I will lure them in.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.153
Fearlessly acting as bait.

05:31.178 --> 05:33.625
Then, when Trent and Dylan attack,

05:33.670 --> 05:36.461
the Trenite mothership
will close in from behind

05:36.486 --> 05:38.092
and squash their heads!

05:38.117 --> 05:39.329
- And...
- Oscar!

05:39.354 --> 05:42.589
Oscar... Just bringing
back your thingy.

05:46.074 --> 05:49.346
Before you appeared,
I was number four

05:49.347 --> 05:52.596
on Trent's and Dylan's bully list
and now I'm like two.

05:52.621 --> 05:56.706
In front of Mike Parker.
He brings a stuffed unicorn to school.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.353
A unicorn...

05:58.378 --> 06:01.299
- But you needed help.
- I needed to be left alone.

06:01.324 --> 06:03.204
Yeah, that was working out well
for you.

06:03.346 --> 06:05.170
Ah, just go away!

06:07.937 --> 06:09.827
And what if I don't?

06:10.813 --> 06:12.578
What if I stay here?

06:12.665 --> 06:15.728
Pitch at little Teepee
and use his litter box as a toilet.

06:15.753 --> 06:18.352
What if everybody here's
about to freak in the front yard,

06:18.377 --> 06:19.902
when I tell them
we're BFFs.

06:19.927 --> 06:21.566
Only girls say "BFFs".

06:21.591 --> 06:25.130
Then you'll be known as the friend
of the girlie front yard freak.

06:25.334 --> 06:27.042
And that'll make you...

06:27.683 --> 06:29.787
Number one on the list.

06:31.499 --> 06:33.783
I see you invest a lot
in the blackmail.

06:34.021 --> 06:35.247
Yeah...

06:35.272 --> 06:37.660
I also overheard you
talking to yourself.

06:37.661 --> 06:40.941
- I wasn't talking to myself.
- Then who were you talking to?

06:43.302 --> 06:45.882
<i>His name...
Is Centaurus the Deadly.</i>

06:45.945 --> 06:48.258
<i>Warrior outcast
of the Saurus Trap.</i>

06:48.283 --> 06:51.916
"Warrior outcast"...
Very Metal.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.876
It's different than how I had it.
I mean, <i>would... have it</i>.

06:56.877 --> 06:59.214
Why is it that you wanna
hang out with me so much?

06:59.215 --> 07:02.351
- It's weird.
- I think we could be a good team.

07:03.032 --> 07:04.579
We're similar.

07:05.415 --> 07:07.236
<i>I don't see
any similarities.</i>

07:07.262 --> 07:11.371
- You must really love that magazine.
- No... I have to cut out the coupons.

07:11.396 --> 07:15.506
Twenty equals <i>one</i> of the Walterian
cruisers that was obliterated today.

07:15.531 --> 07:17.755
- Because of <i>you</i>.
- You know, if I helped...

07:17.780 --> 07:19.665
We could get it done
in half the time.

07:37.940 --> 07:39.392
<i>Oscar!</i>

07:42.987 --> 07:45.180
Oscar? I know
you're in there.

07:45.205 --> 07:47.500
Can't people tell
that <i>I'm working</i> here...?

07:49.421 --> 07:51.563
Oh, the beast
has left the swamp.

07:51.564 --> 07:55.352
Look, this is serious.
My dog, Wikileaks, is missing.

07:55.377 --> 07:57.545
Look, I'd love to help,
I'd really would, but...

07:57.570 --> 08:00.485
I... I'm too busy, you know?
Not... caring.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.071
- You...
- You remember me!

08:06.096 --> 08:08.278
You were with the guy
from the bus.

08:08.935 --> 08:11.863
- He saved my life.
- I can help you look for Wikileaks.

08:11.888 --> 08:13.888
He's more like
little running faeces.

08:13.913 --> 08:17.603
You... What did you say
your friend's name was, again?

08:17.628 --> 08:19.744
I didn't.
It's Andy.

08:20.238 --> 08:21.811
Andy...

08:22.391 --> 08:25.398
Tell him...
"Ellen says hi".

08:25.423 --> 08:28.109
- And I'm Felix.
- Yeah... Sure.

08:29.579 --> 08:32.311
More friends, Oscar...
Mr. Popular!

08:32.336 --> 08:37.371
Mum... please, go back in the house.
And... <i>she</i> is not my friend.

08:37.654 --> 08:40.082
- I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name.
- I'm Felix.

08:40.107 --> 08:42.107
You have a lovely home, Mrs. Finn.

08:42.133 --> 08:44.133
Thank you, Felix.

08:44.837 --> 08:46.472
Sorry, must be hay fever.

08:47.768 --> 08:50.353
Oh! I think I'll have
antihistamines.

08:50.745 --> 08:52.927
You know, you should
come here more often, Felix.

08:53.030 --> 08:56.369
Wouldn't it be wonderful, Oscar?
I'm just ducking to the chemist.

08:56.432 --> 08:58.291
Have fun, boys.

09:01.526 --> 09:05.486
Blackmail and toadying...
You are formidable.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.237
Hi...

09:19.567 --> 09:21.451
How can I help you...

09:21.554 --> 09:24.100
Uhm... my Dad and I
are moving here...?

09:24.125 --> 09:29.431
Uhm, to Bremin, and he... sent me in
to have a look at some houses to rent.

09:29.456 --> 09:31.932
- Your dad sent you here...?
- Yeah.

09:32.129 --> 09:35.326
And did your dad send you
round to my house, too?

09:35.382 --> 09:39.932
Oh, yeah, sorry, that was a... That was
a dare. A friend of mine dared me.

09:39.957 --> 09:42.261
A friend of yours dared you
to go to a complete stranger

09:42.262 --> 09:44.333
and call her...
your mother.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.536
Yep.

09:45.795 --> 09:49.314
- Well, you have strange friends.
- Yeah, not by choice.

09:49.424 --> 09:52.344
All right, so, what sort of property
are we looking at?

09:52.415 --> 09:54.911
Uhm... A proper house,
something big...

09:54.937 --> 09:56.997
- Mhm...
- View to the river...

09:57.295 --> 09:59.127
With a big backyard...

10:03.839 --> 10:05.775
You like the Bremin bandicoots.

10:06.112 --> 10:09.685
- I love the bandicoots, yes.
- I love the bandicoots, too...

10:09.865 --> 10:12.414
I mean, I will,
when I get here.

10:12.439 --> 10:14.910
Obviously, I don't yet,
because I'm new, but...

10:14.935 --> 10:17.386
- I'm sure I will.
- It could be hard being new.

10:17.917 --> 10:20.361
Especially when you miss
people from back home.

10:22.373 --> 10:24.531
All right, now, I've a few ideas,
here, look.

10:27.100 --> 10:30.486
- Are you okay?
- No, my head is killing me.

10:30.620 --> 10:32.620
- Ooh...
- You never get headaches.

10:32.902 --> 10:35.482
No, I don't...
Oh, okay.

10:35.483 --> 10:37.610
Do you want me to get you
some painkillers...?

10:37.611 --> 10:39.188
No, it's all right, I'll be fine.

10:39.189 --> 10:41.702
You just stay here, I'll be back
in a minute, all right?

10:42.383 --> 10:46.081
Thank you for the coupon assistance.
Now... goodbye and have a...

10:46.082 --> 10:47.939
Long and productive life.

10:48.174 --> 10:51.962
What... You gonna give me
a gold star and send me on my way?

11:01.424 --> 11:04.229
Oscar... We have to go inside.
Now.

11:04.230 --> 11:05.855
- Yes, we do.
- Run!

11:08.988 --> 11:10.994
Things like this keep happening.

11:11.066 --> 11:14.458
Weird weather, creepy things
that go bang in the night...

11:14.530 --> 11:16.600
Now, crazy bees!

11:24.499 --> 11:26.135
<i>Be gone!</i>

11:26.745 --> 11:30.021
Behold, the repelling power
of the crystals!

11:36.068 --> 11:38.250
You think I'm insane,
don't you...

11:39.400 --> 11:43.206
There are 23 different alien species
living among us right now.

11:43.582 --> 11:45.466
Communicating via telepathy.

11:45.537 --> 11:48.329
Maybe you're one of them.
The bees can tell.

11:48.643 --> 11:51.772
- We have to get help.
- "We"...? You have to get help.

11:51.805 --> 11:55.177
- I will stay here, make a sandwich.
- You want to be stuck here with them?

11:55.412 --> 11:56.857
What if they get in here?

11:56.882 --> 12:01.224
Can you imagine what it'd be like to be
killed by ten thousand of these things?

12:01.874 --> 12:03.642
Excruciating.

12:04.619 --> 12:07.397
Lucky my Mum is mental
about insects.

12:10.382 --> 12:13.128
Apparently, these are much better
at protecting us from bees.

12:13.153 --> 12:14.853
- You got any more?
- Yeah...

12:17.682 --> 12:19.842
Okay. The enemy
are at the front.

12:19.867 --> 12:22.378
So we need to take
the secret escape route.

12:22.574 --> 12:24.008
Through the neighbour’s yard.

12:24.033 --> 12:26.278
How do you know about
the secret escape route?

12:27.748 --> 12:29.579
Whoa, telepathy...!

12:43.310 --> 12:46.446
All righty, generously
to a skater in need.

12:46.525 --> 12:49.059
<i>I'll be here all day.
Okay?</i>

12:49.295 --> 12:52.232
Hey, don't forget.
I do requests.

12:52.694 --> 12:54.236
Anyone...?

12:55.479 --> 12:57.956
It was him.
He broke into our house.

12:57.981 --> 13:01.016
- I thought it was a mate's place.
- Ow, come on!

13:01.621 --> 13:04.160
There was a break and enter
at Bremin High last weekend.

13:04.185 --> 13:06.114
- You know anything about that?
- No.

13:06.177 --> 13:08.663
- You from around here?
- No.

13:09.945 --> 13:12.631
- So what are you doing here?
- Holiday.

13:12.922 --> 13:15.057
- In Bremin...
- Yes.

13:16.597 --> 13:18.408
Nice skating on the footpath.

13:18.643 --> 13:22.183
Let that be your first
and final warning, okay?

13:27.959 --> 13:30.005
You skate like a gimp.

13:34.131 --> 13:35.479
Great.

13:38.896 --> 13:42.387
Quite an entrance...
Who do you try to scam today?

13:43.060 --> 13:44.940
- Useless.
- I could have told you that.

13:44.941 --> 13:47.937
- I need the book.
- The book you stole from my store room?

13:47.962 --> 13:51.030
I borrowed it!
For... half a minute.

13:51.055 --> 13:53.844
I-I think he's an alien.
He's got telepathy.

13:53.869 --> 13:55.254
Really...?

13:55.373 --> 13:58.506
- What am I thinking?
- You're thinking...

13:58.929 --> 14:02.470
I hate teenage boys and I wish
they would stop coming into my shop.

14:04.369 --> 14:06.011
Close enough.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.616
Are you Andy?

14:25.922 --> 14:27.767
My mission was to deliver this.

14:29.511 --> 14:31.713
- What is that?
- Lavender...?

14:33.121 --> 14:38.122
"U plus M to the power of <i>e</i>
equals heart symbol"...?

14:38.592 --> 14:42.331
- What's "M to the power of <i>e</i>"?
- It's "You plus me equals love".

14:42.356 --> 14:43.621
But not as in <i>me</i>.

14:43.646 --> 14:45.550
- Who's it from?
- That's a secret.

14:48.387 --> 14:51.778
This is the second strangest thing
that's ever happened to me.

14:55.430 --> 14:58.369
You sure you didn't just...
Disturb their hive?

14:58.394 --> 15:01.974
No. They chased us into the house,
and then, here.

15:01.999 --> 15:05.651
And before that, there was
this strange, hellish storm.

15:05.676 --> 15:08.534
- Hmm. Elemental attacks.
- What are they?

15:08.535 --> 15:10.784
Earth, Fire,
Water and Air

15:10.785 --> 15:13.167
are the building blocks of
everything that we know,

15:13.168 --> 15:17.460
and for some reason, they appear
hell-bent on ruining your day.

15:18.430 --> 15:23.304
Most of the people that come into
my shop are after scented candles and...

15:23.548 --> 15:26.396
Dolphin statues,
but you're different, Felix.

15:26.648 --> 15:28.291
You're the real thing?

15:28.817 --> 15:30.760
Will you help me
if I am?

15:32.457 --> 15:33.768
Then, yes.

15:39.050 --> 15:40.900
This is very special.

15:41.221 --> 15:43.736
It can protect against
elemental attacks.

15:46.058 --> 15:48.902
- What is that?
- It's a Book of Shadows.

15:49.254 --> 15:51.050
It's where she keeps
her spells.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.477
Here it is.

15:54.541 --> 15:57.030
This is the spell
to activate the talisman.

15:57.077 --> 15:59.178
- You do the next part.
- Why me?

15:59.203 --> 16:01.141
I need to make sure
you're for real.

16:03.977 --> 16:05.659
Seal the circle.

16:08.465 --> 16:10.465
Divinity of the Elements...

16:11.207 --> 16:12.763
I summon Thee.

16:14.505 --> 16:15.889
Earth...

16:17.085 --> 16:18.417
Water...

16:19.624 --> 16:21.020
Air...

16:23.005 --> 16:24.357
Fire.

16:29.514 --> 16:32.404
Within this stone,
I invoke Ye place

16:32.429 --> 16:35.301
your greatest strength,
your kindest grace.

16:35.449 --> 16:37.882
<i>And while this stone
remains at hand...</i>

16:38.384 --> 16:40.857
<i>Thou shalt be safe
throughout this land.</i>

16:49.633 --> 16:52.179
Behold,
the Elemental Talisman.

17:12.380 --> 17:14.936
- Well, that was disappointing.
- And painful!

17:14.962 --> 17:17.480
You failed the test.
I want my talisman back.

17:17.505 --> 17:19.728
But I was just doing
what you told me to do.

17:19.752 --> 17:21.640
Maybe they're alien bees.

17:22.273 --> 17:24.198
That's why they're immune
to your magic.

17:24.753 --> 17:26.420
- Maybe you're right.
- I am...?

17:26.444 --> 17:28.639
If what's attacking us
comes from another world,

17:28.664 --> 17:30.982
then we need to use Elements
<i>from another world!</i>

17:30.983 --> 17:33.212
And where do we get
Elements from another world?

17:34.198 --> 17:35.458
I have an idea.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.728
<i>Why are you giving me this?</i>

18:10.753 --> 18:12.869
I've never been admired before.

18:12.894 --> 18:15.705
Except by my parents, but...
That's compulsory.

18:15.730 --> 18:19.147
Uh, I need some advice.
What's the full state of obligation?

18:19.172 --> 18:21.593
You know, the more you talk,
the less I understand...?

18:25.438 --> 18:28.108
You still here...
Sarah's been under the weather, mate.

18:28.109 --> 18:31.533
- It's okay. I can wait.
- She's gone home for the day, mate.

18:31.917 --> 18:33.675
Come on, let's go get Sam.

18:34.753 --> 18:36.412
I'll be back tomorrow.

18:41.566 --> 18:45.168
If you make that, you can
keep the board you stole off me.

18:46.060 --> 18:47.707
It's <i>my</i> board, anyway.

18:59.893 --> 19:01.617
Suck it, haters!

19:01.642 --> 19:05.084
I am Bremin's Tony Hawk.
The greatest of all time.

19:05.834 --> 19:08.320
"First and last warning",
remember?

19:08.626 --> 19:10.454
I'll be taking that board.

19:10.479 --> 19:14.188
You know what would make me happy?
If I never saw your face again.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.337
Enjoy the rest of your holiday.

19:25.556 --> 19:29.583
- That cop... He's my Dad!
- I had no idea.

19:29.608 --> 19:32.175
But he shouldn't be.
A cop.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.200
- Not in the real world.
- What is he, then?

19:34.357 --> 19:37.344
- He's the world's biggest loser.
- As in "fat"?

19:37.369 --> 19:38.796
As in "loser".

19:39.074 --> 19:41.479
You know the strangest thing
about this experience?

19:41.480 --> 19:44.139
- How much you're loving it...?
- We don't exist here.

19:44.164 --> 19:46.735
And our non-existence
has changed this world.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.638
Take your family, Sam.
You were never born.

19:49.639 --> 19:52.048
But a few months later,
your parents had another son.

19:52.049 --> 19:53.477
And they gave him
the same name.

19:53.478 --> 19:54.890
- Sammy.
- Okay...?

19:55.289 --> 19:58.458
- It's the sound of my mind blowing.
- And the two of you are so alike.

19:58.459 --> 20:00.425
Hey, I'm nothing
like that twisted gimp.

20:00.426 --> 20:02.112
- Well, he is better looking.
- What?!

20:02.113 --> 20:04.862
And you, Jake, in the old world,
your mother was single.

20:04.863 --> 20:06.429
And your father
was a loser.

20:06.430 --> 20:08.280
- Your words.
- And your point is...?

20:08.281 --> 20:11.576
But in this world... Your mother
is married. With a great job.

20:11.577 --> 20:13.375
And your father
is an officer of the law.

20:13.376 --> 20:16.445
Right, so by being born, I ruined
both my parents' lives, yeah?

20:16.470 --> 20:19.685
- I didn't mean it to sound like it did.
- You mean, like the truth?

20:21.538 --> 20:24.619
Good one, Andy.
"Open mouth, change feet."

20:40.087 --> 20:43.694
- This is where you live...?
- Well, you live in a magic shop.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.513
Shall I come in?

20:45.514 --> 20:48.535
I think it's gonna be hard
enough to explain Oscar.

20:50.974 --> 20:52.974
Don't bother talking
about magic with them.

20:52.999 --> 20:56.749
- Why, aren't they aliens too?
- Yeah, from the Planet Cretin.

20:57.062 --> 20:58.999
So... what's our plan?

20:59.945 --> 21:01.726
Find our Elements.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.050
Let's start by running...?

21:11.634 --> 21:14.234
- What's he doing here?
- That doesn't matter right now.

21:14.235 --> 21:16.041
So what does he know?
Do we have to kill him?

21:16.066 --> 21:17.282
I know that you're aliens,

21:17.283 --> 21:20.030
and there's a swarm of killer alien
bees right outside that door.

21:20.055 --> 21:21.280
Yeah, right...

21:22.274 --> 21:24.500
- Aah! Aah!
- Guys!

21:25.423 --> 21:27.893
Wait! This is terrible
for the environment.

21:28.222 --> 21:30.010
Oh, it's okay,
these're organic.

21:30.683 --> 21:32.535
They're coming
through the gaps!

21:32.810 --> 21:34.361
So, what do we do next?

21:34.362 --> 21:37.595
Throughout history, human beings
have been associated with the Elements.

21:38.316 --> 21:41.414
Jake, there's a hole over here.
We need something to fill it, a shoe!

21:41.415 --> 21:44.124
- Use your own!
- Too small! Throw me one of yours.

21:48.988 --> 21:52.455
Jake - practical, stubborn,
brutish - Earth.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.600
So, the other boys
are the other Elements!

21:54.601 --> 21:58.932
I hope. Andy - fluid thinker,
kind of wet - Water.

21:58.957 --> 22:00.253
Perimeter breach!

22:08.539 --> 22:09.966
Here, here...

22:14.615 --> 22:16.536
- Soak it.
- Gross...

22:16.561 --> 22:21.442
Okay. That leaves selfish, superficial,
head in the clouds - Sam. Air.

22:21.622 --> 22:23.200
We just have to catch
his breath.

22:24.225 --> 22:28.429
This is it! The championship quarter!
Prepare for war!

22:30.472 --> 22:31.776
Get a grip!

22:31.801 --> 22:34.399
I hope that's not the last thing
I ever smell!

22:47.404 --> 22:49.606
Divinity of the Elements...

22:49.888 --> 22:53.421
Earth, Water, Air, Fire.

22:53.844 --> 22:55.712
I invoke Thee.

23:19.674 --> 23:21.569
Where's...
Where's Felix?

23:28.387 --> 23:31.087
Coming out to collect your
Most Useless Chicken Award?

23:31.112 --> 23:35.291
- <i>D minus</i> for participation, freak.
- You seemed to have it under control...

23:35.385 --> 23:37.211
You just... left.

23:38.033 --> 23:41.109
What are you talking about?
Felix's magic spell saved us.

23:41.134 --> 23:43.565
Oscar, he hid
under the desk.

23:47.292 --> 23:50.261
See what I mean...?
Cretins.

23:53.961 --> 23:57.638
Presenting...
The Elemental Talisman.

24:02.493 --> 24:07.050
- It doesn't feel any different.
- Trust me. This is <i>real</i> magic.

24:08.207 --> 24:10.636
You know...
You should come over more often.

24:10.887 --> 24:14.933
- Really?
- Yeah. I think we make a good team.

24:16.145 --> 24:17.710
So do I.

24:33.292 --> 24:36.503
- Who's up for a home cooked meal?
- Small problem, we don't have food.

24:36.504 --> 24:38.902
- Your money should get us some basics.
- What money?

24:38.903 --> 24:40.234
Selfish fool...

24:40.235 --> 24:42.961
And to think that in the old world,
you two were good friends.

24:42.962 --> 24:46.166
Yeah, well, in the old world
I had access to a fridge full of food.

24:46.292 --> 24:49.050
- Hmm, mysterious.
- Yes, I am.

24:49.075 --> 24:50.912
Hey! Police!

24:51.303 --> 24:52.729
- What's your name?
- Jake.

24:52.730 --> 24:54.252
- Jake who?
- Just Jake.

24:54.300 --> 24:57.480
You tell me who your parents are and
we'll drop these shoplifting charges.

24:57.498 --> 24:59.944
Jake's been arrested and it won't
take them long to find the rest of us.

24:59.969 --> 25:02.469
- It's got footage of us trashing the gym.
- Gotcha.

25:02.470 --> 25:05.147
You need an adult to help you
get into the police station.

25:05.422 --> 25:07.330
We still have to get
past the crows.

25:07.355 --> 25:09.067
Janet Hawker.
Child Protection Services.

25:09.068 --> 25:11.068
- Tell me the truth.
- You want the truth...?

25:11.140 --> 25:12.580
Run...!

25:12.581 --> 25:14.581
What will happen
if we can't get to Jake in time?

25:14.582 --> 25:17.361
- He'll be fostered out, probably.
- We can't let that happen.
