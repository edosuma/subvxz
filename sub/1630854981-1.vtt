12:41.700 --> 12:45.000
GET THEE BEHIND ME, SATAN!

15:18.000 --> 15:21.330
Would you like a beer?

15:32.230 --> 15:35.360
Are you looking for someone?

15:43.030 --> 15:44.060
One more, please.

18:35.100 --> 18:37.000
Hey!

18:58.400 --> 19:02.060
You don't like to be followed.
Cecilia doesn't either.

19:09.330 --> 19:11.630
Who the hell are you?

20:31.560 --> 20:35.300
She is Anna and Kristian's daughter.

23:17.060 --> 23:22.230
Kristian Morild Indicted

25:11.600 --> 25:13.350
Easy now, Kristian.

25:13.550 --> 25:16.160
Don't scare your visitor.

26:28.630 --> 26:31.130
Easy now, Kristian.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.730
Easy now!

27:18.330 --> 27:21.100
Unbelievable...

27:27.460 --> 27:30.460
Are you feeling okay, Kristian?

27:46.630 --> 27:49.040
- Calm down!
- I am calm!

27:49.250 --> 27:52.200
I am calm.
She just has to tell me who she is.

27:53.660 --> 27:56.060
Why do you ask about that?

27:57.630 --> 28:00.400
Who is she? Who are you?

31:28.760 --> 31:30.700
Can I help you?

32:52.000 --> 32:53.610
Hi.

32:53.810 --> 32:56.700
This is Hunter from USA.

32:58.630 --> 33:01.980
She is Anna's daughter.

33:02.180 --> 33:05.260
That's a surprise.

42:39.630 --> 42:41.660
Amen.

45:34.030 --> 45:36.160
Mom!

52:41.000 --> 52:42.410
Hi.

52:42.610 --> 52:46.030
Great, I'll be right there.

59:21.760 --> 59:25.760
If Torstein has made up his mind,
he's made up his mind.

1:08:12.430 --> 1:08:14.460
Hello?

1:08:18.630 --> 1:08:20.700
Torstein?

1:08:23.530 --> 1:08:25.560
Oh, my God!

1:09:02.700 --> 1:09:05.760
<i>You've called Cecilia.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

1:10:12.230 --> 1:10:15.660
<i>What if I have to live here forever?</i>
<i>I'll run away or I'll jump!</i>

1:11:27.100 --> 1:11:29.760
Hi, it's me. Are you at work?

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:35.310
Great. I must ask you a favor. Could
you check if a guy called Stian Norheim

1:11:35.510 --> 1:11:40.230
was admitted last night?

1:11:45.100 --> 1:11:46.530
Okay.

1:11:48.630 --> 1:11:50.980
That's good.

1:11:51.180 --> 1:11:55.080
Very good.
No, I don't know him personally but...

1:11:55.280 --> 1:11:58.510
He's an asshole who got what he deserved.

1:11:58.710 --> 1:12:01.280
Yes, okay. Thanks a lot.

1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:04.260
Sure. See you.

1:12:36.300 --> 1:12:38.460
<i>Anna is sitting outside...</i>

1:12:40.560 --> 1:12:44.000
<i>Me and Anna were at the mall</i>
<i>where we met one of the boys...</i>

1:22:29.460 --> 1:22:31.600
Go away!

1:22:34.400 --> 1:22:36.300
Go away!

1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:08.060
I got it from...

1:23:51.460 --> 1:23:53.600
Where is she?

1:25:44.530 --> 1:25:46.530
No, no!

1:25:51.460 --> 1:25:55.280
Please, Torstein. It's not too late.

1:25:55.480 --> 1:25:58.010
Satan has claimed Liv's soul.

1:25:58.210 --> 1:26:02.360
She can no longer be cleansed,
but there is hope for Anna.

1:30:41.300 --> 1:30:43.500
Damn you!

1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:27.430
Liv.

1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:34.530
Anna.

1:33:20.330 --> 1:33:24.310
I'm so sorry. I did not know.

1:33:24.510 --> 1:33:26.610
Don't be.

1:33:26.810 --> 1:33:31.200
Don't be sorry.
You didn't know, Kristian.

1:35:15.130 --> 1:35:17.130
No.

1:36:57.560 --> 1:37:01.260
- Where is she?
- She ran.
