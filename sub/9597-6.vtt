00:10.678 --> 00:13.692
Welcome. I'm a Rhodium.

00:13.726 --> 00:15.635
I'm just Iridium.

00:15.670 --> 00:20.140
That's fine. I'm not a snob.
Sit down.

00:26.750 --> 00:31.124
- You know what to do?
- I've been instructed, yes.

00:31.158 --> 00:34.862
I'm very used to this. Don't be afraid.

00:34.897 --> 00:36.897
I'm not.

00:46.078 --> 00:48.741
Oh, my god! Are you okay?

01:00.125 --> 01:04.048
A joy of controlling
how the hot water rises

01:04.174 --> 01:08.562
before a torrent of pressure
penetrates the tamped beans.

01:08.596 --> 01:11.833
Okay, I'm done watching
coffee porn.

01:14.602 --> 01:17.171
How did instant get in my cupboard?

01:17.788 --> 01:19.440
You are so impatient!

01:19.474 --> 01:23.145
Maura, I just want a cup of coffee,
not a roman orgy. 

01:23.179 --> 01:25.547
- Morning. Morning.
- Oh!

01:26.816 --> 01:28.517
Where are you going ...
a garden party?

01:28.551 --> 01:30.651
- Going to work.
- Like that?

01:30.685 --> 01:33.446
I think she looks beautiful.
And I love your shoes.

01:33.480 --> 01:36.505
I haven't worn
high heels in a while.

01:36.539 --> 01:38.640
30 years is more than "a while."

01:38.675 --> 01:41.109
You know, there's a trick
to wearing high heels.

01:41.144 --> 01:43.111
Yeah, I know ...
don't wear them.

01:43.146 --> 01:44.580
Just slip these into your shoes.

01:44.614 --> 01:48.217
- I can wear heels all day long with them.
- Yeah, she runs in hers.

01:50.754 --> 01:53.422
Nice. Oh.

01:53.457 --> 01:55.124
- Other one.
- See? It's easy.

01:55.159 --> 01:57.660
How's that?

01:57.695 --> 01:59.829
Nice.

01:59.863 --> 02:02.731
And gushy.
Thanks.

02:04.300 --> 02:06.299
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.699
I think my mom has
a gentleman caller.

02:08.735 --> 02:12.838
- Your mother is a beautiful woman.
- My mother flosses in bed.

02:17.410 --> 02:20.379
Oh. It's Hope.

02:20.413 --> 02:23.415
- Answer it.
- What do I say?

02:23.449 --> 02:26.418
"Hello, biological Mom Hope.

02:26.452 --> 02:29.086
- My name is Maura. I didn't die at birth."
- Shut up.

02:29.121 --> 02:30.722
No, you shouldn't say, "shut up."

02:30.756 --> 02:32.456
Dr. Isles.

02:32.491 --> 02:35.360
Oh, hello, Dr. Martin.
What a surprise.

02:38.665 --> 02:41.367
Oh, yes, I-I would love
to have dinner with you.

02:41.401 --> 02:44.370
Tonight would be great.

02:44.404 --> 02:46.572
Uh, would you like to
come over to my house?

02:46.607 --> 02:48.641
Sure, you ...
you can bring your daughter.

02:48.676 --> 02:51.177
Okay, I ...
I will text you my address.

02:51.211 --> 02:54.780
I-I look forward to it.
Okay, bye-bye.

02:54.815 --> 02:57.517
Oh, my gosh.

02:57.551 --> 02:59.252
Why did I invite them here?
The place is a wreck.

02:59.286 --> 03:01.521
Oh, I'd be so embarrassed

03:01.555 --> 03:04.324
- to invite anyone but me here.
- And what will I serve?

03:04.358 --> 03:08.361
I mean, she probably has a more refined
palate than me.

03:08.395 --> 03:11.364
Oh, saved by murder. Come on.

03:11.398 --> 03:13.766
No, no, I-I can't go.
I have way too much to do.

03:13.801 --> 03:16.503
Okay, I think I can
do an autopsy by now.

03:16.537 --> 03:18.271
Well, I to take have a shower.

03:18.305 --> 03:19.806
Maura.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.741
Hot water gets shut off
in three minutes.

03:21.808 --> 03:26.312
Bathroom's that way.
Running.

<b>3x06 - Money Maker</b>

03:51.671 --> 03:54.006
Wow. 3 million bucks?
Wow.

03:54.074 --> 03:57.910
I didn't even ask her if she's a vegan.
What if she's allergic to shellfish?

03:57.944 --> 04:00.646
- You just said she's a vegan.
- No, I did not.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.915
You know, I can't pull
together a formal dinner

04:02.949 --> 04:04.650
in ... what ... 10 hours.

04:04.684 --> 04:07.319
Yeah, considering it takes you
4 hours to make a cup of coffee.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.656
No. No, no, no, not
with the heavy breathing.

04:10.690 --> 04:13.992
- No, stop, and I'll help you.
- I'm trying.

04:14.026 --> 04:16.127
Okay, you call my mother.
All right? You flatter her.

04:16.161 --> 04:17.362
You tell her what a great cook she is.

04:17.396 --> 04:19.596
She eats that up.
She'll cook for you.

04:19.632 --> 04:21.933
- Oh, it's such an imposition.
- Not if you invite her to dinner.

04:24.203 --> 04:25.971
Somebody's Mercedes
got a parking ticket.

04:26.005 --> 04:28.673
You run the plates?
What do we got?

04:28.708 --> 04:29.941
A couple looking at
the house called police.

04:29.975 --> 04:32.744
The real-estate agent is a handful.

04:32.778 --> 04:34.179
Yay.

04:34.213 --> 04:36.220
Is this your listing?
It's a beautiful property.

04:36.316 --> 04:38.816
Georgette Wilkins. I have
many other properties.

04:38.851 --> 04:41.286
It's all the exclusive
neighborhoods. Give me a call.

04:46.207 --> 04:48.726
What makes you think I can't
afford a $3 million dollar home?

04:49.794 --> 04:55.899
Well, cops' salaries...
never mind.

04:55.933 --> 05:00.062
This house went into foreclosure
a year ago, while it was being renovated.

05:00.130 --> 05:04.053
I almost had a sale.
Is all this really necessary?

05:04.121 --> 05:05.813
Pretty necessary when there's a murder.

05:05.848 --> 05:07.315
It wasn't a murder.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.983
I'd say it's at least
a piece of a murder.

05:11.685 --> 05:12.918
Division Detectives didn't
know what to make of it.

05:12.953 --> 05:16.821
It's the entire
right fossa triangularis and the scapha.

05:16.855 --> 05:18.756
You hear that, Korsak?

05:18.790 --> 05:20.857
It's a whole fossil
triangle and a scaffold.

05:20.891 --> 05:22.091
It's the right ear.

05:22.125 --> 05:25.994
- Why is it 3 feet off the ground?
- It's listening through the keyhole?

05:26.028 --> 05:27.862
Well, the minimum of blood

05:27.897 --> 05:31.232
suggests that this ear
was detached postmortem.

05:33.170 --> 05:34.873
Got a drop of blood out here.

05:34.907 --> 05:38.210
It's not much, but I got
another drop over here.

05:38.244 --> 05:40.044
- Hey, Jane.
- Yeah?

05:40.079 --> 05:41.745
Mercedes is registered to Neal Murray.

05:43.047 --> 05:47.149
And what's his car doing here
if he lives in Beacon Hill?

05:47.183 --> 05:50.251
Do you know this man ...
Neal Murray?

05:50.319 --> 05:52.886
No. Never seen him before.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.322
Look, I have another listing.
You have my card.

05:58.424 --> 06:01.259
- Run her.
- Got it.

06:02.827 --> 06:05.229
You think there's a body
in the trunk of that car?

06:12.202 --> 06:14.403
Georgette's clean.

06:14.437 --> 06:16.338
Wait! Stop!

06:16.372 --> 06:19.274
Stop! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop! Put it down.

06:19.342 --> 06:21.843
<i>Okay. There you go.</i>

06:25.381 --> 06:28.149
He appears to be
wearing a cloak and a mask.

06:28.184 --> 06:29.350
I think we found the body
that goes to that ear.

06:29.385 --> 06:33.220
I'm not prepared to say conclusively
until I've tested tissue samples.

06:33.255 --> 06:38.023
- Maura, he's got one ear.
- Looks like Neal Murray.

06:39.392 --> 06:41.292
Something bad went down in that house.

06:52.074 --> 06:55.777
Turns out our victim co-owns
an investment company.

06:55.811 --> 06:58.279
What's a millionaire hedge-fund manager

06:58.314 --> 07:02.049
doing in a garbage can
in a mask and a cloak?

07:02.084 --> 07:03.451
Hiding?

07:03.485 --> 07:06.588
Thank you, Sherlock Holmes.

07:06.622 --> 07:09.160
What's this on his cloak?
It looks like jelly.

07:10.262 --> 07:12.585
I'll have the crime lab test it.

07:12.709 --> 07:15.603
Ooh, you got a treasure trove over here.
Where'd you find the blond hair?

07:15.637 --> 07:20.074
- It was caught in this pin.
- Which is stamped "Rhodium."

07:20.108 --> 07:22.343
Rhodium is a rare metal ...
the most valuable, in fact.

07:22.377 --> 07:23.744
Hmm, the plot thickens.

07:23.778 --> 07:29.083
My preliminary examination indicates
that he experienced a cardiac event.

07:29.117 --> 07:30.551
It was quite an event.

07:30.585 --> 07:32.452
Yeah, well, you haven't
heard the best part.

07:32.487 --> 07:34.721
Let's talk about his penis.

07:34.756 --> 07:36.456
If we must.

07:37.325 --> 07:38.726
Not seeing much to talk about.

07:38.760 --> 07:44.164
- You see the needle marks?
- No! I didn't look that close.

07:44.199 --> 07:45.866
Consistent with treatment
for erectile dysfunction.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.302
It's too bad he didn't
hear about viagra.

07:48.336 --> 07:50.404
His heart condition prohibited it.

07:50.438 --> 07:53.641
18 million american men suffer
from erectile dysfunction.

07:53.675 --> 07:55.643
Injection therapy is very popular.

07:55.677 --> 07:58.647
Oh, sure, yeah. Who doesn't
want to shoot up their privates?

07:58.681 --> 08:01.120
The victim was left-handed.

08:01.155 --> 08:04.457
I found seven injection sites
high on the left side of the shaft.

08:04.492 --> 08:07.794
But the last injection site
was low on the right side.

08:07.828 --> 08:10.397
So, a right-handed person injected him.

08:10.431 --> 08:12.332
And the needle gauge
was much bigger, too.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.268
Find out what was in that final
syringe. 

08:14.302 --> 08:16.470
Until we know, we can't
call this a murder.

08:16.504 --> 08:20.341
Okay, I'm gonna go interview
his business partner.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.510
Call me if you find something new.

08:29.402 --> 08:32.471
Excuse me.
Hi, I'm Detective Jane Rizzoli.

08:32.506 --> 08:34.140
This is Detective Barry Frost.

08:34.174 --> 08:36.142
We'd like to talk to
you about Neal Murray.

08:36.177 --> 08:38.578
What happened? We don't
know. We're investigating.

08:38.613 --> 08:41.048
I'm his partner, Dale Bowman.
This is Doug and Lori Gatz.

08:41.082 --> 08:43.450
Doug and I went to high
school right here with Neal.

08:43.485 --> 08:45.052
Well, then, Neal was
supposed to be here today?

08:45.086 --> 08:46.485
Yes, he was gonna give us a check

08:46.520 --> 08:48.385
for a new athletic
complex and football field.

08:48.420 --> 08:50.320
Hey, Doug, you'll get that check.

08:50.354 --> 08:53.122
I can't believe he's gone.

08:53.157 --> 08:55.291
- Could you give us a minute?
- Sure.

08:56.325 --> 08:59.161
Uh, where were you last night?

08:59.195 --> 09:02.097
- Home. Why?
- Any idea why your partner

09:02.131 --> 09:03.331
would have been dressed
in a cloak and a mask?

09:03.366 --> 09:04.599
No. What are you talking about?

09:04.633 --> 09:06.467
Were you having any problems with Neal?

09:06.501 --> 09:08.235
I loved the guy.

09:08.269 --> 09:10.137
Plus, don't know if our company
will survive without him.

09:10.171 --> 09:12.538
- Why not?
- He was a real people person.

09:12.573 --> 09:14.941
He brought in all our big investors.

09:14.975 --> 09:18.078
- We'd like a list of your clients.
- Oh, I'm happy to cooperate.

09:18.112 --> 09:21.715
We have very high-end clients,
all the way down to Doug and Lori.

09:21.750 --> 09:23.550
He's a coach.
She's the school nurse.

09:23.584 --> 09:26.220
But they both have
pensions, thanks to us.

09:26.254 --> 09:27.688
Maybe there was a
disgruntled investor ...

09:27.722 --> 09:29.256
someone who lost money with the firm?

09:29.291 --> 09:32.092
We don't lose money.

09:32.127 --> 09:34.261
Somebody wasn't too happy with Neal.

09:34.296 --> 09:36.230
It wasn't one of our investors.
That much I know.

09:36.264 --> 09:37.364
I'll get that list for you.

09:37.398 --> 09:38.999
Thank you.

09:39.034 --> 09:41.669
We'll be in touch.

09:46.858 --> 09:49.827
Take the gnocchi out of the
hot water, or it'll get sticky.

09:49.862 --> 09:52.097
Jane, stir the wild-boar ragout.

09:52.131 --> 09:54.799
Jane, can you open the Montepulciano?

09:54.834 --> 09:57.068
Stirring boar.
Opening "montipoopanano."

09:58.972 --> 10:01.473
Oh, my god. They're a minute early.

10:02.842 --> 10:07.443
Oh, my god.
What if she saw this?

10:09.112 --> 10:11.179
Just a minute!
Hide it in the bathroom.

10:11.214 --> 10:14.416
Okay. Okay, okay.

10:18.154 --> 10:20.422
Maura.

10:27.164 --> 10:30.366
- Hi.
- Come in, please.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.269
Dr. Isles.
This is my daughter, Cailin.

10:33.304 --> 10:36.805
- Hi, Cailin.
- Hey.

10:38.841 --> 10:42.309
And I think that we really are
settling into a ... a new city.

10:43.361 --> 10:48.449
- Right, Cailin?
- Yeah. We are.

10:48.484 --> 10:51.353
- How do you like Boston?
- I ... I miss London.

10:52.388 --> 10:54.990
Honey, would you stop texting?

10:55.024 --> 10:57.525
Sorry.
I'm just saying goodbye.

10:58.361 --> 11:00.028
Are you in school?

11:00.063 --> 11:03.332
- I was.
- Cailin was at Oxford.

11:03.366 --> 11:07.369
- Oh.
- And you're not anymore?

11:07.403 --> 11:09.838
- Well ...
- We had to move here.

11:11.658 --> 11:13.292
Well, she needs to take a semester off.

11:13.326 --> 11:16.093
Excuse me.
May I use your bathroom?

11:16.128 --> 11:18.729
Of course. It's ...
it's right over there.

11:26.768 --> 11:31.705
It's a complicated relationship ...
mothers and daughters.

11:31.740 --> 11:33.641
Yes, it is.

11:33.675 --> 11:36.243
- It's a phase.
- I hope so.

11:36.278 --> 11:40.614
Cailin just misses her friends.
She doesn't know anyone here in Boston.

11:42.350 --> 11:44.651
Tell me, did your mother
teach you how to cook?

11:45.286 --> 11:49.055
- Actually, Angela made dinner.
- Well, it is delicious.

11:49.089 --> 11:50.789
- Thank you.
- Mm.

11:50.824 --> 11:54.325
My mother ... uh, she didn't
spend much time in the kitchen.

11:54.359 --> 11:58.062
Uh, Maura's mother is an artist
and an art-history professor,

11:58.097 --> 11:59.897
so she traveled a lot.

11:59.932 --> 12:02.333
I traveled a lot when
Cailin was young, too.

12:02.367 --> 12:04.035
Her father's my ex-husband....

12:04.069 --> 12:09.106
he ... he had financial issues,
so I always had to work.

12:09.140 --> 12:12.209
- That's hard.
- Look, Cailin's back.

12:12.243 --> 12:14.878
I think I'll use your ladies' room, too.

12:14.912 --> 12:16.379
Ah, good idea.

12:22.285 --> 12:23.985
Cailin hates me.

12:24.020 --> 12:26.721
She's 18.

12:26.755 --> 12:30.924
She hates everybody over 18...
and under 18.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.259
She's my sister, Jane.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.195
Even when they know
they're related to you,

12:34.229 --> 12:35.863
families are still complicated.

12:48.313 --> 12:54.185
- Hey. This is pretty good.
- Oh, no, thank you.

12:54.219 --> 12:57.088
Really? Not even one bite?

13:08.267 --> 13:10.369
What are you listening to?

13:10.403 --> 13:13.072
Oh. Music.

13:13.106 --> 13:15.372
What kind of bands do you like?

13:17.041 --> 13:22.444
It was nice of you to bring
the cake over. But it's okay.

13:22.479 --> 13:24.680
You don't have to try to engage with me.

13:24.714 --> 13:25.747
Are we that awful?

13:28.183 --> 13:30.785
Will you tell my Mom
that I decided to walk home?

13:30.819 --> 13:32.820
Wait, what?

13:32.854 --> 13:35.689
It's not personal.
I just would like to be alone.

13:44.332 --> 13:48.101
- Was that Cailin?
- She said she wanted to be alone.

13:48.135 --> 13:52.839
Did Cailin leave?
Are you leaving?

13:52.873 --> 13:57.010
She's very fragile right now.
Thank you for dinner. I'm so sorry.

14:02.316 --> 14:04.819
What the hell just happened?

14:12.062 --> 14:16.466
I don't think Cailin should have
been forced to have dinner with us. 

14:16.534 --> 14:18.535
Why weren't you this
evolved when I was 18?

14:21.572 --> 14:23.807
Smells so good.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.910
I'm so sorry about last night.

14:26.944 --> 14:30.080
Why? It wasn't your fault.

14:30.314 --> 14:31.648
What is that?

14:31.682 --> 14:33.550
A chilled lavender towel.
Put it on your neck.

14:33.584 --> 14:35.352
- No.
- It's very soothing.

14:35.386 --> 14:38.489
It's used for treating amenorrhea,
athlete's foot, vaginitis.

14:38.523 --> 14:40.657
I'm eating.
I don't need to be soothed.

14:40.692 --> 14:42.759
Our victim's tox report came back.

14:42.794 --> 14:45.629
No sign of his
erectile-dysfunction medication.

14:45.663 --> 14:46.730
Still eating.

14:47.832 --> 14:49.466
He was injected with something.
What was it?

14:49.500 --> 14:52.669
I'm still testing.
I dissected his heart tissue.

14:52.704 --> 14:55.139
And whatever drug was injected
did cause a heart attack.

14:56.174 --> 14:58.174
There you are.

14:58.209 --> 15:00.710
Hello, Dr. Martin. Hi.

15:00.744 --> 15:03.479
<i>Have a fabulous day. Call me later.</i>

15:04.548 --> 15:05.815
Hi.

15:07.517 --> 15:12.489
- I feel the need to apologize for Cailin.
- No, please don't.

15:12.523 --> 15:15.525
You know, I was 18 once,
and her life has been disrupted.

15:15.559 --> 15:18.594
It's all right. I ...
I just feel bad for you.

15:18.629 --> 15:25.467
Cailin is actually very ill, which
is why I brought her back to Boston.

15:28.904 --> 15:30.639
Have a seat.

15:32.508 --> 15:35.143
With what?
Can you say?

15:35.177 --> 15:39.514
She contracted a bacterial infection
while I was doing relief work in Africa.

15:39.549 --> 15:40.849
You can't blame yourself.

15:40.883 --> 15:44.219
She's in desperate need
of a kidney transplant.

15:44.254 --> 15:46.588
And of course, I would give her
one of my own in a heartbeat,

15:46.656 --> 15:49.858
but... we're not a match.

15:51.627 --> 15:54.329
And neither is her father.

15:54.364 --> 15:55.897
It is so ironic.

15:55.932 --> 15:59.935
I've helped so many patients,
and I cannot help my own child.

15:59.969 --> 16:01.937
There must be something that I can do.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.242
No, there isn't, but I
so appreciate the thought.

16:16.785 --> 16:18.252
Got something.

16:18.287 --> 16:22.290
Our victim was treated for chest pains
last week at the E.R. in Dedham.

16:22.358 --> 16:24.893
Neal's next of kin is "heavy drizzle"?

16:24.927 --> 16:27.330
- Who's that?
- Whoever took him to the hospital, I guess.

16:27.364 --> 16:30.334
"Heavy drizzle"? The Drizz?
The famous crunk rapper?

16:30.368 --> 16:34.205
Okay, check the list of
investors from Murray & Bowman.

16:34.239 --> 16:35.740
See if "the Drizz" is on it.

16:35.774 --> 16:38.342
I think his real name is Lamar Jones.

16:38.376 --> 16:40.344
He once renegotiated
a recording contract

16:40.378 --> 16:41.945
by hanging an executive from
his ankles off a balcony.

16:48.754 --> 16:51.756
The Drizz!
"Crunk in the trunk" ... I love that song.

17:03.669 --> 17:04.636
Okay, stop, stop.

17:04.670 --> 17:06.405
What? Okay, Frankie.

17:06.439 --> 17:08.307
- Stop, stop. Just...
- What?

17:08.340 --> 17:10.276
- That's not how it goes, man.
- Aw.

17:10.310 --> 17:12.344
If you're gonna do it, let
me show you how it's done.

17:12.378 --> 17:13.746
All right.

17:13.780 --> 17:16.648
All right, okay, so, it's, like,
side to side. Start side to side.

17:16.683 --> 17:18.317
- Like this?
- Yeah.

17:18.352 --> 17:19.618
- And then you just start to walk.
- I'm walking.

17:19.653 --> 17:23.321
Okay, and then get ready.
Get ready. And then "aah!"

17:23.356 --> 17:25.424
And then you bring this.
Yeah, there you go. Yes!

17:25.458 --> 17:27.358
- You start smacking that.
- Smack it.

17:30.863 --> 17:32.462
I'll show you thunk!

17:32.497 --> 17:34.698
How's that? Would you
like some more thunk?

17:34.765 --> 17:36.532
Keep doing that with your behinds.

17:38.768 --> 17:42.470
I expect this
behavior from you, Francesco.

17:42.505 --> 17:45.340
But not you, Barold.

17:45.374 --> 17:47.776
- Why does she expect it from me?
- She likes Barold.

17:47.810 --> 17:49.645
No idea why.

17:49.679 --> 17:53.516
Let's get Mr. Drizzle
in here for questioning.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.451
- Where you going, Jane?
- I got to go check on Maura.

18:02.393 --> 18:05.395
Is that last night's dessert,
and am I about to get sick?

18:05.429 --> 18:09.366
- I think we're a match.
- You're not really my type.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.834
Me and Cailin.

18:10.868 --> 18:14.337
I think we're having
different conversations.

18:14.372 --> 18:15.772
Cailin needs a kidney.

18:15.806 --> 18:18.908
So, you going to make
it out of that cake?

18:18.943 --> 18:22.512
Of course not. I needed
a sample of her DNA.

18:22.546 --> 18:24.680
Y-you can't give her a kidney.

18:24.715 --> 18:27.316
It's my kidney.
I can give it to whomever I please.

18:27.350 --> 18:28.751
Oh, so, you told Hope?

18:31.922 --> 18:33.789
I'm going to donate anonymously.

18:33.823 --> 18:38.027
You need any help getting it out, or
are you gonna do that by yourself, too?

18:38.061 --> 18:39.695
What ... no, Maura.
What are you thinking? No!

18:39.729 --> 18:42.698
Cailin's dying, Jane.
And Hope is overwhelmed.

18:42.733 --> 18:44.433
The last thing she needs is to relive

18:44.468 --> 18:48.571
the worst event of her life ...
my birth ... and death.

18:48.605 --> 18:51.541
I guess I just don't get it.

18:53.710 --> 18:57.914
If I ...
if I tell her who I am ...

18:57.948 --> 19:01.518
I'll be a reminder of her tragic past.

19:02.653 --> 19:04.521
I'll never be anything else to her.

19:06.658 --> 19:10.995
- What? You only need one kidney.
- You're incredible.

19:11.029 --> 19:13.731
You'd do the same for
one of your brothers.

19:13.765 --> 19:17.468
Maybe.
They'd have to be really, really nice.

19:18.070 --> 19:19.871
I'd definitely do it for you, though.

19:24.474 --> 19:26.511
<i>Your wretched lyrics </i>

19:26.512 --> 19:28.413
with tail shaking and behind flapping,

19:28.448 --> 19:32.418
<i>violent metaphors and images.
And you know something, mister?</i>

19:32.452 --> 19:33.986
Children are dying because of you.

19:34.020 --> 19:37.323
- Shaking booty never killed nobody.
- "Anybody."

19:42.195 --> 19:43.462
<i>Who the hell is that?</i>

19:43.496 --> 19:45.764
That's a family-assistance counselor.

19:45.798 --> 19:48.467
What kind of assistance
that sister offering?

19:48.502 --> 19:53.072
Come on, Drizz.
Uh, posse waits downstairs.

19:53.107 --> 19:56.442
- Frost?
- Hold on.

19:56.476 --> 20:00.345
Uh, can I come?
Please?

20:00.380 --> 20:03.882
All right, stand there
and don't open your mouth.

20:07.955 --> 20:10.189
Nah, I ain't never met that dude.

20:10.224 --> 20:13.159
That dude is your investment
adviser ... Neal Murray.

20:13.194 --> 20:15.430
I got a lot of advisers.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.864
Who advises you in murder?

20:16.899 --> 20:20.001
Damn. Who did that man like that?

20:20.035 --> 20:22.170
Maybe you.
Did he lose your money?

20:22.204 --> 20:23.838
You're not a gangster anymore, Drizz.

20:23.873 --> 20:27.108
You're a businessman
with a multimillion-dollar empire.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.111
This kind of publicity
wouldn't be good for your brand.

20:29.145 --> 20:34.116
Uh...
okay, Neal was my money man.

20:34.151 --> 20:36.419
He brought me into his firm.

20:36.453 --> 20:38.087
A diversified portfolio provides a buffer

20:38.121 --> 20:41.424
against the vicissitudes
of the music industry,

20:41.458 --> 20:43.426
So we were ...

20:43.461 --> 20:45.428
What?
A homeboy can't know finance?

20:45.463 --> 20:48.565
Let's talk about your visit
with Neal to the E.R., yo.

20:48.599 --> 20:50.300
Look, Neal was a good dude.

20:50.334 --> 20:54.871
He knew how to have crazy-ass fun,
but I needed my liquid capital back.

20:54.905 --> 20:59.843
Neal said Dale wouldn't let
me have my own damn money back.

20:59.877 --> 21:01.511
I'm still not hearing
anything about the E.R.

21:01.545 --> 21:06.049
All right, I took Neal for
a spin on I-90 in my donk... yo.

21:06.083 --> 21:09.953
Actually, it's my screen saver.

21:11.456 --> 21:13.557
Nice. 28-inch chrome rims.

21:13.591 --> 21:17.427
Officer... this is an interview.

21:17.461 --> 21:20.096
How fast were you going in your... donk?

21:20.130 --> 21:22.198
Oh, 55.

21:24.234 --> 21:29.939
All right, all right.
Maybe a ... above 55.

21:29.973 --> 21:31.875
Neal said it was giving him chest pains.

21:31.909 --> 21:33.142
That's what you were
hoping for, wasn't it?

21:33.177 --> 21:35.278
You told him you'd
take him to the hospital

21:35.312 --> 21:37.113
if he'd give you your money back?

21:37.147 --> 21:40.216
Eh, yeah...
something like that.

21:40.450 --> 21:42.618
Neal told me not to tell Dale.

21:42.652 --> 21:45.254
Neal gave me the money
out of his own pocket.

21:46.990 --> 21:49.992
I feel like talking to old Dale again.

21:52.462 --> 21:55.565
I'm ... I'm sorry
about playing that rap.

21:55.599 --> 21:59.702
I've taught children for 55 years.

21:59.736 --> 22:02.238
Some of the poorest
neighborhoods in the city.

22:02.272 --> 22:03.639
It must have been challenging.

22:03.673 --> 22:08.243
It was that, but it was also rewarding.
It was my life's work.

22:11.915 --> 22:15.718
That's Dontrell.
He was in the last class I taught.

22:15.752 --> 22:18.555
He was the loveliest,
sweetest little boy.

22:19.189 --> 22:20.390
"Was"?

22:20.424 --> 22:23.660
He died...
in a drive-by shooting.

22:23.728 --> 22:25.962
Excuse me. I'm fighting a cold.

22:25.997 --> 22:28.799
- I understand.
- Oh, yeah?

22:28.833 --> 22:32.670
You understand the virus that's baffled
scientists for hundreds of years?

22:32.704 --> 22:34.772
We're both trying to save the world.

22:34.806 --> 22:37.241
Well, I couldn't save Dontrell.

22:37.275 --> 22:40.677
- Stand back.
- What?

22:40.745 --> 22:42.613
Take care of yourself, sister.

22:49.521 --> 22:53.024
We'd like to talk to
you about Lamar Jones.

22:53.058 --> 22:54.525
Who?

22:54.559 --> 22:56.761
You might know him as Heavy Drizzle.
He's one of your investors.

22:56.795 --> 22:59.597
Oh, yeah. Drizz.
Sure, I know him.

22:59.631 --> 23:01.799
Why'd you make it so hard for him
to get his money out of your firm?

23:01.833 --> 23:04.268
I run a hedge fund, Detectives.

23:04.302 --> 23:07.538
I make a lot of money for
my clients if, and only if,

23:07.573 --> 23:10.008
I lock in their money for a set period.

23:10.042 --> 23:12.276
Did you know Neal gave
Drizz his money back?

23:12.311 --> 23:15.713
I think it's time to tell
you to talk to my lawyer.

23:19.786 --> 23:21.787
Have a nice day.

23:23.557 --> 23:24.824
You see his key chain?

23:24.858 --> 23:26.459
Just like the one we found on Neal.

23:27.461 --> 23:31.030
Murray & Bowman's financial
statements are bogus.

23:31.064 --> 23:32.498
There's no way they're
getting these returns.

23:32.532 --> 23:33.866
This looks like a Ponzi scheme.

23:33.900 --> 23:35.568
Explains why Dale

23:35.602 --> 23:36.736
didn't want investors like
Drizz pulling their money out.

23:38.472 --> 23:42.608
I know why Dale and our victim
carried the same key fob.

23:42.643 --> 23:43.876
It's a flash drive.

23:48.781 --> 23:50.615
Hmm.
It's taking me to a website.

23:50.650 --> 23:54.386
10preciousmetals.com.

23:58.089 --> 24:00.025
I'm in.

24:03.096 --> 24:05.097
Neal was running an
underground sex club.

24:06.066 --> 24:09.034
Drizz said old Neal knew
how to have "crazy-ass fun."

24:09.069 --> 24:12.505
"To upgrade your investment,
contact your investment adviser."

24:12.539 --> 24:14.774
10 different levels of call girls.

24:14.808 --> 24:16.442
For 10 different levels of investors.

24:16.476 --> 24:18.077
The more you invest, the hotter the girl.

24:18.111 --> 24:20.012
Frost, click the link
that says, "calendar."

24:20.047 --> 24:22.782
It's got party
dates and street addresses.

24:22.816 --> 24:24.450
Look, two nights ago,
there was a secret sex party

24:24.484 --> 24:26.552
at the vacant mansion
where we found Neal's ear.

24:26.587 --> 24:29.422
- A "secret sex party"?
- What would you call it?

24:29.456 --> 24:31.557
Entertainment.

24:32.960 --> 24:35.561
Check some of the other parties.
See if they're at vacant homes.

24:37.932 --> 24:40.067
They were. Good call, Jane.

24:40.101 --> 24:42.636
Listing agent on all of
them was Georgette Wilkins.

24:42.670 --> 24:43.903
I thought you ran her name.

24:43.938 --> 24:45.672
I did. Nothing came up.

24:45.706 --> 24:47.740
Maybe her name isn't
Georgette. Let's run her prints.

24:47.775 --> 24:49.409
We don't have her prints.

24:49.443 --> 24:51.044
Yes, we do. Georgette
gave me her business card.

24:52.746 --> 24:56.883
Old-school has always wanted to try
new school's laser print scanner.

25:05.059 --> 25:09.764
"Candy Smith."
Ooh, Georgette is a prostitute.

25:09.798 --> 25:11.865
In fairness, she's a former prostitute.

25:12.868 --> 25:15.703
Georgette sold Neal his house.

25:15.737 --> 25:17.872
Neal and Dale were
desperate for investors.

25:17.906 --> 25:21.743
So Georgette supplies the girls
in the houses she couldn't sell.

25:21.777 --> 25:23.978
Neal throws the parties,
the rich whales swim in.

25:24.012 --> 25:26.947
- Everybody's happy.
- So, why is Neal dead?

25:33.821 --> 25:34.990
Thank you.

25:35.024 --> 25:39.629
- Dr. Martin. Please come in.
- I'm sorry to barge in yet again.

25:39.663 --> 25:42.498
There really was no one
else that I could talk to.

25:42.533 --> 25:46.736
Well, you can talk to me.
Please.

25:48.205 --> 25:51.541
Why is it so much
easier to tell a stranger

25:51.575 --> 25:54.644
the most intimate details of your life?

25:54.678 --> 25:57.180
Because a stranger doesn't judge.

25:57.214 --> 26:00.783
Hmm.

26:00.818 --> 26:03.786
My daughter.

26:03.821 --> 26:07.924
I fell like I barely know her.
She's just so angry.

26:09.594 --> 26:12.563
And she has the right.

26:12.597 --> 26:14.565
I took her to a place
that made her sick,

26:14.599 --> 26:17.167
and I've made her live my life.

26:17.202 --> 26:20.768
I don't have children, but I ...
I think I understand.

26:22.237 --> 26:27.541
Well, no one makes you know you've
failed the way your child does.

26:27.575 --> 26:32.611
I think all daughters feel
that way about their mothers.

26:32.646 --> 26:36.148
We fear that...
we won't measure up.

26:37.817 --> 26:42.086
But it's a mother's job
to protect her child.

26:42.120 --> 26:44.755
I've failed twice.

26:47.925 --> 26:52.027
You said that you...
that your first baby died.

26:52.062 --> 26:56.832
I mean, how ...
how can that be your fault?

26:56.866 --> 26:59.567
And Cailin ... she's ...
she's a teenager.

26:59.602 --> 27:02.536
You know, it's
her job to push you away.

27:04.005 --> 27:07.640
It says that she's strong...
because of you.

27:07.674 --> 27:09.908
Maybe.

27:13.146 --> 27:19.716
Mass General called today.
They found a kidney donor for her.

27:21.618 --> 27:25.120
It's an anonymous donor.

27:25.154 --> 27:26.688
A complete stranger.

27:29.925 --> 27:34.761
Maura, I'm afraid I've
already lost my daughter.

27:34.796 --> 27:38.932
- Not to this illness, but...
- You haven't.

27:40.935 --> 27:42.902
I know you haven't.

27:42.936 --> 27:48.607
You have been so very kind.

27:48.642 --> 27:50.776
The kindest of strangers.

28:02.019 --> 28:04.086
We know you lied about your
relationship with Neal Murray.

28:04.121 --> 28:07.088
I'm so sorry, officer. I have no
idea what you're talking about.

28:07.123 --> 28:08.589
I'm late for a lunch appointment.

28:08.624 --> 28:10.224
Drop the act, Candy.

28:10.258 --> 28:13.093
Yeah, I knew Neal.
That isn't a crime.

28:13.127 --> 28:15.095
Obstruction of
a murder investigation is.

28:15.130 --> 28:18.432
I don't know how he died
or what he was doing in that house.

28:18.466 --> 28:20.924
Maybe he was at a party for big,
fat investor whales,

28:21.034 --> 28:23.204
and maybe you supplied the
high-class call girls for it.

28:23.238 --> 28:26.308
- Maybe you were even there, Candy.
- Or maybe you don't have jack.

28:26.342 --> 28:29.044
Excuse me.
I have a lunch appointment.

28:34.183 --> 28:36.017
How does he know we're not members?

28:37.586 --> 28:42.156
- Who you calling?
- The only member I know.

28:45.427 --> 28:47.094
All right, well, where is she?

28:47.129 --> 28:49.497
She couldn't have eaten
that fast.

28:49.532 --> 28:53.134
Neal's latest tox panel came back
positive for potassium chloride.

28:53.169 --> 28:54.502
Well, is that what stopped his heart?

28:54.537 --> 28:56.171
Well, that's what was
injected into his penis.

28:59.208 --> 29:02.344
Maura. You're gonna get us
kicked out of this place.

29:02.378 --> 29:04.478
Why? Because I said
"potassium chloride"?

29:05.580 --> 29:07.346
What are you having for lunch?

29:07.381 --> 29:10.483
- What are "baby jewels and gems"?
- Lettuce.

29:10.517 --> 29:14.553
We don't call those
"solid, vertical room separators."

29:14.588 --> 29:16.222
- You mean the walls?
- Exactly.

29:16.256 --> 29:20.193
Let-tuce.
Pre-ten-tious.

29:20.228 --> 29:23.864
Ooh.
She's going to the bathroom.

29:23.899 --> 29:25.967
- I'm coming.
- What? No.

29:26.001 --> 29:27.068
I have to pee.

29:27.136 --> 29:30.005
- You better be telling the truth.
- All mammals have to pee.

29:30.039 --> 29:31.907
We got all day.

29:33.209 --> 29:34.843
We know about the parties,

29:34.877 --> 29:37.044
the super-secret precious-metal
code for the girls.

29:37.079 --> 29:39.312
I'm homicide, Georgette, not vice.

29:39.347 --> 29:41.448
Unless you killed Neal,
all I want to do is talk.

29:43.450 --> 29:45.418
He was a nice guy.

29:45.452 --> 29:48.888
Not much in the looks
department, but nice.

29:48.922 --> 29:51.157
I didn't kill him.

29:51.191 --> 29:55.828
Hi. It's safe to talk in front of me.
I'm working the case, too.

29:55.862 --> 29:58.397
- Oh, are you?
- Yes, I am. I'm Dr. Maura ...

29:58.432 --> 30:01.067
Save it. Who cares? Let's get
to the chase? What do you want?

30:01.101 --> 30:02.335
Who was with Neal the night he died?

30:02.369 --> 30:04.270
I don't know. It was busy.

30:04.305 --> 30:06.039
Well, I know you supply the
girls, so give me their names.

30:06.073 --> 30:10.543
Uh, let's see.
Caress, Delight, Peaches.

30:10.578 --> 30:12.312
- I don't suppose you do
any background checks?  - No.

30:12.346 --> 30:14.881
Well, you should at least
check for venereal diseases.

30:14.915 --> 30:16.049
What are you, the health department?

30:16.083 --> 30:18.919
We use the same girls every time.
The clients sign a release.

30:18.953 --> 30:20.353
Informed consent. That's wise.

30:20.388 --> 30:23.056
Look, you're gonna provide
these same girls again,

30:23.090 --> 30:27.260
because one of them injected Neal
with potassium chloride and killed him.

30:27.295 --> 30:28.963
And we're gonna find
her at tonight's party.

30:28.997 --> 30:30.531
And if I don't?

30:30.565 --> 30:32.934
Well, then you can say
buh-bye to all your fancy clubs

30:32.968 --> 30:34.571
and say hello to
Framingham state prison.

30:36.308 --> 30:39.011
Before we do anything, may
I have one of your hairs,

30:39.045 --> 30:40.946
with the root ball attached, please?

30:40.981 --> 30:43.182
What? Ew.

30:47.187 --> 30:51.290
The hair we found on the victim
does not belong to Georgette.

30:51.324 --> 30:54.260
Okay, so we go forward with plan "A".

30:54.294 --> 30:56.629
Another undercover operation, Rizzoli?

30:56.663 --> 30:59.299
Uh, we're just collecting hair samples.
Frost and Korsak will be there.

30:59.333 --> 31:01.401
- I should be there, too.
- No, no, that's okay.

31:01.435 --> 31:03.570
Uh, with, uh,
my comparison microscope.

31:03.604 --> 31:07.474
- No, I don't think so.
- Dr. Isles is right.

31:07.509 --> 31:09.443
She can go look at all the
samples and log them in.

31:09.478 --> 31:13.313
- Preserve chain of custody.
- Okay, sure.

31:13.348 --> 31:16.116
- Yes!
- What is your problem?

31:16.151 --> 31:17.684
Oh. What are we going to wear?

31:17.719 --> 31:20.120
I have never been a high-class
hooker before.

31:22.290 --> 31:24.625
What?

31:37.605 --> 31:39.139
I hate this outfit.

31:39.174 --> 31:40.641
Stop complaining
about the outfits, already.

31:40.675 --> 31:44.276
Why couldn't we dress up like
call girls? They look so cute.

31:45.311 --> 31:47.547
They have to take their
outfits off, Maura.

31:47.581 --> 31:49.382
Oh.

31:49.449 --> 31:52.051
Let's find a place for your science kit.

31:52.085 --> 31:55.455
Oh. Check out
the legs on that one.

31:55.489 --> 31:57.190
That is the hottest part of a woman.

31:57.224 --> 32:03.597
But I also like that little
"S" curve along the hip.

32:03.631 --> 32:05.465
You know, like, when they ...
when they ... when they ...

32:05.500 --> 32:08.068
When they lean back
like that and you just...

32:08.103 --> 32:09.470
You guys know we can hear you, right?

32:17.011 --> 32:18.044
Sorry. My bad.

32:18.079 --> 32:19.445
One down.
17 to go.

32:23.384 --> 32:25.185
That's the coach from Campbell high.

32:25.219 --> 32:26.586
<i> What the heck is he doing there?</i>

32:26.620 --> 32:29.089
Hitting on Georgette, it looks like.

32:29.123 --> 32:31.024
His wife, Lori, is gorgeous.

32:31.059 --> 32:32.659
Bill maher says, "show
me a beautiful woman,

32:32.694 --> 32:34.161
I'll show you a husband who's
sick of sleeping with her."

32:34.195 --> 32:36.328
<i>How did he get the
money to hang out here?</i>

32:43.737 --> 32:49.175
- Wow. How you get in?
- What do you mean?

32:49.210 --> 32:52.045
You're like, not even a ...
a Indium.

32:52.080 --> 32:56.216
"An" Indium.
And, no, I am not.

32:56.250 --> 32:58.619
So, what are you ...
like, Tin or something?

32:58.653 --> 33:00.220
We're, like, aluminum foil.

33:00.255 --> 33:02.556
Don't get all upset about it.
It's not my fault.

33:04.726 --> 33:06.428
Ow!

33:06.462 --> 33:09.599
Everyone here is a perv.

33:15.439 --> 33:17.807
This cuticle thickness is close.

33:17.841 --> 33:20.209
Aw. But the pigment
granules don't match.

33:20.644 --> 33:22.278
Okay, last ones.

33:22.313 --> 33:25.615
I'm gonna go track them
down in the leather room.

33:25.649 --> 33:29.451
Leather certainly bears further study.
It's a historical fetish.

33:29.486 --> 33:34.123
Think about it ...
corsets, dog collars ...

33:35.393 --> 33:38.796
...whips, belts...

33:53.646 --> 33:56.614
Is that Georgette?

33:56.649 --> 33:59.351
Particles of type "N"
mortar from the pool coping

33:59.385 --> 34:00.619
are embedded in the wound.

34:00.653 --> 34:03.388
She hit the side
and lost consciousness in the pool.

34:03.422 --> 34:05.090
- So, she was pushed in?
- Yes.

34:05.124 --> 34:09.261
I'm ruling it a homicide.
And take a look... at this.

34:09.295 --> 34:14.699
- Cubic zirconia?
- Hardly. Four carats, light yellow.

34:14.734 --> 34:18.570
It looks like "fl/if."

34:18.603 --> 34:20.237
Oh, no, that's a blemish.

34:20.273 --> 34:21.706
What kind of hooker gets paid in carats?

34:21.741 --> 34:25.443
- The girlfriend kind.
- Oh.

34:25.478 --> 34:28.213
So, Georgette must
have hung up her mask?

34:28.246 --> 34:31.349
Yeah. And no match on any of the
blond hairs from any of our call girls.

34:31.382 --> 34:32.350
Thank you.

34:32.384 --> 34:36.853
These are the results on the
jellylike substance on Neal's cloak.

34:36.888 --> 34:40.658
- It's calcium acetate.
- Otherwise known as?

34:40.692 --> 34:42.193
Canned butane gel.

34:42.226 --> 34:44.295
It's used in food
service to keep food warm.

34:44.329 --> 34:45.763
The caterers.

34:45.797 --> 34:48.199
That's why we couldn't match
the hair to a call girl.

34:48.233 --> 34:49.867
It's got to be from a caterer waiter.

34:49.902 --> 34:54.371
- There's a print here.
- Could be the victim's.

34:54.406 --> 34:58.275
I think a second person tried this
ring on. It's a different print.

35:04.825 --> 35:09.381
So, as financial chair, I want to assure you
your investments are healthy. 

35:09.415 --> 35:12.017
I recommend that we stay the
course with Murray & Bowman.

35:12.052 --> 35:14.386
We recommend you get
a new financial chair.

35:14.454 --> 35:15.654
Excuse me?

35:15.689 --> 35:17.790
You're under arrest for embezzling
your fellow teachers' pension money.

35:19.626 --> 35:22.295
What?
What did you do, Doug?

35:22.329 --> 35:24.864
Spent a bunch of money
on this diamond ring.

35:24.898 --> 35:27.299
Mm. Lucky you, Mrs. Gatz.

35:27.334 --> 35:29.936
Oh, wait.
That was for Georgette, wasn't it?

35:29.970 --> 35:31.771
I don't know what you're talking about.

35:31.805 --> 35:34.341
We found your prints on the ring.
We found Georgette's, too.

35:34.375 --> 35:35.909
You tried it on before you killed her.

35:35.944 --> 35:38.546
- Oh, god.
- We're thinking there was some pillow talk.

35:38.580 --> 35:40.081
You told Lori about
Neal's heart condition,

35:40.115 --> 35:42.083
his trouble getting it
up without an injection.

35:42.118 --> 35:45.453
Handy that you're a nurse, Lori.
Pretty, too.

35:45.488 --> 35:48.023
You snuck in with the catering,
and then you injected potassium chloride

35:48.058 --> 35:49.558
into the man who ruined your life.

35:49.593 --> 35:51.727
Did you know
Doug was having an affair?

35:51.761 --> 35:53.662
Or did you figure it out
after you killed Neal?

35:53.696 --> 35:55.464
This is insane.

35:55.498 --> 35:57.967
Yeah, that's what we
thought when we saw you push

35:57.968 --> 36:00.436
Georgette into the pool
on this surveillance tape.

36:00.470 --> 36:01.870
This is your fault.

36:01.905 --> 36:05.474
<i>- We don't have a surveillance tape.
- She doesn't know that.</i>

36:05.509 --> 36:07.343
You couldn't let go of
your high-school buddies.

36:07.378 --> 36:10.614
We were happy.
But you let Neal drag you in,

36:10.648 --> 36:12.349
show you this life you
thought you were missing.

36:12.383 --> 36:14.885
You fell in love with a whore.

36:14.919 --> 36:18.089
- Let's go, Lori.
- Hands behind your back.

36:24.963 --> 36:28.966
Cailin. Hi.
Come in.

36:31.036 --> 36:35.606
Do you know at the name "Cailin" means?

36:35.640 --> 36:38.910
- No.
- It means "uncertain."

36:38.944 --> 36:41.413
That's the name that
my mother picked for me.

36:41.447 --> 36:45.883
- "Maura" means "great."
- Yes, I know.

36:45.918 --> 36:50.922
- That's the name she picked for you.
- Cailin, please let me explain.

36:50.956 --> 36:52.590
Hmm.

36:52.624 --> 36:54.825
Can you explain why you called
my mother out of the blue

36:54.859 --> 36:57.760
with some bullshit story?

36:57.795 --> 37:00.163
This is very complicated.

37:00.197 --> 37:02.599
She's trying to bond with
me now, since I'm dying.

37:02.633 --> 37:05.802
You know, make up for all
those years she wasn't there.

37:05.836 --> 37:07.137
You're not going to die.

37:07.171 --> 37:11.141
"Don't ... don't do what I did, Cailin."

37:11.175 --> 37:12.876
Right.

37:12.911 --> 37:17.448
Like I'm gonna have time to...
fall in love...

37:18.851 --> 37:22.586
get pregnant...
have a baby...

37:24.522 --> 37:27.157
...hold that baby once
before she dies.

37:29.460 --> 37:33.029
You, um...
you put it back up.

37:34.866 --> 37:38.869
I went snooping.
I found it in the bathroom.

37:38.903 --> 37:42.439
I mean, it is my mother, isn't it?

37:42.474 --> 37:45.709
And that's ...
that's your gravestone...

37:45.743 --> 37:50.213
which is weird because...
you look okay to me.

37:50.248 --> 37:53.083
Please just let me explain.
I didn't mean for any of this to ...

37:53.117 --> 37:55.685
Do you have any idea what it's like

37:55.719 --> 37:58.521
to grow up in the
shadow of a dead baby?!

37:59.957 --> 38:02.559
I was never enough!

38:02.593 --> 38:06.829
You are more than enough.
She loves you.

38:06.864 --> 38:08.964
I know you think
I should have told her ...

38:08.999 --> 38:12.200
- I should have told the both of you, but I ...
- Yeah. Yeah.

38:12.235 --> 38:16.905
- I want to help you.
- I don't want your help!

38:18.575 --> 38:20.743
And I don't want your kidney, either.

38:23.046 --> 38:25.014
Yeah.

38:25.048 --> 38:29.652
Yeah, I...
I thought that was you.

38:32.556 --> 38:37.894
You just... you don't get
a match like that from a stranger.

38:37.928 --> 38:39.895
Cailin, please, don't throw your life away

38:39.930 --> 38:41.930
because of what you think of me.

38:43.666 --> 38:49.038
I don't want any part of you
living in me.

38:50.207 --> 38:54.178
Cailin!
What is going on?

38:54.213 --> 38:57.582
- You followed me?
- Well, you took our car.

38:57.617 --> 38:59.651
- So you called the police?
- Well...

39:01.554 --> 39:05.958
Hope... there's something
I need to tell you.

39:10.094 --> 39:12.229
I'm Paddy Doyle's daughter.

39:15.833 --> 39:16.967
What?

39:18.703 --> 39:20.103
I'm your daughter.

39:23.007 --> 39:25.209
I know that must be strange to hear.

39:25.243 --> 39:26.577
Don't say that.

39:27.713 --> 39:29.280
This is my daughter.

39:29.314 --> 39:32.016
Paddy told you that I died at birth.

39:32.050 --> 39:35.286
I am not looking
to be your daughter.

39:35.320 --> 39:37.288
I ...
I have a mother and a father.

39:37.322 --> 39:39.990
- I just wanted you to know...
- Just stop!

39:40.025 --> 39:41.625
I don't know who you
are or what you want,

39:41.660 --> 39:44.628
but I've had just about
as much as I can bear.

39:44.663 --> 39:50.101
Cailin. Honey.
Let's just go.

40:01.948 --> 40:03.916
I don't know what to say.

40:07.354 --> 40:13.926
Out of all the scenarios I thought of...
that wasn't one of them.

40:18.232 --> 40:22.602
She's in denial.
She's in shock.

40:22.637 --> 40:24.137
Imagine, how would you react

40:24.172 --> 40:26.606
if a grown woman walked
up to you and said...

40:26.640 --> 40:30.277
"How you doing?
I'm your... dead baby."

40:33.048 --> 40:34.615
And what about Cailin?

40:34.649 --> 40:37.285
If she doesn't let me
help her, she'll die.

40:37.319 --> 40:41.756
Maura, you can't force your kidney on her.

40:41.790 --> 40:45.660
I wish I could.

40:47.063 --> 40:52.334
I don't know. I never, ever
meant to cause them any pain.

40:52.368 --> 40:54.369
It's just so awful.

40:55.906 --> 40:58.407
Well, I tried to warn you.

40:58.442 --> 41:02.078
Family sucks.
Blow.

41:04.215 --> 41:05.348
No.

41:06.817 --> 41:09.786
No.
I'm all cried out. Okay?

41:09.821 --> 41:12.790
I'm done.

41:12.824 --> 41:16.193
I'm done.
And, actually, I'm a little insulted.

41:16.227 --> 41:21.432
- What'd I do?
- That girl rejected my kidney.

41:22.701 --> 41:23.801
The nerve.

41:23.836 --> 41:28.006
I know.
Right? It's a very nice kidney.

41:28.041 --> 41:29.742
I'm sure it is.

41:31.078 --> 41:34.013
You should keep it...
in your body.

41:35.282 --> 41:38.318
I'm just saying.
