00:10.111 --> 00:12.341
I was under the impression
the deal had closed.

00:12.747 --> 00:15.978
- Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry.
- I don't want "I'm sorry."

00:16.149 --> 00:19.381
I want to know how my father
beat me out of a $ 150 million contract...

00:19.553 --> 00:21.350
...that you assured me was a done deal.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.582
They'd only know the exact amount
if they had inside information.

00:24.759 --> 00:28.695
Since we were the only ones who knew it,
and I certainly didn't tell my father...

00:28.863 --> 00:31.263
...that leaves you
in a very uncomfortable position.

00:31.432 --> 00:36.301
If I no longer have your confidence,
I'll tender my resignation in the morning.

00:37.304 --> 00:40.603
My father would want
more than your resignation.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.208
He'd hobble you at the knees
and do everything in his power...

00:44.378 --> 00:47.279
...to ensure you'd never work
in the corporate world again.

00:51.085 --> 00:53.280
But I'm not my father.

00:55.423 --> 00:58.290
All I want to know is how he found out.

00:59.060 --> 01:02.291
And how I can stop it from
ever happening again.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.923
Lex, what's going on?

02:20.641 --> 02:24.543
Big Brother is listening,
or should I say Big Daddy.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.010
These are just what I've found so far.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.342
State-of-the-art,
high-tech surveillance.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.883
I'll have to get experts
to sweep the rest of the mansion.

02:32.052 --> 02:36.079
- Are you saying your dad's spying on you?
- I had a multimillion-dollar contract.

02:36.257 --> 02:40.660
The last minute, LuthorCorp manages
to underbid me. You do the math.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.897
- Lex, you gotta calm down...
- Don't tell me to calm down, Clark.

02:46.367 --> 02:49.666
How would you feel if someone listened
to every private word you uttered?

02:49.837 --> 02:52.169
Learning all your secrets?

03:09.557 --> 03:12.117
Lex. These devices could be anywhere.

03:12.293 --> 03:16.320
- In the sofa cushions, in the heating vents.
- I already checked.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.128
What about your stereo?

04:32.906 --> 04:35.466
Hey, Dad. Want me
to make this extra-crispy for you?

04:35.643 --> 04:39.909
No, thanks. And if I do say so myself,
I've cooked this bird to perfection.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.310
Just the way your mother likes it.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.479
Why aren't you going to Metropolis
for your anniversary?

04:45.653 --> 04:47.780
Well, last year while we were
out of town...

04:47.955 --> 04:50.719
...somebody had a party at our house.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.658
Well, you know what,
I think a picnic sounds perfect.

04:53.827 --> 04:57.024
So do I. But I can't go.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.434
Wait a minute, what do you mean
you can't go?

05:01.802 --> 05:05.363
Lionel just called. LuthorCorp's finalizing
a major acquisition tomorrow...

05:05.539 --> 05:09.168
...and he needs me to go with him
to his Metropolis office to prepare.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.743
Didn't you tell him
it's your anniversary, Mom?

05:11.912 --> 05:13.675
I'll be back tomorrow night.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.077
We can celebrate then,
any restaurant you want.

05:20.487 --> 05:23.047
You can't make me feel
any worse about it than I do.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.691
I know how hard you worked
planning today...

05:25.859 --> 05:28.953
...but I don't have a choice. He's my boss.
- I'm your husband.

05:30.397 --> 05:34.128
Believe me, I'd much rather
spend today with you.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.868
But this job is important to me.

05:38.038 --> 05:41.701
I never thought I'd see the day where this
job was more important than this family.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.400
- You shouldn't be working for Lionel Luthor.
- Clark.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.638
He only got this major acquisition
because he was spying on Lex.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.579
Clark. This is between
your mother and I.

05:51.185 --> 05:55.121
Jonathan, how many times have you put
this farm above our personal lives?

05:55.289 --> 05:57.723
- That is different, Martha.
- Why?

05:57.891 --> 06:03.056
I'm working toward the same goal:
Our family's financial security.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.994
I wish this job
didn't bother you so much.

06:14.441 --> 06:15.840
I have to go.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.725
All right, Lex. What's so urgent?

06:31.959 --> 06:35.656
Remember the new American Embassy
in Moscow, Dad?

06:36.130 --> 06:38.860
It was so riddled with
surveillance hardware...

06:39.032 --> 06:41.057
...the State Department
had to abandon it.

06:41.235 --> 06:44.363
I've got a meeting. I don't have time
to chat about foreign affairs.

06:44.538 --> 06:47.166
Actually, the topic is domestic.

06:47.341 --> 06:51.437
I've discovered a bug problem right here
in my very own home.

06:51.812 --> 06:55.373
Corporate espionage,
it's a fact of modern business, Lex.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.710
I'm surprised your security was so lax.

06:57.885 --> 07:02.652
It's still hard to imagine how the perpetrator
could have gained access to the mansion.

07:05.292 --> 07:08.784
Do I detect a faint whiff of innuendo?

07:08.962 --> 07:11.192
Of course not, Dad.

07:11.365 --> 07:14.061
I just wanted to congratulate you
on winning that contract.

07:14.234 --> 07:18.568
Oh, is that what this is about?
Making an excuse for your defeat.

07:19.673 --> 07:23.074
Because I don't have time for excuses.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.736
As for your bug problem...

07:28.382 --> 07:30.247
...I suggest you call an exterminator.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.576
- This is Mr. Green.
- I've finished the appraisal you requested.

07:57.744 --> 08:00.713
- We're ready to close escrow.
- How soon can you complete it?

08:00.881 --> 08:05.477
Today. We're here and ready to roll. You get
full access to the property, audio and video.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.017
Do we have a go?

08:11.391 --> 08:13.382
Mr. Green, are you there?

08:15.896 --> 08:18.023
- Mr. Green.
- Do it.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.558
We're on.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.044
You don't think it's too much?

08:40.687 --> 08:42.951
It depends who you're wearing it for.

08:43.590 --> 08:47.458
What do you call your newly discovered
biological father's wife?

08:49.096 --> 08:53.499
Well, personally, I'd call her Mrs. Small,
but that's just me.

08:54.835 --> 08:57.303
- So you're really going to see her.
- Yeah.

08:57.471 --> 09:02.602
Kind of feel like I'm auditioning.
What if she votes me off the island?

09:04.011 --> 09:07.947
Lana, anyone who gets to know you
realizes how special you are.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.346
Thanks, Clark.

09:14.521 --> 09:17.490
That's really sweet of you to say.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.960
You're always the one telling me
I need to be more honest.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.720
Yeah.

09:23.730 --> 09:27.393
Well, maybe you see me that way
because we're friends.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.969
But to Jennifer Small, I'm just
her husband's illegitimate daughter...

09:31.138 --> 09:33.129
...trying to worm her way into his life.

09:33.740 --> 09:38.234
Lana, if she accepts you, then great.
But if not, that's her loss.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.744
Isn't your priority Henry?
That's been going well.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.541
Yeah.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.878
But maybe it's the whole
"adopted kid fantasy" thing...

09:47.054 --> 09:50.182
...but I can't help thinking that
if I don't screw it up...

09:50.357 --> 09:52.188
...I might have an actual family.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.890
Look, Lana, I want you to have
everything you wish for, I really do.

09:58.065 --> 10:01.523
Just because you have a family
doesn't mean every day is a picnic.

10:01.868 --> 10:04.302
Unless, of course, you're a Kent.

10:05.539 --> 10:08.940
Well, to be honest, my parents aren't
really getting along right now.

10:09.309 --> 10:13.109
I'm sorry, Clark.
Do you want to talk about it?

10:13.747 --> 10:16.409
Later. You've got someplace to be.

10:18.885 --> 10:20.682
Okay.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.121
Clark.

10:29.029 --> 10:32.556
Whatever it is,
your parents will work it out.

10:35.068 --> 10:39.164
After all, some people
are just meant to be together.

10:54.788 --> 10:58.918
Lex. What's the most romantic restaurant
in Metropolis?

10:59.459 --> 11:01.791
I'm sure there are a lot opinions
on that, Clark...

11:01.962 --> 11:04.522
...but personally,
I'd have to go with La Petite Fleur.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.723
Could you score me a reservation
for tonight?

11:06.900 --> 11:10.267
- Who's the lucky girl?
- My mom. It's my parents' anniversary.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.895
My dad had a picnic,
but now she's in Metropolis with your dad.

11:14.074 --> 11:17.168
They're in Metropolis? At LuthorCorp?
On a Sunday?

11:17.344 --> 11:21.144
Yeah. Can you believe that he makes
her work on her anniversary?

11:21.314 --> 11:24.340
To my father, there's no such thing
as a personal life. Listen...

11:24.518 --> 11:27.612
...since it's their anniversary,
I could do better than reservations.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.653
What do you have in mind?

11:29.823 --> 11:33.156
Well, if you excuse me a minute
to make a few calls, I'll explain.

12:19.439 --> 12:22.101
Accessing database.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.643
- Kern.
- This is Green.

12:25.812 --> 12:28.280
I want you to terminate. Now.

12:28.448 --> 12:32.509
- You realize you'll forfeit the deposit.
- There are people in there. I want you out.

12:32.686 --> 12:34.347
I understand.

12:37.424 --> 12:42.191
Our client has canceled the project.
He believes there are people in the building.

12:45.699 --> 12:46.927
Hey, what are you doing?

12:47.100 --> 12:52.299
You think we broke into the office of one of
the richest men in the world to plant bugs?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.409
We ain't leaving this place
until we empty that vault.

12:59.513 --> 13:01.037
Bishop.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.314
Nicky. How long have
we worked together?

13:05.485 --> 13:08.511
We're not thieves.
We were hired to do a specific job.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.483
Job description's just been changed.

13:16.296 --> 13:20.494
Go out and check the other offices.
Bishop, get the torch.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.396
Sign here.

13:24.538 --> 13:26.631
Okay.

13:30.377 --> 13:33.005
- Martha?
- Yes.

13:34.781 --> 13:37.875
- Is something wrong?
- No.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.922
It's just that when you said
work couldn't wait till Monday...

13:43.089 --> 13:45.148
...I didn't think I'd be
the only one here.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.158
Thought you'd like to work
in your new office.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.397
New office? I don't understand.

13:52.566 --> 13:56.866
Look inside the top left-hand drawer
of the desk.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.607
Go ahead. Open it.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.594
Turn it over.

14:30.136 --> 14:33.401
"To Martha, with deep affection: L.L."

14:34.307 --> 14:39.677
I'm promoting you, Martha, which means
I'll be needing you more in Metropolis.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.906
Which means you'll need
someplace to work.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.715
Lionel...

14:46.186 --> 14:50.885
...I'm flattered, really,
but I can't accept this.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.687
And as far as working in Metropolis...

14:55.862 --> 14:59.889
...this job is putting enough strain
on my family as it is.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.707
Martha.

15:11.878 --> 15:14.904
I know how much you've given
up to be...

15:15.415 --> 15:18.851
...a farmer's wife,
but with your brains and your talent...

15:19.019 --> 15:24.321
...don't you deserve to make
your own ambitions a priority for a change?

15:25.091 --> 15:26.649
We'll discuss it over dinner.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.222
Hey, love birds.
Wrong place, wrong time.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.564
- Who is this? Martha?
- I don't know.

15:35.735 --> 15:40.172
Put your hands up.
Let's go! Get them in the air! Now!

15:42.909 --> 15:46.208
Clark. Clark!

15:46.379 --> 15:49.837
I don't suppose you know why there's
a helicopter parked in our front yard.

15:50.016 --> 15:53.076
Lex is gonna take you to Metropolis.
So you can take Mom to dinner.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.811
So this was your idea, was it?

15:55.388 --> 15:58.186
It was Clark's. I just offered
to provide the transportation.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.849
Look, I don't know how things work
in your house...

16:01.027 --> 16:03.996
...but we think it's important
to respect other people's privacy.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.562
- Dad.
- It's all right, Clark.

16:08.535 --> 16:12.665
Mr. Kent. Since the day
I moved to Smallville...

16:12.839 --> 16:15.307
...I've done nothing but try
to be a friend to you.

16:15.809 --> 16:20.473
And in return, you do nothing but lecture
me with sanctimonious platitudes.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.579
I'm done listening to them.

16:28.788 --> 16:31.723
- Dad, that was not fair.
- Everything was fine in this family...

16:31.891 --> 16:34.223
...until we let the Luthors
into our lives.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.421
- That wasn't Lex's fault.
- Hey!

16:36.596 --> 16:41.556
I appreciate your concern, but it is not
your responsibility to fix everything.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.232
So just stay out of it.

17:05.025 --> 17:08.461
Hey, Pyne. Got a little present for you.
Lionel Luthor.

17:09.896 --> 17:15.334
Good, you just saved us a whole lot of time.
Get him to open the vault.

17:15.502 --> 17:19.301
Too late, genius.
You already burned the plate.

17:27.781 --> 17:31.148
Access: Section Two.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.520
How the hell did the cops get tipped off?

17:48.702 --> 17:51.170
What have you got in your hand?

17:51.338 --> 17:55.399
- Open it up.
- Stop, you're hurting him. Lionel, please.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.878
Panic button, state of the art.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.749
Check him out.

18:08.889 --> 18:10.550
Let's go. Come on.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.917
A man in my position can never take
too many precautions.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.561
Why don't you just let us go?

18:15.729 --> 18:18.425
You can avoid adding kidnapping
to breaking and entering.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.227
You should listen to this woman.
I find her advice invariably sound.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.529
- I think he's all right.
- We should have left.

18:24.704 --> 18:28.003
If you'd kept to the plan,
none of this would have happened.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.511
- What's wrong with you?!
- Are you crazy?

18:36.683 --> 18:38.241
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

18:38.418 --> 18:40.750
- What are you doing?!
- Shut up!

18:40.921 --> 18:42.548
- Shut up!
- Drop it now!

18:42.722 --> 18:47.091
All right. All right, all right, all right.
Let's just settle down, okay?

18:47.260 --> 18:49.353
- Drop it, Pyne.
- Just relax.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.828
All right. Relax. Let's take it easy.

18:52.999 --> 18:57.095
I'm gonna put my guns down.
All right?

18:57.270 --> 19:00.728
Just gonna get the money,
and we're gonna get the hell out of here.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.645
Get back to work on that vault.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.813
You're wasting your time, you know.

19:18.692 --> 19:21.388
There's nothing in there of value
to any of you.

19:21.695 --> 19:25.426
Keep your eyes on them.
We'll need them later for leverage.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.371
- More coffee?
- Henry, why don't you get it?

19:42.549 --> 19:47.851
- Give Lana and I a chance to get a word in.
- Sure, I'll be right back.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.786
This really is a cute place, Lana.

19:58.064 --> 20:00.624
- You've got great taste.
- Thank you.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.827
And thank you for agreeing to meet with me.
I know it can't be easy for you.

20:05.305 --> 20:08.274
Lana, you seem like a very together
young woman...

20:08.441 --> 20:12.844
...which is why I feel
I can be completely candid with you.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.145
I don't want you
getting too close to Henry.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.287
Mrs. Small, I don't know
what you think...

20:23.456 --> 20:26.289
...but I am not trying to interfere
with your family.

20:26.459 --> 20:29.053
That's not what I'm worried about.

20:29.829 --> 20:34.061
Lana, when I married Henry,
he was the editor of the Law Review.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.498
He was gonna run for Congress.

20:36.670 --> 20:40.037
Now he runs a law practice
for lost causes out of our living room.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.639
He believes in what he's doing.

20:41.808 --> 20:46.211
Yeah, until it gets too difficult
or he loses interest.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.813
Which he always does.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.016
You think he'll lose interest in me.

20:55.188 --> 20:58.487
Henry has two children in boarding school.
He never calls them.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.992
And even when they're home,
he doesn't have time for them.

21:02.996 --> 21:04.691
Or anyone else.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.861
Why are you telling me this?

21:10.236 --> 21:12.568
I'm trying to do you a favor.

21:13.273 --> 21:18.006
I do not want to see you get hurt the next
time Henry's priorities suddenly change.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.114
So...

21:23.183 --> 21:25.913
...what have you two ladies
been talking about?

21:33.560 --> 21:37.587
We are live at the LuthorCorp Tower,
where sometime earlier this afternoon...

21:37.764 --> 21:40.892
...armed gunmen apparently entered
the building, and are now...

21:41.067 --> 21:45.060
...holding LuthorCorp chairman
and CEO Lionel Luthor hostage...

21:45.238 --> 21:49.038
...along with at least one
unidentified female employee.

21:49.209 --> 21:51.473
- Mom.
- Lf anybody tries to hurt your mother...

21:51.644 --> 21:54.135
- I'm not gonna let that happen.
- Clark. Clark!

21:56.216 --> 21:59.583
I'm not gonna try and stop you,
but I want you to be careful.

21:59.753 --> 22:02.381
I'm gonna follow you in the truck
and get there soon.

22:02.555 --> 22:07.720
Dad, there's a faster way for you to get
to Metropolis. You just have to talk to Lex.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.766
Get him out of here.

22:24.744 --> 22:27.907
- What?
- I hired you to bug an office...

22:28.081 --> 22:32.415
...not create a media circus.
- Yeah? Well, we ran into a little snag.

22:32.585 --> 22:36.385
- Who is this?
- Tell you what, Mr. Green.

22:36.556 --> 22:39.423
You show me your caller ID
and I'll show you mine.

22:39.592 --> 22:45.155
- I want to talk to Kern now.
- Kern's definitely not in charge anymore.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.073
Mr. Kent.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.943
I take it you've seen the news.

23:00.847 --> 23:05.784
If I hadn't been so bull-headed...

23:06.753 --> 23:09.187
...and taken you up on your offer...

23:10.023 --> 23:13.254
...Martha and I'd probably be
on our way to dinner.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.291
Instead...

23:18.665 --> 23:20.462
Believe me.

23:20.633 --> 23:23.067
There's plenty of blame to go around.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.842
Lex, I was wondering...

23:40.386 --> 23:42.980
- I was wondering if l...
- Sure, Mr. Kent.

23:45.191 --> 23:48.183
I'll give you a helicopter ride
to Metropolis.

24:13.353 --> 24:16.254
Young man, you too.
Stay behind the barricade.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.518
Let's go.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.736
Stand up and put your hands
on your head.

24:32.438 --> 24:33.996
Stand up!

24:35.041 --> 24:36.269
Turn around.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.535
I can explain.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.879
Hold still. Keep your fingers linked.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.678
I'm listening.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.977
My name is Clark Kent.
My mom's a hostage being held up there.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.749
Thought you'd play hero?
Assuming you're who you say...

24:51.925 --> 24:55.725
...you almost got your mom killed.
Every opening in there is wired with alarms.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.863
The kidnappers control
the security system.

24:58.031 --> 25:01.899
And they've threatened to shoot hostages
if anyone so much as sets a big toe inside.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.897
Come on, hero.
You're coming with me.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.362
Move it!

25:11.377 --> 25:15.074
So, what are we gonna do?
They saw you kill Kern.

25:15.248 --> 25:17.182
They can ID us, Pyne.

25:17.350 --> 25:20.012
And I for one am not going down
for murder. Understand me?

25:20.186 --> 25:23.349
We will deal with them
when the time comes.

25:27.227 --> 25:29.388
I know what you're thinking.

25:29.562 --> 25:34.590
If I hadn't asked you to work today, you'd
be at home right now with your family.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.663
I don't blame you, Lionel.

25:39.205 --> 25:42.470
It's just that Jonathan and I
left on such bad terms.

25:43.810 --> 25:49.373
That's ironic. I had quite a row
this morning too with Lex.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.980
If they kill us...

25:52.318 --> 25:55.310
...those will be the last words
we ever spoke to each other.

26:05.465 --> 26:08.059
Pyne, you're up.

26:41.334 --> 26:43.302
What the hell is this?

26:58.718 --> 27:01.380
I want you to monitor the radio channels.
Nothing gets...

27:01.554 --> 27:03.784
It's okay. It's okay.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.748
Clark?

27:06.359 --> 27:09.522
- You know this kid?
- Yes, ma'am. He's my son.

27:09.696 --> 27:13.632
Okay, you keep him away from the building
or I'll arrest him. All right?

27:14.033 --> 27:15.796
- Lieutenant, I'm...
- I know who you are.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.732
I'd appreciate an update
on the negotiations.

27:20.340 --> 27:22.069
This way.

27:26.379 --> 27:28.347
- What happened?
- I listened to the police.

27:28.514 --> 27:30.914
- I found a way into the building.
- Really, how?

27:31.084 --> 27:33.450
No one's watching the Daily Planet.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.824
- You're not thinking about jumping.
- It's the only way.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.656
- Clark, that's gotta be over 200 feet.
- I can make it.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.061
You don't know that.

27:47.667 --> 27:51.626
- Besides, don't you have a fear of heights?
- Lf we're not here to get Mom, then why?

27:52.004 --> 27:56.134
Listen to me. I am just as concerned
about your mother as you are.

27:56.309 --> 27:59.676
But we can't afford to make a mistake
that could get her killed.

28:17.630 --> 28:19.495
Where's the damn money?

28:19.665 --> 28:23.157
I told you there was nothing
in there of interest to you.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.643
Check this out.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.048
Could be worth something.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.409
What the hell is this?

29:07.013 --> 29:11.916
Martha, perhaps the gentleman
hasn't noticed...

29:12.084 --> 29:13.608
...that I'm blind.

29:13.786 --> 29:17.347
Would you mind telling me
what he's referring to?

29:19.826 --> 29:21.191
It's...

29:21.360 --> 29:26.024
...some sort of metallic disk,
shaped like an octagon.

29:26.432 --> 29:29.162
It's nothing, a keepsake.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.748
- Sawyer.
- Where is my transportation?

29:48.921 --> 29:53.551
I told you, I need a show of good faith first.
You give me one of those hostages.

29:53.726 --> 29:55.717
Okay.

29:56.329 --> 29:58.229
Fine.

29:58.598 --> 30:00.395
Get up.

30:03.336 --> 30:07.739
You got 10 minutes, then you can
take this one out in a body bag.

30:08.407 --> 30:12.503
We're working on it. Stay cool up there.
Stay cool.

31:02.295 --> 31:05.287
Whatever you do, don't hurt any
of the hostages. Just stay calm.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.466
Yeah, well, how am I supposed
to stay calm, huh?

31:09.069 --> 31:11.936
I opened up that damn vault expecting
my retirement fund...

31:12.105 --> 31:16.439
...and instead I find a bunch of files,
green rocks all cut up into bars.

31:16.609 --> 31:18.975
- What else was in there?
- What's it to you?

31:19.145 --> 31:21.841
Answer me and maybe I can help you.

31:22.649 --> 31:24.947
I don't know. Just what I told you.

31:25.118 --> 31:28.053
Oh, and some metal
octagon-Iooking thing.

31:29.956 --> 31:34.416
Listen to me. Pack up everything.
The files, the bars, the octagon.

31:34.594 --> 31:35.822
Yeah, then what?

31:37.363 --> 31:41.493
I know a way out of the building.
But first, you let the hostages go.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.717
Pyne?

33:12.892 --> 33:14.883
Better take a look at this.

33:16.529 --> 33:19.498
- We got company.
- Check it out.

33:24.571 --> 33:28.268
A window just blew out on the 30th floor.
Get the team together, we're going in.

33:28.441 --> 33:30.409
Let's go. Move it.

33:34.747 --> 33:35.975
What the hell's going on?

33:36.149 --> 33:39.243
Sounds like a chunk in that safe
is worth something to you.

33:39.419 --> 33:43.412
Tell you what, I want a million dollars
and I want a way out of here.

33:43.590 --> 33:48.084
- You're in no position to negotiate.
- This is not a negotiation. All right?

33:48.261 --> 33:51.094
We get out of here or nobody does.

33:51.965 --> 33:54.126
All right, listen to me.

33:55.368 --> 33:57.529
Luthor has a private elevator.

33:57.704 --> 34:01.367
It'll take you to a tunnel that leads
to a garage three blocks away.

34:01.541 --> 34:04.704
Hey, Lionel. You been holding out on me?

34:04.877 --> 34:07.607
Is there some kind of secret way
out of here?

34:09.349 --> 34:10.679
Oh, yes.

34:12.085 --> 34:16.351
And whatever that anonymous coward,
your Mr. Green, is offering...

34:17.257 --> 34:18.518
...I'll double it...

34:19.993 --> 34:21.858
...in exchange for our lives...

34:22.027 --> 34:24.518
...and the contents of the safe.

34:26.966 --> 34:29.491
Hear that, Green? Looks like
we got us a bidding war.

34:29.668 --> 34:32.502
Look, no matter what Luthor is promising,
you can't trust him.

34:32.672 --> 34:37.574
Oh, but I should trust you?
Somebody who hides his own identity?

34:37.810 --> 34:40.540
Think I'd rather deal with Lionel.

34:40.713 --> 34:43.341
I'll match what he's offering,
just don't hurt them.

34:51.591 --> 34:54.081
Don't hurt who, Lex?

35:01.134 --> 35:04.365
- Were you talking to those men up there?
- Mr. Kent...

35:04.537 --> 35:08.735
...whatever I'm doing is in the best interest
of your wife and my father. Believe me.

35:09.876 --> 35:13.437
If I find out that you had anything to do
with what's going on out here...

35:13.946 --> 35:18.007
...you will pray to God you never set
foot in Smallville. You believe me.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.472
Where's my mom? Where is she?!

35:46.746 --> 35:51.183
So as soon as the banks open,
I'll have the money wired...

35:51.617 --> 35:54.814
...to any account you choose,
anywhere in the world.

35:58.091 --> 36:00.355
- All right, we got a deal.
- Good.

36:00.526 --> 36:03.051
But I'm hanging on to everything
till I get that money.

36:03.563 --> 36:05.190
All right.

36:08.835 --> 36:10.826
Bishop, pack up the stuff in the vault.

36:11.003 --> 36:13.335
So you'll tell who's on
the other end of the line?

36:13.506 --> 36:17.272
You'd probably know better than I do.
Why don't you think who your enemies are?

36:19.445 --> 36:22.073
Come on, lady, you can help out too.
Pick up the files.

36:23.483 --> 36:25.280
Come on!

36:35.261 --> 36:36.956
Today! Come on!

36:37.130 --> 36:42.261
- Pick them up and put them with the rest.
- Okay, I'm picking them up. I...

36:46.939 --> 36:50.170
All right, that's good.
Get over there and help your boss up.

36:50.710 --> 36:52.473
Lionel.

36:54.814 --> 37:00.218
- Martha. The octagonal disk, where is it?
- I don't know. Why is it so important?

37:00.386 --> 37:02.946
Come on, time's up. Let's go. Move.

37:03.122 --> 37:04.521
Move, move!

37:10.430 --> 37:11.795
What the hell happened?

37:11.964 --> 37:14.592
The cops cut the power.
We've gotta go!

37:14.767 --> 37:16.496
Bishop, don't!

37:24.777 --> 37:28.235
Clark! Get out of here now!

37:32.752 --> 37:34.549
Clark!

37:42.462 --> 37:44.191
Clark!

37:54.908 --> 37:57.138
Are you alone?

37:58.111 --> 37:59.738
Answer me, are you alone?

38:16.062 --> 38:20.192
Clark! Clark. Are you all right?

38:20.867 --> 38:27.170
Lady, you and the kid get up, put your
hands over your head, or I kill the old man.

38:49.896 --> 38:51.727
He's dead.

38:57.904 --> 39:00.338
Clark. Those files over there, burn them.

39:00.673 --> 39:03.471
There's one about you.
We can't let it get out.

39:16.156 --> 39:20.115
Metropolis P.D., nobody move!
Hands where I can see them!

39:59.732 --> 40:01.290
Clark.

40:01.467 --> 40:05.130
- How did you get inside?
- The boy's resourceful, Lex.

40:05.305 --> 40:09.935
What difference does it make how he did it?
He saved us, that's what's important.

40:10.109 --> 40:11.838
Dad.

40:13.112 --> 40:15.410
I did everything I could
to secure your release.

40:15.582 --> 40:18.676
No, I'm sure you did a great deal.

40:21.521 --> 40:24.547
I'll send someone to the mansion
for my things.

40:25.792 --> 40:27.419
I'll help them pack.

40:31.631 --> 40:33.360
Thank you.

41:19.946 --> 41:22.278
- What's that?
- It's my resignation.

41:22.682 --> 41:25.617
There's no way I can keep working
for Lionel.

41:25.785 --> 41:30.745
He had refined meteor rocks in his vault,
a file on Clark. I can't believe I trusted him.

41:30.923 --> 41:34.256
Without that file, at least the police
can't find out anything about me.

41:35.161 --> 41:37.425
To think I made this job
such a big priority...

41:37.597 --> 41:41.260
...and Lionel may have only hired me
to learn more about Clark.

41:42.502 --> 41:46.268
Sorry, Mom. I know how important
your work has been to you.

41:47.240 --> 41:49.174
It's not more important than you.

41:50.376 --> 41:52.071
Wait.

41:53.079 --> 41:55.479
Are you sure that this
is the best thing to do?

41:55.748 --> 41:57.409
- Quit, I mean.
- What do you mean?

41:57.583 --> 41:59.175
I thought you'd be happy about it.

41:59.686 --> 42:01.517
If you hadn't been working
for Lionel...

42:01.688 --> 42:05.419
...then we'd have no way of knowing
that he was keeping tabs on Clark.

42:05.825 --> 42:08.191
So instead of staying away
from him...

42:08.361 --> 42:11.353
Maybe we should take a page
out of the Luthor playbook.

42:42.228 --> 42:45.925
- Sweetheart. You coming up?
- In a minute.
