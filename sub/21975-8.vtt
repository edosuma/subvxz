looks like today?

18:10.756 --> 18:13.091
{\an3}- I would say
it's a 95% chance

18:13.175 --> 18:14.968
{\an3}she looks
just like that.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.136
{\an1}- 95%?

18:16.220 --> 18:16.512
{\an3}- Mm-hmm.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.180
{\an1}- Okay.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.724
<i>I didn't know if</i>
<i>I'd ever fully understand</i>

18:20.808 --> 18:22.518
<i>the science</i>
<i>of age progression,</i>

18:22.601 --> 18:23.811
<i>but it was</i>
<i>the best clue we had</i>

18:23.894 --> 18:26.855
<i>as to what a 76-year-old</i>
<i>Frances might look like.</i>

18:26.939 --> 18:28.982
<i>So I brought Bill</i>
<i>the updated photo</i>

18:29.066 --> 18:31.360
<i>to see what he thought.</i>

18:31.443 --> 18:33.320
- Oh, my gosh.

18:33.403 --> 18:36.365
- That's what we got.

18:38.158 --> 18:40.244
I don't know if
it's 100% accurate,

18:40.327 --> 18:42.412
but there's not that many
age progressionists around,

18:42.496 --> 18:46.708
so, you know, we have to take
what we can get, I guess.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.712
- Who did this?

18:50.796 --> 18:52.548
- Cornelius Ladd.

18:52.631 --> 18:56.051
<i>If there was a chance Frances</i>
<i>still lived in the area,</i>

18:56.134 --> 18:58.720

<i>to do a poster campaign</i>

18:58.804 --> 19:01.223
<i>while we chased down</i>
<i>other leads.</i>

19:01.306 --> 19:03.058
<i>So we put up</i>
<i>hundreds of fliers</i>

19:06.603 --> 19:08.480

<i>to relocate from the hotel</i>

19:11.108 --> 19:12.818
<i>to his niece Shelly's house,</i>

19:12.901 --> 19:14.820

19:14.903 --> 19:16.738
<i>She invited him</i>
<i>to stay with her,</i>

<i>gain insight</i>

<i>more importantly, Frances.</i>

19:24.371 --> 19:26.081
- Hi.
- Hello!

19:26.164 --> 19:28.750
- Hey, there.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.378
- How are you?

19:31.461 --> 19:32.546
{\an3}- Fine.
Good to see you.

19:32.629 --> 19:34.423
- Good to see you.
Oh.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.009
Y'all come on in.

19:37.092 --> 19:39.261

northwest Arkansas.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.470

- Who?

19:40.554 --> 19:42.306

- Oh, yeah.

19:42.389 --> 19:46.268

19:46.351 --> 19:47.936
So we're--
we're good.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.771
Chris and I are finally
empty nesters.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.607
- Finally got
freedom, huh?

19:51.690 --> 19:53.609
- Yeah, that's right.
That's right.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.611
So, no, but we're doing
good, so...

19:55.694 --> 19:57.321
- Well, that color

19:57.404 --> 19:59.948
you didn't have that
when I was here, did you?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.867
{\an3}- I did have that
when you were here, yeah.

20:01.950 --> 20:03.076
- That's nice.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.786
- Thank you.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.872
-<i> After some catching up</i>
<i>with Shelly,</i>

20:06.955 --> 20:09.833
<i>Bill headed upstairs to his</i>
<i>grand-nephew Dakota's bedroom</i>

20:09.917 --> 20:11.793
<i>to unpack</i>
<i>and get settled.</i>

20:11.877 --> 20:14.046
<i>Meanwhile, Shelly brought me</i>
<i>into the kitchen</i>

20:14.129 --> 20:16.089
<i>to show me some</i>
<i>old family albums.</i>

20:16.173 --> 20:17.758
That's Bill?
- That's Bill.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.301
Isn't he cute?
- Look at that haircut.

20:19.384 --> 20:19.968
- [laughs]
Look at that hat.

20:20.052 --> 20:24.139
{\an1}So this is
Easter 1939,

20:24.222 --> 20:24.973

20:25.057 --> 20:27.142
- What a cutie.
- I know.

20:27.225 --> 20:30.312
{\an1}That's a picture
of him in, I think--

20:30.395 --> 20:31.480
- This is Bill?

20:31.563 --> 20:32.898
- Uh-huh,
in his younger years.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.775
- No.
- Yeah.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.485
Look at that hair.

20:36.568 --> 20:36.944
- Oh, my God.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.654
- Mm-hmm.

20:38.737 --> 20:42.199
-<i> I was stunned to see that Bill</i>
<i>was once incredibly handsome,</i>

20:42.282 --> 20:43.992
<i>and for the first time,</i>
<i>his Hollywood aspirations</i>

20:44.076 --> 20:46.662
<i>started to make sense.</i>

20:46.745 --> 20:48.497
<i>So I was hopeful Shelly would</i>
<i>be able to shine more light</i>

20:48.580 --> 20:51.041
<i>on this man who left</i>
<i>the love of his life</i>

20:51.124 --> 20:53.585
<i>for a shot at fame.</i>

20:53.669 --> 20:56.380
- Bill's dad died
when he was five years old,

20:56.463 --> 20:59.174
and his dad,
I think,

20:59.257 --> 21:01.051
was in his 50s
when he died,

21:01.134 --> 21:01.635
so he was fairly young.

21:01.718 --> 21:03.345
- Huh.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.431
- And he really struggled
emotionally

21:06.515 --> 21:09.309
trying to
deal with that.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.395
And I think there's just
different points of his life

21:11.478 --> 21:13.522
that he just kind of felt,
you know,

21:13.605 --> 21:18.193
that maybe he's been entitled
to certain things,

21:18.276 --> 21:20.487
and life doesn't always
work out that way.

21:20.570 --> 21:24.658
I think that's harder for him
to move past.

21:24.741 --> 21:28.120
- Bill's memories about Frances
are very foggy...

21:28.203 --> 21:29.329
- Mm-hmm.
- And vague...

21:29.413 --> 21:30.914
- Mm-hmm.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.375
- And there's a lot of
half information.

21:33.458 --> 21:37.337
And so I was hoping maybe you
might know stuff or--

21:37.421 --> 21:39.715
Has he mentioned her
to you?

21:39.798 --> 21:42.217
- Briefly, but, yeah,
briefly, he has.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.886
Evidently, I think
he dated her,

21:44.970 --> 21:46.596
and my grandmother
didn't want him to marry her.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.056
Is that what
he's told you?

21:48.140 --> 21:49.683
- He said something
like that, yeah.

21:49.766 --> 21:52.477
I get a sense he really regrets
not marrying her.

21:52.561 --> 21:53.562
{\an3}- Yes.

21:53.645 --> 21:54.479
- He says he should have
married her.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.898
- And Bill keeps
in touch with--

21:56.982 --> 21:58.525
I mean, you know, he has his
little, literally, black book,

21:58.608 --> 22:01.945
and he keeps in touch
with a lot of people--

22:02.029 --> 22:03.447
relatives, friends.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.950
He's very, very good
about that.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.494
So the fact that
he lost touch with her

22:09.578 --> 22:11.413
is kind of interesting
to me.

22:11.496 --> 22:14.416
-<i> It was curious that Shelly,</i>
<i>who knew Bill so well,</i>

22:14.499 --> 22:17.169

any impersonations.

{\an1}- [laughs]
It's good to see you again.

01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:29.384
{\an1}It's an interesting
little place.

01:21:29.467 --> 01:21:32.679
- On the map
it was blue,

01:21:32.762 --> 01:21:35.515
{\an3}so I thought it would be
a nice river, but--

01:21:35.599 --> 01:21:38.602
{\an3}- Yeah, I thought we were
gonna drive trucks.

01:21:38.685 --> 01:21:39.436
{\an3}- Yeah.

01:21:39.519 --> 01:21:43.815
[laughter]

01:21:51.031 --> 01:21:52.657
- You good with that?

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:53.700
- Mm-hmm.

01:21:53.783 --> 01:21:55.327
{\an1}- You and your
super-cold hands.

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:56.828
- Thanks for
warming them up.

01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:59.998
{\an1}- No problem.
[giggles]

01:22:03.001 --> 01:22:05.462
It's kind of weird having
cameras around, right?

01:22:05.545 --> 01:22:08.465
- We can turn them off
if you want.

01:22:08.548 --> 01:22:09.299
- [laughs]

01:22:09.382 --> 01:22:11.635
Could we?

01:22:11.718 --> 01:22:12.677
- Do you want to?

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:14.387
- [laughs]

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:15.513
I feel like that--does
that defeat the purpose maybe?

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:17.349
- Of what?

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:19.392
- I don't know.

01:22:19.476 --> 01:22:21.353
- What's the purpose?

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:24.564
- You're filming
something.

01:22:24.648 --> 01:22:27.067
It's kind of
the purpose, right?
