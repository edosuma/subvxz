Previously on "Heartland":

00:03.132 --> 00:04.769
Potable water?

00:04.804 --> 00:06.967
Are you trying to tell me you
had nothing to do with that?

00:09.305 --> 00:11.610
Oh! Sorry, I gotta get going.

00:11.645 --> 00:12.525
Hot date?

00:12.560 --> 00:15.748
If it was, would that bother you?

00:22.071 --> 00:23.712
Georgie, what happened?

00:23.747 --> 00:26.089
Adam was at the party with
Olivia and they were...

00:26.124 --> 00:28.290
they were kissing.

00:48.526 --> 00:51.350
Okay. That should be enough.

00:59.952 --> 01:02.114
How does she sound?

01:02.180 --> 01:05.328
Her breathing is pretty
laboured after the exercise.

01:05.418 --> 01:07.150
Should we try treating her?

01:07.924 --> 01:10.008
Yeah... Let's get her into the barn.

01:10.043 --> 01:11.576
Okay.

01:15.311 --> 01:17.311
What the...?

01:25.526 --> 01:28.932
- I'm finished G.G.
- Okay, just give me a minute.

01:28.998 --> 01:30.865
You said we could throw rocks in the pond.

01:30.900 --> 01:33.413
We will, as soon as I
finish reading this article.

01:33.448 --> 01:36.798
Okay, I'm off to Maggie's.

01:36.949 --> 01:39.794
- Did you call Adam?
- Mm!

01:39.829 --> 01:41.765
Seriously? You forgot to
cancel my tutoring session?

01:41.800 --> 01:43.122
- Was that today?
- Yes!

01:43.157 --> 01:44.765
And he's gonna be here in fifteen minutes,

01:44.800 --> 01:46.416
and he's always early!

01:46.451 --> 01:47.332
How could you forget?

01:47.367 --> 01:50.023
Okay, I guess I'll be finishing this later.

01:50.058 --> 01:51.440
- I'm sorry, It's just been so busy.
- Yay!

01:51.475 --> 01:53.205
Maybe I can catch him before he leaves.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.066
Oh, wait, one sec. Hello, Mitch.

01:55.101 --> 01:57.247
Did you, uh, manage to fix
the lock on the main cabin?

01:57.282 --> 01:59.125
Well, good morning to you too.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.185
I'm, uh, I'm actually at
the Dude Ranch right now...

02:01.220 --> 02:03.129
I thought you were gonna
deal with that yesterday?

02:03.164 --> 02:04.284
Well, something came up.

02:04.319 --> 02:07.022
- Come on, honey.
- Lou, who stayed here last night?

02:07.057 --> 02:09.872
Uh, a group of guys, pretty young.

02:09.907 --> 02:11.036
It was a fishing trip or something.

02:11.071 --> 02:13.165
- Did they already check out?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why?

02:13.200 --> 02:16.948
Uh, I think you better get down
here and see this for yourself.

02:16.983 --> 02:18.160
Mitch, I don't have time to play games.

02:18.195 --> 02:20.285
Would you please just tell
me what you're talking about?

02:20.320 --> 02:23.744
- Hello? Lou?
- What? Mitch?

02:23.779 --> 02:25.100
Sorry, I think my battery's gonna die.

02:25.135 --> 02:28.303
Hello? I think he hung up on me.

02:30.084 --> 02:32.050
Hey! Where are you going?! What about Adam?

02:32.086 --> 02:33.301
I'll call him on the way.

02:38.224 --> 02:41.725
Oh no! Don't let her leave!

02:41.760 --> 02:43.901
Don't let her leave!

02:43.936 --> 02:44.483
What?

02:44.518 --> 02:46.641
I don't need your help
with the science test.

02:46.676 --> 02:49.037
Uh, yeah you do. You have a "C" average,

02:49.072 --> 02:51.409
and to me, "C" stands for complacency.

02:51.444 --> 02:53.722
Well, to me, it stands
for complete waste of time.

02:53.757 --> 02:56.038
Well, my mother can't pick
me up for a few hours, so...

02:56.073 --> 02:58.313
Adam, I'm sorry about the
miscommunication, okay?

02:58.348 --> 02:59.777
- But since he's already here...
- Mom!

02:59.812 --> 03:01.942
Look, it won't hurt to brush
up a little for the test.

03:01.977 --> 03:03.169
I'll be back from the Dude Ranch soon.

03:03.234 --> 03:06.972
And Adam, I'll give you a ride
home on my way into Maggie's, okay?

03:10.042 --> 03:11.573
No wonder she's afraid of this thing.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.951
She's gonna look like Horse Vader.

03:12.986 --> 03:15.827
I know, but she needs the steroids
for her airway obstruction,

03:15.862 --> 03:17.410
and this is the only way
to get it into her lungs.

03:17.445 --> 03:19.082
Okay, well, how long do we keep it on?

03:19.117 --> 03:21.873
Twenty minutes, twice
a day, if she'll let us.

03:21.947 --> 03:23.215
We'll give it a try.

03:23.295 --> 03:26.430
Hey, girl, this is gonna
help you breathe better, okay?

03:26.504 --> 03:27.870
Be good.

03:31.217 --> 03:33.404
- One more time?
- Here you go.

03:33.486 --> 03:35.919
It's okay.

03:37.143 --> 03:39.042
Okay.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.729
This is exactly what she
was doing at the clinic.

03:41.764 --> 03:43.996
Well, we just have to be patient.

03:44.031 --> 03:46.628
We have to earn her
trust. I'll do some TTouch.

03:46.701 --> 03:50.083
Okay, thanks. I'm gonna make
some more notes in her file.

03:50.973 --> 03:52.339
Hey...

04:08.109 --> 04:10.519
She seems to have settled a little.

04:10.554 --> 04:11.514
Mm-hmm?

04:11.549 --> 04:13.178
What's in the box?

04:13.213 --> 04:16.447
Nothing. Just something
from the... from the clinic.

04:17.401 --> 04:19.094
We should get back to Penelope.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.182
Yeah. I was just gonna see if
you wanted to check her lungs.

04:21.216 --> 04:22.658
She seems a bit calmer now.

04:22.693 --> 04:24.733
- Yeah, that's a good idea. Let's do that.
- Okay.

04:34.605 --> 04:36.038
Oh...

04:37.419 --> 04:40.297
Oh. My. God.

05:24.380 --> 05:25.795
You know, it's ironic.

05:25.830 --> 05:28.278
If you let me keep my trailer here,
none of this would've ever happened.

05:28.313 --> 05:30.554
- I'm not in the mood, okay?
- Oh, come on, lighten up.

05:30.589 --> 05:31.593
It's not funny.

05:31.628 --> 05:33.485
Really? You don't see any humour in this?

05:33.520 --> 05:36.163
No, I don't. And neither should
you since this is your fault.

05:36.198 --> 05:37.214
- My fault?!
- Yeah!

05:37.249 --> 05:39.107
You were supposed to be here last night.

05:39.142 --> 05:41.808
What came up, another online match-up?

05:43.493 --> 05:44.544
Wow. Really.

05:44.579 --> 05:47.530
Look, what I do on my
own time is my business.

05:47.565 --> 05:48.108
Mm-hmm.

05:48.143 --> 05:51.110
Besides, I wouldn't be surprised
if you brought this on yourself.

05:51.217 --> 05:52.241
Excuse me?!

05:52.276 --> 05:55.883
I don't know. Did you say anything to these
guys to make 'em want to get back at you?

05:55.938 --> 05:57.940
- No, I didn't!
- Are you sure?

05:57.975 --> 06:00.446
Yes, I'm sure! God!

06:00.508 --> 06:02.456
I mean, they might have
given me a little attitude

06:02.491 --> 06:04.245
when I brought up the house rules, but...

06:04.280 --> 06:05.898
The what?

06:05.993 --> 06:08.995
The house rules. It's a small handout.

06:09.030 --> 06:11.000
It's more like a list of suggestions.

06:11.035 --> 06:13.840
Uh... does it look like this?

06:13.875 --> 06:14.998
You're kidding me.

06:15.033 --> 06:16.835
"House rules."

06:16.947 --> 06:19.506
I guess they didn't think
too much of your suggestions.

06:19.562 --> 06:21.065
Oh my God, those little...

06:21.100 --> 06:23.170
You know, to be fair, it
doesn't say anything on here

06:23.205 --> 06:25.372
about rearranging the furniture.

06:28.852 --> 06:31.153
Okay, let's go over the periodic table.

06:31.235 --> 06:32.868
I already know it by heart.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.970
You can't just memorize it, you have
to know why it's organized that way.

06:36.005 --> 06:38.333
It's all about incorporating
recurring trends.

06:38.368 --> 06:39.296
Here's a recurring trend:

06:39.331 --> 06:42.321
these study sessions keep
getting more and more boring.

06:42.356 --> 06:45.190
I'm sorry. I didn't realize I
was being paid to entertain you.

06:45.225 --> 06:48.488
Entertain me? I'd settle
for not putting me to sleep.

06:51.285 --> 06:53.785
- You wanna hear a joke?
- No, not really.

06:53.820 --> 06:56.352
What do you do with a sick chemist?

06:57.852 --> 07:00.453
Well, if you can't helium,
and you can't curium,

07:00.488 --> 07:03.155
then you might as well barium.

07:06.982 --> 07:09.076
She's still pretty congested,

07:09.111 --> 07:10.944
but she's a lot more relaxed.

07:10.979 --> 07:13.246
Mm. She doesn't have an issue

07:13.281 --> 07:16.549
with me touching her anywhere on her face.

07:16.701 --> 07:19.001
So what's the problem with the mask then?

07:19.330 --> 07:21.625
I don't know, it... it
could be that she has a fear

07:21.660 --> 07:24.728
of something being over her face?

07:25.240 --> 07:26.547
I'd like to check her file,

07:26.582 --> 07:28.571
see if there's anything
I might have missed.

07:28.759 --> 07:29.987
Yeah, sure. It's open on my desk.

07:30.022 --> 07:31.026
Okay.

07:52.427 --> 07:53.260
Hey.

07:53.388 --> 07:54.466
Hey!

07:54.763 --> 07:56.396
What're you doing with that?

08:05.459 --> 08:06.992
Where were you?

08:07.121 --> 08:08.312
Uh... here.

08:08.347 --> 08:12.483
Well, Katie and I just got back from
having a little fun down at the pond and...

08:12.518 --> 08:15.686
Jack, we had an appointment at my lawyers.

08:15.721 --> 08:19.823
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.

08:19.858 --> 08:22.035
Did you forget to turn
on your phone as well?

08:22.117 --> 08:25.277
- No.
- You haven't answered one of my calls!

08:25.712 --> 08:29.496
You see this button right here?

08:29.575 --> 08:32.542
You just push this button.
How hard can that be?

08:32.621 --> 08:34.755
Okay, I got it.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.655
I get that you don't
want to deal with this,

08:36.690 --> 08:38.866
but I've worked very
hard to build my business.

08:38.900 --> 08:40.289
I know you have...

08:40.323 --> 08:43.043
And I... if anything happens to me...

08:43.078 --> 08:45.056
want you to take on Fairfield.

08:45.091 --> 08:48.654
What? I'm not in the horse
breeding business, you know that!

08:48.689 --> 08:51.258
It's not about you. We have grandchildren.

08:51.293 --> 08:54.352
We have great grandchildren, God help us,

08:54.459 --> 08:56.101
and I'm thinking about their future!

08:56.136 --> 09:00.143
Okay, I get it, Lise, but
I'm not trying to avoid this.

09:00.178 --> 09:04.666
I ju-I don't understand why you're in
such a big rush to go over your will?

09:04.701 --> 09:06.349
I mean, you're young, and you're healthy...

09:06.384 --> 09:09.149
No, no, that's not the point.

09:09.322 --> 09:11.721
The point is that anything
could happen at any time

09:11.756 --> 09:14.404
and I want the family to be taken care of,

09:14.439 --> 09:16.516
and I need your help to do that!

09:16.551 --> 09:22.114
And that's tough to do when you can't even
be bothered to show up at an appointment!

09:23.021 --> 09:25.065
I'm gonna take a walk.

09:29.533 --> 09:31.827
Ty! Hey, I... I didn't mean to snoop.

09:31.862 --> 09:32.690
- Can we...
- But you're acting so weird...

09:32.725 --> 09:33.857
Okay, can we just get back to work?

09:33.892 --> 09:36.977
- No. I-I know what it is.
- What?

09:37.012 --> 09:39.410
It's an anniversary present.
I think that's so sweet!

09:39.445 --> 09:42.695
- No. It-It isn't, Amy.
- Oh, you are not a very good liar.

09:42.730 --> 09:43.477
- Come...
- I'm serious, Amy.

09:43.512 --> 09:44.988
I think we can open it a bit early...

09:45.023 --> 09:45.764
- I'm not kidding, okay?
- 'Cause you know me...

09:45.799 --> 09:49.337
I'm not kidding! It's not for you. It's...

09:50.699 --> 09:52.911
It's from my dad.

09:53.069 --> 09:54.926
How? I don't-I don't get it.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.514
I got it from my mom last
week when I was there visiting.

09:57.549 --> 10:01.921
After he died, my mom found out he
had a safety deposit box at some bank.

10:01.956 --> 10:03.829
Wait. Ty.

10:04.026 --> 10:06.185
So what was in it?

10:07.012 --> 10:07.983
She didn't wanna know.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.827
So she just wrapped it up and
gave it to me to deal with.

10:09.862 --> 10:13.353
Deal with what? I mean,
you haven't opened it?

10:13.951 --> 10:16.219
No. And I'm not going to.

10:16.254 --> 10:19.470
The only reason I took it from her was
so that I could get rid of it myself.

10:19.770 --> 10:22.003
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

10:25.370 --> 10:27.614
Okay, hang on a second.

10:28.081 --> 10:30.375
I'm not sure this is the
safest way to bring it down.

10:30.410 --> 10:31.669
Uh, Lou, this is really heavy.

10:31.751 --> 10:34.513
Maybe if we just change our positions
a little, we can get a better angle...

10:34.548 --> 10:36.128
Come on, I'm losing my grip here!

10:36.203 --> 10:37.996
No, no! Oh! Oh! Oh no!

10:38.031 --> 10:40.059
- Oh no, no, no!
- Are you okay?

10:40.094 --> 10:43.472
No, I am not okay! How could
you just let it fall like that!

10:43.507 --> 10:46.088
That is a very expensive bed frame!

10:46.222 --> 10:48.139
How could I let it fall?

10:48.259 --> 10:51.311
The whole reason it fell is 'cause you
were obsessing about not letting it fall!

10:51.346 --> 10:55.586
I was not obsessing, I was
trying to make a plan, okay?

10:55.621 --> 10:58.551
You can't just do these things haphazardly!

11:00.683 --> 11:02.851
You know, I think it's best for both of us

11:02.886 --> 11:05.348
if I just bring the rest
stuff down by myself.

11:05.383 --> 11:09.943
Fine! But if anything else breaks,
it's coming out of your paycheck.

11:18.169 --> 11:19.556
Dammit.

11:19.591 --> 11:22.092
- What now?
- Nothing!

11:22.459 --> 11:26.016
Kind of locked my keys
inside the car, okay?

11:26.506 --> 11:30.121
Well, I guess you didn't plan
that out too well, now did ya?

11:32.815 --> 11:35.321
Just call Jack, get him to
bring an extra set of keys.

11:35.417 --> 11:38.317
I can't. I locked my phone in there too.

11:38.458 --> 11:40.214
Can I borrow yours, please?

11:40.272 --> 11:42.013
No. I told you, my battery's dead.

11:42.048 --> 11:45.332
Seriously? I thought you were just
saying that to get off the call?

11:45.367 --> 11:48.399
Well, I'm not surprised someone has
pulled that stunt on you in the past.

11:48.434 --> 11:51.668
But it's legitimate.
My phone's dead. Sorry.

11:53.311 --> 11:56.202
Where is my mom?

11:56.490 --> 11:57.949
Maybe I should call her.

11:58.027 --> 11:59.611
Come on. We're finally making progress.

11:59.646 --> 12:01.641
You're actually not
that horrible in science.

12:01.676 --> 12:03.876
Told you.

12:03.952 --> 12:07.523
Okay, so explain
electromagnetic force to me.

12:07.649 --> 12:09.628
- What about it?
- How does it work?

12:09.663 --> 12:12.746
Oh, and don't forget
to make it entertaining.

12:14.817 --> 12:18.318
Okay. Can I use a real life example?

12:18.429 --> 12:20.371
Sure, whatever helps.

12:20.469 --> 12:25.488
Okay. Let's take two random
people like, I don't know,

12:25.523 --> 12:28.001
how about you and Olivia?

12:29.042 --> 12:30.669
Me and Olivia?

12:30.750 --> 12:33.378
Yeah. You can be a proton
and she's an electron...

12:33.413 --> 12:34.968
'cause she's so negative all the time...

12:35.003 --> 12:35.997
Where are you going with this?

12:36.032 --> 12:37.657
Just like protons and electrons,

12:37.692 --> 12:41.035
you and Olivia are complete
opposites in every way,

12:41.070 --> 12:44.341
yet you just can't seem to
keep your hands off each other.

12:44.497 --> 12:48.157
Uh, electrons and protons don't
have anything resembling hands...

12:48.192 --> 12:49.684
or any appendages for that matter...

12:49.781 --> 12:53.890
I saw you guys kissing,
okay? At Jade's party!

12:54.184 --> 12:57.403
- Wow, I can't believe this.
- Seriously? It was right out in the open.

12:57.438 --> 12:59.127
You didn't think I'd find out?

12:59.217 --> 13:02.989
- I didn't think you'd care.
- We kissed first.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.860
I thought you said that
didn't mean anything.

13:05.895 --> 13:09.563
Wow. For such a smart guy,
you can sure be dumb sometimes.

13:13.141 --> 13:14.641
I should go.

13:19.009 --> 13:20.867
How are you gonna get home?

13:47.197 --> 13:49.492
Just don't scratch the paint.

13:50.951 --> 13:52.494
This is gonna damage the door frame.

13:52.529 --> 13:53.463
I don't think this is a good idea.

13:53.498 --> 13:55.969
Ugh. Can you just give
me some space, please?

13:56.004 --> 13:57.336
I've done this before.
I know what I'm doing.

13:57.371 --> 13:59.250
Okay, sorry.

14:02.310 --> 14:06.322
Ow! Agh!

14:06.357 --> 14:07.748
What'd you do?

14:07.891 --> 14:09.824
Nothing. I'm... I'm fine.

14:09.907 --> 14:11.073
You know what? This is not going to work.

14:11.108 --> 14:14.090
I'm just gonna get a horse
and ride back to the ranch.

14:14.164 --> 14:17.451
- Yeah, your high horse.
- What was that?

14:18.050 --> 14:20.288
- Nothing.
- Stupid...

14:20.323 --> 14:22.359
Ahh! Ow!

14:22.433 --> 14:25.627
- What? Oh, are you okay?
- Oh, ow!

14:25.710 --> 14:27.842
- I twisted my ankle.
- Agh!

14:29.717 --> 14:31.528
Oh my God, I'm bleeding!

14:31.579 --> 14:34.404
Calm down. I'm the one who's bleeding.

14:35.086 --> 14:37.372
Stupid coat hanger.

15:07.396 --> 15:09.296
So you're opening it?

15:10.734 --> 15:13.931
No, I'm... not going to, no.

15:20.122 --> 15:24.059
I know things were complicated
with you and your dad.

15:24.305 --> 15:27.129
But you must be curious.

15:27.247 --> 15:31.133
Why not open it? There-there might
be something valuable in there.

15:31.354 --> 15:34.236
Exactly, Amy. And what if there is?

15:35.461 --> 15:38.245
Then I'm gonna have to
wonder where it came from.

15:39.277 --> 15:41.709
You remember my dad.

15:41.884 --> 15:45.052
So you're worried that there
might be something bad in there?

15:46.483 --> 15:49.697
I don't know.

15:51.039 --> 15:53.621
You know, there could be
something good in there, too.

15:53.977 --> 15:55.412
Or nothing at all.

15:55.447 --> 15:57.098
You're never gonna know
if you don't open it.

15:57.133 --> 15:57.742
Okay.

16:02.331 --> 16:06.120
Okay. I'm sorry. It's none of my business.

16:06.338 --> 16:08.271
Thank you.

16:28.623 --> 16:30.157
I couldn't get a hold of my mom.

16:30.192 --> 16:32.444
And it's too far to walk
all the way home, so...

16:32.479 --> 16:34.294
Maybe Jack could give you a ride.

16:34.460 --> 16:37.330
No. I think we have
some unfinished business.

16:37.654 --> 16:39.399
Yeah, we do.

16:39.464 --> 16:42.569
I guess we didn't cover
everything on the test.

16:43.852 --> 16:46.305
Yeah. That's what I meant too.

16:46.456 --> 16:49.036
Come on, let's get this over with.

16:52.581 --> 16:55.455
It's fine. You know, it's
probably just sprained.

16:55.490 --> 16:58.985
Yeah, but you should
still get some ice on it.

16:59.113 --> 17:01.070
You know what? I'll... I'll
tack up one of the trail horses

17:01.105 --> 17:02.513
and I'll take you back to the ranch.

17:02.548 --> 17:05.656
No. There's no way you can get the
rest of that stuff down by yourself,

17:05.691 --> 17:08.394
especially with your hand like that.

17:08.517 --> 17:11.146
I'm fine. It's just a...
it's just a flesh wound.

17:11.268 --> 17:12.827
Whatever, Mr. Tough Guy.

17:12.862 --> 17:14.233
Look, you're the one that can barely walk

17:14.289 --> 17:16.101
and you're pretending like it's nothing.

17:16.824 --> 17:18.790
It's a bad family trait.

17:19.320 --> 17:21.855
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah, I get it from my dad.

17:21.890 --> 17:24.009
He has this old shoulder injury.

17:24.115 --> 17:26.277
Whenever it pops out... Ow!...

17:26.424 --> 17:28.548
he thinks he can slam it
back into place by himself.

17:28.583 --> 17:31.887
Kinda sounds like the good Dr. Cutty.

17:31.922 --> 17:33.518
That's what everybody calls my dad.

17:33.607 --> 17:35.654
- Your dad's a doctor?
- God, no.

17:35.689 --> 17:37.278
It's just a nickname.

17:37.313 --> 17:39.453
He's so damn cheap he
does his own dental work.

17:39.488 --> 17:40.195
What?!

17:40.230 --> 17:43.346
This one time, I saw him pull out
a bad molar with a pair of pliers.

17:43.381 --> 17:44.875
- Yikes!
- Yeah.

17:44.910 --> 17:46.522
And he had this chipped tooth once.

17:46.557 --> 17:48.560
He ground it down with a steel file.

17:48.595 --> 17:49.786
Okay, that's enough.

17:49.821 --> 17:52.968
Ow, ow, ow...

17:54.112 --> 17:55.238
You know, I actually...

17:55.274 --> 17:57.259
I think that we just found
some common ground here.

17:57.294 --> 17:59.283
Why? Because we're the walking wounded?

17:59.318 --> 18:01.812
No. Because we got crazy dads.

18:01.972 --> 18:04.756
Yeah.

18:05.594 --> 18:08.689
Okay. Yeah, let's um...

18:08.766 --> 18:10.698
let's get the rest of that
stuff down off the roof.

18:10.733 --> 18:14.164
Yeah.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.434
G.G., can you help me
draw a picture of my pony?

18:21.469 --> 18:24.233
Um, yeah, maybe later.

18:24.299 --> 18:26.745
But G.G.!

18:27.946 --> 18:30.609
Now look who's leaving
their phone lying around.

18:30.644 --> 18:33.136
Oh, I was wondering where that was.

18:35.227 --> 18:37.713
Lisa, can you help me
draw a picture of my pony?

18:37.748 --> 18:39.082
Yes, of course.

18:39.175 --> 18:41.517
- You missed a call...
- Oh.

18:41.552 --> 18:43.852
It's from your doctor. Is everything okay?

18:43.955 --> 18:47.121
Yes. I uh... yeah. I
had an annual last week.

18:47.156 --> 18:49.791
It must be just a follow-up call.

18:49.883 --> 18:52.366
Can we-can we draw the picture now?

18:52.401 --> 18:54.165
Oh, yes, little Miss Persistent.

18:54.254 --> 18:56.621
Just give me one minute.

19:07.453 --> 19:11.412
Hi. I'm wondering if I
could speak to Dr. Anderson?

19:11.557 --> 19:15.480
He just called... Oh, okay. Okay.

19:15.515 --> 19:20.216
Um, yeah, could you ask him
to please call Lisa Stillman

19:20.251 --> 19:22.357
when he's available.

19:22.454 --> 19:26.685
Thank-you. Okay. Bye.

19:29.833 --> 19:32.133
What's the next question?

19:34.121 --> 19:38.539
Actually, can we talk about... you know.

19:38.818 --> 19:40.340
Fine.

19:40.464 --> 19:42.183
I've been thinking about what you said...

19:42.218 --> 19:44.444
about Olivia and all that stuff.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.314
But after you and I kissed or whatever

19:47.426 --> 19:50.140
you really brushed me
off like it was nothing.

19:50.175 --> 19:52.932
So you were trying to get
back at me with Olivia?

19:53.068 --> 19:55.756
- No. It wasn't like that.
- Yeah, right.

19:55.791 --> 19:59.173
You know, she was probably just
using you to get back at me too.

19:59.595 --> 20:01.461
Actually, I don't think so.

20:01.548 --> 20:05.265
We've kind of been hanging out since then.

20:05.346 --> 20:07.512
We're going to a movie tonight.

20:10.828 --> 20:13.595
Can we just get back to studying, please?

20:22.556 --> 20:23.923
Hello?

20:24.562 --> 20:26.195
Yes, this is she.

20:27.988 --> 20:32.191
Oh, um... no. 'scuse me,
no, I'm not interested.

20:32.284 --> 20:36.050
Okay. And please, could you
take me off your call list?

20:36.085 --> 20:38.063
Thank you very much.

20:40.776 --> 20:44.165
Okay, so what's really going on here?

20:44.200 --> 20:47.991
Telemarketers. It's just
just-they're annoying, silly.

20:50.878 --> 20:52.244
What?

20:54.080 --> 20:59.651
The doctor, uh... we,
we just ran a few tests.

20:59.817 --> 21:00.763
What kind of tests?

21:00.798 --> 21:03.855
No, no big deal. Just...
uh... he's hyper-cautious

21:03.890 --> 21:06.791
and he saw something on a
scan, and because of my history,

21:06.827 --> 21:09.861
he just uh... you know,
playing it on the safe side.

21:11.764 --> 21:15.199
Really. Honestly. It's no big deal.

21:15.290 --> 21:17.066
'Kay, I'm gonna go ask Katie
which of these little critters

21:17.101 --> 21:19.567
she wants me to draw next.

21:24.513 --> 21:27.235
You actually think there's a
chance of her putting that thing on?

21:27.270 --> 21:29.544
I don't know. But if
she can get used to this,

21:29.579 --> 21:32.021
it's a step towards putting
on the inhalation mask.

21:32.056 --> 21:33.663
Okay, well, good luck.

21:33.698 --> 21:35.552
Look, it's just a grazing muzzle.

21:35.603 --> 21:37.302
You're okay.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.591
You gotta be kidding me.

21:40.726 --> 21:44.088
- Wow.
- Okay, so why was that so easy?

21:44.123 --> 21:46.370
I don't know. She obviously
doesn't have a problem

21:46.405 --> 21:48.999
with something being on her face, but...

21:49.455 --> 21:52.970
Yeah. Except for the mask
that she needs to be wearing.

21:53.114 --> 21:54.948
Do you think it's the way
it looks that scares her?

21:54.983 --> 21:57.642
Or maybe it's the hard plastic?

21:57.677 --> 22:00.444
I actually think it
might be something else.

22:01.813 --> 22:04.149
Okay, I'm gonna go wait for my mom outside.

22:04.184 --> 22:04.900
See you later?

22:04.935 --> 22:07.678
Bye.

22:07.898 --> 22:10.734
Don't... don't go.

22:11.032 --> 22:15.261
I mean... don't go to
that movie with Olivia.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.594
I don't like the fact that
you guys are hanging out

22:17.629 --> 22:20.737
'cause I wouldn't mind
hanging out with you and...

22:20.826 --> 22:23.542
maybe we could go to a movie or something?

22:24.881 --> 22:28.570
Are you saying you want to
be like more than friends?

22:28.864 --> 22:30.472
Maybe.

22:30.507 --> 22:33.839
You realize this could be
like opening Pandora's box.

22:35.614 --> 22:37.146
Pandora's box is a Greek myth.

22:37.181 --> 22:39.705
It was said to contain
all the evils of the world,

22:39.740 --> 22:42.647
and that opening it could
have far-reaching consequences.

22:42.682 --> 22:44.118
I know what it means.

22:44.263 --> 22:46.764
So? Do you wanna hang out or not?

23:00.398 --> 23:02.463
Sorry, Mr. Bartlett, but honestly,
it's not the way it looked.

23:02.498 --> 23:05.288
- I know what I saw.
- But nothing even happened!

23:05.323 --> 23:07.510
That's because I was here.

23:07.569 --> 23:10.771
And you, you're supposed
to be her tutor, aren't you?

23:10.838 --> 23:12.905
I think you oughta leave.

23:14.301 --> 23:15.783
Well, his mom's not here yet.

23:15.818 --> 23:18.996
That's fine. I'll drive him home myself.

23:19.093 --> 23:21.332
That's okay. I can walk.

23:25.683 --> 23:27.983
Thanks, Jack. That was so embarrassing...

23:28.104 --> 23:29.871
and all over nothing!

23:35.767 --> 23:38.033
Okay, so I just got off
the phone with the lawyer.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.012
Yeah, oh yeah...

23:39.047 --> 23:40.516
He said he can meet us this afternoon,

23:40.590 --> 23:43.587
so do you think Ty and Amy
would watch Katie while we go?

23:43.622 --> 23:45.671
Uh... yeah, I can ask 'em.

23:45.706 --> 23:47.275
Okay, please do that. Thank you.

23:49.077 --> 23:50.543
That's the last of it off the roof.

23:50.578 --> 23:51.945
How's it looking inside?

23:51.980 --> 23:53.739
Same as it did, just have to...

23:53.774 --> 23:57.308
put that back on the bedside
table and... we're done.

23:57.343 --> 23:58.863
Great. I'm gonna go tack you up a horse

23:58.898 --> 24:00.914
and Maverick and I will ride
back with you, all right?

24:00.949 --> 24:03.904
Maverick? The horse that
Amy was working with?

24:03.939 --> 24:05.278
That's your horse?

24:05.313 --> 24:07.481
Yeah. She, uh, she really
straightened him out.

24:07.516 --> 24:08.928
Yeah, well, I'm not surprised.

24:08.963 --> 24:10.897
She's amazing at what she does.

24:10.932 --> 24:13.669
Hah. Look at you, all
proud of your kid sister.

24:15.004 --> 24:16.137
You have siblings?

24:16.172 --> 24:19.493
Uh, only child. Well, technically.

24:19.528 --> 24:21.206
What does that mean?

24:21.307 --> 24:23.276
My cousin, Zack,

24:23.350 --> 24:25.931
we were born like a month
apart from each other.

24:25.989 --> 24:27.387
My parents have all these pictures of us

24:27.422 --> 24:30.805
splashing around in this
cheap little Mr. Turtle pool.

24:30.840 --> 24:33.396
I totally remember those.

24:33.431 --> 24:35.087
Yeah, I-I rode the bus with that guy

24:35.122 --> 24:38.188
like from kindergarten to high school.

24:38.223 --> 24:40.693
We even joined the military together.

24:40.728 --> 24:44.588
So... guess he's more
like a brother really.

24:44.623 --> 24:48.090
That's cool. Are you guys still close?

24:50.557 --> 24:52.590
I'm gonna go tack up your horse, okay?

24:54.640 --> 24:56.140
Okay.

25:01.154 --> 25:03.309
So what do you got going here?

25:03.405 --> 25:07.016
Just reading through Mom's journals
to find a recipe for aroma therapy.

25:07.081 --> 25:08.107
We have this client horse in

25:08.142 --> 25:10.787
and I don't think she likes
the smell of her medication.

25:10.858 --> 25:12.148
I wonder if I could ask a favour?

25:12.183 --> 25:13.570
Lisa and I need to go into town,

25:13.605 --> 25:14.950
can you guys watch Katie?

25:14.985 --> 25:17.110
Yeah, of course. She can
hang out with us in the barn.

25:17.145 --> 25:18.495
What's in town?

25:19.193 --> 25:20.863
Oh, it's no big deal.

25:20.991 --> 25:22.342
What's going on?

25:22.412 --> 25:24.700
Oh, I don't... really need to get into it.

25:24.803 --> 25:27.715
Do you want me to drop
this off at the Post Office?

25:27.750 --> 25:31.141
No, this is Ty's. His Mom gave it to him.

25:31.572 --> 25:34.170
It's the contents from his
dad's safety deposit box

25:34.205 --> 25:36.070
that no one even knew he had.

25:36.159 --> 25:39.269
- What's in it?
- Who knows? Ty won't open it.

25:39.304 --> 25:41.417
He doesn't even wanna talk about it.

25:41.505 --> 25:42.951
You know how he gets with his dad.

25:42.986 --> 25:44.246
It always rattles him.

25:44.281 --> 25:48.450
Yeah. I was there when
Ty spread Brad's ashes,

25:48.485 --> 25:50.585
and he was looking for answers then, too.

25:50.620 --> 25:52.583
I can't help but wonder
if some of those answers

25:52.618 --> 25:54.470
could've been found in
that safety deposit box?

25:54.505 --> 25:57.199
Well, you never know. There
could be something in there

25:57.288 --> 26:00.848
that sheds a little light on who Brad was.

26:00.883 --> 26:04.292
And I can see why that scares Ty, but...

26:04.422 --> 26:07.022
he shouldn't be afraid of the truth though.

26:07.632 --> 26:08.843
You know what? Never mind.

26:08.879 --> 26:10.782
Don't worry about looking after Katie.

26:10.843 --> 26:12.710
I'm not going anywhere.

26:22.274 --> 26:24.207
We're not going to see your lawyer.

26:24.336 --> 26:25.288
Not today.

26:25.323 --> 26:29.863
Why? No, I mean, if Ty and Amy can't take
care of Katie then Georgie will do it.

26:29.899 --> 26:31.927
I know what you're doing.

26:32.041 --> 26:33.551
You're using it as a distraction,

26:33.586 --> 26:35.071
and that's no way to deal with this.

26:35.106 --> 26:37.871
No, no. We need to deal with my estate...

26:37.961 --> 26:40.809
And we will, I promise.

26:40.950 --> 26:43.083
But today's not the day.

26:45.053 --> 26:50.295
I'm a little bit worried.

26:52.193 --> 26:53.860
I'm scared...

26:55.455 --> 26:57.009
That's why I just wanna just do something.

26:57.044 --> 26:58.088
You don't need to do anything.

26:58.123 --> 27:02.262
Yes, I do. I just wanna do
something or I might just fall apart.

27:02.575 --> 27:03.967
What's wrong with that?

27:11.307 --> 27:15.112
Everything's gonna be okay.

27:20.869 --> 27:22.314
Any reason you wanna do this out here?

27:22.349 --> 27:25.301
I think the open air might
help her feel less confined.

27:25.336 --> 27:27.131
I've mixed up two different recipes.

27:27.166 --> 27:28.954
Peppermint and lavender.

27:28.989 --> 27:30.247
Okay.

27:30.282 --> 27:33.616
All right... Let's see
which one she prefers.

27:37.222 --> 27:39.644
Hey, girl, what's this?

27:39.706 --> 27:42.474
Hey... You like that?

27:42.509 --> 27:44.638
Nope. Not peppermint.

27:44.673 --> 27:46.907
Here's the lavender one.

27:46.942 --> 27:50.538
Here... Penelope, look. What's this?

27:51.994 --> 27:54.936
All right! It looks like
Penelope's a lavender girl.

27:55.072 --> 27:57.294
Okay.

27:57.661 --> 27:59.783
Well, I guess Marion's journal
came to the rescue again.

27:59.818 --> 28:03.170
Yeah. These have helped
me a lot over the years.

28:03.205 --> 28:05.490
Not just with horses.

28:05.525 --> 28:07.414
Come here. Look at all this.

28:07.449 --> 28:10.912
- See all these scribbles and notes here?
- Oh yeah.

28:10.947 --> 28:13.641
These are notes and reminders to herself.

28:13.676 --> 28:16.440
Every time I read them, it's like
I can hear her voice in my head.

28:20.895 --> 28:23.863
I know what you're trying to do, Amy.

28:24.051 --> 28:27.358
But I don't wanna hear my dad's voice.

28:27.468 --> 28:30.503
You had a real mom, Amy,
she was there for you.

28:31.029 --> 28:33.248
My dad was never around,

28:33.558 --> 28:37.326
And there's nothing in a safety deposit
box that ever is gonna change that.

28:37.752 --> 28:39.538
I know.

28:40.079 --> 28:42.794
But I can't help but wonder what's worse?

28:42.829 --> 28:46.898
The chance that you might find
something that you don't like,

28:46.979 --> 28:50.413
or that you might never know
what's actually in that box?

28:54.272 --> 28:56.806
- Come on, let's give this a shot.
- Okay.

29:02.294 --> 29:05.901
All right... I think you'll
like the smell of this

29:05.963 --> 29:08.381
much better than that stinky medication.

29:08.416 --> 29:10.694
Easy...

29:10.729 --> 29:13.564
What's that smell? Smell that?

29:15.091 --> 29:17.197
I know...

29:17.232 --> 29:19.370
- Yes!
- There you go! Look, Ty!

29:19.405 --> 29:23.410
- Yes!
- Oh, good girl, Penelope.

29:23.490 --> 29:26.103
See? That's not so bad.

29:29.953 --> 29:33.598
Okay, easy now. Easy.

29:33.633 --> 29:38.251
- Good girl.
- Thank you.

29:38.286 --> 29:39.643
Yeah...

29:43.933 --> 29:46.111
I didn't mean to pry about your cousin.

29:46.170 --> 29:48.001
Hey, I brought him up.

29:48.036 --> 29:51.318
Sometimes it helps to talk about
Zack and sometimes it doesn't.

29:51.353 --> 29:54.220
Whatever happened between you
two is none of my business.

29:54.290 --> 29:55.989
He's gone.

29:57.527 --> 29:59.887
He didn't make it back from his last tour.

30:02.127 --> 30:06.266
I... I shouldn't have given him the
idea to sign up in the first place.

30:06.410 --> 30:10.711
Hey. I'm really sorry.

30:15.082 --> 30:17.816
Come on, now, I'll give you a leg up.

30:21.397 --> 30:24.558
- Agh!
- Ow! Ooh! Ow!

30:24.593 --> 30:25.988
Oh, oh, ahh!

30:26.172 --> 30:28.062
Oh, oh, ahh!

30:28.168 --> 30:31.661
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

30:31.729 --> 30:32.721
What is wrong with us?

30:32.756 --> 30:35.253
I don't know.

30:35.288 --> 30:38.038
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

30:43.043 --> 30:46.996
W-wait! W-What're
you doing?

30:47.068 --> 30:48.968
What am I doing?

30:49.057 --> 30:50.724
I-I gotta get outta here.

30:50.759 --> 30:53.152
Uh...

30:53.187 --> 30:54.565
I'm sorry, wait. I'll just...

30:54.600 --> 30:55.675
Just hold on a second. I'll
get Maverick, we'll ride...

30:55.710 --> 30:57.810
No, I just... I-I gotta go.

30:57.845 --> 30:59.468
You know...

30:59.503 --> 31:02.188
I-I just... have to go.

31:02.555 --> 31:05.156
Come on, let's go.

31:23.219 --> 31:25.586
Come on...

31:28.023 --> 31:30.052
All right, let's have
a listen to her lungs.

31:40.100 --> 31:42.316
Well, her airways have
definitely opened up a little.

31:42.351 --> 31:44.270
So the steroids are working?

31:44.367 --> 31:46.505
Yeah, sure seems like it.

31:46.587 --> 31:49.306
'Kay, well, should we try
another round with the mask?

31:50.278 --> 31:54.306
Uh... I think once is enough for today.

31:54.341 --> 31:56.880
Let's give her a break
and try again tomorrow.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.547
I'll take her into the barn.

32:10.377 --> 32:12.161
It's my doctor...

32:13.066 --> 32:15.502
Dr. Anderson? Hi.

32:16.259 --> 32:19.983
I know. I know we have been playing
a little phone tag today, right?

32:20.864 --> 32:23.064
Yeah, so...

32:25.806 --> 32:27.272
Really?!

32:28.098 --> 32:29.498
Well...

32:29.816 --> 32:32.016
Yes, I'm relieved.

32:33.771 --> 32:35.986
Yes, that's very good news.

32:36.105 --> 32:38.555
Thank you. Yes.

32:38.672 --> 32:41.125
Thank you for calling
back. I really appreciate...

32:41.252 --> 32:43.723
Okay. Okay. Bye.

32:52.404 --> 32:55.572
See? Everything's gonna be all right.

32:56.100 --> 32:58.247
But I already told you that.

32:58.282 --> 32:59.976
Yes, well, you know everything!

33:17.857 --> 33:21.952
Uh-huh. You do need a ride, don't you?

33:21.987 --> 33:23.581
No. My mom picked me up,

33:23.616 --> 33:26.204
but I asked her if she could bring me back.

33:26.627 --> 33:28.541
Look, I really need you to hear me out.

33:28.576 --> 33:29.672
Okay.

33:29.854 --> 33:31.340
What's going on?

33:31.376 --> 33:34.860
I came back to say I'm sorry.

33:34.915 --> 33:37.935
Well, I appreciate that,
but it's not necessary.

33:37.970 --> 33:41.113
In fact, I think I may
have overreacted a little.

33:41.148 --> 33:44.186
- No kidding.
- Be that as it may,

33:44.400 --> 33:48.424
we might have to re-think this
whole tutoring arrangement.

33:49.972 --> 33:52.873
C'mon, I'll walk you to your mom's car.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.869
Hey, don't forget that...

33:54.951 --> 33:59.167
I have a pretty good view of the
whole yard right from that door.

34:13.822 --> 34:15.859
Can't he see my mom's right there?

34:15.893 --> 34:17.893
Just ignore him.

34:19.094 --> 34:21.322
This is weird. I should go.

34:21.404 --> 34:23.295
To that movie with Olivia?

34:23.527 --> 34:26.188
No. I cancelled that.

34:26.378 --> 34:29.530
I didn't think it was appropriate
under the circumstances.

34:29.565 --> 34:32.032
What circumstances?

34:32.154 --> 34:33.571
I don't know, but...

34:33.606 --> 34:38.127
you're the one I wanna go to movies
with and stuff like that, so...

34:38.210 --> 34:41.177
Well, maybe we can hang
sometime this weekend?

34:49.484 --> 34:51.636
- Hey!
- Hey.

34:57.291 --> 34:59.867
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

34:59.902 --> 35:01.094
But you're... you're limping.

35:01.129 --> 35:04.224
- No, no, it's uh... it's nothing.
- Here, here.

35:04.366 --> 35:07.591
Thank you. It's a long story.

35:08.703 --> 35:11.070
I'm sorry I took so long.

35:11.253 --> 35:13.253
Did it go okay with Adam?

35:14.473 --> 35:18.440
Uh... yeah. Um, actually pretty great.

35:18.475 --> 35:19.566
Great?

35:19.632 --> 35:24.269
Yeah. But I think I might
have opened Pandora's box.

35:29.557 --> 35:32.143
I've been thinking about what
you said... about the box.

35:35.629 --> 35:37.755
Well, the truth is... when
I first found out about it,

35:37.829 --> 35:39.433
I was actually... I was excited.

35:39.468 --> 35:40.465
I mean, maybe there's something in there

35:40.500 --> 35:43.167
that would make me feel
better about my dad.

35:43.999 --> 35:47.705
But it was the same kind of feeling I'd
get every time he'd come back into my life

35:47.762 --> 35:49.706
and... you know how that turned out.

35:49.741 --> 35:51.799
Yeah. No, I... I get it.

35:51.834 --> 35:53.678
You don't want him to hurt
you anymore and that's fine.

35:53.752 --> 35:56.453
We can just go throw it out together.

35:57.407 --> 36:00.730
No, Amy, I've changed my mind.

36:00.765 --> 36:02.297
I wanna open it.

36:03.219 --> 36:05.409
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I am.

36:05.508 --> 36:08.468
I mean, maybe I just
wanna punish myself more,

36:08.503 --> 36:11.386
or... maybe it's the fact that I know

36:11.421 --> 36:14.441
that no matter what's in that box,

36:14.476 --> 36:17.033
nothing can ruin how good we have it.

36:17.098 --> 36:19.312
So let's just open the damn thing.

36:19.347 --> 36:21.438
Okay.

36:34.884 --> 36:36.551
Huh.

36:36.586 --> 36:40.054
What? It's just his birth certificate.

36:40.226 --> 36:43.493
He lied to me about his age.

36:44.798 --> 36:46.686
Drivers license.

36:50.391 --> 36:52.657
My parents' divorce papers.

36:55.506 --> 36:57.309
I think this is an old race track ticket.

36:57.383 --> 36:59.508
Why would he have kept that?

36:59.813 --> 37:03.145
Who knows? Maybe it's the one
time he actually picked a winner.

37:03.249 --> 37:05.115
We should try and cash it.

37:06.980 --> 37:08.943
_

37:11.221 --> 37:12.955
Is that you?

37:14.303 --> 37:15.803
Yeah, that's me.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.293
This is the day I learned
to ride a dirt bike.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.984
My dad taught me. Well, not very well.

37:21.019 --> 37:22.859
I mean, I crashed three
or four times, but...

37:25.782 --> 37:27.427
I can't believe he kept this.

37:27.798 --> 37:30.565
That day must have meant something to him.

37:36.595 --> 37:40.236
Okay... It's addressed to my Mom.

37:41.096 --> 37:42.929
Open it.

38:00.549 --> 38:03.375
What?

38:05.140 --> 38:07.640
This is my mom's engagement ring.

38:07.675 --> 38:09.342
Why would he have that?

38:10.674 --> 38:12.274
Because he stole it.

38:17.855 --> 38:20.285
- He stole it?
- Yeah.

38:21.165 --> 38:24.192
He pawned it off to pay
off some gambling debt.

38:27.050 --> 38:29.872
Yeah, it was the final
straw in their marriage.

38:38.033 --> 38:41.466
"Hey, Lil, I thought you should have this.

38:41.575 --> 38:45.661
So I saved up a little dough and...

38:45.717 --> 38:48.050
and bought it back for you.

38:49.010 --> 38:51.338
I guess every dog has his day.

38:52.955 --> 38:56.485
Brad."

38:56.707 --> 38:58.908
She never got that, did she?

39:02.300 --> 39:08.214
No, she-she never really had
a... fixed address, you know?

39:10.993 --> 39:13.219
Are you gonna give her the ring?

39:15.121 --> 39:20.177
Yeah. I will.

39:20.212 --> 39:22.145
On my next visit.

39:23.100 --> 39:27.032
But first I'm going to
send her this letter.

39:27.882 --> 39:30.616
She deserves to know
Brad wasn't all that bad.

39:36.241 --> 39:37.870
Thank you for being there for me today.

39:37.905 --> 39:39.238
I'm sorry I was so crazy.

39:39.273 --> 39:42.107
Well, I'll give you a pass this time.

39:42.345 --> 39:43.583
I don't know what I'd do without you.

39:43.618 --> 39:44.525
You know, me neither...

39:44.560 --> 39:48.687
Especially since you're saddling me
with an entire horse breeding operation.

39:48.768 --> 39:51.733
Hey! We are going and doing
that this week, by the way.

39:51.768 --> 39:55.123
- Yeah, yeah...
- Are you charging your phone?

39:56.921 --> 39:58.788
Lou?

39:59.119 --> 40:03.388
Let's just say that it's been
a long day and leave it at that.

40:04.923 --> 40:06.717
What happened to your mother?

40:06.752 --> 40:09.508
She didn't wanna talk about it.

40:09.543 --> 40:13.324
Oh. I don't suppose you
feel like talking either...

40:13.359 --> 40:16.318
you know, about what's
going on with you and Adam.

40:16.450 --> 40:19.317
- Nothing happened, remember?
- Mm-hmm?

40:20.937 --> 40:23.522
You know, I actually like that kid...

40:23.614 --> 40:26.191
as far as teenage boys go,

40:26.226 --> 40:30.210
so try not to break his heart.

40:31.983 --> 40:34.525
Whatever.

40:51.104 --> 40:52.771
Uh, hey.

40:52.806 --> 40:54.305
Hey.

40:55.231 --> 40:57.521
Uh, how's-how's it feeling?

40:57.685 --> 41:00.713
Seriously? You're gonna
ask me about my ankle?

41:00.775 --> 41:02.451
That's what you have
to say to me right now?

41:02.486 --> 41:06.003
Look, I'm sorry about the whole...

41:06.270 --> 41:08.245
I guess I just got caught up in the moment.

41:08.281 --> 41:10.248
Yeah. You did.

41:11.823 --> 41:13.302
What about you?

41:13.357 --> 41:15.971
It... it was a mistake.

41:16.070 --> 41:17.944
Right.

41:18.996 --> 41:21.427
Look, this job, it means
a lot to me. Please...

41:21.498 --> 41:23.356
You're not gonna get fired, okay?

41:23.401 --> 41:25.493
Jack likes having you around too much.

41:25.613 --> 41:29.214
Really. You're keeping me
around because Jack likes me?

41:29.249 --> 41:31.283
Yeah... that's right.

41:31.333 --> 41:34.395
But I'm still your boss when it
comes to the Dude Ranch, so...

41:34.465 --> 41:38.010
that can't happen again. It was wrong.

41:38.045 --> 41:41.113
- Scandalous.
- Hey, don't make light of this.

41:41.247 --> 41:42.937
We'll just pretend it never happened.

41:43.031 --> 41:44.247
That's right.

41:44.282 --> 41:46.695
Because I don't want things to get weird.

41:53.854 --> 41:56.331
Oh, what the hell...
Things are weird already.

42:11.194 --> 42:15.492
- What?
- It's just...

42:15.574 --> 42:17.506
there's this whole series of jokes

42:17.541 --> 42:19.091
about the ranch hand and
the farmer's daughter that...

42:19.126 --> 42:20.855
Oh my God.

42:46.204 --> 42:48.339
So maybe after we go to the post office,

42:48.374 --> 42:51.555
we could go shopping for
my anniversary present?

42:51.804 --> 42:53.884
How do you know I haven't
already got you something?

42:53.919 --> 42:55.286
What did you get me?

42:55.373 --> 42:57.768
I can't tell you.

42:57.812 --> 42:59.678
You're gonna have to wait and see.

42:59.868 --> 43:02.035
And no snooping around this time.

43:07.677 --> 43:09.577
Okay.

43:35.215 --> 43:36.340
On the next <i>Heartland.</i>

43:36.398 --> 43:40.132
I can't guarantee your safety, or
the safety of those sweet little kids.

43:40.167 --> 43:41.388
Betrayal

43:41.423 --> 43:42.172
and revenge.

43:42.207 --> 43:43.601
The horses. We have to grab them!

43:43.636 --> 43:45.971
Danger strikes close to home.

43:46.006 --> 43:49.447
<i>Heartland,</i> next
Sunday at 7:00 on <i>CBC.</i>
