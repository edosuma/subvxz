00:01.479 --> 00:03.003
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Welcome back, friends.

00:03.046 --> 00:05.657
You'll recall our Jane
was dealing with quite a doozy

00:05.701 --> 00:08.051
because Michael came back
from the freaking dead,

00:08.095 --> 00:10.053
only he was
just a little different.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.054
Actually,

00:11.098 --> 00:13.100
I go by Jason now, ma'am.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.275
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You see, it turns out Rose,

00:14.318 --> 00:16.016
aka Sin Rostro,

00:16.059 --> 00:17.539
kidnapped Michael
and gave him amnesia.

00:17.582 --> 00:18.975
You don't remember me?

00:19.019 --> 00:20.585
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And her former lover Luisa

00:20.629 --> 00:22.283
was determined
to find out why she did it.

00:22.326 --> 00:24.807
I know, straight out
of a telenovela, right?

00:24.850 --> 00:26.374
And speaking of telenovelas,

00:26.417 --> 00:28.463
Jane's father Rogelio
was excited

00:28.506 --> 00:31.031
to launch the American version
ofThe Passions of Santos,

00:31.074 --> 00:33.250
and his costar--
the fabulous River Fields,

00:33.294 --> 00:36.166
who he had
a rocky relationship with.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.908
Also navigating
tricky relationships-- Alba.

00:38.951 --> 00:41.606
See, she had a quickie wedding
to her ex-boyfriend Jorge

00:41.650 --> 00:44.000
to help him get a green card.
The only problem--

00:44.044 --> 00:46.829
her fake marriage had Alba
catching real feelings.

00:46.872 --> 00:49.092
And speaking of feelings, our
Jane vowed to help Michael...

00:49.136 --> 00:50.920
My bad.

00:50.963 --> 00:53.357
...Jason get his memories back, but she refused

00:53.401 --> 00:57.100
to let it interfere with
her relationship with Rafael.

00:57.144 --> 00:59.755
I want to move in with you
now. I love you, Rafael.

00:59.798 --> 01:02.714
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which, my friends,
is where we left off.

01:04.325 --> 01:06.805
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva

01:06.849 --> 01:10.026
was two months, 12 days
and 18 hours old,

01:10.070 --> 01:12.115
she received
her first sacrament

01:12.159 --> 01:13.943
in the Catholic Church.

01:13.986 --> 01:17.512
And as she moved
through her religious life,

01:17.555 --> 01:20.036
these were her touchstones,

01:20.080 --> 01:23.126
her holy rites of passage.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.737
In the name of the Father...

01:25.781 --> 01:27.087
And of the Son

01:27.130 --> 01:29.698
and of the Holy Spirit.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.091
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Some were solemn,

01:31.134 --> 01:33.571
some were joyous.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.096
Amen.

01:36.139 --> 01:38.228
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But they were, above all,

01:38.272 --> 01:39.751
eternal.

01:39.795 --> 01:42.319
Or until death
do us part.

01:42.363 --> 01:44.974
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Or so Jane thought.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.979
It wasn't the lawyer.
It was a telemarketer.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.158
I guess she doesn't have a ton
of experience

01:55.202 --> 01:56.681
with husbands
who come back from the dead.

01:59.728 --> 02:03.166
I just want an answer.
I mean, yes or no?
No.

02:08.215 --> 02:10.391
But I love that lamp.
I picked it out

02:10.434 --> 02:12.001
and I forced you to buy it.

02:16.832 --> 02:17.833
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That's right,

02:17.876 --> 02:19.008
while Jane was moving out,

02:19.051 --> 02:20.009
Jorge was moving in.

02:20.052 --> 02:21.706
Temporarily, of course.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.061
Like I said. And...

02:50.866 --> 02:53.042
Abuela, you okay?

02:56.480 --> 02:58.178
But it could still be confusing.

03:03.966 --> 03:06.098
You know I finally had
my mind off of that, right?

03:06.142 --> 03:07.796
MATEO:
Mom!

03:07.839 --> 03:10.277
I can't find the blue pieces
from my building set!

03:10.320 --> 03:13.105
Oh. It's the lawyer.

03:15.020 --> 03:19.199
Hello? Hi. Yes.
Uh, so, am I married or not?

03:28.077 --> 03:29.470
RAFAEL:
Still no answer?

03:29.513 --> 03:30.993
No, it's crazy.

03:31.036 --> 03:32.821
She's consulting
colleagues,

03:32.864 --> 03:35.127
a conflicting legal
precedent, blah, blah, blah.

03:35.171 --> 03:36.390
Your grandma let
you have this?

03:36.433 --> 03:38.696
The point is, I might not know

03:38.740 --> 03:40.785
if I'm married or not
for a week.

03:40.829 --> 03:42.352
I deserve that lamp.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.833
And for you...

03:44.876 --> 03:46.617
Ooh. A color-coded calendar.

03:46.661 --> 03:48.228
What is the occasion?

03:48.271 --> 03:50.230
It's how I'm gonna help
Jason get his memories back

03:50.273 --> 03:51.753
without letting it
interfere in our life.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.407
I am liking this calendar.

03:53.450 --> 03:56.148
Right? Mateo's blue. We have
to keep them apart, obviously.

03:56.192 --> 03:58.020
Agreed. What is, uh, CCD?

03:58.063 --> 04:00.631
Catholic classes until
his first Communion.

04:00.675 --> 04:02.590
We talked about this.
You said yes.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.287
I just don't want Mateo thinking

04:04.331 --> 04:06.289
every time he does something
wrong, he's going to hell.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.205
That is not what the
Church teaches... at first.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.294
Look, my husband just
came back from the dead.

04:11.338 --> 04:14.036
Can you just agree to what
you already agreed to?

04:14.079 --> 04:15.298
Is this what Catholic guilt
feels like?

04:15.342 --> 04:17.126
Yeah. Is it working?Yes.

04:17.169 --> 04:20.390
Thank you. By the way,
note the calendar.

04:20.434 --> 04:22.262
You don't leave for
work for half an hour,

04:22.305 --> 04:24.307
and Mateo's at school.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.744
Oh. So we have a window?

04:26.788 --> 04:28.616
Oh, we have a window.

04:30.139 --> 04:31.140
Oh.

04:32.924 --> 04:34.274
Hey.

04:39.975 --> 04:42.151
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Unfortunately, they also had

04:42.194 --> 04:44.284
a door, which had been
accidentally left open.

04:44.327 --> 04:45.937
Sorry I'm early.

04:45.981 --> 04:49.071
It's just I get up
with the cock's crow.

04:51.465 --> 04:55.469
But if it's a bad time, I can
come back later... after.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.253
No, no, it's okay. Let's get you
moved into the Marbella.No. Yeah, yeah.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.689
I just need to find my shoes.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.343
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And underwear.

05:00.387 --> 05:03.564
So, how was your visit
with your dad?

05:03.607 --> 05:05.653
Any memories?

05:05.696 --> 05:09.352
Nope,
but I had a real good time.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.006
What did you guys do?

05:11.049 --> 05:12.268
Oh, you know, just

05:12.312 --> 05:14.792
caught up on episodes of NCIS.

05:14.836 --> 05:17.360
You guys watched television?

05:17.404 --> 05:20.972
It was nice. Quiet.

05:21.016 --> 05:24.802
But I'm back and ready for you
and all the talking.

05:27.283 --> 05:31.243
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And from one amnesiac
to another.

05:31.287 --> 05:32.897
But more sexy.

05:32.941 --> 05:36.031
I play a sexy amnesiac,
so maybe this hair...

05:36.074 --> 05:38.294
goes on thisside, huh?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.601
Like I forgot
how to part it properly.

05:40.644 --> 05:43.386
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You'll recall Rogelio was
launching the American version

05:43.430 --> 05:45.649
ofThe Passions of Santos. Hey, you.

05:45.693 --> 05:48.217
Why are you calling again?I just want to make sure

05:48.260 --> 05:49.305
you don't feel
too lonely at home.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.699
For the last time, I'm fine.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.222
Because I can delay it
until after chemo.

05:53.265 --> 05:55.267
Please don't say you can delay
until after chemo.

05:55.311 --> 05:56.878
I'm serious, Rogelio.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.836
Stop feeling guilty. I'm great.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.535
You're finally shooting The
Passions of Steve and Brenda.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.321
Now go have a great first day,

06:05.365 --> 06:06.540
and don't call again.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.411
And stay professional.
Remember, you got

06:08.455 --> 06:09.891
to a good place with River.
Don't mess it up.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.675
I won't.

06:11.719 --> 06:12.981
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

06:13.024 --> 06:15.331
it's important to note:
that was his plan.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.725
Good morning, Mr. Co-President.

06:17.768 --> 06:20.205
Good morning,
Madam Co-President.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.512
Shall we run lines?

06:22.556 --> 06:24.340
New script pages,
hot off the presses.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.081
Oh. Great.

06:27.430 --> 06:28.518
Ooh, fun.

06:28.562 --> 06:31.129
Oh, they made
my monologue even juicier.

06:31.173 --> 06:36.178
Well, I better get these babies
ready to emote.

06:39.268 --> 06:40.791
I thought we were running lines.

06:40.835 --> 06:42.576
First, I want
to have a word

06:42.619 --> 06:47.755
with those tasteless, talentless
hacks who call themselves...

06:47.798 --> 06:49.409
Writers!

06:49.452 --> 06:50.975
The finest wordsmiths

06:51.019 --> 06:53.543
in Miami
and my very favorite people.

06:53.587 --> 06:58.505
So, I found...Uh, Mr. De la Vega, this
is the production office.

06:58.548 --> 07:01.725
I see. Okay.

07:01.769 --> 07:04.467
Well... good producing.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.469
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Take two.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.515
Writers.

07:08.558 --> 07:11.866
My favorite people
in the whole world.

07:11.909 --> 07:13.868
I noticed my
monologue was missing

07:13.911 --> 07:16.392
from the latest script.
Not to worry.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.439
I'm sure that omitting
the most powerful moment

07:19.482 --> 07:22.877
in the pilot was
just an oversight.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.487
It's sweet but not too sweet.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.097
HANNAH:
You think it's coconut sugar?

07:27.403 --> 07:29.144
What are those... things?

07:29.187 --> 07:31.059
River boats.
She gave 'em to the whole crew

07:31.102 --> 07:32.364
to celebrate
the first day of shooting.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.803
I didn't know River
had a cookie line.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.897
She's just so nice.

07:42.940 --> 07:47.771
Agreed. So... very nice.

07:47.815 --> 07:50.078
You just seem sarcastic
when you say that.

07:50.121 --> 07:53.690
Oh, no. I'm very glad
to have this crazy calendar.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.431
PETRA:
Why did the vendor
send chardonnay

07:55.475 --> 07:56.693
when I specifically
ordered Chablis?

07:56.737 --> 07:58.390
Weren't you on the call
when I placed the order?

07:58.434 --> 08:00.392
I told you, always
be on my calls,

08:00.436 --> 08:02.569
taking notes so situations
like this are avoided.

08:02.612 --> 08:05.049
Find me the Chablis.

08:05.093 --> 08:06.921
Now!

08:08.879 --> 08:12.492
Turns out "temp" is just
another word for "incompetent."

08:12.535 --> 08:14.624
Anyway, welcome to the Marbella.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.800
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yup, looks like

08:16.844 --> 08:18.976
someone's still crushing
on Petra.

08:19.020 --> 08:21.283
Well, thanks
for putting us up.

08:21.326 --> 08:24.112
He could use a walk.
Come on, Bo. Come on.

08:25.243 --> 08:26.680
No one said anything
about a dog.

08:26.723 --> 08:28.464
Can you make an exception?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.466
Think of him as like
an emotional support animal.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.773
Emotional support for what?For coming back from the dead!

08:32.816 --> 08:35.558
He so much as lifts a
leg in here, he's out.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.255
And that goes
for Jason, too.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.214
Thanks. Trust me,
he needs that dog,

08:39.257 --> 08:40.998
because he is not
a people person.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.873
Oh, man.

08:45.916 --> 08:48.397
Maybe he's just
not a Jane person.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.356
Maybe not yet, but we're still
getting to know each other.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.054
It'll get better.

08:53.097 --> 08:55.317
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Totally agree. Either that...

08:55.360 --> 08:57.275
or way worse.

08:57.319 --> 09:00.061
Okay, so I don't cook,
but Michael loved frittatas,

09:00.104 --> 09:03.499
so this was the one thing
I learned to make.

09:04.587 --> 09:07.590
Pretty good, but I'd add ham.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.636
Maybe some kind of a meat.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.553
What are you gonna eat?

09:13.596 --> 09:16.425
Well, that was
for the both of us.

09:16.468 --> 09:18.645
So, what do you think?

09:20.647 --> 09:23.693
You're messing with me, right?

09:23.737 --> 09:26.827
There's no way
Michael liked this book.

09:26.870 --> 09:30.134
And so, yeah, Star Warswas
Michael's favorite movie.

09:30.178 --> 09:32.049
He actually didn't drink
anything all day

09:32.093 --> 09:34.182
when the last one came out,
just to ensure

09:34.225 --> 09:36.924
that he definitely wouldn't have
to go to the bathroom during it.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.493
Wake up!

09:45.889 --> 09:48.457
Okay, so I put together a
box of Michael's things.

09:48.500 --> 09:53.070
Oh, those were his...
your... LSAT scores.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.072
You passed.Wow.

09:55.116 --> 09:58.510
Crazy. I would never
want to be a lawyer.

09:58.554 --> 10:00.643
Oh, n-no, don't throw it away.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.645
I'll-I'll just keep it.Yeah?

10:02.689 --> 10:04.995
Yeah.
Sure.

10:05.039 --> 10:07.389
Oh, those are from your car.
You can have those if you want.

10:07.432 --> 10:10.435
Uh, no, thanks.
What happened to the car?

10:10.479 --> 10:12.046
Oh, I-I sold it.

10:12.089 --> 10:13.482
Well, how much you get?

10:13.525 --> 10:16.659
Like, 1,200 bucks, I think.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.661
Can I have that, then?

10:18.705 --> 10:20.532
Are you serious?

10:20.576 --> 10:22.230
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
He looks dead serious.

10:22.273 --> 10:24.406
Or should I say
"back from the dead serious"?

10:24.449 --> 10:26.190
Or like half?

10:26.234 --> 10:28.845
Could use the money
more than a license plate.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.542
What?

10:30.586 --> 10:32.893
Nothing. You know,
maybe I can go

10:32.936 --> 10:35.199
to the used car dealership
and get your car back.

10:35.243 --> 10:37.680
Oh, I'm sure they'll remember me
since I was the one sobbing

10:37.724 --> 10:39.769
while I handed over the keys
to my dead husband's car.

10:39.813 --> 10:42.076
Why would they give you
the car back

10:42.119 --> 10:43.817
when you already spent
the money?

10:43.860 --> 10:45.514
I didn't actually mean
you'd be getting it back.

10:45.557 --> 10:47.124
Oh, you were being sarcastic?Yeah, I was being sarcastic,

10:47.168 --> 10:49.213
because you were
asking for the money.Yeah, I'm asking

10:49.257 --> 10:50.693
for money.
Do you not need money?

10:52.956 --> 10:54.262
It's the lawyer.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.133
Hi. This is Jane.

10:56.177 --> 10:57.831
Okay. Got it.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.703
Got it.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.618
Great news.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.402
We're still married.

11:11.322 --> 11:13.368
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, friends, you'll recall

11:13.411 --> 11:16.023
we left Jane and Jason... Married? Seriously?

11:16.066 --> 11:18.634
For now. Apparently
Michael's death certificate

11:18.678 --> 11:19.940
nullified
our marriage certificate,

11:19.983 --> 11:21.898
but his death certificate
is now nullified.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.334
So we have an appointment

11:23.378 --> 11:25.685
to ask the judge
to uphold the dissolution.

11:25.728 --> 11:26.729
When?

11:26.773 --> 11:28.078
In six months.

11:28.122 --> 11:30.080
Trust me. I don't want
to be married to Jason

11:30.124 --> 11:31.647
for another six months.
But what can I do?

11:31.691 --> 11:32.996
What most people do
when they don't want

11:33.040 --> 11:34.041
to be married anymore.

11:34.737 --> 11:35.651
Divorce.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.087
Rafael, I'm Catholic.

11:37.131 --> 11:37.871
And...?

11:37.914 --> 11:39.307
And...

11:40.787 --> 11:42.702
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Sorry. That was dramatic.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.834
But so is damnation.

11:44.878 --> 11:45.661
Jane?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.837
Catholics can't divorce.

11:47.881 --> 11:50.666
Yeah, but don't you think they'd
make an exception in this case?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.450
I don't know. But if I just wait
the six months,

11:52.494 --> 11:53.887
I won't have to go
against the Church.

11:53.930 --> 11:55.671
But then again, you've broken
other church rules.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.065
Like birth control,
lots of premarital sex.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.764
Marriage is different.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.200
It's a sacrament.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.115
Okay.

12:05.159 --> 12:06.769
If that's all it is.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.031
Of course that's all it is.

12:08.075 --> 12:10.207
Good old-fashioned
Catholic guilt.

12:10.251 --> 12:13.776
Then again, guilt comes from
the inside, not the outside.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.213
It's Dennis.
I need to go meet

12:16.257 --> 12:18.781
my sister at the precinct. Then
we're gonna head to the prison,

12:18.825 --> 12:22.002
see if Rose will tell Luisa
why she wiped Michael's memory.

12:22.045 --> 12:25.222
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow. There's a sentence
you don't hear every day.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.615
Do you think Rose will tell her?

12:26.658 --> 12:28.138
I can't guarantee it,

12:28.182 --> 12:29.879
but I'm definitely
your best shot.

12:29.923 --> 12:30.880
Agreed.

12:30.924 --> 12:31.794
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw!

12:31.838 --> 12:34.014
You remember Dennis, right?

12:46.678 --> 12:49.377
I just want to make sure
you're okay with meeting Rose.

12:49.420 --> 12:52.859
I know you've had some...
struggles in the past.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.425
Not struggles.

12:54.469 --> 12:56.427
Complete mental breakdowns.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.429
It's important
to just say it and own it.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.083
Yes, I was an unstable alcoholic

13:00.127 --> 13:01.911
who fell in love
with a sociopath.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.609
Again and again...

13:04.653 --> 13:06.089
and again.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.177
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And again.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.918
But I'm not that person anymore.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.920
Because now I'm sober.

13:10.964 --> 13:13.531
And... I'm serious.

13:13.575 --> 13:15.795
I can totally handle Rose.
And if she even tries

13:15.838 --> 13:18.798
to lure me in with her magnetic
eyes and electric sexual energy,

13:18.841 --> 13:20.103
I'm just gonna think

13:20.147 --> 13:21.801
about the truly evil things
that she's done.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.978
In fact,
I even made a list.

13:32.594 --> 13:33.813
And I'll be, uh, coming as well,

13:33.856 --> 13:35.423
for moral support.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.425
Great. Good call.

13:37.468 --> 13:38.774
So, look,

13:38.818 --> 13:42.169
we found this number
buried in Michael's files.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.779
We think it may have
something to do

13:43.823 --> 13:44.780
with where she's hiding
her money.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.912
Mention it to her.

13:45.955 --> 13:47.827
Let's see how she reacts.

13:49.176 --> 13:51.134
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Also waiting for a reaction...

13:51.178 --> 13:52.527
What do you think?

13:52.570 --> 13:54.921
Your very own...

13:54.964 --> 13:57.924
RoBoats.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.842
Thanks, Rogelio.Of course.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.540
And, look, where I come
from, the writer is God.

14:05.583 --> 14:08.282
So I will never question
a decision you've made.

14:08.325 --> 14:09.196
Appreciate that.

14:09.239 --> 14:10.197
But if you want to thank me

14:10.240 --> 14:12.416
for such a kind offering...

14:12.460 --> 14:13.896
restore my monologue.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.898
Sorry. No can do.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.726
But I bought you actual boats.

14:17.769 --> 14:21.904
Which are much better than those
cheap, carb-heavy River Rafts.

14:21.948 --> 14:24.298
It's not personal, Rogelio.

14:24.341 --> 14:25.865
You still have your moment.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.345
But my moment is...

14:28.389 --> 14:30.217
shorter.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.435
River has a
whole speech.

14:31.479 --> 14:32.915
And now all I say is

14:32.959 --> 14:34.917
"I don't understand
what's going on."

14:34.961 --> 14:37.006
Sometimes less is more.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.007
I don't understand.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.095
"What's going on."

14:39.139 --> 14:40.575
I don't understand
what's going on.

14:40.618 --> 14:41.924
See? Sounds great.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.927
No! I'm saying that I,
Rog...elio de la Vega,

14:44.971 --> 14:46.320
don't understand.

14:46.363 --> 14:49.714
How could you cut my monologue
down to one line?

14:49.758 --> 14:51.281
We thought this line

14:51.325 --> 14:53.805
was a better reflection
of the character.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.720
Where he's at in his journey.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.505
With no memories.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.028
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

14:59.072 --> 15:00.987
that's when Rogelio's
two worlds collided,

15:01.030 --> 15:02.989
as if by design.

15:03.032 --> 15:04.251
Oh, yeah?

15:04.294 --> 15:06.862
And do you know anyone
with amnesia?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.429
Because I

15:08.472 --> 15:12.259
happen to know
a real-life amnesiac.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.261
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here, now.

15:14.304 --> 15:17.917
My dad wants to hire you

15:17.960 --> 15:21.616
as an amnesia consultant
on his telenovela.

15:21.659 --> 15:24.053
What's a... "telly-novela"?

15:25.098 --> 15:26.229
A TV show.

15:26.273 --> 15:28.579
My-my favorite kind, actually.

15:28.623 --> 15:31.060
Michael and I watched one
the night that we met.

15:31.104 --> 15:34.368
They're like... soap
operas on steroids.

15:34.411 --> 15:37.588
You know, lots of twists
and turns and huge reveals

15:37.632 --> 15:39.590
but with so much heart.

15:39.634 --> 15:40.417
Sold.

15:40.461 --> 15:41.636
Ah.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.943
600 bucks, I'll consult.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.075
Then we'll call it even
on the car.

15:46.119 --> 15:49.905
Got it. I'll let him know.

15:49.949 --> 15:53.213
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And suddenly, friends,
a twist no one

15:53.256 --> 15:54.954
saw coming. What is it?

15:54.997 --> 15:58.000
This shot glass
looks so familiar.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.915
We were out,

15:59.959 --> 16:01.830
you and me.

16:01.873 --> 16:03.136
It was night.

16:03.179 --> 16:04.920
We were on, um,

16:04.964 --> 16:06.182
Bourbon Street

16:06.226 --> 16:07.967
in New Orleans.

16:08.010 --> 16:11.579
And there was a guy who spilled
a drink down your back.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.015
You freaked out.

16:13.059 --> 16:16.018
I've never been to New Orleans.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.977
Or Bourbon Street.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.501
Damn.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.068
You're right.

16:22.111 --> 16:26.028
I was remembering an episode
of NCIS: New Orleans.

16:26.072 --> 16:29.814
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
At least
Jane didn't see it coming.

16:30.815 --> 16:32.034
I'll be right back.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.080
I-I need some air.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.190
Jane.

16:57.233 --> 16:58.408
Are you okay?

16:58.452 --> 17:00.628
I just realized something.

17:00.671 --> 17:03.022
I'm scared to get a divorce,

17:03.065 --> 17:04.893
because what if Michael
gets his memory back?

17:04.936 --> 17:06.155
I mean, if that happened,
I don't know

17:06.199 --> 17:08.070
what I would do
or how I would feel.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.289
At all.

17:13.597 --> 17:17.645
I'm so sorry that I had to
run out. Something came up.

17:17.688 --> 17:19.951
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
A full-fledged panic attack
is what came up.

17:19.995 --> 17:21.083
What was it?

17:21.127 --> 17:23.607
M-My mom's cancer
flared up, actually.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.696
A-Anyway, I will
see you on set.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.394
600 bucks. Yay!

17:27.437 --> 17:31.180
Okay, now-now I have
to call Rafael.

17:31.224 --> 17:32.225
Whoa, slow down.

17:32.268 --> 17:33.574
No, I have to.My cancer's

17:33.617 --> 17:34.792
flaring up.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.882
Just think for a second, okay?

17:42.104 --> 17:44.672
What are you
gonna say to him?

17:44.715 --> 17:48.241
That if Michael's
memory comes back,

17:48.284 --> 17:49.764
that it'll be
very confusing.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.505
I think he knows that.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.856
And I don't know if
I'd want to divorce him,

17:54.899 --> 17:57.337
so it wasn't only Catholic
guilt like I said.

17:57.380 --> 17:58.947
What was it, then?

17:58.990 --> 18:01.080
Would you want to be
with Michael?

18:01.123 --> 18:03.560
What? No. I love Rafael.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.693
I-It's more that...

18:05.736 --> 18:08.087
How could I look
Michael in the eye and say,

18:08.130 --> 18:10.567
"Hey, you were back
for two whole weeks

18:10.611 --> 18:12.047
and then I filed
for divorce"?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.831
Okay. So it is guilt,

18:13.875 --> 18:15.659
just from a different place.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.661
Which I should tell Rafael.

18:17.705 --> 18:18.923
And also I should tell him

18:18.967 --> 18:21.056
that if Michael got
his memory back,

18:21.100 --> 18:23.537
I'm a little scared
that I'd have feelings.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.887
But I don't want to
and I probably wouldn't?

18:25.930 --> 18:27.845
Yeah, see, I'd wait a beat
with that last part.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.847
It's all hypothetical.

18:29.891 --> 18:32.894
Sort out how you're feeling
a little more first.

18:32.937 --> 18:34.548
Yeah.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.071
He's actually with Rose now,

18:36.115 --> 18:37.812
trying to find out
why she did this.

18:37.855 --> 18:39.379
Really?LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Truly.

18:39.422 --> 18:41.685
Well, this is disappointing.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.731
Whyare you here?

18:43.774 --> 18:46.908
I was veryclear that
I would only speak to Luisa.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.257
Well,
that's too bad,

18:48.301 --> 18:50.085
'cause you're talking
to both of us.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.565
Oh.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.393
Did you come to thank me?

18:54.785 --> 18:56.744
I took out the competition,

18:56.787 --> 18:58.920
got you the girl.

18:58.963 --> 19:01.096
Why did you wipe
Michael's memory?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.446
Is that really what you want
to ask me?

19:03.490 --> 19:04.795
Or are you trying
to find out

19:04.839 --> 19:07.581
if what I did to Michael
is reversible?

19:07.624 --> 19:09.670
Afraid that if Michael
gets his memory back,

19:09.713 --> 19:11.193
Jane will go
running back

19:11.237 --> 19:14.892
to her one true love
like she always does?

19:22.770 --> 19:24.206
Let me talk
to her alone.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.077
No! No way!

19:26.121 --> 19:27.644
This is what Rose does.

19:27.688 --> 19:29.733
Don't let her
get to you.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.692
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Too late. She was so rude.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.824
I will get an answer.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.609
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Good. We're all waiting.

19:35.652 --> 19:36.914
Here's the answer.

19:36.958 --> 19:40.135
A real-life amnesiac
standing right here.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.919
I brought him here
as a consultant

19:41.963 --> 19:46.446
because amnesiacs, as a group,
deserve accurate representation.

19:46.489 --> 19:49.927
And he read the monologue
as it was, and he lovedit.

19:49.971 --> 19:50.711
Right, Jason?

19:50.754 --> 19:52.103
Yep.

19:52.147 --> 19:53.714
True.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.241
So, when you first came
back to your old life,

19:59.285 --> 20:01.243
what was it like?

20:01.287 --> 20:02.940
Oh. Just...

20:02.984 --> 20:05.073
Well, we have our answer.
Monologue stays.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.293
Let's go, Jason.WRITER: No, wait.
You brought us

20:07.336 --> 20:08.903
an actual amnesiac.
This is incredible.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.644
We want to hear from him.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.298
So, what was it like?

20:12.341 --> 20:14.865
Oh, I was
just so confused.Processing everything

20:14.909 --> 20:16.737
in a lengthy speech.Um, there was
just all this stuff

20:16.780 --> 20:18.304
coming at me.You know? Okay,
here we go.

20:18.347 --> 20:20.131
Um, I was just like...

20:20.175 --> 20:21.742
"What?"

20:21.785 --> 20:24.310
So that's what
you said? "What?"

20:24.353 --> 20:26.529
That's pretty much
all I could say.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.270
That's what
we're gonna do.

20:28.314 --> 20:29.880
Cut the line and have
him just say "What?"

20:29.924 --> 20:30.925
What?

20:30.968 --> 20:31.839
Perfect.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.885
Authenticity
every time. Yes.

20:35.930 --> 20:36.887
Oh, my God.

20:36.931 --> 20:37.888
What?

20:37.932 --> 20:39.716
Is that River Fields?

20:39.760 --> 20:40.761
ROGELIO:
It is.

20:40.804 --> 20:41.979
You work on her show?

20:42.023 --> 20:44.547
We are costars of ourshow.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.027
Can you introduce me?

20:46.070 --> 20:47.376
Sure.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.986
Oh, man.

20:49.030 --> 20:51.380
The guys at the ranch
are gonna be like, "What?"

20:53.077 --> 20:53.991
ROGELIO:
River, this is

20:54.035 --> 20:55.906
Jason, our real-life amnesiac.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.908
Ms. Fields,

20:57.952 --> 21:00.389
ma'am, I-I just want to say
I'm a huge fan.

21:00.433 --> 21:04.219
Um, you're just...
awesome.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.089
ROGELIO:
This man

21:05.133 --> 21:06.395
won't stop talking.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.876
This is why I need a monologue!

21:08.919 --> 21:11.357
I-I feel like
I'm dreaming right now.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.184
Oh, stop. The dream is mine.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.665
I can't even imagine
what you're going through.

21:15.709 --> 21:19.582
And just know that if you
ever need anything from me,

21:19.626 --> 21:22.933
and it doesn't conflict with
previously scheduled events,

21:22.977 --> 21:25.501
I would be happy to
help you any way I can.

21:25.545 --> 21:29.026
Wow, that's so generous of you.

21:29.070 --> 21:31.681
Of course it is,
but you deserve it

21:31.725 --> 21:33.379
after all you've
been through.

21:33.422 --> 21:35.206
You're a victim.

21:35.250 --> 21:39.210
You're a real
victimized victim.

21:39.254 --> 21:42.475
But instead of whining about
it like some people who whine

21:42.518 --> 21:44.085
about every little thing
like a shorter monologue,

21:44.128 --> 21:48.089
you keep moving forward.

21:48.132 --> 21:50.134
I can't believe what
you've been through.

21:50.178 --> 21:51.440
But I know Jane.

21:51.484 --> 21:54.487
I'm sure she's taking
good care of you

21:54.530 --> 21:56.880
and giving you the
support that you need.

21:56.924 --> 21:59.013
Okay, moving on.

21:59.056 --> 22:01.015
Time for the big reveal.

22:01.058 --> 22:03.496
Why did you give Michael
amnesia?

22:03.539 --> 22:05.976
No pleasantries?

22:06.020 --> 22:08.327
We're not even gonna say hello?

22:08.370 --> 22:10.372
Did you get a tan?

22:10.416 --> 22:12.505
It looks good.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.550
It's none of your business.

22:14.594 --> 22:17.597
And, yes, thank you.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.861
If only this glass partition
weren't here...

22:20.904 --> 22:23.254
Stop.

22:23.298 --> 22:26.649
That is not why I'm here.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.347
Tell me why you did it.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.784
For us.

22:30.827 --> 22:34.048
You and I had just
gotten back into town

22:34.091 --> 22:36.180
after our submarine tour.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.661
I had my Eileen face on.

22:38.705 --> 22:40.663
And I ran into Michael.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.012
And my phone fell.

22:42.056 --> 22:44.537
As we both bent down
to pick it up,

22:44.580 --> 22:47.278
my mask came unglued,
just a little.

22:47.322 --> 22:50.064
I didn't know if he saw,
but he and I

22:50.107 --> 22:51.761
were gonna be formally
introduced later that week.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.981
And when he saw me with you,

22:54.024 --> 22:55.852
he could have put
two and two together.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.550
Don't you see, Luisa?

22:57.593 --> 22:59.421
I did it for us.

22:59.465 --> 23:02.555
No.

23:02.598 --> 23:05.514
You did it for yourself so that
you wouldn't end up in prison.

23:05.558 --> 23:07.124
If that were the case, I would
have just killed Michael.

23:07.168 --> 23:09.344
But I promised you

23:09.388 --> 23:12.434
that I wouldn't
kill anymore, so...

23:12.478 --> 23:15.219
I faked his death
with a paralytic,

23:15.263 --> 23:17.091
and I hired some fake EMTs,

23:17.134 --> 23:18.962
and, and I gave him amnesia.

23:19.006 --> 23:21.051
Which was way harder,
by the way.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.531
That is so...

23:22.575 --> 23:25.012
Romantic?Diabolical.

23:25.055 --> 23:27.362
And I don't believe you.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.757
I think it has something to do
with this number.

23:30.800 --> 23:34.587
So you're working
with the police now?

23:36.502 --> 23:37.894
What if I am?

23:37.938 --> 23:41.463
Tell them there's no chance
in hell

23:41.507 --> 23:45.206
they'll ever figure out
what that number is.

23:46.163 --> 23:47.991
FIRST AD:
Cut!

23:48.035 --> 23:50.124
We got it.
Moving on to the next scene.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.213
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wait, that's it? No processing?

23:52.256 --> 23:54.258
Let's go people, move.
Quick, quick.

23:54.302 --> 23:55.956
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Got it. Here we go. Quickly.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.174
Where's Jason?
He left.

23:57.218 --> 23:58.524
Of course. Why would
he let me know first?

23:58.567 --> 24:00.090
I know. Jason is so rude.
That guy's no Michael.

24:00.134 --> 24:01.440
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Okay, this is too fast.

24:01.483 --> 24:02.571
Let's slow down.

24:02.615 --> 24:04.486
Tell me the truth.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.619
Did your mom seem lonely
when you left her?

24:06.662 --> 24:08.577
I mean, a little.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.579
But it's okay, Dad.

24:10.623 --> 24:12.059
She wants you to do this,

24:12.102 --> 24:13.190
so stop calling her
every five minutes

24:13.234 --> 24:14.888
and stop feeling guilty.

24:14.931 --> 24:16.019
How do you do that?

24:16.063 --> 24:18.500
Let me know when
you figure it out.

24:18.544 --> 24:21.068
Hey, hi, how'd it go?

24:21.111 --> 24:24.506
Well, Rose told Luisa
why she did it.

24:24.550 --> 24:25.812
And?

24:25.855 --> 24:28.249
And...

24:28.292 --> 24:31.121
It was random.

24:31.165 --> 24:32.645
What?

24:32.688 --> 24:34.211
She ran into Michael
at a coffee shop.

24:34.255 --> 24:38.520
Her mask came off
and she thought he saw.

24:38.564 --> 24:39.826
That's it?

24:39.869 --> 24:41.523
That's it.

24:41.567 --> 24:45.179
So if he'd gone somewhere else
for coffee first...

24:47.007 --> 24:49.139
You okay?LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And friends,

24:49.183 --> 24:50.967
to play God for a minute,

24:51.011 --> 24:52.665
here's what Jane wanted
to say...

24:52.708 --> 24:54.318
No. I'm not.

24:54.362 --> 24:55.537
There was a moment today

24:55.581 --> 24:57.278
where I thought Michael got
his memory back,

24:57.321 --> 24:59.280
and I had a panic attack
because I am so scared

24:59.323 --> 25:01.064
of what would happen if he did,

25:01.108 --> 25:03.937
and I don't want anything
to happen because I love you,

25:03.980 --> 25:06.548
and I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.158
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But instead, she said...

25:08.202 --> 25:11.553
Yeah. Hanging in. Mm. You?

25:11.597 --> 25:14.556
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And friends, here's what he wanted to say...

25:14.600 --> 25:17.167
In hell.

25:17.211 --> 25:21.128
I'm just so terrified of
Michael's memory coming back.

25:21.171 --> 25:24.566
Please, Jane, promise me...

25:24.610 --> 25:27.787
that no matter what happens...
you'll choose me.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.571
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But instead, he just said...

25:29.615 --> 25:31.268
Same.

25:33.836 --> 25:35.359
MATEO:
You look stressed, Mommy.

25:35.403 --> 25:38.580
Oh, I'm just having a hard day,
Mr. Sweetface.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.234
Don't worry, in
the CCD they told us

25:40.277 --> 25:42.802
just to be a good person
and trust God has a plan.

25:42.845 --> 25:45.674
You know, it's interesting
that you say that.

25:45.718 --> 25:48.329
Because I have a friend and
she's a really good person.

25:48.372 --> 25:49.809
Or she tries to be, at least.

25:49.852 --> 25:52.115
And now she's in
this crazy situation

25:52.159 --> 25:53.813
and the plan isn't so clear.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.075
What situation?

25:55.118 --> 25:57.817
Well...

25:57.860 --> 26:01.168
She had a puppy and the puppy
died, so she got a new puppy.

26:01.211 --> 26:03.736
But then, out of nowhere,
the other puppy was found.

26:03.779 --> 26:06.303
Where?
Wandering.

26:06.347 --> 26:07.653
Like Moses?

26:07.696 --> 26:10.525
No. Not like Moses.
In Montana.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.353
The point is is that now she has
two puppies,

26:12.396 --> 26:13.572
but her parents won't let her
have two puppies.

26:13.615 --> 26:14.660
So what's the plan for that?

26:14.703 --> 26:16.139
I don't know.

26:16.183 --> 26:17.401
Exactly, 'cause
there is no plan.

26:17.445 --> 26:18.925
My friend has to
come up with a plan.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.535
But religion
makes it seem like

26:20.579 --> 26:21.754
it'll all just magically
work itself out,

26:21.797 --> 26:23.016
which is totally false.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.147
It is?

26:24.191 --> 26:25.453
Yes.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.542
You know, you may be
a little too young for CCD.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.675
You're not going anymore.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.328
Okay. Do you think we can have
the other puppy though?

26:31.372 --> 26:33.374
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Holy hell.Mm.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.032
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes,

26:39.075 --> 26:41.077
we last left our Jane
having a crisis of...

26:41.121 --> 26:44.515
Faith. Ugh.

26:44.559 --> 26:47.214
Move. You're in the way.

26:48.868 --> 26:50.565
Jason. You're early.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.611
I haven't finished gathering
the rest of Michael's...

26:52.654 --> 26:53.786
I'm out.

26:53.829 --> 26:55.135
What do you mean, you're out?

26:55.178 --> 26:56.702
I don't want to go through boxes

26:56.745 --> 26:58.529
of your Michael crap anymore.

26:58.573 --> 26:59.966
That's what I mean.

27:00.009 --> 27:02.142
Wait. What? Why?
You can't just quit.

27:02.185 --> 27:03.534
I'm not just quitting.

27:03.578 --> 27:05.449
Really?
Then what do you call it?

27:05.493 --> 27:07.408
I call it walking away
from a bad experience.

27:07.451 --> 27:10.063
Well, it hasn't
exactly been rainbows

27:10.106 --> 27:12.108
and puppies for me either;
at least I'm trying.

27:12.152 --> 27:14.110
I'm trying, too,
but I can't do anything right.

27:14.154 --> 27:16.112
Like with Michael's stuff,

27:16.156 --> 27:17.505
you won't let me throw it away,
you won't let me sell it.

27:17.548 --> 27:18.637
Fine. Do whatever
you want with it.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.160
It's not that.Then what is it?

27:20.203 --> 27:21.422
It's that every time
I do something,

27:21.465 --> 27:24.294
or say something,
you're disappointed.

27:24.338 --> 27:26.732
And I get it. I'm not him.

27:26.775 --> 27:29.517
But it's also not my fault
that I'm different.

27:29.560 --> 27:33.913
And River Fields made me realize
that I'm the victim here.

27:35.392 --> 27:38.482
Anyway, like I said, I'm done.

27:38.526 --> 27:41.137
JANE:
I just feel so guilty...

27:41.181 --> 27:45.228
Jason's right. I'm disappointed
that he's not Michael, but...

27:45.272 --> 27:47.578
I don't know what I would
do if he were Michael.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.232
And none of that

27:49.276 --> 27:50.712
has anything to with Jason,

27:50.756 --> 27:52.148
who I'm not helping at all.

28:05.161 --> 28:07.555
You're right. Yeah.

28:07.598 --> 28:09.252
So I'll just start over.

28:09.296 --> 28:10.863
Get to know Jason.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.038
Mm.

28:12.081 --> 28:13.256
JANE:
Jorge.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.215
You two seemed to hit it off.
Any tips?

28:45.375 --> 28:49.249
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And from one good team...
to another.

28:49.292 --> 28:53.819
Rogelio. I told you
I was fine at home.

28:53.862 --> 28:55.429
I know. But I was
feeling too guilty,

28:55.472 --> 28:58.040
and I can't act
if I feel guilty.

28:58.084 --> 29:01.174
And like you said,
this telenovela is everything,

29:01.217 --> 29:04.090
so my acting has
to be top-notch.

29:04.133 --> 29:05.918
I promise,

29:05.961 --> 29:08.964
this is not about you,
it's about me.

29:09.008 --> 29:11.532
Now sit, please,
so I can work in peace.

29:11.575 --> 29:14.230
Okay, let's get moving, please.

29:14.274 --> 29:15.884
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Man, this dude needs to stop
riding me.

29:15.928 --> 29:17.625
I'm moving.
So Rogelio went back to work,

29:17.668 --> 29:19.758
his guilty conscience lifted,
and...

29:19.801 --> 29:20.802
Action!

29:20.846 --> 29:22.151
I know you don't remember

29:22.195 --> 29:24.632
who you are, but I do.

29:24.675 --> 29:28.375
And I will remember our love
for the both of us.

29:28.418 --> 29:31.552
This is still your face

29:31.595 --> 29:33.772
that I gazed upon for hours.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.817
And these are still
your hands,

a real amnesiac does it.

31:00.510 --> 31:01.642
Much more natural.

31:01.685 --> 31:04.297
Um. Uh, I'm sorry
to just drop by,

31:04.340 --> 31:06.429
but I was thinking
about what you said,

31:06.473 --> 31:08.083
and I wanted to apologize.

31:08.127 --> 31:09.519
Okay.

Uh, I'm really sorry

31:12.392 --> 31:15.786
that I've been acting
disappointed; that's not fair.

who Michael was

31:21.401 --> 31:24.186
I haven't learned

What?We went line dancing,

36:50.512 --> 36:53.341
I do. Because you're
his wife, Jane.

Of course he thinks
you're still interested.

36:54.864 --> 36:56.257
You know I don't want
to be married to him.

36:56.301 --> 36:57.345
Well, then, get a divorce.

36:57.389 --> 36:59.173
Be done with it.I just feel so guilty.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.306
Oh, come on,
enough with this Catholic guilt.

37:01.349 --> 37:02.698
It's not because I'm Catholic.

37:02.742 --> 37:05.527
It's because I wish
he never came back.

37:05.571 --> 37:08.617
And I'm a terrible person
to wish that

37:08.661 --> 37:12.578

So happy.

37:18.627 --> 37:21.326
With you, with our life.

37:21.369 --> 37:23.241
Which isn't fair to him.

37:23.284 --> 37:25.460
None of this is fair.Still.

37:25.504 --> 37:28.333
I'm wracked with guilt
every second.

37:28.376 --> 37:31.031
But maybe that's Catholicism.

37:31.074 --> 37:34.513
Which is why I took Mateo
out of CCD, by the way.What?

37:34.556 --> 37:37.342
I just doesn't feel like there's
a plan right now, you know?

37:37.385 --> 37:40.432
To anything. And if there's not,
then what's the point of it all?

37:40.475 --> 37:42.434

to believe in?

plan or no plan,

37:49.919 --> 37:51.573
it's been a force
for good in your life.

37:51.617 --> 37:54.489

Fine. I'll be in touch
as soon as I get another set.
