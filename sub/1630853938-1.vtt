WEBVTT

00:09.792 --> 00:11.837
Curbside only.

00:11.881 --> 00:15.058
If you know what you're
looking for, we can provide.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.668
It's just the way
it works for me.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.670
- But you're not open.
- Not for browsing, no.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.194
Just for curbside.

00:20.237 --> 00:22.065
You really don't want
to do that, huh?

00:22.109 --> 00:23.458
I don't want people in here.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.155
- Okay.
- It's a place

00:25.199 --> 00:27.027
where the virus can catch.

00:29.464 --> 00:32.815
Not for coming in.
Just for curbside.

00:32.858 --> 00:35.731
If you know what you're
looking for, we might have it.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.472
If you wanna look
on the website,

00:37.515 --> 00:39.300
we have lots of pictures
of the books.

00:39.343 --> 00:41.084
But we're not
letting anyone in.

00:41.128 --> 00:44.000
Even you.
Man is not alone.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.871
I thought you said "Nan."

00:45.915 --> 00:50.006
I thought it was like...
a teenager book.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.269
It's called,
"The Pull of the Stars."

00:56.491 --> 00:59.972
- All right.
- And then some other stuff.

01:00.016 --> 01:02.192
Uh, Judaica?

01:02.236 --> 01:04.281
Can I recommend
something there?

01:04.325 --> 01:05.630
- All right.
- Okay, hold on.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.719
'Cause I got somebody
at the door.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.156
Let me ask him what he wants,
and I'll be right back.

01:09.199 --> 01:10.809
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.768
So you're not
letting folks in...

01:12.811 --> 01:15.684
- No, no browsing inside.
- Oh, that's a shame.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.773
I know. I know.
I apologize.

01:17.816 --> 01:19.296
No, that's all right.
Are you Matt?

01:19.340 --> 01:21.037
- Yeah.
- Well I'm glad

01:21.081 --> 01:23.387
- The Bookstore's healthy.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:23.431 --> 01:26.956
I... yeah, so,
is there a place online...

01:26.999 --> 01:29.567
The Bookstore...
The Bookstore website,

01:29.611 --> 01:31.265
you can browse.
And we have pictures

01:31.308 --> 01:33.876
of a lot of the books
on the website.

01:33.919 --> 01:35.791
So you can't order
on the website,

01:35.834 --> 01:38.402
but you can call me
or email me.

01:38.446 --> 01:40.056
Okay, perfect,
thank you very much.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.492
- What's your name?
- I'm Alex.

01:41.536 --> 01:43.146
I'm a TV writer from LA.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.887
And a couple
of my friends are like,

01:44.930 --> 01:46.236
if you go out there you have
to go this bookstore.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.933
Right.
Yeah, yeah.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.413
Glad to see you're open
a little bit.

01:49.457 --> 01:50.719
- Right.
- But thank you...

01:50.762 --> 01:52.155
How long are you here for?

01:52.199 --> 01:53.983
About another week
and a half.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.941
- Okay, so we'll see you again.
- A hundred percent.

01:55.985 --> 01:57.856
Good, thanks, man.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.207
Okay,
so... um...

02:01.686 --> 02:04.124
[distant voice on phone]

02:15.526 --> 02:17.963
New nonfiction?

02:18.007 --> 02:19.313
Okay...

02:20.966 --> 02:22.272
Right.

02:26.189 --> 02:28.583
Okay, hold on one second,
'cause I'm... getting

02:28.626 --> 02:31.455
a delivery, and I've got
to get him in and out.

02:35.459 --> 02:36.939
I've got one more
for you, sir.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.288
Thank you, man.

02:38.332 --> 02:40.247
It's just really hard.

02:40.290 --> 02:44.207
People go through hard times.

02:44.251 --> 02:47.906
It's just, it's like...
it's so boring.

02:47.950 --> 02:50.518
It's so different.

02:50.561 --> 02:52.172
From everything.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.394
[phone ringing]

02:58.656 --> 03:00.876
[laughing]

03:00.919 --> 03:03.357
[phone ringing]

03:03.400 --> 03:05.097
Hello, Bookstore.

03:05.141 --> 03:07.665
[soft guitar]

03:07.709 --> 03:10.059
[chuckling]
Okay, whatcha lookin' for?

03:17.240 --> 03:20.417
The first line is,
"I love autumn.

03:20.461 --> 03:22.985
That time of year agrees
well with memories."

03:50.317 --> 03:52.362
Somebody's gotta
put them away.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.364
And when... you do this,

03:54.408 --> 03:56.192
When you're the one
whose putting the books away,

03:56.236 --> 03:57.976
you see... everything.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.631
You see...
what you have room for.

04:00.675 --> 04:02.894
Then...

04:02.938 --> 04:04.940
sometimes, then
somebody comes in

04:04.983 --> 04:08.248
later that day,
and you have something

04:08.291 --> 04:11.207
very, you know...

04:11.251 --> 04:13.992
recent in your memory
of a book.

04:14.036 --> 04:16.343
"Oh, I have
just the one for you."

04:16.386 --> 04:18.258
It's so much fun to do that.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.738
[chuckling]

04:20.782 --> 04:22.523
The whole thing is,
it's so much fun.

04:31.053 --> 04:34.056
Hello.
Help with anything?

04:34.099 --> 04:36.145
[woman] Just looking.
It's-- you know,

04:36.188 --> 04:38.234
- it's like a candy store.
- It is a candy store.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.367
Just, you know...
are your hands clean?

04:40.410 --> 04:42.543
[chuckling]

04:42.586 --> 04:44.806
The wine bar is open.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.721
And our motto is,
you can't drink all day

04:46.764 --> 04:48.940
unless you start
in the morning.

04:48.984 --> 04:51.987
- So...
- I'm too old for that.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.249
- [chuckling] Oh.
- I remember doing that.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.034
- All right then.
- A long time ago.

04:56.078 --> 04:58.080
- I-- now I remember you.
- It's always like,

04:58.123 --> 05:00.082
if you start,
you gotta keep going.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.692
Otherwise you'll fall asleep.

05:07.394 --> 05:10.048
Died in 1988.

05:10.092 --> 05:12.181
I remember her stuff though.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.620
A biography
of Mary Cassatt, right.

05:18.143 --> 05:20.407
And a diary.
She did a diary.

05:20.450 --> 05:21.799
Two memoirs.

05:24.149 --> 05:27.675
People walk in,
and they have, you know...

05:27.718 --> 05:30.199
all the various aspects
of their lives.

05:30.242 --> 05:33.028
And... And there's
a book for everyone.

05:33.071 --> 05:35.683
- [laughing]
- True.

05:35.726 --> 05:38.381
I got a book for you.

05:38.425 --> 05:39.904
[woman] How about this one?
This one was really good.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.166
- You loved this one.
- Yeah, I did love

05:41.210 --> 05:42.907
- that one.
- This is great.

05:42.951 --> 05:44.387
A woman came in the store,
and she said,

05:44.431 --> 05:46.215
"Do you have
'The Secret Life of Trees'?"

05:46.258 --> 05:47.956
And I do,
it's down here

05:47.999 --> 05:49.305
in the nature section,
so I said,

05:49.349 --> 05:51.176
did you read
"The Overstory"?

05:51.220 --> 05:53.396
And she said, "Oh, I thought
it was contrived."

05:53.440 --> 05:54.832
Fine, you know, that's,
everybody, you can...

05:54.876 --> 05:56.268
- Right.
- ...have your own opinion.

05:56.312 --> 05:58.140
- Right. Right.
- So... I get down here,

05:58.183 --> 06:00.447
and I get her book.
And I have to get down

06:00.490 --> 06:02.100
on my knee
to get the book.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.798
And I get it,
and I hand it to her,

06:03.841 --> 06:06.322
and she says, "Thank you."

06:06.366 --> 06:07.671
And then I held out
my hand like this,

06:07.715 --> 06:09.369
- and I said...
- Help me up.

06:09.412 --> 06:10.935
- Are you gonna help me up?
- Oh, I thought you were

06:10.979 --> 06:12.589
- gonna propose.
- Just, are you gonna

06:12.633 --> 06:14.678
help me up? And she says,
"That's your problem."

06:14.722 --> 06:16.767
Oh! She... Okay!

06:16.811 --> 06:19.161
And it started to rain.

06:19.204 --> 06:23.165
And she knew that she probably
should seek shelter.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.428
- Yeah.
- But she didn't wanna leave.

06:25.472 --> 06:26.647
The forest was just
so beautiful in the rain.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.692
- Yeah.
- And then she...

06:28.736 --> 06:31.216
hunkered down under a...

06:31.260 --> 06:32.783
the trunk of a tree
that had fallen.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.959
And underneath the tree...

06:35.003 --> 06:36.744
underneath,
in that little hollow,

06:36.787 --> 06:39.442
I saw the moss growing.

06:39.486 --> 06:40.922
[woman] Wow...

06:43.185 --> 06:45.361
[man] Okay,
thank you, okay.

06:48.538 --> 06:51.759
- Hello there, Matthew.
- No, no, no...

06:51.802 --> 06:53.456
Sneaking behind the desk where
I'm never ever supposed to go.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.197
Oh, my goodness-- oh.

06:55.240 --> 06:59.419
"Why do I remember you
as a singing bird?

06:59.462 --> 07:01.682
[laughter]

07:01.725 --> 07:03.945
"My heart is warm
with the friends I make.

07:03.988 --> 07:06.687
And better friends
I'll not be knowing.

07:06.730 --> 07:09.124
But there isn't a train
I wouldn't take.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.039
No matter where it's going."

07:13.215 --> 07:15.565
"Travel,"
by Edna St. Vincent Millay.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.484
I should be able to do
better than this.

07:21.528 --> 07:24.139
I should be able to...
let's say switch,

07:24.182 --> 07:28.186
um, the Coates
and the Zadie Smith.

07:28.230 --> 07:30.101
Although, I don't want
that green one over here

07:30.145 --> 07:31.886
because there's
a green one over here.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.627
So I'll move this green one
over here a little bit,

07:33.670 --> 07:34.889
just like so.

07:36.368 --> 07:38.893
And everything is better.

07:38.936 --> 07:42.331
"Topeka School" is larger,
and I don't-- I want

07:42.374 --> 07:44.376
only small books
in the front here.

07:44.420 --> 07:48.206
So, like
the Edna O'Brien maybe.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.992
But what you lose there is
that it's not face out

07:51.035 --> 07:53.777
as soon as you walk in.
Here's the Crowley.

07:53.821 --> 07:56.258
I'll put the Crowley over here.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.826
Because I can tell people
about the Crowley.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.523
Oh, this came in
today, oh, good.

08:00.567 --> 08:03.613
And we got the
"Charlie the... Tramp."

08:03.657 --> 08:04.875
And "Harvey's Hideout."

08:07.878 --> 08:09.489
So, would you--
will you call her

08:09.532 --> 08:11.229
and tell her
we got this one in?

08:11.273 --> 08:12.579
- Yeah, absolutely.
- And does she know

08:12.622 --> 08:13.797
that there's
a new one coming also?

08:13.841 --> 08:15.233
Yes.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.237
First American publication.

08:19.281 --> 08:20.761
A young woman.
A married man.

08:20.804 --> 08:23.503
A searing love story.
A masterpiece.

08:23.546 --> 08:26.984
"By Grand Central Station,
I sat down and wept."

08:27.028 --> 08:29.291
I found a copy of this book
in a secondhand store

08:29.334 --> 08:31.032
in Tangiers.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.599
It looked terrific,
but I didn't buy it.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.252
I found another
secondhand copy

08:34.296 --> 08:37.647
in... a bookshop in Paris

08:37.691 --> 08:40.128
when I was traveling
in Africa and Europe.

08:40.171 --> 08:42.304
And, uh, didn't buy it.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.349
And always regretted not
having bought it.

08:44.393 --> 08:47.701
And finally when I bought
The Bookstore in 1976,

08:47.744 --> 08:49.833
this edition was available.

08:49.877 --> 08:53.489
It's a used bookstore
with new books.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.709
That is, the value
of an older book

08:55.752 --> 08:59.582
is... still appreciated.

08:59.626 --> 09:02.019
After college,
when I was in the Navy,

09:02.063 --> 09:04.848
is when I met a guy.

09:04.892 --> 09:08.765
And he turned me on
to Henry Miller.

09:08.809 --> 09:12.769
Yeah, Miller.
Mailer. Kerouac.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.597
Fred Exley.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.643
And I fell in love
with writing.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.471
That's what happened.
I fell in love with writing.

09:19.515 --> 09:20.951
So I understood somehow

09:20.995 --> 09:24.999
that this world of books

09:25.042 --> 09:27.349
was...

09:29.177 --> 09:33.355
fascinating,
it was... just...

09:33.398 --> 09:36.619
it was completely
different from my life.

09:36.663 --> 09:39.753
The world of the stories
that I found in books

09:39.796 --> 09:43.583
was so far away from mine,
it was like,

09:43.626 --> 09:46.847
[whispering]
nobody else knew.

09:46.890 --> 09:50.894
I was the only one who knew
what these stories were.

09:59.729 --> 10:01.513
Let me know if we can help
with anything.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.256
The town has changed.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.781
It is. I mean,
it changes all the time.

10:07.824 --> 10:11.306
I think the social aspect
of it has... weakened.

10:11.349 --> 10:13.438
I miss a lot of the old people.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.745
Like Tony Bar Tony would have
one cast of characters.

10:15.789 --> 10:18.052
You would have your...

10:18.095 --> 10:19.967
- Crowd, yeah.
- ...more of the literary type.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.099
There were a lot
of characters in our town.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.101
"'Well,' said Grandfather,

10:24.145 --> 10:25.886
'Charlie's getting to be
a big boy.'

10:25.929 --> 10:29.280
'Yes.' Grandfather took
a quarter out of his pocket.

10:29.324 --> 10:31.935
'What are you gonna be when
you grow up?' said Grandfather.

10:31.979 --> 10:34.372
'I'm going to be a tramp.'

10:34.416 --> 10:36.592
Grandfather put the quarter
back into his pocket."

10:36.636 --> 10:38.638
[laughing]

10:38.681 --> 10:41.728
- I want to be a tramp.
- You would love this book.

10:41.771 --> 10:44.513
- Are you a secret agent?
- A what?

10:44.556 --> 10:46.950
A secret agent.
No, he is.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.343
- He is.
- Okay.

10:48.386 --> 10:50.737
- No comment.
- [laughter]

10:50.780 --> 10:52.434
Together, we'll take
good pictures,

10:52.477 --> 10:53.870
and we'll get them
published.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.959
But we gotta come up
with a... pen name.

10:56.003 --> 10:58.745
You know, a new name
for the both of our work.

10:58.788 --> 11:01.225
And the name they came up with
was Robert Capa.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.489
So Gerda Taro

11:04.533 --> 11:07.014
and André Friedman were
Robert Capa.

11:07.057 --> 11:08.276
Huh.

11:10.191 --> 11:11.975
You know Russell Hoban
because he wrote

11:12.019 --> 11:13.411
all of the "Bread
and Jam for Frances."

11:13.455 --> 11:14.804
Oh yeah, totally.

11:24.466 --> 11:26.642
Hi.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.645
So, you know, this is...
a book about sibling rivalry.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.907
Oh, perfect.

11:30.951 --> 11:33.736
She comes to her...

11:33.780 --> 11:36.086
to her memory
through literature.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.653
Through the poems.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.742
Through poets.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.744
Through the filter
of the life

11:41.788 --> 11:43.659
- that she lives.
- Okay, okay.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.095
You wanna know how it ends?

11:45.139 --> 11:47.576
[laughing]

11:47.619 --> 11:48.925
I'll just go
with this one, I guess.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.361
- Okay. Great.
- Just get that.

11:55.018 --> 11:57.107
[whistling]

11:57.151 --> 11:59.066
- Hello.
- Well, good afternoon.

11:59.109 --> 12:00.763
Is it afternoon?

12:00.807 --> 12:02.460
- How are you?
- I don't recognize you.

12:02.504 --> 12:05.550
You've got so many mittens
and... scarves and...

12:05.594 --> 12:07.814
- [laughter]
- It's cold.

12:07.857 --> 12:10.381
You're free to the air.
How are you?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.257
[woman] Something
that has been weighing

12:16.300 --> 12:19.216
on my moral conscience is
the number of books

12:19.260 --> 12:22.785
that I order through Amazon
for convenience sake.

12:22.829 --> 12:25.135
And it has occurred to me--
I know, I know.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.224
I said it.
I said it out loud.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.531
It has occurred to me that
not only is this, like,

12:29.574 --> 12:32.273
an environmental catastrophe,

12:32.316 --> 12:34.492
but that, you know,

12:34.536 --> 12:37.191
I could do better in terms
of supporting bookstores.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.193
And I was wondering,
I don't want to be

12:39.236 --> 12:41.673
a pain in the neck either,
but I was wondering

12:41.717 --> 12:44.241
if I let you know
in advance

12:44.285 --> 12:46.678
the books that I need,
could I procure them

12:46.722 --> 12:48.071
- from you?
- Absolutely.

12:48.115 --> 12:50.421
So you're deep...
into "Harry Potter"?

12:50.465 --> 12:52.423
Deep.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.991
I think I... have
a gift for you.

12:55.035 --> 12:57.211
We missed
the "Harry Potter" Halloween.

12:57.254 --> 12:59.909
Can I... find
something for you

12:59.953 --> 13:02.782
- from that event?
- [laughing]

13:02.825 --> 13:05.001
- Is it a magic wand?
- Uh-huh.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.485
[soft guitar]

13:28.764 --> 13:30.766
I couldn't button
my pants today.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.986
[laughing]

13:33.029 --> 13:34.901
So, do you have to go out
and buy all these new clothes?

13:34.944 --> 13:36.772
Not yet.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.556
I'm just gonna put
tank tops over.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.125
This is...

13:42.169 --> 13:43.605
Speaking of
"nourishing the new mother."

13:44.911 --> 13:46.477
Are you--
so you're eating more?

13:46.521 --> 13:48.740
- Yeah.
- Wow.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.049
- Is this your fork?
- It is.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.051
- I'm sorry it's not washed.
- It's fine.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.966
- [laughing]
- I was missing it.

13:59.273 --> 14:00.883
- You want a bag?
- No.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.450
- Okay.
- All right.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.321
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right, so,

14:04.365 --> 14:05.801
what's happening is,
so you'll come in tomorrow

14:05.845 --> 14:07.803
and help me out
a little bit-- Sunday,

14:07.847 --> 14:09.761
since I haven't had
a day off in a while,

14:09.805 --> 14:11.546
I'm taking the day off.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.156
- Yeah.
- Cool, all right.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.897
- You go home.
- Okay.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.551
- Say hi to Michael.
- I will. Love you.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.161
Love you too.

14:22.209 --> 14:24.167
"At seven,
I was a soldier.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.734
At nine, a prince.

14:25.777 --> 14:27.214
But now, I'm mostly
at the window

14:27.257 --> 14:28.955
watching
the late afternoon light.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.826
Back then,
it never fell so solemnly

14:30.870 --> 14:32.784
against the side
of my treehouse.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.351
It seems only yesterday,

14:34.395 --> 14:35.918
I used to believe
there was nothing

14:35.962 --> 14:38.747
underneath my skin
but light.

14:38.790 --> 14:41.619
If you cut me,
I could shine."

14:44.622 --> 14:49.889
But it was... after
Sheila died that I was...

14:49.932 --> 14:52.413
that whatever it was
that happened to me

14:52.456 --> 14:57.113
as the survivor,
as the spouse, as the...

14:57.157 --> 14:59.246
whatever guilt you have
as a survivor.

14:59.289 --> 15:02.814
You know, whatever things
you want to do, raising--

15:02.858 --> 15:05.687
realizing that
I'm raising this family,

15:05.730 --> 15:07.297
these children...

15:07.341 --> 15:09.212
just like I was raised
by a single parent

15:09.256 --> 15:11.649
after my--
after I was orphaned.

15:11.693 --> 15:14.261
So I understood
that my kids were orphaned.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.176
They had me,
but they were orphaned.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.482
And... it was just
a combination

15:18.526 --> 15:21.833
of that knowledge,
and that wisdom, and that...

15:21.877 --> 15:25.620
visceral sense of the...

15:25.663 --> 15:27.535
of our lifespan.

15:27.578 --> 15:30.625
[somber piano]

15:43.072 --> 15:44.552
Actually, can we get a bag?

15:44.595 --> 15:46.815
- Of course.
- [chatter]

15:46.858 --> 15:48.121
I'll give you
some bookmarks.

15:48.164 --> 15:49.731
Awesome, thank you.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.300
I don't think people
should ask you

15:53.343 --> 15:56.477
- if you're gonna have kids.
- [laughing]

15:56.520 --> 15:59.523
It's such an intensely
personal question and topic.

16:01.569 --> 16:02.962
Yeah.

16:05.877 --> 16:07.270
The doctor was like...

16:07.314 --> 16:09.490
she couldn't find
the heartbeat at first.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.057
And then she was like,
"Wait-- is it that low?"

16:11.100 --> 16:12.797
She was like, "Oh, my God,
you poor thing.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.190
It's still
sitting this low?

16:14.234 --> 16:15.757
Are you peeing
all the time?"

16:15.800 --> 16:17.237
Whatever.

16:20.283 --> 16:22.111
So, yes, I am.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.071
"A man was
cleaning the attic

16:25.114 --> 16:26.550
of an old house
in New England,

16:26.594 --> 16:27.943
and he found a box
which was full

16:27.987 --> 16:30.076
of tiny pieces of string.

16:30.119 --> 16:31.773
On the lid of the box,
there was

16:31.816 --> 16:33.644
an inscription
in an old hand:

16:33.688 --> 16:36.343
'string too short
to be saved.'"

Daily Alice dreamed
that she stood

17:02.978 --> 17:04.719
in a flower starred field,

17:04.762 --> 17:06.503
where on a hill
there grew an oak tree

17:06.547 --> 17:08.331
and a thorn in deep embrace,

17:08.375 --> 17:11.378
their branches
intertwined like fingers.

17:11.421 --> 17:13.075
Far down the hall,
Sophie dreamed there was

17:13.119 --> 17:14.859
a tiny door in her elbow,

17:14.903 --> 17:17.079
open a crack,
through which the wind blew,

blowing on her heart."

he sat before his typewriter

'There is an aged,
aged insect

17:25.566 --> 17:27.350
who lives
in a hole in the ground.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.657
One June, he puts on
his summer straw

17:29.700 --> 17:31.789
and takes his pipe and staff

17:31.833 --> 17:33.791
and his lamp
in half his hands,

17:33.835 --> 17:35.489
and follows
the worm in the root

17:35.532 --> 17:37.491
to the stair
that leads up to the door

17:37.534 --> 17:39.884
into blue summer.'

17:39.928 --> 17:42.626
This seemed immensely
significant to him,

17:42.670 --> 17:44.585
but when he awoke,
he wouldn't be able

17:44.628 --> 17:47.849
to remember a word of it,
try hard as he might.

17:47.892 --> 17:50.025
Mother beside him dreamed
her husband wasn't

17:50.069 --> 17:52.941
in his study at all,
but with her in the kitchen,

17:52.984 --> 17:54.638
where she drew
tin cookie sheets

17:54.682 --> 17:56.684
endlessly out of the oven.

17:56.727 --> 17:59.991
The baked things on them
were brown and round,

18:00.035 --> 18:01.819
and when he asked her
what they were,

18:01.863 --> 18:04.126
she said, 'Years.'"

back up a little bit,

on that stool right there.

any Elizabeth Taylor in there?

Elizabeth Taylor?
Maybe.

Am I on the phone? No...

Nope.
No Elizabeth Taylor.

- Hi.

No, I don't have
anything in stock.

Can I get something for you?

No, I didn't realize
we couldn't browse.

- Yeah, sorry.
- Judy.

"Girl, Woman, Other."

- I just called you.
- Judy, okay, hold on.

20:11.427 --> 20:14.082
Do you want me to get you
a copy of the Jane Austen?

20:14.125 --> 20:15.431
No, because
I won't be here.

Four digits.

The billing zip code.

Okay, Judy,
I'm gonna ask you

21:08.223 --> 21:11.313
to step on the sidewalk
while I put it on the stool.

dance with each other.

- Okay, thank you.

a bag for that?

- Thank you.

- Yes.

Hi.

legal pads.

The yellow pad.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.247
Yep, 8 1/2 by 11?

21:32.291 --> 21:33.857
- Yeah.
- Or long...

- No, yeah.
- Eight and a half by 11.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.600
Like three of them.
Thank you.

21:41.604 --> 21:44.825
You know, if I stop
to think about...

21:44.868 --> 21:48.959
uh... finances...

21:52.833 --> 21:56.184
or the future,
when we're not gonna

21:56.227 --> 21:58.186
want to have the door open,
when it's gonna--

21:58.229 --> 22:00.884
when it's gonna be dark
at 4:00 in the afternoon,

22:00.928 --> 22:03.757
I... my mind stops.

22:05.411 --> 22:08.588
I can't, um...
can't imagine.

22:15.377 --> 22:18.380
[soft guitar]

22:28.999 --> 22:31.611
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:31.654 --> 22:33.395
Give me a... mystery,

22:33.439 --> 22:35.354
some light reading
for the summer.

22:35.397 --> 22:38.444
Even in a paperback,
that's okay with me.

22:38.487 --> 22:40.097
How about you?

22:40.141 --> 22:42.404
Uh, I came up
with my books, thank you.

22:42.448 --> 22:43.797
- Oh!
- I did.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.494
A lot you care about me.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.322
Actually, I do.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.280
[man] Something,
I don't care if it was

22:49.324 --> 22:51.195
on the bestseller list.
Something you like.

22:54.590 --> 22:55.896
Let's see.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.597
Let's see.
What can we get this guy?

23:03.947 --> 23:05.645
"The Black-Eyed Blonde."

23:05.688 --> 23:07.473
Oh, I think
I used to date her.

23:07.516 --> 23:08.909
Okay, how much?

23:10.693 --> 23:13.087
It's credit card only,
I'll tell you in a minute.

23:13.130 --> 23:14.741
- Credit card only.
- Credit card only.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.056
No, no, no, no.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.015
I need you
to read it to me.

23:30.017 --> 23:32.062
I'm taking my mask off,

23:32.106 --> 23:34.456
but the glass should be
good protection.

23:36.066 --> 23:39.069
[reciting digits]

23:40.157 --> 23:42.203
Get outta here.
Back up.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.987
[muffled chatter]

23:46.512 --> 23:48.296
Ah... no, no, no.

23:48.339 --> 23:50.472
I'm going to put it
on that stool over there.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.213
- And Norman?
- Yes.

23:52.256 --> 23:54.563
- I want you to tie your shoe.
- Good idea.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.435
Yeah, well,
I just stepped on a lace now.

23:56.478 --> 23:59.350
Matt, The Bookloft
in Great Barrington closed?

23:59.394 --> 24:01.091
- It closed?
- Yeah, oh, you didn't know?

24:01.135 --> 24:03.442
No, no, they moved.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.618
- Oh, where did they move to?
- They're on State Road.

24:10.492 --> 24:12.712
I'm on credit hold
with Simon & Schuster

24:12.755 --> 24:14.235
because I owe 'em
too much money.

24:14.278 --> 24:15.889
I don't have enough money
to pay 'em

24:15.932 --> 24:18.326
right now.

24:18.369 --> 24:21.198
Peter, this is Matt.
Peter, I just sent an order

24:21.242 --> 24:22.939
into Taylor
& Francis yesterday,

24:22.983 --> 24:25.115
but I have an old--
I have four old invoices

24:25.159 --> 24:27.248
that I wanted to pay.

24:27.291 --> 24:29.337
And I wanted
to make sure that...

24:29.380 --> 24:31.382
that you would let
the order go through.

24:31.426 --> 24:34.516
I'm going to send you
a check for...

24:34.560 --> 24:36.866
I have it right here
on the other desk.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.781
So, I'm up a tree?

24:38.825 --> 24:41.305
Do I... sacrifice everything

24:41.349 --> 24:45.222
and... pay
Simon & Schuster $3600

24:45.266 --> 24:48.225
so I can buy one book
for this person?

24:48.269 --> 24:49.923
I'm going to hold off on that.

24:49.966 --> 24:53.100
Just because I need
to pay other people too.

24:58.061 --> 25:00.237
"All the Colors."

25:00.281 --> 25:02.413
Two copies.
"All the Colors We Are."

25:02.457 --> 25:04.111
How-- whoa!

25:08.115 --> 25:12.293
"Union."
Two copies at $28.

25:12.336 --> 25:14.643
What is "Union?"
A democrat and republican

25:14.687 --> 25:16.297
search for common ground.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.387
[phone ringing]

25:19.430 --> 25:22.216
Hello, Bookstore.
There you are.

25:23.609 --> 25:27.438
It's... this all melds
into psychology.

25:30.746 --> 25:32.269
Or does it?

25:36.230 --> 25:38.275
Another one.

25:43.498 --> 25:44.891
"I am discontented.

25:44.934 --> 25:46.719
I want something
I do not have.

25:46.762 --> 25:49.199
There must be more to life
than having everything.

25:49.243 --> 25:51.201
In the middle of the night,
she packed everything

25:51.245 --> 25:53.029
into a black leather bag
with gold buckles

25:53.073 --> 25:54.596
and looked out
of her favorite window

25:54.640 --> 25:56.467
for the last time.
'You have everything,'

25:56.511 --> 25:57.730
said the potted plant
that happened to be

25:57.773 --> 25:59.340
looking out
of the same window.

25:59.383 --> 26:01.037
'If you do,'
said the small pig,

26:01.081 --> 26:03.431
'don't call us,
we'll call you.'

26:03.474 --> 26:05.215
And he vanished so quickly,
Jenny just had time

26:05.259 --> 26:07.304
to snatch the last sandwich.

26:07.348 --> 26:09.480
It was salami, her favorite."

26:11.352 --> 26:13.746
[soft guitar]

26:19.229 --> 26:22.319
I hope your day is
as awesome as you look.

26:22.363 --> 26:24.452
- Ah...
- [laughing]

26:24.495 --> 26:26.846
Then she said,
"Wait a minute. I got it."

26:26.889 --> 26:29.370
It's... a cross

26:29.413 --> 26:31.241
between Jimmy Buffett
and Willie Nelson.

26:31.285 --> 26:33.200
[laughing]

26:33.243 --> 26:35.463
- And there it is.
- There it is.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.465
I don't want
to turn your attention,

26:37.508 --> 26:39.641
but there's a beautiful woman
standing at the door.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.643
Ah, Tamara.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.123
- Okay, see you later.
- Tamara?

26:43.166 --> 26:44.864
I'll see you... Tamara.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.300
[laughing]

26:48.563 --> 26:50.521
One of the pleasures
of my life

26:50.565 --> 26:52.219
is to turn around
and see a woman

26:52.262 --> 26:54.177
hold something up
and have her put

26:54.221 --> 26:56.397
her thumb up and say yes.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.442
- [laughing]
- You know,

26:58.486 --> 27:01.141
- if this was my life?
- Yeah, simple pleasures.

27:01.184 --> 27:03.012
[laughing]

27:03.056 --> 27:04.623
"My heart being hungry
feeds on food,

27:04.666 --> 27:07.364
the fat of... heart despised.

27:07.408 --> 27:08.801
Beauty where
beauty never stood.

27:08.844 --> 27:10.367
And sweet
where no sweet lies.

27:10.411 --> 27:12.108
- I gather to my..."
- [phone ringing]

27:12.152 --> 27:14.154
"...querulous needs, having
a growing heart to feed."

27:16.373 --> 27:19.028
[phone ringing]

27:19.072 --> 27:20.508
Hello, Bookstore.

27:24.164 --> 27:26.645
Can't come in.
Can't come in.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.472
I'm not-- I'm not
letting browsers in.

27:28.516 --> 27:29.909
You can browse
through the window

27:29.952 --> 27:33.303
or on... the website
and choose a book.

27:33.347 --> 27:34.522
Or, if you know a book...

27:39.875 --> 27:41.834
Okay, Suzanne.
I will wrap up the other one

27:41.877 --> 27:43.618
and send it to Cheryl...

27:43.662 --> 27:45.185
- Perfect.
- ...tomorrow, it will go out

27:45.228 --> 27:46.621
maybe tomorrow
or the next day.

27:46.665 --> 27:47.578
- Okay, that's fine.
- Okay?

27:47.622 --> 27:48.928
That's fine, okay.

27:48.971 --> 27:50.364
So you know
what I always do?

27:50.407 --> 27:51.800
I go in...
because I park

27:51.844 --> 27:53.715
in the Loeb's
parking lot...

27:53.759 --> 27:55.195
You feel like you have
to go to Loeb's, right?

27:55.238 --> 27:56.805
So I bought coleslaw.
Would you like it?

27:56.849 --> 27:58.720
- Oh...
- There's a little container

27:58.764 --> 28:00.809
- of coleslaw for you.
- Oh... [laughing]

28:00.853 --> 28:02.768
So I go in there first
and come out.

28:02.811 --> 28:04.378
- You're sweet.
- Okay.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.640
- Thank you.
- So...

28:05.684 --> 28:07.120
So, should I take that?

28:07.163 --> 28:08.687
Because don't
I already have it?

28:08.730 --> 28:09.470
I'll run it through
right now.

28:09.513 --> 28:10.689
Yeah

28:13.213 --> 28:14.562
Suzanne.

28:24.354 --> 28:25.660
Sixteen-ninety-five...

28:25.704 --> 28:28.619
$17, okay.

28:28.663 --> 28:30.230
Oh, God, Matt.
If it ain't one thing,

28:30.273 --> 28:32.623
- it's another, huh?
- It's-- yeah, yeah.

28:32.667 --> 28:35.322
- Yeah.
- So, Saturday.

28:35.365 --> 28:37.019
Saturday, I was here.

28:37.063 --> 28:38.717
Eight customers, you said?

28:38.760 --> 28:40.544
Eight customers.
I told you already.

28:40.588 --> 28:41.807
- [laughing]
- Yeah.

28:41.850 --> 28:43.634
That's a record, isn't it?

28:43.678 --> 28:45.680
- For July, yeah.
- For July.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.508
You know, we had--
the total take of the day

28:47.551 --> 28:49.075
was approximately

28:49.118 --> 28:51.294
what one good customer
would have done.

28:51.338 --> 28:54.776
[laughing]

28:54.820 --> 28:56.778
- Ay-yi-yi.
- So, I assume

28:56.822 --> 28:58.519
that's for all
of the stores around?

28:58.562 --> 28:59.999
Well, I don't know.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.609
- Because I'm not open.
- Yeah.

29:01.652 --> 29:02.958
And I'm the only store
that's not open.

29:03.002 --> 29:04.438
- Really?
- I think everybody else

29:04.481 --> 29:05.482
is open.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.310
"I was entirely happy.

29:08.964 --> 29:11.924
Perhaps we feel like that
when we die...

29:11.967 --> 29:13.490
and become a part
of something entire.

29:13.534 --> 29:15.754
Whether it is
the sun and air,

29:15.797 --> 29:17.886
or goodness and knowledge.

29:17.930 --> 29:20.584
At any rate,
that is happiness.

29:20.628 --> 29:22.543
That is happiness.
To be dissolved

29:22.586 --> 29:24.719
into something
complete and great."

29:25.938 --> 29:28.636
Carol's idea was--
is that-- is that

29:28.679 --> 29:30.594
you would be doing
the introductions,

29:30.638 --> 29:33.032
but I would
introduce the program.

29:33.075 --> 29:34.860
I mean, I would introduce:

29:34.903 --> 29:36.949
"Here's what we have,
and now here's Colin,

29:36.992 --> 29:39.038
who's gonna introduce
Sarah Chase."

29:39.081 --> 29:40.691
- Yes.
- Something like that.

29:40.735 --> 29:42.258
Does Carol know
how to do this?

29:42.302 --> 29:43.956
- Carol knows how to do this.
- Well, then,

29:43.999 --> 29:45.784
she can show me
how to do it, right?

29:45.827 --> 29:47.524
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...
- Okay, if somebody shows me,

29:47.568 --> 29:49.222
it's probably
quite simple, right?

29:49.265 --> 29:53.008
So, um... so...
then what you can do.

29:53.052 --> 29:54.705
One of the first steps
for you to do,

29:54.749 --> 29:57.230
is to get back in touch
with all of our authors

29:57.273 --> 30:00.799
that we... postponed
all this... past year,

30:00.842 --> 30:03.018
and say,
"Would you be interested

30:03.062 --> 30:06.326
in-- in doing
a Zoom talk?"

30:06.369 --> 30:07.849
There's a thing
in the light of this.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.633
Yeah.

30:09.677 --> 30:11.113
All right,
I got it now, yeah.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.854
So put that in.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.769
So, where is this?
Where am I right now?

30:14.813 --> 30:16.771
What is that thing
that you just put a name in?

30:16.815 --> 30:19.034
This is...
the Bookshop...

30:19.078 --> 30:21.297
- Zoom?
- No, this is Bookshop.org.

30:21.341 --> 30:23.082
- All right.
- So this is Bookshop.org.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.562
I just need
to have somebody...

30:25.606 --> 30:27.826
I don't know anything
about the technology.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.218
- Right, right.
- I absolutely need somebody

30:29.262 --> 30:31.264
who's, like,
done it before

30:31.307 --> 30:34.267
and at least knows everything
about how to do it.

30:34.310 --> 30:35.921
And as long as
I'm instructed on it...

30:35.964 --> 30:37.792
- Right, yeah.
- ...I'll do it.

30:39.968 --> 30:42.144
- Thank you, man.
- Okay, see you later.

30:46.627 --> 30:48.368
Hello, Bookstore.

30:48.411 --> 30:50.761
On a blind date,
I was driving to her house.

30:50.805 --> 30:52.546
And I was reading...

30:52.589 --> 30:56.028
I was listening
to Siobhán McKenna

30:56.071 --> 30:58.987
recite Molly's...
Molly Bloom's soliloquy

30:59.031 --> 31:01.598
from James Joyce's "Ulysses."

31:01.642 --> 31:04.601
And I got almost
to the woman's house,

31:04.645 --> 31:07.082
and I wasn't quite finished
with Molly Bloom.

31:07.126 --> 31:10.303
And I thought,
Molly Bloom is

31:10.346 --> 31:12.653
much better than
this date is going to be.

31:12.696 --> 31:14.698
[laughing]

31:14.742 --> 31:17.310
"Brown Girl Dreaming,"
we should always have.

31:17.353 --> 31:19.355
"The Underground Railroad,"
we have.

31:19.399 --> 31:20.922
"The Rules of Civility,"
we have one,

31:20.966 --> 31:22.010
we should get
another one of that.

31:23.664 --> 31:25.187
And it says the came in?

31:25.231 --> 31:27.755
Do you have...
the invoice information?

31:27.798 --> 31:31.237
Isn't there some way to just
download all of your invoices?

31:31.280 --> 31:33.630
There is conceivably
a much better way

31:33.674 --> 31:35.241
to run a business

31:35.284 --> 31:37.417
than the way I do.
[laughing]

31:37.460 --> 31:39.636
That's not necessarily
what I was suggesting.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.247
No, I understand.

31:41.290 --> 31:43.162
Isn't there
a better way to...

31:43.205 --> 31:46.556
[laughing]
...to do what you're doing?

31:46.600 --> 31:48.297
You know, who is a bookseller?

31:49.995 --> 31:52.345
I'm not an antiquarian
bookseller.

31:52.388 --> 31:55.478
I am not...
an independent bookseller.

31:55.522 --> 31:57.437
I'm not, like,
an independent--

31:57.480 --> 32:00.135
like-- like the independent
bookstores that you see.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.616
And this independent
bookstore is doing well,

32:02.659 --> 32:04.270
and they have...

32:07.012 --> 32:08.839
watered-down inventory.

32:08.883 --> 32:11.451
And it's... a community...

32:11.494 --> 32:12.887
thank you...

32:15.020 --> 32:17.196
notecards and--
and coffee...

32:17.239 --> 32:18.980
or you know...
and I...

32:19.024 --> 32:20.503
I'm just some sort of hybrid

32:20.547 --> 32:23.506
that I don't--
I don't know that

32:23.550 --> 32:26.466
because I am not
a businessman.

32:26.509 --> 32:29.512
Because I was...

32:29.556 --> 32:32.385
I've always been doing it
by-- by the seat of my pants,

32:32.428 --> 32:34.126
that, um...

32:37.738 --> 32:41.002
so I'm-- I'm like
the old guy...

32:41.046 --> 32:43.004
the old guy
shuffling along.

32:43.048 --> 32:46.573
"Oh, I have
this Schopenhauer for you.

32:46.616 --> 32:49.576
I've been waiting 12 years
for you to walk in."

32:49.619 --> 32:52.753
Uh, I'm... half that guy

32:52.796 --> 32:54.450
and, um...

32:55.843 --> 32:58.280
um...

32:58.324 --> 33:00.500
and half a contemporary
bookseller.

33:00.543 --> 33:02.893
- People might like that.
- All right.

33:02.937 --> 33:04.852
Oh, whoops.
Not anymore.

33:08.377 --> 33:12.816
William Shirer's...
"Berlin Diaries."

33:12.860 --> 33:14.166
Oh, wow.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.605
Inscribed to his wife.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.523
"To Tess. Endlich.

33:23.566 --> 33:25.568
off..." something--
I can't read the German.

33:25.612 --> 33:27.483
"It brings back
our golden days.

33:27.527 --> 33:30.138
Love, Bill.
December, 1951."

33:30.182 --> 33:32.662
Wow, you have
a bunch of...

33:32.706 --> 33:34.577
of German books by...

33:36.840 --> 33:38.407
Anais Nin.

33:38.451 --> 33:40.496
- Anais Nin, yeah.
- Anais Nin.

33:40.540 --> 33:43.499
Yeah, I got those
from her agent.

33:43.543 --> 33:44.761
Oh, yeah?

33:45.980 --> 33:47.851
- Yeah.
- Whoops.

33:47.895 --> 33:49.766
Um, sorry about all that.

33:49.810 --> 33:54.075
So-- So here are
a lot of the... psychology.

33:54.119 --> 33:56.251
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and these I got,

33:56.295 --> 33:58.079
"The Psychoanalytical Studies
of a Child."

33:58.123 --> 34:00.299
I got these from somebody
who must have been so...

34:00.342 --> 34:02.127
cackling to himself.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.519
Why would I want
to buy these shit--

34:03.563 --> 34:05.304
And I thought they were cool.

34:05.347 --> 34:06.914
And I've never even
put them out for sale.

34:08.394 --> 34:10.526
I just-- I just was
buying, buying, buying.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.789
Here's "The Summer Game"
by Roger Angell.

34:14.356 --> 34:16.228
A guy named Charles McCarry.

34:16.271 --> 34:18.012
- Espionage.
- Oh, okay.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.362
He wrote
these espionage novels.

34:20.406 --> 34:22.060
Just terrific.
They're just terrific.

34:22.103 --> 34:23.626
I have a dream.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.585
That I'm reading a review

34:25.628 --> 34:27.804
of McCarry's new book.

34:27.848 --> 34:31.112
So I wake up in the morning,
and I write him a letter.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.896
I don't hear anything.

34:32.940 --> 34:35.247
Six months later,
I get a postcard.

34:35.290 --> 34:37.466
Typed.

34:37.510 --> 34:41.122
"Dear Mr. Tannenbaum,
I never complain

34:41.166 --> 34:43.124
when a bookseller
dreams of my work."

34:43.168 --> 34:44.908
These are some
of my favorite books.

34:44.952 --> 34:48.216
- "Lucky Bastard."
- And page 71.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.479
- Got it, page 71.
- Good.

34:50.523 --> 34:53.308
- Have you read John Fowles?
- No.

34:55.745 --> 34:58.096
"The Collector"
and, uh, "The Magus."

34:58.139 --> 34:59.923
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.708
"The Magus," especially.

35:01.751 --> 35:03.188
All right,
want a bag for that?

35:03.231 --> 35:04.928
Um, no, I think we're good.

35:04.972 --> 35:06.321
You're good.
Thank you, okay.

35:10.543 --> 35:14.503
Uh-uh-uh-uh, oh, no--
I blew it. I blew it.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.070
- [woman] I'm sorry, what?
- [Matt] Four?

35:16.114 --> 35:19.160
Oh, it's 4179...

35:19.204 --> 35:22.207
Come on, 4179...
there we are.

35:22.250 --> 35:25.427
On a good day in the summer,
that would be my day.

35:27.299 --> 35:29.039
This is my week.

35:29.083 --> 35:31.433
Are the bookshops open
in the city?

35:31.477 --> 35:33.305
- [man] Hello, Bookstore.
- [woman] They just reopened,

35:33.348 --> 35:35.307
- I would say...
- This is.

35:35.350 --> 35:37.091
...a couple of weeks...

35:37.135 --> 35:38.919
- Uh-huh.
- Very recently they opened.

35:38.962 --> 35:41.008
- Are you in Manhattan?
- Yeah, Upper West.

35:41.051 --> 35:43.358
Upper West.
So, Book Culture...

35:43.402 --> 35:44.838
They closed,
they closed...

35:44.881 --> 35:46.622
I-- They're open, right?

35:46.666 --> 35:48.755
No, they shut--
the store shut.

35:48.798 --> 35:50.583
[overlapping chatter]

35:50.626 --> 35:53.238
...there was a dispute...
between the two partners.

35:53.281 --> 35:55.065
- It was my favorite bookstore.
- No kidding.

35:55.109 --> 35:57.198
Yes, and the Strand
just opened

35:57.242 --> 35:59.069
an outpost
in that location.

35:59.113 --> 36:01.071
- Oh, boy...
- Yeah.

36:01.115 --> 36:03.335
Phew-- you ever go
to Three Lives?

36:03.378 --> 36:04.945
- Of course!
- Okay.

36:04.988 --> 36:07.165
When I went to law school
that's where I would go.

36:07.208 --> 36:09.732
Right, yeah... that's just
the best bookstore in the city.

36:09.776 --> 36:12.039
- It is. It absolutely is.
- You know...

36:12.082 --> 36:14.520
you didn't know
the Gotham Book Mart, did you?

36:14.563 --> 36:16.174
- I didn't.
- Okay, I used to work there

36:16.217 --> 36:17.697
back in the '70s.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.568
- Okay.
- So that was, you know...

36:19.612 --> 36:21.918
a highlight.
That was a great old bookstore.

36:23.572 --> 36:26.053
[soft guitar]

36:34.888 --> 36:37.107
"First light.
I was set down

36:37.151 --> 36:39.980
from the carrier's cart
at the age of three.

36:40.023 --> 36:42.200
And there, with a sense
of bewilderment and terror,

36:42.243 --> 36:43.766
my life in the village began."

36:45.072 --> 36:47.030
You know, the reason I got
to the Gotham Book Mart

36:47.074 --> 36:49.163
was because of Anais Nin.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.252
Somebody said,
"If you like Henry Miller--"

36:51.296 --> 36:53.254
a friend of mine said,

36:53.298 --> 36:55.125
"If you like Henry Miller,
you should read

36:55.169 --> 36:56.388
his friend,
Lawrence Durell.

36:56.431 --> 36:57.998
And their friend, Anais Nin.

36:58.041 --> 36:59.565
And the only place
that has them

36:59.608 --> 37:01.567
in the country is
the Gotham Book Mart."

37:01.610 --> 37:02.959
So I walked
into the Gotham Book Mart.

37:03.003 --> 37:04.831
I was not a bookseller.
I was just fresh

37:04.874 --> 37:07.790
out of the United States Navy,

37:07.834 --> 37:12.012
um, and looking
for direction in my life.

37:12.055 --> 37:14.057
And so I walked
into the Gotham Book Mart.

37:14.101 --> 37:17.713
And I think it was
the smell of the wooden floor.

37:17.757 --> 37:20.934
And the smell of the books...

37:20.977 --> 37:23.589
um, that just--
that just-- hi.

37:23.632 --> 37:26.156
That just did me in.
Welcome.

37:28.768 --> 37:31.727
When I think
of the Gotham...

37:31.771 --> 37:34.774
I think that's how it was a...

37:34.817 --> 37:37.646
among all the other things
that it is and was,

37:37.690 --> 37:41.302
it was a, um...

37:41.346 --> 37:46.873
the last of...
the old-time bookstores.

37:46.916 --> 37:49.354
The Gotham Book Mart was
started by Frances Steloff.

37:49.397 --> 37:51.573
A woman in...

37:51.617 --> 37:54.837
she opened it
on January 1st, 1920.

37:54.881 --> 37:57.971
And she... had been
working in books

37:58.014 --> 37:59.538
and department stores
before that.

37:59.581 --> 38:01.844
She was an orphan girl
from Saratoga

38:01.888 --> 38:03.629
and had made her way
to New York.

38:03.672 --> 38:05.892
And now in the late '60s,

38:05.935 --> 38:07.589
early '70s,
by the time I got there,

38:07.633 --> 38:09.374
she was the most famous
bookseller in America.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.289
And she had sold her shop,

38:11.332 --> 38:12.551
but she-- but she still
owned the building.

38:12.594 --> 38:14.248
And she lived upstairs.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.076
And she still came
into work every day.

38:16.119 --> 38:19.471
And I would sit
literally at her knee.

38:19.514 --> 38:21.299
She had a little alcove.

38:21.342 --> 38:24.693
And... so outside was
all of this literature.

38:24.737 --> 38:26.478
Fiction.
All this poetry.

38:26.521 --> 38:28.610
Great poetry.
Film. Theater.

38:28.654 --> 38:30.743
Great stuff, 'cause,
the reason she started

38:30.786 --> 38:33.528
on 52nd Street was...
it was the theater district.

38:33.572 --> 38:36.966
Martha Graham used to come in
and hold her finger,

38:37.010 --> 38:39.229
so Frances could tie
the bow on a gift,

38:39.273 --> 38:41.362
on, you know, a book
that they were gift-wrapping

38:41.406 --> 38:44.060
like... the early,
you know, Christmas days.

38:44.104 --> 38:47.063
Anyway, Frances is, like,
this famous person.

38:47.107 --> 38:48.717
And-- but she didn't
read books.

38:50.110 --> 38:51.633
She had her finger
on the pulse,

38:51.677 --> 38:54.244
but she didn't read books,
and her alcove,

38:54.288 --> 38:56.812
which was probably about
the size of this area here,

38:56.856 --> 38:58.771
where it was
just all the...

38:58.814 --> 39:02.296
um, philosophy
and religion books.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.255
And she was greatly interested
in Eastern religion.

39:05.299 --> 39:07.780
So this was the '60s,
this was the early '70s.

39:07.823 --> 39:09.216
And I'm, like,
the hippie on the staff.

39:09.259 --> 39:12.132
Right? I got...
glazy eyes and, um...

39:12.175 --> 39:17.050
I handled the stock.
So I really learned,

39:17.093 --> 39:19.531
like a young child...

39:19.574 --> 39:23.883
learns through
his or her limbs,

39:23.926 --> 39:25.711
I learned my trade viscerally.

39:27.539 --> 39:29.932
And the shelves in the back

39:29.976 --> 39:34.284
were so deep that
books were double-shelved.

39:34.328 --> 39:36.852
I had to really get
the alphabet down.

39:36.896 --> 39:38.854
You know, somewhere between,

39:38.898 --> 39:44.251
after G-H-I-J-K-M-Mc-Mac...

39:44.294 --> 39:47.646
um, it got confusing to a--
to a young stoner.

39:47.689 --> 39:50.083
I had to deliver
a manuscript

39:50.126 --> 39:52.564
to the people at Scribner's.

39:52.607 --> 39:57.090
And I walked up those stairs
to the Scribner's publishers,

39:57.133 --> 40:00.441
thinking, you know, Fitzgerald
walked up these stairs.

40:00.485 --> 40:03.183
Hemingway walked up
these stairs.

40:03.226 --> 40:05.751
One of my later
favorite writers,

40:05.794 --> 40:07.927
Marjorie Rawlings,
walked up these stairs.

40:07.970 --> 40:09.668
Thomas Wolfe walked up
these stairs.

40:09.711 --> 40:11.931
Edith Wharton, eh...

40:11.974 --> 40:13.585
she probably sat
outside in the car,

40:13.628 --> 40:16.109
and her chauffeur walked up
the stairs.

40:16.152 --> 40:17.850
I don't know...
that's what I want to think.

40:22.855 --> 40:25.074
[soft guitar]

40:27.337 --> 40:29.688
Look at the smile on that guy's
face, he found a book.

40:34.562 --> 40:36.216
First page.

40:39.524 --> 40:43.092
It's as if someone had
discovered a new manuscript

40:43.136 --> 40:47.401
- by the fourth Bronte.
- Mmm.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.447
- Sophie got mad at me.
- Sophie got mad at you?

40:49.490 --> 40:51.144
She was like, "Stop telling
people you're grumpy."

40:51.187 --> 40:53.363
- I'm like, "Well, I am!"
- [laughing]

40:53.407 --> 40:55.888
They keep asking how I am,
I'm grumpy or cranky.

40:55.931 --> 40:58.325
- Cranky.
- Yeah, grumpy,

40:58.368 --> 41:00.893
cranky, this is--
this is, like,

41:00.936 --> 41:03.199
uh, standard
operating procedure.

41:03.243 --> 41:05.201
- I know.
- I'm thinking,

41:05.245 --> 41:07.073
we should get
some of Alice's stuff up.

41:07.116 --> 41:09.379
That we still have.

41:09.423 --> 41:11.817
Um, Alice Brock.
From "Alice's Restaurant."

41:11.860 --> 41:14.167
Alice had--
had this small, little café.

41:14.210 --> 41:16.604
Like three tables
and a counter.

41:16.648 --> 41:18.519
This guy, David,
David Silverstein,

41:18.563 --> 41:21.653
was a guy from the Bronx
who had friends

41:21.696 --> 41:24.438
who... he had friends
who invited him up.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.962
They ran a café at the
Berkshire Theatre Festival.

41:28.311 --> 41:30.879
And Alice was hiring.

41:30.923 --> 41:33.665
And they became friends.

41:33.708 --> 41:35.318
He started The Bookstore.

41:35.362 --> 41:41.368
He, like Alice...
were not appreciated

41:41.411 --> 41:43.501
by the town fathers
of Stockbridge.

41:43.544 --> 41:45.851
Right? So Alice moved
up to Housatonic.

41:47.069 --> 41:49.071
And David moved to Lenox.

41:49.115 --> 41:52.031
And first he went
to a place on Franklin Street.

41:52.074 --> 41:54.860
And then he went to the corner
where Shots Café is now.

41:54.903 --> 41:56.601
- Okay.
- And then he came here.

41:56.644 --> 41:58.080
Around early '70s.

41:58.124 --> 42:00.169
'73, '74 or so.

42:00.213 --> 42:03.782
And then, in '76,
he sold it to me.

42:03.825 --> 42:08.438
I bought The Bookstore
ten days before I turned 30.

42:08.482 --> 42:10.266
And then--
and I've had it ever since.

42:11.746 --> 42:15.707
And-- but it started
with Alice.

42:15.750 --> 42:17.665
And Arlo.
We never see Arlo.

42:17.709 --> 42:20.538
So Arlo and Alice
got together

42:20.581 --> 42:23.149
for the first time
ever since those days,

42:23.192 --> 42:25.717
since... the days
of the record.

42:25.760 --> 42:29.547
When Alice had a book called,
"How to Massage Your Cat."

42:29.590 --> 42:31.679
- Do you have cats?
- No.

42:31.723 --> 42:33.594
Do you hate cats?

42:33.638 --> 42:36.597
Alice wrote a book called
"How to Massage Your Cat."

42:36.641 --> 42:38.468
And here's a poster

42:38.512 --> 42:41.776
that her dad made
from her illustrations.

42:41.820 --> 42:44.257
How did you just happen
to have that right there?

42:44.300 --> 42:45.998
[laughing]
This is so strange.

42:46.041 --> 42:47.565
Why did you just...

42:47.608 --> 42:49.523
what, did you know
I was going to come in,

42:49.567 --> 42:51.438
and you were gonna be
telling me this story today?

42:51.481 --> 42:53.048
This is...

42:53.092 --> 42:56.617
this is my little
play area right here.

42:56.661 --> 42:58.619
And these are my props.

42:58.663 --> 43:00.360
Walking in the door,
you automatically...

43:00.403 --> 43:02.449
Yes, yeah...
okay, so you got some

43:02.492 --> 43:04.190
little, you know,

43:04.233 --> 43:06.366
- holiday stories.
- Exactly.

43:06.409 --> 43:08.063
- Exactly.
- Local lore.

43:08.107 --> 43:09.848
You better take your vitamins.

43:09.891 --> 43:12.067
[laughing]
Thank you.

43:12.111 --> 43:13.634
Do you want anything
gift-wrapped?

43:13.678 --> 43:16.637
No, thank you.
I don't need a receipt.

43:16.681 --> 43:18.117
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, yeah.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.640
- Happy New Year.
- There will be a new baby

43:19.684 --> 43:22.034
- in The Bookstore.
- That'll be fabulous.

43:23.601 --> 43:26.081
- Fab-u-lous.
- All right, tell Charlie.

43:26.125 --> 43:27.648
- Yup.
- Okay, thanks, Barbara.

43:27.692 --> 43:28.780
Root for the good guys.

43:30.695 --> 43:32.653
I said they're...
you know...

43:32.697 --> 43:34.612
they're doing
a children's book.

43:34.655 --> 43:36.788
She said, "Oh, I just wrote
a children's book."

43:36.831 --> 43:39.791
So I thought to myself,
oh, that's how I know her.

43:39.834 --> 43:41.619
I must have just met her
at that book fair

43:41.662 --> 43:43.577
last week in Providence.

43:43.621 --> 43:46.101
So I leaned over and I said,
"What's your name?"

43:46.145 --> 43:47.886
And she said, "Carly Simon."

43:47.929 --> 43:50.192
[laughter]

43:52.717 --> 43:55.894
I think there's
a special visitor coming.

43:55.937 --> 43:57.591
And it's you.

43:57.635 --> 44:01.203
- I brought you a salad.
- Oh, sweet.

44:01.247 --> 44:03.466
It's not Italian dressing.
I'm so sorry.

44:05.512 --> 44:07.557
I didn't have time to make it.

44:07.601 --> 44:09.168
Go, go, go.
Go, go, go.

44:09.211 --> 44:10.952
- All right, take that.
- Okay, let's go

44:10.996 --> 44:12.780
heat up some...
some brisket.

44:15.217 --> 44:17.393
Oh, Paddington has to eat

44:17.437 --> 44:18.873
- all by himself.
- [laughing]

44:20.832 --> 44:23.225
That is...

44:23.269 --> 44:25.184
just the sweetest thing.

44:32.408 --> 44:33.801
And you can get it?

44:34.933 --> 44:36.674
I'll try.

44:36.717 --> 44:37.979
All right.
And the other one?

44:38.023 --> 44:39.154
- Is that--
- I'll try.

44:39.198 --> 44:40.460
Okay, great.

44:47.685 --> 44:49.991
[laughing]

44:50.035 --> 44:52.298
- All right.
- Okay.

44:52.341 --> 44:54.430
You've made my day
by buying this book.

44:54.474 --> 44:56.041
Oh, I'm so excited.

44:56.084 --> 44:57.782
I'm going to read it
to my daughter.

44:57.825 --> 44:59.087
- You read it to her.
- And we'll come in

44:59.131 --> 45:00.306
- and tell you.
- Okay, okay.

45:00.349 --> 45:03.613
[whistle blowing]

45:03.657 --> 45:07.095
RX, $29.75.

45:07.139 --> 45:08.401
And wrap it?

45:11.230 --> 45:12.971
Lewis.
Lewis, who?

45:13.014 --> 45:15.103
- We come up every year.
- Yeah, yeah.

45:15.147 --> 45:16.888
You're a rare breed.

45:16.931 --> 45:18.585
You ought to be
stuffed and mounted.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.023
- I think it's wonderful.
- And--

45:22.067 --> 45:23.503
I love this kind of shop.

45:23.546 --> 45:25.287
And I thought to myself...

45:25.331 --> 45:26.811
suddenly,
I had this image

45:26.854 --> 45:29.117
of Len Riggio,

45:29.161 --> 45:31.641
who owned Barnes & Noble
at the time,

45:31.685 --> 45:34.862
and his study,
where he has the heads

45:34.906 --> 45:37.822
of all the independent
booksellers,

45:37.865 --> 45:40.085
stuffed and mounted
on his trophy wall.

45:40.128 --> 45:41.695
[laughing]

45:54.752 --> 45:56.188
And what are you reading now?

45:56.231 --> 45:58.581
Uh, the one
I'm reading now is...

46:01.149 --> 46:03.804
let's see if I have
another copy somewhere.

46:03.848 --> 46:05.806
It's called
"The Girl with a Leica."

46:05.850 --> 46:08.113
- "The Girl with a Leica."
- "Girl with a Leica."

46:08.156 --> 46:10.071
And it's a great story.

46:12.247 --> 46:13.814
Let's go down here

46:13.858 --> 46:15.381
- to the fiction section.
- Okay.

46:15.424 --> 46:16.991
- How have you been?
- I'm good, thank you.

46:17.035 --> 46:18.776
I'm very good, thank you.

46:18.819 --> 46:22.170
I... I'm going
to be a grandpa.

46:22.214 --> 46:23.955
- You're gonna be a grandpa!
- I'm gonna be a grandpa.

46:23.998 --> 46:25.913
Oh, that's the best.
That's the best.

46:25.957 --> 46:27.828
That's the best.
My kids are coming today,

46:27.872 --> 46:29.874
- and I'm so excited.
- For a young person...

46:29.917 --> 46:31.745
for a young person
like us...

46:31.789 --> 46:33.442
Like us,
it's hard to believe.

46:33.486 --> 46:36.837
So, so... this is
one of the best-written books

46:36.881 --> 46:38.621
- I've ever read.
- All right, so maybe

46:38.665 --> 46:40.449
- I'd better buy this one.
- You should buy it.

46:40.493 --> 46:41.929
It took me three days

46:41.973 --> 46:43.322
- to read this book.
- Oh, my God.

46:43.365 --> 46:45.019
My bookmark never
had a chance.

46:45.063 --> 46:47.195
- [laughing]
- I would close it,

46:47.239 --> 46:48.631
and I would open it
right back up.

46:48.675 --> 46:50.242
You could sell me on anything.

46:50.285 --> 46:52.331
These are-- These are...

46:52.374 --> 46:55.987
so well-drawn...

46:56.030 --> 46:58.554
portraits
of a Midwestern family.

46:58.598 --> 47:00.208
He's a great
Midwestern writer.

47:00.252 --> 47:02.080
I have to find-- all right,
I'm going to read these.

47:02.123 --> 47:04.386
- No-no-no, you don't--
- No, I need to.

47:04.430 --> 47:06.911
- It sounds delightful.
- They're so... delicious.

47:06.954 --> 47:09.174
That sounds fabulous.
Okay, this.

47:09.217 --> 47:11.132
And I have to read this.
Thank you so much.

47:11.176 --> 47:13.004
Happy, healthy.
Great to see you.

47:13.047 --> 47:14.875
- Mmm.
- Take care.

47:14.919 --> 47:16.529
- See you again.
- I'll be back

47:16.572 --> 47:18.487
- to discuss these.
- And send me emails also.

47:18.531 --> 47:19.837
My email address is

47:19.880 --> 47:21.186
- on the bookmark.
- Okay.

47:30.760 --> 47:34.764
"And I'd grown from solitude,
blushed when I stumbled,

47:34.808 --> 47:36.941
loved strangers
and bread and butter,

47:36.984 --> 47:39.900
and made long trips through
the rain on my bicycle,

47:39.944 --> 47:42.424
stared wretchedly
through lighted windows,

47:42.468 --> 47:45.906
grinned wryly to think
how little I was understood,

47:45.950 --> 47:48.213
and lived in a state
of raging excitement."

47:49.910 --> 47:51.869
She was 21 years old.

47:51.912 --> 47:54.132
- He was 31.
- Ooh.

47:54.175 --> 47:56.177
He came to
this country illegally,

47:56.221 --> 47:58.788
because by the time
the rest of his family

47:58.832 --> 48:00.703
had emigrated
from Poland and...

48:00.747 --> 48:02.792
What are we looking for?

48:02.836 --> 48:04.142
It's okay.

48:04.185 --> 48:06.013
- Oh, uh...
- I'll take this.

48:06.057 --> 48:07.972
And by the time
he tried to get here,

48:08.015 --> 48:10.017
because he was out wandering
with the Socialists,

48:10.061 --> 48:12.237
and he came back to the house,
and there was a note

48:12.280 --> 48:14.021
on the door that said,
"Gone to America."

48:14.065 --> 48:15.936
So he tried
to come to America,

48:15.980 --> 48:17.677
and-- but the quota
was in effect,

48:17.720 --> 48:19.548
and so he signed on
with the Canadians.

48:19.592 --> 48:21.855
- Oh.
- And-- for free passage

48:21.899 --> 48:23.726
from Hamburg to Montreal.

48:23.770 --> 48:25.163
Oh, wow.
Oh, my God.

48:25.206 --> 48:27.165
So he gets to Montreal,

48:27.208 --> 48:28.818
and he jumps off the ship.

48:28.862 --> 48:30.690
He's not going
to Saskatchewan.

48:30.733 --> 48:32.344
Oh, he does?
He swims to shore?

48:32.387 --> 48:34.912
Yeah, and he--
and he finds his cousin,

48:34.955 --> 48:36.826
who lives in Montreal.

48:36.870 --> 48:38.828
And they-- they stole
a rowboat or something.

48:38.872 --> 48:40.743
And they rode across
the St. Lawrence,

48:40.787 --> 48:43.094
and he came down to New York,
and he moved in

48:43.137 --> 48:45.009
with his parents,
who were already in Brooklyn.

48:45.052 --> 48:46.836
- Wow, great.
- He met my mother

48:46.880 --> 48:48.969
at a high school dance.

48:49.013 --> 48:50.971
He went there,
and she had a date.

48:51.015 --> 48:52.973
And he said,
"I'll take you home."

48:53.017 --> 48:56.977
- He swept her...
- He swept her off her feet.

48:57.021 --> 49:00.763
There are two types
of... of novels.

49:00.807 --> 49:02.983
One that you sit
at home and write.

49:03.027 --> 49:05.246
And one that you tell
other people about

49:05.290 --> 49:07.205
- sitting at a bar.
- Just-- right.

49:07.248 --> 49:09.294
And this is...
I'm just sitting at a bar.

49:09.337 --> 49:11.252
I've been sitting at a bar
for 43 years.

49:14.908 --> 49:16.997
[soft piano]

49:21.088 --> 49:22.611
So, so the other thing
he said was,

49:22.655 --> 49:24.309
if you have
two different editions

49:24.352 --> 49:26.093
of a book...

49:26.137 --> 49:28.400
Like "Joy of Cooking"
was out in a little

49:28.443 --> 49:30.402
mass market paperback,
and then it was out

49:30.445 --> 49:33.971
- in a larger spiral bound.
- That's the one I have.

49:34.014 --> 49:36.799
They had an edition
with spiral bound for a while.

49:36.843 --> 49:38.888
So he said, you know, "Always
get the more expensive one.

49:38.932 --> 49:40.194
You make more money off that."

49:40.238 --> 49:41.848
- Mm-hmm.
- And Rita,

49:41.891 --> 49:44.285
who worked here.
Remember Rita?

49:44.329 --> 49:45.808
- No, I don't remember Rita.
- No, she was

49:45.852 --> 49:47.636
one of my first employees.

49:47.680 --> 49:49.943
She stood up,

49:49.987 --> 49:51.858
stamped her feet,
and she said,

49:51.901 --> 49:54.078
"If Francine Derry
comes in here

49:54.121 --> 49:55.905
looking for
'The Joy of Cooking,'

49:55.949 --> 49:57.472
I don't want to have
to sell her

49:57.516 --> 49:59.083
- a more expensive one."
- A more expensive one.

49:59.126 --> 50:01.041
"She's the one
I buy my underwear from,

50:01.085 --> 50:02.956
and I'm not gonna try

50:03.000 --> 50:04.697
to make
any extra money off her."

50:04.740 --> 50:07.004
And I'll always remember
that that's--

50:07.047 --> 50:09.571
that you don't
just try to make money.

50:09.615 --> 50:12.226
- Yes, yeah.
- And-- And look at me.

50:12.270 --> 50:14.141
I've been
a poor bookseller

50:14.185 --> 50:15.969
all my life.
[laughing]

50:16.013 --> 50:17.536
I tried not to make any money.

50:17.579 --> 50:19.233
[laughing]

50:19.277 --> 50:20.713
But you'll make
some right now because...

50:20.756 --> 50:22.236
- Oh, yeah?
- ...you've got a customer.

50:22.280 --> 50:23.890
Oh, somebody's right there.

50:23.933 --> 50:25.239
- To give you money.
- Okay.

50:30.462 --> 50:33.117
So were the kids all here
this Christmas?

50:33.160 --> 50:34.596
- My kids?
- Yeah.

50:34.640 --> 50:36.816
Yeah, but I'm furious
at my daughter.

50:36.859 --> 50:39.427
- You're furious?
- Yeah.

50:39.471 --> 50:41.081
Don't forget
your bag this time.

50:41.125 --> 50:42.865
- Okay, I won't.
- Okay.

50:45.129 --> 50:46.695
But if I make something nice,

50:46.739 --> 50:49.133
'cause Sam's gonna
come tomorrow,

50:49.176 --> 50:50.699
do you like scallops?

50:50.743 --> 50:52.658
Uh, I do.

50:52.701 --> 50:54.051
- Okay.
- All right.

50:54.094 --> 50:55.791
We'll make some for you too.

50:55.835 --> 50:57.184
All right.

50:59.317 --> 51:01.014
Jim!

51:01.058 --> 51:02.146
I have books here.

51:02.189 --> 51:03.408
- Oh!
- That I...

51:03.451 --> 51:05.453
- [dinging bell]
- ...got a call for

51:05.497 --> 51:07.455
about two months ago.

51:12.069 --> 51:13.853
Maybe I don't.

51:13.896 --> 51:16.029
I remember you ordering
a couple of books.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.639
[man] Do you want me
to pick you up three?

51:17.683 --> 51:19.598
It was a Steve Hamilton book.

51:19.641 --> 51:21.513
And a...

51:21.556 --> 51:23.167
Yes, it was Steve Hamilton.

51:25.430 --> 51:27.606
And Eisler.

51:27.649 --> 51:29.564
- Barry Eisler.
- Barry Eisler?

51:29.608 --> 51:32.741
Maybe like
the pharmaceuticals,

51:32.785 --> 51:34.613
you know, CVS.

51:34.656 --> 51:36.223
You don't pick it up
in two weeks,

51:36.267 --> 51:37.877
they put it
back on the shelf.

51:37.920 --> 51:40.053
I'm gonna look
on my shelf at home.

51:40.097 --> 51:42.795
And see if--
maybe I picked it up.

51:42.838 --> 51:44.971
- I think you might have.
- Bye, Jim.

51:45.014 --> 51:47.321
- I think you might have.
- You think so?

51:47.365 --> 51:49.149
I don't know.
It's all a blur.

51:49.193 --> 51:51.456
Another successful transaction.

51:51.499 --> 51:53.284
[laughing]

51:53.327 --> 51:56.635
He came in,
and he bought it on the 10th.

51:56.678 --> 51:58.985
He must have really
enjoyed the books.

51:59.028 --> 52:01.422
[soft guitar]

52:07.080 --> 52:08.603
"Over the snow,
my creaking feet,

52:08.647 --> 52:12.520
"disturbed the slumbering
village street.

52:12.564 --> 52:15.523
"By profanation
by your leave,

52:15.567 --> 52:19.527
at 10 o'clock
of a winter eve."

52:19.571 --> 52:21.486
I mean, it's fine,
just like...

52:21.529 --> 52:24.184
- Yeah, right.
- But now she has to...

52:24.228 --> 52:25.577
Both places, right.

52:27.187 --> 52:29.320
Pretty-- Pretty cool.

52:29.363 --> 52:31.148
All over--
All over town.

52:31.191 --> 52:33.324
The word is--
the word's getting out.

52:36.109 --> 52:38.459
So-- So,
Tom Stoppard comes in,

52:38.503 --> 52:41.419
and... and he--

52:41.462 --> 52:43.682
he compliments me
on the shop because--

52:43.725 --> 52:46.293
because he found a book that
he didn't think he'd find.

52:46.337 --> 52:48.730
He said, "I like the fact
that you have your...

52:48.774 --> 52:50.515
your biographies
next to your authors."

52:50.558 --> 52:52.299
So there's
a biography of Hemingway

52:52.343 --> 52:53.953
- next to Hemingway's work.
- Oh, really?

52:53.996 --> 52:56.347
So, I said-- I said,
well, I learned...

52:56.390 --> 52:58.827
I learned my trade
at the Gotham Book Mart.

52:58.871 --> 53:00.829
And he said, "Oh...

53:00.873 --> 53:03.180
we shall never see
the likes of that again."

53:03.223 --> 53:05.399
In his deep,
sonorous voice.

53:05.443 --> 53:06.748
Which was my cue to give him

53:06.792 --> 53:08.707
my copy...
a copy of my book,

53:08.750 --> 53:10.622
"My Life
at the Gotham Book Mart."

53:10.665 --> 53:11.927
- Yes, yeah.
- And he looked at it,

53:11.971 --> 53:13.625
and he said,
"May I purchase this?"

53:13.668 --> 53:15.975
I said, certainly.
But you know what,

53:16.018 --> 53:17.759
last night
I found a book for you.

53:17.803 --> 53:19.587
- Yeah?
- On my shelf

53:19.631 --> 53:20.980
that I'm gonna give to you
for your birthday.

53:21.023 --> 53:23.374
- Okay.
- The truth is,

53:23.417 --> 53:26.290
whatever I've learned
in my life...

53:26.333 --> 53:28.379
comes mostly from...

53:30.772 --> 53:32.426
the characters who I've read,

53:32.470 --> 53:34.646
who I've absorbed,
who I relate to,

53:34.689 --> 53:36.256
are the fictional characters.

53:36.300 --> 53:38.215
Fiction is the filter
through which

53:38.258 --> 53:40.913
I see the world.

53:42.262 --> 53:44.395
So, um...

53:49.617 --> 53:51.706
So, I don't... run away
from the world...

53:53.621 --> 53:55.188
Um...

54:10.159 --> 54:11.596
How do you get outta here?

54:11.639 --> 54:14.076
[laughing]

54:14.120 --> 54:15.513
Don't drink that.

54:17.515 --> 54:18.951
Here, let me have
some of that.

54:18.994 --> 54:20.605
It's very... jelly.

54:23.434 --> 54:25.305
Really?

54:25.349 --> 54:27.220
I think you're gonna like
what I have better.

54:27.264 --> 54:29.875
- [phone ringing]
- Hello, Bookstore.

54:29.918 --> 54:34.488
Hi, this is the Carol Robbins
auxiliary department.

54:34.532 --> 54:38.449
How can we...
help you, sir? Ma'am?

54:38.492 --> 54:40.407
Hello. Hello?

54:40.451 --> 54:42.366
Is there anyone there?
Is there anyone there?

54:42.409 --> 54:43.932
Is there anyone there?

54:45.282 --> 54:46.674
Carol, are you there?

54:46.718 --> 54:48.981
[laughing]

54:49.024 --> 54:51.288
Carol?

54:51.331 --> 54:53.551
Mrs. Antrobus.

54:53.594 --> 54:54.987
Becky Thatcher.

55:03.038 --> 55:04.605
[woman] Matt,
can we add two things?

55:04.649 --> 55:06.955
- Sure.
- Okay.

55:06.999 --> 55:10.481
Can we add
a manly bread book?

55:10.524 --> 55:12.483
- The-- which one?
- A breadmaking book

55:12.526 --> 55:16.269
that a guy who's just
getting into making bread

55:16.313 --> 55:18.315
- is gonna like.
- Huh. Okay.

55:19.577 --> 55:21.318
"In main lesson today,
we learned

55:21.361 --> 55:23.755
of the mighty conquest
of the great greenness,

55:23.798 --> 55:25.583
lord of all living things.

55:25.626 --> 55:28.020
How all things come and go.

55:28.063 --> 55:30.022
How love shines
from our brow

55:30.065 --> 55:33.286
if we have
died at least once.

55:33.330 --> 55:36.463
And are courageous
as dragonflies.

55:36.507 --> 55:40.511
And that is the only solution
to a world gone mad."

55:40.554 --> 55:43.122
[whispering]
One-three-nine-two...

55:43.165 --> 55:46.952
six-four-three-two...
seven-six-nine-one.

55:46.995 --> 55:51.783
Um... I want
the Mary Trump book.

55:51.826 --> 55:53.175
- Uh-huh.
- But I wanted to look

55:53.219 --> 55:56.004
and see what else
you had, so...

55:56.048 --> 55:57.745
I should have brought
the paper with me.

55:57.789 --> 56:00.835
- What?
- The Times.

56:00.879 --> 56:02.402
- The bestsellers.
- Oh.

56:02.446 --> 56:04.404
Let me go get you
a Times from last week.

56:04.448 --> 56:05.884
Okay, okay.

56:10.845 --> 56:13.108
[sighing]

56:13.152 --> 56:15.284
"In science,
extra main lesson today,

56:15.328 --> 56:17.286
we learned how vivid,
abundant,

56:17.330 --> 56:21.552
and wild blossoming is
in the highest places.

56:21.595 --> 56:24.163
How we sit around
a pond of knowledge,

56:24.206 --> 56:25.730
how we notice
at the edge of that pond,

56:25.773 --> 56:28.210
a shimmering chrysalis.

56:28.254 --> 56:31.562
How slowly, steadily,
the chrysalis molts,

56:31.605 --> 56:34.086
unfolds to recognition.

56:34.129 --> 56:36.610
How the young
dragonfly emerges,

56:36.654 --> 56:39.352
teeters on a blade of grass
testing its wings.

56:39.396 --> 56:42.964
How bravely, clumsily,
it tries to lift off.

56:43.008 --> 56:45.445
Often falling back,
but finally,

56:45.489 --> 56:48.753
finally, finally
into the meadow."

56:52.017 --> 56:54.411
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:54.454 --> 56:56.761
The world's oldest
and newest bookseller.

56:56.804 --> 57:02.419
Two weeks ago, I looked
at my bank statement.

57:04.203 --> 57:06.814
I looked at... what I have,
what the registers says

57:06.858 --> 57:12.472
that I have, and what...

57:12.516 --> 57:16.476
bills were coming due
at the end of the month.

57:16.520 --> 57:18.086
That was two weeks ago.

57:18.130 --> 57:21.046
I'm aware of...
of the...

57:26.312 --> 57:29.881
the place that
The Bookstore and I are in.

57:32.100 --> 57:33.885
It's a big love.

57:39.281 --> 57:40.892
Well...

57:40.935 --> 57:43.590
everything is informed by...

57:46.724 --> 57:48.987
kindness, patience,
generosity.

57:50.249 --> 57:51.642
I mean,
he's got time for it all.

57:51.685 --> 57:53.121
He's got time for everyone.

57:54.601 --> 57:56.342
Like, truly.

57:56.385 --> 57:58.083
That's been my experience.

57:58.126 --> 58:00.215
And it's been--
my favorite thing to do is

58:00.259 --> 58:02.261
to come in here
very anonymously

58:02.304 --> 58:03.784
and just walk
in the front door

58:03.828 --> 58:05.351
and sit in
one of the pink chairs

58:05.394 --> 58:06.613
and watch
his interaction with people

58:06.657 --> 58:08.136
here at the front desk.

58:13.533 --> 58:15.883
Because he knows
what the right thing to do is

58:15.927 --> 58:18.669
for The Bookstore.
It's always... it's in him.

58:18.712 --> 58:21.280
Because I... sort of
delude myself,

58:21.323 --> 58:24.805
and I'm like...
everything's great.

58:24.849 --> 58:28.069
Um... when I realized
that he was serious about this,

58:28.113 --> 58:31.899
I asked him,
"Is this... this is it?"

58:31.943 --> 58:33.510
Because I didn't know that--
that it was gonna be,

58:33.553 --> 58:35.294
"Save The Bookstore."

58:35.337 --> 58:36.948
I didn't--
maybe I didn't realize,

58:36.991 --> 58:38.340
maybe I've been so preoccupied
with my own stuff,

58:38.384 --> 58:40.255
but, I said, like,

58:40.299 --> 58:41.996
"That's... that's
what this is?"

58:42.040 --> 58:44.085
And he was kind of like,
"You know, yeah."

58:49.961 --> 58:53.225
"Let him receive the season's
increment into his mind.

58:53.268 --> 58:56.010
Let him work it
into the soil.

58:56.054 --> 58:58.143
The finest growth
that farmland can produce

58:58.186 --> 59:00.798
is a careful farmer.

59:00.841 --> 59:03.235
Make the race a better head.

59:03.278 --> 59:05.193
Make the world
a better piece of ground."

59:12.636 --> 59:14.594
- Save The Bookstore.
- Save the--

59:14.638 --> 59:16.770
That's what I meant,
oldest and newest.

59:16.814 --> 59:19.556
Okay.
Save The Bookstore.

59:19.599 --> 59:21.383
Save our ship.

59:21.427 --> 59:22.863
Save our--
save our bookstore.

59:22.907 --> 59:24.343
- S.O.B.
- S.O.B.

59:24.386 --> 59:25.823
[Matt laughing]

59:25.866 --> 59:27.476
Let's try this.

59:30.262 --> 59:32.612
"Hello, Bookstore
fans and friends.

59:32.656 --> 59:34.919
Hello, Bookstore friends,
near and far.

59:36.137 --> 59:37.443
Wondering
how things are going

59:37.486 --> 59:39.837
at The Bookstore
during the pandemic?

59:39.880 --> 59:41.360
They're not going well,
my friends.

59:43.318 --> 59:45.669
Business is down.

59:45.712 --> 59:49.760
Sales each week are
what they used to be each day.

59:49.803 --> 59:52.545
The book you may not have
known but fell in love with.

59:52.589 --> 59:54.939
The glass of wine
at Get Lit.

59:54.982 --> 59:56.854
The poetry reading
or book signing event

59:56.897 --> 59:58.769
that reminds you
of the large presence

59:58.812 --> 1:00:01.467
in your life that is
this small shop

1:00:01.510 --> 1:00:03.208
on Housatonic Street.

1:00:05.079 --> 1:00:06.951
In the old days,
I might have sold books

1:00:06.994 --> 1:00:10.171
to your parents
or grandparents.

1:00:10.215 --> 1:00:14.219
Today, I'm selling them
curbside to you,

1:00:14.262 --> 1:00:18.615
to your children,
and your grandchildren,

1:00:18.658 --> 1:00:20.660
until we can safely
open our doors again,

1:00:20.704 --> 1:00:23.010
and I just don't know
when that will be.

1:00:23.054 --> 1:00:26.187
I most humbly ask you
to help me get through.

1:00:26.231 --> 1:00:28.625
It's yours
as much as it is mine.

1:00:31.976 --> 1:00:33.891
None of us would even
want to imagine it

1:00:33.934 --> 1:00:35.327
no longer being here.

1:00:38.112 --> 1:00:40.158
When I think
of the many roads

1:00:40.201 --> 1:00:42.203
I took to become your
bookseller here in Lenox,

1:00:42.247 --> 1:00:44.118
I cannot imagine
who or what else

1:00:44.162 --> 1:00:45.729
I might have become.

1:00:45.772 --> 1:00:48.949
It has always felt to me
a perfect fit,

1:00:48.993 --> 1:00:50.995
and to judge from the loyalty
you have shown

1:00:51.038 --> 1:00:53.301
through the years,
you think so too.

1:00:55.086 --> 1:00:56.957
With that in mind,
I am appealing today

1:00:57.001 --> 1:00:58.219
for your help.

1:00:58.263 --> 1:01:00.047
Thanks for reading.

1:01:00.091 --> 1:01:02.528
Be well. Be safe.

1:01:03.964 --> 1:01:05.357
Matt Tannenbaum."

1:01:24.028 --> 1:01:26.291
[Matt] Did you hear
my knock-knock joke?

1:01:26.334 --> 1:01:28.597
The guy who invented
the knock-knock joke

1:01:28.641 --> 1:01:30.295
won the "No-Bell."

1:01:30.338 --> 1:01:32.732
[laughter]

1:01:32.776 --> 1:01:35.430
All right.
Merry Christmas.

1:01:35.474 --> 1:01:37.519
Happy New Year.
Happy Chanukah.

1:01:37.563 --> 1:01:39.130
Happy, whatever, Kwanzaa.

1:01:46.615 --> 1:01:47.747
And it really--
it goes down.

1:01:47.791 --> 1:01:49.096
You can feel it going...

1:01:49.140 --> 1:01:51.620
- duh-duh-duh...
- [laughter]

1:01:51.664 --> 1:01:54.275
Go down quicker.
Go down quicker!

1:01:54.319 --> 1:01:56.408
- Oh, is it stuck?
- No, it's not stuck,

1:01:56.451 --> 1:01:57.670
- it's just...
- It's so lovely.

1:01:57.714 --> 1:01:59.106
It's warming.
I love this stuff.

1:01:59.150 --> 1:02:00.238
Yes-- that's what
I mean, yeah...

1:02:00.281 --> 1:02:01.761
It tastes like...

1:02:03.894 --> 1:02:05.591
Why, did you decide
not to like it?

1:02:05.634 --> 1:02:08.681
- Like mulled cider.
- Like mulled cider.

1:02:08.725 --> 1:02:11.466
- All right, fine.
- Oh, you didn't--

1:02:13.207 --> 1:02:15.427
[hiccup]

1:02:15.470 --> 1:02:17.081
- [hiccupping]
- Charlie wanted some.

1:02:17.124 --> 1:02:19.605
[hiccupping]
"Charlie the Tramp."

1:02:21.172 --> 1:02:23.130
- "Incroyable."
- "Incroyable."

1:02:23.174 --> 1:02:24.958
- [laughter]
- Sophie's--

1:02:25.002 --> 1:02:28.179
- Sophie's new favorite word.
- Oh, is it?

1:02:28.222 --> 1:02:29.963
I've been refusing
to say it correctly.

1:02:30.007 --> 1:02:31.530
[laughing]

1:02:31.573 --> 1:02:33.445
Go ahead,
how did you used to say it?

1:02:33.488 --> 1:02:35.839
- I'll tell you later.
- "Incroyable."

1:02:35.882 --> 1:02:37.710
- "Incroyable."
- "Incroyable."

1:02:37.754 --> 1:02:39.756
"Incroyable."
L'chaim.

1:02:39.799 --> 1:02:41.714
- L'chaim.
- L'chaim. L'chaim.

1:02:41.758 --> 1:02:43.716
[Matt] L'chaim.
"Incroyable."

1:02:48.068 --> 1:02:50.984
Ah, that goes down
really hard.

1:02:51.028 --> 1:02:54.379
He said to me, he said,
"I want to tell you a story."

1:02:54.422 --> 1:02:55.989
He said, "When I was
a little boy,

1:02:56.033 --> 1:02:58.035
I grew up in Santa Fe,
New Mexico.

1:02:58.078 --> 1:03:01.168
And my dad, one day,
when I was a little kid,

1:03:01.212 --> 1:03:03.823
says, 'Otto, there's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

1:03:03.867 --> 1:03:05.956
It's time you should
meet this guy.'

1:03:05.999 --> 1:03:07.827
And he took me
to the old part of town,

1:03:07.871 --> 1:03:09.524
and there's an old,
wooden sidewalk,

1:03:09.568 --> 1:03:11.483
and there's an old man
leaning a chair up

1:03:11.526 --> 1:03:13.050
against the... wall.

1:03:13.093 --> 1:03:15.487
And-- And my father
introduced me.

1:03:15.530 --> 1:03:19.317
He said, 'Otto, I want you
to meet Sheriff Pat Garrett.'"

1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:22.842
And as he said this to me,
he held out his hand,

1:03:22.886 --> 1:03:25.540
as if to say,
"Shake the hand

1:03:25.584 --> 1:03:29.109
that shook the hand of the man
who shot Billy the Kid."

1:03:30.981 --> 1:03:33.244
Pat Garrett died years
before Otto was born.

1:03:33.287 --> 1:03:35.768
[laughing]

1:03:35.812 --> 1:03:38.162
What was--
what was that about?

1:03:38.205 --> 1:03:40.642
[soft guitar]

1:04:26.427 --> 1:04:28.908
[soft guitar continues]

1:04:45.838 --> 1:04:48.841
[soft guitar continues]

1:04:58.895 --> 1:05:00.984
I wish that
I'd grown up in this town.

1:05:01.027 --> 1:05:03.334
And then I became
the guy that, um,

1:05:03.377 --> 1:05:05.727
other people see
when they grow up.

1:05:18.610 --> 1:05:21.482
[sighing]
Hmm.

1:05:32.580 --> 1:05:34.974
[soft guitar]

1:05:47.247 --> 1:05:50.859
[soft guitar continues]

1:06:04.438 --> 1:06:06.353
[reporter] The pandemic is
taking a toll on many

1:06:06.397 --> 1:06:08.007
local business owners,

1:06:08.051 --> 1:06:10.140
and Matt Tannenbaum is
no exception.

1:06:10.183 --> 1:06:12.011
When I looked at
the bank account, I said,

1:06:12.055 --> 1:06:14.318
"Oh, oh, we're not
gonna make it."

1:06:14.361 --> 1:06:17.060
And once I realized
we're not gonna make it,

1:06:17.103 --> 1:06:19.018
I thought,
"Well, that's...

1:06:19.062 --> 1:06:21.107
I can't imagine
not making it."

1:06:21.151 --> 1:06:23.457
[reporter] The owner
of The Bookstore in Lenox

1:06:23.501 --> 1:06:26.243
started a GoFundMe to save
his store earlier this week,

1:06:26.286 --> 1:06:28.288
and in just
a couple of days,

1:06:28.332 --> 1:06:31.944
it's already raised
more than $60,000.

1:06:31.988 --> 1:06:33.902
I kid around. I always
wanted to be a writer.

1:06:33.946 --> 1:06:35.817
But I guess thank you notes
are what I'm gonna be writing.

1:06:38.081 --> 1:06:39.778
August-- well, August 12th,

1:06:39.821 --> 1:06:42.172
it says 550 donors have
answered the call.

1:06:42.215 --> 1:06:43.738
- Is that still true?
- Let's look.

1:06:45.088 --> 1:06:46.437
You were
on a death watch here.

1:06:46.480 --> 1:06:47.699
- Weren't you?
- Yeah.

1:06:47.742 --> 1:06:49.005
Look what they do for me.

1:06:49.048 --> 1:06:50.354
They-- immediately.

1:06:50.397 --> 1:06:53.966
Within 23 hours,
we met that goal.

1:06:54.010 --> 1:06:55.881
And then it just
kept climbing.

1:06:55.924 --> 1:06:59.493
And then when people said,
"Well, you know...

1:06:59.537 --> 1:07:01.713
raise your goal.
Keep going."

1:07:01.756 --> 1:07:03.758
You-- as I said
in my latest Instagram,

1:07:03.802 --> 1:07:06.892
uh, that
they helped me produce,

1:07:06.935 --> 1:07:09.590
the wolf is...
no longer at the door.

1:07:09.634 --> 1:07:11.375
- Yeah.
- But he's still in the woods.

1:07:11.418 --> 1:07:13.942
- Right.
- And, you know, this way,

1:07:13.986 --> 1:07:16.032
I'm gonna be able
to get out of debt.

1:07:16.075 --> 1:07:17.511
- Right.
- I'm gonna be able

1:07:17.555 --> 1:07:19.296
to get out of debt,
and I'll be able...

1:07:19.339 --> 1:07:21.559
to say to the publisher,
I'll say, listen,

1:07:21.602 --> 1:07:25.302
I'm sending you that money
that I owe you, on time.

1:07:25.345 --> 1:07:27.869
Sure, there's this image,
and then there's reality.

1:07:27.913 --> 1:07:29.654
And I'm wondering
how the image and the reality

1:07:29.697 --> 1:07:31.308
are the same,

1:07:31.351 --> 1:07:32.787
and how they're
completely different?

1:07:32.831 --> 1:07:34.485
- I think they're the same.
- You do?

1:07:34.528 --> 1:07:36.574
- I absolutely...
- So I have this image

1:07:36.617 --> 1:07:38.619
of this guy who's in love
with literature

1:07:38.663 --> 1:07:41.100
and can talk to customers
about Shakespeare

1:07:41.144 --> 1:07:43.102
and, you know,
William Shirer,

1:07:43.146 --> 1:07:44.408
- is that right?
- Yeah.

1:07:44.451 --> 1:07:47.889
And for me to have the...

1:07:49.065 --> 1:07:51.197
the good fortune

1:07:51.241 --> 1:07:53.808
to spend my life
with these things.

1:07:53.852 --> 1:07:55.767
- [camera snap]
- You're living the dream.

1:07:55.810 --> 1:07:58.857
I'm living the dream.
I have a country bookstore.

1:07:58.900 --> 1:08:00.424
My-- My wife...

1:08:00.467 --> 1:08:03.601
passed away
after 11 years.

1:08:03.644 --> 1:08:06.734
Uh, and then I had...
part of the dream.

1:08:06.778 --> 1:08:08.997
- After 11 years of marriage?
- After 11 years of marriage.

1:08:09.041 --> 1:08:11.043
- So I was-- my--
- Did she enjoy running

1:08:11.087 --> 1:08:13.045
- The Bookstore?
- Ah, no.

1:08:13.089 --> 1:08:14.873
- [laughing]
- No... that was not her.

1:08:14.916 --> 1:08:16.396
- That was not her
- That was your thing.

1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:17.919
That was my thing.
Absolutely.

1:08:17.963 --> 1:08:20.183
But then I was--
I had two little children,

1:08:20.226 --> 1:08:22.402
seven and three years old
to raise.

1:08:22.446 --> 1:08:25.449
And then that's when
this woman, Jo Baldwin,

1:08:25.492 --> 1:08:27.320
who had worked for me
for years before,

1:08:27.364 --> 1:08:30.497
was... most important to me.

1:08:30.541 --> 1:08:33.283
So I could go home
every day at 2:00, 2:30,

1:08:33.326 --> 1:08:35.546
to meet the kids
after school.

1:08:35.589 --> 1:08:37.548
Take the kids home. Bring them
to school in the morning.

1:08:37.591 --> 1:08:39.506
And became the mom.

1:08:39.550 --> 1:08:41.813
And that was... just
the most incredible thing.

1:08:41.856 --> 1:08:43.031
That was... wild.

1:08:43.075 --> 1:08:44.642
But then...

1:08:44.685 --> 1:08:46.165
and then they grew up
in the store.

1:08:46.209 --> 1:08:47.775
And they grew up
knowing about books.

1:08:47.819 --> 1:08:50.387
And... that's why

1:08:50.430 --> 1:08:52.606
Shawnee,
you know, wants...

1:08:52.650 --> 1:08:54.826
knows how important
the store is to me

1:08:54.869 --> 1:08:56.480
and wants it to continue.

1:08:56.523 --> 1:08:58.569
- Mm-hmm.
- So, you know, 'cause,

1:08:58.612 --> 1:09:00.179
when you think about it,
who do we sell it to?

1:09:00.223 --> 1:09:02.486
Do we sell it to anybody?
Who would... who...

1:09:02.529 --> 1:09:04.575
First of all,
off the record now.

1:09:04.618 --> 1:09:06.185
- Yeah.
- Who--

1:09:06.229 --> 1:09:07.534
I'm gonna go over
everything with you.

1:09:07.578 --> 1:09:09.319
Who would...

1:09:09.362 --> 1:09:12.017
spend all of the hours

1:09:12.060 --> 1:09:14.062
that I spend

1:09:14.106 --> 1:09:16.108
for the little pay that I get?

1:09:16.152 --> 1:09:17.457
Why would that be
off the record?

1:09:19.894 --> 1:09:22.897
Okay, fine.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:09:22.941 --> 1:09:25.030
- I mean...
- Well, because my...

1:09:25.073 --> 1:09:27.467
the off the record part
would be, when my accountant--

1:09:27.511 --> 1:09:28.947
when I said
to my accountant, I said,

1:09:28.990 --> 1:09:30.731
if I want to sell the store,
what's it worth?

1:09:30.775 --> 1:09:32.342
He said, nothing.
Because-- Because--

1:09:32.385 --> 1:09:34.300
Because he was not a reader.

1:09:34.344 --> 1:09:35.910
I am going to recite to you
the last paragraph

1:09:35.954 --> 1:09:38.870
on page 96,
which is how I sell this book.

1:09:38.913 --> 1:09:41.351
"While the moon smoothly
shifted the shadows

1:09:41.394 --> 1:09:43.266
from one side
of Edgewood to the other,

1:09:43.309 --> 1:09:46.660
Daily Alice dreamed she stood
in a flower starred field,

1:09:46.704 --> 1:09:48.532
where there grew
an oak tree and thorn

1:09:48.575 --> 1:09:50.098
in deep embrace,
their branches intertwined

1:09:50.142 --> 1:09:51.752
- like fingers."
- Oh, my God.

1:09:51.796 --> 1:09:53.406
"Far down the hall,
Sophie dreamed"--

1:09:53.450 --> 1:09:54.799
And this is how Sophie got
named-- my daughter

1:09:54.842 --> 1:09:56.496
- Sophie got named.
- Really?

1:09:56.540 --> 1:09:57.932
"Far down the hall,
Sophie dreamed there was

1:09:57.976 --> 1:10:00.500
a tiny door in her elbow,
open a crack

1:10:00.544 --> 1:10:02.328
through which
the wind blew,

1:10:02.372 --> 1:10:04.461
- blowing on her heart..."
- Oh, my God.

1:10:04.504 --> 1:10:06.245
- So...
- Let me take--

1:10:06.289 --> 1:10:07.681
I'm gonna take a picture
of that 'cause I wanna

1:10:07.725 --> 1:10:09.640
- recite it...
- [Matt laughing]

1:10:09.683 --> 1:10:11.207
- Patrick Leigh Fermor.
- Oh, really?

1:10:11.250 --> 1:10:13.470
Travel writer,
18 years old.

1:10:13.513 --> 1:10:15.602
Walked between...
18 years old,

1:10:15.646 --> 1:10:17.604
December, 1934,

1:10:17.648 --> 1:10:19.867
took a ferry
from London to Rotterdam

1:10:19.911 --> 1:10:22.305
and then walked
to Constantinople.

1:10:22.348 --> 1:10:25.177
- Is that right?
- He didn't quite make it

1:10:25.221 --> 1:10:26.831
because, you know,
halfway across,

1:10:26.874 --> 1:10:29.268
he fell in love,
like you would have too,

1:10:29.312 --> 1:10:30.878
with a Romanian princess

1:10:30.922 --> 1:10:32.358
and lived with her
for the next six years.

1:10:32.402 --> 1:10:33.751
Books on Buddhism.

1:10:33.794 --> 1:10:36.754
On religion
in general. Islam.

1:10:36.797 --> 1:10:39.583
There's the Classical,
Ancient World.

1:10:39.626 --> 1:10:41.846
In the days of the Gotham,

1:10:41.889 --> 1:10:44.022
there was a young woman
who used to come visit me--

1:10:44.065 --> 1:10:46.633
not me-- but would come
visit the bookstore.

1:10:46.677 --> 1:10:49.027
And we would hang out
and talk about Arthur Rimbaud.

1:10:49.070 --> 1:10:51.290
- Oh.
- She loved Arthur Rimbaud.

1:10:51.334 --> 1:10:53.292
And one day
she gave me three copies

1:10:53.336 --> 1:10:55.294
of this broadside
that she wrote.

1:10:55.338 --> 1:10:57.862
Do you know who wrote--
you know who this is?

1:10:57.905 --> 1:11:00.517
- Is it Einstein?
- No, this is...

1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:03.955
a drawing of the French poet
Rimbaud by Patti Smith.

1:11:03.998 --> 1:11:05.522
- Oh, really?
- This-- Patti Smith

1:11:05.565 --> 1:11:08.046
- gave me this.
- Holy shit.

1:11:08.089 --> 1:11:09.787
See the flying books?

1:11:09.830 --> 1:11:11.571
Oh, Jesus.
What is that?

1:11:11.615 --> 1:11:14.357
A book comes flying
out the window.

1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:17.055
The second-floor window--
it lands in the street.

1:11:17.098 --> 1:11:19.318
I jump in the street
like this.

1:11:19.362 --> 1:11:21.755
I'm a professional bookman.
I'll handle this.

1:11:21.799 --> 1:11:23.496
- [laughing]
- I kick it over.

1:11:23.540 --> 1:11:25.629
And the title is...

1:11:25.672 --> 1:11:27.979
as I say to the crowd
that assembles,

1:11:28.022 --> 1:11:31.287
"Just as I assumed,
a self-help book."

1:11:31.330 --> 1:11:32.984
[laughing]

1:11:35.987 --> 1:11:37.815
Six pairs of pants?
No Jew.

1:11:37.858 --> 1:11:39.425
One pair of pants.

1:11:39.469 --> 1:11:41.166
Six pairs of--
two pairs of boots?

1:11:41.209 --> 1:11:42.863
Listen, little Jew.
You won't have time

1:11:42.907 --> 1:11:44.691
to wear out one.

1:11:44.735 --> 1:11:46.519
And Jan Wiener says
to himself,

1:11:46.563 --> 1:11:48.347
"I'll come back
after this is over,

1:11:48.391 --> 1:11:51.350
and I'll kill this man."
He gets to Yugoslavia.

1:11:51.394 --> 1:11:54.788
He and his father apply
for... a visa to England.

1:11:54.832 --> 1:11:56.529
Nothing happens.
The Germans invade Yugoslavia

1:11:56.573 --> 1:11:58.966
in April of 1940.

1:11:59.010 --> 1:12:01.317
They start going-- running
from village to village.

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:03.188
One night,
his father says--

1:12:03.231 --> 1:12:05.712
They had dinner.
He was dressed for dinner.

1:12:05.756 --> 1:12:07.105
You would dress for dinner.

1:12:07.148 --> 1:12:08.802
But they played chess
before dinner.

1:12:10.500 --> 1:12:12.066
He sits down with his father,
his father takes a pawn

1:12:12.110 --> 1:12:13.938
and knocks it over.

1:12:13.981 --> 1:12:16.419
And Jan looks at him
and says, "What?"

1:12:16.462 --> 1:12:19.030
He says,
"Tonight, I kill myself

1:12:19.073 --> 1:12:21.032
because they come
for us soon,

1:12:21.075 --> 1:12:22.860
and this is
my only freedom."

1:12:22.903 --> 1:12:24.644
My-- He was
a medical importer.

1:12:24.688 --> 1:12:26.167
He had--
"I have poison.

1:12:26.211 --> 1:12:27.908
My wife took hers already.

1:12:27.952 --> 1:12:30.128
I have mine,
I have for you too."

1:12:30.171 --> 1:12:31.695
- Oh, my God.
- Jan says--

1:12:31.738 --> 1:12:34.567
He's 20 years old now,
Jan says...

1:12:34.611 --> 1:12:36.395
he looks out the window.
He tells me this.

1:12:36.439 --> 1:12:38.266
He says it was
a beautiful spring day.

1:12:38.310 --> 1:12:40.617
He says, "Father,
I choose to live."

1:12:40.660 --> 1:12:43.489
He escaped.
He got to Italy.

1:12:43.533 --> 1:12:45.404
He got under the belly...

1:12:45.448 --> 1:12:48.407
underneath the train
to ride from Trieste

1:12:48.451 --> 1:12:52.977
to... he was trying
to get to France,

1:12:53.020 --> 1:12:55.458
and he was captured
in Genoa.

1:12:55.501 --> 1:12:58.896
Thrown in a prisoner
of war camp. Escaped twice.

1:12:58.939 --> 1:13:01.942
Eventually the Allies came
up the boot, he was freed,

1:13:01.986 --> 1:13:04.510
and he joined
the British wing of--

1:13:04.554 --> 1:13:07.295
the Czech wing
of the RAF.

1:13:07.339 --> 1:13:10.429
And he ended the war
as a bombardier over...

1:13:10.473 --> 1:13:12.562
over Hamburg.

1:13:12.605 --> 1:13:13.998
- Wow.
- [laughter]

1:13:14.041 --> 1:13:16.479
He was a rascal,
just a great guy.

1:13:16.522 --> 1:13:18.045
So now he's in Prague.

1:13:18.089 --> 1:13:20.613
It's 2009,
and he has a stroke.

1:13:20.657 --> 1:13:23.224
And he's 89 years old.

1:13:23.268 --> 1:13:24.922
And I know
he's not coming home.

1:13:24.965 --> 1:13:26.967
So I go to visit him.

1:13:27.011 --> 1:13:28.534
And then
we'd stop at a café

1:13:28.578 --> 1:13:31.755
to have a drink
before we'd go home.

1:13:31.798 --> 1:13:33.452
And so I came back
and I said,

1:13:33.496 --> 1:13:36.760
I'm going to make a wine bar
for Jan Wiener.

1:13:36.803 --> 1:13:38.544
And that's why
we're sitting here today.

1:13:38.588 --> 1:13:40.372
[laughing]

1:13:40.416 --> 1:13:42.505
I feel pressure to do
this place justice.

1:13:45.856 --> 1:13:48.293
[soft guitar]

1:14:12.578 --> 1:14:15.494
[soft chatter]

1:14:18.845 --> 1:14:21.326
[sighing]

1:14:21.369 --> 1:14:22.936
Did you know
everybody loves you?

1:14:22.980 --> 1:14:25.330
- Yeah.
- That was pretty awesome.

1:14:25.373 --> 1:14:27.158
- Very, very.
- Not even 24 hours.

1:14:27.201 --> 1:14:29.900
No, yeah, yeah,
I mean... I mean,

1:14:29.943 --> 1:14:32.032
- why wait a whole 24 hours?
- Right?

1:14:32.076 --> 1:14:35.296
You know, who... has
the time to wait 24 hours?

1:14:35.340 --> 1:14:36.559
Do you want me
to pay for my books?

1:14:36.602 --> 1:14:37.821
Yeah, you want...
your books?

1:14:37.864 --> 1:14:39.779
Okay.

1:14:39.823 --> 1:14:42.216
I want to dance.

1:14:42.260 --> 1:14:43.827
There's an envelope
on the register there

1:14:43.870 --> 1:14:46.090
for Bob Romeo,
for the... rent.

1:14:46.133 --> 1:14:48.832
- Oh, I saw his email.
- Yeah, okay, right.

1:14:48.875 --> 1:14:51.095
So I wrote him back,
I said, "It's right there.

1:14:51.138 --> 1:14:53.184
Waiting for you.

1:14:53.227 --> 1:14:54.968
And I'll have more
for you soon.

1:14:55.012 --> 1:14:56.317
- Because of GoFundMe."
- Yeah.

1:14:56.361 --> 1:15:00.496
And, um, so finally
about a week ago,

1:15:00.539 --> 1:15:02.541
he knocked
on the door and says,

1:15:02.585 --> 1:15:04.891
"What's a fellow got to do
to get a check around here?"

1:15:04.935 --> 1:15:06.850
[laughter]

1:15:08.416 --> 1:15:10.506
My name is George Bailey.

1:15:10.549 --> 1:15:12.420
- Is it?
- Yes.

1:15:12.464 --> 1:15:14.292
And he has rose petals
right in here.

1:15:14.335 --> 1:15:16.120
Zuzu's petals.

1:15:16.163 --> 1:15:17.600
You know
who George Bailey was?

1:15:17.643 --> 1:15:19.602
- Yeah.
- Richest man in town.

1:15:19.645 --> 1:15:22.082
- He was a movie star.
- That's right.

1:15:22.126 --> 1:15:24.520
Did I think we would
make it in one day?

1:15:24.563 --> 1:15:27.218
No. But I wasn't
surprised when it did.

1:15:28.611 --> 1:15:30.830
In less than 24 hours.

1:15:32.397 --> 1:15:34.791
Yeah, it's just wild.

1:15:34.834 --> 1:15:37.576
People can accomplish--
people can--

1:15:37.620 --> 1:15:41.493
can make a difference in...
in a horrible time.

1:15:41.537 --> 1:15:43.582
And that's--
I didn't count on that

1:15:43.626 --> 1:15:47.281
being so...
so big for... everybody.

1:15:51.416 --> 1:15:53.200
Every day's like Christmas.

1:15:58.858 --> 1:16:01.557
And so, you know,
it's just pure gratitude.

1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:03.602
And what a run on GoFundMe.

1:16:03.646 --> 1:16:05.648
- What a run, huh?
- Well, you do know

1:16:05.691 --> 1:16:07.475
how to sing
this song correctly?

1:16:07.519 --> 1:16:09.390
- "Take me out to the..."

Magic is alive.

1:16:31.238 --> 1:16:33.371
Magic never died..."

1:16:33.414 --> 1:16:37.201
We reached it
in just about 23 hours.

1:16:37.244 --> 1:16:38.985
That's astonishing, Matt.

1:16:39.029 --> 1:16:43.424
So this is what we'll be able
to have me survive.

1:16:43.468 --> 1:16:45.688
Get a little bit out of debt.

1:16:45.731 --> 1:16:47.777
"For he today who sheds
his blood with me

1:16:47.820 --> 1:16:49.735

This day shall gentle
his condition;

1:16:51.519 --> 1:16:53.696
And gentlemen

Shall think themselves

1:16:55.349 --> 1:16:57.351

while any speaks with us

1:16:59.876 --> 1:17:02.400
who fought... with us
on Saint Crispin's Day."

1:17:02.443 --> 1:17:03.923
[laughing]

1:17:03.967 --> 1:17:05.708
[woman] I thank you
for being

1:17:05.751 --> 1:17:07.797
- such a kind human being.
- Thank you.

1:17:07.840 --> 1:17:10.016
And for giving us all
faith in this world

1:17:10.060 --> 1:17:11.670
in little ways.

1:17:11.714 --> 1:17:13.672
My dad died
when I was very young.

1:17:13.716 --> 1:17:16.109
But when I was
three years old,

1:17:16.153 --> 1:17:19.373
I was... marching through
the living room one day.

1:17:19.417 --> 1:17:21.593
And my dad said to me,
"Where are you going?"

1:17:21.637 --> 1:17:24.030
"Where are you going?"
And I said,

1:17:24.074 --> 1:17:25.728
"I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna smile at people,

1:17:25.771 --> 1:17:28.426
and they're gonna
be my friends."

1:17:28.469 --> 1:17:30.428
And I've been doing that...
[laughing]

1:17:30.471 --> 1:17:32.909
Mm-hmm, exactly.

1:17:32.952 --> 1:17:35.563
It's like...
the poem about music

1:17:35.607 --> 1:17:37.696
that I've been
learning lately.

1:17:37.740 --> 1:17:39.480
"Music.
You know what music is?

1:17:39.524 --> 1:17:41.961
It's everywhere.
It's in the air.

1:17:42.005 --> 1:17:45.704
We, and everything else,
are instruments."

1:17:45.748 --> 1:17:47.793
Is that your grandpa?

1:17:47.837 --> 1:17:49.665
Want to go see him?

1:17:49.708 --> 1:17:51.188
Want to go see Grandpa?

1:17:52.711 --> 1:17:54.713
Come here, you.
[gasping]

1:17:54.757 --> 1:17:56.367
Hi.

1:17:56.410 --> 1:17:58.282
- [babbling]
- Yah!

1:17:58.325 --> 1:18:00.240
Yah! Yah!

1:18:00.284 --> 1:18:03.026
I got ya!
[laughing]

1:18:03.069 --> 1:18:05.419
Are you--
are you a southpaw?

1:18:05.463 --> 1:18:07.639
Are you-- Are you trying to
throw for the third base side?

1:18:07.683 --> 1:18:09.728
No, the first base side.

1:18:09.772 --> 1:18:12.557
- You have a customer.
- Okay.

1:18:12.600 --> 1:18:14.037
You come over here with me,

1:18:14.080 --> 1:18:16.039
and we'll greet
the customers together.

1:18:16.082 --> 1:18:18.911
You can have anything in
the store except for the baby.

1:18:18.955 --> 1:18:21.653
I have to go write
some gift certificates now.

1:18:21.697 --> 1:18:23.524
But I think I'll wait.

1:18:23.568 --> 1:18:25.962
I think... it's more fun
to hang out with you.

1:18:27.833 --> 1:18:30.357
Have you been reading
any new books?

1:18:30.401 --> 1:18:32.316
Or do you keep
reading the same old book?

1:18:32.359 --> 1:18:34.057
You know--
You know who was...

1:18:34.100 --> 1:18:36.755
also a little baby when--
when she came in this store?

1:18:36.799 --> 1:18:39.105
Your mama.

1:18:39.149 --> 1:18:41.368
She was this age too
when she came in the store.

1:18:41.412 --> 1:18:43.457
And your Aunt Sophie.

1:18:43.501 --> 1:18:45.372
Yeah, they were all--

1:18:45.416 --> 1:18:46.939
They were both
really little,

1:18:46.983 --> 1:18:49.115
just like you are now.

1:18:49.159 --> 1:18:51.727
Yes. Yes.

1:18:51.770 --> 1:18:53.119
[voice] To place an order,
please call.

1:18:54.164 --> 1:18:55.731
Or ask me!

1:19:02.215 --> 1:19:04.000
Or walk away from me.

1:19:05.741 --> 1:19:07.655
Hi, you know
anything you'd like?

1:19:07.699 --> 1:19:11.137
Yes. She'd like
"The Vanishing Half."

1:19:11.181 --> 1:19:12.660
Okay.

1:19:12.704 --> 1:19:14.750
- One.
- One copy.

1:19:14.793 --> 1:19:16.229
We're gonna
sell a book now!

1:19:16.273 --> 1:19:18.710
[soft guitar]

1:19:32.768 --> 1:19:34.944
The result for me is
that I'm going to be able

1:19:34.987 --> 1:19:37.033
to stay in business.

1:19:37.076 --> 1:19:40.210
And the result
for the customers who gave

1:19:40.253 --> 1:19:42.995
and the friends
and the... clients

1:19:43.039 --> 1:19:46.129
and the...

1:19:46.172 --> 1:19:48.740
community...
who gave is that

1:19:48.784 --> 1:19:53.310
they get to be a part
of saving what they love.

1:19:53.353 --> 1:19:54.790
How often do you get
a chance to do that?

1:19:58.794 --> 1:20:00.534
- Thank you so much.
- From the second we donated,

1:20:00.578 --> 1:20:02.232
and we've been checking
all the time.

1:20:02.275 --> 1:20:03.973
- Thank you, thank you.
- We're just so heartened

1:20:04.016 --> 1:20:06.105
- for you.
- Okay, I appreciate it.

1:20:06.149 --> 1:20:07.759
- Thank you, thank you.
- It's going to allow you

1:20:07.803 --> 1:20:09.282
- to last.
- Yeah, I'm gonna...

1:20:09.326 --> 1:20:10.980
now I have to stay here.

1:20:11.023 --> 1:20:12.982
Thanks a lot.
Now I gotta keep working.

1:20:13.025 --> 1:20:14.679
- [laughing]
- I-- I--

1:20:14.722 --> 1:20:17.334
- Well, we're happy.
- Okay, thank you.

1:20:17.377 --> 1:20:19.553
- Blessings.
- Thank you.

1:20:19.597 --> 1:20:21.338
- Hi, hi, honey.
- Hi, I'll see you soon.

1:20:21.381 --> 1:20:23.862
Marian, yeah.

1:20:23.906 --> 1:20:26.996
You don't have a copy
of Muriel Barbery,

1:20:27.039 --> 1:20:28.606
"The Elegance
of a Hedgehog," do you?

1:20:28.649 --> 1:20:30.869
Maybe.
Maybe.

1:20:30.913 --> 1:20:33.176
Pull up and...
or circle around again,

1:20:33.219 --> 1:20:34.917
- I'll see if I can get one.
- Okay, I'll circle.

1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:36.266
- Okay.
- Thanks.

1:20:36.309 --> 1:20:39.095
[phone ringing]

1:20:39.138 --> 1:20:41.227
Hello, Bookstore.

1:20:41.271 --> 1:20:43.229
No, you can't come in.

1:20:43.273 --> 1:20:44.883
Not even you.
Not even you.

1:20:46.058 --> 1:20:47.581
Thank you, okay, bye.

1:20:54.937 --> 1:20:56.721
Before there were books...

1:21:01.900 --> 1:21:04.468
there was the oral
tradition of stories.

1:21:05.991 --> 1:21:07.863
"The ceaseless perishing.

1:21:07.906 --> 1:21:10.866
What an idea.
What maniac conceived it?

1:21:12.215 --> 1:21:14.695
And yet,
what a lovely day it is today.

1:21:14.739 --> 1:21:16.654
A gift of a day.

1:21:16.697 --> 1:21:18.525
A perfect day,
lacking nothing."

1:21:18.569 --> 1:21:20.701
[laughing]

1:21:20.745 --> 1:21:22.355
And that's what a...

1:21:24.444 --> 1:21:27.317
So I'm... just the place

1:21:27.360 --> 1:21:31.669
where that...
can happen for people.

1:21:31.712 --> 1:21:34.324
I'm just that place, and...

1:21:44.725 --> 1:21:47.772
and it's a... pleasure.

1:21:49.730 --> 1:21:50.906
And a privilege.

1:21:55.867 --> 1:21:57.521
It was a busy
Saturday afternoon

1:21:57.564 --> 1:21:59.436
late in August.

1:21:59.479 --> 1:22:02.395
And a guy
who I don't know...

1:22:02.439 --> 1:22:04.136
walks up, and he stands
in front of the desk.

1:22:04.180 --> 1:22:05.921
And he says...
"I see what you do."

1:22:08.358 --> 1:22:10.534
And he stops.
"I see what you do."

1:22:10.577 --> 1:22:15.147
He says, "You sit
in that chair all day long,

1:22:15.191 --> 1:22:18.107
surrounded by the things
you love most in the world.

1:22:18.150 --> 1:22:19.978
And all you do,
all day long,

1:22:20.022 --> 1:22:21.762
is talk to people

1:22:21.806 --> 1:22:23.634
about the things
you love most in the world.

1:22:25.244 --> 1:22:27.507
And the only time
you get interrupted

1:22:27.551 --> 1:22:29.031
is when someone wants
to give you money."

1:22:32.817 --> 1:22:34.862
That's my life.

"Leaving
any bookstore is hard,

especially
on a day in August"--

1:22:49.007 --> 1:22:50.748
Huh.

1:22:50.791 --> 1:22:52.750
"--when the street outside
burns and glares,

1:22:52.793 --> 1:22:55.796
and the books inside are
cool and crisp to the touch;

when the wind is blowing,

the ice is treacherous,

1:23:01.237 --> 1:23:03.456
and the books inside
seem to gather together

1:23:03.500 --> 1:23:04.849
in colorful warmth.

1:23:07.243 --> 1:23:09.941
It's hard to leave a bookstore
any day of the year, though,

1:23:09.985 --> 1:23:12.074
because a bookstore is
one of the few places

1:23:12.117 --> 1:23:15.512
where all the cantankerous,
conflicting, alluring

1:23:15.555 --> 1:23:17.340
voices of the world

1:23:17.383 --> 1:23:19.603
co-exist in peace and order,

1:23:19.646 --> 1:23:22.084
and the avid reader is
as free as a person

1:23:22.127 --> 1:23:24.869
can possibly be,
because she is free

1:23:24.912 --> 1:23:26.479
to choose among them."

1:23:27.828 --> 1:23:29.830
[phone ringing]

1:23:31.832 --> 1:23:33.573
Hello, Bookstore.

1:23:33.617 --> 1:23:35.880
[soft guitar]

1:24:43.948 --> 1:24:47.604
And as I was running back,
I remember, I saw a moose.

1:24:47.647 --> 1:24:49.040
The first time
I ever saw a moose,

1:24:49.084 --> 1:24:50.259
just standing there,
like, you know,

1:24:50.302 --> 1:24:52.130
lie, 50 yards away from me.

1:24:52.174 --> 1:24:53.827
Just standing
majestically...

1:24:53.871 --> 1:24:55.133
- ["phone off hook" beeping]
- Shit, did I have

1:24:55.177 --> 1:24:56.352
somebody on the phone?

1:24:57.962 --> 1:25:00.399
- I guess I did.
- You did?

1:25:00.443 --> 1:25:03.881
Maybe I just didn't
hang it up, um...

1:25:03.924 --> 1:25:05.622
I saw a moose, and...
[laughing]

1:25:05.665 --> 1:25:07.276
...and my first thought was,

1:25:07.319 --> 1:25:08.973
and you can edit this out:

1:25:09.016 --> 1:25:10.670
do moose eat Jews?

1:25:10.714 --> 1:25:13.499
[laughing]
That just came out of me.

1:25:13.543 --> 1:25:16.067
that was just...
[laughing]

1:25:16.111 --> 1:25:18.504
[soft guitar]

1:25:38.176 --> 1:25:44.226
W-R-I-T-E-R.

1:25:47.403 --> 1:25:49.056
Writer.

1:25:49.100 --> 1:25:50.928
[laughing]

1:25:50.971 --> 1:25:54.018
So, this...
you know what this is?

1:25:54.061 --> 1:25:56.325
This is a writer's block.

1:25:56.368 --> 1:25:58.805
