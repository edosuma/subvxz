00:00.493 --> 00:03.524
I can't believe this
night is finally here.

00:03.534 --> 00:07.309
This is what I've been looking
forward to since I came out.

00:07.319 --> 00:10.220
Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen. I'm Neil Everett..

00:10.230 --> 00:12.623
Welcome to the biggest
night of the year...

00:12.633 --> 00:17.127
All Hallow's Eve, Halloween,
The Gay Super Bowl!

00:17.196 --> 00:20.230
Expectations are high
that this will be...

00:20.299 --> 00:23.167
the biggest and best
Halloween in the history...

00:23.235 --> 00:24.983
of humankind.

00:24.993 --> 00:27.104
This is what it's been all about.

00:27.173 --> 00:30.139
It's a dream come true...
a night where I can totally be me

00:30.208 --> 00:31.208
with no judgment.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

00:50.819 --> 00:51.986
Oh!

00:52.054 --> 00:53.483
There's a flag on the gay.

00:53.885 --> 00:59.057
Synced and corrected by
johnyd13 ~ www.addic7ed.com ~

00:59.395 --> 01:03.062
Just the right amount of
curl and a subtle balayage.

01:03.131 --> 01:06.733
You, my friend, are going
to look perfect on me.

01:06.802 --> 01:09.469
Were you just talking to that wig?

01:09.538 --> 01:10.637
No.

01:10.706 --> 01:14.808
I was talking to myself, and it's
possible Paula... The wig heard me.

01:14.877 --> 01:16.009
Okay.

01:16.077 --> 01:18.077
Well, dare I ask what this is for?

01:18.146 --> 01:20.646
It's for my Halloween costume! Duh!

01:20.715 --> 01:23.482
I'm going as Beyoncé from the
Super Bowl halftime show.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.849
Now, I considered one of
her "Lemonade" looks,

01:25.859 --> 01:28.788
but I just don't want to pick
sides between her and J.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.157
Well, it seems like you
could've gone with something

01:31.226 --> 01:34.327
a little more, I don't know,
out of the box.

01:34.396 --> 01:36.495
You don't want me to
dress in drag, do you?

01:36.564 --> 01:38.764
Nope! Uh, no. No, I do not.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.467
Well, may I remind you that last
year, I went as Selena Gomez,

01:41.536 --> 01:43.101
the year before that, Taylor Swift,

01:43.170 --> 01:45.538
and Gaga the three years before that.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.306
Yes, I know that, but I...

01:47.374 --> 01:49.508
That was before I knew you were...

01:49.577 --> 01:51.376
- Gay?
- Yes, exactly.

01:51.446 --> 01:53.045
And back then, it just
seemed like innocent fun,

01:53.113 --> 01:56.114
and now, well... it... it just doesn't.

01:56.183 --> 02:00.118
Which is why I got you
the most amazing costume,

02:00.187 --> 02:02.291
and I really think you're gonna love it.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.057
Newsies.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.125
Damn it! You know I'm
obsessed with that movie!

02:07.194 --> 02:09.727
Remember that one Christmas
I asked for a newsstand?

02:09.795 --> 02:12.296
And I got you period newspapers
you can throw at people.

02:12.365 --> 02:14.632
Ha ha! Extree! Extree!

02:14.701 --> 02:17.034
Oh, wow. I look good in this hat.

02:17.103 --> 02:18.169
- Mm.
- Okay.

02:18.237 --> 02:19.546
All right, fine.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.990
I will wear your costume,
but only if you promise

02:22.058 --> 02:24.959
to stop micromanaging
my first gay Halloween.

02:24.969 --> 02:26.060
- Okay?
- Yeah.

02:26.129 --> 02:28.663
This is very important to me,
and I've been waiting for it forever.

02:28.731 --> 02:30.965
Fine. I'll stay out of your way...

02:31.034 --> 02:32.366
On the night that, statistically,

02:32.435 --> 02:34.402
has the most ritualistic
killings of the year.

02:35.972 --> 02:37.705
So, what are you two up to tonight?

02:37.774 --> 02:39.540
Jimmy and I are gonna
go trick-or-treating.

02:39.609 --> 02:41.401
Could be my last Halloween at home,

02:41.411 --> 02:42.910
so I thought I'd take my little sister

02:42.978 --> 02:44.244
around the block one more time.

02:44.314 --> 02:46.393
If that sounded dirty,
I didn't mean it to.

02:46.403 --> 02:47.538
Okay.

02:47.548 --> 02:49.717
My sewing club, now unionized, B-T-W,

02:49.786 --> 02:52.085
made us some sweet Bonnie
and Clyde costumes.

02:52.154 --> 02:55.189
I'm gonna be Bonnie,
because gender is fluid nowadays.

02:55.257 --> 02:57.825
Well, at least you picked
historical figures.

02:57.893 --> 03:00.093
You know, murderers, but still...

03:00.162 --> 03:03.563
So, you're totally fine with
Jimmy dressing in drag?

03:03.632 --> 03:05.432
Yes. In his case, it's just,

03:05.500 --> 03:08.101
you know, "I'm silly, and check me out."

03:08.170 --> 03:09.569
In your case, it's...

03:09.638 --> 03:11.905
"I'm single. Check me out."

03:14.743 --> 03:18.998
Well, welcome to the
worst day of my year.

03:19.501 --> 03:20.900
Why?

03:20.910 --> 03:23.650
Because Halloween is a horrible
night to be a cop. That's why.

03:23.719 --> 03:25.518
Everybody's drunk and
out looking for trouble.

03:25.587 --> 03:27.554
Used to be only kids dressed up,
and if you're lucky,

03:27.622 --> 03:29.222
you get a little razor
blade in your apple

03:29.290 --> 03:31.590
and slice your mouth open a little bit.

03:31.659 --> 03:33.792
Anyway, Kenny, looks like
it's just you and me again

03:33.862 --> 03:36.003
handing out candy, as usual.

03:36.013 --> 03:39.640
Actually, I will be enjoying my holiday

03:39.650 --> 03:43.069
with my people at
the big parade in Boystown.

03:43.137 --> 03:44.737
You will be doing no such thing.

03:44.805 --> 03:46.631
- Dad, please.
- Mm.

03:46.641 --> 03:49.107
Please help me convince her.

03:49.176 --> 03:50.942
Oh, no, I'm sorry, Kenny.

03:51.011 --> 03:53.311
I agree with Mom on this one, buddy.

03:53.381 --> 03:54.646
It's just not safe out there.

03:54.715 --> 03:56.482
I mean, one minute, you think
you're drinking lemonade,

03:56.550 --> 03:58.550
and the next, it winds
up being Molly water,

03:58.619 --> 04:00.452
and you're rolling balls for six hours.

04:00.521 --> 04:03.722
Okay. How about this?
Why don't we have a party?

04:04.931 --> 04:07.158
- A party, here?
- Yes.

04:07.227 --> 04:10.311
- And I can invite anyone I want?
- Yes.

04:10.849 --> 04:12.884
Even gay people?

04:13.066 --> 04:14.732
Yes.

04:14.801 --> 04:16.870
Dad, it's not called "rolling balls."

04:16.880 --> 04:18.324
It's called bowling.

04:22.241 --> 04:23.441
Ah.

04:23.510 --> 04:25.009
What do you want to do with these?

04:25.077 --> 04:27.111
Those aren't decorations, Pat.
They're actual cobwebs.

04:27.179 --> 04:28.746
No!

04:29.849 --> 04:31.382
What is this?

04:34.053 --> 04:36.120
It's a map of our neighborhood,

04:36.188 --> 04:39.156
with the Murphys' house circled
in skull and crossbones.

04:39.225 --> 04:40.991
Jimmy and Shannon aren't
going trick-or-treating.

04:41.060 --> 04:42.960
They're gonna go prank
the Murphys' house.

04:43.029 --> 04:44.861
Hooligans.

04:44.931 --> 04:47.123
Our own kids are hooligans?!

04:47.361 --> 04:49.499
Oh, I'm gonna teach
them a lesson tonight, boy.

04:49.568 --> 04:52.102
Yeah, I'm gonna scare them straight.

04:52.171 --> 04:53.804
I wish I could do that with Kenny.

04:53.872 --> 04:55.705
Yeah, I was a little surprised you
agreed to let him have a party here.

04:55.774 --> 04:57.808
- Well, it's better than the alternative.
- Well...

04:57.876 --> 05:00.043
Besides, he knows zero
gay kids to invite.

05:00.111 --> 05:01.945
Well, he does have that one
lesbian friend Allison.

05:02.013 --> 05:04.246
Yeah, but she's kind of a dud.

05:04.616 --> 05:06.115
I think I just stepped in gum.

05:06.184 --> 05:09.185
My party is gonna be so awesome.

05:09.254 --> 05:11.844
- Who's coming?
- Who's not coming?

05:11.854 --> 05:14.557
My mom said I can invite as
many gay kids as I want.

05:14.625 --> 05:18.061
But you and I are the
only gay kids at school.

05:18.129 --> 05:20.196
Okay, fine. So nobody's coming yet.

05:20.265 --> 05:23.132
But don't you worry your
plain little face, Allison,

05:23.201 --> 05:25.854
because we will find gay kids to invite.

05:25.864 --> 05:28.637
I mean, Halloween is a magical
night where anything can happen.

05:28.706 --> 05:30.172
Including murder.

05:30.240 --> 05:34.009
Yeah. Well, hopefully not,
but in any case,

05:34.078 --> 05:36.044
we're gonna fill my house to capacity.

05:36.113 --> 05:37.412
How?

05:40.250 --> 05:42.050
By making a deal with the devil.

05:42.119 --> 05:43.518
What do you want, Kenny?

05:43.587 --> 05:44.987
I like your costume.

05:45.055 --> 05:47.222
We're doing "Faust." I'm not in it.

05:47.291 --> 05:48.890
I'm just supporting the others who are.

05:48.959 --> 05:50.325
That's what it's like
at my new school...

05:50.394 --> 05:51.759
We support each other.

05:51.828 --> 05:54.363
Unlike my old school,
where you tongued my prom date.

05:54.431 --> 05:57.532
Stuart, that was months ago.
Haven't we moved on?

05:57.601 --> 06:00.401
Through dance therapy, yes, I have.

06:00.470 --> 06:03.170
I am having a killer
Halloween party at my house,

06:03.239 --> 06:05.206
and I'm willing to have you there

06:05.274 --> 06:08.242
if you bring along
some of your new gay friends.

06:08.311 --> 06:10.845
Okay, normally,
I wouldn't even consider this,

06:10.914 --> 06:14.015
but my house is off-limits
since the "Equus" wrap party,

06:14.083 --> 06:16.283
so I'm willing to grant your request.

06:16.352 --> 06:17.518
There's just one hitch.

06:17.586 --> 06:18.685
Bring it.

06:18.754 --> 06:21.389
I must be referred to as the host.

06:22.925 --> 06:25.292
Okay. And I will be?

06:25.361 --> 06:27.260
The sad girl in the corner.

06:30.099 --> 06:33.233
Hey, maybe before we prank the
heck out of the Murphys' house,

06:33.301 --> 06:35.523
we should stop by a
few places for candy.

06:35.533 --> 06:36.775
Jimmy, I need you to focus.

06:36.785 --> 06:39.469
I'll throw the eggs while you fill
their mailbox with shaving cream.

06:39.537 --> 06:40.738
Then we run like hell.

06:40.748 --> 06:43.640
If anyone catches us, we keep
mum about the whole thing.

06:43.708 --> 06:46.009
"Mum" means quiet. It's also a flower.

06:46.078 --> 06:47.778
Why do you look so confused?

06:50.582 --> 06:52.482
Have you noticed that car following us?

06:52.550 --> 06:53.949
Yeah.

06:54.018 --> 06:56.218
What if it's a
Freddy-Krueger-type serial killer

06:56.288 --> 06:58.087
who chains us up in our dreams?

06:59.624 --> 07:01.691
We can't go to sleep.
Shannon, don't fall asleep.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.660
Calm down and walk faster.

07:03.728 --> 07:05.194
Jimmy and Shannon,

07:05.263 --> 07:07.196
stop walking.

07:07.265 --> 07:09.498
Oh, my God.

07:09.566 --> 07:11.867
The serial killer sounds just like Dad.

07:11.936 --> 07:13.035
Jimmy, it is Dad.

07:13.104 --> 07:14.536
That's what he wants
us to think, Shannon!

07:14.605 --> 07:16.005
Jimmy, it's me, Dad.

07:16.073 --> 07:18.334
Get in the damn car.

07:19.476 --> 07:21.143
Screw you, Krueger!

07:23.880 --> 07:25.180
Not worth it!

07:27.083 --> 07:29.217
Can't believe nobody's here yet.

07:29.286 --> 07:31.986
I really hope Stuart didn't
screw me on this one.

07:33.156 --> 07:34.989
This is it. This is them.

07:35.058 --> 07:37.592
Allison, the best Halloween of our lives

07:37.661 --> 07:40.929
is about to start right now.

07:44.234 --> 07:46.434
Oh, man.

07:47.503 --> 07:50.538
A...pigeon whisperer?

07:50.606 --> 07:52.540
Stick of spearmint gum
with flies all over it.

07:52.608 --> 07:54.909
Um... Garbage Island.

07:54.978 --> 07:57.545
No! I'm Tippi Hedren from "The Birds."

07:57.613 --> 07:59.927
I'm trying to impress Steve
the Colorist from work.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.931
He and his gay buddies are
gonna go down to Boystown

08:01.941 --> 08:04.117
for the parade and, fingers crossed,
I'm gonna be with them.

08:04.186 --> 08:05.353
Oh, don't talk about the parade.

08:05.421 --> 08:06.487
That's where Kenny wants to go.

08:06.556 --> 08:08.456
Fine, but when Steve texts, I'm outtie.

08:08.524 --> 08:10.524
I'm checking things off my bucket list,

08:10.593 --> 08:12.592
and number one is me getting
my own gay entourage.

08:12.661 --> 08:14.561
Really? That's number one?

08:16.332 --> 08:17.464
Well...

08:17.532 --> 08:19.799
- What are those two doing?
- Having a party.

08:20.901 --> 08:24.137
- But no one is here.
- Exactly. I win.

08:30.044 --> 08:33.546
You came! I mean, uh, cool, yeah.

08:33.615 --> 08:35.381
Um, I thought maybe you
weren't gonna make it.

08:35.450 --> 08:37.049
Yeah, I'm a bit late
because my extensions

08:37.118 --> 08:38.650
got tangled in my belly-button ring,

08:38.720 --> 08:39.818
which got tangled in my snake.

08:39.888 --> 08:42.154
#Britney Troubles.

08:42.222 --> 08:46.392
Any too-hooters,
my party has officially begun!

08:46.460 --> 08:47.994
Yeah.

08:48.062 --> 08:49.962
Yes!

08:50.031 --> 08:51.764
Hey. Welcome.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.065
- Hey.
- Where...

08:53.134 --> 08:54.369
Wh-Why?

08:54.379 --> 08:55.467
Oh.

08:55.536 --> 08:56.735
- Did I not tell you?
- No.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.804
Stuart transferred to
the Oscar Wilde School

08:58.873 --> 09:00.306
for the Performing Arts.

09:00.375 --> 09:03.942
This is going to be the most
amazingly gay Halloween ever!

09:04.011 --> 09:05.110
Yeah!

09:07.047 --> 09:09.748
I'm just as surprised as you are.

09:12.420 --> 09:14.319
It's me... Allison.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.821
This is so much better than
I could've ever imagined.

09:21.831 --> 09:23.673
I mean, this could be
our new crew, Allison.

09:23.683 --> 09:25.201
I've never had a crew before.

09:25.211 --> 09:27.744
Do you think that Black
Swan's checking me out?

09:27.813 --> 09:31.415
Totally. The tension is palpable.

09:31.484 --> 09:34.251
Let me know if I'm coming on too strong.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.852
I was wondering where the bathroom was.

09:35.921 --> 09:37.954
- Oh, yeah, totally. It's right...
- I'm the host. My party.

09:38.024 --> 09:40.090
It's my party, everyone!

09:40.159 --> 09:41.691
I'll tell you where the bathroom is.

09:43.996 --> 09:45.428
Where's the bathroom?

09:49.034 --> 09:52.101
And can we please do
something about the lighting?

09:54.729 --> 09:56.706
I'm digging your hot-cop costume.

09:56.775 --> 09:58.508
I am a cop. I work here.

09:58.577 --> 09:59.933
Hey, Pat

09:59.943 --> 10:03.513
and Pat's children, who are
handcuffed for some reason.

10:03.523 --> 10:05.348
Gloria, it's nice to see you again.

10:05.417 --> 10:07.150
Especially at your place of work

10:07.218 --> 10:08.951
- and not on a date with my dad.
- Hey.

10:09.020 --> 10:10.953
Told you the cuffs were a bit much, Dad.

10:11.022 --> 10:13.523
Well, if you'll tell me why you
were gonna prank the Murphys,

10:13.591 --> 10:14.890
I'll happily take the cuffs off.

10:14.959 --> 10:17.392
We have to keep mum, Dad.

10:17.461 --> 10:19.194
"Mum". "Dad".

10:21.191 --> 10:23.465
I'm happy this is a joke for you.

10:23.534 --> 10:25.335
Listen, these two are in trouble,

10:25.345 --> 10:27.612
but I need to go handle this mermaid
who was just urinating in public.

10:27.681 --> 10:28.713
Can you watch them for a minute?

10:28.782 --> 10:31.156
Yeah, sure. But what are they in for?

10:31.166 --> 10:33.166
They're charged with possession...

10:34.294 --> 10:35.720
of eggs.

10:36.957 --> 10:39.623
No prison can hold me.

10:42.252 --> 10:43.785
Still no text from Steve the Colorist.

10:43.853 --> 10:46.421
I mean, I'm the one who
introduced him to skinny mimosas.

10:46.490 --> 10:47.755
Does that count for nothing?

10:47.824 --> 10:48.923
Enough of your gay problems.

10:48.992 --> 10:50.458
I'm surrounded with gay
problems of my own.

10:50.468 --> 10:53.595
I got a houseful of boys in stilettos
putting divots in my floor,

10:53.663 --> 10:55.679
and all these snacks look like [bleep]

10:55.689 --> 10:57.164
Why would you ever
serve a whole cucumber?

10:57.166 --> 10:58.900
I didn't think anyone was gonna show up!

10:58.902 --> 11:01.390
You chop up the corn dogs and
I'll slice the cucumbers...

11:01.400 --> 11:03.871
I didn't think anyone was in the yard.

11:05.408 --> 11:06.840
Your party sucks.

11:06.909 --> 11:09.176
It's freezing, and the
food is cut up for babies.

11:09.245 --> 11:10.461
I thought it was your party.

11:10.471 --> 11:12.446
Well, now that it sucks, it's yours.

11:12.515 --> 11:14.014
And if it doesn't get any better,

11:14.083 --> 11:16.850
I'm taking my gays and I'm leaving.

11:18.433 --> 11:20.019
Extree! Extree!

11:20.029 --> 11:22.556
Read all about the best
Halloween party ever!

11:22.558 --> 11:25.792
Why it's so cold?
It's like a meat locker in here.

11:25.861 --> 11:27.060
And not the gay bar downtown,
The Meat Locker,

11:27.129 --> 11:28.528
which I actually hear is quite warm.

11:28.538 --> 11:29.963
I-Is it cold?

11:30.032 --> 11:32.099
Because I'm... I'm really sweating.

11:32.167 --> 11:34.901
Step away from the thermostat.

11:37.006 --> 11:38.972
55 degrees?

11:39.041 --> 11:40.540
You are trying to De-gay my party!

11:40.609 --> 11:42.891
I am not.

11:43.278 --> 11:46.306
I blended all the Popsicles into
slushies like you asked, Eileen.

11:46.316 --> 11:48.881
Well, I just think it's more
fun to drink a Popsicle.

11:48.950 --> 11:52.118
Mom, you promised that you'd be
cool with me having this party.

11:52.187 --> 11:54.987
And I am. I'm totally okay.

11:55.056 --> 11:57.489
I am so cool. I am totally cool.

11:57.558 --> 11:58.647
Really?

11:58.657 --> 12:00.960
Because if you're not, I will
gladly leave and go to the parade.

12:01.029 --> 12:02.094
I'll go with you!

12:02.163 --> 12:04.096
No! No one is going anywhere.

12:04.165 --> 12:07.099
I am completely comfortable
with this party.

12:07.168 --> 12:09.234
Look, I'll even...
Look, I'll turn it up.

12:09.303 --> 12:11.403
See? I don't even know
how that happened.

12:11.472 --> 12:13.605
Okay, and you are comfortable

12:13.674 --> 12:16.941
with me being completely
myself at this party?

12:17.010 --> 12:18.510
Yes.

12:18.579 --> 12:20.512
100%.

12:20.581 --> 12:22.814
You be you.

12:22.824 --> 12:26.652
You know, just as long as
you're being you here.

12:26.720 --> 12:27.852
Right?

12:28.220 --> 12:29.754
At home.

12:32.425 --> 12:33.591
- This?
- Nothing with raisins.

12:33.660 --> 12:34.877
- I don't like taffy.
- Okay. What about that?

12:34.887 --> 12:36.460
- Shannon, that's just a box of raisins.
- Okay, well, I can't see.

12:36.529 --> 12:37.996
Okay, move. Just go down, left.

12:38.065 --> 12:38.997
You're just touching gum.

12:39.066 --> 12:41.332
There. There! That one. You got it.

12:41.401 --> 12:42.600
Okay.

12:42.669 --> 12:44.828
You got to put it in my mouth.

12:45.505 --> 12:46.937
What are you doing?

12:47.006 --> 12:49.973
You guys are here to be
punished, not to have fun.

12:50.042 --> 12:51.975
This is actually very stressful, Dad!

12:52.044 --> 12:53.944
Oh, Jimmy.

12:54.731 --> 12:56.347
Can you please get
somebody to cover for you

12:56.416 --> 12:57.948
so you can help me break my kids?

12:57.958 --> 12:59.283
Yes, I miss being in the field.

12:59.352 --> 13:01.356
- Interrogations were my specialty.
- Oh, really?

13:01.366 --> 13:03.053
Yeah, I always wondered why
you're stuck behind this desk.

13:03.122 --> 13:04.354
I shot my partner.

13:04.423 --> 13:06.190
Oh. I did not know that.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.293
You see?

13:10.362 --> 13:12.529
A boy in a dress just walked by

13:12.598 --> 13:15.332
and stuck an entire
corn dog in his mouth.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.519
And I am fine with it!

13:17.529 --> 13:19.369
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.854
You know what they say.

13:37.922 --> 13:42.725
When Mom gives you lemons...
Beyoncé makes lemonade.

13:48.448 --> 13:51.339
- Mom, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay. All good.

13:51.648 --> 13:52.547
Really? You're not upset about this?

13:52.616 --> 13:54.549
What? No. Not at all.

13:54.618 --> 13:56.584
You make a great Beyoncé.

13:56.653 --> 14:00.621
If Beyoncé had a pale,
small, boy's body.

14:00.690 --> 14:02.256
Sweet burn.

14:02.325 --> 14:03.958
You're more like a Shetland Beyoncé.

14:05.661 --> 14:07.161
What? What's happening?

14:07.230 --> 14:09.297
Mom, you're throwing shade,

14:09.365 --> 14:11.799
and you are surprisingly good at it.

14:11.868 --> 14:12.834
Do me. Do me.

14:12.902 --> 14:14.935
Okay. Well, uh...

14:15.003 --> 14:16.670
you look just like Britney.

14:16.739 --> 14:18.038
Mm-hmm.

14:18.106 --> 14:20.774
The dirty, barefoot Britney
from the gas-station bathroom.

14:22.039 --> 14:23.577
Yas, Queen.

14:23.646 --> 14:25.111
Gays like throwing shade?

14:25.180 --> 14:26.613
Oh, we live for it.

14:26.682 --> 14:28.816
It's not a compliment
unless it's backhanded.

14:28.884 --> 14:30.116
Uh, and ok...

14:30.185 --> 14:32.485
Oh, I'm guessing you're JLo.

14:32.554 --> 14:35.588
But in your case,
it's more like J-E-L-L-O.

14:37.726 --> 14:38.624
Oh!

14:38.693 --> 14:40.927
Her cruelty is their joy.

14:43.765 --> 14:46.333
Why are you so obsessed
with pranking the Murphys?

14:46.401 --> 14:49.335
If you're going to interrogate
me, I demand a lawyer.

14:50.194 --> 14:51.971
All you need is a legal guardian,

14:52.039 --> 14:53.450
and I'm it.

14:53.776 --> 14:55.307
Nice try with the cup,

14:55.377 --> 14:56.777
but you're not gonna get my prints.

14:57.411 --> 14:58.611
You're my daughter.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.279
I have your footprint in clay.

15:00.348 --> 15:01.881
I'm not telling you anything.

15:01.949 --> 15:02.882
Now, Jimmy...

15:02.950 --> 15:04.016
Please! I can't keep mum.

15:04.085 --> 15:05.217
I don't want to keep mum.

15:05.286 --> 15:06.651
I don't even know what "mum" means!

15:06.720 --> 15:08.053
Okay, I'll tell you everything!

15:08.122 --> 15:10.122
You know, confessing will
make everything easier.

15:10.191 --> 15:11.290
Will it?

15:11.359 --> 15:13.292
Stop asking me questions back!

15:13.361 --> 15:15.627
And sometimes I don't brush
my teeth before I go to bed.

15:15.696 --> 15:17.462
And I pretend to tip the baristas

15:17.531 --> 15:18.797
so that they'll like me.

15:18.866 --> 15:22.801
And just once, I was doing what boys do,

15:22.870 --> 15:24.836
and I didn't have any Kleenex,

15:24.905 --> 15:26.805
so I used my mom's good vase,

15:26.874 --> 15:29.173
and then she put roses in the vase,

15:29.242 --> 15:30.764
and they died.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.146
Pat.

15:35.215 --> 15:37.081
He told me everything.

15:37.150 --> 15:38.482
Damn it, Jimmy!

15:40.322 --> 15:42.720
Honestly, I think you just
had a kind of a heavy hand

15:42.789 --> 15:44.319
with the eyeliner, hon.

15:44.329 --> 15:46.090
You use a pencil, not a paint brush.

15:46.159 --> 15:47.325
Oh, my God!

15:47.394 --> 15:49.360
It's Steve the Colorist from work!

15:49.429 --> 15:51.495
This is my chance to impress him.

15:51.564 --> 15:53.697
Hey, where you at, you lazy-eyed queen?

15:53.766 --> 15:57.108
Yeah, you heard me.

15:57.118 --> 16:00.270
You're a flaming queen
with a big-old lazy eye.

16:00.339 --> 16:03.273
Hello?

16:12.636 --> 16:15.385
How do they know all the same moves?

16:15.387 --> 16:17.467
Theater nerds. The worst.

16:26.998 --> 16:28.965
Oh, I don't... Look, I...

16:52.146 --> 16:53.202
Get it, girl!

17:00.145 --> 17:01.113
Hi.

17:01.123 --> 17:03.799
So, the Halloween of my
dreams had actually come true.

17:03.868 --> 17:05.834
I was being my true self...

17:05.903 --> 17:08.637
and my mom was being... hers.

17:08.705 --> 17:11.740
And we were both being accepted.

17:11.809 --> 17:15.776
I may have even found myself a crew.

17:16.794 --> 17:19.646
No, no, no. Why did I change?
Why did I change?

17:19.715 --> 17:21.616
Oh. That's right.

17:21.684 --> 17:23.775
Because I look fierce.

17:32.595 --> 17:33.866
What's going on?

17:33.876 --> 17:35.863
- What?
- Party's over.

17:35.932 --> 17:38.465
You all look ridiculous,
and I want you out of my house.

17:38.535 --> 17:39.867
You go, girl.

17:39.936 --> 17:42.837
No, she's not playing
anymore. She's serious.

17:42.906 --> 17:45.973
It's so hard to tell with her.

17:46.042 --> 17:49.510
Well, Jimmy confessed more
than I ever wanted to know.

17:49.578 --> 17:52.546
May I suggest getting your
entire house steam-cleaned?

17:52.614 --> 17:55.882
Why did they want to
prank the Murphys' house?

17:55.951 --> 17:58.685
They overheard the Murphys saying
that you guys were all going to hell

17:58.754 --> 18:01.121
because you're getting
divorced and Kenny is gay.

18:01.190 --> 18:02.456
What?

18:02.525 --> 18:04.324
They didn't tell you 'cause
they thought you'd feel bad.

18:04.393 --> 18:06.392
Well, I do.

18:06.461 --> 18:07.727
I feel awful.

18:07.796 --> 18:10.196
Haters gonna hate, Pat.
Haters gonna hate.

18:11.407 --> 18:12.966
I learned that after I shot my partner.

18:13.035 --> 18:17.003
Oh, my God. What have I
done to them tonight?

18:17.072 --> 18:19.305
I'm a horrible father.

18:19.374 --> 18:21.920
No, you're not. I mean,
you're a little overprotective,

18:21.930 --> 18:23.476
but your kids are amazing.

18:23.545 --> 18:27.380
Guys, I had no idea you did
this to protect us and Kenny.

18:27.449 --> 18:29.182
I never would've put you through this.

18:29.250 --> 18:32.218
I'm so sorry. I love you.

18:32.287 --> 18:35.854
Aww. The thought of having
kids has always been...

18:35.923 --> 18:38.490
the worst life I could imagine.

18:38.559 --> 18:40.359
But your kids are way
less annoying than most.

18:41.295 --> 18:42.427
I hope we get to hang out again.

18:42.496 --> 18:45.598
I'm flattered, but you're very old.

18:51.973 --> 18:53.706
Phew!

18:58.612 --> 19:01.779
I thought I could do it. I really did.

19:03.183 --> 19:06.418
You know, for a minute,
I really thought you could, too.

19:06.487 --> 19:10.589
It's just that... hearing about
you kissing a boy at prom

19:10.657 --> 19:13.257
and then actually seeing
you kiss a boy...

19:14.928 --> 19:18.529
They're two very different things.

19:18.598 --> 19:20.564
And I'm your mother.

19:20.634 --> 19:23.901
I really don't want to
see you kissing anybody.

19:24.861 --> 19:26.704
I get that.

19:26.773 --> 19:29.375
I don't want to see you
kissing anyone, either.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.808
If it's anything like the way
you eat corn, I'm terrified.

19:31.877 --> 19:33.810
It's the sound, isn't it?

19:35.981 --> 19:37.948
But, look, um...

19:38.689 --> 19:40.204
kissing aside,

19:41.387 --> 19:43.954
if you won't let me be gay here,

19:44.023 --> 19:45.989
I can't be here.

19:46.058 --> 19:47.590
This is my worst fear.

19:47.660 --> 19:50.794
I-I really don't want to
lose you to this new...

19:50.863 --> 19:53.013
- gay world.
- That's the thing.

19:53.023 --> 19:57.267
It isn't some separate whole thing, Mom.

19:57.335 --> 19:59.102
I mean, there's a place for you in it.

19:59.171 --> 20:02.630
I mean, look at tonight...
You were the Belle of the gay ball.

20:03.908 --> 20:07.109
I'll get there, you know? I know I will.

20:07.179 --> 20:10.913
I'm just gonna need you
to go slow with me.

20:10.982 --> 20:12.576
Slower than we've been going?

20:12.586 --> 20:15.151
Mom, we're like an episode
of "The Night Of."

20:15.220 --> 20:17.787
I bet you'd be good at
throwing shade, too.

20:18.580 --> 20:21.323
- I can hold my own.
- All right.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.801
- Read me.
- Um...

20:26.030 --> 20:27.296
Is the...

20:27.364 --> 20:30.800
librarian convention in town?

20:30.868 --> 20:33.035
And you call yourself my son.

20:33.104 --> 20:34.269
I know.

20:34.338 --> 20:37.539
Kenny, I bought these khakis
at the grocery store.

20:37.608 --> 20:40.523
They have pleats in the front and back.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.010
Why?

20:45.335 --> 20:47.721
Well, you know, as everything
in our lives is changing,

20:47.731 --> 20:49.903
it's good to know our kids
are on the right path.

20:49.913 --> 20:54.248
Yes, maybe not the path
we imagined, but, yes.

20:54.944 --> 20:56.285
And even after I move out,

20:56.295 --> 20:58.185
I still want to do stuff
together as a family, okay?

20:58.254 --> 20:59.253
Definitely.

20:59.322 --> 21:01.255
This is the Murphys' house, guys.

21:01.324 --> 21:03.491
No one ever gets egged the
night after Halloween.

21:03.560 --> 21:04.746
O'Neals rock!

21:04.756 --> 21:08.415
Okay, Jimmy, we could also
be doing this anonymously.

21:14.337 --> 21:15.903
Run! Run!

21:15.913 --> 21:17.571
Serpentine! Serpentine!
